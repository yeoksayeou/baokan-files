Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 24th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, delivered a speech at the afternoon session of the World Peace Council on the 22nd. The full text is as follows:

　　Mr. Chairman, esteemed council members, and distinguished delegates:

　　Since the Second World Peace Congress in November of last year, all developments in the world have further clarified a truth: the people of the world want peace. Only a few want war.

　　However, the few imperialist aggressors who want only war and not peace have not learned the lessons they should have from the new changes in the world. They remain immersed in the frenzy of war. American imperialists have invaded China's territory of Taiwan and China's neighbor, Korea. Not only do they not want to end their military adventure, but they are also attempting to expand this war of aggression and ignite the flames of war across the entire world. Domestically, they are expanding their military budget without limit and intensifying preparations for launching a world war; they are arming West Germany and Japan at the most rapid pace to serve as accomplices in their war of aggression; and they are tightly binding Britain, France, and other capitalist countries to their war chariot.

　　The people of China, Korea, the Soviet Union, Asian countries, and countries around the world hope for an early end to the Korean War and a genuine peace. Not long ago, representatives of twelve countries, including India and Egypt, submitted a proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. China has consistently advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. On January 17th, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese people, sent a telegram to the United Nations Political Committee, proposing a four-point peace plan, suggesting a seven-nation conference including China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, India, and Egypt to negotiate the end of the Korean War, the withdrawal of American armed forces from Taiwan, and other issues related to peace in the Far East. In his reply to the memorandum from the Indian Ambassador to China on January 22nd, Minister Zhou Enlai clearly stated: "Once the principle of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is accepted and implemented, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will be responsible for persuading the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to return to their country." However, the American government insists on invading Korea and Taiwan, and resolutely opposes all reasonable peace proposals. Using threats and inducements, it forced a majority of member states of the United Nations to reject the proposal of India and twelve other countries, and instead passed the shameful, reactionary, and extremely barbarous proposal of the United States that slanderously accuses China of "aggression" against Korea. This has closed the door to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through negotiation. The American government's willful behavior further exposes the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, and once again proves that it is the mortal enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, and the mortal enemy of world peace.

　　It is very clear that the American government is forcing a majority of countries in the United Nations to illegally pass this proposal to slander China. Its purpose is not only to cover up its aggression against Korea and China, but also to create an excuse for further expanding its war actions. This is a new intimidation and threat to China, Korea, Asian countries, and countries around the world. Although representatives of most countries know that the American proposal is a dangerous thing, and that its passage will inevitably encourage American aggression, carrying the risk of dragging all of humanity into war, the majority of countries in the United Nations have nevertheless succumbed to the will of the United States. This is truly an unprecedented and shameful chapter in the history of the United Nations. The majority of countries in the United Nations, following the will of the American government and violating the hopes of the people of the world, have made the United Nations unable to fulfill its responsibility to safeguard human security and peace, and have nakedly turned it into a tool for the American government to wage wars of aggression. The cause of striving for world peace cannot but rely on the efforts of our own people in various countries.

　　No matter how the American aggressors struggle, and no matter how tortuous the development of the Korean War, the people of China and Korea, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, will surely achieve final victory and liberate the entire Korean peninsula. The 30 million people of Korea are now living in dire straits, with many women without husbands, many husbands without wives, many children without parents, and many parents without children. The disasters inflicted on the Korean people by the American aggressors are both deep and severe. We call on all peace-loving people of the world to jointly assist the Korean people. The Korean people urgently need medical equipment to heal the wounded and save the dying, and various supplies to rebuild their peaceful lives. Assisting the Korean people to defeat the American aggressors is one of the main tasks of the world's people in striving for lasting peace and opposing wars of aggression today.

　　While launching the war of aggression against Korea, the American government is also actively preparing for a larger-scale war on a global scale. Truman has sent Eisenhower to Western Europe to organize an army of more than one million, especially to illegally arm West Germany. Truman also sent Dulles to Tokyo to engage in activities, plotting a unilateral peace treaty with Japan, the main purpose of which is to arm Japan. Arming West Germany and Japan are important steps in America's new war preparations. West Germany and Japan have become the two wheels of America's future new war. No matter how desperately America expands its military equipment, it must be matched with these two wheels before the new war train can start.

　　The Chinese people know that the people of Western European countries are fiercely opposed to Eisenhower's organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Wherever Eisenhower goes, the peace-loving people there rise up and attack him. Everywhere they shout: "Eisenhower, get out!" Eisenhower wants to resurrect German fascism, but it is not easy to bring the dead back to life. Germany has changed. The German people have established their own democratic republic. The people of West Germany have tasted enough of the bitterness of war and know that war only benefits a small number of big capitalists, while it is a great disaster for the people. Therefore, they oppose arming West Germany and will never willingly act as cannon fodder for the United States. We believe that the people of European countries can completely shatter the American conspiracy to arm West Germany, and can shatter Eisenhower's conspiracy to organize the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　I should report to you, gentlemen, that in the East, the United States is actively arming Japan, just as the United States is arming West Germany in the West.

　　Before the war, Japanese imperialism was the most brutal and vicious aggressor in the East.

　　Japanese imperialism's policy of aggression was mainly aimed at China, and the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese aggression also began the earliest. In 1937, when the Japanese aggressors launched a large-scale war of aggression against China, the Chinese people finally rose up and carried out an eight-year war of resistance against Japan regardless of everything and unyieldingly. During these eight long years, the people of the whole country endured a painful life that no one could endure. Gentlemen, the disasters that Japan brought to China began with our grandfather's generation. Chinese children over the age of five today can all accuse Japan of the harm it did to us. Countless cities and villages were destroyed by the artillery fire of the Japanese invaders, and countless happy families were wiped out. During the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, according to incomplete estimates, more than ten million lives were lost across China, and public and private property losses were valued at approximately US$50 billion. As for the losses before 1937 and many indirect damages, it is difficult to calculate. But the Chinese people are not only good at lamenting, but we are also better at fighting against the enemies who oppress and enslave us. The outstanding sons and daughters of China stepped onto the battlefield, not hesitating to shed their blood and sacrifice their lives, fighting to the end one after another. Finally, we won the final victory in the war against Japan.

　　The old Japan that invaded Asia - Japanese imperialism - died in August 1945. At that time, the Allied countries, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, entrusted MacArthur to administer post-surrender Japan. The purpose of administering Japan, that is, MacArthur's task, was to implement the terms of Japan's unconditional surrender, that is, to realize the Potsdam Proclamation. This Potsdam Proclamation was signed by China, the United States, and Britain, participated in by the Soviet Union, and unconditionally accepted by Japan upon surrender. This Potsdam Proclamation was written by the world's people with blood and tears, sacrificing more than ten million lives and spending eight years of war. From August 1945 to today, for five and a half years, our attitude, policy, and guidelines towards Japan have only been one: to realize the Potsdam Proclamation! We also have only one requirement for MacArthur, who was entrusted by the Allied countries to administer Japan: to realize the Potsdam Proclamation!

　　The Potsdam Proclamation does not have harsh demands on Japan, basically only two principles: demilitarization and democratization.

　　For five and a half years, MacArthur's actions in Japan have all violated the above two principles. He tore up the Potsdam Proclamation and replaced it with the selfish and self-interested imperialist policies of the United States alone. After the war, American imperialism replaced the position of Japanese imperialism in the Far East. It copied Japan's aggressive policies - the continental policy and the maritime policy, advancing simultaneously from north to south, invading Korea and China's Taiwan, interfering in the internal affairs of Vietnam and the Philippines, and attempting to conquer China as the main goal, rapidly building America's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." But the United States also deeply feels that its own strength is insufficient, so it attempts to use Japan as its aggressive accomplice. MacArthur has become an American Japanese emperor. He protects the remnants of Japanese fascists, supports the forces of Japanese militarism, and oppresses the democratic forces of the Japanese people. Japan has not been demilitarized, but has been re-armed! Japan has not been democratized, but has been fascistized!

　　How many troops does Japan actually have now? To what extent has the United States armed Japan? Before the war, Japan's regular army was only 17 divisions, 230,000 people, and the national police force was only 65,000 people. After the war, Japan does not have the name of a regular army, but it has three types of police: the National Police Force of 30,000 people, which is completely militarized; the Local Autonomous Police Force of 95,000 people; and the National Police Reserve Force, which is a disguised and open Japanese army of 75,000 people. These three types of police alone already constitute an armed force of 200,000 people. In addition, there is a secretly existing underground army, which is the "Development Corps" that the Japanese government's Repatriation Bureau sent repatriated soldiers to various places to cultivate land, and which always maintains a military organization, with a number of more than 120,000 people. What are they developing? Most of them are developing American air force bases - airports. Their leaders are all famous young fascist officers, who still call each other by their old titles of unit commander or officer.

　　In addition to the army, there is also the navy. The Japan Maritime Safety Agency has 300 ships, and is not only actively building new ships, but also actively repairing old ships. The destroyers, cruisers, and battleships that were sleeping on the seabed of Kure Port and other places in Japan have all received orders from the United States. Some have surfaced to report, and some have already turned over in the sea or are about to turn over. After the outbreak of the Korean War, MacArthur further ordered the Yoshida government to expand the personnel of the Japan Maritime Safety Agency from 8,600 to 16,600.

　　Another aspect of arming Japan is turning Japan into an American military base. This refers to military ports, airports, military highways, and auxiliary facilities of various sea and air bases. In short, it is turning Japan into a military fortress. The United States is repairing and expanding military ports in Japan. For example, it has already spent tens of millions of dollars and will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build Yokosuka Naval Base. The United States has retained more than 200 old airports in Japan, some of which have been expanded or are being expanded. It is particularly worth noting that many large new airports have been built, the most famous of which is located in Misawa, Aomori Prefecture, with a runway of 9,500 feet long, which is the main base of the American Pacific Jet Brigade. A series of airports, starting from Hokkaido, Japan, all the way to Kyushu, constitute a military base network facing the Asian continent for offensive purposes.

　　During the Korean War, the United States made full use of the role of Japanese military bases in the American aggression. The headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Air Force is located in Nagoya. Almost all American aircraft bombing peaceful cities in Korea took off from airports in Japan. Japan is not only the nest of the American air force fighting in Korea, but also the home of the American fleet in the Far East, and even the huge supply base of the American army. After the outbreak of the Korean War, American troops were all transported from Japan or through Japan, and the military supplies used by the United States in Korea were also transported from Japan or through Japan. Today, the United States is using Japanese bases and Japanese manpower and material resources to invest in the war of aggression against Korea. Aircraft taking off from Japan have bombed Northeast China. Tomorrow, the United States may use these to launch a major offensive against the Asian continent.

　　The support for Japan's military industry should also be mentioned here. Japan is not a large country, and the people's lives are very difficult. It should and can develop peaceful industries as allowed by the Potsdam Proclamation. The Chinese people welcome Japan to develop a peaceful economy, engage in commerce and trade with Asian countries under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and hope that the Japanese people can live a good and peaceful life. The Potsdam Proclamation offers such a promise to Japan: "We do not intend to enslave the Japanese nation or destroy their country." No one can deprive the Japanese people of their right to survival. However, America's intention in Japan is to destroy its country and enslave its nation. The United States wants Japan to become an American colony and military base. The United States does not allow Japan to have an independent industry. Japan's industry can only be the Far East branch of American arsenals. The United States has revised the Japanese reparations plan five times. This is not to benefit the Japanese people, but to keep the Japanese military industry so that it can serve the American war of aggression. Japan's peaceful industry is being suppressed, and small and medium-sized entrepreneurs are struggling on the brink of bankruptcy. Japan's military factories are accepting orders from the United States and producing munitions for the United States.

　　Many Japanese have been found in the American army fighting in Korea. The United States is using Japanese manpower and material resources to engage in aggression. This is what we cannot tolerate the most, and it is also what the Japanese people oppose. Japanese war criminals are being released one after another, and Japanese patriots are being imprisoned one by one. The Yoshida government is a puppet of the United States. It betrays the country and opposes the people. The Japanese people are living the life of cattle, horses, and slaves. The American war of aggression and the preparation for a new war are rapidly sucking the blood of the Japanese people.

　　But the Japanese people have not lived in vain for five and a half years. They have gained a lot of experience and lessons in real life. In the past five years, all the sinister attempts of the United States towards Japan have been exposed layer by layer to the people of the world. Today, they have been exposed nakedly. The Japanese nation is not surrendering to the United States, and they are resisting. They are organizing strikes and boycotts, holding mass meetings, and demonstrations. On May 30th of last year, a vigorous anti-American movement appeared in Tokyo. Although the American and Japanese reactionaries are implementing ruthless blows against the Japanese people, and all 24 members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party were purged on June 6th, the Japanese people are demanding peace, opposing war, opposing the rearmament of Japan; demanding national independence and people's democracy, opposing the Yoshida cabinet's betrayal of the country and destruction of Japanese democracy; demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty, opposing unilateral peace with the United States; this movement is not only continuing but also unfolding and deepening. As of November 19th of last year, more than six million peace-loving people in Japan had signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal.

　　Based on the above, I, on behalf of the Chinese people, submit the following recommendations to the Council:

　　(1) The Peace Council should condemn the United Nations General Assembly for slandering the People's Republic of China as an aggressor and demand the immediate cancellation of this shameful decision, and accept the peace proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the Korean and Far Eastern issues.

　　(2) The Peace Council recommends to the governments of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the aforementioned four countries to discuss the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, eliminate German militarism, eliminate differences of opinion on the German issue, and seek the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

　　(3) The Peace Council recommends to the governments of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to convene a certain meeting to discuss the Japanese issue and conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan at an early date in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement.

　　(4) Call on the people of the world, mothers, wounded veterans of World War II, and the families of the dead to take all possible means to oppose the American arming of Germany and Japan, and refuse to participate in all actions to arm Germany and Japan.

　　(5) The Council should initiate and assist in convening mass representative meetings of the people of relevant countries in Europe and Asia respectively to launch a movement against the American arming of Germany and the arming of Japan.

　　Finally, we fully agree with and support the proposal to conclude a peace pact between the five major powers—the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. We believe that all 475 million people in China will enthusiastically support this proposal and are willing to fight for its realization. We believe that the sincere cooperation of these five countries will truly eliminate the danger of another war and will guarantee universal peace and security.

　　For the fate of mankind, let me respectfully wish this session of the Council success! Long live peace in Asia, peace in Europe, and peace in the world!

　　郭沫若在和平理事会会议上演说
    同意并支持订立五大国和平公约的建议
    向和平理事会建议：一、谴责联大诬蔑我国，要求联大取消这一决定，并接受我国关于朝鲜及远东问题的和平建议。二、向苏、法、英、美建议，召集四国外长会议，谋求迅速缔结对德和约。三、向中、苏、美、英建议，召开会议，讨论日本问题，早日缔结全面的对日和约。四、号召世界人民采取一切方式，反对美国武装德国和日本。五、发起和帮助分别召集欧亚各国人民的群众代表会议，展开反对美国武装德国和日本的运动。
    【新华社柏林二十四日电】我国出席世界和平理事会代表团团长、世界和平理事会副主席郭沫若，在世界和平理事会二十二日下午会议上发表讲演，全文如下：主席先生，各位理事先生和各位代表先生：
    自从去年十一月第二届世界保卫和平大会以来，世界上的一切演变都更明白地证明了一个真理，就是：全世界人民都要求和平。只有少数人要求战争。
    但是，那少数只要战争、不要和平的帝国主义侵略者，却没有从世界的新的变化吸取应有的教训，他们仍然浸沉在战争的狂热之中。美国帝国主义者侵略了中国的领土台湾和中国的邻邦朝鲜，不但不想结束它的军事冒险，而且企图扩大这个侵略战争，把战争的火焰燃遍全世界。它正在国内无限制地扩大军事预算，加紧发动世界大战的准备；以最急促的步调武装西德和日本，充当其侵略战争的帮凶；把英国、法国和其他资本主义国家紧紧地束缚在它的战争的车轮上。
    中国、朝鲜、苏联、亚洲各国和世界各国的人民都希望早日结束朝鲜战争，求得真正的和平。不久以前，印度、埃及等十二个国家的代表在联合国大会政治委员会上提出了一个和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。中国是历来主张和平解决朝鲜问题的。我国外交部周恩来部长代表我国人民曾于一月十七日致电联合国政治委员会提出了四点和平建议，提议举行包括中国、苏联、英国、美国、法国、印度和埃及的七国会议，谈判结束朝鲜战争、美国武装力量撤出台湾和其他有关远东和平的问题。周恩来部长在一月二十二日答复印度驻中国大使的备忘录时并明白表示：“只要一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退的原则被接受后，并付诸实施，中华人民共和国中央人民政府将负责劝说中国人民志愿部队回到本国。”但美国政府坚持侵略朝鲜与台湾，坚决地反对一切合理的和平建议，它以威胁利诱办法，强迫联合国多数会员国否决了印度等十二国的提案，而通过了美国的诽谤中国“侵略”朝鲜的极端横蛮无理的可耻的反动的提案，这就关闭了以和平谈判解决朝鲜问题之门。美国政府的这种一意孤行，进一步暴露美帝国主义的侵略野心，再一次证明它是中国人民和朝鲜人民的死敌，是世界和平的死敌。
    事情是很明白的，美国政府强迫联合国中多数国家非法通过这个诬蔑中国的提案，其目的不仅在掩饰其对于朝鲜和中国的侵略，并为进一步扩大战争的行动制造借口，这是对于中国、朝鲜、亚洲各国和世界各国的一种新的恫吓和威胁。虽然，多数国家的代表明知道美国提案是个危险的东西，其通过势必鼓励美国的侵略，有把全人类拖入战争的危险，可是联合国中多数国家竟然屈服于美国的意旨之下。这实在是联合国历史上空前可耻的一章。联合国中多数国家，顺从美国政府的意旨违背全世界人民的希望，使联合国不能负起保障人类安全与和平的责任，而赤裸裸地变成了美国政府进行侵略战争的工具。争取世界和平的事业不能不依靠我们各国人民自己的努力。
    不管美国侵略者如何挣扎，也不管朝鲜战争的发展如何曲折，中朝两国人民在全世界人民的同情和支援之下，一定能够取得最后胜利，解放整个朝鲜。现在朝鲜三千万人民正处在水深火热之中，其中许多妇女已经没有丈夫，许多丈夫已经没有妻子，许多孩子已经失去父母，许多父母已经失去儿女，美国侵略者给予朝鲜人民的灾难是既深且重的。我们号召全世界一切爱好和平的人民，共同来援助朝鲜人民。朝鲜人民目前迫切地需要扶伤救死的医药器材，重建和平生活的各种物资。援助朝鲜人民战胜美国侵略者是今天世界人民争取持久和平反对侵略战争的主要任务之一。
    美国政府一方面发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争，同时又在世界范围内积极地准备更大规模的战争。杜鲁门已派遣艾森豪威尔到西欧来，他要在西欧组织一百万以上的军队，特别是要非法的武装西德。杜鲁门又派杜勒斯到东京去活动，阴谋片面对日媾和，主要目的是要武装日本。武装西德与日本是美国新战争准备的重要步骤，西德与日本已变成美国未来新战争的两个车轮，不管美国自身如何拚命扩张军备，必须配上这两个车轮，新战争的列车才可以开动。
    中国人民知道西欧各国人民猛烈反对艾森豪威尔组织北大西洋联军。艾森豪威尔走到那里，那里的爱好和平的人民就群起而攻之。到处高呼：“艾森豪威尔滚蛋！”艾森豪威尔要想复活德国法西斯，但把死人请回人间是不容易的。德国已经变了，德国人民已建立起自己的民主共和国，西德人民已经尝够战争的滋味，知道战争只对少数大资本家有利，而对人民是极大的灾难，因此，他们反对武装西德，决不会甘心替美国当炮灰。我们相信欧洲各国人民完全可以粉碎美国武装西德的阴谋，可以粉碎艾森豪威尔组织北大西洋联军的阴谋。
    我应该向各位先生报告，在东方，美国正在积极武装日本，正和美国在西方武装西德一样。
    战前日本帝国主义是东方一个最残暴最凶恶的侵略国。
    日本帝国主义的侵略政策主要以中国为对象，中国人民的抗日斗争也开始的最早。到了一九三七年，当日本侵略者大举发动侵华战争时，中国人民终于不顾一切不屈不挠地起来进行了八年的抗日战争。在这八年的漫长岁月中，全国人民忍受人所不能忍受的痛苦生活。各位先生们：日本给中国的灾难，从我们祖父一代就开始了。今年五岁以上的中国儿童，都能控诉日本给我们的祸害。无数的城市和乡村毁于日寇的炮火，无数的幸福家庭被消灭了。在八年的抗日战争中，据不完全的估计，中国全国损失生命一千万以上，公私财物损失约值五百亿美元。至于一九三七年以前的损失，及许多间接的损害，那就难以统计了。但是中国人民不是只会悲叹的，我们更善于与压迫和奴役我们的敌人斗争。中国的优秀儿女们踏上了战场，不惜抛头颅洒热血，前仆后继，战斗到底。终于取得了对日战争的最后胜利。
    侵略亚洲的旧日本——日本帝国——于一九四五年八月死去了。当时同盟国，中国、苏联、美国和英国，委托麦克阿瑟去管制投降后的日本。管制日本的目的，就是说，麦克阿瑟的任务，在于执行日本无条件投降的条款，即实现波茨坦公告。这个波茨坦公告，是中国、美国、英国签字的，苏联参加的，又是日本投降时无条件地接受的。这个波茨坦公告，是牺牲千万以上的生命，耗费八年的战争时间，世界人民用血与泪写成的。从一九四五年八月到今天，五年半如一日，我们对日本的态度、政策、方针只有一个：实现波茨坦公告！我们对于受同盟国委托管制日本的麦克阿瑟，也只有一个要求：实现波茨坦公告！
    波茨坦公告对日本没有苛刻的要求，基本上只有两个原则：非军事化和民主化。
    五年半来，麦克阿瑟在日本的行动，全部违背上述两原则，他把波茨坦公告撕毁，代以美国一国的自私自利的帝国主义政策。美国帝国主义战后在远东代替了日本帝国主义的地位，它抄袭日本的侵略政策——大陆政策和海洋政策南北同时并进，侵略朝鲜和中国的台湾，干涉越南和菲律宾的内政，并欲以征服中国为主，急速建设美国的“大东亚共荣圈”。但美国又深感自己的力量不足，于是便企图以日本作为它的侵略帮凶。麦克阿瑟成了美国籍的日本天皇，他保护日本法西斯残余，扶植日本军国主义的力量，压迫日本人民民主势力。日本没有被非军事化，反而被再武装起来了！日本没有被民主化，反而法西斯化了！
    现在日本到底已有多少军队呢？美国武装日本已到达什么程度呢？战前日本常备军不过十七个师二十三万人，全国警察不过六万五千人。战后日本没有常备军之名，但有三种警察：国家警察三万人，完全军队化；地方自治警察九万五千人；国家警察预备队，这是一支变相的、公开的日本陆军，七万五千名。仅此三种警察，就已经是二十万的武装队伍了。此外，还有一支秘密存在的地下军，是日本政府复员局把复员军人送到各地开垦的，始终保持军事组织的“开拓团”，人数在十二万以上。他们开拓什么呢？大部分在开拓美国的空军基地——飞机场。他们的领导者，都是有名的年青的法西斯将校，依然称呼某某部队长，某某长官。
    除陆军而外，还有海军。日本海上保安厅拥有舰艇三百艘，不仅积极在建造新舰，还积极在修理旧舰。熟睡在吴港和其他地方日本海底的驱逐舰啦，巡洋舰啦，主力舰啦，都已奉到美国的命令，有的浮出海面报到，有的已在海里翻身或正要翻身。朝鲜战争发生以后，麦克阿瑟更下令吉田政府，将日本海上保安厅人员由八千六百名扩充到一万六千六百名。
    武装日本的另一方面，是把日本变成美国的军事基地。这里指的是包括军港、飞机场、军事公路及各种海空基地的附属设备，总之，把日本变成一个军事堡垒。美国在日本修理和扩张军港，譬如它已花数千万美元，还要再花数亿美元用以建设横须贺军港。美国在日本保留二百余个旧飞机场，其中有些飞机场已予扩张或正在扩张；特别值得注意的是建设了许多大的新的飞机场，其中最著名的一个在青森县三泽地方，跑道全长九千五百英尺，乃是美国太平洋喷气机大队的大本营。一连串的飞机场，由日本北海道开始，一直到九州为止，构成一个面对亚洲大陆的进攻的军事基地网。
    在朝鲜战争中，美国曾尽量发挥了日本军事基地对美国侵略事业的作用。美国第五航空队司令部设在名古屋，所有轰炸朝鲜和平城市的美国飞机，几乎全部从日本的飞机场起飞。日本不但是美国对朝鲜作战的空军的巢穴，又是美国在远东的舰队之家，同时更是美国陆军的巨大兵站。朝鲜战争发生后，美国陆军都是在日本或经由日本运出，美国在朝鲜使用的军需也都是在日本或经由日本运出的。今天美国利用日本的基地，日本的人力物力，投在侵略朝鲜的战争上；从日本起飞的飞机，已轰炸了中国的东北。明天，美国就将可能利用这些大举进攻亚洲大陆。
    关于扶植日本军事工业，也应在这里提一提。日本土地不大，人民生活很苦，它应该而且可能如波茨坦公告所允许的发展和平工业。中国人民欢迎日本发展和平经济，与亚洲各国在平等互利原则下通商贸易，并希望日本人民能够过美好的和平的生活。波茨坦公告对日本提供这样的诺言：“我们无意奴役日本的民族或毁灭其国家。”没有人能剥夺日本人民生存的权利。但是美国在日本的企图，是既灭亡其国家，又奴役其民族。美国要日本成为美国的殖民地和军事基地。美国不允许日本有独立的工业，日本工业只能是美国兵工厂的远东分厂。美国五次修改日本赔偿计划，这不是嘉惠日本人民，而是把日本军事工业留下来，使之为美国侵略战争服务。日本的和平工业受着压迫，中小企业家挣扎在破产的边缘。日本的军需工厂，接受美国的订货，为美国生产军火。
    在朝鲜作战的美国军队中，已发现很多日本人。美国利用日本的人力物力，以从事侵略。这是我们所最不能容忍的，也是日本人民所反对的。日本战犯一批一批被释放出来，日本的爱国人士一个一个被关进牢狱。吉田政府是美国的傀儡，它卖国，它反人民。日本人民在过着牛马奴隶的生活，美国所进行的侵略战争及准备新战争，在疾速地吸吮着日本人民的血。
    但是五年半来，日本人民并没有白过，他们实在际生活中获得了不少的经验教训，五年来，美国对日的一切阴险企图，层层为世界人民所暴露，到今天，已暴露得赤裸裸了。日本民族对美国是不屈服的，他们正在进行反抗。他们组织罢工、罢课，举行群众大会、游行示威。去年五月三十日在东京就出现一个轰轰烈烈的反美运动。虽然美日反动派对日本人民实行无情的打击，六月六日日本共产党二十四名中央委员全部被整肃，但是日本人民要求和平，反对战争，反对日本再武装；要求国家独立与人民民主，反对吉田内阁的卖国及摧残日本民主，要求缔结全面和约，反对与美国片面媾和；这运动不但在持续而且在展开与深入。截至去年十一月十九日，日本的和平人士，在斯德哥尔摩和平书上签名者已在六百万名以上。
    总上所说，我代表中国人民向理事会提出下列建议：
    （一）和平理事会对于联合国大会诬蔑中华人民共和国为侵略者加以谴责，并要求立即取消这一可耻的决定，而接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府关于朝鲜及远东问题的和平建议。
    （二）和平理事会向苏联、法国、英国、美国政府建议，召集上述四国外长会议，讨论履行波茨坦协定，肃清德国军国主义，消除在德国问题上的分歧意见，谋求迅速缔结对德和约。
    （三）和平理事会向中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国政府建议，召开一定的会议，讨论日本问题，依据开罗宣言，波茨坦公告和雅尔达协议，早日缔结全面的对日和约。
    （四）号召世界人民，母亲们，二次大战伤兵们及死亡者的家属们，采取可能的一切方式，反对美国武装德国和日本，拒绝参与武装德国和日本的一切行动。
    （五）理事会发起和帮助分别召集欧洲和亚洲有关各国人民的群众代表会议，展开反对美国武装德国和武装日本的运动。
    最后，我们完全同意并支持订立五大国——中华人民共和国、苏联、美国、英国、法国——和平公约的建议。我们相信，全中国四亿七千五百万人民定会热烈拥护这一建议，并愿为其实现而奋斗。我们相信，这五国的真诚合作将真正消除另一次战争的危险，并将保证普遍的和平与安全。
    为了人类的命运，让我敬祝本届理事会成功！亚洲和平，欧洲和平，全世界和平万岁！
