Japanese imperialists are our mortal enemies, but the Japanese people have always been friendly to us. They commonly wear clothes from the Sui and Tang dynasties, eat rice and wheat transplanted from the mainland, use Chinese characters, Buddhist monks recite Chinese scriptures, and Christian adherents use Bibles translated from Chinese versions.

In modern times, when Western capitalist imperialists were searching for colonies everywhere overseas, our old China had a greater colonial value than Japan, and we served as a shield for Japan. Therefore, Japan was less hindered by economic aggressors and modernized earlier than us.

Once Japan modernized, its power holders immediately became infected with the acute symptoms of imperialism and became the vanguard of aggression. Its spearhead was directed at us. It sucked the blood of the Chinese people to fatten its imperialism, and at the same time acted as a bodyguard for Western imperialist countries, hindering our modernization. For fifty years, the blood debt of Japanese imperialists to the Chinese people has been incalculable. Just take the large-scale military aggression from 1937 to 1945 as an example: we sacrificed more than ten million people and lost property worth 50 billion US dollars. The so-called "Three Alls Policy" of kill all, loot all, and burn all was a major invention of Japanese imperialists in our Chinese territory. They used all kinds of weapons, bacteria, poison gas, nothing was spared. Only the atomic bomb, Japan had not yet invented it, but it allowed US imperialists to advance it two steps ahead.

But we have no hatred for the Japanese people. We know that the Japanese people are also oppressed and exploited by the Japanese ruling class. The Japanese people also need freedom, peace, and happiness, and also need a genuine democratic system.

In 1945, Japanese imperialists were defeated and surrendered. According to the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Proclamation, Japan must be disarmed, the roots of militarism must be eliminated, and it must be thoroughly democratized. This is also the demand of the Japanese people. For the happiness of the Japanese people, for the happiness of the Asian people, and for the happiness of the people all over the world, we must do this.

But after Japanese imperialists surrendered, US imperialism completely replaced it. For five years, MacArthur's measures in Japan have completely followed the old path of the Japanese rulers, and have even intensified. As US imperialists' ambition to dominate the world becomes more and more blatant, its policy towards Japan has become more and more reactionary, completely abandoning the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Proclamation. It had long secretly preserved Japan's armed forces, and recently it has been blatantly expanding them. It uses Japan as a base of aggression in the war of aggression against Korea, and directly uses Japanese manpower and material resources. It has recently taken obvious steps to prepare to conclude a separate peace treaty with the reactionary Japanese government, bypassing China and the Soviet Union.

In fact, we don't need to say much. We Chinese people have always opposed all of MacArthur's reactionary measures. We Chinese people will resist US imperialists' aggressive acts to the end.

China fought the longest and sacrificed the most against the aggression of Japanese imperialists. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in defeating Japan as an allied nation. A peace treaty with Japan without the participation of China and the Soviet Union is just a new form of aggression by US imperialism "colluding with Japan in acts of aggression." We Chinese people are resolutely opposed to this, and we believe that the Japanese people will also resolutely oppose it.

The Japanese people are our friends, the Japanese reactionary rulers who oppress the Japanese people - the remnants of militarism are our mortal enemies, and the US imperialists who collude with our mortal enemies are our double mortal enemies. It is as clear as fire that US imperialists are today intent on being enemies with us Chinese people, intent on expanding aggression in Asia, just as they are rearming West Germany in Europe as its pawn, and rearming the remnants of Japanese militarism in the East, intending to stir up a world war to satisfy its ambition to dominate the world.

The people of all China have stood up. We hope that the people of all Japan, the people of all Asia, and the people of the whole world will stand up together, eliminate the aggressive ambitions of US imperialism, stop any form of aggression, and strengthen the struggle to defend world peace and security!

### 制止美帝和日本在侵略行为上的勾结

　　制止美帝和日本在侵略行为上的勾结
    日本帝国主义者和我们是死敌，但日本人民和我们却向来是友好的。他们普通穿的是隋唐时代的服装，吃的是由大陆移植过去的米麦，用的是汉字，佛教徒念汉文经典，基督教徒用的圣经也是从汉文译本翻译过去的。
    到了近代，西方资本帝国主义，在海外四处找殖民地的时候，是我们旧中国的殖民价值比日本的大，我们替日本做了挡箭牌。因此，日本便比较少受到经济侵略者的阻挠，而比我们早一步近代化了。
    日本一近代化，它的政权掌握者便立即感染上了帝国主义的急性症，成为了侵略的急先锋。它的矛头指向着我们。它吸吮着我们中国人民的血来养肥了它的帝国主义，同时又替西方帝国主义国家做保鑣，阻挠了我们的近代化。五十年来，日本帝国主义者和我们中国人民的一篇血债是算不清的。单拿一九三七年至一九四五年八年间的大规模的军事侵略来说，我们牺牲了一千万人以上，损失了价值五百亿美元的财产。杀光、抢光、烧光的所谓“三光政策”，便是日本帝国主义者在我们中国境内的大发明。武器是什么都使用尽了的，细菌、毒气，无所不用。就只有原子弹，在日本还没有发明，它却让美帝国主义者先晋了它两个吧了。
    但我们对日本人民并没有仇恨，我们知道日本人民同样受日本统治阶级的压迫和剥削。日本人民同样需要自由和平的幸福，同样需要真正的民主制度。
    一九四五年，日本帝国主义者被打败了，投降了。根据雅尔塔协定和波茨坦公告，日本必须解除武装，消灭军国主义的根蒂，彻底民主化。这同时也是日本人民的要求。为了日本人民的幸福，为了亚洲人民的幸福，为了全世界人民的幸福，我们必须这样做。
    但在日本帝国主义投降了之后，美国帝国主义却完全代替了它。五年以来，麦克阿瑟在日本的措施，完全蹈袭了日本统治者的旧辙，而且变本加厉。美帝国主义者随着它独霸世界的野心日趋露骨，它的对日政策也就日趋反动，完全背弃了雅尔塔协定和波茨坦公告。它早就把日本的武装力量偷偷摸摸的保存了下来，最近更明目张胆地在加以扩大。在侵略朝鲜的战争中使用日本为侵略基地，而且直接使用着日本的人力物力。它最近更采取了明显的步骤，准备撇开中国和苏联、与日本反动政府单独缔结和约了。
    事实上我们是用不着多说话。麦克阿瑟的一切反动措施，我们中国人民向来是反对的。美帝国主义的侵略行为，我们中国人民是要抵抗到底的。
    我们中国对于日本帝国主义者的侵略，作战最久，牺牲最大。苏联在打败日本上则是起了决定性作用的盟邦。没有中国和苏联参加的对日和约，那只是美帝国主义“在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的”一种新的侵略形式而已。这，我们中国人民是坚决反对的，就是日本人民我们相信也会坚决反对。
    日本人民是我们的朋友，压迫日本人民的日本反动统治者——军国主义的残余分子是我们的死对头，和我们的死对头相勾结的美国帝国主义者是我们的双料死对头。美帝国主义者今天存心和我们中国人民为敌，存心扩大在亚洲的侵略，就和在欧洲重新武装西德作为它的选手一样，在东方重新武装日本的军国主义残余分子，存心卷起世界战争，以满足它独霸世界的野心，这已经是明如观火的事。
    我们全中国的人民是站起来了。我们希望全日本的人民、全亚洲的人民、全世界的人民一同站起来，消灭美帝国主义的侵略野心，制止任何形式的侵略，为保卫世界的和平与安全而加强奋斗！
