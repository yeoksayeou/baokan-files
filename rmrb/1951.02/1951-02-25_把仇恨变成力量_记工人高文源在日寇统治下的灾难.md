　　Turning Hatred into Strength
    ——Remembering Worker Gao Wenyuan's Disaster Under Japanese Imperialist Rule
    Jin Feng

    This is inside the fitter's workshop at the Beijing Machine Factory.

    In an instant, the roar of the machines stopped. The drive belts turned slower and slower, finally coming to a standstill. In the fitter's workshop, the sound of splashing water and washing hands echoed. Steamed buns emitted the aroma of scorching from the stove, and flatbreads and dumplings released waves of oily fragrance. A young worker cheerfully shouted, "I'm eating meat today, who wants some?"

    Gao Wenyuan walked over smiling, and greeted me, "Let's talk!" I noticed he wasn't eating much and was a little surprised. When I asked, he said in a low voice, grinding his teeth, "It's that damn sickness I got from gnawing on bricks back then!" Only then did I realize that this twenty-six-year-old young man had a sallow complexion and looked very thin in his padded clothes.

    Gao Wenyuan spoke slowly, pausing frequently, recalling some of the details from that time.

    The waning moon of October shone on the rows of machine guns squatting on the surrounding walls. The bloody stench from hundreds of corpses, victims of machine-gun fire, wafted from beneath the walls. Inside the walls, the plaza was filled with a dense mass of 30,000 people. They were residents of Renqiu, Gaoyang and other counties along the Daqing River, captured by the Japanese invaders during a brutal mopping-up operation in the Pingjin-Bao triangular area. From Gao Wenyuan's village alone – Dagouge Village, Renqiu – 3,000 people had been seized.

    Gao Wenyuan lay on the ground, first feeling like his legs, then his whole body, were being pricked by millions of tiny needles. Unable to bear it, he tried to move the head resting on his leg; only to hear the sound of Japanese jackboots growing louder and closer. With a snap, the leather whip lashed onto his body like a poisonous snake, and his hands instinctively covered his head. At this moment, the body of another person he was using as a pillow also shuddered violently, and the whip fell over there.

    This stopped the numbness all over his body. Gao Wenyuan opened his eyes and looked at the high platform in the center of the field, vividly recalling the treacherous smiles of the two Japanese military police captains, Yoshizaki and Arima, from earlier in the day.

    The interpreter, like a living corpse, stood on the high platform, imitating the tone of his masters and viciously shouting, "The Communist Party of Jizhong cannot be eliminated! The Communist Party is the fish, and the people are the water. Today, we are going to drain the water to get the fish!" Someone in the crowd of 30,000 cleared their throat, and coughing resounded throughout the field. The Japanese devils and the interpreter conferred for a moment, and the interpreter shouted, "No moving, no coughing; speaking will be shot, coughing will be shot, looking back will be shot, looking down will also be shot!"

    The Japanese captain, speaking fluent Chinese, said, "Are you communists, village cadres? It doesn't matter if you tell us." He tempted them like an old fox. The crowd was as if dead, each person firmly saying to themselves, "I will not say a single word!"

    The fox face instantly turned into a wolf-dog face, viciously howling, "If you don't speak, the machine guns are waiting!" A dozen minutes passed, and the sound of machine gun bullets being loaded on the wall was clearly heard. Everyone once again said to themselves, "I will not speak." The machine guns fired, and hundreds of people fell. Some people cried, some screamed. Still, no one uttered a word.

    Thinking of this, Gao Wenyuan sneered, "Shoot, kill, do you think you can make us say half a word? Thirty thousand people, not one made a sound, all tough bones!"

    When the night frost covered all 30,000 people with a white layer, the dog-like voices of the Japanese devils and the interpreter rang out again.

    This time it was a collective interrogation.

    The Japanese invaders took Gao Wenyuan and a group of two or three hundred people, in front of them were rows of tables and seventy or eighty earthen pits. Again, the opening remarks of "looking back, winking, and coughing will be shot," and another set of devilish questions about who were the communists and village cadres. The response was still silence, a stubborn silent resistance!

    At this time, Wang Ma, a thirty-year-old from Gao Wenyuan's village, suddenly couldn't help coughing. Immediately, a devil pounced on him like a dog, and four or five people were taken out, stripped naked, and made to kneel in front of the pits. Yoshizaki, with a treacherous smile, asked with a dry laugh, "Are they communists and village cadres? If they are, you can guarantee them, it doesn't matter." No one spoke, still that stubborn silent resistance!

    "My knife is crying straight!" Yoshizaki roared like a mad dog, drew out his Japanese saber, and slashed directly at the kneeling people. Bloody heads were placed on the table, he threatened and cursed. Still, he didn't get half a word.

    On the third day, the seventy or eighty earthen pits were already filled with people. Fang Youzhi, an eighteen-year-old farmhand from Gao Wenyuan's village, was also buried inside.

    Collective interrogation yielded no results, so individual interrogation began. Gao Wenyuan was seized in the first batch.

    In a small room, Yoshizaki and Arima repeatedly asked, "Are you a communist? What work do you do in the village? How many Eighth Route Army soldiers are there? When did they come, when did they leave? Where are the tunnels? Where is the grain buried? How many communists are there in the village, what work are they doing?" Having seen them bury people alive, Gao Wenyuan had already hardened his heart and didn't even raise his eyelids when listening to these questions. He was silent like a rock.

    His head and hands were bound with electric wires, and electricity coursed through his body. He fainted and woke up to find himself thrown into the courtyard.

    For six days, there was no food or drink. People began to gnaw on tree bark, and urinated into their cotton coats to wring out the liquid to drink. At night, it rained lightly, and people opened their mouths to swallow drop by drop. The bricks on the ground were also gnawed, just to have something to chew on in their mouths. Women were already dying.

    Only on the sixth day, each person was given a small cornbread roll the size of an ink bottle, and a dozen buckets of water were brought, one small dish per person, and it was gone with a lick.

    More and more people were dying, corpses lying on the bodies of the living, the heads of the living resting on the corpses.

    Gao Wenyuan saw Yang Si from his village stabbed to death with a bayonet, just because he moved his head away from the corpse. He couldn't bear it and had just sat up when the military police's big leather boots kicked him straight in the face. He was stripped naked and tied to a wooden stake. Two women and three men were also tied with him, and in front of them stood a group of wolves with white, jagged teeth and blood-red tongues. That Yoshizaki with a wolf-dog face stood there grinning. Gao Wenyuan glanced at him, and saw him just point his mouth, and a dog went straight for the man next to him. His chest was torn open, his liver pulled out, the flesh on his body torn off, and his face bitten until only bones remained, his eyes still turning. Gao Wenyuan fainted.

    He woke up to see his mother's eyes, full of worry and joy. He thought he was dreaming, sighed softly, and closed his eyes again. But he heard his younger sister clearly calling him "Brother." He couldn't help but open his eyes again, and in front of him were familiar walls and bed, his mother stood in front of his bed holding a bowl. He put his finger in his mouth and bit it painfully, and asked in panic, "Am I not dreaming?" His mother was so happy that she didn't have time to wipe away her tears and told him: on the twelfth day after they were captured, several thousand people had died from starvation and beatings. A regiment of the Jidong Military Region fought for a day and a night to rescue them, and a civilian from another village had carried him back on a stretcher. He had been unconscious for three days after arriving home, and had just woken up. As he listened, Gao Wenyuan shed tears.

    "I cried," Gao Wenyuan said somewhat embarrassed, "because I finally made it through this ordeal. My life hung by a thread, I didn't reveal the Eighth Route Army, the Communist Party, or the buried grain. All thirty thousand of us were of one mind, and no one bowed their heads to the devils. But several thousand people had already died in that desolate field in Renqiu, and they will never see their parents and siblings again. I cried also because the Eighth Route Army sacrificed so many lives to rescue us!"

    He was silent for a while, and said calmly, "I saw in the newspapers the crimes of the American imperialists in Korea, which are exactly the same as what the Japanese devils did in China. Now, the blood debt the Japanese devils owe us has not yet been repaid, and the American bandits actually want to equip them to invade us again. This is impossible." As soon as he finished speaking, he stood up and walked straight to the workshop. At this moment, I heard the machines roaring.

    I followed him into the workshop, watching him quickly open the cabinet, take out his tools, and focus his attention on the water pump machine, using a ruler to draw lines, as if completely forgetting my existence. I remembered that he had told me that they were carrying out a patriotic production competition, and their scribing team had already completed the task four days ahead of schedule in the first twenty days. I no longer disturbed him, quietly watching this busy workshop, watching these many ordinary workers. I knew how much hatred for imperialism was contained in them! Today, this hatred is being transformed into strength, into the economic strength of the new China, preparing to drive the American imperialists out of Asia once and for all!

　　把仇恨变成力量
    ——记工人高文源在日寇统治下的灾难
    金凤
    这是在北京机器厂钳工场里。
    一霎那，机器的轰响停止了。轮带愈转愈慢，终于静止不动。钳工场里，响着一片泼水洗手的声音。馒头在火炉上发出烤焦的香味，烙饼和包子散发出阵阵的油香气息。一个青年工人快活地高叫着：“我今天吃肉，谁来吃？”
    高文源笑着走过来，一面招呼着我：“咱们来谈谈吧！”我见他吃得不多，有点奇怪。问起来时，他低声地咬着牙说：“就是那年啃砖头闹下的鬼病！”我这才发现这个二十六岁的青年小伙子，有着一张蜡黄的脸孔，穿着棉衣服的身材看上去也很瘦弱。
    高文源说得很慢，时时停顿着，回想着当时的一些情节。
    十月的下弦月，照着围墙上一架架蹲着的机关枪，围墙下几百具被机枪扫射的尸体飘过来血腥的气味，围墙里的广场上躺着黑压压三万人。他们是日寇在平津保三角地带残酷扫荡中抓来的大清河畔任邱、高阳等县的老百姓。仅仅高文源的一村——任邱大苟各庄，就被抓来了三千人。
    高文源躺在地下，先是觉得腿上、后来觉得全身好像有千万根小针在扎着。他忍受不住，想挪动一下搁在他腿上的脑袋；只听得日本人的皮靴声愈响愈近。拍的一下，皮鞭像毒蛇一样卷上了他的身体，他的手本能地捧住了头。这时，他枕着的别一个人的身体也猛然抖动了一下，皮鞭落到那边去了。
    这样一来，全身的酸麻停止了。高文源睁眼望着场中的高台，面前活现出白天那两个日本宪兵队长善琦和有马那奸诈的笑容。
    活死人一样的翻译站在高台上学着他主子的腔调恶狠狠叫着“冀中共产党没办法消灭！共产党是鱼，老百姓是水。今天要淘水拿鱼！”三万人的人群中不知谁干咳了一声，全场的咳嗽声响成一片。日本鬼子和翻译叽咕一下，翻译就高叫着：“不许动、不许咳嗽；说话要枪毙，咳嗽要枪毙，回头要枪毙，低头也要枪毙！”
    日本队长说着一口流利的中国话：“你们是不是共产党、村干部？说出来没有关系。”他像老狐狸一样地诱惑着。台下像死了的一般，每个人心里都在坚决向自己说“决不说半个字！”
    狐狸脸一下变成了狼狗脸，凶恶地嘶叫着：“不说，机关枪等着！”十几分钟过去了，听得清楚围墙上机枪子弹上膛的声音，每一个人再一次向自己说“决不说”。机枪响了，几百个人倒下去了。有人流泪，有人尖叫。仍然，没有一个人吐出一句话来。
    想到这里，高文源冷笑起来：“打吧、杀吧，要我们讲出半句话来，你难道办得到吗？三万人，就没有一个啃一声，都是硬骨头啊！”
    等到夜间的霜把这三万人都盖上白白的一层，日本鬼子和翻译的狗叫似的声音又呱啦啦响开了。
    这次是集体审讯。
    日寇把高文源这一溜二三百人提了去，在他们前面是一溜桌子和七八十个土坑。又是一套“回头、?眼、咳嗽要枪毙”的开场白，又是一套逼问谁是共产党和村干部的鬼话。回答的仍然是一片沉默，这是倔强无声的反抗！
    这时，高文源同村的三十多岁的王麻突然忍不住咳嗽了一下。立刻，鬼子像一条狗样扑到他身上，同时有四五个人都被提了出来，脱光了衣服跪在坑前。露着奸诈笑容的善琦又干笑着问：“他们是不是共产党和村干部？如果是，许可保他，没关系。”谁也不言语，还是那倔强无声的反抗！
    “我的刀屈得直哭！”善琦像只疯狗样狂叫起来，拔出东洋马刀直向跪着的人砍去。血淋淋的人头搁在桌上，他威吓着，咒骂着。仍然得不到半句话。
    第三天，七八十个土坑已经填满了人。高文源同村的十八岁长工方有志也埋在里面了。
    集体审讯没有结果，进行个别审问。第一批就把高文源抓去。
    在一间小屋子里，善琦和有马一连声地追问：“你是不是共产党，你在村里担任什么工作？八路军有多少，那天来，那天走？地道在那里？粮食埋在那里？村里共产党有多少，搞那些工作？”已经看过他们活埋人的高文源早就把心横上了，听着这些问话连眼皮也没有抬一下。岩石似地沉默。
    他的头和手被电线缚上，电流通过全身，他晕倒了，醒过来已经被摔到院子里。
    六天，没有吃，没有喝。人开始啃树皮，把尿撒到棉袄里拧着喝。夜里下着小雨，人张着嘴一点一滴地咽下去。地上的砖头也啃起来，为的是嘴里有些东西嚼嚼。女人们已经在死去了。
    只在第六天，一人给了一个墨水瓶一样的小窝窝头，抬来十几桶水，一人一小碟，用舌头舐一下就光了。
    死的人多起来，尸首躺在活人的身体上，活人的脑袋搁在尸首上。
    高文源看到同村的杨四活生生被刺刀挑死，只为他把自己的头移开了死人的尸体。他忍不住了，刚坐了起来，宪兵的大皮靴一直踢在他脸上。他被剥光了衣服绑在木桩上。两个女的和三个男的也和他绑在一起，前面立着一群露出白巉巉牙齿和血红舌头的狼狗。那个有着一张狼狗脸孔的善琦又站在那里狞笑。高文源望了他一眼，只见他把嘴一努，一条狗直向他身边那个男人身上扑去。胸膛撕开了，肝脏拉出来了，身上的肉撕下来了，脸上咬得只剩了骨头，眼睛还在转动。高文源昏了过去。
    他醒过来，一眼看到母亲的又忧愁又喜欢的眼光。他想他是做梦了，轻轻叹口气又闭上了眼睛。却又听到妹妹清清楚楚地叫着他“哥哥”。他不由得又睁开眼来，面前是熟识的墙和床，母亲捧着碗站在他床前。他把手指伸到嘴里咬痛了，惊慌地问：“我不是做梦？”母亲高兴得来不及擦眼泪就告诉他：在他们被抓去的第十二天，连饿死带打死的人已有好几千。冀东军分区一个团打了一天一夜把他们抢救了出来，他是别村的民伕用担架把他送回来的。到家三天不知人事，现在才醒过来。听着听着，高文源落下了眼泪。
    “我哭了”，高文源有些不好意思地说：“是因为我总算挺过了这一关。我的命悬在刀口上，我没有说出八路军、共产党和埋的粮食。我们抓去的三万人也都一条心，没有一个向鬼子低头。但是已经有好几千人死在任邱那荒场上，他们再也见不到他们的父母姊妹了。我哭了，也因为八路军为了救出我们，又不知牺牲了多少生命！”
    他又沉默了一会，沉静地说：“我看到报上登的美帝在朝鲜的罪行，简直完全和日本鬼子在中国干的一样。如今，日本鬼子欠咱们的血债还没有偿还，美国强盗竟又想装备它再来侵略咱们。这是办不到的。”话音一落，他站起身来直向工场走去。这时我才听到机器已经轰隆隆响开了。
    我跟他走进工场，看着他迅速打开柜子，取出工具，专心一志就在那水泵机器上用尺比划着划起线来，彷佛完全忘记了我的存在。我记起他告诉过我，他们正在开展爱国主义生产竞赛，他们划线组在前二十天已经提前四天完成任务。我不再惊动他，静静望着这个紧张的工房，望着这许多普通工人。我知道，在他们身上，蕴藏着多少对帝国主义的仇恨呵！今天，这仇恨正在变成力量，变成新中国的经济力量，准备着，把美帝国主义最后赶出亚洲去！
