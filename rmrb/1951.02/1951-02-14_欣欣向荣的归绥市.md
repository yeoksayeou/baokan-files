　　Thriving Gui Sui City
　　Li Xian
    "Gui Sui City has changed!" This is the common conclusion reached by more than 135,000 residents when recalling the achievements of the past year. Indeed, the initial impression of Gui Sui City was: desolate, chaotic, dirty, and dark. Large businesses had their doors half-closed, small stalls were everywhere on the streets, and alleys were full of human and animal waste. At night, it was dimly lit, with only a little more than one hundred street lights in the entire city. This was the scene after the glorious "September 19th" uprising in Suiyuan in 1949, before the People's Government entered the city.

    In just one year, the situation has fundamentally changed. On January 2nd, the "Anniversary Exhibition of the Establishment of the Municipal People's Government" was held at the Gui Sui City People's Cultural Center. The photos and charts displayed vividly and specifically illustrated this change.

    Under the leadership and education of the Party, the workers' class consciousness has been unprecedentedly raised, their enthusiasm for production is high, and technology is constantly improving. The Telecommunications Bureau used to have as many as 120 accidents per day, but now it has been reduced to 20. The Gui Sui Depot of the Beijing-Baotou Railway Bureau successfully completed a 200,000-kilometer accident-free campaign on December 14 last year, and will strive to launch a 500,000-kilometer accident-free campaign. The coal consumption rate of the electric flour mill has been reduced again. The workers spent 1950 in this kind of combat life, and a large number of activists and model workers emerged from the production movement.

    New factories are being established. The Suixing Construction Company has been established, the Xinsheng Sack Factory has officially started operations, and the licorice factory, which was completely destroyed by the Kuomintang, has been rebuilt on the ruins (licorice is a famous local product of Suiyuan, with an annual output of up to 10 million catties), producing more than one hundred catties of licorice essence (which can be used for candy, soy sauce, and western medicine) per day.

    Although the Gui Sui City's industry and commerce once experienced a period of recession after the unification of finance and economy in March last year, it has gradually recovered and developed after the People's Government adjusted industry and commerce. At that time, the People's Government carried out the following work: (1) Appropriately and rationally adjusted industrial and commercial taxes, and completely abolished the 34 kinds of miscellaneous taxes and levies of the Kuomintang reactionaries (including unrated apportionments), relatively reducing the burden on the people. (2) The National Bank issued loans to solve the problem of insufficient funds for industrialists and businessmen. (3) Implemented and carried out the policy of benefiting both labor and capital. Sixteen industries, such as leather tanning and papermaking, were organized in a focused manner, and labor-capital consultation meetings were established, of which ten industries have signed labor-capital collective contracts, and adjusted the wholesale and retail price differences to make private businesses profitable. (4) The People's Government and state-owned enterprises supported the production of private enterprises by planning to adopt processing, ordering, purchasing, and sales methods. The processed white flour and naked oat flour alone reached 830,000 catties. (5) Connecting urban and rural relations and strengthening internal and external exchanges: The city's cooperative headquarters established a farmer's hostel, which greatly facilitated farmers' exchange of materials in the city. The city's Hui production and supply cooperative organized 150 camel drivers and 927 camels to supplement the lack of transportation tools. And developed trade to Inner Mongolia, Gansu and other places. Therefore, under the leadership of the People's Government, Gui Sui City's industry and commerce are booming and showing a thriving atmosphere; now, the number of commercial households has increased from 1,022 before liberation to 1,290, and the number of industrial households has increased from 511 to 851.

    The public security and judicial organs carried out the tasks of eliminating bandits and special agents, stabilizing social order, and safeguarding production and construction. Suiyuan is a remote area and the last area liberated in North China, so there are more hidden bandits and special agents. Over the past year, chief bandit and special agent Zhang Huazhan (staff officer and commander of the 7th Route Army of the pseudo-North China People's United Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army) and other important criminals have been captured and sentenced to death. Public security cases reached 232 in April last year, and decreased to 84 in November. At the same time, a labor brigade was established to concentrate a large number of opium addicts, petty thieves, and unemployed people for labor reform. After the reform, they changed from being dying and depressed to becoming new people with rosy faces and love for labor.

    Among the 2,536 people in the labor brigade, 2,251 were originally addicted to drugs. The reason why opium addiction is so harmful in Suiyuan is closely related to imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. As early as the Guangxu period, opium was imported into Suiyuan by imperialist elements. During the Kuomintang rule, not only was opium cultivation open and legal, but the reactionary government also collected huge opium taxes, and even distributed opium to households, extorting people's wealth in every possible way. Those who were ruined and sold their wives and children due to drug addiction were everywhere; even children in their teens were addicted to drugs for several years. After the establishment of the People's Government, it vigorously banned opium. In the past year, through labor brigades, small-scale drug rehabilitation centers, and home detoxification methods, more than 4,000 people have quit their addictions, accounting for an estimated 54 percent of the total number of opium addicts. On December 17 last year, the government also burned all the confiscated opium, raw opium, and fake raw opium. The government's determination to ban opium touched the hearts of the vast majority of citizens.

    In order to implement the provisions of Article 40 of the Common Program, Gui Sui City convened two sessions of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles on April 24 and August 27 last year. This was an earth-shaking event, and the people became masters for the first time. All 14 resolutions of the first People's Representatives Conference of all circles have been implemented. Most of the 34 resolutions of the second People's Representatives Conference of all circles have also been implemented. The Baojia system, which used to oppress the people, has been overthrown, and the people themselves elected the Li and group leaders to do things for everyone.

    The student movement has also developed. Under the leadership of the Party and the League, through political study, youth lectures, and campus life, students' awareness has been raised, their learning attitudes have changed, and a large number of young people have gloriously joined the New Democratic Youth League. As of November last year, 1,583 people have joined the League, including 12 Manchus, 18 Mongols, and 34 Huis. League members play an active leading role in various movements. As of December 15 last year, more than 1,200 students had signed up to apply for military cadre schools.

    In the past, the garbage piled up next to the God of Wealth Temple for more than 20 years was ignored, and the dilapidated toilets were not repaired. In the past year, the People's Government has cleared more than 91,000 carts of garbage (more than 800 carts are still to be cleared); repaired the existing toilets, and built 13 new public toilets; sorted out the stalls; installed 384 street lights; allocated 200,000 catties of rice to build 78 seepage wells; renovated the main roads for farmers to enter the city; built more than 720,000 meters of roads; rebuilt the Longquan Park, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits; and mobilized citizens to plant 710,000 trees.

    Today, Gui Sui City presents a new scene. The new city, the old city, and the railway station are connected as a whole, and light and heavy industries and cultural districts surround the city. The market is prosperous and orderly, and the roads are wide and flat; the thick smoke billowing from the chimneys reminds people of a happy future. However, the people of Gui Sui City are well aware that a happy future must be gradually realized through "Resisting America and Aiding Korea," "Eliminating Bandits and Special Agents," and "Production and Construction."

　　欣欣向荣的归绥市
　　李铣
    “归绥市变了！”这是十三万五千多居民在回忆去年一年的成就时所得到的共同结论。的确，归绥市最初给人的印象是：萧条、混乱、肮脏和黑暗。大商号门户半掩，小商摊遍街皆是，大街小巷便溺满地。入夜一片昏暗，全市只有一百多盏路灯。这是一九四九年“九、一九”绥远光荣起义以后，而人民政府还没有入城以前的情景。
    仅仅一年，情况起了基本变化。一月二日在归绥市人民文化馆举办了“市人民政府成立周年纪念展览”，其中所陈列的照片和图表，生动而具体地说明了这个变化。
    工人在党的领导与教育之下，阶级觉悟空前提高，生产情绪高涨，技术不断改进。电讯局过去每天发生事故达一百二十件之多，现在已减低到二十件。京包铁路局归绥车务段于去年十二月十四日胜利完成二十万公里无事故运动，并将为开展五十万公里无事故运动而斗争。电面厂耗煤率已再度降低。工人们就在这种战斗的生活中度过一九五○年，并从生产运动中，涌现出大批积极分子与劳动模范。
    新的工厂在建立。绥兴建筑公司成立了，新生麻袋厂业已正式开工，被国民党彻底破坏的甘草厂在废墟上重建起来（甘草是绥远有名的土产，年产可达一千万斤），日出甘草精（可作糖果、酱油和西药）一百余斤。
    虽然，在去年三月份财经统一后，归绥市工商业曾一度发生不景气现象，但在人民政府调整工商业后，已逐渐获得恢复与发展。当时，人民政府曾进行了如下工作：（一）适当合理调整工商税收，并彻底废除了国民党反动派的苛捐杂税三十四种（包括不定率的摊派），相对地减轻了人民的负担。（二）国家银行发放贷款，解决了工商业者资金不足的困难。（三）执行并贯彻了劳资两利政策。先后有重点地组织了熟皮、造纸等十六个行业，建立劳资协商会议，其中已有十个行业签订了劳资集体合同，并调整了批发与零售差价，使私商有利可图。（四）人民政府与公营企业，有计划地采用加工，订货，代购，代销等方法，扶植了私营企业的生产。仅加工的白面，莜面即达八十三万斤。（五）沟通城乡关系，加强内外交流：市合作总社成立了农民招待所，给农民进城交流物资以极大方便。市回民生产供应社组织了一百五十个驮户、九百二十七头骆驼，补助了运输工具的不足。并将贸易发展到内蒙、甘肃一带。因之，归绥市工商业在人民政府领导之下蒸蒸日上，呈现一片蓬勃气象；现在，商业已由解放前的一千零二十二户，增加到一千二百九十户，工业由五百一十一户增加到八百五十一户。
    公安、司法机关执行了肃清匪特分子，安定社会秩序，保卫生产建设的任务。绥远地域偏远，又是华北最后解放的地区，故潜伏匪特分子较多。一年来，匪特首恶分子张华展（伪华北人民联合反共自卫军参谋兼第七路司令）等要犯均为我捕获并判处死刑。治安案件去年四月份曾达二百三十二起，十一月份减少到八十四起。同时成立了劳动大队，集中大批烟民、小偷、无业游民予以劳动改造。经过改造，他们由奄奄待毙，萎靡不振，变为红光满面，热爱劳动的新人。
    在劳动大队的二千五百三十六人中，原有二千二百五十一人吸食毒品。烟毒在绥远之所以为害如此之深，是与帝国主义、国民党反动统治有密切关系的。远在光绪年间，烟毒即由帝国主义分子输入绥远。国民党统治时代，不但种烟成为公开合法，而且反动政府收征巨额烟税，甚至将大烟挨户配售，百般诈取民财。因吸毒而倾家荡产、卖妻鬻子者到处皆是；甚至连十几岁的小孩，也有吸毒好几年的。人民政府成立后，大力禁绝烟毒，一年来通过劳动大队、小型戒烟所及在家戒除等方法，已有四千余人断瘾，估计占烟民总数的百分之五十四。去年十二月十七日，政府并将收缴的烟土、料面、假料面等全部焚毁。政府这种禁烟的决心，曾感动了广大市民。
    为执行共同纲领第四十条的规定，归绥市于去年四月二十四日、八月二十七日召开了两次各界人民代表大会。这是翻天覆地的大事，人民第一次当了主人。首届各界人民代表大会的十四项决议已全部实现。二届各界人民代表大会的三十四项决议也已大部实现。过去专门压迫人民的保甲制度已被推翻，由人民自己选举了闾、组长为大家办事。
    学生运动也发展起来了。在党和团的领导下，通过政治学习、青年讲座、学园生活，学生的觉悟提高了，学习态度改变了，大批青年光荣地参加了新民主主义青年团。截至去年十一月止，已有一千五百八十三人入团，其中有满族十二人、蒙族十八人、回族三十四人。团员在各种运动中起着积极带头作用。截至去年十二月十五日止，报名投考军事干部学校的学生就有一千二百余名。
    过去，财神庙旁堆积了二十多年的垃圾没人过问，残破的厕所没人修整。一年来，人民政府清除了垃圾九万一千余车（尚有八百多车待清除）；修整了原有的厕所，又新建公厕十三所；整理了摊贩；安装路灯三百八十四盏；拨米二十万斤修建了渗水井七十八个；翻修了农民的入城要道；建设道路七十二万余公尺；重建了被国民党匪帮破坏的龙泉公园；并发动市民植树七十一万株。
    今天，归绥市呈现着一片新的景象，新城、旧城、车站联成一片，轻重工业，文化区环绕在城的周围，市面繁荣而秩序井然，道路宽阔而平坦；烟囱里冒出的大股浓烟，使人联想到幸福的未来。但是，归绥市人民都很清楚：幸福的未来必须通过“抗美援朝”、“肃清匪特”、“生产建设”来逐步实现的。
