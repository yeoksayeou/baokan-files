In the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland propaganda movement, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee established 200 rapporteurs, who played a significant role in the ideological education of the masses.

[This dispatch is from our newspaper in Taiyuan] In the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland propaganda movement, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China designated 200 rapporteurs, who played a significant role in the propaganda. Han Chunde, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Standing Committee members Yu Lin, Wang Daren, and others all served as rapporteurs. The rapporteurs were assigned based on the division of the city's population by social occupation into thirteen categories, including workers, cultural and educational personnel, religious figures, and health workers. They were then assigned according to their usual connections with the masses to deliver systematic current affairs reports. For example, Rapporteur Comrade Ma Zhen, the Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, was responsible for delivering reports to workers. Rapporteur Comrade Wang Zhongqing, the Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, was responsible for delivering reports to universities and middle schools. This approach resulted in greater propaganda effectiveness. The rapporteurs' reports were prepared based on the unified propaganda outlines formulated by the Municipal Party Committee, combined with the ideological situation of the masses. Therefore, the reports were able to closely integrate political tasks with practical work, which allowed the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to be directed toward practical action. From November 8th to 15th last year, in eight days, the rapporteurs delivered a total of 625 reports, with a total audience of 70,963 people. After each report, a discussion forum was organized to further deepen the current affairs propaganda. A total of 705 such forums were organized, with 74,522 participants, all of whom expressed their opinions. The Municipal Party Committee also organized inspection teams to go deep into various aspects to collect feedback and questions from the audience. In addition, the Municipal Party Committee promptly provided the rapporteurs with various propaganda materials and published "Ideological Bulletins" for the rapporteurs to study, which reflected the ideological situation of people from all walks of life, introduced the work experience of the rapporteurs, or pointed out deviations in the movement. Currently, the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee is summarizing the work of the rapporteurs, reviewing the existing rapporteurs, and those who are qualified will be formally appointed, assigned fixed responsibilities, and implement the rapporteur responsibility system, so that this group of rapporteurs can become the backbone of a widely established propaganda network.

　　抗美援朝保家卫国宣传中
    太原市委建立二百名报告员         
    对群众思想教育起了重大作用
    【本报太原专电】中共太原市委在抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传运动中，曾指定了二百名报告员，他们在宣传中起了重大作用。市委书记韩纯德及常委于林、王大任等均担任了报告员；报告员的分工，首先是把全市人民按社会分工划为职工、文教、宗教、卫生等十三个方面，再按平素各报告员与群众的联系情况分工，对群众作有系统的时事报告。如报告员马真同志是市工会副主席，即负责到职工中去作报告；报告员王中青同志是省文教厅副厅长，即负责到大、中学校作报告。这样，收到的宣传效果较大。报告员的报告，都是根据市委统一制定的宣传提纲，结合群众思想情况进行准备的。因此报告都能把政治任务和实际工作密切结合起来，因而能够将抗美援朝运动引向实际行动。自去年十一月八日起至十五日八天中，报告员共作报告六百二十五次，听众达七万零九百六十三人。每次报告结束后，又组织座谈会，使时事宣传更加深入。这种座谈会共组织过七百零五次，有七万四千五百二十二人参加，都发表了自己的意见。市委并组织了检查团，深入到各方面去收集听众意见和问题。此外市委还及时供给报告员各种宣传资料；并出版了供报告员学习的“思想通报”，其中反映各阶层人民的思想状况，介绍报告员的工作经验，或指出运动中的偏向。现在太原市委正在总结报告员的工作，对现有报告员进行审查，合格者将给予正式任命，固定分工，实行报告员责任制，以使这批报告员成为广泛建立宣传网的骨干。
