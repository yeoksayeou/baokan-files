Strengthening the Connection Between Newspapers and the Working Masses
    This Newspaper Invites Workers from Beijing to Hold a Forum
    Editor's Note: In order to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the working masses, and to enable the newspaper to better promote production and construction and serve the working masses, this newspaper invited thirteen worker comrades from seven factories, including Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, 70th Ordnance Factory, North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, Trolley Repair Factory, Public Bus Company, and Xinhua Printing Factory, to hold a forum on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. During the meeting, everyone reflected on the production development and living improvement of each factory after liberation; and provided many extremely important opinions on wages, production bonuses, housing, medical care and diseases. This fully demonstrated the working class's love for the factory and their active spirit in improving work. The person in charge of this newspaper proposed at the meeting: worker forums will be held regularly in the future and will be established as a system. In the future, the newspaper will plan to discuss some important issues related to workers' production and life, as well as solutions, with worker representatives to strengthen ties with the working masses. This suggestion was warmly endorsed by the worker comrades present.
　(1) Workers' Efforts After Liberation
    In the speeches of the worker comrades present, it was mentioned that after liberation, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, the class consciousness of the workers has been raised. Thanks to the active leadership of the People's Government and the efforts of all employees, production has developed and improved rapidly.
    In the two years after liberation, Xinhua Printing Factory's production has increased by one and a half times due to the continuous increase in personnel and equipment. The output of a certain blast furnace at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has increased by an average of about 80 percent compared to before liberation. The Trolley Repair Factory launched two 100-trolley campaigns after liberation, and the factory completed its annual task in September last year. The Public Bus Company has increased its vehicles more than 20 times and its number of employees seven times compared to the early days of liberation; by converting buses from burning wood to burning coal, operating costs have been reduced by half. When North China Agricultural Machinery Factory started manufacturing agricultural tools, it lacked experience, and the water pumps produced were not suitable for rural needs; the hoes made were not strong enough due to the lack of hemp steel. After research and exploration by employees, it is now able to mass-produce new agricultural tools welcomed by farmers; and it has independently solved the difficulty of producing hemp steel.
    With the increase in production, each factory has also made some improvements in the lives and welfare of its employees. Shijingshan Power Plant is a good example of this, as Pei Qingyun of the plant said: The plant has made great improvements in production since liberation, and the welfare of its employees has also increased accordingly. This is because the plant's leading cadres, such as Director Liu Yingyuan, who came from a worker background, can deeply understand the workers' difficulties and demands. In each production contract, not only is it stipulated how to guarantee production, but also, based on the existing conditions, it is specifically stipulated which employee welfare problems should be solved. Last year, the power plant solved the major problem of coal smoke leakage in the pulverized coal furnace during production, which can save the country more than one million catties of millet every year; it dredged the circulating water ditch that had not been cleaned for decades since the plant was built; it implemented a regular maintenance system for machines; and it launched a campaign to eliminate hidden accidents. As a result, the machine load has increased, accidents have been greatly reduced, and in terms of worker welfare, new houses have been built in batches, and 200 employees now live in new houses. The allocation of houses was decided after democratic discussions by the workers, and the allocation is relatively reasonable. For employees living in old houses, the factory lent them money and supplied some lime, and the trade union mobilized everyone to help each other repair houses in their spare time. Because the factory is far from the city, it used to be very time-consuming for workers to go to the city to see a doctor. The factory submitted an application to the higher authorities to build a hospital, and now it is no problem for employees to see a doctor and have children. The sales of the cooperative account for 45 percent of the total wages of the employees. In the past, the canteen was not well run, and many employees ate at outside stalls. After careful improvement, very few people eat out now. Movies are shown almost every week. Currently, there is still a lack of an auditorium for holding meetings, which is one of the issues that needs to be resolved in the collective welfare of employees this year.
    During the forum, the workers reflected many demands and opinions on the current production, life and welfare. The main issues are now summarized as follows:
　(2) On the Issue of Wages
    Workers raised some questions about the current wage system and demanded that wages be adjusted in a planned manner with the development and improvement of production.
    Summarizing everyone's opinions, the problems currently existing in the wage system are primarily manifested in unequal pay for equal work in the same factory. According to Wang Weiyi of Beijing Public Bus Company: "Driving on the same bus, with the same skills but vastly different treatment, is because the wage standards are not unified. Some workers are on a daily wage system, which amounts to about 300 catties of millet per month, while others are on a monthly wage system, calculated in real units, which amounts to about 500 catties of millet per month." Pan Yaozhi of Xinhua Printing Factory also said: "Our factory also has this problem. Workers often raise opinions, demanding that the factory should appropriately increase the overly low wage part based on the universal improvement of labor productivity, and strive to gradually achieve unified wage standards." Jiao Yaozhong of Beijing Trolley Repair Factory pointed out: The factory has more than 100 young workers who have five or six years of seniority. They are no less skilled than the technicians recruited last year, and they take the lead in production everywhere, but they are still treated as apprentices, which is very unreasonable.
    The second problem in the wage system is that wage standards are not unified in the same industry. According to the meeting, there are three large state-owned machinery manufacturing factories in Beijing. Looking at the average wages of each factory, the 70th Ordnance Factory's monthly salary is 279 catties, the Machinery General Factory's is 320 catties, and the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory's is 340 catties. According to Lu Mao of the 70th Ordnance Factory: After liberation, because the production tasks are not regular, the wages of skilled workers are generally 240 to 300 catties of millet per month. Because of the low wages, about 100 people have jumped factories; some are engaged in other sideline production at night; and some take short-term leave due to illness to work outside. For example, Wu Baoheng, an ironworker (using a sledgehammer) with a family of five, earns 220 catties of millet per month, which is not enough to live on every month. He has to borrow money to eat a few days after receiving his salary. Now, the workers all understand that only by doing a good job in production can they improve their lives, so everyone urgently demands production tasks; at the same time, they hope to conduct a planned adjustment of the unreasonable phenomena in the current wage system.
　(3) On the Issue of Production Bonuses
    In the implementation of the bonus policy, unreasonableness and untimely payment are the main problems. The meeting also reflected many examples of how the failure to do a good job in rewarding work affected production.
    Tian Zhentang, a worker at North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, said: The factory used to (and has improved now) do a poor job in production rewards, which greatly damaged the workers' enthusiasm for production. Last year, the factory signed a contract with the Ministry of Water Resources to manufacture 3,000 waterwheels. First, the engineers studied the manufacturing method of the water pipes and repeatedly tested them, but they could not do it well. Seeing that the contract was about to expire, if the goods were delivered one day late, they would be fined 1,000 catties of millet. At this time, the leadership called on the workers to find a way. In less than two days, four workers, including Wang Changpei, succeeded in researching and developing the waterwheel, and the waterwheel task was completed on time. The administration originally stipulated that they would be given a bonus of 30 percent of the value they created. As a result, the amount was too large, and the leading cadres developed a "millet mentality." After a long delay, they were only awarded more than 300 catties of millet. The second time, the factory wanted to erect a four-zhang-high iron chimney. If they hired someone to build a scaffolding to erect it, it would cost more than 1,000 catties of millet. The worker Li Jinshu came up with a way to insert a wooden stick into the chimney and tie a rope to pull it up. Using this method, the chimney was erected. There was great danger during the work, and almost one person was injured. Li Jinshu was so nervous at the time that he got sick and spent 400-500 catties of millet to treat himself. However, the administration only awarded him 200 catties of millet, and said: "This method is not rare, someone has already thought of it." Li Jinshu and Liu Wenru, the worker who researched and manufactured the waterwheel pipes, were dissatisfied with the reward and have now left the Agricultural Machinery Factory to work elsewhere.
　(4) On the Issue of Housing
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government is concerned about the housing problem of employees. Last year, it allocated 2,000 rooms for employees to live in. However, workers still have some opinions on the housing problem. They believe that there are two unreasonable phenomena: One situation is that there are no or very few worker dormitories in the factory, and workers also encounter various difficulties in renting houses. For example, worker comrades pointed out that some landlords are very harsh on workers. If a dispute occurs between the two parties, the landlord will threaten to increase the rent. At the same time, they are also subject to extra exploitation by intermediaries when renting houses. Lu Mao of the 70th Ordnance Factory said: Most of the factory's workers still rent houses. They often encounter some landlords who are unwilling to rent houses to workers. Workers have to go through "house-lining" (intermediaries) to rent houses. They have to pay four or five months' rent in advance, the "house-lining" has to take a share, and the landlord has to rot a share (that is, take a month's rent for nothing). The worker Li Fusheng had a disagreement with the landlord, and the landlord proposed to increase the rent by ten catties, otherwise he would have to move out. The two sides argued and went to the police station. The police station allowed the landlord to increase the price. The worker refused to accept and appealed to the Municipal People's Court. The court accepted the landlord's further demands and ruled that the landlord could increase the price by twelve catties. Therefore, workers are afraid of going to court with the landlord. First, they cannot afford to miss work, and second, the result of the lawsuit is often that the landlord increases the rent. Some workers said: "A reasonable increase in rent is acceptable, but we should also understand the difficulties of the workers. Now, the rent has increased by more than double, but our wages have not increased."
    Lu Mao also proposed that the government should establish a special organization to manage the rental problem, so that the rent is reasonable, avoid intermediate exploitation, and workers and citizens can rent houses to live in.
    The other situation of the housing problem is that some enterprise leaders do not pay enough attention to it, fail to make the greatest efforts to find solutions, or fail to absorb the opinions of the working masses when allocating existing houses, resulting in unreasonable allocation. For example, Tian Zhentang of North China Agricultural Machinery Factory pointed out that some worker dormitories in the factory do not have electric lights. Workers have been constantly raising opinions for more than a year, but they have not yet been installed. Secondly, workers living in the factory do not pay rent; workers living in houses allocated by the Qingguan Bureau outside the factory pay a part of the rent; and workers renting houses outside the factory pay all the rent themselves. This phenomenon is also unreasonable.
　(5) On the Issue of Diseases and Medical Care
    During the forum, everyone had the following opinions on the issues of employees' diseases and medical care: (1) The medical equipment in some factories is too poor to meet the needs of employees; (2) The factory administration and trade union are doing too poorly in terms of employee labor insurance benefits and worker mutual assistance, workers are prone to illness, and they cannot afford to treat it when they are sick; (3) Some medical personnel lack a good style of conscientiously serving the working class and fail to treat workers with a careful and responsible attitude. Some of these problems cannot be completely resolved in a short period of time due to economic constraints; but many problems can be improved and resolved if leading cadres or medical personnel pay attention to them ideologically.
    Lu Mao of the 70th Ordnance Factory said: The factory's workers are dissatisfied with the factory's clinic. The workers say that it "cannot cure serious illnesses, and cannot cure minor illnesses." The problem is the lack of funds and medicine, but the doctor has to see the workers. The total monthly medical expenses of the factory are more than 14 million yuan. The monthly medical expenses and outpatient expenses for workers in the hospital are no less than 10 million yuan. Therefore, the factory clinic only has more than 4 million yuan left for medical expenses each month; but there are about 6,000 workers in the factory who see a doctor every month, and the difficulty of medicine costs can be imagined. In particular, very few workers with chronic diseases can afford to stay in the hospital. Most of them stay at home for recuperation, and the trade union is doing very poorly in terms of labor insurance benefits, so workers ask to go to work before they are healed. Some workers know that they are sick, but they are afraid of being found out to be sick and unable to work.
    Pan Yaozhi of Xinhua Printing Factory pointed out that the factory's two doctors are both technically okay, but their medical style is not good. They are very careless in seeing patients and do not carefully examine or diagnose. For general patients, they just ask a few questions and prescribe a prescription.

　　加强报纸与工人群众的联系
    本报邀请京市工人举行座谈
    编者按：为加强报纸与工人群众的联系，使报纸更好地推动生产建设及为工人群众服务，本报于本月十八日下午，邀请北京石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、七十兵工厂、华北农业机械厂、电车修造厂、公共汽车公司、新华印刷厂等七厂的十三位工人同志举行座谈。会中，大家反映了各厂在解放后生产发展及生活改善的情形；并对工资、生产奖励、住房、医药疾病等方面提供了很多极为重要的意见。充分表现了工人阶级热爱工厂和改进工作的积极精神。本报负责同志在会上提出：今后将要定期地召开工人座谈会，并把它定为制度。今后报纸要有计划地同工人代表讨论一些有关工人生产及生活的重要问题和解决的办法，加强同工人群众的联系。这一意见得到到会工人同志的热烈赞同。
　（一）解放后工人的努力
    到会工人同志的发言中都讲到，解放后在中国共产党的领导和教育下，工人的阶级觉悟提高了。由于人民政府积极领导及全体职工的努力，生产在很快地发展和提高。
    新华印刷厂在解放后两年中，由于人员和设备不断增加，生产提高了一倍半。石景山钢铁厂某高炉产量较解放前平均提高百分之八十左右。电车修造厂解放后两次进行百辆电车运动，该厂在去年九月份即完成了全年的任务。公共汽车公司较初解放时车辆增加二十余倍，职工数目扩大七倍；因将烧木柴的汽车改装而烧煤炭，运行成本降低一半。华北农业机械厂在开始制造农具时缺乏经验，做出的水泵不适合农村需要；打制的耘锄因缺少麻钢，很不坚固。经过职工的研究、摸索，现在已能大量制造为农民所欢迎的新式农具；并自行解决了生产麻钢的困难。
    随着生产的提高，各厂对职工生活和福利事业也或多或少的有些改进，石景山发电厂就是其中一个很好的实例，正如该厂裴庆云说的：该厂在解放以后，生产有很大改进，职工的福利也随之提高。这是因为该厂的领导干部，像工人出身的刘英源厂长等，能深切了解工人的困难和要求。在每一期的生产合同中，不单订出如何保证生产，同时也根据现有条件，具体订出要解决那些职工福利问题。去年一年，发电厂在生产中，曾解决了重大的煤粉炉的跑煤烟问题，每年能给国家节省百余万斤小米；掏挖了建厂数十年以来未清理过的循环水沟；实行了机器的定期检修制；展开了消灭隐形事故运动。因此，机器负荷提高，事故大大减少，在工人福利方面，曾分批盖了新房，现有二百多职工住上了新房。对房子的分配，是经过工人民主讨论决定的，分配比较合理。对于住旧房的职工，厂方借给他们钱，供给一部分石灰，由工会发动大家在工余时间互助修房。因为该厂距城较远，过去工人进城看病很误事，厂里呈准上级，盖了医院，现职工看病及生小孩已不成问题。合作社的售货额，占全体职工工资的百分之四十五。过去食堂搞的不好，职工很多到外面小摊上吃饭。经过认真改进，出外吃饭的人很少了。现在几乎每礼拜都放电影。开大会，目前还缺少一个礼堂，这是今年职工集体福利事业中所需解决的事项之一。
    在座谈中，工人们对当前的生产、生活和福利事业反映了许多要求和意见。现在把主要的问题分别整理如下：
　（二）关于工资问题
    工人们对目前工资制度提出了一些问题，要求随着生产的发展和提高，有计划地调整工资。
    综合大家的意见，目前工资制度中存在的问题，首先表现在同一工厂同工不同酬。据北京市公共汽车公司王惟一谈：“同在一个车上开车，技术相同而待遇悬殊，这是因为工资标准不统一。有的工人是日薪制，每月合三百来斤小米，另有一部分工人是月薪制，按折实单位计，每月合五百来斤小米。”新华印刷厂潘尧治也说：“我们厂也存在这个问题，工人经常提意见，要求厂方应该根据劳动生产率的普遍提高，把过低的工资部分适当提高，争取逐步地达到统一工资标准。”北京电车公司修造厂焦耀中指出：该厂有一百多名青工，都有五、六年工龄，在技术上并不比去年招考的技工低，且在生产上处处带头，但至今他们仍按徒工待遇，这是很不合理的。
    工资制度中第二个问题是：同一行业中工资标准不统一。据会中反映：北京市有三个较大的公营机器制造工厂，以各厂平均工资来看，七十兵工厂月薪二七九斤，机器总厂为三二○斤，华北农业机械厂为三四○斤。据七十兵工厂工人路懋谈：该厂在解放后，因为生产任务不经常。技术工人的工资一般是每月二百四十至三百斤小米。因为工资低，已有百十来人跳厂；还有的在夜晚进行其他副业生产；有的则借病请短期假，出外做活。如铁工（拿大锤）吴保恒五口之家，月薪二百二十斤米，月月不够用，发薪不几天就得借钱吃饭。现在，工人们都懂得：只有搞好了生产才能改善生活，所以大家迫切要求生产任务；同时希望将目前工资制度中的不合理现象进行一次有计划的调整。
　（三）关于生产奖励问题
    在执行奖励政策中，不合理和不及时是当前的主要问题。会中并反映了许多因奖励工作没有搞好，影响生产的实例。
    华北农业机械厂工人田振棠说：该厂过去（现在已有改进）对生产奖励作的不好，大大损害了工人的生产积极性。去年，该厂和水利部订了制造三千部水车的合同。先由工程师研究水管的制造方法，一再试验，老作不好。眼看合同快到期了，如货物迟交一天，就要受罚小米一千斤。这时领导上才号召工人想办法。不两天，就有王常佩等四个工人研究成功，水车任务得以按时完成。行政上原规定按他们创造价值的百分之三十给奖。计算结果，数目太大，领导干部就产生了“小米观点”。拖延很久，才奖给他们三百多斤小米。第二次，是厂里要立一个四丈多高的铁烟筒，若雇人搭架子立，得用一千多斤米。工人李金树想出一个办法：用一根木棍插在烟筒里，绑上绳子往起拉。就用这办法把烟筒竖起来了。工作时冒很大危险，几乎摔坏一个人。李金树当时过度紧张，因此得了病，自己治病用了四、五百斤米。而行政上只奖给他二百斤米，还说：“这法子并不稀奇，早就有人想出过。”李金树和研究制造水车管子的工人刘文儒因对奖励不满意，现已离开农业机械厂到别处工作去了。
　（四）关于住房问题
    京市人民政府对职工住房问题是关心的，去年曾拨了两千间房子给职工住。但目前工人同志对住房问题还有些意见，他们认为有两种不合理的现象：一种情况是，厂内没有或很少有工人宿舍，工人在租赁房子时也遭受各种困难。如工人同志提出，有些房主对工人很苛刻，双方如果发生纠纷，房主就要以加房租来威胁。同时，租房子时还要受到中间人的额外剥削。七十兵工厂路懋同志说：该厂工人绝大部分都还租房子住。他们常常遇到有些房主不愿意把房子租给工人。工人要通过拉房线的（中间人）才能租到房子。租下房子得先交四、五个月的房租，拉房线的要吃一份，房东要烂一份（即白拿一个月房租）。工人李富升因为和房东闹点意见，房东就提出要加房租十斤，不然就要他搬家。双方争执起来，闹到公安局派出所，派出所允许房主加价。工人不服，上告到市人民法院，法院又接受了房主进一步的要求，判决房主可以加十二斤。因此工人们都怕和房主打官司，一来是误不起工，二来是打官司的结果往往是房主加房租。有的工人说：“合理的增加房租是可以的，但也应该了解工人的困难。现在，房租涨了一倍以上，我们的工资并没有增加。”
    路懋同志并提出，希望政府能成立一个专门组织来管理租房问题，使房租合理，免去中间剥削，工人、市民能租到房子住。
    住房问题的另一种情况是，有些企业领导干部对此不够重视，未尽最大努力设法解决，或在分配现有房子时，不能吸收工人群众的意见，因而分配不合理。如华北农业机械厂田振棠同志提出，该厂有些工人宿舍没有电灯，一年多来工人不断提意见，至今尚未按装。其次，住在厂内的工人不出房钱；住厂外清管局所分配的房子的工人出一部分房租；在厂外租房住的全部自己出房租。这种现象也不合理。
　（五）关于疾病医药问题
    在座谈中，大家对职工的疾病和医药问题有这样几种意见：（一）有些厂医药设备太差，不能满足职工的需要；（二）工厂行政和工会对职工的劳动保险福利及工人的互助问题作的太差，工人容易生病，病了无力医治；（三）某些医疗人员缺乏认真为工人阶级服务的优良作风，未能以细心负责的态度给工人医病。这其中有的是因为受经济条件的限制，短时间尚不能完全解决；但有许多问题，如果领导干部或医务人员从思想上引起注意，是可以求得改进和解决的。
    七十兵工厂路懋同志谈：该厂工人对厂内医务所不满意，工人们说它：“大病治不了，小病治不好。”问题是经费困难，药品缺乏，但大夫又不得不给工人看病。工厂每月医药费总数是一千四百多万元，平均每月工人住院的医药费用及外出门诊开支不下一千万元，因此工厂医务所每月仅余医药费四百多万元；但全厂每月看病的工人约有六千余名，药费的困难可想而知。特别是得了慢性病的工人，能住起医院的很少。大多住在家里休养，而工会在劳动保险福利方面作的又很差，所以，工人病未好就要求上工。有的工人明知自己有病，也怕检查出病来不能工作。
    新华印刷厂潘尧治同志提出，该厂的两个医生技术都还可以，就是医疗作风不好，看病很马虎，不认真检查、诊断。对一般的病人，只是问上几句就给开药方。
