　　Several Working Methods for Radio Announcers to Expand Propaganda
　　A Cong
　　In May of last year, the Central People's Broadcasting Station established its own radio listening network according to the News Administration’s "Decision on Establishing a Radio Listening Network." By the end of the year, it had developed 702 radio listeners and received 2,140 letters from listeners (including radio listeners). The radio listening network—this kind of organization that connects listeners—has proven to be very important. It can enable broadcasting work to further exert its due propaganda and educational effectiveness on a solid mass basis. Especially during the peace signature and Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda campaigns, many radio listeners in various places have conducted extensive propaganda to the masses based on the broadcast propaganda materials they heard. Some radio listeners even directly collected peace signatures and volunteer applications to join the Resist America, Aid Korea Volunteer Army. They are not only propagators of current affairs policies, but also organizers of mass movements.
　　The radio listeners of the Central People's Broadcasting Station can be divided into several different types according to their work: some are radio listeners who specialize in transcribing news for urban newspapers; some are radio listeners who specialize in listening to lectures; and some are radio listeners who listen to news programs and transcribe news, and then directly transmit important content to the broad masses in oral or written form. In terms of quantity, the third type of radio listener is the most numerous. They are mostly full-time radio listeners of the Party and government organs in various counties, distributed throughout the country. In terms of the effect of propaganda and close contact with the masses, this type of radio listener plays a relatively large role. In more than half a year of work, they have created many noteworthy working methods through exploration.
　　The first is the working method of the radio broadcasting group in Yutian County, Hebei Province.
　　The radio listeners of the Yutian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province have paid attention to the work of building radio broadcasting groups at the grassroots level since they started working in May last year. At first, there was only one radio broadcasting group in Xiguan Primary School in the county seat. By the beginning of December, it had developed into 56 radio broadcasting groups. These listening groups are distributed in 56 schools, streets, and villages in urban and rural areas, of which 6 are key broadcasting stations. These listening groups have 100 members, most of whom are primary school teachers, students, and young farmers. They widely disseminate the materials obtained by the radio listeners of the county committee through 120 blackboard newspapers and 75 rooftop broadcasting stations.
　　The development of listening groups in Yutian County was not without twists and turns. When they first established listening groups, many members looked down on this work, thinking it was a trivial matter and would not have a great effect; others thought that it would be difficult to broadcast on the rooftop and copy blackboard newspapers because of the cold weather. The radio listeners of the county committee criticized these wrong ideas at two members' meetings and emphasized: "The broadcasting station and the blackboard newspaper are our fortress, and the loudspeaker, blackboard, and chalk are our weapons. The cold weather cannot hinder our battle. We must quickly transmit the good news of fighting for peace to our fellow villagers!" After repeated explanations, the members' thoughts were clarified, and some activists gradually emerged. For example, Comrade Chen Huanwen in Beiguan, Yutian County, often froze his hands while copying blackboard newspapers, but he did not feel bitter. After copying, he also mobilized nearby men, women, old and young to watch. Fearing that they would not understand, he personally read it to them. Comrade Wen Han of Dadingzhuang often read an important material several times during rooftop broadcasting to make sure everyone remembered it deeply. When reading something difficult to understand, he patiently explained it and asked the listeners to ask questions, which he would answer. Comrade Yin Limin of the Xiguan Primary School listening group in the county seat told the students about the daily radio materials at the morning assembly. One day, when he talked about the brutal crimes of American imperialism in slaughtering many Korean children, many primary school students shed tears of anger and grief. They donated the money they saved from buying candy to help the Korean people and wrote a letter to General Kim Il-sung. The letter said: "Use this money to make more bullets and smash the heads of the American bandits!"
　　The radio listeners of the Yutian County Committee are in close contact with the members of the listening groups. They have correspondence with several key listening groups every day; through the key listening groups, they understand the working conditions of all listening groups in the county, provide them with materials, listen to their opinions, and improve their work. As the work progressed, the materials transcribed by the radio listeners needed to be reproduced in more and more copies. The reproduction and distribution of these materials is one of the main conditions for ensuring the smooth progress of the listening groups. The radio listeners united a group of activists to help him do the reproduction and distribution work. For example, Ruan Qi, a member of the Young Pioneers in Xiguan Primary School in the county seat, is an active little "correspondent" who goes to the radio room to pick up materials on time, regardless of wind or rain. Once, when the radio listener was not at home, he waited until the radio listener came back to get the materials, even though he was hungry. The radio listener had a particularly good relationship with little Ruan Qi. To reward him for his active work spirit, the radio listener gave him his fountain pen as a prize.
　　Now, the work of the listening groups in Yutian County has a complete set of working systems, which were formulated by the group members' meeting of the radio broadcasting group based on the following principles: (1) The radio listener must ensure timely and regular supply of materials to each broadcasting group. (2) There should be fixed times for sending and receiving materials, and a dedicated person should be responsible. The "correspondent" should ensure rapid transmission. (3) In the event of important materials, the radio listener should put forward specific handling opinions, such as requiring the broadcasting group to organize "mobile broadcasting" or organize discussions in addition to general propaganda. (4) Each group should be responsible for quickly reflecting the propaganda effect.
　　Through listening groups, Yutian County can spread important current affairs news throughout the county on the same day. The villagers are very concerned about the broadcast materials. Some people said: "Our radio listeners in Yutian County have really become the 'Shenxing Taibao' Dai Zong!"
　　The second is the working method of the mimeographed newspaper and blackboard newspaper of the People's Cultural Center in Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province.
　　Gaoyao County in Guangdong Province is a medium-sized county town, relatively far away from the central city. It takes two or three days to see the Guangzhou newspapers, so it is very necessary to carry out radio listening work. The radio listener of the People's Cultural Center in Gaoyao County had difficulty recording a complete news story at the beginning because he was not used to listening to Beijing dialect, but with the help of comrades from the People's Cultural Center and the County Government's Bureau of Culture and Education, he overcame this difficulty. The director-general of the Cultural Center personally helped with the listening and personally presided over the compilation and printing of a sixteen-open mimeographed newspaper and a blackboard newspaper, once a day, which was very popular among the masses. This not only boosted the radio listener's morale and confidence, but also enabled him to gradually get used to listening to Beijing dialect. The Cultural Center and the County Government's Bureau of Culture and Education also realized the importance of using radio listening for propaganda through this work. The Cultural Center made the running of mimeographed newspapers and blackboard newspapers a regular task, and the Bureau of Culture and Education used rural primary schools to spread the news in the mimeographed newspapers to remote areas. Now, the content of their mimeographed newspapers includes recorded news from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and brief local news. The content of the blackboard newspaper mainly adopts the propaganda materials of "Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland" broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the "Blackboard Newspaper Materials" broadcast every other day. The county prints more than 1,400 copies of mimeographed newspapers and publishes 485 blackboard newspapers every day. The Second District Government of Gaoyao County also promoted its work through blackboard newspapers, regularly issuing news from the district, which played a great role in implementing the policies and decrees of the People's Government.
　　Now, the materials for the mimeographed newspapers and blackboard newspapers in Gaoyao County can be seen by the masses in the urban area at 7:00 a.m. every morning, and can be sent to the district governments by the county government's transport personnel on the same evening, and can be sent to the villages on the second or third day, two or three days earlier than the Southern Daily published in Guangzhou. Some farmers who had never read newspapers before now also know about state affairs. Those who are illiterate find someone to read it to them. The people have shown great concern and love for the motherland and for cultural life.
　　The third is the working method of wired broadcasting in Changli County, Hebei Province.
　　Changli County in Hebei Province is a relatively large county in eastern Hebei Province with very convenient transportation. The county seat has power plant facilities. The radio listening work of the Changli County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has a history of one year. In this year, they vigorously carried out the work of wired broadcasting according to their own conditions. Why should we carry out wired broadcasting? First, because transportation is convenient, newspapers can arrive in a timely manner. If the radio listener transcribes the recorded news and then prints and distributes propaganda materials, it will not be as fast as newspapers. Second, because the county has better material conditions, the county seat has power, and it does not cost much money and effort to install loudspeakers. Third, the radio listener and the cultural center and the Changli County Women's Normal School cooperate very well, and the students of the Women's Normal School voluntarily help with the broadcasting work. The county committee's radio listener seized these conditions and established the work of wired broadcasting in the county seat, which has made great progress in the past year. In May, there were 43 broadcasters who formed 12 groups; in December, the number of broadcasters expanded to 62, who formed 20 groups. A total of 28 loudspeakers have been installed throughout the county seat. Whenever there is important news, all the people in the city can know it immediately.
　　How does the radio listener of Changli County conduct propaganda through wired broadcasting? Generally, there are two ways: first, use loudspeakers to rebroadcast important programs from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Baoding People's Broadcasting Station. Second, the important recorded news transcribed by the radio listener and the important news of the county and important notices of the county government are handed over to the cultural center and the broadcasting team for sorting out before being broadcast. The cultural center is responsible for the business guidance of the broadcasters; the radio listener is mainly responsible for supplying materials and organizing the broadcast.
　　The students of the Women's Normal School who participated in the broadcasting work were very enthusiastic. They started working every day after class in the afternoon. Each group takes turns, and they never interrupt their work even in storms. When they encounter dark weather, they also bring flashlights to broadcast. The reason why the students of the Women's Normal School are so enthusiastic is partly because they have personally seen that this work has had a profound impact among the masses and have personally realized the joy of "serving the people"; on the other hand, they have also improved their cultural and political level and their interest in studying current affairs in the broadcasting work. Therefore, many of them bought "Current Affairs Manuals" and often conduct current affairs discussions.
　　The radio listener of the Changli County Committee has used the loudspeaker, a powerful weapon, to carry out the work of expanding current affairs propaganda in a timely and effective manner, which has played a great role among the masses. For example, Li Xingeng, a resident of Erjie Street in Changli County, said after listening to the broadcast: "American imperialism's launching of a war of aggression is the most inhumane! Who among the people does not oppose the war of aggression? Who does not want peace!" Li Xingsheng, the owner of Tongfu Business, said angrily after listening to the broadcast: "The American devils dare to stir up trouble and launch a war of aggression. Let's all sign the peace declaration! The American devils dare to break ground on the Grand Duke's head, and we must send it on Hitler's old path!" Most of the villagers jumped up happily after hearing the news that American imperialism was defeated in Korea and said: "The final victory must belong to the Korean people!"
　　Now, the people in Changli County have developed the habit of listening to news. For example, Li Bingheng, a cigarette vendor in Dongguan, listens to the radio while selling cigarettes every day, and discusses the content of the broadcast with the people around him after listening to it. The owner of Tianyixing Tea Shop automatically bought a small loudspeaker to listen to the broadcast. Sometimes, when the radio malfunctions and the broadcast is temporarily suspended, many people go to the cultural center to inquire, which shows how concerned the masses are about the broadcast.

　　广播收音员进行扩大宣传的几种工作方法
    阿丛
    去年五月，中央人民广播电台根据新闻总署“关于建立广播收音网的决定”，建立了自己的广播收音网。到年底为止，已经发展了收音员七百零二名，收到听众（其中包括收音员）的信件，有二千一百四十封。收音网——这种联系听众的组织，已经证明是非常重要的，它能使广播工作在确实的群众基础上进一步发挥应有的宣传教育的效能。特别是在和平签名和抗美援朝的宣传运动中间，各地有许多收音员，都根据收听到的广播宣传材料，向群众进行了广泛的宣传，有的收音员还直接征集了和平签名和参加抗美援朝志愿军的志愿书。他们不仅是时事政策的宣传者，也成了群众运动的组织者。
    中央人民广播电台的收音员，根据他们工作情况，可以分成几种不同的性质：有专门抄收记录新闻供城市报纸采用的收音员；有专门收听讲座的收音员；也有收听新闻节目和抄收记录新闻以后，通过口头或文字的形式，把重要内容直接传达给广大群众的收音员。在数量上，以第三种性质的收音员为最多，他们又大多是各县党、政机关的专职收音员，分布到全国各地。在宣传的效果和与群众的密切联系上，这一种性质的收音员起着比较大的作用。在半年多的工作中，他们从摸索中创造了不少值得介绍的工作方法。
    第一种是河北省玉田县的广播小组的工作方法。
    河北省中共玉田县委机关的收音员，自从去年五月份开始工作以来，就注意了在下层建设广播小组的工作。起初，只有县城西关小学一个广播小组，到十二月初为止，已经发展到五十六个广播小组了。这些收听小组分布在城乡五十六个学校、街道和村子里，其中有六个是重点广播站。这些收听小组拥有一百名组员，他们多数是小学教师、学生和青年农民。他们通过一百二十块黑板报和七十五处屋顶广播台，把县委机关收音员收听广播得来的材料，广泛地传布到群众中间去。
    玉田县发展收听小组的工作，并不是没有波折的。他们最初成立收听小组的时候，有不少组员看不起这件工作，认为这是小事，作用不会大；还有人认为，天气冷了，屋顶广播和抄写黑板报都有困难。县委的收音员在两次组员大会上，针对这些错误想法，给予批判，并且强调提出：“广播台和黑板报是我们的堡垒，喇叭筒、黑板和粉笔就是我们的武器，天冷阻碍不了我们战斗，我们要把为和平而斗争的好消息迅速的传给老乡们！”经过反复的解释，打通了组员们的思想，逐渐涌现了一些积极分子。比如玉田县城北关的陈焕文同志经常为了抄写黑板报冻裂了手背，但他不以为苦，抄写完了还动员附近的男女老幼来看，怕看不懂，他还亲自念给大家听。大丁庄的文瀚同志进行屋顶广播时，为了让大家记得深刻，他常常把一个重要的材料念上好几遍，在念到不容易懂的地方，就加以耐心的解释，还要求听广播的人提出问题，由他解答。县城西关小学收听小组尹立民同志，把每天的收音材料，在早晨朝会上讲给学生们听。有一天，他说到美帝国主义的残暴罪行，屠杀了好多朝鲜的小朋友的时候，有不少小学生气愤悲痛地掉下眼泪，他们纷纷把自己省下的糖果钱，捐出来帮助朝鲜人民，同时还写信给金日成将军。信里面写道：“用这些钱多造几颗子弹，把美国强盗的脑袋打碎吧！”
    玉田县委的收音员和收听小组的组员们的联系是很密切的。每天都和几个重点收听小组有便信往来；通过重点收听小组，了解全县各个收听小组的工作情况，供给他们材料，倾听他们的意见，改进自己的工作。由于工作的开展，收音员抄收的材料，也一天比一天需要复印更多的份数了。这些材料的复印和分送，是保证收听小组顺利进行工作的主要条件之一，收音员便团结了一批积极分子，帮助他做复印和分送的工作。像县城西关小学的学生，少年儿童队队员阮起，就是一位积极的小“通讯员”，他不论风天雨天，都准时到收音室去取材料。有一次，收音员不在家，他饿着肚子一直等到收音员回来拿了材料才走。收音员和阮起小同学的关系搞得特别好，为了奖励他这种积极工作的精神，收音员把自己的自来水笔送给他作奖品。
    现在，玉田县的收听小组的工作已经有了一整套工作制度，这一套制度是经过广播小组组员会议讨论，根据下面的几条原则制定的：（一）收音员要保证及时和经常供给各广播小组的材料。（二）收发材料要有定时，有专人负责，“通讯员”保证迅速传送。（三）遇到重要材料，收音员要提出具体的处理意见，例如要求广播小组除了一般的宣传以外，还要组织“流动广播”或是组织讨论等。（四）各小组要负责迅速反映宣传效果。
    玉田县通过收听小组，将重要的时事消息，当天就可以传遍全县，老乡对于广播材料非常关心，有人说：“咱们玉田县的收音员，真成了神行太保戴宗了！”
    第二种是广东省高要县人民文化馆的油印报和黑板报的工作方法。
    广东省高要县，是一个中等县城，离开中心城市比较远，要两三天以后才能看到广州的报纸，因此，开展收音工作是很需要的。高要县人民文化馆的收音员，在开始工作时，听不惯北京话，很难记录下一篇完整的新闻，但是在人民文化馆和县政府文教科同志们的帮助下，克服了这个困难。文化馆的总干事亲自帮助收听，并且亲自主持编印了一份十六开大小的油印报和一块黑板报，每天一次，大受群众欢迎。这样，不但鼓舞了收音员的情绪和信心，并使他终于慢慢听惯了北京话。文化馆和县政府文教科也通过这件工作，了解到收听广播进行宣传的重要性。文化馆把办油印报和黑板报订成了经常性的工作任务，文教局通过乡村小学把油印报上的消息传布到偏僻的地区里去。现在他们那里油印报的内容，包括中央人民广播电台的记录新闻和当地简要新闻。黑板报的内容，主要是采用中央人民广播电台广播的“抗美援朝保家卫国”的宣传材料，和隔一天一次的“黑板报材料”。全县每天印油印报一千四百多份，出黑板报四百八十五块。高要县第二区区政府并且通过黑板报推动工作，经常发出本区新闻，对于贯彻人民政府的政策法令，起了很大的作用。
    现在高要县的油印报和黑板报材料每天早上七点钟就可以让市区以内的群众看到，当天晚上，可以由县政府的交通员送到各区区政府，第二、三天可以送到各乡村，比广州出版的南方日报要早到两三天。有些过去从来没有看过报纸的农民，现在也知道了国家大事。不识字的找人念给他听，人民表现了对于祖国和对于文化生活的很大关切和热爱。
    第三种是河北省昌黎县有线广播的工作方法。
    河北省昌黎县，是河北省东部一个比较大的县份，交通非常方便，县城有发电厂的设备。中共昌黎县委会的收音工作，已经有了一年的历史。在这一年里面，他们根据自己的条件，大力开展了有线广播的工作。为什么要开展有线广播呢？第一，是因为交通方便，报纸及时可到，如果收音员抄收记录新闻以后，再印发宣传材料，那就赶不上报纸快了。第二，是因为该县物质条件比较好，县城就有电源，按装扩音器不怎么费钱费事。第三，是收音员和文化馆、和昌黎县女师的合作都很好，女师同学自愿帮助作播音工作。县委收音员抓住这几个条件，建立了县城的有线广播的工作，一年来有了很大的开展。在五月份，有播音员四十三人，成立了十二个小组；十二月份，播音员扩大到六十二个人，成立了二十个小组。全县城一共装按了二十八个扩音器，每逢有重要消息，立刻就可以让全城老百姓都能知道。
    昌黎县的收音员是怎样通过有线广播进行宣传的呢？一般的是通过两种方式：第一，利用扩音器转播中央人民广播电台和保定人民广播电台的重要节目。第二，把收音员抄收下来的重要记录新闻，和本县的重要消息、县政府的重要通知，交由文化馆和播音员小组负责整理以后，再播送出去。播音员的业务指导工作，由文化馆负责；收音员主要负责供给材料，组织播音。
    参加播音工作的女师同学，情绪都非常高，每天下午下课以后，她们就开始工作了。每个小组轮班，那怕是狂风暴雨，她们也从不间断工作，碰到漆黑的天气，拿上手电筒也要来播音。女师同学们情绪高的原因，一方面是因为亲眼见到这个工作在群众中间发生了很深的影响，切身体会到“为人民服务”的愉快；一方面，自己在播音工作中间，也提高了文化政治水平和研究时事的兴趣，所以，她们有很多人买了“时事手册”，经常进行时事讨论。
    昌黎县委的收音员，通过扩音器这个有力的武器，及时有效的进行了扩大时事宣传的工作，在群众中起的作用是很大的。比如昌黎县二街的居民李新耕听了广播以后说：“美帝国主义发动侵略战争，是最惨无人道的了！老百姓谁不反对侵略战争呢？谁不愿意和平呢！”通福商号掌柜的李兴盛听了广播以后，愤恨地说：“美国鬼子竟敢无事生非的发动侵略战争，咱们都在和平宣言上签名吧！美国鬼子敢在太岁头上动土，咱们就一定要把它赶上希特勒的老路！”多数老乡听了美帝国主义在朝鲜打败仗的消息，都高兴得跳了起来说：“最后胜利一定是朝鲜人民的！”
    现在昌黎县城的老百姓，已经养成了听新闻的习惯。像东关卖烟的小贩李秉恒，每天一面卖烟一面听广播，听了以后还和他附近的人一起讨论广播的内容。天义兴茶食店掌柜的自动买了一个小喇叭收听广播。有时候碰到收音机发生故障，播音暂时停顿，就有很多人到文化馆去打听，可见群众是怎样关心广播的了。
