Editor's Note: This article was written by Comrade Wu Yuzhang for the newspaper "For Lasting Peace! For People's Democracy!", and has been published in the 119th issue of the newspaper on February 16th.

　　The Chinese people are warmlycelebrating the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

　　The deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union has long existed. From the day the Soviet Union was founded after the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution until the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin, have consistently assisted the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech at the railway station upon arriving in Moscow on December 16, 1949: "After the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet government, according to the policies of Lenin and Stalin, first abolished the unequal treaties imposed on China during the Tsarist era. In nearly thirty years, the Soviet people and the Soviet government have assisted the cause of liberation of the Chinese people several times. The Chinese people will never forget this fraternal friendship from the Soviet people and the Soviet government in times of distress." In his message celebrating Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "In the arduous struggle against the oppressors, the Chinese people deeply feel the importance of Comrade Stalin's friendship."

　　The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements on February 14, 1950, consolidated this deep friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union in the form of a treaty. This friendship and unity has a great impact on the victory of the cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism.

　　This treaty declares that China and the Soviet Union will jointly prevent Japan or any state colluding with Japan in aggressive actions from re-engaging in aggression and undermining peace, and promote the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. If either of the two countries is subjected to aggression by Japan or a state allied with Japan, and is therefore in a state of war, the other country shall provide military and other assistance with all its strength.

　　This treaty declares that China and the Soviet Union are willing to cooperate sincerely, actively participate in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security, guarantee to contribute fully to the realization of this goal, and consult with each other on all major international issues concerning the common interests of the two countries.

　　Finally, this treaty declares that the two countries shall mutually guarantee to develop and consolidate the economic and cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union in the spirit of friendly cooperation and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, provide each other with all possible economic assistance, and carry out necessary economic cooperation.

　　These are the main contents of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. From this it can be seen that the signing of this treaty has given our China an extremely powerful ally that it has never had in its history, thereby consolidating the revolutionary victory already achieved by the Chinese people and greatly strengthening the forces of world peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, because it has increased the guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.

　　In the past year, the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, which have formed a friendly alliance, have stood shoulder to shoulder in defending world peace and have won great victories.

　　In all international activities, China and the Soviet Union have always cooperated closely. We, the Chinese people, are especially grateful to Comrade Stalin and the Soviet government and people for their consistent and sincere help to us.

　　The Soviet Union has consistently fought for the legitimate representation rights of our People's Republic of China in the United Nations. After the United States directly invaded Korea and China's territory of Taiwan last June, the Soviet Union has consistently supported the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against the American aggressors.

　　Thanks to the persistent struggle of the Soviet Union, our two lawsuits accusing the United States of armed aggression against China's territory Taiwan and accusing American aircraft of bombing China's territory were successively included in the agenda by the Security Council on August 28th and 31st last year. The Soviet Union also spoke out for justice in the United Nations General Assembly, proposing a lawsuit against the United States for invading China. This proposal was also included in the agenda by the United Nations General Assembly on November 24th last year. Our representative was invited to attend the Security Council on November 28th last year to accuse the United States of its crimes of aggression against China. Although these three proposals were illegally rejected due to the manipulation of the United States, the United States's crimes of aggression have been further exposed, and the Chinese people's just voice has spread to the world.

　　When the United States and other six countries submitted a proposal to the Security Council on November 10th last year to slander the volunteer actions of the Chinese people, the Soviet representative sternly condemned the United States aggressors for their behavior of reversing right and wrong, and vetoed the slanderous proposal submitted by the United States and other six countries on November 30th last year. Subsequently, the Soviet representatives in the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council refuted the two deceptive resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 14th last year and January 13th this year. According to the measures recommended by these resolutions to adopt a ceasefire first and then negotiate, the American aggressor troops in Korea will get a chance to breathe in order to continue their armed intervention in Korea. At the same time, the Soviet representative actively supported the four proposals put forward by our government to the United Nations on January 17th this year regarding a genuine peaceful solution to the Korean issue and other Far Eastern issues.

　　At the critical juncture of the Korean people's war against the US, the Chinese people stepped forward and aided our fraternal neighbor Korea with voluntary action. The Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, together with the Korean People's Army, quickly routed the American aggressor troops and the Korean traitor Li Chengwan's bandit troops who had invaded near the Chinese border, eliminating more than 60,000 of them, liberating most of the Korean territory, and inflicting serious defeats on the arrogant American aggressors. Under these circumstances, the American aggressors manipulated and hijacked the United Nations General Assembly on February 1st this year to pass a proposal slandering the Chinese people as "aggressors". But this base slander that reverses black and white cannot remedy the American aggressor's fate of complete failure in Korea; on the contrary, this only further strengthens the Chinese people's determination to completely defeat the American aggressors with their own actions.

　　There is no doubt that, with the sympathy and support of the Soviet Union, the people of various people's democratic countries, and the people of other countries in the world, and thanks to the existence of the great Sino-Soviet alliance, we Chinese people and the Korean people will certainly be able to completely defeat the American aggression, thereby consolidating peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people have firm confidence in defeating the US imperialists' aggression and threats against China, because behind them stands the selfless support of their great ally - the powerful Soviet Union.

　　In the past year, China and the Soviet Union have also united as one to fight against the US tearing up international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, rearm Japan, shield and release Japanese war criminals, support the resurgence of Japanese militarist aggressive forces, and turn Japan into a military base for attacking China, the Soviet Union, and various Asian countries; China and the Soviet Union will continue to fight for this in the future in order to strive for the realization of the goal stipulated in Article 2 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and safeguard the security and peace of China and the Soviet Union and the Far East.

　　The provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance regarding the implementation of friendly economic mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union have also been implemented in the past year. The agreement on the Soviet Union lending 300 million US dollars to the People's Republic of China within five years from last year, which was signed at the same time as the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the exchange of notes between the governments of the two countries on the same day, and the agreement between China and the Soviet Union on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian regarding the Soviet Union's transfer to the Chinese government free of charge of the property temporarily leased or managed by the Soviet side in Dalian City, the property obtained by the Soviet economic organs in Northeast China from Japanese owners, and all the real estate of the former Beijing Barracks, the three agreements between China and the Soviet Union on the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Joint Stock Company, the Sino-Soviet Non-ferrous and Rare Metal Joint Stock Company, and the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company signed in March last year, and the agreement between China and the Soviet Union on trade, exchange of goods, and the Soviet Union supplying China with various construction experts in 1950 signed in April last year have all been implemented.

　　The various economic assistance given to China by the Soviet Union in the above-mentioned agreements has played a great role in the Chinese people's rapid healing of the wounds of war and the restoration of industrial and agricultural production and transportation.

　　People can see how miserably the attempt of the imperialist aggression camp headed by the United States to trap the Chinese revolution to death with economic blockade or to force the Chinese people to bow to imperialism has gone bankrupt. Just like on the military and political fronts, the hardworking and brave Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, have also achieved brilliant victories on the economic construction front. Last year, China's agricultural output was close to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The production of China's most important existing industrial textile industry has exceeded the 1936 output by 14 percent. The production of China's heavy industry is also rapidly recovering. Last year, the output level of pig iron was 11.4 times that of 1949, steel was 7.8 times, cement was 3.8 times, and various mechanical products also reached more than three times the 1949 level. Last year, more than 22,000 kilometers of railways were opened to traffic across the country, and for the first time there was a unified and complete transportation plan for the whole country. All this is inseparable from the great assistance of the Soviet Union.

　　According to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union have also become closer in the past year. The Chinese people are enthusiastically learning from the advanced experience and examples of the Soviet people. In China, translating and publishing Soviet books and works has become a craze. In China, translating and publishing Soviet books and works has become a craze. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its branches alone published more than 100 kinds of books introducing the Soviet Union last year. More than 300 kinds of Soviet literary works have been translated and published in the past year. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its branches have published 38 kinds of publications introducing the Soviet Union and supporting Sino-Soviet friendship, of which 19 kinds have sold more than one million copies. From October to December 1949, the mass activities to welcome the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, and celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday, based on statistics from only 45 cities, had more than 2.86 million participants. The picture exhibitions introducing the Soviet Union held throughout the country were attended by millions of viewers. Soviet films depicting the struggles and construction of the Soviet people have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. In Northeast China alone, from October 1949 to September 1950, more than 2.29 million viewers attended film evenings to watch Soviet films. As of November last year, the total number of members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association had exceeded 3.31 million, becoming one of the largest mass organizations in China.

　　In June last year, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "The new Sino-Soviet treaty with great historical significance has consolidated the friendly relations between the two countries, enabling us to let go and carry out domestic construction work faster, and at the same time, it is promoting the great struggle of the people of the world to fight for peace and democracy and oppose war and oppression." The development of events in China and the world in the past year has fully proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion. Now everyone can see that the friendly alliance between the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, which have more than one-third of the total population of mankind, has become the strongest fortress for the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp to resist the war and aggression policies of imperialists and warmongers.

　　The great Lenin wrote as early as 1923: "The outcome of the struggle depends, in the final analysis, on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., constitute the overwhelming majority of the world's population. It is precisely this majority of the world's population that has been very rapidly drawn into the struggle for its own liberation in recent years, so in this sense, there can be no doubt about the final solution to the problem of the world struggle. So in this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed." (Lenin: "Better Fewer, But Better")

　　Now that the Chinese people's revolution has been victorious, the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union have formed a close-knit friendly alliance, and the people of all countries in the world, including the Asian countries, are striving for their own liberation with a hundredfold effort, Lenin's testament is becoming a reality day by day.

　　Molotov was absolutely right when he said in his speech to the voters on March 10th last year: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February has transformed Sino-Soviet friendship into a great and powerful force in the cause of consolidating world peace, a force that has no comparison in human history, past or present."

　　No matter what means of intimidation and struggle the imperialists and warmongers who hate the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union adopt, they cannot save their fate of failure and final destruction. The powerful alliance of the people of China and the Soviet Union is invincible, and the forces of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are invincible.

　　中苏友好同盟一年来的伟大成就
　　吴玉章
    编者按：本文系吴玉章同志为《争取持久和平！争取人民民主!》报而作，已在该报二月十六日第一一九期上发表。
    中国人民正在热烈地庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的一周年。
    中苏两国人民的深厚友谊是久已存在的。自伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后苏联立国的一天起，直到一九四九年十月中华人民共和国成立，苏联人民在伟大的列宁和斯大林的领导下始终一贯地援助了中国人民的解放事业。毛泽东同志在一九四九年十二月十六日抵达莫斯科时在车站上的演说中指出：“十月社会主义革命之后，苏维埃政府根据列宁斯大林的政策首先废除了帝俄时代对于中国的不平等条约。在差不多三十年的时间内，苏联人民和苏联政府又曾几次援助了中国人民的解放事业。中国人民在患难中，得到苏联人民和苏联政府这种兄弟般的友谊，是永远不会忘记的。”在庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰的祝词中，毛泽东同志又说：“中国人民在反抗压迫者的艰苦斗争中，深切地感觉到斯大林同志的友谊的重要性。”
    一九五○年二月十四日签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定的签订，把中苏两国人民间这种早已存在的深厚友谊和团结用条约的形式巩固下来了。而这种友谊和团结，对于全世界和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利，是有着极大影响的。
    这个条约宣布：中苏两国共同制止日本或在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家再起侵略和破坏和平，并促成全面的对日和约的尽早缔结。两国中之任何一国如果遭受日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭，因而处于战争状态时，两国中之另一国即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。
    这个条约宣布：中苏两国愿意忠诚合作，积极参加以确保世界和平与安全为目的之一切国际活动，保证为实现这个目的充分贡献其力量，并在有关两国共同利益的一切重大国际问题上彼此协商。
    最后，这个条约宣布：两国相互保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展与巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作。
    这些就是中苏友好同盟互助条约的主要内容。由此可见，这个条约的签订，已使我们中国有了在自己的历史上从未有过的极为强大的同盟国，因而就巩固了中国人民已经取得的革命胜利，并极大地加强了以苏联为首的世界和平、民主和社会主义力量，因为增加了远东和世界和平的保障。
    一年来，结成友好同盟的中苏两大国，并肩地保卫世界和平，赢得了很大的胜利。
    在一切国际活动中，中苏两国是始终密切地合作的。我们中国人民特别感谢斯大林同志和苏联政府和人民始终给予我们的忠诚帮助。
    苏联始终为我们中华人民共和国在联合国的合法代表权利而斗争。在去年六月美国直接侵略朝鲜及中国领土台湾之后，苏联又始终不渝地声援了中朝人民反抗美国侵略者的正义斗争。
    由于苏联的坚持斗争，我国控诉美国武装侵略中国领土台湾及控诉美国飞机轰炸中国领土的两个控诉案，先后于去年八月二十八日及三十一日由安理会通过列入议程。苏联并在联合国大会中仗义执言，提出控诉美国侵略中国案。这一提案亦被联合国大会于去年十一月二十四日列入议程。我国代表乃于去年十一月二十八日应邀出席安理会控诉了美国侵略中国的罪恶。虽然，由于美国的操纵，这三个议案都被非法地否决，但美国的侵略罪行已进一步地被揭露，中国人民正义的呼声也传布到了全世界。
    当美国等六国在去年十一月十日向安理会提出诽谤中国人民的志愿行动的提案以后，苏联代表又对美国侵略者这种颠倒是非的行为加以严正斥责，并于去年十一月三十日否决了美国等六国所提出的诽谤案。此后，苏联在联合国大会及安理会的代表，又驳斥了去年十二月十四日及今年一月十三日联合国大会所通过的两次欺骗性的决议。按照这些决议所建议采取的先停战后谈判的措施，美国在朝鲜的侵略军将取得喘息机会，以便继续进行对朝鲜的武装干涉。同时，苏联代表积极支持我国政府于今年一月十七日向联合国提出的关于真正和平解决朝鲜问题及其他远东问题的四项建议。
    中国人民在朝鲜人民抗美战争的严重关头，挺身而出，用志愿的行动援助了我们邻邦朝鲜的兄弟。中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，迅速地击溃了侵至中国边境附近的美国侵略军和朝鲜的卖国贼李承晚匪军，消灭其六万余人，解放了朝鲜的大部分国土，使狂妄的美国侵略者受到了严重的失败。在这种情况下，美国侵略者于今年二月一日操纵和劫持联合国大会通过了诽谤中国人民为“侵略者”的提案。但是这种颠倒黑白的卑污的诽谤，并不能补救美国侵略者在朝鲜彻底失败的命运，相反地，这只是更加坚定了中国人民以自己的行动彻底地击败美国侵略者的决心。
    毫无疑义，由于有着苏联、各人民民主国家和世界其他国家的人民的同情和声援，由于伟大的中苏同盟的存在，我们中国人民和朝鲜人民必能完全打垮美国的侵略，从而巩固远东和世界的和平。中国人民有着坚强的信心去击败美帝国主义者对于中国的侵略和威胁，因为在他们的后面站着伟大的同盟者——强大苏联的毫不自私的支援。
    一年来，中苏两国又曾团结一致地为着反对美国撕毁开罗宣言，波茨坦公告等国际协议，企图单独对日媾和、实行重新武装日本，庇护和释放日本战犯，扶植日本军国主义侵略势力再起，变日本为进攻中国、苏联和亚洲各国的军事基地的罪恶阴谋而斗争，中苏两国今后仍将继续为此斗争，以争取为中苏友好同盟互助条约第二条所规定的缔结全面的对日和约的目标的实现，保障中苏两国和远东的安全与和平。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约中关于中苏两国实行友好的经济互助合作的规定，一年来亦已实施。与中苏友好同盟互助条约同时签订的关于自去年起的五年内苏联贷款三亿美元给中华人民共和国的协定，同日两国政府的换文及中苏关于中国长春铁路旅顺口及大连的协定中关于苏联将大连市苏联方面临时租用或代管的财产、苏联经济机关在东北得自日本所有者手中取得的财产和过去北京兵营的全部房产无偿地移交中国政府的规定，去年三月间签订的中苏关于创办中苏石油股份公司、中苏有色金属及稀有金属股份公司、中苏民用航空股份公司的三个协定，去年四月间签订的中苏一九五○年贸易、交换货物及苏联以各种建设专家供给中国等协定，都已经加以实施。
    苏联在上述协定中给予中国的各种经济援助，对于中国人民迅速地医好战争的创伤和恢复工农业生产和交通事业，都起了很大的作用。
    人们可以看得见：以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营想拿经济封锁的办法来困死中国革命，或者迫使中国人民向帝国主义屈膝的打算，是多么悲惨地破产了。正像在军事和政治战线上一样，勤劳而勇敢的中国人民，在毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在苏联的援助下，在经济建设的战线上也获得了辉煌的胜利。去年中国的农业产量已接近抗日战争前的水平。中国现有的最主要的工业纺织工业的生产量已超过一九三六年产量百分之十四。中国重工业的生产也正在迅速恢复起来，去年生铁的产量水平为一九四九年的十一点四倍，钢为七点八倍，水泥为三点八倍，各种机械产品也达到一九四九年水平的三倍以上。去年全国已有二万二千余公里铁路通车，并第一次地有了全国统一的完整的运输计划。所有这一切，都是与苏联的伟大援助分不开的。
    根据中苏友好同盟互助条约的规定，在过去一年中，中苏两国的文化关系也更加密切了。中国人民热情地学习苏联人民的先进经验和榜样。在中国，翻译和出版苏联的书籍和作品，已形成热潮。介绍苏联的书籍，仅中苏友好协会及其分会去年出版的，就有一百多种。苏联的文学作品，去年一年已翻译出版了三百多种。中苏友好协会及其分会出版的介绍苏联和拥护中苏友好的刊物已达三十八种，其中的十九种即销行了一百多万份。在一九四九年十月至十二月间，参加欢迎苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团，庆祝十月革命三十二周年和庆祝斯大林七十寿辰的群众活动的，只就四十五个城市的统计，就有二百八十六万余人。在全国各地举办的介绍苏联的图片展览会，观众以数百万计。描绘苏联人民的斗争和建设情况的苏联电影片，受到中国人民的热烈欢迎。仅东北一地，自一九四九年十月至一九五○年九月，出席电影晚会看苏联影片的观众，就有二百二十九万多人。截至去年十一月份，中苏友好协会的会员总数已超过三百三十一万人，成为中国最大的群众团体之一。
    去年六月间，毛泽东同志在中国共产党的中央委员会全体会议上曾经指出：“具有伟大历史意义的新的中苏条约，巩固了两国的友好关系，一方面使我们能够放手地和较快地进行国内的建设工作，一方面又正在推动着全世界人民争取和平和民主反对战争和压迫的伟大斗争。”一年来中国和世界的事变的发展，完全证明了毛泽东同志这个论断的正确性。现在谁都看得见：有着占全人类总数三分之一以上的人民的中苏两大国的友好同盟，已经成为全世界和平、民主和社会主义阵营抵抗帝国主义者和战争贩子们的战争和侵略政策的最坚强堡垒了。
    伟大的列宁早在一九二三年就写过：“斗争的结局，归根到底是取决于俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形。正是这世界人口的大多数，最近几年来也非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上讲来，关于世界斗争问题的最终解决，不能有丝毫的怀疑。所以在这个意义上讲来，社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有了保证的。”（列宁：“宁肯少些，但要好些”）
    在中国人民革命已经胜利、中苏两大国已经结成亲密无间的友好同盟，而世界各国包括亚洲各国的人民又正在以百倍的努力争取自身解放的现在，列宁的遗言正在一天一天地变为现实。
    去年三月十日，莫洛托夫同志在向选举人的演说中，说得完全正确：“在二月中签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约使中苏友谊在巩固全世界和平的事业上变成为伟大而强大的力量，这个力量在人类历史上过去和现在都没有可以和它相比拟的。”
    仇视中华人民共和国和苏联的帝国主义者和战争贩子们无论采取何种恫吓和挣扎的手段，都不能挽救他们的失败和最后灭亡的命运，中苏两国人民的强大同盟是不可战胜的，以苏联为首的、团结无间的世界和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量是不可战胜的。
