Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: The All-China Youth Federation, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Students' Federation today jointly issued a notice regarding the commemoration of the Day of Struggle Against Colonialism. The full text of the notice is as follows:

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students call on all youth and students around the world to commemorate February 21st – “Day of Struggle Against Colonialism,” to strengthen the struggle of youth worldwide against imperialist aggression and to defend world peace, and to express active support for the struggle of youth and students in colonial and semi-colonial countries for independence and freedom. We warmly respond to this movement and call on all youth and students across the country to greet this day of struggle with active actions.

    This year, when Chinese youth commemorate the Day of Struggle Against Colonialism, it coincides with the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army achieving brilliant victories in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the movement of the Chinese people to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, and oppose the armed revival of Japan entering a climax. Today, the most practical action for us Chinese youth to oppose colonialism is to continue to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea waged by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, to unite all peace-loving youth in Japan and Eastern countries, to strive for a reasonable and just comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, to crush the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to turn Japan into its tool of aggression in Asia, to support the youth of all Eastern nations in their struggle for liberation, and to eliminate the remaining influence of imperialism in China.

    Therefore, this year's February 21st commemorative activities should further deepen ideological education on patriotism and internationalism on the basis of the movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, and oppose the rearmament of Japan, and strengthen propaganda work in this regard. To this end, we must point out the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and that only a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan including the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union is a guarantee of peace in the East, and that only a democratic, non-militaristic Japan is the common demand of the Japanese people and the peoples and youth of Asian countries. We must publicize the great significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution to the liberation struggle of the oppressed people around the world, especially in the East, publicize the brilliant victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Forces in defeating U.S. imperialism, publicize the increasingly powerful anti-imperialist armed struggles of various Eastern nations, publicize the contribution of the colonial people's struggle to the defense of world peace, and publicize the sympathy and support of democratic youth around the world for colonial youth. And call on all Chinese youth to unite and support the World Federation of Democratic Youth in protesting the unreasonable measures of the reactionary French government to close the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth and other three democratic organizations.

    When commemorating February 21st, the following methods should be appropriately adopted to carry out commemorative activities in conjunction with local conditions:

    1. Before February 21st, conduct various publicity activities through newspapers, youth publications, wall newspapers, radio broadcasts, singing, lectures, art performances, etc., in conjunction with the movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, and oppose the rearmament of Japan.

    2. On the Day of Struggle Against Colonialism or a few days before, hold commemorative gatherings of various forms in factories, schools, government agencies, and other units. At the meeting, some recreational programs combined with the content and requirements of the commemoration can be organized. Representative gatherings can be organized in larger cities.

    3. Depending on the specific circumstances, youth can be mobilized to write letters in the name of individuals or all youth in factories and schools to youth in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, or other countries who are fighting against imperialism. If possible, combat heroes and labor models can be organized to write letters. The letters should be sent to Beijing in mid-February for forwarding abroad.

    Please inform us of the preparation and activity situation in various places in a timely manner.

　　全国青联、青年团中央及全国学联联合通知       
    纪念反对殖民制度斗争日
    【新华社八日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国学生联合会今日联名发布关于纪念反对殖民制度斗争日的通知。通知全文如下：
    世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会号召全世界青年、学生纪念二月二十一日——“反对殖民制度斗争日”，以加强全世界青年反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争，并表示积极支援殖民地、半殖民地国家青年、学生争取独立自由的斗争。我们热烈地响应这一运动，号召全国青年和学生以积极行动来迎接这一斗争日。
    今年中国青年纪念反对殖民制度斗争日的时候，正值中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜抗美战争中取得辉煌胜利，中国人民抗美援朝和反对武装日本的运动进入高潮的时候。在今天，我们中国青年反对殖民制度最实际的行动，就是要继续支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的抗美战争，就是要团结日本与东方各国一切爱好和平的青年，为争取合理公正的对日全面和约，粉碎美帝国主义使日本成为它在亚洲的侵略工具的阴谋而斗争，就是要支援东方各民族青年为争取自己解放而斗争，就是要肃清帝国主义在中国的残余影响而斗争。
    因此，今年二月二十一日的纪念活动应在抗美援朝、反对重新武装日本这一运动的基础上，进一步深入爱国主义和国际主义的思想教育，加强在这方面的宣传工作。为此，我们要指出美帝国主义单独对日媾和的阴谋，只有包括中华人民共和国和苏联参加的对日全面和约才是东方和平的保证，只有民主的非军国主义的日本才是日本人民及亚洲各国人民与青年的共同要求。我们要宣传中国革命胜利对全世界特别是对东方被压迫人民解放斗争的伟大意义，宣传朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队击败美帝国主义的辉煌胜利，宣传东方各民族日益强大的反帝武装斗争，宣传殖民地人民斗争对保卫世界和平的贡献，宣传全世界民主青年对殖民地青年的同情与支援。并号召全中国青年一致起来支援世界民主青年联盟抗议反动的法国政府封闭世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会及世界民主青年联盟等三民主组织的无理措施。
    在纪念二月二十一日时，应结合各地情况，适当地采取以下的方式来进行纪念活动：
    一、在二月二十一日前，通过报纸、青年刊物、墙报、广播、歌咏、讲演艺术表演等方式，结合抗美援朝、反对重新武装日本运动进行各种宣传活动。
    二、在反对殖民制度斗争日或前数天，分别在工厂、学校、机关等单位举行各种形式的纪念集会。会上可组织一些与纪念内容和要求相结合的文娱节目。较大的城市可组织代表性的集会。
    三、根据具体情况，可以动员青年以个人或工厂、学校全体青年的名义写信给朝鲜、日本、越南或其他为反对帝国主义而奋斗的青年，如有可能，可组织战斗英雄、劳动模范写信。信件要在二月中旬寄到北京，再转发国外。
    各地筹备和活动情况希及时告诉我们。
