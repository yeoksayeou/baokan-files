Xinhua News Agency, 19th: According to delayed news from Singapore: The Fifth and Eighth Detachments of the Malayan National Liberation Army, active in the states of Perak and Kedah in northern Malaya, have been fighting bravely against the British colonial army with the active support of the Malayan people, and have achieved major victories. The combined results of these two detachments up to June 1950 are as follows:

In Perak, the Fifth Detachment of the Malayan National Liberation Army, in the two years from June 1948 to June 1950, killed, wounded, and captured a total of 480 British military police, seized one mortar, 36 shells, four light machine guns, 110 various types of firearms, 4,289 rounds of ammunition, and a large quantity of military supplies. In the surprise attacks to disrupt transportation lines, the detachment destroyed 15 sections of railway, five locomotives, 17 carriages, one railway station, and 16 highway bridges. The detachment also confiscated 1,801 acres of rubber plantations from reactionary capitalists and temporarily distributed them to the workers.

In the first half of 1950, the Eighth Detachment of the Malayan National Liberation Army fought 19 battles against British troops and police, killing or wounding a total of 104 British military police, and seizing two machine guns, 64 rifles and a large amount of ammunition. In its activities to disrupt transportation lines, the detachment destroyed 12 sections of railway, two locomotives, and 12 carriages. In the battles, the casualty ratio between the British colonial military police and the Malayan National Liberation Army was slightly less than four to one, and the weapon loss ratio was more than eight to one.

Note: At the end of 1949, the British colonial army in Malaya launched the so-called "key offensive"; in February 1950, it mobilized a large number of military police and launched the so-called "anti-bandit month." With the enthusiastic support of the Malayan people, the Malayan National Liberation Army carried out heroic battles, crushed this series of offensives by the British colonial army, and strengthened its ranks in the fighting.

　　马来亚北部解放军两个支队
    连续获得重大战果
    【新华社十九日讯】据新加坡迟到消息：活跃在马来亚北部霹雳州和吉打州的马来亚民族解放军第五支队与第八支队，在马来亚人民的积极支援下，对英国殖民军英勇作战，获得了重大战果。该两支队到一九五○年六月为止的综合战果如下：
    在霹雳州的马来亚民族解放军第五支队在一九四八年六月至一九五○年六月两年内共击毙、击伤和俘虏英国军警四百八十名，缴获迫击炮一门、炮弹三十六发、轻机关枪四挺、各式枪械一百一十枝、子弹四千二百八十九发和军用物资一大批。该支队在破坏交通干线的突击战中，摧毁了铁路十五段、机车五台、车厢十七辆、火车站一所和公路桥梁十六座。该支队并没收了反动资本家的橡胶园一千八百零一英亩，将它暂时分配给工人。
    马来亚民族解放军第八支队在一九五○年上半年半年中，与英国军队和警察共作战十九次，共毙伤英国军警一○四名，缴获机关枪二挺，长短枪六十四枝和大量弹药。该支队在破坏交通线的活动中，摧毁了铁路十二段、机车二台、车厢十二辆。在战斗中，英殖民军警与马来亚民族解放军的伤亡比例为四比一弱，武器损失为八比一强。
    按：一九四九年年底，马来亚英国殖民军发动了所谓“重点进攻”；一九五○年二月，又调动大批军警、发动了所谓“反匪月”。马来亚民族解放军在马来亚人民的热烈支援下，进行了英勇的战斗，粉碎了英国殖民军的这一连串进攻，并在战斗中壮大了自己的队伍。
