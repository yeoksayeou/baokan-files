　　Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Continues to Break New Records
　　Following the Steelmaking Department's creation of eight new records in seven days, the Ironmaking Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has also continuously set five new records in the first half of this year. Firstly, thanks to the improvement of the feathering nozzle operation method by foreman Shi Baotong and his fellow workers, the time to replace one nozzle was reduced from 20 minutes to 25 minutes for three. Subsequently, labor model Wang Liechen and his fellow workers successfully researched and tested the reduction of plugging clay machine usage time from the original five minutes to one minute. Coupled with the consistent pace and unified operation of technical cadres in all three shifts, the daily iron production exceeded the blast furnace equipment capacity by 33.4%, creating the first new record since New Year's Day. On the 11th, the Baihelu shift set a new record of 30 batches of charging. Workers in the other two shifts were not to be outdone, and collectively set a new record of 87 batches of charging for the entire day. On the 12th, a new record was also set for iron output. In half a month, the product quality reached 100% open-hearth iron standard, with no sand-casted iron or white iron, creating a new record for ironmaking quality. Currently, the department's employees are working hard to create even higher and more new records.

　　Tianjin Textile Factories Switch to Three-Shift System
　　The six state-owned textile factories in Tianjin, under the North China Textile Administration Bureau, have all completed the switch to a three-shift system by January 22nd, according to the order of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government. In the past, the factories implemented a two-shift system, operating for 20 hours day and night. After switching to the three-shift system, the operating hours increased to 23 hours, and the total weekly output of yarn and cloth will increase by 28%. Through the three-shift system, not only has the efficiency of machines been fully utilized and production increased, but also the workers' working hours have been reduced from the original ten hours to eight hours, giving them sufficient time for rest, study, and recreation outside of production labor. Currently, the six factories have also added workers to meet production needs, providing employment for approximately 3,400 unemployed workers.
