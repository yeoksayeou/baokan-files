(By our reporter at the Korean front, January 25th) An American soldier named Henry C. Corner, who invaded Korea, wrote a piece after being captured by a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, describing his capture and his feelings about the lenient treatment he received from the Chinese People's Volunteers. He hoped to communicate with his family and let them know he was doing well, but because he lost the address of his family's new home, he had to go through a friend to convey the message. His friend's name is George Van Luvanee, residing at 312 Twelfth Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The following is a translation of this article.

　　"I cautiously crawled along a ditch beside the road. A sharp pain shot through my right leg. I couldn't remember if I had cried out. But I knew I was injured.

　　I stopped crawling and lay down next to another companion who also seemed to be injured. We lay there for what felt like an eternity—longer than a lifetime—until the fighting subsided a bit. I was cold, scared, and miserable. Eventually, the battle was over, moving far down the mountain.

　　A little while later, a Chinese People's Volunteer came over and took my gun. After he left, I became truly afraid. I had often heard that if I surrendered to the Chinese and Korean forces, I would be mistreated—even shot. Most American soldiers thought so.

　　I now realize that they fabricated these lies to make us fight to the end. So, you can imagine how afraid of death I was at the time!

　　I was in terrible pain, and the other wounded soldier next to me started crying. We tried to comfort him, but it was no use—he was delirious and dying. He couldn't hear anything we said. At this moment, two Chinese soldiers came over to see what was happening. I planned to play dead, but I was so cold and scared that I shook like a leaf. How could a dead man shiver?

　　So, the two Chinese soldiers smiled, helped me up. They half-carried and half-supported me and another wounded soldier to their gathering point on the mountaintop. We thought the worst was probably coming. Upon reaching the top, a soldier ran up to us, shook our hands, and handed us an English booklet stating that we would be treated with leniency and that our personal property would be protected. I felt a little better, but not much, because I was still suspicious.

　　We moved on and gathered more American prisoners of war—more than I expected. The seven of us wounded prisoners were separated from the rest and rode in a car with Chinese wounded soldiers. Early in the morning, we arrived at the hospital, which was located in one or several Korean villages.

　　Immediately, doctors and nurses came, bandaged our wounds, and did everything possible to make us comfortable. After that, breakfast was served. I can hardly imagine how hungry I was! That meal—hot rice, vegetables, and pork—was truly the best meal I had ever had in my life.

　　It wasn't until then that I wasn't afraid at all. I reasoned in my mind, if they were going to kill me, would they treat me so well?

　　In the following days, I learned many things, such as how to roll cigarettes, Chinese customs, a few Chinese words, and what particularly surprised me was that the Chinese did not regard me personally as an enemy.

　　What also surprised me was that all these Chinese people were very happy, believed in their government, and supported it. I had read and especially heard a lot about how the people in the communist countries of the Soviet Union, China, Poland, etc., were oppressed semi-slaves, hated their governments, and would welcome Americans to "liberate" them... Now, I understand that those are lies. However, recognizing this is not enough, and I am prepared to understand more about the new China.

　　One day, a Chinese soldier who knew a little English, lively and lovable, came to talk to me with some paper and a pencil. He first drew a picture, a pitch-black night, a group of ragged people, with a Kuomintang flag hanging above them. Later, he drew another picture, under the flag of the new China, bright sunlight shining on well-dressed, happy working people. From these two pictures and simple words, I knew that the Chinese people did not regard me and our American people as enemies, only the Wall Street financiers and wealthy monopolists were their enemies. I also began to understand that these people were not only the enemies of the Chinese and Korean people but also my enemies!

　　Later, the hospital gave me a set of Chinese-style winter clothes because our own clothes could not withstand the Korean winter. The hospital director came to see us every day. He often brought us tobacco and sometimes snacks, and ordered us to take baths. We liked him very much.

　　The food in the hospital was very good. We ate rice, sometimes bread, and once we even had chicken and fried cakes. What delicious meals!

　　When I had to leave the hospital, I was so sad! I was reluctant to leave those American soldiers whose wounds had not yet healed and the people who had taken such good care of me. But at least I had understood one thing—no matter what the future holds, the people of Korea and China are ultimately not my enemies, and they will treat me well.

　　I think the time spent in the hospital was the most precious. I understand that communism by no means means war and is not oppression. On the contrary, it is the expression of the will of the people; the Chinese people, the Soviet people, the Polish people, the Czech people, and the people of other countries have never planned aggression, nor have they ever hoped for war, but only need to build a beautiful country and live peacefully with all countries in the world.

　　I left the hospital with the hope of learning more about the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and understanding the new working methods of their government—their new way of life."

　　一个被俘美军的自述
    【本报讯】据随我人民志愿军记者一月二十五日自朝鲜前线报道：一个名叫亨利·Ｃ·考尔那（Henry C.Corner）的侵朝美军士兵，被我人民志愿军某部俘获后，过了一个时期，曾写了一篇文字叙述他被俘的经过和受到我人民志愿军的宽待的感想。他希望与家里通信，告诉家里他很好，但由于他遗失了家庭新居的地址，不得不经过一位友人来转达。他的这位朋友名叫乔治·Ｖ·鲁万尼（George Van Luvanee）住在美国宾夕凡尼亚州、费城，第十二市场大街三一二号。下面就是这篇文字的译文。
    “我小心翼翼地沿着公路旁一条沟爬着。右腿一阵阵剧痛。我记不清楚究竟哭叫过没有。但是我明白，我是受伤了。
    我停住不爬了，并且躺下来靠在另外一位看来也像受伤的伙伴的旁边。一直到战事比较缓和一点为止，我们躺在那里不晓得过了多久——简直比过一辈子还长。我是又冷、又怕、又难受。后来，战事终算过去了，它移到远远的山下。
    一小会儿，一位中国人民志愿军走过来，他取走了我的枪。他走后，我才真真地害怕起来了，我常听说，我只要向中朝军队投降，就要被苛待——甚至挨枪毙。大部分美军都这样想。
    我现在才明白，他们这样制造谎言是想叫我们一直作战到最后。因此，你也可以想像得出，当时我是多么地怕死啊！
    我正在苦痛的了不得，而我旁边的另一位伤兵却开始哭叫了。我们想安慰他一下，但是一切安慰都无用——他已经神志昏迷，快死了，我们无论说什么他都听不见。这时，有两位中国士兵过来看看究竟发生了什么事。我打算装死，但是又冷又怕，我像树叶子一样地抖起来了。一个死人怎么会战栗呢？
    所以，那两位中国士兵笑起来了，他们搀我起来。他们将我和另外一个伤兵半扶半抬地运到他们集合的山顶。我们想着，那最糟糕的时间说不定就快来了。到了山顶，一位士兵跑到我们跟前和我们握手，并递给我们一本英文小册子，上面说优待我们并且保障我们私人财产。我好过一点了，但还不太多，因为我仍怀疑。
    我们移动了，又收集了更多的美军战俘——多到令我吃惊。我们七个受伤的俘虏和其余的分开，和中国伤兵一同乘汽车走。一早，我们就到达了医院，这个医院是安置在一个朝鲜村庄或则几个村庄里。
    立刻，大夫护士都来了，给我们包扎伤口，尽一切可能使我们舒适。此后，开早饭。我简直想像不来我是多么饿啊！那一顿饭——热腾腾的大米饭、蔬菜和猪肉——真是我这一辈子里吃过的最好的一餐了。
    直到这时候，我才一点也不害怕了。我这样在心里盘算，假使他们要杀我，他们还会这样优待我吗？
    此后几天里，我学会了不少东西，例如怎样卷纸烟、中国风俗、几句中国话，特别令我吃惊的是中国人不把我个人当作一个敌人看待。
    还有令我吃惊的就是所有这些中国人都非常愉快，相信他们的政府而且拥护它。关于那些说苏联的、中国的、波兰等等共产党国家的人民都是些被压迫的半奴隶，都讨厌他们的政府，而且他们都非常欢迎美国人去“解放”他们的……的话，我曾经读得不少，听得尤其多。现在，我明白了那些是谎话。不过，认识了这些也还不够，我准备多明白些新中国的事。
    一天，一位多少懂得一点英文的中国士兵，他活泼可爱，拿着几张纸和一管铅笔，来和我谈了起来。他先画了一张画，漆黑的夜、一群衣衫褴褛的人，上面挂着一个国民党旗。后来，他又画了一张，在新中国国旗下，明亮的阳光照耀着衣着整齐、愉快的劳动人群。从他这两幅画以及简单的话语里，我知道了中国人民并没有把我和我们美国人民当作敌人，只是那些华尔街财政家以及富有的独占资本家们才是他们的仇敌。我也开始明白这些人，不仅是中国人民和朝鲜人民的而且也是我的仇敌！
    后来，医院给我一身中国式冬衣，因为我们自己的衣服抵御不了朝鲜的寒冬。医院院长每天都来看视我们。他常常给我们带来烟草，有时也带来点心，并命令我们洗澡。我们非常喜欢他。
    医院的伙食很好。我们吃大米，有时吃面包，有一次我们还吃鸡肉和油饼。多么好吃的饭啊！
    当我必须离院时，我是多么难过啊！我舍不得离开那些伤口仍未痊愈的美国大兵们和亲切照顾过我的人们。但是至少我已经明白了一件事——无论前途如何，朝鲜和中国的人民终归不是我的敌人，他们会好好地对待我的。
    我认为在医院中过的这一段时间是最难得的。我明白，共产主义决不意味着战争而且也并不是压迫，相反的，他是人民意志的表现；中国人民、苏联人民、波兰人民、捷克人和其他国家人民也一样，从未计划过侵略，也从未希望过战争，只是需要建设美好的国家，与世界各国和平共处。
    我离开医院时抱着一个希望，要更多地了解中国人民英勇的斗争，了解他们政府的新的工作方法——他们的新的生活方式。”
