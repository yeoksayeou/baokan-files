　　Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Japan Sends Letter to Chinese Workers
　　Declaring Japanese Workers Firmly Oppose Armed Japan
    Welcoming Chinese People to Write Letters Protesting the US Imperialist Plot to Arm Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has received a letter from the Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Japan, dated January 18th, to the Chinese workers. The letter states that Japanese workers firmly demand a comprehensive peace treaty and oppose the rearmament of Japan; and welcomes the Chinese people to write letters protesting the US imperialist plot to rearm Japan and conclude a separate peace treaty. The original text of the letter is as follows:
    Dear Chinese worker comrades:

    In order to assist the Korean people in their struggle for independence and freedom, you have displayed the spirit of fraternal friendship with your neighbor, and volunteered to go to Korea to crush imperialist aggression. We Japanese workers, in addition to expressing our heartfelt admiration for the heroic actions of your volunteers, also express our sincere gratitude for your constant enthusiastic encouragement and assistance to us Japanese workers.

    At present, the US imperialists are using Japan as a military base to forcibly invade Korea, and are further attempting to use it to invade the Soviet Union, China and other countries. The imperialist devils vainly attempt to fully implement their conspiracy, colluding with Japanese reactionaries to rearm Japan and turn Japanese workers and farmers into their cannon fodder. Japanese workers are now subjected to colonial low wages, hard labor, and slave-like lives.

    However, no matter how the enemy conceals the truth, the Japanese working class now clearly knows who the real enemy is, and is launching a struggle against the oppression of the imperialist aggressors, against the rearmament of Japan, and for independence, peace, and improved living standards. The glorious victory of your country's working class in defeating foreign imperialist aggression has given the Japanese working class great strength and encouraged our confidence in victory. Your country's great victory has greatly excited us Japanese workers. We firmly demand a comprehensive peace treaty including the Soviet Union and New China, and struggle for independence, peace, and improved living standards.

    War-monger Dulles is coming to Japan again with the sinister schemes of rearming Japan and concluding a separate peace treaty. At this time, if your brothers can send protest letters, it will greatly encourage the Japanese workers' struggle against the rearmament of Japan, and raise their fighting spirit and courage.

    Immediately withdraw all foreign troops from Korea!

    Withdraw foreign troops from all colonies and occupied territories!

    Long live the unity of Chinese and Japanese workers!

    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

                                      Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Japan
                                  January 18, 1951

    Note: The Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Japan was organized last September by various progressive trade unions in Japan after the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council, a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, was illegally dissolved, to maintain contact with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　日世界工联联络事务局致函我国工人
　　声明日工人坚决反对武装日本
    欢迎我国人民写信抗议美帝武装日本的阴谋
    【新华社十五日讯】中华全国总工会顷接到日本世界工联联络事务局一月十八日致中国工人的信。该信声明日本工人坚决要求全面媾和，反对重新武装日本；并欢迎中国人民写信抗议美帝国主义重新武装日本与单独媾和的阴谋。该信原文如下：敬爱的中国工人同志们：
    你们为了援助朝鲜人民争取独立自由的斗争，发挥邻邦的友爱精神，纷纷志愿到朝鲜去，粉碎帝国主义的侵略。我们日本工人除了向你们志愿军的英勇行动表示满腔敬意外，并对你们不断地给我们日本工人以热烈的鼓励和援助，表示衷心的感谢。
    现在，美帝国主义者以日本为军事基地，强行侵略朝鲜，并更进一步企图用来侵略苏联、中国及其他各国。帝国主义鬼子们妄想全部实行他们的阴谋，勾结日本反动派，重新武装日本，要把日本工人与农民充当他们的炮灰。现在日本工人已受到殖民地的低工资、苦役劳动和奴隶的生活。
    但是，不管敌人怎样掩饰他们的真相，日本工人阶级现在已经明确地知道了真正的敌人是谁，并为反对帝国主义侵略者的压迫，反对从新武装日本，要求独立和平和改善生活，而展开了斗争。贵国工人阶级打败了外国帝国主义的侵略，得到光辉的胜利，这给予日本工人阶级以巨大的力量，并鼓舞了我们的胜利信心。贵国的巨大胜利使我们日本工人倍增兴奋，我们坚决要求包括苏联与新中国的全面媾和，为独立、和平和改善生活而斗争。
    战争贩子杜勒斯带着重新武装日本和单独媾和的阴谋鬼计，又要来日本了。在这时候，贵国兄弟如能寄来抗议的信，将大大鼓励日本工人反对重新武装日本的斗争，并提高他们的斗争情绪和勇气。
    立即撤退一切在朝鲜的外国军队！
    从一切殖民地和占领地撤出外国军队！
    中国与日本工人团结万岁！
    世界工联万岁！
                                      日本世界工联联络事务局
                                  一九五一年一月十八日
    按：日本世界工联联络事务局是在世界工联会员全日工会联络协议会被非法解散后，日本各进步工会于去年九月间决议组织起来的，继续保持与世界工联的联系。
