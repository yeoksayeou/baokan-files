    Houqikuang Village, Muping County, a mountain village by the sea in Shandong, is the hometown of Lü Songshan, a solo hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. His glorious deeds of bravely capturing more than 30 American soldiers on the Korean front have been spread throughout the villages around Lü Songshan's village. Young people have turned the hero's story into songs and sing them everywhere: "Under the rain of bullets, single man and horse! Capturing more than 30 American soldiers, a solo hero! His fame spreads all over the world."
    The Spring Festival has arrived, and the people of Lü Songshan's hometown are busy celebrating this great happy event. On the day of the celebration meeting, the village was like a wedding, the children were all dressed in new colorful clothes, the women were dressed neatly and cleanly, and Lü Songshan's uncle (Lü Songshan lost his father at a young age and was raised by his uncle) Uncle Lü Huichang also put on a new cotton robe and wore the velvet hat that he was always reluctant to wear. People from all directions came to celebrate like attending a fair, flocking to the hero's village. There were waist drum teams, yangko teams, lantern teams, and militia teams performing various acrobatics depicting the heroic battles of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies. The long line stretched from the west end of the village to the east end. They all brought gifts for the hero's family, such as fatty meat, chicken, cabbage, and apples. The county magistrate personally led a delegation from the County People's Government, carrying a glorious plaque with the four golden characters "Solo Hero" and a glorious umbrella, to specially congratulate them. The people present were all inspired by the honor and expressed their opinions one after another. Lü Qizhi, a representative from Qikuang Village, proudly said: "This is an honor that our village has never had in its history." He read the letter from the people of the whole village to Lü Songshan, which read: "With you and countless heroes of the Chinese and Korean People's Army, we have full confidence to defeat the aggression of American imperialism. Our village's land reform has ended, and land and houses have been distributed to you. You can rest assured to fight the American devils on the Korean front."
    After the meeting, amidst the whistling sea breeze, the sound of gongs and drums and singing resounded again, and various recreational programs were performed to celebrate the hero's achievements. People said that this was the happiest Spring Festival in Houqikuang Village.

　　记独胆英雄吕松山家乡春节庆功大会
　　包慧
    山东海滨一个山庄——牟平县后七夼村，这是中国人民志愿军独胆英雄吕松山的家乡。他在朝鲜前线英勇地活捉三十多个美国兵的光荣事迹，已经被吕松山村里的人传遍了四乡。年轻人把英雄的故事编成歌子到处唱着：“枪林弹雨下，单人独马呀！活捉美兵三十多，独胆英雄呀！美名天下扬。”
    春节到了，吕松山家乡的人们，都忙着庆贺这件大喜事。开庆功大会的这天，村内像办喜事一样，儿童们都穿上了新的花衣服，妇女们打扮得整齐清洁，吕松山的叔父（吕松山从小丧父，叔父把他抚养长大）吕会昌老大爷也换上了新棉袍，戴上从来舍不得戴的丝绒帽。四乡来庆贺的人们像赶集会一样地涌往英雄的村庄。有腰鼓队、秧歌队、花灯队，有扮演着中朝人民军队英勇作战等各种活报杂耍的民兵队。长长的行列，从庄西头排到庄东头。他们都带有肥肉、鸡、白菜、苹果等送给英雄家属的贺礼。县长亲自率领县人民政府代表团，携着缀了“独胆英雄”四个金字的光荣匾和光荣伞特地赶来祝贺。到会的人们，都被荣誉鼓舞起来了，纷纷发表意见。从七夼村代表吕其志自豪地说：“这是咱村历史上从来没有的光荣。”他读了全村人民给吕松山的信，信上写着：“有了你和中朝人民部队无数的英雄，我们完全有信心打败美帝国主义的侵略，咱庄土地改革已经结束，给你分了土地和房子，你可放心在朝鲜前线打美国鬼子。”
    会后在海风呼啸声中又响起了锣鼓声、歌唱声，表演着各种为庆贺英雄功绩的游艺节目，人们都说这是后七夼村最快乐的一个春节。
