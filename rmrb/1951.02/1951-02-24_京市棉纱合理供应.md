Beijing Municipality Rationally Supplies Cotton Yarn
[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing News Agency, since the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government promulgated the decision on the unified purchase of cotton yarn on January 4, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company have conducted inspections and registrations of various yarn-using industries and launched a comprehensive and planned supply to ensure industrial yarn use and stabilize yarn prices. At present, the raw material problems of the city's seven industries, including weaving and dyeing, knitting, rubber, carpets, electric wires, cordage, and braid, have been completely resolved.

Before the unified purchase of cotton yarn was decided, during the three months of October, November, and December of last year, due to increased purchasing power among the people and increased consumption of yarn and cloth, some speculators took the opportunity to hoard and speculate, driving up yarn prices. This disrupted the normal circulation process of production, transportation, and sales, causing supply and demand imbalances and seriously affecting industrial production that used yarn as a raw material. Since the unified purchase of cotton yarn, the production and use of cotton yarn can be planned and allocated nationwide, thoroughly solving the problem of yarn sources. Industrial figures in Beijing Municipality's yarn-using industries held a forum at the Federation of Industry and Commerce on January 11, unanimously and enthusiastically supporting the government's decision on the unified purchase of cotton yarn. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce then formulated a city-wide yarn usage plan according to the normal production needs of various public and private industries. Larger private factories purchased yarn as individual units, smaller factories were grouped into teams, and smaller industries were handled as individual industries, with purchase certificates issued. Public factories formulated plans and purchased yarn directly from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company after approval by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. All public and private factories that have processing and exchange relationships with Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Department Store, and Trust Companies directly received raw materials from these companies. By the end of January, all the work had been completed, and the rational allocation and supply of yarn had begun.

　　京市棉纱合理供应
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：自一月四日中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会颁布了统购棉纱的决定后，北京市人民政府工商局，和中国花纱布公司北京市公司，即对各用纱行业，进行审查登记，展开全面的、有计划的供应，保证了工业用纱，稳定了纱价。现在全市织染、针织、橡胶、地毯、电线、合线、绦带等七个行业的原料问题，已获得全部解决。
    当统购棉纱的决定没有颁布前，在去年十月、十一月、十二月这三个月内，因人民购买力提高，纱布消费量增加，一些投机分子，便乘机囤积倒把，高抬纱价，使得产、运、销正常的流转过程脱节，供求失常，严重地影响了以纱为原料的工业生产。自从统购棉纱以后，在全国范围内，棉纱的生产和使用，可以有计划的调配供应，彻底解决了纱源问题。京市生产用纱工业界人士，一月十一日在工商联合会开座谈会，一致热烈拥护政府关于统购棉纱的决定。工商局随即按照各公私营的工业正常生产需要，编制全市用纱计划。私营工厂较大的，以厂为单位，较小的厂子，编成小组，较小的行业，以行业为单位，发证购纱。公营工厂，编造计划，经工商局批准后，直接向花纱布公司购纱。各公、私营工厂，凡与花纱布、百货、信托等公司有加工交换关系的，直接向各该公司领取原料。到一月底，已完成了全部工作，开始了合理配销供纱。
