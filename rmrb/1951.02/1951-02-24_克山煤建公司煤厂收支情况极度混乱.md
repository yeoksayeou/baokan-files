　　The Keshan Coal Construction Company Coal Plant's Revenue and Expenditure Situation is Extremely Chaotic
    To the Editor:
    The local masses and various organizations have reported on the Keshan Coal Construction Company Coal Plant shortchanging people when selling coal. Now, let us tell you some specific facts:
    On January 9th, employee representatives from our bank went to the company's coal plant to purchase coal. The coal was delivered directly by the coal plant the next day. As a result, each ton was short approximately 280 to 400 jin. The office immediately negotiated with Manager Wang of the plant, but he shirked responsibility, saying: It was weighed with a coal bucket scale, how could it be short? Even if it is short, we will make it up next time you buy coal! This problem has been dragged on and has not been resolved. On January 31st, the bank purchased another 20 tons of coal from the plant. When it was delivered, there were only 19 tons. After contacting Manager Wang, he did not send anyone to the bank to investigate. The next day, he sent a full cart of coal, which ended up being 160 jin more. According to the person delivering the coal: When we deliver coal, we don't weigh it. Sometimes it's more, sometimes it might be less. In addition, we also know of a transaction with a large quantity difference: On January 18th, the Keshan Distillery purchased 200 tons of Hegang coal from the plant. When more than 100 tons were delivered, the distillery randomly weighed one ton of the delivered coal and found it to be short 260 jin. Immediately, based on the 260 jin shortage per ton, the plant delivered an additional 11 tons. According to investigations, the plant had a "surplus" of 1,489 tons of coal in January. How did all this extra coal come about? This practice is harming the interests of the broad masses of people.

    Editor's Note: Judging from the specific events reflected by readers, the revenue and expenditure situation and accounting system of the Keshan Coal Construction Company Coal Plant are extremely chaotic. At the same time, shortchanging people when selling coal is also a violation of the People's Government's fair and reasonable trade policy. It is hoped that the Coal Construction Company will assist in inspecting and improving its work.

### 克山煤建公司煤厂收支情况极度混乱

　　克山煤建公司煤厂收支情况极度混乱
    编辑同志：
    克山煤建公司煤厂卖煤少给份量的事，当地群众和各机关都有反映。现在让我们将一些具体事实告诉你们：
    一月九日我行职工代表到该公司煤厂购煤，第二天由煤厂直接送来，结果每吨要少二八○斤到四○○斤左右。当即由办事处向该厂王经理交涉，他却推诿说：用煤斗子秤过的，不会少吧！即使少了，等下次再买煤时补给吧！这问题一直被拖下来未得解决。一月三十一日，银行又向该厂购煤二十吨，运到后却只有十九吨，与王经理联络后，他也不派人到银行调查，第二天即用大车满满地装了一车煤来，结果又多出一六○斤。据送煤的人说：“送点煤，我们是不过秤的。有时多点，有时也许少点。”另外，我们还知道一个数量相差很大的一笔交易：一月十八日，克山制酒厂向该厂购鹤岗煤二百吨，在送到一百多吨的时候，制酒厂从运到的煤中抽称了一吨，结果发现少煤二六○斤，当即按每吨二六○斤差额计算，又由该厂补送了十一吨。据调查，该厂在一月份内“节余”煤一四八九吨，这些煤都是怎样多下的呀！这样作法是危害广大人民群众利益的。

    编者按：从读者反映的具体事件来看，克山煤建公司煤厂收支情况和会计制度是极度混乱的；同时卖煤少给份量也是违犯人民政府公平合理的贸易政策的，希煤建公司协助其检查并改进工作。
