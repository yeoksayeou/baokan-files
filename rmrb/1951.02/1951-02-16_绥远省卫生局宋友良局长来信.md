Response to Criticisms in the People's Daily

　　Letter from Song Youliang, Director of the Health Bureau of Suiyuan Province
    Comrade Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 22 published a letter criticizing my undemocratic work style. I will definitely, in accordance with the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," conduct a thorough self-examination. I am about to attend a conference on church-run hospitals convened by the Ministry of Health of the CCP People's Government, which will take two to three weeks. Therefore, I must wait until after the conference, that is, early March, to inform you of the results of my self-examination.
                                        Song Youliang, February 10

　　绥远省卫生局宋友良局长来信
    编辑同志：
    人民日报一月二十二日《读者来信》栏发表了批评我作风不民主的信件。我一定按照中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”的精神，进行彻底检讨。我即将参加中共人民政府卫生部召开的教会医院会议，前后需时两、三个星期，因此，我须在会议完毕后，即三月上旬，才能把检查结果告诉你们。
                                        宋友良  二月十日
