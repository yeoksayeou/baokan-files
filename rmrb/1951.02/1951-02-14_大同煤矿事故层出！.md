Frequent Accidents at Datong Coal Mine!
Since the Datong Coal Mine launched a safe production campaign in the fourth quarter of last year, only a few small mines, such as Dongshazui, Majiliang, and Wujiayao, have achieved some results. However, other mines have not paid enough attention to the policy of safe production. As a result, accidents causing injuries and deaths have continued to occur since January of this year. By January 27th, a total of six people had died and sixty-three were injured, accounting for 40% of the total deaths for the entire previous year. The Tongjialiang Mine was the most serious case, with two workers killed, two seriously injured, and twelve slightly injured within twenty-seven days in January. The fundamental reasons for the continuous occurrence of casualties at Datong Coal Mine are: (1) Negligence and carelessness in leadership, insufficient inspection of safety discipline and implementation of safety regulations. For example, the Tongjialiang Mine hired Wang Lun, a fifteen-year-old child laborer, to watch the air door underground. This was done without review by the mine's personnel department or agreement from the labor union, and without any training above ground. The fact that the deputy chief of the safety department carelessly recruited him as an underground worker is a fundamental violation of safety regulations and labor policies. Although there were security personnel on duty underground every day at the mine, they did not discover this matter. On the day of the accident, Deputy Mine Manager Tian Zhibin, Security Team Leader Shi Yangqing, and Coal Mining Area Chief Zhang were all on duty underground, but they did not promptly check on the fifteen-year-old child laborer Wang Lun watching the air door, leading to the accident in which Wang Lun was crushed to death by a coal car. (2) A purely profit-driven viewpoint, neglecting the necessary facilities for safety engineering. For example, the explosives factory is the most dangerous workplace, but basic safety equipment such as protective panels and single-person work rooms were not provided. Workers had suggested this many times, but the leadership did not solve the problem in a timely manner, resulting in this mercury fulminate explosion accident. Deputy Mine Manager Tian Zhibin of the Tongjialiang Mine said when reviewing the causes of the accident: When laying underground tracks, the security specifications of the project were not taken into account in order to rush the work and produce coal quickly, so the tracks were laid haphazardly, leading to frequent derailments of coal cars, etc. (3) Failure to pay attention to safety education at ordinary times, failure to learn from the lessons of accidents, and gradually increased complacency among employees. For example, before the accident, safety education for workers at the Tongjialiang Mine was very poor. Workers were often told in general terms to pay attention to safety, but there were few planned and prepared explanations of safety production knowledge. The leadership of the explosives factory believed that the workers were all skilled workers and there was no need for education, so labor discipline was lax. Individual workers did not listen to the instructions of the security personnel. (4) Failure to pay attention to timely safety inspections and repairs. Some mines do not pay enough attention to underground safety, inspections, and mechanical repairs. For example, the coal cutting machine, electric drill, and electric chute, and other machinery at the Yongdingzhuang Mine were not repaired in a timely manner. The shift handover system at the Baidong Mine was not very strict. Therefore, transportation accidents and mechanical accidents frequently occurred underground. There were more than 30 such incidents in January alone.
In order to learn from the lessons of these accidents, the Party Committee of the mining area has urgently instructed all general branches and branches to place safe production work in a position of paramount importance, calling on Party members to pay attention to safety, and in coordination with the mining bureau and the labor union, to conduct inspections of the causes of the accidents.

### 大同煤矿事故层出！

　　大同煤矿事故层出！
    大同煤矿自去年第四季开展安全生产运动以来，除东沙咀、马脊梁、吴家窑等个别小窑获得一些成绩外，其他各矿对安全生产方针仍不够注意。因此，今年一月份以来伤亡事故不断发生，至一月二十七日共计死亡六名，伤六十三名。占去年全年死亡的百分之四十。其中以同家梁矿最为严重，该矿在一月份二十七天内就死亡工人二名，重伤二名，轻伤十二名。大同煤矿伤亡事故连续发生的基本原因是：（一）领导思想上的麻痹大意，对保安纪律的检查和保安规程的执行都不够。如同家梁矿雇用十五岁的童工王伦到井下看风门，既没有经过该矿人事股的审查和工会的同意，又没经过井上的训练，这样由保安股副股长私人马虎的录用为井下工人，根本就是违犯保安规程和劳动政策的。该矿每天都有值班保安员下井，但都没有发觉这件事。在发生事故的当天，副矿长田志斌、保安班长石养清和采煤区张区长等都在井下值班，也没有及时检查到十五岁的童工王伦在那里看风门，以致发生王伦被煤车挤死的事故。（二）单纯的营利观点，忽略了保安工程应有的设施。如火药厂是最危险的工作场所，起码的保安设备，如护身板和单人工作房等设备都没有，工人建议过多次，但领导上都没有及时解决，以致造成这次的雷汞爆炸事故。同家梁矿田志斌副矿长在检讨事故发生原因时说：在铺设井下道轨时，只是为了突击工作，很快出煤，因此就没有注意到工程的保安规格，将道轨铺的乱七八糟，以致经常发生煤车落道事故等。（三）平时不重视保安教育，不接受事故的教训，逐渐增长了职工的麻痹思想。如同家梁矿在事故发生前，对工人的保安教育很差，经常是笼统的向工人说要注意保安，但是很少有计划有准备的向工人讲解安全生产常识。火药厂的领导上认为都是熟练工人，无需进行教育，因此劳动纪律松懈。个别工人不听保安员的指挥。（四）不重视保安的及时检查和检修。有些矿对井下的保安、检查和机械的检修很不重视。如永定庄矿的截煤机、电钻和电溜等机械的检修很不及时。白洞矿的交接班制很不严格。因此，在井下的运搬事故和机械事故经常发生，仅一月份就有三十余件。
    为了接受以上这些事故的教训，矿区党委会已紧急指示各总支和分支应将安全生产工作放在头等重要的位置，号召党员重视保安，并协同矿局和工会，对事故的发生，进行检查。
