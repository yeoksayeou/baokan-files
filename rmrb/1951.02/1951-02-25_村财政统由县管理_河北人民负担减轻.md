Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 22nd: After a considerable period of efforts and improvements in financial work across Hebei Province, the financial revenues and expenditures of villages are now uniformly managed by the finance departments of county-level People's Governments. This measure has proven to be an effective way to reduce the burden on the people and rationally develop local undertakings.

After Hebei Province implemented the unified management of village finances at the county level, village financial income is collected uniformly by the county People's Government along with the public grain, according to the proportion stipulated by the Central People's Government. On the expenditure side, expenses such as village government funds, village education funds, subsidies for families of martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and families of revolutionary workers, temporary construction expenses, village cultural and recreational activities, and militia armaments are also allocated uniformly by the county People's Government. According to current statistics, more than 80% of the villages and counties in the province have implemented this method. During the process of unified management, the Hebei Provincial People's Government formulated methods and systems for the unified management of village finances. Village government expenditure is divided into five types and different expenditure standards according to the size of the village, and funds are issued regularly according to these standards. Other temporary construction, cultural and recreational activities, families of martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, family of revolutionary workers subsidies, and other expenses are budgeted in advance by the village governments, approved by the village people's representative meeting, and reported to the district for county approval. After the expenditure, the final accounts are reported quarterly, and after being reported to the district for verification, they are announced in the village. The county government designates each village to report and receive reimbursement on certain dates. In some counties, the district government holds a meeting of financial cadres at the end of each month to report the expenses of the previous month and review the expenses of the next month. This method has further put the management of village finances on the right track.

After the village finances are uniformly raised and disbursed by the county, the first advantage is that, within the scope of the county, there are conditions for concentrating economic strength, using it strategically, and promoting rural construction. For example, after the education funds of each village are uniformly disbursed, the difficulty of poor and small villages being unable to run schools has been solved because of the rational use of funds. For example, in Yi County, there are 163 villages with fewer than 100 households out of 499 villages. In the past, most of them were unable to run schools, and there were many out-of-school children. After the village education funds were centrally disbursed by the county, 162 primary schools and 10 higher primary schools were added, basically meeting the requirement of one school per village. As the number of schools increased, the number of students also increased greatly. According to statistics from the entire province, the number of students increased by more than 50% after the village education funds were centrally disbursed by the county. In addition, other important local undertakings within the county have also been developed. For example, in 1950, each county in the province established a county hospital, and 129 counties established farms.

Secondly, the unified management of village finances saves a lot of expenditure and reduces the burden on the people. Most counties in Shijiazhuang and Ding County special districts have saved a lot of funds after uniformly purchasing and distributing kerosene, paper, and pens for village governments and primary schools. According to statistics from An Guo County alone, the annual savings amounted to 72,000 jin of millet. At the same time, due to unified management, phenomena such as arbitrary apportionment, fundraising, corruption, and waste in some villages have been eliminated. According to an inspection in Yi County, all villages except three, which privately apportioned funds from the masses for performing old dramas (which were promptly corrected), conscientiously abided by the financial system.

　　村财政统由县管理
    河北人民负担减轻
    【新华社保定二十二日电】河北省各地财政工作，经过较长时期的努力改进之后，已将村的财政收支由各县人民政府财政部门统一管理。这一措施证明是减轻人民负担，合理兴办地方事业的有效方法。
    河北省以县为单位统一管理村财政以后，村财政收入即按中央人民政府规定的比例统一由县人民政府随公粮附征。支出方面，村政府经费、村教育费、烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属优待费、临时修建费、村文娱活动及民兵武装等开支，也统一由县人民政府拨发。据目前统计，全省百分之八十以上的村庄和县份已实行了这个办法。在统一管理过程中，河北省人民政府制订了统一管理村财政的办法和制度。村政府经费开支根据村庄大小，分为五种类型和不同开支标准，按此标准定期发给经费。其他临时修建、文娱活动、烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属优待等开支，由各村政府定期预先编造预算，经过村人民代表会议通过后，报区转县批准。开支后再按季报告决算，并一面报区核销，一面在村公布。村教育经费大部县份由区教育助理员按照本区教员人数作出预算，由区财政助理员于月初向县领取，月终报销。村政府经费及其他开支，由县政府指定各村在一定日期到县报销和领取。有的县份于每月终了，由区政府召开财政干部会议，报销上月开支和审核下月支出。这种办法，使村政财管理进一步走上了正轨。
    村财政由县统一筹支后，首先是在县的范围内已有条件可以集中经济力量，重点使用，推动农村建设。如各村教育费在统一开支后，由于得到合理使用，便解决了贫困小村无力办学的困难。如易县四百九十九个村，百户以下的就有一百六十三个，过去大部因无力办学，失学儿童很多。村教育费由县统筹支出后，便增加了小学一百六十二处，高小十处，基本上达到一村一校的要求。由于学校增加，学生人数也大大增加。据全省统计，学生人数在村教育费由县统筹支出后，增加了百分之五十以上。此外，县范围内其他重要的地方事业也有展开。如一九五○年内全省每县建立了一个县立医院，一百二十九个县建立了农场。
    其次是统一管理村财政后，节省了大量开支，减轻了人民负担。石家庄、定县两专区的多数县份，统一购发村政府与小学校所用的灯油、纸、笔等实物后，都节省很多经费。只安国一县统计，全年因此节省的小米就有七万二千斤。同时由于统一管理，消除了某些村中滥行摊派、募集及贪污浪费等现象。据易县检查，全县除三个村因唱旧剧私向群众摊派外（已及时纠正），其他的村庄都认真地遵守了财政制度。
