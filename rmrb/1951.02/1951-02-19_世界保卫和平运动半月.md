	Half-Month of the World Movement for the Defense of Peace
		I. The World Peace Council is about to convene
	The Second Enlarged Meeting of the World Peace Council will soon be held in Berlin. Our country's delegation, headed by Guo Moruo, has been dispatched to participate. This meeting will discuss the implementation of the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress and the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, among other issues. More than three months after the closing of the Second World Peace Congress, the world peace movement has made great progress. Our people's just struggle to resist American aggression and aid Korea has achieved great victories. However, American imperialism, which has suffered heavy defeats in the Korean War, is still persisting in its aggression against Korea and Taiwan and preparing to expand the war, especially by intensifying its sinister activities to rearm West Germany in Europe and rearm Japan in Asia. This sinful act of American imperialism has aroused universal anger and resolute opposition from peace-loving people all over the world.
	The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council held a meeting in Geneva on January 10 and 11, believing that the rearmament of Germany and Japan has caused deep anxiety throughout the world, especially among the people of these two countries. The Executive Bureau decided to advance the meeting of the World Peace Council to February 21-24. The Executive Bureau also announced the agenda of the Council meeting as: 1. Implementation of the resolutions of the Second World Congress for the Defense of Peace; 2. Peaceful resolution of the German and Japanese questions. These agendas are closely related to the struggle our people are waging against American aggression and against the arming of Japan. We believe that this meeting will bring a new high tide to the movement of peace-loving people around the world, including the Chinese people, against the rearmament of Germany and Japan.
		II. International Democratic Organizations call for strengthening the peace movement
	In the high tide of opposing German and Japanese armament and defending world peace, the International Democratic Women's Federation held a council meeting in Berlin from January 31 to February 7. All the representatives attending the meeting unanimously believed that the most important task at present is to attract millions of women to participate in the peace movement and more forcefully strike at the activities of the imperialist camp to instigate war. The resolution adopted by the meeting pointed out that the resolutions of the Second World Congress for the Defense of Peace are the most powerful weapons grasped by the people of all countries in their struggle to defend international peace and security. The resolution called on democratic women's organizations in various countries to actively support the peace program revealed by the Peace Congress and participate in the implementation of the resolutions made by the World Peace Council.
	The Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation, which unites 91 million organized women from various countries, issued an appeal to mothers, wives, and sisters around the world: women demand peace, oppose war, demand that the American aggressor troops withdraw from Korea, aid Korean women and children, and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of West Germany and Japan.
	The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth held a meeting in Prague on February 7. In his report, Billinguer, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, pointed out that the main tasks at present are: to widely publicize the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress, strengthen the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, further support the Korean people and the people of other Asian countries who are fighting against imperialist aggressors, and strengthen the struggle to win democratic and social rights for youth. The meeting on the 8th also adopted a resolution urging the World Federation of Democratic Youth and youth organizations in various countries to actively support the statement issued by the Secretariat of the World Peace Council calling for support for the proposal for universal disarmament.
		III. The movement for overall peace in Japan
	Simultaneous with the US conspiracy to arm Japan, the Japanese people’s movement against rearmament and demanding overall peace is developing.
	In mid-January, the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, left-wing Socialist Party organizations, and seventy workers’ and other democratic groups held a conference of representatives in Tokyo. They decided to launch a nationwide movement demanding the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, resolutely opposing the rearmament of Japan, and believing that “the immediate withdrawal of all occupation forces after the conclusion of the peace treaty is necessary for Japan’s independence and peaceful survival.” This conference of representatives of national patriotic democratic parties and groups also resolved to establish central and local “Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Councils” to promote this movement and collect signatures throughout the country. The results of the signatures will be reported to Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, the President of the United States, and the British Prime Minister. This joint meeting of various Japanese parties and groups marks the beginning of a new high tide in the Japanese people's movement for strong unity, opposing rearmament, and demanding comprehensive peace.
	The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a message on January 20, calling on all democratic parties, people's organizations, and peace organizations to widely launch this national movement demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty. The message expressed its support for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation, supported the Soviet Union's memorandum to the United States regarding the Japanese peace treaty, and supported the statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on December 4 last year.
	Recently, the Japanese "Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council" has been formally established in Kobe City and is developing throughout the country. The voting campaign for a comprehensive peace treaty is also actively underway. Workers at "Kawasaki Steel Company" in Hyogo Prefecture have begun collecting votes for a comprehensive peace treaty. This patriotic organization of the Japanese people wrote an open letter to US representative Dulles when he arrived in Japan to conduct unilateral peace activities, telling him: "The Japanese working people clearly oppose separate peace and rearmament." During Dulles' visit to Japan, a conference of Japanese scientists held in Tokyo in early February also issued a statement opposing separate peace and rearmament. In addition, Dulles recently admitted that during his stay in Japan, he received "thousands upon thousands of letters from the Japanese people, almost all of which thoroughly opposed any rearmament." This is a heavy blow to the American imperialist conspiracy to unilaterally make peace with Japan and rearm Japanese militarist forces.
		IV. Opposition to American Armament of West Germany
	The people of Western European countries resolutely oppose the American conspiracy to arm West Germany. The reactionary ruling groups in the Marshall Plan countries, who act as accomplices of American imperialism in arming West Germany by following the lead of the American emperor, have also been condemned and opposed by the people of various countries. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on January 20, calling on the French people to shatter the plan to arm West Germany and expressing support for the conclusion of a treaty with a unified and democratic Germany. The signature campaign held by the French people to oppose the armament of West Germany has made great progress. Workers in many factories and enterprises have participated in the signature campaign. More than 145,000 people have signed in the Rhône estuary province, and 99 percent of the residents of Saint-Auban have participated in the signature campaign. Thousands of citizens in various places have also held rallies to protest the armament of West Germany. Dockworkers and railway workers in Bordeaux have refused to transport American military supplies for the European aggressors, taking practical action to oppose the sinister plan to arm West Germany. The people of Italy, Britain, Belgium, and even Israel on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, with great anger, shouted "Eisenhower, go back to America! We want peace!", causing Eisenhower, the war peddler sent to Europe to organize the European aggressor forces, to run into walls everywhere.
	The people of West Germany unanimously oppose the American attempt to drag them into a terrible war. In the American, British, and French occupied zones, workers and citizens are gathering everywhere and putting forward demands for unified action and united struggle. At a workers' rally in Bochum (British occupied zone), a resolution was passed calling on all working people to unite and act together to restore Germany's unity, guarantee peace, stop re-militarization, and guide the German people toward a better future. The employees of the large military factory Hörster Company in the Ruhr area stated in their letter to Adenauer: "We firmly refuse to obey the orders of foreigners and die on the battlefield for the interests of foreigners."
		V. People all over the world condemn the American proposal to slander our country
	The American imperialism's act of manipulating and hijacking the United Nations General Assembly on February 1 to pass a proposal that distorts right and wrong to so-called "condemn Communist China as an aggressor in Korea" has not only been unanimously opposed by our people, but also condemned by peace-loving people all over the world.
	The Korean people, who are fighting heroically against the brutal American aggressors, expressed great anger at the American proposal to slander our country. Park Jung-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's General Alliance, pointed out: "30 million Korean people unanimously condemn the American imperialists as the most vicious enemies of peace. The aggressors are them, not China."
	Vietnam's "Voice of Vietnam" radio station published a commentary, denouncing the United Nations for illegally passing a proposal under American pressure to slander our country. It stated: "The sympathy and support of the people of the world are on the side of the Chinese People's Government, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the heroic Korean people."
	People and public opinion circles in India, Indonesia, and Pakistan unanimously condemned the American government's proposal aimed at expanding aggression against Asia. More than 110 faculty members from Delhi University and its affiliated colleges in India issued a statement on February 3, believing that China's willingness to participate in peace talks is clear evidence that China intends to stop the expansion of the Korean War and promote world peace.
	People in European countries also unanimously condemned the American proposal to slander our country. The Czech newspaper *People's Daily* pointed out: "Only the just peace proposal of the People's Republic of China can bring justice and a peaceful resolution to the Asian issue and strengthen world peace." An editorial in the British *Daily Worker* pointed out: "The American proposal is not only opposed by the Soviet Union, but also by India and Burma. This proposal has not received the support of any Asian country. It is opposed by the majority of mankind." The Central Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement, denouncing the United States for manipulating the United Nations to slander our country, and called on the broad masses of French working people to unite and struggle, and denounce the American imperialists as aggressors against Korea.

　　世界保卫和平运动半月
            一、世界和平理事会即将召开
    二届和大理事会会议即将在柏林举行，我国和大已派遣郭沫若为首的代表团前往参加。这次会议将讨论二次世界和平大会决议的执行情况和西德及日本的重新武装等问题。二次和大闭幕后三个多月以来，世界和平运动已有很大发展，我国人民反抗美国侵略援助朝鲜的正义斗争，已获得很大胜利。但是在侵朝战争中遭受了惨重失败的美国帝国主义，还在坚持侵略朝鲜台湾并准备扩大战争，特别是正在加紧进行在欧洲重新武装西德、在亚洲重新武装日本的阴谋活动。美国帝国主义这种罪恶行径，已激起世界爱好和平人民的普遍的愤怒和坚决的反对。
    世界和平理事会执行局于一月十、十一两日在日内瓦举行会议，认为德国与日本两国的重新武装已在全世界特别是该两国人民中间引起深切的焦虑。执行局决定提前于二月二十一日至二十四日召开世界和平理事会会议。执行局并宣布理事会会议议程为：一、第二届世界保卫和平大会决议执行情况；二、以和平方式解决德国和日本问题。这些议程对我国人民正在展开的抗美援朝反对武装日本的斗争有很大的关系。我们相信，这次会议必将为世界爱好和平人民包括中国人民的反对德、日重新武装运动带来一个新高潮。
            二、国际民主组织号召加强和平运动
    在反对德、日武装、保卫世界和平运动的高潮中，国际民主妇联于一月三十一日至二月七日在柏林举行理事会会议，全体与会代表一致认为，当前最主要的任务为吸引千百万妇女参加到保卫和平运动中来，更加有力地打击帝国主义阵营挑拨战争的活动。会议通过的决议中指出：第二届世界保卫和平大会的各项决议是世界各族人民在为保卫国际和平与安全而斗争中所掌握的最强有力的武器。决议号召各国的民主妇女团体积极拥护和平大会所揭示的和平纲领，参加贯彻世界和平理事会所作的各项决议。
    团结着九千一百万各国有组织的妇女的国际民主妇联理事会向全世界的母亲们、妻子们、姊妹们发出呼吁：妇女们要求和平，反对战争，要求美国侵略军撤出朝鲜，援助朝鲜妇女与儿童，反对美帝国主义重新武装西德和日本。
    世界民主青联执行委员会于二月七日在布拉格举行会议，世界民主青联主席比林格尔在他所作的报告中指出，当前的主要任务是：广泛地宣传第二届世界和大的决议，加强反对西德和日本重新武装的斗争，更大规模地声援为反抗帝国主义侵略者而斗争的朝鲜人民和亚洲其他各国的人民，加强争取青年的民主与社会权利的斗争。八日会议并通过决议，敦促世界民主青联及各国青年组织积极支持世界和平理事会秘书处发表的号召支持普遍裁军建议的声明。
            三、日本国内的全面媾和运动
    与美国阴谋武装日本的同时，日本人民反对重新武装、要求全面媾和的运动正在发展。
    一月中，日本共产党、劳农党、左翼社会党组织以及七十个工人与其他民主团体曾在东京举行代表会议，决定发动全国规模的要求签订全面对日和约运动，坚决反对日本重新武装，并认为“在订立和约以后立即撤退一切占领军，对于日本的独立与和平生存是必要的”。这一全国性爱国民主党派团体的代表会议并决议设立中央及地方的“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”，以便推动这个运动并在全国普遍征集签名，签名结果将报告斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席，美国总统及英国首相。日本各党派各团体的这次联合会议，标志着日本人民坚强团结、反对重新武装、要求全面缔和的运动一个新高潮的开始。
    日本共产党临时中央指导部已于一月二十日发表文告，号召各民主党派、人民团体、和平组织，广泛展开这个要求缔结全面和约的全民性运动。文告表示主张按照波茨坦公告缔结全面和约，拥护苏联对美国关于对日和约的备忘录并拥护我外交部周恩来部长于去年十二月四日所发表的声明。
    最近日本“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”已在神户市正式建立，并正向全国各地发展；为征集全面和约的投票运动也在积极进行，兵库县“川崎制铁公司”的工人开始征集全面和约投票。日本人民的这一爱国组织于美国代表杜勒斯抵日进行片面媾和活动时，曾写公开信给他，告诉他：“日本劳动人民群众很明显地反对单独媾和与重新武装”。在杜勒斯访日期间，在东京举行的日本科学家会议也于二月初发表声明，反对单独媾和与重新武装。此外，杜勒斯最近承认，他在日期间曾收到日本人民方面写给他的“成千成千封信件，几乎全都彻底反对任何重新武装”。这对美国帝国主义片面对日媾和和重新武装日本军国主义势力的阴谋，是一个沉重的打击。
            四、反对美国武装西德
    西欧各国人民坚决地反对美国武装西德的阴谋。马歇尔化国家里的反动统治集团仰承美帝鼻息充当美帝武装西德的同谋犯，同样地遭到了各国人民的谴责与反对。法共政治局于一月二十日发表声明，号召法国人民粉碎武装西德的计划，并表示支持与统一的民主德国缔结和约。法国人民为反对武装西德而举行的签名运动已有很大的发展，许多工厂企业的工人都参加了签名，罗尼河口省有十四万五千多人签名，圣奥本一地有居民百分之九十九参加签名。各地成千的市民并举行抗议武装西德的集会。波尔多的码头工人与铁路工人且拒绝给欧洲侵略军运输美国军火，以实际行动反对武装西德的阴谋计划。意大利、英国、比利时、甚至地中海东岸的以色列的人民，都以极大的愤怒，高呼“艾森豪威尔，滚回美国去！我们要和平！”，使美国派往欧洲活动组织欧洲侵略军的战争贩子艾森豪威尔到处碰壁。
    西德各地人民一致反对美国将他们拖入可怕的战争中去的企图。在美、英、法占领区，工人们、市民们到处集会，并提出统一行动团结斗争的要求。波却姆（英占区）工人集会时，通过决议，号召全体劳动人民团结一致地行动起来，恢复德国的统一，保证和平、制止重新军国主义化、引导德国人民走向美好的未来。鲁尔区大军火厂贺尔斯特公司的职工们在其致阿登纳的信中表示：“我们坚决拒绝听从外国人的命令、为外国的利益而去战死沙场。”
            五、全世界人民斥责美国诽谤我国的提案
    美国帝国主义于二月一日操纵和劫持联合国大会通过颠倒是非的所谓“谴责共产党中国为在朝鲜的侵略者”提案的行为不但受到我国人民一致反对，而且也受到全世界爱好和平人民的谴责。
    正在为反对凶残的美国侵略者而英勇战斗着的朝鲜人民，对美国诽谤我国的提案表示极大愤怒。朝鲜民主妇女总同盟委员长朴正爱指出：“三千万朝鲜人民一致谴责美帝国主义者是和平的最凶恶的敌人。侵略者正是他们而不是中国。”
    越南的“越南之声”电台发表评论，痛斥联合国在美国压力下非法通过诬蔑我国的提案。并称：“全世界人民的同情和支持是在中国人民政府、中国人民志愿军和英勇的朝鲜人民一边的。”
    印度、印尼、巴基斯坦的人民和舆论界，一致谴责美国政府旨在扩大对亚洲侵略的提案。印度德里大学及其所属各学院的一百一十余位教员，于二月三日发表声明，认为中国表示愿意参加和平谈判就是中国意欲制止朝鲜战争的扩大并促进世界和平的明证。
    欧洲各国人民也一致斥责美国诽谤我国的提案。捷克《人民报》指出：“唯有中华人民共和国的公正的和平建议，能够带来正义和亚洲问题的和平解决，并加强全世界的和平。”英国《工人日报》的社论指出：“美国的提案不但受到苏联的反对，而且受到印度和缅甸的反对。这个提案没有得到任何一个亚洲国家的支持。它受到大多数人类的反对。”法国共产党中央政治局发表声明，斥责美国在操纵联合国诽谤我国的提案，并号召法国劳动人民大众团结起来进行斗争，斥责美帝国主义者为对朝鲜的侵略者。
