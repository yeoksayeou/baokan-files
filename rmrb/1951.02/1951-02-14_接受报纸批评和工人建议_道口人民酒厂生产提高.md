　　Accepting Newspaper Criticism and Workers' Suggestions
　  Daokou People's Distillery Improves Production
    In the past, administrative leaders of the public Daokou People's Distillery in Pingyuan Province failed to rely on workers to improve production effectively. To complete production tasks, they excessively extended workers' working hours, reaching fourteen hours per day. As a result, workers were exhausted and suffered from constant illnesses, leading to worker complaints like, "I'd rather beg than work at the distillery." Last November, after the Pingyuan Daily provided strict criticism of this situation, the Daokou Town General Labor Union first examined its own bureaucratic work style and conducted public self-criticism in the Pingyuan Daily. This influenced the distillery, and the factory administration also followed suit, examining its own bureaucratic work style, task-oriented perspective, and erroneous thinking of not caring for and relying on workers. They also readily adopted workers' reasonable suggestions, adding three workers per pot and changing the work schedule from one shift to two shifts, day and night, appropriately adjusting working hours. Subsequently, workers actively researched and improved techniques, reducing the amount of chaff used per jin of alcohol from two jin to fifteen liang; increasing the pot capacity from 200 jin to 250 jin; saving two liang of grain per jin of alcohol; and saving more than 200 jin of coal per day. This lowered costs and increased output. In the past, with a single shift, the daily alcohol production was 1,300 jin; now it has increased to 1,800 jin. Workers' production enthusiasm has increased, and their thinking has stabilized. Technician Zhao of the factory said, "If working hours hadn't been reduced, I wouldn't have wanted to come back after the New Year. With this change, I'm planning on staying at the factory for the long term!"

　　接受报纸批评和工人建议
　  道口人民酒厂生产提高
    平原省公营道口人民酒厂，行政领导干部过去未能很好依靠工人提高生产，为了完成生产任务，过度延长工人的劳动时间，每日达十四小时，工人因此疲劳不堪，疾病不断发生，以致工人反应：“要饭也不能干酒厂的活。”去年十一月间，经平原日报对此进行了严格的批评后，道口镇总工会首先检查了工会的官僚主义作风；并在平原报上公开自我批评。这样便影响了酒厂，该厂行政也跟着检查了自己的官僚主义作风、任务观点及不关心工人不依靠工人的错误思想；并很好地采纳了工人的合理建议，每口锅增加三个工人，工作由一班改为昼夜两班，适当地调整了工作时间。此后，工人积极钻研改进技术，每斤酒由用二斤糠秕减到用十五两；使锅的容量由二百斤增至二百五十斤；每斤酒节省粮食二两；每天省煤二百多斤。降低了成本，又提高了产量。过去一班制时，每天产酒一千三百斤，现在提高到一千八百斤。工人的生产情绪提高，思想稳定，该厂赵技师说：“如不减少工时，年关回家就不想再来，这样一改，在工厂中就要作长期打算哩！”
