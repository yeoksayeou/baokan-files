　　Ma Hengchang Writes to Workers Nationwide Calling for Production Emulation
    Presents Three Hopes for the National Production Emulation Movement
    [This Dispatch] Beijing Workers' Daily published a letter from Ma Hengchang to the workers across the nation responding to the Ma Hengchang Team's challenge on the 9th of this month. Ma Hengchang is currently recuperating at the Anshan Qilingzi Workers' Sanatorium. In his letter, he presents three hopes for the current emulation movement. The original letter is as follows: Dear worker brothers and sisters,
    Lying in my hospital room, I heard the enthusiastic news of your responses from the radio. I am especially happy, and I feel my illness has improved a bit. Your factories and mines are in the capital, Tianjin, Tangshan, Jinan, and various parts of Northeast China, and even in the South, thousands of miles away. No matter how far apart we are, I salute you all!
    This nationwide production emulation campaign is a patriotic competition. That is to say: our entire nation is engaged in the work of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country. Many have already joined the Volunteer Army and gone to Korea, and young workers and students have entered military academies. We workers who produce in factories can only support them by organizing production emulation. We must use such practical actions to realize Chairman Mao's instruction: to establish a strong national defense force and a strong economic force. Only in this way can peace be guaranteed, and the fruits of victory will not be seized by the imperialists.
    Comrades! I am a 47-year-old veteran lathe operator who grew up in the Northeast. I have tasted the bitterness of being a slave under the puppet Manchurian regime and suffered under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, when I heard that the United States was arming Japan again, I was very angry, and I resolved to make the Ma Hengchang Team even better to answer the American aggressors.
    Comrades! This competition of ours has already become a national movement. This is unprecedented in our history. Now that we have started it, we must make sure it is done right. I am a straightforward person, and I have to say what is on my mind. I hope:
    1. That what is said is done. Our Ma Hengchang Team must first set an example and publish our results in the newspaper at a certain time.
    2. Do not only respond to our team's challenge. You must also challenge every team in your factory and help and promote all the teams in your factory as much as possible to participate in the patriotic labor emulation. This will have an even greater effect.
    3. Do not have a "hot and cold" disease. We must continue the competition persistently and regularly.
        Finally, I wish everyone
    Victory in the competition!
                                                  Ma Hengchang
                                          January 29
                              Mailing Address: Anshan Qilingzi Workers' Sanatorium

　　马恒昌写信给全国应战工友
    对全国生产竞赛运动提出三点希望
    【本报讯】北京工人日报于本月九日发表了马恒昌给全国响应马恒昌小组挑战的工人们的一封信。马恒昌现正在鞍山七岭子工人疗养院休养。他在信中对目前的竞赛运动提出三点希望。原信如下：亲爱的职工兄弟姊妹们：
    我躺在病房里，从电匣子中听到您们热烈的应战消息。我特别高兴，我的病也觉得好了一些。您们的厂矿，有在首都的、天津的、唐山的、济南和东北各地的，甚至还有在数千里以外的南方。不管我们相距多少远，我都向您们致敬！
    这一次全国生产大竞赛，是爱国主义的竞赛。就是说：我们全国人民都在做着抗美援朝保家卫国的工作。许多人已经参加志愿军到朝鲜去了，青年工人、学生们走进了军校。我们在工厂里生产的工人，就只有用组织生产竞赛来支援他们。用这样的实际行动来实现毛主席的指示：建立强大的国防力量和强大的经济力量。这样，和平才有保障，胜利果实才不会被帝国主义夺去。
    工友同志们！我是一个生长在东北的四十七岁的老车工。我尝过伪满洲国时代亡国奴的苦味，受尽了蒋介石的压迫。所以，我一听到美国又要武装日本，便非常愤怒，我决心要把马恒昌小组搞得更好，来回答美国侵略者。
    工友同志们！我们这次竞赛，已经成为一个全国性的运动了。这是我们历史中从来没有过的。我们已经搞起来了，就一定要把它搞得像个样子。我是个心直口快的人，有话就要说出来，我希望：
    一、要说到就要做到。我们马恒昌小组，首先就要做个榜样，到一定的时候，在报纸上公布成绩。
    二、不要光是向我们小组应战。您们还要向全厂每一个小组挑战，尽可能地帮助与推动您们全厂的小组，都来参加爱国主义的劳动竞赛。这样起的作用就会更大些。
    三、不要犯冷热病。要持久地经常地竞赛下去。
        最后，祝大家
    竞赛胜利！
                                                  马恒昌
                                          一月二十九日
                              通讯处：鞍山七岭子工人疗养院
