　　US-Japan Reactionaries Form Collusion
　  Yoshida Reactionary Government Accepts US Imperialist Plan to Rearm Japan
    Japanese People Launch Movement to Win Overall Peace Treaty
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 11th] Tokyo dispatch: Warmonger Dulles is about to end his conspiratorial activities in Japan. Under the coercion and enticement of the American reactionaries, the Japanese Yoshida reactionary government has betrayed the interests of the Japanese people, formed a tacit understanding with its American masters, and accepted the plan to rearm Japan and serve America's aggressive policy.
    After visiting MacArthur on the 6th, Yoshida held a third meeting with Dulles on the 7th. According to the Kuomintang bandit Central News Agency, a "reliable source close to Japan" said: "Shigeru Yoshida has assured Dulles and MacArthur that as soon as the peace treaty is concluded, he will urge Japan to prepare to reorganize its military under the joint responsibility of Japan and the United States." According to Kyodo News Agency: This meeting "was held to reach a final conclusion on the basic issues of the peace talks that have been continuing since January 29." The central content of the meeting was: "1. Confirm the US government's seven principles for the peace treaty with Japan. 2. The form of security guarantee for Japan's independence after the peace treaty, which will serve as a guarantee for the peace treaty with Japan. 3. The scale and method of Japan's rearmament, which should run parallel with security guarantees, as well as the domestic procedures in Japan that are compatible with the Peace Constitution (referring to the post-war new constitution that stipulates Japan's abandonment of war). 4. The US government's economic guarantees when Japan chooses the path of rearmament." Kyodo News Agency revealed that the US and Japanese reactionaries have reached a "complete understanding" on the above issues.
    The Kuomintang bandit Central News Agency also revealed that this meeting between Dulles and Yoshida also discussed "the issue of Japan providing conveniences to the US military" after a separate peace treaty. The various points involved in this issue will form the outline of the "US-Japan military alliance" to be signed immediately after the separate peace treaty. According to a "reliable source close to Japan," this military alliance will include: "1. Establishing military facilities. Japan will provide barracks and training grounds to the US military in Japan for stationing and training. 2. The US military can pass through Japan in both wartime and peacetime. At the same time, Japan recognizes that US aircraft can fly over Japanese airspace at any time. 3. Japan will designate several docks for US warships and ocean vessels to dock. 4. Japan will be responsible for handling US military mail and telegrams within Japan. 5. Japan will establish special factories to repair weapons and ships for the US military. 6. Japan will provide warehouses to the US military for storing ordnance and supplies. 7. Japan will provide labor to the US military based on free contracts." This shows that the despicable collusion between the US and Japanese reactionaries is not only to drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for the United States, but also to attempt to have the US military occupy Japan for a long time, use Japan as a US military base, and steal Japanese manpower and material resources to serve America's aggressive adventures.
    In the conspiracy between the US and Japanese reactionaries, the Yoshida traitorous clique also put forward some of its own demands in terms of political, territorial, and economic interests, as conditions for selling out Japan to serve as an American tool of aggression. Some conditions have been tacitly approved by the United States. According to United Press and other sources, "The United States will in some way bear part of the cost of Japan's reconstruction of its military"; "The peace treaty will allow the Japanese to not have to fulfill the changes implemented in Japan during the occupation period, and those who have been purged will undoubtedly be able to resume public office at will"; "The restrictions recorded in the treaty are only matters of industrial level and other two or three limitations," and so on.
    However, the US and Japanese reactionaries have not been able to resolve the specific difficulties that will be encountered in rearming Japan. First of all, the awakened Japanese people are unwilling to serve as American cannon fodder. The Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party Reconstruction Faction (the party's left-wing organization), and about seventy trade unions and other democratic organizations across Japan have jointly resolved to launch a large-scale movement against rearmament and demanding an overall peace treaty. The Japanese Peace Protection Committee has also issued instructions to local peace movement organizations and democratic mass organizations, saying: "The struggle against rearming Japan and striving for the conclusion of an overall peace treaty is the specific task of Japan's peace movement." The rapid growth of Japan's democratic forces over the past five or six years has become a major obstacle to the US and Japanese reactionaries' implementation of their war plans. In view of such widespread mass demands, the Japanese Socialist Party, controlled by right-wing social democrats, has also repeatedly expressed its opposition to rearming Japan and demanded an overall peace treaty. Even former Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, the president of the Democratic Party, who shamelessly and repeatedly publicly advocated Japan's rearmament, had to admit: "The motion to rearm Japan may fail in a referendum in Japan to amend the constitution." Asahi Shimbun, the largest newspaper in Japan, which usually reflects the opinions of the middle class within the Japanese bourgeoisie, has also repeatedly expressed its opposition to a separate peace treaty and rearmament, believing that this will "bring many difficulties to Japan, which may lead to a serious crisis and may once again subject a Japan whose wounds have not yet healed to misfortune."
    In fact, Japan's national strength is very different from what it was before the surrender. Due to the loss of enslavement and exploitation of China (especially Northeast China) and Korea, Japan's economic strength has been greatly weakened. It cannot afford a huge rearmament plan. Yoshida himself admitted in his policy speech to the Diet on January 26: "In fact, any full rearmament is economically impossible for Japan." He added the next day: "Even if the United States bears the cost of rearming Japan, it cannot bear this huge cost."
    The US imperialist conspiracy to pursue a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan is being opposed and will continue to be opposed by the people of China, the people of the Soviet Union, the people of various people's democracies, the people of Asian countries, and all peace-loving people in the world. The powerful world peace and democracy forces will ultimately bury the US imperialist war plan.

### 美日反动派成立默契  吉田反动政府接受美帝重新武装日本计划  日本人民展开争取全面和约运动

　　美日反动派成立默契
　  吉田反动政府接受美帝重新武装日本计划 
    日本人民展开争取全面和约运动
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：战争贩子杜勒斯即将结束他在日本的阴谋活动。在美国反动派的胁迫和利诱之下，日本吉田反动政府已出卖日本人民的利益，与其美国主子成立默契，接受了重新武装日本并为美国的侵略政策服务的计划。
    吉田于六日访问麦克阿瑟之后，在七日与杜勒斯举行了第三次会谈。据国民党匪帮中央社透露，据“接近日本的可靠人士”说：“吉田茂已向杜勒斯及麦克阿瑟确切保证：一俟和约缔结，即将促使日本准备在日美联合责任下重整军备。”据共同社透露：这次会谈“是为了自一月二十九日以来所继续着的对媾和的基本问题作出最后结论而举行的”。会谈的中心内容是：“一、确认美国政府对对日媾和的七项原则。二、成为对日媾和保证的日本独立后的安全保障形式。三、应与安全保障并行的日本重整军备的规模与进行方法，以及配合和平宪法（按指规定日本放弃战争的战后新宪法）的日本国内手续问题。四、美国政府对日本选择重整军备道路时的经济上的保证。”共同社透露，关于上述问题，美、日反动派之间已获得“完全的谅解”。
    国民党匪帮中央社又透露，杜勒斯与吉田的这一次会谈，也曾讨论单独媾和后“日本给予美军便利的问题”。两人对这一问题所涉及的各点，将形成紧随在单独和约之后签订的“美日军事同盟”的纲要。据“接近日本的可靠人士”说，这一军事同盟将包括：“一、建立军事设备。日本将营房、操场供给在日美军作为驻扎及训练之用。二、美军无论在战时或平时皆可通过日本。同时，日本承认美国飞机无论在任何时候皆可在日本领空飞行。三、日本将指定若干码头供美国军舰及海洋船只停泊。四、日本将负责处理日本境内美国的军事邮件及电报。五、日本成立特别工厂，专门为美军修理武器及船只。六、日本将以仓库供给美军作为储存军械、给养之用。七、日本将根据自由合同以劳役供给美军。”这就显示美、日反动派所进行的卑鄙勾当，不仅是要驱使日本人民充当美国的炮灰，并且图谋由美军长期占领日本，将日本作为美国的军事基地，并盗用日本的人力和物力为美国的侵略冒险服务。
    在美、日反动派的密谋中，吉田卖国集团也曾提出自己在政治、领土、经济利益上的一些要求，作为出卖日本充当美国侵略工具的条件，有些条件已经为美国方面所默认。据合众社等透露，“美国将以某种方式负担日本重建军备的一部分费用”；“和约将使日本人不须履行占领时期在日本所实行的变革，受整肃者无疑地将可以随意重任公职”；“条约上记载的限制，只是工业水平及其他二三局限的事项”等。
    但是，美日反动派对于重新武装日本所将遭遇到的具体困难，并未能获得解决。首先是觉醒了的日本人民不愿意充当美国炮灰。日本共产党、劳农党、社会党再建派（该党左翼组织）以及全日各地的约七十个工会与其他民主组织，已经联合决议展开大规模的反对重新武装、要求全面和约的运动。日本拥护和平委员会也已向各地和平运动组织和民主群众团体发出指示说：“反对重新武装日本、争取缔结全面和约的斗争，是日本的和平运动的具体任务”。日本人民民主力量五六年来的迅速增长，已成为美日反动派推行战争计划的极大障碍。鉴于如此普遍的群众的主张，为右翼社会民主主义者所把持的日本社会党，也一再表示反对重新武装日本，要求全面媾和。甚至无耻地多次公开鼓吹日本再武装的前首相、民主党总裁芦田均，也不得不承认：“重新武装日本的动议，可能在日本进行修改宪法的公民投票中会要失败”。通常反映日本资产阶级内中等阶层意见的日本最大一家报纸朝日新闻也一再表示反对单独媾和及重新武装，认为这将“带给日本很多困难，这些困难可能促成严重的危机并可能再使一个创伤未愈的日本再遭恶运”。
    事实上日本国力已大非投降前可比。由于失去对中国（特别是东北）和朝鲜等地的奴役和榨取，日本的经济力量已大大削弱。它已负担不起庞大的重新武装计划。吉田本人于一月二十六日在国会中发表的施政演说曾承认：“事实上，任何充分的重新武装对日本说来，都是经济上所不可能的”。他在第二天又补充说：“即使美国担负重新武装日本的费用，这项巨额的费用也是它担负不了的”。
    美帝国主义对日单独媾和及重新武装日本的阴谋，正遭到并将继续遭到中国人民、苏联人民及各人民民主国家人民、亚洲各国人民以至全世界一切爱好和平人士的反对。强大的世界和平民主力量定将最后葬送美帝国主义的战争计划。
