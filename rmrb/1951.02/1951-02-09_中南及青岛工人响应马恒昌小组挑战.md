Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd: The movement to learn from and respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Team has initially unfolded among workers in the provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei, Guangzhou, Changsha, and Nanchang in the Central South region. Several advanced production teams have formulated conditions for accepting the challenge, and some have even used these conditions to challenge the entire city or province. In responding to the challenge, workers in various regions generally take into account the specific circumstances in the Central South region, such as low product quality, high defect rates, and frequent accidents, and propose their own conditions. In their responses, workers also universally emphasized the importance of uniting with technical personnel and fostering good master-apprentice relationships.

To launch the challenge campaign, the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions and the Federations of Trade Unions in Henan, Hunan, Guangzhou, Guilin, Changsha, Nanchang, and other provinces and cities have issued calls, urging all employees to enthusiastically respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Team and requiring trade unions at all levels to provide in-depth leadership.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 2nd: Workers in state-owned factories in Qingdao are actively responding to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Team. Liu Yixiu and Ma Kuanwen's teams from the passenger and freight car yard of the Sifang Railway Machinery Factory were the first to formulate specific conditions for accepting the challenge. Subsequently, teams such as the cold forging and riveting workshop of the State-owned Textile Machinery Factory, the iron workshop of the Cotton Textile Factory No. 8, the motor section of the Cotton Textile Factory No. 5, the electrical department of the motor section of the Cotton Textile Factory No. 7, and Liang Zuoqing's team from the Sanitation Team of the Construction Bureau, also discussed and studied the challenge conditions of the Ma Hengchang Team and formulated their own conditions based on their specific circumstances. In their response, Liu Tonggao's team from the State-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory also expressed their hope that the Ma Hengchang Team would promptly share any new experiences they create in the future for them to learn from. The challenge campaign is still ongoing among workers in various factories throughout the city.

　　中南及青岛工人
    响应马恒昌小组挑战
    【新华社汉口三日电】向马恒昌小组学习和应战的运动，已在中南地区的河南、湖北、广州、长沙、南昌等省市工人中初步展开。若干先进生产小组已订出应战条件，有的并以此应战条件向全市、全省提出挑战。各地工人在应战中，一般地都能根据中南地区存在的产品质量低、废品多及事故多的具体情况，提出自己的应战条件。在应战条件中，工人们还普遍重视了团结技术人员、搞好师徒关系的问题。
    为了发动应战，中南总工会筹委会及河南、湖南、广州、桂林、长沙、南昌等省市总工会已发出号召，号召全体职工热烈响应马恒昌小组的挑战，并要求各级工会深入领导。
    【新华社青岛二日电】青岛市国营工厂工人纷纷向马恒昌小组应战。四方铁路机厂客货车场刘义修、马宽文两个小组首先订出应战的具体条件。其后，国营纺织机械厂冷锻铆车间、棉纺八厂铁工部、棉纺五厂机动课、棉纺七厂机动课电气部及建设局清洁队梁作庆等小组，也都讨论学习了马恒昌小组的挑战条件，根据自己的具体情况订出了应战条件。国营青岛纺织机械厂刘同诰小组在应战书中还希望马恒昌小组今后把创造出来的新经验能随时告诉他们，以便学习。现全市各厂工人的应战仍在继续进行中。
