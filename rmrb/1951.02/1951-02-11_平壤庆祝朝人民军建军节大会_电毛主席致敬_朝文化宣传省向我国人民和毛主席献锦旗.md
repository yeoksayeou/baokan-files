Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th—The Pyongyang City All-Circles Rally celebrating the third anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army sent a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao Zedong:

　　We, who participated in the Pyongyang City Rally celebrating the third anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, would like to extend our highest honor and gratitude to you—the great leader of the Chinese people, to the heroic Chinese people under your leadership, and to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　At a difficult and arduous time for our Korean People's Army and the entire Korean people's struggle due to the frantic offensive of the imperialist invading forces headed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the great and brave Chinese brothers under your leadership raised the sword of justice to aid us in eliminating the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in close coordination with our People's Army, has stopped the enemy's frantic offensive and turned to the counter-offensive, pursuing and annihilating the enemy, displaying glorious and great combat achievements.

　　Today, the Korean People's Army, with the assistance of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, celebrates its third anniversary during the solemn offensive period to win the final victory in the Fatherland Liberation War.

　　The brotherly unity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, forged in blood on the battlefield of eliminating the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their running dogs—will inevitably lead our just struggle to final victory. This is a great contribution to world peace and security, especially to the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Asian people.

　　The entire Korean people are determined to further strengthen the eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, forged in blood in the common struggle against the imperialist aggressors. For the more brilliant victory of our Korean and Chinese peoples in the struggle against the common enemy—the U.S. imperialist armed aggressors—and for the happiness of the great Chinese people, we wish you eternal health.

　　Long live the brotherly unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th—The Ministry of Culture and Propaganda of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea presented a banner to the Chinese people and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, on the third anniversary of the "February 8th" founding of the People's Army.
