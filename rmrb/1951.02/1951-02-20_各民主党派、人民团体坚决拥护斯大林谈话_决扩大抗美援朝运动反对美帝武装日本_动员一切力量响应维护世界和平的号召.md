[Report from this newspaper] Various democratic parties and people's organizations, including the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Jiusan Society, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, have issued written opinions or statements supporting Generalissimo Stalin's statement on the international situation.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, stated in a talk: "Generalissimo Stalin's talk to a Pravda reporter on the current international situation is a heartening and delightful gospel amid the tense international situation created by the imperialist warmongers. He mercilessly exposed the plans and conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors headed by U.S. imperialism to expand the war, and pointed out the correct path for all peace-loving people around the world to save and consolidate peace. He made it clear to the people of the world, including those in capitalist countries, who wants war and who wants peace; who is the aggressor and who is resisting the aggressor." The talk stated: "The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang attaches great importance to this important talk by Generalissimo Stalin and will call on all party members and the people of the whole country to strengthen our combat strength and firm our combat will under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and to fight to the end against the imperialist warmongers to defend our motherland. We will sincerely cooperate with the people of the Soviet Union, the people of Korea, and the people of all people's democratic countries with brotherly friendship, stand together on the front line of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strive for the glorious, great, and victorious struggle for the lasting peace of the world and the safety and happiness of mankind."

A spokesman for the China Democratic League stated: "Generalissimo Stalin answered questions of an international political nature raised by a Pravda reporter on the 16th of this month. Those views are absolutely brilliant and absolutely correct." The spokesman said: "The entire aggressive bloc headed by the United States is engaging in the trick of expanding armaments every day. What European army, what unified European army, what arming of Japan and West Germany—they have made the world a miasma. Acheson, Eisenhower, Dulles—this large group of warmongers are running around and making noise. On the other hand, we only hear news from the Soviet Union about building hydroelectric stations on the Volga, Don, and Amu Darya rivers; we only hear news about lowering the prices of consumer goods, etc. Who wants peace and who wants war—the facts have provided a powerful answer to this question."

Regarding Generalissimo Stalin's statement that "if Britain and the United States finally reject the peaceful proposals of the Chinese People's Government, then the Korean War can only end in the failure of the interventionists," the spokesman said: "This is not some mysterious prophecy; the imperialists need not be overly apprehensive in trying to speculate and conjecture. Stalin is simply frankly pointing out an inevitable fact: in human history, just wars always achieve final victory; unjust wars, wars of aggression, always end in failure. U.S. imperialism, since launching the wars of aggression against Korea and China, has failed in the past, is failing now, and will inevitably fail completely in the future."

Finally, regarding Generalissimo Stalin's assertion on maintaining world peace, the spokesman said: "Generalissimo Stalin's words are the truth. He is encouraging peace-loving people around the world to shoulder our responsibilities." The spokesman used a common saying as a metaphor: peace is the "Tao," and war is the "demon." He said: "We peace-loving people will surely be able to make this world a place where 'the Tao rises one foot higher than the demon rises one inch.'"

A spokesman for the China National Democratic Construction Association stated: "At this crucial time, such a historic talk by Generalissimo Stalin, the helmsman of the world peace camp, will have extremely important effects on defending peace and resisting aggression. Upon hearing the kind and firm voice of this great international friend, the Chinese people will, with redoubled efforts and confidence, conduct the sacred cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending our homes and country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, we must wage unremitting struggle against U.S. imperialism arming Japan, until complete victory is achieved."

A spokesman for the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a statement in support of Stalin's call to safeguard peace, pointing out: "Regarding the Korean War, Generalissimo Stalin pointed out that the key to victory or defeat lies in the justice or injustice of the war participants, not in the superiority or inferiority of the generals and officers. This also illustrates that the Chinese and Korean people are bound to win, while the U.S. and British aggressive bloc is bound to lose." The spokesman's statement said: "We believe that the most important point is that Generalissimo Stalin pointed out that 'if the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and protect this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated.' A world war is avoidable."

The statement concluded by expressing full support for Generalissimo Stalin's call and pledging to lead all members, mobilize the masses, earnestly study this great call, resolutely take practical action, deepen patriotic education, strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, actively launch the struggle against arming Japan and arming West Germany, and mobilize all forces to safeguard world peace and strive for the ultimate victory against imperialist aggression.

Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, issued a statement stating: "The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party fully recognizes the importance of Generalissimo Stalin's talk and will call on party members nationwide to study this great historical document and move forward along the correct path of struggle indicated in this document. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the whole country, the people of the Soviet Union, the people of Korea, and the people of all people's democratic countries on the front line of the struggle for world peace, accelerate support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, intensify the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, oppose arming Japan, and defend world peace, and strive to continue to prevent war and maintain world peace!"

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, wrote an article in support of Generalissimo Stalin's talk. The article stated: "This talk represents the great will of all the people in the world who yearn for peace and are fighting for peace and justice." He said that Stalin warmly supported the Chinese People's Government's peaceful proposals on the Korean issue. And pointed out that the U.S. imperialist aggressors rejected this fair and reasonable proposal, and the Korean War must "end in the failure of the interventionists." The article concluded: "All members of our Jiusan Society and colleagues in the national cultural, educational, and academic circles will certainly take concrete action to respond to this great call of Generalissimo Stalin: 'A broad movement to maintain peace, as a tool to expose the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers,' and do our best to defeat all the aggressive plans of the imperialist bloc headed by U.S. imperialism."

The statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League said: "This talk thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of the imperialist aggressive group that controls the United Nations, and made a righteous support and a great call to the peace-loving people of the world." And stated: "The youth of all China will respond to Stalin's great call with more determined and courageous actions, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's rearming of Japan, support Korea, defend the motherland, and defend the peace and security of Asia and the world."

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying: "This is the most brilliant and correct instruction on the current international situation, and the Chinese working class is determined to move forward along the path pointed out by Stalin." The statement said: "We call on the entire Chinese working class to unite and oppose the new war conspiracy of the imperialist aggressive group. We must drive the American aggressors who dare to reject the peaceful proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China out of Korea in the end, and liberate our territory of Taiwan. We must resolutely oppose the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to rearm Japan and arm West Germany! Today, the strength of peace-loving people all over the world is much stronger than the strength of imperialist aggression. As long as the people of the world unite and launch a broad movement to maintain peace, it is possible to thwart the imperialist war plan."

The All-China Democratic Women's Federation commented on Generalissimo Stalin's talk: "This talk has extremely important significance for the just struggle against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea that China is currently waging." "Chinese women, from the painful experience of suffering from the aggression war of Japanese imperialism in the past, can more deeply understand the importance of this talk. Women and mothers throughout China are determined to combine their intensified support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army with their daily work, and take practical and effective actions to defend peace."

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, expressed his feelings, and Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, made a speech, both stating that they would mobilize all Chinese youth and students to step up support for the Chinese and Korean people's armies, continue to launch the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and oppose the United States' arming of Japan. And will unite the youth and students of Asia and the world to fight to the end in response to Stalin's call to maintain peace.

The statement of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: "The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the national literary and art workers fully recognize the importance of Generalissimo Stalin's call. Our literary and art workers will use the powerful weapon of literature and art to expose the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. We swear to stand with the people of the whole country on the front line of the struggle for lasting world peace, and bury the invaders in the graves they have found themselves!"

　　各民主党派、人民团体坚决拥护斯大林谈话        
    坚决扩大抗美援朝运动反对美帝武装日本        
    动员一切力量响应维护世界和平的号召
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、九三学社、中国新民主主义青年团及全国总工会、全国妇联、全国青联、全国学联、全国文联等党派、团体，纷纷发表书面意见或声明，拥护斯大林大元帅关于国际形势的谈话。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发表谈话称：“斯大林大元帅，就当前国际形势对真理报记者发表的谈话，是在帝国主义战争贩子们所造成的紧张国际局势中一个令人感到兴奋和喜悦的福音。他无情地揭露了以美帝为首的帝国主义侵略者扩大战争的计划与阴谋，并向全世界一切爱好和平的人民指出了拯救和巩固和平的正确道路。并使全世界人民包括资本主义国家内的人民，明白了谁是要战争，谁是要和平；谁是侵略者，谁是反抗侵略者。”谈话中表示：“中国国民党革命委员会对于斯大林大元帅这一重要谈话，极为重视，并要号召全体党员和全国人民一起在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，加强我们的战斗力量，坚定我们的战斗意志，决与帝国主义战争贩子们斗争到底，来保卫我们的祖国；并以兄弟般的友情和苏联人民、朝鲜人民以及各人民民主国家的人民忠诚合作，共同站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的前线上，为全世界的持久和平与人类安全幸福作光荣伟大胜利的奋斗。”
    中国民主同盟发言人的谈话称：“斯大林大元帅在本月十六日答复了真理报记者提出的有关国际政治性质的问题。那些见解是绝对英明的，而且是绝对正确的。”发言人说：“以美国为首的整个侵略集团，天天在搞扩军的把戏。什么欧洲军，什么欧洲统一军，什么武装日本和西德，它们把世界搞得乌烟瘴气。艾奇逊、艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯这一大批战争贩子东奔西跑，闹个不休。另一方面，我们从苏联只听到建设伏尔加河，顿河，阿姆·达里亚河水力电站的消息；只听到了减低消费品价格的消息等等。谁要和平，谁要战争，事实已为这问题做了有力的回答了。”
    关于斯大林大元帅所说“如果英国和美国终于拒绝了中国人民政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终”这句话，发言人说：“这不是什么神秘的预言，帝国主义者们大可不必过分惶恐地去推敲揣测。斯大林只是坦白地指明了一个必然的事实：在人类历史上，正义的战争总是得到最后胜利的；非正义的战争，侵略的战争，最后总是失败的。美帝国主义者自发动侵朝侵华战争以来，过去已经失败了，现在正在失败中，将来还是要彻底的失败。”
    最后，谈到斯大林大元帅对维护世界和平的论断时，发言人说：“斯大林大元帅的话是真理。他在鼓励我们全世界爱好和平的人民来担负我们的责任。”发言人用俗语作了一个比喻：和平是“道”，战争是“魔”。他说：“我们爱好和平的人民，今天必定能使这个世界成为‘魔高一尺’，‘道高一丈’的世界。”
    民主建国会发言人发表谈话称：“在这一个紧要的时期，世界和平阵营的舵手斯大林大元帅发表这样一个历史性的谈话，对于保卫和平、反抗侵略是会有极其重大的作用的。中国人民听到这一位伟大国际友人的慈祥而又坚定的声音，必将以加倍的努力和信心，在中国共产党领导之下，进行抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣事业；同时，要为反对美帝武装日本，展开不懈的斗争，直至完全取得胜利为止。”
    中国民主促进会发言人为拥护斯大林维护和平的号召发表谈话，指出：“斯大林大元帅就朝鲜战争指出，决定胜败的关键是战争参加者的正义与非正义，而不是将领和军官的优劣。这也就说明了中朝人民是必胜的，而美英侵略集团是必败的。发言人的谈话中说：“我们认为最重要的一点，是斯大林大元帅指明了‘如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保护到底，和平就能保持和巩固’。世界大战是可能避免的。”
    谈话最后表示，完全拥护斯大林大元帅的号召，并要领导全体会员，推动群众，认真学习这一伟大号召。坚决以实际行动，深入爱国主义教育，加强抗美援朝工作，积极展开反对武装日本和武装西德的斗争，动员一切力量来保卫世界和平，为争取反对帝国主义侵略的永远胜利而奋斗到底。
    中国农工民主党中央执行委员会主席章伯钧发表声明称：“中国农工民主党充分认识斯大林大元帅谈话的重要性，将号召全国党员学习这一伟大的历史文献，向这一文献中所指出的正确奋斗途径迈进。在中国共产党领导下，和全国人民，苏联人民，朝鲜人民，各人民民主国家人民并肩站在为世界和平而奋斗的最前线，加紧支援中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军，加紧抗美援朝，反对武装日本和保卫世界和平，为继续防止战争，维护世界和平而奋斗到底！”
    九三学社主席许德珩撰文拥护斯大林大元帅的谈话。该文称：“这一个谈话代表了全世界渴望和平并为和平与正义而斗争的人们的伟大意志。”他说，斯大林热烈地支持中国人民政府关于朝鲜问题的和平建议。并指出美帝侵略者拒绝这个公正合理的建议，朝鲜战争必“以干涉者的失败而告终”。该文最后称：“我们九三学社的全体社员和全国文化教育学术界同人一定以具体行动来响应斯大林大元帅这一伟大号召：‘广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具’，并以全力打败以美帝为首的帝国主义集团的一切侵略计划。”
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会的声明中说：“这个谈话彻底揭露了操纵着联合国的帝国主义侵略集团的阴谋，对全世界爱好和平的人民作了正义的支援和伟大的号召。”并表示：“全中国青年将以更坚决、更英勇的行动来响应斯大林的伟大号召，坚决反对美帝重新武装日本、支援朝鲜、保卫祖国、保卫亚洲与世界的和平与安全。”
    中华全国总工会发表声明说：“这是对目前国际形势的最英明最正确的指示，中国工人阶级坚决照着斯大林所指出的道路前进。”声明说：“我们号召全中国工人阶级团结起来，一致反对帝国主义侵略集团的新战争阴谋。我们要把敢于拒绝我中华人民共和国中央人民政府和平建议的美国侵略者最后赶出朝鲜，并解放我国的领土台湾。我们要坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本与武装西德的阴谋！今天全世界爱好和平人民的力量，比起帝国主义侵略的力量要强大得多，只要全世界人民团结起来，开展广泛的维护和平运动，就可能挫败帝国主义的战争计划。”
    中华全国民主妇女联合会对斯大林大元帅谈话发表意见称：“这一谈话对于中国正在进行的抗美援朝的正义斗争，更具有极端重要的意义。”“中国妇女，从过去饱受日本帝国主义侵略战争的痛苦经验中，更能深刻认识这一谈话的重要性。全中国的妇女与母亲们，誓必以加紧支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，把抗美援朝运动和日常工作紧相结合，用实际有效的行动来保卫和平。”
    中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志发表感想，中华全国学生联合会主席谢邦定发表谈话，均表示，将动员全中国青年和学生，加紧支援中朝人民军队，继续展开抗美援朝运动，反对美国武装日本。并将团结亚洲及世界青年学生，为响应斯大林维护和平的号召而奋斗到底。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会的声明称：“中华全国文学艺术界联合会暨全国文学艺术工作者充分认识到斯大林大元帅的号召的重要性。我们文学艺术工作者更将以文学艺术的有力武器，揭露帝国主义的侵略阴谋。我们誓和全国人民站在为世界永久和平而奋斗的最前线，把侵略者埋葬在自己找到的坟墓里！”
