Domestic Art and Literary Developments

　　The China National Fine Arts Workers Association recently received approximately four hundred New Year pictures from various regions across the country. The New Year pictures from several regions have improved compared to last year's output. For instance, the creative attitude is more serious, there has been more technical refinement, and the subject matter focuses on the fresh and new aspects of the growing New China, etc. However, the works from quite a few regions are still stuck at their original level. In order to expand art promotion activities and facilitate the exchange of experiences in New Year picture work across regions, the National Art Association is currently preparing a "National 1951 New Year Picture Exhibition."

　　The Shanghai literary and art circles held a large-scale joint performance during this year's Spring Festival. Participants included professional literary and art groups and amateur literary and art groups composed of workers and students, totaling more than twenty units and approximately four to five thousand people. The content included drama, folk art, music, and dance, among others. The performance lasted for about half a month. In just three days, the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month, nearly 300,000 spectators attended the performances at the Great World, the Great New Company, and the Sun Sun Company. Two points are worth noting about this performance: First, the performance was to express appreciation for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to start a climax of patriotic literary and artistic movement. During the performance, many new works appeared advocating resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. Among them, many were very popular with the audience. Second, the performance venues were mainly concentrated in places of entertainment for the working people, such as the Great World, the Great New, and the Sun Sun, which is a manifestation of the Shanghai literary and art circles implementing the policy of popularizing literary and artistic movement and taking propaganda work into the masses.

　　The "Popular Edition of Soviet Literature Series" compiled by the Kaiming Bookstore has recently published five titles: "The Iron Flood" (rewritten by Zhang Kai), "Cement" (rewritten by Qin Shuwen), "Virgin Soil Upturned" (rewritten by Sun Huang), "By the River Sot" (rewritten by Tao Jun), and "Time, Forward!" (rewritten by Xue Chang). Forthcoming titles include: "Grain" (rewritten by Zhu Guanghui), "The Ordeal" (rewritten by Qian Jiabiao), "The Young Guard" (rewritten by Fang Dan), "A Real Man" (rewritten by Tu Wen), "The Artamonov Business" (rewritten by Min Junli), etc. This series is entirely based on rewrites of Soviet novels. It can provide great convenience to people who are not used to translations or do not have enough time to read, and publishing such series is a meaningful endeavor in the popularization of literature and art work at present.

　　国内文艺动态
    中华全国美术工作者协会最近接到从各地寄来国内的新年画约四百幅。有不少地区的年画较去年的出品提高了一步。比如：创作态度都比较严肃，技术上也有了更多的加工，取材上重视了新中国成长中的新鲜事物等等。但也有不少地区的作品还停留在原有的水平上面。全国美协为了扩大美术宣传活动，并促进各地新年画工作经验的交流，现正筹备“全国一九五一年新年画展览会”。
    上海文艺界在今年春节举办大规模的联合演出。参加者有各专业文艺团体和工人、学生组成的业余文艺团体，共二十多个单位，约四、五千人。内容包括戏剧、曲艺、音乐、舞蹈等。演出时间约半个多月。仅仅本月六日、七日、八日三天，在大世界、大新公司、先施公司三处，观众近三十万人。这次演出有两点值得重视：一、这次演出是为了慰劳朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，掀起爱国主义文艺运动的高潮。在演出中，出现了许多抗美援朝、保家卫国的新作品。其中，有不少很受观众欢迎。二、演出地址主要集中在大世界、大新、先施等劳动人民游乐的场所，这是上海文艺界执行文艺普及运动方针、把宣传工作深入群众中去的一个表现。
    开明书店编的《通俗本苏联文学丛书》，最近已出版《铁流》（章恺改写）、《水门汀》（秦淑文改写）、《垦荒》（孙惶改写）、《索特河边》（陶均改写）、《时间、前进呀！》（薛昶改写）五种，即将出版的有：《粮食》（朱光辉改写）、《考验》（钱家标改写）、《青年近卫军》（方丹改写）《真正的人》（屠文改写）、《一个家庭的兴衰》（闵君立改写）等，这一套丛书全是依据苏联的长篇小说重写的，它可以给看不惯译文或者没有充分时间阅读的人以很大便利，在文艺普及工作上，目前出版这类性质的丛书是一有意义的工作。
