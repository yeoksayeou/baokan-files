Reducing Students' Physical Burden and Striving to Improve Students' Health
    Liu Jiping
    The broad masses of young students in China are an important force in the great Chinese people's revolutionary movement. Their heroic fighting spirit was not only prominently displayed in the "May Fourth" Movement and the "December 9th" Movement, but also in the Great Revolution of 1925-27, the Ten-Year Land Revolutionary War, the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War in recent years. They have all made countless commendable and moving achievements. Recently, in the new upsurge of the anti-American and patriotic movement, our young students have further enhanced their political awareness and, together with other young people across the country, jointly resisted the United States and aided Korea, and defended their homes and the country, playing a significant role. After the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission issued a call for recruiting young workers and students to participate in various military cadre schools, the broad masses of young workers and students immediately launched a vigorous registration campaign. In the future, they will undoubtedly become excellent cadres in the cause of national defense construction of our great motherland. This is the supreme glory of Chinese youth.
    At present, although the general youth students in our country have a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, their physical fitness is generally not strong enough. The number of students in various regions who signed up to participate in military cadre schools generally reached about 20 to 60 percent of the eligible students, and the number of people who failed the physical examination in various regions also accounted for about 10 to 50 percent of the number of applicants. This is indeed a serious problem that cannot be ignored. It not only shows that many young students are not physically strong, but also reflects the poor health of the people of our country.
    This poor health condition is basically the result of the long-term aggression against our country by imperialism and the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. In the past, under the multiple oppressions and devastations of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, the broad masses of people were generally trapped in poverty, hunger, malnutrition, and extremely poor sanitary conditions, which could not but affect the health of the broad masses of young people. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries consistently implemented their anti-people and counter-revolutionary education policies in schools at all levels, not only ignoring the general phenomenon of poor health among young students, but also deliberately overwhelming students with heavy homework and examination systems; using feudal and backward ideas and American lifestyles to guide students to a state of depression; directly and indirectly causing various diseases such as nearsightedness, stomach problems, heart disease, tuberculosis, and neurasthenia, which made the health of young students deteriorate day by day.
    Since the liberation of the mainland of China, the central and local people's governments have attached importance to this issue. In order to consolidate and build a great motherland, the people's government believes that it is necessary not only to develop production and strengthen national defense, but also to strive for the health of the people; it believes that people's schools should not only provide students with political, cultural, and scientific education, but also pay special attention to efforts to reduce student illness. Therefore, it has repeatedly proposed simplifying courses in various subjects to reduce the burden on students; advocating sports activities to improve students' health. In some regions and schools, some preliminary measures have been taken and certain achievements have been made. However, some regions and schools have not yet paid serious attention to it. Therefore, until today, the general health of students has rarely made significant progress.
    Why has such an important issue not been widely valued in many places? The main reason is certainly because there are many difficulties and a thorough solution cannot be achieved in a short period of time, but some people's lack of understanding of the importance of youth health is also a major factor.
    Some people think that health is only a matter for individuals and do not understand that disease in an individual harms the country; they do not fully understand that this is one of the fundamental issues of the entire nation.
    Some people think that health care is a matter for the medical and health departments, and that the task of schools is only to teach people to learn. Therefore, they blindly emphasize politics and culture, and arbitrarily increase courses and activities, completely disregarding or rarely caring for the health of students; when students fall ill, they blame the poor medical conditions. They do not understand that physical exercise is one of the basic tasks of people's education. If a group of talented people are painstakingly cultivated, but most of them are weak and sick and cannot bear heavy responsibilities, what a great loss that would be!
    Some people say: Health is very important, but this is the misfortune left over by the Kuomintang; at present, the country's financial and economic situation has not fundamentally improved, and it is temporarily impossible to solve it. In this way, all possible and necessary subjective efforts today are completely negated: things that should be done are not done, money that should not be saved is forcibly saved, and even problems that can be solved are not solved. In fact, although there are many difficulties today, some problems can still be solved immediately, and some problems can be gradually improved through efforts. At the same time, it must be noted that the health of students is of great importance to the country's education and construction undertakings.
    On the other hand, some people completely disregard the current economic difficulties of the country and believe that everything requires money; to solve the health problems of students, the government should spend more money. In fact, the occurrence of some phenomena is mainly not due to the presence or absence of money, but due to our own shortcomings and mistakes in our work; although some things can only be solved with certain material conditions, they are by no means only dependent on money. Moreover, even with money, we must be good at planning, and if there is not enough money, we can still think of some economical solutions.
    In order to overcome the above ideological obstacles and mobilize educational workers across the country to wage a resolute struggle against this serious phenomenon left by domestic and foreign enemies, the Central Ministry of Education, at the preparatory meeting of the recently held secondary education conference, discussed this issue as a special issue; and will further study practical and feasible specific methods. We believe that we should first seriously simplify courses in various subjects and various extracurricular activities, and at the same time promote sports activities. At present, the burden on the broad masses of young students is too heavy, the courses and exercises are too complicated, extracurricular activities are too numerous, and the improvement of teaching methods and examination systems is still insufficient, which makes most students not have enough time to participate in sports activities and cultural and recreational activities; even the time for sleep is insufficient. We suggest that in the future, various times must be strictly stipulated: the number of class hours per week shall not exceed 30 hours, self-study and reading shall not exceed 18 hours, extracurricular meetings and other activities shall not exceed 6 to 12 hours, daily sports and entertainment shall not be less than one hour, and sleep shall not be less than eight to nine hours. In order to ensure the implementation of this system, the content of classes, homework, and extracurricular activities must be simplified with the greatest determination. The past malpractice of superficially reducing time while actually increasing the amount must be effectively corrected. Secondly, the minimum sanitary and nutritional conditions should also be gradually improved. Some schools have suffered great damage in the past, with overcrowded houses, incomplete doors and windows, insufficient light, incomplete beds and desks, poor medical conditions, and poor food. These have a great impact on students' health. We suggest that the government and the people, teachers and students must work together to determine the direction of improvement based on local material conditions and the country's financial situation, distinguish between priorities and urgencies, create experience in various ways, and strive to gradually find solutions in a few years. It is indeed difficult to solve these things universally at present, so we cannot ask for too much; but we must never wait blindly or ignore them.
    To achieve the above requirements, we must rely on a most fundamental condition: that is, everyone's high sense of responsibility for the health of the broad masses of young people and the entire nation. As long as everyone realizes that this is one of the important keys to consolidating and building a great motherland, and pays attention to creating and improving health conditions everywhere, then everything that should be done and can be done will definitely be done gradually.
    Local governments, party committees, youth leagues, school administrative organs, health organs, teacher and student groups should regard improving the health of students as a serious political and educational task, immediately study specific methods, and actively promote them. Students across the country, especially middle school students who are in the stage of development, should also automatically, consciously, in an organized and planned manner, strive to develop reasonable living habits, strengthen physical exercise, in order to reduce diseases and protect health.

　　减轻学生体力负担，争取改善学生健康情况
    刘季平
    中国的广大青年学生，是伟大的中国人民革命运动中的一支重要的力量。他们的英勇斗争精神不但在“五四”运动和“一二九”运动中有了突出的表现，而且，在一九二五——二七年大革命、十年土地革命战争、八年抗日战争和近几年的人民解放战争中，他们都曾经做出了无数可歌可泣的事迹。最近在反美爱国运动的新高潮中，我国青年学生又进一步提高了政治觉悟和全国其他青年群众在一起，共同抗美援朝，保家卫国，起了很大作用。中央人民政府政务院和人民革命军事委员会发出关于招收青年工人青年学生参加各种军事干部学校的号召之后，广大的青年工人和青年学生立即展开了如火如荼的报名运动。今后在我们伟大祖国的国防建设事业中，他们将毫无疑义地成为优秀的干部。这是中国青年的无上光荣。
    目前我国一般青年学生，虽然有高度的爱国热情，但是，他们的体格一般的却都不够强壮。这次各地报名参加军事干部学校的学生数一般都达到适龄学生的百分之二十至六十左右，而身体不合格的人数，在各地也差不多都要占报名人数的百分之十至五十左右。这实在是一个不容忽视的严重问题。它不仅说明了很多青年学生身体不强，而且反映了我国人民的健康状况的不良。
    这种不良的健康状况基本上是由于过去帝国主义对我国的长期侵略和国民党反动黑暗统治所造成的恶果。过去在帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义的重重压榨与摧残下面，广大人民普遍陷于贫困、饥饿、营养不良和卫生条件极端恶劣的情况中，这就不能不影响到广大青年的健康。加之国民党反动派在各级学校里一贯实行其反人民反革命的教育政策，非但漠视青年学生健康不良的普遍现象，而且故意用繁重功课和会考制度把学生压得喘不过气来；用封建落后思想和美国生活方式把学生引导到痿靡不振的道路上去；直接间接地造成种种疾病如近视、胃病、心脏病、肺结核和神经衰弱等，使青年学生的健康状况日益恶化。
    全国大陆解放以来，中央与各地人民政府对于这一问题是重视的。为了巩固与建设伟大的祖国，人民政府认为不仅要发展生产，加强国防，还要为人民的健康而奋斗；认为人民的学校不仅要给学生以政治、文化、和科学的教育，还要特别注意为减少学生疾病而努力。因此曾一再提出精简各科课程，以减轻学生负担；提倡体育运动，以增进学生健康。在部分地区和学校里，已经采取了若干初步措施，并且获得了一定的成绩。但有些地区和学校，则至今仍未认真加以注意。所以到今天为止，一般学生的健康情形，很少有显著进步。
    这样重大的问题，为什么在许多地方还未普遍加以重视呢？其主要原因固然是因为困难很多，短期间不能彻底求得解决，但有些人对青年健康问题的重要性认识不足，也有很大关系。
    有人以为健康问题只是各人自己的事，不了解病在个人，害在国家；没有充分了解这是整个民族的根本问题之一。
    有人以为保健问题是医药卫生部门的事，学校的任务只是教人学习，因而一味强调政治与文化，任意加重课程与活动，完全不照顾或很少照顾学生的健康；等到学生病倒了，又专怪医药条件太差。他们不了解体格锻炼正是人民教育的基本任务之一。如果辛辛苦苦培养出一批人才，大都体弱多病，不能任重致远，那是何等重大的损失！
    有人说：健康问题是很重要的，可是这是国民党留下来的祸害；目前国家财政经济状况尚未根本好转，暂时还无法解决。这样，便完全否定了今天一切可能与必要的主观努力：该做的事不做，不该省的钱硬省，连可以解决的问题也不给以解决。其实今天虽有很多困难，但有些问题还是可以立即解决，有些问题也可以经过努力而逐步加以改善的。同时，必须注意：学生的健康问题对于国家的教育事业和建设事业都有重大的关系。
    另一方面，也有人完全不照顾当前国家的经济困难，认为一切非钱莫办，要解决学生的健康问题，政府就得多拿钱出来。其实有些现象的发生，主要不是由于钱的有无，而是由于我们自己在工作上的缺点和过失；有些事情虽然要有一定的物质条件才能解决，但也决不是仅仅依靠钱就行的。而且有了钱还要善于打算，钱不够还可以想些穷办法。
    为了克服上述的思想障碍，动员全国教育工作者对国内外敌人所留下的这一严重现象作坚决的斗争，中央教育部在最近召开的中等教育会议预备会上，把这一问题作为一个专门问题加以讨论；并将进一步研究切实可行的具体办法。我们认为首先应该认真精简各科课程与各种课外活动，同时提倡体育运动。现在广大青年学生的负担实在太重，课程与习题太繁，课外活动过多，教学方法与考试制度的改进尚嫌不够，因而就使大部分学生没有足够的时间参加体育活动和文化娱乐活动；甚至连睡眠的时间也不足。我们建议；今后必须严格规定各种时间，每周上课时数不得超过三十小时，自修与阅读不得超过十八小时，课外的会议等活动不得超过六至十二小时，每日运动与文娱不得少于一小时，睡眠不得少于八至九小时。为了保证这一制度的贯彻执行，上课，作业，与课外活动的内容必须下最大决心予以精简。过去表面减少时间实际加重分量的弊病，必须切实纠正。其次，最低限度的卫生条件和营养条件，也要逐步设法改进。有些学校过去遭受很大破坏，房屋太挤，门窗不全，光线不足，床铺桌椅不齐，医药条件很差，伙食太坏。这些对学生健康的影响都是很大的。我们建议：必须由政府与人民、先生与学生通力合作，视当地物质条件与国家财政情况，确定改进方向，分别轻重缓急，多方创造经验，争取在若干年内，逐步求得解决。这些事，目前要普遍解决，确有不少困难，因此不能要求过急；但决不能一味等待或置之不问。
    要实现上述各项要求，一定要依靠一个最根本的条件：即是大家对广大青年以及整个民族的健康问题的高度负责精神。只要大家都认识到这是巩固与建设伟大祖国的重要关键之一，处处注意到创造和改进健康条件，则一切应该办到和可以办到的事情，就一定能逐步办好。
    各地政府、党委员会、青年团、学校行政机关、卫生机关、教师与学生团体，都应该把改善学生的健康状况看作是严重的政治任务和教育任务，立即研究具体办法，积极加以推行。全国学生，特别是正处在发育时期的中等学校学生，也应该自动、自觉、有组织、有计划地努力养成合理的生活习惯，加强体格锻炼，以求减少疾病，保护健康。
