　　The Two Paths of the Japanese Nation
    Zhuang Tao
    In late January of this year, the war-monger Dulles, dispatched to Japan by Truman, left Japan on February 11 after holding multiple talks with MacArthur and Yoshida, the head of the Japanese reactionary government, and reaching some tacit understanding. During this period, the US imperialists and the traitorous Japanese elements had clearly negotiated a black market deal that could not be made public to the people of the world. This is: The traitorous Japanese government accepted the US imperialist's aggressive plan to rearm Japan to serve as cannon fodder for the United States; the traitorous Japanese government also agreed that after a separate peace treaty with the US imperialists, it would conclude a "US-Japan military alliance," which would stipulate the long-term occupation of Japan by US forces; under the above conditions, the United States would bear part of the expenses for Japan's rearmament. Therefore, Yoshida was extremely secretive about the content of this meeting, even to the Japanese bourgeoisie's parliament. Even Japan's largest bourgeois news agency, Kyodo News, believes that: "The Prime Minister's answers and debates were extremely evasive in both houses... The Prime Minister seems determined to strictly seal off the contents of the Tokyo talks."
    The US imperialists' conspiracy to rearm Japan has aroused widespread opposition from people of all walks of life. The "Comprehensive Peace Treaty Patriotic Movement Council," recently organized by more than sixty democratic political parties and groups in Japan, including the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Justice Faction of the Socialist Party, issued an open letter to Dulles in late January, stating: "The Japanese working people oppose a separate peace treaty and rearmament." Dulles himself, in a statement to reporters in Canberra, the capital of Australia, on February 15, had to admit: "In Japan, I received thousands upon thousands of letters from individuals or groups... All of these letters oppose rearmament." Moreover, even within the Japanese ruling class, there is fear of war and hidden worries about Japan's future. Significant confusion has therefore arisen within the Japanese ruling class.
    When the United States revealed its decision to send Dulles to Japan, the largest bourgeois newspaper in Japan, the Asahi Shimbun, published an article on January 14 stating: "A separate peace treaty... will bring many difficulties to Japan, difficulties that may lead to a serious crisis and may once again subject a Japan whose wounds have not yet fully healed to another misfortune." This reflects that within the Japanese ruling class, apart from a few comprador capitalists and their agents who are willing to follow the US imperialists and sell out national interests, the broad middle class feels uneasy about the US imperialists driving Japan onto the path of war.
    For the five and a half years since the end of the anti-fascist war, Japan has been increasingly reduced to a US military base and colony. The original purpose of the US participation in the Pacific anti-fascist war was not to eliminate Japanese fascism, but to replace Japanese fascism and make itself the master of Asia. Therefore, when Japanese fascism was defeated, the US imperialists shamelessly stole the huge price paid by the Asian people, mainly the Chinese people, in defeating Japanese fascism, and made Japan an accomplice in its enslavement of the Eastern people. Therefore, as the US imperialists' control over Japan gradually deepened, the tendency for Japanese militarism to revive became increasingly obvious.
    The United States' post-war ambitious plan to become the master of Asia is being implemented with Japan as its base and with the direction of the Japanese ruling class. This plan first includes: turning Japan into a military base for the United States to oppose the Soviet Union and communism and to enslave the Eastern people; and turning Japan into a US Far East factory that can accommodate the United States' surplus goods and capital and exploit the Eastern people. However, this plan itself contains insurmountable contradictions, forming the crisis and decline of Japanese capitalism after the war.
    Because the path taken by the Japanese landlords and bourgeoisie for half a century has been the path of war, the path of slaughtering and enslaving the Chinese people, and also the path of exploiting and suppressing the Japanese people, the economic structure of Japanese capitalism has always been highly dependent on overseas. Specifically, no capitalist country has ever been as deeply dependent on foreign trade as Japan. In 1936, Japan's total exports accounted for 22.4 percent of its national income; in the same year, the United States accounted for only 3.7 percent; and even the United Kingdom, which had the highest degree of dependence on overseas, accounted for only 18.2 percent. This also illustrates the poverty of the Japanese people and the narrowness of the domestic market during long-term wars of aggression. After the US imperialists entered Japan, in order to alleviate the panic caused by its own surplus production, they exported a large amount of surplus goods to Japan, occupying the Japanese market. In 1949, 64 percent of Japan's import trade came from the United States. This further deepened Japan's dependence on foreign markets. But where can Japan find a market? The US market will certainly not be opened to Japan; in 1949, the United States accounted for only 16 percent of Japan's export trade. Trade with China is also being hindered in various ways by the United States in order to ensure that its high-priced surplus goods can be sold in Japan. Thus, Japan can only find a way out in the sterling area of Southeast Asia, which is a fundamental reason for the post-war contradictions between Britain and the United States on the Japanese issue. In order to maintain its controlled market, British imperialism is of course squeezing out Japan's import trade, thus causing difficulties for Japan's exports. As of 1949, Japan's post-war trade deficit had reached US$1.37 billion, with an average annual deficit equivalent to one-seventh of Japan's expenditure that year.
    Japan's export difficulties, in turn, will inevitably affect Japan's ability to digest US surplus goods. Therefore, in order for goods made up of US raw materials, capital, and Japan's cheap labor to break through the tariff barriers of the sterling area, the United States has no choice but to engage in dumping. Since 1949, the essence of the Dodge Line policy promoted by the United States in Japan has been to force Japan to implement "starvation exports." On the one hand, it increased taxes, tightened currency, and stabilized prices to "stabilize" the chaotic state of the Japanese economy at the time, clearing the way for US private capital to invest in Japan. At the same time, it lowered rice prices; lowered wages; emphasized rationalization of operations, increased workers' labor intensity; and reorganized enterprises, using state power to provide all conveniences related to obtaining raw materials, power, and capital to huge monopolistic enterprises with "high efficiency," in order to create Japan's "starvation exports." As a result, this has brought great difficulties to the Japanese economy.
    After the autumn of 1949, the evils of the Dodge Line policy began to be fully exposed in all sectors of the Japanese economy, creating overproduction built on the extreme poverty of the Japanese people. This manifested itself in stockpiles, falling prices, rural bankruptcy, worker unemployment, and the massive closure of small and medium-sized enterprises. In 1949 alone, three-tenths of the small and medium-sized enterprises across Japan, about 270,000 factories, were forced to go bankrupt, shut down, or change careers. Even the Nagoya Daido Steel Company, which had 10,000 workers, had to close its doors. As a result, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Japan reached 12 million last spring, accounting for one-seventh of the total population.
    After the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea last June, Japan became not only the naval and air base for the US military invading Korea, but also the most accessible logistical supply base for the US military near the battlefield, which alleviated Japan's economic crisis to a partial and temporary extent. However, new contradictions and difficulties soon emerged. This is the insurmountable contradiction between the US expansion of armaments and the Japanese military industry regarding the supply of strategic resources.
    As everyone knows, in addition to its narrow domestic market, Japan is also a country that is extremely short of raw materials. After the US war of aggression against Korea, the world's imperialist camp competed to expand their armaments, causing world military supply prices to skyrocket; at the same time, countries have gradually restricted the export of strategic materials for their own needs. For example, from June to October last year, the price of US scrap steel rose from $30 to $44 per ton, an increase of 46 percent. The United States also gradually restricted the export of scrap steel, non-ferrous metals, cotton, etc. On the other hand, the US imperialists purchased a large number of military supplies in Japan at low prices to supply the war of aggression against Korea. As a result, Japan is experiencing a raw material panic.
    The steel industry is the foundation of all industries. Due to the raw material panic, Japan's production plan of 4 million tons of steel this year is facing difficulties. According to estimates by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, by the end of March this year, the stock of imported iron ore will be only 4,700 tons, enough for only half a day's use. Therefore, the Yoshida government formulated an emergency import plan for strategic materials for January to March of this year. But even if raw materials can be bought from abroad, the transport ships are also a problem. Kawada Shige, president of the Nippon Kokan K.K. which is part of the Yasuda zaibatsu, said at the New Year's Round Table Conference held by the Toyo Keizai Shimposha this year: "This year, 4 million tons of iron ore need to be imported from foreign countries. Even assuming that they can be purchased in full, Japan's existing ships are not enough to transport iron ore alone." Moreover, even if US ships assist in transportation, the high cost will make Japanese capitalists shy away. On January 6, Tokyo Broadcasting said when discussing the production plan of 4 million tons of steel: "The iron ore imported from the United States has increased by 70 percent compared to the original price (referring to the price in China - translator), and the price of coal has increased by more than two times, so the price of products must increase by at least 40 percent. This will not only affect exports, but also make it difficult to supply the domestic market." Factors such as insufficient raw materials, transportation difficulties, and high costs are causing serious difficulties for the Japanese economy. Even the Special Materials Section of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry had to mention in its explanation of "US Military Special Needs": "If we do not quickly implement strong imports, then supplying special needs with insignificant basic materials and imported materials is not only 'starvation special needs' for our country, but the processing fees and profits obtained from special needs will also be absorbed by the high prices of basic materials in overseas markets, resulting in nothing." The US imperialists' policy of "wanting the horse to run fast, but not wanting the horse to eat grass" after the war of aggression against Korea has threatened the reproduction of Japanese capitalism.
    However, it is very clear that until the United States suffered a disastrous defeat in the Korean battlefield last December, although the contradictions between US monopoly capital and the Japanese ruling class continued to increase, the Japanese ruling class still had a self-comforting illusion. This is to follow the United States, take the path of war and aggression, and dream of regaining some of the lost colonies in the Third World War. After last December, although not in all of the Japanese ruling class, but at least in a considerable number of people, this ridiculous fantasy was shattered by the facts. This is what the Asahi Shimbun said in its January 14 editorial against a separate peace treaty: "The communist threat after the conclusion of a separate peace treaty cannot be eliminated and driven back by rearmament alone." In the memorandum from Japanese old fascist army generals to Yoshida and Emperor Hirohito after Dulles arrived in Japan, it was stated even more bluntly: "Japan's possible adversaries on the Asian continent are superior to Japan in terms of manpower and material potential." They have recognized the power of the people.
    Therefore, even a considerable part of the Japanese ruling class has had to see that if they continue to follow the US imperialists and take the path of armed Japan and war, not only is there no possibility of victory, but once a war is provoked, the United States will inevitably be too busy to take care of itself, which will be fatal to the island nation of Japan. At that time, not only will the raw materials for the steel industry not be supplied, but there will also be a serious panic about the problem of eating. This painful experience was felt by Japan at the end of World War II. Moreover, Japan's conditions at that time were far better than they are now. At that time, Japan had three times as many ships as it has now, and vast occupied areas just across the water that could be looted at will. Therefore, the above-mentioned memorandum of Japanese old fascist army generals gave the following answer regarding this issue: "If Japan participates in a wide-ranging Far East conflict, it will only have disastrous consequences for the Japanese nation."
    However, today in Japan, in addition to the path of war and destruction led by the United States and the traitorous Japanese government, which forces the Japanese nation to take, there is also another path, which is the new path of peace and prosperity proposed by China and the Soviet Union and enthusiastically supported by the vast majority of Japanese people - to implement a just and comprehensive peace treaty, oppose rearmament, and develop peaceful industries needed by the Japanese people.
    The Chinese and Japanese economies have always had very close ties. In 1938, the amount of Japanese exports to Taiwan, Northeast China, and the provinces within the pass accounted for 37.8 percent of Japan's total exports that year. By 1939, it had risen to 51.1 percent. The same is true for Japan's import trade. In 1936, 27 percent of Japan's required iron ore and one-third of its imports were obtained from China. Coking coal was completely dependent on China. In 1938, 83 percent of Japan's imported coal (mainly for coking) was obtained from China. In the same year, 70 percent of Japan's imported salt and 80 percent of its soybeans were all obtained from China. Of course, the deep dependence of the Japanese economy on China in the past was due to the bloody aggression of Japanese imperialism against China in the past. But since Japanese imperialism was defeated, if Japan is determined to take the new path of peaceful trade, then the Chinese people are still willing to give an outlet to Japan's peaceful industry under the conditions of equality and mutual benefit.
    At the same time, only by breaking away from its economic dependence on the United States and becoming a component part of the Asian economy again can Japan solve the fatal threats to Japanese industry that exist today, such as insufficient raw materials, transportation difficulties, and high costs, and can it completely get rid of the long-term economic crisis and embark on the road to prosperity.
    The two paths of the Japanese nation—the path of war and destruction and the path of peace and prosperity—are so clearly unfolded before all the Japanese people today. What to do next determines the death and rebirth of the Japanese nation. But today, the United States and its running dogs in Japan—the Yoshida government—are doing their best to drag Japan onto the path of war in order to suit the interests of a small group of US monopoly capitalists and Japanese comprador capitalists. In order to achieve peace and prosperity, only all patriotic people in Japan, regardless of class, party, or belief, can unite together and fight to smash the US-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan.

　　日本民族的两条道路
    庄涛
    今年一月下旬，奉杜鲁门之命赴日活动的战争贩子杜勒斯，在与麦克阿瑟及日本反动政府首脑吉田等举行多次会谈，并获致某种默契后，已于二月十一日离日。在这一期间，美帝与日本卖国贼之间，显然已商就了一宗无法在全世界人民面前公开的黑市买卖。这就是：日本卖国政府接受了美帝重新武装日本以充当美国炮灰的侵略计划；日本卖国政府同时答应在与美帝单独媾和以后，即缔结“美日军事同盟”，该同盟条约，将规定美军长期占领日本；在上述条件之下，美国担负日本重整军备的一部分费用。因此，关于此次会谈内容，吉田就是对于日本资产阶级的议会，也讳莫如深。连日本最大的资产阶级通信社——共同社，都认为：“首相的回答与辩论，在两院都是极为规避的……。首相似乎坚决严密封闭东京会谈的内容。”
    美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋，已引起各阶层人民的普遍反对。由共产党、劳农党、社会党正义派等日本六十余民主政党、团体，于最近组织的“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”，在一月下旬，发表致杜勒斯公开信说：“日本劳动人民反对单独媾和与重新武装。”杜勒斯本人，二月十五日在澳大利亚首都堪培拉对记者发表谈话时，也不得不承认：“在日本，我接到成千成万的个人或团体的信件，………所有这些信都反对重新武装。”不仅如此，就是在日本统治阶级内部，也造成了对战争的恐惧，与对日本前途的隐忧。日本统治阶级内部也因此发生了显著的混乱。
    当美国透露派遣杜勒斯去日的决定以后，日本最大的资产阶级报纸朝日新闻，即于一月十四日著文称：“个别的和约………将带给日本很多困难，这些困难可能促成严重危机，而可能再使一个创伤还没有完全恢复的日本再遭恶运。”这反映了在日本统治阶级内部，除了少数甘心追随美帝国主义，出卖民族利益的买办资本及其代理人以外，广大的中产阶层对于美帝国主义驱使日本走上战争的道路，都感到不安。
    反法西斯战争结束以后的五年半来，对于日本来说，是日益沦为美帝军事基地与殖民地的过程。本来美帝之参加太平洋反法西斯战争，其目的，并不是为了消灭日本法西斯，而是为了代替日本法西斯，使自己成为亚洲的主人。因此当日本法西斯被击溃以后，美帝国主义便可耻地窃夺亚洲人民、主要是中国人民，在击溃日本法西斯中所付出的巨大的代价，并使日本成为其奴役东方人民的帮凶。所以当美帝国主义对日本的控制逐步深入的时候，日本军国主义复活的倾向，也就逐渐明显。
    战后美国企图成为亚洲主人的狂妄计划，就是以日本为据点，并指使日本统治阶级来共同实现的。这一计划，首先包括：把日本变为美国反苏反共与奴役东方人民的军事基地；以及容纳美国过剩物资、资本的榨取东方人民的美国远东工厂。但是这一计划本身却包含着不可克服的矛盾，形成战后日本资本主义的危机与没落。
    由于半世纪来日本地主、资产阶级所走的道路，是战争的道路，是残杀和奴役中国人民的道路，同时也是榨取与镇压日本人民的道路。因此日本资本主义的经济结构，一向对海外有着高度的依赖。具体表现在没有一个资本主义国家，曾像日本那样深刻地依存于对外贸易。一九三六年，日本输出总额占国民所得的比例达百分之二十二点四；同年美国仅占百分之三点七；而对海外依存程度最高的英国，也不过百分之十八点二。这里同时也说明在长期侵略战争中日本人民的贫困与国内市场的狭隘。美帝进驻日本以后，为了缓和其本国因生产过剩而形成的恐慌，便把大量过剩物资向日本输出，霸占了日本的市场。一九四九年日本输入贸易的百分之六十四，是由美国来的。这样更加深日本对国外市场的依赖。但是日本往那里去找市场呢？美国的市场当然不会向日本开放，一九四九年美国仅占日本输出贸易的百分之十六。对中国的贸易，又因美国为保证它高价的过剩物资能在日本推销，而进行种种阻碍。这样日本只有在东南亚英镑集团找市场的出路，这也就是战后英美在日本问题上发生矛盾的一个基本原因。英帝国主义为了保持自己所控制的市场，对日本的输入贸易当然进行排挤，因而也就造成日本输出的困难。截至一九四九年，日本战后贸易入超已达十三亿七千万美元，每年平均入超数相当于该年日本岁出的七分之一。
    日本输出的困难，反过来必然影响日本对美国过剩物资的消化能力。于是，美国为使由美国原料、资金及日本廉价劳力构成的商品，能冲破英镑集团关税壁垒，便只有进行倾销一途。一九四九年以来，美国在日本推行的道奇政策的本质，便是迫使日本实行“饥饿输出”。它一面增加税收，紧缩通货，稳定物价，以“安定”当时日本经济的混乱状态，为美国私人资本投资日本廓清道路。同时压低米价；压低工资；强调经营合理化，提高工人劳动强度；并整编企业，运用国家权力，对具有“高效能”的巨大独占企业，给予一切有关取得原料、动力、资金等的便利；以造成日本的“饥饿输出”。结果给日本经济带来了莫大困难。
    一九四九年秋以后，道奇政策的恶果，开始在日本经济各部门全面地暴露出来，造成了建立在日本人民赤贫之上的生产过剩。表现为存货山积，物价下跌，农村破产，工人失业以及中小企业的大量倒闭。一九四九年一年内，日本全国有十分之三的中小企业，约二十七万家工厂，被迫破产、停闭或转业。就是拥有工人一万名的名古屋大同制钢会社，也不得不关门。因此去年春，日本全国失业与半失业人数，竟达到一千二百万人，占全人口七分之一。
    去年六月美国发动侵朝战争以后，由于美国除把日本变成侵朝美军的海空基地以外，还把日本变成美军最接近战场的军需补给基地，曾使日本经济危机获得局部的、暂时的缓和。但是不久以后，新的矛盾与困难又显露出来了。这就是美国扩张军备与日本军事工业间的、关于战略资源供应的不可克服的矛盾。
    大家都知道，日本除了国内市场狭隘以外，同时又是一个极度缺乏原料的国家。美国侵朝战争以后，世界帝国主义阵营竞相扩张军备，引起世界军需物资价格暴腾；同时各国为了本身需要，也都逐渐限制战略物资的出口。如从去年六月到十月，美国废铁由每吨三十美元涨至四十四美元，上涨了百分之四十六。美国并逐渐限制废铁、非铁金属、棉花等的出口。另方面，美帝却以低廉价格在日本搜购大批军事物资，供应侵朝战争。结果造成日本原料的恐慌。
    钢铁工业是一切工业的根本，由于原料恐慌，日本今年四百万吨钢材的生产计划正发生困难。据日本通商产业省的推算，到本年三月底，输入铁矿石存货将剩四千七百吨，仅足供半日之用。因此吉田政府制订了今年一月至三月的战略物资紧急输入计划。然即使能从海外买到原料，运输的船只也成问题。安田财阀系的日本钢管会社社长河田重，在今年日本东洋经济新报社召开的新年座谈会上说：“今年需从外国输入四百万吨铁矿石，即使假定能如数买到，日本现有的全部船舶，光用来运铁矿都不够。”而且即使由美国船只协助运输，则成本之高，也使日本资本家望而生畏。一月六日东京广播在谈及四百万吨钢材生产计划时称：“由美国输入的铁矿石，较原来价格（指中国的价格——笔者）增加百分之七十，煤的价格则增二倍以上，因此制品的价格至少要增加百分之四十。如此不但影响输出，即使供给国内也有困难。”像这样原料不足、运输困难与成本高昂等因素，正造成日本经济的严重困难。连日本通商产业省特别资材科，在关于“美军特别需要”的解释中，也不得不提到：“如不迅速实施强力输入，那末以微不足道的基础资材与输入资材来供应特需，对于我国，不仅是“饥饿特需”，而且因特需而获得的加工费与利润，也将因基础物资海外市场的价格高涨而吸收净尽，结果是一无所得。”侵朝战争以后美帝这种“又要马儿走得好，又要马儿不吃草”的政策，已迫使日本资本主义的再生产遭受威胁。
    可是很显然的，直到去年十二月美国在朝鲜战场遭受惨重打击以前，美国独占资本与日本统治阶级之间的矛盾，虽然不断增加，然日本统治阶级却还有着一个足以自我安慰的幻想。这就是追随美国，走战争侵略的道路，梦想在第三次世界大战中，捞回一部分失去的殖民地。到去年十二月以后，固然不是在所有日本统治阶级之中，但至少是在相当一部分人数之中，这一可笑的幻想是被事实所粉碎了。这就是朝日新闻在一月十四日社论中反对单独媾和时所说的：“个别和约订立以后的共党威胁，也不仅是重整军备所能消除和逐退的。”在杜勒斯抵日后日本旧法西斯陆军将领致吉田、日皇裕仁的备忘录中，更直截了当地说：“日本在亚洲大陆上的可能敌手，在人力和物资潜力上，均占日本上风。”他们已认识了人民力量的强大。
    因此，就连日本相当一部分统治阶级也不得不看到，如果继续追随美帝，走武装日本与战争的道路，不但毫无胜利可能，而且一旦挑起大战，美国必更自顾不暇，那末就足致日本岛国的死命。那时，不仅钢铁工业的原料接济不上，就是吃饭问题也将发生严重恐慌。这种痛苦经验，是日本在第二次世界大战末期所体味过的。何况当时日本的条件远比现在优越。当时日本拥有三倍于目前的船舶，及可以任意掠夺的仅有一水之隔的广大占领区。所以上述日本旧法西斯陆军将领的备忘录，关于这一问题，给了这样的回答：“日本如果参加了范围广阔的远东冲突，只能对日本民族产生灾难的后果。”
    不过，今天日本，除了由美国及日本卖国政府所引导的、迫使日本民族走上战争与毁灭的道路以外，同时还存在着另外一条道路，这就是由中苏两国提出的、为日本广大人民所热烈支持的和平繁荣的新路——实行公正的全面的媾和，反对重新武装，与发展为日本人民所需要的和平工业。
    中日经济一向有着极密切的联系。一九三八年，日本输往我国台湾、东北、及关内各省的金额，占该年日本输出总额的百分之三十七点八。至一九三九年，又升至百分之五十一点一。拿日本的输入贸易来说，也是一样。一九三六年，日本所需铁矿石的百分之二十七、输入的三分之一，是从中国取得的。炼焦用粘结煤更完全依赖中国，一九三八年日本输入的煤（主要为炼焦用）有百分之八十三取自中国。同年，日本输入盐的百分之七十与大豆的百分之八十，全从中国取得。当然，过去日本经济对中国的依赖之深，是由于过去日本帝国主义对中国的血腥侵略所造成的。但自从日本帝国主义被击溃以后，如果日本决心走和平贸易的新路，那么中国人民，对于日本和平工业，还是愿意在平等互利的条件下，给予出路。
    同时，日本也只有离开对美国经济的依存，重新成为亚洲经济的组成部分，才能解决今天所存在的原料不足、运输困难、成本高昂等对于日本工业的致命威胁，也才能彻底摆脱长期来的经济危机，走上繁荣的道路。
    日本民族的两条道路——战争、毁灭的道路与和平、繁荣的道路，今天是如此明显地展开在日本全体人民之前，何去何从，决定着日本民族的死亡与再生。但是今天美国及其在日本的走卒——吉田政府，为了符合一小撮美国独占资本与日本买办资本的利益，正尽力把日本拖上战争的绝路。为了取得和平，取得繁荣，只有日本一切爱国人民，不分阶级、党派、信仰，共同团结起来，为粉碎美日反动派的片面对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋而斗争。
