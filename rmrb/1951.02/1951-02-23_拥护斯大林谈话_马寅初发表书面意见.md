　　Endorsing Stalin's Speech
　  Ma Yinchu Publishes Written Opinion
    [Our Newspaper] Non-Party Democrat Ma Yinchu published a written opinion on Marshal Stalin's speech on February 16th, stating: The imperialist bloc headed by the United States is expanding its military and preparing for war. However, they describe imperialism's own aggressive policies as "defensive" and slander our people's just action of resisting America and aiding Korea as "aggressive" actions. As Marshal Stalin said, this is simply a completely unconscionable act. This historical speech by this great international friend will have an extremely important effect on our country's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The Chinese people will certainly respond to the call of this great friend, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea with practical actions, and mobilize all forces to defend world peace.

　　拥护斯大林谈话
　  马寅初发表书面意见
    【本报讯】无党无派民主人士马寅初对斯大林大元帅二月十六日的谈话发表书面意见称：以美国为首的帝国主义集团正在扩充军备，准备战争。但他们把帝国主义自己的侵略政策说成是“防御”，诋毁我国人民抗美援朝的正义行动为“侵略”行动。这正如斯大林大元帅所说，简直是一种丧尽天良的行为。这位伟大国际友人的历史性的谈话，对于我国的抗美援朝保家卫国运动是会起极其重大的作用的。中国人民一定会响应这一伟大友人的号召，以实际行动来加强抗美援朝的工作，并动员一切力量来保卫世界和平。
