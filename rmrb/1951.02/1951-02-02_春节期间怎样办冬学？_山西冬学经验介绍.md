How to Run Winter School During the Spring Festival?
—Introduction to Shanxi's Winter School Experience

The Spring Festival is approaching, and at present, winter schools in various regions should pay special attention to the question of how to run winter schools during the Spring Festival. According to the experience of Shanxi Province over the years: "Winter schools are afraid of the New Year." Once it reaches the twelfth lunar month, the masses, especially women, are busy preparing for the New Year; in the first month, the masses will be engaged in Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities. This often reduces the number of students in winter schools, or even suspends them, and affects the work of winter schools transitioning to people's schools. However, if the leadership can pay attention in a timely manner, the problem can be better resolved. Last year, in Chuancun, Xiyang County, through summarizing learning and selecting models, winter schools were combined with Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities, allowing winter schools to smoothly transition into people's schools and expand enrollment.

"How winter schools should spend the New Year" is indeed a question worth noting. Therefore, I suggest: First, before the Spring Festival, all regions should organize a mass inspection, hold learning quizzes, achievement exhibitions, model awards, etc., to consolidate and increase the learning enthusiasm of the masses.

Second, the leadership should consciously lead the masses to formulate Spring Festival cultural and recreational plans, so that winter schools can be combined with Spring Festival cultural and recreational activities, and the content and achievements of winter schools, especially the patriotic education content of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the country, can be compiled into clappers, ditties, songs, dramas, etc., using various forms that the masses love to hear and see, repeatedly singing, and moving what they learn in winter schools to the streets, squares, and stages, making the educational content of winter schools more vivid and further expanding the educational results of winter schools.

Third, cultural learning classes in winter schools and people's schools should assign holiday homework during the holidays, strengthen self-study mutual aid groups and little teacher activities, and organize students to review their lessons under leadership. In particular, attention should be paid to organizing students to write and recognize couplets.

    春节期间怎样办冬学？
    —山西冬学经验介绍
    春节在即，目前各地冬学应该特别注意春节期间怎样办冬学的问题。根据山西省历年经验：“冬学怕过年”。一到腊月，广大群众特别是妇女群众，都要忙着准备过年的用品；正月里，群众又要闹春节文娱活动。这样，常使冬学人数减少，甚至停顿，并影响到冬学转民校的工作。但领导上如能及时注意，问题就可以获得较好的解决。去年昔阳县串村通过总结学习及评选模范，冬学与春节文娱活动结合，使冬学顺利地转入民校，并扩大了入学人数。
    “冬学如何过年”确实是值得注意的问题，因此，我建议：第一、在春节前，各地应组织一次群众性的检查，举行学习测验、成绩展览、模范奖励等，以此来巩固与增长群众的学习情绪。
    第二、领导上应有意识的领导群众订春节文娱计划，使冬学结合春节文娱，将冬学的内容和成绩特别是将抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义教育内容，编成快板、小调、歌曲、戏剧等，利用群众喜闻乐见的多种多样形式，反复演唱，把冬学里学的东西搬向街头、广场、戏台，使冬学教育内容形象化，进一步扩大冬学教育成果。
    第三、冬学民校中的文化学习班在放假期，应布置假期作业，加强自学互助小组和小先生活动，有领导的组织学员复习功课。特别是应该注意组织学员写对联和认对联。
