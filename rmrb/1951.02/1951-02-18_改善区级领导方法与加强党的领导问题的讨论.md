　　Discussion on Improving District-Level Leadership Methods and Strengthening Party Leadership
            (I)
　　Li Qing
    After reading Comrade Liu Qi, Secretary of the Lingqiu County Party Committee of the Chahar Province of the Communist Party of China, on his opinions on improving district-level leadership methods and strengthening Party leadership (published in the "Party Life" column on page three of the January 18th People's Daily), I have a few different opinions to put forward for discussion:
    What Comrade Liu Qi said about the shortage of cadres and the heavy workload is indeed the actual situation at the lower levels; however, these cadres are generally working actively and diligently, and are able to complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, which should be affirmed. The main problems existing among these cadres are low educational level, few working methods, insufficient familiarity with policies, and low theoretical level. Comrade Liu Qi also mentioned these issues in his opinion, but he advocates "not to sporadically transfer cadres for rotation training," which I think is inappropriate. Since the quality of cadres is low, we should find ways to improve it and strengthen education. The specific methods are: (1) Leaving the work position to study; (2) Short-term rotation training; (3) Strengthening study at the agency's spare-time school. The above three educational methods can fundamentally solve the problem of low cadre quality. Of course, it would be very good if cadres could study for one or two years at a time, but short-term rotation training can also solve some problems; this has been proven by many facts. For example, rural Party consolidation last winter was an arduous task. At the beginning, the cadres in our special district felt that they could not do it. After the short-term training by the district committee, the policy and political level of the cadres who participated in the study were improved. Forty cadres from Changping County who participated in the study generally had a clear understanding of the principles and methods of Party consolidation. For example, when Tongxian Special District carried out land reform last year, most of the cadres had received seven to fifteen days of training at the district committee's short-term training class, which enabled each cadre to understand the land reform policy and ensured the smooth completion of land reform. Isn't the benefit of short-term rotation training obvious? Last year's Party consolidation rotation training was during the autumn tax collection. Changping County sent forty cadres, leaving only the district party secretary in each district. However, the district committee, through leading the People's Congress and through the organizational system of various departments, still completed the autumn tax collection task on time. Can it still be said that cadre rotation training affected the work?
    Comrade Liu Qi also talked about the fact that due to the shortage of cadres, low quality, and heavy workload, coupled with the frequent submission of various statistical forms and work reports to the superiors, and the superiors' occasional transfer of cadres for rotation training, "a tendency has formed for the stronger district committee and other cadres to take care of everything." I believe that the above is not the main reason for the formation of the district committee and other cadres to take over everything; the main reason is that the district-level party committee system is not sound. The district level should strengthen the collective leadership of the party committee and division of responsibilities, and must not act independently or weaken departmental work. Comrade Liu Qi's proposal of "reducing departmental meetings and organizing collective office work for the Party, government, and people" is very inappropriate. This will not only fail to solve the problem of the Party substituting for the government, but will also more seriously promote the substitution of the Party for the government and weaken departmental work. This kind of "joint office" cannot improve the district-level leadership methods.
    So how exactly can we improve the district-level leadership methods? (1) Establish leadership of departmental work from top to bottom and strengthen departmental meetings to promote work. In addition to the secretary grasping the overall and central work, other members of the Party committee must do a good job in Party work, such as strengthening the Party's organizational life and Party propaganda and education. Through the exemplary actions of Party members, we can ensure the completion of central tasks and the development and consolidation of other departmental work. Only when the various departments are organized and mobilized can the central work be done well. (2) Strengthen the collective leadership method of the Party committee system. The Party committee should have both regular and temporary meetings. Issues related to the central work should be discussed and resolved through Party committee meetings, and implemented through the Party groups of various departments, and the Party committee should conduct timely inspections. District committee members should have clear divisions of labor and report their work to the district committee on time. Generally, work belonging to the department should be handled by the department, but the district committee should strengthen the leadership of departmental work and specifically help promote the plan. (3) Strengthen cadre education. The provincial and district committees should often run short-term rotation training classes, mainly to solve the problems of low cadre cultural level, few working methods, and unfamiliarity with policies. At the same time, without affecting the work too much, some cadres should be drawn out for a longer period of study. In addition, county and district levels must do a good job in spare-time schools; the district level mainly focuses on running mobile spare-time schools and regular study days. Party committees at all levels should regard strengthening cadre education as a political task. Only in this way can we improve the quality of cadres and lay a reliable foundation for long-term construction.
            (II)
    Wu Mingqing, Secretary of the Sixth District Committee of Puyang County, Pingyuan Province
    I have a few opinions on the issue of improving district-level leadership methods to offer for discussion:
    The situation of insufficient cadres, weak quality, and heavy workload in various places does exist. For example, our district has a total of 108 natural villages and more than 50,000 people; there are currently 24 cadres: 5 in Party affairs departments, 5 in mass organizations, and 14 in the government and armed forces department. Among these 24 cadres, 2 to 3 are often receiving training, and there are 5 or 6 vacancies due to sick personnel, maternity leave, and other absences; only 15 or 16 people regularly insist on working. Last spring, we felt helpless about this situation. After frequent guidance from the higher-level Party committee and learning from the experiences of various places, we have now explored a bit of a way out. The specific experience is:
    (1) Give play to the organizational role of various departments. After each central task is assigned, the district committee will formulate a district-wide plan, and each department will formulate a specific plan for its own department based on the district committee's plan. After approval by the district committee, it will be disseminated separately according to the system, and the district committee can assign specific help in the implementation. After the work begins, each department will report to the district committee according to the system, and the district committee will provide guidance at any time. In this way, when each task is assigned, there is an organizational guarantee for the work; each department also feels that there is leadership to take charge and help, and at the same time can complete the work of its own department, and everyone is happy. However, one problem must be solved in doing so, that is, to strengthen the village-level organizations, so that village political power, Party branches, Youth League branches, women's congresses, and armed committees, etc., are all sound.
    (2) Strengthen Party affairs work. Party affairs cadres should devote all their efforts to leading and educating rural Party members, and gradually improve the political consciousness of rural Party members so that they can play an exemplary role in various organizations. We didn't pay enough attention to this in the past, but it has now improved and we have also achieved success in our work.
    (3) The district committee should strengthen the leadership of the Party committee system, promote a democratic style, and enable each member to play a leading role.
    Furthermore, to improve district-level leadership methods, we must also prevent the tendency of acting independently. This tendency has already begun in our district. I think the solution to this problem should mainly be prevented by leadership, such as reducing some unnecessary forms and meetings in various departments, and the work requirements of various departments must fully comply with the Party committee's plan at that time. Department heads who are members of the Party committee should consider work more from an overall perspective.

### 改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导问题的讨论

　　改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导问题的讨论
            （一）
　　李清
    看到中共察哈尔省灵邱县委书记刘起同志对改善区级领导方法与加强党的领导的意见（登在一月十八日人民日报三版“党的生活栏”）后，我有几点不同的意见，提出来和大家讨论：
    刘起同志所说干部少、工作任务繁重，确是下面的实际情况；但是这些干部一般的都是积极工作、埋头苦干的，并能完成上级所给的任务，这是应该肯定的。这些干部中存在的主要问题是文化水平低、工作办法少、政策不够熟悉，理论不高。刘起同志意见中也谈到这些，但他却主张“不要零碎抽调干部轮训”，我认为这是不妥当的。因为既然是干部质量低，就应该设法使其提高，就应该加强教育，具体的办法就是：（一）脱离工作职位去学习；（二）短期轮训；（三）加强机关业余学校的学习。以上三种教育方法，可以从根本上解决干部质量低的问题。当然干部一下能去学一、二年是很好的，但是短期轮训也可以解决一些问题；这已为很多事实所证明，如去年冬天农村整党，本是个艰巨的任务，开始我们专区的干部都感到不会作。经过地委的短期训练，参加学习的干部的政策、政治水平都提高了一步。昌平县参加学习的四十名干部，一般的都明确地了解了整党的方针、目的与整党的方法。又如去年通县专区进行土地改革时，大部分干部都到地委短训班受过七天至十五天的训，使每个干部了解了土地改革政策，保证了土地改革顺利地完成。短期轮训的好处难道还不明显吗？去年整党轮训，正是秋征的时候，昌平县去了四十个干部，每区只剩下区委书记一人，但是区委通过领导人民代表会，通过各部门组织系统，秋征任务仍然按时完成了。这还能说干部轮训影响了工作吗？
    刘起同志又谈到由于干部少、质量低、工作多，加上经常给上级作各种统计表格工作报告和上级不时抽调干部轮训，“于是形成了由较强的区委等干部包办一切工作的倾向”。我认为以上所谈不是形成区委等干部包办代替的主要原因；而主要原因是区委党委制不健全。区级应该加强党委的集体领导与分工负责，决不能各自为政，也不能削弱部门工作。刘起同志所主张的“减少部门会议，组织党、政、民集体办公的方法”，是很不妥当的。这样不但解决不了以党代政的问题，而且会更严重的促成以党代政、削弱部门工作。这种“联合办公室”是改善不了区级领导方法的。
    那么究竟怎样改善区级领导方法呢？（一）由上而下确立部门工作的领导，加强部门会议推动工作。党委除书记掌握全面及中心工作外，其他各委员必须作好党的工作，如加强党的组织生活与党的宣传教育等等。通过党员模范行动，保证中心工作完成与其他部门工作的发展与巩固。只有各部门组织发动起来，中心工作才会搞好。（二）加强党委制的集体领导方法。党委要有定期与临时的两种会议。有关中心工作的问题，一律通过党委会议讨论，作出决议，通过各部门党组，保证执行，党委按时进行检查。区委委员应有明确分工，按时向区委会汇报工作。一般属于部门的工作，就由部门负责处理，但区委要加强部门工作领导，具体帮助推行计划。（三）加强干部教育工作。省、地委经常开办短期轮训班，主要解决干部文化水平低、工作办法少，政策不熟悉等问题。同时在不太影响工作情况下，抽出一部干部较长时间去学习。此外县、区级必须搞好业余学校；区级主要是搞好流动业余学校与定期学习日。各级党委应该把加强干部教育看成一个政治任务，只有这样才能提高干部质量，为长期建设打下可靠基础。
            （二）
    平原省濮阳县六区区委书记  吴明卿
    我对改善区级领导方法问题，有几点意见提出来供大家讨论：
    目前各地干部少、质量弱、工作任务繁重的情况，确实存在，如我区共有一百○八个自然村，五万余人口；现在共有干部二十四名：党务部门五名，群众团体五名，政府及武装部十四名。在这二十四名干部中，经常有二至三人去受训，有病号、产妇休养及其他缺额等五、六人；经常坚持工作的，也不过十五、六个人。去年春天，我们对这种情况感觉很没办法，经过上级党委经常的指导与学习了各地的经验，现在已经多少摸索出一点门路，具体的经验是：
    （一）发挥各部门的组织作用。每件中心工作布置下来后，区委会即作出全区计划，各部门根据区委计划作出本部门具体计划，经区委会批准，即分头按系统贯彻下去，区委可分工具体帮助贯彻。工作开始进行后，各部门按制度向区委作汇报，区委随时进行指导。这样每一个工作布置下去时，工作进行既有了组织保证；各部门也感觉有了领导上作主与帮助，同时又能完成本部门工作，大家都愉快。但这样作必须解决一个问题，就是加强村级组织，使村政权、党支、团支、妇代会及武委会等等部门都健全起来。
    （二）要加强党务工作。党务干部应将全力放到领导与教育农村党员上面，逐步提高农村党员的政治觉悟，使其在各个组织里，能起模范作用。这一点我们过去注意不够，现已有好转，工作中亦有成绩。
    （三）区委会加强党委制领导，发扬民主作风，使每个委员都能发挥领导作用。
    再者改善区级领导方法，还要防止各自为政的偏向发生。我区现已开始有这种偏向。这个问题的解决，我认为主要应从领导上注意防止，如各部门一些不必要的表格及会议应减少，各部门的工作要求，要完全符合党委当时的计划。部门负责人如系党委，应多从整体方面考虑工作。
