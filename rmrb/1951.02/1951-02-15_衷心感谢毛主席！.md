    Sincere Thanks to Chairman Mao!

    I am a revolutionary soldier's family member, formerly working at the Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau. My son is currently working in the Garrison Headquarters. I fell ill last March and have only recently recovered. During my illness, the care I received from the government and the army moved me deeply.

    On April 2nd last year, I was hospitalized in the Third Hospital due to a stomach ulcer. That day, I vomited and had diarrhea with blood, and my condition was serious. The only way to save me was through a large blood transfusion. My blood type is O, different from my family's, and I didn't have money to buy blood. The situation was very dangerous, and my family was worried sick. As it was getting dark, a young female comrade, about seventeen or eighteen years old, came in and volunteered to donate 100 cc of blood. As she took off her clothes to draw blood, I was so moved that I almost burst into tears; but she comforted me instead. Afterwards, I learned that this female comrade was named Kang Zhiqing, a student in the hospital's nursing training class. I didn't thank her while I was sick; but I will never forget her.

    Soon after, I vomited blood again and needed more transfusions. When the comrades from the Garrison Headquarters learned about this, more than a dozen comrades came the next day. After blood type testing, four comrades donated blood to me. Comrade Li Suídāng, a cook in the army, who was over forty years old, also volunteered to donate blood. When I thanked him, he said, "This is nothing! If I were sick, the family members of the comrades would take care of me just as my family is being taken care of. This is commonplace in the People's Liberation Army." After donating blood, to save me money, he even refused to take a pedicab and walked back himself.

    My illness gradually improved, and I was discharged from the hospital in June. But in September, I suffered from "pyloric stenosis" again and was treated at the Third Hospital. In November, I needed surgery. Because I was anemic, I needed a blood transfusion of 1200 cc before the surgery. Because I am a revolutionary soldier's family member, the responsible comrade in the hospital helped me resolve 800 cc of blood and waived all medical and food expenses. In addition to providing me with financial assistance, Comrade Li Suídāng from the army came to the hospital again to donate 100 cc of blood. After the surgery, my health gradually recovered.

    Because I was sick for a long time, my family's life was difficult. After the district government learned about this, they gave me relief grain every month. During this year's Spring Festival, the district government also distributed meat, movie tickets, and so on, and even came to my house to pay New Year's greetings with gongs and drums.

    These facts have deeply moved me, making me feel the glory of being a revolutionary soldier's family member.

    This is what Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have brought us. I sincerely thank Chairman Mao and thank the Communist Party!

    衷心感谢毛主席！
    我是一个革命军人家属，原在北京市税务局工作。我的儿子现在纠察总队工作。去年三月，我病了，直到现在才好。在我病中，政府、部队对我的照顾，使我非常感动。
    去年四月二日，我因患胃溃疡住在第三医院。那天我吐血、泻血太多，病势严重，唯一治救办法是大量输血。我的血是Ｏ型，与家里人的血都不同，而又没有钱买血。情形很危险，家里人都替我发愁。天快黑时，走进一位十七、八岁的女同志，自愿给我输一百Ｃ·Ｃ·血。当她脱下衣服抽血时，重病中的我感动得几乎掉下泪来；但她反而安慰我。事后，我知道这位女同志叫康志清，是医院护士训练班的学生。我在病中，没有向她道谢；但是我永远不会忘掉她。
    不久，我又吐了血，需要继续输血。纠察总队的同志们知道这个情况后，第二天就来了十几位同志。经过检查血型，有四个同志给我输了血。部队中炊事员李随堂同志，他已经四十多岁了，还自动要求给我输血。当我向他道谢时，他说：“这算不了什么！如果我有了病，同志们的家属也会和我的家属一样照顾我。在人民解放军中这是平常事。”他输血后，为了使我少花钱，连三轮车都拒绝坐，自己走着回去。
    我的病渐渐好了，六月里，我出了院。但到九月，我又犯了“幽门狭窄”病，入第三医院治疗。十一月份，我需要动手术。因为我贫血，动手术前须输血一千二百Ｃ·Ｃ·。因为我是革命军人家属，医院负责同志代我解决了八百Ｃ·Ｃ·血，并将全部医药饭费免掉。部队上除在经济上给我照顾外，李随堂同志又到医院来输了一百Ｃ·Ｃ·血。我动了手术后，健康逐渐恢复。
    病的时间很久，家中生活很困难。区政府知道这个情况后，每月都发给我救济粮。在今年春节，区政府又发肉、发电影票等，还打着锣鼓来我家拜年。
    这些事实，深深感动了我，使我感到作为一个革命军人家属的光荣。
    这是毛主席、共产党带给我们的。我衷心感谢毛主席，感谢共产党！
