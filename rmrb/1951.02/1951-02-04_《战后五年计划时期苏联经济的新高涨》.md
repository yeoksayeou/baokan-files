    Authored by Su. Gurevich and Batigul, translated by Zhang Tingzheng and others. 32mo, 124 pages, base price 6.20 yuan. Published by Tianxia Publishing House in early October 1950.
    "The New Upsurge in Soviet Economy During the Post-War Five-Year Plan" systematically reports on the construction of the Soviet Union's post-war Five-Year Plan. Horizontally, it includes all aspects of the Soviet Union's post-war industry, transportation, agriculture, and the material and cultural life of the people. Vertically, it runs through the development of the post-war New Five-Year Plan from 1946 to 1950. In terms of narration, it also constantly presents comparisons with capitalist countries, using ironclad facts to prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist economic system.
    What capitalist countries consider dreams and impossibilities are being realized step by step in socialist countries. Human miracles are constantly appearing thanks to the creative efforts of socialism. As early as when Lenin proposed the national electrification plan, the famous British writer Wells called Lenin a dreamer. But fifteen years later, electrification was not only realized, but also greatly exceeded the original plan. So later, Stalin told Wells: "If you do not liberate yourselves from the hands of the capitalists, if you do not abolish the principle of private ownership of the means of production, you cannot create a planned economy." This is the secret of all miracles.
    During World War II, the destruction inflicted on the Soviet Union by the German fascist bandits was very heavy. When destroying, the German bandits even assured Hitler: "Russia will need twenty-five years to recover from the destruction we have done." This is not only the wish of the fascist German bandits, but also the common wish of all warmongers. But what are the facts? In the fourth quarter of 1947, the average quarterly level of industrial production had already reached the pre-war level of 1940. In 1948, the total output of the entire industry exceeded the 1940 level by 18 percent. Bourgeois economists have constantly expressed doubts about the feasibility of the New Five-Year Plan. But the fact is that it was not only realized, but also realized ahead of schedule.
    Socialist countries have no secrets that are not passed on, and no narrow-minded ideas of monopolizing the methods of creating miracles. This book provides very detailed explanations of the reasons and methods for the continuous economic upsurge everywhere, and cites typical facts. For example, how "highly productive work groups" have improved labor productivity, what methods workers have used to exert creative wisdom with the support and encouragement of the Party, and what methods have been used to reduce costs and improve quality. This really has a lot of nutrition that can be drawn on for our economic construction. (Huang Biyun)

　　《战后五年计划时期苏联经济的新高涨》
    苏·顾雷维奇、巴梯古尔合著 张廷铮等译 三十二开本 一二四页基价六元二角  天下出版社一九五○年十月初版
    《战后五年计划时期苏联经济的新高涨》系统地报道了苏联战后五年计划的建设情形：横的方面，包括了苏联战后的工业、运输、农业、人民物质生活文化生活的各面；纵的方面，贯串了自一九四六年到一九五○年战后新五年计划的发展。就叙述方面看，还随时提出与资本主义国家的对照，拿铁一般的事实证明了社会主义经济制度的无比优越性。
    在资本主义国家认为是梦想、不可能的事，在社会主义国家却着着实现。人类的奇迹，凭了社会主义创造性的努力，在不断的出现。早在列宁提出全国电气化计划的时候，英国的著名作家威尔士就称列宁是梦想家了。但十五年后，电气化不仅实现了，而且大大地超过了原来的计划。所以后来斯大林告诉威尔士：“如果你们不从资本家的手中解放你们自己，如果你们不废除生产手段私有制的原则，你们是不能创造一种计划经济的”。这就是一切奇迹的秘密所在。
    二次大战中，德国法西斯强盗所加于苏联的破坏，是十分沉重的。德国的强盗在破坏时甚至向希特勒保证：“对于我们所作的破坏，俄国需要二十五年的时间才能恢复”。这不仅是法西斯德国强盗的愿望，也是一切战争贩子所同具的愿望。但事实怎样？在一九四七年第四季，工业生产的每季平均水准，已经达到了战前一九四○年的水准。一九四八年，整个工业的生产总量已经超过一九四○年水准的百分之十八。资产阶级的经济学家，都曾对新五年计划的实现可能性，不断表示怀疑。而事实是不但实现了，并且提前实现了。
    社会主义国家没有不传之秘，没有独占出现奇迹方法的狭隘思想。本书对经济不断高涨的原因与方法，随处都有很详尽的说明，并且举出了典型的事实。譬如说“高度生产工作组”怎样提高了劳动生产力，工人是用什么方法在党的支持与鼓励下发挥了创造性的智慧，用什么方法减低了成本、提高了品质。这对于我们的经济建设，实在有不少可以汲取的养分。（黄碧云）
