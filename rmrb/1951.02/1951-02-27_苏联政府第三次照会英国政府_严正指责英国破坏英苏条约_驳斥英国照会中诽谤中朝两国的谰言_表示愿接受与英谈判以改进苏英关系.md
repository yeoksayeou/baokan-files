The Soviet Government's Third Note to the British Government

Sternly Accuses Britain of Undermining the Anglo-Soviet Treaty

Refutes the Slanders Against China and North Korea in the British Note

Expresses its Willingness to Accept Negotiations with Britain to Improve Anglo-Soviet Relations

(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th) The Soviet government sent its third note to the British government on February 24th, accusing the British government of undermining the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and refuting various absurd remarks made by the British government in its reply of February 17th to the Soviet government's note of January 20th.

According to TASS, Moscow, February 25th: The Soviet government's note of February 24th began by stating: In its second reply, the British government adopted methods of fabrication and slander, attempting to portray the British government's aggressive policy as a policy of peace and the Soviet Union's policy of peace as a policy of aggression. However, facts prove that Britain has violated the treaty, committed the crime of pursuing an aggressive policy and a policy of launching war, and failed to implement a policy of maintaining peace.

The note accuses the British government of embarking on the path of undermining cooperation and the treaty since 1946, stating: The British government merged the British and American occupation zones in Germany, resulting in the division of Germany into two parts, the issuance of a special currency in West Germany, and the establishment of the West German Bonn government. All these measures were implemented unilaterally without Soviet participation. The British government also violated the Anglo-Soviet treaty, which stipulated that both parties should take all measures to prevent Germany from engaging in aggression and undermining peace, as well as the Yalta and Potsdam conferences' provisions on eradicating German militarism and democratizing Germany, by restoring the power of Krupp and his partners in the Ruhr region; reinstating Hitler's generals to important positions; suppressing democratic and peace-loving people in West Germany; turning the Ruhr into a base for war industry; and beginning to re-establish regular German troops led by Nazi generals.

The note points out: The British government has also violated Article 7 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, which stipulates that "both contracting parties undertake not to conclude or participate in any alliance or coalition directed against the other contracting party," openly defying the obligations Britain should bear under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. Together with the French government, it initiated the establishment of the so-called "Western European Union"; subsequently, it established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the United States. Facts prove that they are all aimed directly against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The note states: Britain is also embarking on the path of forming a direct military alliance with the revanchist government of West Germany, thereby grossly trampling on the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.

The note sternly refutes the malicious slanders in the British note regarding the internal situations of the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, and also refutes the slanders in the British note that defame the Korean people and the People's Republic of China as aggressors. The note states: China and Korea, who are defending their national interests and territories, are not aggressors. The aggressors are the United States and Britain, who have sent troops from their own countries to the territory of Korea, thousands of kilometers away. The note states: The Soviet government believes that the British note's accusation that the Soviet government's sympathy for the liberation struggles of the people of Malaya, Vietnam, and other oppressed countries violates the Anglo-Soviet Treaty is frivolous and absurd. No clause in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty prohibits anyone from expressing sympathy for the liberation movements of any country. As long as imperialist oppression exists, the liberation movements of oppressed nations will inevitably exist. Accusing the Soviet government of this is as absurd as accusing the Soviet government of causing earthquakes or tides in the world.

The note relentlessly exposes and mocks the British reply's absurd claim that the failure of the Marshall Plan, the loss of prestige of the United Nations, and even "strikes and social unrest" in Britain should all be blamed on the Soviet Union.

The note firmly refutes the British note's claim that the Soviet government has only demobilized a portion of its wartime maximum military personnel, stating: In fact, the Soviet government has basically and extensively demobilized its troops, completing the demobilization of thirty-three age groups. No country needs large-scale demobilization more than the Soviet Union, because without millions of demobilized personnel returning to farms and factories, the Soviet Union would not have the strength to organize its post-war economic progress and restore the regions, towns, railways, industries, and agriculture destroyed by the German occupiers. Only those who intend to discredit the Soviet Union can deny these facts. The British note also states that the current Soviet army exceeds the total number of troops of all Western European countries. However, the current number of Soviet armed forces, including the army, navy, and air force, is equivalent to the number of Soviet armed forces before the outbreak of World War II (i.e., 1939). The current number of armed forces of the United States, Britain, and France, including the army, air force, and navy, exceeds five million, and is continuing to increase rapidly, surpassing the number of troops owned by the three countries in 1939 before World War II several times over, and exceeding the number of existing Soviet armed forces by more than double. Therefore, the British note is a misleading slander aimed at deceiving public opinion, thereby finding an excuse for Britain's arms expansion movement. The United States, Britain, and France are not preparing for defense, but for aggression, preparing to launch a new world war.

The note points out that among the British people and the Soviet people, there exists goodwill, friendship, and gratitude towards each other. However, the Soviet government does not believe that the British note's claim that the British government seems to have consistently sought cooperation with the Soviet Union is well-founded. As early as 1944, the Labour Party conference passed a resolution stipulating that those who participate in the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association should not participate in the Labour Party; in recent years, Labour Party leaders and Conservative Party leaders have directed a vicious anti-Soviet smear campaign, constantly encouraging and inciting this movement through artificial methods.

The note states: The British government is no longer concerned with consolidating international peace; it has now linked its fate with the reckless arms expansion movement and the reckless new war propaganda. The Soviet government is clearly different from the British government, and it still adheres to its peace-loving stance. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government believes that faithful adherence to the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and strict adherence to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements on the German issue are extremely important, especially when violations of these agreements seriously harm the cause of maintaining peace.

The note concludes: In its note, the British government expressed its willingness to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union in the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty to seek a long-term improvement in relations between the two countries. Due to the aforementioned reasons, the Soviet government cannot have full confidence in the British government's statement. However, the Soviet government is still willing to participate in such negotiations in an effort to seize every opportunity to improve relations with Britain. The Soviet government will attach great importance to any genuine steps taken by the British government aimed at improving relations with the Soviet Union.

### 苏联政府第三次照会英国政府  严正指责英国破坏英苏条约  驳斥英国照会中诽谤中朝两国的谰言　表示愿接受与英谈判以改进苏英关系

　　苏联政府第三次照会英国政府
　  严正指责英国破坏英苏条约
    驳斥英国照会中诽谤中朝两国的谰言
　　表示愿接受与英谈判以改进苏英关系
    【新华社二十六日讯】苏联政府于二月二十四日第三次照会英国政府，指责英国政府破坏英苏合作互助条约，并对英国政府在二月十七日答复苏联政府一月二十日照会的复文中所提出各项荒谬言论加以驳斥。
    据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：苏联政府二月二十四日的照会首称：英国政府在其二次复文中，采取捏造和诽谤的办法，想把英国政府的侵略政策说成和平政策，而把苏联的和平政策说成侵略政策。然而，事实证明，英国违反了条约，犯了实行侵略政策、实行发动战争政策而并不实行维护和平政策的罪行。
    照会指责英国政府自一九四六年起便走上破坏合作与破坏条约的道路称：英国政府合并了英、美两国在德国的占领区，结果使德国分裂为两部分，在西德发行特别的货币和成立了西德的波恩政府，所有这些措施，都是以片面的行动，在没有苏联参加的情况下实行的。英国政府并违反英苏条约关于双方应采取一切措施使德国不能再从事侵略和破坏和平及雅尔塔与波茨坦会议关于肃清德国军国主义及使德国民主化的规定，而实行恢复克虏伯及其伙伴在鲁尔区的权力；使希特勒将领重任要职；镇压西德民主的和爱好和平的人士；把鲁尔变为战争工业的基地；并开始重新建立由纳粹将领率领的德国正规军队。
    照会指出：英国政府并且违反了英苏条约第七条关于“缔约国双方保证不缔结也不参加旨在反对缔约国另一方的任何同盟或联合”的规定，公开地蔑视英国根据英苏条约所应承担的义务，与法国政府共同倡议建立所谓“西欧联盟”；此后，又与美国建立了北大西洋国家集团。事实证明：它们都是以直接反对苏联及人民民主国家为目的的。照会称：英国并且正在走上与西德的复仇主义的政府结成直接的军事同盟的道路，从而粗暴地蹂躏了英苏条约。
    照会严正地驳斥了英国照会中对于苏联及各国人民民主国家内部情况的恶意诽谤，也驳斥了英国照会中诽谤朝鲜人民和中华人民共和国为侵略者的谰言。照会称：保卫自己国家利益和国土的中国和朝鲜并不是侵略者，侵略者是美国和英国，他们从国内派军队到几千公里外的朝鲜领土上去。照会称：苏联政府认为英国照会中指责苏联政府对马来亚和越南及其他被压迫各国人民的解放斗争表示同情是违反英苏条约是不郑重而且荒谬的。英苏条约并没有一款禁止任何人对任何国家的解放运动表示同情。只要帝国主义压迫存在一天，那么，被压迫民族的解放运动也就必然存在，以此来指责苏联政府正如以世界上发生地震或潮汐为理由来指责苏联政府一样荒诞不经。
    照会对于英国复文中认为马歇尔计划之失败、联合国威信之丧失、甚至英国国内发生“罢工和社会骚乱”等等都应诿过于苏联的胡说，予以无情的揭发和嘲笑。
    照会坚决驳斥英国照会中所说苏联政府只复员了战时最大限度的军役人员中的一部分的说法称：事实上，苏联政府已把它的军队基本上而且大规模地复员了，它已将三十三级役龄人员复员完毕。没有任何国家比苏联更需要大规模的复员，因为如果没有几百万复员人员回到农场和工厂，苏联便不会有力量组织其战后的经济进展和恢复被德国占领者破毁的地区、市镇、铁道、工业和农业。只有那些意图诋毁苏联的人，才能够否认这些事实。英国的照会又说，目前的苏联军队，在数量上超过全体西欧国家军队的总和。但是，目前苏联武装部队的人数，陆、海、空三军合计，与二次世界大战爆发以前（即一九三九年）苏联武装部队的人数相等。而美、英、法三国目前武装部队陆、空、海军便达五百万人以上，并正在继续迅速增加，其人数比第二次世界大战以前的一九三九年三国所拥有的人数超过数倍，而且比苏联现有武装部队的人数多一倍以上。因此，英国照会的说法乃是一种混淆视听的诽谤，其目的在于蛊惑舆论，从而为英国的扩张军备运动找寻借口。英、美、法三国不是在准备防御，乃是在准备侵略，准备发动新的世界大战。
    照会指出，在英国人民与苏联人民中间，存在着对于彼此的善意、友谊和感激。但是，苏联政府不认为英国照会中所称英国政府似乎也曾坚决不渝地谋求与苏联合作一节是有根据的。远在一九四四年，工党会议便通过决议，规定凡参加英苏友好协会者不得参加工党；最近几年，工党领袖又和保守党领袖指挥着凶恶的反对苏联的诽谤运动，用人为的方法经常对这一运动予以怂恿和煽动。
    照会称：英国政府已不再关心巩固国际间的和平，它现在已把它的命运与肆无忌惮的军备扩张运动及胡作非为的新战争宣传联结起来了。苏联政府显然与英国政府不同，它仍然坚持它爱好和平的立场。正是为了这个原因，苏联政府认为忠实遵行英苏条约以及严格遵行关于德国问题的雅尔塔与波茨坦协定至为重要，尤其是在违反这些协定的行为严重损害了维护和平的事业的时候。
    照会结语称：英国政府在其照会中，表示愿按照英苏条约的精神与苏联进行谈判，以求长期改善两国的关系。由于上述诸端，苏联政府对英国政府的声明不能具有充分信心。但苏联政府仍愿意参加这种谈判，以力求利用一切机会改进与英国的关系。苏联政府将十分重视英国政府任何真正旨在改进与苏联的关系的步骤。
