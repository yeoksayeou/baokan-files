Revolutionary Soldier's Family Member Wang Yulan
Reports to Commander-in-Chief Zhu on Being Elected a Model Worker

Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

I am a revolutionary soldier's family member from Hala Wusu Village, Zhangbei County, Chahar Province. My husband has been in the People's Liberation Army for three years, and there are only my elderly parents and myself at home. I know that labor is the most glorious thing. If we women do not engage in labor production, we cannot independently maintain our lives and cannot achieve true and thorough liberation. Therefore, I work hard on both field work and housework. As a result, I was elected as a labor model in Zhangbei County and participated in this year's Chahar Province Labor Model Conference, where I was warmly welcomed by the masses and cordially received by leaders at all levels. I feel very honored. I know: This honor was given to me by the people, brought to us by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

After returning to the village, I conveyed to the people of our village the government's production policies, the production experiences of labor models from all over the province, and the effectiveness of new farming methods. Now our village has decided to organize women to participate in production and prepare the foundation for this year's production; we will also mobilize women to participate in literacy classes in people's schools. I am illiterate. When I went to the provincial conference this time, I couldn't read the newspaper or take notes. I deeply experienced the suffering of being illiterate!

Last year, under the leadership of the government, my family survived the summer drought, and the autumn harvest was very good. The family's life is much better than before. The government gave me preferential grain in a timely manner. During the busy farming season, the village also helped me with labor. During the New Year holidays, the villagers also came to comfort us. I really feel the supreme glory of being a military family member. I will work harder in production in the future to ensure that I don’t need the villagers to help with a single day of labor. I will definitely write to my husband often to encourage him to work hard, learn more combat skills, and strive to defend our great motherland.

Respectfully wishing you

Good health

　　革命军人家属王玉兰
    向朱总司令报告当选劳动模范
    朱总司令：
    我是察哈尔张北县哈拉无素村的一个革命军人家属。我丈夫参加人民解放军已经三年了，家里只有年老的父母和我三人。我知道劳动是最光荣的，我们妇女要不劳动生产，不能独立维持生活，就不能得到真正彻底的解放。因此，不论地里的活和家里的活，我都拚命的做。这样，我就被选为张北县劳动模范，参加了今年的察哈尔省劳动模范大会，受到了群众热烈的欢迎和各级首长热情的招待。我觉得非常光荣。我知道：这光荣是人民给我的，是毛主席、朱总司令带给我们的。
    我回村后，就向本村人民传达了人民政府的生产政策、全省各地劳动模范们的生产经验及新耕作方法的效果。现在我们村里已决定组织妇女参加生产，准备好今年生产的基础；还要发动妇女参加民校识字班学习。我不识字，这次到省里开会时，不会看报，也不会记笔记，我深深地体验到了不识字的苦处！
    去年在政府领导下，我家度过了夏季灾荒，秋天收成还很好。家里生活比过去好得多了。政府及时地给我优待粮。农忙时，村里还帮我工。过年节时，老乡还来慰问我们。我真感觉到军属无尚的光荣。我以后更要努力生产，保证不用老乡帮一个工。我一定常常给我丈夫去信，鼓励他好好工作，多学习战斗的本领，为保卫我们伟大的祖国而奋斗。
        敬祝您
    身体健康
