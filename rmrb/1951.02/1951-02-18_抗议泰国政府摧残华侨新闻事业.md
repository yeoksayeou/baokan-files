Protesting the Thai Government's Destruction of Overseas Chinese News Media

On January 31st, the reactionary Luang Phibuns government of Thailand unreasonably arrested Cai Zhihong, the editor-in-chief, and Wu Jianzhong, the publisher, of the *Quan Min Bao* (全民报), a Chinese newspaper published in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. The Thai Ministry of Interior also threatened to deport Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong. This incident is yet another crime committed by the reactionary and dictatorial Luang Phibuns government of Thailand in persecuting Overseas Chinese by Fascist means. This illegal measure by the Thai reactionary government has aroused resolute opposition from the Overseas Chinese in Thailand. The Chinese people cannot tolerate this reactionary atrocity of the Thai government in destroying the patriotic Overseas Chinese news media.

Our Overseas Chinese compatriots in Thailand have suffered all kinds of persecution and humiliation from imperialists and Thai reactionaries over the years. The Thai reactionary authorities have continuously carried out illegal searches, arrests, and unreasonable deportations of Overseas Chinese, arbitrarily sealed up Overseas Chinese schools and restricted the establishment of Chinese language courses, created difficulties for Overseas Chinese youth returning to their country to study, persecuted and closed Overseas Chinese-published newspapers and periodicals, and destroyed Overseas Chinese industry and commerce. Under Luang Phibuns' anti-Chinese tyranny, Overseas Chinese in Thailand have been deprived of freedom of business, residence, education, and speech.

The Thai reactionary government's consistent Fascist crimes of persecuting Overseas Chinese have aroused the anger of the entire Chinese people. Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, lodged a serious protest with the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 26th of last year regarding the Thai government's abuse and killing of Overseas Chinese. Our country's democratic parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life in various places have also issued statements one after another, supporting Deputy Minister Li's protest, resolutely opposing the Thai government's anti-Chinese atrocities, and warning the Thai government that it must respect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese and not be allowed to carry out persecution again.

The Thai reactionary government's continuous persecution of Overseas Chinese demonstrates its hostile attitude towards New China. In October 1949, Overseas Chinese in Thailand excitedly celebrated the founding of our Central People's Government, but were unreasonably prohibited by the Thai police authorities, and nearly a thousand Overseas Chinese were arrested. Last October, the Thai government illegally oppressed Overseas Chinese, forbidding them from hanging national flags and prohibiting them from celebrating National Day. After the Thai reactionary government signed the "Thai-US Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" and the "Thai-US Military Assistance Agreement" with US imperialism in September and October of last year, under the instructions of US imperialism, its reactionary measures of persecuting Overseas Chinese and being hostile to New China have intensified. The criminal motive of the Thai reactionaries in persecuting *Quan Min Bao* is to attempt to block news from the motherland among Overseas Chinese, to deceive Overseas Chinese in Thailand, and to stop the progressive speech of Overseas Chinese, in preparation for their further conspiracy to persecute Overseas Chinese. According to news from Bangkok, Thai reactionary members of parliament proposed the so-called "Restricted Area Regulations" in the lower house last December, conspiring to squeeze out Overseas Chinese in the eighteen provinces where Overseas Chinese are concentrated and the area is prosperous, and order them to move out within a time limit. This is one example of this conspiracy.

The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the Thai government's crimes of illegally persecuting Overseas Chinese. We strongly protest against all the unreasonable persecution of Overseas Chinese by the Thai government. We warn the Thai government that it must respect all the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese in Thailand, and must immediately release Cai Zhihong and Wu Jianzhong, the heads of *Quan Min Bao* who were unreasonably arrested. The Thai government must immediately stop its actions and conspiracies to persecute Overseas Chinese and be hostile to New China, otherwise it must bear full responsibility for all its reactionary crimes.

### 抗议泰国政府摧残华侨新闻事业

　　抗议泰国政府摧残华侨新闻事业
    泰国銮披汶反动政府，于一月三十一日无理逮捕了在泰国首都曼谷出版的华侨报纸《全民报》的总编辑蔡志宏及该报出版人吴建中，泰国内政部并扬言要将蔡志宏和吴建中驱逐出境。这个事件，是銮披汶反动独裁政府一贯以法西斯手段迫害华侨的又一罪行。泰国反动政府这一非法措施，已激起在泰侨胞的坚决反对。中国人民对于泰国政府的这一摧残爱国侨胞新闻事业的反动暴行，是不能容忍的。
    我国旅泰侨胞，历年来受到帝国主义与泰国反动派的种种迫害和凌辱。泰国反动当局对华侨不断施行非法搜查、逮捕及无理驱逐出境，并恣意查封华侨学校及限制设中文课程，刁难华侨青年返国就学，迫害和封闭华侨出版的报纸刊物及摧残华侨工商业。旅泰侨胞在銮披汶的排华暴政之下，已被剥夺了营业、居住、教育、言论等自由。
    泰国反动政府的一贯迫害华侨的法西斯罪行，引起了全中国人民的愤怒。我国中央人民政府外交部副部长李克农曾于去年一月二十六日就泰国政府虐待和杀害华侨问题向泰国外交部提出严重抗议。我国各民主党派、团体及各地各界人民亦纷纷发表声明，拥护李副部长的抗议，坚决反对泰国政府的排华暴行，并警告泰国政府必须尊重华侨的正当权益，不容许再施迫害。
    泰国反动政府的对华侨的不断迫害，表示了它对于新中国的敌视态度。一九四九年十月，旅泰华侨兴奋地庆祝我中央人民政府成立，竟遭到泰国警察当局的无理禁止，近千名的华侨被逮捕。去年十月泰国政府又非法压迫华侨不准悬挂国旗，禁止庆祝国庆。泰国反动政府自去年九月和十月与美帝国主义签订了“泰美经济技术援助协定”和“泰美军事援助协定”以后，在美帝国主义的指使下，迫害华侨，敌视新中国的反动措施，日益加剧。泰国反动派迫害全民报的罪恶动机，是企图在华侨中封锁祖国消息，以蒙蔽在泰华侨，并且制止华侨的进步言论，以准备其进一步迫害华侨的阴谋。据曼谷消息说：泰国反动议员曾于去年十二月在下院提出所谓“禁区条例”，阴谋在华侨集中，地方繁华的十八府的范围内排挤华侨，勒令他们限期迁出。这就是这种阴谋的一个例子。
    中国人民绝对不能容忍泰国政府非法迫害华侨的罪行。我们严重地抗议泰国政府对华侨的一切无理迫害行为。我们警告泰国政府，必须尊重在泰华侨的一切正当权益，必须立即释放被无理逮捕的全民报的负责人蔡志宏及吴建中。泰国政府必须立即停止其迫害华侨和敌视新中国的行动和阴谋，否则必须对它的一切反动罪行负全部责任。
