　　The Life of Farmers in the Mountainous Areas of Western Guangdong
    Zhang Sheng
    The western Guangdong and Suijiang River areas are quite rich in local products and mountain goods. For example, in the area from Guangning to Huaiji in Guangxi, fir and pine trees and bamboo forests fill the mountains and valleys. Cinnamon, rosin, catechu gambir, and fragrant powder near Lubu Market in western Guangdong are also major local products. These places have more mountains than fields, and the purchase and sale of local products are directly or indirectly related to the lives of the people.
    Lubu Market in Gaoyao, western Guangdong, is an important market for the distribution of mountain goods and local products in western Guangdong. Many mountain villages surrounding it, such as Lüzhen, Ludong, Pingnan, Zhongduan, and Xikang townships, rely on mountain goods and local products such as rosin, cinnamon, and catechu gambir for their livelihoods, accounting for more than 30% of the local population. For example, in Niupi Mountain Village in Lüzhen Township, those who rely on cinnamon for a living account for 80% of the village population; in Kengwei Village, those who rely on cinnamon and other mountain goods for a living account for 95% of the village population. The well-being of the people in these mountain villages directly and indirectly affects the prosperity of Lubu Market. Since the Guangdong Provincial Native Produce Company began purchasing local products from various places after liberation, the lives of the mountain farmers in western Guangdong have been greatly improved, and Lubu Market has embarked on a path of prosperity.
    From April to October 1950, the quantity of mountain goods exported from Lubu Market was: cinnamon, rosin, fragrant powder, turpentine, etc., with a total value of 36.67 billion yuan. This income has played a significant role in promoting the rural economy. Due to the general increase in the purchasing power of mountain farmers in the surrounding townships, many new stores were added to Lubu Market in 1950. According to statistics, grocery stores increased by twelve, including Xinxin, etc., cloth stores increased by five, including Peng Jinyuan, etc., and rice stores increased by four, including Wanxin, etc. The prosperity can also be seen from the monthly sales figures of each store. For example, Jianxin Store's purchases in July 1950 were 54.29 million yuan, an increase of 91% compared to May. De Xing Cloth Store's purchases in July were 24.27 million yuan, an increase of 70% compared to May. At the same time, the lives of mountain farmers in the first district of Gaoyao have also greatly improved, and they have the surplus to make clothes. For example, in the Shuinan Market in the first district, six tailoring shops have been added; in Zhongduan Township, four tailoring shops have also been added. According to a cadre of the seventh village cooperative in Zhongduan Township, in recent months, the seventh village cooperative has purchased more than 20 bolts of local cloth on behalf of farmers (each bolt varies in length, some are 20 zhang long, and some are 5 zhang long). The population of the seventh village is about 800 people, and it is estimated that each person can purchase an average of 1 zhang of cloth by the end of the year.
    Aozai in Huaiji is a distribution center for Lizhu bamboo, a special export product of South China. Here, 13% of the county's population relies on Lizhu bamboo for a living. According to general estimates, the total area of Huaiji is 8,628 square li, and the area producing bamboo accounts for nearly one-seventh of the county's area. During the Anti-Japanese War, mountain farmers suffered severe famine and disaster because the sales channels for Lizhu bamboo were cut off. Since the Guangdong Provincial Native Produce Company and private merchants organized a joint venture to unify the purchase and sale of Lizhu bamboo in the area, the lives of local bamboo farmers have improved due to the sale of special products. Luofeng Village is ten li away from Aozai, with a total of 150 households, about 600 people. Among them, there are seven middle-peasant households, with 50 people, and the remaining 143 households, with 580 people, are all poor and hired peasants. They live scattered on the mountainsides on both sides of Luofeng Valley, which is about 20 li long. They maintain their livelihoods by either cutting bamboo or bundling pine. The village produces a maximum of 400,000 bundles of bamboo each year. In 1950, due to the spring famine, the output decreased, but it is estimated that there are still 500,000 bundles (three bundles per load). Apart from children, the elderly, and some people who cannot go out, an average of more than 200 people go out to make a living every day. According to statistics, an average of 1,885 jin of rice can be earned per day. If the total income is divided by the total number of people, then the bamboo farmers in Luofeng Village can earn an average of 3.4 jin of rice per person. If the necessary daily expenses per person are: 1.5 jin of rice for food, 0.5 jin of rice for salt and oil, 0.2 jin of rice for meat, and 0.5 jin of rice for clothing, totaling 2.1 jin of rice, then there is still a surplus of 1.3 jin of rice. In this way, their lives are better than before, and they no longer have to worry about two meals a day. Therefore, the bamboo farmers in the village have the surplus to repair a collapsed ancestral hall to serve as the school site for the peasants' children.

　　广东西江山地农民的生活
    张盛
    广东西江、绥江两岸土产、山货的产量颇为丰富，如广宁至广西的怀集一带，杉松与竹林满山满谷，西江禄步墟附近的桂皮、松香、茨莨、香粉也为土产大宗。这些地方山多田少，土产的购销情况，直接或间接地关系到人民的生活。
    西江高要属禄步墟是西江山货土产集散的重要市场。围绕它的许多山乡如禄镇、禄洞、平南、中端、西康各乡等靠山货、土产松香、桂皮、茨莨等为生的山农，占当地人口百分之三十以上。如禄镇乡的牛皮山村，靠桂皮为生的占全村人口百分之八十；坑尾村靠桂皮及其他山货过活的占全村人口百分之九十五。这些山村人民生活的好坏，直接间接影响禄步墟的繁荣。解放后自广东省土产公司收购各地土产以来，西江山农的生活，已大大地改善了，而禄步墟也已走上繁荣的道路。
    自一九五○年四月至十月间禄步墟山货出口的数量有：总值三百六十六亿七千余万元的桂皮、松香、香粉、松节水等。这笔收入在繁荣农村经济方面实有很大作用。由于周围各乡山农购买力普遍的提高，禄步墟在一九五○年新增了不少商店。据统计，杂货店增加了新新等十二家，布店新增了彭金源等五家，米店新增了万新等四家。从各商店每月进销货额上，也可以看出其繁荣景象。如建新号一九五○年七月份进货五千四百二十九万元，比五月份增加百分之九十一。德兴布店七月份进货额二千四百二十七万元，比五月份增加百分之七十。同时，高要第一区的山农生活也大大地改善，而有余力制裁衣裳了。如第一区的水南墟，增加车衣店六家；中端乡的车衣店也增加了四家。据中端乡第七村合作社干部说：近几个月来第七村合作社代农民购买的土布就有二十余匹（每匹长短不一，有的长二十丈，有的五丈）。第七村的人口约八百人，估计至年终每人平均可购布一丈。
    怀集的坳仔是华南出口特产厘竹的集散地。在这里有占全县百分之十三的人口依靠厘竹为生。据一般的估计，怀集的总面积是八千六百二十八方里，而产竹的地区，几占全县面积七分之一。抗日战争时期，因厘竹销路断绝，山农遭遇到严重的饥荒和灾难。自广东省土产公司与私商组织联营统一购销该地厘竹以来，由于特产的销出，改善了当地竹农的生活。罗逢村离坳仔十华里，村民共一五○户，约六百多口人。其中中农七户，五十人，其余一百四十三户共五百八十人都是贫雇农。他们散住在长约二十里许的罗逢坑两边的山地上。他们维持生活的办法，不是砍竹，便是扎松。该村每年产竹最多有四十万把，一九五○年因为春荒，产量减少，但据估计也有五十万把（每三把一担）。他们除了孩子、老人及一部分不能外出的人外，平均每天约有二百多人在外面谋生。据统计，平均每日可得工资米一千八百八十五斤。如果将总收入和总人数平均计算，那么罗逢村的竹农，平均每人可得米三斤四两。如果每人每日必需支出的费用是：食米一千半、盐油米半斤、肉类米二两、衣服米半斤共需米二斤十两，那末还能余米十两。这样，他们的生活比以前好了，每日二餐也可以不发愁了。因而该村竹农已经有余力来修葺一个倾圯了多年的祠堂，作为农民子弟上学的小学校的校址。
