　　Two Important Issues in Current University Education Work
　　Zhang Ruxin, President of Northeast Normal University
　　　　　　(1) How to Further Develop Teaching Research Guidance Work
The First National Higher Education Conference held last June resolved several major issues in higher education. First, the conference, based on the needs of national construction and the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, determined that the guiding principle and task of higher education in the New China is to cultivate "senior construction talents with a high level of culture, mastering the achievements of modern science and technology, and wholeheartedly serving the people" using methods that unite theory and practice, and at the same time, "prepare for and begin to admit worker and peasant cadres and worker and peasant youth into our universities and colleges to cultivate a new type of intellectual from worker and peasant backgrounds"; second, it adopted the principles and methods of curriculum reform for universities and colleges; in addition, the most important was the regulations concerning the organization and tasks of teaching and research groups. Regarding the latter, Chapter 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Higher Education, adopted by the conference, specifically listed it as a basic teaching organization and clearly stipulated its responsibilities as: (1) leading all teachers in the group to discuss and formulate the teaching plan and syllabus for the group's courses; (2) leading and inspecting the teaching and research work of the group; (3) leading and organizing the self-study, experiments, and internships of the students in the group.
What is the essence of the spirit of this instruction from the National Higher Education Conference? It is that, in order to implement the new education policy and curriculum reform, teachers must be organized, learning strengthened, and mutual assistance practiced in order to successfully complete the task. Because the education policy and curriculum plan are to be implemented and carried out by specific people, and in school teaching work, in addition to correctly determining the policy and curriculum plan, the main decisive role is played by the teachers. If there is a policy and the curriculum is reformed, but the teachers are not well organized to strengthen learning and practice mutual assistance, then these policies and plans will not be realized or cannot be well realized. Therefore, Article 8 of the Decision on Implementing Curriculum Reform in National Higher Education Institutions also wrote:
"Improving the quality of teachers and cultivating new teachers is the key to implementing curriculum reform. Therefore, teachers in national higher education institutions should strive to strengthen their political learning, professional learning, and research work, and should organize teaching research guidance groups for various major courses, where teachers can practice mutual assistance to improve the content and methods of teaching."
Northeast Normal University has had teaching and research groups for more than a year, and the experience of this year has proven that the instructions of the National Higher Education Conference are completely correct and necessary. Past experience has indicated that if the teachers of a course are organized to strengthen learning and practice mutual assistance, then the quality of the teachers of that course will gradually improve, and the content and methods of teaching will be continuously improved, so that the students' academic performance will be better.
Why should we organize to strengthen learning? This is because the New China is a new people's democratic country unprecedented in history, and the higher education policy serving the economic, political, defense, and cultural construction of the New China is also completely new, and the curriculum plan has also been reformed in accordance with the new education policy and the principle of uniting theory and practice. The social science and literature courses offered in our current universities and colleges are taught entirely from a new standpoint, viewpoint, and method; in the field of natural science courses, although many of the original good knowledge are still useful, the content of these courses should also be gradually reformed according to the latest achievements of modern science. As for the teaching methods of the New China's schools, they are also completely new. Therefore, to teach these new courses well and to compile textbooks well is a major event, and we must organize, strengthen learning, and constantly improve our ideological and political level and professional level. It is impossible without learning. Not only education workers who have served in the old education sector for many years need to study well, but also veteran cadres who have participated in cultural and educational work in the liberated areas for many years need to study and improve themselves, otherwise they will not be able to complete the new tasks under the new situation.
Why should we practice mutual assistance? This is because the completion of these tasks is not easy, and the ability and knowledge of each of us are limited, even experts are limited. Therefore, we must adopt the method of "three cobblers equal one Zhuge Liang," and practice mutual assistance on the basis of individual efforts.
In socialist Soviet universities and colleges, they adopted this method long ago and achieved brilliant achievements. For example, many famous textbooks published in the Soviet Union: World History, Russian History, History of War, were all compiled through mutual assistance and collective research by a group of teachers and experts. This valuable experience of the Soviet Union is worth learning well. We should admit that collective strength is greater than individual strength, and collective wisdom is higher than individual wisdom, which is an immutable truth.
In order to practice mutual assistance and learn from each other well, so as to achieve learning from each other's strengths, and mutual improvement in teaching, our teachers must have the spirit of humbly learning. In the past, some teaching and research groups did a better job and had higher teaching quality, one of the reasons is that these teachers were more humble and could often absorb many good opinions from colleagues and even students; the reason why the work of some groups was relatively poor is that some teachers in these groups lacked the spirit of humbly learning. As the ancients said, "Humility brings benefit, and complacency invites loss," which has also been proven here.
Secondly, unity and mutual assistance, mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths, and mutual improvement in teaching cannot be separated from upholding the truth and correcting errors through criticism and self-criticism. We cannot imagine that reforming old education and building new education, such a solemn cause (this is a great transformation in the history of Chinese education unprecedented), can be well completed without launching criticism and self-criticism. Experience indicates that, on the contrary, criticism and self-criticism is the lifeline of the work of the teaching and research group. Without criticism and self-criticism, there can be no sound life of the teaching and research group, and therefore it is impossible to achieve the task of reforming old education and building new education. In the past, many of our teaching and research groups not only formulated curriculum plans and compiled teaching materials after repeated discussions and suggestions, but also organized colleagues to attend each other's classes, inspect teaching, and critically absorb students' opinions, and launched criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, learning and work were very lively, and the relationship between teachers was relatively harmonious. Some other teaching and research groups were polite to each other, and did not raise any opinions for fear of offending people, or the criticized people were unwilling to accept other people's good opinions and stubbornly stuck to their own opinions and acted arbitrarily, so learning and work could not be carried out. The criticism and self-criticism mentioned here, of course, refers to seeking truth from facts and being kind and helpful. That is to say, achievements and progress should be promoted, and shortcomings and errors should be corrected. At the same time, pointing out shortcomings and errors should be based on evidence and analysis, and should be "holding onto reason and speaking with sense," rather than being self-righteous and subjectively arbitrary; the attitude of criticism should be sincere and kind, rather than sarcastic and venting personal emotions; and the criticized comrades should humbly listen, with the attitude of upholding the truth and correcting mistakes, "correcting if there are any, and encouraging if there are none." At the same time, we should advocate a free-thinking, bold debate, in-depth study, and pursuit of truth in academic research, so that everyone dares to express all their inner opinions, and make conclusions that conform to scientific truth through debate to guide teaching. This kind of realistic criticism and self-criticism is as beneficial and necessary to our work as sunlight and fresh air are to people; and from the experience of this period, it is indeed the main key to further developing the work of our teaching and research groups.
From here, we can all more deeply experience the following passage spoken by Chairman Mao not long ago at the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:
"To achieve the goal of consolidating the revolutionary united front, we must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism. The standard used when adopting this method is mainly our current fundamental law, the Common Program. In this meeting, we have adopted the method of criticism and self-criticism based on the Common Program. This is a very good method, a very good method to promote everyone to adhere to the truth and correct mistakes, and the only correct method for all revolutionary people in the people's country to conduct self-education and self-reform. ... I hope that all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all patriotic democrats in the country will adopt this method."
Chairman Mao's instruction is very important. All of us education workers should improve our work well according to the standards of the Common Program, especially the standards in the cultural and educational policy section, and adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism. Anything that conforms to the above standards should be promoted, and those that do not conform or do not fully conform should be appropriately corrected. This is the main key to carrying out the work of the teaching and research group and even the entire teaching work, and it is also the basic method for self-education and self-reform for all of us education workers.
All of us education workers should not be afraid of our lack of knowledge or ability; and even less should we be afraid of the influence of the old society on our thinking (this is inevitable). We are only afraid that we are not conscientious and responsible, do not learn humbly, and are unwilling to adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism instructed by Chairman Mao to carry out self-education and self-reform. As long as we are conscientious and responsible, learn humbly, and often adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to transform ourselves and improve ourselves, then those who lack knowledge and ability can gradually acquire knowledge and ability through learning, those whose knowledge and ability are not enough will gradually improve, and the ideological influence of the old society will gradually be criticized and corrected in the long-term self-education and self-reform. As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world, only fearing those who have a heart," and those comrades who dare to often adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to transform themselves and improve themselves are such people with a heart who can overcome all difficulties. The most important task of the department heads and teaching and research group leaders of each department is to lead by example, to influence all teachers with their own words and actions to learn this new work attitude and work method, so that everyone can continuously strive to improve in this direction.
It should be clearly pointed out that teaching organizations such as teaching and research groups are unique to schools in the New China, and they have never existed and could not have existed in old-style schools in the past; because under the reactionary education policy of old-style schools, teachers were not organized to practice mutual assistance, but instead taught individually, acted in their own way, and even engaged in small groups, small factions, and caused disunity. Criticism and self-criticism was not advocated, but instead mutual attacks and mutual exclusion, or self-preservation and muddling through. Therefore, to build up this new type of organization, and to fulfill its responsibilities well, we must adopt a completely new work attitude and work method, that is, a conscientious and responsible attitude, an attitude of unity and mutual assistance and humble learning, and the method of criticism and self-criticism. Among them, the latter is the most important, because whether or not the method of criticism and self-criticism can be adopted is the main sign of testing whether all our teachers are conscientious and responsible for the people's education cause and learn humbly, and it is also the main measure of the achievements of the work of our teaching and research groups and even all teaching work.
　　　　　　(2) How to Correctly Realize Teaching Democracy
What is teaching democracy? How to use it correctly? What experience have we had in the past? What aspects need to be improved? This is an important issue in the current teaching work, and it needs to be said here.
As far as I know, there are two different understandings and practices of teaching democracy in formal schools now. One is to advocate so-called "self-study guidance," excessively emphasizing students' independent "self-study," and ignoring or negating the leading role and educational role of teachers. For example, in some schools, when students are in class, teachers stand aside and let students freely discuss democratically, or let students spend most of the time in class discussing and arguing, leaving only a little time for teachers to summarize, or, if students have questions about the course, they let students answer them themselves, and teachers only guide them from the side, and some schools indiscriminately accommodate students' opinions. School leaders and teachers do not have a certain responsibility system and work plan. Even individual schools have adopted the method of student voting to decide the pronunciation of a certain word.
This kind of "teaching democracy" is actually letting go of teaching work, negating the leading role and educational role of teachers, and it is harmful and useless to teaching work.
The other is to acknowledge the leading role of teachers in school teaching work, and at the same time advocate that teachers should appropriately adopt democratic working methods to critically absorb students' opinions and strengthen contact with students to improve teaching. The teaching democracy promoted by Northeast Normal University in the past was generally done in this direction.
In order to understand this issue more deeply, I think it is necessary to explain the organizational principles of the school. What should be the organizational and management principles of schools in the New China (including our school)? Some people say it is democratic centralism, but I think this statement is incorrect. If it is democratic centralism, then the school principal and teachers should be elected by everyone, and the school should hold regular representative meetings where the principal makes a work report to the voters, which is approved by the voters.... It is not like this. The school principal (and other responsible comrades) are not elected by everyone, but appointed by the higher-level people's government; the teachers are hired by the principal, not elected by the students; the school principal is entrusted by the higher-level people's government to manage the school on behalf of the higher-level government. Important decisions must be reported to the higher-level government for instructions and approved by the higher-level government, and the principal is fully responsible for daily work. Teachers are hired by the principal and are responsible to the principal for carrying out educational work. That is to say, the organizational and management principle of the school is not democratic centralism, but the principal responsibility system, and the teacher responsibility system in classroom education.
However, in order to do a good job, the school principal and teachers must adopt democratic working methods, that is, they should solicit opinions from school staff and students, pool ideas and gather strength, in order to more effectively promote the work. In order to "pool ideas and gather strength," the principal should regularly hold various meetings in administration, such as school affairs committee meetings, academic affairs meetings, etc., to absorb certain responsible comrades (responsible comrades of the school, department heads, teacher representatives, teaching and research group leaders, etc. participate, and student union and trade union leaders attend as non-voting delegates), and discuss and study methods with everyone on many major issues in the school's work, and solicit opinions. In addition, they should also regularly talk to people below individually to understand the situation, discover problems, and solicit opinions. According to past experience, this approach has a great effect on strengthening contact between superiors and subordinates, understanding the situation in a timely manner, researching work, and summarizing work experience. Is it okay without these? That is not okay. However, the above-mentioned meetings are conducted under the leadership of the principal and other responsible comrades, according to the intentions of the leadership, with leadership, organization, and planning. The resolutions of the meetings must be approved by the principal (the latter has the power to veto the decisions of the school affairs committee and other meetings in terms of authority), rather than solving problems according to the principle of the minority obeying the majority like the council of a trade union or the committee of the government. This is the combination of the principal responsibility system and democratic working methods.
Teachers are fully responsible for teaching, but in order to do a good job in teaching, they must also adopt democratic working methods, always pay attention to understanding the teaching situation, and critically absorb students' opinions (colleagues' opinions should be absorbed even more). The methods and forms can be through class representatives to reflect the situation and opinions (this is a regular method), or spend time to participate in a group to ask students' opinions, or regularly hold various symposiums (absorbing active elements among students to participate) or meetings of all students (absorbing a class of students to participate according to the needs of a certain course, and absorbing more students to participate in more general issues). Through class representatives and the above-mentioned meetings, teachers can understand the teaching situation, absorb students' valuable opinions as a reference for improving teaching, and at the same time, they can also understand the students' specific ideological trends through these forms, and educate students on policies, learning attitudes, and learning methods, and correct incorrect tendencies among students in a timely manner. In this way, our teaching work can be completely built on the basis of students' consciousness, and at the same time, it can be more closely combined with the actual situation of students (such as students' actual cultural level, acceptance ability, students' ideological reality, etc.).
However, these meetings must be conducted under the responsible leadership of teachers or teaching and research group leaders. At the same time, in order to hold these meetings well, there should be brewing and preparation in advance, so that the meetings can be conducted with leadership, organization, and a center, rather than being unled, boundless, and letting students discuss on their own, so that no results can be obtained. Secondly, the decisions of these meetings must be agreed by the teacher or teaching and research group leader (issues related to the entire department must also be approved by the department head) rather than the minority obeying the majority, or indiscriminately accommodating students' opinions. This is the combination of the teacher responsibility system and democratic working methods.
This democratic working method is a concrete manifestation of the responsible viewpoint and mass viewpoint of teachers serving the people in education. Because teachers play a leading role in school education, and teachers teaching students is a serious and responsible job, which is responsible to the higher authorities and also responsible to the students (these two aspects are not opposed), so in order to teach the courses better and for students to learn better, in addition to the correct leadership of the higher authorities and the teachers' own efforts (this is the main thing), it is also necessary to strengthen contact with students and absorb students' valuable opinions. Doing so is only beneficial and has no disadvantages. However, if we negate the teacher's responsibility system and talk about democracy in a vacuum, we will lose leadership and move towards letting go, and the result will be detrimental to teaching work. Such an approach is not called having a mass viewpoint, but a misunderstanding of the mass viewpoint.
The past experience of Northeast Normal University proves that adopting this scientific democratic method has many benefits. Students have reflected many situations and put forward many suggestions through class representatives and various symposiums (from teaching plans, textbooks, teaching content and methods, and even the positions and views of some teachers in analyzing problems). These suggestions have played a certain role in promoting the improvement of teaching work. Experience indicates that the teacher who can adopt democratic working methods and critically absorb students' opinions is more likely to have the content and methods of his course adapted to the students' actual cultural level and acceptance ability, and be continuously improved, so that the students' academic performance in that course is better.
On the other hand, past experience has told us that there are indeed many inappropriate and even wrong opinions among students' opinions. For example, some students have an unclear understanding of the school's policies, lack a correct understanding of the connection between theory and practice, and therefore have various wrong ideas of aiming too high and being divorced from reality. The opinions reflected by some class representatives often only represent students with a higher level, and some students give opinions to teachers not with a kind and helpful attitude, etc. These ideas and opinions are sometimes unavoidable. We cannot make unprincipled concessions to this. Inappropriate opinions should be appropriately explained and corrected, and fundamentally wrong opinions and attitudes should be seriously criticized and educated, otherwise it will hinder the progress of teaching work. We have generally done this in the past, and we should continue to handle it in this spirit in the future.
Secondly, some of the symposiums held by our units are chaired by class representatives, which is inappropriate. They should be chaired by teachers or teaching and research group leaders, and student symposiums belonging to the entire department should be chaired by the department head.
Here, I will briefly mention the name of the "Teacher-Student Symposium." In the past, the teaching symposiums held by many units of Northeast Normal University were named "Teacher-Student Symposium," which somewhat contained the element of equal consultation between teachers and students. In fact, teachers and students are indeed equal in politics and personality, but they are obviously different in terms of work responsibilities. The only task of students in school is to study, while teachers are responsible for educating students in their positions. Therefore, strictly speaking, it is inappropriate to call this kind of teaching symposium "Teacher-Student Symposium," and it should not be continued in the future.
In summary, the use of democratic working methods on the basis of the teacher responsibility system is the teaching democracy that we advocate, which is also the so-called organized and led teaching democracy. Past experience has proven that the correct use of this democratic working method not only does not hinder respect for teachers and the teacher's responsibility system in education, but can also better harmonize the relationship between teachers and students and give full play to the teacher's leading role and educational role. In the past, we taught students to respect teachers on the one hand, and suggested that teachers adopt democratic working methods on the other hand to strengthen the connection between teachers and students. Wherever this was done, the teaching quality was higher, and the teacher's prestige was better, and the relationship between teachers and students was more harmonious. This democratic working method has a significant promoting effect, especially in the transition from the old-style formal education to the new-style formal education, and therefore it should be appropriately summarized and promoted.
Finally, it should also be pointed out that this scientific democratic working method and democratic style can only be advocated and promoted in people's schools, and have never existed and could not exist in old-style schools. In the past, the relationship between teachers and students in Chinese feudal society was a relationship of hierarchical obedience. The ruling class at that time, in order to implement its policy of raising scholars and deceiving the people, raised the status of teachers relatively high (among the five respects of heaven, earth, monarch, parents, and teachers, teachers were listed as one respect). Teachers were sacred and inviolable in front of students, and students could only blindly obey teachers, while teachers could casually beat, scold, and insult students. In the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China era, the essence of this relationship between teachers and students did not change much. This atmosphere was combined with the reactionary autocracy in politics at that time. Now we are in the era of the New China, and our schools are people's schools. Therefore, the relationship between teachers and students in schools cannot but change with the changes in the entire political and economic system. This is very obvious.

　　目前大学教育工作中的两个重要问题
    东北师范大学校长  张如心
            （一）如何进一步开展教学研究指导的工作
    去年六月召开的第一次全国高等教育会议曾经解决了高等教育的几个主要问题。首先会议根据国家建设的需要和人民政协共同纲领确定了新中国高等教育的方针和任务是以理论与实际一致的方法，培养“具有高度文化水平、掌握现代科学与技术的成就并全心全意为人民服务的高级建设人才”，同时“准备和开始吸收工农干部和工农青年进我们的高等学校，以培养工农出身的新型知识分子”；其次，是通过了高等学校课程改革的原则与方法；除此以外，最重要的就是关于教研组的组织和任务的规定。关于后者，会议通过的高等学校暂行规程的第四章曾经把它列为教学的基本组织并明确规定了它的职责为：（一）领导本组全体教师讨论及制定本组课目的教学计划与教学大纲；（二）领导及检查本组的教学工作和研究工作；（三）领导与组织本组学生的自习、实验及实习。
    全国高等教育会议这一指示的精神实质是什么呢？就是为了贯彻新的教育方针与课程改革必须把教员组织起来，加强学习，实行互助才能很好地完成任务。因为教育方针与课程计划是要通过一定的人来执行和贯彻的，而在学校教学工作中除了正确地决定方针与课程计划之外，起主要的决定作用的就是教员。如果方针有啦，课程也改革啦，而不把教员很好地组织起来加强学习，实行互助，那末这些方针、计划也还是不能实现或是不能很好地实现的。所以高等教育会议关于实施全国高等学校课程改革决定的第八条也曾经这样写着：
    “提高师资的质量和培养新的师资是实施课程改革的关键，因此全国高等学校的教师应努力加强自己的政治学习、业务学习及研究工作，应就各项主要课程，组织教学研究指导组，由教师实行互助，改进教学的内容与方法。”
    东北师范大学自从有了教研组以来已经一年多了，这一年多的经验证明了全国高等教育会议的指示是完全正确的和必要的。过去经验指明：那一门课程的教师如果组织起来，加强学习，实行互助，那一门课程的教师质量也就逐渐提高了，教课的内容同方法也就得到不断的改进，从而学生的学习成绩也就比较好。
    为什么要组织起来加强学习呢？这是因为新中国是有史以来前所未有的新的人民民主国家，而服务于新中国的经济、政治、国防、文化建设的高等教育方针也完全是新的，课程计划也是按照新的教育方针以及理论与实际一致的原则而改革过来的。我们现在高等学校开办的社会科学及文学课程完全是用新的立场、观点、方法来讲授的；自然科学课程方面，虽然原有的许多好的知识都还是有用的，但是这些课程的内容也应该根据现代科学最新的成就有步骤地加以改革。至若新中国学校的教学方法那也完全是新的。因此，我们要把这些新的课程教好，把教材编好，这是一件大事，就必须组织起来，加强学习，不断地提高自己的思想政治水平与业务水平。不学习是不成的。不仅过去在旧教育界服务过多年的教育工作者要很好地学习，就是参加过多年解放区文教工作的老干部也都需要好好地学习和提高，否则就无法完成新形势下的新的任务。
    为什么要实行互助呢？这是因为这些任务的完成是不很容易的，并且我们每个人的能力和知识都是有限的，就是专家也还是有限的，因此必须采取“三个臭皮匠，凑成一个诸葛亮”的方法，在个人努力的基础上面，实行互助。
    在社会主义苏联的高等学校，他们早就采取了这个方法，并获得了辉煌的成就。例如苏联出版的许多有名的教科书：世界史、俄国史、战争史，都是经过一批教师、专家实行互助，集体研究，编写出来的。苏联这一宝贵经验是值得我们很好地来学习的。我们应该承认集体力量大于个人力量，集体智慧高于个人智慧，这是一条不可移易的真理。
    为要很好地实行互助，相互学习，以达到取长补短，教学相长，我们的教师就必须有虚心学习的精神。我们过去一个时期有少数教研组工作搞的比较好，教学质量比较高，其原因之一就是因为这一部分教师比较虚心，能经常吸取同仁甚至学生的许多好的意见；有些小组工作成绩之所以比较差，就是因为这些小组的某些教员虚心学习的精神不够。古人云：“谦受益，满招损”，在这里也得到了证明。
    再其次，团结互助，相互学习，取长补短，教学相长——这些都离不开坚持真理，纠正错误的批评与自我批评。我们不能这样设想：改革旧教育，建设新教育，这样一件庄严的事业（这是中国教育史上前所未有的伟大转变）而可以不展开批评与自我批评就能够很好的完成的。经验指明：恰好相反，批评与自我批评是教研组工作的生命线，没有批评与自我批评就不可能有健全的教研组生活，因而也就不可能达成改革旧教育建设新教育的任务。过去我们有好些教研组不仅制定课程计划编写教材是经过大家反复讨论提出意见，而且还组织了同仁相互听课，检查教学，并批判地吸取了学生的意见，展开了批评与自我批评，因此学习和工作就很有生气，教师的相互关系也搞得比较融洽。另外一些教研组因为大家客客气气，有意见不提，怕得罪人，或者被批评的人不愿意接受别人好的意见而固执己见，自行其是，因此学习与工作就无法开展。这里所谈的批评与自我批评当然是指实事求是的，与人为善的，这就是说：成绩与进步应该发扬，缺点错误应该纠正，同时指出缺点错误是有根有据，经过分析，是“持之有故，言之成理”，而不是自以为是，主观武断；批评的态度应该是诚恳的，与人为善的，而不是冷嘲热讽，闹私人意气；而被批评的同志则应该虚心倾听，抱着坚持真理，修正错误，“有则改之，无则加勉”的态度。同时，我们在学术研究上应该提倡自由思想，大胆辩论，深入钻研，追求真理的风气，使大家敢于把自己内心的一切意见说出来，经过争辩作出合乎科学真理的结论，以指导教学。这种实事求是的批评与自我批评，对于我们的工作，正象太阳光与新鲜空气对于人们一样是十分有益和十分必需的；而且从这一时期的工作经验来看，它的确是进一步开展我们教研组工作的主要关键。
    从这里我们大家就可以更深刻地体验到毛主席不久以前在人民政协全国委员会第二次全体会议上讲的下列一段话：
    “要达到巩固革命统一战线的目的，必须采取批评和自我批评的方法。采取这种方法时所用的标准，主要是我们现时的根本大法即共同纲领。我们在这次会议中，即根据共同纲领，采取了批评和自我批评的方法。这是一个很好的方法，是推动大家坚持真理、修正错误的很好的方法，是人民国家内全体革命人民进行自我教育和自我改造的惟一正确的方法。……我希望全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和一切爱国民主人士，都采用这种方法。”
    毛主席这一指示甚为重要。我们全体教育工作者应该很好地根据共同纲领的标准，特别是其中关于文教政策部分的标准，采取批评与自我批评的方法来改进我们的工作，一切符合于上述标准的应加以发扬，不符合的或不完全符合应适当地加以纠正。这是开展教研组工作以至于整个教学工作的主要关键，也是我们全体教育工作者的自我教育与自我改造的基本方法。
    我们全体教育工作者不要害怕自己的知识不够，能力不够；更不要害怕我们思想上存有旧社会的影响（这是难免的），我们只怕自己不认真负责，不虚心学习，不愿意采用毛主席所指示的批评与自我批评的方法来进行自我教育与自我改造。只要我们认真负责，虚心学习，经常采用批评与自我批评的方法来改造自己提高自己，则没有知识与能力的，经过学习就可以逐渐获得知识与能力，知识能力不够的也会逐渐提高，旧社会的思想影响也会在长期的自我教育与自我改造中逐渐得到批判和纠正。俗语说：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，那些敢于经常采取批评与自我批评的方法来改造自己提高自己的同志便是这种能够战胜一切困难的有心人。各系的系主任及教研组长最主要的任务就是以身作则，以自己的言论和行动来影响全体教师学会这个新的工作态度与工作方法，使大家朝着这一方向不断地努力改进。
    应该明确地指出：教研组这样的教学组织是新中国学校中所特有的，它在过去旧式学校中是从来没有，而且也不可能有的；因在旧式学校的反动教育方针之下，教师不是被组织起来实行互助，而是各自为教，各行其是，甚至搞小团体、小宗派、闹不团结，是不提倡批评与自我批评，而是互相攻讦，互相排挤，或者明哲保身，得过且过。因此，我们要把这一新式的组织健全起来，很好地履行它的职责，就必须采用完全新的工作态度和工作方法，这就是认真负责的态度，团结互助，虚心学习的态度，批评与自我批评的方法。其中尤其是后者最为重要，因为能不能采取批评与自我批评的方法，正是考验我们全体教师对人民教育事业是否认真负责，虚心学习的主要标志，也是测量我们教研组工作以至一切教学工作的成绩的主要尺度。
            （二）如何正确实现教学民主
    什么叫教学民主？如何正确运用？过去我们有什么经验？那些方面需要改进？这是当前教学工作中一个重要问题，需要在这里说一下。
    据我所知，现在正规学校中对教学民主有两种不同的了解及做法。一种是提倡所谓“自学辅导”，过份强调学生独立“自学”，忽视或者否定教师的主导作用与教育作用。如有的学校学生上课时，教师站在一边，尽让学生去自由地民主讨论，或者把上课大部分的时间让学生自己去讨论争辩，只留下很少的时间给教师作总结，或者，学生对课程有疑问让学生自己去解答，教师只是从旁指导，有的学校对学生意见无批判的迁就，学校负责人及教员没有一定的责任制和工作计划。甚至个别学校为了要决定某一字的读法，采取了由学生举手表决的方法来解决。
    这种“教学民主”实际上是对教学工作的放任自流，是否定教师的主导作用与教育作用，它对于教学工作是有害无益的。
    另一种，是承认教师在学校教学工作中的主导作用，同时并提倡教师应适当地采用民主的工作方式来批判地吸收学生的意见，加强与学生的联系以改进教学。东北师范大学过去所推行的教学民主大体上是朝着这个方向做的。
    为了更深刻地了解这一问题，我觉得对于学校的组织原则有说明的必要。新中国的学校（包括我们学校在内）的组织与管理原则应该是怎样的呢？有人说是民主集中制，我认为这种说法是不对的。如果是民主集中制，则学校校长及教师应该是由大家选举的，学校应该定期召开代表大会由校长向选民作工作报告，经过选民批准……。不是这样，学校校长（及其他负责同志）不是大家选出来的，而是上级人民政府委任的；教师是校长聘请的，不是学生选举的；学校校长受上级人民政府委托，代表上级政府来办理学校，重要决定须向上级政府请示，经过上级批准，日常工作则由校长负全责，教师是受校长聘任对校长负责进行教育工作。这就是说，学校的组织与管理原则不是民主集中制，而是校长负责制，以及在课堂教育上的教师负责制。
    但是为了搞好工作，学校校长及教师必须采取民主的工作方式，这就是说，应该向学校工作人员及学生吸取意见，集思广益，以便更有效的推进工作。校长为了“集思广益，群策群力”，在行政上应该定期召开各种会议如校务委员会会议，教务会议等，吸收一定负责同志（校部负责同志、系主任、教师代表、教研组长等参加，学生会及工会负责人列席），就学校工作中的许多重大问题同大家商量研究办法，吸取意见。除此以外，还应该定期找下面的人员个别谈话，了解情况，发现问题，吸取意见。根据过去的经验，这样的做法对于密切上下级的联系，及时地了解情况，研讨工作及总结工作经验，有很大的作用。没有这些行不行？那是不行的。但是上述的会议都是在校长及其他负责同志主持下，按照领导上的意图，有领导有组织有计划地进行，会议的决议要经过校长批准（后者对校务委员会及其他会议的决定在职权上可以否定），而不是像工会的理事会或政府的委员会按照少数服从多数的原则来解决问题的。这就是校长负责制与民主工作方式的结合。
    教员对教课负完全的责任，但为了搞好教学工作也必须采取民主工作方式，经常注意了解教学的情况，批判地吸取学生的意见（同仁的意见更应吸取），其方法和形式可通过课代表反映情况和意见（这是经常的方法），或者自己抽出时间参加一个小组询问学生的意见，或者定期召开各种座谈会（吸收学生中的积极分子参加）或全体学生会议（以某一门课程的需要吸收某一班学生参加，更普遍的问题吸收更多的学生参加）。通过课代表及上述会议，教师一方面可以了解教学的情况，吸取学生中有价值的意见，作为改进教学的参考，同时另一方面，又可通过这些形式了解学生的具体思想动态，对学生进行有关于方针政策、学习态度、学习方法的教育，及时纠正学生中不正确的偏向。这样就可以使我们的教学工作完全建筑在学生自觉的基础上面，同时又使它能够更加密切地结合学生的实际（如学生的实际文化水平，接受能力，学生的思想实际等等）。
    但是这些会议必须是在教员或教研组长负责主持之下进行，同时为了开好这些会议，在事先应有所酝酿，有所准备，使会议有领导有组织有中心地来进行，而不是无领导的，漫无边际的，让学生自己去讨论，因而得不到任何结果。其次，这些会议的决定必须取得教师或教研组长的同意（与整个系有关的问题还要经过系主任批准）而不是少数服从多数，或者无原则的迁就学生意见。这就是教师负责制与民主工作方式的结合。
    这种民主工作方式是教师在教育工作中为人民服务的负责观点与群众观点的具体表现。因为教师在学校教育工作中是起主导作用的，教师给学生教课是一种严肃负责的工作，是对上级负责，同时也是对学生负责的（这两方面不是对立的），所以为了把课程教得更好，学生学得更好，除了上级正确领导与教师自己努力（这是主要的）之外，还必须加强与学生的联系吸取学生有价值的意见，这样做是只有好处而没有任何坏处的。但是如果否定教师的负责制而去空谈民主则会失去领导而走向放任自流，其结果对教学工作是有损无益的。这样的做法不叫做有群众观点，而是对于群众观点的误解。
    东北师范大学过去的经验证明：采取这种科学的民主方式是有不少的好处，学生通过课代表及各种座谈会反映了不少情况，提出了不少建议（从教学计划、教材、讲课内容与方法，甚至某些教师分析问题的立场观点都有），这些建议对于改进教学工作是起了一定的推动作用。经验指明：那一位教师能够采取民主工作方式，批判地吸取学生的意见，那末他的课程讲授内容和方法就比较地能够适应学生的实际文化水平及接受能力，而得到不断的改进，从而学生对于该课程的学习成绩也就比较好。
    另一方面，过去的经验又告诉我们：学生的意见中的确有不少不妥当，甚至是错误的意见。如有的学生对于学校方针认识不清，对于理论与实际的联系缺乏正确的理解，因而有好高鹜远及脱离实际的各种错误想法，有的课代表反映的意见常常只是代表程度较高的学生，有的学生给教员提意见不是抱着与人为善的态度等等。这些想法和意见有时是难免的。对此我们不能作无原则的迁就，对不妥当的意见应适当地加以解释和纠正，对根本错误的意见和态度应严肃地进行批判和教育，不然会妨碍教学工作的进行。我们过去大体是这样做了，今后仍应本此精神办理。
    再其次，我们有些单位召开的座谈会是由课代表主持，这是不妥当的，应该由教师或教研组长主持，属于全系的学生座谈会应由系主任主持。
    这里附带的谈几句关于“师生座谈会”的名称。过去东北师范大学好些单位召开的教学座谈会曾命名为“师生座谈会”，这一名称多少含有师生双方平等协商的因素在内。其实教师与学生，在政治上人格上固然是平等的，然而在工作的责任上是显然不同的，学生在学校的唯一的任务是学习，而教师在职务上担负着教育学生的责任。因此，严格地说，把这种教学座谈会冠以“师生座谈会”的名称是不恰当的，今后不宜继续采用。
    总起来说，在教师负责制的基础上，运用民主的工作方式，就是我们所提倡的教学民主，也就是所谓的有组织有领导的教学民主。以往的经验证明：这种民主工作方式的正确运用不仅不妨碍尊师与教师在教育上的负责制，而且可以更好地融洽师生关系和发挥教师的主导作用及教育作用。过去我们一方面教导学生尊重教师，另一面又建议教师采取民主工作方式，以加强师生的联系。凡是这样做的地方，那里教学质量就比较高，从而教员的威信也比较好，师生关系也就比较融洽。这种民主工作方式，特别在从旧型正规教育转向新型正规教育中有它显著的推动作用，因此应适当地加以总结和发扬。
    最后还应该指出一点：这种科学的民主工作方式，民主的作风只有在人民的学校中才有可能被提倡与发扬，而在旧式学校是从来没有过而且是不可能有的。过去中国封建社会里头的师生关系是一种等级服从的关系。当时的统治阶级为了贯彻其养士政策与愚民政策，因而把教师的地位提得比较高（天、地、君、亲、师五尊中，师长被列为一尊），教师在学生前面是神圣不可侵犯的，学生对教师只是盲目的服从而教师对学生反可以随便打骂侮辱。在半殖民地半封建的旧中国时代，这种教师与学生的关系本质上没有多大改变。这种风气是与当时政治上的反动专制主义相结合的。现在我们是处在新中国的时代，我们的学校是人民的学校，因此学校中师生关系也就不能不随着整个政治经济制度的改变而有所改变，这是很显然的了。
