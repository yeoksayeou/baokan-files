　　Economic Life Trends
            Changsha Industrial and Commercial Circles Actively Pay Taxes
    The industrial and commercial circles in Changsha are earnestly fulfilling their patriotic pledges and have launched a tax payment campaign since mid-January. As of the end of January, all outstanding industrial and commercial taxes from 1950, winter industrial and commercial taxes, local surtaxes, and January's business tax have been paid into the treasury. The preparatory committee of the Changsha Federation of Industry and Commerce has sent telegrams to industrial and commercial circles in major cities in the Central and Southern regions such as Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Kaifeng, Nanning, and Guilin, challenging them and hoping to jointly practice patriotic pledges and strive to consolidate the economic front of the motherland.
            Guizhou Salt Supply Problem Largely Resolved
    Guizhou Province does not produce salt, and the people's salt supply has always relied on Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. However, due to inconvenient transportation, salt prices are extremely high, and some farmers can only afford to eat bland food. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government led the Salt Affairs Bureau and other relevant authorities last year to vigorously organize salt transportation and sales. Currently, the price of salt throughout the province has fallen to the equivalent of four to ten catties of rice per catty of salt, whereas in the past, it was necessary to exchange eighty to one hundred and twenty catties of rice for one catty of salt. In Guiyang, the current selling price of each dan (a unit of weight) of salt is 280,000 yuan, and in the more remote Dushan Special District, each dan of salt sells for only 340,000 yuan.
            Unprecedented Development of Telecommunications in Xinjiang
    Through rectification, restoration, and focused business development over the past year by the Dihua Telecommunications Bureau and its affiliated local telecommunications bureaus, telecommunications throughout Xinjiang Province have gradually become smooth. Furthermore, due to the efforts of all employees in continuously improving work efficiency and saving equipment and fuel, Xinjiang's telecommunications industry has fundamentally changed the corrupt phenomenon of the Kuomintang reactionary rule era, which required subsidies of 40% to 50% of expenses. Last year, the total operating income of the province increased by 95% compared to 1949, and after expenses, the surplus reached 20% of the income, equivalent to 3.5 million yuan in new currency.

　　经济生活动态
            长沙市工商界积极纳税
    长沙市工商界认真履行爱国公约，一月中旬以来展开了竞缴税款的热潮。截至一月底，全市一九五○年的工商业税全部尾欠、冬季工商业税、地方附加税以及本年一月份的营业税已全部入库。市工商联筹委会已打电报给武汉、广州、南昌、开封、南宁、桂林等中南区大中城市工商界，向他们挑战，并希望共同实践爱国公约，为巩固祖国的经济战线而奋斗。
            贵州食盐供应问题已大部解决
    贵州省不产食盐，人民食盐一向仰仗四川、云南两省供应。但由于交通运输不便，食盐价格极高，有的农民因而只能淡食。贵州省人民政府曾于去年领导盐务局等有关机关大力组织食盐运销。现全省食盐价格已下降到每斤食盐相等于四斤到十斤大米之间，而过去必须拿八十到一百二十斤大米才能换到一斤食盐。贵阳目前每担食盐售价为二十八万元，较偏僻的独山专区每担食盐也只售三十四万元。
            新疆电信事业空前发展
    迪化电信管理局及所属各地电信局，经过去年一年的整顿、恢复与有重点的发展业务，新疆全省的电信往来已逐渐畅通。又由于全体职工的努力，不断提高工作效率和节省器材油料，使新疆的电信事业，基本上改变了国民党反动统治时期需要贴补百分之四十到五十经费的腐朽现象。去年全省总的营业收入，较一九四九年增加百分之九十五，除开支外，盈余达收入的百分之二十，折合新币三百五十万元。
