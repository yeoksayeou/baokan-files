The case of Han Xi Ba, purchasing agent of the Xizhang Village Cooperative in Huoxian County, Shanxi Province.

In August of last year, Han Xi Ba, purchasing agent of the Xizhang Village Cooperative in Huoxian County, took six shi of sesame and seven shi of wheat to Shijiazhuang to purchase embossing shafts and cotton carding machines. However, Han Xi Ba completely forgot his mission and went to Beijing for half a month, spending public funds to make a uniform for himself and buy leather shoes and sweaters for his wife. The remaining funds were used to purchase a large quantity of high-quality cigarettes and some paint. His reckless spending of the members' shares caused great losses to the cooperative. After returning to the cooperative, Han Xi Ba even unreasonably demanded to be paid for his business trip. These events aroused unanimous anger among the cooperative members. The county cooperative therefore convened a board meeting and a meeting of member representatives, severely criticizing him, removing him from his position, and recovering the embezzled public funds.

　  贪污渎职引起社员公愤
    山西霍县西掌村合作社采购员韩希把于去年八月携带芝麻六石、麦子七石，到石家庄购买压花轴、弹花车。但韩希把却把自己的任务忘得干干净净，竟私行到北京逛荡了半个月，并动用公款给自己做制服，给老婆买皮鞋、毛衣等物。其余的款子则购买了大批上等香烟和一部分颜料。社员的股金被他这样胡花乱买，使该社受到很大的损失。韩希把返社后还无理要求发给他出差的工资。这些事引起了社员的一致愤怒。县社为此并召开了理事会和社员代表会议，对他进行严格的批评，罢免了他的职务，并追还挪用的公款。
