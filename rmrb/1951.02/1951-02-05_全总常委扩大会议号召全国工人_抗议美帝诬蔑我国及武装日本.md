Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Standing Committee Enlarged Meeting issued a letter to workers nationwide opposing the United States' manipulation of the United Nations to illegally pass a resolution slandering our country and plotting to rearm Japan. The full text is as follows:

Comrades, men and women workers and staff across the country!

Recently, US imperialism manipulated the United Nations to reject the proposal by twelve Asian and Arab countries to convene a seven-nation conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and illegally passed the US proposal, falsely accusing our just action of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea as "aggression." This is the greatest insult and slander to the people of our country. This makes us even more aware that US imperialism is barbaric, unreasonable, reverses right and wrong, wants only war and not peace, and is not only the mortal enemy of all the Chinese people, but also the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people in the world!

Everyone knows that the United States is more than 15,000 miles away from China and Korea, separated by the vast Pacific Ocean. However, it is US imperialism that supports Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out counter-revolutionary wars, instructs Syngman Rhee to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and directly sends troops to invade Taiwan and Korea! The heinous crimes committed by the US invading army in Korea and on our border are clearly seen by the people of the world. US imperialism's attempt to cover up the eyes and ears of the world is absolutely impossible.

The Chinese people have always loved peace. Only when US imperialism occupied our Taiwan, the US imperialist air force repeatedly bombed and strafed our border cities, and the US imperialist invading army was about to rush to the northeastern border of our country, could our people no longer tolerate it, and organized volunteer forces to aid the Korean people and severely strike at the US imperialist invading army. This great and just action of resisting aggression, saving neighbors and saving ourselves, and being infinitely loved by the Korean people, can absolutely not be slandered by the illegal resolution of the United Nations manufactured by US imperialism. The solemn and righteous statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government on this issue is exactly what all our workers and the people of the whole country want to say, and we unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

Fellow workers: Why does the United States want to slander us as "aggression"? This is because the US imperialist invading army was defeated in Korea, its soldiers are unwilling to fight, and many countries are demanding a peaceful negotiation to resolve the Korean issue. Thus, the US government is arrogantly pressuring its vassals to follow it in biting us back, making it impossible for its vassal states to oppose its continued expansion of the war of aggression.

Fellow workers, US imperialism is extremely hostile to the victory and liberation of our people! US imperialism does not want us to have a peaceful environment to build a new China! US imperialism still dreams of turning China into its colony and turning the Chinese people into its slaves for generations! In order to expand its aggression, it not only forced its vassals in the United Nations to pass slander against our country, but also sent the famous war-monger Dulles to Japan to carry out the conspiracy of a separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearmament of Japan, attempting to drive Japan to participate in the US's criminal war of aggression against Asia.

Fellow workers! Each of us has personally suffered the pain of enslavement, humiliation, oppression, and massacre by the Japanese warlords. We went through eight years of bloody sacrifice in the War of Resistance before overthrowing these Japanese warlords and seeing the light of day again. Now, US imperialism is attempting to rearm Japan to invade our country. We must unite with the Japanese people and the people of Southeast Asian countries to resolutely oppose it to the end!

Fellow workers! We have the strength and confidence to smash all the aggressive plans of US imperialism. Chairman Mao said long ago that US imperialism is just a paper tiger. Our heroic People's Volunteer Army, together with the Korean People's Army, has repeatedly defeated and routed the US imperialist invading army. As long as all the workers and all the people of China unite under the banner of our wise leader Chairman Mao, and unite with the workers of Asian countries and the world, and fight to the end, we will surely be able to smash any aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism!

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Standing Committee Enlarged Meeting calls on all male and female workers across the country to resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of February 2nd and continue to expand the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We must use the organized and disciplined actions of our working class, and use our gatherings and demonstrations, to protest the insult of the United States to our great motherland and oppose the US rearming of Japan! We must assist the government in suppressing the US-Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionaries, eliminate any hidden secret agents in industrial and mining enterprises, and consolidate our own positions! We must continue to carry out patriotic emulation, expand and persist in the Ma Hengchang Team emulation movement, as a regular manifestation of our patriotic actions!

Down with the US aggressors! Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Long live our great motherland!

### 全总常委扩大会议号召全国工人  抗议美帝诬蔑我国及武装日本

　　全总常委扩大会议号召全国工人
    抗议美帝诬蔑我国及武装日本
    【新华社四日讯】中华全国总工会常委扩大会议发表反对美国操纵联合国非法通过诬蔑我国议案并阴谋重新武装日本告全国工人书，全文如下：全国各地男女工人职员同志们！
    最近美帝国主义操纵联合国拒绝十二个亚洲和阿拉伯国家所提的召开七国会议，和平解决朝鲜问题的议案，并非法通过美国的提案，把我们抗美援朝的正义行动诬指为“侵略”，这是对我国人民的极大侮辱、诽谤。这就使我们更认清了美帝国主义野蛮无理，颠倒是非，只要战争，不要和平，不但是全中国人民的死敌，而且是全世界一切爱好和平的人类的死敌！
    谁都知道，美国距离中国和朝鲜有一万五千多里，中间还隔了广阔的太平洋。但是支持蒋介石进行反革命战争，指使李承晚进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且直接出兵侵略台湾朝鲜的，却正是美帝国主义！美国侵略军在朝鲜和我国边境的种种惨无人道的罪行，全世界人民看得清清楚楚。美帝国主义企图一手掩尽天下人的耳目，是绝对作不到的。
    中国人民从来是热爱和平的。只有到美帝国主义侵占了我国的台湾，美帝国主义的空军多次轰炸扫射我国边境城市，美帝国主义的侵略军，已经快要冲到我国东北边境的时候，我国人民才忍无可忍，组成志愿部队援助朝鲜人民，给美帝国主义的侵略军以严重打击。这种反抗侵略的、救邻自救的、受到朝鲜人民无比爱戴的伟大的正义的行动，绝对不是美帝国主义一手制造的联合国非法决议所能诬蔑得了的。中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长关于这个问题的义正辞严的声明，正是我们全体工人和全国人民所要说的话，我们一致拥护周外长的声明。
    工友们：为什么美国要诬蔑我们为“侵略”呢？这是因为美帝国主义的侵略军在朝鲜被打败了，它的兵士都不愿意打仗，许多国家要求用和平谈判解决朝鲜问题，这样美国政府就蛮横地压迫它的附庸跟着它反咬我们一口，使它的附庸国家无法反对它继续扩大侵略战争。
    工友们，美帝国主义是极端仇视我国人民得到胜利和解放的！美帝国主义是不愿我们得到和平环境来建设新中国的！美帝国主义仍旧梦想把中国变成它的殖民地，把中国人民变成它的世世代代的奴隶！它为了扩大侵略，不但强迫它在联合国的附庸通过对我国的诬蔑，并且同时又派遣著名的战争贩子杜勒斯到日本进行单独对日缔结和约和重新武装日本的阴谋活动，企图驱使日本参加美国侵略亚洲的罪恶战争。
    工友们！我们每一个人都亲身受过日本军阀奴役、污辱、压迫、屠杀的痛苦，我们经过流血牺牲八年抗战才把这些日本军阀打倒，重见天日。现在美帝国主义又企图重新武装日本来侵略我国，我们一定联合日本人民和东南亚各国人民誓死反对到底！
    工友们！我们有力量，有信心，能够粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略计划。毛主席早就说过，美帝国主义是只纸老虎。我们英勇的人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军在一起，已经一连几次把美帝国主义侵略军打得大败而逃。只要我们全中国的工人和全中国的人民在我们的英明领袖毛主席的旗帜下一致团结起来，并且和亚洲各国以及全世界的工人一致团结起来，奋斗到底，一定可以粉碎美帝国主义任何侵略阴谋！
    中华全国总工会常委扩大会议号召全国男女工友们，坚决拥护二月二日周外长的声明，继续扩大抗美援朝保家卫国运动。我们要用我们工人阶级有组织有纪律的行动，用我们的集会和示威，来抗议美国对我们伟大祖国的污辱，反对美国重新武装日本！我们要协助政府镇压美蒋反革命分子，肃清工矿企业中任何隐藏的特务分子，巩固我们自己的阵地！我们要继续开展爱国主义竞赛，把马恒昌小组竞赛运动扩大起来，坚持下去，作为我们爱国行动的经常表现！
    打倒美国侵略者！中国人民志愿军胜利万岁！我们伟大的祖国万岁！
