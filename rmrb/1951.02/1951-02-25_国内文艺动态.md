Domestic Literature and Art News

　　Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea by US imperialism, more than a dozen of our country's writers and artists have gone to Korea for interviews, including: Liu Baiyu, Kong Jue, Yuan Jing, An E, Bai Lang, Ouyang Shan, Xin Daming, Ouyang Shanzun, Yang Shuo, Song Zhidi, Bai Ai, Lou Shiyi, Xu Chi, Jing Yandun, Shu Qun, Xie Tingyu, etc. Some writers have already published works reflecting the heroic battles of the Chinese and Korean troops and the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. For example, Yang Shuo has successively published communications in the People's Daily; Lou Shiyi has published two communications, "Battlefield Driver" and "Korean People," in the Wenyi Bao and World Knowledge successively; Xu Chi has published two communications, "An Army with Ideals" and "Eyewitness Account of the Bombing of Pyongyang," in the Guangming Daily and Xin Guancha successively; An E has serialized the communication "Returning from Korea" in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily; Kong Jue and Yuan Jing have serialized the novel "Life and Death Fate" in the Northeast Daily, which has now been published as a separate book by the China Youth Publishing House.
    
　　Over the past three months, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Cultural Troupe has been conducting various literary and artistic activities in groups on the Korean battlefield. In addition to the frontline creation group following the troops to the front, several groups are distributed in five or six counties along the Cheongcheon River, and go deep into districts and townships to do mass work; several groups are distributed on transportation lines, hospitals and dressing stations, and some people go to prisoner of war camps. They have been warmly welcomed by soldiers and people everywhere. In early February, the cultural troupe's groups gathered together to hold a party, performing programs created in the past three months due to participation in practical work. Among them were the drama "Cheongcheon River Bridge," the report drama "Catching a Tongue," "Oh Mani," the dance drama "Hatred," and the drum song "Hero Tu Wenqi," etc. The content all reflects the heroic battles and friendship of the Chinese and Korean people, and exposes the atrocities of the American invading army. Korean people's leader General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Kim Tu-bong, and others attended the show. In the two dramas "Catching a Tongue" and "Oh Mani," the close relationship between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people is shown. Although they do not speak the same language, they understand each other and have a deep brotherly friendship. The performance was very effective and won unanimous praise from the audience at the party.
