　　The Beijing Market is Prospering
　　Ji Gang

　　Around seven or eight o'clock in the evening, if you travel north from Qianwai Zhushikou, passing through Wupailou, Xidan, Xisi, Dongsi, Dongdan, and then taking a turn at Wangfujing, you will see: shops and stores lining the roadside, all renovated with a fresh look. Colorful neon lights and spotlights illuminate each shop and the entire street, making them bright and radiant. Large slogans like "Oriented towards the countryside, small profits and quick turnover" are visible everywhere in front of the stores. The glass display windows are filled with a dazzling array of goods, and customers come and go in a constant stream, presenting a prosperous and thriving scene.

　　Thanks to the correct implementation of industrial and commercial policies by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, especially the unification of finance and economy and the adjustment of industry and commerce last year, Beijing's industry and commerce have begun to embark on a path of prosperity. The opening and closing of private industrial and commercial enterprises last year is the best proof. In 1950, the number of private industrial enterprises that opened increased by 3,429 compared to 1949, and private commercial enterprises increased by 715. Legitimate industries beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as mechanized flour, weaving and dyeing, ironwork, knitting, and silk fabrics, have all been restored and developed; backward industries that used to serve bureaucrats, compradors, and landlords, and those that peddled superstitious items, such as gold and silver jewelry, pawnshops, incense and candles, antiques, and precious jade, have mostly switched to other lines of work or closed down.

　　Industrial and commercial capitalists, seeing the flourishing state of their businesses now, and recalling the difficult situation in the past, truly feel a stark contrast! Therefore, they sincerely appreciate Chairman Mao's leadership. They feel that the government's industrial and commercial policies are excellent, and the government cares for private industrial and commercial enterprises with meticulous attention. Under the leadership of the government, they have overcome various difficulties, and now the business of each industry has turned from good to developed. With good business, good morale, and profits, private industrial and commercial circles have even greater enthusiasm for management.

　　After the government adjusted industry and commerce in May and June of last year, Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store held a business symposium between labor and management, changed its business strategy, and proposed "oriented towards the countryside, small profits and quick turnover," exchanging the wool and silk fabrics stored in the counter for cotton cloth. In July, business improved day by day, with an average daily turnover of more than 30 million, resulting in a profit. In the peak months of September and October, the daily turnover increased more than tenfold compared to March of the previous year. Peasants who had been emancipated accounted for four-tenths of the cloth buyers. In the off-season, sales did not decrease much, which was very different from the situation in previous years. The store, which had never advertised or decorated in the past, relied solely on the three characters "Ruifuxiang" to do business. Now, it publishes advertisements, broadcasts on the radio, distributes leaflets to major factories and government agencies, and goes to the countryside to promote sales. As a result, business has become even more expanded. Qiantai Cloth Store in Zhushikou is also like this. In September and October, it could sell 20 to 30 million yuan per day, which had never happened before. Peasants from the suburbs bought a lot of cloth to take back. Gao Shouxin, the manager of the store, said well: "After the land reform, peasants take care of our business even more. If everyone adds a piece of clothing, how much cloth will be needed? We really have to do our business well!"

　　The improvement of Beijing's industry and commerce has given many industrial and commercial capitalists confidence, and they are planning how to develop their businesses. Chen Pinzhi, director of Xingye Investment Company and general manager of Yongtaihe Steel File Factory, said: "With legitimate profits in industry and commerce, underground capital will come out. Before liberation, investors were often tricked and deceived, relying on friends' faces to take out some money, which was equivalent to 'giving' it away. Now it is different, it is investing in productive enterprises." He himself is like this. Before liberation, he did not dare to invest more. In July last year, seeing that the Yongtaihe Steel File Factory could not support itself, he saw that the factory had prospects for development, so he invested 100 million yuan and started work. The factory now produces more than 9,000 shillings per month, more than double the amount in July last year. Due to the improvement of industry and commerce, many industrial and commercial capitalists have corrected their past incorrect views and practices. Feng Jiyuan, general manager of Huaying Pharmacy, said: "In the past, merchants would ask for exorbitant prices when doing business, and they could ask customers for 100,000 yuan for something worth 10,000 yuan. Now, prices are clearly marked, and transactions are fair and reasonable, and deals are concluded amicably. This is truly a big change." The old book industry in Wailiulichang also abandoned its practice of sticking to old ways for many years. Last year, fifty or sixty old book businesses raised more than 10 million yuan and published more than twenty kinds of new novels and new ballad books to promote sales in the countryside; in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, they organized five mobile teams to promote current affairs reading materials in the countryside, factories, and government agencies, and achieved good results. They are preparing to expand their sales and distribution work on this basis.

　　Beijing's industrial and commercial capitalists hate those unscrupulous merchants who continue to engage in speculation and hoarding after liberation, believing that these unscrupulous merchants are the scum of the industrial and commercial community, affecting their interests, and strongly support the government's severe punishment of unscrupulous merchants.

　　Beijing's industrial and commercial capitalists are practicing the five patriotic covenants put forward in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. They not only want to do their own business well, but also want to consolidate and expand production, and strengthen the country's economic and defense capabilities.

### 北京市面上繁荣了

　　北京市面上繁荣了
    纪刚
    晚上七八点钟，当你从前外珠市口往北，经五牌楼、西单、西四、东四、东单到王府井绕一趟，你会看到：道旁林立着的商号、店铺都修饰得面目一新，五颜六色的霓虹灯和太阳灯，把每个店铺和整条街道照得通明火亮。商店前“面向农村，薄利多销”的大字标语，到处可见。各家玻璃橱窗里，货色琳琅满目，顾客络绎不绝，显现出一幅兴隆繁荣的气象。
    由于京市人民政府正确的执行了工商业政策，特别是去年财经统一，和调整工商业的结果，北京的工商业开始走上繁荣的道路。去年的私营工商业开歇业情况就是最好的证明。一九五○年私营工业开业的，比一九四九年增加了三千四百二十九户，私营商业增加了七百十五户。正当的有利于国计民生的行业，像机制面粉、织染、铁工、针织、绸布等业都有了恢复和发展；过去为官僚、买办、地主阶级服务和贩卖迷信品等落后行业，像金银首饰、典当、香烛、古玩、珠宝玉石等大多数都转业和停业了。
    工商资本家看到现在业务的蒸蒸日上，回想过去那种艰难的情景，真是一个鲜明的对比啊！因此，他们衷心感激毛主席的领导。他们感到：政府的工商业政策非常好，政府对于私营工商业关心得无微不至。在政府领导下，他们克服了各种困难，到现在各行业的营业由好转走向发展了，生意好，心气好，有了盈余，私营工商界经营的劲头更大了。
    瑞蚨祥绸布店在去年五六月间政府调整工商业以后，该店劳资双方开了业务座谈会，改变了经营方针，提出“面向农村、薄利多销”，把柜上所存的呢绒绸缎，折价换成了布货。七月间业务一天天好转，平均每天流水就卖到三千多万，有了盈余。九、十两个旺月，每天流水比前年三月增加了十倍多。翻身后的农民来买布的占十分之四。淡月时，销货并没减了多少，和往年情形大不相同。该店过去一向不宣传、不扎彩，就凭“瑞蚨祥”三个字做买卖，现在登广告，放广播，向各大工厂、机关印发传单，到四乡去推销，这样一来业务越见开展了。珠市口谦泰布店也是这样，九、十月份每天能卖两、三千万元，这是过去从来也没有过的事，四郊来的农民买了不少布回去，该店经理高守信说得好：“土改后，农民照顾我们这一行，可就多了，一人添一件衣裳，就要用多少布啊？我们的买卖可真得好好做啦！”
    北京工商业的情况好转，使许多工商资本家，有了信心，计划着怎样开展业务。兴业投资公司董事、永泰和钢锉厂总经理陈聘之说：“工商业有了正当利润，地下游资就出来了，解放前投资的人常常被坑受骗，靠朋友面子拿出一些钱来，结果等于‘舍’了，现在不同了，是投向生产事业了。”他自己就是这样的，解放前不敢多投资，去年七月间永泰和钢锉厂眼看支持不了，他看这厂子有发展前途，就投了一亿元而开了工。该厂现在月产九千多先令，比去年七月增加了一倍多。由于工商业好转了，许多工商资本家，端正了过去不正确的看法和作法，华英药房总经理冯季远说：“过去商人做买卖漫天要价，值一万元的东西，也能向顾客楞要十万元，现在明码交易了，买卖公平合理，和气成交，这真是个大改变。”和外琉璃厂旧书业，也放弃了多少年墨守成规的做法。去年五、六十家旧书业集资一千多万元，出版二十几种新小说、新唱本到农村去推销；在抗美援朝运动中，组织了五个流动队，到农村、工厂、机关里推销时事读物，成绩很好，他们准备以此基础扩大推销发行工作。
    北京工商资本家对那些在解放后继续从事投机倒把、囤积居奇的奸商，恨之入骨，认为这些奸商就是工商界的败类，影响他们的利益，非常拥护政府对奸商的严厉惩办。
    北京的工商资本家，正在实践着在抗美援朝运动中提出的五项爱国公约，他们不但要把自己的业务搞好，而且还要巩固和扩大生产，加强国家经济力量与国防力量。
