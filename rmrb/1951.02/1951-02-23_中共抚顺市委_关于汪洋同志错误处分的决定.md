The CCP Fushun Municipal Committee
Decision on the Erroneous Punishment of Comrade Wang Yang

Comrade Wang Yang, Director of the Machine Repair Factory, committed a serious error of principle in implementing the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers."

In July and August 1950, Comrade Lu Bo, a reporter from the *Fushun Daily*, interviewed at the Machine Repair Factory and published an article in the *People's Daily* and *Labor Daily* entitled "Let's See Why the Machine Repair Factory Always Fails to Complete its Tasks." Later, he published another article in the *People's Daily* entitled "What are the Reasons for the Many Accidents and Low Quality in the Machine Repair Factory?" These two reports had shortcomings, such as being based one-sidedly on the reflections of the workers on certain issues, which did not conform to the actual situation; listing superficial phenomena; and piling up many stimulating words and phrases while lacking concrete content. However, it is undeniable that the Machine Repair Factory had many shortcomings in production leadership in the first half of last year. Comrade Wang Yang did not respond factually in the newspapers, but adopted a completely confrontational attitude. He drafted a letter to the *Labor Daily* and the *People's Daily* himself, had the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League sign and stamp it, and stated in the letter that Lu Bo was "reversing right and wrong, confusing black and white, arousing great indignation among all the workers, while a few backward elements took the opportunity to attack the leadership." He defended his own shortcomings in many ways. In September of last year, when the Party, government, and trade union of the Machine Repair Factory held a meeting, Comrade Wang Yang lost his temper in the office and declared: "If Lu Bo (reporter from *Fushun Daily*) comes again, he must be driven out." In mid-September of last year, Wang Yang, on the grounds that Lu Bo had not gone through the factory administration and general branch when organizing a correspondent group, drafted a report to the Municipal Party Committee, the Mining Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau, claiming that Lu Bo was politically suspicious, secretly carrying out activities in the factory, violating public security laws and disrupting labor discipline, and demanded that the Municipal Party Committee and public security organs investigate. The secretary of the general branch of the Machine Repair Factory, without any principle, actually agreed to this report and issued it in the name of the general branch.

In late September 1950, a conflict occurred between Wang Yang and the security worker of the factory. Comrade Wang Yang's attitude was extremely rude (according to a worker from the construction department working next to the guardhouse, Comrade Wang Yang's mouth was full of abusive language), forcibly dragging the worker to the office. After the incident, the newspaper interviewed the security worker, who filed a complaint saying, "The factory director hit someone." The *Fushun Daily* did not clarify the facts and published it in the newspaper. The newspaper was not serious and conscientious enough, and the Municipal Party Committee criticized the newspaper after discovering this. Comrade Wang Yang again used this as a reason, with an extremely arrogant attitude, to write a letter to the newspaper, saying: "...large-character headlines, disturbing to the eye...blind reporting, full of falsehoods, which damages my personal reputation." At the same time as writing to the newspaper, he also wrote a report to the Municipal Party Committee. In this report, using the tone of the staff and workers, he greatly slandered the Party newspaper, saying in the report: "Is this newspaper run by small merchants? Why not seek truth from facts and fabricate things randomly?!" "The newspaper is fabricating on top of fabrication, does this still have the flavor of a Party newspaper!? This is just the plaything of the petty bourgeoisie's low tastes!" and "The world is so big, there is nothing that doesn't exist..." and so on. And Comrade Wang Yang actually demanded that the Municipal Party Committee publish this report publicly in the newspaper.

The Municipal Party Committee believes that Comrade Wang Yang's mistake is not accidental, but a series of errors of principle over a considerable period of time.

Comrade Wang Yang disregarded the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals," brazenly rejected criticism in newspapers, and defended and concealed his own shortcomings without principle. If Comrade Wang Yang's error were allowed to develop, it would be impossible to discover and correct shortcomings and errors in the work on the basis of criticism and self-criticism, and the work would stop moving forward.

Comrade Wang Yang's accusation that the reporter of the *Fushun Daily* was politically suspicious and his demand that the Municipal Party Committee and the Public Security Bureau investigate is an even more serious error of principle. This is a manifestation of the exploiting class's consciousness of attacking others to benefit oneself, which cannot be tolerated for a Party member.

Comrade Wang Yang developed from refusing to conduct criticism and self-criticism in the Party newspaper to opposing the Party newspaper, launching unprincipled attacks and slanders against the Party newspaper, saying that the Party newspaper "is a small merchant's newspaper" and "the plaything of the petty bourgeoisie's low tastes," and even demanding that this unprincipled slander against the Party newspaper be published in the newspaper, which completely loses the position of a Party member.

The Municipal Party Committee believes that in order to educate Comrade Wang Yang so that he can deeply recognize his mistakes, in order to consolidate Party discipline, and in order to promote the development of criticism and self-criticism, Comrade Wang Yang should be given a public warning and announced.

The Municipal Party Committee believes that, according to the nature of Comrade Wang Yang's errors, a more severe punishment should be given. However, when the Municipal Party Committee discovered Comrade Wang Yang's mistakes, it failed to educate and correct them in a timely manner, so that his mistakes gradually developed, which should be the responsibility of the Municipal Party Committee and should be reviewed. In view of the above reasons, Comrade Wang Yang's mistakes are treated leniently.

### 中共抚顺市委  关于汪洋同志错误处分的决定

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　中共抚顺市委
　  关于汪洋同志错误处分的决定
    机修厂厂长汪洋同志在执行中共中央“关于在报纸上展开批评和自我批评的决定”上，犯了严重的原则错误。
    一九五○年七、八月间，《抚顺日报》记者鲁渤同志到机修厂采访，在《人民日报》、《劳动日报》发表了《看看机修厂为什么老是完不成任务》一文，后又在《人民日报》发表了《机修厂事故多质量低的原因在那里》一文。这两篇报道是有缺点的，如在若干问题上片面的以工人的反映为根据与实际情况不符，表面现象罗列，堆集许多富于刺激性的词句，而内容不够切实等；然而不可否认的，去年上半年机修厂在生产领导上存在许多缺点，汪洋同志未实事求是的在报纸上予以答复，而采取了完全对立的态度。他自己起草给《劳动日报》和《人民日报》写信，让党、工、团都签名盖章，在信上并说：鲁渤是“颠倒是非，混淆黑白，引起全体工人之极大愤慨，而少数落后分子则乘机攻击领导”，对自己本身的缺点，则多方面加以辩护。去年九月，机修厂党、政、工开会时，汪洋同志在办公室大发脾气，声称：“鲁渤（抚顺日报记者）再来，一定要把他驱逐出去。”去年九月中旬，更以鲁渤在组织通讯员小组时，未通过该厂行政与总支为理由，汪洋同志即起草给市委、矿务局、公安局写报告，声称鲁渤有政治嫌疑，暗中在厂秘密活动，违犯治安法令及破坏劳动纪律，要求市委及公安机关追查。机修厂总支书记毫无原则，也居然同意这一报告，以总支名义发出。
    一九五○年九月下旬，汪洋与该厂之守卫工友发生冲突，汪洋同志之态度异常蛮横（据在守卫室旁工作之工友——基建处工人说，汪洋同志嘴内混有谩骂语句），强拉工人到办公室去。事情发生后，报社找守卫工友采访，工友提出控诉说：“厂长打人。”抚顺报社未弄清事实真象，即在报纸发表。报社不够严肃和认真，是有错误的，市委于发觉后即对报社进行了批评。汪洋同志又以此为理由，以极为傲慢的态度，给报社写信称：“……大字标题，扰乱视听……盲目报导，满纸虚言，实有损本人之荣誉。”给报社写信之同时，又给市委写一报告。在这一报告里，假借职工之口吻，对党报大加诬蔑，在报告中说：“这家报纸是小商人办的报吧？为什么不实事求是，胡乱捏造？！”“报纸在捏造上再加捏造，这还有党报的气味吗！？这只是小市民低劣趣味的玩意儿罢了！”以及“世界之大，无奇不有……”等等。而汪洋同志，竟还要求市委将这个报告，在报纸上公开发表。
    市委认为：汪洋同志的错误不是偶然的，而是相当长的时期内，一系列的原则错误。
    汪洋同志不顾中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，悍然拒绝报纸上的批评，对自己的缺点，无原则的加以辩护和掩盖。汪洋同志的这种错误，如果听其发展，就不能在批评与自我批评的基础上发现和纠正工作中的缺点和错误，就会使工作停止了前进。
    汪洋同志指控抚顺日报社记者有政治嫌疑，要求市委及公安局追查，这更是严重的原则错误。这是打击别人以有利于自己的剥削阶级意识的表现，对于一个党员来说，是决不能容许的。
    汪洋同志由拒绝在党报上进行批评与自我批评，发展到与党报对立，对党报进行毫无原则的攻击和诬蔑，说党报“是小  商人报”“小市民低劣趣味的玩意儿”，而且居然要求将这个对党报无原则的诬蔑在报纸上发表，这完全丧失了党员的立场。
    市委认为：为了教育汪洋同志使之深刻认识自己的错误，为了巩固党的纪律，为了推动批评与自我批评的开展，应给汪洋同志以当众警告的处分，并予公布。
    市委认为：按照汪洋同志错误的性质来说，应给予更严重的处分。然而市委在发现汪洋同志的错误时，未能及时教育纠正，以致使其错误逐渐发展，这应由市委负责，并应进行检讨。鉴于上述的原因，故对汪洋同志之错误，从宽处理。

      一九五一年一月三十一日
