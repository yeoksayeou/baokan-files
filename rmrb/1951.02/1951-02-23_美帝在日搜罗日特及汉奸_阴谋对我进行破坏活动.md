　　Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: It is learned that the Second Section (special service organ) of MacArthur's Allied Headquarters in Tokyo is actively using former Japanese invading army officer Colonel Iwasaki and Japanese special agents Kawamoto Yoshitaro, Kodama Yoshio, Takahara Aioshi, Kadoya Hiroshi, and Nabeyama Sadachika to win over major traitors from the former Wang puppet regime, such as Ren Yuandao, Chen Zhongfu, Wang Zihui, and Yang Zhonghua, to organize a so-called "Sino-Japanese Alliance." Under the guise of a so-called "Third Force," they are engaging in destructive activities against our New China. The section also has a "Beijing Team," directly headed by Nabeyama Sadachika, which uses Sino-Japanese trade merchants to collect intelligence on New China. Huang Kuiwen and Tan Yushu, two participants in this organization, opened a trading company in Kobe in November of last year as a cover and have secretly entered Hong Kong from Yokohama to conduct activities. Prior to this, Yazaki Kanshi, the former head of the Japanese special service agency in Guangzhou, had traveled between Hong Kong, Macau, and Tokyo several times in the capacity of an "Allied Headquarters" consultant to contact former members of the so-called "Sawa," "Ume," and "Matsu" special service agencies who had been in China. Under the direction of American special agents, Renegade Ren Yuandao and Renegade Chen Zhongfu also organized the "Pacific Strategic Guidance Department South China Branch" to try to recruit former soldiers and frustrated politicians from the Wang puppet regime and adopt a method of long-term entrenchment and widespread proliferation to infiltrate various parts of East and South China for activities. The U.S. imperialists' vicious special agent activities against the Chinese people are an important part of their entire invasion plan against China. After the failure of the American war of aggression against Korea, this activity has become more active and deserves serious vigilance.

　　美帝在日搜罗日特及汉奸  阴谋对我进行破坏活动
    【新华社二十二日讯】据悉，麦克阿瑟的东京盟军总部第二处（特务机关），正积极通过原日本侵华旧军人岩崎大佐及日本特务川本芳太郎、儿玉誉志夫、高原逢吉、门屋博、锅山贞亲等拉拢原汪伪时代之大汉奸任援道、陈仲孚、王子惠、杨仲华等，组织所谓“中日同盟”，在所谓“第三势力”的幌子下，从事对我新中国的破坏工作。该处内并设有“北京班”，由锅山贞亲直接主持，利用中、日间之贸易商人，进行收集新中国情报的活动。参与该组织的黄奎文、谭玉书二人业于去年十一月间，在神户以开设贸易公司作掩护，并已由横滨秘密潜入香港活动。在此以前，原日本驻广州特务机关长矢崎堪什，曾以“盟军总部”顾问身份数度往来港、澳与东京之间，联络原在华之所谓“泽”、“梅”、“松”等特务机关旧人。任逆援道、陈逆仲孚等在美特指使下，亦组织了“太平洋战略指导部华南分部”，图网罗汪伪时代之旧军人、失意政客等，采取长期埋伏、广泛蔓延的方式，潜入华东、华南各地活动。美帝国主义对中国人民的凶狠的特务活动，是对中国整个侵略计划的一个重要部分。在美国侵朝战争遭到失败后，这种活动已更趋积极，值得严重警惕。
