    Xi'an City Private Jianmin and Other Factories
    Cause Worker Deaths
    Recently, incidents of private enterprise workers in Xi'an being forced to commit suicide by capitalists have occurred continuously. This sharply exposes the violation of the common program's policy of labor-capital mutual benefit by some capitalists. The facts are as follows: (1) The capitalist of Jianmin Cotton Mill does not engage in proper management and deceives the bank into granting loans. The factory deliberately shuts down, leaving the workers with no means of livelihood. When the workers held a meeting to negotiate with the capitalist on resuming work and paying wages, the capitalist used the excuse of a phone call from Dahua Cotton Mill to lure the active worker Guo Xikun away from the meeting. Afterwards, he used various sinister means to threaten him. Guo could not bear it and committed suicide by jumping into a well on November 30th last year. (2) The capitalist of Tongfeng Flour Mill shields foreman Zhang Weiyu, Zhou Tiancun, etc.; and is extremely tyrannical towards apprentices, forcing apprentices Xia Yunxiang and Liu Zhonghou to carry large bags in the wheat warehouse, depriving them of the opportunity to learn skills. He insults worker Fei Zhongqian all day long, not even allowing him to eat his fill, and even restricting Fei Zhongqian's time to go to the toilet. Fei could not bear the abuse and attempted suicide by drinking nitric acid, but was fortunately discovered by workers and sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. (3) Yang Lianjun, the manager of the Xin Jia Zi No. 3 Towel Factory in Guoqiansi Lane, abuses the seventeen-year-old apprentice Si Hongci, calling him to get up and work as soon as it is light, and only letting him off work when the rooster crows, requiring him to work more than nineteen hours a day. Sometimes the manager's entire family of five would beat him with wooden sticks, and at night they would make the apprentice kneel in the courtyard, supporting a city wall brick on his head. The above facts all show that some capitalists are abusing workers with feudal and barbaric methods; and the trade union's education of workers is also insufficient. The trade union has not made workers consciously unite to protect labor through methods such as consultation and contract signing.
    Currently, the above issues have begun to attract the attention of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Labor Bureau. Yang Lianjun, the manager of the towel factory, has been handed over to the People's Court for handling.

    Editor's Note: Barbaric acts of persecuting workers still seriously exist in some private enterprises in Xi'an City, which completely violate the provisions of the Common Program regarding labor-capital mutual benefit and the protection of the special interests of young workers and female workers. The law should punish the lawbreakers in the cases mentioned in Geng Dingyi's letter. The Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should be familiar with the living conditions of workers and effectively lead workers to protect their interests.

    西安市私营建民等厂
    发生逼死工人事件
    最近西安市连续发生私营企业工人被资方逼迫自杀的事件，这尖锐地暴露了某些资方违犯共同纲领中的劳资两利的政策。事实如下：（一）建民纱厂资方不事正当经营，欺骗银行向其贷款。该工厂并故意停工，使工友生活无着。工人开会准备与资方进行协商开工和发给工资等问题，资方即假借大华纱厂有电话，诱骗积极工人郭锡昆离开会场。后并用各种险恶手段威胁他。郭忍受不了，于去年十一月三十日投井自杀。（二）同丰面粉厂资方包庇领班张维瑜、周天存等；对学徒则极端蛮横，强迫学徒夏云祥、刘忠厚往麦仓扛大包，剥夺他们学习技术的机会。对工友费中乾则辱骂终日，连饭也不让他吃饱，费中乾连上厕所的时间都要受到限制。费因不堪虐待，喝硝强水自杀，幸被工人发觉，送往广仁医院救治。（三）郭签寺巷新甲字三号毛巾厂经理杨廉俊，虐待十七岁学徒司鸿慈，天刚明即叫他起床工作，至鸡叫才下工，每天要他工作十九小时以上。有时经理全家五口人一齐下手用木棍打他，夜里用一块城墙砖让学徒跪在院中顶着。上述事实都说明某些资方以封建、野蛮的手段虐待工人；而工会对工人的教育也不够。工会没有使工人自觉地团结起来，用协商、订合同等方法来保护劳动。
    现上述问题已开始引起市总工会和劳动局的注意，毛巾厂经理杨廉俊，已被送交人民法院处理。

    编者按：西安市某些私营企业中还严重地存在着迫害工人的野蛮行为，这完全违犯共同纲领中关于劳资两利和保护青工女工的特殊利益的规定，对耿丁一来信中所述案件中的违法分子，应依法惩处。西安市总工会应熟悉工人的生活状况，切实领导工人保护工人的利益。
