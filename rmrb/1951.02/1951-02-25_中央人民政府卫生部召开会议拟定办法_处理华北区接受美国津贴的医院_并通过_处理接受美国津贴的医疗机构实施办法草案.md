Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd—The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government convened a meeting on handling hospitals in North China receiving US subsidies from the 12th to 16th of this month in Beijing to discuss measures for dealing with medical institutions receiving US subsidies. The meeting passed the "Draft Implementation Measures for Handling Medical Institutions Receiving US Subsidies" and consulted on specific handling measures for each hospital in North China receiving US subsidies. The representatives attending the meeting further understood that handling medical institutions receiving US subsidies is an important struggle to eliminate the cultural aggression of American imperialism, thereby strengthening unity and enhancing the patriotic enthusiasm of the hospital representatives present. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the government's policies and measures.

The meeting was attended by the presidents, board members, and union representatives of ten hospitals in North China receiving US subsidies and twelve hospitals receiving subsidies from other countries, the heads of health administrative organs from the five provinces and two cities in North China and the three major administrative regions of East China, Central South, and Southwest, as well as representatives from the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, totaling more than seventy people.

At the opening ceremony of the meeting, Li Dequan, Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, He Cheng, Deputy Minister, and Shao Quanlin, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, delivered speeches. They unanimously pointed out that handling medical institutions receiving US subsidies is an anti-imperialist and patriotic political struggle. Every patriotic employee in medical institutions receiving US subsidies should stand with the government to resolutely eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression. Deputy Minister He Cheng also announced the principles of the Ministry of Health for handling hospitals receiving US subsidies based on the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Handling Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving US Subsidies": to ensure that their operations are not affected and that their effectiveness is fully utilized to meet the medical needs of the broad masses of people, and not to reduce the scope of operations, especially to prevent the transfer, damage, and destruction of property; for hospitals taken over or jointly run by the government, all Chinese employees will be retained in their original positions and with their original salaries. Deputy Minister He also pointed out that the success of the North China meeting would provide guidance for the work of handling hospitals receiving US subsidies throughout the country.

After repeated discussions in small group meetings, individual talks, and symposiums over several days, the attending representatives recognized the appropriateness and prudence of the government's handling principles, dispelled many unnecessary concerns, and finally consulted on three handling methods for hospitals receiving US subsidies: (1) taken over by the government; (2) converted to be run by the Chinese people themselves; (3) converted to be jointly run with the government.

Deputy Minister He Cheng gave a summary of the meeting, announcing the specific handling measures for each hospital in North China receiving US subsidies, which were consulted and formulated based on the specific situation. Among the ten hospitals in North China receiving US subsidies, in addition to the Peking Union Medical College and its affiliated hospital, which have already been taken over by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the meeting suggested: (1) that the Tianjin Women and Children's Hospital, Tongxian Luhe Hospital, Changli Guangji Hospital, Taigu Renji Hospital, and Fenyang Hospital, totaling five hospitals, be taken over by the government; (2) that the Baoding Gospel Hospital be converted to be run by the Chinese people themselves; (3) that the Tongren, Daoji, and Women and Children's Hospitals in Beijing, totaling three hospitals, be converted to be jointly run with the government. The meeting also unanimously passed the "Draft Implementation Measures for Handling Medical Institutions Receiving US Subsidies" and the joint declaration of the attending representatives on the 16th. The above-mentioned methods for handling each hospital receiving US subsidies will be submitted to the Ministry of Health for approval by the Government Administration Council before implementation.

At the meeting, the representatives fully poured out their personal experiences of being oppressed for many years, and denounced the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out aggression in our country by running hospitals. They unanimously expressed satisfaction and warm support for the government's decisions and handling principles, and expressed that they would resolutely transform themselves under the leadership of the government in the future and run the hospitals better.

Before the closing of the meeting on the 16th, Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, came to the meeting and said: The great Chinese people have the strength to do everything well. Employees of hospitals that previously received US subsidies, regardless of the hospital authorities or the union, religious believers or non-religious believers, should unite under the banner of patriotism to jointly oppose our enemy—American imperialism, thoroughly eliminate the erroneous thoughts of worshipping, being close to, and fearing the United States, and completely shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism to harm the interests of the Chinese people.
