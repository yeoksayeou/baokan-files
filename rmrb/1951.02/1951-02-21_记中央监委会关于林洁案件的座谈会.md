Record of the Central Supervisory Committee's Symposium on the Lin Jie Case

After the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government published its handling of the case of Lin Jie, former manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, and others, who used their positions for personal gain in December of last year, reader Wang Jinlin and others wrote to this newspaper, believing the handling was inappropriate. After receiving the readers' letters, the Central Supervisory Committee re-studied and reviewed the case with a serious and responsible attitude, and held a reader symposium on the afternoon of January 31 to specifically discuss the handling of the Lin Jie case. This incident demonstrates that today's government is seriously responsible to the people, and the people cherish their government very much.

The symposium was personally presided over by Pan Zhenya, Deputy Director of the Central Supervisory Committee, and attended by Li Shizhang, Secretary-General of the Committee, Zhang Pengtu, Director of the General Office, Zhang Muyao, Director of the First Department, Zhang Xiuyan, Director of the Third Department, and Guo Chao, Deputy Director of the Personnel Department of the Central Ministry of Trade. The readers invited to attend were Lu Wangzhi, Chu Yuanxi, and Yu Yi. Lu Wangzhi is a housewife residing in Beijing. Chu Yuanxi is a professor at a certain engineering school in Zhangjiakou City. He represented a reading group from the school. Before he came to Beijing to participate in the symposium, their reading group held a discussion on the Lin Jie case. Yu Yi is a staff member of the Mentougou Coal Industry Branch Company. In the days before the official symposium, the Central Supervisory Committee and relevant department heads had spoken with these three readers several times to further listen to their opinions.

These eight readers who wrote to this newspaper unanimously believed that the punishment for Lin Jie was too light and could not achieve the purpose of educating the people and cadres. They believed that Lin Jie, as a higher-level person in charge of a national economic department, violated the policies and laws of the People's Government and used his position for personal gain. This was clearly an unforgivable mistake, and the Central Supervisory Committee's mere granting of two major demerits could not convince the people. Their suggestions were: Lin Jie should be given the punishment of dismissal or demotion, or dismissal and sent to the court. Lin Jie himself should publicly review his mistakes in the newspaper, and if he is a member of the Chinese Communist Party, he should also be severely punished within the Party.

After the symposium began, Zhang Muyao, Director of the First Department, first reported on the Central Supervisory Committee's handling of the Lin Jie case. He said: The Central Supervisory Committee handled the Lin Jie issue with a serious, responsible, and selfless spirit, and would never protect officials like the reactionary Kuomintang government. In the process of handling this case, the Supervisory Committee sent out several cadres, spent several months, collected materials through various means, and sent special personnel to Ding County for investigation. After repeated meetings, research and discussion, and repeated exchanges of views with relevant parties, the Supervisory Committee made the final handling plan after clarifying the facts. This shows that the Supervisory Committee did not "condone" Lin Jie or "exonerate" him in the handling of this issue. After receiving the readers' letters this time, the Supervisory Committee attached great importance to it and held three meetings to discuss it. Although the basic spirit of the Supervisory Committee's handling of this case was correct, and it was appropriate to give Lin Jie two major demerits, it was precisely because of everyone's letters that we realized that there were shortcomings in the handling of this issue, which are worth reviewing and paying attention to in the future. When the Supervisory Committee issued the handling bulletin, some factual details were not clearly explained. For example, the last paragraph of the article stated: "A net profit of 2.94 million yuan was obtained, and Zheng Daqi received 745,000 yuan...", but it did not state that the remaining 2 million yuan was distributed by private merchant Jia Ying. This fully demonstrates our carelessness in our work. Some of the wording was also inappropriate. In the future, we must be especially careful in our wording. Director Zhang also explained in detail in his report the nature of Lin Jie's mistakes and the principles of the Supervisory Committee's handling.

Following Director Zhang, the three readers spoke one after another. They unanimously expressed their deep appreciation for the serious and responsible work style of the People's Government. They agreed with the Central Supervisory Committee's punishment of Lin Jie because they had further understood the facts after listening to Director Zhang's report. Professor Chu Yuanxi said several times with great excitement: At that time, our reading group wrote a letter to the People's Daily entirely out of righteous indignation. We felt that in the era of the People's Government, things like Lin Jie's violation of laws and dereliction of duty should not happen. Our views were basically correct, but we did not understand the detailed circumstances of the case, and our understanding was inevitably a little biased. Corruption and malpractice are the legacy of the old society, and everyone hates them. But this cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. I am very happy to come to Beijing to attend this symposium. The opinions of our more than ten people have actually aroused such attention from the People's Government. This alone is enough to prove that the People's Government is essentially different from the reactionary Kuomintang government.

Those who spoke next included Director Zhang Pengtu, Secretary-General Li Shizhang, and Director Zhang Xiuyan. Director Zhang Xiuyan particularly pointed out that although Mr. Lu Wangzhi claimed to be a housewife, it was very valuable that she could care about national affairs in this way. Such a thing can only happen in the people's country. Secretary-General Li said: The Central Supervisory Committee has handled many cases in the past year, and this is the first time that the people have raised opinions on the handling results, which makes us very excited. We welcome everyone to offer more suggestions in the future and work together to improve the people's supervisory work.

Finally, Deputy Director Pan made a concluding speech at the symposium. In his speech, he made a very sincere self-criticism. He said: Although the phrase "similar to corruption" has a legal basis, it is not common enough, which has led to misunderstandings. This is what we should pay attention to in the future. The symposium came to a successful conclusion.

### 记中央监委会关于林洁案件的座谈会

　　记中央监委会关于林洁案件的座谈会
    去年十二月二十一日，中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会发表了处理前北京煤铁分公司经理林洁等利用职权营私图利的案件后，读者王金林等投书本报，认为处理不当。中央监委接到读者的来信后，以严肃认真的态度将该案重新研究审查，并于一月三十一日下午召开读者座谈会，专门讨论林洁案件的处理问题。这一件事情说明：今天的政府对人民是认真负责的，人民对自己的政府也是非常爱护的。
    座谈会由中央监委潘震亚副主任亲自主持，出席该委秘书长李世璋、办公厅主任张鹏图、第一厅厅长张慕尧、第三厅厅长张秀岩及中央贸易部人事司副司长郭超等。读者应邀出席的有陆望之、储元熹和于一。陆望之是居住北京的一位家庭妇女。储元熹是张家口市某工程学校的教授。他所代表的是该校的一个读报组。在他来京参加座谈会之前，他们的读报组曾经举行了一次关于林洁案的讨论会。于一是门头沟煤业支公司的工作人员。在正式举行座谈会的前些天，中央监委与有关部门的负责人，曾先后和这三位读者谈过几次话，进一步听取他们的意见。
    这八位投书本报的读者，一致认为林洁的处分太轻，不能达到教育人民和干部的目的。因为他们认为，林洁身为国家经济部门的较高负责人，竟违反人民政府的政策法令，利用职权营私图利。这显然是不可饶恕的错误，而中央监委仅给以两大过处分，不能使人心服。他们提出的意见是：应给林洁以撤职或降级使用的处分，或撤职送法院。林洁本人应在报上公开检讨错误，若是中共党员，并应受到党内严厉处分。
    座谈会开始后，首由第一厅厅长张慕尧报告中央监委处理林洁案件的经过。他说：中央监委是以严肃负责和大公无私的精神来处理林洁的问题，绝不会像国民党反动政府一样官官相护。监委在处理这一案件的过程中，曾派出几个干部，花费了几个月的时间，通过各种方式收集材料，并派专人到定县进行调查。经反复开会研究讨论，并和有关方面再三交换意见，直到弄清事实真象后，监委才作出了最后处理的方案。这就说明监委在这一问题的处理上，绝没有“姑息”林洁，或者为他“开脱”罪名。这一次接到读者来信后，监委非常重视，曾先后三次开会讨论。虽然监委处理这一案件的基本精神是正确的，给予林洁以记两大过的处分是恰当的；但正由于大家的来信，使我们认识到在这一问题的处理上是有缺点的，值得检讨和今后注意的。监委发布处理公报时，有些事实经过没有交待清楚，如文中最后一段说：“获纯利二百九十四万元，郑大器分得七十四万五千元……”，而未说明其余的二百多万元，由私商贾英分去。这充分表现了我们工作中的粗心大意。有些词句也用得不妥当。我们今后在用字措词上，一定要特别仔细。张厅长并在报告中，详细说明了林洁所犯错误的性质，以及监委处理的原则。
    继张厅长之后，三位读者先后发言。他们一致表示，深为人民政府此种认真负责的作风所感动。他们同意中央监委给予林洁的处分，因为听了张厅长的报告后，已进一步了解事实真象。储元熹教授曾经几次很兴奋的说：当时我们读报小组给人民日报写信，完全是出于义愤。我们觉得在人民政府的时代，不应该发生像林洁这样违法失职的事情。我们的看法基本上是正确的，不过不了解案件的详细情形，认识上不免有一点偏激。贪污舞弊是旧社会的遗毒，人人痛恨。但这不是短时期内能够全部消灭的。这次来京出席座谈会，感到十分高兴，我们十多个人的意见，居然引起了人民政府这样的重视。仅仅这件事情就足以证明：人民政府与反动的国民党政府，是有本质的区别的。
    接着发言的有张鹏图主任，李世璋秘书长和张秀岩厅长等。张秀岩厅长特别指出，陆望之先生虽自称是家庭妇女，但是能够这样关心国家大事，是非常宝贵的。像这样的事情，只有在人民的国家里才有可能出现。李秘书长说：一年来中央监委曾经处理了许多案件，人民对于处理结果提出意见的，这还是第一次，使我们非常兴奋。我们欢迎大家今后多提意见，共同把人民的监察工作作好。
    座谈会最后由潘副主任作总结发言。他在发言中，十分诚恳地作了自我检讨。他说：“形同贪污”四字，虽在法律上有根据，但因不够通俗，以致使人发生误会。这是我们今后应注意的。座谈会至此，遂圆满结束。
