　　Steadily Carry Out Farm Tool Work
    Sun Jinglu, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Administration Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    In the past year, thanks to the importance attached to farm tool work by the leadership and the efforts of all comrades engaged in this work, significant achievements have been made. In terms of supplementing existing old-fashioned farm tools, the state issued a large amount of loans, which were managed independently by each province and solved the problem of supplementing old farm tools through cooperatives, blacksmith shops, and carpentry shops. According to statistics from five provinces in North China, a total of 1,908,000 pieces of various farming and hand tools were added in 1950. According to incomplete statistics from 37 counties including Yangcheng, Fenyang, and Yuci in Shanxi Province, farmers repaired and replaced a total of 555,553 pieces of large and small farm tools themselves. According to statistics from 77 counties in Shanxi, a total of 89,622 pieces of farm tools were supplemented with loan support. In Pingyuan Province, 89,544 pieces of large and small old farm tools were added in March and April of 1950. These supplements and repairs of old farm tools played a certain role in completing the 1950 production increase task.

    In terms of promoting new-style farm tools, according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, 44 demonstration and promotion stations for new-style farm tools were established in North China, Northwest China, East China, and Central South China, and more than 12,000 pieces of new-style farm tools were distributed and promoted. The Northeast People's Government assisted mutual aid groups in various regions to establish 39 Soviet complete sets of horse-drawn farm tool trial groups, lending out a total of 3,361 pieces of farm tools. At the same time, it also focused on promoting 47,561 new farm tools (including shoveling machines, scarifiers, and large and small paddy field plows). The Northwest Region purchased more than 30 kinds of suitable Soviet new-style farm tools from Xinjiang, used the masses' livestock to cultivate land for the masses, and used Soviet self-propelled wheat harvesters for wheat harvesting demonstrations.

    In terms of talent training, in addition to the existing Jinling University Agricultural Engineering College, agricultural machinery departments were newly established in the Agricultural University and Shenyang Agricultural College, and Nanjing University also expanded its agricultural engineering department. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government established an agricultural machinery specialized school, which has trained 42 specialized talents and distributed them to work in various provinces and regions, and held four training courses for new-style farm tool technicians, training a total of 138 students, who have been distributed to work in farm tool stations in various provinces. The number of grassroots cadres trained by the provinces themselves is even greater.

    From the work of this year, we feel that we have the following gains: (1) The implementation of the people's government's policy of guaranteeing private ownership in the supplementation of old-style farm tools has eliminated the masses' concerns about repairing and replacing farm tools, and played a certain role in ensuring the completion of the 1950 production increase task. (2) The design of new-style farm tools has been carried out based on the needs of farmers and the actual conditions of rural areas. For example, the design of a series of walking plows from iron-wheeled 7-inch to wood-wheeled 7-inch, 5-inch, 166 sticky soil, and double-sided plowing, as well as a series of shoveling machines such as the Hejiang, Fumin, Lianhe, and Zonghe models, all show that farm tool design work has begun to face the masses. (3) In the manufacture of new-style farm tools, the transition from crude and shoddy production has gradually transitioned to the adoption of scientific production methods. For example, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory overcame various difficulties, brought into play the wisdom of workers and technicians, and solved several relatively important problems in farm tool manufacturing such as hemp steel and cold casting. After summarizing the work in 1950, all farm tool factories adopted a policy of steady development and put forward the slogans of strengthening specification identification, product inspection, and striving for high-quality and low-priced products. (4) In the promotion of new farm tools, various regions have created a set of working methods. First, master the typical, create experience, combine with mass organizations, carry out work with key points through labor models and activists, and actively strive for the local leading organs to attach importance to and support farm tool work. Some areas also used mass gatherings such as temple fairs and mule and horse fairs to carry out propaganda and demonstration work for new farm tools. (5) Strengthen the unity and contact of technicians in various regions, and many technicians have begun to humbly learn from farmers and from the great working class.

    At the same time, in the work of the year, we also found many shortcomings and errors. First, regarding farm tool design and manufacturing, due to our lack of knowledge of new-style farm tools, low technical level, unfamiliarity with rural conditions, limitations of equipment and materials, and lack of experience in factory management, the cost of manufactured farm tools was too high, the quality was not up to standard, or the structure was not up to specifications, and the distribution was not timely enough. Second, in the demonstration and promotion of new-style farm tools, the phenomenon that some places that need farm tools cannot get farm tools is produced because some farm tool stations do not select the location appropriately, some working cadres do not grasp the technology sufficiently, or they do not have enough understanding of this new work. In addition, some areas have not carried out publicity from the comparative experiments of the effectiveness of new and old farm tools to improve farmers' understanding. Third, regarding the supplementation of old-style farm tools, the leading organs in some areas did not take the initiative to control it, resulting in the failure of farm tool loans to be used for special purposes, and the supplementation work formed a kind of laissez-faire phenomenon.

    The guiding principle for farm tool work in 1951 was formulated under the general guiding principle of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to complete the 1951 grain, cotton, and special product production increase plan, that is, to promote the masses to restore and increase the repair of existing farm tools in rural areas, and to focus on demonstrating and promoting new-style farm tools.

    The determination of this guiding principle is mainly due to the fact that the lack of existing old farm tools in rural areas across the country is quite serious due to years of war and the destruction of the Kuomintang bandits. For example, in Henan Province last year, there were a total of 2,025,606 old plows, and the total number of farm households was 6,879,939, with an average of 0.29 plows per farm household. According to the survey of 49 typical villages in 16 counties in Shandong Province, there was a shortage of 14 percent of plows, 20 percent of harrows, and 10 percent of seeders last year. Therefore, the old-style farm tools in the country must be supplemented in a planned way in 1951. In terms of the methods of supplementing and repairing old farm tools, it should be: (1) In principle, take the county as the unit, and organize and promote this work extensively but with emphasis and planning according to the different conditions of each county. (2) Through local cooperatives, trading companies, native product companies, and support small handicraft workers, blacksmith shops, carpentry shops, private merchants, etc. to manufacture farm tools for the masses in large quantities. (3) All regions should pay attention to cultivating labor models and activists in blacksmith shops and carpentry shops who produce farm tools, and take the lead in carrying out work. In terms of supplementing the types of existing farm tools, the focus should be on the needs of production in each season and the farm tools that the masses feel most lacking, such as plowshares, plow wings, harrows, hoes, and adzes. In terms of supplementing areas, the focus should be on areas with inconvenient transportation and lack of farm tools, as well as disaster areas and new areas, and carry out work step by step.

    In terms of promoting new-style farm tools, we must currently carry out demonstration and promotion work in a focused and steady manner. And reward good farm tools created and invented by the masses after evaluation. The focus of new farm tool work: In terms of manufacturing types, plows should be the main focus, because new-style plows can deeply cultivate to increase production, prevent and control diseases, insect pests, and drought, and are cheaper, less complex in structure, and especially needed by farmers. The focus of promotion areas is on areas with convenient transportation, special product areas (such as cotton areas and tobacco areas), and areas where work has been carried out more successfully last year and where there is a good foundation for mutual aid organizations.

    Regarding the use of funds: Farm tool loans should be planned, focused, and used for special purposes, because state loans have a certain limit, and we cannot simply rely on loans to solve all problems. All regions must use loans as a medium, and should vigorously organize and use the capital of the masses to solve the problem of lack of funds locally. In the promotion of new farm tools, we should establish the idea of enterprise management. In order to realize enterprise management, all regions must study business diligently, actively plan business, and formulate methods for lending and renting new farm tools according to specific circumstances, shorten the loan period, and reward cash purchases, in order to accelerate the turnover of funds, so that a fixed amount of money can play several times the role. This is an important key to carrying out farm tool work, and it is worth noting by every comrade engaged in farm tool work.

    Regarding the design, manufacture, and inspection of new-style farm tools, we must pay full attention. In principle, in 1951, no new factories will be built for the manufacture of new-style farm tools, and no old factories will be expanded. On the existing basis, new farm tools that are high-quality, low-priced, and welcomed by the masses will be manufactured steadily. Strengthen the design and research work of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and help all regions solve technical problems related to farm tool design and manufacturing, so as to support factories in various regions, so that they can obtain materials locally, manufacture locally, and promote locally. For good farm tools that have been shaped, such as plows, standard specifications for materials, parts, and manufacturing technology must be formulated. All farm tools officially manufactured in various regions must undergo regional inspection and testing to prove that they are indeed welcomed by the masses. At the same time, the test results shall be submitted to the local administrative region for review and verification, and manufacturing shall only be permitted if the farm tool factory has the manufacturing capacity. In order to ensure timely supply, it is necessary to frequently contact farm tool stations in various regions, and formulate accurate production plans according to their needs and in accordance with the farming season.

    Regarding the design of farm tools, it should be based on the conditions of rural China, so that farm tools meet the needs of farmers. At the same time, regional experimental stations should be established in various typical areas to investigate farm tool conditions locally. According to needs, new farm tools should be designed by various design agencies and distributed to various experimental stations for inspection and comparative experiments. After confirming their use value, they will be demonstrated and promoted on a small scale. After the demonstration and promotion, it is indeed proved that the designed new-style farm tools are suitable for the needs of local farmers, and then they will be promoted on a large scale. This year, the focus of design research in various regions is on plows, cultivators, and seeders.

　　稳步地开展农具工作
    中央人民政府农业部农政司副司长  孙景鲁
    农具工作在过去一年中，由于领导上的重视和从事这件工作的全体同志的努力，收获了显著的成绩。在原有旧式农具的增补方面，国家发放了大批贷款，此项贷款均由各省自行掌握，通过合作社、铁匠炉、木工铺，解决了旧农具的补充问题。据华北五省的统计，一九五○年共增补各种耕种及手用农具一、九○八、○○○件，以山西省阳城、汾阳、榆次等三十七县的不完全统计，农民自行修置大小农具共五五五、五五三件，又据山西七十七县的统计，以贷款扶持增补农具的数目共八九、六二二件；平原省在一九五○年三四月份，即增补大小旧农具八九、五四四件。这些旧农具的增补与修理，在完成一九五○年增产任务上，是起了一定作用的。
    在推广新式农具方面，根据苏联先进的经验，华北、西北、华东、中南等区成立了示范推广新式农具站四十四个，配发与推广新式农具达一万二千多件；东北区人民政府协助各地互助组成立了三十九个苏联成套马拉农具试用组，共贷出农具三、三六一件，同时又有重点的推广新农具四七、五六一台（包括铲趟机、耲耙、大小水田洋犁）。西北区自新疆采购合用的苏联新式农具三十余种，利用群众的牲口为群众代耕，并利用苏联自拨割麦机进行割麦示范。
    在人才训练方面，除原有金陵大学农业工程专修科外，农业大学和沈阳农学院新成立了农业机械系，南京大学也扩大了农业工程系，中央农业部成立了农业机械专科学校，已经训练专门人才四十二人，分发各省区工作，并举办四期新式农具技术人员训练班，共训练学员一三八名，已分发各省农具站工作。而各省自行训练的乡村基层干部，为数更多。
    从这一年的工作中我们觉得有以下收获：（一）旧式农具增补方面贯彻了人民政府的保障私有政策，消除了群众修置农具的顾虑，在保证完成一九五○年增产任务上，起了一定的作用。（二）根据农民需要和农村实际情况进行了新式农具的设计工作。如由铁辕七英寸到木辕七英寸、五英寸，一六六粘土，两面翻土等一系列步犁的设计，由合江号到福民号、联合号、综合号等一系列铲趟机等设计工作，都说明农具设计工作已开始面向群众。（三）新式农具制造方面，由粗制滥造，逐渐的过渡到采用科学的生产方法。如华北农业机械总厂克服了各种困难，发挥了工人和技术人员的智慧，解决了麻钢和冷铸等农具制造上几个比较重要的问题。各农具工厂在总结了一九五○年工作后，都采取了稳步发展的方针，提出了加强规格鉴定、成品检查，为产品物美价廉而斗争的口号。（四）在新农具推广方面，各地均创造出一套工作方法。首先掌握典型，创造经验，结合群众组织，通过劳动模范和积极分子，有重点的开展工作，并主动的争取当地领导机关对农具工作的重视和扶持。有些地区并利用庙会、骡马会等群众性集会，进行新农具的宣传和示范工作。（五）加强各地技术人员的团结和联系，许多技术人员并开始虚心向农民学习，向伟大的工人阶级学习。
    同时在一年的工作中，我们也发现了很多缺点和错误。第一，关于农具设计制造方面，由于我们对新式农具的知识不够，技术水平低，农村情况不熟悉，设备材料的限制，以及工厂管理的缺乏经验，致使制造的农具成本太高，质量不够标准，或构造不合规格，分配不够及时。第二，新式农具示范推广方面，由于有些农具站选择的地点不尽适当，有些工作干部技术掌握不够，或对于这一新的工作认识不够，所以在推广工作方面，产生有些需要农具的地方，反而得不到农具的现象。另外，有些地区没有从新旧农具的效能比较试验上进行宣传，来提高农民的认识。第三，关于旧式农具增补工作方面，有些地区的领导机关没有主动地掌握，致使农具贷款未能专款专用，增补工作形成一种自流现象。
    一九五一年农具工作的方针，是在中央人民政府农业部贯彻完成一九五一年粮、棉和特产增产计划的总方针之下拟定的，即以推动群众恢复和增修农村原有农具为主，并有重点的示范推广新式农具。
    这个方针的确定，主要原因是由于连年战争及国民党匪帮的破坏，全国农村中原有旧农具的缺乏情况是相当严重的。如去年河南省全省共有旧犁二、○二五、六○六件，农户总数为六、八七九、九三九户，每一农户有犁的平均数为○·二九。又据山东省十六县四十九个典型村的调查，去年缺犁百分之十四，缺耙百分之二十，缺耧百分之十。因此，一九五一年全国旧式农具是须要有计划的加以补充的。在旧农具增补与修理的方式上，应该：（一）原则上以县为单位，根据各县不同情况，广泛地但又是有重点有计划地组织和推动此一工作。（二）通过当地合作社，贸易公司，土产公司，扶助小手工业者、铁匠炉、木工铺、私商等大量为群众制造农具。（三）各地应注意培养铁匠炉、木工铺中生产农具的劳动模范和积极分子，带头开展工作。在增补原有农具的种类方面，应以各个季节中生产上的需要与群众中最感缺乏的农具为重点，如犁铧、犁壁、耙、锄、镢为主。以增补地区言，应以交通不方便和农具缺乏的地区以及灾区、新区为重点，有步骤地来开展工作。
    在推广新式农具方面，目前必须是有重点的、稳步的进行示范推广工作。并奖励经评定后群众中创造和发明的好农具。新农具工作的重点：在制造种类方面，应以犁为主，因新式犁能深耕增产，防治病虫旱害，价格较廉，构造亦不复杂，而农民又特别需要。推广地区，着重在交通方便、特产区（如棉区、烟区）以及去年开展工作较有成绩和互助组织基础较好的地区。
    关于资金运用方面：农具贷款应有计划地有重点地专款专用，因为国家贷款有一定限度，不能单纯依靠贷款解决全部问题，各地必须利用贷款作为一种媒介，应大力组织和利用群众中的资本，就地解决资金缺乏问题。在新农具推广方面，应当树立起企业化经营的思想。为了实现企业化的经营，各地必须钻研业务，主动计划业务，根据具体情况，制定出贷出租新农具的办法，缩短贷期，奖励现款购买，以期加速资金周转，使定量的钱，发挥几倍的作用，这是开展农具工作的重要关键，值得每一个从事农具工作同志的注意。
    关于新式农具的制造设计检定问题，我们必须充分重视。一九五一年新式农具制造方面，原则上不增建新厂，不扩充旧厂，在现有的基础上，稳步地制造物美价廉已为群众欢迎的新农具。加强华北农业机械总厂的设计研究工作，帮助各地解决有关农具设计制造等技术问题，以便扶植各地区工厂，使其能就地取材，就地制造，就地推广。对于已成型的好农具，如犁，须制定材料、零件和制造技术的标准规格。凡各地正式制造的农具，必须经过区域性检定试验，证明其确为群众欢迎。同时将试验结果呈报当地大行政区审查、核定，而农具厂又有制造能力时，始准制造。为了保证及时供应，必须经常联系各地农具站，根据其需要情况，依照农时，制定准确的生产计划。
    关于农具的设计方面，应根据中国农村情况，务使农具切合农民需要，同时在各典型地区建立区域试验站，就地调查有关农具情况，根据需要，由各设计机关设计新农具，分发各试验站作检定比较试验。在肯定其使用价值后，再作小规模的示范推广。经过示范推广后，确实证明设计的新式农具适合于当地农民的需要时，才大量推广。今年各地的设计研究重点是犁、中耕器和播种机。
