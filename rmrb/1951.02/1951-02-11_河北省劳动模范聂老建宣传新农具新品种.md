    Hebei Province Labor Model Nie Laojian
　  Promotes New Agricultural Tools and New Varieties
    Nie Laojian, a labor model from Fangzhuang Village, Sixth District, Tang County, Hebei Province, resolved to improve the village's production after returning from the provincial labor model conference last year. He took the sprayer, medicine, and fertilizer powder that the province awarded him to the civil school for everyone to see and introduced new agricultural tools and improved varieties, such as Huanong No. 4 millet, Shengli No. 100 Chinese yam, and crooked-neck yellow sorghum. One day, when farmer Nie Junshang from the village had a celebratory event at home, Nie Laojian talked about production at the banquet. He also introduced the pamphlets on preventing and controlling diseases and pests and improving technology, which were given to him at the labor model conference, to those who could read. Many people were very interested after reading them. Farmer Liu Fuquan said, "I used to not believe that growing crops required guidance, but now it seems that to have a good life, one must be taught." While promoting superior varieties and new agricultural tools, Nie Laojian also actively led the entire village in winter manure accumulation, proposing: "Without large piles of soil, there will be no large piles of manure; without large piles of manure, there will be no large piles of grain." Now the entire village has accumulated 5,458 cartloads of manure, 1,786 cartloads more than in previous winters.

    河北省劳动模范聂老建
　  宣传新农具新品种
    河北唐县六区房庄村劳动模范聂老建，去年参加了省劳动模范大会回来以后就下决心要把全村生产搞好。他把省里奖给他的喷雾器、药品、肥田粉都拿到民校里让大家看，并向大家介绍了新式农具和优良品种——华农四号谷、胜利百号山药、歪脖黄高粱等。有一天本村农民聂俊尚家里办喜事，聂老建就在酒席上讲生产。他还把劳动模范大会赠给他的防除病虫害、改良技术的小册子，介绍给认识字的人看，很多人看了以后，都觉得很有兴趣。农民刘福全说：“以前我就不相信种庄稼要有人指点，现在看来，要过好光景就得有人教。”聂老建一方面宣传优良品种和新农具，同时又积极的领导了全村的冬季积肥，提出：“没有大堆土，就没有大堆粪，没有大堆粪，就换不了大堆粮。”现在全村已积肥五四五八车，较往年冬多积肥一七八六车。
