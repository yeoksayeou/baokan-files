　　The Taiwan People's "February 28th" Uprising Introduction
    Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters
    The Taiwan People's Uprising of February 28, 1947, was a just action by the Taiwanese people to resist the traitorous and dictatorial rule of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
    Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Taiwanese people are Chinese people. For fifty years, the Taiwanese people suffered under the cruel colonial rule of Japanese imperialism. To resist aggression and fight for freedom, the Taiwanese people persisted in their struggle for fifty years. In this long and arduous struggle, the Taiwanese people made extremely significant sacrifices; but the Taiwanese people never yielded. On the contrary, the Taiwanese people's patriotic spirit grew stronger in the forging of fire and blood. In 1945, Japan surrendered. According to the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Yalta Agreement, and other provisions concerning Japan's surrender, Taiwan was returned to China. The Taiwanese people were overjoyed to return to the motherland and were determined to work with the people of the entire country to build a prosperous and happy new China. However, after Japan's surrender, American imperialism, on the one hand, helped its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to take over Taiwan, establishing a brutal and reactionary regime in Taiwan, oppressing and exploiting the Taiwanese people; on the other hand, it directly used various despicable means to invade Taiwan—plundering Taiwan's economy and various special privileges, and sending military personnel and diplomatic secret agents to run rampant in Taiwan. The Taiwanese people harbored great ideals; witnessing the facts of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, selling out the country and harming the people, and suffering all kinds of violent and unreasonable oppression and exploitation; the Taiwanese people clearly recognized that American imperialism and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek were the deadly enemies of the Taiwanese people. Therefore, the Taiwanese people naturally developed an irreconcilable hatred for the enemy, and launched sharp mass struggles against the enemy everywhere.
    On February 27, 1947, the smuggling investigation personnel of the Chiang bandit government's Monopoly Bureau in Taipei City injured a female peddler, Lin Jiangmai, and shot and killed one of the onlookers. At that time, the people of Taipei City gathered to petition the puppet police station and the military police regiment, demanding punishment for the murderers, but to no avail; the next day, namely "February 28th," the people again petitioned the puppet Chief Executive's Office, and several more people were killed by the Chiang bandit army. At this point, the Taiwanese people could no longer endure it, the conflict expanded, and the people occupied the radio station and called on the people of the entire province to rise up in resistance. The people of the entire province responded one after another, launching a major uprising. The anger accumulated in the hearts of the people for more than a year, once it erupted, formed a large-scale struggle.
    The "February 28th" Uprising fully demonstrated the patriotic spirit of the Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people's uprising was to oppose the traitorous policies of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, to oppose the bloody fascist rule, and to build a prosperous and democratic China. The enraged Taiwanese people punished some of the big and small lackeys who colluded with the reactionaries to oppress the people, but protected the upright and kind mainland compatriots and welcomed cooperation. Although the Taiwanese people were in a chaotic situation, they knew very clearly that in order to defeat the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they must work together with the people of the whole country to achieve their common goal. Here, it should be particularly mentioned that the insidious but unlucky American imperialist spy agency—the American Information Service, etc.'s secret agents and their lackeys, the pro-American faction, fantasized about using the passion of the masses and the chaotic situation of the incident to deceive the people and create an excuse to invade Taiwan, trying every means and using all kinds of despicable methods to instigate and lure people everywhere, even mingling into the ranks of the masses to howl and shout; however, they failed shamefully. In the face of the Taiwanese people with a firm patriotic stand, they could not display their tricks.
    The "February 28th" Uprising also vividly demonstrated the solidarity and heroic fighting spirit of the Taiwanese people. At that time, the enemy in Taiwan was relatively strong. The Taiwanese people, empty-handed, seized weapons to arm themselves, repeatedly attacked, and grew stronger in continuous victories, quickly taking over the enemy's political organs, warehouses, enterprises, railways, telecommunications, radio stations...etc., capturing the enemy and forcing the enemy to surrender and disarm; in some enemy strongholds, they fought defensive battles with the enemy; and mobilized the broad masses of the people to organize various organs and armed forces to defend the local area. The Taiwanese people achieved certain results in fighting the enemy without weapons or with only a few small weapons: for example, the armed forces of the people of Chiayi captured the largest Hongmaobei armory of the bandits in Taiwan; the armed forces of the people of Taichung retreated into Puli and once repelled the pursuit of the bandit army; Keelung, Kaohsiung and other places also launched bloody battles with the enemy, showing the heroic spirit of advancing wave upon wave and not fearing bloodshed and sacrifice everywhere. At the same time, in the struggle, women in Taichung, Chiayi and other places also organized to supply food to the people's armed forces and assist in logistics.
    Although the "February 28th" Uprising was fighting alone behind enemy lines, the Taiwanese people were not isolated and helpless. The people of the whole country extended their deep sympathy to the struggle of the Taiwanese people; the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, representing the will of the people of the whole country, immediately broadcast to Taiwan from the Yan'an Radio, giving support and instructions. Although the Taiwanese people did not receive this broadcast in time to serve as a guideline for improving and strengthening the fighting force, this will forever be engraved in the hearts of the Taiwanese people, greatly enhancing the Taiwanese people's love for the motherland and their determination to fight together with the people of the whole country against American imperialism and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, making the Taiwanese people more deeply aware that only by working together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, can complete victory be achieved.
    After "February 28th," American imperialism further intensified and openly invaded Taiwan. On the one hand, American imperialism more actively helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang than before, providing military and economic assistance, equipping and training the Chiang bandit army, and slaughtering and oppressing the Taiwanese people. What is particularly infuriating in this regard is that American imperialism has actually reinstated the executioners who slaughtered the Taiwanese people, such as former Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan Kiyoshi Hasegawa and former President of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Company Yoshisuke Aikawa, to come to Taiwan to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang slaughter the Taiwanese people and oppose the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. On the other hand, the US air and naval forces have occupied many bases in Taiwan, and US monopoly capital has controlled Taiwan's major enterprises, manipulating Taiwan's economic lifeline, turning Taiwan into its colony, and using it as a military base for invading mainland China and various countries in the Far East and opposing the Soviet Union. Therefore, American imperialism has more blatantly carried out various vicious political conspiracies in Taiwan, and American diplomats have openly come forward more than once to advocate the so-called "separation movement"; and, after the failure of various indirect and hidden forms of aggression, on June 27 last year, it openly dispatched the Seventh Fleet and the 13th Air Force to invade and occupy our Taiwan.
    In the past four years, the blood debts of American imperialism and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, have been accumulating more and more, and the Taiwanese people are in dire straits. However, the Taiwanese people will never yield. The Taiwanese people have always persisted in their struggle, and their fighting strength has been developing day and night.
    The Taiwanese people have broken the so-called "separation movement" and the conspiracy to invade Taiwan by the American imperialist and its lackeys the "trusteeship faction", the "independence faction" etc. many times, and will continue to thoroughly smash them.
    The Taiwanese people have unremittingly opposed the reactionary rule of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in various ways, and have struck and will continue to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's traitorous and oppressive policies anytime and anywhere.
    Undoubtedly, the struggle of the Taiwanese people is arduous, but the Taiwanese people will persist in the struggle victoriously, regardless of sacrifice. No matter the armed aggression of American imperialism, nor the bloody rule of the American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, can absolutely conquer the patriotic Taiwanese people, and even more cannot long prevent the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Taiwanese people are fighting with the support of the people of the world. The Taiwanese people are determined, and have the confidence, to work together with the people of the whole country to defeat American imperialist aggression and liberate our sacred territory—Taiwan—from the hands of the invaders.

　　台湾人民“二·二八”起义介绍
    台湾民主自治同盟总部
    一九四七年二月二十八日的台湾人民起义，是台湾人民反抗美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮卖国独裁统治的正义行动。
    台湾是中国的领土，台湾人民是中国人民。台湾人民在五十年间受尽了日本帝国主义残酷的殖民统治，为了反抗侵略，争取自由，台湾人民曾坚持了五十年的斗争。在长期的艰苦斗争中，台湾人民付出了极其重大的牺牲；但台湾人民并没有屈服过；相反的，台湾人民的爱国主义精神，在火与血的锻炼中愈加坚强起来。一九四五年日本投降，根据开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔达协定以及其他有关日本投降条款的规定，台湾归还了中国。台湾人民欢欣若狂地欢迎重归祖国，并且决心与全国人民一起来建设富强康乐的新中国。但是，在日本投降以后，美帝即一方面帮助其走狗蒋介石匪帮接收台湾，在台湾建立了残暴无比的反动政权，压迫和剥削台湾人民；另一方面，又直接以各种卑鄙的手段侵略台湾——掠夺台湾的经济和各种特权，派遣军事人员和外交特务在台湾横行不法。台湾人民心怀着伟大的理想；目睹着美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮卖国残民的事实，身受着种种暴戾无理的压迫和剥削；台湾人民明白认识了美帝及其走狗蒋介石是台湾人民的死敌，因此，台湾人民自然而然地发生了对于敌人的不可调和的仇恨，到处对敌人展开了尖锐的群众性的斗争。
    一九四七年二月二十七日，蒋匪政府专卖局的缉私人员在台北市打伤了女小贩林江迈，并开枪打死了围观群众一人，当时台北市人民聚集向伪警察局和宪兵团请愿，要求惩办杀人凶犯，竟不得结果；次日，即“二·二八”，人民又向伪行政长官公署请愿，又被蒋匪军杀死了数人。至此，台湾人民忍无可忍，冲突扩大，人民便占领了电台，号召全省人民起来反抗。全省人民随即纷纷响应，大举起义，一年多来人民心中郁积的怒火，一旦爆发，形成了大规模的斗争。
    “二·二八”起义充分表现了台湾人民的爱国主义精神。台湾人民的起义，是为了反对美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮的卖国政策，反对血腥的法西斯统治，为了要建设富强、民主的中国。愤起的台湾人民惩罚了一些勾结反动派欺压人民的大小喽啰，但对于正直的和善良的外省同胞则予以保护，欢迎合作。台湾人民虽然在混乱情况中，还是知道得很清楚，他们要打倒美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮，必须和全国人民一起才能实现共同的目的。在这里，应当特别提起的，是阴险的但是倒楣的美帝国主义间谍机关——美国新闻处等的特务人员及其走狗亲美派，他们幻想利用群众的激情和事变的混乱情况，欺骗人民，造成侵略台湾的借口，千方百计万般卑鄙地到处煽惑、引诱，甚至混入群众队伍呼啸、叫嚣；然而他们可耻地失败了，在有爱国主义坚定立场的台湾人民面前，他们是无所施其鬾魉的。
    “二·二八”起义也生动地证明了台湾人民的团结力量和英勇的战斗精神。当时在台湾的敌人，力量是相对强大的。台湾人民赤手空拳，夺取武器武装自己，反复进攻，在不断胜利中壮大起来，迅速地接管了敌人的政权机关、仓库、企业、铁道、电信、电台、报馆……等等，俘掳敌人，迫使敌人投降缴械；在一些敌人据点则与敌人作攻防战；并且发动广大人民，组织了保卫地方的各种机关和武装部队。台湾人民在没有武器或只有很少小型武器的情况下，与敌人作战取得一定的战绩：如嘉义人民武装攻下了匪方在台最大的红毛碑军械库；台中人民武装退入埔里后，一度击退了匪军的追击；基隆、高雄等地亦与敌人展开血战，处处表现了前仆后继不怕流血牺牲的英雄气概。同时在斗争中，台中、嘉义等地的妇女也组织起来，为人民武装部队供应伙食，协助后勤。
    “二·二八”起义虽然是在敌后孤军奋斗，但台湾人民并不是孤立无援的。全国人民对台湾人民的斗争寄以深切的同情；中共中央代表全国人民的意志，即时由陕北电台对台湾广播，给予支持和指示。当时台湾人民虽然没有及时收到这个广播，来作为改善和加强斗争力量的方针，但这将永远铭志在台湾人民心里，大大地增强了台湾人民对祖国的热爱，和与全国人民在一起为反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮而斗争的决心，使台湾人民更深刻认识：只有与全国人民一起，在中国共产党领导下，才能取得完全的胜利。
    “二·二八”之后，美帝国主义更进一步地加紧和公开侵略台湾。一方面，美帝国主义较前更加积极地帮助蒋介石匪帮，给予军事的、经济的援助，装备并训练蒋匪军，屠杀和压迫台湾人民。在这一方面特别令人发指的是：美帝国主义竟起用屠杀台湾人民的刽子手，前日本驻台湾总督长谷川清及前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介等前来台湾，帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀台湾人民，反对中国人民解放台湾。另一方面，美国海空军在台湾占据了许多基地，美国独占资本则控制了台湾的主要企业，操纵台湾的经济命脉，把台湾变成了它的殖民地，作为侵略中国大陆和远东各国以及反对苏联的军事基地。因此，美帝国主义更加露骨地在台湾进行了各种恶毒的政治阴谋，美国外交人员竟不止一次地公然出面鼓吹所谓“分离运动”；而且，在各种间接的隐蔽的侵略方式破产之后，于去年六月二十七日公然派遣第七舰队及第十三航空队侵占我台湾。
    四年来，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的血债是愈积愈多了，台湾人民正在水深火热之中。然而，台湾人民是永远不屈服的。台湾人民永远坚持斗争，而且其斗争力量日日夜夜地发展起来。
    台湾人民许多次地打破了美帝国主义及其走狗“托管派”、“独立派”等的所谓“分离运动”和侵略台湾的阴谋，并且将继续予以彻底粉碎。
    台湾人民坚持不懈地以各种方式来反对美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，随时随地的打击了、而且还将继续打击蒋介石匪帮的卖国残民政策。
    无可疑义，台湾人民的斗争是艰苦的，但台湾人民是会不顾牺牲，胜利地来坚持斗争的。不管美帝国主义的武装侵略，也不管美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮的血腥统治，绝对无法征服爱国的台湾人民，更加不能长久阻止强大中国人民解放军解放台湾。今天，台湾人民在中国共产党的领导下，在全世界人民的声援中进行斗争。台湾人民有决心，而且有信心，和全国人民一起，打败美帝国主义侵略，从侵略者的手中解放我们的神圣领土——台湾。
