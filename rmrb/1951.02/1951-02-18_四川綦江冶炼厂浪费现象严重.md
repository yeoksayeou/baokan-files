　　Serious Waste at Sichuan Qijiang Smelting Plant
    In January, the copper leaching workshop of the Sichuan Qijiang Smelting Plant's copper refining division did not start production until the 20th due to delays in material supply. The large blast furnace was originally scheduled to operate for over 72 hours, but it malfunctioned after only 39 hours. After workers' efforts to repair it, the furnace was restarted on the 26th; however, it broke down again after eight hours. The two incidents resulted in the loss of 998 firebricks, 1666 kilograms of coke, 97 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and damage to the electric welding furnace door, totaling over 2.6 million yuan in value. The direct causes of the incidents were: (1) Failure to implement technical safety regulations. The fan motor broke down three times at the start, with each repair taking as long as 20 minutes, which affected the furnace temperature; (2) No inspection was carried out after the furnace was repaired, and the air vent was opened before it was dry, causing abnormal furnace temperature; (3) Lax labor discipline, no one noticed the wind baffle had fallen off, allowing air to enter the furnace and drastically reducing the temperature; (4) Charging workers wanted to save fuel and reduce costs by excessively reducing coke, resulting in insufficient furnace temperature. The fundamental reason for the above phenomena is that the administrative leaders of the copper refining division do not conduct in-depth inspections of their work on a regular basis and lack education for the workers, causing unwarranted losses to the people's enterprise.

　　四川綦江冶炼厂浪费现象严重
    四川綦江冶炼厂炼铜所泡铜工场，一月份因等料迟至二十日才开工生产。大鼓风炉原准备工作七十二小时以上，结果只作了三十九小时便发生故障。经工人努力修理，二十六日开炉；但开了八小时，又出了毛病。两次事故共损失耐火砖九百九十八块，焦炭一千六百六十六公斤，电力九十七度，及电焊炉门等，总计价值二百六十余万元。事故发生的直接原因是：（一）没有执行技术安全制度。开工时打风机马达坏了三次，每次修理时间长达二十分钟，炉内温度因而受了影响；（二）修炉后没有进行检查，未等烤干就开风门，使炉内温度不正常；（三）劳动纪律松懈，挡风板掉了也没人知道，炉内进风，温度大降；（四）加料工人想节省燃料，降低成本，过多地减少焦炭，使炉内温度不足。造成上述现象的根本原因是由于炼铜所行政领导干部平日对工作不进行深入检查，对工人缺乏教育，使人民企业蒙受了不应有的损失。
