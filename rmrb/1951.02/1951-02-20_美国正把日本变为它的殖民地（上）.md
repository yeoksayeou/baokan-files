　　The United States is Turning Japan into its Colony (Part 1)
　　Xia Richang, Zhang Qihua
　　The policy of American imperialism in occupying Japan after the war completely violated the Potsdam Declaration and the regulations of the Allied Council for Japan regarding the eradication of militarism and the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Japan. Instead, it has arbitrarily revived Japanese militarist and fascist forces, rearming Japan to make it a military base for aggression against Asia. At the same time, it has fostered and colluded with Japanese monopoly capitalists and their reactionary political representatives, frantically persecuting and exploiting the Japanese people, turning Japan completely into a colony of the United States.
　　For the past five years, all the actions of the United States in occupying Japan have fully demonstrated the criminal policy of American imperialism to turn Japan into its colony.
　　　　Colluding with Zaibatsu to Control Japanese Monopoly Capital
　　After the war, American monopoly capital actively colluded with and controlled Japanese monopoly capital, thereby manipulating the entire economic lifeline of the Japanese state, turning Japan into a colony of the United States.
　　American monopoly capital had close relations with Japanese monopoly capital even before the war. As early as after World War I, American monopoly capital giants Morgan and his partner Lamont established close financial relations with Japanese monopoly enterprises, especially Mitsui. From 1924 to 1931 alone, Japanese monopoly capital obtained various loans from Morgan amounting to 284 million yen. According to materials from the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry in 1931, approximately 86 industrial and commercial companies in Japan had considerable foreign capital invested, and 36 of these companies were American. According to estimates by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the total amount of U.S. industrial investment in Japan in 1940 was $300 million. Most of the capital was invested in Japanese companies, accounting for $188.1 million; the capital invested in enterprises directly controlled by U.S. companies totaled $61.5 million.
　　During the period when Japanese imperialism launched and carried out its war of aggression against China, it received supplies of military materials from the United States. Between 1932 and 1941, Japan purchased from the United States 90 percent of all U.S. exports of scrap steel, 45 percent of iron and steel semi-finished products, 45 percent of lead, 90 percent of copper, 18 percent of aluminum, and 65 percent of oil and petroleum products. According to materials from American newspapers, between 1937 and 1940, the United States obtained a huge amount of gold worth $693 million mainly from Japan due to the export of military materials.
　　The supply of military materials to Japan was carried out by the largest U.S. monopoly companies. For example, the "Mobil Oil Company" supplied more than half of the gasoline to Japan, and the "U.S. Steel Export Company" monopolized the supply of scrap iron and ferrous metals to Japan. And these companies were precisely controlled by American monopoly capital leaders such as Morgan and Rockefeller.
　　After Japan's surrender, MacArthur's headquarters promulgated the "Zaibatsu Dissolution Directive" in November 1945. On the one hand, the work of "dissolving" the zaibatsu was handed over to the zaibatsu's agents—the reactionary Japanese government; on the other hand, the "dissolution" order itself essentially preserved the Japanese zaibatsu and turned them into comprador-like monopoly capital subordinate to U.S. imperialism. After this "work" was carried out for four years, MacArthur officially declared in August 1949 that the work of dissolving the zaibatsu had been successfully completed.
　　What was the actual situation? The basic content of the so-called zaibatsu dissolution order was to transfer all the shares and assets held by the old zaibatsu's leading organizations, the "investment companies" (holding companies), and the zaibatsu families to the newly established "Investment Management Committee" (holding company liquidation committee), and to have the committee carry out the liquidation. U.S. imperialism manipulated the "Investment Management Committee," controlled the equity of all large enterprises, and also promulgated the "Financial Emergency Measures Order" during the Shidehara Cabinet to strengthen the control of Japanese financial capital. Therefore, the situation after the "successful completion" of the "dissolution" of the zaibatsu was: "Only in form were the eleven investment companies (holding companies) of Mitsui Gomei, Mitsubishi Goshi, Sumitomo Sosha, Yasuda Hozensha, Asano Sosha, Shibusawa Dozoku, Nomura Gomei, Mitsui Bussan, Mitsubishi Shoji, and Hattori Goshi dissolved. In reality, the Imperial Bank of the Mitsui zaibatsu was divided into the Imperial and Dai-Ichi banks, the Yasuda Bank was renamed the Fuji Bank, the Mitsubishi Bank was renamed the Chiyoda Bank, the Sumitomo Bank was renamed the Osaka Bank, the Nomura Bank was renamed the Daiwa Bank, and other large banks such as the former Sanwa Bank and others such as Tokai, Kobe, and Tokyo continued to dominate with their financial monopoly, monopolizing 52.4 percent of all financial deposits and 55.3 percent of all loans in Japan, and monopolizing the following industries in Japan: 68.6 percent of coal production, 76.5 percent of steel production, 50.6 percent of ammonium sulfate production, 65.16 percent of sulfuric acid production, and 98.6 percent of dye production." (See the Japanese magazine "New World," July 1949 issue)
　　While preserving the power of Japanese monopoly capital, U.S. imperialism directly controlled Japanese monopoly capital through various means, making it comprador-like and serving U.S. monopoly capital. MacArthur not only lifted the "restrictions" on more than 60 percent of the 1,203 monopolistic Japanese enterprises companies that were "restricted." These de-"restricted" enterprises could freely combine into larger monopoly enterprises or merge into other monopoly enterprises. As for the remaining 463 so-called "restricted" companies, according to the regulations of MacArthur's headquarters, as long as they sold 75 percent of their capital stock, they could be "de-restricted." The largest buyer of the so-called sale of stock would be none other than the American monopoly capitalists. In fact, since the U.S. occupation of Japan, it has invested in various sectors of the Japanese economy in the name of loans or "gifts." From fiscal year 1949, the so-called "U.S. Aid Fund" was established. It was composed of the amount equivalent to U.S. loans to Japan. The so-called loans were, in fact, U.S. exports to Japan. These "aid materials" were converted into cash upon arrival in Japan and transferred to the revenue part of Japan's special accounting budget, called the "U.S. Aid Fund," which was completely controlled by MacArthur's headquarters and invested in Japanese state-owned enterprises such as railways and telecommunications, and private enterprises such as electric power, shipping, coal, steel, chemical fertilizers, chemical medicines, and small and medium-sized enterprises. In this way, U.S. imperialism achieved the goal of U.S. state capital investment in Japan through counterpart funds from U.S. aid. The total amount of the "U.S. Aid Fund" in fiscal year 1949 was 150.8 billion yen, and in fiscal year 1950 it was 158.1 billion yen.
　　In addition to investing through state capital, American monopoly capitalists have also continuously and massively invaded the Japanese economy through private investment. American monopoly capitalists not only have their representative in Japan—MacArthur—but also successively dispatched Detroit banker Dodge, Dillon Reed Company vice president Draper, and Wall Street academician Columbia University professor Schup, and others to Japan to study the Japanese economic situation and actively engage in investment in Japan. The reactionary, traitorous government of Japan is also doing its utmost to flatter and "absorb American capital" by various means. The Yoshida government established the "Foreign Investment Introduction Committee," formulated foreign investment absorption bills, announced reductions in foreign income taxes, and dispatched Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda to the United States to attract capital. MacArthur gave the Japanese government a memorandum on January 14, 1949, stipulating that foreigners (mainly Americans, of course) engaged in trade in Japan do not need to apply for permits.
　　In this way, American monopoly capital has deeply invaded Japanese large and small enterprises, controlled Japanese monopoly capital, and through this, has manipulated the economic lifeline of Japan. According to extremely incomplete statistics: The Mellon-related Westinghouse Company holds a huge amount of shares in Mitsubishi Electric. The American Tetrault Company holds a huge amount of shares in Mitsubishi Oil. Mobil Oil Company holds 51 percent of the shares of Toa Fuel Company, which was jointly invested by various Japanese oil companies during the war. The Morgan-related General Electric Company holds a huge amount of shares in Mitsui Toshiba Electric, and International Standard Electric holds a huge amount of shares in Sumitomo Electric Industries and the Sumitomo-related Nippon Electric Company. More than half of the shares of Nippon Chemical are in the hands of American Smelting and Refining Company. Ford Motor Company not only controls the Japanese automobile industry but also invested $350 million in the ceramics industry. MacArthur not only supports American monopoly capitalists to smoothly buy up shares in Japanese enterprises and companies but also put forward very harsh conditions to Japanese entrepreneurs, while he himself is also a person with considerable equity in Japan. Everyone knows that MacArthur is one of the largest shareholders of American General Electric, and he has purchased a large portion of the shares of Sumitomo Corporation, which has a long-standing relationship with General Electric. MacArthur also acquired enough shares to manipulate refineries such as "Nippon Oil." In addition, he also bought most of the shares of Nippon Yusen Kaisha.
　　Not only in industry, but American monopoly capital has also gained control over Japan's commerce, shipping, banking, and other aspects. There are a total of 40 American trading companies in Japan, and they almost completely monopolize Japan's foreign trade. Japanese trading companies themselves only rely on earning a certain commission and have become agents for foreign companies to export goods. Shipping is also almost completely monopolized by foreign shipping companies, and there are 12 American shipping companies in Japan. Foreign banks, led by Citibank and Chase Bank, have established branches in Japan, controlling foreign exchange and other businesses.
　　Now, American monopoly capital has deeply invaded the Japanese economic sector, not only in electric power, petroleum, and machinery manufacturing, but also in the chemical industry, the production of iron and non-ferrous metals, the manufacture of precision machinery and instruments, and railway transportation. In fact, MacArthur's new directive on foreign investment in Japan, issued in 1949, provided ample protection for American investment. The Yoshida government has already exchanged the patent rights of the three major state-owned enterprises—state-owned railways, telecommunications, and tobacco monopoly—to the United States in the form of barter. By the beginning of 1950, the total amount of American investment in Japan had reached 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. And within 1950, many of America's largest banks, insurance companies, news agencies, publishing companies, industrial companies, film companies, foreign firms, shipping, and airlines established close relationships with many Japanese companies and foreign firms, and all established branches, purchased properties, and built houses in Japan.
　　This process of American capital exporting to Japan, controlling Japanese zaibatsu, and manipulating Japan's economic lifeline is clearly a process of reducing Japan to a U.S. colony.
　　　　Monopolizing Trade and Engaging in Unequal Exchange
　　Pre-war Japan was the world's largest trading country after Britain and the United States. After the war, U.S. imperialism completely monopolized Japan's foreign trade and cruelly exploited the Japanese people through unequal exchange.
　　In the four post-war years from 1946 to 1949, Japan had already incurred a trade deficit of $1.37 billion, equivalent to approximately 500 billion yen. This was due to the decrease in the quantity of goods exported and the loss of foreign markets, and also due to the U.S. imperialists' tyrannical policy of unequal exchange.
　　Because MacArthur occupied Japan, delayed the conclusion of a peace treaty, and used Japan as a base for aggression, China and Japan could not establish normal relations, so the Japanese people lost the trading country that previously accounted for about 25 percent of the total trade, which brought huge disasters to the Japanese people. At the same time, due to the crisis in the capitalist world and the pegged policy between the yen and the dollar, Japan's exports to other countries were greatly reduced. Japan's exports in 1949 were $510 million, only 30 percent of pre-war levels. Imports exceeded exports by $370 million. In 1950, the United States accounted for 46.5 percent of Japan's imports and 24 percent of its exports. Not only has the trade deficit over the years caused serious losses to Japanese trade, but also the fact that the Japanese economy can only serve as an appendage of U.S. monopoly capital has made Japan a colony of the United States.
　　As mentioned earlier, Japan's foreign trade is almost entirely controlled by American merchants, and Japanese trading companies are only reduced to the status of intermediaries. The unequal exchange implemented by U.S. imperialism is an extremely vicious means of exploiting the Japanese people. The raw materials and food that Japan imports are purchased at the high monopoly prices of U.S. monopoly capital. For example, coking coal for ironmaking costs only $11 per ton delivered in Japan from China's Kailuan coal mines, while it costs $24 per ton from the United States, more than twice as high. Korean scrap iron costs $18 per ton, while American scrap iron costs $30 per ton. Bauxite from Indonesia for aluminum production costs $6 per ton delivered to the far-away United States, while it costs $16 per ton delivered to Japan, which is closer. Salt from the Red Sea is worth only $4 per ton, but once it is shipped to Japan by the United States, it costs $19 per ton. The same is true for grain, which accounts for a large proportion of Japan's imports. Wheat imported from the United States costs 5,400 yen per koku (approx. 180 liters), while the Japanese government purchases wheat from Japanese rural areas for 2,333 yen per koku, only 42 percent of the price of American wheat imports.
　　U.S. monopoly capital also buys Japanese exports at low prices and then sells them at high prices, making huge profits. For example, cement purchased by American merchants for $16 per ton is sold overseas for $32. Bicycles purchased at $14.50 each are sold for $32.25. Eight-power telescopes purchased at $16 each are sold in the United States for $170, making a profit of more than ten times. The profits made by U.S. imperialism using this unequal exchange are staggering, sometimes reaching 300 to 1,200 percent, that is to say, the profit is up to 12 times the cost at the highest time.
　　In order to alleviate the U.S. economic crisis, U.S. monopoly capital will also force Japan to import large quantities of surplus goods that Japan does not need. For example, red phosphorus for making matches has always been in surplus in Japan and must be exported, but Japan has to import large quantities of red phosphorus at a high price of $1,208 per ton (equivalent to 434,800 yen) (the domestic price is 199,000 yen per ton). The same is true for ammonium sulfate used as fertilizer. For example, in 1949, Japan planned to import 2.24 million tons of grain, but by the end of 1949, the total amount of surplus American grain and grain from other places imported reached 3.8 million tons, exceeding the planned target by more than 50 percent, which caused the price of Japanese agricultural products to plummet and even reduced the area of cultivated land.
　　In addition, U.S. monopoly capital used the pegged policy of the dollar and yen exchange rate stipulated in the "Dodge Plan," that is, rigidly stipulating 360 yen to one dollar, to carry out plunder of the Japanese people. Because this made it difficult for Japanese exports due to higher costs and facilitated the export of American raw materials and commodities, occupying Japan's overseas markets. Japan's 1949 expanded export plan therefore failed, and the devaluation of the currencies of Britain and 30 other countries further increased the export difficulties faced by Japan.
　　This policy of aggression by U.S. imperialism, which the Japanese people call "panic imports" and cruel unequal exchange, has completely plunged the Japanese people into the tragic life of a colony.

　　美国正把日本变为它的殖民地  （上）
    夏日昌  张其华
    美帝国主义战后占领日本的政策，完全违反了波茨坦宣言及盟国对日委会关于肃清军国主义，建立和平民主日本国家的规定，而专横地复活日本军国主义法西斯势力，进行重新武装日本，以使其充作侵略亚洲的军事基地，同时扶植与勾结日本独占资本家及其反动政治代表人，疯狂迫害与剥削日本人民，使日本完全沦为美国的殖民地。
    五年来，美国占领日本的一切行为，充分地说明了美帝国主义将日本变为其殖民地的罪恶政策。
            与财阀勾结，控制日本独占资本
    战后，美国独占资本积极勾结与控制日本独占资本，进而操纵整个日本国家经济命脉，使日本沦为美国的殖民地。
    美国独占资本在战前即与日本独占资本有着密切的关系。远在第一次大战之后，美国独占资本巨头摩根及其伙伴拉孟特即与日本独占企业，尤其是三井建立了亲密的金融关系。仅在一九二四——一九三一年，日本独占资本就从摩根获得了各种贷款为数达二亿八千四百万日元。根据日本工商省一九三一年的材料，在日本约有八十六个工商公司投有相当的外国资本，在这些公司中，有三十六个是美国公司。据美国商务部估计，美国在日本的工业投资总额在一九四○年即为三亿美元。大部分资本都投在日本公司中，占一亿八千八百一十万美元；投入直接由美国公司管制的企业的资本计有六千一百五十万美元。
    日本帝国主义发动和进行侵华战争时期，即得到美国的军用物资的供应。在一九三二——一九四一年间，日本从美国购买了美国全部输出的百分之九十的废钢废铁，百分之四十五的铁、钢半制品，百分之四十五的铅，百分之九十的铜，百分之十八的铝及百分之六十五的石油和石油制品。根据美国报纸的材料，在一九三七——一九四○年间，美国主要因军用物资之输出由日本获得之价款，曾有价值六亿九千三百万美元的巨额黄金。
    供给日本军用物资都是由美国最大的独占公司实行的。例如供给日本汽油占半数以上的就是“美孚石油公司”，供给日本废铁和黑色金属的都是由“美国钢铁出口公司”垄断。而这些公司则正是由美国独占资本头子摩根、洛克菲勒等所控制的。
    日本投降后，麦克阿瑟总部曾于一九四五年十一月颁布了“财阀解体指令”，一方面，这个“解散”财阀的工作是交由财阀的代理人——日本反动政府来执行；一方面这个“解散”令的本身，实质是保留日本财阀并把它们变成隶属于美帝国主义的买办性的独占资本。这个“工作”进行了四年之后，麦克阿瑟即于一九四九年八月正式发表声明，说解散财阀的工作已经胜利完成。
    实际的情形如何呢？所谓解散财阀令的基本内容，就是把旧有财阀的领导机构“投资会社”（持股公司）及财阀同族所持有的股份资产一律移交新设的“投资监理委员会”（持股公司清理委员会），并由该委员会从事清理。而美帝国主义就从中操纵了“投资监理委员会”，控制了全部大企业的股权，并还在币原内阁期间，颁布了“金融紧急措置令”以加强日本金融资本的支配力量。所以“解散”财阀工作的“胜利结束后”的情况是：“仅在形式上解散了三井合名、三菱合资、住友总社、安田保善社、浅野总社、澁泽同族、野村合名、三井物产、三菱商事、服部合资等十一个投资会社（持股公司）。实际上，三井财阀的帝国银行分为帝国和第一两行，安田银行改称富士银行，三菱银行改称千代田银行，住友银行改称大阪银行，野村银行改称大和银行，以及旧日三和银行及其他如东海、神户、东京等大银行的出现，继续以金融独占的姿态，独占全日本的金融存款百分之五二·四，贷款百分之五五·三，并独占全日本如下的产业：煤生产量百分之六八·六，钢铁生产量百分之七六·五，硫安生产量百分之五○·六，硫酸生产量百分之六五·一六，染料生产量百分之九八·六。”（见日本杂志《新世界》一九四九年七月号）
    与保存日本独占资本势力同时，美帝国主义通过各种方式，直接控制了日本独占资本，使它带上有买办性而为美国独占资本服务。麦克阿瑟不但将受“限制”的一千二百零三家垄断性日本企业公司的百分之六十以上已被解除限制。这些被解除“限制”的企业就可以自由组合成更大的垄断企业或归并于其他垄断企业之中。而剩下的四百六十三家所谓受“限制”的公司，据麦克阿瑟总部的规定，只要它们出售其资本股票的百分之七十五，就可以“解除限制”。所谓出售股票的最大的收买人不会是别人，正是美国独占资本家。事实上，自美国占领日本之后，即以各种名目的贷款或“赠与”投入日本经济的各部门中去。从一九四九年度则设立了所谓“美援基金”。它是由相当于美国对日贷款的金额构成。所谓贷款，事实上是美国对日输出物资，这些“援助物资”运到日本后即折成现款，转入日本特别会计预算的收入部分，称为“美援基金”，完全归麦克阿瑟总部支配，投入日本的国营企业的铁路、电信和私营企业的电力、海运、煤炭、钢铁、化学肥料、化学药品及中小企业各部门中。这样美帝国主义通过了美援对等资金，达到美国国家资本对日投资的目的。一九四九年度“美援基金”的总额为一千五百零八亿日元，一九五○年度为一千五百八十一亿日元。
    在通过国家资本投资之外，美国独占资本家还以私人投资的方式不断地和大量地侵入日本经济。美国独占资本家不但在日本有其代表——麦克阿瑟，还陆续派遣了底特律银行家道奇、狄隆·里德公司副经理德莱伯及华尔街御用学者哥伦比亚大学教授萧普等人赴日研究日本经济情况，积极活动对日投资事宜。日本的反动卖国政府也正极尽谄媚地以种种办法“吸收美资”。吉田政府设立了“外资导入委员会”，制订了吸收外资法案，宣布减低外侨所得税，并派遣了藏相（财长）池田勇人到美国去招徕资本。麦克阿瑟则于一九四九年一月十四日给日本政府备忘录，规定外国人（当然主要是美国人）在日的贸易业，无须申请许可手续。
    就是这样，美国独占资本深深地侵入了日本的大小企业，控制了日本独占资本，并通过这操纵了日本的经济命脉。据极不完全的统计：梅隆系的威斯丁豪斯公司握有三菱电机会社的巨额股票。美国泰埃特华脱公司握有三菱石油会社的巨额股票。美孚石油公司握有日本战时各石油公司共同投资设立的东亚燃料公司的百分之五十一股票。摩根系的通用电业公司握有三井东京芝浦电气公司的巨额股票，国际标准电气公司握有住友电气工业会社及住友系日本电气会社的巨额股票。日本化学会社股票的过半数在美国制铅公司手里。福特汽车公司不仅控制了日本汽车工业，还投资了三亿五千万美元在陶磁业中。麦克阿瑟不但支持着美国独占资本家使他们顺利地收买日本企业和公司的股票，并向日本企业家提出了非常苛刻的条件，而他本人同时也是在日本握有相当股权的人。麦克阿瑟是美国通用电气公司最大的股东之一，这是大家知道的，他在日本收买了与通用电气公司有攸久关系的住友公司的一大部分的股票。麦克阿瑟也在“日本石油”等炼油厂中取得了足以操纵的股票。此外，他还买进了日本邮船株式会社股票的大部分。
    不仅在产业方面，美国独占资本对日本的商业、海运、银行等方面也都取得了控制权。在日本的美国贸易公司共有四十家，它们几乎完全独占了日本的对外贸易，日本本身的贸易公司则只靠收入一定的佣金，成为外国公司输出商品的经纪人。海运也几乎完全由外国轮船公司所独占，美国在日有轮船公司十二家。以美国的花旗银行、大通银行为首的外国银行在日建立了分行，控制着对外汇兑等业务。
    现在，美国独占资本已经深深地侵入了日本的经济事业，不但是电力、石油、机器制造业，同时也已侵入了化学工业、铁与非铁金属的生产、精确的机器和仪器的制造以及铁路运输业等。事实上在一九四九年麦克阿瑟所发布的外资对日投资新指令，使美国投资更获得充分的保障。而吉田政府则已将国营铁道、电信电话、烟草专卖三大国营事业的专利权以易货的方式易给美国。到一九五○年初，美国在日的投资总数即已达二十五亿美元。而一九五○年内，许多的美国最大的银行、保险公司、通讯社、出版公司、实业公司、影片公司、洋行、轮船和航空公司，都与许多日本公司洋行建立了密切关系，并都在日本设立分号，购置财产，建筑房屋。
    这一美国资本输出到日本，并掌握了日本财阀，操纵日本经济命脉的过程，显然就是降日本为美国殖民地的过程。
            垄断贸易，进行不等价交换
    战前的日本，是次于英、美的世界最大贸易国。战后，美帝国主义则完全垄断了日本的对外贸易，并以不等价交换的手段，残酷地剥削着日本人民。
    从一九四六到一九四九这战后四年当中，日本在贸易上已经入超十三亿七千万美元，约合五千亿日元。这是由于商品输出的数量减少和国外市场的丧失，同时，也是由于美帝国主义的横暴的不等价交换政策所致。
    由于麦克阿瑟占领日本，拖延订立和约，并利用日本作为侵略基地，使得中日两国不能建立正常关系，于是日本人民失去了以前约占贸易总额百分之二十五的交易国家，这给日本人民带来巨大的灾害。同时由于资本主义世界的危机，和日元与美元的钉死政策，也大大减少了日本向其他国家的输出。一九四九年日本出口五亿一千万美元，仅及战前的百分之三十。入口则超过出口达三亿七千万美元。而一九五○年日本对外贸易中，输入方面，美国占百分之四六·五，输出方面，美国占百分之二四。不仅由于历年的入超，已使日本贸易受到严重损失，同时，由于日本经济只有作为美国独占资本的附庸，而使日本沦为美国的殖民地。
    前面提到，日本的对外贸易几乎完全掌握在美商手中，而日本贸易公司仅陷于中间人的地位。而美帝国主义所执行的不等价交换则是剥削日本人民的极为毒辣的手段。日本输入的原料和食粮都是按照美国独占资本的高昂垄断价格购进的。如炼铁用的强黏结性煤，中国开滦煤在日本交货每吨只十一美元，而从美国购进的则每吨为二十四美元，高出一倍以上。朝鲜的废铁每吨十八美元，而美国废铁则每吨三十美元。印尼的制铝用铁矾土，在运往远处的美国交货为每吨六美元，而运至更近的日本每吨则为十六美元。红海的盐，每吨仅值四美元余，但一经美国运到日本，每吨便达十九美元。占日本输入大宗的粮食也是一样。从美国输入的小麦每日石为五四○○日元，而日本政府向日本农村征购的小麦，每日石则为二三三三日元，仅合美麦输入价格的百分之四十二。
    美国独占资本又以低价购进日本的输出品，然后以高价卖出，获致暴利。例如美商以每吨十六美元购进的洋灰，运到海外就卖到三十二美元。按每辆十四元五毛美元购进的自行车，运出即卖到三十二元二毛五美元。以每架十六美元购进的八倍望远镜，在美国竟卖到一百七十美元，获利达十倍多。美帝国主义利用这种不等价交换所攫取的利润是惊人的，有时达百分之三百至一千二百，就是说利润最高时为成本的十二倍。
    美国独占资本为了缓和美国经济危机，还将强迫日本输入大批日本所不需要的剩余商品。例如制火柴用的红磷，日本一向过剩而必须输出，但日本却得以每吨一二○八美元（合四十三万四千八百日元）的高价（国内价格为每吨十九万九千日元）输入大批红磷。作肥料用的硫安也是如此。又如一九四九年日本预定输入粮食二百二十四万吨，但至一九四九年度末所输入的美国的剩余粮食及其他地方的谷物共达三百八十万吨，超过预定计划百分之五十以上，这就使日本农产物价格暴跌，甚至使耕地的面积也为缩小。
    另外，美国独占资本利用了“道奇方案”中所规定的美元与日元汇率的钉死政策，即硬性规定三百六十日元对一美元，以进行对日本人民的掠夺。因为这样就使日本出口货因成本较高发生困难，便利了美国原料、商品的输出，霸占日本在海外的市场。日本一九四九年扩大输出计划就因此遭到失败，而英国及其他三十个国家货币贬值，日本所面临的出口困难更为增大。
    美帝国主义的这种被日本人民称做“恐慌输入”和残酷的不等价交换的侵略政策，使日本人民完全陷于殖民地的悲惨生活境地。
