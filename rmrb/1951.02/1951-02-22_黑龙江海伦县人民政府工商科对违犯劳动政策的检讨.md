Regarding Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

　　Heilongjiang Hailun County People's Government Industry and Commerce Section's Self-Criticism Regarding Violations of Labor Policy

　　Editor:
　　The "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 24th published criticisms of certain factories in our county for violating labor policies. After our investigation, these are all factual. We hereby offer the following self-criticism:

　　Our county's gunny sack factory, Trade No. 2 Rice Mill, Hailun Oil Mill, etc., arbitrarily imposed overtime, seriously damaging the health of workers. Especially at the beginning of the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign, many factories were eager to complete their tasks, and the phenomenon of overtime became even more serious, resulting in many workers becoming ill. The most serious case was the gunny sack factory, which did not take into account the special interests of female workers, canceled their menstrual leave, and arbitrarily dismissed workers, seriously violating labor policies. In addition, due to insufficient contact between the administration and the trade union, the production enthusiasm of workers was not effectively mobilized through the trade union, rendering the trade union ineffective. Trade union cadres simply believed that "during the Resist America, Aid Korea period, workers should work harder." Therefore, the trade union did not raise any objections to the excessive working hours at the Trade No. 2 Rice Mill, Hailun Oil Mill, etc. Workers reflected, "The trade union only comes to us when it's time to work, and doesn't solve any other problems!" This statement by the workers is correct. It is a fitting criticism of both the administration and the trade union, and we should humbly accept it.

　　In addition to making this self-criticism, we plan to send cadres deep into the factories to resolve these unreasonable problems and overcome our past shortcomings in neglecting worker welfare.

### 黑龙江海伦县人民政府工商科对违犯劳动政策的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评建议的反应

　　黑龙江海伦县人民政府工商科对违犯劳动政策的检讨
    编辑同志：
    一月二十四日，人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登我县某些工厂违犯了劳动政策的批评。经我们调查都是事实，特作检讨如下：
    我县草袋工厂、贸易二米厂、海伦油坊等，随便加班加点，严重地损害了工人身体健康。特别是在抗美援朝开始时，很多工厂急于完成任务，加班加点现象更为严重，结果很多工人都害了病。最严重的是草袋工厂，不照顾女工的特殊利益，取消了她们的例假，又随便解雇了工人，严重地违反了劳动政策。此外，由于行政与工会联系不够，没有很好通过工会来发动工人的生产积极性，使工会失去了作用。而工会干部则单纯认为：“抗美援朝期间，工人应多干点活”。因此，工会对贸易二米厂、海伦油坊等劳动时间过长并未提出意见。工人反映说：“干活，工会就找我们来，其他什么问题都不给解决！”工人这种说法是对的。是给行政和工会一个恰当的批评，我们应当虚心接受。
    现在我们除作检讨外，并拟派干部深入工厂解决这些不合理的问题，克服过去轻视工人福利的缺点。
