　　【Report from this Newspaper】According to Xinhua News Agency: This year, on the "February 7th" anniversary, workers across the country unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen the forces resisting America and aiding Korea by deeply launching a production emulation drive, and to oppose U.S. imperialism's re-arming of Japan. Approximately thirty to forty cities nationwide held rallies to commemorate "February 7th." In Wuhan, Zhengzhou, and Changxindian—the cradles of the "February 7th" Strike—as well as in cities such as Chengdu, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Harbin, and Dalian, workers also held demonstrations against America and in support of Korea.
　　The Wuhan Workers' Corps was also established on the 7th, holding a grand review and parade. All sectors of Wuhan society also held a public memorial ceremony for the "February 7th" martyrs in Jiang'an District—the cradle of the "February 7th" Strike. After listening to reports from veteran "February 7th" workers, the thirteen factories and enterprises in Jiang'an District expressed their intention to work hard in production and have drafted terms to challenge the Ma Hengchang Group. Twelve thousand workers from various industries and people from all walks of life in Zhengzhou also gathered on the 7th to commemorate "February 7th" and held demonstrations against America and in support of Korea. At the memorial meeting, forty-seven crew members from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's model locomotive team swore their determination to carry forward the heroic anti-imperialist fighting tradition of "February 7th" and volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the war. To commemorate "February 7th," the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government has announced the renaming of Changchun Road—the site where Zhengzhou workers suffered slaughter by feudal warlords twenty-eight years ago—to "February 7th Road."
　　Veteran workers from the "February 7th" era, scattered throughout the country, are a powerful encouragement to the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers during this year's "February 7th" commemoration. In Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Xi'an, Yinchuan (Ningxia), Dalian, and the southwestern cities of Chongqing and Kunming, veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" Strike were invited to give vivid reports on the historical facts of the "February 7th" struggle; they also called on young workers to learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the "February 7th" martyrs, to do a good job in production, and to step up the resistance against America and aid to Korea. All the workers expressed their respect for the veteran "February 7th" workers. In Kunming, during the demonstration parade, ten veteran workers from the "February 7th" era, adorned with red flowers, rode on tall horses and received warm cheers from the citizens along the way.
　　In many places, workers held discussions on improving production experiences during the "February 7th" commemoration and specifically discussed ways to promote the production emulation drive in depth. All crew members serving on the first and second Beijing-Manzhouli trains in Qiqihar proposed ten conditions to challenge all main lines and major trains across the country, and also challenged the Ma Hengchang Group with the same conditions. Workers in Harbin factories had already proposed before the Spring Festival that they would not be absent from work before and after the Spring Festival.
　　The parade of over 60,000 workers in Chengdu brought great excitement and strength to the citizens celebrating the Spring Festival, and many citizens shouted slogans such as opposing U.S. imperialism's re-arming of Japan along with the parade. Workers in Hengyang and other places also formed groups to visit the families of martyrs, military personnel, and volunteers in Korea during the "February 7th" holiday to offer condolences and celebrate the Spring Festival. Workers in the Northeast, who suffered the longest under Japanese imperialism, expressed deep indignation at the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism in arming Japan. Workers in Shenyang, Harbin, Dalian, and other places expressed during the "February 7th" commemorative rallies that this was absolutely intolerable and resolved to continue strengthening the work of resisting America and aiding Korea.
　　In Luzhou, southern Sichuan, more than twenty rural propaganda teams organized by over a thousand workers used the Spring Festival holiday to go to the countryside to carry out propaganda for resisting America and aiding Korea, to congratulate the peasants on the victory of rent reduction and to wish them a happy Spring Festival. They also held worker-peasant get-togethers in many villages, and the local peasants also took out Spring Festival food to treat the workers.
