Xinhua News Agency Report:

The National Cooperative General Association is striving to transport fertilizer to farmers across the country in time for spring plowing.

Due to the widespread bumper harvests in rural areas nationwide last year, coupled with the fact that approximately 140 million people in newly liberated areas will complete land reform this spring, farmers have a high level of enthusiasm for production. The demand for fertilizer this year is therefore much greater than in previous years. For this reason, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council entrusted the National Cooperative General Association with the task of supplying fertilizer to rural areas in East China, North China, Central South, Northwest, and other regions for 1951 during last winter. Special funds were allocated for this purpose and forwarded by the National Cooperative General Association to the major administrative region cooperative general associations within the customs, so as to purchase the fertilizers needed by farmers in each region and then transport them to various locations.

According to the needs of farmers within the customs, the fertilizers to be supplied on a large scale in an organized and planned manner this year include 180,000 tons of ammonium sulfate and more than 1 million tons of bean cake, cottonseed cake, etc. Among them, all of the ammonium sulfate and 700,000 tons of bean cake have been agreed upon by the National Cooperative General Association and the China Native Produce Company, with the latter responsible for the supply. The remainder will be purchased locally by the major administrative region cooperative general associations or exchanged with the Northeast Cooperative General Association for materials such as cotton and cloth. The China Native Produce Company offers preferential treatment to cooperative members for the fertilizers it supplies: the price of ammonium sulfate is reduced by 5% from the company's wholesale list price, and the price of bean cake is reduced by 2%. Therefore, farmers within the customs will obtain enough fertilizer for the entire year's increased production. Currently, enough ammonium sulfate for spring plowing by farmers within the customs has been largely prepared. The bean cake needed for spring plowing is being rushed to its destination via land and water transportation.

In terms of technology, the agricultural and forestry departments of people's governments at all levels will assist in this work of supplying fertilizer to farmers across the country through the cooperative system. The focus of fertilizer supply will be on areas producing cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugar, and other crops. The method of supply will be mainly cash sales, but a portion will be sold on credit to impoverished farmers as appropriate.

Since the cooperative societies have limited funds to manage fertilizer this time, while the amount of fertilizer needed by farmers is large, accelerating capital turnover has become the key to whether cooperative societies in various places can complete the fertilizer supply task in a timely manner. In this regard, the East China Cooperative General Association and the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Association are currently doing better. According to the plan of the Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Hebei Province needs 67.2 billion yuan worth of fertilizer, but the province only received loans of 34 billion yuan. Through the efforts of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Association, various fertilizers worth 70.236 billion yuan have been ordered, exceeding 206.5% of the funds it received and 4.5% more than the Department of Agriculture and Forestry's requirement. The East China Cooperative General Association has decided that the cooperative general associations in various parts of East China will transfer 43 billion yuan from business operations, plus 60 billion yuan from cash sales turnover, which can guarantee the completion of the task of supplying fertilizer worth a total of 210 billion yuan needed in the entire region.

### 合作总社接受国家委托供应全国春耕用肥

　　合作总社接受国家委托供应全国春耕用肥
    【新华社讯】全国合作总社正努力把肥料及时运送到全国各地准备春耕的农民手中。
    由于去年全国农村普遍丰收，加以今春约有一亿四千万人口的新解放区将完成土地改革，农民们生产情绪很高，今年需要肥料的数量要比往年大得多。因此，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会在去年冬季便将一九五一年华东、华北、中南、西北等地区农村的肥料供应任务委托给全国合作总社办理，并为此拨付专款，由全国合作总社转发关内各大行政区合作总社，以便采购各该区农民所需肥料，然后再分别运至各地。
    按照关内农民的需要，今年大规模有组织有计划地供应的肥料，计有肥田粉十八万吨，豆饼、棉饼等约一百万吨以上。其中肥田粉全部及豆饼七十万吨已由全国合作总社与中国土产公司商妥，由该公司负责供应，其余由各大行政区合作总社在本地采购，或以棉花、布匹等物资向东北合作总社交换。中国土产公司供应的肥料对合作社社员有优待：肥田粉价格按公司批发牌价减低百分之五；豆饼减低百分之二。因此，今年关内农民将获得足够全年增产之用的肥料。目前足够关内农民春耕之用的肥田粉已大体准备齐全。春耕所需豆饼正经由水陆交通赶运中。
    此次通过合作社系统供应全国农民肥料的工作，在技术上由各级人民政府农林部门给予协助。供应肥料的重点为产棉、麻、烟、糖等的地区。供应的方法以现售为主，但对贫苦农民将适当赊销一部分。
    由于这次合作社经营肥料的资金不多，而农民所需肥料数量很大，加速资金周转便成为各地合作社是否能及时完成肥料供应任务的关键。在这方面，目前以华东区合作总社和河北省合作总社做得较好。河北全省按省人民政府农林厅的计划，需六百七十二亿元的肥料，但该省只分配到贷款三百四十亿元。经河北省合作总社的努力，已订购的各种肥料达七百零二亿三千六百万元，已超过其所领资金的百分之二百零六点五，超过农林厅要求数的百分之四点五。华东区合作总社决定由华东各地合作总社从业务经营中调剂四百三十亿元，加上现售周转调剂六百亿元，可以保证完成供应全区所需总值二千一百亿元的肥料的任务。
