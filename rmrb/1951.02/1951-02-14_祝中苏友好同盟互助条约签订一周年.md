　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
　　China Peace Committee

　　On behalf of the Chinese people who are striving for the sacred task of defending world peace and opposing American aggression, this committee warmly celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

	The Sino-Soviet Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty consolidates the brotherly friendship and unity that has long existed between the people of our country and the great Soviet people, and gives our people an extremely strong ally in preventing and stopping the resurgence of aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any country directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in aggressive acts. This is a huge blow to American imperialism, which is using Japan as a base for aggression and trying to rearm Japan and drive Japan as a pawn to invade Asia. Therefore, it not only consolidates the victorious achievements of our people's revolution, but also makes a major contribution to guaranteeing and promoting the victory of world peace, democracy and socialism.

	We, the Chinese people, deeply thank Marshal Stalin and the Soviet government and people for their consistent and sincere support for our people's just struggle against American aggression and aid to Korea. Our people fully understand that the great victories won by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army against the American aggressor troops who are invading Korea and threatening our country's security are inseparable from the existence of the powerful and invincible Sino-Soviet alliance and the strong support of the Soviet Union.

	On February 1, American imperialism manipulated and hijacked the United Nations General Assembly to pass a slanderous case that slandered our people's voluntary action to resist America and aid Korea as "aggression," and refused a peaceful resolution to the Korean and other important Far Eastern issues. However, this despicable act of reversing right and wrong by the American aggressors cannot save it from the failure of its adventurous aggression against Korea, nor can it prevent the complete victory of the Chinese and Korean people, because we have the sympathy and support of the incomparably powerful world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, especially we have the selfless assistance given to us by the powerful Soviet Union in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

	After suffering a serious defeat on the Korean battlefield, American imperialism is stepping up its unilateral activities to make peace with Japan and rearm Japan, in an attempt to turn Japan into its pawn for aggression against Asia, that is, to push Japan and the Japanese people onto the road of destruction. However, this arrogant conspiracy can be shattered, because our people, the Japanese people, and the people of other nations in the East are jointly striving to oppose this evil plan and action of the United States, especially the two major powers, China and the Soviet Union, which have consolidated their alliance by treaty, will never allow the United States to realize this evil plan. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance states: "The two contracting parties jointly guarantee to take all necessary measures to prevent the resurgence of aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or other countries which directly or indirectly collude with Japan in aggressive acts. If either of the contracting parties is attacked by Japan or a country allied with Japan and is thus in a state of war, the other contracting party shall immediately provide military and other assistance with all its strength." "The two contracting parties guarantee that, with mutual consent and other allied countries during the Second World War, they shall jointly achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan within the shortest possible period." It can be seen from this that the attempt of American imperialism to bypass the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union to unilaterally make peace with Japan and rearm Japan is bound to fail and is bound to be met with a bloody nose.

	We, the Chinese people, deeply thank Marshal Stalin and the Soviet government and people for the assistance they have given us in economic and cultural undertakings in the past year in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements. This friendly assistance has accelerated the restoration of our people's economic and cultural education undertakings and the progress of key construction work, enabling our people to achieve brilliant achievements on the financial, economic, cultural and educational fronts in the past year.

	The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance guarantees that our people will be able to completely defeat American aggression, and guarantees that our people will be able to strive for a peaceful environment for large-scale construction work.

	On the occasion

　　祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年
　　中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    本会代表正在为保卫世界和平反对美国侵略的神圣任务而奋斗的中国人民，热烈地庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约巩固了我国人民和伟大的苏联人民间早已存在的兄弟一般的友谊和团结，使我国人民在防止及制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为与日本相勾结的任何国家的再起侵略与破坏和平的斗争中有了极为强大的同盟国，这对于利用日本作侵略基地和力图重新武装日本驱使日本作爪牙侵略亚洲的美国帝国主义是一个巨大的打击，因而这不但巩固了我国人民革命的胜利成果，而且对于保障和促进全世界和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利也是一个重大的贡献。
    我们中国人民深切地感谢斯大林大元帅和苏联政府及人民对于我国人民反对美国侵略援助朝鲜的正义斗争的一贯的真诚的声援。我国人民完全了解，我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军对于侵略朝鲜威胁我国安全的美国侵略军所赢得的重大胜利，是与强大无敌的中苏友好同盟的存在及苏联的有力声援分不开的。
    美国帝国主义已在二月一日操纵和劫持联合国大会通过诬蔑我国人民抗美援朝的志愿行动为“侵略”的诽谤案，拒绝朝鲜及远东其他重要问题的和平解决。但是美国侵略者这种卑鄙的颠倒是非的行径决不能挽救它对朝鲜的冒险侵略的失败，也决不能阻止中国人民和朝鲜人民的全盘胜利，因为我们拥有以苏联为首的强大无比的世界和平民主阵营的同情和支援，特别是我们拥有强大的苏联根据中苏友好同盟互助条约所给予我们的无私的援助。
    美国帝国主义在朝鲜战场遭到严重失败之后，正在加紧进行片面对日媾和重新武装日本的活动，妄图把日本变作它的侵略亚洲的爪牙，就是说把日本和日本人民推向毁灭的道路。但是这种狂妄的阴谋是可以打破的，因为我国人民、日本人民和东方其他各民族人民正在共起奋力反对美国这种罪恶的计划和行动，特别是已用条约巩固的结成同盟的中苏两大强国决不容许美国实现这种罪恶计划。中苏友好同盟互助条约写着：“缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭，因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。”“缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结。”由此可见，美国帝国主义企图撇开中苏两大国片面对日媾和并重新武装日本，是一定行不通的，是一定要碰得头破血流的。
    我们中国人民深切地感谢斯大林大元帅和苏联政府及人民在过去一年中根据中苏友好同盟互助条约及其他协定，在经济及文化事业上所给予我们的帮助。这些友谊援助已经加速了我国人民经济和文化教育事业的恢复和重点建设工作的进展，使我国人民一年来在财政经济及文化教育的战线上获得了辉煌的成绩。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约保证我国人民一定能够彻底打垮美国的侵略，并保证我国人民一定能够争得进行大规模建设工作的和平环境。
    际此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年之际，本会号召全国人民在英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，继续巩固和发展中苏两国人民兄弟一般的友谊和团结，进一步开展抗美援朝、反对武装日本的爱国运动，努力支援我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，彻底打败美国侵略者，为保卫远东和平和世界和平而奋斗。
