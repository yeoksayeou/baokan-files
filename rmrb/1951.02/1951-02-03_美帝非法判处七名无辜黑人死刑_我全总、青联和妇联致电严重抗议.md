Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to a report from the Electric News Agency in New York: The death sentences handed down by the Martinsville, Virginia, local court in the United States against seven innocent black youths on fabricated charges are scheduled to be carried out on February 2nd.

As a concrete measure to advance political fascism, the police authorities in Martinsville, Virginia, United States, conducted a large-scale search of black residential areas in January 1949 based on one-sided false accusations, and unreasonably arrested seven black youths. After being arrested, these youths were subjected to torture in the police station and were forced to confess. When they were transferred to the court, all seven pointed out that their confessions were not true and were entirely the result of forced torture. However, the court still tried them and summarily sentenced them all to death on the fabricated charge of "rape."

The news immediately aroused widespread protests. Under the initiative of the "American Civil Rights Congress" and the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People," a vigorous protest and rescue movement was launched in the United States. Abroad, organizations such as the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Association of Journalists also issued appeals, calling on people around the world to protest this illegal atrocity. During the rescue movement, more than 35,000 protest letters and telegrams were sent from the United States and around the world to the Governor of Virginia.

Under strong protest, the court was forced to postpone the execution of the death sentence twice. However, during this period, the U.S. Federal Supreme Court brazenly rejected the appeals of the seven black youths. Therefore, these seven victims of fascist tyranny will be executed on February 2nd under the "rule of law" of racial discrimination in the United States.

In order to express protest, the Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council of New York has held a rotating vigil in front of the White House since January 30th, demanding that Truman intervene in this framed-up case in his capacity as President at this final moment.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation jointly sent a telegram today to the Governor of Virginia, Mr. Battle, protesting the barbaric atrocity of the Martinsville, Virginia, local court in sentencing seven black youths to death, and demanding a stay of execution. The telegram is as follows:

Mr. Battle:

The news of the impending execution of seven black people in Martinsville has aroused the greatest anger among the Chinese people. These seven black people are falsely accused of rape. Their so-called confessions were coerced under inhumane torture, and were later rejected by them in open court.

The death sentence based on such confessions, and the verdict of a completely arbitrary jury panel in which no black people participated, violates all principles of law and justice upheld by civilized humanity. This barbaric verdict further provides new evidence of the so-called "law and order" now prevalent in the United States, which only protects extreme racist fascist thugs and war-mongers.

On behalf of all workers, youth, and women in China, we lodge a serious protest against this inhumane and unjust verdict, and demand that you immediately use your authority to stop the execution of the seven innocent black victims, and grant them a fair trial.

                             All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                 All-China Democratic Youth Federation
                                  All-China Democratic Women's Federation
                                     February 1, 1951

### 美帝非法判处七名无辜黑人死刑  我全总、青联和妇联致电严重抗议

　　美帝非法判处七名无辜黑人死刑        
    我全总、青联和妇联致电严重抗议
    【新华社一日讯】据电通社纽约讯：美国弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔城地方法院以诬告的罪名对七名无辜黑人青年所判处的死刑，定于二月二日执行。
    作为推进政治法西斯化的具体办法的一部分，美国弗吉尼亚州马丁斯维尔城警察当局于一九四九年一月间以片面诬告之词大事搜查黑人居民区，并无理逮捕了黑人青年七人。这些青年被捕之后，曾在警察局备受非刑拷打，并被苦逼成招地认了口供。当把他们移送到法院时，七个人都指出：他们的口供并非事实，完全是非刑强迫的结果。可是，法院依然对他们进行了审判，并以强加的“强奸”罪名，草草地把他们全体判处死刑。
    消息传出后，立即引起了广泛的抗议。在“美国民权保障大会”及“美国有色人种协进会”发起之下，美国国内曾开展了有力的抗议和拯救运动。在国外，世界民主青联与国际新闻记者协会等团体，也曾发出呼吁，号召全世界人民抗议这一非法暴行。在援救运动期间，从美国和世界各地发给弗吉尼亚州州长的抗议函电，曾经达到三万五千封以上。
    在强烈的抗议之下，法院曾被迫两次延缓死刑的执行。可是，在此期间，美国联邦最高法院竟悍然拒绝了七名黑人青年的上诉。因此，这七名法西斯暴政下的遭难者将于二月二日在美国的种族歧视“法治”下被处死。
    为了表示抗议，纽约市艺术、科学、自由职业协会特自一月三十日起在白宫面前举行轮流守卫运动，并要求杜鲁门于此最后时刻以总统身份干涉这一诬害案件。
    【新华社一日讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合总会及中华全国民主妇女联合会于今日联名致电美国弗吉尼亚州州长巴特尔抗议该州马丁斯维尔城地方法院判处七名黑人青年以死刑的野蛮暴行，并要求停止执刑。电文如下：巴特尔先生：
    马丁斯维尔城七个黑人即将执行死刑的消息传来后，已激起我们中国人民最大的愤怒。这七个黑人被诬控强奸。所谓他们的供词，是在非人的毒刑下强逼出来的，而后来在公开法庭上已为他们所拒斥。
    根据这种供状所判的死刑，以及没有一个黑人参加的完全专横的陪审委员会的判词，违反了所有文明人类所坚持的法律与正义的原则。这一野蛮的判决，进一步提供了现在美国流行的，只保护极端种族歧视法西斯暴徒与战争贩子的所谓“法律与秩序”的新的罪证。
    我们代表中国全体工人、青年和妇女对这种非人道的非正义的判决，提出严重抗议，要求你立即运用你的职权停止对七位无辜黑人牺牲者的执行，并给予他们一个公正的审讯。
