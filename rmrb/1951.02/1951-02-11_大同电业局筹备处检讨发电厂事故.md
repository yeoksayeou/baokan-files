    Datong Electric Power Bureau Preparatory Office Reviews Power Plant Accident
    Last month, the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published a criticism of our office by Comrade Zhang Yi. In addition to thanking him for his help, we will now describe the handling of the frozen and cracked No. 3 boiler economizer bend accident as follows:
    Since No. 4 boiler was put into operation in our power plant, fearing a breakdown during operation, we did not dare to drain the water from the No. 3 boiler when it was shut down, in preparation for use at any time. After testing, we learned that the water quality in the No. 3 boiler was poor, and the operation of the No. 4 boiler was normal. Therefore, the engineer notified Zhang Tiansuo, the head of the boiler section, to drain the water from the No. 3 boiler. Due to the inadequate execution of the task by the comrades who received it, the economizer water was not completely drained. In addition, when repairing the No. 3 boiler induced draft fan bearing bush on November 24th last year, the wind shield iron plate of the induced draft fan bearing was not installed properly, and the operating gear wheel of the lower wind damper of the No. 3 boiler economizer was removed as a sample to match the gear wheel of the No. 4 boiler. As a result, cold air entered the No. 3 boiler economizer from the duct, causing the accident of the No. 3 boiler economizer bend being frozen and damaged at 3:30 on November 27th last year (the second half of the night of the 26th and 27th, the weather was as cold as minus 18 degrees Celsius). When the accident occurred (3:30 on the 27th), the duty operator heard the explosion of the frozen and cracked bend and immediately reported it to the duty foreman, Yang Yuqing. Yang Yuqing not only failed to deal with it in a timely manner, but also claimed that it was a ghost, deliberately confusing the duty operator, which prolonged the accident time. It was not until 7:30 on the 27th that he reported the accident to the section chief, resulting in the freezing and damaging of one hundred and thirty-one bends. Originally, Yang Yuqing was a "diǎn chuán shī" of the reactionary Taoist Yiguandao sect and has been spreading rumors and sabotage. After several educations, he did not show any signs of repentance. The expansion of the No. 3 boiler bend accident is indeed related to the deliberate sabotage of the counter-revolutionary element Yang Yuqing. We have handed him over to the People's Court for handling according to law. After the accident, after inspection and discussion by all parties, it was considered that Zhang Tiansuo, the head of the boiler section, was irresponsible for his work, showed extreme carelessness and paralysis, and it was decided to give him a major demerit. The leadership of this plant did not go deep into the work usually and was negligent, resulting in this accident. We have submitted a request to the General Electric Power Administration for punishment.

### 大同电业局筹备处检讨发电厂事故

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

    大同电业局筹备处检讨发电厂事故
    上月人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了张毅同志对我处的批评。我们除了感谢他对我们的帮助外，现在我们将对于处理冻裂三号锅炉省煤器湾头事故的情况分述如下：
    本处电厂自四号炉参加运转后，因恐在运转中发生故障，所以在三号炉停炉时，未敢将锅炉存水放出，准备随时应用。后经化验，知道三号炉内水质不良，且四号炉运转情况正常，于是由工程师通知锅炉股长张天锁将三号锅炉的存水放掉。由于接受任务的同志在执行时不够彻底，未将省煤器的水放尽，加上去年十一月二十四日检修三号炉吸风机轴瓦时未将吸风机轴承挡风铁板装好，又把三号炉省煤器下部挡风闸门操纵牙轮拆去作样品，以配制四号炉的牙轮。因此冷风从风道进入三号炉省煤器，造成去年十一月二十七日三点半（二十六、七两日后半夜，天气冷至摄氏零下十八度）冻坏三号锅炉省煤器湾头的事故。当事故发生时（二十七日三点三十分），值班员听到湾头冻裂的爆炸声，即刻报告值班班长杨玉庆。杨玉庆不但未及时予以处理，反说是闹鬼，故意迷惑值班员，使事故时间延长。至二十七日七时半，他才把事故情况报告股长，以致冻坏湾头一三一个。本来杨玉庆系反动道门一贯道之点传师，一贯进行造谣破坏，经数度教育，并没有改悔的意思。此次三号锅炉湾头事故的扩大，确和反革命分子杨玉庆蓄意破坏有关。我们已把他送交人民法院法办。在事故发生后，经各方面检查讨论，认为锅炉股长张天锁对工作不负责，表现了极端粗枝大叶和麻痹现象，决定给他记大过一次。本厂领导上，平时工作不深入，麻痹大意，以致造成这次的事故，已呈请电业管理总局给予处分。
