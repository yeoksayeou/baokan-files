　　Achievements and Problems to be Solved in Beijing's Literary and Art Work in the Past Year
　　Li Bozhao
　　On the first anniversary of the liberation of Beijing, we should examine what achievements have been made in Beijing in practicing Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in 1950, and what still needs to be done. In 1950, in order to organize Beijing's literary and art work according to actual needs, the first task was to establish a leading institution for the city's literary and art work, unite Beijing's literary and art circles, and cooperate with the city's political, economic, and cultural construction. A specific policy for the city's literary and art work was decided. It took half a year for the conditions in various aspects to mature before the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's Literary and Art Department and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles were established one after another. The former uses the form of state power to manage the policies and guidelines for the city's literary and art work, while the latter is a mass research organization for Beijing's literary and art circles. Over the past year, under the leadership and assistance of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government and the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, some new gains have been made and some new problems have been discovered after overcoming various difficulties. They are brought up for discussion with comrades in the capital's literary and art circles.

　　The purpose of implementing the management of literary and art work by state power institutions is to promote, publicize, and encourage what is suggested in our Common Program: how to use New Democratic literature and art to improve the people's political and cultural awareness, and stimulate the people's patriotism and enthusiasm for participating in productive labor. The eighteen new plays staged throughout the city throughout the year: "Moscow Character", "Patriot", "Growing Up in Battle", "The White-Haired Girl", "Not a Cicada", "Red Flag Song", "Victory Train", "Production Grand Song and Dance", "Deep Friendship", "Steel Warrior", "The Thousand-Year Water River Opens Thawing", "The Enemy Without a Gun", "Breaking Through the Darkness Before Dawn", "Russian Question", "Paul Kochakin", "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang", "Peace Dove", "Voice of America", etc. More than one hundred and thirteen theoretical articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged the educational role of these works on the city's people, and appropriately criticized aspects that should be improved. A total of one hundred and six Soviet films, domestic films, and progressive films from People's Democratic countries were screened throughout the city, with two hundred and eighty-nine articles of commentary and introduction to guide Beijing audiences on what attitude to take in accepting these films. Soviet masterpieces such as "Moscow Character", "Paul Kochakin" and Soviet films, provided the people and cadres with profound ideological education and improved their artistic appreciation ability. The audience of new plays, domestic and Soviet films is increasing day by day.

　　The reform of traditional opera has developed, creating the new historical drama "General Xiang He". It is not only a model of cooperation between writers and artists, but more importantly, it has explored some new experiences in implementing the policy of "making the old serve the new." The education and training of opera artists is more systematic than before. The National Traditional Opera Work Conference further educated the artists in Beijing, clarified specific guidelines, and strengthened mutual contacts. According to the statistics of the Traditional Opera Improvement Section of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's Literary and Art Department, in 1950, there were 180 old opera repertoires popular in the city, and only 30 to 40 new repertoires adapted. The ideological tendency hindering the reform of traditional opera is anti-historical formalism. Some people mistakenly believe that: "Everyone has turned over, the stage has turned over, and must turn to history." Since the officials in history are the ruling class, they must be written as badly as possible. The peasants in history are the oppressed, so they must be told to raise flags and rebel and go to the mountains to become kings, otherwise it is not called a revolutionary viewpoint, and modern terms must be said from the mouths of historical figures. This method of adapting historical dramas is inappropriate, because the stereotyped formulaic repertoires distort history and hinder the implementation of the policy of reforming traditional opera and making the old serve the new. We have strictly criticized this anti-historical viewpoint in the reform of old operas. At the National Traditional Opera Work Conference, Comrade Chen Boda's criticism and instructions on anti-artistic formalism forcefully corrected this point ideologically. To overcome this shortcoming and make fewer mistakes, we who are enthusiastic about traditional opera work must admit that our own experience and knowledge in this area are insufficient, and we must humbly and earnestly study Chinese history, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and understand how to use a scientific attitude and analytical methods to truly study and analyze history. Where to start? We should systematically and step-by-step organize experts and professors who are well-versed in Chinese history and opera, Peking opera writers, and a wide range of artists through opera research classes, and prepare to sort out the city's opera catalog in stages and provide reliable references for the government to stipulate the repertoire. We must understand that this is a long-term and difficult scientific sorting work, and strive to achieve perfection in all three aspects: learn knowledge; sort out classical heritage and remove toxins in opera; and take care of the lives and work of more than two thousand artists in the city. Without starting from meticulous scientific work, I am afraid that shouting "making the old serve the new" one hundred or one thousand times will still not make the three hundred opera repertoires popular and performed in the city more suitable for educating the people. The reform of Ping opera has achieved new developments with the performance of "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "Sister Xianglin" by the Xin Fengxia troupe of the Capital Experimental Ping Opera Troupe, creating new styles and character images. There are fewer limitations in using Ping opera to express realistic themes. This achievement should be consolidated and developed, and Xin Fengxia and Hong Qiaolan and other troupes performing new Ping opera should be helped to systematically sort out the old Ping opera repertoires and arrange new repertoires, resolutely eliminating repertoires similar to "Little Old Ma Going to Beijing" and "Waitress" that are popular in Tianqiao, and cultivate healthy habits for people's entertainment. The new opera "Everyone is Happy" by the Public Recreation Society is a new creation and attempt by Beijing opera artists. Although the scale is not large, it is worthy of attention by opera experts. They are trying to seek new development on the basis of the reform of the city's new folk arts. It adopts popular folk tunes in a series of performances, and strives to create a popular folk operetta, which is very expressive. The spoken parts and singing absorb the advantages of folk arts. The spoken parts are clear, the singing is clear, and the opera music has many changes and is not monotonous, and should be developed.

　　As the people's living standards improve throughout the city, workers, peasants, soldiers, party and government cadres have increased demands for literature and art, so the masses demand a large number of works; another part demands the appreciation of exquisite works of art. Failure to gradually meet the demands of the masses will result in losing contact between the people's literature and art and the broad masses. Some citizens are still intoxicated with the low-level taste of "Waitress" and "Little Old Ma Going to Beijing", and the people's literature and art in the direction of workers, peasants and soldiers cannot get better development and cultivation, and the popularization movement of literature and art shows a certain degree of stagnation. And some cadres are also not satisfied with the less processed works reflecting modern life, and only watch Peking opera, and watch new plays less or not at all. This is also detrimental to the development of new people's literature and art. Changing this situation relies on two aspects of work to make the reform of opera suitable for historical requirements, and use history to educate the people. But in the new era, new figures have appeared, and in fact, many works reflecting modern life have already been produced. These works must be preserved as repertory plays that the masses are often happy to meet. It must have a certain level of processing, so as to enable the masses to receive systematic New Democratic ideology and socialist ideology education. The Common Program says that we should develop the people's film and drama industry. We have both policy provisions and a clear understanding of objective requirements. The leading departments of literary and art work should take responsibility and let go of encouraging the development of new people's film and drama industry.

　　The amount of popularization work required in the capital can be roughly calculated. Nearly 600,000 suburban farmers, nearly one million workers and their families, tens of thousands of professors, students and their families, and more than 200,000 cadres, as well as unorganized citizens, all require their own entertainment and cultural life. Here, the most specific requirements for massive popularization work and the reasonable division of labor and connection between popularization work and improvement work are put forward. At present, the need for popularization work is increasing day by day, but there are few backbones to guide popularization work. This difference must be made up by planning and training talents. Many talents have also emerged from the masses and can be cultivated. Secondly, the nature and organizational form of popularizing literary and art work should also be studied. Obviously, treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts, a handicraft-style approach cannot solve the problem. First of all, we must affirm that the nature of mass literary and art popularization work should be amateur literary and art activities. Whether it is "workshop literature and art" in factories or recreational activities in rural clubs, they engage in literature and art after work or during festivals or when participating in political movements for the purpose of entertaining and educating themselves and relieving fatigue. This kind of amateur literature and art must be suitable for their labor, lifestyle and other specific time and space conditions. Professional groups are different, objectively requiring them to be professionalized and requiring them to create more complete examples of people's literature and art, but the professional preparation conditions of professional group members are very insufficient. Those with general performance experience have not received strict artistic business training, while those who have received strict business training are not familiar with the feelings of the masses, or are less familiar with them. This requires sufficient time. Of course, any professional group must first be connected with amateur literary and art activities, as important as the relationship between fish and water. Experts and professional groups should be connected with fixed factories and rural areas. The first means of their work and creation process is to create or process the works of the masses, and discover literary and artistic talents among the masses and absorb them to be trained as experts. But if they are busy with rehearsal and performance all year round, it will be difficult for their own ideological and political study life, absorbing creative materials, studying technology, and creating images to achieve the purpose of professionalization. The development of professionalization will be hindered, and people's literature and art cannot be created to a high degree. A constant change in work attitude occurs. This should be resolved at work to overcome it.

　　The Beijing People's Art Theater has been focusing on building people's theater art. Over the past year, it has developed new operas and dramas representing the direction of workers, peasants and soldiers, introduced Soviet masterpieces, reached a certain level, united a group of new and old music and drama specialized artists and writers, and began to sort out and absorb the traditions of classical song and dance dramas, and tried to enrich the experiments of people's new song and dance dramas. Through the performance of new plays, the theater has connected with the masses in Beijing and gradually become a professional drama art group dedicated to the construction of theater art. Theater art is a new cause in the construction of New Democratic culture and art, gathering specialized talents, writers, actors, directors, music performers, band conductors, vocalists, composers, and dance workers who are dedicated to the people's drama and music cause, and creating new repertoires that the people love to hear and see. It is to practice Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in theater art, create stage images of workers, peasants and soldiers, distinguish it from the theater art in the past history, distinguish it from the feudal, imperialist, and comprador bourgeois theater art, and systematically organize and improve the achievements of the people's drama and music activities that practiced Mao Zedong's worker-peasant-soldier direction in the dispersed environment of the liberated rural areas in a planned and step-by-step manner. On the basis of today's new reality, create new repertoires, reflect the fine qualities of workers, peasants and soldiers in real life, educate the people to progress and love the motherland, truly professionalize the people's drama art, and gradually become both an art theater and an art academy.

　　The issue of the united front of the literary and art circles. In today's new environment, what should we use as the ideological basis for the unity of the literary and art circles? Of course, we must rely on the Common Program and Chairman Mao's literary and art thought.

　　Over the past year, we have achieved success in promoting Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, and have achieved certain achievements in understanding and practice. However, in terms of the degree and depth of need, it is obviously not enough, and we should continue to combine the actual situation and work hard to promote Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and the achievements of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought practice. What does this mean? That is to say, to make literary and art workers understand that practicing the literature and art of workers, peasants and soldiers must start from the real life, characters, thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants and soldiers, and give them a certain degree of processing in form. All new content works, as well as literary and art forms that express new content, have new developments and creations. It is the new content that determines the development and creation of the new form. The promotion of this achievement is equally important to those who have practiced Mao Zedong Thought and those who have not. For the former, affirm their confidence, explore and correct their defects and deficiencies, and in the new construction environment, learn more systematically about the lives of the working people, learn classical art, and learn folk art, and promote their development on the basis of the existing practice of worker-peasant-soldier literature and art. Only in this way will the arrival of the high tide of literature and art inevitably make the people's literature and art of workers, peasants and soldiers richer and more prosperous. It is especially important for the latter. No matter whether they are experts or general literary and art workers, according to their existing talents and cultivation, the things they do in the direction of workers, peasants and soldiers can be more complete. But how should he start? His beginning must start from learning the thinking in the direction of workers, peasants and soldiers, and admit that the new development of people's literature and art is successful, so that everyone can understand that to do this, one must be like the former, in what environment and under what conditions, how to make friends with workers, peasants and soldiers, be familiar with their lives, and learn their thoughts and feelings. If we do not work hard to promote the practical achievements of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and be superior to all other literature and art than workers, peasants and soldiers, then why would everyone be enthusiastic to practice it and add everyone's expertise to it? For the former, we must prevent the lack of confidence in past practice, or the failure to seek development in the new environment, stand still, carry burdens, not reach out to classical, folk, Soviet and progressive countries' literature and art, and maintain a conservative and backward attitude. We must also prevent him from looking down on the achievements of people's literature and art and not respecting this achievement and this practical method.

　　This is a little bit of experience in practicing Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in Beijing in the past year, which is provided for reference by comrades engaged in literary and art work.

　　北京市一年来文艺工作的成就和尚待解决的问题
    李伯钊
    北京解放一周年，应该检查一九五○年来实践毛泽东的文艺思想，在北京获得了什么成就，和还有什么需要去做的。一九五○年，为了把北京文艺工作，按照实际的需要，组织起来，头一件工作，就是建立全市文艺工作的领导机构，团结北京的文艺界，配合全市政治、经济、文化的各种建设。议定全市文艺工作的具体方针。整整花了半年功夫，各方面的条件才酝酿成熟，先后成立了北京市文教局文艺处和北京市文联；前者是以政权形式实行对全市文艺工作政策方针的管理，后者为京市文艺界群众性的研究组织。一年来，在中央文化部和全国文联领导与协助下，克服了种种困难，取得一些新的收获，也发现了一些新问题，提出来和首都文艺界的同志们研究。
    实行以政权机构来管理文艺工作，其目的就在提倡、宣传、鼓励我们共同纲领上所提示的，如何以新民主主义文艺来提高人民政治、文化觉悟水平，激发人民爱国主义及积极参加生产劳动的热忱。全市全年上演的十八个新剧目：《莫斯科性格》、《爱国者》、《战斗里成长》、《白毛女》、《不是蝉》、《红旗歌》、《胜利列车》、《生产大歌舞》、《深厚的友谊》、《钢铁战士》、《千年水河开了冻》、《不拿枪的敌人》、《冲破黎明前的黑暗》、《俄罗斯问题》、《保尔·柯察金》、《王贵与李香香》、《和平鸽》、《美国之音》等，在报刊杂志上，曾以一百一十三篇理论文字鼓励这些作品对全市人民的教育作用，适当的批评其应该改进的方面。全市上演苏联影片、国产影片与人民民主国家进步影片共一百零六部，有二百八十九篇评论和介绍的文章，指导北京观众拿什么态度来接受这些影片。苏联的名剧《莫斯科性格》、《保尔·柯察金》以及苏联的影片，使人民和干部得到了深刻的思想教育，提高了艺术鉴赏能力。新剧目，国产、苏联电影的观众，一天比一天的增多了。
    戏曲改革工作发展了，创造了新历史剧《将相和》，它不仅是作家与艺人合作的模范，更要紧的是贯彻“推陈出新”的方针上摸索出了一些新的经验。对戏曲艺人的教育训练，比较以往有系统。全国戏曲工作会议，更深入一步的教育了京市艺人，明确了具体方针，密切了互相间的联系。根据北京市文教局文艺处戏曲改进科的统计，一九五○年在本市流行的旧剧剧目为一百八十出，改编过的新剧目为数不过三四十出。阻碍戏曲改革的思想倾向，是反历史的公式主义，有人误以为：“大家翻身，舞台翻身，要翻到历史上去”。历史上的官，既然是统治阶级，就必须设法把他写坏些，历史上的农民，是被压迫者，就必须叫他插旗造反，上山为王，否则都不叫做革命观点，硬要从历史人物嘴里说现代名词。这种改编历史剧的方法，是不妥当的。因为千篇一律的公式主义的剧目，歪曲了历史，防害了推陈出新戏改方针的贯彻。我们对这种改革旧剧中的反历史观点，曾进行了严格的批评。在全国戏曲工作会议上，陈伯达同志关于反艺术上的公式主义的批判和指示，有力的在思想上纠正了这一点。要克服这个缺点和少犯错误，我们热心从事戏曲工作的，必须承认我们自己在这方面的经验学识不足，必须虚心地、认真地学习中国的历史，学习马列主义毛泽东思想，懂得用科学的态度，分析的方法，去真正的研究和分析历史。从何着手呢？我们应有计划、有步骤的通过戏曲研究班，团结对中国历史、戏曲研究有素的专家和教授，京剧作家，广大的艺人，分期有准备的整理全市上演的戏曲目录，作整理戏曲遗产资料的科学准备，提供政府规定剧目之可靠的参考。要懂得，这是长期的、繁难的科学整理工作，努力做到三全其美：学到学问；整理了古典遗产，改掉戏曲中的毒素；照顾到全市二千余艺人的生活与工作。不从细致的科学工作入手，只怕一百遍、一千遍的喊“推陈出新”，对全市流行上演的三百出戏曲，还是没有办法做得更加适合于教育人民的需要。评戏的改革，以首都实验评剧团新凤霞班社演出《小二黑结婚》和《祥林嫂》，得到了新的发展，创造了新的作风和人物形象，用评戏来表现现实主题限制性较少些，这成绩要巩固发展它，帮助新凤霞和鸿巧兰等演新评剧的班社，有计划的整理评剧旧剧目和编排新剧目，坚决排除天桥流行的《小老妈上京》、《女招待》类似的剧目，养成人民娱乐的健康习惯。大众游艺社的新曲戏《皆大欢喜》，是北京戏曲艺人的新创造、新尝试，规模不大，但值得研究戏曲的专家注意。他们试图从全市新曲艺改革的基础上求新发展。采用民间流行的曲牌连奏，努力创作一种民间流行的小歌剧，非常富于表现性，说白、唱腔吸取了曲艺的长处，说的清楚，唱的明白，戏曲音乐变化多，不单调，应该发展它。
    全市群众生活改善，工农兵及党政干部，对文学艺术的要求增加，因而群众要求大量作品；另一部分，则要求精致的艺术品的欣赏。不逐渐满足群众要求，则会失去人民文艺与广大群众联系。部分市民，至今还陶醉于《女招待》、《小老妈上京》的低级趣味中，工农兵方向的人民文艺，得不到更好的发育与培养，文艺普及运动呈现某种程度的停滞不前。而有些干部也因不满足于加工较少的反映现代生活的作品，而只看京剧，不看或少看新剧。这对新的人民文艺的发展，也是不利的。改变这种情况，靠两方面的工作，使戏曲改革适合历史要求，以历史来教育人民。但新的时代，出现了新的人物，事实上也已经产生了许多反映现代生活的作品，这些作品要保存下来，作为经常群众乐于见面的保留剧目。必须有一定水平的加工，借以使群众得到系统的新民主主义思想和社会主义思想的教育。共同纲领上说了，要发展人民的电影、戏剧事业，我们既有政策的规定，客观要求也看得很清楚，文艺工作的领导部门，应负起责任来，放手鼓励发展新的人民电影戏剧事业。
    首都文艺普及工作要求的量，大约是可以计算的，约近六十万的郊区农民，约近百万的工人及其家属，约近十数万的教授、学生及其家属和近二十余万的干部，还有无组织的市民，都要求自己的娱乐和文化生活。这里便最具体的提出了眼前普及工作大量的要求和普及工作与提高工作合理分工和联系问题。目前普及工作的需要，一天更比一天大，而指导普及工作的骨干又少，这个差额，非有计划地训练出人才来担负不可，群众中也涌现出不少人才可以培养。其次，普及文艺工作的性质与组织形式，也要加以研究。显然，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，手工业式是不能解决问题的了。先要肯定群众文艺普及工作的性质应该是业余的文艺活动，无论工厂里的“车间文艺”和农村俱乐部的文娱活动，是他们工作完了或逢节日或参加政治运动，才闹文艺，以娱乐教育自己，解除疲劳为目的。这种业余文艺，必须适合他们的劳作，生活方式和其他种种具体时间、空间的条件。专业团体就不同，客观要求他专业化，要求它更完整的创作人民文艺的典型，但专业团体成员的专业化的准备条件是很不够的，一般的富有表演经验者未曾受过艺术业务严格训练，而受过严格业务训练者，对于群众生活感情又不熟悉，或少熟悉，这就需要充分的时间。当然，任何专业团体，首先，必须要和业余文艺活动发生联系，像鱼同水的关系一样重要。专家和专业团体，都应该联系固定的工厂和农村，其工作的手段和创作过程，第一是创作或加工群众的作品，并发现群众中文艺工作的天才，吸收培养成为专家。但他们终年的忙于排演、表演，则其本身的思想政治学习生活、吸取创作素材、钻研技术、创造形象，就难于达到专业化的目的了。文艺工作普及与提高之间不但有密切的联系，而且也应有适当的分工，不是分家。这样才能使专业团体的成员，不致工作十余年后没有时候学习整理，其政治艺术水平，仍与十余年前差不多，既达不到专业化，也创造不出人民文艺的典范，不断发生改行思想。应该在工作上加以解决，才能克服。
    北京人民艺术剧院，专心致力于建设人民剧场艺术，一年来，发展了代表工农兵方向的新歌剧、话剧，介绍苏联名著，达到了一定的水平，团结了一批新旧音乐和戏剧专门艺术家和作家，开始整理和吸收古典歌舞剧的传统，试作丰富人民新歌舞剧的实验。剧院通过新剧目的演出，联系了北京群众，逐渐成为专业化的戏剧艺术团体，致力于剧场艺术建设。剧场艺术，是新民主主义文化艺术建设中的新事业，集合有志于人民戏剧、音乐事业的专门人才、作家、演员、导演、音乐演奏员、乐队指挥、声乐家、作曲家、舞蹈工作者、舞台美术工作者，创造人民喜闻乐见的新剧目。它是在剧场艺术中来实践毛泽东的文艺思想，创造工农兵的舞台形象，区别于已往历史上的剧场艺术，区别于封建的、帝国主义的、买办资产阶级的剧场艺术，有计划有步骤地把解放区农村分散环境中实践毛泽东工农兵方向有成就的人民戏剧、音乐活动的成果组织起来，加以系统整理和提高。在今天新的现实基础之上，创造新剧目，反映现实生活中工农兵的优良品质，教育人民进步和热爱祖国，真正使人民的戏剧艺术专业化，逐渐做到既是艺术剧院，又是艺术学院。
    文艺界的统一战线问题，在今天新的环境下，我们以什么作为文艺界团结的思想基础呢？当然是要依靠共同纲领和毛主席的文艺思想。
    一年来，我们宣传毛泽东文艺思想有成绩，在认识上，实践上达到了一定的成就。但按需要的程度和深度来说，显然是不够的，还应该结合实际情况努力宣传毛泽东文艺思想及毛泽东文艺思想实践的成果。这是什么意思呢？就是说，使文艺工作者理解实践工农兵的文艺，必然是从工农兵的现实生活、人物、思想、感情出发，并从形式上给以一定的加工。凡新内容的作品，以及表现新内容的文艺形式，是有了新的发展和创造的。是新内容决定了新形式的发展和创造。这种成果的宣传，对于实践过毛泽东思想的人，及尚未实践过的人同样重要。对头一种人，肯定其信心，发掘并改正其缺陷与不足，在新的建设环境中，更有系统的学习劳动人民生活，学习古典艺术，学习民间艺术，促其在已有实践工农兵文艺的基础上发展。只有这样做，则文艺高潮的到来，必然会使工农兵的人民文艺，更加丰富，更加繁荣。对后一种人说来，尤其重要，无论是专家或一般文艺工作者，按其现有才能和修养，他实践工农兵方向做出来的东西，可以更完整。但他怎么开头起始呢？他的开头，必需从学习工农兵方向的思想，承认人民文艺的新发展，有成就，这样才能使大家懂得要做这个，必需和头一种人一样，在什么环境，什么条件下，如何去同工农兵交朋友，熟悉其生活，学习其思想感情，如果不努力宣传毛泽东文艺思想实践成果，优于非工农兵的其他一切文艺，那么大家为什么会热心来实践，并把大家的专长加入进来呢？对头一种人，要防止对过去实践无信心，或到新的环境下不求发展，固步自封，背包袱，对古典的，民间的，对苏联及进步国家的文艺不伸手，保守落后的态度。也要防止他看不起人民文艺的成果，不尊重这个成果和这种实践的方法。
    这是一年来北京实践毛泽东文艺思想的一点心得，提供从事文艺工作的同志们参考。
