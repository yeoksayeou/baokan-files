Developing Production, Improving Life
　  An Introduction to Eleven Production Model Villages in Shanxi Province
　　Wu Guangtang
    At the first Shanxi Provincial Congress of Model Workers in Industry and Agriculture, eleven production model villages were selected: Xigou, Chuandi, and Jiebankao in Pingshun County; Yuanzhuang in Lingchuan County; Huojia Yao in Licheng County; Yaoshanggou in Wuxiang County; Dazhai in Yushe County; Zhangba in Zuoquan County; Baijiagou in Xing County; Baiyangyu in Xiyang County; and Sanjiaohe (livestock farming model village). Production in all of these model villages has greatly increased, and the lives of the farmers have been significantly improved. They have provided many experiences in production and leadership, pointing out a path of "developing production, improving life" for the farmers. The ten production model villages have a total of 1,130 households (excluding the livestock farming model village of Sanjiaohe). Before the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937), they had a total of 13,379 mu of land, which has now increased to 15,873 mu (1950), an expansion of 18.6 percent in cultivated land. The expansion was mainly achieved through reclaiming wasteland and river滩. Huojia Yao alone reclaimed more than 800 mu, and Baiyangyu reclaimed 320 mu of river滩. The average yield per mu has increased from 9.9 dou before the war to 1.54 shi now, exceeding the pre-war level by 55.7 percent. The total output has increased from 13,234 shi before the war to 24,495 shi now, exceeding the pre-war level by 85 percent. The number of draft animals has increased from 537 before the war to 1,054 now, exceeding the pre-war level by 96 percent. The number of sheep has increased from 425 before the war to 4,186 now, approaching the pre-war level, with seven villages including Xigou exceeding the pre-war level. The number of farm implements has increased from 1,304 before the war to 5,472 now, exceeding the pre-war level by 321 percent. Hog raising has reached a level of one hog for every three households. The speed of production recovery after suffering severe damage from the enemy is astonishing.
    The farmers in the above eleven production model villages all suffered the same fate before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Most of the good land was owned by landlords and rich peasants, while they lived a very miserable life. Before the war, Dazhai Village had a total of 876 mu of land, of which 600 mu belonged to landlords. Apart from two rich peasant households farming 90 mu, more than 30 poor peasant households only had just over 180 mu of medium-to-low-quality land. Before the war, 73 out of 80 households in Baiyangyu rented land from landlords. In Xigou, after paying rent to the landlords, the farmers had an average of only 1.6 dou of coarse grain left per person per year. Insufficient food and clothing and living on chaff and vegetables for half the year were common occurrences. Now, everything has completely changed. The farmers have become the masters of the land. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they launched a production movement, and production greatly increased. All the harvests belonged to the farmers, and with the addition of sideline occupations, a farmer's income was three, four, or even five times higher than before the war. Of the 20 households in Xigou, 8 had a surplus of 20% after cultivation and 11 had a surplus of 30%. The village had a total of 130 shi of grain in storage. Of the 53 households in Dazhai, 24 had 330 shi of grain in storage. Of the 104 households in Baiyangyu, 33 had a surplus of 100% after cultivation and 59 had a surplus of 50%. Farmers in Huojia Yao saw their income from land alone increase fivefold. They described their lives as: "Golden Queen corn for breakfast, 169 wheat for lunch, and crystal noodles for dinner." The houses in the nine villages (excluding Dazhai) totaled 3,342 rooms before the war. After the enemy's burning and destruction, only 1,893 rooms remained in 1943. Now, they have been restored to 3,004 rooms (except for Yao). The number of houses in Yuanzhuang and three other villages has increased compared to before the war.
    After the material lives of the farmers in the production model villages improved, they paid great attention to their children's education and were very active in cultural literacy programs for young people. Before the war, only seven children of rich peasants in Dazhai were literate. But in 1947, they started the first elementary school that the village had ever had. Twenty-eight children enrolled, and ten young people joined cultural literacy classes, with twelve participating in people's schools. In the precious village of Huojia Yao, only one person was literate before the war. Now, there are seven people with college degrees who work as teachers, ten people who can write news reports for newspapers, twenty-one people who are rudimentarily literate, and twenty-nine people who have learned abacus. More than half of the village's population participates in learning.
    Social welfare undertakings have also begun. Jiebankao used income from land reclamation to establish a public granary, and Dazhai and Baiyangyu set up credit cooperatives. In addition, collective land reclamation and afforestation, larger production and construction projects, and the procurement of production and living equipment are even more common.
    Sanjiaohe is a livestock farming model village with a total of 115 households. Under the leadership of model worker Zhang Laotai, it has become a new village where "every family raises livestock and every household has surplus grain." The number of livestock has increased from 27 to 124. The number of pigs has increased from 10 to 82, and the number of sheep has increased from 340 to 1,400. There are plans to increase the sheep herd every year. There is also planned cultivation of pasture grass and development of pastures. Sanjiaohe has transformed from a poor mountain village into a rich pastureland. It is precisely because of the development of animal husbandry that fertilizer has increased, and agricultural production has also greatly improved. The corn yields of Zhang Laotai and Li Hengsheng exceeded the expected yield by five times, and the entire village exceeded the expected yield. As a result, the lives of the farmers have also improved accordingly. Last year, on average, three households slaughtered one sheep and four households slaughtered one pig. The improvement in the lives of the farmers is imaginable. Sanjiaohe's experience in combining agriculture and animal husbandry is indeed a model for the prosperity of farmers in mountainous areas.
    The eleven production model villages have transformed from poverty to prosperity, demonstrating the new atmosphere of the New Democratic countryside. These villages are currently in the minority, but the conditions for promoting their experiences and cultivating more production model villages are fully in place. Their experiences are described below:
    First, the common experience of the production model villages is to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's path of organizing to develop production. They started mutual aid as early as 1943 and 1944, and the mutual aid teams have a history of seven or eight years. According to 1950 statistics, the number of households organized in the ten villages accounts for 95 percent. In fact, almost 100 percent of the labor force participated in the mutual aid teams, except for some households of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers with no labor power, orphans and widows, and individuals with special reasons. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was a severe shortage of labor and draft animals. Organization began under the demand of the masses to overcome difficulties, and organization did indeed solve this serious problem. Organization achieved the rational use of labor, and brought the role of semi- and auxiliary labor, especially female labor, into play. Women participated in agricultural production at a rate of over 90 percent. Labor and animal power exchange were also widely adopted. This greatly increased agricultural productivity, not only overcoming the serious difficulties at the time, but also making intensive farming possible. In terms of fertilization, the ten villages averaged 75 dan per mu, more than doubling the pre-war level. Five villages—Chuandi, Yaoshanggou, Dazhai, Zhangba, and Baijiagou—cultivated 100 percent of their land three times. Xigou and Jiebankao cultivated 70 to 50 percent of their land three times, and the rest cultivated it twice. The other villages all cultivated more than twice. Chuandi, Yuanzhuang, Dazhai, and Zhangba cultivated all of their land three times, and more than 20 percent of it four times. Before the war, Chuandi used nine labor days per mu. In 1945, it used twelve labor days per mu. In 1950, the entire village averaged 18.5 labor days per mu, thereby increasing production. The brilliant achievements and historical path of development of the ten production model villages, as well as their common experiences, fully demonstrate the superiority of organization. Organization is indeed "the only way to transform from poverty to prosperity."
    Second, the second common experience of the production model villages is that they all attach great importance to improving agricultural technology. The masses have personally experienced that in order to continuously improve production after it has been restored, it is necessary to improve production technology. The technical guidance committee, centered on experienced old farmers, has become the most popular organization among the masses, effectively guiding production. Guo Yu'en, a model worker in Chuandi, served as the deputy leader of the mutual aid team and formed a technical committee, unifying mutual aid team leadership and technical guidance. They all paid attention to studying and improving farming methods, adjusting the soil, repairing farmland, and improving fertilization and fertilizer management techniques. Seed selection and exchange were also widely carried out. In Xigou Village, 50 percent of the seeds were exchanged from other villages in 1950. 75 percent of the grain and corn in Yuanzhuang were also exchanged. They were also extremely active in adopting new scientific technologies. The ten villages used hot water soaking and chemical seed treatment for an average of 80 percent of their seeds, basically eliminating smut and bunt diseases. They also paid great attention to using scientific chemicals to kill insects and introducing high-quality varieties from outside. Xigou and Dazhai started introducing Golden Queen corn and 169 wheat in 1948. Improving farm implements and promoting the use of new-style farm implements are also important tasks for the production model villages. Xigou Village started testing two-legged seed drills in 1948. In 1950, it bought single-handle plows, liberation-style weeding hoes, and sprayers for testing. Dazhai Village used improved single-person sowing plows. The entire village of Yuanzhuang converted to 15 double-legged seed drills, 9 adjustable seed drills, 9 three-wheel plows, and 63 hook hoes. It is precisely because they attached importance to the improvement of agricultural production technology, especially the adoption of new scientific technologies, that production was able to continue to improve on the basis of already having been restored to pre-war levels. At the same time, the farmers in the model villages also realized a truth, that the improvement of technology, especially the adoption of new scientific technologies, can only fully play its role on the basis of organization. They fully understand that extremely scattered, individual household production cannot create more favorable production conditions, adopt scientific technologies, or undertake larger construction projects. The experience of the production model villages also proves that the masses have developed collective wisdom and creativity on the basis of organization. Production has continuously improved, and the farmers' technical level has also continuously increased, gradually overcoming the farmers' consistently conservative and backward production methods. Therefore, the farmers personally experienced that organization is powerful, organization creates more methods, and organization makes every family rich and the whole village rich. It is precisely because organization is closely combined with the improvement of technology that mutual aid teams have increased in new content, production has continued to improve, and mutual aid teams have become more consolidated and expanded to the entire village, persisting for as long as seven or eight years. This is the internal factor that organization must be combined with technological improvement, and it is also the correct direction for further improving production.
    Third, adapting to local conditions and combining sideline occupations to create production conditions is the third important experience of the production model villages. Li Shunda's "transforming poor gullies into rich gullies," Yang Fengshan's "transforming barren mountains into treasure mountains," and Zhang Laotai's "transforming poor mountain villages into rich pasturelands" all developed in accordance with local conditions and production conditions. Xigou and Jiebankao reclaimed land to grow codonopsis pilosula, earning 180 shi, equivalent to 50 percent of the two villages' land grain income. Under the leadership of Jia Baozhi, Baijiagou organized cooperatives to carry out agricultural and sideline production. Each laborer earned more than 10 shi of grain from sideline occupations alone. On the basis of organizing the entire village with surplus labor, Yuanzhuang organized carrying and transportation, organized blacksmith shops to make and sell farm implements, and in the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950, the income from sideline occupations was equal to 12 percent of agricultural income. Raising pigs and chickens was even more common. Afforestation, especially the cultivation of fruit trees, was also an important long-term construction task for the production model villages. Under the leadership of Yang Fengshan, Jiebankao collectively purchased mountain gullies. In addition to reclaiming land for farming, in 1950 alone, the entire administrative village planted a total of 8,566 production trees and 6,064 timber trees, an average of 22 trees planted per person. In 1949 and 1950, Sanjiaohe planted trees on 220 mu of land and closed off more than 1,000 mu of mountains for afforestation. Xigou also afforested 175 mu, and Yuanzhuang afforested 15 mu, planting 600 trees. Home-based sideline production can not only make full use of surplus labor during the agricultural slack season, but also is an indispensable part of agricultural production, and sideline income accounts for a large proportion of farmers' lives, which is necessary for farmers to become prosperous. Therefore, on the basis of organization, combining agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year, making full use of various natural conditions, and vigorously developing promising and marketable sideline handicrafts is still very necessary.
    Fourth, labor models taking the lead, setting examples, and leading the masses forward is the fourth important experience of the production development of the model villages. All eleven villages have outstanding labor models. Li Shunda of Xigou, Zhang Zhiquan of Dazhai, Guo Yu'en of Chuandi, Jia Baozhi of Baijiagou, Zhang Laotai of Sanjiaohe, and Shi Cunjin of Huojia Yao have all attended the district-level labor model conferences in the Xing Shu area once or twice and have been selected as first-class or second-class labor models. In the past, they were all tenant farmers (such as Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan), hired workers (such as Wang Jinyun), shepherds (such as Zhang Laotai), or refugees who had fled from famine. They turned themselves around in rent reduction and interest rate reduction and land reform, and the laboring people became masters, increasing their enthusiasm for production. Model figures supported by the masses emerged from the production movement. Relying on them promoted production. Huojia Yao of the labor model Shi Cunjin already had 36 labor models and production activists in 1946. In 1950, the entire village also selected 27 labor models, with 9 attending the county labor model conference. Yuanzhuang, from the labor model Lian Quanbao, launched mass labor model selection campaigns in every production season in 1950. After spring sowing, the entire village selected 94 labor model activists, which increased to 138 after weeding, and a total of 163 were selected after the year-end summary in the autumn. The experience of the production model villages proves that launching the mass heroism, organizing mass production appraisal competitions with labor models as the core, is a good leadership method for promoting the production movement by following the mass line.
    Fifth, improving the work style of cadres and strengthening production leadership is the fifth important experience of the production model villages. The labor models from the eleven villages who attended the provincial labor model conference were all Communist Party members, and five were branch secretaries and two were branch committee members. They were the main cadres in the villages and also labor models. They always did things themselves first, carried out demonstration education for the masses, and then organized the masses to act together. This is a good experience in leading production through production. The facts of the production model villages powerfully criticize the erroneous views of some cadres who "fear delaying their own production and give up leadership" or say "if you want to lead production, you cannot take the lead in production." The democratic work style and the mass line work method are the common characteristics of the cadres in the production model villages. Production plans and appraisal summaries are all carried out through the people's representative conference, bringing the strength of various systems into play and achieving division of labor and responsibility and district leadership. Because the leadership style is democratic, it also guarantees the unity of all village cadres and labor models, and guarantees the smooth development of the production movement.
    In addition, formulating production and wealth-building plans is also very important. Li Shunda's five-year production plan in Xigou, Wang Jinyun's three-year construction plan in Yaoshanggou, and Zhang Laotai's livestock development plan not only specifically stipulate the goals of production development and the guaranteeing methods, but also point out the bright future lives of farmers after production development. This is of great use in overcoming the blindness of production and inspiring the masses' strong production enthusiasm.
    In short, organization, technology improvement, agriculture and sideline combination, labor model leadership, and strengthened leadership are the specific experiences of production development and improved living standards in the production model villages. The Shanxi Provincial Government has formally stipulated requirements to promote these experiences and cultivate more model villages, requiring each old liberated area to cultivate a model village in each administrative district and each new area to cultivate a model village in each county.

　　发展生产，改善生活的道路
　  山西省十一个生产模范村介绍
　　武光汤
    山西省首届全省工农业生产劳动大会，共评选了十一个生产模范村，计为平顺之西沟、川底、界畔峧，陵川之原庄，黎城之霍家窑，武乡之窰上沟，榆社之大寨，左权之丈八，兴县之白家沟，昔阳之白羊峪，三教河（畜牧模范村）。上述生产模范村全村的生产均有很大提高，农民生活亦有相当改善。它们提供了不少生产与领导生产的经验，给农民指出了一条“发展生产，改善生活”的道路。十个生产模范村，共计一千一百三十户（畜牧模范三教河未计），抗战以前（一九三七年）共有土地一三三七九亩，现在（一九五○年）一五八七三亩，耕地面积扩大了百分之十八点六。扩大的办法主要是开荒成滩，仅霍家窰一村即开荒八百余亩，白羊峪开河滩三百二十亩。每亩平均产量，战前九斗九升，现在一石五斗四升，超过战前百分之五十五点七。总产量战前共一三二三四石，现在二四四九五石，超过战前百分之八十五。耕畜战前五三七头，现在一○五四头，超过战前百分之九十六。羊群战前四二五一只，现在四一八六只，也接近了战前水平，其中西沟等七村已超过战前。农具战前一三○四件，现在五四七二件，超过战前百分之三二一。养猪已达三户一猪。在遭受敌人严重破坏之后，生产恢复的速度是惊人的。
    上述十一个生产模范村农民，在抗日战争以前都遭受着完全相同的命运。大部好地均为地主富农所有，他们却过着非常悲惨的生活。大寨村战前共有土地八七六亩，即有六百亩是属于地主所有，除两户富农种地九十亩外，三十余户中贫农，仅有一百八十余亩中等以下的地。白羊峪战前八十户就有七十三户租种地主的土地。西沟农民每年除给地主交租外，每人平均仅余一石六斗粗粮，少吃无穿，糠菜半年粮是普遍的现象。现在却完全变了样，农民成了土地的主人，远在抗日战争期间即开展了生产运动，生产大大提高，收获全部归农民所有，再加上副业，一个农民的收入即三倍四倍甚至五倍于战前。西沟共二十户，耕二余一者八户，耕三余一者十一户，全村存粮一百三十石；大寨有五十三户，二十四户即存粮三百三十石；白羊峪一○四户，耕一余一者三十三户，耕二余一者五十九户；霍家窰农民收入仅土地一项即提高了五倍，农民们自己描写他们的生活是：“早上一顿金皇后，午上一顿一六九，晚上喝的玻璃莠。”房屋，九个村（大寨未计）战前共三三四二间，经过敌人的焚毁破坏，到一九四三年仅留下一八九三间，现在已恢复到三○○四间（窰除外）；原庄等四村，已较战前增多。
    生产模范村农民们物质生活改善后，都十分重视子弟的入学，对青年人的文化补习亦非常积极。大寨战前只有七个富农子弟识字，但在一九四七年即开始创办了他村从来没有过的一座小学，二十八个儿童入了学，十个青年参加了文化补习班，十二人参加了民校。霍家窑石寸金的村子，战前只有一个认识字的人，现在已有高校程度和当教员的七人，能给报纸写通讯的十人，粗通文字的二十一人，学会珠算的二十九人，参加学习的占全村人口半数以上。
    社会福利事业，亦已开始创办，界畔峧以开荒收入，抽集基金建立义仓，大寨、白羊峪、举办信贷社，此外集体开荒造林，举办较大生产建设，置办生产生活用具等更属普遍。
    三教河是畜牧模范村，共一百一十五户，在劳模张老太的领导下，已变成“家家养牲畜、户户有余粮”的新村，牲畜由二十七头，增到一二四头。猪由十口增到八十二口，羊由三四○只增到一四○○只。并计划今后每年增加一群羊。有计划的培植牧草，开辟牧场。三教河已由穷山沟变成了富牧场。也正是由于牧畜事业的发展，肥料增加，农业生产也有很大提高。张老太、李恒生的玉茭超过应产量五倍，全村都超过了应产量。因之农民生活，也随之改善，去年年关，全村平均三户杀一只羊，四户杀一口猪，农民生活的改善可以想见。三教河农牧结合的经验，确是山地农民富裕的榜样。
    十一个生产模范村，由贫困走上了富裕，表现了新民主主义农村的新气象。这些村子目前还是少数，但推广它们的经验，培养更多的生产模范村的条件是完全具备的。兹将它们的经验分述如下：
    第一、生产模范村的共同经验是坚决地走毛主席组织起来发展生产的道路。它们从一九四三年、一九四四年即开始互助，互助组均具有七、八年的历史。按一九五○年统计，十个村组织起来的户数占百分之九十五，实际上除部分无劳力的烈军工属，孤寡户及个别有特殊原因者外，劳动力几乎百分之百地参加了互助组。抗日战争中劳畜力非常缺乏，在群众要求克服困难的情况下开始组织起来，而组织起来也确实解决了这一严重的问题。组织起来做到了劳力的合理使用，发挥了半、辅劳力特别是妇女劳力的作用，妇女参加农业生产，达百分之九十以上。劳力和畜力变工亦广泛采用。这就大大地提高了农业生产力，不只克服了当时的严重困难，也使土地的精耕细作成为可能。施肥方面，十村平均每亩达七十五担，超过战前一倍以上。耕地百分之百耕三遍者有川底、窰上沟、大寨、丈八、白家沟五村。百分之七十到五十耕三遍，其余耕两遍的有西沟、界畔峧，其他各村均在二遍以上。川底、原庄、大寨、丈八作到全部中耕三遍，并有百分之二十以上中耕四遍。川底战前每亩地用工九个，一九四五年每亩用工十二个，一九五○年全村平均每亩用工已达十八个半，因而提高了生产。十个生产模范村的辉煌成就与发展的历史道路，以及他们的共同经验，充分地证明了组织起来的优越性。组织起来，确实是“由贫变富的必由之路”。
    第二、生产模范村的第二个共同经验是他们都十分重视改良农业技术。群众亲身体验到，在生产已经恢复的情况下要继续不断地提高生产，必须改进生产技术。以技术老农为中心的技术指导委员会，已成为群众最拥护的实际上对生产起指导作用的组织。川底劳模郭玉恩以技术老农担任互助组副组长，并以之组成技术委员会，使互助组领导与技术指导统一起来。他们都注意研究改良耕作方法，调剂土壤，修整耕地，改进施肥积肥技术与肥料管理技术。选种换种亦普遍进行。西沟村一九五○年有百分之五十到外村换种。原庄谷、玉茭亦有百分之七十五经过换种。对于采用新的科学技术，亦异常积极；十村温汤浸种与药剂拌种平均达百分之八十，基本上消灭了黑穗病与白发病，使用科学药剂杀虫，引种外来优良品种，亦都十分重视，西沟、大寨在一九四八年即开始引种金皇后玉茭、一六九小麦。改良农具，推广使用新式农具亦为生产模范村的重要课题，西沟村一九四八年即开始试用两腿耧，一九五○年又买回单把犁、解放式耘锄、喷雾器试用，大寨村使用了改良单人播种犁。原庄全村共改用双腿耧十五张，活耧九张，三轮犁九张，钩锄六十三张，正是因为重视了农业生产技术的改良，特别是新的科学技术的采用，产量才能在已经恢复到战前水平的基础上继续提高。同时模范村的农民们也体会到一条真理，即技术的改良特别是新的科学技术的采用。只有在组织起来的基础上，才能充分发挥作用，他们十分了解，极端的分散的一家一户的进行生产，是不能够创造更有利的生产条件、采用科学技术与举办较大建设的。生产模范村的经验也证明了群众在组织起来的基础上，发扬了集体智慧与创造能力，生产不断地提高，农民们的技术水平也不断地在增长，逐渐的克服着农民一向保守的落后的生产方式。因此农民亲身体验到组织起来力量大，组织起来大家办法多，组织起来家家富全村富。也正是因为组织起来，紧密地结合了改良技术，使互助组增加了新的内容，生产继续不断地提高，互助组也更加巩固，并扩大到全村，一直坚持到七、八年之久，这就是组织起来必须与改良技术相结合的内在因素，也是进一步提高生产的正确方向。
    第三、因地制宜结合副业，创造生产条件，是生产模范村的第三个重要经验。李顺达的“穷沟变富沟”，杨峰山的“荒山变宝山”，张老太的“穷山沟变成富牧场”，都是适应了当地的具体情况，与生产条件发展起来的。西沟、界畔峧开荒种党参，收入一百八十石，等于该两村土地粮食收入的百分之五十。白家沟在贾宝执领导下组织合作社，进行农副业结合的生产，每个劳力仅副业收入即达粮食十余石。原庄在全村组织起来有剩余劳力的基础上组织担挑、运输，组织铁匠炉打卖农具，在一九四九年冬季及一九五○年春季副业收入等于农业收入的百分之十二。养猪喂鸡更普遍，植树造林特别是培养果树，也是生产模范村长期建设的重要工作：界畔峧在杨峰山领导下集体购买山沟除开荒种地外，仅一九五○年全行政村共植生产树八五六六株，木材树六○六四株，全村每人平均植树二十二株。三教河在一九四九、一九五○两年内，播种造林二二○亩，封山育林一千余亩，西沟亦造林一七五亩，原庄造林十五亩，植树六百株。农家副业生产，一方面可以充分运用农闲季节的剩余劳力，同时亦为农业生产不可缺少的部分，且副业收入在农民生活中亦占很大比重，为农民富裕所必需。因之在组织起来的基础上，农副业结合贯串全年，充分利用各种自然情况，创造各种生产条件，大量发展有前途有销路的副业手工业，还是十分必要的。
    第四、劳动模范带头，树立榜样，带领群众前进，是生产模范村生产发展的第四个重要经验。十一个村均有杰出的劳动模范。西沟李顺达，大寨张志全，川底郭玉恩，白家沟贾宝执，三教河张老太，霍家窰石寸金，都是曾经一次或两次出席过行署区的全区劳模大会，被选为一等或二等劳动模范。他们在过去都是佃户（如李顺达、张志全等）、雇工（如王锦云）、羊工（如张老太）或逃荒的难民出身的，在减租减息、土地改革中翻了身，劳动人民变成主人，生产积极性提高了，从生产运动中涌现出群众拥护的模范人物。又依靠他们推动了生产。劳动模范石寸金的霍家窰，在一九四六年即有劳动模范与生产积极分子三十六名，一九五○年全村亦评选劳动模范二十七名，出席县劳动模范大会者即九名；劳动模范连全保的原庄在一九五○年每个生产季节，均进行群众性的评选劳动模范运动；春季下种后，全村评选出劳动模范积极分子九十四人，锄苗后评选增为一百三十八人，秋后全年总结共评选一百六十三人。生产模范村的经验证明，发动群众的新英雄主义，以劳动模范为核心，组织群众性的生产评比竞赛，对于推动生产运动是很好的走群众路线的领导方法。
    第五、改善干部作风，加强生产领导，是生产模范村的第五个重要经验。十一个村出席全省劳模大会的劳动模范均是共产党员，并有五个是支部书记，两个是支委，他们是村中的主要干部，又是劳动模范，凡事自己先干，对群众进行示范教育，然后组织群众一起行动。这是以生产领导生产的很好经验。有些干部“怕耽误自己生产放弃领导”，或者说“要领导生产，就不能在生产上起带头”的错误观点，生产模范村的事实，给予了有力的批判。窰上沟王锦云几年来积极领导群众生产，工作做的好，自己的生产也搞的好，他的经验是：“只要有计划，抓紧生产时间，什么都做在群众头里，也不会误了自己的营生”。民主作风与群众路线的工作方法是生产模范村干部的共同特点。生产计划与评比总结都是通过人民代表会来进行的，发挥了各系统的力量，作到了分工负责，分片领导。由于领导作风民主，因而也保证了全村干部、劳动模范的团结，保证了生产运动的顺利开展。
    此外，拟订生产发家计划，也很重要。西沟李顺达的五年生产计划，窰上沟王锦云的三年建设计划，以及张老太的畜牧发展计划等，他们不只具体规定了生产发展的目标与保证的办法，同时也指出了农民生产发展后未来的美满生活，这对于克服生产的盲目性，鼓舞群众旺盛的生产情绪是有很大作用的。
    总之，组织起来，改良技术，农副结合，劳模带头，加强领导，是生产模范村生产发展生活改善的具体经验。推广这些经验，培养更多的模范村，山西省府已有正式规定，要求老区每个行政区培养一个模范村，新区每县培养一个模范村。
