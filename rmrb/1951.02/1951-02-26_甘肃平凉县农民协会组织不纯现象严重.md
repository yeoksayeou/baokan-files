　　Serious Impurities in the Farmers' Association Organization in Pingliang County, Gansu
    To the Editor:
    Most of the district and township Farmers' Associations in Pingliang County were established during the autumn grain requisition work in 1949. Some Farmers' Associations were rectified during the summer grain requisition in 1950. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently six district Farmers' Associations, fifty-five township Farmers' Associations, and two hundred and twenty-five Farmers' Association groups established throughout the county, with a total of two thousand three hundred and forty-seven members (including three hundred and sixty-five Hui people, accounting for 1.6 percent of the county's total population).
    The shortcomings of the Farmers' Associations at all levels in Pingliang are, first and foremost, the unsoundness of the leading bodies and the fact that the organization of some Farmers' Associations is merely a formality. For example, the county Farmers' Association has no one specifically in charge. Some township Farmers' Association directors are unwilling to work and do not take care of matters. For example, Ma Jinshan, the director of the Fourth Township Farmers' Association in Wu'an District, doesn't even know he is the director of the Farmers' Association. The First Township Farmers' Association in Shizi District has only a director, a deputy director, and one representative, without any committee members or members.
    The unsoundness of the Farmers' Association organization is inseparable from the improper methods of developing the organization. According to the district Farmers' Association directors, four methods were adopted when mobilizing the masses to establish Farmers' Associations last year: (1) In Baishui District, a farmers' representative meeting was held first to elect committee members and establish a township Farmers' Association preparatory committee, and then members were developed. This approach was correct. (2) In Kongtong District, the district designated the township Farmers' Association director, and the township designated the committee members, and then the masses elected the members. (3) The Farmers' Association cadres and members were all elected by the masses. For example, Shizi District stipulated that each township should elect one director, one deputy director, and one representative, and each natural village should elect two members. A total of one hundred and eight members were elected from the eight townships in the district. (4) In individual townships (such as the Third Township of Wu'an), a roster was created from the register of the entire township's poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants and reported to the district, which was then considered the establishment of the Farmers' Association.
    The second shortcoming of the Farmers' Associations in Pingliang districts and townships is the impurity of the organization. In some Farmers' Associations in Baishui, Huasuo, and other districts, landlords, rich peasants, and their agents have infiltrated and have already usurped the leadership of the Farmers' Association. In the seven Farmers' Associations in the Seventh Township of Baishui District, five of the committee members were former puppet保长 [village heads]; Li Mao, a committee member of the Third Township Farmers' Association in Wu'an, participated in the plainclothes team of the former puppet Pingliang Special Commissioner's Office; Lan Changwei, the director of the Third Township Farmers' Association in Anding District, was a special agent. After infiltrating the Farmers' Association, he lured and coerced twenty-two backward peasants to rebel in May of last year.
    The third shortcoming of the Farmers' Associations in Pingliang districts and townships is that a portion of the Farmers' Associations universally exhibits illegal phenomena such as beating, cursing, and arbitrarily fining people in their work style. In Baishui District, six out of nine townships' Farmers' Associations have had incidents of tying, binding, beating, detaining, and arbitrarily fining people. The Farmers' Association of the Seventh Township bound and beat people when mediating disputes. Zhu Zhihua, the director of the Farmers' Association, fined the defendant two dou of wheat and the plaintiff one bag of coal when mediating disputes; and took over twenty mu of land leased by the peasants from the landlords for his own cultivation. The township head and the director of the Farmers' Association of the Fifth Township of Anguo District forced a widow to pay a "crossing village fee" of two shi and five dou of wheat, one writing brush, and three knives of straw paper when she remarried. The township head and the director of the Farmers' Association of the Fifth Township of Anding District embezzled thirty-nine shi of public grain.

    Editor's Note: Pingliang County, Gansu Province, is an area where land reform has not yet been carried out. The chaotic state of the organization of the district and township Farmers' Associations in the county should be rectified step by step in accordance with the "General Principles of Farmers' Associations" to make the necessary organizational preparations for the upcoming land reform movement.
    First, the Farmers' Association is a mass organization voluntarily formed by farmers. In areas where Farmers' Associations have not yet been established, the local people's government should convene a temporary farmers' representative meeting to elect committee members and form a Farmers' Association preparatory committee in order to perform the tasks of the Farmers' Association committee before the formal convening of the farmers' representative meeting for election. Therefore, the method of developing organizations in most district and township Farmers' Associations in the county is incorrect.
    Second, since the Farmers' Association is an organization that protects the interests of farmers, it is necessary to strictly prohibit the infiltration of non-farmer elements into the Farmers' Association. In some district and township Farmers' Associations in the county, not only is the organization impure, but the leadership has been usurped by landlords and unscrupulous elements. This serious phenomenon must be given attention. For those with impure organizations, cleaning up and rectification should be carried out; for those with impure leading bodies, the masses should be mobilized to hold re-elections.
    Third, the issue of rectifying the work style of Farmers' Association cadres should also be given considerable importance in the county. Phenomena such as beating, cursing, and penalties must not be allowed to continue.

### 甘肃平凉县农民协会组织不纯现象严重

　　甘肃平凉县农民协会组织不纯现象严重
    编辑同志：
    我们平凉县大多数的区乡农民协会都是在一九四九年秋季征粮工作中建立起来的，一九五零年夏征时曾有一部分农民协会进行过整顿。目前据不完全的统计：全县建立了六个区农民协会，五十五个乡农民协会和二百二十五个农会小组，共会员二千三百四十七人（其中有回民三百六十五人，占全县总人口的百分之一点六）。
    平凉各级农民协会存在的缺点，首先是领导机构不健全和某些农民协会的组织流于形式。如县农民协会即无专人负责。某些乡农民协会的主任自己不愿干，不管事，如武安区四乡农民协会主任马进山，自己就不知道自己是农民协会的主任。什字区一乡农民协会只有正副主任和一个代表，没有委员和会员。
    农民协会组织不健全，和发展组织的方法不当是分不开的。据各区农民协会主任们谈：在去年发动群众建立农民协会时，曾采取过四种方式：（一）白水区是先召开农民代表会，选出委员，成立乡农民协会筹备会，然后去发展会员，这种做法是对的。（二）崆峒区由区指定乡农民协会主任，由乡指定委员，然后再由群众选出会员。（三）农会干部及会员都是群众选的，如什字区规定每乡选正副主任及代表各一人，每个自然村选会员二人，全区八个乡共选了会员一百零八人。（四）个别的乡（如武安三乡），是把全乡人口登记表上的贫农、雇农和中农造成一份名册，报到区上就算成立了农民协会。
    平凉各区乡农民协会的第二个缺点，就是组织不纯。白水、花所等区部分农民协会中有地主，富农及其代理人混入，并已窃取了农民协会的领导权。白水区七乡七个农民协会的委员中，五个是过去的伪保长；武安三乡农民协会委员李茂曾参加过伪平凉专署的便衣队；安定区三乡农民协会主任兰长伟是个特务，混进农民协会后即于去年五月间拉拢威迫落后农民二十二人叛变。
    平凉各区乡农民协会的第三个缺点，就是一部分农民协会在工作作风上普遍存在打、骂和乱罚人的违法现象。白水区九个乡中有六个乡的农民协会发生过捆、绑、打、押和乱罚人的事件。七乡农民协会调解纠纷时绑人、打人，农民协会主任朱志花在调解纠纷时，罚了被告二斗麦子，罚了原告一袋煤；并把农民租种地主的二十亩地收归自己耕种。安国区五乡乡长和农民协会主任，在一个寡妇改嫁时，竟强迫她出“过庄费”麦子二石五斗，毛笔一把，麻纸三刀。安定区五乡乡长和农民协会主任曾贪污公粮三十九石。

    编者按：甘肃省平凉县是尚未进行土地改革的地区。目前该县区乡农民协会组织工作上的混乱状态，应根据“农民协会通则”有步骤地进行整顿，以便为今后的土地改革运动做好必要的组织准备工作。
    首先，农民协会是农民自愿结合的群众组织。在农民协会尚未成立的地区，得由当地人民政府召开临时农民代表会议，选出委员，组成农民协会筹备会，以便在正式召开农民代表大会进行选举以前，执行农民协会委员会的任务。因此，该县大部区乡农会在发展组织的方法上是错误的。
    其次，农民协会既是保护农民利益的组织，因此，必须严禁非农民成份的分子混入农会。该县有些区乡农民协会不仅组织不纯，且领导权已为地主及不法分子所窃取。这种严重现象必须引起重视。对组织不纯的，应进行清洗整顿；对领导机构不纯的，应发动群众进行改选。
    第三，整顿农会干部作风问题，该县亦应提到相当重要的地位。绝不允许打骂及处罚等现象继续存在。
