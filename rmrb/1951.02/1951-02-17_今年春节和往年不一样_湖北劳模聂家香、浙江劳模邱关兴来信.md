　　This Spring Festival is Different From Previous Years
　　——Letters from Hubei Model Worker Nie Jiaxiang and Zhejiang Model Worker Qiu Guanxing
            (I) Comrade Editor:
    My home is in Daijiaba, Huangmei County, Hubei. I am a farmer. During the Spring Festival, I thought about my past suffering and also about the good days that Chairman Mao brought us. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were in our village, I couldn’t settle down and enjoy a Spring Festival. All year round, we had little to eat and wear. During the Spring Festival, landlords were even more ruthless in forcing rent and debt collection. I carried fish and vegetables, going out early and returning late, selling them everywhere, but who could afford to buy them except the landlords? The year before last, the flood broke the dam, and my family of four lived on sweet potato scraps every day. At that time, there was a saying in our village: "Landlords enjoy the festival, while poor farmers suffer robbery." This saying is absolutely true.
    This year, although there was a drought and poor harvest, and there was not much grain at home, my family still harvested more than 600 jin of sweet potatoes and more than 200 jin of millet. We don’t have to worry about food, and no one is forcing rent or debt collection. This year, the fields will have a good harvest. These days will be even better. So I am very happy.
    Our lives are gradually getting better, and the atmosphere in the village is becoming more upright. There is no more gambling and senselessness. More people are learning to read and sing.

            (II) Comrade Editor:
    The Farmers' Association of our Qiujiaqiao Village (in Linpu District, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province) held a representative meeting on January 30th. At this meeting, three things were decided: (1) Everyone should work together to prevent bandits and unlawful landlords from spreading rumors and engaging in sabotage activities; (2) During the Spring Festival, we must eliminate superstition, advise farmers not to burn silver ingots and yuanbao, and not to light red candles, saving the money for production; (3) During the winter slack season, everyone should quickly discuss and formulate production plans.
    During the Spring Festival, the whole village was very stable. In the past, every household in the village burned silver ingots and lit red candles during the Spring Festival, using more than one dou of rice. This year, most families have saved this money. Now the production plan for the whole village has been formulated. During the Spring Festival, thirty-five people in the village went to the fields to pull rice roots. Everyone also discussed opening a river. This river connects to Qiujiatan, is one zhang and two chi wide, and one zhang deep. Four hundred workdays have already been completed, and the remaining part will be completed soon.
    In the past, there was a lot of gambling in the village during the Spring Festival, but this year there was no gambling at all. Everyone's heart is focused on production.
               Representative of National Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Conference  Qiu Guanxing

### 今年春节和往年不一样——湖北劳模聂家香、浙江劳模邱关兴来信

　　今年春节和往年不一样
　　——湖北劳模聂家香、浙江劳模邱关兴来信　
            （一）编辑同志：
    我家住在湖北黄梅县戴家坝。我是一个农民。春节里，我想到我过去的痛苦生活，也想到了毛主席给我们带来的好日子。蒋介石土匪在我们村的时候，我没有能安下心来过一个春节，一年到头，少吃没穿，一到春节地主逼租逼债更加厉害。我挑上鱼、挑上菜，起早带晚，到处去卖，但是除了地主以外，又有谁买得起呢？前年大水冲破坝，我家四口人，每天吃点红薯渣过日子。当时我们村中有句话说：“地主老爷过节，种田的穷人受劫”，这句话真是千真万确。
    今年过春节，虽然天旱歉收，家中粮食不多，但是，我家总还收下六百多斤红薯，二百多斤黍子。吃的是不发愁了，也没有人来逼租逼债了。今年地里将有一个好收成。这日子就更好了。所以我心里很高兴。
    我们的生活渐渐的好起来，村子里的风气也正了，赌博瞎闹的事情没有了，学认字的，学唱歌的多起来了。

            （二）编辑同志：
    我们邱家桥村（在浙江省萧山县临浦区）的农民协会，在一月三十日开了一次代表会，这次会上决定了三件事情：（一）大家齐心防止匪特和不法地主造谣进行破坏活动；（二）过春节时要破除迷信，劝告农民们不要烧银锭、元宝，不要点红烛，节省下钱用在生产上；（三）趁冬闲大家赶快商订生产计划。
    春节期间，全村很安定。过去过春节全村每家烧银锭、点红烛要用一斗多米，今年大部分人家都把这笔钱省下了。现在全村的生产计划已经订出来。春节期间，全村有三十五个人下地拔稻根。大家并商量好，要开河。这条河是通邱家潭的，阔一丈二尺，深一丈，已经做了四百工，剩下这部分，很快就要完成了。
    往年过春节，村里很多赌博的，今年过春节赌博的全没有了，大家的心都放在搞生产上面。
               全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议列席代表  邱关兴
