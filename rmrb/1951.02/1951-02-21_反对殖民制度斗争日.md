　　February 21st is the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism." Democratic youth around the world commemorate this day in various ways because the democratic youth of various colonies engaged in some of the most heroic anti-imperialist struggles on this day.

　　On February 21, 1946, Indian naval personnel in the British Navy in Bombay held an armed uprising against British imperialism's colonial rule over India. The uprising spread from Bombay to all ports in India, completely paralyzing the British naval base. Subsequently, a series of similar uprisings occurred in the various British armed forces (including the air force, army, and police) in India. The broad masses of Indian workers and students also actively supported the uprising of the navy. For a full week from February 21st, general or partial strikes occurred everywhere in major Indian cities.

　　Since 1946, Indian youth have designated February 21st as their day to commemorate their opposition to British imperialist colonial rule. On this day, they express their determination to fight against imperialism.

　　February 21, 1947, is a great memorial day in the history of the Egyptian youth anti-imperialist movement. On February 9th of that year, students in Cairo held a large demonstration of 10,000 people, demanding that British troops get out of Egypt. At the same time, students and workers in Alexandria also held demonstrations. The demonstrating masses were brutally persecuted by the Egyptian government, which was controlled by British imperialism. To protest this atrocity, Egyptian workers and students held large-scale demonstrations and strikes on February 21. They organized "Action Committees" and suggested that February 21 be designated as the Egyptian people's "Day for Demanding the Withdrawal of British Troops."

　　In February 1948, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students convened the Southeast Asian Youth Conference in Calcutta, India, and put forward the slogan "Imperialism Get Out of Asia." On February 21, the third day of the conference, a large demonstration was held in Calcutta to celebrate the achievements of the conference.

　　In August 1948, the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth decided to designate February 21 of each year as "Day of Support for the Struggle of Colonial Youth."

　　The Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in 1949 also passed a resolution calling on the youth of all countries to commemorate this day every year, and to strengthen and support the struggle of the colonial people for national independence. After the meeting, February 21 was called "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism."

　　This year, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, in order to commemorate this day of struggle, call on all member organizations and all peace-loving youth and students to expand unity, strengthen the struggle of youth around the world against imperialist aggression and to defend world peace; and to actively support the struggles of youth in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia and other countries against imperialism.

　　On February 8th this year, the All-China Youth Federation, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a notice on commemorating the Day of Struggle Against Colonialism, calling on the youth and students of China to greet this great day of struggle with active actions, actively participate in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, and vigorously support the heroic anti-imperialist struggles of youth in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and other countries.

　　反对殖民制度斗争日
    二月二十一日是“反对殖民制度斗争日”。全世界的民主青年都以各种方式纪念这一天，因为各殖民地的民主青年曾在这一天进行过几次最英勇的反帝斗争。
    一九四六年二月二十一日，在孟买的英国海军中的印度籍海军人员举行武装起义，反对英帝国主义对印度的殖民统治。起义从孟买扩展到全印度各个港口，使英国的海军根据地完全瘫痪。接着，在印度的英国各种武装部队（包括空军、陆军和警察）中，都发生了一连串的同样性质的起义。广大的印度工人和学生也都积极支援起义的海军。自二月二十一日起的整整一个星期里，印度各大城市里到处发生总罢工或部分罢工。
    从一九四六年起，印度青年规定二月二十一日为他们反对英帝国主义殖民统治的纪念日，在这一天，表示他们对帝国主义斗争的决心。
    一九四七年的二月二十一日，是埃及青年反帝运动史上的一个伟大纪念日。是年二月九日，开罗学生举行了一次一万人的大示威，要求英国军队滚出埃及。同时，亚历山大的学生和工人也举行了示威。示威群众受到英帝国主义所操纵的埃及政府的残酷迫害。为了抗议这一暴行，埃及的工人和学生在二月二十一日举行了大规模的示威游行和罢工。他们组织了“行动委员会”，并建议定二月二十一日为埃及人民的“要求英军撤退日”。
    一九四八年二月，世界民主青年联盟与国际学生联合会在印度加尔各答召开的东南亚青年大会，提出“帝国主义滚出亚洲”的斗争口号。二月二十一日，大会的第三天，加尔各答举行大示威，庆祝大会的成就。
    一九四八年八月，世界民主青年联盟理事会决定以每年的二月二十一日为“支援殖民地青年斗争日”。
    一九四九年世界民主青年联盟第二次代表大会也通过决议，号召各国青年每年纪念这个日子，并加强和支援殖民地人民争取民族独立的斗争。会后，二月二十一日就称为“反对殖民制度斗争日”。
    今年，世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会，为了纪念这个战斗的日子，号召各会员组织和一切爱好和平的青年和学生扩大团结，加强全世界青年反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争；积极支援朝鲜、日本、越南、马来亚、菲律宾、缅甸、印度尼西亚及其他国家的青年反对帝国主义的斗争。
    今年二月八日，中华全国民主青年联合总会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国学生联合会联名发布了关于纪念反对殖民制度斗争日的通知，号召全中国的青年和学生用积极的行动来迎接这个伟大的斗争日，积极参加抗美援朝、反对美帝重新武装日本的运动，大力支援朝鲜、日本、越南及其他国家青年英勇的反帝斗争。
