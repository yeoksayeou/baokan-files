Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Through the active repair and new construction efforts of millions of workers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and farmers along the routes last year, the national highway mileage open to traffic has increased from more than 16,000 kilometers at the beginning of liberation in various regions to over 100,000 kilometers. The national highway mileage now exceeds that before the Liberation War by nearly 4,800 kilometers. At present, most of the highway bridges nationwide have been repaired into permanent bridges. The restoration of these highways plays a significant role in the exchange of materials throughout the country. In the past year alone, the number of vehicles traveling on these highways has greatly increased. The number of vehicles owned by state-owned transportation companies alone has increased by more than 40 percent compared to the previous year. Currently, over 800 transportation organizations nationwide own more than 170,000 public and private automobiles and animal-drawn vehicles. To ensure smooth traffic flow on the highways, highway maintenance systems have been established throughout the country, with maintenance carried out by road crews and residents along the routes.

　　全国公路通车里程达十万公里
    对全国物资交流起着极大作用
    【新华社二十九日讯】经过去年以百万计的工人、解放军战士以及沿线农民的积极整修和新建，全国公路的通车里程已由在各地解放之初的一万六千多公里增加到十万余公里。现在全国公路已超过解放战争前近四千八百公里。目前全国公路桥梁大部分已修成永久性桥梁。这些公路的修复，对全国的物资交流起着重大的作用。在去年一年中，这些公路上行驶的车辆大为增加。仅各国营运输公司的汽车，就较前年增加了百分之四十以上，现全国八百多个运输机构共拥有公私汽车和兽力车十七万多辆。为了使公路能顺畅地通车，全国各地都建立了公路养护制度，分别由道班和沿路居民养护。
