　　The Reborn Fengfeng Coal Mine
　　The Taihang Mountains, winding through southern Hebei Province, are called Gu Mountain. They are extremely rich in mineral deposits, and the coal produced is the best fuel for steam engines, coking, and other industries. The famous Fengfeng Coal Mine is located at the foot of Gu Mountain.
　　After the Anti-Japanese War, the Fengfeng Coal Mine was occupied by the Japanese invaders, who plundered the endless treasures of our motherland in huge quantities and relentlessly squeezed the lifeblood of the miners. At that time, the price of a miner's day's labor was only two and a half catties of mixed flour, and it was often deducted and delayed. During the great famine of 1943, wages dropped to half a catty of millet, and the workers actually received sorghum flour and sweet potato dried slices. Every day, more than ten worker corpses were carried out due to hunger, disease, and accidents. Miners with a little longer seniority can clearly recall these tragic scenes. In order to intensify the plunder of our resources, the Japanese invaders adopted illegal mining methods, resulting in extremely high casualty rates. The miners could not bear the multiple oppressions of the Japanese invaders, traitors, and foremen, and constantly went on strike, fled, secretly organized trade unions, and established close ties with the anti-Japanese guerrillas active in the Taihang Mountains. They were subjected to brutal massacres by the Japanese invaders. Many heroic patriots inside and outside the mine were stabbed to death by enemy bayonets in the middle of the night and thrown into abandoned coal mine shafts. People still remember that on the first day of repairing the No. 5 well in Nandayu, seventeen bloody male and female corpses were salvaged from below. However, the more ruthless the reactionary rulers were, the stronger the force of resistance hidden in the miners' hearts became. They persisted in their struggle until liberation.
　　On September 3, 1945, the Fengfeng Coal Mine was liberated, ending its era of terror and darkness. The People's Government first provided relief to the workers, abolished the foreman system, and restored production in nine days. In less than a year, the Kuomintang bandits attacked the liberated areas, and all the mine workers, who had just entered the light, heroically dismantled the machines and retreated to the Taihang Mountains to continue production.
　　Today, under the leadership of the People's Government, the working class has become the masters of the mine, and the Fengfeng Coal Mine has taken on a new look unprecedented in its forty-year history. The miners who struggled through those years of suffering know how to use all their strength to produce in order to defeat the enemy. They worked hard to produce, and production increased year by year. In 1950, they completed 102 percent of the plan, an increase of 35 percent compared to 1949. The average output per miner per day reached 0.81 tons in 1948. During the Japanese occupation, they grabbed civilian laborers, forced them with bayonets, and threatened them with hunger, and the number of workers reached about 10,000, but the output never exceeded 0.4 tons, which is incomparable to today. Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, the miners' wisdom has also been liberated, and new creations and inventions are constantly emerging. Han Zhicai, a worker at the No. 2 mine, changed the "residual pillar collapse method" to the "layered room and pillar coal mining method," increasing the recovery rate to 65 to 70 percent; Sun Xiangyin's team at the No. 1 mine improved the props, greatly strengthening the control of the roof; Yang Hu improved the technology of retracting wooden pile supports, saving a lot of materials. There are too many such achievements throughout the mine to list. Recently, the entire mine is confidently experimenting with the "descending collapse layered method" of coal mining recommended by Soviet experts. When the reporter went to visit, a worker excitedly said: "The coal cutting machine has already been delivered, comrade! Look! We will catch up with the Soviet workers." In the pits where the "longwall" mining method is used, electric drills are used to drill holes and blast, and coal is split with pneumatic picks or hand picks. The 60-meter electric chute can transport eight or nine tons of coal to the main roadway in ten minutes. Here, the air can flow along the working face, and the rows of wooden piles and duckbill canopies stand firmly, supporting the roof, which is a barrier to the miners' production safety. With the standardization and gradual improvement of the coal mining method, accidents have been significantly reduced. In 1950, deaths decreased by 40 percent and serious injuries decreased by 30 percent compared to 1949.
　　With the increase in production, the lives of the miners have also greatly improved. Now, the average worker can earn 500 to 600 catties of millet per month. Especially in terms of miner welfare, the government has made huge investments. In 1950 alone, the residential buildings built for the miners covered an area of nearly 20,000 square meters. Watching the brand-new houses being completed one after another, the miners couldn't help but recall the era of Japanese rule, when the rulers lived in the beautiful villas called "Gu Mountain Village," while the vast majority of miners could only dig small holes under the earthen cliffs to settle down. No one cared about illness or injury. Today, there are many hospitals and clinics in the mine, and the miners no longer feel it difficult to get medical treatment for illness or work-related injuries. Other facilities such as miners' canteens, bathhouses, and rest rooms have all been built. The canteen is well-run, and the food costs only 60 to 70 catties of rice per person per month.
　　Many outstanding workers have been promoted to leadership positions. Last year alone, 158 workers were promoted to mine directors, section chiefs, department heads, and foremen. The biggest characteristic of these worker cadres is that they go deep into production and work closely with the workers.
　　Thinking about the past life of blood and tears, and looking at the good times now, it's no wonder that the miners are so actively involved in the patriotic production competition and enthusiastically participate in military cadre schools. Since the launch of the patriotic production competition on November 18 last year, countless model producers and teams have emerged, and the entire mine is filled with challenges. The miners have put forward three competition slogans of safety, production, and learning. The repair shop has also promoted the Ma Hengchang team movement. By the end of December, the daily output had increased by 57.6 percent compared with the end of November, and the efficiency above and below the well reached 1.3308 tons. The Tongshun Well also saw seventeen, eighteen, and fifteen safe production teams. The miners also enthusiastically contributed labor and money to support the Korean people. The old worker Lao Liu contributed 23 workdays at once, and Zhou Zhanmei contributed his tools and donated 50 catties of millet every month. When the recruitment notice for the military cadre school appeared on the walls of Fengfeng, the trade union office was immediately crowded with young workers. Yang Huixiang, who was over the age limit, insisted on lowering his age and resolutely demanded to participate in the military cadre school in order to strengthen the country's national defense forces.
　　Fengfeng is only one of the coal mining industries under the leadership of the People's Government, but we can already see the new face of the new China's coal mining industry, which is thriving.

### 新生的峰峰煤矿

　　新生的峰峰煤矿
    蜿蜒在河北省南部的太行山脉称做鼓山，矿藏极其丰富，所产煤炭是蒸气机炼焦等工业的最好燃料。著名的峰峰煤矿就建立在鼓山麓下。
    峰峰煤矿在抗战以后被日寇侵占，无尽的祖国宝藏被巨量地掠夺，矿工们的血肉生命被无尽地压榨。那时候，每个矿工一天的劳动代价只有二斤半混合面，经常还被克扣和拖欠。一九四三年大饥荒时，工资降到了斤半小米，工人实际拿到的是高粱面和红薯干。每天因饥饿、疾病、事故而死亡被抬出去的工人尸体，总在十个以上。工龄稍大一点的矿工，都能清楚地忆起这些悲惨的景象。日寇为了加紧掠夺我资源，采用了非法的开采方法，因此伤亡事故极多，矿工们受不了日寇、汉奸、把头的重重迫害，不断地怠工、逃亡、秘密组织工会，并与活跃在太行山里的抗日游击队取得了密切的联系。他们曾遭到日寇疯狂屠杀，矿里矿外很多英勇的爱国者半夜里被敌人刺刀挑死后丢在煤矿废井里。人们还记得当南大峪五号井开始修理的第一天，便从下面打捞出十七具血肉淋淋的男女尸体。但，反动统治者愈凶狠，潜藏在矿工心底的反抗力量也就愈强，他们坚持着斗争直到解放。
    一九四五年九月三日，峰峰煤矿获得解放，从此结束了它的恐怖黑暗时代。人民政府首先救济工人，取消把头制，九天就恢复了生产。不到一年，国民党匪帮向解放区进攻，刚刚进入光明的全矿职工，英勇地拆卸了机器，撤退到太行山中继续坚持生产。
    今天，在人民政府领导下，工人阶级做了矿山的主人，峰峰煤矿呈现出了四十年有史以来从未有过的新面貌。从那些苦难岁月里挣扎过来的矿工们，是懂得如何把全副力量用来生产以击败敌人的。他们努力生产，生产量逐年提高，一九五○年完成计划的百分之一百零二，比一九四九年提高了百分之三十五。每个矿工一天的平均产量在一九四八年就已达到了零点八一吨，日寇统治时，抓用民伕，用刺刀强迫，用饥饿威胁，工人数达到了万人左右，但产量从来没有超过零点四吨的，与今天相较真是不可同日而语。在中国共产党的教导下，矿工的智慧也解放了，新的创造发明不断出现。二矿工人韩志才将“残柱陷落法”改为“分层房柱采煤法”，使回收率提高到百分之六十五到七十；一矿孙相印小组改良了抬棚，对于顶板的控制力就大大加强；杨虎改进了木垛支柱回撤的技术，节省了不少材料。全矿像这样的事迹是多得难以尽举的。最近全矿正在满怀信心地试验苏联专家建议的“下行陷落分层法”采煤。当记者前往参观时，有个工人兴奋地说：“截煤机已经运来了，同志！你看吧！我们会向苏联的工人看齐的。”在用“长壁式”采煤法采煤的坑里，已经使用电钻打眼放炮，并用风镐或手镐劈煤，六十多米的电溜子在十分钟即可把八吨或九吨的煤运到大巷。这儿，空气可以顺着掌子面流动，并排的木垛和鸭嘴棚屹立着，稳固地支持着顶板，这是矿工生产安全的屏障。采煤法的踏上正规和逐步改进，伤亡事故有了显著的减少，一九五○年比一九四九年，死亡减少百分之四十，重伤减少百分之三十。
    随着生产量的提高，矿工生活也大大改善了，现在一般工人每月可以赚到五、六百斤小米。特别在矿工福利事业方面，政府曾经花费了巨大的投资，单就一九五○年来看，为矿工修建的住宅占地近二万平方米，眼看着一幢幢崭新的房屋落成，矿工们不禁想起日寇统治时代，在题为“鼓山庄”的优美小洋房里住着的是统治者，广大矿工是只能自己在土崖下挖个小洞安身，生病、伤亡是没人理睬的，今天矿中设有许多医院医务所，矿工们不再为疾病、公伤而感到医治的困难了。其他如矿工的食堂、澡塘、休息室等全都建筑了起来，食堂办得很好，每人每月伙食费只需六、七十斤米就够了。
    不少优秀工人被提拔到了领导地位，去年一年就有一五八个工人升为矿长、股长、科长、领班。这些工人干部的最大特色是深入生产，紧密地与工人群众在一起工作。
    想想过去的血泪生活，看看现在的好光景，怪不得矿工们那样积极地投入爱国主义生产竞赛，踊跃地参加军事干部学校。去年十一月十八日，全矿展开了爱国主义生产竞赛以来，涌现了无数的模范生产者和小组，全矿一片挑战声，矿工们提出了保安、生产、学习的三个竞赛口号，修理厂还推行了马恒昌小组运动，到十二月底，日产量已较十一月底提高了百分之五十七点六，井上下效率达到一点三三零八吨，通顺井并出现了十七、十八、十五三个安全生产区队。矿工们并且热烈地献工献金支援朝鲜人民，老工人老刘一下子献出了二十三工，周占梅献出了自己的工具，每月还捐献五十斤小米。当军事干部学校招生布告出现在峰峰墙上时，工会办公室里立刻拥满了青年工人，超过招生年龄的杨会祥硬把年龄降低，坚决要求参加军事干部学校，以便加强祖国的国防力量。
    峰峰只是人民政府领导下的煤矿工业之一，但我们仅从这一角已经可以看到新中国煤矿工业正在蒸蒸日上的新面貌了。
