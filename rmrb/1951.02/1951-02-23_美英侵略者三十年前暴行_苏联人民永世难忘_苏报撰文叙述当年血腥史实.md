　　美英侵略者三十年前暴行
    苏联人民永世难忘
    苏报撰文叙述当年血腥史实
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二月二十一日是苏联红军自美英侵略者的蹂躏下解放苏联北部的三十一周年纪念日。苏联各大报纸均撰文叙述美国侵略者在一九一八到一九二○年间在亚尔干日尔斯克州的血腥罪行。劳动报发表了布拉金及舍维罗夫的文章称：苏联人民绝不会忘记美、英、法帝国主义者当时对苏维埃共和国的血腥干涉。美英干涉军曾像窃贼一样地侵占了亚尔干日尔斯克，并建立了极端血腥的恐怖统治。在攻占了亚尔干日尔斯克之后，美英强盗们曾野蛮地虐杀俄罗斯人民，使他们的鲜血染红了大地。有五万二千人被投入监狱和集中营。侵略者曾在许多村庄纵火焚烧，抢劫农民的房舍并赶走他们的牲畜。整个沦陷区被抢劫一空。侵略者的血腥罪行是苏联人民世世代代不能遗忘的。红海军报发表波利扬诺夫的文章称：三十年前美英侵略者在苏联领土上的暴行现在正由他们在朝鲜及其他国家内重演着。但是，全世界爱好自由的人民正由伟大的苏联领导着，坚决制止战争、维护世界和平。
