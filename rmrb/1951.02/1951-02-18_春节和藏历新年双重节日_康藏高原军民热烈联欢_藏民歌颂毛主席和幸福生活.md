Xinhua News Agency, Kangzang Front, 16th: Delayed news: This year's Spring Festival happens to coincide with the Tibetan New Year. The Tibetan people in the Kangzang Plateau where the People's Liberation Army is stationed are spending this double festival with their own army in incomparably happy spirits. During the Spring Festival, groups of Tibetan men and women, playing the stringed instrument, dancing the Lhasa tap dance, and singing Tibetan songs and operas to their hearts' content, praised Chairman Mao and their own happiness. They sang: "Chairman Mao is great and lofty, like the rising red sun, the People's Liberation Army is respectful and noble, like the divine eagle in the sky..." Some Tibetans, wearing new clothes of red, green, and other colors, carrying zanba (roasted barley flour) bags, braved the mountain winds and crossed the mountains, all the way from 200 li (approx. 62 miles) west of the Jinsha River, to come to the People's Liberation Army garrison to participate in the New Year celebrations. The local monasteries held a grand Cham dance ceremony on the Tibetan New Year's Eve. The Living Buddhas of the monasteries invited the troops to visit. On the morning of New Year's Day, the colorful silk fabrics draped over the roofs of Tibetan people's houses fluttered in the wind. The Tibetan people warmly sprinkled zanba flour on their own army, some commanders and fighters were almost completely covered in flour, this is a custom that Tibetans consider auspicious. On this day, the Tibetan people ate the best food and drank highland barley wine. They gave fried pastries in clarified butter and highland barley wine to the People's Liberation Army.
　　The troop's Yangko team, waist drum team, and flower stick team performed everywhere for the Tibetan people during the Spring Festival to celebrate the festival. The troops also presented many valuable gifts to the Tibetan landlords. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the troops also held joint army-people gatherings, inviting local Tibetans to eat tea and snacks and watch plays. After nightfall, the commanders and fighters of the various units were busy fetching water for the landlords (because Tibetan customs prohibit fetching water on New Year's Day). The army and the people were exceptionally happy and harmonious.

　　春节和藏历新年双重节日
　  康藏高原军民热烈联欢        
    藏民歌颂毛主席和幸福生活
    【新华社康藏前线十六日电】迟到消息：今年的春节恰好和藏历新年是一天。康藏高原上的解放军驻地的藏族人民都以快乐无比的心情，跟自己的军队度过这双重佳节。春节中，成群的藏族男女，拉着弦子，跳着拉萨踢踏舞，纵情地高唱藏曲和藏戏，歌颂毛主席和自己的幸福。他们唱着：“毛主席伟大崇高，如初升的红太阳，解放军尊敬高贵，如天空的神鹰……。”有些藏民穿着红红绿绿的新衣，背着糌巴口袋，从金沙江以西二百里外，冒着山风，越过重岭，特地赶到解放军驻地参加新年联欢。驻地的喇嘛寺院于藏历除夕举行了大跳神会。寺院的活佛邀请部队去参观。元旦日的清晨，披在藏民平房顶上的各色绸布，迎风飘舞，藏民们亲热地把糌巴面撒给自己的军队，有些指战员几乎被撒成粉人，这是藏民认为吉祥的风俗。这一天，藏民们吃着最好的饭，饮着青稞酒，他们把酥油炸的果子和青稞酒送给解放军。
    部队的秧歌队、腰鼓队和花棍队，在春节中到处给藏民表演贺节。各部还将许多贵重的礼物，赠送给藏族房东。在春节前夕，各部并举行了军民联欢会，请当地藏民吃茶点，看戏。入夜后，各部指战员都忙着给房东挑水（因藏俗元旦忌挑水）。军民异常欢乐融洽。
