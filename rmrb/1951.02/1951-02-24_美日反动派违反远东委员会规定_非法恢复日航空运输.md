Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd dispatch: Tokyo news: The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are stepping up activities to revive the Japanese Air Force. The reactionary Yoshida government, disregarding the Far Eastern Commission's regulations prohibiting Japan from rebuilding its air force and civil aviation, actually passed the so-called Domestic Air Transport Enterprise Law Amendment on the 20th, allowing the organization of Japanese air transport companies. According to a dispatch from the Kuomintang bandit Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 21st, a "reliable source" revealed that the Yoshida government has also illegally decided to allocate 1.6 billion yen to build six former military airfields located in Nagoya, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Sendai, Aomori, and Sapporo, making them "the latest type of airports" that "can be used by new-style giant transport planes." Furthermore, according to a dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency: A formal organ of the Yoshida government recently issued questionnaires to all former personnel of the Imperial Japanese Air Force regarding their training, military experience, and language skills. The Dentsu News Agency pointed out that in addition to establishing a core for the future Japanese Air Force, the Yoshida government plans to use this company to transport the so-called "National Police Reserve Force" domestically.

    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：美、日反动派正在加紧进行复活日本空军的活动。吉田反动政府不顾远东委员会关于禁止日本重建空军和民用航空的规定，竟于二十日通过所谓国内空运企业法修正案，准许组织日本的航空运输公司。据国民党匪帮中央社东京二十一日讯，据“可靠方面”透露，吉田政府并已非法决定拨款十六亿日元修建位于名古屋、广岛、福冈、仙台、青森、札幌各地的六个前军用飞机场，使它们成为“最新式的飞机场”，“能供新式巨型运输机降落”。又据电通社消息：吉田政府的正式机关最近并曾向前日本帝国空军的一切人员发出关于他们所受的训练、军事经验与语文知识的调查表。电通社指出：组织日本航空运输公司的措施，除了是为将来的日本空军建立核心外，吉田政府还计划利用该公司在国内运输所谓“国家警察后备队”。
