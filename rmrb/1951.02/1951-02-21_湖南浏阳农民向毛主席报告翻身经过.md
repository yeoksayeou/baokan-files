To our respected Chairman Mao:

Under the rule of the Kuomintang, we peasants lived lives worse than beasts of burden. Landlords, bureaucrats, and warlords colluded with each other, daily逼rent, forced debt repayment, and pressed us into military service, causing us to reach the point where "sickles hung on the wall, and there was no food to eat." Especially the ill-fated (Central) Army under the command of those warlords, they implemented a scorched-earth policy wherever they went, leaving us without fields, land, or homes. We had nowhere to voice our grievances, nowhere to seek redress, forcing us to live a life where we could neither live nor die. However, recalling the great revolution led by you in Hunan in 1930, we gained the courage to fight stubbornly against the reactionary forces. We believed that one day we would see the sun, see Chairman Mao, and achieve complete liberation.

Our ideal has finally been realized. Liuyang was liberated the year before last, and last spring we implemented rent reduction and deposit refunds. At the beginning of November, we began the land reform movement.

Before the land reform began in our township, the landlords spread rumors and sabotage, hiding their property in an attempt to undermine the land reform. The local tyrant landlord Tan Zilong destroyed a newly built house and hid all farming tools and surplus grain. Landlord Yan Xiaoping wrote other people's names on his farm tools and threatened us, saying, "If that representative says I am a landlord, I will tear him to shreds." But all the peasants in our village were united and saw through all the conspiracies and tricks of the landlords. Through repeated reasoning and struggle, we finally defeated the arrogance of the forty-three landlords in the whole township, successfully completed the land reform, and the peasants recovered more than 4,300 mu of their own land, and were allocated more than 1,400 houses, more than 3,800 shi of surplus grain, and farm tools and cattle.

Now every family and every person has made a production plan and started cultivating on their own land. In order to prevent drought, we repaired 51 large ponds and built a large river dam during the land reform, built a new waterwheel, and dug 32 irrigation canals. Now we are preparing to continue building a large pond dam and digging 10 new ponds. These projects started on January 19, with more than 3,000 people participating.

During the land reform, we received help from peasant brothers from other townships. The local tyrant landlords Tan Zilong, Tan Xinxia, etc., were all escorted back by peasants from other townships. These facts made us understand the truth that peasants all over the world are one family. So we took the initiative to organize support teams to help other townships carry out land reform. Eighty-six peasants have volunteered to participate.

To celebrate the victorious completion of the land reform, we held a celebration meeting on January 16. The faces of the men and women peasants in Dongping Township were filled with smiles of victory. The venue was filled with farm tools, livestock, and furniture seized from the landlords. Seeing so many fruits of victory, everyone's hearts blossomed. The farm laborers Li Wandong, Zheng Guixiang, and others, who had never dared to speak before, now happily ran to the stage and spoke out their hearts. At the end of the meeting, we burned all the land deeds of the landlords. We shouted with unprecedented joy, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the emancipation of the peasants!"

　　湖南浏阳农民向毛主席报告翻身经过
    敬爱的毛主席：
    在国民党统治下，我们农民过着牛马不如的生活，地主、官僚、军阀互相勾结，每天向我们逼租、逼债、拉壮丁，害得我们“禾镰子上壁，就没有饭吃”；尤其是那些军阀指挥下的遭殃（中央）军，他们每到一地就实行三光政策，搞得我们没田、没地、没屋住，有话无处说，有冤无处伸，逼得我们求生不得，求死不能。可是回想到一九三○年，你领导湖南农民轰轰烈烈的大革命时，我们就有了与反动势力顽强斗争的勇气，我们相信总有一天能见到太阳，见到毛主席，得到彻底的解放。
    我们的理想终于实现了。前年浏阳解放，去年春天我们实行了减租退押，十一月初又开始了土地改革运动。
    当土地改革在我乡开始以前，地主们就造谣破坏，隐藏财物，企图破坏土地改革。恶霸地主谭子龙，破坏了一栋新建筑的房屋，并将所有农具余粮也都隐藏起来。地主晏小平把自己的农具写上别人的名字，并威胁我们说：“那个代表说我是地主，我就要抓烂他一身肉。”可是我们全村农民团结得很紧，并识破了地主的一切阴谋花样，在反复的说理斗争中，终于将全乡四十三个地主的威风打垮了，胜利完成了土地改革，农民们收回了自己的土地四千三百多亩，并分到房子一千四百余间，多余粮食三千八百余石及农具耕牛等。
    现在我们每家每个人都订了生产计划，开始在自己的土地上耕种起来。为了预防旱灾，在土地改革中我们修好大塘五十一口，筑了大河坝一个，新建筒车一张，水圳三十二条。现在我们又准备继续建筑大塘坝一个，加开新塘十口。这些工程已在一月十九日开始，有三千多人参加。
    在土地改革中，我们曾得到外乡农民兄弟的帮助，恶霸地主谭子龙、谭新遐等都是由外乡农民押送回来的。这些事实使我们懂得了天下农民是一家的真理。于是我们又主动地组织了支援队，帮助外乡去搞土地改革，自愿参加的农民已有八十六人。
    为了庆祝土地改革的胜利完成，我们在一月十六日开了一个庆祝大会。东平乡男女农民的脸上都挂着胜利的笑容。会场上摆满了从地主手中夺回的农具、耕畜和家具，看到这许多胜利果实，大家心里都笑开了花，雇农李万东、郑桂香等人从来不敢说话的。现在也都兴高彩烈的跑到台上大声说出了自己心里的话。大会结束时，我们把地主们的田地契约一齐用火烧了。我们用从来不曾有过的快乐心情欢呼“毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！农民翻身万岁！”
