Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, February 21st: TASS, Delhi, February 21st—The third session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East's Industrial and Trade Committee has opened in Lahore (Pakistan). Representatives from eighteen countries, including the Soviet Union, several observers from specialized agencies, and a representative from the World Federation of Trade Unions are participating in the work of this session.

　　After the opening of the meeting, the Soviet representative made a statement drawing the meeting's attention to the fact that the largest country in the Industrial and Trade Committee, responsible for solving the most important problems of Asian and Far Eastern countries, China, with a population of 500 million, does not have a representative present, and this situation cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the Soviet representative proposed to expel the Kuomintang elements from the committee and invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the work of the committee. The majority of the US-British group in the committee decided not to discuss the Soviet proposal. The Soviet, Indian, Burmese, and Indonesian delegations voted in favor of discussing the Soviet proposal, while the Pakistani representative abstained. The Soviet representative pointed out that this decision of the committee was wrong and illegal.

　　The Soviet representative continued: The governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have the absolute right to participate in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East as representatives of the people of these countries. Based on this, the Soviet representative proposed to expel the representatives of the Syngman Rhee clique and the Bảo Đại puppet "government" from the committee. However, at the instigation of the US and British representatives, the majority of the committee decided not to discuss this proposal.

　　The committee meeting discussed the secretariat's report on the industrial development and plans of Asian and Far Eastern countries. The Burmese representative rightly criticized the report for not including information on China's economic development. The representative said that this situation would not have occurred if representatives of the People's Republic of China had been invited to participate in the work of the committee. The meeting will also discuss issues concerning the industrial and trade development of Asian and Far Eastern countries.

　　远东经委会工业与贸易委员会开会
　　苏联代表提议驱逐蒋匪代表
　  印度、缅甸、印尼代表支持苏联提议
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社德里二十一日讯：联合国亚洲暨远东经济委员会的工业与贸易委员会第三届会议，已在拉合尔（巴基斯坦）开幕。参加这届会议工作的有十八个国家的代表，包括苏联、专门机关的若干观察员与世界工联的代表。
    会议开幕后，苏联代表发表声明提起会议的注意说：在这个负有解决亚洲与远东各国最重要问题的责任的工业与贸易委员会中，拥有五亿人口的最大的国家——中国还没有代表出席，这种情形是不能容许的。因此，苏联代表提出建议把国民党分子从委员会中开除出去，邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加委员会的工作。委员会中的美、英集团的多数，决定不讨论苏联这个建议。苏联、印度、缅甸和印尼代表团投票赞成讨论苏联的建议，巴基斯坦代表弃权。苏联代表指出：委员会这种决定是错误而且非法的。
    苏联代表接着说：越南民主共和国政府及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，有绝对的权利作为这些国家的人民的代表，参加亚洲暨远东经济委员会。根据这一点，苏联代表提出建议，把李承晚集团的代表及保大傀儡“政府”的代表开除出委员会。然而在美、英代表的授意下，委员会的多数决定不讨论这个建议。
    委员会会议讨论了秘书处就亚洲与远东各国的工业发展与计划所作的报告。缅甸代表正当地批评了这个报告，因为它没有包含关于中国经济发展的情况。这位代表说，假若中华人民共和国代表被邀参加委员会的工作，这种情形本来是不会发生的。会议并将讨论关于亚洲与远东各国的工业和贸易发展的一些问题。
