　　After Land Certificates Were Issued in Huashi District, Yu County,
　  Farmers Showed Extremely High Enthusiasm for Production
    Editor:
    Before the land certificates were issued, the farmers in Huashi District, Yu County, Henan, had some concerns about the government's policy of developing production: they were afraid that the land they had been allocated was not secure and did not dare to manage it boldly. Some farmers were unwilling to apply more fertilizer to the newly distributed land, or they transported all the accumulated fertilizer to their original small plots. After the land certificates were issued, Hui Shui, a poor peasant in Zhangzhai Township, said regretfully: "I didn't listen to the government and didn't dare to apply manure to the newly distributed land, and I lost two loads of corn!" Now he is stepping up the construction of dams and weeding wheat in the newly distributed land. He is now convinced that the land will always be his.
    The experience of issuing land certificates in Huashi District shows that good publicity must be carried out before and after the issuance of certificates to eliminate some farmers' ideological concerns and stimulate their enthusiasm for production. At present, the farmers in Huashi District are in high spirits, and 8,000 men and women laborers in the district are weeding wheat. Such intensive weeding of wheat has never happened before.

### 禹县花石区发下土地证后  农民生产热情极高

　　禹县花石区发下土地证后
　  农民生产热情极高
    编辑同志：
    河南禹县花石区农民，在发土地证以前对于政府发展生产的方针，是存在着一些顾虑的：他们对于已分得的土地，怕不保险，不敢大胆经营。有些农民不愿在新分得的地里多上肥，或者把积下的肥全运到自己原有的小块地里。土地证发下以后，张寨乡贫农惠水很后悔地说：“没听政府的话，不敢在新分下的地里上粪，可把两担玉茭丢了！”现在他正加紧在新分的地里修堰、锄麦。他已确信土地永远是自己的了。
    花石区发土地证的经验说明，发证前后必须很好的进行宣传，以消除某些农民的思想顾虑，并启发他们的生产积极性。目前花石区农民的生产情绪很高，全区有八千男女劳动力正进行锄麦。过去这样紧张地锄麦的现象是不曾有过的。
