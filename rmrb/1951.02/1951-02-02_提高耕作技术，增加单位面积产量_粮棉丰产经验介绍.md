Improve Farming Techniques and Increase Yield Per Unit Area
Introduction to Grain and Cotton High-Yield Experiences

Editor's Note: The North China Agricultural Technology Conference is currently summarizing and exchanging practical experiences in increasing grain and cotton production. This is of great significance for this year's grain and cotton production increase. According to surveys, the average yield of cotton fields nationwide is about 75 jin of seed cotton per mu (about 90 jin in cotton-producing areas of North China). Last year, the total cotton planting area nationwide was over 50 million mu. If the average yield per mu can be increased by 10 jin of seed cotton, the national cotton harvest can be increased by over 5 million dan of seed cotton. However, based on the experience of Handan Farm in Hebei Province and high-yield cotton growers in various places last year, due to attention to improving farming techniques, the highest yield per mu has reached over 600 jin of seed cotton. In terms of grain, the average wheat yield per mu in North China is about 87 jin, and millet is about 200 jin, while the new records constantly created by production experts in various places have long exceeded this level. Therefore, as long as we learn from these experiences, the victorious completion of this year's major production campaign is entirely possible.

　　　　　　　　　　　　Planting Cotton Experience of Production Experts in Pingyuan Province

Xue Ziliang, a production expert in Cao County, Pingyuan Province, harvested 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. Cheng Yimin, a production expert in Shan County, also harvested 380 jin of seed cotton per mu. Zhang Jinfu, a production expert in Huojia, still harvested 187 jin of seed cotton per mu after replanting cotton due to hail damage. The following are their experiences in achieving high yields:

I. Attention should be paid to seed selection when planting Si Zi cotton. Cheng Yimin of Shan County planted three mu of degraded American cotton and five mu of Si Zi cotton. With the same soil quality and the same cultivation methods, Si Zi cotton yielded 380 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the degraded American cotton yielded 270 jin of seed cotton, 47% less than Si Zi cotton. Wang Yurui of Tangyi used Si Zi cotton seeds selected by himself in 1949 to plant two mu, yielding 350 jin of seed cotton per mu, and planted 17.4 mu of mixed and poor cotton seeds, yielding 120 jin of seed cotton per mu. This proves that planting Si Zi cotton, especially after seed selection, has a decisive role in increasing production.

II. Pay attention to selecting cotton fields and cultivating various different types of soil. Suitable land for planting cotton is loam soil that is flat, well-drained, well-ventilated, and sunny on mountain slopes. Inclined low-lying wetlands, heavy alkaline land, and heavy clay soil (colloidal clay) are not suitable land for planting cotton (but it is not absolutely impossible to plant; with good cultivation methods, the soil can also be transformed to obtain higher yields).

1. Planting cotton in loam soil (lianghe soil) and light sandy soil (sandy loam): Winter plowing should be early and deep, and harrowing should not be done after plowing. Spring plowing should be done with harrowing immediately after the thaw (light sandy soil may also not be spring plowed). The period around Grain Rain (Gu Yu) is suitable for sowing. Spot sowing or row sowing can be used, and the sowing depth should be about two fingers deep. The more mid-tillage, the better, generally six or seven times, up to ten times. Hilling soil after fertilization is better than not hilling.

2. Planting cotton in sandy soil (soil with heavier sand content): Moving clay into sandy soil or diverting water to accumulate mud slurry can increase viscosity. Harrowing for sowing without plowing after winter plowing. Some do not winter plow but spring plow. Sowing should be deeper than in loam soil.

3. Planting cotton in alkaline land: Alkaline land can also be suitable for planting cotton after improvement. Xue Ziliang of Cao County can harvest 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, Wang Yurui of Tangyi can harvest 350 jin per mu, and Li Jingming of Yanjin can harvest 300 jin per mu. Their methods are: Dig out alkaline soil and replace it with good soil. Do not plow in winter, sweep away alkali two or three times to prevent the alkali from rising. After shallow plowing and harrowing in spring, cover with grass to reduce the rise of alkalinity. Ditch for drainage during the rainy season, and hill soil during drought. Plow after rain in winter. Ensure seedling emergence, and pay special attention to protecting seedlings after cotton seedlings emerge. Methods for protecting seedlings: First, cover with fine sand after sowing; second, mix seeds with fine soil instead of plant ash; third, do not use plant ash for fertilizer (because plant ash is alkaline), use manure; fourth, use spot sowing, with a large sowing amount; fifth, thin seedlings in three times to avoid missing seedlings; sixth, hoe more after rain to prevent alkalinity from rising, and the rest is the same as for loam soil.

4. Planting cotton in clay soil (silt land) (including clay loam): Winter plowing should be deep, followed by coarse harrowing once (to prevent soil clods from being broken in the spring). Spring plowing should be done early (to prevent difficulty in plowing due to drought), followed by fine harrowing. Sowing should be shallow, and small beans can be added at the same time to help cotton seedlings emerge.

III. What kind of fertilizer is suitable for planting cotton and how to apply it appropriately: Huangfu Tianwei of Heze used two large carts of grass manure as base fertilizer and 70 jin of sesame oil cake as top dressing per mu last year, and harvested 300 jin of seed cotton. The year before, he used 35 jin less of top dressing and harvested 280 jin per mu. Last year, he harvested 20 jin more per mu due to more top dressing. Hou Cheng Lv Xiaoxian applied 30 jin of sesame cake as top dressing, and each mu harvested 30 jin more than the same soil quality and the same cultivation method, without top dressing. Types of fertilizer: base fertilizer should be mainly grass manure, soil manure, and livestock manure. Top dressing should use black beans, manure, bean cake, cottonseed cake, sesame cake, etc., with bean cake and cottonseed cake being the best. The amount of fertilizer depends on the fertility of the soil. Apply base fertilizer before spring plowing, and top dressing before flowering. Secondly, sandy land should use more stable manure as base fertilizer, and top dressing should be applied in stages to avoid loss.

IV. How to pinch hearts and prune branches: Pinching hearts and pruning branches are needed in fertile land, irrigated land (or in years with more rain), new flower land, and vigorous growth. The number of fruit branches left per plant depends on the growth situation, generally about eight to twelve, the middle and lower fruit branches should each leave six to eight cotton bolls (leave more in fertile land and less in barren land), and the upper part should leave one or two bolls. Pinch the heart around the Beginning of Autumn, and tip the shoot at the White Dew Festival. Do not pick the leaves too early.

V. Pest Control: The most serious pests of cotton are aphids and red spiders. Cotton plants that are not treated for aphid infestation grow slowly, have more frost flowers, and have a lower yield. Cotton plants that are not treated for red spider infestation stop growing and even wither and lose their leaves. According to the experience of production experts, pest control must be carried out at any time when pests occur. Tobacco water is simple and effective for controlling aphids, and flour paste water is also effective for controlling red spiders.

VI. Irrigation: According to the experience of Lu Yanshang of Xinxiang and Zhang Jinfu of Huojia, cotton that is irrigated yields about 50% more than cotton that is not irrigated. The irrigation period is once before sowing, or once after setting seedlings (in conjunction with fertilization) and once before flowering, or once after setting seedlings (if no irrigation was done before sowing, water should be irrigated after seedling emergence). Hoe slightly dry after irrigation (the number of irrigations should be increased or decreased according to the amount of rainfall). Irrigation method, open small ditches between flower rows for irrigation, and should not be irrigated too much.

VII. Wheat stubble cotton. Lu Yanshang of Xinxiang planted wheat stubble cotton, first watering it once before sowing, applying 90 jin of cottonseed cake per mu after plowing and harrowing, and watering it again when it blooms. Pay attention to pest control, pinching hearts, and pruning branches in cultivation, and hoe the ground more. He harvested 200 jin of seed cotton per mu. Wang Sanzhi of Anyang planted cotton between wheat rows, applying two large carts of stable manure per mu during spring plowing, and top dressing with 30 jin of oil cake. When aphids occurred, he treated them. He harvested 225 jin of seed cotton per mu. This shows that under conditions where irrigation is possible, fertilizer is sufficient, and pest control, cultivation, etc. are carefully carried out, planting wheat stubble cotton can also obtain a high yield.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　Hou Guanqun Reclaims Wasteland to Grow Wheat

Hou Guanqun is from Liyue Village, Nanle County, Puyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province. The local area was originally an old course of the Yellow River, with barren soil and weeds everywhere. It was under such conditions that Hou Guanqun began to grow wheat. Because he improved cultivation techniques, etc., he harvested 240 jin per mu in the second year, more than twice as much as the local farmers (generally around 100 jin). The following are Hou Guanqun's main experiences in wheat growing technology:

I. Transform wasteland into arable land. These wastelands have weeds that have rooted deeply underground, and it is not easy to remove them at once. Hou Guanqun came up with a method. In the first year, he planted a season of wheat in winter. After the wheat harvest in the second year, he did not plant any other crops. As long as weeds sprouted in the ground, he plowed it once. The summer sun is very hot, which can kill the ploughed out grass roots. Plowed five times in a row, deeper each time, weeds can be eradicated.

II. Deep plowing, fine harrowing, and diligent weeding. For general stubble land, after the autumn harvest, first plow it once with a plowshare, let the sun fully expose the topsoil, spread manure, and then plow it again with a plow, the depth should be two fingers deeper than the subsoil, harrow longitudinally and continuously five times, and then harrow twice after a while, for a total of seven harrowing (generally no more than five times). Around the Qingming Festival in the spring, when the seedlings are four or five inches long, hoe the weeds twice in a row.

III. Sow early and apply more fertilizer. Whether it is early wheat land, early stubble land, or late stubble land, his wheat is always planted four or five days earlier than others. He also applies more circle grass manure, generally four carts per mu (about 5,000 jin), but he applies four carts, plus forty jin of rapeseed cake.

IV. Prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Sowing wheat early has one disadvantage, that is, it is afraid of mole crickets eating it. In order to prevent mole crickets, use half an ounce of red arsenic mixed with millet per mu, and plant it in the ground with wheat seeds to kill insects. And before sowing wheat, soak the seeds in warm water to prevent diseases.

In addition, he also introduced the excellent wheat variety "Youzi Wheat" and conducted field seed selection every year.

Hou Guanqun also has two experiences in studying wheat growing technology:

I. Deep plowing and fine harrowing are not only aimed at removing weeds, loosening the soil, and retaining moisture. He said that the soil must also be exposed to the sun. Soil that has been sun-dried can increase fertility and is much better than simply applying manure.

II. Wheat should be planted early rather than late. Early planting not only saves seeds, but also has a great effect on increasing yield and accelerating maturity. The Nanle County area mostly plants wheat after the Autumn Equinox, but Hou Guanqun always rushes to plant it by the Autumn Equinox. He said: "In our place, it is still possible to plant wheat before the Cold Dew, but even if more fertilizer is applied after the Cold Dew, it will not grow well."

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yang Jianshan Growing Millet (粟)

Yang Jianshan, a high-yield expert, is from Nanwang County, Northeast of Juancheng, Pingyuan Province. In 1950, he planted one mu of spring millet and harvested 800 jin, more than 560 jin per mu than the best local millet; the millet planted after the wheat harvest yielded more than 600 jin per mu, more than 400 jin per mu than the local direct-seeded spring millet.

How did Yang Jianshan achieve such results? He said: "Farmers rely on the land, the land relies on manure, and deep plowing and careful cultivation can produce more grain." He also said: "To grow millet, choose loam soil, bean stubble is better than sweet potato stubble." Therefore, he not only studied the rotation method of millet, but also responded to the call of the higher authorities and adopted effective methods of deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilization. He applied 5,000 jin of base fertilizer (circle manure) per mu, and used a drill to plant 70 jin of bean cake per mu during the third mid-tillage. He believes that both winter plowing and spring plowing are very important, and he always uses half a more worker for each plowing, so his land is plowed deeply and finely. He also said: "Winter plowing emphasizes freezing, and summer plowing emphasizes sun exposure," so the land plowed in winter is usually not smoothed (also called covering the land), so that the soil can be fully decomposed.

He pays great attention to the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests. He uses more than a dozen grass bundles per mu, wraps some manure, and wets the millet stalks with water and puts them in the millet field, so that the stench spreads, attracting mole crickets, gathering and killing them. During winter plowing, he mobilized his whole family to pick up insect pupae, insect eggs, and grass roots to reduce insect pests. Before sowing, mix the seeds with cotton oil. Mole crickets will not eat the oil-mixed seeds. Because he used various methods to prevent the harm of underground insects, his millet did not have missing seedlings.

Regarding the sowing period of millet, his experience is: "Millet is sown at the right time." That is to say, the time when millet is sown and the time when it emerges must be calculated first. Because he found the law of millet germination and emergence, he always sows after noon on the Beginning of Summer. The reason is that if the soil is dry and hot when the millet seedlings emerge, the seedlings are prone to wither. If you plant in the afternoon and the seedlings emerge in the afternoon, the soil is cool and the air is humid, and the seedlings can grow well.

From seedling emergence to harvesting, he paid special attention to mid-tillage and field management. Before the millet emerges, when it is three-tenths of an inch thick from the ground, roll it over with a stone pier to reduce mole crickets. When the seedlings are 1.3 inches high, start the first thinning, which requires transverse hoeing, leaving a mound of seedlings every eight inches, staggered from the other rows (finished character shape). When the seedlings are 1.5 inches high, thin the seedlings by hand, selecting healthy and disease-free ones, leaving three or four plants per mound, and be careful to pull out "millet foxtail". The number of mid-tillage is two times for transverse hoeing and two times for straight hoeing, and a total of six times are required, including thinning and weeding. His experience is that more mid-tillage is good, but the timing and method of hoeing are very important. Therefore, transverse hoeing is required for the first thinning, and straight hoeing is required for the second thinning. The above do not require deep hoeing. After ten days, transverse hoeing is performed again, which should be deeper than the above two times. The last time should be straight hoeing, and it is best to hoe to a depth of three or four inches.

After maturity, he harvests and threshes in the field. He said: "Millet stalks are bundled into bundles, which is time-consuming and prone to mold, and livestock do not like to eat them. The millet leaves at the threshing floor are not as clean as those in the field." According to his experience, one mu of millet can yield 750 jin of millet grass.

In addition, he also has rich experience in millet transplanting. He said: "Millet transplanting has advantages, which saves labor and seeds, adjusts labor, and at the same time, wheat stubble millet can replace spring millet, improving quality and yield."

According to his experience, seedlings should be planted eight or nine days earlier than spring millet. The area of ​​the seedling land is generally one point of seedlings can plant one mu of millet, but the seedling land should be fertilized more, and the land preparation needs to be fine. Eight or nine days before the Beginning of Summer, spread the millet seeds in the seedling area, spread them evenly, harrow them once, and trample them once. Before the wheat matures, the seedlings do not need to be watered, and they should be covered with mats on rainy days. Millet watered with water is prone to grow water roots, and it will not be easy to survive when transplanted."

The land for planting millet should also be deeply plowed and carefully cultivated, and the field management is the same as that of spring millet land. On the day of transplanting, water a little in the afternoon of the previous day, and then transplant in the afternoon of the next day; do not water too much, just wet it.

The plant and row spacing for transplanting are each eight inches, the same as for planting spring millet, and the depth is 1.5 inches. However, the plant hole must be more concave than the ground, so as to preserve rainwater. The transplanted plants can survive on the third day. On the fifth day, apply 70 jin of bean cake per mu. As for the number of mid-tillage and methods, it is the same as hoeing spring millet land.

The transplanted millet can mature four or five days after the End of Heat, only four or five days later than spring millet. This year he planted "Spinach Root" millet, which yielded 600 jin per mu, and the wheat stubble millet exceeded the yield of spring millet.

　　提高耕作技术，增加单位面积产量
    粮棉丰产经验介绍
    编者按：华北农业技术会议，近日正在总结和交流粮棉增产的实际经验。这对今年的粮棉增产是有很重要意义的。据调查，全国棉田每亩平均产量为籽棉七十五斤左右（华北产棉区为九十斤左右）。去年全国植棉面积共五千余万亩，只要每亩平均能增产籽棉十斤，全国棉花即可增收籽棉五百余万担。但根据去年河北省邯郸农场和各地植棉丰产能手的经验，由于注意提高耕作技术，每亩最高产量已达籽棉六百余斤。粮食方面，华北地区小麦每亩平均产量为八十七斤左右，谷子为二百斤左右，而各地生产能手们所不断创造的新纪录，也早已远远超过了这个水平。因此，只要我们好好地来吸取这些经验，今年大生产运动任务的胜利完成是完全可能的。
            平原省生产能手们的植棉经验
    平原省曹县生产能手薛子亮的棉花每亩收到四○○斤籽棉，单县生产能手程一民每亩也收到了三八○斤籽棉，获嘉生产能手张进福遭受雹灾后补种的棉花仍收到一八七斤籽棉。下面是他们所以获得丰产的经验：
    一、种植斯字棉应注意选种。单县程一民种植退化美棉三亩，斯字棉五亩，同样土质同样栽培，斯字棉每亩收籽棉三八○斤，退化美棉收籽棉二七○斤，每亩退化美棉比斯字棉少收百分之四七。堂邑王玉瑞用一九四九年种植自己选的斯字棉种籽二亩，每亩收籽棉三五○斤，另种混杂不良的棉种一七．四亩，每亩收籽棉一二○斤。证明了种斯字棉特别是经过选种的具有决定性增产作用。
    二、注意选择棉地和各种不同土壤的耕作方法。适宜植棉的土地是地势平坦，排水良好，地位通风及山地向阳的两合土。如系倾斜低湿地、重碱地、重粘性地（胶泥地）都不是植棉的适宜土地（但也不是绝对不能种植，有了好的耕作方法也可以改造土壤，得到较高的产量）。
    １、壤土（两合土）、轻砂土（砂质壤土）植棉：冬耕宜早宜深，耕后不耙，春耕在开冻后随耕随耙（轻砂土亦有不春耕的）。谷雨前后适为播种期，播种方式点播条播都可以，播种深度以二指深为适当。中耕愈多愈好，一般六、七次，最多十次。施肥后壅土比不壅的好。
    ２、砂土（砂质较重的土壤）植棉：移运粘土翻入砂土或引水淤积泥浆，可以增加粘性；冬耕后不耙，春耕时不犁便耙地播种。也有不冬耕而春耕的，播种要比壤土深些。
    ３、碱地植棉：盐碱地经过改良以后，也是适宜植棉的土地。曹县薛子亮每亩能收四○○斤籽棉，堂邑王玉瑞每亩能收三五○斤，延津李景明每亩收三○○斤，他们的方法是：挖去碱土换入好土。冬季不耕，扫碱二、三次，盐碱就不再上升，等春天浅耕耙地播种后，用草覆盖，可以减少碱性上升。雨季要开沟排水，天旱时要壅土。冬季下雨后要耕。保证出苗和棉苗出土后须特别注意保苗。保苗方法：第一、播种后用细砂覆盖；第二、拌种用细土，不用草木灰；第三、肥料不用草木灰（因草木灰是碱性）用厩肥；第四、播的方式用点播，播种量要多；第五，间苗分三次做，以免缺苗；第六、雨后多锄，防止碱性上升，其余和壤土相同。
    ４、粘土（淤地）植棉（包括粘质壤土）：冬耕宜深，随即粗耙一次（以防春季土块打不碎）。春耕宜早耕（防干旱难耕），耕后细耙。播种要浅，播时可加小豆同时点播以助棉苗出土。
    三、植棉施什么肥料适宜和怎样施用适当：菏泽皇甫天位，去年每亩用草粪两大车做基肥，麻油饼七十斤做追肥，收籽棉三○○斤，前年少用追肥三五斤，每亩收二八○斤，去年因多上追肥，每亩增收二○斤。后程吕孝先上了三○斤的芝麻饼做追肥，每亩比同样土质同样耕种，不施追肥的都要多收三○斤。施肥的种类：基肥宜以草粪、土粪、牲口粪为主。追肥用黑豆、大粪、豆饼、棉籽饼、芝麻饼等，以豆饼、棉籽饼最好。施肥量看土质肥瘦而定。施基肥在春耕前，追肥宜在开花前。其次砂土地宜多用厩肥做基肥，追肥须分次施下，以免流失。
    四、怎样摘心整枝：在肥地、灌溉地（或雨水多的年成）、新花地、生长旺的需要摘心整枝，每株留果枝数，看生长情况决定，一般的大致八至十二个，中下部果枝，每个留六至八个棉铃（肥地多留，瘦地少留），上部留一、二个铃。摘心在立秋前后，打梢在白露节，摘叶不能太早。
    五、治虫：棉花为害最重的是蚜虫、红蜘蛛，受蚜害不治的棉株，生长迟、霜花多，而且收量少。受红蜘蛛为害不治的棉株，生长停止，甚至落叶枯萎。据生产能手们的经验，发生虫害须随时除治，治蚜用烟草水简单而且效力大，治红蜘蛛用面糊水喷治也很有效。
    六、灌溉：新乡吕砚尚及获嘉张进福的经验，灌水的棉花比不灌水的棉花多收五成左右。灌水的时期在播种前灌水一次，或在定苗后（配合施肥）开花前各灌水一次，或者在定苗后灌一次（播种前未灌者须在出苗后灌水）。灌水后稍干就锄（灌溉次数要看雨水多少而酌量增减）。灌水方法，在花行间开小沟引灌，不宜灌的太多。
    七、麦茬花。新乡吕砚尚种植麦茬花，在播种前先浇水一次，耕耙后每亩施用棉籽饼九○斤，到开花时再浇水一回。在耕作上注意治虫、摘心、打枝，并多锄地，每亩收籽棉二○○斤。安阳王三只棉花种在麦行间，春耕时每亩施用厩肥二大车，追肥用油饼三○斤，蚜虫发生就治，每亩收籽棉二二五斤。这说明在能灌溉，肥料又充足，且能随时除虫、耕作等周到的条件下，种麦茬花也能得到丰产的。
            侯冠群开荒种小麦
    侯冠群是平原省濮阳专区南乐县李岳村人，当地原是黄河旧道，土质瘠薄，遍地野草。就在这样的条件下，侯冠群开始种麦，因为改进了耕作技术等，第二年每亩收了二四○斤，比当地农民多收一倍还多（一般在一○○斤左右）。以下就是侯冠群在种麦技术上所获得的主要经验：
    一、变荒地为耕地。这些荒地杂草已在地下扎了很深的根，盘综交错一时不易清除，侯冠群想出办法，在第一年冬种上一季麦子，第二年麦收后不再种旁的作物，地里只要草一露芽，就犁一遍，夏季日光热度很高，可以把犁出地面的草根晒死。这样连犁五遍，一次比一次深，杂草便可以根除。
    二、深耕细耙勤锄草。一般的槎子地，在秋收以后，则先用犁铧子犁一遍，让太阳充分晒透表土，撒过粪后再用犁犁一遍，深度要比底土犁深二指，纵横连续耙上五遍，隔一隔，再耙两遍，前后共耙七遍（一般不过五遍），开春清明前后，苗长四、五寸时，再连锄两遍草。
    三、提前播种，多施肥料。不论是早麦地、早槎地，还是晚槎地，他的麦子总是比别人早四、五天就种上。圈草粪施的也多，一般每亩施三车（约五○○○斤），他却施四车，并加上四十斤菜子饼。
    四、防治病虫害。麦子播种早了，有一样坏处，怕蝼蛄吃。为了防治蝼蛄，每亩地用半两红信石拌谷子，和麦种一起种在地里，就能杀虫。并且在小麦播种前，进行温汤浸种，就能防除病害。
    此外，他还引种了优良麦种蚰子麦，并每年进行田间选种。
    侯冠群在钻研种麦技术上还有两点心得：
    一、深耕细耙，目的不仅是清除杂草，使土壤疏松和保持水份，他说，土壤还须经过太阳曝晒。太阳晒过的土，肥力可以增加，比单上粪要好的多。
    二、种麦宜早不宜迟。早种不仅节省种子，且对增加产量，提早成熟都有很大效用。南乐县一带多在秋分以后种麦，但侯冠群总是赶着秋分就种上。他说：“在俺们那里，寒露以前种麦还可以，过了寒露即使再多施肥，也是长不好。”
            杨见善种谷子（粟）
    丰产能手杨见善，是平原省鄄城东北南旺县人。一九五○年他种了一亩春谷，打了八百斤，每亩超过当地最好的谷子五百六十多斤；收麦后种的谷子每亩收六百多斤，比当地直播的春谷每亩多收四百斤。
    杨见善怎样获得这样的成绩呢，他说：“庄稼人靠地，地靠粪，深耕细作才能多打粮食。”又说：“种谷要选两合土，红芋茬不如豆茬好。”所以，他不但研究了谷子的轮作法，并且响应了上级的号召，采取深耕细作多施肥的有效办法。他每亩地施基肥（圈粪）五千斤，中耕三遍时，每亩用耧耩豆饼七十斤。他认为冬耕和春耕都很重要，每次耕地都是多用半个工，因此他的地耕的又深又细。他又说：“冬耕重冻，夏耕重晒”，所以冬耕的地通常是不用擦平（有叫盖地的），以便于土壤充分分解。
    他对作物病虫害的防除非常注意，每亩地用十几个草把子，包些大粪，并用水把谷秸湿透放在谷地里，使臭味四溢，招致蝼蛄，聚而捕杀。冬耕时，他动员了全家拾虫蛹虫卵和草根，减少了虫害。下种前把种籽用棉油拌一下，油拌过的种籽蝼蛄就不吃。因为他用了各种办法，防止了地下虫的为害，所以他的谷子没有缺苗的。
    对谷子的播种时期，他的体会是：“谷子是出对时”的。就是说，谷子在什么时辰种，什么时辰出，要先计算出来。因为他找到谷子发芽出土的规律，所以他都是在立夏节过午播种。原因是，谷子出苗时，如果是天干地热，幼苗就容易枯萎。如果下午种，下午出苗，则土壤冷凉，空气湿润，苗子就能生长的好。
    由出苗到收割，他特别注意了中耕和田间管理工作。谷子未出苗以前，离地皮三分厚的时候，用石礅镇压一遍，也可减少蝼蛄。苗高一．三寸时，开始第一次间苗，需横着垅锄，每隔八寸留苗一墩与另行错开（成品字形）。苗高一．五寸时，再用手匀苗，匀苗时要选健旺的没病的，每墩留三、四棵，并注意拔去“谷莠子”。中耕次数是横锄、顺锄各两遍，连匀苗除草共需六遍。他的经验是中耕次数多是好的，但锄的时期和方法很是重要。所以第一次间苗时需横锄，第二次匀苗时用顺锄，以上都不需要深锄，隔十几天再横锄一遍，比以上两次要深些，最后一遍要顺锄，能锄到三、四寸深最好。
    成熟以后，他是在地里收打，他说：“谷秸捆成捆，又费工，易发霉，牲口不爱吃。在场里去穗有谷叶子，不及地里去的干净。”根据他的经验，一亩谷子能收七百五十斤谷草。
    此外，他对谷子的移栽，也有丰富的经验。他说：“谷子移栽有好处，既省工省种，又可调剂劳力，同时麦茬谷可顶春谷，提高了品质和产量。”
    根据他的经验，育苗时应比春谷早种八、九天，育苗地的面积，一般是一分苗子可栽一亩谷，但育苗地应多施些肥料，整地需要细碎，立夏前八、九天将谷种撒在育苗区，撒的要匀，撒过种子钯一遍，踩一遍就可以。麦子未成熟以前，苗子地不须浇水，阴雨天应用席盖上。水浇的谷子，容易生水根，栽的时候不好活。”
    栽谷的地同样要深耕细作，田间管理和春谷地一样。移栽时在头一天下午浇一点水，第二天下午再移栽；浇水不要太多，湿透了就行。
    移栽的株行距各八寸和种春谷一样，深一．五寸。但栽后株穴须比地面凹些，以便保存雨水。移栽后，第三天就可以成活了。第五天每亩施豆饼七十斤。至于中耕次数和方法，是和锄春谷地一样。
    移栽的谷子处暑后四、五天就可以成熟了，比春谷只晚四、五天。他今年栽的是“菠菜根”谷，每亩打了六百斤，麦茬谷超过了春谷的产量。
