Li Bing and His Son and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System
Jun Yu

I. From Yu the Great to Li Bing

The Chinese nation is one of the earliest to enter agricultural society in the world. At the latest, 2,500 years ago, a complete agricultural society was established on this vast land. For thousands of years, our ancestors have relied on agricultural production as their main production, labor, and reproduction, developing into a great nation. Due to the needs of agricultural production, the Chinese nation began to struggle against nature very early on; under the general goal of disaster prevention and increased production, the great achievements of the ancient Chinese people in overcoming floods have been recorded in history for thousands of years, setting a glorious example for mankind around the world. All nations in the world have legends of floods, but the most flood control records are found in an ancient Chinese book, the "Yu Gong" chapter of the Book of Documents. Yu the Great dredged rivers and diverted rivers, and his great achievements in flood control were widely spread among the people. Legend has it that Yu "humbled his palaces and devoted his efforts to ditches and canals." His work was not only to prevent floods, but also seemed to take into account water diversion for irrigation. Although it is still questionable what kind of water conservancy project Yu of the Stone Age could have completed, it is of profound significance that Yu the Great was regarded by his ancestors as an ideal "human king and emperor" because of his flood control efforts. From historical records, we can infer that the Sichuan Basin was once a low-lying area prone to flooding. The ancient people of Sichuan there began to fight against water very early on, accumulating a lot of valuable experience and water control technology, and producing many water conservancy engineers. According to legend, Yu the Great lived in the mountains of Min, which is now the area of Wenchuan or Beichuan in Sichuan. Even now, there are still many workers in the Chengdu area who "specialize in repairing river embankments and constructing wells." After Yu the Great, there were Du Yu, Kaiming, Li Bing (although Li Bing's origin is untraceable, there is ample reason to believe that he was from Sichuan), and Wen Weng and famous water control experts of past dynasties after Li Bing. As for Li Bing, if one does not believe in myths and legends, one must admit that he inherited and summarized the experience and methods of his predecessors over thousands of years, and succeeded in opening up the Dujiangyan project.

During the Spring and Autumn period, the State of Qin began to rise in the west of China. Before Qin Shi Huang unified China (221 BC), he had done a lot of work and played a certain role in the history of China's economic development. Many great water conservancy projects in Chinese history were completed during this period. In terms of irrigation, the Zheng Guo Canal in Shaanxi, the Dujiangyan in Sichuan, and the Qin Canal in Ningxia were completed, among which the Dujiangyan was the largest in scale and the most effective. These projects greatly helped Qin's unification cause, and the Dujiangyan still serves the people today, irrigating tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land. Its benefit is so extensive, its life span so long, and its annual cost so low that it has almost become a miracle in the world. The western Sichuan Plain is therefore known as the "Land of Abundance." The Dujiangyan is said to have been created under the leadership of Li Bing and his son (Li Bing was the governor of Shu, and his son Erlang participated in the water control project). According to historical records, in 316 BC, King Hui of Qin sent Zhang Yi to destroy Shu. Probably during the reign of King Xiaowen of Qin or King Zhaoxiang of Qin, Zhang Yi recommended Li Bing as the governor of Shu. The time was probably around 300 BC. Li Bing's purpose in opening up this project at that time was to "dig the Lidui to avoid the harm of the Mo River, build a large embankment to control the throat, called the Dujiangyan." In ancient times, the Min River (ancient Chinese books mostly regarded the Min River as the main stream of the Yangtze River, so the Yu Gong says "Mount Min guides the river, and separates eastward into the Tuo River") was affected by the Mo River (now the Dadu River, also known as the Dajinchuan) in the lower reaches, and the floodwaters of the Min River were not easily discharged, and the east bank was often flooded. Therefore, Li Bing dug the "Lidui," dividing the Min River into the "Outer River" (the main stream of the Min River) and the "Inner River" (diverted from the Dujiangyan and transferred to the Tuo River), diverting water to irrigate fields and diverting floods to reduce disasters, containing the dual purpose of flood control and irrigation. From the above simple historical explanation, we get two basic concepts: (1) From Yu the Great to Li Bing for nearly two thousand years, the Chinese working people have been fighting against water to protect and develop agricultural production, and in continuous experience and creation, they have completed very great water conservancy projects; (2) Ancient Chinese water conservancy projects all revolve around the general goal of agricultural production, emphasizing both flood control and irrigation, and developing them in combination.

II. The Emergence and Current Situation of Dujiangyan

Undoubtedly, Li Bing and his son were two outstanding water conservancy engineers in Sichuan at that time, and in the construction of the Dujiangyan project, in addition to Li Bing and his son, of course, many engineers and working people participated in its completion. Secondly, we should also point out that the Dujiangyan was by no means completed all at once at that time; over the past two thousand years, it must have undergone continuous improvement and development to become the scale it is today.

The "Sichuan Basin" was formed by the uplift and drying up of the "land and sea," probably after the fifth period of the Cenozoic Era. From the perspective of natural conditions, the Sichuan Basin is surrounded by high mountains ranging from 2,000 meters to 7,000 meters, with a low-lying area in the middle, covering a total area of about 230,000 square kilometers. In this basin, every year due to the convergence of runoff from rain and snow in the high mountains, "periodic" floods were caused at that time; after the water receded, local droughts could also be caused. Under the influence of this natural disaster, how to adapt to the environment and overcome water disasters became the basic requirement of the ancient people of Sichuan. After Qin annexed Shu, the center of Sichuan at that time was in Chengdu (Qin annexed Shu and then annexed Ba; Shu was in western Sichuan and Ba was in eastern Sichuan). The flooding of the Min River was the first to bear the brunt, so objective conditions required starting with the Min River first. This is the main reason why Li Bing wanted to "dig the Lidui and pass through the two rivers in Chengdu" in Guanxian County, western Sichuan, and complete the Dujiangyan (then called the Dujiangyan). Li Bing was an outstanding engineer. He assessed the terrain and observed the water conditions. He first selected the Guankou County as the dam site, which is where the Min River turns from a mountain stream rapid into a plain river channel, which is relatively easy to construct. The project that Li Bing did at that time was extremely great and simple. He used the years of experience of his predecessors and adopted the method of "bamboo cage filled with pebbles" to weave a diversion embankment to welcome and swallow the water flow, called the "Fish Mouth." The shape of the "Fish Mouth" is like a fish, dividing the Min River into two streams, one is the "Outer River" and the other is the "Inner River." In order to unblock the water of the "Inner River" to irrigate the fields in the hinterland, he also dug a mountain pass, called the "Lidui." Between the "Fish Mouth" and the "Lidui," and in the vicinity, there are also "diversion" and "streamlining" equipment to promote the smooth flow of the river into the "Inner River" (that is, the flow diverted from the Dujiangyan into the Tuo River), and maintain a certain water distribution between the Inner and Outer Rivers. He also widely opened river channels on both sides of the Min River, equipped with appropriate buildings. In this way, a complete irrigation system was formed. The Dujiangyan system now includes more than 260 canals and embankments, mainly irrigating paddy fields in 14 counties in western Sichuan, including Chengdu, Guanxian, Wenjiang, Shuangliu, Chongqing, Xinjin, Pengxian, Chongning, Pixian, Huayang, Xinfan, Xindu, Jintang, and Guanghan, covering about 5 million mu.

The Dujiangyan irrigation system is also one of the best irrigation systems in the world. The layout of the project is based on the natural situation, with staggered branches and crisscrossing ditches. Generally, irrigation and drainage are considered at the same time, and many tributaries have convenient transportation. The building materials are mostly "locally sourced"; the annual maintenance project saves labor and is simple, so Chinese and foreign experts and scholars who have been to Guanxian and seen the Dujiangyan are all sincerely convinced. In this large plain, due to the success of the Dujiangyan, "water and drought follow people's will, without knowing hunger, and there is no famine year, so the world calls it the Land of Abundance." This great project has existed and served the people for more than 2,000 years, except for occasional local damage and water shortage, and the annual maintenance cost is less than one-thousandth of the annual revenue. Such a "low-investment, high-return," "long-lasting" undertaking that benefits the country and the people is hard to find a few in the world!

III. Characteristics of Dujiangyan

Since the Dujiangyan is an outstanding and great project, it naturally has its characteristics. Its characteristics include scientific principles and ingenious engineering techniques.

First, the Dujiangyan is successful in planning. If we call the overall scale layout in the engineering plan and the coordination of surrounding environmental factors planning, and call the structure of buildings and the handling of local problems in the engineering plan design, then the engineering planning of the Dujiangyan is correct and satisfactory. From a modern perspective, although there are many places in the Dujiangyan that need to be improved, such as the treatment of sand and gravel, the control of water flow, and the need for permanentization of many buildings, modern scientific methods can be used to gradually solve them. However, the reason why the Dujiangyan can maintain for more than 2,100 years without declining is that Li Bing and his son and many water conservancy engineers at that time were able to understand the terrain, be familiar with the water conditions, and achieve success in planning and layout. They chose an appropriate water diversion location, arranged dozens of channels very well, and grasped the Min River water flow, and grasped the needs and development of the Chengdu Plain. We recall that at that time, there were no precision measuring instruments and no effective construction machinery, and we cannot but admire their genius success in planning the Dujiangyan project. Therefore, Li Yizhi also advocated after inspecting the Dujiangyan that "the scale should remain the same, only the construction method should be innovated." In the past, we often blindly worshiped foreign experts, thinking that they were better than us in everything, but the Dujiangyan negated this idea. Here we may cite a contrary example, that is, the Suiyuan Minsheng Canal built by the China Foreign Relief Society. In terms of channel construction design, the Minsheng Canal is better than the Dujiangyan. The buildings of foreign cement and aggregate are still well preserved. However, they did not consider enough, the planning was improper, and they made an irreparable mistake. This canal has never been able to exert the expected benefits. The reason why the Dujiangyan has great benefits, low annual maintenance costs, and long project life is mainly based on the foundation of good planning.

Second, the Dujiangyan is creative in construction. The building materials used in the Dujiangyan are mainly wood, bamboo, pebbles, and soil, which is a true "civil engineering" project. The "bamboo cage filled with stones" (anciently called bamboo net, net is the same as network) buildings used to divert water and resist flow are not easy to crack, and are very heavy, interconnected, can withstand tension and pressure, and placed in the water, durable and will not collapse. At the dam site, because the pebble riverbed is not solid, if the "fish mouth" or embankment is piled up with blocks of stone, then one place will shake, and cracks will follow, and the water will soak and the waves will brush, which will inevitably lead to the collapse of the overall situation. This kind of "bamboo cage filled with stone" work, it is said that during the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han Dynasty (the fifth year of Jianshi, the Yellow River broke through Dongjun, flooded the four counties of Yu and Yan, and it was impossible to block and restore it for a while), Wang Yanshi used it in the Yellow River, but the Yellow River is not like the Min River, lacking both bamboo and stone, so Wang Yanshi did not have the fame of Li Bing for thousands of years. Another example is the "Macha" used to block the river flow, which is made of three supporting trees, tied into a tripod frame with bamboo strips, arranged together, and then added with "bamboo skewers," "bamboo fences," "Cymbopogon schoenanthus," "bamboo mats," and covered with clay, becoming an impermeable temporary dam. With the "Macha" this "cut-off" equipment, the annual maintenance project can be carried out smoothly, and the placement and removal are also very easy. This kind of "local" "local method" project has great adaptability, and is the result of the hard work of the working people for many years, and it is worthy of our research and learning.

Third, the Dujiangyan's low cost, high efficiency, and immortality are the result of the accumulation of valuable experience over thousands of years. The Dujiangyan has the so-called six-character secret for water control: "Dig the beach deep, make the embankment low," which is said to have been left by Li Bing. Because the "Inner River" from the "Fish Mouth" to the "Lidui" is sometimes silted up, and the spring water sometimes blocks the flow, it needs to be "dug deep" until the "lying iron" set by the ancients on the riverbed is reached, to smooth its momentum. In the season when the water volume in the upper reaches of the Min River is large, the Inner River may have too much water. For safety, special "sand flying weir" and "herringbone dike" and other "breaking" equipment (breaking is equivalent to the spillway weir in modern engineering) are built to discharge the excess water into the "Outer River." These embankments are all placed on the sandy and gravelly riverbed and are made of "bamboo cages filled with pebbles" or simply piled up with pebbles. The foundation is not solid, so it cannot be made too high. Another example is the eight-character motto: "Cut corners when encountering bends," "Draw the heart when encountering straight lines," which can be seen at a glance as a summary of years of water control experience. "Cut corners when encountering bends" means that at the bends of rivers and canals, the concave peaks must be washed away, and the convex peaks must be silted up; "cutting corners" means removing the siltation at the convex peaks, so that the degree of curvature is reduced, so that the collapse of the peaks can also be stopped. This method is very consistent with modern river management principles and contains the meaning of "straightening the bend." "Draw the heart when encountering straight lines" means dredging the silted part of the river, which is equivalent to "digging a deep channel," to increase the water conveyance capacity of the river and canal. Whether it is the "six-character secret" or the "eight-character motto," it is by no means an ideal thing out of thin air, nor was it created by Li Bing alone, but the crystallization of the practical experience and creative ability of the working people and water conservancy engineers over thousands of years.

What does the Dujiangyan, this great project that continues to flow in the western Sichuan Plain, give us? Five million mu of irrigation, 2,150 years of long-term service, isn't this benefit big enough? Yes, it's big enough! However, we should not only see these benefits that can be counted in numbers; we should cherish the valuable legacy that the Dujiangyan has given us even more, that is, the history of the struggle between the ancient Chinese working people and water conservancy engineers and water, and their great and outstanding creative ability.

　　李冰父子和都江堰
　　君愚
　  一、从大禹到李冰
    中华民族是世界上最早进入农业社会的民族之一，最迟在二千五百年以前，一个完整的农业社会便在这块广大的土地上成立了。几千年来我们的祖先一直以农业生产为主要生产，劳动，繁殖，而发展为一个伟大民族。由于农业生产的需要，中华民族很早便开始了对大自然的斗争；在防灾增产的总目标下，中国古代人民在战胜洪水上的伟大成绩，数千年来彪炳史册，给世界人类树立了光荣的楷模。世界上各民族均有洪水的传说，其中治水记载最多的，要推中国的一部古书，尚书的禹贡篇。大禹疏江导河，种种治洪水的伟绩，深入广泛地传播在民间。传说禹“卑宫室而尽力乎沟洫”，他所做的工作，不仅是防治洪水，似乎还兼顾到挑水灌溉。虽然，石器时代的禹究竟能完成怎样的一种水利工程，至今还是疑问，但大禹因治水而被先民视为一位理想的“人王帝主”，其意义是很深长的。从历史记载中，我们可以推断四川盆地从前是个洪水漫溢的低地，那里的古四川人，早就开始与水斗争，积累了很多宝贵经验和治水技术，产生了不少的水利工程师。相传大禹住在岷山丛中，即现在四川汶川或北川一带地方，直到现在，成都一带“专修河堰，包打水井”的工人，仍然很多。大禹之后，有杜宇、开明、李冰（李冰的籍贯虽不可考，但有充足的理由，使我们相信他是四川人。）和李冰以后的文翁和历代治水名家。以李冰而言，如不相信神话传说的那样，谁也得承认他是继承并总结了前人几千年的经验、方法，而在开凿都江堰这个工程上成功的。
    春秋时，秦国便开始在中国的西方崛起。在秦始皇统一中国（公元前二二一年）以前，就做了不少的事业，在中国经济发展史上，曾起了一定的作用。中国历史上许多伟大的水利工程，都是在这个时期完成的。在灌溉方面，曾完成了陕西的郑国渠，四川的都江堰，宁夏的秦渠，其中以都江堰规模最大，为效最宏。这几个工程都给秦国的统一事业帮了大忙，而都江堰至今还为人民服务，灌溉着数万顷良田。其为利之溥，寿命之长，岁费之省，几乎成为世界上一个奇迹，川西平原也因此而号称“天府之国”。都江堰据说是李冰父子（李冰为蜀太守，他的儿子二郎参与治水工程）领导作成。根据历史记载，公元前三一六年秦惠王遣张仪灭蜀，大概在秦孝文王或秦昭襄王时，张仪荐李冰为蜀中太守。时间大概在公元前三百年前后。李冰当时开凿这个工程的目的是“凿离堆以避沫水之害，作大堰以扼蓄咽喉，称都安堰”。大抵古时岷江（中国古书多以为岷江为长江正流，故禹贡有“岷山导江，东别为沱”之语）因下游沫水（即今之大渡河，又称大金川）之害，岷江洪流不易宣泄，东岸每泛滥成灾，故李冰凿“离堆”，分岷江为“外江”（岷江正流）及“内江”（由都江堰分流，转入沱江），引水以溉田，分洪以减灾，包含有防洪和灌溉的双重目的。从以上简单的历史说明，我们得到两个基本概念：（一）从大禹到李冰近乎两千年间，中国劳动人民为了保障及发展农业生产，一直与水斗争，在不断的经验与创造中，已完成了很伟大的水利工程；（二）中国古代的水利工程，都是围绕着农业生产的总目标，防洪与灌溉并重，两者结合发展。
  二、都江堰的产生及其现状
    无疑问的，李冰父子是当时四川两位杰出的水利工程师，而在建筑都江堰这项工作中，除了李冰父子，当然还有很多的工程师和劳动人民参与其成的。其次，我们也应该指出，都江堰绝不是当时一下子就全部完成的；二千多年来，一定经过不断的改进，发展，才成为今日的规模。
    “四川盆地”的产生，系由于“陆海”隆起，干涸而成，时间大概在新生代第五期以后。由自然形势来看，四川盆地是处在四面由二千公尺到七千公尺的高山环峙之中，中间低洼地带，总面积约在二十三万平方公里左右。在这个盆地里，每年由于高山雨雪径流的汇集，当时便造成“定期”性的水灾；水退之后，又可能造成局部的旱灾。在这种天灾影响之下，如何适应环境，克服水患，便成为古四川人的基本要求。秦并蜀后，当时四川的重心在成都（秦并蜀后而再并巴，蜀在川西，巴在川东），岷江一带的水灾泛滥，便首当其冲，于是客观条件需要先在岷江着手。这便是李冰要在川西灌县“凿离堆，穿二江成都之中”，而完成都江堰（当时叫做都安堰）的主要原因。李冰既是一位杰出的工程师，他相度地势，观察水情，便先选定灌县这个堰址，这里正是岷江由山溪急流转入平原河槽，比较易于施工的地方。李冰当时所做的工程是极其伟大而简单的，他利用先民多年经验，采取“竹笼装卵石”，编砌成分水堤埂，迎吞水流，叫做“鱼嘴”“鱼嘴”形状如鱼，把岷江分成两股，一为“外江”，一为“内江”。为了畅通“内江”之水以灌溉内地之田，他又开凿了一个山嘴，叫做“离堆”，“鱼嘴”与“离堆”之间，及其附近，还建有“导流”、“平流”诸设备，以促使江水顺流入“内江”（即由都江堰分流入沱江之流），并保持内、外两江一定的水量分配。又在岷江两岸遍开河渠，配备适当的建筑。这样，便形成一个完整的灌溉系统。都江堰系统里，现在包括二百六十多个渠堰，主要灌溉川西成都、灌县、温江、双流、崇庆、新津、彭县、崇宁、郫县、华阳、新繁、新都、金堂、广汉等十四县水田，约达五百万亩。
    都江堰灌溉系统也是世界上最好灌溉系统之一，工程布置均系利用天然形势，干支交错，沟渠纵横，大致上都能做到灌溉排水兼筹并顾，而且在许多干支流中，都有航运之便。建筑材料多系“就地取材”；岁修工程费省工简，所以中外专家学者，到了灌县看了都江堰以后，没有不心悦诚服的。在这个大平原内，由于都江堰的成功，便“水旱从人，不知饥馑，时无荒年，天下谓之天府也”。这个伟大的工程，除了偶然的局部损坏与缺水外，一直存在，为人民服务了二千多年，每年岁修费用还不到每年收益的千分之一。像这样“一本万利”，“天长久地”的福国利民事业，世界上找不出几个来！
  三、都江堰的特点
    都江堰既是一个杰出的伟大工程，自然有它的特点。它的特点就是包含着科学原理与巧妙的工程技术。
    第一，都江堰在规划上是成功的。假使我们把工程计划中的总的规模布置，和周围环境因素的配合等等，叫做规划；把工程计划中的建筑物的结构和局部问题的处理等等，叫做设计；那么，都江堰的工程规划是正确而美满的。用现代的眼光去看，都江堰虽有许多地方需要改进，如沙砾的处理，水流的控制，许多建筑物之需要永久化等，都可用现代科学方法逐步解决。但都江堰所以能维持二千一百多年而不衰弛，实由于李冰父子和当时的许多水利工程师能了解地形，熟悉水情，在规划布置上得到成功。他们选择一个适当的引水地点，又很好的布置了数十条渠道，并且掌握了岷江水流，掌握了成都平原的需要和发展。我们回想当时既无精密的测量仪器，又无有效的施工机械，就不能不佩服他们在规划都江堰工程上的天才成功。因此，李仪祉过去在视察都江堰之后，也主张“规模宜仍旧，只于建筑方法革新”。过去我们往往无选择地崇拜外国专家，以为他们事事比我们强，但都江堰否定了这种想法。这里我们不妨举一个相反的例子，这便是以前华洋义赈会所修的绥远民生渠。就渠道建筑设计方面来讲，民生渠自比都江堰高明些，洋灰三合土的建筑物至今仍有保存完整的。但他们考虑不足，规划不当，犯了不可挽救的错误，这个渠始终未能发挥预期的效益。都江堰所以效益宏大，岁修所费不多，工程寿命长久，主要地都建立在良好规划这个基础之上。
    第二，都江堰在建筑上是富有创造性的。都江堰所用的建筑材料主要为木头、竹子、卵石和土，是一种不折不扣的“土木工程”。用以分水抗流的“竹笼装石”（古称竹落，落与络同）建筑物，既不易破裂，又很沉重，互相牵连，可以受拉受压，放在水里，耐久而不致崩溃。在堰址处，因卵石河床，基地不固，如用块石堆砌“鱼嘴”或堤埂，则一处动摇，随生裂缝，水浸浪刷，必致全局崩坍。这种“竹笼装石工”，据说在汉成帝时（建始五年，河决东郡，泛滥豫兗四郡，一时无法堵复）王延世曾用于黄河，但黄河不比岷江，竹石俱缺，所以王延世没有像李冰的名传千古。再如堵塞江流时所用的“杩槎”，系用三根支木，用竹条绑成三足架，排列一起，再加“竹签”，“竹篱”“菙芭”“簟席”，外堆粘土，成为一种不透水的临时挡水坝。利用“杩槎”这种“断流”设备，岁修工程即可顺利进行，安置、取消也都很容易。这种“土产”“土法”工程，有很大的适应性，是劳动人民多年辛苦的创作，值得我们研究，学习的。
    第三，都江堰的费省效宏，永垂不朽，是几千年来宝贵经验积累而成的结果。都江堰有所谓治水六字诀：“深淘滩，低作堰”，传系李冰所留。因为由“鱼嘴”至“离堆”一段，“内江”时有淤浅，春水时阻塞水流，故需“深淘”，淘至古人所安设在河底的“卧铁”为止，以畅其势。岷江上游水量大的时节，则内江可能进水太多，为安全计，特建“飞沙堰”，“人字堤”等“湃缺”设备（湃缺相当新式工程中之溢流堰），以排泄过量之水，使入“外江”。这些堰堤都安置在沙石河床上，用“竹笼装卵石”，或干脆用卵石堆成，地基不固，所以不能作得过高。又如八字格言：“遇弯截角”，“逢正抽心”，一看即知其为多年治水的经验总结。“遇弯截角”的意思是：河渠弯曲处，凹峰必被淘刷，凸峰必形淤积；“截角”就是除掉凸峰处的淤积，而使弯度减小，这样对峰的崩坍也可停止。这种方法很合乎近代治河原理，且包含有“裁弯取直”的意思。“逢正抽心”，就是将河中淤积部分加以浚渫等于“开挖深泓”，以增加河渠输水能力。无论“六字秘诀”也罢，“八字格言”也罢，绝不是凭空理想出来的东西，也不是李冰一人所创的，而是数千年来，劳动人民和水利工程师实际经验及创作能力的结晶品。
    都江堰，这个继续流动在川西平原的伟大工程，给予我们的是什么？五百万亩的灌溉，二千一百五十年的长期服务，这个利益还不够大吗？是的，这是够大的！但是，我们不应该只看到这些有数字可计的利益；我们更应该珍爱都江堰所给予我们宝贵的遗产，这便是中国古代劳动人民和水利工程师与水奋斗的历史，和他们伟大的杰出的创造能力。
