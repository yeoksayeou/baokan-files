　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: Tokyo news: The Japanese democratic newspaper "Peace Voice" published on January 1st a statement by Shino Etsuro, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party Temporary Central Guidance Department, to reporters. In response to questions, Shino pointed out: "The biggest political issue in Japan now is the peace treaty issue, which is an important issue that determines whether the Japanese people will move towards peace, independence and freedom, or war and colonization." Shino said: Peace, independence, and freedom are what the people of Japan desire. The feelings of 80 million people cannot be ignored by anyone. The power of unity of 80 million people cannot be defeated by anyone. For the sake of a comprehensive peace, the unity of the people is urgently needed at present. Shino also pointed out that the Korean War showed the world that the power of peace-loving people is stronger than the power of warmongers. "The power of peace-loving people is not only to defend world peace, but also to guarantee the independence, freedom and life of the Japanese nation."
    When asked by reporters what efforts the Communist Party should make for a comprehensive peace, Shino replied: A comprehensive peace is a movement of the people of the whole country, not just a movement of the Communist Party alone. Needless to say, the Communist Party will do its best for this movement, and at the same time hopes that the Socialist Party, the General Federation of Japanese Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and various industrial trade union units that advocate a comprehensive peace will participate in launching a broad national movement. Shino said: "If this movement is launched, it will surely achieve great results; at the same time, 1951 will also become a year full of hope and light for the Japanese nation."
    Shino exposed the conspiracy of the so-called "supra-partisan diplomacy" and "cabinet of national unity" between Japanese conservative parties, saying: There are only two political stances in Japan at present: one is to rely on a comprehensive peace to achieve peace, independence and freedom, and the other is to sell out Japan in the name of a separate peace, a majority peace, etc., to achieve colonization. The reactionary forces headed by the Liberal Party are concentrating their efforts on signing a treasonous treaty. The so-called supra-partisan diplomacy and cabinet of national unity are their dispatching work to gather treasonous forces. The Socialist Party's resolution advocates a comprehensive peace, and the reactionaries attack it as a policy of tolerating communism. This is also one of the tasks of the reactionaries, who use this to coerce the wavering elements within the Socialist Party to violate the Socialist Party's advocacy of a comprehensive peace. Shino emphasized: However, no matter what coercive tricks are used, such a treasonous policy will inevitably be defeated by the people's resolute opposition.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: According to the United Press, the "Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council," which was recently formed by the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party Reconstruction Faction, and more than sixty other democratic groups, sent an open letter to Dulles in late January. The letter pointed out: "The Japanese working people clearly oppose a separate peace and rearmament," and demanded the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty including the new China and the Soviet Union, and opposed the continued stationing of US troops in Japan after the peace treaty. The letter said: A separate peace can never guarantee the Japanese people true independence, peace, and stable and improved lives. The letter also reminded Dulles to pay attention to the lives and true feelings of the increasingly impoverished Japanese workers, farmers, small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, the unemployed, war widows and orphans, and to pay attention to the will they expressed in the comprehensive peace vote.
    In addition: Kobe City, with local democratic groups and cultural figures as the center, is organizing the local "Comprehensive Peace Patriotic Movement Council." The preparatory committee of the association has been established, and the initiators include: Kishimoto Katsumi of the Peace Protection Association, Mizutani, secretary-general of the Kobe branch of the National Railway Workers' Union, and Professor Kobayashi of Kobe University.

    号召全民团结展开全面媾和运动        
    日全面媾和爱国运动协议会反对重新武装日本
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：日本民主报纸《和平之声》曾于一月一日刊载日本共产党临时中央指导部主席椎野悦郎向记者发表的谈话。椎野在答问中指出：“现在日本最大的政治问题是和约问题，这是决定日本人民走向和平、独立与自由，还是战争与殖民地化的重要问题。”椎野说：和平、独立、自由三者是日本全国人民所希求的。八千万人民的感情是任何人也不能忽视的。八千万人民团结的力量是任何人也不能打败的。为了全面媾和，全国人民的团结是当前迫切必要的事。椎野并指出：朝鲜战争中昭示了世界，爱好和平人民的力量比战争贩子们的力量强大。“爱好和平的人民的力量不独是保卫世界和平的，也是保障日本民族独立、自由与生活的力量”。
    当记者问到共产党为了全面媾和应做那些努力时，椎野答称：全面媾和是全国人民的运动，绝非共产党一党的运动。不消说，共产党将为这个运动竭尽全力以赴，同时并期望主张全面媾和的社会党、日本工会总同盟、日本工会总评议会、各产业工会单位等参加展开一个广大的国民运动。椎野说：“倘若这一运动展开，必能获得极大成果；同时，一九五一年也将成为日本民族充满希望与光明的一年。”
    椎野揭露日本保守政党之间的所谓“超党派外交”、“举国一致内阁”的阴谋说：目前日本的政治立场只有两个：一是依靠全面媾和达到和平、独立与自由，一是以单独媾和，多数媾和等名义出卖日本而达到殖民地化。以自由党为首的反动势力正集中力量于签订卖国的和约，现在所谓超党派外交、举国一致内阁是它们为了纠集卖国势力的调度工作。社会党决议主张全面媾和，反动派就攻击说这是容共政策。这也是反动派的工作之一，反动派以此胁迫社会党内部的动摇分子，使其违背社会党全面媾和的主张。椎野强调说：但是，这样的卖国政策，无论其用何种胁迫的伎俩，必将由于人民的坚决反对而遭到失败。
    【新华社十三日讯】据联合通讯社消息：日本共产党、劳农党、社会党再建派以及其他共计六十多个民主团体最近组成的“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”，曾在一月下旬致杜勒斯公开信一件。信中指出：“日本劳动人民群众很明显地反对单独媾和与重新武装”，并要求早日缔结包括新中国和苏联在内的全面和约，反对媾和后美军继续驻扎日本。信中说：单独媾和决不能保证日本人民有真正的独立、和平与生活的安定和改善。该信并提醒杜勒斯注意日益贫困的日本工人、农民、中小工商业者、失业者、战争寡妇与孤儿等的生活与真实感情，注意他们在全面媾和投票中所表明的意志。
    又讯：神户市以当地的民主团体与文化人等为中心，正在进行组织该地的“全面媾和爱国运动协议会”。该会筹备会业已成立，发起人包括：保卫和平之会的岸本克己、国营铁路工会神户支部总书记水谷、神户大学教授古林等人。
