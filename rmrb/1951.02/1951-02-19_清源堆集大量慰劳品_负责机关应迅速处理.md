    A Large Quantity of Comfort Goods Piled Up in Qingyuan; Responsible Authorities Should Handle it Promptly

    To the Editor:

    Around the Spring Festival, comfort goods dedicated to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, as well as relief supplies for Korean refugees, were collected throughout the country. Qingyuan County, Shanxi Province, also launched a donation campaign, with people from all walks of life donating funds or goods. However, the goods donated by everyone (daily necessities, food, etc.) have been piled up in the county's Cultural Center for over a month now, and the responsible authorities have not yet forwarded them to the Korean front lines.

    I believe that collecting comfort and relief goods is one of the practical actions of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. It is wrong for the authorities responsible for this work in Qingyuan County not to pay attention to this. They should know that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting in the icy and snowy conditions to defend world peace and the security of our motherland; the Korean people have suffered the ravages of the American aggressors and are living in great hardship. We should send comfort and relief goods to them as soon as possible.

                                                Ding Heling

### 清源堆集大量慰劳品  负责机关应迅速处理

    清源堆集大量慰劳品  负责机关应迅速处理编辑同志：
    春节前后，全国各地都募集了献给中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军的慰劳品及给朝鲜难民的救济品。山西省清源县也展开了募集运动，各界同胞纷纷捐出款项或物品。但是大家所捐的物品（日用品、食品等），堆集在本县文化馆内，至今月余，负责机关仍未转送朝鲜前线。
    我认为：募集慰劳品和救济品是抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动之一。清源县负责此项工作的机关对此毫不重视是不应该的。应当知道：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军正在冰天雪地里为保卫世界和平与我们祖国安全而斗争着；朝鲜人民遭受了美国侵略者的残害，生活非常困苦；我们应该把慰劳品，救济品赶快送给他们才对。
