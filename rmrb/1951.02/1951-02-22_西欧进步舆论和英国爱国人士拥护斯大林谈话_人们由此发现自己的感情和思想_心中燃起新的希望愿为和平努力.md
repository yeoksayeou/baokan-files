Xinhua News Agency, 20th: A compilation of TASS dispatches: Progressive public opinion in Western European countries warmly supports Stalin's speech to a Pravda correspondent.

The Italian newspaper Unità commented on Stalin's speech, saying: Stalin's words have been confirmed by the life and policies of the Soviet Union. These facts have been stated so clearly that ordinary people all over the world can understand them, and unscrupulous politicians who are keen to make war speeches will not be able to use their tricks. People everywhere in the world will find their feelings and thoughts in this speech. This conversation will ignite new hopes in the hearts of every good man and woman and will become a guide to action. The Italian people, who cherish the destiny of their motherland, will redouble their efforts for the cause of peace. Unità said: Italian democratic organizations are doing everything possible to distribute millions of leaflets and pamphlets printed with Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent as soon as possible.

Avanti! published an editorial written by Senator Pedini, stating: Stalin knows that the people's will to strive for peace is the force that can truly stop war. Stalin's profound understanding of the interests of all mankind has made the leading role that history has given to the Soviet Union in the struggle for complete liberation that is being carried out by the working people of all countries in the world increasingly obvious and important.

The Finnish newspaper Worker and the Free Word newspaper both published the full text of Stalin's speech. The Worker commented: The opinions expressed in Comrade Stalin's speech encouraged the progressive newspapers' struggle against war instigators and their lying propaganda. The Free Word newspaper emphasized: Comrade Stalin's speech is of historical importance and provides a program for the struggle for lasting world peace.

The Dutch newspaper De Waarheid and several other Dutch newspapers published the full text of Stalin's speech. De Waarheid's headline read: "A broad movement to defend peace is of the greatest significance. If the people take on the cause of peace, there will be no war."

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: TASS Moscow, 19th: Pravda published Mayevsky's dispatch from London stating: British public attention is focused on Stalin's speech. All newspapers published the full text of the speech or summaries from foreign news agencies under prominent headlines. On buses, in subways, and on the streets, thousands of people read newspapers and exchanged opinions.

Mayevsky cited a statement given to him by the Very Reverend Johnson, Dean of Canterbury and President of the British-Soviet Friendship Society, for publication in Pravda. The statement said: Stalin's speech is calm, logical, and clear. It is like a breath of fresh air, blowing away the smog and lying propaganda spread by the enemies of peace. It struck at Attlee's attempt to justify Britain's new massive arms program, exposed Attlee's mask, and, I think, made him feel ashamed. Stalin once again very clearly demonstrated the Soviet Union's desire for peace. The statement also said that Attlee knew the real situation in the Soviet Union, but preferred to repeat all the malicious slanders fabricated by the enemies of socialism, the trade union movement, freedom, and democracy. Johnson emphasized in conclusion that we must live in peace with the great Soviet Union. We can live in peace with the Soviet Union. However, we must make our voices heard before the roar of cannons drowns out the voices of peace and humanity.

Mayevsky also cited a statement by Platts-Mills, a prominent British figure and Chairman of the National Council of the British-Soviet Friendship Society, stating: Every man and woman who believes in the future of Britain and therefore fights for peace cannot but cheer Stalin's statement. This is one of the clearest assessments of the international situation made by a great leader in the post-war years. This statement leaves those in the West who are trying to drag us into war with no defense.

Mayevsky wrote: Stalin's interview with a Pravda correspondent has opened the eyes of millions of people, received a warm response from true patriots in Britain, and mobilized them to fight for peace and for the future of Britain. Mayevsky pointed out that the British ruling group has taken every measure to flood the people with a torrent of anti-Soviet lies and slander. The British Foreign Office has fabricated a "statement" on Stalin's speech. Every line and every word of this statement proves that British rulers, for the sake of the insatiable profits of monopolies, are attempting to plunge the people into an abyss of suffering and disaster by means of blatant lies. Mayevsky concluded: However, no one can suppress this speech that speaks the great truth. This conversation now and in the future calls on the people of all countries to carry out an unyielding struggle for peace.

　　西欧进步舆论和英国爱国人士拥护斯大林谈话
    人们由此发现自己的感情和思想  心中燃起新的希望愿为和平努力
    【新华社二十日讯】综合塔斯社讯：西欧各国进步舆论热烈拥护斯大林对真理报记者所发表的谈话。
    意大利团结报评论斯大林谈话称：斯大林的话已被苏联的生活和政策证实。这些事实已被说得这样明白，全世界普通人民都能够了解，孜孜于发表战争言论的丧尽天良的政客，将无法施展其伎俩。世界上一切地方的人民，都将在这一谈话中发现自己的感情和思想。这一谈话将在每一个善良的男女心中燃起新的希望，并成为行动的指南。珍视祖国的命运的意大利人民将加倍为和平事业而努力。团结报说：意大利各民主组织正在尽一切可能尽速散发数百万份印有斯大林对真理报记者的谈话的传单和小册子。
    前进报发表参议员裴丁尼所撰写的社论称：斯大林知道人民争取和平的意志是真正能够制止战争的力量。斯大林这样深刻地了解全人类的利益，已使得历史在全世界一切国家的劳动人民正在进行的争取完全解放的斗争中所赋予苏联的领导作用，变得愈来愈加明显和重要。
    芬兰工人报及自由谈报都全文刊载斯大林的谈话。工人报评论说：斯大林同志谈话中所表示的意见，鼓舞了进步报纸对战争煽动者及其说谎宣传所进行的斗争。自由谈报强调指出：斯大林同志的谈话，具有历史重要性，并提供了争取世界持久和平的斗争纲领。
    荷兰真理报及荷兰其他若干报纸全文刊载了斯大林的谈话。真理报的大字标题为：“广泛的维护和平运动具有最重大的意义。如果人民把和平事业担当起来，那就不会有战争。”
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报刊载马耶夫斯基的伦敦电讯称：英国公众的注意力集中在斯大林发表的谈话上。所有的报纸都在通栏标题下刊载谈话的全文或外国通讯社的摘要。在公共汽车中、地下电车里和在街道上，成千的人读着报纸，并交换着意见。
    马耶夫斯基援引英苏友好协会会长坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊交给他的供真理报发表的声明。声明说：斯大林的谈话是冷静的、合乎逻辑的、明确的。它像一阵新鲜的风，吹散了和平的敌人所散布的乌烟瘴气和说谎的宣传。它打击了艾德礼想为英国新的庞大的军备计划辩解的企图，揭破了艾德礼的面具，并且，我认为，使他感到可耻。斯大林又一次十分清楚地证明了苏联的和平愿望。声明又说，艾德礼知道苏联的真实情况，但却宁愿重复社会主义、工会运动、自由和民主的敌人所捏造的一切恶意的诽谤。约翰逊在结语中着重指出，我们必须与伟大的苏联和平相处。我们能够与苏联和平相处。但是，我们必须在大炮的吼声淹没和平与人道的声音以前，使我们的呼声被听到。
    马耶夫斯基又援引英国著名人士、英苏友好协会全国理事会主席普拉茨—米尔斯的声明称：每一个相信英国的前途，因而为和平而斗争的男女，都不能不为斯大林的声明欢呼。这是伟大领袖之一在战后年代中对国际形势所作的最明确的估计。这个声明使西方那些企图把我们拖入战争的人们无以自辩。
    马耶夫斯基写道：斯大林对真理报记者的谈话，打开了千百万人的眼睛，在英国的真正的爱国人士中得到热烈的响应，并使他们动员起来，为和平、为英国的前途而斗争。马耶夫斯基指出：英国统治集团采取了一切措施用反苏谎言与诽谤捏造的洪流来淹没人民。英国外交部已就斯大林的谈话，制造了一篇“声明”。这一声明的每一行每一个字，都证明英国统治者为了贪得无餍的垄断企业的利润，企图凭借弥天大谎把人民投入苦难与灾祸的深渊中。马耶夫斯基结语说：但是，没有人能够压制这一道出伟大真理的谈话。这一谈话现在和将来都在号召各国人民为争取和平而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
