In Seoul
By our correspondents Chao Qi and Li Zhuang

When the Korean People's Army withdrew from Seoul in September of last year, they solemnly vowed: "We will return." On January 4th of this year, they indeed returned victoriously with the collaboration of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Seoul has once again returned to the hands of the brave Korean people, and Seoul has once again demonstrated that it is a city that will never yield.

Although the Americans destroyed eighty percent of Seoul's buildings, and although this city, which originally had 1.8 million people (or 1.5 million according to one account), now has only 63,000 people temporarily, Seoul has triumphed. Despite the enemy's frantic destruction and the twenty-four-hour daily air raids on Seoul, refugees still return to Seoul every day, every hour. The people who remain in Seoul have become very silent, brave, and determined. Although the myriad glories of the setting sun shining on the Han River have temporarily faded, and the flowers and trees in the old palaces of the Yi Dynasty have also temporarily withered, the pine trees covered in snow appear all the more profound, firm, and powerful. The peaks in the city, wearing white snow caps, stand proudly in the cold, clear sky. Seoul is indestructible.

The American-Rhee bandit gang constructed three lines of defense in Seoul, with the original "38th parallel" as Line A, the Uijeongbu-Chuncheon line as Line B, and the Han River as Line C. Fortunately, there are many letters in the English alphabet, otherwise it would be difficult to calculate the defense lines. However, our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army launched a full-scale offensive on a 500-li front on New Year's Eve last year, breaking through Line A in a matter of hours. The enemy was defeated again and again, and quickly retreated south of Suwon (Line D). Seoul was liberated on January 4th, exactly one hundred days after the first withdrawal. One hundred days is not a long time, but in Seoul, it is a historical epic interwoven with blood, tears, pain, and struggle.

	I. The Special Self-Defense Force

On September 20th of last year, the Americans advanced to the outskirts of Seoul. An alarm sounded in the streets of Seoul: "The enemy is approaching." The enemy occupied Yeongdeungpo (Seoul's industrial area) south of the Han River on the 18th, and occupied Lanji Island in the Han River on the 20th. They immediately shifted their main force and launched a fierce attack on northwest Seoul, attempting to cut off the transport line from Seoul to Pyongyang and annihilate the People's Army guarding Seoul in one fell swoop.

The Korean People's Army defended Seoul valiantly and heroically, earning a reputation around the world. Incheon is only seventy li from Seoul. The enemy, with a force twenty times larger than the People's Army, coordinated their attacks with aircraft, tanks, and artillery, and it took them fifteen days and the sacrifice of 15,000 lives to enter Seoul. The People's Army guarding Seoul wrote an immortal and glorious history for their country. The people of Seoul also demonstrated amazing determination and perseverance in this defense battle.

On the night of the 21st, 200,000 Seoul residents poured into the suburbs and streets, using beams and sandbags to build barricades. At this time, American soldiers bombarded the city with long-range artillery, and many houses caught fire. Many men and women citizens participating in the construction of the barricades fell to the ground. However, the fortifications continued to be thickened and heightened. Overnight, the barricades were completely built. The Special Self-Defense Force rushed to deploy defenses.

The Special Self-Defense Force was a thorough and complete people's armed force. On August 15th of last year, under the leadership of the Seoul City Party Committee of the Workers' Party, the Seoul City Special Self-Defense Force was established. The city directly administered one battalion, and each of the nine districts had one battalion, for a total of ten battalions with more than 400 people. Participants were all workers and party members. The Special Self-Defense Force underwent short-term military training. On September 17th of last year – after the enemy landed in Incheon – the Special Self-Defense Force immediately expanded to more than a thousand people, and many non-Party activists joined. All the队员 [duìyuán - team members] had never fought in a war, but they all had a determination to defend their homeland to the death. They learned as they fought, which is the characteristic of a people's armed force. The commanders of the Special Self-Defense Force were all guerrilla fighters, such as Li Douhuan, the commander of the first battalion, Yu Douyuan, the commander of the second battalion, and Liu Dayuan, the chief of staff of the city-administered battalion, who were all outstanding guerrilla fighters from Mount Taebaek.

In the beginning, the Special Self-Defense Force only had two kinds of weapons: spears and hand grenades made from canned food containers. By the third day of the battle, the soldiers had all replaced them with new-style American carbines with selective fire.

Hongje-dong is located in the northwest suburbs of Seoul, on the main road from Seoul to Pyongyang. A small area of houses was built on a valley road thirty meters wide. The valley road is guarded by two high grounds, Ansan and Inwangsan. The barricade was built between the two high grounds and guarded by more than forty members of the Special Self-Defense Force. To the left of Hongje-dong was the Shinchon barricade, which was guarded by the People's Army.

On the 22nd, enemy aircraft bombed Seoul fiercely. Squadrons of forty or fifty B-29s wreaked havoc in shifts every hour. The enemy's long-range artillery coordinated with the bombing, turning Seoul into a sea of ​​fire. At night, flares floated over Hongje-dong, and the battlefield was as bright as day. Smoke and fire filled the air, and the sound of bombs and artillery shells was deafening. After a long period of artillery preparation, the Americans, under the cover of the intense light of the flares, charged towards Hongje-dong with tanks leading the way. The Special Self-Defense Force lay in ambush in the barricade, waiting for the enemy to approach, first attacking the tanks with hand grenades, and then launching a bayonet charge. When the enemy saw that the defenders in the barricade had not all been killed, they immediately retreated in a panic and began artillery preparation again. This was repeated several times.

The Hongje-dong position was held until the 25th. More and more defenders fought, and nearby residents automatically joined the battle. The barricades were repaired as soon as they were bombed and always stood firmly on the enemy's path. The Minqing [Democratic Youth League] and Women's League led the masses to transport and take care of the wounded. Housewives prepared rice, put it in cans, and carried it on their heads to the front line. When the cans were broken by artillery shell fragments, they immediately ran home to replace them with new ones. At this time, the equipment of the Special Self-Defense Force had been completely improved, becoming uniform carbines. The enemy advanced to the front of the barricade during the day and confronted the Self-Defense Force, and at night the Self-Defense Force raided, drove away the enemy, and collected weapons.

On the night of the 25th, the enemy shifted its main force, crossed the Han River, and entered the city from the south. The defenders of the barricades gradually moved to the city area and engaged in mixed battles with the enemy. This was a real mixed battle, with enemies everywhere, People's Army and armed people everywhere, gunfire everywhere, and smoke and fire everywhere. By the 27th, after the Special Self-Defense Force destroyed four enemy tanks, it was forced to join the People's Army and detoured north of Seoul at night, advancing to Mount Bukhan, fifteen li from Seoul, and established a small base.

This is a miracle, but it has become a very common fact. This kind of fact occurred between the bravest people and the least brave enemy. In a week of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties; the Special Self-Defense Force also suffered heroic sacrifices. Many responsible persons of the city and district party organizations of the Workers' Party also sacrificed themselves while leading the masses in the charge. The martyrs who defended Seoul are immortal!

	II. Seoul Falls into Terror

Seoul was shrouded in terror when it was occupied by the enemy. People all knew that American imperialism was the most brutal, but who would have thought that they would be so brutal?

On the night of the enemy's entry into the city, on the one hand, they formed a "security team" composed of military police and reactionary elements who had massacred the people during the Japanese puppet regime to suppress the people; on the other hand, they began to search and arrest people who had moved their residence after June 28th – the day of Seoul's first liberation – and those who had served in the People's Army, and frantically announced: all military police organs, special agent organizations, and reactionary groups could arrest and kill people at any time. Young people with shaved heads were arrested because the soldiers of the People's Army had shaved heads. Women carrying bundles were arrested because they may have been moving their residence. More than 600 streetcar workers were arrested because they had warmly welcomed the People's Army. In the first three days, all the prisons, police stations, and reactionary groups were filled with "prisoners," and the enemy had no choice but to turn schools, churches, and movie theaters into prisons.

We talked to many people who had witnessed the enemy's atrocities with their own eyes. A gaunt middle-aged man named Zhao told us that the enemy used all kinds of the most barbaric methods to kill those who were arrested. The thirty-one-year-old streetcar union chairman, Ze Renfeng, had his limbs nailed to upright wooden boards and then stabbed to death with bayonets. Three young men who were considered "red bandits" were tied to the back of a tank with ropes and dragged through the streets for three hours until they died. In a small alley in Dongdaemun District, a citizen named Li Jixie told us that on October 8th, he personally saw the puppet "security team" of Pocheon Town, under the command of an American military officer, tie an innocent young man to a wooden pillar and stab him to death with an iron fork used by farmers to rake manure, and then cut off his arms. The American devils standing beside them were busy taking pictures and drinking for fun. The next day, this "security team" caught sixteen male and female farmers from the vicinity, first gouged out their eyes, then cut their tongues, and then cut off their noses. The women also had their breasts cut off. When the sixteen half-dead bodies were still rolling on the grass, these beasts staggered away.

The enemy's cruelty and barbarism are truly too numerous to recount. In the one hundred days that they ruled Seoul, more than 43,000 people were killed. This is still a very incomplete statistic. Japanese imperialism had massacred thousands upon thousands of patriots in Mapo Prison; today, we have again found there the bloody evidence of the large-scale massacre of peaceful residents by American imperialism. In the gloomy corners of the house, there were piles of tens of thousands of bloody clothes and shoes. These clothes were for men and women; most of them were the clothes of Korean civilians, occasionally mixed with some old suits. From this, we know that the vast majority of the victims were workers, peasants, and urban poor. A jailer who was still there told us that the victims had no food or clothing, suffered from cold and hunger, and were also subjected to inhumane torture. The screams in the prison shook the sky, and no less than seventy or eighty people were beaten to death every day. We didn't find the bodies. The corpses had been thrown into the Han River by the bandits.

American imperialism tried every means to create hunger and death. During the first liberation of Seoul, the People's Government had issued 1,000-won currency. After the bandits entered the city, they bought all the supplies, and then announced: anyone with a 1,000-won bill would be beheaded! People burned the bills. The bandits then ordered the people to deposit the remaining bills (including the counterfeit bills they had issued themselves) in the bank in order to use the people's blood and sweat to do business. The bandits were afraid that the people would not starve to death. Except for factories such as streetcars, railways, and clothing that were useful to them, all other factories were closed, institutions were closed, and schools were also closed. Workers lost their jobs, office workers also lost their jobs, and students lost their schooling. The property of tens of thousands of arrested and killed people was confiscated, and their wives and children were driven out of their homes, helpless, suffering from cold and hunger. Children became beggars; women were forced into prostitution. Syngman Rhee not only sold out the beautiful mountains and rivers of South Korea but also sold out the chastity of Korean women to please the American aggressors. In Seongbuk-ri and Eunjin-ri, they arrested 300 women at a time and handed them over to the invading army.

American imperialism's destruction of culture reached the point of perfection. When Hitler visited the "German Painting Exhibition" in Munich in 1937, he personally tore up the famous paintings he didn't like. But he couldn't catch up with the American invading army. The Americans destroyed the Seoul Science Museum and turned the museum into a bar and brothel. This is truly the greatest insult to human culture.

	III. Seoul is Unyielding

Seoul is an unyielding city. Although the American-Rhee bandit gang occupied it, they could not insult its soul. Existing alongside the atrocities of American imperialism was the unyielding struggle of the people.

In a room in Gye-dong in Seongbuk, we saw two young girls wearing Korean national costumes. One was named Bian Zhouxuan, twenty-two years old; one was named Xue Zhenyuan, twenty years old. They are two of the thousands of fighters who are united around the Workers' Party and struggling hard with the enemy. They all have their own ideals. Zhouxuan studied at a nursing school for two years and plans to be a nurse for the people in the future. Zhenyuan is studying in middle school and plans to go to university for further studies in the future. However, American imperialism shattered their ideals. The school was closed, and the family was so poor that they had no food to eat. They found work in a laundry. There, they participated in the underground struggle organized by the Workers' Party. They used various opportunities to publicize to the people the situation of the People's Army's certain victory, expose the enemy's slanderous propaganda against the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and mobilize the people to help the guerrillas. Although many comrades sacrificed themselves in their work, they were not afraid and continued to fight until liberation.

The enemy's cruelty aroused the people's indignation. The enemy's newspapers often published news of this kind: a young man was arrested and killed because he wanted to snipe the Vice-Chairman of the National Assembly, Zang Zexiang; a young man was executed by firing squad because he sniped the Deputy Minister of National Defense; the police station in Miha-ri was attacked, the power lines in ×× were destroyed, and so on. The enemy wanted to use executions to scare the people, but those who fight for freedom are not afraid of death. When the people heard the news that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army had appeared on the Korean battlefield and had driven the enemy into a series of defeats, their fighting will and confidence in victory increased even more. Comrade Zhao Nanjin of the Seoul City Workers' Party told us that in the ten days or so before the liberation of Seoul, groups of women secretly climbed over Mount Bukak at night carrying food, clothing, and socks to the guerrillas. Many people were killed on the way by the enemy's "mountain forest surveillance team," but people still continued to move forward at the risk of their lives. They continued to fight until victory.

	IV. Seoul Today

When the Korean People's Army first liberated Seoul, they were ordered not to use heavy artillery in order to protect this lovely city. When our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul this time, they adopted the tactics of rapid attack and fierce pursuit, also in order to prevent the enemy from gaining a foothold and protect this lovely city. However, Seoul is already devastated. The Americans robbed everything useful in Seoul. A People's Army officer told us, "They even swept away the dust." At the same time, the Americans forced all residents to retreat south, claiming that "those who don't leave are all red bandits and will be killed without mercy."

As soon as Seoul was liberated, there were no people and no supplies, and it was extremely difficult to resume work.

However, no matter what difficulties there are, Seoul is still unyielding.

We saw women and children collecting surviving grains and clothing in the rubble and ruins, and using wooden boards to build small houses to shelter from the wind and snow beside the broken walls. We saw residents covering the enemy's propaganda of "Welcome the United Nations Army" with slogans such as "Long Live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" and "Long Live the People's Republic of China." We saw groups of refugees rushing back to their capital, ignoring the enemy's strafing and bombing. We saw the bimonthly *Liberation Daily* published, with ten workers responsible for all the typesetting and printing of the newspaper. We saw workers in a semi-starved state guarding surviving machines, and some factories had only one or two people left, but they had to undertake heavy tasks such as preventing spies, preventing fires, and preventing theft.

We visited a certain person in charge of the Seoul City Workers' Party. He said: The resumption of work is proceeding gradually. Most of the district and street governments and party organizations have been restored. The government is making every effort to solve the food problem for the troops, organs, and residents, and at the same time vigorously sort out state property and protect private property. Government staff even nailed up doors and windows for those who had fled and had not returned. Three orphanages have been established in Seoul to accommodate and raise the orphans of the martyrs who died in the disaster. He said: The government is vigorously recruiting workers and preparing to restore electricity, tap water, and streetcars. Other industries will also be restored as soon as possible.

Seoul's disaster is not over yet, but it is nearing its end. Seoul has its own glorious past and also has a bright future. The people of Seoul say with confidence: "The future belongs to us."

### 在汉城

　　在汉城
    本报记者  超琪  李庄
    朝鲜人民军在去年九月撤离汉城时，曾经庄严地宣誓：“我们还要回来。”今年一月四日，他们在中国人民志愿部队协同作战之下，果然胜利回来了。汉城再一次归于勇敢的朝鲜人民手中，汉城再一次表现了它是一个永不屈服的城市。
    尽管美国人把汉城的房屋破坏了百分之八十。尽管这个原有一百八十万人口（一说一百五十万）的城市，现在暂时只有六万三千人。但是汉城胜利了。不顾敌人的疯狂破坏和每日空袭汉城二十四小时，但逃难者还是每日每时移回汉城。留居汉城的人民，已变得非常沉默、勇敢和坚毅。虽然夕阳斜照在汉江水面上的万种光辉暂时消退了，李朝故宫中的花木也暂时凋谢了，但与大雪掩映着的苍松，却显得加倍的深沉、坚挺、有力，市内诸峰，戴着洁白的雪帽子，傲然挺立在冰冷的晴空中，汉城是不可摧毁的。
    美李匪帮在汉城曾经构筑了三道防线，以原“三八线”为Ａ线，议政府至春川一线为Ｂ线，汉江为Ｃ线。幸喜英文字母甚多，否则防线将很难计算了。但我人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军协同于去年除夕，在五百里战线上发动全面进攻，数小时即突破Ａ线。敌人一败再败，很快就退到水原（Ｄ线）以南去了。汉城于一月四日解放，距离第一次撤守，恰恰是一百天。一百天的时间并不长，在汉城，却是血泪交织着的痛苦与斗争的史篇。
            一、特别自卫队
    去年九月二十日，美国人进至汉城四周。汉城街头响起警报：“敌人逼近了。”敌人于十八日侵占汉江以南的永登浦（为汉城的工业区），于二十日侵占汉江中的兰芝岛，立即调移主力，猛攻汉城西北，企图截断汉城至平壤的运输线，一举歼灭守卫汉城的人民军。
    朝鲜人民军保卫汉城，壮烈英勇，名震世界。仁川到汉城不过七十里，敌人以大于人民军二十倍的兵力，飞机、坦克、大炮配合猛攻，费时十五天，付出一万五千条性命的代价，才进入汉城。守卫汉城的人民军替自己的祖国写下了千古不磨的光荣史迹，汉城的人民在这个保卫战中，也表现了惊人的决心和毅力。
    二十一日夜间，二十万汉城人民涌至城郊、街头，用梁木和砂袋建筑街垒。此时，美国兵以长距离炮向市内猛轰，许多房屋起火，参加修筑街垒的男女市民，纷纷倒在地上。但是，工事继续加厚增高，一夜工夫，街垒完全筑成了。特别自卫队赶来布防。
    特别自卫队是彻头彻尾的人民武装。去年八月十五日，在劳动党汉城市党的组织领导下，成立了汉城市特别自卫队。市直属一个营，九个区各有一个营，十个营共有四百余人，参加者都是工人、党员。特别自卫队实行过短期的军事训练。去年九月十七日——敌在仁川登陆后，特别自卫队立刻发展到千余人，许多非党的积极分子参加进来。所有队员都没有打过仗，但都有一颗誓死保家卫国的决心。他们边打边学，这正是人民武装的特色。特别自卫队的指挥员都是打过游击的，如一营营长李斗焕，二营营长鱼斗源，市直属营参谋长柳达渊，都是太白山出色的游击战士。
    开始，特别自卫队的武器只有两种：梭标和用罐头筒作成的手榴弹。战斗到第三天，战士们都换成带快慢机的新式美国卡宾枪了。
    弘济院在汉城西北郊，为汉城通平壤大路。在一个三十米宽的谷道上，修有一小片房屋。谷道左右有鞍山、仁旺山两高地拱卫着。街垒修在两个高地中间，由四十多个特别自卫队守卫着。弘济院左边是新村街垒，由人民军守卫。
    二十二日，敌机猛炸汉城。四、五十架的Ｂ二十九大编队轮番肆虐，每小时换一次班。敌人的长距离炮配合轰击，把汉城烧成火海。入夜，照明弹飘在弘济院上空，战场明如白昼。烟火弥漫，炸弹与炮弹声震耳欲聋。美国人经过长期的火力准备，照明弹的强烈光芒掩护，以坦克为前导，向弘济院冲击。特别自卫队伏在街垒中，等敌人逼近了，先用手榴弹猛击坦克，接着以梭标冲锋。敌人看到街垒中的保卫者没有全被打死，立刻狼狈退却，再开始火力准备。如此反复了好几次。
    弘济院的阵地一直坚持到二十五日。守卫者越打越多，附近居民纷纷自动参加战斗。街垒随炸随修，始终屹立在敌人的前进路上。民青和女盟带领群众，运送与照顾伤员。主妇们作好大米饭，用罐子盛着，顶在头上往火线上送。罐子被炮弹破片打碎了，立刻跑回家来，再换一个新的。这时候，特别自卫队的装备已经完全改善了，变成清一色的卡宾枪。敌人白天进到街垒前面和自卫队对峙，夜间自卫队突击，赶跑敌人，收集武器。
    二十五日夜间，敌人转移主力，渡过汉江，从南面进入市区。各个街垒的保卫者逐步向市区转移，和敌人混战。这是真正的混战，到处都有敌人，到处都有人民军和武装的人民，到处都是枪声，到处都是烟火。至二十七日，特别自卫队击毁敌人四辆坦克以后，被迫和人民军会合，乘夜绕道到汉城以北，进至距汉城十五里的北汉山，建立了一个小小的根据地。
    这是奇迹，但是它已成为很平常的事实了。这种事实是在最勇敢的人民和最不勇敢的敌人之间发生的。一周激战中，敌人伤亡重大；特别自卫队也蒙受了壮烈的牺牲。劳动党市、区党组织的许多负责人，也在率众冲锋时牺牲了。保卫汉城的烈士们是永垂不朽的！
            二、汉城陷于恐怖中
    被敌人侵占时的汉城笼罩着恐怖。人们都知道美帝国主义是最残暴的，但是，谁能想到他们竟残暴到这种地步呢？
    敌人进城的当天晚上，一方面把日伪时期屠杀人民的军警和反动分子组成了“治安队”来镇压人民；一方面开始搜捕六月二十八日——汉城第一次解放的日子——以后迁移住址的人和曾为人民军服务过的人，并且疯狂宣布：一切军警机关、特务组织和反动团体可以随时捕杀人民。剪光头的青年人被捕了，因为人民军的战士是剪光头的。拿包袱的妇女被捕了，因为她们可能是迁移住址。六百多个电车工人被捕了，因为他们曾经热烈地欢迎人民军。在开始的三天内，所有的牢狱、警察局、反动团体都装满了“犯人”，敌人不得不把学校、教堂、电影院变成了监狱。
    我们和许多亲眼看见敌人暴行的人谈话。一位脸庞消瘦的姓赵的中年人告诉我们：敌人用各式各样最野蛮的方法来杀害被捕的人。三十一岁的电车工会委员长泽仁凤，四肢被钉在竖起的木板上，然后用刺刀刺死。三个被认为“赤匪”的青年，被敌人用绳子捆着绑在坦克后面，拖着游街，三小时而死。在东大门区的一条小巷里，一位叫做李基爕的市民告诉我们：十月八日，他亲眼看见抱川镇伪“治安队”在美军军官指挥下，把一个无辜的青年拴在木柱上，用农民耙粪用的铁叉刺死，然后又把两只臂膀砍下来。站在旁边的美国鬼子则忙着照相，喝酒取乐。次日，这个“治安队”又把附近的十六个男女农民捉来，先挖眼，次割舌头，再割鼻子，妇女还要割奶子。十六颗半生半死的身躯还在草地上翻滚的时候，这群野兽就跚跚地走开了。
    敌人的残暴与野蛮实是罄竹难书。在他们统治汉城的一百天内，有四万三千余人被杀。这还是一个极不完全的统计。日本帝国主义曾在麻浦监狱屠杀成千成万的爱国者；今天，我们又在那里找到了美帝国主义大批屠杀和平居民的血证。在阴森森的屋角里，堆积着上万件的血衣和鞋子。这些衣服有男的，也有女的；绝大部分是朝鲜平民的衣服，间或有些破旧的西服。由此我们知道：被害者的绝大部分是工人、农民和城市贫民。一位还留在那里的狱卒告诉我们，被害者没吃没穿，受冻挨饿，还要受惨无人道的酷刑。监狱里惨叫声震天，每天被打死的不下七八十人。我们没有发现尸体。尸体已被匪徒们扔到汉江里去了。
    美帝国主义想尽一切办法来制造饥饿和死亡。汉城第一次解放时，人民政府曾发行了一千元的货币。匪徒们进城后，搜买了所有的物资，接着宣布：谁有一千元的钞票就要杀头！人们把钞票烧掉了。匪徒又命令人民把剩下的钞票（连他们以前自己发行的伪钞在内）存入银行，以便用人民的血汗去做买卖。匪徒们唯恐人民饿不死，除了电车、铁路、被服等对他们有用的工厂以外，其余工厂都封闭了，机关封闭了，学校也封闭了。工人失了业，职员也失业了，学生失了学。成千成万被捕杀者的财产被没收了，妻儿被逐出自己的家庭，无依无靠，受冻挨饿。儿童变成了乞丐；妇女被迫去卖淫。李承晚不但出卖了南朝鲜的美好山河，而且出卖了朝鲜妇女的贞操，去讨好美国侵略军。在城北里，在恩镇里，他们一次就逮捕三百个妇女交给侵略军。
    美帝国主义破坏文化，到了登峰造极的程度。一九三七年希特勒到慕尼黑参观“德国绘画展览会”时，亲手撕毁了他不喜欢的名画。他却赶不上美国侵略军。美国人毁坏了汉城的科学馆，把博物馆变成酒吧间和妓院。这真是对人类文化最大的污辱。
            三、汉城是不屈服的
    汉城是个不屈服的城市。美李匪帮虽然占领了她，但不能污辱她的灵魂。与美帝国主义的暴行同时存在的，是人民不屈的斗争。
    在城北桂洞的一间屋子里，我们看到了两位穿着朝鲜民族服装的年青姑娘。一个叫做边宙铉，二十二岁；一个叫做薛贞媛，二十岁。她们是千百个团结在劳动党周围和敌人艰苦斗争的战士之中的两个。她们都有自己的理想。宙铉在看护学校读了二年书，准备将来做一个人民的看护。贞媛正在念中学，计划将来入大学深造。可是，美帝国主义粉碎了她们的理想。学校被封闭了，家里穷得没有饭吃。她们在一家洗染场里找到了工作。在那里，她们参加了劳动党领导的地下斗争的组织。她们利用各种机会向人民宣传人民军必胜的形势，揭露敌人对人民军和中国人民志愿军的诬蔑宣传，动员人民帮助游击队。虽然有许多同志在工作中牺牲了，但她们并不畏惧，一直斗争到解放。
    敌人的残暴激起了人民的义愤。敌人的报纸常常登载着这一类的新闻：一位青年被捕杀，因为他想狙击国会副议长藏泽乡；一个青年被枪决，因为他狙击国防次官；美下里警察所被袭击，××地方的电线被破坏，等等。敌人想用枪杀来吓唬人民，但为自由而斗争的人是不怕死的。当着人民听到中国人民志愿军出现在朝鲜战场上，并把敌人打得节节溃逃的消息，斗争意志和胜利信心更增加了。汉城市劳动党的赵南瑨同志告诉我们，汉城解放前的十余日，成群的妇女背着粮食、衣服、袜子，在夜里偷偷地爬过北岳山，送到游击队里去。许多人在途中被敌人的“山林监视队”打死，但人们仍冒着生命的危险继续前进。一直斗争到胜利。
            四、今日汉城
    朝鲜人民军第一次解放汉城时，曾奉命不得使用重炮，为的是保护这个可爱的城市。我国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军这次解放汉城时，采取急打猛追的战法，也为的是不让敌人站稳脚跟，保护这个可爱的城市。但是，汉城已经残破了，美国人抢走汉城一切有用的东西，一个人民军军官对我们说：“他们连尘土都给扫走了。”美国人同时强迫所有居民南退，声言“不走的都是赤匪，格杀勿论”。
    汉城刚一解放，没有人，没有物资，恢复工作是极困难的。
    但是，不管有什么困难，汉城仍然是不屈服的。
    我们看见，妇女儿童在碎瓦颓垣中搜集残存的粮食和衣物，用木板在断墙边架起遮蔽风雪的小屋。我们看见，居民们把“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁”、“中华人民共和国万岁”的标语，盖在敌人贴的“欢迎联合国军”的宣传品上。我们看见，成群的避难者赶回自己的首都，不顾敌机的扫射和轰炸。我们看见，对开的《解放日报》出版了，十个工人负责这张报纸的全部排印工作。我们看见，半饥饿状态的工人看守着幸存的机器，有些工厂只剩下一两个人，却要担任防奸、防火、防盗等繁重任务。
    我们访问劳动党汉城市的某负责人，他说：恢复工作正在逐步进行中。区街政府和党的组织，大部分已经恢复起来。政府正全力解决部队、机关与居民的粮食问题，同时大力整理国家财产，保护私人财产。政府工作人员甚至替躲难未回者钉上门窗。汉城已经成立了三个孤儿院，收容、抚养被难烈士的遗孤。他说：政府正在大力招集工人，筹备恢复电灯、自来水和电车。其他工业也将尽速恢复。
    汉城的灾难还未完结，但已接近完结了。汉城有自己光荣的过去，也有光明的未来。汉城人充满信心地说：“未来是属于我们的。”
                                               一月二十日
