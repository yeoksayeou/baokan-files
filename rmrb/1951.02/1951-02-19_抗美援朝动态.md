　　Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Dynamics
　　　　Patriotic Movement of Students in the Southwest Region
    Students in various parts of Southwest China have generally improved their political awareness during participation in the national defense construction movement, and are now brewing to universally establish patriotic covenants.
    As of the end of last December, the total number of young students in Southwest China who signed up to participate in military cadre schools reached 45,000, including 15,000 in Chongqing, 12,000 in Chengdu, and 6,000 in Kunming, each accounting for more than half of the total number of middle school and university students. This movement ended in January. During this movement, students held meetings to denounce the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism, greatly enhancing their anti-American and patriotic enthusiasm and awareness. In some schools in Chongqing, 80 percent of the students requested to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    During the denunciation meetings, students from Chongqing's Qiujing and Mingcheng schools alone exposed more than 30 cases of rape and murder by the U.S. military. Some Chinese women were abducted by the U.S. military, raped, and left to die in sewers. A female student named Yu Shuhua from Nankai Middle School, who was only twelve years old in 1947 when she studied at a primary school in her hometown of Qionglai, was raped by the U.S. military. Most of the female students in that primary school were brutally raped by the U.S. military, and one of them was buried alive after becoming pregnant. When students in various schools heard these reports at the denunciation meetings, they were extremely grieved and indignant, often crying throughout the entire meeting, and determined to avenge their persecuted compatriots. During the meetings, many students denounced the cultural aggression of the United States. As a result of the dumping of pornographic American movies and photographs in cities in Southwest China, many students were poisoned, and American robbers and hooligans became objects of worship. A male student from Chongqing Middle School, influenced by American pornographic movies, even attempted to rape his own sister and mother. He painfully said at the denunciation meeting: "If the Communist Party had not come, I would have been educated into a beast by American imperialism." Many students reflected that, because they were influenced by American propaganda, some of them had even "hoped that an American would come to be the mayor of Chongqing," some had "hated being born in China," and some had even absurdly thought that as long as they could go to the United States, "even scrubbing floors would be fine," "even being a maid would be fine." Some had hoped that their parents would die early so that they could be taken in by American missionaries as "sons." Students with these erroneous ideas made self-criticisms, and this universally established in all students a psychology of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism, and enhanced their national self-esteem and self-confidence.
    After the end of the movement for students from major universities and middle schools in Southwest China to sign up for military cadre schools, they are now preparing to universally establish patriotic covenants to consolidate the achievements of the patriotic movement, continue to deepen their study of political current events, and those students who have signed up but have not been accepted are focusing on their studies, preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to serve the motherland.
　　　　Continued Report on the Patriotic Movement in the Central South Region
    As of now, the situation of the anti-American and patriotic movement in the Central South Region is as follows: it is better developed in large cities, not good enough in small and medium-sized cities, and some areas undergoing land reform have launched some activities in conjunction with land reform. In large cities, taking Wuhan as an example, this movement is better developed in schools and worse in factories, with female and elderly workers being worse than male and young workers. Of the city's more than 150 factories and enterprises, only 40 have launched current affairs propaganda and patriotic competitions. Some factory leaders regard "red flag competitions" and "patriotic competitions" as two separate things. The city is now using the student holidays to go deep into factories and neighborhoods to carry out current affairs propaganda. Hubei Province is preparing to launch anti-American and patriotic propaganda among 10 million people.
    In Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and some small cities, the patriotic movement in church schools is developing. Among the 18 university, college, and middle school church schools in Wuhan, except for Fahan Middle School, 17 schools have launched the "anti-insult and anti-slander" movement, which has awakened the students' patriotism and enhanced their national self-esteem and self-confidence. Some students have tearfully criticized their slavish thinking, such as wanting to "marry an American wife," "marry an American," and "America is better than China," and so on. Certain reactionary elements in the Catholic Church, such as Liu Hede, the vice-bishop of the Hubei Diocese and the principal of Shangzhi Middle School, put forward the so-called "from the Apostles" slogan, publicly advocating that it is necessary to maintain contact with the Vatican Curia, which interferes in China's internal affairs and opposes the Chinese people, in order to undermine the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation reform movement of patriotic Catholics. His counter-revolutionary and anti-motherland behavior has been criticized and despised by the vast number of students, teachers, and Catholics of Shangzhi Middle School.
　　　　The Patriotic Movement of Workers and Peasants in East China Still Needs to Be Continued
    Although the anti-American and patriotic movement in East China has made great progress, this movement still needs to be continued among workers and peasants.
    In the past three months, this movement has greatly promoted various practical tasks. Past experience has also proved that the patriotic movement can also be launched in rural areas, and in land reform areas, wherever it is combined with the anti-American and aid Korea movement, the masses are easily and fully mobilized, the land reform is thorough, and the peasants actively participate in the militia and local armed forces. However, in most rural areas, this movement has not yet been fully launched.
    The patriotic production competition of workers in East China's cities is expanding, but it has not yet become widespread. Only 74 factories and enterprises in Shanghai have launched production competitions, and only 20-odd enterprises in Hangzhou have launched production competitions to varying degrees. All those who have launched competitions have gained a lot, mainly improving product quality, improving production tools, saving raw materials, strengthening the unity of workers and staff, improving labor-management relations, and improving production management.

　　抗美援朝动态
            西南区学生的爱国运动
    西南各地学生在参加国防建设运动中政治觉悟普遍提高，现在酝酿普遍订立爱国公约。
    截至去年十二月底止，西南各地报名参加军干校的青年学生总数达四万五千人，其中重庆市一万五千，成都一万二千，昆明六千，各占大中学生总数二分之一强。这一运动至一月间已结束。学生们在这一运动中纷纷集会控诉美帝国主义侵略暴行，抗美爱国的热情和认识大大提高。重庆有的学校有百分之八十的学生要求加入中国新民主主义青年团。
    在控诉集会中，仅重庆求精、明诚两校学生即揭露了美军强奸杀人暴行三十多件，有的中国妇女被美军捉去强奸致病后，被丢在阴沟里。南开中学一女生于蜀华一九四七年在故乡邛崃一小学校念书时年仅十二岁，即被美军强奸，那间小学的大部分女生都曾惨遭美军强奸，其中一人被强奸怀孕后又被活埋了。各校学生在控诉集会上听到这些报告时悲愤异常，常常全场痛哭，并决心为被迫害的同胞报仇。在集会中，许多学生控诉了美国的文化侵略。美国诲盗诲淫的电影、照片在西南各城市倾销的结果，不少学生受到毒害，美国的强盗和流氓成了崇拜的对象。重庆市中一男生受了美国色情电影的影响，竟图强奸自己的妹妹和妈妈。他在控诉会上痛苦地说：“要不是共产党来了，我定会被美帝教育成禽兽的。”许多学生反省出，因为受了美国宣传的影响，他们中有的竟曾“希望有个美国人来当重庆市长”，有的曾经“恨自己出生在中国”，有的甚至荒谬地想过，只要能到美国去，“擦地板也好”，“当丫头也好”，有的曾希望自己父母早死，好被美国传教士收留做个“儿子”。有这些错误想法的学生都作了自我批判，并使全体学生对美国帝国主义的仇视、鄙视和蔑视的心理普遍建立起来，并提高了自己的民族自尊心和自信心。
    西南各大中学校学生在报名参加军干校的运动结束后，现正准备普遍订立爱国公约，巩固爱国运动成果，并继续深入政治时事学习，报名而未被录取的学生则安心学习，准备随时响应祖国号召，为祖国服务。
            中南区爱国运动续讯
    截至目前，中南区抗美爱国运动的情况是：大城市开展得较好，中小城市不够好，一部分土地改革地区结合土地改革展开了一些。在大城市中，以武汉为例，这一运动在学校开展较好，工厂较差，其中女工和老年工又比男工和青工为差。该市一百五十多工厂企业，仅四十个展开了时事宣传和爱国竞赛。有些工厂的负责人把“红旗竞赛”和“爱国主义竞赛”当作两回事。该市现正利用学生假期深入工厂、街坊展开时事宣传。湖北省已准备在一千万人口中展开抗美爱国宣传。
    武汉、广州、长沙、南昌及部分小城市的教会学校，爱国运动正在发展中。武汉市十八个大学、专科和中学教会学校中，除法汉中学外，十七个学校都已展开“反污辱、反诽谤”运动，使学生的爱国心开始觉醒，民族自尊心和自信心提高。有些学生痛哭流涕地批判了自己的奴化思想，例如曾经想定要“娶个美国老婆”，“嫁个美国人”，“美国就比中国好”等等。若干天主教会中的反动分子，例如湖北教区副主教、上智中学校长刘和德，提出所谓“自宗徒”口号，公开宣传必须与干涉中国内政反对中国人民的梵蒂冈教廷联系，以破坏天主教爱国教徒的自治自养自传革新运动，他的这种反革命反祖国行为，已受到上智中学广大学生、教员和天主教徒们的斥责和鄙弃。
            华东区工农群众爱国运动还须继续展开
    华东区的抗美爱国运动虽已有很大发展，但在工农群众中这一运动还须继续展开。
    这一运动在过去三个月中，对于各项实际工作起了很大的推动作用。过去经验也证明，爱国运动在农村也可以展开，而且土地改革区凡与抗美援朝运动相结合的，群众即容易充分发动起来，土地改革也彻底，农民并纷纷自动参加民兵和地方武装。但大部分农村，这一运动还没有充分展开。
    华东各城市工人的爱国主义生产竞赛正在扩大，但还未普遍发展。上海仅有七十四个工厂企业展开了生产竞赛，杭州也只有二十几个企业单位展开程度不等的生产竞赛。凡是展开了竞赛的，都有很大收获，主要是提高了产品质量，改善了生产工具，节约了原料，加强了工人和职员的团结，改善了劳资关系，改善了生产管理。
