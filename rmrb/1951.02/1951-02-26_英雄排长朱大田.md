　　Hero Platoon Leader Zhu Datian
　　Chang Gong
    Zhu Datian is a platoon leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a combat hero. On November 15th last year, his unit was ordered to transfer positions from a certain place, and the platoon led by Zhu Datian was assigned the task of providing cover.

    Before dawn, Zhu Datian led his platoon into the position. This position included five hilltops, the most exposed location for the entire regiment, not only far from the main force of the battalion and regiment, but also surrounded on three sides by a battalion of enemy soldiers. In order to complete this arduous covering task, Zhu Datian mobilized all the soldiers in the platoon, quickly arranged the positions, strengthened fortifications, and prepared for close combat.

    At three o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy began to attack. A company of enemy soldiers attacked from the front. Shell fragments mixed with bullets flew straight along the ground. The soldiers calmly gripped their weapons, monitoring the enemy. When the enemy advanced within twenty meters, Zhu Datian ordered them to open fire. A rain of bullets poured down from the mountain, and more than a dozen enemies, who were shouting and yelling, immediately fell. The remaining enemies tucked their tails between their legs and fled, crawling and running.

    At this time, in order to facilitate the transfer, the battalion ordered them to withdraw the heavy machine guns and 60 mortars that had been assigned to them in advance. Although reducing firepower would increase the difficulty of their defense, Zhu Datian resolutely carried out the order, and then rearranged the positions, adjusted the troop strength, and prepared to repel the enemy's continued attack.

    Soon, the enemy attacked the mountain again with two companies, under the cover of countless light and heavy weapons, in three routes. As in the first time, Zhu Datian waited until the enemy was about twenty meters away before ordering them to open fire, immediately knocking down more than twenty more enemies, and the remaining enemies fled again, crawling and running.

    Finally, the enemy fiercely fired at them with countless light and heavy machine guns from the front right, attempting to attract their attention, while a company maneuvered from the rear left, attempting to cut off their retreat and completely annihilate them. After Zhu Datian discovered this enemy conspiracy, he retreated the entire platoon one step, leaving only a group in front to monitor the enemy on the right front, while contacting the battalion headquarters, asking the battalion to send a part of the troops to flank the enemy maneuvering to the rear left with them. As a result, this enemy attack was again crushed.

    Zhu Datian and his platoon defended for a day, repelling three enemy attacks, completing the covering task, killing and wounding more than fifty enemies, while Zhu Datian's entire platoon suffered no casualties.

    Zhu Datian and all the soldiers of his platoon were therefore commended by a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　英雄排长朱大田

    朱大田是中国人民志愿军某部的一个排长，是个战斗英雄。去年十一月十五日，该部奉命由某地转移阵地，朱大田所指挥的排担任了掩护的任务。
    拂晓以前，朱大田带着他的排进入阵地。这阵地包括五个山头，是全团最突出的地方，不仅与营团主力相距很远，并且在一营敌人的三面包围之中。为了完成这个艰巨的掩护任务，朱大田对全排战士进行了动员，并且迅速布置好阵地，加强工事，做好了近战的准备。
    下午三点钟，敌人开始进攻。一个连的敌人从正面往上攻。炮弹片夹着枪弹紧贴地面直飞。战士们镇静地紧握着武器，监视着敌人。等到敌人进到二十公尺以内，朱大田下令开火。枪弹暴雨似的从山上倾泻下去，正在大喊大叫的敌人，一下子就倒下了十几个。剩下的敌人就都夹起尾巴连爬带跑的逃掉了。
    这时候，营里为了转移方便，命令他们把配属给他们的重机枪和六○炮提先撤出。虽然减少了火器会增加他们守备的困难，但是朱大田坚决执行了命令，随即重新布置阵地，调整兵力，准备迎击敌人的继续进攻。
    不久，敌人又以两个连兵力，在无数轻重火器掩护下，分三路向山上进攻。和第一次一样，朱大田一直等敌人进到二十公尺左右，才下令开火，一下子就又打倒了二十多个敌人，其余的敌人又连爬带跑的逃走了。
    最后敌人一面以无数轻重机枪从右前方向他们猛烈射击，企图吸引他们的注意力，一面以一个连从左后方迂回过来，企图切断他们后路，将他们完全歼灭。朱大田发觉敌人这一阴谋以后，就把全排后撤一步，只留下一个小组在前面监视右前方的敌人，同时和营部联络，请营里派一部分部队来，和他们一道夹击迂回左后方的敌人。结果敌人这次进攻又被粉碎了。
    朱大田和他的排守备了一天，打退敌人三次进攻，完成了掩护任务，毙伤敌人五十多名，而朱大田全排没有一个伤亡。
    朱大田和他全排的战士因此受到了志愿军某部的表扬。  （新华社）
