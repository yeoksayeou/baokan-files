Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - The Red Cross Society of China has issued a statement to the Red Cross Societies of all countries, opposing the US rearmament of Japan. The statement says:

The Chinese people have fresh memories of the crimes of the Japanese aggressors, and the US imperialist scheme to rearm Japan cannot but arouse our boundless anger. The crimes of the Japanese fascist bandits are beyond description. To speak only of the crimes directly harming the Chinese Red Cross Society, they betrayed the international Red Cross conventions they had signed, inhumanely bombing Chinese civilians, using poison gas and bacteria, bombing hospitals and ambulances, and capturing and killing medical personnel. According to incomplete statistics from the Chinese Red Cross Society, between 1937 and 1945, the Japanese fascist bandits bombed 17 of our hospitals and ambulance team headquarters marked with clear Red Cross symbols, and destroyed 20 of our ambulances marked with Red Cross symbols on their roofs. Some ambulances were subjected to low-altitude bombing by Japanese aircraft. One hundred and fourteen Red Cross medical personnel were killed by Japanese aircraft while providing aid in civilian residential areas. Dr. Su Keji and ten other Red Cross doctors and nurses were captured and killed by Japanese troops in Luodian, Shanghai, Mianchi, Henan, Yuanqu, Shanxi, and Dushan, Guizhou. At the time, these medical personnel had clear Red Cross symbols and credentials for their work assignments.

In its work, the Chinese Red Cross Society confirmed that in 1940, Japanese troops spread plague bacillus in Qu County and Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, and in 1941 in Changde, Hunan Province, causing severe plague epidemics in these areas.

The crimes of the Japanese fascist bandits are an unprecedented persecution and humiliation for the world's Red Cross. Red Cross workers from 68 countries around the world! Can we allow US imperialism to re-establish Japanese fascist forces to harm Red Cross workers again and slaughter the vast peaceful people of the world? No, this is clearly against our wishes and against the fundamental spirit of the Red Cross. In order to safeguard human peace and security, and to realize the solemn resolution of the World Red Cross to strive for peace, the Red Cross Society of China calls on the Red Cross Societies of all countries and their members to pay attention to the seriousness of this US imperialist plot to undermine peace, to jointly oppose the US imperialist unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the sinister plan to rearm Japan as a tool of aggression, and to actively strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, to end the US's separate control of Japan, and to eliminate the hotbed of aggressive war in the East.

　　我国红十字会发表声明
    反对美国重新武装日本
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国红十字会向世界各国红十字会发出反对美国重新武装日本的声明。声明称：
    中国人民对日本侵略者的罪行，记忆犹新，美帝国主义重新武装日本的这一阴谋不能不激起我们的无边愤怒。日本法西斯强盗们的罪状是无法罄述的。单就直接损害中国红十字会的罪行来说，他们背叛了自己所签订的国际红十字公约，毫无人性地滥炸中国平民，使用毒气和细菌，轰炸医院和救护车，俘杀医护人员。根据中国红十字会不完全资料统计，日本法西斯强盗们在一九三七至一九四五年之间，炸毁了标有显明红十字符号的本会医院、救护部队队部十七处，炸毁了顶面标有红十字符号的本会救护车二十辆，有些救护车辆遭到日机的低飞轰炸。一百十四个红十字会医护人员在平民居住区进行救护时被日机炸死。苏克己医师等十一位红十字会医师、护士，先后在上海罗店、河南渑池、山西垣曲和贵州独山等地被日寇俘杀。当时这些医护人员都有显明的红十字符号和工作任务的凭证。
    中国红十字会在工作中证实了一九四○年日寇在浙江衢县、金华和一九四一年在湖南常德等地散布了鼠疫杆菌，使各该地区流行严重的鼠疫症。
    日本法西斯强盗的这种罪行是对世界红十字会空前未有的迫害与屈辱。全世界六十八个国家的红十字会工作者们！我们能让美帝国主义重新扶植日本法西斯势力，再度来残害红十字会工作者和屠杀世界广大的和平人们吗？不，这显然是违反我们的意愿，违反红十字会的基本精神的。为了维护人类的和平与安全，为了实现世界红十字会争取和平的庄严决议，中国红十字会吁请各国红十字会及其会员注意美帝国主义这一破坏和平的阴谋的严重性，共同起来反对美帝国主义片面对日媾和以及重新武装日本作为侵略工具的阴险计划，并积极为争取对日缔结全面和约，结束美国单独对日管制状态，消除东方的侵略战争的温床而努力。
