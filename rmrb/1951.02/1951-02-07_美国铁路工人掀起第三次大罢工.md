Xinhua News Agency, February 5th:

　　Since August of last year, when the US railroads were placed under military control, a third major strike has erupted on January 30th, since Truman issued the takeover order. Disregarding the opposition of right-wing union leaders and the warnings of the court, the workers spontaneously went on strike, demanding approval of their reasonable demands, put forward more than a year ago, to improve working conditions, shorten working hours without reducing wages.
    The strike began in Chicago and Detroit, the largest railway centers in the United States, and spread to eight major cities in less than twenty-four hours. As of the 1st, the strike had affected at least forty-four cities. This strike was mainly led by 5,000 switchmen of the Railroad Employees Brotherhood, and was joined by train attendants, drivers, and ticket inspectors from various railway lines. The strike has paralyzed passenger and freight transport on many railways, causing many factories to shut down or reduce production. US government officials also admitted that the strike has severely hampered the US government's transport activities for its aggressive war, and large quantities of military supplies, ready to be shipped abroad, have been piled up on station platforms and cannot be transported.

　　美国铁路工人掀起第三次大罢工
    【新华社五日讯】自去年八月起即在军队管制下的美国铁路，于一月三十日起又爆发了自杜鲁门发布接管令以来的第三次大罢工。工人们不顾右翼工会领袖的反对和法院的警告，自动举行罢工，要求批准他们提出已经一年多的改进劳动条件的合理要求，缩短工作时间但不减少工资。
    罢工开始于美国最大铁路中心芝加哥和底特律，不到二十四小时就扩大到八个主要城市。到一日为止，罢工已波及至少四十四个城市。这次罢工以铁路员工兄弟会的五千名转辙工人为主，并有各铁路线的车务员、司机和查票员参加。罢工瘫痪了许多铁道的客货车运，使得许多工厂已停工或减少生产。美国政府官员并承认，罢工已严重打击了美国政府进行侵略战争的运输活动，准备运往国外的军事物资，已大量堆积在车站月台上无法运出。
