　　Jiangxi Yuanzhou Special District Land Reform Completed
    Farmers Actively Prepare for Spring Plowing
    [This newspaper reports] Farmers in various parts of the Yuanzhou Special District, Jiangxi Province, are enthusiastically carrying out preparations for spring plowing and production. After the movements of rent reduction, debt abolition, debt refund, and anti-hegemony, and the first phase of land reform in Yichun (i.e., Yuanzhou), Wanzai, Pingxiang, Yifeng, Fenyi, Xinyu, Tonggu, and Shanggao counties under the special district's jurisdiction, the farmers' production enthusiasm has greatly increased. They are investing the means of production they have obtained into the preparations for spring plowing and production. For example, in Xinyu County, more than 2,900 households obtained more than 755,000 catties of grain during the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement. They used this grain to repair 183 ponds and 109 dikes, mobilizing a total of 221,500 workers (including women). Land ploughed in the winter accounted for 80 percent of the county's 560,000 mu of fields. In areas where land reform has been completed, farmers have been allocated land, and their production enthusiasm is even higher. They are stepping up efforts to build water conservancy projects, add farm tools, and buy cattle. For example, in Nankeng Township, Pingxiang County, inspired by the victory of land reform, the masses in three natural villages opened three new ponds, which can irrigate more than 800 mu of fields. In Liangyan Township, Anji District, farmers bought 14 head of cattle with the grain they were allocated, solving the farming difficulties of poor and hired farmers who lacked cattle power. Yiyuan Township is showing a new atmosphere. In addition to the increase of 14 cattle in the township, 30 plows, 24 harrows, 230 hoes, 110 carrying baskets, and 180 sun-drying mats were newly purchased. Poor peasant Huang Peijun said with a smile, "Our families also bought 100 catties of iron and 300 catties of iron charcoal, but we just can't find a blacksmith!" (There is only one blacksmith shop in their township). In addition, every household is busy accumulating fertilizer. Now, in the countryside, as an old man said, "There are more people picking manure than people passing by." San Village, Wanyan Township, Wanzai County, dug eleven new manure cellars. Zhang Yezhi, a poor peasant, alone accumulated more than 20 loads of fertilizer. Farmers in Chengtang Township, Yifeng County, dug pond mud as fertilizer, and ten loads of pond mud can fertilize one mu of field. Currently, Village 1 of the township has accumulated more than 3,000 loads.
    Last year's crops in Pingxiang, Yichun, Wanzai, Yifeng, Tonggu and other counties suffered from insect pests, which affected a part of the harvest. This year, in order to prevent insect pests, preparations for pest control have been actively carried out. Among the masses, a movement to dig up rice roots and eliminate insects has been widely launched. Some townships have put forward the slogan "Dig up one more rice root, harvest one more handful of grain." During the movement, some people did not have enough understanding of pest control and did not believe that insects would hibernate under the rice roots. After detailed explanations from labor models and working cadres, and after catching insects under the rice roots for everyone to see, the masses received practical education and came forward to turn over the fields and dig up the rice roots. In some areas, because the land reform policy was not publicized enough, the masses were not enthusiastic enough about spring plowing production preparations. However, the awareness of the majority of the masses has been raised, and they have learned from experience and lessons. The insect elimination movement has also been widely carried out. Women have also actively participated in the movement. Farmers in Zhaoxi Township, Wanzai County, Xintang Township, Yichun County, and Paibu Township, Tonggu County, have organized mutual aid teams of 30 to more than 100 people to dig up rice roots.

　　江西袁州专区土改完成
    农民积极准备春耕
    【本报讯】江西省袁州专区各地农民正热烈进行春耕生产准备工作。该专区所属宜春（即袁州）、万载、萍乡、宜丰、分宜、新喻、铜鼓、上高八县在经过减租、废债、退债、反霸等运动及第一期土地改革以后，农民的生产情绪大为提高。他们将所获得的生产资料，投入了春耕生产的准备工作。如新喻县在减租反霸运动中，有二千九百余户获得了七十五万五千余斤粮食。他们用这些粮食修好了水塘一百八十三口，水陂一百零九条，共动员了民工二十二万一千五百人（妇女在内）。经过冬耕的土地占全县五十六万亩田的百分之八十。土地改革完毕的地区，农民分得了土地，生产情绪更高。他们正在加紧兴修水利，添置农具，购买耕牛。如萍乡县南坑乡有三个自然村的群众，就在土地改革胜利鼓舞之下，新开了三口水塘，可灌溉八百多亩田。在安汲区两严乡，农民们将分得的粮食买了十四头耕牛，解决了缺乏牛力的贫雇农的耕作困难。沂源乡更是呈现出一片新的气象。该乡除耕牛增加了十四头以外，新买了犁三十张，耙二十四张，锄头二百三十张，箩一百一十担，晒垫一百八十床。贫农黄培均笑容满面地说：“我们几家还买了一百斤铁，三百斤铁炭，只是请不到铁匠呢！”（在他们乡里只有一家铁匠店）此外，家家正忙着积肥。现在，农村中的早晨，正如一位老公公说的：“捡粪的人比往来的人多了。”万载县万岩乡三村就挖了十一个新粪窖。仅贫农张业志一家就积了二十多担肥。宜丰县澄塘乡的农民挖地塘泥当肥料，十担塘泥可肥一亩田，现该乡一村已积了三千多担。
    在萍乡、宜春、万载、宜丰、铜鼓等县，去年的庄稼遭受了虫害，影响了一部分收成。今年为了防止虫害，已积极作好除虫的准备工作。在群众中，普遍发起了挖禾兜除虫运动。有的乡提出“多挖一禾兜，多收一把谷”的口号。在运动中，有的群众对除虫认识不足，不相信虫会冬眠在禾兜下，经过劳动模范及工作干部的详细解释，并在禾兜下捉出虫子来给大家看，群众受到了实际的教育，才纷纷起来翻田挖禾兜。有些地区，因对土地改革政策宣传得不够，致群众对春耕生产准备工作还不够起劲。但大多数群众觉悟已经提高，加上在事实上接受了经验教训，除虫运动也已普遍开展。妇女群众也积极地参加了运动。万载沼西乡、宜春新塘乡，铜鼓排埠乡等地农民并组织了三十多到一百余人的互助组来挖禾兜。
