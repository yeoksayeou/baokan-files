　　Wind and Snow in Gyeonggi Province
    Special Correspondent for this newspaper: Yang Shuo
            I. Advancing Towards Victory
    After the new year (Gregorian calendar), the climate in Korea changed. The mountains and fields were covered in a vast expanse of white after days and nights of wind and snow, with snow reaching above the knees in deep areas. At dusk, our Volunteer Army soldiers would look at the heavy snow and say, "It's good weather again!"
    On nights like these, there's less harassment from enemy planes, and the roads to Seoul are unusually bustling. On the main roads and small paths, Korean oxcarts creak and rumble, four-horse-drawn carriages from the Northeast rumble past, and the trucks, many of which are painted with white five-pointed stars (obviously newly captured), rumble even louder.
    The moon, around the eighth or ninth day of the lunar month, though obscured by clouds and snow, illuminated the night sky with a clarity like dawn. You could see a vague silhouette of people, noisy from afar. From the intonation, you could tell it was Chinese, and guess that it was a stretcher team composed of volunteers from the Northeast farmers. They were all wearing their cotton coats inside out, some with ice and snow clinging to their beards, lamenting the destroyed homes of Korean farmers.
    The ranks of the fighting Volunteer Army surged forward. It is countless people like this, sleeping in earthen caves, eating fried noodles, braving the freezing weather, each draped in a white cloth sheet, who have driven the American invaders head over heels, retreating in disarray, from the Chinese border. Advance towards Daegu! Advance towards Daejeon! This is their slogan for the advance. I met a artillery unit of the Volunteer Army who said amusingly: "Since crossing the river (Yalu River), we haven't participated in a single battle. We keep rushing forward, but we can't catch up with the front." A Korean People's Army soldier also said, "The Chinese Volunteer Army can travel over a hundred li in one go; they are practically machines!" The speed of our soldiers' actions has, in fact, defeated the machines that the Americans rely on.
    Strange teams appeared in the flow of people, each person dragging a rake plow behind them, with tall things tied on top. The soldiers are very innocent, and never forget to make jokes: "Comrades, where did you get this mule team from?" One of those pulling the rake plow laughed and said, "Don't be funny! We pulled this all the way from the Northeast, over a thousand li, just to give you comfort!"
    The mountains are high and the snow is thick, and a truck slid into a snow ditch by the side of the road, unable to climb out. A Korean People's Army gun truck came from behind and immediately stopped. The artillerymen jumped out of the truck, rushed to the truck, and, with a few "heave-hos," pushed the truck out. Without saying much, they quickly drove away.
    The People's Army on patrol along the road fired a shot—enemy planes are here! The enemy planes flew as low as the mountaintops, their wings stirring up the snow on the ground, and swooshing it onto people's faces. A gasoline drum on a truck was hit, and it caught fire. The driver, a Party member, didn't care about saving the truck, jumped up, and tried to roll the gasoline drum into the snow. However, the gasoline drum had been hit with many holes, and the oil leaked out, and the entire truck caught fire in the blink of an eye. The Party member's cotton coat was also burning, his whole body was on fire, his hands were swollen from the burns, and seeing no other way, he rolled into the snow to extinguish the fire on his body. Once the planes left, the vehicles moved again like flowing water. These countless people and vehicles came from different directions, surging towards one direction—south, south, towards Seoul, towards even greater victory.
            II. The People Who Regained Freedom
    During the day, you can occasionally see scattered Korean people on the road, carrying some tattered things on their backs and heads, returning to their own homes. Homes that no longer resemble homes! The thatched houses where their ancestors had lived for generations were broken and destroyed by bombing; the crops that they had painstakingly cultivated all year round were barren and burned! But what they gained was freedom. For nearly forty years, this nation lived a miserable life of slavery, and the days of the past could no longer be repeated. For freedom, a painful mother sent her child, whom she had raised with her own hands, to the front lines; for freedom, they can endure the enormous disaster before them!
    We settled in a ri (village), and the chairman of the ri People's Committee, called Xuan Biankui, always had a gloomy face, with a look of fanatic enthusiasm in his eyes. He was very serious about his work, vying to do this and that for the Volunteer Army. The translator told me, "You don't know, he is a Labor Party member, and originally had a mother, wife, and two children. Before the American troops came, he withdrew with the People's Army to the north. This time, he fought back with the Chinese Volunteer Army. When he got home, he saw that his entire family of four had been killed by the enemy! The two children were put into straw sacks and buried alive! When he heard this, he fainted for a long time. After waking up, he didn't shed a single tear, and went to work at the People's Committee, never knowing fatigue!"
    I also met an old farmer named Jin Daxian, with a face like stone. He borrowed my pen and wrote on the paper: "I [had] sixty bags of rice a year," then made a gesture of striking a match, and raised his hands up, saying, "Whoosh! All burned by the American troops!" He buried his face in his right arm, and then raised it again, saying, "I cried!" After a while, he wrote again: "Next spring, go to China! Korea……" He pointed to his mouth, and then waved his hand. How he longs for the happy life that the Chinese farmers have already earned!
    But the Korean people cannot be crushed. Passing through Xinxi, I stayed at the home of Jiang Changlian, the secretary of the Labor Party cell, and squeezed together with his family. Early in the morning, many people came to the house, and everyone gathered around the small kang table, writing and calculating. Upon inquiry, it turned out that they were raising public grain for the People's Army. Jiang Changlian is a taciturn person. He told me: There used to be a state-run livestock farm in Xinxi, covering an area of forty li, raising cattle, sheep, pigs, etc., and also tractors. When the American troops came, the livestock were slaughtered and eaten, the tractors were smashed, and before they fled, they even used artillery to flatten the houses. These beasts just don't want humans to have a prosperous life. It doesn't matter, Jiang Changlian said well: "If they destroy one of ours, we will build three identical livestock farms." These Labor Party members will be able to lead the people to restore their destroyed homes and rebuild their motherland. The wind and snow are heavy, but spring is coming soon. Now they are considering the problem of planting rice in the spring.
            III. Salute, Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Every Korean will not forget the righteous assistance of the Chinese Volunteer Army. They don't understand Chinese, and are accustomed to expressing their feelings to you in various ways.
    Several times while camping, someone would come up to me, point to themselves and say, "My, Labor Party!" indicating that we were class brothers. Or they would offer you their hard work. Not knowing how to say "hard work," they learned the two words "gòu qiàng" (tough) from someone, and everywhere you could hear them saying, "You from China, very, very gòu qiàng!" Or they would simply keep saying, "Gòu qiàng! Gòu qiàng!"
    They were even more considerate of you in their daily lives. In the middle of the night, whether it was windy or snowy, with a tap on the window, the lights in the house would be turned on, the door would be opened to let you into the house, and a warm kang would be made available for you to sleep on. When you wake up at dawn, you will often find yourself covered with a thick cotton quilt, which the hands of a Korean mother have put on you.
    Once, I fell ill while marching and brought back some coarse rice from the kitchen to cook porridge. The landlady rushed to cook it for me; even that was fine; but when she brought it up after cooking, the rice grains were white and large, and it turned out that she had secretly replaced it with good rice.
    There is also this matter. Volunteer Army soldiers had to cross a river, but there was no bridge, and they had to wade across barefoot. The river was flowing with ice, cold to the bone. An old Korean man, feeling really bad about it, quickly took off the Chinese-style jacket he was wearing and draped it over the soldier. The soldier smiled and pushed his hand away, rolled up his trousers and went into the river. The old man was stunned, holding the jacket in both hands, not moving for a long time.
    Whenever you meet a Volunteer Army soldier, and mention the old folks, he is sure to say without end: "The Korean old folks are so good." The Korean people even more so never forget the benefits of the Volunteer Army. Several times, I heard a crisp voice singing next door: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no China..." Intermittently, out of tune. Pushing open the door on the partition wall, it was all Korean children. This song, in the newly liberated areas of China, I have heard the people sing with joyful hearts more than once, but I didn't expect to hear it in Korea today.
    "Salute, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" - This is almost a slogan that can be seen everywhere.

　　风雪京畿道
    本报特约记者  杨朔
            一、向胜利挺进
    过了阳历年，朝鲜的气候变了，几天几夜飘风扬雪的山野白茫茫的一片，雪深处没到膝盖以上。一到傍晚，我们志愿军的战士望着漫天大雪却说：“又是个好天气！”
    这种夜晚，飞机骚扰少，汉城道上，真是出奇的热闹。大路小路，朝鲜的大轱轳牛车咕隆咕隆响，从东北来的四套马胶皮大车吱吱撵过去，川流不息的大卡车轰隆轰隆闹的更欢，其中许多还涂着五角白星，显然是新缴获的。
    阴历初八、九的月亮，虽说云遮雪掩，映得夜色也像拂晓一样清朗。你可以望见一支模糊的人影，老远闹嚷嚷的。从音节上也能辨出是中国话，也就可以猜出这是东北农民志愿组成的担架队。他们一色反穿着棉大衣，有的胡子上挂着冰雪，一路感叹着朝鲜农民被破坏的家园。
    战斗的志愿军行列涌上来了。就是无数这样的人，睡土洞，吃炒面，冰天雪地，每人披着张白布单，从中国边境上把美国侵略者打得一个斤头又一个斤头，屁滚尿流败退下去。向大邱前进！向大田前进！这是他们进军的口号。我见过一支志愿军的炮兵，说的很有趣：“过江（鸭绿江）以后，我们一次战斗也没参加。紧往前赶，总赶不上前方。”一位朝鲜人民军也说：“中国志愿军一走一百多里，简直是机器呀！”我们战士行动的迅速，事实上已经把美国倚仗的机器打输了。
    人流里出现了奇怪的队伍，每人背后拖着张耙犁，上边绑着很高的东西。战士们顶天真，永远不会忘记说笑话：“同志啊，你们这是那来的驮骡队！”拉耙犁的当中有人笑道：“别逗乐啦！我们从东北拉了上千里地，特意来慰劳你们的呀！”
    山高雪厚，一辆卡车滑到路边大雪坎子里，爬不出来。后面开来朝鲜人民军的炮车，立时停住闸。炮兵从车上跳下来，一齐拥到那辆卡车旁边，嗨哟几声，把车推了出来，也不多言声，急匆匆地各自又开走了。
    沿路放哨的人民军响了枪——敌机来了！敌机飞得齐小山顶高，翅膀子扇起地面的积雪，唰唰地扑到人脸上。一台卡车上的汽油桶打着了，火烧起来。司机党从可顾着救车，跳上去，想把汽油桶滚到雪地去。可是汽油桶被打了许多洞洞，油漏出来，转眼全车起了火。党从可的棉衣也烧了，浑身是火，手都烧肿了，看看没法，才滚到雪地里把身上的火滚灭。飞机一走，车马又像流水似地开动起来。这数不尽的人马车辆从不同的方向来，朝着一个方向涌去——往南，往南，向着汉城，向着更大的胜利挺进。
            二、重获自由的人民
    白天，路上偶然能见的是些零零星星的朝鲜人民，背着顶着点破烂东西，重新回到自己的家门。家那还像家！他们祖辈父辈住的稻草房子破了，炸毁了；一年到头辛辛苦苦种的庄稼荒了，烧掉了！但他们获得的却是自由。将近四十年，这个民族过着悲惨的奴隶生活，过去的日子不能再重复了。为了自由，痛苦的母亲将她一把屎一把尿养大的孩子送上前线；为了自由，他们能够忍受眼前天大的灾难！
    我们落脚到一个里（村），里人民委员会的委员长叫玄变奎，老是阴沉沉的板着个脸，眼神露出一种疯狂的热情。办事十分认真，抢着替志愿军做这个，做那个。翻译人员告诉我说：“你不知道，他是劳动党员，原本有母亲、媳妇、两个小孩。美军要来以前，他跟人民军撤到北边去，这回跟中国志愿军又打回来，到家一看，一家四口都叫敌人害死了！两个小孩叫人装到草袋子里，活活埋了！他一听昏过去半天，醒了以后，没掉一滴泪，跑到人民委员会干起工作来，永远不知道累！”
    我还遇见过一个叫金达显的年老农民，脸像石头一样，借我的笔在纸上写道：“我一年六十袋大米”，接着做了个划洋火的手势，两手向上一扬说：“忽！统统叫美军烧了！”就把脸埋到右胳膊里，又抬起来说：“我哭了！”一会又写道：“明春中国去！朝鲜………”便指指嘴，又摆摆手。他是怎样想望着中国农民已经挣得的幸福生活啊！
    但是朝鲜人民是踩不倒的。路过新溪，我宿在劳动党细胞委员长姜长连的家里，跟他一家子挤做一堆。早起，屋里来了许多人，大家围着小炕棹，又写又算。一打听，原来是替人民军筹公粮。姜长连是个沉默寡言的人。他对我说：新溪原有座国营牧畜场，方圆四十里，养着牛羊猪等等，还有拖拉机。美军一来，牲灵宰着吃了，拖拉机砸了，临逃跑还使大炮把房子轰平。这些畜牲，就是不愿意人类有着富足的生活。没关系，姜长连说得好：“他毁了我们一个，我们就要动手建设三个同样的牧畜场。”这些劳动党人是能够领导着人民恢复他们破坏的家园，重建祖国的。风雪正大，可是，春天就要来了。现在他们正考虑着春天种稻子的问题。
            三、敬礼，中国人民志愿军！
    每个朝鲜人都不会忘记中国志愿军正义的援助。他们不懂中国话，惯会用各种各样方法向你表达心意。
    好几次宿营，有人凑到我跟前，指指自己说：“我的，劳动党！”表示彼此是阶级兄弟。再不就向你道辛苦，不会说辛苦，不知从谁学到“够呛”两个字，到处听见说：“你的中国来，大大的够呛！”要不干脆连说：“够呛！够呛！”
    生活上对你更是体贴入微。深更半夜，不管是刮风下雪，一拍窗户，屋里就点起灯，推开门让你进屋，腾出热炕头给你睡。睡到天亮，你常常会发觉身上盖着厚厚的棉被，这是朝鲜母亲的手替你盖的。
    有一回，我在行军当中害病，从伙房领回点粗大米，想熬稀饭喝。房东媳妇抢着要替熬，这也罢了；赶熬好端上来一看，米粒又白又大，原来私下给换上好大米了。
    还有这样事。志愿军的战士要过河，没有桥，得脱了鞋徒涉。河里流着冰，冷的炸骨头。一个朝鲜老汉看着实在过意不去，赶紧脱下身上穿的对襟长褂子，往战士身上披。战士笑着推开他的手，挽起裤子下了河。那老汉看呆了，两手擎着褂子，半天一动也不动。
    你凡是碰见志愿军的战士，提起老乡，他准会不绝口地说：“朝鲜老乡太好啦。”朝鲜人民更是念念不忘志愿军的好处。曾经几次，我听见隔壁有脆嫩的嗓子唱着：“没有共产党就没有中国……”断断续续的，不成音调。推开板壁上的门一看，都是些朝鲜小孩。这个歌，在中国新解放区，我不止一次听见人民用欢乐的心情唱着，不想今天在朝鲜也听到了。
    “敬礼，英勇的中国人民志愿军！”——这差不多是随地可见的标语。
