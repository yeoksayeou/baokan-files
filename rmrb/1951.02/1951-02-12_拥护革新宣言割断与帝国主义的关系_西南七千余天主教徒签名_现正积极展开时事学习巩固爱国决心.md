Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th: Following the initiation of the Chinese Catholic Self-Reliance and Reform Movement by Father Wang Liangzuo and over 500 other Catholics in Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan Administrative Region, Catholics in seven dioceses, encompassing 25 cities and counties in the Southwest Region, have successively issued declarations of self-reliance and reform or signed declarations. These 25 cities and counties are Chongqing, Kunming, and Luzhou cities, and Guangyuan, Yuechi, Anyue, Dazhou, Jiangyou, Langzhong, Nanchong, Yingshan, Zhongjiang, Tongnan, Suining, Shehong, Lezhi, Pengxi, Xichong in the Northern Sichuan Region, Jiajiang in the Western Sichuan Region, Yibin in the Southern Sichuan Region, and Wanxian, Yongchuan, Guang'an, Linshui, and Jiangjin in the Eastern Sichuan Region. The number of signatories totals 7,551, including Bishop Wang Wencheng and Vicar General Zhong Bingliang of the Nanchong Diocese, Acting Bishop Shi Mingliang of the Chongqing Diocese, and 68 priests (i.e., presbyters), including Wang Liangzuo, who first initiated the Catholic reform movement. In addition, Catholics in Chengdu and Guiyang have issued declarations to resist America, aid Korea, protect the homeland, and defend peace. Catholics in Chengdu also held patriotic parades.

In their reform declarations, Catholics in the aforementioned areas unanimously expressed their determination to sever religious ties with imperialism and implement the reform program of Chinese Catholic autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation. In the declaration of 333 Catholics in the Nanchong Diocese, led by Bishop Wang Wencheng and Vicar General Zhong Bingliang, it was explicitly stated that they would fundamentally change the system of Chinese Catholicism being controlled by imperialists, adhering to the basic spirit of Chinese people propagating the Chinese religion; and expressed their determination to resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements within the Catholic Church who are willing to serve imperialism.

The reform declarations of Catholics in various places all expressed their sincere support for the Common Program of the CPPCC, strengthening political study, and eliminating the ideological toxins spread by imperialism. The declarations of Catholics in Yingshan, Tongnan, and Anyue counties in Northern Sichuan Region and Luzhou in Southern Sichuan Region all proposed that Catholics should study hard, transform themselves, actively participate in productive labor, and overcome all difficulties that the Church itself may encounter in the reform process. Some Catholics have also established patriotic covenants, and they will promote the reform movement with practical actions.

Before issuing their declarations, Catholics in various places mostly held reform symposiums to exchange reform opinions. Anyue County in Northern Sichuan Region issued a reform declaration after holding a county-wide meeting of Catholics. Catholics in Nanchong also jointly held a conference with local Christians to accuse American imperialism of using religion to carry out aggressive criminal activities. In addition, Catholics in various places actively participated in the nationwide movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect the homeland. Catholics in Chongqing, Kunming, Nanchong, and Jiajiang in Western Sichuan Region also held anti-American patriotic demonstrations separately or jointly with local Christians.

In order to continue to deepen the development of the reform movement, all patriotic Catholics in the Southwest Region believe that: it is extremely necessary to launch current affairs study in the future, and to hold mass accusation meetings against American imperialism, expose the hypocritical face of American imperialists, establish and consolidate the patriotic determination of Chinese Catholics, in order to gradually realize autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation, and further promote the reform movement from cities to rural churches.

　　拥护革新宣言割断与帝国主义的关系        
    西南七千余天主教徒签名        
    现正积极展开时事学习巩固爱国决心
    【新华社重庆十日电】川北行政区广元县王良佐神父等五百多天主教徒发起中国天主教自立革新运动后，西南区已有七个教区、包括二十五个市、县的天主教徒先后发表自立革新宣言或在宣言上签名。这二十五个市、县是重庆、昆明、泸州三市和川北区的广元、岳池、安岳、达县、江油、阆中、南充、营山、中江、潼南、遂宁、射洪、乐至、蓬溪、西充、川西区的夹江，川南区的宜宾、川东区的万县、永川、广安、邻水、江津等二十二个县。签名人数共七千五百五十一人，其中包括天主教南充教区主教王文成、副主教钟炳亮，重庆教区代理主教石明亮等主教和首先发起天主教革新运动的王良佐等六十八位神父（即司铎）。此外，成都、贵阳两市的天主教徒曾发表抗美援朝保家卫国宣言和保卫和平宣言。成都市天主教徒并曾举行爱国游行。
    上述各地天主教徒在革新宣言中，一致表示坚决割断宗教与帝国主义的关系，实行中国天主教自治、自养、自传的革新纲领。南充教区以王文成主教、钟炳亮副主教为首的三百三十三位天主教徒的宣言中，明确地表示将本着中国人传中国教的基本精神，从根本上改变中国天主教受制于帝国主义者的制度；并表示要坚决清除天主教会内部的甘愿为帝国主义服务的反革命分子。
    各地教徒的革新宣言都表示竭诚拥护人民政协共同纲领，加强政治学习，肃清帝国主义所散布的思想毒素。川北区营山、潼南、安岳及川南区泸州等地天主教徒的宣言都提出天主教徒应努力学习，改造自己，积极参加生产劳动，克服教会本身在革新过程中可能遭遇到的一切困难。有些地方的天主教徒并已订立了爱国公约，他们将以实际行动来推进革新运动。
    各地天主教徒在发表宣言前，大多先举行革新座谈会，交换革新意见。川北区安岳县在召开全县教徒会议以后才发出革新宣言。南充天主教徒并曾与当地基督教徒联合举行了控诉美帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略罪恶活动的大会。此外，各地天主教徒并积极参加全国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，重庆、昆明、南充及川西区夹江等地天主教徒并曾分别与当地基督教徒联合或单独举行了反美爱国的示威游行。
    为继续深入发展革新运动，西南地区一切爱国的天主教人士都认为：今后极需展开时事学习，并要举行群众性的反对美帝国主义的控诉会，揭发美帝国主义者的伪善面目，树立和巩固中国天主教徒的爱国决心，以便逐步地实现自治、自养和自传，并进一步将革新运动由城市推广到乡村的教堂中去。
