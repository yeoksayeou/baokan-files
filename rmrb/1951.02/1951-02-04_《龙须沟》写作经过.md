　　The Writing Process of "Dragon Beard Ditch"
    Lao She
    In my twenty-plus years of writing experience, writing "Dragon Beard Ditch" was the biggest adventure. It's true that before putting pen to paper, I read some reference materials and went to observe the area firsthand. However, none of that helped me fully understand Dragon Beard Ditch.

    But sometimes adventure is action inspired by enthusiasm, pushing forward regardless of success or failure. My adventure in writing "Dragon Beard Ditch" was like that. You see, Dragon Beard Ditch is a famous stinking ditch in Beijing. The banks of the ditch are full of hardworking and law-abiding people. For many years, the reactionary government regarded the people as worthless weeds, not caring how stinky, how dirty, how harmful the ditch water (actually, not water, but thick mud) was. No one ever bothered to ask. Not only that, the corrupt officials swallowed the people's donations for repairing the ditch more than once. In the spring of 1950, the People's Government decided to repair the ditch for the people. Among the many tasks of building a new Beijing, this was particularly worthy of praise. Because first: the government was not economically well-off, but it was determined to eliminate filth and harm for the people. Second: the government was not like the previous reactionary rulers, only caring about building roads and buildings for dignitaries, nor was it only concerned with repairing main thoroughfares to present a false image of peace and prosperity, but instead first tackled the most pressing issues. Although Dragon Beard Ditch was in a remote area, the government did not ignore it because it was remote. This is the People's Government, so it truly serves the people.

    Thus, those grateful to the government are more than just the people of Dragon Beard Ditch. Everyone with a heart should be included! I was moved, and I wanted to write about this, regardless of whether I wrote it well or not. My enthusiasm for thanking the government made me dare to take the risk.

    But how to write it? I couldn't move the stinking ditch onto the stage. Even if it were possible, that wouldn't be a popular way to do it. I still had to write about the stinking ditch; if I made up a story at random that wasn't closely related to the stinking ditch, then I would only be aiming for an exciting plot, and it would be easy to forget the responsibility of reflecting the capital's construction. I couldn't do that; I had to write about that ditch. After thinking it over, I decided: first: this must be a short play, at most three acts, because the longer it is, the harder it is to write. Second: it doesn't necessarily have to have a story, just write about some impressions. Based on these decisions, I thought: if I could write some characters, all of whom are related to the ditch, like some small tributaries of the ditch, couldn't I bring out the ditch through the characters' words and actions? Their language and actions don't have to be the link of a story, but rather the explanation of the stinking ditch.

    Good! I started thinking about characters. Since the play is small, there shouldn't be too many characters. I saw a small courtyard in my mind, right next to the stinking ditch. Several old and young men and women live in this courtyard, and some things happen in this small courtyard. Good, this small courtyard is like a small stele on the edge of the stinking ditch, explaining the sins of the stinking ditch. Yes, they must have many other difficulties in life, but I can't take care of them all. My eyes are always on their relationship with the stinking ditch. In this way, I can grasp the stinking ditch and achieve my praise for the People's Government for repairing the ditch for the people. As for the lack of story and the lack of description of the characters in their daily lives, there is no way to take care of both.

    This play is very difficult to write. Thanks to the leaders and workers of the People's Art Theater for giving me a lot of encouragement and help to complete it. They wanted the first draft and decided to try to rehearse it. I discussed with them many times and supplemented and revised the first draft. During the rehearsal period, the actors constantly went to Dragon Beard Ditch—where it was extremely smelly—to experience life. The theater dared to adopt this play that didn't look like a play, and the actors didn't avoid the summer heat and weren't afraid of the dirt and stench, probably because: if we were stingy with praise for such a good government, we would be abandoning our responsibility.

    Mr. Jiao Juyin directed the play while ill and deliberated on the script word by word for the author, providing suggestions for improvement, which is very grateful. If this play can have a fairly good effect during the performance, it must be due to the serious and hard work of the staff and actors, and Mr. Jiao's Midas touch directing skills.

　　《龙须沟》写作经过
    老舍
    在我的二十多年的写作经验中，写《龙须沟》是个最大的冒险。不错，在执笔以前，我阅读了一些参考资料，并且亲临其境去观察；可是，那都并没有帮助我满膛满鬚的了解了龙须沟。
    不过冒险有时候是由热忱激发出来的行动，不顾成败而勇往直前。我的冒险写《龙须沟》就是如此。看吧！龙须沟是北京有名的一条臭沟。沟的两岸住满了勤苦安分的人民。多少年来，反动政府视人民如草芥，不管沟水（其实，不是水，而是稠嘟嘟的泥浆。）多么臭，多么脏，多么有害，向来没人过问。不单如此，贪官们还把人民捐献的修沟款项吞吃过不止一次。一九五○年春，人民政府决定替人民修沟。在建设新北京的许多事项里，这是件特别值得歌颂的。因为第一：政府经济上并不宽裕，可是还决心的为人民除秽去害。第二：政府不像先前的反动统治者那么只管给达官贵人修路盖楼房，也不那么只管修整通衢大路，粉饰太平，而是先找最迫切的事情作。尽管龙须沟是在偏僻的地方，政府并不因它偏僻而忽视它。这是人民政府，所以真给人民服务。
    这样，感激政府的岂止是龙须沟的人民呢，有人心的都应当在内啊！我受了感动，我要把这件事写出来，不管写得好与不好。我的感激政府的热诚使我敢去冒险。
    可是，怎么写呢？我没法把臭沟搬到舞台上去；即使可能，那也不是叫座儿的好办法。我还得非写臭沟不可；假若我随便编造一个故事，并不与臭沟密切结合，便是只图剧情热闹，而很容易忘掉反映首都建设的责任；我不能那么办，我必须写那条沟。想来想去，我决定了：第一：这须是一本短剧，至多三幕，因为越长越难写。第二：它不一定有个故事，写一些印象就行。依着这些决定，我去思索：假如我能写出几个人物来，他们都与沟有关系，像沟的一些小支流，我不就可以由人物的口中与行动中把沟烘托出来了么？他们的语言与动作不必是一个故事的联系者，而是臭沟的说明者。
    好！我开始想人物。戏既小，人物就不要多。我心中看到一个小杂院，紧挨着臭沟沿儿。几位老幼男女住在这个杂院里，一些事情发生在这小院里。好，这个小院就是臭沟沿上的一块小碑，说明臭沟的罪恶。是的，他们必定另有许多生活上的困难，我可是不能都管到。我的眼睛老看着他们与臭沟的关系。这样，我就能抓住臭沟不放，达到我对人民政府为人民修沟的歌颂。至于其中缺乏故事性，和缺乏对人物在日常生活中的描写，就没法兼顾了。
    这本戏很难写。多亏了人民艺术剧院的领导者与工作者给了我许多鼓励与帮助，才能写成。他们要去初稿，并决定试排。我和他们又讨论了多次，把初稿加以补充与修改。在排演期间，演员们不断地到龙须沟——那里奇臭——去体验生活。剧院敢冒险的采用这不像戏的戏，和演员们的不避暑热，不怕脏臭，大概也都为了：有这样的好政府而我们吝于歌颂，就是放弃了我们的责任。
    焦菊隐先生抱着病来担任导演，并且代作者一字一句的推敲剧本，提供改善的意见，极当感激。假若这本戏，在演出时，能够有相当好的效果，那一定是由于工作人员和演员们的工作认真与努力，和焦先生的点石成金的导演手法。
