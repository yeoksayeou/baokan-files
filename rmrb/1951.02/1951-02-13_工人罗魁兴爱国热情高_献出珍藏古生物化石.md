　　Worker Luo Kuixing has high patriotic enthusiasm,
　  donates treasured paleontological fossils
    Editor:
    I am working as a clerk at the Harbin City Public Security Police Station. On the morning of January 20th, Luo Kuixing, a resident of 16 Renli Street in my jurisdiction, came to the police station with his group leader, holding two letters in his hand. He said, "Please, comrades, forward this little token of my appreciation to the front lines." When I opened the letter and listened to their conversation, I learned about the following story:
    He is an old worker who has worked at the Mashen Well for over twenty years. In the tenth year of the puppet Kangde regime, one day he went to San Keshu, about three or four miles from his home, to visit his ancestors' graves. He saw a rhinoceros skull fossil about one meter high that someone had dug up while excavating a kiln. He carried it home. Later, a friend saw it and asked him to sell it to the puppet museum in Harbin. He was very angry when he heard this and said, "Sell it to them? I wouldn't sell it to them for any amount of money! They don't treat us Chinese like human beings at all, how can I give it to them?" Later, as news of his fossil spread, he realized the situation was not good, so he dug a pit and buried the fossil.
    After the Northeast was liberated on "August 15th" and the People's Liberation Army entered Harbin, he dug the fossil out of the ground again. In October 1950, Chen Molin from the Geological Survey Institute of the Northeast Science Institute came to his home and saw the rhinoceros skull fossil, and after learning about it, determined it was an antique. Later, Comrade Chen talked to him, saying that the rhinoceros skull fossil was of great value for academic research, and if it could be placed in the Northeast Museum, many people could see this antique. He was very happy when he heard this and said, "Then take it quickly." When Comrade Chen asked him how much he wanted for it, he said very frankly, "What money? If you talk about money, you can just put it back!" After Comrade Chen took it away, he sent him a 500,000 yuan money order by registered mail. He was so moved when he received it that he didn't know what to do. He immediately held a family meeting. In the end, they decided that in addition to donating the 500,000 yuan, they would also donate the 500,000 yuan that the whole family had prepared for the Spring Festival to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. He also said, "Now we have such a good leader – Chairman Mao, and our China will be built up in a few years. By that time, the imperialists will no longer dare to bully us." The noble patriotism of old fellow Luo Kuixing is worthy of our study.

　　工人罗魁兴爱国热情高
　  献出珍藏古生物化石
    编辑同志：
    我是哈尔滨市公安派出所作内勤工作的。在一月二十日午前，有本所管内仁里街十六号居民罗魁兴同他本组的组长来本派出所，他手里拿着两封信。他说：“麻烦麻烦同志，把我这点意思给转到前方去。”我打开信一看，和听了他们谈话，才知道原来还有这末一段故事：
    他是一个打了二十多年马神井的老工人。在伪康德十年的时候，某一天他到离家三、四里地的三棵树去给祖宗上坟，他看见路旁有一个人家挖窑挖出来的一公尺左右高的犀头化石。当时他把它扛回家。以后有朋友看见，叫他卖到哈尔滨市伪博物馆去。他听到这话很生气地说：“卖给他们？给多少钱也不能卖给他们！他们拿我们中国人简直不当人啦，怎能给他们呢？”以后，他有化石的消息一天一天地传出去了，他一看事不好，就挖了一个坑，把化石埋藏起来了。
    “八一五”东北解放以后，人民解放军进入哈市，这时他又从地里把化石挖出来。在一九五○年十月间，有东北科学研究所地质调查所陈墨林到他家看到该犀头化石，经了解是一个古物。后来陈同志又和他谈，说该犀头化石对于学术研究上很有价值，如能放到东北博物馆去，能使很多人看到这种古物。当时他听到这话很高兴地说：“那末你快拿去吧。”当陈同志问他要多少钱的时候，他很直率地说：“要什么钱？如果谈到钱，你还是给我放下！”陈同志带走后，用双挂号的信给他邮来五十万元汇票。他接到后，感动得不知怎样好。他马上开了一个家庭会议。最后决定除了献出这五十万元外，再把全家准备过春节用的五十万元也献给我人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军。他还说：“咱们现在又有这样一位好当家的——毛主席，咱们中国用不上几年就能建设起来了。到那个时候，帝国主义者再也不敢来欺侮咱们。”像罗魁兴老乡这种高贵的爱国主义的精神是值得我们大家学习的。
