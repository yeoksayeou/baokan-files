Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th - According to a report from the Telegraph Agency: The World Peace Council held a press conference in Berlin on the 22nd. The conference was presided over by Nenni, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council. Nenni stated in his speech: The facts of the three months since the opening of the Warsaw Conference have proven that the Far East issue—including Taiwan, Korea, and all other issues related to the liberation movements of Asian people—cannot be resolved without convening a five-power conference. At the same time, a four-power conference to discuss the demilitarization of Germany is, in our view, a matter of paramount importance. Executive Bureau member and renowned Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg said: If the Bonn government is negotiating with the United States on the remilitarization of West Germany, this concerns the whole world. We support German unification because it is impossible to conclude a peace treaty with two Germanys, and concluding a peace treaty with Germany is a prerequisite for peace.
　　Japanese representative Kazuo Kawamura stated: By the end of last year, six million Japanese people had signed the peace declaration. Now, a signature campaign advocating the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty is being widely carried out.
　　American representative Reverend Dahl pointed out: Now, the United States is planning to conscript eighteen-year-old youths into the army. In order to implement Truman's policies, every worker has to give up one day's wages per week. When prices soared to their peak, the US government ordered the freezing of wages and prices, which has further deepened the American people's opposition to the Truman government.

　　世界和平理事会举行记者招待会
  　主张开五大国会议解决远东问题
  　并开四国会议讨论德国非军事化问题
    【新华社二十五日讯】据电通社柏林讯：世界和平理事会于二十二日在柏林举行记者招待会。招待会由世界和平理事会执行局副主席南尼主持。南尼发言称：华沙大会开幕后三个月来的事实证明，不召开五大国会议就不能解决远东问题——包括台湾、朝鲜、及其他一切与亚洲人民解放运动有关的问题在内。同时，一个讨论德国非军事化问题的四国会议，在我们看来是具有头等重要性的事情。执行局委员、苏联名作家爱伦堡说：如果波恩政府正在与美国谈判西德的重新军事化，这就关涉到全世界。我们赞成德国统一是因为不可能与两个德国缔结和约，而与德国缔结和约乃是和平的先决条件。
    日本代表河村一夫称：到去年年底为止，日本人民已有六百万人在和平宣言上签了名。现在征集主张缔结全面和约的签名运动正在广泛展开。
    美国代表达尔牧师指出：现在，美国正拟征召十八岁的青年入伍。为了执行杜鲁门的政策，每个工人每周都要拿出一天的工资。当物价上涨达到最高峰的时候，美国政府却下令冻结工资与物价，这已进一步加深了美国人民反对杜鲁门政府的情绪。
