　　China, Korea, Hungary Embrace Together
　　Du Gao
　　The truck loaded with medicine set off from Pyongyang.

　　When accepting the task, escort Wang Huaiduo guaranteed to his superiors: "We will definitely deliver these medicines to the front-line battlefield hospital. Under any circumstances, we will complete the task!" He remembers that when the truck was about to depart, Political Commissar Zhang specially came to shake Wang Huaiduo's hand and said: "Comrade, remember, this truckload of medicine was sent to us by the Hungarian people!" Wang Huaiduo just nodded firmly, turned around, and jumped into the truck.

　　In the darkness, the truck quickly left Pyongyang, and then sped across the slippery and steep mountains covered in freezing ice and snow.

　　Wang Huaiduo and Korean comrade Lao Jin sat shoulder to shoulder on the medicine boxes. The biting cold wind stabbed their faces like needles, causing ice to form on their eyebrows and beards. Their eyes, dampened by snowflakes, vaguely watched the snow-covered road quickly pass under the truck.

　　The medicine truck was speeding along.

　　Every piece of gauze, or every bottle of medicine, deeply implies an expectation of victory, a cheer for victory, and also expresses the love and respect, condolences and support of peace-loving people for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

　　The truck quickly rushed across the Daedong River. The Daedong River is a large river south of Pyongyang, separating Pyongyang and Seoul. After the enemy retreated, they blew up the river bridge. The water in the river has not frozen over and is still flowing rapidly. The bridge cannot be repaired, and the enemy is constantly bombing the river bridge to prevent our transportation. However, our supplies and our soldiers must rush across here! War is often like this, not only tempering our will, but also tempering the wisdom of every soldier. The comrades of our engineering battalion, disregarding all dangers and difficulties, used their bravery and wisdom to create a good way to cross the river.

　　When the medicine truck crossed the Daedong River, it was so dark that almost nothing could be seen. Snow continued to fall. The sky was dark, and the water was dark. Wang Huaiduo was worried that the truck would accidentally slip into the water, so he and Lao Jin soaked in the water, directing the truck to cross the river safely.

　　At this time, Wang Huaiduo and Lao Jin didn't think about the cold—although they were cold, cold to the point of pain, cold to the point of discomfort—but as long as they thought about this great task, and the Hungarian people who donated these medicines, they felt a warmth in their hearts, a sense of solemn and proud happiness.

　　After the truck safely crossed the river, Lao Jin fainted. Wang Huaiduo and the driver helped him onto the truck and covered him with all the coats. The truck continued to move forward. Wang Huaiduo lay on the box, laboriously moving his legs, which could no longer move. He bit his lip hard, not allowing himself to show any weakness due to discomfort. This arduous effort continued until he fell asleep, thinking in his heart: "When it dawns, light a fire..."

　　Near dawn, they all woke up from the cold. At this time, the truck was speeding at the foot of a large mountain. The snow had stopped, but their coats and cotton trousers were frozen with a layer of ice, tightly stuck to the medicine boxes.

　　Wang Huaiduo asked Lao Jin: "Can you still hold on?"

　　Lao Jin smiled and said, "What about you? - I'm the same as you!"

　　The sky slowly began to brighten. The truck decided to stop in a small gully.

　　They managed to struggle out of the ice and sat up. As soon as Lao Jin jumped out of the truck, he let out a cry of "Ouch" and fell to the snow. Wang Huaiduo's legs also hurt so much that he couldn't stand up. But he insisted on climbing down from the truck and immediately told the driver to quickly camouflage the truck to prevent it from being discovered by airplanes. Around the truck were houses that had been bombed, and a few burnt wooden frames stood stiffly, as if the strongest wind could not blow them down. There were bullet marks everywhere, and several American jeeps with missing tires lay in the gully, looking mournful.

　　Wang Huaiduo stood up with effort. He and the driver discussed unloading the medicine boxes first and burying them separately in the snow to avoid accidents.

　　As they were unloading the boxes, Lao Jin also climbed up, no matter how much they tried to dissuade him. The three of them moved all the boxes to the small gully and hid them well.

　　At this time, a twelve or thirteen-year-old Korean girl suddenly appeared. The child was dragging a thin white cloth skirt and wrapping her feet in cotton. She was shivering silently from the cold. - She walked over and asked with wide eyes, "China?"

　　"China, Chinese!" Wang Huaiduo answered the child loudly.

　　The child smiled and walked up to him. What made Wang Huaiduo happy was how calm this child was, how well she knew how to love and care for a soldier - because she silently placed her thin little hand on his broad knee.

　　"Aren't you cold?" Wang Huaiduo touched the child's shoulders, which were only covered by a thin layer of clothing.

　　The child couldn't understand Chinese, and just stared with wide eyes.

　　Lao Jin asked her in Korean: "Where is your mother?"

　　"I don't know," the child answered simply, but her eyes were full of hope, which made everyone silent.

　　"What is this?" the child asked curiously, pointing to the two wooden boxes next to her.

　　"These are medicines. These are from the Hungarian people - do you know Hungary? Huh? - It's them, sent from far away to us. These medicines will heal the wounds of the soldiers of the People's Army and the Volunteer Army. Once the wounds are healed, they can go and fight the American devils again!" Lao Jin said to the child.

　　"Fight the American devils!" The child was so happy that her eyes filled with tears.

　　Wang Huaiduo hugged the Korean child in his arms, wrapped his coat around her thin body, and also took out some dry food from his bag and put it in her mouth.

　　They sat around in the snow. Lao Jin sang the "Song of General Kim Il-sung" in a low voice, and Wang Huaiduo also learned a few lines. ...

　　Just at this moment, two enemy planes flying extremely low swooped down from the other side of the mountain. Following that, a strong gust of wind blew off the truck's camouflage.

　　"Damn it, they're flying so low, it's like they're skimming the ground!" the driver said resentfully.

　　The two enemy planes were circling.

　　"Lie down quickly!" Wang Huaiduo ordered everyone, only worrying about the medicines hidden in the ground.

　　The enemy planes started strafing.

　　"It's bad!" Lao Jin pushed Wang Huaiduo.

　　"Calm down, even if a bullet hits you, don't move!"

　　The machine gun bullets landed on the medicine boxes and started a fire.

　　"It's burning, what should we do?" Lao Jin shouted anxiously.

　　Wang Huaiduo stared hatefully at the burning medicine in front of him. The fire was getting bigger and bigger, and more and more bullets were falling. He stood up, took off his coat, and rushed towards the fire. He shouted loudly: "Comrades, rescue them! If the medicines burn, how can we face the Hungarian people?"

　　Lao Jin and the driver also rushed over regardless of everything. At this time, the child suddenly leaned over the two wooden boxes next to her and hugged them tightly with her hands! - Yes, they were all doing everything they could to protect the medicines! Even in the fire, under the hail of bullets!

　　Ten minutes later, the enemy planes flew away.

　　When the fifty-six boxes of medicine were safely loaded onto the truck, next to the truck, on top of two intact medicine boxes, lay the child's body quietly. Her back was facing the sky, and on her back, there were five bullet holes. Fresh blood gushed out, soaking her clothes, and flowed all the way to the wooden boxes. Her hands tightly embraced the boxes as if embracing the Hungarian people; she still had a piece of unchewed dry food in her mouth. ...

　　Wang Huaiduo held the child in his own injured arms.

　　China, Korea, Hungary, intertwined blood and anger, and consolidated common beliefs with life and will!

　　The medicine arrived at the battlefield hospital victoriously. The wounded shouted together in Korean and Chinese: "After we recover from our injuries, we will eliminate more American devils to repay you!"

　　中国、朝鲜、匈牙利拥抱在一起
　　杜高
    装满了药品的运输车，从平壤出发了。
    押运员王怀铎在接受任务的时候对上级保证过：“我们一定把这些药品运到前面的战地医院。在任何困难的情况下，我们也要完成任务！”记得是车子临开的时候，张政委还特别赶来，握着王怀铎的手说：“同志，要记牢啊，这满车的药品都是匈牙利人民送给我们的！”王怀铎只是坚定地点点头，转身就跳上车了。
    在黑夜里，车子一会儿就出了平壤，一会儿又疾驶在严寒冰雪的滑溜的峻岭上。
    王怀铎和朝鲜老金同志肩靠着肩坐在药品箱上，刺骨的冷风像针一样地扎在他们的脸上，使得他们的眉毛和胡须也都结上了冰。被雪花打湿了的眼睛也只模模糊糊地看着积雪的道路迅速地从车下滑过。
    药品车在驰驶着。
    每一块纱布，或者每一瓶药水，都是深深地含蓄着一个对胜利的期望，一个对胜利的欢呼，也都表现了爱好和平的人民对于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的爱和尊敬，慰问和支持！
    车子很快地就冲过大同江了。大同江，是平壤南面的一条大江流，横隔在平壤和汉城之间。敌人撤退以后就把江桥炸塌了，江里的水没有结上冰，仍在激流。桥梁没法修复，敌人为了阻挡我们的运输，一刻也不放松对江桥的滥炸。但是，我们的物资和我们的战士们必须从这里冲过去！战争常常是这样的，不但锻炼了我们的意志，也锻炼了每一个战士的智慧。我们的工兵营的同志们，不顾一切艰险困苦，以他们的勇敢与智慧创造了过江的好办法。
    药品车过大同江的时候，天黑得几乎半点都看不见，雪在继续落，天是黑的，水也是黑的。王怀铎当心车子一个不小心就滑到水里去，就和老金两个人泡在水里，指挥着车子平安地过江。
    在这个时候，王怀铎和老金都没有想到冷——虽然他们是冷的，冷得痛，冷得难受——但是，他们只要想一想这个伟大的任务，想一想捐送这些药品的匈牙利人民，他们就从心里感到一种温暖，感到一种严肃和骄傲的幸福。
    车子平安地过了江以后，老金晕过去了。王怀铎和司机同志把他抬到车子上，把所有的大衣都给他盖起来。车子继续向前驶动了。王怀铎躺在箱子上，困难地移动着他那已经再也无法动弹的两只腿。他用力地咬着嘴唇，不让自己因为难受而显出半点弱者的样子来。这样刻苦的努力一直维持到他睡过去。心里一边想着：“天亮了，烧把火……”
    挨近天亮的时候，他们都冷醒了。这时，车子正在一个大山脚下飞快地开着。雪已经停了，但是他们的大衣，棉裤都冻上了一层冰，和药品箱子紧紧地结在一块。
    王怀铎问老金：“还支持得住么？”
    老金笑着说：“你呢？——我和你一样！”
    天慢慢地亮起来了。车子就决定在一个小山沟子里停下来。
    他们好容易挣脱冰冻坐了起来。老金刚一跳下车子，接着“哎唷”一声就倒在雪地上，王怀铎的腿也痛得站不起来了。但他还是坚持着爬下车来，立刻告诉司机，要把车子赶紧伪装起来，免得飞机发现。在车的四周，到处都是被炸塌的房屋，几根被烧枯了的木架子，却坚硬得像是最强烈的劲风也吹不倒它们似的挺立着。到处都是弹痕，也有几辆掉了轮胎的美国吉普车哭丧着面孔似的躺在山沟里。
    王怀铎使劲地站了起来。他和司机同志商量先把药品箱卸下来分散埋在雪地里，免得发生意外。
    当他们卸箱子的时候，老金也爬起来了，怎么劝都不行。三个人就一下子把所有的箱子都移到了小山沟子里，隐藏得好好的。
    这时，突然出现了一个十二、三岁的朝鲜女孩子，这孩子拖着一条薄薄的白布裙，用棉花包了自己的脚，她全身冷得在无声地颤抖。——她走过来，睁着一双大眼睛问：“中国？”
    “中国，中国人！”王怀铎响亮地回答了孩子。
    孩子笑了。走到他的面前来。使王怀铎感到高兴的是，这孩子多么沉着，这么懂得来爱和体贴一个战士——因为她默默地把她那付瘦小的手安放在他那宽大的膝盖上了。
    “你不冷么？”王怀铎摸着孩子只穿了一层薄衣的肩膀。
    孩子听不懂中国话，只瞪着一双大眼睛。
    老金用朝鲜话问她：“你的妈妈呢？”
    “我不知道。”孩子很干脆地回答，但眼睛里却充满希望，使得大家都沉默下来了。
    “这是什么？”孩子好奇地指着在她旁边的两个木箱子。
    “这是药品，这是匈牙利人民——你知道匈牙利么？呃？——是他们，从老远送给我们的，这些药品要医好人民军和志愿军战士们的伤口。伤好了，就可以再去打美国鬼子！”老金对孩子这么说。
    “打美国鬼子！”孩子高兴得眼睛里都含满了泪水。
    王怀铎把朝鲜孩子抱在自己的怀里，把大衣裹着她那瘦小的身体，也从袋子里摸出了一些干粮，塞在她的嘴里。
    他们围坐在雪地里，老金低声地唱着《金日成将军颂歌》，王怀铎也学会了好几句。……
    正在这个时候，从山的那一边，两架飞得极低的敌机俯冲过来。跟着，一阵猛烈的风掀掉了汽车的伪装。
    “他妈的，飞得多低呀，好像从地上擦过去似的！”司机恨恨地说。
    两架敌机在盘旋了。
    “快躺下！”王怀铎命令大家。心里只耽心着那些隐藏在地里的药品。
    敌机果然开始扫射了。
    “糟了！”老金推着王怀铎。
    “沉着些，子弹打中了你，也不许动！”
    机枪的子弹落在药品箱上，烧起来了。
    “烧起来了，这怎么办呢？”老金着急地嚷着。
    王怀铎仇恨地望着前面燃烧的药品。火越来越大，子弹也越落越多。他站起来，脱下自己的大衣朝火堆扑了过去。一边大声地喊着：“同志们，抢救呀！药品烧了我们还有什么脸见匈牙利人民呢？”
    老金和司机也不顾一切地跟着扑了过去。孩子在这个时候，一下俯在她旁边的两个木箱子上，用手紧紧地把它们抱了起来！——是的，他们都在尽自己的一切能力来保卫药品！尽管是在火堆里，是在子弹的包围底下！
    十分钟以后，敌机飞走了。
    当五十六箱药品平安地搬上汽车的时候，在车的旁边，在两只完整无损的药品箱子上，静静地躺着孩子的尸体。她的背朝天，在背上面，有五个子弹的窟窿，鲜血冒了出来，浸透了她的衣裳，一直流到木箱子上。她的手紧紧地抱住箱子像拥抱着匈牙利人民；她的嘴里还咬了一块没有咀嚼的干粮。…
    王怀铎用他自己受伤的手抱住了孩子。
    中国，朝鲜，匈牙利，把血和愤怒都交织在一起，用生命和意志巩固了共同的信念！
    药品胜利地到达了战地医院。伤员们用着朝鲜话和中国话一齐喊着：“伤好以后，多消灭美国鬼子，来报答你们！”
