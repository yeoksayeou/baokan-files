　　Domestic Literary and Art Developments

　　The Shanghai Woodcut Research Association held a symposium on January 21st to discuss the publication of "Woodcut Magazine." The first issue of the magazine will be published at the end of March, and submissions are now being solicited.

　　Chinese woodcut art has made significant achievements in the past twenty years, but its development has been relatively slow in recent years and has not received due attention. It is hoped that the publication of Woodcut Magazine will improve this situation.

　　The political departments of the major military regions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have compiled and printed various literary and art collections and periodicals, and some have also published a large number of popular readings, soldier readings, and literary and art series for the troops. This is an important contribution to Chinese people's literature and art. For example, the series compiled and printed by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army includes Liu Baiyu's short story collection "Invincible Three Warriors," Bai Hua's script "Yang Yong's Meritorious Service," Hua Shan's collection of communications reports "Heroic October," and Xiao Xiangrong's literary and art essays "On the Literary and Art Movement in the Troops," etc., and eight volumes have now been published. The Soldier Life Series it publishes includes more than ten volumes such as Xi Hong's "Home," Lu Ying's "Tang Erhu," and Li Xiaocang's "The Daze Township Uprising." The Troop Literary and Art Series published by the Political Department of the Second Field Army includes Han Feng's "The Party and Life," and Zeng Ke's "Assault," etc., and eighteen volumes have now been published. The People's Soldier Small Series it publishes has also published four volumes. In addition, the North China Military Region has also compiled and printed a series of troop literary and art readings such as Liu Baiyu's "Firelight Ahead," etc.

　　The "Yangtze River Literature and Art" monthly organized a discussion of Cao Guimei's works in the fourth issue of Volume 3. Comrade Cao Guimei is a security guard from a working-class background. He has written three poetry collections, "A Brief Biography of Cao Guimei," "Recollections of Shijiazhuang," and "Changes in Huaidi Township," which have attracted great attention from readers after publication. These three long poems all depict his own life experiences, with content that is real and simple, and expresses the author's great enthusiasm for the revolution. In the discussion, four comrades put forward opinions on his works, pointed out his strengths and weaknesses in creation, and the direction of efforts he should take. Such help and encouragement to working-class writers is worth promoting.

　　The 31st issue of Northeast Pictorial, published on January 31st, is a special issue on the Chinese people's aid to the Korean War of Liberation. This special issue collected many moving photos of Korea's "beautiful mountains and rivers, working people," the heinous crimes of the American invading army, the dispatch of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the close unity and heroic victorious operations of the Korean military and civilians, the captured American soldiers, and the enthusiastic support of the Northeast people for the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is the best of the pictorials publishing the same type of pictures, and it is worth adapting into a picture album for mass distribution throughout the country and introduction abroad.

　　国内文艺动态
    上海木刻研究会于一月二十一日召开座谈会，讨论《木刻杂志》发刊问题。该杂志将于三月末发刊第一期，现已开始征稿。
    我国木刻艺术在二十年来已有重大的成就，但近年的发展却比较慢，并且没有受到应有的注意。希望木刻杂志的发刊能对这种现象加以改善。
    中国人民解放军各大军区政治部都编印了各种文艺专集、文艺刊物，有的还大量出版了通俗读物、战士读物、部队文艺丛书等。这对于中国人民文艺是一个重要的贡献。例如第四野战军政治部编印的丛书收有刘白羽等的小说集《无敌三勇士》、白华的剧本《杨勇立功》，华山等的通讯报告集《英雄的十月》和萧向荣等的文艺论文《论部队文艺运动》等，现已出版八册。它所出版的战士生活丛书，包括西虹的《家》、陆荧的《唐二虎》、李啸仓的《大泽乡起义》等十多册。第二野战军政治部出版的部队文艺丛书，有寒风的《党和生命》、曾克的《突击》等，现已出版十八册。它所出版的人民战士小丛书也已出版了四本。此外，华北军区也编印了刘白羽等的《火光在前》等部队文艺读物丛书多册。
    《长江文艺》月刊在三卷四期中组织了对曹桂梅作品的笔谈。曹桂梅同志是工人出身的警卫员，曾写了《曹桂梅小传》、《回忆石家庄》、《槐底乡变迁》三本诗集，出版后，引起读者很大的注意。这三篇长诗，都是描写他自身经历过的生活，内容真实、朴素，表现了作者对革命的巨大热情。在笔谈中，有四位同志针对他的作品提出了意见，并指出了他在创作上的优缺点，和应当采取的努力方向。这样的对工人写作者的帮助和鼓励，值得提倡。
    一月三十一日出版的东北画报第三十一期，是一个中国人民援助朝鲜解放战争的专号。这一个专号对于朝鲜的“美丽的山河，劳动的人民”，对于美国侵略军的万恶罪行，对于中国人民志愿军的出动和朝鲜军民的亲密团结以及英勇的胜利的作战，对于被俘虏的美军，对于东北人民热烈支援中国人民志愿军的情形，都搜集了许多动人的照片。这是登载同一类图片的画刊中最好的一册，值得改编为画册在全国大量发行，并且介绍到国外去。
