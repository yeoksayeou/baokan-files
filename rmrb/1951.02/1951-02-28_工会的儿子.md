　　The Son of the Trade Union
　　Chen Sishu

　　I was chatting with driver Liu Heting in the trade union office when his wife, leading a toddler, walked in from the yard. Liu Heting, as if reminded of something, turned to me and said, "This is our Dashan, we call him 'the son of the trade union!'" "'The son of the trade union'?" I paused, suddenly recalling a story I heard the day I arrived in Fengtai.

　　...At that time, Old Liu's model locomotive, ㄇㄎ一——一九三九 (MK1-1939), was busy creating a record of 100,000 kilometers of safe driving. The old hero Li Yonglu happened to be going to Tianjin for a meeting. Before leaving, he called Zhang Zuyao and Liu Heting aside and said, "We only need a little over two thousand kilometers of safe driving to reach 100,000 safe kilometers. I entrust all responsibility to you. Be extra careful, don't let our locomotive lose face at the last hurdle."

　　Old Zhang and Old Liu were both veterans at driving. Accepting this task, although feeling a bit of pressure, they were mindful and cautious, and dared to assure Old Hero Li that the locomotive would not have any problems while they were on duty.

　　However, not two days after Old Hero Li left, an unexpected event occurred.

　　One evening, Old Liu returned from duty and had just stepped into his house when his wife greeted him with tears.

　　"While you were away,...Shan'er got sick....He won't drink milk,...won't open his eyes,...his body is burning hot,...he coughs all day long...after coughing, he keeps wheezing...How am I supposed to live through this?" His wife said, each word a tear.

　　Old Liu went to the bedside and saw that the child had indeed lost weight, staring with wide eyes, constantly gasping for breath. Looking at the child's pitiful state, Old Liu's heart felt as if it were being pinched by pliers. "Did you take him to the hospital?"

　　"As soon as he got sick, your father and I took him to the railway branch hospital. The doctor said he had pneumonia and that there were no special medicines here. If we wanted to treat him, we had to go to Beijing quickly."

　　"They said that, and you had no choice, is that right?"

　　"We also took him to the private relief hospital and gave him two injections of penicillin, which seemed to make him better; but after taking the few packets of medicine they gave him in the evening, he immediately became worse..."

　　"Enough!"

　　Hearing this, Old Liu didn't even bother to eat dinner and ran out. After a while, he found a local Chinese medicine doctor. That person took a look, turned around, and walked out. In the yard, he said to Old Liu, "The wind has already entered his lungs, it's hard to treat." Old Liu felt truly disheartened, wishing he could grab that man's small round cap and give him a good beating.

　　This unexpected event tormented Old Liu. It was said that his body was already too tired to bear and he needed rest. But how could he do that? He was in his thirties, and had finally gotten a son. He lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep all night.

　　The next day, Zhang Zuyao, who worked with Old Liu, ran to the trade union and told the trade union director, Old Ma, and the labor insurance committee member, Old Zhao, the whole story, seeking their advice. He said: Old Liu didn't sleep a wink last night, his spirit is terrible. This morning, when he was about to go to work, his wife clung to him, refusing to let go, saying, "Now that you're back, I'll leave the child to you. Only go to work when he is fully better..." Naturally, Old Liu and his wife had a fight, and he arrived at the section with a gloomy face. Old Ma said, "Stop beating around the bush, Old Zhang, what do you think is the best way to handle this?" Old Zhang said, "I see two options. One is for the trade union to take responsibility for helping the child get medical treatment, so that he can drive with peace of mind and not ruin the 100,000 kilometers of safe driving task assigned by the higher authorities. The other is to give him a few days off, lend him some money, and let him take the child to Beijing himself. However, the latter option is not reliable. First, if he leaves, replacing him with an unfamiliar driver who doesn't know the locomotive's quirks could easily cause problems. Second, he's unfamiliar with Beijing, doesn't know the hospital admission procedures, and rushing in headfirst will not solve the problem; if the child's illness is delayed, it will hurt his emotions even more." Upon hearing this, Old Ma felt that Old Zhang's words were very correct, so he convened an emergency meeting of the trade union committee. The meeting decided that the trade union would be responsible for treating Old Liu's child, and if his family had any other difficulties, the trade union would find a way to solve them.

　　So, labor insurance committee member Zhao Guangrun got busy. He first went to Old Liu's house to comfort him, and then went to the railway branch hospital to find Doctor Zhang. Doctor Zhang said, "Old Liu's child's illness has been delayed for several days. It's hard to say whether he can be cured or not. But if he's to be treated, he must quickly go to Beijing to buy 'Streptomycin' and 'Oil Penicillin'."

　　Old Zhao returned to the section without even drinking a sip of water, and rushed to the station with a backpack.

　　In the afternoon, he hurried to fill out the guarantee form, pay the fees, and handle other admission procedures. After completing the procedures, the trade union sent over several quilts... settling Old Liu's wife comfortably.

　　For several days in a row, Old Zhao took time to go to the hospital, personally watching the nurses take temperatures and the doctors give injections, and the child's mother feed the child soup and medicine. He didn't even go back to his own house to sleep at night. When he felt tired, he would collapse on the sofa in the hospital...

　　On the third day after admission, the illness was obviously reduced. The temperature dropped from 41 degrees Celsius to 38 degrees. His eyes were open, he was drinking milk, the number of coughs decreased, and when he slept, he was as stable and quiet as a kitten lying on a stove. Old Zhao came out of the hospital and met Doctor Zhang in the corridor. Doctor Zhang said, "Old Zhao, you haven't been busy for nothing this time! Old Liu's child is getting better today, and there won't be any danger in the future."

　　Three days later, it was the celebratory day for locomotive ヮㄎ一——一九三九 (WK1-1939) completing 100,000 kilometers of safe driving. To celebrate this victory, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot held a grand event that day. Old Liu was decorated with red silk, drinking wine, taking pictures... partying all day long. When he returned home in the evening, he happened to see his wife leaving the hospital with the child. He was extremely moved. When he saw Old Zhao carrying things and coming in with his wife, he quickly ran over and grabbed the other's hand. Finally, he said in a trembling voice, "The trade union is Shan'er's reborn parent, Shan'er is 'the son of the trade union.' Without the trade union's great help, things would never have had such a satisfactory ending today."

　　工会的儿子
    陈思树
    我和司机刘贺廷正在工会办公室里拉话，他的女人牵着一个刚会走路的小宝宝，从院里走进来。刘贺廷像想起一件心事似的，转过脸向我说：“这就是我们的大山，我们管他叫‘工会的儿子！’”“‘工会的儿子’？……”我楞了一下，突然记起刚到丰台那天，我听到的一个故事。
    ……那时候，老刘他们的冖ㄎ一——一九三九号模范机车，正在忙着创造十万安全公里的纪录。老英雄李永禄赶巧要到天津开会去。临走，他把张祖耀和刘贺廷两个人叫到一边，说：“再有两千多公里的安全行车，咱们就可达到十万安全公里了。我把一切责任托付给你们，你们要多加小心，可别叫咱们这台机车，在最后的一道关口上丢了脸。”
    老张和老刘，在开车上都是老手。接下这个任务，虽说也有一点沉重的感觉；但是，提着神儿，谨谨慎慎地干，也敢向李老英雄打包票，保证出勤时机车不出岔子。
    可是，李老英雄刚走了没有两天，突然发生了一件意外的事情。
    有一天晚上，老刘出勤回来，刚踏进家门，他的女人就啼哭着迎上去。
    “你不在家的时候，……山儿得病了。……奶也不吃，……眼也不睁，……身上热得火烧火燎，……一天到晚，不断地咳嗽……，咳嗽完，就哧溜哧溜地发喘……你看这日子叫我怎么活下去？”他女人一句话一把泪的说。
    老刘到床边一看，可不是，孩子瘦多了，瞪着两个大眼，一个劲在喘气，望着孩子可怜的样儿，老刘的心就像被钳子夹住一样难受。“到医院看过没有？”
    “刚生病，我和咱爹就把孩子抱到铁路分院。院里大夫说是得了肺炎；又说这儿没有特效药，要看嘛，得赶紧上北京。”
    “人家那样说，你们就没法子了，是不是？”
    “我们还抱他到私立救济医院，打了两针盘尼西林，回来显得好了些；但是，晚间吃下他们给的几包药，马上又沉重了。……”
    “甭说啦！”
    老刘听到这儿，饭也顾不得吃，就往外跑。停了一刻多钟，他找来一个本地的中医。那个人看了看，转身就往外走，到院里，他才对老刘说：“肺里已经起了风，不好治了。”弄得老刘心里真丧气，恨不得抓掉那人的小圆帽，痛痛地凑他一顿。
    这个意外的事儿，可把老刘害苦了。按说他身体已经劳累得不能支持了，很需要休息休息。可是那样怎能行呢？三十几岁啦，好容易熬上一个儿子，他躺在床上，翻来转去，一夜没睡着。
    第二天，和老刘在一块的张祖耀，跑到工会，把事情头尾说了一遍，向工会主任老马、劳保委员老赵讨主意，他说：老刘昨晚上一宿没睡觉，精神坏的很。今儿早起，他要上班，他女人死去活来的拉着他不肯放手，说：“你回来了，我把孩子交给你，多会看好多会你上班……”自然，老刘和他女人惹了一场气，一脸霉气的来到段上。老马说：“别绕弯子了，老张，你看怎么办好些？”老张说：“我看，有两个法子，一个是由工会负责帮助给孩子医病，让他安心跑车，别把上级交给的十万安全公里的任务闹垮了。一个是放他几天假，借给他一批钱，让他自个把孩子带到北京。不过，后一个法子不稳妥，第一，他走了，换个生司机代班，不摸机车的脾性，容易出岔子；第二，他带孩子上北京，人生地不熟，入院手续也搞不清，生冲硬撞，事情办不了，要是把孩子的病耽搁了，会更伤他的情绪。”老马一听，觉着老张的话很对，就召集工会委员，开了一个紧急会议，会上决定：老刘的孩子，由工会负责去给医治，他家里如有别的什么困难，也由工会设法解决。
    于是，劳保委员赵广润忙起来了。他先到老刘家里安慰一番，回来又到铁路分院找张大夫。张大夫说：“老刘孩子的病已经耽搁了好几天，能治好不能治好，很难断定。不过，要治就得赶快上北京买‘链霉素’和‘油脂盘尼西林’。”
    老赵回到段上，连口水也没喝，就挂着一个背包，赶到车站。
    下午回来，他又赶着填保证书，缴费，办其他入院手续，办完了手续，又由工会送过去几床被褥……把老刘的女人，安顿得妥妥贴贴。
    一连几天，老赵抽空就往医院里去，亲眼看着看护试表，医生打针，小孩的妈喂孩子喝汤吃药，夜里也不回自个家睡觉。遇着困的时候，就往医院里的沙发上一倒……
    入院以后的第三天，病势很显然地减轻了。温度从摄氏四十一度退到三十八度。眼也睁了，奶也吃了，咳嗽的次数也减少了，睡的时候，像卧在炉台上的小猫一样，很安稳，很静。老赵从医院里出来，在过道上碰见张大夫，张大夫说：“老赵，这一次你没有白忙！老刘的孩子，今天已经好起来了，今后决不会再有什么危险。”
    又过了三天，是ヮㄎ一——一九三九号机车，走完十万安全公里的喜庆日子。为了庆贺这个胜利，丰台机务段那天有一个盛会。老刘在段上披红挂彩吃酒、照像……整整闹了一天。晚上回到家里，赶巧又碰见他女人抱着孩子出院。他感动极了。当他看见老赵提着东西和他女人一道进来，赶紧跑过去握住对方的手。最后他声音发颤地说：“工会是山儿的重生父母，山儿是‘工会的儿子’，要不是工会大力帮忙，事情决不会有今天这么完满的收场。”
