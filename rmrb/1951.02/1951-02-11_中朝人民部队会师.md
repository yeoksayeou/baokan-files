　　After the New Year of 1951, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and a certain regiment of the Korean People's Army victoriously joined forces in a certain area of South Hamgyong Province amidst cheers celebrating the victory on the Eastern Front. When the news reached the People's Army unit, a certain regiment of the People's Army immediately notified all units to vacate houses. The soldiers of the regiment successively gave the brightest and largest rooms to the Volunteer Army, chopped firewood, heated the warm "炕" (platform bed), and swept the courtyard clean. The soldiers said, "Volunteer Army comrades are helping us resist the American aggressors, they have worked hard, we must treat them well!"

　　When the hands of those warriors, holding different weapons and fighting a common enemy, were clasped together, they shook them excitedly and looked at each other carefully, as if they were old friends reunited. People's Army soldier Kim Myung happily grabbed the hand of a Volunteer Army soldier. He wanted to tell him, "Comrade, we thank you!" But, he didn't understand Chinese and his face turned red in his haste. Suddenly, he shouted loudly, "Mao Zedong, good!" The Volunteer Army soldier immediately replied, "General Kim Il-sung, good!" The two kept smiling at each other for five minutes. Han Shixian was invited to a house by the Volunteer Army, but because of the language barrier, he couldn't say many things. He could only sing the Chinese song "Forever Follow the Communist Party" that he had just learned in the breaks between battles. Immediately, the powerful songs of the Chinese and Korean soldiers merged together. Kim Hyun-myung, a sixteen-year-old marksman of the People's Army who had sunk an enemy cruiser in the Battle of Chongjin and was awarded the Second Class Order of Glory, wrote to a Volunteer Army officer: "Celebrate you with world peace and democracy!" Volunteer Army soldier Wang Zhixiang said to the People's Army soldiers: "If the people of China and Korea unite, we will surely drive away the aggressors!" Walking through every room, one could see groups of Chinese and Korean warriors sitting around the warm "炕" and talking intimately. The difference in language did not hinder the strong combat friendship between the warriors of the two countries. When the soldiers couldn't understand each other, they raised their hands and shouted: "Stalin, Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung, good!" These simple words not only contained their love and gratitude for their common leaders and their anger at the common enemy, but also contained their infinite confidence in their own strength.

　　When the commanders of the artillery regiment of the Korean People's Army stationed in a certain area learned that the headquarters of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which had fought at Changjin Lake, was living in the same village as them, the village was immediately a sensation. Wu Jinghao, the political commissar of the People's Army, invited the section chiefs of the political department of the Volunteer Army to his room and shared a glass of victory wine. The youth instructors went to the Volunteer Army to find their "counterparts." Staff officers also got together to learn about work experience and inquire about heroic stories. Everyone took out notebooks and signed autographs for each other as souvenirs. Yoon Kyo-sang, a People's Army captain staff officer who had attended university, said that he yearned to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, saying, "After driving away the American aggressors, I will definitely go to Beijing to apply for the Revolutionary University!"

　　The performance troupe of a certain division of the People's Army, sixty miles away, braved the heavy snow to join the Volunteer Army in a celebration when they heard the news of the Volunteer Army's arrival. The performance troupe performed Korean folk dances, which were warmly welcomed by the Volunteer Army soldiers. When the performance troupe sang "Forever Follow the Communist Party" in Chinese, all the Chinese and Korean soldiers stood up and applauded and cheered. An old Chinese soldier immediately sang a "General Kim Il-sung Song" in Korean in response. The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of internationalism and revolutionary heroism. The soldiers all raised their hands and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" "Down with American imperialism!"

　　中朝人民部队会师
　　新华社朝鲜前线记者报道
    一九五一年新年过后，我国人民志愿军某部与朝鲜人民军某联队在庆祝东线大捷的欢呼声中，于咸镜南道某地胜利会师。当消息传到人民军部队时，人民军某联队立刻通知各单位腾让房子，该部战士纷纷把最明亮最宽大的房间让给志愿军住，劈好柴，烧好暖炕，把院子打扫得干干净净。战士们说：“志愿军同志帮助我们抵抗美国侵略者，他们辛苦了，我们要好好招待他们！”
    当那些握着不同的武器，打击着共同敌人的勇士们的手握在一起的时候，彼此兴奋地摇了又摇，仔细地端详着，像是老友重逢一样。人民军战士金明高兴地抓住一个志愿军战士的手，他想告诉他：“同志，我们感谢你们！”但是，他不懂中国话，急得脸都红了，忽然他高声喊起来：“毛泽东，好！”志愿军战士马上回答他：“金日成将军，好！”两人一直相对笑了五分钟。韩仕贤被志愿军邀请到房子里，由于言语不通，许多话讲不出来，他只好唱出在战斗空隙刚学会的一支“永远跟着共产党走”的中国歌，于是中、朝战士雄壮的歌声立刻交汇在一起。曾在清津战役击沉敌巡洋舰而荣获二等荣誉勋章的人民军十六岁的青年瞄准手金贤明，向一个志愿军军官写道：“以世界和平民主庆祝你！”志愿军战士王至祥向人民军战士说：“我们中、朝两国人民团结起来，一定能打走侵略者！”走过每一个房间，都可以看到成群的中、朝勇士，围坐在暖炕上亲密晤谈。语言的不同，并没有使两国勇士们之间浓厚的战斗友谊受到隔阂。当战士们讲不通话的时候，就举着手喊：“斯大林、毛泽东、金日成，好！”这些简单的言语，不只包含着他们对共同领袖的爱戴、感激和对共同敌人的愤怒，而且包含着对自己力量的无比信赖。
    当驻在某地的朝鲜人民军炮兵联队部的指挥员们，得悉和他们同住一村的是曾在长津湖畔作战的中国人民志愿军某团团部的时候，村上立刻轰动了。人民军政治联队长吴景镐把志愿军政治处的股长们邀请到自己的房间里，共饮了一杯胜利酒。青年指导员到志愿军部队去寻找他们的“同行”。参谋们也找到一起，了解工作经验，探询英雄的故事。大家掏出本子，互相签名留念。曾读过大学的人民军上尉参谋尹教相，述说他无限渴望到北京去见毛主席，他说：“在赶走美国侵略者后，我一定去北京投考革命大学！”
    远在六十里外的人民军某师演技团，听到志愿军到来的消息，冒了大雪，赶来与志愿军联欢。演技团演出朝鲜民间舞，受到志愿军战士的热烈欢迎。当演技团用中国话唱“永远跟着共产党走”的时候，中、朝战士全体起立鼓掌欢呼，一个中国老战士立即用朝鲜语唱了一支“金日成将军歌”来回答。整个会场上，充满了国际主义和革命英雄主义的友爱团结的气氛。战士们一齐举手高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”
