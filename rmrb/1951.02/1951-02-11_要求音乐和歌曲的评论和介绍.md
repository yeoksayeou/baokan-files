To the Editor:

We are some young people who don't understand music but often listen to music and songs. We are requesting reviews and introductions of music and songs.

Criticism of literature, drama, film, and fine arts is gradually increasing now, which is a good phenomenon. However, such criticism is very rare for music and songs. Although "People's Music" occasionally publishes one or two articles, this publication is not widespread enough, and these articles are not popular enough.

We hope that there can be regular and accessible reviews of all kinds of Chinese music, both new and old, of the music of all Chinese ethnic groups, of all kinds of foreign music, of music in operas, ballads, and films, of all kinds of melodies and lyrics, and of all kinds of playing and singing techniques.

Of course, criticism is also a kind of introduction. But we believe that other, more effective introductions are also needed. Truly good music and songs should be known to every household, which requires systematic dissemination. This dissemination should be carried out through radio stations, films, primary and secondary school music teachers, factory and office clubs, and the compilation of complete song collections. However, we feel that there is a serious lack of leadership in these areas. There seems to be no responsible selection or recommendation, and no promotion plan.

Our knowledge is limited, and these opinions may not be entirely accurate. We hope that the responsible comrades of the All-China Musicians Association can give us a reply.

    要求音乐和歌曲的评论和介绍编辑同志：
    我们是一些不懂音乐但是常常听听音乐和歌曲的青年，我们要求关于音乐和歌曲的评论和介绍。
    对于文学、戏剧、电影、美术的批评现在渐渐多起来了，这是很好的现象。但是对于音乐和歌曲，这种批评却非常少。《人民音乐》虽然间或发表一两篇，但是这个刊物流行还不够广，而且这些文章也不够通俗。
    我们希望，对于中国的各种新旧音乐，对于中国各民族的音乐，对于各种外国音乐，对于戏曲、曲艺和电影中的音乐，对于各式的曲调和各式的歌词，对于各式的奏法和唱法，都能经常有通俗的评论。
    评论当然也就是一种介绍。但是我们认为还需要其他的更有效的介绍。真正好的乐曲和歌曲，应当做到家喻户晓的地步，这就需要有系统的传播工作。应当经过广播电台，电影，中小学音乐教师，工厂机关的俱乐部，和编制完美的歌曲集，来进行这种传播工作。但是我们觉得，恰恰在这些方面，有很严重的无领导状态。似乎并没有什么负责的选择和推荐，也没有什么推广的计划。
    我们的见闻有限，这些意见可能不尽合乎实际。希望全国音乐工作者协会的负责同志能给我们一个答复。
