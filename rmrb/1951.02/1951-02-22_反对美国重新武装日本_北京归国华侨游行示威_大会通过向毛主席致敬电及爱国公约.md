Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Over a thousand returned overseas Chinese in Beijing held a demonstration parade against the U.S. arming of Japan this morning at the Cultural Palace of the Working People.

　　The congress first passed a 36-member presidium for the congress, including He Xiangning, Chen Jiageng, Situ Meitang, Peng Zemin, Liao Chengzhi, Hu Yuzhi, Chen Qiyuan, Cai Tingkai, Lian Guan, Yi Meihou, Li Tiemin, and Zhuang Xiquan. Hu Yuzhi, executive chairman of the congress and vice chairman of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, delivered a speech. Chen Manyun spoke on behalf of He Xiangning. In her speech, He Xiangning pointed out: "Today, returned overseas Chinese in Beijing and more than a dozen other major cities such as Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Haikou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Kunming, and Nanning are simultaneously holding demonstration parades against the U.S. arming of Japan. This is an unprecedented patriotic action in the history of overseas Chinese. We express our infinite concern for the more than ten million overseas Chinese who remain overseas and suffer the ravages and persecution of U.S. imperialism and reactionary governments such as Malaya. She said, "Our motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has become one of the powerful fortresses for defending world peace and has naturally become a strong backing for our overseas Chinese. We must do our best to support all actions of overseas Chinese in fighting to defend their legitimate rights." Finally, she called on returned overseas Chinese and their families to actively participate in the anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement, oppose the U.S.'s separate peace treaty and rearming of Japan, support land reform, assist the government in eliminating bandits and secret agents, and work hard to produce. Representatives of various democratic parties, Chen Qiyuan of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Luo Longji of the China Democratic League, Huang Dingchen of the China Zhi Gong Party, Mo Yichang of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Xue Yu of the Jiusan Society spoke in succession. They unanimously expressed their respect for the patriotic actions of overseas Chinese throughout history and encouraged overseas Chinese to continue to strengthen the patriotic movement. Lian Guan, vice chairman and member of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, said: Speaking of the Japanese imperialists' three-all policy and the great roundup in Singapore and the "Death Railway" in Siam (Note: During the Pacific War, the Japanese bandits forcibly seized a large number of overseas Chinese from Malaya and other places to build a railway from Siam to Burma. Many overseas Chinese died due to abuse and malaria.), these bloody historical facts are still vivid in our minds. But the U.S. imperialists now want to rearm Japan and slaughter overseas Chinese and Asian people again. Its sinister actions will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat under the heavy blows of our overseas Chinese and the people of Asian countries. Li Dequan, president of the Red Cross Society of China, and Pu Huar, a representative of the China People's Relief Administration, were also invited to speak. Li Dequan exposed the various atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism in driving its lackeys to intensify the persecution of our overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. She said: We must never tolerate the endless persecution of our overseas Chinese by imperialism. We, the Red Cross Society of China, standing on humanitarian grounds, will send a fact-finding mission to Malaya and other places to investigate all the circumstances of our overseas Chinese being oppressed and ravaged. Her proposal was warmly supported by the audience and unanimously adopted. Pu Huar said in his speech: The China Relief Administration will cooperate with the Red Cross Society to organize the fact-finding mission and hopes that overseas and returned refugees will list the circumstances of their persecution and devastation and report them to the China People's Relief Administration. Overseas Chinese worker representative Lu Cheng, women representative Wu Ruiying, and student representative Xie Jiawu spoke in succession. They made painful accusations to the congress about the various hardships they had personally suffered. They angrily stated: The Japanese imperialists owe overseas Chinese countless blood debts that have not yet been repaid. Today, U.S. imperialism wants to arm Japan in an attempt to re-enslave the people of Asia and overseas Chinese. Our more than ten million overseas Chinese must not tolerate this heinous act of aggression. We must closely unite with the people of the whole country, the people of all Asia, and the people of the whole world to completely smash all the conspiracies of the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism. The congress finally passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, a telegram to the World Peace Council, a telegram of condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, a telegram of condolences to overseas Chinese, and a declaration of the congress, and adopted the Patriotic Pact of Returned Overseas Chinese.
　　
　　A demonstration parade was held after the meeting. The parade carried huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Marshal Stalin, General Kim Il-sung, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, leaders of various countries' people. Many returned Nanyang overseas Chinese students wore national costumes from Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Siam, and Indonesia to participate in the parade.

Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

　　Thanks to your wise leadership, the Chinese people have been able to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its master, imperialism, in China and establish their own country. In just over a year since liberation, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful fortress guarding Asian and world peace, giving overseas Chinese a strong backing in their united struggle to defend their legitimate rights; the lives of overseas Chinese families in China have also gained unprecedented stability and security. We would like to express our sincere support and deepest gratitude to you.

　　Since the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Taiwan and Korea, the returned overseas Chinese in Beijing have enthusiastically participated in the sacred movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country with the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. Today is the day of the world's people's heroic struggle against the imperialist colonial system. We and the returned overseas Chinese in various parts of the country simultaneously held a demonstration parade against the U.S. arming of Japan, unanimously adopted the Patriotic Pact of Returned Overseas Chinese, and guaranteed its thorough implementation. The congress unanimously expressed its determination to fight to the end against the U.S. imperialist war of aggression and to defend world peace! We offer you our highest respect!

Declaration of the Congress

　　In the war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism has suffered a decisive defeat under the heroic resistance of the powerful Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. After completely exposing the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of its paper tiger, U.S. imperialists sent the notorious war peddler Dulles to Japan and Southeast Asia to carry out conspiracies, vainly attempting to make a separate peace with Japan and further arm Japan to revive Japanese militarism, making it serve as a new tool for U.S. imperialism in Asia, in order to save its dying fate. This completely violates and destroys international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement. The people of the whole country and overseas Chinese in various places, as well as peace-loving people of the world, are extremely angry and firmly oppose this evil conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists.

　　For many years, overseas Chinese have suffered under the rule, ravages, and oppression of imperialism. During the three years and eight months of the Japanese imperialist occupation of Southeast Asia in World War II, overseas Chinese and local people alike suffered from the brutal massacres, ravages, and persecutions of the Japanese invaders. Under the brutal massacres of the Japanese invaders, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives in Singapore alone; more than ten thousand workers were abused, tortured, and killed innocently when the Japanese invaders forced the construction of the Siam-Burma "Death Railway" at that time; and in Java, Sumatra, the Philippines, and other places, overseas Chinese were collectively arrested and imprisoned, and the collective or sporadic massacres by the Japanese invaders were even more impossible to count. Overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia, together with the people of all ethnic groups, with long-term struggles and extremely significant sacrifices, cooperated with the victory of the people of the world's anti-fascist camp to defeat the heinous enemy of Japanese imperialism. Now the people of the motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great and wise leader Chairman Mao, have expelled imperialism, overthrown the reactionary rule of the Chiang bandit gang, and established their own country, the People's Republic of China. In just over a year, it has achieved leap-forward progress, especially the great victory achieved by our people in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, making our motherland a powerful fortress guarding Asian peace and world peace, and giving overseas Chinese a strong backing in their united struggle to defend their legitimate rights. The lives of overseas Chinese families in China have also gained unprecedented stability and security. Therefore, we must never tolerate the U.S. rearming of Japan, the revival of Japan's aggressive forces, and the continued harm to our motherland's people and the people of Southeast Asian countries.

　　We, the returned overseas Chinese in Beijing, in order to completely smash the U.S. imperialists' aggressive conspiracy, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's repeated statements on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, firmly support Marshal Stalin's recently published remarks, and vow to do everything in our power to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to oppose the U.S. imperialists' unilateral peace treaty with Japan for rearming Japan, and to fight to the end to defend Asian and world peace!

Telegram of Condolences to the Chinese and Korean People's Armed Forces
　　
　　To all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:
　　First of all, let us offer our condolences to you for your hard work in fighting heroically against the invading troops of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in defending our motherland and maintaining world peace. Today, we, the returned overseas Chinese in Beijing and in various parts of the country, are holding demonstration parades simultaneously, and, along with the people of the whole country, we express our extreme indignation and firm opposition to the imperialists, headed by the United States, who are conspiring to arm Japan and expand the war of aggression.

　　We overseas Chinese have suffered from ravages and oppression in imperialist colonies for many years. During the three years and eight months of the Japanese fascist occupation of Southeast Asia in World War II, we suffered even more from the brutal massacres and persecutions of the Japanese invaders. Especially after U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Taiwan and Korea, overseas Chinese everywhere were subjected to arrest, detention, massacre, and large-scale expulsion by the imperialists.

　　Now we have returned to the embrace of the new and lovable motherland and have received warm care. We have personally seen the thriving and completely new appearance of our motherland and its beautiful future. Therefore, our beliefs have become more firm, our love for our motherland has deepened, and our courage to defend this lovable country at any cost and to shed our last drop of blood when necessary to defend our country has been strengthened.

　　Comrades: Because of your heroic fighting, U.S. imperialism has suffered a decisive defeat. This has made us deeply aware of the greatness and strength of the people of China and Korea. We vow to do everything in our power to support you and resolutely drive the barbaric and brutal U.S. aggressors out of Korean territory. We extend to you
　　our highest respect.

Telegram to Overseas Compatriots

Dear Overseas Compatriots:

　　We, the returned overseas Chinese in Beijing and the returned overseas Chinese in various parts of the country, today—the day of the heroic struggle of the world's people against the imperialist colonial system—are holding demonstration parades in various places simultaneously to oppose the U.S. arming of Japan. All of us returned overseas Chinese would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to our compatriots who remain overseas.

　　Our overseas Chinese have suffered from the ravages and oppression of the imperialists over the years. After the U.S. launched the war of aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army heroically resisted the U.S. and its accomplice troops on the Korean battlefield and achieved a decisive victory. The future of our motherland is infinitely bright. However, the situation of overseas compatriots is becoming more and more serious. Compatriots in various places have been successively arrested, imprisoned, murdered, and deported by local reactionary governments. Schools and newspaper offices have been shut down, and a large number of compatriots have been separated from their wives and children, bankrupted, and fallen into starvation and destitution.

　　Compatriots: This fascist bloody atrocity of the imperialists has long aroused great anger and hatred among our compatriots in our motherland. We are infinitely concerned about the thousands of compatriots who are directly or indirectly under the rule of the imperialists far away overseas. We resolutely support your struggle to defend your legitimate rights.

　　Compatriots: Our great motherland, under the leadership of the wise leader Chairman Mao, has gained independence, freedom, and prosperity, and has become a powerful fortress guarding Asian and world peace. However, the U.S. imperialists are unwilling to give up, and they are determined to be enemies with the Chinese people; to be enemies with the people of all Asia and the world. After suffering a decisive defeat on the Korean battlefield, the U.S. did not accept the due lesson, but instead intensified its conspiracy to arm Japan and expand the war of aggression.

　　Compatriots: The towering crimes of the Japanese fascists in Southeast Asia in the past are unforgettable for our overseas Chinese. We must never tolerate the revival of Japan's aggressive forces to continue to harm our motherland and the people of Asia. We insist on liberating Taiwan and smashing all the aggressive conspiracies of the U.S.

　　Compatriots: We "must not wait for peace, we must strive for peace." Our overseas Chinese must strengthen their unity and cooperate more closely with the people of all oppressed nations to defend their legitimate rights. We have full confidence and strength to smash all the aggressive plans of U.S. imperialism and defend Asian and world peace!

　　We wish you good health!

  向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    由于您的英明领导，使中国人民得以推翻蒋介石匪帮及其主子帝国主义在中国的反动统治，建立人民自己的国家。在解放以后不过一年多的时间内，中华人民共和国已经成为拱卫亚洲和世界和平的强大堡垒，使华侨在为保卫自己正当权益的团结斗争中，有了强有力的后盾；国内侨眷的生活也获得了空前的安定和保障。我们谨向您表示忠诚的拥戴和最深厚的感谢。
    自从美帝国主义者发动对台湾、朝鲜的侵略战争以来，我们在北京的归国华侨就以爱国主义和国际主义的精神，热烈地参加到抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣运动中。今天是世界人民反对帝国主义殖民制度英勇斗争日。我们和全国各地归国华侨同时举行反对美国武装日本示威游行大会，一致通过了归国华侨爱国公约，并保证其彻底实行。大会一致表示，坚决为反对美帝国主义侵略战争，保卫世界和平而斗争到底！谨向您致最崇高的敬礼！

          一九五一年二月二十一日
  大会宣言
    美国帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中，在强大的朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军的英勇抗击之下，已遭受了决定性的失败。在完全暴露了它纸老虎的外强中干的原形以后，美国帝国主义者又派臭名远扬的战争贩子杜勒斯到日本和东南亚各地进行阴谋活动，妄图片面对日媾和，进一步武装日本，复活日本的军国主义，使之充当美帝国主义在亚洲的新的侵略工具，以挽救它的垂死命运。这完全违反和破坏了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和雅尔塔协定等国际协议。全国人民和各地华侨以及世界爱好和平的人民万分愤怒，坚决反对美国帝国主义者这一罪恶阴谋。
    华侨多少年来在帝国主义的统治摧残和压迫下，在第二次大战日本帝国主义占领东南亚的三年零八个月的时期中，华侨和当地人民同时还遭受到了日寇的残酷屠杀摧残与迫害。在日寇的残酷屠杀下，华侨在新加坡就牺牲了数以万计的生命；在当时日寇强迫修筑暹缅“死亡铁路”时被摧残虐杀、无辜而死的工人亦达万人以上；而在爪哇、苏岛、菲律宾等处的华侨集体被捕入狱，被日寇集体或零星屠杀的，更无法统计。东南亚各地华侨，和当地各族人民一道，以长期的斗争和极重大的牺牲，配合世界反法西斯阵营人民的胜利，才得以打倒了日本帝国主义这个万恶的敌人。现在祖国人民在中国共产党和伟大英明领袖毛主席领导下，驱逐了帝国主义，推翻了蒋匪帮的反动统治，建立了人民自己的国家——中华人民共和国，仅仅在一年多的时间，已获得了飞跃的进步，特别是我国人民在抗美援朝中所取得的伟大胜利，使我们祖国成为拱卫亚洲和平、世界和平的强大堡垒，使海外华侨在为保卫自己正当权益的团结斗争中有了强有力的后盾，国内侨眷的生活也获得了空前的安定和保障。因此我们决不能容忍美国重新武装日本、复活日本的侵略势力、继续危害我们祖国人民和东南亚各国人民。
    我们北京归国华侨，为了彻底粉碎美国帝国主义的侵略阴谋，坚决拥护周外长关于对日和约问题的历次声明，坚决拥护斯大林大元帅最近所发表的谈话，誓尽一切力量，为抗美援朝，为反对美国帝国主义者重新武装日本片面对日媾和，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗到底！
          北京归国华侨反对美国武装日本示威游行大会
            一九五一年二月二十一日
  致中朝人民部队慰问电朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军全体指战员同志们：
    首先让我们慰问你们为保卫祖国、维护世界和平在对美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略军队英勇战斗的辛劳。今天我们在北京和全国各地的归国华侨同时举行示威游行大会，和全国人民一致，对以美国为首的帝国主义者阴谋武装日本、扩大侵略战争表示极度的愤恨与坚决反对。
    我们华侨，多年以来在帝国主义殖民地内遭受了蹂躏与压迫，在第二次大战日本法西斯占领东南亚的三年零八个月的时期，更遭受日寇的残酷屠杀和迫害。特别在美帝发动对台湾、朝鲜的侵略战争以后，海外华侨到处遭受帝国主义者逮捕、拘禁、屠杀和大规模的驱逐。
    现在我们回到新生的可爱的祖国怀抱，得到热烈的关怀。我们亲眼看到了祖国欣欣向荣的焕然一新和他的美满的前途，因此更加坚定了我们的信念，更加深了我们对祖国的热爱，更加强了我们不惜任何牺牲来保卫这可爱的国家和必要时不惜流尽我们最后一滴血来保卫我们国家的勇气。
    同志们：由于你们英勇战斗，已使美帝遭受了决定性的失败。这更使我们深深认识到中朝两国人民力量的伟大坚强。我们誓尽一切力量支援你们，坚决要把野蛮残暴的美国侵略军驱逐出朝鲜土地。敬向你们致
    崇高的敬礼
      北京归国华侨反对美国武装日本示威游行大会
            一九五一年二月二十一日
  致海外侨胞电亲爱的海外侨胞们：
    我们北京归国华侨和全国各地归国华侨，今天——世界人民反对帝国主义殖民制度的英勇斗争日——在各地同时举行反对美国武装日本示威游行大会。我们全体归侨特向留在海外的侨胞们致亲切的慰问。
    我们海外华侨，历年来遭受帝国主义者摧残与压迫。在美帝发动对朝鲜与我国台湾的侵略战争以后，中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上英勇的抗击美帝及其帮凶军队，取得了决定性的胜利。祖国前途是无限光明的。可是海外侨胞的处境却更趋严重。各地的侨胞接连的被当地反动政府逮捕、囚禁、杀害和驱逐出境，学校、报馆被查封，广大侨胞妻离子散、倾家荡产、陷于饥寒交迫的境地。
    侨胞们：帝国主义者这种法西斯血腥暴行，久已引起祖国同胞的极大愤怒和仇恨。我们对于远处海外直接间接在帝国主义者统治下的千余万同胞是无限关怀的。我们坚决支援你们为保卫自己正当权益而进行的斗争。
    侨胞们：我们伟大的祖国在英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，已经获得独立自由繁荣，并且成为拱卫亚洲与世界和平的强大堡垒。但是，美帝国主义者是死不甘心的，它决心要和中国人民为敌；要和全亚洲全世界人民为敌，美帝在朝鲜战场遭到决定性的失败后，它不接受应得的教训，反而变本加厉地阴谋武装日本，扩大侵略战争。
    侨胞们：过去日本法西斯在东南亚的滔天罪行是我们华侨所没齿不忘的，我们决不能容忍日本侵略势力的复活，继续来危害祖国和亚洲的人民。我们坚持解放台湾，粉碎美帝的一切侵略阴谋。
    侨胞们：我们“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平。”我们海外华侨要加强自己的团结，要和各被压迫民族的人民更亲密的合作，来保卫自己的正当权益。我们完全有信心，有力量粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略计划，保卫亚洲与世界和平！
    祝你们健康！
