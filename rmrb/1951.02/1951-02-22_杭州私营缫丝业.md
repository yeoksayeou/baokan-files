　　Hangzhou's Private Silk Reeling Industry
　　Nai Qiu, Ting Fang, Shi Lin
　　Hangzhou's silk reeling industry is one of China's famous light industries. After liberation, it has gradually recovered production under the strong support of the People's Government. As of now, eight private silk reeling factories have started operations in Hangzhou, employing more than 2,800 workers, operating 758 vertical silk reeling machines, and 524 seated silk reeling machines.

　　In the first half of last year, when various industries were facing difficulties due to the blockade and bombing by the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the state-owned China Silk Company immediately supported the city's silk reeling industry by providing a large amount of raw materials for processing. However, because the raw materials were cocoon stocks from 1949 and of poor quality, the factories, in order to secure processing fees to solve capital turnover problems, focused on quantity rather than quality, resulting in silk grades mostly below C. After July, the China Silk Company revised the commissioned reeling method, with clear regulations on the quantity and quality of products, particularly requiring factories to improve grades to suit export. Afterwards, the raw materials allocated to the factories were newly harvested fresh cocoons of better quality. Consequently, the factories began to pay attention to the quality of the products. With the cooperative efforts of both labor and management, the factories successively made improvements in machinery and operating techniques. For example, Kaiyuan Silk Reeling Factory was the first to convert the original 20 seated silk reeling machines into 16 revolving vertical silk reeling machines, and also added 24 cocoon sorting machines. Huaxin No. 3 Factory added ammonia equipment to the cocoon cooking machines to strengthen the penetration efficiency. Other factories successively transformed backward seated silk reeling machines into new vertical silk reeling machines, thereby greatly improving machine efficiency. Workers also continuously improved their operating methods, changing cocoon cooking to low-temperature, long-time methods, processing raw materials precisely and meticulously, no longer as rough as in the past. Attention was also paid to the fixed grain size and thickness adjustment of the cocoons. As a result, 83% of the silk produced in the second half of the year met export specifications, a significant improvement compared to the 40% unqualified rate in 1949. In terms of output, the average daily output per vertical silk reeling machine last year was 25 taels, an increase of 25% compared to 1949. The total output for the whole year was about 40 dan.

　　Because of the state's processing support and stable production, labor-management relations in the silk reeling industry were generally more harmonious last year. Labor-management consultation meetings have been successively established in each factory throughout the year, and all disputes have been readily resolved on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and voluntariness. Due to the improvement of workers' political awareness, four of the eight silk reeling factories also launched a vigorous production competition movement in the second half of last year, achieving considerable results. In the production competition, the product quality of Kaiyuan Factory was upgraded from grade B to grade A, and the average output increased from 29 taels to 30.3 taels. The trade union also led the workers to focus on production with all their strength, ensuring the completion of the factory's production plan. However, in terms of management systems, although the autocratic and high-handed management methods that used to stand on the heads of workers have been abolished, democratic management systems have not yet been universally established. The old factory rules have been abolished, and new rules and regulations have not yet been largely established. The wage system and reward and punishment methods are also not reasonable enough, generally still using the outdated method of calculating wages based on the average output per period, with increases or decreases in proportion to the wage for exceeding or failing to meet the target, which creates instability in workers' production mood. If the quality of raw materials is good, the workers' production mood is high, and vice versa, so it urgently needs to be improved.

　　In addition, because each factory has not yet established an economic accounting system last year, cost calculations are not accurate enough, but the increase in product quantity and quality has relatively reduced costs. Last year, only individual factories suffered losses due to small capital, bearing higher interest, and poor production and unreasonable management. In order to lay the foundation for the implementation of economic accounting systems of fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed materials, fixed quality, and fixed quantity, from August last year, the factories jointly designed a unified accounting system, formulated unified account books and charts, and determined the cost valuation of each product. This new accounting system has been implemented since New Year's Day this year.

　　In general, the Hangzhou silk reeling industry has made great progress in production transformation in the past year under the guidance of the government, the support of the state-owned China Silk Company, and the workers' initiative and unity. However, it cannot be denied that there are still many shortcomings, especially that the determination of individual capitalists to transform is not enough, and they are not willing to invest more effort in management, and have a strong dependence mentality, lacking the idea of self-reliance. For example, Huaxin No. 3 Factory and Huaxin Xieji Silk Factory, etc., the government has repeatedly instructed to increase capital, but the factory does not work hard to find ways, but blindly uses loans to turn around funds, so the machinery and equipment are not enough. When autumn cocoons were on the market last year, five silk reeling factories responded to the government's call to purchase and reel themselves, and generally achieved profits, indicating that self-reliance is beneficial. In 1951, efforts should be made in this direction.

　　杭州私营缫丝业
    耐秋  庭芳  士林
    杭州的缫丝业是我国著名的轻工业之一，解放后在人民政府大力扶助下已逐渐恢复生产。到目前止，杭市已开工的私营缫丝厂已达八家，职工二千八百余人，转动立缫车七五八台，座缫车五二四台。
    去年上半年正当各业处于美蒋匪帮封锁、轰炸的困难时，国营中国蚕丝公司随即以大量原料用加工办法扶助该市缫丝业生产，但因原料是一九四九年的存茧，品质较差，各厂为争取工缴以解决资金周转，都偏重产量而不顾品质，所产生丝品位多在Ｃ级以下。七月以后，中蚕公司修改了委托代缫办法，对产品的量与质有了明确的规定。特别要求各厂提高品位以期适合外销。以后拨给各厂的原料都是新收的新茧，品质较优。由此各厂才注重了产品的品位。靠着劳资双方的协力合作，各厂相继在机器设备与操作技术上作了改进。例如开沅缫丝厂就首先把原有的二十台座缫车改装成十六台周转式的立缫车，还增设了二四台扬返车；华新三厂则将煮茧机增置了阿母尼亚设备，加强了渗透效能；其余各厂纷纷把落后的座缫车改造成新式的立缫车，因此机器效能大大提高。工人们在操作方法上也不断改良，煮茧改为低温长时间，处理原料精确细致，不再像过去那样粗糙。并注意了茧的定粒和厚薄的调配。这样，下半年所产生丝就有百分之八三合于出口规格，比一九四九年所产百分之四十不合格的状况有了显著的进步。在产量上，去年平均每车立缫车日产二十五关两，也比一九四九年提高达百分之二十五；去年全年产量共约四十关担。
    因为国家的加工扶植、生产稳定，去年缫丝业在劳资关系上一般地比较协调。各厂劳资协商会议一年中已先后建立，在平等、两利、自愿的基础上，所有争议也就迎刃而解。由于工人政治觉悟的提高，去年下半年八个缫丝厂中有四个厂还轰轰烈烈地开展了生产竞赛运动，收到了相当大的成绩。开沅厂在生产竞赛中，产品质量，由Ｂ级升到Ａ级，平均产量由二九关两提高到三○·三关两。工会并领导工人全力面向生产，保证了厂方生产计划的完成。但各厂在管理制度上，虽已废除了过去站在工人头上的专制高压的管理方式，民主管理制度却还不曾普遍建立，旧的厂规已废除，新的规章也大都未订立。在工资制度与奖惩办法上也不够合理，一般还沿用陈旧的以每期平均产量的方法计算工资，超过的、不够的均按工资比例增减，这就造成工人生产情绪的不安定，如若原料品质好，工人生产情绪就高，反之则低，所以亟待改进。
    另外，因为去年各厂尚未建立经济核算制，成本计算都不够精确，但产品数量与品位的提高，也相对地减低了成本。去年只有个别厂因资金少，负担了较大利息，并因生产差、经营不合理而有亏损。为了给实施定员、定时、定料、定质、定量的经济核算制打下基础，去年八月起各厂联合设计出了统一的会计制度，制订了统一的帐册和图表，确定了每一产品的成本估价。这个新的会计制度已在今年元旦起开始实行。
    总的说来，杭市缫丝业一年来在政府指导，国营中蚕公司扶助以及工人的主动团结下，在生产改造上是有很大进步的。但不可否认仍存在不少缺点，特别是个别资本家改造的决心还不够，还不肯投入更大的力量经营，并有浓厚的依赖心理，缺乏自力更生的思想。如华新第三厂及华新协记等丝厂，政府一再指示增加资金，但厂方并不努力设法，却一味以借贷周转资金，因而机器设备也不够。去年秋茧上市时，有五家缫丝厂响应政府号召收购自缫，结果普遍获得盈余，说明自力更生是有利的，一九五一年应向这个方向努力。
