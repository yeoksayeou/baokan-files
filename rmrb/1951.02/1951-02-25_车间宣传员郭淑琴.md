Workshop Propagandist Guo Shuqin

　　Guo Shuqin, a female worker at the Harbin Woolen Mill, is one of the factory's outstanding workshop propagandists.

　　In the autumn of 1950, the flames of American imperialism's aggression in Korea reached the borders of our motherland, and the call to resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country stirred the people of the entire nation. At this time, the Party organization gave Guo Shuqin a task: to carry out patriotic propaganda and mobilization work in the workshop to welcome the production competition. Guo Shuqin understood that propagandists are indispensable assistants to the Party organization on the production front. She said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I will do everything in my power to complete the glorious task given to me by the Party."

　　At that time, the workers in the workshop still had a vague understanding of the situation. Some said, "Resisting America and aiding Korea has nothing to do with the workers. Isn't production what workers always do?!" Guo Shuqin's propaganda team studied this situation and set up a "Question and Answer Column" in the workshop to urge and encourage everyone to study current affairs and production. Once, a female worker, Fu Yuzhen, was asked to answer a question, but she couldn't. From then on, Fu Yuzhen read newspapers, studied books, and sought out others to discuss problems every night, often studying until eight or nine o'clock. At the same time, she also advised others: "You must study hard. Look, it's so embarrassing to be ignorant!" Many workers also felt that their studies were insufficient, so Guo Shuqin's propaganda team seized the opportunity to form a reading group. They used the time before work or during the lunch break to read newspapers and guide everyone to discuss them in connection with workshop production. Once, they read an article in the Northeast Daily describing the atrocities of the American imperialist aggressor army in killing the Korean people. Everyone angrily roared, and worker Cao Rucheng cursed, "These beasts even killed babies! They have no humanity at all!" Some said, "We can't go to the front to kill the enemy, but doing a good job in production is also like winning a battle." In the end, everyone unanimously expressed, "We must step up production to increase national defense strength and respond to the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism."

　　Last November, the factory launched a patriotic production competition. Guo Shuqin was not only a propagandist and mobilizer of the competition but also an active organizer of the competition. Guo Shuqin repeatedly explained the significance of carrying out the patriotic production competition to the workers, arousing their production enthusiasm. She often said, "The American devils are bullying Korea. If we don't defeat them, they will bully us in the future. Then we won't be able to live in peace. Now, carrying out the patriotic production competition is to increase national defense strength and defeat American imperialism's aggression." Guo Shuqin also used her selfless and exemplary actions to motivate everyone. She first challenged all the workers in the workshop. As a result, the entire workshop, group by group, and worker by worker, was drawn into the upsurge of the production competition.

　　After the production competition began, the administration announced new production quotas. The workshop stipulated that two people should sort six woolen blankets a day. At this time, Guo Shuqin found that the old operating methods had become an obstacle to promoting the new quotas. For example, in the trimming group, two people looking at one case were prone to mutual dependence, which affected the enthusiasm for production. Therefore, she proposed at the workshop production meeting that the trimming group should be changed to one person looking at one case, and the new quota of six woolen blankets per day for two people should be changed to three woolen blankets per day per person. However, after the workers heard this, many people couldn't understand it, thinking, "Fewer people, higher output, it's impossible to reach the quota." They lacked confidence in the new operating method. Guo Shuqin patiently talked with the workers. She said, "If we can't reach the new quota, how can the production task be completed? Although we are not used to the new operating method now, we will get used to it in a few days. Can't we overcome this difficulty? If we compare ourselves to the volunteers at the front line in Korea, wouldn't that be too shameful?!" Everyone was moved by her words and said, "Let's give it a try." Soon, Tang Shuhua and Ju Xiulan both achieved an output of six woolen blankets per person per day, exceeding the new quota by 100%. Guo Shuqin immediately wrote this on the blackboard newspaper and used the facts to illustrate at the workshop production meeting, "The new operating method can be implemented, and the new quota can be achieved." The workers' enthusiasm for production increased, and production efficiency also rapidly improved. By the end of last December, the average daily output per person in the trimming group had reached four and a half blankets. The edging group also increased from 300 blankets per day for two people in the past to 850 blankets.

　　The packaging group lacked even more confidence in implementing the new quotas than other groups. Guo Shuqin then encouraged Liu Yumin, an activist in the group, to change the operating method, telling him that when lifting the turf, everyone should not stop the machine to lift it together. They could take shifts to watch the machine and lift the turf so that the machine would not stop for a minute, and the output would increase. Liu Yumin accepted her suggestion and confidently brewed it among the workers. At that time, there were five people in the packaging group, so they were divided into two shifts: three male workers in one shift and two female workers in one shift. The female workers were short and had little strength, so the male workers often ridiculed them for "not being of much use!" The female workers themselves were also afraid that they "couldn't do it." Guo Shuqin said to them, "Don't look down on yourselves. We must do something to show them." The two female workers were encouraged by her and aroused their enthusiasm for production. In twenty-four hours, they completed twenty-eight packages, which was equivalent to the output of five male workers in fifty hours. The propaganda team immediately wrote this new record on the blackboard newspaper for commendation. Later, the three female workers created a new record of packing forty-five packages in thirty hours.

　　In the wet finishing workshop, an average of more than twenty accidents occurred every month in the past. After the production competition started, the work became tense, and Guo Shuqin was worried that even more accidents would occur. She led the propaganda team to make an accident comparison chart and hang it in the workshop, with the words written next to it: "Workers: You have seen the defective products, pay attention next time!" Since then, there has not been a single accident in the workshop. In the dry finishing workshop, the attendance rate was also not good, so Guo Shuqin's propaganda team made an attendance comparison chart to encourage everyone. Since the chart was posted, the red line representing attendance rose day by day, eventually reaching the point where no one in the entire workshop was absent. In order to promote the patriotic production competition to continue to move forward, Guo Shuqin suggested to the workshop union to launch a red flag competition to encourage the entire workshop to continue to upsurge in production.

　　At the end-of-year production summary and award ceremony in 1950, eighteen of the nineteen workers in Guo Shuqin's workshop were named models, winning the honorary title of model workshop in the entire factory.

　　车间宣传员郭淑琴
    商恺
    哈尔滨毛织厂的女工郭淑琴，是该厂优秀的车间宣传员之一。
    一九五○年秋天，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的火焰，烧到了祖国的边疆，抗美援朝保家卫国的声浪，激荡着全国人民。这时，党组织给了郭淑琴一个任务——开展车间爱国主义宣传鼓动工作，以迎接生产竞赛。郭淑琴懂得：宣传员，是党组织在生产战线上不可缺少的助手。她说：“我是一个共产党员，我要尽一切力量，去完成党所给我的光荣任务。”
    当时车间的工友们，对形势的认识还很模糊，有的说：“抗美援朝和工人没有关系，工人什么时候还不是生产？！”郭淑琴宣传小组，研究了这种情况，在车间设置了“问答栏”，来督促和鼓励大家对于时事与生产方面的学习。有一次，女工符玉珍被指名答复一个问题，符玉珍没有答上来。从此，符玉珍每天晚上都要读报、看书、找人研究问题，常常学习到八九点钟。同时她还劝说别人：“可得要好好学习，你看，一问三不知多么难为情啊！”许多工友也都感到了自己学习不够，郭淑琴宣传小组便抓紧时机，成立了读报组。每天利用上班以前，或中午休息时间读报，并引导大家联系车间生产来进行讨论。有一次她们读到东北日报上一篇叙述美帝国主义的侵略军残杀朝鲜人民的通讯。大家都气愤地咆哮起来，工友曹汝成骂道：“这帮子野兽，连吃奶的孩子都杀了，真没一点人性！”有的说：“咱们不能到前方去杀敌，搞好生产，也等于打了胜仗。”最后大家一致表示：“要加紧生产增加国防力量，回答美帝国主义的侵略暴行。”
    去年十一月，全厂开展爱国主义生产竞赛。郭淑琴不仅是竞赛的宣传鼓动者，而且是竞赛的积极组织者。郭淑琴反复地向工友们解释着开展爱国主义生产竞赛的意义，鼓动工友们的生产情绪。她常说：“美国鬼子正在欺侮朝鲜，要不打垮它，将来就会欺侮到咱们的头上，到那时咱的太平日子就过不成了。现在开展爱国主义生产竞赛，就是为了增加国防力量，打败美国鬼子的侵略。”郭淑琴并用奋不顾身的模范行动去带动大家，她首先向全车间的工友提出挑战。于是全车间小组与小组、工友与工友都卷入了生产竞赛的热潮。
    生产竞赛展开之后，行政上公布了新的生产定额，整理车间规定两人每天整理毛毯六匹。这时，郭淑琴发现旧的操作方法已成为推行新定额的障碍，如修剪组两个人看一个案子，容易互相依赖，影响生产积极性的发挥。于是她在车间生产会议上提议：修剪组应改为一个人看一个案子，并按新定额两人每天出毛毯六匹，改为每人每天出毛毯三匹。但工友们听到后，很多人思想搞不通，认为：“人少，产量高，无法达到定额。”对新的操作方法更缺乏信心。郭淑琴耐心地和工友们进行谈话。她说：“如果咱们不能达到新定额，生产任务怎能完成呢？新的操作方法，现在虽然不习惯，过几天熟悉了就好了；这点困难我们还不能克服，要是和在朝鲜前线的志愿军比起来，不太不像话了吗？！”大家为她的话所感动，都说“试试看吧。”不久，唐淑华、鞠秀兰二人的产量都达到了每人每天出毛毯六匹，超过新定额一倍。郭淑琴立刻将这件事情写在黑板报上，并在车间生产会议上，用事实说明：“新的操作方法是可以实行的，新的定额是可以实现的。”工友们生产热情提高了，生产效率也迅速地提高了。到去年十二月底，修剪组每人每天平均产量已达到四匹半。锁边组也由过去的每天二人出毛毯三百条，增加到八百五十条。
    打包组在贯彻新定额中，比别组更缺乏信心。郭淑琴便鼓动该组积极分子刘玉民改变操作方法，告诉他抬草皮时，不要停下机器大家都去抬，可以分班轮流看机器、抬草皮，使机器一分钟也不停，产量就会提高。刘玉民接受了她的意见，很有信心地在工友中间进行酝酿。当时打包组共五个人，遂分成两班：三个男工一班，两个女工一班。女工身量低，力气小，因此男工常常讥笑她们“不顶啥用！”女工自己也怕“干不了”。郭淑琴对她们说：“不要看不起自己，咱们要干出个样子来让他们看看。”两个女工受到了她的鼓励，激发起生产热情，在二十四个小时内，便完成了二十八包；等于过去五个男工，五十个小时的产量。宣传小组立刻将这一新的纪录，写在黑板报上，进行表扬。后来三个女工又在三十个小时内，创造了打四十五包的新纪录。
    湿整车间，过去平均每月要发生二十多次事故。生产竞赛开始后，工作紧张了，郭淑琴担心事故会出的更多。她就领导宣传组制作了一个事故比较表挂在车间里，旁边写着：“工友：你看出残品了，下次注意吧！”从此该车间再没有发生一次事故。干整车间，出勤率也不好，郭淑琴宣传组便又制了一个出勤缺勤比较表，来勉励大家。自从这个表贴出以后，表上代表出勤的红线天天往上升，最后达到全车间没有一个人缺勤。为了推动爱国主义生产竞赛继续前进，郭淑琴又建议车间工会，发动了红旗竞赛，鼓舞全车间生产热潮继续高涨。
    一九五○年年终，全厂生产总结评奖大会上，郭淑琴车间十九名工友，有十八名工友被评为模范，获得了全厂模范车间的光荣称号。
