　　Spokesperson of the China Peace Committee Against American Aggression Issues Statement:
    Responding to Stalin's Call to Defend Peace
    Mobilizing Everyone in the Country to Participate in the Movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Oppose the Arming of Japan
    [Our Newspaper] The spokesperson for the China People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression issued a statement regarding Marshal Stalin's answers to questions posed by a Pravda reporter, saying:
    At this tense moment in the struggle between the forces of peace and war, the statement issued on the 16th by Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world, is of great significance. Stalin strongly condemned the shameful slander of the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by the aggressive forces of the US and Britain, in passing a resolution "condemning the People's Republic of China as an aggressor," and asserted that the Korean War would inevitably end in the failure of the US and British aggressors. This is a tremendous encouragement to the Chinese people.
    Stalin called on the people of all countries to take up the cause of defending peace and to defend this cause to the end, in order to maintain and consolidate peace. He also pointed out: "A broad movement to defend peace, as a tool to expose the evil schemes of the warmongers, is now of the utmost importance." Stalin's instructions are the guiding light for the people of the world today.
    We call on all the people of China to widely study Marshal Stalin's statement, to recognize the future of the Chinese and Korean people's resistance against American aggression as inevitably leading to complete victory, to recognize the importance of consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship and uniting the strength of the people of the world, and to mobilize everyone in the country to actively participate in the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the arming of Japan, and to carry the cause of defending peace to the end.

　　我国保卫和平反美侵略委员会发言人发表谈话
    响应斯大林维护和平的号召
    动员全国每一个人都参加抗美援朝反对武装日本运动
    【本报讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会发言人就斯大林大元帅对真理报记者所提问题的答复发表谈话说：
    当此和平和战争两种力量斗争的紧张关头，全世界劳动人民的伟大导师斯大林大元帅十六日所发表的谈话，有着极大的意义。斯大林痛斥了联合国大会在美英侵略势力操纵下通过的“谴责中华人民共和国为侵略者”的可耻诽谤，并断言朝鲜战争必将以美英侵略者的失败而告终。这对于中国人民是莫大的鼓舞。
    斯大林号召世界各国的人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，以便保持和巩固和平。他并且指出：“广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”斯大林的这些指示，是全世界人民当前的引路明灯。
    我们号召全中国人民广泛地学习斯大林大元帅的这个谈话，认识中朝人民反抗美国侵略必然取得完全胜利的前途，认识巩固中苏友谊和团结全世界人民力量的重要性，并且动员全国每一个人都积极参加抗美援朝反对武装日本的斗争，把保卫和平的事业进行到底。
