　　The Postal and Telecommunications Department Should Not Limit Recruitment of Staff to Children of Postal and Telecommunications Employees

　　To the Editor:

　　The Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recruited a batch of telephone operators two months ago, and recently the post office is also recruiting postmen and clerks, but all are limited to direct relatives supported by postal and telecommunications employees who are eligible to apply. I feel that this is unfair and detrimental to the work. Because it makes everyone feel that postal and telecommunications are not enterprises of the general public, but enterprises of postal and telecommunications employees. Moreover, by rejecting the applications of many outstanding young people who are willing to serve the postal and telecommunications industry but are not direct relatives of postal and telecommunications employees, the level of recruitment is reduced invisibly. Taking the telephone operators recruited by the Telecommunications Bureau last time as an example, if non-employee family members were allowed to apply, and selections were made from a larger number of applicants, the business qualifications of those recruited would definitely be much higher. In this way, it is beneficial to improving the level of the entire postal and telecommunications staff.

　　The explanation given by some responsible cadres for this method is: to take care of some employees with difficult family lives and provide job opportunities for their families. I think this is also wrong. Because employees with difficult families do not necessarily have family members who meet the conditions for application, and those who meet the conditions for application may not necessarily pass the exam. Therefore, the number of people who can solve family difficulties through this method is probably too small. I think that taking care of employees with particularly difficult families should only be done by giving them priority in recruitment during public recruitment. Such methods with guild tendencies should not be allowed to develop.

　　I don’t know if my opinion is correct. I hope it can be published for the reference of relevant departments.

### 邮电部门招考工作人员不应只限于邮电职工子弟

　　邮电部门招考工作人员
　  不应只限于邮电职工子弟
    编辑同志：
    邮电部电信总局在两个月前，招考了一批话务员，最近邮局又在招考邮递员和业务员，但都限定必须邮电职工供养的直系亲属，才有资格报名。我觉得这是不公平，而且对工作不利的。因为这使大家觉得邮电不是人民大众的企业，而是邮电职工的企业。并且由于拒绝了很多愿意服务于邮电事业而非邮电职工的直系亲属的优秀青年的投考，无形中便降低了录取的水平。就以上次电信局招考的话务员来说，如果允许非职工家属的青年投考，由较多的投考人里面考选，那么被录取的人业务条件一定会提高得多。如此，对于提高整个邮电工作人员的水平是有利的。
    现在某些负责干部对这种办法的解释是：为了照顾一些家庭生活困难的职工，给他们家属找工作的机会。我觉得这也是不对的。因为家庭有困难的职工，不一定就能有人合于投考的条件，而合于投考条件的人又不一定能考得上。所以由于这种办法，而能解决了家庭困难的人，恐怕是太少了。我以为照顾家庭特别困难的职工也只应在公开招考时给以优先录取的机会，像这样有行会倾向的办法，是不应当让它发展下去的。
    我的意见不知道对不对，希望能发表出来，供有关部门参考。

    编者按：郭曼一君所提的意见，希望邮电部加以考虑。
