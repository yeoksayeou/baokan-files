To the Editor:

In Caohuang District of Guangshan County, Henan Province, the flood disaster last year was very serious, and the lives of the farmers in the disaster area were very difficult. However, thanks to the relief provided by the People's Government and the leadership given to the disaster victims to engage in various forms of production, the disaster victims' confidence in production for self-salvation has been enhanced, and the disaster situation has turned towards stability. The People's Government has already distributed 16,000 catties of relief grain, 100,000 catties of sideline grain, 35 million yuan in feed loans, and 1,470 sets of winter clothing to Caohuang District.

The production and disaster relief inspection team sent by the Huangchuan Special Office to Guangshan County discovered some corruption cases and inappropriate issues in the distribution of grain loans in Caohuang District. For example, Wei Hanzhong, the head of Zhongdu Township, embezzled 100,000 yuan in loans, and Xu Shengman, a district representative, also used 20,000 yuan of feed loans for personal use.

When Daizhai Township distributed sideline loans, they stipulated that only those who could carry 100 catties of burden could receive loans, which made it impossible for some poor farmers with weaker physical strength in the township to engage in sideline production to survive the disaster. Individual villages lent grain to former puppet township heads, landlords, and other people who should not have received grain, or lent an average of 150 catties to each household. Due to the incorrect application of loan policies, some of the grain and funds were not able to fully play their due role. The inspection team has assisted the local government in correcting these unreasonable phenomena in the distribution of grain and loans.

The local disaster victims expressed their deep gratitude to the government for helping them in production and self-salvation.

    光山县曹黄区
　　纠正贷放粮款的偏向编辑同志：
    河南省光山县的曹黄区，去年水灾非常严重，灾区农民生活很困难。但是经过人民政府的救济，并领导灾民进行各种生产，现在灾民生产自救的信心已经增强，灾情已经转向稳定。人民政府对曹黄区现已发放了救济粮一万六千斤，副业粮十万斤，饲料贷款三千五百万元，寒衣一千四百七十套。
    潢川专署派往光山县的生产救灾检查组，曾在曹黄区发现了一些贪污案件与放贷粮款中不适当的事情。其中如中渡乡乡长魏汉中，曾贪污贷款十万元，区代表徐胜满也曾私用饲料贷款二万元。
    戴砦乡在发放副业贷款时，曾规定能挑百斤担子的才能得到贷款，以致该乡有一些体力较弱的贫苦农民，想作副业生产度灾也不可能。个别村庄曾将粮食贷给了伪乡长、地主等不应得到贷粮的人，或是平均每户贷给了一百五十斤。由于放贷政策掌握不正确，以致使一部分粮款没有能充分发挥应有的作用。对于这些发放贷粮、贷款不合理的现象，检查组已帮助当地政府进行了纠正。
    当地灾民对于政府帮助他们生产自救，表示非常感激。
