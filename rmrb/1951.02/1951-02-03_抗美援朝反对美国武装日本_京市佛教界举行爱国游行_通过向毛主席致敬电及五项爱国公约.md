Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Opposing the United States Arming Japan
    Beijing Buddhist Community Holds Patriotic Parade
    Passes a Message of Respect to Chairman Mao and Five Patriotic Pledges
    [Our Dispatch] The Beijing Buddhist community held an unprecedented patriotic demonstration parade, fully demonstrating the patriotic will of Chinese Buddhists to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism arming Japan. On the morning of February 2nd, more than 80% of the monks and nuns in Beijing gathered from over 400 temples and nunneries in the city and suburbs to the Zhongshan Park Music Hall to hold a patriotic demonstration parade to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism arming Japan. Also participating in the meeting were Buddhist laymen and women, representatives of lamas from 32 temples in Beijing, and students from elementary schools run by the Buddhist community, totaling more than 2,200 people.
    At around 11:00 AM, the meeting began with the majestic sound of the national anthem. Venerable Master Jūzàn spoke, explaining that the actions of the Buddhist community today were not a miracle, but were inspired by Chairman Mao and the People's Government. This shows that Buddhists also love their motherland as much as people from all walks of life across the country. He praised the righteous act of 1,300 Buddhists in Seoul, Korea, participating in the People's Self-Defense Forces, called on Buddhists across the country to support the Korean people with practical actions, and warned against American imperialism using Buddhism to carry out conspiracies. Layman Yè Gōngchuò spoke, explaining from the Buddhist teachings that Buddhists should resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression. Lama Tái Yuánzhēn, Dharma Master Hǎi Cén, and Dharma Master Rén Guān (nun) all expressed the determination and confidence of Buddhists to resist America and aid Korea in their speeches.
    After free speeches, the meeting passed a resolution to establish the "Beijing Buddhist Community Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression," and elected 39 members, including Venerable Master Jūzàn, Dharma Master Kuānxiáng, Layman Yè Gōngchuò, Layman Lǐ Shūchéng, Dharma Master Yùshān, and Lama Tái Yuánzhēn.
    Finally, amidst warm applause, the meeting unanimously passed a message of respect to Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the Korean People's Army, as well as the "Declaration of the Beijing Buddhist Community's Patriotic Demonstration Parade to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Oppose Arming Japan." The meeting also established five patriotic pledges to express their patriotic determination.
    After the meeting, more than 2,000 monks, nuns, laymen and women, and students held a patriotic demonstration parade. They wore gray-black clothes, wind caps, carried large portraits of Chairman Mao, Stalin, Kim Il-sung, and leaders of communist parties from various countries, and shouted slogans such as "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression!" and "Oppose Arming Japan!" The parade was warmly welcomed by citizens along the way.
