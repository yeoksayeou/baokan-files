    Some Opinions of Yexian Peasants on the Government

    Editor:

    I myself work in Beijing. During the Spring Festival, I returned to my hometown of Yexian County, Shandong. While I was at home, I heard peasants praising the local People's Government in various ways; but I also heard peasants criticizing the Yexian People's Government on one point.

    During the summer planting of 1950, the Yexian People's Government called on peasants to plant more corn, and promised that during topdressing, the cooperative would supply soybean cake, fertilizer powder, and other fertilizers at low prices. The peasants listened to the government and changed their original planting plans; some villages planted twice as much corn as in previous years. However, when it came time for topdressing, the cooperative only distributed a very small amount of soybean cake, and some of the soybean cake that was distributed was already "heartburned" (spoiled), and some was moldy. Some villages did not even receive these bad soybean cakes.

    Corn especially needs fertilizer. The peasants planted corn, but couldn't buy fertilizer. Therefore, the peasants were somewhat dissatisfied with this matter, feeling that the government was not thoughtful enough for the peasants.

    This matter demonstrates the lack of planning of the Yexian People's Government in leading agricultural production, which caused losses to the peasants. It is hoped that the people's governments in various places will pay attention to this point in leading the spring plowing of 1951.

### 掖县农民对政府的一点意见

　　掖县农民对政府的一点意见
    编辑同志：
    我自己是在北京工作。春节期间我曾回到故乡山东掖县。我在家乡的时候，听到农民们对当地人民政府的各种赞扬；但也听到了农民对掖县人民政府的一项批评。
    一九五零年夏种的时候，掖县人民政府曾号召农民多种苞米，并答应在追肥的时候由合作社以低价供给豆饼、肥田粉等肥料。农民们听了政府的话，纷纷改变了自己原来的种植计划；有的村子较往年多种了两倍苞米。但是到了追肥的时候，合作社只配售了数量很小的一部分豆饼，而且配售的豆饼中有些已经“烧心”，有些已经霉烂，有的村子就连这些坏豆饼也没有买到。
    苞米是特别需要肥料的。农民们种了苞米，却买不到肥料。因此农民对这件事情就有些不满，感到政府为农民们打算的还不够周到。
    这件事情表现了掖县人民政府在领导农业生产中的无计划性，因此使农民受到了损失。希望各地人民政府在领导一九五一年的春耕中注意此点。
