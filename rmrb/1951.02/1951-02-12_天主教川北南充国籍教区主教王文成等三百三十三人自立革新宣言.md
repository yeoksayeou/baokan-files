The Catholic Church, after its introduction to China during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, was soon exploited by imperialism in every possible way, becoming a tool for the bloody invasion of China. Especially in the last hundred years, the imperialist countries, led by the United States, relied on the "missionary privileges in China" they had obtained, sending missionaries to China under the guise of spreading religion. In reality, they used the church and its affiliated hospitals, schools, and other organizations to conduct espionage and sabotage activities; they harbored some counter-revolutionary elements, controlled Catholic affairs, and used money and petty favors to deceive our good church members, seriously harming the interests of the motherland and the sanctity of the church itself. Recent cases uncovered in Catholic churches in various places involving US-Chiang Kai-shek espionage activities, and the training of Catholic students studying in the United States and missionaries fleeing to the south in the United States and Hong Kong, and then sending them back to the mainland to engage in activities, fully prove that the Catholic Church is being used by imperialism.

We used to confuse the reform movement against imperialism's use of religion with the reformed churches of Martin Luther, Calvin, and the Greek Orthodox Church, considering church "reform" as an act of "schism" that separated from the Pope and violated the doctrines. However, after studying, we realized that the religious organizations in various places and our reform movement today are based on the fundamental position of patriotism, and in the basic spirit of "Chinese people spreading Chinese religion," fundamentally changing the system of the Catholic Church being controlled by imperialism, without hindering our freedom to believe in the Roman Catholic tradition. In the past, 30 to 40 percent of our missionary expenses were subsidized by the Vatican General Church, which was considered a donation from Catholics around the world and had nothing to do with imperialism. Now, after reviewing China's history of the last hundred years and analyzing the internal and external environment of the Catholic Church, we truly realize the essence of imperialism's consistent use of the church for aggression. In particular, the recent remarks made by Austin, the spokesperson of US imperialism, at the United Nations, pointed out that the Vatican's expenses are mainly supported by the United States, which openly admits this point. We are sons and daughters of the motherland and should use extreme anger and courage to wash away the bloody stains, to love our motherland, bravely stand up under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, support the Common Program, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, stand in the ranks of patriotism, completely sever all ties with the imperialist countries led by the United States, cut off economic assistance and communication relations with the Vatican, and implement "self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation." We also firmly support the State Council's decision on "the policy of handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups that accept US subsidies." More than 20,000 church members in our 13 counties are taking action, standing on the side of patriotism, striving to realize the reform of the Catholic Church, and striving to consolidate world lasting peace and build an independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous New China. We hope that Catholics all over the country will join us in striving for the reform of the Catholic Church.

At present, we must be highly vigilant, strictly guard against anti-people spies engaging in activities within the church and sabotaging our reform movement, and resolutely expose these conspiracies and resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements who are willing to serve imperialism. We are not afraid of any intimidation or slander against the Catholic reform movement, and we will resolutely fight against these sabotage activities, in order to thoroughly realize the self-reliance and reform of the Catholic Church in the shortest possible time.

　　天主教川北南充国籍教区主教王文成等三百三十三人自立革新宣言
    天主教从明万历年间传入中国后，不久即被帝国主义百般利用，作为血腥的侵略中国的工具。尤其在近百年来，以美国为首的帝国主义国家，凭借它取得的“在华传教特权”，派遣传教士来华，以传教为名，实际上利用教会及其附属之医院、学校等团体，进行间谍破坏活动；豢养一些反革命分子，控制天主教教务，利用金钱及小恩小惠，欺骗我们善良的教友，严重地违害着祖国人民的利益和教会本身的圣洁。如近几年中各地天主堂所破获的美蒋间谍活动案，及其在美国与香港对留美学生的天主教徒和南逃的传教士给予特务训练后，派回大陆活动等事，这更充分证明了天主教为帝国主义所利用。
    我们曾把反对帝国主义利用宗教的革新运动，与马丁路德、加尔文及希腊正教的革新教会混为一谈，把教会“革新”认为是脱离了教宗，违背了教义的“裂教”的行为。可是我们经过了学习之后，认识了各地宗教团体和我们今天的革新运动，是站在爱国主义的基本立场，本着“中国人传中国教”的基本精神，从根本上改变天主教受制于帝国主义的制度，丝毫不妨碍我们的信仰罗马公教传统的自由。在过去，我们百分之三十到四十的传教经费，是梵蒂冈总教会补助，认为是天下教友的捐助，与帝国主义无关。现在我们参看了中国近百年史，分析了天主教的内外环境之后，我们确实认识到帝国主义一贯利用教会侵略的实质。特别是近来美帝国主义的代言人奥斯汀在联合国发表的谈话，指出梵蒂冈的经费主要是美国支持，更赤裸裸的供认了此点。我们是祖国的儿女，应以极度愤怒和勇敢的心情，来涤除血腥的污渍，来热爱我们的祖国，在英明的毛主席领导下，勇敢的站起来，拥护共同纲领，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，站在爱国主义的行列里，彻底与美国为首的帝国主义国家割断一切关系，断绝与梵蒂冈的经济援助和通讯关系，实行“自治、自养、自传”。我们并坚决拥护政务院“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针”的决定。我们全区十三县，两万多教友行动起来，站在爱国主义的一边，为实现天主教的革新而奋斗，为巩固世界持久和平和建设一个独立、民主、统一、富强的新中国而奋斗。我们希望全国各地天主教友和我们一道，为天主教革新而奋斗。
    目前我们要严加警惕，严防反人民的间谍分子在教会内活动与对我们的革新运动进行破坏，并须坚决揭露这些阴谋，坚决清除甘愿为帝国主义服务的反革命分子。我们决不怕任何对天主教革新运动的恐吓和诬蔑，与这些破坏活动进行坚决的斗争，以期天主教的自立革新在最短期间彻底实现。
