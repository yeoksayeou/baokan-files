Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 12th: On the eve of the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, a reporter interviewed the famous Soviet writer Simonov, asking him to express his views on the significance of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges, the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend their country, and the U.S. arming of Japan. He gave the following speech:

I. Regarding these questions, I would like to say a few words as a Soviet writer and as someone who had the honor of visiting Beijing on the day the People's Republic of China was founded.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in February 1950 was not an accident for Chinese friends in the Soviet Union or Soviet friends in China. It was a formal state treaty to consolidate the long-standing friendly feelings between our two great peoples.

Friendship always means mutual understanding between friends, and the mutual understanding of the interests of China and the Soviet Union and their peoples is reflected in the treaty.

Friendship means equality, and this equality is also reflected in the treaty.

Friendship means mutual assistance between friends, and this is also reflected in the treaty.

Therefore, the Soviet people welcomed the signing of the treaty with such deep sympathy and joy at that time, and today, on the first anniversary of the treaty, they regard the treaty as the most important state document, from which one can see the future far away.

II. When we talk about friendly relations, I would rather say it is the brotherly relationship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people. When I say that the Soviet people are deeply concerned about everything China is doing now, I cannot help but recall the scene when I visited voters in the Smolensk, Kaluga, and Bryansk regions shortly after the treaty was signed (note: the Soviet Union was preparing for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union at that time). These three districts had been occupied by the German Kou. I remember when I spoke to the voters, not a single one of them did not ask me about China, because they all knew that I had visited the new China not long ago. They asked me what I saw in China, asked about the Chinese army, the Chinese working class, and the Chinese people. They were very concerned and asked: Were the losses to China's national economy caused by the occupation of the Japanese Kou and the rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang great? These people themselves had also suffered from enemy occupation and infringement, so they asked about these things in China like brothers, and they were eager to know whether the Chinese people had quickly healed the wounds of war. This shows an incomparably deep feeling.

III. I think the cultural characteristics of our two countries are that they are both countries with rich ancient cultures and new advanced cultures. In this sense, our respect for our past culture and our struggle to create a new culture unite us even more. The Chinese Art Exhibition held in Moscow not long ago showed this. The Soviet people respect their old culture, and at the same time, they pay great attention to ancient Chinese culture. The new things that have appeared in Chinese culture have attracted no small attention among the Soviet people, and now may attract even more. I think that cultural workers in our two countries still have a lot of work to do in this regard. We have made preliminary attempts at cultural exchange, but there is still much to be done. This is the same for writers, painters, filmmakers, and theater workers. If, in general, certain preliminary achievements have been made in cultural exchanges, then it should be regarded as only the first step, because compared to our tasks, this is still very little. We are people who look forward, do not think about what has been done, but think about the huge amount of work that still lies before us. I think this is right for both us and you.

IV. It was not accidental that the Americans announced the invasion of Korea and Taiwan on the same day. Even children can understand that this shows their aggression against the Korean people, which is also aggression against the Chinese people.

However, the era when imperialism could luckily carry out this aggression without any punishment has passed, and now they cannot do it. Although they were hoping to be unpunished, they were actually punished: The Korean People's Army is punishing them, and the Chinese People's Volunteers are punishing them. The Chinese and Korean people responded with blows against a common enemy.

There is not a single honest and rational person in the world who does not believe that the Chinese people are peace-loving, that the Chinese people are powerful and united. The Chinese people have once again proved this in the Korean incident. They have proved that they are peace-loving in the negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the dispute, that they are powerful on the battlefield, and that they are united in the powerful movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend their country, which is sweeping across China.

V. Just recently, because of my writing, I went through my notes on the Nomonhan Incident in 1939 (note: referring to the incident of the Japanese Kou invading the Mongolian People's Republic) that I had experienced. I remembered that even at that time, Japanese imperialism was armed with German anti-aircraft guns and supplied with American military trucks. If this connection between the United States and Japan is not very eye-catching now, then I would not have remembered this. It is a joke to say that the American ruling group sympathizes with the Japanese people. They despise and hate the Japanese people, but they like to use knives to kill people. This was known to everyone in the past, and it has been proved once again in Korea now. In order to use knives to kill people in the East, they need the reactionary Japanese government and the fascistized army. They have established the former and are now establishing the latter. I visited Japan in 1946, and even then it was very clear to me what the Americans were going to do. At that time, they were trying to preserve the Japanese police system and former Japanese officers. At that time, I visited an airport, where a Japanese division led by a general and completely not demobilized was preserved in the form of a "pioneer group." I visited prisons. During the visit, I found that all the prison directors in these prisons were new people, but further questions revealed that they were just playing tricks in circles: the director of the Tokyo prison was new, because he was the former director of, say, the Osaka prison, and the director of the Tokyo prison was transferred to Sendai, and the director of the Sendai prison was transferred to another prison. In this way, they are just playing a new trick in order to divert attention. In fact, everything remains the same. I remember these things because at that time this was already a prominent feature of the American policy toward Japan, a policy aimed at preserving the reactionary Japan and Japanese militarists as servants that the Americans would soon use for aggression. As the Russian proverb says, at that time this was just a flower, and now we see the fruit.

The American conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism is doomed to fail. Because the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is powerful and invincible. Because what now opposes the American imperialist policy in Asia is the great People's Republic of China. Because the people of Asia in general now have the ability to defend themselves. Finally, because the Japanese people's struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism is now underway and will continue.

　　中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年前夕        
    西蒙诺夫谈中苏友好和中苏文化交流
    【新华社莫斯科十二日电】在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年前夕，记者访问了苏联名作家西蒙诺夫，请他对中苏条约签订的意义、中苏人民的友谊、中苏文化交流、中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动以及美国武装日本等问题发表意见。承发表谈话如下：
    一、对于这些问题，我愿意作为一个苏联作家和有幸在中华人民共和国宣告成立的日子到过北京的人，说几句话。
    一九五○年二月签订的中苏条约，不论对在苏联的中国朋友和在中国的苏联朋友都不是意外的事。那曾是借国家条约的形式来巩固我们两个伟大人民之间久已存在的友好感情。
    友好永远意味着朋友的互相了解，中苏两国及两国人民利益的互相了解已反映在条约之中。
    友好意味着平等，这平等也反映在条约之中。
    友好意味着朋友互助，这也反映在条约之中。
    因此，苏联人民当时以那样深切的同感与愉快欢迎条约的签订，今天在缔约一周年的时候，又把条约看作一个最重要的国家文献，从它可以远远地看到了未来。
    二、当我们说到友好关系时，我更愿说它是苏联人民对中国人民的兄弟关系。当我说到苏联人民深切关注中国现在所做的一切时，我情不自禁地回忆起在条约刚刚签订之后，我到斯摩棱斯克、卡卢日斯克和布利安斯克区访问选民的情景（按：当时苏联正在准备苏联最高苏维埃的选举）。这三个区过去曾遭德寇占领。我记得当我向选民们讲话的时候，没有一个人不向我询问中国的事情，因为他们都知道我在不久以前访问过新中国。他们问我在中国看到什么，问中国的军队、中国的工人阶级和中国人民。他们非常关心地问：日寇的占领和美帝国主义和国民党的统治给中国国民经济的损失大不大。这些人自己也是受过敌人的占领和侵害的，因此他们像兄弟一样询问中国的这些事情，他们急想知道，中国人民是否很快医好了战争的创伤。这里表现着无比深厚的情感。
    三、我想我们两国在文化方面的特色是：它们都是既有丰富的古代文化又有新的先进文化的国家。在这个意义上，我们对自己过去文化的尊重和为创造新文化而进行的斗争，更使我们结合起来。不久以前在莫斯科举行的中国艺术展览会就表明了这一点。苏联人民是尊重自己旧有的文化的，同时对于中国古代文化也非常注意。中国文化中出现的新的事物，在苏联人民中间已引起了不小的而现在可能是更大的注意。我想我们两国的文化工作者在这方面还要做很多的工作。我们已经作了文化交流的初步尝试，可是要做的事情还非常多。这对于作家、画家、电影工作者和戏剧工作者都是一样。如果一般说来在文化交流上已经达到了某些初步的成就，那么应当把它看作只是第一步，因为比起我们的任务来，这还做的很少。我们是向前看的人，不要想那些已经做了的事情，而要想那些还摆在我们面前的浩大工作。我想这不论对我们和你们都是对的。
    四、美国人在同一天宣布侵略朝鲜和台湾并不是偶然的，这连小孩子都能明白，这是表明了他们对朝鲜人民的侵略，同时也就是对中国人民的侵略。
    然而，帝国主义侥幸实现这种侵略而不受任何惩罚的时代已经过去了，现在他们是行不通了。他们虽然巴盼着不受惩罚，但是他们实际上受到了惩罚：朝鲜人民军在惩罚他们，中国人民志愿军在惩罚他们。中朝两国人民以对共同敌人的打击作了回答。
    世界上没有一个诚实而有理智的人不相信中国人民是爱好和平的，中国人民是强大有力和团结一致的。中国人民在朝鲜事件中又一次证明了他们是这样。在和平解决纠纷的谈判中证明他们是爱好和平的，在战场上他们强大有力，而在遍及全中国的强大的抗美援朝保家卫国运动中他们是团结一致的。
    五、刚在不久以前，因为写作的缘故我翻阅了我经历过的一九三九年哈尔新河事件（按指日寇侵略蒙古人民共和国事件）的笔记。我记起了还在那个时候日本帝国主义就是由德国的高射炮来武装，由美国的军用卡车来补给的。如果美国和日本的这种联系现在不十分触目，那我就不会记起这桩事情了。如果说美国统治集团同情日本人民，那是笑话。他们蔑视和仇视日本人民，可是他们喜欢借刀杀人。这是过去大家都知道的，而现在又一次在朝鲜得到了证明。为了借刀在东方杀人，他们需要日本的反动政府和法西斯化的军队。他们已建立前者，现在正建立后者。我是在一九四六年到过日本的，还在当时我就很清楚美国人要怎样做了。当时他们已力图保存日本的警察制度和前日本军官。那时我曾到过一个飞机场，那里在“开拓团”的形式下保存了一个由将军率领而完全没有复员的日本师团。我曾访问过监狱。在访问当中我发现了所有这些监狱的监狱长都是新人，但进一步发问时才发现他们原来是兜圈子玩花样：东京监狱长是新的，因为他是比方说大阪的前监狱长，而东京监狱长则调到了仙台，仙台监狱长又调到另一个监狱。这样，他们只是为了转移视线而玩个新花样罢了，事实上一切都原封不动。我记起这些事情，是因为当时这已经是美国对日政策的显著特点，这个政策的目的就是保存反动的日本和日本的军国主义者，作为美国人很快用来进行侵略的仆从。正如俄国成语所说的，当时这只是花，现在我们看见了果。
    美国复活日本军国主义的阴谋终究要破产的。因为以苏联为首的和平、民主阵营是强大不可战胜的。因为现在反对美国在亚洲的帝国主义政策的是伟大的中华人民共和国。因为一般说亚洲人民现在有能力保卫他们自己。最后，因为日本人民反对复活日本军国主义的斗争现在正在进行，而且还要进行下去。
