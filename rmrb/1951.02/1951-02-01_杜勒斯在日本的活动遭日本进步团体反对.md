　　Dulles' Activities in Japan
    Opposed by Japanese Progressive Groups
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] War-monger Dulles' conspiracy to instigate a separate peace treaty with Japan and re-arm Japan in Japan has been unanimously opposed by Japanese progressive groups. According to a twenty-ninth dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency: After Dulles arrived in Japan, he received an open letter signed by representatives of sixty Japanese democratic organizations, demanding the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with the participation of the Soviet Union and China, and condemning the attempt to re-militarize Japan.
    Another dispatch: The Japan Labor-Farmer Party also decided on the 24th to present to Dulles its opinion that "in order to achieve Japan's complete independence, peace, and free trade, it is necessary to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with the Allied powers." The Labor-Farmer Party also pointed out in its request: If one relies on methods such as rearmament and strengthening the strength of the police reserve force to "guarantee security," then "there is no other way except to drag Japan into war."

　　杜勒斯在日本的活动
    遭日本进步团体反对
    【新华社三十一日讯】战争贩子杜勒斯在日本策动单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋，遭到日本进步团体的一致反对。据电通社二十九日消息：杜勒斯到日本后，收到一封由六十个日本民主团体的代表签名的公开信，信中要求缔结有苏联和中国参与的全面和约，并谴责使日本重新军国主义化的企图。
    又讯：日本劳农党亦曾于二十四日决定向杜勒斯提出“为了日本的完全独立、和平以及自由通商，要求与盟国缔结全面和约”的意见。劳农党在其要求中并指出：如果依靠重新武装与加强警察后备队实力等方法来“保障安全”的话，“除将日本卷入战争之外，别无他路。”
