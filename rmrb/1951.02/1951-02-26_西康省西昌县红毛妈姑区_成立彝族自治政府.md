　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th: Ya'an dispatch: The first autonomous government of the Yi people in Xikang Province, the Yi Autonomous District People's Government of Hongmao Magu District in Xichang County, was established on January 19th. The autonomous district convened its first People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups on January 16th to discuss the organizational issues of the autonomous district's People's Government. The conference acted on behalf of the People's Congress and elected Yi people Luo Honglaha and Nuomi Aha as the district chief and deputy district chief of the autonomous district, respectively. Among the nineteen members elected, fifteen were Yi people. After the meeting, the Yi representatives who participated in the meeting returned to their hometowns and convened celebrations for the establishment of the Yi Autonomous District People's Government, calling on all ethnic people to unite better.
    The Hongmao Magu District has a population of over 20,000 people. More than nine-tenths are Yi people. The local people's government has correctly implemented the ethnic policies in the past year and assisted the Yi people in mediating internal disputes. In recent months, all members of the first branch of the Central People's Government's Southwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation have visited and conducted propaganda among the various branches and families of the Yi people in the district. As a result, the political awareness of the Yi people in the district has gradually increased, and they have successively requested the establishment of their own political power in order to better carry out the work in the Yi areas.

　　西康省西昌县红毛妈姑区
    成立彝族自治政府
    【新华社重庆二十四日电】雅安讯：西康省第一个彝族人民的自治政府——西昌县红毛妈姑区彝族自治区人民政府，已于一月十九日成立。该自治区于一月十六日召开了第一次各民族人民代表会议，讨论了自治区人民政府的组织问题。会议代行人民代表大会职权，选出彝族人民罗洪拉哈、糯米阿哈分任该自治区的正、副区长。在选出的十九名委员中，有十五名是彝族。会后，参加会议的彝族代表们都回乡分别召开了庆祝彝族自治区人民政府成立的大会，号召全族人民更好地团结起来。
    红毛妈姑区共有人口两万余人。十分之九以上是彝族。当地人民政府一年来正确地执行了民族政策，协助彝族人民调解了内部纠纷。最近数月来，中央人民政府西南各民族访问团第一分团的全体团员，又分别对该区彝族各支、各家进行了访问和宣传，因而，该区彝族人民的政治觉悟逐渐提高，他们纷纷要求建立自己的政权，以便更好地开展彝民地区的工作。
