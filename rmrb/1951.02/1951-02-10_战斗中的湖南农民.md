Hunan Peasants in Battle
    Li Junlong, State Council Counselor

    Hunan peasants are in battle. This is a grander and more extensive anti-feudal historical struggle of Hunan peasants after the Great Revolution from 1924 to 1927. After twenty-three long years, having suffered the long-term oppression of reactionary rulers such as Chiang Kai-shek and He Jian, Hunan peasants, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, in the new era of "the people ruling the country," have finally launched a struggle for emancipation against the landlord class with a more magnificent, solid, and extensive lineup. The scene of this battle is extremely grand, the process of the battle is extremely tortuous, and the deployment of the battle is also extremely complex. Now is the beginning stage of moving from the prelude battle to a full-scale battle. I once served as a new recruit on a corner of the battlefield and had the opportunity to see several battlefields. Here, I would like to try to provide a rough introduction to some actual observations first.

            I. Battlefield
    Speaking of the rural revolution in Hunan, one must think of the great battle of Hunan peasants in 1927. Anyone who has read Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" published in 1927 cannot fail to be deeply impressed. This immortal great work is still a classic of the peasant revolutionary struggle today. Hunan peasants are forever proud of the peasant revolutionary movement personally led by Chairman Mao. In particular, the counties of Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Hengshan, Liling, and Changsha, which Chairman Mao visited in those years, have even more folk stories circulating. They have a sincere love and strong faith in the people's leader, and they have not lost confidence even in the darkest years. Many people have also preserved the valuable documents and books of those years, which were unearthed from the soil after liberation and displayed as the most glorious mementos. But this is speaking in terms of the excellent revolutionary tradition. As for the revolutionary organizations, they suffered severe destruction after the failure of the Great Revolution. The bloody rule of the reactionaries after the May 21 (Ma Ri) Incident in 1927 dealt a extremely cruel blow to the revolutionary vitality of the Hunan people. Under the crazy butcher policy of "better to kill ten thousand by mistake than to let one escape," the revolutionary organizations in the rural areas of Hunan were almost completely destroyed, and only a very few staunch elements were struggling arduously. It was in such an environment of the strongest revolutionary tradition and the greatest reactionary devastation that the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government, under the principles of the central and south-central overall deployment of land reform, arranged the battlefield for land reform in Hunan.

    Hunan Province has seventy-seven counties with a population of thirty million. The thirty-three counties where land reform is being carried out this year have a population of about twenty million. In terms of area, the land reform area accounts for more than forty percent of the province's area, and in terms of population, it accounts for more than sixty percent. Because the people of Hunan have undergone a series of revolutionary struggles under the leadership of the People's Government since liberation, this land reform movement has unfolded in the following situation: From the grain lending, support for the front, and autumn grain collection of the year before last, to the rent reduction, deposit refund, coping with famine, and disaster relief of last spring, and the drought resistance, disaster relief, and emergency rescue of last summer, to last year's autumn grain collection, this series of work includes an extremely arduous process of revolutionary and counter-revolutionary struggle. In particular, last spring, the landlord class and reactionaries used the spring famine to organize riots to seize grain, which was the most serious test for the people of Hunan. At that time, the landlord class's vicious conspiracy was to use the spring famine to incite the masses to attack the People's Government. The reactionary and inflammatory slogan "The people have no grain, but the government's granaries are full" was found on the warehouses in many places. The landlords in Nan County first organized riots to seize grain, and the reactionaries in various places also rose up in response. Fortunately, the leaders of Hunan Province immediately launched a mass rent reduction and deposit refund movement in response to this conspiracy of the landlord class, turning the fire set by the landlord class back to burn the landlord class. Because the Hunan peasants have a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, they easily saw through the conspiracy of the landlord class and immediately responded to the call of the Provincial People's Government to launch a universal rent reduction and deposit refund struggle against the landlord class. Under the pressure of the broad masses, the peasants of the province received a total of more than 500 million jin of grain, and the government lent more than 200 million jin of grain, so the spring famine was overcome, and the transition to production was immediately made. Last summer, there was a prolonged drought, and the landlord class took the opportunity to agitate the peasants again. In some places, the landlords spread rumors to the peasants, saying, "The work team does not believe in gods and has offended the Dragon King, so it will not rain." They wanted to use this to arouse the peasants' resentment towards the work team and the People's Government as the second step in resisting land reform. The People's Government immediately launched a mass drought resistance movement with all its strength to help the peasants solve the problem and attack the landlords. Our leaders at all levels of government, work teams, and cadres at all levels worked day and night with the peasants to fight the drought, digging wells, opening dams, turning river water..., and organizing the peasants to manage water sources, and all the ponds and dams privately occupied by the landlord class were irrigated according to a planned distribution. This not only overcame nature but also further connected with the masses and enhanced the people's faith in the People's Government. It did not rain heavily until July 23, when the peasants said happily: "Thanks to Chairman Mao for establishing a good government for us and doing our best to do good things for us. Our rice fields have not dried up, and the heavens are also afraid of the struggle and have rained heavily!" The landlord class helplessly whispered, "The heart of heaven has also surrendered to them, and there is no way." These two examples show that today's land reform battlefield in Hunan is unfolding immediately following a series of revolutionary struggles after liberation. Its historical and social nature shows that it is an important historical stage in the development of the Hunan people's emancipation movement.

            II. Strategic Situation
    Land reform is "a systematic and fierce struggle," so there are two sides, the enemy and us, and "the basic principle of war is to preserve oneself and eliminate the enemy," which is to preserve a peasant class and eliminate a landlord class. Therefore, we can also tentatively borrow the strategic guiding principles of the military to explain the strategic situation of land reform in Hunan.

    First, explain the class relations and the balance of class forces in rural Hunan. According to the survey materials of the Policy Research Office of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the most prominent first characteristic of rural Hunan is the high concentration of land. The land distribution situation in Hunan counties is very inconsistent. According to the scope of the province, it can be divided into three types of areas: lakeside, hilly, and mountainous. The lakeside area has the highest land concentration. For example, the most typical Xiangyin, landlords only account for about 2% of the number of households in the county, but own 71% of the land. The second is the hilly area. According to the survey of five baos in Lituo Township, Changsha County, and one bao in Yiyang County, landlords account for 4% of the population and 45% of the land (including public land), which can generally be regarded as the representative of the hilly area. The mountainous area is more dispersed. In the mountainous areas such as western Hunan, landlords generally occupy about 30% to 40% of the land. According to a survey of three baos in Shaoyang, landlords account for 3% of the population and 41% of the land (including public land). In addition, land is more concentrated near economically and traffic-developed cities (such as Changsha and Xiangtan), and more dispersed in remote mountainous areas. The land in the old land revolution areas is also more dispersed. The percentage of the population and land ownership of each class in the three types of areas is approximately as follows (approximate numbers are used):
District             Lakeside Area            Hilly Area            Mountainous Area
Class          Population    Land      Population    Land      Population    Land
Landlord          3      60      4      33      3      27
Rich Peasant         4      8        7      20       5      14
Middle Peasant        34    26      28    26        23    26
Poor Peasant        42    4        36    8          44    18
Farm Laborer        9                5                  16
Other        8      1         20    1          9     1
                      Public Land              Public Land              Public Land
                        1              12              14

    From the above table, we can see the land relations and class relations in rural Hunan. Generally speaking, 3% of the landlords occupy 50-60% of the land, while more than 60% of the population only has less than 10% of the land. This shows how concentrated the land is in rural Hunan and how obvious the class relations are. Under such circumstances, a total of thirty-three counties in Hunan Province have been carrying out land reform this past winter and spring. They include eight counties in Changsha Prefecture, namely Changsha, Xiangtan, Liuyang, Liling, Pingjiang, Yueyang, Xiangyin, and Linxiang; six counties in Yiyang Prefecture, namely Yiyang, Xiangxiang, Hanshou, Ningxiang, Yuanjiang, and Anhua; three counties in Shaoyang Prefecture, namely Shaoyang, Xinhua, and Wugang; seven counties in Changde Prefecture, namely Changde, Lixian, Huarong, Nanxian, Anxiang, Linli, and Cili; four counties in Hengyang Prefecture, namely Hengyang, Hengshan, Chaling, and Youxian; four counties in Yongzhou Prefecture, namely Lingling, Qiyang, Yongming, and Ningyuan; and Chenxian County in Chenxian Prefecture. These thirty-three counties include lakeside areas, hilly areas, mountainous areas, and old land revolution areas of the Great Revolution era.

    The second characteristic of rural Hunan is that there are particularly many poor peasants and farm laborers who have no land or little land. Chairman Mao's investigation in "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" can still summarize the characteristics of rural Hunan today, or the situation today is even worse. According to the survey of the Policy Research Office of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the population and land ownership of each class in rural areas are approximately as follows (the percentages are approximate, and the decimal points are omitted):
Class          Percentage of Population          Percentage of Land       Acres of Land per Person
Landlord              3                47               19
Rich Peasant              5                13                  5
Middle Peasant              30              26                  2
Poor Peasant              39              7                    0.2
Farm Laborer              10
Other              13
                                  (Public Land) 7

    According to this table, the poor peasant population is 39% and the farm laborer population is 10%. Among the other 13%, most are handicraft workers, small vendors, porters, and extremely poor households with no occupation at all. Farm laborers and extremely poor households actually account for about 20% of the rural population. The total number of poor peasants, farm laborers, and extremely poor households in the province is more than 60%, or even 70%, because in the areas with the highest concentration of land and population, there are particularly many poor peasants, farm laborers, and extremely poor households. For example, tenant farmers generally account for more than 90% in the lakeside polder fields. If this is included in the average calculation, the total number of poor peasants, farm laborers, and extremely poor households in the province is more than the 62% shown in the previous table. The broad masses of poor peasants only own 7% of the land. Farm laborers and the extremely poor "have neither land nor capital." This army of poor peasants and farm laborers, which accounts for 60% to 70% of the rural population, is the main force of all reforms in rural areas today, and it is also our main force in the land reform movement. Therefore, solving the land demands of the poor peasants, farm laborers, and the extremely poor is the most important issue in the land reform movement in Hunan. To solve this problem, we must grasp the general line of land reform of "relying on poor peasants and farm laborers and uniting with middle peasants," go deep into the masses, fully mobilize poor peasants and farm laborers, and establish the superiority of poor peasants and farm laborers in rural areas. Only then can we unite with middle peasants, overthrow the landlord class, and turn the feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class into land ownership by the peasants. This is the general strategic goal of today's land reform movement in Hunan.

            III. Battle Deployment
    Fighting the land reform battle is like fighting a military battle. The battle deployment must be determined according to the strategic situation. The general principle of the battle deployment of land reform in Hunan is "from point to surface, combining point and surface." The pilot project of land reform in Hunan was first arranged in conjunction with the autumn grain collection. Due to the series of works such as coping with famine and resisting drought mentioned earlier, the leaders and peasants of Hunan did not begin to shift to the land reform movement in a planned way until August of last year. After going through the work of rectifying the team, pilot projects, and autumn grain collection, the political consciousness and organizational strength of the Hunan peasants have been greatly improved. For example, the autumn grain collection of the province was completed more than 90% by the end of October, and Ningxiang completed the quota of 65 million jin of public grain in only seven days, which can only be done after the peasants' awareness has been raised. Out of the 30 million people in the province, about 20 million people are implementing land reform this year. The province has about 6 million members of the peasant association, and the rural government has been transformed for the most part. The peasant representatives' congress has essentially played the role of the government. At the beginning of the land reform work, 20% of the provincial peasant representative congresses were in power by poor and farm laborers, 60% were in power by middle peasants, and more than 10% had impure components. At that time, the leading organs planned to carry out all land reform areas in three or four batches, roughly completing them before April 15, 1951. The method adopted in the first batch of 50 key experiments and the second batch of 500 townships, which later expanded to 1,000 townships, was to make key breakthroughs, fully expand, combine points and surfaces, and develop in a wave-like manner, and advance in a leap-forward manner. In the second batch, each key point first arranged two sub-points, and transferred to the sub-points after breaking through half of them. This was done to gain experience, bring out cadres, prevent major deviations, expand the influence of land reform, and strive to carry out this great peasant emancipation struggle in an organized and orderly manner.

    From the end of October to the beginning of November, Hunan held a key summary meeting, and discovered some problems from the land reform pilot points. The most important of these problems was the cadre problem. As of December, there were about 22,000 to 23,000 cadres participating in land reform in Hunan, with about 20 to 30 people in each township. In the past, when land reform was implemented in North China, there were only a dozen cadres in each township, but today the number does not seem to be small. However, on the one hand, the rural area of Hunan is large, the population is large, and the population is scattered. The population of a township is about 5,000 to 8,000 people, and the population of a large township is as high as 13,000 to 14,000 people, so it is not easy to work. On the other hand, 93% of the land reform cadres are new cadres, and 70-80% of them are intellectuals from landlord and rich peasant families, and 20-30% are peasants. The longest time they have participated in revolutionary work is no more than a year, and the shortest time is only ten and a half months. Old cadres only account for 7-8%, and they are not all experienced in land reform work. In the first batch of pilot projects, there were a total of more than 1,800 cadres, of which only 70-80 were old cadres, no more than 30 had land reform experience, and no more than 40-50 were peasant cadres. In the work, it was found that many new cadres had not established class feelings politically, had not proceeded from the demands of the masses in their methods, and had not grasped the policy of deeply mobilizing and relying on poor peasants and farm laborers in the land reform line. The concept of peaceful reform and canceling the struggle was quite common. Fortunately, the leading organs discovered it early, issued timely instructions, opened up the minds of cadres, and educated and enlightened the peasants through various meetings and struggles. Since November, efforts have been made to correct the tendency of peaceful reform. In addition to personally going to the countryside to lead land reform work, leading cadres at all levels also often went to the grassroots level to understand the situation, and discovered and solved problems at any time. In this way, after a series of instructions, meetings, criticisms, and introductions of experience for more than two months, the land reform movement in Hunan took a big step forward in countering the tendency of peaceful reform. The masses generally have some mobilization, and individual places have very good mobilization (such as Lituo, Xishou, Jintuo, and He Township in Changsha County, Shiban Tan Township in Changde County, and Yankou Township in Yueyang County). Through a series of arduous struggles such as rent reduction, deposit refund, anti-hegemony, anti-sabotage, anti-concealment, and clearing out bandits and suppressing special agents, the awareness of the peasants has been improved, the peasant team has made progress after rectification, the cadres have more experience, the idea of peaceful land reform has been corrected, and the policy of relying on poor peasants and farm laborers to unite with middle peasants has become clearer. The senior responsible cadres of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Land Reform Committee also inspected the work of the first phase, and held a meeting at the beginning of 1951, summarizing the experience of the first phase of pilot projects of 1,000 townships, commending the achievements, pointing out the shortcomings, introducing good experiences, and criticizing bad ideological styles. The second phase of land reform's line and specific methods have been clearly decided based on the specific experience of the first phase, and these decisions must be implemented to every level of work cadre. Whether we look at it from the perspective of leading ideology or specific methods, we should say that the land reform movement in Hunan has made remarkable achievements. In the next two months, the anti-feudal battle will enter the full-scale battle in the areas with a population of 20 million in Hunan. Under the correct strategic guidance and battle deployment, we believe that we will be able to successfully complete the expected tasks.

            IV. Earth-shaking
    Once the peasant revolution rises, as Chairman Mao said: "Its momentum is like a storm, extremely rapid, and no matter how great the power is, it cannot be suppressed." Today, in rural Hunan, under the slogans of "the poor turning over" and "returning the land to the old home," nearly 20 million people have turned to the great battle of land reform. Although the climax of land reform has not yet arrived, the political influence of this revolutionary struggle has been quite widely spread through the first phase of pilot areas. If we casually walk to some rural areas and pass through some towns, we can see countless peasants wearing red "militia" armbands, carrying spears, broadswords, or rifles, leading lawless landlords to the township peasant associations or district governments. At night, there are patrolling militias everywhere, strictly preventing bandits and special agents from sabotaging telephone lines and other activities. On the main roads in rural areas, teams of men and women happily talk and discuss issues. They are either surveying land, holding meetings, fighting landlords, or repairing ponds and dams and engaging in production. Large-character slogans such as "Long live the peasants turning over," "Long live Chairman Mao," and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party" can be seen everywhere, and songs such as "Who Feeds Whom" and "Singing of Chairman Mao" can be heard everywhere. Labels are planted everywhere in the fields, and wasteland is being reclaimed everywhere on the sides of mountains and fields. This shows that a new look has begun to emerge in rural Hunan: the poor who used to be frowning and gloomy are starting to raise their heads, laugh, and fight a turnaround with full confidence; the landlord class that used to squeeze the blood and sweat of the peasants is starting to bow their heads, sigh, and tremble in front of the broad masses of peasants. The working people, who have always been hungry and cold in the old society, and the oppressed classes, who have always had no status, are now all raising their eyebrows and exhaling, and are beginning to be regarded as "people" by themselves and others; the landlord class, who have always lived a life of luxury in the old society, and all kinds of "earth emperors" who have always ridden on the heads of the people and acted as overlords, have begun to feel that they have lost their power under the awakening and strikes of the peasants! It is this kind of contrast that makes the rural areas of Hunan appear to be "earth-shaking"! A militia comrade in Xishou Township, Changsha, chatted with me, saying, "I was only fifteen years old when my father died. There was a widowed mother above, and younger siblings below. I didn't learn how to work in my own field well, and the damn bao chief wanted to conscript me. Japanese devils also came to plunder from time to time. At that time, there was really no way out, and I couldn't even get a bowl of thin porridge a day. Now, thanks to Chairman Mao, we have been allocated land and houses. After some time, I can also marry a wife, and I will never suffer the anger of those bastard landlords again! Old Li, you really don't know how happy we are!" Another poor peasant, Li Yuelou, told me that before liberation, a platoon of White Bandit soldiers was stationed in the elementary school where he lived. The platoon leader falsely accused him of being a "bandit agent," so he dared not go home. That night, the dog platoon leader ran into his wife's room to rape her. She refused to die, her pants were torn, and her head was also beaten. Finally, she escaped from the tiger's mouth. He said: "I never thought that I would become the group leader now, and my wife would become the women's committee member. Those bastards who oppressed our poor people have been driven away!" Doesn't this clearly tell us about the two worlds in the countryside from these chats? In the old society, peasants were not human beings, and from the reactionary armed forces to the bao chiefs, they were all oppressors of the peasants; in the new society, the peasants are in charge, and all reactionaries have fallen! We have participated in many rallies to fight landlords. When a bully landlord, who is usually very prestigious, is led by the peasants into a mass meeting for a grievance struggle, and when the peasants tell how he exploited the poor, how he bullied the good, and how he seized tenants, seized wives, and murdered for money, as long as you still have a sense of justice, you will naturally stand on the side of the peasants and feel that "the landlord class is evil" is not an excessive statement!

    Of course, in the earth-shaking situation, it is inevitable to accidentally injure some people, perhaps "the punishment is not appropriate," or perhaps "the innocent are punished," but this is only a very small local phenomenon. Looking at the entire revolutionary movement, it is "inevitable." Revolution is not embroidery or writing articles. 20 million people have really risen up. It is impossible for them to be completely perfect and make no mistakes at all. We can only do everything possible to ask for fewer deviations, no major deviations, and correct deviations when they occur. Moreover, in fact, as long as it is not a "replacement package" or manipulated by bad elements by cadres, nine out of ten times the punishment is "appropriate." The problem is still to deeply mobilize the masses and let the masses control this weapon of punishing the enemy themselves. After the landlord class falls in the earth-shaking situation, it is inevitable to shout a few times. The fugitive landlords hiding in the cities or those who are in line with the landlords in their consciousness will act as voluntary broadcasters for these shouts. If we don't want to be fooled, it is best to go to the countryside to see it for ourselves before speaking.

            V. Resisting America and Aiding Korea in the Countryside
    With the unfolding of the anti-feudal struggle, the political consciousness of the peasants is gradually improving. When we first went to the countryside in November, as soon as the peasants heard that we came from afar, the first sentence they would ask was "How is Chairman Mao doing?" The second sentence would ask how the battle in Korea was going? At that time, our People's Volunteers had not yet participated in the war, the American robbers were triumphantly crossing the 38th parallel and occupying Pyongyang, and American planes were bombing Andong one after another. It was natural for the peasants to care about the Korean war situation. At that time, in order to combat the rumors of the landlord class and special agents, and to correct the thinking of a small number of peasants who were afraid of the changing days, we launched the current affairs propaganda of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country in coordination with the land reform propaganda. When our People's Volunteers entered Korea, they really "won the first battle" and gave the American invaders a head-on blow, reversing the Korean war situation. Then the Chinese and North Korean People's troops fought several great victories, changing the entire Korean war situation, recovering Pyongyang, the Battle of Changjin Lake, chasing past the 38th parallel south, recovering Seoul..., this series of great victories caused great excitement among the peasants. The peasants' enthusiasm is getting bigger and bigger every day. They watch the blackboard newspapers and the large-character headlines of the newspapers sent from the city every day. When they meet them, they will talk a few words about the current situation. As soon as a meeting is held, they will naturally talk about the Korean war. For example: "Now the American imperialist paper tiger has been punctured by us, and McArthur (the peasants used this title to express their anger at the demon McArthur) was beaten to a pulp by our Chinese and North Korean People's Army. Are we still afraid of the landlords and special agents' rumors of the 'Third World War' and 'Old Jiang's return'?" "As long as Chairman Mao sits in Beijing and our peasants sit in the countryside (meaning peasant dictatorship), no matter what American imperialism or whatever, we guarantee to beat them to pieces!" With the peasants' enthusiasm getting bigger, the land reform problem will be easier to carry out, and the landlord class's resistance and rumors will also suffer a fatal blow. The masses assisted the government and public security organs in cracking down on many so-called "underground army" organizations throughout the province, and the government seized the opportunity to implement the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. Through the people's courts, military trials, and people's courts, various reactionary bandits and special agents who endangered the people's revolutionary cause were punished in batches. As a result, the revolutionary order in the province has become more stable. Even in the Longshan area of western Hunan and Shaoyang, which has always been known for banditry, the bandits have been basically eliminated, and the bandit leaders have all been brought to justice. The remaining few scattered bandits, because the masses have risen up and cannot be hidden, have no choice but to mend their ways and surrender to the People's Government. The security and traffic order in Hunan is now the best it has been in recent decades. In all the villages where land reform is being carried out, gambling has disappeared, and bad people and bad elements dare not do anything wrong. All activities are concentrated on fighting landlords and engaging in production. An old peasant who was more than seventy years old said to me: "I have lived to this old age, and I have never seen such a good world, nor have I seen such a good People's Liberation Army." With the great victory of our People's Volunteers in Korea, the "Resist America and Aid Korea" movement has unfolded in the countryside. The most prominent example is the frenzied enthusiasm of the peasants who have turned over to join the army. The day after we distributed the land in Xishou Township, we saw two township peasant teams using dragon lanterns, militias, and Yangko teams, and the gongs and drums were loudly sending off the turned-over young and middle-aged peasants to join the army. On the road from Xiangtan to Xiangxiang Shaoyang, we saw everywhere teams of peasants joining the army wearing newly issued cotton uniforms and singing the songs of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." In Shaoyang County alone, there were more than 8,000 people joining the army. The peasants all understand that aiding Korea is to protect the country, and joining the army is to defend the fruits of victory. Truman, MacArthur, Dulles, and other war mongers, listen, the new China, where the people have stood up, will never allow pig noses to be stretched into the people's garden!

            VI. Always Follow Chairman Mao
    The peasants of Hunan have the greatest spiritual support in the struggle for emancipation, which is the people's leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party led by him. When the peasants are in a meeting or chatting, they will talk about Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in three sentences. When we were working in Xishou Township, Langli District, Changsha, Lin Qingsheng, the chairman of the township peasant association, was a farm laborer who had been a long-term worker for twenty-eight years. He did not know many characters, but he was very upright and could talk. He had a high prestige among the masses. When he presided over the first meeting, he saw a buzzing conversation in the venue, and the meeting was not going well. He said loudly: "Comrade representatives! I am a crude person. Thank you for your appreciation and elected me as the chairman. Now that the land reform is about to be completed, the work comrades will be transferred to other places to help the poor turn over. Our affairs must be done by everyone. This is the first time I have been a chairman, and I have not mastered much. But Chairman Mao's portrait is on top. Is it embarrassing for me to be talking so much?" After he said this, the venue immediately became quiet, and the meeting went well. That day was the initial plan for class, and under his chairmanship, the masses studied the principles of class division and the list of landlords. The speeches were very enthusiastic and orderly. We sat among the peasants and listened, and everyone said, "Old Lin is really good." This incident shows that Old Lin understands the psychology of the masses, but also shows how much the peasants love the people's leader! One night, I was chatting with the poor peasant Old Liang. It was snowing outside. We burned firewood to keep warm. His family was there. I said, "Old Liang, we are leaving soon. Do you have anything else to talk about?" He was burning the fire while saying seriously: "Old Li, when you go back to Beijing and see Chairman Mao, please send my regards and say that my poor people turned over with his help, have land, and are no longer bullied and hungry. We must work hard to produce well and properly manage landlords and bad elements, so don't let him worry..." He said this in a serious manner, with an extremely sincere attitude. The old mother sitting next to him said: "Without him taking charge, my poor people really don't know what to do!" Seeing the emotions of his mother and son, I replied: "The regards can be delivered, and you can also write a letter to Chairman Mao to report. Chairman Mao never puts on airs. If Old Liang works hard and becomes a labor model and is elected as a labor model, he can also go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" He said: "It would be great if I could see Chairman Mao!" In the township for a month, there were many stories like this. The two most popular songs among the peasants are "Who Feeds Whom" and "Singing of Chairman Mao." Most peasants hold meetings at night. Whenever the meeting is deep at night, a group of men, women, and children, in order to reduce the loneliness of walking at night, either talk about issues or sing songs. Young peasants like to challenge women, and women are not willing to show weakness. Once they sing, everyone sings together. The singing rises and responds to each other, breaking the silence of midnight in the countryside. At first, the dogs in the landlords' houses would bark for a while when they saw the shadows and heard the singing, but after a long time, they would go to sleep in their nests. When you hear the song "Always Follow Chairman Mao, Follow the Communist Party" being sung among a group of peasants who have not had laughter for many years, you will naturally realize that this world has really changed!

　　战斗中的湖南农民
    政务院参事  李俊龙
    湖南农民在战斗中。这是一九二四年至一九二七年大革命后湖南农民更伟大更广阔的反封建的历史斗争。经过了二十三年的长久岁月，受尽了蒋介石何健等反动派统治的长期压榨，湖南农民终于在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，在“人民坐天下”的新时代，以更雄壮更坚实更广阔的阵容，向地主阶级展开了翻身的斗争。这一战斗的场面是极其伟大的，战斗的过程是极其曲折的，战斗的部署也是极其复杂的。现在正是由序幕战进入全面战斗的开始阶段。我曾经在战场的一角做个新兵，又曾经得到机会去看过几个战场。在这里，想把一些实际见闻，先试作一个轮廓的介绍。
            一、战场
    谈起湖南的农村革命，就要想到一九二七年湖南农民的伟大战斗。凡是读过毛主席在一九二七年所发表的《湖南农民运动考察报告》的人，没有不留下极深刻的印象的。这部不朽的伟大著作，直至今天仍然是农民革命斗争的经典。湖南农民永远以毛主席亲自领导过的农民革命运动自豪。尤其当年毛主席到过的湘潭、湘乡、衡山、醴陵、长沙等县，更是流传着许多民间故事。他们对于人民领袖有着真挚的爱戴和坚强的信仰，就是在最黑暗的年月，也没有失掉信心。不少的人还保存了当年的宝贵文件书刊，解放后从泥土中挖出，作为最光辉的纪念物陈列着。但这是就革命的优良传统方面说。至于革命的组织，在大革命失败后受到严重的摧残。反动派在一九二七年五月二十一日（马日）事变后的血腥统治，给湖南人民革命元气以极残酷的打击。在“宁可错杀一万，不可漏杀一个”的疯狂的屠夫政策下，湖南农村的革命组织几乎全被破坏，只有极少数的坚贞分子在艰苦地支撑着。就是在这样的革命传统最强和反动摧残最大的环境，湖南的中共省委和省人民政府，在中央和中南的土地改革总部署的原则下，来布置湖南土地改革的战场。
    湖南全省七十七个县，人口三千万。今年进行土地改革的三十三个县，人口约二千万，论地区搞土改的占全省面积百分之四十强，论人口约占百分之六十以上。由于解放后湖南人民在人民政府领导下经过一系列的革命斗争，这次的土地改革运动是在这样的局面下铺开的：从前年的借粮、支前、秋征，去年春天的减租、退押、度荒、救灾，去年夏天的抗旱、救灾、抢险，以至去年的秋征，这一系列的工作，包括一个极为艰巨的革命与反革命的斗争过程。尤其去年春天地主阶级和反动派利用春荒组织暴动抢粮，是湖南人民最严重的考验。当时地主阶级的恶毒阴谋，是要利用春荒来煽动群众打击人民政府。“百姓没有粮，政府粮满仓”的反动的煽动性标语，曾在许多地方的仓库上发现。南县地主首先组织暴动抢粮，各地反动派亦闻风而起。幸而湖南省的领导者立即针对地主阶级这一阴谋展开群众性的减租退押运动，把地主阶级放的火反转来烧向地主阶级。由于湖南农民有着光荣的革命斗争传统，容易识破地主阶级的阴谋，立即响应省人民政府的号召，向地主阶级普遍展开了减租退押斗争。在广大群众的压力下，全省农民共得到五亿几千万斤谷子，政府又贷了两亿多斤粮食，于是春荒得以度过，立即转入生产。去年夏天久旱不雨，地主阶级又乘机煽动农民。有些地方的地主对农民造谣说：“工作队不信神，得罪了龙王爷，所以下不了雨。”想借此引起农民怨恨工作队和人民政府，作为抵抗土改的第二步。人民政府又立即以全力展开群众性的抗旱运动，来帮助农民解决问题，打击地主。我们的各级政府首长，工作队，各级干部，夜以继日地和农民一道作抗旱斗争，一面打井、开坝、翻河水………，一面组织农民管理水源，将地主阶级私自占有的塘坝，一律按有计划的分配来灌溉农田。这样不仅战胜了自然，而且进一步的联系了群众，增强了人民政府在农民中的信仰。直到七月二十三日下了大雨，农民欢天喜地的说：“搭帮（依靠）毛主席替我们立了好政府，尽心替我们办了好事，我们的禾田冒（没有）干死，老天也怕斗争下了大雨了！”地主阶级无可奈何地窃窃私议地说：“天心也归顺他们了，冒办法。”从这两个例子说明今天湖南的土改战场，是紧接着解放后一系列的革命斗争铺开的。它的历史性和社会性说明它是湖南人民翻身运动的发展的一个重要历史阶段。
            二、战略形势
    土地改革既是“一场系统的激烈的斗争”，就有敌我两方面，而“战争的基本原则是保存自己消灭敌人”，就是要保存一个农民阶级和消灭一个地主阶级。因此，我们也可姑且借用军事上的战略指导原则，来说明湖南土地改革的战略形势。
    先说明湖南农村的阶级关系和阶级力量的对比。根据中共湖南省委政策研究室的调查材料，湖南农村最显著的第一个特点，是土地的高度集中。湖南各县土地分配的情况很不一致，按全省范围来说，可以分作滨湖、丘陵、山地这样三种地区。滨湖区域土地最集中。如最典型的湘阴，全县地主只占户数百分之二左右，占有土地达百分之七十一；其次是丘陵地区，据长沙县黎托乡五个保和益阳县一个保的调查，地主占人口百分之四，占土地百分之四十五（公田在内），大体可作为丘陵区的代表。山区较为分散，湘西等地山区，地主一般占地约百分之三十至四十；据邵阳三个保调查，地主占人口百分之三，占土地百分之四十一（公田在内）。此外，在经济、交通发达的城市附近（如长沙、湘潭），土地比较集中。偏僻山区比较分散。老土地革命地区的土地也比较分散。三种地区各阶级人口与土地占有的百分比，约如下表（取约数）：地区             滨湖区            丘陵区            山区阶级          人口    土地      人口    土地      人口    土地地主          三      六○      四      三三      三      二七富农         四      八        七      二○       五      一四中农        三四    二六      二八    二六        二三    二六贫农        四二    四        三六    八          四四    一八雇农        九                五                  一六其他        八      一         二○    一          九     一
                      公田              公田              公田
                        一              一二              一四
    从上表我们可以看出湖南农村的土地关系和阶级关系。总的说来，百分之三的地主，占了百分之五六十的土地，而百分之六十以上的人口，只有不到百分之十的土地，这就说明湖南农村的土地是如何集中，阶级关系是如何明显。在这样的情况下，湖南全省去冬今春的土改地区共为三十三个县，即长沙专区的长沙、湘潭、浏阳、醴陵、平江、岳阳、湘阴、临湘等八县，益阳专区的益阳、湘乡、汉寿、宁乡、沅江、安化等六县，邵阳专区的邵阳、新化、武冈等三县，常德专区的常德、澧县、华容、南县、安乡、临澧、慈利等七县，衡阳专区的衡阳、衡山、茶陵、攸县等四县，永州专区的零陵、祁阳、永明、宁远等四县，郴县专区的郴县，这三十三个县当中，包括了滨湖区、丘陵区、山区，也包括了大革命时代的老土地革命区。
    湖南农村的第二个特点是无地少地的贫农和雇农赤贫户特别多。毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中所作的调查，仍旧可以概括今天湖南农村的特点，或者今天的情形尚有过之。根据中共湖南省委政策研究室的调查，农村各阶级人口与土地占有情形约如下表（百分数取约数，小数点下略去）：阶级          人口百分比          土地百分比       每人占地亩数地主              三                四七               一九富农              五                一三                  五中农              三○              二六                  二贫农              三九              七                    ○·二雇农              一○其他              一三
                                  （公田）七
    根据此表，贫农人口为百分之三十九，雇农为百分之十。其他百分之十三中，多为手工工人、小商贩、挑脚的和根本无职业的赤贫户等。雇农和赤贫户在农村中实占人口百分之二十左右。全省贫雇农赤贫户总数在百分之六十以上，或达百分之七十，因为在土地和人口最集中的地区，贫雇农赤贫户特别多，如滨湖垸田中佃农一般占百分之九十以上。如将此平均算入，全省贫雇农赤贫户总数就不止前表的百分之六十二了。广大的贫农占有土地仅百分之七。雇农赤贫“既无土地又无资本”。这支占农村人口百分之六十到百分之七十的贫雇农大军，就是今天农村一切改革的主力，也就是我们在土地改革运动中的主力军。因此解决贫雇农及赤贫的土地要求，是湖南土改运动的最重要问题。而要解决这个问题，就必须掌握“依靠贫农、雇农，团结中农”的土地改革总路线，深入群众，充分发动贫、雇农，树立贫、雇农在农村的优势，然后才可以团结中农，打倒地主阶级，把地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制变为农民的土地所有制。这就是今天湖南土地改革运动的总的战略目的。
            三、战斗部署
    打土改仗也如同打军事仗一样，战斗部署是要根据战略形势来决定的。湖南土地改革的战斗部署的总原则是“由点到面，点面结合”。湖南土地改革的试点，最早的是结合秋征来布置的。由于前面所说及的度荒抗旱等一系列的工作，湖南的领导者和农民直到去年八月间才开始有计划地转入土地改革运动。在经过整队伍、试点、秋征等工作以后，湖南农民的政治觉悟和组织力量已经提高了一大步。如全省秋征在十月底即完成了百分之九十以上，宁乡六千五百万斤公粮的配额，仅七天即完成，这都是农民觉悟提高以后才能办到的。全省三千万人口，今年实行土地改革的地区约两千万，全省农协会员约六百万，乡村政权绝大部分经过改造，农民代表会在实质上起了政权的作用。在开始布置土地改革工作时，全省农代会有百分之二十为贫、雇农当权，百分之六十为中农当权，百分之十以上成份不纯。当时领导机关预定将全部土地改革地区分三批或四批进行，大体在一九五一年四月十五日前完成。第一批先搞五十个重点试验，第二批搞五百个乡，后扩展为一千个乡，所采取的方法是重点突破，全面展开，点面结合，波浪式的发展，跳跃式的前进。第二批中每一个重点先布置两个分点，突破一半即转移入分点。这样作法，是为了取得经验，带出干部，防止大的偏差，扩大土改的影响，力求有组织有秩序地进行这一伟大的农民翻身斗争。
    十月底至十一月初，湖南曾开过重点总结会议，从土改试验点中发现一些问题，其中最主要的是干部问题。到十二月份为止，湖南参加土改干部约有二万二三千人，每一乡约有二三十人。过去华北实行土改，每乡不过十来个干部，今天在数量上似乎不算少。但一则湖南农村范围大，人口多，居住分散，一个乡的人口约五千至八千人，大的乡有达一万三四千人的，工作不容易。二则土改干部中百分之九十三为新干部，而其成份又有百分之七八十是地主富农家庭出身的知识分子，百分之二三十是农民。他们参加革命工作的时间，最长的不过一年，最少的仅十天半月。老干部仅占百分之七、八，而且并不都是有土地改革工作经验的。第一批试点，干部共一千八百多人，其中仅七八十人为老干部，有土改经验者不过三十人，农民干部不过四五十人。在工作中发现许多新干部在政治上没有确立阶级感情，在方法上没有从群众要求出发，在土地改革路线上没有掌握深入发动贫雇农依靠贫雇农的方针，和平改革取消斗争的观念相当普遍。幸而领导机关发觉得早，适时地发出指示，打通干部思想，通过各种会议和斗争去教育启发农民，从十一月起就作了纠正和平改革倾向的努力。各级领导干部除一部分亲自下乡领导土地改革工作外，其余也经常到下面了解情况，随时发现和解决问题。这样，经过两个多月的一系列的指示、会议，批判和介绍了经验，湖南土地改革运动在反和平改革偏向中才提高了一大步。群众一般都有些发动，个别地方有很好的发动（如长沙县的黎托、西薮、金托、合平等乡，常德县的石板滩乡，岳阳县的筻口乡等）。经过减租、退押、反霸、反破坏、反隐瞒、清匪肃特等一系列的艰巨的斗争，农民觉悟提高了，农民队伍经过整顿有了进步，干部比较有了经验，和平土改思想有了纠正，依靠贫雇农团结中农的政策思想更明确了些。中共省委和省土地改革委员会的高级负责干部又到处检查了第一期的工作，抓紧在一九五一年初召开了会议，总结第一期试点一千个乡的经验，表扬了成绩，指出了缺点，介绍了好的经验，批评了坏的思想作风。对第二期土改的路线和具体作法，已经根据第一期的具体经验作了明确的决定，并要把这些决定贯彻到每一级的工作干部。我们无论从领导思想上和具体作法上去看，应该说湖南的土改运动是有了显著的成就的。在今后两个月内，湖南二千万人口的地区将进入反封建战斗的全面战斗。在正确的战略指导和战斗部署下，我们相信一定能够胜利地完成预期的任务。
            四、翻天覆地
    农民革命一起来，正如毛主席所说的：“其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量压抑不住。”今天湖南的农村，在“穷人翻身”“土地回老家”的口号下，已经有将近两千万人口转入在土地改革的大战斗中。虽说土地改革高潮尚未到来，但这一革命斗争的政治影响，已经通过第一期试点地区而相当普遍地传播了。我们随便走到一些农村，随便经过一些城镇，就可看见无数带着“民兵”红臂章的农民，拿起梭标、大刀或步枪，牵着不法地主去乡农会或区政府。夜晚到处有巡逻的民兵，严防匪特破坏电话线等活动。农村的大路上，成队的男女，欢欢喜喜地谈着话，讨论着问题。他们或她们不是查田，就是开会，不是斗地主，就是修塘坝，搞生产。“农民翻身万岁”“毛主席万岁”“中国共产党万岁”的大字标语，到处可以看见，《谁养活谁》《歌唱毛主席》的歌声，到处可以听见。田里到处树着标签，山边田坎到处在开荒生产。这说明湖南农村已开始显露一种新面貌：过去愁眉苦脸的穷人开始在抬头，在欢笑，在打着满怀信心的翻身仗；过去压榨农民血汗的地主阶级开始在低头，在叹气，在广大的农民面前发抖。旧社会里一向饥寒交迫的劳动人民，一向没有地位的被压迫阶层，今天个个扬眉吐气，开始被自己也被别人看作“人”；旧社会里一向席丰履厚的地主阶级，一向骑在人民头上作威作福的各色“土皇帝”，今天在农民的觉悟与打击之下，已经开始感觉失去了权势！就是这样的一种对照，显得湖南的农村是在“翻天覆地”了！在长沙西薮乡一个民兵同志和我闲聊，他说：“我死父亲那年还只十五岁，上有寡母，下有弟妹。自己田里工夫冒学好，狗婆养的保长又要抽我的壮丁，日本鬼子又时常来打捞。那时真是走头无路，一天搞不到一顿稀粥。如今搭帮毛主席，我们分了田，分了屋，过些时候还可娶个老婆，再也不挨那些王八地主的气了！老李，你真不晓得我们是多喜欢呵！”又有一个贫农李月楼告诉我，解放前白匪军一个排驻在他住的小学校，那个排长诬他是“匪特”，使他不敢落屋。就在那晚上狗排长跑进他老婆的房里要强奸她，她抵死不肯，裤子被撕破，头也被打伤，终于逃脱了虎口。他说：“想不到我如今做了组长，我老婆做了妇女委员，那些压迫我们穷人子的混蛋都给赶跑了！”从这些闲谈中不是清清楚楚地告诉我们农村的两个世界吗？在旧社会，农民不是人，从反动武装到保甲长，都是农民的压迫者；在新社会，农民当了家，一切反动派都倒下去了！我们参加过不少斗争地主的大会。当一个平日威风十足的恶霸地主被农民牵入群众大会举行诉苦斗争，当农民诉说他如何剥削穷人，如何欺压良善，如何夺佃夺妻谋财害命等勾当时，只要你尚有正义感，你就会很自然地站在农民一边，觉得“地主阶级是罪恶”不是一句过份的话了！
    自然，在翻天覆地的局面下，免不了要误伤一些人，也许“罚非其份”，也许“无辜受罚”，但这只是极少数的局部现象，就整个革命运动看，无宁是“在所难免”的。革命不是绣花或写文章，两千万人民真正起来了，要他们完全炉火纯青，丝毫不出差错，这是不可能的。我们只能尽一切可能，要求少出偏差，不出大偏差，出了偏差就纠正。而且，事实上，真正出自群众的斗争，只要不是干部“代替包办”或坏分子操纵的，十回有九回是“罚如其份”的，问题还是在深入发动群众，让群众自己掌握这个惩罚敌人的武器。地主阶级在翻天覆地的局面下倒了下去之后，免不了要叫喊一番，躲在城市里的逃亡地主或在意识上和地主一道的人，就会替这些叫喊当义务广播员。我们如果想不上当，最好亲自到乡下看了再发言。
            五、抗美援朝在农村
    随着反封建斗争的展开，农民的政治觉悟是日渐提高了。十一月间我们初下乡时，农民一听说我们来自远方，头一句就要问“毛主席他老人家可好？”第二句就要问到朝鲜的仗打得怎样？那时我们人民志愿军还未参战，美国强盗正在得意忘形的越过了三八线，侵占了平壤，美国飞机正在接二连三的轰炸我安东一带，农民关心朝鲜战局是很自然的。那时我们为了打击地主阶级和特务的造谣，为了纠正少数农民怕变天的思想，在配合土改宣传中我们展开了抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传。等到我人民志愿军一入朝鲜，果然“旗开得胜”，给美国侵略者一个下马威，扭转了朝鲜战局。接着中朝人民部队打了几个大胜仗，把整个朝鲜战争形势改观，平壤光复，长津湖大捷，追过三八线以南，光复汉城……，这一连串的巨大胜利，在农民中间造成了巨大的兴奋。农民的劲头一天天大起来，每天看黑板报，看城里寄来报纸的大字标题。和他们碰在一块，就要攀谈几句时局。一开会，他们就很自然地扯到朝鲜战事。譬如说：“现在美帝国主义纸老虎给我们戳穿了，麦克屙屎（农民用这个称呼表示他们对麦魔的愤怒）被我们中朝人民军打得落花流水，我们还怕地主、特务‘三次大战’‘老蒋回来’的谣言吗？”“只要毛主席坐北京，我们农民坐乡村（意即农民专政），管他什么美帝屁帝，包管打个稀烂！”农民的劲头一大，土改的问题就更好进行，地主阶级的反抗和造谣也就受了致命的打击。群众协助政府和公安机关在全省破获了不少的所谓“地下军”组织，政府也就抓紧机会实行了镇压反革命活动的方针，通过人民法庭、军法审判、和人民法院，将各种危害人民革命事业的反动匪特分子惩办一批。如是全省革命秩序更加稳固了。即向来以匪患著称的湘西和邵阳属的龙山一带，股匪也已基本肃清，匪首一一伏法。剩下的少数散匪，由于群众起来了无法藏匿，只好改邪归正，向人民政府自首。现在湖南治安和交通秩序之好，为近数十年所仅见。凡是在进行土改的乡村，赌博绝迹，歹人坏分子不敢多事，一切活动都集中在斗地主搞生产方面。一个活了七十多岁的老农民对我说：“我活到这大年纪，从冒见过这样的好世界，也冒见过这样的好解放军。”随着我人民志愿军在朝鲜的伟大胜利，农村中展开了“抗美援朝”运动，表现得最显著的一个例子就是翻身农民的参军狂热。我们在西薮乡分配土地后的第二天，就看见两个乡的农民队伍，用龙灯、民兵、和秧歌队，锣鼓喧天的欢送翻身青壮农民入伍。我们在由湘潭到湘乡邵阳的道路中，到处看见参军的农民队伍穿上新发的棉制服，高唱着《三大纪律八项注意》的歌子。单是邵阳一县，参军的就有八千多，农民们都懂得援朝就是保国，参军就是保卫胜利果实。杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、杜勒斯等战争贩子们听着，人民已经站起来了的新中国，是决不容许猪鼻子伸进人民的花园的！
            六、永远跟着毛主席
    湖南的农民在翻身的斗争中有一个最大的精神支持力，就是人民领袖毛主席和他所领导的中国共产党。农民们在开会或闲扯的时候，三句话就要谈到毛主席和共产党。我们在长沙榔梨区西薮乡工作的时候，乡农民协会主席林庆生，是个做了二十八年长工的雇农，不大识字，但极正派而会说话，在群众中的威信很高。他在第一次主持大会时，看见会场一片嗡嗡谈话声，会议不好进行，他便高声说道：“代表同志们！我里是个粗人，承大家抬举，选我当主席。如今土改快完，工作同志要调到别处去帮穷人翻身，我里的事要大伙自己来搞。我是第一次做这个主席，冒得麽子掌握。但毛主席他老人家的像在上头，看我里这样七嘴八舌，好意思吗？”经他这一说，会场立刻清静了，会议进行得很好。那天正是初步计划阶级，群众在他的主持之下，把划阶级的道理和地主名单作了研究，发言很踊跃，也蛮有秩序。我们坐在农民中间听，大家都说：“老林真行。”这件事固然说明老林懂得群众心理，同时也说明农民如何热爱人民的领袖！又有一个晚上，我在贫农老梁家里闲扯，外面正下着雪，我们烧茅柴烤火，他一家老少都在，我说：“老梁，我们快要走了，你还有麽子事谈谈吗？”他一面烧火一面正正经经地说：“老李，你回北京见到毛主席，千万带个拜上，说我里穷人子搭帮他老人家翻了身，有了田，不再受气挨饿，我里一定好好生产，好好管制地主坏分子，不要他老人家操心……”他一本正经地这样说，态度极其诚恳。坐在他旁边的老母亲说：“冒得他老人家作主，我里穷人子真不晓得何是搞呀！”我看见他母子这样的情绪，便答说：“拜上可以带到，你们也可写信给毛主席报告，毛主席是从不搭架子的。如果老梁努力生产，做了劳动模范，当选了劳模，还可上北京去见毛主席呢！”他说：“真要能见到毛主席就好了！”在乡一月，像这样的故事是很多的。农民中间最流行的两个歌子，一是《谁养活谁》，一是《歌唱毛主席》。农民多数在夜间开会，每当夜深会散，一群男女老少，为了减少走夜路的寂寞，不是扯问题就是拉歌子。年轻的农民喜欢向妇女们挑战，妇女也不示弱，一拉就大家唱起来了。歌声起处，此应彼和，打破了乡间午夜的沉寂。地主家里的狗，开头看见人影听见歌声就要狂吠一阵，久了也就睡他的窝去了。当你听到《永远跟着毛主席，跟着共产党》的歌声在一群多少年来没有过欢笑的农民中间唱出来时，你就自然地意识到这世界真是变了！
                           一九五一、一、十四、长沙。
