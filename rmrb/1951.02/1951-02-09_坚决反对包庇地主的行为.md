Today, this newspaper publishes news of Ge Feng, secretary of the Headquarters of the Preliminary Aviation School of the East China Air Force, openly harboring landlords and undermining land reform. This is worthy of attention by leading organs at all levels and every revolutionary worker. As the unprecedentedly large-scale land reform movement in Chinese history is being carried out in depth in the vast new areas such as East China and Central South China, profound and drastic changes are taking place in the rural societies of the new areas. This great change is eliminating the feudal landlord class in these areas and changing the semi-feudal nature of society in these areas. This change is also affecting, to varying degrees, those workers within the revolutionary ranks whose families are in land reform areas and who come from landlord families. Ge Feng's mistake is an example of this influence.

The error committed by Ge Feng is a matter of political stance. Because eliminating feudalism and the landlord class is one of the basic tasks of the New Democratic Revolution. Anyone who approves of the New Democratic Revolution must agree to eliminate the landlord class. There can be no ambiguity here. All revolutionary cadres can only stand on the side of the peasants in the relationship between landlords and peasants, and not on the side of the landlords. This is a fundamental principle, i.e., a question of revolution or counter-revolution.

When class struggle in the countryside is tense, the landlord class often uses people within the revolutionary ranks who have ambiguous stances to protect themselves and oppress the peasants. Ge Feng was one of those exploited by his uncle, Ge Wen'an. People like Ge Feng may verbally approve of land reform, but in reality, they oppose it. Such people are indifferent to the peasants' enthusiastic emancipation movement, but have unlimited sympathy for the small number of parasitic landlords in their families and relatives, and echo the landlords' clamoring. This is something absolutely intolerable in the revolutionary ranks.

Of course, Ge Feng's situation is not the only example in land reform areas. There are also some people who either write letters to local peasant associations or local governments, requesting that their families and relatives be taken care of; or request to lower the class composition of their families; or accept the enticements and bribes of landlords, and illegally intimidate peasants; or secretly help families or relatives to disperse and transfer property. For all these phenomena, governments and peasant associations at all levels must be vigilant and must carry out resolute struggles.

The Zhejiang Provincial Peasant Association's public exposure in the newspaper of Ge Feng's illegal behavior is entirely correct, and peasant associations everywhere should learn from this responsible spirit. This supports the just demands of the peasants on the one hand, and helps military and political organs to rectify the ideological style of their internal staff on the other hand. The experience of previous land reforms proves that one of the keys to successfully implementing land reform is to strictly prevent and correct the phenomenon of individual personnel within revolutionary organizations protecting landlords. Therefore, in the organs in land reform areas, as well as in all organs with staff from landlord families in land reform areas, education on land reform should be carried out in depth. After checking and finding erroneous thoughts and behaviors of staff members who oppose land reform, they should be criticized and punished separately. In this way, all cadres can be educated, wavering elements can be rescued, and degenerate elements can be punished. In this way, the Communist Party and the People's Government can completely stand together with the broadest masses of peasants and lead the peasant masses forward.

### 坚决反对包庇地主的行为

　　坚决反对包庇地主的行为
    今天本报发表的华东空军预科总队司令部秘书葛风公开包庇地主破坏土地改革的新闻，值得各级领导机关以及每一个革命工作人员注意。当着中国历史上规模空前宏大的土地改革运动在华东、中南等广大新区深入进行的时候，新区农村社会正发生深刻的激烈的变化。这一伟大的变化，正使这些地区的封建地主阶级趋于消灭，正改变着这些地区社会的半封建性质。这个变化，也在不同的程度上影响到革命队伍内部那些家在土地改革地区、出身于地主家庭的工作人员。葛风所犯的错误，就是这种影响的一个例子。
    葛风所犯的错误是关于政治立场的问题。因为，消灭封建主义，消灭地主阶级，是新民主主义革命的基本任务之一。一切赞成新民主主义革命的人，必须同意消灭地主阶级。这里不能有任何模糊。一切革命干部在地主与农民关系上，只能站在农民这一边，不能站在地主那一边。这是一个根本原则问题，即是革命还是反革命的问题。
    在农村阶级斗争紧张的时候，地主阶级常常利用革命队伍内部立场模糊的分子，来保护自己，压迫农民。葛风正是被他的伯父葛文安利用的一个。像葛风这样的人，他口头上也许赞成土地改革，实际上却反对土地改革。这样的人对农民热火朝天的翻身运动无动于衷，而对自己家庭亲友的少数寄生地主却抱着无限同情，对于地主的叫嚣随声附和。这是革命队伍中所绝对不能容许的事情。
    当然，像葛风这样的情形，在土地改革地区并不是唯一的例子。还有这样一些人，他们或者写信给当地农民协会或地方政府，要求照顾他们的家庭和亲属；或者要求降低家庭的阶级成份；或者接受地主的利诱收买，非法手段威吓农民；或者暗中帮助家庭或亲属分散转移财产。对于所有这些现象，各地政府和农民协会都必须提高警惕，并且必须进行坚决的斗争。
    浙江省农民协会在报纸上公开检举葛风的违法行为，是完全正确的，各地农民协会应当学习这种负责精神。这一方面支持了农民正义的要求，一方面也帮助了军政机关整顿自己内部工作人员的思想作风。历次土地改革的经验证明：顺利实现土地改革的关键之一，就是严格地防止和纠正革命组织内个别人员的袒护地主的现象。因此，在土地改革地区的机关，以及一切有土地改革区地主家庭出身的工作人员的机关，都应当深刻地进行土地改革的教育，在检查出工作人员中有反对土地改革的错误思想和错误行为以后，就要分别地加以批评和处分。这样，才能教育所有干部，挽救动摇分子，惩治堕落分子。这样，才能使共产党和人民政府与最广大的农民群众完全站在一起，并领导农民群众前进。
