　　On the Serious Errors in Books on the Theory and History of Economic Crisis
    A. Alekseev, I. Kozodoev, E. Rasutkin
    The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin made a brilliant study of the theory and history of economic crises of overproduction that periodically shake the capitalist economic system. The theory and history of crises, which have become an inseparable part of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, profoundly reveal the historical destiny of the capitalist mode of production and irrefutably prove that crises cannot be eliminated without eliminating capitalism.
    At the current stage of the intensification of the general crisis of capitalism, the task of elucidating the Marxist-Leninist theory and history of economic crises is particularly urgent. It is important to correctly demonstrate the causes of the crisis, its forms of expression, the maturity and development of crises in various countries, its role and destructive consequences, and thereby demonstrate the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat to eliminate the foundations of capitalism and create new socialist foundations, based on the Marxist-Leninist analysis of concrete historical materials. The work of Soviet economists in studying the capitalist economy and analyzing crises should be combative and offensive in nature, serving the cause of the proletariat's revolutionary struggle and the cause of democracy and socialism.
    Unfortunately, we have published very few books analyzing economic crises. Among the recent publications on the theory and history of crises, some contain serious errors that distort some of the most important principles of the Marxist-Leninist theory of capitalist reproduction and economic crises.
    The book "Economic Crisis and the 19th Century Cycle" by Professor R. A. Mendelson, published in 1949, is one such work.
    Comrade Stalin taught: "The root of the economic crisis of overproduction and its cause lies in the capitalist economic system itself. The root of the crisis lies in the contradiction between the social nature of production and the capitalist form of appropriation of the fruits of production. The contradiction between the enormous growth of production capacity on which capitalism relies to obtain the greatest capitalist profits, and the relative reduction of the solvency of millions of working people (capitalists always strive to keep their living standards at an extremely low level), is the expression of this fundamental capitalist contradiction."
    It is impossible to give a truly scientific explanation of the history of the crisis without revealing the development of the fundamental contradiction of capitalism. However, the analysis of the intensification of capitalist contradictions in the periodic development of capitalist production does not occupy a central position in Mendelson's book. The author generally talks about the causes of the crisis, citing the Marxist-Leninist principle that the renewal of fixed capital is the material basis of the cyclical nature of the crisis, but not its cause. But in analyzing specific crises, he does not reveal the root of the crisis itself, but focuses mainly on the material basis of the cyclical nature of the crisis. With this attitude, Mendelson cannot correctly explain the history of the crisis, and in fact gives an objectivist description of the movement of fixed capital in material form.
    For example, in the chapter on the crisis of 1890, he describes in detail the large-scale construction of railways, the growth of technology, the expansion of fixed capital in industry, etc., and regards the maturity of the crisis itself as the result of the large-scale expansion and speculation of fixed capital (pages 633-635). Just as when explaining the characteristics of other crises, the author is confused on the issue of the causes of the crisis and the cyclical nature of the crisis, and he separates the crisis from the basic contradiction of capitalism.
    The basic contradiction of capitalism – the contradiction between the social nature of production, and the private capitalist appropriation, and the contradiction between labor and capital arising therefrom, the contradiction between the desire for unlimited growth of production and the limitation of mass demand, etc. – Mendelson does not thoroughly and concretely demonstrate these, but describes the boom phase at length, without simultaneously revealing the true driving force of the boom, that is, the capitalist's pursuit of profit. When the author falls into the techno-economic description of capitalist growth, he gives the reader the mistaken concept that capitalism always plays a progressive role.
    The author's "ideas" are most clearly expressed in his description of the characteristics of the role played by monopoly capital.
    Leninism teaches that the rule of monopoly capital has brought the decadence and parasitism of capitalism to the extreme, monopoly capital is the fetter of the productive forces, hindering its development and using all its economic and political power to carry out unprecedented oppression of the masses. Lenin pointed out when explaining the characteristics of capitalism in the age of imperialism that capitalism "has matured and rotted. It is moribund. It has become the most reactionary obstacle hindering human development."
    The Leninist-Stalinist doctrine of imperialism makes it possible to understand more deeply the nature and characteristics of economic crises even in the pre-monopoly capitalist era. It is entirely impossible to correctly explain the economic crisis during the period when imperialism was sprouting and forming (1870-1900) without being guided by this doctrine.
    Mendelson ignores the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine of imperialism in the books discussing the history of crises up to the crisis of 1900-1903 (including this crisis). He excuses himself by saying that his work is a narrative of the crisis in the nineteenth century, saying: "This book does not study the crisis in the age of imperialism, so it is not possible to give a detailed narrative of Lenin's and Stalin's analysis of the crisis here" (page 11). Therefore, it is no wonder that the author incorrectly shows the role of monopoly capital in the development of productive forces.
    Based on the fact that monopoly capital possesses enormous economic power, he draws the conclusion of defending the bourgeoisie, insisting that "not only the tendency of stagnation and decay is inherent in monopoly capital, but also the potential possibilities of accelerating the advancement of productive forces" (page 717) are also unique to them. In this way, he attributes the increasing potential of productive forces to the further development of the increasingly decadent shell of productive forces – monopoly capital.
    Mendelson elaborates on the expansion of the production mechanisms of monopoly companies, emphasizing the so-called progressive role of monopoly capital in production development. He cites the American Steel Trust and the German electrical industry companies "Siemens & Halske" and "A.E.G." as examples to illustrate his own principle. At the same time, he did not reveal the heinous role of this monopoly capital in launching wars, in establishing unprecedented exploitation in society, in using criminal and political means of competition, in cruelly exploiting laborers, and so on.
    It is impossible to scientifically explain the history of the crisis without a Marxist analysis of the market problem. However, there is no such analysis in the book. Not only that, but the author also distorts the understanding of the reasons for the intensification of the market problem in the process of capitalist development. According to his assertion, the intensification of the market problem does not depend on the intensification of capitalist contradictions and the reduction of the purchasing power of millions of workers and peasants (who are the main buyers after all), but primarily depends on the so-called "huge increase in peaceful industrial production capacity..." (page 608). Therefore, it is no accident that the book does not adequately explain the increasing impoverishment of workers in capitalist countries and the suffocation and plunder of the people of the colonies by capitalist predators. The author only touches on the issue of wages, which is of the utmost importance to the history of the crisis under the capitalist system, only in passing.
    The main shortcoming of the book is that the author separates the crisis from the basic contradictions of capitalism, concealing the proletariat's struggle for a revolutionary way out of the crisis and to overthrow capitalism. The book rarely mentions the workers' movement, and even these mentions are only linked to the results of the crisis. In this book that we are criticizing, there is no space in more than eight hundred pages to give a Marxist-Leninist explanation of the proletarian revolutionary struggle, and to reveal the treacherous role of the opportunists – the bourgeoisie's lackeys in the workers' movement.
    Mendelson did not reveal the characteristics of the economic development of various countries, and did not point out the characteristics of the origin of the crisis in each country. He exaggerates the role of Britain and the United States in the economic development of other countries, and does not reveal the predatory nature of British and American capitalism. The author essentially denies the independence and characteristics of Russian capitalist development. He wrote that before the 1870s, the Russian economy merely reflected the crises of other countries (primarily Britain), which accelerated the development of Russian capitalism and large-scale production. Mendelson tried to belittle Russia's economic development, even saying that Russia's industrial transformation period was at the end of the 1890s.
    In the chapter on the crisis of 1900-1903, Mendelson discusses the issue of American capital exporting to other countries from an objectivist standpoint. According to his opinion, after American capital filled the continent, it accelerated the development of capitalism everywhere. At the same time, he did not point out that capital export greatly strengthens the exploitation, impoverishment and suffering of the laboring masses in colonies and dependent countries.
    When uncritically using bourgeois materials and forged statistics, Mendelson shows that he is influenced by bourgeois economists in many cases. The criticism of these things in the book has a liberal nature, and the author often describes conscious justification as "mistakes." Mendelson calls A. Yavtalion, an insignificant French bourgeois economist, a famous crisis researcher, and discusses him as if he were a colleague. He also "criticizes" the defender of imperialism, Hilferding, in the same tone. The author portrays the working class's mortal enemies, such as the bellicose fascist Sombart, as ostriches, as if they were comforting themselves with illusions, rather than fighting furiously to save capitalism.
    Mendelson's book was published under the editorship of Professor P.K. Figurnov. The errors in this book were not eliminated by the editor. This is also not accidental. There are also serious errors in Figurnov's own works on the crisis.
    For example, in the shorthand record of the public lecture "Marxist-Leninist Doctrine of Crisis" published in 1948, and in the booklet "Capitalist Reproduction and Economic Crisis" published in 1949, he tolerated a lot of confusion when expounding the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist doctrine on capitalist reproduction and crisis, abstracting this doctrine in a scholastic-philosophical manner without linking it to the modern era.
    In his booklet, Figurnov did not deeply and accurately show that the crisis of overproduction is an expression of the basic contradiction of capitalism in a violent and destructive form. Like Mendelson, he also evaded with generalizations and did not describe the increasing catastrophic impoverishment of the laboring masses under the current capitalist conditions. At the same time, the author emphasized the development of productive forces under capitalism, emphasizing "violent" technological progress, and writing things like the results of the crisis causing "full technological transformation" and so on.
    When talking about the changes in the capitalist cycle during the age of imperialism, Figurnov completely failed to show that during the period of the general crisis of capitalism, monopoly capital seeks a way out of the crisis of overproduction by launching wars and enslaving other countries.
    The author remained silent about the fact that the general crisis of capitalism has become more acute as a result of the Second World War, and that two opposing camps – the anti-democratic camp of imperialism headed by the United States and the anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union – have been formed. This booklet we are studying does not mention the struggle between the two systems at all, nor does it mention the existence of such a socialist system "growing, flourishing, opposing the capitalist system, and proving the decadence of capitalism and shaking the foundation of capitalism with its very existence" (Stalin's words).
    Figurnov did not show how the bourgeois state shifts the destructive consequences of the crisis onto the shoulders of the laboring masses. Not only that, at a public discussion he directly asserted that "under certain special circumstances and in the age of imperialism, the bourgeois state can play a certain degree of progressive (?!?) role" (emphasis added by the author of this article).
    Finally, the author did not show in his works how the crisis of overproduction affects the improvement of the workers' class consciousness, and did not emphasize the possibility and inevitability of a revolutionary way out of the crisis.
    It must be pointed out that Mendelson and Figurnov used erroneous methods when citing Marxist-Leninist classics. In many cases, the authors make erroneous annotations or quote out of context.
    As early as 1947-1948, our newspapers sharply criticized several books on modern capitalist economics (works by E. Varga, I. Trakhtenberg, S. Vishnev and U. Kaplan, etc.). The authors of these works made serious errors in explaining capitalist economics. They separated politics from economics, did not analyze capitalist economics from the political point of view of the class, but gave it a techno-economic description, thereby concealing the contradictions of modern capitalism.
    The exposure of the erroneous works that appeared at that time was of great significance for the struggle for Marxist-Leninist economics.
    It can be seen from the books of Mendelson and Figurnov that they repeated the errors of bourgeois objectivism.
    During the current period of the general crisis of capitalism, the antagonistic contradictions that are disintegrating the capitalist system are becoming more and more acute. Imperialists subject the people of colonies, dependent countries, and metropolises to unprecedented oppression and cruel exploitation, extracting huge profits from the suffering and blood of the people. The laboring people's hatred of imperialism is growing all over the world. In order to establish world hegemony, suppress workers and national liberation movements, and find a way out of the economic crisis, the gangster-like American imperialism is trying to launch a new world war, and is intensifying the fascistization and militarization of countries in the imperialist camp. The attempt of the imperialists to find a way out by inciting a new world war, from the expansion of military production, from the militarization and fascistization of countries dominated by capital, and from stifling democracy, shows the extreme parasitism and decay of capitalism.
    Works on the theory and history of the crisis, based on the brilliant Marxist-Leninist classics, should help readers understand more deeply the intensifying general crisis of capitalism, and clarify the tasks of progressive humanity in the struggle against imperialism and for peace, democracy, and socialism. These publications that we are now criticizing can only confuse readers.
    The question is, how did Mendelson's and Figurnov's books get published? This is because they were not widely discussed by the scientific community before they were published. The Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where the authors worked, did not carry out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, and did not establish a real creative environment sufficient to eliminate the appearance of such erroneous works.
    After Mendelson's and Figurnov's works were published, they were not criticized by the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and economic publications. The criticism of Mendelson's book published by V. Mikhailovsky, a worker at the Institute of Economics, in the magazine "Soviet Books" did not give a principled evaluation of this book. After pointing out individual errors in the book, Mikhailovsky praised it as a so-called "valuable contribution to our economic literature."
    Guided by Marxist-Leninist theory and the Leninist-Stalinist theory of imperialism, and carrying out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism among scientific workers, Soviet economists should creatively study the processes occurring in the modern capitalist economy, thereby helping our cadres to correctly and deeply analyze the international situation, and giving fraternal communist parties and workers' parties assistance in the cause of their cadres' Marxist-Leninist education.

　　论关于经济危机的理论与历史的书籍中存在的严重错误
    阿·亚历克塞也夫、伊·科佐多也夫、耶·拉苏特金
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，对于周期性摇撼着资本主义经济体系的生产过剩的经济危机的理论与历史曾作了天才的研究。成为马列主义学说不可分的一部分的危机理论与历史，深刻地揭露了资本主义生产方法的历史命运，无可辩驳地证明了：不消灭资本主义，危机是不可能消灭的。
    在资本主义总危机尖锐化的现阶段，阐明马列主义的经济危机理论与历史的这项任务，是特别迫切的。根据对具体历史材料的马列主义的分析，正确地表明危机的原因、其表现的形式、各个国家危机的成熟和发展、其作用和破坏性的后果，并就此表明无产阶级为消灭资本主义基础而创立新的社会主义基础的革命斗争，这是很重要的。苏维埃经济学家从事研究资本主义经济和分析危机的工作，应该具有战斗的进攻的性质，为无产阶级的革命斗争的事业服务，为民主和社会主义的事业服务。
    可惜我们所刊行的分析经济危机的书籍还很少。在近来出版的关于危机理论与历史的著作中，有些还含有严重的错误，它们歪曲了关于资本主义再生产和经济危机的马列主义理论中若干最重要的原理。
    一九四九年出版的鲁·阿·孟杰尔逊教授所著《经济危机与十九世纪周期》一书，便是这类的著作。
    斯大林同志教导说：“生产过剩的经济危机的根基和它的原因，就在于资本主义经济体系的本身。危机的根基就在于生产的社会性与生产成果的资本主义占有形式之间的矛盾。资本主义依靠获得最大的资本主义利润而来的生产能力的巨大增长，与千百万劳动大众（资本家总是竭力把他们的生活水准保持在极端低的程度上）的有支付能力的需要的相对缩减，这两者之间的矛盾，乃是这个资本主义基本矛盾的表现”。
    不揭露资本主义基本矛盾的发展，便不可能对危机的历史作真正科学的阐明。可是，对于在资本主义生产的周期性发展过程中资本主义矛盾尖锐化的分析，在孟杰尔逊的书中却未占据中心的地位。作者一般地谈到危机的原因，引证马列主义的原理，即固定资本的更新乃是危机周期性的物质基础，而不是它的原因。但在分析具体的危机时，他没有揭露危机自身的根基，却把主要的注意力放在危机周期性的物质基础上。以这样的态度，孟杰尔逊自然不能正确地阐明危机的历史，而且事实上对物质形态中的固定资本的运动作了客观主义的描述。
    例如，在论一八九○年的危机一章中，他详细描述铁路大规模的建筑，技术的增长，工业中固定资本的扩展等等，而且把危机的成熟本身看作是固定资本大规模扩展和投机的结果（六三三——六三五页）。恰如说明其他危机的特征一样，作者在危机的原因与危机周期性的原因两问题上陷于混乱，他把危机与资本主义的基本矛盾割裂开来。
    资本主义的基本矛盾——生产的社会性与私人的资本主义的占有之间的矛盾，以及由此产生的劳动与资本之间的矛盾，对生产无限增长的渴望与大众需求的局限性之间的矛盾等等——孟杰尔逊并不彻底地具体地表明这些，却冗长地描述高涨阶段，而没有同时揭露高涨的真正原动力，即资本家对利润的追逐。作者在落入对资本主义增长的技术经济的描述时，提给读者一种错误的概念，好像资本主义总是起着进步作用。
    作者的“观念”在他描述垄断资本所起作用的特点时，表现得最为明显。
    列宁主义教导说，垄断资本的统治使资本主义的腐朽性和寄生性达到了极点，垄断资本是生产力的镣铐，阻碍它的发展并且利用自己的一切经济和政治力量来对人民大众进行空前的压迫，列宁在说明帝国主义时期中资本主义的特征时指出，资本主义“已经成熟而烂熟了。它已是苟延残喘。它已成为阻碍人类发展的最反动的障碍”。
    关于帝国主义的列宁——斯大林学说，使有可能更深入了解即使是前垄断资本主义时代的经济危机的性质和特征。不以这个学说作指导而要正确地阐述帝国主义萌芽和形成时期（一八七○——一九○○年）的经济危机，是全然不可能的。
    孟杰尔逊就在论述直到一九○○——一九○三年危机（这次危机包括在内）的危机历史的书籍中，无视列宁斯大林的帝国主义学说。他托词他的作品是叙述十九世纪危机的，他说：“这本书对帝国主义时期的危机是不加以研究的，因而这里没有可能对列宁斯大林关于危机的分析也加以详细叙述”（一一页）。因此，无怪乎作者错误地表明垄断资本在生产力发展中的作用了。
    他由垄断资本拥有庞大的经济威力这一事实，作出为资产阶级辩解的结论，硬说什么“不仅停滞和腐朽的趋向是垄断资本所固有的，而且使生产力前进加速的潜在可能性”（七一七页）也是它们所特有的。他就这样将生产力的日益增大的潜在可能性，归因于生产力的日益腐朽的外壳——垄断资本——的进一步发展。
    孟杰尔逊详述垄断公司生产机构的扩大，强调所谓垄断资本在生产发展中的进步作用。他举美国钢铁托辣斯和德国电气工业公司“西门子与哈尔塞克”及“Ａ·Ｅ·Ｇ·”为例说明他自己的这个原理。同时，他却没有揭露这种垄断资本在发动战争上，在社会中确立空前的压榨上，在使用犯罪的和政治的竞争手段上，在残酷剥削劳动者上等等的凶恶作用。
    没有对市场问题作马克思主义的分析，便不可能科学地阐明危机的历史。可是书中却没有这样的分析。不仅如此，作者并歪曲了对于资本主义发展过程中造成市场问题尖锐化的原因的认识。依他的断言，市场问题的尖锐化，不是取决于资本主义矛盾的尖锐化与千百万工农大众（他们到底是主要的购买者）购买力的缩减，而是首先取决于所谓“和平工业生产能力巨大的增加………”（六○八页）。因此，书中对资本主义国家劳动者日益增长的贫困化以及殖民地人民受资本主义掠夺者的扼杀和掠夺都说明得完全不够并不是偶然的。关于在资本主义制度下对危机历史具有最重要意义的工资问题，作者只是顺便触及一下而已。
    书中的主要缺点就在于：作者使危机与资本主义的基本矛盾脱离，隐蔽无产阶级为了摆脱危机争取革命的出路、为推翻资本主义而进行的斗争。书中很少提到工人运动，就是这些提到的也只和危机的结果联结起来。在我们批评的这本书中，八百余页中却没有篇幅来对无产阶级革命斗争进行马列主义的说明，没有揭露机会主义者——资产阶级在工人运动中的走狗——的叛卖作用。
    孟杰尔逊没有揭露各个国家的经济发展的特性，没有指出各该国危机起源的特点。他夸大英美在其他各国经济发展中的作用，没有揭露英美资本主义的掠夺本性。作者在本质上否认俄国资本主义发展的独立性和特性。他写道，在七十年代以前，俄国的经济只不过是反映了其他国家（首先是英国）的危机而已，这些危机又加速了俄国资本主义及大生产的发展。孟杰尔逊力图小视俄国的经济发展，竟说俄国的工业变革期在十九世纪九十年代末。
    孟杰尔逊在论一九○○——一九○三年危机的一章中，以客观主义的立场论述美国资本向其他国家输出的问题，据他的意见，美国资本充斥大陆之后，便到处加速资本主义的发展。同时他却没有指出资本输出就是大大加强对殖民地和附属国劳动群众的剥削、穷困和苦难。
    在不加批判地利用资产阶级的资料和伪造的统计时，孟杰尔逊便在许多场合显示出受资产阶级经济学家的影响了。书中对这些东西的批评意见带有自由主义的性质，作者往往把有意识的辩解说成“错误”。把不足重视的法国资产阶级经济学家阿·亚夫塔利翁称为著名的危机研究者，孟杰尔逊像和同仁一样地和他进行讨论。他并以同样的语调“批评”帝国主义的辩护者希尔费丁。作者把工人阶级的不共戴天的敌人们，好战的法西斯分子松巴特之类，描画成驼鸟的样子，他们好像是以幻想自慰，而不是为挽救资本主义而进行狂暴的斗争。
    孟杰尔逊的书是在帕·卡·费古尔诺夫教授的编辑之下出版的。这本书的错误竟没有被编者消除。这也不是偶然的。在费古尔诺夫本人的论述危机的作品中也有严重错误。
    例如，在一九四八年发表的公开讲演速记稿“马列主义的危机学说”中，以及一九四九年出版的“资本主义的再生产与经济危机”单行本中，他在阐述马列主义的资本主义再生产与危机学说的基本原理时容忍不少的混乱，抽象——烦琐哲学的叙述这个学说而不与现代联系。
    费古尔诺夫在他这个单行本中没有深刻而确切地表明，生产过剩的危机乃是资本主义基本矛盾在猛烈的破坏性的形式中的表现。他也和孟杰尔逊一样地以笼统的来逃避，对于在当前资本主义条件下劳动大众日益增长的灾难性贫困化没有加以描述。同时，作者却强调在资本主义下生产力的发展，强调“猛烈的”技术进步，写出一些什么危机的结果造成“充分的技术变革”等等之类的话来。
    说到帝国主义时期资本主义周期的变更问题时，费古尔诺夫完全没有表明，在资本主义总危机时期垄断资本从发动战争、奴役其他国家来寻求生产过剩危机的出路。
    作者闭口不谈由于第二次世界大战的结果资本主义总危机更加尖锐起来了，两个对立的阵营——以美国为首的帝国主义的反民主阵营与以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主阵营形成了。在我们研究的这本小册子中丝毫也没有说到两个体系的斗争，没有说到“日益生长，欣欣向荣，与资本主义体系相对立，而且以其存在这一事实本身证明资本主义的腐朽性并摇撼资本主义的基础”（斯大林语）这样的社会主义体系的存在。
    费古尔诺夫没有表明，资产阶级的国家如何把危机毁灭性的后果转嫁到劳动大众的肩上。不仅如此，在一次公开讨论上他竟直截了当地断言，说什么“在一定的特殊的情况下和在帝国主义时期，资产阶级国家能起某种程度的进步（！？）作用”（着重点是我们加的——本文作者）。
    最后，作者在他的著作中没有表明，生产过剩的危机怎样影响工人的阶级意识的提高，没有着重指出危机的革命出路的可能性和必然性。
    不能不指出，孟杰尔逊与费古尔诺夫引用马列主义经典作品时的错误方法。作者在许多场合都对引文加以错误的注释或断章取义。
    早在一九四七——一九四八年，我们的报纸上就曾对若干论述现代资本主义经济的书籍（耶·瓦尔加、伊·特拉赫丁堡、斯·维什涅夫和乌·卡普兰等的著作）作了尖锐的批评。这些著作的作者在阐述资本主义经济时犯了严重的错误。他们把政治与经济割裂开来，不用阶级的政治观点去分析资本主义经济，而是给以技术经济的描述，因而隐蔽了现代资本主义的矛盾。
    对于那时出现的错误著作的揭露，对于为马列主义经济学的斗争具有巨大的意义。
    从孟杰尔逊与费古尔诺夫的书籍中可以看出，他们重犯了资产阶级客观主义性质的错误。
    在当前资本主义总危机时期，使资本主义制度分崩离析的相互敌对的矛盾越来越尖锐了。帝国主义者使殖民地、附属国以及宗主国的人民大众受到空前的压迫和残酷的剥削，从人民的痛苦和鲜血中榨取巨额利润。劳动者对帝国主义的仇恨在全世界各地都日益增长起来。为了建立世界霸权、镇压工人和民族解放的运动，为了寻找经济危机的出路，强盗式的美国帝国主义力图发动新的世界大战，加紧帝国主义阵营内各国的法西斯化和军国主义化。帝国主义者从煽动新的世界战争，从军事生产的膨胀，从受资本支配的各国的军国主义化和法西斯化，从窒息民主去寻找出路的这种企图，表现着资本主义的极端寄生性与腐朽性。
    基于天才的马列主义经典著作的、关于危机的理论与历史的著作，应该帮助读者更深刻地了解日益加剧的资本主义总危机，以及阐明进步人类在反对帝国主义，争取和平、民主及社会主义的斗争中的任务。现在我们所批评的这些出版物却只能使读者迷惑。
    试问孟杰尔逊与费古尔诺夫的书怎么会出版的呢？这是因为它们在出版之前没有经过广泛的科学界的讨论。作者工作的地方苏联科学院经济研究所，就没有开展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，没有建立起足以消除此类错误作品出现的真正的创作环境。
    孟杰尔逊与费古尔诺夫的作品在发表以后，也没有受到苏联科学院经济研究所以及经济刊物的批评。经济研究所工作者佛·米哈列夫斯基在“苏联书籍”杂志上发表的对孟杰尔逊的书的批评，也没有对这本书给以原则性的评价。在指摘书中个别错误后，米哈列夫斯基把它赞扬成所谓“对我们经济文献的宝贵贡献”。
    以马列主义学说、列宁斯大林的帝国主义理论作指导，在科学工作者中间开展布尔什维克的批评与自我批评时，苏维埃经济学家应该创造性地研究现代资本主义经济所发生的过程，因而帮助我们的干部正确而深刻地分析国际形势，在其干部的马列主义教育的事业上给予各兄弟共产党和工人党以帮助。（译自一九五○年九月廿九日真理报）
