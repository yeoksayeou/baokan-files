　　【News from this newspaper】As the Spring Festival approaches, Beijing, North China, and Central and Southern regions have universally launched activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs.

　　The Beijing Spring Festival Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Families Committee was established on February 1st, and sub-committees were established in each district. The Beijing Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Families Committee also decided that February 6th to February 20th (i.e., the first to fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year) would be the Beijing Spring Festival Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Families Campaign Bi-weekly. The government has allocated 530,000 catties of preferential grain to be distributed to poor families of revolutionary armymen, martyrs, and workers before the Spring Festival. A portion of this will be used to purchase pork, beef, and mutton to be distributed to 19,153 families of revolutionary armymen, martyrs, and workers throughout the city. Families with one or two people will receive one catty of pork, families with three or four people will receive two catties, and families with five or more people will receive three catties. To show special care for families of martyrs, families of meritorious personnel, veterans of the second class or higher, and families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea, the above standards will be increased by one person's worth. On February 5th, the units within the Municipal Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Families Committee will organize two慰问delegations to visit the Ditian Sanatorium and the Army Hospital to慰问the wounded and sick soldiers. During this period, districts will also hold army-civilian get-togethers and symposiums, hold Spring Festival group worships, celebrate victories, present silk banners, and commend production models. In addition, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Municipal Federation of Students will organize a joint celebration garden party.
