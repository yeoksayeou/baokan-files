　　East China Volunteer Language Work Team Departs for Korea
　　In order to educate the American prisoners of war on the Korean front, forty-four students from the English class of the Foreign Language Training School attached to the East China Revolutionary University formed a volunteer language work team to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. They left Shanghai on the evening of the 10th to work on the Korean front. Most of the team members are graduates of universities such as St. John's and Soochow. They firmly stated that they would fight against the U.S. imperialist aggressors by educating American prisoners of war! Wang Mengli, a graduate of Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, said: "Resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the duty of every Chinese person." Before the team's departure, the East China Military and Political Committee, East China Revolutionary University, and the Foreign Language Training School held send-off meetings.
