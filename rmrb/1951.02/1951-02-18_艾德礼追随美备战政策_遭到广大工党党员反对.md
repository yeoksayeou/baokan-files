　　Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: The strong opposition of broad Labor Party members in Britain to the Attlee government's pursuit of an aggressive war preparation policy following the United States was sharply exposed during the foreign policy debate held in the British House of Commons from the 12th to the 14th.

　　As early as January, according to a France-Presse dispatch from London: More than forty opposition members of Parliament appeared in the Labor Party parliamentary group, "accusing the government of pursuing a policy of following the United States - mainly supporting the U.S. proposal at Lake Success, condemning Communist China as an aggressor." They also opposed arming West Germany and "worried about the consequences of rearmament on the British standard of living." Therefore, according to Agence France-Presse: "The British Labor Party's test has entered a critical stage." Prior to this debate, twenty-nine Labor Party members jointly submitted three criticisms of the government's foreign policy in the House of Commons, opposing the government's support for the U.S.-manipulated United Nations position that smeared China as an "aggressor," opposing the government's support for the U.S. to force North Atlantic countries to agree to the Brussels resolution to arm West Germany, and demanding an end to the war in Asia and a halt to the arms race.

　　In this situation, according to a Reuter dispatch: Attlee himself "expressed significant anger at the widespread opposition to the government's gradual slide towards war," and had to personally come forward at the beginning of the debate on the 12th to defend his policies and intimidate and suppress the opposition. In his speech, Attlee shamelessly blamed "the root cause of world tension" on "the massive army maintained by the Soviet Union"; he shamefully defended U.S. aggression and unreasonably accused "some people, poisoned by propaganda, of believing that the United States is the aggressor in the Far East."

　　However, Attlee's speech not only failed to quell but instead aroused more opposition. The speeches in the House of Commons debate reflected this situation. Labor MP Hughes fiercely attacked the government's policy. He said: "I am completely opposed to the British military program." He also said: "Re-arming Germany will restore the entire German militarist apparatus." Another MP, Fletcher, said: "The government must recognize one thing - that millions of people will not forget the horrors of the Nazis in the last war." Even right-wing Labor MP Bowles declared: "So far, it has never been determined that Germany has a real need to rearm." Men and women who lost loved ones in the last war are very angry about this; "re-arming Germany is an insult to people all over the world who fought against the Nazis."

　　TASS London, February 14th, pointed out: A noteworthy aspect of the debate in the British House of Commons on foreign affairs is that many Labor MPs who usually firmly support the government have expressed extreme concern about the plan to rearm Germany. Even the Liberal Party's News Chronicle had to admit: "Examining the activities of a group of Labor MPs protesting against the plan to arm Germany in the House of Commons," it can be seen that the number of people criticizing the government is greater than people imagine.

### 艾德礼追随美备战政策  遭到广大工党党员反对

　　艾德礼追随美备战政策  遭到广大工党党员反对
    【新华社十七日讯】英国广大工党党员对艾德礼政府追随美国奉行侵略备战政策的强烈反对，在英国下院十二日至十四日举行的外交政策辩论中，尖锐地暴露了出来。
    早在一月份，据法新社伦敦电透露：工党国会党团中即出现了四十多个反对派议员，“指责政府奉行追随美国的政策——主要的是在成功湖支持美国提案，谴责共产党中国为侵略者。”他们也反对武装西德，并“担心重整军备对英国生活水准所引起的后果。”因此，据法新社称：“英国工党的考验顷已进入危急阶段。”而在这次辩论以前，工党二十九名议员又分别在下院联名提出三项批评政府的外交政策，反对政府支持美国操纵联合国通过诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的立场，反对政府支持美国强迫北大西洋国家同意武装西德的布鲁塞尔决议，要求结束亚洲战争，停止军备竞赛。
    在这种情形下，据电通社指出：艾德礼本人“对广泛反对政府逐渐走向战争的情形，表示了显著的愤怒”，而不得不于十二日辩论开始时亲自出马，为自己的政策辩护，并对反对者施行恫吓和镇压。艾德礼在其发言中无耻地把“世界局势紧张的根源”，诬赖为是“由于苏联所保持的庞大军队”；他可耻地为美国的侵略辩护，无理地指责“有些人，中了宣传的毒，竟相信美国是远东的侵略者。”
    但是，艾德礼的演说不但没有平息，而且反而激起了更多的反对。下院辩论的发言反映了这种情况。工党议员休士猛烈攻击政府政策。他说：“我完全反对英国的军备计划。”他又说：“重新武装德国，将使整个德国军国主义的机构恢复起来。”另一个议员福莱彻说：“政府必须认识到一件事——千千万万的人民是不会忘记纳粹在上次大战中的恐怖罪行的。”甚至右翼的工党议员鲍尔斯也宣称：“迄今为止，从未判明德国有重新武装的真正必要”，在上次大战中失去亲人的男女对此非常愤怒；“重新武装德国对于全世界曾和纳粹作战的人们是一种侮辱。”
    塔斯社伦敦十四日电指出：英国下院关于外交问题的辩论有一种值得注意的情况，那就是许多平常坚决支持政府的工党议员，都对于重新武装德国的计划表示极端忧虑。甚至自由党的新闻纪事报都不得不承认：“研究一下一群抗议武装德国计划的工党议员在下院中进行的活动”，就可以知道批评政府的人的数目比人们想像的为多。
