How to Consolidate Workers' Spare-Time Schools?
    ——Experience of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant Workers' Spare-Time School in Chahar
    Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Cultural and Educational Department
    The workers' spare-time school of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant in Xuanhua, Chahar Province, has not collapsed since its establishment on March 2nd last year. Currently, the number of participants accounts for 96.8% of the total number of employees in the plant. The students' enthusiasm remains high, and the attendance rate consistently stays above 72%. Since the study time was changed to mornings in July last year, there has not been a single absence without a valid reason.

    The Xiahuayuan Power Plant's spare-time school is divided into five types of classes: elementary, higher elementary, junior high, workers' family members, and technical classes. The textbooks used are entirely those compiled by the Beijing Workers' Spare-Time Education Committee. The elementary classes use volumes one to three, the higher elementary class uses volume one of the higher elementary textbook, with a weekly writing exercise. The junior high class was established in early September, with courses mainly focusing on trigonometry, algebra, physics, and chemistry. The technical classes are divided into turbine, electrical, boiler, and engineering drawing classes, based on the nature of the work and working hours. Because the teachers' lectures are closely linked to practical applications, the employees' enthusiasm for learning is very high, and no one is absent from class. The workers' family members class was established a month ago. Most students in Class A can recognize and write 100 to 150 characters, and most in Class B can recognize and write 80 to 90 characters. According to statistics from the literacy achievement test of 155 students participating in cultural studies, the literacy achievements are as follows: (1) The largest number of students, accounting for 29.7% of the total, are those who have learned to recognize 400 to 500 new characters from being illiterate or semi-literate; followed by those who have learned to recognize 200 to 300 characters, accounting for 23.9% of the total; those who have learned to recognize 800 to 900 characters account for 11.5%; those who have learned to recognize more than 1,000 characters account for 12.9%, and those who have learned to recognize 150 to 200 new characters account for 12%.

    The workers' spare-time school of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant has demonstrated the following characteristics in its work process: (1) The Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League have consistently adhered to the State Council's directive to "develop workers' spare-time education," ensuring workers' spare-time learning time. Cultural classes study for one hour every morning from 7:00 to 8:00, guaranteeing five hours of study per week. Workers' family members classes study from 2:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon, six hours per week. The technical classes schedule study time according to the three-shift work system: from 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning, 4:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon, and Sundays are entirely dedicated to technical class time. The leadership regards workers' spare-time learning as an integral part of their regular work, using every meeting and work arrangement opportunity to carry out publicity and mobilization, thus promoting the active participation of Party members, Youth League members, and activists in leading the learning. Wen Hong, the leader of the electrical class and a Party member, was previously illiterate. Every time the administration issued him a notice, he couldn't even find his own name. In the past six months of learning, he has attended class on time every day without missing a single session and has already learned to recognize more than 200 characters, playing a significant role in promoting mass learning. (2) The cultural and educational committee members are able to provide in-depth leadership, adhere to the system, and help solve practical problems. The cultural and educational committee members insist on implementing various disciplinary systems formulated after discussions with the students, such as monthly tests and quarterly awards. There are two methods of awarding prizes: one is based on the monthly test scores to reward those with good performance. In order to win awards, some students with higher proficiency run to lower grades, so that students with lower proficiency, although they work very hard and make good progress, cannot get awards. To remedy this shortcoming, a democratic award evaluation method is also implemented. The reward items are mainly notebooks, diaries, pencils, erasers, etc. Because the two awarding methods are implemented simultaneously, although they are graded, most students can at least get a pencil. At the grand award ceremony, the role models are fully invited to speak, explaining the importance of learning and correcting learning biases, which has a great effect. (3) The workers' spare-time education committee plays a relatively significant role: First, it organizes teaching research meetings, attended by the study committee, cultural and educational committee members, and all teachers, holding a weekly seminar to specifically study teaching methods and students' learning emotions. Second, it divides the entire group of students into seven groups, improving the system of weekly group learning review meetings. Each time the review meeting is held, the teachers and cultural and educational committee members personally go deep into the groups to participate in the discussions, discover problems, discuss and study them together, and help solve them specifically. The third is to insist on publicity and mobilization and commendation work in learning. Typical materials discovered in weekly review meetings, materials with excellent results in tests, and good materials discovered at any time in learning are promptly praised through big-character posters, blackboards, and amplifiers, greatly encouraging the employees' learning enthusiasm. (4) The teachers' work is done relatively well: First, teacher awards are insisted upon, also held quarterly; second, the cultural and educational committee strengthens the leadership and assistance to the teachers, such as jointly participating in group learning discussion meetings every week, and taking the discovered problems to the teaching research meeting to specifically study and solve them, thus giving play to the teachers' initiative. The teachers guarantee to the students "Not to delay a minute of class!" The students also unanimously feel that "The teachers are enthusiastic and responsible," so no one is willing to be late.

    Several experiences and lessons: (1) The concrete insistence of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League on implementing the State Council's directive on developing workers' spare-time education is the prerequisite for running workers' spare-time education well; (2) The cultural and educational committee members insisting on the system, providing in-depth leadership, concretely helping solve problems, improving the organization of the workers' spare-time education committee and group review meetings, doing a good job in the teachers' work, and giving play to the teachers' initiative are the keys to running workers' spare-time schools well; (3) It is necessary to extract one or two hours a week from cultural learning to conduct current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea, because combining it with current affairs and policy education can clarify certain erroneous ideas among students without delaying cultural learning. Some individual factories and mines have completely stopped workers' spare-time cultural learning in order to carry out a concentrated effort on current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea, which is inappropriate. (4) Teachers must fully prepare their lessons and must insist on the "four abilities" - the learning principles of being able to recognize, write, speak, and use. Some employees are still "able to recognize but not able to write," which is worth checking and correcting.

　　怎样巩固职工业余学校？      
    ——察哈尔下花园发电厂职工业余学校经验
    察哈尔省总工会文教部
    察哈尔省宣化下花园发电厂的职工业余学校，自去年三月二日成立后，没垮过。现在参加学习人数占全厂总人数的百分之九十六点八，学员情绪始终饱满，出席率经常在百分之七十二以上。自去年七月份把学习时间改到早晨后，到现在没有一个无故旷课的。
    下花园发电厂的业余学校，共分为初小、高小、初中、工属、技术五种班次，教材完全采用北京职工业余教育委员会编的课本。初小班用的是一至三册，高小班用的是高小第一册，每周有一次写作练习。初中班是九月初成立的，课程主要是三角、代数、理化。技术班是按工作性质和工作时间，分成汽机、电气、锅炉、工程画四班。由于教员讲课能结合实际，职工学习情绪很高，上课时没有一个不到课的。工属班成立一个来月，甲班学员大部分即能认会一百到一百五十字，乙班大部分认会了八十到九十个字，据一百五十五个参加文化学习的学员成绩测验统计，识字成绩如下：（一）由文盲半文盲认会四百到五百个生字的学员最多，占全体学员百分之二十九点七；认会二百字到三百个生字的学员次之，占全体人数百分之二十三点九；认会八百到九百个生字的学员，占百分之十一点五；认会一千字以上的学员占百分之十二点九，认一百五十个生字到二百个生字的学员占百分之十二。
    下花园发电厂的职工业余学校在工作过程中，表现了以下几个特点：（一）党、政、工、团一致坚持了政务院“开展职工业余教育”的指示，保证了职工业余学习时间。文化班每天早晨七时到八时学习一小时，每周保证学习五小时。工属班每天午后二时到三时，每周学习六小时。技术班按三班轮流工作制规定学习时间：每天午前八时到九时、午后四时到五时、星期日全是技术班上课时间。领导上把职工业余学习工作当成自己经常工作的一部分，利用一切会议和布置工作的机会，进行宣传动员，因此推动了党团员积极分子带头学习。电气班长温洪是个党员，过去一个大字不识，每次行政上给他下通知时，他连自己的名字都找不到。在这半年多的学习中，他每天按时上课，没有缺过一次课，已认会了二百多生字，对群众学习起了很大推动作用。（二）文教委员能够深入领导，坚持制度，帮助具体解决问题，对经过学员讨论后订出的各种纪律制度，文教委员都能坚持执行，如每月进行一次测验，三个月进行一次奖励等制度。奖励的办法有两种：一是根据每月考试分数对成绩好的进行奖励。为了得奖，有些程度高的学员往低年级跑，使程度低的学员虽然平时非常努力，进步也不小，但得不到奖。为了补救这个缺点，同时又实行了民主评奖的办法。奖励物品主要是笔记本、日记本、铅笔、橡皮等。由于两种奖励办法同时实行，虽然是分等级的，但大部分学员起码都能得到一枝铅笔。在隆重的给奖大会上，叫模范充分讲话，说明学习的重要，纠正学习偏向，作用很大。（三）职工业余教育委员会比较起作用：首先组织了教学研究会，由学习委员、文教委员、全体教员参加，每周末开一次座谈会，专门研究教学方法和学员学习情绪问题。其次，把全组学员划成七个小组，健全了每星期一次小组学习检讨会的制度。每次开检讨会时，教员和文教委员亲自深入小组参加讨论，发现问题，共同讨论研究，具体帮助解决。再次是坚持了学习中的宣传鼓动和表扬工作，每周检讨会中发现的典型材料，测验中成绩优良的材料，在学习中随时发现的好材料，都及时的用大字报、黑板报、扩大器进行表扬，大大鼓舞了职工的学习情绪。（四）教员工作做的比较好；第一，坚持了教员评奖，也是每三个月进行一次评奖；第二，文教委员会加强了对教员的领导帮助，如每周共同参加小组学习讨论会，发现的问题拿到教学研究会去具体研究解决，因此发挥了教员的积极性。教员向学员保证“不误一分钟课！”学员也一致感到“教员热心负责”，这样谁也不愿迟到。
    几点经验教训：（一）党、政、工、团具体坚持贯彻政务院开展职工业余教育的指示，是办好职工业余教育的前提条件；（二）文教委员坚持制度，深入领导，具体帮助解决问题，健全职工业余教育委员会的组织和小组检讨会，作好教员工作，发挥教员的积极性，是办好职工业余学校的关键；（三）每周从文化学习中抽出一两小时来进行抗美援朝的时事教育是必要的，因为结合时事、政策教育，可以澄清学员中某些错误思想，又不会耽误文化学习。有个别厂矿为了突击抗美援朝的时事教育，完全停止了职工业余文化学习，这是不妥当的。（四）教员必须充分准备功课，必须坚持“四会”——会认、会写、会讲、会用的学习原则。职工中现在仍有些人“会认不会写”，这是值得检查纠正的。
