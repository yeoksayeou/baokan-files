    Shenjiamen Fishermen Laughing During the Spring Festival
    Lin Jiefu
    "Three mountains, six seas, one-tenth of farmland," is an old saying that best describes the abundant "promise" in the sea around the Zhoushan Islands, the fishing center of our country. Last year, Shenjiamen port in Dinghai County produced 600,000 dan of large yellow croaker, 200,000 dan of small yellow croaker, 200,000 dan of flounder, 400,000 dan of reeves shad, 400,000 dan of hairtail, and 400,000 dan of jellyfish. As for other aquatic products like eel, crab, and shrimp, they are too numerous to count. But in previous years, fishermen were driven to desperation by creditors at the end of the year. But now? The fishermen are happily and intensively repairing their boats and mending their nets, preparing to go out fishing in the spring season, striving for another bumper harvest this year.

    The fishermen will never forget the suffering during the past reactionary rule. For many years, the fishing grounds were ravaged by foreign warships. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese warships flying the sun flag, and before liberation, American warships flying the Stars and Stripes, scattered the "fish shoals" and overturned fishing boats. The fishermen dared not say a word. When "returning to port," there were three hands reaching out for money: The first hand was the reactionary government, demanding sea patrol donations, fishing taxes, conscription grain, and all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies; the second hand was the feudal exploiting fish merchants (who had evil power), who collected fish at sea, with speculators controlling the scales, commonly calling 150 jin as 100 jin, and even taking commissions on this 100 jin at "double eight" (i.e., calculating as 88 jin), so the fishermen would lose 62 jin after just one weighing; the third hand was the "Chang Yuan" (i.e., the fishing boss), who took all the by-products such as shrimp, crab, miscellaneous fish, known as "taking fish soup," and in addition to retaining a legitimate share of the main products such as yellow croaker, also took a share for the god of wealth, an insurance share, and even a share for opera performances. Under super-economic exploitation, the fishermen could not even get enough to eat for three meals, and their wives were forced into prostitution (Shenjiamen had the most prostitutes), living a miserable and dark life. When the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated, the fishermen's lives were even more on the verge of desperation: Long-term blockades caused the fish they caught to rot and stink, and they still had to do construction work for the Kuomintang bandit troops while starving. When the bandit troops fled, they kidnapped more than 10,000 strong young men. Therefore, at the time of liberation, there was not a single fishing sail to be seen on this vast fishing ground.

    But the People's Government brought warmth to the fishermen, organized a fishing loan committee, and issued huge loans of 3 billion yuan, solving the fishermen's difficulties and enabling "big pairs," "small pairs," "big angling," and "small angling" to catch up with the fishing season and go to sea to fish.
    The fishing loan was followed by a bumper harvest, which had not happened in many years. Fisherman Shi Anding caught more than 30 dan in one haul, Fang Shenglai caught more than 60 dan in one haul, Zhuang Jin'an was the "champion" of fishing, catching more than 70 dan in one haul, and even ordinary fishermen caught more than 10 dan, while in previous years, 10 dan was considered the most. The Ningbo Special Zone estimated that the output for 1950 would be 16,599 tons, but by October it had already exceeded the estimate, with an output of 29,850 tons. "Why is there such a bumper harvest?" The fishermen told me: Since ancient times, only Chairman Mao has liberated the fishing grounds, and there are no more foreign warships running rampant, so the fish are in schools, and they are all caught in one net.
    The benefits of liberating the fishing grounds and the bumper harvest are endless. With the support of the Zhoushan Office of the East China Aquatic Products Bureau of the People's Government, last year the fish prices were particularly good. One dan of large yellow croaker could be exchanged for one dan of rice, whereas in the past it often took two dan of fish to exchange for one dan of rice, or even three or four dan. At the same time, the fishing system has also changed, and the three hands of exploitation are gone. Now, legitimate merchants only take 10 percent profit from the buyers, and the "Chang Yuan" system has also been abolished. For example, the Minbang "small angling" has a total of three fishermen, divided into five shares, with the three fishermen having three shares, the boat having one share, and the net having one share, belonging to the fishing boss. Most of the fish caught belongs to themselves, which the fishermen had never dreamed of before, but now it has come true.
    Now there is not a single unemployed fisherman in Shenjiamen, and the fishermen are all happily spending their first Spring Festival after liberation.

### 在春节中欢笑的沈家门渔民

　　在春节中欢笑的沈家门渔民
　　林节夫
    “三山，六海，一分田”，这是描写我国渔业中心舟山群岛海中的“出息”最多的一句古话。定海县沈家门港去年年产大黄鱼六十万担，小黄鱼二十万担，比目鱼二十万担，鳓鱼四十万担，带鱼四十万担，海蜇四十万担，其余鳗、蟹、虾等水产，更是数也数不清。但往年渔民在年底，却被债主逼得走头无路。现在呢？渔民们正在高高兴兴地加紧地修船、补网，准备春汛出渔，争取今年还要来个丰收。
                    ×            ×            ×
    过去反动统治时期的痛苦，渔民们是永远也不会忘记的。多少年来，鱼场被外国军舰蹂躏着，抗日战争前挂着太阳旗的日本军舰，解放战争前挂着星条旗的美国军舰，把“鱼脚”都赶散了，把渔船撞翻了，渔民那里敢说一句话。“回洋”来就有三只手伸过来要钱：第一只手是反动政府要巡海捐、渔税、壮丁谷、及一切苛捐杂税；第二只手是封建剥削的渔商（他们有恶势力），在海上收鱼，由投机商执秤，一百五十斤喊一百斤是常例，而这一百斤还要按“双八”取佣（即算作八十八斤），渔民在一秤之后，要吃亏六十二斤；第三只手是“长元”（即渔东），副产品如虾、蟹、什鱼、全归“长元”所有，俗名“拿鱼羹”，正产品如黄鱼等，除“长元”留了正当股份外，另外还要财神股、保险股，连唱戏也要一股。在超经济剥削下，渔工三顿饭也吃不饱，妻子被迫卖淫（沈家门娼妓最多），过着悲惨黑暗的日子。当国民党匪军撤退前后，渔民们生活更是濒于绝境：长期的封港，打来的鱼，放在那里烂了，臭了，还要饿着肚子给国民党匪军做工事。在匪军逃跑的时候，又被绑走了一万多壮年人。因此解放时，这一片广大的渔场上，看不到一只捕鱼的帆影。

    但是人民政府给渔民们带来了温暖，组织了渔贷委员会，发放了三十亿巨额贷款，解决了渔民的困难，使“大对”、“小对”、“大钓”、“小钓”都赶上了鱼汛期下海捕鱼。
    渔贷后接着就是丰收，这是多少年来所没有的。渔民施安定一风捕了三十多担，方圣来一风捕了六十多担，庄金安是捕鱼“状元”，一风捕了七十多担，普通的也有十多担，而往年十多担的产量就算最多的了。宁波专区预计一九五○年的产量是一六，五九九吨，但截至十月份就超过了预计数，已有产量二九、八五○吨。“为什么能够丰收呢？”渔民们告诉我：自古以来，只有毛主席解放了渔场，再没有横冲直撞的外国兵舰，鱼都是成群的，一网下去就都捉了。
    解放了渔场，丰收后的好处还是说不完的。在人民政府华东水产局舟山办事处扶助下，去年鱼价特别俏利，大黄鱼是一担鱼换一担米，而过去常常是二担鱼换一担米，甚至有三四担换一担米的。同时捕鱼的制度也改变了，三只剥削的手没有了。现在正当商人只向买户方面取百分之十利润，“长元制”也取消了，如闽帮“小钓”，共有三个渔工，分为五股，三个渔工三股，船一股，网一股，归渔东。捕来的鱼大部都是自己的，这是以前渔民们做梦也没想到，现在实现了。
    现在沈家门已没有一个失业的渔工了，渔工们都在欢笑着度过解放后的第一个春节。
