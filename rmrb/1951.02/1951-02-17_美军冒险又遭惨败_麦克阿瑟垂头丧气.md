Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: MacArthur, the defeated general who has suffered three disastrous defeats in a row under the powerful blows of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, is now forced to admit the disastrous defeat of the U.S. troops in their new risky gamble on the south bank of the Han River. Just as the heroic Chinese and Korean People's Army began to launch a powerful counter-offensive on the south bank of the Han River, causing the invading American troops who had ventured to advance to face a complete collapse, according to an Associated Press report: MacArthur hastily flew to Korea on the 13th. After he and Lieutenant General Ridgway, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, "inspected" the collapsing Han River front of the invading forces and returned to Tokyo, he hurriedly issued a statement saying that his troops, who were fleeing in a sorry state, were fighting a "war of maneuver," and that this was the "only kind of war his troops could fight."

This warmonger, who only a few days ago was still arrogantly predicting the "victory" of his military adventure, completely lost confidence only three days after the Chinese and Korean People's forces launched a powerful counter-offensive. He said: Those talks about "crossing the 38th parallel" are "purely academic." "The idea that we can cross Korea to establish a line and conduct positional warfare is completely unrealistic and illusory."

MacArthur here slapped his own face and the faces of his accomplices. People know how arrogant and dizzy the U.S. troops in Korea were before this new disastrous defeat. When MacArthur went to Korea on January 20 to arrange this new military adventure, he issued an arrogant statement saying: "No one can drive us into the sea. This commander intends to maintain a military position in Korea," "We will maintain it as long as we have to" (United Press). After this adventurous "offensive" was launched, "high-ranking U.S. officials" in Washington openly said on February 1st: "The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff has notified Lieutenant General Ridgway, commander of the United Nations Command in Korea, to recover Seoul and all the land south of the 38th parallel, and then establish a solid defensive position." This official also said: "The U.S. Congressional Security Committee made this decision in a secret meeting" with the aim of hoping that "the United States should at least control the territory occupied by the Republic of Korea" in order to "advance to the Manchurian border in the future" (United Press Washington, February 1st). The next day, "U.S. government officials" in Washington again emphasized: At present, when MacArthur seems to be able to fully control the military situation, the U.S. government does not want to take any action to restrain him" (Agence France-Presse, Washington, February 2nd). That is to say, the American invaders, who had advanced only a few kilometers in this adventurous "offensive," were once again dizzy with the fantasy of "crossing the 38th parallel" and "advancing to the Manchurian border."

On January 24th—on the eve of launching the new adventure, the U.S. troops in Korea, "the field division commanders and qualified officials of the Eighth Army Headquarters," happily believed that the U.S. military "had seized the initiative." On the 29th, the fifth day after launching the adventure, Ridgway, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, boasted: "Everything is going smoothly... A large part of our Eighth Army is conducting an offensive and showing its prowess" (United Press). On February 1st, the American magazine *Newsweek* said: After suffering three major defeats, "U.S. military leaders at the Pentagon (Note: the location of the U.S. Department of Defense), who are unwilling to express optimism easily, have been invigorated" (Agence France-Presse, New York, February 1st). On February 3rd, an Associated Press reporter said: The optimistic atmosphere among the American "senior officers" in Tokyo "is very obvious. They are full of confidence that not only can their foothold be held, but the offensive action can also severely damage the Communist army." On February 4th, "military and diplomatic figures" in Washington were even more ecstatic and cheered that "a new situation has occurred in Korea." They said: The Chinese and Korean People's Army "can no longer think of annihilating the United Nations forces or driving them into the sea" (Agence France-Presse).

However, in just a short time, under the initial counter-offensive of the Chinese and Korean People's Army, all the arrogant plans and elation of the American invaders immediately vanished. MacArthur's statement on the 13th fully demonstrated that under the powerful blows of the Chinese and Korean People, the confidence of the American invaders has been deteriorating day by day. MacArthur, who on January 20th declared his determination to "maintain a military position in Korea," now said somberly: The attempt to establish a line in Korea will "cause our troops to be destroyed piecemeal."

### 美军冒险又遭惨败  麦克阿瑟垂头丧气

　　美军冒险又遭惨败  麦克阿瑟垂头丧气
    【新华社十四日讯】在中朝人民部队的强大打击下连遭三次惨败的败将麦克阿瑟，现又不得不承认侵朝美军在汉江南岸新冒险的惨败。当英勇的中朝人民军队在汉江南岸正开始发起强大反攻、使冒险进犯的美国侵略军面临全线崩溃之际，据美联社消息：麦克阿瑟于十三日慌忙飞到朝鲜。他在和美第八军军长李奇微“巡视”了正在崩溃中的侵略军汉江前线而回到东京之后，急忙发表声明，说他的正在狼狈溃逃的部队是在打“运动战”，并说这是他的部队“所能打的惟一的一种战争”。
    这个在几天之前还在狂妄地预言他的军事冒险之“胜利”的战争贩子，仅仅在中朝人民部队发起强大反攻的第三天，就完全丧失了信心。他说：那些关于“越过三八线”的谈论是“纯粹是学院式的”。“认为我们可以横越朝鲜建立一条战线并进行阵地战的见解，是完全不切合现实的而且是虚妄的。”
    麦克阿瑟在这里打了他自己的和他的同伙们的嘴巴。人们知道：侵朝美军当局在此次再遭惨败之前，他们是何等的狂妄与冲昏头脑。麦克阿瑟在一月二十日到朝鲜布置这次新的军事冒险时，曾发表过一个狂妄的声明说：“没有人能把我们赶下海去，本司令打算在朝鲜保持一个军事阵地”，“要我们保持多久，我们便保持多久”（合众社）。在这次冒险“攻势”已经发动之后，华盛顿的美国“高级官员”在二月一日公然地说：“美国参谋长联席会议已通知朝鲜联合国司令李奇微中将，叫他收复汉城和三八线以南的一切土地，然后建立坚固的防御阵地。”这个官员并且说：“美国国会安全委员会秘密会议作出这个决定”，目的是希望“美国至少要控制大韩民国所占领的领土”，以便“将来向满洲边境进军”（合众社华盛顿一日电）。第二天，华盛顿的“美国政府人士”又强调指出：目前当麦克阿瑟似乎能够充分控制军事局势的时候，美国政府不希望采取任何行动，使他受到束缚”（法新社华盛顿二日电）。这就是说，在这次冒险“攻势”中稍许前进了没有几公里的美国侵略者，又冲昏头脑地幻想着要“越过三八线”、“向满洲边境进军”了。
    在一月二十四日——发动新冒险的前夕，侵朝美军“战地的师长们和第八军总部有资格的官员们”、高兴地认为：美军“已经掌握了主动权”。二十九日，发动了冒险后的第五天。美军第八军军长李奇微吹嘘说：“一切都在顺利地进行着，……我们第八军的挺大一部分军队正在进行攻势，大显身手”（合众社）。二月一日，美国《新闻周刊》说：在吃了三次大败仗之后“不肯轻易表示乐观的五角大楼（按：美国国防部所在地）的美国军事领袖们，精神已经振奋起来”（法新社纽约一日电）。二月三日，美联社记者又说：在东京的美国“高级军官之间的乐观空气是很显然的。他们充满信心，不但他们的立足点能够守得住，而且攻势行动也能够惨重地打击共军”。二月四日，华盛顿的“军界与外交人士”更得意忘形地欢呼说，“一种新的形势已在朝鲜发生了”。他们说：中朝人民军队“不能再想歼灭联合国部队或把他们赶下海了”（法新社）。
    但是，曾几何时，在中朝人民军队初步反攻之下，美国侵略者的一切狂妄计划与兴高采烈，就都立刻化为泡影。麦克阿瑟十三日的声明充分地表明：在中朝人民强大的打击下，美国侵略者的信心已经一天不如一天了。在一月二十日还声明决心要“在朝鲜保持一个军事阵地”的麦克阿瑟，现在却黯然地说：在朝鲜建立一条战线的企图，将“使我们的部队一部分一部分地遭到毁灭”。
