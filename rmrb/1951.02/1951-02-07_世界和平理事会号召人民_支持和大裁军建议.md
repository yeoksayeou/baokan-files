　　World Peace Council Calls on People to
    Support Great Disarmament Proposal
    (Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 3rd) TASS reported from Paris on the 3rd: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council issued a statement calling on people to support the Peace Congress's proposal on disarmament, stating: The United States' war expenditure in its 1951-52 budget is double that of the 1950-51 budget. However, the people of the world cannot agree to the arms race. The widespread movement of people in all countries demanding relief from the ever-increasing burden of armaments and demanding disarmament is a condition for striving for peace. The people of the whole world know that the arms race always leads to war. They know that only countries preparing for aggression will refuse to implement universal disarmament. They also know that universal disarmament is technically possible and can be achieved as long as these governments are willing to do so.
    In accordance with the resolutions passed by the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council calls on people to support the following proposals:
    1. An absolute ban on all atomic weapons and bacteriological, chemical, radioactive, and other tools of mass destruction;
    2. Declaring the government that first uses such weapons to be a war criminal;
    3. During the period from 1951 to 1952, reduce all armed forces—army, navy, and air force—by one-third to one-half in the same proportional and progressive manner;
    4. Establish an international control committee under the United Nations Security Council with qualified inspectors. This committee is responsible for controlling the reduction of conventional armaments and compliance with the ban on atomic, bacteriological, chemical, and other types of weapons. In order for control to be effective, this control must not only concern the armed forces declared by each country and the existing armaments and armaments production, but also include, at the request of the International Control Committee, inspections of suspected concealed troops and undeclared armaments and armaments production.
    The statement concluded by saying that these proposals on the reduction of armed forces are the first stage towards the ultimate goal of warriors for peace—universal and complete disarmament.

　　世界和平理事会号召人民
    支持和大裁军建议
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社巴黎三日讯：世界和平理事会秘书处发表声明，号召人民支持和平大会关于裁军的建议称：美国一九五一——五二年的预算中的战争费用，为一九五○——五一年预算的两倍。但是全世界人民不能同意军备竞赛。各国人民要求免受日益增大的军备负担及要求裁减军备的广大运动，是争取和平的条件。全世界的人民都知道军备竞赛总是导向战争。他们知道只有正在准备侵略的国家才会拒绝实行普遍裁军。他们同时也知道：普遍裁军在技术上是可能的，并且只要这些政府愿意做就能够实现。
    世界和平理事会秘书处遵照第二届世界和平大会在华沙所通过的决议，号召人民支持下列建议：
    一、绝对禁止各种原子武器和细菌、化学、放射性及其他有大规模毁灭力的工具；
    二、宣布第一个使用这种武器的政府为战争罪犯；
    三、在一九五一年至一九五二年的期间，按同样比例累进地裁减一切军队——陆军、海军、空军的三分之一到二分之一；
    四、在联合国安全理事会下建立拥有合格视察员的国际管制委员会。该委员会负责管制常规军备的裁减及对原子、细菌、化学与其他类型武器的禁令的遵守。为了使管制有效，这种管制必须不仅关涉到每个国家所宣布的武装部队及现有的军备与军备的生产情形，并且在国际管制委员会的要求之下还应包括检查众信可能暗藏的军队和未经宣布的军备和军备生产。
    声明最后称：这些关于裁减武装部队的建议，是走向和平战士的最终目标——普遍彻底的裁军的第一阶段。
