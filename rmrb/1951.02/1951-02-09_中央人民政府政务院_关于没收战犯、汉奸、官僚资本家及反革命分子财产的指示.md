　　Instruction of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Confiscating the Property of War Criminals, Traitors, Bureaucrat-Capitalists, and Counter-Revolutionary Elements

    Regarding the issue of clearing public shares and public property in enterprises, the Financial and Economic Committee of this Council has formulated the "Measures for Clearing Public Shares and Public Property in Enterprises," which has been approved and promulgated for implementation by the 66th Government Affairs Conference of this Council. The following instructions are hereby issued regarding the procedure for legally confiscating the shares and property of war criminals, traitors, bureaucrat-capitalists, and other counter-revolutionary elements in enterprises as stipulated in Article 3 (3) of the said measures:

    1.  When the shares and property of war criminals, traitors, and bureaucrat-capitalists in joint public-private enterprises and private enterprises should be legally confiscated, it must be reported to the People's Government (Military and Political Committee) of the Greater Administrative Area for review and then forwarded to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval before execution. Before approval is obtained, only registration, freezing, or sealing up may be carried out in order to prevent destruction, transfer, or concealment; confiscation shall not be announced.

    2.  The shares and property of general bandits, special agents, local tyrants, and counter-revolutionary elements other than those mentioned in the preceding article in enterprises shall be executed upon approval by the Provincial People's Government (or the Special Commissioner's Office specifically designated by the Provincial People's Government) when the confiscation is judged by the County (City) People's Court or People's Court; those judged by the Provincial (City) People's Court or People's Tribunal may be executed without reporting for approval.

    3.  Property mentioned in the preceding two articles that has been confiscated in the past by judgments of County (City) People's Courts, People's Courts at all levels, or decisions of People's Governments at all levels, and has already been executed without objection, shall not be changed.

    4.  If there is property in the enterprise as mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 of this instruction that has not yet been confiscated by the government, the business executor of the enterprise shall report to the local People's Government in accordance with the provisions of Article 22 of the "Measures for Clearing Public Shares and Public Property in Enterprises," otherwise they shall be punished according to law.

                        Premier Zhou Enlai, February 4, 1951
