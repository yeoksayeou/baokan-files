Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has issued the following decision regarding International Women's Day on March 8th:

　　The working people of the Soviet Union are commemorating International Women's Day on March 8th this year amidst the atmosphere of successive victories in communist construction and a great upsurge in mass political and labor activity.

　　In the process of electing local Soviets of Workers' Deputies and Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, the Soviet people have once again demonstrated their spiritual and political unity, as well as their unanimous support for the policies implemented by the Party of Lenin and Stalin and their tireless determination to strengthen the power of the socialist motherland.

　　Thanks to the selfless efforts of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals in the post-war Five-Year Plan, the economy in all parts of our country that suffered from the ravages of war has been restored, and the pre-war level of development of the Soviet national economy has been greatly surpassed. Industry, transportation, and agriculture have acquired a large number of new and modern equipment, and labor productivity has been greatly improved. Based on the progress of the national economy, the national income of the Soviet Union is steadily rising, the welfare of the working people is improving day by day, the prices of consumer goods have been systematically reduced, the purchasing power of the people is increasing, and the culture of Soviet socialism is developing smoothly.

　　Our country's success in economic and cultural construction, and the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace—a policy of struggle for peace and international cooperation—have further strengthened the Soviet Union's international prestige.

　　Soviet women have played a significant role in achieving the achievements of communist construction. Women actively participate in all sectors of the domestic economy and cultural life. The Bolshevik Party gives Soviet women great possibilities to develop their creativity, raising Soviet women to a height unattainable by women in capitalist countries. Like all the people of the Soviet Union, Soviet women are the true masters of their country and active builders of communism. Millions of glorious patriotic women are faithfully engaged in industrial, transportation, and construction work, improving their knowledge and production skills, and mastering technology and advanced labor methods. There are more than 380,000 women serving as engineers and technicians, an increase of more than 50,000 in the past year alone.

　　Women in collective farms are actively striving to promote the progress of agriculture, and they are at the forefront of socialist competition for bumper harvests every year, for the comprehensive increase in the breeding of publicly owned livestock and the output of livestock products. Tens of thousands of women hold administrative positions in collective farms and are agricultural experts.

　　Soviet women have become a huge cultural force. The role of women in the development of Soviet science, technology, and art is constantly increasing. There are approximately 60,000 women scientists working in universities, colleges, and scientific research institutes in the Soviet Union. Their creative efforts have enriched Soviet science, making it even more glorious. Many women are extremely active in the fields of art and literature and are creating works of art that are imbued with noble ideas and inspire the Soviet people to create new great achievements for the motherland. Three hundred and ninety-nine women have received the Stalin Prize for outstanding achievements in the fields of science, invention, art, and literature.

　　Soviet women play a vital role in public education and health. Nine hundred and forty-five thousand female teachers are educating school children in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and communist consciousness. More than one million women work in public health, of which 191,000 are physicians.

　　The Communist Party and the Soviet government have greatly commended the achievements of Soviet women in defending the socialist motherland and in peaceful construction. The title of Hero of the Soviet Union has been awarded to seventy women, and the title of Hero of Socialist Labor has been awarded to one thousand nine hundred and eighty-eight women; more than 600,000 women have received various medals and orders of the Soviet Union.

　　In our country, mothers who nurture the younger generation—the future of our motherland—receive constant care. The honorary title of "Mother Heroine" has been awarded to more than 33,000 women, and the "Mother's Glory" Order and the "Medal of Motherhood" have been awarded to more than three million women. In 1950 alone, the state allocated more than 3.5 billion rubles in subsidies to mothers with large families and unmarried mothers. The number of maternity hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, and Young Pioneer camps is increasing every year. Every year, more than five million children recuperate in Young Pioneer camps, sanatoriums, and other children's institutions.

　　Soviet women actively participate in political life. Two hundred and eighty of the finest daughters of the Soviet people are representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Hundreds of women have been elected to the Supreme Soviets of the Union and Autonomous Republics, and more than 500,000 women have been elected to local Soviets.

　　The experience of the Soviet Union has convinced all mankind that only the victory of socialism can guarantee the complete emancipation of women and ensure their active participation in social life.

　　Women in the People's Democratic countries are also following the example of Soviet women and actively participating in the construction of a new life. Women in China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic, together with all the working people, have achieved new victories in consolidating the people's democratic system, developing their countries' economies, and improving the living standards of the working people. The creative activities of women in the German Democratic Republic are flourishing.

　　While women in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are commemorating March 8th with new victories in peaceful construction, women in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies are commemorating this day amidst the further offensive of capitalist forces against the living standards and democratic rights of the working people. Ever-increasing military expenditures, rising consumer prices, rising taxes and rents, and increasing unemployment—all of these are worsening the living conditions of the working people. Desperate scarcity, poverty, and hunger—this is the fate of millions of people in capitalist and colonial countries. These disasters and poverty have a particularly severe impact on women and children.

　　The working women of the world are celebrating International Women's Day amidst the tense struggle to halt the threat of a new world war. The American and British imperialists who launched the bloody aggression in Korea are preparing for a new world war. The activities of the masses of the people to rise up and defend peace and their economic and democratic rights are developing day by day. The scale and strength of the front of organized peace fighters, headed by the great Soviet Socialist Republic Union, is growing daily. The signatures of 500 million people on the Stockholm Appeal demanding a ban on atomic weapons, and the resolutions issued by the Second World Peace Congress, have demonstrated the common desire of the people of all countries to defend the great cause of peace and to smash the sinister conspiracies of the instigators of new wars.

　　The international women's movement is a growing force in the struggle for peace and democracy, with more than 90 million women united in the Women's International Democratic Federation.

　　The women of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are the vanguard of the international women's democratic movement for peace.

　　The task of Soviet women is to continue to strengthen international ties with women in the People's Democratic countries and capitalist countries, and to intensify the struggle with them for world peace, for international friendship, and against the instigators of new imperialist wars.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) recommends that all organizations of the Party celebrate International Women's Day on March 8th under the banner of mobilizing all the forces of working women to strive for a new upsurge in the economy and culture of the motherland, and to further strengthen the power of the Soviet socialist state—the fortress of world peace.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls on female workers, female engineers, and female technicians to redouble their efforts, make full use of all possibilities to complete and exceed production plans, fully master technology, improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce production costs, and implement the strictest economy in production and construction.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls on collective farm women and all women engaged in agricultural labor to work hard to further strengthen collective farms organizationally and economically, achieve bumper harvests every year, maximize the number of publicly owned livestock and the output of livestock products, complete the Stalin plan to transform nature, and produce sufficient food and raw materials to supply our industry.

　　Women workers in science and culture must use their creativity to further develop socialist culture, science, art, public education, public health, and on a large scale application of the most advanced Soviet scientific achievements.

　　Soviet women, together with the Soviet people, must promote the victorious realization of the construction plans of the great communist projects—the hydroelectric power stations on the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, the canals and irrigation systems in the Volga region and the Caspian region, and Ukraine and Crimea by all means.

　　The task of building communism requires Party organizations to continue to absorb women into the work of industry, transportation, and agriculture, to strengthen political work among women, to systematically improve their cultural and technical levels, and to strengthen their political and production activism. Promoting women to leadership positions is very important for building a communist society. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) requires Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations to more boldly and resolutely promote advanced women, so that they can assume leadership positions in Party work, Soviet work, economic work, trade union work, and Communist Youth League work.

　　Party organizations, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, Soviet, and economic organs must pay more attention to improving the labor conditions and living conditions of female workers, collective farm women, female office workers, and all working women; it is necessary to continuously help mothers raise children, expand the distribution network of nurseries, medical clinics, public canteens, clothing stores, laundries, and other public service institutions necessary to reduce women's housework, and improve their work.

　　On the occasion of International Women's Day—March 8th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) pays tribute to all Soviet women—female workers, collective farm women, female engineers, female technicians, female agricultural experts, female animal breeders, female teachers, female medical workers, female scientists and literary workers, and female employees of various Soviet organs, and deeply believes that Soviet women will continue to be at the forefront of the warriors who are fighting for the prosperity of the Soviet economy and culture, and for the construction of a communist society in our country, and move forward.

　　联共中央颁布纪念“三八”国际妇女节的决定
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党（布）中央委员会颁布关于三月八日国际妇女节的决定如下：
    苏联劳动人民今年在共产主义的建设节节胜利、群众的政治和劳动活动巨大高涨的气氛中纪念三月八日国际妇女节。
    苏联人民在选举地方劳动人民代表苏维埃和各加盟共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃的过程中，再次表现了他们在精神上和政治上的团结，也表明了对列宁和斯大林党所实行的政策的一致拥护和他们不倦地加强社会主义祖国的力量的决心。
    由于工人、集体农民和知识分子在战后五年计划中的忘我的努力，我国各地遭受战争蹂躏的经济已告恢复，苏联国民经济的战前发展水平已经被大大超过。工业、运输和农业已获得大量的新的现代化的装备，劳动生产率已大大提高。基于国民经济上的进展，苏联的国民收入正稳步地上升着，劳动人民的福利日益改善，消费品的价格已经有计划地降低，人民的购买力正在提高，苏维埃社会主义的文化在顺利地发展着。
    我国在经济和文化建设上的成功，苏联一贯的和平政策——为和平和国际合作而斗争的政策，已进一步加强了苏联在国际上的威信。
    苏联妇女在获得共产主义建设的成就上发挥了很大的作用。妇女们积极参加了国内经济与文化生活的各个部门。布尔什维克党给苏联妇女以发展她们的创造力的极大的可能性，把苏联妇女提高到资本主义国家妇女所望尘莫及的高度。象苏联一切人民一样，苏联妇女是她们国家的真正主人和共产主义的积极建设者。千百万光荣的爱国的妇女们，都在忠实地从事工业、运输与建筑工作，她们正在提高她们的知识与生产技术，掌握技术与先进的劳动方法。妇女充任工程师与技师的已有三十八万余人，仅在去年一年内就增加了五万余人。
    集体农场的妇女正为促进农业的进步而积极奋斗，她们并为年年丰收、为公有牲畜繁殖及牲畜产品出产率的全面增加而担任社会主义竞赛的前锋。数以万计的妇女在集体农场里担任行政工作，并且是农业专家。
    苏联妇女已经成为一支巨大的文化力量。妇女在苏维埃科学、技术及艺术的发展中所起的作用正在不断增加。苏联大约有六万名妇女科学工作者在各大学、各学院及科学研究所中工作。她们的创造性的努力丰富了苏联的科学，使它越发光荣。许多妇女在艺术与文学的领域中极为活跃，并正在创造艺术作品，这些作品中贯注着高尚的思想，鼓舞苏联人民为祖国创造新的伟业。已经有三百九十九名妇女因为在科学、发明、艺术、文学的领域中的杰出成就而得到斯大林奖金。
    苏联妇女在公共教育与卫生事业方面起了极为重要的作用。九十四万五千名女教师正在以苏维埃爱国主义共产主义自觉性的精神教育着学校儿童。一百余万妇女在公共卫生事业中工作，其中十九万一千人是医师。
    共产党与苏维埃政府大大地表扬了苏联妇女在保卫社会主义祖国与和平的建设性劳动方面的功勋。苏联英雄的称号已经授予七十名妇女，社会主义劳动英雄的称号已经授予一千九百八十八名妇女；六十余万妇女得到了苏联的各种奖章与勋章。
    在我国，抚育年青的一代——我们祖国的未来——的母亲是得到经常的关怀的。“母亲英雄”的光荣称号已经授予三万三千多名妇女，“母亲之光”勋章和“母德奖章”已经授予三百余万名妇女。单是一九五○年一年之中，国家已经拨款三十五亿卢布以上津贴家庭人口众多的母亲和未婚的母亲们。产科医院、托儿所、幼稚园、少年先锋营的数目每年都在增加。每年有五百余万儿童在少年先锋营、疗养院以及其他儿童机关中休养。
    苏联妇女积极参加政治生活。二百八十个苏联人民的最优秀的女儿是苏联最高苏维埃的代表。几百个妇女已被选入各加盟共和国及自治共和国最高苏维埃，五十万以上的妇女已被选入地方苏维埃。
    苏联的经验使全人类都相信：只有社会主义的胜利才能保证妇女的完全解放，才能保证她们的积极参与社会生活。
    人民民主国家的妇女们也仿效苏联妇女的榜样，积极地参加新生活的建设。中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚及蒙古人民共和国的妇女与所有的劳动人民一起，已在巩固人民民主制度，发展她们国家的经济上以及在提高劳动人民的生活水平上获得了新的胜利。德意志民主共和国妇女的创造性活动正在蓬勃发展之中。
    当苏联及人民民主国家的妇女们用和平建设方面的新胜利来纪念三八节的时候，资本主义国家、殖民地及附属国的妇女们却在资本主义势力对劳动人民的生活水平及民主权利之进一步进攻的情况下纪念这一天。军费日益膨胀，消费品价格不断上涨，赋税及房租逐渐上升，失业人数日益增加——这一切都使劳动人民的生活条件更趋恶化。绝望的匮乏、贫穷、饥饿——这就是资本主义及殖民地国家中千百万人民的命运。这些灾难与贫穷对于妇女及儿童的影响特别严重。
    全世界的劳动妇女们正在制止新世界战争威胁的紧张斗争的环境中庆祝国际妇女节。在朝鲜发动血腥侵略的美英帝国主义者正在准备新的世界战争。人民群众奋起保卫和平与他们的经济及民主权利的活动正在一天一天地发展。以伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为首的有组织的和平战士的战线，其规模和力量正在日益扩大。五亿人在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上的签名，和第二届世界和平大会发表的决议，已表现了各国人民保卫伟大和平事业及粉碎新战争煽动者的罪恶阴谋的共同愿望。
    国际妇女运动在争取和平及民主的斗争中是日益增长的一支力量，已有九千多万妇女团结在国际民主妇女联合会之中。
    苏联及各人民民主国家的妇女是争取和平的国际妇女民主运动的先锋队。
    苏联妇女的任务是继续加强与各人民民主国家及资本主义国家妇女们的国际联系，并与她们一道加紧进行争取世界和平、争取国际友谊、及反对帝国主义新战争挑拨者的斗争。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会建议党的一切组织在动员劳动妇女的一切力量为争取祖国的经济和文化新高涨、为进一步加强苏维埃社会主义国家——世界和平的堡垒——的力量而斗争的旗帜下，庆祝三月八日国际妇女节。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会号召女工、女工程师、女技师们加倍努力工作，充分利用一切可能性来完成并且超过生产计划，充分掌握技术，提高劳动生产率，提高产品的质量，减低生产成本，在生产和建设中实行最严格的节约。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会号召集体农妇和一切从事农业劳动的妇女努力在组织上和经济上进一步加强集体农场，做到年年丰收；尽量增加公有牲畜头数与牲畜产品的出产率；完成改造自然的斯大林计划；生产充足的食物与供给我国工业的原料。
    科学与文化方面的妇女工作者必须把她们的创造能力用在进一步发展社会主义的文化、科学、艺术、公共教育、公共卫生上面，用在大规模应用最先进的苏维埃科学成就方面。
    苏联妇女必须与苏联人民一道用一切办法促进共产主义伟大工程——伏尔加河和第聂伯河上的水力发电站，伏尔加地区与里海地区、乌克兰与克里米亚的运河与灌溉系统——的建设计划的胜利实现。
    建设共产主义的任务需要党组织继续吸收妇女到工业、运输、农业的工作中来，加强对妇女的政治工作，有计划地提高她们的文化与技术水平，加强她们的政治与生产积极性。提拔妇女们担任领导职务对于建设共产主义社会是非常重要的。苏联共产党（布）中央委员会要求党、苏维埃、工会和共产主义青年团组织更大胆、更坚决地提拔先进妇女，使她们在党的工作、苏维埃工作、经济工作、工会工作和共产主义青年团的工作中担任领导职务。
    党的组织、工会、共产主义青年团、苏维埃和经济机关必须更加关心改善女工、集体农妇、机关女职员和所有劳动妇女的劳动条件与生活条件；必需不断地帮助母亲们抚养小孩，扩大托儿所、医疗所、公共食堂、成衣店、洗衣店、以及减轻妇女家务工作所必需的其他公众服务机构的分布网，并改进它们的工作。
    值此国际妇女节——三月八日，苏联共产党（布）中央委员会向全体苏联妇女——女工、集体农妇、女工程师、女技术人员、女农业专家、女动物饲养者、女教师、女医药工作者、女科学文艺工作者和苏联各机关的女职员们致敬，并且深信苏联妇女在将来会继续走在为了苏联经济与文化的昌盛，为了在我国建设共产主义社会而奋斗的战士们的最前列，向前迈进。
