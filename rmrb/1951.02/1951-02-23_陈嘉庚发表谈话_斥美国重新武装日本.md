Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 21st: Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association, recently issued a statement regarding the US imperialist plot to re-arm Japan. He pointed out that the US imperialists' re-armament of Japan is to realize their sinister conspiracy to invade Asia and dominate the world. He painfully recalled the tragic scenes of millions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang being madly burned and slaughtered by Japanese bandits during the Pacific War. He said: "The suffering of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang under the atrocities of Japanese bandits was as severe as that suffered by the people in China. When Singapore fell, the Japanese bandits drove all the residents onto the streets, leaving them without food or shelter for four or five days. At that time, four to five thousand overseas Chinese in Singapore were captured and killed by the Japanese bandits. One overseas Chinese youth was even hung from a tree by the Japanese bandits, first cut horizontally and stabbed vertically with knives, then sprayed with boiling water, and finally burned to death. It was extremely cruel.” He also said: “Since the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, attempting to dominate the world, the restrictions imposed on overseas Chinese in Nanyang have become increasingly severe, such as the closure of the Nanqiao Daily and restrictions on overseas remittances.” He believes that the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association's suggestion to hold protest demonstrations in major cities across the country on February 21st, the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System," to protest against the US arming of Japan, to launch returned overseas Chinese to sign patriotic covenants, to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and to offer condolences to overseas Chinese is very good. Returned overseas Chinese in various places should do it earnestly. He continued: Overseas Chinese in Nanyang made many contributions to the motherland during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and now they should more actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and strive to completely smash the US imperialist plot of aggressive war.

　　陈嘉庚发表谈话  斥美国重新武装日本
    【新华社福州二十一日电】南洋华侨救赈总会主席陈嘉庚最近就美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋罪行发表谈话。他指出：美帝国主义重新武装日本，是为要实现其侵略亚洲、霸占全世界的罪恶阴谋。他沉痛地追述了太平洋战争中南洋各地数百万华侨遭受日寇疯狂烧杀的惨景。他说：“南洋华侨遭受日寇暴行，如国内人民所遭受的一样严重。新加坡陷落时，日寇把所有的居民都赶到路上，一连四五天不得食宿。当时在新加坡的华侨，就遭日寇捕杀了四五千人。有一个华侨青年在那次并曾被日寇吊在树上，先用刀横割直戳，再用沸水喷浇，然后用火烧死，残酷至极。”他又说：“自美帝国主义发动侵朝战争妄想霸占全世界以来，南洋各地华侨所受的限制，也日益严重起来，如南侨日报被封闭，和侨汇均受限制等。”他认为：北京归国华侨联谊会建议于二月二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”在全国各大城市举行归国华侨抗议美国武装日本示威游行、发动归国华侨订立爱国公约、慰劳我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军、以及慰问海外的华侨等工作，是很好的。各地归侨要实实在在去作。他接着说：南洋各地华侨在抗日战争中对祖国曾有很多贡献，现在应该更积极参加抗美援朝运动，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义侵略战争的阴谋而奋斗。
