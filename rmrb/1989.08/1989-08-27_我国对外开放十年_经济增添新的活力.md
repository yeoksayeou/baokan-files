Over the past decade of implementing an open-door policy, China's coastal regions have formed a multi-tiered open framework that includes five special economic zones, 12 economic and technological development zones, 14 coastal open cities, and 283 open counties. The economic strength of China's coastal open regions has significantly increased, making them important bases for developing foreign trade exports, attracting foreign investment, and promoting economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with other countries.

The open-door policy has injected new vitality into China's national economy. Over the past ten years, China's total import and export trade volume has increased fourfold. More than $300 billion in foreign loans have been utilized for key construction projects in transportation, energy, agriculture, education, and other sectors, making up for the shortage of domestic construction funds. Over 20,000 advanced technologies and pieces of equipment have been introduced, transforming a number of key enterprises and promoting technological progress. More than 7,000 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises have been established, serving as a beneficial supplement to the socialist economy.

Ten years ago, Shenzhen and most of the coastal open cities' economic and technological development zones were just small fishing villages, tidal flats, and farmlands by the sea. Now, high-rise buildings and modern factory complexes have risen, changing the map of the eastern part of the country. The development zones, which started in late 1984, have now built 1.6 million square meters of factory facilities, with over 570 industrial projects in production or trial production. It is estimated that this year's total industrial output value of the development zones will reach 2.5 billion yuan, achieving a tax revenue of 440 million yuan and an export value of $250 million.

In the past decade of practicing the open-door policy, China has formed a pattern focusing on special economic zones, coastal open cities, and coastal economic open areas, gradually advancing from the coast to the inland regions. The 283 coastal open counties have adapted to the needs of opening up, actively adjusting their industrial structures, and have seen significant development in rural economies and export-oriented economies. Statistics show that in recent years, the growth rate of the total social product of these open counties has been 6 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate during the same period.

A responsible official from the State Council's Special Zone Office recently pointed out that practice has proven that the open-door policy has injected vitality into the national economy, has been supported by the people, and is a good policy for strengthening the country and enriching the people. We will definitely not return to the old path of "closure." Instead, we will do a better job of opening up. He proposed that the current coastal open regions should fully leverage their own advantages and focus on the following aspects: first, strive to expand foreign trade; second, while continuing to introduce key advanced technologies, focus on the digestion, absorption, and localization of introduced technologies; third, further improve the investment environment, especially the soft environment, and continue to actively attract foreign investment; fourth, extensively and deeply develop economic and technological cooperation with inland regions, driving the revitalization of the economies in central and western regions.

    我国对外开放十年  经济增添新的活力
    据新华社北京8月27日电  （记者朱幼棣）实施对外开放十年来，我国沿海已形成包括5个经济特区、12个经济技术开发区、14个沿海开放城市和283个开放县的多层次的开放格局。我国沿海开放地区的经济实力明显增强，成为发展外贸出口、吸收外国投资、发展对外经济技术交流与合作的重要基地。
    对外开放给我国的国民经济增添了新的活力。十年来，我国进出口贸易总额增长4倍。使用了300多亿美元的国外贷款，用于交通、能源、农业、教育等重点建设项目，弥补了国内建设资金的不足；引进了两万多项先进技术和设备，改造了一批骨干企业，推动了科技进步；已经办起的7000多家中外合资、合作经营企业和外商独资企业，成为社会主义经济的有益补充。
    十年前的深圳和大多数沿海开放城市的经济技术开发区所在地，还只是小渔村、滩涂和海边的庄稼地，现在，一幢幢高楼和成片现代化厂房，已经拔地而起，使共和国东部的地图为之改观。1984年底起步的各开发区目前已建成160万平方米的厂房等设施，有570多个工业项目投产或试生产。预计今年开发区的全部工业产值可达25亿元，实现利税4.4亿元，出口值达2.5亿美元。
    在过去十年对外开放的实践中，我国形成了经济特区——沿海开放城市——沿海经济开放区为重点，由沿海向内地逐步推进的格局。283个沿海开放县适应开放需要，积极调整产业结构，农村经济和外向型经济也有了较大发展。据统计，近几年这些开放县农村社会总产值的增长速度比全国同期平均增长速度快6个百分点。
    国务院特区办公室负责人最近指出，实践证明，对外开放使国民经济增添了活力，受到了人民的拥护，是强国富民的好政策，我们决不会复回到“关闭”的老路上去。而是要把开放工作搞得更好。他提出当前沿海开放地区要充分发挥自身优势，做好这几方面的工作：一是努力拓展对外贸易；二是在继续引进关键先进技术的同时，大力做好引进技术的消化吸收和国产化工作；三是进一步改善投资环境特别是软环境，继续积极吸收外商投资；四是广泛深入发展同内地的经济技术联合，带动中、西部地区经济振兴。
