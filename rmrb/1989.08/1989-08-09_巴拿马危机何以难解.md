On August 4, the second round of talks between the Panamanian government, military, and opposition forces broke down due to differing opinions, failing to reach an agreement. The main point of contention was that the opposition demanded a public referendum on August 20 to decide on the formation of an interim government, the resignation of Noriega, and the recognition of the May 7 election results. The government, however, argued that holding a public referendum or election was impossible under the current circumstances, with U.S. troops in Panama being hostile. Thus, efforts by various Panamanian factions to resolve the crisis, which arose from the government's declaration of the May 7 election as invalid, once again hit a snag.

Since the Panamanian authorities declared the May election invalid, the Organization of American States (OAS) has been engaged in political mediation. A delegation consisting of the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago, along with the OAS Secretary-General, has repeatedly visited Panama to meet with government and opposition figures, seeking ways to resolve the crisis. On July 15 and 16, under the delegation's auspices, the Panamanian government, opposition parties, and military held talks to discuss power transfer, the May 7 election, Noriega's resignation, and the cessation of U.S. aggression and military threats against Panama. However, no positive results were achieved. On July 20, the OAS issued a statement calling for new elections in Panama as soon as possible and urging the current government to transfer power as scheduled on September 1. This statement was welcomed by government officials, but the opposition insisted on recognizing the May 7 election results and rejected the statement.

It is reported that in the new round of dialogue that began on August 3, the government representatives proposed a five-point plan, including the formation of a "broadly participatory interim government" on September 1 to organize free elections in the shortest possible time. They also proposed lifting U.S. sanctions against Panama as a "necessary condition" for re-election. The opposition deemed the government's proposal "undemocratic," demanding a public referendum to make decisions and insisting on setting a date for Noriega to relinquish his military leadership during the dialogue. Thus, the situation once again reached a stalemate.

Looking back at the developments in Panama over the past three months, the political crisis, which deepened after the official declaration of the election as invalid, is difficult to resolve because the Panamanian people's struggle for democracy and the internal conflict between dictatorship are intertwined with Panama's national struggle against U.S. interference, making it complex. The Panamanian people's efforts to achieve democratization and maintain national sovereignty have been arduous.

The United States initially hoped to oust Noriega through the May elections in Panama and have its supported opposition take power to implement policies favorable to it. The declaration of the election as invalid dashed U.S. hopes. In this context, the Bush administration, in a fit of anger, ordered the deployment of 2,000 additional soldiers to Panama, conducted multiple military exercises, and threatened Panama with military force. Bush also publicly incited the Panamanian people and military to overthrow Noriega, continuing to exert high pressure on Panama in political, economic, and diplomatic spheres. The Bush administration's actions aim to maintain its political, economic, and military strategic interests in Panama. According to the new canal treaty signed by the two countries in September 1977, by December 31, 1999, Panama would fully regain sovereignty over the canal zone, and U.S. troops would completely withdraw from Panama. However, the United States has always hoped to retain a military base in the Panama Canal Zone after 2000, which is unacceptable to National Guard Commander Noriega and the Panamanian people. This is the crux of the U.S.'s insistence on interfering in Panamanian internal affairs and the resulting tension in U.S.-Panamanian relations.

Currently, due to the worsening relations between the U.S. and Panama, the management of the Panama Canal has been affected. The 1977 Panama Canal Treaty stipulates that starting from January 1 next year, the co-management of the canal will shift from being primarily U.S.-led to being primarily Panamanian-led, and the head of the canal management commission will be replaced by a Panamanian. By the end of June, Panama had already appointed Thomas Altamirano as the new head of the canal management commission, pending approval by the U.S. Senate. Due to the U.S. defaulting on Panama's canal rent, refusing to adjust canal transit fees, and causing a deficit of $12 million in the first nine months of the 1989 fiscal year, Washington has repeatedly refused to issue visas to Panamanian participants in the commission's meetings, affecting the commission's work. Panama believes that the involvement of political issues "threatens the normal operation of the canal."

Latin American countries are closely watching the situation in Panama. They blame Noriega for the crisis, calling on him to transfer power to "democratic institutions," and hope that Panama can peacefully resolve the political crisis. However, these countries unanimously oppose foreign interference in Panamanian internal affairs, advocating that the Panama issue can only be resolved by the Panamanian people themselves.

    巴拿马危机何以难解
    管彦忠
    8月4日，巴拿马政府、军方和反对派的第二轮会谈因与会者各持己见，未能达成协议而中断。这次分歧主要是：反对派要求8月20日举行公民投票，就成立临时政府、诺列加辞职和承认5月7日选举结果等问题进行表决；而政府认为在目前美国驻巴拿马的军队充满敌意的情况下，无法举行公民投票或选举。至此，巴拿马各方为解决因官方宣布5月7日大选无效而出现的危机所作的努力再次受挫。
    自巴拿马当局宣布5月大选无效之后，美洲国家组织一直在进行政治斡旋活动。由厄瓜多尔、危地马拉和特里尼达和多巴哥3国外长及该组织秘书长组成的代表团，多次访问巴拿马，与政府和反对党人士会晤，寻求解决巴拿马危机的方式。7月15日和16日，在该代表团的主持下，巴拿马政府、反对党及军方举行对话，讨论了权力移交、5月7日大选、诺列加辞职及停止美国对巴的侵略和军事威胁等问题，但没有取得积极成果。7月20日，美洲国家组织通过声明，要求巴拿马近期尽快举行新的大选，敦促巴现政府今年9月1日任期满后如期移交政权。这项声明受到了巴拿马政府人士的欢迎，可是反对派坚持要求承认5月7日大选结果，拒绝了这一声明。
    据悉，在8月3日开始的新一轮对话中，政府代表提出了一项五点计划，内容包括9月1日组成一个“广泛参与的临时政府”，负责在尽可能短的时间内组织自由选举，同时提出取消美国对巴制裁作为重新选举的“必要条件”。反对派认为政府的上述主张是“反民主的”，要求通过公民投票来作出决定并坚持在对话中确定诺列加放弃军事领导权的日期。这样，事情又陷于僵局。
    纵观3个月来巴局势的发展，这场因官方宣布大选无效而加深的政治危机之所以难解，是因为巴拿马人民争取民主的要求与独裁统治的国内矛盾同巴拿马反对美国干涉内政的民族矛盾交织在一起，错综复杂，使巴拿马人民实现民主化和维护国家主权的斗争步履维艰。
    美国原想通过巴拿马5月大选把诺列加赶下台，由它支持的反对派上台而执行对它有利的政策。巴拿马宣布大选无效，使美国的希望成为泡影。在此情况下，布什政府恼羞成怒，下令向巴增派2000名士兵，多次举行军事演习，对巴实行武力威吓。布什还公开鼓动巴拿马人民和军队推翻诺列加，在政治、经济、外交等领域对巴继续施加高压。布什政府这样做的目的，是为维护它在巴拿马的政治、经济和军事战略利益。本来，按照1977年9月两国签署的新运河条约，到1999年12月31日，巴拿马将全部收回运河区主权，美国军队全部撤离巴拿马。但是，美国一直希望在2000年以后仍然保留在巴拿马运河区的军事基地，这是国防军司令诺列加和巴拿马人民绝不能接受的。这就是美国坚持干涉巴拿马内政和由此而来的美巴关系紧张的症结所在。
    眼下，由于美巴两国关系的日益紧张已对巴拿马运河的管理造成了影响。1977年的巴拿马运河新条约规定，从明年1月1日起，运河的共管权将从现在以美国为主转为以巴拿马为主，运河管理委员会主任将由巴拿马人取代美国人。6月底巴拿马已任命托马斯·阿尔塔米拉诺为新的运河管理委员会主任，按程序有待美国参议院认可。由于美国拖欠巴拿马的运河租金，拒绝调整运河通行费，已使1989财政年度管理费头9个月的赤字达到1200万美元。华盛顿还多次拒绝发给参加管理委员会会议的巴方人士签证，影响委员会的工作。巴拿马认为，政治问题的介入“对运河的正常运营构成威胁”。
    拉美国家对巴拿马局势十分关注。它们指责诺列加宣布大选无效对危机负有责任，呼吁诺列加将权力移交给“民主机构”，希望巴拿马各方和平解决政治危机，但这些国家一致反对外国干涉巴拿马内政，主张巴拿马问题只能由巴拿马人民自己去解决。
