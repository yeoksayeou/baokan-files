A team of desert researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has announced that after completing their investigation of the Taklamakan Desert, they discovered at least 82 species of wild animals living and breeding in this, China's largest desert. This new discovery is of great significance in re-evaluating the ecological environment of the Taklamakan Desert.

At the beginning of this century, the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin led an expedition into the Taklamakan Desert. During their investigation, they only saw one mosquito, and because no other living creatures were found, he concluded that even the mosquito had been brought into the desert on humans or livestock.

Last autumn, the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized a comprehensive investigation team that entered the heart of the desert along the Keriya River. During their investigation, they discovered wild camels, red foxes, Tarim hares, various large-eared hedgehogs, sand rats, jumping mice, white-tailed magpies, white-winged woodpeckers, sand foxes, West Asian tigers, green toads, and Yarkand loaches, among other animals, totaling over 80 species. These animals belong to mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, with 90% of them being discovered for the first time. They either hide during the day and come out at night, or they forage and play during the day, their activities being both frequent and mysterious.

The towering wild camels are the "king of beasts" in the desert. In winter, they often roam the desert in groups of seventy or eighty, and at the slightest disturbance, they disappear into the sand sea like the wind. The cunning fox often sneaks into the camps of oil workers at night to search for leftover food.

Vice Researcher Gu Jinghe of the desert investigation team told reporters that although the desert interior is extremely arid, the food chain is complete: plants absorb water from underground through their unusually long root systems; animals obtain water by eating plants; many large animals eat small animals to survive, forming the characteristics of the desert ecosystem.

### 塔克拉玛干并非“死亡之海”  大沙漠腹地也有“动物世界”

    塔克拉玛干并非“死亡之海”  大沙漠腹地也有“动物世界”
    据新华社乌鲁木齐8月8日电　（记者申尊敬）中国科学院的一支沙漠科考队结束了对塔克拉玛干沙漠的考察后于最近宣布，在这个我国最大的沙漠腹地，至少发现有82种野生动物繁衍生息。这一新发现，对重新评估塔克拉玛干大沙漠的生态环境具有重要意义。
    本世纪初，瑞典人斯文赫定率一支探险队深入塔克拉玛干沙漠考察期间，只见到一只蚊子，由于没有发现其他生物，他认定，那只蚊虫也是附在人畜身上混进沙漠的。
    去年秋天，中科院组织综合考察队沿克里雅河进入沙漠腹心区。在考察期间，他们发现了野骆驼、赤狐、塔里木兔、各种大耳猬、沙鼠、跳鼠、白尾地鸦、白翅啄木鸟、文须犬、西域沙虎、绿蟾蜍、叶尔羌条鳅等动物80多种。这些动物分属兽类、鸟类、爬行类、两栖类和鱼类，其中90％是首次发现的。它们或昼伏夜出，或于白日觅食戏嬉，活动既频繁又诡秘。
    身躯高大的野骆驼是沙漠里的“兽中王”，冬季常七八十峰一群在大漠里悠然漫游，一遇风吹草动，便飞也似地消逝在沙海中。狡猾的狐狸则常于夜晚窜到石油工人的营房附近，寻食残羹剩菜。
    沙漠考察队的副研究员谷景和对记者说，沙漠腹地虽然极端干旱，但食物链很完整：植物靠长得出奇的根系从地下水中吸取水分；动物则从嚼食植物中获得水的补充；许多大动物吃小动物果腹，构成沙漠生态的特征。
