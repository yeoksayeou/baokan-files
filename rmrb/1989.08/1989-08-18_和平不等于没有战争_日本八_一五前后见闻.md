The topic of war and peace is discussed most frequently in Japan every August. This year marks the 44th anniversary of Japan's surrender and defeat in World War II. Since the beginning of August, television and newspaper reports on war and peace have been continuous, bookstores have set up special sections for related books, and discussion forums and street lectures have been held one after another. People are discussing the history of more than 40 years ago.

Two Mayors

The war issue, which has been debated for many years, ultimately comes down to whether or not to acknowledge that it was a war of aggression. This issue has become increasingly sensitive recently because two mayors of local governments have openly expressed their views on the matter.

One is Nagasaki Mayor Motoshima Hitoshi. He became a news figure last December for his statement that the Emperor had responsibility for the war. He has received numerous threatening phone calls and letters containing bullets. After Emperor Akihito met with domestic and foreign reporters in early August, Mayor Motoshima reiterated his views. He said that those in leadership positions at the time should bear responsibility for the war. Today, including the new Emperor, all citizens should face the issue of war responsibility. Mayor Motoshira has received more than 8,000 letters, with the majority expressing support and admiration for his courage.

The other is Tokyo's Horikiri Mayor Tomaru. Recently, he made a speech supporting Mayor Motoshima's views. Since then, he has been subjected to constant threats and intimidation, making it impossible for him to have a moment's peace. The police have therefore taken the same measure of 24-hour protection for Mayor Tomaru as they did for Mayor Motoshima.

Public opinion believes that the experiences of these two mayors who dare to speak out remind people that in this so-called democratic country of Japan, freedom of speech is also limited.

Two Consciousnesses

Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two cities that suffered atomic bombings, hold peace prayer meetings every August. The scenes of the atomic bomb's devastation in the exhibition hall are horrifying. The citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki hope that more people will understand the misfortune that the atomic bomb brought to these two cities, awakening people's consciousness to prevent the recurrence of war. Some enlightened individuals have offered some very enlightening perspectives. The chairman of the Shizuoka Prefectural Teachers' Union, Ito Masanori, believes that the materials collected in the Atomic Bomb Exhibition Hall are centered on the suffering of the Japanese people, using a "victim consciousness" to condemn the war. However, if one does not recognize that we were also perpetrators, and does not view history from a dual perspective, it will be difficult to grasp a correct historical view. He proposes establishing a comprehensive war museum to fully introduce the entire war, allowing more people to understand history completely.

On August 15, the reporter discussed the issue of visiting the Yasukuni Shrine with the secretary-general of the "Japan-China Friendship Veterans Association," Nagai Yoichiro. Nagai, who participated in the war of aggression against China, said that those who go to visit the Yasukuni Shrine are either unrepentant about the war of aggression or have ulterior motives, while some are praying for their relatives who died in the war. The problem is that having only a "victim consciousness" is not enough; one must also have a "perpetrator consciousness" to correctly understand that war.

Two Countries

On August 16, the reporter participated in a discussion forum held by the "Japan-Germany Peace Forum." Participants from West Germany and Japanese attendees discussed how Japan and West Germany had a similar unglamorous history in the past. Now, both Japan and West Germany are economically developed countries. The exchange between the two countries' people has special significance.

When discussing August 15 as Japan's "End of War Memorial Day," a West German teacher said that in West Germany, people frankly admit that May 8 is the "day of defeat," but Japan uses "end of war" instead of "defeat," indicating that Japan does not dare to face history.

Regarding history textbooks, a Japanese participant said that Japan's history textbooks have been revised several times, always avoiding the acknowledgment of the war of aggression. A West German journalist said that from Japan's history textbooks, it seems that the Japanese army accidentally entered China, and no one is to blame. In West German schools, the history of Nazi Germany is not avoided, although it is not discussed sufficiently, but Japan's history textbooks cannot be compared to it.

A West German mayor said that Japan and West Germany have similarities in the past and present. In the aspect that the roots of fascism have not completely withered, they also have similarities. The common task of the two countries' people is to defend peace and oppose war. Now, both Japan and West Germany are in a peaceful environment, but peace does not mean the absence of war!

These remarks are indeed thought-provoking.

### “和平不等于没有战争”——日本八·一五前后见闻

    “和平不等于没有战争”
    ——日本八·一五前后见闻
    本报记者　于青
    战争与和平这个话题，每年8月在日本议论最多。今年是第二次世界大战中日本战败投降44周年。进入8月以来，电视、报刊有关战争与和平的报道不断，书店里增设了有关图书专柜，讨论会和街头讲演也接二连三，人们在议论40多年前的那段历史。
    两位市长
    多年来一直讨论不休的战争问题，说到底，是承认不承认那是一场侵略战争。这个问题近来趋于敏感，是因为两位有地方自治体的市长对此直言己见。
    一位是长崎市长本岛等。因为去年12月发表天皇有战争责任的讲话而成为新闻人物。他曾接到多次恐吓电话和装有子弹的恐吓信。8月初明仁天皇会见国内外记者之后，本岛市长再次阐述自己的观点。他说，当年身处领导地位的人应该承担战争责任。在今天，包括新天皇在内的全体国民，都应该面对战争责任这个问题。本岛市长已经收到8000多封来信，其中多数来信对他的勇气表示支持和钦佩。
    另一位是东京都保谷市长都丸者也。前不久他发表了赞同本岛市长观点的讲话。之后，对他的威胁恐吓不断，使他终日不得安宁。警方因而不得不对都丸市长采取了与对本岛市长相同的24小时保护措施。
    舆论认为，两位敢于直言的市长的遭遇提醒人们所谓日本这个民主国家，言论自由也是有限的。
    两种意识
    广岛和长崎，这两座遭受原子弹轰炸的城市，每年8月都要举行祈祷和平大会。在原子弹爆炸资料馆里，原子弹的危害场面令人惨不忍睹。广岛和长崎的市民希望让更多的人了解原子弹给这两座城市造成的不幸，唤起人们不让战争重演的意识。一些有识之士从又一角度发表了一些很有启发意义的见解。静冈县教职员工会委员长伊藤正则认为，原子弹爆炸资料馆收集的资料，是以日本人受害为中心的，是以“受害者意识”控诉战争。但是，如果不认识到我们也是加害者，不从双重角度认识历史，就难以掌握正确的历史观。他提议建立一个综合的战争博物馆，全面介绍战争始末，让更多的人完整地了解历史。
    8月15日，记者与“日中友好旧军人会”事务局长永井洋二郎谈起参拜靖国神社问题。当年参加过侵华战争的永井说，前去参拜靖国神社的人，少数是对侵略战争毫无反省，甚至别有用心的，一部分是为战争中死去的亲人祈祷。问题在于，仅有“受害者意识”是不够的，同时具有“加害者意识”，才能正确认识那场战争。
    两个国家
    8月16日，记者参加了“日德和平论坛”举行的讨论会。来自西德的人士和与会的日本人谈起：过去，日本和西德有一段相同的不光彩历史。现在，日本和西德同属经济发达国家。两国人士相互交流，具有特殊意义。
    谈起8月15日是日本的“停战纪念日”时，一位西德教师说，在西德，人们都坦率地承认5月8日是“战败日”，日本不用“战败”而称“终战”，说明日本不敢正视历史。
    说到历史教科书，一位日本人士说，日本的历史教科书几经修改，始终回避承认侵略战争。一位西德记者说，从日本的历史教科书看，好像日本军队是偶然进入中国的，谁也不负责任。西德学校的历史教学中，并不回避纳粹德国那段历史，虽然谈不上充分，但日本的历史教科书完全不能与之相比。
    一位西德市长说，日本与西德过去和现在有共同点。在法西斯的毒根还未完全枯死这一点上也有相似之处。两国人民共同的课题是保卫和平，反对战争。现在日本和西德都处在和平环境中，但和平不等于没有战争！
    这一席话，确实引人深思。
