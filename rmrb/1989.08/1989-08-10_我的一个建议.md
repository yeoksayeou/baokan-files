Title: A Suggestion of Mine

I am a Marxist theoretical educator in my sixties. In the struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, I deeply feel that it is very important for old Marxist theoretical workers, especially some well-known and influential Marxist theorists, to maintain a strong party spirit and a humble and cautious attitude.

All our cadres, regardless of their rank, contributions, or abilities, should spend their later years according to the standards of party members and state cadres, setting a good example for cadres, the masses, and especially the younger generation. We must not damage our reputation or the authority of the party and government among cadres and the masses with incorrect statements or wrong actions. As one gets older, it is even more important to be cautious in speech and conduct. It is better to do nothing than to talk nonsense. Most of the retired comrades who have done party and administrative work now have an important influence on society, but their role is relatively limited. The situation is different for old Marxist theoretical workers, especially some well-known Marxist theorists. These comrades have theoretical knowledge, hold the pen, and can speak well. Their administrative positions are generally retired later, and even if they retire, they are either in this academic society or that research institute, and are still figures of varying sizes in the academic world. Therefore, their influence on society is much greater, and their role is much more important. We often see that a retired minister, provincial party secretary, or governor is almost unknown, while some of our old Marxist theorists are still writing big articles and giving big speeches, influencing cadres and the masses!

In this situation, we comrades should pay even more attention to maintaining a strong party spirit and a humble and cautious attitude. This means being a good Marxist theoretical worker who can uphold and develop Marxism-Leninism, neither becoming a rigid old man who treats Marxism as a dogma, nor becoming a person who denies the basic principles of Marxism and blindly worships some bourgeois philosophy and social theories to be fashionable. In the face of the bourgeois liberalization trend, we should not echo it, let alone add fuel to the fire, nor should we turn a blind eye and let it spread without saying a word. Of course, if there are things done wrong, in the struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, one should wake up and correct them. As long as one seriously corrects oneself, the party and the people will welcome and need one just the same. Seriously correcting one's mistakes in theoretical work, promoting achievements, overcoming shortcomings, and correcting errors is also a very important manifestation of maintaining a strong party spirit and a humble and cautious attitude. In short, we Marxist theoretical workers should cherish ourselves very much. This is also cherishing our social responsibility and the party and people's expectations and demands for us.

I believe that for Marxist theoretical workers to continue to maintain a strong party spirit and a humble and cautious attitude, the following issues must be addressed:

1. We must humbly and seriously study the important documents of the Party Central Committee and the works of the older generation of revolutionaries such as Deng Xiaoping. These contain the developed and living Marxism of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which will enrich and arm our minds. We should not just go in circles in some foreign books and journals, our own articles, and speeches. We should not think that our wisdom is superior to the collective wisdom of the party.

2. We should do some painstaking and detailed investigative research work and accumulate basic data. We should not just write empty and hollow things or express some patchwork-like thoughts.

3. We should study more practical problems in the construction of the two civilizations. We should not just make a big fuss about new terms and concepts. We have many concepts that need to be updated, and correspondingly, many terms and concepts also need to be developed. However, all of this must be guided by Marxism and uphold the Four Cardinal Principles. We should not use the name of updating concepts to actually defend or rehabilitate bourgeois ideas. The core of bourgeois ideology—individualism—cannot be justified. The concept of selflessness and the slogan of building the country through hard work and frugality, as well as many other revolutionary fine traditions and styles, can only be inherited and carried forward, not shaken or denied.

4. If one has already gained some fame or great fame, one should not strive for more fame or titles. If a report is written by other comrades and one only reads it, there is no need for one to read it personally; it is better to let other comrades give the speech. If an article or a book is mainly written by other comrades, let other comrades be the first author or the chief editor, and one can write a preface at most. This way, being objective and truthful, everyone will be happy.

5. Precisely because our comrades have gained some fame or great fame, they should pay even more attention to maintaining a strong party spirit and be more humble and cautious. They should not be arrogant because of their intelligence or proud because of their fame. When speaking or writing articles, one should think deeply and discuss seriously with other comrades. One should not be vague and speak impulsively. We should dare to speak and speak well. Both daring to speak and speaking well should be unified in obeying the constitution, the Four Cardinal Principles, and the party's political and propaganda disciplines. Under these conditions of obedience, we can fully fly like birds in the sky and swim like fish in the sea, practicing academic freedom, creative freedom, discussion freedom, and freedom of criticism and counter-criticism. In this free world, we can fully display our wisdom and contribute to upholding and developing Marxism.

    我的一个建议
    王伯惠
    我是一个六十多岁的党的马克思主义理论教育工作者。在坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的斗争中，深深感到：老的马克思主义的理论工作者，特别是一些老的知名的有影响的马克思主义理论家，注意保持坚强的党性，保持谦虚谨慎的作风，是一件很重要的事情。
    我们的全体干部，不论职位高低，贡献大小，能力强弱，都应按照党员标准和国家干部标准，度好自己的晚年，为干部和群众、特别是青年一代做个好样子。千万不能用不正确的言论和错误的行为去损害自己的名声，去损害党和政府在干部、群众中的威信。年纪老了，谨言慎行更为重要，宁可无所作为，也不要去胡说非为。曾经做过党和行政工作的已经离休的多数老同志，他们现在对社会的影响是重要的，但其作用相对来说毕竟是有限的。而老的马克思主义理论工作者，特别是一些知名的马克思主义理论家，情况就不同了。这些同志肚里有理论，手中有笔杆，嘴巴又会讲，行政职务一般也退的迟，就是退下来，不是在这个学会，就是在那个研究会，也是一个学术界的大小不等的头面人物。这样，就比其他老同志对社会的影响要大得多，作用也重要得多。我们常常可以看到，一个离休以后的部长、省委书记、省长已经鲜为人知了，而我们的一些老的马克思主义的理论家还在那里大写文章，大作报告，对干部和群众大施其影响哩！在这种情况下，我们这些同志就应当更加注意保持坚强的党性，保持谦虚谨慎的作风。这就是要做一个能够坚持和发展马克思列宁主义的比较好的理论工作者，既不能做一个把马克思主义当做教条的僵化的老人，更不能做一个否定马克思主义的基本原则，盲目崇拜资产阶级某些哲学和社会学说的赶“时髦”的人。在资产阶级自由化思潮面前，不能随声附和，甚至添油加醋，也不能熟视无睹，任其传播而不声不响。当然，有做得不好的地方，在坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化的斗争中，猛醒过来，改了就好。只要认真改正，党和人民是会照样欢迎和需要的。认真改正自己在理论工作上的错误，发扬成绩，克服缺点，纠正错误，也是保持坚强的党性和谦虚谨慎作风的非常重要的表现。总之，我们的马克思主义的理论工作者，要十分珍重自己。这也是珍重我们的社会责任，珍重党和人民对我们的希望和要求。
    马克思主义理论工作者继续保持坚强的党性和谦虚谨慎的作风，我认为有这样几个问题是必须注意解决的：一是要虚心地认真地学习党中央的重要文件和邓小平等老一辈革命家的著作，这里面有建设中国特色的社会主义的发展了的活生生的马克思主义，以此充实和武装自己的头脑。不要只是在外国一些书刊，自己的文章和讲话中兜圈子。更不要认为自己的智慧比党的集体智慧还要高明。二是要做一些艰苦细致的调查研究工作和基础资料的积累工作，不要只是写一些空空洞洞的东西，发一些东凑西拼的感想式的议论。三是要多研究些两个文明建设中的实际问题，不要只是在名词概念上大做花样翻新的文章。我们有许多观念要更新，相应的有不少名词概念也要发展，但是这些都要以马克思主义为指导，坚持四项基本原则，不要以观念更新为名，实际上是为资产阶级思想辩护或翻案。资产阶级思想的核心——个人主义，是不能为之正名的。党和工人阶级所倡导的大公无私的观念和勤俭建国的口号，以及其他许多革命的优良传统和作风，是只能继承和发扬而不能动摇和否定的。四是自己已小有名气或大有名气了，再不要去争名和挂名了。如果那个报告稿子是其他同志写的，自己只是照念而已，那就没有必要由自己亲自去念，还是让其他同志去讲为好；如果那篇文章或那本书主要是其他同志写的，就让其他同志为首署名或当主编，自己最多写个序言就行了。这样，实事求是，岂不皆大喜欢。五是正因为我们的同志已经有了一点小名气或大名气，所以更应当注意保持坚强的党性，更加谦虚谨慎，不要持智而骄，持名而傲。讲话，写文章，总要深思熟虑，和其他同志认真商议，不要大而化之，灵机一动，随口而言。我们既要敢言，更要善言，敢言和善言都要统一在遵守宪法，遵守四项基本原则，遵守党的政治纪律和宣传纪律上面。在这几个遵守的条件下，我们完全能够天高任鸟飞，海阔凭鱼跃，实行学术自由，创作自由，讨论自由，批评和反批评自由，在自由的天地里充分发挥自己的聪明才智，为坚持和发展马克思主义作出一定贡献。
