Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 12th.

Taiwan has decided to send a team to participate in the Asian Handball Championship to be held in Beijing.

Taipei, August 11th—The Chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, Zhang Fengxi, announced that Taiwan has decided to send a team to participate in the Asian Handball Championship to be held in Beijing.

Zhang Fengxi said, “Our athletes participating in the Asian Handball Championship in Beijing is safe.” He stated that this decision was made after the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee evaluated the recently concluded Asian Boxing Championship in Beijing, indicating that there are no safety issues.

Zhang Fengxi further stated that allowing the handball team to participate in Beijing is a special case and does not represent that all official competitions held on the mainland will be attended. In the future, all Taiwanese sports teams must first be evaluated by the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee before they can register. This will avoid the unfavorable consequences of being penalized by the Asian Sports Association for registering and then not participating.

The Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee has decided to appoint Vice Secretary-General Zhan Deji to lead the men's and women's handball teams to Beijing for the competition. Zhan Deji led the Taiwanese youth gymnastics team to Beijing in April to participate in the Asian Youth Games, marking the resumption of sports exchanges between the two sides.

    台湾决定派队参加亚洲手球赛
    新华社香港8月12日电　台北消息：中国台北奥委会主席张丰绪11日宣布，台湾已决定派队参加在北京举行的亚洲手球锦标赛。
    张丰绪说：“我们的运动员参加北京亚洲手球锦标赛是安全的。”他说，这是中国台北奥委会在评估最近于北京结束的亚洲拳击锦标赛后作出的决定，说明安全并无问题。
    张丰绪又称，准许手球队赴北京参赛是个案办理，并不代表在大陆举行的正式比赛都会参加。今后台湾各体育团队必须先通过中国台北奥委会评估后才准报名，如此将可避免报名后不参赛而遭亚洲运动协会处分的不利后果。
    中国台北奥委会已决定指派副秘书长詹德基率男、女手球队赴北京参赛。詹德基今年4月曾率领台湾青年体操队来京参加亚青赛。两岸体育从此恢复交流。
