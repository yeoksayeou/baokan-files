According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics for 42 large and medium-sized cities, the vegetable production in these cities in the first half of this year has continued to grow steadily, with vegetable output increasing and market price increases significantly lower than last year.

The total vegetable production in these 42 cities in the first half of this year reached 13.28 million tons, continuing to grow by 7% on the basis of last year's increase. On a per capita basis for urban areas, the average daily vegetable consumption per person increased from 0.73 kilograms last year to 0.77 kilograms this year. The main reasons for the increase in vegetable production are the expansion of planting areas and the improvement of yield per unit area.

Additionally, statistics show that in the first half of this year, the average social retail price of vegetables in these 42 cities was 84 yuan per 100 kilograms, an increase of 19.1% compared to the same period last year. This is a reduction of 12.9 percentage points compared to the 32% increase in the same period last year. Notably, cities such as Nanjing, Qingdao, and Wuhan, which had price increases of over 40% last year, saw significant reductions in their price increases. Cities like Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Fuzhou had vegetable prices lower than the same period last year.

According to analysis, the main reasons for the slowdown in vegetable price increases in large and medium-sized cities in the first half of the year are: first, both vegetable production and market supply increased; second, leadership and management of vegetable production and sales were strengthened, measures were taken to stabilize vegetable planting areas, and efforts were made to smooth out supply channels; third, the supply from state-owned vegetable companies increased, continuing to play a role in stabilizing vegetable prices.

    大中城市蔬菜增产  价格涨幅明显回落
    本报北京8月4日讯  今年上半年，我国大中城市蔬菜生产持续稳定增长，蔬菜产量增加，市场价格上涨幅度明显低于去年。
    据国家统计局对42个大中城市统计，今年上半年蔬菜产量达1328万吨，在去年增长的基础上，继续增长7％。按城区人口计算，平均每人每天占有蔬菜量由去年的0.73公斤增加到0.77公斤。蔬菜产量增加的主要原因是面积扩大，单产提高。
    另据统计，这42个城市，上半年蔬菜社会零售价格平均每百公斤为84元，比去年同期增长19.1％，比去年上半年较前年同期增长32％的幅度缩小12.9个百分点。特别是去年上涨幅度在四成以上的城市如南京、青岛、武汉等，涨幅明显降低。天津、太原、福州等城市的菜价则低于去年同期。
    据分析，上半年大中城市菜价上涨幅度回落的主要原因：一是实现了蔬菜产量和上市量双增长；二是对蔬菜产销加强了领导和管理，采取措施稳定蔬菜面积，同时注意疏通流通渠道；三是国营蔬菜公司供应量增加，继续发挥了平抑菜价的作用。
