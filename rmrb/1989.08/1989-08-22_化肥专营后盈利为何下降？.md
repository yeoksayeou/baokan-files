Since the implementation of specialized fertilizer sales, 7 out of 14 county supply and marketing cooperatives in Bijie Region, Guizhou Province, have incurred severe losses. Why have their profits decreased significantly?

Originally, the transportation cost for fertilizer was set at 0.18 to 0.23 yuan per ton per kilometer. Now, it has risen to 0.40 to 0.60 yuan. Additionally, some drivers charge a handling fee of 30 to 60 yuan for transporting one ton of fertilizer. The normal transportation cost for one ton of fertilizer from Sichuan Red Star Fertilizer Factory to Bijie is 60 yuan, but with the additional unreasonable fees, the transportation cost per ton of fertilizer has reached over 180 yuan. Currently, some supply and marketing cooperatives incur a loss of 127 yuan for every ton of fertilizer they sell.

The state price for one ton of nitrogen fertilizer is set at 780 yuan, but some sales departments sell it for around 1300 yuan, with the extra 500 yuan not issued with a receipt, making it impossible for the supply and marketing departments to account for this part of the fertilizer, which accounts for 70% of the demand.

It is suggested that relevant departments take measures to reduce the burden on farmers and the losses of supply and marketing cooperatives.

    化肥专营后盈利为何下降？
    化肥实行专营以来，我省毕节地区14个县供销社，有7个出现严重亏损。这些单位的盈利为何大幅度下降呢？
    原规定化肥每吨公里运费0.18元至0.23元，而现在上升到0.40元至0.60元。此外，有些驾驶员运送1吨化肥，要收取辛苦费30元至60元。从四川赤天化肥厂运1吨化肥到毕节的正常运费为60元，现在加上不合理的费用每吨化肥的运费达180多元。目前，有些供销社经营1吨化肥要亏损127元。
    国家每吨氮肥定价780元，而有的销售部门却卖到1300元左右，多收的500多元还不给发票，使供销部门无法入帐。这部分化肥占需求量的70％。
    建议有关部门采取措施，以减轻农民负担和供销社的亏损。
