Some inland waterways have become narrower due to sunken ships and other reasons. The Yangtze River, known as the "Golden Waterway," is facing this serious situation.

How many ships have sunk in the Yangtze River? On November 10, 1986, the *Information Daily* reported that since records began in 1900, over 360 ships have sunk in the Yangtze River in the past 80 years, with over 200 of these sinking before liberation.

Experts analyze that this number is conservative. According to relevant data, from 1987 to October 1988, 148 ships sank in the downstream area. In 1987, the Yangtze River experienced 403 maritime accidents, resulting in 183 sunken ships. In December 1988 and January 1989, 35 ships sank in the Yangtze River main channel in just two months.

The above data is based on information from relevant departments, and there are many more sunken ships that have not been reported. Therefore, the actual number of sunken ships far exceeds the reported number. No one can accurately say how many ships have sunk in the Yangtze River, just as no one can accurately say how many unlicensed vessels are on the river.

Sunken ships have seriously endangered the safe navigation of vessels. On June 3, 1984, the Yichang Shipping Company's ship No. 202 capsized at Daxikou, causing the "Shenfeng" ship to be damaged and sink on March 7, 1985. In the dry season of 1987, a machine-sailboat from Jiangsu Province sank after hitting the sunken ship No. 223 while traveling downstream from Guazi Island to Madang. On June 11, 1988, a ship with the number 4126 from Huoqiu County sank at Fanjiantian, becoming a "hidden reef." In less than a month, more than ten vessels were damaged or sank after hitting this "hidden reef."

A significant portion of the sunken ships in the Yangtze River are due to unseaworthy vessels. In 1988, there were 470 maritime accidents on the Yangtze River main channel. Among these accidents, collective and individual-owned ships accounted for the largest share. Out of 533 inspected ships, only four were deemed qualified. According to an analysis of the ten ships that sank in the 205-kilometer section of the Honghu waterway over the past two years, seven of these ships entered the Yangtze River main channel from tributaries such as the Xiangjiang and Hanjiang rivers. Three of these ships ran aground outside the navigation channel, while the rest sank due to operational errors.

Disorderly management and neglect of safety are also causes of sunken ships. For example, this spring, the frenzy of eel fishing in Jiangsu resulted in 27 ships sinking and 72 people losing their lives.

    长江沉船问题调查
    有些内河航道由于沉船及其他原因，由宽变窄，被称为黄金水道的长江干线航道，就面临这一严峻形势。
    长江有多少沉船？一九八六年十一月十日《信息日报》报道，从一九○○年长江有沉船记载以来的八十多年里，据不完全统计，躺在江底的沉船已达三百六十多艘，其中解放前有二百多艘。
    专家分析，这个数字是保守的。据有关资料表明：一九八七年至一九八八年十月间，下游共沉船一百四十八艘。一九八七年长江共发生海损事故四百零三件，沉船一百八十三艘。一九八八年十二月份和一九八九年元月份的两个月内，长江干线就沉船三十五艘。
    以上资料只是根据有关单位所掌握的数据，还有不少沉船没有上报。因此实际沉船数远远超过掌握数。长江到底有多少沉船，就像长江上无证船舶那样，谁也说不清。
    沉船已严重危害船舶安全航行。一九八四年六月三日，宜昌航运公司二○二轮在大溪口翻沉，导致一九八五年三月七日“神峰”号轮被沉船触损进水；一九八七年枯水季江苏省一机帆船从瓜子洲下行至马当被二二三号沉船触损沉没；一九八八年六月十一日，霍邱县挂四一二六号船在凡家矾沉没成为一座“暗礁”，在不到一个月内，就有十多艘船舶被这座“暗礁”触损或被触坏沉没。
    长江沉船相当一部分是与不适航的船舶有关。一九八八年长江干线海损事故达四百七十件，在这些事故中，集体和个体户船舶比重最大。在检查的五百三十三艘船舶中，合格的只有四艘。根据洪湖航道段辖区二百零五公里河段上近两年来沉没的十艘船舶分析：有七艘分别是从湘江、汉江等支流进入长江干线的船舶，除三艘在航道外搁浅，其余均为操作不当翻沉。
    水上管理混乱，忽视安全也是沉船的原因之一。比如今年春天，在江苏境内出现的捕鳗狂潮，就使二十七艘船舶沉入江底，七十二人丧命。
