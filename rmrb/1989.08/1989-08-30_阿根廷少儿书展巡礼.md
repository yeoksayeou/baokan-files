July is winter in Argentina, and schools are on holiday. The Argentine Book Foundation held its first children's book fair in the capital. The fair was held in the traditional agricultural and livestock exhibition grounds, where transportation is convenient, and the fair can increase sales. Publishers were very enthusiastic about participating, with dozens of publishing houses setting up booths. In addition to China, some foreign embassies were also invited to set up stalls to sell books. Children, led by their parents or grandparents, eagerly entered the exhibition hall. As soon as they entered, each child received a circular badge with "I Love Reading" printed on it. The children proudly wore it on their chests and excitedly dove into the sea of books. Here, from fairy tales and fables to detective and science fiction novels, from comic books to large volumes of children's encyclopedias, everything was available.

Young children eagerly flipped through colorful comic books, but they had little autonomy and usually relied on adults to decide whether to buy. Students in grades five and six were more independent and could freely choose and purchase books. The Chinese booth was one of the most attractive stalls. The omnipotent Monkey King was also admired by Argentine children, while parents preferred Chinese fables filled with Eastern wisdom. To attract children, some booths hired young women who could sing, play the guitar, and tell stories to help sell books. The sound of the guitar indeed drew many children.

In addition to selling books, the organizing committee arranged various colorful activities related to reading or stimulating children's intelligence. As soon as the poetry and fable recitation ended on this side of the door, a children's song class began on the other side. A small theater was set up in the exhibition area to perform children's plays, puppet shows, and other cultural programs. One booth had no books but taught children how to make toys from discarded plastic bottles or stimulate their imagination through painting. When children were engrossed in intelligence games, parents could attend lectures by experts on how to inspire and guide children's reading, or freely participate in discussions on children's education and child psychology. Both adults and children found something to enjoy. The book fair is a commercial activity, but the organizers made it culturally rich, truly putting in a lot of effort. This is also inseparable from the support of various sectors of society. Cultural workers and child workers mostly volunteered to serve the children without compensation.

    阿根廷少儿书展巡礼
    本报记者　李志明
    七月是阿根廷的冬天，学校放寒假。阿根廷图书基金会在首都举办首届少年儿童书展。书展在传统的农牧展场地举行，这里交通方便，书展可以提高营业额，参展书商十分踊跃，几十家出版社设置了摊位，包括中国在内的一些外国大使馆也应邀在这里设台售书。孩子们在爸爸妈妈或爷爷奶奶的带领下，兴高彩烈地走进展厅。一进门，每个孩子便得到一张圆形标志，上面印着“我爱读书”，孩子们自豪地把它贴在胸前，喧嚷着钻进书的海洋。这里从童话、寓言到侦探、科幻小说，从小人书连环画到大部头的成套儿童百科全书，应有尽有。
    幼龄儿童津津有味地翻看彩色“小人书”，他们自主权不多，买不买通常由大人决定。五六年级的小学生较为独立，可以自由选购。中国展台是最吸引人的摊位之一。神通广大的美猴王同样受到阿根廷孩子们的崇拜，家长们则更喜欢充满东方人智慧的中国寓言。为了吸引小朋友，有的展台聘请了能弹善唱会讲故事的女青年帮助卖书，吉他声一响果然引来不少小朋友。
    组织委员会除了售书还安排了多彩的活动，都与读书或启发儿童智力有关。大门这边诗歌和寓言朗诵刚完，那边又开始教唱儿童歌曲。展览场地中还辟出小剧场，演出儿童剧、木偶戏和其他文艺节目。有一个展台没有书，而是教孩子们怎样利用废弃的塑料瓶等制作玩具，或是通过绘画启发孩子们的想象力。当孩子们饶有兴趣地做着智力游戏时，家长们可以去听专家举办的讲座，题目是怎样启发和指导儿童读书，也可以自由参加儿童教育儿童心理讨论会。大人孩子各得其所。书展是一种商业活动，但组织者把它办得具有浓厚的文化气息，确实花了很大力气，这也是同社会各界的支持分不开的。文艺工作者、儿童工作者大都是不取报酬志愿来为孩子们服务的。
