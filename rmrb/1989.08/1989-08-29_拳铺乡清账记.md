On April 28, Li Wenrun, the Party Secretary of Quanpu Township in our county, received a letter of complaint. The letter reported that the financial management of Wuzhuang Village was chaotic, and village cadres had privately increased and misappropriated farmers' levies, demanding that the township send someone to investigate and handle the matter.

Li Wenrun immediately convened a meeting with the cadres and masses of Wuzhuang Village to understand the situation. It was confirmed that the issues reported in the letter were basically true. Therefore, the township Party Committee held an emergency meeting that night and decided to establish a township audit team to enter Wuzhuang Village. The investigation revealed that the village accountant, Guo Sicong, had privately occupied and lent out more than 3,000 yuan of the villagers' levies and more than 1,000 yuan of construction subsidies for villagers. The village Party branch secretary, Sun Zhonghe, had privately stored more than 1,000 yuan of public funds. The township Party Committee promptly handled these issues, adjusted the leadership team of Wuzhuang Village, and helped the village formulate financial management regulations and improve the accounting system.

The problems in Wuzhuang Village were quickly resolved, but the township Party Committee did not stop there. They realized that Wuzhuang's problems reflected the chaotic state of village-level financial management in rural areas. The township Party Committee decided to take this opportunity to conduct a comprehensive financial audit in all 33 administrative villages in the township. The audit revealed that 7 villages had issues, with a total of 67,000 yuan in disciplinary violations and 80,000 yuan in national savings bonds that had been withheld from farmers being returned to the people.

This comprehensive financial audit in the township had a strong impact on the masses. Some farmers happily said, "In the past, when we paid levies, the village cadres took as much as they wanted, and we had no idea how the money was spent. This time, we finally understand!"

    拳铺乡清账记
    4月28日，我县拳铺乡党委书记李文运收到一封举报信。信中反映吴庄村财务管理混乱，村干部私自增加、挪用农民提留款，要求乡里派人查处。
    李文运立即找吴庄村的干部群众座谈了解，证明信中反映的情况基本属实。于是，乡党委连夜召开党委会，决定成立乡清查小组进驻吴庄。经查，发现村会计郭思连私自占用和外借群众的提留款3000多元以及村民施工补助费1000多元，村党支部书记孙中和将1000多元公款私存等问题。对此，乡党委及时作了处理，调整了吴庄村领导班子，并帮助这个村制订了财务管理制度，健全了账目。
    吴庄村的问题很快解决了，但乡党委并未就此罢休。他们意识到，吴庄的问题反映了农村村级财务管理的混乱状况。乡党委决定举一反三，趁热打铁，在全乡33个行政村中开展一次财务大检查。结果发现有7个村存在问题，查纠违纪金额6.7万元，扣发农民的8万多元国库券也退还给群众。
    这次全乡财务大清查，在群众中引起了强烈反响。有的农民高兴地说：“过去交提留，村干部要多少，俺交多少，一本糊涂账，更不知提留款是怎么花的，这回俺心里算明白啦！”
