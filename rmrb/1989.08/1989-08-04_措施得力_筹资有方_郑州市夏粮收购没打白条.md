This year, the demand for grain and oil procurement funds in our city reached over 63 million yuan, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. At the same time, due to the "circulation of funds outside the system," various forms of fundraising are frequent, and rural reserves are diverted, resulting in a significant shortage of agricultural and sideline products. To ensure the funds needed for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, the Agricultural Bank of Zhengzhou has taken various measures to raise funds. Currently, the summer grain and oil procurement task in our city has been fully completed, and the Agricultural Bank has already settled over 40 million yuan in grain and oil payments to farmers in our city, without issuing a single IOU.

The Agricultural Bank of Zhengzhou has taken the following measures:

	1.	Strive for savings deposits. Since April, the Agricultural Bank has launched a savings civilized and high-quality service month activity in urban and rural areas across the city, establishing savings consultation service stations in the city area, which are well received by depositors. By the end of June, the balance of savings deposits in towns across the city had reached 457.37 million yuan, an increase of 102.49 million yuan from the beginning of the year, completing the savings plan by 150.7%.

	2.	Reduce the scale of credit. Since the beginning of the year, the Agricultural Bank has taken measures to reduce the scale of credit, adjust the credit structure, and vigorously collect overdue loans. For enterprises and individuals with the ability to repay but not actively repaying loans, forced deductions are made; for enterprises and borrowers unable to repay, either find guarantors (units) to take responsibility or promote them to take the path of auction, merger, or joint operation; for "difficult customers" and "nail customers" who have money but do not repay loans, legal action is taken to recover the loans. From January to June, the Agricultural Bank has collected and recovered various types of overdue loans totaling 61.273 million yuan, ensuring the funding needs for spring and summer agricultural production and preparing a portion of the funds for the summer grain and oil procurement.

	3.	Collect and squeeze occupied and misappropriated funds. Starting in early May, the Agricultural Bank organized county branches and urban offices to investigate the operation of grain, supply and marketing departments' grain and oil, tobacco, and other agricultural procurement loans, and found cases of occupied and misappropriated agricultural procurement funds. They promptly reported this to the municipal government and the People's Bank of China, prompting the municipal government to intervene and coordinate, requiring the implementation of fund sources according to higher-level regulations, and initially raising 65 million yuan. Subsequently, the financial department also promptly allocated 13.27 million yuan; the grain and oil, tobacco, supply and marketing, and other departments tapped potential funds of 40 million yuan. In the process of procuring this summer's grain and oil, the Agricultural Bank of Zhengzhou, together with the People's Bank and the grain department, formed a mobile service team, conducted on-site offices in various counties and districts, and promoted the summer grain and oil procurement work.

    措施得力　筹资有方
    郑州市夏粮收购没打白条
    今年，我市粮油收购资金需求量达6300多万元，比去年同期增加15％。同时，由于资金“体外循环”，各种形式的集资频繁，农村储源分流，造成农副产品缺口很大。为了切实保证收购农副产品所需资金，郑州市农业银行千方百计进行筹集。目前，我市夏季粮油定购任务已全面完成，市农行现已给我市农民结算粮油款4000多万元，没有给农民打一张白条。
    市农业银行采取了以下措施：
    狠抓储蓄存款。4月以来，市农行在全市城乡开展储蓄文明优质服务月活动，在市区建立储蓄咨询服务站，深受储户欢迎。截至6月底，全市集镇储蓄存款余额已达45737万元，比今年初净增10249万元，完成储蓄计划的150.7％。
    压缩信贷规模。年初以来，市农行采取措施，压缩信贷规模，调整信贷结构，大力清收非正常贷款。对有偿还能力而不积极归还贷款的企业和个人强行扣款；对无力还款的企业和贷户或找担保人（单位）担负，或促使其走拍卖、兼并、联营之路；对有钱不还贷的“难缠户”、“钉子户”依法起诉，收回贷款。1月至6月，市农行共清理收回各种非正常贷款6127.3万元，不仅保证了春夏农业生产的资金需求，还为夏季粮油收购准备了一部分资金。
    清收挤占挪用。5月上旬开始，市农行组织各县支行和市区办事处调查了粮食、供销部门的粮油、烟草等农采贷款的运行情况，发现有挤占挪用农采资金情况，对此，他们及时向市政府和市人民银行作了汇报，促使市政府出面协调，要求按照上级的规定落实资金来源，并率先筹措了6500万元。紧接着，财政部门也及时拨款1327万元；粮油、烟草、供销等部门挖潜4000万元。在收购今年夏季粮油的工作中，郑州市农业银行会同人民银行、粮食部门组成流动服务队，深入各县、区现场办公，促进了夏季粮油收购工作的进行。
