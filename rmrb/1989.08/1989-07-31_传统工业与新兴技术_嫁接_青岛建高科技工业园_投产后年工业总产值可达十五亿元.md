Qingdao is set to build a high-tech industrial park. The city's new technology industrial development experimental zone has recently been approved by the State Science and Technology Commission and officially established.

It is understood that the main purpose of Qingdao's establishment of the new technology industrial development experimental zone is to introduce the new technology research achievements of various universities, research institutions, and large and medium-sized enterprises in Qingdao into the experimental zone for "incubation," forming technological products or technological products, developing factory enterprises and scientific research institutions, and higher education institutions. Cooperation, thereby promoting Qingdao's product structure and industrial structure to gradually transform towards a technology-intensive direction, making labor-intensive and traditional industries "graft" with new technologies, forming a high-tech industrial park.

This new technology industrial development experimental zone is located in the "Science and Technology Industrial Zone" of Qingdao Economic and Technological Development Zone, covering an area of 82.5 hectares. The experimental zone will adopt a phased implementation and rolling development approach. From 1989 to 1995, the first phase of the project will cover 30 hectares of construction land, with a ground building area of 120,000 square meters and a basic engineering investment of 26.25 million yuan; from 1995 to 2000, the second phase of the project will cover 52.5 hectares of construction land, with a ground building area of 500,000 square meters and infrastructure investment of 52 million yuan. In the initial stage, it is planned to create 100 new technology development enterprises, develop 200 new technology products, accommodate 2,000 high and middle-level technical personnel, raise 200 million yuan for new technology development funds, and achieve an annual industrial output value of 1.5 billion yuan after production, with exports and import substitution accounting for more than 40%.

According to the decision of the Qingdao Municipal Government in 1988 on the establishment of the Qingdao New Technology Industrial Development Experimental Zone, all units that establish science and technology development economic entities within the experimental zone, in addition to enjoying the relevant preferential policies approved by the State Council in 1988 "Provisional Regulations on the Beijing New Technology Industrial Development Experimental Zone" and the "Decision on Deepening the Reform of the Science and Technology System" issued by the Qingdao Municipal Government in 1988, can also enjoy similar preferential policies for foreign-funded enterprises.

    传统工业与新兴技术“嫁接”
    青岛建高科技工业园
    投产后年工业总产值可达十五亿元
    本报讯　青岛市将兴建高科技工业园。该市新技术产业开发试验区最近经国家科委批复正式成立。
    据悉，青岛市设立新技术产业开发试验区的主要目的，是把驻青岛各高校、科研机构和全市大中新型企业的新技术研究成果引入试验区“孵化”，形成技术商品或技术产品，发展工厂企业与科研机构、高等院校的联合，从而推动青岛市产品结构、产业结构逐步向技术密集型的方向转化，使劳动密集型、传统工业与新技术“嫁接”，形成一个高科技工业园。
    这个新技术产业开发试验区设在青岛经济技术开发区的“科技工业区”内，占地82.5公顷。试验区将采取分期实施、滚动发展的办法，从1989年至1995年的一期工程，建设用地30公顷，地面建筑面积1.2万平方米，基础工程投资2625万元；从1995年至2000年的二期工程，建设用地52.5公顷，地面建筑面积5万平方米，基础设施投资5200万元。起步阶段，计划创建新技术开发企业100家，开发新技术产品200种，接纳高、中级科技人员2000人，筹集新技术开发资金2亿元，投产后年工业总产值可达15亿元，其中出口创汇和可替代进口总值占40％以上。
    根据1988年青岛市政府关于成立青岛市新技术产业开发试验区的决定，凡在试验区内创办科技开发型经济实体的单位，除享受国务院1988年批准的《北京市新技术产业开发试验区暂行条例》、青岛市政府1988年颁布的《关于深化科技体制改革的决定》中的有关优惠政策外，还可享受类似外资企业的优惠政策。
