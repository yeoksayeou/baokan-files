The Sri Lankan newspaper "Observer Weekly" reported on the 13th that approximately 1.6 million residents in nine districts of this country are suffering from the worst drought in recent years.

The areas most severely affected are the Anuradhapura district in the North Central Province, the Kurunegala district in the Western Province, and the Trincomalee district in the Eastern Province. A nine-month-long severe drought has caused rivers to dry up and crops to wither.

    斯160万人遭受旱灾
    斯里兰卡《观察家报星期刊》13日报道，这个国家的9个区约160万居民遭受近几年来最大的旱灾。
    遭灾最严重的是北中央省的阿努拉达普拉区、西方省的库鲁内加拉区和东方省的亭可马里区。历时9个月的大旱使得这些地区的河流干枯，庄稼干死。
