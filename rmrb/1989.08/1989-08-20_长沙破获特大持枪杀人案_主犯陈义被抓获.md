A major gun-related murder case that shocked Changsha was solved early this morning by the public security authorities. The main culprit, Chen Yi, who was carrying two guns, was apprehended, and all the murder weapons were seized.

On the evening of August 13, Chen Yi, a released convict, and a local youth named Peng Yang, both armed, went to the Xiangjiang Hotel's outdoor dining area in the bustling downtown of Changsha. Due to past gambling disputes, they had a heated argument with an individual entrepreneur named Liu Runxing. Both sides drew their guns and firecracker guns, and in the midst of shouting and chasing, Chen and Peng, disregarding the more than a hundred diners in the restaurant, fired seven shots at Liu Runxing, killing him on the spot. They also shot and killed another individual entrepreneur who was dining nearby.

After the incident, the Changsha Public Security Bureau quickly mobilized forces, layer by layer, to rally the public. They set up a tight net in Changsha and its surrounding areas. The accomplice, Peng Yang, surrendered to the public security bureau on August 15 and led the police to retrieve a handgun and five bullets. Early this morning, the public security authorities captured the main culprit, Chen Yi, near the Xiangjiang Bridge on Shui Lu Zhou.
