The railway department and local government have joined forces to severely punish railway freight thieves in Hunan.

"To get rich, steal from the railway, become a millionaire overnight," this is a popular saying among those who specialize in stealing railway goods. Along the sides of the Jingguang Railway in Hunan, a group of thieves have already become wealthy. Some have accumulated vast fortunes, while others have built villas near the railway.

The rampant criminal activities have made Hunan a major disaster area for the Jingguang Railway. This year, the Xiangnan section of the Changsha Railway Bureau has suffered cargo theft losses amounting to over 3.9 million yuan, exceeding the total losses for the past 39 years since the founding of the nation.

In July, the Hunan Provincial Government and the Changsha Railway Bureau took joint action, adopting decisive measures to rectify railway security and severely crack down on railway cargo thieves. The director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau led a team to inspect the railway lines and deploy rectification plans. The Changsha Railway Bureau dispatched 400 people to form 9 working groups, which were sent to various stations within the jurisdiction to strengthen anti-theft forces. With the cooperation of local governments along the railway, over 100 cases have been solved in a month, 96 theft gangs have been dismantled, and 425 criminals have been arrested.

The railway department also targeted internal theft as a breakthrough in this crackdown on cargo theft. At the Zhuzhou North Station, a group of internal thieves were caught. These individuals had long been colluding with thieves to commit crimes, with one person alone stealing goods worth 90,000 yuan.

    铁路部门与地方政府联手
    湖南严惩铁路货运窃犯
    本报长沙8月6日电　“要发财，偷铁路，一夜变成万元户”，这是流行于专门盗窃铁路货物不法分子中间的顺口溜。在京广线湖南段两侧，一批盗货不法之徒已经暴富起来，他们有的腰缠万贯，有的在铁路旁盖起了小洋楼。
    猖獗的犯罪活动，使湖南成为京广铁路的重灾区。今年以来，京广线长沙铁路分局的湘南段，货盗损失达390多万元，超过该区段建国39年的损失总额。
    进入7月份，湖南省政府和长沙铁路分局联合行动，采取果断措施整治铁路治安，严厉打击铁路货盗罪犯。省公安厅厅长带队巡查铁路沿线，部署整治方案。长铁分局抽调400多人组成9个工作组，分赴管内车站充实反盗力量。在铁路沿线地方政府配合下，一个月来，全线破案100多起，摧毁盗窃团伙96个，抓获罪犯425人。
    铁路部门还把反内盗作为这次打击货盗的突破口。株洲北站查获一批内盗职工，这些人长期勾结盗窃分子作案，其中一人盗货折款达9万元。
