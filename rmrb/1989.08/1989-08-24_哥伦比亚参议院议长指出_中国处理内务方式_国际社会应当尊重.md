Gilardo made these remarks during a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Colombia Wang Wengsheng. He expressed his satisfaction that China's problems have been properly resolved.

He pointed out that although some international organizations have used their propaganda machines to try to isolate China in the international community, due to the increased contacts and exchanges between Colombia and China, the Colombian government has its own objective views on the matter.

He said that during his two recent visits to China, he saw that due to the adoption of a wise policy of opening up to the outside world, China's economy is developing rapidly. He firmly believes that any temporary difficulties cannot prevent China's economy from moving towards its predetermined goals.

    中国处理内务方式  国际社会应当尊重
    新华社波哥大8月22日电  哥伦比亚参议院议长路易斯·吉列尔莫·希拉尔多今天指出，国际社会应该尊重中国政府解决国内问题所采取的政策和措施。
    吉列尔莫·希拉尔多议长是今天会见中国驻哥伦比亚大使王嵎生时讲这番话的。他对中国的问题得到妥善解决表示高兴。
    他指出，尽管一些国际组织利用它们的宣传机器企图在国际社会中孤立中国，但由于哥、中两国之间增加了接触和互通情况，使哥伦比亚政府对事物有自己客观的看法。
    他说，他最近两次访问中国时看到，由于采取了明智的对外开放政策，中国经济发展很快。他坚信，任何暂时困难都不能阻止中国经济朝着预定的目标发展。
