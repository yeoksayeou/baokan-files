47 young religious figures who have mastered a certain level of Tibetan Buddhist knowledge have graduated after three years of diligent study, becoming the first batch of graduates from the Qinghai Tibetan Buddhist Academy.

These monks were selected through a unified examination to become the first batch of students at the Qinghai Tibetan Buddhist Academy. Qinghai Province has over 800,000 Tibetan Buddhist followers. To promote Tibetan Buddhism and inherit and develop Tibetan cultural heritage, Qinghai Province officially established the Tibetan Buddhist Academy in September 1986, located at the Kumbum Monastery.
