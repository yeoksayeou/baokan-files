The Party Committee of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) stood firm in the face of the tumultuous situation, confidently educating its employees to support the Party and socialism, and clearly opposing the turmoil. The 140,000 employees firmly supported the decisions of the Central Committee, stayed at their posts, and thwarted the plot of a few bad elements to "disrupt WISCO, disrupt Wuhan, and shake the nation." This not only once again proved that China's industrial workers are the backbone that the Party relies on, but also reiterated that ideological and political work is indeed the lifeline of the Party.

Educating the people of the nation to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, to persist with reform and opening up, and to become a new generation with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, is the essence of ideological and political work in the new era. However, in recent years, some places have relaxed their ideological and political work, leading to the spread of bourgeois liberalization. Some individuals with extreme self-awareness get angry at the mention of "ideological education," saying, "Who are you educating? What do you know?" Some "elites" even use imported concepts of "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" to mislead the masses, making people feel that being educated is a disgrace, a disrespect to "individual will" and "wisdom," thus developing a sense of aversion and resistance to ideological education. In such an atmosphere, some Party organizations are not so confident in carrying out ideological education and lack awareness in opposing bourgeois liberalization. As a result, on the solemn platform of the Communist Party and in the halls of science, there was once a strange phenomenon where Marxism-Leninism was ignored, and the bizarre theories of bourgeois liberalization were welcomed. Is this not worth pondering?

During the turmoil and riots in Beijing, some misled masses developed confused ideas and even sympathized with some erroneous behaviors. Fundamentally, this is related to the previous period of lax ideological education. This lesson is very painful. Those who were not so confident in carrying out ideological education should reflect seriously. Is it not a wake-up call? In a China under the leadership of the Communist Party, educating the masses to support the Party's leadership; in a China where the socialist system has been firmly established, educating the masses to persist with the socialist path, is a natural and reasonable thing. The Chinese people have followed the Communist Party, endured so much hardship, and shed so much blood, all for the realization of this wish. How is it that, in a situation where the socialist system has achieved great success, and especially where the Party's reform and opening-up policies have significantly improved people's lives, there is a lack of confidence in educating the masses to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles? As Party members and cadres, facing the bourgeois liberalization trend that aims to overthrow the Party's leadership and the socialist system, how can one remain indifferent? If we allow those who should uphold the constitution to "confidently" oppose the constitution, and allow those who should act according to the Party Constitution to "confidently" oppose the Party, that would be a gross dereliction of duty.

Strengthening ideological education and clarifying right from wrong is not only a need of the Party but also a need of the state and the people. During this turmoil and riot, most of those with wrong ideas did not truly understand the situation. To say that they wanted to overthrow the Party's leadership and the socialist system, they probably never even thought about it. Some employees of WISCO were also once confused by the swirling rumors, but when the Party Committee clarified the counter-revolutionary nature of the turmoil, these employees immediately stood up to oppose it. The facts have proven that confidently carrying out ideological education will gain the support of the broad masses.

The Party Committee of WISCO has always valued ideological education, and this has shown clear results in this anti-turmoil effort. Some of their methods may not be applicable to other places, but their basic experience is completely learnable and should be learned, which is to confidently carry out ideological education.

    理直气壮地抓思想教育
    本报评论员
    武钢党委在黑云压城的动乱之中，理直气壮地教育职工拥护党和社会主义，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱。14万职工坚定地拥护党中央的决策，坚守生产岗位，粉碎了极少数坏人“搞乱武钢，搞乱武汉，震动全国”的阴谋。这不仅又一次证明我国产业工人是党所依赖的中坚力量，而且再一次说明思想政治工作确实是党的生命线。
    教育全国人民坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，做有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人，本来就是新时期思想政治工作的题中之义。但是，近年来由于有些地方放松了思想政治工作，致使资产阶级自由化日渐泛滥。有些“自我意识”强烈到极端的人一听“思想教育”就恼火，说：“你教育谁？你懂什么？”一些“精英”更是用舶来的“民主”“自由”“人权”蛊惑群众，使人感到“受教育”是一种耻辱，是对“个人意志”和“智慧”的蔑视，从而对思想教育产生厌恶和抵触情绪。在这样的“气候”下，有些党组织对抓思想教育不那么理直气壮，对反对资产阶级自由化缺乏自觉性。于是，在庄严的共产党的讲坛上和高雅的科学殿堂里，居然一度出现马列主义受冷落，资产阶级自由化的奇谈怪论受欢迎的奇怪现象，这难道不值得深思吗？
    这次北京发生动乱和暴乱中，一些不明真相的群众之所以产生一些糊涂思想，甚至同情一些错误的行为，从根本上说，是与前一段放松思想教育的失误有关。这个教训非常惨痛。曾经对抓思想教育感到不那么理直气壮的同志，认真反思一下，是不是会有经梦之感？在共产党执政的中国教育群众拥护党的领导；在社会主义制度已经牢固确立的中国教育群众坚持走社会主义道路，这是理所当然的事情。中国人民所以肯跟着共产党走，吃了那么多的苦，流了那么多的血，就是为了实现这个愿望。怎么在社会主义制度取得巨大成就，特别是党的改革开放政策使人民生活已经得到明显提高的情况下，反而对教育群众坚持四项基本原则感到理不直气不壮了呢？作为党员和干部，面对旨在推翻党的领导和社会主义制度的资产阶级自由化思潮，怎么能见怪不怪呢？如果听任那些应该遵守宪法的人在那里“理直气壮”地反对宪法，听任那些应该按党章行事的党员“理直气壮”地反对党，那就是最大的失职。
    加强思想教育，明辨大是大非，不仅是党的需要，也是国家的需要，人民的需要。这次暴乱和动乱中，有错误认识的人，多数是因为不明真相，要说推翻党的领导和社会主义制度，他们恐怕想都没有想过。武钢的一些职工在纷纷扬扬的谣言中也曾经陷入过迷惘，但是，当党委把动乱的反革命实质一讲清，这些职工就毫不犹豫地站出来反对动乱。事实证明，理直气壮地抓思想教育，会得到广大群众的支持。
    武钢党委平时重视思想教育，在这次反动乱中见到了明显成效。他们的一些做法，其他地方未必能照搬，但他们的基本经验是完全可以学而且应该学的，这就是，理直气壮地抓思想教育。
