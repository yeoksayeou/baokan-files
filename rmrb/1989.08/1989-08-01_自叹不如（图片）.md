In the realm of art, there are countless works that have left a profound impact on people's hearts. Among them, the works of the great masters are particularly noteworthy. These masters, through their unique perspectives and profound insights, have created works that transcend time and space, resonating deeply with audiences across generations.

However, as an artist, I often find myself in a state of self-deprecation. When I compare my works to those of the great masters, I feel a sense of inadequacy. Their creations are like shining stars in the night sky, illuminating the path for countless aspiring artists. In contrast, my works seem like faint glimmers, barely visible in the vast expanse of artistic creation.

Yet, I do not despair. Instead, I use this sense of self-deprecation as a driving force to push myself further. I believe that every artist has their own unique journey and style. While I may not reach the heights of the great masters, I can still strive to create works that reflect my own understanding and emotions.

In the process of creation, I often reflect on the words of the great masters. Their wisdom and insights provide me with invaluable guidance. I learn from their techniques, their use of color, their composition, and their ability to convey deep emotions through simple forms.

But more than just technical skills, I am inspired by their passion and dedication. The great masters did not create for fame or fortune; they created because they had something to say, something to express. This pure and unadulterated love for art is what truly sets them apart.

As I continue on my artistic journey, I carry with me this sense of self-deprecation. It reminds me of the vastness of the artistic world and the endless possibilities it holds. It pushes me to explore new techniques, to experiment with different styles, and to never stop learning.

In the end, perhaps the true measure of an artist is not how their works compare to those of the great masters, but how they have grown and evolved over time. Each work is a testament to the artist's journey, a snapshot of their thoughts and emotions at a particular moment.

So, I continue to create, to learn, and to grow. And though I may often find myself in a state of self-deprecation, I know that this is a necessary part of the artistic process. It is through this constant self-reflection and self-improvement that I can hope to create works that, in their own way, resonate with others.
