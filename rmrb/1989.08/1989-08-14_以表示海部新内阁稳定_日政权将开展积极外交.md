Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 14th.

According to reports from local newspapers today, the newly formed cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will soon embark on active diplomatic activities to demonstrate its stability both domestically and internationally.

Scheduled diplomatic activities include: from late August to early September, Foreign Minister Taro Nakamura will travel to Paris to attend the international conference on the Cambodian issue, followed by visits to Eastern and Central Europe.

On September 4th, Japan and the Soviet Union will hold vice-ministerial consultations in Moscow. At the same time, consultations on economic issues between Japan and the United States will be held in Tokyo.

From September 5th to 10th, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will visit the United States.

Around September 20th, the British Prime Minister and the U.S. Vice President will successively visit Japan.

In late September, Foreign Minister Nakamura will travel to New York to participate in the United Nations General Assembly.

After taking office, Miyazawa immediately expressed his intention to visit the United States. From the above schedule, it can be seen that the new Japanese government still regards strengthening Japan-U.S. relations as its top diplomatic priority.
