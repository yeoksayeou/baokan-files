A high-tech product, the 20-50KV series high-voltage lead for color televisions, has been successfully developed by the Yantai Cable Factory of the Radiation Technology Company under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The various performance parameters of this product meet or exceed the quality standards of similar foreign products. In early August, it passed a technical appraisal in Beijing, which was attended by experts from the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, as well as the television and electrical cable industries. The newly developed product's main performance indicators, such as voltage resistance, temperature resistance, and flame retardancy, all meet the ministry's standards.
