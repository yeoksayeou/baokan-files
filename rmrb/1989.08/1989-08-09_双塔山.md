On the eastern side of Luan River Town in Chengde City, by the banks of the Luan River, there stand two towering peaks resembling pagodas. These are the Double Pagoda Mountains. They stand side by side, and from a distance, they look like two colossal iron towers reaching for the sky, majestic and awe-inspiring. Up close, they resemble an elderly couple, smiling and chatting affectionately, stirring one's imagination. The mountain consists of two peaks, north and south. The southern peak is about 30 meters high from top to base, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom. Its circumference at the base is about 20 meters. The northern peak is about 40 meters high, even more robust than the southern peak. The two peaks are approximately seven to eight meters apart.

Strangely, each peak has a small temple-like structure on top, resembling brick pagodas. However, no one knows exactly when, by whom, or for what purpose these structures were built. What lies inside them remains a mystery. Ji Xianlin recorded in "Yuewei Caotang Notes": "There are two pagoda peaks standing tall and straight, looking like two floating stupas rising from the ground, with no path to climb. Sometimes at night, one can hear the sound of bells, chants, and sutras from above, and during the day, clouds occasionally drift around. In the 33rd year of the Qianlong reign (1768), officials were ordered to build wooden ladders and send people to climb and inspect. One peak had a circumference of 106 steps, with a small house inside containing a table and an incense burner, and a stone tablet inscribed with the words 'Wang Xiansheng'; the other peak had a circumference of 62 steps, with two plots of leeks planted, neatly arranged like a garden, clearly not the work of human hands."

Now, with a telescope, one can see that the brick pagoda on the northern peak is cone-shaped, less than three meters high, with no door. The brick pagoda on the southern peak faces south, is square-shaped, about 2.5 meters on each side, and 5.2 meters high in total. The door is 1.5 meters high and about 1 meter wide. The base is built directly on the rock at the top of the peak using several layers of bricks. The four corners have wooden eaves protruding, with wind chimes hanging from them. The east, south, and west walls are made of green bricks with mortar. Judging from the bricks and tiles that have fallen from the pagoda, it is a tomb pagoda from the Liao Dynasty.

It is said that over a thousand years ago, there was a natural stone wall about 200 to 300 meters long at the top of the mountain. During the Liao Dynasty, the route from Gubeikou to Chengde was an important transportation line between the northern frontier and the central plains. The area along the route had a relatively high population density and developed production. After the death of noble leaders, tomb pagodas were built at the wider ends of the stone wall to signify their high status and respect. At that time, people could walk along the natural stone wall to the top of the pagoda for worship. Later, due to thousands of years of wind and rain erosion and natural weathering, the stone wall gradually crumbled and disappeared, leaving behind these two solitary peaks resembling stone pillars.

    双塔山
    刘兰松
    承德市滦河镇东侧的滦水之畔，有两座突兀的塔形山峰，这就是双塔山。它们并肩而立，远看如两座擎天铁塔，巍峨壮观；近瞅，如一对老年夫妇，相亲相爱地在笑吟吟叙谈，颇引人遐思。此山分南北两峰，南峰从顶部至根部高约30余米，上粗下细。其根部周长约20多米。北峰高约40米，比南峰更粗壮。两峰相距约七八米。
    奇怪的是，两座峰顶上各有一座小庙式的建筑，类似砖塔。但它究竟是何年何月何人修建的？里边到底有什么东西？这一直是个谜。纪晓岚在《阅微草堂笔记》中记载：“有双塔峰，亭亭对立，远望如两浮图，拔地涌出，无路可上。或夜闻上有钟磬经呗声，昼亦时有片云往来。乾隆庚戌，命弁吏构木为梯，遣人登视，一峰周围一百零六步，上有小屋，屋中一几一香炉，中供片石镌王仙生三字；一峰周围六十二步，上种韭二畦，塍畛方正，如园圃之所筑，是决非人力之所到。”现在用望远镜眺望，可见北峰上砖塔成锥形，高不过三米，无门；南峰砖塔坐北朝南，呈方形，边长二米余，通高5.2米，门高1.5米，宽1米余。基础是用几层砖直接砌在峰顶岩石上的，四角有木檐探出，上挂风铃，东西南三墙壁是青砖压缝砌成。据从塔上落下来的砖瓦片考查，是辽代的墓塔。
    据传在一千多年前，山顶部有一道二三百米长的天然石墙。辽代时期，古北口至承德是塞北地区与中原地区交往的重要交通线路。沿线人口分布较多，生产也较发达。贵族首领死后，便在石墙端部的较宽处修建了塔墓，以示崇高和敬仰。那时，人们可从天然石墙上走到塔顶去祭祀。后来，由于千百年来的风雨侵蚀和自然风化，石墙逐渐断裂消失了，便留下了如今这两座石笋般的孤山。
