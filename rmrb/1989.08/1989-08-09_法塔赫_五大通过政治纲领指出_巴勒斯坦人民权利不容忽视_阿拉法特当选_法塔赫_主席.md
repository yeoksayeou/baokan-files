Fatah's Fifth Congress Adopts Political Program, Emphasizes Palestinian Rights, Arafat Elected Chairman

TUNIS, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- The fifth congress of Fatah, the main Palestinian guerrilla organization, concluded its six-day meeting today after adopting a political program.

The political program states in its preamble that the Palestinian people are a concrete reality that cannot be ignored. It asserts that peace, stability, and security in the Middle East cannot be achieved without recognizing the independence and self-determination of the Palestinian people.

The document calls on the United States to acknowledge the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and urges Washington to agree to convene a Middle East conference as soon as possible.

The document rejects the election plan proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Shamir and decides to continue strengthening military actions and various forms of struggle to end Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.

The document also designates the political program as the future action guideline.

TUNIS, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- According to the Palestine News Agency, Palestinian President Arafat was elected chairman of the central committee of Fatah at the fifth congress of the organization today.

The new central committee of Fatah will have its members increased from 15 to 21. Arafat's responsibility is to preside over the meetings of the committee and supervise its activities.

Fatah is the main guerrilla organization of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Since its establishment, Arafat has been a member of the central committee. This is the first time he has been elected as chairman.
