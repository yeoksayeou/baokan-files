The Wa Fang Dian Bearing Factory in Liaoning Province is a large backbone enterprise in the national bearing industry, with over 23,000 employees, including 3,000 party members. In the past few years, the factory party committee has faced the trend of bourgeois liberalization, the weakening of the party's role amidst calls for strengthening it, and the dispersion of the enterprise's political work team despite calls for reinforcement. They have not spoken or acted against their conscience. Instead, they have adhered to the party's principle of seeking truth from facts and have combined this with the specific situation of the factory. They have vigorously supported the factory director's responsibility system while striving to play the role of the party committee, effectively promoting the construction of "two civilizations" in the enterprise.

Starting from the nature and status of the party, the factory party committee has insisted on playing the political leadership role of the party committee. After the enterprise implemented the factory director's responsibility system, the position and role of the party committee changed. This is a reform of the party's leadership system, leadership methods, and work methods in the new era. However, due to the influence of some erroneous public opinions, some people have misunderstood this reform as a change in the party's leadership role and core role, leading to phenomena such as the fading of the party's image, the denigration of the party's role, and the weakening of the party's leadership. Facing these phenomena, the factory party committee firmly believes that the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and the core leadership of the socialist cause. This is clearly stipulated in the Constitution and the Party Constitution and cannot be changed. They also believe that the nature and status of the party must be reflected through the role of the grassroots organizations. Neglecting, weakening, or denying the role of grassroots organizations will cause the party to "break the chain" and lose its solid foundation. Based on this, they have worked hard in their actual work to eliminate interference and negative influences, consciously playing the political leadership role of the party committee. The methods include: organizing, coordinating, researching, and deploying the work of the party, government, trade union, and propaganda departments; earnestly propagating and implementing the party's line, principles, and policies; striving to turn the party's proposals into the conscious actions of the majority of workers; earnestly organizing various levels of leading cadres and the majority of workers to carry out political theory learning, forming systems, and persevering to continuously improve the political quality of all workers; discussing and deciding on major issues of mass organizations; insisting on joint assessment of cadres by the party and the government, joint research on the appointment and removal of cadres, and regular organization of workers and masses to democratically evaluate various levels of leading cadres; frequently carrying out mass political activities such as political current affairs question and answer competitions and bearing workers singing praises to the party, etc., to activate the political atmosphere in the enterprise; daring to insist on the party's organizational principles. The Wa Fang Dian Bearing Factory once had abnormal phenomena such as the appointment and removal of branch secretaries by sub-factory directors and the dismissal of branch committee members. The party committee firmly stopped and corrected these phenomena. Over the years, due to the factory party committee's concern and demands for party members from a political perspective, they have effectively resisted the trend of bourgeois liberalization. During the turmoil and even the counter-revolutionary rebellion, all party members, cadres, and workers in the factory have maintained a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee, with clear banners and firm positions. They have guarded their posts and worked hard, with no one participating in parades, writing big-character posters, or causing incidents. The production and operation indicators for April, May, June, and July all reached historical best levels, receiving high praise from the higher-level party committee.

Starting from the actual situation of the enterprise, the factory party committee has stabilized the political work team. In recent years, a trend of cutting the political work team has swept through society, with calls to cut structures, reduce personnel, transfer functions, and remove positions, seemingly becoming an inevitable trend. However, the bearing factory party committee, regardless of whether it is the southeast wind or the northwest wind, does not sway or follow the trend. Instead, they start from the actual situation of the enterprise and do what is beneficial.

At the beginning of last year, someone proposed learning from the experience of a certain factory elsewhere to establish a party committee work department, parallel to the administrative departments, with the party committee secretary serving as the department head. When discussing this plan, party committee secretary Gao Zhongqian firmly opposed it. He said that large backbone enterprises should play a backbone role in the national economy and political life. In organizational reforms, they should start from the actual situation and seek truth from facts, not blindly copy and paste. Establishing a party committee work department does not suit the actual situation of the Wa Fang Dian Factory and is not conducive to playing the role of the party committee.

At the beginning of last year, the trend of cutting political work departments and reducing personnel resurfaced, with strong momentum and significant backing. Even newspapers appeared with the bizarre talk of "reducing political work personnel by half and doubling production." At this time, someone again proposed drastically streamlining the political work structure and team. Under these circumstances, the factory party committee remained calm. They believed that reform must start from the actual situation. With the change in the functions of the enterprise party committee, only appropriate adjustments can be made to the political work structure and team, and it is absolutely not possible to "cut to the bone." Through their efforts, the political work structure and team in the entire factory not only did not undergo "massive cuts," but with the deepening of the reform and the need to strengthen party building, under the support of the administrative leadership, they also established a party committee for the headquarters, strengthened the Workers' Thought and Political Work Research Association, established an administrative publicity department, and resumed the factory's "part-time party school" that had been suspended for two years.

In recent years, the factory party committee has insisted on carrying out party work in a model suitable for the factory, unaffected by external interference. For example, someone urged party committee secretary Gao Zhongqian to concurrently serve as deputy factory director, but he decided not to. He believed that the responsibility of the party committee secretary is to grasp party building. Concurrently serving as deputy factory director is not conducive to performing the supervisory functions of the party committee and is not conducive to concentrating on party building. To strengthen party building, the factory party committee also established full-time secretaries and union chairpersons in 43 sub-factories and departments with many workers, treating them equally with administrative cadres in terms of benefits. This strengthened the organizational construction of grassroots party organizations.

Because they have always insisted on seeking truth from facts and being practical, they have retained political work backbones, stabilized the political work team, ensured the normal operation of the party committee's work, and created a prerequisite for strengthening the enterprise's thought political work and spiritual civilization construction.

Starting from the party's fine traditions, the factory party committee has persistently carried out thought political work and spiritual civilization construction. After the enterprise implemented the factory director's responsibility system, some enterprise party committees have neglected thought political work. The Wa Fang Dian Factory party committee believes that thought political work is a fine tradition of the party and must not be abandoned at any time. No matter who is in charge, someone must do it. The enterprise party committee's grasp of thought political work is a matter of course. Especially in the process of transferring the leadership of thought political work and establishing a new pattern, to avoid the appearance of a "gap," the party committee must still bear the leadership responsibility for thought political work. Guided by this idea, they actively straightened out thoughts, functions, structures, and work, establishing a new pattern of thought political work suitable for the factory. That is: the factory director is fully responsible, the party committee takes charge, and the party, government, trade union, and propaganda departments cooperate in division of labor, with party and government cadres jointly managing. They truly achieved "division of responsibilities but unity of thought; division of work but unity of goals; division of systems but unity of relationships."

In recent years, the Wa Fang Dian Factory party committee has closely combined the doubts, hotspots in the workers' thoughts, and difficulties in production and operation, and has carried out thought political work and spiritual civilization construction in a down-to-earth manner.

They have carried out education on "the factory prospers, I am honored; the factory declines, I am ashamed" among the broad masses of workers, carried out education on "knowing, loving, and contributing to the Wa Fang Dian Factory's flight," and carried out enterprise spirit education. Through education, the broad masses of workers have enhanced their sense of being the masters and love for the factory. In four years, the broad masses of workers have raised 889.2 million yuan for the enterprise, effectively easing the enterprise's financial difficulties; they have proposed 98,600 rationalization suggestions, which have had a huge impact on improving the enterprise's economic benefits; scientific and technological personnel have completed 774 scientific and technological projects in the "speak of ideals, compare contributions" activity, strengthening the pace of the enterprise's technological transformation and technological innovation. Practice has once again proven that political work is the lifeline of all economic work.

    不管东西南北风  党的领导不放松
    ——瓦房店轴承厂党委加强思想政治工作
    柳堡
    辽宁省瓦房店轴承厂是全国轴承行业的大型骨干企业，现有职工2.3万多名，其中党员3000名。在过去的几年里，厂党委面对资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥、党的作用在加强声中削弱、企业政工队伍在强化声中涣散的不正常“气候”，不说违心话，不干违心事，结合本厂的具体情况，坚持党的一切从实际出发，实事求是的思想路线，既大力支持厂长负责制，又努力发挥党委自身作用，有力地推动了企业的“双文明”建设。
    从党的性质和地位出发，坚持发挥党委的政治领导作用
    企业实行厂长负责制以后，党委的地位和作用发生了变化。这本来是新时期党的领导制度、领导方法和工作方法的改革。但是，由于一些错误舆论的影响，一些人把这种改革理解为党的领导作用、核心作用的改变，进而出现了淡化党的形象、诋毁党的作用、削弱党的领导等现象。面对这些现象，厂党委坚信，中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，是社会主义事业的领导核心，这是宪法和党章都明确规定了的，是不能改变的。同时认为，党的性质和地位要通过基层组织的作用去体现，忽视、削弱、否定基层组织的作用，党就会“断层”，失去牢固的基础。据此，他们在实际工作中努力排除干扰和不良影响，自觉发挥党委的政治领导作用。途径是：组织、协调、研究、布置党政工团宣传部门的工作，认真宣传贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，努力使党的主张变成广大职工的自觉行动；认真组织各级领导班子，各级干部和广大职工开展政治理论学习，形成制度，坚持不懈，不断提高全体职工的政治素质；讨论决定群众组织的重大事项，坚持与行政共同考核干部，共同研究任免干部，定期组织职工群众民主讲评各级领导干部；经常开展群众性的政治活动，如政治时事答题竞赛、轴承工人歌颂党等等，活跃企业中的政治气氛；勇于坚持党的组织原则。瓦房店轴承厂曾发生过分厂长任免党总支书记，罢免党总支委员等不正常现象，党委对此进行了坚决的制止和纠正。几年来，由于厂党委从政治上关心党员，要求党员，因而有效地抵制了资产阶级自由化思潮。在动乱乃至反革命暴乱期间，全厂广大党员、干部、工人始终与党中央保持高度一致，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，坚守岗位，努力工作，没有一人参加游行，没写一张大小字报，没发生一起案件，四五六三个月的生产经营指标都创历史最好水平，受到上级党委的高度赞扬。
    从企业实际出发，稳定政工队伍
    这几年，社会上刮起了砍政工队伍风，机构要砍，人员要简，职能要转，职务要免，这似乎成了必然趋势。但是，轴承厂党委“不管是东南风还是西北风”，都不随风倒、跟着跑，而是从企业实际出发，怎么有利怎么干。
    前年初，有人提出要学习外地某厂经验，成立党委工作部，与行政各部门平行，由党委书记任部长。讨论这一方案时，党委书记高忠谦坚决反对。他说，大型骨干企业在国家经济生活和政治生活中都要发挥骨干作用，在机构改革中，要从实际出发，实事求是，不能照搬乱套，成立党委工作部，不符合瓦轴厂的实际情况，不利于发挥党委的作用。
    去年初，企业政工部门砍机构，减人员之风又起，风势猛，来头大，报刊上甚至出现“政工人员减一半，生产翻一番”的奇谈怪论。这时有人又提出大刀阔斧地精简政工机构和队伍。在这种情况下，厂党委头脑冷静，他们认为，改革必须从实际出发，随着企业党委职能的转变，只能对政工机构和队伍进行适当的调整，决不能“伤筋动骨”。经他们努力争取，全厂政工机构和队伍非但没有进行“大杀大砍”，反而随着改革的深入，根据加强党的建设的需要，在行政领导的支持下，又设立了机关党委，强化了职工思想政治工作研究会，成立了行政宣传处，恢复了停了两年时间的厂“业余党校”。
    这几年，厂党委坚持按照适合本厂情况的模式开展党的工作，不受外界的干扰，例如：有人动员党委书记高忠谦同志兼任副厂长，他拿定主意不兼任。他认为，党委书记的职责是抓党的建设，兼任副厂长，不利于履行党委的监督职能，也不利于集中精力抓党的建设。为了加强党的建设，厂党委还在职工较多的43个分厂，处室设专职书记和工会主席，在待遇上与行政干部一视同仁。从而加强了基层党组织的组织建设。
    由于他们始终坚持从实际出发，实事求是，因而保留了政工骨干，稳定了政工队伍，保证了党委工作的正常进行，为加强企业思想政治工作和精神文明建设创造了先决条件。
    从党的优良传统出发，持之以恒地开展思想政治工作和精神文明建设
    企业实行厂长负责制以后，有一些企业党委对思想政治工作撒手不管。瓦轴厂党委认为，思想政治工作是党的优良传统，任何时候都不能丢，不论谁负责，总要有人干，企业党委抓思想政治工作天经地义。特别是在思想政治工作领导权转换、建立新格局的过程中，为避免出现“空档”，党委仍然要对思想政治工作负领导责任。本着这样的指导思想，他们积极理顺思想、职能、机构和工作，建立了适合本厂特点的思想政治工作新格局。即：厂长全面负责，党委管起来，党政工团分工合作，党政干部齐抓共管。真正做到了“职责上分，思想上合；工作上分，目标上合；制度上分，关系上合”。
    几年来，瓦轴厂党委紧密结合职工思想上的疑点、热点和生产经营中的难点，扎扎实实地开展思想政治工作和精神文明建设。
    他们针对企业资金不足，材料短缺、涨价，能源紧张等一系列困难，在广大职工中开展了“厂兴我荣、厂衰我耻”教育，开展了“知瓦轴、爱瓦轴、为瓦轴腾飞做贡献”教育，开展了企业精神教育。通过教育，使广大职工增强了主人公意识和爱厂精神。四年中，广大职工为企业集资889.2万元，有效地缓解了企业资金不足的困难；提合理化建议98600多条，对提高企业经济效益产生了巨大作用；科技人员在“讲理想、比贡献”活动中完成774个科技项目，加强了企业技术改造和技术革新的步伐。实践再次证明，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。
