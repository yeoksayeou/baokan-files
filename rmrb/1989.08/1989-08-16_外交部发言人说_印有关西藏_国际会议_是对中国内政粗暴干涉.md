	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Says Indian Conference on Tibet is a Gross Interference in China's Internal Affairs
	Beijing, August 16 (Xinhua) — The spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said today in response to a reporter's question that recently, some Indian political figures held and presided over an international conference on the issue of "Tibet and Peace in South Asia" in New Delhi. This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and has seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and is also not conducive to the further improvement of Sino-Indian relations.

	The spokesperson made these remarks when asked by a reporter for his comments on the recent international conference held in New Delhi, the capital of India.

	The spokesperson said: "We have noted that Indian government officials and leaders of the ruling party and other political parties have repeatedly stated that since Tibet is an autonomous region of China, holding such a conference is inappropriate. However, the Indian government has not been able to effectively stop the holding of this conference, and we express our regret over this."

	He pointed out that it is well known that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and Tibetan affairs are purely China's internal affairs.

    外交部发言人说
    印有关西藏“国际会议”是对中国内政粗暴干涉
    本报北京8月16日讯　中国外交部发言人今天在这里回答记者提问时说，前不久，某些印度政界人士在新德里召开并主持了一个所谓“西藏与南亚和平”问题的“国际会议”，这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，严重地伤害了中国人民的民族感情，也不利于中印关系的进一步改善。
    发言人是在有记者问及他对最近在印度首都新德里召开的这个“国际会议”有何评论时说这番话的。
    发言人说：“我们注意到，印度政府官员和执政党及其他一些政党负责人多次重申，鉴于西藏是中国的一个自治区，召开这样的会议是不合适的。但是印度政府未能有效地制止这个会议的召开，对此，我们表示遗憾。”
    他指出，众所周知，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏事务纯属中国内政。
