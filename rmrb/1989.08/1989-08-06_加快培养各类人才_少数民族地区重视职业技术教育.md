According to statistics from the Education Department of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, there are currently over 5,000 vocational and technical schools in China's minority regions, with 150,000 students enrolled. Many young men and women from rural, pastoral, and mountainous areas have, through study and training, become skilled practitioners in various fields, significantly promoting the development of production and construction in ethnic regions.

In recent years, vocational and technical education has flourished in the five autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Ningxia, and Tibet, as well as in the minority-populated areas of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, and Hainan provinces. Thousands of minority youths have entered various vocational and technical schools and secondary specialized schools to learn different skills. Some ethnic regions, due to the rapid development of vocational and technical education, have cultivated various talents, promoting the economic development of ethnic regions.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established nearly 200 vocational and technical schools. In just three years, Ekenqi League has set up 17 schools, including 10 vocational and technical high schools, 4 vocational and technical middle schools, 2 vocational classes attached to regular high schools, and 1 private vocational and technical school. The schools offer 7 majors, including animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, forestry, horticulture, and agriculture, with a total of 6,233 students. Graduates from these schools have contributed to the development of livestock, agriculture, and forestry in the entire league.

Hubei Province has established over 220 vocational and technical schools. Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hubei and Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan have become key areas for establishing ethnic vocational and technical education in the country. These two prefectures, from the prefecture level down to counties, townships, and villages, have seen various vocational and technical schools flourishing, forming a network for training rural practical technical talents.
