Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 5th.

The Central Propaganda Department's Press Bureau recently organized a symposium with some news workers in the capital. The symposium closely linked news work with actual practice, analyzed, and criticized bourgeois news views. The attendees unanimously agreed that it is an extremely important task to firmly uphold Marxist news views and resolutely oppose the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization in the news front, to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and do a good job in news work in the future.

The attendees mentioned that bourgeois liberalization in the news field has two prominent manifestations: one is advocating abstract news freedom, using bourgeois news freedom to deny the Party's leadership over news work; the other is promoting the idea that "people's interests are above party interests," separating and opposing party interests and people's interests, and denying the pillar of Marxist-Leninist news theory—the principle of party interests.

The attendees said that during this turmoil, one of the important slogans was "fighting for and defending news freedom." In reality, there is no such thing as classless, abstract news freedom. We cannot discuss news freedom without considering the fundamental nature of the socialist system and the socialist news industry. When we talk about news freedom, we must follow the constitution and laws, serve the fundamental interests of the Party and the people, and follow the rules of propaganda. These principles have laid an important foundation for the development of China's news industry. Some attendees mentioned that Western bourgeoisie have always advocated "news freedom," misleading and deceiving many young people. During the turmoil in some parts of China, "Voice of America" manufactured and spread a large number of rumors, repeatedly broadcasting provocative and inflammatory articles, performing to the fullest in the anti-communist and anti-socialist wave, fully exposing the essence of Western bourgeois news freedom.

Some attendees said that from this turmoil, it can be seen that the news freedom advocated by some people is to have the freedom to oppose the central government's major decisions, the freedom to arbitrarily reverse the correct conclusions made by the central government, the freedom to spread rumors, the freedom to slander Party and state leaders, and to incite the overthrow of the legitimate government, etc. If such news freedom is allowed to develop, the country will be in chaos. Some attendees pointed out that when the turmoil planned by a few people was escalating, Zhao Ziyang talked with the then central leader in charge of propaganda work on May 6, not mentioning the guiding role of public opinion and the role of Party newspapers as the mouthpiece, but only emphasizing so-called news freedom, emphasizing that news reports should be opened up, which was supporting and encouraging those who promoted bourgeois liberalization, inciting the news industry to use "news freedom" for wrong public opinion guidance.

The attendees said that some people proposed the so-called "people's interests are above party interests," advocating that newspapers should represent the people to supervise the Party, as if the Party cannot represent the people, only newspapers can represent the people, opposing party interests and people's interests, even wanting to put people's interests above party interests. Some attendees said that Hu Jiewei advocated and insisted on this "theory," repeatedly promoting it, causing serious impacts in the news industry. For a period of time, emphasizing party interests was seen as "rigid," party interests became a tight shackle that needed to be discarded, while the "people's interests" advocated by some people were promoted, attempting to use this to deny the principle of party interests and get rid of the Party's leadership.

Some attendees said that Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee that some people "oppose the Party's leadership in the name of democracy, and make un-Marxist statements on the issue of party interests and people's interests." This clearly revealed the essence of the problem. In our country, the Party's leadership and people's democracy are unified, and the party interests and people's interests in news work are also unified. Opposing the Party's leadership and people's democracy, opposing party interests and people's interests, assuming that people can be separated from the Party, will only lead to a state of anarchy, undermine people's democracy, and give opportunities to conspirators and bad people, seriously harming the socialist cause.

The attendees at the symposium pointed out that the mistakes in public opinion guidance have given the best answer to the so-called "people's interests are above party interests." During the turmoil, some people thought that the Party Central Committee's judgment on the nature of the turmoil was wrong, and the martial law measures were also wrong, so they wanted to reflect the "voices of the people." In fact, they could only reflect the demands of a few turmoil instigators and the extreme emotions of some people who were temporarily unaware of the truth. The process of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot made people deeply realize that the true representatives of the people are the Party Central Committee and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries represented by Deng Xiaoping.

Speakers at the symposium included: Liu Liang, Editor-in-Chief of the PLA Daily (written speech), Lin Yushu, Director of the Education Department of Guangming Daily, Feng Bing, Director of the Commentary Department of Economic Daily, Lu Guo'an, Director of the Editorial Department of Central People's Broadcasting Station, Yu Quanyu, Editor-in-Chief of Economic Reference News, Wang Jun, Deputy Professor of Beijing Broadcasting Institute, and Wang Furu, Director of the Press Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department.

Li Yan, Deputy Director of the Central Propaganda Department, attended the meeting and spoke.

### 中宣部新闻局召开新闻理论座谈会  坚持马克思主义新闻观点  反对资产阶级自由化思潮

    中宣部新闻局召开新闻理论座谈会
    坚持马克思主义新闻观点  反对资产阶级自由化思潮
    新华社北京8月5日电  中宣部新闻局日前组织首都部分新闻工作者座谈，紧密结合新闻工作实际，分析和批判资产阶级新闻观点。与会同志一致认为，旗帜鲜明地坚持马克思主义的新闻观点，坚决反对资产阶级自由化思潮的侵蚀，是我们新闻战线深入贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，做好今后新闻工作的一项极为重要的任务。
    参加座谈的同志谈到，资产阶级自由化思潮在新闻领域有两个突出的表现，一是宣扬抽象的新闻自由，用资产阶级新闻自由来否定党对新闻工作的领导；二是鼓吹“人民性高于党性”，把党性与人民性割裂开来，对立起来，否定马列主义新闻理论的支柱——党性原则。
    参加座谈的同志说，这次动乱中打出的一个重要旗号是“争取和捍卫新闻自由”。其实，超阶级的、抽象的新闻自由是不存在的。我们不能离开社会主义制度和社会主义新闻事业的根本性质来讲新闻自由。我们讲新闻自由，要遵守宪法和法律，服从党和人民的根本利益，遵守宣传纪律。这些原则，为我国新闻事业的发展奠定了重要基础。有的同志谈到，西方资产阶级一贯标榜“新闻自由”，迷惑和欺骗了不少年轻同志。这次在我国一些地方发生动乱期间，“美国之音”制造和传播了大量谣言，连篇累牍地播出挑拨煽动性文章，在反共反社会主义的浪潮中作了淋漓尽致的表演，充分暴露了西方资产阶级新闻自由的本质。
    有些同志说，从这次动乱可以看出，某些人所提倡的新闻自由，就是要有反对中央重大决策的自由，有对中央已经作出的正确结论任意翻案的自由，有传播谣言的自由，有肆意辱骂党和国家领导人、煽动推翻合法政府的自由，等等。如果听任这种新闻自由发展，就会国无宁日。有的同志指出，在极少数人策划的动乱不断升级的时候，赵紫阳同志5月6日同当时中央主管宣传工作的领导人谈话，只字不提新闻工作的舆论导向和党报的喉舌作用，只强调所谓新闻自由，强调新闻报道要放开，就是给那些搞资产阶级自由化的人撑腰打气，煽动新闻界利用“新闻自由”进行错误的舆论导向。
    与会同志说，有人提出了所谓“人民性高于党性”，主张要由报纸代表人民来监督党，似乎党不能代表人民，只有报纸才能代表人民，把党性和人民性对立起来，甚至要把人民性凌驾于党性之上。有的同志说，胡绩伟同志提出和坚持这种“理论”，经过反复宣扬，在新闻界造成严重影响。一段时间以来，强调党性被看作“僵化”，党性成了亟待摆脱的紧箍咒，而某些人所标榜的“人民性”受到宣扬，企图以此否定党性原则，摆脱党的领导。
    有的同志说，邓小平同志在十二届二中全会讲话中曾经指出，有的人“把民主同党的领导对立起来，在党性和人民性的问题上提出违反马克思主义的说法”。这就把问题的实质清楚地揭示了出来。在我国，党的领导与人民民主是统一的，新闻工作的党性与人民性也是统一的。把党的领导和人民民主对立起来，把党性和人民性对立起来，以为人民可以离开党，结果只能造成无政府状态，破坏人民民主，就会给阴谋家和坏人以可乘之隙，严重损害社会主义事业。
    参加座谈会的同志指出，这次舆论导向的错误，对所谓“人民性高于党性”作了最好的回答。动乱期间，有些人认为党中央对动乱性质判断错了，戒严的措施也是错误的，因而他们要反映“人民的声音”。其实他们反映的只能是极少数动乱制造者的要求和一时不明真相的群众的偏激情绪。平息反革命暴乱的过程，使人们深深体会到，真正代表人民的是党中央和以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家。
    在座谈会上发言的有：解放军报社社长吕梁（书面发言）、光明日报学校教育部主任林玉树、经济日报评论部主任冯并、中央人民广播电台总编室主任栗国安、《经济参考》报总编辑喻权域、北京广播学院副教授王珏和中宣部新闻局局长王福如。
    中宣部副部长李彦同志到会并讲了话。
