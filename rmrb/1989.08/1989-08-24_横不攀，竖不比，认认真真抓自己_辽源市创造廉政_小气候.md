A deputy township head built a house, reporting to the county for approval before it was completed, but started construction on a 111.3 square meter house without waiting for the approval. The house exceeded the approved area by more than 30 square meters. The new house was not occupied and was ordered to be vacated. The party issued a warning and publicly criticized the incident throughout the county.

This incident occurred in Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province.

Starting from the Leadership

To address the issue of officials' housing, which has drawn significant public criticism, and to curb the trend of using housing for personal gain and excessive housing allocation, in 1987, Liaoyuan City established a "Housing Cleanup Leadership Group." The group mobilized over 1,190 officials to conduct a comprehensive inspection of all 47,048 public housing units and subsidized sales houses in the city. During this inspection, 1,914 housing units with various issues were identified, including 309 cases of disciplinary problems. The Municipal Party Committee convened a special meeting to publicly address these issues, which had a significant impact across the city.

The former director and party secretary of the Municipal Housing Bureau had made significant contributions during his tenure. However, he used his authority to arrange for a larger-than-approved new house and had his subordinates fund the over-standard renovation. After the issue was exposed, he attempted to cover up his mistakes. With the support of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, the relevant departments took serious action against him, issuing a severe warning within the party, removing him from his positions as director and party secretary, and having him personally pay for the over-standard renovation costs. The house was confiscated.

From 1985 to the first half of this year, Liaoyuan City has handled 902 cases of disciplinary violations by party members and officials, including 24 cases involving officials at the deputy county level and above.

A comrade from the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission told us that implementing clean governance policies is crucial for leading officials.

Strengthening Constraints and Supervision Measures

In recent years, while handling cases of disciplinary and legal violations, the Liaoyuan Municipal Party Committee has insisted on addressing each issue with corresponding regulations. However, some regulations, despite multiple revisions, still have problems, and bold individuals continue to ignore them.

What is the reason? The Liaoyuan Municipal Party Committee believes there are three main issues: first, the process of formulating regulations lacks transparency, with only a few people aware, lacking a grassroots foundation; second, the regulations themselves are incomplete, focusing only on what should be done and what must be done, while neglecting what happens if they are not followed; third, after the regulations are issued, there is a lack of timely inspections and handling, providing opportunities for those who do not comply.

This year, the three new city-wide regulations on housing issues, prohibiting the use of public funds for extravagant banquets, and others, were formulated with input from officials in all 104 county-level party and government agencies across the city. Opinions from various parties were solicited, and everyone was encouraged to contribute ideas. Additionally, penalties for non-compliance with the regulations were added, achieving good results.

The issue of leading officials using cars for commuting, which was once prevalent, is clearly addressed in the "Regulations on the Management and Use of Small Cars in Party and Government Agencies" formulated this year. It specifies the job levels, age, health conditions, and commuting distances of officials who are eligible to use cars. It also stipulates that those who meet these conditions must apply personally, undergo democratic evaluation by colleagues, receive approval from the leadership team, and finally report to the party and labor committee of the agency, with the decision publicly announced within the unit. This way, everyone can clearly see who is eligible to use a car and who is not. In Dongfeng County, all levels of leading officials commute by bicycle, with no one requesting car pickups. Sometimes, after returning from a trip in a car, they would first go to the office and then ride a bicycle home. In Dongfeng County, it has become a norm that having a car stop at your doorstep is not something to boast about.

Internal constraints, external transparency. In some "window" departments, the excuse of "confidentiality" was often used to retain "privileges." Now, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government require that all matters prone to power-for-money exchanges, urgent public concerns, and suspicious activities be made public as much as possible. Last September, with the approval of the Provincial Government, the Municipal Personnel Bureau recruited 161 people from society for the departments of commerce, taxation, public security, and others. The news was broadcasted through radio, television, and propaganda columns, not only publicizing the number of recruits and specific conditions but also announcing that applications would be unified, examinations would be unified, results would be posted, and the best candidates would be selected, with public supervision welcome. As a result, the entire recruitment and allocation process had no one seeking connections, and there were no complaints afterward.

Changing Work Styles, Improving Credibility

Implementing clean governance policies has promoted changes in party discipline, social ethics, and officials' work styles. Dongliao County has a village called Kuailè in Yanping Township, which, despite its name, is the most remote and impoverished village in the county. Local farmers had not seen county officials visit for over a decade. The village of 826 people had an average debt of 126 yuan per person. This spring, County Party Secretary Lin Yuan led 12 officials to the village for a work assignment, living and eating with the farmers, and studying measures to alleviate poverty together. The county provided some funds, helped the village open 500 mu of new paddy fields, planted over 5,000 new fruit trees, and built a 32-meter-long bridge across the river, ending the villagers' difficulty in leaving the village during the flood season.

The saying "husband and wife department, father and son bureau, son drives the car, father rides" was once a joke in Dongfeng County, but it also reflected the public's dissatisfaction. Currently, all 25 officials at the deputy bureau level and above in the county have implemented a family member avoidance system, proactively transferring their children and relatives out of their units. In the first half of this year, 45 officials in this county were reassigned, all within three days, with no one accepting banquets or gifts.

A responsible comrade from the Liaoyuan Municipal Party Committee told the reporter that clean governance is different when it is enforced and when it is not. Liaoyuan has taken it seriously and has received public welcome and support, achieving good results, but it does not mean that all problems have been solved. He said that so far, some comrades still believe that in the current environment of rectification and order, "whoever practices clean governance first will suffer a loss." Some units have to adopt a "dual-track operation" method, "strictly controlling internally and relaxing externally." The Municipal Party Committee is clear on this point, advocating for "not comparing horizontally, not comparing vertically, and seriously grasping oneself." It is necessary to be genuine and practical, striving to create a small atmosphere of clean governance in Liaoyuan. The Municipal Party Committee also proposed to gradually extend the good practices and experiences of implementing clean governance policies in party and government agencies to enterprises and institutions.

    “横不攀，竖不比，认认真真抓自己”
    ——辽源市创造廉政“小气候”
    本报记者　李安达　徐如俊
    一位副乡长家建房，申报送到县里没等批下来，就擅自动手建起了一座111.3平米的住房，比应审批面积超出了30多平米。新房建成没有住上，被责令退出，党内受到警告处分，并在全县通报批评。
    这件事发生在吉林省辽源市。
    从领导干部做起
    为解决群众意见较大的干部住房问题，刹住以房谋私、多占住房的歪风，1987年，辽源市成立了“清房领导小组”，抽调了1190多名干部，对全市47048户公房和补贴出售的房屋进行了全面清查。在这次清查中，共查出有各类问题的房屋1914户，其中构成违纪问题的309户。市委专门召开会议，进行公开处理，在全市引起了很大震动。
    市房产局原局长兼党委书记，在工作中曾做过不少贡献。但他利用职权，为自己安排超面积新房，并要下属单位出资为其超标准装修。问题被揭露以后，他四处进行活动，试图掩盖错误。在市委、市政府的支持下，有关部门不手软，对他进行严肃处理，党内给予严重警告处分，免去局长、党委书记职务，超标准装修费用由个人支付，房屋被没收。
    从1985年到今年上半年，辽源市已查处各类党员干部违纪案件902起，其中查处副县级以上党员干部24名。
    市纪委的同志对我们说，推行廉政制度，关键在于领导干部。
    加强制约监督措施
    近几年，辽源市委在查处违纪违法案件的同时，坚持每纠正一股歪风，就相应制定一项制度。然而，有些制度虽然多次修订，但问题照样出，胆大的人照样视若无睹。
    原因何在？辽源市委认为主要有三个方面：一是制度的制定过程公开程度不够，只有少数人知道，缺乏群众基础；二是制度本身不健全，只讲应该怎么办，必须怎么办，忽视了不执行怎么办；三是制度颁布之后，检查处理工作不及时，给不执行者留了空子，提供了机会。
    今年年初，辽源市新制定的关于住房问题、严禁用公款大吃大喝等三项全市性制度，每项制度形成之前都在全市104个县级党政机关组织干部讨论，征求各方面人士意见，让大家出主意，同时还增加了不执行制度的处罚条款，收到良好效果。
    曾经风行一时的领导干部坐车上下班问题，在今年制定的《党政机关小汽车管理使用的规定》中，明确了可以坐车的干部职级、年龄、身体状况和上下班路程等，并规定具备这些条件的人坐车，必须本人申请，经职工民主评议，领导班子批准，最后报机关党工委，在本单位公布。这样一来，谁可以乘车，谁不够条件，大家都可以看得清清楚楚。东丰县各级领导干部上下班全部骑自行车，无一人要汽车接送。有时坐车下乡回来晚了，也是先到机关，然后骑自行车回家。在东丰县已经形成一种风气，小车开到家门口，不是什么可以炫耀的事了。
    内部制约，外部公开。过去在一些“窗口”部门，常常以“保密”来保留“特权”，现在市委、市政府要求凡是容易产生权钱交易的事、群众着急的事、犯猜疑的事，都要尽量公开。去年9月，经省政府批准，市人事局为工商、税务、公安等部门从社会上招干161人。消息是通过广播、电视和宣传栏传出的，不仅公开了招干的人数、具体的条件，还告示大家：统一报名，统一考试，张榜公布，择优录取，欢迎群众监督。结果整个录取、分配过程，没有一个找关系的，事后也没有一个上访的。
    转变作风，提高信誉
    推行廉政制度，促进了党风、社会风气和干部作风的转变。东辽县有个宴平乡快乐村，名为“快乐”，实则是全县最偏僻最贫困的村子，当地农民已经10多年见不到县里干部去那里了。全村826口人，人均负债126元。今年春天，县委书记林源带领12名干部到村里蹲点，吃住在农民家里，同农民一起研究落实脱贫措施。县里解决部分资金，帮助村里新开辟水田500亩，新栽果树5000多株，还修了一座长32米的跨河桥，结束了村民汛期难出村的历史。
    “夫妻局，父子科，儿子开车老子坐”在东丰县曾被人们当作笑话传说，实际上也反映了群众的一种不满情绪。目前，全县25名副局以上干部全部实行亲属回避制度，主动把自己的子女亲属调离了本单位。今年上半年，这个县45名干部调动，全部在3天内到位，没有一个接受吃请送礼的。
    辽源市委一位负责同志对记者说，廉政建设抓与不抓不一样，辽源认真抓了，得到了群众的欢迎和支持，收到了好的效果，但不等于把所有的问题都解决了。他说，到目前为止，仍有一部分同志认为，在当前治理整顿的环境下，“谁先廉政谁吃亏”。有些单位不得不采取“双轨运行”的办法，“对内管死，对外放宽”。市委在这一点上态度很明确，叫做“横不攀，竖不比，认认真真抓自己”，要动真的，抓实的，努力创造辽源廉政的“小气候”。市委并且提出，要把党政机关推行廉政制度的好办法好经验，逐步向企事业单位延伸。
