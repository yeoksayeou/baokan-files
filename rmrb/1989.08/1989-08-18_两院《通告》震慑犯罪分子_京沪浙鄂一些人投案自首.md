The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate's "Notice on the Requirement for Criminals Involved in Embezzlement, Bribery, and Speculation to Surrender and Confess Within a Specified Period" has had a significant impact. Within two days of its release, 11 individuals from Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang provinces have surrendered to the procuratorial authorities. Among them, 3 are from Beijing, 3 from Shanghai, and 5 from Zhejiang.

On the evening of the day the notice was released, after watching the Central Television News Broadcast, which aired the notice, Tangxian Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China in Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province, accountant Ying Jiancheng surrendered to the county procuratorial authorities. He confessed to embezzling 446,000 yuan in public funds on two occasions since March of this year. On the day following the release of the notice, August 16th, Shanghai's Putuo District's Zhenru Crane Installation Team accountant Yu Bei (female) brought over 11,000 yuan in illicit funds and surrendered to the procuratorial authorities. On the same day, Zhang Yanzhen, the accountant of Beijing's Hua Mei Decoration Engineering Company, and Li Huaiyun, the manager of the company's "Double Benefit" operating department, surrendered to the Fengtai District procuratorial authorities. They confessed to embezzling over 50,000 yuan in goods funds and also exposed the economic crimes of more than 10 other individuals.

Our reporter in Wuhan reports that the notice has caused a stir in Hubei. On the evening of the 15th, after hearing the notice, Xianning City's Materials Supply Company manager Zhao Jinceng, who had accepted bribes totaling several thousand yuan over the past few years, was unable to sleep all night. The next day, he surrendered to the authorities.

Since this year, Hubei's procuratorial authorities have launched a powerful offensive against economic criminals involved in embezzlement and bribery, achieving significant results. In the first half of the year, nearly 100 economic criminals in Hubei have surrendered, including 26 cases with amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan. So far, 39 criminals in Wuhan have surrendered, returning 236,000 yuan in illicit funds.

Zhang Xiaohong, the deputy manager of Tianmen City's Healthy Village Joint-Venture Oil Factory, embezzled 530,000 yuan in public funds. After seeing the news of the establishment of a reporting center by the city's procuratorial authorities on television, he chose to surrender and confess, seeking leniency. Tu Shaobo, the secretary of the Wuhan Water Transport Company's Party Committee, voluntarily surrendered 140,000 yuan in illegal gains, including bribes. The Jianghan District procuratorial authorities gave him a lenient sentence. It is reported that of the nearly 100 criminals who have surrendered in Hubei Province, 31 have already received lenient treatment.

    两院《通告》震慑犯罪分子  京沪浙鄂一些人投案自首
    据新华社北京8月18日电（记者周立宪）最高人民法院、最高人民检察院《关于贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪分子必须在限期内自首坦白的通告》发布后两天内，北京、上海、浙江3省、市共有11人向检察机关投案自首。其中北京和上海各3名，浙江5名。
    《通告》发布的当天晚上，浙江省永康县农业银行唐先分理处记帐员应健成看了中央电视台新闻联播中播发的两院《通告》后，连夜到县检察院投案自首，交待了自今年3月以来，他两次挪用公款446000元的犯罪事实。上海市普陀区真如起重安装队会计于蓓（女），在《通告》发布的第二天，即8月16日，携带赃款11000多元，到检察机关投案自首。同一天，北京环美装饰工程公司会计张艳仙、该公司“双益”经营部经理李淮云二人到丰台区检察院投案自首，交待了他们私分货款5万余元的犯罪事实，还检举了其他10余人的经济违法犯罪问题。
    本报武汉8月18日电　两院《通告》在湖北引起震动。15日晚，咸宁市生产资料公司经理赵金城听到《通告》后，想起几年来受贿数千元的事，彻夜难眠，第二天就投案自首。
    今年以来，湖北检察机关向贪污受贿等经济犯罪分子发起强大攻势，收效显著。上半年，湖北省已有近百名经济犯罪人员先后投案，其中犯罪金额在万元以上的就有26件。武汉市到目前已有39名犯罪人员自首，退出赃款23.6万元。
