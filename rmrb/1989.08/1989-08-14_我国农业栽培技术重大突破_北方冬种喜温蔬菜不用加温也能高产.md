    China has made a major breakthrough in agricultural facility cultivation technology: In northern regions, heat-loving vegetables such as cucumbers and tomatoes can be successfully grown in winter without heating, using plastic solar greenhouses, and achieve high yields.

    According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang on August 14th, a significant advancement has been made in China's agricultural facility cultivation technology. In winter, northern regions between 34 and 43 degrees north latitude have successfully utilized plastic solar greenhouses to produce heat-loving vegetables like cucumbers and tomatoes, achieving high yields without additional heating.

    A relevant official from the National Agricultural Technology Promotion Station recently introduced that China has successfully conducted comprehensive energy-saving vegetable cultivation experiments in winter across a wide area between 34 and 43 degrees north latitude. In Liaoning's Wafangdian, Haicheng, Jinzhou, and Panshan, Hebei's Yongnian, Shandong's Zibo, Cangshan, and Yantai, optimized greenhouse structures, multi-layer covering, and scientific management have been used to grow heat-loving vegetables like cucumbers and tomatoes in severe winter and early spring without additional heating.

    It is understood that in the past, northern China mainly used coal-fired heating greenhouses for small-scale winter vegetable production. Typically, each acre of heated greenhouse consumes 30-40 tons of coal per winter, with the highest consumption reaching 70 tons, resulting in high production costs. After adopting comprehensive energy-saving technologies, winter production relies solely on solar energy without the need for coal. The yield of heat-loving vegetables produced in plastic solar greenhouses is significantly increased, and the market price of vegetables is noticeably reduced.

### 我国农业栽培技术重大突破  北方冬种喜温蔬菜不用加温也能高产

    我国农业栽培技术重大突破
    北方冬种喜温蔬菜不用加温也能高产
    据新华社沈阳8月14日电　（记者张民华）我国农业设施栽培技术又有一项重大突破：北方地区在冬季不加温的条件下，利用塑料日光温室成功地生产出黄瓜、西红柿等喜温蔬菜，并获得高产。
    全国农业技术推广总站的有关负责人日前介绍，我国已在北纬34—43摄氏度之间的广大地区，冬季利用塑料日光温室成功地进行了蔬菜综合节能栽培试验。辽宁的瓦房店、海城、金州、盘锦，河北的永年，山东的淄博、苍山、烟台等地采用优化棚室结构、多层覆盖、科学管理等综合节能技术，在严冬和早春不加温生产出黄瓜、西红柿等喜温蔬菜。
    据了解，过去我国北方一直采用煤火加温温室进行少量的冬季蔬菜生产。通常每亩加温温室一个冬天耗煤30—40吨，最高的达70吨，生产成本很高。采用综合节能技术后，冬季生产只靠太阳能而完全不用煤，塑料日光温室生产的喜温蔬菜的上市期一如加温温室，但产量却大幅度提高，蔬菜价格明显下降。
