Capital legal scholars held a symposium today, organized by the Ministry of Justice and the Chinese Law Society, to criticize bourgeois liberalization views. They emphasized that a crucial task in the current legal field is to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, correct misguided legal theories, and rectify the confusion caused by bourgeois liberalization.

Legal experts pointed out that over the years, under the correct guidance of the policies and principles established by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, and through the joint efforts of legal and judicial workers, legal theory research has made significant progress. This has played an active role in the construction of socialist democracy and legal system, as well as in the development of both material and spiritual civilizations. However, due to the long-term influence of bourgeois liberalization, legal theory research has become chaotic, with some aspects and issues showing severe problems. This cannot be underestimated and must be corrected; at the same time, it is necessary to adhere to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as guidance and strive to advance the study of Marxism with Chinese characteristics in the field of law.

Minister of Justice Cai Cheng presided over the meeting. Experts and scholars from the Chinese Law Society, Peking University, Renmin University of China, China University of Political Science and Law, and the People's Public Security University of China, as well as relevant officials from the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supreme People's Court, participated in the symposium.

Wang Shuwen, Vice President of the Chinese Law Society and a constitutional law expert, said that one important feature of bourgeois liberalization in the legal field is its opposition to the Four Cardinal Principles. They have made a big deal out of amending the Constitution, advocating for comprehensive changes in political, economic, state institutions, party leadership, and guiding ideology. The essence of this is to oppose the inclusion of the Four Cardinal Principles in the Constitution. He pointed out that it is well known that the Constitution of our country stipulates in the Preamble that the Four Cardinal Principles must be upheld. This is a conclusion drawn from the long-term practical experience of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and it is unshakable. The most fundamental conclusion of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle over the past century is that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China.

Professor Xiao Weiyun of Peking University's constitutional law department believes that the Four Cardinal Principles are the overall guiding ideology of the Constitution and the fundamental guarantee for socialist revolution and construction. He said that if the Four Cardinal Principles are denied, the Constitution will lose its core. We will not allow anyone to use the names of reform and opening up to change the fundamental spirit of the Constitution, which is the Four Cardinal Principles.

Professors Lian Xisheng of China University of Political Science and Law, Sun Guohua, and Gao Mingxuan of Renmin University of China also spoke. They analyzed and criticized the views advocated by those who insist on bourgeois liberalization, such as "separation of powers," "parliamentary system," denial of the class nature of law, denial of the existence of Marxist legal theory, and denial of the guidance of Marxism in legal research.

Jiu Jianming, Deputy Secretary of the Party Group and Executive Vice President of the Chinese Law Society, emphasized in his speech that the legal community should vigorously promote the study and mastery of Marxism, using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to research, answer, and expound on new issues in the construction of socialist democracy and legal system. He said that we should, under the premise of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, truly implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, and continue to carry out academic exchanges with foreign countries. Following the principle of "using foreign knowledge for Chinese purposes," we should combine China's actual situation, take the essence and discard the dregs of foreign academic achievements, and critically learn and draw from them.

Cai Cheng pointed out at the symposium that law is an important component of social sciences, taking national legal systems as its research objects and having an extremely close relationship with politics. The fundamental purpose of socialist legal theory research is to serve the maintenance and consolidation of the socialist state power led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. It is precisely because of the special and important position of legal theory research that it has become a fiercely contested domain for those who insist on the stance of bourgeois liberalization. Therefore, the criticism of bourgeois liberalization in legal research is essentially a serious political struggle.

He said that in recent years, a small number of people who have long stubbornly insisted on the stance of bourgeois liberalization have created considerable chaos in legal research on some major issues, spreading many views that are politically reactionary, theoretically unscientific, and extremely harmful in practice. The essence of this is to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China, oppose the socialist system, and oppose the people's democratic dictatorship in legal research.

Cai Cheng listed some manifestations of bourgeois liberalization thought in the legal field and said that it is both necessary and urgent to carry out a struggle against bourgeois liberalization in the legal research field. It is a pressing matter that cannot be delayed. He required all legal organizations, political and legal colleges and departments, legal news and publishing departments, and judicial administrative agencies at all levels to adhere to the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in legal theory research, teaching, and legal publicity work. They must firmly adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, and expose and criticize from a theoretical perspective the bourgeois legal views spread by a small number of people in the legal community. They must clarify various confused understandings; expose their use of bourgeois legal views to mislead young students and attempt to reverse the direction of legal construction and socialism; and currently expose the evil deeds of a small number of people who plotted turmoil, riots, and political conspiracies, using the banner of "promoting democracy and improving the legal system" to destroy democracy, trample on the Constitution and laws. They must seriously study and analyze China's national conditions, strengthen the education of national conditions, patriotism, and Marxist basic theories for middle-aged and young scholars, and conduct legal theory research based on China's actual situation, serving socialist democratic politics, legal construction, economic construction, and reform and opening up.

    首都法学界人士座谈批判资产阶级自由化观点
    法学思想理论必须正本清源
    新华社北京8月5日电  首都法学界部分专家、学者今天在司法部和中国法学会召开的座谈会上提出，当前法学领域的一个重要任务是认真学习、贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，正本清源，把被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的法学思想理论问题纠正过来。
    法学专家们指出，这些年来，在党的十一届三中全会以来的正确路线、方针、政策的指引下，经过广大法学工作者、法律工作者的共同努力，法学理论研究有了很大发展，对社会主义民主与法制建设和两个文明建设起了积极的作用。但是，由于资产阶级自由化长期泛滥的影响，使法学理论研究工作中产生了混乱现象，甚至在某些方面、某些问题上表现得相当严重。对此不能低估，要认真进行正本清源；同时，必须坚持以马克思主义、毛泽东思想为指导，努力推进具有中国特色的马克思主义的法学研究。
    司法部部长蔡诚主持了会议。中国法学会、北京大学、中国人民大学、中国政法大学、中国人民公安大学的专家、学者以及公安部、最高人民检察院和最高人民法院的有关同志参加了座谈。
    中国法学会副会长、宪法学专家王叔文说，在法学领域内资产阶级自由化的一个重要特点就是反对四项基本原则。他们在修改宪法的问题上大做文章，主张要对宪法从政治、经济、国家制度、党的领导、指导思想等方面全面修改，其实质就是反对把坚持四项基本原则写入宪法。他指出，众所周知，我国宪法在《序言》中规定，必须坚持四项基本原则。这是中国各族人民从长期的切身经验中得出的不可动摇的结论。我国人民近一百多年来革命斗争最基本的结论是没有共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义才能救中国，也只有社会主义才能发展中国。
    北京大学宪法学教授肖尉云认为，四项基本原则是宪法总的指导思想，是社会主义革命和建设的根本保证。他说，如果否定四项基本原则，宪法就没有了核心。我们决不允许借改革、开放之名，把四项基本原则这个宪法的基本精神改掉。
    中国政法大学教授廉希圣、中国人民大学教授孙国华和高铭暄等也先后发言。他们就坚持资产阶级自由化的人鼓吹的“三权分立”，“议会制”，以及否定法的阶级性、否认马克思主义法学理论的存在、否定马克思主义对法学研究的指导等观点，进行了分析、批判。
    中国法学会党组副书记、常务副会长朱剑明在发言中强调，法学界要大力提倡学习、掌握马克思主义，运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，研究、回答和阐述社会主义民主和法制建设中的新问题。他说，我们应当在坚持四项基本原则的前提下切实贯彻“双百”方针，同时要继续坚持开展对外学术交流活动，本着“洋为中用”的原则，结合我国的实际，对国外学术成果取其精华，去其糟粕，批判地学习、借鉴。
    蔡诚在座谈会上指出，法学是社会科学的一个重要组成部分，它以国家法律制度作为自己的研究对象，与政治有着极其密切的关系。社会主义法学理论研究的根本目的是为维护和巩固工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家政权服务。正是由于法学理论研究的这种特殊重要的地位，它必然成为那些坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人所激烈争夺的领域。所以，对法学研究中资产阶级自由化思潮的批判，实质上是一场严肃的政治斗争。
    他说，近年来，法学界极少数长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，在法学研究的一些重大问题上制造了相当严重的混乱，散布了不少在政治上是反动的、在理论上是违反科学的、在实践中是极其有害的观点，其实质是在法学研究中反对中国共产党的领导，反对社会主义制度，反对人民民主专政。
    蔡诚列举了资产阶级自由化思想在法学领域的一些表现后说，在法学研究领域开展反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，不仅十分必要，而且十分迫切，是当前和今后刻不容缓的一件大事。他要求各法学团体、政法院校系、法律新闻和出版部门以及各级司法行政机关，在法学理论研究、教学和法制宣传工作中，必须坚持马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法，坚持四项基本原则，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，从理论上充分揭露批判极少数人在法学界散布的资产阶级法律观点，澄清各种糊涂认识；要揭露他们运用资产阶级的法学观点来迷惑青年学生，企图扭转法制建设和社会主义方向的阴谋；当前要充分揭露极少数策划动乱、暴乱、搞政治阴谋的人，打着“推进民主、健全法制”的旗号，破坏民主、践踏宪法和法律的罪恶行径。要认真研究、分析中国的国情，加强对中青年学者的国情教育、爱国主义教育和马克思主义基本理论的教育，从中国的实际出发，脚踏实地地从事法学理论研究，为我国社会主义民主政治服务，为社会主义法制建设服务，为经济建设服务，为改革开放服务。
