It is with great pleasure that we learn of the convening of the National Conference to Summarize Ten Years of Comprehensive Quality Management. We extend our warm greetings to all the delegates and, through you, to all the workers and technical personnel throughout the country who are engaged in quality management work!

Over the past ten years since our country began to implement comprehensive quality management, enterprises have increasingly recognized the importance of improving product quality. The quality of some industrial products has become more stable, and the technical performance and quality grades of some products have gradually adopted international standards. Significant achievements have been made. However, the problem of low product quality and poor enterprise performance remains a serious issue in our country's economic development. This must be given high attention by all parties, and effective measures must be taken to reverse the situation.

Product quality is a reflection of the work of all aspects and requires the concern and support of the Party and the government. Government departments, especially comprehensive departments, must establish and improve the quality supervision and assessment system in the process of rectification and deepening reform, strictly implement the policy of supporting the strong and restricting the weak, and promote technological progress. We must vigorously promote and popularize comprehensive quality management and gradually foster a social atmosphere where everyone cares about quality.

    江泽民李鹏的贺信
    欣闻全国推行全面质量管理十周年总结大会的召开，谨向与会代表，并通过你们向全国从事质量管理工作的广大职工和技术人员致以亲切的问候！
    我国推行全面质量管理十年来，企业对提高产品质量重要性的认识有了提高，一些工业产品质量日趋稳定，一些产品的技术性能和质量档次逐步采用国际标准，成绩很大。但是，产品质量低、企业效益差，仍然是我国经济发展中的一个严重问题，必须引起各方面的高度重视，采取有力措施加以扭转。
    产品质量是各方面工作的综合反映，需要党和政府的关心和支持。政府各部门首先是综合部门要在治理整顿和深化改革中，建立健全质量监督考核制度，严格实行扶优限劣的政策，推动技术进步。要大力宣传和推广全面质量管理，逐步形成大家都来关心质量的社会风气。
