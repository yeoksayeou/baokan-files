Exam cheating, an age-old problem, has become increasingly rampant in recent times. During regular school exams, cheating has become a common occurrence, which is not surprising; even the crucial entrance exams, which determine a student’s future, have been tainted. Otherwise, it is hard to imagine how a class’s exam papers could have some scoring 91 and others 86, with identical mistakes on all the papers. This is truly astonishing! Cheating methods have also evolved. For instance, hiding notes in small slips of paper or writing them on one’s arms (covering them with long sleeves on hot days) requires considerable effort. Recently, there have been reports of a new method called “small hole projection”—simply drill a small hole in the desk, place the book under the desk, and you can see it clearly through the hole. This is truly a modern-day innovation for cheaters! But this is still individual cheating. There are also group efforts. For example, for multiple-choice questions, there are signals like touching the forehead, nose, or ears to indicate the answers. This non-verbal communication is difficult for even the most diligent proctors to decipher. I suspect that the students who all scored the same might have used this method—who says our students lack creativity? The variety and ingenuity of their methods could fill a sequel to “The Scholars”!

If cheating were just a student issue, it might not be too difficult to eradicate. Unfortunately, it often happens with the tacit approval or even encouragement of some teachers, and in some cases, teachers are the masterminds! Students, when faced with unfamiliar proctors, often try a few cheating moves as a “feeler” to gauge the teacher’s reaction. After this “reconnaissance,” they decide whether to be cautious or to cheat openly. If they encounter a “cold-blooded” or “iron-fisted” teacher (students’ terms for strict and conscientious proctors), they have no choice but to accept their bad luck! Some teachers, after strictly proctoring an exam, even apologize to the class teacher: “Today, I’m really sorry for your class; it might affect your class’s scores.” During entrance exams, which are usually proctored by external teachers, there are instances where teachers sneak into the exam room to guide or hint at their own students. There are also cases where teachers pair good students with poor ones in adjacent seats to help each other. In this way, “teaching quality” truly improves! It’s a pity that these teachers’ efforts are misplaced!

The prevalence of cheating first violates the principle of “equality before scores.” It leads to situations where good students score lower than poor ones. Why? Because cheating is not effectively stopped, allowing cheaters to benefit while honest students suffer. Under the constraint of limited enrollment quotas, “one more lucky advancer, one more true talent suppressed,” resulting in the inferior replacing the superior! The prevalence of cheating also undermines the credibility of exams, making the sacred and just scores “fuzzy”—worthless and untrustworthy!

Improper exam and academic ethics also threaten the deterioration of social ethics; or conversely, improper exam and academic ethics are a microcosm of society’s improper winds. In the 1950s and 1960s, if cheating was discovered, students would feel ashamed. Today, cheating is rampant, and students no longer blush. This cannot but be seen as a significant failure of our school education!

When will the cheating trend end? It seems that it must start from the school’s serious rectification of academic and school ethics, with teachers taking this as a top priority, supplemented by parents’ supervision. Especially for new students, establishing good rules from the start is crucial. If schools and families work together, and teachers and parents join hands, preventing children from falling into the cheating trap, encouraging them to study diligently and live uprightly, it would truly be a blessing for children and the nation!

### “多一幸进，必抑一真才”——考试作弊何时了

    “多一幸进，必抑一真才”
    ——考试作弊何时了
    成城
    科场舞弊，古已有之，岂料于今愈演愈烈。
    学校平日期中期末考试，作弊已成家常便饭，自不必说；就是关系到“一分定终身”的升学统考，也已受到污染。不然根本无法想象：一个班的试卷，一部分都是91分、另一部分都是86分；不仅得分相同，且错处全都一样，岂非咄咄怪事！作弊方法也日渐进步。譬如夹带，抄在小条上，抄在手臂上（大热天穿长袖衫盖之）也颇费功夫，近闻有了“小孔成像”——只消在书桌上钻一个小孔，预先可把夹入考场的书本径放书桌内，透过小孔即可一览无余了。真个是现代文抄公的新发明！但这还属个体作业，更有群体协作辅之。譬如对那些ABCD的选择题，就有以摸前额摸鼻子摸左右耳朵的暗号联系，这种非语言交流，是尽职尽责的监考者也难破译的。我想那一行行座位上都得了一个分儿的，可能就是用了此法所获——谁说我们的学生没有创造性？那手法之多、运用之妙，是直可写进《儒林外史》续集的。我常想这点聪明倘用在复习上，何愁不得高分儿？只可惜用的不是地方！
    作弊倘都是学生的事，怕也不愁杜绝。遗憾的是，它往往是被一些老师睁一只眼闭一只眼姑息纵容所致，更有甚者，还有老师一手导演的！学生如遇陌生老师监场，往往先来一两手作弊的假动作“投石问路”，看看老师反应如何，经过这番“火力侦察”，即可决定是严加防范还是大模大样地去作弊。如遇“冷血动物”、“铁血人物”（学生对精明严格恪尽职守的监考老师的称谓），学生只好自认晦气！以致有的老师监考严了，下来还要向该班班主任道歉：“今儿个可真有点儿对不起您班了，可能影响点儿您班的分数”。升学考试本是易校监考，也有混迹于本校考场内对自己的学生加以现场指导或暗示的，也有事先把学习好的与学习差的学生搭配到相邻座位上，以便他们“一帮一、一对红”的。如此等等，“教学质量”就真上去了一大截！难为了这些老师煞费苦心——也只可惜这番心思用的不是地方！
    作弊的成风，首先是破坏了“分数面前人人平等”的公平原则。遂出现了学习好的学生考分儿不如差生的事情。缘何？只因制止无力，遂使作弊者受益，老实人吃亏。在限定招生名额的情况下，“多一幸进，必抑一真才”，竟造成劣胜优汰的结果！作弊的成风，也破坏了考试的信誉，使神圣公正的分数变“毛”——不值钱、不可信了！
    考风学风不正，也在危及社会风气不正；或者反过来，考风学风不正，也是社会不正之风的一个缩影。50年代60年代倘有作弊事发，学生会觉得无地自容，而今作弊泛滥，学生已经连脸都不红，这不能不说是我们学校教育的一大失误！
    作弊之风何时了？似乎还要从学校严肃学风校风、老师以此为一要事入手，辅之以家长的督促。尤其是新生入学，规矩好立。倘学校与家庭通力合作，老师与家长紧密携手，不使孩子再入作弊的泥潭，老老实实地学习，堂堂正正地做人，真是儿童少年之幸、民族之幸呢！
