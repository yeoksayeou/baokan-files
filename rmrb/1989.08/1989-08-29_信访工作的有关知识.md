Letters and visits work involves people who use writing letters or visiting to express their intentions to social organizations and their management. These individuals or groups can be categorized as follows:

1. The represented objects in letters and visits activities, which can be individuals or their agents, social groups (a combination of people within a social relationship), or social aggregates (a group of people without a formed social relationship).
2. Specific letters and visits individuals, who are the initiators of letters and visits activities. Any individual or group can become a letters and visits individual.

Forms of letters and visits include language and actions. Letters and visits language can be verbal and visual (through spoken language, telephone, recordings, videos, and images), literary language (through written text), and finger language (sign language). Actions in letters and visits refer to the use of non-verbal communication methods such as facial expressions, gestures, and posture to carry out letters and visits activities, such as crying, shouting, striking, and kneeling.

The components of letters and visits activities include the letters and visits individuals, the letters and visits recipients, the forms of letters and visits, the content of letters and visits, and the results of letters and visits handling.

Letters and visits jurisdiction refers to the division of labor among social organization managers in letters and visits activities. The principles for determining letters and visits jurisdiction are as follows:

Geographical principle. The letters and visits receiving department is determined by the region, system, and unit where the letters and visits individuals are located; the letters and visits receiving department is determined by the location where the letters and visits issue occurred.

Departmental functional principle. The letters and visits receiving department is determined by the content of the letters and visits; the letters and visits content to be received is determined by the department's functions. Functional agencies include leadership and management agencies, supervisory and enforcement agencies, judicial agencies, media agencies, and social organizations.

Letters and visits handling refers to the process and results of social organization managers receiving and reviewing letters and visits. The general handling procedure is to first conduct an initial review of the facts, understanding the letters and visits individuals' background, the main content of the letters and visits, the persuasiveness, and social value, and then decide on the handling method. Handling methods include transfer, correspondence transfer, self-inspection, joint investigation, reporting for review, examination and feedback, and inspection and implementation.

Letters and visits studies is a scientific discipline that studies the laws of letters and visits, explores the generation and development of letters and visits, and researches how letters and visits work can serve society and citizens. The content of letters and visits studies is rich, including basic theories of letters and visits, history of letters and visits, functions of letters and visits, laws of letters and visits, supervision of letters and visits, secretarial work of letters and visits, archives of letters and visits, psychology of letters and visits, prediction of letters and visits, legal studies of letters and visits, errors in letters and visits, and sociology of letters and visits.
