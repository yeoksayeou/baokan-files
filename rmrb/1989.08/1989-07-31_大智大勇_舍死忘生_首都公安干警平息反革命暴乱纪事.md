Beijing public security officers, in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and defending the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist republic, faced the frenzied attacks of violent criminals and the assaults of misled crowds. They demonstrated great wisdom and bravery, enduring the trials of blood and fire.

“Quick and decisive, charge forward!”

At around 2 PM on June 3, the violent criminals attacked soldiers, beat up armed police, and public security officers, which was appalling. Two military vehicles carrying weapons and ammunition, along with the escorting soldiers, were besieged near Six Departments for nearly 10 hours. If no decisive measures were taken, the weapons and ammunition would fall into the hands of the violent criminals, with unimaginable consequences. The Beijing Public Security Bureau decided: with the riot control team of the Public Security Bureau as the main force, along with officers from the East and West City districts and traffic police, to quickly launch a rescue mission. When the team marched from the west gate of Zhongnanhai to within 100 meters of Six Departments, bottles and stones rained down on them. The officers repeatedly made announcements, but to no avail. The 46 riot control team members were all indignant and quickly formed a fan-shaped formation, shouting as they charged forward. In an instant, the crowd was driven to the east, west, and south exits, and the officers guarded the exits while others helped the military move the weapons and ammunition. Seeing this, the violent criminals shouted and rushed back to surround the ammunition vehicles. Stones and bottles were thrown even more fiercely. The situation was urgent, and the officers had to fire the first tear gas canister. The violent criminals scattered, but soon returned to attack the officers. The riot control team members had to take out their shields, batons, and engage in a tug-of-war with the violent criminals. This tug-of-war lasted for over an hour before they successfully covered their comrades' retreat.

Six hours later, the atmosphere in Beijing became even more tense. At Anhe Bridge in Haidian District, thousands of people blocked the military's entry into the city. A violent criminal climbed onto the roof of a military vehicle and incited, “They are coming into the city to suppress the students, block them!” Ten or more concrete pipes with a diameter of one meter were pushed to the center of the road, and four to five thousand people completely blocked the entire road.

The 50 officers from Haidian Sub-bureau who rushed to the scene stopped outside the crowd. Then they heard the firm and decisive order from the bureau leader: “Quick and decisive, charge forward!” The 50 officers shouted in unison and charged into the crowd. Those sitting on the roadblocks and climbing onto the military vehicles scattered like rats. The officers took the opportunity to remove the roadblocks, direct the military vehicles, and guide the crowd, taking up positions to guard. After being blocked for over two hours, the 137 military vehicles finally started moving. As the military vehicles passed by the police, shouts of “Long live the police!” and “Long live the People's Liberation Army!” echoed through the air.

“Risking our lives, we must rescue the soldiers and military vehicles”

At 11 PM on June 3, the officers from the Criminal Investigation Brigade of Xicheng Sub-bureau launched a battle to transfer military vehicles and weapons and ammunition at Xidan intersection.

Two military vehicles had been surrounded by some violent criminals and misled crowds for 22 hours. Some violent criminals stripped the military uniforms off the soldiers and proudly laughed while holding them up with bamboo poles. Some spat on the soldiers, some pointed at the soldiers' noses and cursed, and some shouted “Down with the People's Liberation Army” while punching and kicking the soldiers. The violent criminals even dragged a military officer onto the roof of the vehicle, forced a helmet onto his head, and beat him while making him bow his head and confess, until the officer was tortured to the point of unconsciousness... The soldiers endured the physical and mental torture with great restraint, calmly and silently.

The officers watched in anger and could no longer suppress their fury. “Risking our lives, we must rescue the soldiers and military vehicles!” Since they couldn't openly transfer the vehicles in uniform, the 70 officers quickly changed into civilian clothes.

Director Yan Guozhang led the investigators Xiao Liu and Xiao Zhang to put on white coats and jump onto the ambulance, clearing the way for the military vehicle loaded with 100 submachine guns, one machine gun, and 4 pistols, along with over 30,000 rounds of ammunition.

Just as the vehicle was about to start, a violent criminal suddenly stuck his arm into the vehicle and grabbed Yan Guozhang, asking, “Who are you? What are you doing?” “Take them down, beat them!” the nearby violent criminals echoed.

“We are from the Health Bureau, helping to transport weapons for an exhibition.” Yan Guozhang responded calmly.

“They are helping us with the weapon exhibition.” The investigators below also echoed.

The violent criminals didn't believe them and shouted, “Don't let the weapons be taken away, burn them here!” Two violent criminals shouted and pushed their way onto the ambulance, saying, “If you want to go, go together, let's see where you can take the weapons?” Some misled crowds also pushed their way onto the vehicle. Yan Guozhang didn't hesitate, kicked the violent criminal in front of him away from the door with force, and quickly closed the door. He ordered the driver, “Start the car!” The ambulance's red lights flashed, breaking through the siege.

After driving 100 meters, they were stopped by the crowd again at the Commercial Department building. “Where are you going?” the person blocking the military vehicle asked. “To rescue the injured!” Yan Guozhang pointed to the investigators Xiao Liu and Xiao Zhang, who were pretending to be injured and lying on the vehicle.

In this way, they improvised and outsmarted the violent criminals, overcoming six obstacles. Each time they passed an obstacle, Yan Guozhang sweated profusely. When they reached Ganjiapu intersection, they saw another part of the martial law troops besieged there. Several buses were parked in the middle of the road, blocking the way, and they couldn't pass. Yan Guozhang reminded himself, “Stay calm, think of a way, and get through as soon as possible!” He alertly observed the surroundings and, seeing many people, quickly came up with an idea. He pointed at the roadblock and shouted to the crowd, “Our rescued injured are very dangerous, please help us clear the roadblock and let our ambulance pass.” Seeing Yan Guozhang's anxious face, someone jumped onto the bus used as a roadblock and tried to start it. Seeing that the car didn't start immediately, Yan Guozhang announced, “Please help us push the car.” The onlookers all started pushing, clearing the way. Yan Guozhang and the others quickly passed through and finally safely transferred the military vehicle and weapons and ammunition to a certain military compound.

The hanging heart finally relaxed.

“At any cost, protect Tiananmen Gate Tower”

At the same time, the violent criminals placed a 17th route double-decker bus in front of the Tiananmen Gate Tower under the giant statue of Chairman Mao. They howled, “Burn the gate tower, burn Tiananmen!” The situation was extremely urgent!

The bureau leaders ordered in a firm and powerful voice, “At any cost, protect Tiananmen Gate Tower!” Deputy Director Zhang Keting and Gao Dehuan of Dongcheng Sub-bureau immediately mobilized the 50 officers on standby at Tiananmen and launched an attack. Deputy Director Gao, with bloodshot eyes, shot out a cold, scorching light—over the past 50 days, to defend the Party and the motherland, the officers of Tiananmen Police Station had been fighting day and night, working 100,000 hours, equivalent to 12,500 working days. Endurance has its limits. “Comrades, someone wants to burn Tiananmen Gate Tower, we will fight them to the end!” The officers, who were already furious, heard the mobilization order. Some grabbed wooden sticks, some grabbed broomsticks, some grabbed fire hooks... like tigers descending the mountain, they shouted and rushed towards the violent criminals. A heart-pounding struggle, the violent criminals were pressed to the south side of Jinshui Bridge.

At this time, some officers guarded the five bridgeheads of Jinshui Bridge, while others bravely extinguished the burning bus. Due to the large fire, the hair of Deputy Director of the Criminal Investigation Brigade, Jiao Hongwei, was singed, but he paid no attention and jumped onto the car, grabbing the hot steering wheel. The other comrades worked together, finally pushing the bus away from Tiananmen Square.

Just as the danger of the Tiananmen Gate Tower being burned was averted, the Tiananmen Police Station was attacked by over 200 people. Some shouted, “Destroy the police station, kill the police!” At this time, there were only Deputy Director Kang Jianjun and 12 other comrades in the police station, outnumbered. The deputy director, Gao Xiaochen, who was fighting at Tiananmen Gate Tower, heard the news and led over 30 officers to reinforce the police station from Zhongshan Park. A few minutes later, the police station was surrounded by shouts, and the officers bravely and tenaciously drove away the attacking crowd.

At this time, part of the martial law troops had entered Tiananmen Square, and the violent criminals' plot to destroy Tiananmen Gate Tower was completely foiled! The military and police couldn't help but shout and jump for joy.

Capturing violent criminals, rescuing comrades, protecting military vehicles

At 2 AM, Yongwai Street. Six sweaty martial law troops were pulled out of the marching queue by violent criminals and beaten, their lives in danger.

“Save them!” With the order from Yongwai Police Station Director Zhu Lianfu, 30 officers rushed out of the police station, forming a human wall to protect the six soldiers with their bodies. At this moment, a brick flew towards a soldier, and Zhu Lianfu, quick and sharp, used his body to block it. The brick hit his right arm, instantly leaving a purple bruise. He paid no attention and cleverly divided the officers into several small groups to escort the soldiers out of the siege.

At this moment, only shouts and curses could be heard. Suddenly, police officer Li Xinan shouted, “Catch him!” He darted out of the crowd like an arrow, chasing after three armed violent criminals. Li Xinan's 100-meter speed was 12.6 seconds, and he chased like the wind. Soon, he caught up with the violent criminals at Anlin West: “Stop, don't move!” The armed violent criminals, seeing Li Xinan catching up, hurriedly handed the gun to their accomplice. At this moment, Li Xinan rushed forward, aimed, and forcefully grabbed the gun. Some violent criminals and misled crowds threw stones at Li Xinan. To ensure that the seized gun would not be taken away again, Li Xinan quickly pulled the trigger, scaring the people away. At 10 AM that day, some people in the You'anmen area pushed a military vehicle onto You'anmen Bridge. The officers from You'anmen Police Station, who had been mobilizing the crowd and secretly guarding for dozens of hours, dressed in civilian clothes, formed a fan shape and pushed their way to the front of the crowd. At this time, a person said to the onlookers, “Burn it, burn it quickly!” He then lit a piece of paper and threw it into the fuel tank. Seeing that the fire was not big, he climbed onto the car, lit the clothes and blankets on the car, and grabbed a package of military uniforms, pushing his way out of the crowd and leaning against the railing as if nothing had happened...

The anger in the officers' hearts was also burning. The time to capture the criminal had finally come. Someone in the crowd shouted, “There are more military vehicles over there!” Deputy Director Zhou Jialin saw the opportunity and signaled to the people here, “Quick, go and see.” The arsonist did not leave. “Brother, someone is looking for you.” Police officer Han Wenguang cleverly approached the violent criminal. The violent criminal believed it and followed him. When he walked in front of Deputy Director Zhao Weimin, he realized and tried to escape, but was caught by the police.

The crowd gathered around. “Brother, don't keep it all to yourself, give me some.” The officers cleverly said, and escorted the violent criminal away. Some people followed. Zhou Jialin picked up a brick and said to the followers, “This is our brother's business, none of your concern. Whoever comes, I'll beat them up.” The followers stopped, and the violent criminal was taken to the police station. He was the first arsonist of military vehicles captured in the city.

At this time, at the bridgehead, a few violent criminals overturned the military ambulance and set the military vehicle on fire. After the fire started, a person hid to one side, pretending to be dumb and stupid, saying, “Who started this fire, great!” He said while walking, trying to leave the scene. Deputy Director Shi Fusheng and others followed closely. When they reached the right side of You'anmen Pharmacy, the violent criminal discovered that someone was following him and ran away, but finally couldn't escape the law. To prevent the misled people from causing trouble, the police ordered the violent criminal in a low voice, “Hum a tune!” The violent criminal nodded, and his hands were already tied behind his back, but he was covered with clothes as a disguise. “Hum a tune!” The police ordered again, and the violent criminal smiled awkwardly and hummed. In this way, under the clever control of the police, they passed through layer after layer of people, and the criminal was taken away. Under the protection of the officers, the 191 military vehicles parked here, except for 4 that were burned, were all intact. History will forever remember the achievements of Beijing public security officers in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

    大智大勇  舍死忘生
    ——首都公安干警平息反革命暴乱纪事
    陈友
    首都公安干警在平息反革命暴乱、捍卫共产党的领导和社会主义共和国时，面对丧心病狂的暴徒和不明真相群众的围攻、殴打，显示出大智大勇，经历了血与火的考验。
      “速战速决，冲过去！”
    6月3日下午2时左右，暴徒们围攻军人、殴打武警、公安干警，令人发指。戒严部队某部两辆武器弹药车和押车的军人被围困在六部口近10小时，如不采取果断措施，武器弹药一旦落入暴徒手中，后果不堪设想。北京市公安局决定：以治安处防暴队为主力，会同东、西城干警及交通民警迅速出击营救。当队伍从中南海西门行至距六部口百米处时，汽水瓶、石块，雨点般向他们投来。干警们反复宣传，仍不奏效。46名防暴队员个个义愤填膺，迅速成扇面列阵，呐喊着迎面冲上去。刹那间，人群被驱赶到东、西、南三个路口以外，干警们有的守住路口，有的和解放军一起搬运武器弹药。见状，暴徒们狂呼乱叫着又向弹药车聚拢、围攻。石块、汽水瓶更加猛烈地砸过来。情况紧急，干警们被迫打出第一发催泪弹，暴徒们四散而逃。但不一会，又返回来围攻干警。防暴队员们只得拿起盾牌、警棍和暴徒们展开搏斗。就这样打了一个多小时的拉锯战，终于掩护战友转移出去。
    时隔6小时，北京城气氛更加紧张。海淀区安河桥，成千的人围堵戒严部队进城。一名暴徒爬到军车顶上，煽动说：“他们进城镇压学生，堵住啊！”十几根直径一米粗的水泥管子推到路中央，四五千人将整个道路堵得水泄不通。
    赶来营救的海淀分局50名干警在人群外停下来。接着就听到局领导果断有力地命令：“速战速决，冲过去！”50人齐声呐喊，冲进人群，坐在路障和爬上军车的暴徒四下鼠窜，干警们趁机有的拆除路障，指挥军车通行，有的疏导群众，担任警戒。137辆军车在被阻两个多小时后，终于启动。当军车驶过警察身边时，“警察万岁！”“解放军万岁！”等欢呼声响在空中。
  “豁出命，也要救出官兵和军车”
    6月3日晚11时。西城分局刑警队的干警们在西单路口展开一场转移军车和武器弹药的战斗。
    有两辆军车被一些暴徒和不明真相的群众围在这里已经22个小时。暴徒们有的扒下解放军官兵的军装，用竹竿挑着，得意地狂笑，有的往战士身上啐痰，有的指着战士鼻子谩骂，有的边喊“打倒解放军”，边对战士拳打脚踢。暴徒甚至把一名军官拽到车顶上，硬把头盔扣在他头上，边打边让他低头认罪，直到把这位军官折磨得昏迷过去……官兵们以极大的克制，冷静地、默默地忍受着肉体和精神上的折磨。
    干警们看在眼里，急在心头，再也按捺不住愤怒的心情了。“豁出命去，也要救出官兵和军车！”穿警服公开转移不行，70名干警们果断地穿上便衣。
    指导员阎国璋机智地带领侦察员小刘、小张换上白大褂，跳上急救车，为装着100支冲锋枪、一挺机枪和4支手枪、3万多发子弹的军车开道。
    车刚要启动，冷不防一名暴徒将胳膊伸进车内，揪住阎国璋问：“你们是哪里的？搞什么名堂？”“拉下来，打！”旁边的暴徒附和着。
    “卫生局的，帮忙运武器搞展览。”阎国璋应付自如。
    “他们是帮我们搞武器展览的。”车下的几名侦察员也附和着说。
    暴徒们不信这些，狂叫着说：“不许把武器拉走，就在这里烧了！”有两名暴徒边喊边向急救车上挤，说：“要走一齐走，看你们把武器运到哪儿？”一些不明真相的群众也跟着往上挤。阎国璋毫不犹豫，猛用力，一脚将挤在前边的暴徒踹离车门，同时用力关上门。他命令司机：“开车！”急救车红灯闪烁，突出了重围。
    车行了一百米远，到商业部大楼时，又被人群围住。“去干什么？”拦阻军车的人问。“送伤员！”阎国璋指着躺在车上装扮成伤员的侦察员小张、小刘说。
    就这样，他们随机应变，与暴徒斗智斗勇，连过六道障碍。每过一道，阎国璋都捏着一把汗。当行至甘家口路口时，见又一部分戒严部队被围困在这里，几辆公共汽车横在路中，挡住了去路，无法通过。阎国璋暗中提醒自己：“沉住气，想办法，一定要尽快通过去！”他机警地观察一下周围情况，见群众很多，他急中生智，指着路障对人群喊道：“我们抢救的伤员很危险，请大家帮忙把路障清开，让我们救护车通过。”看到阎国璋焦急的面孔，有人跳上被用作路障的公共汽车，试着开起来，见车没有马上启动，阎国璋又宣传说：“请大家帮忙推一下车吧。”围观群众纷纷动手，将车推开，腾出了通道。阎国璋等人迅速通过，终于将军车及武器弹药安全转移到某部队大院。
    悬着的心，这才放下来。
    “不惜一切代价，保住天安门城楼”
    在这同一时间里，暴徒们将一辆17路通道式公共汽车放在天安门城楼前毛主席巨像下。他们嚎叫着：“点了城楼，烧了天安门！”形势万分危急！
    市局领导用十分坚定有力的语气命令：“不惜一切代价，保住天安门城楼！”东城分局副局长张克锦、高德贤，立即集合在天安门备勤的50名干警出击。高副局长略带血丝的眼睛里喷射出冷峻、灼人的光——50天来，为了捍卫党和祖国，天安门派出所干警日夜奋战，加班10万小时，合1.25万多个工作日。忍耐是有极限的。“同志们，有人要烧天安门城楼，我们跟他们拚了！”早已怒不可遏的干警听到动员令，有的抄起木棍，有的抄起扫帚把，有的抄起消防叉……如猛虎下山，呼喊着扑向暴徒。一阵惊心动魄的厮打，暴徒们被压到金水桥南侧。
    这时，一部分干警守住金水桥五座桥头，一部分干警奋力扑灭燃烧的汽车，由于火势较大，刑警队副队长焦洪伟的头发被燎焦，但他全然不顾，纵身跳上车，抓住发烫的方向盘，其余同志齐心协力，终将这辆公共汽车推离天安门广场。
    天安门城楼被烧的危险刚解除，天安门派出所又被200多人围攻。有的人狂叫着：“砸毁派出所，杀死民警！”这时，派出所里只有副所长康健军等12名同志，寡不敌众。战斗在天安门城楼前的副所长高小臣闻讯，带领30多名干警从中山公园迂回，增援派出所。几分钟后，派出所前面吼声阵阵，干警们英勇顽强，将围攻群众驱散。
    这时，部分戒严部队已进入天安门广场，暴徒们毁坏天安门城楼的阴谋彻底破产了！军、警们情不自禁地欢呼跳跃。
      抓暴徒　救战友　保军车
    凌晨2时，永外大街上。6名汗水淋淋的戒严部队官兵，被暴徒们从行进的队伍里揪出来拳打脚踢，生命垂危。
    “救人！”随着永外派出所所长朱连富一声令下，30名干警冲出派出所，拉成人墙，用身体挡护这6名战士。这时，一块板砖飞向一名战士，朱连富手疾眼快，用身子去挡，砖头砸在他右手臂上，顿时起了个紫包。他全然不顾，机智地把干警分成几个小组，分头护送战士突围。
    此刻，只听见吼叫声、谩骂声混成一片。突然，民警李信安一声大喊：“抓住他！”他箭一般冲出人群，向三名持枪暴徒追去。小李百秒速度12秒6，追赶起来疾如风。不一会，在安林西口赶上了暴徒：“站住，不许动！”持枪暴徒见小李已追上，慌忙将枪交给同伴。就在这时，小李飞步向前，看准了一把抓住枪管，猛用力将枪夺在手中。一些暴徒和不明真相的群众一齐向小李投掷石块。为确保夺回的枪支不再被抢走，小李灵机一动，刷地拉响枪栓，将这些人喝退。当日10时，右安门地区一些家伙将一辆军车推到右安门大桥上。已在这里发动群众并暗中守护几十个小时的右安门派出所干警们，身着便衣，排成扇形挤到人群前边。这时，一个家伙对围观的人说：“烧呀，快烧呀！”说着，便点燃一张纸，扔在油箱内，见火势不大，他又爬上汽车，点燃了车上的衣、被，并随手抢走一包军衣，挤出人群，若无其事地靠在栏杆上观看……
    怒火，也在干警心中燃烧着。抓获案犯的时机终于到了。人群中，不知谁喊了一声：“那边又来军车了！”副所长周加林见机行事，招呼这里的人“快去看看。”烧车的这家伙没有走。“哥们，那边有人找你。”民警韩文广机智地靠近这暴徒。这家伙信以为真，跟着便走，当他走到副所长赵为民前时才明白过来，刚要逃走，被民警擒获。
    人群围过来。“哥们，别独吞，分我点。”干警们机智地说，并架着暴徒往前走。仍有人跟随着。周加林抄起砖头，对跟随的人说：“这是我们哥们的事，跟你们没关系，谁再来，我就揍谁。”尾随的人停在那里，这家伙被带到了派出所。他是全市第一个被抓获的焚烧军车的暴徒。
    这时，在桥头处，又有几名暴徒将军用救护车掀翻，并点燃军车。火起后，有一个家伙躲到一边装傻充愣地说：“这火谁点的，真棒！”边说边走，想逃离现场。副所长石富胜等人紧跟不放。当走到右安门药店时，这家伙发现有人跟他，撒腿便跑，但终于难逃法网。为防止不明真相的人找麻烦，民警低声责令这家伙：“哼小曲！”这家伙点头的功夫，双手已被反捆，但披上了衣服作掩护。“哼哼小曲！”民警再次喝令他，这家伙皮笑肉不笑地哼了起来。就这样，在民警巧妙的控制下，穿过一层层人群，罪犯被带走了。在干警的保护下，停放在这里的191辆军车，除4辆被烧外，187辆完好无损。历史将永远铭记首都公安干警平息反革命暴乱的功绩。
