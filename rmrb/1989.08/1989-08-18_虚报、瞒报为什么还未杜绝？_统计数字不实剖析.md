In the process of building a modernized socialist society, scientific decision-making is essential, and scientific decision-making is based on accurate statistical analysis. However, recent letters from readers and information from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that "unreliable statistical figures" are a cause for concern.

Some places still engage in false reporting and concealment

From the current nationwide inspection of the implementation of statistical laws and regulations, it can be seen that China's statistical figures are basically accurate and reflect the trends in national economic and social development. With the restoration of the Party's line of seeking truth from facts and the establishment and implementation of statistical laws and regulations, the quality and sensitivity of statistical figures have been further improved, providing a reliable basis for the state to formulate national economic and social development plans and guide economic operations. However, in some places and units, there are varying degrees of false reporting and concealment in statistics. The following are materials provided by the National Bureau of Statistics:

In Hebei's Baoding region, 81 cases of violating statistical laws were found, of which 71 were cases of false reporting and concealment. In Handan City, 95 cases of unreliable statistics were found, of which 92 were cases of false reporting and concealment.

In Jiangsu's Dan Yang City, some officials from the Statistics Bureau altered the sample survey figures for the city's autumn grain production in 1987 from 337,286 tons to 356,657 tons, over-reporting by 19,371 tons, an increase of 5.7%. In 1988, they altered the sample survey figures for the summer and autumn grain production from 424,471 tons to 454,854 tons, over-reporting by 30,383 tons, an increase of 7.2%. In these two years, some township-level units in Dan Yang City had varying degrees of false reporting and alteration of statistical figures when reporting the comprehensive tables for grain production, making the grain production figures seriously unreliable.

In Liaoning's Panjin City, 60 industrial enterprises above the municipal level were inspected, and 36 had issues with their reported output values, accounting for 60%. Of these, 29 were over-reported, and 17 were under-reported. The city also inspected 48 township enterprises, over-reporting the output value by 17.91 million yuan, more than double the actual output value. There were 29 enterprises with unreliable statistics, accounting for 60.4%. Three enterprises reported an output value of 2.4 million yuan as 38 million yuan, an increase of 14.8 times.

In 1988, Tianjin Communication Equipment Factory, in order to achieve the annual product variety plan, used the method of issuing inspection certificates for entry into the warehouse and reporting production first, and then making up for it in the first quarter of this year. They over-reported the production of dials by 2,637 units. In the first quarter of this year, the dials produced were used to make up for the shortfall of last year, and correspondingly, there was also an issue of under-reporting.

The main cause is human intervention

Similar problems of unreliable statistical figures have been found in many places. What are the causes? According to the analysis by the National Bureau of Statistics, in addition to the complex economic structure, diverse economic components, difficult management, and weak statistical methods and forces, the main cause is the administrative intervention by some local and unit leaders.

Using numbers for personal gain. Some leaders link the high or low statistical figures to their own fate. For personal gain, they intentionally fabricate false reports. The Party Committee Secretary of Jiao Xian Township in Guangxi's Shanglin County fabricated a false report in 1987, claiming that 10 indicators in 1986 had doubled compared to 1983. The method used was to lower the base number for 1983. A certain autonomous prefecture in Xinjiang issued a document specifically for the promotion of county leaders who had achieved the goal of doubling their output, and some county leaders said that whether or not they could double their output depended on the skills of the statistical department.

Localism. With the diversification of interests, statistical figures are more closely related to local interests, such as performance evaluations, taxation, fees, poverty alleviation, rewards and punishments, bonuses, etc. Some officials, in order to make their units gain more, over-report; in order to pay less, under-report. This phenomenon is more pronounced at the grassroots level and in township enterprises. Henan's Nanyang County over-reported the summer grain production in 1988 by 70 million jin. A certain county in Xinjiang reported a grain production of 580 million jin in 1988, but the county leaders decided to lower it by 30 million jin. According to reports from Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, the grain production in various counties has a margin of about 10%.

Superior's will. Many unreliable figures are pressed down level by level according to the leader's intentions. For example, the birth control rate is lower at each level, but in reality, it cannot be achieved. At the grassroots level, there is no choice but to engage in false reporting and concealment. A certain place in Henan reported 20,000 sterilization surgeries, but for the sake of fame and profit, 40,000 cases were reported. Some grassroots cadres said that the superiors press for output value, want to double it, and squeeze the numbers, which forces the lower levels to tell lies. When reporting statistical materials, there is such a strange phenomenon: the leaders are most concerned about which figures, and which figures are most likely to have false phenomena.

Investigation and handling face significant obstacles

Between administrative intervention and statistical figures, some places' statistical personnel are placed in a position where they can be manipulated by others, which makes statistical work frequently encounter interference, and cases of violating statistical regulations are difficult to investigate.

One situation is that leaders instruct statistical personnel to engage in false reporting and concealment, and statistical personnel have no choice but to comply. In 1988, the township leaders of Xibangcheng in Shanxi's Hunyuan County went to each village to demand that statistical personnel alter the figures because the contracted grain production target of 104 million jin was not completed. However, when problems arise, the leaders are not held accountable, and only the statistical personnel are investigated.

Another situation is that statistical personnel resist individual leaders' violations of statistical regulations, refuse to alter figures for false reporting and concealment, and even report the leaders' improper interventions, which results in criticism. In Hebei's Qinglong County, the statistical clerk Geng Yanrong of the Grain Bureau was deducted three months' salary for resisting false reporting and concealment. In 1984, Qiujiang Township in Fujian's Shaxian County over-reported the industrial output value by 13.9 million yuan to break the 100 million yuan mark for township enterprises, resulting in the township being awarded and publicized as an advanced example in the newspapers, while the statistical clerk who resisted false reporting and concealment was dismissed. This case has dragged on for four years without a fair resolution.

Some leaders' obstruction makes it even more difficult to handle the cases. The Statistical Bureau of Jilin City's suburban area decided to issue a circular criticizing and fining five units, including Guzi Shop Feed Processing Factory and Jiangnan Chemical Factory, for over-reporting and under-reporting output values, but this was opposed by a deputy district head and a deputy director of the Township Enterprise Management Bureau. It is even more difficult to handle cases involving units that have already received honors (the source of these honors is questionable). Shandong's Xintai Wool Mill was once rated as a national advanced unit, but in 1988, it over-reported the output value by one-third, and multiple investigations were obstructed. The director of a certain factory in Henan's Xinyang altered statistical figures and persecuted statistical personnel. After investigation, the situation was basically true, but because he was a recipient of the national May Day Medal, it was difficult to handle the case.

    虚报、瞒报为什么还未杜绝？
    统计数字不实剖析
    本报记者　郑红深
    搞四化建设，必须有科学的决策，而科学的决策又建立在准确的统计分析上。然而，从最近一些读者来信反映的问题和记者从国家统计局了解的情况看，“统计数字不实”值得警惕。
    有些地方仍在弄虚作假
    从目前正在进行的全国统计法规执行情况大检查看，我国的统计数字基本是准确的，反映了国民经济和社会发展的趋势。随着党的实事求是思想路线的恢复和统计法规的建立执行，统计数字质量和灵敏度有了进一步提高，为国家制定国民经济和社会发展计划，指导经济运行提供了可靠的依据。但是，在一些地方和单位的统计中，不同程度地存在着弄虚作假问题。下面是国家统计局提供的材料：
    河北保定地区共查出违反统计法行为81件，其中属于虚报瞒报的有71件。邯郸市查出统计不实的有95件，其中92件是虚报瞒报。
    江苏丹阳市统计局个别干部，将1987年丹阳市秋粮产量抽样调查数337286吨篡改为356657吨，多报19371吨，上升5.7％；1988年将夏秋两季粮产抽样调查数424471吨篡改为454854吨，多报30383吨，上升7.2％。丹阳市这两年部分基层乡镇在上报粮食产量全面报表时，不同程度地存在虚报、篡改统计数字的问题，使粮食产量数字严重不实。
    辽宁盘锦市抽查了60家市以上工业企业，有36家原报产值有问题，占60％，虚报的29家，瞒报的17家。这个市还抽查了48家乡镇企业，虚报产值1791万元，是实际产值的一倍多，统计不实的有29家，占60.4％，有3家企业把24万元产值虚报为380万元，上升14.8倍。
    天津通信设备厂1988年为追求年度品种计划的完成，采取先开检验单入库报产，到今年一季度再补齐的手段，虚报拔号盘产量2637只，今年一季度生产的拔号盘用来弥补上年的亏空，相应地又发生了瞒报的问题。
    主要原因乃是人为干扰
    类似统计数字不实的问题，各地查出不少。产生的原因是什么呢？据国家统计局的同志分析，除了现在经济结构复杂，经济成分多元，很难管理，和统计方法不适应，统计力量薄弱等客观原因外，一些地方和单位的领导人的行政干预是主要原因。
    以数谋私。某些领导干部把统计数字高低和自己的命运联系起来。为了自己的私利，有意在上报材料中造假。广西上林县桥贤乡党委书记为了骗取荣誉，1987年搞了一个1986年比1983年在10个指标上翻番的假材料，其手法是压低1983年的基数。新疆某自治州专门发文，为提前翻番的县主要领导提升一级工资，一些县领导就说，能否翻番，就看统计部门的本事了。
    本位主义。随着利益的多元化，统计数字与局部利益更密切相关，如考核、征税、收费、扶贫、奖惩、发奖金等，有的干部为了使本单位多得，便虚报；为了少纳，便瞒报。这种现象在基层、乡镇企业比较突出。河南南阳县虚报1988年夏粮产量7000万斤。新疆某县1988年粮产5800万斤，县领导研究后，压低了300万斤。据甘肃兰州市反映，各县粮产留有余地的占10％。
    长官意志。许多不实数字是按领导意图，层层压出来的。如计划生育率，一级比一级压得低，实际上又办不到，到了基层，只好弄虚作假，河南某地做结扎手术2万人，但为了名利，却上报4万例。一些基层干部说，上级压产值，要翻番，挤数字，这就逼着下边说假话。在上报统计材料时，有这样一种怪现象，领导同志最关心什么数字，什么数字就容易出现虚假现象。
    调查处理却又阻力不小
    在行政干预与统计数字之间，有些地方的统计人员就被放在了一个任人摆布的位置，这使统计工作屡遇干扰，违反统计法规的案件难以查究。
    一种情况是，领导人授意统计人员弄虚作假，统计人员不得不照办。山西浑源县西坊城镇，1988年承包的粮产1040万斤的指标未完成，镇领导人就下乡去一个村一个村地要统计人员篡改数字。而这类情况出了问题呢，又查不到领导人身上了，只查到统计人员头上。
    另一种情况是，统计人员抵制个别领导人违反统计法规的行为，拒绝为虚报瞒报而篡改数字，甚至举报领导人的不当干预，这就要遭到非难。河北青龙县粮食局统计员耿艳荣，因抵制弄虚作假，被扣发3个月工资。福建沙县虬江乡1984年为突破乡镇企业产值1000万元大关，虚报产值139万元，结果，这个乡既得了奖，又被报纸作为先进典型进行广为宣传，而抵制弄虚作假的统计员却被解聘。此案已拖了4年之久得不到公正处理。
    一些领导人的阻挠，使查处更难进行。吉林市郊区统计局决定对虚报瞒报产值的孤子店饲料加工厂、江南化工厂等5个单位进行通报批评和罚款，却遭到一副区长和乡镇企业管理局一副局长反对。特别是要查处一些已获得荣誉的单位的问题时，更困难一些（这些荣誉是如何得来的可存疑）。山东新泰市毛纺厂曾被评为全国先进单位，1988年虚报产值1／3，多次查处被阻挠。河南信阳某厂厂长篡改统计数字，打击迫害统计人员，经调查情况基本属实，但因他是全国五一奖章获得者，处理起来难度很大。
    由于统计数字不实的主要原因在于一些领导人的思想作风不端正，所以国家统计局的同志认为，要消除虚报瞒报等统计不实的行为，必须对领导干部严格要求，并从制度上防止以数谋私、谋荣誉、谋小集团利益的产生，从法律上严肃查处一切违反统计法规，搞弄虚作假的行为。使那些靠虚报瞒报过日子的领导人，不但得不到好处，而且不敢以身试法。
