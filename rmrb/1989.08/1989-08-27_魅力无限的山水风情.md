In the past, if you mentioned traveling to Guizhou, people would shake their heads. Guizhou has always been seen as a barren place of exile, with the saying "the sky has no three days of clear weather, the land has no three miles of flat ground"...

In recent years, the situation has changed. Guizhou has been given the titles of "Park Province" and "Karst National Park."

In the past, Guizhou was known for two things: Maotai wine and Huangguoshu Waterfall. However, before and after liberation, Huangguoshu Waterfall was merely a hidden natural wonder in the "southern wilderness." It was only after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee that it was developed for tourism. Tourist spots are called windows to the outside world, and as the first national scenic spot in Guizhou, Huangguoshu Waterfall is Guizhou's earliest window to the outside world. This window has been opened. To enrich it and complement it, other sites such as Anshun's Longgong, Qingzhen's Hongfeng Lake, and Zhijin Cave were developed, gradually forming a tourist route known as the Western Line in Guizhou.

Once the Western Line became feasible, people naturally began to think about the Eastern, Northern, and Southern Lines. Guizhou has unique tourism resources in all directions. Among them, the karst natural landscapes of the Western Line, the ethnic customs of the Eastern Line, and the historical sites of the Northern Line (Zunyi, Loushan Pass, and the Qingshui River) stand out. In just a few years, Guizhou's national-level scenic spots increased from one to five, and provincial-level scenic spots number in the dozens. Tourism facilities have also developed, with tourism bureaus and travel agencies established at various levels. Thus, Guizhou's tourism industry has developed from a single window to a route, from a route to multiple routes, and finally to a substantial front.

Guizhou's tourism is unique for its large waterfalls, large caves, and ethnic customs. The most famous waterfalls are Huangguoshu Waterfall and its waterfall group, followed by the Shizhangdong Waterfall and its waterfall group on a tributary of the Qingshui River in northern Guizhou. The most famous caves are the dry cave of Zhijin Cave, the water cave of Longgong, and the Huangguoshu Waterfall Cave, all concentrated on the Western Line. Ethnic customs are the main feature of the Eastern Line, but other tourist routes are also rich in this regard. Moreover, the large waterfalls, large caves, and ethnic customs are interrelated. The Huangguoshu Waterfall area has the Waterfall Cave, Tianxing Cave, and Zhidu Cave; Longgong has the Longmen Waterfall; Hongfeng Lake has the Fishing Cave and General's Cave; and Qingshui River also has caves and waterfalls. Almost all scenic spots are areas where ethnic minorities reside, such as the Buyi and Miao people around Huangguoshu, the Miao and Gelao people around Zhijin Cave, the Buyi people around Longgong, and the Miao people around Hongfeng Lake and Qingshui River. Zunyi is a wine town, and the Qingshui River is a river with the scent of wine. The wine culture, composed of Maotai wine, Dong wine, Xishui Daqu, Zhen wine, Yaxi cellar wine, and Meizhou cellar wine, is also a precious tourism resource.

Guizhou's mountains and rivers are charming, Guizhou's fine wines are charming, and Guizhou's ethnic customs are charming. This tourism virgin land of Guizhou is worth longing for.

### 魅力无限的山水风情

    魅力无限的山水风情
    过去要说到贵州来旅游，谁听了也都会摇头。贵州历来只被看作“流放”的不毛之地，“天无三日晴，地无三里平”……
    近些年情况变了。“公园省”、“喀斯特国家公园”等美称加到了贵州头上。
    从前的贵州，以两样东西闻名：茅台酒和黄果树瀑布。然而在解放前及至解放后的一段时间，黄果树瀑布也仅作为“南荒”一“隐”自然地存在于那个地方。真正把它作为旅游开发是党的十一届三中全会以后的事。人们把旅游点称作对外开放的窗口，作为贵州第一个国家级风景名胜区的黄果树，就是贵州最早对外开放的窗口。这个窗口打开了。为了丰富它，和它配上套，才相继有安顺龙宫、清镇红枫湖、织金洞的开发利用，逐步形成一条旅游路线，在贵州通称西线。
    西线实际可行了，人们自然就要想到东线北线南线的事情。贵州东西南北中都有独特的旅游资源，在比较中，西线的喀斯特自然风光，东线的民族风情，北线的历史遗迹（遵义、娄山关、赤水河）就凸现出来了。短短几年中，贵州的国家级风景名胜区从一个增加到五个，省级风景名胜区以数十计。旅游设施也发展起来，各级旅游局、旅行社相继建立。贵州的旅游事业就这样从一个窗口发展到一条路线，从一条路线发展到若干条路线，继而形成有相当规模的一条战线。
    贵州旅游最为独特的是大瀑布、大溶洞和民族风情。大瀑布首推黄果树瀑布和瀑布群，其次是黔北赤水河支流上的十丈洞瀑布和瀑布群。大溶洞以旱洞织金洞、水洞龙宫和黄果树水帘洞为代表，集中在西线。民族风情是东线的主要特色，但其他旅游路线也甚为丰富。而且大瀑布、大溶洞和民族风情三者是互相结合的，黄果树瀑布地区有水帘洞、天星洞、者斗洞，龙宫有龙门瀑布，红枫湖有打鱼洞、将军洞，?阳河也有溶洞和瀑布。而几乎所有的风景名胜区都是少数民族聚居区，黄果树周围的布依族、苗族，织金洞周围的苗族、仡佬族，龙宫周围的布依族，红枫湖和?阳河畔的苗族。遵义是酒乡，赤水河是飘荡着酒香的河，以茅台酒、董酒、习水大曲、珍酒、鸭溪窖酒、湄窖酒等组成的酒文化，又何尝不是一项珍贵的旅游资源？
    贵州的山水魅力无限，贵州的美酒魅力无限，贵州的民族风情魅力无限。贵州这块旅游处女地是令人向往的。
