Recently, American news agencies have reported that Chinese-American scientist Dr. Mao Hongguang and his colleagues have successfully developed metallic hydrogen, describing it as a "major breakthrough" in the field of ultra-high pressure research.

Hydrogen is a gas at room temperature. As pressure increases, gaseous hydrogen can gradually transform into liquid hydrogen and then solid hydrogen. However, obtaining solid hydrogen on Earth is extremely difficult, and producing metallic hydrogen through experimental methods is even more challenging.

After more than a decade of ultra-high pressure research, Mao Hongguang discovered that when the pressure on hydrogen is increased to 280 million atmospheres (equivalent to the pressure at the Earth's core), it is possible to observe through a diamond window as gaseous hydrogen transforms into liquid hydrogen, and then into transparent solid hydrogen. With further pressure, it gradually turns brown and eventually becomes opaque metallic hydrogen.

It is reported that this achievement is the first of its kind in the world. It not only has immense theoretical significance, providing a solid scientific basis for studying the internal structure of planets and exploring the mysteries of the universe's development, but also, due to the ultra-high density and superconducting properties of metallic hydrogen, has great economic value in nuclear fusion, atomic energy utilization, rocket fuel transportation, and the development of room-temperature superconducting materials.

Mao Hongguang graduated from Taiwan University in 1964 and later went to the United States, where he obtained a Ph.D. in geophysics. He has visited mainland China multiple times to give lectures and has shown great concern for China's scientific endeavors.

    美籍华裔科学家
    研制成功金属氢
    最近，美国新闻机构纷纷报道美籍华裔科学家毛河光博士与其同事研制金属氢取得成功，并称之为在超高压研究方面的“重大突破”。
    氢在常温下是一种气体，随着压力增加，气体氢可以逐步变成液态氢、固体氢，但要在地球上获得固体氢是十分困难的，而用实验方法制取金属氢更是难上加难。
    毛河光经过十多年的超高压研究发现，将氢的压力加到二百八十万个大气压（相当于地球内核的压力）时，可透过金刚石窗口观察到气态氢变成液态氢，进而变成透明的固体氢，如继续增压，又逐步变成棕褐色，最后变成不透明的金属氢。
    据称，这一成就在世界上尚属首次。它不仅在理论上有巨大的科学意义，为研究行星内部结构、探索宇宙发展奥秘提供了坚实的科学依据，而且由于金属氢的超高密度和超导性能，在核聚变、原子能利用、火箭燃料输送、常温超导材料的开发等方面有很大的经济价值。
    毛河光一九六四年毕业于台湾大学，后去美国，获地球物理学博士学位。他曾多次来祖国大陆讲学，十分关心中国的科学事业。
