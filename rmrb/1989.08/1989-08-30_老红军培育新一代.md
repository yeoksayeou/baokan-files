78-year-old Chen Chunlin, former deputy political commissar of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region, joined the revolution in 1932. He and General Gan Zuchang, who returned to civilian life as a farmer, are fellow countrymen. Together, they went from Jinggangshan to Yan'an, fought in the Nanmuxuan, and marched into the northwest. In 1975, they returned to Lianhua County, Fanglou Township, Shengbei Village, and together built their hometown.

Chen Chunlin often says, "We are old Red Army soldiers from Jinggangshan. Our responsibility is to care for the future of our country and to be responsible for the next generation." He has served as an off-campus counselor for several primary and secondary schools, teaching and guiding young people, and using history to educate them. The cultural life in Fanglou Township is impoverished, and some young people have fallen into the old habit of gambling. He donated 300 yuan to help the township set up an amateur drama troupe for farmers, writing and performing programs that reflect the new people, new things, and new customs of the countryside, touring the county, and giving young people a place for leisure and entertainment activities, fully developing their hobbies. In 1987, when the country was solemnly commemorating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Base, he suggested to the county committee to seize this opportunity to conduct revolutionary tradition education for the new generation. At that time, it was the height of summer. Chen Chunlin wore a straw hat every day, traveled despite his illness, and gave speeches everywhere, talking about traditions. For more than ten days, the old man went out early and returned late, giving a total of 26 speeches, with an audience of 5,000 people.

"Is it hard? Think of the 25,000 Red Army soldiers; are you tired? Compare it with the revolutionary elders." This has become the common voice of the old Red Army soldiers and the younger generation under Jinggangshan. Chen Chunlin poured all his loyalty to the Party into his love for the younger generation. In 1987 and 1988, he was consecutively named an outstanding retired cadre of the Nanjing Military Region.

    老红军培育新一代
    78岁的原新疆军区南疆军区副政委陈春林，1932年参加革命。他和解甲归田当农民的甘祖昌将军是同乡，两人一起从井冈山到延安，一起奋战南泥湾，进军大西北。1975年回到莲花县坊楼乡沿背村，他俩又一道共建家乡。
    陈春林经常说，我们是井冈山下的红军老战士，我们的责任就是要为祖国的明天操心，为下一代负责。他担任好几所中小学的校外辅导员，向青少年言传身教，以史育人。升坊乡农村业余文化生活贫乏，有的青年染上了赌博旧习，他便捐赠300元，帮助乡里办起了农民业余剧团，自编自演反映农村新人新事新风尚的节目，到全县巡回演出，使青年有了业余文娱活动场所，业余爱好得到充分发挥。1987年，正当全国隆重纪念井冈山革命根据地创建60周年的时候，他又向县委建议，抓住这一时机，向新一代人进行革命传统教育。当时正值酷暑，陈春林每天头戴草帽，带病赶路，到处作报告，讲传统。一连十多天，陈老早出晚归，一共作了26场报告，听众达5000人。
    “苦不苦，想想红军两万五；累不累，比比革命老一辈。”这成了井冈山下老红军战士和青少年两代人的共同心声。陈春林把对党的忠诚全部倾注在对青少年一代的情与爱上。1987年和1988年，他连续两年被评为南京军区优秀离休干部。　　　　（仁远　茂秋　水根）
