Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 9th.

The Air Force has invested 5 million yuan to build a medium-sized raw material production base in Shanghai—the Shanghai Aviation Mechanical and Instrument Equipment Repair Factory—which recently began operations. This is an attempt by the Air Force to use surplus agricultural products, specifically corn, to produce an industrially scarce raw material, "sorbitol."

This factory produces 4,000 tons of "sorbitol" annually, which not only meets the Air Force's demand for aviation cleaning agent raw materials but also supports local industries. Toothpaste made using "sorbitol" from this factory, such as the "Mega Plus" brand, is highly favored by foreign customers.

    空军在沪建原料生产厂
    本报上海8月9日电　空军投资500万元在上海兴建的中型原料生产基地——空军上海航空机械仪器设备修理厂日前投产。这是空军利用富余农产品玉米加工市场紧缺工业原料——“山梨醇”的尝试。这个厂年产“山梨醇”4000吨，不仅可以满足空军航空清洗剂原料的需求，而且支援了地方。采用该厂“山梨醇”制成的美加净牙膏，很受外商欢迎。
