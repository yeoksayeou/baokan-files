Philippines Prepares to Notify the U.S. Not to Renew Military Base Lease

New China News Agency, Manila, August 15th - Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus announced today that the Philippine government will officially notify the United States that the lease agreements for the two major U.S. military bases in the Philippines will not be renewed after they expire in September 1991.

However, Manglapus added that the Philippine government will notify the U.S. of this decision in September of next year.

According to the agreement between the two countries, if the lease is not renewed, one party must notify the other party one year in advance; otherwise, the lease will be automatically renewed.

Philippine Senator Orlando Mercado proposed on the 14th that the Philippines should immediately notify the U.S. to avoid automatic renewal of the lease.

Manglapus said that the National Security Council meeting held last week deemed it necessary to notify the U.S. in advance, but did not decide to do so immediately.

Philippine President Corazon Aquino had earlier announced that the two governments will hold talks on the base issue after 1991 this December.

	August 15th, fifteen prisoners in Davao City, Philippines, took sixteen hostages in an attempt to escape from prison. In the exchange of fire with the police, all fifteen prisoners were killed, and six hostages also died.

    菲律宾准备通知美国不延长军事基地租约
    新华社马尼拉8月15日电　菲律宾外交部长曼格拉普斯今天宣布，菲律宾政府将正式通知美国，美驻菲两大军事基地的租约到1991年9月期满后不再延期。
    但是，曼格拉普斯又说，菲政府将在明年9月通知美国这一决定。
    根据两国协议，租约期满后如不再延长，一方须提前一年向另一方提出通报，否则租约自动延长。
    菲律宾参议员奥尔兰多·梅尔卡多14日提出，菲应立即向美发出通报，以免使租约自动延长。
    曼格拉普斯说，国家安全委员会于上星期举行的会议认为有必要提前通知美国，但未决定现在马上这样做。
    菲律宾总统科·阿基诺早些时候曾宣布，两国政府将于今年12月就1991年后基地问题举行会谈。
