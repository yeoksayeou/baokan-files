Most Beijing university graduates have been successfully assigned to jobs. The number of those going to work in the grassroots has significantly increased.

A reporter learned today from relevant departments that the job assignment work for graduates of Beijing's universities has basically concluded. The vast majority of graduates have been assigned jobs.

This year, Beijing has 80 universities with over 32,000 graduates, including 8,363 graduate students. Excluding 214 undergraduate graduates who have been admitted to graduate programs and over 1,000 who have not yet been assigned to units and are awaiting assignment, the rest have completed their departure procedures. This year, the vast majority of employing units have accepted graduates as planned, with only a few units returning graduates.

Among this year's Beijing university graduates, the number going to work in the grassroots has significantly increased, and the number going to work in township enterprises has also increased compared to last year.

    到基层工作的人数明显增多
    新华社北京8月1日电  （记者张宝瑞）记者今天从有关部门获悉，北京高校毕业生分配工作已基本结束，绝大多数毕业生已分配工作。
    今年北京地区共有80所大学的3.2万多名毕业生，其中研究生8363人，除214名本科毕业生考取研究生及1000多人未落实单位待分配外，其余学生已办理离校手续。今年绝大多数用人单位按计划接收了毕业生，只出现少数用人单位退毕业生的现象。
    这届北京高校毕业生中，到基层工作的明显增多，到乡镇企业工作的也比去年增加。
