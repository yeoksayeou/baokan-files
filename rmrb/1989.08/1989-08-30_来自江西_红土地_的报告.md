Title: Report from Jiangxi's "Red Soil"

Since the founding of the People's Republic, the people of Jiangxi have toiled for 40 years on the "red soil" stained with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, tremendous changes have taken place here, and everything is thriving.

Not long ago, in the face of the tide of reform and opening up, people had various opinions about this piece of "red soil." The term "revolutionary old base area," which was once highly respected, seemed to have become synonymous with poverty, backwardness, and isolation. However, the people of Jiangxi deeply understand the value of the "red soil." As the provincial party secretary Mao Zhiyong said: Jiangxi benefits from "abundant resources" and is aided by "talented people and a blessed land." It is a place with great potential, great achievements, and great hope. The people of Jiangxi have enthusiastically risen up, carrying forward the fine tradition of hard work, and thrown themselves into the torrent of reform and opening up. They have hoisted their sails in the ocean of commodity economy and shown their prowess.

It is hard to imagine the hard work of the people of Jiangxi without seeing it for oneself. Go to Xingguo and see for yourself: once, water and soil erosion and desertification of hills were rampant, and people exclaimed, "Xingguo is going to be 'destroyed'!" To change the harsh ecological environment, the people of Xingguo wielded hoes and pickaxes, carried soil up the mountains, and implemented a combination of engineering measures and biological measures for comprehensive treatment. Each acre treated required over 30 man-days of labor, with only 5 yuan in subsidies, not enough to compensate for the wear and tear of tools. But they worked year after year without complaint. In this way, the forest coverage rate of mountainous areas increased from 10% a decade ago to over 30%. They exchanged their hard work for lush greenery and blessed their descendants. This spirit of sacrifice and dedication is in no way inferior to that of the war years!

More commendable is that the people of Jiangxi adhere to the "one center, two basic points," both carrying forward the spirit of hard work and adhering to the concept of commodity economy, giving new connotations to old traditions. They are "more daring in activating the economy internally and more daring in opening up externally," "liberating thoughts, opening doors, mutual benefit, and even letting go of benefits," with a strong consciousness of reform and opening up, sweeping away the past self-sufficiency, closed, and backward small peasant mentality; "promoting development through reform and opening up through opening up," "the economic edifice of Jiangxi must be built on the foundation of agriculture," "launching a comprehensive war of agricultural development, promoting agricultural industrialization," showing a clear strategic awareness and a pragmatic spirit of starting from the provincial situation and working hard.

Thus, the mountain people who have lived in the mountains for generations, entertaining themselves with the folk song "white rice, red charcoal fire, even gods envy me," are now opening their mountain fortresses to see the great world of commodity economy. The once-famous Five Hundred Li of Jinggangshan for its armed struggle of workers and peasants is now not only welcoming domestic and foreign guests with a ten-li stretch of rhododendrons but also setting up joint ventures with overseas partners. People's feelings for the land are no longer the affectionate attachment of "seeking sustenance" but the cherishing of "seeking benefits." The surplus labor force is continuously transferred from the limited arable land, either rushing to the secondary and tertiary industries or marching towards barren mountains, barren slopes, grasslands, and water bodies, with a momentum even more magnificent than the "Ten Million Workers and Peasants Down to Jian."

Thus, the "South Gate and North Port" of Jiangxi are all open. The old revolutionary base in southern Jiangxi faces Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan and has become an experimental zone for reform. Northern Jiangxi's Jiujiang, with the help of the Yangtze River's golden waterway, has begun large-scale port construction. The implementation of various attractive preferential policies, along with the development of energy, transportation, and communication infrastructure, has improved the investment environment in the province, and a full-scale opening-up pattern has been formed.

Thus, on the battlefield where the Red Army once galloped, the people of Jiangxi are again spurring their horses and chasing one target of poverty alleviation and prosperity after another. Ten years of struggle have won ten major economic indicators, including national income, agricultural and industrial output value, and fiscal revenue, more than doubling compared to ten years ago. A large number of rich counties, rich towns, rich villages, rich factories, and rich households have emerged like mushrooms after rain.

The "red soil" is full of vitality and radiance!

The people of Jiangxi have not stopped; they are continuing to forge ahead!

"Looking back at the past, pointing to the future, the heroes of the Red Army will be remembered for a thousand autumns. It can be said that better chapters are yet to come." This is a poem written by Shao Shiping, the first chairman of the Fujian-Jiangxi Soviet and the first governor of Jiangxi after the founding of the People's Republic, in 1961.

"Your greatest advantage is the revolutionary spirit, the fine tradition. Inheriting and carrying forward this spirit and tradition, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome." This is the advice given by Comrade Peng Zhen during his inspection of Jiangxi in 1987.

Today, the report from the "red soil" comforts people. The revolutionary spirit and fine tradition have surged in the blood of 36 million people in Jiangxi, turning into a great material force. Under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the descendants of the Red Army heroes will surely write more and better chapters.

### 来自江西“红土地”的报告

    来自江西“红土地”的报告
    建国以来，江西人民在无数革命先烈用鲜血染红的“红土地”上，辛勤耕耘了40年。特别是党的十一届三中全会之后，这里到处发生巨变，一派欣欣向荣。
    曾几何时，面对改革开放的大潮，人们对这块“红土地”说长论短，有过种种评说。“革命老区”这个很受人尊敬的字眼，一时似乎变成了贫困、落后、封闭的代名词。然而，江西人民却深知“红土地”的价值，正如省委书记毛致用所说：江西受惠于“物华天宝”，得助于“人杰地灵”，是大有潜力之地，大有作为之地，大有希望之地。江西人民踊跃奋起，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，投入改革开放的洪流，在商品经济的海洋里扬起风帆，一显身手。
    不亲临其境，很难想象出江西老表是怎样艰苦奋斗的。到兴国去看一看吧：从前这里水土流失，山丘沙化，人们惊呼“兴国将要‘亡国’”！为了改变险恶的生态环境，兴国人民挥锄抡镐，挑土上山，实行工程措施和生物措施相结合，进行综合治理。每治一亩花工30多个，仅有5元钱补助费，还不够补偿工具的损耗。但他们年复一年，毫无怨言。就这样，山地植被覆盖率由10年前的10％增加到30％以上。他们用辛勤的汗水，换来葱茏黛绿，福荫子孙。这种牺牲与奉献精神，与战争年代相比毫不逊色！
    更值得称道的是，江西人民坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”，既发扬艰苦奋斗精神，又坚持商品经济观念，赋予老传统以新内涵。他们“对内更大胆地搞活，对外更大胆地开放”，“解放思想，门户开放，互惠互利，甚至让利”，以很强的改革开放意识震撼着“红土地”，一扫过去自给自足、封闭落后的小农观念；“以改革促发展，以开放促开发”，“江西的经济大厦一定要建筑在农业这个基础上”，“打一场农业开发总体战，推进农业——工业化”，显示了明确的战略意识和从省情出发、脚踏实地的实干精神。
    于是，世世代代久蛰山中，以“白米饭、红炭火，神仙不如我”的歌谣自娱其乐的山里人，如今纷纷“打开山寨门，见商品经济大世面”。当年以工农武装割据而闻名遐迩的五百里井冈，现在不仅以绵延十里的杜鹃迎来了国内外客人，还与海外办起了合资企业。人们对土地的感情，已不再是“求温饱”式的眷恋，而是“求效益”式的珍惜。剩余劳力则从有限的耕地上络绎不绝地转移出来，或奔向二、三产业，或向荒山、荒坡、草洲、水域进军，其声势比当年“十万工农下吉安”更加壮观。
    于是，江西的“南门北港”一齐敞开了。赣南老区面向闽粤琼成了改革试验区，赣北九江借助长江黄金水道开始了规模宏大的港口建设。各种具有吸引力的优惠政策的实施，加上能源、交通、通讯等基础设施的发展，使全省投资环境有了改善，全方位开放格局已经形成。
    于是，在当年红军战士驰骋的战场上，江西人民又催马扬鞭，追逐着脱贫致富的一个又一个目标。十年奋斗，赢得了国民生产总值、国民收入、工农业总产值、财政收入等十项主要经济指标比十年前翻一番以上。一大批富县、富乡、富村、富厂、富户，如雨后春笋般地冒了出来。
    “红土地”生机勃勃，流金溢彩！
    江西人民没有止步，正在继续奋力向前！
    “漫话当年，指点远处，红军英雄千万秋。可断言，更好文章，还在后头。”这是当年闽赣省苏维埃主席、建国后江西省第一任省长邵式平1961年写下的词章。
    “你们最大的优势是革命精神，是优良传统。发扬和继承这个精神和传统，就没有克服不了的困难。”这是彭真同志1987年视察江西时的告诫。
    今天，来自“红土地”的报告告慰着人们，革命精神和优良传统已在3600万江西人民的热血中涌流，化为巨大的物质力量。在党的十三届四中全会精神指引下，红军英雄的后代必将谱写更多更好的篇章。
