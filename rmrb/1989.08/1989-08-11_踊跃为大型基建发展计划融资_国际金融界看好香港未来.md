International financial circles have recently shown keen interest in funding several major infrastructure development projects in Hong Kong, demonstrating their confidence in the future of the Hong Kong economy.

The largest infrastructure project loan in Hong Kong—HK$10.5 billion for the Hong Kong International Container Terminal—was successfully arranged on August 6. Major international banks such as HSBC, Bank of China, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and Mitsubishi Bank participated in the financing. According to the arranging institution, the total amount applied for by the syndicate exceeded the original HK$10.5 billion, reaching HK$13 billion. Therefore, some syndicate members could only be allocated less than their applied loan amount. This shows the strong interest of the international banking community in Hong Kong's major infrastructure projects. A syndicate led by the American Bank of Commerce also arranged a long-term loan of HK$3.3 billion for the Eagle Star Group's development project at Garden Road in Hong Kong's Central District. In addition to these two loan arrangements, there is a HK$2 billion syndicated loan organized by the Japanese Kaden Development for the acquisition of a 50% stake in the Bank of China Tower; and the joint venture of Sun Hung Kai Properties and Kajima Corporation also arranged a syndicated loan totaling HK$1 billion for the transaction of the Jardine House property.

Furthermore, more than 10 foreign banks have been approved by the Hong Kong government to establish branches here this year. Local analysts believe this is another indication of the international financial community's confidence in Hong Kong's future.

    踊跃为大型基建发展计划融资
    国际金融界看好香港未来
    新华社香港8月11日电　（记者姚达添）国际金融界最近接二连三对此间几项大型基建发展计划踊跃融资，显示了他们对未来的香港经济具有信心。
    香港最大宗基建项目贷款——105亿港元的香港国际货柜码头融资，已于6日顺利筹组完成。汇丰银行、中国银行、加拿大怡东融资有限公司及三菱银行等十家世界著名银行参与了融资。据筹组贷款的负责机构透露，由于银团所申请认购的总金额超过原定的105亿港元，达130亿港元，故部分银团成员只能获准认购低于其申请的贷款额。国际银团对此间大宗基建项目的兴趣由此可见一斑。以美资万国宝通银行为首的一个银团也在安排一项高达33亿港元的长期贷款，为鹰君集团在香港中区花园道地王发展计划。除上述两宗贷款安排外，还有由日资高日发展所筹组的20亿港元银团贷款，作为购入奔达中心五成权益之用；联合地产及鹿岛集团，也在随后为地利根德阁物业的交易，筹组共达10亿港元的银团贷款。
    此外，今年有10多家外资银行已获港府批准在这里设立分行。此间分析家认为，这也是国际金融界对香港未来充满信心的表现。
