The Soviet Union will do everything possible to promote Afghan national reconciliation and let the Afghan people decide their own fate, a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry said here August 7.

The statement was a response to a special statement by UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on the Afghan issue. The Soviet Union expressed its agreement with the Secretary-General's emphasis on the need for dialogue among Afghans to form a government on a broad basis.

The current situation in Afghanistan is tense due to the escalation of the civil war. The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman called for the observance of the agreements signed in Geneva in April 1988. The spokesman denied Western news agency reports that 1,500 Soviet soldiers had arrived in Kabul. He reiterated that since the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops on February 15 this year, there are no Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement August 7 on the rocket attack on the Soviet Embassy in Afghanistan, saying that the Soviet Union could not remain indifferent to the incident.

According to TASS, the Soviet Embassy in Kabul was hit by a missile on August 7, with two more falling near the embassy.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry statement said that such attacks were not the first of their kind, and the Soviet Union expressed indignation, warning that the perpetrators would bear full responsibility.
