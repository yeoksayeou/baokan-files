Brazil and Argentina yesterday signed a series of new agreements in Brasília on the development of nuclear energy, the peaceful use of outer space, and further strengthening of economic, trade, and cultural cooperation between the two countries. They also exchanged documents for the integration treaty between the two nations. Argentine President Carlos Menem and Brazilian President José Sarney both spoke at the signing and document exchange ceremony, emphasizing that the integration of the two countries has entered a new stage of development. This is of great significance for overcoming economic difficulties and promoting the overall integration of Latin America.

President Menem arrived in Brazil on August 22nd. During his stay in Brasília, he told the press: "Achieving integration is a long-term decision and aspiration of the governments and peoples of both countries. It is not a temporary measure and will not be affected by changes in governments or presidential elections." Menem stated that the new Argentine government will continue to implement the integration agreements signed with Brazil during the previous Alfonsín administration. He also believes that as the integration of Argentina and Brazil is consolidated and developed, other Latin American countries will join this process, and the overall integration of Latin America can be expected to be realized by the year 2000.

President Sarney also mentioned in his speech that the integration path taken by Brazil and Argentina is "unshakable." Past mistrust and disputes have been replaced by friendly cooperation. Menem's first visit to Brazil marks the consolidation and development of integration and cooperation between the two countries.

The integration treaty between Brazil and Argentina was reached in 1986. Uruguay, located between the two countries, subsequently joined this regional integration plan. The three countries are currently working towards establishing a common market.

    巴阿签署新合作协定
    本报巴西利亚8月24日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西和阿根廷昨天在这里签署了关于发展核能源、和平利用外层空间以及进一步加强两国经贸和文化合作的一系列新协定，并举行了两国一体化条约的换文仪式。阿根廷总统梅内姆和巴西总统萨尔内在签约和换文仪式上讲话一致指出，两国一体化已进入新的发展阶段，这对于克服经济困难、推动整个拉美一体化的发展有着重大意义。
    梅内姆总统是在22日抵达巴西访问的，他在巴西利亚期间向新闻界发表讲话强调：“实现一体化是两国政府和人民的长期决心和愿望，它不是权宜之计，也不受各国政权更迭和总统换届的影响”。梅内姆表示，阿新政府将继续执行上届阿方辛政府时期与巴西签订的有关一体化的协议，他还认为，随着阿巴两国一体化的巩固和发展，其它拉美国家也将加入这一进程，整个拉美一体化可望在2000年内得到实现。
    巴西总统萨尔内也在讲话中指出，巴西和阿根廷所走的一体化道路是“不可动摇的”，过去的不信任和争执已为友好合作所代替，梅内姆首次访问巴西标志着两国的一体化和合作得到了巩固和发展。
    巴西和阿根廷两国一体化条约是在1986年达成的，位于两国之间的乌拉圭也随后加入了这个区域的一体化计划，目前三国正在为建立共同市场而努力。
