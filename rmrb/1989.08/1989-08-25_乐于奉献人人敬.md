The article "A Communist Party Member Who Is Willing to Devote Herself" vividly describes the touching deeds of Communist Party member Yu Chenghua, who is dedicated to serving the people and caring for the masses. It reflects the spiritual image of today's Communist Party members. It should be noted that there are many such advanced individuals within our party, but unfortunately, we have not done enough to promote, commend, and support these exemplary figures.

It is undeniable that over a period of time, due to the relaxation of ideological and political work and the lack of ideological education for party members, some party members have indeed shown a decline in their ideological standards. Under the impact of bourgeois liberalization and various unhealthy trends, it seems that selfless devotion and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people have become outdated. The reason why Yu Chenghua's deeds are so touching is that she remains unwavering in the face of various unhealthy trends, strictly adheres to the standards of a Communist Party member, correctly handles issues related to career, family, money, and more, and maintains the honorable qualities of a Communist Party member. This is truly admirable. We hope that all party members, especially party cadres, will take a look at Yu Chenghua's deeds, reflect on their own thoughts over the past few years, and draw lessons from them. Doing so will help in firmly establishing the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people and consciously fulfilling the responsibilities of a party member.

Promoting advanced individuals is one of our excellent traditions in propaganda work. The deeds of advanced individuals such as Lei Feng, Jiao Yulu, Wang Jinxi, Jiang Zuying, and Zhang Binggui have become household names through propaganda and education, inspiring several generations. These propagandas have spread communist ideology and promoted the construction of spiritual civilization. We must carry forward this good tradition, correct the tendency of not being enthusiastic enough about promoting advanced individuals, and boldly and enthusiastically sing the praises of those who possess noble thoughts and have made outstanding contributions to reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations.

### 乐于奉献人人敬

    乐于奉献人人敬
    《乐于奉献的共产党员》一文，以满含深情的笔触，记述了共产党员于嫦华廉洁奉公、关心群众、全心全意为人民服务的感人事迹，生动地反映了当今共产党员的精神风貌。应该看到，我们党内像于嫦华这样的共产党员是很多的，可惜我们对这些先进人物的宣扬、褒奖、支持太不够了。
    不可否认，一段时间以来，由于放松了思想政治工作，放松了对党员的思想教育，有些党员思想上确实出现了退坡。在资产阶级自由化思潮和种种不健康的思潮冲击下，好像无私奉献、全心全意为人民服务等等高尚品德和情操不合时宜了。于嫦华的事迹之所以感人，就是因为她在种种不健康的思潮面前，不为所惑，用共产党员的标准严格要求自己，正确处理事业、家庭、金钱等等问题，保持了一个共产党员的光荣本色。这是很值得敬佩的。我们希望广大党员首先是党员干部看一看于嫦华的事迹，结合自己这几年的思想实际，认真作一番思考，从中引出经验教训。这样做，有助于牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，自觉地履行党员的责任。
    大力宣传先进人物，是我们宣传工作的优良传统之一。雷锋、焦裕禄、王进喜、蒋筑英、张秉贵等一大批先进人物及其光辉事迹，就是通过宣传教育而家喻户晓、鼓舞了几代人的。这些宣传，传播了共产主义思想，推动了精神文明建设。我们要发扬这个好传统，纠正对宣传先进人物不够热心的倾向，理直气壮、满腔热忱地讴歌那些具有高尚思想情操、为改革开放和四化建设作出突出贡献的先进人物。
