Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, Liao Hansheng, said today that there are no fundamental conflicts of interest between China and Thailand, only understanding, friendship, and cooperation.

Liao Hansheng hosted and dined with a delegation from the Military Committee of the House of Representatives of the Kingdom of Thailand, led by Chairman Admiral Sirichai Sirilankas, at the Great Hall of the People this evening. He expressed gratitude to the Thai government for supporting and understanding the measures China took to quell the riot. He said that soon after China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Chairman Sirichai led the delegation to visit China, which fully demonstrated the Thai side's enthusiasm and importance in consolidating and developing Sino-Thai relations.

Sirichai said that Prime Minister Chatchai had instructed him to convey to the Chinese side that the Thai government believed the Chinese government had the full capability to control and stabilize the situation. China's measures to quell the riot were necessary. This is China's internal affair, and other countries should not interfere. He said that Thailand's policy towards China's diplomatic, economic, and cultural exchanges remains unchanged.

This afternoon, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, Zeng Tao, held talks with Sirichai.

    廖汉生会见泰国客人
    据新华社北京8月25日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、全国人大外事委员会主任委员廖汉生今天在这里说，中泰两国间没有根本的利害冲突，有的只是理解、友谊和合作。
    廖汉生今晚在人民大会堂会见并宴请由主席西里·西里朗西海军上将率领的泰王国国会下议院军事委员会代表团。他感谢泰国政府支持和理解中国在平息暴乱中所采取的措施。他说，在中国平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱之后不久，西里主席就率团访华，这充分说明泰方对巩固和发展中泰关系的热忱和重视。
    西里说，差猜总理让他告诉中国方面，泰国政府认为中国政府有充分能力控制和稳定局势。中国采取平暴措施是必要的。这是中国的内政，别国不应干涉。他说，泰国对中国的外交、经济、文化交流方面的政策不变。
    今天下午，全国人大常委会委员、全国人大外事委员会副主任委员曾涛同西里举行了会谈。
