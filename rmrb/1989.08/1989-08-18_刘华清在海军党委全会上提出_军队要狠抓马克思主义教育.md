Central Military Commission Vice Secretary Liu Huaqing today at the Sixth Plenum of the Sixth Session of the Navy Party Committee proposed that at present, the military must seriously summarize experiences and lessons, strengthen Party leadership, strengthen Party building, strengthen the construction of the Party member and cadre teams, and strengthen political and ideological work. The most important of these is to vigorously promote Marxist education.

Liu Huaqing said that in recent years, some people have been unclear about right and wrong on some major political principles. In the process of reform and opening up, they have relaxed the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. A very important reason for this is that they have neglected the study of Marxist basic theory. We must see that there is a current domestically and internationally that opposes Marxism. Within our Party, Comrade Zhao Ziyang has made mistakes on the issue of opposing bourgeois liberalization. Under his influence, many comrades have had a weakened class struggle consciousness, a weakened consciousness of the Party as the leading core, and a weakened consciousness of relying wholeheartedly on the working class, while individualism has increased. Ultimately, the confusion in thought is confusion in theory. He pointed out that arming our minds with Marxist basic theory is key to learning to use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to observe and analyze problems, to enhance the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and to maintain a firm and correct political direction. Whether they are old cadres or new cadres, they should all strengthen their learning, master a scientific worldview and methodology, and stand firmly in the face of complex political struggles. Especially high-level cadres and high-level leading organs must stand on the Party's standpoint and consider problems from the fundamental interests of the state and the nation.

Liu Huaqing also said that in the face of the stern reality, the entire military, especially high-level cadres, should seriously consider the issue of the functions of the people's army in peacetime. According to Marxist state theory, the army is an important component of the state apparatus. The people's army defends against external aggression, prevents subversion and sabotage by hostile forces internally, ensures social order and political stability, and is a sacred duty entrusted to our army by the constitution. On this point, all comrades in the military should speak out boldly and be good defenders of the republic.

    刘华清在海军党委全会上提出
    军队要狠抓马克思主义教育
    据新华社北京8月18日电　（记者黄彩虹）中央军委副秘书长刘华清今天在海军党委六届六次全会上提出，当前，军队要认真总结经验教训，加强党的领导，加强党的建设，加强党员和干部队伍的建设，加强政治思想工作。其中，最重要的是狠抓马克思主义的教育。
    刘华清说，这些年来，一些人所以在一些重大政治原则问题上是非不清，在改革开放的过程中放松了反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，很重要的原因是忽视了马克思主义基本理论学习。要看到，在国内外有一股反对马克思主义的逆流。在我们党内，赵紫阳同志在反对资产阶级自由化问题上犯了错误。在他的影响下，很多同志的阶级斗争观念淡薄了，党是领导核心的观念淡薄了，全心全意依靠工人阶级的观念淡薄了，而个人主义多了。思想上的种种混乱，谈到底是理论上的混乱。他指出，用马克思主义基本理论武装我们的头脑，关键是要学会用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法去观察分析问题，提高辨别是非的能力，保持坚定正确的政治方向。不论是老干部还是新干部，都应当加强学习，掌握科学的世界观和方法论，在复杂的政治斗争中站稳立场。尤其是高级干部和高级领导机关，一定要站在党的立场上，从国家和民族的根本利益上考虑问题。
    刘华清还说，学习马克思主义，在严峻的现实面前，全军特别是高级干部应当认真思考人民军队在和平时期的职能问题。根据马克思主义的国家学说，军队是国家机器的重要组成部分。人民军队对外抵御侵略，对内防止敌对势力的颠覆破坏，保证社会秩序和政治安定，是宪法赋予我军的神圣职责。对这一点，全军同志都要理直气壮地去讲，当好共和国的卫士。
