Thousands of gray magpies have made their homes on Liu Gong Island, a popular tourist destination. Every morning and evening, these birds gather in groups, flitting and playing among the trees and by the shore.

Liu Gong Island, located at the eastern tip of the Shandong Peninsula, boasts a pleasant climate and a beautiful natural environment, with a forest coverage rate of 95%. Since 1980, the local government and military have been actively engaged in afforestation, planting hundreds of thousands of trees, transforming the island into a "garden in the sea" with flowers in spring, shade in summer, fruits in autumn, and greenery in winter. The island's residents and soldiers have launched a campaign to "maintain ecological balance, attract birds, protect birds, and love birds," successfully drawing a large number of gray magpies to nest here. Upon hearing the news, tourists have flocked to the island to catch a glimpse of this spectacle.

    数千灰喜鹊　安家刘公岛
    新华社济南8月24日电  （通讯员任道金、蒋洪）旅游胜地刘公岛如今又添一景观——6000余只灰喜鹊在这里安家落户，每到清晨和傍晚就成群结队地在林间岸畔追逐、戏闹。
    位于山东半岛东端的刘公岛，气候宜人，自然环境优美，林木覆盖率达95％。自1980年以来，当地政府和驻军抓紧海岛绿化，植树数十万株，使海岛变成春有花、夏有荫、秋有果、冬有青的“海上花园”。岛上军民还开展“维护生态平衡，招鸟、护鸟、爱鸟”活动，招引大批灰喜鹊前来栖息。游人闻此消息，纷纷前往一睹为快。
