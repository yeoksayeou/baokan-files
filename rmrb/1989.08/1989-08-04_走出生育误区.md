Since the advent of written records, China has consistently been the most populous country on Earth. In the year 400 AD, when the world population was 100 million, China's population was 46 million, nearly half of the world's total. Even today, with the world population exceeding 5 billion, China's population still accounts for more than one-fifth of the global total. One would think that by now, Chinese people would deeply feel the burden of overpopulation and unite to implement family planning, aiming to achieve zero population growth, national prosperity, and the well-being of future generations. However, to this day, people still take pride in having many children, remaining poor and backward in their ways: "The poorer you are, the more children you have; the more children you have, the poorer you become." Despite the long-standing implementation of family planning, it remains the "most difficult task in the world"! Often, people disregard regulations and laws to have unauthorized births, even fleeing their homes to evade family planning, ending up with a string of children in confusion. Undoubtedly, they have entered the birth control misconceptions, misleading the country, the people, themselves, and their descendants!

I believe the birth control misconceptions can be summarized as "five heavy, five light."

Misconception one: Preferring sons over daughters. This is the essence of our national culture. "Continuing the family line" is the duty of males. This ancient tradition still cruelly deceives the spirits and bodies of our compatriots. To obtain a "male heir" to carry on the family name, some people abandon social morality, sacrifice their careers, and even commit crimes in their mad pursuit of a son, vowing, "I will not rest until I have a son." Once they have a son, they feel superior, speak louder, walk more confidently, as if they have completed a great achievement in life, how glorious! But what if they fail to have a son? They feel as if they have lost everything, leading to despair. This abnormal mentality strongly disrupts the peaceful and harmonious family and social life.

Misconception two: Preferring the young over the elderly. The love for children is universal. However, the virtue of respecting the elderly has been forgotten by many who have become parents. Love is only directed towards children, while the true meaning of loving children is forgotten. A famous cartoon titled "Waiting" perfectly captures the issue: one scene shows a young mother feeding her child and saying affectionately, "Eat more, grow fast!" The other scene shows the grown child, furious, pointing at the elderly mother and saying, "Eat less, die quickly!" Of course, this is an exaggeration. However, lonely elderly people with many descendants are not uncommon, and many beggars on the streets have unfilial children. Reality shatters the beautiful dream of "many children, many blessings"! Today's young parents seem to be reliving this "dream." They view taking care of the elderly as an extra burden and devote all their energy to having children, but will they also face loneliness and bitterness in their old age? The future is uncertain.

Misconception three: Prioritizing quantity over quality. Nowadays, many parents, especially those in rural areas, focus on the number of children rather than their quality. Parents with many children rarely invest in improving their children's individual qualities, especially their cultural education. First, they themselves lack the ability to improve their children's cultural education; second, even if they have the ability, they often find it challenging to do so. At best, they can only ensure that the "key" child, usually a boy, receives an education, while the girls are pushed into illiteracy. The fact that women make up more than 70% of the illiterate population in rural areas is a clear example. In terms of physical health, they are satisfied with just raising their children to adulthood, without considering whether the children are strong and healthy. They have neither the time nor the ability to think about it.

Misconception four: Prioritizing the family over the nation. China has a large population but limited land, and the burden is heavy. Implementing family planning is a fundamental national policy, which is well-known to every household. However, every year, millions of people have unauthorized births. They prioritize family interests over national interests, using a small-scale producer's private ownership mindset to guide their childbearing. In a situation where the state strictly controls population growth, they feel that having an extra child is like gaining an advantage. Once this desire is fulfilled, they feel deeply satisfied. If someone does not gain this advantage, they feel that their family is at a loss, feeling disappointed and incomplete. Whenever there is an opportunity, or even without one, they will find ways to "compensate" by having unauthorized births. Family planning is indeed difficult—it is the most challenging task in the world! Satisfying a false family interest separated from national interests is indeed foolish. They and their descendants will eventually taste the bitter fruits sown today. In fact, the fundamental interests of national prosperity and personal wealth are the same. Without a prosperous nation, it is difficult for a family to thrive. History has proven that only by implementing family planning can one achieve early prosperity and wealth.

Misconception five: Prioritizing reputation over reality. People say, "Nowadays, people value practical benefits," and some say, "Farmers value practical benefits the most." However, in the matter of childbearing, people seem to have thrown "practical benefits" to the wind. After a lifetime of thrift and raising children, by the time the children are settled, they themselves are already old and frail. Where are the practical benefits? Then, what is it for? Reputation. People sacrifice their high-priced lives to exchange for this illusory and distant "reputation." I once bluntly asked a person with many grandchildren but no one to take care of them in old age what they were seeking. She said, "As long as the reputation is good." How vague, how abstract, and how impractical! Unfortunately, due to the lack of care, she hanged herself last year at the age of eighty. Alas, nothing is more tragic than this!

"Continuing the family line," "preferring sons over daughters," and "many children, many blessings" are these feudal, ignorant, and backward birth control misconceptions, like poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts, harming lives and bringing profound disasters to the country, society, and especially the broad masses of farmers—both in spiritual and material life. To this day, many people still cannot recognize this "birth control misconception" that harms society and families, and even its true form is covered by various false so-called "practical problems"—although some are indeed practical problems. People are driven by "many children, many blessings" and "continuing the family line," not hesitating to pay the high price of family happiness and life joy, creating various human tragedies. I advise those deeply trapped in the misconception to have an awakening, strive to break free from the spiritual shackles, escape the birth control misconceptions, resolutely implement family planning, and pursue the true path to life happiness.

    走出生育误区
    边厚泽
    自有文字记载以来，中国一直是地球上人口最多的国家。公元400年前，当世界1亿人时，我国人口有4600万，占世界总人口近50％。直到今天，世界人口超过50亿时，中国人口仍占世界的1／5强。按说，现在的中国人已深切地感受到人口过多之苦，理应齐心并力实行计划生育，早日使人口达到零增长水平，实现国富民强、造福子孙的目的。然而，时至今日，国人仍以“儿孙满堂”为荣，虽贫穷落后，其性不改：“越穷越生，越生越穷”。国家推行计划生育时日如此长久，还是“天下第一难事”！常常有人乱纪违法抢怀超生，甚至背井离乡，逃避计划生育，糊里糊涂地生下了一串儿女。无疑，他们驶进了生育误区，误国误民误己误后！
    我谓生育误区，大抵为“五重五轻”。
    误区之一：重男轻女。此乃国粹中之国粹。“传宗接代”，非男性莫属。这千年古训，如今还残忍地愚弄着我们同胞的性灵和躯壳。为了得到一个“接户口本的”、“续香火的”，有人竟背弃社会道德，抛弃事业，进而违法犯罪，疯狂地追求男孩，“不生男孩不罢休”。一旦怀抱男孩，便觉高人一头，说话嗓门粗了，走路步子稳了，俨然完成了人生一大伟业，何等荣光！倘若求子不得呢？则如丧考妣，以至万念俱灰。这种畸形心态强烈地冲击着宁静而和谐的家庭与社会生活。
    误区之二：重幼轻长。爱子之心，人皆有之。而尊老敬贤这一中华民族的美德，如今却被许多已作父母的子女们遗忘了。爱的情感只为子女单向倾泄，至于何为真正对子女的爱又茫然莫名。一幅名《盼》的漫画，可谓切中时弊：一个画面是，年轻母亲正喂养幼子并亲切地说：“多吃点儿，快长大！”另一画面则是，幼子已长大，怒发冲冠，手指着白发老母说：“少吃点儿，快死吧！”当然这里用了夸张手法。不过，现时“儿孙满堂”的孤独老人并不少见，许多街头乞讨的老人多有不孝子孙，现实生活把“多子多福”的美梦击得粉碎！今天的年轻父母们似乎在重做这一“美梦”，他们视养老为额外负担而倾全部心血生儿育女，老来是否也会留下孤寂与悲愤？预后实未可卜。
    误区之三：重量轻质。现在不少父母特别是农村的父母们追求孩子数量，而忽视孩子的素质。一些多子女父母很少有为提高孩子的个体素质首先是文化素质下功夫的。一是他们本身就不具备提高孩子文化素质的素质；二是即使具有这种素质也常常力不从心，充其量不过保证“重点”，对男孩子加以培养，而将女孩子推进文盲的行列。农村文盲中，女性占70％以上就是明证。在身体素质上，他们满足于把孩子“拉扯大”，至于孩子是否长得壮实、健康，他们既无暇考虑，也无能考虑。
    误区之四：重家轻国。中国人口多，土地少，负担重，实行计划生育是基本国策，已经家愈户晓。然而每年竟有上千万人计划外生育。他们把家庭利益放在国家利益之上，用一种小生产者的私有观念指导生育。在国家要求严格控制人口增长的情况下，他们觉得多生一个孩子似乎多占一分“便宜”。这种心理一旦得到满足，就感到由衷的欣慰。谁要是没有占取这分“便宜”，便有家里“吃亏”之感，怅然若有所失。一遇机会，或者没有机会，也要千方百计寻求“补偿”而超生。计划生育难矣哉——天下第一！一个脱离国家利益的虚幻的家庭利益得到满足，这当然是一种愚昧。他们和他们的子孙们最终会尝到今日种下的苦果。其实，兴国与发家，其根本利益是一致的。国不兴则家难发。事实证明，只有实行计划生育，才能早日发家致富。
    误区之五：重名轻实。人说“现在的人是讲实惠的”，还有说“农民最讲实惠”。但是在生育问题上，人们似乎把“实惠”抛到九霄云外了。大半辈子省吃俭用，养儿育女，等把儿女们安顿好时，自己已白发苍苍，腰躬背驼了，实惠何在？那么，是为了什么呢？名声。人们以高昂的人生为代价，换取这虚幻而渺茫的“名声”。我曾直言问一位有儿孙数十而老无所养者图的是什么？她说：“只要名声好。”多么朦胧，多么抽象，多不实惠！不幸，因无人赡养，她于去年年届八旬而自缢身亡。悲哉，莫过于斯！
      “传宗接代”、“重男轻女”、“多子多福”，这些封建、愚昧、落后的生育观念，如毒蛇猛兽，戕害生灵，给国家、给社会特别是给广大农民带来深重的灾难——精神生活的和物质生活的。至今不少人还未能识别这危害社会和家庭的
  “生育误区”，甚至其真象被种种虚假的所谓“实际问题”——尽管有些确是实际问题——所掩盖。人们为“多子多福”、
  “传宗接代”所驱使，不惜付出家庭幸福和人生欢乐的昂贵代价，制造出种种人间悲剧来。我劝深陷误区而不能自拔者早有所悟、奋力挣脱精神枷锁，走出生育误区，坚决实行计划生育，追求真正的人生幸福之路。
