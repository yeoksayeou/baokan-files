The artillery research institute of the General Staff Department has, in its efforts to promote clean governance, focused on establishing and perfecting various regulations and rules, ensuring that everything has clear guidelines. This has broken down the mystique surrounding certain issues and increased transparency, making sensitive topics such as overseas trips, promotions, bonus distributions, and housing adjustments more open to public scrutiny. This has made it easier for everyone to monitor these processes. Issues that were once contentious and caused headaches are no longer problematic.

Due to the openness in procedures and results, the enthusiasm of cadres and technical personnel has been greatly stimulated, effectively promoting the institute's efforts in clean governance. Over the past three years, the institute has not had any instances of disciplinary violations, and no party members have been subjected to disciplinary actions. In the past three years, the institute has won awards for 63 scientific research projects.

    炮兵某所加强制度建设
    “两公开”调动了积极性
    本报讯　总参炮兵某研究所在抓廉政建设中，注意健全各类规章制度，做到凡事有章可循，打破了神秘化，增加了公开性，致使一些“热点”、敏感问题，如出国、职级晋升、奖金分配、住房调整等，透明度都比较高，便于大家监督。一些过去最容易引起矛盾“打破头”的事，不再是让人“头痛”的事了。
    由于办事制度和办事结果公开，激发了干部和科技人员的积极性，有力地促进了这个所的廉政建设。近三年来，这个所没有发生任何违纪现象，没有一名党员受党纪处分。三年来，这个所共有63个科研项目获奖。　（张东文　董舟）
