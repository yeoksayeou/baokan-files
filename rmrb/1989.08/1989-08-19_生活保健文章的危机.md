Yang Rupeng wrote in the fifteenth issue of *Qiushi* magazine in 1989 that he enjoys reading articles about health and hygiene. However, he sometimes feels that certain articles seem to be in a crisis, making it difficult for them to correctly guide people in conducting health and hygiene practices in a scientific and rational manner.

Firstly, some articles easily advocate for or reject certain views, leaving people at a loss. Some articles say that aluminum products are harmful to the human body and that iron pots and kettles should be promoted. Later, other articles say that aluminum is not easily absorbed by the human body, and that the trace elements iron needed by the human body cannot be obtained from iron products. As for whether it is good or bad to read while eating, to cook spinach and tofu together, to drink overnight tea, or to walk a hundred steps after a meal, it is a matter of "each to their own."

Secondly, some articles emphasize the content of certain foods, medicines, or products that the human body needs, while ignoring the actual needs and absorption rates of people in different regions and with different health conditions. Without a scientific analysis and synthesis of the complexity of the situation, the effects of consumption or use are difficult to guarantee and may even be contrary to expectations.

Thirdly, some articles detach from national and family conditions, blindly introducing foreign health and hygiene methods. It is said that Westerners do not nap in the afternoon, and a lecturer from Taiwan even claimed that "napping is not good for the heart." However, for Chinese people who work eight hours a day and have relatively lower physical and nutritional levels, if conditions permit, taking a nap in the afternoon is beneficial for both work and health.

Fourthly, some articles fabricate information and deceive readers. The "wave therapy" and drinking red tea yeast for health have been quite popular for a while, but they have long since disappeared. However, advertisements for "human height increase" and "eternal youth," as well as news, interviews, and articles with strong advertising tones, still occupy a place in various publications.

### 生活保健文章的危机

    生活保健文章的危机
    杨如鹏在一九八九年第十五期《求是》杂志上撰文说，我爱读介绍生活保健知识的文章。但有时也感觉，某些文章似乎陷入了危机，难以正确引导人们科学合理地进行生活保健。
    其一，轻易提倡或否定某种见解，使人无所适从。有文章说，铝制品对人体有害，应提倡使用铁锅、铁壶等铁制品。后来，又有文章说，铝不易被人体吸收，人体需要的微量元素铁也不能从铁制品中得到。至于边吃饭边看书报、菠菜与豆腐同烧、喝隔夜茶、“饭后百步走”等等是好还是不好，也是“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”。
    其二，单纯强调某种食物、药物或用品含有多少人体需要的成份，而忽视不同地区、不同健康状况的人的实际需求量和吸收量。对情况的复杂性缺乏科学的分析和综合，服用或使用的效果就很难保证，甚至难免事与愿违。
    其三，脱离国情家情，盲目引进外国生活保健方式。据说西方人是不午睡的，台湾一位讲师还发表了“午睡对心脏不利”的高论。但对于一天工作八小时、体质和营养水平尚不高的中国人来说，只要有条件，中午打个盹儿对工作、对身体都有裨益。
    其四，弄虚作假，糊弄读者。甩手疗法、喝红茶菌等健身“妙法”着实热闹过一阵子，如今早已烟消云散。但至今“人体增高”、“青春长驻”之类的广告和广告色彩甚浓的新闻、专访、文章仍在各种出版物中堂而皇之地占据一席之地。
