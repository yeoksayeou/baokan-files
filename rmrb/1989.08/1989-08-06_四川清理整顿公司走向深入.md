The Sichuan Provincial Committee decided at a recent meeting of the expanded Standing Committee that leading organs should take the lead in dissolving the labor service companies established by the offices of several major provincial committees and several large companies run by provincial organs. Strict actions will be taken to investigate and punish companies that have violated laws and regulations.

Since last September, Sichuan's work on rectifying and cleaning up companies has achieved notable results. The number of various companies (centers) has been clarified; the issue of party and government cadres holding concurrent business positions has been basically resolved; most companies that blurred the distinction between government and enterprise have been decoupled; and a number of companies that violated laws and regulations have been investigated and punished.

    四川清理整顿公司走向深入
    本报成都八月六日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省委在日前召开的常委扩大会议上决定，领导机关带头，撤销省级几大班子办公厅各自兴办的劳动服务公司和省级机关办的几大公司，对违纪违法的公司抓紧查处。
    自去年九月以来，四川清理整顿公司工作已收到显著成效。各类公司（中心）的底数已经清楚；党政干部兼职经商的问题基本解决；政企不分的公司绝大多数已脱钩；查处了一批公司违纪违法案件。
