On July 22, over 200 pilgrims from Shaoyang City, Hunan Province, gathered in various temples within the city to burn "departure incense" in preparation for their pilgrimage to Mount Heng the following day. Among the long line of worshippers, five or six children aged 6 to 12 stood out, drawing particular attention. Dressed similarly to the adults—wearing green shirts, green pants, and green head coverings, with red "embrace-belts" around their waists—some of them even held incense stands and could perform the various rituals and chants as proficiently as the adults. Seeing this scene, one cannot help but feel concerned.

    把孩子引向何处？
    7月22日，湖南省邵阳市200多名香客为次日去南岳进香而在市区各庵堂烧“起程香”。在长长的队伍中，有五六名6至12岁的小香客特别引人注目。他们跟大人一样打扮：青衣、青裤、青包头，身围红“抱肚”。有的端着拜香凳，能熟练地跟大人一起唱拜香歌和做各种礼拜动作。看到这情景，怎不令人担忧？　    杨民贵摄
