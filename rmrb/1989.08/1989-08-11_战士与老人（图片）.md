Soldier and the Elderly

On the eastern side of Dading Mountain in Naojia Village, Beizhangshan Island, Changdao County, Shandong Province, there used to be about a dozen households. Due to lack of electricity and water, most villagers moved down the mountain. By 1964, only five elderly people remained in the village, still attached to their homeland. At that time, the officers and soldiers of a certain radar observation unit took on the responsibility of caring for the elderly, carrying water, buying grain, gathering firewood, and providing medical care. Twenty-five years have passed, and now only one elderly person, Sun Baocheng, remains in Naojia Village. Although the soldiers guarding the island have changed from one generation to the next, the soldiers' care and concern for the elderly have never stopped.

    战士与老人
    山东省长岛县北长山岛的大顶山东侧，有一个孙家屯村，过去住着十几户人家。因缺电少水，村民大都搬到山下去了。到1964年，村里只剩下5个依然眷恋着故土的老人。当时某部雷达观察所的干部战士，挑起了照顾老人的担子，挑水、买粮、拾柴、送医……25年过去了，孙家屯村只剩下孙宝成一位老人了。虽然守岛的战士换了一茬又一茬，而战士们对老人的关心照顾一天也没停过。  刘永勤摄影报道
