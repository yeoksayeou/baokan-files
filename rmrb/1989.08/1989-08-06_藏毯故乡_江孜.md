When visiting a Tibetan family, you will notice that the beds and chairs are covered with small, intricately patterned carpets known as "Kadem" in Tibetan. These are a type of traditional Tibetan handicraft that is widely loved by the Tibetan people.

In Tibet, factories and individuals producing Kadem carpets are scattered throughout cities, towns, and rural pastoral areas. However, only Gyangze is renowned as the "Birthplace of Tibetan Carpets" or the "Kadem Town."

In early May, the reporter traveled from Zêdang by car to Gyangze to cover the birthplace of Tibetan carpets. Passing through Gonggar Airport and crossing the Gangbala Mountain at an altitude of over 5,000 meters, the journey continued along the winding shores of the "Holy Lake" Yamdrok Yumtso for over a hundred kilometers, finally arriving in Gyangze.

The most striking sight upon arrival is the anti-British artillery platform standing tall on the top of the city's Tsong Mountain. It reminds one of the heroic struggle of the Gyangze people against British aggression in 1904, from which the name "Heroic City of Gyangze" originated. Today, the people of Gyangze are creating a better life with their own hands.

It is understood that Gyangze has a history of over 600 years in producing Kadem carpets. Gyangze Kadem carpets are famous worldwide for their fine weaving, innovative patterns, elegant and ancient designs, durability, and resistance to wear and tear. They are rich in ethnic characteristics and local flavor. In 1954, the Gyangze Work Committee of the Communist Party of China invested over 100,000 yuan in interest-free loans to support this ethnic handicraft industry, enabling it to develop rapidly. The number of workers increased, and the variety of colors and patterns not only preserved traditional designs but also created large carpets and wall hangings reflecting real life, such as grassland scenery, Mount Everest, the Potala Palace, the Great Wall, pandas, and dragon and phoenix flowers. However, the significant development of Gyangze Kadem carpets occurred in the past decade. Currently, the number of Kadem factories in the county has increased from one in 1979 to four, with over 500 individual households and approximately 2,000 people engaged in Kadem production. Gyangze carpets have entered the international market.

The reporter visited the Kadem factory in Gyangze City. Here, all processes such as combing, spinning, weaving, and cutting are done by hand. According to the introduction, both domestic and foreign customers prefer pure handmade products. The factory director, Puwangdui, is a Tibetan, 42 years old, with a junior high school education. He appears simple and efficient. He briefly introduced the changes in the factory over the past two years to the reporter.

Now, the factory has 36 employees, all operating under a contract responsibility system. Workers are paid by piecework, with the highest annual salary reaching 1,600 yuan, and the highest bonus amounting to 2,000 yuan. Puwangdui said, "My contract is for three years. Last year, the profit was set at 800,000 yuan, and for 1990, we plan for 1 million yuan. However, last year we achieved 1.1 million yuan. Next year, we aim to create a profit of 1.5 million yuan and increase the number of workers to 100. After the three-year contract period, I still want to continue."

His eyes were filled with hope and confidence.

"Swish, swish, swish," the female worker, Benbaqianduo, sat on the doorstep, using two small brushes to comb the sheep's wool for weaving Kadem carpets. Soon, she ran over to sit next to Puquoma, helping her grandmother weave the carpets, already like a little "master weaver." "Even a seven-year-old girl is so skilled; the title 'Birthplace of Tibetan Carpets' is truly well-deserved!" After seeing Benbaqianduo's performance in the weaving household of Puquoma in Chengguan District, I couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

Puquoma is a kind and friendly Tibetan grandmother. She started learning to weave Kadem carpets at the age of ten and later became a weaving expert. Now, although Puquoma is over sixty, she still does everything from washing the wool, spinning the thread, dyeing, to weaving carpets. To help her fellow villagers become wealthy sooner, she tirelessly teaches young people the art of weaving carpets for free, providing them with food and accommodation during their year-long learning period. In the past decade, she has trained sixteen apprentices, including three men. Her granddaughter, Benbaqianduo, also became her little apprentice during her school breaks. Her son, Habaciren, is a worker at the county grain and oil processing plant and is also his mother's part-time assistant. Puquoma happily told the reporter that her family earns a net profit of 3,000 yuan a year.

In the county committee office, I met the county committee office director, Lu Shisheng. This cadre from Shanxi Province, with a thick Shanxi accent, introduced the situation of Kadem carpet production in the county over the past few years and discussed the county committee and government's plans for developing Kadem carpet production: "Starting this winter, we will implement a unified management, unified design, and unified quality standard approach across the county, organizing production in a dispersed, flow-line manner to vigorously develop Kadem carpet production. We aim to have 5,000 people engaged in Kadem carpet production by 1992, with an annual production of over 100,000 square meters of carpets, exporting 40,000 to 50,000 square meters annually. To achieve this goal, we will first focus on technical training, expected to be completed this winter and next spring. Secondly, in terms of production methods, we will combine professional and part-time work, long-term and seasonal work, factory production and household production, and collective and individual production."

He also said, "Additionally, the county will establish a Kadem carpet production development company to unify the procurement of raw materials, production organization, and sales. We will accumulate funds through Kadem carpet production to open up a breakthrough for the development of ethnic handicrafts."

This breakthrough, I think, can also be said to be Gyangze's breakthrough to the world.

   “藏毯故乡”江孜
    本报记者　傅旭
    到藏民家里做客，你都会看到，床上和椅子上铺着一种织有各种图案的小型仿古毯，这就是藏语称之为“卡垫”的藏毯。它是藏族人民普遍喜爱的一种民族手工艺品。
    在西藏，织卡垫的工厂和个人遍及城镇和农村牧区，但唯有江孜被誉为“藏毯故乡”，或“卡垫之乡”。
    五月初，记者从泽当乘车西行，踏上采访藏毯故乡的路程。经贡嘎机场，翻过海拔五千多米的岗巴拉山，沿碧波荡漾的“圣湖”——羊卓雍湖蜿蜒前行百余公里，便来到江孜。
    一眼望去，最引人注目的是那巍然屹立于城区宗山顶上的抗英炮台。它使人联想到一九○四年江孜人民在这里进行的那场英勇的抗英斗争，“英雄城江孜”即由此而来。今天的江孜人，正用自己的双手在创造美好的生活。
    据了解，江孜生产卡垫已有六百多年的历史。江孜卡垫以织法细密、图案新颖、选形古朴典雅、耐磨抗蚀，并富有浓郁的民族风格和地方特色而闻名于世。一九五四年，中共江孜分工委投放十多万元无息贷款扶持这一民族手工业，使它获得较快发展，从业人员增加，花色品种除保持传统的花纹图案，还创作出草原风光、珠穆朗玛峰、布达拉宫、万里长城、熊猫、龙凤花等反映现实生活的大型地毯、壁毯。不过，江孜卡垫生产的长足发展还是在近十年。目前，全县卡垫厂已由一九七九年的一个发展为四个，从事卡垫生产的个体户五百多，约两千人，江孜地毯已进入国际市场。
    记者走访了江孜城关镇卡垫厂，这里的梳、纺、织、剪等工序均为手工操作。据介绍，国内外顾客均喜欢纯手工制品。厂长普旺堆是藏族人，今年四十二岁，具有初中二年级的文化水平，看上去纯朴、干练。他向记者简要介绍了近两年厂子发生的变化。
    现在这个厂有职工三十六人，全部实行承包责任制。工人为计件工资，一年最高的工资高达一千六百元，奖金最多的可得两千元。普旺堆说：“我的承包合同一订三年，去年利润定为八万元，一九九○年预计十万元，结果去年就完成了十一万，明年我们争取创利润十五万元，工人增加到一百名。三年承包期满后，我还想继续干。”
    他的眼神中充满了希望和自信。
    “刷刷刷”，女工边巴片多坐在门口台阶上，两只小手各拿一把刷子在梳理着织卡垫用的羊毛。一会儿，她又跑过去坐在普卓玛身边，帮奶奶织起卡垫来，俨然一个织卡垫的“小师傅”。“连七岁的小姑娘都如此了得，‘藏毯故乡’真是名不虚传！”当我在城关区织毯个体户普卓玛家看到边巴片多的精彩表演后不由得发出这样的赞叹。
    普卓玛是位和蔼可亲的藏族老阿妈。她从十岁起学习织卡垫，后来成了织毯能手。现在，普卓玛虽年逾花甲，但洗毛、捻线、染色、织毯还是样样都干。为了帮助乡亲们早日富裕起来，她不辞辛苦地义务向年轻人传授织毯技术，在他们学习的一年多时间里，还免费提供食宿。近十年来，她已带出十六个徒弟，其中还有三个男性。小孙女边巴片多上学之余也成了奶奶的小徒弟。儿子哈巴茨仁是县粮油加工厂的工人，也是母亲的业余好助手。普卓玛高兴地告诉记者，她家一年可得纯利三千元。
    在县委机关院内，我见到了县委办公室主任陆世生，这位援藏干部带着浓重的山西口音介绍了近几年全县卡垫生产的情况后，又谈了县委县政府发展卡垫生产的设想：“从今冬开始，我们要在全县采取统一经营、统一管理、统一设计、统一质量标准，分散生产流水作业的办法，大力发展卡垫生产，力争在一九九二年全县从事卡垫生产的人员达到五千人，卡垫年产量达到一万平米以上，每年出口四千至五千平米。为实现这一目标，我们准备首先抓好技术培训工作，预计今冬明春完成。其次，在生产方法上，采取专业和兼业相结合，长期和季节相结合，工厂生产和家庭生产相结合，集体和个体生产相结合。”
    他还说：“另外，县里还要建立卡垫生产开发公司，统一负责原料购进、生产组织、销售工作。我们要通过卡垫生产积累资金，为民族手工业的发展打开突破口。”
    这个突破口，我想也可以说是江孜走向世界的突破口。
