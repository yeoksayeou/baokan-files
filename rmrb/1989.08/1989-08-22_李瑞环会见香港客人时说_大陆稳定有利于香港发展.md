    大陆稳定有利于香港发展
    新华社北京8月22日电　（记者杨国强）中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记李瑞环今天在会见香港客人时说，大陆的稳定有利于香港的发展，香港的繁荣符合全中国人民的利益。
    李瑞环对应邀来访的香港青年工商企业家访京团团员说，凡是炎黄子孙，包括大陆的、香港的、台湾的，都应该希望中国向好的方面发展，“这是整个中华民族的利益所在。”
    他在听取了客人们对香港情况的介绍后说，中国实行对外开放的政策不会改变，只会越来越好；“一国两制”的政策也不会改变，并且会更加认真地贯彻执行。
    在一小时的会见中，李瑞环强调指出，香港的稳定与繁荣对中国整个国家的建设和人民的利益是有好处的。“这种利益决定了中央政府会从祖国统一大业、从全国人民的根本利益出发，维护香港的稳定与繁荣；这种利益也决定了香港应该关心和维护大陆的稳定与发展。”
    他说，我们正在努力消除动乱和暴乱造成的消极影响，整个形势正朝着进一步稳定的方向发展。我们将扎扎实实地工作，通过事实，逐步消除外界对我们平息反革命暴乱所产生的疑虑。
    会见后，宾主共进晚餐。
