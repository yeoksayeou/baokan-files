From the recent release of the results of the third national forest resource survey, it can be seen that China's forestry industry has both joys and sorrows, as well as hopes. The joy is that the forest coverage rate has slightly increased, and the trend of decreasing forest area has begun to reverse. The sorrow is that the resource consumption exceeds the growth, the forest stock volume continues to decrease, and the forest quality declines. This indicates that the situation facing forestry is still very severe, and it is urgent to resolutely solve the problem of excessive forest resource consumption. If we miss this opportunity, we will make an irreparable historical mistake.

This is not an exaggeration. Look at the facts: Compared to more than seven years ago, the area of mature and over-mature timber forests in China has decreased by one-third; the stock volume of mature and over-mature forests has also decreased by one-third; the phenomenon of annual consumption exceeding annual growth is becoming more serious, with an average annual "deficit" logging of 1.7 billion cubic meters! If we continue at this rate of consumption, the stock volume of mature and over-mature timber forests will only last for another 7 to 8 years of logging. At that time, the axes and saws will have to be directed at a large number of young and middle-aged forests. Is this situation not serious enough?

Anyone with a bit of common sense knows the serious consequences of a sharp decline in forest resources. The harm will not just be to the forestry economy, but to all aspects of the national economy, and to the overall development of the Four Modernizations. It may even threaten the survival and development of the entire nation. Because forest resources are the foundation of forestry and the main body of the terrestrial ecosystem. Their functions in water conservation, windbreak, sand fixation, soil and water conservation, oxygen production, climate regulation, environmental purification, and wildlife protection are irreplaceable by any other resources. The increase or decrease of forest resources is related to the future and destiny of the country and the nation, and also to the life of every family. In this sense, protecting forest resources and reversing the forestry crisis is not just the responsibility of the forestry department, but a common task for the whole society and an inescapable responsibility for every citizen. No one wants to see that in a few years, the place where our nation has lived and thrived for generations will have no mature trees to find and no forests to log.

In fact, the forest resource crisis did not start today. The call to stop excessive consumption has been made for many years, and the "Forest Law" aimed at protecting and rationally utilizing resources was promulgated and implemented four years ago. However, why do illegal logging incidents still occur frequently, and the situation of excessive consumption still worsens year by year? There are many reasons, some of which are urgent practical difficulties that need to be studied and solved, and some are problems of ideological understanding. But the most important reason is that a considerable number of leaders have not truly placed forestry in the right position in their minds. Some still view forestry with traditional concepts, seeing only the economic value of "big logs" and ignoring the huge ecological and social benefits of forests; some only care about local and immediate interests, seeking quick results, and pursuing "outstanding achievements" during their term of office, not hesitating to cut down forests to increase production and income; others are not very clear about the "assets," mistakenly thinking that "there are plenty of trees, they can grow back after being cut," and acting on vague feelings without a real sense of resource crisis. All of these have a common point: they have a very weak sense of the rule of law and do not take the "Forest Law" seriously, often consciously or unconsciously using power instead of law, or even leading the way in violating the law. Many facts show that places with serious illegal logging are often closely related to the support and indulgence of local leaders. Therefore, some people say, to manage the forests well, we must first manage the leaders. To alleviate the forestry crisis, we must start with correcting the leaders' thinking. Guangdong and a few other southern provinces have precisely grasped this point, establishing target responsibility systems from the provincial to the county level, actively afforesting, and strictly managing forests, thus quickly solving the problem of over-consumption and making forestry break out of the vicious cycle.

The situation is severe, but there is still hope. It is precisely the latest resource survey results that have shown people the hope of revitalizing forestry: the national forest area has increased, and the forest coverage rate has slightly improved. Although it has only increased by 0.98%, this is still a joyful new beginning! Forest resources are different from oil and coal. Through human effort, they can regenerate, turning from withered to flourishing, from decline to prosperity. The increase in forest coverage is the result of the persistent afforestation activities carried out nationwide in recent years. This shows that the rise and fall of forestry depend on people.

Increasing forest resources and alleviating the resource crisis is an urgent and arduous task facing the whole society. The policy is clear, and the regulations are clear. The key is to truly implement them. We should adopt a systematic engineering approach, take comprehensive measures, accelerate cultivation, strengthen protection, strengthen management, and rationally utilize, all at the same time. Simply put, it is: more planting, better management, less cutting, and better use. Currently, the most urgent and important tasks are more planting and less cutting. Various places can learn from the experience of Guangdong and other provinces, seriously formulate and implement afforestation and greening plans, implement the greening target responsibility system for leaders at all levels, organize and mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out afforestation, and at the same time strengthen the care and management of forests to effectively increase forest resources. On the other hand, we must insist on rule of law in forestry, truly follow the "Forest Law," strictly control the logging quota, resolutely stop illegal logging and over-quota logging, and quickly eliminate the forest "deficit." From top to bottom, we should clearly establish the concept that the "Forest Law" is the law of the state and must not be trampled on at will.

It can be believed that as long as leaders at all levels can fully attach importance to forestry and mobilize the whole society to take action, persistently, China's forestry industry will have the hope of breaking out of the predicament early.

### 林业：需要全社会的关心与支持

    林业：需要全社会的关心与支持
    本报记者　吴长生
    从最近公布的第三次全国森林资源清查结果可以看出，我国林业有喜有忧也有希望。喜的是森林覆盖率略有提高，森林面积下降趋势已开始扭转。忧的是资源消耗量超过生长量，森林蓄积量持续减少，森林质量下降。这表明，林业面临的形势仍然十分严峻，下狠心解决森林资源过量消耗问题已经刻不容缓。倘若贻误时机，我们将会铸成难以补救的历史性错误。
    这样说绝非危言耸听。请看事实：相比7年多前，我国用材林中成过熟林面积减少了1／3；成过熟林蓄积量也减少了1／3；年消耗量超过年生长量的现象越来越严重，成过熟林年均“赤字”采伐高达1.7亿立方米！按这样的消耗水平推算，现有用材林中的成过熟林蓄积量，仅够再采伐7至8年。到那时，伐木的斧锯将不得不指向大批中幼林。这种状况，难道还不够严重吗？
    稍有常识的人，都懂得森林资源锐减会带来怎样的严重后果。受害的绝不仅是林业经济，而是国民经济的各个方面，是四化建设的全局。甚至会危及整个民族的生存和发展。因为，森林资源是林业的基础，更是陆地生态系统的主体，它在涵养水源、防风固沙、保持水土、制造氧气、调节气候、净化环境、保护动物等方面的功能，是其他任何资源所无法替代的。森林资源的消长，关系着国家、民族的前途、命运，也关系着每个家庭的生活。从这个意义上讲，保护森林资源，扭转林业危机，绝不仅是林业部门一家的事，而且是全社会的共同任务，是每个公民义不容辞的责任。谁也不希望若干年后，我们民族世代生存繁衍的地方，出现难寻成材之树、更无可伐之林的情景。
    其实，森林资源危机并非始于今日，制止过量消耗问题已经呼吁多年，旨在保护和合理利用资源的《森林法》也在4年之前就颁布实施。可是，为什么乱砍滥伐事件还屡禁不止，过量消耗状况还逐年加重呢？原因很多，其中有些是亟待研究解决的实际困难，有些属于思想认识方面的问题。但最重要的原因是，相当一部分领导还没从思想上真正把林业摆对位置。有的依然以传统观念看待林业，只看到“大木头”的经济价值，忽略了森林的巨大生态、社会效益；有的只重局部利益、眼前利益，急功近利，片面追求任期内“政绩显赫”，不惜大砍林木增加产值、收入；有的则是对“家底”不甚了了，误以为“林子多着哩，砍了可以再长”，单凭模糊的感觉行事，没有真切的资源危机感。凡此种种，又都有一个共同之点，就是法制观念极其淡漠，根本没把《森林法》当法，以至常常自觉不自觉地以权代法甚至带头毁法。许多事实说明，乱砍滥伐现象严重的地方，往往都与当地领导支持纵容密切相关。因此有人说，要管好林子，先得管住领导。缓解林业危困，必须从端正领导思想做起。广东等少数南方省份，正是看准了这一点，从省到县层层建立目标责任制，积极造林，严格管林，结果很快就解决了超量消耗问题，使林业跳出了恶性循环的怪圈。
    形势严峻，但并非没有转机。也正是最新的资源清查结果，向人们展示了振兴林业的希望：全国森林面积有所增加，森林覆盖率略有提高。尽管只提高了0.98％，但这毕竟是令人欣喜的新开端！森林资源不同于石油和煤炭，通过人的主观努力，它可以再生，可以由枯转荣，转衰为盛。森林覆盖率的回升，正是近年来，全国上下坚持不懈地开展植树造林活动的结果。由此可见，林业兴也在人，衰也在人。
    增加森林资源，缓解资源危机，是摆在全社会面前的一项紧迫而又艰巨的任务。政策已定，法规已明，关键是要真抓实干。要用系统工程的观点，采取综合治理的措施，加快培育、加强保护、强化管理、合理利用，四管齐下。简单说就是：多造、管好、少砍、用好。当前最紧迫、最重要的是多造和少砍。各地可以借鉴广东等省的经验，认真制定并切实执行造林绿化规划，实行各级领导任期绿化目标责任制，组织动员广大群众，大力开展植树造林，同时加强抚育管护，以有效增加森林资源。另一方面，则要坚持以法治林，真正按照《森林法》，严格控制采伐限额，坚决制止乱砍滥伐和超限额采伐，尽快消灭森林“赤字”。从上到下，都应该明确树立这样的观念：《森林法》是国家的法律，绝不容许随意践踏。
    可以相信，只要各级领导都能充分重视林业，并动员全社会一起行动，持之以恒，我国林业就有希望早日冲出困境。
