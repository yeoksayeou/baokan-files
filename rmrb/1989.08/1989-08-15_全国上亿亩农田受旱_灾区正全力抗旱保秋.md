Currently, it is the critical period for the growth of autumn crops. Some regions in China are experiencing severe droughts. While maintaining high alert and striving for complete victory in flood control, the affected regions are actively organizing efforts to combat drought and ensure the autumn harvest. According to the Water Resources Department's Flood Control and Drought Relief Office, since July, rainfall has been uneven across most of China. Although there has been no large-scale, continuous drought, some regions have experienced severe drought conditions. As of August 9, the total area affected by drought nationwide has reached 169 million mu. The provinces of Shandong, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, eastern Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, northern Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, and Dalian are severely affected. Shandong Province, the most severely affected, has 49 million mu of farmland experiencing drought, with an estimated 8 million mu of autumn grain production facing serious threats.

In some drought-affected areas, reservoir water levels have decreased, and some residents are facing difficulties in obtaining drinking water. In Shandong Province, over 4 million people are experiencing water shortages, while in Guizhou Province, 2.3 million people and 1.5 million head of livestock are facing water shortages. The reservoirs in Tianjin and Beijing have low water levels, some small reservoirs have dried up, and rivers have stopped flowing.

Facing the threat of drought, the affected regions are taking immediate action, mobilizing manpower and resources to combat drought and ensure the autumn harvest. Shandong Province held an emergency teleconference, calling on all citizens to unite and combat drought to ensure the autumn harvest. A large number of officials have been dispatched to the front lines of drought relief, and relevant departments have mobilized a batch of diesel and fertilizers to support the affected areas. The banks of the Yellow River have broken the convention of not diverting water during the flood season, opening sluices to divert water from the Yellow River for irrigation. Hunan Province has organized over 4 million laborers, 110,000 sets of water-pumping machinery, 136,500 water wheels, and 1.28 million various manual water-lifting tools to combat drought.

    全国上亿亩农田受旱  灾区正全力抗旱保秋
    据新华社北京八月十五日电　（记者赵鹏）当前正值秋季农作物生长关键时期，我国部分地区出现较严重干旱，各受旱地区在提高警惕，夺取防汛全胜的同时，正积极组织力量抗旱保秋收。据水利部防汛抗旱办公室今天提供的情况，进入七月份以来，我国大部地区降雨不均，虽没有大范围持续干旱，但部分地区出现较严重旱情，截至八月九日，全国受旱面积已达一亿六千九百万亩，山东、新疆、陕西、四川东部、贵州、广西、河北北部、京、津、大连等地旱情重。旱情最重的山东省受旱面积达四千九百万亩，预计将有八百多万亩秋粮生产受到严重威胁。
    一些受旱地区水库蓄水量减少，部分人饮水发生困难。山东全省四百多万人饮水困难，贵州省有二百三十万人和一百五十多万头牲畜饮水困难。天津、北京两市水库蓄水少，一些小水库干涸，河道断流。
    面对干旱的威胁，受旱地区正紧急行动起来，调集人力物力，抗旱保秋收。山东省召开了紧急电话会议，号召全省人民动员起来抗旱保秋，大批干部已深入到抗旱第一线，有关部门已调集一批柴油、化肥支援灾区，黄河两岸打破汛期不引水常规，开闸引黄灌溉；湖南省已组织四百多万劳力，十一万多台套提水机械、十三万六千五百条水车和一百二十八万件各种人力提水工具投入抗旱。
