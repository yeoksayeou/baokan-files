Jinan is the largest city in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in China, famous as the "City of Springs." However, with the rapid development of industry and the increase in population, the city's construction in recent years has been somewhat unsatisfactory: housing is cramped, traffic is congested, springs have dried up, rivers have become foul-smelling, and ancient, elegant historical buildings have lost their luster.

In the era of reform, Jinan City boldly explored new paths to accelerate urban construction, implementing a series of measures to build and renovate the City of Springs: breaking away from the chaotic situation of multiple planning, land acquisition, and construction by various parties, adopting a comprehensive development approach with "six unifications" in planning, design, land acquisition, demolition, and construction coordination, and carrying out old city renovations in blocks and streets; implementing a combination of block and strip management to strengthen urban management; breaking away from monopolistic operations to form a competitive landscape, promoting the development of the urban construction industry; reforming the management system, improving internal contracting, and enhancing the comprehensive benefits of the city...

Thus, "miracles" have appeared: the largest suspension bridge in Asia spans the Yellow River; the large-scale modern "August 1st Interchange" was completed in just 7 months, standing tall at the city's central artery; the sports center, capable of hosting large-scale international and domestic comprehensive sports competitions, stands majestically in the city's green heart; the large-scale Yellow River Diversion Project, the Shizhu Mountain Reservoir Water Diversion Project, and the East-West Water Supply Projects have formed a daily water supply capacity of over 400,000 tons to the city, easing the tension of living and industrial water use. The Shun Well Commercial Street, designed based on the legend of Yu the Great drawing water, and the Chao Shan, Shun He, and other commercial streets are lined up, complementing each other; meanwhile, more than 40 major roads in the city have been widened and reconstructed, and more than 2,000 alleys have been fully asphalted. What makes the people of Jinan most proud is the 13 residential communities and 15 old city areas that have been sequentially put into use. Currently, the per capita housing area in the city has increased from 4.06 square meters 10 years ago to 7.40 square meters, ranking first among provincial capitals nationwide.

If you ascend the newly completed towering and magnificent Liberation Pavilion to overlook Jinan, the scenery of the City of Springs is within your view: the former moat, transformed into an encircling park, is like a colorful jade belt surrounding the ancient city, connecting the famous scenic areas of Wulongtan, Zhaotuping, Heihuping, Zhennuping, and Daming Lake into one, with extraordinary scenery; the luxurious buildings of Shun Gong Farm and Qilu Hotel are golden and dazzling, radiant and brilliant...

    泉城新姿
    杨秉云　徐守礼　王锡光
    济南是我国黄河下游最大的城市，是著名的“泉城”。可是，随着工业的迅猛发展，人口的膨胀，前些年城市的建设显得有些不尽如人意：住房拥挤，交通阻塞，泉水断涌，河道变臭，古朴典雅的历史建筑也随之黯然失色。
    在改革的年代，济南市大胆探索加快城市建设的新路子，制定出建设泉城、改造泉城的一系列措施：打破多家计划、多家征地、多家施工的混乱局面，实行规划、设计、征地、拆迁、施工配套等“六统一”的综合开发措施，成街连片地进行旧城改造；实行条块结合，强化城市管理；打破独家经营，形成竞争格局，促进城市建筑业的发展；改革管理体制，完善内部承包，提高城市的综合效益……
    于是，“奇迹”出现了：亚洲最大的公路斜拉桥飞架黄河两岸；大型现代化“八一立交桥”仅7个月时间便凌悬于市区中心要道；具有接待国际国内大型综合体育比赛能力的体育中心巍然矗立在市区的绿化中心；规模宏大的引黄（引黄河水入济）工程，卧虎山水库调水工程，以及东西部采水补给工程，形成了东南西北每天向市区供水40多万吨的能力，缓解了人们生活用水、工业用水的紧张状况。根据虞舜取水的神话设计建造的舜井商业街和朝山、顺河等商业街，鳞次栉比，相映成辉；与此同时，全市有40余条主要干道拓宽、改建，2000多条街巷全部实现了沥青化。最让泉城人引以为豪的是配套建设的13个住宅小区和成片成线改造的15个旧城区相继投入使用。目前全市人均住房面积已由10年前的4.06平方米增长到7.40平方米，居全国省会城市之首。
    如果你登上新近落成的峻拔辉煌的解放阁俯瞰济南，泉城景色尽收眼底：由原护城河改建的环城公园，像一条五光十色的翠链环绕着古城，将五龙潭、趵突泉、黑虎泉、珍珠泉、大明湖五大泉群组成的著名风景区联为一体，景色不凡；舜耕山庄、齐鲁宾馆等豪华建筑，金壁辉煌，灿烂夺目……
