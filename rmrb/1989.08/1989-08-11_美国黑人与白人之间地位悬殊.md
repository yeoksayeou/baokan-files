A report released by the National Research Council of the United States on July 27 indicates that there remains a significant gap in economic and social status between blacks and whites in the United States. The report states that during the 1940s and 1960s, the income gap between blacks and whites narrowed, but since the early 1970s, this gap has not only failed to narrow but has actually widened. According to statistics, in 1939, the average income for black men was $3,833, while for white men it was $8,745. By 1979, the average income for black men had risen to $15,160, and for white men it had risen to $23,032. In 1984, these figures had dropped to $13,218 for black men and $20,457 for white men.

The report also shows that there are significant disparities between blacks and whites in areas such as holding public office, educational opportunities, infant mortality rates, and crime rates.

    美国黑人与白人之间地位悬殊
    美国全国研究理事会7月27日发表的一份研究报告显示，美国的黑人与白人在经济和社会地位方面依然存在着巨大的差距。报告说，在40和60年代，黑人与白人的平均收入差距有所缩小，但70年代初以后这种差距不仅没有缩小，反而有所扩大。据统计，按1984年美元计算，1939年黑人男子的平均收入为3833美元，白人男子为8745美元；1979年，黑人男子的平均收入上升到15160美元，白人男子的平均收入上升到23032美元；1984年，两者分别下降到13218美元和20457美元。
    报告还显示，在担任公职、受教育机会、婴儿死亡率、犯罪率等方面，黑人与白人之间也存在着相当大的差距。  （新华社）
