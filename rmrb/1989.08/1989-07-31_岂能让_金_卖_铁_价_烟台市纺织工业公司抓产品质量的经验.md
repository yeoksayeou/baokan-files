In the context of tightening monetary policy and increasing difficulties in industrial production and operations, the Yantai Textile Industry Company has focused on improving product quality, thereby promoting the development of production and operations. From January to June this year, the company achieved a total industrial output value of 350 million yuan, an increase of 11.63% compared to the same period last year. It realized taxes and profits of 47.869 million yuan, an increase of 8.28% compared to the same period last year, and completed export procurement value of 141 million yuan, an increase of 47.7% compared to the same period last year.

In the past, due to favorable market conditions, the company had the problem of "not washing the mud off the radish when it grows fast," leading to a significant decline in product quality, which brought difficulties to production and operations. Even high-end products like wool sweaters saw a 20% drop in sales due to poor quality, resulting in "gold" being sold at "iron" prices and products lacking competitiveness. To address this issue, the company started by strengthening quality awareness, focusing on improving production and operations through quality, and took the following three steps:

1. **Treat the Root Cause First**: The company prioritized improving the quality of its products by focusing on basic work. Through organizing on-the-job training, it enhanced the operational skills of its employees. It also provided equipment management consulting services to its affiliated enterprises, helping them improve the actual performance of their equipment. As a result, the system-wide equipment completeness rate has been maintained at 93.6%.

2. **Use a Ladder to Climb Higher**: To improve product quality, the company conducted technological upgrades, leveraging advanced foreign equipment and technology to achieve significant improvements in product quality. Over the years, the company invested 27.8018 million US dollars to introduce 359 sets of advanced technology equipment, including computer flat knitting machines, shuttleless looms, and friction spinning machines. The application of these key technology equipment has driven the improvement of product quality and promoted the export of textile products. From January to June this year, the company completed an export procurement value of 141 million yuan, an increase of 47.7% compared to the same period last year, accounting for 40.29% of the total industrial output value. The export qualification rate has been stable at over 96%.

3. **Focus on Both Internal and External Quality**: In recent years, the textile market has been relatively stable, with intense competition. Generic products without unique features are quickly eliminated. In response, the company has focused on unifying the internal and external quality of its products, emphasizing the high quality and attractiveness of its generic products, thereby expanding its market coverage. In 1988, when the national knitting industry faced a surplus of polyester products, the company's knitting factory produced high-quality, attractive polyester tight-fitting shirts that opened up markets in North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China, and the products have been selling well ever since. Based on this, the company has vigorously developed branded, high-quality products. Currently, the company has 59 national, ministerial, and provincial-level quality products, forming ten flagship products such as wide-width fabrics, corduroy, and embroidery thread. This has led to a thriving production and supply situation throughout the system, and the company has maintained a price advantage, making production and operations increasingly vibrant.

    岂能让“金”卖“铁”价
    ——烟台市纺织工业公司抓产品质量的经验
    张光辉
    在压缩银根、工业生产经营困难增多的情况下，烟台市纺织工业公司狠抓产品质量的提高，促进了生产经营的发展。今年1—6月份，这个公司完成工业总产值3.5亿元，比去年同期增长11.63％，实现税利4786.9万元，比去年同期增长8.28％，完成出口收购值1.41亿元，比去年同期增长47.7％。
    过去这个公司由于市场看好，存在“萝卜快了不洗泥”的问题，产品质量明显下降，给生产经营带来困难，既使是羊毛衫等高档产品，也因质量不高降低20％销售，结果“黄金”卖“铁”价，产品没有竞争力。针对这一问题，这个公司从强化质量意识入手，围绕着靠质量搞活生产经营这一题目，作了三篇文章：
    一、治病先治本。这个公司以搞好基础工作为提高产品质量之本，通过开展岗位练兵，抓职工操作水平的提高，对所属企业进行了设备管理咨询服务，帮助企业抓设备实际水平的提高，使全系统设备完好率一直保持在93.6％的水平上。
    二、借梯子登高。围绕着提高产品质量，进行技术改造，发挥国外先进设备和技术的作用，借梯子登高，使产品质量大幅度提高。几年来，这个公司投资2780.18万美元，先后引进了电脑横机、剑杆织机、摩擦纺等具有国际先进水平的技术设备359台（套）。这些关键技术设备的应用，推进了产品质量的提高，促进了纺织产品的出口。今年1—6月份，这个公司完成出口收购值1.41亿元，比去年同期增长47.7％，占工业总产值的40.29％，出口合格率一直稳定在96％以上。
    三、注意产品内在质量，又注意产品外观质量，做到货真价实。近几年纺织市场较为平稳，市场竞争激烈，没有特色的大路产品很快就会被淘汰。对此，这个公司抓了产品内在和外观质量的统一，突出自己大路产品质优、物美的特色，扩大了市场覆盖率。1988年全国针织行业的涤纶产品滞销，这个公司的针织厂生产的涤纶紧身衫，以质优、物美开辟了华北、西北、东北三个市场，产品一直畅销。在此基础上，这个公司大力发展名牌优质产品，目前这个公司共有国优、部优、省优产品59个，形成了宽幅布、灯芯绒、绣花线等十大拳头产品，使全系统出现了产供两旺的好势头，而且还保持了价格上优势，生产经营越来越活。
