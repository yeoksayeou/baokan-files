	Experts and scholars in the capital suggest adhering to the four cardinal principles and strengthening party history research

	New China News Agency, Beijing, August 4th — Today, experts and scholars in the field of party history in the capital held a symposium at the Central Committee’s Party History Research Office and the Chinese Communist Party History Society. They suggested that efforts should be made to strengthen the construction of the team for party history research and teaching, and to improve the methods of party history research and teaching on the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles.

	The main topic of this symposium was how to adhere to the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization in the fields of party history research, teaching, and propaganda. The experts and scholars pointed out at the symposium that it is necessary to resist the liberalization trend of distorting, defaming, and denying the party’s history, and to uphold the unity of party principles and scientific principles.

	Shan Jiansun, deputy director of the Central Committee’s Party History Research Office, said that in the past period, some people advocated that “Marxism-Leninism in China is either dying or on its last legs,” and that “40 years of socialism in China have ended in failure.” Some people even declared that “it is time to settle accounts with Mao Zedong Thought.” During the recent turmoil, a small poster in a university campus slandered the Communist Party of China as “a treacherous party.” Some people even claimed that “70 years ago, the Chinese people should not have chosen Marxism-Leninism.” During the turmoil, a magazine published an article titled “End of the Century Retrospect” by Su Xiaokang, the main author of “River Elegy,” which attacked Marxism, attacked the Chinese revolution, and completely denied the party’s nearly 70 years of glorious struggle. He said that the essence of these statements is to create a basis for denying the leadership of the Communist Party and to shake people’s belief in the party’s leadership.

	Professor Liang Zhu of Peking University said that those who advocate liberalization have a view that the choice made during the May Fourth Movement to adopt Marxism was a mistake, that Marxism is not suitable for China, and that the Communist Party of China is a premature birth. They also spread a theory of power struggle, claiming that the struggles within the party are not about lines but about power. They portray the party’s history as worthless in order to make the broad masses of young people lose confidence in the party.

	Fan Shouxin, deputy director of the Party History Teaching and Research Office at the Central Party School, said that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, significant achievements have been made in party history research and teaching. However, the influence of bourgeois liberalization ideology cannot be underestimated. In recent years, in the methods of party history research, there has been too much subjective speculation and judgment, neglecting the historical materialist method. Some people have turned party history into a history of power struggles. In terms of content, there has been a trend of denial, as if the more one denies, the more liberated one’s thinking becomes. It is seen as rigid and leftist to affirm achievements in an objective and realistic manner.

	Professor Gai Jun of the Central Party School and others believe that one important reason for the emergence of liberalization trends in the field of party history research and teaching is the excessive self-denial in party history teaching, research, and propaganda, focusing more on problems and less on achievements. The existence of unhealthy tendencies within the party and the mistakes of the socialist state are also important reasons why some people doubt the party’s leadership.

### 首都一些专家学者建议  坚持四项原则　加强党史研究

    首都一些专家学者建议
    坚持四项原则　加强党史研究
    新华社北京8月4日电　首都一些党史专家和学者今天在中共中央党史研究室、中国中共党史学会举行的座谈会上建议，要加强党史研究和教学队伍建设，在坚持四项基本原则的前提下改进党史研究和教学的方法。
    这次座谈会主要讨论了在党史研究、教学和宣传领域中坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的问题。专家和学者们在座谈会上指出，必须抵制歪曲、丑化和否定党的历史的自由化倾向，坚持党性和科学性的统一。
    中共中央党史研究室副主任沙健孙介绍说，过去一段时期，一些人鼓吹“马列主义在中国要么寿终正寝、要么奄奄一息”，“在中国，40年的社会主义已惨败”。有人叫嚣“清算毛泽东主义的时候已经到了”。在这次动乱中，一个大学校园内贴出小字报，诬蔑中国共产党为“一代奸党”。还有人宣称，“70年前中国人就不应该选择马克思列宁主义。”在动乱期间，一个刊物刊登了《河殇》的主要作者苏晓康的《世纪末回眸》一文，攻击马克思主义，攻击中国革命，全盘否定党的近70年的光荣斗争史。他说，这些言论的实质是为否定共产党的领导制造根据，动摇人们对党的领导的信念。
    北京大学梁柱教授说，搞自由化的人有一个观点，就是所谓的选择失误论，认为“五四”时期选择马克思主义是一个失误，马克思主义不适合中国国情，认为中国共产党是早产儿。他们还散布一种权势论，认为党内的斗争不是路线斗争，而是权势之争。他们把党的历史说得一无是处，以便使广大青年丧失对党的信心。
    中央党校党史教研室副主任范守信说，十一届三中全会以来，党史研究和教学取得了很大成绩，但资产阶级自由化思想的影响不可低估。近年来，在党史研究的方法上，主观主义的推测判断太多，忽视了历史唯物主义的方法，有人把党史变成了争权夺利的斗争史；在内容上兴起了一股否定风，好像否定越多思想越解放，实事求是地肯定成绩就是僵化和太左。
    中央党校盖军教授等认为，在党史研究和教学领域出现自由化思潮的一个重要原因，就是在党史教学、研究和宣传中过度地否定自己，讲问题多，讲成绩少。党内存在的不正之风和社会主义国家的失误也是使一些人怀疑党的领导的重要原因。
