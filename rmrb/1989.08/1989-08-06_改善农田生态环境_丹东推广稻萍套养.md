	Improving Agricultural Ecological Environment: Dandong Promotes Duckweed and Rice Intercropping

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 6th - (Correspondent Wang Liming) In the northern rice fields of China, the city of Dandong in Liaoning Province has successfully implemented the intercropping of duckweed and rice, improving the agricultural ecological environment.

	To reverse the declining trend of soil fertility in rice fields, Dandong began experimenting with duckweed cultivation in rice fields in 1982. This plant from southern China is rich in protein and amino acids, making it both a fertilizer and a feed. By intercropping duckweed in the rows between rice plants at the appropriate time, a mutually beneficial relationship is established. Each acre of rice field with duckweed intercropping can yield 3,000 kilograms of duckweed during the rice growing season, which can be used as feed for pigs, poultry, and fish, reducing feed costs by 53%. Additionally, in the autumn, 1,500 kilograms of duckweed can be turned into soil fertilizer, converting into 35 kilograms of soil organic matter. The fertilizer effect the following year is equivalent to 20 kilograms of ammonium sulfate, increasing yield by 10%, and significantly improving soil quality.

	In 1987, Dandong expanded the duckweed and rice intercropping from small-scale trials to large-scale promotion. This year, the total area of duckweed and rice intercropping in the city has reached a new level, covering 80,000 acres.

    改善农田生态环境
    丹东推广稻萍套养
    新华社沈阳8月6日电　（通讯员王黎明）辽宁省丹东市在我国北方稻田里大面积种植红萍，成功地实行了稻萍套养，改善了农田生态环境。
    为了改变稻田地力逐年下降局面，丹东市从1982年开始在稻田里试种红萍。这种来自江南的植物含有较高的蛋白质和氨基酸，既可肥田，又可当饲料。他们将红萍在水稻行间适时套养，使稻萍互惠共生。每亩稻萍套养的稻田，能在水稻生育区捞萍3000公斤作猪、禽、鱼饲料，降低饲料成本53％，还能在秋后倒萍1500公斤作水田底肥，转化成35公斤土壤有机质，第二年肥效相当于20公斤硫铵，亩产增加10％，具有明显的改土培肥效果。
    1987年，丹东将稻萍套养由小面积试验转为大面积推广。今年，全市稻萍套养跨上了新台阶，总面积达到8万亩。
