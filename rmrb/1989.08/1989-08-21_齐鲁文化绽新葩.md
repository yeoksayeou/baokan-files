Shandong Province has long been renowned as the "Land of Qi and Lu" and the "Land of Etiquette." Qi-Lu culture, as an integral part of traditional Chinese culture, is like a historical corridor, rich and diverse, profound and extensive. Since the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, Qi-Lu culture has shown unprecedented prosperity and vitality. In recent years, cultural activities centered around folk culture and tourism have flourished across the province, infusing ancient culture with strong local characteristics and a fresh contemporary style, making Qi-Lu culture more vibrant, rich, and colorful.

The Confucius Culture Festival—held annually in Qufu, the hometown of Confucius and a famous historical and cultural city in China, around the time of Confucius' birthday (September 28th on the Gregorian calendar)—is a thematic cultural and tourism event. During the festival, the International Conference on Confucian Studies is convened, large-scale ancient music performances from the Spring and Autumn period are staged, grand sacrificial dances are performed, and cultural tourism and economic trade fairs are held.

The Weifang International Kite Festival—an international cultural event centered around kites—is held annually from April 1st to 10th. Weifang is one of China's three major kite-producing regions and is famous as the "City of Kites." The festival, with the theme of "promoting openness and fostering friendship," has been held six times, with its standards improving year by year and its benefits increasing with each iteration. Members of the International Kite Federation unanimously agreed to establish the federation's headquarters in Weifang.

The Mount Tai International Climbing Festival—an international sports and cultural event centered around Mount Tai culture—is held annually in the golden autumn. The international climbing activities are a showcase of the depth, longevity, and profundity of Qi-Lu culture. In addition to competitive climbing, the festival features ancient capping ceremonies, calligraphy and painting exhibitions, bonsai and root carving art exhibitions, cultural tourism, and economic trade fairs, allowing both domestic and international visitors to fully appreciate the grandeur of Mount Tai and the charm of Qi-Lu culture.

Other Qi-Lu cultural activities with local characteristics include the Lantern Festival in Zibo, the Grape Wine Art Festival in Yantai, the International Fishing Festival in Qingdao, and the Lantern Festival Book Fair in Huimin. These healthy, lively, and innovative cultural activities not only facilitate the exchange and integration of traditional and contemporary, Chinese and Western cultures, adding luster to Qi-Lu culture, but also lay a solid foundation for Shandong's opening up to the outside world and economic revitalization, injecting endless vitality.

    齐鲁文化绽新葩
    高挺先　黄泽存
    山东素以“齐鲁之邦”、“礼仪之乡”而著称。齐鲁文化作为中华民族传统文化的重要组成部分，宛如一条历史长廊，不仅琳琅满目，品类繁多，而且千品万汇，博大精深。新中国成立后，特别是改革开放以来，齐鲁文化更加展现出空前繁荣兴旺的景象。近几年在全省兴起的以民俗文化、旅游文化为龙头的对外文化活动，赋予了古老文化以浓厚的地方色彩和全新的时代风貌，使齐鲁文化更加繁荣丰富、异彩缤纷。
    孔子文化节——每年值孔子诞辰之际（公历9月28日），在孔子家乡、中国历史文化名城曲阜举办的专题性的文化旅游活动，届时，召开儒学国际学术研究会，演奏大型仿春秋古乐，表演盛大祭孔舞蹈，以及开展文化旅游和经贸洽谈等活动。
    潍坊国际风筝节——以风筝为载体的国际性文化活动，每年的4月1日至10日举行。潍坊是中国三大风筝产地之一，以“风筝城”名扬天下。风筝会以“促进开放、联结友谊”为宗旨，现已举办了六届，水平逐年提高，效益越办越好。国际风联成员国一致同意，将国际风联总部设在潍坊。
    泰山国际登山节——以泰山文化为中心的国际性文体活动，每年的金秋时节举行。国际登山活动，正是以此来展示齐鲁文化的浑厚、悠久和深沉。登山活动除进行竞技性登山外，还举行仿古封禅仪式，书画、盆景、根雕艺术展览、开展文化旅游和经济洽谈等活动，可使中外游人尽情领略泰山的雄姿和齐鲁文化的风彩。
    带有地方特色的齐鲁文化活动，还有淄博的元宵灯会、烟台的葡萄酒艺术节、青岛的国际钓鱼活动、惠民的灯节书会等。这些健康、活泼、新颖的文化活动，不仅沟通了传统与当代、中国与西方文化的交流和融合，使齐鲁文化锦上添花，而且又为山东的对外开放和经济振兴，奠定了雄厚的基础，注入了不尽的活力。
