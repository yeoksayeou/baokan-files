A type of reagent that can detect antibodies for the AIDS virus has been successfully developed and produced by the Shanghai Institute of Biological Products under the Ministry of Health. After being evaluated and inspected on-site by experts from the Danish National Serum Institute, it was concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of this reagent meet international standards for similar products.

The Shanghai Institute of Biological Products is a research and production unit for blood products. Currently, it processes 36 million milliliters of blood annually. To ensure the quality of blood products and prevent the spread of AIDS, a research team led by Deputy Researcher Wu Changlong has repeatedly developed and successfully created an AIDS virus detection reagent using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting methods.

    艾滋病毒检测剂在沪制成
    新华社上海8月14日电　一种能检测艾滋病毒抗体的试剂由卫生部上海生物制品研究所开发试制成功。经丹麦国立血清研究所专家鉴定和现场考核，认为这种试剂的灵敏度和特异性均达到国际同类试剂的水平。
    卫生部上海生物制品研究所是血液制品的生产和科研单位，目前每年用血量达3600万毫升，为了保证血液制品的质量，防止艾滋病传播，由吴常龙副研究员等组成的艾滋病毒诊断试剂课题组经过反复研制，终于成功地运用酶标法与免疫印染法完成了艾滋病毒的检测试剂的研究。
