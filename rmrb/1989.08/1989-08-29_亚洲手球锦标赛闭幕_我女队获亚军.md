Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 29th.

The third Asian Women's Handball Championship concluded today. The world champion South Korean team showcased their agile, versatile, and fast-paced style of play, defeating the Chinese team 29-24 to claim the championship.

The Chinese women's team secured the silver medal, while Japan and Chinese Taipei finished in third and fourth places, respectively.

In the men's competition, the Japanese team secured the silver medal after defeating Kuwait 26-13. Kuwait took the third place, and the Chinese team finished fourth.

In today's match against South Korea, the Chinese women's team failed to capitalize on their height and strength advantage. Instead, they allowed the shorter South Korean team to score from close range. In the first 20 minutes of the first half, China's defense was tight, breaking up several South Korean attempts to penetrate the goal area. However, China's offense was weak, lacking the aggressive spirit and individual breakthroughs needed to score more goals. Their outside shots were soft and ineffective. South Korea, on the other hand, adjusted their strategy to focus on outside shots, quickly moving and stretching China's defense, often changing direction suddenly to score.

In the second half, despite their best efforts, China could not close the gap, ultimately losing by five points.

In the evening, the organizing committee hosted a farewell banquet at the Great Hall of the People, where they announced the individual awards. The winners were: Best Coach - Women's Division: Park Jeong-gu (South Korea), Men's Division: Kim Gab-gyeong (South Korea); Best Athlete - Women's Division: Im Mi-jung (South Korea), Men's Division: Park Do-kwan (South Korea); Best Scorer - Women's Division: Shi Wei (China), Men's Division: Morteza Torbatiyan (Iran); Best Goalkeeper - Women's Division: Song Ji-hyeon (South Korea), Men's Division: Hashimoto Yukihiro (Japan).

Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa, in his speech at the banquet, expressed gratitude to the athletes from various countries for participating in the Asian Handball Championship in Beijing and extended a warm welcome to them for the upcoming Asian Games in Beijing next September.

    亚洲手球锦标赛闭幕
    我女队获亚军
    本报北京8月29日讯　记者李北大、吴骅报道：世界冠军南朝鲜队，今天与中国队争夺第二届亚洲女子手球锦标赛桂冠之战，成功地向人们展示了灵活多变、以小打大、以快取胜的技巧型打法，并以29∶24获胜夺得冠军杯。
    中国女队获亚军，日本和中国台北队分列第3、第4名。
    日本男队今天在以26∶13力克科威特队后，取得第五届男子手球锦标赛亚军，科威特队获得第3名，中国队仅列第4位。
    中国女队今天在与南朝鲜队比赛时，没有凭借自己身高体壮的优势大胆进攻，却让身材矮小的南朝鲜队在自家门前任意轮臂射门。在上半场前20分钟里，中国队防守严密，多次瓦解对方企图突入球门区攻门的战术，双方比分交替上升。可惜，中国队进攻不力，队员们缺乏勇往直前的拚劲和个人突破的能力，尤其外围射门软弱无力，无法扩大战果。而南朝鲜队及时改变策略，专打外围，她们快速移动，扯开中国队防线，常常突然变向一步跳起，轮臂猛射，屡屡奏效。上半场，她们以15∶10领先。
    下半场，中国队虽竭尽全力，但始终没有能缩小上半时拉开的比分，以5分之差败北。
    晚上，组委会在人民大会堂举行了欢送招待会，并宣布了获得个人奖的名单。获奖人是：最佳教练员：女子组朴正九（南朝鲜），男子组金甲经（南朝鲜）；最佳运动员：女子组任美璟（南朝鲜），男子组朴道宽（南朝鲜）；最佳射手：女子组石伟（中国），男子组莫尔特扎·托尔巴提安（伊朗）；最佳守门员：女子组宋之贤（南朝鲜），男子组桥本行弘（日本）。
    张百发副市长在招待会致词中，对各国运动员来北京参加亚洲手球锦标赛表示感谢，并热烈欢迎各国朋友明年金秋九月在北京亚运会上再次欢聚。
