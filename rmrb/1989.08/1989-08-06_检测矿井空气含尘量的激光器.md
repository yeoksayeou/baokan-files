Dust is the primary cause of pneumoconiosis. Preventing this occupational disease requires not only equipping mines with humidification and dust removal devices but also providing monitoring equipment that can accurately reflect real-time dust levels.

Researchers from the British National Health and Safety Department and River Engineering Company have jointly developed a new type of tracking monitoring system for measuring dust levels in mines, which is set to bring about significant changes in this field.

The new optical system, OZIRIS, designed to measure the concentration of inhalable dust, continuously monitors non-fibrous dust through a small monitor slightly larger than a brick. The monitor can be placed under the arch of the tunnel where it does not obstruct anyone. Air entering the monitor first passes through a settling chamber, where non-inhalable dust is removed from the air. The cleaned air then enters a container illuminated by a laser beam. Dust particles reflect the beam, causing the beam to scatter in a manner similar to dust particles dancing in sunlight. The number of reflections is directly proportional to the dust concentration in the air. These indices can be transmitted to a monitoring station, usually located in the mine's control room. One notable feature of OZIRIS is that the control software is intentionally stored on a floppy disk for an IBM personal computer. This program can check eight monitors installed up to eight kilometers away from the inspection instrument. Tasks such as determining concentration ranges and sampling can be completed within ten minutes each day.

Currently, the methods for measuring dust levels in mines are slow and cumbersome. Samplers are installed in the mine at a certain distance from the working face. After five hours, just before the end of the shift, the samplers are removed and sent to the laboratory. There, the filter paper is removed from the sampler and weighed. The difference in weight before and after sampling represents the amount of dust captured during that period. Laboratory analysis reports take several days to reach the mine. For mines with normally low dust levels, checks are conducted once a month; for mines with high dust levels, checks are conducted three to five times a month. Using this inspection method, it is not possible to record the instantaneous behavior of high-concentration dust clouds.

The monitors already installed in three mines in Britain have undergone effect checks comparing this method with traditional sampling methods, and the results are encouraging.

    检测矿井空气含尘量的激光器
    灰尘是尘肺的主要起因。预防这种职业病不但要求矿井配备湿润和除尘装置，还需配备能提供当时含尘水平真实准确信息的监测装置。
    英国国家卫生保健和劳动保护部门研究人员和里弗工程公司共同研制出测量矿井含尘量的新型跟踪监视系统，将使这个领域发生巨大变化。
    为测量可吸入粉尘浓度而制造的新型光学系统OZIRIS，通过比砖头稍大一点的小型监测器不间断地观测非纤维粉尘，监测器可安放到巷道拱顶下面谁都妨碍不着的地方。进入监测器的空气，先经过沉降槽，在那里从空气中清除掉不能吸入的灰分。没有这些杂质的空气随后进入一个被激光束照射的容器。灰尘反射光束，使光束散射成类似阳光下飞舞的微小尘埃。反射数目直接取决于空气含尘量。这些指数可以传送到通常位于矿井调度室内的监测站。OZIRIS的显著特点之一是，特意为此在I BM小型计算机的软盘上存储了控制软件。该程序可检验分别安装在距离检查仪器八公里远的八个监测器。像测定浓度范围和取样这类必须完成的任务，每天都能在十分钟内完成。
    目前测量矿井含尘量方法既慢又不灵巧。取样器安在矿井内距工作面一定距离上。过五个小时，即快下班时将取样器拿下来送往实验室。在那里从取样器中取出滤纸，再称重量。取样前后滤纸称量结果之差即为它在此期间捕捉到的灰尘量。实验室分析报告送到矿井前要过好几天。对平时含尘量低的矿井，一月只检查一次；含尘量高的矿井，一月检查三至五次。使用这种检查方法，不能把高浓度尘雾的瞬间行为记录下来。
    现已安装在英国三座矿井里的监测器通过了该法与传统取样法对比的效果检查，结果令人鼓舞。（边杰）
