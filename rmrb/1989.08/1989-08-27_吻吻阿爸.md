Kiss Dad

From the time I became aware of my own growth and realized I was a girl, I also realized I could no longer kiss Dad.

I still remember it clearly: that day after school, Dad was squatting at the front of the house, making me a small wooden gun with a red tassel (in those days, both boys and girls played with these). I was so happy that I hugged Dad's neck and kissed him hard. At that moment, Grandma walked out of the house, her face full of displeasure, saying, "You're such a big girl, aren't you ashamed?" I stared at Grandma, my little hands helplessly letting go. Since then, I have never kissed Dad again.

I was only 11 years old that year.

Since I was little, it was Dad who raised me. Dad loved drinking strong liquor. Dad said that when chopping firewood or carrying trees, drinking a sip made a person feel more invigorated. So, Dad would go up the mountain to chop firewood or carry trees, and I would always follow him, carrying a wooden liquor flask. Whenever Dad reached out his hand, I knew he wanted a sip, so I would pull out the wooden stopper and hand the flask to Dad. Sometimes, too happy, I would make Dad squat down, and I would stand on my tiptoes to pour the liquor into Dad's mouth. Dad loved fishing. He would carry a fishing net and an iron rod, and I would immediately pick up the fish basket and follow Dad. Dad would catch the fish and put them in the basket, and I would secretly release the smaller ones back into the stream. Dad would see this and smile, not getting angry. When the black, white, red, and green stone fish filled the basket, Dad would carry me and swim a few laps in the dark Dragon Pond. Dad would hunt in the snow, and I would always have a box of matches and cigarettes wrapped in layers of plastic paper in my arms, sitting in the wind-protected valley waiting for Dad. Mom still often says that when Dad was the militia company commander, he would hold me and shout orders. A few years ago, the family door still had a faded picture of a little girl. Mom said that I went to my grandmother's house for a few days, and Dad missed me, so he casually drew one. Mom also said that I looked like this when I was little.

Dad liked me, and I liked Dad. On the mountains and in the streams, everywhere there were scenes of Dad and me holding hands. When happy, Dad would hug me, carry me, kiss me, toss me, and carry me. I would kiss his rough and hard beard, teasing him. How many joyful moments of childhood were spent in Dad's arms and on his back, how many warm sleeps were left in Dad's arms and on his back.

More than 20 years have passed in a blink. Dad's head is now full of white hair, and I have gone from being a mountain girl to a graduate student. Far away from Dad's small mountain village, I have come to the capital.

Seeing city girls holding hands with their fathers, my heart would stir with a longing to hold Dad's hand and walk by the stream in front of our house again, just like in childhood! But when I return to the countryside and see Grandma, I think this idea is absurd. Dad also treats me like someone he can discuss important matters with. It is rare to see Dad once, and every time Dad would brew two cups of tea, hand one to me, and then seriously discuss with me about building a house, about my younger siblings. In Dad's eyes, I am no longer the daughter who could be freely affectionate in childhood. This time, seeing Dad, I saw another wrinkle on his forehead, and his white hair had increased. Dad is old, I thought to myself.

I still talk seriously with Dad. Although Dad softly said, "You really liked me when you were little." He said it very lightly. Then Dad immediately changed the subject: "So far away, every day during your commute, my heart is always hanging. You ride your bike more recklessly than boys!"

I stared at Dad, a surge of indescribable affection welled up from my heart. I really wanted to hug Dad's neck like in childhood, kiss Dad's wrinkled forehead, tidy Dad's white hair, and then tell Dad: I like you even more, I love you even more. But all this can only be left in my heart, left in my dreams. All this is because I have grown up, because we live in an ancient, ancient small mountain village.

    吻吻阿爸
    艾菲
    从意识到自己长大，也意识到自己是个女孩子，是从不能再吻吻阿爸开始的。
    至今还记得清清楚楚：那天放学，阿爸蹲在屋前道地上给我做一把带红缨的小木枪（那个时代的男孩女孩都玩这个）。我一高兴，便搂住阿爸的脖子使劲地亲起他来。这时，奶奶从屋里走出，满脸不高兴地说，那么大的姑娘了，不怕羞。我呆呆地看着奶奶，小手无可奈何地松了下来。自那以后，我一直没有再亲过阿爸。
    那一年我才11岁。
    自小是阿爸带的。阿爸爱喝烈性酒，阿爸说砍柴背树时喝上一口，人就爽气多了。于是阿爸上山砍柴背树，我总拎着一个用木头自制的酒壶儿跟在阿爸后头。阿爸一伸手，我便知道他想喝一口，便将酒壶的木塞拔出递给阿爸，有时太高兴，还让阿爸蹲下来，我踮着脚尖往阿爸嘴里灌酒。阿爸爱捕鱼，他一扛鱼筛和铁棍儿，我马上拎起鱼篓跟上阿爸。阿爸把鱼逮住放进篓里，我便把小一点的鱼偷偷放回溪里，阿爸见了笑笑，也不生气。当黑、白、红、绿大石斑鱼装满鱼篓时，阿爸驮着我在幽黑的龙潭里游上几圈。阿爸大雪天狩猎，我怀里总是揣着一盒用塑料纸裹了一层又一层的火柴盒和香烟，坐在背风的山凹里等阿爸。阿妈至今还常说，阿爸当民兵连长那阵子，抱着我喊口令。前几年家门上还能看到一个褪了色的小女孩像，阿妈说，我去外婆家住了几天，阿爸想我了，便随手画了一个。阿妈还说，我小时候就是这副样子。
    阿爸喜欢我，我也喜欢阿爸，山岭上、小溪里，到处都有阿爸和我手牵手的情景，高兴处，阿爸抱我，背我、亲我、颠我、驮我，我亲他又粗又硬的胡子，逗他。儿时多少欢快的时光在阿爸怀里、背上度过，多少温馨的睡眠留在阿爸怀里，阿爸背上。
    一晃20多年过去了，阿爸已是白发满头，我也从一个山妞儿变成了研究生。远远地离开了阿爸的那个小山村，到了京都。
    看到城里女孩子同父亲手挽手的情形，我心里便会激起一种渴望，能像儿时一样牵着阿爸的手在家门前的小溪边再走一趟多好！可回到乡里，见到奶奶，我便觉这念头怪荒唐的。阿爸也拿我当能商量大事的人看待了。难得跟阿爸见上一次，阿爸每次总沏上两碗茶，端一碗给我，然后认认真真地与我商量着盖房子的事、弟妹的事。阿爸眼里的我也不是小时可以随意亲热的女儿了。这次见到阿爸，见他额头上又多了一条皱纹，白发也愈加多了。阿爸老了，我心里想着。
    我依然和阿爸认认真真地聊天。虽然阿爸幽幽地说：“小时候你真喜欢我”。说得轻极了。然后阿爸马上转了话题：“那么远，每天的上下班时间里，我那颗心便悬着了。你骑车骑得比男孩子还野呢！”
    我怔怔地看着阿爸，一股说不出的亲情从心底里涌起，我真想像儿时一样搂着阿爸的脖子，吻吻阿爸那满是皱纹的额头，理理阿爸那满头的白发，然后对阿爸说：我更加喜欢您，更加热爱您。可这一切只能留在心里，留在梦里了。一切因为我已长大，因为我们生活在一个古老古老的小山村里。
