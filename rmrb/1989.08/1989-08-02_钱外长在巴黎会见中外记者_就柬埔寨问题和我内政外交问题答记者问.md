Chinese Foreign Minister Meets with Domestic and Foreign Journalists in Paris to Answer Questions on Cambodian Issues and China's Domestic and Foreign Affairs

	PARIS, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is leading the Chinese delegation to the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, met with some Chinese and foreign journalists covering the conference at the Chinese Embassy in France this noon and answered their questions.

	Qian said he had met with 11 foreign ministers, the UN Secretary-General, and representatives of the three factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk during his participation in the conference. He believed the conference had made a good start, but the international conference still faced complex problems and much work needed to be done. He hoped the conference could make progress and achieve success.

	When asked whether the progress made in the conference was due to concessions from the Sihanouk side or the Hun Sen side, Qian replied, "I think the good start of this conference is the result of efforts made by all the countries participating in the conference, including the four factions in Cambodia. The mainstream of the speeches made by various countries at the conference is the hope for a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian problem. Not only should foreign troops withdraw, but also help should be given to the various factions in Cambodia to achieve reconciliation. The conference decided to set up several committees to do the work. Please note that only when these four committees reach agreements can the final document of this international conference be formed. This is a comprehensive solution, not a partial one."

	When asked how to deal with the Pol Pot and Ieng Sary issue as the Cambodian problem is being solved, Qian said, "This is not a problem for us to solve. Our principle is that the four factions should unite, and who participates in it should be decided by themselves. Each faction's nominee should be acceptable to all factions, because if the nominees proposed by each faction are unacceptable, this unity will not succeed."

	When asked whether the success achieved in various bilateral contacts and in diplomacy during his stay in Paris would help China get out of its current predicament, Qian replied, "As I said just now, I have met with 11 foreign ministers here, including six from Western developed countries. They are the foreign ministers of France, Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States, and Japan. These countries have announced the suspension of high-level exchanges with China, but they have proposed to meet me, saying that meeting here does not fall within the scope of suspension. I told them that a government making foreign policy based on incorrect information and exaggerated propaganda is dangerous. Regarding the events in Beijing, I pointed out the following: you have heard that thousands or even tens of thousands of people have died in Beijing; you have heard that Deng Xiaoping no longer exists; you have heard that China has already had a civil war, and the military is fighting against the military. Which of these is true?!"

	Qian said to French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, "We believe that the incident in Paris has caused great damage to the relations between the two countries. First, our embassy's educational department has been attacked twice, but your embassy in Beijing has not been affected at all; second, during the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the great French Revolution, some of the programs directly interfered with China's internal affairs. The U.S. celebrated its national day on July 4, which is 10 days earlier than yours, but they did not do this; third, some people who fled to France have been encouraged and supported by the French government to engage in political activities against the Chinese government, which is interference in China's internal affairs. The French foreign minister said that France does not intend to interfere in China's internal affairs, and that those who come here seeking refuge are in accordance with the French constitution, but they cannot engage in political activities against China. Regarding the attack on the Chinese embassy, he expressed regret and said that he would strictly respect the privileges of the embassy. If the French government really does this, that would be good."

	When asked if China, like a few years ago, would launch a propaganda campaign to view Western influences as spiritual pollution, that is, Western pollution of China, and if the opposite were true, how China would think, Qian said, "China and Western countries have different historical traditions, social systems, values, and ways of life, which objectively exist. We can learn from each other, but we cannot impose on each other. We do not agree with or welcome some Western values, which is also very natural. Good or bad is one thing; whether it suits the Chinese situation is another. We can respect each other, but we should not impose our own things on others."

	When asked whether he only discussed the Cambodian issue or other issues during his meetings with Western foreign ministers, Qian replied, "We discussed two parts of the issue, one is the Cambodian issue, and the other is bilateral relations."

	When asked whether China is at a turning point and what political face China will present in the future, Qian said, "China's foreign policy has not changed at all, China's reform policy has not changed at all, and China's policy of opening up to the outside world has not changed at all. But if some countries want to close the door, we have no way. I said that China cannot exist without France, and France cannot exist without China; but China and France have common interests in politics and economics. If we cooperate with each other, it will be beneficial to both sides, but this depends on both sides. This time, the meetings with many foreign ministers have played a role in increasing mutual understanding. For example, the British Foreign Secretary proposed to resume the work of the Sino-British liaison group."

	When asked whether China's foreign policy would change given that Chinese newspapers and leaders attack the West every day, Qian believed, "We have not attacked the West, mainly the Western newspapers have attacked us. They say that Western newspapers are free and can attack anyone at will."

	The meeting between Qian and the journalists lasted for one hour.

    钱外长在巴黎会见中外记者
    就柬埔寨问题和我内政外交问题答记者问
    本报巴黎8月2日电　记者吕网大、张启华报道：出席柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议的中国代表团团长、外交部长钱其琛，今天中午在中国驻法国大使馆会见了采访这次会议的部分中外记者，并回答了他们提出的问题。
    钱外长说，我参加这次会议期间，会见了11位外长、联合国秘书长和以西哈努克亲王为首的民柬三方的代表。我认为这次会议有了一个好的开端，但是国际会议面临的问题还是很复杂的，还需要做很多工作。我希望国际会议能够取得进展并获得成功。
    记者问，这次会议能达成协议，取得进展，是由于西哈努克方面还是洪森方面作出了让步？
    钱外长回答说，我想这次会议能够有良好的开端，是所有参加会议的各个国家都共同作出了努力，包括柬四方也作出了努力。会议上各国发言的主流是希望柬埔寨问题得到全面的解决，不仅外国军队要撤走，而且要帮助柬埔寨各派实现和解。会议决定分成几个委员会来进行工作，请大家注意，只有当这4个委员会都达成协议，才能形成这次国际会议的最后文件，这就是全面解决，而不是部分解决。
    记者问，随着柬埔寨问题解决的进展，准备怎么解决波尔布特和英萨利的问题？
    钱外长说，这个问题不是属于我们解决的问题，我们的原则是他们四方联合，谁参加这由他们自己定。每方提出的人选应为各方接受，因为如果各方提出都是不能接受的人，这个联合不可能成功。
    记者问，通过您在巴黎期间各种双边接触，在会议上、外交上取得的成功，是否使中国开始摆脱所处的困境？
    钱外长回答说，我刚才说过，我在这儿会见了11位外长，其中包括6位西方发达国家外长。他们是法国、英国、澳大利亚、加拿大、美国、日本的外长。这些国家都宣布要中断同中国的高级的往来，他们提出来要见我，说在这儿见不算中断的范围。我对他们讲，一个政府根据不正确的情报和夸大的宣传来制订对外政策是危险的。对北京发生的事件，我举出这样几条，你们听说在北京死亡了几千人甚至上万人，你们听说邓小平已经不再存在了，你们听说中国已经发生内战，军队和军队之间打起来，哪一条是真的？！
    我对迪马外长说，我们认为巴黎发生的事情对两国关系损害很大。第一，我们的使馆教育处遭到过两次袭击，你们在北京的使馆没有受到任何影响；第二，在庆祝伟大的法国革命200周年的时候，中间有的节目是直接干涉中国内政的，美国庆祝国庆是7月4日，比你们早10天，他们也没这么做；第三，有些人逃亡到法国来了以后，法国政府纵容和支持他们进行反对中国政府的政治活动，这是干涉中国内政。法国外长说，法国不准备干涉中国内政，到这儿来的人求得庇护是符合法国宪法的，但是他们不能进行反对中国的政治活动。对中国使馆受到冲击，他表示遗憾，将严格尊重使馆的特权。如果法国政府真正这样做，那就好。
    记者问，中国像几年前那样发动了一场宣传活动，把西方的影响视为精神污染，也就是西方污染了中国。如果反过来，我们认为中国污染了西方，那中国会怎么想？
    钱外长说，中国和西方国家历史传统不同，社会制度不同，价值观念不同，生活方式不同，这是客观存在。我们双方可以互相学习，但是不能强加于人。我们对一些西方的价值观念不大赞成，不大欢迎，这也是很自然的。好坏是一个问题；适合不适合中国情况是另外一个问题。我们可以互相尊重，但不要把自己的东西强加于人。
    记者问，您在和西方国家外长会见中，是否只谈了柬埔寨问题，或者还谈了其它问题？
    钱外长回答说，谈了两部分问题，一个是柬埔寨问题，一个是双边关系问题。
    记者问，中国正处在一个转折点，以后的中国将以什么样的政治面目出现？
    钱外长说，中国的对外政策没有任何改变，中国的改革政策没有任何改变，中国的对外开放政策没有任何改变。但是如果有的国家要把门关起来，我们也没有办法。我说中国没有法国可以存在，法国没有中国也可以存在；但是中法在政治上、经济上有共同的利益，如果互相合作，对双方都是有利的，但这要取决于双方。这次同许多国家外长的会见，对增进相互之间的了解还是起到作用的。举一个例子，英国外交大臣提出，建议中英联络小组继续恢复工作。
    记者问，中国的对外政策不变，但现在中国的报纸、中国的领导人每天都对西方进行攻击，在这种情况下中国的对外政策能不变吗？
    钱外长认为，我们没有攻击西方，主要是西方报纸对我们攻击。他们说西方报纸是自由的，随便可以攻击任何人。
    钱外长同记者的会见持续了一个小时。
