Vicente Huidobro (1893–1948), a renowned Chilean poet, was the founder of the modernist poetry movement known as Creationism. He was born into a noble family in Santiago and, in his youth, was sent to study at a Jesuit school. Soon after, he dropped out and traveled to Argentina. He was deeply influenced by French culture and could write in French.

In 1912, Huidobro and his poet friends launched the magazine *Juventud Creadora*, promoting the poetry of Rubén Darío, the founder of modernist poetry. In 1916, while residing in Europe, he befriended avant-garde artists in Paris, including Pablo Picasso and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire. Later, he founded the magazine *Creación*, breaking away from all traditions and proposing "Creationism." In Madrid, he also met several Spanish poets. He supported various revolutionary movements that emerged in society at the time. In the 1920s, he supported the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union, calling it "the only hope, the last hope." In the 1930s, he opposed imperialism and supported the national independence struggles of various colonies. After returning to Chile, he founded the newspaper *Acción* in 1925 and participated in political activities. In the 1940s, he ran for the presidency of Chile as a candidate. After his defeat, he traveled abroad again, experiencing the Spanish Civil War and World War II. In 1945, he returned to Chile and died three years later in Cartagena, a suburb of Santiago.

In his youth, Huidobro admired French writers and was influenced by modernist poetry. However, he soon abandoned these movements, opposing all traditions, poetic formulas, and conventions, and rejecting affectation and imitation. He advocated that poetry is "absolute creation," and that "all innovation, all originality" is essential. He said, "Creating a poem is like nature creating a tree." He declared, "The poet's first duty is to create, the second duty is to create, and the third duty is still to create." In 1916, he formally proposed "Creationism" in Paris. In the articles "On the Art of Poetry" and the "1917 Manifesto," he systematically expounded the theory of Creationist poetry, which can be summarized as: personifying objects; making everything obscure clear and precise; concretizing abstract things and abstracting concrete things.

However, these theories were not successful in his practice. His poetic creation veered towards extreme formalism, even exhibiting structuralist characteristics. In his later years, he gradually abandoned these ideas and began to seriously explore poetry that could express his aesthetic thoughts. His works showed concern for the surrounding environment, with a straightforward, natural, and concise style, a strong lyrical atmosphere, and a certain philosophical depth. Huidobro was known as "a poet famous for issuing many literary manifestos." Although his "Creationism" was not successful, his spirit of daring innovation had a profound influence on the development of contemporary Latin American literature.

Huidobro's major poetic works include *El Espejo*, *Altazor*, *Temblor de Cielo*, and *Últimos Poemas*. He also wrote the novel *Mi Cid Campeador*, the play *En la Luna*, and the essay collection *Manifiestos*.

    创造主义诗派与维多夫罗
    黎华
    维森特·维多夫罗（1893—1948），智利著名诗人，现代主义诗歌流派创造主义的创始人。他出身于圣地亚哥一个贵族家庭，少年时被送入耶稣会学校求学，不久辍学到阿根廷游历。他深受法国文化的熏陶，能用法语写作。
    1912年，维多夫罗与诗友们合办《青年诗神》杂志，传播现代主义诗歌奠基人鲁文·达里奥的诗歌创作理论和风格。1916年，他旅居欧洲时，在巴黎与法国先锋派艺术家毕加索、诗人阿波里奈尔等人交往甚密。后来创办《创造》杂志，和一切传统决裂，提出“创造主义”。他在马德里还结识了一些西班牙诗人。当时社会上出现的一些新的革命思潮，他几乎都予以支持。20年代，他拥护苏联的社会主义革命，称之为“唯一的希望，最后的希望”。30年代，他反对帝国主义，拥护世界各殖民地的民族独立斗争。返回智利后，曾于1925年创办《行动》报，参与政治活动，并在40年代，作为总统候选人参加智利全国竞选。失败后，再次出国旅居，在国外经历了西班牙内战和第二次世界大战。1945年重返智利，3年后病逝于圣地亚哥远郊卡塔赫纳。
    维多夫罗年轻时推崇法国作家，同时接受现代主义诗歌的影响。但不久便摒弃了这些流派，反对一切传统，反对诗歌的程式和规范，反对做作和模仿，主张诗歌即是“绝对的创造”，“一切革新，一切独创”。他说：“创作一首诗就像自然创造一株树木一样。”并宣称“诗人的第一个职责是创造，第二个职责是创造，第三个职责还是创造。”1916年在巴黎正式提出“创造主义”，他在《论诗的艺术》和《1917年宣言》两篇文章中，曾较系统地阐述了创造主义的诗歌理论，可归纳为：把事物人格化；把一切晦涩的东西写得清晰和准确；把抽象的东西具体化，把具体的东西抽象化。
    但是这些理论通过他的实践证明并不成功，他的诗歌创作走上了形式主义的极端，甚至带有结构主义的特点。他在后期逐渐放弃这些主张，开始认真探索能够表现自己美学思想的诗歌，诗作表现出对周围环境的关心，诗风较为直率、自然、简练，抒情气氛浓郁，还带有一定的哲理性。维多夫罗被称为“一个发表了许多文学宣言而著名的诗人”，他提出的“创造主义”虽然并未成功，但他那种勇于革新的创造精神对当代拉丁美洲文学的发展具有颇为深远的影响。
    维多夫罗的诗作主要有《镜》、《北极的诗》、《逆风》和《最后的诗》等。他还写有长篇小说《我的熙德勇士》、剧本《在月亮上》以及论文集《宣言集》。
