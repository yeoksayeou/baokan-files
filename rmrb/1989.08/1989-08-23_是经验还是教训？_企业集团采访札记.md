    Experience or Lesson?
    – Notes from an Interview with an Enterprise Group
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Ma Changqing, Li Wei, Li Zhenghua

    Recently, Hangzhou City witnessed a heated debate that drew considerable attention.

    The Dongfeng Automobile Group, which includes the Hangzhou Automobile Factory, was one of the earliest to implement centralized asset management. Through the implementation of a separate planning system, it formed a relatively cohesive large economic entity and gradually played a "main force" role in national economic construction. The relevant national departments had previously introduced this as a successful experience. However, the Hangzhou Municipal Government lamented the "departure" of the Hangzhou Automobile Factory, with leaders declaring that this was a major "lesson" for Hangzhou City and that such large enterprises should never be "poached" again.

    Is it an "experience" or a "lesson"? The starkly different conclusions left people bewildered.

    To determine who is right and who is wrong, let's hear both sides of the argument.

    The "experience" proponents argue: After the establishment of the Dongfeng Automobile Group, it played a significant role in the structural adjustment of China's automobile industry. After Hangzhou's automobile industry was integrated into the Dongfeng Automobile development track, the control of products and production volumes ensured rapid but orderly development. At the same time, as a member of the Dongfeng Group, Hangzhou Automobile Factory benefited from its strategic position as a bridgehead in the southeastern coastal region, receiving attention in investment for technological upgrades and model changes. The "Qiantang River" automobile saw an annual increase of over 10%, and this also drove the planned development of local automobile supporting industries.

    The "lesson" proponents say: The Hangzhou Automobile Factory joined the Dongfeng Automobile Group through a non-compensatory transfer, with local benefits compensated in a fixed amount. The compensation amount was based on the factory's annual profit of 4.2 million yuan at that time. Now, the factory's annual profit has reached over 20 million yuan, but the local government cannot get a single additional yuan. However, the thousands of employees, along with their families and children, all rely on the local government for food, housing, and transportation. Hangzhou City provides annual living subsidies of over 3 million yuan to residents, which they enjoy; Hangzhou City's improvements in water, electricity, and gas supply benefit them; Hangzhou City's road construction to the factory gate benefits the workers. With this "in" and "out," Hangzhou City suffers a significant "loss"!

    Who is right and who is wrong? Some scholars in the theoretical community judge: "Logic" is with Dongfeng, "emotion" is with Hangzhou.

    Developing enterprise groups is a necessity for moving towards socialized large-scale production and adapting to domestic and international market competition. It is also a hope for China's economic takeoff and for becoming a world power. Therefore, the path taken by the Dongfeng Group is correct. However, developing enterprise groups must also consider local interests. Especially after the implementation of separate fiscal management, local government leaders inevitably prioritize the interests of their own regions; otherwise, the separate fiscal management would be meaningless.

    Understanding this, it is not difficult to see that the integration of "emotion" and "logic" is an important factor in the deep development of enterprise groups. In fact, without local support, enterprise groups would also find it difficult to succeed. The Hangzhou Automobile Factory originally planned to requisition 100 acres of land for technological transformation, but the local government did not fully support it, causing the transformation plan to be delayed by 2 years. Later, the Hangzhou Automobile Factory adjusted its policies, using the development of supporting products as a link to organize a second-tier horizontal cooperation, helping and supporting over 50 enterprises in the entire province and over 20 factories in Hangzhou City to develop, and the land requisition issue was also resolved relatively quickly.

    Of course, to achieve mutual satisfaction between the group and the local government, it also requires the guarantee of laws and policies. The Hangzhou City comrades suggested that under different "stoves," two methods can be adopted: first, promoting shareholding, with local governments and groups mutually holding shares and distributing dividends according to shares; second, under the premise of unified planning, technology, and quality within the group, adopting a policy of dividing output value, profits, products, and foreign exchange in a certain proportion to ensure local interests. Their suggestions are not without merit as a way to integrate "emotion" and "logic."

    是经验还是教训？
    ——企业集团采访札记
    新华社记者　马常青　李巍　李正华
    杭州市前一时期出现过一场颇为引人关注的论争。
    较早实行资产集中、包含杭州汽车厂在内的东风汽车集团，通过计划单列，形成了比较紧密的大型经济实体，在国民经济建设中逐渐发挥出“主力军”的作用。对此，国家有关部门曾作为成功经验加以介绍。而杭州市政府则对杭州汽车厂的“出走”痛心疾首，有关领导声称，这是杭州市的一大“教训”，今后再也不能让这样的大企业被“挖走”了。
    是“经验”还是“教训”？截然不同的结论使人们愕然。
    孰是孰非，还是听一听各自的“辩词”吧。
    “经验”论者认为：东风汽车集团成立后，对我国汽车工业的结构调整发挥了重要作用。杭州市汽车工业纳入东风汽车发展轨道后，产品、产量受到控制，发展快而不乱。同时，杭汽厂作为东风集团的成员，以其东南沿海桥头堡的地位而备受青睐，投资技改、改换车型等都受到重视。“钱塘江”汽车每年以百分之十几的速度上升，而且带动了地方汽车配套工业有计划的发展。
    “教训”论者说：杭州汽车厂加入东风汽车集团，采取的是无偿划转、地方利益定量补偿方式。定量补偿的数额是根据当初这家厂一年420万元的利润基数定的。如今工厂年利润已达2000多万元，地方却不能多得一分。可是这家厂数千职工以及家属、子女，吃、住、行都靠地方。杭州市一年给居民生活补贴300多万，他们享受到了；杭州市改造水、电、煤气，他们得益了；杭州市把公路修到厂门口，职工方便了。这一“进”一“出”，杭州市要蒙受多大“损失”！
    谁是谁非？理论界一些同志评判说：“理”在东风，“情”在杭州。
    发展企业集团，是走向社会化大生产、适应国内外市场竞争的需要，也是我国经济起飞和跻身世界强国之林的希望所在。因此东风集团的路子是对的。但是，发展企业集团又必须照顾地方利益。尤其是在财政分灶吃饭以后，地方政府领导人不可避免地首先要考虑本地区的利益，否则分灶也就没有意义。
    认识了这一点，就不难理解，“情”“理”相融是深化发展企业集团的一个重要因素。其实，离开地方的支持，企业集团也难以取得成功。杭州汽车厂原计划征用100亩土地进行技术改造，地方不大支持，改造规划被迫推迟2年。后来杭汽厂调整政策，以发展配套产品为纽带，组织第二层次的横向联合，帮助、支持全省50多家企业和杭州市20多家工厂得到发展，征地问题也就较快解决了。
    当然要做到集团、地方双满意，还要靠法制和政策的保证。杭州市的同志建议，在不同的“灶头”下，可采取两种办法：一是推行股份制，地方与集团互相参股，按股分红；二是在计划、技术、质量等统一于集团的前提下，采取产值、利润、产品、外汇按一定比例分成的政策，以保证地方利益。他们的建议，不失为一条促使“情”“理”相融的路子。
