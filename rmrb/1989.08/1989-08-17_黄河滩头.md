At dawn, the eastern sky glows with a warm orange hue. The banks of the Yellow River are dotted with numerous stalls, each selling fresh fish that leap and dart, and fruits that waft their sweet scents. The array of goods, both aquatic and terrestrial, is vast and inviting. A decade of reform has brought a vibrant spring to the Yellow River banks.

The Yellow River, once feared for its potential to cause calamity, now stands as a symbol of transformation. As I stroll along its banks, the willows sway gently, their grace captivating the eye. The ponds teeming with fish are like treasure troves; the towering trees, money trees. The newly planned pastures represent wealth in motion. White sheep frolic on the grass, their bleats filling the air with a pleasant melody. The shepherd, a high school graduate, is stocky and sturdy. He wears a bamboo hat, holds a shepherd's crook, and carries a green backpack filled with magazines, newspapers, and books on sheep farming. He also has a small bag containing two salted eggs, a bun, and a drink. He tells me he tends to ninety-nine sheep and several hundred ducks. The pasture is leased by his family. The sheep manure alone brings in a substantial income each year. The mutton supplies the village cafeteria, while the wool and hides are sold by the county's foreign trade department. The duck eggs are another source of income. The shepherd speaks with pride. His family combines agriculture and livestock farming, eliminating the need to buy fertilizer, as the accumulated sheep manure is more than sufficient.

In the fish ponds, a gentle breeze ripples the water, casting a shimmering light. Yellow River carp swim gracefully, leaving trails of ripples. The transformation of the Yellow River banks is nothing short of miraculous. The Yellow River, an ancient river, has witnessed both devastating floods and severe droughts. It has swallowed villages and dried up to the point of killing loaches. This place is a tapestry of both tragic past and radiant future. The ponds, like stars scattered across the landscape, are the most enchanting part of this tapestry. The beautiful scenery is painted on this very earth. It was once hidden behind the mist of centuries, but history flows, and beauty never stands still. Standing on the Yellow River banks, I feel a vast expanse within my heart. To witness the Yellow River's splendor today is a true blessing. These ponds are the bright eyes of the Yellow River banks. The willows and poplars, with their graceful forms, are the flowing locks of the Yellow River banks. The white waterfalls cascading down the mountains, like silken threads, are the radiant beams cast by the Yellow River banks. The verdant forests are inviting, and within their green depths, red flowers bloom, their vibrant hues contrasting beautifully with the white waterfalls, creating a scene of unparalleled beauty. The fiery red, pure white, deep green, and light blue, along with the orange hue of the sun on the mountaintops, blend together like a masterful oil painting. The interplay of these colors is both vivid and harmonious. As the rising sun illuminates the landscape, the reflections between the mountains and water create a mesmerizing, ever-changing spectacle. The emerald forests with their fiery red blooms are a testament to the beauty of nature. This Yellow River bank is indeed a magical world, inspiring a burning passion within the heart. It reminds me that life, too, should be as vibrant and colorful as these mountains and rivers. Since nature is diverse and colorful, and humans are the masters of nature, we too should be diverse and colorful. The surging currents of the great river and the cascading waterfalls on the mountain peaks each have their unique charm. Truly, the mountains and rivers complement each other in perfect harmony.

As I walk along the Yellow River banks, I come across an endless expanse of reeds. Their green stems and white flowers sway in the breeze, resembling bamboo in their segmented, hollow structure. They are excellent materials for building houses in the north. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, these reeds on the Yellow River banks served as the green screens for the Eighth Route Army, confounding the enemy. Countless poems have been written in praise of the reeds. For instance, the Tang poet Yong Yu wrote: "On both sides of the river, the reeds grow thick, their branches swaying with the waves. The moonlight shines like snow, and the fisherman's home is nowhere to be found." Another Tang poet, Wang Changling, in his "Border Song," wrote: "The cicadas sing among the mulberry trees, the eighth month on the Xiaoguan Road. Out of the pass and into the pass, everywhere the yellow reeds grow." The reeds are also the guardians of the Yellow River dikes. They fear neither fierce winds nor thunderstorms. Rooted in the earth, their leaves reaching for the sky, they stand with the dikes, year after year, protecting them. These reeds, the bamboo of the north, are truly friends of the people and guardians of the Yellow River dikes. Ah, the Yellow River banks, how vast and glorious you are! The Yellow River dikes, the Yellow River banks, and the Yellow River itself all coexist on this earth.

    黄河滩头
    湖涌
    拂晓，东方呈现出一片桔红色，黄河岸上已是摊摊点点星罗棋布了。鲜鱼活蹦乱跳，水果四处飘香。水陆杂陈，任挑任选。十年改革给黄河岸边带来了“满园春色关不住”的景色。
    黄河，曾被人们说得大有“谈黄色变”之势。我漫步在黄河滩头，绿柳妩媚，楚楚动人。那片片鱼塘就是黄河滩头的聚宝盆；那参天的树木就是棵棵摇钱树。那新规划出来的牧场，不就是流动着的财富吗？雪白的羊群，在那草地上撒欢奔波，不时发出悦耳的“哞哞”叫声。牧羊的小伙子是位高中毕业生，个头不高，长得墩墩实实的。他头戴顶竹凉帽，手拿着一根牧羊鞭，还挎着草绿色的书包。书包里放着几本杂志和报纸，还有介绍羊的饲养方面知识的书籍。另外还背着个小兜儿，里面是两个咸鸭蛋，馒头和饮料。他告诉我，他放牧九十九只羊，还养有几百只鸭子。这牧场是他家承包的。每年光扫起来的羊粪就是一大笔钱呢。羊肉供应乡里食堂，羊毛羊皮由县外贸经营。鸭蛋也是一笔收入。羊倌谈起来颇有些洋洋得意。他的家庭已是农牧业相结合。每年也用不着买化肥，因为光积攒的羊粪就自给有余了。
    养鱼塘里，微风吹来，粼粼碧波，流光溢彩。黄河鲤鱼浮在水面，向前游去，划出粼粼波纹。黄河滩头能有今天，这不能不说是一种巨变。黄河，是历史的老人。他经历过大洪浪峰，也经历过干裂涸渴。大浪吞没过村庄，大河也干死过泥鳅呢。这里既有悲惨的过去，又有光辉的未来。可以说，这里是色彩斑斓的长卷。我仰望那飘渺的云和远处那摩天的群山，还有那绿色的丛林。这绿色的生命就是水的功劳。这星罗棋布的鱼塘，就是这彩卷中最为神奇的部分。这美丽的画卷是在这大地上绘出来的。她曾经隐藏在世纪迷雾的背后，但历史是流动着的，美也永远不会凝固。我站在这黄河滩头，放眼望去，心里感到特别旷大。今日有缘目睹这黄河的容光，不能不说是一种幸福。这片片鱼塘就是这黄河滩头的明亮的眼睛。那妩媚的红柳绿杨，不正是黄河滩头的秀发吗？那山峦上的白练似的瀑布，飞雪溅玉，又宛如这黄河滩头甩出的亮光。丛林绿得诱人，丛绿之中透出红的花朵，红得那么浓烈，与白练似的瀑布相映成趣，美不胜收。火红、雪白、油绿、浅蓝，还有那阳光照在山顶上的桔黄色，恰如大幅油画中的五色，既鲜明又能溶为一体。五色重叠交错的景色，我敢说高明的画家也难以描摹其万一。尤其是经越升越高的太阳照射，在山与水之间反射出朦朦胧胧、变化莫测的折光，真是斑斓悦目。那青翠欲滴的丛林中透出火红来，不能不说是万绿丛中点点红，动人春色处处多啊！这黄河滩头可真是一个神奇的世界，站在这里，这景观给人一种燃烧着的激情。她使我想到，人生，也应像这山山水水一样壮丽多彩。既然大自然是多姿多彩的，而人们是自然界的主人，当然更应该是多彩多姿。那大河之中的激流撞击，那山峰之上的瀑布，各有妙处所在。真可谓山色水姿，珠联璧合。
    我漫步在黄河滩头，走着走着，面前出现一片无边无际的芦苇。青枝绿叶，飘花泛白，芦苇酷似竹子，有节而空。它是北方人盖房子编笆的好原料。这黄河岸上的芦苇，在那抗日战争的岁月里，也是我们八路军的青纱帐，在这里打得鬼子晕头转向。历代赞美芦苇的诗不知有多少。像唐人雍裕之所描述的：“夹岸复连沙，枝枝摇浪花。明月泻似雪，无处认渔家。”初唐诗人王昌龄《塞上曲》：“蝉鸣桑树间，八月萧关道；出塞复入塞，处处黄芦草。”芦苇还是保卫黄河大堤的勇士。它不怕狂风恶浪，不畏电闪雷鸣。她盘根于泥土之中，叶绿于大地之上。与大堤为伍，年年捍卫着大堤。这种芦苇——北方的竹子，实在是人们的好朋友，黄河大堤的捍卫者。啊，黄河滩头，你是何等的壮阔，又是何等的绚丽。黄河大堤、黄河滩头与黄河共存于大地上。
