A batch of economic criminals in Guangdong surrender to authorities and are given lenient treatment by procuratorates

Newspaper report from Guangzhou, August 2nd (Reporters Lü Yìzǐ, Tián Bǐngxìn): Recently, Vice Procurator-General Lu Chengjing of the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate revealed to reporters: In the first half of this year, a total of 92 embezzlement and bribery criminals surrendered to procuratorates across the province. Among them, many were criminals who embezzled or accepted bribes amounting to tens of thousands or even over 100,000 yuan.

Lu Chengjing said that in the first half of the year, procuratorates at all levels in Guangdong concentrated their efforts on investigating major cases. So far, the province has arrested a number of criminals who used their leadership positions to embezzle and accept bribes.

Lu Chengjing said that due to the public's exposure and denunciation, criminals, intimidated by the reports and the power of the law, voluntarily surrendered to procuratorates. For example, the cashier of the Agricultural Bank of China in Nanhai County, Liang Zhimin, embezzled 100,000 yuan and fled, but soon surrendered. According to statistics, out of the 39 people who surrendered in Shenzhen alone, 370,000 yuan in RMB, 35,000 HKD, as well as stereo systems, refrigerators, air conditioners, and video recorders were returned.

It is understood that for these lawbreakers who voluntarily surrendered, procuratorates at all levels have given them lenient treatment in accordance with the law.

    粤一批经济犯罪分子自首
    检察机关依法予以从宽处理
    新华社广州8月2日电  （记者吕毅子、田炳信）广东省人民检察院副检察长陆成景最近向记者透露：今年上半年，全省共有92名贪污、受贿犯罪分子到检察机关自首。其中不少是贪污受贿万元乃至10万元以上的案犯。
    陆成景说，上半年广东各级检察机关集中力量查处重大案件。到目前为止，全省已逮捕了一批利用领导职务进行贪污受贿的犯罪分子。
    陆成景说，由于群众的检举揭发，犯罪分子慑于举报和法律的威力，主动到检察机关投案自首。例如，南海县农业银行出纳员梁志明贪污10万元潜逃，不久投案自首。据统计，仅深圳市投案自首的39人便退出赃款37万多元人民币，3.5万余元港币及组合音响，冰箱，空调机和录像机等。
    据悉，对于这些主动投案自首的违法犯罪人员，各级检察机关都依法给予从宽处理。
