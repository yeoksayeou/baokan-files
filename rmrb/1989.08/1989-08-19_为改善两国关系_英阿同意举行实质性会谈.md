	For the improvement of bilateral relations, the United Kingdom and Argentina have agreed to hold substantive talks. Our reporter Liu Kaicheng reports from New York that after three days of talks in New York, the representatives of the UK and Argentina issued a joint statement today, agreeing to hold "substantive talks" in Madrid on October 17th and 18th.

	The statement said the talks will discuss UK-Argentina relations, including diplomatic and consular relations. Specific topics for discussion include measures to build trust, avoiding military conflicts, as well as trade and financial relations.

	The statement also mentioned that the talks will "protect" each country's stance on sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction over the Malvinas Islands.

	The two countries had a war in 1982 due to the dispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands, which led to long-term tensions in their relations.

	The statement pointed out that, to improve bilateral relations, both sides agreed to a package of measures to enhance diplomatic contact, including direct contact between officials of the foreign ministries.

	The statement concluded that the UK representative, Crispin Tickell, and the Argentine representative, Lucio García del Solar, emphasized that both governments are willing to seize the current opportunity to normalize relations and maintain peace and stability in the South Atlantic region.
