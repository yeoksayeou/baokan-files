The Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone is located in the wilderness of Mǎqiáozi Village by the Dàyáo Bay, 25 kilometers away from the city center. In October 1984, shortly after the development zone began construction, we came to report on it. At that time, it was still a vast expanse of sandy land, with not a single building, and all the facilities like water, electricity, gas, and roads had to be built from scratch. Some people were uncertain and worried about the blueprint of the development zone hanging on the wall: "Investing billions of yuan underground, who knows if there will be any foreign investment to set up factories!"

However, when we recently drove into the development zone again, we saw a completely different scene: new hotels, guesthouses, commercial buildings, and factories stood tall before us, and industrial, commercial, and residential areas were neatly distributed along the wide roads...

"It's not easy to turn the blueprint of the development zone into reality!" Zhou Haifei, deputy director of the development zone management committee, sighed. During the initial phase of the development zone's construction, the workload was particularly heavy. Every square meter developed required a large investment, hundreds of tons of steel and cement, and the movement of hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of soil and stones. Some people were impatient, wishing the project could be completed overnight. The Dalian municipal leadership proposed to proceed from reality, gradually realizing the planned area construction as projects are introduced, not seeking too much or too big, and achieving development, construction, and benefits in phases. Now, the infrastructure in the first phase of the development zone is fully equipped. The central substation, liquefied gas station, water treatment plant, program-controlled telephone exchange, and roads within the zone, as well as the cross-sea expressway to the city center, are all in place. Within the industrial zone, 131 enterprises have settled here, with a total investment of 1.8 billion yuan, forming industrial categories such as building materials, machinery and electronics, pharmaceuticals, light textiles, electronics, and chemicals.

The Dalian Development Zone is one of the earliest development zones approved by the State Council. The first phase of the development covers an area of only 5 square kilometers, with 3/5 of it being the industrial zone. Although it is not yet 5 years old, it already has considerable charm.

The development zone has established economic ties with more than 40 countries and regions in Japan, the United States, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia, and has successively set up 91 foreign-invested enterprises. Enterprises are almost side by side, filling up the 3-square-kilometer industrial zone. The attracted foreign investors not only invest in setting up enterprises themselves but also introduce friends and relatives to invest. Many foreign investors are continuously expanding their investments, and some "parent companies" have even spawned "subsidiaries."

The attraction of the development zone is a combination of various factors, but the high efficiency brought by the soft environment construction makes the development zone even more charming. Today's development zone has a streamlined and efficient organizational structure. The management committee has only 6 departments, with each department having as few as 6 people and as many as 20, but they handle a lot of work every day.

Hara Corporation, a long-established and technologically advanced automobile antenna manufacturer, has a significant share of the global market. Last year, Hara Corporation applied to set up a company in the development zone with a total investment of 2.5 billion yen. When the application report was submitted to the project promotion center of the development zone, the center immediately organized personnel to review it and provide consultation opinions. Such a large project took only 4 months from the investigation to the approval. During the construction period, the project promotion center also specially established a coordination group to help solve practical problems such as the direction of water pipes, cable costs, and boiler design. After 9 months, the 21,000-square-meter modern factory building was completed, 14 months ahead of the national deadline. Mr. Hara Jiro, the president of the company, said, "I am full of confidence in setting up a business in Dalian."

During the interview, we heard many vivid examples. On one day in December last year, the project promotion center of the development zone received a phone call from Mr. Kaim of the American International Industrial Company. The content was that he saw an article introducing the Dalian Development Zone in the overseas edition of the People's Daily and had the idea of coming to set up a business, but he couldn't leave at the moment and wanted to entrust the project promotion center to handle the relevant approval procedures, and sent all the materials. This is a wholly-owned enterprise investing 1.3 million US dollars to produce advanced industrial drills. The project promotion center immediately got busy, and after multiple telegram exchanges and the efforts of the project agent, the deal was finally sealed. In May of this year, Mr. Kaim came to the development zone and, after seeing the factory and the approval documents rented according to his requirements, excitedly said: "I didn't expect that the Dalian Development Zone in China has such capable people." He immediately decided to negotiate the establishment of another wholly-owned enterprise producing precision machine tools.

Planting osmanthus trees attracts phoenixes. Now, many high-tech, large-scale, and export-oriented investment projects have taken root and blossomed in the development zone. A responsible person in the development zone told us that the foreign-invested enterprises that have been established have 60% of the total investment from foreign investors, 94% of the enterprises are production-oriented, and the export rate of products is over 70%. The economic benefits and foreign exchange earnings of the enterprises are at the forefront of the country's development zones. The development zone's total industrial output value this year can reach 500 million yuan, and in another 5 years, it is expected to reach tens of billions of yuan. In about a dozen years, this place will become a modern new city.

    开放在大连（下）

    大连经济技术开发区兴建在大窑湾畔马桥子村的一片原野中，距市区25公里。1984年10月当开发区动工兴建不久，我们曾赶来采访。那时这里还是一片茫茫沙地，楼无半幢，水、电、煤气、路等设施全要从头修起。有些人心里没有底，对着那张挂在墙上的开发区建设蓝图发愁：“把数亿元投资埋在地下，还不知有没有外商来投资办厂！”
    然而，当我们日前驱车再次进入开发区时，看到的完全是另外一番景象：一幢幢新建的大酒店、宾馆、商业大楼、厂房屹立在人们面前，工业区、商业区、住宅区有序地分布在宽阔的道路两侧……
    “把开发区的建设蓝图变成现实真不容易！”开发区管委会副主任周海斐感慨地说。开发区建设初期，施工量特别大，每开发一平方米就需要很大投资，需数百吨钢材和水泥，搬运数百万土石方。有些人很急，恨不得一个晚上大功告成。大连市领导提出从实际出发，随着引进项目增加，逐步实现规划区建设，不贪多求大，做到开发一片，建设一片，收益一片。如今首期开发区内的基础设施已经完善配套，中心变电所、液化气站、净水厂、程控电话局以及区内道路和通往市区的跨海高速公路，一应齐全。工业区内，131家企业已在此落户，总投资达18亿元，已形成了建材、机电、医药、轻纺、电子、化工等工业门类。
    大连开发区是国务院最早批准兴办的一个开发区。首期开发面积仅5平方公里，其中3／5为工业区。别瞧它不足5周岁，但已有相当的魅力。
    开发区已同日本、美国、西欧和东南亚40多个国家和地区建立了经济往来关系，先后兴办了91家外商投资企业。一家挨着一家的企业几乎把3平方公里的工业区挤满了。被吸引来的外商不仅自己投资办企业，还介绍亲朋来投资。许多外商正在不断扩大投资，有些“母公司”还生了“子公司”。
    开发区的吸引力是多种因素的合成，但软环境建设带来的工作高效率，使开发区更具魅力。今天的开发区，机构设置少而精。管委会下设6个办事部门，每个部门少至6人，多则20多人，但每天办的事很多。
    日本原田株式会社是个历史悠久、技术先进的汽车天线的生产企业，产品总销量占世界市场很大比重。去年，原田株式会社申请在开发区兴办一家总投资为25亿日元的企业。当申请报告送到开发区项目推进中心时，这个中心立即组织人员审查，并提出咨询意见。这样大的一个项目从考察到审批完毕，只用了4个月时间。并帮这家企业基建期间，项目推进中心又专门成立了协调小组，帮助解决水管走向、电缆费用、锅炉设计等实际问题。9个月后，2.1万平方米的现代化厂房全部竣工，比国家规定的工期提前了14个月。该商社会长原田次郎先生感慨地说：“我在大连办企业充满了信心。”
    采访中听到生动事例很多。去年12月的一天，开发区项目推进中心收到一份来自美国国际工业公司凯姆先生的电话，内容大意是他从《人民日报》海外版上看到介绍大连开发区的文章后，萌发了前往办企业的念头，可一时脱不开身，想委托项目推进中心帮办有关审批手续，并传来了所有资料。这是一个投资130万美元、生产先进工业钻头的独资企业。项目推进中心立即忙碌起来，经过多次电传往来和项目代理人的努力，终于瓜熟蒂落。今年5月，凯姆先生来到开发区，看到按他要求所租的厂房和批文后，激动地说：没想到，中国大连开发区有这样能办事的人。当即决定洽谈再办一家生产精密机床的独资企业。
    栽有梧桐树，飞来金凤凰。现在，许多技术水平高、规模大、外向型的投资项目已经在开发区生根开花。开发区的一位负责人告诉我们，那些已兴办的外商投资企业，外商投资占总投资的60％，生产型企业占94％，产品出口率在70％以上。企业经济效益和出口创汇均居全国开发区前茅。开发区今年的工业总产值可达到5亿元，再过5年预计可达数十亿元，十几年后，这里将成为一个现代化的新型城市。
