The Garden Pond of Jiangshouju is a famous garden pond located in ancient Jiangzhou, now known as Xinjiang County in Shanxi Province. It is one of the earliest garden sites from the Sui and Tang dynasties in China. This square garden, measuring 200 meters on each side, features pavilions, terraces, and towering pines and cypresses. Although it shows signs of age, the garden's former splendor can still be imagined.

To the west, there is a gate known as the "Tiger and Leopard Gate." Surrounded by pines and cypresses, an octagonal pavilion stands proudly above a lotus pond, which is both unique and charming. Just a short distance from the pavilion is a narrow, winding path that leads to an elegant tower. Beyond the bridge, to the east, another scene unfolds: vines climb the walls, fragrant flowers fill the air, and a rockery stands tall with an arched doorway. A winding path leads to a high platform. From this vantage point, the entire city can be seen. To the west and north, the majestic Ma Shou Mountain looms; to the east and south, the Fen River flows like a silk ribbon beneath the ancient city of Jiangzhou. To the northeast, a towering pagoda stands in harmony with the garden. From above, the city walls and houses are clearly visible, and the entire city is within view.

This garden was first built in the 16th year of the Kaihuang era during the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty (596 AD) by Liang Jie, the military governor and county magistrate. It was famous throughout the region at the time. Over the centuries, it has attracted countless scholars and poets. During the Tang and Song dynasties, famous poets such as Cen Shen, Ouyang Xiu, Mei Yaochen, and Fan Zhongyan all visited here to compose poems and sing praises. In 1960, the renowned archaeologist Wang Yeqiu visited the Garden Pond of Jiangshouju and wrote an article titled "Clearing the Mist to See the Garden Pond."

    绛守居园池
    梁冬
    绛台使君府，亭台参天圃。
    一泉西北来，群峰高下睹。……
    这是宋代著名诗人范仲淹游览绛守居园池后所赋的《居园池》一诗。
    绛守居园池，座落在古绛州，今山西新绛县城。它是我国目前最早的隋唐时代的花园遗址之一。这座二百米见方的园池，亭台楼阁，松柏参天，尽管面目苍老，但当年的丰姿还依稀可见。西处墙开一门，名曰“虎豹门”，松柏环抱中，一座八角亭巍然屹立，凌空于回莲池之上，十米见方的池塘别致新奇。八角亭咫步之遥，是一条横穿其间的幽径土桥，林荫掩道，直至一座精巧的楼阁。被桥隔开的东端，又是一番景象，青藤缠绕，香馨扑鼻，假山耸峙，弧门洞开。弯弯曲曲的小径，把人引至一处高台。登临这一全城制高点远望，西北是虎踞龙盘的马首山，东南方一条宛如彩缎的汾河，在古绛州的脚下绵延，东北处巍巍宝塔与园池相映成趣。鸟瞰俯视，城廓房屋栉比，城市尽收眼底。
    这座园池于隋文帝开皇十六年（公元五九六年），由内军将县令梁轨首倡创建，在当时就闻名于各地。千载园池曾吸引了历代文人学士，唐、宋时代的岑参、欧阳修、梅尧臣、范仲淹等都到此吟诗作赋，讴歌吟唱。一九六○年著名考古专家王冶秋到绛守居园池考察，写下《拨开涩雾看园池》一文。
