The World Federation of Taiwan Compatriots Association (World Federation of Taiwan Compatriots Association) held its annual meeting in Taiwan, during which it vigorously promoted "Taiwan independence." This has drawn criticism and condemnation from the public and media, who have called on the Taiwanese authorities to take legal action against the organization.

According to reports, the World Federation of Taiwan Compatriots Association held its annual meeting in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, from August 1st to 4th. The theme of the meeting was "Establishing a New Nation." The organization's chairman, Li Xianrong, who entered Taiwan illegally, openly advocated for "Taiwan independence" and the "creation of a new constitution," asserting that "Taiwan independence is the only path to Taiwan's future." Vice Chairman Cai Minglu, Secretary-General Luo Yishi, and Central Committee member of the Taiwan Independence Alliance Cai Zhenglong also spoke at the meeting, advocating for "Taiwan independence." Additionally, participants marched through the streets of Kaohsiung, chanting slogans such as "Taiwan must be independent." At the conclusion of the meeting, a statement was issued, publicly proposing seven points, including "establishing a new and independent nation to ensure Taiwan's sovereign independence in the international community."

The activities of the World Federation of Taiwan Compatriots Association in Taiwan have drawn widespread attention. Some have criticized the Kuomintang for not taking action against Li Xianrong's public advocacy for "Taiwan independence" and for ignoring the presence of participants wearing "Taiwan Independence Alliance" sashes during the march. The editorial of the *Taiwan Xin Sheng Daily* called for the authorities to "take legal action against those promoting 'Taiwan independence' to prevent the spread of chaos." The *Taiwan Daily* also published an editorial stating that, historically and legally, Taiwan is a province of China. Culturally and ethnically, Taiwanese people are Chinese and descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The editorial emphasized that "the 'Taiwan independence' rhetoric must be strongly condemned; the 'Taiwan independence' actions can no longer be tolerated or ignored, and legal action must be taken immediately." It also called on all compatriots to stand up and "completely eradicate illegal separatist activities that collude with external forces to divide the country, sell out the nation, and harm the people."

Recently, newspapers such as the *Central Daily News*, *Youth Daily*, *China Daily*, and *United Daily News* have also opened columns to refute "Taiwan independence" rhetoric.

    世台会大肆鼓吹“台独”  台舆论和民众群起谴责
    据新华社香港八月二十二日电  据台北消息：“世界台湾同乡会联合会”在台湾召开年会期间大肆鼓吹“台湾独立”，遭到民众和舆论的批评、指责，他们纷纷要求台湾当局对“世台会”依法处理。
    据报道，“世台会”八月十日起连续四天在台湾高雄举行年会，会议主题为“建立新国家”。私自入境的“世台会”会长李宪荣公开主张“台湾独立”、“建立新宪法”，强调“台湾独立是台湾前途的唯一生路”。“世台会”副会长蔡铭禄、总干事罗益世、“台独联盟”中央委员蔡正隆等人，也在会上高谈“台湾独立”。同时，与会者在高雄市区游行，沿街高喊“台湾要独立”口号。年会结束时还发表声明，公开提出“建立一个新而独立的国家，使台湾在国际上有独立主权”等七点主张。
    “世台会”在台湾的活动，引起台湾各界的关注。有人指责台湾国民党为什么对李宪荣公开鼓吹“台独”不闻不问，对身披“台独联盟”布带游行视而不见？《台湾新生报》社论呼吁，对于鼓吹“台独”者，当局“必须依法处理，防止乱源扩大。”《台湾日报》也发表社论说，论历史、论法理，台湾是中国的领土，是中国的一省；论文化、论血统，台湾同胞都是中国人，都是炎黄子孙。对“台独”论调“必须严辞谴责；对‘台独’行径不能再容忍姑息，应该立即依法严办”；对“勾结外力搞分裂、卖国家、害人民的非法叛乱活动，全国同胞都应挺身而出，将其彻底扑灭”。
    台湾《中央日报》、《青年日报》、《中华日报》、《联合报》等近日也纷纷开辟专栏，驳斥“台独”言论。
