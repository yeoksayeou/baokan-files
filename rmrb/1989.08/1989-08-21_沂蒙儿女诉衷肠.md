The well-known song "Yimeng Mountain Folk Song" praises the eight hundred li of Mengshan and Yishui, expressing the ambitious spirit of the mountain people following the Party to transform the mountains and rivers. On the 40th birthday of the Republic, the people of Yimeng report to the motherland new achievements in carrying forward the legacy: In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of Linyi region was 11.22 billion yuan, 32 times higher than at the beginning of the founding of the nation; this year, the total industrial and agricultural output value can reach 13 billion yuan; cultural, scientific, technological, transportation, and foreign trade undertakings have made rapid progress; 80% of the impoverished mountain villages have initially solved the problem of basic sustenance.

This is a land of dedication. During the war years, the Yimeng Mountain area was a famous revolutionary base. The victory at Menglianggu shook the world. The story of the "Red Mother" saving wounded soldiers with her breast milk is heart-wrenching. To liberate all of China, tens of thousands of civilians rolled their carts to the front lines, and more than 60,000 outstanding youths shed their blood in Yimeng...

Due to historical and natural conditions, the people of the Yimeng Mountain area were once oppressed by poverty. Under the leadership of the Party and the call of socialism, the people of Yimeng maintained their traditions, worked hard to start businesses, and built more than a thousand reservoirs in the mountains, storing 4.4 billion cubic meters of floodwater. Agricultural land construction and other undertakings have also laid a certain foundation. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Yimeng Mountain truly opened its eyes. Stabilizing agriculture, developing industry, mastering the "mountain" script, and painting the "mountain and water" picture to welcome the civilization of the 1980s became the main theme of mountain area development and construction in the new era.

Indeed, the awakened Mengshan and Yishui also have their hidden pains. Until 1984, there were still a considerable number of villages in the northern mountainous areas with an annual per capita income of less than 150 yuan. Water was scarce, lighting was poor, roads were impassable, and children could not go to school. Many cadres, when introducing the situation to guests, would say: "Yimeng Mountain area is a good place, but..." The word "poor" was too heavy to utter. The people followed the Party steadfastly, and the Party was closely connected with the people. Several central leaders, after investigating and researching in the Yimeng Mountain area, emotionally said: "Seeing the old revolutionary base people who made great contributions to the revolution living in such hardship, we are uneasy in Zhongnanhai!" Therefore, helping the mountain area to get rid of poverty and become prosperous was placed on the agenda of leaders at all levels. A series of decisions to support the Yimeng Mountain area to get rid of poverty and become prosperous were made in a timely manner. The Party and government organs at the provincial, county, and township levels sent batch after batch of cadres to stay in poor mountain villages, using their deep feelings for the mountain people and practical spirit to help with poverty alleviation. When the clear and sweet spring water moistened the parched throats, the bright electric lights dispelled the darkness of the villages, the beautiful school buildings echoed with the sound of reading, and the elderly who had never been down the mountain rode in cars to visit the county seat, the gratitude of the mountain people was evident: "It is still the Communist Party that is good, socialism is good!"

This is the heartfelt words of the people of Yimeng to the Party!

    沂蒙儿女诉衷肠
    宋继民
    人人那个都说哎／沂蒙山好／沂蒙那个山上哎／好风光……这首名闻遐迩的《沂蒙山小调》，赞美了八百里蒙山沂水，抒发了山区人民跟着党改造山河的壮志豪情。当共和国40岁生日的时候，沂蒙儿女向祖国母亲报告继往开来的新成果：1988年临沂地区工农业总产值112.2亿元，比建国初期增长32倍；今年工农业总产值可达130亿元；文化、科技、交通、外贸等项事业突飞猛进；80％的贫困山村初步解决了温饱问题。
    这里是一片奉献的热土。战争年代，沂蒙山区是著名的革命根据地。孟良崮大捷威振海内外。“红嫂”乳汁救伤员的故事催人泪下。为解放全中国，几十万民工车轮滚滚上前线，6万多名优秀儿女血洒沂蒙……
    由于历史和自然条件的原因，沂蒙山区人民曾被一个“穷”字压得难以喘息。在党的领导和社会主义旗帜召唤下，沂蒙人民保持传统，艰苦创业，硬是在丛山峻岭间筑起千余座拦蓄洪水达44亿立方米的水库，农田基本建设和其他事业也打下一定基础。党的十一届三中全会之后，沂蒙山真正睁开了眼睛。稳定农业，发展工业，念好“山”字经，画好“山水画”，迎接20世纪80年代的文明，成为新时期山区开发建设的主旋律。
    诚然，醒来的蒙山沂水也有它的隐痛。直到1984年，北部山区腹地县还有相当一部分乡村年人均收入低于150元。吃水难，灯不明，路不通，娃娃上不了学。不少干部向客人介绍情况时说：“沂蒙山区是个好地方，就是……”，一个“穷”字太重了竟说不出口。人民跟党坚定不移，党与人民息息相关。几位中央领导同志到沂蒙山区调查研究后动情地说：看到曾对革命做出过重大贡献的老区人民如今生活这般艰苦，我们在中南海心里不安啊……！于是，帮助山区脱贫致富摆到各级领导的议事日程。扶持沂蒙山区脱贫致富的一系列决策应时而生。地、县、乡党政机关派出一批又一批干部进驻贫困山村，以对山区人民的深厚感情和实干精神包点扶贫。当清澈甘甜的泉水滋润了干渴的喉咙，雪亮的电灯扫尽山村的幽暗，漂亮的校舍中传出朗朗读书声，终年未下过山的老人乘车逛县城时，山区群众的感激之情溢于言表：还是共产党好，社会主义好哇！
    这是沂蒙儿女向党诉说的衷肠！
