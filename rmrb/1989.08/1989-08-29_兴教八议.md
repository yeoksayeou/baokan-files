To revitalize China, a serious issue stands before us: we must promote the entire nation's awakening on the matter of education.

The nine-year compulsory education system is the foundation of China's entire educational endeavor. It determines the ideological and cultural quality of our nation in the process of socialist modernization, and is also the "nursery" where a large number of talents grow healthily. To achieve the Four Modernizations and revitalize China, we must ensure that the nine-year compulsory education system is well-implemented. Without the intellectualization of the masses, there can be no Four Modernizations. This is as clear as the sun and moon in the sky, but people often have their vision obscured by clouds and cannot see clearly. The situation is somewhat better for higher education, but it is still not satisfactory. If, on the one hand, we are eager to achieve modernization, and on the other hand, we do not pay enough attention to education, then, from a strategic perspective, it is like an airplane taking off, neglecting the runway while rushing to the sky, which is bound to fail. This lagging effect of education in our socialist modernization construction has become increasingly apparent. Of course, we are not saying that we should wait until education is improved before proceeding with socialist modernization construction; this is also impossible. The key is to correctly handle the dialectical relationship between modernization construction and the development of education. Especially in a country like ours, with 1.1 billion people, underdeveloped economy and culture, and significant imbalances in development, it is worth objectively and calmly exploring what educational strategy to adopt to adapt to the process of modernization construction, based on our national conditions. I believe:

	(1) We must adhere to the socialist direction of education, taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposition of "education should face modernization, the world, and the future" as the overall guiding ideology for the development and reform of education in the new era of socialist modernization construction in China. We must carry out a relatively thorough and step-by-step reform in educational ideology, structure, content, methods, and management system, so as to steadily transition to the track of modern education (i.e., education that adapts to modernization construction) in a short period of time.

	(2) In the model of educational development, we must combine the "small pagoda" and the "big pagoda," and combine the cultivation of talents with the improvement of the nation's ideological and cultural quality. The "small pagoda" refers to the regular school education system, and the "big pagoda" refers to various forms of mass education system. We should prioritize the development of the "small pagoda" and strive to improve the quality of education in the "small pagoda," while also doing everything possible to promote the development and improvement of the "big pagoda" through the "small pagoda." In a country with 1.1 billion people and a backward economy and culture, the development of education can only adopt this model of "walking on two legs." If we only focus on regular school education and neglect or even exclude various forms of mass education, or if we use the model of regular school education to demand various forms of mass education, the path of education will be narrow. Even if we expend all our efforts, it will be difficult to improve the nation's cultural quality and meet the requirements of modernization construction after several years.

	(3) We should open up more paths to learning and more avenues for talent. In the layout of cultivating talents, we should form a situation where school education, on-the-job training, and self-study for success, utilizing the advantages of modern information and knowledge dissemination, stand on an equal footing. We should cultivate talents in an unrestricted manner and select talents in an unrestricted manner.

	(4) In cultivating talents, we must pay great attention to the unity of basic qualities and professional expertise. We should combine patriotism and socialism education with national conditions education, so that students strive to build a solid foundation in both theory and practice. Basic qualities include morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics, and this foundation must be laid in primary and secondary education. Contemporary primary and secondary education is essentially the basic quality education for builders of socialist modernization. Moral education should emphasize basic moral education, intellectual education should emphasize basic intellectual education (especially basic knowledge and basic training education), and physical education should emphasize education to enhance physical fitness. Professional expertise education can be better carried out on this basis. Neglecting basic quality education and pursuing high admission rates is a common problem in past primary and secondary education. The weak situation of ideological and political work in the entire education sector urgently needs to be changed.

	(5) The educational structure should adapt to the actual needs of different levels and types of talents in the process of socialist modernization construction. This educational structure is not fixed and unchangeable, but should be adjusted in a timely manner according to the actual needs of different periods. On the basis of universalizing compulsory education, according to China's actual situation, in the next period of time, the educational structure should shift to vocational and technical education as the main focus and to junior and senior levels as the main focus. The focus of education should be shifted downwards, that is, with compulsory education as the foundation and junior and senior vocational and technical education as the focus, and steadily develop higher professional education and graduate education. It may be more appropriate to adopt such a policy in the educational structure. We should take various effective measures to change the social psychology of neglecting junior and senior vocational and technical education and blindly pursuing higher education. To effectively cultivate the various construction talents needed in rural areas, we should consider establishing a vocational and technical education system for the local rural areas based on specialized regions.

	(6) We should accelerate the construction of a continuing education (lifelong education) system that suits China's characteristics and actual needs. China's continuing education will have a dual nature of knowledge updating and remedial education for a relatively long period of time, and neither should be neglected. We should establish a continuing education network with various forms, levels, and channels, such as on-the-job training, correspondence courses, short-term schools (training classes), and self-study, to cover the education of adults. Learning what is needed for the job, supplementing what is lacking, and continuously absorbing new knowledge are the distinctive features of continuing education, and it is not appropriate to use the school-running method of regular academic education for young people.

	(7) The key to educational success lies in teachers. Teacher education is the "mother industry" of the educational industry, and we must firmly adhere to the policy of prioritizing development and ensuring quality. We must take practical and effective measures every year to improve teachers' social status and quality, improve teachers' living conditions and working environment, and strive for significant improvements by the end of the century after ten years of effort.

	(8) We should mobilize the whole society to care for and support education, and vigorously promote various educational undertakings. We should raise funds for education through multiple channels, levy education taxes, and gradually increase the state's investment in education year by year. From a long-term and fundamental perspective, investing in education is the most profitable investment for the whole society, and wasting talents is the greatest waste of all. The modern social utilitarian view should be reconstructed with education and talents as the fulcrum, eliminating the influence of short-sightedness and short-term behavior.

	The above views are rather shallow, and I would like to hear your opinions. In short, education can either prosper a nation or ruin it. If the education issue is not properly addressed, it will be impossible for the Chinese nation to change its backward situation. Among the concerns for the country and the people, a particularly prominent issue is the concern for education. The prosperity of education means the stability of the nation's foundation, and the fate of achieving the Four Modernizations and revitalizing China lies in it.

    兴教八议
    敢峰
    要振兴中华，一个严重的问题摆在面前：必须促进整个民族在教育问题上的觉醒。
    九年制义务教育是我国整个教育事业的基础工程。它决定着在社会主义现代化建设进程中我中华民族的思想、文化素质，也是大批人才赖以健康成长的“苗圃”。实现四化，振兴中华，非把九年制义务教育抓好不可。没有人民群众的知识化就没有四个现代化，如日月行空其理至明，可惜人们往往像被浮云遮住了眼睛，看不明白。对于高等教育的发展，情况要好一些，但也不如人意。如果一方面对现代化建设急于求成，一方面又对教育重视不够，从总体战略上说，犹如飞机起飞，忽视修跑道而急于冲向蓝天，是不可能取得成功的。这种被教育拖后腿的滞后效应，在我国社会主义现代化建设中，已经日益明显地暴露出来。当然，我们不是说等教育抓上去了再来进行社会主义现代化建设，这也是不可能的，重要的问题是要正确地处理好现代化建设同发展教育的辩证关系。特别是在我们这样一个11亿人口的经济、文化不发达而发展又很不平衡的大国，从我国的国情出发，在发展教育上究竟采取什么战略，以便同现代化建设的进程相适应，很值得作客观冷静的探讨。我以为：
    （一）要坚持教育的社会主义方向，把邓小平同志提出的“教育要面向现代化、面向世界、面向未来”作为我国社会主义现代化建设新时期教育发展和改革的总的战略指导思想，使长期落后于现代化建设的传统教育，从教育思想、教育结构、教育内容和方法到办学体制来一个比较彻底而又有步骤的改革，以期能够在不长的时间内稳妥地转到现代教育（即与现代化建设相适应的教育）的轨道上来。
    （二）在教育发展的模式上，要把“小宝塔”和“大宝塔”结合起来，把培养人才和提高全民族的思想、文化素质结合起来。“小宝塔”指正规的学校教育系统，“大宝塔”指各种形式的全民教育系统。优先发展“小宝塔”和致力于提高“小宝塔”的教育质量，并同时千方百计用“小宝塔”带动“大宝塔”的发展和提高。在11亿人口的经济、文化落后的大国，发展教育只能采取这种“两条腿走路”的模式。只重视正规的学校教育而忽视甚至排斥各种形式的全民教育，或者用正规的学校教育的模式来要求各种形式的全民教育，办教育的路就会很窄，即使花尽了气力，再过若干年也难以提高全民族的文化素质和适应现代化建设的要求。
    （三）广开学路，广开才路。在培养人才的布局上，要形成学校教育、在职培训和利用现代信息、知识传播的有利条件鼓励自学成才三足鼎立的局面。不拘一格培养人才，不拘一格选用人才。
    （四）培养人才要十分重视基本素质与业务专长的统一。要把爱国主义、社会主义教育同国情教育结合起来，使学生努力打好理论与实践两个根基。基本素质包括德、智、体、美诸方面，这个基础一定要在中小学教育阶段打好。当代的中小学教育，实质上应是社会主义现代化建设者的基本素质教育，德育要重基本品德教育，智育要重基本智能教育（其中特别是基础知识和基本训练教育），体育要重增强体质的教育。业务专长的教育在这个基础上才能更好地展开。忽视基本素质教育而片面追求升学率，是过去中小学教育的一个通病。在整个教育工作中，思想政治工作薄弱的状况亟待改变。
    （五）教育结构要适应社会主义现代化建设进程对不同层次、不同类别人才的实际需要。这种教育结构不是固定的、一成不变的，而应根据不同时期的实际需要适时进行调整。在普及义务教育的基础上，根据我国的实际情况，在今后一个时期内，教育结构应转向职业技术型为主和中、初级为主。教育的重心要下移，即以义务教育为基础，以中、初级职业技术教育为重心，稳步发展高等专业教育和研究生教育。在教育结构上采取这样的方针可能是比较适宜的。要采取多种有效措施，改变轻视中、初级职业技术教育而盲目攀高的社会心理。为有效地培养农村所需要的各种建设人才，应考虑以专区为单位建立面向本地区农村的职业技术教育体系。
    （六）加快构筑适合我国特点和实际需要的继续教育（终身教育）体制。我国的继续教育，在一个较长时期内将兼有知识更新和补课教育的两重性，不可偏废。建立岗位培训、函授、短期学校（培训班）和自学等多种形式、多种层次、多种渠道的继续教育网络，形成对成年人的教育覆盖。干什么学什么，缺什么补什么，以及不断吸收新知识，这是继续教育的显著特点，不宜套用青少年正规的学历教育制度那种办学方式。
    （七）教育大计，教师为本。师范教育是教育产业中的“母机工业”，要坚定不移地采取优先发展和确保质量的方针。对提高教师的社会地位和素质，改善教师的生活待遇和工作条件，年年要有切实有效的措施，积十年之努力，以期到本世纪末能有一个大的改观。
    （八）动员全社会关心和支持教育，大力兴办各种教育事业。多渠道筹集教育经费，开征教育税，并逐年努力增加国家对教育的投资。从长远和根本的意义上说，全社会对教育的投资是一切投资中赢利最大的投资，对人才的浪费是一切浪费中最大的浪费。现代的社会功利观要以教育和人才为支点加以重构，排除目光短浅和短期行为的影响。
    以上粗浅看法，是否有当，请大家指教。总之，教育可以兴邦，也可以误国，教育问题不解决好，我们中华民族要改变落后的状况是不可能的。忧国忧民，其中一个十分突出的问题是要忧教。教育兴则国本固，实现四化、振兴中华之命运系焉。
