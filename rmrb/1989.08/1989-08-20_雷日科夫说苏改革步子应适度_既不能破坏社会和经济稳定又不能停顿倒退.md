Ryzhkov Says Soviet Reforms Should Be Moderate

Both Social and Economic Stability Should Be Maintained, and Reforms Should Not Be Halted or Reversed

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Ryzhkov, believes that the pace of Soviet reforms should be moderate, maintaining both social and economic stability while avoiding any halt or reversal.

The Soviet weekly "Arguments and Facts" published his remarks on August 18.

He believes that the main mistake during his tenure was the overly complacent assessment of the results of the first two years of the current five-year plan. After seeing the success of the economic accounting experiment, he lacked a thorough and detailed consideration of the consequences of nationwide reform implementation.

In evaluating the current stage of the Soviet economy, Ryzhkov said, "We are moving towards a socialist market through a complex path. The situation is very unfavorable, with enterprises and residents having more money than goods and commodities. To restore the balance of the national economy, it is necessary to reduce the budget deficit."

He also revealed that the government is drafting five laws: the law on property, the law on leasing, the unified tax law, the land law, and the enterprise law.

    雷日科夫说苏改革步子应适度
    既不能破坏社会和经济稳定又不能停顿倒退
    新华社莫斯科8月18日电  苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫认为，苏联改革的步子应适度，既不能破坏社会和经济的稳定，又不能停顿倒退。
    苏联《论据与事实》周报18日发表了他的谈话。
    他认为他任职期间的主要错误是对本五年计划头两年的执行结果产生了太平无事的错觉，在看到经济核算试点成功后，对改革在全国推广的后果缺乏深入周密的考虑。
    雷日科夫在评价现阶段苏联经济时说：“我们通过复杂的道路走向社会主义市场。形势很不利，企业和居民的钱比物资和商品多。要恢复国民经济平衡，必须减少预算赤字。”
    他还透露，政府正在起草所有制法、租赁法、统一税制法、土地法和企业法等5个法律。
