    中美共同开拓复印机业务
    沪施乐公司确立长期合作目标
    本报讯　记者曹瑞天报道：中美合资的上海施乐复印机有限公司确立长期合作目标，重视引进先进技术和先进管理，积极开拓业务，今年上半年的复印机销售量名列全国复印机公司的首位。
    这家公司是由久负盛名的美国施乐公司和上海申贝办公机械公司、交通银行上海分行合资兴办的一家高技术企业，合同期定为30年。这是美国在上海投资额最大的工业性项目。
    这家合资企业十分重视组织引进先进技术和先进管理。开业一年多来，他们已制定了数以百计的决策程序，使各项工作都有明确的依据；通过财务管理，对企业全面实施控制，形成一套科学管理方法；大力推行计算机管理，并应用到生产制造、工程技术、国产化、财务、市场等各个部门。去年，该公司被美国施乐公司派出的财务检查组的专家们打了A级评分。
    据美方人士透露，他们对与中方合作前景抱有很大期望，认为中国有很大的市场。美国施乐公司在130多个国家和地区设有子公司，认为中国是一块必争之地，又是一个生产成本较低的制造复印机理想场所。因此，他们在上海施乐公司投资总额达3000万美元，占投资比例一半以上。
