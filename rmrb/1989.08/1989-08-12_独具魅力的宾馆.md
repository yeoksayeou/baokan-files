Over the past eight years, the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, has been consistently ranked as the "World's Best Hotel" by the authoritative American magazine *International Investor*.

The meticulous and thoughtful service is undoubtedly one of the key reasons for the Oriental Hotel's global fame. For instance, a British man who visited Thailand after nearly 30 years expressed his nostalgia for the old days when he used to sleep under a mosquito net. The hotel promptly arranged for a mosquito net to be installed in his air-conditioned room. A New York businessman, a frequent guest, is always accommodated on the second floor in a room convenient for going up and down stairs whenever he arrives on a Friday—because, for religious reasons, he does not take the elevator on Fridays...

The Oriental Hotel's rich Eastern charm makes it uniquely attractive. Apart from the solemn Turkish carpets, elegant Japanese wallpaper, exquisite Thai rosewood furniture, and round sofas adorned with Southeast Asian jungle scenery, each guest room is decorated with fresh Thai flowers (the hotel spends $324,000 annually on flowers) and a table laden with a variety of tropical fruits (fruits are changed daily). This gives visitors a sense of being in an exotic Eastern land. At sunset, guests flock to the terrace to gaze at the Mekong River flowing gently through the city, sipping Thai tea. The vibrant sails and the long whistles of ships remind you: this is not London, New York, Beijing, or Tokyo, but the unique Bangkok.

Gourmets from abroad can also indulge in a feast at the hotel. The hotel's six restaurants employ hundreds of skilled chefs specializing in Eastern and Western cuisines. The most famous is the rooftop restaurant serving French cuisine, headed by the renowned French chef McCall. This chef is always striving for perfection, visiting famous restaurants around the world every year to learn new techniques and adding new delicacies to the menu. Travelers who enjoy sightseeing can take one of the hotel's two luxurious yachts upstream along the river to visit the ruins of the ancient Thai capital. Those who love fitness can go to the Thai-style gym to learn boxing. Female travelers eager to shop can find a variety of Thai goods in the hotel's 21 specialty stores, from sapphires to silk...

The hotel also places great importance on training new and old employees to continuously improve service quality. Currently, the hotel has 980 employees, with an annual training budget of $118,600. New employees start by learning from their mentors how to remove stains from carpets, how to fold cocktail napkins, how to arrange flowers, and how to politely handle grumpy or eccentric guests. All room attendants, cleaners, receptionists, and accountants must take English classes, with a particular focus on vocabulary related to their work. Statistics show that 73% of the hotel's employees have worked there for more than five years. They are among the highest-paid workers in Thailand, with the lowest monthly salary being $455—equivalent to the monthly salary of a relatively high-ranking government official.

    独具魅力的宾馆
    唐若水
    在过去的8年中，泰国曼谷的东方宾馆年年都被美国权威的《国际投资家》杂志评选为“世界第一宾馆”。
      “细致入微”的周到服务无疑是东方宾馆名扬天下的重要原因。如有位隔了近30年后再次访问泰国的英国人怀旧地说，他想“重温”昔日睡在蚊帐里的乐趣，宾馆即派人购了一顶安在这位先生设有空调的房间里。一位纽约商人是宾馆的常客，每当星期五到达宾馆时就被安排在二楼一间上下楼很方便的房间里——因为出于宗教原因他星期五不乘电梯……
    浓烈的东方色彩使东方宾馆独具东方式的魅力。且不说庄严的土耳其地毯、典雅的日本墙布、精致的泰国红木家具和画有东南亚丛林风光的圆沙发，单单每间客房内都布置有泰国鲜花（宾馆每年买花就耗资高达324000美元）和摆满餐桌的五花八门的热带水果（水果每日一换）就令旅客顿生进入东方异域之感。日落时分，旅客们纷纷登上阳台，一边眺望湄南河河水悠悠流淌穿过城区，一边呷着泰国茶，鲜艳的帆影和悠长的汽笛使你想起：这不是伦敦、纽约，也不是北京、东京，而是别具一格的曼谷。
    来自异国的美食家们也可在宾馆大饱口福。宾馆的六个饭店拥有数百名技艺高超的专做东方菜和西餐的大厨师，其中专营法国菜的楼顶餐厅最为著名，由法国名厨麦卡尔掌勺。此君对技艺精益求精，每年都要去世界各地的大餐厅“取经”，不断把新设计的珍馔佳肴添进菜单。喜欢观光的旅客，可乘坐宾馆拥有的两艘豪华游艇沿河逆流而上参观泰国故都的遗址。迷恋健身运动的旅客，可去泰国式的健身中心学打泰拳。热心采购的女旅客则可在宾馆所设的21家特色商店购买到种种泰国货，从蓝宝石到丝绸应有尽有……
    宾馆还十分重视对新老雇员的培训以使服务质量不断提高。目前，宾馆共有雇员980人，年培训费总额高达118600美元。到宾馆就职，新手们开始在师傅的指导下学习如何清除地毯上的污渍，如何叠鸡尾酒餐巾，如何插花，如何礼貌地对付牢骚满腹的“难缠”或“古怪”的客人。所有的客房服务员、清洁工、招待员、记帐员都须上英语课，特别注重学习与工作有关的词汇。据统计，宾馆73％的雇员在宾馆工作已超过5年，他们属泰国薪水最高的工人，月薪最低的也有455美元——这已相当一个较高级别的政府工作人员的月薪。
