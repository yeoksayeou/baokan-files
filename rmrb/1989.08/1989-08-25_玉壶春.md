	Jade Flask Spring
	Li Qing

	Not long ago, Wang Shisan went to the United States to participate in the International Chinese Snuff Bottle Society. Before his departure, I asked him what new works he would be taking with him. He took out two exquisite long boxes, on the milky white satin surface of which were placed 12 oval-shaped crystal snuff bottles, each depicting the portraits of Chinese emperors from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Each one was transparent and radiant; the brushwork was ancient and fluid, the lines were a harmonious blend of strength and softness; the colors were elegant and harmonious, and the figures were lifelike. On the back of each portrait, different symbolic objects of the respective dynasties were painted. I compared the color photographs of this series of snuff bottles with the color photographs of his previous works, "Portraits of Qing Dynasty Empresses" and "Portraits of U.S. Presidents," and found that there had been significant artistic progress.

	The art of painting inside snuff bottles combines the delicate and exquisite form of art with the national style of Chinese painting and calligraphy, integrating the essence of various Chinese crafts. It is as small as an egg, with a mouth as small as a soybean. After being specially ground and expanded with a grinding tool, various fine brushes made of bamboo, willow, and hair, as thin as horsehair, are inserted into the small mouth, and the artist carefully paints on the inner wall. Because the inner wall of the snuff bottle has a fine sand-like slope, it is not like painting on a flat piece of paper. Moreover, since the snuff bottle is painted from the reverse side and the image appears on the front side, the difficulty is further increased. When outlining and coloring, even a slight mistake will result in a flawed or ruined work, and all previous efforts will be in vain.

	Contemporary Chinese snuff bottle painting is divided into four major schools: Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, and Guangdong. The "Hebei School" originated later, but because of its novel and beautiful shapes, rich line work, wide range of subjects, and elegant colors, it is highly favored by collectors and connoisseurs from various countries. Its founder is Wang Shisan, known as the "master of craftsmanship."

	Wang Shisan has been in the art for 30 years and has his own distinct style. He does not complain when wronged, nor does he lose heart when faced with setbacks. He persistently pursues art, just as he wrote in his poem: "Within the small snuff bottle, I pour my blood to paint the universe. After thirty years of painting, I only wish for the spring of the jade flask."

    玉壶春
    李清
    前不久王习三赴美国参加了国际中国烟壶学会。临行时，我问及此行带去什么新作？他取出两个精制的长盒，在乳白色的缎面上，一溜儿放着12个椭圆形的水晶烟壶，分别绘有从夏、商、周开始，到元、明、清为止的中国历代君王肖像。个个色泽透明，熠熠生辉；笔锋古朴流利，线条刚柔相济；设色浑雅，人物逼真。在每个肖像的背面，分别画着不同朝代的象征物。我将这套系列烟壶的彩照，同他以前绘画的《清代皇后肖像》和《美国历代总统肖像》彩照互相比较，发现艺术上很有进展。
    内画烟壶，是把小巧玲珑的造型艺术与民族风格的书画艺术溶于一炉，聚中国多种工艺之大成。它体微似鸡蛋，口小如黄豆，经特制磨具钻磨开拓内壁后，再用竹、柳、毛多种细如马尾丝的勾笔，伸进小口径胃之内，精心在内壁穿插使用。因烟壶内壁有细砂形态的坡坎，比不得在平面纸上作画，况且内画壶是反面落笔，正面显像，更增加了难度。勾线和着色时，稍有不慎，便会误划或走笔，前功尽弃。
    当代中国的内画烟壶，分为京、冀、鲁、粤四大流派。“冀派”起源较晚，但由于它造型新颖美观，线描丰富，题材广泛，设色典雅，甚得各国收藏家、鉴赏家喜爱。它的创始人，便是被称作“鬼斧神工”的王习三。
    王习三从艺30年，自有其鲜明性格。他蒙冤不抱怨，受挫不坠志，执著地追求艺术，正如他写的诗：“方寸烟壶内，呕血绘乾坤。丹青三十载，唯愿玉壶春。”
