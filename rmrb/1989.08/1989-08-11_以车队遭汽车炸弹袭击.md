An Israeli convoy was attacked by a car bomb in southern Lebanon on August 9. A Shiite Muslim from Lebanon drove a car loaded with explosives into the convoy, injuring five Israeli soldiers and one Lebanese militiaman. This was in retaliation for Israel's abduction of Hezbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Mousawi.

According to a spokesman for the Beirut police, the incident occurred at around 9:30 a.m. local time on a road between the southern Lebanese towns of Marjayoun and Qlaileh, about 8 kilometers north of the Israeli border.
