    The 18,000-Kilometer Coastline Calls for a Green Barrier
    – A Comprehensive Overview of Coastal Protection Forest Systems
    By Cao Ruitian and An Zizhen, People's Daily Reporters

    The winding coastline stretches from the mouth of the Yalu River in Liaoning to the Beilun River Valley in Guangxi, spanning over 18,000 kilometers. Along this coastline, there are 195 counties covering 25.1 million hectares, stretching across 11 provinces and municipalities. This crescent-shaped golden belt, which accounts for only 2.6% of the country's land area, is home to 10% of the nation's population and generates billions of yuan in annual output.

    Nature’s Retribution is Creeping In
    Facing the rolling waves of the sea and the vibrant coastal economic development zones, the 18,000-kilometer coastline appears surprisingly devoid of greenery. Although efforts have been made over the years to establish some protective forests, the overall situation is fragmented, with no coherent network or belt formation. Moreover, poor management has led to a deteriorating ecological environment, and nature’s retribution is already upon us!

    Currently, the original forests in these areas have been almost completely destroyed, and the secondary forests have been severely degraded due to repeated indiscriminate logging. Bare hills and barren mountains are increasing daily, and some regions are even facing the threat of red desertification. Vegetation protection is dwindling, with soil erosion affecting nearly 6 million hectares, accounting for over 40% of the coastal region's forestry land. Due to the unique climate and frequent natural disasters in this crescent-shaped region, the average annual direct economic losses from typhoons, heavy rains, floods, sandstorms, hail, and low temperatures amount to nearly 3 billion yuan.

    Quickly Build a Green Barrier
    In the face of natural disasters, the presence or absence of protective forests makes a significant difference. According to a report from the East China Forestry Survey and Design Institute of the State Forestry Administration, in regions where a protective forest system has been initially established, the crop lodging rate is reduced by 70%, rice yields increase by more than 15%, and fruit drop rates decrease by more than 60%. If a protective forest system is established along the coast, the severity of natural disasters can be reduced by 30%, bringing an economic benefit of 8.8 billion yuan, and the self-sufficiency rate of timber can be increased by more than 100%.

    The construction of a green barrier along the 18,000-kilometer coastline, as a major national ecological project, has finally been implemented before and after the Tree Planting Festival this year. The first phase of the project, covering 2.49 million hectares, is scheduled for completion by the end of the century. After completion, the forest coverage rate in the entire coastal region will increase from the current 24.9% to 34.8%. In the first decade of the 21st century, a second phase of the project will be carried out, adding another 1.07 million hectares of afforestation.

    The State Forestry Administration has listed the coastal protective forest system alongside the world-renowned "Three-North" protective forest, the water and soil conservation forests in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the vast plain greening network as one of the four major forestry construction projects in China by the end of the century. The scale and long-term benefits of this project are comparable to any major engineering project in the world!

    Challenges from the Ocean
    The strategic significance of the coastal protective forest system goes far beyond forestry itself.

    Over the past two decades, countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific have been competing to establish economic open zones along their coasts, absorbing foreign technology and capital like sponges, and entering the international market with an aggressive posture. The economic growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region is nearly double the world average. Even the United States and the Soviet Union have had to adopt the stance of "Pacific nations" to welcome the arrival of the "Pacific era."

    As a Pacific nation, China naturally occupies an important position in the Pacific circle. Our vast coastline is a window to the world, a starting line for going global, and a frontier for reform, opening up, and revitalization. Over the past decade, this golden coastline has seen the emergence of the four economic special zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen, followed by the opening of fourteen coastal cities and Hainan Island, and the rise of economic open zones in the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and the Minnan-Xiamen-Quanzhou-Zhangzhou Triangle. These developments have been unstoppable, like bamboo shoots after rain.

    To build a developed economic open zone, a good ecological environment is indispensable. Building coastal protective forests is precisely about improving the ecological environment, conserving and protecting national resources, and providing a green barrier for the development of the coastal economy. This will create a favorable environment for attracting foreign investment and technology, and even for developing tourism and promoting international exchanges—a long-term strategy with immeasurable economic, social, and ecological benefits.

    Slow but Steady
    Although the grand project cannot be completed overnight, it has already begun. As long as afforestation continues, the prospects are very promising.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic, the coastal people have created farmland forest networks and greened barren mountains and islands, planting over 80 million mu of trees, with a living stock of over 100 million cubic meters. However, the proportion of young and middle-aged forests is as high as 90%. The per-unit stock volume is still lower than the national average, and there are many sparse and fragmented forests, with monotonous tree species. In most regions, forestry has stagnated at the level of the 1970s. The slow progress of coastal forestry has many lessons:

    – The construction of protective forests has long been in a state of no planning, no investment, and no system. Short-term behavior that prioritizes immediate economic benefits while neglecting long-term comprehensive benefits is widespread. Many places prefer to wait for disaster relief rather than invest in afforestation. Those who invest in afforestation do not benefit, and those who benefit do not invest in afforestation, suppressing local enthusiasm for afforestation.

    – Local forestry construction is fragmented, lacking unified leadership and comprehensive planning, resulting in fragmented forest land and an incomplete network, failing to form a cohesive whole.

    – Forestry organizations are weak, with insufficient personnel, and local legal awareness is weak, leading to frequent incidents of forest destruction and theft.

    Learning from these lessons, we should also recognize the favorable conditions: the coastal region has superior natural conditions, with high temperatures, abundant rainfall, and ample light and heat, which coincide with the high-temperature growth period of trees; there are over 200 species of woody plants, and more than 2,000 species of grasses and shrubs. The entire region has 56.19 million mu of various types of suitable land for afforestation, along with over 30 years of experience in protective forest construction, technical conditions, and labor, capital, and other material foundations. It is entirely possible to erect a green barrier along the 18,000-kilometer coastline. We are not afraid of slow progress, only of standing still. With the spirit of moving mountains, as long as we continue afforestation, the 18,000-kilometer coastline will surely stand a green barrier.

    万里海岸呼唤绿色屏障
　　——沿海防护林体系综述
    本报记者　曹瑞天　安子贞
    蜿蜒曲折的海岸，北起辽宁的鸭绿江口，南至广西的北仑河谷，全长18000多公里。沿海195个县占地2510万公顷，纵贯11个省区市，宛如一串明珠镶嵌在万里海岸。这块仅占国土面积2.6％的弧形黄金地带，生息着全国10％的人口，每年创造上千亿元产值。
    惩罚悄然袭来
    面对波涛起伏的大海和生机勃勃的沿海经济开放区，万里海岸却显得缺乏绿意。这里虽经各地多年努力，造成一些防护林，但总体上横不成网，纵不成带，更兼护理不善，生态环境在日益恶化，大自然的惩罚已经袭来！
    目前，这些地区原始森林几乎破坏殆尽，次生林也在周而复始的乱砍滥伐下残缺不全，荒山秃岭与日俱增，个别地区面临着红沙漠的威胁。植被保护在锐减，水土流失面积近6000万亩，占沿海地区林业用地40％以上。由于这块弧形地带海陆交替，气候突变，没有林带防护，平均每年因台风、暴雨、洪涝、风沙、冰雹、低温等自然灾害侵袭造成的直接经济损失近30亿元。
    快建绿色屏障
    在自然灾害面前，有无防护林大不一样。据林业部华东林业调查规划设计院报告，在一些初步形成防护林体系的地区，农作物倒伏率比无林区少70％，水稻增产15％以上，果树落果率减少60％以上。如果沿海地区形成防护林体系，自然灾害程度可减轻30％，带来经济效益8.8亿元，木材自供能力可提高1倍以上。
      万里海岸建一座绿色屏障，作为国家一项重大生态工程，在今年植树节前后终于付诸实施。工程量达249万公顷的一期工程在本世纪末完成后，整个沿海地区的森林覆盖率可由现在的24.9％增至34.8％。到21世纪的前十年，还将进行第二期工程，继续造林107万公顷。
    林业部将沿海防护林体系与举世闻名的“三北”防护林、重振山河的长江中下游水土保持林、波澜壮阔的平原绿化网并列为本世纪末我国四大林业建设工程。其规模之宏伟，效益之深远，堪与世界上任何巨大的工程相媲美！
    挑战来自大洋
    沿海防护林体系，其战略意义远不止于林业本身。
    近二十年来，亚太国家和地区竞相在各自的海岸设置经济开放地带，像海绵般地充分吮吸着国外的技术和资本，以咄咄逼人的态势进入国际市场。亚太地区的经济增长率，差不多是世界平均经济增长率的两倍。连美国、苏联也不得不以“太平洋国家”的姿态，迎接“太平洋时代”的到来。
    中国作为太平洋国家，理所当然地处于太平洋圈里的重要位置。我国大陆漫长的海岸线是面向世界的窗口，也是走向世界的起跑线，更是改革、开放、搞活的前沿地带。十年来，在这块黄金海岸上，从深圳、珠海、汕头和厦门四个经济特区的应运而生，到沿海十四个城市和海南岛的相继开放，直到珠江三角洲、长江三角洲和闽南厦漳泉三角地区经济开放区的崛起，如雨后春笋，势不可当。
    要建设发达的经济开放区，没有良好的生态环境是不可思议的。建设沿海防护林，正是在改善生态环境，治理保护国土资源，为沿海经济发展提供绿色屏障，从而创造吸引外资和技术的良好环境，乃至发展旅游，增进对外交往的百年大计。其经济效益、社会效益和生态效益难以估量。
    不怕慢只怕站
    宏伟的工程，虽非朝夕可成，但毕竟已经起步，只要造林不止，前景十分可观。
    建国以来，沿海人民营造农田林网，绿化荒山海岛，已栽种8000多万亩林木，成活林木蓄积量逾1亿立米。但中幼林比重高达90％。单位蓄积量还低于全国平均水平，加上疏残林多，林种单调，大部分地区林业徘徊在70年代基础上。沿海林业进展缓慢，自然有许多教训：
    ——防护林建设长期处于无计划、无投资、无体系状态。只重眼前经济收益，忽视长远综合效益的短期行为普遍存在。许多地方宁愿坐等救灾补助，而不愿投资造林。掏钱造林的不受益，受益的不掏钱造林，压抑了地方造林的积极性。
    ——地方林业建设各自为政，缺乏统一领导和全面规划，造成林地断带、破网，形不成整体。
    ——林业组织管理薄弱，人员不足，地方法制观念淡薄，毁林盗林现象屡禁不止。
    吸取教训，也应看到有利条件：沿海地区毕竟自然条件优越，高温多雨，光热充裕，与林木高温生长同期；树种极为丰富，仅乔木即逾200种，加上草类、灌木类超过2000种。全地区共有各类宜林地5619万亩，加上三十多年防护林建设经验、技术条件和劳力、资金等物质基础，在万里海岸上矗立起一座绿色屏障，是完全可以办到的。不怕慢，只怕站，只要以愚公移山的精神造林不止，万里海岸最终必会竖起一道绿色屏障。
