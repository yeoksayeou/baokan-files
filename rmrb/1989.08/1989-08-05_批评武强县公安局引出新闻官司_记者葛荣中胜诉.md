A media lawsuit that lasted for a year finally came to a conclusion on August 3: The People's Court of Chang'an District, Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, ruled to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the original plaintiff, former director of the Public Security Bureau of Wuqian County, Wang Jinshi, who accused Hebei People's Radio and reporter Ge Rongzhong of China Electric Power News of defaming his reputation and sought to restore his reputation and compensate for damages.

On the night of January 31, 1988, Sun Gengnian, director of the Electric Power Bureau of Wuqian County, and others went to Wangzhuang Village in the same county to inspect electricity theft. They were attacked by a group of villagers with bricks and fell unconscious on the spot. After the incident, the county public security authorities failed to handle the case properly. Ge Rongzhong, upon learning of this situation, conducted an in-depth investigation in Wuqian County and wrote a report titled "A Strange Incident in Wuqian County," criticizing the county public security bureau. On February 25 of the following year, Hebei People's Radio broadcasted this article. By the end of April, Wang Jinshi was removed from his position as director of the county public security bureau for other reasons and was appointed as the deputy director of the county political and legal affairs leading group with an equivalent rank. Wang Jinshi was very dissatisfied with this and believed that the critical report led to his removal. In August of that year, he filed a lawsuit with the court.

After winning the lawsuit, Ge Rongzhong did not feel relieved. He said with deep feelings, "Although this lawsuit was won, the energy spent was too much! It can be seen how difficult it is to implement public opinion supervision!"

    批评武强县公安局引出新闻官司
    记者葛荣中胜诉
    新华社石家庄8月5日电　（记者杨树勋、于绍良）一场耗时1年的新闻官司8月3日终于有了结果：河北省石家庄市长安区人民法院开庭审理，依法驳回了原告、武强县原公安局局长王金志关于河北人民广播电台及中国电力报记者葛荣中侵害其名誉权，要求恢复名誉，赔偿损失的诉讼请求。
    1988年1月31日夜，河北省武强县电力局局长孙庚年等人到本县王庄村检查窃电情况，被一伙村民用砖头砸伤，当场昏倒在地。事发后，县公安机关对此案查处不力，葛荣中得悉这一情况后，深入武强县采访，写出一篇《武强县发生一件怪事》的报道，对县公安局提出了批评。去年2月25日，河北人民广播电台播出了这篇稿子。4月底，王金志因其他原因被免去县公安局局长职务，担任级别相当的县政法领导小组副组长。对此王金志十分不满，认为是批评报道导致他被免职。去年8月，他向法院提出诉讼。
    葛荣中在胜诉后并不感到轻松，他深有感触地说，这场官司虽然胜了，但耗费的精力也太大了，可见实施舆论监督有多难！
