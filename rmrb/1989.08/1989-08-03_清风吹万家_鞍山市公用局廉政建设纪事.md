The Anshan Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, responsible for the water supply, gas supply, and passenger transportation services for a population of one million in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, has been diligently providing services and maintaining integrity to foster a positive atmosphere. The people of the steel city praise them for "blowing the breeze of integrity through every home."

The bureau has adopted a three-step approach to improve the quality of its workforce: compiling books, empathizing with users, and providing smiling services. They have written textbooks on "Professional Responsibility, Professional Ethics, and Professional Discipline" and a collection of exemplary stories from across the bureau titled "Spring Light Shines on Millions of Homes," printing and distributing over ten thousand copies to employees. They have also conducted phased training for employees. Subsequently, they organized discussions among employees on over two hundred questions such as "What if I were a user or a passenger?" and "What should I do if I were in this situation?" This has fostered a service-oriented mindset among employees, who now prioritize the needs and concerns of users. Over the past three years, they have performed over 32,000 good deeds for users and passengers, returned over 12,300 yuan in lost money, and returned over 1,000 lost items. They have received over 2,100 letters of commendation, 144 banners, and plaques.

Given the widespread and diverse nature of public utilities, the bureau established a user representative system in 1987. Two hundred and thirty-nine user representatives, selected by urban districts, streets, and residential committees, reflect the opinions and demands of users, provide suggestions for gas and water management and development, and report and stop any misconduct. Over the past two years, the bureau has received over five hundred suggestions and demands from user representatives and has responded to them in a manner satisfactory to the public. They have also implemented a system where the bureau director holds a dialogue with user representatives once a year, and company managers hold dialogues once a month. Today, user representatives have become a bridge and link between the enterprise and its users.

Regarding integrity, the bureau's leadership does not indulge in empty talk but leads by example. Last year, due to a shortage of gas supply, some restaurants had their gas supply cut off. One restaurant manager visited the director, Liang Moli, at his home in the evening, bringing meat and fabric as gifts, but was rejected and reprimanded. The leadership's refusal to accept bribes has set an example for the employees. Over the past three years, the bureau's employees have refused to accept over 15,000 yuan in cash, over 1,400 gifts, and declined over 1,000 invitations to meals. To ensure that integrity is effectively implemented, the bureau has established effective regulations. The design, installation, maintenance, construction, inspection, and billing of gas and water supply, as well as the management of urban passenger transportation, including the issuance and handling of taxi operating licenses, are all made public. When formulating various integrity regulations, they ensure that there is action behind every word. Regarding how to prevent extorting users, they have clearly stipulated: a demotion in salary for one year for the first offense, a demotion in rank for the second offense, and dismissal for the third offense. A deputy team leader in the Water Supply Company, under the pretext of purchasing water meters for a certain unit in Tianjin, rented an imported medium-sized passenger car at a cost of 2,830 yuan to the factory, taking his family to Beidaihe and Tianjin for a vacation. After the bureau's leadership investigated and confirmed the facts, they not only made the participants in the trip pay the full car fare but also demoted the deputy team leader in salary for one year, removed him from his position, and the party organization revoked his preliminary party membership status. The results of the handling were also publicly announced in the newspaper. Due to their strict enforcement of discipline without leniency, the industry's malpractices have been effectively curbed, and the number of disciplinary violations has been gradually reduced.

    清风吹万家
    ——鞍山市公用局廉政建设纪事
    王忠奇
    担负着辽宁省鞍山市一百万人口自来水、煤气、客运服务工作的鞍山市公共事业管理局，辛辛苦苦讲服务，清清白白树正气。钢城人民称赞他们“清廉之风吹万家”。
    编书育人——将心比心——微笑服务，这是该局提高职工队伍素质的三步曲。他们编写了《职业责任、职业道德、职业纪律》教科书，编写了反映全局各方面典型事迹的《春光洒向千万家》，印刷万余册发到职工手中，对职工分期分批培训。接着，在职工中开展“假如我是一个用户、一名乘客”，“要是我应该怎么办？”等二百多个问题的大讨论。从而在职工中树立起急用户之所急，想用户之所想的服务作风。三年来，他们为用户和乘客做好事三万二千多件，拾金不昧一万二千三百多元，各种物品交还失主一千多件。收到表扬信二千一百多封、锦旗牌匾一百四十四面。
    这个局根据公用事业点多、面广、线长、涉及千家万户的特点，于一九八七年建立了用户代表制度。由城区、街道、居委会推选产生的二百三十九名用户代表，反映用户的意见和要求，对供气、供水管理和发展提出建议，制止和举报违纪行为。两年来，全局共收到用户代表提出的各类意见与要求达五百多件，都作出了使群众比较满意的答复。他们还制定了局长一年与用户代表对话一次，各公司经理每月对话一次的制度。如今，用户代表已发展成为企业与用户之间的纽带和桥梁。
    对廉政问题，局领导不是沉醉于高谈阔论，而是从自身带头抓起。去年底，由于煤气气源紧张，停了部分饭店的煤气。某饭店经理晚上提着肉和布料，来到局长梁墨林家，不仅礼物被拒绝，还挨了一通“批”。领导不贪不占，职工竞相仿效。近三年来，全局职工拒收现金一万五千多元，拒收各种礼品一千四百多件，谢绝吃请一千多次。为了把廉政建设落到实处，这个局制定了行之有效的规章制度。对煤气、自来水的设计安装、维修、工程施工、验收、收费，对城市客运管理办理出租汽车营业执照、歇业和复业手续，全面公开其办事程序和办事结果。这个局在制定各项廉政纪律时，做到有雷必有雨。在如何杜绝拿卡要用户的问题上，明文规定：发现一次下浮一级工资一年；发现两次，降薪一级；发现三次，开除厂籍。自来水公司一名副队长以给某单位去天津买水表为名，让厂方花了二千八百三十元租一台进口中型客车，带着家属到北戴河、天津等地旅游。局领导查实后，不仅让参加旅游的人员承担全部车费，还下浮一级工资一年，免去了那名副队长的职务，党组织取消了其预备党员资格，并在报上公开处理结果。由于他们执行纪律不姑息迁就，行业歪风得到了有效制止，违纪现象逐年减少。
