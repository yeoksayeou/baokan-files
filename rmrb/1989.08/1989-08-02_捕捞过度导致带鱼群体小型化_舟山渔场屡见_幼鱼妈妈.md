Letter to the Editor:

In late June, four pairs of resource exploration fishing vessels organized by the East China Sea Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture captured several yellow croakers weighing less than 100 grams and measuring about 17 centimeters in length in the Zhoushan fishing grounds. These "baby momma fish" had significantly fewer and lower-quality eggs compared to mature "fish mommas." Some veteran fishermen who have weathered storms for decades expressed their astonishment, saying they had never seen such a phenomenon before.

To understand the cause, the author visited the Zhejiang Provincial Marine Fisheries Research Institute and consulted with experts such as Deputy Researcher Zhu Delin, the leader of the research group on the dynamics and management technology of the East China Sea yellow croaker resources. They believe that the main reason for this phenomenon is the previous years' lack of macro-control in fisheries production, where the fishing intensity far exceeded the resource regeneration capacity. To maintain the ecological balance of the population, the yellow croaker group was forced to mature early and accelerate generational reproduction, resulting in smaller sizes and younger ages.

Experts analyzed that in the early 1970s, one-year-old yellow croakers weighing 180 to 200 grams and measuring about 20 centimeters in length were just beginning to reach sexual maturity, with a spawning rate of only 50%. Now, not only do one-year-old fish spawn, but even 0.6-year-old young fish have started to spawn. This indicates that marine fishery resources and the ecological environment are undergoing a vicious cycle, ultimately leading to the extinction of this species on Earth.

The appearance of "baby momma fish" warns us that we must strictly enforce fishery regulations, rationally protect the environment, and maintain ecological balance, following the natural laws of marine resources for scientific production development. Experts urge: We must not overfish and consume the "future generations' food" any longer!

### 捕捞过度导致带鱼群体小型化  舟山渔场屡见“幼鱼妈妈”

    捕捞过度导致带鱼群体小型化
    舟山渔场屡见“幼鱼妈妈”
    6月下旬，农业部东海渔政分局组织的4对资源探捕渔轮，在舟山渔场捕获到不少体重不足100克、肛长仅17厘米左右的怀卵幼带鱼。这些“幼鱼妈妈”的怀卵数量和质量明显低于成熟的“鱼妈妈”。一些抗风搏浪几十年的老渔工感叹：这种怪现象从未见过。
    为弄清原因，笔者专程到浙江省海洋水产研究所，请教了东海群系带鱼资源变动和管理技术研究课题组组长、副研究员朱德林等专家。他们认为：出现这种现象，主要原因是前几年渔业生产宏观失控，捕捞强度大大超过资源再生能力。带鱼群体为维持其种群生态平衡，被迫提早性成熟，加速世代繁殖，由此造成小型化、低龄化。
    专家们分析，70年代初，体重180克至200克、肛长20厘米左右的一龄带鱼为初届性成熟，其产卵率只占50％。现在，不仅一龄鱼全部产卵，而且连0.6龄的幼鱼也开始产卵。这意味着海洋水产资源、生态环境均在发生恶性循环，最后将导致这一物种在地球上灭绝。
      “幼鱼妈妈”的出现，警告人们必须严格执行渔业法规，合理进行环境保护和维护生态平衡，遵照海洋资源自然规律科学发展生产。专家们疾呼：不能再酷渔滥捕，吃“子孙饭”了！
