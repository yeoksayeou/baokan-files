According to a sample survey conducted by the Political Research Office of the Ningling County Committee in Henan, the county's 28 administrative villages and 276 village groups, with a total population of 38,036 people, purchased a total of 175,513 yuan in national savings bonds from 1982 to 1988 over a span of 7 years. However, only 139,675 yuan, which is 79.6% of the amount purchased by farmers, has been distributed to them. As of now, 35,838 yuan has not yet been distributed to the people. Among the bonds that have not been distributed to households, 11,096 yuan is being held by the village committees and village groups, 22,873 yuan has been misappropriated, 1,139 yuan has been lent out, and 730 yuan has been lost. In one village, 3,585 yuan was deducted from the farmers' bonds over 6 years, but the purchased bonds were not distributed to the farmers. The village accountant said: "These national savings bonds are kept by the village as public accumulation." Regarding this, some villagers have said: "Every year we are told to buy national savings bonds, but we have never seen what they look like." China People's Bank, Shangqiu Branch, Henan Province

    买回国库券不如数发给农民
    据河南宁陵县委政研室抽样调查，该县28个行政村、276个村民组，38036人，自1982年至1988年的7年中，共购买国库券175513元，实际发给农民国库券139675元，占农民购买数的79.6％，至今有35838元仍未发给群众。在未发放到户的国库券中，村委、村民组保存的11096元，挪用的22873元，借出的1139元，丢失的730元。有一个村，6年扣农民国库券3585元，买的国库券却不发给农民。这个村的会计说：“这国库券是村作为公共积累留下的。”对此，有的群众提出：“每年都叫我们买国库券，国库券啥样都没见过。”中国人民银行河南商丘分行
