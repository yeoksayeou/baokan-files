Some say the ocean is generous, willing to offer without reservation all that people need; others say the ocean is an inexhaustible treasure trove, no matter how much people take from it, it will never diminish its wealth.

I have always held this view. However, after recently having the opportunity to conduct a short-term survey in the Bohai Sea, various large and small real-life examples have greatly changed my original perception. I discovered that the ocean is not as generous as people imagine; sometimes it can be a bit stingy and miserly. Things that you want to float to the surface don't always comply; things you want to catch may not come as you wish, and you might even have to pay a considerable price. For example, not far from the mouth of the Yalu River, in the sea south of Donggou County, Liaoning Province, there are certainly still remnants of the Qing Dynasty's Beiyang Fleet, including the warship Gaosheng and other ships sunk by the Japanese invaders nearly a century ago. However, according to local comrades familiar with the situation, relevant parties have been trying to salvage these items for several years but have found nothing. Perhaps the iron armor and wooden hulls are reluctant to part with the tragic souls of the defeated soldiers; perhaps the defeated soldiers are ashamed to let their remains surface and face future generations; or perhaps the ocean is too deep, making it stingy and unwilling to easily give up what it has taken in.

The ocean is even more "stingy" with those who toy with it. For example, at the marine aquaculture farm of the Shandong Changdao Fisheries Company, there are often incidents of people stealing abalone and scallops at night without doing any work. In response, the ocean sometimes isn't so accommodating. Not long ago, a sea thief was caught in a predicament: his diving suit got caught on a hook underwater, the more he struggled to free himself, the tighter it got. In the end, he lost both his stolen goods and his life. His accomplices on the surface, seeing that he didn't come up, had no choice but to flee. At this point, people jokingly commented: the ocean is "stingy" for a good reason!

The ocean is indeed vast, but it is not inexhaustible; the ocean seems very resilient, but in reality, it can be more delicate than land. Even if farmland is overworked, with proper rest or improvement, it can still produce good crops. However, if the ocean is over-exploited, it takes a long time to recover.

This time, I learned something that surprised me greatly: no wonder the price of sea fish is so high. The Bohai Bay, which used to be rich in yellow croaker and hairtail, now has almost none left underwater; as for the originally precious species like goldfish and red snapper (sablefish), they have become even rarer. In today's Chinese waters, only in the Zhoushan Archipelago fishing area of Zhejiang can relatively more hairtail and large yellow croaker be caught. To catch more, one has to venture into the open sea, brave the dangers, and sail thousands of miles to the Tsushima Strait, the Indian Ocean, and even West Africa and Alaska, catching and processing on the spot, selling locally, and bringing back considerable money, but not fish.

It is not an exaggeration to say that underwater resources are sounding the alarm of depletion! Seeking quick gains, competing for hunting, overloading fishing boats, and indiscriminately fishing without regard for growth patterns, intercepting mother fish laying eggs on their way to the fishing grounds; immature fry are also caught by impatient owners; highly efficient large trawl nets sweep the sea bottom, making the seabed as smooth as a courtyard; in the border areas of provinces, cities, and counties, there have been many disputes that are hard to resolve, sometimes making the fisheries administration very difficult.

People's pockets may be getting fuller, but the seabed is getting "cleaner." At this point, even if the ocean wants to be generous, it can't, and blaming it for being stingy would be a bit unfair.

The ocean also has dirty places, which are caused by human pollution. For example, Jinzhou Bay, Tanggu in Bohai Bay, and Laizhou Bay have long been known as the three major areas for razor clams, but a few years ago, Jinzhou Bay and Tanggu in Bohai Bay suffered from pollution, causing a large number of razor clams to die, and the production has almost ceased; Laizhou Bay followed closely, with ten million razor clams dying in one year, causing an economic loss of fifty million yuan.

Another stark contrast: the dirtier the seawater, the "cleaner" the fish, shrimp, shellfish, and algae in the sea. People's mouths and hands seem to be at odds; their mouths crave seafood, but their hands often do stupid things that send aquatic life to its doom.

It seems that only recently have people suddenly realized: the ocean has boundaries, human activities on this planet are limited; the ocean's abundance is also conditional, and if mishandled, it could become like the Ningguo Mansion in "Dream of the Red Chamber"; the ocean appears open-hearted and carefree on the surface, but in the realm of emotions, it can be as temperamental as Lin Daiyu, not tolerating even a hint of deceit.

However, ultimately, the ocean is forgiving. For thousands of years, it has buried many lonely souls in small boats, but it has also accommodated brave spirits, leaving behind their heroic songs, providing them with a permanent resting place;

The ocean is also willing to give. As long as people give it the basic respect and care, and be careful not to act against the rules.

The ocean also values spirit and morality. If people do not value spirit and reason with the ocean, it will not only be stingy but will also retaliate and punish.

The ocean may become richer, but it will not suddenly become a nouveau riche overnight.

A rich ocean is also a poor ocean!

### 海洋的吝啬

    海洋的吝啬
    石英
   有人说，大海是慷慨的，它愿将人们所需要的东西无私地奉献；有人说，大海是一个取之不尽的巨大宝库，无论人们怎样索求也不会稍减它的富有。
    我一向也是这样认为。但最近，当我有幸去渤海二水域作了短期考察后，一些大大小小的真实事例使我在很大程度上改变了固有的认识。我发现，海洋有时并不似人们想象的那么大方，甚至有点小气、抠门，你想让它自动浮至水面的东西它常常并不那么乖乖听话；想把你需要的东西抓上来也不一定如愿，甚至还要付出相当的代价。譬如说：在鸭绿江口外不远，辽宁省东沟县以南的大海中，肯定还沉埋着近一个世纪前清朝北洋水师的遗物——运兵船高升号和其它被日寇击沉的舰船残骸。但据当地熟悉情况的同志介绍：有关方面几年来曾着力打捞，却一无所获。铁甲和木壳也许是为了掩裹那些难以瞑目的悲壮军魂而不忍分离；败绩的官兵也许是羞于让残迹露面而愧对后世；更可能的是，大海过于深邃反而显得吝啬，不肯将它收纳的一切沉品轻易地吐出来。
    海洋对戏弄它的人当然更加“吝啬”。譬如说，在山东长岛渔业公司海珍养殖场，时不时地发生不劳而获者在夜间潜水偷窃鲍鱼和扇贝，对此，海洋有时也不那么好说话。不久前，就有一个窃海者正满心高兴时，不料潜水衣挂在水下的网钩上，越想挣脱挂得越紧，结果赔了窃物又折命，水上的同伙见他老不上来，也只好逃之夭夭。这时，人们就幽默地评论说：大海“小气”得好！
    海洋的确是巨大的，但却不是取之不尽用之不竭；海洋看来很“皮实”，实际上它有时比陆地还娇气，陆上的田地纵然种得过累，适当休息或经过整改还能长出好庄稼，海洋被作践得太苦之后，短时间很难再恢复元气。
    我这次才知道，知道时还大吃一惊：也难怪眼下海鱼的价格这么昂贵，过去盛产黄鱼、带鱼等普通鱼类的渤海湾，今天水下已濒临绝迹；至于本来就是名贵品种的金鲷、红鲷（加吉鱼），就更成为凤毛麟角了。在当今我国海域，只是在浙江舟山群岛渔区，还可捕获较多的带鱼和大黄鱼。要想更大量的捕捞，只能向远洋进发，不畏艰险，劈风斩浪，涉行千万里去对马海峡、印度洋以至西非和阿拉斯加，现捕现加工，当地销售，带回来的是可观的钱，也不可能是鱼。
    说水下发出资源枯竭的警报，这绝不是危言耸听！急功近利，竞相争猎，超负荷地添造渔船，不顾生长规律地梳篦式捕捞，使游动中奔赴渔场撒子的母鱼横遭拦截；未长成的幼仔也被性急的主人请进网中；功效极高的大拖网搜来刮去，使海底的泥沙也拉成平整的场院；在省区县区毗邻交界处，也发生过许多咬不清扯不明的纠纷，有时弄得渔政方面也很为难。
    人的兜囊里虽然越来越鼓，但海底却越来越“干净”，这时想大方也大方不了，再怪它吝啬它便有点冤枉。
    海洋也有不干净处，那是人为的污染所致。譬如：锦州湾、渤海湾的塘沽和莱州湾历来被称为三大毛蚶产地，而前几年，锦州湾、渤海湾的塘沽因污染造成毛蚶大批死亡，已基本上形不成产量；莱州湾紧随其后，一年间毛蚶死亡十万吨，经济损失五千万元。
    又是一个大反差：海水越不干净，海里的鱼、虾、贝、藻越“干净”。人们的口和手有点作对，嘴里渴望着吃到海鲜产品，可手上又往往干了些把水族送上绝路的蠢事。
    好像直到最近人们才突然醒悟：海洋是有边的，人的活动在我们这个星球上是有限的；海洋的富足也是有条件的，弄不好也可能成为《红楼梦》里的宁国府；海洋表面看来胸怀开阔，满不在乎，其实在感情天地上有时就像林妹妹那么小性儿，还容不得半点虚假。
    然而，归根结底，海洋还是宽容的，千百年来，它固然也埋葬了许多孤舟哀魂，但也容纳了义勇之躯，留下了他们的慷慨悲歌，为他们提供了永久的安身之地；
    海洋还是乐于奉献的，只要人们给予起码的尊重与爱护，当心不要有悖规律行事。
    海洋也讲精神也讲道德，假如人对它不讲精神不讲道理，它不仅吝啬，还会报复与惩罚哩。
    海洋还有可能变得更富足，但肯定不会在一夜间成为暴发户。
    富足的海洋，也是贫困的海洋！
