A 25-year-old individual entrepreneur, Yuan Jiesheng from Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, evaded 380,000 yuan in state taxes and became a wealthy individual. How was he able to get away with his illegal activities? One significant reason is that some officials in state-owned and collective enterprises, who hold the power over financial and material resources, accepted his bribes and provided him with hundreds of thousands of yards of cloth for resale, as well as fake receipts to evade taxes. It was found that seven supply units' clerks alone accepted over 70,000 yuan in bribes from Yuan.

Using money to bribe and win over "public officials," to smooth the way and pave the path, in order to exploit the state and make more profits, is not a tactic invented by Yuan Jiesheng, nor is it an isolated incident. Many individual business owners can quickly amass wealth through illegal operations and tax evasion, often using this very method.

What is heartbreaking is that there are indeed some "public officials" who are greedy for money and use their power for personal gain. Some of them collude with lawless individuals among the business owners, disrupting the economic order and harming the interests of the state and consumers. Some use scarce resources to sell to individual business owners at high prices; some issue fake invoices to provide tax evasion receipts for individual business owners; some help individual business owners hang fake collective enterprise signs to cheat and obtain tax exemptions. Even some public officials in the industrial and commercial, and tax departments cannot resist the temptation of money. Some, after accepting large bribes, open the door for individual business owners' illegal operations and tax evasion, acting as their protective umbrella to help them evade inspections. These people violate the law while enforcing it, corrupt social morals, and damage the image of the Party and government in the hearts of the people. Although their numbers are small, their impact is very bad.

Currently, the state is strengthening supervision and management of individual business owners, focusing on investigating illegal business activities and rectifying the tax order among individual business owners. It is completely justified to severely punish those who violate laws and discipline among individual business owners, and to fine those who have become wealthy by exploiting the state and squeezing the people. However, in the process of cleaning up and rectifying, those "public officials" who are involved should not be let off the hook. These people are actually the termites of the socialist economy. If the termites are not eliminated, the harm will be even greater. Those who are responsible for management and supervision but violate the law should be dealt with seriously and cannot be tolerated.

### 别放过那些“公家人”

    别放过那些“公家人”
    钊拓
    江苏省武进县年仅25岁的个体户袁解胜，偷漏国家税款38万元，成了暴发户。其违法行为何以能得逞？一个重要原因，是有些国营、集体单位掌有财、物之权的所谓“公家人”得了他的好处，为他提供了数百万坯布倒卖，还为他提供假凭证逃税。据查，仅7个供货单位的供销员，就接受袁的贿赂7万余元。
    用金钱腐蚀、拉拢“公家人”，通关节，铺路子，以便挖国家墙脚，捞更多油水，这并非袁解胜的创造，也不是个别的现象。不少个体工商户能在较短时间内靠非法经营、偷税漏税大发横财，往往使的都是这一招。
    令人痛心的是，确有一些“公家人”，贪图钱财，以权谋私。有些人与个体户中的不法之徒沆瀣一气，扰乱经济秩序，损害国家和消费者利益。有的凭紧俏物资供个体户高价倒卖；有的代开假发票，为个体户逃税提供凭证；有的为个体户挂假集体企业招牌，骗取减免税优惠。甚至有的工商、税务等部门的公职人员，在金钱面前也经受不住考验。有的在接受重金贿赂后，为个体户的违法经营、偷税漏税大开方便之门，为他们逃避检查充当保护伞。这些人执法犯法，败坏社会风气，损害了党和政府在群众心目中的形象。尽管人数不多，但影响极坏。
    现在，国家为加强对个体工商户的监督管理，正集中力量清查个体户中的违法经营行为，整顿个体税收秩序。对个体户中的违法乱纪者，严加惩处，完全应该。对那些靠吃国家、榨老百姓而暴富者，就是要罚他个倾家荡产。但在清理、整顿中，对与之有牵连的那些“公家人”，更不能放过。这些人实际上是社会主义经济这棵大树上的蛀虫，蛀虫不除，危害更大。对那些担负管理监督的职责而执法犯法的人，尤应严肃处理，不可姑息。
