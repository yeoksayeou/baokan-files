Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, August 17th.

Yugoslavia will reform its currency, issuing new currency to replace the current one.

This was stated by Federal Government Deputy Prime Minister Mitrović in an interview with the South Slavic *Politika* newspaper.

Mitrović said that the Federal Government originally planned to implement currency reform next year, but now it has to be accelerated. However, he did not disclose the specific date for implementing the currency reform.

In recent years, Yugoslavia's inflation has become increasingly severe, with the current inflation rate reaching 800%, and there is a danger of it rising to four digits. Due to the sharp increase in prices, the dinar has depreciated significantly, with the exchange rate of the dollar to the dinar being 1:125.7 at the end of 1983, and now 1 dollar can be exchanged for more than 25,000 dinars.

The significant depreciation of the Yugoslav currency has caused great difficulties for residents, shops, and banks. To meet the needs of circulation, the National Bank of Yugoslavia has had to issue high-denomination banknotes. After issuing 100,000 dinar banknotes on June 1st this year, it issued 2,000,000 dinar banknotes on August 11th. Under these circumstances, currency reform is imperative.

    南斯拉夫将改革货币
    新华社贝尔格莱德8月17日电　（记者徐坤明）南斯拉夫将改革货币，即发行新的货币以取代现行货币。
    这是南联邦政府副总理米特罗维奇在向南《政治报》发表谈话时表示的。
    米特罗维奇说，联邦政府原计划明年实行货币改革，但现在不得不加速进行。但他没有透露实行货币改革的具体日期。
    近些年来，南斯拉夫通货膨胀日益严重，目前通货膨胀率已高达800％，而且有向4位数发展的危险。由于物价猛涨，第纳尔大幅度贬值，美元与第纳尔的汇率1983年底为1比125.7，而现在1美元已能兑换25000多第纳尔。
    南货币大幅度贬值给居民、商店和银行造成了很大困难。为了满足流通领域的需要，南斯拉夫人民银行不得不发行大面额钞票，继今年6月1日发行面额为10万第纳尔的钞票后，8月11日又发行了面额为200万第纳尔的钞票。在这种形势下，货币改革势在必行。
