	The First Hospital, Second Hospital, Third Hospital, Sixth Hospital, and the Obstetrics and Gynecology Planning and Birth Control Room of the Light Industry Hospital all arbitrarily raised the fees for birth control surgeries. According to regulations, the fee for inserting an IUD should be 2.5 yuan per case, and the fee for removing an IUD should be 2 yuan. However, they all charged 15 yuan. The First Hospital and the Third Hospital did not follow the regulation of charging 0.60 yuan for the first day of infant care and 0.30 yuan for subsequent days, instead charging 0.60 yuan uniformly.
