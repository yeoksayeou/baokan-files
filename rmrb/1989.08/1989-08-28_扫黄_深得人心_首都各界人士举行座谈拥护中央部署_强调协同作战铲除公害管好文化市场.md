	The campaign against pornography wins popular support. Representatives from various sectors in the capital held a symposium today to express their firm support for the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They emphasized the need for coordinated efforts to eradicate public nuisances and manage the cultural market.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th - Representatives from various sectors in the capital held a symposium today to discuss the rectification and cleaning up of the book, newspaper, and audio-visual markets. They expressed their firm support for the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, stressing the need for coordinated efforts to thoroughly eliminate various "spiritual poisons" and "cultural garbage."

	Yu Qinghe, Secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said, "The campaign against pornography is beneficial to the country and the people." Facing the rampant spread of obscene and pornographic publications, many workers' families are worried. This social nuisance should have been eradicated long ago. He introduced some specific measures recently formulated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and emphasized that policies must be handled with great caution. Normal life and cultural interests of workers should not be interfered with. The bad should be eliminated, and the good should be developed. At the same time, efforts should be made to expand the cultural life of workers.

	Ma Zhanggen, Deputy Director of the Equipment Department of the State Education Commission, introduced some shocking facts in his speech. He said that in recent years, some negative trends have emerged among university students. Although this is related to the weakening of political and ideological work, the influence of reactionary and pornographic publications cannot be underestimated. Middle school teachers compare these publications to "a knife that kills without blood." In one middle school class, which was originally an advanced collective in the district, the class atmosphere quickly deteriorated after pornographic publications circulated secretly. Within a year, 4 students were held back, and 1 committed a crime.

	Li Yuanchao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League of China, believes that the campaign against pornography creates a favorable environment for the growth of young people. According to his investigation, pornographic publications and videos directly induce young people to commit crimes. Although activities such as "inspection and seizure" and "strike hard" have been carried out in recent years, the results have not been significant. He said that the improvement of the book, newspaper, and audio-visual markets cannot rely solely on administrative measures but also requires comprehensive governance through economic, legal, and other means to fundamentally solve the problem.

	Guan Tao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, said that the campaign against pornography is deeply supported by the people, especially by mothers and women. The All-China Women's Federation calls on all women to actively participate in this struggle.

	Fei Kaijun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Individual Industrial and Commercial Households, proposed that the key to rectification and cleaning up is to block the sources of pollution. Wang Ziyou, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, summarized the experiences and lessons of the campaign against pornography over the past few years. He said that it is crucial not to repeat the past "one-time effort" but to prepare for a long-term battle. Currently, relevant regulations and statutes need to be promulgated as soon as possible.

	Liu Zhongde, Vice Secretary-General of the State Council, said in his speech that eradicating "cultural garbage" requires the joint efforts of the whole society. He hoped that all sectors of society and every family would care about and support the rectification and cleaning up work, consciously resist various "spiritual poisons," and hoped that all people's organizations and relevant departments would closely cooperate and work together to manage the cultural market well. Today's symposium was organized by the State Press and Publication Administration.

    “扫黄”深得人心
    首都各界人士举行座谈拥护中央部署
    强调协同作战铲除公害管好文化市场
    据新华社北京8月28日电　首都各界人士今天聚会座谈整顿清理书报刊及音像市场时表示：坚决拥护党中央、国务院的部署，一定要协同作战，彻底清除各种“精神毒品”和“文化垃圾”。
    全国总工会书记处书记于庆和说，“扫黄”是利国、利民之举。面对淫秽色情出版物泛滥成灾的状况，许多职工家庭忧心忡忡。这一社会公害早就该铲除了。他介绍了总工会新近制订的一些具体措施后强调，必须十分审慎地把握政策，不能干涉职工正常的生活和文化爱好，扫除坏的，是要发展好的，与此同时，要设法拓宽职工文化生活领域。
    国家教委条件装配司副司长马樟根在发言中介绍一些触目惊心的事实。他说，近几年，大学生中出现了一些不良倾向。固然，这同政治思想工作的被削弱有关，但反动、黄色书刊的影响也不能低估。中学教师们将这类书刊比作“杀人不见血的刀”。一个初中班原是区里的先进集体，黄色书刊在班上悄悄流传后，班风迅速变坏，一年内竟有4人留级，1人犯罪。
    团中央书记处书记李源潮认为，“扫黄”为优化青少年成长环境创造了有利条件。根据他的调查，黄色书刊及录像直接诱导青少年犯罪。尽管这几年开展过“查禁”、“严打”等活动，但收效不大。他说，书报刊及音像市场的改观不能只靠行政手段，还要靠经济、法律等手段综合治理，以求从根本上解决问题。
    全国妇联书记处书记关涛称“扫黄”深得人心，尤其是深得母亲、妇女之心。全国妇联号召广大妇女自觉投身这场斗争。
    全国个体劳动者协会副会长费开龙提出，清理整顿的关键是堵塞污染源。中国出版工作者协会主席王子野总结这几年“扫黄”的经验教训时说，千万不能像以往那样“一阵风”，要有长期战斗的准备，眼下亟需有关法规、条例尽快出台。
    国务院副秘书长刘忠德在发言中说，铲除“文化垃圾”要靠全社会的共同努力，希望社会各界和每个家庭都来关心支持清理整顿工作，自觉抵制各种“精神毒品”，希望各人民团体及有关部门紧密配合，协同作战，将文化市场管理好。今天的座谈会由新闻出版署主办。
