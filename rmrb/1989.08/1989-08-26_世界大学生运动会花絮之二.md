The South Korean athletes who got lost

One day, a South Korean athlete got lost during a running training session. This caused great concern for the team's escorts, as the athletes did not speak any foreign language and could not even ask for directions. In a moment of inspiration, two escorts from the team wrote numerous "Follow me" signs in Korean. The police officers wore these signs and rode motorcycles around the area. The lost South Korean athletes saw the signs and were delighted, following the police convoy back to their accommodation.

The unique racewalking of the Ghanaian student Lawrence Tetteh

Lawrence Tetteh, a Ghanaian student who initially intended to participate in swimming but later changed to the 20-kilometer racewalk, became the center of attention as soon as the competition began. Walking and racewalking are two different things, and his unique posture resembled a limping duck, wobbling and swaying, which caused the entire stadium of over ten thousand spectators to burst into laughter. However, he continued to walk, and the entire audience enthusiastically encouraged him with applause. But ultimately, he was too slow, and the referee advised him to give up the race. He reluctantly accepted the suggestion. Nevertheless, people will remember him—this innocent and enthusiastic Ghanaian student, Lawrence Tetteh.

    世界大学生运动会花絮之二
    跑丢了的南朝鲜运动员
    某日，南朝鲜运动员在跑步训练中“丢”了。这可急坏了该队的陪同，因为这些运动员一句外语不会，连问路也没有办法。急中生智，该队的两位陪同用朝鲜文写了许多个“跟着我走”的布条，警察们佩带上这些布条骑着摩托车在那一带路上兜来兜去。迷了路的南朝鲜运动员一看这些布条乐了，一个个跟着警察车队回到驻地。
    加纳大学生特特的竞走
    原想报名参加游泳，后改报二十公里竞走的加纳大学生特特，昨天在比赛一开始就成了全场的新闻人物。到底走路和竞走是两码事，他那奇特的姿势像一只跛脚鸭，摇摇晃晃，引得全场上万人哄堂大笑。但他仍然要走下去，全场观众都以掌声热情地鼓励他。但究竟是太慢了，裁判员劝他放弃比赛算了，后来他总算勉强接受了这一建议。然而，人们都将记住他——这个天真、热情的加纳大学生劳伦斯·特特。　本报记者　江建国
