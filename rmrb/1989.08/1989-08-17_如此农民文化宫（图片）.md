Gansu Province's Linxia County built a grand "Taozhou Farmers' Cultural Palace" last October (left). However, inside, there are only superstition activities such as praying to gods and burning incense, with no other cultural activities.

The third floor of the cultural palace is filled with smoke from incense, and the Buddhist lamps are always lit. People seeking blessings from the gods come in an endless stream (right).

    如此农民文化宫
    甘肃省临潭县去年10月建了一座富丽堂皇的“洮州农民文化宫”（左）。可是，里面除了求神拜佛的迷信活动，没有任何其他文化活动。
