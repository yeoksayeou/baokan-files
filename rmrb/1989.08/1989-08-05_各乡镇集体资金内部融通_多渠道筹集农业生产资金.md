Intra-Township Collective Funds Circulation and Multi-Channel Fundraising for Agricultural Production

According to the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 5th, (reporter Lù Yǒngjiàn) the internal circulation of cooperative economic funds, as a new method of managing and utilizing collective funds in the reform era, is rapidly developing from point to area across China. The Agricultural Department's Management Bureau reported that, according to incomplete statistics, 1/4 of the townships in 23 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have carried out internal financing within the rural cooperative economy, accumulating a total of 5.66 billion yuan in funds available for circulation.

After more than 30 years of cooperative labor, China's rural collectives have accumulated 82 billion yuan in funds, including 25 billion yuan in liquid assets. Additionally, there are more than 10 billion yuan in collective retained earnings each year. These funds are an important financial resource for the development of the rural economy, especially agricultural production. After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, the management and use of these collective funds became somewhat chaotic, leading to a decline in collective accumulation and the long-term withholding of a large amount of collective funds.

Since 1983, provinces such as Jiangsu and Hebei have addressed this situation by initiating internal financing within the cooperative economy on the basis of maintaining the ownership of funds and mutual benefit. The primary source of funds is collective funds, the scope of circulation is within the township and village cooperative organizations, and the purpose is to serve and support the development of production for households, cooperatives, and enterprises within the township. Most of the income from financing is returned to the fund owners, increasing collective accumulation and farmers' income. According to incomplete statistics, more than 15,000 townships in China have carried out this work.

Practice has proven that this not only effectively prevents the misuse and squandering of collective funds, but also initially reverses the downward trend of collective accumulation funds, and finds a new way to raise funds for agricultural production through multiple channels, establishing a new type of agricultural investment mechanism with rural self-funding as the mainstay. In 1988, the internal financing of Hebei, Jilin, Henan, and Sichuan provinces increased agricultural investment by more than 500 million yuan.

Internal financing also supplements the shortage of bank and credit union loan funds, supporting commodity production.

    各乡镇集体资金内部融通  多渠道筹集农业生产资金
    据新华社北京8月5日电  （记者鹿永建）合作经济内部资金融通，作为改革时代集体资金新的管理使用方式，在我国正由点及面迅速发展。农业部经管总站称，据不完全统计，全国23个省、市、自治区已有1／4乡镇开展了农村合作经济内部融资，已聚集可融通资金56.6亿元。
    经过30多年合作劳动，我国农村集体已积累资金820多亿元，其中流动资金250多亿元。每年还有100多亿元集体提留款。这是农村经济特别是农业生产发展的重要资金力量。农村实行家庭承包责任制后，这笔集体资金的管理使用一度比较混乱，集体积累下降，大量集体资金被长期拖欠。
    1983年来，江苏、河北等地针对这一情况，在坚持资金所有权不变、自愿互利基础上，先后开展了合作经济内部融资工作：以集体资金为主要资金来源，以乡、村合作组织内部为融通范围，以服务为宗旨，支持本乡的农户、联合体、企业发展生产，大部分融资收入返还给资金所有者，以增加集体积累和农民收入。据不完全统计，我国开展这项工作的乡镇已在15000个以上。
    实践证明，这不仅有效制止了集体资金被贪占胡花，初步扭转了集体积累资金下降趋势，而且为多渠道筹集农业生产资金，建立以农村自身资金投入为主的新型农业投资机制找到一条新途径。1988年，河北、吉林、河南、四川四省内部融资增加农业投入5亿多元。
    内部融资还弥补了银行、信用社信贷资金的不足，支持了商品生产。
