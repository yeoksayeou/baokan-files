On the morning of August 21, the Chinese and Japanese women's teams engaged in a fierce battle at the Shijingshan Sports Gymnasium. After 48 minutes of intense play, the score was still tied. The points for both teams fluctuated back and forth.

There were only 12 minutes left until the end of the game. Could the Chinese team secure a victory in their first match of the second Asian Women's Handball Championship? The audience was on the edge of their seats, worried for the girls.

The Chinese team's skills were on par with the Japanese team. In the 1986 World Championship, the two teams drew. In the 1987 first Asian Championship, China narrowly defeated Japan by 3 points, securing a spot in the Seoul Olympics. Two years later, both teams had undergone significant changes, with many new faces, but their skills remained closely matched. The Japanese team maintained their characteristic fast-paced attack and defense. After veterans like He Jianping and Sun Xiulan left the Chinese team, their original strength of quick counterattacks on the wings was lost, so they focused more on set-piece attacks.

In the first half, the Chinese team was disrupted by the Japanese team's fast pace, had fewer attacking patterns, and had more defensive gaps, appearing somewhat passive, trailing 10-11.

During the halftime break, Coach Zhang Yulin reminded the Chinese team members to stick to their own rhythm and tactics, and not to be led by the opponent.

In the second half, the Chinese team played calmly and deliberately, focusing on success rates. Their defense was aggressive, causing the Japanese team to make more mistakes and struggle to keep up their pace. The more desperate the Japanese team became, the more stable the Chinese team played. The situation gradually turned in favor of the home team.

"Great shot!" Amidst the cheers, it was seen that number 17 Shi Wei of the Chinese team scored a powerful left-handed shot, sending the ball straight into the net. With 11 minutes and 30 seconds left in the game, the Chinese team first widened the score gap to 3 points. In this match, the young player Shi Wei from Beijing played despite an injury and scored 14 points in total.

The Chinese team's morale soared. In the final 10 minutes, sometimes it was number 18 Lu Guanghong's clever turnaround shot that went into the net; sometimes it was the tall forward number 2 Zhang Hong's tank-like powerful shot. The score widened to 21-18, then 23-19. The Chinese girls maintained their advantage until the final whistle, ultimately winning the first match with a score of 25-21.

    以慢制快
    ——记中国女子手球队力克日本队
    21日上午，中日女将在石景山体育馆里的一场激战打了48分钟，战局仍呈僵持状态。双方比分交替上升。
    还差12分钟终场时间就到了。中国队在第二届亚洲女子手球锦标赛的首战能否告捷？观众真为姑娘们捏一把汗。
    中国队同日本队水平相近。1986年世界锦标赛上，两队战平；1987年首届亚洲锦标赛，中国仅以3分之差淘汰日本队，夺得参加汉城奥运会的资格。时隔两年，双方阵容大变，多为新面孔，水平却依然很接近。日本队保持了以往攻守速度快的特点。而中国队自从何剑萍、孙秀兰等老将离队后，原来的边路快速反击特长“失传”了，只好在阵地进攻上多下功夫。
    上半时，中国队被日本队的快节奏打乱，进攻套路少，防守漏洞多，显得有些被动，以10∶11落后。
  中场休息时，张玉林教练叮嘱中国队队员要按自己的节奏和战术打，别让对方牵着鼻子走。
    下半时，中国队打得不慌不忙，讲求成功率，防守时逼抢凶，使日本队失误增加，快不起来。日本队越急，中国队越稳。局势一点一点朝着有利于东道主的方向发展。
    “好球！”伴着喝彩声只见中国队17号石伟一记左手劲射，球直钻网底。中国队在离比赛结束还有11分多钟时，第一次将比分差距拉大为3分。这场比赛，来自北京的小将石伟是带伤上阵，她全场连射带罚独得14分之多。
    中国队士气大涨。最后10分钟，一会儿是18号陆广红巧妙的转身倒地卧射破网；一会儿是高前锋2号张弘坦克般的强突打门。21∶18，23∶19，比分差距一点点拉大，中国姑娘将优势保持至终场，最后以25∶21夺得首场比赛胜利。
