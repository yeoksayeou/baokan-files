    Protecting the Interests of the People
    Look into the actions of those who engage in corruption, and you will find that not a single act is free from harming public interests for private gain, harming others for personal benefit, or damaging the interests of the people! One of the great significances of combating corruption lies in the fact that it is a struggle to uphold the fundamental interests of the people.
    The people are the masters of the country, and their interests are the highest interests of the state. The series of laws, policies, and measures formulated by our Party and state, and the steps taken, all start from the consideration of how to better serve the interests of the people. This includes considering both the long-term and immediate interests of the people; it involves protecting the legitimate economic, political, and civil rights that the people enjoy according to the law and policies, as well as preventing anyone from seeking private gains and privileges beyond the scope of the law and policies. The leading cadres and workers of the Party and the state are, through their official duties, engaged in the sacred cause of serving the interests of the people.
    Currently, corrupt behavior is strongly manifested in two aspects: the objects of harm and official conduct. In terms of the objects of harm, it is mostly aimed at harming the property of the state and the collective. Those who engage in corruption use various despicable means, such as illegal possession, embezzlement, misappropriation, extortion, and illegal requisition, purchase, and levies. In terms of official conduct, they are extremely selfish and indulge in privileges. They demand spacious and beautiful housing, exquisite and inexpensive food, and comfortable and luxurious cars. In dealing with issues such as the employment, education, promotion, and urbanization of their children and relatives, they act lawlessly and disorderly. This will directly harm the fundamental interests of the people. If such corrupt practices are not severely punished, how can we mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people and enhance their sense of responsibility as masters?
    Regarding strengthening the construction of clean government and combating corruption, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have recently made decisions that are deeply in line with the people's wishes. The leading comrades of various regions and units should examine: what corrupt practices that harm the interests of the people exist in your areas, and how should they be corrected and prevented. Every Party member and cadre must use the immortal words to inspire themselves, such as: “Suffer hardships first and enjoy later,” “Seek no personal gain, but dedicate oneself to the people,” “Do not take a single needle or thread from the people,” “Resist corruption and never yield”…

### 保护群众利益

    保护群众利益
    查一查那些搞腐败的人做的事，哪一件不是损公肥私、损人利己、损害群众利益的！惩治腐败的伟大意义之一，就在于这是一场维护人民群众根本利益的斗争。
    人民群众是国家的主人，他们的利益就是国家的最高利益。我们党和国家所制定的一系列法律、方针、政策，所采取的一系列措施，出发点总是考虑到如何更好地为人民群众谋利益。这中间，既考虑到了人民群众的长远利益，又考虑到了人民群众的眼前利益；既考虑到了怎样保护人民群众依照法律、政策所享有的正当的经济权利、政治权利和民事权利，又考虑到了如何限制任何人谋求法律、政策规定范围之外的任何私利和特权。党和国家的领导干部和工作人员，正是以自己的职务行为，进行着为人民群众谋利益的神圣事业。
    当前，腐败行为强烈地表现在侵害对象和职务行为两个方面。在侵害对象上，多是以侵害国家和集体的财产为目的。搞腐败的人采取种种卑鄙手段，如无偿占有，克扣私分，截留挪用，敲诈勒索，违反规定的征用、征购、摊派等。在职务行为上，极端重己，大搞特权。他们住房要宽大漂亮的，食用要物美价廉的，坐车要舒适豪华的。在对待子女亲友的就业、升学、提干、农转非等问题上，违法乱纪。这势必直接侵害到人民群众的根本利益。如果对这种腐败现象不严加惩治，怎样去调动广大人民群众的积极性、增强他们的主人翁责任感？
    关于加强廉政建设、惩治腐败，最近，党中央、国务院做出了深得民心的决定。各地区、各单位的领导同志应查一查：你们那里存在着哪些侵害群众利益的腐败行为，应该怎样去纠正、预防。每一个党员、干部，十分有必要用那不朽的警句激励自己，这就是：“吃苦在前，享受在后”，“毫不利己，专门利人”，“不拿群众一针一线”，“拒腐蚀，永不沾”……
