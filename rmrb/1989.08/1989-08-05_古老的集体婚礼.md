Every year from January to July is a pleasant season for the Dutch. Located in northwestern Europe, the Netherlands has a maritime climate that is warm and humid, without severe winters or scorching summers. The land is lush and green year-round, with dense forests. It is flat and vast; looking north towards the North Sea, the horizon blurs the line between water and sky. It is on this land that the Dutch ancestors have battled the sea for centuries. The fishermen in this area still maintain ancient traditions and customs. Every festival season, the fishermen of Friesland in the northwestern Netherlands dress in traditional attire: elderly women wear black skirts, white lace caps, and white shawls; men dress as knights, in black suits, riding breeches, top hats, and pipes, all passed down from their ancestors. As the harvest season nears its end in July, the people of Friesland organize group wedding ceremonies in some towns and parishes to commemorate the ancient traditions of the region, celebrating the harvest and reminiscing about the past.

The group wedding ceremony almost takes up half a day. The brides' gowns are rich in national characteristics, adorned with embroidery, deep-colored tops, and long, flowing skirts with gold and silver lace trimmings, making them look elegant and graceful. The grooms dress similarly to Cossacks, wearing white silk shirts, embroidered vests, black suits, bow ties, and black leather shoes. The bride and groom sit together in a shiny, antique carriage, parading through the streets and alleys, receiving blessings from the people.

The ceremony begins with violins and accordions playing classical music as the carriage circles the venue. The groom then presents the bride with a branch adorned with fresh flowers to drive the carriage, and the bride reciprocates by giving the groom a pipe. At this moment, the newlyweds throw candies to the guests. The in-laws exchange homemade wine, and long tables made of wooden planks on the lawn are filled with wine mixed with grapes and dried fruits, bread, cheese, sausages, and the aroma wafts through the air. The newlyweds cut the bread into pieces and distribute them to friends and guests, also serving the already-brewed coffee. At this time, the violin music starts again, and people eat and dance.

Next is the special event of the wedding, where the bride and groom showcase their skills and push the ceremony to its climax—the "ring snatching" competition. Six wooden poles are erected in the town's main street, each about 100 meters apart, with a horizontal "hand" on each pole, and each "finger" has a large "ring" on it. The bride and groom sit side by side in the carriage, driving past, with the bride snatching the "rings." They run back and forth four times, and the couple who snatches the most "rings" is the winner of the year. For this, the groom must drive the carriage as close to the roadside poles as possible, making it easier for the bride to snatch the "rings." The standing spectators will spontaneously cheer for the couples, with laughter rising and falling in waves.

Finally, the town elders award the winners with an ancient wooden clock from Friesland, which the victors can keep at home for a year before passing it on to the next year's "ring snatching" winners.

As the sun sets, the evening glow reddens the faces of the couples, marking a moment they will never forget.

    古老的集体婚礼
    梦湖
    每年1到7月，对荷兰人来说是令人惬意的季节。
    地处西北欧的荷兰，属海洋性气候，温暖湿润，没有严冬和酷暑。一年四季大地青翠碧绿，森林葱葱郁郁。这里一马平川，无边无垠；举目望北海，远处水天不分。就在这块大地上荷兰人的祖先曾与大海搏斗了整整几个世纪。当地的渔民，至今仍然保持着古老的传统和习俗。荷兰西北部弗里斯兰省的渔民每逢佳节，老年妇女穿起黑色蓬裙，头戴花边小白帽，身披白色披肩；男士们打扮成骑士，黑西服、马裤、头戴礼帽，衔烟斗，这些都是祖先留下来的传统。7月收获季节接近尾声，弗里斯兰人为重温古时传统文化，在一些城镇、教区，为青年男女主办19世纪前在这一带盛行的集体婚礼，以庆贺丰收，发思古之幽情。
    集体婚礼几乎要化大半天的时间。新娘礼服颇具民族特色，都是刺绣的，深色上衣和拖地长蓬裙都镶有金线和银线的花边，打扮得十分秀丽得体。新郎近似哥萨克人的装束，白绸衬衣，绣花马甲，黑礼服，蝴蝶结，黑皮鞋。新郎与新娘双双坐在油漆得金光闪闪的古老马车上，穿过大街小巷，接受人们的祝贺。
    婚礼开始，小提琴、手风琴奏起古典乐曲，马车绕场一周。这时新郎赠给新娘一条扎着鲜花的树枝，用来赶马车，新娘回赠新郎一支烟斗。此时此刻，一对对新人向来宾抛撒糖果。亲家们互赠自制美酒，草坪上用木板搭的长桌上已摆满了掺有葡萄干果的美酒、面包、奶酪、香肠，香气扑鼻而来。新人们将面包切成一块块，分送给亲友来宾，把已煮好的咖啡也递给各位。此时，小提琴声再次扬起，人们边吃边舞。
    紧接着是婚礼的特别节目，此时新郎新娘合作大显身手，将婚礼推向高潮——新郎新娘“抢戒子”比赛。小镇大街上立起6根木椿，每个木椿相距100米左右，木椿上横着一只“手”，五指分开，每个“指头”上套有一只大“戒子”。新郎新娘平坐在马车上赶车而过，由新娘“抢戒子”，来回跑4次，“戒子”抢得越多的新人，就是本年度的获胜者。为此新郎必须把马车尽可能赶近路边木椿，便于新娘抢下“戒子”。这时站着的观众都会不约而同地为一对对新人加油，笑声一阵高过一阵，此起彼落……
    最后由小镇长者为获胜者发奖，把一座弗里斯兰古老木钟交给他们，胜利者可把木钟在家摆一年，待来年移交给下一年度的“抢戒子”胜利者。
    夕阳西下，晚霞映红了一对对新人的脸，他们度过了这一终生难忘的时刻……
