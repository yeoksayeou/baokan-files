Recently, the Anhui Province trade delegation to Japan practiced thrift and savings during their stay, meticulously planning and calculating, and in 20 days of activities, saved the country $220,000 in expenses, all of which were turned over to the state.

The state allocated $420,000 for various expenses for this trade delegation during their stay in Japan. Since this was the province's first large-scale economic and trade activity held independently in Japan, to expand its influence, they planned to hold a reception with 200 participants on the opening day of the trade talks. The original host wanted to take advantage of this to make a profit, charging 10,000 yen per person. Later, the delegation members compared prices at several places and chose a restaurant run by Chinese people, charging 4,000 yen per person, saving 60% of the costs. During their daily outings, they walked to nearby places and took the subway or bus to far places. They chose cheaper meals, saving 16.8 million yen in living expenses alone, which they voluntarily turned over to the state.

Due to their sincere attitude, the trade talks were successful, with actual transactions amounting to $20 million, exceeding the original plan by 66.7%. They also signed five projects with Japanese businesses, including "three-in-one compensation" and joint ventures.

    安徽赴日洽谈团节俭办事
    出国20天为国家节省开支22万美元
    本报讯　最近，安徽省赴日贸易洽谈团在日本期间勤俭节约、精打细算，全团42人在20天的活动中为国家节省开支22万美元，全部上交了国家。
    国家给这个贸易洽谈团在日期间的各种费用核定为42万美元。由于这是该省首次单独在日本举办规模较大的一次经贸活动，为扩大影响，他们准备在洽谈会开幕那天举行一个由200人参加的酒会。原来承办的老板想借此敲一笔，要价每人是1万日元，后来洽谈团的同志经过多家比较，选定了一家由中国人办的餐馆，每人4000日元，节约费用60％。他们平时外出工作，近的地方步行，远的挤地铁或公共汽车。饭菜挑便宜的吃，仅生活费一项每人就省下168万日元，并把这笔钱主动上交给国家。
    由于他们真诚待人，使洽谈会获得成功，实际成交2000万美元，比原计划超66.7％。同时还和日商签订了“三来一补”、合资经营等项目5个。　　　（龚舒斌）
