	The Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Provincial Government have decided to use all the seized funds from the "yellow" crackdown to support the publication of excellent books and to fund the operational expenses of the crackdown.

	This decision was announced by Provincial Committee Deputy Secretary Mou Lingsheng at a provincial teleconference on the "yellow" crackdown yesterday evening.

	In recent times, some publishing units in Shaanxi Province have faced severe shortages in funds for publishing excellent books, while "yellow" and "black" books have flooded the cultural market.

	To change this situation, the Provincial Committee and Provincial Government have decided, in addition to further rectifying the content of publications and increasing funds for publishing excellent books, to allocate 70% of the seized funds from handling cases of violations of publishing regulations to supplement the publication funds for excellent works that promote revolutionary ideals, socialist ethical and moral thinking, and the excellent cultural heritage of the nation. The remaining 30% of the seized funds will be used for the operational expenses of the "yellow" crackdown.

    陕西将“扫黄”罚没款用于扶持优秀图书出版
    本报西安8月27日电　记者孟西安报道：陕西省委、省政府决定将“扫黄”的罚没收款项，全部用于扶植优秀图书出版和“扫黄”办案经费。
    这项决定，是省委副书记牟玲生昨晚在全省“扫黄”电话会议上宣布的。
    一个时期以来，陕西省一些出版单位出版优秀书籍的经费严重不足，文化市场上“黄书”、“黑书”泛滥。
    为了改变这种状况，省委、省政府除了采取进一步整顿出版内容、增加优秀图书出版经费外，决定将处理违反出版规定的各类案件的罚没收款的70％，用于补充宣传革命理想和社会主义思想道德、弘扬民族优秀文化遗产的优秀读物和学术著作出版基金，将罚没收款的30％用于“扫黄”办案经费。
