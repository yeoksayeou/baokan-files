Qiao Shi Meets with American Friend Sol Auerbach

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 5th - Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Qiao Shi met and had dinner with American friend Sol Auerbach and his wife Pat this evening at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, expressing warm congratulations on Auerbach's 80th birthday.

Qiao Shi thanked Comrade Auerbach for his extensive work in support of the Chinese people's liberation cause, socialist construction, and the friendship between the peoples of China and the United States.

Auerbach is an old friend of the Chinese people. As early as the 1930s, he began to pay attention to the fate of the Chinese people. Since the 1940s, he has sympathized with and supported the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and for liberation under the leadership of our Party. After the founding of New China, he visited China multiple times, enthusiastically and objectively introducing New China, and doing a great deal of work to promote the understanding of New China abroad. In the early 1960s, when China encountered temporary difficulties, he, with deep affection for the Chinese people and unwavering confidence in the socialist cause, decided to settle in China and directly participate in and assist with China's socialist construction. He has been with the Chinese people through thick and thin for decades, sharing their joys and sorrows. With his profound knowledge of international economics and politics, he has made many valuable suggestions for China's economic construction and foreign work, making positive contributions to China's socialist construction. He has also participated in the translation and editing of the works of China's older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, as well as important documents of the Communist Party of China and the government, enhancing the world's understanding of China's revolutionary and construction undertakings.
