In January 1930, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his immortal work "Star Sparks Can Become a Prairie Fire," pointed out: "The line of Juzhu Mao Zedong, Fang Zhimin, and others, which involves having a base area, building a government according to a plan, carrying out a thorough land revolution, and expanding the people's armed forces, is a policy that undoubtedly is correct. This policy involves a series of methods starting from the village Red Guards, district Red Guard battalions, county Red Guard regiments, local Red Army, and finally the regular Red Army. The development of political power is a wave-like expansion forward, etc." Later, he praised, "The comrades in Gan Dongbei also have excellent creations; they are also model workers." This is Comrade Mao Zedong's full affirmation and high praise for the Gan Dongbei base area.

The Gan Dongbei Revolutionary Base Area was an important base area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, established in 1927. It underwent a development process from Yi-Heng (Yishan and Hengfeng), to Xinjiang, to Gan Dongbei, and finally to Min-Zhe-Gan (Anhui). Initially, it referred to the area of about 60 to 70 square kilometers where revolutionary governments were established in Yishan, Hengfeng, and other places, known as the Yi-Heng base area or the revolutionary base area centered on Mopanshan. Later, its scope expanded beyond these places, gradually developing and expanding to include 21 counties in Gan Dongbei, 13 counties in northern Fujian, 21 counties in western (southern) Zhejiang, and 17 counties in southern Anhui, totaling 72 counties. Of course, many of these places were guerrilla areas.

Why did Comrade Mao Zedong refer to the Gan Dongbei Revolutionary Base Area as "Fang Zhimin-style"? This is not just because this base area was led and founded by comrades such as Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, and Huang Dao, but because there are deeper reasons. In summary, I think it is because this base area has characteristics of innovation, pioneering, self-reliance, and flexibility. Its innovation lies in the fact that the Gan Dongbei Party combined the universal truths of Marxism with the actual conditions of Gan Dongbei, gradually creating a unique set of methods for building the Party, the army, and the government in revolutionary practice, thus creating the Gan Dongbei base area that no one had ever created before. Its pioneering spirit lies in the great enthusiasm and indomitable will shown by the Gan Dongbei Party and the masses in the unprecedented task of armed seizure of power and the establishment of a red base area. Its self-reliance lies in the fact that the Gan Dongbei base area, in the economic, political, cultural, and natural environment at that time, had no ready-made models to imitate and no external support to rely on, but struggled hard and strove for self-reliance. Its flexibility lies in the fact that the Gan Dongbei Party was good at starting from local realities and creating a set of flexible and effective policies and principles.

Here, I would like to recall and reflect on some important historical facts about the Gan Dongbei base area, and, with all due modesty, specifically discuss my views on the "Fang Zhimin-style" base area, as a tribute to Fang Zhimin on his 90th birthday.

The establishment of the Gan Dongbei base area, like the Jinggangshan and other base areas, should be said to be the product of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary practice of our country. They are successful attempts at surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power by force. However, its establishment also has characteristics different from other base areas at that time, which can be explained from the following three points:

First, the Party organization was established before the base area; initially, it was a small number of intellectual Party members, and later, most were peasant Party members. As early as 1922, when Fang Zhimin was in Shanghai, he was introduced by Zhao Xingnong to join the Communist Youth League of China, and in March 1924, he became a member of the Communist Party of China, becoming one of the earliest Party members in the Gan Dongbei region. Later, Fang Zhimin returned to his hometown, Yishan County, Qicao Town, and developed some progressive youth to join the Party, forming a Party cell. By the end of the year, he expanded the Party cell into a temporary Party branch, with Fang Zhimin as the secretary.

After the March 18th Incident in Beijing in 1926, Shao Shiping, who was studying at Beijing Normal University, was wanted by the reactionary government for actively participating in and leading the student revolutionary movement. It was dangerous for him to stay in Beijing, so he returned to Jiangxi in secret to engage in peasant movements. Later, he came to Yishan, where he held a secret meeting in the county seat and formally organized the first Party branch in Yishan County. This was in the autumn of 1926.

Before and after the establishment of the Yishan Party branch, Huang Dao, who had joined the Party while studying at Beijing Normal University, followed the Party's instructions to absorb a group of advanced elements into the Party from the original "Canyang Study Society" and the Socialist Youth League, and organized the Hengfeng Party branch. Huang Dao and Zhou Xiufeng successively served as the branch secretary.

In summary, by the time of the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the counties of Yishan, Hengfeng, Guixi, Yushan, Shangrao, Dexing, Lepping, and Fuliang in the Gan Dongbei region almost all had Communist Party members or Party organizations.

After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Gan Dongbei region, like other regions in the country, was shrouded in white terror. Many Party members and organizations, in the situation of losing contact with higher authorities and even with each other, still consciously and bravely carried out revolutionary activities and struggles. All of this created the conditions and laid the foundation for the establishment of a regional Party organization in the Gan Dongbei region.

Therefore, the spring breeze of the Party's August 7th Conference quickly revived the vitality of the Gan Dongbei Party. In November 1927, the Gan Dongbei Party held a five-county joint conference in Jiaotou Village, Yishan County, and elected a working committee headed by comrades Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, Huang Dao, and others, which was the earliest regional Party organization in Gan Dongbei—the five-county joint conference Party committee.

The Gan Dongbei region was one of the earliest regions where Party members and organizations appeared. This is different from the situation in some places where Party members and organizations appeared only after the establishment of the revolutionary base area.

Second, there was first the people's armed forces, and then the regular Red Army; first, there was a three-in-one organization of government, military, and masses, and then it developed into a full-time regular army. The army of the Gan Dongbei base area was completely developed from the local workers' and peasants' armed forces, starting from scratch. As early as the autumn and winter of 1926, under the leadership of Comrade Fang Zhimin, Fang Yuanjie directly participated in the organization and command of an uprising to attack the Qicao Town outpost, seizing "two and a half guns." Later, it developed to more than ten guns, and guerrilla warfare began, preparing for the birth of the people's army in Gan Dongbei and accumulating experience.

After the August 7th Conference of the Party, in order to carry out armed uprisings, under the direct leadership of comrades Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, Huang Dao, and others, semi-militarized peasant armed forces were organized in dozens of villages and towns in Yishan, Hengfeng, and other places. Later, a group of active elements from the peasant revolutionary corps of the Yishan-Hengfeng uprising were selected to leave production and form a guerrilla unit, armed with dozens of guns. Soon, the peasant revolutionary corps was renamed the peasant Red Guard Corps, and the full-time guerrilla unit gradually changed its name to the Red Army. By 1929, this guerrilla unit gradually developed into a relatively large regular Red Army force, thus forming the "Jiangxi Red Army Independent Regiment." In 1930, this Red Army force was expanded into the Red 10th Army, with Zhou Jianping as the commander and Shao Shiping as the political commissar.

Looking at the birth and development process of the Gan Dongbei Red Army, we can see that the development of the army in the Gan Dongbei base area did not originate from external forces like some base areas that had no armed forces of their own, with the army mainly originating from the Autumn Harvest Uprising, Nanchang Uprising, and other external forces. It was developed from scratch, gradually establishing the armed forces of the workers and peasants, starting from the peasant revolutionary corps and gradually developing into a regular Red Army. In addition, from the functional nature of the army in the Gan Dongbei base area, it was not only a military organization but also, at the beginning, a government and mass organization. The peasant revolutionary corps was both the prototype of the Gan Dongbei Red Army and the prototype of the government. This characteristic of the Gan Dongbei army is different from that of many other places' armies.

Third, the construction of political power began with uprisings, spreading like ripples. The construction of political power in the Gan Dongbei base area began with peasant armed uprisings. The Gan Dongbei Party, based on its analysis of the political, economic, cultural, and natural conditions of the region, decided to first carry out peasant armed uprisings and establish a red government in the Yi-Heng region, where the objective conditions were relatively favorable. This was a remarkable achievement in the Gan Dongbei region, which was cut off from communication with the Jinggangshan and other regions at that time, and had no connection. This was in line with Comrade Mao Zedong's theory and practice of "armed struggle for workers and peasants in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains." However, the establishment of political power in the Gan Dongbei base area also had its own characteristics: it started with peasant uprisings. Wherever the uprisings were successful, red political power was born. The form of political power was first the peasant revolutionary corps, and then it was changed to the Soviet. The members in charge of these political organs were not appointed by higher authorities but were selected from the struggle, trusted by the masses, and produced through democratic elections. Because organizing peasant uprisings required long-term, arduous, and meticulous work, this determined that the birth of the Gan Dongbei red political power had a relatively long incubation period, and the expansion of political power was like ripples, not something that could be achieved overnight. This method is different from that of some other base areas, which did not go through peasant uprisings but relied on external armed forces to advance, overthrow local tyrants and evil gentry, overthrow reactionary rule, establish peasant associations, establish revolutionary committees, and establish Soviet political power.

From the day the Gan Dongbei base area was established, although the red political power was seriously threatened by the enemy's repeated "encirclement and suppression," the Gan Dongbei base area still managed to stand firm and even had a period of significant development. The reason for this is that the Gan Dongbei Party, in the situation of not being able to contact the central authorities for a time, being cut off from external information, having few instructions from higher authorities to follow, and knowing little about the experiences of other places, creatively formulated and implemented a series of relatively correct and distinctive policies. These policies, with distinct "Gan Dongbei characteristics," became an important symbol of the "Fang Zhimin-style" base area. These policies are important reasons for the existence and development of the Gan Dongbei base area.

First, the Gan Dongbei base area implemented a policy of uniting the majority. To solve the problem of distinguishing between enemies and friends, the Gan Dongbei region, at the beginning of the establishment of the base area, paid special attention to the land issue and adopted a land policy that was different from other regions at that time. Later, it also formulated a land law.

I remember that during the Yi-Heng uprising, the Party organization in the Yi-Heng region proposed the slogan of "canceling debts and equalizing land," leading the peasants to carry out debt cancellation, contract destruction, and fighting against local tyrants, distributing houses, grain, and valuables, and letting the peasants see immediate benefits. Especially for the peasants' universal demand for land distribution, it was immediately satisfied. (At that time, some regions only started land distribution relatively late after implementing armed struggle.) After the establishment of the Soviet government, the solution to the land problem was placed in a prominent position, and the land law was promptly promulgated. At that time, the policy for land distribution was: confiscate the land of landlords, officials, and corrupt officials, and then distribute it equally among the peasant masses. The method of distribution was: based on the village, using labor power and population as two standards, mixed and averaged distribution. For landlords, as long as they were willing to cultivate, they could also get a share of the land; for rich peasants, as long as they handed over the surplus land, they could keep a portion of good and bad land. For the land of middle peasants, it was basically left unchanged. Practice has proven that the land policy of Gan Dongbei was in line with the Party's policy of uniting the majority and the correct strategy of dealing with landlords and rich peasants. History has proven that the correct policy and strategy of the Gan Dongbei Party played a very important role in weakening the enemy's strength, strengthening the revolutionary people's strength, and consolidating the red political power.

However, the correct land policy of Gan Dongbei at the beginning was attacked and destroyed by the active followers of the Wang Ming line. The masses in the Gan Dongbei region were extremely dissatisfied, and Comrade Fang Zhimin, Shao Shiping, Huang Dao, and other comrades, as well as the broad Party members and masses of Gan Dongbei, stood up to fight and resist.

Second, the army of the Gan Dongbei base area created a set of distinctive strategies and tactics and effective methods of ideological and political work. At the beginning of the establishment of the Yi-Heng Soviet government, the enemy launched a mad attack on the red political power established on this land, attempting to strangle the newborn red political power in its cradle. The activity range of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army gradually shrank, forcing it to retreat to the area within a radius of less than 50 li around Mopanshan. In this serious situation, the Gan Dongbei Party held the significant Fangsheng Peak Conference. At the meeting, a part of the comrades, with Fang Zhimin as the representative, proposed to carry out guerrilla warfare within the base area and combine guerrilla warfare with mobile warfare.

In guerrilla warfare, the army of Gan Dongbei gradually created a set of distinctive strategies and tactics, mainly guerrilla warfare, and did not give up mobile warfare under favorable conditions. For example, at that time, we proposed strategies and tactics such as "relieving the besieged by attacking the besieger" and "avoiding the strong and attacking the weak." These strategies and tactics, we summarized them with vivid and concrete language such as "plugging holes, setting ambushes, cutting off the snake's head, cutting off the tail, fighting small battles, and taking supplements." It reflects the distinctive characteristics of Gan Dongbei guerrilla warfare and is an innovation in Gan Dongbei guerrilla warfare. I remember that Chairman Mao once told me that your strategies and tactics are all good, and we also have a few sentences that are similar to what you said. Chairman Mao's "a few sentences" refers to the military principle of "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue" the sixteen-character formula. Of course, Chairman Mao's summary is more comprehensive and scientific.

The Gan Dongbei Red Army also created a set of effective methods of ideological and political work. In the Red Army, we all had political organs at that time, with political commissars at the company and battalion levels, and political departments or political sections at the regiment level and above. Political workers were equipped from the grassroots companies to the battalion, regiment, and higher-level leadership organs, initially all called Party representatives, later called instructors at the company level, instructors at the battalion level, and political commissars and political department directors at the regiment level and above. These political workers were basically local people and had relatively high prestige among the masses and soldiers, which was conducive to ideological and political work. The focus of the work was on the companies, mainly solving the problem of "for whom to serve in the army and for whom to fight." The forms of ideological and political work were varied and lively. For example, through reminiscences and comparisons, through learning culture, performing plays, and singing songs to improve the soldiers' ideological awareness and inspire revolutionary enthusiasm; through the "soldiers' movement" to win over the surrender of White Army soldiers. This set of ideological and political work methods was neither copied from books nor copied from other base areas. It was created in the situation of no communication with other base areas and in the situation of not receiving any political books of the Red Army published by the central authorities.

Third, the Gan Dongbei base area had a flexible policy suitable for local characteristics in the economy. It put agricultural production in the first place in economic construction, which was an important policy for the economic development of Gan Dongbei. Because the Gan Dongbei base area was located in the economically backward mountainous and semi-mountainous rural areas, the natural economy of small-scale agriculture and household handicrafts was absolutely dominant, which determined that economic development must prioritize agricultural production. Only by developing agricultural production can the problems of food, clothing, sugar, paper, and various military and civilian supplies be solved, and the development of industry and commerce be promoted. It was precisely because we insisted on the policy of prioritizing agricultural production in economic construction that the military and civilians in the base area had enough to eat and wear, that the army did not weaken its combat effectiveness due to insufficient supplies, and that the entire base area was stable and the political power was consolidated.

Under the premise of agricultural development, the Gan Dongbei base area also adopted the policy of self-reliance in developing industry, establishing many military and civilian industries, such as armament factories, textile factories, etc., to meet the production and living needs of the people in the Soviet area, ensure the supply of military and civilian supplies for the Red Army, enrich the economy, and break the enemy's economic blockade.

Because the series of policies implemented by the Gan Dongbei Party were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and because the Gan Dongbei Party and people, who had undergone long-term revolutionary struggles, had firm revolutionary beliefs and tenacious fighting spirit, they finally preserved the sparks of revolution in the mountains and valleys of Gan Dongbei. The Gan Dongbei base area, in the midst of white terror, fully demonstrated its tenacious vitality and unyielding fighting spirit.

    方志敏与赣东北革命根据地
    ——纪念方志敏同志诞辰九十周年
    方志纯
    1930年1月，毛泽东同志在他的不朽篇章《星星之火，可以燎原》一文中指出：“朱德毛泽东式、方志敏式之有根据地的，有计划地建设政权的，深入土地革命的，扩大人民武装的路线是经由乡赤卫队、区赤卫大队、县赤卫总队、地方红军直至正规红军这样一套办法的，政权发展是波浪式地向前扩大的，等等的政策，无疑义地是正确的。”以后又称许“赣东北的同志们也有很好的创造，他们同样是模范工作者”。这是毛泽东同志对赣东北根据地的充分肯定和高度赞扬。
    赣东北革命根据地，是第二次国内革命战争时期一块重要的根据地，创建于1927年。它经历了一个由弋横而信江，由信江而赣东北，由赣东北而闽浙赣（皖）的大体发展过程。开始时，它是指弋阳、横峰等地建有革命政权的大约方圆六七十里的地方，叫弋横根据地，又叫以磨盘山为中心的革命根据地。以后，它的范围就超出了这些地方，其区域逐步发展扩大，先后包括赣东北的21个县、闽北的13个县、浙西（南）的21个县、皖南的17个县，达72县之多。当然，其中有不少地方是属于游击区。
    毛泽东同志为什么把赣东北革命根据地称为“方志敏式”？这当然不仅仅是因为这块根据地是方志敏、邵式平、黄道等同志领导开创的，而是有着更深刻的原因。概括起来，我想不外乎这块根据地具有独创性、开拓性、自立性、灵活性，等等。其独创性，就是赣东北党把马克思主义的普遍真理与赣东北的实际相结合，在革命实践中逐步创造了一套建党、建军、建立政权的独特做法，创造了赣东北这块前人未曾创造过的红色根据地；其开拓性，就是赣东北的党和人民群众，在进行武装夺取政权，建立红色根据地这一史无前例的事业时，所表现出来的极大热情和坚韧不拔的意志，勇往直前的精神；其自立性，就是赣东北根据地在当时那种经济、政治、文化、自然环境里，无现成模式所仿效，无外来支援所仰赖，艰苦奋斗，自强自立；其灵活性，就是赣东北的党善于从当地的实际出发，创造出了一整套行之有效的灵活的方针政策。
    这里，我想通过对赣东北根据地一些重要史实的回忆与思考，不揣浅薄，具体谈谈我对“方志敏式”根据地的看法，作为我对方志敏九十诞辰的纪念。
    赣东北根据地的创建，和井冈山等根据地一样，应该说它们都是马克思列宁主义和本国革命实践相结合的产物，都是农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的成功尝试。但是，它的创建又具有和当时其他根据地不同的特点，这可以从以下三点得到说明：
    一、先有党的组织的建立，而后才有根据地；开始为少数知识分子党员，而后大部分为农民党员。早在1922年方志敏在上海时，经赵醒侬介绍，加入了中国共产主义青年团，1924年3月又转为中共党员——成为赣东北地区最早的党员之一。接着，方志敏从上海回到家乡弋阳县漆工镇，发展了一些进步青年入党，并组成了党小组。到年底，又将党小组扩大为临时党支部，方志敏任书记。
    1926年北京“三·一八”惨案后，在北师大读书的邵式平同志因积极参加和领导学生的革命运动，被反动政府通缉，呆在北京很危险，便潜回江西，从事农民运动。后来，他来到弋阳，在县城秘密开会，正式组织了弋县第一个党支部，其时为1926年秋。
    在中共弋阳党支部成立前后，早在北师大读书时就入了党的黄道同志，根据党的指示，在原来的“岑阳学会”和社会主义青年团中，吸收了一批先进分子入党，并组建了横峰中共党支部。黄道、邹秀峰先后担任过支部书记。
    总之，到1927年大革命失败前夕，赣东北地区的弋阳、横峰、贵溪、铅山、上饶、德兴、乐平、浮梁等各县，差不多都有了中共党员或中共党的组织。
    大革命失败以后，赣东北地区和全国其它地区一样，笼罩着白色恐怖。许多党员和党组织在与上级失掉联系、甚至彼此之间也失掉联系的情况下，仍自觉地、勇敢地进行革命活动和革命斗争。所有这些，都为建立赣东北地区性的党组织创造了条件，奠定了基础。
    因此，党的“八七”会议的春风吹来，赣东北党很快恢复了蓬勃的生机。1927年11月间，赣东北党在弋阳县窖头村举行了五县联席会议，选举了以方志敏、邵式平、黄道等同志为首的工作委员会，即五县联席会议党委——赣东北最早的地区性党组织。
    赣东北地区，是党员和党的组织出现较早的地区，它跟有些地方在革命根据地建立以后才有党员和党的组织的情形，是不相同的。
    二、先有群众武装，而后才有正规红军；先是政权、军事、群众三位一体的组织，而后才发展为脱产的正规军队。赣东北根据地的军队完全是在当地的工农武装的基础上，白手起家发展起来的。早在1926年秋冬，在方志敏同志的领导下，由方远杰直接参与组织指挥，举行了一次攻打漆工镇派出所的暴动，夺得了“两条半枪”。以后发展到十几支枪，并开始了游击战争，为赣东北人民军队的诞生作了准备，积累了经验。
    党的“八·七”会议之后，为了进行武装暴动，在方志敏、邵式平、黄道等同志的直接领导下，在弋阳、横峰等地的数十个村坊里组织起了半军事化的农民武装。接着，从弋横起义的农民革命团中，挑选了一部分起义的积极分子，脱离生产，成立游击队，掌握着大约几十条枪的武装。不久，农民革命团改称农民赤卫队，而脱产的游击队则逐渐改称为红军，到1929年，这支游击队逐渐发展为规模比较大的正规红军武装，于是有了“江西红军独立团”的番号。1930年，这支红军队伍扩编为红十军，军长是周建屏，政委由邵式平兼任。
    纵观赣东北红军的诞生发展过程，可以看到，赣东北根据地军队的发展，并不像有的根据地自己原先并没有什么武装，军队主要起源于秋收起义、南昌起义等外来队伍；它是在无外来的一兵一卒的情况下，白手起家，逐步建立起工农自己的武装，并从农民革命团开始，逐渐发展为正规红军的。另外，从赣东北根据地军队的职能性质来看，它不光是军事组织，而且在开始的时候还是政权组织、群众组织。农民革命团既是赣东北红军的雏形，又是政权的雏形。赣东北军队这一特点，是其它许多地方军队所不相同的。
    三、政权的建设始于暴动，形似涟漪。赣东北根据地的政权建设始于农民武装暴动。赣东北党根据对本地区政治、经济、文化、自然条件的分析，决定在客观条件比较有利的弋横地区首先进行农民武装暴动，建立红色政权。这在当时赣东北地区与井冈山等地区音讯隔绝，毫无联系的情况下，无疑是一个了不起的创举，这与毛泽东同志选择罗霄山脉中段进行“工农武装割据”的理论和实践，是不谋而合的。但是，赣东北根据地政权的创建，又有它自身的特点：它是从农民暴动开始的。凡是暴动取得了成功的地方，红色政权也随之而诞生。政权的形式，先是农民革命团，而后才改为苏维埃。在这些政权机关掌权的成员，不是由上级委派的，而是从斗争中涌现出来、群众信得过、并且是经过民主选举产生的。由于组织农民暴动，需要经过长期的、艰苦细致的工作，这就决定了赣东北红色政权的诞生，有一个较长时间的孕育过程，政权的扩大形似涟漪，而并非一朝一夕就可以取得成功。这种方式和其它有的根据地是不同的，其它的根据地不是通过农民暴动，而是通过依靠外来武装开进来，打倒土豪劣绅，推翻反动统治，建立农民协会，建立革命委员会，建立苏维埃政权。
    从赣东北根据地创建的那一天起，虽然由于敌人的不断疯狂“围剿”，红色政权受到严重的威胁。但是，赣东北根据地毕竟战胜了险恶冷峻的环境，站住脚跟，并且还有过较大的发展时期。究其原因，就是赣东北党在当时一度没有与中央联系上，一度与外界信息阻隔，很少有上头的指示精神可供遵循，别地的经验又很少知道的情况下，创造性地制订和实行了一系列比较正确，比较有特色的方针政策，这些方针政策，富有鲜明的“赣东北特色”，成为“方志敏式”根据地的重要标志。这些方针政策，是赣东北根据地得以存在和发展的重要原因。
    首先，赣东北根据地实行了一条团结大多数的路线。为了解决好分清敌我友这个问题，赣东北地区在创建根据地之初，就特别注重土地问题，并采取了现在看来有别于其它地区的土地政策。以后，还制定了土地法。
    记得，在弋横暴动时，弋横地区的党组织就提出了“平债均分田地”的主张，并领导农民开展平债、毁契和打土豪的斗争，分房屋、分粮食、分浮财，让农民及时得到看得见的实惠。特别对于农民普遍的分田分地的要求，立即予以满足。（当时有的地区，分配土地却是在实行武装割据之后较晚才开始的。）等到苏维埃政权建立起来后，又把解决土地问题放在首要的位置，及时颁布了土地法。当时，分配土地的政策是：将豪绅地主、贪官污吏的土地没收，然后平均分配给农民群众。分配的办法是：以村为单位，按劳动力和人口两个标准，混合平均分配。对于地主，只要他们本人愿意耕种，也可以分得一份土地；对于富农，只要把超过部分的土地拿出来，好田坏田各留一部分就行了。对于中农的土地，基本保持不动。实践证明，赣东北的这套土地政策是符合党的团结大多数的路线和正确对待地主、富农的策略的。历史证明，赣东北党的这一正确政策和策略，对于削弱敌人的力量，壮大革命人民的力量，巩固红色政权，是起了很重要的作用的。
    但是，赣东北开始时的正确的土地政策，却遭到王明路线的积极追随者的攻击和破坏。赣东北地区的群众极为不满，方志敏、邵式平、黄道等同志以及赣东北的广大党员、群众，奋起进行斗争和抵制。
    第二，赣东北根据地的军队创造了一整套具有特色的战略战术和行之有效的思想政治工作方法。弋横苏维埃政权建立之初，敌人曾对建立在这块土地上的红色政权发动了疯狂的进攻，妄图把新生的红色政权扼杀在摇篮里。工农革命军的活动范围日益缩小，被迫退到方圆不到50里的磨盘山周围。在此严重的形势下，赣东北党召开了意义重大的方胜峰会议。会上，以方志敏为代表的一部分同志，提出在根据地内开展游击斗争，并把游击战同运动战结合起来的主张。
    在游击战中，赣东北的军队，逐渐创造了一整套具有特色的以游击战为主、在有利的条件下不放弃运动战的战略战术原则。比如，当时我们提出了“围魏救赵”“避实就虚”等战略战术。这些战略战术，我们曾用“扎口子，打埋伏，斩蛇头，切尾巴，打小仗，吃补药”等生动形象的语言来概括。它体现了赣东北游击战的鲜明特色，是赣东北游击战中的一个独创。记得，毛主席曾经跟我说过，你们这些战略战术都很好，我们也有几句话，和你们讲的差不多。毛主席讲的“也有几句话”是指“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的十六字诀的军事原则。当然，毛主席总结的更全面更科学。
    赣东北红军还创造了一整套行之有效的思想政治工作的方法。在红军中，当时我们都设有政治机关，连、营有政治干事，团以上有政治处或政治部；政工人员从基层连队，到营、团以上领导机关都配备了，开始时都称党代表，后来连叫指导员，营叫教导员，团以上叫政治委员及政治部主任。这些政工人员基本上都是当地人，在群众和士兵中都比较有威信，有利于做思想政治工作。工作的重点是放在连队，主要解决“为谁当兵，为谁打仗”的问题。思想政治工作的形式多种多样，生动活泼。比如，通过回忆对比，通过学文化、演戏、唱歌来提高战士的思想觉悟，激发革命热情；通过“士兵运动”来争取白军士兵投诚。这套思想政治工作的方法，既不是从书本上照抄过来的，也不是从别的根据地照搬过来的，它是在与其它根据地不通信息的情况下，是在中央出版的各种红军的政治书籍一本也没有收到的情况下创造出来的。
    第三，赣东北根据地在经济上有一套灵活的适合当地特点的方针。把农业生产放在经济建设的首位，这是赣东北经济发展的一条重要的方针。因为，赣东北根据地处在经济落后的山区、半山区的农村，小农业和家庭手工业相结合的自然经济占绝对优势，这就决定了经济发展必须把农业生产放在首要的地位。只有发展了农业生产，才能解决粮食问题，以及衣服、食糖、纸张等日用品的原料和各种军需民用品的供给问题，才能推动工业和财贸事业的发展。当时，正是我们坚持了把农业生产放在经济建设的首位的方针，才使得根据地的军民吃得饱、穿得暖，才使得军队没有因给养不足而削弱战斗力，才使得整个根据地人心安定，政权巩固。
    在农业发展的前提下，赣东北根据地还采取自力更生兴办工业的方针，办了不少军事工业和民用工业，比如，兵工厂、纺织厂等等，满足了苏区人民群众生产和生活的需要，保障了红军军需的给养和供给，充裕了经济，粉碎了敌人的经济封锁。
    由于赣东北党所实行的这一系列方针政策深入人心，由于经受了长期革命斗争考验的赣东北党和人民有着坚定的革命信念和顽强的斗争精神，终于把革命的火种保存在赣东北的千山万壑间。赣东北根据地在白色恐怖中，充分显示了它顽强的生命力和不屈的斗争精神。
