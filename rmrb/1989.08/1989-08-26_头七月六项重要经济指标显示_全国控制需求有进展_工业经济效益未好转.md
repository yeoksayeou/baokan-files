    The first seven months' six key economic indicators show that the country has made progress in controlling demand, but industrial economic benefits have not improved. Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 26th: Reporter Zhang Guorong reports: The National Bureau of Statistics, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China jointly released important economic indicator statistics for the regions today, showing that from January to July, China's fixed asset investment continued to be compressed, credit conditions were better than last year, and the growth of workers' wages has slowed, but industrial economic benefits have not improved.

    In the first seven months, the completion amount of fixed asset investment by state-owned enterprises was 78.6 billion yuan, a decrease of 7.9% compared to the same period last year. Among these, the completion amount of local projects was 41.65 billion yuan, a decrease of 9.7% compared to the same period last year.

    As of the end of July, the total amount of bank loans nationwide was 1083.8 billion yuan, an increase of 28.7 billion yuan from the beginning of the year, but 46.7 billion yuan less than the same period last year. This indicates that the tightening policy has been effective.

    The total wages of workers nationwide from January to July were 136.97 billion yuan, an increase of 20.6% compared to the same period last year. Looking at the cumulative growth rate of each month, the growth rate shows a decreasing trend month by month, and the growth of consumption funds has also been curbed.

From January to July, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises with independent accounting was 10,901 yuan per person, an increase of 3.4% compared to the same period last year. Qinghai Province showed negative growth.

    The comparable product cost continues to rise. From January to July, the comparable product cost of state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises increased by 18.7%, an increase of 10.7 percentage points compared to the same period last year.
