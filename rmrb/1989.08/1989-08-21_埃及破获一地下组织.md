Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 21st.

Egypt recently uncovered a secret organization aiming to overthrow the current government through armed means. The organization, which is affiliated with Iran and follows extremist Shia Islam, has been apprehended with 52 of its members arrested.

The Egyptian Supreme State Security Prosecutor accused the secret organization of spreading extremist Shia ideology and attempting to use force to establish a Shia regime in Egypt. Over the past three years, members of the organization have taken turns traveling to Syria and Iran for ideological and military training. They planned to carry out sabotage activities against the American, Israeli, and the Iraqi, Saudi, and Kuwaiti embassies in Egypt.

The leader of the organization is a Saudi national named Abu Iman, who resides in Damascus. He directed and funded four Egyptian Shia extremists to return to Egypt to develop the organization. Among the members is a doctor who once treated Iran's leader Khomeini.

The Egyptian Minister of Interior ordered the pursuit and capture of the remaining 12 fugitive members of the organization.
