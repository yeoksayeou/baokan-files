The United Nations World Food Programme has provided 340,000 tons of wheat and 558 tons of butter to aid in the agricultural, pastoral, and forestry development of the Lhasa Valley in Tibet. This marks the first time Tibet has received economic assistance from a United Nations organization.

The project to aid Tibet was approved and initiated by the World Food Programme in 1987. In May 1988, officials from the Programme visited Tibet to conduct on-site inspections and assessments. They initially determined that the project area in the Lhasa Valley would cover 5163 square kilometers, with a development scale of 21 sub-projects to be carried out in two phases over five years. The project includes irrigation development, land leveling, afforestation, and grass planting. The formal agreement was signed in July of this year, and implementation has begun.

It is reported that during the project's implementation, more than 12,000 surplus rural laborers in Lhasa will have employment opportunities, and 270,000 people will receive professional technical training. The 12.4 million workdays used during this period will be compensated by the World Food Programme with the provided wheat and butter. According to evaluations by domestic and foreign experts, after the implementation of this project, the agricultural, pastoral, and forestry industries in the Lhasa Valley will achieve significant economic benefits, and farmers will gain substantial advantages.

    联合国粮食署提供援助
    拉萨河谷开发计划实施
    本报拉萨8月12日电　记者刘伟报道：由联合国世界粮食计划署援助的34万吨小麦、558吨黄油将用于西藏拉萨河谷的农牧林业开发。这是西藏首次接受联合国组织经济援助。
    援助西藏的这一项目是1987年经世界粮食计划署批准立项的。1988年5月，该署官员来藏实地考察、评估，初步确定拉萨河谷项目规划区为5163平方公里，开发建设规模为21个分项目，分两期执行，5年完成，发展灌溉，平整土地，植树种草等。今年7月，正式签署协议并开始实施。
    据悉，项目实施期间，拉萨1.2万余农村剩余劳力可获就业机会，27万人次将得到专业技术培训。其间使用的1240万个工日，均由世界粮食计划署以所援小麦、黄油代帐。经国内外专家评估，该项目实施后，拉萨河谷农牧林业将取得显著经济效益，农民可获较大实惠。
