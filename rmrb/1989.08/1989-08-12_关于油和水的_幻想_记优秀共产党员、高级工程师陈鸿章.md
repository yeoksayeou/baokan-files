Ten years ago, he had a fantasy: one day, water could replace oil.

What a naive fantasy!

Who would have thought that he would turn this fantasy into reality? He developed water-based cleaning agents, lubricants, and rust inhibitors, ending China's reliance on oil for cleaning, lubricating, and rust-proofing machinery in industrial production. This has significantly contributed to energy conservation and environmental protection, earning him the National Invention Award and the Eureka Silver Medal at the Brussels World Invention Expo.

He is Chen Hongzhang, a 48-year-old senior engineer and outstanding Communist Party member.

Some say that science equals fantasy plus diligence plus luck. Chen Hongzhang seems to have all three. He loves to fantasize, works diligently, and is fortunate to have lived in the era of reform and opening up, allowing him to fully utilize and showcase his intelligence, strive, cultivate, and contribute.

In 1966, Chen Hongzhang graduated from the Chemistry Department of Tianjin Normal University and was assigned to a factory for re-education. He learned that China's machinery manufacturing industry lacked ideal cleaning, lubricating, and rust-proofing materials. This not only affected the appearance and quality of the products but also consumed millions of tons of petroleum products annually for cleaning, lubricating, and rust-proofing. He had a sudden idea: what if water could replace oil?

He was too naive. As a technician in a small factory, turning his fantasy into reality was nearly impossible under the conditions at the time.

In 1978, the spring of science brought a turning point in Chen Hongzhang's life—he returned to his unit and was assigned to the Tianjin Machine Tool Research Institute. One day, while washing clothes, he noticed a familiar fact: detergent mixed with water can remove stains from clothes. He wondered if some chemical additive mixed with water could replace oil to clean the dirt off machine tools.

He began his relentless exploration. In the library, he diligently searched through various materials; in the lab, he worked like a man possessed, conducting experiments and analyses. Time and again, he failed. Some called him crazy, others laughed at him, and well-meaning friends advised him, "Stop dreaming." He paid no heed, continuing his efforts in the library and lab. Finally, he succeeded. After tens of thousands of experiments, Chen Hongzhang screened out more than 3,000 formulas and invented the IS-A cold heavy oil dirt chemical cleaning agent.

The hypothesis "X + water = oil" was proven.

Soon, he refined and formulated the TF-J type water-based rust inhibitor from an industrial waste material. Its rust-proofing performance and technical indicators exceeded the American MIL standards and were superior to famous brands from the U.S., Japan, and the UK. He also successfully developed the JH type water-based lubricant, filling a domestic gap and solving the problem of relying on imports for high-grade cutting lubricants. The water-based "three agents" series of products achieved a major breakthrough in mechanical cleaning, lubrication, and rust-proofing. Incomplete statistics show that in actual production, using the "three agents" to replace various oils saves more than 20,000 tons of oil, 7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and hundreds of millions of yuan in costs annually.

He succeeded. His hard work was recognized by society, and he was promoted to senior engineer. Various honors followed: outstanding Communist Party member, Tianjin's top labor model, and the National May Day Labor Medal. However, Chen Hongzhang was not satisfied with his research achievements. He decided to make greater efforts to quickly turn his research results into productive forces.

He embarked on another arduous journey, dedicated to the promotion, development, and application of the "three agents." He visited more than 80% of the machine tool factories in Tianjin, teaching the application technology of the "three agents." He also spared no effort in guiding national "three agents" production factories to produce high-quality "three agents" products. He helped several factories in Huangshi, Wuxi, Langfang, and Tianjin that were on the verge of bankruptcy to produce "three agents" products, quickly turning losses into profits and reviving them. He assisted Shandong, Qiqihar, Liaoning, and Yunnan in developing the "three agents," achieving success and creating social benefits of over 50 million yuan.

    关于油和水的“幻想”
    ——记优秀共产党员、高级工程师陈鸿章
    本报记者　梁小琴
    十年前，他就幻想，幻想有一天，水能代替油。
    多么天真的幻想！
    谁想到，他竟把幻想变成了现实。他研制的水基清洗剂、水基润滑剂、水基防锈剂，结束了我国工业生产靠用油对机械进行清洗、润滑、防锈封存的历史，为节约能源，减少环境污染作出了巨大的贡献，获得国家发明奖和布鲁塞尔世界发明博览会尤里卡银奖。
    他，就是48岁的高级工程师、优秀共产党员陈鸿章。
    有人说，科学＝幻想＋勤奋＋运气。陈鸿章可以说是三者兼备，他爱幻想，又很勤奋，还幸运地赶上了改革开放的好时代，使他有机会充分运用、施展聪明才智，去拚搏，去耕耘，去奉献。
    1966年，陈鸿章从天津师范学院化学系毕业，被分配到一家工厂接受再教育。他了解到，我国机械加工业，由于没有理想的清洗、润滑、防锈材料，不仅影响了产品的外观和质量，一年还要消耗几千万吨石油产品，用来清洗、润滑、封存防锈……他突发奇想：要是水能代替油，该有多好？
    他太天真了，一个小工厂的技术员，要把幻想变成现实，在当时的条件下，谈何容易！
    1978年，科学的春天给陈鸿章的命运带来了转机——他归队了，被安排到天津市机床研究所。一天，他在洗衣服时，发现了一个人们早就熟知的事实：洗衣粉加水，可以去掉衣服上的污渍。他想，能不能用某种化学添加剂加水来代替油，清洗掉机床上的污垢呢？
    他开始了苦苦的探索。在图书馆，他孜孜不倦地查阅各种资料；在实验室，他着了魔似地化验、分析。一次次地试验，一次次地失败。有人说他痴，有人笑他傻，好心的朋友劝他“别做梦了”。他没有理会，锲而不舍，再去图书馆，再去实验室……终于，他成功了。经过上万次试验，陈鸿章筛选出3000多个配方，发明了IS—A常温重油垢化学清洗剂。
    “X＋水＝油”的猜想得到证明。
    随即，他又从一种工业废料中精炼配制出TF—J型水基防锈剂，其防锈性能和技术指标超过美国的MIL标准，优于美、日、英的名牌产品。他还研制成功了JH型水基润滑剂，填补了国内空白，解决了高级切削润滑剂依赖进口的难题。水基“三剂”系列产品，实现了机械清洗、润滑、防锈的重大突破。据不完全统计，在实际生产中，用“三剂”代替各种油料使用，一年就节油2万多吨，节电700多万度，节支上千万元。
    他成功了。他的劳动得到了社会的承认，他被晋升为高级工程师，各种荣誉也纷至沓来：优秀共产党员，天津市特等劳动模范，全国“五一劳动奖章”……。可陈鸿章并不满足于已经取得的科研成果，他决心作出更大的努力，把研究成果尽快地转化为生产力。
    他又开始了艰苦的跋涉，致力于“三剂”的推广、开发和应用。他走遍了天津市机械行业80％以上的厂家，传授“三剂”的应用技术。还竭尽全力指导全国“三剂”生产厂家生产优质的“三剂”产品。他先后扶植黄石、无锡、廊坊、天津几家濒临倒闭的企业投产“三剂”产品，使这些厂家迅速扭亏为盈，起死回生。他帮助山东、齐齐哈尔、辽宁、云南等地发展“三剂”，获得成功，创造社会效益5000多万元。
