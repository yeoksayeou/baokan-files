    With Power and Money in Hand, Anti-Corruption Must Be Strengthened
    Guangzhou Railway Bureau Establishes Regulations to Restrain Itself
    Forms a Network of Supervision by Party Members and the Public

    GUANGZHOU, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) — The central government has given us more authority by "loosening the reins," and we must "build a cage" to restrain ourselves. This is the important measure taken by the Guangzhou Railway Bureau to promote the construction of a clean government within the entire system over the past two years since it implemented comprehensive economic contracting.

    The Guangzhou Railway Bureau was the first in the country to implement comprehensive economic contracting in 1987. Since then, the bureau has delegated authority and benefits to its subordinate divisions and grassroots units, allowing these units to retain profits, equipment renovation, and major repair funds exceeding 10 million yuan annually. As the authority of grassroots cadres increased and the amount of money they handled grew, without corresponding restraints, there would be corruption involving the exchange of power and money. Therefore, Bureau Director Yang Qihua proposed to all levels of cadres in the system to "build a cage" to restrain themselves.

    Over the past two years, the bureau has established 13 comprehensive economic contracting macro-control measures and cadre integrity regulations, including "Strictly Implementing Transportation Policies and Transportation Discipline," "Strengthening the Management of Bonuses," and "Regulations on the Salaries and Bonuses of Leading Cadres." These regulations have placed all cadres, especially leading cadres, in a "cage." At the same time, the bureau established an inspection office, a reporting center, and 63 complaint hotlines, set up 187 party wind supervision boxes, and appointed 1,800 party wind and road wind supervisors, forming a network of supervision by party members and the public both inside and outside the bureau. Each level of cadres also receives a vote of confidence from the representatives of the annual congress and has their bonus income accounts checked by representatives elected by the workers.

    Due to these measures, the construction of a clean government among cadres in the entire system has been effective. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company under the bureau has, over the years, contracted construction projects worth more than 400 million yuan and signed more than 70 economic contracts with foreign companies, with a transaction amount of more than 200 million Hong Kong dollars. None of the 186 cadres involved in these economic activities have been found to have engaged in bribery or other illegal activities. More than 100 employees who went to Hong Kong and abroad for business have not been found to have violated discipline. In the first half of this year, 845 cadres in the entire system refused bribes, amounting to more than 130,000 yuan.

    手中有权钱　更须反腐败
    广州铁路局制订规章约束自己
    形成党内外群众监督网络
    本报广州电　中央给我们放权“解绳子”，我们要“编笼子”约束自己。这是广州铁路局实行全面经济承包两年多来，用以促进全系统干部廉政建设的一个重要手段。
    广州铁路局1987年在全路率先实行全面经济承包。自此，路局对所属各分局和站段基层单位实施放权让利，使基层单位光是留利、设备改造和大修等的自有资金每年逾千万元。基层干部手中的权大了，过手的钱多了，如果没有相应的约束措施，就会出现拿权力和金钱作交易的腐败现象。为此，局长杨其华向全局系统各级干部提出要自己“编笼子”约束自己。
    两年多来，这个局先后“编”了《严格执行运输政策和运输纪律》、《加强奖金管理的规定》、《领导干部工资奖励规定》等13个承包宏观控制办法和干部廉洁规定，把全局系统干部特别是领导干部，一个个推入“笼子”。同时相应成立监察处、举报中心和投诉电话63个，还设置党风监督箱187个，聘请党风路风监督员1800名，形成党内外和路内外群众监督网络。各级干部还要受一年一度的职代会代表投信任票，受职工选出的代表查奖金收入帐。
    由于采取了上述措施，全路局系统干部的廉政建设卓有成效。该局属下的广深铁路公司，几年来发包的基建工程4亿多元，与外商签订经济合同70多项，成交额达2亿多港元，参与这些经济活动的186名科以上干部，没有发现贪污受贿等违法行为；100多名到香港和出国联系业务的工作人员，没有发现违反纪律现象。全路局系统，今年上半年，拒收贿赂的干部就有845人次，金额达13万多元。
