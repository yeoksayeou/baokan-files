The world's largest particle accelerator, the "LEP" (Large Electron-Positron Collider) electron-positron collider, which began operating in mid-July, successfully achieved electron-positron collisions on the night of August 13th. The total energy at the time of collision was 91 billion electron volts. The experiment produced a "Z" particle just 16 minutes after it began. This achievement will play a crucial role in Europe maintaining and developing its leading position in particle physics research over the next 10 years. More than 1,500 scientists and researchers from around the world will study the changes that occur after electron-positron collisions to explore the deepest structure of matter and uncover the mysteries of the universe's origins.

The LEP collider project, with a total investment of 1.2 billion Swiss francs, began construction in September 1983 and was completed this July. It is located on the border between Switzerland and France. The main structure, the storage ring, is a 27-kilometer-long, 3.8-meter-diameter circular tunnel that crosses the border between the two countries four times. The storage ring consists of 8 arc sections, each buried between 50 and 170 meters underground. Inside the storage ring are 60,000 tons of various equipment and instruments and 5,388 magnets. As the operating level improves, the maximum energy of the electron-positron collisions at LEP will reach 200 billion electron volts by 1994.

In late July, electron and positron beams were injected into the storage ring from the accelerator, traveling in opposite directions at speeds close to the speed of light (270,000 kilometers per second) and colliding at predetermined times and locations. The explosive heat generated during the collision is equivalent to 4 billion times the temperature on the surface of the sun (6,000 degrees Celsius). Scientists will use this explosive experiment to simulate the conditions of the universe's big bang billions of years ago, studying various new phenomena that appear through detectors installed in four experimental areas, searching for new particles, and exploring the most fundamental structure of the universe. Experts at the European Nuclear Research Center believe that "this is one of the most significant scientific experiments of the century."

The current primary task of the LEP collider is to conduct in-depth research on the "Z" particle. Scientists had predicted that among the four fundamental forces governing the universe—gravity, electromagnetism, strong interaction, and weak interaction—the electromagnetic force and weak interaction are unified. In 1983, scientists at the European Nuclear Research Center discovered the "Z" particle and proved that it is the mediator particle between electromagnetic force and weak interaction, thus confirming that electromagnetic force and weak interaction are "deeply unified within the electroweak system."

Currently, only the European Nuclear Research Center and the United States can produce "Z" particles, but the quantity produced is far from sufficient for experimental needs. Therefore, the ability to mass-produce "Z" particles is crucial for in-depth research on the particle's mass, lifetime, spin, decay, and other characteristics, as well as its involvement in interactions, and for the best exploration of the electroweak system and further uncovering the basic laws of the universe's motion. According to experts at the European Nuclear Research Center, it took the United States two years from the operation of the collider to the production of "Z" particles, and currently, it can produce at most 10 "Z" particles per day. The LEP collider took only four weeks from the injection of the first electron beam to the production of "Z" particles, and it is expected that in the near future, it will be able to produce several thousand "Z" particles per day.

Scientists also hope that through the LEP collider experiments, they can address other major issues in the exploration of the structure of matter, such as further clarifying the types of light particles like neutrinos and the total number of particle "families," discovering the sixth "quark" (QUARK, or quark) and other new particles that have been predicted but not yet realized, experimentally verifying the origin of the particle mass referred to as the "Higgs" phenomenon (HIGGS) in physics, and gaining a deeper understanding of the strong interaction, among others. The European Nuclear Research Center, which includes 14 European countries, was established in 1954 with its headquarters in Geneva. Among the current researchers, in addition to 3,200 scientists from member countries, there are more than 4,300 researchers from renowned universities and laboratories around the world, including over 70 from China.

    欧洲“莱泼”对撞机试验成功
    新华社日内瓦8月14日电　（记者向奎观）欧洲核子研究中心今天下午在这里宣布，7月中旬投入运转的世界上最大的粒子加速器——“莱泼”（LEP）电子对撞机已于8月13日夜间成功地实现正负电子对撞试验，对撞时的总能量为910亿电子伏，试验开始16分钟后就生产出“Z”粒子。这一成果对欧洲在今后10年保持和发展其在粒子物理学研究方面的世界领先地位将起重要作用。来自世界各地的1500多名科学家和研究人员，将根据正负电子对撞后发生的变化，研究物质的最深层结构、揭开宇宙诞生的奥秘。
    总投资为12亿瑞士法郎的“莱泼”对撞机工程1983年9月动工，今年7月建成，位于瑞士和法国边境。主体工程——储存环是一条长27公里、直径3.8米、4次越过两国国界的环形隧道。储存环由8个弧区组成，分别离地面50米至170米。储存环内安装的各种设备和仪器重6万吨、磁铁5388根。随着运转水平不断提高，“莱泼”对撞机正负电子对撞的最大能量到1994年将达到2000亿电子伏。
    7月下旬，正负电子束分别从加速器注入储存环，循着相反方向，以接近光的速度（27万公里／秒）在选定的时刻和地点相撞。对撞时产生的爆炸热力相当于太阳表面温度（6000摄氏度）的4亿倍。科学家们将利用这个爆炸实验，模拟宇宙在若干亿年前大爆炸时一刹那间的情景，通过安装在4个实验区内的探测器研究出现的各种新现象，寻找新粒子，探索宇宙的最基本结构。欧洲核子研究中心的专家们认为，“这是本世纪末最重大的科学实验之一。”
    “莱泼”对撞机当前的首要任务是深入研究“Z”粒子。科学家曾预言，在支配宇宙运动的4种基本力，即万有引力、电磁力、强相互作用力和弱相互作用力中，电磁力和弱相互作用力之间是统一的。1983年，欧洲核子研究中心的科学家们发现了“Z”粒子，并证明它是电磁力和弱相互作用力之间统一的媒介粒子，从而证实了电磁力和弱作用力是“深刻地统一在电弱体系内的”。
    目前，世界上能生产“Z”粒子的只有欧洲核子研究中心和美国，但生产的数量远不能满足实验的需要。因此，能否大量生产“Z”粒子对深入研究该粒子的质量、寿命、自旋、衰变等特性以及它参与的相互作用、对最佳地探索电弱体系、进一步揭开宇宙运动的基本规律具有不可忽视的意义。据欧洲核子研究中心专家介绍，美国从对撞机运转到生产“Z”粒子花了两年时间，目前每天最多只能生产10个“Z”粒子。“莱泼”对撞机从注入第一束正电子到生产“Z”粒子，只用了4个星期，而且预计不久的将来每天可生产几千个“Z”粒子。
    科学家还期待通过“莱泼”对撞机的实验，解决人类探索物质结构奥秘所面临的其它重大课题，例如，进一步明确中微子等轻粒子的类型和粒子“家族”的总数，发现人们已有预见但至今尚未变成现实的第6个“夸克”（QUARK，即层子）等新粒子，用实验证实物理上称之“黑格斯”现象（HIGGS）的粒子质量的起源，深入了解强相互作用力等等。有14个欧洲国家参加的欧洲核子研究中心成立于1954年，总部设在日内瓦。现有研究人员中，除来自成员国的3200名科学家外，还有来自世界各著名大学和实验室的4300多位科研人员，其中70多位来自中国。
