Xinhua News Agency reports that a study by sociologists on 1,441 rural households in six provinces and municipalities reveals that the majority of farmers' marriage circles do not exceed 25 kilometers. 84.71% of farmers choose spouses within their own county, 56.98% choose within their own township, and 30% choose within their own village.

This social phenomenon has attracted the attention of relevant experts. They say that for the same species, distant mating results in offspring with greater advantages, while close mating results in fewer advantages. This has been proven by eugenics and evolutionary theory. Gao Caijin, director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Family and Marriage Research Institute, conducted a survey on the marriage situation of farmers in Fuyu City, Heilongjiang Province. The survey found that the proportion of marriages within the same village and township is higher than the national average for rural samples. At the same time, the proportion of households with mental disabilities is also high, reaching 1,771 households.

    多数农民通婚圈不超过25公里
    本报讯　据新华社报道，社会学研究者对全国六省市1441户农民家庭的调查表明，绝大多数农民的通婚圈不超过25公里。84.71％的农民择偶范围不出县，56.98％的农民不出乡，30％的农民不出村。
    这一社会现象引起了有关专家的关注。他们说，同种生物远缘交配，后代显现优势大，反过来显现的优势就小，这早已被优生学和进化论所证实。黑龙江省家庭婚姻研究所所长高彩芹，对本省富锦市农民的婚配状况作了调查，发现这里同村、同乡婚配的比例高于全国农村抽样调查的平均值，与此同时，痴呆傻户的比例也高，达到1771户。
