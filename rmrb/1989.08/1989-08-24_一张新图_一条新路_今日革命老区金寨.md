    A New Picture, A New Path
    – Today's Revolutionary Old District of Jinzhai

    Recently, old Red Army soldiers returning to their hometown of Jinzhai County from Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, and other places have all said: The mountains of Jinzhai are greener, the water is clearer, and the people's faces are rosy. What rich implications these changes hold!

    Ten years ago, Jinzhai was on the minds of so many people. In 1977, Red Army veteran Lin Yueqin returned to her hometown of Jinzhai's Nanxi and saw her fellow villagers, their faces gaunt and emaciated, and she sighed deeply, "Thirty years have passed, and the lives of the mountain people have not changed much!" After this, the Party and the state sent relief grain, money, and clothing to Jinzhai. A responsible official of Jinzhai County said, "The state's support for us to get out of poverty is to boost our morale. We cannot rely on 'blood transfusions' to live. We must rely on developing production and resolutely get out of the predicament of economic backwardness." They utilized the advantages of the mountainous area and decided to establish six major economic pillars: sericulture, chestnuts, tea, livestock, fisheries, and edible fungi, and implemented large-scale operations. At the same time, they introduced a bold decision to help the poor on a large scale: mobilize 100 scientific and technological personnel to go to the countryside, take on 10 scientific and technological projects, and in three years, help 6,000 peasant households get out of poverty.

    Now, Jinzhai has initially established 12 production bases for sericulture, chestnuts, and other products. Particularly noteworthy is the successful development of the cocoon silk series, by the end of 1987, the entire county had opened up 70,000 mu of mulberry gardens, producing 43,000 dan of cocoons annually, and established 15 enterprises for reeling, weaving, dyeing, and silk carpet weaving, with an annual output value of 111 million yuan and creating over 20 million yuan in taxes. Afforestation and reforestation, with an increase of hundreds of thousands of mu each year, have already established a forest base of tens of thousands of mu of Chinese fir. More than 10 million chestnut seedlings have been successfully grafted, and the county's forest coverage rate has reached over 35%. After two years of scientific and technological poverty alleviation, more than 5,000 peasant households have emerged from the abyss of poverty, and even the most remote mountain areas have basically solved the problem of people's basic needs.

    Jinzhai's progress lies in its spirit, in its morale. Over the past ten years, the people of Jinzhai have forged ahead with great strides, drawing a new picture on this glorious land and forging a new path.

    一张新图　一条新路
    ——今日革命老区金寨
    近期，从北京、沈阳、南京等地回到故乡金寨县的老红军都说：金寨山青了，水清了，人的面色红润了。这变化蕴含着多么丰富的内涵啊！
    十年前的金寨牵动着多少人的关注之情。1977年，红军老战士林月琴回到故乡金寨南溪，见到一个个面黄饥瘦的乡亲，深沉地叹息道：“30年了，山区人民生活没多大变化啊！”这之后，党和国家给金寨送来救济粮款和衣物。金寨县负责同志说，国家扶持我们脱贫是要扶起我们的志气，我们不能靠“输血”过日子，要立足发展生产，坚决从经济落后的困境中解脱出来。他们利用山区资源优势，决定建立蚕桑、板栗、茶叶、畜牧、渔业、食用菌6大经济支柱，实行规模经营。同时推出一个富有胆识的大面积扶贫决策：动员100名科技人员下乡，承包10个科技项目，3年使6000户农民脱贫。
    现在，金寨已初步建成蚕桑、板栗等12个生产基地，尤其引人注目的是茧丝绸系列开发的成功，到1987年底，全县已开辟桑园7万亩，年产茧4.3万担，建成缫丝、织绸、炼染、丝织地毯等15个企业，年产值1.11亿元，创利税2000多万元。植树造林、封山育林，每年以百万亩的面积增长，数10万亩杉木林基地已经建成，嫁接成功了1千多万株板栗，全县森林覆盖率已达35％以上。经过两年科技扶贫，已有5000多户农民走出贫困的低谷，就连最偏远的山区，人民温饱问题也已基本解决。
    金寨的进步，在于精神，在于志气。10年间，金寨人民奋力前进，在这块光荣的土地上绘出了一张新图，走出了一条新路。
