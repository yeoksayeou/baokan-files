Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 12th.

	Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's urban savings deposits have reached 213 billion yuan by the end of July. Of this amount, urban savings deposits increased by 6.4 billion yuan in July alone.

	It is understood that the main reasons for the good growth momentum of savings deposits in July are the stabilization and slight decline of market prices, which have kept the public's consumption psychology relatively stable, shifting from "shopping for value preservation" to "savings for value preservation." At the same time, the bank has raised savings deposit interest rates, promoted value-preserving savings, and increased the number of term deposit categories.

    工商银行城镇储蓄
    存款超两千亿元
    新华社北京8月12日电  记者从中国工商银行总行获悉，截至7月末，工商银行城镇储蓄存款余额已达2130亿元。其中，7月份城镇储蓄存款增加64亿元。
    据了解，7月份储蓄存款增长势头好的主要原因是市场物价稳中有落，群众消费心理比较平稳，从“购物保值”转向“储蓄保值”。同时，银行通过提高储蓄存款利率，开展保值储蓄和增加定期存款档次。
