    **Symphony of Grain and Oil [Reportage]**

    **Shā Lín, Chén Shū Lè**

    What a wonderful place! Someone once exclaimed about Puyang, located in the heart of the Central Plains. This remark not only acknowledges the strategic importance of this region, where the Yellow River flows and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan converge, but also praises the present-day Puyang. In fact, the ancient Puyang, ravaged by the Yellow River's floods and wars, left few pleasant memories. The fierce local customs and the rebellions that originated here, such as the Wang Xiangzhi and the Green Forest Army, only earned it the hollow title of "Land of the Righteous." What truly transformed this once lawless land into a place of beauty and prosperity was the creative labor of the people under the socialist system and its bountiful harvests—grain and oil.

    **Looking Back at the Fields' Smiles**

    The first time Lin Zhikai, the Party Secretary of the Zhongyuan Oilfield Exploration Bureau, visited a riverside farmhouse was in April 1986, the 10th day after he took on the additional role of Mayor of Puyang City.

    The sun bathed the vast, barren, and treeless salt marshes on both sides of the Yellow River in a hazy white light. The dry north wind sang a mournful ancient song. There was a place with dozens of mud houses called Wangyao Village.

    Lin Zhikai, with his tall, one-armed figure, ducked into the crooked, windowless mud schoolhouse. Initially, it was pitch black inside, and he could only sense the faint breathing of some small creatures. After a while, he could make out the mud platform, mud stools, and about a dozen "mud children."

    In one of the mud houses with a black hole for a door, they saw an old woman curled up on a pile of straw, with a thickly encrusted bowl beside her and a dog lying next to it. Lin Zhikai stood in the darkness without speaking, but tears slowly welled up in his eyes.

    The early headquarters of the Zhongyuan Oilfield was called the "Battle Command Center," where they ate, lived, and worked in tents. The summer breeze from the Shengli Oilfield lifted the tent flaps, allowing them to see the clear sky of eastern Henan. The chief engineer, holding a pointer, looked towards the distant imaginary horizon and said, "In ancient geological times, this place was the seabed. The western uplift and the unceasing sand-carrying Yellow River caused the ancient marine life, which had been buried for millions of years, to seem eternally dormant beneath the thick soil and solid rock. Long after this seabed became land, history entered what is called the 'Heroic Age.' One of the 'Five Emperors,' Zhuanxu, on the 'New Land,' formed alliances with the western Huaxia tribes and the eastern Yi tribes, advancing the material movement in another realm. Many years passed, and the universe seemed to have forgotten the marine life that had rested in the depths of the earth. They slowly turned into oil.

    This was a moment of historical tranquility. As the tent flap fluttered in the breeze, the members of the leadership team sat shoulder to shoulder, facing the blackboard. Lin Zhikai was the youngest, known as "Number Nine." The other eight are no longer in leadership positions in the oilfield, so "Number Nine cannot leave" became a joke circulating in the oilfield. When the new system of large industrial base leadership simultaneously took on the main leadership of the local government, this "Number Nine" became the Mayor of Puyang City and later changed to the Party Secretary.

    The new leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and Government, just after Puyang was upgraded from a county to a city with a hundred industries to be developed, rented farmers' houses for offices in the municipal government and various bureaus, and faced a vast expanse of white land. The first major policy they established was to develop agriculture. They focused their investments on agriculture, and the people of Puyang proudly said, "Investing in agriculture" was a slogan they proposed a few years ahead of the rest of the country. As Lin Zhikai said at the time, "Even if we have to sell our pants, we must do it!"

    Just a few days after the new leadership was formed, they organized two investigation teams. One, led by Deputy Mayor Wang Rixin, traveled from Xinyang in the middle reaches of the Yellow River along the Yellow River dike to the estuary. The other was led by Lin Zhikai to investigate the "Three Yellow River Counties" within Puyang. The Municipal Party Committee and Government's goal of achieving a total grain production of 2.5 billion jin by 1990, with an average income of 500 yuan per person, as well as the decision to control water and promote agriculture, were all formulated based on these investigations and studies.

    Lin Zhikai stood in the old woman's house, which had only a pile of straw, a bowl, and a dog, without speaking. He wiped away the slowly trickling tears. Outside, the dilapidated walls reflected the glaring white sun. The old woman's son hung his head under Lin Zhikai's scolding. When Lin Zhikai saw a donkey and several dirty children rolling on the ground in the old woman's house, with no flour in the flour bin and no salt in the salt jar, he did not speak. He later had rice, quilts, and money sent to the old woman.

    Here, it is dry nine out of ten years, and if it is not dry, it is flooded. The people's main tasks throughout the year are to receive relief grain, prevent floods, and flee from famines, and now they also have to support the oilfield.

    Not far from here, Luanzhuang Village has a similar situation to Wangyao Village, with 80-plus bachelors out of 500 people and no new brides in four years. The shortage of bachelors and the outflow of population reduced the population from 187 at the beginning of liberation to 96 in 1986. At a cadre meeting, local new and old cadres, dressed in black cotton jackets and gray caps, appeared both anxious and slightly joyful in the smoke-filled room. They looked at the new leaders, thinking that Luanzhuang probably would not disappear from the map.

    **What is the Heart?**

    Lin Zhikai is a straightforward and uncompromising person. If a city leader is a few minutes late for an 8 a.m. meeting, he will be criticized; tasks assigned to his secretary in the morning will be asked about in the afternoon; after driving back from a meeting in Beijing, he would not go home after 12 hours of bumpy travel on a damaged road, but would rush straight to the construction site. For example, the 300,000-ton synthetic ammonia project, the ethylene project, the main road project, and other projects are his pride. Just a few days after the start of construction, he would anxiously ask why it was still like this.

    Among the oil workers, there is a straightforward personality similar to the lively and dynamic nature of military officers we often see. In the desert, flying sand, and the environment of iron, fire, and oil, this approach is more effective than eloquent speech.

    When the oilfield spirit and work style were brought to the farmers, the oil workers also carried out arduous and modern scientific labor in the vast farmland.

    Walking along the Yellow River dike, the Director of the Zhongyuan Oilfield Exploration Bureau, Jin Yuyan, would see the "Dongpu Depression" beneath the vast river area. The sea retreated from here 20 million years ago, leaving behind floating life that turned into oil, stirring the hearts of people in the 1980s. Jin Yuyan's gaze might flash with a question: Why is the oil here deeper than in other places in the country? Why do the workers, in the vast wilderness where there is no smoke, only rolling clouds and wind, have so much energy to bring oil from 3,000 meters underground?

    Jin Yuyan knew best the circumstances from which this, the fourth-largest oilfield in the country, started. When the first batch of workers arrived from the Shengli Oilfield, it was as white and clean as Wangyao Village. When the quiet Central Plains Road, the magnificent Cultural Palace, and the office buildings with arched gates appeared like a dream, oil also flowed to the world. This was oil from the "high-pressure oil and gas layer with salt," hard-won. After ten years of flying flowers turning into mud, the old workers aged even more. They sent their sons to the oilfield and their wives to the oilfield's affiliated farms, fisheries, processing plants, repair shops, and stores. These affiliated units formed the oilfield's labor service company. The general manager of the company, Zhao Shuming, was a former soldier. He led them like a soldier, nourishing the oilfield.

    The annual increase in production of the Zhongyuan Oilfield was achieved after a difficult struggle with problems such as the aging of oil wells. The oil wells were like withered breasts, but they had to produce more oil for the country. Leading here indeed required more inner strength. Fortunately, information from new exploration areas in Hubei, Anhui, Shandong, and the injection of new technologies brought dawn to the Zhongyuan Oilfield. Technology—the "King of the New Era"—made the drilling speed of the Zhongyuan Oilfield increase by 18.7% and the cost decrease by 5.3% since 1986.

    At this time, Jin Yuyan's mind was full of seismic exploration, development, logging, mud, and oil extraction, but he was still clear-headed enough to remember to think about the workers' hearts.

    What is the heart of a worker? A worker's wife and child are in a southern village, and he is separated from them for half the year, living in a board house by the Yellow River. When faced with difficulties, he would bare his chest, think of his wife and child, but could only see the sparse stars and the wind rustling the trees. One night, he dreamed that his wife appeared, wanting to speak but hesitating, then left. The next day, he was in a daze and was helped down from the derrick. At that moment, a telegram arrived with the news of his wife's death. He returned to handle the funeral and brought his five or six-year-old son with him. In the morning, the son ran out of the board house, ran to where he could see the mud-covered people swaying on the derrick, and waved to his father. The workers on the derrick could see such a small person waving to them every day in the grass.

    **The Liu-Deng Army Once Crossed the River Here**

    After the city leaders conducted a survey along the Yellow River in April, they spent seven months discussing and proposed a plan to focus on water control, with the introduction of Huanghe rice and soil improvement as the key points, for comprehensive management. This plan was in line with the farmers' thoughts, and ten thousand laborers gathered in an instant, bringing their own dry rations to the construction site without asking the government for a single cent. The tasks were distributed from the city to the suburbs, from the suburbs to the towns, from the towns to the villages, and then to each household. Thousands of households, young and old, worked together, braving the stars and the moon, starting early and returning late. At noon, they would lie down in places where the cold wind could not reach, eating dry bread and drinking cold water, telling stories of the Liangshan bandits. In two months, ten thousand laborers digging canals excavated 94 million cubic meters of soil.

    The transition from November to January of the following year took place unnoticed in the clouds. When the cold wind passed in the night, rain and snow would flutter down during the day. Lin Zhikai cautiously moved forward in the mud, as the thin ice was not strong. His one arm made it difficult for him to balance, and he swayed unsteadily, unable to pay attention to the rain and snow blowing in his face. The farmers gradually saw a row of mud-covered people approaching, and they heard the leader with one arm shout to them, soaked in the mud at the bottom of the canal: "Don't freeze!"

    Forty years ago, the two sons of the old ferryman Sun Dongwen, who ferried the Liu-Deng Army across the river, were also among the ten thousand laborers. At first, they were unwilling to go to the construction site because their village did not benefit from it. The old ferryman took his two sons to the "Liu-Deng Army Crossing the River at Sun's Mouth" monument and pointed to the rolling Yellow River, saying, "At that time, the planes bombed and the machine guns swept, but I got nothing and still ferried the army across..." The old ferryman's chest was adorned with a flowing white beard, and recalling the crossing of the river was his most glorious and solemn matter. His gaze urged his two sons to shoulder the large iron shovels and go to the construction site.

    Half a year earlier, a canal called "Pulingnan," which diverted Yellow River water to run 100 kilometers north, had already been dug. The completion of this canal actually answered the question of whether the farmers, who had been scattered after the implementation of the household responsibility system, could undertake large-scale water conservancy projects. The city leaders issued a stern order that the project must be completed during the two irrigation periods of wheat. The city leaders personally supervised the project, visiting the entire line of the construction site three times. The county magistrates, county party secretaries, and township and village cadres all lived and worked on the construction site. As a result, 490,000 cubic meters of soil were completed in 14 days, and the people themselves were astonished. "With water and canals, we can plant rice." The land's urging was silent.

    **Workers Like This Kind of Emotional Generosity**

    When the land of Puyang was no longer a vast expanse of white, it became precious. Farmers watching the loaded trucks coming in and out of the fields and the drilling towers rising from the ground began to feel heartache. Some people had been holding their breath: the oilfield has money, a segment of cable, a flange is enough for us to eat for a year. With a fierce local custom and evil born of poverty, the people suddenly "choked" the oilfield. They cut off roads, intercepted cars, and stole oil—rolling and crawling, they stole the black crude oil back to their thatched houses and refined it into gasoline using primitive methods. At that time, most of the older workers had no temper, and the workers of the Zhongyuan Oilfield Underground Operation Company could actually "drink large bowls of wine and eat large pieces of meat" with the farmers. The company and the nearby villages were harmonious, production was not disrupted, and fresh fruits and vegetables were supplied at a discount. The company's party secretary, Zhao Puhe, said that this situation was achieved with sincerity.

    Who among them was not from a village, understanding the hardship of guarding a piece of thin land. They sincerely participated in poverty alleviation, taking out cars, machines, electricity, and oil from their own profits, along with technology, to give to the farmers. Chinese farmers, behind their cunning, are pure and simple. Even if they only get a share, they will repay sincerity with sincerity. They educated each other, made agreements, and protected the oilfield's facilities and production. They also erected a large stone tablet in a lush courtyard of the Underground Operation Company to thank the selfless assistance from underground.

    Zhao Puhe did not actively seek out leaders for personal matters when he had no official business. This seems not to be a "way of being an official" in today's world. He said he had no desire for life and official positions, only wanting to do a good job and be worthy of the party's education.

    In the spring and summer, Zhao Puhe, along with the "project general manager," "geology general manager," and about forty engineers and twenty office staff, went to the repair well brigade under the company to implement the "three-in-one." The term "three-in-one" was unfamiliar to outsiders for nearly ten years, coinciding with the "513" battle of the Zhongyuan Oilfield, where some office staff worked with oil stains on their bodies at the wellhead, finished their work, and lined up to buy food.

    "The fatigue tactic of fighting every day is not feasible, but in special situations, how can we do without a battle!" said Zhang Jianke, the office director of the Underground Operation Company, in response to some views on the battle in society. The Zhongyuan Oilfield is at the end of the North China Power Grid, with poor and unreliable power quality.

    In March, a heavy snowstorm covered the sky, and dozens of power lines went out, stopping all the derricks. When the power lines were repaired, the geological conditions several kilometers deep underground had already changed like clouds. It took more than a month to return to normal, and production was greatly reduced. Thus, there was a "513" battle, meaning 500 oil wells, 100 water wells, and an increase of 3,000 tons of production per day.

    Liu Daishen, the manager of the Underground Operation Company, was a former team leader, known for his hard work. Some people said that it was not simple for him to be in a leading position in the oilfield without roots. The fact is that in addition to hard work, there is also some luck. During one battle, the first and second leaders were not present, and he, who had been a deputy for many years, took temporary command. Every night, he reported to the leaders simply and clearly. From then on, he won the trust of his comrades with his own style. He usually did not command work in the office but called the heads of various departments to the site and made decisions on the spot. Once, the power line was changed, originally estimated to take six or seven days, but he supervised the site, and it was completed in one day. He worked like this, and in one month, he could do the work of half a year. When he took office, half the time had passed, but only one-tenth of the task was completed. After leading the work for a while, the efficiency soared, and the annual task was completed a month ahead of schedule. Such a person as the first leader, who would not be liked by everyone from top to bottom?

    Liu Daishen cared for the workers. In the summer, he had the office staff send the electric fans from the office to the frontline workers' board houses. He was the first to place his own electric fan in the most conspicuous place in the hallway, without saying a word.

    For nearly one-third of the year, they spent their evenings like this: Zhao Puhe, with a little oil stain on his body, returned from the wellhead with the workers, walked into the somewhat glorious new canteen in the setting sun, surrounded by excited young workers. Zhao Puhe vividly described how, twenty years ago, they used a 100-horsepower "East is Red" to lower the casing into the oil well, using their feet and hands to pull the operating lever, and the machine made a creaking sound. The young workers now use a 150-horsepower imported car and cannot imagine the past difficulties. At this time, twilight enveloped another field, and Liu Daishen might be casually wearing an oil-stained work uniform, holding hot steamed buns bought from the locals, running through the path, and entering the workshop. Each person gets two, of course, with a little wine. Northern workers particularly like this kind of generous and somewhat carefree boldness.

    **The Yellow River Cannot Be Rich with Only One Method**

    When the clouds thickened, the officials standing by the office window had a look of joy. The first few drops of rain that fell on the documents at the end of autumn made Lin Zhikai think it was from the teacup. When the rain was about to stop, he called a few officials and drove straight to the fields of Yue Village. From afar, they could see the floating rain mist, and up close, they saw the land that had turned from dry yellow to soft. Lin Zhikai squatted down and used his left hand to deeply insert it into the soil, digging out a handful to check the moisture. If there was no powdery soil flying out, then wheat could be sown.

    The sowing meeting was held the next day, with military orders, mobilizing the entire city, no different from the oil workers.

    In fact, wheat was no longer the decisive crop here. Due to Lin Zhikai's mobilization of ten thousand soldiers to manage the Yellow River beach, dig ditches to drain water, and build sluices to prevent drought, the barren land of a thousand years today has more than ten million mu of rice sprouting in the vast area just across the Yellow River dike. Fish farming, lotus planting, reed planting, and watermelon planting. Planting five trees per person in the low-lying areas and river beaches is a mandatory indicator.

    Lin Zhikai strongly advocated planting watermelons in the Yellow River beach area, which is a manifestation of the harmony of nature: the Yellow River usually floods a few days after the watermelon harvest. During the harvest season, the city was filled with watermelons everywhere. Lin Zhikai placed a pile of samples in his office, and when guests from other places came, he first promoted the watermelons to them before discussing work. Those days, when the price of watermelons in other cities was rising sharply, the oil workers, looking at the piles of cheap watermelons at home, were a bit confused.

    The team working on poverty alleviation doubted the folk song that has been passed down for a thousand years, "The Yellow River is a thousand miles long, but it is only rich with one method." They did not believe that the mother of the nation only favored one place. Their slogan was to be sincere, to be energetic, and to do practical things for poverty alleviation. Thousands of cadres made military pledges to the city leadership, each person taking responsibility for one county or village, living and eating in the countryside. When the poverty is alleviated, they will return to the office, and their salaries will be increased by one level. Those who perform poorly will be immediately recalled for handling. Some cadres who used to drink tea and read newspapers now go to the fields first thing in the morning to check on the crops. When the sun dispersed the morning fog, they would return to throw the first handful of firewood into the stove.

    As long as people's sincerity can shine in an instant

    Zhang Jianke and the party office director, Han Wanjie, spoke of the underground technology beautifully, like poetry. They said that people call them "oilfield doctors." They said that when a well reaches old age and the oil stops flowing, a machine is used to create countless cracks in the rock several kilometers deep, filling it with sand to allow the oil, originally blocked by the rock, to seep out through the cracks. This is called "fracturing." This is the latest technology internationally, and the workers of the Underground Operation Company used two groups of American fracturing vehicles to perform this great fusion of man and nature in an attractive manner. The roar and grandeur of the scene made people feel in an instant that it was a great ceremony of ancient humans, with dozens of vehicles of various colors surrounding a derrick, sending human power to the depths of several kilometers of lava. The oil workers spend their lives in such scenes and the vast desert grasslands, exposing the natural essence.

    The expansion of "fracturing" increased the original oil production of the Zhongyuan Oilfield by tens of millions of tons, earning a net profit of over 13 million yuan. The company that made the Zhongyuan Oilfield's fracturing technology the best in the world was also the Underground Company.

    Zhao Puhe, Zhang Jianke, and Han Wanjie were doing people's work. They did not stay in the time tunnel but advocated "three olds and four stricts," "two participations and one reform and three combinations." They said that after trying various methods, they picked up these slogans from the dust. They said that people's desires cannot be endlessly stimulated, and spiritual factors such as loyalty and love are indispensable for doing great things. Igniting these spiritual sparks in people's hearts has a simple but difficult-to-implement trick.

    "Eliminate those evil and corrupt things!" Unfortunately, the trick cannot be summoned, said the underground leaders. Just after finishing a recruitment exam, although it was only for a few dozen contract workers, thousands of workers were watching. Before the exam, we stipulated that if cheating was found, half a year's bonus and half a level of salary would be deducted. If we don't do it seriously, the masses will be so angry that they will lose all initiative.

    This recruitment was indeed a dangerous experience! One morning, the principal who set the questions, along with two teachers, quietly ran to Liaocheng, Shandong. They were not allowed to write letters or make phone calls, eating and living together, and supervising each other. When the day of the exam arrived at six in the morning, the three returned with the questions they had prepared. The exam room had dozens of invigilators, and one teacher supervised a few examinees. The answer sheets were judged by more than twenty teachers in a relay. Even with such strictness, there was still cheating. A 15-year-old girl cut her hair short and applied something to her face, disguising herself as her brother. The teacher noticed the strange looks from other children and went to inspect. A female voice revealed the trick, and she was taken away nonchalantly, truly beyond imagination!

    It is difficult to eradicate ugly things. The parents of the dozens of examinees standing in the cold wind outside the exam room understood this logic, but hearing the disappointed curses of those who had originally been full of confidence in walking through the back door, their tense faces showed a joyful flush.

    At this time, the underground people were all praying in their hearts, hoping that all sincerity would not slowly fade away in hypocrisy and filth, and that there would be magnificent sacrifices and sacrifices, as long as everyone's sincerity could shine in an instant.

    **Do Not Cry in the Sound of Firecrackers**

    Lin Zhikai returned to the crooked mud house in Wangyao Village. The old woman was no longer there. She did not see the village's rice mountains, every family building new houses, and 25 of the 70-plus bachelors getting married, and was carried away from the straw pile to the ground. Before she died, she kissed the land through a few withered grasses.

    Lin Zhikai slowly shed tears again. He had come here six times, from persuading rice planting, seed selection, to irrigation, and harvesting, taking care of everything. Now his tearful eyes returned from the old woman's house, which was about to disappear, and heard the joyous shouts and firecrackers from the other side, whether it was a wedding or a roof-raising ceremony.

    The entire Puyang, with five counties and one district, also had a small miracle in agriculture. In the context of national agriculture stagnating, Puyang started in 1986 and took three big steps in three years, increasing production by more than 100 million jin each year.

    On the eve of the lunar New Year in 1988, 20-plus cadres and villagers from eight villages carried two large wooden plaques inscribed with "Correct the Source and Clear the Stream" and "Enrich the Homeland" to Lin Zhikai's home; a few days later, several old farmers carried rice and walked more than 100 miles to find Secretary Lin to taste the new rice; the bachelors in Wangyao Village who were about to get married specially drove 60-plus miles to invite Lin Zhikai to the village to take a commemorative photo.

    This place is truly wonderful

    The demon-like fire broke out like this: the Zhongyuan Oilfield Well 146 suddenly had a super-strong well blowout, with a strong natural gas carrying the crude oil straight up 40-50 meters high. Oil and gas rained down, and everything within a radius of ten miles, including houses, crops, roads, and pedestrians, was blackened. The spark from the car engine ignited the well blowout, turning it into a sky-high flame in an instant. It was a fire with white light mixed with black threads. The 40-meter-high derrick collapsed into molten steel in just five minutes. At night, the fire scene was as bright as day, illuminating the busy crowd with scorching heat and anxiety. The original oilfield party secretary, now the deputy governor of Henan Province, Hu Xiaoyun, Mayor Lin Zhikai, and Deputy Director of the Oilfield Li Yunzi quickly formed a rescue leadership team. Tens of thousands of farmers, holding the oilfield's fried flatbread, evacuated the danger zone. Five foreign oil companies called to say: If China cannot control the well blowout, our company is willing to help... The rescue commander Li Yunzi immediately rejected the offer.

    The high-pressure water jet cutter gun sent by the Sichuan Oilfield to support the effort was unable to cut off the wellhead that caused the flames to run wild. The chief engineer of the Underground Operation Company, Liang Junqi, developed a dual-tube quad-nozzle cutter gun overnight. This gun, with 370 atmospheres of pressure, carried water and quartz sand with a force stronger than a bullet to cut through a 30-millimeter-thick steel plate like reeds. The fire rushed into the sky, and people could approach it.

    The nearby farmers voluntarily requested to stop irrigating and let the water go to the fire. Lin Zhikai gave the order to cut off the main canal and divert the water to the fire scene.

    Nearly a thousand rescue team members, each receiving a roasted chicken and a set of work clothes per day, surrounded the flames in oil and water up to their knees. Their eyes and faces were all swollen from the heat. The roar of the well blowout and the flames was like thunder, and nothing could be heard within a few miles. People wore earplugs to prevent their eardrums from bursting, and two people facing each other had to write on a blackboard to communicate. Just as they were in difficulty, a flange next to the fire scene exploded, and a flash of white light lasted for a second, and people fell down, with their noses and ears burned away.

    The fire, just because of a flash of wind, engulfed a few people, and a firefighter's photographer was instantly unrecognizable. Another photographer next to him saved his life, and later his rescue team's photo won the national gold award.

    The time for the impact had come. The assault team was voluntarily formed by unmarried young men, wearing helmets and fire suits, standing in batches, with no one speaking, their faces with a seriousness they had never had before. They knew that advancing was a matter of life and death. Six or seven fire trucks were lined up, with one facing each assault team member. The high-pressure water hose was helpless against the fire and could only be used to protect the people, forming a large water circle around the people, pushing them into the fire scene. People entered the fire to tighten screws and remove parts, surrounded by white light, with no oxygen, having a strange and painful experience. After entering the flames for one or two minutes, the fire suit slowly dissolved, and people staggered out, completely blackened, with the second batch following, and then the third and fourth batches. The oilfield leaders held the hands of the assault team members and could not speak, tears streaming down. At this moment, everyone forgot about the material world and only knew that there was fire.

    The fire was extinguished on the 26th day, and the well blowout was silenced. More than a thousand people, black and exhausted, gathered together and threw their safety helmets into the air. The sound of sobs and cheers thundered. The people of Zhongyuan will forever remember this day: November 26, 1986. That year, the grain harvest in Puyang was particularly good, and some people said it was the result of black oil and blood.

    In the twilight of clouds and rainbows, a person, amidst the rising smoke, looked at the sky and the earth and sighed, "What a wonderful place! It has two treasures: grain and oil!"

    I forgot who he was.

    粮油交响曲〔报告文学〕
    沙林　陈书乐
    真好，这块地方！有人这样赞叹地处中原的濮阳。这话里除了承认古兵家必争的这块大河之腰、冀鲁豫三省牵手处的重要性之外，更多是赞美濮阳的今天。其实，黄河肆虐，兵燹连绵，使古代的濮阳没给人太多美好记忆；这里剽悍的民风以及从这里拔刃而起的瓦岗军、王仙芝和绿林军，也仅给它一个“义士故乡”的虚名。真能使昔日绿林聚啸之地变得风灵神秀的还是社会主义制度下人民的创造性的劳动及其丰硕成果——粮食和石油。
    回眸田野中的憨笑
    中原油田勘探局党委书记林治开第一次到河之侧的农屋是1986年4月他兼任濮阳市市长的第10天。
    太阳把黄河堤里堤外广大无草无木的盐碱地照成白色的朦胧，北方刮来的旱风唱着凄凉的古歌，河之侧有块竖着几十间泥屋的地方叫王窑村。
    林治开弯下高大的独臂之躯钻进村小学那歪歪扭扭的没有窗户的泥屋子，乍一进一片黑暗，只觉有些弱小生灵在喘息，过一会才分辨出泥台子、泥凳子和十几个“泥孩子”。
    在一间敞着黑洞的泥屋里，他们看到一位老太太蜷在一堆草上，旁边有只结了厚垢的大碗，卧着一只狗。林治开站在黑暗中没说话，眼泪却慢慢渗出。
    中原油田初期的首脑机关叫“会战指挥部”，吃、住、干都在帐篷里，从胜利油田那边吹来的夏风掀起门帘，使人能看到豫东清澄的天空。总工程师手执教鞭望着远处想象中的海平线说：我们这里在古地质年代是海底，西部造山运动和黄河不息的携沙而来使经亿万年沉积的古海洋生物似乎永恒地沉息在厚土坚岩下。当这片海底成为陆地后很久，历史才进入所谓“英雄时代”，“五帝”之一的颛顼在“新陆地”上结交西方华夏部族与东方东夷部族，演进着物质运动的另一个范畴。很多年过去了，宇宙似乎忘记了歇息在地层深处的海洋生命，它们慢慢变成石油。
    这是历史宁静的片刻，领导班子的几位成员在微风掀动帐篷一角的时候都面朝黑板并肩而坐。林治开的年龄最小，被称为“老九”。其他8位目前已不在油田领导岗位，“老九不能走”因而成了一句戏语在油田流传开来。当实行大型工业基地的领导同时兼任当地政府的主要领导的新体制时，这“老九”便又当上了濮阳市市长，后改任书记。
    市委市政府的新领导在濮阳由县立为市不久的百业待举的时候，在市政府及各局委都租用农民房办公的时候，在新班子面对着白茫茫大地的时候，立的第一条大政方针就是发展农业。他们把投资重点放到农业上，濮阳人总骄傲地说，“农业要投入”是他们早于全国几年提出的，用当时林治开的话说，没钱卖了裤子也得干！
      新班子组成没几天，就组织了两个调查组，一个由副市长王日新带队，从位于黄河中游的新乡沿黄河大堤一直走到入海口，一个就是林治开带队，调查濮阳境内的“沿黄三县”。市委、市政府提出的到1990年全市粮食总产达25亿斤，人均收入500元的奋斗目标，以及治水兴农的决策，就是在这些调查研究的基础上制订的。
      林治开站在老太婆那间只有一堆草、一只碗和一只狗的黑屋里没说话，抹去慢慢沁出的眼泪。屋外，断壁危房映着刺目的白太阳，老太婆的儿子在林治开的骂声中耷拉着脑袋。当林治开到他的黑屋里看到一只驴和几个脏孩子在满地滚，面缸里没面，盐罐里没盐，就没有说话。回去后叫人把大米、棉被和钱给老太婆送去。
      这里十年九旱，不旱即涝。老百姓整年要干的事就是领救济粮、防汛和逃荒，现在还加了支援油田。
      离这不远的栾庄村与王窑村那种500口人中80多条光棍、4年没娶过一个新媳妇的穷困状况差不多。光棍绝户和人口外逃使解放初期的187口人减至1986年的96口人。在干部会上，穿着黑棉袄和灰的卡的本地新老干部在烟雾腾腾中呈现着既焦灼又略带欢欣的神色，他们望着新领导想，栾庄大概不会在地图上消失了。
          心是什么
      林治开是干脆利落、不讲情面的人，8点钟开会，你市领导晚来几分钟也得挨批评；他上午布置给秘书的任务，下午就问结果；他驱车从北京开会回来，在破损的公路上颠簸12个小时，每每不回家，而是直奔工地。比如30万吨合成氨工程，乙烯工程，主干道工程等，这些工程是他的骄子，动工才几天，他就着急地问怎么还这样子。
      石油人中有种粗线条的性格，与我们习见的部队军官那种夏日雷雨般生动的性格很相象。在戈壁荒滩、飞砂走石、铁、火、油交汇的环境里，这种作派比娓娓而谈更管用。
    在油田人把油田精神、油田作风带到农民中去的时候，油田人也以自己的传统精神在广袤的农田下进行着艰巨同时又是饱含现代科技的劳动。
    同在黄河大堤上走，中原油田勘探局局长金毓荪会看到广大河区底下的“东濮凹陷”，海从这里退下了两千万年，遗下的浮游生命变成了石油，引动20世纪80年代人的心弦。金毓荪的眼神或许闪着询问，为什么这里的油深于全国其他地方？为什么工人们在举目不见炊烟，只有滚云和风的原野上，能有那么大的劲头把油从地底3000米处取上来？
    这个全国第四大油田是从什么境地起步的，金毓荪最清楚，胜利油田吹来的风送来第一批工人时，这里同王窑村的农民看到的一样，是白茫茫一片真干净。当宁静的中原大道、富丽堂皇的文化宫以及有拱形大门的办公大楼梦幻般出现时，油也流向了世界。那是从“有盐高压油气层”取上的油，来之不易。10年飞花都成了泥，老工人更老了，他们把自己的儿子又送给了油田，还把妻子送给了油田附属下的农场、渔场、加工厂、修理厂、商店。这些附属单位组成了油田的劳动服务公司。公司的总经理赵树桐曾是军人，他像军人一样受命领导他们，滋养着油田。
    中原油田产量每年的增长是与油井老化等难题进行了艰难搏斗后取得的。油井越来越像干瘪的乳房，却须为国家拿出更多的油，在这里担当领导，确实得有更多的内在毅力。值得欣慰的是湖北、安徽、山东等新勘探区的信息，以及新技术的注入，给中原油田带来曙色。技术——“新时代之王”，使1986年以来中原油田钻井速度每年增长18.7％，成本下降5.3％。
    这时，金毓荪满脑子地震勘探、开发、测井、泥浆、采油，但他还是清醒地知道，要时时想到工人的心。
    工人的心是什么呢？一个工人的妻和子在南方农村，他每年有半年的分离，住在黄河边的板房内，碰到困难就光着膀子上，想妻和子啦，却只能看星稀月明、风响树摇。一夜他梦见妻飘然而至，欲言又止，转而即去。第二天他神情恍惚，被人搀下井架。这时电报来了，是妻的噩讯。他回去办理丧事后把五、六岁的儿子带了来。早晨，儿子从板房里跑出来，跑到能看到泥糊糊的人在井架上晃动的地方向父亲挥手。井架上的工人都能看到，那么小的一个人，每天在草丛中向他们挥手。
      刘邓大军曾从这里渡河
    市领导在4月沿黄调查之后，论证研究了7个月，提出了以治水为中心，以引黄种稻、改土为重点，进行综合治理的方案。这与农民的想法一拍即合，十万民工呼一下聚了起来，不要政府一分钱，自带干粮上工地。任务由市分到郊县、分到乡、分到村，再由各家各户包了起来。千家万户的男女老少一起上，披星戴月、早出晚归，中午则躺在寒风不到的角落，啃干馍、喝凉水，说着梁山遗事。两个月内，十万开渠民工挖出940万方土。
      11月到第二年1月的转换是在阴云中不知不觉进行的，当寒风在夜中过去，雨雪会在白天翩然而至。林治开在泥泞中试探着前进，因为薄冰并不坚硬，独臂使他平衡困难，他摇摇摆摆已无力顾及扑面的雨雪。农民逐渐看清了正在走近的一行浑身泥浆的人，他们听到为首的独臂人向渠底泡在泥水中的他们喊道：别冻着了！
    40年前为刘邓大军摆渡的老水手孙东稳的两个儿子也在十万民工中。开始他们因本村不得益不愿上工地，老水手把两个儿子带到“刘邓大军孙口渡河处”之碑前，指着翻滚的黄河说，当年飞机轰炸、机枪扫射，我什么也得不到，不照样为大军摆渡去了吗……老水手胸前飘逸着白胡子，渡江忆旧是他最光彩也最严肃的事。他的目光催促着两个儿子扛着大铁铲上工地去了。
    半年前，有一条把黄河水夺来向北运送100公里的“濮清南”大渠就已挖通了。这条渠的挖成实际回答了实行家庭责任制后千家万户分散的农民能否搞大型水利工程的问题。市领导下了死命令，工程一定要在小麦两个浇水期中间完成，市领导亲自督阵，三次亲临全线工地，各县县长、县委书记和乡、村干部都吃住在工地，结果49万方土方在14天内完成，众人自己也被惊得目瞪口呆。“有水和渠，可以种水稻了。”土地的催促是无言的。
    工人喜欢这种充满感情的豪爽
    当濮阳地界不再白茫茫一片时，土地就珍贵起来。农民看着载重车在田里出出进进、钻塔拔地而起就心疼起来。一些人原来就憋着气：油田有钱，一段缆线，一个法兰就够我们吃一年。民风剽悍、恶从穷生，呼啦啦，百姓们一下子“扼”上了油田。断路、截车、偷油——连滚带爬把黑糊糊的原油偷回茅屋里土法上马竟也熬出了汽油。那时，大多数工人老大哥都没脾气，中原油田井下作业公司的人竟能和农民“大碗喝酒，大块吃肉”。公司和附近村庄欢洽融融，生产不受干扰不说，鲜果菜蔬还能得到优惠供应。公司党委书记赵丕和说，这局面是用心换来的。
    他们谁不是农村来的，清楚农民守着一片薄地的艰辛。他们真诚地投入扶贫实践，从自己的利润提成中拿出汽车、机器、电、油，同技术一起献给农民。中国农民，狡猾后面就是纯朴，虽仅分得一羹，也以诚相报，他们互相教育，制定公约，保护油田的设施和生产。他们还在井下公司一处林木茂盛的院落立一大石碑，感谢井下的无私援助。
    赵丕和无公务时从不主动找领导攀谈，这在当今似乎不是一种“为官之道”，他自言对生活和官职没有什么欲望了，只求好好干，对得起党的教育。
    春夏之交，赵丕和带着“工程老总”、“地质老总”等三四十个总工程师和二十几个机关干部到公司属下的修井大队实行“三同”。“三同”一词外来者耳生了近十年，恰逢中原油田“513”大会战，颇见一些机关干部油污一身地到井位劳动，完了活端着饭盒排队买饭吃。
    “疲劳战术，天天会战自不可取，特殊情况下会战怎么能少！”井下作业公司办公室主任张建科针对社会上对会战的一些看法这样说。中原油田处在华北电网的末端，供电质量差且无保障。
  3月份扑天盖地一场大雪，几十条电路停了电，一个个井架都停了钻，电路修好时，地底几千米深的地质情况早已飘云般地变化了。恢复了一个多月才正常，产量大减，于是有个“513”大会战，意思是500口油井，100口水井，一天要增产3000吨。
    井下作业公司经理刘代臣是作业队长出身，苦干出来的，一些人说他在油田没根没底能当正职不简单。事实说明除苦干外还是要有些机缘。一次会战，一二把手都不在，他当了多年副职，任临时指挥，每晚向领导汇报，简单明了，口齿清晰。从此他以他自己的风格赢得了同志们对他的信任。他一般不在办公室指挥工作，而是把各部门负责人叫到现场，当场拍板。有一次电线线路更改，原预计得六七天，他盯在工地上，一天就干完了。他这样干，一个月几乎能顶平常半年的工作量。他上任初，时间过半任务只完成十分之一，他领着干了一段后，效率飞长，结果提前一月完成全年任务。这样的人当第一把手，上上下下谁不喜欢？
    刘代臣对工人有感情，夏天他让机关干部把办公室的电扇都送到前线工人的板房里，他第一个把自己屋里的电扇往走廊最显眼的地方一放，在旁边立着什么话都不说。
    一年有近三分之一的黄昏，他们是这样度过的：赵丕和身上沾了些许油污与工人一起从井位回来，走进夕阳下有些辉煌的新食堂，旁边围着显得有些兴奋的青工。赵丕和绘声绘色地讲20年前用100马力的“东方红”往油井里下套管，得脚手并用拉操纵杆，机器还嘎嘎直叫。青工们现在用150马力的进口车，想象不到过去的艰难。这时，暮霭笼罩了另一块田野，刘代臣可能正随便披着油污的工作服，捧着从老百姓那买来的热烧饼小跑着穿过小径，钻进工棚，每人两个，当然还少不了沽点洒。北方工人对于带点落拓兴味的豪爽是格外喜欢的。
    黄河千里不能唯富一套
    当阴云浓厚起来时，守在办公室窗口的干部们有了喜色。秋末之雨随风斜飘到文件上的最初几滴，林治开以为是茶杯里掉的。他在雨将停未停时，叫上几个干部驱车直奔岳村的地里。远处才能看到飘动的雨烟，近处是由干黄变得柔润的土地。林治开蹲下来用左手深深插进泥土里，挖出一把看墒情。如果没有干粉样的土飘出，那就可以播种麦子了。
    播种会议是第二天召开的，军令如山，全市动员，与石油人无异。
    其实小麦在这里已不是决定性的农作物了。由于林治开动员十万大军治理黄河滩，开沟排涝，筑闸防旱，千年的不毛之地今日已有十几万亩水稻呼啦啦在与黄河一堤之隔的广大地区冒了出来。养鱼、种藕、植苇、种西瓜。洼地河滩每人植活五棵树是硬性指标。
    黄河滩区种西瓜是林治开大力提倡的，这是大自然和谐的一种体现：黄水通常在西瓜抢收后的几天漫上来。收获季节，市里漫天遍野都是西瓜，林治开放了一堆样品在办公室，异地客人来了，先向其推销西瓜再谈工作。那些日子，当别的城市西瓜价格直线上升时，石油工人望着家里堆积成山的便宜西瓜有些迷朦。
    搞扶贫的一班人对流传千年的“黄河千里，唯富一套”的民谣很怀疑，他们不相信民族之母只钟情一地。他们的口号是动真情，鼓真劲，为脱贫办实事。几千干部向市领导机关立了军令状，1人包1乡或1村，吃住全在乡村里，什么时候脱贫了，什么时候回机关，回来后工资向上浮动一级。表现不好的马上撤回处理。有些过去喝茶看报的干部现在早上第一件事是跑到地里看庄稼。太阳驱散晨雾时，他们才回去往炉灶里塞第一把柴禾。
    只要人的真情能在瞬间光耀
    张建科和党办主任韩万吉把井下工艺说得优美如诗，他们说，人称他们为“油田大夫”。他们说，当一个井到了暮年，油快不流了，用一种机器把几千米深的那处岩石弄出无数缝隙，把砂子填进去，让本来被岩石挡住的油顺着缝隙渗出，这叫做“压裂”。这在国际上是一种最新技术，井下作业公司的工人使用两种美国的压裂车群把这种人与自然的伟大溶合表演得引人入胜。那种轰鸣和浩荡的场面，使人瞬间觉得是远古人类的一种伟大仪式，几十台各色各样的车围着一个井架，把人类的力量送到几千米之下的溶岩的故乡。石油工人一生就是在这种场面和裸露自然本色的大漠草原中渡过的。
    “压裂”的展开使中原油田原油增产几十万吨，获纯利1300多万元。而使中原油田压裂技术的研究居第一流的也是井下公司。
    赵丕和、张建科、韩万吉他们是做人的工作的，他们并没凝在时间的隧道里，却提“三老四严”、“两参一改三结合”。他们说是试了各种办法后，重新把这些口号从灰尘中拾了起来。他们说人的欲望是不能无穷地挑逗，忠诚、热爱等精神因素是干大事必不可少的。燃起人们内心这些精神火花，有一个简单却又很难实行的绝招。
      “清除那些邪恶和腐败吧！”可惜绝招是呼唤不来的，井下领导干部说。刚搞完一次招工考试，别看仅是几十名合同工，几千名职工都盯着呢。考前我们规定，如发现作弊扣除半年奖金、降半级工资。不动真格不行了，群众对为政不廉恨得发疯，一个走了后门，几百个骂大街，积极性根本无法提高。
    这次招工真是一场险恶的经历！一天清晨，出题的校长带着两个老师悄没声息地跑到山东聊城。他们不准写信、打电话，吃住在一起，互相监督。等考试的当天清晨六点，三位带着出好的题回来了。考场一间屋子有十几个监考的，一个老师就监视几个考生。考卷是由20多个老师流水判，一人判一题。如此之严还是有人作弊，一个15岁女孩子把头发剪短，脸上涂了些什么，扮成她哥哥的模样。老师看到别的孩子投去的目光有些蹊跷，就过去审视，一出女声便露了馅，她满不在乎地被带下去，真是匪夷所思！
    丑恶之事的灭迹是很难的，在考场外的寒风中翘首伫立的几十位考生父母是明白这个理的，但听到原来充满自信的走后门者的失望的低声咒骂，他们绷紧的脸有了喜悦的血色。
    这时候，井下人都在心底祈祷，但愿一切真情不要在虚伪、龌龊中慢慢消退，宁愿有壮丽的付出与牺牲，只要每个人的真情能在瞬间光耀起来。
    不要在鞭炮声中流泪
    林治开又来到王窑村那间歪歪扭扭的泥屋，老太婆已不在了。她没看到村里稻米成山，家家举梁盖房，70多条光棍有25个将成婚，就被人从稻草堆上抬到土里。临死前，她隔着几根枯草亲吻着土地。
    林治开又慢慢流出泪水。他六次来这里，从劝说种稻、选种到排灌、收割，事事过问。现在他的泪眼从即将不存在的老太婆那飘动衰草的泥屋收了回来，听到了那边不知是接亲还是上梁的欢呼声和鞭炮声。
    整个濮阳五县一区在农业上也有个小小的奇迹，在全国农业徘徊停滞的情况下，濮阳从1986年起三年迈了三大步，每年增产一亿多斤。
    1988年阴历大年三十，八村干群20多人抬着镌刻“正本清源”和“富我乡里”的两块枣木大匾来到林治开家；过了几天又有几个老农扛着大米步行100多里来找林书记，要请林书记尝尝新米；王窑村即将成婚的光棍汉们专门驱车60多公里请林治开到村上同他们照相留念。
    这块地方真好
    那场恶魔般的大火是这样爆发的：中原油田卫146井突然发生特强井喷，强大的天然气挟持原油直冲四五十米高，油气如雨，方圆十数里内的房舍、庄稼、公路、行人全被染黑了。汽车发动机火星使井喷立时成为冲天烈焰。那全是白亮中藏着黑丝的火，40多米高的井架5分钟就被烧塌成钢水了。入夜，火场远近亮如白昼，把奔忙的人群照得灼热而焦急。原油田党委书记现任河南省副省长的胡笑云、市长林治开、油田副局长李允子等迅速组成抢险领导小组。几万农民捧着油田发的煎饼大馍撤离险区。五家外国石油公司来电说：中国若无能力制服井喷，本公司愿意效劳……抢险总指挥李允子一口回绝。
    四川油田支援来的单管高压水力切割枪无力割掉使烈焰四处狂奔的封井器，井下作业公司的主任工程师梁军歧连夜研制出双管四喷嘴切割枪。这枪里的370个大气压携着水和石英砂以比子弹还厉害的劲力把30毫米厚的钢板像苇一样割断。火向空中奔去，人稍可接近。
    附近农民主动要求停止浇地，把水让与救火。林治开一声令下，断掉大渠，把水引向火场。
    近千名抢险队员每人每天一只烧鸡一身工作服，在没膝深的油水中围住烈焰，眼睛和脸全烤肿了。井喷和烈焰轰响如雷，数里之内什么也听不到，人们带着耳塞以防耳膜震破，两人面对面站着也得在黑板上写字代言。正在艰难之际，火场旁一个法兰又爆了，白光闪过一秒，人就扑啦啦往下掉，鼻子耳朵都烧没了。
    大火仅因风的一闪就把几个人卷了进去，消防队一个摄影手瞬间就尸骨难辨。另一个在旁的摄影手保全了性命，后来他的抢险组照获得全国金奖。
    冲击的时候到了，突击队由没结过婚的小伙子自愿组成，穿戴着钢盔和消防衣分批站立，没有一人说话，脸上是从未有过的严肃，他们知道前进是生死难料。六七辆消防车并着排，一辆对着一个突击队员。高压水龙对火已无奈只能浇人护人，使人形成一个大水圈，推着人往火场里冲。人进到火里拧螺丝、卸器件，周身被白光笼罩，没有氧气，有一种奇异而痛苦的体验。进到烈焰
  中一二分钟防火衣就慢慢消溶，人只有满身焦黑地踉跄退出，第二批接着再上，还有第三批、第四批。油田领导握住突击队员的手说不出话，泪如雨下。大家这时都忘了物质世界的其他而只知道有火。
    火在第26天熄灭，井喷也消声匿迹。黑糊糊的上千人乏力地涌到一起把安全帽扔向天空，呜咽声和欢呼声雷动。中原人永远记住了这一天：1986年11月26日。这一年濮阳粮食收成格外好，有人说这是黑油和血渗的。
    云蒸霞蔚的黄昏，有一个人在香烟袅袅中没说话，看看天空和大地感叹道，真好，这块地方！有这么两件宝：粮食和石油！
    忘了他是谁了。
