	Beijing Soft Drink Market Sampling Results:
	Half of Sodas Fail Quality Standards

	Beijing, August 16 (Xinhua) — Reporter Liu Guilian reports: How is the quality of sodas on the Beijing soft drink market this summer? At the request of the Ministry of Light Industry, the National Food Quality Supervision and Inspection Center conducted a sampling inspection. The results show that out of 85 samples tested, only 44.7% met quality standards. The rest of the products had issues such as insufficient carbon dioxide content, and some had bacterial counts that far exceeded the standards. Additionally, the packaging labels of most products did not meet the requirements.

	Starting in June, the inspection center, acting as consumers, randomly sampled products from the Beijing market. The inspection items included sensory indicators, chemical indicators, and microbial indicators. Experts found that products from large factories with high levels of mechanization and management had better indicators overall. However, many small factories that have emerged in recent years generally had poorer quality. The hygiene standards require that the total bacterial count per milliliter should not exceed 100. However, the Beijing Jingzi An Ding Beverage Factory's sweet orange soda and the Ningxia Qingtongxia City Beverage Factory's health cola had bacterial counts that exceeded the standards by 350 times and 22 times, respectively. Particularly, the Beijing Shunyi Jinhu brand Seven-Star Cola and Binglian soda had coliform bacteria counts that exceeded the national hygiene standards.

	The Ministry of Light Industry requires that products with unqualified safety indicators in this sampling inspection must immediately stop production and rectify the issues, and the products must stop being sold. For products with insufficient carbon dioxide, the factories should gradually update their equipment and improve their operating procedures to meet the national standards as soon as possible.

    北京冷饮市场抽测结果
    汽水半数不合格
    本报北京8月16日讯　记者刘桂莲报道：今年夏季，北京冷饮市场上汽水质量如何？受轻工部委托，国家食品质量监督检验测试中心作了抽查，结果表明：85种抽查样品质量合格的只有44.7％，其余产品有的二氧化碳气含量不足，有的细菌数严重超标，此外，绝大多数产品包装标签不符合要求。
    从6月份开始，检测中心就以消费者的身份，从北京地区市场上随机抽样，检测项目包括感官指标、理化指标、微生物指标等。专家们发现，那些机械化程度和管理水平高的大厂的产品，各项指标都比较好。而近些年新发展起来的小厂则一般质量较差。卫生指标规定，细菌总数每毫升不得大于100个。可是北京警字安定饮料厂的甜橙汽水、宁夏青铜峡市饮料厂的健身可乐，细菌总数分别超出要求的350倍和22倍。尤其是北京顺义的金虎牌七星可乐和冰联汽水，大肠杆菌群超过国家卫生标准。
    轻工部要求，这次抽查中卫生安全指标不合格者，要立即停产整顿，产品停止销售。二氧化碳达不到标准的，应逐步更新设备、改进操作工艺，尽快达到国家标准。
