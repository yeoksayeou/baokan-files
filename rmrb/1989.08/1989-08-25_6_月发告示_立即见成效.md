Title: Notice in June Shows Immediate Effect

Edition: 6

This notice issued in June, after being posted on the doors of the offices and dormitories of the people's court of Yiyang County, Hunan, has already seen 11 instances of people who came to plead or offer gifts voluntarily retreating.

The practice of refusing invitations, rejecting gifts, and declining intercessions has been in place at this court for many years. For this purpose, the court has specially set up a registration book. From this, we have compiled the following statistics: from January 1988 to July of this year, the entire court's staff refused 166 invitations, declined 307 intercessions, and rejected 293 gifts, with a total value of 23,413 yuan.

To ensure that people's judges are under public supervision, in early July of this year, this court sent letters to 329 people's representatives and 110 political consultative committee members in the county, requesting them to supervise the court's staff and judicial work. The court stipulates that twice a year, letters will be sent to people's representatives and political consultative committee members to evaluate the court's staff's law enforcement and integrity. Additionally, 24 "supervisors" have been appointed in the 9 grassroots court locations throughout the county. Members of the court's party committee insist on going to the grassroots court locations twice a month at fixed times to accept public supervision. After receiving feedback from the public that the court's work lacks transparency, the party committee of the court immediately studied and formulated a plan to implement "seven public disclosures" for the people, including the internal structure of the court, the division of responsibilities, the discipline of judicial police, supervision methods, and the handling of cases from acceptance to conclusion. Last month, the party committee of this court was awarded the title of "Advanced Party Organization of the Region in 1989" by the Yiyang Regional Party Committee.

    6月发告示　立即见成效
  　这份6月告示，自从贴到湖　南益阳县人民法院各办公室和干警宿舍门上以后，已有11次上门求情送礼者自动退回。
    拒请吃、拒受礼、拒说情的作风在这个法院已实行多年，为此，院里还特地设立了登记本，我们从上面统计到这样一组数字：1988年1月至今年7月，全院干警拒请166人次，拒说情307人次，拒受礼293人次，礼物合计金额23413元。
    为了使人民法官置身于人
    民监督之中，今年7月上旬，这个法院向本县329名人大代表和110名政协委员发去公函，恳请他们对法院干警和审判工作进行监督。法院规定，每年两次函请人大代表和政协委员评判法院干警执法和廉洁情况。另外还在全县9个基层法庭所在地聘请了24名“监督员”，院党组成员坚持每月两天定人、定时、定员到基层法庭所在地接受群众监督。有群众提出法院工作透明度不高的意见后，院党组立即研究制订了向人民群众实行“法院内设机构、分管职责、法警纪律、监督办法和执法中的案件受理、审理、办结七公开”。上月，这个法院党组被益阳地委授予“1989年度地区先进党组织”称号。
