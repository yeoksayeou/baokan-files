The State Council recently issued a notice requiring the people's governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as relevant departments under the State Council, to strengthen the cotton procurement work for 1989, and ensure the completion of the state contract procurement tasks.

The notice states that this year, due to the high attention and strong leadership given by the people's governments of all cotton-producing provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to cotton production, the national cotton planting area has increased compared to the planned figure. If the weather remains normal in the next two months, a good harvest can be expected.

As the new cotton procurement season is approaching, the State Council's notice puts forward eight requirements for doing a good job in cotton procurement:

1.	Effectively strengthen the leadership of cotton procurement work. Local governments at all levels should adhere to the overall situation, policy, and discipline consciousness, and regard this year's cotton procurement work as a major task to stabilize the market, stabilize the overall situation, and maintain social stability. Cotton-producing areas should have a responsible comrade in charge of cotton procurement work. Support the supply and marketing cooperatives to strictly implement policies, coordinate relationships between regions and departments, and timely solve problems that arise during procurement. If disorder during procurement leads to serious economic losses, the responsible leaders should be held accountable.

2.	Strengthen propaganda and ideological work among farmers. Use various forms to educate farmers on the situation and patriotism, calling on cotton farmers to support national economic construction as their honorable duty, and to sell the cotton they should deliver according to the contract to the state. Educate farmers to strengthen their policy and legal awareness, and to deliver cotton according to procurement policies and standards.

3.	Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should do a good job in organizing cotton procurement. Adhere to the principle of dividing areas and points, and procure according to the contract at the appointed time. During the procurement process, correctly implement the national cotton standards and price policies, and handle matters according to the inspection procedures, neither pressing down grades and prices nor raising grades and prices. Provide high-quality services for cotton farmers and facilitate their cotton sales. The departments of agricultural production materials and petrochemicals should timely supply cotton reward-selling fertilizers and diesel, and ensure the implementation of reward-selling policies. Economic measures independently formulated by various places for the development of cotton production shall not be reflected in the procurement prices, and no temporary preferential measures shall be added.

4.	Do everything possible to ensure the supply of cotton procurement funds and strictly prevent issuing "white notes" (IOUs). The People's Bank of China should arrange cotton procurement funds as a key point for the autumn agricultural and sideline product procurement. The Agricultural Bank should timely issue loans. Supply and marketing cooperatives should seriously clean up the occupation of internal funds and jointly do a good job in the supply of funds. During the settlement of procurement, cash should be given to cotton farmers who demand cash, and the payment of fixed and current savings deposit books should be guaranteed to be redeemed at any time.

5.	Strictly implement the decision of the State Council on the unified procurement and operation of cotton by supply and marketing cooperatives, and not to open the cotton market. Except for supply and marketing cooperatives (cotton in the breeding area is entrusted to the cotton mill for procurement), no other units (including joint ventures with foreign capital) or individuals shall procure and operate cotton. Do not implement a dual-track price system. Spinning mills shall not procure or purchase cotton in any form in the producing areas. Localities should further clean up and rectify small spinning mills. The administration for industry and commerce should continue to take decisive measures to strengthen the management of the cotton market, and eliminate cotton peddlers. Those who bully the market, forcefully buy and sell, and disrupt the procurement order shall be punished according to law.

6.	During the procurement season, the State Council will dispatch "cotton procurement inspection teams" to focus on inspecting adjacent provincial cotton areas and handling problems. The inspection teams will be composed of personnel from the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Supervision, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the State Price Bureau, and the State Bureau of Technical Supervision. The people's governments of cotton-producing areas can also organize inspection teams to inspect adjacent areas within the province.

7.	To ensure that the state can control more cotton resources, do a good job in cotton supply and demand balance, and guarantee the needs of the textile industry, domestic market, and foreign trade exports, all localities must truthfully report the cotton procurement quantity and not underreport.

8.	This year is the first year of implementing the cotton output and input quota system. The output quota tasks of major cotton-producing areas must be completed on schedule and in full. The sales of cotton retained under the quota system must also be implemented in accordance with the state's regulations. State reserve cotton must be managed according to the system of designated places, quantities, and responsible persons. Without the approval of the Ministry of Commerce, it shall not be used at will.

    国务院要求做好棉花收购工作
    通知各地各部门确保完成合同定购任务
    新华社北京8月27日电　国务院最近发出通知，要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府和国务院有关部门，加强1989年度棉花收购工作，确保棉花合同定购任务的完成。
    通知说，今年，由于各产棉省、自治区、直辖市人民政府高度重视并加强了对棉花生产的领导，全国棉花播种面积比预计有所增加，今后两个月如气候正常，可望获得好收成。
    当前新棉收购在即，为做好棉花收购工作，国务院的通知提出8点要求：
    一、切实加强对棉花收购工作的领导。各级人民政府要坚持全局观念、政策观念、纪律观念，把今年棉花收购工作，作为稳定市场、稳定大局、维护社会安定的一件大事来抓。棉区政府要有一位负责同志主抓棉花收购工作。要支持供销合作社认真执行政策，协调好地区之间、部门之间的关系，及时解决收购工作中出现的问题。收购中出现混乱导致经济遭受严重损失的，要追究主管领导的责任。
    二、加强对农民的宣传动员和思想政治工作。要利用各种形式，对农民进行形势教育和爱国主义教育，号召广大棉农把支援国家经济建设作为自己应尽的光荣义务，按照合同规定，把应交售的棉花全部卖给国家。要教育农民增强政策和法制观念，按照收购政策和标准交售棉花。
    三、各级供销合作社要做好棉花收购组织工作。要坚持划片定点，约时按合同收购。在收购过程中，要正确执行国家棉花标准和价格政策，按检验规程办事，既不得压级压价，也不得抬级抬价。要为棉农提供优质服务，方便棉农售棉。农业生产资料部门、石油化工部门要及时供应棉花奖售化肥、柴油，保证奖售政策兑现。各地为发展棉花生产而自行规定的经济措施，一律不得体现在收购价格中，并不得临时增加优惠措施。
    四、要千方百计保证棉花收购资金供应，严格防止打“白条”。中国人民银行要把收棉资金作为秋季农副产品收购的重点来安排，农业银行要及时发放贷款。供销合作社要认真清理内部资金占用，共同做好资金的供应工作。收购结算时，棉农要现金的给现金，支付定活两便储蓄存单的，要保证随时兑现。
    五、要坚决贯彻执行国务院关于棉花由供销合作社统一收购、经营，不开放棉花市场的决定。除供销合作社外（良繁区的棉花委托良棉厂收购），其他任何单位（包括中外合资企业）、个人，都不得收购、经营棉花。不搞价格双轨制。纱厂不得以任何方式到产区收购或套购棉花。各地要进一步清理整顿小纱厂。工商行政管理部门要继续采取坚决措施，加强棉花市场管理，取缔棉花商贩。对欺行霸市、强买强卖、扰乱收购秩序的不法分子，要依法惩处。
    六、在收购季节由国务院派出“棉花收购巡视组”，重点到毗邻省棉区巡回检查，查处问题。巡视组由国家计委、监察部、商业部、农业部、纺织部、国家工商行政管理局、国家物价局、国家技术监督局派员组成。棉区人民政府也可组织巡视组，在省内毗邻地区巡回检查。
    七、为了确保国家能够更多地掌握棉花资源，做好棉花收支平衡工作，保障纺织工业、国内市场和外贸出口的需要，各地必须如实上报棉花收购数量，不得瞒报。
    八、今年是实行棉花调出调入包干的第一年，各主要产棉区的调出包干任务必须按计划如期、如数完成。包干留成棉花的销售，也要执行国家规定的政策。国家储备棉必须按照定地点、定数量、定负责人的制度加强管理，未经商业部批准，不得擅自动用。
