A new type of chimney for civil use, made from clay instead of steel, has recently been developed by the Zhongxing New Building Materials Factory in Beijing's Fengtai District and is now in mass production.

This new type of chimney is made primarily from magnesia and salt, with glass fiber as the framework, and is produced using a special composite process. Compared to iron chimneys, it has the advantages of high compressive strength, resistance to deformation from drops or throws, comparable weight, lower production costs, and a longer service life. Additionally, this chimney is corrosion-resistant, non-toxic, and allows soot to fall off automatically. It can also be used in conjunction with iron chimneys.

    以“土”代钢民用烟筒问世
    新华社北京8月6日电  （通讯员谢东光）一种以“土”代钢的新型民用烟筒，最近由北京市丰台区中兴新型建材厂研制成功，并已投入批量生产。
    这种新型民用烟筒是以菱苦土、盐卤等为主料，以玻璃纤维为骨架，经特殊工艺复合而成的。它同铁皮烟筒相比，具有抗压性强、摔扔不变形、重量相仿、制作成本低、使用寿命长等特点。另外，这种烟筒还具有耐腐蚀、无毒、烟灰可自动脱落等优点，并能同铁制烟筒配合使用。
