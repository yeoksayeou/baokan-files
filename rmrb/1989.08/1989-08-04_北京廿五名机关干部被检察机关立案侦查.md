    Twenty-five Beijing Officials Investigated for Corruption
    Beijing, August 4 (Xinhua) - From January to July this year, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, in its campaign against corruption and bribery, has investigated 25 officials from various government departments and agencies for embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes. Eleven of them have been arrested. Among the suspects are government officials, law enforcement personnel from the procuratorate, public security, tax, and industrial and commercial administration departments, as well as grassroots managers in charge of scarce resources.

    From March to June 1988, Zhang Bin, deputy director of the Third Division of a certain bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture, accepted bribes totaling over 7,000 yuan and three boxes of Maotai liquor from the director of a certain liquor factory in Guizhou Province while evaluating national and department-level quality products. Zhang Yue, a police officer from the Chaoyang Gate Substation of the Dongcheng District Public Security Bureau, colluded with Zhao Xingtian, a deputy section chief from the Dongcheng District Procuratorate, to extort 45,000 yuan from relevant parties during the process of clearing debts for a certain company on behalf of the district government. Zhang Yue received 25,000 yuan, while Zhao Xingtian received 20,000 yuan. Ming Dingyong, a tax official from the Guanhuo Tax Office of the Chaoyang District Tax Bureau, abused his authority to extort 7,200 yuan from a taxpayer.

    Currently, seven of these cases have been concluded, while the rest are still under investigation.

    北京廿五名机关干部被检察机关立案侦查
    本报北京八月四日讯　今年一至七月，北京市检察机关在反贪污、反受贿的斗争中，先后对二十五名贪污、受贿或参与其它经济犯罪活动的党政机关干部立案侦查，其中十一人已被依法逮捕。他们当中，有政府机关干部，有检察、公安、税务、工商等执法部门的工作人员，也有掌管紧俏物资的“有实权”的基层管理干部。
      一九八八年三月至六月，农业部某司三处副处长张滨在负责评选本系统部优、国优产品的工作中，接受参加产品评比的贵州省某酒厂厂长的贿赂七千余元和茅台酒三箱。北京市公安局东城分局交道口派出所民警张越，勾结东城区人民检察院干部赵兴田（副处级），在受区政府委托为某公司清理债权债务的过程中，索取有关当事人贿赂四万五千元。张越实得二万五千元，赵兴田实得两万元。朝阳区税务局管庄税务所专管员明定勇在工作中利用职权，一次就索取纳税人贿赂款七千二百元。
    目前，上述案件中有七件已侦查终结，其余案件正在继续侦查。（缪震）
