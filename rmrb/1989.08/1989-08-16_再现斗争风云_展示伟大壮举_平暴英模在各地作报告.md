Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 16th.

Heroes of the crackdown on the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing have been giving reports across the country. By August 12th, six teams had arrived in various cities, including Shijiazhuang, Xi'an, Changsha, Nanchang, Hefei, and Jinan, to give their first reports. Audiences unanimously reflected that the heroes' reports "relived the stormy struggle and showcased great deeds." After listening to the reports, people felt even more that the central government's decision to crack down on the counter-revolutionary rebellion was wise and correct, that the troops enforcing martial law were respectable and lovable, and that the rioters were despicable and detestable.

In Shaanxi Province Sports Stadium, the first report was broadcast live on television to thousands of households. In Jinan, Jiang Chunquan, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, presided over the first report. The fifth team's first report in Hefei deeply moved more than 1,700 listeners. In Changsha, more than 6,000 party, government, and military officials and masses listened to the heroes' reports. From August 12th to 14th, the heroes of the crackdown gave three reports in the heroic city of Nanchang, with over 7,000 attendees. On August 11th, leaders of the Party, government, and military in Hebei Province, including Ying Congzhi, Li Wenxuan, and Yue Qifeng, warmly received the heroes. The heroes' reports in Shijiazhuang sparked a strong response.
