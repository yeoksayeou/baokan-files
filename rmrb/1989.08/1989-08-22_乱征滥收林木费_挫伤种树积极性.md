Title: Arbitrary Collection of Forestry Fees Dampens Tree-Planting Enthusiasm

		The arbitrary collection of forestry fees has dampened the enthusiasm for tree planting. This spring, during the tree-planting season, many farmers in Zhangshifu Township, Pingyuan County, were busy felling their own trees, and many young saplings were not spared. In some villages, the number of trees has decreased by 63.7% compared to last year.

		The root of the problem lies in the decision made by some village committees in Zhangshifu Township to levy forestry fees on various trees planted by farmers in front of and behind their houses. Each tree is required to pay 1.2 yuan annually, and this fee is to be collected every year. Farmers did the math: each household has planted tens of trees, amounting to an annual fee of tens of yuan, which is a significant expense. By the time these trees mature, it is uncertain whether they will be profitable. Therefore, many farmers chose to cut down their trees rather than pay the fees.

		This economically shortsighted behavior has caused strong dissatisfaction among the farmers.

    乱征滥收林木费　挫伤种树积极性
    今年春季植树造林，我县张士府乡许多农民却忙于砍伐自有林木，不少幼树都难以幸免，有的村林木比去年下降了63.7％。
    事情的起因是，张士府乡一些村委会决定对农民房前屋后自种的各种树木征收林木费，每棵树每年须缴纳1.2元，并规定今后年年都照此办理。农民算了一笔帐：现在每户都栽有二三十棵树，每年须缴纳三四十元，这是一笔不小的开支，到时这些树还不知是否成材，与其先缴钱，不如先砍树。
    这种经济上急功近利的短期行为，引起农民的强烈不满。
