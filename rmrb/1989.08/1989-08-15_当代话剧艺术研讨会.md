The development of drama since the new period has been encouraging, with a large number of plays reflecting the contradictions of reform life, portraying the complex psychological states of characters in real life, and pursuing and breaking through in artistic expression. How to evaluate the current state of drama art was the central topic of the recent drama art development discussion held in Beidaihe.

The conference, jointly organized by the Chinese Drama Literature Research Association and the Jilin Provincial Cultural Bureau, was attended by more than 30 scholars and experts from Beijing, Jilin, and other places.

The evaluation of the development of drama art in the new period often focuses on the views of experimental drama. Some people believe that experimental drama is the mainstream of contemporary Chinese drama and a symbol of Chinese drama's transition from modernity to contemporaneity. Others believe that the main body of Chinese drama is realistic creation. After a period of exploration, realism will show a trend of return. Participants discussed this issue.

Crisis, recession, and predicament are hot topics in the drama circle and the central issue of this conference. Some people advocate for a lonely art, suggesting that one should not be afraid of having no audience. Others believe that drama should humble itself and build a bridge to connect with the audience. However, regardless of how long the current recession of drama will last, the representatives at the conference share a common belief: the position of drama as an art form is eternal.

Another topic of the conference was the evaluation of the recent phenomenon of Northeast drama. In the context of a generally sluggish drama industry, Northeast drama has emerged as a strong force, bringing a vigorous Northeast wind to the drama stage with its simple and robust artistic charm. People believe that the recently concluded Northeast Drama Festival was a review of drama art. Everyone expressed great concern and appreciation for the creation of the host province's Jilin playwrights. The Jilin playwrights spoke, saying that they sincerely hope that critics can be more patient and meticulous in understanding the writers' feelings and hardships. Writers should have direct dialogues with experts, scholars, and theorists to jointly develop drama art. The conference also awarded prizes for excellent drama papers and monographs.

    当代话剧艺术研讨会
    新时期以来，话剧艺术的发展令人鼓舞，涌现了一大批反映改革生活的矛盾，表现现实生活中复杂的人物心态，在艺术上有追求和突破的话剧、如何评价话剧艺术的现状是最近在北戴河召开的话剧艺术发展讨论会上的中心议题。
    由中国话剧文学研究会与吉林省文化厅联合召开的这次会议，有北京和吉林等地三十多名学者、专家参加。
    对新时期话剧艺术发展的评价，争议焦点往往在对实验话剧的看法上，有人认为实验话剧是中国当代话剧的主潮，是中国话剧从现代走向当代的标志；有人则认为中国话剧的主体是现实主义的创作。在经历一番探索后，现实主义将出现一种回归趋势。与会者对此进行了讨论。
    危机、不景气、困境，是话剧界热门话题，也是此次会议讨论的中心。有人提倡孤独的艺术，主张不要怕没有观众；也有人认为话剧要放下架子，架一座接通观众的桥梁。然而，无论当前话剧的不景气状况还将持续多长时间，与会代表有一共同信念：话剧作为一门艺术的地位是永存的。
    会议的另一议题，是对近年涌现的东北话剧现象的评议。在话剧界普遍不景气的今天，东北话剧异军突起，以其质朴、刚健的艺术魅力，给话剧舞台吹来一股强劲的东北风。人们认为刚刚结束的东北话剧节是对话剧艺术的一次检阅。大家对东道主吉林省剧作家的创作表示极大的关注和赞赏。吉林剧作家发言说，他们真诚地希望评论家能够更耐心更细致地体察作家的心境和苦衷，作家与专家学者、理论家直接对话，共同发展话剧艺术。会议还颁发了戏剧优秀论文和专著奖。
