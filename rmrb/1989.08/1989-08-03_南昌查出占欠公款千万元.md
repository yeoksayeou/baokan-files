Recently, Nanchang City in Jiangxi Province has uncovered a total of 11.86 million yuan in public funds that have been misappropriated or unpaid by officials and employees. Among them, 40 county-level officials are involved, and 57 individuals owe more than 100,000 yuan each.

It has been learned that these individuals did not default on public funds due to financial hardships in their personal lives. A staff member from the Science and Technology Association of Anyi County stopped receiving a salary in 1983 to manage several enterprises. During this period, he built a three-story private residence and equipped it with all necessary household appliances, including a color television and a refrigerator. However, this individual still owes 330,000 yuan in public funds.

Additionally, many people have used the unpaid public funds to start businesses or engage in commercial activities.

    南昌查出占欠公款千万元
    本报南昌电　日前，江西省南昌市已清查出干部职工拖欠和侵占公款达1186万元。其中有县级干部40人，欠款万元以上的有57人。
    据了解这些人拖欠公款并不是因为家庭生活困难。安义县科协一名干部，1983年停薪留职后承包了几个企业，这期间他新建了一栋3层楼的私房，彩电、冰箱等家用电器一应俱全。然而，此人竟拖欠公款3.3万元。
    还有不少人将拖欠的公款拿去办企业、做生意了。
