Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, August 17th.

Yugoslav Federal Foreign Minister Lončar pointed out that the Non-Aligned Movement is currently at a critical juncture and must therefore undergo reforms to achieve modernization.

Lončar made these remarks while discussing preparations for the 9th Summit of Non-Aligned Countries with the South News Agency. This summit is scheduled to be held in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, from September 4th to 7th.

Lončar said that although the Cold War is thawing and global conditions are improving, this does not affect the existence of the Non-Aligned Movement or its fundamental principles. To make the world more stable and secure, the Non-Aligned Movement is still necessary.

The Yugoslav foreign minister emphasized that the Non-Aligned Movement is at a critical juncture: either it reforms or it is relegated to a secondary position. He stated that at the foreign ministers' meeting in Nicosia, participants unanimously decided that the Non-Aligned Movement must undergo reforms and pursue modernization.

Lončar said that the essence of modernizing the Non-Aligned Movement is to keep pace with the times. He stressed that the Non-Aligned Movement should act swiftly and effectively; it should engage in dialogue with the East, West, and North rather than engage in confrontation; it should seek constructive solutions rather than just issuing appeals. He said that through modernization, the Non-Aligned Movement should make the world more in need of and more accepting of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Lončar then pointed out that relations between the East and West have eased, but relations between the South and North have not. Therefore, another important agenda item for the 9th Summit of Non-Aligned Countries is economic issues, including the development of developing countries, the debt crisis, and the establishment of a new international economic order.

### 南斯拉夫外长隆查尔说  不结盟运动必须改革

    南斯拉夫外长隆查尔说
    不结盟运动必须改革
    新华社贝尔格莱德8月17日电　南斯拉夫联邦外交部长隆查尔指出，不结盟运动目前正处于决定命运的分水岭，因而必须进行改革，实现不结盟运动的现代化。
    隆查尔外长是在向南通社谈第9次不结盟国家首脑会议的筹备工作时说这番话的。这次首脑会议将于9月4日至7日在南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德举行。
    隆查尔说，冷战在融化，世界形势在好转，但这不影响不结盟运动的存在，不影响不结盟运动的基本原则。为了使世界更稳定、更安全，不结盟运动仍然是需要的。
    南斯拉夫外长强调，不结盟运动正处在决定命运的分水岭：是进行改革还是被排挤到次要地位。他说，在尼科西亚举行的不结盟国家外长会议上与会者一致决定，不结盟运动要进行改革，要走现代化的道路。
    隆查尔说，不结盟运动现代化的实质是要跟上时代的步伐。他强调，不结盟运动应迅速而有效地行动；要同东方、西方和北方进行对话，而不是进行对抗；要寻求建设性的解决办法而不仅仅是发出呼吁。他说，通过运动的现代化，要使世界更需要不结盟运动，更能接受不结盟运动。
    隆查尔接着指出，东西方关系已出现缓和，但南北方关系尚未缓和，因此第9次不结盟国家首脑会议的另一个重要议题是经济问题，其中包括发展中国家的发展问题和债务危机以及建立国际经济新秩序等问题。
