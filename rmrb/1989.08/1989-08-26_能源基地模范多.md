	Chinese intellectuals
	With wisdom flying side by side
	Is the steadfast belief
	Loyalty to the yellow earth
	Difficulties thus flee
	Wind-like vigor is dedication
	“New Type Dishler Tube Mill”
	Is the token you give to the motherland

	Senior engineer Zhou Guozhang of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant designed and developed China's first computer-controlled 2800 variable-section straightening machine in 1982, surpassing the level of the imported sample machine from the United States. Subsequently, in just two years, he completed the design, manufacturing, and intermediate industrial trial of the new type Dishler tube mill.

	When self-deprecation roars
	You stand firmly in the East
	Releasing doves to the blue sky
	Extracting black gold from the earth
	Colleagues from home and abroad give thumbs up
	You smile slightly
	We, Chinese workers,
	Can be the foundation, and even the peak

	Foreman Wang Tianrun of Antaibao Open-Pit Mine dug the first shovel for the modernized large-scale open-pit mine in 1987. His team created the highest record of 27,375 tons per shift. In 1986, he was named a provincial labor model, in 1988 he was awarded the national "May 1st Labor Medal," and this year he was named a provincial first-class labor model.

	The legend of Yu Gong has been passed down for generations
	There are as many heroes who move mountains
	You brushed away the snow on your forehead
	Resolutely swung the pickaxe at the "slag mountain"
	Wisdom and perseverance both strive
	Hope and determination are held high
	The stubborn iron bull lies down
	The world erupts in cheers

	Li Shuangliang, the contractor of the slag yard at Taiyuan Steel, led workers to remove 4/5 of the slag mountain covering 2.3 square kilometers and 23 meters high in five years, and built a park. Last year, he received the gold medal and the title of "Global 500" from the United Nations Environment Program.

	There is such a turner
	Time fears his running
	Day and night, praying endlessly—
	Slow down, I really can't run anymore
	There is such a turner
	Like Kuafu, he is an evergreen pine
	Achievements cannot hold back his belief
	Lightning cannot strike down his body

	Turner Li Peixin of Jinxi Machinery Factory is known as the "Iron Man." Since entering the factory in 1958, he has suffered seven work-related injuries, with fractures in four places, and completed 7,194.15 work hours in 10 years, equivalent to 36 years and 5 months of work. In 1986, he was awarded the national "May 1st Labor Medal," and in 1986 and 1989, he was named a provincial first-class labor model twice.

    能源基地模范多
    周国彰
    中国牌知识分子
    与睿智比翼齐飞的
    是执著的信念
    对黄土地的忠诚
    困难因此而逃遁
    风一般茁壮的是奉献
    “新型狄舍尔轧管机”
    是你送给祖国的信物
    太原重型机器厂高级工程师周国彰，1982年设计与研制出我国第一台计算机控制的2800变断面矫直机，超过从美国引进的样机水平。之后仅用两年时间就完成了新型狄舍尔轧管机设计制造和中间性工业试验。
    王天润
    当自卑的呼啸泛滥
    你顽强地挺立在东方
    往蓝天放飞鸽子
    去地下摄取乌金
    中外同行翘起了拇指
    你却微微一笑
    我们中国工人
    能做基石，更能做绝峰
    安太堡露天矿工长王天润，1987年为现代化大型露天矿剥离了第一铲。他的小组创造了班产27375吨的最高纪录。1986年他被评为省劳模，1988年荣获全国“五一”劳动奖章，今年他又被评为省特级劳模。
    李双良
    愚公的传说传了多少代
    就有多少挖山的好汉
    你抚了抚额际的雪花
    毅然将镐锄抡向“渣山”
    智慧和毅力齐奋
    希望与决心同举
    倔拗的铁牛卧下之时
    世界爆出一阵喝彩
    太钢渣场承包负责人李双良，带领职工5年搬掉废钢渣堆起的占地2.3平方公里、高23米的渣山的4／5，并建成一座公园。去年他获联合国环境署颁发的金质奖章和“全球500佳”称号。
    李培信
    有这样一个车工
    时间害怕他的竞走
    昼夜里祷告不止——
    慢点吧，我实在跑不动
    有这样一个车工
    如夸父似不老的岩松
    成绩扯不住他的信念
    雷电击不倒他的身躯
    国营晋西机器厂车工李培信，号称“铁人”。他1958年入厂后，七次负工伤，四处骨折，10年完成工时7194.15个，相当于36年零5个月的工作量。1986年获全国“五一”劳动奖章，1986、1989年两次评为省特级劳模。（附图片）
