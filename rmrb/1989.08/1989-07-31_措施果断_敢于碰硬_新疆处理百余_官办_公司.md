Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 31st — (Reporter Li Xian Guo) Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has taken decisive measures to clean up and rectify companies, daring to take on challenges. Over 130 "government-run" companies have been dealt with.

Since mid-August last year, the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Government have taken resolute measures to investigate and punish those companies run by party and government agencies that engage in fraud, speculation, and the illegal trading of important production and living materials and scarce commodities. Significant progress has been made. Statistics show that, up to now, a total of 156 companies and enterprises run by party and government agencies at various levels within the region have been identified as falling within the scope of the cleanup. Among these, 36 are run by autonomous region-level agencies, 107 by prefectures, cities, and counties, and 13 by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. After thorough examination, over 130 of these companies have been dealt with through measures such as closure, dissolution, and decoupling, accounting for 83.9% of the total.

The Xinjiang Kunlun Trade Company has repeatedly engaged in the illegal resale of aluminum ingots, white cloth, and other scarce production and living materials, causing a negative impact on society. The Autonomous Region Supervision Bureau recently made a decision to confiscate the company's illegal gains of over 310,000 yuan and to demote the company's manager, Chi Deyan, from his administrative position.

    措施果断　敢于碰硬
    新疆处理百余“官办”公司
    据新华社乌鲁木齐7月31日电　（记者李现国）新疆维吾尔自治区清理整顿公司敢于碰“硬”，130多家“官办”公司受到处理。
    自去年8月中旬以来，自治区党委和自治区人民政府采取果断措施，坚决查处那些弄虚作假，倒买倒卖重要生产生活资料和紧俏商品的“官办”公司，已取得很大成绩。据统计，到目前为止，全区共查出属于清理范围的党政机关办的公司企业156家，其中自治区级机关办的36家，州地市县办的107家，生产建设兵团办的13家。经过认真清理，已采取停办、撤销、脱钩等办法处理的130多家，占总数的83.9％。新疆昆仑贸易公司多次转手加价倒卖铝锭、白坯布等生产生活紧俏商品，在社会上造成了很坏的影响。自治区监察厅最近作出处理决定：没收这家公司非法所得31万多元，给予该公司经理迟德晏行政撤职处分。
