    Mianyang Contract Dispute Case Renders First Instance Verdict
    By Luo Maocheng, Correspondent of People's Daily in Chengdu

    The People's Daily reported on July 10th, 30th, and August 19th last year about the dispute between the Mianyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce and the Mianyang Municipal Food Company over the unilateral termination of a contract by the Bureau of Commerce. Recently, the Mianyang Intermediate People's Court rendered a first-instance verdict: the contract for the operation of the franchise is terminated; both parties' breaches of contract are not pursued for economic responsibility; the litigation fees for this case are to be borne 25% by the plaintiff, the Food Company, and 75% by the defendant, the Bureau of Commerce. The plaintiff appealed on the spot; the defendant expressed respect for the court's verdict.

    After the People's Daily continuously reported on the Mianyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce's unlawful actions and unilateral termination of the contract, relevant leaders took notice. The Mianyang Intermediate Court accepted the case on October 6th last year and began the trial in early March this year, rendering the verdict recently.

    Through the court's investigation and repeated audits by the audit department, it was found that in September 1987, Wang Bin, a research officer of the Food Company, signed a four-year franchise contract with the Bureau of Commerce. The contract stipulated: "The first two years are loss-sharing, and the latter two years are profit-sharing." However, after the contract was signed, the national supply of pork became tense, and the purchase and sale prices were severely inverted. At this time, neighboring cities and counties opened their pork prices, but in Mianyang, the municipal government did not allow it, causing a large amount of pork to flow out, and the Food Company's losses increased dramatically. It was not until December that the Mianyang Municipal Government agreed to open the selling price, after which the Food Company turned losses into profits month by month. Seeing this situation, the leaders of the Bureau of Commerce, in early May 1988, cited the severe losses incurred by the franchisee in the first four months of 1987 to demand unilateral termination of the contract. The franchisee disagreed, requesting to digest the losses independently and continue the franchise, but was not agreed to. The Bureau of Commerce forcibly terminated the contract at the end of June and re-tendered the franchise. Thus, the franchisee sued the court, requesting to declare the defendant's aforementioned actions invalid and compensate for the economic losses caused thereby.

    The court held that the plaintiff lost 13.8 million yuan in 1987, the reason being the severe inversion of purchase and sale prices, as well as operational decision-making errors. The Bureau of Commerce's unilateral termination of the contract was incorrect and should bear corresponding responsibility. However, due to the change in circumstances, the original franchise contract has lost the possibility of continued performance, and thus rendered the aforementioned verdict.

    After the first-instance verdict, the reporter heard various opinions from people in Mianyang about whether the court's verdict was fair and whether the facts aligned with the verdict. There were also those who expressed difficulty in understanding the litigation fees, with the winning party paying more and the losing party paying less.

### 绵阳合同纠纷案作出一审判决

    绵阳合同纠纷案作出一审判决
    本报成都电　记者罗茂城报道：本报去年7月10日、30日和8月19日3次报道四川绵阳市商业局单方终止与市食品公司的合同纠纷。此案最近由绵阳市中级人民法院作出一审判决：承包经营合同终止履行；对双方违约行为免予追究经济责任；本案诉讼费由原告食品公司负担25％，被告商业局负担75％。原告不服，当庭提出上诉；被告则表示尊重法院的判决。
    本报去年连续报道绵阳市商业局不依法办事、单方解除合同的消息以后，引起有关领导的重视。绵阳市中院去年10月6日受理了此案，今年3月初开庭审理，最近才作出判决。
    通过法院的调查和审计部门的反复审计，查明1987年9月食品公司调研员王斌与商业局签订了为期4年的承包合同。合同规定：“前两年亏损包干，后两年盈利分成”。但合同签订以后，市场猪肉供应即出现全国性的紧张，购销价格严重倒挂。这时邻近市、县猪肉销价纷纷放开，而在绵阳城区，市政府不让放开，造成猪肉大量外流，食品公司亏损剧增。直到12月，绵阳市政府才同意放开销价，从此食品公司月月扭亏为盈。商业局领导看到这种情况，1988年5月初却以承包人1987年经营4个月亏损严重为由，要单方终止合同。承包人不同意，以1988年1—5月已盈利近百万元，请求自行消化亏损，继续承包，但未获同意。商业局于6月底强行解除了合同，另行招标承包。于是，承包人向法院起诉，请求确认被告的上述行为无效，并赔偿因此而造成的经济损失。
    法院认为，原告1987年超亏138万元，其原因是由于购销价格严重倒挂，也有经营决策失误的因素。商业局单方解除合同是错误的，也应负相应的责任。但由于情况发生了变化，原承包合同已失去继续履行的可能，从而作出了上述判决。
    一审判决后，记者在绵阳听到人们种种议论，对法院判决公不公、事实与判决符不符有不同看法。对诉讼费判胜诉方多出，败诉方少出，也有人表示难以理解。
