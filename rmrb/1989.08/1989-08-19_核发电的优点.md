The American professor of electrical engineering at the University of Colorado, Peter Beckman, believes that the nuclear accident that occurred at Three Mile Island ten years ago should be considered a fortunate event. This is because it was the first time in history that an energy source as large as 940,000 kilowatts lost control without harming anyone. This would not have been possible in any of the following situations: (1) the collapse of a hydroelectric dam; (2) an explosion at a refinery; (3) a fire at an oil storage facility powered by oil.

The reason the Three Mile Island nuclear accident did not result in casualties is not by chance but is due to the inherent safety of nuclear power. Nuclear energy concentrates 3.5 million times the amount of energy, making it very safe and stable. This level of safety is not achievable with mineral fuels or hydroelectric power, as it can delay any impending danger. It should be noted, however, that no reputable expert can guarantee that nuclear power is 100% safe.

Once a dam collapses, it can result in the deaths of thousands of people because there is no time to evacuate the residents in the dam area. Fires at thermal power plants or oil storage facilities often lead to the deaths of hundreds of people. Such accidents have occurred in various countries around the world and are too numerous to count. The number of deaths caused by coal-fired power is even more staggering. Gases produced by burning coal are the cause of lung diseases and other illnesses, which result in the premature deaths of an average of 37,000 people in the United States each year. Some experts estimate that if nuclear power were used instead, the number of deaths per 10 billion watts of electricity produced would be reduced by 72 people compared to coal-fired power.

In terms of environmental protection, nuclear power generation also has significant advantages. Compared to the waste from mineral fuels, the volume of nuclear waste is negligible, and its toxicity is temporary. The toxicity of nuclear waste decreases rapidly, and after 30 years, it is only necessary to prevent people from ingesting nuclear waste. After 100 years, its toxicity will be less than that of general minerals in nature; after 500 years, its toxicity will be less than that of coal ash. Unlike chemical and biological toxins, no matter how small the amount, nuclear toxins can be quickly detected.

Due to these superior qualities of nuclear power generation, the development of nuclear power plants worldwide is inevitable. Currently, France's nuclear power plants account for a significant portion of the country's total electricity generation, while nuclear power plants in the United States account for 20% of the country's total electricity generation.

    核发电的优点
    美国科罗拉多大学电力工程学名誉教授彼得·贝克曼认为，十年前发生在三哩岛上的核事故应当是一件值得庆幸的事，因为这是有史以来第一次一个高达94万千瓦的极大能量失去控制而未伤害任何人，这是下列任何一种情况发生时都不可能的：（1）水力发电站的大坝崩溃；（2）炼油厂爆炸；（3）以石油为燃料的工厂的油库失火。
    三哩岛核事故之所以未造成伤亡并不是偶然的，是来自核能所固有的安全性。原子核能将350万倍的能量集中起来，很安全稳定，这种安全性不是矿物燃料或水力所能做到的，它能延缓任何行将来临的危险。当然应该指出的是：不能要求任何有声望的专家能使核动力百分之百的安全。
    大坝一旦崩溃就会造成上千人的死亡，因为来不及使居住在坝区的人们撤离；火力发电站或油库起火亦往往导致上百人死亡。世界各国发生的这类事故，不胜枚举。而以煤为燃料造成的死亡人数更是惊人。燃煤产生的气体是肺病和其他疾病形成的原因，这些病使美国平均每年有37000人过早死亡。有的专家估计，如代之以核动力，则平均每生产10亿瓦特的电力比以煤为燃料要少死72人。
    再就是，以核为动力发电在环境保护方面也有很大好处，因为和矿物燃料的废料相比，核废料的体积是微不足道的，其毒性也是暂时的。核废料毒性的衰减速度很快，30年后只需防止人们吃进核废料；100年后，其毒性会小于自然界的一般矿石；500年后，其毒性将小于煤灰。和化学与生物的毒素不同，不论数量多么微小，核毒素都能很快监测出来。
    由于核动力发电所具有的这些优越性，世界各国核电站之日趋发展乃势所必然。法国目前核电站的发电量在其全国总发电量中已占有重要位置，而美国核电站的发电量已占美全国总发电量的20％。
