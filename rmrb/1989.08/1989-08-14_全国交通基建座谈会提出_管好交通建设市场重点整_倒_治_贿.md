The National Transportation Infrastructure Symposium, which concluded today in Tianjin, proposed that as a key area supported by the state, transportation construction must strive to improve the investment returns of construction projects and gradually establish a new order in the transportation construction market.

This symposium was jointly convened by the Ministry of Communications and the National Transportation Investment Company. Minister of Communications Qian Yongchang emphasized at the symposium that this year is crucial for completing the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for transportation infrastructure. The construction progress must be accelerated, deadlines must be met, and financial, material, and human resources must be concentrated to ensure the construction of key projects.

When arranging the transportation infrastructure plan for next year, the symposium proposed that transportation construction must continue to implement the rectification and rectification policies, strictly control the scale of investment, adjust the investment structure, and strive to improve the investment returns of transportation construction projects.

The symposium, in response to current problems in the transportation construction market, clearly proposed to strengthen the rectification and management of the transportation construction market, with a focus on eliminating corruption and bribery, and investigating illegal operations. In particular, illegal activities such as bribery, leaking of bid prices, subcontracting, selling licenses, selling materials, and unlicensed construction must be thoroughly investigated and dealt with.

    据新华社天津8月14日电　（记者张宏文、通讯员朱文惠）今天在天津结束的全国交通基建座谈会提出，作为国家重点支持的交通建设，要努力提高建设项目的投资效益，同时要逐步建立起交通建设市场的新秩序。
    这次座谈会是由交通部和国家交通投资公司联合召开的。交通部部长钱永昌在座谈会上强调指出，今年是完成“七五”交通基建任务最关键的一年。建设的进度要加快，工期要抓紧，要集中财力、物力和人力，确保重点工程建设。
    座谈会在安排明年交通基建计划时提出，交通建设也要继续贯彻治理、整顿的方针，严格控制投资规模，调整投资结构，努力提高交通建设项目的投资效益。
    座谈会针对当前交通建设市场存在的问题，明确提出要加强交通建设市场的整顿和管理，重点是整“倒”治“贿”，清查非法经营。特别是对行贿受贿、泄漏标底、倒手转包、出卖证照、倒卖材料、无照施工等不法行为，要认真查处。
