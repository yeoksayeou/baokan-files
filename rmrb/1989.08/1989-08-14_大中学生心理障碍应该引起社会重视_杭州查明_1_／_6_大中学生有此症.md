Psychological barriers among middle and high school students should be taken seriously by society. A recent survey in Hangzhou reveals that 1/6 of students have some form of psychological disorder.

A recent survey conducted in Hangzhou indicates that 1/6 of middle and high school students exhibit varying degrees of psychological disorders. The lack of health knowledge leading to psychological barriers should be highly regarded by families, schools, and society.

This research project was completed by the Seventh Hospital of Hangzhou, the Medical and Health Science and Technology Information Institute of Hangzhou, and the Educational Science Institute of Hangzhou. Starting in 1986, they conducted surveys in several middle and high schools in Hangzhou, collecting data from 2961 students (1523 males and 1438 females). Statistical analysis revealed that students in urban and rural areas, as well as in key and non-key schools, all face psychological health issues. Female students are more affected than male students, non-key schools have a higher proportion than key schools, and rural areas are more severely affected than urban areas. Additionally, the severity of these issues increases with age.

According to the researchers, the causes of students' psychological health problems include tension, exam anxiety, parental discord, dislike for studying, teacher-student relationships, and infatuation with the opposite sex. The primary cause of psychological barriers is the excessive expectations placed on students by their parents, leading to a fear of falling behind academically. To address these issues, the researchers propose the following strategies: developing "student psychological health software" to facilitate psychological health checks; offering "psychological health courses" in some schools to promote psychological health knowledge; collaborating with schools to provide psychological counseling and treatment; and promoting simple and effective "student psychological health exercises" to maintain and improve psychological functions.

    大中学生心理障碍应该引起社会重视
    杭州查明1／6大中学生有此症
    新华社杭州8月14日电（通讯员楼锦新、记者唐庆忠）杭州市新近进行的一项调查表明：这里有1／6的大、中学生存在不同程度的病态心理。因为缺乏卫生知识而产生的心理障碍，应引起家庭、学校和社会的高度重视。
    这项调查研究课题，是由杭州市第七医院、杭州市医药卫生科技情报所和杭州市教科所完成的。从1986年开始，他们在杭州市的一些大中学校中调查，在2961名学生（其中男生1523名，女生1438名）中获得上百万个数据。经统计分析发现，城市、农村，重点、非重点学校学生中均存在心理卫生问题。其中，女生比男生多，非重点学校比重点学校比例大，农村比城市严重，而且随年龄而递增。
    据研究人员分析，导致学生产生心理卫生问题的原因有心情紧张、考试焦虑、父母不睦、厌学情绪、师生关系、异性爱慕等几类。因父母对子女期望值过高，使学生害怕成绩落后，是形成心理障碍最重要的原因。针对这些问题，研究人员研究的对策是：编制“学生心理卫生软件”，为心理健康检查提供手段；在一些学校开设“心理卫生课”，普及心理卫生知识；配合学校开展心理咨询和心理治疗；在学生中推广简单易行的“学生心理保健操”，维护和改善心理功能。
