    U.S. Economic Growth Slows
    By Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Jiansheng

    This year, the U.S. economy has shown clear signs of slowing down. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's announcement on July 27, the U.S. real gross national product for the second quarter of this year grew by only 1.7% on an annualized basis, significantly lower than the 3.7% growth rate in the first quarter.

    What is more concerning to economists is that over the past two months, the U.S. has seen a continuous decline in industrial production, commodity retail sales, and enterprise equipment utilization rates, coupled with a rise in the unemployment rate. Based on this, some economists have repeatedly issued warnings about an impending "recession."

    However, most economists believe that the U.S. economy will not experience a recession this year, and although the economy will slow further next year, the likelihood of a recession is not high. They generally predict that the U.S. economy will grow by 2% to 2.5% this year, lower than the Bush administration's recent forecast of 2.7%. The growth rate for next year is expected to drop to 1% to 1.5%.

    The main factors supporting the continued growth of the U.S. economy this year are as follows:

    First, agricultural production has returned to normal levels. The drought last year caused a 25% reduction in U.S. agricultural output, resulting in a loss of $14.6 billion (in 1982 prices). The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently predicted that this year's grain production in the U.S. will reach 286 million tons, a 28% increase over last year, and higher than the normal level of 275 million tons in 1987.

    Second, the three main drivers of the U.S. economy's rapid growth last year—exports, enterprise fixed capital investment, and private consumption—continue to show some growth.

    Last year, primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, U.S. exports grew by 21.4%. This year, the U.S. dollar has appreciated somewhat, affecting U.S. exports, but due to the continued high growth rate of the global economy and the opening of markets to U.S. consumer goods under U.S. pressure, U.S. exports for the first five months of this year still grew by 15%. It is expected that the U.S. dollar will depreciate in the second half of the year, which will be beneficial for increasing exports.

    U.S. enterprise fixed capital investment grew by 11.2% in real terms last year, reaching a high level not seen in many years. The latest survey by the Department of Commerce shows that U.S. enterprises plan to increase real investment by 6.5% this year. According to Fortune magazine, U.S. private consumption spending is expected to grow by 2% this year.

    Third, the Federal Reserve has begun to ease monetary policy.

    Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has implemented a tight credit policy to curb inflation. Given the recent slowdown in the economy and the easing of inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve eased credit in early June and early July, reducing the prime lending rate from 11.5% to 10.5%. It is expected that the Federal Reserve will further ease credit in the coming months.

    Despite this, achieving the Federal Reserve's goal of a "soft landing"—a lower economic growth rate accompanied by mild inflation—will not be easy. In the first half of this year, U.S. consumer prices rose by 5.9% on an annualized basis, significantly higher than the 4.4% for the whole of last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts that consumer prices will rise by 5% to 5.5% for the whole year, making this the year with the highest inflation rate since 1981.

    Western analysts believe that in the coming period, the Federal Reserve will need to support economic growth while preventing inflation from resurging, and its easing of monetary policy will necessarily be limited. Additionally, although the U.S. fiscal and trade "twin deficits" have decreased somewhat this year, the amounts remain enormous; the widespread savings and loan crisis in the U.S. has not been resolved. These are all potential risks to the U.S. economy.

    Therefore, Greenspan also cannot guarantee the U.S. economy, stating in his economic report to Congress: "One day, something will end this surprising economic growth that has been ongoing since 1982." He said that policy errors by the Federal Reserve could trigger a new recession.

### 美国经济增长减速

    美国经济增长减速
    新华社记者　王建生
    今年以来，美国经济明显减速。据美国商务部七月二十七日宣布，今年第二季度美国的实际国民生产总值按年率计算仅增长了百分之一点七，大大低于第一季度百分之三点七的增幅。
    更令经济学家们忧虑的是，近两个月来，美国出现了工业生产、商品零售额、企业设备利用率等连续下降，失业率上升的局面。据此，一些经济学家不断发出关于“衰退”的警告声。
    但是，大多数经济学家认为，今年美国经济还不致于出现衰退，明年尽管经济会进一步减速，但衰退的可能性也不是很大。他们普遍预计，今年美国经济将增长百分之二至百分之二点五，低于布什政府最近预计的百分之二点七；明年的增长率将降至百分之一至百分之一点五。
    支撑今年美国经济继续增长的因素主要有以下几个方面：
    第一，农业生产恢复到正常水平。去年的干旱使美国的农业减产四分之一，产值减少一百四十六亿美元（以一九八二年不变价格计算）。美国农业部最近预计，今年美国的谷物产量将达二点八六亿吨，比去年增长百分之二十八，同时也高于正常年份一九八七年的二点七五亿吨。
    第二，去年推动美国经济快速增长的三大动力——出口、企业固定资本投资和私人消费仍保持一定的增长。
    去年，主要由于美元汇价下跌，美国的出口增长了百分之二十一点四。今年以来，美元汇价有所回升，美国的出口受到
  一定影响，但由于世界经济继续以较高的速度增长，以及在美国的高压下一些国家已经或正在向美国消费品开放市场，使今年头五个月美国的出口仍增长了百分之十五。预计今年下半年美元汇价将有所下滑，有利于增加出口。
    美国的企业固定资本投资去年实际增长了百分之十一点二，为多年来少有的高水平。商务部的最新调查表明，今年美国企业计划增加实际投资百分之六点五。另据《幸福》杂志预计，今年美国的私人消费开支将增长百分之二。
    第三，联邦储备委员会开始放松货币政策。
    在过去一年里，联邦储备委员会实行了紧缩信贷的货币政策，以遏制通货膨胀。鉴于近来经济明显减速、通货膨胀压力有所减轻，联邦储备委员会在六月初和七月初两度放松信贷，使商业银行的优惠贷款利率从百分之十一点五下降到百分之十点五。预计今后几月内联邦储备委员会还会进一步放松信贷。
    尽管如此，美国经济要实现联邦储备委员会提出的“软着陆”这一目标——即较低的经济增长率，并伴有温和的通货膨胀——也并非易事。今年上半年，美国的消费物价按年率计算上涨了百分之五点九，大大高于去年全年的百分之四点四。联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘预计，今年全年消费物价将上涨百分之五至百分之五点五，这将是自一九八一年以来通货膨胀率最高的一年。
    西方分析家认为，今后一段时间内，联邦储备委员会既要支持经济增长，但又不能使通货膨胀重新抬头，其放松货币政策的程度必然是有限的。另外，今年以来，美国的财政、外贸
  “双赤字”虽有所减少，但数额仍极其庞大；影响广泛的美国的储蓄贷款协会仍未摆脱危机。这些都是美国经济中的隐患。
    因此，格林斯潘也不敢给美国经济打保票，他在提交给国会的经济报告中说：
  “某一天，某件事将终止这次自一九八二年以来一直普遍存在的令人惊奇的经济增长。”他说，联邦储备委员会政策上的错误有可能触发一场新的衰退。
