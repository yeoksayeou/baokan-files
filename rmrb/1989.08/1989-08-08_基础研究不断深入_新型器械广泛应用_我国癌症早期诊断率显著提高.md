For cancer patients, early detection means an increased chance of cure—China's early cancer diagnosis capabilities are bringing more and more good news to people.

In recent years, China's basic cancer research has deepened, and new instruments and equipment have been widely applied, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of early cancer diagnosis.

Using a high-sensitivity technology improved by China to detect alpha-fetoprotein for liver cancer screening, liver cancer can be detected 7-9 months earlier than other methods. The discovery and study of a large number of early asymptomatic liver cancer cases have, for the first time in the world, achieved a historic leap from clinical liver cancer to asymptomatic subclinical small liver cancer, making China's research on subclinical small liver cancer consistently leading the world.

Cervical cancer has long threatened women's health and lives. In a few provinces and cities in China, population screening has been carried out, with an early detection rate of up to 80%. Shanghai has persistently conducted screening and treatment for textile female workers, detecting precancerous conditions or lesions early, reducing the incidence of cervical cancer from 128 per 100,000 in the 1950s to 8 per 100,000 in the 1980s.

Through long-term observation and research on the blood symptoms of the pre-leukemia period, Chinese medical workers have established a reliable diagnostic standard for the pre-leukemia period, creating conditions for the prevention and treatment of leukemia. Using China's designed esophageal brush cytology technology for esophageal cancer screening, and China's established simple and sensitive immunoenzyme labeling technology for nasopharyngeal cancer screening, the positive rate is over 90%, and the proportion of early-stage patients detected through screening is over 70%.

The progress in early cancer diagnosis technology has laid the foundation for determining high-risk groups, blocking canceration, and early prevention and treatment. It is reported that at present, the treatment level of various cancers in China has been significantly improved compared to the past. Among them, the most difficult to cure liver cancer has a five-year survival rate of nearly 75% for early-stage patients after surgery.

    基础研究不断深入　新型器械广泛应用
    我国癌症早期诊断率显著提高
    据新华社北京8月8日电  （实习生温闽、记者于长洪）对于癌症患者来说，及早一天发现，就增加一分治愈的希望——我国癌症早期诊断水平的提高正日益给人们带来福音。
    近年来，我国癌症基础研究不断深入，新仪器新设备广泛应用，这使癌症早期诊断的效率和准确性大大提高。
    利用经过我国改进的高敏技术检测甲胎蛋白普查肝癌，可以比其他方法早7—9个月发现肝癌。而大批早期无症状肝癌病例的发现、研究，在世界上首次完成了从临床肝癌到亚临床（临床前期）无症状小肝癌的历史性飞跃，从而使我国关于亚临床小肝癌的研究一直居世界领先地位。
    宫颈癌曾长期危及妇女的健康和生命。我国在很少省市开展了人群普查，早期发现病人比例高达80％。上海市对纺织女工长期坚持普查普治，及早发现癌前疾病或病变，使宫颈癌的发病率从50年代的128／10万降至80年代的8／10万。
    我国医学工作者通过对白血病前期血象征的长期观察研究，建立了白血病前期的可靠诊断标准，为白血病的癌前预防治疗创造了条件。利用我国设计的食管拉网细胞学技术普查食管癌，应用我国建立的简易敏感的免疫酶标等技术普查鼻咽癌，阳性率均在90％以上，普查发现的早期病人的比例在70％以上。
    癌症早期诊断技术的进步为确定高危人群，阻断癌变、早期预防和治疗奠定了基础。据介绍，现在我国各种癌症的治疗水平都比以前有了较大幅度提高，其中最难治愈的肝癌，早期病人手术后五年生存率已接近75％。
