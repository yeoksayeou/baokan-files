The National Conference of Organization Department Directors was held in Beijing on August 18th. The five-day meeting was brief, but the reporter felt a refreshing breeze of integrity everywhere.

First, let's talk about transportation. More than 180 representatives, many of whom are deputy secretaries or standing committee members of provincial, autonomous region, and municipal party committees, made the logistics of this meeting a significant challenge. In the past, such meetings would require renting cars from taxi companies, especially for large gatherings. A lead police car would be followed by a fleet of ten or more large and small cars, creating quite an impressive scene. However, during this meeting, the two large gatherings were held in a nearby guesthouse. Representatives walked in groups of two or three for a few hundred meters, reaching the venue in just a few minutes.

Next, let's discuss dining. The conference strictly followed relevant regulations for meal arrangements, and the guesthouse did not provide any additional subsidies. On the dining table, in addition to staple foods, soup, and a few small dishes, each person had a rectangular metal tray in front of them, divided into three sections for different types of dishes—meat, vegetables, and others. Each person had their own portion.

As for entertainment activities, the conference did not arrange any. Every evening after dinner, representatives either took a stroll and chatted in the guesthouse courtyard, studied documents and pondered issues in their rooms, or discussed relevant business matters with colleagues from various departments of the Central Organization Department. Few people went out for activities.

A relevant official from the Central Organization Department told the reporter that this time, there were fewer cars, but transportation was not tight; serving individual meals did not raise any objections from the representatives; and not arranging activities unrelated to the conference did not elicit any complaints.

    廉洁新风扑面来
    ——全国组织部长会议掠影
    本报记者  宋世琦
    8月18日，全国组织部长会议在北京召开。5天会期很短，记者却处处感到一股廉洁清新的会风。
    先说乘车。180多名代表，其中不少是省、自治区、直辖市党委的副书记或常委，会议用车是个大问题。安排这种会议，过去总要从出租汽车公司租车备用，特别是召开大会，前面一辆开路警车，后面紧随十几辆大小轿车组成的车队，很有点“气派”。而这次会议期间的两次大会，安排在不远的一家招待所内，代表三三两两步行几百米，几分钟就到了会场。
    再说吃饭。会议严格按照有关规定安排伙食，招待所不再补贴一分钱。餐桌上，除主食、汤和几盘小菜，每人面前各有一长方形金属盘子，分盛荤素不同三种菜，各人吃自己的一份。
    至于文娱活动，会议一次也没有安排。每天晚饭后，代表或在招待所院内散步、交谈，或在住房里学习文件，思考问题，有的则找中组部某些局、室的同志研究有关业务工作，很少有人外出活动。
    中组部有关同志对记者说，这次会车子少，但用车不紧张；吃分餐，代表没意见；不安排与会议无关的活动，也没有听到什么反映。
