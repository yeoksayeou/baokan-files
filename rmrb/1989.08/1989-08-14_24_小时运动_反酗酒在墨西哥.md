The "24-Hour Movement" – Fighting Alcoholism in Mexico

    By Guo Weicheng, Correspondent

    On July 19, the 14th anniversary of Mexico's "24-Hour Anti-Alcoholism Movement," tens of thousands of activists launched a massive propaganda campaign nationwide, calling on people to give up drinking for the sake of their health. Posters with the message "You are not alone! You are with the 24-Hour Anti-Alcoholism Movement" were posted at the entrances of laundries, bars, supermarkets, theaters, restaurants, hotels, and other public places.

    At the activity center of the "24-Hour Movement," the reporter met 45-year-old Rafael. He has not touched a drop of alcohol in the six years since he quit drinking and has become an active member of the "24-Hour Movement." He said, "The old Rafael died six years ago. It was the 24-Hour Movement that gave me a second life. Otherwise, I wouldn't be standing here today."

    The young man Vercelo, who was with him, confirmed this. Five years ago, Vercelo lost his job and family due to uncontrolled drinking. The partners of the "24-Hour Movement" reached out to him, helping him overcome his alcohol addiction. Now, he works for an insurance company. They often come to the activity center in their spare time to explain and promote the movement to others who need help quitting alcohol.

    I visited their alcohol rehabilitation club. At that time, there were still more than 20 people living there, both men and women, some of whom were alcoholics the day before. A person who does not want to drink but is unable to do so on their own can call any "24-Hour Movement" phone number, and volunteers will immediately arrive to take them to the rehabilitation club. The alcohol rehabilitation volunteers will lecture the person brought in about the harms of alcoholism and methods of quitting. These volunteers are all "reformed" alcoholics who use their own experiences to persuade others to quit drinking. At the same time, the club provides coffee and tea free of charge to alcoholics as substitutes for alcoholic beverages. If they wish, they can stay, eat, and live for free, with the condition that they do not drink alcohol and assist the club with cleaning and reception work every day. I saw their temporary dormitories, with 8 to 10 people per room, all double beds, very clean. From the statistics on the wall of the club, it can be seen that the center on Samora Street has already received tens of thousands of alcoholics seeking help.

    All volunteers at the center work without pay, purely out of a sense of social responsibility. The "24-Hour Movement" has 30,000 volunteers in 17 states (provinces) nationwide, divided into 96 groups, each with alcohol rehabilitation clubs of varying sizes. Additionally, they have established 10 farms specifically for those who have lost their jobs and families due to alcoholism. Over the past 14 years, the "24-Hour Movement" has helped 150,000 people quit drinking. All active members and volunteers have gained new life through the anti-alcohol movement. It is worth mentioning that this "24-Hour Movement" was started 14 years ago by 5 alcoholics.

    Mexico is a country with a drinking tradition. According to Mexican authorities, the country adds 1.7 million new drinkers each year. Due to alcoholism, the country loses 160,000 work hours annually; 36% of criminal cases and 57% of suicides are related to alcoholism, and a significant number of traffic accidents are caused by alcoholism; 15% of child abuse cases are due to parents' excessive drinking. Therefore, the government stipulates that restaurants serving alcoholic beverages must obtain special permits, and all alcohol advertisements and labels on bottles must state "Excessive drinking is harmful to health."

    The founder of the "24-Hour Movement," Vergilio, said, "I began to reflect seriously after long-term alcohol poisoning. This movement has no government or external funding; it relies entirely on the generous donations of its active members to support the '24-Hour Movement,' aiming to share a healthy life with all of society."

### “24小时运动”——反酗酒在墨西哥

    “24小时运动”
    ——反酗酒在墨西哥
    本报记者　郭伟成
    7月19日，是墨西哥“24小时反酗酒运动”14周年。成千上万的积极分子在全国展开了一次强大的宣传攻势，号召人们为了健康放弃酗酒。洗染店、酒吧、超级市场、影剧院、饭店、旅馆等公共场所的入口处都贴上了宣传画：“你并不孤立！你和24小时反酗酒运动在一起。”
    在“24小时运动”的活动中心，记者访问了45岁的拉法埃尔。他6年前戒酒以来滴酒不沾，成为“24小时运动”的积极分子。他说：“过去的拉法埃尔6年前已经死去。是24小时运动给了我第二次生命。不然，今天我就不会站在这儿了。”
    和他在一起的年青人维尔塞洛证实了这一点。5年前，维尔塞洛由于无节制地酗酒，失去了工作职位，失去了家庭。“24小时运动”的伙伴们向他伸出了温暖的手，帮助他戒除了酒瘾。现在，他是一家保险公司的职员。他们经常在业余时间到活动中心来，向其它需要戒酒的人进行宣传解释工作。
    我参观了他们的戒酒俱乐部。当时，还有20多人住在那儿，有男有女，有的人昨天还是酒鬼。一个不想酗酒、自己又无能为力的人可以拨通任何一个“24小时运动”的电话，于是，马上就有志愿人员赶到，把他接到戒酒俱乐部。戒酒志愿人员会向接来的人宣讲酗酒的害处及戒酒的方法。这些志愿人员都是“改邪归正”的酒鬼，多用自己的经验说服别人戒酒。同时，俱乐部向酗酒者免费提供咖啡与茶水等饮料代替酒类。愿意的话，可以留下来，吃、住免费，条件是不饮酒，每天协助俱乐部做清洁与接待工作。我看了他们的临时宿舍，8到10人一间，一色的双人床，十分整洁。从俱乐部墙上的统计表可以看出，位于萨莫拉街的这个中心站，已经接待过成千上万前来寻求帮助的酗酒者。
    中心的所有志愿人员都是不取报酬的，完全是在尽社会义务。“24小时运动”在全国17个州（省）拥有3万志愿人员，分属96个小组，每个小组都设立规模不等的戒酒俱乐部。另外，还开办了10个农场，专门接待因酗酒而失去工作与家庭的人。14年来，“24小时运动”已经帮助15万人戒除了酒瘾。所有积极分子、志愿人员，都是从戒酒运动中获得新生的。值得一提的是，这个“24小时运动”恰恰是由5名酒鬼在14年前开创的。
    墨西哥是一个有饮酒传统的国家。据墨西哥当局统计，全国每年新增加170万饮酒的人。由于酗酒，全国每年要损失16万个工作小时；36％的刑事犯罪与57％的自杀案件与酗酒有关，相当多的车祸是酗酒造成的；15％的儿童受虐待起因于父母的过量饮酒。因此，政府规定，供应含酒精饮料的饭店必须领取专门的许可证，所有酒类广告及酒瓶上的商标必须注明“过量饮酒有害健康”。
    “24小时运动”的创始人维尔希略说：“我是在长期酒精中毒中开始了认真的反思。这个运动没有政府与外来的资助，全靠它的积极分子慷慨解囊，捐助‘24小时运动’，为的是同全社会的人一起共享健康的生命。”
