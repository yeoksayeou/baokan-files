People's Daily, Berlin, August 17th. Correspondent Xu Hongzhi reports:

East Germany's Foreign Ministry's West German Section Deputy Director Schindler on the 16th summoned the Head of the West German Permanent Mission, Betzler, to protest against the West German Embassy in Hungary's actions that violate international law towards East German citizens.

In recent times, a small number of East German citizens have attempted to use illegal means to travel to West Germany and West Berlin, drawing public attention. Since Hungary opened its borders, a small number of East German citizens have used the opportunity of traveling to Hungary to cross the Hungarian-Austrian border and then travel to West Germany via Austria. Recently, 180 East German citizens entered the West German Embassy in Hungary and refused to leave, demanding that the embassy help them travel to West Germany.

At the same time, in Berlin, 131 East German citizens entered the West German Permanent Mission.

Schindler pointed out that the actions of the West German Embassy in Hungary are inconsistent with the normal relationship between East and West Germany as stipulated by the treaty. The basic treaty regarding relations between the two Germanys stipulates that neither party can represent the other internationally, and neither party can act on behalf of the other. He emphasized that the West German diplomatic mission has no right to provide so-called protection to East German citizens. West Germany should immediately stop such actions.

    西德外交机构为民德公民提供保护
    民德抗议西德违反国际法
    本报柏林8月17日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国外交部西德司代司长申德勒16日约见西德常驻代表处主任贝特勒，就西德驻匈牙利大使馆对民德公民采取违背国际法的做法提出抗议。
    一段时期以来，极少数民德公民企图采取非法手段前往西德和西柏林的事件时有发生，引起了人们的关注。自从匈牙利开放边界以后，极少数民德公民借到匈旅游之机，越过匈奥边界，然后从奥地利辗转前往西德。近日，有180名民德公民进入西德驻匈牙利大使馆，并滞留馆内不走，要求西德使馆帮助他们前往西德。
    与此同时，在柏林也有131名民德公民进入西德常驻代表处。
    申德勒指出，西德驻匈使馆的行为同民德与西德按条约规定的正常关系不相一致。有关两德关系的基础条约规定，两国中任何一方都不能在国际上代表另一方，任何一方都不能以另一方的名义采取行动。他强调，西德外交常驻机构无权对民德公民实行所谓保护。西德应立即停止类似做法。
