Title: Literature's Intuition and Rationality

Emphasizing the sensory qualities of literature has been a focus of some recent creative works and theoretical critiques. As a reaction against past "political literature" and "purely speculative literature," this is certainly necessary. However, if the sensory characteristics of literature are overemphasized to an inappropriate degree, it leads to a one-sided tendency to rely on intuition in creation and to exclude the role of rationality in literary creation, which is somewhat concerning.

Intuition is the most basic and simplest form of sensory cognition. Zhu Guangqian says: "Intuition is the starting point of cognition, the lowest stage of sensory cognition, limited to recognizing the images of individual objects. It does not make affirmative or negative judgments about these images, and these images are isolated, not related to any other objects, so they are meaningless." (Western Aesthetics, p. 632) Due to the lack of rational observation and control, the intuitive images in the literary entity, which are at the "lowest stage of sensory cognition," often lack thought content and emotional factors. Images that lack thought content and emotional factors also lack aesthetic value.

Under certain conditions, intuition can also carry emotional factors and create some aesthetically pleasing images. However, intuitive images have the characteristic of being "not related to any other objects," and if there is no rational consciousness to organize the images (images) into a logical framework, the cognition conveyed by these images is isolated, individual, and incomplete. Although these images have a certain aesthetic function, they only provide a low-level aesthetic pleasure. As an aesthetic reception in the sense of aesthetics, this is far from sufficient. Some current "intuitive literature" works are clear and complete or aesthetically pleasing in individual images, but as a whole, they are obscure, chaotic, fragmented, and incomplete. The images (images) are like scattered pearls, isolated, fragmented, and disorderly, unable to evoke deep aesthetic pleasure in the recipient, and it is difficult to have a good reading reception response. Because the subject tries to exclude rational thinking in the creation process to express intuition, the result is that only the surface impressions of life are written. This greatly weakens the basic function of literature to represent and influence society and life. The potential crisis within this, if allowed to develop, will inevitably lead to creation becoming a mere play on words. These phenomena, from the reverse side, show us: rationality is the pillar of the work, the light of literature. Excluding rationality in creation will only lead to the shallowness, decline, and deviation of literature; raising the banner of rational spirit, "gaining value and light from rationality," (Boileau, On the Art of Poetry) is the necessary path for literature to escape mediocrity and shallowness and achieve sublimity and profundity.

The rational consciousness of literature does not contradict its sensory characteristics; literature with a sublime rational spirit can also be literature with vivid sensory images. The reverse is also true. Therefore, literature gaining a rational spirit does not mean sacrificing its sensory qualities. Pointing out the importance of rationality in creative practice does not mean denying the position of artistic intuition in creation, nor does it mean advocating a "rational literature," nor is it to make literature take the old path of being a political appendage. Discussing this topic is just to say that in literary creation, relying solely on "writing intuition" is far from enough. The sensory characteristics and rational spirit of literature should and can be organically combined. The literary masterpieces in Chinese and foreign history, the works that people generally recognize as good, are all products of the harmonious unity of the two. Artificially opposing the two, emphasizing one and belittling the other, are both one-sided.

    文学的直觉与理性
    王浩洪
    张扬文学的感性特质，是近些年来一些创作和理论批评颇感兴趣的工作。作为对过去的“政治文学”、“纯思辨文学”的反拨，这当然很有必要。但把文学的感性特点强调到不恰当的程度，也带来了靠直觉创作，排斥理性在文学创作中的地位的片面倾向，却不免令人忧虑。
    直觉是最基本最简单的感性认识。朱光潜说：“直觉是认识的起点，就是感性认识的最低阶段，还只限于认识个别事物的形象，对这形象不下肯否的判断，这形象还是孤立的，还不与任何其它事物发生关系，所以还是没有意义的。”（《西方美学史》第632页）由于缺乏理性的观照和把握，文学本体中这种处于“感性认识的最低阶段”的直觉形象，往往缺乏思想内涵和情感因素。而缺乏思想内涵和情感因素的形象同时也缺乏美感价值。
    在特定的条件下，直觉也有可能带上情感因素，创造出一些有美感的意象。然而，直觉形象具有“不与任何其它事物发生关系”的单一性，如果没有某种理性意识作为组织形象（意象）的逻辑经络，这些形象传达的认知就是孤立的、个别的、不完整的。虽然这些形象也有一定的美感功用，但那给予人的只是低层次的审美快感。作为美学意义上的文学接受，这是很不够的。当前有些“直觉文学”作品，在个别的意象上清晰完整或富有美感，但在整体上却是晦涩、颠倒、割裂、不完整的，形象（意象）如散落的珠贝，孤立零碎、杂乱无序，不能引起接受主体深层的审美愉悦，并且难有良好的阅读接受反应。由于主体在创作中力图排除理性思维去表现直觉，其结果，写出的只是生活的一些表层印象。如此大大削弱了文学表现和作用社会和人生的基本功能。个中潜伏的危机，发展下去，难免不使创作成为文字噱头。这些现象从反面向我们显示：理性是作品的支柱，文学的烛光。在创作中排斥理性只会导致文学的浅薄、衰微和步入歧途；扬起理性精神的旗帜，“从理性获得价值和光芒”，（布瓦罗《论诗艺》）是文学摆脱平庸浮浅达到崇高深刻的必由之路。
    文学的理性意识与感性特点并不互相排斥，具有崇高理性精神的文学同时也能够是有鲜明感性形象的文学。反之亦然。因此，文学获得理性精神，并非要以失落其感性特质为代价，指出创作实践中理性的重要，也不意味着否认艺术直觉在创作中的地位，抑或是要标榜一种“理性文学”，更不是要文学走“政治附庸”的老路。议论这样一个题目，只是想说，在文学创作中，仅仅“写直觉”是非常不够的，文学的感性特点与理性精神应该而且可以有机地结合。中外历史上的文学佳构，人们公认的好作品，都是两者和谐统一的产物。把两者人为地对立起来，张扬前者贬抑后者或张扬后者贬抑前者，都失之偏颇。
