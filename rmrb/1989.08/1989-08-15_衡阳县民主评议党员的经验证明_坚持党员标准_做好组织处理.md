Since the end of last year, the county committee's organization department in Hengyang County has conducted a democratic evaluation of party members in over 1,610 branches involving 30,322 party members. Through this evaluation, 910 unqualified party members have been subjected to various disciplinary actions, including warnings, party expulsions, and expulsions from the party. Why were these party members subjected to such disciplinary actions?

Some 87 party members had their desires inflated and violated party discipline and state laws. Among them, some used their power for personal gain, engaged in illegal trading, and harmed the interests of the party and the state; some engaged in bribery and embezzlement, causing economic losses to enterprises; some did not seriously implement the party's policies and guidelines, creating a bad influence among the people; and some were morally corrupt and degenerate. Although the number of these party members is small, their behavior has damaged the party's image.

A total of 301 party members had weak organizational awareness and lax discipline, failing to attend organizational activities on time and failing to pay party dues on time. This group accounts for 33% of the disciplined party members.

A total of 340 party members had weakened revolutionary will and had not played an active role for a long time. This group accounts for 36.8% of the disciplined party members. After joining the party, they relaxed their self-discipline, mistakenly believing that as long as they did not make serious mistakes, they would not be expelled from the party for life.

Some party members did not originally meet the qualifications for party membership and were hastily recruited during the "Cultural Revolution." Some units hastily recruited party members, lowering the quality of party members.

Some grassroots units' party organizations failed to educate and manage party members effectively. Some party branches did not address the shortcomings and errors of party members, allowing them to develop unchecked; some did not provide timely criticism and education, failing to resolve issues that could have been addressed, thereby inadvertently fostering a bad atmosphere among some party members.

    衡阳县民主评议党员的经验证明——
    坚持党员标准　做好组织处理
    去年底以来，我县县委组织部在全县1610多个支部30322名党员中，开展了民主评议党员活动。经过评议，先后有910名不合格党员分别受到限期改正、党内劝退、党内除名等处置。这些党员为何受到如此处置呢？
    私欲膨胀，违犯党纪国法，这部分党员有87名。他们中有的以权谋私，倒买倒卖，损害党和国家的利益；有的搞行贿受贿，中饱私囊，给企业造成经济损失；有的不认真执行党的方针政策，在群众中造成很坏的影响；还有的人道德败坏，腐化堕落。这些党员数量虽不多，但他们的行为损害了党的形象。
    组织观念淡薄，纪律松弛，不按时参加组织生活，不按时缴纳党费。这部分党员共有301人，占受处分党员总数的33％。
    革命意志衰退，长期不发挥作用。这部分党员占受处分党员总数的36.8％。他们入党后，放松了对自己的要求，错误地认为，只要不犯严重错误，一辈子也出不了党。
    本来不具备党员条件，草率发展入党的。这些党员中，有相当一部分人是在“文革”期间入党的。有的单位草率发展党员，降低了党员的质量。
    个别基层单位党组织对党员的教育、管理不力。有的党支部对党员的缺点、错误不管不问，任其发展；有的批评教育不及时，使一些本来可以得到解决的问题没有及时得到解决，客观上助长了个别党员不良风气的滋长。
