Edition: 5

The 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. Over the past 40 years, the republic's socialist construction on all fronts has achieved great success.

The article "The Rise of the Eastern Giant" reflects the glorious achievements of the economic front over the past 40 years from various aspects. It fully proves the truth that "only socialism can save China" and "only socialism can develop China," inspiring the people of the entire nation to invest even more enthusiasm in the cause of socialist construction and reform and opening up.

At the same time, the report also reminds people to calmly face the reality of the national situation. China is still in the primary stage of socialism, and social productivity is still very low. The annual increase in national income is not much. Therefore, it is necessary for people to work even harder to build a socialist motherland and strive for greater victories.

The great People's Republic of China is about to celebrate its 40th birthday.

Reading the soon-to-be-published book "Four Decades of Struggle," I feel a deep sense of joy and pride. With dozens of color photographs, hundreds of charts, and a large amount of data and textual narrative, it faithfully depicts and showcases the journey and great achievements of the People's Republic of China since its birth, inspiring people to strive forward. With abundant historical materials and irrefutable facts, it fully proves the truth that "only socialism can save China" and "without the Communist Party, there would be no new China."

Those who have experienced the old China still vividly remember the desolate and miserable scenes of economic stagnation, poverty, and destruction across the land.

The 40-year journey of the People's Republic, though filled with twists and turns, has seen significant progress in social development and a tremendous increase in economic strength. Especially in the past decade, under the guidance of reform and opening up, the motherland's ship has forged ahead on the socialist course, creating brilliant achievements that have attracted global attention.

Now, let us take a look at the new steps taken by the Eastern Giant from the materials provided in this book.

Construction on a Grand Scale and Remarkable Achievements

After three years of recovery, New China immediately launched a large-scale economic construction plan.

From 1950 to 1988, the cumulative total investment in state-owned fixed assets was 2,153.8 billion yuan, of which 1,488 billion yuan was for basic construction. A total of 4,393 large and medium-sized key projects were completed and put into operation, adding 1,561.9 billion yuan in fixed assets.

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Persistent efforts have been made in water conservancy projects and river management. By the end of 1988, a total of 170,000 kilometers of dikes had been built, 80,000 reservoirs had been constructed, and the effective irrigated area had reached 44 million hectares. Agricultural machinery has developed from nonexistent to a total power of 265.8 billion watts.

Compared to 1949, the original value of industrial fixed assets in 1988 had increased by 50 times. The new production capacity includes: 550 million tons of raw coal, 100 million kilowatts of installed power generation capacity, 220 million tons of crude oil, 170 million tons of iron ore, 36.97 million tons of steel... New industries such as automobiles, aircraft, electronics, aerospace, and nuclear industry have been established. An independent and relatively complete industrial system has been formed in China.

The scale of transportation construction is impressive. Newly built railway operating mileage is 28,000 kilometers, and electrified mileage is 6,000 kilometers. The total railway operating mileage has increased from 21,800 kilometers at the beginning of the founding of the nation to 52,800 kilometers in 1988. Now, except for Tibet, all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities have railway access.

The total length of highways has increased from 126,700 kilometers in 1952 to 999,600 kilometers in 1988, an increase of more than 11 times compared to 1949. All 1,936 counties in the country, except for Medog County in Tibet, have road access.

Civil aviation has opened 350 domestic and international routes, with operating mileage increasing from 13,100 kilometers in 1952 to 373,800 kilometers, forming a comprehensive air transportation network.

The length of postal routes has increased from 705,000 kilometers at the beginning of the founding of the nation to 5 million kilometers in 1988. The number of urban telephones increased from 295,000 in 1952 to 3.623 million in 1988. Long-distance telephone calls increased even faster, from 16.28 million in 1952 to 6.4 billion in 1988. Many major cities can now directly dial overseas and Hong Kong and Macao regions.

Increased Economic Strength: A New Era

Massive investments have yielded bountiful results.

From 1953 to 1988, the national gross product and national income increased by an average of 7.1% and 6.7% per year, respectively. If 1952 is taken as the base year (100), the national gross product and national income in 1988 were 1,168.2 and 1,095.1, respectively, an increase of 10 and 9 times. National fiscal revenue increased from 18.37 billion yuan in 1952 to 258.78 billion yuan in 1988.

These achievements mainly come from the sustained and stable development of industrial and agricultural production. Taking 1952 as the base year (100), the total agricultural output value in 1988 was 364.9, and the total industrial output value was 5,525.4.

The old China, known as an "agricultural country," had a maximum annual output of 150 million tons of grain and 849,000 tons of cotton. In 1988, the total grain output reached 394 million tons, and cotton output reached 4.149 million tons, an increase of 2.6 times and 4.9 times, respectively. The 40-year-old People's Republic has, through its own efforts, ensured the food and clothing needs of 1.1 billion people, basically solving the problem of subsistence.

In the old China, since the establishment of modern industry, the maximum annual output of major industrial products in half a century was also meager. For example, yarn 445,000 tons, cloth 2.79 billion meters, steel 923,000 tons, raw coal 61.88 million tons, crude oil 320,000 tons, electricity 6 billion kilowatt-hours, metal-cutting machine tools 5,390 units. After 40 years of construction, the 1988 production of New China compared to the above, yarn increased by 9.5 times, cloth by 5.7 times, steel by 63 times, raw coal by 15 times, crude oil by 427 times, electricity by 90 times, and machine tools by 35 times.

Implementing Reform and Opening Up: Adding Wings to the Tiger

The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the strengthening of national economic strength are inseparable from the implementation of reform and opening up. In the 10 years of reform and opening up, China's economic and social development have undergone profound changes, ushering in a new chapter.

A multi-ownership structure with public ownership as the mainstay has replaced the single public ownership economy. The highly centralized product economy is gradually transitioning to a new socialist planned commodity economy that combines planning and market regulation. This has brought great vitality to the liberation of social productivity and the development of the entire national economy. Therefore, these 10 years are the most vigorous period of economic development, the fastest period of national strength growth, and the period when the people have benefited the most.

In these 10 years (1978-1988), the national gross product increased by an average of 9.6% per year, 3.5 percentage points higher than the average annual growth of 6.1% in the previous 26 years (1952-1977).

Agricultural economic development has made breakthrough progress. The total agricultural output value increased by an average of 6.2% per year, exceeding the average annual growth rate of 2.7% in the previous 26 years. In 1988, the total non-agricultural output value reached 666.9 billion yuan, an increase of 7 times compared to 1978.

The total industrial output value increased by an average of 12.8% per year, exceeding the average annual growth rate of 11.4% in the previous 26 years, and the production technology level has been significantly improved. More than 10,000 items of advanced foreign technology and equipment have been introduced, and a batch of modernized new products have been produced.

In these 10 years, the total import and export trade volume was equivalent to 1/4 of the national gross product. In 1988, it exceeded the "100 billion mark" reaching 102.79 billion US dollars, an increase of 4 times compared to 1978, with an average annual growth rate of 17.4%, exceeding the average annual growth rate of 10.9% in the previous 26 years.

During these 10 years, while introducing and absorbing advanced foreign technology and management experience, the actual utilization of foreign capital increased from 1.98 billion US dollars in 1983 to 10.23 billion US dollars in 1988. Tourism foreign exchange earnings also increased from 620 million US dollars in 1980 to 2.25 billion US dollars in 1988.

Improving People's Lives: Unity Among All Ethnic Groups

On the basis of developing production, gradually improving people's lives is a consistent proposition of the Communist Party of China. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the past 10 years, the per capita income and actual consumption level of residents across the country have significantly improved.

In 1988, the per capita net income in rural areas was 545 yuan, excluding the factor of price increases, it increased by 2.1 times compared to 134 yuan in 1978, with an average annual increase of 11.8%. The per capita living expenses income in urban areas was 1,119 yuan, excluding the factor of price increases, it increased by 87.6% compared to 316 yuan in 1978, with an average annual increase of 6.5%.

The actual consumption level of residents nationwide was 76 yuan per person per year in 1952 and 639 yuan per person per year in 1988, excluding the factor of price increases, with an average annual increase of 3.7%. Among them, from 1979 to 1988, the average annual increase was 7.6%.

The per capita living area has increased several times. In urban areas, it increased from 4.2 square meters in 1978 to 8.8 square meters in 1988; in rural areas, it increased from 8.1 square meters in 1978 to 16.6 square meters in 1988.

Residents' savings have increased even more. The end-of-year balance of urban and rural residents' savings was 860 million yuan in 1952, while it increased to 380.2 billion yuan by the end of 1988.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the economy of ethnic minority areas across the country has developed rapidly, and people's lives have correspondingly improved. From 1950 to 1988, the total investment in basic construction in ethnic minority areas nationwide reached 141.69 billion yuan. The total industrial and agricultural output value increased at an annual rate of 8%, reaching 108.09 billion yuan in 1988. Transportation conditions have improved, and the historical phenomenon of economic development inequality among various ethnic groups has been changed.

"Rich Information: Basis for Decision-Making"

When we see the glorious achievements of the past 40 years with joy, we should also calmly face the reality of the national situation.

Although the national gross product in 1987 was approximately double that of 1980, achieving the first doubling target three years ahead of schedule, the task of achieving the second doubling in the next 11 years and reaching a moderately prosperous level of living for the people is arduous and requires the people to redouble their efforts.

China is still in the primary stage of socialism. Per capita resources are relatively scarce, with arable land area equivalent to 30% of the world average, forest area equivalent to 13% of the world average, annual water resources runoff equivalent to 1/4 of the world average, and many mineral resources, although the total amount ranks among the world's top, the per capita reserves are still far below the world average. Social productivity is still low, and the annual increase in national income is not much. While the annual increase in population reaches 15 million, most of the increased national income is used for the consumption of the increased population and the improvement of the living standards of the existing population, leaving only 2-3 billion yuan for investment to expand reproduction.

The book "Four Decades of Struggle" collects rich data from various regions and industries across the country. These scientific data are both information and the basis for decision-making. As Premier Li Peng wrote in his inscription for the book: "Rich information, basis for decision-making."

    ——编者
    伟大的中华人民共和国40周岁生日即将来临。
    读了即将出版发行的《奋进的四十年》一书，深感欣喜和自豪。它以几十幅彩照、几百张图表特别是大量数据与文字叙述，忠实写照和展示了中华人民共和国诞生以来的历程和巨大成就，催人振奋。它以翔实的史料，雄辩的事实，充分证明“只有社会主义能够救中国”，“没有共产党，就没有新中国”的真理。
    从旧中国走过来的老人们，对神州大地那时经济萧条、民不聊生、满目疮痍的凄惨景象，至今历历在目，记忆犹新。
    人民共和国40年的历程尽管充满坎坷曲折，然而社会发展有了长足进步，经济实力获得巨大增长。尤其近10年来，在改革开放罗盘指引下，祖国巨轮在社会主义航道上破浪奋进，创造了举世瞩目的灿烂成就。
    现在就让我们从这本书提供的材料中，看看东方巨人迈出的新脚步吧。
    建设规模宏大　成就卓著
    新中国经过3年恢复时期后，立即有计划地展开了规模巨大的经济建设。
    自1950年至1988年，全民所有制固定资产投资总额累计21538亿元，其中基本建设投资14880亿元。先后有4393个大中型骨干项目竣工投产，新增固定资产15619亿元。
    农业是国民经济的基础。兴修水利，治理江河，坚持不懈。到1988年底，全国累计新修堤防17万公里，兴建水库8万多座，有效灌溉面积达4400多万公顷。农业机械从无到有，总动力已拥有2658亿瓦特。
    1988年与1949年相比，工业固定资产原值增长了50倍。新增生产能力择其要者：原煤开采5.5亿多吨，发电装机容量1亿多千瓦，原油开采2.2亿多吨，铁矿开采1.7亿多吨，炼钢3697万吨……还建立了汽车、飞机、电子、航天、核工业等新兴工业部门。独立而门类比较齐全的工业体系，已在我国形成。
    交通运输建设规模可观。新建铁路交付运营里程2.8万公里，电气里程0.6万公里。铁路运营总里程由建国初期的2.18万公里增加到1988年的5.28万公里。现在，除西藏外，各省（区）市都通了火车。
    公路通车里程由1952年的12.67万公里增加到1988年的99.96万公里，比1949年增长11倍多。全国1936个县除西藏墨脱1县之外，县县通了汽车。
    民用航空已开通350条国内国际航线，运营里程由1952年的1.31万公里增加到37.38万公里，构成了四通八达的蓝天运输网络。
    邮路长度由建国初期的70.5万公里，增加到1988年的500万公里。市内电话1952年还只有29.5万户，1988年已增加到362.3万户。长途电话增加更快，由1952年的1628万张增至1988年的6.4亿多张，许多大城市已能直拨国外和港澳地区。
    经济实力增强　今非昔比
    巨大投入，产出累累硕果。
    从1953年到1988年，国民生产总值和国民收入平均每年增长7.1％和6.7％。如以1952年为基数100，1988年的国民生产总值和国民收入则为1168.2和1095.1，分别增长10倍、9倍多。国家财政收入也由1952年的183.7亿元，增加到1988年的2587.8亿元。
    这些成果主要来自工农业生产的持续稳定发展。仍以1952年为基数100，1988年农业总产值为364.9，工业总产值为5525.4。
    号称“农业立国”的旧中国，主要农产品最高年产量粮食1.5亿吨、棉花84.9万吨，而1988年粮食总产量达3.94亿吨、棉花414.9万吨，分别增长2.6倍和4.9倍。不惑之年的人民共和国，就是依靠自己的力量，保证了11亿人民的吃、穿需要，基本解决了温饱问题。
    旧中国自创办现代工业起，在半个世纪里，主要工业品的最高年产量也是少得可怜。例如，纱44.5万吨，布27.9亿米，钢92.3万吨，原煤6188万吨，原油32万吨，发电量60亿千瓦时，金属切削机床5390台。新中国经过40年的建设，以1988年的产量与之相比，纱增长9.5倍，布增长5.7倍，钢增长63倍，原煤增长15倍，原油增长427倍，电增长90倍，机床增长35倍。
    实行改革开放　如虎添翼
    工农业生产发展之迅速，国家经济实力之增强，是同实行改革开放分不开的。改革开放10年，使我国经济和社会发展面貌发生深刻变化，揭开了新的篇章。
    以公有制为主体的多种所有制结构替代了单一的公有制经济。高度集中的产品经济逐渐向计划经济和市场调节相结合新的社会主义有计划的商品经济转换。这给社会生产力的解放，整个国民经济的发展，带来了勃勃生机。因此，这10年是我国经济发展最旺盛，国力增长最快，人民得实惠最多的时期。
    这10年（1978至1988，下同），国民生产总值平均每年增长9.6％，比前26年（1952至1977，下同）年增长6.1％，高出3.5个百分点。
    农村经济具有突破性进展。农业总产值平均每年增长6.2％，超过前26年年增长2.7％的速度。1988年非农业总产值达到6669亿元，比1978年增长了7倍。
    工业总产值平均每年增长12.8％，超过前26年年增长11.4％的速度，而且生产技术水平获得显著提高。引进国外先进技术、设备1万余项，开始生产出了一批具有现代化水平的新产品。
    这10年，进出口贸易总额相当国民生产总值的1／4。1988年突破“千亿大关”达到1027.9亿美元，比1978年增长了4倍，平均每年增长17.4％，超过前26年年增长10.9％的速度。
    在这10年中间，我们在引进吸收国外先进技术和管理经验的同时，实际利用外资由1983年的19.8亿美元，增加到1988年的102.3亿美元。旅游收汇也由1980年的6.2亿美元，增加到1988年的22.5亿美元。
    人民生活改善　各族团结
    在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善人民生活，是中国共产党的一贯主张。建国40年特别是近10年来，全国人均收入和居民实际消费水平，有了显著提高。
    1988年，农村人均纯收入545元，扣除物价上涨因素，比1978年的134元增长2.1倍，平均每年提高11.8％。城镇人均用于生活费用收入1119元，扣除物价上涨因素，比1978年的316元增长87.6％，平均每年提高6.5％。
    全国居民实际消费水平1952年为每人每年76元，1988年每人每年639元，扣除物价上涨因素，平均每年增长3.7％。其中，1979年至1988年，每年增长7.6％。
    人均居住面积成倍增加。城镇由1978年的4.2平方米，增加到1988年的8.8平方米；农村则由1978年的8.1平方米，增加到1988年的16.6平方米。
    居民储蓄增加更多。1952年城乡居民储蓄年底余额为8.6亿元，而1988年末则上升为3802亿元。
    特别需要提到的是，全国少数民族地区经济获得了较快的发展，人民生活相应有所改善。从1950年到1988年，全国少数民族地区的基本建设投资总额达1416.9亿元。工农业总产值以每年8％的速度递增，1988年达到1080.9亿元。交通运输条件有了改善，历史上遗留下来的各民族之间在经济上的发展不平等现象已获改变。
    “丰富的信息　决策的依据”
    当我们看到40年的光辉成就欣喜之余，也还应当冷静地面对现实国情。
    尽管全国国民生产总值1987年比1980年增长约1倍，提前3年实现了第一个翻番目标，而在今后11年里实现第二个翻一番、人民生活达到小康水平，任务艰巨，尚需国人加倍努力。
    我国仍然处在社会主义初级阶段。人均资源比较贫乏，耕地面积相当于世界平均水平的30％，森林面积只相当于世界平均水平的13％，水资源年径流量相当于世界平均水平的1／4，许多矿产资源储量虽然总量居世界前列而人均储量仍大大低于世界平均水平。社会生产力还很低，每年新增国民收入为数不多。而每年新增人口达1500万之多，新增国民收入绝大部分要用于新增人口的消费和现有人口的生活改善，剩下用于投资扩大再生产的仅二三百亿元。
    《奋进的四十年》一书收录了全国各地区、各产业的丰富数据。这些科学数据，既是信息，又是决策的依据。正如李鹏总理为本书题词所写的：“丰富的信息决策的依据”。
