Over the past few years, more than 1,400 officers from various levels of the Navy's offices above the regimental level have gone to the grassroots to take on temporary positions. This has helped to transform the style of work in the offices and strengthen grassroots construction.

Officers from the offices typically spend 3 to 6 months at the grassroots level, while young officers who have just graduated from academies and are assigned to the offices spend at least 1 year. They mostly go to ships and units with relatively harsh conditions to serve as commanders or in probationary positions. They live, eat, study, and work with grassroots officers and soldiers, undergoing comprehensive training. They have become familiar with the policies and requirements for grassroots construction and the traditions and experiences of managing troops. Officers from the Navy's headquarters who went to the grassroots conducted active investigations and research on political and ideological work, writing several good reports reflecting the situation of political and ideological education. Officers from the East Sea Fleet's aviation unit who went to the grassroots wrote more than 100 investigative reports on grassroots work.

After returning to the offices, the officers who went to the grassroots have a more in-depth style of work, are more enthusiastic about doing practical things for the grassroots, and have improved work efficiency.

    转变机关作风　加强基层建设
    海军千余干部下基层代职
    新华社北京8月4日电  （记者黄彩虹）海军团以上各级机关近年来有1400多名干部下基层代职锻炼，促进了机关作风的转变，加强了基层建设。
    机关干部下基层代职时间一般为3至6个月，直接由院校毕业分配到机关的年轻干部不少于1年。他们大多去条件比较艰苦的基层舰艇、连队担任主官或见习职务，与基层干部战士同吃、同住、同学习、同工作，经受全面锻炼，熟悉了基层建设的方针和要求，熟悉了带兵管理的传统和经验。海直机关下去的干部结合政治思想工作积极进行调查研究，写出了一些较好的政治思想教育情况反映和调查报告。东海舰队航空兵机关下放代职的干部撰写了100余篇基层工作调查报告。
    机关干部下放代职锻炼回机关后作风更深入了，为基层办实事更热心了，办事的效率也提高了。
