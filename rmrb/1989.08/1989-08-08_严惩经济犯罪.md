Reform and opening up is the path to national strength. The arduous journey of a decade of reform and the harsh realities of the present remind us that to ensure that reform and opening up proceed correctly and healthily, and to consolidate and develop the socialist economic foundation, we must insist on severely cracking down on economic crimes.

As a social crime phenomenon, economic crimes have never ceased in our country. However, since we implemented reform and opening up, these criminal activities, with their distinct characteristics of the times, have emerged with strong greed and great harm, and are becoming increasingly rampant. The main crimes are smuggling, bribery, speculation and fraud, and theft of state and collective property. Around 1982, the Party Central Committee, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council promptly took emergency measures, formulated and improved relevant laws and policies, and launched a nationwide campaign to severely punish serious economic crimes. This had a good impact on China's economic and political life after the reform and opening up. In recent years, economic criminals have become rampant again. From the situation reflected in various places, the main features of criminal activities are as follows:

First, bribery and embezzlement crimes are prominent. Cases under investigation account for more than half of the total number of economic crime cases, with a noticeable increase in major and important cases; the amount of crime has increased, with cases involving more than 10 million yuan being rare in the past, but now cases involving more than 100 million yuan frequently appear; the proportion of ongoing crimes in the past and this year has increased.

Second, fraud crimes are blatant. Criminals use fake contracts to defraud large amounts of prepaid loans; they use lost, voided, or stolen checks and altered reimbursement documents to defraud property.

Third, the subjects of the crimes are special. Crimes are concentrated in production and circulation sectors and management links, with an increase in crimes committed by financial system employees, party and government officials, enterprise managers, and cadres at the county and regimental levels and above.

Fourth, the locations of the crimes are special. Criminals are usually in important positions, using state and collective resources, relying on industry privileges, or taking advantage of the preferential policies of open cities and new development areas, to engage in criminal activities for personal gain.

Fifth, the methods of committing crimes are constantly changing, and the consequences are serious. Among the criminals, there is a serious problem of collusion between insiders and outsiders; the methods of committing crimes are more concealed and cunning; after committing crimes, they either flee with the money or spend it recklessly; their awareness of resisting investigation and prosecution is strengthened, and once their crimes are exposed, they seek help from others, fabricate lies and false documents, causing great difficulties for investigation and trial work.

Why have economic crimes become serious again in recent years? On one hand, with the development of commodity economy, commodities and money play an important role in social life, and coupled with our educational mistakes, some people with weak willpower have fallen prey to money and material things. On the other hand, the efforts to crack down and punish have been insufficient, with fines replacing criminal penalties, light sentences for serious crimes, unreported cases, and even the abnormal phenomenon of increasing crimes while reducing the number of cases filed.

Economic crimes are a reflection of social corruption. They corrupt the ranks of cadres, disrupt the Four Modernizations, and affect reform and opening up. For such criminal activities, we must ensure that every case is investigated and severely punished. For cases involving state organs, leading cadres, relatives of leading cadres, and those with tight networks, we must investigate thoroughly and absolutely not be lenient. We must persist in both promoting reform and opening up and cracking down on economic crimes throughout our work.

    严惩经济犯罪
    改革开放是强国之路。十年改革的艰难历程和当前严酷的现实告诫我们，要使改革开放沿着正确、健康的方向大步前进，巩固和发展社会主义的经济基础，必须坚持严厉打击经济犯罪。
    作为一种社会犯罪现象，经济犯罪活动在我国从来都没有停止过。但在我们实行改革开放以后，这种犯罪活动带着它明显的时代特征，以强烈的贪婪性和极大的危害性暴露出来，且愈演愈烈。其犯罪主要是走私贩私，贪污受贿，投机诈骗，盗窃国家和集体财产。1982年前后，党中央、全国人大常委会、国务院及时采取紧急措施，制订和完善了有关法律政策，在全国开展了严惩严重破坏经济犯罪的活动，对我国改革开放后的经济生活、政治生活产生了很好的影响。近年来，经济犯罪分子又猖獗起来，从各地反映的情况看，犯罪活动主要有以下新的特点：
    第一、贪污、受贿犯罪突出。立案侦查的案件占经济犯罪案件总数的一半以上，大案、要案上升明显；犯罪金额增大，过去10万元以上的案件甚为罕见，现在百万元以上的案件经常出现；去年和今年的现行作案比重加大。
    第二、诈骗犯罪明目张胆。犯罪分子一是利用假合同，诈骗巨额预付贷款；二是利用丢失、作废或盗窃来的支票和涂改报销单据诈骗财物。
    第三、犯罪主体特殊。发案比较集中在生产流通领域和管理流通环节的部门，金融系统的工作人员、党政机关的干部、企业的厂长经理、县团级以上的干部犯罪增多。
    第四、发案部位特殊。犯罪分子一般处在重要地位，或利用国家、集体资源，或依仗行业特权，或凭借开放城市和新开发地区的优惠政策，以权谋私，大肆进行犯罪活动。
    第五、作案手段不断变化，后果严重。犯罪分子中，内外勾结、共同作案严重；作案方式更加隐蔽诡密；作案后携款潜逃或急于挥霍；反侦查、反追究意识增强，罪行一旦败露，托人说情，编造谎言假证，给侦察、审判工作带来很大困难。
    为什么近年来经济犯罪又严重起来？一方面，随着商品经济的发展，商品、货币在社会生活中起着重要的作用，加上我们教育工作失误，致使一些意志薄弱的人败倒在金钱物质面前；另一方面，打击、处罚不力，以罚代刑、重罪轻判、有案不报，甚至出现了犯罪增多而立案减少的反常现象。
    经济犯罪是社会腐败现象的一种反映，它腐蚀了干部队伍，破坏了四化建设，影响了改革开放。对于这类犯罪活动，必须做到有案必查、严惩不贷，对涉及到国家机关、领导干部、领导干部亲属以及关系网严密的案件，一定要查个水落石出，绝不能姑息迁就。要把一手抓改革开放，一手抓打击经济犯罪贯穿到我们工作的始终。
