Shandong Yanzhou Mining Bureau's Xinglongzhuang Coal Mine is the first large-scale modern mine in China designed and built domestically with an annual production capacity of 300 million tons of raw coal. The main equipment in the production, transportation, and hoisting systems were imported from Japan, Britain, Austria, Sweden, and other countries. The mechanization rates for coal mining and tunneling are both 100%. Under the steel framework of the comprehensive mining support, facing the coal wall like a palace wall, workers who used to bend over in low coal mines, drill holes, blast coal, and shovel coal with large shovels, now only need to press a button and operate the handle to make the machinery roar, and the raw coal flows like a tide to the surface.

How does one carry forward the spirit of hard work in such a highly mechanized mine?

The leaders of Xinglongzhuang Mine believe that with the progress of society and the development of productive forces, the spirit of hard work is constantly being enriched and developed. Different periods and conditions have different focuses. Under highly mechanized conditions, the mine leadership pays attention to guiding workers to study modern production technology and management diligently, fully utilize the mechanical efficiency, and strive to achieve the best economic benefits.

Before Xinglongzhuang Mine went into production, the comprehensive mining equipment had been used in Shandong coal mines, but all had experienced problems of "neither the donkey walks nor the mill turns." The workers of Xinglongzhuang Mine, through technical training, quickly mastered the use of comprehensive coal mining equipment. Shortly after production began, the comprehensive mining team 1 broke through the provincial record of 10 million tons per month. Subsequently, the comprehensive mining team 2 set a new provincial record of 13.8 million tons per month. The comprehensive mining team 3 caught up and set a new national record of 14.7 million tons per month for the same type of equipment, maintaining the national advanced level of producing 100 million tons per year for three consecutive years.

Carrying forward the spirit of hard work means not spending money that shouldn't be spent and being willing to spend money that should be spent. Xinglongzhuang Coal Mine is a large enterprise, and the leadership carefully plans and does not waste the company's money.

At the time of the modern mine acceptance, someone suggested building high-standard meeting rooms and reception rooms with luxurious decorations. However, the mine leaders believed that the hallmark of a modern mine is the modernization of safety, production, efficiency, and management, not the modernization of the "three rooms" (office, meeting room, reception room). To this day, in the office building with the plaque "National Coal Industry First Batch of Modern Mines," the Party Committee's standing committee meeting room, administrative meeting room, and reception room have no luxurious decorations. White tablecloths cover the cracked wooden tables. The faded sofa covers wrap the simple sofas that have been repaired many times.

While practicing thrift, Xinglongzhuang Coal Mine dares to spend money on production and construction, using good steel on the blade. To quickly achieve the designed production capacity, the mine, through expert consultations, decisively invested 3.37 million yuan and signed a three-year agreement with relevant research institutions for 38 joint research projects in eight areas, including coal pillar-less mining, comprehensive fire prevention and extinguishing, comprehensive dust prevention, and mechanized rock tunnel excavation lines. The mine, relying on the strong technical strength of the research institutions, realized the technical matching of the mine and, in 1986, achieved the designed capacity of 300 million tons per year one year ahead of the national plan.

Carrying forward the spirit of hard work is not about letting people eat pickled vegetables and steamed buns, but about letting people live a happy life through hard work.

Xinglongzhuang Coal Mine, on the basis of improving the economic benefits of the enterprise, continuously improves the living standards of the workers. In 1982, the mine produced 120 million tons of coal, with an average income of 1,071 yuan per person; in 1986, when it reached the designed capacity of 300 million tons and paid 18.51 million yuan in profits, the average income reached 2,562 yuan per person; in 1988, when production increased to 340 million tons and 48.75 million yuan in profits were paid, the average income increased to 2,944 yuan.

The mine established a cultural palace, stadium, artificial lake, swimming pool, and mine park; enriched the workers' cultural and sports life; built underground single-person apartments, improved the workers' living conditions; and supported various business companies to operate chicken farms, pig farms, dairy farms, and vegetable bases, making life more convenient for the workers.

Hard work brings an improved living standard, and workers love their jobs even more and work even harder.

    艰苦奋斗精神在兴隆
    朱新春
    山东兖州矿务局兴隆庄煤矿是我国自行设计、自己建设的第一座年产原煤300万吨的特大型现代化矿井。生产、运输、提升系统中的主要设备分别从日本、英国、奥地利、瑞典等国家引进。采煤、掘进机械化程度均达100％。在宛如钢铁长城般的综采支架下，面对宫墙般的煤壁，以往在低矮的煤洞中躬腰弯背、打眼放炮落煤、挥动大锨攉煤的工人，现在只需按下电钮，扳着操作手把，就会机械轰鸣，原煤如潮，流淌到地面。
    在这种高度机械化的矿井中，怎样发扬艰苦奋斗的精神？
    兴隆庄矿领导者们认为，随着社会进步和生产力的发展，艰苦奋斗精神在不断充实、丰富和发展。不同时期、不同条件下有着不同的侧重点。在高度机械化条件下，矿领导注意引导职工刻苦学习现代化生产技术和管理，充分发挥机械效能，争创最佳经济效益。
    在兴隆庄矿投产之前，成套综采设备在山东煤矿虽有使用，但都不同程度地出现过“不是驴不走，就是磨不转”的现象。兴隆庄矿职工通过技术培训，较快地掌握了综合采煤设备的使用技术，投产不久，综采一队便在全省率先突破月产10万吨大关，接着综采二队创出了月产13.8万吨的全省最高纪录，综采三队奋起争先，以月产14.7万吨的成绩，刷新了全国同型设备的最高月产纪录，并连续三年保持着年产百万吨的全国先进水平。
    发扬艰苦奋斗精神，不该花的钱坚决不花，该花的钱也要舍得花。兴隆庄煤矿家大业大，领导精打细算，不乱花企业的钱。
    在现代化矿井达标验收之际，曾有人提议建高标准、高规格的会议室，接待室要装潢门面，然而，矿领导们认为，现代化矿井的标志是安全、产量、效益、管理等方面现代化，而不是“三室”（办公室、会议室、接待室）条件现代化。至今，在挂着“全国煤炭工业首批现代化矿井”奖牌的办公楼内，矿党委常委会议室、行政会议室及接待室内，没有豪华的装饰。洁白的桌布遮盖着裂开口的木桌。洗褪色的沙发罩裹着几经翻修的简易沙发。
    在厉行节约的同时，兴隆庄煤矿在生产建设上又敢于花钱，把好钢用在刀刃上。为了尽快实现设计生产能力，这个矿通过专家论证，果断集资337万元，与有关科研单位签订了三年内完成无煤柱开采、综合防灭火、综合防尘、岩巷掘进机械化作业线等8个方面38项联合科研协议。这个矿借助科研单位雄厚技术力量，实现了矿井技术配套，于1986年比国家计划提前一年达到年产300万吨设计能力。
    发扬艰苦奋斗精神，不是让人们啃着咸菜吃窝头，而是要人们通过辛勤劳动过上幸福生活。
    兴隆庄煤矿在提高企业经济效益的基础上不断提高职工的生活水平。1982年，全矿采煤120万吨，人均收入1071元；1986年达到300万吨设计能力上缴利润1851万元时，人均收入达到2562元；1988年生产提高到340万吨上缴利润4875万元时，人均收入提高到2944元。
    矿上建立了文化宫、体育场、人工湖、游泳池、矿区公园；丰富职工文体生活；建设了井下单身公寓楼，改善了职工居住条件；还扶持多种经营公司开办了养鸡场、养猪场、奶牛场、蔬菜基地，方便了职工生活。
    劳动带来了生活水平的提高，职工更加热爱自己的岗位，更加努力地工作。
