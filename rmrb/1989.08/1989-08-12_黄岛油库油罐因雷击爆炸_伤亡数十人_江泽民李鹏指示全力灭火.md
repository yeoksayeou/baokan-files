Yesterday morning at 10:05 AM, the 5th oil tank at the Huangdao Oil Depot's terminal was struck by lightning, causing an explosion and fire. Although the firefighters from Qingdao City and Huangdao District quickly took a series of measures to extinguish the fire, due to strong winds and intense flames, at 2:40 PM, with a loud explosion, several other nearby oil tanks also caught fire. By 8:30 PM when this report was filed, the fire had not been extinguished. Leaders from Qingdao City are on the scene directing the firefighting efforts. Medical personnel have rushed to the scene to rescue the injured. The North Sea Fleet and the Northern Aviation Bureau dispatched fire-fighting and rescue ships and seaplanes to assist in extinguishing the fire, while the Northern Aviation Bureau and the Port Authority dispatched helicopters and ships to help transport the injured.

It is reported that more than 50 injured people have been rescued so far, and about a dozen firefighters are missing.

Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary, called at midnight to instruct the governments and relevant departments at all levels in Shandong Province and Qingdao City to closely cooperate and work together to extinguish the fire.

At 23:40 last night, the office of Premier Li Peng called to inquire about the fire situation and demanded strict organization and full efforts to extinguish the fire.

At 22:50 last night, Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan asked in a phone call to the Qingdao municipal government about the difficulties in the firefighting work. He said that the State Council had urgently dispatched 20 tons of dry ice from Beijing and Shijiazhuang, sending three planes to transport it to Qingdao overnight.

Shandong Provincial Party Secretary and Governor Zhao Zhihua expressed concern over the fire at the Huangdao Oil Depot in a phone call, representing the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government.
