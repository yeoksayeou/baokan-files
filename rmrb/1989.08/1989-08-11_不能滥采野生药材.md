Right now, it is the peak season for collecting wild medicinal herbs. Many farmers are going into the mountains and grasslands to gather herbs, which not only provides a large amount of medicinal materials for the country but also increases personal income. This is generally a good thing. However, some people, in the process of collecting herbs, do not distinguish between collection areas and protected areas, nor do they care whether the herbs have grown to maturity. They dig up any herb they see, and do not fill in the holes left after digging up the herbs. This practice not only wastes medicinal resources but also damages the grasslands and forests.

For this reason, I suggest that relevant departments strengthen the management of wild medicinal herbs. At the same time, I also hope that herb collectors do not focus solely on their own immediate interests and should voluntarily comply with regulations for protecting wild resources.

    不能滥采野生药材
    眼下，正是采集野生药材的黄金季节，许多农民进山、进草原采药，既为国家提供大量药材，又可增加个人收入，本来是件好事。可是，有些人在采药过程中，不分哪是采集区、哪是保护区，也不管药材长成没有，见药就挖，挖完药材形成的坑也不填死。这样做既糟踏了药材资源，又破坏了草原和森林。
    为此，我建议有关部门加强野生药材的管理，同时也希望采药人员不要光图个人的眼前利益，应自觉遵守保护野生资源的有关规定。
