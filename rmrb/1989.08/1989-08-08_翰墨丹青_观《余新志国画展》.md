	In the land of Sichuan, where talented people and beautiful scenery abound, on the occasion of the "August 1" Army Day, Yu Xinzhi, a cadre of the Sichuan Provincial Armed Police Corps and a painter, after 35 years of relentless pursuit, finally brought more than 100 unique flower and bird paintings to the highest art hall in our country—the National Art Museum of China.

	The works on display this time are a true reflection of Yu Xinzhi's long-term immersion in life and his expression of patriotic and military enthusiasm. He is skilled in freehand flower and bird painting, particularly in painting bamboo. His paintings are written with a free and easy brush, with ink splashed freely, elegant in style, and both form and spirit are present. They have a simple and rich life atmosphere and a light and harmonious rhythm.

	Yu Xinzhi often travels between mountains and forests, experiencing life in bamboo seas and plum villages, drawing inspiration from various sources. He both learns from traditional experience and avoids clichés, both emphasizes the mastery of predecessors' brushwork, and does not adhere to old rules. With the indomitable spirit of a revolutionary soldier, he explores and innovates, finally forging his own artistic path.

    翰墨丹青
    ——观《余新志国画展》
    刘丕祥
    巴山蜀水，人杰地灵。“八一”建军节之际，武警四川总队干部、国画家余新志，在经历了35年的苦苦追求之后，终于带着百余幅匠心独具的花鸟画作品，迈进了我国最高艺术殿堂——中国美术馆。
    这次展出的作品，是余新志多年深入生活，抒发爱国爱军热情的真实写照。他擅长写意花鸟，尤以画竹独到。他的画用笔潇洒，泼墨酣畅，格调高雅，形神兼备，具有朴实浓郁的生活气息和明快和谐的轻松节韵。
    余新志常年奔波于山间丛林，竹海梅乡体验生活，博取百家而造化。他既借鉴传统经验，而又不落俗套，既注重前辈笔墨功底的练就，又不墨守成规。他以一个革命军人坚韧不拔的激情，去探索，求新，终于走出了一条自己的艺术道路。
