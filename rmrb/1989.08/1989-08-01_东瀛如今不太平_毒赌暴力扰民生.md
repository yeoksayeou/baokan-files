People's Daily, Tokyo, August 1st. Reporter Yu Qing reports: Japan's organized crime groups, known as "boryokudan," have seen their organizations grow larger in recent years, with illegal income increasing and sources of funds becoming more hidden and sophisticated. They are collaborating with overseas criminal organizations, leading to internationalized criminal activities. Internal conflicts frequently result in shootouts, posing an increasing threat to the lives of citizens. This is revealed in the "Police White Paper" released today by the Japanese National Police Agency.

The investigative data in the white paper shows that there are currently 3,197 boryokudan organizations with a total of 86,552 members. While the number of organizations and members has decreased by approximately 20% from their peak, the organizations have become more regional and series-based, increasing their operational capacity. One in every four members belongs to the largest organization, the Yamaguchi-gumi, showing a trend towards monopolistic group formation. The annual income of boryokudan is estimated at 1.3 trillion yen, primarily derived from the sale of stimulants and gambling. Illegal earnings are used for business operations, securities trading, and overseas investments. Subordinate groups remit their earnings to the leadership group, allowing the leaders to avoid direct involvement in criminal activities, making it difficult for the police to capture the ringleaders. Shootouts triggered by internal conflicts occur on average more than 200 times a year, with frequent incidents of citizens and police officers being injured or killed by gunfire. The white paper suggests that attention should be paid to the social background that tolerates the existence of boryokudan.

    东瀛如今不太平  毒赌暴力扰民生
    本报东京8月1日电　记者于青报道：日本黑社会组织暴力团近年来组织渐趋庞大，非法收入益增，资金来源更加隐蔽巧妙，勾结海外犯罪集团使犯罪活动国际化，内讧频频引起枪战，对市民生活的威胁进一步增大。这是日本警察厅今天发表的《警察白皮书》披露的。
    白皮书中的调查资料表明，暴力团现有3197个团体，共86552人。团体和人员的数量比最多时减少约2／5，但组织更加跨地区化、系列化，活动能量增大。每4人有1人属于最大组织山口组，趋向垄断集团化。暴力团年收入达1兆3千亿日元，主要是倒卖兴奋剂和赌博所得。非法所得用于企业经营、证券交易和海外投资。下属集团收入上缴领导集团，首领无需直接从事犯罪活动，警方因此难以擒贼擒王。由内讧引起的枪战年平均发生200多次，市民和警官遭受枪击伤亡屡见不鲜。白皮书提出，应警惕容忍暴力团存在的社会背景。
