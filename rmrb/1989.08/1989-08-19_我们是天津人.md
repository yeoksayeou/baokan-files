    We Are Tianjin People
    Wú Bǐngjīng

    “I know Tianjin as well as the lines on my own palm.” Many old Tianjin residents used to boast like this. Now, such words are rarely heard. It’s not because there’s a lack of topics for conversation during tea and meals, but because there are fewer places that can be described as “old” – streets and alleys are all changing, changing to the point that they are unrecognizable.

    Providing a comfortable living environment has been the fundamental ideal of politicians throughout history and the aspiration of the people. In history, a “good official” who built a dike or dug a well would be remembered for generations. In modern cities, the issue of providing a comfortable living environment is far more complex than digging a well. Tianjin residents will never forget the scenes after the earthquake: looking up, smoke and dust blocked the sun; looking down, sewage flowed everywhere; walking on the roads, cars were bumper to bumper; standing on buses, people were packed in tightly; drinking a glass of water, salt sellers had no business; eating breakfast, you had to wait so long that you felt anxious and your legs went weak. Seeing the city plagued with problems and Tianjin in a state of disrepair, Tianjin residents couldn’t help but feel disheartened.

    Those who are hungry will eat anything, and those who are thirsty will drink anything. The fate of the world often hinges on the hearts of the people. Starting from 1981, a campaign to revive the spirit of the people, rebuild their morale, and instill a sense of self-respect, self-love, and self-improvement began. Thinking about what the people want, addressing their urgent needs, and doing what they need. Everything is done for the people, and everything relies on the people. The Tianjin Municipal Committee and Municipal Government gained the trust of the people through practical work, practical deeds, and practical achievements, igniting the passion that had long been suppressed in the hearts of Tianjin residents.

    In just over eight years, the changes in Tianjin have been remarkable: over 1,000 industrial products have reached advanced domestic and international levels, and industrial output value has doubled; a city once criticized as the dirtiest and most chaotic in the country has now become a place for people to study urban construction and management; outsiders say that Tianjin’s water quality is among the best in the country, Tianjin is a “newcomer” in urban gasification, and Tianjin has the best social order; a foreign expert said, “Tianjin’s planning and layout are ambitious, and one day, Tianjin will surely become a world-class city.” Tianjin residents are proud! Because Tianjin residents have countless reasons to be proud! Isn’t that right?! When talking about the reasons for Tianjin’s tremendous changes, Comrade Lǐ Ruìhuán summarized his experience of fighting side by side with the Tianjin people with a concise and meaningful phrase: “Because we are Tianjin people!”

    Tianjin residents support the Party and the government. During the turmoil, why didn’t Tianjin descend into chaos? Although outsiders have various speculations, Tianjin residents know best. Here, let’s recall a scene at the Jìlǐtái Interchange: early in the morning, a small group of troublemakers attempting to cause disturbances blocked workers on their way to work. A female worker argued, “You talk about freedom, right? Going to work on time is my freedom! Whoever wants to disrupt Tianjin’s good situation, we won’t allow it!” Soon, the flow of people going to work broke through the human barrier. Why didn’t the troublemakers’ incitements attract anyone’s attention? Why did the Party and the government’s call to “defend Tianjin and defend the people” receive an overwhelming response? Because “the Party and the government serve the people, and the people support the Party and the government” has long been a consensus among Tianjin residents. Tianjin residents have no reason to ruin their own present; everything is soaked with their sweat. Their wise attitude is quite simple: giving up today means there is no tomorrow.

    Tianjin residents value hard work and self-sacrifice. When Tianjin residents endured the hard times with unwavering perseverance, they truly understood the value of hard work. From Haíhé Park to the Yǐnhùndùng Canal, from the Ancient Culture Street to the Food Street, from the Great Wall in Jì County to the new Tianjin Railway Station, Tianjin residents contributed money, labor, and ideas, using their wisdom and hands to build their own home. Hundreds of thousands of volunteer laborers showcased the spirit of Tianjin people, finding satisfaction and pride in their self-sacrifice. “The people build the people’s city” has long evolved from a slogan on the wall to the voice of millions. The inner ring road, outer ring road, and middle ring road, 14 radial roads, all interconnected, line by line. Through these interconnected urban arteries, you can feel the spirit of progress and innovation bursting forth!

    Tianjin residents are good at philosophical thinking. A city is a complex, comprehensive, and organic whole, with various components interacting and constraining each other. Studying a city means studying these relationships and, through work, making the entire city move forward in a coordinated and stable manner. Tianjin concretely implements annual planning measures into 10 or 20 major tasks, so the city’s overall planning is no longer just a drawing on paper or a “blueprint of the final state” hung on the wall. Every Tianjin resident knows what practical tasks the municipal government is doing this year and next year. Thus, the relationship between leaders and the masses, individuals and the whole, and parts and the whole becomes harmonious and tacit.

    Tianjin residents are studying urban aesthetics. Since there are no two identical leaves in the world, why do we have so many identical residential buildings? Therefore, houses have evolved from a single appearance to emphasizing height differences, staggered arrangements, and diverse styles; the broken walls and “rag curtains” on both sides of the roads have been transformed into delicate fences or flower windows. “Green in every crack” can be considered a new creation in language and practice, with greenery appearing in courtyards, balconies, and street centers, and then spreading like mercury to become small parks and green spaces, beautifying the city and nurturing people’s sentiments.

    The sun is new every day. The phrase “We are Tianjin people” is adding new colors and meanings every year, every month, and every day.

### 我们是天津人

    我们是天津人
    吴炳晶
    “我熟悉天津就像熟悉自己手上的指纹。”不少老天津人曾经这样夸口。如今，这话很少听见了。不是因为茶余饭后缺少了谈资，而是能够说“古”的地方太少了——大街小巷都在变，变得让人认不出来。
    安居乐业是历代社会政治家的基本理想和百姓的期望。历史上的“循吏”修了一个堤堰，挖了一口井，就流芳千古。现代城市，安居问题绝不像挖一口井那么简单。天津人忘不了地震后的景象：抬头看，烟尘蔽日；低头看，污水横流；马路上走，车挨车；汽车上站，人挤人；喝一口水，卖盐的没有生意做；吃一次早点，让你等得心急火燎、腿软筋麻。望着处处患“病”的城市，望着满目疮痍、难以为继的天津，天津人不禁心灰意冷。
    饥者甘食，渴者甘饮。天下之势，常系民心。从1981年开始，一场再振民心，再造民气，再树自尊、自爱、自强的战役开始了。想群众之所想，急群众之所急，办群众之所需。一切想着人民，一切依靠人民。天津市委、市政府以实干、实事、实绩取信于民，使天津人久蕴心底的激情火一般喷发出来。
    短短8年多的时间，天津的变化让人刮目相看：1000多种工业产品达到国内外先进水平，工业总产值翻了一番；过去被人们批评为全国最脏最乱的城市，如今成了人们参观研究城市建设和城市管理的地方；外地人说，天津的水质在全国城市中数一数二，天津是城市煤气化的暴发户，天津的社会秩序最好；一位外国专家说，天津的规划布局雄心勃勃，有朝一日，天津一定会成为世界名城。天津人自豪了！因为天津人有许许多多的理由值得自豪！不是吗？！说到天津发生巨大变化的原因，李瑞环同志从他和天津人民并肩奋战的实践中，归纳出一句言简意赅的话：“因为我们是天津人！”
    天津人给党和政府“作劲”。在动乱中，天津为什么没有乱起来？尽管外地人有种种猜测，但天津人心里最清楚。这里不妨再现八里台立交桥上的一个画面：清晨，一小撮妄图制造事端的动乱分子拦截上班的工人。一位女工争辩说：“你们不是讲自由吗，按时上班就是我的自由！谁想破坏天津的好局面，我们就不答应！”很快，上班的人流冲垮了人墙。为什么动乱分子的鼓噪无人理睬，为什么党和政府提出“保卫天津、保卫人民”的口号就一呼百应？因为“党和政府为人民办事，人民为党和政府作劲”，早已成为天津人的共识。天津人没有理由糟蹋自己的今天，一切一切都浸透了他们的汗水。他们的明智态度说来是十分朴素的：放弃今天，就没有明天。
    天津人讲艰苦奋斗、讲奉献精神。当天津人以顽强的毅力熬过了困苦的日子，他们真正认识了艰苦奋斗的价值。从海河公园到引滦明渠，从古文化街到食品街，从蓟县长城到天津新客站，天津人出钱、出力、出主意，用智慧和双手建设自己的家园。几十万义务劳动大军展示了天津人的风采，他们在奉献中找到了欣慰和自豪。“人民城市人民建”，早已从墙上的标语变为千百万人的心声。中环线、外环线、内环线，14条放射线，环环相接，线线相连。通过这成环成网的城市动脉，你会感到天津人奋进、创新的意识和能量在这里迸发！
    天津人善于哲学思考。城市是个复杂的、综合的有机整体，各个组成部分之间存在着相互制约的关系。研究城市，就是研究这种关系，通过工作，使整个城市协调、平稳地向前推进。天津把每年实现规划的措施具体落到10件、20件大事上来，这样，城市的总体规划不再是纸上画画、墙上挂挂，或是“终极状态的蓝图”了。每个天津人都知道市政府今年干什么实事、明年干什么实事。于是，领导与群众、个人与整体、局部与全局的关系就变得和谐默契了。
    天津人正在钻研城市美学。世上既然没有两片相同的叶子，为什么我们要搞那么多千人一面的住宅呢？于是，房屋由单一面貌，开始讲究高低有别、错落有致、风格各异；道路两旁的断壁残垣、“破烂围裙”被改造了，变成了玲珑剔透的围栏或花窗。见缝插“绿”可算是语言和实践上的一个新创造，绿色在庭院、阳台、街心上落脚，进而水银泻地般扩展成为小公园、小绿地，美化了城市，陶冶着人们的情操。
    太阳每天都是新的。“我们是天津人”这句话，每年每月每天都在增添新的色彩和内涵。
