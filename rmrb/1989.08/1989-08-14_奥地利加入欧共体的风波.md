The Soviet government on August 10 handed a memorandum to the Austrian government expressing "concern" over Austria's application to join the European Economic Community. This news immediately stirred up a storm in Austria. Government officials, leaders of various parties, and business figures all expressed their views, making Austria's application to join the EEC once again a hot topic of concern.

In the memorandum, the Soviet Union pointed out that Austria's joining the EEC would mean losing the "actual possibility of pursuing a neutral policy." Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Perfiliev more explicitly stated in a telephone interview with Austrian television on August 11 that Austria's obligation to the Soviet Union in April 1955, to legally establish a policy of permanent neutrality, was a precondition for the Soviet Union's agreement to the restoration of a sovereign and independent Austria. The Soviet Union also stated that as a signatory to the 1955 "Treaty on the Restoration of an Independent and Democratic Austrian State," the Soviet Union "naturally has the historical obligation to defend the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Austrian Republic." The Soviet Union's stance effectively indicates its disapproval of Austria's efforts to join the European Economic Community. This is the first official statement from the Soviet Union on this issue since Austria's government submitted its application to the EEC on June 17.

Austria responded quickly to this. Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky reiterated that Austria would "in no way deviate from its neutral policy." In an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung on August 11, he also stated that the precondition for Austria's joining the EEC is to establish its neutral policy "in writing or in another legally binding document."

Austrian Vice-Chancellor Josef Riegler and Foreign Minister Alois Mock also expressed more cautious views on the Soviet Union's stance.

However, Austrian Economic Minister Rudolf Streichl stated on August 12 that Austria does not need "teachers." He also, on behalf of Chancellor Vranitzky and Foreign Minister Mock, stated that while discussing Austria's application to join the EEC, Austria would consider the comments of other countries, "but not too much."

Professor Kurt Josef Waldheim, the legal affairs spokesman for the Austrian People's Party, commented on the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman's remarks on August 12, pointing out that the idea of linking the 1955 "State Treaty" with Austria's neutral policy is "incorrect." "Austria's neutrality has no legal connection with the State Treaty. The basis for permanent neutrality is the Austrian Constitution."

The Austrian business community once again emphasized the necessity of Austria joining the EEC. The Austrian Federation of Industry issued a statement pointing out that for well-known reasons, Austria's complete integration into the European unification process is absolutely necessary. This can only be achieved by becoming a member of the Community.

Observers here believe that although the Austrian political circles have repeatedly emphasized adherence to neutrality as a precondition for Austria's joining the EEC, due to the "concern" of the Soviet Union, which is a signatory to the 1955 "State Treaty," Austria's path to joining the EEC will be more difficult. As Chancellor Vranitzky acknowledged in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Austria's neutrality obligations may become an obstacle to Austria's joining the EEC. The prospects for negotiations between Austria and the EEC on the issue of joining are indeed optimistic, "but not one hundred percent" guaranteed to succeed.

    奥地利加入欧共体的风波
    新华社记者　刘钢
    苏联政府于8月10日向奥地利政府递交了一份备忘录，对奥地利申请加入欧洲共同体一事表示“关注”。这一消息立即在奥地利国内引起一阵风波。政府官员、各党派领袖及经济界人士纷纷发表看法，使奥地利加入欧共体的问题再度成为人们关心的热点。
    苏联在这份备忘录中指出，奥地利加入欧共体将意味着失去了“实行中立政策的实际可能性”，苏联外交部发言人佩尔菲利耶夫在11日接受奥地利电视台的电话采访时则更为明确地表示，奥地利1955年4月向苏联承担的义务：即把永久中立的政策以法律形式确定下来，是苏联同意重建一个主权完整的奥地利的前提。苏联还表示，作为1955年《重建独立和民主的奥地利国家条约》的签字国，苏联“理所当然地要履行它的历史义务——捍卫奥地利共和国的独立、主权和领土完整”。苏联的这一态度实际上是表明不赞成奥地利加入欧洲共同体的努力。这也是自今年6月17日奥地利政府向欧共体提出加入申请以来，苏联在这一问题上的首次正式表态。
    奥地利各方很快对此作出了反应。奥地利总理弗拉尼茨基再次重申，奥地利绝不会“丝毫偏离它的中立政策”。他在11日接受《南德意志报》采访时也表示，奥地利加入欧共体的前提是，将中立政策“以书面的或在另外的具有法律效力的文件中”确定下来。
    奥地利副总理里格尔和外长莫克对苏联的这一态度也发表了较为谨慎的看法。
    但奥地利经济部长许塞尔则在12日发表谈话说，奥地利不需要“教师爷”。他还代表总理弗拉尼茨基和外长莫克表示，奥地利在讨论其加入欧共体的问题时，虽然会考虑其它国家的评论，“但不会考虑很多”。
    奥地利人民党的法律事务发言人科尔教授12日就苏联外交部发言人的说法发表评论时指出，这种把1955年的《国家条约》同奥地利的中立政策联系在一起的提法是“不正确”的。“奥地利的中立与《国家条约》没有任何法律联系。永久中立的依据是奥地利的宪法。”
    奥地利实业界则再次重申了奥地利加入欧共体的必要性。奥地利工业家协会发表声明指出，由于众所周知的原因，奥地利完全加入欧洲一体化进程是绝对必要的。而这一点也只有成为共同体的成员国才有可能实现。
    此间观察家认为，尽管奥地利政界一再重申恪守中立是奥地利加入欧共体的前提，但由于作为1955年《国家条约》签字国之一的苏联的“关注”，奥地利在其谋求加入欧共体的道路上举步将更加艰难。正如弗拉尼茨基总理在接受《南德意志报》采访时所承认的那样，奥地利的中立义务很可能会成为奥地利加入欧共体的障碍。奥地利与欧共体就加入问题进行谈判的前景固然乐观，“但并非百分之百”能成功。
