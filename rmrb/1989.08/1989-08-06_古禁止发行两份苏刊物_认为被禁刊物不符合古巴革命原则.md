Cuba has decided to ban the continued publication of two Soviet magazines, *Moscow News* weekly and *Sputnik* monthly, deeming them to be in violation of Cuba's revolutionary principles. This is the first time since 1959 that the Cuban government has taken such action against Soviet publications.

The decision was announced by the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, *Granma*.

The newspaper stated that numerous letters from government and military officials, as well as from the media, had been received by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, calling for the banning of the aforementioned Soviet publications.

The editorial statement in *Granma* said that *Moscow News* and *Sputnik* have been promoting "bourgeois democracy as the highest form of people's participation," advocating "the American way of life," and even asserting that "imperialism no longer exists."

The statement further argued that these publications "deny Soviet history," "defame and insult Lenin," and promote "pluralism, private ownership, and anarchism."

Currently, there are 36 Soviet publications being distributed in Cuba.

    古禁止发行两份苏刊物
    认为被禁刊物不符合古巴革命原则
    新华社哈瓦那8月4日电　古巴共产党中央委员会4日决定禁止在古巴继续发行苏联杂志《莫斯科新闻》周刊和《旅伴》月刊，认为这两种刊物长期“宣传资产阶级民主”，不符合古巴的“革命原则”。这是古巴政府自1959年取得政权以来第一次对苏联刊物采取这种措施。
    这一决定是古巴共产党机关报《格拉玛报》宣布的。
    这家报纸说，古巴一些政府和军队干部以及舆论界不断致信古共中央委员会，要求查封上述苏联刊物。
    《格拉玛报》发表的编辑部声明说，《莫斯科新闻》和《旅伴》宣扬“资产阶级民主是人民参政的最高形式”，鼓吹“美国的生活方式”，甚至断言“帝国主义已不复存在”。
    声明认为，这两种刊物还“否定苏联历史”，“污辱谩骂列宁”，宣扬“多元主义、私有制和无政府主义”。
    目前在古巴发行的苏联刊物共有36种。
