	Mountain
	Meng Xue

	I will stand here for a lifetime
	Not just waiting for me
	But also for every dreamer
	The geese complain about the harsh winter
	And the autumn has drifted away
	But I cannot
	Cannot abandon you
	Every season that is not to my liking
	Nor can I say goodbye to you
	To seek another thing called
	“River” or “Lake”
	Remembering when I first came
	I was astonished
	“You are so vast”
	You slightly nodded in my heart, like a plain
	“I have been waiting for you for a long time”

专栏：

    山
    梦雪
    一辈子就立在这里了
    不只等我
    也等每一个喜爱幻想的人
    雁唳嫌冬日太苦秋天漂去
    而我无法
    无法摒弃你的
    每一个不如意的季节
    也无法告别你
    去寻找另一种叫做
    “河”或“湖”的东西
    想起刚来的时候
    我不胜惊讶
    “你好大呵”
    你在我平原似的心中
    略略颔首
    “我候你多时”
