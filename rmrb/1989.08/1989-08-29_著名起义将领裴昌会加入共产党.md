	Renowned Uprising Leader Pei Changhui Joins the Communist Party
		People's Daily reports: With the approval of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee and the agreement of the Central Organization Department, 93-year-old Pei Changhui, a member of the 7th National People's Congress, honorary vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and vice-chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, joined the Communist Party of China on August 22. Upon learning of this news on August 23 while in bed, he was moved to tears and repeatedly said, "Thank you to the Party, thank you to the Party. A 40-year wish has been fulfilled, I am so happy!"

	Pei Changhui was once a subordinate of the warlord Sun Chuanfang and held important positions in the Kuomintang army for a long time. He successively served as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Fourth Army Group of the Kuomintang, deputy commander of the Xi'an Garrison Command, and commander of the Fifth and Seventh Army Groups. In the late stage of the War of Liberation, he personally felt the corruption of the Kuomintang and, under the influence of our Party's policies, led his troops to revolt in Deyang, Sichuan in December 1949, embarking on a new path.

	Since liberation, Pei Changhui has been fully trusted by the Party organization and has held many important leadership positions. In 1954, Chairman Mao personally received him. In 1955, the central government awarded him the "First-Class Liberation Medal." The stark contrast between the pre- and post-liberation periods and 40 years of revolutionary practice made him see the tremendous changes that have taken place in New China under the leadership of the Communist Party. He deeply felt the truth that "without the Communist Party, there would be no New China," and in his thoughts, he firmly believed in communism. Many years ago, Pei Changhui had already applied to join the Party. Over the following decades, whether in good times or bad, his belief in the Party remained unchanged, and his pursuit of the Party was unwavering.

	Recently, after the political turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, Taiwan spread rumors that Chongqing was in turmoil. He told his relatives in Taiwan in a phone call about the actual situation he had seen with his own eyes, informing them that the situation in Chongqing was stable and explaining the necessity of the central government's suppression of the rebellion.

	Facing the one-sided propaganda of some overseas news agencies and the doubts of some people who do not understand the true situation about the Communist Party, the elderly Pei, lying on his sickbed, recalled the Party's care for him over the decades and the great achievements of the ten years of reform, and could not help but express his wish to join the Party organization once again. Now, this old man has finally realized his wish.

    著名起义将领裴昌会加入共产党
    本报讯　经中共四川省委批准并报经中央组织部同意，93岁高龄的七届全国人大代表、民革中央名誉副主席，重庆市政协副主席裴昌会同志，8月22日光荣加入中国共产党。23日当他在病床上得知此消息时，激动得热泪盈眶，连声说：“感谢党，感谢党，40年的愿望实现了，太高兴了！”
    裴昌会同志早年系军阀孙传芳旧部，长期在国民党部队担任要职，先后任过国民党第四集团军副总司令，西安绥靖公署副长官，第五、第七兵团中将司令官。解放战争后期，他亲身感受到国民党的腐败，并在我党政策感召下，于1949年12月率部在四川德阳起义，走上新生之路。
    解放以来，裴昌会受到党组织的充分信任，担任过许多重要领导职务。1954年，毛主席曾亲自接见他。1955年，中央政府授予他“一级解放勋章”。解放前后的鲜明对比，40年的革命实践，使他看到了新中国在共产党领导下发生的翻天覆地的巨大变化，他深切体会到了“没有共产党就没有新中国”这一真理，在思想上坚定了对共产主义的信念。早在多年前，裴昌会同志就提出了入党申请，以后几十年间无论顺境逆境，他对党的信念始终不变，对党的追求矢志不改。
    最近，北京发生政治动乱和反革命暴乱后，台湾谣传重庆发生暴乱，他与在台湾的亲属通话中用亲眼所见的事实辟谣，告诉他们重庆形势稳定，并宣讲中央平暴的必要性。
    面对海外某些新闻机构的片面宣传和部分不明真象的人对共产党的怀疑情绪，身卧病榻的裴老抚今追昔，反复回想共产党几十年来对他的关怀和十年改革的巨大成就，忍不住再一次表达了他加入党组织的愿望。如今，这位老人终于如愿以偿了。
