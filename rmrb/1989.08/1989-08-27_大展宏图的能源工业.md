Over the past 40 years, as the national productive forces layout has gradually adjusted, the hardworking people of various ethnic groups in Guizhou, along with a group of builders from all over the country, have worked side by side. Three pillar industries with clear resource orientation and certain regional suitability—energy, raw materials, and mechanical and electronic industries—have risen in the Guizhou Plateau and are becoming an important force supporting the economic development of coastal regions and the modernization of socialist construction in China.

The Prosperous Energy Industry

On June 6 of this year, a responsible person from the Guizhou Provincial Electric Power Industry Bureau revealed information: By the year 2000, Guizhou will be built into an energy province in southern China.

This is the grand plan for revitalizing Guizhou's energy industry.

By the end of 1988, the province's proven coal reserves amounted to 79 billion tons, with 48.8 billion tons in reserve. Out of the 86 counties (cities) in the province, 74 have coal. This makes Guizhou stand out in the south of the Yangtze River, earning the title of "coal sea of the south." After 40 years of development and construction, a coal industry system that includes state-controlled coal mines, provincial coal mines, county coal mines, and township coal mines has taken shape. A coal industry workforce of tens of thousands of workers, equipped with departments for exploration, design, construction, mining, processing, mechanical manufacturing, and services, has become the backbone force for the continuous expansion of Guizhou's modern coal industry in both breadth and depth. In 1988, the province's raw coal production reached 32 million tons. In recent years, Guizhou has annually supplied nearly 6 million tons of commercial coal to various provinces and regions in the south, becoming the largest coal-exporting province in the south.

Guizhou's hydropower resources have a developable capacity of 13.25 million kilowatts, ranking seventh in the country. The province's largest river, the Wujiang, is the seventh largest tributary of the Yangtze River, but its developable hydropower resources rank third among the major tributaries of the Yangtze River. Due to its superior comprehensive development conditions, it is known as China's third "hydropower mine." The completion of the Wujiangdu Power Station with an installed capacity of 630,000 kilowatts on the Wujiang main stream and six cascading power stations with a total installed capacity of 239,000 kilowatts on the Maojian River, a tributary, has accumulated rich experience for the development of hydropower in karst regions in China.

Guizhou is located in the Yangtze and Pearl River watershed. On the Wujiang River, the Dongfeng Hydropower Station with an installed capacity of 510,000 kilowatts is under construction; the Tianxingqiao Second-Level Hydropower Station on the Nanpan River will be fully completed in 1993; a number of large and medium-sized thermal power plants will be built and put into operation within a few years. Following the development direction of coal and electricity, water and fire complementing each other, an energy industry pattern that realizes cross-basin power compensation and regulation is taking shape.

### 大展宏图的能源工业

    40年来，随着国家生产力布局的逐步调整，勤劳的贵州各族人民和一批来自全国各地的建设者并肩战斗，具有明显资源指向性和一定地域适宜性的三大支柱产业——能源工业、原材料工业和机械电子工业，已在贵州高原崛起，正成为支撑沿海地区经济发展和国家社会主义现代化建设的一支重要力量。
    大展宏图的能源工业
    今年6月6日，贵州省电力工业局负责人透出信息：在2000年前后把贵州建成中国南部能源省。
    这是贵州振兴能源工业的宏图。
    截至1988年底，全省煤炭探明储量790亿吨，保有储量488亿吨，全省86个县（市）中74个县（市）有煤。这使得贵州在长江以南一枝独秀，人称“江南煤海”。经过40年的开发建设，一个包括国家统配煤矿、省属煤矿、地县煤矿以及乡镇煤矿的煤炭工业体系已具规模，一支拥有十几万职工，具有勘探、设计、施工、采掘加工、机械制造和服务部门的煤炭大军，成为贵州现代煤炭工业不断向广度和深度开拓的中坚力量。1988年，全省原煤产量达3200万吨。近年来，贵州每年向江南各省区提供商品煤近600万吨，成为江南最大的煤炭输出省。
    贵州水能资源可开发量为1325万千瓦，居全国第七位。省内第一大河乌江虽为长江第七大支流，可开发的水能资源却居长江各大支流第三位，因其优越的综合开发条件，被誉为我国第三“水电富矿”。乌江干流上装机63万千瓦的乌江渡电站和支流猫跳河上总装机23.9万千瓦的6个梯级电站的建成，为我国岩溶地区的水能开发积累了丰富经验。
    贵州位于长江、珠江分水岭地带。乌江上，装机51万千瓦的东风水电站正紧张建设；南盘江上，天生桥二级水电站1993年将全部完工；一批大中型火电厂几年内将建成投产。循着煤电并举、水火互济的开发方向，实现跨流域电力补偿调节的能源工业格局正在形成。
