The Marxism-Leninism teaching and research room at the Xin Yang Army Academy has steadfastly fought against the bourgeois liberalization trend, boldly propagated the truth of Marxism-Leninism, and focused on cultivating young officers with excellent political qualities. It has received commendations from the academy party committee for two consecutive years and has been awarded a collective third-class merit.

This teaching and research room has always regarded giving good Marxism-Leninism theory courses as an important part of cultivating the political qualities of young cadets. When some so-called "new viewpoints," "new trends," and "new schools" were making noise for a time in the theoretical circles, the teaching and research room did not blindly follow them. For issues that are not suitable to be discussed in the classroom, they strictly control the content to prevent confusion in the cadets' thoughts. When a wave of completely denying class struggle emerged in society, the leaders and teachers of the teaching and research room, from the facts that various criminal activities are still rampant in the economic front and other fields, further recognized the great guiding significance of the Marxist class struggle theory in the primary stage of socialism. For many years, they have consistently and unshakably taught the theory of class struggle.

This teaching and research room places the focus of political theory teaching on helping young cadets eliminate wrong ideas and establish a correct worldview. Teachers use forms such as holding symposiums, heart-to-heart talks, and written Q&A to understand the cadets' ideological problems, and list a large number of facts to illustrate the correctness of Marxism. Through patient and meticulous theoretical guidance, some young cadets have transformed from doubting Marxism-Leninism to firmly believing in it.

    信阳陆院马列室坚持理论疏导
    新华社济南电　（通讯员潘时常、记者蒋永武）解放军信阳陆军学院马列教研室坚定不移地与资产阶级自由化思潮展开斗争，理直气壮地宣传马列主义真理，着力培养政治素质优良的青年军官，连续两年受到学院党委嘉奖，荣立了集体三等功。
    这个教研室始终把上好马列主义理论课视为培养青年学员优良政治素质的重要一环。当理论界一些所谓的“新观点”、“新思潮”、“新流派”鼓噪一时之际，教研室对此不轻信盲从。凡是不宜上讲坛的问题，严格把关，防止搞乱学员思想。当社会上出现一股全盘否定阶级斗争的论调时，教研室领导和教员从经济战线和其他领域各种犯罪活动有时还很猖獗的事实，进一步认识马克思主义阶级斗争学说在社会主义初级阶段的重大指导意义，几年来一直毫不动摇地讲授阶级斗争理论。
    这个教研室把政治理论教学的落脚点放在帮助青年学员消除错误观念，树立正确的人生观上。教员们利用召开座谈会、谈心、书面问答等形式，摸清学员的思想症结，列举大量事实说明马克思主义的正确性。通过耐心细致的理论疏导，一些青年学员由怀疑马列转变为坚信马列。
