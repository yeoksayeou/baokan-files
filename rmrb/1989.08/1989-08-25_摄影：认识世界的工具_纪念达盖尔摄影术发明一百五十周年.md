	Photography: A Tool for Understanding the World
	— Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the Invention of Daguerreotype Photography
	Chen Jianhua

	The invention of photography by humanity has reached its 150th anniversary this August 19th. During this period, photography has not only evolved from its inception, development, to perfection, becoming a discipline, but it has also directly influenced the development of modern human civilization, becoming a means to drive human civilization forward, becoming knowledge and power.

	Looking back 150 years ago, superstitious and conservative people cursed photography as "strange and lewd tricks" and "heretical sorcery." Later, some people used photography as a tool for making money and entertainment. It has been proven that these views are one-sided. Now, more people and artists regard photography as an artistic tool. However, limiting photography to the realm of art and ignoring its role in promoting culture, science, and technology still does not encompass the multifaceted functions of photography. It should be said that photography is a tool for humanity to understand the world. It provides the basis for humans to understand the objective world and enriches the cultural knowledge of the subjective world. It develops human understanding of the world from physiological instincts to the basis of scientific tools, making human understanding of the world closer to the truth. At the same time, with the help of photography's information transmission characteristics, humans can more broadly, timely, vividly, deeply, and truly understand the world. Photography also combines the practical value and aesthetic value of human understanding of the world, elevating human spirits to the realm of truth, goodness, and beauty. It can be said that today's world, without photography, would be unimaginable.

	Photography, as a tool for humanity to understand the world, inevitably drives human civilization.

	Photography has given humanity a "scientific eye" and an "intelligent brain." To understand the world, humans must have vision, hearing, and memory. Humans receive external information, 90% of which is received through the eyes. Human thinking, judgment, and memory largely depend on the brain. However, facing the vast world, the functions of human eyes and brain are physiologically limited. To overcome the physiological limitations of the eyes and brain, humans have fantasized about having "thousand-mile eyes," "wise eyes," and "photographic memory," but these are just fantasies. Photography compensates for the physiological limitations of human eyes and brain, achieving what humans desire and can do. It helps humans record, reflect, and preserve the objective appearance and reality of things, extending the functions of human eyes and brain. Therefore, people call photography the "third eye" and "second brain" of humans, or the "scientific eye" and "intelligent brain" of humans.

	Photography has created a visual "language and script." The invention of language and script by humanity was a leap forward in understanding the world, and human civilized life began. However, as humans' understanding of the world deepens, language and script also have their limitations in meeting human needs for the world. It is subject to regional, ethnic, and cultural restrictions, concepts are abstract, and it is not easy to transmit and preserve. Therefore, humans need a new visual and intuitive tool that is not limited by time and space, easy to record and preserve, and can timely and widely transmit recognition to supplement the shortcomings of language and script. This new visual "language and script" is photography.

	Photography has given birth to photojournalism and developed the news industry. In history, the function of recording news was literature and painting. In China's classics such as the Classics, History, Masters, and Collections, and a large number of paintings, many contents record news events at that time. However, due to the invention of photographic printing, the development of printing was promoted. With the development of printing, transportation, and communication industries, news media and news industries emerged. News became independent and no longer belonged to the realm of literature and painting. It strengthened the function of literature and painting in reflecting news. After news became independent, photography became a very active factor in news information transmission. Photography made textual news visual, expanded the scope and subjects of news reporting, and further consolidated the expansion and independence of the news industry.

	Photography has driven the development of the image industry and promoted the arrival of the television era.

	Photography, as a tool for humanity to understand the world, drives the progress of human civilization. At the same time, photography itself is also a product of civilization and a manifestation of human civilized practical experience. Without the development of human civilization, there would be no conditions for the invention and production of photography. The entire history of photography development is also a side of human civilization history. Humans have explored photography for thousands of years, but it was only in modern times, with the outbreak of the industrial technological revolution in the human world, that the exploration of photography entered a new stage. In 1802, Thomas Wedgwood used new knowledge of physics and chemistry to create a pinhole camera and successfully experimented with silver salt photography. In 1814, Nicéphore Niépce of France created the "artificial eye" — the world's first practical camera. Finally, in 1839, Daguerreotype photography was born. Humans pursue civilization, and human civilization satisfies human pursuits. The invention and development of photography are undoubtedly the results of human civilization and the development of human civilization.

    摄影：认识世界的工具
    ——纪念达盖尔摄影术发明一百五十周年
    陈建华
    人类发明摄影术，到今年8月19日，整150周年了。这个期间，摄影不仅由产生、发展到完善，成为一门学科，而且直接影响着人类现代文明的发展，成为推动人类文明发展的手段，成为知识和力量。
    回顾150年前的时候，迷信保守的人，咒诅摄影是“奇巧淫技”、“异端邪术”。以后，有人曾把摄影当做赚钱、消遣的工具。事实证明，这些都是片面的。现在更多的人们和艺术家，把摄影当做艺术的工具。但是，只把摄影限制在艺术范围里，忽视它对文化科学技术的推动作用，还不能涵盖摄影的多重性作用。应当说，摄影是人类认识世界的工具，它为人类认识客观世界提供依据，也为人类主观世界丰富文化知识。它把人类对世界的认识，由人自身的生理本能，发展到科学工具认识的基础上来，使人对世界的认识更接近了真理。同时，借助摄影传递信息的特质，人类能更广泛、更及时、更形象、更深刻、更真实地认识世界了。摄影还把人类认识世界的实用价值和审美价值结合起来，使人的精神升华到真、善、美的境界。可以这样说，今天的世界，人类离开了摄影，世界将会变得不可想象。
    摄影是人类认识世界的工具，必然推动人类文明。
    摄影给人类带来了“科学眼”和“智工脑”。人类要认识世界，必须有视、听和记忆等。人接受外界信息，有90％是经过眼睛接收的。人的思维、判断和记忆，大部分依靠大脑。但是，面对大千世界，人的眼、脑作用是有生理局限的。人类为了克服眼、脑的生理局限，曾幻想“千里眼”、“慧眼”和“过目不忘”，但这只是空想。而摄影弥补了人眼、脑的生理局限，达到人所欲和能为的地步。助人记录、反映、留取客观事物景象和现实，摄影延伸了人眼、脑的作用。所以，人们把摄影称为人的“第三只眼睛”和“第二只大脑”，或者称为人的“科学眼睛”和“智工脑”。
    摄影创造了形象化的“语言文字”。人类发明了语言文字，这对于认识世界是一次飞跃，人类文明生活开始了。但是，随着人类对世界认识发展的深入，语言文字对人类世界的需要也是有局限的。它受地域、民族和文化限制大，概念抽象，不易传递保留。因此，人类需要一种新的形象化和直观的、不受时空限制的、易于记录留存、并及时和广泛传递的认识工具，以便真实、形象、精确、快速和广泛地传递认识，弥补语言文字的不足。这种新的形象化的“语言文字”，便是摄影。
    摄影孕育产生了新闻摄影，发展了新闻事业。历史上记载新闻的功能是文学和绘画，我国的经、史、子、集等古籍和大量的绘画中，很多内容记载着当时的新闻事件。但是，由于照相制版的发明，推动了印刷的发展。又由于印刷、交通和通讯事业的发展，产生了新闻媒介和新闻事业。新闻独立了，它不再属于文学和绘画范围了，它加强了文学绘画反映新闻的功能。新闻独立之后，摄影成为新闻传递信息十分活跃的因素。摄影使文字新闻形象化扩展了采访的题材和领域，更巩固了新闻事业的扩展和独立。
    摄影带动了影像事业的发展，推动电视时代的到来。
    摄影是人类认识世界的工具，推动人类文明的前进。同时，摄影自身也是文明的产物，是人类文明实践经验的体现，没有人类文明的发展，便没有摄影发明产生的条件。整个摄影发展的历史，也是人类文明史的一个侧面。人类对摄影有上千年的探索，但只是到了近代，随着人类世界工业技术革命的爆发，人类对摄影的探索才走向新的阶段。1802年托马斯·韦季伍德利用物理化学的新知识，制成针孔成相镜箱和试验银盐感光留影成功；1814年法国的尼普斯制成了“人工魔眼”——世界第一台实用照相机；终于在1839年诞生了达盖尔摄影术。人类追求文明，又是人类文明满足了人类的追求。摄影的发明和发展无疑是人类文明的成果，又是人类文明的发展。
