Kunming has established full-time science and technology personnel in townships and organized and managed science and technology demonstration households to promote new technologies, forming a new science and technology work network in rural areas, effectively implementing science and technology management work at the grassroots level.

For a long time, Kunming has lacked science and technology management institutions and personnel below the county and district science and technology commissions, resulting in a situation where there is a "head without legs." Since 1986, Kunming has successively established science and technology personnel in 114 townships and villages across the city, and built more than 3,500 science and technology demonstration households in villages and communities, forming a rural science and technology work network with county and district science and technology commissions at the helm, township and village science and technology personnel as bridges, and village and community science and technology demonstration households as the foundation.

These science and technology personnel not only serve as important assistants to the county and district science and technology commissions but also as consultants and assistants to the township and village leaders in science and technology work. They often conduct in-depth investigations and propose suggestions on the problems existing in the promotion and popularization of scientific and technological knowledge in the local area. Many of these suggestions have been adopted by the local party committees and governments.

They also introduce and promote some practical technologies according to the characteristics of the township economy, benefiting many people.

Through the role of science and technology demonstration households, the network has played a demonstration effect of "lighting a lamp to illuminate a large area."

According to a recent survey by the Kunming Municipal Science and Technology Commission on 850 science and technology demonstration households established in 1986, these households have influenced and led more than 7,600 farmers around them to varying degrees to embark on the road to prosperity through science and technology. Now, Kunming has formed 92 science and technology demonstration villages.

In recent years, Kunming has always regarded the rural science and technology network as an important basic work. They have adopted the method of selecting the best for science and technology personnel and recommended and approved science and technology demonstration households according to conditions, respectively formulating management regulations, clearly defining their respective responsibilities, tasks, remuneration, and reward and punishment measures.

The municipal science and technology commission has also established a development fund for science and technology personnel and regularly evaluates and rewards science and technology personnel and science and technology demonstration households.

    乡镇设专职干事  基层有工作网络
    科技在昆明市郊“生根”
    据新华社昆明8月7日电　（记者姜振岗）昆明市通过在乡、镇设立科技干事，组织和管理科技示范户开展新技术的示范、推广，建起农村新型科技工作网络，使科技管理工作有效地落实到最基层。
    长期以来，昆明市由于县区科委以下无科技管理机构和人员，普遍存在“有头无腿”的状况。自1986年起，昆明市先后在全市114个乡、镇设立了科技干事，在村、社建起了3500多户科技示范户，从而形成了一个以县区科委为首，乡镇科技干事为桥梁，村、社科技示范户为基础的农村科技工作网络。
    这些科技干事不仅是县区科委的重要助手，同时又是乡镇领导科技工作的参谋和助手。他们常通过深入调查，对当地推广、普及科学技术存在的问题提出建议，不少建议还被当地党委、政府采纳。
    他们还针对乡镇经济的特点，引进、推广了一些实用科技，使不少群众受益。
    这个网络通过科技示范户的作用，发挥了“点亮一盏灯，照亮一大片”的示范效应。
    据昆明市科委最近对1986年建立的850户科技示范户的调查，这些科技示范户，约带动影响了周围的7600多户农民不同程度地走上了科技致富的道路。现在，昆明市还形成了92个科技示范村。
    昆明市近几年始终把农村科技网络作为一项重要的基础工作来抓。他们对科技干事采取择优招聘，科技示范户则坚持按条件推荐、审批的办法，分别制订了管理条例、明确规定各自职责、任务、待遇及奖惩办法。
    市科委还为科技干事建立了发展基金，并定期对科技干事、科技示范户进行考核、评比奖励。
