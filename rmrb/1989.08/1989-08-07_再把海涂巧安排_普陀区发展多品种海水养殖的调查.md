In recent years, one of the major bases for marine aquaculture in China, Putuo District of Zhejiang Province's Zhoushan City, has seen a rapid development in the aquaculture of multiple species such as sea cucumbers, abalones, and oysters. The total area for the cultivation of marine delicacies and multiple species has exceeded 7,000 mu (approximately 467 hectares, not including prawns), with an expected output value of over 6 million yuan for this year.

In the face of rising costs, tight feed supplies, declining production, and reduced profits in the marine aquaculture industry, how can the potential be tapped to improve the comprehensive utilization of tidal flats and overall economic benefits? The experience of Putuo District is refreshing.

**Inviting "Guests" with Technology**

Sea cucumbers, a famous marine delicacy from northern China, have had little to do with the eastern coastal regions in the past. In late October last year, the Putuo District Fishery Technology Promotion Station brought nearly 30,000 sea cucumber seedlings from Liaoning and tried cultivating them in a prawn pond on a local island. Due to the rich water quality and abundant bottom-dwelling diatoms in the pond, the seedlings grew to an average weight of over 20 grams and a length of more than 12 centimeters in less than seven months, even faster than in the north. In the second half of this year, they plan to bring in another 100,000 small sea cucumbers. Compared to sea cucumbers and bay scallops, which are native to the area, these "guests" have a much longer history! They come from the western Pacific, and have been living in Putuo for three years. Initially, these guests were not accustomed to the semi-mixed water life in the local sea area. Technicians worked hard to improve the conditions, and now they have gradually adapted. This year, the cultivation area for this type of scallop has expanded to 20 mu, with 15 mu in prawn ponds. According to a survey, in 1988, the average shell height of bay scallops co-cultivated with prawns reached 4.64 centimeters, and the meat yield rate was 14.2%, both higher than scallops cultivated in the north. A batch of them even entered the Hong Kong market.

The most precious marine product, abalone, has been separately cage-cultivated since it was brought here from Liaoning more than four years ago. At the beginning of this year, the district purchased more than 5,000 abalone "noble offspring" from the provincial marine research institute and tried co-cultivating them with kelp in cages. Currently, both the abalone and kelp are growing well. This success is of great significance for gradually forming a new pattern of marine aquaculture that combines algae, shellfish, and shellfish-algae.

**From Single to Diverse**

To change the situation of single species in marine aquaculture, multiple external (mainly international market) constraints, and the passive situation of "prospering with prawns and declining with prawns," the district has, based on successful trials, implemented vertical co-cultivation in 5,000 mu of prawn ponds this year. The former prawn-dominated ponds have become a new world where nearly 10 kinds of marine products such as mussels, razor clams, mud clams, Japanese oysters, Philippine clams, and croakers coexist.

Vertical co-cultivation in prawn ponds not only fully utilizes the water and mud layers but also, due to the different feeding habits of the organisms, consumes the residual feed and diatoms in the ponds, significantly improving the water quality and more conducive to the growth of shellfish and prawns. It is understood that the co-cultivation of shellfish and prawns can increase the yield of prawns by about 10 kilograms per mu, and the shellfish part can increase the output value by 300-400 yuan.

In 1988, Chen Jinshi, a farmer from Jizhi Village, Liuhengwuxing Township, leased 7 mu of prawn ponds for aquaculture, and just the mussels alone earned a profit of over 21,000 yuan. Pingjiao Township Salt Field used 80 square meters of tidal flats to release 15 kilograms of razor clam seedlings, and after more than three months of aquaculture, harvested over 600 kilograms of razor clams, with an output value of over 1,800 yuan.

**Establishing a Service System**

To solve the difficulties in developing multiple species vertical aquaculture, relevant departments in the district have worked hard to improve services in seedling sources, funds, materials, information, and other aspects, making some problems that individual households find difficult to solve easily resolvable.

For aquaculture of multiple marine species, the first problem to solve is the source of seedlings. The Putuo District Fishery Technology Promotion Station has organized personnel to transport seedlings of ark shells, scallops, mussels, and Philippine clams from Liaoning, Shandong, and other places, providing them to farmers in a timely manner. The Putuo District Marine Delicacy Aquaculture Development Company has also raised 600,000 yuan to build a marine delicacy seedling breeding ground. Last year, the first batch of 130,000 bay scallop seedlings was bred. This not only reduced the cost of seedlings but also avoided the high mortality rate of seedlings during long-distance transportation.

Kelp is a traditional mainstay of local aquaculture. Later, due to product backlog and sales difficulties, the aquaculture area sharply decreased, with only 170 mu in the entire district in 1986. To help fishermen restore this low-cost traditional product, relevant departments in the district timely understood the market situation, helped farmers order seedlings, supplied diesel, adjusted materials, and promoted products. Since last year, the Putuo District Marine Delicacy Aquaculture Development Company alone has provided 55,000 yuan in special loans for kelp to farmers. This year, the kelp output in the entire district can be more than double that of last year.

Good technical training and on-site guidance are important measures for developing multiple species aquaculture. In March 1987, when vertical aquaculture in prawn ponds was just starting, the district fishery technology promotion station held a special technical training class, enabling more than 60 professional farmers to systematically master the new technology. That year, the vertical aquaculture area in the entire district increased from 830 mu the previous year to 3,300 mu, with a total output value of nearly 2 million yuan. Last year, when bay scallops were promoted from small-scale trials to production aquaculture, relevant departments in the district also timely held special training classes, batch by batch popularizing aquaculture knowledge to fishermen, laying the foundation for expanding the aquaculture area.

    再把海涂巧安排
    ——普陀区发展多品种海水养殖的调查
     徐博龙
    近一两年，我国海水养殖重要基地之一的浙江省舟山市普陀区，出现了海参、鲍鱼、牡蛎等多品种立体化养殖业快步发展的好势头。全区海珍品及多品种养殖面积已超过7000亩（不包括对虾），今年预计可创产值600多万元。
    在海水养殖业成本提高、饵料紧张、生产滑坡、效益下降的情况下，如何挖掘内涵潜力，提高海涂综合利用和总体经济效益？普陀区的经验令人耳目一新。
            靠科技请“外客”落户
    生长在我国北方的著名海珍品海参，过去与东南沿海没有什么“缘份”。去年10月下旬，普陀区水产技术推广站从辽宁“请”来近3万头刺参苗，在本地一个海岛的对虾塘内试养。由于虾塘水质肥沃、底栖硅藻茂盛，参苗生长不到7个月，平均体重竟超过20克、体长12厘米以上，比在北方长得还快。今年下半年，他们将再“请来”10万头小刺参。相比海参、海湾扇贝的家乡就远多啰！它们来自美国西太平洋，到普陀落户已有3年。开初这些客人很不习惯在当地海区半混水生活。科技人员就千方百计改善条件，现在它们已经渐渐习惯了。今年，这种扇贝养殖面积扩大到20亩，其中有15亩是在对虾塘内。据调查，1988年与对虾混养的海湾扇贝平均壳高达4.64厘米，出鲜肉率达14.2％，均超过了我国北方养殖的扇贝，其中一批进入了香港市场。
    海产品中最珍贵的鲍鱼，从辽宁引到这里的4年多来，一直是单独笼养的。今年初，这个区从省海研所购进5000多只鲍鱼
  “贵子”，试着用笼子与海带一起套养。目前鲍鱼、海带长势都不错。这一成功，对逐步形成“以藻带贝，以贝促藻，贝藻结合”的海水养殖新格局有重要意义。
          由单一走向多样
    为了改变海水养殖业中品种单一，外界（主要是国际市场）制约因素多及“虾荣俱荣、虾衰百衰”的被动局面，这个区在试验成功的基础上，今年在5000亩虾塘实行立体混养。往日对虾的一统天下变成了毛蚶、缢蜻、泥蚶、日本真牡蛎、菲律宾蛤子、鲻鱼等近10种海产品共同生长的新天地。
    虾塘立体混养，不仅充分利用水体、泥层，而且由于生物的摄食作用不同，消耗了虾塘的残饵和硅藻类，虾塘水质明显提高，更有利于贝类、对虾的生长。据了解，贝类与对虾混养，每亩对虾可增产10公斤左右，贝类部分可增加产值300—400元。
    六横五星乡积峙村养殖户陈金世，1988年承包7亩虾塘养殖，仅毛蚶就盈利2.1万余元。平峧乡盐场利用80平方米滩面播放蜻苗15公斤，经3个多月养殖，起捕蜻子600余公斤，产值达1800余元。
      建立服务体系
    为了解决发展多品种立体化养殖业中的困难，该区有关部门努力在苗种、资金、物资、信息等多方面服务上下功夫，使一家一户难以解决的一些问题迎刃而解。
    养殖多品种海水产品，首先要解决苗种来源。普陀区水产技术推广站多次组织人员从辽宁、山东等地，调运贻贝、扇贝、毛蚶、菲律宾蛤仔等苗种，及时提供给养殖户。区海珍品养殖开发公司还筹集60万元建造海珍品育苗场，去年首批育出13万颗海湾扇贝幼苗。这不仅降低了种苗成本，而且避免了种苗在长途运输中死亡率高的问题。
    海带是当地水产养殖的传统当家品种，后来由于产品滞销积压，养殖面积急剧下降，1986年全区养殖面积仅170亩。为了帮助渔民恢复这一低成本的传统产品，区有关部门及时了解市场行情，帮助养殖户订购苗种，供应柴油，调剂物资，推销产品。去年以来，仅区海珍品养殖开发公司就向养殖户提供海带专项贷款5.5万元。今年，全区海带产量可比去年增长两倍多。
    搞好技术培训和现场辅导是发展多品种养殖的重要措施之一。1987年3月，对虾塘立体养殖刚刚起步，区水产科技推广站就举办了专项技术培训班，使60多养殖专业户较系统地掌握了新技术。当年，全区立体养殖面积就由上年的830亩猛增到3300亩，总产值近200万元。去年，海湾扇贝从小区试验向生产性养殖推广，区有关部门也及时举办了专题培训班，分批向渔民群众普及养殖知识，为扩大养殖面积打下了基础。
