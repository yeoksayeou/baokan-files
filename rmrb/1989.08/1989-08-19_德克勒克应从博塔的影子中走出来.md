On the night of August 14, South African President P.W. Botha, who had stubbornly clung to the apartheid system, faced a final showdown with the new leadership of the National Party, F.W. de Klerk, at a cabinet meeting. Botha was isolated and announced his resignation. The next day, de Klerk was elected by the cabinet to serve as acting president. The change in South Africa's top leadership may bring hope to the struggle against apartheid. However, due to the deep-rooted nature of South Africa's apartheid system, the oppressed black masses and organizations still need to continue their struggle until the South African government completely abandons its apartheid policies.

Since taking over as the highest leader of the National Party on August 3, de Klerk has shown clear differences with Botha in some policy proposals and actual actions. He once declared in parliament that the goal of the National Party is to build a completely new South Africa without any form of confrontation, dictatorship, and oppression. He also said, "The existing white rule system must be abolished." Whether these words can be fulfilled remains to be seen. From his subsequent decisions, it seems he still intends to take action in these areas. His agreement to meet with the chairman of the Frontline States, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, was a wise and welcomed move. Kaunda is one of the most resolute African leaders in opposing South Africa's apartheid policy. On August 10, he announced at the one-day summit of Frontline States leaders in the capital Lusaka that he would meet with de Klerk in the border city of Livingstone on August 28. Previously, at the Frontline States summit in Luanda on May 16, he proposed to hold talks with the new leader of the South African National Party, de Klerk, to discuss major political issues such as South Africa's political reforms and the creation of a free, democratic, and non-racial society. De Klerk's response to President Kaunda's proposal is his first step forward.

Whether de Klerk will continue on the path he has taken depends on his specific policy proposals and actions. After becoming acting president, he told reporters in Pretoria that the future government would give blacks a seat. However, in many respects, apartheid would continue to be implemented. He recently published a five-year plan that clearly stipulated this. De Klerk's decision is obviously far from his statements when he first took over the leadership of the National Party. This shows that he has no intention of completely abolishing the apartheid system that Botha had long stubbornly implemented. This has disappointed many. If de Klerk wants to be a leader who achieves something, he should make a decisive effort to step out of Botha's shadow and fulfill his promises.

    德克勒克应从博塔的影子中走出来
    本报记者　李景卫
    8月14日深夜，顽固坚持种族隔离制度的南非总统博塔与国民党新领导人德克勒克在内阁会议上进行最后的摊牌。博塔遭到孤立，宣布辞职。次日，德克勒克由内阁推举就任代总统。南非最高领导人的更迭可能会给反种族隔离斗争带来希望。但是，由于南非的种族隔离制度根深蒂固，深受歧视的南非黑人群众和组织还须继续坚持斗争，直到南非政府彻底放弃种族隔离政策。
    德克勒克自3日取代博塔担任国民党最高领导人以来，在一些政策主张和实际行动上与博塔有明显的分歧。他曾在议会宣布，国民党的宗旨是建立一个焕然一新的、没有任何形式的对抗、专制和压迫的南非。他还说：“现存的白人统治制度必须废止。”他的这些话能不能兑现暂且不论。从他后来作出的决定看，他还是打算在这些方面有所作为。他同意与前线国家主席、赞比亚总统卡翁达举行会晤是明智的举动，受到欢迎。卡翁达是反对南非种族隔离政策最坚决的非洲国家领导人。8月10日，他在首都卢萨卡举行的为期一天的前线国家首脑会议上宣布，他将于本月28日在边境城市利文斯通会晤德克勒克。在此之前，他曾于5月16日在罗安达举行的上一次前线国家首脑会议上建议与南非国民党新领导人德克勒克举行会谈，讨论南非的政治改革和创建一个自由、民主及无种族歧视的社会等重大政治问题。德克勒克能对卡翁达总统的建议予以响应，是他向前迈出的第一步。
    德克勒克是否会按照自己走出的路继续走下去，这要看他的具体政策主张和行动。担任代总统以后，他在比勒陀利亚对记者们说，在未来的政府中，将给黑人一个席位。但是，在许多方面，将继续实行种族隔离。他在最近公布了一份5年计划，在这份计划中还明确规定了这一点。德克勒克的这种决策显然与他刚接任国民党领导人时的说法相去甚远。由此可见，他并没有打算彻底废除博塔长期顽固推行的种族隔离制度。这一点使人们感到失望。如果德克勒克想作一名有所作为的领导人，就应该下决心从博塔的影子中走出来，兑现自己的诺言。
