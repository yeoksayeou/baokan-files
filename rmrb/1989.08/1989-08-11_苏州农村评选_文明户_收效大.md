Selection of "Civilized Households" in Suzhou Rural Areas Yields Significant Results

    BEIJING (Xinhua) -- How to address the prominent issues in rural social ethics and ensure that the tasks of building spiritual civilization are implemented in every household? Since this year, Suzhou City has launched the selection of "Civilized Households" (New Customs Households) from specific areas to the entire region, achieving good results.

    Suzhou's rural areas are relatively economically developed. However, in recent years, gambling and superstition have become prevalent in some villages, and issues such as students dropping out of school, abandoning farmland, illegally occupying residential land, and extravagant weddings and funerals have occurred from time to time. To effectively address these prominent problems, each county (city) has universally carried out pilot and promotion work for the selection of "Civilized Households" (New Customs Households).

    "Civilized Households" (New Customs Households) is an activity that everyone, young and old, cares about and participates in. In many villages, there are vivid examples of wives persuading husbands not to gamble and grandchildren urging grandmothers not to engage in superstition, forming a good atmosphere of family members mutually supervising each other and neighbors promoting each other.

    According to the Huangqiao Township government of Wuxian County, in the past, when village cadres encountered some difficulties, such as building beyond the approved area, students dropping out of school, abandoning farmland, and not implementing family planning measures, they often had to persuade endlessly, but the villagers still did not listen. Now, the village lists these prominent problems in the "ten absences" standard for "New Customs Households," allowing villagers to self-reflect and mutually supervise. Now, without the village cadres mobilizing, those who abandoned farmland go to replant, those who built beyond the approved area demolish their structures, students return to school, family planning measures are implemented, and criminal cases and civil disputes have significantly decreased.

    苏州农村评选“文明户”收效大
    本报讯  怎样解决当前农村社会道德风尚中的突出问题，使精神文明建设的任务落实到千家万户？今年以来，苏州市农村由点到面地开展了评选“文明户”（新风户）活动，收到了良好效果。
    苏州农村是经济较为发达的地区。然而，近年来一些乡村赌博、迷信活动盛行，在校生流失、抛荒耕地、多占宅基地、婚丧铺张等现象时有发生。为了切实解决这些突出问题，各县（市）普遍开展了评选“文明户”（新风户）的试点和推广工作。
    “文明户”（新风户）是一项男女老少都关心、千家万户都参加的活动，不少乡村出现了妻子劝丈夫不要赌博，孙子要祖母不搞迷信的生动事例，形成了家庭成员相互监督，邻里之间相互促进的良好风气。
    据吴县黄桥乡政府介绍，过去村干部遇到一些难题，如超面积建房、中小学流生、抛荒田、不落实计划生育措施等，往往是磨破嘴皮，群众还是不听。而现在，村里把这些突出问题列入“新风户”的“十无”标准，让村民自我对照，相互监督。现在不用村干部动员，谁家抛荒田自己去补种了，谁家超面积建房自己拆除了，流生返校读书了，计划生育措施也肯落实了，刑事案件、民事纠纷明显下降。
