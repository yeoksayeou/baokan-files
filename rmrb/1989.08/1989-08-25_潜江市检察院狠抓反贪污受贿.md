The Procuratorate of Qianjiang City in Hubei Province has been vigorously cracking down on corruption and bribery. From January to July this year, the procuratorate investigated and handled 31 cases of corruption and bribery involving 33 individuals, a 39% increase compared to the same period last year. Among these, there were 10 major cases, recovering economic losses for the state totaling over 450,000 yuan.

In handling these cases, the procuratorate focused on three main areas: First, it collaborated with the cleanup and rectification of companies, conducting thorough investigations into companies with chaotic financial management, severe losses, and strong public complaints. This effort uncovered 5 cases of economic crimes involving 5 individuals. Second, it collaborated with the financial and commercial rectification, uncovering 12 cases of corruption and bribery involving 13 individuals. Third, it concentrated its efforts on investigating cases of corruption and bribery exposed during the campaign for clean governance, uncovering 14 cases involving 15 individuals. For example, in July, during the city's campaign for clean governance, it was discovered that the manager of Zekou Coal Yard, Wu Jiyuan, had serious financial problems. The Procuratorate of Qianjiang City organized investigative personnel to work with the city's Bureau of Materials to conduct an investigation. Preliminary findings indicate that Wu Jiyuan, taking advantage of his position, colluded with others to amass illicit gains totaling 44,000 yuan. Recently, Wu has been arrested in accordance with the law.

    湖北潜江市人民检察院，今年1至7月共查处贪污受贿案31件，涉及33人，比去年同期上升39％，其中重大案件10起，为国家挽回经济损失45万余元。
    这个检察院在查处贪污受贿案件中，主要做了三件事：一是配合清理整顿公司工作，对财务管理混乱，亏损严重，群众反映强烈的那些公司认真清查，查出经济犯罪案5件5人；二是配合财贸整顿，挖出贪污受贿案12件13人；三是集中力量查处在廉政建设中揭露出来的贪污受贿案件14件15人，如今年7月市物资局在抓廉政建设中，发现泽口煤场主任吴家元有严重经济问题，潜江市人民检察院组织办案人员，会同市物资局进行调查，现初步查明，吴家元利用职务之便与人合伙，获不义之财4.4万元。日前，吴已被依法逮捕。
