Sun Jiqing, a tax official from the Xixiang Tax Office in Jintan County, has been diligently and impartially collecting taxes according to the regulations since he became the office head in 1979.

Xixiang Township is located in the northwest of Jintan County, bordering Danyang, Dantu, and Jurzhou counties. Tax collection work in this area is particularly challenging. In 1979, the county tax bureau sent Sun Jiqing back to his hometown to work. To ensure he could perform his duties without distraction, Sun Jiqing decided to stop drinking alcohol.

One day, Sun Jiqing's cousin requested a tax exemption certificate to set up a stall to repair watches in another city. Sun Jiqing replied, "You don't have a technical qualification certificate, so I can't issue it." On another occasion, Sun Jiqing discovered that a relative of his aunt's family was selling apples on the street without paying taxes and was quite rude. Sun Jiqing confiscated the relative's handbag and patiently explained the situation. Eventually, the relative paid the taxes according to the policy.

Some people said, "If Sun Jiqing just signs his name, the tax exemption application would be almost done. But he is too rigid." Indeed, Sun Jiqing's heavy pen never moves lightly. He always conducts thorough investigations and compares the situation with relevant policies. If it doesn't meet the criteria, he firmly refuses to sign. At the beginning of last year, the Credit Union applied for an exemption from the 6,000 yuan income tax they were supposed to pay each quarter. Sun Jiqing felt very conflicted. The tax office's work depends on the support of the Credit Union, and if relations between the two were strained, it would not be beneficial for future work. However, granting the exemption did not comply with the regulations. Therefore, he sincerely explained the situation to the Credit Union director, and in the end, the Credit Union willingly paid the full amount of taxes.

The brick and tile factory in Xixiang Township suffers significant losses every rainy season due to collapsed bricks, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. The factory requested a tax reduction. Sun Jiqing discovered during his investigation that the losses were due to poor management. He personally conducted experiments: by adding a few more bricks underneath and covering the bricks with oilcloth and straw mats, the bricks remained intact and did not get wet. Since then, the factory no longer requested tax reductions due to collapsed bricks. Last year, out of the 11 tax exemptions he approved, all complied with national policies.

Some people occasionally sent Sun Jiqing tea, melons, fish, and shrimp, hoping to influence him to pay less tax. Sun Jiqing understood their intentions and said, "These units and individuals send gifts to me because they see the power I hold." Sun Jiqing politely declined all gifts.

Sun Jiqing once ordered a set of furniture for his daughter at the township's woodworking factory, paying a deposit of 800 yuan. When it was time to settle the account, the factory only charged over 500 yuan. Sun Jiqing thought, "Although the seven pieces of furniture are ordinary, it's hard to buy them for over 500 yuan." He insisted on paying the full amount. When his daughter got married, many enterprises and individuals sent gifts such as quilts and pressure hot water bottles, all of which he returned. One factory director said, "Not accepting the gifts is disrespectful." Sun Jiqing replied, "I appreciate the sentiment, but I won't accept any gifts."

    权力关　金钱关　关关考验
    亲友事　自己事　事事公正
    ——记金坛县税务局干部孙吉庆
    金坛县税务局西肠乡税务组孙吉庆，从1979年任组长以来，秉公办事，照章收税。
    西肠乡在金坛县的西北，与丹阳、丹徒、句容三县为邻，税务工作比较难搞。1979年县税务局派孙吉庆回乡工作。为此，老孙特地戒了酒。
    一天，孙吉庆的表弟要求开张免税证明，到外地去摆摊修表。老孙说：“你没有技术合格证，我不能开。”又一次，孙吉庆发现舅舅家一亲戚未缴税就在街上摆摊卖苹果，态度还蛮横，就将他的手提包留下，并耐心做工作，结果舅舅按政策缴了税款。
    有人说：“减免税的申请只要老孙签个字，事情就算办成八九分，可他就是太死板。”是的，老孙的千斤重笔从不轻易下。他一要深入调查；二要对照有关政策，不该签的坚决不签。去年初，信用社提出免去每季应交的6000元所得税。对此，老孙感到很为难，税务组的业务需要信用社支持，两家关系如搞僵，不利于今后的工作，但要免税又不符合规定。于是他诚恳地同信用社主任说明道理，最后信用社痛快地如数纳了税。
    西肠乡砖瓦厂年年黄梅季节都要倒砖坯，损失几万元，厂方要求减税。老孙在调查中发现，这是管理不善造成的损失。他亲自做试验：在砖坯下面多垫二、三块砖，用油毛毡做成笠帽顶罩在砖坯上方，再披上草帘子，便可收到不渗水不倒砖坯的效果。从此，该厂再不喊倒坯要求减税了。去年经他审批的11项减免税，全部符合国家有关政策规定。
    有人不时向孙吉庆送茶、送瓜、送鱼虾等，想用钱物打动他，好少交点税。对此，老孙心里明白，他说：“这些单位和个人送礼给我，无非是看中了我手中的权。”老孙对送来的礼品，一概婉言谢绝。
    他曾在乡木器厂为女儿订做了一套家具，预付定金800元。结帐时，厂里只收500多元。老孙想：“7件家具虽属一般，但500多元也难买。”他坚持补足了钱。女儿结婚时，许多企业、个人纷纷送去毛毯、气压热水瓶等，他都一一退回。有位厂长说，不收就是不给面子。老孙回答：“情我领了，礼物一样不收。”
