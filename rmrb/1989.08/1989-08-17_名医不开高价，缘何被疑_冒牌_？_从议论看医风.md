Recently, a reporter passed by the East New Village Street Clinic in Shanghai's Putuo District and saw a crowd gathered around a "notice," discussing heatedly: "Two cents to see a specialist?!" "Is there really such a good deal?" "It must be a fake specialist!"

The reporter moved closer and saw that the notice read: "To alleviate the suffering of skin disease patients in this area and better serve the residents, our hospital has specially invited Professor Huang Zhengji from Huashan Hospital's Dermatology Department to set up a dermatology specialist clinic, charging the normal registration fee."

Huashan Hospital is one of the most famous hospitals in Shanghai, particularly renowned for its dermatology department. The notice was clear: a specialist doctor was invited to set up a clinic with normal registration fees, which should have been good news for local skin disease patients. Why then did people have doubts?

In recent years, large and medium-sized hospitals in Shanghai have generally added a "revenue generation" project: "specialist clinics" or "certain disease consultation centers." These clinics, staffed by specialist doctors, charge registration fees that are several times or even tens of times higher than normal. The public jokingly refers to this as seeing "priced diseases." People say, "Specialist clinics face south, if you have no money, don't come in," and the public has some complaints about this. No wonder when East New Village Street Clinic invited Professor Huang to charge normal registration fees, some people raised questions.

On August 6, Professor Huang held his first clinic at East New Village Street Clinic. That morning, a long line formed at the registration desk. The entire morning, this experienced specialist doctor did not rest. A female patient in her thirties said, "Really, for two cents, you can see a specialist clinic!"

A small street clinic did a big favor for the people, which is in stark contrast to those hospitals that set up "specialist clinics" to see "priced diseases" for the sake of "revenue generation." What do they feel? High medical ethics should be normal in our socialist country, but initially, people discussed this a lot. About this, it is not just the hospitals and doctors who need to "think about it."

### 名医不开高价，缘何被疑“冒牌”？  从议论看医风

    名医不开高价，缘何被疑“冒牌”？
    从议论看医风
    日前，记者从上海普陀区东新村街道医院门前经过，只见一群人在一张“告示”前议论纷纷：“两角钱能看专家医生？！”“有这档子好事情？”“怕是冒牌的专家吧？”
    记者凑上前去，但见“告示”上写道：“为解决本地区皮肤病患者的疾苦，更好地为居民服务，本院特聘请华山医院皮肤科黄正吉教授来院开设皮肤科专科门诊，按正常挂号收费。”
    华山医院是上海市最著名的医院之一，尤以皮肤科享誉全国。“告示”上写得清楚明白，特聘专科大夫而又按正常收费，本是此地皮肤病患者的福音，为何人们对此疑窦顿生？
    近年来，上海市大、中型医院，普遍增添了一个“创收”项目——“专家门诊”，或“某某病咨询中心”。这种集中专科医生开设的门诊，收取高出数倍甚至数十倍的挂号费，群众戏称为看“议价病”。人说，“专家门诊朝南开，有病无钱莫进来”，对此群众不无怨言。难怪东新村街道医院请来黄教授按正常挂号收费一举，反而有人提出疑问来。
    8月6日黄教授第一次在东新村街道医院为群众治病。这天大早，挂号处就出现了“长龙”。整整一个上午，这位有资历的专科大夫没有休息。一位30多岁的女病员说：“真的，花两角钱也能看上专家门诊了！”
    一家小小的街道医院，做了一桩大受群众欢迎的好事，相比之下，那些旨在“创收”而开设“专家门诊”看“议价病”的医院，作何感受？高尚的医德，在我们社会主义国家本属正常，开初人们却因此而议论纷纷，对此，该“想一想”的就不仅限于医院和医生了。
