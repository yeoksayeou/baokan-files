The Central Discipline Inspection Commission has organized 25 investigation teams to go to various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and relevant departments under the State Council to investigate and expedite cases. This is in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and based on the complaints and reports from the masses. Some of these cases are major cross-provincial incidents.

The Party Central Committee's policy of rectification and clean-up, as well as its resolve to combat corruption, has won the support of the people. The masses are deeply disgusted with the corrupt practices of some leading cadres and have been reporting and complaining to the Party's supervisory organs. In the first half of this year alone, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission received over 1,000 letters and visits from the masses regarding issues involving cadres at the prefecture level and above, a 39% increase compared to the same period last year. Of these, 654 were complaints and reports, accounting for 95%.

Among these complaints and reports, over 50% involved leading cadres abusing their power for personal gain and engaging in economic misconduct. This shows that the issues that the masses are most concerned about and strongly opposed to are still the corrupt practices of some Party members and cadres.

According to a relevant responsible person from the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the main issues reported by the masses include:

- Abusing power for personal gain, such as using public funds to send children to school or abroad, using public funds for medical treatment for family members, embezzling public property to build private houses, and using public funds for high-standard interior decoration, etc.

- Nepotism. Some leading cadres exploit loopholes in the cadre system reform to appoint their relatives, friends, and personal staff to important positions, regardless of whether they meet the "four modernizations" standards for cadres. To arrange positions, they either upgrade institutions in violation of regulations or forcefully appoint personnel despite overstaffing.

- Embezzlement, misappropriation of public funds and property, illegal business activities, speculation, accepting high-end gifts, and bribery, etc.

- Wasting public funds. For example, using the pretext of "learning from others" to engage in public-funded tourism, using public funds for banquets and gifts, etc.

The relevant responsible person from the Central Discipline Inspection Commission pointed out that these issues reported by the masses, once verified, will be seriously dealt with according to relevant regulations, regardless of who is involved.

    中纪委组织廿五个调查组  分赴各地调查和催办案件
    新华社北京8月28日电　（记者陈雁）记者从中共中央纪律检查委员会获悉，为贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神，根据群众的检举控告，中央纪委目前已组织25个调查组，分赴全国13个省、自治区、直辖市及中央国家机关有关部委，进行案件调查和催办工作，其中有些案件是跨省的大要案。
    党中央治理、整顿的方针和惩治腐败的决心，深得人民的拥护，广大群众对一些领导干部为政不廉的腐败现象深恶痛绝，纷纷向党内监督机关检举、控告。仅今年上半年，中央纪委就收到涉及地级以上领导干部问题的群众来信来访1000多件（次），与去年同期相比上升39％，其中属于检举控告性质的有654件（次），占95％。
    在以上检举控告信访中，反映领导干部以权谋私、经济上违纪违法问题的，占50％以上。可见，当前群众意见最大、反映最为强烈的依然是一些党员干部为政不廉等问题。
    据中纪委有关负责人介绍，群众反映的问题主要有：
    ——利用职权，谋取私利。如用公款送子女上学、出国；花公款为子女、家属看病；侵占公共财物建私房，用公款搞高标准内装修等。
    ——任人唯亲。一些领导干部钻人事制度改革的空子，乘机将自己的亲朋好友、身边的工作人员等，不论是否具备干部“四化”标准，均委以要职。为安排职位，或违反规定将机构升格；或不顾人员超编硬性安排。
    ——贪污、贪占公款公物，违法经商，进行倒买倒卖活动，接受高档礼品，收受贿赂等。
    ——挥霍、浪费严重。如以“取经”为名，实际上搞公费旅游；用公款吃喝、送礼等。
    中央纪委有关负责人指出，对于群众检举控告的这些问题，一经查实，不论是谁，都要按照有关规定严肃进行处理。
