According to statistics from the Italian police, in the Italian capital of Rome, a total of 18,707 cars were stolen in the first seven months of this year alone. On average, nearly 2,700 cars are stolen each month, 90 cars per day, and 1 car every 15 minutes. Additionally, there are about twice as many cases of theft involving car radios, spare tires, entire sets of tires, and valuable items left in the car.

The methods and purposes of car theft are varied. The first type is so-called "borrowing," mostly involving small cars. These cars have easily opened doors and few anti-theft devices. Often, drug addicts steal cars to get home. The second type is for robbery, where thieves target fast and agile cars to facilitate their crimes. The third type is for resale, often involving high-end cars, which are either sold in parts or stolen and immediately modified and disguised—re-painted, license plates changed, etc.—before being resold.

Additionally, there are those who fake car thefts to claim insurance. Car owners collude with scrapyards or mechanics to sell the car in parts, and then report the car as stolen to the insurance company a few days later to receive compensation. These fraudsters often appear to be "respectable gentlemen," making them less suspicious, but the Italian police have accumulated many effective methods to deal with such fraud. Several months ago, the Italian police in Rome busted a fraud ring. This ring used forged documents to transport large quantities of high-end Mercedes-Benz, Lancia-Delta, and SUVs to West Germany, Japan, and the United States, selling them at high prices, while reporting these cars as "stolen" in Italy. This ring smuggled over 2,000 high-end sedans, each selling for an average of 30 million lire, amassing a fortune. However, they ultimately did not escape their tragic fate.

    罗马车盗多
    据意大利警方统计，在意大利首都罗马，仅今年头7个月，共丢失汽车18707辆，平均每月丢失近2700辆，每天90辆，每1刻钟1辆。另外盗窃汽车里的收放机、备用轮胎甚至整套轮胎以及放在车座上的贵重物品的案件还要多1倍。
    据分析，盗窃汽车的手段和目的多种多样：第一种是所谓“偷用”，多为小型车，这些车车门易开，且很少有防盗装置，往往是吸毒者为回家而偷用别人的汽车；第二种是为抢劫用，抢劫者专偷速度快而又灵活的汽车，以便行抢；第三种是为了倒卖，多偷高档车，或拆成零件出售，或偷车后立即加以改造和伪装——重新喷漆、换车牌等，然后倒卖。
    此外，还有假冒丢车而向保险公司索赔者，车主与废车站或机械师串通一气，把汽车拆成零件卖掉，数日后即向保险公司申报丢车并获赔款。这种骗子多为表面上的“正人君子”，不易令人怀疑，但意大利宪兵对付这种行骗手段已经积累了许多有效的办法。数月前，意大利宪兵即在罗马破获了一个行骗集团，这个集团用伪造的证件把大批的高档奔驰、兰恰—戴马、越野车等运往西德、日本、美国等地高价出售，而在意大利申报这些汽车“失窃”。这个集团用这种办法偷运了两千多辆高级小轿车，平均每辆售价3000万里拉，大发横财，但最终没有能逃脱其可悲的下场。　·晋标·（本报罗马8月12日电）
