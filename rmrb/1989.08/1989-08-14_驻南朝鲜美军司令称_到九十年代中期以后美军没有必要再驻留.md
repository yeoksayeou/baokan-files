Commander of U.S. Forces in South Korea Says No Need for U.S. Troops to Remain After Mid-1990s

	NEW YORK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the U.S. "New York Times" today, General Menetre, the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, said in an interview on August 9 that after the mid-1990s, U.S. troops would no longer need to remain in South Korea.

	Menetre said that South Korea has formulated a plan to modernize its military, including the addition of 120 new fighter jets, and its economy will continue to develop. He believes that if this trend continues, South Korea will be able to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula without U.S. presence by the mid-1990s.

	Menetre's remarks are seen as a significant shift in the U.S. stance on the issue of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.

	President Bush had previously stated on July 24 to the visiting South Korean Foreign Minister that the U.S. had no intention of withdrawing its troops from South Korea. It is reported that the U.S. Department of Defense has begun reviewing the role of U.S. troops in Asia and is focusing on discussions regarding the stationing of troops in South Korea.

    驻南朝鲜美军司令称
    到九十年代中期以后美军没有必要再驻留
    新华社华盛顿8月13日电  据美国《纽约时报》今天报道，驻南朝鲜美军司令梅尼特里将军9日在接受采访时表示，到90年代中期以后，美国军队将没有必要继续留驻南朝鲜。
    梅尼特里说，南朝鲜方面制定了实现军队现代化的计划，包括增加120架新式战斗机，而且其经济也将不断得到发展。他认为如果这种趋势继续下去的话，那么到90年代中期，没有美国也能维持朝鲜半岛的稳定。
    梅尼特里的这番谈话被认为是美国在南朝鲜驻军问题上的重大立场变化。
  布什总统曾于7月24日对来访的南朝鲜外交部长说，美国无意撤走驻扎在南朝鲜的美国军队。据悉，美国防部目前已开始审议美军在亚洲的作用等问题，并集中讨论在南朝鲜的驻军问题。
