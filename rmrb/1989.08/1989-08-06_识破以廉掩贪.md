Title: Seeing Through the Mask of Frugality to Expose Greed

A certain individual sought the help of a powerful figure, intending to "clear the path" by offering a few hundred yuan as a "gesture of goodwill." To his surprise, this offer was angrily rejected. Later, after being enlightened by someone experienced in such matters, he realized that the issue was "not that it was unwanted, but that it was too little." So, he increased the amount to a thousand yuan, and sure enough, the matter was smoothly resolved. It is said that this powerful figure was even a "role model of clean governance" in the local area.

This is a piece of hearsay, and the author cannot verify its authenticity; perhaps it is an exaggeration. However, it is true that there are instances of "clean officials" who are not genuinely clean.

Why do some "clean officials" fail to convince people of their integrity? One cannot help but acknowledge that some individuals are quite "clever" in this regard, adept at playing two roles. They may be clean in one matter but greedy in another, clean one day but greedy the next, clean with acquaintances but greedy with strangers, clean with small gifts but greedy with large ones. Sometimes, even when they clearly find the gift too small, they will still put on a show, criticizing and even suggesting an exhibition of the gift, appearing very "clean." But as long as the gift meets their expectations, they will accept it with a smile. Such "clean officials" are false, and their "cleanliness" is merely a cover for greed, with the true intention still being greed. If such people are regarded as "clean officials," then clean governance will become a joke.

Therefore, when evaluating cadres, one must not merely look at the surface or a single instance. When selecting and commending clean officials, transparency must be increased, and opinions from all sectors of society must be fully solicited to facilitate public supervision. We must not allow false "clean officials" to appear on the honor roll, tarnishing the reputation of clean governance.

    识破以廉掩贪
    毛志远
    某君有求于一位实权人物，为“疏通道路”，先以数百元“意思意思”，不料被愤然拒之。尔后，经长于此道者“点拨”，方知“不是不要，而是嫌少”。于是便加码到千元，果然应验，事情顺不溜地“办”了。据悉，这位实权人物还是当地的“廉政标兵”呢。
    这是听来的消息，笔者无法核实，也许言过其实了。但是，“廉政标兵不廉洁”的事情，确实是有的。
    为什么有的“廉吏”并不能令人信服呢？不能不承认，在这个问题上，有些人很是“高明”，善于演两种角色，此事廉而彼事贪，今日廉而明日贪，亲者廉而疏者贪，轻礼廉而重礼贪。有时明明嫌礼轻，还要故作姿态，又是批评又是要展览礼品，“廉洁”得可以，但只要礼品合心，便笑而纳之。这种“廉吏”是虚假的，而这种“廉”是为了掩盖贪，真正的目的还是贪。如果把这种人当作“廉吏”，廉政便会成为笑话。
    因此，在考察干部时，决不能只看表面或一时一事。在评选表彰廉洁干部时，更要增加透明度，充分征求社会各界意见，以利群众监督。切莫让假“廉吏”登上光荣榜，玷污了廉政的美名。
