	Asia's Largest Marshalling Yard
	How grand! How magnificent!—On what was once barren land, Asia's largest freight car marshalling yard—Zhengzhou North Marshalling Yard—has now been built. Here, there are 253 train lines, with a daily marshalling capacity of 22,300 cars. The entire yard has established an electronic computer freight car management information system. Trains are rearranged and combined here, reaching as far south as Guangzhou, as far north as Shanhaiguan, as far east as Shanghai Nanxiang, and as far west as Chengdu and Lanzhou. It truly deserves to be called the hub of the country's railways and the heart of transportation.

    亚洲最大的编组站
    何待恢宏！何等壮观！——在昔日的荒地上，如今已建成亚洲最大的货车编组站——郑州北编组站。这里，共有列车线路253条，日编组列车能力达22300辆，全站已建立起电子计算机货车管理信息系统。列车在这里改编、组合，南可达广州，北可达山海关，东可达上海南翔，西可达成都、兰州。它，不愧为祖国铁路的枢纽、交通的心脏。
