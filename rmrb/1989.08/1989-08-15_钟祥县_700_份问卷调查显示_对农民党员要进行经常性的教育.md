Recently, we conducted a sample survey of 700 farmer party members in the entire county. In the questionnaire survey, 310 party members said that their current main concern is getting rich; over 460 party members believe that the most popular people among the masses are those with skills; 343 party members think that the main content of farmer party member education should be wealth-creation skills. Some rural party members cannot withstand the impact of the commodity economy, leading to a decline in their ideology. Some worship money, doubt the ultimate goal of the Party; some introduce the principle of equivalent exchange into the Party, haggle over the distribution of work in the branch; some even haggle over participating in organizational life, and some use their work to seek personal gain.

According to the survey, among these 700 party members, 47% have a per capita household income of over 700 yuan, and 72% of party member households have savings. Therefore, most party members believe that the Party's policies have provided a good social environment for rural party members to get rich. However, some party members still have various doubts and concerns. Some think that current issues such as price increases, poor Party discipline, and social disorder are results of the reform, and thus doubt the future of the reform.

Currently, farmer party members are very concerned about the major issues of the Party and the country. Among the 460 party members surveyed, the most concerned issue is the future of the Party and the reform, and the most discussed topics are Party discipline and social order. At the same time, they pay close attention to the work of the village party branch and the village committee. However, in some places, almost every party member has complaints. They are very disgusted with the poor Party discipline, worried about social order, and indignant about unfair distribution, but feel powerless. Most party members think that this is caused by certain policies and the lack of enforcement from higher levels.

Most farmer party members have deep feelings for the Party. Regardless of age or education level, they are willing to do practical things for the collective and the masses and make contributions. In the survey, 630 people answered that they think most about doing practical things for the masses. The vast majority of party members expressed that they want to add luster to the Party flag with their actual actions. However, some party members feel that they cannot play a role, which is reflected in their lack of initiative at work and adherence to old ways.

The mainstream of farmer party members' thoughts is positive and upward, but it is accompanied by negative phenomena. This is caused by various factors. We believe that party organizations at all levels should take measures to wholeheartedly care for and cherish farmer party members, actively help them solve ideological problems, and inspire the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of party members, so that they can better play the role of party members.

    钟祥县700份问卷调查显示——
    对农民党员要进行经常性的教育
    最近，我们对全县700名农民党员进行了抽样调查。在问卷调查中，有310名党员认为，当前想得最多的是发家致富；460多名党员认为，当前最受群众欢迎的是有技术的人；343名党员认为，农民党员教育的主要内容应是致富技术，有些农村党员经不住商品经济的冲击，思想滑坡。有的崇尚拜金主义，对党的最终目标持怀疑态度；有的把等价交换的原则引入党内，对支部分配的工作讨价还价；有的参加组织生活也讲价钱，有的还利用工作之便谋取私利。
    据调查，这700名党员家庭人均收入700元以上的占47％，72％的党员家庭有存款。因此，大多数党员认为，党的政策给农村党员致富提供了一个良好的社会环境。但是，少数党员还存在各种困惑疑虑，有的认为，当前存在的物价上涨、党风不正和社会秩序不好等问题是改革带来的，因而对改革的前景持怀疑态度。
    目前，农民党员都十分关心党和国家的大事。被抽查的460名党员当前最关心的是党的前途和改革的前景，议论最多的是党风和社会治安问题。同时，他们对本村党支部和村委会的工作极为关注。然而，在有些地方，几乎每个党员都有牢骚。他们对党风不正非常反感，对社会治安忧心忡忡，对分配不公愤愤不平，却又感到无能为力。多数党员认为，这是某些政策和上面抓得不力造成的。
    大多数农民党员对党有着深厚的感情，无论年龄大小、文化高低，都愿为集体和群众办实事，作贡献。调查中，630人回答：他们想得最多的是为群众办实事。绝大多数党员表示，要用自己的实际行动为党旗增添光彩。但是，有一些党员感到无法发挥作用，这表现在工作不思进取，墨守成规。
    农民党员的思想主流是积极向上的，同时伴生着消极现象。这是由多方面原因造成的。我们认为各级党组织应采取措施，满腔热情地关心和爱护农民党员，积极地帮助他们解决思想问题，激励广大党员的政治热情，使之更好地发挥党员的作用。
