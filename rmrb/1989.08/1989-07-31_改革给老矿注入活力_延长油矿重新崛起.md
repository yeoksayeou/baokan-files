Ten years of reform have injected new life into China's oldest oilfield—Shanxi Yanchang Oilfield. This mine, which has a history of over 80 years, produced a total of only 400,000 tons of oil in its first 70 years. However, in 1979, it produced 400,000 tons in one year, and by 1985, this figure had risen to 1.5 million tons. In the first half of this year, the oilfield produced 1.46 million tons of oil, processed 1.52 million tons of crude oil, and achieved a profit and tax revenue of over 36 million yuan.

Yanchang Oilfield is a key enterprise in the Yan'an region with comprehensive production capabilities including drilling, oil extraction, and refining. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, relevant departments have formulated a series of special policies for the oilfield, such as fixed oil production quotas, profit caps for turnover, and using all surplus production and profits above the cap as exploration and development funds for the oilfield. This has solved the problem of insufficient development funds for the oilfield. Subsequently, the oilfield implemented a series of reforms, including "input-output contracts" and "tonnage pricing for oil purchases," gradually implementing the economic responsibility system.

Relevant officials believe that the resurgence of Yanchang Oilfield has become a "treasure trove" for the fiscal revenue of the Yan'an region, playing an important role in quickly changing the impoverished face of northern Shaanxi.

    改革给老矿注入活力
    延长油矿重新崛起
    本报西安7月31日电　记者景险峰报道：十年改革给我国最老的油矿——陕西延长油矿注入活力。这座已有80多年历史的老矿，前70年石油产量总共只有40万吨，而1979年一年就采油4万吨，1985年达到15万吨。今年上半年采油量达14.6万吨，原油加工量15.2万吨，实现利税3600多万元。
    延长油矿是延安地区一家具有钻井、采油、炼油等综合生产能力的骨干企业。党的十一届三中全会以来，有关部门为这个矿制定了一系列特殊政策，如原油产量包干、利润限额上交、超产收入和超限额利润全部作为油矿勘探开发基金等，解决了油矿开发资金不足的难题。接着，又在油矿实行“投入产出包干，吨油计价收购”等一系列改革，层层落实经济承包责任制。
    有关人士认为，延长油矿的重新崛起，成为延安地区财政收入的“聚宝盆”，对尽快改变陕北贫困面貌具有重要意义。
