    工业在艰苦奋斗中崛起
    经过40年艰苦努力，江西工业面貌焕然一新。
    一个门类比较齐全、初具规模的工业体系已经建立，到1988年，全省拥有煤炭、钢铁、机械、电力、医药、建材、有色金属、电子、食品、纺织、造纸、化工等39个工业行业，17911个企业，其中31个行业有大中型企业，实现利税超千万元甚至上亿元的企业逐年增多。一些重要的工业产品，大中型企业的产量占80％以上。这些“明星”企业总产值占全省的39.2％，利税总额占全省的53.4％。全国规模最大、产量最多的江西铜基地，“六五”期间已建成投产。冶金工业的炼钢轧材能力现已名列全国23个有地方小钢铁省市的第4位。工业部门提供的利税，占全省财政收入的3／4。
    40年的艰苦奋斗，江西工业为社会提供的产品从少到多，从低到高，不断发展。近几年，江西创造出一大批在国内外市场有竞争能力的“拳头”产品。1979年至1988年，全省工业产品共荣获国家金、银质奖82个，获部优产品奖604个，省优产品奖1812个。在首届北京国际博览会轻工产品评比中，江西又获13枚金牌。日用瓷、凤凰牌照相机、飞鱼牌自行车、余江雕刻、草珊瑚牙膏、鸭鸭牌羽绒制品、四特酒、铅精矿、三牙钻头、拖拉机、柴油机等名优特产品，畅销国内外。　　（王军　胡斌）
