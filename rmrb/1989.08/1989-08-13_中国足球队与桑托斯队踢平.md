    新华社大连8月12日电　（记者赵昌春、通讯员元洪斌）球迷们盼望已久的中国国家足球队与巴西桑托斯队的比赛今晚在足球城大连进行，双方精采的表演使3.6万多名观众大饱眼福，结果双方以1∶1握手言和。
    中国队摆出四四二阵容，巴西队由苏格拉底率领，以四三三对阵。比赛一开始，双方展开对攻战，比赛进行到8分钟时，2号朱波在右路传中，贾秀全头球摆渡，马林快速赶上，一个狮子甩头把球送入网窝。下半时开赛7分钟，苏格拉底带球突入禁区，裁判员判中国队员犯规被罚点球；苏格拉底主罚命中，把比分扳平。
    随后，双方进攻更趋白热化，巴西队为取得比赛的胜利，全力以赴发动进攻，中国队以攻对攻，双方场上犯规次数增多，裁判员共6次出示黄牌。尽管比赛高潮迭起，但直到终场，双方都未能再进球。
