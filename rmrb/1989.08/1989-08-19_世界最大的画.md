The world's largest oil painting has appeared in Hamburg, West Germany. This massive artwork, measuring 250 meters in length and 13.5 meters in width, with a total area of 3,375 square meters, was created to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the opening of Hamburg Port. The entire painting is displayed on the outer wall of the 10th floating dock of a shipyard on the Elbe River.

The creator and chief designer of this painting is the 48-year-old artist Roland Steigmann. He spent one and a half years preparing, meticulously researching extensive materials related to Hamburg Port and visiting museums to observe historical artifacts. He then sketched the outline, depicting the changes in Hamburg Port since 1189, from the oldest tugboats to modern container ships, leaving nothing out.

On December 7, 1988, this massive project officially began. Steigmann first enlarged the sketch to scale and drew it on the dock wall. He then hired eight skilled painters to paint according to the specified colors. The painting took a full five months to complete, using a total of 5,000 liters of various colored paints. The costs were sponsored by several public and private enterprises.

Standing on the opposite bank of the 180-meter-wide Elbe River, one can vaguely see thousands of ancient and modern ships gathered in one place. Steigmann said his masterpiece will definitely be included in the 1989 edition of the "Guinness Book of World Records."

    世界最大的画
    一幅世界上最大的油漆画已经在联邦德国的汉堡港出现。这幅长250米，宽13.5米，总面积3375米的巨画是为了纪念汉堡港开港800周年而创作的。整幅画被涂在易北河边一家造船厂的第10号浮船坞外壁上。
    这幅画的创造者和总设计师是48岁的画家罗兰德·斯台格曼。他用了1年半的时间进行准备，仔细查阅了大量有关汉堡港的史料并到博物馆参观许多历史实物。然后绘出草图，描写自1189年以来汉堡港的变化，从最古老的拉纤木船到现代的集装箱货轮无所不包。
    1988年12月7日，这项巨大工程正式开始。斯台格曼首先将草图按比例放大，画在船坞壁上。他雇了8名有较高技术的油漆工人按指定的色彩涂刷。巨画用了整整5个月才完成，共耗各色油漆5000升。所需费用由若干公私企业赞助。
    站在180米宽的易北河对岸，人们可以恍惚看见千百艘古今船只聚集于一处。斯台格曼说他的这幅巨制肯定会载入1989年的《吉尼斯世界纪录大全》。　（陈封）
