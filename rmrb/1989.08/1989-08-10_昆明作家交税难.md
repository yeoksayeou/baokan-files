Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 9th

A young writer from the creation team of a unit stationed in Kunming has repeatedly informed reporters that it is difficult to pay taxes in Kunming. He earned several thousand yuan in royalties last year, but despite multiple visits to the tax authorities, he has been unable to pay the personal income adjustment tax into the national treasury.

After receiving this royalty in August last year, the young writer visited the municipal, district tax bureaus, and the tax office in his area. However, from the bureau to the office, from one office to another, the responses were surprisingly uniform: "We don't know who should collect it," "We've never collected it before," "We don't know how to collect it."

After the media exposed Mao Aimin's tax evasion for "performing outside of official channels," the young writer visited the tax bureau again. An official instructed him to find the tax officer in charge of individual taxpayers. However, after checking all the documents, the officer still couldn't determine the tax rate. After consulting, the tax was finally collected at a rate of 20%, one year late, and the writer was told: "We'll collect it this way for now, and we'll adjust it later if the tax rate is clarified."

Everyone says it's hard to collect taxes, but who would have thought it's also hard to pay taxes? Through this writer's experience, the reporter believes that at least two serious issues are reflected:

First, since the personal income adjustment tax was introduced, an unknown amount of tax revenue has likely been lost. Second, the tax authorities don't know who should collect the tax on income from books and paintings, or how much should be collected. What is the root cause of this problem?

    昆明作家交税难
    新华社昆明八月九日电（记者段建勋）驻昆明部队创作室一位青年作家多次向记者反映，在昆明市交税难。他去年写书得了数千元稿酬，可是多次找税务部门，也没能将个人收入调节税交入国库。
    这位青年作家去年八月得到这笔稿酬后，跑遍了市、区税务局和所在地区的税务所，谁知从局到所，从这间办公室出又进那一间办公室，回答却大出人意外：“不知道该由谁收”、“过去没收过”、“不知道怎么收”。
    毛阿敏“走穴”偷漏税被报刊披露后，这位青年作家再访税务局。一位负责人让他去找管理个体户税收的专管员。可是专管员查阅了全部文件，也弄不清税率是多少。经请示，最后按百分之二十的税率收了这笔迟收一年的税款，并告诉作家：“先这么收了，以后明确税率再多退少补。”
    世人都说收税难，谁知还有交税难。透过这位作家交税难，记者认为起码折射出了两个严峻的问题：
  一是自开征个人收入调节税以来，不知漏收了多少税款。二是税务部门竟不知道书画收入所得税该由谁收、收多少，症结何在？
