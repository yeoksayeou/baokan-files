Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun expressed that China is willing to further develop friendly cooperative relations with the United Nations organization during his meeting with United Nations guests tonight.

He pointed out during the meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse with the Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Domingo L. Suarez, that foreigners must understand China from the following three fundamental aspects:

First, the leadership position of the Communist Party of China in China will not change, and no political force can replace the Communist Party of China to govern such a large country;

Second, China's specific national conditions determine that China can only follow the socialist path, with no other alternatives;

Third, the reform and opening-up policy is China's fundamental policy and will not change.

Tian Jiyun said that to achieve the Four Modernizations, China must implement the reform and opening-up policy, and closing the country off is not an option.

During the conversation, Tian Jiyun praised the contributions made by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in promoting economic cooperation between the North and the South and between the South and the South.

Suarez told Tian Jiyun that he would convey the message that China's reform and opening-up policy will not change to his colleagues.

Suarez arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon to discuss with the Chinese side the establishment of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization Beijing Center, which aims to promote international industrial cooperation. According to an official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the main tasks of the Beijing Center are to promote industrial enterprise cooperation, investment activities, and technological exchanges between the North and the South and between the South and the South. Similar centers have already been established in eight cities, including Cologne, Vienna, Milan, Paris, and Warsaw.

After arriving in Beijing, Suarez was received by Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Zeng Tuobin, and held talks with Vice Minister Shen Jueren. Director-General Suarez will leave China tomorrow.

    田纪云会见联合国客人
    新华社北京8月22日电  （记者周慈朴）田纪云副总理今晚在会见联合国客人时表示，中国愿意进一步发展同联合国组织的友好合作关系。
    他在钓鱼台国宾馆会见联合国工业发展组织总干事小多明戈·夏松时指出，外国人要认识中国，就必须从以下三个基本方面来观察：
    一、中国共产党在中国的领导地位是不会改变的，没有任何政治力量能够替代中国共产党来治理中国这样的大国；
    二、中国具体国情决定，中国只能走社会主义道路，别无其他出路；
    三、改革开放政策是中国的基本国策，也是不会改变的。
    田纪云说，中国要实现四个现代化，就必须执行改革开放政策，闭关锁国是不行的。
    在交谈中，田纪云赞扬联合国工业发展组织在推动南北和南南之间经济合作所作出的贡献。
    夏松对田纪云说，他将把中国改革开放政策不会改变这一信息转告他的同事。
    夏松今天中午乘飞机抵达北京，前来同中国方面商谈筹建旨在促进国际工业合作的联合国工业发展组织北京中心事宜。据中国经贸部一位官员介绍，北京中心的主要任务是促进南北和南南之间的工业企业合作、投资活动和技术交流。类似这样的中心已在科隆、维也纳、米兰、巴黎、华沙等8个城市建立。
    夏松抵京后，中国经贸部部长郑拓彬会见了他，副部长沈觉人同他举行了会谈。夏松总干事将于明天离开中国。
