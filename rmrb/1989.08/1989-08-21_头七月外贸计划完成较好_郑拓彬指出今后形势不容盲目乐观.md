    The first seven months of the foreign trade import and export plan have been completed well. Zheng Tuobin points out that the future situation is not to be blindly optimistic.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21st (reporter Jiang Jun) Minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission Zheng Tuobin announced today that the import and export plan for the first seven months of this year has been completed well. He also pointed out that the situation facing us in the future is not to be blindly optimistic.

    Zheng Tuobin said, as of August 10th, the cumulative export value of the country has completed 66% of the annual plan, an increase of 0.6% over the same period last year. In the composition of export commodities, the proportion of industrial manufactured goods has further increased, the proportion of primary products has decreased, and especially the export of some bulk primary products has significantly decreased compared to the same period last year. The situation of import plan completion is also good. From January to July, the country's imports have completed 56.6% of the annual plan, an increase of 10.7% over the same period last year. The import situation of important materials such as grain, pesticides, fertilizers, and steel is good.

    He pointed out that to complete the full-year import and export plan, the task for the next four and a half months is still arduous, and the situation is not to be blindly optimistic. From the international environment, China's foreign economic and trade work is facing some complex situations where some Western countries are implementing so-called "economic sanctions" against us. On the other hand, the current international market is active in buying and selling, which is beneficial for our export development. Domestic industrial and agricultural production is stable, and the initial effects of rectification and economic adjustment have been achieved, which is also an important guarantee and foundation for us to further do a good job in foreign trade and increase exports.

    头七月外贸计划完成较好
    郑拓彬指出今后形势不容盲目乐观
    据新华社北京8月21日电　（记者姜军）国家经贸部部长郑拓彬今天在此间宣布，今年前七个月的外贸进出口计划已较好地完成。他同时指出，今后面临的形势不容盲目乐观。
    郑拓彬说，截至8月10日，全国累计出口额已完成年计划的66％，比去年同期增长0.6％。在出口商品构成中，工业制成品的比重进一步上升，初级产品比重下降，特别是一些大宗初级产品的出口，比去年同期大幅度减少。进口计划完成年情况也比较好，1至7月份，全国进口已完成年计划的56.6％，比去年同期增加10.7％。粮食、农药、化肥、钢材等重要物资的进口情况良好。
    他指出，要圆满完成全年的进出口计划，以后四个多月的任务还很艰巨，形势不容盲目乐观。从国际环境看，我国对外经贸工作面临着一些西方国家对我实行所谓“经济制裁”的复杂情况。但另一方面，目前国际市场购销活跃，对我们发展出口仍然是有利的，国内工农业生产平稳发展，治理整顿、经济调整取得初步成效，这也是我们进一步做好外贸工作、增加出口的重要保证和基础。
