Nigeria's road traffic accidents are extremely severe. On the national highways, an average of more than seven thousand people die each year. Most of these accidents are caused by public bus drivers. They drive as if they are participating in a race, chasing each other, overtaking recklessly, and refusing to yield. To improve traffic safety, Nigeria's public transportation department recently formulated a series of measures, including a regulation that the maximum speed should not exceed one hundred kilometers per hour. However, some drivers still ignore these rules and do as they please. Therefore, the Federal Road Safety Commission of Nigeria announced: starting from February this year, there will be strict inspections every month. Any driver found to have caused an accident due to a serious traffic violation will have their driving license permanently revoked.

    尼日利亚：严惩违章司机
    尼日利亚的公路交通事故非常严重。在全国的公路干线上，平均每年有七千多人丧生。大部分事故是由公共汽车司机造成的。他们开车像是参加赛车，你追我赶，强行超越，互不相让。为改善交通安全情况，尼日利亚公交部门前不久制定了一系列措施，其中规定最高时速不得超过一百公里。但仍有一些司机置若罔闻，我行我素。为此，尼日利亚交通安全联邦委员会宣布：从今年二月开始，每月都要严加盘查，凡违章肇事、情节严重的汽车司机，一经查出，都将被永远剥夺驾驶的权利。
