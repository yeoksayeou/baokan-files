Even experts like Zhou Xingjia, who have long studied the deserts of Xinjiang, were astonished to find expanses of soil flats in the heart of the Taklamakan Desert. When these grayish-yellow soil flats came into view amidst the vast desert, the deputy researcher was filled with joy and surprise.

This is the first time Chinese scientists have discovered soil deposits in this desert.

Last November, a desert research team traveling from south to north across the Tarim River found several soil platforms nestled in a flat and wide ancient riverbed in the northern part of the desert. The largest of these flats cover tens of square kilometers, while the smallest are a few hundred square meters, like isolated islands in a sea of sand. These soil flats follow the curves of the ancient river, generally located in the still-water areas of the ancient Tarim River, standing about 50 centimeters high, with sparse vegetation growing on them.

Previously, both domestic and foreign explorers in the desert interior had only seen sand, with no soil in sight. In recent years, some scientists have discovered wind-blown sandy soil on the gravel layers around the desert.

Why have these soil flats, surrounded by sand dunes, managed to survive millions of years of wind and sand erosion without being swallowed by the sand?

This remains a mystery for desert experts.

### 塔克拉玛干腹地发现土质平地

    塔克拉玛干腹地发现土质平地
    新华社乌鲁木齐8月10日电　（记者申尊敬）就连长期研究新疆沙漠的沙漠专家周兴佳也没想到，塔克拉玛干沙漠腹地还有面积不小的土质平地。当一块块灰黄色土质平地在大漠里映入这位副研究员的眼帘时，他惊喜异常。
    这是我国科学工作者在这块沙漠腹地首次发现土质堆积。
    去年11月，沙漠科考队由南向北穿越塔里木河考察时，在沙漠北部的一段古塔里木河床上，发现若干块土质平台安卧在平坦宽阔的古河床上，大的十几平方公里，小的也有几百平方米，像沙海里的片片孤岛。这些土质平地随河道弯曲而变化，一般位于古塔里木河的静水区，高约50厘米，有稀疏的植物生长。
    以前，中外探险家在沙漠腹地都是只见黄沙未见土。近年，有科学工作者在沙漠周边的西域砾石层上发现过风成亚沙土。
    陷于沙丘重围之中的这些土质平地，经过千万年的风沙侵蚀，为什么还能留存至今，而未被黄沙吞没？
    这对沙漠专家们还是个未解之谜。
