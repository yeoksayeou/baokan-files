Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd.

    The China Medical News reported that according to the Henan Provincial Bureau of Medicine and the Provincial Medicine Company, due to the chaotic management of the western medicine wholesale market across the province, the state has lost 120 million yuan in tax revenue annually.

    According to an investigation, the management of the western medicine market in Henan Province is fragmented, leading to blockages in the main channels of state-owned pharmaceutical commerce. Collective and individual enterprises have been involved in the western medicine wholesale business, which not only results in tax evasion but also alters the profit channels. It is estimated that this year, the annual sales volume of western medicine in Henan Province is approximately 2.359 billion yuan. Of this, state-owned pharmaceutical commerce accounts for 1.204 billion yuan, while sales outside the state-owned main channels reach 1.155 billion yuan. These wholesale dealers, who operate with a "grab for food" mentality, if their gross profit margin is calculated at 18% and expenses at 9%, would result in approximately 104 million yuan in profits not entering the national treasury annually. Additionally, they mostly do not pay the wholesale tax.

    河南西药市场混乱  国家税利流失严重
    新华社北京8月23日电  中国医药报报道说，据河南省医药局、省医药公司反映，由于全省西药批发市场混乱，致使国家税利一年白白流失1.2亿元。
    据调查，河南省西药市场管理政出多门，造成国营医药商业主渠道堵塞，集体、个体企业纷纷插手西药批发业务，这不仅偷漏了国税，而且改变了利润渠道。据匡算，今年河南省西药年销售额约达23.59亿元，其中国营医药商业只有12.04亿元，国营主渠道以外的销售总额却达11.55亿元。这些带有“抢食”色彩西药批发商们，若经营的毛利率按18％、费用按9％计算，年实现利润约有1.04亿元进不到国库。他们中批发税也大都不交。
