The State Council recently issued a notice on further expediting and strengthening the cleanup of fixed asset investment projects, requiring all regions and departments to take effective measures to resolutely complete the task of reducing the investment scale for 1989 as assigned by the State Council, and to ensure the smooth progress of the rectification and rectification work.

The notice said that since this year, the work of cleaning up ongoing fixed asset investment projects and reducing the investment scale has achieved certain results. Various regions and departments have stopped or suspended a number of ongoing projects, basically curbing the trend of large-scale construction of buildings and halls; the number of new projects started has been significantly reduced; the total fixed asset investment of the whole society has decreased compared to the same period last year, and the trend of year-on-year expansion of the investment scale has been curbed; and attention has begun to be paid to the adjustment of the investment structure. However, from the situation of most regions and departments, the reduction of the investment scale is still quite different from the assessment indicators issued by the State Council; a few regions and departments have actually increased their investment in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year.

The notice requires the following:

1. The cleanup of projects by various regions and departments should continue to implement the system of primary responsibility of administrative leaders. The main responsible comrades of the State Council departments (companies) and the people's governments of various regions should overcome the tendency to relax efforts and the idea of "good enough," personally preside over the analysis of the investment completion situation in their regions and departments in the first half of the year, formulate effective measures to ensure the completion of the reduction task and not exceed the planned "cage," and report to the State Council Leading Group for the Cleanup of Fixed Asset Investment Projects by September 20.

2. Further efforts should be made to stop or suspend projects. Projects that cannot fit into the planned "cage" should be stopped or suspended nationwide, including projects with surplus processing industries and projects where energy, transportation, and raw material supply are not guaranteed. The principle of subordinating local interests to overall interests and current interests to long-term interests should be truly implemented. Proper handling of the aftermath of stopped or suspended projects should be done.

3. Strengthen the control of the investment scale of collective-owned units and individual investments. Township enterprises that waste electricity and raw materials should be resolutely shut down, and actions should be decisive. Further tighten the money supply and strictly control the loan scale of relevant specialized banks, especially rural credit cooperatives; at the same time, local governments at all levels should strengthen the management of project approvals and land use. Effective measures should be taken to guide farmers to use their own funds for agriculture and supporting industries.

4. Focus on exemplary cases and implement rewards and punishments. Those with outstanding achievements in cleanup and reduction work should be commended; the main responsible persons who fail to reduce the investment scale and have poor results, and those who arbitrarily approve new projects, should be criticized and seriously dealt with; those who act arbitrarily and openly violate the decisions of the State Council should be severely punished, and the responsibilities of relevant leading comrades and direct perpetrators should be investigated.

5. Strengthen the audit and supervision of fixed asset investments and gradually expand the audit scope. In addition to continuing to conduct follow-up audits of stopped or suspended projects, the audit departments should also issue audit certificates for the funds of resumed construction of stopped or suspended projects and new projects, whether the funds are in place and the sources are legitimate. Those who violate laws and disciplines should be seriously dealt with.

6. To ensure the completion of this year's task of reducing the investment scale, the State Council's inspection team for the cleanup of fixed asset investment projects will soon go to various places again to provide further assistance, inspection, and implementation.

### 国务院通知各地各部门  抓紧清理投资项目工作  坚决完成今年压缩任务

    国务院通知各地各部门
    抓紧清理投资项目工作  坚决完成今年压缩任务
    新华社北京8月28日电  国务院最近发出关于进一步抓紧抓好清理固定资产投资项目工作的通知，要求各地区、各部门进一步采取有效措施，坚决完成国务院下达的1989年压缩投资规模的任务，确保治理整顿工作的顺利进行。
    《通知》说，今年以来，清理固定资产投资在建项目、压缩投资规模的工作，取得了一定成绩，各地区、各部门都停缓建了一批在建项目，基本上煞住了大上楼堂馆所之风；新开工项目大幅度减少；全社会固定资产投资比去年同期有所减少，投资规模逐年膨胀的势头得到了遏制；并开始注意了投资结构的调整。但是，从大多数地区和部门的情况看，压缩投资规模与国务院下达的考核指标相比，仍有相当大的差距；少数地区和部门上半年实际完成的投资不仅没有压缩，反而比去年同期有所增加。
    《通知》就此要求：
    一、各地区、各部门的清理项目工作，要继续实行行政主要领导负责制。国务院各部门（公司）和各地区人民政府的主要负责同志，要克服松劲情绪和差不多的思想，亲自主持分析本地区、本部门上半年完成投资的情况，制定出确保完成压缩任务、不突破计划“笼子”的有效措施，并于9月20日前报国务院清理固定资产投资项目领导小组。
    二、要进一步抓好停缓建项目的工作，对装不进计划“笼子”的项目，全国有富余的加工工业项目和能源、交通、原料供应不落实的项目要坚决停建或缓建，真正做到局部利益服从全局利益，当前利益服从长远利益。对停缓建项目要做好善后处理工作。
    三、要加强对集体所有制单位和个体投资规模的控制。对浪费电力和原材料的乡镇企业，要坚决关一批，行动要坚决。要进一步抽紧银根，严格控制有关专业银行特别是农村信用社的贷款规模；同时，地方各级人民政府还要加强对项目审批和土地使用的管理。要采取有效措施，引导农民将自有资金用于农业和支农工业。
    四、抓好典型，奖惩分明。对清理、压缩工作成绩显著的，要给予表扬；对压缩投资规模不力、效果不好，擅自批准新开工项目的主要负责人，要通报批评，严肃处理；对一意孤行，公然违反国务院决定的要严加惩处，并追究有关领导同志和直接责任者的责任。
    五、要加强对固定资产投资的审计监督，逐步扩大审计范围。除对停缓建项目要继续进行跟踪审计外，对停缓建项目恢复建设和新开工项目资金是否落实，来源是否正当，也需审计部门出具审计证明。对违法乱纪者，要严肃处理。
    六、为了确保今年压缩投资规模任务的完成，国务院清理固定资产投资项目检查组要在近期再次分赴各地进一步帮助、检查、落实。
