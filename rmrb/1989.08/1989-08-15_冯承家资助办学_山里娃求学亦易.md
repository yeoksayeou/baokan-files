Feng Chengjia Supports Education: Mountain Children Find Learning Easier

Our city's Mahe Town, Shuanghe Village, is located in a mountainous area and has coal resources. In 1984, the village-run small coal mine was on the brink of closure due to poor sales.

Communist Party member Feng Chengjia took the initiative to take over the village-run small coal mine. To find a market, he and his five sons worked day and night. They also successively built 8 coal ball factories in the surrounding counties and cities. As a result, Feng Chengjia's family gradually became wealthy.

Feng Chengjia once taught in a mountain school and understood that mountain children need knowledge. He has donated a total of 45,000 yuan to several primary and secondary schools. This year, when he learned that the town committee and town government were going to build a middle school, he again took the initiative to donate 31,000 yuan. So far, he has paid 23,000 yuan to the town.

    冯承家资助办学　山里娃求学亦易
    我市马河镇双河村地处山区，有煤炭资源。1984年，村办的小煤窑因销路不好濒临倒闭。
    共产党员冯承家便主动提出承包村办小煤窑，为了打开销路，他们父子5人日夜在外奔波。他们还先后在周围县、市建起了8个煤球场。因此，冯承家一家逐渐富了起来。
    冯承家曾在山区教过书，明白山里的孩子需要知识，便先后向几所中、小学捐款45000元。今年，老冯得知镇委、镇政府要修一所中学，又主动提出捐款31000元。目前，他已向镇里交款23000元。
