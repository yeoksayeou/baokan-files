In the depths of the Taihang Mountains, in Shanxi Province's Wuxiang County, the former headquarters of the Eighth Route Army, a part-time writer who has been dedicated for 30 years to promoting the glorious traditions of the Party has been praised by the people. He is Li Zhikuang, the director of the Wuxiang County Cultural Bureau.

Li Zhikuang, who was born and raised in the Taihang Mountains and the southeastern part of Shanxi, witnessed the thrilling struggles in the Taihang Mountains during his childhood. He saw the revolutionary spirit of the Eighth Route Army soldiers who were carried off the battlefield, unyielding and brave. He heard many vivid stories about the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Vice Commander Peng Dehuai, and Liu Bochen, Deng Xiaoping. Li Zhikuang felt that if he did not record and promote the deeds of the revolutionary predecessors who fought for the people, he would be ungrateful to the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries and countless revolutionary martyrs.

More than 20 years ago, as a young man who loved literature, Li Zhikuang began to engage in the creation of biographical literature about revolutionary leaders and martyrs. At the former headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and the sites of the anti-Japanese battlefield, he interviewed one old soldier after another, collecting a large amount of vivid material. He wrote about Commander-in-Chief Zhu, General Zuo, Commander Liu, and Political Commissar Deng... When he wrote to the point of excitement, he also had tears in his eyes.

During the turbulent years, writing was difficult, so he focused on collecting materials. He traveled to Beijing, Shanghai, Nanchang, Wuhan, Xi'an, Yan'an, and 12 other cities, collecting nearly a million words of historical materials about Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bochen, Deng Xiaoping, and other revolutionaries. In the days when the "Gang of Four" was rampant, how difficult it was to obtain these precious materials!

After the "Gang of Four" was smashed, Li Zhikuang regained the right to sing the praises of the old generation of revolutionaries. At that time, although he was seriously ill, his creative passion did not diminish. He lay on the hospital pillow and outlined 30-plus small titles and an outline for the book "Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Taihang." After being discharged from the hospital, he systematically organized and summarized the revolutionary materials of the Eighth Route Army's campaign in Taihang that he had collected over the years. His works followed one after another: "Taihang Monument," "Zhu De's Children's Corps," "Firelight in the Valley," "Majestic Taihang Mountains"...

While writing books, Li Zhikuang also organized the masses to organize and enrich the exhibitions of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, Wangjia Yu, and other revolutionary sites, displaying more than 1,200 photos and 728 revolutionary relics. He was also rated as an outstanding Communist Party member in Changzhi City.

### 宣传我党传统讴歌前辈业绩  武乡县文化局长三十年著书不断

    宣传我党传统讴歌前辈业绩
    武乡县文化局长三十年著书不断
    据新华社太原8月13日电（记者池茂花、邹爱国）在太行山深处，当年八路军总部所在地的山西省武乡县，一位30年如一日坚持宣传党的光荣传统的业余作家，受到人们称赞。他就是武乡县文化局长李志宽。
    生在太行山，长在晋东南的李志宽，孩提时代就目睹了太行山惊心动魄的斗争。他看到从火线上抬下来的八路军战士英勇不屈的革命精神，听到许多朱德总司令、彭德怀副司令和刘伯承、邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家的生动故事。李志宽感到，不把革命前辈为人民打天下的事迹记下来，宣传出去，就对不起老一辈无产阶级革命家和无数革命先烈。
    20多年前，作为一个喜爱文学的青年，李志宽一开始便投入革命领袖人物和先烈传记文学的创作之中。在当年的八路军总部，在抗日战场的旧址，他访问了一位又一位老战士，搜集了大批生动的素材。他写朱总司令，写左权将军，写刘伯承师长，写邓小平政委……写到激动处，他也热泪盈眶。
    在浩劫岁月，写作有困难，他就做资料的搜集工作。他到北京、上海、南昌、武汉、西安、延安等12个城市，搜集了近百万字关于朱德、彭德怀、刘伯承、邓小平等革命家的史料。在四害横行的日子，这些珍贵的资料得来多么不易！
    粉碎“四人帮”以后，李志宽重新获得歌颂老一辈革命家的权利。当时，他虽患重病，可创作激情不减。他趴在医院的枕头上，拟出了《朱总司令在太行》一书的30多个小标题和写作大纲。出院后，他把历年搜集的八路军总部转战太行的革命史料进行了系统的整理归纳。他的作品一篇接一篇：《太行丰碑》、《朱德儿童团》、《山谷的火光》、《巍巍太行山》……
    李志宽在著书立说的同时，还组织群众整理充实了八路军总部、王家峪等革命旧址的陈列馆，展出照片1200多幅，革命文物728件。他还被评为长治市优秀共产党员。
