Tanjug, Belgrade, August 28th.

The Mediterranean Sea has become one of the most polluted seas in the world, according to a recent article published by the Yugoslav News Agency. The article highlights that 85% of the wastewater from 120 cities along the Mediterranean coast is discharged into the sea. Experts estimate that annually, approximately 120,000 tons of oil and oil products, 12,000 tons of phenol, 60,000 tons of detergent, 100 tons of mercury, 3,000 tons of lead, 320,000 tons of phosphorus, 800,000 tons of nitrates, and 120,000 tons of mineral oil are dumped into the Mediterranean.

The Mediterranean Sea's water can only exchange with the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in a very slow natural renewal of its water.

    地中海污染严重
    新华社贝尔格莱德电　南斯拉夫通讯社最近发表文章指出，地中海已成为世界上污染最严重的海洋之一。
    地中海沿岸120个城市的85％废水都注入地中海。据专家们估计，每年约有12万吨石油和石油产品、1.2万吨酚、6万吨洗衣粉、100吨水银、3000吨铅、32万吨磷、80万吨硝酸盐和12万吨矿物油注入地中海。
    地中海的海水只能通过狭窄的直布罗陀海峡同大西洋沟通，因此海水的自然更新非常缓慢。
