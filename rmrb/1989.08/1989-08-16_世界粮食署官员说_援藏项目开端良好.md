World Food Programme Official Says Tibet Aid Project Starts Well

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Lhasa on August 15th (reporter Dǒu Guǎngshēng), the Executive Director of the World Food Programme's Representative Office in China, Mr. Page, said today that the initial phase of the first Tibet aid project, coded 3357 by the World Food Programme, has started well, and some construction work can begin.

The implementation plan was officially signed by the World Food Programme and China in July this year. The aid will be provided in the form of grain-for-work, with the World Food Programme supplying 34,000 tons of wheat and 558 tons of butter, while China will provide matching funds of over 40 million yuan.
