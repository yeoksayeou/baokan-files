At 9:35 AM today, the Beijing Astronomical Observatory recorded a strong solar microwave radio burst, which has resulted in the interruption of shortwave radio communications.

The observatory reported that since the beginning of the 22nd solar activity cycle's fourth year, solar activity levels have continued to rise. Following a series of major solar flares produced by a highly active sunspot group in March, another significant active region has appeared on the solar surface. This active region emerged from the eastern edge of the solar disk on August 3rd, crossed the central meridian on the 9th, and reached a maximum area of 2.6‰ of the visible solar hemisphere.

The Beijing Astronomical Observatory observed three 2-level main flares on August 9th, 12th, and 13th. Yesterday, the Shahe station recorded a complete set of data for a 3B-level major flare that occurred within this highly active sunspot group. The area of this flare was nearly 0.7‰ of the visible solar hemisphere, and the total solar radio flux was approximately eight times the normal solar flux. According to reports, shortwave radio communications were interrupted for more than an hour following yesterday's flare. It is expected that this highly active sunspot group will rotate to the far side of the sun by the 17th.

It is noted that when large flares appear on the solar surface, they often emit strong ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and large amounts of high-energy particle flows. These emissions not only interfere with the operation of artificial satellites and spacecraft but also have some impact on weather, hydrology, seismology, and human health.

    太阳微波射电大爆发
    短波无线电一度中断
    据新华社北京8月15日电　（记者李希光）今天上午9时35分开始，北京天文台射电观测记录了一个强烈的太阳微波射电爆发事件，这一事件已导致了短波无线电通讯中断。
    这个天文台报告说，今年进入第22太阳活动周年第4年以来，太阳活动总体水平仍保持上升趋势。继今年3月一个高活动性黑子群产生一系列重大太阳耀斑之后，最近日面又出现了另一个重要活动区。该活动区从8月3日在日面东边缘转出后，9日经日面中心经度，最大面积达到日面可见半球的2.6‰。
    北京天文台在8月9日、12日、13日连续观测到3个2级主耀斑之后，昨天沙河工作站又获得了发生在这一高活动性黑子群内的一个3B级大耀斑的完整资料。这一耀斑的面积接近太阳可见半球的0.7‰，全日面射电流量约为平时太阳流量的8倍。据有关方面反应，在昨天的耀斑之后，短波无线电通讯中断达一个小时以上。预计这一高活动性黑子群将于17日转到太阳背面。
    据介绍，日面上出现大耀斑时，往往同时发射强烈的紫外线、X射线以及大量的高能粒子流，不仅会干扰人造卫星、空间飞行器的运行，还会对气象、水文、地震、人体等产生一定的影响。
