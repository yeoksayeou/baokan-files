Shanghai is located in the middle of China's golden coastline, controlling the strategic entrance to the Yangtze River and backed by the fertile eastern region. It is China's "eastern gateway" to the outside world. Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, as Shanghai's economy and the economies of other regions have rapidly developed, Shanghai Port has become one of the world's 10 largest ports with a capacity of over 100 million tons. Various types of ships can navigate to more than 400 ports in five continents. Shanghai has established trade relations with more than 170 countries and regions, with last year's export volume reaching $4.6 billion.

To better stride forward into the world, Shanghai is further improving its image. Shanghai has invested hundreds of billions of yuan to improve its aging infrastructure, making the old city districts look youthful again. Particularly in the areas of transportation and communications, Shanghai has built the new railway station, two tunnels across the river, the telecommunications building, and is expanding the capacity of 200,000 program-controlled telephones and Hongqiao Airport. At the same time, foreign-related units are conducting training to improve service standards and the "Smile to the World" campaign. The improved investment environment has received praise from foreign investors.

The Minhang Development Zone is a "test field" for Shanghai to attract foreign investment. Before 1983, this 2.13-square-kilometer area was still a rice field with "waves of rice plants." In just six years, 51 joint ventures have been established here. Shanghai Global Toys Limited is the first joint venture in Minhang. Initially, the "foreign boss" had a taste of "sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy"; today, he says with a shrug, "Everything is difficult at the beginning, and there is always a process of exploration. Now when I call Hong Kong, I don't have to hang up the phone, and we don't have to worry about running out of raw materials." This company, which produces "matchbox" toy cars, invested $5 million when it opened and had fully recovered its investment by March of last year. After additional investments, one factory has become two.

Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. of Japan conducted a survey, and the results showed:
- The corporate income tax rate in Shanghai's Minhang Development Zone is 15%, while it is 18.5% in Hong Kong, 25% in Taiwan, and 40% in Singapore;
- The cost of water and electricity in Minhang is 40% lower than in other parts of Asia;
- The labor cost in Minhang is around $100 per month, while it is over $300 per month in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong;
- Commercial housing is 20% cheaper;
- Land use fees and municipal road fees are comparable to other parts of Asia. Many foreign investors find this survey material very convincing.

According to the latest statistics from relevant departments in Shanghai, Shanghai has established 657 joint ventures, attracting $2.35 billion in foreign investment. The success rate of Shanghai's joint ventures is 96%, the highest in the country. Particularly, Shanghai has accurately selected several key projects that have a significant impact on adjusting the industrial structure for joint ventures, such as Santana cars, Schindler elevators, Pilkington glass, and Yizhuo motorcycles. These technologically advanced enterprises have become very important to Shanghai. In the first half of this year, the joint ventures that have started operations have made a profit of 300 million yuan. Shanghai has also invested in and established 22 overseas enterprises in 15 countries and regions, with 27 more in the planning stage. There are more than 50 trade representative offices. Shanghai's overseas enterprises are generally profitable, and some have already recovered their investments.

Shanghai opens its doors to the world, and Shanghai strides forward into the world!

    积极吸收外国投资  奋力开拓海外市场
    上海敞开大门向世界开放
    上海位于我国黄金海岸线的中部，前扼长江入海口的咽喉，背靠富饶的华东地区，是我国对外开放的“东大门”。建国40年来，随着上海经济和各地经济的迅速发展，上海港今天已成为世界著名的10个亿吨大港之一，各种船舶可通往五大洲400多个港口。上海已同世界上170多个国家和地区建立贸易往来关系，去年出口额达46亿美元。
    为了更好地迈开大步走向世界，上海正在进一步改善自己的形象。上海已投资数百亿元来改善陈旧的基础设施，使老城区焕发青春。特别在交通和通信方面，兴建了上海新客站、两条越江隧道、电信大楼，并在扩建20万门程控电话和虹桥机场等。同时，在涉外单位开展提高服务水平的培训和“向世界微笑”活动。投资环境的改善，获得了外商的好评。
    闵行开发区是上海吸引外资的一块“试验田”。1983年以前，这块2.13平方公里的土地还是“喜看稻菽千重浪”的农田，在短短的6年中，这里已建立中外合资企业51家。上海环球玩具有限公司是闵行第一家中外合资企业。当初，“洋老板”颇有“甜酸苦辣”之感；今天，他很洒脱地说：“万事开头难，总有一个探索过程，现在我给香港通电话，拿起听筒后不必再放下，我们进口原料，也不必担心会‘断炊’了。”这家生产“火柴盒”玩具汽车的企业，开业时投资500万美元，早在去年3月已全部收回。经过追加投资，现在一个厂已变为两个厂了。
    日本野村证券株式会社曾搞过一个调查，调查结果表明：
    ——上海闵行开发区交纳企业所得税的税率为15％，而香港为18.5％，台湾为25％，新加坡为40％；——闵行的水电费比亚洲其他地区低40％；——闵行开发区的劳务费每月是100美元左右，而台湾、南朝鲜、香港的劳务费每月平均为300美元以上；——商品房便宜20％；——场地使用费、市政道路费等与亚洲其他地区相仿。许多外商看了，都觉得这个调查材料很有说服力。
    据上海有关部门的最新统计，上海已建立中外合资企业657家，协议吸收外资达23.5亿美元。上海举办合资企业的成功率达96％，居全国之首。特别是上海准确地选择了对调整产业结构有重大影响的十几个骨干项目搞合资企业，如桑塔纳轿车、迅达电梯、皮尔金顿玻璃、易初摩托车等，这些拥有当代技术的企业对上海已占举足轻重的地位。今年上半年，已开业的合资企业共盈利3亿元人民币。上海还在世界15个国家和地区投资建立了海外企业22家，正在筹建的有27家，各种贸易派出机构有50多处。上海的海外企业大都盈利情况良好，有的已收回了投资。
    上海向全世界敞开大门，上海迈开大步走向世界！
