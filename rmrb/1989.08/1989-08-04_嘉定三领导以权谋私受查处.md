Three senior officials in Jiading County, Shanghai, have been found to have abused their power for personal gain and violated laws and regulations. After being reported, they fabricated evidence, resisted investigations, and formed alliances to deceive the organization. They have recently been investigated and punished.

According to the investigation, Deputy County Magistrate Niu Chuyuan used his authority to allocate scarce commodities like steel to his relatives and friends. He also misused public funds amounting to 150,000 yuan to organize a trip to Hong Kong for "inspection" through improper means. He repeatedly violated foreign affairs regulations and accepted gifts from foreigners. He has been criminally detained by the procuratorial authorities. Deputy County Magistrate Zhang Dashun exploited collective interests for personal gain in decorating his home, making furniture, and purchasing items, amounting to over 4,300 yuan in various "benefits." Shanghai Municipal Party Committee alternate member Yan Yongjia went to great lengths to build his own "comfortable nest," exploiting collective interests to the tune of over 6,000 yuan.
