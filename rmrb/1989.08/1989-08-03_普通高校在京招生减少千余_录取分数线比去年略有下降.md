Today in the afternoon, a responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau held a press conference on the college enrollment plan, score segments, and the progress of the current enrollment work.

This person said that this year, the total number of students enrolled by ordinary colleges and universities in Beijing decreased by 1,148, including a reduction of 100 students in municipal colleges. In terms of the categories of reduction, there were 623 fewer students in science and engineering, 408 fewer in liberal arts, and 17 fewer in foreign languages.

It is understood that this year's college entrance examination in Beijing, except for the political science score which was significantly higher than in previous years, the scores for other subjects were lower than in previous years. Therefore, the admission score lines for science and engineering, liberal arts, foreign languages, key universities, general universities, and junior colleges have all decreased compared to last year. It is estimated that the science and engineering score line has decreased by about 40 points compared to last year, the liberal arts score line has decreased by 20 to 25 points, and the foreign language score line has decreased by about 25 points.

The adjusted enrollment plan is expected to be sent to Beijing examinees by August 15. From August 16 to 19, examinees will fill out their application forms; then the formal enrollment will begin; and the enrollment work will end on September 23.

    普通高校在京招生减少千余  录取分数线比去年略有下降
    本报北京8月3日讯　今天下午，北京市高教局负责人就今年高校招生计划、分数线段及目前招生工作进展情况召开新闻发布会。
    这位负责人说，今年全国普通高校在京招生共减少1148人，其中市属高校减少100人。就减少类别看，理工类少623人，文史类少408人，外语类少17人。
    据了解，北京市今年高考除了政治平均考分大大高于往年外，其余各门课程考分均低于往年。因此，理工科、文科、外语类以及重点院校、一般院校、大专类的录取分数线都比去年有所下降。据初步估计，理工科比去年的分数线下降40分左右，文科比去年下降20分至25分，外语类比去年下降25分左右。
