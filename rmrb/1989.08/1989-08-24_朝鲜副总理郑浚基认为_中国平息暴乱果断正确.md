North Korean Vice Premier Choe Jun-gi Believes China's Suppression of the Riots Was Decisive and Correct

    New China News Agency Pyongyang, August 23rd - The member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Choe Jun-gi, stated today that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing was a revolutionary, decisive, and correct action.

    Choe Jun-gi made these remarks this morning during a meeting with the delegation from the Foreign Languages Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of China at the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Choe Jun-gi said that the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in China was possible due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the support of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries led by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.

    He emphasized that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly opposes some Western countries taking advantage of China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots to launch an anti-China wave.

    The delegation from the Foreign Languages Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of China, led by Deputy Director Liang Xingyi, arrived in Pyongyang on August 11th for a visit. The delegation will return to China on the 25th.

    新华社平壤8月23日电  朝鲜劳动党中央政治局候补委员、政务院副总理郑浚基今天说，朝鲜认为中国平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱是革命的、果断的、正确的行动。
    郑浚基是今天上午在朝鲜政务院会见中国文化部外文局代表团时说这番话的。
