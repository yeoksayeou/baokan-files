The world's first successful living-donor liver transplant was reported by the magazine *New Scientist*. Australian doctors recently performed the first-ever transplant of a liver from a living donor.

	Typically, the livers used for transplants come from individuals who have been declared brain-dead due to accidents.

	Doctors at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane removed half of the liver from a 29-year-old Japanese woman and shaped it appropriately for transplantation into her 1-year-old son. The surgery lasted approximately 10 hours.

	The child was suffering from biliary atresia, a condition in which the liver lacks bile ducts. Most children with this condition die within two years.

	Doctors anticipate that the mother's liver will grow to a normal size within 10 weeks, and the child's liver will develop in proportion to his body growth.

	The head of the surgical team, Russell Strong, stated that this type of surgery will become common within two years. It will reduce the number of children who die due to a lack of donated livers.

    世界首例活人肝脏移植成功
    新华社伦敦8月13日电  据《新科学家》杂志报道，澳大利亚医生最近成功地进行了世界上第一例活人肝脏移植手术。
    通常用于移植的肝脏取自因事故而宣布为脑死亡的人。
    在布里斯班的亚历山德拉公主医院的医生，从一名29岁的日本妇女身上取出肝脏的一半，切成合适的形状，移植到她1岁儿子的身上。手术共进行约10小时。
    这个孩子患先天性胆道闭锁，肝脏里没有胆道。有这种病的孩子大多数在两年内死亡。
    医生预料，这位母亲的肝脏将在10个星期内长成与正常的一样大，孩子的肝脏将随着他的身体发育而长大。
    手术小组组长拉塞尔·斯特朗说，这种手术在两年内将会普及，它将减少由于缺乏捐献的肝脏而造成的儿童死亡。
