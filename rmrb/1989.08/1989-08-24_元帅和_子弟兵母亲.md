Marshal and the "Mother of the Soldiers"

New China News Agency reporter Guo Diancheng

On August 12 of this year, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, who was ill, learned of the sad news of the passing of "Mother of the Soldiers" Rong Guanxiu. He was deeply saddened.

He spoke with deep emotion to the staff around him about the pair of hard-soled, soft-top, round-toed cloth shoes he treasured, and his mood remained unsettled for a long time.

This pair of shoes is identical to the shoes made by women in the Jin-Cha-Ji revolutionary base area during the war years to support the front. This was a pair of shoes sent to him by the elderly Rong Guanxiu on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the army.

In late July of that year, members of the county women's federation and the village women's representative assembly went to visit 91-year-old Rong Mama. The old woman took out shoe soles she had stitched more than 20 years ago from the bottom of her chest and asked them to help make a pair of cloth shoes that Nie Commander liked to wear back then and send them to him. The women's federation members understood the old woman's intentions. Making shoes for Marshal Nie was not only an expression of their longing for the old marshal but also a reminder to the younger generation not to forget the tradition of loving the country and supporting the army. They readily agreed. After the shoes were made, Rong Mama had someone write a letter for her, telling Marshal Nie that the good tradition of supporting the army had been passed down in Ping Shan County and asking him to rest assured, and wishing him good health and longevity.

Marshal Nie received the shoes and was deeply moved, recalling the life in the liberated areas during the war years and the people of the old base areas. He told his staff that from the Nanchang Uprising in 1927 to the founding of the country in 1949, he fought for 22 years, of which 11 years were spent in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area. That place was his second hometown. The mountains and the people there were unforgettable.

Indeed, after moving to the city, Marshal Nie Rongzhen did not forget the people of the old base areas. He not only frequently exchanged letters with them but also often had drivers, bodyguards, and cooks from the people of Fuping and Ping Shan.

At that time, Marshal Nie wrote a letter to the elderly Rong Guanxiu. In the letter, he said that although this pair of cloth shoes was very ordinary, it contained the feelings of the people of the old base areas and was a crystallization of the bond between the army and the people. He would keep it as a memento forever! He sincerely wished the elderly Rong Guanxiu good health and longevity and wished the parents and fellow villagers of Ping Shan a prosperous production and a happy life!

In June 1988, the elderly Rong Guanxiu fell ill and was hospitalized in Shijiazhuang. Marshal Nie Rongzhen learned of this and entrusted the comrades who were interviewing for the biography of Nie Rongzhen in the Hebei Anti-Japanese Base Area to visit her in the hospital and sent a bouquet of "forget-me-nots" to her bedside. At that time, Rong Mama was so moved that she shed tears of joy and repeatedly said, "Thank you, Commander Nie!" She also instructed her daughter, who was by her side, to send a bouquet of "forget-me-nots" to Marshal Nie. Rong Mama told the people present that in 1944, Commander Nie personally approved the awarding of the title "Mother of the Soldiers" to her. This was an encouragement to her and the greatest honor of her life!

For more than a year, Marshal Nie Rongzhen often thought about the illness of the elderly Rong Guanxiu, but unfortunately, the bad news came. Marshal Nie had his secretary send a telegram of condolence to the Communist Party of China Hebei Provincial Committee and the Ping Shan County Committee. The telegram said: "I was shocked to hear of the unfortunate passing of the famous 'Mother of the Soldiers' Rong Guanxiu. I am deeply saddened. During the war years, Rong Guanxhin's heroic deeds inspired millions of people and soldiers in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area. I was also deeply moved by her spirit. It was this bond between the army and the people that enabled us to win the revolutionary war. We should continue to carry forward her revolutionary spirit, inherit her will, and strive for the defense and construction of socialist New China!"

On August 22, a wreath sent by Marshal Nie Rongzhen was placed in the funeral hall of "Mother of the Soldiers" Rong Guanxiu.

    元帅和“子弟兵母亲”
    新华社记者　郭殿成
    今年8月12日，正在病中的聂荣臻元帅，得知“子弟兵母亲”戎冠秀逝世的噩耗，十分难过。
    他深情地同身边工作人员说起了珍藏的那双硬底软帮圆口布鞋，心情久久难以平静。
    这双鞋，同战争年代晋察冀革命根据地妇女做的拥军支前鞋一模一样。这是戎冠秀老人在建军60周年之际寄给他的。
    那年的7月下旬，县妇联和村妇代会的同志去看望91岁的戎妈妈。老人从箱底翻出20多年前纳好的鞋底，让她们帮忙做一双当年聂司令喜欢穿的布鞋寄给他。妇联的同志深知老人的心思，给聂帅做布鞋，一是表达对老帅的思念之情，二是让青年人莫忘爱国拥军的传统，便欣然答应。鞋子做好后，戎妈妈又让人替她附上一封信，告诉聂帅，拥军的好传统在平山县传了下来，请他放心，并祝他健康长寿。
    聂帅收到鞋子，心情非常激动，引起了对战争年代解放区生活的回忆和对老区人民的思念。他对工作人员说，从1927年南昌起义到1949年建国，他打了22年仗，其中有11年是在晋察冀边区度过的，那里是他的第二故乡。那里的山川，那里的人民，永生难忘。
    是的，进城之后，聂荣臻元帅没有忘记老区人民，不仅常有书信往来，连司机、警卫员、炊事员也常是阜平、平山人民的子弟。
    当时，聂帅给戎冠秀老人回了信。他在信中说，这双布鞋虽然很普通，但它包含了老区人民的心意，是军民鱼水情的结晶，我将永远保留纪念！他深情地祝愿戎冠秀老人健康长寿，祝愿平山父老乡亲们生产发展，生活幸福！
    1988年6月，戎冠秀老人生病在石家庄住院。聂荣臻元帅知道后，委托正在河北抗日根据地进行聂荣臻传记采访的同志到医院看望她，并将一束“勿忘我”花送到她的病榻前。那时，戎妈妈激动得老泪纵横，连声说“谢谢聂司令员！”并嘱托守护在身边的女儿给聂帅捎去一束“勿忘我”花。戎妈妈向在场的人说，1944年，聂司令员亲自批准，授予她“子弟兵母亲”的称号，这是对她的鼓励，这是她一生最大的光荣！
    一年多来，聂荣臻元帅时时惦念着戎冠秀老人的病情，哪知噩耗竟然传来。聂帅让秘书代他给中共河北省委和平山县委发去唁电。唁电说：“惊悉著名子弟兵母亲戎冠秀同志不幸病逝，深为悲痛。战争年代，戎冠秀同志的英雄业绩鼓舞了晋察冀边区的千千万万的人民和人民子弟兵。我也深为她的精神所感动。正是这种军民鱼水感情，使我们赢得了革命战争的胜利。我们应该继续发扬她的革命精神，继承她的遗志，为保卫和建设社会主义的新中国而努力奋斗！”
    8月22日，“子弟兵母亲”戎冠秀的灵堂里，摆放上聂荣臻元帅送的花圈。
