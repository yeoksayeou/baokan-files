Vice Premier and Governor of the People's Bank of China Li Guixian said today that the financial situation in the first half of this year was better than expected. He emphasized that despite current difficulties, the bank will continue to implement a tight monetary policy.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on August 5 (reporter Ding Jianming), Li Guixian said at a meeting of the heads of the People's Bank of China's branches that the financial situation in the first half of this year was better than expected. He stressed that in the second half of the year, banks should continue to adhere to the policy of tight control over credit, striving to keep the issuance of currency and the scale of credit within the planned limits set by the state.

Li Guixian said at the meeting of the heads of the People's Bank of China's branches held today that due to the serious implementation of the rectification and adjustment policies by various departments, the financial situation has shown a good trend. The recovery of currency was better than last year, the savings deposits of urban and rural residents increased significantly, the scale of credit was controlled, and the loan structure was initially adjusted. In the first half of the year, banks recovered a net amount of 57.94 billion yuan, which is 141.55 billion yuan less than the amount issued in the same period last year. The savings deposits of urban and rural residents increased by 644 billion yuan, which is 224 billion yuan more than the increase in the same period last year. In the first half of the year, the total amount of loans from all banks across the country increased by 212 billion yuan, which is 340 billion yuan less than the increase in the same period last year.

Li Guixian pointed out that it must be clearly recognized that the problems in the financial sector are still serious, and there are many difficulties ahead. The financial situation in the second half of the year will remain severe. The main issues are that the recovery of currency in the first half of the year was not ideal compared to previous years, and a significant portion of the currency that should have been recovered was not. The basis of savings deposits is not stable, credit funds are heavily occupied and have large amounts of idle funds, there is severe misappropriation, and some disorder in financial order still exists. Some localities and departments have arbitrarily approved the establishment of trust and investment companies and other financial institutions, and have arbitrarily opened various financial businesses. Some low-efficiency enterprises that cannot borrow from banks are using various means to raise funds, reducing the sources of bank funds.

Li Guixian emphasized that in response to the current financial situation, the main tasks for financial work in the second half of the year are: to tighten monetary policy, stabilize the financial situation, rectify financial order, deepen financial reforms, and promote the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. In terms of monetary and credit policy, the principle of "controlling the total amount, adjusting the structure, ensuring key areas, reducing general areas, and timely adjustment" will continue to be implemented. The focus is to continue to strictly control the issuance of loans, to strictly manage the adjustment of already issued loans, and to optimize the structure of new loans.

    李贵鲜在人民银行分行长会上说
    上半年金融形势趋好转
    目前困难重重仍将实行银根紧缩方针
    据新华社北京8月5日电　（记者丁坚铭）国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜今天在此间说，今年上半年，我国金融形势比预料的要好；下半年银行信贷仍要坚持从紧控制的方针，力争把今年的货币发行和信贷规模控制在国家确定的计划之内。
    李贵鲜在今天召开的人民银行全国分行长会议上说，上半年由于各部门认真贯彻了治理整顿的方针，金融形势出现了良好的势头，货币回笼好于去年，城乡居民储蓄存款增加较多，信贷规模得到控制，贷款结构初步得到调整。上半年银行净回笼货币57.94亿元，比去年同期少投放141.55亿元；城乡居民储蓄存款增加644亿元，比去年同期多增224亿元；上半年全国银行各项贷款共增加212亿元，比去年同期少增加340亿元。
    李贵鲜指出，必须清醒地看到，目前在金融方面存在的问题仍然严重，面临的困难很多，下半年金融形势依然很严峻。主要表现在上半年货币回笼与往年相比并不理想，有相当一部分应该回笼的货币没有回笼。储蓄存款的基础不稳固，信贷资金占压多，沉淀量大，挤占挪用严重，而且金融秩序某些混乱的现象仍然存在，一些地方、部门自行批准设立信托投资公司及其它金融机构，擅自开办各种金融业务。一些在银行贷不到款的低效企业通过各种手段到处集资，减少银行资金来源。
    李贵鲜强调，针对目前的金融形势，下半年金融工作总的任务是：紧缩银根，稳定金融，整顿金融秩序、深化金融改革，促进国民经济持续、稳定协调发展。在货币信贷上要继续贯彻“控制总量、调整结构、保证重点，压缩一般，适时调节”的方针，重点是继续坚持从紧控制，狠抓已放贷款的资金调节，优化新增贷款结构。
