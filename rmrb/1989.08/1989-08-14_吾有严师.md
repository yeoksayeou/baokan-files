I remember attending a poetry gathering once, where a young, handsome poet insisted on calling me "teacher," all in jest. But he didn't know that I have a deep respect for my teachers.

During the Cultural Revolution, I was just starting out, going from a mountain cave to the Chang'an Publishing House. Everyone called me "old," but not "teacher," which got me into trouble. At 25, I was naive and thought that calling people "old" in the countryside was respectful. In the countryside, we called community leaders and students "Old Zhang" or "Old Wang." In the city, this became a sign of my disrespect. My innocent humility took a long time to understand that I should call them "teacher." During the Cultural Revolution, all etiquette was discarded, so that "re-education" was a kind of progress. In fact, no one was more eager to call someone "teacher" than me. I hadn't had enough schooling! If it weren't for the Cultural Revolution, I would have been studying at Peking University's Chinese department. Calling elders "teacher" was my joy. Ah, my "Hundred Grass Garden," Unnamed Lake! Anyway, those who called me elder were my teachers, at least it reminded me of the past, both sad and unfamiliar. But it's good that I finally had someone to teach. After that, I changed my way of addressing people, and immediately gave the impression of being well-mannered. The editor surnamed "Wen" looked pleased. The interrupted education in my self-study was resumed by calling someone "teacher." Yes, if I didn't teach myself and seek a master, who would help me? Fortunately, what I call "teacher" in my mouth and heart is not just "teacher." From this social demand for "teacher," I saw that I still have hope to be a student. My "calling" is genuine, a natural outpouring of emotion. I seem to have forgotten that the time of calling teachers "stinking ninth category" has not completely passed.

In Peking University Affiliated High School, to be honest, the teachers in our Class 1, Grade 1 were all unique. They taught us mathematics, geometry, chemistry, and language. I was the language representative. These teachers were loved by the students, and there was always laughter in their classes. The mathematics teacher, Mr. Wang, was very funny. He taught us as if we were playing. He was always smiling, and even a bad student like me benefited from him, making me feel that with a little effort, I could become a four-point student. I knew that if I were in another school, I would definitely get a three. His witty remarks were all about mathematics. They were fresh and enjoyable, unmatched by any later teachers. The chemistry teacher was also very down-to-earth, not at all boisterous or arrogant. He could paint, and his paintings were the most attractive works in the school's art exhibition. I remember his paintings: "Dalian Harbor" and "Intrigue and Love." The first art exhibition I saw was at Peking University Affiliated High School. He loved his students and always reminded us to be careful during experiments. Iodine burns with a blue flame, and the handkerchief with alcohol burned out, but the handkerchief remained white. The geometry teacher wore glasses on his nose, was gentle and refined, and walked with his legs forward. "Alpha," Alphas, we all called him "Alpha." His face was very red, not at all like a strict teacher. A strict teacher should be serious, not humorous, and not kind-hearted. The language teacher had a unique demeanor, also wore glasses, black-rimmed ones, and his face was naturally dark. Classmates said it was from smoking. "Against the evening rain sweeping the river," "Sad, sad, sad, sad," with a Shandong accent, really like Li Qingzhao's accent. When he raised his hand, everyone didn't look at anything else, just stared at his right middle finger, yellow and black, who knows how many sorrows were burned away by the smoke.

Their lectures all had an indescribable flavor, deeply imprinted in the students' minds. Why is this? Let my readers find the answer. I thought that if I got into Peking University Affiliated High School, I would fail in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, but these teachers made the bitterness of mathematics, physics, and chemistry fade away. After two years, all the high school courses were finished. I almost had the chance to get an excellent medal, except for the last semester's physics score that pulled me down. Strict teachers are not all frowning and stern. Their jokes will also make us listen attentively. Now I am really surprised that they have so lightly led me through the most tortuous and winding path of my youth.

There are not many teachers who are truly strict, and they are all self-seeking. Ten years later, when the college entrance examination was restored, the university I attended had a Chinese department. The teacher who taught us composition was surnamed "Yan." When he taught, I had just gotten married, at 28 years old. The teacher was very considerate of the older students in our class. Later, he also carved a seal for me. That piece of stone is still preserved by me and has become my only seal. It was "my him" who carved the formal seal for me outside, which I carelessly placed and don't know where it went. In my special experience, teachers represent everything. The teacher's voice is clear and penetrating. He gathers the sounds of heaven and earth, and our ears begin to distinguish all the sounds of life from him. Even today, seeing my class teacher with gray temples, my heart is filled with different feelings. I wish my teachers would live long lives, and in every school reunion, let the birds in the sky fly back and weave a magnificent harmony on the trees of the mother school.

The teacher who edited "She is that Mei" is surnamed "Yan," and he also has a loyal and honest face, seeming not very strict. The time I spent with my teachers is so little, I can count it on my fingers. A person with a stutter can't change himself, but I know the teacher understands my feelings. They live very simply, and their concern for me seems to be "natural and reasonable." Strict teachers are all honest people, naturally helping those they think should be helped. The reason I have teachers is also the reason teachers have me.

    吾有严师
    梅绍静
    记得参加一次诗会，一位少年英俊的诗人对我呼必称“师”，很一番雅谑。其实他不知道，我之亲师，是有研究的。
    文革中，我“初出茅舍”，从山顶窑洞去到长安出版社，呼必称“老”，后边没有“师”，还给我惹出了麻烦。二十五岁的我，满脑子浑朴，以为像在乡里那么叫，不会有错。对公社干部，插队学生一律是以“老张”、“老王”来尊的。到了省城，这就成了我“目中无人”的“表现”。我可怜的谦虚，用了好久才明白，应该呼曰：“老师”。文革时期，摈弃了一切礼仪，那一次“重新发蒙”，不能不说是一种进步。其实，没有人比我更愿意在口中挂上“老师”这个称呼了，学校，我还没上够呢！要是没有文化大革命，我早在北大中文系上学了。称长为师，那不是我的乐趣吗？啊，我的“百草园”，未名湖！反正称长我者为师，起码叫我想起了已逝的一切，又心酸又陌生。但是还好，我终于又有人可教了。以后，我一改称呼，立刻得到“习”过礼仪的印象，那个姓“文”的编辑脸色好看起来。中断的教育在我的自学中以“呼”师又接续起来。是呵，我不自教，不自寻师傅，谁又会来帮我的忙呢？好在我“口而维，心而维”的并不仅仅是“老师”。我从这种社会上对“老师”的要求，看到我自己还有希望作学生，我的“呼”，也就发自内心，是感情的自然涌流了。我好像忘了把老师叫作“臭老九”的时候并未完全过去。
    我在北大附中，不瞒你说，我们高一一班的老师，几乎人人各具特色。他们分别教我们数学、几何、化学、语文。我还是语文科代表。这几位老师深受学生喜爱，在他们上课时，总有笑声。教数学的王老师特逗，他教我们跟玩儿似的。他就那人，一脸笑容，像我这样数学极差的坏学生也叨他的光，好像使点劲也能成四分学生。我知道我要是在别的学校，准拿三分。他的俏皮话均以数学名词为内容。其新鲜，其耐听，为后来之师绝无仅有。化学老师人也很本份，一点也不张牙舞爪，扬风炸毛。他会画油画，学校举办画展时，他的油画就成了最吸引学生的作品。我记得他的画是：《大连海港》、《阴谋与爱情》。我最早看的画展就是在北大附中。他很爱学生，做实验的时候，他总是嘱咐大家，注意安全。碘燃烧出蓝色的火苗，手绢上的酒精着完了，手绢依然是那么白。几何老师鼻上架一副眼镜，文质彬彬，走起路来腿往前送，“α”、阿尔发，我们都管他叫“阿尔发”。脸特爱红，那可真不像严师。严师应该是一些严肃、不幽默、心地不柔和的人。语文老师有独特姿态，也戴眼镜，还是黑边，脸本来就黑，同学都说是抽烟抽的。“对潇潇暮雨洒江天”，“凄凄惨惨戚戚”，山东口音，真像李清照的口音。手一伸出来，大伙不看别的，只盯着那右手的中指看，黄黄的，黑黑的，不知道有几许愁肠被烟燃光了。
    他们讲课都有一种不可名状的滋味，深深地印入学生的脑子里。这是为什么？让我的读者去寻求答案吧。原以为考上北大附中，就会数理化不及格，没想到这几位老师淡化了数理化的涩味。二年级过去，全部高中课已经上完。我几乎有可能获得优良奖章，除了最后一学期的物理拉了分。严师并不都横眉立目，他们的一句玩笑话也会让我们定睛倾听。现在我真惊奇，他们已经很轻松地带着我走完了少年最曲折蜿蜒的路程。
    真正姓严的老师并不多，且都是自寻去的。十年后恢复高考，我上的那个大学中文系，教写作的老师姓“阎”，他上课时，我刚刚结婚，28岁，老师很体谅我们班上的老学生，他后来还为我刻了一颗篆章。那块石头到现在我还保存着，成为我唯一的印章。倒是“我的他”给我在外边刻的正式章子被我不经意地乱放，不知放哪儿去了。在我特殊的经历里，老师，代表着一切。老师的声音清亮又透彻，他把天籁、人籁集中起来，我们的耳朵从他那开始识别一切生命之音。就是今天，看见我的班主任两鬓斑斑，我心就别是一番感慨。我愿我的老师长长地活下去，在每一次校庆时，都让天上的鸟飞回，在母校的大树上织成一片壮丽的和声。
    给我编辑《她就是那个梅》的老师姓严，他也是一脸的忠厚，甚为不严似的。我去亲近老师时间是多么少，可以说，数得过来。口拙的人没法改变他自己，但我知道老师体会我的感情。他们很平淡地活着，对于我的关怀仿佛认为是“天经地义”。严师均为老老实实的人，自自然然地帮助那些他们认为应该帮助的人。我之所以有师，亦师之所以有我。
