Xinhua News Agency, Ningbo, August 6th — In recent days, over 5,000 officials from Ningbo have rushed to the frontlines of summer planting and harvesting. They are working to harvest the ripe early rice and helping farmers solve practical issues related to harvesting, planting, and drying.

Before the early rice harvest began, the Ningbo Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government established a "Double Summer" office. They selected officials from 55 bureau-level units to form work teams, which were sent to 52 districts (towns) across the city. The teams checked the implementation of various agricultural policies and helped local areas solve production difficulties, ensuring the high-quality and timely completion of early rice harvesting, late rice planting, and summer grain storage tasks for the entire city.

Ningbo's deputy mayor in charge of agriculture, Ying Zhongyun, led the first group of 40 officials from the Municipal Office to Qiujie Town's Qiu'er Village, where they harvested rice at the Qiu Lipu family farm. Following this, over 300 officials from various municipal bureaus, commissions, and offices, along with more than 4,700 officials from counties, districts, and towns, also rushed to the fields. Officials from the Beilun District Party Committee and Government, who participated in the rush planting and harvesting, all brought their own food and drinks, refusing to eat a single meal provided by the farmers. Many farmers, seeing the officials working in the fields with sweat and mud on their faces and barefoot, excitedly said, "The good work style of the officials has returned."

    宁波五千机关干部下乡参加夏种夏收
    农民说：“干部的好作风又回来了”
    新华社宁波8月6日电  （记者郭说传）连日来，宁波市有5000多名机关干部奔赴夏收夏种第一线，突击收割已成熟的早稻，帮助农民解决收、种、晒等实际问题。
    宁波市委、市政府在早稻开镰之前，建立了“双夏”办公室，从55个局级单位抽调干部组成工作组，深入全市52个区（镇），检查各项农业政策的落实情况，为基层解决生产中的实际困难，以保质保量完成全市早稻收割、晚稻播种和夏粮入库任务。
    宁波市主管农业的副市长应中甬，率先带领办公厅40名干部到邱隘镇邱二村的邱利甫家庭农场，挥镰收割。紧接着，市级机关各委、办、局的300多名干部和各县、区和乡镇的4700多名机关干部，也纷纷奔赴田头。北仑区委、区政府参加抢种抢收的干部，都自带干粮和饮料，不吃农户一餐招待饭。许多农户望着汗一把、泥一把赤脚下田的机关干部们，激动地说：“干部的好作风又回来了。”
