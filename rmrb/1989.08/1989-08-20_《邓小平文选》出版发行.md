Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 20th - The "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1938-1965)" edited by the Editorial Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been published by the People's Publishing House and will be distributed nationwide in Xinhua Bookstores starting today.

This selected works volume includes 39 important articles and speeches by Deng Xiaoping from the 28 years before the "Cultural Revolution," totaling nearly 250,000 words. Among them, 30 articles have not been publicly published before. All manuscripts in the selected works were reviewed and approved by the author before publication. Deng Xiaoping's works, to a great extent, reflect his contributions in theory and practice to military affairs, politics, economics, and party building during the periods of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the 17 years after the founding of the nation.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Deng Xiaoping served as the Political Commissar of the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army, Secretary of the Taihang Sub-bureau of the Communist Party of China, and later as the Acting Secretary of the North China Bureau, and also oversaw the work of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters. Under extremely difficult conditions, he took on the responsibility of leading the anti-Japanese base areas in North China. This period includes 9 works in the selected works, which provide profound discussions on the principles and methods of the Party's leadership in the anti-Japanese democratic government, economic construction in the anti-Japanese base areas, organizational work and policy strategies in enemy-occupied areas, and other issues. The article "The Party and the Anti-Japanese Democratic Government" published in 1941 emphasizes the criticism of the erroneous tendency of party-government confusion and party replacing government at that time, which is still of great significance for understanding the principle of separating party and government today. The article "A Brief Summary of the Struggle Against the Enemy Over the Past Five Years" published in 1943 proposes that the struggle between the enemy and us is not only a competition of military strength but also a competition of all abilities; it is not only a struggle of strength but more importantly a struggle of wisdom. Based on the characteristics of the enemy being strong and us being weak and the complex situation of intertwined struggles, it is necessary to grasp the essence of the Sino-Japanese contradiction, develop the anti-Japanese national united front, implement the policy of "advancing as the enemy advances," and accumulate strength from all aspects to prepare for a strategic counteroffensive. This series of policies and strategies played an important guiding role in winning the victory in North China.

During the War of Liberation, Deng Xiaoping served as the Political Commissar of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army, the Central Plains Field Army, and the Second Field Army, the Secretary of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau, the First Secretary of the Central Plains Bureau and the East China Bureau, and the Secretary of the General Front Committee. Under the leadership of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, he commanded the People's Liberation Army to engage in decisive battles with the Nationalist Army on several key battlefields. The selected works include 7 articles from this period, discussing the strategic principles and deployments from advancing into the Central Plains, establishing the Dabie Mountain base area, to the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou campaign. Based on the spirit of the instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he creatively formulated the policies and strategies for land reform and party rectification in the newly liberated areas in the Central Plains. These policies and strategies were considered by the Party Central Committee to be universally applicable to all newly liberated areas and played an important role in the formation of policies in the early days of the founding of the nation. The two articles "The Victory Situation of Advancing into the Central Plains and the Current Policies and Strategies" and "Implementing the Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Land Reform and Party Rectification Work" from 1948 prominently reflect Deng Xiaoping's strategic thinking of starting from the overall situation in the revolutionary struggle, his revolutionary spirit of daring to take on responsibilities, daring to struggle, and daring to win, as well as his revolutionary boldness of being able to discover new problems in new complex situations, daring to propose new viewpoints, and being able to open up new situations. The latter article was highly praised by Comrade Mao Zedong.

In the 17 years after the founding of the nation, Deng Xiaoping served as the party, government, and military leader of the Southwest region for the first three years, independently taking full responsibility for the leadership of a large region. The selected works include 6 articles from this period, covering strategies for work in new areas, news work, united front work, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and party building. "Report at the Southwest News Work Conference" was made in 1950 and still has guiding significance for the news work of the entire party today. The same year's "On the Minority Nationality Issues in the Southwest" is a document of historical value for national work, fully reflecting the author's characteristic of starting from reality.

After Deng Xiaoping went to work at the Central Committee, he first served as the Vice Premier of the Government and the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; after the Eighth Congress, he served as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for ten years, participating in the overall leadership of the party and the state. The selected works include 17 articles from this period, discussing the principles of financial work, the view that construction is the main task after the basic completion of socialist transformation, the necessity of correctly propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and some important policies and measures proposed to overcome the three years of economic difficulties. During this period, he particularly emphasized the construction of the ruling party, conducting comprehensive and profound discussions from the party's guiding ideology, mass line, democratic centralism, collective leadership, and other aspects. "Report on Amending the Party Constitution" and "Speech at the Enlarged Central Work Conference" are the main works in this aspect. The article "The Communist Party Must Accept Supervision" written in 1957 has clear viewpoints and thorough reasoning, with great practical and long-term significance. The article points out that our party is the ruling party, and a large number of cadres are in leadership positions. In China, who has the qualifications to make big mistakes? It is the Communist Party of China. The impact of making mistakes is also the greatest. "Does the Communist Party have the qualifications to lead? This is determined by the party itself." Therefore, the party must constantly strengthen its own construction. At the same time, the party must be supervised, and party members must be supervised. "As long as the party and party members do not leave the masses, as long as the party and party members accept supervision, as long as the party and party members learn humbly, as long as the party and party members constantly work and carry out ideological and political work, our party will definitely be able to lead the construction of the state smoothly, just as it led the revolution to victory in the past." The article "Correctly Propagating Mao Zedong Thought" written in 1960 sharply criticizes the tendency to vulgarize Mao Zedong Thought, opposes talking about Mao Zedong Thought without Marxism-Leninism, and opposes placing Mao Zedong outside and above the leadership collective of the Party Central Committee. This speech shows Deng Xiaoping's consistent attitude of adhering to principles on major political issues.

From this selected works volume, it can be seen that Deng Xiaoping, in the long-term revolutionary struggle, was good at combining the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism with the specific realities of the time and place. His thoughts and theories are an important component of Mao Zedong Thought.

The publication of this "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" provides us with precious documents for studying and researching the history of the party. Some basic and creative thoughts in the selected works still have guiding significance and reference value for today. Seriously studying this selected works will help people understand the development history of China's revolutionary and construction undertakings from the late 1930s to the early 1960s, understand the principles and creative spirit of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, aid in socialist construction and reform, and help in adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and combating bourgeois liberalization.

    新华社北京8月20日电　中共中央文献编辑委员会编辑的《邓小平文选》（1938—1965年），已经由人民出版社出版，即日起在全国新华书店陆续发行。
    这本文选，集中了邓小平同志在“文化大革命”以前28年中的重要文章、讲话共39篇，近25万字。其中30篇过去没有公开发表过。文选所有文稿在出版前经作者本人审定。邓小平同志的这些著作，在很大程度上反映了他在抗日战争、解放战争、建国后17年这几个历史时期，从理论上和实践上对军事、政治、经济、党的建设等方面作出的贡献。
    在抗日战争时期，邓小平同志担任八路军一二九师政委、中共太行分局书记，后期还担任北方局代理书记，并主持八路军总部的工作，在极其艰苦的条件下，担负起领导华北敌后抗日根据地的重任。这一时期编入文选的著作9篇，对抗日民主政权中党的领导原则和工作方法，抗日根据地的经济建设，敌占区的组织工作与政策策略等问题，作了精辟的论述。1941年发表的《党与抗日民主政权》一文着重批评了当时的党政不分、以党代政的错误倾向，这对于认识今天的党政分开原则，仍有重要意义。1943年发表的《五年来对敌斗争的概略总结》一文中，提出敌我斗争不仅是军事力量的竞赛，而且是全副本领的斗争，不仅斗力，更主要是斗智；要根据敌强我弱的特点和犬牙交错的复杂斗争情况，掌握中日矛盾的实质，发展抗日民族统一战线，实行“敌进我进”以及从各方面积蓄力量、为战略反攻作准备等一系列的方针政策，对夺取华北抗战胜利起了重要的指导作用。
    解放战争时期，邓小平同志担任晋冀鲁豫野战军、中原野战军、第二野战军政委，晋冀鲁豫中央局书记，中原局、华东局第一书记，总前委书记。他在中共中央军委和毛泽东同志的领导下，多次在具有关键意义的广阔战场上，与刘伯承、陈毅、粟裕等同志指挥人民解放军同国民党军队进行决战。文选中收入这一时期的著作7篇，论述了挺进中原、创建大别山根据地，直至京沪杭作战的战略方针和部署，并根据中共中央指示精神，创造性地制定了中原新解放区土改和整党的政策和策略。这些政策和策略被党中央认为普遍适用于一切新解放区，对建国初期政策的形成也起了重要作用。1948年所作的《跃进中原的胜利形势与今后的政策策略》和《贯彻执行中共中央关于土改与整党工作的指示》两文，突出反映了邓小平同志在革命斗争中从全局出发的战略思想和勇挑重担、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，以及在新的复杂情况下善于发现新问题、勇于提出新观点、能够打开新局面的革命胆略。后一篇文章曾受到毛泽东同志的高度评价。
    建国后17年中，前三年邓小平同志担任西南地区党政军领导职务，独立负责一个大区的全面领导工作。文选收入这段时间的著作6篇，涉及新区工作的策略，新闻工作，统战工作，土改、镇反以及党的建设等方面。《在西南区新闻工作会议上的报告》是1950年作的，至今对全党的新闻工作仍有指导意义。同年作的《关于西南少数民族问题》是一篇对民族工作有历史价值的文献，充分反映作者从实际出发的思想特色。
    邓小平同志到中央工作后，先是担任政府副总理和中共中央秘书长；八大以后，当了十年中共中央总书记，参与党和国家的全面领导工作。文选收入这段时间的著作17篇，其中论述了财政工作的方针、建设是社会主义改造基本完成以后主要任务的观点，正确地宣传毛泽东思想的必要，以及为克服三年经济困难提出的一些重要的政策和办法。在这一个时期，他特别重视执政党的建设，从党的指导思想、群众路线、民主集中制、集体领导等方面进行了全面的深刻的论述。《关于修改党的章程的报告》和《在扩大的中央工作会议上的讲话》是这一方面的主要著作。1957年作的《共产党要接受监督》一文，观点鲜明，说理透彻，具有重大的现实意义和长远意义。文章指出，我们党是执政的党，大量的干部居于领导地位。在中国来说，谁有资格犯大错误？就是中国共产党。犯了错误影响也最大。“共产党有没有资格领导，这决定于我们党自己。”因此，党要不断地加强自身的建设。同时，党要受监督，党员要受监督。“只要党和党员不脱离群众，只要党和党员接受监督，只要党和党员虚心学习，只要党和党员不断地进行工作，进行思想政治工作，我们党就一定能同过去领导革命取得胜利一样，顺利地领导国家建设”。1960年的《正确地宣传毛泽东思想》一文尖锐地批评了把毛泽东思想庸俗化的倾向，反对离开马克思列宁主义讲毛泽东思想，反对把毛泽东摆在党中央的领导集体之外、之上。这篇讲话表明了邓小平同志在重大政治问题上一贯坚持原则的态度。
    从这本文选中可以看出，邓小平同志在长期的革命斗争中，善于把马列主义的普遍原理同当时当地的具体实际相结合，他的思想和理论是毛泽东思想的重要组成部分。
    这本《邓小平文选》的出版，为我们学习和研究党的历史提供了珍贵的文献。文选中一些基本的、富有创造性的思想，对今天仍有指导意义和借鉴作用。认真学习这本文选，必将有助于人们认识中国革命和建设事业在30年代末至60年代前期的发展历史，认识中国共产党领导人的原则立场和创造精神，有助于社会主义建设和改革，有助于坚持四项基本原则和反对资产阶级自由化的斗争。
