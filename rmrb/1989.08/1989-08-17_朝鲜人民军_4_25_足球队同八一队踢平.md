The April 25 Football Team of the Korean People's Army drew with the August 1st Team in their first friendly match during their visit to China today, with a score of 2-2.

The match was held at the August 1st Team's track and field stadium in Huangsi. Both teams played cautiously in the first half, and it was not until the last three minutes that the August 1st Team scored a goal from a set piece.

As soon as the whistle blew for the second half, the April 25 Team launched a full-scale attack, fully exploiting their strengths in solid defense and quick counterattacks. After just a few exchanges, Korean player number 10, Song Hyeon-yak, intercepted the ball in the opponent's half and quickly scored, tying the game. Shortly after, the August 1st Team's defender made a mistake under pressure from the opponent's fast attack, inadvertently kicking the ball into their own net, making the score 1-2.

At the 30-minute mark of the second half, August 1st Team's player He Hai Dong dribbled into the opponent's penalty area and, in a duel, kicked the ball hard. The ball hit the post and bounced into the net.

The April 25 Football Team of Korea won the national championship last year and currently has 8 players serving in the national team. The August 1st Team appears to have good individual skills and physical fitness, with an average age of only 21, making them a promising team.

The Korean delegation leader, Colonel Myung Yeong-hyeon, said that the purpose of this visit is to enhance friendship. He believes that the August 1st Team's players have good technical skills.

    朝鲜人民军4·25足球队同八一队踢平
    本报北京8月17日讯  记者温子建报道：朝鲜人民军4·25足球队今天在访华首场友谊比赛中与八一队以2∶2握手言和。
    比赛在黄寺八一队田径场进行。两队谨慎地在上半场周旋，直到最后3分钟时八一队才利用一个机会球获得一分。
    下半时哨声刚响，4·25队便全线出击，充分发挥了稳守后防、快速反击的特点，双方互相攻守仅仅两三个回合，朝鲜队10号成玄岩便在前场截得皮球，快拨入网，将比分扳平。接着，八一队后卫在对手的快速进攻面前忙中出错，自己把球碰进球门，以一比二落后。
    下半时30分时，八一队郝海东带球冲入对方禁区，在对抗中起脚劲射，球碰到门柱后弹入网窝。
    朝鲜4·25足球队是去年全国锦标赛冠军，目前尚有8名队员在国家队服役。八一队看上去个人技术和身体素质都相当不错，平均年龄只有21岁，是一支有希望的队伍。
    朝鲜领队明礼铉上校说，此行目的是为了增进友谊。他认为八一队队员技术不错。
