On the night of the Asarnha Bucha Festival, the campus of Songkhla Teachers College in southern Thailand was adorned with lights and decorations, creating a festive atmosphere. From the entrance to the inner courtyard, stalls selling Thai handicrafts and local specialties lined the path, captivating the eye. The crowd bustled about, making the scene lively and vibrant. The ethereal sounds of traditional Thai music wafted through the air, leading us to the auditorium.

The auditorium was packed with people, making it difficult to see the stage. After we explained our identities, the security personnel arranged for us to sit in the front row. Then, he went to find the organizers of the arts festival.

Amidst the soothing music, a group of girls dressed in shimmering golden traditional costumes danced gracefully on stage. A teacher from the teachers college sitting next to us explained, "This is a traditional dance from the central region of Thailand performed by students from the Samut Prakan Teachers College. The 'Planting Rice Dance' symbolizes the hope for a bountiful harvest this year. The central region is Thailand's traditional rice-growing area."

The lights dimmed and brightened, and the stage began to showcase a traditional Thai drama with actors wearing masks.

"This is a traditional Thai drama popular in the central region," the teacher explained. "It is unique because it has music but no dialogue, so some people call it a silent drama."

The curtain rose again, revealing a group of girls with long, elaborate fingernails dancing to the beat of drums. "This is the 'Long Fingernail Dance,' a characteristic dance of the northern region, performed by students from the Chiang Mai Teachers College..."

"This is the 'Nora Dance' performed by our college, which is characteristic of the southern region. For a time, it was almost lost. Thanks to the timely measures taken by the government and the arts departments, it has been revived and is now being passed down again."

The organizer of the arts festival arrived. He was busy, but upon hearing that we were visitors who had come specifically for the event, he patiently explained, "This is our third time organizing a national folk arts festival. The first one was held in the northern city of Chiang Mai. Since the traditional folk arts of each region are different, we hold a touring performance every year. The goal is to promote and preserve Thailand's national culture and traditional arts. Thailand is an open country, and Western culture has had a significant impact on us. We hope that people can accept the essence and positive aspects of Western culture, but not all of it. More importantly, as the government has repeatedly emphasized, we must preserve and promote Thailand's traditional national culture and customs. This is not only significant for our nation but also for the world. In a sense, the development of Thailand's tourism industry is closely related to the attraction of Thailand's traditional national culture and arts to tourists from around the world. However, we have also noticed that some Thai youth are engrossed in discotheques and have little interest in traditional dances. Some traditional Thai folk dances are on the verge of being lost. Therefore, we organize such activities to guide and inspire people to love their national culture."

We asked why only teachers colleges participated in the performances. He replied, "We believe that to promote and preserve national culture and arts, the teaching staff is key. First, we must ensure that students in teachers colleges learn and master their own culture and arts. After they graduate and are dispersed across the country, they will naturally help to spread and flourish national culture and arts. Therefore, we will continue to organize such activities."

It was already late at night. The music was still playing, and the atmosphere was rich. The guided national arts shone like stars in the night sky, radiating a mesmerizing light.

    守夏节之夜
    本报记者　刘爱成
    守夏节之夜，泰国南部宋卡师范学院的校园里，张灯结彩，火树银花，一派节日景象。
    从校门到院内，沿途摆满了泰国手工艺品及土特产的货摊，使人目不暇接。光顾的人群，熙来攘往，热闹非凡。随风飘来的梦幻般的泰国古典乐曲声把我们引到大礼堂。
    黑压压的人群，几乎使我们难以看到舞台。当我们说明身份后，维护秩序人员便把我们安排到第一排。接着，他便去帮我们寻找艺术节的组织者。
    在悠扬的乐曲声中，一群身着金光灿灿民族服装的少女，仙女般地飘忽于舞台上。坐我们身边的一位师范学院老师向我们介绍道：“这是大城师范学院师生表演的具有泰国中部地区特色的传统民族舞蹈。《插秧舞》表现的意思是今年要多多的种粮食。中部地区是泰国传统的水稻种植区。”
    灯光由暗转明，舞台上开始表演戴面具的古装戏。
    “这是中部地区流行的泰剧，特点是有乐无声，所以也有人把它称为哑剧。”
    帷幕又起，一群戴着长指甲的姑娘在鼓乐声中出场。“这是长指舞，具有北部特点，由清迈师范学院演出……。”
    “这是本学院演出的具有南部特色的娜拉舞（音译）。但有段时间几乎失传。由于政府及艺术部门及时采取措施挽救，现在又得到传播。”
    艺术节的组织者来了。他很忙，但听说我们是慕名而来的远客，便耐心地向我们介绍起来，“这是我们第三次组织全国性民间传统艺术节活动。第一次是在北部的清迈。由于各地的传统民间艺术特点不同，我们每年进行一次巡回演出活动。目的是为了使泰国的民族文化和传统艺术得以发扬光大。泰国是个开放性国家，西方文化对我们有一定的冲击和影响。我们希望人民能接受西方文化的精华部分及好的一面，但不是全部。更为重要的是，正如政府一再强调的，要保持和发扬泰国传统的民族文化及风俗习惯。这一点不仅具有民族意义，也有世界意义。从某种意义上来讲，泰国旅游业的发达，与泰国传统民族文化艺术及风俗习惯对世界各国游客的吸引是分不开的。但我们也看到，一些泰国青少年，他们只沉溺于迪斯科舞厅，对民族舞蹈不感兴趣。有些泰国传统民间舞蹈濒于失传。所以我们举办这样的活动来引导和唤起人民热爱自己的民族文化。”
    我们问，为什么只有师范学院参加演出。他回答说，“我们认为要使民族文化艺术得到发扬光大，教师队伍是关键。首先应使师范学院学生学会和掌握自己的文化艺术，他们毕业后，分散到全国各地学校，必然会使民族文化艺术生根开花。因此，这样的活动我们将继续组织下去。”
    已是深夜了。曲未终，人意浓。经过引导的民族艺术像夜空的繁星闪烁着迷人的光彩。
