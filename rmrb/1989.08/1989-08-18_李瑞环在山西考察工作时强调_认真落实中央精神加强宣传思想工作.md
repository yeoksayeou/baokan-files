	Li Ruihuan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, recently inspected work in Shanxi, focusing on investigating and studying issues related to the propaganda for the National Day, the rectification of the cultural market, and ideological and political work in enterprises. He pointed out that since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the new central leadership has emphasized the importance of delving into reality and starting from reality. Once a decision is made, it must be implemented seriously and resolutely carried out. I came to Shanxi based on this spirit to understand the implementation of the "Notice of the CPC Central Committee on Strengthening Propaganda and Ideological Work."

	From August 11 to 18, Li Ruihuan listened to the report from the provincial party committee on propaganda and ideological work during his stay in Shanxi. He convened a symposium with representatives from the theoretical, literary, news, and publishing circles, as well as a symposium on ideological and political work in enterprises. Accompanied by the provincial party secretary Li Lifeng and others, Li Ruihuan also visited coal mines and labor sites in Taiyuan and Datong to understand the thoughts, work, and living conditions of the workers.

	Regarding the propaganda for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Li Ruihuan said, "We should confidently propagate the great achievements made in the 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the 10 years of reform and opening up. During my visit to Shanxi, I have seen with my own eyes the profound changes that have taken place in both urban and rural areas. It is particularly worth noting that as an energy base of China, Shanxi's coal exports to other provinces account for 78% of the total coal exports from coal-producing provinces nationwide. The people of Shanxi have worked hard and made significant contributions to the stability and development of the national economy. The people of Shanxi should be proud of this. The strategic position of Shanxi Province in China's modernization drive and the contributions made by the people of Shanxi should be widely publicized. Of course, Shanxi has also received support from the rest of the country in its development. I hope that all localities will, in light of their own actual conditions, use irrefutable facts to propagate the achievements of socialist construction."

	Li Ruihuan said that since the national conference of propaganda department heads, various places have begun to rectify the cultural market. The key now is to strengthen leadership. The proliferation of obscene publications is both a result of the spread of bourgeois liberalization and a factor that has exacerbated it, becoming a root cause of juvenile delinquency. Eliminating this spiritual opium is a popular cause. It is not enough to rely on one or two departments to do this. He fully affirmed Shanxi Province's leadership's attention to the matter, the cooperation of all parties, the firm attitude, and the attention to policy. Li Ruihuan emphasized that while resolutely eliminating reactionary and pornographic books and audio-visual products, we must also enrich the cultural life of the masses, promote literary creation, and provide people with more progressive, healthy, and inspiring spiritual nourishment. If the rectification of the cultural market does not pay attention to policy boundaries and does not use good things to replace the filthy ones, it will not be able to truly solve the problem or consolidate the rectification results.

	In a relaxed atmosphere, Li Ruihuan discussed with party and government leaders of enterprises in Datong City and Yanbei District the issue of strengthening and improving ideological and political work. He said that in studying China's urban economic system reform, the focus should be on enterprises and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Workers are the masters of our enterprises, not hired laborers. This is the fundamental difference between socialist enterprises and capitalist enterprises. Our enterprises not only produce products and improve economic benefits but also cultivate talents with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. In a previous period, under the erroneous influence of Zhao Ziyang's weakening and abolishing ideological and political work, "everything for money" was emphasized, and the political quality of workers was neglected. Now, emphasizing the strengthening of ideological and political work is to correct this bias. We should organize the broad masses of workers to deeply study the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, unify their ideological understanding. We should combine this with the actual situation, especially the development and changes in the local area and the unit, to carry out the basic line education of the party's "one center and two basic points."

	Li Ruihuan pointed out that the party organization in an enterprise is the political core of the enterprise, and leading and conducting ideological and political work is its central task. This does not mean that the factory director can ignore ideological and political work. The factory director responsibility system should continue to be implemented, and the factory director and administrative cadres should combine production and operation to do a good job in ideological and political work. At present, to complete the three tasks of economic work in the second half of the year proposed by Li Peng at the State Council's plenary meeting, enterprises have a heavy responsibility. The party and government leaders of enterprises should consider the overall situation, work closely together, and actively work to contribute to overcoming economic difficulties.

### 李瑞环在山西考察工作时强调  认真落实中央精神加强宣传思想工作

    李瑞环在山西考察工作时强调
    认真落实中央精神加强宣传思想工作
    新华社太原8月18日电　（新华社记者惠金义、山西日报记者王建荣）中共中央政治局常委李瑞环最近在山西考察工作，着重就国庆宣传、整顿文化市场和企业思想政治工作问题进行调查研究。他指出，十三届四中全会以来，新的中央领导核心强调要深入实际，从实际出发，决定了的事，要认真落实，坚决把它办好。我就是根据这个精神，来山西了解《中共中央关于加强宣传、思想工作的通知》的贯彻落实情况的。
    李瑞环8月11日至18日在晋期间，听取了省委关于宣传、思想工作的汇报，召开了理论、文艺、新闻、出版界座谈会和企业思想政治工作座谈会。在省委书记李立功等陪同下，李瑞环还在太原、大同等地深入矿井和劳动现场，了解工人的思想、工作、生活情况。
    在谈到国庆40周年的宣传时，李瑞环说，要理直气壮地宣传建国40年来特别是改革开放10年来的巨大成就。我这次在山西所到之处，亲眼看到了城乡发生的深刻变化。特别需要指出的是，山西作为我国的能源基地，煤炭出省外调量已占到全国产煤省外调总量的78％。山西人民为此，艰苦奋斗，付出了辛勤的劳动，对整个国民经济的稳定和发展作出了重要贡献。山西人民自己应该引以自豪。对山西省在我国现代化建设中的战略地位和山西人民作出的贡献要大张旗鼓地加以宣传。当然，山西在发展过程中，也得到了全国的支持。李瑞环希望，各地都要结合自己的实际，用无可辩驳的事实，来宣传社会主义建设的成就。
    李瑞环说，全国宣传部长会议后，各地整顿文化市场的工作已陆续展开，当前关键是要加强领导。淫秽书刊泛滥既是资产阶级自由化泛滥的结果，又对资产阶级自由化泛滥起了推波助澜的作用，已成为诱发青少年犯罪的一个祸根。扫除这种精神鸦片，是一件大得人心的事情。要办好这件事光靠一两个部门不行。他充分肯定了山西省领导重视，各方配合，态度坚决，注意政策的做法。李瑞环强调，在坚决扫除反动的、黄色的书刊和音像制品的同时，要活跃群众文化生活，繁荣文艺创作，给人们提供更多的进步、健康、催人奋进的精神食粮。整顿文化市场的工作，如果不注意掌握政策界限，如果不注意用好的东西去取代那些污七八糟的东西，那就不可能真正解决问题，也不可能巩固整顿成果。
    在无拘无束的气氛中，李瑞环与大同市、雁北部分企业的党政领导干部共同探讨了加强和改进思想政治工作的问题。他说，研究中国城市经济体制改革要把重点放在企业上，把广大职工的积极性充分调动起来。职工是我们企业的主人，而不是雇佣劳动者，这是社会主义企业区别于资本主义企业的根本点。我们的企业不但要出产品，提高经济效益，而且要出人才，培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的劳动者。前一个时期，在赵紫阳削弱和取消思想政治工作的错误的影响下，“一切向钱看”，忽视提高劳动者的政治素质。现在，强调加强思想政治工作，就是为了纠正这种偏向。要组织广大职工深入学好四中全会精神，统一思想认识。要联系实际，特别是结合本地、本单位的发展变化，进行党的“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线教育。
    李瑞环指出，企业党组织是企业的政治核心，领导和进行思想政治工作是它的中心任务。这样说丝毫不意味着厂长可以不抓思想政治工作了。厂长负责制要继续执行，厂长和行政干部要结合生产经营做好思想政治工作。当前，要完成李鹏同志在国务院全体会议上提出的下半年经济工作的三项任务，企业责任重大。企业的党政领导都要顾全大局，紧密配合，积极工作，为克服经济困难作出贡献。
