The literary and artistic heritage of our country is deeply rooted in a rich historical soil, radiating the wisdom of the Chinese nation, and is highly valued by people around the world. This is especially true in neighboring Japan, where there is a deep appreciation for our traditional culture. Not to mention that over a thousand years ago, they sent students to study in our country, assimilating and absorbing arts such as calligraphy, painting, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, transforming them into their own "Shodo," "Chado," and "Kado," even today this enthusiasm has not waned. Worth mentioning is the business community in Japan. They first studied and applied "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu, then competed to read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and recently sparked a wave of studying "Nian Er Tan." Japanese businessmen believe that management is a science, and countless people are studying it to find the secret to business success. Although there are countless books on this subject, fundamentally, few can compare to "Nian Er Tan." Originally, "Nian Er Tan" is a collection of sayings from the late Ming Dynasty in our country. The book's core spirit emphasizes: enduring hardship and poverty is the key to creating all kinds of success in life. This principle aligns perfectly with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Japanese people. No wonder the business community in Japan treasures this book as a gem, calling it the "guide" to enterprise management. Currently, this book has three editions that are bestsellers in Japan.

The study and learning of Chinese traditional culture is flourishing both in the East and the West. Surprisingly, the ancient art of Peking Opera, which is currently less popular among domestic audiences, has become incredibly popular abroad. In Britain and the United States, friendly individuals have established numerous Peking Opera study groups. Foreign women dressed in opera costumes can sing "Drunken Concubine" in English, and their well-trained movements and precise gestures impress even veteran opera enthusiasts.

In addition to literature and art, there is also a strong interest in the Chinese language abroad. In the Soviet Union, Japan, and some Southeast Asian countries, many universities have established Chinese departments in recent years, and even among primary and secondary school students, there are quite a few who study Chinese.

    国外的中国文化热
    我国的文学艺术植根丰富的历史土壤之中，闪耀着华夏民族的智慧，深受世界人民的珍视，特别是东邻日本，酷爱我国传统文化。且不说早在1000多年前他们曾多次派留学生来我国学习，把书法、绘画、品茶、养花等艺术加以融化吸收，变成了他们的“书道”、“茶道”、“花道”，就是在今天这种热情也没有冷淡。值得一谈的是日本企业界，他们先是学习运用《孙子兵法》，后又争读《三国》，最近又掀起了一场研究《菜根谭》热。日本的企业家们认为，经营管理是一门科学，成千上万的人都在研究，以便寻找企业成功的秘诀。这方面的书籍虽然多如牛毛，从根本道理上说，却很少抵得上一部《菜根谭》。原来《菜根谭》是我国明末出现的一部语录体著作，该书的基本精神强调：耐得贫苦生活，才能创造人生的百般事业。这一宗旨和日本人的创业精神正相吻合。这就难怪日本企业界把此书奉为至宝，称之为企业经营管理的“指南”了。目前，此书在日本竟有三种版本畅销。
    对中国传统文化的研究与学习无论是东方或西方都方兴未艾。令人奇怪的是古老的京剧艺术，目前国内观众对它比较冷淡，而在国外却出奇的热起来。在英国和美国，友好人士相继成立了许多京剧研讨会。外国洋小姐身着戏装能用英语演唱《贵妃醉酒》，那训练有素的一招一式、一板一眼，让许多老戏迷看了都颔手称是。
    除了文学、艺术，对中国的语言，国外也很热。在苏联、日本和东南亚一些国家，近年来不但许多大学开设了中文系，就是在中小学生中，学习汉语的人也相当多。
