During an interview, the author learned of the following incident: In Shandong Province, there are two machine factories. In one, the workers are enthusiastic, the enterprise is thriving, and economic benefits are good. In the other, workers follow the principle of "pay more, work more," and as bonuses increase, production actually declines. The manager of the latter factory visited the more successful enterprise to learn from it and was surprised to find that the workers' bonuses in the successful enterprise were only one-third of those in his own factory. He wondered why, despite higher bonuses, his workers were less enthusiastic than those in the other factory.

It is entirely necessary to issue a certain amount of bonuses based on the enterprise's production and operational situation and the workers' performance. Bonuses do have a role in encouraging workers to produce more. However, the role of bonuses is limited and is not like Han Xin's strategy of the more soldiers, the better. This is because material rewards and spiritual rewards have always been inseparable, like a two-wheeled cart. If you only pay attention to one wheel and neglect the other, the cart still cannot move forward.

As leaders of enterprises, one should think more comprehensively. Issuing bonuses is to motivate workers' enthusiasm, which is different from supplementing workers' living expenses. Therefore, the focus should be on ensuring that bonuses truly reward diligence and punish laziness, encourage the advanced, and spur the laggards. Without this principle, if bonuses are treated as welfare payments without doing ideological work, and if one only focuses on increasing the amount of bonuses without limit, people's appetites will keep growing. As the amount of bonuses increases, people's ideological awareness decreases, which will have the opposite effect.

Paying attention to the appropriate amount of bonuses and combining material rewards with spiritual encouragement, enterprise leaders have a lot of work to do, such as implementing strict assessment systems, strengthening ideological and political work, determining bonus issuance based on the actual situation of the enterprise, avoiding comparison with others, and so on. If the work is done well, even if the bonuses are not high, they will still play their due role.

### 奖金并非多多益善

    奖金并非多多益善
    墨村
    笔者在采访中得知这样一件事情：山东省有两家机械厂，一家职工干劲足，企业兴旺，经济效益好；一家职工“给多少钱干多少活”，奖金越来越高，可企业的生产反而不如以前了。后一家企业的厂长到效益好的企业取经，得知这个企业职工的奖金只有自己企业的1／3，感到很惊讶，自己企业奖金高，为什么职工干劲反而不如人家足呢？
    根据企业生产经营情况，视职工的劳动表现，发一定量的奖金是完全必要的，对鼓励职工努力生产有着一定的作用。但奖金的作用也是有限的，并不是像韩信将兵，多多益善。因为物质奖励同精神奖励从来就是不可分的，好比一架双轮车，如果只重视一边的轮子，另个轮子偏废了，车子仍然没法前进。
    做为企业的领导者，思考问题应当全面些。发奖金是为了调动职工劳动积极性，它不同于对职工的生活贴补。因此，其重点是奖金真正起到奖勤罚懒、鼓励先进、鞭策落后的作用。离开了这个原则，把奖金当作福利费，不做思想工作。一味在奖金的量上做文章，逐步升级，人的胃口就会越吊越高。奖金的量上去了，人的思想觉悟却下来了，那就适得其反。
    注意奖金的度，注意把物质奖励同精神鼓励结合起来，企业领导有许多工作可做，如严格考核制度，加强思想政治工作，从本企业的实际出发确定奖金发放，不攀比，等等。工作做得好，就是奖金不多，也会发挥它应有的作用。
