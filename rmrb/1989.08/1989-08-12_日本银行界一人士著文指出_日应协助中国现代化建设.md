A Japanese banking figure, Tsutomu Okuhira, vice-chairman of the China Committee of Tokyo Bank, wrote in the *Yomiuri Shimbun* that Japan should take a long-term perspective and actively assist China's modernization.

The banking figure said that after the Tiananmen Square incident, as a lecturer for seminars and speeches, he visited some cities in China and met many business operators. They were not misled by temporary phenomena and approached the incident with a long-term perspective, which gave him courage. He believes that many Japanese companies, organizations, and individuals have made real efforts to actively assist China's modernization and should be given a correct evaluation.

The article said that what the Japanese should reflect on is that while they hope for friendship with China, they have forgotten that China and Japan are countries with different systems, forgotten the unfortunate history between the two countries, and have a tendency to judge things only by their own standards.

The article stated that in the long years before the normalization of relations between Japan and China in 1972, many people hoped for the normalization of relations between the two countries, fearlessly persevered, and made unremitting efforts. After the normalization of relations between the two countries, the late Premier Zhou Enlai highly praised the efforts of the pioneers with the Chinese proverb "Drink water, remember the source." It has been seventeen years since the normalization of relations between Japan and China. Now, we should recall again that the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China opened a new chapter in the history of relations between the two countries and became the foundation of relations between the two countries.

The article pointed out that now that the aftershocks of the Tiananmen incident are gradually subsiding, we should think again about the relations between the two countries and strive to understand China. We should not be swayed by temporary emotions but should take a long-term perspective and adopt an active attitude of cooperation with China.

### 日本银行界一人士著文指出  日应协助中国现代化建设

    日本银行界一人士著文指出
    日应协助中国现代化建设
    本报东京电　日本东京银行中国委员会副委员长大久保勋在《读卖新闻》著文说，日本应该立足于长期展望，积极协助中国的现代化建设。
    这位银行界人士说，天安门广场事件发生后，我作为讨论会和讲演会的讲师，去过中国的一些地方城市，遇到许多企业经营者，他们没有被一时的现象迷惑，以长期的观点，对待发生的事情，给我增加了勇气。我认为，许多日本企业、团体和个人为积极协助中国的现代化，进行了切实的努力，应该给予正确评价。
    文章说，日本人应该反省之点是，希望与中国友好，却忘记了中国和日本是体制不同的国家，忘记了两国间那段不幸的历史，存在着只以自己的尺度判断事物的倾向。
    文章写道，一九七二年日中两国建交前的长期岁月里，许多人希望两国关系正常化，不怕迫害，努力坚持不懈。两国关系正常化实现后，已故的周恩来总理当时用“饮水不忘掘井人”这句中国谚语高度评价先辈人的努力。日中两国建交已经度过了十七年的岁月。现在应该再次回想，日中共同声明和日中和平友好条约揭开了两国关系历史的新篇章，成为两国关系的基础。
    文章指出，在天安门事件的余波逐渐平静下来的现在，我们应该再次想到两国关系，努力理解中国。不能受一时的感情左右，要立足长期展望，采取积极与中国合作的姿态。
