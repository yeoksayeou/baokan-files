Currently, some farmers use fertilizers in unscientific ways. For example, they spread ammonium bicarbonate on the ground surface, or mix urea with human excrement... These methods cause the fertilizers to lose their effectiveness and waste the farmers' money.

Given the severe shortage of fertilizers, can our fertilizer production plants and sales departments, starting from the farmers' interests, put more effort into improving services? Can they introduce more fertilizer usage methods and precautions to the farmers? For example, in areas with a high concentration of farmers, using wall posters and bulletin boards for propaganda, or attaching product manuals when selling fertilizers, are all feasible forms. The simplest and most effective method is to print the fertilizer application methods and precautions on the fertilizer packaging bags, so that farmers can learn the correct usage methods when they buy fertilizers, making the fertilizers more effectively utilized. This way, not only is waste reduced, but agricultural technology knowledge is also popularized among the farmers, which can be said to be a win-win solution.

In recent years, some places have often bundled agricultural supplies in an unreasonable manner when selling to farmers, which farmers strongly dislike. If the usage methods are included when selling fertilizers, it is believed that farmers will welcome this.

    何不“搭配”几个字
    欧阳永孝
    目前，一些农民在化肥使用上存在许多不科学的地方。比如，将碳酸氢铵洒在地表，或将尿素搅拌在人粪尿里……这些方法均使化肥失去了应有的肥效，也浪费了农民的钱。
    在化肥供应非常紧缺的情况下，我们一些化肥生产厂家和经营部门能否从农民利益出发，在搞好服务上再多下一点功夫，多向农民介绍一些化肥的使用方法和注意事项呢？像在农民比较集中的地方，利用墙报、板报宣传，销售化肥时附带商品说明书等等，都是可取的形式。一个最简便有效的办法是，将化肥施用方法和注意事项印在化肥包装袋上，使农民在购到化肥的同时就了解了正确的用法，使化肥得到更有效的利用。这样做既减少浪费，也向农民普及了农技知识，应当说是一个两全其美的好办法。
    近几年一些地方向农民出售农用物资时，常常搞不合理的搭配，农民兄弟非常反感。在出售化肥时“搭配”上有关使用方法的文字，相信会受到农民们的欢迎。
