Yesterday, you stood under the sky, the wind whirling the grass, and you forgot yourself. A serene smile slipped from the corners of your mouth, but you were unaware. The unending clouds always seemed ready to rain; they were like your mother's constant reminders following you. Mother always feared you would button your coat wrong, and she also feared you might do things too perfectly. Mother wanted to scold you, but the sky was too clear, and she couldn't grasp the wind's wings… The evening light always swept across Mother's complex expression.

You ran off…

You stood for a long time, your fluttering eyelashes reigniting the fading sunset. You didn't know if the world was in front of you or behind you. You hesitated and took a step forward, walking into the eternal sun.

Awakened

Sunlight squeezed through the window frame, crawling across your cheeks. Unable to resist, you opened your eyes.

In your dreams, there were always hurried penguins pushing you to the edge of the shore, making you tremble with fear. Outside, it was damp and misty. You yearned for the transparent river water and the little fish carrying their clear bodies…

Awakened, people shed their sleeping postures and walk with dignity.

Awakened, in the mirror, you see yourself and the things behind you. You wash your face, and the wind brings dust back to your fair neck…

    青春情怀
    （外一章）
    迟慧
    昨日，你伫立在天空下，风卷着草，你忘记了自己。恬静的嘴角滚落了几滴笑意，你不知道。
    那些连绵不断的云永远像要下雨似的；永远像妈妈紧追在身后的叮咛。妈妈永远怕你扣错钮扣，又怕你真的会把事情做得天衣无缝。妈妈想指责你，可惜天太晴，她抓不住风的羽翼……傍晚的光辉总是掠过妈妈那复杂的表情。
    你跑去了……
    你久久地伫立着、闪动的睫毛又把要灭的晚霞扇旺了。
    你不知道世界在你前面还是在你后面，你犹豫着向前近了一步，走进了永恒的太阳里。
    醒了
    阳光挤进窗棱，在你面颊上爬行，你招架不住便睁开眼睛。
    梦里总有一些奔忙的企鹅把你挤至岸的边缘，使你胆战心惊。外面湿漉漉地，你想念透明的河水，小鱼载着一身的清澈……
    醒了，人们摆脱了熟睡的姿式，很体面地走路。
    醒了，镜子里你看见你和你身后的事物。你洗净了脸，风又把尘土沾在你白晰的颈上……
