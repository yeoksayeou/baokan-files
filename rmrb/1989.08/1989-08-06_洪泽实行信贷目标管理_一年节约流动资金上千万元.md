In a situation where monetary policy is tight and enterprises' demand for funds is increasing, Hongze County in Jiangsu Province has fully promoted credit target management to improve the turnover of funds. From the second half of last year to the first half of this year, the turnover speed of all working capital in the county's industrial and commercial enterprises has accelerated to 95 days, saving 12.45 million yuan in working capital.

In the past, due to weak management of credit work, the problem of "easy to lend, hard to recover" was serious in the Industrial and Commercial Bank. To address this situation, Hongze County took the lead in credit reform, establishing and improving the working capital target management system. The new method changed the situation where credit staff only lent money without considering the benefits. Through hierarchical contracting, the benefits of fund issuance, the acceleration rate of enterprise fund turnover, and other factors were linked to the personal interests of credit staff, both constraining credit staff to use funds effectively and improving their enthusiasm.

At the same time, based on repeated calculations, the county's Industrial and Commercial Bank and enterprises successively signed "Working Capital Target Management Agreements," including 10 management targets such as the working capital acceleration rate, the reduction rate of settlement funds, and the self-supplementation rate of working capital. Legal means were used to constrain both the bank and the enterprises, strengthening fund management and improving the efficiency of fund use.

    洪泽实行信贷目标管理
    一年节约流动资金上千万元
    本报讯　在银根紧缩而企业资金需求量不断增加的情况下，江苏省洪泽县全面推广信贷目标管理，向资金周转速度要效益。从去年下半年到今年上半年，该县工商企业全部流动资金周转速度加快到95天，相对节约流动资金1245万元。
    过去，由于信贷工作管理薄弱，工商银行流动资金“放得出，收不回”的现象十分严重。针对这一情况，洪泽县率先进行了信贷改革，建立健全流动资金目标管理体系。新办法改变了信贷干部只管放钱不问效益的状况，通过逐级承包，把资金发放效益、企业资金周转加速率等与信贷干部切身利益挂起钩来，既制约信贷干部使用好资金，又提高了他们的积极性。
    与此同时，在反复测算的基础上，这个县的工商行与企业陆续签订《流动资金目标管理协议书》，将流动资金加速率、清算资金成品资金降低率、自有流动资金补充率等10项管理目标全部签入协议，并运用法律手段制约银行和企业双方，有力地强化了资金管理，提高了资金使用效益。　（许正中　谢兆波）
