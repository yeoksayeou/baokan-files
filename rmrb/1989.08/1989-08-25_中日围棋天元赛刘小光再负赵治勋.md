The outcome of the first China-Japan Go Championship was repeated tonight: China's Go champion Liu Xiaoguang lost 0:2 to Japan's Go champion Cho Chikun.

The second match of the second China-Japan Go Championship lasted 256 moves. In the morning, Cho Chikun made a slightly excessive move, which was immediately cut off by Liu Xiaoguang, who launched a counterattack. By the time of the morning sealing, Liu Xiaoguang had a slight advantage on the board. In the afternoon, Liu Xiaoguang did not adopt a straightforward approach to secure his advantage but instead created a chaotic situation. At this point, Cho Chikun made a series of brilliant moves, turning the tide. In the endgame, Cho Chikun's moves became increasingly outstanding, widening the gap between the two. Seeing that the situation was beyond his control, Liu Xiaoguang had to concede defeat in the middle of the game, thus ending this year's China-Japan Go Championship.

    第二届中日围棋天元赛第二局比赛共下了256手。赵治勋上午下了一着棋稍嫌过分，被刘小光立马切断，进行反击。行至上午封盘时，刘小光盘面稍优。下午，刘小光没有采取简单明了的下法确保优势，反而使局面出现混乱。这时，赵治勋连发妙手，止住颓势。收官阶段，赵治勋棋越下越出色，拉大了双方差距。刘小光见大势已去，只好中盘认输，从而结束了本届中日围棋天元赛。
