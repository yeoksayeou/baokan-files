Title: A Call for Mass Art Criticism

The past few years, perhaps because it is the domain of the common people, the opinions of ordinary folks on art often fail to make it onto the stage of high culture. To attract the attention of art experts, that is even more difficult. However, at a time when mass art criticism is often neglected, there are still those who treat this as an important task in the development of socialist art, and who have earnestly, practically, and persistently made significant achievements.

I am referring to the mass film criticism activities in Shaanxi. This activity is organized by the Shaanxi Film Company and the Shaanxi Film and Television Criticism Association, with the cooperation of various departments such as the provincial education commission, the Communist Youth League, trade unions, the Women's Federation, newspapers, and in some places, the military. It has a history of seven or eight years. Initially focusing on middle and high school students, it has gradually expanded to include young viewers from factories, rural areas, government agencies, the military, and universities.

The content of Shaanxi's mass film criticism activities is rich and varied. For example, every year, there are social events like the "Hope Award" (Xi'an City), "Bud Award" (Yan'an Region), "Sprout Award" (Baoji City), "Mount Hua Award" (Weinan Region), "Han River Award" (Hanzhong Region), and "Spring Sprout Award" (Tongchuan City) youth film criticism essay contests. Regularly (every season or month), a few films that are both thought-provoking and artistically excellent are recommended to the audience as the focus of mass film criticism; in some places, this also becomes a topic for middle school compositions. Whenever a film of particular significance to young people is released, such as "Flowers Beneath the High Mountains," "Juvenile Delinquents," "The Republic Will Not Forget," and "The Majestic Kunlun," special screenings and large-scale film criticism competitions are organized, with representatives from various systems participating. During holidays, various forms of film criticism summer camps and training classes are held, concentrating time to watch films, discuss films, write film reviews, and study theory. Xi'an and Yan'an have also organized large-scale film and television academic discussions and lectures, raising the level of popularization and cultivating a core team and outstanding film critics.

Now, out of Shaanxi's 10 prefecture-level cities, 7 have been able to consistently carry out this activity, and out of 100 counties, 75 have been able to do so, forming a vibrant amateur team and millions of active mass film critics. Take Xi'an City as an example: in the past eight years, over 4 million young viewers have participated in various activities of the "Hope Award," writing a large number of film review articles, with hundreds published in newspapers. In 1986, 83 counties in the province had county-level leaders participating in this activity, providing various forms of support. At the grassroots level, worker film criticism associations, farmer film criticism associations, and military academy film criticism associations have been established.

To sustain an activity that radiates throughout the province and involves hundreds of thousands of people for seven or eight years, and to see its influence deepening, is truly not easy. Those who work on the specifics of the activity naturally face many difficulties and many troubles, which we may not know but can imagine. Let's not talk about that. The most challenging part is that mass film and television criticism has faced various criticisms in terms of direction. At a time when some in the film and television industry and the arts are obsessed with "bed, pillow, fist," seeking fame and fortune, and various associations are obsessed with traveling and promoting new trends, they have almost spent all their spare time trying to do something practical for the education of young people and the healthy development of the film and television industry through this unpaid but beneficial labor. They are in dire need of understanding.

As a literary critic, I not only admire them but also benefit greatly from them, sparking a lot of thought.

I think that the stage of literary criticism, this forum, should have both professional and amateur voices, and both voices should grow stronger. Of course, socialist literary critics themselves should be the rational spokespeople of the people in their artistic appreciation, but even so, it is necessary to advocate for the people to speak directly about the arts and to create as many objective conditions and atmospheres as possible for such speech. Amateur criticism may not be deep or systematic in terms of artistic specialization, but overall, in those direct, simple, and sincere feelings, there is always an era and a nation's most fundamental and profound call for art, always conveying the most eager and most sincere expectations of the social audience for art. This is not only an artistic and life information, but also a spiritual calcium. It can nourish artists and critics, correct the limitations and one-sidedness brought by long-term professional division of labor, and eliminate the negative effects that long-term spiritual labor may cause: pallor and anemia. Not to mention resisting various kinds of viral infections.

In recent years, the acceptance of aesthetics has been emphasized, studying how creation is completed through the appreciation activity being accepted by the appreciator, which is a progress in literary research. But the research on individual appreciation psychology and acceptance process is relatively more and more sufficient, while once the appreciator is abstracted from social relations by the researcher, the research on individual acceptance psychology is likely to fall into historical idealism and cannot truly and deeply reflect the complex situation of aesthetic appreciation of the social group in a specific era. Mass art criticism activities provide an opportunity for literary criticism to measure various indices and states of social appreciation. The enlightened in the criticism circle should participate more in such activities, making their theories have a more scientific and realistic foundation. From this point of view, mass art criticism is not only a supplement to professional literary criticism but also a balance.

### 为群众文艺评论一呼

    为群众文艺评论一呼
    肖云儒
    这几年，大概因为是“下里巴人”的缘故，普通老百姓对文艺的看法，常常登不了大雅之堂，想要引起文艺界行家里手的关注，那更是难乎其难。不过，在群众性文艺评论倍受冷落的时候，也有人能把这件事当作发展社会主义文艺的一项重要工作，热心地、切实地、持久地做出了成效。
    我指的是陕西的群众性影评活动。这项活动是由陕西省电影公司系统和该省影视评论学会主持，而由全省各地教委、共青团、工会、妇联、报刊，有些地方还有部队，多方协作来搞的，已经有了七八年的历史。以青少年为主，从开始的中小学生逐步扩大到工厂、农村、机关、部队和大学里的青年观众。
    陕西群众性影评活动，内容丰富，形式多样。比如，每年搞社会性的“希望奖”（西安市）“蓓蕾奖”（延安地区）、“幼芽奖”（宝鸡市）、“西岳奖”（渭南地区）、“汉水奖”（汉中地区）、“春芽奖”（铜川市）等青少年影评征文活动。定期（每季或每月）向观众推荐思想和艺术较好的几部指评影片，作为群众影评的重点；有的地方，这也就成为中小学作文的题目。每逢上映对青少年特别有意义的影片，像《高山下的花环》、《少年犯》、《共和国不会忘记》、《巍巍昆仑》，还组织专场，搞千人或百人影评大赛，由各系统选派代表参赛。到了假期，各种形式的影评夏令营、培训辅导班搞起来了，集中一点时间看电影、谈电影、写影评、学理论。西安、延安还组织过大型影视学术讨论会和报告会，在普及的基础上提高，培养起骨干队伍和优秀影评员。
    现在，陕西全省10个地市中已有7个地市，100个县已有75个县能够坚持经常开展这项活动，有了一支具有活力的业余队伍和数以百万计的群众影评积极分子。拿西安市来说，8年来有400余万青少年观众参加“希望奖”的各项影评活动，写了为数很多的各类影评文章，报刊公开发表数百篇。1986年，全省有83个县的县级主管领导参加了这项活动，给予了各种支持。在基层还成立了工人影评学会、农民影评学会、军队院校影评学会。
    一项辐射全省、涉及几百万人的活动，整整坚持了七八年的时间，且影响日见其深入，真是谈何容易。搞具体工作的同志自然会有许许多多的困难、许许多多的苦恼，我们虽不得而知，又可想而知。这且不去说它。最考验人的，是群众性影视评论在方向上遭到种种非议。在影视界、文艺界一些人热衷于“床头、枕头、拳头”，争名逐利的时候，在这样那样的协会热衷于游山玩水、播弄新潮的时候，他们几乎花费了全部业余时间，想以这种无酬而有益的劳动为青少年的教育和影视事业的健康发展做一点切实的事。他们太需要理解了。
    作为一个文艺评论工作者，我不但敬佩他们，而且不少收益，引发了不少思索。
    我想，文艺评论这个讲台，这个论坛，还是要有专业和业余两种声音，而且两种声音都日益壮大才好。固然社会主义的文艺评论家本身就应该是人民群众在艺术欣赏中的理性代言人，即便这样，也需要提倡人民群众直接对文艺发言，尽可能为这种发言创造客观条件和氛围。业余评论也许在艺术的专门性上不够深不够系统，但是从整体看，在那些直观的、朴素的、真挚的感受中，总是包含一个时代、一个民族对文艺最根本、最深沉的呼唤，总是传达出社会欣赏的主体对文艺最热切、最中肯的期望。这不只是一种艺术信息和生活信息，更是一种精神钙质。它可以营养艺术家、评论家，匡正长期专业分工带来的局限和片面，祛除长期精神劳动可能引起的负效应：苍白和贫血。更不要说抵御这样那样的病毒感染了。
    这几年接受美学受到重视，研究创作如何通过欣赏活动被欣赏者接受而最终得到完成，这是文艺研究的一个进展。但研究个体的欣赏心理和接受过程比较多，比较充分，而当这种欣赏个体一旦被论者从社会关系中抽象出来之后，对个体接受心理的研究就很可能陷入历史唯心主义之中，并不能真实而深刻地反映特定时代社会群体审美欣赏的复杂状况。群众性文艺评论活动给文艺评论提供了一个测定社会欣赏各种指数、各种状态的机会。评论界的有识之士应该更多地介入这类活动，使自己的理论有比较科学的、实在的基础。由此看来，群众性文艺评论未尝不是对专业文艺评论的一种补偿，一种制衡。
