In 1988, China experienced significant inflation, with the overall retail price index rising by 18.5%. In response, the central government implemented a series of policies. After several months of intense work, initial results have been seen, and compared to last year, the increase in prices driven by new factors this year is expected to be significantly lower. This has had a positive effect on stabilizing the economy, and people's moods have temporarily calmed. However, the situation remains quite severe, and it will be quite challenging to ensure that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year.

Inflation is primarily manifested by the amount of money in circulation exceeding the normal demand for goods production and exchange in society, leading to a general rise in prices and a decrease in the value of currency. So, where does the excess money in inflation come from? Everyone knows that money is issued by banks. Banks primarily release money through two forms: issuing loans and paying out deposits. In China, although the annual money supply is regulated in the state plan, and banks have quarterly credit plans, the actual amount of money issued daily and monthly is not determined by the People's Bank of China headquarters, which sets a quota and issues it downwards. Instead, when the loan amount exceeds the deposit amount and a loan-deposit gap occurs, the business departments of the People's Bank of China at the county center and above can withdraw money from the issuing department, and the money is issued in this way. The actual issuance amount deviates significantly from the planned indicators. Therefore, from a superficial perspective, inflation is mainly due to the lack of control over loans. Residents withdrawing deposits and rushing to buy goods can also increase the bank's cash issuance. Of the 600 billion yuan issued in 1988, it is estimated that about 100 billion yuan was due to the abnormal decrease in deposits.

Why can't China's banks control loans? Generally, there are several reasons: First, banks bear heavy loan tasks, especially some departments and localities exert pressure on banks, forcing them to issue excessive loans; second, units applying for loans lack a self-control mechanism for fund demand, regardless of loan interest rates and repayment capabilities, they always apply for excessive loans; third, banks are driven by their own interests, using the expansion of loan scale to increase their own economic benefits. The fiscal authorities borrow from banks to cover deficits, or force banks to buy financial bonds, and basic infrastructure and public utilities that should be funded by fiscal funds are instead funded by bank credit, all of which expand the bank's excessive issuance of currency.

Therefore, inflation is primarily due to the fact that banks have not truly become an effective control valve for the money supply, or due to various external and internal reasons, banks do not have sufficient ability to control the situation and resist pressure from departments, localities, and enterprises. Therefore, to control inflation, it is necessary to work together to improve and strengthen the work of banks and effectively control the issuance of money. Of course, from China's actual situation, relying solely on the efforts of banks is far from enough. Fundamentally, it is necessary to control the demand for funds from departments, localities, and enterprises.

How to control the demand for funds from all parties? There is a proposal: raise the loan interest rate. Indeed, in the West, raising the loan interest rate can restrain part of the demand that cannot afford the higher borrowing cost through financial tightening, thereby reducing the inflation rate. However, the situation in China is different. Because the self-control mechanism of enterprises has not been effectively established, after financial tightening and raising loan interest rates, almost all enterprises still strive to apply for more loans from banks. Everyone emphasizes the necessity of loans for their own units, seemingly reasonable, and all different. Some say the microeconomic benefits are good, some say the social benefits are good, some say it is for employment arrangements, beneficial to social stability, and some say if loans are not provided to maintain production, losses will be greater, and earlier loans will not be repaid. Therefore, in China, such a strange phenomenon occurs: from a national perspective, there is currently too much currency; while from the perspective of individual enterprises, most are facing financial difficulties. However, if the monetary policy is relaxed now because some enterprises shout about financial difficulties, it will repeat the mistake of the 1986 tightening policy being abandoned halfway. In the current situation, banks, in order to control inflation and reduce loans, will inevitably encounter some "one-stroke cuts" while implementing the "one-stroke cut." Because although the state has formulated industry sequences and preferential policies, there is still a lack of quantitative limits on loan amounts and clear standards and sequences for selective lending to enterprises. Coupled with the differences between local and departmental interests and national interests, it is easy to have situations where loans are not given to those who should receive them, and loans are given to those who should not. Therefore, to control inflation, it is necessary for all parties to work together to effectively reduce investment and consumption demand.

In terms of investment, to maintain the overall balance, the national investment scale should be adapted to the remaining part of the main production materials available in society after deducting the amount needed to maintain current production. On this basis, the annual investment quota is decomposed layer by layer according to the social demand for construction projects and the requirements for reasonable engineering progress, and implemented to the grassroots level, with strict indicator control. During implementation, any increase without the approval of the superior competent department is strictly prohibited, otherwise, legal action will be taken. At the same time, to enable grassroots units to pay attention to the balance of funds and materials during construction, I believe that a restrictive measure should be established, and construction contracts should be widely promoted: after the construction project is approved and feasibility studies are conducted, the required building materials and mechanical equipment should be listed according to the design documents and reasonable construction progress, and the construction unit should sign material supply contracts and equipment supply contracts with the supply unit, and stipulate the method of phased delivery. Moreover, it is necessary to sign supply contracts with the units supplying energy and raw materials after the project is put into production. The legal binding force of the contract must be strengthened, and any of the above items that are not implemented will not be allowed to start construction, banks and financial institutions will not provide loans, the fiscal department will not allocate funds, and the construction unit will not be allowed to raise funds for construction on its own; and the tax deduction before repayment will be cancelled, and changed to tax deduction after repayment. This may become a feasible way to control the expansion of fixed asset investment scale.

In terms of consumption, it is also necessary to adopt an anti-inflation policy. Admittedly, in terms of the total wage of workers and the average actual wage, compared with the growth of national income and labor productivity, it has been generally normal in recent years. The problem is that the income outside wages is relatively large and growing too fast. According to relevant departments, the income outside wages listed in the bank's separate expenditure items and the income outside wages paid directly to workers without going through the bank, the two combined have reached about more than 50% of the total wage of workers. Of course, part of it is legitimate, such as the wages and subsidies of retired and retired personnel, insurance compensation and labor protection fees, social relief and preferential treatment funds, bank interest, relocation compensation, etc., accounting for nearly half. However, it is not to be ignored that a considerable part of the grassroots unit leaders use various means to seek benefits for the workers of their own units, turning the incoming and outgoing goods funds, labor service charges, collective labor protection welfare funds, scientific research funds, and even administrative and public welfare funds of their own units into personal income of workers in various names, such as rebates, commissions, sales fees, entertainment fees, management fees, business fees, commissions, handling fees, labor fees, hardship fees, goodwill fees, consulting fees, material fees, project contract fees, subsidies, etc. This part of the inflated personal income seems to be the focus of our rectification and management. But these income channels are numerous, the means are different, and they are relatively hidden and complex, so it is indeed not easy to seriously clean up. As a first step, the following should be done: First, in the future, the assessment of enterprises and public institutions should not only adopt the indicators of total wages and average wages, but also add the indicators of total income and average living income of workers; second, the income of workers and individual households should be fully publicized, and the personal taxable income declaration system should be widely implemented, and the personal income adjustment tax collection and management should be strictly implemented. For tax evaders, not only should they make up the tax, but they must also be heavily fined, fined to the point of pain, and criminal penalties should be imposed on tax evaders; third, the income of the leaders of enterprises and public institutions should be accounted for separately. When the growth of workers' income exceeds the growth of labor productivity and workers' income erodes profits, the leaders' income should be correspondingly deducted. In rural areas, in addition to levying personal income adjustment tax, the scope of special product tax should be expanded, the tax rate of special product tax should be appropriately increased, and the tax management of township and town enterprises should be strengthened, and illegal tax exemptions and reductions should be cancelled.

Previously, it was mentioned that the withdrawal of residents' savings deposits also has a significant impact on currency issuance. Currently, urban and rural savings deposits in China have exceeded 440 billion yuan. If savings can be stabilized and residents are encouraged to save more, this will undoubtedly be important for controlling the demand with payment capacity, delaying the realization of purchasing power, and easing the contradiction between total supply and total demand. Therefore, to stabilize and encourage savings, on the one hand, it is necessary to advocate patriotic savings, promote thrift, and make more contributions to the construction of the Four Modernizations. On the other hand, there should be a reasonable interest rate. Currently, the interest rate for residents' savings deposits is still relatively low and should actively create conditions to strive to make the interest rate level (including various bonuses for various prize-saving methods) slightly higher than the price increase rate. However, it should be pointed out that increasing savings can ease the current contradiction between consumption demand with payment capacity and the supply of goods, mitigate the impact of inflation, but it cannot fundamentally solve the problem of inflation. This point should be clearly recognized.

In summary, to fundamentally control inflation, the key is to control the overall valve of bank monetary supply. To this end, banks should work with relevant departments to strictly control loan issuance and, according to the requirements of industrial policy, use loans for urgently needed short-term industries to increase effective supply. At the same time, efforts should be made to attract deposits and reduce the excess money circulating in society, so that the demand with payment capacity in society gradually matches the demand for money in social commodity production and circulation. The People's Bank of China, with the support and cooperation of all parties, should become the guardian of the stability of the value of the renminbi, to promote the stable development of the economy.

    管好银行货币供应的总闸门
    罗精奋
    1988年我国出现明显的通货膨胀，社会零售物价总指数上升18.5％。中央为此采取了一系列政策措施。经过几个月的紧张工作，初步见到成效，与去年相比，今年新涨价因素推动物价上升的幅度将有大幅度下降。这对稳定经济起了积极作用，人们的心情也暂趋平静。不过形势依然相当严峻，要使今年全国物价上升幅度明显低于去年，难度相当大。
    通货膨胀首先表现为流通中的货币供应量超过社会商品实际生产和交换的正常需要，从而引起物价普遍上升，币值下降。那么，通货膨胀中的多余货币是从哪里冒出来的呢？大家知道，货币是从银行发放出来的。银行的货币主要是通过发放贷款和支付存款的提取两种形式放出来的。我国的情况是，在国家计划中虽然规定了年度货币发行量，银行也有季度信贷计划，但是每天每月发行多少货币不是由中国人民银行总行规定一个额度，层层下达，而是当贷款额超过存款额而发生存贷差额时，县中心支行以上的各级中国人民银行的业务库可以向发行库提钱，货币就这样的发出去了。实际的发行量与计划规定的指标，相差甚大。因此从直观看，通货膨胀主要是由于贷款缺乏节制产生的。居民挤兑存款，抢购商品，也会使银行的现金发放增加。1988年发行的600多亿元中，估计约有100亿元左右是由于存款不正常的减少而引起的。
    我国银行贷款为什么节制不了？大体有如下一些原因：一、银行承担的贷款任务过重，特别是有些部门和地方给银行施加压力，强制银行过量的发放贷款；二、申请贷款的单位缺乏对资金需求的自我节制机制，不管贷款利息和偿还能力，总是过多地提出贷款申请；三、银行自身利益驱动，用扩大贷款规模的办法，增加自身的经济收益。财政为了弥补赤字向银行透支、借款或强制银行买下财政债券，以及本应由财政资金兴建的基础设施、公用事业转由银行信贷资金承担，也扩大银行超经济发行货币。
    因此，通货膨胀首先是银行没有真正成为有效控制货币供应的总闸门，或者说由于外部和内部的种种原因，银行没有足够的能力把好关，没有能够抵制来自部门、地方、企业的压力。所以治理通货膨胀首先要通过上下共同努力，改进和强化银行工作，切实把好货币发放这一关。当然，从我国实际情况来看，光靠银行一家的努力是远远不够的，从根本上说，必须控制部门、地方、企业对资金的需求。
    怎样控制各方面对资金的需求呢？有一种主张：提高贷款利率。的确，在西方提高贷款利率，通过使部分不能支付较高借贷成本的需求受到制约，可以实现金融紧缩，降低通货膨胀率。我国的情况则不同。由于企业自我约束机制尚未有效地建立起来，紧缩金融、提高贷款利率以后，几乎所有企业仍然使劲地向银行要求多给贷款。谁都强调对本单位贷款的必要性，似乎蛮有道理，而且各不相同。有的说是微观效益好，有的说是社会效益好，有的说是为了安排就业，有利于社会安定，有的说如果不予贷款维持生产，亏损更大，早先的贷款也还不了。因此，在我国出现这样的奇怪现象：从全国范围看，当前通货过多；而从一个个企业看，大多是资金紧张。但是，如果现在因为有一部分企业叫喊资金困难而放松银根，就将重蹈1986年紧缩政策半途夭折的覆辙。在当前这种情况下，银行为了控制通货，减少贷款，在“砍一刀”的同时，发生某些“一刀砍”，将是难以完全避免的。因为虽然国家制订了产业序列和倾斜政策，但还缺乏贷款额度的数量界限，也没有对企业择优贷款的明确标准和次序，加以地方和部门的利益与全国利益存在着差异，这就容易发生一些该贷的不贷，不该贷的又贷的情况。因此，为了治理通货膨胀还需要各方面的共同努力，切实减少投资和消费的需求。
    在投资方面，为了保持总量的大体平衡，全国投资总规模应与社会主要生产资料可供量扣去维持当前生产的需要量以后的剩余部分相适应。在此前提下，再根据建设项目的社会需要程度和组织合理工程进度的要求，将当年投资额度层层分解，下达到基层，实行严格的指标控制。执行中未经上级主管部门批准一律不得追加，否则绳之以法纪。同时，为了使基层单位在建设过程中也能重视资金和物资的平衡，我认为应当建立一种制约办法，广泛推行建设合同：建设项目经过立项并作可行性研究以后，所需建筑材料和机械设备应当根据设计文件规定和合理施工进度，由兴建单位提出清单，与供货单位签订材料供应合同和设备供应合同，并规定分期交货办法。而且，还必须与投产后能源和原材料的供应单位签订供货合同。要强化合同的法律约束力，上述任何一项不落实的，一律不准开工建设，银行和各金融机构不贷款，财政不拨款，建设单位也不得自行集资建设；并取消税前还贷，改为税后还贷。这有可能成为控制固定资产投资规模膨胀的一种可行的办法。
    在消费方面，也需要采取控制膨胀政策。诚然，就职工工资总额和平均实际工资来说，与国民收入、劳动生产率的增长相比，近年来大体尚属正常。问题是工资以外那块收入数量较大，增长太快。据有关部门估计，通过银行单列开支科目的工资以外部分收入和不通过银行而直接支付给职工的工资外收入，两项合计已大体相当于职工工资总额的50％以上。当然，其中有一部分是正当的，如离退休人员的工资和补贴，保险赔偿和劳动保护费、社会救济和优抚金、国家银行的利息、拆迁补助等约占近一半。但不容忽视的是，相当部分基层单位的领导人千方百计为本单位职工谋福利，将本单位的来往货款、劳务收费、集体劳保福利费用、科研费用甚至行政事业费，以各种各样名目，诸如回扣、佣金、推销费、交际费、管理费、业务费、提成费、手续费、劳务费、辛苦费、好处费、咨询费、资料费、课题承包费、补助费等等，转化为职工个人收入。这一部分膨胀起来的个人收入，看来应当成为我们整顿和管理的重点。但这些收入渠道众多，手段各不相同，而且比较隐蔽复杂，要认真清理确实不那么容易。作为第一步，应当先做好以下几点：一是今后考核企事业单位不只采用工资总额和平均工资指标，而要增加职工收入总额和平均生活费收入指标；二是职工和个体户的收入全部公开化，广泛实行个人应税收入申报制度，严格个人收入调节税的征管工作，对偷漏税者不仅要补交，还必须予以重罚，罚到痛处，对抗税者予以刑事处置；三是企事业单位领导人的收入，单独立帐，当本单位职工平均收入的增长超过劳动生产率的增长、职工收入侵蚀利润时，要相应扣发领导人的收入。在农村除开征个人收入调节税外，还要扩大特产税的征收范围，适当提高特产税的税率，并强化乡镇企业的税收管理，取消不合法的减免税优惠。
    前面谈到，居民储蓄存款的提取对货币发行也有很大影响。目前我国城乡储蓄存款已经超过4400亿元。如果能稳定储蓄，鼓励居民多存款，这对于控制有支付能力的需求，推迟购买力的实现，缓和总供给与总需求的矛盾无疑极为重要。因此，为了稳定和鼓励储蓄，一方面要提倡爱国储蓄，宣传勤俭持家，为支援四化建设多作贡献。另一方面要有一个合理的利率。目前居民储蓄存款利率依然偏低，应当积极创造条件，争取使利率水平（包括各种有奖储蓄的各种奖金在内）略高于物价上涨率。不过应当指出，增加储蓄可以缓和当前有支付能力的消费需求同商品可供量的矛盾，缓减通货膨胀的影响，但它并不能从根本上解决通货膨胀的问题。对这一点仍要有清醒的认识。
    总之，要根治通货膨胀，重点是管好银行货币供应的总闸门。为此，银行要会同有关部门牢牢地控制贷款发放，并根据产业政策的要求，将贷款用于迫切需要的短线，以增加有效供给，与此同时，还要努力吸收存款，减少社会上流通的多余货币，使社会有支付能力的需求逐步与社会商品生产流通对货币的需要量相适应。中国人民银行在各方配合支持下，要成为保持人民币币值稳定的卫士，以促进经济的稳定发展。
