Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 30th.

Sihanouk Prince today at the Paris International Conference on the comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian issue issued a five-point statement.

In his speech, Sihanouk Prince pointed out: The Phnom Penh Hun Sen regime is not based on the will of the people and universal suffrage, but is merely imposed on the Cambodian people by force by Vietnam. We propose to the Hun Sen regime to form a quadripartite coalition government, and even agree to abolish "Democratic Kampuchea" — a member of the United Nations, on the condition that the other party also abolishes the "Kingdom of Cambodia," to form a quadripartite coalition government, and to organize elections under international supervision.

Next, the three resistance organizations in Cambodia oppose the "partial solution," because this would allow Vietnam to evade its serious consequences of invading Cambodia. After Vietnam withdraws its troops by the end of September, it must still be responsible for the consequences of the war in Cambodia.

Third, the resistance organizations agree to send international peacekeeping forces and international supervisory bodies to Cambodia, otherwise Cambodia cannot achieve true independence, stability, and the reconstruction of the nation and the freedom of the people.

Fourth, some countries, including some participating in this conference, propose to leave the Cambodian seat vacant at the next General Assembly to facilitate the resolution of the Cambodian issue. We propose that the Cambodian delegation's seat in the United Nations General Assembly be composed of four parties. The so-called "vacancy" proposal will only make the situation in Cambodia more serious.

Finally, Sihanouk Prince pointed out that all participating countries agree that Cambodia should be a neutral and non-aligned country, but it should be noted that as a prerequisite, Cambodia's neutrality is meaningless without complete independence and the restoration of its territorial integrity and maritime boundaries as of March 18, 1970 (the date of Lon Nol's coup).

    西哈努克拒绝部分解决方案
    发表全面解决柬问题五点声明
    本报巴黎7月30日电　记者吕网大、张启华报道：西哈努克亲王今天在巴黎国际会议上就全面解决柬埔寨问题发表五点声明。
    西哈努克亲王在他的讲话中指出：金边洪森政权不是根据人民的意愿及普选产生的，它只是越南用武力强加于柬埔寨人民头上的。我们向洪森政权建议组成四方联合政府，甚至同意取消“民主柬埔寨”——联合国的成员国，条件是对方也取消“柬埔寨国”，组成四方联合政府，并在国际监督下组织选举。
    其次，柬埔寨三方抵抗组织反对“部分解决方案”，因为这样越南将逃避它侵柬的严重后果的责任。越南在9月底撤军后，必须仍然为柬埔寨战争造成的后果承担责任。
    第三，抵抗组织赞同向柬埔寨派遣国际维持和平部队和国际监督机构，否则柬埔寨不可能有真正的独立、稳定及重建国家和人民的自由。
    第四，某些国家，包括一些参加这次会议的国家，提出在下届联大将柬埔寨席位空缺，以有利于解决柬埔寨问题。我们建议联合国大会的柬埔寨代表团席位由四方组成，所谓“空缺”的提法，只会使柬埔寨局势更加严重。
    西哈努克亲王最后指出，所有与会国都赞同柬埔寨成为一个中立和不结盟的国家，但需提请大家特别注意的是：作为先决条件，柬埔寨在没有完全的独立及重新恢复1970年3月18日（朗诺发动政变）以前的领土和海域的完整，柬埔寨的中立是毫无意义的。
