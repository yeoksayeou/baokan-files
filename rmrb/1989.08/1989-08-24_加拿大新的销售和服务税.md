Starting from January 1, 1991, the Canadian federal government will implement a new sales and service tax nationwide. This tax reform plan, which has been in the works for three and a half years, was recently officially proposed by the Ministry of Finance and has immediately sparked strong reactions.

Canada currently implements a manufacturing sales tax that was enacted in 1924. This still-enforced tax system has a rate of 13.5% and a narrow tax base, making it unfair. It favors imported products over domestic ones, weakening the competitiveness of domestic products.

The new tax system will cover almost all goods and services except basic foodstuffs, medicines, and medical equipment, with a tax rate of 9%. From haircuts to buying a house, all will be subject to a 9% federal tax. Some foods may be tax-free when bought from a grocery store, but if processed and sold by a restaurant, they will incur a 9% tax. Clearly, the new tax system's scope is much broader than the old one.

Reactions to this new tax system vary. Large companies welcome it due to reduced tax burdens, while small companies oppose it due to increased tax burdens and management difficulties. Some experts believe that, in the long run, this will be beneficial to Canada's economic development and enhance its competitiveness. From the reactions across the provinces, no province has praised the new tax system; all have expressed varying degrees of concern. The general public is also highly attentive to the new tax system. Under the new tax system, households with incomes below 35,000 Canadian dollars will benefit, while households with incomes above this amount will face increased tax burdens, with higher incomes correlating to higher tax rates.

One benefit the federal government will gain from the new tax system is increased tax revenue. It is estimated that in 1991, the federal government will collect 24 billion Canadian dollars in sales and service taxes, which is approximately 5.5 billion Canadian dollars more than under the old tax system. Even after allocating 3.5 billion Canadian dollars to subsidize low-income households through tax refunds, the government will still have nearly 20 billion Canadian dollars to reduce the fiscal deficit. Finance Minister Wilson believes that after the implementation of the new tax system, 60,000 jobs can be created by 1992, and labor productivity and product competitiveness can be improved. However, it may also lead to an increase in the inflation rate.

In Canada's tax system, sales and service taxes are the third-largest tax after personal and corporate income taxes. Its reform is clearly a major issue affecting everyone and carries significant political risks. Public opinion polls indicate that since the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Mulroney, was re-elected in November last year, its popularity has been declining. Under these circumstances, its insistence on pushing forward with tax reform demonstrates a certain degree of courage.

    加拿大新的销售和服务税
    本报记者　郭文福
    从1991年1月1日开始，加拿大联邦政府将在全国实行新的销售和服务税。这项酝酿了三年半之久税改方案，前不久由财政部正式提出，立即引起了强烈的反应。
    加拿大目前实行的制造业产品销售税是1924年颁布的。这项还在实施的税制税率为13.5％，而且征税面窄，不公平。它对进口产品有利，对本国产品不利，削弱了本国产品的竞争力。
    新税制则几乎包括除基本食杂品、药品和医疗器械外的所有的商品和服务业，税率规定为9％。从理发到买房都要纳9％的联邦税，有些食品在食品店买可免税，但一经饭店加工再卖，就要加9％的税。很显然，新税制的征税面大大超过了旧税制。
    对这项新税制，各方反应不同。大公司因税额减少而持欢迎态度，小公司则因增加纳税的负担和管理上的困难，持反对态度。一些专家认为，从长远看，这将有利于加拿大经济的发展，增强其竞争力。从各地的反应看，还没有一个省份赞扬新的税制，都是表示了不同程度的担忧。普通公众对新税制也极为关注。根据新税制，收入在3.5万加元以下的家庭将是新税制的受益者，而收入高于这个数额的家庭，纳税负担会加重，收入越高纳税比例越高。
    联邦政府将从新税制中得到的一个好处是，可以增加税收。据计算，1991年，联邦政府可征得240亿加元的销售和服务税，这比在旧税制下多征约55亿加元。即使需要拿出达35个亿以退税的形式补助低收入的家庭，政府还可以剩下近20个亿，以削减财政亦字。财政部长威尔逊认为，新税制实施后，到1992年可以创造6万个就业机会，还可提高劳动生产率和产品的竞争能力。但同时也可能使通货膨胀率上升。
    在加拿大政府的税收中，销售和服务税是仅次于个人和公司所得税之后的第三大税收。它的改革显然是一个涉及每个人的大事。具有很大的政治风险。民意测验表明，以马尔罗尼为首的进步保守党政府自去年11月大选连任后，威信在下降。在这种情况下，它仍坚持推进税改，显示了一定的勇气。
