The Supervision Department recently held a meeting of directors from the supervision bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jilin, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Guangdong, and Guizhou to deploy three key tasks for the second half of the year: first, to do a good job in the examination and appointment of cadres and strengthen the construction of the supervision team; second, to actively participate in the formulation of anti-corruption regulations and strengthen supervision and inspection; third, to concentrate efforts on investigating and dealing with major cases of embezzlement, bribery, and speculation.

Participants at the meeting reviewed the supervision work of the year so far. From January to June, supervision organs across the country handled 64,584 cases of embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and abuse of power, and initiated investigations into 18,316 cases. Of these, 15,165 cases were closed, and 10,172 individuals received administrative penalties, including 482 at the county or division level. Direct economic losses amounting to 103 million yuan were recovered.

The meeting noted that the current situation in the fight against corruption and the promotion of clean governance is good, and that the work in the second half of the year must be intensified, particularly with a focus on breaking a batch of major cases. The meeting required that leading cadres of supervision organs at all levels personally participate in and lead the investigation work. Major cases should be publicly reported.
