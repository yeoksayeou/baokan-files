Fishing rods are something everyone has seen, but have you ever seen one with a small flower attached to the fishing line that spins with the water? This poetic and picturesque "spinning flower fishing rod," have you seen it?

This is what a girl who returned from Hongchi Reservoir told me. Perhaps it is because the red carp in the mountain streams and lakes there are so fond of beauty that those who fish with this spinning flower fishing rod often have a richer harvest than other anglers!

Imagine the scene:

At an altitude of two to three thousand meters in the deep mountains. The lake water is a deep blue. Large, fluffy white clouds drift by. There is a shining fishing rod (or several) standing upright. The fishing line touches the water, and a round, plump, watery red flower is attached to the surface.

If the fish don't come, the flower remains still.

A fish bites! The fish moves. The flower spins. The eyes follow.

The heart beats with tension, yet feels so comfortable.

It bites! Pull! With a "splash," a red carp flops onto the grass, a red wildflower splashes into the green water, and a few red faces light up with a heartfelt smile.

The fish leaves the water, leaving its freedom; the flower leaves the line, freely drifting away...

After a cheer, the fishing rod is cast out again. On the water's surface, there is another small red flower, slowly spinning and drifting with the line...

Oh, the beautiful red carp of Hongchi Reservoir, will you still go for the bait, the small flower?

Innovative spinning flower fishing rod, how did those girls who first ventured into the forest come up with this idea?

    转花鱼竿

    钓鱼竿谁都见过，然而在鱼线上缀一朵随水滴溜溜转的小花——这富有诗情画意的“转花鱼竿”，你见过么？
    这是一位从红池坝回来的姑娘告诉我的。许是那儿山溪湖塘里随处可见的红鲤鱼爱美的缘故吧，用这种转花鱼竿垂钓的人，往往收获比旁的垂钓者丰富得多！
    想想，那是怎样的一种情致：
    海拔两三千米的深山老林边。湛蓝湛蓝的湖水。大朵大朵的白云。闪闪的一根（或是几根）钓竿。鱼线接水处，一枚圆嘟嘟水汪汪的小红花贴于水面。
    鱼不来，花静。
    撞食了！鱼转。花转。眼珠转。
    心儿紧张得跳，又惬意得可以。
    咬钩了！拉！“唿啦”一声，一条红红的鲤鱼儿跌落在草坪上，一朵红红的野花儿飞溅在碧水间，几张红红的脸蛋儿漾开好舒心的笑。
    鱼儿离水，离了自由；花儿离线，自由漂去……
    一阵欢呼过后，鱼竿又斜斜地探过去。水面上又有一朵线儿串着、慢慢转游的小红花……
    红池坝爱美的红鲤鱼哟，你还会去撞那钓饵、那小花么？
    别具匠心的转花鱼竿哟，这主意怎么让那些初涉林区的姑娘想出来了呢……
