Shanxi is world-renowned as the "coal capital," boasting the largest coal reserves, the widest distribution, the most diverse varieties, and the highest quality in the country. Since liberation, Shanxi's coal industry has made significant strides, especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have resolutely implemented the decisions of the Central Committee and the State Council to build Shanxi into an energy and heavy chemical industry base. They have adhered to the policy of reform and opening up, striving to balance the relationship between supporting the nation and revitalizing Shanxi to enrich the people. They have consistently focused on the construction of the energy base as the key to the province's economic development. With the joint efforts of the people of the entire province and the support of the nation, the construction of Shanxi's energy and heavy chemical industry base has taken shape and achieved unprecedented glorious results, making significant contributions to the national economy.

    - Coal production has surged. By 1988, the total coal production had increased by 1.5 times compared to 1978, the amount of coal shipped out of the province had increased by 2.2 times compared to 1978, and the amount of coal provided for export had increased by 17.7 times compared to 1978.

    - The electric power industry has made remarkable progress. The total installed capacity reached 507.08 million kilowatts, an increase of 1.4 times compared to 1978; in 1988, the province's total power generation was 277.74 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 1.6 times compared to 1978.

    - The province's major economic indicators have achieved the first doubling ahead of schedule. By 1988, the province's total social product value increased from 16.25 billion yuan in 1978 to 60.13 billion yuan, and the national income increased from 6.79 billion yuan in 1978 to 23.13 billion yuan.

    - The living standards of the people have significantly improved. The per capita net income of farmers increased from 101.6 yuan in 1978 to 438.7 yuan in 1988, and the per capita living expenses of urban residents increased from 286.3 yuan in 1978 to 846.7 yuan in 1988. There have been improvements in transportation, water supply, gas, and cultural and health facilities.

    - Transportation and logistics are well-developed. The reconstruction of 7 major railways and the opening of the Daqin Railway have increased the capacity to transport coal out of Shanxi. The construction of 5 local railways and 12 provincial highways will form a relatively developed transportation network in the province.

    - Scientific and technological progress has accelerated, and the education sector has developed steadily. The number of scientific and technological personnel in the province has doubled compared to 1978, with 2,555 scientific research achievements awarded at the provincial, ministerial, and national levels. In 1988, the number of college students in the province increased by 1.4 times compared to 1978. Various vocational, technical, and adult education institutions have also developed rapidly, and ordinary primary and secondary schools have been strengthened and improved through adjustments.

Practice has proven that the decision of the Central Committee and the State Council to build Shanxi into an energy and heavy chemical industry base is correct. Building Shanxi into an energy and heavy chemical industry base is not only a necessity for the national construction, but also an important way to fully leverage Shanxi's resource advantages, revitalize Shanxi's economy, and achieve the goal of revitalizing Shanxi and enriching the people.

In recent years, Shanxi has also encountered some difficulties and problems in the construction of the energy and heavy chemical industry base. With the rise in prices, the cost of coal production has increased dramatically, leading to a decline in benefits. Coupled with the low price of coal, coal mines lack the ability to expand production, resulting in a severe shortage of momentum in the province's coal production. With the rapid development of coal and electricity industries, the province's industrial structure has become heavily skewed towards heavy industry, while the consumer goods industry is relatively backward, with 50% of daily consumer goods needing to be imported from other provinces. The large-scale development of coal has also made the tasks of environmental pollution control, water resource compensation, and arable land compensation, as well as the construction of public facilities, increasingly arduous. The decentralized management of coal, the chaotic circulation order, and the excessive intermediaries have also affected the enthusiasm for coal production. Since the Third Plenary Session, although the living standards of the people of Shanxi have improved significantly, the per capita living expenses income still ranks among the lowest in the country.

The Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the construction of Shanxi's energy and heavy chemical industry base. On March 8 of this year, Premier Li Peng presided over an executive meeting of the State Council, which specifically studied the problems in Shanxi's coal production. This is of great significance for the sustained and stable development of Shanxi's coal industry. We are determined to continue to implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, adhere to the fundamental principles of the country, and take the right path to strengthen the country. We will focus on building the energy base, continuing to make greater contributions to the country, and striving to enrich the people of the entire province as soon as possible. We will work hard and strive for greater achievements!

    兴晋富民服务全国
    中共山西省委书记　李立功　省长　王森浩
    山西是举世闻名的“煤炭之乡”，煤炭储量之多、分布之广、品种之全、质地之优均居全国之首。解放后，山西煤炭工业得到长足发展，特别是党的十一届三中全会后，山西省委、省政府坚决贯彻党中央、国务院关于建设山西能源重化工基地的决定，坚持改革开放，努力处理好支援全国和兴晋富民的关系，始终把能源基地建设作为全省经济建设的重点来抓。在全省人民的共同努力和国家的支持下，山西能源重化工基地建设初具规模，取得了前所未有的辉煌成就，为全国的经济建设做出了重大贡献。
    ——煤炭生产迅猛发展。到1988年，煤炭总产量比1978年增长了1.5倍，煤炭的外调量比1978年增长了2.2倍，为国家提供出口煤炭比1978年增长了17.7倍。
    ——电力工业突飞猛进。总装机容量达507.08万千瓦，比1978年增长1.4倍；1988年全省发电量277.74亿千瓦时，比1978年增长1.6倍。
    ——全省国民经济主要指标提前实现第一个翻番。到1988年，全省社会总产值由1978年的162.5亿元增至601.3亿元，国民收入由1978年的67.9亿元增至231.3亿元。
    ——人民生活水平有了较大提高。全省农民人均纯收入由1978年的101.6元提高到1988年的438.7元，城镇居民人均生活费收入由1978年的286.3元上升到1988年的846.7元。交通、供水、煤气和文化、卫生设施都有了一定的改善。
    ——交通运输四通八达。7条铁路干线的改造和大秦铁路通车增加了晋煤外运能力，5条地方铁路和12条出省公路的建设，将使全省形成较发达的交通运输网络。
    ——科技进步加快，教育事业稳步发展。
    全省科技人员比1978年翻了一番，有2555项科研成果获得了省、部级和国家级奖。1988年全省高校在校大学生比1978年增长了1.4倍，各类中专、技工、职业学校和电大、函大等成人教育也迅速发展，普通中小学在调整中得到充实提高。
    实践证明，党中央、国务院关于建设山西能源重化工基地的决策是正确的，建设山西能源重化工基地不仅是国家建设大局的需要，也是充分发挥山西资源优势，振兴山西经济，实现兴晋富民的重要途径。
    近年来，山西在建设能源重化工基地中也遇到了一些困难和问题。随着物价上涨，煤炭生产成本剧增，效益下降，加之煤炭价格低，煤矿缺乏扩大再生产的能力，全省煤炭生产后劲严重不足；随着煤炭、电力等工业的迅速发展，我省产业结构出现了重工业畸重的局面，消费品工业相对落后，50％的日用消费品需要从外省调入；煤炭大规模开发，也使我省环境污染治理、水资源和耕地补偿以及公用设施建设等任务日益繁重；煤炭管理体制分散，流通秩序混乱，中间盘剥多，也影响了煤矿生产的积极性。三中全会以来，尽管山西人民的生活水平有了较大提高，但人均生活费收入仍位居全国后列。
    党中央、国务院十分重视山西能源重化工基地建设。今年3月8日，李鹏总理主持国务院办公会议，专门研究了山西煤炭生产中的问题，这对我省煤炭工业持续稳定发展具有重要意义。我们决心继续贯彻党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，坚持立国之本，走好强国之路，把搞好能源基地建设、继续为国家多做贡献、尽快使全省人民富裕起来作为山西党政领导的主要职责，艰苦奋斗，努力工作，争取更大的成绩！
