	Eating a banquet at the bedside is a satirical sketch by Xú Jìn, originally published in "Satire and Humor." The sketch pokes fun at the extravagant and wasteful practices that were prevalent in some segments of Chinese society during the late 1980s. The title itself is a play on words, referring to the absurdity of indulging in lavish feasts while lying in bed, symbolizing a life of excessive comfort and indulgence.

	The sketch likely delves into the themes of corruption, excess, and the disparity between the privileged few and the common people. It reflects the societal concerns and criticisms that were emerging during a time of rapid economic changes and social transformations in China. The humor in the sketch serves as a commentary on the moral and ethical issues that were being debated in the public sphere.

	The publication of such satirical pieces in newspapers like "The People's Daily" indicates the government's acknowledgment of the need to address and critique social issues, even if it was done in a subtle and humorous manner. It also shows the role of satire in Chinese literature and media as a tool for social commentary and reform.
