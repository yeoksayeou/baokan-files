Shandong Province's enterprise groups have developed from their initial stages to a period of vigorous growth. So far, 98 enterprise groups have been approved and established by municipal and prefectural-level departments, with over 2,000 member units participating in these groups.

Shandong Province is actively promoting the shareholding system to facilitate the integrated management of enterprise group assets. Some groups have established joint-stock limited companies to develop their enterprise groups, while others have expanded their core layers by establishing limited liability companies. Some groups have converted all enterprise assets into shares to form joint-stock limited companies, while others have used industrial property rights as shares to establish new enterprises.

They have introduced the merger mechanism to strengthen the group's capabilities during the process of adjusting enterprise structures. For example, the Qingqi Group merged with the Yimeng Motorcycle Factory at the end of 1987, transforming it into the Qingqi Group Yinan Branch. The branch's personnel, finances, materials, production, supply, and sales are all managed by the group. After the merger, the Yinan Branch's output value in 1988 increased by 300% compared to the previous year, profits increased by 750%, and labor productivity increased by 210%.

Contracting and leasing enterprises are also effective measures to strengthen the group's capabilities.

After the enterprise groups have grown stronger, they have begun to compete with global powers. The Baima Machinery Enterprise Group, established in 1987, initially set a strategic goal of becoming a concentrated and outward-looking enterprise group. Over the years, they have developed single-board microcomputers, economic, multifunctional, and fully functional four-tier numerical control lathes through external introductions and internal connections. They have also collaborated with three companies from Japan, West Germany, and the United States to produce two types of numerical control lathes and one machining center. They have proposed the policy of "competing in the international market and letting go of the domestic market" and, through the combination of industry and trade and technology and trade, have paved a new path to open up the international market. Over the years, this group's foreign exchange earnings from exports have consistently ranked at the forefront of the industry nationwide.

    积极推行股份制　引入兼并机制
    山东企业集团蓬勃发展
    新华社青岛8月6日电  （记者杨凤山）山东省企业集团从初创走向蓬勃发展。到目前为止，经市、地以上部门批准成立的企业集团达98家，参加集团的成员单位两千多家。
    山东省积极推行股份制，促进企业集团资产经营一体化。有的通过创办股份有限公司来发展企业集团，有的则以创办有限责任公司的形式扩大集团的紧密层；有的是各企业资产全部折成股份组成股份有限公司，有的则利用工业产权做为股份创办新企业。
    他们引入兼并机制，在调整企业结构中壮大集团实力。如轻骑集团1987年底兼并了沂蒙摩托车厂，将其改为轻骑集团沂南分厂，分厂的人、财、物、产、供、销由集团统一管理。兼并后，沂南分厂1988年实现产值比上年增长3倍，实现利润增长7.5倍，全员劳动生产率增长2.1倍。
    集团承包企业、租赁企业，也是发展集团实力的一项有效措施。
    企业集团壮大以后，开始与世界强手进行竞争。1987年成立的白马机械企业联合公司，一开始就确定了办成一个集约式外向型企业集团的战略目标。几年来，他们通过外引内联，自行研制出单板微机、经济型、多功能和全功能四个档次的数控车床，并与日本、联邦德国、美国的三家公司联合生产出两种数控车床，一种加工中心。他们还提出“争国际市场，让国内市场”的方针，通过工贸结合、技贸结合，走出了一条开拓国际市场的新路子。几年来，这个集团的出口创汇额一直在全国同行业中名列前茅。
