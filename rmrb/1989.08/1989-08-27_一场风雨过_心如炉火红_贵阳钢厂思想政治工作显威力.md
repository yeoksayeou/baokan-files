This spring and summer, the Guiyang Steel Plant was subjected to five consecutive disruptions by protesting students. They gave speeches in the factory area, distributed leaflets, and posted slogans, demanding that workers donate money, go on strike, and join protests. None of the 10,000 workers in the factory listened to them. A worker from the second rolling mill wrote on a steel ingot: “Without national stability, there is no factory efficiency, and without factory efficiency, there is no personal benefit.” This reflects the sentiments of the workers at Guiyang Steel.

At Guiyang Steel, there is a popular slogan: “Seek benefits from ideological and political work.” Factory director Tian Zhongxue manages the factory by relying on three pillars: the Party committee, the workers' congress, and the masses. Party secretary Ren Liang is straightforward: “Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles is our lifeline. I don’t believe that enthusiasm can be bought with money.” Both often repeat, “It’s your field, my land, but we must work together.” The factory incorporates ideological and political work into the contract responsibility system, planning, arranging, inspecting, evaluating, and rewarding it alongside production and operations. For a while, although there was a trend of “diminishing” and “reforming” ideological work, the factory strengthened its political work departments, systematically training 285 political workers, evaluating their titles, and allocating 3 million yuan for political work rewards.

With this advantage, while other units struggle to mobilize workers and organize production without money, the situation here is different. In October last year, the forging mill faced energy shortages and had to complete 42% of the monthly task in the last five days of the month. The 134 workers in the front section worked 16 hours a day, knowing there would be no bonuses or overtime pay, but not a single person gave up.

Guiyang Steel has over 2,100 party members, nearly a quarter of the workforce. Increasingly, the masses respect the communists around them.

“Respect” is earned through sweat and sincerity. Communist Party member Lang Mengjun led his team of five to produce over 8,000 tons of steel a year, setting a new factory record and earning 310,000 yuan. Communist Party member Zhao Chuangli, with only a junior high school education, completed over a dozen equipment modification projects. Communist Party member Deng Minggao, over the past two years, led his team to produce over a thousand furnaces of steel without any chemical defects...

Fulfilling duties and making contributions have become the norm among party members at Guiyang Steel. The entire factory implements a party member responsibility system, with party members active in 593 responsibility areas, setting examples and inspiring the masses. Since 1985, over 800 outstanding party members have emerged. Every year, 60% of the “five-good workers” are party members. In recent years, over 300 workers have actively applied to join the party.

“Great righteousness begins with oneself.” The party secretary, upon arriving at the factory, set three rules: do not ask for a house; do not bring anyone; do not arrange for relatives or children. The factory director holds the sole authority to approve self-produced and self-sold steel materials, but even when relatives from his hometown ask for steel, he turns them down.

Guiyang Steel is advancing and innovating through reform. Since 1984, it has received over a hundred awards from the state, ministries, provinces, bureaus, and cities. In March of this year, Guiyang Steel was honored as a “National Excellent Enterprise in Ideological and Political Work.”

    一场风雨过　心如炉火红
    ——贵阳钢厂思想政治工作显威力
    张兴
    今年春夏之交，贵阳钢厂先后受到游行学生的5次冲击，他们在厂区发表演说，散发传单，张贴标语，要求工人捐款、罢工、游行。厂里万名职工没有人听他们的。二轧分厂一名职工在钢锭上写下一句话：“国无安宁，厂无效益，我无利益。”这就是贵钢人的心声。
    在贵钢，流行一句口号：“向思想政治工作要效益”。厂长田忠学治厂坚持“三依靠”：依靠党委、职代会和群众。党委书记任谅怀快人快语：“坚持四项基本原则是我们的生命线。我不信积极性是靠钱买得来的。”两人常常重复一句话：“啥你的田，我的地，咱们的劲得拧在一起。”该厂把思想政治工作纳入承包责任制，与生产经营一道计划、布置、检查、考核和评比表彰。有一阵，虽然吹起了一股“淡化”、“改造”之风，工厂仍然强化了政工部门，系统地对285名政工干部进行培训，评定了职称，还拨出30万元作政工奖励基金。
    靠了这个优势，当一些单位没有钱就无法调度工人、组织生产时，这里却是另一番景象。去年10月份，锻钢分厂因能源吃紧，要在月末5天完成月任务的42％，前部工段134名职工每天连续工作16个小时，明知没有奖金、加班费，可没有一个打退堂鼓。
    贵钢有2100多名党员，将近占职工人数的1／4。现在，越来越多的群众对身边的共产党员“服气”。
    “服气”是用汗水和真诚换来的。共产党员郎梦军，带领全班5人年产钢8000多吨，刷新厂纪录，创收31万元；共产党员赵传礼，只有初中文化，却相继完成10多项设备改造项目；共产党员邓明高，两年来带领全班炼钢千余炉，无一化学废次品……
    尽义务、比贡献在贵钢党员中蔚成风气。全厂推行了党员责任制，党员分别在593个责任区内开展活动，发挥模范带头作用，群众受到感召。1985年以来，全厂涌现出800多名优秀党员。每年评“五好职工”，党员要占60％以上。近年来，有300多名职工积极申请入党。
    “浩然正气自我始。”党委书记一到厂就约法三章：暂不要房子；不带任何人；不塞亲属子女。厂长手握全厂唯一一支能批自产自销钢材的笔，可是，家乡亲人来要点钢材，也给顶了回去。
    贵钢在改革中奋进开拓，自1984年以来，已百余次获得国家、部、省、厅、市奖励。今年3月，贵阳钢厂获得“全国思想政治工作优秀企业”称誉。
