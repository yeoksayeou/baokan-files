Editor's Note:

In our country, from the central government to local authorities, the letters and visits departments of party and government organs receive letters from the masses and handle visits from the masses every day. Through these voices from all directions, the party and government understand the revelations, suggestions, hopes, inquiries, praises, criticisms, and exposures from millions of people regarding various phenomena in social life; they also understand the applications, appeals, and demands of the people regarding their own rights and interests.

Letters and visits work begins here. Generally speaking, the letters and visits from the people reflect socialist democracy, demonstrate the enhanced ability of the people to participate in politics, and indicate the strengthening of citizens' awareness of protecting their own rights and interests. Any leading organs, functional departments, and leaders who maintain close ties with the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly will surely attach importance to letters and visits work.

Seriously handling letters and visits can examine the work situation of a region or department, identify problems in one's own or subordinate work, formulate targeted measures, improve work, make amends for mistakes, correct errors, and better serve the people. At the same time, through comprehensive analysis of letters and visits dynamics, improve situation forecasting and proactive service, and solve problems in their infancy.

Handling letters and visits well is a concrete manifestation of doing practical things for the people. We should strive to ensure that every letter and visit has a follow-up, every issue has a resolution, and the practical difficulties of the people are solved, providing high-quality services to the people, so that the people have more trust in the party and government. Letters and visits work must avoid bureaucratism, irresponsibility, and the bad habit of "passing the buck." It must also avoid the attitude of "letting things drop like a stone."

To fully utilize the role of letters and visits work in connecting with the masses, democratic supervision, mediating social conflicts, reflecting public opinion, and providing decision-making advice, various levels of party and government organs should establish and improve the system of letters and visits work, strengthen supervision and inspection work, and not just say nice things on the surface but do nothing in reality. In the work, transparency must be increased, and the process and results of handling should be made public, so that the people can understand the party and government and gain the support and understanding of the people.

As a letter and visit writer, one should correctly use the rights and obligations granted by the law, boldly exercise the right to criticize and suggest, the right to petition and appeal, the right to expose and accuse, and the right to know. At the same time, one must comply with the laws, regulations, and policies of the state, maintain the normal work order of party and government organs, and truthfully reflect the situation. One should use civilized language and visit in a civilized manner.

    发挥信访工作的作用
    在我国，从中央到地方，党政机关的信访部门每天都会收到群众来信，接待群众来访。从这些来自四面八方的信访人的声音中，党和政府了解到了千百万群众对社会生活中各种现象的揭示、建议、希望、咨询、表扬、批评、揭发；对自己权益的申请、申诉、要求。
    信访工作就从这里开始了。人民群众的来信来访，从总体上讲，它是社会主义民主的具体反映，是人民群众参政议政能力提高的体现，也是公民对维护自己权益意识的增强。凡是密切联系群众，全心全意为人民服务的领导机关、职能部门和领导干部，也必然会重视信访工作。
    认真处理来信来访，可以检验本地区本部门的工作情况，找出自己或下级工作中存在的问题，有针对性地制订措施，改进工作，弥补过失，纠正失误，更好地为群众服务。同时，通过对信访动态的综合分析，搞好情况预测、超前服务，把问题解决在萌芽状态。
    处理好来信来访，是为群众办好实事的具体体现。我们要力争做到件件有着落，事事有结果，解决群众的实际困难，为群众提供优质服务，使人民群众对党和政府更加信赖。信访工作要切忌官僚主义、不负责任、“踢皮球”的恶劣作风，切忌“石沉大海”的办事态度。
    为了充分发挥信访工作联系群众、民主监督、调解社会矛盾、反馈民意、决策参谋的作用，各级党政机关在建立健全信访工作的制度上，加强监督检查工作，不要当面说得好听，实际又不去做。工作中一定要增加透明度，公开处理过程和处理结果，让群众了解党和政府，取得群众的支持和理解。
    作为信访人，要正确运用法律赋予自己的权利和义务，理直气壮地行使批评建议权、请求申诉权、检举控告权、了解获知权。同时，又必须遵守国家法律、法令和政策，维护党政机关的正常工作秩序，如实反映情况。要文明用语，文明上访。
