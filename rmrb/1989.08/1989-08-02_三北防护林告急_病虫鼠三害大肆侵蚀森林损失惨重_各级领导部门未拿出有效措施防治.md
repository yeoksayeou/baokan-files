Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 2nd.

A "silent forest fire" of pests, insects, and rodents is ravaging China's Three-North Shelterbelt. Data from relevant departments show that the severely affected area has reached 4.66 million hectares, which is 5.6 times larger than the area burned in the Great Daxinganling Fire.

The alarming news from various regions in the Three-North area is shocking. According to the Three-North Shelterbelt Construction Bureau of the State Forestry Administration, in the Northwest region, the light-shouldered pine sawyer and yellow-spotted pine sawyer have swept through 1.44 million hectares of forests. In Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, over 100 counties have seen 70 million trees severely affected, with at least 10 million trees dead, resulting in direct economic losses of 150 million yuan.

In the North China region, over 1 million acres of artificial forests in Inner Mongolia have been affected by the sand date moth. In Shanxi Province, over 5 million acres of forests have been damaged by the Chinese mole.

In the Northeast region, Liaoning Province has 7 million acres of artificial pine forests, with 2 million acres affected by the pine caterpillar. In Heilongjiang, over the past decade, the area of artificial forests affected by pests, insects, and rodents has reached 20.31 million acres, equivalent to 1.5 times the area of afforestation.

Forestry workers have repeatedly called out: pest, insect, and rodent damage has become the primary natural disaster in forestry, causing more damage than fires and illegal logging. However, relevant government departments have yet to take effective measures to control the situation.

Relevant officials pointed out that in the past, the national budget for pest, insect, and rodent control in the Three-North Shelterbelt was already limited, and in recent years, it has been further reduced. Provincial investments have also significantly decreased, with some provinces having no investment in this area. There is a lack of both funds and pesticides.

    三北防护林告急
    病虫鼠三害大肆侵蚀森林损失惨重
    各级领导部门未拿出有效措施防治
    新华社银川8月2日电  （通讯员李熊、记者王漫沧）一场被称之为“不冒烟”的森林大火——病、虫、鼠害正在侵蚀我国三北防护林。有关部门提供的数据表明，严重受灾面积已达466万公顷，比大兴安岭特大火灾的过火面积还大5.6倍。
    “三北”地区各地告急的消息是令人震惊的。据林业部三北防护林建设局汇总：西北地区，光肩星天牛和黄斑星天牛已席卷了144万余公顷树林。陕、甘、宁100多个县的7000多万株树木发病严重，至少已有1000万株枯死，直接经济损失1.5亿元。
    华北地区的内蒙古自治区100多万亩人工林受沙枣尺蛾危害。山西省500多万亩林木受中华鼢鼠危害。
    东北地区的辽宁省共有人工松树林700万亩，仅松毛虫为害的面积已达200万亩。黑龙江近10年发生病虫鼠害的人工林面积已达2031万亩，相当于造林保存面积的1.5倍……
    广大林业工作者已经多次疾呼：病虫鼠害已成为林业自然灾害之首，它所造成的损失已大大超过火灾和乱砍滥伐。但是各级领导部门至今还未采取有效措施予以防治。
    有关人士指出，过去国家给三北防护林的病虫鼠害防治经费就不多，最近几年还一减再减。各省的投资也大大减少，有些省竟无这方面的投资。既无经费也缺农药。
