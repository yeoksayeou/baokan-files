Since August, Harbin has been experiencing high temperatures, and the number of buses heading to the Songhua River has increased.

At noon, buses loaded with swimmers gather by the river. Along the several miles of riverbank from Jiuzhan to the Songhua River Bridge, there are about a hundred large buses, medium-sized vans, jeeps, security motorcycles, and engineering rescue vehicles parked. Many of these vehicles belong to provincial and municipal government agencies.

At around 2 PM on August 8, near Jiuzhan, a reporter asked a van driver, "Do you come every day?" The driver replied, "For over a month now." Upon learning that the reporter was a journalist, he quickly added, "We just come here for lunch breaks. Some people from certain agencies swim the entire afternoon."

A station manager at Jiuzhan told the reporter, "This area by the river is already congested with vehicles, and there have been several car accidents. To control the vehicles, large cars are charged 10 yuan, and small cars 6 yuan, but it's still not enough. Every day, there are one to two thousand vehicles passing through, and more than 60% of them are official vehicles bringing people to swim."

A man selling cigarettes nearby chimed in, "Only those working in large government agencies have this privilege. Ordinary people come to swim either by bicycle or public bus."

An elderly cadre walking by said, "Harbin's gasoline supply is quite tight. How much fuel do all these cars consume? The political impact is incalculable." A female teacher added, "If this continues, how can we talk about integrity?"

    松花江畔一怪事：
    公车穿梭为哪桩  机关干部游泳忙
    新华社哈尔滨8月8日电　（记者徐江善）8月以来，哈尔滨市进入高温天气，开往松花江畔的公车也多了起来。
    中午载着游泳者的公车云集江畔，仅九站至松花江大桥数里长的江边停着的大型客车、中型面包车、吉普车、警备摩托车、工程抢险车就有百台左右。其中许多是省市机关的车辆。
    8日下午2时许，在九站附近，记者问一位面包车司机：“天天来吗？”司机答：
  “半个多月了。”得知是记者，他忙说：“我们只是午休来，有的机关的一些人整个下午都游泳。”
    九站管理站一位站长告诉记者：“这一带江边已车满为患，发生好几起撞车事故了。为了控制车辆，大车收费10元，小车收费6元，仍然挡不住。每天过往车辆一二千台，60％以上是拉人来游泳的公车。”
    旁边摆烟摊的男人接过话茬：“只有在大机关里干事的才有这个待遇，老百姓来游泳，不是骑自行车，就是坐公共汽车。”
    正在散步的一位老干部说：“哈尔滨的汽油供应相当紧张，这么多车要耗费多少油啊！而造成的政治影响是无法用钱计算的。”一位女教师说：“要是都这个样，廉政不成了空话吗？”
