Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, said that in striking economic crimes, we must be severe when we are severe and lenient when we are lenient, fully embodying the Party's consistent policy of leniency to those who confess and severity to those who resist.

Li Ximing made these remarks at a conference of major leaders of districts, counties, and bureaus in Beijing held today.

Li Ximing pointed out at the meeting that in recent years, a very bad practice has been the protection of one's own. Some leaders fear that if problems are found in their units, it will damage their reputation, and they do not strike hard at economic crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, and speculation, and some even cover up for them. This is a manifestation of political corruption.

Meng Zhiyuan, a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC in charge of this work, said at the meeting that striking economic crimes is an important part of fighting corruption and promoting clean governance. We must not have a complacent attitude towards issues unrelated to our own units. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, we should, in accordance with the principle of being few but precise, immediately establish special agencies to be responsible for specific work; we should vigorously publicize the spirit of the central government's circular, mobilize the masses to expose and report, do targeted ideological work on key individuals, eliminate their sense of luck, and encourage those with problems to take the road of confession and self-repentation.

Vice Premier and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong presided over today's meeting.

    李锡铭在北京市干部大会上说
    打击经济犯罪宽严有度
    一些领导护短包庇是政治腐败的表现
    据新华社北京8月25日电  （记者黄智敏、王跃华）中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭说，在打击经济犯罪中，要严就严出个样子来，宽也宽出个样子来，充分体现我们党一贯坚持的坦白从宽、抗拒从严的政策。
    李锡铭是在今天召开的北京市区县局主要领导干部大会上讲这番话的。
    李锡铭在会上指出，这些年来，一个很不好的风气就是护短。有些领导怕自己单位查出问题来有损名誉，对贪污、受贿、投机倒把等经济犯罪打击不力，甚至有的进行包庇，这是政治上腐败的一种表现。
    专门负责这项工作的北京市委常委孟志元在会上说，打击经济犯罪是反对腐败、搞好廉政建设的重要内容。不能有与本单位无关的麻痹思想。要在各级党委领导下，本着少而精的原则立即成立专门机构负责具体工作；要大力宣传中央通告精神，发动群众检举揭发，有针对性地做好重点人的思想工作，消除其侥幸心理，促使有问题的人走自首坦白的道路。
    国务委员、北京市市长陈希同主持了今天的会议。
