Since April, part-time prosecutors in Yuanyang County of our city have cooperated with the prosecution work, reporting 11 cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other criminal clues. The procuratorial organs have initiated investigations into 5 of these cases.

The part-time prosecutors in this county have taken the opportunity to visit enterprises and institutions and go to the countryside to work, conducting investigations and research among the masses. They have effectively cracked down on criminal activities in the economic sphere. For example, the part-time prosecutor of the county fertilizer factory reported a criminal clue involving embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds totaling over 40,000 yuan. The county procuratorate initiated an investigation. Through verification, the criminals were promptly dealt with, the illicit funds were recovered, and they received commendations from higher authorities.

    走访群众　了解线索　揭发犯罪
    4月份以来，我市原阳县兼职检察人员配合检察工作，共举报贪污、受贿等犯罪线索11起。检察机关立案侦查5起。
    这个县兼职检察人员利用去企事业单位和下乡工作的机会走访群众，开展调查研究，有效地打击了经济领域的犯罪活动。如县化肥厂检察室兼职检察人员举报的贪污、挪用公款4万多元的经济犯罪线索，被县检察院立案侦查。通过查证，及时打击了罪犯，追缴了赃款，受到了上级的通报表扬。
