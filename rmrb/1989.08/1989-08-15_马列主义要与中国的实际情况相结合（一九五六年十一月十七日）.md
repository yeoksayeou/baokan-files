Editors' Note: This article is excerpted from "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1938-1965)" edited and published by the Editorial Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It is a response by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to the first question raised by international youth representatives during his meeting with them on November 17, 1956. It is still highly relevant today. With the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it is published here in advance.

Friends, you asked: What is the meaning of a member of the Communist Party of China? Who decides which principles of international classical communism are applicable to China?

Regarding this question, if you are interested in a detailed understanding, you can refer to the Party Constitution adopted at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The general principles and the section on party members in the Constitution can answer this question. The "Report on the Amendment of the Party Constitution" can also explain this question. In brief, the meaning or task of a member of the Communist Party of China can be summarized in two sentences: to serve the people wholeheartedly and to make the interests of the people the highest criterion for every party member. The goal is to achieve socialism and communism. According to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, China, before the completion of the democratic revolution, had to first complete the bourgeois democratic revolution. After the completion of the democratic revolution, we are now building socialism and will eventually develop from socialism to communism. This will lead the Chinese people to a society free from exploitation and oppression, building a happy life under communism. This is the meaning and task of a member of the Communist Party of China. Of course, for the Communist Party of China, with 11 million members, not all or even most have reached this standard. The party's task is to gradually raise the consciousness of its members so that they become genuine communists in thought and action. The Communist Party of China has made this a constant task. There are many party members from peasant backgrounds in the Communist Party of China. Soon after the party was founded, a large number of peasants joined. They joined to oppose imperialism and feudalism and to obtain land, which can be said to be the demands of the democratic revolution, not initially having the demand for socialism. For example, regarding agricultural cooperativization, it was only through education and training that this demand gradually emerged. Now, most peasants clearly understand that they need to follow the socialist path and cooperativize. Therefore, the standard for a communist party member is not something that can be achieved overnight. A communist party member, first of all, is an ordinary person, second, is an advanced element among ordinary people. However, there are also communist party members who are even more backward than ordinary people.

Regarding who decides which principles of international classical communism are applicable to China, 11 years ago, the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China established the principle that the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism must be combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution to guide our revolution and construction. This principle was summarized by our party and Comrade Mao Zedong based on the experiences of past successes and failures, and was affirmed at the Seventh and Eighth Party Congresses. Of course, this is only a principle, and its application will encounter many specific problems. A country's problems are multifaceted, whether in the revolutionary period or the construction period, how to combine Marxism-Leninism with the specific circumstances of each period is a problem that needs to be constantly solved. This problem needs to be discussed and decided by the Party Congress, and during the intersession period, it needs to be discussed and decided by the Central Committee. Once the problem is decided, party members need to be good at solving it in practical work. First, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of cadres need to understand this principle, and then the principle can be implemented.

The statement that the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism must be combined with the specific realities of one's own country is itself a universal truth. It contains two aspects: one is the universal truth, and the other is the combination with the specific realities of one's own country. We have always believed that neither aspect can be ignored. In the view of the Communist Party of China, there is such a universal truth: to eliminate feudalism and capitalism and achieve socialism, and in the future, to achieve communism. Can we not take the path of socialism? No, we cannot. If we abandon this universal truth and do not achieve socialism, then the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China would not need to exist. However, how can China more quickly eliminate feudalism and capitalism and achieve socialism and communism? This requires studying the characteristics of one's own country. If we ignore the characteristics of our own country and blindly copy foreign things, this universal truth cannot be realized. Friends, you have heard about the introduction of the socialist transformation of China's capitalist industry and commerce in various places, which is the issue of combining universal truth with China's reality. The universal truth is to eliminate capitalism, eliminate exploitation, and achieve socialism. Without this universal truth, we cannot talk about the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, which would mean taking the capitalist road instead of the socialist road. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the path we have taken today to transform capitalist industry and commerce is one that Lenin thought of, but he did not achieve it. We have adopted the method of peaceful transformation for capitalist industry and commerce. Practice has proven that this approach has not only not destroyed our production but has also promoted its development, eliminating capitalism and educating the bourgeoisie. This is a relatively good method. If the universal truth is not combined with China's reality, or if it is not combined well, then it will cause great losses. This is the case with the socialist transformation of agriculture and other aspects.

On the issue of combining universal truth with specific reality, our party has suffered many setbacks in the past, and since then, we have always focused on opposing subjectivism. Opposing subjectivism has two aspects: opposing dogmatism and opposing empiricism. Dogmatism is knowing only the words of Marxism-Leninism and not applying them based on specific circumstances, which has caused our revolution to suffer failures and setbacks. Empiricism is seeing only some specific practices, only seeing the experiences of one country, one place, or one time, without seeing the principles of Marxism-Leninism. We oppose both.

I would also like to tell friends that based on our experience, combining universal truth with specific reality is not easy. The Communist Party of China often makes mistakes. However, we pay attention to and study the causes of mistakes and correct them in a timely manner. Chairman Mao said, people need to wash their faces regularly, and houses need to be cleaned regularly. The party is the same; it needs to correct mistakes regularly. I myself often make mistakes. Everyone is like this. Chairman Mao often says that he also makes mistakes. However, we all know that his mistakes are fewer than ours. Everyone will make mistakes, and there is no one who never makes mistakes.

    马列主义要与中国的实际情况相结合
    （一九五六年十一月十七日）
    邓小平
    《求是》杂志编者按：本文选自中共中央文献编辑委员会编辑、出版的《邓小平文选》（1938—1965年）。这是邓小平同志1956年11月17日会见国际青年代表团时对他们所提第一个问题的回答，今天读来仍有十分重要的现实意义。现征得中共中央文献研究室同意，提前在此发表。
    朋友们提出：中国共产党员的含意是什么？谁来决定国际古典的共产主义的原则中哪些是适合于中国的？
    关于这个问题，如果朋友们愿意详细了解的话，可以看看中国共产党第八次全国代表大会通过的党章，党章中总纲和党员两个部分可以回答这个问题。《关于修改党的章程的报告》也可以说明这个问题。中国共产党员的含意或任务，如果用概括的语言来说，只有两句话：全心全意为人民服务，一切以人民利益作为每一个党员的最高准绳。他的目的是要实现社会主义、共产主义。根据马克思列宁主义的原则，中国在过去民主革命没有完成的时候，首先要完成资产阶级民主革命，民主革命完成以后，现在要建设社会主义，将来再由社会主义发展到共产主义。这样就能把中国人民引导到完全脱离剥削和压迫的社会，建设共产主义的幸福生活。这就是中国共产党员的含意和任务。当然，对于中国共产党来说，有一千一百万党员，还不是全部或大多数都已达到这样的标准。党的任务是要一步一步地提高党员的觉悟，使他们在思想上行动上成为名副其实的共产党员。中国共产党把这一个任务作为自己的经常任务。中国共产党内农民出身的党员很多，建党不久就有大量农民入党。他们入党是为了反对帝国主义、封建主义，是为了得到土地，可以说还是民主革命的要求，并不是当初就有社会主义的要求。比如说，对农业合作化，也是经过教育和锻炼才逐步有这种要求，现在大部分农民都明确了要走社会主义的道路，要合作化。所以共产党员的标准不是一下就能达到的。一个共产党员，第一，他是普通人，第二，他是普通人中的先进分子。但是也有比普通人还要落后的共产党员。
    关于谁来决定国际古典的共产主义的原则中哪些适用于中国。11年前，中国共产党第七次全国代表大会确定了这样的原则，即马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合，以此来指导我国的革命，指导我国的建设。这个原则是我们党和毛泽东同志根据过去革命中失败和成功的经验总结起来，并在第七、第八两次党代表大会上加以肯定的。当然，这只是一个原则，原则的运用还会遇到许多具体问题。一个国家的问题是多方面的，不论是革命时期还是建设时期，如何使马克思列宁主义与各个时期的具体情况相结合，这是一个需要不断解决的问题。这个问题需要党的代表大会来讨论决定，在代表大会闭会期间由中央委员会讨论决定。问题决定好了，还需要党员善于在实际工作中去解决。首先要几万、几十万骨干懂得这条原则，这条原则才会得到实行。
    马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与本国的具体实际相结合，这句话本身就是普遍真理。它包含两个方面，一方面叫普遍真理，另一方面叫结合本国实际。我们历来认为丢开任何一面都不行。在我们中国共产党看来，普遍真理有这样一条，就是消灭封建主义、资本主义，实现社会主义，将来还要实现共产主义。能不能不走社会主义的道路呢？不能。如果离开了这条普遍真理，不实现社会主义，那么中华人民共和国和中国共产党就不要存在了。但是，中国怎样才能比较快地消灭封建主义、资本主义，实现社会主义和共产主义呢？这就必须研究本国的特点。离开本国的特点去硬搬外国的东西，这条普遍真理就不能实现。各位朋友在各地都听到过关于中国资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题的介绍，这就是普遍真理与中国的实际相结合的问题。普遍真理就是要消灭资本主义，消灭剥削，实现社会主义，离开了这条普遍真理就谈不上对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，那就是走资本主义的道路而不是走社会主义的道路。这是一方面。另一方面，我们今天对资本主义工商业改造所走的道路，是列宁所想过的，但是列宁没有能实现。我们对资本主义工商业采用了和平改造的办法。实践证明，这样做的结果，我们的生产不仅没有受到破坏，而且得到了发展，既消灭了资本主义，又教育了资产阶级。这是比较好的办法。如果普遍真理不与中国的实际相结合，或者结合得不好，那末就会造成很大的损失。像农业社会主义改造，以及其他各个方面，都有这个问题。
    在普遍真理与具体实际相结合这个问题上，我们党过去吃过许多亏，以后就一直抓住反对主观主义这一条。反对主观主义有两个方面，即反对教条主义和反对经验主义。教条主义，就是只知道马克思列宁主义的词句，不从具体情况出发来运用，它使我国的革命遭受过失败和挫折。经验主义，就是只看到一些具体实践，只看到一国一地一时的经验，没有看到马克思列宁主义的原则。两者我们都反对。
    我还想向朋友们讲一点，根据我们的经验，普遍真理与具体实际，二者结合很不容易。中国共产党也经常犯错误。但是我们注意和研究犯错误的原因，及时改正。毛主席说，人要经常洗脸，房子要经常打扫，党也是这样，要经常改正错误。我自己也常常犯错误。每个人都是这样。毛主席还常常说，他也经常犯错误。不过我们都知道他的错误比我们少。任何人都会犯错误，绝对不犯错误的人是没有的。
