Instigating chaos is generally an unserious and reckless act, akin to the mischief of a mob. Those who instigate chaos often mimic parrots, not understanding what is happening, yet they raise their voices, spitting and shouting, creating a cacophony that spreads from one person to ten, then to a hundred, resulting in a chaotic and frenzied atmosphere. It resembles hysteria and convulsions.

The disease of instigating chaos is both common and widespread. Its sufferers include both street ruffians and political mediocrities; illiterate fools and erudite scholars; those who whistle, boo, throw rotten eggs, and make strange noises in theaters, and those who jeer at referees and support the opposing team in stadiums, even to the point of fighting; there are also cunning and malicious schemers, as well as many good people who are deceived and used as pawns.

When Yin, Xia, and Pan Geng moved their capitals, it was a good thing, but the scholars opposed it, and the common people followed suit, creating a chaotic situation. Look at the television drama "Yuan Chonghuan"—the chaos was so intense that people spat on his face. Did they know what was happening? During the "Cultural Revolution" turmoil, today they criticized Zhang San, and tomorrow they criticized Li Si. Without thinking or using their brains, they closed their eyes and followed the crowd. They shouted slogans without understanding the issues, just to create noise and confusion.

In this turmoil, which started as a student movement and escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, many people followed the crowd. It seemed as if their brains were on someone else's shoulders. Whatever others said to oppose, attack, or demand, they repeated without understanding the origins and secrets of the events. They were led like puppets to participate in protests, some even blocking military vehicles and surrounding soldiers, throwing bricks and stones, and falling into the abyss!

Those who instigate chaos are not all bad people; most are good people who are misled. But the leaders or main instigators have different intentions. Some aim to achieve unspoken political goals, others to vent their private grievances and dissatisfaction, or to create chaos and terror in society. Some want to do evil but hide in the shadows, using the crowd to create trouble, spreading rumors, slandering, deceiving, and inciting chaos. They use the crowd as both weapons and shields, aiming to achieve their goals of disruption while hoping to escape responsibility under the guise of "the law does not punish the crowd."

This disease of instigating chaos is not limited to China; it is also prevalent abroad, with mutual responses. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, some anti-communist media abroad could not help but join in the chaos, and many other media followed suit without understanding the facts, unwittingly creating a chorus of anti-China sentiment. However, facts cannot be distorted. As the truth comes to light, those who joined the chorus ended up hurting themselves.

People should remain calm and rational. They should think independently and have insightful views. Facts are the most convincing. If one has ideas, opinions, and suggestions, they can be expressed through proper channels and within the framework of democracy and the rule of law. One should not be swayed by rumors or blindly follow others, becoming pawns in the hands of conspirators, used as weapons or shields.

The disease of instigating chaos harms both individuals and the nation. It is hoped that people will reflect and cure themselves of this disease. If they can recover, even if they have suffered this time, they will not relapse in the future, turning a bad experience into a good one.

### “起哄病”

    “起哄病”
    李庚辰
    起哄，大抵是不严肃的胡闹台，是乌合之众的恶作剧。起哄的大多如鹦鹉学舌，自己并未弄清咋回事儿，就扯起嗓子，满口飞沫，呜呜呀呀，吵嚷吼叫，一传十，十传百，乱哄哄，嗷嗷叫，造成一窝蜂的音响效果。形似歇斯底里和抽风症。
    起哄病既是常见病，又是多发病。患者既有市井无赖，也有政治庸人；有目不识丁的白痴，也有满腹经纶的墨客；有剧场里吹口哨、鼓倒掌、扔臭蛋、发怪叫，也有球场里嘘裁判、哄客队，甚至大打出手的；有阴险歹毒、呼风唤雨的奸邪黑手，也有上当受骗、被人当枪使的许多好人。
    殷夏盘庚迁都，本是好事，可士大夫一反对，老百姓也跟着叫，瞎起哄嘛！电视剧《袁崇焕》，你看那起哄的多“激烈”，竟往他脸上吐唾沫，他们知道嘛事儿！“文革”内乱时，今天批张三，一窝风批张三的大字报满天飞；明天倒李四，眨眼间揭李四的“罪状”贴满街；“不用心思不用脑，闭上眼睛跟着跑。别人说坏咱说坏，别人说好咱说好；最好调门儿高八度，挥拳跳脚喊口号”。
    在这次由学潮而动乱而反革命暴乱中，跟着起哄的也不少，好像脑袋长在别人肩膀上，人家说反什么，打什么，要什么，他也跟着喊反什么，打什么，要什么，压根儿未弄清事情的来龙去脉、内中隐秘，便鬼使神差般上街游行稀里糊涂跟着“声援”，有的终致不能自拔，挡军车、围军人，甩起了砖头、石头，陷入深渊！
    起哄的当然不能说都是坏人，其中不明真相的好人当是大多数。但带头发难的或起哄主角，情况、性质则不然。他们或为了达到不可告人的政治目的，或为了宣泄私愤和不满的情绪，或想给社会制造点惊恐与麻烦。有的人又要干坏事，又想藏在幕后，因时乘势借助众人以生事端，造谣、诬陷、作假、煽惑起哄；将随之起哄的人既当作伤人的暗箭，又当作护身的盾牌；既要达到捣乱的目的，又想捞一个“法不责众”溜之大吉的收场。这正反映了此类人心狠计拙、色厉内荏的窘态。随从起哄的，确有稀里糊涂凑热闹的傻角儿，似乎不跟着起哄叫闹就不合潮流赶时髦。闹闹哄哄间，就颠倒了是非，混淆了善恶，苍蝇就下了蛆，坏人就售了奸，掀起了风波。煽动并带头哄起的自然可恶，跟着起哄的也实在可悲！
    海内有起哄病，海外也以此贵恙，互为呼应。这次平息反革命暴乱后，国外某些反共媒体忍不住嗷嗷一哄起，别的不少媒体也不弄个明白就跟着瞎起哄，自觉不自觉地掀起了一阵反华小合唱。然而，事实是哄不倒的。随着事实真相大白，合唱者们搬石头砸了自己的脚。
    人贵沉着切实。贵独立思考，真知灼见。事实最有说服力。如果自己有想法，有意见和建议，可以通过正当途径，通过民主与法制的轨道来解决。既不可听风就是雨，更不可稀里糊涂受人驱遣，作阴谋家手中的人质、暗箭或护身的盾牌。
    “起哄病”害人害己，更误国。愿人们在反思中自己治治“起哄病”。倘能痊愈，那么，即令是这次吃了苦，日后不再发热，重蹈覆辙，也算是坏事变成了好事。
