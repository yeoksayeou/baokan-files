The People's Liberation Army Press has published "A History of China's Modern Anti-Aggression Wars," which is a vivid textbook for patriotic education.

Modern Chinese history is a history of humiliation. From the 1840s to the early 20th century, over nearly 80 years, imperialist powers, in order to seize economic interests and political privileges in China and partition the country, turning it into their colony, repeatedly launched armed invasions against China. Britain led the way, followed by France, the United States, Russia, Japan, Germany, and others, who successively instigated the First and Second Opium Wars, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and the Boxer Rebellion. These invaders spread war across China's coastal and border regions, even to the capital. They plundered property, burned and killed indiscriminately, and did whatever they pleased. Particularly during the Second Opium War, the Anglo-French Allied Forces burned down the Yuanmingyuan, which had been meticulously maintained for 150 years and was known as the "Palace of Oriental Art," creating an unprecedented national humiliation. They repeatedly forced the Chinese government to sign unequal treaties, ceding territory and paying indemnities, plundering the wealth that the Chinese people had accumulated with their blood and sweat, making the masters of this land into slaves to be butchered at will. The numerous historical facts listed in this book are hard to recall.

Modern Chinese history is also a history of struggle. Modern China has experienced countless hardships. However, the iron hooves of imperialism that trampled on Chinese soil also awakened the sleeping Chinese nation. The Chinese people, who did not want to be slaves, repeatedly fought to the death with the invaders with their own flesh and blood. Defeated many times, they fought back many times, repeatedly proving to the world that the Chinese people have an unconquerable spirit. From the First Opium War to the anti-aggression wars in Xinjiang, Taiwan, Northeast China, and Tibet, the people of all ethnic groups in our country fearlessly resisted and fought bravely, writing glorious chapters. Especially the broad masses of the Taiping Army, the Black Flag Army, and the Boxers, with the great cause of "When the country is in danger, every citizen has the responsibility to defend it," they rose up in arms to defend their homes and country, fully embodying the traditional qualities of the Chinese people. A history of China's modern anti-aggression wars is not just a record of failures, but a history of the unyielding struggle of the Chinese people, ultimately leading to the great achievement of the Chinese nation standing proudly among the nations of the world.

Modern Chinese history is also a history of outstanding figures. At the critical moment of the Chinese nation's survival, national heroes like Lin Zexu, anti-violence fighters like Deng Tingzhen, and blood-stained heroes like Guan Tianpei, Mongolian hero Yu Qian, defender of Dinghai Island Ge Yunfei, Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan, leader of the Small Sword Society Liu Lianchang, leader of the Black Flag Army Song Jingshi, patriot Liu Yongfu, Deng Shichang who vowed to perish with the warship, leader of the Taiwanese volunteer army Xu Xiang, and leader of the Boxers Zhang Decheng, and others stood out, demonstrating the extremely precious national spirit and patriotism of the Chinese people, becoming outstanding representatives of millions of national heroes. In addition, there were some Qing dynasty generals who had previously suppressed peasant uprisings but, at the critical moment of national crisis, joined forces to resist foreign aggression, such as Shi Rongchun, Feng Zicai, Zuo Baogui, Liu Jintao, Zuo Zongtang, and others. The book also objectively discusses each of them.

It must be admitted that China's modern anti-aggression wars, although they were just wars, were mostly defeated. The reasons are multifaceted, but the fundamental reason is the backwardness caused by the Qing dynasty's policy of closing the country and locking the doors, as well as the corruption and incompetence of the rulers, which led to disunity throughout the country, making it impossible to resist foreign invasions.

    进行爱国主义教育的生动教材
    ——《中国近代反侵略战争史》
    范传新
    解放军出版社出版的《中国近代反侵略战争史》，是一部进行爱国主义教育的生动教材。
    中国近代史是一部屈辱史。从十九世纪40年代至二十世纪初的近80年间，帝国主义列强，为夺取在华经济利益和政治特权，瓜分中国，把中国变成他们的殖民地，屡屡武装侵略中国。英国策动于前，法、美、俄、日、德等国追随于后，先后挑起了两次鸦片战争、中法战争、中日甲午战争和八国联军之役。这帮强盗将战火燃遍我国的海疆和边陲，直至畿辅地区。抢夺财物，涂炭先灵，无所不为。特别是第二次鸦片战争中，英法联军将清朝经营一百五十年，被称为东方艺术宫殿的圆明园付之一炬，铸成空前国耻。他们一次次用枪炮逼迫中国政府签订一个个丧权辱国的不平等条约，割地赔款，将中国人民长期用血汗积聚的财富掳掠殆尽，使这片国土的主人成为任其宰割的奴隶。本书所列有关大量史实，让人不堪回首。
    中国近代史是一部奋斗史。近代的中国历经磨难。但是，践踏了中国土地的帝国主义铁蹄，也唤醒了沉睡的中华民族。不愿做奴隶的中国人民，一次次用自己的血肉同侵略者进行殊死的搏斗。屡战屡败，屡败屡战，反复向世界证明，中国人民有一颗不可征服的心。从第一次鸦片战争起，直至新疆、台湾、东北和西藏等地的反侵略战争止，我国各族人民不畏强暴，英勇反抗，写下了壮烈的篇章。特别是广大太平军将士、黑旗军官兵、义和团民众，以“天下兴亡，匹夫有责”为大义，揭竿而起保家卫国的壮举，更体现了我国人民的传统品质。一部中国近代反侵略战争史，并不只是失败的记录，而是一部中国人民奋斗不息的历史，它最终引出了中华民族自立于世界民族之林的华章。
    中国近代史也是英杰辈出的历史。在中华民族续绝存亡之际，民族英雄林则徐、抗暴志士邓廷桢、血染虎门的关天培、蒙古族英雄裕谦、保卫定海的葛云飞、天王洪秀全、小刀会首领刘丽川、黑旗军领袖宋景诗、爱国将领刘永福、誓与战舰共存亡的邓世昌、台湾民军领袖徐骧、义和团首领张德成等等，挺身而出，表现了中国人极其可贵的民族气节和爱国热忱，成为千百万卫国英雄的杰出代表。此外还有一些曾镇压过农民起义，但在国家危亡关头，同御外侮的清军将领，如史荣椿、冯子才、左宝贵、刘锦棠、左宗棠等等，本书也实事求是地逐一论列。
    必须承认，中国近代的反侵略战争，虽然是正义之战，但大多毕竟是战败了。其原因是多方面的，但根本的原因，是清王朝闭关锁国政策造成的落后，以及统治者腐败昏庸，致使国家上下离心，一盘散沙，无法抵御外敌侵略。
