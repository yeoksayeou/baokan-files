The overheated U.S. economy has finally cooled down. Is this a necessary adjustment to achieve an economic "soft landing," or is it an ominous sign that the U.S. economy is entering a recession?

Recent economic indicators released by the U.S. have raised concerns among some that the U.S. economy is on the brink of a new recession. Greenspan announced that the focus of the Federal Reserve's policy will shift from combating inflation to avoiding a recession.

Recent statistics have made U.S. economic circles suddenly tense. In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. real gross national product, after adjusting for inflation, grew by only 1.7%, far below the 3.7% of the first quarter and also below the expected 2%. This is the slowest growth since the third quarter of 1986; the purchasing economic index in July fell to 46%, the lowest level since 1983. Experts believe that an index below 50% indicates that manufacturing is in a state of contraction, and so far, the index has been below 50% for three consecutive months; the comprehensive leading index in June, after falling 1.3% in May, fell another 0.1%. Generally speaking, a comprehensive leading index falling for three consecutive months is a signal that the economic boom is ending and a recession is imminent. The June figures not only mark the second consecutive month of decline but also the fourth decline this year; the new order index in July fell to 44.8%, the lowest point since November 1982; the production index also fell from 52.4% in June to 48.2% in July, the first decline in three years.

Obviously, growth is slowing. Many economists predict that such weak growth rates will put the U.S. economy in a dangerous situation. At that time, any unforeseen shock could lead to a recession. The White House has already expressed dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening policy and is now taking a more aggressive stance. Recently, U.S. Budget Director Richard Darman publicly expressed the government's tense mood in a speech. He urged the Federal Reserve not to worry about inflation anymore, "but to focus on avoiding a recession in the national economy."

In fact, the Federal Reserve's anxiety is no less than that of the White House. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan recently warned at a congressional hearing that the current situation in the U.S. is such that any event or policy mistake could trigger a new economic recession. He also announced that the Federal Reserve's primary goal will now shift from curbing inflation to preventing a recession.

However, is the situation really that serious?

An unusual phenomenon is that while the economic growth rate is slowing, the New York Stock Market, often referred to as the economic "weather vane," has surged; others say that an economic "soft landing" will help avoid a recession.

Although the second quarter's statistics cast a shadow over the future development of the U.S. economy, they did not stop the stock market from rising. In early May, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just over 2,200 points, but by late July, it had surpassed 2,600 points. On August 24, the index reached 2,734.64 points, surpassing the historical high of 2,722.42 points before the stock market crash in August 1987. In just three months, the stock market rose by nearly 500 points, a rare occurrence in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Since the stock market has always been the main source of funds for U.S. companies, the current stock market boom reflects, to some extent, investors' confidence in the future of the U.S. economy.

Many people still believe that the current slowdown in the U.S. economic growth rate is not a sign of recession but rather an indication that the U.S. economy can achieve a "soft landing." David Wise, an economist at the U.S. Data Service Company, said, "Economic growth will continue to slow, but as long as the slowdown does not lead to a recession, it is a soft landing, which is what we hope for."

In mid-1987, the U.S. economy, which had been growing for nearly five years, began to show signs of overheating. In March last year, the Federal Reserve began implementing a tightening plan. Throughout the year, the U.S. federal funds rate increased by more than 3 percentage points, and the basic discount rate also rose from 6.5% to 7%. Affected by this, major U.S. commercial banks also raised interest rates significantly, and after raising the prime rate four times last year, they raised it twice more at the beginning of this year.

However, using high interest rates to cool down an overheated economy comes with great risks. Because such a large increase in interest rates in one year will seriously affect the expansion of consumption and investment. Therefore, although the Federal Reserve's tightening plan was welcomed by the economic community, they were also concerned that the economy might fall into a recession after tightening.

The situation over the past year shows that although various growth indicators have significantly declined, the basic factors supporting the development of the U.S. economy, such as consumer spending, corporate investment, and exports, have not been damaged. In particular, the two major deficits that have long plagued the U.S. economy have shown significant improvement (the fiscal deficit in the first nine months of the 1989 fiscal year decreased by 11.6% compared to the previous year, and the trade deficit in the first half of the year, calculated on an annual basis, decreased by 8.4% compared to the same period last year). This obviously relieved the concerns of investors who feared that the U.S. economy would fall into a recession. A report recently published by the American Business Council, composed of 65 corporate leaders, can be said to represent the views of this group of people. They believe that the Federal Reserve's policy of gradually raising interest rates over the past year will help curb inflation, and the increase in magnitude has not been large enough to cause the economy to fall into a recession. This is the view of the more optimistic faction among economists.

The basic factors supporting U.S. economic growth are still at work, but the shadow of recession has not been eliminated. The U.S. economy may experience low growth in the coming period.

Many people in the U.S. economic community believe that although the U.S. economy is currently developing slowly, a recession is not likely to occur soon. The National Business Council has put forward three reasons: there is no major imbalance in the current U.S. economy; the Federal Reserve will not further raise interest rates; it is expected that the economies of other industrialized countries will continue to maintain strong growth, thereby promoting U.S. exports.

However, it should also be noted that the U.S. economy, which has been growing for 82 months, has entered the late stage of this economic cycle, and various forces hindering economic growth are beginning to emerge. By May of this year, corporate inventories had increased for seven consecutive months, indicating that domestic consumption demand is declining; the manufacturing industry, which is praised as an important pillar of the U.S. economy, is shrinking, which will further affect the U.S. industrial base; the inflation rate (second quarter) reached 5.2%, rising to the highest level in seven years, and will still limit the Federal Reserve's ability to ease credit. In addition, although the U.S. fiscal and trade "twin deficits" have been reduced, the amounts are still enormous, and this is also a hidden danger in the U.S. economy. Foreign media have commented that given the current situation of the U.S. economy, Greenspan would not be forced to adopt a "braking and accelerating" policy. Therefore, the Federal Reserve, in choosing between avoiding a recession and avoiding inflation, has a very narrow "policy path." Americans cannot place too much hope in Greenspan's promise to ease credit.

In summary, from the above factors, it can be seen that in the second half of this year and possibly for a longer period, if there are no sudden events (such as a sharp rise in oil prices), the U.S. economy will not fall into a recession, and its growth rate will hover at the current level.

### 美国经济：衰退乎？“软着陆”乎？

    美国经济：
    衰退乎？“软着陆”乎？
    孙毅
    “过热”的美国经济终于“降温”了。这是为实现经济“软着陆”作的“必要”调整呢，还是美国经济正在进入衰退的不祥之兆？
    美国最近公布的一系列经济指标使一些人担心美国经济濒临新的衰退。格林斯潘宣布：联邦储备委员会政策的重点将由对付通货膨胀转向避免衰退。
    最近公布的统计数字使美国经济界人士突然紧张起来。今年第二季度美国实际国民生产总值在扣除通货膨胀因素之后仅增长1.7％，不仅大大低于第一季度3.7％，而且也低于2％的预期数字。这是自1986年第三季度以来增长速度最慢的一个季度；7月份的采购经济指数下降到46％，为1983年以来的最低水平。专家认为，该指数低于50％即表示制造业处于收缩状态，而迄今为止该指数已连续3个月低于50％；6月份的先行指标综合指数继5月份下降1.3％之后又下降了0.1％。一般说来，先行指标综合指数连续3个月下降，是经济高涨阶段结束、衰退即将来临的一个信号。而6月份的数字则不仅是连续第二个月下降，也是今年以来的第4次下降；7月份新订单指数下降到44.8％，处于1982年11月以来的最低点；生产指数亦从6月份的52.4％下降到7月份的48.2％，为3年来的首次下降。
    显然，增长在放慢。不少经济学家预测，增长速度如此疲弱，将令美国经济陷入危险的境地。到时，任何无法预料的震荡都有可能带来衰退。白宫方面早已表示对联邦储备委员会实行的货币紧缩政策不满，现在更是摆出了一副咄咄逼人的态度。日前美国预算局长理查德·达曼在一次谈话中公开表达了政府的紧张心理。他敦促联储不要再担心出现通货膨胀，“要更注意务必避免使本国经济陷入衰退”。
    其实，联邦储备委员会的紧张心理丝毫不亚于白宫。联储主席格林斯潘最近在一次国会听证会上就向人们发出过警告：目前美国的形势是，某种事件或政策上的失误，都有可能触发一场新的经济衰退。他同时宣布，现在联储的首要目标将由遏制通货膨胀转向防止衰退。
    然而，势态果真这样严重吗？
    一个反常的现象，在经济增长速度放慢的同时，作为经济“晴雨表”的纽约股市却大幅度上升；另有人称，经济上的“软着陆”将有助于避免衰退。
    第二季度的统计数字尽管为美国经济今后的发展罩上了一层阴影，但却未能阻止股票行情的上升。5月初，道·琼斯30种工业股票平均指数还仅为2200多点，但到7月下旬便超过了2600点。8月24日，该指数竟达到2734.64点，超过股市暴跌前的1987年8月25日的2722.42点的历史最高纪录。在短短的3个月里，股市就上升了近500点，这在纽约股票交易所的历史上是罕见的。由于股票市场历来是美国公司筹措资金的主要来源，因此，此时股票市场的繁荣就从一个侧面反映了投资者对未来美国经济仍充满着信心。
    许多人仍认为，目前美国经济增长速度由强转弱，非但不是衰退的迹象，反而说明美国经济可以实现“软着陆”。美国数据服务公司的经济学家戴维·怀斯就说，经济增长将继续保持慢速，但是，只要放慢速度而不引起衰退就是软着陆，这正是我们所期望的。
    1987年年中，已持续增长近5年的美国经济开始出现过热的现象。去年3月，联储开始实施紧缩计划。一年中，美国的联邦基金利率提高了3个百分点以上，基本利率贴现率也由6.5％提高到7％。受其影响，美国各大商业银行也纷纷大幅度提高利率，继去年四次提高优惠利率后，今年初又两次提高了该项利率。
    但是用高利率来冷却过热的经济却要冒极大的风险。因为一年之内利率如此大的提高，会严重影响消费与投资的扩大。因此，尽管联邦储备委员会的紧缩计划赢得了经济界的欢迎，但他们也担心紧缩之后美国经济出现衰退。
    一年来的情况表明，尽管各项增长指标明显下降，但支撑美国经济发展的各项基本因素如消费支出、企业投资、出口等并没有受到破坏，特别是长期以来一直困扰美国经济的两大赤字有了明显的改善（1989年财政年度头9个月的财政赤字比上一年度减少11.6％，上半年美国贸易赤字按年率计算比去年同期下降8.4％），这显然使那些担心美国经济陷入衰退的投资者们松了一口气。由65家大公司的企业领导人组成的美国企业理事会最近公布的一份报告谈的观点可以说代表了这部分人的看法，他们认为，联邦储备委员会在过去一年中采取的逐步提高利率的政策将有助于遏制通货膨胀，而提升的幅度又未大到使经济陷入衰退的程度。显然，这是经济界人士中较为乐观的一派人的意见。
    支撑美国经济增长的基本因素仍在发挥作用，但衰退的阴影未消除，今后一段时间内的美国经济可能是低速增长。
    美国经济界许多人士认为，尽管目前美国经济发展迟缓，但衰退还不至于很快发生。全国企业理事会提出了3点理由：当前美国经济不存在重大失衡；联邦储备委员会不会进一步促升利率；预计其他工业发达国家的经济将继续保持强有力的增长，从而推动美国的出口。
    但是也应该看到，经济增长已持续82个月的美国经济，已进入此次经济周期的末期，阻碍经济增长的各种力量初见端倪。到今年5月份，企业存货已连续7个月增长，表明国内消费需求正在下降；被人誉为重振美国经济的重要支柱制造业萎缩，这将进一步影响美国的工业基础；通货膨胀率（第二季度）达5.2％，上升到7年来的最高水平，仍将限制联邦储备委员会放松银根的幅度。另外，美国财政、外贸“双赤字”虽有所减少，但数额仍然庞大，这也是美国经济中的隐患。外电已经评论，鉴于目前美国经济的情况，格林斯潘绝不愿被迫采取“刹车和加油的政策”，因此，联邦储备委员会在选择避免衰退和避免通货膨胀方面的时候，其“政策路子”很窄。美国人不可能对格林斯潘所作的放宽信贷的许诺寄予更多的希望。
    总之，从以上各种因素可以看出，今年下半年乃至更长一段时间内，若无突发性事件（如石油价格猛升等）发生，美国经济还不致于出现衰退，其增长速度将在目前的水平上徘徊。
