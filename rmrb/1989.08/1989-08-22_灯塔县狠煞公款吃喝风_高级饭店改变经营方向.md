Lintao County in Liaoning Province has taken stringent measures to crack down on the use of public funds for dining out, resulting in a significant decline in business for high-end restaurants in the county seat. Some of these establishments have had to change their business models.

Previously, some restaurants in the county had daily revenues exceeding 1,000 yuan, with most customers being public-funded diners who required receipts or signatures. Since these customers stopped coming, daily sales have dropped to just a few dozen yuan. Out of the 107 restaurants in Lintao County, 50 have had to close. Many restaurants that once specialized in high-end banquets and northern and southern cuisines now sell noodles, dumplings, sorghum rice, and tofu brain.

    灯塔县狠煞公款吃喝风  高级饭店改变经营方向
    新华社沈阳8月22日电  （记者夏阳、通讯员陈殿升）辽宁省灯塔县采取过硬措施狠煞用公款吃喝风后，县城里高级饭店生意萧条，有些不得不改变经营方向。
    这个县有的饭店过去每天营业额都在千元以上，顾客大都是要发票或签字的公费户；他们不上门以后，一天只卖几十元。灯塔县城107家饭店，已有50家停业。一些过去经营高级宴席、南北大菜的饭店，如今卖起了面条、馄饨、高梁米饭和豆腐脑。
