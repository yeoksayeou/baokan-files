    Industry Self-Governing Bodies Under Party Leadership:
    Further Pilot Programs for Guilds
    Aimed at Serving the Government, Society, and Enterprises

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 13th - At the closing of the National Guild Work Experience Exchange Conference yesterday, Rong Yiren emphasized that work in the industrial and commercial sectors must adhere to patriotism and socialist education, with everything focused on the interests of the state and the people.

    The conference began on August 8th. The conference showed that guilds, which played an active role in socialist construction and socialist transformation in the early days of the founding of the nation, are now regaining their vitality. Currently, 18 provinces and municipalities have established over 100 guilds. They are playing an active role in economic construction with their unique characteristics of being grassroots, regional, and cross-system.

    Guilds are industry self-governing bodies organized voluntarily by enterprises under the leadership of the Communist Party, serving the government, society, and enterprises. During the exploratory pilot phase, various levels of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have played a significant role. At this conference, industrial and commercial representatives from various regions exchanged experiences.

    The conference discussed how to further improve the pilot work of guilds in the future. The conference emphasized that the pilot work should take the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party as a guide, adhering to "one center, two basic points"; and should adhere to the principle of serving the government, society, and enterprises.

    Responsible comrades from relevant departments of 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as relevant ministries and commissions of the State Council, attended the conference.

    党领导下的行业自治团体
    同业公会将进一步试点
    宗旨是为政府社会和企业服务
    新华社北京8月13日电  在昨天闭幕的全国同业公会工作经验交流会上，荣毅仁强调，工商界工作要坚持爱国主义和社会主义教育，一切着眼于国家和人民的利益。
    会议于8月8日召开。会议显示了建国初期曾在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中发挥过积极作用的同业公会，正焕发出新的生气。目前，全国已有18个省市建立起100余家同业公会。他们以自己特有的民间性、地域性和跨系统性，在经济建设中起着积极作用。
    同业公会是在共产党领导下，企业自愿组织起来的为政府为社会为企业服务的行业自治团体。在探索试办过程中，全国工商联各级组织发挥了重要作用。这次会上，来自各地的工商界人士彼此交流了经验。
    会议研究了今后如何进一步做好同业公会试点工作。会议强调，试点工作要以中共十三届四中全会精神为指针，贯彻“一个中心、两个基本点”；要坚持为政府、为社会、为企业服务的宗旨。
    全国20个省、自治区、直辖市有关部门的负责同志及国务院有关部委出席了会议。
