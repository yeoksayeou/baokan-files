    The incident of a police officer beating a passenger has been handled
    On April 12th, your newspaper published a letter titled "It is unacceptable for a police officer to beat someone without cause" after which our division immediately dispatched personnel to form an investigation team to various locations, investigating 17 individuals involved. From the verified facts, it is clear that police officer Liu Yunshan's act of striking Jiang Qijun in the face was wrong and is not permitted by regulations. Regarding this, we have decided: first, to conduct education on clean governance and disciplinary rectification among police officers, learn from this lesson, and strictly manage behavior. Second, to send someone to formally apologize to Jiang Qijun. Third, to give Liu Yunshan an administrative warning, deduct his monthly bonus and post allowance, and transfer him out of his current unit.

    乘警打人的事已处理
    4月12日，你报登载了信访纪要《乘警无故打人太不该》后，我分处立即派人组成调查组赴各地，调查了17位当事人。从查证的情况看，乘警刘云山打蒋齐君耳光是错误的，是纪律所不容许的。对此，我们决定：一、进行为警清廉教育和纪律作风整顿，吸取教训，严格管理。二、派人专程向蒋齐君陪礼道歉。三、对刘云山给予行政警告处分，扣发月奖金、岗贴，调离班组。
