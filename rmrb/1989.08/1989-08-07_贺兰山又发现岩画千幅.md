Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, August 7th.

Ningxia's archaeological workers have recently discovered more than a thousand exquisite rock paintings in the Helan Mountains.

Following the confirmation of over three hundred rock paintings five years ago, the staff of the Ningxia Archaeological Institute have conducted systematic surveys from south to north in the Helan Mountains in recent years. Among the newly discovered rock paintings, some depict ancient battle scenes, while others reflect the sexual lives of people from that era. Additionally, there are rare depictions of plants, wheeled vehicles, and city walls in ancient rock paintings. Furthermore, a large number of inscriptions from different periods have been discovered.

Experts believe that the Helan Mountain rock paintings were all carved using metal tools, with the earliest carvings dating back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, and the latest around the time of the establishment of the Western Xia Dynasty.

    贺兰山又发现岩画千幅
    新华社银川八月七日电  （记者褚庆喜）宁夏考古工作者最近又发现一千多幅精美的贺兰山岩画。
    继五年前考证出三百多幅岩画以后，宁夏考古所的工作人员近年从南到北对贺兰山岩画进行了系统的考察，新发现的岩画有的描绘古代战争情景，有的反映当时人们两性生活。还有古代岩画中极为少见的植物、轮车、城墙等图案。此外，还发现了大量的，不同年代的题记。
    专家认为，贺兰山岩画都是用金属工具凿刻而成，刻制年代的上限大约在春秋战国时期，下限当在西夏立国前后。
