A farmer in Oklahoma said, "This is the brightest prospect in today's agriculture"—you might not guess that he was referring to the ostrich farming industry.

Ostriches are the largest birds currently living on Earth, originally from Africa. Adult ostriches are over 2 meters tall and can weigh up to 135 kilograms. Ostriches are fast runners, capable of speeds over 60 kilometers per hour. Male ostriches have primarily black feathers, with white, attractive long feathers on their wings and tail. Female ostriches are light brown, and their eggs each weigh about 1.3 kilograms. Ostriches have long lifespans and can live up to 70 years.

In 1975, an agricultural crisis in the Midwest state of Iowa caused many farmers to go bankrupt. They sold off their livestock to pay off debts. Some people had a bright idea and turned to ostrich farming, making a lot of money. A local farmer named Leroy Kaufman bought a few ostriches in 1987. After just 85 days, he paid off a $15,000 loan and made a net profit of $25,000. He earned $100,000 that year. He said that he had never made so much money just from growing grains and raising livestock. Currently, a pair of adult ostriches is worth $35,000 to $60,000, and a pair in peak egg-laying season can be priced as high as $75,000. A chick can be sold for $3,000 each. Even at these high prices, the market demand cannot be met.

Raising ostriches is simple and easy. All you need is a piece of land enclosed with wire fencing. Ostriches have varied diets and will eat almost anything. They are generally fed a synthetic feed of alfalfa and grains, with occasional additions of lettuce leaves or cabbage. However, chicks are very delicate and easily die, with the current hatching rate at only 60%. Scientific feeding methods are still being explored and summarized. According to some farmers, they mainly make money by artificially hatching chicks and selling them. It takes about three years for a chick to hatch and start laying eggs. After that, they lay eggs continuously for 40 years, averaging 35 to 40 eggs per year. During the peak egg-laying period, a female ostrich lays an egg every two days, so the profits are quite substantial.

Ostriches are truly valuable from head to toe. Their feathers can be processed into fashionable clothing, ceremonial decorations, and computer dusters. Their skin can be made into boots, wallets, and car seats. Eggshells can be used in jewelry crafting. Ostrich meat is a deep red color, looking like beef and tasting like pork, and is very popular in Europe. Due to the insufficient supply from Africa, some European businessmen are already considering importing ostrich meat from the United States. Reports indicate that ostrich meat has low fat and cholesterol content, only one-third of that in beef, so it has been listed as a "healthy meat for the 1990s" by some American marketers. Some even predict that the United States will soon see "ostrich meat hamburgers." However, currently, the number of adult ostriches raised in the midwestern and southern states of the United States is only about 6,000, which is not enough to supply the ostrich slaughtering or processing industry.

Although many farmers believe that the potential market demand for ostriches is large and plan to further expand the breeding quantity, some are not so optimistic. A poultry expert in Texas believes that the current ostrich craze is "speculative" and that once the supply of chicks exceeds demand, it will decline, warning people not to rush in and follow the trend.

    美国农家养鸵鸟生财
    本报记者　仓立德
    俄克拉何马州一位农民说，“这是当今农业最光明的图景”——你大概猜不到，他指的是鸵鸟养殖业。
    鸵鸟是地球现存最大鸟类，原产非洲。成年鸵鸟身高2米以上，体重可达135公斤。鸵鸟善跑，时速可达60多公里。雄鸟羽毛以黑色为主，双翅及尾部有白色漂亮的长羽；雌鸟则为浅棕色，下的蛋每个重约1.3公斤。鸵鸟高寿，可活70年。
    1975年，中西部艾奥瓦州的一场农业危机使许多农户破产，他们纷纷变卖牲畜来抵债。一些人灵机一动，转向鸵鸟养殖业，赚了大钱。一位叫勒罗伊·考夫曼的当地农民1987年买了几只，85天后即还清1.5万美元贷款，还净赚2.5万美元，当年共获利10万美元。他说，过去单靠种谷物、养牲畜从来未挣过这么多钱。目前一对成鸟价值3.5万至6万美元，正值产蛋旺期的一对标价高达7.5万美元，雏鸟每只可卖3000美元。即便价格如此高昂，仍不能满足市场需求。
    饲养鸵鸟简单易行，只要有一块用铁丝圈起来的地便可。鸵鸟食性杂，几乎什么都吃。一般喂以苜蓿加谷物的合成饲料，偶尔添些莴苣叶或元白菜。但幼雏极娇嫩，很易夭折，目前孵活率仅为60％。科学的喂养经验还在不断摸索和总结中。据一些农民介绍，现在他们主要靠人工孵化幼鸟出售赚钱。一只幼雏从破壳而出到开始产蛋大约需时3年。此后连续产蛋40年，平均每年为35至40个，进入产蛋旺期的雌鸟每两天便产蛋1个，因此利润相当可观。
    鸵鸟可谓浑身是宝。其羽毛可加工成新潮服装、庆典装饰品及电脑除尘掸等；皮可制成靴子、钱包、轿车座；蛋壳可用于珠宝工艺品。鸵鸟肉颜色殷红，看起来像牛肉，吃起来似猪肉，在欧洲很受欢迎。由于从非洲来的货源供不应求，有的欧洲商人已有意从美国进口鸵鸟肉。据报道，鸵鸟肉的脂肪及胆固醇含量很低，只及牛肉的1／3，因此已被一些美国推销商列为“90年代的健康肉类”，有人甚至预言美国不久便会出现“鸵鸟肉汉堡包”。但目前美国中西部、南部几个州饲养的成鸵鸟只有6000只左右，数量太少，还不足以供应鸵鸟屠宰业或加工业。
    尽管不少农民认为鸵鸟的潜在市场需求量很大，并计划进一步扩大饲养量，但是也有人不那么乐观。得克萨斯州一位家禽专家认为，眼下的鸵鸟热具有“投机性”，一旦雏鸟供过于求便会走下坡路，因此警告人们不要蜂拥而上赶浪潮。
