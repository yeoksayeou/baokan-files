Novel creation in 1987 was still quite vibrant, but by 1988 it had sharply declined. At that time, the publishing industry was flooded with low-level, trivial books and magazines, and this frenzied and aggressive trend did not just affect the literary world. That year was dubbed by critics as a "small year." However, a "small year" is no obstacle; literary creation did not disappear, but instead continued to grow amidst the thorns and brambles, and there were even good works. Saying they are good is not an overstatement compared to previous years. Naturally, in terms of quantity, it did not match previous years. Now, let's observe some of the short and medium-length novels from these two years, and there will surely be a unique charm to be found.

Literature in these two years, needless to say, still maintained a diverse structure, and this will not be discussed here. However, what is noteworthy is that among the many works, the bright light of real life kept flashing, whether it was about today or past years. A call for an unforgettable pursuit of life kept striking the heart, with feelings of resentment, tears, joy, and excitement coming like a sudden storm. It seems that expressing reality and depicting reality are important themes in literature. If the brilliance of art does not approach reality, it cannot stir up people's most sincere emotions; if art appreciation is a kind of tranquil aesthetic experience, then if it is infused with vivid real-life flesh and blood, what emerges will be a different kind of heart-stirring aesthetic sentiment.

I believe that this aesthetic sentiment is a characteristic of contemporary literature. It inspires people's pursuit of life, and the artistic power of literature is infused with a pursuit of thought, making literature and people's spiritual needs converge, and truly entering people's spiritual realm. After reading the medium-length novel "Going Away with Hesitation" (by Liu Qi), I was deeply moved by the protagonist's pursuit. Although this novel still has its shortcomings, this autobiographical novel by a disabled soldier, in describing his own state of losing limbs and sight, his persistent pursuit of life is indeed heart-stirring. This pursuit is extraordinary, it is a pursuit of the highest realm of life in the state of despair of life's continuation. In the protagonist Xiaoliang, a rare and moving light has appeared in the literary creation of these years. However, this is reality, an undeniable reality of life. This literary pursuit can also be seen in other works. There are many topics in reality that can be used for writing, but they insist on excavating this kind of life sentiment that seems to have been forgotten for many years. Now the authors are expanding and showcasing it, which can be said to be a stream of spring water in the novels of these two years. To express this sentiment, they often use the past or the method of borrowing objects to express emotions. In "The Difference Between Winter and Summer" (by Miao Changshui), the story of the porter Li Shan revives some of the side events of the Menglianggu Battle, which were extremely ordinary during the war, but now read, they bring a solemn and extraordinary feeling, because Li Shan's pursuit of fearlessness has an everlasting noble value. Another medium-length novel, "White Horse" (by Wang Xingquan), almost entirely writes about the story of the intelligent horse "Feifei," but the main theme of the novel is clearly to showcase the heroic deeds of the people's cavalry during the Anti-Japanese War. Although these two novels talk about past events, the fusion of artistic pursuit and spiritual pursuit constitutes the novelty of the works.

This kind of aesthetic sentiment that arouses the pursuit of life is most vividly expressed in the short story "Sweet Iron, Fishy Iron" (by Yang Yongming). Who has tasted the taste of iron being sweet or fishy? The female protagonist in the novel can evoke such unusual taste imagination during labor. This imagination is akin to a poetic narrative, incorporating labor and life into the realm of poetry. Is this not a pursuit? She pursues the beauty of life, the beauty of labor, and even the beauty of steel. Unusual deep emotions nurture a vast and boundless world of life, giving rise to feelings of attachment, intoxication, and uncontrollable passion. The entry of poetry and prose into the novel is not entirely an absorption of artistic form, but an acquisition and penetration of the artistic thinking, imagination, and emotions of poetry and prose. A novel that is completely written in the format of prose is also very interesting, such as "Horse Neighing, Autumn Lament" (by Xie Youyin). This novel can almost be read as prose. Here, the details of selecting horses, driving, and galloping are described in a magical and unrestrained manner, with unrestrained and swift movements, like a dream, like a painting, like being drunk, like flying. The artistic structure of the novel is refined in this way, bringing a dazzling new world of creation to literature. Here, it seems that the pursuit of art and the pursuit of life have already fused into a kind of divine thought.

Of course, the changes in the countryside in these two years cannot be ignored. Writing about the countryside, one cannot help but feel a mixture of joy and sorrow, which is reflected in many works. "Hulu Valley Past and Present" (by Ma Fen) brings a hint of joyful vitality, which is naturally the scenery brought by reform and opening up. The joy in "Six Poems at the Year's End" (by A Cheng) is even greater, as the author vividly writes about the family of Old Three's father by the Songhua River, from the time his grandfather fled from the interior to the present prosperity. However, writers do not necessarily pour their ink on the countryside, which makes the depiction of the countryside's scenery have a multi-angle perspective. For example, the short story "Calling a Meeting" (by Bo Yu) writes about a village in the mountains, capturing the essence of the village's atmosphere through the demeanor of the village head and the slow and orderly mindset of the attendees. Another work that writes about a different kind of simplicity is an old man with a limp giving a cow to a young generation who are not relatives, which is the story told in "Cow Trader's Mountain Road" (by Yan Ning). In contrast, "Small Clinic" (by Zhou Daxin) writes about the character of Cen Ziqi, who has both a self-sacrificing spirit and a vulgar tendency to accumulate wealth, and the contrast between the two is revealed to the world. Praise and criticism are left to the heart of the reader, but what is given to people is inevitably a sense of confusion.

However, the sense of crisis flowing in the countryside is not just this much. "Tapo" is a heavyweight work. The suffering youth, in order to study, first needs to consider survival, and the persistent heart of studying is clearly an extremely pure wish. What is there to say? But Lian gave away her engagement ring due to poverty and was forced to marry a stranger, and her heart-wrenching farewell with her beloved left people with only a vast emptiness, and the feeling given to people can only be a hope for the early arrival of a better life. The protagonist in the medium-length novel "Tianqiao" caused his mother's sudden death due to his own wrongful case, and twenty-two years later he went to find her remains, this sad story, although it writes about the unpredictability of life, but it actually writes about the fate of the innocent sufferers in the absence of legal system. This kind of insoluble sorrowful work has been appearing almost every year, which is simply because the past years are unforgettable, and it seems that the sufferers' cry of pain still contains the meaning of hoping that the history of blood and tears will not be repeated, "knowing that the future can be pursued" is undoubtedly a kind of awakening consciousness, and it has the positive pursuit of life within it. People's yearning often comes at the cost of pain, and the deeper the pain, the more firm the yearning becomes. Literature constantly takes this kind of insoluble sorrow as a topic, which is precisely intended to seek a solid pursuit of life.

The mood of joy and sorrow permeates the works most evenly, and that is the current novels about urban life. "Scenery" (by Fang Fang) and "Troubles of Life" (by Chi Li) are well-known medium-length novels about the base life of the city, whether it is about the life of the poor in the sheds of Hankou, Henan, or the activities of a workshop director living in a small room with his family; whether it is about their life troubles, the red tape at work, the teasing of love, the cramped living conditions, they are actually all rushing around their own wishes to be realized quickly. This urgent demand to improve the current situation is a common mindset in urban life, and this mindset is kind and beautiful, but it is also bitter and melancholic. However, they are indeed making various struggles and pursuits, which constitutes a chaotic scene of urban social life. Naturally, there are also things in this life pursuit that are crushed by reality, such as Wang Bailin in "Pretentious" (by Lu Wenfu), who is entangled by the burden of his own job status and the outdated civilized demeanor, and finally creates a nearly unbearable tragedy. However, people will inevitably sympathize with him, Wang Bailin is not a laggard of the times, his pretentiousness shines with the pure light of humanity. In the novels seen, the other two works about intellectuals are also interesting in their own way. "Chasing the Moon Tower" (by Ye Zhaoyan) writes about the scene of the Ding family in Nanjing after the fall of 1937. The rigid and outdated way of life in the feudal family is both strange and terrifying to today's readers, but the novel's ink is about the old Mr. Ding, who did not become a traitor and therefore vowed not to go downstairs. The precious spirit of old intellectuals adds a touch of light to the novel. While "Horse Carriage" (by Chen Shixu) fully writes about the plight of middle-aged intellectuals today in seeking job titles for survival, whether the job title evaluation is a blessing or a curse, readers can easily get the news from it. What is worth paying attention to is the state written in "Reluctant to Divorce" (by Chen Rong), that kind of "making do" living state both makes people sympathetic and makes people disgusted. The binding force of ethics makes Liu Shuhuai unable to make do, but the coldness of his feelings with his wife inevitably makes him lose interest. This is a hidden family conflict that no one can escape, but the novel finally reveals a piece of information here, with the progress of social life and the increase of modern consciousness, the traditional marriage model that makes people uncomfortable will eventually appear some kind of disintegration, because the constituent of marriage and family relationship is people, and the emotional connection between people is ultimately not forced. The author's exploration of life, rather than saying that he wrote a life story, it is better to say that he sketched a certain breakthrough of the original ethical concept and showed a new pursuit.

Literature inevitably writes about people and events in society. Every year, novels emerge in large numbers, all of which cannot escape writing about these things, but if they continue to write about stories and old accounts that people are tired of, novels will decline, and no one will pay attention to them until their life ends. Only literature with vitality constantly renews itself in life that is always new and does not rot, crossing the passage of time and striding forward. Its vitality and intrinsic value lie in the unceasing pursuit of life; the freshness of the story and the freshness of the characters are indeed important, but if it cannot give people new conscience, new enlightenment, and the power to pursue life, it is still just a facade in literature. As for the medium and short-length novels of these two years, it is not appropriate to give them too high an evaluation, but the characteristics mentioned above in many chapters should not be ignored.

### 执著的人生追求——1987、1988年若干中短篇小说漫评

    执著的人生追求
    ——1987、1988年若干中短篇小说漫评
    洁泯
    1987年的小说创作还颇见景气，到了1988年就骤然滑坡，是时出版界低级无聊的书刊充斥市场，这浮躁凌厉之风的肆虐所及不独是文学界，这一年便是批评家称之为“小年”的时节。但“小年”无妨，文学创作并未因此绝迹，倒是在荆棘榛莽中生长依旧，而且有好作品，说它好，是不逊于往年。自然，就数量说，就不及以往了。现在就这两年中的若干中短篇小说作一观察，当别有一番风韵可寻。
    这两年中的文学，不消说依然是一种多元的格局，对此这里且不遑评说。可注意的是在众多的作品中，那醒目的现实生活的光芒却在不断闪现，不管它写的是今天或者是以往的年代，一种使人难忘的人生追求的呼唤，不息地锤击着人心，恼恨、挥泪、欢喜与昂奋之情如风雨之骤至。看来抒写现实和表现现实总是文学的重要课题，艺术的光辉倘不贴近现实，便不能激起人们最真诚的感情；如果说艺术的观赏是一种沉静的审美感受，那末，倘注以生动的现实血肉，出现的将是别一种激荡心扉的审美情思了。
    我以为，感受到的这一审美情思是当前文学中的一个特色，它激发着人的人生要求，文学的艺术力溶于思想追求中，使得文学与人们的心灵需求凝结在一起，也使得文学真正的进入到了人们的精神领域。我读了中篇小说《去意徊徨》（刘琦作）之后，便为作品中的追求力所震动，尽管这小说还存在着不足之处，但是这位伤残军人的自传体小说，在抒写自身失去了手足并失明的状态下，他的追求人生的执著的情感，实在是十分撼动人心的。这追求非比寻常，是处于生命的延续在绝望状态中也是人生的至高境界中的追求，在主人公小亮身上，闪现了的是这几年文学创作中罕见的动人光芒。然而这是现实的，是不容置疑的现实生活中的魅人的一角。这一文学寻求在别的作品中同样可以看出来，现实中可资谋篇的题材并不少，可是他们偏偏去发掘这种多年以来似乎已经陌生了的生活情思，如今作者给以铺衍张扬，可说是这两年小说中旋流着的一注春水。为表达这情思，他们常常借助于往事的陈迹，或者用托物以寄情的手法。《冬天与夏天的区别》（苗长水作）中写的民夫李山，就再现着当年孟良崮战役的侧面中这个平凡的农民所做过的一些事，在战争时期那些事是极平凡的，而如今读来却迎面扑来一种肃然的不平凡的感受，因为李山不畏艰险所追求的，有着至今不衰的崇高价值。另一个中篇《白马》（王星泉作），全篇写的几乎是通达人意的白马“飞飞”的事迹，但小说的主线，分明是托出了当年抗日战争中人民骑兵的英雄业绩。那两篇小说说的尽管是往事，但艺术追求和心灵追求的融合，却构成了作品的新意。
    这种唤起人生追求的审美情思，在短篇小说《甜的铁，腥的铁》（杨咏鸣作）中焕发得最为淋漓酣畅了。谁尝过铁的滋味是甜的，是腥的？小说女主人公却能在劳动中勾起那种异样的味觉想象，这想象无异是一种诗话，将劳动与生活纳入到诗的境界去，这不是追求吗？她追求的是人生的美，劳动的美，连同钢铁的美，异样的深情蕴育着一个博大而无比宽阔的人生世界，一种留恋、陶醉、狂狷不禁之情由此而起。诗与散文的进入小说，不完全是艺术形式的吸取，而是对诗与散文的艺术思维、想象、情感的获得和渗透。完全纳入散文抒写格局为文体的小说也是很有趣的，像《马嘶．秋诉》（谢友鄞作）这样的小说，几乎可以当作散文读。这里把选马、驾驭、奔驰这些细节描摹得神奇而洒脱，酣练奔逸，风驰电掣，读之如梦，如画，如醉，如飞。小说的艺术结构锤炼如此，给文学带来着一个令人目眩的创新天地。在这里，似乎可以看作艺术的追求和生活的追求已融于一种神思之中了。
    对这两年的小说，自然不能忽视农村的变化。写农村的情意，不免要感到一种忧喜参半之情，在多篇作品中彼起此落的映现着。《葫芦沟今昔》（马烽作）便升起了一缕欣然的生意，这自然是改革开放带来的景色。《年关六赋》（阿成作）的喜色更甚，作者极有兴味的写了松花江畔老三父亲一家从爷爷自关内逃荒到如今发家的兴盛史。但是作家写农村，似乎并不都将笔墨泼泻于此，这就使得描绘农村的风貌有了多方位的视角，例如短篇《喊会》（柏原作）写的虽只是支书召集开会一节，但他的神情，与会者慢斯条理的心态，将山区一个小村的风情写得颇堪咀嚼。写另一种淳朴之风的是一位瘸腿老汉赠牛给非亲非故的年轻一代，这便是《牛贩子山道》（雁宁作）所陈述的世代不衰的世道古意。与此迥异的是《小诊所》（周大新作），写的并非是诊所种种，只是将岑子其人的既有舍己精神，又溺于敛财的庸俗气的反差品格公之于世，对其人的褒贬自在人心，但投给人们的不免是一团困惑。
    然而流动于农村的忧患意识何止这一点？《塔铺》是一篇极有分量的力作，苦难的青年在求学中还先需顾及求生，而求学的孜孜之心分明是一种极纯真的愿望，有什么可说的呢？但爱莲给于因贫困无援而被迫典质并嫁给了一个陌生者，她与心上人泪别的断肠处，留给人们的只是一片苍茫，给人的感应只能是希求脱贫的佳境早日降临。中篇《天桥》中的主人公因本人的错案引起母亲的猝死，二十二年后他去寻尸起骨，这一段凄楚情，写的虽是人生之难测，但其实写了法制之不存的状况下的无辜受难者的命运。这类忧患难解的作品几乎连年不断的有，无非是因为过去的年代使人难忘，而看来受难者的诉说痛苦，还包含着希望那血泪的历史不再重演的意思在内，“知来者之可追”，无疑是一种觉醒意识，具有积极的人生追求的内涵在。人之向往，常以痛苦为代价，唯其痛苦弥深，就使得这一向往也弥坚，文学不断地以此种难解的忧患为题，恰是为着寻求坚实的人生追求而立意的。
    忧喜参半的意绪渗透于作品中最具均匀状态的，无过于当前写城市生活的小说了。《风景》（方方作）、《烦恼人生》（池莉作）是人们所熟知的写城市基层生活的中篇，内中不论是写汉口河南棚子贫民生活，还是一家子蜗居于一间小屋里的车间主任的活动方式；不论是写他们生活的烦恼，工作中的扯皮，爱情的撩拨，居住的局促，他们奔忙着的其实都围绕着自身心目中的愿望快快实现。这种迫切的要求改善现状的心态，是市民生活中普遍的心态，这心态是善良的和美好的，也是苦涩的，忧郁的，然而他们确实在作各种拚搏和追求，这就组成了都市社会生活熙熙攘攘的一幅无序的景象。自然，这一生活追求中也有为现实矛盾所压碎了的事情，例如《清高》（陆文夫作）中的汪百龄，他正为自身的职业地位带来的率累以及过时了的文明风度所摆布，终于弄出了一场几乎难堪的悲剧，不过人们对他必然寄与着同情，汪百龄不是时代的落伍者，他的清高闪着人间纯净的亮色。看到的小说中，另两篇写知识分子的都各有亲趣。《追月楼》（叶兆言作）写1937年南京沦陷后丁家的情景。那封建家庭中古板而陈旧的生活方式，是如今读者看来是既纳罕又可怕的，然而小说的笔墨是在写那个不作汉奸因此誓不下楼的丁老先生，旧知识分子中一点可贵的气节给小说抹上了一色光泽。而《马车》（陈世旭作）则是写尽了今天中年知识分子谋职称以求生存的困窘状态，那评职称到底是福是苦，读者不难从中获知消息。值得重视的倒是《懒得离婚》（谌容作）中所写的那种情态，那种“凑和过”的生活状态既使人同情又使人厌弃，伦理的约束性使这位刘述怀不能不凑和过下去，而与妻子感情的冷漠又难免使他生趣索然。这是一个隐藏着的谁也无法去解脱的家庭矛盾，然而小说在这里终于揭示了一点信息，随着社会生活的进展，现代意识的增长，使人难堪的传统的婚姻模式将迟早会出现某种解体，因为构成婚姻和家庭关系的是人，而人与人的感情连结终究是不可勉强的。作者的生活探索，与其说是写了一则生活故事，无宁说是对固有的伦理观念勾划了某种突破和显示了新的追求。
    文学总不免写着社会的人和事，每年的小说层出不穷，都脱不了去写这些，但照旧的写着听厌了的故事和陈年老账，小说就会衰落下去，无人理睬以至终结其生命。而唯有有生命力的文学总在常新和不腐的生活中跨越着时间的流逝而阔步行进，它的生命力和内在价值端在于不息地追求人生；故事的新鲜，人物的新鲜固然很重要，但倘若不能给人们以新的良知，新的感悟，给以追求人生的力量，那仍不过是文学中的花架子。至于这两年中的中短篇小说，作过高的评价自然是不适宜的，但是其中不少篇章具有的前述特色，却不可忽视。
