In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, with the support of the state, Anhui Province has, despite its extremely weak economic foundation, constructed hundreds of key industrial and agricultural production projects. These projects have formed several important bases for energy, raw materials, and agricultural products, supplying the nation with large quantities of agricultural products, energy, and raw materials. According to incomplete statistics, over the past 40 years, the province has shipped out 21.1646 million tons of grain, 200 million tons of raw coal, 1.388 million tons of steel, and 950,000 tons of crude copper to other provinces. This has significantly supported national construction and promoted the economic development of the province.

Anhui Province is rich in resources. During the "First Five-Year Plan" to the "Fifth Five-Year Plan," the state invested in the construction of hundreds of key projects for resource development in Anhui. In the Huaihai region, 22 pairs of mines were built, and currently, the annual production of raw coal in Huaihai reaches over 20 million tons, making it the most important coal base in East China. In Ma'anshan, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, one of the ten major steel bases in the country, was established with a designed annual capacity of 2 million tons of steel, 2 million tons of iron, and 1.7 million tons of steel products. In Tongling, the Tongling Non-Ferrous Metals Company, one of the six major copper-producing bases in the country, was built with an annual production capacity of 800,000 tons of crude copper. The state's key construction project, Anqing Petrochemical Complex, has become the largest chemical enterprise in the province and one of the 13 major petrochemical plants in the country, with a crude oil processing capacity of 2.5 million tons. In agricultural infrastructure construction, the state invested more than 2 billion yuan to focus on the improvement of the Huai River, successively building the Foziling, Xianghongdian, Mozitan, and Meishan four major reservoirs and the Dangshihang irrigation project in the Huai River basin, improving the production conditions of the "Anhui West Granary."

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, various levels of government further strengthened the construction of Anhui's basic industries and infrastructure in energy, transportation, and raw materials. While developing coal production in the Huaihai mining area, the Huainan Pingzhuang Power Plant with a capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts and the Huainan Luohe Power Plant with a capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts were built and are under construction. In terms of transportation construction, the Luofu, Shangfu, Xuanhang, Huainan double-track, and Wanjian railways were built, and the internationally advanced Hefei Airport was completed. In the building materials industry, the Ningguo Cement Plant with a designed capacity of 1.5 million tons was built.

The construction and operation of key projects have enabled Anhui Province to form a national economic system with a relatively coordinated ratio of agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, accelerating the pace of economic development in the province. From 1978 to 1988, this period was the fastest and most dynamic in the province's economic development since the founding of the nation, and the province's main economic indicators have moved up in national rankings. The total industrial and agricultural output value rose from the 15th position in 1978 to the 13th position.

    皖重点建设项目发挥重大效益
    形成一批生产基地，支援了全国，带动了地方经济
    本报讯　建国40年来，在国家的支持下，安徽省在极为薄弱的经济基础上，兴建了数百项大中型工农业生产骨干项目，形成了一批在国内具有重要地位的能源、原材料工业及农副产品生产基地，向国家提供了大量的农副产品、能源和原材料。据不完全统计，40年来，全省调出省外的粮食2116.46万吨，原煤2亿吨、钢材1388万吨、粗铜95万吨，有力地支持了国家建设并带动了本省的经济发展。
    安徽省资源极其丰富，“一五”至“五五”计划期间，国家在安徽省投资兴建了数百个资源开发的重点建设项目。在两淮地区投资兴建了22对矿井，目前两淮原煤年产量达到2000多万吨，成为华东最重要的煤炭基地。在马鞍山建立了全国十大钢铁基地之一的马鞍山钢铁公司，年设计能力钢200万吨、铁200万吨、钢材170万吨。在铜陵兴建了全国六大产铜基地之一的铜陵有色金属公司，年产粗铜能力达8万吨。国家重点建设项目安庆石化总厂已成为全省最大的化工企业，也是全国13个大型石油化工厂之一，原油加工能力达250万吨。在农业基础建设方面，国家投资20多亿元，重点加强了淮河的整治，先后在淮河流域山区修建了佛子岭、响洪甸、磨子潭、梅山四大水库和淠史杭灌溉工程，改善了“皖西粮仓”的生产条件。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，各级政府进一步加强了安徽能源、交通、原材料等基础工业和基础设施的建设。在两淮矿区发展煤炭生产的同时，兴建和正在兴建装机容量为240万千瓦的淮南平圩电厂和120万千瓦的淮南洛河电厂；在交通建设方面，兴建了漯阜、商阜、宣杭、淮南复线、皖赣等铁路线，建成了具有国际水平的合肥航空港。在建材工业方面，建成了设计能力为150万吨的宁国水泥厂。
    重点工程的建设及投产，使安徽省形成了农轻重比例较为协调的国民经济体系，加快了全省经济发展的步伐。1978年到1988年，是建国以来经济发展速度最快、经济活力最强的时期，并使全省主要经济指标在全国的位次有所推前，工农业总产值由1978年的第15位上升到第13位。
