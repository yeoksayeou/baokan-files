People's Daily, Zhengzhou, August 16th - Reporter Li Erliang reports: The criticism by this newspaper regarding the nearly 900,000 yuan spent on public banquets in Henan's Nanle County in one year (see the fourth page of this newspaper on July 17th) has become a breakthrough for Nanle County's efforts in promoting clean governance.

The county committee and county government have formulated measures to curb extravagant banquets. The regulations stipulate: for each violation, the main leaders of the unit, leaders in charge of financial work, the individuals involved, and the accountants who approve the reimbursement will each be fined 50 yuan, and the incident will be publicly criticized throughout the county. For two violations, the individuals will be removed from their posts immediately, and disciplinary actions will be taken based on the severity of the offense. In addition to the mandatory implementation of "two public disclosures and one supervision" for entertaining guests, each department and unit must post the details monthly. The audit department will conduct regular and irregular inspections and report the findings to the relevant departments in a timely manner. Since the newspaper criticism a month ago, extravagant banquets in various hotels and guesthouses in Nanle County have basically disappeared.

People's Daily, Changsha - Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: A tax evaluation committee from Hunan Province, which was known for accepting banquets and gifts and wasting public funds (see the fourth page of this newspaper on July 15th), has recently been investigated and punished. Yang Baoqiu, the director of the Hunan Provincial Taxation Bureau's mid-level professional title evaluation committee, deputy director, and member of the party group, has been removed from his post and had his salary reduced by one level. Li Li, an evaluation committee member and deputy director, and Zhang Shaan, deputy director of the personnel department and head of the professional title reform office, have received administrative demerits, serious party warnings, and administrative demerits, respectively.

The Hunan Provincial Supervision Bureau has ordered Yang, Li, and Zhang to return all received gifts by the end of June. The bureau has also ordered all members of the provincial taxation bureau who participated in this evaluation to return all received gifts and evaluation allowances. The tax bureaus in various cities and prefectures have submitted written self-examinations.

    南乐接受报纸批评狠刹吃喝风  湖南一评审组吃请受礼被查处
    本报郑州8月16日电　记者李而亮报道：本报对河南南乐县一年公费吃喝近90万元一事的批评（见本报7月17日第四版），成为南乐县推进廉政建设的突破口。
    县委、县政府制订的刹吃喝风措施规定：发现违反一次，对单位主要领导人、分管财务工作的领导人、当事人和予以报销的会计各罚款50元，通报全县批评。发现违反两次，就地免职，视其情节轻重给予党纪政纪处分。各部门、单位接待客人情况除了必须实行“两公开一监督”，月月上墙张贴外，审计部门每月定期和不定时检查，随时向有关部门通报。报纸批评一月来，南乐县各招待所、宾馆里公费吃喝基本匿迹。
