The land management work in Banhu Township, Funing County, Jiangsu Province, is well-known within the province. The following are a few vignettes of the township's land management personnel enforcing the law and protecting the land.

The Unyielding Kong Zhaoyin

In January 1987, shortly after taking on the role of deputy township head responsible for land management, Kong Zhaoyin faced a difficult situation: a resident of Banhu Village's 6th Group, surnamed Zhu, had illegally occupied residential land to build four rooms without authorization. Kong Zhaoyin led land management staff and legal assistants to talk to Zhu, demanding that he demolish the structures within a set timeframe, but to no avail. Kong then organized a team to forcibly demolish the buildings. However, just eight days later, Zhu secretly built more rooms overnight.

Neighbors from nearby villages were watching to see how Kong Zhaoyin would handle this stubborn case. To everyone's surprise, Kong was even more resolute. He filed a lawsuit against Zhu in the county court. The legal battle had begun. Eventually, the court sent officials to forcibly demolish Zhu's and seven other households' 18 illegal buildings. Last October, during a cleanup of non-agricultural land, Kong organized eight teams. In just 15 days, they collected 43,000 yuan in land compensation fees, demolished 12 illegal structures, 48 small kilns, and reclaimed 228 mu of arable land.

"The Iron-Mouthed" Zhou Xuefeng

In 1986, Zhou Xuefeng took on the role of land management officer. Once, while handling an illegal construction case in Xicui Village, he found that the homeowner was completely unaware of the Land Management Law. This incident made Zhou feel guilty, realizing that to make the people cherish the land, they must know the law, understand the law, and abide by the law. He had 1,300 copies of the Land Management Law printed and distributed to each household. He also used the village's wired broadcast system to lecture on land laws to the villagers every first morning of the month.

He frequently visited villages and households to do his work. In March of this year, he learned that a villager in Beidang Village had built a house without approval. He went to the villager's home to persuade them, but his first and second visits were unsuccessful. However, he did not give up. On his third visit, he spent four whole hours persuading the homeowner, who finally conceded, saying, "I admit defeat to your 'iron mouth.' I'll demolish the house tomorrow."

    严格执法的“土地爷”
    姜兆玖　顾文明　孙永军
    江苏阜宁县板湖乡的土地管理工作在省内小有名气。下面记述的是该乡土地管理人员执法护地的几个小片断。
    铁面无私的孔兆银
    1987年元月份，刚负责土地管理工作的副乡长孔兆银就迎来棘手的事：板湖村6组村民朱某强占宅基地违法违章建房4间，孔兆银带领土地管理员、司法助理员找其谈话，限期拆除，毫无效果。他就组织人员强行拆除，可事隔8天，朱某又连夜突击建房。
    远近乡邻，都看着孔兆银，看他怎么对付这颗硬“钉子”。没想到，孔兆银更硬，他依法向县法院起诉。与朱某打起官司来了。最后，法院来人依法强行拆除朱某和其他7户18间的违法违章建房。去年10月，全乡清理非农业用地，他组织8个小分队，仅用15天时间就补征土地补偿费4.3万元，拆除违章建筑12处，小土窑48座，退还耕地228亩。
    “铁嘴”周学凤
    1986年，周学凤就担任土地管理员职务，一次，他到西崔村处理一户违章建房，房主对《土地管理法》一概不知，这事使周学凤深感内疚，他认识到，要使群众珍惜土地就必须使群众知法、懂法、守法。他便把《土地管理法》翻印1300多份发放到各户，还通过有线广播，在每个月第一天的早晨向村里群众宣讲有关土地法。
    他还经常走村串户做工作。今年3月，他了解到北荡村有一村民未经批准私自建房，就登门做说服工作，一次、二次都未做通，但他没有灰心。第三次他又登门劝说，整整4个小时，这户的户主终于心服口服地说：“我算服了你这张‘铁嘴’，明天就拆房子。”
