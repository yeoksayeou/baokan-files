    Over 200 Million Mu of Forest Land Occupied, 50 Million Mu of Forests Destroyed; Forestry Department Urges Stopping Deforestation
    People's Daily, Beijing, August 24th — According to data from the third national forest resource survey conducted by the Forestry Department, due to deforestation for farming, mining, quarrying, and construction projects, the total area of forest land occupied in the past seven or eight years has reached 2.69 billion mu (approximately 179.4 million hectares), accounting for 6.7% of the country's total forest land. Among this, 57.3 million mu (approximately 3.82 million hectares) of forest has been destroyed. On average, 76 million mu of forest land is occupied and destroyed each year.

    This phenomenon is widespread across the country, particularly prominent in the state-owned forest areas of Northeast China. Statistics show that from 1976 to 1986, in the Heilongjiang Province state-owned forest areas, a large amount of forest land was allocated to state farms and villages for farming, resulting in a total reduction of 127.6 million mu of forest land, accounting for 8% of the province's total state-owned forest area. On average, 12 million mu of forest land is occupied each year. In the Jilin Province state-owned forest areas, 40.5 million mu of forest land was occupied over 10 years, accounting for 8.4% of the province's total state-owned forest area.

    Therefore, relevant departments of the Forestry Department have called out to society and various levels of management departments to strengthen the legal awareness of land management and enhance the understanding of the importance of protecting forest land and forests.

    两亿多亩林地被占  五千万亩森林遭毁
    林业部呼吁制止毁林
    本报北京8月24日讯　据林业部第三次全国森林资源清查资料表明，由于毁林开荒，开矿采石，基本建设等，全国被侵占的林地面积近七八年来已达2.69亿亩（合1794万公顷），占全国林地面积的6.7％，其中被破坏的森林面积为5730万亩（合382万公顷），平均每年被侵占和破坏760万亩。
    这种现象在全国相当普遍，在我国东北国有林区尤为突出。据统计，从1976至1986年的10年期间，黑龙江省国有林区由于将大量林地划拨给国营农场及乡村开荒种地，使该省的林地面积共减少了1276万亩，占全省国有林总面积的8％，平均每年被侵占120万亩。吉林省国有林区在10年内林地面积被侵占了405万亩，占该省国有林区总面积的8.4％。为此，林业部有关部门向社会及各级主管部门大声疾呼，要求加强对全国土地管理的法制观念，提高对保护林地、保护森林的重要意义的认识。　（庄资政）
