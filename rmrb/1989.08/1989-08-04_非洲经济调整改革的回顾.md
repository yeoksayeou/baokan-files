Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 4th.

The economic adjustment and reform of African countries have undergone a decade of arduous and tortuous processes. This is the most profound and extensive transformation that has taken place on the African continent since the 1960s when many countries gained independence. How should we assess the successes and failures of this decade of adjustment and reform? What direction should Africa take in the last decade of this century and the next? Surrounding these issues, there has recently been a profound debate between African countries and the World Bank and Western nations.

The World Bank's Optimistic Assessment

In early March of this year, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme jointly issued a report titled "Adjustment and Growth in Africa in the 1980s," providing an optimistic assessment of the economic recovery and prospects for development in sub-Saharan Africa (also known as Black Africa) over the past few years. The report argues that economic adjustment and reform have significantly promoted economic recovery and growth in the region. Between 1985 and 1987, among the 28 sub-Saharan African countries implementing structural adjustment plans, the 14 countries that vigorously carried out reforms saw an average annual GDP growth of 3.8%, while the countries that either did not implement reforms or did so weakly had an average annual growth rate of only 1.2%. The reforming countries saw an average annual growth in export income of 7.1%, compared to 3.9% for the non-reforming countries. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP in the reforming countries decreased by 10%, while it continued to rise in the non-reforming countries. Agricultural production growth in sub-Saharan Africa was particularly notable, with an average annual growth rate of 4% between 1985 and 1988, surpassing the population growth rate for the first time since 1970. Therefore, the report concluded that the economy of sub-Saharan Africa "has begun to recover" since the mid-1980s.

African Countries Hold Different Views

African countries have expressed clear disagreement with the overly optimistic tone of this report. In early April, the Conference of African Ministers of Economy and Planning unanimously adopted the "African Alternative Framework for Structural Adjustment Programs: A Framework for Reform and Recovery" (hereinafter referred to as the alternative framework). This document directly counters the "orthodox" structural adjustment plans promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund over the past decade, stating that these plans have failed. According to constant 1980 prices, between 1980 and 1987, 19 African countries that implemented strong adjustment and reform measures saw an average annual GDP decline of 1.53%, which was not only lower than the overall economic growth rate for Africa (0.4%) but also significantly lower than the 14 countries that did not implement adjustment and reform (3.1%) and the 12 countries that implemented them weakly (1.22%). The adjustment and reform not only failed to achieve the expected results but also brought about serious social consequences for Africa, including increased unemployment, deteriorating social services, declining educational levels, and deepening poverty.

African Countries' New Proposal

African countries believe that to improve the lives of their people, reduce external dependence, and achieve sustainable growth, it is urgent to formulate a "second-generation" adjustment and reform plan and specific policy framework to replace the current structural adjustment plans.

The core of the alternative framework proposed by African countries consists of a replacement framework and 28 policy measures. The replacement framework is based on three macroeconomic integrations: emphasizing the comprehensive impact of political, economic, technological, environmental, and social factors on development; starting from the available human resources, natural resources, domestic accumulation, and external funds; and meeting the basic needs of the people for essential goods and services. Based on these principles, the 28 policy measures, in addition to absorbing the original structural adjustment plan's emphasis on strengthening fiscal management, focusing on agricultural development, and stimulating export trade, also propose measures more suited to African realities, such as strengthening the relationship between agriculture and industry, encouraging the development of the informal sector and small-scale industries, reducing defense spending and non-productive sector expenditures, banning the import of luxury goods and changing people's consumption habits, implementing family planning and mobilizing women to participate in development, fully utilizing domestic resources, and strengthening regional cooperation.

The African alternative framework, like the World Bank report, has elicited different reactions. International financial institutions and Western countries have responded coolly, and some media have even labeled it as "regression."

Pros and Cons of New and Old Plans and the Debate

In fact, both the structural adjustment plan and the alternative framework have their pros and cons. Practice has shown that the structural adjustment plan, to some extent, helps African countries alleviate their immediate fiscal crises, restrain unrealistic economic policies and social corruption, and has a positive role in helping African countries overcome their current economic difficulties. However, this plan also has the drawbacks of treating symptoms rather than root causes, exceeding the capacity of some African countries to bear, potentially disrupting the national economy, or damaging national sovereignty, and needs further modification and improvement. While it is too early to give a positive evaluation of the alternative framework, it can be seen that its basic concept is positive. It absorbs the reasonable content of the original World Bank and IMF structural adjustment plans and proposes some policies and measures more suited to African characteristics.

The debate over Africa's economic adjustment and reform is taking place against the backdrop of a turning point in the international situation, severe challenges facing African countries, and the adjustment and reform being at a critical juncture. Facing the new situation of global industrial restructuring and intensified economic competition, African countries deeply feel the danger of being further "neglected," "forgotten," and "permanently trapped in economic backwardness." They are concerned about losing the remaining time in the last decade of this century and are therefore analyzing and evaluating the structural adjustment plan in depth with a sense of urgency and crisis, and are striving to explore a development path suitable for African countries.

Of course, it should also be noted that the World Bank and other international financial organizations and Western donor countries are also considering the strong reactions of African countries and will make some modifications to the structural adjustment plan.

African countries have a weak production base, an irrational economic structure, and an underdeveloped market. Therefore, they believe that the structural adjustment plan does not suit the national conditions of African countries. However, Africa's economic adjustment and reform cannot do without Western financial support. It seems that, for the time being, the consensus and differences reflected in the African development strategy indicate that both sides will continue to cooperate while not stopping the struggle. The basic pattern of cooperation and struggle will not change significantly in the near future. However, in the future, the South-North contradictions and friction over African development issues may become more pronounced, and Africa's economic development will face an even more complex situation.

    非洲经济调整改革的回顾
    孔明辉　刘贵金
    非洲国家的经济调整和改革，迄今已走过10年艰难、曲折的历程。这是60年代前后获得独立以来，非洲大陆发生的最深刻、广泛的变革。如何评估这10年调整改革的成败得失？本世纪最后10年乃至下一世纪非洲应朝什么方向发展？围绕这些问题，最近非洲国家与世界银行及西方国家之间展开了一场意义深远的论争。
    世界银行评估乐观
    今年3月初，世界银行和联合国开发计划署联名发表题为《80年代非洲的调整和增长》的报告，对近年来撒哈拉以南非洲（又称黑非洲）经济复苏的情况及其发展前景作出了乐观的评估。报告认为，经济调改有力地促进了该地区的经济复苏和增长。1985—1987年期间，在28个执行结构调整计划的黑非洲国家中，14个大力进行改革的国家国内生产总值年均增长3.8％，而改革不力或未改革的国家年均增长率仅为1.2％；进行改革的国家出口收入年均增长达7.1％，而未改革的国家这一增长率仅为3.9％；坚持改革的国家财政赤字在国内生产总值中所占的比例下降了10％，而未进行改革的国家财政赤字有增无减。黑非洲农业生产的增长尤为明显，1985—1988年间年均增长率达4％，1970年以来首次超过人口增长率。因此，报告得出80年代中期以来黑非洲经济“已经开始复苏”的结论。
    非洲国家持有异议
    非洲国家对此报告的“过分乐观”基调持有明显异议。4月初，非洲国家经济、计划部长会议一致通过了《结构调整计划非洲替代方案：改革和复苏的框架》（以下简称替代方案）。这份文件针锋相对地指出，世行和国际货币基金组织过去10年在非洲推行的“正统”结构调整计划遭到失败。按1980年不变价格计算，在1980—1987年间，19个采取有力调改措施的非洲国家，国内生产总值年均下降1.53％，不仅低于全非洲的经济增幅
  （0.4％），而且也远不如未实行调改的14国（3.1％）和调改不力的12国（1.22％）。调改不仅未达预期目的，而且还为非洲带来了失业增加、社会服务恶化、教育水平下降、贫困程度加深等严重社会后果。
  非洲国家的新方案
    非洲国家认为，为了改善人民生活，减少对外依赖和实现持续增长，亟需制定“第二代”调改方案和具体政策框架，以取代现行的结构调整计划。
    非洲国家提出的替代方案的核心内容是一个替代框架和28项政策措施。替代框架是以三个宏观统一体为基础的，即注重政治、经济、科技、环境、社会等多种因素对发展的综合作用；从可供利用的人力、自然资源以及国内积累和外来资金出发；照顾人民对最必需商品和服务的基本需求。以此为准则制定的28项政策措施，除吸收了原结构调整计划中加强财政管理、重视农业发展、刺激外贸出口等内容外，还提出了加强工农业内部关系、鼓励非正规部门和小型工业发展、削减国防费用及非生产部门开支、禁止奢侈品进口和改变人民消费习惯、实行计划生育和动员妇女参与发展、充分利用本国资源、加强地区合作等较适合非洲实际的具体措施。
    非洲替代方案和世行报告一样，引起不同的反响。国际金融机构和西方国家对此反应冷淡，有的舆论甚至称之为“走回头路”。
  新旧方案利弊及争论
    其实，结构调整计划和替代方案都各有利弊。实践表明，结调计划在一定程度上有助于非洲国家缓解财政方面的燃眉之急，制约不合实际的经济政策和社会腐败，对非洲国家克服目前的经济困难有积极的作用。但是，这一计划也存在治标不治本，超过某些非洲国家的承受能力，有可能冲击民族经济或损害国家主权等诸多弊端，需要进一步修改和完善。对替代方案作出肯定评价虽尚为时过早，但可以看出，它的基本构思是积极的。它吸收了原世行、基金组织结调计划中的合理内容，提出了一些更适合非洲特点的政策和措施。
    围绕非洲经济调改进行的论争，是在国际形势出现转折性变化、非洲国家面临严峻挑战、经济调改处于进退关口的背景下发生的。面对世界产业结构调整和经济竞争加剧的新形势，非洲国家深感有被进一步“冷落”、“遗忘”并“永远陷入经济落后状态的危险”，担心再失去本世纪最后10年时间，因而以某种急迫感和忧患意识，对结调计划进行深入剖析和评判，并努力探索符合非洲国家国情的发展道路。
    当然，也要看到世行等国际金融组织和西方捐助国也在考虑非洲国家的强烈反映，对结构调整计划将进行一些修改。
    非洲国家生产基础薄弱，经济结构不合理，市场发育不健全，因此，它们认为，结构调整计划不符合非洲国家的国情。但非洲的经济调整改革，又离不开西方的财政支持。看来，当前在非洲发展战略问题上反映出的共识和歧见，表明双方既要继续合作又不会停止斗争的基本格局，近期内不会有大的变化。但今后在非洲发展问题上的南北矛盾和摩擦有可能较前突出，非洲的经济发展将面临更为复杂的局面。
