Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, said today that China has made some attempts in reforming its science and technology system in recent years, and these attempts have been basically successful and should be continued; of course, they also need to be summarized and improved.

Li Peng made these remarks when he met with a North Korean government science and technology delegation led by Chairman Li Zifang of the State Science and Technology Commission in Zhongnanhai.

He said that in the field of science and technology, two main relationships need to be handled well: one is the relationship between serving the current national economic construction and serving long-term development; the other is the relationship between basic scientific research and applied research and development.

Premier Li Peng said that basic science may not immediately bring economic benefits, but it is the foundation for a country's scientific and technological development and should not be neglected. However, he said, we should continue to focus our main efforts on applied research and development, directly serving the construction of the "Four Modernizations."

Li Peng said: Overall, the science and technology community has handled these two aspects well.

Li Peng introduced to the guests that China has recently emphasized the transformation of science and technology into productive forces and has conducted some experiments. One experiment is that research institutions hand over their research achievements to enterprises for production and conversion into commodities, while some enterprises themselves have research institutions for development and research; another experiment is that research institutions themselves operate enterprises, directly promoting research achievements, and developing and producing commodities. He pointed out that this is "completely different from just operating in the circulation sector" and should be maintained and developed.

Li Peng also said that agriculture accounts for a large proportion of China's national economy, and developing agriculture is always a major theme in developing the national economy. Developing agriculture relies on three things: policy, investment, and science; but investment should largely be in agricultural science and technology.

He said that to quickly promote agricultural science and technology achievements to agricultural production, China has implemented the "Spark Program" and has achieved some results, which should be continued and improved.

When talking about the lessons learned from the suppression of the riots, Li Peng said: In the future, we must adhere to "two hands at the same time," that is, one hand to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and the other hand to promote reform and opening up; both hands should use equal force, changing the past situation of one hand being strong and the other hand being weak.

When talking about Sino-North Korean friendship, Li Peng said that China and North Korea are brotherly countries, and the friendship between the Chinese and North Korean peoples is forged in blood, and this friendship will be passed down from generation to generation. He hoped that the friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries would continue to develop. He also expressed satisfaction with the development of science and technology cooperation between the two countries and hoped that the science and technology communities of the two countries would learn from each other and help each other.

Li Zifang introduced to Li Peng the achievements made by the North Korean people in socialist construction. He hoped to strengthen cooperation between the science and technology communities of the two countries.

State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian participated in the meeting.

### 李鹏会见朝鲜政府科技代表团时说  我国科技体制改革基本成功

    李鹏会见朝鲜政府科技代表团时说
    我国科技体制改革基本成功
    新华社北京8月8日电　（记者周树春）国务院总理李鹏今天说，中国近年来在科技体制改革方面做了一些尝试，基本是成功的，要坚持下去；当然也需要总结完善。
    李鹏是在中南海会见由国家科学技术委员会委员长李子方率领的朝鲜政府科技代表团时说这番话的。
    他说，在科技领域主要应处理好两个方面的关系：一是科技为当前国民经济建设服务和为长远发展服务之间的关系；二是基础科学研究和应用研究开发之间的关系。
    李鹏总理说，基础科学不一定马上能带来经济效益，然而它是一个国家科技发展的基础，所以不可忽视。但他说，仍应坚持把主要的力量投入应用研究与开发，直接为“四化”建设服务。
    李鹏说：总的来说，科技界对这两个方面的关系的处理是好的。
    李鹏向客人介绍说，中国近年来重视将科学技术转化为生产力，并进行了一些尝试。一种尝试是：科研机构将科研成果转交给企业生产变成商品，而一些企业本身也设有科研机构，进行开发研究；另一种尝试是：科研机构自己办企业，直接推广科研成果，自己开发、生产商品。他指出，这与单纯在流通领域内的经营“完全是两回事，要保持和发展下去”。
    李鹏还说，农业在中国国民经济中占很大比重，发展农业始终是发展国民经济的一个主题。发展农业一靠政策，二靠投入，三靠科学；但投入在很大程度上应当是在农业科技方面的投入。
    他说，为尽快把农业科技成果推广到农业生产中去，中国实施了“星火计划”，并已取得了一定的成果，应坚持不断发展，加以完善。
    李鹏在谈到平暴的经验教训时说：今后一定要坚持“两手一起抓，即一手坚持四项基本原则，一手抓改革开放；两只手使用一样的力量，改变过去一手硬、一手软的状况”。
    谈到中朝友谊时，李鹏说，中朝两国是兄弟之邦，中朝人民之间的友谊是用鲜血凝成的，这种友谊将世世代代地传下去。他希望两国间的友好合作关系不断发展。他还对两国科技合作的发展表示满意，希望两国科技界互相学习，互相帮助。
    李子方向李鹏介绍了朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得的成就。他希望加强朝中两国科技界的合作。
    国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健参加了会见。
