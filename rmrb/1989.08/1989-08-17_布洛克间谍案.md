Recently, American news media revealed that Felix Bloch, a senior diplomat at the U.S. State Department, is suspected of acting as a Soviet spy and is currently under investigation. The public opinion believes that if this case is proven, it will be the largest diplomatic spy case in the United States in 40 years.

Bloch is 54 years old and is an experienced American diplomat. In 1980, he was assigned to work at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, Austria. Four years later, he was promoted to the second-in-command of the embassy, which gave him the opportunity to access confidential documents and learn the list of American intelligence agents in Vienna. He left his post and returned to the U.S. in 1987. This June, it was suspected that during his tenure in Vienna, he had unauthorized contact with Soviet individuals and had personally handed over a briefcase, possibly containing certain documents, to a Soviet man in Paris earlier this year. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials believe that the Soviet man is a spy, and during his visit to Austria, he regularly met with Bloch in Vienna. These circumstances have been verified and confirmed by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior. However, the Austrian police have not been able to prove that the man is a Soviet spy.

In late June, the FBI conducted the first brief interrogation of Bloch. Surprisingly, Bloch admitted on the spot that he had received "a large amount of money" from the Soviet intelligence agency over the years and had been working for the Soviet Union for many years. However, he refused to disclose any possible spy activities or motives. The FBI, however, lacks conclusive evidence and cannot charge him with any crime.

Recently, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze commented on the Bloch incident, saying it was a fabrication by the United States.

The United States will not let this case go. It is reported that the FBI has sent personnel to relevant regions for investigation, but it is unknown when the case will be solved.

    布洛克间谍案
    董健
    前不久，美国新闻媒介披露，美国国务院高级外交官弗利克斯·布洛克涉嫌充当苏联间谍，现正在审查中。舆论界认为，如果此案成立，这将是40年来美国最大的一宗外交间谍案。
    布洛克现年54岁，是美国一名老资格的外交官。1980年，他被派驻美国驻奥地利维也纳大使馆工作。4年后，升任为使馆第2号人物，这使他有机会接触机密资料和了解美国在维也纳的特工人员的名单。1987年离任回国。今年6月，他被怀疑在维也纳任职期间未获准许擅自与苏联人接触，并曾在今年早些时候于巴黎将一可能装有某类文件的公文包亲手交与一名苏联男子。联邦调查局人士认为，那名苏联男子是苏联间谍，他在奥地利旅游期间，在维也纳定期与布洛克会面。这些情况已为奥地利内政部查证核实。但奥地利警方却未能证明那个男子是苏联间谍。
    6月下旬，联邦调查局对布洛克进行了第一次短暂问话，出人意外的是，布洛克竟当面承认多年来接受了苏联情报机关的“大量金钱”，已替苏联工作多年。但是，他拒绝交待任何可能的间谍活动和行动动机。而联邦调查局又苦于没有确凿的证据，无法指控以任何罪状。
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德那泽最近在谈到布洛克事件时说，这是美国无中生有。
    美国自然不会放过此案。据说，美国联邦调查局已派出人员，赴有关地区调查，何时能够揭案，尚不得而知。
