The much-anticipated first phase of the Yangtze River Middle and Upper Reaches Forest Protection System has been approved by the state and is now underway. This follows the globally renowned "Three-North" Forest Protection System, which has risen along the northern desert line, and is another large-scale forest protection system in China's severely eroded areas.

The project will initially focus on regions with low forest coverage and severe soil erosion. It will cover 145 counties across nine provinces, including Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, with a planned afforestation and reforestation area of 100 million mu.

The project is scheduled to be completed in approximately 15 years. The State Planning Commission, in its approval, stated that the implementation of the plan will primarily rely on local organizations mobilizing the masses to contribute labor, with the necessary funds to be raised and solved by the local authorities. Each region should follow the overall planning requirements, arrange the construction schedule according to local financial capabilities and the farmers' ability to bear the costs, and avoid cultivating land that is not suitable for agriculture. Gradually, farmland will be converted back to forests, and local governments must take effective measures to ensure grain supply within the grain contract quotas for regions that have converted farmland back to forests.

    不使长江变黄河　先教沿岸绿万里
    长江中上游建设防护林体系
    一期工程上马9省145县15年造林亿亩
    本报讯　令人注目的长江中上游防护林体系建设第一期工程总体规划，近日经国家正式批准，开始实施。这是继举世瞩目的“三北”防护林体系在北部万里风沙线上崛起之后，我国在重度水土流失区的一个规模宏大的防护林体系建设。
    这项工程首先在森林覆盖率低，水土流失严重的地区展开。范围包括青海、甘肃、陕西、云南、贵州、四川、湖南、湖北、江西等9省145个县，计划完成造林、育林面积1亿亩。
    这项工程规划用15年左右时间完成。国家计委在批复中提出，规划的实施，主要靠地方组织群众投劳，所必需的资金，由地方筹集解决。各地应遵循总体规划要求，根据本地财力和农民承担能力，适当安排建设进度。不宜搞农业的耕地，要逐步退耕还林，地方政府必须采取有效措施，在粮食包干指标内，保证退耕还林地区的粮食供应。
