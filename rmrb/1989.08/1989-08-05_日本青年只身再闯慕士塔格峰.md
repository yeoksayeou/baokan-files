A Japanese youth, Shozaki Junichi, who recently left his footprint on the Tian Shan Snow Lotus Peak, bid farewell to his fellow climbers who were about to return home and set off alone towards Muztagh Ata, the third highest peak in the Pamirs. No one could persuade him to stay.

The 26-year-old Shozaki Junichi exudes courage and determination the moment you meet him. This time, as a member of the Sino-Japanese joint expedition team, he conquered the 6,450-meter-high Snow Lotus Peak, a significant victory for him. In 1985 and 1986, he had attempted to climb the peak twice but failed due to avalanches and harsh weather conditions. "If I don't succeed this time, I'll commit seppuku!" he told reporters before the expedition.

Some had predicted: Unless an outstanding mountaineer like the Italian Reinhold Messner, it is almost unimaginable for anyone to climb the steep Muztagh Ata alone. Known as the "Father of Ice Mountains" by local Kyrgyz and Tajik minorities, Muztagh Ata actually consists of five adjacent peaks, with the main peak reaching 7,546 meters. Below 5,000 meters, the terrain is a mix of ice, rocks, and moraines. Above this altitude, it is a world of white snow, with snow depths reaching 200 meters and crevasses crisscrossing the landscape.

This time, the young Shozaki Junichi is determined to challenge the prediction and prove it wrong with his actions. He has six to seven years of climbing experience in various parts of the world, and he is also a doctor.

The Xinjiang Natural Adventure Travel Agency has dispatched two experienced high-altitude assistants to help Shozaki Junichi transport high-altitude supplies and serve as guides. According to the plan, tomorrow will be the day Shozaki Junichi sets up his base camp at the foot of Muztagh Ata.

### 日本青年只身再闯慕士塔格峰

    日本青年只身再闯慕士塔格峰
    新华社乌鲁木齐8月5日电　（记者姜志武）不知是觉得没有过瘾，还是高兴疯了——刚刚把足迹留在天山雪莲峰上的日本青年箫崎纯一，前天上午毅然告别了正要凯旋回国的登顶伙伴，又只身冲向了帕米尔高原上的第三高峰慕士塔格峰。谁也无法把他挽留。
    今年26岁的箫崎纯一，一见面就能让你感觉到他那勇敢而坚毅的性格。这次作为中日联合探险队成员，征服海拔6450米的雪莲峰，对他来讲可真是一个很不寻常的胜利。因为1985年和1986年，他曾两次随队前来攀登此峰，但都由于雪崩和气候恶劣等缘故而告败北。“第三次再不成功，我就剖腹啦！”进山前他对记者说。
    有人曾预言：除非像意大利人梅斯纳尔那样杰出的登山家，否则要想只身登上峭峻的慕士塔格峰，简直不可想象。被当地柯尔克孜、塔吉克等少数民族称为“冰山之父”的慕士塔格峰，实际上共由5个比邻的山峰组成，主峰海拔高度为7546米。此峰从海拔5000米以下为冰碛岩石区，以上是白皑皑的冰雪世界，积雪厚达200米，冰裂缝纵横交错。
    这次，年轻的箫崎纯一已下决心闯一闯，要以实际行动来击碎这一预言。因为，他已有六、七年在世界各地登山的经验，再说他本人又是一名医生。
    新疆大自然旅行社已派出两名老资格的高山协助人员，为箫崎纯一运送高山物资和担任向导。按行动计划，明天，是箫崎纯一在慕峰脚下建起大本营的日子。
