Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd.

The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued a notice on August 15th regarding the surrender and confession of criminals involved in embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and other crimes within a specified period. By August 21st, a total of 288 criminals involved in embezzlement, bribery, and other crimes had surrendered to various levels of people's procuratorates across the country, turning over 1,415,000 yuan in illicit gains. Some detainees also confessed and revealed their crimes.

According to relevant departments of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, these surrendered and confessed cases have five notable characteristics: First, there are many major cases. Among the surrendered criminals, 76 individuals involved amounts over 100,000 yuan, accounting for one-quarter of the surrendered criminals. In Shandong Province, a criminal, taking advantage of business connections, embezzled and accepted bribes totaling over 150,000 yuan from 1987 onwards. He surrendered to the county procuratorate on August 16th and handed over all the illicit gains on the spot. Second, a significant proportion of the cases involve leaders and officials. There are 18 county-level and division-level officials among these cases. A county magistrate in Yunnan Province surrendered to the county procuratorate on August 20th, confessing to accepting bribes worth 16,000 yuan, a Royal Crown refrigerator, and a 20-inch Hitachi color television. Third, some criminals who have been previously dealt with have voluntarily revealed past concealed issues. In July, Gao Shouxiang, the deputy director of a power station in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years, for the crime of speculation. Zhang Aming, the director of a factory in the suburbs of Jiaxing City, was exempted from prosecution in early this year for the crime of bribery. After hearing the notice, they both confessed their bribery issues to the local people's procuratorates. Fourth, criminals who previously did not confess their crimes have started to actively confess. In Yixing City, Jiangsu Province, a criminal who had been repeatedly questioned by the procuratorate but refused to confess, listened to the notice on August 15th and confessed his embezzlement and bribery crimes at 9 PM that night, turning over 25,000 yuan and four gold rings. Fifth, there is a drive to gain merit by actively exposing other criminals. Some surrenders have exposed more than 10 case leads at once. In Shanghai, part of the district and county detention centers, after hearing the notice, 34 detainees successively exposed 64 case leads.

    高法高检《通告》发布一周  二百多犯罪分子投案自首
    交出赃款141万余元
    新华社北京8月23日电  最高人民法院、最高人民检察院8月15日发布关于贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪分子限期自首坦白的通告后，到8月21日，全国已有288名贪污、受贿等犯罪分子向各级人民检察院投案自首，并交出赃款141.5万元，一些在押犯也坦白交代了罪行。
    据最高人民检察院有关部门介绍，这批自首坦白的案件有五个特点：一是大案较多。在投案自首案犯中，万元以上有76人，占自首案犯1／4。山东省一个犯罪分子，自1987年以来，利用联系业务之便，贪污、受贿15万余元。他16日到县检察院投案自首，并当场交出全部赃款。二是领导干部占一定比例，这些案件中有县处级干部18人。云南省一个县长20日到县检察院投案自首，交代他受贿16000元、皇冠牌电冰箱一台、日立牌20英寸彩电一台等犯罪事实。三是已被处理过的犯罪分子自动交待过去隐瞒的问题。浙江省嘉兴市电力局某站副站长高寿祥，今年7月因犯投机倒把罪被判处有期徒刑2年、缓刑2年；嘉兴市郊区某厂厂长张阿美因犯受贿罪，今年初被免予起诉，他们听了《通告》后，分别向所在地人民检察院交代了他们的受贿问题。四是过去不坦白交代罪行的犯罪分子开始积极坦白交代。江苏省宜兴市一名犯罪分子，检察院曾多次找他谈话，均不交代问题。15日晚听了《通告》后，于当晚9时坦白交代了贪污、受贿的犯罪事实，并交出赃款25000元和4只金戒指。五是争取立功，积极检举揭发其他犯罪分子。有的投案自首者一次就检举出10多条案件线索。上海市部分区、县看守所的犯人听了《通告》后，先后有34人检举64条案件线索。
