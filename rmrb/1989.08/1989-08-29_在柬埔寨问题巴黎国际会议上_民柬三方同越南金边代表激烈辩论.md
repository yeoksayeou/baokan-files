In the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian Issue, the leaders of the three Khmer resistance factions sharply refuted the statements made by the Vietnamese and Phnom Penh representatives, leading to a heated debate.

According to reports, during the ministerial-level meeting of the international conference this afternoon, Hun Sen of the Phnom Penh regime made his seventh speech. He opposed a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue, taking a stance contrary to that of most participants. He even advocated maintaining the status quo of the Phnom Penh government after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, insisting that "a four-party interim government absolutely cannot be established," because, he claimed, establishing such a government "would actually legalize the Khmer Rouge." He also stated that the international conference should "condemn the Khmer Rouge's policy of genocide." When discussing the dangers of Vietnamese illegal immigration in Cambodia, as raised by various committees in the second phase of the conference, Hun Sen defended himself by saying that the number of Vietnamese immigrants was small and that raising this issue was purely deceptive, among other things.

In response to Hun Sen's speech, Sihanouk took the floor to present a map showing the distribution of Vietnamese illegal immigrants along the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, effectively refuting Hun Sen's statements in support of Vietnam. Regarding the issue of "genocide," Sihanouk had long advocated that it should include the policies implemented by Vietnam since its invasion of Cambodia. However, he said, it is not necessary to use the term "genocide"; instead, he suggested using the term "trampling on human rights" as a substitute. He reiterated the need to establish a four-party interim joint government. He said, "Hun Sen is a Vietnamese-influenced Khmer, Lon Nol is an American-influenced Khmer, while the Khmer Rouge are the true Khmer," therefore, the four-party government cannot exclude the Khmer Rouge.

The Chairman of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, Son Sann, and the Chairman of the Khmer Resistance, Khieu Samphan, both expressed strong support for Prince Sihanouk's proposals for a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue in their speeches.

The speeches of the opposing sides on the Cambodian issue indicate that Nguyen Co Thach and Hun Sen have no intention of resolving the issue. They are the obstacles to reaching an agreement at this Paris International Conference.

    在柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议上
    民柬三方同越南金边代表激烈辩论
    据新华社巴黎8月28日电　（记者杨木、沈孝泉）柬埔寨抵抗力量领袖西哈努克及其他两方领导人宋双和乔森潘今天下午在柬埔寨问题国际会议上严正驳斥越南和金边当局的发言，双方展开了激烈的辩论。
    据悉，在今天下午的国际会议部长级会议上，金边当局的洪森第7个发言。他反对全面政治解决柬埔寨问题，与大多数与会者持对立态度。他居然主张在越南撤军后维持金边政权的现状，“绝对不能成立四方临时政府”，因为，成立这样的政府，“实际上只能使红色高棉合法化”。他还说什么国际会议应“谴责红色高棉的灭绝种族政策”。谈到国际会议第二阶段各委员会纷纷提出的越南在柬埔寨非法移民的危险性时，洪森辩解说，越南移民为数不多，提出这个问题纯属欺骗，等等。
    针对洪森讲话，西哈努克即席发言并出示越南非法移民分布在柬埔寨湄公河和洞里萨湖沿岸的图表，有力地驳斥洪森为越南张目的表态。至于“灭绝种族”政策问题，西哈努克早就主张应包括越南侵柬以来所实施的政策。但是，他说，不使用“灭绝种族”字眼也可以，建议用“践踏人权”的字眼来代替它。他重申必须建立四方临时联合政府的主张。他说：“洪森是一个越南化的高棉人，朗诺是美国化的高棉人，而红色高棉却是真正的高棉人”，因此，四方政府不能排除红色高棉。
    高棉人民民族解放阵线主席宋双和民柬方面主席乔森潘在发言中表示坚决支持西哈努克主席在全面解决柬问题方面的主张。
    在柬埔寨问题上对立的双方的发言表明，阮基石和洪森毫无解决问题的诚意。他们是这次巴黎国际会议未能取得协议的障碍。
