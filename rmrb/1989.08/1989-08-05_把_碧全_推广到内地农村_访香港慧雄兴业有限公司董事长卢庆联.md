Promoting "Biqiquan" to Rural Areas in Mainland China
— An Interview with Lu Qinglian, Chairman of Hong Kong Hui Xiong Industry Limited

Reporter: Xie Rongzhen

The footsteps of Mr. Lu Qinglian, Chairman of Hong Kong Hui Xiong Industry Limited, have traversed many rural areas in mainland China. Recently, the reporter interviewed him in Hong Kong.

He said: "Over the past two years, I have devoted most of my energy to mainland China, mainly to rural areas. I have visited more than ten provinces in South China, East China, Central China, and Northeast China." Everywhere he went, he worked with farmers and technicians, conducting experiments in fields, orchards, and vegetable plots.

"Going to the countryside is a tough job, but I do it willingly," said Mr. Lu calmly. Last winter, he and a Taiwanese agricultural expert went to the experimental station in Qianjiazhuang, Shanxi Province, to conduct experiments. They took a plane from Beijing and arrived in Taiyuan at 2 PM, without having lunch. They hastily bought some snacks to fill their stomachs and then rented a taxi to Qianjiazhuang, arriving at 4 AM. The temperature was below zero, and Mr. Lu was both cold and hungry. After eating a bowl of hot noodles provided by a farmer, he felt a bit warmer. As soon as it was light, Mr. Lu went to the experimental field and started working with the farmers. After finishing the experiment at this point, he hurried to another experimental site. Over the past two years, Mr. Lu has been constantly traveling in rural areas.

Mr. Lu, in his forties, is a rising industrialist in Hong Kong. He promotes a plant growth stimulant called "Biqiquan" in rural areas.

"Biqiquan" is an amino acid developed by a Taiwanese agricultural expert after more than thirty years of repeated experiments. It contains calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, and other nutrients essential for plants. After being applied in Taiwan and some regions in Southeast Asia, it is considered to have the advantages of low dosage, low cost, high efficiency, and no toxicity, showing significant effects in increasing crop yields.

Relevant local governments and agricultural research institutions in mainland China have actively cooperated with Mr. Lu in conducting experiments. Good news about increased crop yields after applying "Biqiquan" has been reported from various experimental sites:

In 1987, the Shenyang Agricultural Science Research Institute conducted experiments on over 8,600 mu (approximately 573 hectares) in some counties, resulting in a 16.5% increase in crop yields and a more than 20% increase in vegetable yields, with an added benefit of 780 million yuan.

In 1988, Zhejiang Agricultural University's experiments in Huangyan County and other places showed that barley yields increased by 16%, rice yields increased by more than 20%, and citrus yields per tree increased by 20% to 200%.

Similarly, good news came from Quanzhou, Beijing, and Anhui. Experiments showed that in areas affected by droughts and floods, "Biqiquan" demonstrated its power. In Hangzhou, a rice field was flooded for seven days, but still had a 75% harvest. In contrast, fields without "Biqiquan" almost completely failed.

The initial success further boosted Mr. Lu's confidence in promoting "Biqiquan."

He said: "I promote 'Biqiquan' in mainland China not for profit but to help develop agriculture here. One should not live solely for money; one should also have ideals and goals. Seeing that some rural areas in mainland China are still backward and poor, as a Chinese, I feel a responsibility to help farmers become wealthy." He feels that his personal efforts are limited and hopes to gain support from relevant departments in mainland China to promote the wider application of "Biqiquan" in more rural areas. Last August, he donated one ton of "Biqiquan" and 150,000 yuan in promotion fees to the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture without any compensation. So far, he has spent over 1 million yuan on promoting "Biqiquan" in mainland China.

After the Beijing massacre, he still believes that mainland China will continue its path of reform and opening up. He plans to expand his investments in mainland China, envisioning the establishment of a factory to produce "Biqiquan" so that more farmers can benefit. Additionally, his company signed a contract with Boluo County, Guangdong Province, in July, planning to invest 700,000 US dollars to develop 13,000 mu (approximately 867 hectares) of barren mountains into a farm.

    把“碧全”推广到内地农村
    ——访香港慧雄兴业有限公司董事长卢庆联
    本报记者　谢荣镇
    香港慧雄兴业有限公司董事长卢庆联先生的足迹遍布内地许多乡村。近日，记者在港采访了他。
    他说：“两年多来，我将大部分精力放在内地，主要是往农村跑。跑了华南、华东、中原、东北的十多个省份。”每到一地，他都和农民、科技人员一起，在农田、果园、菜地里做试验。
    “到农村去是件苦事，但我完全自愿。”卢先生淡淡地说。去年冬天，他和台湾一位农业专家到山西隰县千家庄的试验站做实验。他们乘飞机从北京出发，下午两点钟来到太原，顾不上吃午饭，随便买点零食充饥，便租辆出租车赶到千家庄，已是凌晨四点钟，零下十多摄氏度，卢先生又冷又饿，吃了一碗农民送来的热面条，才暖和一些。天一亮，卢先生就来到试验田边，和农民一起做试验。这个点的试验做完了，又匆匆赶到别的试验点。两年多来，卢先生就这样在农村不停地奔波。
    四十来岁的卢先生是香港新崛起的实业家。他去农村推广一种叫“碧全”的植物健生素。
    “碧全”是一位台湾农业专家经过三十多年反复试验制成的氨基酸，它含有钙、镁、氮等多种植物必需的营养。经在台湾和东南亚一些地区应用，被认为具有用量少、成本低、效益高、无毒害等特点，对农作物增产作用明显。
    内地有关的地方政府和农业科研机构，积极配合卢先生进行试验。各试验点纷纷传来施用“碧全”后农作物获增产的消息：
    沈阳市农业科学研究所1987年在一些县试验面积8600多亩，其中农作物增产16.5％，蔬菜增产二成多，增加效益780万元。
    浙江农业大学1988年在黄岩县等地的试验表明，大麦亩产增16％，水稻亩产增二成余，柑橘单株产量可增20％至二倍。
    泉州、北京、安徽传来的消息同样喜人。试验表明，在那些遭受旱涝自然灾害的地区，“碧全”显示了威力。在杭州，一个试验田的水稻被洪水淹了7天，最后仍有七成五的收成。而没有施用“碧全”的几乎全部失收。
    初见成效，更增加了卢先生推广“碧全”的信心。
    他说：“我在内地推广‘碧全’，绝对不是为了赚钱，完全是为了帮助内地发展农业。做人不能光为钱而活，还要有理想和追求目标。看到内地一些农村还落后、贫困，作为一个中国人，我感到有责任帮助农民致富。”他感到自己个人的力量有限，希望得到内地有关部门的支持，使“碧全”在内地更多的农村得到推广应用。去年8月，他无偿向中国农业部提供一吨“碧全”和15万元人民币推广费。至今，他已为推广“碧全”在大陆开支100多万元。
    北京平暴之后，他仍相信大陆会继续走开放改革的路。他打算扩大在内地的投资，设想开办一家工厂生产“碧全”，以便让更多的农民受益。此外，他的公司7月份已与广东博罗县签约，计划投资70万美元，开发1.3万亩荒山开办一农场。
