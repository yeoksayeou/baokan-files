    Bordering the Yangtze River, the largest river in China, and nestled by Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, and adjacent to the world-renowned tourist destination of Mount Lu, Jiujiang is a jewel created by nature, a brilliant gem on the golden waterway!

    "Land routes through five mountain ranges, waterways connecting three rivers," Jiujiang has been a bustling commercial port since ancient times. The reputation of being one of the "four major rice markets" and "three major tea markets," the famous poems of literary figures, and the iron hoofs of British, French, and Japanese imperialist invaders have all left their marks, making Jiujiang's historical scroll a tapestry of love and hate, joy and sorrow.

    Forty years of vigorous socialist construction have cleaned away the dust of history from this gem, infusing life and vitality into the famous mountains, lakes, rivers, caves, and cities.

    Today, Jiujiang has become an important grain and cotton production area in Jiangxi Province, with cotton production accounting for two-thirds of the province's total. The production of oil, ramie, and aquatic products ranks among the top in the province. The textile, petroleum, chemical, building materials, shipbuilding, and power industries are robust, playing a crucial role in the economic development of Jiangxi Province. The largest organic silicon production plant in the country, the Starfire Chemical Factory, the first production line in the country for 300 refrigerated containers per year, Jiangxi Oxygen Plant, the first batch of foreign trade ports in the country and the only one in Jiangxi Province, the Jiujiang Refinery with an annual processing capacity of 2.5 million tons of crude oil, the Jiangxi Wool Textile Mill with precision combing and dyeing integration, the Jiujiang Chemical Fiber Plant with an annual production capacity of 10,000 tons of chemical fiber pulp, the first ultra-high temperature and high-pressure unit in the province, the Jiujiang Thermal Power Plant, the largest chlor-alkali enterprise in the province, the Jiujiang Chemical Plant, and the famous domestic and international Qingnian Reclamation Farm producing Yaya brand down products, as well as some military-industrial enterprises, are all shining stars in Jiujiang.

    The 10-year reform wave has prompted Jiangxi's decision-makers and Jiujiang's builders to re-evaluate Jiujiang's advantages, shifting their development vision from regional boundaries to the Yangtze River development zone, and nurturing a new strategic concept: to focus on developing Jiujiang and accelerate the development and construction of northern Jiangxi.

    Opening up and developing, Jiujiang's economic construction has thus entered a broader realm. Twenty-one key projects of Jiangxi Province's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" are located in Jiujiang, with a total investment of 2.64 billion yuan, of which 10 have been completed. The Dashan Railway has been put into operation; the state-invested foreign trade wharf has been put into use and is preparing for foreign ship navigation; the 10,000-line program-controlled telephone and optical cable communication facilities have been put into use; viscose filament, polyvinyl chloride, and other raw material industry projects have been completed and put into production. The much-anticipated Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge is expected to be completed by the end of next year; the second phase of the Jiujiang Power Plant is under construction; the Chang-Jiu Expressway, the Jiujiang Refinery with an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 500,000 tons of urea, and other projects are in the preparatory stage. All of this has accelerated the development of energy, transportation, and raw material industries, laying a solid foundation for the economic takeoff of Jiujiang and Jiangxi. Seizing this opportunity, Jiangxi Province is fully utilizing Jiujiang's advantageous geographical location at the forefront of the east-west development gradient in China and the existing economic foundation to build a large market in the neighboring areas of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, open up to the outside world, and strengthen its position in the economic pattern of the Yangtze River basin.

    Jiujiang will rise to meet a brighter tomorrow!

    北港—九江，展开恢宏的历史画卷
    北濒我国第一大河长江，东枕我国第一大淡水湖鄱阳湖，南傍饮誉中外的旅游胜地庐山，九江——大自然造就的天之骄子，黄金水道上一颗璀璨的明珠！
    “陆通五岭，势拒三江”，使这里自古便成为“来商纳贾”、“舟船辐辏”的商埠；“四大米市”、“三大茶市”的盛誉，文人骚客吟咏的千古名篇，英、法、日帝国主义侵略者践踏的铁蹄，又使九江波澜起伏的历史画卷交迭着爱与恨的悲欢。
    40年如火如荼的社会主义建设，为九江这颗明珠拂去历史的尘埃，名山、名湖、名江、名洞、名城勃发生命的灵气和青春的活力。
    今天，这里已成为江西省粮棉重要产地，棉花产量占全省的2／3，油、苎麻、水产品产量均居全省前列；纺织、石油、化学、建材、船舶、电力工业实力雄厚，在江西省经济发展中举足轻重。全国最大的生产有机硅的星火化工厂，全国第一条年产300台冷藏集装箱的江西制氧机厂，全国第一批和江西省唯一的对外贸易港口，年加工原油250万吨的九江炼油厂，精梳毛纺织染整联合的江西毛纺厂，年产万吨化纤浆粕的九江化纤厂，全省第一座超高温高压机组的九江火力发电厂，全省最大的氯碱企业九江化工厂，闻名国内外的生产鸭鸭牌羽绒制品的共青垦殖场，以及一些军工企业，犹如群星荟萃九江大地。
    10年改革大潮，力促江西的领导决策层和九江的建设者们重新审视九江的优势，将发展的眼光跨越地域界限而投向长江开发带，并蕴育出新的战略构想：把九江作为建设重点，加速江西北部地区的开发建设。
    开放，开发，九江的经济建设由此跃入了更广阔的天地。21项江西省“七五”重点工程在九江布点，总投资26.4亿元，目前已有10项竣工。大沙铁路业已通车营运；国家投资改造的外贸码头已投入使用并正在为外轮通航作准备；万门程控电话和光缆通讯设施已投入使用；粘胶长丝、聚氯乙烯等原材料工业项目已竣工投产。世人瞩目的九江长江大桥公路桥可望明年底竣工；九江二电厂二期工程正在加紧施工；昌九一级公路、九江炼油厂年产30万吨合成氨及50万吨尿素等项工程正在作前期准备。这一切，加快了能源、交通、原材料工业的发展，为九江和江西的经济腾飞铺垫了坚实的基石。抓住这一机遇，江西省正在充分利用九江扼居我国东西部两个反向梯度开发要冲的优越地理位置和现有的经济基础，建设湘鄂赣皖四省毗邻地区的大市场，对外敞开大门，在长江大流域经济格局中壮大实力。
    九江，将以崛起的态势，迎接更美好的明天！
