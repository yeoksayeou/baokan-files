    The Inner Mongolia Yijin Qolo Banner has earnestly focused on anti-corruption efforts and achieved notable results. The extravagant use of public funds for feasting, which was strongly criticized by the public, has significantly decreased. Issues of party and government officials engaging in business and entrepreneurship have been rectified, and irregularities in recruitment, housing, and household registration have been controlled.

    Yijin Qolo Banner is the location of the mausoleum of Genghis Khan, the "Great Khan," and sees a high volume of visitors. In 1987, the banner hosted 120,000 visitors, with a single banquet costing over 4,000 yuan. The banner committee recognized that anti-corruption efforts must start from within, reducing the banquet and conference expenses of the banner committee and government by 70%. To date this year, the banner committee has not held any banquet, and the use of public funds for feasting across the banner has been effectively curbed.

    Yijin Qolo Banner emphasizes institutional building and public supervision in its anti-corruption efforts. In recent years, they have cleared 77 individuals with improper urban household registrations, revoked the admission or student status of 16 individuals with issues, and canceled the examination qualifications of 14 individuals. The former party secretary of Xinjie Town misappropriated public funds to engage in the illegal trade of wool and hired people to adulterate and falsify products. After the issue was investigated, the banner committee immediately removed him from his party position.

    注意完善制度　接受群众监督
    伊旗廉政建设抓得实收效大
    本报讯　内蒙古伊金霍洛旗认真抓廉政建设取得成效，群众反映强烈的用公款大吃大喝风明显收敛，党政机关干部经商办企业问题得到纠正，招工、住房、落户问题上的不正之风得到控制。
    伊旗是“一代天骄”成吉思汗陵寝所在地，人员往来频繁。1987年该旗接待12万人（次），有一次宴请花费就达4000余元。旗委认识到抓廉政建设必须从自身做起，压缩了旗委和政府70％的接待费和各种大型会议的经费。今年到目前为止，旗委未举行过招待宴会，全旗用公款吃喝风基本刹住。
    伊旗抓廉政，注重制度建设和群众的监督作用。近几年，他们清理不符合落城镇户口的77人，查出问题后取消录取资格或学籍的16人，取消报考资格的14人。原新街镇党委书记挪用公款倒贩绒毛，并雇人掺杂使假。问题查清后，旗委立即撤销了他的党内职务。
