    Strict Inspection to Ensure Quality: Expansion of Inspection Categories for Imported and Exported Goods

    BEIJING, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) — The State Bureau of Commodity Inspection today released a new list of categories, stipulating that 104 categories and 480 types of imported and exported goods must undergo mandatory inspection, otherwise they will not be allowed to pass through customs.

    Zhu Zhenyuan, Director of the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection, pointed out that currently, there are relatively serious quality issues with China's imported and exported goods. In 1988, nearly 20,000 batches of non-compliant goods were found among imported goods, with a value of $3.75 billion. The problems of adulteration, counterfeiting, and shortages in quantity and weight in exported goods also frequently occur, drawing strong reactions from abroad. In response to this situation, a new list of categories has been formulated and released.

    The new list includes 104 categories and 480 types of goods, with 40 categories and 148 types of imported goods, and 64 categories and 333 types of exported goods. Compared to the previous adjustments, the number of categories has increased by 22 categories and 80 types for imports, and by 22 categories and 26 types for exports, expanding by nearly 30%.

    The newly added categories mainly focus on goods related to human health and safety, bulk commodities, important goods related to national economy and people's livelihood, and goods that are prone to quality issues. Examples include complete sets of equipment, motor vehicles, electrical equipment, toys, cosmetics, traditional Chinese medicine, fireworks, and firecrackers.

    严格把关  确保质量
    进出口商品检验种类扩大
    本报北京八月四日讯　记者刘霄报道：国家商检局今天公布了新的《种类表》，规定一百零四类四百八十一种进出口商品必须实行法定检验，否则不能通关。
    国家商检局局长朱震元指出，当前我国进出口商品均存在比较严重的质量问题。一九八八年，在进口商品中查出近二万批不合格品，货值三十七点五亿美元。出口商品掺杂兑假、数量重量短少现象也不断发生，国外反映十分强烈。针对这种情况，特制定和公布了新的《种类表》。
    新《种类表》共包括一百零四类四百八十一种商品，其中进口商品四十类一百四十八种，出口商品六十四类三百三十三种，分别比调整前增加了二十二类八十种和二十二类二十六种，扩大近百分之三十。
    新增种类主要侧重于涉及人体安全卫生的商品、大宗商品、涉及国计民生的重要商品以及容易发生质量问题的商品。如成套设备、机动车辆、电工设备、玩具、化妆品、中药材、烟花鞭炮等。
