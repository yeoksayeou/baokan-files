In recent years, there has been a strong call from top to bottom to punish corruption, but because there has been more talk than action, some corrupt practices have not been effectively stopped. Those who advocate bourgeois liberalization have used this as a cover to confuse people and incite the masses to participate in turmoil and riots. The bloody lessons tell us that it is time to seriously tackle corruption. After the suppression of the riots, the Party Central Committee and the State Council decided to focus on the "seven key issues" that the masses are concerned about, which has been warmly supported by the entire Party and the people of the country. Our provincial party committee and government are determined to seize the current favorable opportunity, implement this decision, and seriously address the issue of corruption.

The main manifestations of corruption are greed and laziness. To combat corruption, we must treat the symptoms and apply remedies dialectically. The most important thing at present is to crack down on corruption, to investigate and deal with the problems of some party members and cadres, especially a few leading cadres, who use their power for personal gain, accept bribes, and engage in illegal trading, and to promote clean governance. At the same time, we must seriously address the problems of difficult procedures, poor service, low efficiency, and serious bureaucratism in party and government agencies, to promote diligent governance.

The key to doing well in clean governance and hard work lies in leadership. First of all, we must require all levels of leadership to have a high degree of self-awareness, to be strict with themselves, and to set an example. Only in this way can we gain effective speaking rights and true leadership, and have the power to mobilize the masses. Take our province's crackdown on extravagant banquets as an example. We have clearly stipulated that party and government officials going to the grassroots must eat simple meals and strictly prohibit smoking and alcohol receptions. Because the responsible comrades of the provincial party committee and government lead by example in observing this regulation, the extravagant banquet culture has been significantly curbed. Now, high-end food like soft-shelled turtles and high-end cigarettes and alcohol are in oversupply, and the people say this is related to the crackdown on extravagant banquets, which is quite reasonable. Practice has proven that whether leading cadres can be strict with themselves and set an example is crucial to doing well in clean governance and hard work. Of course, as leading cadres, it is not enough to be content with personal integrity. We must, while managing ourselves and our families, seriously promote clean governance and diligent governance in the places, departments, and units for which we are responsible, and earnestly improve the small environment to promote the improvement of the overall environment. In this regard, on the one hand, we rely on the self-awareness of leaders at all levels, and on the other hand, we welcome supervision from all quarters and the media.

To achieve both clean governance and diligent governance, leading comrades must be selfless and fearless. Whether it is cracking down on corruption or addressing laziness, it will inevitably touch the vested interests of some people, including our own. Therefore, solving these problems often faces great resistance and many interferences. Especially when it involves some leading cadres and touches upon some "networks," it is even more difficult to investigate and handle. If we leading cadres have personal motives, fear of inviting trouble, and fear of offending people, then we will not be able to solve the problem of corruption. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must strengthen their political learning, especially to deeply study the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the series of important instructions by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, enhance their party spirit, eliminate杂念, and firmly establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. At the same time, we must seriously study and formulate some solid measures to encourage the broad masses of cadres and the people to actively fight against corrupt practices. In this regard, we must have clear rewards and punishments. Those who dare to take action, dare to manage, and dare to tackle hard problems in the fight against corruption should be commended; those who are not upright themselves and fear "pulling out the radish with the mud" and those who always act out of personal motives should be criticized and educated; those who do not change after education should be firmly removed from their leadership positions, and those who are derelict of duty should be held accountable.

To do well in clean governance and hard work, we must also emphasize two-pronged approach, one hand to prevent, one hand to treat, and closely combine prevention with treatment. In the long run, prevention is more important than treatment. At present, the people have many complaints about corruption, and treatment is the first priority. From the situation in our province, there are currently two phenomena that seriously hinder the deepening of the fight against corruption: one is the phenomenon of intercession, and the other is the retaliation against informants. According to the letters and visits department, in recent periods, the problem of retaliation against informants has begun to increase, and with the deepening of the fight against corruption, this problem may become more prominent. In this regard, we will select some typical cases, handle them publicly, and severely punish those with serious offenses according to law, to deter the bad elements and educate the cadres and the masses. Of course, we must also prevent those with ulterior motives from taking private revenge and falsely accusing good people. While fighting corruption, we must strengthen education and institutional building to improve the political quality of the broad masses of cadres and eliminate the breeding ground for corruption. We are confident that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, leading cadres at all levels will set an example, be selfless and fearless, and insist on a two-pronged approach, and the article on clean governance and hard work can be well written.

    做好廉政勤政这篇文章
    中共安徽省委书记　卢荣景　安徽省省长　傅锡寿
    近几年来，上上下下关于惩治腐败的呼声非常强烈，但由于说得多，做得少，致使一些腐败现象得不到有效的制止。那些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，正是以此为陪衬，蛊惑人心，煽动群众卷入动乱和暴乱。血的教训告诉我们，惩治腐败到了非抓不可的时候了。平暴之后，党中央、国务院决定近期要做群众关心的“七件事”，得到全党和全国人民的衷心拥护。我们省委、省政府决心抓紧当前有利时机，贯彻好这个决定，认真解决腐败问题。
    腐败问题的主要表现，一是贪，二是惰。惩治腐败，应对症下药，辩证施治。眼下最重要的是肃贪，把某些党员干部特别是极少数领导干部以权谋私、贪污受贿、倒买倒卖之类的问题查清，依据法纪严肃处理，以推进廉政建设。同时，认真治治党政机关存在的办事难、服务差、效率低、官僚主义严重等问题，以搞好勤政建设。
    做好廉政勤政这篇文章，关键在领导。首先要求我们各级领导要有高度的自觉性，严于律己，率先垂范。只有这样，我们才能赢得有效的发言权和真正的领导权，才有号召群众的力量。就拿我省刹吃喝风来说，我们明确规定，党政机关干部下基层，一律吃份饭，严禁烟酒招待。由于省委、省政府负责同志带头遵守这个制度，吃喝风现已大为收敛。现在市场上甲鱼等高档食品跌价，名烟名酒滞销，群众说这与刹吃喝风有关，这是不无道理的。实践证明，领导干部能否严于律己，以身作则，对于做好廉政勤政这篇文章是至关重要的。当然，作为领导干部，满足于洁身自好是不够的，必须在管好自己和自己家庭的同时，切实抓好自己负责的地方、部门和单位的廉政和勤政建设，认真治理好小气候，促进大环境的改善。在这个问题上，一方面要靠我们各级领导者的自觉性，另一方面要求教于各方人士，欢迎舆论监督。
    要做到既廉政又勤政，领导同志必须无私无畏。无论是肃贪还是治惰，都必然会触动一些人乃至自身的既得利益。因此，解决这类问题，往往阻力很大，干扰很多。特别是那些涉及到某些领导干部、牵连到一些“关系网”的时候，更是难查、难办。如果我们领导干部存有私心，怕引火烧身，怕得罪人，那就无法解决腐败问题。所以，各级领导都要加强自身政治学习，特别是要深入学习十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志一系列重要指示，增强党性，消除杂念，牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。同时，要认真研究制定一些过硬的措施，鼓励广大干部群众积极与腐败现象作斗争。在这个问题上要奖惩分明。对那些敢抓敢管，敢于碰硬，在惩治腐败方面成绩突出的干部，要大力表彰；对那些自身不正，怕“拔出萝卜带出泥”的干部和一贯私心作祟的“和事佬”，要进行批评教育；经教育不改的，要坚决调离领导岗位，对失职渎职的应追究责任。
    要做好廉政勤政这篇文章，也要强调两手抓，一手抓防，一手抓治，把防与治紧密地结合起来。就长远来说，防重于治。当前，人民群众对腐败问题意见多，治是第一位的。从我省的情况看，目前有两种现象严重妨碍惩治腐败斗争的深入，一是说情风，一是对举报人打击报复。据信访部门反映，最近一个时期，对举报人打击报复的问题开始多了起来，随着惩治腐败斗争的深入，这个问题可能进一步突出。对此，我们将选择一些典型，公开处理，依法严惩情节恶劣的，以震慑坏人，教育干部群众。当然也要防止那些心术不正的人挟私报复、诬陷好人。在惩腐的同时，要加强教育和制度建设，以提高广大干部的政治素质，铲除滋生腐败的温床。我们深信，在党中央、国务院的正确领导下，各级干部以身作则，无私无畏，坚持两手抓，廉政勤政这篇文章是能够做好的。
