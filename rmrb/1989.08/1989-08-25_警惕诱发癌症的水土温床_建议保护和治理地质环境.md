Every year, at least 5 million people worldwide die from cancer. Numerous studies have shown that certain adverse water and soil environments act as "breeding grounds" for cancer, and this environment is not solely a product of nature but is largely created by human activities.

According to a survey in the United States involving 655,000 cancer patients, 90% of cancer cases were induced by chemical factors. Animal experiments have confirmed that over 1,100 chemical substances can induce tumors, including well-known substances like aflatoxin, as well as naphthylamine, nitrites, and compounds of arsenic, chromium, nickel, and vanadium. These chemicals come from both natural sources and increasing human pollution, accumulating in certain water and soil environments and leading to regional high incidences of cancer.

The regions with the highest incidence of primary liver cancer are in West and South Africa, the western Pacific coast, and Southeast Asia. In China, the average liver cancer mortality rate is 10 per 100,000 people, with high-incidence areas mainly in the coastal regions of Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Hanjiang estuary, where the mortality rate reaches 40-50 per 100,000 people. The water and soil environments in these high-incidence areas are characterized by a warm and humid climate, abundant rainfall, and low-lying terrain. These areas have a late geological formation history, frequent marine incursions, and are primarily composed of marine, alluvial, and lacustrine clay and fine sand. Surface and groundwater are abundant but poorly drained. Industrial waste discharge is high, leading to severe pollution. The soil organic matter content is generally above 1%. Residents often drink water from ponds, ditches, and rivers. Sanitation conditions are poor, with many water sources being turbid and containing large amounts of microorganisms, humic substances, and various odors. Mercury, chromium, arsenic, phenol, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, and nitrite levels are severely exceeded. A survey in Qidong, Jiangsu, found that liver cancer mortality is closely related to the quality of drinking water sources: ponds and ditch water with high humic acid and nitrite levels (greater than 0.4 ppm) have a mortality rate of 96.5 per 100,000 people; well water with humic acid and nitrite levels between 0.05-0.20 ppm has a mortality rate of around 10 per 100,000 people.

Esophageal cancer is prevalent in Central and Southern Africa and Central Asia, with the most severe cases in the Caspian Sea region of Iran and the Turkmen region of the former Soviet Union. In China, the average esophageal cancer mortality rate is 11 per 100,000 people, with high-incidence areas in the Taihang Mountains, Northern Jiangsu, Western Sichuan, and Central Guangdong, particularly in the Qingjiang River basin of Henan and Hebei, where the mortality rate exceeds 100 per 100,000 people. The average stomach cancer mortality rate in China is 15 per 100,000 people, with high-incidence areas in the Loess Plateau of Northwest China and parts of the low mountains and hills along the Southeast coast. Although the water and soil environments in these high-incidence areas vary greatly, they share some common features: the terrain is mainly mountainous, followed by hilly, with local terrain often being valleys or basins within mountains and hills; the water and soil have low salt content, with low levels of calcium, magnesium, selenium, fluorine, iodine, molybdenum, copper, zinc, and cobalt, but high levels of nitrosamines, humic acids, and individual trace elements like lead and zinc; drinking water sanitation is poor, and pollution is severe. A comparative survey in Linxian, Shexian, Shizhong, and Wu'an found that esophageal cancer mortality is closely related to the pollution level of living water sources: cave water with nitrite levels of 0.187 ppm and humic acid levels of 0.60 ppm has a mortality rate of 253 per 100,000 people; pond, ditch, and river water with nitrite levels of 0.047-0.096 ppm and humic acid levels of 0.30 ppm has a mortality rate of 126 per 100,000 people; well and spring water with nitrite levels below 0.01 ppm and humic acid levels below 0.23 ppm has a mortality rate of 39 per 100,000 people.

In contrast, China and other parts of the world have many "longevity zones" where cancer and other chronic diseases are rare. These areas typically have clean water, lush forests, and a tranquil, elegant environment. The water and soil contain appropriate levels of various macro and micro elements such as calcium, magnesium, lithium, manganese, vanadium, molybdenum, and silicon. The water hardness and acidity are moderate, and surface and groundwater flow conditions are good, with strong purification capabilities and minimal or no pollution.

The chemical factors that stimulate and induce cancer and the resulting geological and natural environments are extremely complex. Current understanding is still very limited, but these clues tell us: for humanity to develop healthily for generations to come, in addition to choosing favorable environments, it is crucial to protect and manage our own environments. I recommend that relevant national departments conduct in-depth research on geological and natural environments, carry out work to protect and manage geological environments, and address the important aspect of conquering cancer and other endemic diseases.

    警惕诱发癌症的水土温床  建议保护和治理地质环境
    张业成
    全世界每年至少有500万人死于癌症。许多事实证明，某些不良的水土环境是诱发癌症的“温床”，而这个“温床”不光是大自然的产物，在很大程度上是由人类自己造成的。
    据美国一次对65.5万例癌症患者调查，因化学因素刺激和诱发癌症的占90％。通过动物实验，目前已证实1100多种化学物质可以诱发形成肿瘤，其中除已广为人知的黄曲霉素等外，还有萘胺、亚硝酸盐及砷、铬、镍、钒等化合物。这些化学物质一方面来自大自然，另一方面来自日益增多的人为污染源，它们在一定的水土环境中富集，导致某些癌症的地区性高发现象。
    世界上原发肝癌的高发区在非洲西部、南部，太平洋西岸和东南亚地区。我国肝癌平均死亡率10／10万，高发区主要在苏、沪、浙、闽、粤等滨海地区，以长江三角洲、珠江三角洲、韩江口等地最突出，死亡率达40—50／10万。肝癌高发区的水土环境是：气候温湿，降雨充沛，地势低平；成陆时间晚，频繁遭受海侵，主要沉积物为海积、冲积、湖积粘性土和粉细砂；地表水、地下水丰富，但径流不畅；三废排放量大，污染严重，土壤中有机质含量一般大于1％；居民饮用水多为宅塘水、沟浜水、河水；卫生条件差，多数水源浑浊不清，有大量微生物、腐植质，有不同程度的异味、异嗅，汞、铬、砷、酚、氨氮、硝酸根、亚硝酸根等严重超标。据江苏启东地区调查，肝癌死亡率与具有不同水质的饮用水源密切相关：宅塘水、沟浜水腐质酸和亚硝酸根含量均大于0.4ppm，死亡率96.5／10万；井水腐质酸和亚硝酸根含量0.05—0.20ppm，死亡率10／10万左右。
    食管癌多发区在中南非及中亚地带，伊朗的里海沿岸和苏联的土库曼地区最严重。我国食管癌平均死亡率为11／10万，高发区在太行山及苏北、川北、粤中等地，以冀豫交界的清漳河流域最严重，死亡率超过100／10万。我国胃癌平均死亡率为15／10万，高发区在西北黄土高原和东南沿海的部分低山、丘陵地区。这些高发区的水土环境虽然千差万别，但存在一些共同特点：地貌条件主要为山区，其次为丘陵，局部地貌多为山丘中的谷地或盆地；水土含盐量均比较低，钙、镁、硒、氟、碘、钼、铜、锌、钴等元素含量少，但亚硝胺、腐植酸及铅、锌等个别微量元素含量却比较高；饮用水卫生条件差，污染严重。据林县、涉县、磁县、武安等地的对比调查，食管癌死亡率与生活水源的污染程度关系密切；旱窖水亚硝酸根0.187ppm，腐植酸0.60ppm，死亡率253／10万；沟塘水、渠水、河水亚硝酸根0.047—0.096ppm，腐植酸0.30ppm，死亡率126／10万；井水、泉水亚硝酸根小于0.01ppm，腐植酸小于0.23ppm，死亡率39／10万。
    与上述环境相反，我国和世界上有不少“长寿区”，那里癌症及其它顽症绝少，其水土环境大多水净林清，安静优雅，水土中钙、镁、锂、锰、钒、钼、硅等各种常量和微量元素适度，硬度、酸度适中，地表水、地下水径流条件好，净化能力强，没有或基本没有污染。
    刺激诱发癌症的化学因素及其产生的地质—自然环境是极其复杂的，目前取得的认识还非常有限，但这些蛛丝马迹告诉我们：人类要世世代代健康地发展，除了选择有利的环境处所外，最重要的是保护和治理好自身的环境。我建议，国家有关部要深入进行地质—自然环境研究，开展保护和治理地质环境的工作，抓好征服癌症及其它地方病的重要一环。
