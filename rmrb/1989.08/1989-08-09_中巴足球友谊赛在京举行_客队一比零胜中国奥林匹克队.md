A friendly football match between China and Brazil, organized for the visiting Santos Football Club from Brazil, was held tonight at the Xiannongtan Stadium in Beijing. The visiting team won with a score of 1:0 against the Chinese Olympic team.

Beijing's football field has not seen so many spectators in a long time. The reason why tonight's match attracted more than 20,000 fans is that Santos is one of the most skilled visiting teams in recent years. The team is a typical example of Brazilian style, with players having excellent flexibility and skilled footwork.

What excited the fans even more was that tonight they not only enjoyed the flavor of Brazilian "artistic" football but also saw a new generation of young Chinese football players. Coach Xu Genbao of the Chinese Olympic team had made up his mind before the match: to learn from the strong team, one must insist on playing to one's own strengths. Indeed, the home team started the match with quick passes and defensive pressure, making the game lively and preventing the Brazilian players from playing as leisurely as they did against the Tianjin team the other day. In the first half, both teams had almost equal attacking opportunities, with a similar number of shots on goal. In the second half, the home team, which was technically inferior, began to tire and slowed down in their counterattacks. Although number 5 Li Hongbing closely marked Socrates, the defense line still could not withstand the opponent's repeated attacks. At the 19th minute, Brazil's number 10 Sosa took advantage of a mistake by the home team's central defender and scored a header in an unmarked situation. Goalkeeper Fu Yubin, who had saved several dangerous balls, did not lose heart, but coach Li Songhai sighed on the sidelines: "What a pity!"

After the match, Chinese team coach Xu Genbao expressed satisfaction with the team's effort to play at speed, but also noted the lack of attacking support points.

Reporters covering the match also voted for Brazil's number 10 Sosa as the best player, number 8 Socrates as the best in appearance, China's number 20 Fu Yubin as the best goalkeeper, and number 6 Gao Hongbo as the bravest player.

    中巴足球友谊赛在京举行
    客队一比零胜中国奥林匹克队
    本报北京8月9日讯　记者汪大昭、缪鲁报道：为巴西桑托斯俱乐部队访华而举办的中信杯中巴足球友谊比赛，今晚在北京先农坛体育场进行，客队以1∶0战胜中国奥林匹克队。
    北京的足球赛场已经好久没有这么多观众了，今晚的比赛之所以吸引了两万余名球迷，一个重要原因在于桑托斯确为近年来华的客队中技艺最高的一支。该队是典型的巴西风格，队员身体柔韧性极好，脚下功夫娴熟。
    更令球迷们兴奋的是今晚不仅欣赏到巴西“艺术”足球的韵味，而且看到了年轻气盛的中国足坛一茬新人。中国奥林匹克队教练徐根宝赛前主意已定，要向强手学习，就要坚持打自己的特点。果然，主队在比赛一开始就以快速转移和封堵，把场面活跃起来，致使巴西球员无法再如日前对付天津队那样慢条斯理地玩球。上半时，双方竟打得攻势相当，射门次数所差无几。到了下半时，技艺差了一截的主队体力下降，反击速度减慢。5号李红兵虽然盯死了苏格拉底，但是后卫线还是经不住对方反复扯动。到第19分钟，巴西队10号索萨抓住主队中卫的疏忽，在无人盯防的良机中头球破门。几次救出险球的门将傅玉斌并不泄气，倒是教练李松海在场外连叹：“可惜！”
    中国队教练徐根宝赛后对队员们努力打出速度表示满意，也看到进攻接应点不足的问题。
    采访比赛的记者们还投票评选巴西队10号索萨为最佳球员，8号苏格拉底为最佳仪表奖，中国队20号傅玉斌为最佳门将，6号高洪波为敢斗奖。
