It is said that some young people today are unwilling to pursue scholarship, especially the study of traditional Chinese scholarship. It is true that traditional scholarship cannot modernize China. Pure scholarship neither brings profit nor fame, and it is natural to see peers entering officialdom, becoming section chiefs today and ministers tomorrow, or engaging in business, feasting on fine food and wine, and earning large sums of money. It is also understandable that, like Hua Xun, they can no longer sit on the cold bench. Moreover, with the experience of their parents over forty years, they know that scholars are politically ineffective and economically unproductive, and that failure and misfortune are inevitable outcomes. This example is very powerful. So, does this mean that scholarship will disappear?

No, it will not. Scholarship has always been the pursuit of a few. Even if the majority of people are indifferent, the torch of scholarship will be passed on, and there will always be those who guard their scholarly positions. They do this because they cannot do otherwise. They cannot resist their own thoughts and nature. The pursuit of scholarship itself is their purpose, and it is the reason for their existence in this world. Such people will not be many, nor do they need to be many. In the realm of scholarship, we should not emphasize "quantity."

"The necessity of referring to Greece" was originally a correct criticism of dogmatism, but unfortunately, it has been misinterpreted by some. I believe that at least the scholarly spirit of the ancient Greeks is admirable. Their fundamental attitude is to transcend gains and losses. In the words of our ancestors, it can also be called "understanding the way without calculating the results." There is a famous story: A student of Euclid asked in class, "Teacher, what benefits will I gain from learning these things?" Euclid did not answer him but turned to his attendant and said, "Give him two coins."

Professor Jowett of England wrote in his lectures on "The Greek Spirit of Learning":
The Greeks dared to ask why. This was not enough; they wanted to find the reason behind the facts. Their answers to why were often wrong, but they had no hesitation or fear, and no priestly authority stopped them from venturing into the hidden regions of causes. There is a fact known to the builders of ancient China, India, and Egypt: if a triangle has sides represented by the numbers three, four, and five, then the sides three and four are perpendicular to each other. Centuries passed without anyone asking why this is so. In a dialogue written by a Chinese emperor around the year 1100, the interlocutor demonstrated this famous property of the triangle, and the emperor said: Indeed, wonderful! But he did not think of asking for the reason. This wonder is the origin of philosophy, but sometimes it stops philosophy. It was not until the Greeks appeared in history that they asked for the reason and gave the answer.... The geometry discovered by the Greeks can represent the idealistic temperament, which is very obvious in Greek art and literature. A line with length but no width, absolutely straight or curved, indicates that we are in the realm of pure thought.

Generally, those who are not swayed by wealth, not moved by poverty, not bent by force, and who diligently guard their scholarly positions throughout their lives, must possess the idealistic temperament mentioned by Jowett, and their talents and knowledge are secondary. They explore and pursue in the realm of "pure thought," enjoying their hardships and joys, and enjoying freedoms that cannot be found elsewhere.

The trigrams are the original symbols of the Book of Changes, and the principles of the Book of Changes are later interpretations by Confucian scholars; while the trigrams later evolved from divination, omens, and prophecies into medicine, alchemy, sexual practices, geomancy, and astrology, even the old signs for fortune-telling and calculating the eight characters write "Expert in the Great Philosopher of the Book of Changes," which is absurd. But in any case, all of this is Chinese culture, a mixture of the essence and dregs of traditional Chinese culture, with rich content, all of which is worth deep analysis and study.

Traditional scholarship cannot modernize China, and reading the "Chu Ci" cannot cultivate a modern spirit, but if we approach traditional culture with a transcendental attitude and modern thoughts and methods, layer by layer, we can uncover the roots of the things flowing in the veins of this ancient nation, which is a necessary step for China's modernization. Ballber is starting to do this, and as a hopeful modernizer of China, I am very happy.

    学问与理想
    钟叔河
    据说现在有的青年人不愿做学问，尤其是不愿研究中国的传统学问了。本来，传统学问不能使中国现代化，这个观点不能说不对。纯粹学问既不能射利又难以沽名，眼见同学少年或入选当官，今天为处长，明天为部长，或经商跑广，大碗吃酒肉，大把分现金，像华歆那样再也坐不住冷板凳，也是人之常情。更何况积父辈四十年之经验，深知书呆子政治上不会跟，经济上搞不活，倒霉加倒挂都是必然的结局，这个榜样的力量也是大得很的。那么，难道学问真的就会绝灭了么？
    不，决不。学问从来就是少数人的事业，纵然滔滔者天下皆是也，薪尽火传，不绝如缕，总还会有人坚守他做学问的阵地的。他这样做，是因为他不能不这样做。他无法违抗自己的思想和天性，做学问这件事本身就是他这样做的目的，也就是他在这个世界上活着的目的。这样的人不会多，也用不着多。在学问领域里，不能仅仅强调“人多”。
    “言必称希腊”本来是批评教条主义的正确的话，可惜以后被有的人曲解了。我认为，至少古希腊人为学的精神是值得钦佩的，那种精神的根本态度就是超越利害，用我们老祖宗的话来说，也可以叫做“明其道不计其功”罢。有一个有名的故事：欧几里德的一名学生在课堂上发问，“老师，你给我讲的这些，学了能够得到什么利益么？”欧老先生没有回答他，却回头叫自己的跟班：“去拿两个钱来给他罢。”
    英国部丘教授在《希腊的好学》的讲义中写道：
    希腊人敢于发为什么的疑问。那事实还是不够，他们要找出事实后面的原因。对于为什么，他们的答案常是错误，但没有忧虑踌躇，没有牧师的威权去阻止他们冒险深入原因的隐秘区域里去。有一件事是古代的中国印度埃及的建筑家都知道的，即假如有一个三角，其各边如以数字表之为三与四与五，则其三与四的两边当互为垂直。几个世纪都过去了，未见有人发这问题：为什么如此？在基督约千一百年前中国一个皇帝所写的一篇对话里，那对话人曾举示他这有名的三角特性，皇帝说：真的，奇哉！但他并不想到去追问其理由。这惊奇是哲学所从生，有时却止住了哲学。直到希腊人在历史上出来，才问这理由，给这答案。……希腊人所发现的那种几何很可表示那理想家气质，这在希腊美术文艺上都极明显易见的。有长无广的线，绝对的直或是曲的线，这就指示出来，我们是在纯粹思想的界内了。
    大凡富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈，孜孜矻矻，毕生坚守做学问的阵地的人，必具有部丘所谓理想家的气质，而其才与学识尚在其次。他在“纯粹思想的界内”探索追求，享受着他的苦和乐，享受着此外无从享受的自由。
    象数是易的本原，易理则是后来儒家引申傅会出来的；而象数后来也从占卜、灾祥、谶纬衍为医术、丹道、房中、堪舆、星相，连旧时看相算八字的市招也写上“精研周易大哲学家”就显得荒唐了。但无论如何，这一切都是中国的文化，是中国传统文化的积淀精华与糟粕杂糅，有丰富的内涵，都值得作精深的驳析研究。
    传统学问固不能使中国现代化，熟读离骚培养不出现代精神来，但如能以超越利害的态度，以现代的思想和方法，来一层一层掘开传统文化的积淀，找出我们这个古老民族血管里流动着的东西的根源，却是中国现代化非跨越不可的一步。球柏君在开始这样做，作为一个中国现代化的企望者，我是十分高兴的。
