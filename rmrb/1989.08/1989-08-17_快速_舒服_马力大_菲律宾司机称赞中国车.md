Xinhua News Agency, Manila, August 17th.

Filipino drivers have praised the 20 "Fengshen" buses imported from China, highlighting their powerful engines, high speed, and comfortable ride.

The *Manila Bulletin* reported on the 16th that experienced drivers from the Manila Transport Company found that although the "Fengshen" buses have smaller engines compared to their Japanese-made counterparts, the Chinese buses have more pulling power and are easier to operate. Additionally, the Chinese buses are more fuel-efficient, with a fuel consumption rate of 2.3 kilometers per liter, compared to an average of 1.8 kilometers per liter for other similar vehicles.

On the 15th, Philippine Transportation Secretary Renelario Reyes inspected the Chinese buses. He noted that the "Fengshen" buses come with a warranty covering 80,000 kilometers per year, whereas similar products typically offer only a half-year warranty for 20,000 kilometers. Furthermore, the spare parts for these buses are expected to arrive soon.

It is reported that 18 Chinese technicians have arrived in Manila to handle after-sales service for the "Fengshen" buses and to assist in training Filipino technicians.

These 20 buses are the first batch of 305 buses ordered by Philippine state-owned and private automobile companies from China, which arrived in July. The remaining over 200 buses are expected to be delivered by the end of this year.

    快速　舒服　马力大
    菲律宾司机称赞中国车
    新华社马尼拉8月17日电  菲律宾汽车司机称赞从中国进口的20辆“风神”公共汽车马力大、速度快、乘坐舒服。
    《马尼拉公报》16日报道说，马尼拉运输公司经验丰富的司机们认为：虽然“风神”车的引擎和他们驾驶的日本造公共汽车比起来小些，但是中国汽车拉力大些而且操作起来比较容易。除此，中国汽车比较经济，消耗一公升汽油可行驶2.3公里，而其它同类汽车耗油一公升的平均行程只有1.8公里。
    菲律宾交通运输部长雷内里奥·雷耶斯15日参观了中国汽车。他说，“风神”车还提供每年行驶8万公里的保单，而同类产品一般只有半年2万公里的保单。此外，这些汽车的零配件不久也将运抵。
    据悉，18名中国技术员已到马尼拉，负责“风神”车售后服务，以及帮助培训菲技术人员。
    这20辆汽车是菲国营和私营汽车公司向中国定购的305辆汽车的首批，7月份运抵，其余的200多辆预计到今年12月将全部交货。
