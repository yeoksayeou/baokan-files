    Guizhou is taking strong measures to curb the trend of illegal land occupation for housing construction. At a press conference held today by the Guizhou Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Governor Wang Chao Wen emphasized that cleaning up the illegal construction of private homes by officials and staff of state organs must be treated as a major task in the current campaign for clean governance and anti-corruption. He stressed that no matter who is involved, the issue must be investigated to the end and dealt with seriously.

    Statistics show that over the past few years, there have been more than 13,000 cases of illegal land occupation for housing construction in Guizhou, involving over 3,900 acres of land. The province's focus is on cleaning up party and government officials at the county level and above.
