    Wu Xueqian Meets Lao Guests
    Kaysone Phomvihane to Visit China

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 15 (Reporter Jiang Lurong) — Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Wu Xueqian met with Lao guests today and expressed his delight and congratulations on the consensus reached by both sides on restoring party relations through talks.

    This afternoon, Wu Xueqian met with the delegation led by Thongsavanh Keokanphet, First Deputy Foreign Minister and First Deputy Head of the External Relations Department of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, at the Zhongnanhai Purple Light Pavilion. He welcomed their visit.

    Wu Xueqian said that at the invitation of Premier Li Peng, Kaysone Phomvihane, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, will soon pay an official friendly visit to China. This is a major event in the relations between the two countries.

    He said that the Chinese side attaches great importance to Kaysone's visit and is willing to work with Lao comrades to prepare for the visit to ensure its success. He expressed his belief that this visit will push the friendship between the two countries to a new stage.

    Thongsavanh expressed satisfaction with the results of the visit. He said that the Lao side always remembers the kindness of the Chinese side in assisting Laos.

    When discussing bilateral relations, Wu Xueqian said that Laos is China's neighbor, and the two countries have close relations.

    He believed that although there had been some difficulties in the past, they are now in the past. China advocates that countries, regardless of size or wealth, should support and help each other. We have always believed that relations between countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, seeking common development on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    Thongsavanh asked Wu Xueqian to convey greetings from Kaysone and other Lao party and government leaders to the Chinese leaders, especially Kaysone's warm greetings and respect to Chairman Deng Xiaoping.
