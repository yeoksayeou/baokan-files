Some individuals who claim to be "intellectual elites" are actually the dregs of Chinese intellectuals. In the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, they played the roles of planners, instigators, organizers, and commanders. Yan Jiaqi is one of the main representatives of these individuals.

(1)

In the eyes of some who are not fully aware of the facts, Yan Jiaqi is considered an "academic elite." In reality, ten years ago, he was a person with political ambitions who was eager to engage in street politics and illegal activities. At that time, he was busy maintaining close ties with illegal organizations in Beijing and other places such as "Enlightenment Society," "Revitalization Society," and illegal publications like "April Fifth News," as well as their leaders. He attended meetings, provided strategies, and offered financial support. He also directly participated in activities under the "Xidan Wall," becoming an active advocate for Western "democracy" and "freedom." It was from here that he began his political career.

After the "Xidan Wall" and illegal organizations were disbanded, Yan Jiaqi turned to "studying" political science. His "research" results mainly included three books: one was a collection of big and small character posters and various rumors and hearsay titled "A Decade of the Cultural Revolution," another was "Theory of Leadership," which promoted bourgeois political views, and the third was a self-promoting autobiography titled "Intellectual Autobiography." His basic political views advocated for China to implement a "separation of powers" and "checks and balances" without the leadership of the Communist Party. He believed that Marxism is a "closed thought system," and defending the purity of Marxism is equivalent to defending "Chinese feudal culture." In summary, he aimed to abolish the Four Cardinal Principles and promote American-style bourgeois democracy in China. He collaborated closely with those who stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois liberalization stance, mutually supporting each other, and became an important representative figure. For this reason, he was hailed by some domestic and overseas individuals as a "new type of political scientist," "political elite," "authority on political system reform theory," "democracy fighter," "representative of liberal intellectuals," and "contemporary world figure," among others, gaining fame for a time. He frequently "visited" some Western countries and was favored by certain Western political leaders, willingly serving as a spokesperson for Western bourgeoisie in China. It is no surprise that he was noticed by Zhao Ziyang and Bao Tong. In the fall of 1986, they transferred Yan Jiaqi to the Central Political System Reform Research Office to hold an important position. Bao Tong even called the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to ensure that Yan Jiaqi's position as the director of the Institute of Political Science was retained and that a car was provided for his activities. From then on, Yan Jiaqi became an important member of the so-called Zhao Ziyang's brain trust.

In early 1987, after the campaign against bourgeois liberalization began, Yan Jiaqi was investigated by relevant departments. However, Yan Jiaqi immediately sought help from Bao Tong, writing him a letter to defend his errors. On March 20, Bao Tong wrote a report to Zhao Ziyang on behalf of the Central Political System Reform Research Office, stating that the errors attributed to Yan Jiaqi during the investigation were "misunderstandings" and "misinformation," praising Yan Jiaqi as "disciplined," and requesting that he continue to work in the Political System Reform Research Office. Zhao Ziyang immediately agreed and instructed relevant responsible comrades to "take note." Thus, Yan Jiaqi was protected.

After the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, facing strong criticism within and outside the Party, Zhao Ziyang not only did not reflect on his mistakes but also passively responded to the central government's rectification and rectification policies. After this, some individuals within the so-called brain trust revealed that they wanted to stir up a "topple Deng, protect Zhao" wind, and some overseas reactionary newspapers exposed that only if "Deng Xiaoping completely retired" and Zhao Ziyang "dictated reform," would China have hope.

This was a political signal. Yan Jiaqi, a person connected to Bao Tong on one side and overseas and foreign anti-communist and anti-China forces on the other, was the most notable figure in the "topple Deng, protect Zhao" wind. His most prominent action was to publish "Dialogue on the Situation" with Wen Yuanke. This dialogue was compiled by a reporter from the "Economic Weekly," which was very active during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, and was almost simultaneously published in the "Economic Weekly" and some Hong Kong newspapers. The "World Economic Herald" also published similar content. The essence of the dialogue can be summarized as "topple Deng, protect Zhao." In their words, the central government's rectification and rectification policies were a "retreat," and the criticism of Zhao Ziyang's errors within and outside the Party posed a "danger" of "squandering the achievements of reform." If Zhao Ziyang stepped down, China's social and economic development would face "stagnation." Therefore, they opposed "non-procedural power transfers." The three words "non-procedural" were carefully chosen and deserve special attention. This was no longer about academic discussions but a naked political mobilization.

At the same time, he promoted a set of so-called "procedures." In November of the previous year, he published a speech in the "World Economic Herald," urging people to abandon the struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and resist spiritual pollution. He attributed the root cause of corruption to public ownership and demanded the "active development of private ownership." Starting from the history of the Soviet Communist Party, he proposed to "dissolve the Politburo" and establish a so-called Washington-style procedure. In February of this year, he again proposed in Japan that the "Central Committee of the Communist Party must be abolished." In summary, he pursued and advocated for the Western political system of abolishing the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party. He also published a speech in a certain youth magazine's second issue, advocating for amending the Constitution of our country according to his set of "procedures," specifying how the state power is composed and who should hold the state power. If his set of "procedures" is not followed? He said, "Then there is only the way of non-procedural expression, such as resorting to violence or turmoil!" Note that Yan Jiaqi has moved from opposing "non-procedural" to inciting non-procedural actions. His activities, along with Fang Lizhi's "New Enlightenment Salon," Chen Jun's signed petitions, Guo Yan's speeches, Li Shuxian and Wang Dan's organized gatherings, and the big and small character posters directly attacking the Party and the socialist system in some universities in Beijing, directly prepared the public opinion and organization for the turmoil.

After the death of Hu Yaobang on April 15, a few individuals immediately took the opportunity to use the student movement to create turmoil. Political slogans appeared in large numbers during the marches, sit-ins, and attacks on Xinhua Gate, with the two most core slogans being to "rehabilitate" Hu Yaobang and completely negate the opposition to bourgeois liberalization. Yan Jiaqi seized these two points to provide strategies and incite actions.

On April 19, the "World Economic Herald" and "New Outlook" held a meeting in Beijing, inviting some individuals to discuss, with many people directing their attacks at the central government. Yan Jiaqi spoke, saying, "Just by looking at Tiananmen Square, one can see that it is only about giving a fair evaluation to Yaobang and about giving a fair evaluation to certain movements in 1986. On Tiananmen Square, I saw the future and hope of China." He not only summarized the two substantive slogans, making them the action guidelines for the initial stage of the turmoil, but also directly cheered for the illegal march, fanning the flames of the turmoil.

On April 21, under the instructions of Bao Tong, he and Bao Zhenxin posted an "Open Letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council," demanding that the central government acknowledge that the demands raised during the marches and sit-ins were "active" and "democratic demands," exerting pressure on the central government. Bao Zhenxin later told a reporter from the Hong Kong magazine "Citizens" that this letter "greatly encouraged the students."

After the important editorial in the People's Daily on April 26, the Shanghai Municipal Committee made a decision to rectify the "World Economic Herald" in accordance with the central government's spirit. However, this was criticized by Zhao Ziyang. On May 4, Zhao Ziyang delivered the "Asian Development Bank Speech," on May 6, he instructed to further increase the "publicity" of the student movement reports, and on May 16, in his conversation with Gorbachev, he again directed the attacks at Deng Xiaoping. During this period, Yan Jiaqi, based on the spirit of Zhao Ziyang's speech, concentrated on attacking the April 26 editorial and the Shanghai Municipal Committee's decision, concentrating on attacking Deng Xiaoping, and planning the escalation of the turmoil.

On the evening of April 27, after the large march, Yan Jiaqi said, "This march is our victory."

On April 28, he drafted and distributed an open letter titled "Defending Press Freedom," signed by him and other individuals, attacking the Shanghai Municipal Committee's decision to handle the "Herald," inciting the news industry to hold support activities and petition gatherings.

After the "Asian Development Bank Speech" was published, Yan Jiaqi said, "Now there is a turning point," immediately proposing to "mobilize the intellectual community to support Zhao Ziyang." Subsequently, he and Su Shaozhi posted a big character poster titled "We Can No Longer Be Silent," mobilizing intellectuals to march.

On May 14, Yan Jiaqi and 12 other individuals issued an "Urgent Appeal on the Current Situation," demanding that the central government publicly announce that the entire student movement is a "patriotic democratic movement," acknowledge the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students" as a "legal organization," and threaten the Party and the government not to take coercive measures against the students' hunger strike, otherwise they would "become historical criminals." This "appeal," after being finalized by Yan Jiaqi, was first read in Tiananmen Square, then broadcast on Central Television, and finally published in the May 15 issue of the "Guangming Daily." The demands proposed in the "appeal" immediately became the political demands of the students and, through the media, created a serious situation where the hunger-striking students were held hostage to blackmail the Party and the government.

On May 15, he led some individuals to hold the first march of the so-called "Chinese Intellectual Community" and gave a speech in Tiananmen Square, supporting the students to continue their hunger strike.

On May 16, he led the participation in the march of some individuals from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to support the hunger-striking students and, with some individuals, issued the "May 16 Declaration," again demanding that the Party and the government acknowledge the "legitimacy of the student self-governing organizations" and acknowledge that the April 26 editorial is "wrong."

On May 17, he initiated and drafted the "May 17 Declaration," launching a vicious personal attack on Deng Xiaoping, saying, "Because the dictator holds unlimited power, the government has lost its responsibility and humanity. The Qing Dynasty has been dead for 76 years, but China still has an emperor without a title, an old and foolish dictator. Yesterday afternoon, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang publicly announced that all decisions in China must go through this old dictator," shouting, "The old man's politics must end! The dictator must resign!"

Yan Jiaqi's above activities reflect Zhao Ziyang's intentions from above and extend his black hands to the students and intellectuals from below, reflecting from an important aspect the basic process of this turmoil from its brewing to its initiation, gradual escalation, and reaching its climax. It reveals the basic trajectory of the turmoil planners from public opinion preparation to organization, incitement, and direct command. By the time of the "May 17 Declaration," their reactionary plots and the political essence of the turmoil were fully exposed.

On May 17, the Standing Committee of the Politburo discussed the issue of imposing martial law in some areas of Beijing. On May 19, Li Peng and Yang Shangkun made important speeches at a meeting of party, government, and military responsible comrades, and on May 20, the martial law was announced. Zhao Ziyang opposed the central government's correct decision, publicly split the Party, and openly exposed his attitude of splitting with the Party to the entire Party, the country, and the world. In coordination with this, the planners and organizers of the turmoil became even more frantic in directing their attacks at Deng Xiaoping, Li Peng, and Yang Shangkun, organizing the convening of an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attempting to repeal the martial law, remove Li Peng, organize large-scale marches against the martial law, and inevitably push the turmoil towards a counter-revolutionary rebellion. At this stage, Yan Jiaqi not only continued to lead in incitement but also jumped to the forefront to assume the roles of direct organizer and commander, showing unprecedented counter-revolutionary fervor in promoting the turmoil's transformation into a rebellion.

After May 19, he repeatedly organized and presided over meetings of the "Beijing Intellectual Federation" and the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students" at the Institute of Political Science of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, with participants including Su Shaozhi, Wang Dan, and Wu'erkaixi, planning unified actions to resist the martial law.

On May 20, Bao Tong saw that the situation was hopeless and proposed, "The Party can no longer solve the problem; it can only rely on the People's Congress." On this day, Yan Jiaqi told people, "Li Peng should be overthrown, and we should convene an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to remove him." He also participated in the march against the martial law and, with some individuals, issued the "Oath of the Intellectual Community," declaring, "We will never betray our conscience, never surrender to tyranny, and never bow to the last emperor of 1980s China."

On May 21, he and some individuals planned and organized the Intellectual Federation, first in Beijing, and then the second step, "the overall goal is for Li Peng to step down." On the same day, he and a group of people sent a telegram to the leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, demanding the immediate convening of an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

On May 23, the "Beijing Intellectual Federation" was officially established, with Bao Zhenxin in charge of coordination. Some people said that after the national Intellectual Federation was established, Yan Jiaqi would be in charge of coordination. On the same day, a copy of the "Declaration of the Establishment of the Beijing Intellectual Federation" was published in full in the Taiwan "United Daily News." The "Declaration" attacked the central government's decisions and the State Council's martial law as "retrograde actions," calling for the immediate convening of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to "review the case of removing Li Peng." That evening, they called on the attendees to sit in and demonstrate in Tiananmen Square and distributed their edited "News Flash" in Tiananmen Square, cursing Li Peng and demanding to "put him on the guillotine of history."

On May 24, the "Tiananmen Square Command Center" and the "Joint Conference of Various Circles in the Capital" were also announced to be established. Through this form, Yan Jiaqi and others organized the "Intellectual Federation," formally forming a counter-revolutionary alliance with the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students," the "Beijing Citizens' Self-Government Federation," the "Beijing Workers' Suicide Squad," the "Beijing Workers' Patrol Squad," and the "Beijing Citizens' Suicide Squad," and so on. The so-called "cultural elites" and social dregs were completely combined, and they vowed in their joint oath to "not fear bloodshed and sacrifice" to overthrow the government of our country.

On May 26, Yan Jiaqi and Bao Zhenxin published a "Letter to Li Peng" in a Hong Kong newspaper, again threatening to repeal the martial law and "remove Li Peng."

On May 27, he participated in the meeting to organize the so-called "5000 intellectual elites' hunger strike." Later, a farce of only Liu Xiaobo and a few others participating in a 48-hour to 72-hour hunger strike was staged.

Until June 3, after the counter-revolutionary rebellion broke out, Yan Jiaqi was still directly commanding. That evening, he was at the Jianwai Bridge overpass participating in and commanding the "blocking of military vehicles entering the city." At 10:30, he returned home. At 11:30, he rushed to Tiananmen Square to participate in the so-called "opening ceremony of the Democratic University" and served as the "honorary principal." He gave a 20-minute inciting speech, declaring that Li Peng must "resign voluntarily," otherwise he "will be judged!" He also shouted to forge their "democracy" with blood and life.

After the martial law was announced, Yan Jiaqi and others knew that their situation was hopeless. However, like all reactionaries, they were unwilling to accept their failure and thus combined the "elites" of the turmoil with various social dregs into a reactionary force, making a desperate attempt to overthrow the socialist People's Republic of China. They were doomed to fail. In this gamble that lost everything, Yan Jiaqi's constant boasting of democracy, rule of law, non-violence, and other grand exteriors were completely trampled by their ruthless actions of violating the Constitution and laws and plotting to overthrow the people's democratic government. His role as a planner, organizer, and commander of the counter-revolutionary rebellion was fully exposed.

After the counter-revolutionary rebellion was suppressed, Yan Jiaqi fled abroad under the planning of foreign hostile forces, taking his wife with him. Abroad, he still bitterly cursed the Chinese government and the Chinese people. This is good, as it voluntarily admits that he is not only a reactionary against communism and socialism but also a traitor to the nation.

On July 4, Yan Jiaqi and Wu'erkaixi jointly issued the so-called "National Mourning Sunday Declaration" in Paris, France, calling for the establishment of the "Chinese Student and Citizen Movement Joint Committee" abroad to create greater "storms" on the mainland. At the same time, the head of the "Chinese Federal Union" in the United States, Wang Bingzhang, rushed to Hong Kong and announced the establishment of a "Chinese opposition party in exile," nominating "Yan Jiaqi as the first leader of this party," and "another candidate" was Fang Lizhi. These words can well illustrate the hopes that the traitors and international anti-communist and anti-China forces have placed on Yan Jiaqi. In mid-July, Yan Jiaqi convened a secret meeting in Paris with some individuals to plan the establishment of the so-called "Democratic China Front" with the purpose of opposing the Chinese government, advocating for the overthrow of the Chinese socialist system. It seems that Yan Jiaqi, supported by hostile forces abroad, still wants to continue the struggle with the Chinese people. We must completely suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion and be vigilant against the new plots of a few stubborn individuals, always preventing them from causing trouble. However, we must warn them: anyone who engages in retrogressive actions and opposes the Chinese people will not have a good outcome. Their plots, which have already failed at home, will not achieve anything by relying on foreign reactionary forces to continue causing trouble. They will ultimately fail, and the great cause of socialist construction and reform and opening up of the Chinese people will definitely advance and win, which is the inevitable trend of history.

### 动乱“精英”严家其

    动乱“精英”严家其
    李建生
    一些自命为知识界“精英”其实是中国知识分子败类的人物，在北京的动乱和反革命暴乱中，担当了策划者、煽动者和组织者、指挥者的角色。严家其是其中一个主要代表人物。
                    （一）
    在一些不明真相的人看来，严家其是“学术精英”。实际上，十年前他就是一个热衷于街头政治和非法活动的怀有政治野心的人。那个时候，他忙于同北京与外地的一些非法组织如“启蒙社”、“振兴社”、非法刊物如《四五报》以及它们的头头密切联系，参加会议，出谋划策，解囊相助。他自己还直接参与“西单墙”下的各种活动，成为鼓吹西方“民主”、“自由”的活跃分子。他就是从这里开始他的政治生涯的。
    “西单墙”和非法组织被取缔后，严家其着手“研究”政治学。研究的“成果”主要是三本书：一本是由大小字报和各种谣言、传闻拼凑起来的《文化大革命十年史》，一本是宣扬资产阶级政治观的《首脑论》，还有一本是自我吹嘘、自我标榜的《思想自传》。他的基本政治观点，是主张中国实行不要共产党领导的“三权分立”、“权力制衡”，认为马克思主义是一种“封闭的思想体系”，保卫马克思主义的纯洁性就是“保卫中国封建文化”。总之，是要取消四项基本原则，在中国推销美国式的资产阶级民主。他同顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的一些人密切配合，互相呼应，成为一个重要的代表人物。正因为如此，他被海内外一些人捧为“新型政治学家”、“政治精英”、“政治体制改革理论权威”和“民主斗士”、“自由派知识分子代表”、“当代世界名人”等等，名噪一时。他还频繁“出访”一些西方大国，颇受某些西方政治首脑的青睐，心甘情愿地充当西方资产阶级在中国的一个代言人。他被赵紫阳同志和鲍彤看中，是不奇怪的。1986年秋，他们将严家其调到中央政治体制改革研讨小组办公室担任要职。鲍彤还打电话通知中国社会科学院，一要保留严家其的政治学所所长职务，二要派车保证他的活动需要。严家其从此成了被称为赵紫阳智囊班子的重要成员。
    1987年初，反对资产阶级自由化开始后，严家其受到有关部门的审查。但是，严家其立即向鲍彤求援，向他写信为自己的错误辩解。3月20日，鲍彤以中央政体改研讨小组办公室名义向赵紫阳写报告，说审查中提出的严家其的错误事实是“误解”、“以讹传讹”，称赞严家其“是守纪律的”，要他继续留在政体改研讨小组“照常工作”。赵紫阳同志立即表示同意，并批示有关负责同志“阅知”。这样，严家其就被包庇了下来。
                  （二）
    党的十三届三中全会以后，面对党内外强烈批评，赵紫阳同志不仅不检查自己的错误，反而消极对待中央的治理整顿方针。在这之后，那个被称为智囊团里的人物透露，要刮起一阵“倒邓保赵”风，并由海外一些反动报刊透底，鼓噪只有“邓小平完全退休”，由赵紫阳“独裁改革”，“中国才有希望”。
    这是一个政治信号。严家其，这个一头连着鲍彤、一头连着海外国外反共反华势力的人物，在“倒邓保赵”风中最引人注目的行动，是和温元凯发表《关于时局的对话》。这篇对话由后来在动乱和反革命暴乱中颇为活跃的《经济学周报》一位记者整理，几乎同时在《经济学周报》和一些香港报刊刊出，《世界经济导报》也发表了内容大体相同的消息。对话的要害，仍然可以用“倒邓保赵”概括。用他们的话来说，中央治理整顿的方针是“倒退”，党内外对赵紫阳的错误的批评使“改革成果面临断送”的“危险”，如果赵紫阳下台，中国社会经济发展就会出现“停滞”，因此要反对“非程序的权力更迭”。这“非程序”三个字很费了一番心机，值得特别注意。这已经不再有任何学术气味，完全是一种赤裸裸的政治动员。
    与此同时，他向人们推荐了一套所谓“程序”。去年11月，他在《世界经济导报》发表谈话，要人们放弃坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化和抵制精神污染的斗争，把腐败的根源归结到公有制上，要求“积极发展私有制”，并从苏共历史谈起，提出“撤销政治局”，建立一种所谓华盛顿式的程序。今年2月，他又在日本提出“必须废除中共中央政治局”。总之，他追求和宣扬的是取消社会主义制度和共产党领导地位的西方政治体制。他还在今年某青年刊物第2期上发表谈话，鼓吹按他那套“程序”修改我国宪法，规定国家政权如何组成，由谁来掌握国家政权。如果不遵循他的这套“程序”呢？他说“就只有通过非程序的方式来表达，比如诉诸暴力或动乱”！请注意，严家其已经由反对“非程序”走到鼓动非程序。他的这些活动，同方励之等人的“新启蒙沙龙”，陈军等人的签名上书，戈扬等人的演说，李淑娴、王丹等人主持的集会，以及北京一些大学里直接攻击党和社会主义制度的大小字报一起，给动乱作了直接的舆论准备和组织准备。
    4月15日胡耀邦同志逝世后，极少数人立即乘机利用学潮制造动乱。游行、静坐和冲击新华门的活动中出现了大量政治口号，最核心的两条就是要为胡耀邦同志“平反”和彻底否定反对资产阶级自由化。严家其正是紧紧抓住了这两条出谋划策，进行煽动。
    4月19日，《世界经济导报》和《新观察》在北京召集一些人物座谈，不少人把攻击矛头直指中央。严家其发言说：“对天安门广场上只要去看一看，就知道无非是要对耀邦作出公正的评价，要对1986年的某些运动作出公正的评价”，“在天安门广场上面，我就看到了中国的前途和希望”。他不仅画龙点睛地概括出两个实质性口号，使之成为动乱初期的行动纲领，并直接为非法游行叫好，给动乱煽风点火。
    4月21日，在鲍彤的授意下，他和包遵信贴出《致中共中央、人大常委会、国务院的公开信》，要中央承认游行、静坐中提出的要求都是“积极”的“民主要求”，向中央施加压力。包遵信后来对香港《百姓》杂志的记者说，这封信“对学生的鼓舞很大”。
    4月26日人民日报重要社论发表后，上海市委按中央精神作出了整顿《世界经济导报》的决定。但是，遭到赵紫阳同志的非难。赵紫阳5月4日发表“亚行讲话”，5月6日指示要进一步加强对学潮报道的“公开程度”，5月16日在会见戈尔巴乔夫的谈话中又把矛头引向邓小平同志。在这一阶段，严家其依据赵紫阳讲话的精神，集中攻击4·26社论和上海市委决定，集中攻击邓小平同志，策划动乱的不断升级。
    4月27日大游行的当晚，严家其说：这次游行
  “是我们的一个胜利”。
    4月28日，他起草并散发了由他和其他一些人署名的公开信《捍卫新闻自由》，攻击上海市委处理《导报》的决定，煽动新闻界进行声援活动和请愿集会。
      “亚行讲话”一发表，严家其说“现在出现了转机”，立即提出要“发动知识界支持赵紫阳”。随后，他与苏绍智等一伙人贴出《我们再也不能沉默了》的大字报，动员知识界人士起来游行。
    5月14日，严家其同其他共12人发出《我们对今天局势的紧急呼吁》，要中央公开宣布整个学潮
  “是爱国民主运动”，承认“北高联”为“合法组织”，威胁党和政府不得对学生绝食采取强制措施，否则
  “将成为历史罪人”。这一“呼吁”由严家其定稿后，先在天安门广场宣读，又在中央电视台播出，然后在15日的《光明日报》发表。《呼吁》提出的要求，立即变成学生的政治要求，并通过舆论工具造成了以绝食学生为人质要挟党和政府的严重局面。
    5月15日，他带领一些人搞所谓“中国知识界”的首次游行，并到天安门广场发表演说，支持学生继续绝食。
    5月16日，他又带头参加中国社会科学院一些人声援绝食学生的游行，并与一些人发表《5·16声明》，再次要党和政府承认“学生自治组织的合法性”，承认4·26社论“是错误的”。
      5月17日，他又发起和起草《5·17宣言》，对邓小平同志进行恶毒的人身攻击，说“由于独裁者掌握了无限权力，政府丧失了自己的责任，丧失了人性”，“清王朝已经死亡76年了，但是，中国还有一位没有皇帝头衔的皇帝，一位年迈昏庸的独裁者”，“昨天下午，赵紫阳总书记公开宣布，中国的一切决策，都必须经过这位老朽的独裁者”，叫嚷“老人政治必须结束！独裁者必须辞职！”
    严家其的上述活动，上面体现了赵紫阳的意图，下面把黑手伸向学生和知识界，从一个重要侧面反映出这场动乱从酝酿到发动、经过逐步升级达到高潮的基本过程，揭示了动乱的策划者们从舆论准备到组织、煽动和直接出面指挥的基本轨迹。到了《5·17宣言》，他们的反动图谋和动乱的政治实质就和盘托出了。
                    （三）
    5月17日，中央政治局常委讨论了在北京部分地区实行戒严的问题，19日李鹏、杨尚昆同志在党政军负责干部大会上作了重要讲话，20日发布戒严令。赵紫阳同志反对中央的正确决策，公开分裂党，并把同党闹分裂的态度公开暴露在全党全国和全世界面前。与此相配合，动乱的策划组织者更加疯狂地把攻击矛头指向邓小平、李鹏、杨尚昆同志，策动召开人大常委紧急会议，企图废除戒严令，罢免李鹏，组织反对戒严令的大规模游行等活动，使动乱不可避免地走向反革命暴乱。到了这个阶段，严家其不但在煽动方面继续领衔主演，而且跳到前台承担起直接组织者和指挥者的角色，在推动动乱向暴乱的演变中表现出前所未有的反革命狂热。
    5月19日后，他多次在社会科学院政治学所组织并主持有苏绍智、王丹、吾尔开希等参加的“北京知识界联合会”和“北京高自联”联席会议，策划对抗戒严令的统一行动。
    5月20日，鲍彤看到败局已定，提出“党内已不能解决问题了，只能靠人大”。这一天，严家其对人说：“李鹏应该打倒，要通过召开全国人大常委紧急会议罢免他。”他还参加了反对戒严的大游行，并与一些人发出《我们知识界的誓言》，声称“绝不出卖自己的良知，绝不向专制屈服，绝不向八十年代中国的末代皇帝称臣”。
    5月21日，他和一些人策划组织知识分子联合会，先组织北京的，再走第二步，“总的目标就是李鹏下台”。同一天，他和一伙人致电人大常委会领导人，要求立即召开全国人大常委会紧急会议。
    5月23日，“北京知识界联合会”正式成立，由包遵信负责统筹。有人说，待全国的知识界联合会成立，就该由严家其负责统筹了。同一天，《北京知识界联合会成立宣言》复印件即在台湾《联合报》全文发表。《宣言》攻击中央的决策、国务院的戒严令为“倒行逆施”，呼吁“立即”召开全国人大常委会，“审议罢免李鹏案”。当晚他们号召入会者到天安门广场静坐示威，并在天安门广场散发他们编辑的《新闻快讯》，咒骂李鹏同志，要把他“押上历史的断头台”。
    5月24日，“天安门广场总指挥部”和“首都各界联席会议”又宣告成立，通过这一形式，严家其等人组织的“知识界联合会”，同“北京高自联”、“北京市民自治联合会”、“北京工人敢死队”、“北京工人纠察队”、“北京市民敢死队”等正式结成了反革命行动的“神圣同盟”，所谓“文化精英”和社会渣滓完全结合在一起，他们在共同誓词中叫嚷要“不怕流血牺牲”去推翻我国的政府。
    5月26日严家其和包遵信在香港报纸发表《告李鹏书》，再次扬言要废除戒严令，“罢免李鹏”。
    5月27日，他参加了组织所谓“5000知识精英大绝食”的会议。后来，演出了一场只有刘晓波等4人参加的48小时至72小时的绝食闹剧。
    直至6月3日，反革命暴乱发生后，严家其仍在直接指挥。当天傍晚，他一直在建国门立交桥参与和指挥“堵塞军车进城的活动”，10时半才回到家中。11时多，他又赶到天安门广场，参加所谓“民主大学的开学典礼”，并担任“名誉校长”。他发表了20分钟的煽动性演讲，宣称李鹏必须“主动辞职”，否则“必将受到审判”！他还叫嚷要用鲜血和生命来铸造他们的“民主”。
    在戒严令发布之后，严家其们知道他们大势已去。但是同一切反动分子一样，他们不甘心自己的失败，于是把动乱“精英”和各种社会渣滓拼凑为一支反动力量，为颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国作拚死一搏。他们是注定要输的。在这输掉老本的一搏中，严家其口口声声标榜的民主、法制、非暴力等堂皇外衣，已被他们肆意践踏宪法和法律、阴谋推翻人民民主政权的凶残暴行所彻底撕碎，他作为反革命暴乱的一个策划者、组织者和指挥者的面目已暴露无遗。

    反革命暴乱平息后，严家其在国外敌对势力的策划下，带着老婆逃跑了。在国外，他还在咬牙切齿地咒骂中国政府和中国人民。这样很好，好就好在不打自招地供认他不仅是一个反共反社会主义的反动分子，而且是一个背叛祖国的民族败类。
    7月4日，严家其和吾尔开希在法国巴黎联名发表所谓《国殇周日宣言》，叫嚷要在国外成立“中国学运民运联合委员会”，在中国大陆制造更大的“风暴”。与此同时，在美国的“中国民联”头子王炳章跑到香港，宣布要成立一个“流亡的中国反对党”，提名“严家其担任这个党的第一任领导人”，“另一个人选”是方励之。这番话，很能表明卖国贼们和国际反共反华势力在严家其身上寄予的希望。7月中旬，严家其又召集一些人在巴黎秘密举行会议，策划成立以反对中国政府为宗旨的所谓“民主中国阵线”，鼓吹推翻中国社会主义制度。看来，得到海外国外敌对势力支持的严家其们，还要和中国人民继续较量下去。我们一定要彻底平息这场反革命暴乱，同时警惕极少数顽固分子的新的阴谋，随时防止他们捣乱。不过，我们要正告他们：凡是倒行逆施，与中国人民为敌的人，是绝不会有好下场的。他们的阴谋既然在国内已经以失败而告终，那么靠海外国外反动势力支撑继续进行捣乱，是成不了什么气候的。他们终究要失败，中国人民伟大的社会主义建设和改革开放事业一定要前进、要胜利，这是历史的必然。
