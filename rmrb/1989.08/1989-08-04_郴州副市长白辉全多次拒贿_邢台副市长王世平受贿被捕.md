    Deputy Mayor Bai Huiguang of Chenzhou, Hunan Province, is known for his integrity and has repeatedly rejected bribes, earning praise.

    Last December, a private entrepreneur visited Bai Huiguang's home to discuss a job transfer for his uncle. Finding Bai Huiguang absent, the entrepreneur left a note and 800 yuan. Upon learning of this the next day, Bai Huiguang immediately handed over the note and the money to the city's supervision bureau. In March of this year, a sales representative from a factory in another province sought Bai Huiguang's help in purchasing substandard matches from the Chenzhou Match Factory to resell for profit. Bai Huiguang promptly refused. Taking advantage of Bai Huiguang's brief absence, the sales representative placed 1,000 yuan on the bed. The next day, Bai Huiguang sternly criticized the sales representative and returned the money in full. In June, Bai Huiguang traveled to Shenzhen to sign an economic contract with a Hong Kong company. The Hong Kong manager, as a token of thanks, gifted him a high-end suit worth 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. Upon returning to Chenzhou, Bai Huiguang immediately reported the incident to the city's supervision bureau and handed over the suit.

    According to a report in the *Hebei Daily*, Wang Shiping, deputy mayor of Xingtai, Hebei Province, accepted bribes during his tenure. After the Xingtai Municipal People's Procuratorate completed its investigation, the case was reported to the Xingtai Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee for approval. Wang was recently indicted on charges of bribery and handed over to the Xingtai Intermediate People's Court for trial.

    In March, the Xingtai County Vegetable Oil Factory needed a 2.5 million yuan loan for a project and sought Wang Shiping's help in finding a guarantor. Learning that Wang Shiping wanted to buy a video camera and a refrigerator, Zhang Enhui, the factory director, purchased a "Gaisida" brand video camera and a "Toshiba" brand refrigerator from Japan, priced at 3,300 yuan and 4,500 yuan respectively, on March 26 and early April. Wang's son and Wang himself took the items, with Wang paying only 1,000 yuan in cash. During this period, Wang actively sought a guarantor for the Xingtai County Vegetable Oil Factory but was unsuccessful.

    In May, Zhang Enhui was detained for investigation by the public security authorities. Upon learning of the exposure, Wang Shiping, along with his second son, fabricated evidence. Wang's second son, impersonating Zhang Enhui's wife, wrote a false receipt stating that the additional payment for the video camera and refrigerator totaling 4,500 yuan had been received, attempting to cover up the truth, but ultimately failed.

    郴州副市长白辉全多次拒贿  邢台副市长王世平受贿被捕
    本报讯　湖南省郴州市副市长白辉全廉洁奉公，多次拒贿，受到好评。
    去年12月，一个体户为其叔叔的工作调动问题跑到白辉全家，见白辉全不在家，他便留下一张纸条和800元钱。白辉全第二天知道这件事后，当即将纸条和钱一并交给了市监察局。今年3月，外省某厂一业务员为了从郴州火柴厂购买次品火柴，加工出售牟利，恳求白辉全给火柴厂打个招呼，白辉全当即回绝。此人趁他离座片刻的机会，将1000元钱放在床上。第二天，白辉全对这名业务员进行了严肃批评，并将钱如数退还。今年6月白辉全到深圳与香港一家公司签订经济合同。港方经理为了致谢，送给他一套价值3000元港币的高档西服。他回到郴州，立即向市监察局报告此事，并将西服交公。

    本报讯　据《河北日报》报道：河北省邢台市副市长王世平，在任职期间收受贿赂，经邢台市人民检察院侦查终结，并报请邢台市人大常委会批准，于不久前以受贿罪被提起公诉，交付邢台市中级人民法院审判。
    今年3月，邢台县植物油厂引进项目需要250万元贷款，厂长赵恩惠为找贷款担保单位，便求助于王世平。当赵恩惠得知王世平想买录相机和电冰箱时，于3月26日和4月初，以3300元和4500的价格购买“高士达”牌录像机、日产“东芝”牌电冰箱各一台，分别由王世平的儿子和王世平本人取走，王只付现金1000元。这期间，王世平积极为邢台县植物油厂找担保单位，但未能办成。
    5月份，赵恩惠被公安机关收容审查。王世平得知事情败露后，遂与其次子一起制造伪证，由其次子冒赵恩惠妻子之名写下收到补交录相机、电冰箱款4500元的假收条，企图掩盖真相，但终未得逞。
