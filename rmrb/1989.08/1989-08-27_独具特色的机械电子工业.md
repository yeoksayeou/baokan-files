Before liberation, Guizhou's mechanical and electronic industry was virtually non-existent. After the founding of the nation, builders from all over the country worked diligently to draw blueprints, build factories, and create a picture of self-reliance and hard work on the Guizhou plateau.

More than 20 years ago, a construction army of over 100,000 people from the Third Front moved into the deep mountains and valleys of Guizhou. Modern factories emerged from the once barren lands. The relocated enterprises, along with those developed in the 1950s, formed a relatively complete mechanical and electronic industry system, establishing four major production bases for abrasives, electrical appliances, instruments and meters, and optical instruments.

However, until the late 1970s, the three major military industrial bases, which accounted for more than half of the large and medium-sized enterprises in the province, remained scattered and hidden, largely unknown to the public.

Reform and opening up opened the closed mountain gates, and the hidden tigers in the deep mountains roared out. Military industrial enterprises, which accounted for more than one-fifth of the fixed assets of state-owned industrial enterprises in the province, half of the engineering and technical personnel, and one-third of the metal cutting and forging equipment, took the leading position in Guizhou's mechanical and electronic industry with their indisputable advantages. They became a powerful force in the development and enrichment of Guizhou.

Guizhou Aviation Industry Corporation took the lead in successfully developing domestically produced components for imported assembly cars like the Shanghai Santana, becoming one of the most important automobile component production groups in the country. The Guizhou Aerospace Industry Corporation has also formed a production system centered around refrigerators and light-duty vehicles. China Vibration Electronic Industry Corporation's products cover components, communications, home appliances, and other fields. They have also established dozens of "window" enterprises along the coast, paving a successful path of internal and external cooperation.

Guizhou's mechanical and electrical industry has significantly increased its strength, and mechanical and electrical products have replaced traditional agricultural and sideline products as the main export earners for Guizhou.

During the 10-year strategy of "defense to civilian use," the civilian product output value of Guizhou's military industrial enterprises almost doubled every year, reaching 1.26 billion yuan in 1988. Many products have "high, precise, and advanced" characteristics. Now, a batch of deeply hidden military industrial enterprises have moved to the suburbs of Guiyang. New "Electronic City" and "Aviation City" will emerge here.

    独具特色的机械电子工业
    解放前的贵州机械电子工业，近乎白纸一张。建国后，来自五湖四海的建设者，潜心绘蓝图，开山建厂房，在贵州高原绘出了一幅自力更生、艰苦奋斗的创业画卷。
    20多年前，一支10余万人的三线建设大军，开进贵州深山大沟。昔日荒凉的土地上，崛起了上百座现代化的工厂。内迁企业与50年代发展起来的一批企业一起，构成一个较为完整的机械电子工业体系，形成了磨料磨具、电器、仪器仪表、光学仪器四大生产基地。
    然而，直到70年代末期，拥有全省一半以上大中型企业的三大军工基地，一直分散隐蔽，鲜为人知。
    改革开放打开了封闭的山门，深山卧虎呼啸出山。拥有全省国营工业企业1／5以上固定资产、一半以上工程技术人员和1／3以上金属切削和锻压设备的军工企业，凭借其无可争议的优势，当之无愧地夺取了贵州机械电子工业的霸主地位，成为兴黔富民的一支后来居上的生力军。
    贵州航空工业总公司领先一步，连连开发成功上海桑塔纳等进口组装小汽车的国产化零配件，成为国内最重要的汽车零配件生产集团之一。贵州航天工业总公司以冰箱和轻型汽车为主体的生产体系也已形成。中国振华电子工业公司产品涉及元器件、通讯、家电等领域，还在沿海开办了数十家“窗口”企业，闯出了一条成功的外引内联之路。
    贵州机电工业实力大增，机电产品取代传统的农副产品，成为贵州主要的出口创汇商品。
    在10年的“保军转民”战略转移期间，贵州军工企业的民品产值，几乎一年翻一番，1988年达12.6亿元，许多产品具有“高、精、尖”的特色。如今，一批钻山太深的军工企业迁至贵阳市郊。崭新的“电子城”和“航空城”将在这里出现。
