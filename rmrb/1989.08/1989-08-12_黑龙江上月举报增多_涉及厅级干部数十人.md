Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, August 12th - (Reporter Liu Yu Xun) Recently, reporters visited the discipline inspection and supervision departments of Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City to learn that the number of reports received by the Provincial Administrative Supervision Reporting Center in July increased by 41% compared to the monthly average of the first half of the year, and the number of letters of accusation and complaint received by the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission was 24% higher than the monthly average of the second quarter. The number of reports and complaints received by these two departments in Harbin City also showed a significant increase.

Su Yucheng, deputy director of the Provincial Administrative Supervision Reporting Center, told reporters that there were two notable features in the reports received in July: First, the public dared to report high-ranking leaders, with the number of reported department and section-level officials increasing by 12.5% and 16.3% respectively compared to the monthly average of the first half of the year. Second, there was an increase in the number of people who reported using their real names and those who reported in person. The Heilongjiang Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission also provided similar facts: In July, 35 department and bureau-level officials were accused, which was 41.7% higher than the monthly average of the first half of the year.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided to select more than a hundred case leads from the public's reports, form a special team to investigate and verify each one, and then publicly handle a batch of typical cases at an appropriate time. It is understood that these case leads involve 123 department and bureau-level officials and county-level party and government leaders.
