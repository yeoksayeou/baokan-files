The State Council Executive Meeting, presided over by Premier Li Peng, was held today. The meeting reviewed and approved a decision on further cleaning up and rectifying companies.

The meeting pointed out that in October 1988, the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council issued a decision on cleaning up and rectifying companies. Since then, various localities and departments have done a lot of work in this regard and achieved certain results. However, due to an insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of this work, the measures taken were not specific or effective enough. Many places and departments hesitated and delayed action. Additionally, the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion interfered with the work, so the cleaning up and rectifying of companies has not yet achieved the expected results. The meeting believes that it is necessary to take practical and effective measures to further grasp, improve, and complete the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies. This is not only an important part of rectifying the economic environment, improving economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms, but also a crucial measure to resolutely combat corruption and boost the morale of the Party and the people. It is not just an economic issue but also a political issue of great concern to the entire nation. The meeting requires that in the process of cleaning up and rectifying, the central state organs should take the lead and set an example. Various departments and regions should, in accordance with the overall requirements of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, combine their own actual situations, take specific, clear, and practical measures, and carry out the work seriously and responsibly.

Nine members of the State Council Executive Meeting attended today's meeting, and five were absent due to official business.

    国务院常务会议通过决定
    进一步清理整顿公司
    认为清理整顿有成绩还远没有取得预期效果  要求中央国家机关带头各部门各地措施切实
    新华社北京8月11日电　国务院总理李鹏今天主持召开国务院第45次常务会议。会议审议并通过了有关进一步清理整顿公司的决定。
    会议指出，1988年10月中共中央、国务院曾作出清理整顿公司的决定。自那时以来，各地方、各部门在清理整顿公司方面做了不少工作，取得了一定成绩。但由于对这一工作的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，措施不够具体有力，不少地方和部门犹豫观望，行动迟缓，再加上动乱和反革命暴乱的干扰，清理整顿公司的工作还远没有取得预期效果。会议认为，必须采取切实有效的措施，进一步把清理整顿公司的工作抓紧、抓好、抓到底。这既是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的重要内容，又是坚决惩治腐败、振奋党心民心的一项重要措施，不仅是经济领域的问题，而且是全国上下十分关注的政治问题。会议要求，在清理整顿工作中，中央国家机关要首先带头做好，作出表率。各部门、各地区要按照中共中央、国务院的总的要求，结合自己的实际情况，采取具体、明确、切实有效的措施，认真负责地进行。
    出席今天会议的国务院常务会议成员9人，因公请假的5人。
