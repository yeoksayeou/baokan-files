The Daba Mountains region of Sichuan Province is located in the heart of the Daba Mountains. To fundamentally change the backward appearance of the mountainous region, the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Commission listed the Daba Mountains region as a key development area in the province in 1985; in 1986, the State Science and Technology Commission listed "Daba Mountains Technology Development" as a key project of the national "Spark Program" and one of the national key development areas. Since then, the spark of science and technology has been ignited in the dense mountains here, gradually forming a raging inferno. Over the past four years, more than a thousand science and technology personnel and the people of the entire region have worked together, and currently, 80% of the projects (a total of 70 projects) have completed their phase objectives. The total new output value is 1.5 billion yuan, new taxes and profits amount to more than 310 million yuan, and foreign exchange earnings exceed 130 million yuan. Farmers have increased their income by more than 1 billion yuan.

In implementing the "Spark Program" in the Daba Mountains region, the challenges faced include a shortage of funds, a lack of talent, and poor information flow. To overcome these difficulties, various levels of leadership organized the financial, banking, economic, and science and technology departments to raise funds from multiple channels, totaling more than 300 million yuan, and bundled the funds for use to maximize their overall benefits. When specifically implementing development, they applied the principles of systems engineering, focusing on market needs and the main resources of the mountainous region, aiming to help farmers escape poverty and increase their income, and the fiscal revenue year by year. They divided the development into three levels: high, medium, and low. The first level: focus on a few pillar industries with Daba Mountains characteristics that can make a significant impact and conduct series development; the second level: focus on the technological development of demonstration township enterprises; the third level: focus on scientific and technological poverty alleviation and technological development. At the same time, they adhered to the policy of opening up the mountainous region to promote development, and successively collaborated with more than 400 colleges and universities, research institutes, and industrial and mining enterprises within and outside the province to introduce various technologies and management talents totaling 1,107 people. They also adopted various methods to train more than 340,000 technical personnel.

Over the past four years, the initial success of implementing the "Spark Program" in the Daba Mountains region has paved a new path for revitalizing the mountainous economy through science and technology. Their successful experience was summarized by a responsible comrade from the State Science and Technology Commission as the "Dazhou Model," which includes: strengthening leadership, establishing and improving the management system; working together, taking the path of integrating science and technology, economy, finance, and banking; applying the principles of systems engineering for layered development; developing intellectual resources, strengthening horizontal cooperation, and promoting development through openness. Currently, their experience is being promoted to mountainous regions nationwide that are implementing the "Spark Program."

    科技“星火”燃遍大巴山
    四川省达县地区位于大巴山的腹心地带。为了彻底改变山区的落后面貌，四川省科委1985年将大巴山区列入全省重点开发地区；1986年，国家科委将“大巴山区技术开发”列为全国“星火计划”重点项目和全国重点开发山区之一。从此，科技“星火”在这里的万山丛中点燃，逐渐形成燎原之势。经过千余名科技人员和全区人民4年来的共同奋战，目前已有80％的项目（项目总数为70个）完成阶段任务，总共新增产值1.5亿元，新创税利3100多万元，创汇1300多万元，农民增收1亿多元。
    在大巴山区实施“星火计划”，面临的困难是：资金短缺、人才匮乏、信息不灵。为了克服这些困难，各级领导组织财政、金融、经济、科技等部门多渠道筹集资金3000多万元，并将资金捆起来使用，使其发挥整体效益。具体实施开发时，他们应用系统工程原理，按照市场需要和山区主要资源，着眼于农民脱贫致富和财政逐年增收，分高、中、低三个层次进行。第一个层次：抓若干具有大巴山地区特色、能成大气候的支柱产业进行系列开发；第二个层次：抓技术示范性乡镇企业的技术开发；第三个层次，抓科技扶贫、技术开发。同时，他们坚持敞开山区大门，以开放促开发的方针，先后与省内外400多家高等院校、科研院所、厂矿企业单位开展技术联合协作，引进各类技术和管理人才1107人，并采取多种方式培训各类技术人才34万多人。
    4年来，大巴山区实施“星火计划”初战告捷，走出了依靠科技振兴山区经济的新路子。他们的成功经验被国家科委负责同志概括为“达县模式”，即：加强领导，建立健全管理体系；通力配合，走科技、经济、财政、金融“四位一体”的道路；应用系统工程的原理，分层次进行开发；开发智力资源，加强横向联合，以开放促开发。目前，他们的经验正向全国实施“星火计划”的山区推广。
