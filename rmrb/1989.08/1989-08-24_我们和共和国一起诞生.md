Our multi-ethnic socialist republic has been established for 40 years. As a worker in ethnic affairs, I always want to say something to express my sentiments.

On this planet, the ethnic issue is one of the biggest problems for humanity. A veteran Westerner once asserted: The ethnic issue that capitalism has not been able to solve in several hundred years, socialism wants to solve in just a few decades, which is impossible.

Not long ago, a scholar who has been dedicated to comparing the ethnic policies of various countries said after touring the mainland of China: It seems that China's ethnic theory and policy are the best.

The various ethnic minorities in China, as objective entities, have a history of several hundred, a thousand, or even several thousand years on this land. However, their equal status within the Chinese nation's family was achieved only in the 40 years of this century.

On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed. The flag of this republic bears the words "socialism." It is under the banner of socialism that the fate of China's various ethnic minorities has undergone a profound change. They are not the same age as the republic, but they were indeed born with the republic.

First, they gained recognition. From some point in time, someone invented a theory that divides races and ethnicities into superior and inferior categories, and this theory became the basis for some rulers to implement racial and ethnic oppression, external aggression, and expansion. The rulers of old China were more or less the same. Look at the pictographic Chinese characters of that time; many ethnic minority names had derogatory radicals such as "犭" and "豸." Despite the fact that ethnic minorities were equally hardworking, intelligent, and loved freedom, and had made their own contributions to the entire history and culture of the Chinese nation, they did not gain recognition. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China abolished the system of ethnic oppression and declared that all ethnic groups in China, regardless of size, are equal. All derogatory terms, inscriptions, and plaques for ethnic minorities, including the derogatory radicals in ethnic minority names mentioned earlier, were explicitly prohibited. This matter may not be well-known to many young people today. But understanding this is important; it reflects a major shift in the history of China's ethnic relations from one side.

Next, they achieved autonomy. The regional autonomy of China's various ethnic minorities was also achieved in these 40 years. After 40 years of effort, China has now established 154 ethnic autonomous areas (including 5 autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures, and 119 autonomous counties). Out of 55 ethnic minorities, except for 10 with smaller populations, 45 have achieved regional autonomy, and the population of ethnic minorities implementing autonomy accounts for 64% of the total ethnic minority population. In addition, as a supplementary form of ethnic regional autonomy, more than 1,400 ethnic townships have been established nationwide. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the legal construction of ethnic regional autonomy has been strengthened, and the first "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" in the history of China since the founding of the nation has been promulgated and implemented, and the corresponding legal construction work has also gradually been carried out.

Implementing ethnic regional autonomy is a great creation of the Chinese communists in solving the domestic ethnic issue and is the only correct choice suitable for China's national conditions. Today, when some people are inciting separatism, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of understanding the national conditions. The development of history has formed a situation where ethnic minorities in China, along with the Han nationality and other ethnic minorities, live in a pattern of large-scale intermingling, small-scale concentration, and interspersed concentration. Due to natural conditions and other reasons, there are long-established economic divisions and economic exchanges between Han areas and ethnic minority areas, and between different ethnic minority areas. There is a relationship of mutual dependence and inseparability among the various ethnic groups in the economy. In culture, the various ethnic groups also absorb and enrich each other, with each containing elements of the other. This situation has formed a cohesive force among the various ethnic groups, especially when facing external aggression, this cohesive force is more pronounced. In modern times, China's national power has declined, and the international climate has been very unfavorable for China. Imperialist powers, in order to divide China, have always adopted a strategy of dividing and conquering the various ethnic groups, inciting so-called "national independence" among ethnic minorities. After World War II, the world's situation changed, but the international capitalist forces' attempt to split China has not changed. The recent turmoil in Lhasa, Tibet, is proof of this. Although these separatist activities are carried out under the banner of "national independence," they still have a thousand and one connections with international capitalist forces. The severe facts prove that the danger of our country's ethnic groups being split has not passed, and the choice before us is two: either be divided and conquered and become a colony or vassal of capitalism; or rely on the strength of unity among ethnic groups to defeat the capitalist offensive, seek unity and survival, and achieve common development and prosperity. We only have the latter choice. The establishment of the ethnic regional autonomy system is precisely based on China's actual situation, a historical necessity, and the choice of the people of all ethnic groups.

Third, it is the help of advanced ethnic groups to backward ethnic groups. The Marxist-Leninist view of ethnic equality also requires the victorious proletariat of the advanced ethnic group to "compensate for the actual inequality in life with the inequality they face." This has been a guiding principle for our party and state in handling ethnic issues over the past 40 years. It is concentrated in laws, regulations, and rules such as the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy." Under this principle, in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, there are many preferential policies for ethnic minorities, such as in the recruitment of workers, cadres, students, and even family planning, there are considerations, while for more advanced ethnic groups, many aspects do not enjoy these.

Of course, in such a multi-ethnic country as ours, there are still many things to do to completely solve the ethnic issue, and we still have a long way to go. But looking back at the journey of these 40 years, we can proudly say: We have found a Chinese-style path to solving the ethnic issue.

    我们和共和国一起诞生
    杨候弟（藏族）
    我们多民族的社会主义人民共和国成立40年了。作为民族工作者，总想说点什么，以表心迹。
    在我们这个星球上，有个民族问题，是我们人类最大的难题之一。有一位老资格的西方人士曾断言：资本主义几百年没能解决的民族问题；社会主义才几十年就想解决，不可能。
    前不久，一位致力于各国民族政策比较研究的学者，在中国大陆转了一圈之后说：看来中国的民族理论和政策是最好的。
    中国各少数民族作为客观存在的实体，在中国这块土地上已有几百年、上千年乃至几千年的历史了，但他们在中华民族大家庭中的平等地位的获得则是本世纪40年中的事。
    1949年10月1日，中华人民共和国宣告成立。这个共和国的旗帜上写着“社会主义”。正是在社会主义的旗帜下，中国各少数民族的命运才开始发生了深刻的质变。他们同共和国并不同龄，但确和共和国一起诞生。
    首先是得到了承认。不知从什么时候起，有人发明了一种把种族和民族划分为优等和劣等的理论，而且成为一些统治者实行种族和民族压迫、对外侵略和扩张的理论依据。旧中国的历代统治者大致也是这样行事的。看看那时的象形汉字，在许多少数民族的名称上都要加上诸如“犭”和“豸”这样的侮辱性偏旁。尽管少数民族同样勤劳、智慧、酷爱自由和富于革命传统，对整个中华民族的历史和文化都曾作出过自己的贡献，但他们并没有得到承认。中华人民共和国成立后，中国共产党废除了民族压迫制度，宣布中国各民族不论大小一律平等。一切对少数民族侮辱性的称谓、碑碣和匾联，包括前面提到的少数民族名称的侮辱性偏旁，明令一律禁止。这件事，现在的许多年轻人可能都不甚了了。但了解这一点是重要的，它从一个侧面反映了中国民族关系史的一个重大变迁。
    再就是实现自治。中国各少数民族的区域自治，也是在这40年间实现的。经过40年的努力，现在，我国已建立154个民族自治地方（包括5个自治区，30个自治州，119个自治县），55个少数民族中，除10个人口较少的少数民族外，有45个实现了区域自治，实行自治的民族人口占少数民族总人口的64％。此外，作为民族区域自治的补充形式，全国已建立1400多个民族乡。党的十一届三中全会以来，民族区域自治的法制建设得到加强，建国以来也是中国历史上第一部《民族区域自治法》已公布实施，与之相配套的法制建设工作也已逐步展开。
    实行民族区域自治是中国共产党人解决国内民族问题的一大创造，是唯一适合中国国情的正确选择。今天，在有人进行分裂祖国的鼓噪的情况下，强调一下认识国情的重要性是必要的。历史的发展，使我国少数民族与汉族及少数民族之间形成了大杂居、小聚居和交错聚居的分布局面。由于自然条件等原因，在汉族地区与少数民族地区之间，在不同少数民族地区之间，存在着长期形成的经济分工和经济交换，存在着各民族在经济上的相互依存、不可分离的关系。在文化上，各民族也是互相吸收、彼此丰富，我中有你，你中有我。这种情况使各民族间形成了一种凝聚力，特别是在遇到外侮时，这种凝聚力表现得更强。在近代，中国国力日衰，国际气候对中国也十分不利，帝国主义列强为了瓜分中国，对各民族一直采取各个击破、分而治之的策略，在少数民族中策动所谓“民族独立”。第二次世界大战后，世界的格局发生了变化，但国际资本主义势力分裂中国的企图没有改变。近年来西藏拉萨发生的骚乱事件就是证明。这类分裂活动虽然打着“民族独立”的旗号，但同国际资本主义势力仍有着千丝万缕的联系。严峻的事实证明，我国各民族被分裂危险并未过去，所面临的选择是两个：要么被各个击破，成为资本主义的殖民地或附庸；要么依靠各民族团结的力量战胜资本主义的进攻，求得统一图存、共同发展繁荣。我们只有后一种选择。民族区域自治制度的确立，正是从我国的实际出发的，是历史的必然，是各族人民的选择。
    第三、就是先进民族对后进民族的帮助。马列主义的民族平等观还要求胜利了的先进民族的无产阶级要“以对待自己的不平等来抵偿生活上实际形成的不平等。”这是40年来我们党和国家处理民族问题的一个指导原则。它集中体现在《民族区域自治法》等法律、法规及规章中。在这一原则指导下，无论在政治、经济、文化等方面，对少数民族有许多照顾和优惠政策，如在对少数民族的招工、招干、招生乃至计划生育上都有照顾，而这对比较先进的民族来说，许多方面是享受不到的。
    当然，在我们这样一个多民族的大国里，彻底解决民族问题还有许多事情要作，还要走很长的路，但回顾这40年的历程，我们可以自豪地说：我们已经找到了一条中国式的解决民族问题的道路。
