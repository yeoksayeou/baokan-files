To come across a book that can both relax the mind and offer insights in a lighthearted manner is not just a pleasure but a stroke of luck. Wen Yuanning’s “Half-Baked” (a volume in the “Phoenix Series,” published by Yuelu Press) is precisely this kind of book. Reading it is like a stroll through a spring landscape, but it leaves you with lingering thoughts.

The book contains impressions of seventeen individuals, including Wu Mi, Hu Shi, and Xu Zhimo. These impressions are like seventeen vivid portraits, seventeen frames of life sketches rich in depth, and seventeen concise, elegantly written literary essays. Reading “Half-Baked” is not a chore; it avoids the dryness and artificiality that can make reading a burden. Instead, it invites you to smile genuinely as you wander through the pages, immersed in the profound wisdom and keen insights that exude humor and a deep love for life. Closing the book, you can’t help but recall “the eternal child” Xu Zhimo, the “born rebel” Guo Hongming, and Liang Qichao, who never hid his ordinary “true self.” You especially remember Wu Mi’s “painful smile” and his neat, empty rooms at Tsinghua University, with curtains drawn low, facing a beautiful wilderness. You also recall the vibrant Liang Zongdai, who “loved life with all his heart. For him, living was like being in heaven.”

“Half-Baked” is like aged grape wine; it doesn’t make you dizzy or overly excited. It simply lets you, in the warm April sunshine and gentle spring breeze, observe the kaleidoscope of life. Your heart, like a tranquil lake, feels neither the despair of an unsatisfying life nor the pity for others who live too hard. The world is composed of people in all shapes and forms. Why not try a beautiful way of living? Perhaps life will become more wonderful and colorful? The author, Wen Yuanning, taught at Peking University in the 1930s, immersing himself in Western culture. A “foreign gentleman” writing about his Chinese friends naturally has a unique charm, but without a translator’s refined, delicate, and elegant pen, this charm would be hard to preserve.

The historical and literary value of “Half-Baked” can be discussed by those who specialize in its study. I only hope that this book can somewhat change the current trend of essays that are “not like a walk, but like embroidery… using language whose meaning is unclear, to express thoughts that are not clear.”

    妙趣横生的人物剪影
    ——读《一知半解》
    易木玲
    能够得到一本既能松弛神经，又能于轻松中有所获的书，那不止是享受简直是幸运。温源宁的《一知半解》（《凤凰丛书》一种，岳麓书社出版）就属这类读时如踏青赏景，读后却回味无穷的书。
    书中吴宓、胡适、徐志摩等十七个人的印象记，似十七幅妙趣横生的人物剪影，又似十七帧内涵深邃的生活素描，更是十七篇言简意赅、笔调优美、风格典雅的文学散文。读《一知半解》没有难耐的干涩，反胃的矫揉，它只是让你挂着由衷的微笑，神游于字里行间那由深沉的智慧和洞察力而溢出幽默、由挚爱人生而流露的情理之中。合上书本，忍不住还要想起“永远不会长成大人”的徐志摩，“天生的叛逆人物”辜鸿铭，不掩藏平凡“本来面目”的梁遇春……尤其要想起吴宓先生“那十分痛苦的微笑和清华园里他那干净整齐的、空空落落的几个房间，那些窗子帘幕低垂，对着一片美好的野景”，还有生气勃勃的梁宗岱，“热爱人生，热爱得要命。对于他，活着就是上了天堂。”《一知半解》有如陈年葡萄美酒，不至把人弄得疯疯颠颠、狂喜暴忧，它只不过使你好像在四月野外的草地上，在和煦的阳光、徐拂的春风里观看人生的万花筒，暖暖的心如一湖宁静的水，没有因自己活得不满意的颓丧，也没有为别人活得太累的惋惜——世界就是千姿万态的人组成的。何妨选取一种美好的生活方式尝试尝试，或许人生会变得更美妙多彩些？此书的作者温源宁30年代曾在北京大学任教，浸淫西方文化，“洋绅士”写他熟悉的中国朋友，自然别有怡人的风味，但若译者没有一支精炼、委婉、清丽的笔，这风味也就难以保持了。
    《一知半解》的文史价值有专门从事研究的人们去评议，我只希望：此书能使序文中所说的当前那些“不是像散步，而是像绣花……用自己也不知其确义的语言，表达并无明确意思的意思”的散文风格能够多少改变一下。
