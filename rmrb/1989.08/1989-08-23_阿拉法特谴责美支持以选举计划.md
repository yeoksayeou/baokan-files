Arafat Denounces U.S. Support for Israeli Election Plan

	Xinhua News Agency, Amman, August 22 - Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee Yasser Arafat, in a press conference held after concluding his two-day visit to Jordan, strongly condemned the U.S. support for Israel's peace plan to resolve the Palestinian issue.

	He accused the U.S. government of ignoring the Palestinian people's initiative for peace, which calls for the establishment of a permanent Palestinian state in the occupied territories.

	The PLO has rejected Israel's peace plan, but the U.S. government has been attempting to persuade the PLO to accept the plan in previous rounds of U.S.-PLO talks.

	Arafat reiterated the conditions for accepting the election plan in the occupied territories: the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the elections must be held under international supervision, and the elections must lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

    阿拉法特谴责美支持以选举计划
    新华社安曼8月22日电  巴勒斯坦解放组织执委会主席阿拉法特今天在结束对约旦的两天访问后举行的记者招待会上，强烈谴责美国支持以色列的关于解决巴勒斯坦问题的和平计划。
    他指责美国政府对巴勒斯坦人要求在被占领土建立永久的巴勒斯坦国的和平倡议置若罔闻。
    巴解组织拒绝接受以色列的和平计划，但美国政府在先前几轮美巴对话中，一直企图劝说巴解接受以计划。
    阿拉法特再次重申了接受在被占领土选举计划的条件：以军撤出被占领土，选举必须在国际监督下举行，选举必将导致建立独立的巴勒斯坦国。
