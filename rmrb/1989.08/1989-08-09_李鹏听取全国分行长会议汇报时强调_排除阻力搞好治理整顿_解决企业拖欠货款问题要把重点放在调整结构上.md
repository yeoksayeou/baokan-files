	Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, and Vice Premier Yao Yilin today listened to the report of the meeting of the heads of the branches of the People's Bank of China. Li Peng emphasized that the policy of rectification and adjustment should not be opposed to reform and opening up. Rectification and adjustment is to create better conditions for reform and opening up, and in the process of rectification and adjustment, we must continue to reform and open up. Therefore, we must overcome obstacles and carry out rectification and adjustment with a clear conscience.

	Li Peng said that the three main goals of rectification and adjustment this year are to stabilize prices, strive for a good harvest in agriculture, and alleviate the imbalance between total supply and total demand. Looking at the first seven months, the work of rectification and adjustment has achieved remarkable results in some aspects and is not ideal in others. Price stabilization has been relatively good. Although the price level in the first seven months this year is still relatively high compared to the same period last year, the new factors causing price increases this year have significantly decreased, and the price increase of basic living materials for the masses is relatively small, with some places showing a trend of stability and slight decrease. He said that in the future, our focus on stabilizing prices will be on basic living materials for the middle and lower-income levels.

	Li Peng said that the less than ideal aspects are that the scale of construction has not yet met the planned requirements, especially in July, some places showed a trend of rebound; consumption funds are still rising, far exceeding the growth rate of the national economy.

	Li Peng said that in the national economy, the position and role of banks are very important. In the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the broad masses of workers in the banking system stood their posts and ensured the normal progress of economic construction and the normal needs of people's lives. This year, the banking system's policy of tightening credit has played an important role in rectification and adjustment, but the task is far from completed. This policy must continue to be implemented without wavering. Currently, some enterprises have serious problems with overdue payments. To solve this problem, the focus should be on structural adjustment, especially to solve the funding needs of large and medium-sized backbone enterprises. The experience of Tianjin and Dalian, where the local government took the lead in organizing enterprises to solve the problem of mutual arrears in the region, is very good and worth learning from. The issuance of start-up funds should not just focus on the bank, but mainly on tapping the existing financial potential of all parties.

	When talking about the problem of funds for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, Li Peng said that we have always attached great importance to this issue. This summer's grain procurement, through the joint efforts of all levels, basically did not issue "white receipts" to farmers. At present, the growth of autumn grain is good, and a bumper harvest is in sight. All levels of government and banking departments must do everything possible to organize the procurement of autumn grain and the required funds, and strive to complete the procurement task.

	Regarding the cleaning up and rectification of financial companies, Li Peng said that from the level of China's economic development, there is no need for so many financial companies. Therefore, the cleaning up of companies should be decisive in attitude and steady in steps. For companies that need to be merged, we must do a good job to prevent the loss of funds.

	During the reporting process, Vice Premier Yao Yilin also made an important speech.

    李鹏听取全国分行长会议汇报时强调
    排除阻力搞好治理整顿
    解决企业拖欠货款问题要把重点放在调整结构上
    本报北京8月9日讯　本报记者施明慎、新华社记者陈芸报道：国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林今天在中南海听取了中国人民银行全国分行长会议的汇报。李鹏强调指出，不要把治理整顿的方针和改革开放对立起来，治理整顿是为改革开放创造更好的条件，在治理整顿中还要进一步改革开放。因此，我们要排除阻力，理直气壮地进行治理整顿。
    李鹏说，今年治理整顿要达到的三个主要目标是：稳定物价、争取农业有个较好收成、总供给与总需求不平衡的矛盾有所缓解。纵观1至7月，治理整顿工作有些方面成绩显著，有些方面不够理想。稳定物价做得比较好，尽管前7个月物价与去年同期相比仍保持较高的上涨水平，但今年新增的涨价因素显著下降，群众基本生活资料的价格增长幅度较小，有些地方稳中有降。他说，今后我们稳定物价的重点是中等以下生活水平所需的基本生活资料。
    李鹏说，不够理想的是压缩基建规模离计划要求还有相当距离，特别是7月份有些地方出现回升趋势；消费基金仍在上涨，较大地超过了国民经济的增长速度。
    李鹏说，在国民经济中，银行的地位和作用十分重要。在平息反革命暴乱中，银行系统广大职工坚守岗位，保证了经济建设正常进行和人民生活的正常需要。今年银行实行紧缩银根的方针，对治理整顿起到了重要的作用，但任务还远远没有完成。这一方针要继续坚持下去，不能有丝毫动摇。当前有部分企业拖欠货款问题比较严重，解决这个问题要把重点放在调整结构上，特别是解决大中型骨干企业的资金需要。天津、大连等市由地方政府出面，组织企业解决本地区相互拖欠款的经验很好，值得各地学习。发放启动资金，不能光把眼睛盯在银行身上，主要是挖掘各方面现有的资金潜力。
    谈到农副产品收购资金问题时，李鹏说，这个问题我们历来十分重视。今年夏粮收购经过上上下下共同努力，基本上没有给农民打“白条”。目前秋粮长势良好，丰收在望，各级政府和银行部门要千方百计组织好秋粮收购及所需资金，争取完成收购任务。
    关于清理整顿金融公司，李鹏说，从我国经济发展水平看不需要那么多金融公司，因此清理公司一是态度要坚决，二是步子要稳妥，对需要撤并的公司，要做好工作防止资金流失。
    在汇报过程中，姚依林副总理也作了重要讲话。
