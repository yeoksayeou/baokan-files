The long-term concern of rapid price increases has now been effectively controlled in Heilongjiang Province.

Statistics from the price department show that the province's price increase rate in May dropped from 27.6% in January to 19.6%, and further decreased by 3 percentage points in June to 16.2%, which is significantly lower than the national price increase rate last year.

The reporter learned from the national price work conference held here that Heilongjiang Province's measures to control prices are as follows: the provincial party committee and government poured several buckets of "cold water" on the price increase trend.

The first bucket of "cold water" was to use modern scientific theories to adjust the industrial structure, cutting off the production of high-energy-consuming, low-efficiency, oversupplied, and less closely related to people's lives products; for 383 products that have a significant impact on economic development and people's lives, they provided priority guarantees in terms of funds, raw materials, energy, transportation, and circulation channels to ensure effective market supply.

The second bucket of "cold water" was to simplify circulation links, reduce intermediary speculation, and abolish or merge more than 1,400 companies. At the same time, focusing on hardware, electrical appliances, chemicals, knitting, department stores, and high-end durable consumer goods, they canceled some unnecessary wholesale enterprises.

The third bucket of "cold water" was for government departments to work together to rectify the market, crack down on monopolistic and illegal behaviors, and handle more than 18,000 cases of violations and illegal activities, shutting down nearly 14,000 unlicensed operations.

In addition, they also reduced investment in ongoing projects by more than 700 million yuan, reduced group purchasing power by more than 20%, and reduced prices for more than 10,000 commodities.

The retail price index in Shanghai has been falling month by month since March, reaching 21.3% in June, and a situation of "stable prices, stable market, and stable public sentiment" is emerging.

Last year, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued a series of measures to rectify, regulate, tighten monetary policy, and strengthen price management, which effectively curbed the excessive expansion of consumption funds from a macro perspective. At the beginning of the year, the municipal commercial work conference clearly announced that 19 essential commodities for people's livelihood would not be price-controlled this year, and specific measures were formulated for the price control of 32 commodities and production and sales supervision of 51 commodities. This blocked the black channels of "official speculation" and "private speculation" in the circulation sector, fully played the role of state-owned commercial main channels, and significantly improved the enthusiasm of commercial departments in organizing goods. With sufficient goods supply, the number of goods on the shelves has significantly increased, consumers' "fear of price increases" has been alleviated, blind panic buying has been greatly reduced, and market pressure has been significantly eased.

"Eggplant for one jiao, cucumber for two jiao, tomatoes for three jiao, green peppers for four jiao, spending a few yuan is enough for a family of four to eat for a day!" Some residents in Jinan are satisfied with the recent drop in vegetable prices.

In the first half of this year, the growth rate of social retail prices in this city has been declining month by month, down 7.5% from the end of last year.

One important measure Jinan has taken to stabilize prices is to fully utilize the role of state-owned enterprises as the main channel in the market. They established a market supply coordination leading group, which, in addition to implementing exclusive sales for key commodities such as fertilizers, pesticides, plastic film, and color televisions, also maintains a certain scale of operations for ordinary commodities that are closely related to people's lives and have been liberalized. State-owned stores account for 50% and more than 20% of the total market supply of pork and vegetables, respectively. From late April to early June, due to the disruption caused by the turmoil, the pork market experienced fluctuations. At this time, the municipal food department released 2.5 million kilograms of stored pork at a price 15% lower than the agricultural market, effectively adjusting supply and demand and stabilizing prices.

    从严控制  措施有力
    黑龙江上海物价涨势回落
    济南发挥国营企业主渠道作用收效大
    本报哈尔滨8月2日电  记者武培真报道：长期令人忧心的物价上涨过猛势头，目前已在黑龙江省得到有效控制。
    从物价部门的统计数字看，这个省5月份的物价上涨幅度已由1月份的27.6％下跌到19.6％，6月份又下降3个百分点，达到16.2％，明显低于全国去年物价上涨的水平。
    记者从正在这里召开的全国物价工作会议上了解到，黑龙江省控制物价的“招数”是，省委、省政府向涨价的势头狠狠泼了几瓢“冷水”。
    第一瓢“冷水”是运用现代科学理论调整产业结构，对耗能高、效益差、供过于求和与人民生活关系不十分密切的产品生产釜底抽薪，限产、停产；对经济发展和人民生活影响较大的383种产品，则从资金、原料、能源、运输和流通渠道诸方面给予重点保障，确保对市场的有效供给。
    第二瓢“冷水”是简化流通环节，减少中间盘剥，撤销、合并了1400多个公司。同时，以五金、交电、化工、针纺、百货及高档耐用消费品为重点，将一些不必要的批发企业取消。
    第三瓢“冷水”是政府各有关部门协同作战，整顿市场，打击欺行霸市等不法行为，查处违章违法案件18000多起，取缔无照经营近14000人。
    此外，他们还压缩在建项目投资7亿多元，压缩集团购买力20％以上，对一万多种商品进行降价让利销售。
    本报上海8月2日电　上海零售物价指数从3月份起逐月回落，6月份下降到21.3％，正在出现“物价稳、市场稳、人心稳”的局面。
    去年下半年，上海市政府接连出台的治理、整顿、收紧银根和加强物价管理等措施，从宏观上抑制了消费基金的过度膨胀。年初的市商业工作会议，明确宣布19种人民生活必需品今年不涨价，并规定了对32种商品实行专控和51种商品实行产销监控的具体措施，堵塞了流通领域“官倒”“私倒”的黑渠道，国营商业主渠道作用得以充分发挥，商业部门组织货源的积极性大为提高。货源充足，上柜商品明显增多，消费者的“恐涨”心理得到缓解，盲目抢购现象大为减少，显著减轻了市场压力。
    本报济南8月2日电　记者贾建舟报道：“一角钱的茄子，两角钱的黄瓜，三角钱的西红柿，四角钱的青椒，花上块把钱足够4口之家吃一天了！”济南市一些居民对近来蔬菜价格不断下跌表示满意。
    今年上半年，这个市社会零售物价增长幅度逐月回落，比去年年末下降7.5％。
    济南市平抑物价的一个重要措施，就是充分发挥国营企业在市场中的主渠道作用。他们成立了市场供应协调领导小组，除对化肥、农药、地膜及彩色电视机等重点商品实行专营外，对已经放开的与群众生活密切相关的普通商品，国营企业也保持一定的经营规模。国营商店经销的猪肉和蔬菜，分别占市场供应总量的50％和20％以上。4月下旬到6月上旬，因动乱造成的运输困难，猪肉市场一度发生波动，这时，市食品部门以低于农贸市场15％左右的价格，投放库存猪肉250万公斤，有效地调节了供求，平抑了物价。
