In the Jinan Military Region's certain army group, the former brigade commander Zhang Zhixin is renowned as a "modern-day Yugong." His moving deeds of dedicating himself to the Party's interests and working tirelessly for over 40 years are widely praised within and outside the military camp.

In June 1983, Zhang Zhixin retired. He faced the choice of how to spend his later years.

"Wuhan Retirement Home has allocated you a new four-bedroom apartment. It's much better to live in a big city!"

"You have dedicated your life to the revolution, and your only son also sacrificed himself in the southern border. You should enjoy some peace and quiet."

After careful consideration, Zhang Zhixin resolutely expressed to the brigade Party committee: he wanted to learn from Yugong and strive unceasingly, not to become a non-resident and waste his remaining years. From then on, Zhang Zhixin became like an ever-ticking clock, diligently doing every task, big or small, to the best of his ability.

That autumn, the military farm had a bountiful rice harvest. Despite his old age and frail health, Zhang Zhixin carried a backpack and water bottle, leading the troops to rush the harvest. He worked from dawn till dusk every day, toiling alongside the officers and soldiers. A superior leader came to inspect the work and saw Zhang Zhixin wearing a large straw hat, busily moving about on the drying ground. He couldn't help but recall the days when Zhang led the troops through wind and cold, battling the scorching sun, fighting the Yellow River plains, and creating ten thousand acres of fertile land. He praised, "The spirit of hard work is like Zhang Zhixin's shadow, following him wherever he goes."

In the autumn of 1985, Zhang Zhixin was hired by the brigade as the chief consultant for the production and operation office. Zhang Zhixin knew that this position, though not high-ranking, involved a pioneering and meaningful endeavor. By the end of the year, he led relevant personnel to climb mountains and explore valleys, investigating and discussing the plan to build a coal mine. After a month of repeated investigations and discussions, the plan to build a coal mine was abandoned. He then proposed the plan to build a cement factory. However, the funds for building the factory were severely insufficient.

Faced with difficulties, Zhang Zhixin did not falter. He boarded an old jeep and visited nearby cement factories one by one to learn from their experiences, finally finding solutions for fundraising and substituting local materials for imported ones. The brigade immediately decided: build the cement factory!

On the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month, while families were busy with the New Year, Zhang Zhixin led nearly a hundred workers to the remote foothills of the Taihang Mountains to start construction. Five months later, the factory buildings were erected, machinery was delivered, and the electricity quota was approved. However, Zhang Zhixin, due to overwork, suffered from pericarditis and pyelonephritis and was transferred to the Qingdao Sanatorium for treatment.

On the sickbed, Zhang Zhixin was restless, unable to erase the image of the cement factory from his mind. Before his illness was fully cured, he insisted on being discharged.

Upon returning to the cement factory, his legs were still swollen and shiny. He used a stick to walk from the stone material plant to the workshop, and then from the workshop to the laboratory. He dragged his sick body around for two months, timely solving the staffing issues of the cement factory, implementing the contract responsibility system, and opening up the market for the products, finally achieving the goal of building the factory and making a profit in the same year.

Over the years, Zhang Zhixin, with his unyielding entrepreneurial spirit and scientific and meticulous investigations, personally established 4 key enterprises for the brigade and pioneered a new path for military enterprise management.

The brigade became prosperous and famous! Zhang Zhixin, however, was left with a body full of ailments but gained the joy of an entrepreneur.

Zhang Zhixin worked "overload," but his life was quite frugal.

When going out to handle factory business, he often led his entourage to eat big bowls of noodles on the street and stay in rooms for four. Someone said he lacked "modern" awareness. Zhang Zhixin seriously refuted, "Wasting national money is a spendthrift."

In terms of work benefits, Zhang Zhixin never competed for higher positions or complained about lower ones. He saved wherever he could and did not let the public spend money on things that could be managed. When applying for the electricity quota for the cement factory, Zhang Zhixin's car stopped in front of the provincial government gate. The guard, seeing his old car, did not let him in. He walked in and found the relevant personnel, then sat in the hallway for two days until the provincial leaders saw his old military uniform and graying temples, moved, and said: "Old comrade, it's because of your sense of responsibility that we will squeeze out some for you, no matter how tight our plans are."

In recent years, the brigade has established 10 key enterprises, with an annual total income of over 3 million yuan. Yet, he still lives in that dilapidated house. He often reminds his family: "You are the family of the brigade commander and must set a good example for all the families in the brigade."

In early 1979, Zhang Zhixin returned to his old unit from the Lu Xun Military Academy in Xinyang to serve as the brigade commander. At that time, his son Zhang Li had been serving in the brigade for two years. Before the troops set off for the southern border, someone advised him to transfer his son to his side or keep him as a reserve. Zhang Zhixin firmly refused. His son, carrying the hopes of his parents, joined the spearhead platoon of the main attack battalion. Later, in a skirmish, Zhang Li sacrificed himself to cover his comrades. The battalion leader felt guilty about the matter, but Zhang Zhixin said: "The brigade commander's son sacrificing himself is no different from the common people's son sacrificing himself."

Due to Zhang Zhixin's strict requirements, the whole family encourages and supports each other in their work, forming a revolutionary family tradition of united struggle and joint achievement. In his family of five, except for a 3-year-old grandson, the other four have been selected by the party branches of their respective units as party representatives and outstanding party members.

    不当寓公当“愚公”
    ——记共产党员、原某师师长张志信
    梁万魁
    在济南军区某集团军，某师原师长张志信被人们誉为“当代愚公”。他40多年时刻以党的利益为重，艰苦奋斗，无私奉献的动人事迹，在军营内外广为传颂。
    1983年6月，张志信离休了。他面临晚年生活的选择。
    “武汉干休所给你分了一套四室一厅的新房，到大城市多好！”
    “你为革命出生入死奋斗了一辈子，唯一的儿子也牺牲在南疆，应该享享清福了。”
    张志信经过深思熟虑，毅然向师党委表示：要学习愚公奋斗不已，不当寓公虚度残生。从此，张志信像一架永不停摆的挂钟，凡是能插上手的事情，不论大小，他都尽心尽力地干好。
    这年秋天，部队农场水稻丰收，张志信不顾年迈体弱，带上背包水壶，率领部队抢收。他每天起早睡晚，和干部战士一起苦干。一位上级领导同志前去检查工作，看到张志信戴着大草帽，在晒场上忙来忙去，不禁想起当年他带领部队顶风寒，战酷暑，大战黄河滩，营造万亩良田的场面，赞叹“艰苦奋斗像张志信的影子，走到哪里带到哪里”。
    1985年秋，张志信被师里聘为生产经营办公室总顾问。张志信深知，这个“官”不大，干的却是一项富有开创意义的事业。年底，他带领有关人员爬山头，钻深谷，勘察论证建煤窑方案，经过一个月反复勘察论证，建煤矿的方案给推翻了。他又拿出建水泥厂的方案。但是办厂资金严重不足。
    困难面前，张志信没有却步。他坐上一辆破吉普车，挨个到附近水泥厂取经，终于找到了集资和以土代洋的解决办法。师里立即拍板：上水泥厂！
    腊月二十八，家家户户忙过年，张志信却带着近百名民工，来到荒僻的太行山脚下，打钎放炮开始建厂。5个月后，厂房建起，机器运来，用电指标也已批下，可是张志信却因为过度劳累，患心包炎和肾盂肾炎，被转送到青岛疗养院治疗。
    病榻上的张志信如卧针毡，脑子里怎么也抹不掉水泥厂的影子。病未治好，他硬是出院了。
    回到水泥厂，他双腿仍肿得发亮，一按一个窝。他拄着一根棍子，从石料厂到车间，又从车间到化验室。他就这样拖着病体奔波了两个月，及时解决了水泥厂配备问题，推行了承包责任制，还打开了产品的销路，终于实现了当年建厂，当年盈利。
    几年中，张志信靠百折不挠的创业热情，科学周密地调查论证，亲手为师里办了4个骨干企业，并率先走出军队企业管理的新路。
    师里富了，出名了！张志信落下一身病，却得到了创业者的欢乐。
    张志信“超负荷”工作，可生活上却十分艰苦。
    外出联系办厂业务，他经常带领随行人员上街吃大碗面条，住4人的房间。有人说他没有“现代人”意识。张志信严肃地批驳说：“挥霍国家钱财，那是败家子”。
    在工作待遇上，张志信从不攀高比低，能俭省的就尽量俭省，能凑合用的就不让公家破费。申报水泥厂用电指标时，张志信的车到省府门前，门岗看他车破，不让进院，他就步行进去，从办事人员找到省领导，在走廊上一坐就是两天，有关领导看他一身旧军装，两鬓斑白，感动地说：老同志，就是冲你这种负责精神，我们计划再紧张，也要挤一点给你们。
    近几年，该师连办10个骨干企业，年总收益300多万元。可他还住在那年久失修的房子里。他常告诫家人：你们是师长的家属，要给全师的家属做出好样子。
    1979年初，张志信从信阳陆校返回老部队任师长，当时他儿子张黎已在该师当兵两年。部队开赴南疆前夕，有人劝他将儿子调到身边，或作为留后人员。张志信严辞拒绝。儿子带着父母的期望，来到主攻团的尖刀排。后来，在一次遭遇战中，张黎为掩护战友光荣牺牲。团领导为此事有些内疚，张志信说：“师长儿子牺牲和老百姓儿子牺牲没有什么两样”。
    由于张志信的严格要求，全家人工作上互相勉励，互相支持，形成了同心奋斗，共建功业的革命家风。他家5口人，除3岁的外孙外，其余4人均被所在单位的党支部选为党代表和优秀党员。
