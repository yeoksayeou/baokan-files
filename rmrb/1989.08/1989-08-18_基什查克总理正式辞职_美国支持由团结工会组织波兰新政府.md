Prime Minister Kiszczak Resigns
U.S. Supports New Polish Government Led by Solidarity

	WARSAW, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- According to the Polish News Agency, Polish Prime Minister Kiszczak submitted his resignation to Polish President Jaruzelski on August 17.

	Kiszczak, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, was appointed Prime Minister by the Polish Parliament on August 2. He stated in the parliament that he would consult with various parties, groups, and opposition leaders on the formation of the cabinet, aiming to "establish a grand coalition government." Solidarity leader Lech Walesa opposed Kiszczak's cabinet formation, advocating for a coalition government composed of Solidarity, the United Peasants' Party, and the Democratic Party, excluding the United Workers' Party. The United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, which had been governing with the United Workers' Party, expressed their acceptance of Walesa's proposal. Kiszczak submitted his resignation under this background.

	Jaruzelski met with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, United Peasants' Party Chairman Malinowski, and Democratic Party Chairman Jodlowiak on the same day to discuss issues related to the government crisis. According to Warsaw Television, Jaruzelski listened to their suggestions for a coalition government and agreed to "consult with representatives of various parties and groups and make a decision as soon as possible."

	WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- White House spokesman Fitzwater today said that President Bush "encourages and supports" Poland's process of democratization, but believes the U.S. should not intervene more directly in this matter.

	Fitzwater said that President Bush's support for Poland's current political reform process is undeniable. However, Fitzwater did not make further comments on Poland's current situation.

    基什查克总理正式辞职
    美国支持由团结工会组织波兰新政府
    新华社华沙8月17日电（记者汤德乔）据波通社报道，波兰政府总理基什查克17日在致波兰总统雅鲁泽尔斯基的信中正式提出辞职。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员基什查克是8月2日被波兰议会任命为政府总理的。他在议会上表示，他将与各党派、团体和反对派负责人协商组阁事宜，“争取建立一个大联合政府”。团结工会主席瓦文萨反对基什查克组阁，主张由团结工会、统一农民党和民主党建立排除统一工人党的联合政府。一直与统一工人党联合执政的统一农民党和民主党表示接受瓦文萨的建议。基什查克是在这种背景下提出辞呈的。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基于当天接见团结工会主席瓦文萨、统一农民党主席马利诺夫斯基和民主党主席尤季维亚克，商谈与政府危机有关的问题。据华沙电视台报道，雅鲁泽尔斯基听取了他们关于联合组阁的建议，并答应将“同各党派和团体代表商讨，尽早作出决定”。
    新华社华盛顿8月17日电  美国白宫发言人菲茨沃特今天表示，布什总统“鼓励和支持”波兰的多元化进程，但认为美国不应在这个问题上以更直接的形式介入。
    菲茨沃特说，布什总统对波兰目前政治改革的进程的支持是不容置疑的。但是，菲茨沃特没有对波兰目前的局势作进一步的评论。
