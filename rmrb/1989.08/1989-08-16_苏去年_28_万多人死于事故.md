The Soviet newspaper Pravda revealed on August 14 that approximately 287,000 people died in the Soviet Union last year due to industrial accidents, traffic accidents, and poisoning. This number is equivalent to the population of a medium-sized city.

The Soviet Union has long winters with heavy snowfall, and the snow is not cleared in a timely manner, causing many people to slip and fall while walking, resulting in injuries that require hospitalization or even death. Alcoholism is another major cause of frequent traffic accidents. Last year, 9,000 pedestrians were killed by drunk drivers, and 1,600 drunk individuals died under the wheels of vehicles.

Some Soviet citizens have poor work discipline and do not follow traffic rules, which is also a reason for the increase in casualties.

    苏去年28万多人死于事故
    苏联《真理报》14日透露，去年苏联约有28.7万人死于工伤、交通事故和中毒，这相当于一座中等城市的人口。
    苏联冬季多冰雪，清扫又不及时，不少人走路时滑倒而受伤住院，甚至死亡。酗酒是交通事故频仍的另一主要原因。去年被酒醉司机轧死的行人就达9000名，还有1600名醉汉葬身车轮下。
    一些苏联人劳动纪律差，不守交通规则，这也是伤亡事故上升的原因之一。
