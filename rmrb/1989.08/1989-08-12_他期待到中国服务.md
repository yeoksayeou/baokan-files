He Looks Forward to Serving in China

Yan Zheng

Koper is a small coastal town in northern Yugoslavia. Its clear blue sky and sea, the green mountains, and the beautiful buildings nestled among fragrant grass and lush forests often stir my thoughts. However, what I miss the most is a Yugoslav friend who has been deeply enamored with Chinese and has endured over a decade of "hard study"—Milan Stranšičak. He is a nearly 40-year-old high school German teacher.

Taking advantage of a business trip, I once visited him with a Yugoslav sinologist. Since we had not contacted him in advance, our sudden arrival made him pause for a moment. But when he realized who we were, he became extremely excited, repeatedly saying, "Wonderful, welcome, welcome, please come in." His Mandarin was so pure that it made me, a Chinese person who has long lived abroad, feel very close, as if I were meeting an old friend. His mother brought out a plate of cherries freshly picked from the tree, as well as various pastries, candies, and drinks. Stranšičak introduced them one by one in Chinese, naming their origins and flavors. His pronunciation and vocabulary were so precise that I was amazed: how did he manage to master Chinese to such a level?

It all started about 10 years ago. The implementation of China's reform and opening-up policy opened a window for Stranšičak to learn about China. China's long history, ancient culture, beautiful landscapes, and hardworking people—all of these deeply attracted him. To be able to read firsthand materials and gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of China, he decided to learn Chinese on his own. Although he was a teacher proficient in three languages, learning Chinese was no easy task! He borrowed Chinese books and self-study materials, first learned Pinyin, then used the Xinhua Dictionary to master the pronunciation of Chinese characters, and used a Chinese-English dictionary to understand their meanings. With a tenacious spirit, he managed to memorize one Chinese character after another. After memorizing a certain number of characters, he practiced listening and speaking by following Chinese radio broadcasts. For over a decade, he has persisted in self-studying Chinese, often staying up all night. To concentrate without distractions, he moved out of his wife and daughter's home and into a small villa on the mountain where his mother lived, leading a hard life of "ignoring worldly affairs and focusing on studying Chinese."

His efforts paid off, and Stranšičak's Chinese proficiency improved rapidly. Now he can not only read general Chinese newspapers and magazines but has also begun to study classical Chinese.

Having a common language allows for the exchange of thoughts and feelings. As we chatted, the atmosphere became increasingly warm, with none of the initial awkwardness of meeting for the first time. He then took out a copy of "People's Literature" and pointed out a typo, saying, "There are still quite a few typos in your newspapers and magazines!" Perhaps he noticed the embarrassed look on my face, so he stood up and poured me a glass of grape wine. A thought flashed through my mind: I might as well test him. I asked, "What are the different ways to say 'offer a drink to a guest'?" He thought for a moment and said, "There's pouring a drink and offering a toast." The sinologist added, "You can also use 'encourage drinking.'" "Are there any more?" I asked. After careful consideration, he wrote the character "斟" on a piece of paper. "That's right, there's also the word 'pour a drink,'" he exclaimed with joy. We all laughed heartily. In the excitement, I was puzzled: why would a foreigner far from China be so fascinated with Chinese? What force drove him to spend so much effort learning it? When I asked him this question in a roundabout way, Stranšičak was silent for a moment, then said excitedly, "I love great China and want to go there to serve. I believe that China's reform and opening-up will deepen further and will definitely need more foreign language talents. I can go there to teach foreign languages, continue to study Chinese, and research China." Stranšičak is proficient in English, Italian, and especially German. His brother in West Germany has introduced him to work there several times, but he has declined his brother's good intentions to wait for the opportunity to serve in China. He believes that this opportunity will come. Hearing his words, we were all moved. When I left Koper, the accompanying Yugoslav sinologist repeatedly reminded me not to forget to find opportunities for Stranšičak, so that his long-cherished wish could be realized. I also sincerely hope that one day I can meet Stranšičak again on my own soil.

    他期待到中国服务
    严正
    科佩尔是南斯拉夫北部的海滨小城，她那澄蓝一色的海天，黛绿的山影以及座落在芳草秀林中的美丽建筑不时勾起我的情思，然而最使我怀念的是，那里有一位深深地迷上中文、并为之历尽了10多年“寒窗”之苦的南斯拉夫朋友——米兰·斯特兰什查克。他是一位年近40的中学德文教师。
    利用出差机会，我曾与一位南斯拉夫汉学家同去拜访过他。由于事前未能联系上，我们的突然来到，使他愣了一下，但当他明白过来后，又变得兴奋异常，连连说：“太好了，欢迎，欢迎，请里边坐。”竟是一口纯正的普通话，使我这个长期生活在异国他乡的中国人倍感亲切，像是见到了老朋友。他母亲端来一盘刚从树上摘下来的樱桃，还有各种糕点、糖果、饮料……斯特兰什查克又用汉语一一介绍它们的名称、产地和味道，其发音之准，用词之恰当使我惊奇万分：他究竟是通过什么途径掌握中文，并达到如此水平的？
    说起来还是10年前的事，我国改革开放政策的实施为斯特兰什查克打开了认识中国的窗口。中国悠久的历史、古老的文化、锦绣的河山、勤劳的人民……所有这一切都深深地吸引着他。为了能够直接阅读第一手资料，全面深刻地了解中国，他决心自学中文。他虽然是一个精通三国语文的教师，但真要自学汉语，谈何容易！他借来了中文书籍和自学材料，先学会汉语拼音，然后通过新华字典掌握汉字的读音，又通过汉英字典了解字意，凭着一股子顽强精神，硬是将“石块”似的汉字一个又一个地啃进肚里。当记住了一定数量的汉字后，他就跟着中文广播练习听说能力。10多年来，他天天坚持自学汉语，常常通宵达旦。为了集中精力不受干扰，他与妻子女儿分开居住，独自搬进山上他母亲的一幢小别墅里，过着“两耳不问窗外事，一心攻读中文书”的艰苦生活。功夫不负有心人，斯特兰什查克的汉语水平提高很快，现在他不但能够阅读一般的中文报刊杂志，而且又开始自学古汉语了。
    有了共同的“语言”就能沟通思想和感情。我们边谈边聊，气氛越来越亲切，丝毫没有初次见面那种陌生和拘束感。这时他又拿出一本《人民文学》，指出了其中的错别字，并说“你们报刊上的错别字还不少哩！”也许他看到了我脸上的羞色，就站起来亲自为我倒了一杯葡萄酒。我脑子里闪过一个念头：不妨也考考他。就问道：“请客人喝酒有几种说法？”他想了想说：“有倒酒、敬酒，”汉学家补充说：“也可用劝酒。”“还有没有呢？”我问。经过认真的思索后，他在纸上写了个“斟”字，“对了，还有一个词叫斟酒。”他高兴得大声喊了起来。我们几个人也都痛快地大笑起来。在兴奋之余，我又迷惘了，一个远离中国的普普通通的外国人，为什么会对中文如此着迷？究竟是什么力量驱使他花费巨大的精力去攻读？当我以婉转的方式提出这个问题时，斯特兰什查克沉默片刻，然后很激动地说，我爱伟大的中国，想到中国去服务。我相信中国的改革开放一定会更加深入，肯定需要更多的外语人才。我可以去那里教外文，同时继续深造汉语，研究中国。斯特兰什查克懂得英文、意大利文，特别擅长德文，他哥哥在西德，曾几次想介绍他去那里工作，但他为了等待到中国服务的机会，回绝了哥哥的好意。他认为这个机会一定会到来的。听了他的话，我们都很感动。当我离开科佩尔时，那位陪同的南斯拉夫汉学家一再叮嘱我不要忘了给斯特兰什查克寻找机会，使他的宿愿得以实现。我也衷心期待有一天能在自己的国土上与斯特兰什查克重逢。
