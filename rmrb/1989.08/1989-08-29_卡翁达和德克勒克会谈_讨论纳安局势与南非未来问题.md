President Kaonda of Zambia held a two-hour meeting with South African Acting President De Klerk today in Livingstone, where they agreed to continue dialogue to end conflicts in Southern Africa and promote peace and cooperation in the region.

De Klerk arrived in Livingstone, a city on the southern border of Zambia, on the morning of the 28th to discuss with Kaonda the paths to reform and eliminate the apartheid system.

Both leaders described the meeting as "very beneficial," saying it helped them better understand each other.

In a joint press conference after the meeting, Kaonda and De Klerk said they discussed the process of Namibian independence, the peace process in Angola, and the future of South Africa.

The two leaders agreed that the process of Namibian independence is on track and that there are no major disagreements on this issue.

They told reporters that they exchanged views on the situation in Angola and had an in-depth discussion on the peace process in Angola. They hope this meeting will contribute to peace in Angola.

However, De Klerk insisted in the press conference that the apartheid system is an internal matter of South Africa.

The press conference did not mention the issue of the African National Congress of South Africa. It is believed that this was one of the topics discussed.

De Klerk returned to his country this afternoon.

    他们告诉记者，双方就安哥拉局势交换了意见，并深入讨论了安哥拉的和平进程。他们希望这次会晤将有助于安哥拉的和平。
    然而，德克勒克在记者招待会上顽固地声称，种族隔离制度是南非的内政问题。
