Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th.

The State Statistical Bureau reported that based on the sampling and actual measurement of yields by agricultural survey teams in nine major early rice-producing provinces and regions—Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan—and the estimated production in five non-major early rice-producing provinces and municipalities—Shanghai, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan—this year's national early rice production is estimated to be 4,796 million tons. This is an increase of 94.7 million tons, or 2 percent, compared to last year.

The State Statistical Bureau believes the main reasons for the increase in early rice production are:

* Various levels of leadership have prioritized grain production;
* The sowing area has increased;
* The amount of fertilizer used for early rice has increased;
* Weather conditions have been favorable in most regions.

The State Statistical Bureau pointed out that this summer's wheat and early rice production has increased by 351 million tons compared to last year. To achieve the annual grain production target of 410 million tons, autumn grain production needs to increase by 1,250 million tons, which will be a significant challenge. Although the autumn grain planting area is expected to increase by about 10 million mu, currently, some regions are experiencing severe droughts, directly threatening the growth of autumn crops. All regions should strengthen the management of autumn crop production, improve yield per mu; supply the necessary materials for autumn grain production in a timely and quality-assured manner, especially to take early measures to prevent and control drought, flood, and pest damage, and strive to achieve agricultural abundance despite the challenges.

    全国早稻预计增产九十多万吨
    据新华社北京八月二十八日电　国家统计局提供的消息说，据浙江、安徽、福建、江西、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、海南九个早稻主产省、区农调队抽样实割实测推算及上海、江苏、四川、贵州、云南五个早稻非主产省市的产量预计，今年全国早稻产量为四千七百九十六万吨，比去年增产九十四点七万吨，增长百分之二。
    国家统计局认为，早稻增产的主要原因是：
    各级领导重视粮食生产；播种面积增加；早稻用肥投入量增加；大部分地区天气条件有利。
    国家统计局指出，今年夏粮、早稻比去年增产三百五十一万吨，要完成全年粮食生产四点一亿吨的计划，秋粮需增加一千二百五十万吨，难度是很大的。尽管秋粮面积预计增加一千万亩左右，但目前一些地区旱象严重，直接威胁着秋季农作物的生长。各地应加强对秋季农作物生产的管理，提高亩产水平；按质、按量、适时供应秋粮生产所需物资，特别要及早做好旱涝病虫害的防治，力争抗灾夺取农业丰收。
