Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 20th - The Guangdong Provincial Government has recently approved Guangzhou's housing system reform implementation plan, making Guangzhou the first provincial capital in China to implement housing reforms.

Guangzhou's housing system reform will proceed according to the principle of "starting with selling houses, gradually increasing rents, issuing corresponding subsidies, and implementing new systems for newly allocated housing." After nearly half a year of pilot testing, this approach has effectively addressed the current issues of affordability for the state, collectives, and individuals regarding housing reforms. The city will first organize the sale of public housing, encouraging employees to buy houses with various preferential policies. A one-time deduction of the house price will be implemented, and no monthly subsidies will be issued afterward.

Guangzhou will gradually reform the low-rent system and implement a phased increase in rents. The city will calculate rents based on a unified public housing rent standard, with the employer providing a 40% subsidy based on the rent amount. For housing areas exceeding the standard, the cost rent will be calculated without subsidy. Over the next few years, the city will gradually raise public housing rents to the cost rent level and then transition to market rents.

    广州住房改革方案实施
    卖房起步　分步提租　相应发贴  新分配住房实行新制度
    据新华社广州8月20日电  （记者顾万明）广东省政府最近批准了广州市的住房制度改革实施方案，广州市成为我国率先实行房改的省会城市。
    广州市的住房制度改革将按照“卖房起步，分步提租，相应发贴，新分配住房实行新制度”的办法进行。经近半年试点证明，这个办法较好地解决了当前国家、集体和个人对房改承受力的问题。全市首先组织出售公有住房，以多项优惠政策鼓励职工买房，实行一次性扣减房价，以后不再按月发给补贴。
    广州市将逐步改革低租金制，对住房实行分步提租。全市按统一的公房租金标准计租，由承租人所在单位按租金额补贴40％，对住房面积超标准的部分，则按成本租金计租，不给补贴。全市将在几年内分步将公房租金提高到成本租金的水平，然后向商品租金过渡。
