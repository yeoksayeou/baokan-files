There are more than 280 backyard oil refineries around the Jianghan Oilfield. Most of these refineries are run by villages or individuals. They buy crude oil from farmers at low prices and then sell low-quality diesel and machine oil at high prices. For example, in the Xingou Oilfield, which is at the border of the counties and cities of Qianjiang, Xiantao, and Jianli, there are fewer than 20 oil wells producing only 40 tons of crude oil per day. However, there are more than 40 backyard refineries in this area.

Some farmers unreasonably demand that the Jianghan Oilfield sell them crude oil, some steal scarce materials from the oilfield, and some brazenly bring oil barrels and wrenches to open the wells and steal oil. From January to May this year, the Jianghan Oilfield experienced 234 cases of oil theft, resulting in the shutdown of 221 oil wells and a reduction in crude oil production of more than 8,000 tons. In early April, the oilfield security team caught a gang of oil thieves. This gang had signed a contract with a local power station to supply 1,000 tons of crude oil over a year. They stole oil rampantly, and in one instance, they sold 105 tons of stolen oil, making a profit of 57,750 yuan.

    土法炼油泛滥　江汉油田遭灾
    江汉油田四周现有土炼油厂280多座。这些土炼油厂大都是由乡村兴办或个体经营的。他们从农民手中低价收购原油，然后生产出低劣柴油、机油高价出售。如潜江、仙桃、监利3县、市交界的新沟油田，油井不足20口，日产原油不过40吨，而这一带的土炼油厂竟有40多家。
    有的农民无理要求江汉油田出售原油，有的偷盗油田紧俏物资，有的明目张胆带着油桶和扳手开井放油。今年1至5月，江汉油田共发生盗抢原油案234起，造成油井停产221井次，原油减产8000多吨。4月初，油田护警抓获一盗油团伙。这伙人曾与某地方发电站签订一年内有偿提供1000吨原油的合同。他们偷盗原油猖獗，仅一次偷卖原油105吨，获利57750元。
