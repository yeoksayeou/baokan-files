In the early days of July 1989, the Huaying Mountain area of Sichuan Province experienced continuous heavy rainfall. At 1:40 PM on the 10th, 10 million cubic meters of mud and rocks suddenly slid down from an elevation of 805 meters on the middle section of Huaying Mountain. The mid-mountain village of Mazhuaping in Xikou Town, Huaying City, and the cement factory vehicle fleet, coal mine repair factory, and other six units at the foot of the mountain in Nanchong Region, along with 221 people and some buildings, were instantly engulfed by the mudslide.

In the moment of disaster, Zhou Xiaoping, a young worker from the Red Rock Coal Mine's extraction team, dashed out of his dormitory just as the mudslide was 10 meters away from his home. After running about 10 meters, he discovered a bloody head under a piece of precast concrete. In a split second, he found a broken water pipe, used one hand to lift the concrete slab, and the other to dig through the mud, rescuing a person who had been buried.

At that time, Zhang Cheng, the deputy squad leader of the Nanchong Region's Armed Police First Battalion, and soldiers Yang Tong, Lu Zhibiao, and Yu Yuanhui, who were eating in a cold drink shop in the town, rushed to the scene upon discovering the danger.

The second platoon of the armed police, who had just returned to the barracks from a rescue operation at the state-owned Lianyuan Factory, immediately assembled and rushed to the scene, covering 3 kilometers in 15 minutes. The third platoon, which was farther away, also rushed to the scene under the leadership of the battalion's officers. The 152 soldiers used their hands to dig, shoulders to carry, and heads to lift, rescuing over 80 tons of grain and oil, and 18 injured people.

After the landslide, Vice Minister of the State Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources Zhang Hongren, Vice Governor of Sichuan Province Xie Shijie, and leaders of the Nanchong Region, Kang Xianxi and Li Shenkuan, rushed to the scene to organize disaster relief and rescue efforts.

    大滑坡发生后
    1989年7月上旬，四川省华蓥山一带连降暴雨。10日下午1时40分，位于华蓥山中段的马鞍山上，100万立方米泥石突然从海拔805米处滑下。山腰的华蓥市溪口镇马鞍坪村和山脚的南充地区溪口水泥厂汽车队、川煤12处机修厂等6个单位的221人及一些建筑物，顿时被泥石流吞没。
    灾难发生的一瞬间，红岩煤矿回采队青年工人周小平，在泥石流距他家只有10米远时一个箭步冲出宿舍。刚跑过10多米，便发现一块混凝土预制板下有个血糊糊人头。他急中生智，找来了一根被冲断的水管，一手撬起预制板，一手在岩浆里用力地刨，救起了一位被压者。
    当时正在镇上冷饮店吃饭的南充地区武警支队一大队副班长张城和战士杨彤、鲁志标、余远水，发现险情，飞奔现场参加抢险。
    武警二中队刚从国营燎原厂抢险回到营房，一接到命令，马上紧急集合，用15分钟跑完了3公里路程赶到现场。距离较远的三中队在大队干部的带领下，也以最快速度赶来。152名官兵用手刨，用肩扛，用头顶，抢救出粮油80多吨、受伤群众18名。
    滑坡发生后，国家地矿部副部长张宏仁、四川省副省长谢世杰和南充地区领导康咸熙、李慎宽等，及时赶赴现场，组织救灾抢险。
