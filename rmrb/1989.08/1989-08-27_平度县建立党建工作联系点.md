The Standing Committee of the Pingdu County Committee in Shandong Province has established a system of Party building work contact points, focusing on strengthening Party construction. They have incorporated the investigation and research of grassroots Party building work at these contact points into the responsibility system of the county committee members, and made it an important part of their annual performance evaluation. At the same time, based on the current situation and development trends of grassroots Party building in the county, as well as the overall deployment of the county committee, they have carried out organizational construction pilot projects, summarized experiences, and guided the work across the board. The members of the Standing Committee of the County Committee also select their own research projects, which are organized and coordinated by the County Committee. Each year, they must write at least two investigative reports that have unique insights, clear viewpoints, in-depth analysis, and provide some guidance for Party building work.

The establishment of the Party building work contact points system by the Standing Committee of the Pingdu County Committee has achieved good results. First, it closely combines theory with practice, giving them the initiative in guiding grassroots Party building work. Second, it closely combines research with decision-making, ensuring that major decisions on grassroots Party building work are based on scientific and democratic foundations. Third, it closely combines reality with exploration, making the chessboard of grassroots Party organization building more dynamic.

    平度县建立党建工作联系点
    山东省平度县委常委建立党建工作联系点制度，聚精会神抓党的建设，把在联系点上开展基层党的建设的调查研究，纳入县委常委岗位责任制，并作为年终考核其工作实绩的一项重要内容。同时，根据全县基层党的建设现状和发展趋势以及县委的总体部署安排，进行组织建设工作试点，总结经验，指导面上工作。县委常委还自选调研项目，经县委统一组织、协调，每年至少写出两篇有独到见解、观点明确、分析透彻，对党建工作有一定指导作用的调查报告。
    平度县委常委建立党建工作联系点制度，取得了好效果。一是理论和实践紧密结合，掌握了指导基层党建工作的主动权；二是研究和决策紧密结合，使基层党建工作重大问题的决策建立在科学、民主的可靠基础上；三是现实和探索紧密结合，走活了基层党组织建设这盘棋。
