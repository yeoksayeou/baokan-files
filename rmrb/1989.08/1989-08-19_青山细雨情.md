Nagano Prefecture is located in central Japan, with an elevation higher than surrounding areas, earning it the nickname "the Roof of Japan." Green mountains embrace clear waters, and lakes and hot springs are scattered throughout. During the rainy season, clouds drift lazily between the mountains, and fine rain falls softly, adding a touch of mystery to the landscape.

Asking a local tourism official which place in Nagano Prefecture is most worth visiting, the answer was Shigaku-ji Temple, and a guide was arranged. This made me curious. Temples are common in Japan, so what makes Shigaku-ji Temple special? Following the guide, I went ahead.

Shigaku-ji Temple was established over 1,400 years ago and is famous for its long history, making it a top tourist attraction in the area. The host specially mentioned a new connection between Shigaku-ji Temple and China: a Chinese painter had recently completed a wall painting in one of the temple's halls. As far as I know, six years ago, the famous Japanese painter Tohaku Hasegawa created a wall painting for Todai-ji Temple, but this is the first time a Chinese painter's work has been displayed as a wall painting in a Japanese temple. The artist, Yang Yongqi, was born in Guangxi and is currently the director of the Guilin Art Academy.

The four sets of works, including "Scenic Guilin," "Winter Plum with Birds," "Lake of Cranes," and a calligraphy scroll, are all fresh and elegant, harmonizing beautifully with the temple's environment.

Apart from Shigaku-ji Temple, the people of Nagano Prefecture always talk about "mountains." With numerous mountains and forests covering nearly 80% of the prefecture's area, there are also many hot springs. A unique sight is the monkeys in the mountains taking hot spring baths in winter to keep warm.

In recent years, the mountains have brought greater economic benefits, especially during the winter skiing season. There are over 100 ski resorts in the prefecture, attracting about 3 million skiers each winter, accounting for approximately 50% of the annual tourists.

Currently, the most important event and hottest topic for the people of Nagano Prefecture is the 1998 Winter Olympics. After domestic selection, Nagano Prefecture has become a candidate to host the 1998 Winter Olympics. Although the event is still far off, locals eagerly greet everyone with "Please take care," and the Winter Olympics emblem has already been designed and produced, worn on chests and printed on business cards. It seems as if the Winter Olympics will open here tomorrow, showing their deep longing and anticipation. Someone asked me how many ski resorts and skiers there are in China, which really stumped me. They said that in recent years, Nagano Prefecture has been donating skiing equipment to China every year, inviting Chinese coaches to visit and study, and this winter, the prefecture will send a delegation to China for a visit and competition. Skiing is increasingly becoming a popular exchange between China and Japan.

When eating in Nagano Prefecture, locals first recommend "Shinshu noodles." "Shinshu" is the old name for this area. The noodles are made from buckwheat flour and served with a slightly spicy "Shinshu sauce," offering a unique flavor.

It is said that Nagano Prefecture was once a poor region, where buckwheat, which requires minimal cultivation, was widely planted, making buckwheat noodles the main staple for the locals. Today, with the economy highly developed, utilizing people's desire for individuality and local flavors, the inexpensive noodles have become a symbol of local tourism cuisine. It is also said that 70% of the buckwheat is imported from China.

Time passes quietly amidst the birdsong in the mountains. Between the green mountains and fine rain, we bid farewell to the people of Nagano Prefecture, feeling that the beautiful lakes and mountains are hard to forget, but the three major tourist attractions in Nagano Prefecture—Shigaku-ji Temple, skiing, and Shinshu noodles, and their deep connections with China, are even more vivid and memorable.

    青山细雨情
    于青
    长野县位于日本中部，海拔高于外县，有“日本屋脊”之称。青山环抱绿水穿绕，湖泊温泉星罗棋布。恰逢梅雨时节，山间白云飘飘悠悠，细雨潇潇洒洒，又为山水添了几分幽趣。
    问当地一位观光课长，长野县何处最值一看，答曰善光寺，并派人导游。不禁令我疑惑不解，寺庙日本随处可见，善光寺有何独到之处。客随主便，随之前往。
    善光寺创建于1400多年前，以历史悠久闻名，是当地首推的旅游项目。主人着意告我一条善光寺与中国有关的新事：一位中国画家以妙笔丹青于7月中制成该寺中一殿堂的障壁画。据我所知，6年前，日本著名画师东山魁夷曾为唐招提寺作障壁画，而中国画家的作品在日本寺庙中作成障壁画还是首次。作者杨永琚，出生广西，现为桂林艺芸美术院院长。
    《桂林胜景》、《寒梅宿雀》、《仙鹤之湖》和书法条幅共四组作品各有情趣，无不清新淡雅，与寺内环境相映和谐。
    除了善光寺，长野县人的话题都离不开“山”。山多林多，森林占全县面积的近80％。山多温泉也多，山中猴子冬天下温泉洗澡取暖是本县一大奇景。
    近年来，山岭产生更大经济效益的是冬季滑雪。县内有滑雪场100多个，每年冬季有300多万“滑客”前来，占全年游客的约50％。
    现在长野县人最关心的大事、最热门的话题是1998年冬季奥运会。经过国内竞选，长野县成为日本竞争召开1998年冬季奥运会的候选地。虽事情尚早，但当地人逢人便讲“请多关照”，冬季奥运会的徽章已经设计制作完毕，戴在胸前，印在明片上，好像冬季奥运会明天就要在这里开幕，表现出那般如醉如痴的向往和期待之情。有人问我，中国有多少滑雪场和滑雪者，可真把我考住了。他们说，近几年，长野县每年都向中国赠送滑雪用具，还邀请中国教练来此考察研修，今冬该县还将派团去中国访问比赛。滑雪在中日两国间正有越来越多的交流。
    在长野县吃饭，当地人首先向你推荐“信州面条”。“信州”是此地旧称。面条用荞麦面作成，佐以略带辣味的“信州酱汤”，别有风味。
    据说，长野县过去也是穷困地区，种植可粗放耕作的荞麦较多，荞麦面于是成为该县人的主要食粮。时至经济高度发达的今天，利用人们追求个性、喜尝地方风味的心理，廉价的面条成了体现地方特色的旅游食品。还听说，荞麦种70％是从中国进口的。
    时间在山林鸟语声中悄然流过。青山细雨之间，我们与长野县人握别，觉得幽美的湖光山色固然不易淡忘，而对长野县人引为自豪的三大旅游项目——善光寺、滑雪和信州面条、与中国结下的不解之缘，在记忆中则更加清晰深刻。
