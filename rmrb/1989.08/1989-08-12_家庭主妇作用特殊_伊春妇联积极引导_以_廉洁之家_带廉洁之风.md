The Women's Federation of Yichun City in Heilongjiang Province recently awarded "Clean Family" plaques to 27 households of party members and cadres selected by the public.

Based on the special role of women in the family and the fact that some party members and cadres often fall into corruption because their families are the first to be compromised, the city's Women's Federation actively advocates for the creation of "Clean Families" among women. This initiative educates the families of party members and cadres to start with themselves and their own families, practicing integrity and self-discipline to maintain a clean family culture.

Their main approaches include:
(1) Holding "Clean Family Management" television lectures to explain the relationship between clean family management and clean governance, and between rectifying family ethics and party ethics.
(2) Encouraging the public to "find the shining points around them," using group discussions to highlight the good deeds of neighbors and selecting a batch of "Clean Families."
(3) Organizing mass "Singing and Speaking about Integrity" performances.
(4) Organizing women to visit the homes of party and government leaders who are part of the "Clean Families," and having the housewives share their experiences and insights on clean family management.

The Yichun Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government support this activity. Under the leadership of the families of municipal and district-level leaders, 11 families of municipal leaders and 700 families of section-level cadres have joined the "Clean Family" initiative.

Since the launch of the "Clean Family" initiative four months ago, according to statistics from Yichun District, where cadres are concentrated, there have been 281 instances of cadres refusing bribes and 471 instances of cadres doing good deeds for the public. Now, there are fewer families engaging in extravagance and waste, fewer people participating in unhealthy entertainment activities like gambling, and more families practicing simple and frugal weddings and funerals.

    家庭主妇作用特殊　伊春妇联积极引导
    以“廉洁之家”带廉洁之风
    黑龙江省伊春市妇联前不久给该市27户群众推选的党员干部家庭挂上了“廉洁之家”的光荣匾。
    根据妇女在家庭中的特殊作用和某些党员干部变腐败往往由于家庭首先被打开缺口的事实，该市妇联积极倡导在妇女群众中开展创建“廉洁之家”的活动，教育党员干部家属从我做起，从自家做起，廉洁自律，保持廉洁的家风。
    她们的主要做法是：（一）通过举办“廉洁治家”专题电视讲座，讲清廉洁治家与廉洁治国的关系，正家风与正党风的关系；（二）发动群众“寻找自己身边的闪光点”，用大家谈、大家摆的办法，把周围邻里的廉洁好事摆出来，并推举出一批“廉洁之家”；（三）开展群众性的“说廉洁、唱廉洁”演唱活动；（四）组织妇女群众参观“廉洁之家”中的党员领导干部家庭，请家庭主妇介绍廉洁治家的经验体会。
    伊春市市委、市政府对这一活动给予支持。在市委、市政府领导干部家属的带动下，现该市已有11名市级领导干部的家属，700名处级干部家属参加到创建“廉洁之家”的活动之中去。
    开展创建“廉洁之家”活动4个多月来，据领导干部比较集中的伊春区统计，干部拒贿数达281次，干部为群众做好事471件。现在铺张浪费、请吃请喝的家庭减少了，参与打麻将赌博等不健康娱乐活动的人减少了，婚丧嫁娶简办的家庭增多了。
