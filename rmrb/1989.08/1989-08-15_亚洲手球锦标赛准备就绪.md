The fifth men's and the second women's Asian Handball Championships will commence on August 20 at the Yuetan Sports Gymnasium in Beijing. Currently, the preparations for these two Asian handball events, which China is hosting for the first time, are complete. Starting from August 16, 16 teams from 11 countries and regions that have registered for the competition will arrive in Beijing in succession.

According to an official from the organizing committee, based on the registration situation, the South Korean men's and women's teams have the strongest lineup. In the 1988 Seoul Olympics, they won the men's silver medal and the women's gold medal. This time, their men's team remains unchanged, while the women's team has undergone adjustments, but all eight key players remain the same. The teams that can compete with them are mainly from East Asia, such as the Japanese and Chinese Taipei women's teams and the Japanese men's team. The host country, China, will field a completely new lineup that was adjusted in mid-May this year. Due to the short training time and lack of competition experience, it will be difficult for them to achieve remarkable results this time. However, coaches have privately revealed that their goal this time is not just to train the team, but to showcase their newly developed techniques and tactics in front of the strong teams, finding a new starting point to advance to the world stage.

Chairman Fahad of the Asian Handball Federation and others will arrive in Beijing soon to preside over the Asian Handball Federation Council meeting to be held before the competition and to watch the games. It is reported that he will also inspect the preparations for the Beijing Asian Games in his capacity as the chairman of the Asian Olympic Council.

    亚洲手球锦标赛准备就绪
    本报北京8月15日讯　记者缪鲁、李北大报道：第五届男子和第二届女子亚洲手球锦标赛定于本月20日在北京月坛体育馆同时拉开战幕。目前，中国首次举办的这两个亚洲手球赛事均已筹备就绪，报名参赛的11个国家和地区的16队将从16日起陆续抵达赛地。
    据组委会官员日前介绍，从报名情况看，参赛诸队中以南朝鲜男女队实力最强，在去年汉城奥运会上，他们曾分获男子亚军和女子冠军。此次其男队仍为原班人马，女队员虽有调整，但8名主力无一变动。而有实力与之抗衡的均为东亚球队，如日本和中国台北女队、日本男队。曾获得亚运会男子冠军和奥运会女子第3名的东道主中国队将以今年5月中旬调整的全新阵容登场，由于集训时间不长，比赛经验甚少，此次难有惊人成绩。但教练们私下透露，他们此次参赛的目标不仅仅是锻炼队伍，而是要在强队面前拿出自己探索出的新技术和新战术，找到走向世界的新起点。
    亚洲手球联合会主席法赫德等也将于近日抵京，主持定于赛前召开的亚手联理事会，并观看比赛。据称，他还将以亚奥理事会主席的身份视察北京亚运会的筹备情况。
