The northern slope of the Greater Khingan Range in summer has long days, with dawn breaking at 3 AM and dusk falling at 11 PM. It is already 5 PM, but the weather is as hot as noon in the interior, with the blazing sun hanging high in the southern sky, scorching the earth like a furnace.

A jeep sped along the forest path. The director of the forestry bureau opened the window, letting the cool breeze blow freely. Gazing out of the car, the distant mountains undulated, all in a green world. Dense stands of deciduous pines, firs, and white birches stretched endlessly, rippling with the waves of a green sea. The summer of the Greater Khingan Range is beautiful. Just a glance at it fills one's eyes with fresh green and one's heart with hope, making one feel content.

Old Kong loves green, cherishes green. His 30-plus years in the forestry area have taken him through the Lesser Khingan Range and the Greater Khingan Range. Since taking over as the director of the 18th Station Forestry Bureau, he has achieved outstanding economic benefits, completing the timber production task excellently every year and earning hundreds of millions of yuan in profits. However, he is not satisfied with this. He pays more attention to social benefits, looks to the future, and focuses on afforestation, placing his work emphasis on forest management. He often says, "We cannot cut down all the trees left by our ancestors. Our responsibility is to leave a green forest for future generations..."

The car stopped. He got out alone and walked along the edge of the Huma River, entering the "73" nursery. "73" is the name of this place, named after being 73 kilometers away from the Black Dragon River. It is the newly built central nursery of the forestry bureau.

He did not want to disturb the nursery leaders and workers, wanting to inspect the site alone and see how the young seedlings were growing. He loves those seedlings, with a feeling like a mother loves her baby, and a farmer cares for his sprouting crops. He almost comes to see these "little darlings" every day. If he doesn't come for a few days, he feels "concerned," just like a mother misses her young children...

He came to a plot of the nursery and saw row upon row of tender green pine seedlings, each topped with a string of shiny water droplets, growing vigorously and full of vitality. His heart lit up: the seedlings are really thriving...

He bent down, almost kneeling on the ground. He used his hands to pull out a few weeds and grabbed a handful of black soil, looking at it again and again...

Was he deeply kissing the black soil of the Greater Khingan Range?

His usually stern, black face slowly bloomed into a smile like petals of a chrysanthemum. Beads of sweat rolled down from the wrinkles on his forehead, dropping onto the seedlings and the ground...

Here, today is a new sprout, tomorrow is a big tree; now is a small seedling, the future is a vast forest... A wave of hope, expectation, and confidence surged in his heart. He was deeply intoxicated by the green of the nursery. His eyes were full of new greenery. Green made him happy and excited, green made him intoxicated and at ease...

He didn't know when the nursery manager stood behind him, affectionately asking:
"Director, why didn't you give a heads-up?"

"Coming and going frequently, why bother with a heads-up?" Old Kong turned around and looked deeply at the manager, nodding satisfactorily and saying:
"Most of the seedlings have grown to 8 centimeters, reaching the national standard."

"The bureau requires this central nursery to become an advanced afforestation base. Now, 80% of the 80 million seedlings have reached the national standard." The manager's eyes flashed with confidence as he said.

Old Kong stood up, took a deep breath, and humorously said:
"If you can't grow good seedlings, I'll resign as the director!"

The manager burst into laughter.
"With the leadership so focused on afforestation, how can we not give our all?" His laughter echoed through the nursery forest...

At this moment, suddenly a "shower" fell from the clear sky, as the automatic irrigation machine began to spray water over the nursery.

The water lines splashing in all directions, under the sunlight, fluttered and sprinkled, misty and hazy, instantly flashing out a rainbow of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

Under the rainbow, the sunlight shone on the tall figures of Old Kong and the manager. Before their eyes was a living picture of afforestation, the green nursery more lush and full of vitality.

    绿的陶醉
    门瑞瑜
    大兴安岭北坡，夏天白昼长，早3时天亮，晚11时才黑天。此刻已是下午5时了，天气却像关内中午一样，火辣辣的太阳高悬正南，火炉一般烧烤着大地。
    吉普车沿着林间山路飞奔，坐在车上的林业局长打开车窗，让凉风尽情吹拂。遥望车外，远山连绵起伏，全是绿色的世界，茂密的落叶松、美人松、白桦林带浩瀚无尽，荡漾着绿海的波涛。大兴安岭的夏天是美丽的，只要瞥它一眼，就满眼新绿满怀希望，令人感到惬意。
    老孔喜欢绿色，热爱绿色。他的30多年林区生涯，足迹踏遍了小兴安岭和大兴安岭。他任十八站林业局长以来，经济效益突出，年年出色完成木材生产任务，盈利几百万元。然而他并不以此为满足，他更注意社会效益，放眼未来，狠抓造林，把自己的工作重点放在营林上。他经常说：“不能把老祖宗留下的木头砍光，我们的责任是交给后人一片绿色的森林……”
    车子停下了。他一个人下车，沿呼玛河边而去，走进了“73”苗圃。“73”是这里的地名，因为离黑龙江边的三合73公里而得名，它是林业局新建的中心苗圃。
    他不愿意惊动苗圃领导和工人，想一个人去实地考查，去看看那些小树苗生长的情况。他喜欢那些树苗，那心情就像一个母亲喜欢自己的婴儿，农夫关注出垅的禾苗一样，几乎天天来看望这些“小宝宝”，如果几天不来，他心里很“惦念”，就像母亲惦念自己亲生的幼年儿女……
    他来到一畦苗圃，只见一株株嫩绿的落叶松苗，顶着一串串刚浇过的晶莹水珠儿，长势茁壮，充满蓬勃的生机，他心头一亮：小苗真旺！……
    他俯下身子，几乎是跪在地面上，他用双手薅去了几棵小草，抓了一把黑黝黝的泥土，瞅了又瞅……
    他是在深情地吻那大兴安岭黑土地吗？
    他那经常严肃地板着的黑色面孔，轻轻地绽开了菊花瓣儿似的微笑，额头上滚滚的汗珠从垅沟般皱纹里流出，吧嗒、吧嗒地跌落在苗上、地上……
    这里，今天是一芽新苗，明天是一棵大树；现在的一株小苗，未来的一片大森林……一种希冀、期望、信心交织着的波澜，在他心头激荡，他入迷着魔地沉浸在苗圃的绿色中。他的眼前处处新绿，绿，绿使他喜悦、激奋，绿使他陶醉、神怡……
    不知道什么时候，苗圃主任站在他身后，亲昵地问：
    “老局长来，咋不打招呼？”
    “常来常往打什么招呼？”老孔转身回过头来，深情地望着站长，满意地点了点头说：
    “多数树苗已长到8厘米，达到国家标准了。”
    “局里要求这中心苗圃建成先进的造林基地。现在800万株树苗80％已达到国家标准。”老站长目光一闪，充满信心地说。
    老孔站起来，舒了一口气，幽默地说：
    “你们育不出好苗，我这个局长就辞职！”
    站长霍霍地笑出了声来。
    “领导这么重视造林，我们下边人能不豁出命干吗？”他的笑声荡漾在苗圃林地……
    这时，忽然晴空中“骤雨”从天而降，那是自动灌溉机开始向苗圃飞洒喷水。
    直射四溅的水线，迎着阳光飘飘洒洒，雾霭蒙蒙，刹时闪烁出一道赤、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫的“彩虹”。
    那彩虹下阳光照射老孔和站长那修长的身影，他们的眼前正是一幅活的育林图画，绿绿的苗圃，更加郁郁葱葱、生机无限。
