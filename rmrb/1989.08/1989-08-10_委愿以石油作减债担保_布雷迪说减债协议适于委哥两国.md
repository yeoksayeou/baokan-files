Venezuela, which is currently in negotiations with international creditor banks to reduce its debt, has proposed using oil as collateral for the repayment of the reduced debt if the banks agree to cut 210 billion dollars of debt by 50%. The Venezuelan government began discussions with international creditor banks late last month to address the issue of reducing 210 billion dollars in commercial bank debt. At that time, Mexico had already reached an agreement with international creditor banks to reduce its debt by 35%.

In addition to the oil collateral, Venezuela's proposal includes guaranteeing the payment of interest on the reduced debt for a period of four years. However, Venezuela's use of oil exports as collateral is conditional on the international creditor banks agreeing to the percentage of debt reduction proposed by Venezuela.

Meanwhile, reports from local newspapers indicate that U.S. Treasury Secretary Brady, who is currently visiting Mexico, stated yesterday that the results of Mexico's debt reduction negotiations could serve as a model for Venezuela and Costa Rica. However, it is not yet applicable to Argentina and Brazil.

    委愿以石油作减债担保
    布雷迪说减债协议适于委哥两国
    本报加拉加斯8月8日电  记者朱满庭报道：正在与国际债权银行谈判削减债务的委内瑞拉政府提出，如果银行方面同意将210亿美元的债务削减50％，那么委内瑞拉政府将用石油作为支付削减后债务的担保。
    委内瑞拉是从上月下旬开始与国际债权银行进行接触，讨论削减210亿美元的商业银行债务问题的。当时墨西哥已与国际债权银行达成削减债务35％的协议。
    在委内瑞拉提出的担保条件中还包括担保支付为期4年的债务利息。但委内瑞拉用石油出口作担保，需以国际债权银行同意委内瑞拉提出的减债百分比为先决条件。
    另据此间报纸报道，正在墨西哥访问的美国财长布雷迪昨天表示，墨西哥减债谈判取得的成果可以成为运用于委内瑞拉和哥斯达黎加的一个样板。但尚不能适用于阿根廷和巴西。
