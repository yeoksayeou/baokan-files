The Beijing Fangzhuang commercial residential area, which began construction on September 15, 1986, is progressing smoothly. Currently, the construction area is 1.51 million square meters, and by the end of this year, 700,000 square meters will be completed and ready for use.

Fangzhuang is currently the largest commercial residential area under construction in Beijing, with a total construction area of 2.7 million square meters. This is equivalent to the combined area of five Qianmen, four Jingsong, and five Tuanjiehu residential areas. Upon completion, it will provide homes for over 20,000 households, offering some of the best new residences in the country. The residential area is located between the Second Ring Road and the Third Ring Road in the southeastern part of the city, with five overpasses surrounding it.
