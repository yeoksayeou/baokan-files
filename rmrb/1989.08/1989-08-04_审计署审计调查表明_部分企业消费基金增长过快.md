	The Audit Office's investigation shows that the consumption funds of some enterprises have grown much faster than the increase in labor productivity.

	According to the audit investigation, 29 enterprises under the jurisdiction of Nanjing City had a total wage bill of 150 million yuan in 1988, an increase of 17.9% over the previous year's 130 million yuan. However, the output value and realized profits and taxes of these enterprises increased by only an average of 8%, and the total profit decreased by 10.5%. The actual amount of wages paid to workers by these enterprises was 140 million yuan, an increase of 40.6% over the previous year, while labor productivity increased by only 6.6%.

	According to another investigation, four large and medium-sized enterprises in Wuhan City and Xiangfan City had a 13.7% increase in labor productivity in 1988 compared to 1987, while the total wage bill for workers increased from 25.64 million yuan to 33.1 million yuan, an increase of 29%. In Wuhan City, 13 commercial enterprises saw a 1.6% decrease in profits from 1987 to 1985, while individual bonus income for workers increased by 57.1%.
