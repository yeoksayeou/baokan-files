The presidents of the five Central American countries held two days of intense discussions but failed to overcome differences in formulating a joint plan to disarm Nicaraguan anti-government forces. It is believed that the summit has reached a stalemate today.

It is understood that the main disagreement at the summit lies in Honduras' proposed disarmament plan, which stipulates that Nicaraguan anti-government forces must withdraw from Honduran territory. However, the plan does not specify the exact date for implementation. Nicaragua insists that the joint plan must set a deadline for disarmament; a disarmament plan without a deadline is meaningless. Regarding Honduras' demand that Nicaragua withdraw its lawsuit against Honduras at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega stated that as long as the Nicaraguan anti-government forces stationed in Honduras have not been disarmed, Nicaragua will not withdraw the lawsuit. On the issue of who should act first, both sides have their own arguments, leading to the current stalemate. Whether this disagreement can be overcome will be the key to the success of this summit.

    未能就遣散尼反政府武装达成一致
    中美洲首脑会议出现僵局
    本报特拉8月6日电　记者郭伟成报道：中美洲五国总统经过2天的紧张讨论，未能克服在制订遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装的共同计划方面的分歧，据认为，首脑会议今天出现了僵局。
    据悉，目前首脑会议的主要分歧在于，洪都拉斯提出的遣散计划规定尼加拉瓜反政府武装必须撤出洪都拉斯境内。但是没有规定具体实施遣散的日期。尼加拉瓜坚持认为，共同计划必须规定遣散的期限；没有期限的遣散计划是没有意义的。对于洪都拉斯要求尼加拉瓜撤回在海牙国际法庭对洪都拉斯的起诉；尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加说，只要盘踞在洪都拉斯境内的尼加拉瓜反政府武装还没有遣散，尼加拉瓜就不撤回起诉。在孰先孰后问题上，双方各执一词，形成僵局。能否克服这一分歧，将成为这次首脑会议能否成功的关键。
