Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made profound and clear statements on a series of issues regarding the position, role, direction, tasks, content, and methods of ideological and political work in the new era. Reviewing these statements is of great practical significance for us to summarize past experiences and implement the tasks of strengthening ideological and political work proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

Ideological and political work in the new era must be strengthened, not weakened

After the focus of the Party and the state shifted to socialist modernization with economic construction as the center, is ideological and political work still important? How should we correctly understand the position and role of ideological and political work? Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly given clear answers and profound explanations to this question. On August 18, 1980, he explicitly pointed out: "We must place ideological and political work in a very important position and do it seriously and conscientiously, without slackening off." On October 12, 1983, he reminded the entire Party: "After the focus of work shifted to economic construction, the entire Party must study how to adapt to new conditions and strengthen the Party's ideological work, and prevent the tendency to focus solely on economic work and neglect ideological work."

Why is it necessary to strengthen ideological and political work? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's explanations mainly include the following points:

(1) Revolutionary spirit is a powerful spiritual force for achieving victory in revolution and construction. Without revolutionary spirit, relying solely on material conditions, our revolution and construction would not be possible.

(2) Ideological and political work is an important guarantee for modernization. Our modernization is socialist modernization. We must build not only socialist material civilization but also socialist spiritual civilization. Ideological and political work can not only ensure the correct direction of socialist modernization but also mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people.

(3) Strengthening ideological and political work is an important part of improving and strengthening the Party's leadership. Improving the Party's leadership, the most important aspect is to strengthen ideological and political work. In the absence of clear separation between Party and government, various levels of Party organizations have less time and energy to do ideological and political work, which affects not only the Party's own construction but also the play of the Party's leadership role. After separating Party from government, the Party's leadership organs, in addition to formulating policies and deciding on the use of important cadres, should devote most of their time and energy to doing ideological and political work, work on people, and work on the masses. Otherwise, the Party's leadership will neither be improved nor strengthened.

(4) China is currently in the primary stage of socialism, and remnants of feudalism, bourgeois ideology, petty-bourgeois ideology, and other non-proletarian ideologies still exist. With the opening to the outside world, bourgeois ideology and lifestyles from abroad will also take advantage of the situation. A strong ideological and political work is a sharp weapon to resist and overcome the infiltration of various non-proletarian ideologies.

The fundamental task of ideological and political work is to ensure the smooth progress of socialist modernization construction and cultivate "four-haves" new people

Under the new historical conditions, the central task of the Party is to lead the people of the whole country in building a socialist modernized power. Ideological and political work must serve this task and must take ensuring the smooth progress of socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up, and educating the people of the whole country to have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, as its fundamental task. This is an important idea that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly pointed out that ideological and political work should serve socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up, and ensure the completion of various tasks. He pointed out that achieving the four modernizations is the greatest politics. Marxist ideological and theoretical work cannot be separated from real politics. Deeply studying the new situations and problems encountered by China in achieving the four modernizations and providing answers with great guiding significance will be a major contribution of our ideological and theoretical workers to Marxism. Ideological and political work should closely combine with the actual work of various tasks, promote the completion of various tasks and the development of productive forces. In the future, we should take whether it helps to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, whether it helps the country to prosper and develop, and whether it helps the people to become rich and happy, as the standard to measure whether our various tasks are right or wrong. Without this main content, politics will become empty politics, divorced from the greatest interests of the Party and the people.

According to the objective requirements of socialist modernization construction, Comrade Deng Xiaoping proposed the strategic task of cultivating "four-haves" new people. He pointed out that to achieve the four modernizations of socialism, not only should the people of the whole country have ideals, morality, and discipline, but they should also master modern science and culture and professional technical knowledge. Because without ideals and discipline, the Chinese people cannot unite and organize, and will be like the old China, a loose sand, and modernization construction will not be successful. Therefore, the four aspects of "four-haves," ideals and discipline are the most important. However, if there is only the desire to build socialism without real talent and learning, socialism modernization cannot be achieved. Therefore, it is also necessary to have culture. It can be said that the "four-haves" proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only highly summarizes the entire content of spiritual civilization construction but also points out the correct direction for the all-round development of people under socialist conditions.

An important issue in cultivating "four-haves" new people is how to correctly handle the relationship between red and expert. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that in the new historical conditions, red is absolutely not to be abandoned. The selection of cadres should first be revolutionary, with adherence to the socialist path as the premise. Schools should always put the correct political direction in the first place. However, being red alone is not enough, one must also be expert, achieving both red and expert. The construction of the cadre team should emphasize both revolutionization and youth, knowledge, and specialization. Students should put the correct political direction in the first place, which not only does not exclude the study of science and culture but, on the contrary, the higher the political awareness, the more consciously and diligently one should study science and culture for the revolution. Comrades in various industries, under the condition of adhering to the socialist political stance, should strive to do a good job in their positions, which is not only not detached from politics but is precisely a manifestation of socialist awareness. Various levels of Party and government leaders should also take the lead in doing a good job in their positions, which is not only not detached from politics but is precisely a manifestation of socialist awareness.

Deeply carry out ideological and political education with the main content of adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization

What are the main focuses of ideological and political work in the new era? Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized two aspects of content: on the one hand, deepening education on adhering to the four cardinal principles, adhering to reform and opening up, patriotism, socialism, independence, self-reliance, hard work, communist ideals, laws, the Party's line, principles, and policies, and the situation and tasks; on the other hand, opposing bourgeois liberalization and resisting and opposing bourgeois decadent ideology, feudal remnants, and other non-proletarian ideologies.

Conducting education on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization is an important idea that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has consistently adhered to and repeatedly emphasized. He pointed out that the four cardinal principles are the fundamental premise for achieving the four modernizations. If any of the four cardinal principles are shaken, the socialist cause and the entire modernization cause will be shaken. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state. Ideological and theoretical workers should, based on new and rich facts, provide new and convincing arguments to educate the people of the whole country and convince those seeking truth in today's China.

Bourgeois liberalization is capitalism, and its core is to oppose the Party's leadership and the socialist system. We must clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization and regard it as a long-term task. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that opposing bourgeois liberalization is a long-term educational issue, parallel to the construction of the four modernizations. The entire process of the four modernizations will involve the issue of opposing bourgeois liberalization. The four modernizations will take 50 to 70 years, and during these 50 to 70 years, the issue of opposing bourgeois liberalization will always exist.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that we must, under the leadership and planning of the whole Party and the whole country, carry out education on patriotism and socialism, enhance national self-esteem, and strengthen the confidence to follow the socialist path. Only socialism can save China. This is an unshakable historical conclusion drawn by the Chinese people from the May Fourth Movement to the present more than sixty years of deep experience. Our Party and people have struggled for many years in blood and sweat to establish the socialist system. Although this system is not yet perfect and has been damaged, no matter what, the socialist system is much better than the capitalist system of the law of the jungle and harming others for personal gain. Our system will be perfected day by day, and it will absorb the progressive elements we can learn from all countries in the world to become the best system in the world. He believed that loving the motherland and loving socialism are consistent. He severely criticized the erroneous idea that "not loving socialism does not mean not loving the motherland." He pointed out: "Is the motherland abstract? Not loving the new China led by the Communist Party, loving what? The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas cannot be required to all support socialism, but at least they cannot oppose the new China of socialism, otherwise how can it be called patriotism? As for every citizen and every young person under the leadership of the People's Republic of China, our requirements for them, of course, should be higher."

Independence and self-reliance, hard work and self-improvement are the fine traditions of our Party. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in light of the new situations and problems that have emerged under new historical conditions, reaffirmed this fine tradition and made profound explanations:

(1) Independence and self-reliance, whether in the past, present, or future, are our starting point. But independence and self-reliance are not blindly anti-foreign, and self-reliance is not closing the door to the outside world. While insisting on self-reliance, we also need to open up to the outside world and absorb foreign capital and technology to help us develop.

(2) The spirit of hard work and self-improvement is a prerequisite for achieving the four modernizations. China's four modernizations must be achieved through hard work and self-improvement. We are poor, with a weak foundation, and education, science, and culture are all backward, which determines that we still need a process of hard work and self-improvement. Education on hard work and self-improvement should be strengthened in the future and continued for 60 to 70 years. The more the country develops, the more we need to grasp hard work and self-improvement.

(3) In the new historical conditions, carrying forward the spirit of hard work and self-improvement means that in the process of modernization construction, we must not be afraid of difficulties, dare to think, dare to explore, and dare to innovate. We must correctly handle the relationship between developing production and improving living standards, gradually improve living standards on the basis of developing production, oppose the absurd and reactionary views advocated by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" such as poor socialism, poor transition, and poor revolution, and also oppose the view of realizing a so-called welfare state in China now. Party members and cadres, especially high-level cadres, should take the lead in hard work and self-improvement, oppose special privileges. At the same time, we must eliminate all kinds of waste, improve labor productivity, reduce products that do not meet social needs and substandard products, lower various costs, and improve the utilization rate of funds.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping also proposed the task of continuing to eliminate the feudal remnants in ideological and political aspects. He pointed out that the work of eliminating the influence of feudal remnants should be combined with the criticism of bourgeois ideas of harming others for personal gain, selfishness, and other corrupt ideas. Whether feudal remnants are more serious or bourgeois influence is more serious, in different regions and departments, in different issues, in people of different ages, experiences, and education, the situation can be very different, and we must not generalize.

Strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly proposed to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. On December 13, 1978, he proposed that all Party members should be good at learning and good at relearning. Learn what? The fundamental thing is to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. On March 27, 1981, he again emphasized the need to seriously study the works of Marx and Mao Zedong. He said that now, some people often only look at the surface, because they lack a foundation in both theory and practice. Only by laying a foundation can we truly correct mistakes. On September 23, 1985, he once again proposed that both old and new cadres should study Marxist theory and hoped that the Party Central Committee could make feasible decisions to enable all levels of Party cadres, especially leading cadres, to have some time to study and familiarize themselves with the basic theory of Marxism in their busy work, thereby strengthening the principles, systematization, foresight, and creativity in our work.

"Now we are in the process of construction, and the most urgent need is to learn professional and management knowledge. What is the practical significance of learning Marxist theory?" Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that this is a misunderstanding. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are our guide to action and an important guarantee for achieving victory in revolution and construction. We are now building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the era and tasks have changed. There are indeed many new things to learn, which makes us more eager to learn and master the basic theory of Marxism in light of new realities. Only in this way can we improve our ability to use its basic methods to actively explore solutions to new basic political, economic, social, and cultural problems, both pushing our cause and Marxist theory forward and preventing some comrades, especially some newly promoted middle-aged and young comrades, from losing their way in increasingly complex struggles. Only in this way can our Party adhere to the socialist path, build and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and ultimately achieve our ultimate goal of realizing communism.

How to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out:

(1) We should study Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin's scientific works and Mao Zedong's scientific works in an integrated and accurate manner, be good at learning, mastering, and applying the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, neither negate the guiding role of Marxist theory in modernization construction under the pretext of changing circumstances, nor advocate the "two whatevers."

(2) We should adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice, combining the study of Marxist theory with the actuality of socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up. Marxist theory has never been a dogma but a guide to action. It requires people to, based on its basic principles and basic methods, constantly combine with the changing reality, explore new answers to solve problems, and thus develop Marxist theory itself.

(3) We should distinguish between Mao Zedong Thought and the errors of Mao Zedong in his later years. We insist on and take as our guide to action the basic principles of Mao Zedong Thought, or the scientific system constituted by these basic principles. The errors of Mao Zedong in his later years do not belong to the scientific system constituted by the basic principles of Mao Zedong Thought.

Inherit the fine traditions of ideological and political work, summarize new experiences, and create new methods

Comrade Deng Xiaoping warned us that strengthening ideological and political work is not about repeating the old "leftist" path, but about adapting to the new situation and tasks, constantly reforming and innovating. He pointed out that the fundamental tasks and content of ideological and political work have not changed, and our fine traditions are still the same. However, the times are different, the conditions are different, and the objects are different, so the methods to solve problems are also different. Therefore, ideological and political work in the new era must combine inheriting fine traditions with reform and innovation, constantly study new situations, solve new problems, summarize new experiences, and create new methods. In this regard, the following thoughts of Comrade Deng Xiaoping are worth noting.

(1) The method of thorough reasoning and calm discussion. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that using the method of mass movements to solve mass ideological education problems has never been successful. The method of thorough reasoning and calm discussion is the method of persuasion and education, the method of democracy. To correctly use this method, first, educators must master the basic theory of Marxism, learn to use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to answer the questions raised by cadres and the masses, and convince them with reason. Second, democracy should be advocated, and all channels for expression should be opened, insisting on not pulling hair, not labeling, and not beating sticks. Third, we must thoroughly negate the past simple, one-sided, and violent so-called criticism, as well as the handling methods of cruel struggle and merciless blows.

(2) The method of distinguishing levels and teaching according to individual needs. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that while encouraging and helping everyone to work hard, we still cannot ignore the differences in political awareness, ability, and morality shown by individuals in their growth process, and give different treatments according to these differences, so that everyone can advance towards the general goal of socialism and communism according to different conditions. We should do ideological and political work according to the different situations of each unit and each individual.

(3) The method of combining with reality and explaining according to facts. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that education must be combined with reality. For some important ideological issues prevalent among a part of cadres and the masses that affect social customs, we must conduct thorough investigations and research, and have appropriate people conduct thorough, detailed, and convincing education. Simple, one-sided, and arbitrary statements are not acceptable. Leaders at all levels must frequently explain the actual living problems and current policies that the masses are concerned about, tell everyone the objective situation and the efforts made by the Party and the government, and promptly correct the unreasonable phenomena reflected by the masses. When the masses feel from the facts that the Party and socialism are good, then education on ideals and discipline, communist ideology, and patriotism will be effective.

(4) The method of criticism and self-criticism. This method is originally one of our Party's fine traditions, but due to the influence of "leftism" and the interference of bourgeois liberalization, some comrades dare not criticize erroneous tendencies, and when someone criticizes, they say it is beating sticks. Now it is very difficult to carry out criticism, and self-criticism is even more difficult. In view of this situation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly pointed out that the weapon of criticism must not be abandoned, and criticism must not be regarded as beating sticks. We must allow criticism and allow counter-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism must stand on the Marxist standpoint and not on the "leftist" standpoint. Communist Party members and Party cadres must take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Within the Party, no matter who it is, no matter how high or low their position, they must be able to accept criticism and carry out self-criticism.

(5) The method of combining ideological education with solving practical problems. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that revolutionary spirit is very precious, and without revolutionary spirit, there would be no revolutionary action. However, revolution is produced on the basis of material interests. If we only talk about the spirit of sacrifice and do not talk about material interests, that is idealism. Therefore, on the one hand, we must pay attention to strengthening ideological education and improving the ideological awareness of the masses; on the other hand, we must care about the lives of the masses and pay attention to solving practical problems. For problems that are difficult to solve for the time being, we must explain them clearly to the masses.

(6) The method of combining ideological education with strict discipline. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that without rule of law, it is not good, and the key to strengthening the rule of law is education, and the fundamental issue is to educate people. For those who make mistakes, on the basis of ideological education and assistance, those with serious circumstances must be dealt with seriously. Those who should be expelled from the Party should be expelled from the Party, and those who should be demoted or given other punishments should be given these punishments. Those who commit crimes should also be dealt with according to law. For student disturbances, it is necessary to mainly adopt the method of guidance. However, if it affects social order and violates criminal law, it must be dealt with decisively. Guidance includes legal handling.

(7) Mobilize all forces in society to do ideological and political work. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always believed that ideological and political work is a mass work. Party committees at all levels, leading cadres at all levels, every Party member, governments at all levels, trade unions, women's federations, Communist Youth League, and all organizations engaged in educational work, and all comrades engaged in cultural work should do it. The ideological and political work of the army should be done by all military, political, and logistics personnel of the army. The cultural and ideological front should produce more good products and resolutely stop the production, import, and spread of bad products. Newspapers, radio, and television should take improving the socialist awareness of the people, especially the youth, as one of their regular and basic tasks. Socialist literature and art should, through vivid and moving artistic images, truly reflect the rich social life, reflect the essence of various social relationships, express the requirements of the times and the trend of historical development, and strive to use socialist ideology to educate the people. The warriors on the ideological front should all be engineers of the human soul, should hold high the banner of Marxism and socialism, and use their articles, works, teaching, speeches, and performances to educate and guide the people to correctly treat history, understand reality, firmly believe in socialism and the Party's leadership, and inspire the people to strive for the cause of socialist modernization construction.

Be consistent in words and deeds, set an example, and combine verbal and personal education, with personal education being more important than verbal education

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Ideological and political work "must be done in a targeted, detailed, and in-depth manner and be acceptable to the masses. The most important condition is that whatever needs to be done to mobilize the masses, every Party member, especially those holding leadership positions, must first start with themselves." Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized this point mainly because ideological and political work is the work of educating people, and the masses always listen to what the educators say and observe what they do. If the educators' words and deeds are not consistent, ideological and political work will inevitably lack persuasiveness. Being consistent in words and deeds, setting an example, combining verbal and personal education, and personal education being more important than verbal education, is a fine tradition and important principle of ideological and political work. The power of example is infinite. If every Communist Party member can set an example, all our work will be easy to do.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping particularly emphasized that high-level cadres should set an example. He pointed out that whether high-level cadres can set an example has a great impact. The masses are all watching them, and if they do well, it will be easier for those below them. Some of our high-level cadres not only practice special privileges themselves but also influence their relatives and children, leading them astray. The masses oppose special privileges, and the cadres below oppose special privileges, first of all, they are aimed at us high-level cadres. Therefore, to rectify Party style and improve social customs, we must start with us high-level cadres.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that political cadres must also set an example. We did this in the war years. At that time, if you were not brave in battle and afraid of death, you would not be in harmony with the soldiers, and you would not be able to do political work. Political cadres cannot say one thing and do another. In the new historical conditions, we must restore and carry forward the fine traditions of political work, which also depends on political cadres setting an example.

Communist Party members and Party leaders at all levels must set an example, not only solving ideological problems but also solving institutional problems, and institutional problems are more fundamental, comprehensive, stable, and long-term. Therefore, while strengthening ideological education, we must also strengthen institutional construction. For the scope of powers and political and living treatment of cadres at all levels, various regulations should be formulated, and there should be specialized institutions to carry out impartial and strict supervision and inspection.

    加强思想政治工作的正确指针
    ——重读邓小平同志关于新时期思想政治工作的论述
    苏希胜
    党的十一届三中全会以来，邓小平同志对新时期思想政治工作的地位、作用、方向、任务、内容、方法等一系列问题进行了深刻明确的论述。重温这些论述，对于我们总结过去的经验，落实党的十三届四中全会提出的加强思想政治工作的任务，具有十分重要的现实意义。
      新时期思想政治工作只能加强不能削弱
    在党和国家的工作重点转移到以经济建设为中心的社会主义现代化建设上来以后，思想政治工作还重要不重要？怎样正确认识思想政治工作的地位和作用？邓小平同志对这个问题多次进行了明确的回答和深刻的阐述。1980年8月18日，他明确指出：“我们一定要把思想政治工作放在非常重要的地位，切实认真做好，不能放松。”（《邓小平文选》第301页，以下引文除注明者外，均引自《邓小平文选》） 1983年10月12日，他提醒全党：“在工作重心转到经济建设以后，全党要研究如何适应新的条件，加强党的思想工作，防止埋头经济工作、忽视思想工作的倾向。”（《建设有中国特色的社会主义》增订本，第36—37页）
    为什么要加强思想政治工作呢？邓小平同志的论述主要有以下几个方面：（一）革命精神是夺取革命和建设胜利的强大精神力量。没有革命精神，光靠物质条件，我们的革命和建设都不可能胜利。（二）思想政治工作是现代化建设的重要保证。我们的现代化是社会主义的现代化，不但要建设社会主义的物质文明，而且要建设社会主义的精神文明。思想政治工作不仅能保证社会主义现代化建设的正确方向，而且能调动广大人民群众的积极性和创造性。（三）加强思想政治工作是加强和改善党的领导的重要内容。改善党的领导，其中最主要的，就是加强思想政治工作。在党政不分的情况下，各级党组织没有更多的时间和精力做思想政治工作，不仅影响了党的自身建设，也影响了党的领导作用的发挥。党政分开后，党的领导机关除了掌握方针政策和决定重要干部的使用以外，要腾出主要的时间和精力来做思想政治工作，做人的工作，做群众工作。否则党的领导既不可能改善，也不可能加强。（四）我国正处于社会主义初级阶段，封建主义残余、资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想和其它各种非无产阶级思想仍然存在，随着对外开放，国外资产阶级思想和生活方式也会乘机而入。坚强有力的思想政治工作是抵制和克服各种非无产阶级思想侵蚀的锐利武器。
      思想政治工作的根本任务是保证社会主义
    现代化建设的顺利进行，培育“四有”新人
    在新的历史条件下，党的中心任务是领导全国人民建设社会主义的现代化强国，思想政治工作必须服务于这一任务，必须把保证社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的顺利进行，教育全国人民做到有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律，作为自己的根本任务。这是邓小平同志反复强调的一个重要思想。
    邓小平同志多次指出，思想政治工作要为社会主义现代化建设和改革开放服务，保证各项任务的完成。他指出，实现四个现代化是最大的政治。马克思主义的思想理论工作是不能离开现实政治的。深入研究中国实现四个现代化所遇到的新情况、新问题，并作出有重大指导意义的答案，这将是我们思想理论工作者对马克思主义的重大贡献。思想政治工作要密切结合各项工作的实际，促进各项任务的完成和生产力的发展。今后，要以是否有助于建设有中国特色的社会主义，是否有助于国家的兴旺发达，是否有助于人民的富裕幸福，作为衡量我们各项工作做得对或不对的标准。离开这个主要的内容，政治就变成空头政治，就离开了党和人民的最大利益。
    根据社会主义现代化建设的客观要求，邓小平同志提出了培育“四有”新人这一战略任务。他指出，实现社会主义的四个现代化，不仅需要全国人民做到有理想、有道德、有纪律，而且要掌握现代科学文化和专业技术知识。因为没有理想和纪律，我国人民就不能团结起来，组织起来，就会像旧中国那样一盘散沙，现代化建设就不可能成功。因此，“四有”的四个方面，理想和纪律最重要。但是，如果只有建设社会主义的愿望，没有真才实学，还是不能实现社会主义的现代化。因此，还必须做到有文化。可以说，邓小平同志提出的“四有”，不仅高度概括了精神文明建设的全部内容，而且为社会主义条件下人的全面发展指明了正确的方向。
    培育“四有”新人的一个重要问题是如何正确处理红与专的关系。邓小平同志指出，在新的历史条件下，红是绝对不能丢的。选拔干部首先是革命化，要以坚持社会主义道路为前提。学校要永远把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位。但是，只红不行，还必须专，做到又红又专。干部队伍建设既要讲革命化，又要讲年轻化、知识化和专业化。学生把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，这不仅不排斥学习科学文化，相反，政治觉悟越是高，为革命学习科学文化就应该越加自觉，越加刻苦。各行各业的同志在坚持社会主义的政治立场的条件下，努力做好自己的岗位工作，这不但不是脱离政治，而且正是有社会主义觉悟的表现。
        深入进行以坚持四项基本原则、反对资产
    阶级自由化为主要内容的思想政治教育
    新时期的思想政治工作主要抓些什么？邓小平同志着重强调了两个方面的内容：一方面，要深入进行坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放、爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗、共产主义理想和道德、法制、党的路线方针政策和形势任务等方面的教育；另一方面，要反对资产阶级自由化，抵制和反对资产阶级腐朽思想、封建主义残余和其它各种非无产阶级思想。
    进行坚持四项基本原则的教育、反对资产阶级自由化，是邓小平同志一贯坚持、反复强调的一个重要思想。他指出，四项基本原则是实现四个现代化的根本前提。如果动摇了这四项基本原则的任何一项，那就动摇了社会主义事业，整个现代化事业。四项基本原则是立国之本。思想理论工作者要根据新的丰富的事实作出新的有充分说服力的论证，以教育全国人民，说服那些向今天的中国寻求真理的人们。
    资产阶级自由化就是资本主义化，其核心是反对党的领导，反对社会主义制度。必须旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，并把它作为一项长期的任务。邓小平同志指出，反对资产阶级自由化是一个长期教育的问题，同四个现代化建设将是平行的，整个四个现代化的过程都存在一个反对资产阶级自由化的问题。四个现代化，我们要搞五十年至七十年，在这五十年至七十年内都存在一个反对资产阶级自由化的问题。
    邓小平同志指出，一定要在全党和全国范围内有领导、有计划地进行爱国主义和社会主义的教育，提高民族自尊心，坚定走社会主义道路的信心。只有社会主义才能救中国，这是中国人民从五四运动到现在六十多年来的深切体验中得出的不可动摇的历史结论。我们的党和人民浴血奋斗多年，建立了社会主义制度。尽管这个制度还不完善，又遭受了破坏，但是无论如何，社会主义制度总比弱肉强食、损人利己的资本主义制度好得多。我们的制度将一天天完善起来，它将吸收我们可以从世界各国吸收的进步因素成为世界上最好的制度。他认为，热爱祖国和热爱社会主义是一致的。他严厉批评了“不爱社会主义不等于不爱国”的错误思想。他指出：“难道祖国是抽象的吗？不爱共产党领导的社会主义的新中国，爱什么呢？港澳、台湾、海外的爱国同胞，不能要求他们都拥护社会主义，但是至少也不能反对社会主义的新中国，否则怎么能叫爱国呢？至于对中华人民共和国领导下的每一个公民，每一个青年，我们的要求当然要更高一些。”（第347页）
    独立自主、艰苦奋斗是我们党的优良传统。邓小平同志结合新的历史条件下出现的新情况、新问题，重申了这个优良传统，并进行了深刻的阐述：（一）独立自主，自力更生，无论过去、现在和将来都是我们的立足点。但独立自主不是盲目排外，自力更生更不是闭关自守。在坚持自力更生的同时还需要对外开放，吸收外国的资金和技术来帮助我们发展。（二）艰苦奋斗的创业精神是实现四个现代化必须具备的前提之一。中国搞四个现代化，要老老实实地艰苦创业。我们穷，底子薄，教育、科学、文化都落后，这就决定了我们还要有一个艰苦奋斗的过程。艰苦朴素的教育今后要抓紧，一直要抓六十至七十年。国家越发展，越要抓艰苦创业。（三）在新的历史条件下发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，就要在现代化建设的过程中，不怕困难，勇于思考，勇于探索，勇于创新。就要正确处理发展生产和改善生活的关系，要在发展生产的基础上逐步改善生活，既要反对林彪、“四人帮”提倡的穷社会主义、穷过渡、穷革命等荒谬反动的观点，也要反对现在要在中国实现所谓福利国家的观点。党员、干部，特别是高级干部要带头艰苦奋斗，要反对特殊化。同时要杜绝各种浪费，提高劳动生产率，减少不合社会需要的产品和不合质量要求的废品，降低各种成本，提高资金利用率。
    邓小平同志还提出了继续肃清思想政治方面的封建主义残余的任务。他指出，要把肃清封建主义残余影响的工作，同对于资产阶级损人利己、唯利是图思想和其他腐化思想的批判结合起来。是封建主义残余比较严重，还是资产阶级影响比较严重，在不同的地区和部门，在不同问题上，在不同年龄、经历和教养的人身上，情况可以很不同，千万不可一概而论。
    加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习
    邓小平同志多次提出要加强马列主义、毛泽东思想的学习。1978年12月13日，他提出，全党同志要善于学习，善于重新学习。学习什么？根本的是要学习马列主义、毛泽东思想。1981年3月27日，他又强调，要认真学习马克思、毛泽东同志的著作。他说，现在，有些人发议论，往往只看现象，原因是理论和实践都没有根底。只有打下根底，才能真正纠正错误。1985年9月23日，他再一次提出，新老干部都要学习马克思主义的理论，并希望党中央能作出切实可行的决定，使全党的各级干部，首先是领导干部，在繁忙的工作中，仍有一定的时间学习，熟悉马克思主义的基本理论，从而加强我们工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性。
      “现在我们是在进行建设，最需要学习专业知识和管理知识，学习马克思主义理论有什么实际意义？”邓小平同志指出，这是一种误解。马列主义、毛泽东思想是我们行动的指南，是夺取革命和建设胜利的重要保证。我们现在要建设有中国特色的社会主义，时代和任务不同了，要学习的新知识确实很多，这就更要求我们努力针对新的实际，掌握马克思主义基本理论。因为只有这样，才能提高我们运用它的基本方法，来积极探索解决新的政治经济社会文化基本问题的本领，既把我们的事业和马克思主义理论本身推向前进，也防止一些同志，特别是一些新上来的中青年同志在日益复杂的斗争中迷失方向。只有这样，我们党才能坚持社会主义道路，建设和发展有中国特色的社会主义，一直达到我们的最后目的，实现共产主义。
    怎样学习马列主义、毛泽东思想？邓小平同志指出：（一）要完整地、准确地学习，把学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的科学著作同学习毛泽东同志的科学著作结合起来，善于学习、掌握和运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，既不能借口情况变化而否定马克思主义理论对现代化建设的指导作用，也不能搞“两个凡是”。（二）要坚持理论联系实际的原则，把学习马克思主义的理论同社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的实际结合起来。马克思主义理论从来不是教条，而是行动的指南。它要求人们根据它的基本原则和基本方法，不断结合变化着的实际，探索解决问题的新答案，从而发展马克思主义理论本身。
  （三）要把毛泽东思想和毛泽东同志晚年的错误区别开来。我们坚持的和要当作行动指南的是毛泽东思想的基本原理，或者说是由这些基本原理构成的科学体系。毛泽东同志晚年的错误不属于毛泽东思想的基本原理所构成的科学体系。
        继承思想政治工作的优良传统，总结新经
    验，创造新方法
    邓小平同志告诫我们，加强思想政治工作，并不是再重复过去“左”的老路，而是要适应新的形势和任务的要求，不断改革创新。他指出，思想政治工作的根本的任务、根本的内容没有变，我们的优良传统也还是那一些。但是，时间不同了，条件不同了，对象不同了，因此解决问题的方法也不同。这就要求新时期的思想政治工作，必须把继承优良传统和改革创新结合起来，不断研究新情况，解决新问题，总结新经验，创造新办法。在这个方面，邓小平同志以下的一些思想值得注意。
      （一）透彻说理，从容讨论的方法。邓小平同志指出，用大搞群众运动的办法，而不是用透彻说理、从容讨论的办法，去解决群众性的思想教育问题，从来都不是成功的。透彻说理、从容讨论的方法，就是说服教育的方法、民主的方法。正确运用这个方法，首先，教育者要掌握马克思主义的基本理论，学会用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法回答干部群众提出的问题，以理服人。其次，要发扬民主，广开言路，坚持不抓辫子、不扣帽子、不打棍子。再次，要彻底否定过去那种简单片面、粗暴过火的所谓批判，以及残酷斗争、无情打击的处理方法。
      （二）区分层次，因人施教的方法。邓小平同志指出，我们在鼓励帮助每个人勤奋努力的同时，仍然不能不承认各个人在成长过程中所表现出来的政治觉悟与才能和品德的差异，并且按照这种差异给以区别对待，尽可能使每个人按不同的条件向社会主义和共产主义的总目标前进。要针对每个单位、每个人的不同情况去做思想政治工作。
      （三）联系实际，据实讲解的方法。邓小平同志指出，教育一定要联系实际。对一部分干部和群众中流行的影响社会风气的重要思想问题，要经过充分调查研究，由适当的人进行周到细致、有充分说服力的教育，简单片面武断的说法是不行的。群众关心的实际生活问题和时事政策问题，各级领导一定要经常据实讲解，告诉大家客观的情况以及党和政府所作的努力，并且对群众所反映的不合理现象及时纠正。群众从事实上感觉到党和社会主义好，这样，理想纪律教育，共产主义思想教育和爱国主义教育才会有效。
      （四）批评和自我批评的方法。这一方法本来是我们党的优良传统，但是由于“左”的影响和资产阶级自由化的干扰，一些同志对错误倾向不敢批评，而一批评有人就说是打棍子。现在开展批评很不容易，自我批评更不容易。针对这种情况，邓小平同志明确指出，批评的武器一定不能丢，决不能把批评看成是打棍子。要允许批评，允许反批评。批评和自我批评都要站在马克思主义的立场上，不能站在“左”的立场上。共产党员和党的干部要带头进行批评与自我批评，党内不论什么人，不论职务高低，都要能接受批评和进行自我批评。
      （五）思想教育和解决实际问题相结合的方法。邓小平同志指出，革命精神是非常宝贵的，没有革命精神就没有革命行动。但是，革命是在物质利益的基础上产生的，如果只讲牺牲精神，不讲物质利益，那就是唯心论。因此，一方面要注意加强思想教育，提高人民群众的思想觉悟；另一方面要关心人民群众的生活，注意解决实际问题，对于一时难于解决的问题要向人民群众解释清楚。
      （六）思想教育和严格法纪相结合的方法。邓小平同志指出，没有法制不行，加强法制重要的是进行教育，根本问题是教育人。对犯错误的人，在进行思想教育帮助的基础上对情节严重者必须作出严肃的处理。该开除党籍的就开除党籍，该给撤职或其他处分的就给这些处分，犯罪的还得法办。对学生闹事，主要采取疏导的方法是必要的。但是，如果影响了社会秩序，触犯了刑律，就必须坚决处理。疏导，包括法律的处理。
    （七）发动全社会各方面的力量都来做思想政治工作。邓小平同志向来认为，思想政治工作是群众性的工作，各级党委、各级领导干部、每个党员，各级政府、工会、妇联、共青团等组织和所有从事教育工作的同志都要做。军队的思想政治工作，军队所有的军事人员、政治人员、后勤人员都要做。思想文化界要多出好的产品，要坚决制止坏产品的生产、进口和流传。报刊、广播、电视都要把提高人民特别是青年的社会主义觉悟，作为自己的一项经常的基本任务。社会主义文艺，要通过有血有肉、生动感人的艺术形象，真实地反映丰富的社会生活，反映各种社会关系的本质，表现时代前进的要求和历史发展的趋势，并努力用社会主义思想教育人民。思想战线上的战士，都应当是人类灵魂工程师，应当高举马克思主义的、社会主义的旗帜，用自己的文章、作品、教学、讲演、表演，教育和引导人民正确地对待历史，认识现实，坚信社会主义和党的领导，鼓舞人民奋发努力，为社会主义现代化建设事业而英勇奋斗。
      言行一致，以身作则，言传和身教相结合，
  身教重于言教
    邓小平同志指出：思想政治工作“要做得有针对性、细致深入和为群众所乐于接受。最重要的条件，就是凡是需要动员群众做的，每个党员，特别是担负领导职务的党员，必须首先从自己做起。”（第301页）邓小平同志之所以强调这一点，主要是因为思想政治工作是教育人的工作，群众对教育者总是要听其言、观其行的，如果教育者言行不一，思想政治工作就必然缺乏说服力。言行一致，以身作则，言传和身教相结合，身教重于言教，是思想政治工作的优良传统和重要原则。榜样的力量是无穷的。如果每个共产党员都能以身作则，我们的一切事情就都好办了。
    邓小平同志特别强调高级干部要以身作则。他指出，高级干部能不能以身作则，影响是很大的。群众的眼睛都在盯着他们，他们做好了，下面就好办。我们有些高级干部不仅自己搞特殊化，而且影响到自己的亲属和子女，把他们都带坏了。人民群众反对特殊化，下面干部反对特殊化，首先是对着我们这些高级干部的。因此，整顿党风，搞好民风，先要从我们高级
  干部整起。
    邓小平同志指出，政治干部更要以身作则，我们过去在战争年代就是这样。那时，你打仗不勇敢，怕死，你不同战士心
  连心，不联系实际，做政治工作就没有人听。政治干部不能说
  的是一套，做的又是一套。在新历史条件下，我们要恢复和发扬政治工作的优良传统，也要靠政治干部以身作则。
    共产党员和党的各级领导干部要做到以身作则，既要解决思想问题，也要解决制度问题，而制度问题更带有根本性、全局性、稳定性和长期性。因此，必须在加强思想教育的同时，
  加强制度建设。对各级干部的职权范围和政治、生活待遇，要
  制定各种条例，要有专门的机构进行铁面无私的监督检查。
