Xinhua News Agency, Duisburg, August 25th.

The rowing heats of the World University Games took place today. In addition to the women's lightweight double sculls, which secured the first place in the preliminary round yesterday and directly advanced to the finals, the Chinese team also qualified for the finals in three other events: women's single sculls, women's quadruple sculls, and men's lightweight quadruple sculls.

This morning, the women's single sculls heats were held. Chinese athlete Zhang Li, in the second group, competed against strong opponents from the Soviet Union, Belgium, and France. She remained undaunted and kept pace with the Soviet athlete throughout the race, ultimately finishing second in her group with a time of 8 minutes 10.77 seconds.

In the afternoon, the women's quadruple sculls heats commenced. The Chinese team took the lead after the first 500 meters, surpassing the Dutch team, and by the 1000-meter mark, they had also overtaken the West German team. Amidst cheers from her teammates and coach, the Chinese team crossed the finish line first, recording a time of 6 minutes 57.74 seconds.

The Chinese team also participated in the men's lightweight quadruple sculls and quadruple sculls heats. In the quadruple sculls event, athletes Fang Shengqiang and his teammates were highly motivated, leading for the first 500 meters and keeping pace with the Spanish team at the 1000-meter mark. However, in the final 500 meters, the Spanish team increased their stroke rate, and the experienced Italian team caught up, leaving the Chinese team in third place in their group, securing a spot in the finals. In the men's quadruple sculls heats, the Chinese team held an advantage for the first 1000 meters but lost steam in the second half, missing out on a spot in the finals. After the race, coach Gao Hongyin told reporters that the team had the potential to finish in the top six but had overstroked in the first half, affecting their sprint in the second half. The loss was due to a lack of experience.

The Chinese team competed in a total of seven events. In addition to the women's lightweight double sculls and open-level quadruple sculls, which directly advanced to the finals, the Chinese team secured final spots in six events.

Tomorrow, the semifinals for men's lightweight single sculls, men's double sculls, and double sculls will be held. The finals for the other events will take place the day after tomorrow.

    世界大学生运动会赛艇复赛
    中国选手获六项决赛权
    新华社杜伊斯堡8月25日电  （记者江红）世界大学生运动会赛艇比赛今天进行了复赛。中国队除昨天的女子轻量级双人双桨获预赛小组的第一名直接进入决赛外，今天又有女子单人双桨、4人双桨和男子轻量级4人双桨3个项目获得争夺前6名的决赛权。
    今天上午进行了女子单人双桨的复赛，中国队员张丽在第二组与实力较强的苏联、比利时和法国选手相遇，毫不畏惧，自始至终一直咬住苏联选手紧跟不放，最后以8分10秒77获小组第二名。
    下午首先进行的是女子4人双桨复赛，中国队前500米就甩掉了荷兰队，划到1000米时又超过了联邦德国队，最后在队友和教练的加油声中，第一个冲过终点，成绩是6分57秒74。
    男子轻量级4人单桨和4人双桨中国队都参加了复赛。4人双桨项目的方善强等4名选手今天干劲十足，前500米曾一度领先，1000米时仍与西班牙选手并驾齐驱，最后500米，西班牙队加快桨频，经验丰富的意大利选手也迎头赶上，中国队以微弱劣势居小组第三名，获得决赛权。在男子4人单桨复赛中，中国队前1000米曾占有优势，但后半程体力不支，失去决赛权。赛后教练高洪银对记者说，他们本来有进前六名的实力，但由于前半程桨频过快，影响了后半程的冲刺。输就输在经验不足上。
    中国队这次共参加了7个项目的比赛，加上女子轻量级双人单桨和公开级4人单桨直接进入决赛，中国队共有6个项目获得决赛资格。
    明天，将进行男子轻量级单人双桨、男子双人单桨和双人双桨的半决赛。其它项目将于后天直接进行决赛。
