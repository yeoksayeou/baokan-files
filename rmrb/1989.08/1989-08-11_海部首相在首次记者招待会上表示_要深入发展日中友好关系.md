Prime Minister Kaifu Junichiro today said that Japan and China have a long history of exchanges. The two countries will develop long-term friendly relations based on the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People’s Republic of China. China will always be an important neighbor. Japan will cooperate positively with China’s current policy of reform and opening up, and strive to deepen the friendly relations between the two countries.

This was Kaifu’s view when he responded to a question from our reporter about future Sino-Japanese relations during his first press conference at the Prime Minister’s Official Residence this afternoon.

When asked about the cabinet’s policy and the basic stance of the new cabinet, Kaifu said that the most important thing for the new cabinet is dialogue and reform. When forming the cabinet, he paid attention to appointing people with clear images who can engage in dialogue and those who are eager to reform policies. To better communicate with the people, a woman was appointed as a minister. Efforts were made to form a cabinet that meets the people’s expectations. When explaining the basic principles of the new cabinet’s diplomacy, Kaifu said that Japan-U.S. relations are the axis of Japan’s diplomacy. Japan is a member of the Western countries, but at the same time, it is also a member of Asia. Japan and the Soviet Union agreed to study the issue of General Secretary Gorbachev’s visit to Japan next year. He welcomed the General Secretary’s visit to Japan and expressed his hope to visit the United States as soon as possible.

Regarding the issue of the Japanese Emperor’s visit to China, Kaifu said that because it involves many international issues, he plans to study the situation after some time.

When talking about the issue of visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, Kaifu said that after considering the past circumstances comprehensively, he decided not to visit this time.

When asked about his views on a local newspaper’s report today about the prime minister’s scandal, Kaifu said that it was completely fabricated. Such irresponsible reports are unpleasant and even infuriating. He has formally notified the newspaper to withdraw the report and apologize.

Prime Minister Kaifu also answered reporters’ questions regarding domestic political and economic issues.
