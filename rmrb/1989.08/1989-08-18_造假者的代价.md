The 43rd chapter of "Water Margin" features a fake Li Kui. The fake Li Kui falsely used Li Kui's reputation to commit highway robbery, only to meet his end under the true Li Kui's blade. That was a novel, a work of fiction. Recently, a fake "Pigsy" performing in Dan Dong was fined for deceiving the audience (according to Xinhua News Agency on August 12th). This is news, a fact.

Art is often a blend of reality and fiction, truth and falsehood. It is said that in the West, someone once organized a contest to see who could best impersonate Charlie Chaplin. The real Chaplin participated and only came in third. Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, yet countless readers worship him as a hero, erecting statues and memorials as if he were a real person. There are many such instances, proving the adage "When falsehood becomes truth, truth becomes falsehood." The principle of "seeming yet not seeming" advocated by the great Chinese painter Qi Baishi is indeed the pursuit of many artists!

In theory, portraying "Pigsy" is not the exclusive right of Ma Dexiang (the actor who played Pigsy in the TV series "Journey to the West"). Why then is it considered "fake"? Because the audience comes to see Ma Dexiang's "Pigsy" and the original cast of the TV series. People cannot tolerate "passing off false as true" or "passing off false as false"! If the poster had stated that Ma Dexiang could not come and someone else would take his place, who could say that this Pigsy must be Ma Dexiang? But the promoter, fearing a drop in box office revenue, tried to deceive the audience, which is akin to mocking them and inviting trouble. Although the stage version of the Monkey King might turn a blind eye (I suspect that eye is blinded by money), pretending not to know that Pigsy is a fake, the audience will not tolerate sand in their eyes!

This leads me to think about the current state of the music industry, which, besides bel canto, folk singing, and popular singing, also includes a form of "fake voice singing." Although the recorded voice may sound melodious, the performer does not actually sing but merely mimics the act of singing. Those in the know say they are performing a "double act" with the recording. It seems that this deception is not limited to fake cigarettes, fake alcohol, and counterfeit goods; even "fake voices" and "fake Pigsy" can make an appearance. In recent years, some touring performances have been purely for profit, leading to improper stage manners, incomplete casts, unequal distribution of earnings, tax evasion, deceit, and desecration of art. These chaotic phenomena must be rectified!

For performers who are disseminators of spiritual civilization, acting can be fake, but being a person must be genuine! Those who act falsely should take heed of the fake "Pigsy."

    造假者的代价
    张半解
    《水浒传》第43回写了一个假李逵。假李逵假借李逵之威而走剪径之险，岂料撞在了真李逵刀下。那是小说，或属虚构。近日出了一个走穴丹东的假“猪八戒”，因欺骗观众而被课以罚款（据新华社8月12日电）。这是新闻，真确无疑了。
    这艺术上本来是虚实模糊、真假迷离的。据说西方曾有好事者组织过一次看谁扮演卓别林像的比赛，真卓别林混迹其中，却只得了个第3名。福尔摩斯本是作家柯南道尔虚构的人物，却被无数读者奉为英雄，为他塑像立碑，当做实在的人去纪念。这类事儿多了，可谓“假做真时真亦假，真做假时假亦真”。国画大师齐白石的“似与不似”说，正是众多艺术家追求的境界呢！
    按说这扮演“猪八戒”并非马德华（电视连续剧《西游记》中猪八戒的扮演者）的专利，换了怎的就“假”了呢？因为观众是冲着马德华的“猪八戒”，也是冲着电视剧组的“原班人马”来的，人们不能容忍“以假乱真”，也不能容忍“以假乱假”！倘若海报中声明马德华因故未来，换了别个，谁又能说这猪八戒“非马莫属”呢？但穴头怕影响票房收入而李代桃僵，妄图蒙混过关，这无异于戏弄观众而招致大哗。尽管舞台上火眼金睛的孙悟空睁一只眼闭一只眼（我想那只眼是金钱障目），佯装不知八戒是假，但观众眼里可不揉沙子！
    遂联想今日歌坛除了美声唱法、民族唱法、通俗唱法外，竟还有一种“假声唱法”。尽管音响里歌声悠扬，但演员并不用嗓，只做发声状，知底细的说他们是和录音带演“双簧”。看来这糊弄人的事儿不独假烟假酒赝品充市，连“假声”、以致“假八戒”也可纷纷出场的。近几年，一些走穴演出专以赢利赚钱为目的，以致台风不正、阵容不整、分“赃”不均、偷税漏税、弄虚做假、亵渎艺术，这些混乱现象，实在已到了非整顿不可的时候了！
    就精神文明传播者的演员而言，做戏可假，但做人可要真！做人假者，请以假“猪八戒”者戒。
