The current sudden drop in tourism in China has caused concern, but it should also prompt us to reflect.

Ups and Downs Are Inevitable

Perhaps the development of China's tourism industry over the past decade has been too smooth, with nearly double-digit growth rates year after year. "China's tourism resources are unique and attractive, so the development momentum should be like this, right?" Many people have long held this mindset. When a sudden event occurs, they are completely unprepared, their minds suddenly unbalanced, and they fall into confusion. Thus, some panic, others are at a loss, some are discouraged, and others "desperately" try anything...

In fact, by examining the development trajectory of some tourism-developed countries in the world, one can find that various sudden events will, to a certain extent, hinder the progress of the tourism industry within a specific time and space. No country can maintain a straight-line upward trajectory. People often refer to the tourism industry as a sensitive and fragile sector.

Due to various sudden events being limited to specific times and regions, the global tourism industry as a whole still maintains a stable and continuous growth trend. This is because many countries' economies are continuing to develop, people's incomes are increasing, paid vacations are being extended, and traveling abroad is becoming an essential part of people's lives. Therefore, experts predict that by the end of the century, the total output value of the global tourism industry will surpass the oil and automotive industries to become the world's largest industry. In this favorable environment, generally speaking, any country's slump can only be a temporary phenomenon.

There Are Established Countermeasures

The frequent occurrence of sudden events has come at a high cost but has also yielded rich experience in dealing with them.

Currently, internationally accepted countermeasures include: holding emergency meetings to discuss strategies; establishing special task forces to take action; setting up information clarification systems to dispel misinformation or rumors; using news media to establish and spread positive public opinion; inviting foreign travel agencies to conduct on-site inspections to dispel their doubts and restore their confidence; researching, designing, and promoting new, attractive products; increasing promotional and marketing funds; launching targeted promotional campaigns; offering limited-time discounts on airfare, accommodation, and meals; rectifying internal issues, improving quality, and preparing for the recovery and revitalization of the tourism industry.

These measures have been proven effective in practice. Therefore, as long as effective measures are taken based on the actual situation of the country, region, and the international background at the time, the situation can be gradually reversed, turning danger into safety.

Use the Opportunity for Adjustment

The temporary slump in tourist numbers has led to a downturn in the tourism industry, which is undoubtedly bad. However, it also has another side.

First, it breaks the mindset of smooth sailing and begins to cultivate a sense of preparedness and adaptability. Through the practice of adaptation, a mechanism and ability to respond to changes will be established and improved.

Second, it serves as a cooling agent for the out-of-control construction of hotels. In recent years, repeated calls to coordinate and control the blind construction of hotels have had little effect, but this time, due to the significant drop in tourist numbers, it has been automatically adjusted.

Moreover, the slump brings difficulties but also opportunities. If these years have been too busy to handle everything due to overloading, then now there is ample time and energy to rectify internal issues, improve and enhance management and service. If a new image can be presented in the international tourism market through this, "retreat one step, advance two steps," bad things can turn into good things.

Addressing the Root Cause for Revival

While studying and addressing the current slump, we must not overlook long-standing, unresolved inherent contradictions.

In recent years, our primary tourist source country, Japan, has seen a year-on-year decline in market share, with figures for 1985, 1986, and 1987 being 9.6%, 8.9%, and 8.5% respectively. Last year, the decline continued to widen. Another major tourist market, the United States, saw a decline for the first time last year, decreasing by 4.6%. The imbalance between transportation and tourism has led to bottlenecks in the channels for tourists, and management errors in tourism have resulted in a decline in service quality, both of which have damaged China's reputation in the international tourism market.

To cure long-standing ailments, we must thoroughly and seriously reflect, adjust, clean up, rectify, and train... fundamentally optimize the management mechanism, eliminate chaos, corruption, and unhealthy practices in the industry, and improve the quality of the team; comprehensively plan and coordinate the development of transportation to ensure it keeps pace with tourism, and adjust the development speed to the optimal state.

Although the path is arduous, it is necessary to save and revitalize China's tourism industry. Only by making a firm decision, setting aside concerns, and prioritizing the future of the tourism industry, can we work together, face difficulties head-on, and implement various root-cause measures with solid steps. Then, there is hope for a gradual recovery next year, and by 1991, we can return to the 1988 level. After 1992, a new and thriving period will emerge.

    旅游业滑坡浅议
    李海瑞
    目前中国旅游客源突然跌落的状况，引起人们的忧虑，但更应引起我们的思考。
    波折谁也难免
    也许10年来我国旅游业发展太顺利了，几乎年年都是两位数的增长率。“中国旅游资源得天独厚，吸引力大，发展的势头就应该是这个样子的吧。”不少人长期处于这种心态，一旦出现突发事件，毫无思想准备，心理猛然失衡，陷入困惑。于是，或惊慌失措，或无所适从，或沮丧不振，或“病急”乱投医……
    其实，追寻世界上一些旅游发达国家的发展轨迹，可以发现，各种突发事件都会在一定的时空范围内阻遏旅游业的前进。没有一国能始终保持直线上升的记录。人们常把旅游业称做敏感的、脆弱的行业。
    由于各种突发事件只限于一定时间内的局部地区，在总体上世界旅游业仍保持稳定持续增长的势头。这是因为当今世界许多国家的经济在继续发展，人们收入在增加，有薪假期在延长，外出旅游，越来越成为人们的生活必需。所以，专家们预测到本世纪末时，全世界旅游业总产值将超过石油业和汽车业而成为世界第一大产业。处于良好的大气候中，一般说，任何一个国家的滑坡都只能是暂时现象。
    应变已有成套招数
    此起彼伏的突发事件，付出了昂贵的代价，换来了丰富的应变经验。
    目前国际通用的应变措施有：召开紧急会议，研究对策；成立应变特别小组，采取行动；建立信息澄清系统，消除误传或谣言；借助新闻媒介，确立和传播正面舆论；邀请外国旅行商实地考察，打消其疑虑，恢复其信心；研究、设计、推出令人耳目一新的富有吸引力的新产品；追加巨额宣传促销经费；发动有针对性的宣传促销攻势；机票、房费、餐费提供有限期的优惠价格；整顿内部，提高素质，为复苏和重振旅游业作准备。
    这些措施已被实践证明是行之有效的。可见只要根据本国本地和当时国际背景的实际情况，采取得力措施，就能逐步扭转局势，转危为安。
    利用时机进行调整
    客源暂时滑坡造成旅游业萧条，固然是坏事，但它还有另一面。
    首先破除了一帆风顺的思维模式，开始培植居安思危的意识和应变意识。经过应变实践的锻炼，将建立和健全应变机制，增强应变能力。
    其次是给失控的饭店建造热一服清凉剂。近年来曾三令五申要求协调和控制饭店的盲目建造，奏效不大，这次却因客源大滑坡得以自动调节。
    再就是大滑坡带来困难的同时也带来机遇。如果说这些年由于超负载运转而腾不出手，那末，现在已有充裕的时间和精力来整顿内部，改善、提高管理与服务。如能由此而以崭新的面貌出现在国际旅游市场，“退一步，进两步”，坏事未尝不能变成好事。
    治本方能复兴
    在研究和对付眼前的滑坡时，切莫掩盖存在已久、又未能及时解决的固有矛盾。
    近年来，我们的第一客源国日本的市场份额逐年下降，1985至1987年分别为9.6％、8.9％和8.5％，去年下降的幅度继续增大。我另一主要客源市场美国，去年第一次亮起红灯，减少了4.6％。交通与旅游失衡带来的输客渠道梗阻，旅游管理失误造成的服务质量退化，都使我国在国际旅游市场的声誉下降。
    要根治多年积累的顽症，必须彻底和认真地反思、调整、清理、整顿、培训……从根本上优化管理机制，清除行业的混乱、腐败和不正之风，改善、提高队伍素质；从总体上规划好与交通发展协调同步，把发展速度调整至最佳状态。
    尽管步履维艰，但非如此不足以拯救和重振我国的旅游业。唯有痛下决心，抛却顾虑，以旅游业的前途为重，上下一心，知难而进，脚踏实地地落实各项治本措施，那末，明年逐步复苏，1991年恢复到1988年的水平是有希望的，1992年以后将出现一个令人振奋的新的兴旺期。
