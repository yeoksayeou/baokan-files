Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 24th.

Poland's new Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said in a policy statement before his appointment by the parliament today that the current poor economic situation is the biggest problem facing the government.

In his statement to the parliament, he said that the long-term strategic goal of the government he will form is to restore the market economy and make the country function similarly to economically developed countries.

He said that restoring the balance of supply and demand and curbing inflation is a major economic task, as well as a political and social task.

To this end, the government will take a series of measures to improve the methods that have been adopted so far in Poland and other countries.

When discussing foreign policy, Mazowiecki expressed the hope that Poland's friends would understand the country's efforts to restore the economy.

He said that the Polish government "desires to maintain friendly and good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union" and understands the significance of the obligations arising from the Warsaw Pact. He solemnly declared to all member countries that the Polish government will honor this pact.

After being appointed Prime Minister by the parliament, Mazowiecki said at a press conference held at the government building that the new government faces "a pile of problems and difficulties." Solving these problems and difficulties requires the new government to unite all political and social forces, work together, and strive together. He said that while the new government is implementing the principle of joint governance by Solidarity, the United Peasants Party, and the Democratic Party, it must also seek cooperation with the Polish United Workers' Party to jointly shoulder the responsibility for the fate of the Polish nation, because in the specific conditions of Poland, "the role of the Polish United Workers' Party cannot be ignored."

The new Prime Minister expressed that the Polish government supports the reforms in the Soviet Union and hopes to improve "friendly and good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union." He expects Western countries, especially the United States, to further develop "comprehensive cooperation" with Poland.

    马佐维耶茨基谈波兰内外政策
    据新华社华沙8月24日电　波兰新总理塔·马佐维耶茨基今天在议会任命之前发表的施政声明中说，当前波兰糟糕的经济状况是政府面临的最大问题。
    他在向议会发表的声明中说，他将组建的政府的长期战略目标是恢复市场经济，让国家起近似于经济发达国家那样的作用。
    他说，恢复供求平衡和遏制通货膨胀是一项重大的经济任务，也是一项政治和社会任务。
    为此，政府将采取一系列措施，使迄今在波兰和其他国家采取的办法完善起来。
    在谈到对外政策时，马佐维耶茨基表示希望波兰的朋友们理解波兰为恢复经济所做的一切。
    他说，波兰政府“渴望维护同苏联的睦邻友好关系”，理解华沙条约所产生的义务的意义。他向它的所有成员国郑重宣布，波兰政府将信守这一条约。
    在议会任命他为总理之后，马佐维耶茨基在政府大厦举行的记者招待会上说，新政府面临“成堆问题和困难”，解决这些问题和困难需要新政府联合所有政治和社会力量，齐心协力，共同奋斗。他说，新政府执行团结工会、统一农民党和民主党联合执政原则的同时，必须争取与统一工人党合作，为波兰国家的命运“共同承担责任”，因为在波兰具体条件下“不能不重视统一工人党的作用”。
    这位新总理表示，波兰政府支持苏联的改革，希望改善“同苏联的睦邻友好关系”。他期望西方各国，特别是美国，进一步发展与波兰的“全面合作”。
