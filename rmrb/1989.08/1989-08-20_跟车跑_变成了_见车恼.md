Recently, while conducting an investigation in Huangzun Township, Suyang County, Jiangsu Province, I heard a story about how "following cars to get business" turned into "seeing cars brings annoyance."

The story goes that about 200 meters away from the Huangzun Township government, there is a restaurant on Huangzun Street. The owner of the restaurant is quite clever. Previously, when officials from higher levels came, the township often brought them to the restaurant for meals. After understanding this "pattern," whenever he saw a car pass by, he would follow it to the township government to proactively arrange for banquets and meals. Coupled with the prevalent practice of feasting in society, his business flourished, with a monthly gross income of three to four thousand yuan. Over time, "following cars to get business" became famous.

However, since early July this year, "following cars to get business" no longer worked. It turned out that the Suyang County Party Committee and government, in their efforts to promote clean governance, issued a regulation that officials visiting the grassroots level are not allowed to accept public-funded banquets and must dine in the communal dining hall. Both the hosts and guests who violate this regulation will be dealt with according to the circumstances. The county also distributed this regulation to county-level departments, factories, enterprises, and all grassroots units throughout the county, asking the public to supervise it. The township also made similar regulations. In July, more than 10 leaders from the county Party Committee, county government, and relevant departments visited the township to inspect disaster situations and guide work, but the township did not host a single banquet. Township and village officials, as well as township-level department staff, rarely patronized the restaurant. The restaurant's business became sluggish.

"Following cars to get business" no longer brought in business, and seeing cars only brought annoyance over the lack of customers. Someone joked with the restaurant owner, "'Following cars to get business' has now turned into 'seeing cars brings annoyance.'"

### “跟车跑”变成了“见车恼”

    “跟车跑”变成了“见车恼”
    庄勇
    最近到江苏泗阳县黄圩乡搞调查，听到一个“跟车跑”变成“见车恼”的故事。
    故事说，在距黄圩乡政府200余米远的黄圩街头有一家饭店，店主人脑瓜子挺活。以前，上头来人，乡里经常带到饭店招待。他掌握这个“规律”以后，一见小车从门前过，就跟在车后撵到乡政府，主动联系承办酒席、饭菜。加上社会上吃喝风盛行，所以，他的生意十分兴隆，每月毛收入达三四千元。久而久之，“跟车跑”就出名了。
    可是，从今年7月初起，“跟车跑”不灵了。原来泗阳县委县政府在廉政建设中，作出了机关干部下基层不准接受公款宴请，一律在大食堂就餐的规定，对违反规定的主、客双方，都要视情处理。县里还把这个规定印发到县直机关，以及工厂企业和全县各基层单位，交群众监督。乡里也相应制定了类似规章制度。7月份，县委、县政府及县有关部门领导到这个乡察看灾情，检查指导工作10多人次，乡里没宴请一次。乡村及乡直机关干部也很少有人到饭店光顾。饭店的生意清淡了。
    “跟车跑”跑不来生意，一见来车就为生意冷落而懊恼。有人跟店主人开玩笑：“‘跟车跑’，如今成了‘见车恼’。”
