Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 28th.

In the northern metropolis of Tianjin, many infectious diseases have been controlled or eradicated. Each year, only 2.29% of deaths are attributed to infectious diseases, removing them from the top five causes of death. The incidence rate of infectious diseases is 540.6 per 100,000 people, a reduction of 78.29% compared to the 1950s.

Currently, aside from cholera and smallpox, which have been eliminated from Tianjin, significant progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of serious diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, and measles.

    天津控制传染病有成效
    据新华社天津8月28日电　（记者孙永盛）在北方大城市天津，由于许多传染病得到控制或被消灭，每年死于传染病的仅占死亡人口的2.29％，退出死亡原因的前5位，传染病发病率为十万分之540.6，比50年代下降78.29％。
    现在，除霍乱、天花已在天津绝迹外，一些严重危害人体健康的肺结核、白喉、麻疹等都取得很好的防治效果。
