Soviet Defense Minister Yazov believes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is still pursuing a policy of strength, and therefore significant efforts are needed to build a peaceful Europe.

Helsinki, August 13 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Finnish newspaper "Helsingin Sanomat" today, Soviet Defense Minister Yazov believes that the West has not yet abandoned traditional clichés and patterns such as nuclear deterrence strategy. He said, "The recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council still adheres to the policy of strength. We still have a lot of work to do to pave the way for the establishment of a new, peaceful Europe."

Yazov made these remarks in an interview with a reporter from the newspaper before his visit to Finland. At the invitation of Finnish Defense Minister Norberg, he will begin an official three-day visit to Finland starting August 16.

In discussing the issue of arms reduction, Yazov confirmed that the Soviet Union's proposals for arms reduction and its military doctrine of defense have made it possible to reduce military spending. By 1995, the Soviet Union will reduce its defense expenditures by as much as half.

    北约仍在执行实力政策  建立和平欧洲还需努力
    新华社赫尔辛基8月13日电　据芬兰《赫尔辛基新闻》今天报道，苏联国防部长亚佐夫认为，北大西洋公约组织仍在执行实力政策，因此为建设和平的欧洲还需要做大量的工作。
    亚佐夫是在访芬前夕在莫斯科接受该报记者采访时发表上述看法的。应芬兰国防部长诺尔贝克的邀请，他将从8月16日起对芬兰进行为时3天的正式访问。
    亚佐夫认为，西方尚未摆脱传统的陈词滥调和诸如核威慑战略那样的模式。他说，“北约组织理事会最近召开的会议仍然奉行实力政策。我们还有很多的事情要作，以便能够为建立新的、和平的欧洲扫清道路。”
    在谈到裁军问题时，亚佐夫证实，苏联的裁军倡议和以防御为目的的军事学说使削减军费成为可能。到1995年，苏联将把国防开支甚至削减一半。
