A Hezbollah leader today called for the release of hostages, which was welcomed by the United States.

Fadlallah, in a speech at a mosque in the southern suburbs of Beirut, said that if Western countries could help release Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, he would be willing to assist in the release of Western hostages. He called for: Let us work together to end the hostage issue forever.

White House spokesman Fitzwater said this is an interesting statement, but he also said that the release of hostages is a long process, "We need patience and repeated discussions."

State Department spokesman Redman said that any party that can assist in the immediate and unconditional release of hostages is welcome.
