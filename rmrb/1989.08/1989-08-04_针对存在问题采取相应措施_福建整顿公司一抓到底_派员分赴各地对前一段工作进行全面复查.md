Focusing on existing problems and taking corresponding measures, Fujian will thoroughly rectify companies.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Province recently decided to take specific measures to thoroughly rectify the company cleanup work.

Since October of last year, 7,739 companies in Fujian Province have been included in this cleanup and rectification scope. After more than eight months of cleanup, 895 companies have been dissolved, 126 have been merged, and 395 have been downgraded. However, some companies and their supervising departments have not fully recognized the importance of this work. Some companies continue to engage in illegal business activities, and although there are public complaints, the relevant departments still insist on keeping them. Some companies have formally decoupled but are still informally connected; a few companies have not been investigated or reported at all. Some issues involve fiscal system problems, where investigations are conducted far away but not nearby, or on others but not on themselves.

To address the above problems, the following specific measures have been decided:

	* Organize joint inspection teams to conduct a comprehensive re-inspection of the previous phase of company cleanup and rectification work in various cities and counties. The inspection teams will be composed of personnel from the provincial discipline inspection commission, supervision, audit, finance, taxation, banking, and industrial and commercial departments, and will invite representatives from the provincial advisory commission, provincial people's congress, and provincial political consultative conference to participate in the inspection work. The public will also be encouraged to report any issues.
	* For large companies that do not meet the conditions for operation, have significant public complaints, are poorly managed, operate poorly, or engage in illegal business activities, the provincial audit bureau will first conduct an audit, and then handle them according to their specific situations.
	* Strengthen the investigation and handling of economic cases. Deeply investigate cases of collusion between officials and enterprises, and the illegal trading of important materials, as well as major cases discovered during the cleanup. Each case will be thoroughly investigated and seriously handled, with the results made public. It is strictly forbidden to use fines as a substitute for criminal penalties.
	* Address the issue of mixed ownership of some companies.
	* Companies that need to be retained after the cleanup will be re-registered. The industrial and commercial administrative management department will strictly control the registration and approval process, and no unit or individual will be allowed to interfere.
	* For companies that have been dissolved, merged, or downgraded, the level of cleanup will determine which level issues the announcement.

    针对存在问题采取相应措施
    福建整顿公司一抓到底
    派员分赴各地对前一段工作进行全面复查
    据新华社福州8月4日电  （记者张瑞三）福建省日前决定采取具体措施，把清理整顿公司工作进行到底。
    自去年10月以来，福建省列入这次清理整顿范围的有7739家公司，经过8个多月的清理，已撤销公司895家，合并126家，降格395家。但是，少数公司和主管部门对这项工作的重要性认识不足。有些公司违法经营活动，群众有意见，但有关部门仍要求继续保留；有的明脱钩暗不脱钩；极个别的公司至今不查不报。有的涉及财政体制问题，查远不查近，查他不查己。
    针对以上问题，决定采取具体措施：
    ——组织联合检查组，分赴各地市对前段清理整顿公司工作进行一次全面的复查，检查组由省纪委、监察、审计、财税、银行、工商等部门抽人组成，并邀请省顾委、省人大、省政协派人参加检查工作。并发动群众举报。
    ——对那些不具备办公司条件，群众意见很大，管理混乱，经营不善或有违法经营活动的大公司，由省审计局先进行审计，再分别情况作出处理。
    ——加强对经济案件的查处。深挖机关、企事业单位中内外勾结，投机倒卖重要物资的案件，及清理中发现的大要案，要逐个查清作出严肃处理，严禁以罚代刑，同时把处理结果公布于众。
    ——解决一些公司所有制混乱问题。
    ——经过清理需要保留的公司要重新办理登记注册，工商行政管理部门要严格把关，任何单位和个人不得干预登记审批工作。
    ——对撤销、合并、降格的公司，属于哪一级清理，由哪一级发布公告。
