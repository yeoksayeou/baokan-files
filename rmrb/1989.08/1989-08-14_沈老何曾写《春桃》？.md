A theater posted a movie advertisement, with large, bold letters stating: "Tonight, screening the film 'Spring Peach,' adapted from the original novel by famous writer Shen Congwen, starring renowned actor ×××..." I was bewildered and went to ask the ticket seller: "'Spring Peach' is a work by Mr. Xu Dishan ('Peanut'), how did it end up attributed to Mr. Shen Congwen?" The reply was: "We don't know, it's written according to the movie company's advertisement." I became even more confused.

I thought about going to ask the movie company, but then I thought, never mind. Because I am not a judge, and I don't need to investigate thoroughly to determine the responsibility of the parties involved. What I want to point out is that even a theater writing such an advertisement lacking common sense is unforgivable. It at least tells us two things: our cultural workers have a low cultural and knowledge level; our cultural workers lack the spirit of learning and research.

I naturally thought of how a certain announcer pronounced "andzhong gongji" (andzhong meaning harmonious) as "andai gongji" (andai meaning sorrowful); in a certain TV drama, a main character pronounced "zhuizhui bu'an" (zhuizhui meaning anxious) as "chuai chuai bu'an" (chuai meaning to guess). If we expand our view to various sectors of society, the problems are even more alarming: some writers' works can do without punctuation (supposedly learned from foreigners), can be full of profanity (supposedly modern spirit), some notices can be incoherent, documents can be illogical, and as for slogans, signs, and advertisements with numerous typos, they are all too common.

All of the above reflect the decline in our general cultural standards, showing the serious harm that the ideas of "reading is useless," "knowledge is devalued," and "literati are wiped out" have on our national culture and even national spirit. If this continues, the consequences are really unthinkable!

However, someone might say: "What's the big deal? It doesn't affect eating or drinking, it's a small matter!" Indeed, compared to the Tangshan earthquake, the "Cultural Revolution," the Great Fire of Da Hinggan Ling, and the population explosion, this is indeed nothing. But if a country, a nation's cultural education is gradually declining, can such a country, such a nation achieve "modernization"? Can it "stand tall among the nations of the world"?

### 沈老何曾写《春桃》？

    沈老何曾写《春桃》？
    ××剧院贴出电影广告，核桃大字赫然写道：“今晚放映根据著名作家沈从文小说原著改编之《春桃》，由著名影星×××主演……”笔者大惑不解，前去请教售票员：“《春桃》乃许地山（即‘落花生’）先生的作品，怎末按到了沈从文先生的头上？”答曰：“我们不懂，是根据电影公司的广告写的。”我愈加困惑不解。
    本想再去请教电影公司，但转而一想，算了吧。因为我并非审判官，要去查个水落石出，以便追究当事者的责任。我只想说明的是，即使一个剧院，写出这样缺乏常识的广告，也让人无法原谅。它至少告诉人们两点：我们的文化从业人员文化水平、知识水平太低了；我们的文化从业人员学习精神、钻研精神太差了。
    我很自然地联想到，某播音员竟然把“和衷（音Zhōng）共济”念成了“和哀（音āi）共济”；在某个电视剧上，一位主角把“惴惴（音zhuì）不安”，念成“揣揣（音chuāi）不安”。如果把视野扩大到社会各界，问题就更加怵目惊心：某些作家的作品可以不要标点符号（据说学的外国人），可以骂语连篇（据说是现代精神），有的公告可以词不达意，文件可以逻辑不通，至于标语、标牌、广告之类错别字连篇，那就更是屡见不鲜了。
    以上种种，都可见出我们普遍文化水准的下降，显出新的读书无用、知识贬值、斯文扫地对我们民族文化乃至民族精神的严重戕害。这样下去，后果实在不堪设想！
    可是，有人曰：“这算什么？不当吃，不碍喝，小事一桩耳！”是的，比起唐山大地震、
  “文化大革命”、大兴安岭大火灾、人口大爆炸来，这的确算不了什么。但是，一个国家、一个民族文化教养日渐低下，这样的国家、这样的民族能够实现什么“现代化”，能够“自立于世界民族之林”吗？
