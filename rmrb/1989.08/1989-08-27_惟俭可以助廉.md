The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have recently undertaken seven major initiatives that are of great concern to the public. In particular, the specific actions taken by the principal leaders of the Party and the state, such as canceling "special supplies," using domestically produced cars, and eating working meals, have resonated strongly among the broad masses of the people. This spirit of leading by example and starting with oneself is truly commendable.

The Han Dynasty folk song "City Song" sings, "In the city, high hair is fashionable, four directions add an inch. In the city, wide eyebrows are fashionable, four directions half the forehead. In the city, large sleeves are fashionable, four directions a full bolt of cloth." This is what is meant by "when the upper class likes something, the lower class will follow suit." Today, some local party and government agencies have also made decisions to do "five things" or "ten things." I believe that this "leading by example" is very much in line with the people's wishes. Just look, in the 1950s and 1960s, it was common for county party secretaries to ride bicycles to the countryside. Now, things have truly changed. As soon as they go out, the county has "flat heads," and the township has "canvas covers." It seems like you can't go out without a car.

We do not oppose a "fast pace," and we are not saying that as soon as we mention hard work and austerity, we will suddenly make a 180-degree turn and have people go back to eating tree bark and grass roots. But the ancient adage "only frugality can aid integrity" still has some relevance. In doing things, we should especially consider the national conditions and act within our means.

"Through the ages, the rise and fall of countries and families, success comes from diligence and frugality, failure comes from extravagance." China is not rich to begin with, and we should especially advocate for diligence and frugality. Unfortunately, in recent years, the words "diligence" and "frugality" have been forgotten, and the wind of extravagance has been blowing. Naturally, "consuming ahead of time" is neither the slogan of the common people nor the lead of the masses. This lesson is worth learning. Now, the Central Committee of the Party has set a good example, but this is just the beginning. To truly gain the trust of the people, it still depends on the broad masses of people with the "long" character to follow suit.

The Tang Dynasty poet Shen Quanqi's "Fishing Rod Essay" has two lines that are very good: "To see the fragrant bait go down, greed will lead to no trap." The fish that take the bait only covet the fragrant bait and do not see or pay attention to the fishing rod. As a result, they are caught. Therefore, thick stacks of money and sweet flattery should be clearly distinguished in terms of their origin and intent. "Thick money and sweet words, these are what people fear" (Resource for Governance: Jin Dynasty). Integrity can make one's spirit clean and unburdened. Didn't Yu Qian say, "With two sleeves of clean wind, I go to the court, avoiding the short talk of the common people!" (Entering the Capital). The leaders striving for a moderately prosperous society, why not review Fang Zhimin's "Poverty" again?

### 惟俭可以助廉

    惟俭可以助廉
    党中央、国务院在近期内做七件群众普遍关心的事情，特别是党和国家主要领导人取消“特供”、乘坐国产车、吃工作餐等具体做法，在广大人民群众中引起强烈反响。这种率先垂范、从“我”做起的精神，很值得称道。
    汉乐府民歌《城中谣》唱道：“城中好高髻，四方高一尺。城中好广眉，四方且半额。城中好大袖，四方全匹帛。”此所谓“上有所好，下必甚焉”是也。时下，一些地方党政机关也纷纷作出做“五件”、“十件”的决定，余以为，此种“上行下效”甚得民心。君不见，五六十年代，县委书记骑车下乡寻常事，现在可真“旧貌换新颜”了，一出门：县里是“两头平”，乡里是“帆布篷”，真有点无车不出门的味道。
    我们不反对“快节奏”，更不是一提艰苦创业、过紧日子，就倏地来个一百八十度大转弯，让人们还去过啃树皮、吃草根的生活。但“惟俭可以助廉”的千年古训，还是有借鉴意义的。我们在办一些事情中，尤其要体察国情，讲究量力。
    “历尽前贤国与家，成由勤俭败由奢”。中国本来就不富裕，更应该提倡勤俭。可惜近几年，勤俭二字被淡忘了，奢靡之风日盛。自然，“超前消费”既非老百姓的口号，也不是群众带的头，这个教训值得吸取。如今党中央带了个好头，但仅仅是个开头，真正取信于民还要靠广大的带“长”字号的人跟着带头。
    唐代沈佺期《钓竿篇》有两句诗说得好：“为看芳饵下，贪得会无筌。”那上钩的鱼儿，只贪图芳香诱惑的鱼饵，对于捕鱼的竹器，视而不见或全然不放在眼里。其结果是被人捕捉。所以，厚搭搭的人民币，甜蜜蜜的奉承话，要清醒地辨别一下来路与企图。“币厚言甘，人之所畏也”（《资治通鉴·晋纪》）。廉洁，可以精神清爽，了无负担。于谦不是说过吗：“清风两袖朝天去，免得闾阎话短长！”（《入京》）。奔小康的带头人，何妨温习一下方志敏的《清贫》呢。　　　　　　　　　　邱文亮　姜芳
