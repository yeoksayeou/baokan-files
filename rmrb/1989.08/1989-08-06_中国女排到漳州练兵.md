The Chinese women's volleyball team arrived in Zhangzhou Sports Training Base yesterday. They will undergo a 50-day intensive summer training here. This is the sixth time the team has trained in Zhangzhou since its establishment in 1976. The main task for the Chinese women's volleyball team this year is to participate in the World Cup, which will be held in Japan in November. All the top teams in the world are preparing vigorously. This time, the Chinese team comes to train with the aim of carrying on the fighting spirit of the old women's volleyball team, enduring hardships, and striving for excellence to restore their former glory as soon as possible. Head coach Hu Jin said, "Coming here is like coming home. This is my ninth time in Zhangzhou, and most of the team members have also been here before."
