West Texas Intermediate crude oil is the benchmark oil of the United States and the main traded oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It plays a significant role in the global oil market and generally reflects the changes, fluctuations, and trends in the world oil market.

However, in recent times, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has been fluctuating frequently, which is quite different from the relatively stable situation in the current world market.

The situation shows that the price gap between West Texas Intermediate crude oil and other types of oil is widening. Taking Brent crude oil as an example, the price difference per barrel between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil was 65 cents in 1986, 70 cents in 1987, and $1 in 1988. This year, the gap has widened to $2.68–$2.73.

Compared to Dubai crude oil, another major oil in the world, the price difference between West Texas Intermediate and Dubai crude oil was $2.18 in 1986, $2.25 in 1987, $2.80 in 1988, and this year it has reached over $4. The reason for this is the current strong demand for gasoline in the United States, which has led to a tightening supply of West Texas Intermediate crude oil.

In recent years, U.S. oil production has been declining. According to a report by the Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the light oil and low-sulfur oil in the central United States are about to be depleted. Future domestic oil production in the United States will continue to decline. This makes the supply of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increasingly tight.

In addition, the recent strong domestic demand for gasoline in the United States has led to refinery operating rates reaching over 90%. The demand for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which has the highest yield, has also increased accordingly.

    西得克萨斯中质原油
    西得克萨斯中质原油是美国的基准原油，也是纽约商品交易所的主要交易原油，在世界石油市场上具有重要地位。它基本上代表和反映了世界石油市场的变化、波动和趋势。
    但是，近一个时期来，西得克萨斯中质原油的价格波动频繁，与目前世界市场较为平稳的情况大相径庭。
    情况表明，西得克萨斯中质原油的价格与其他原油的价格的差距不断扩大。以布伦特原油为例，每桶西得克萨斯中质油与布伦特原油之间的差价，1986年为65美分，1987年为70美分，1988年为1美元。而今年已扩大到2.68—2.73美元。
    西得克萨斯中质原油与世界另一主要原油迪拜油相比，1986年两者差价为2.18美元，1987年为2.25美元，1988年为2.80美元，今年则达到4美元以上。究其原因，是目前美国汽油需求旺盛，导致西得克萨斯中质原油的供应日趋紧张。
    近年来，美国原油生产呈下降趋势，据剑桥能源研究所的一份报告说，美国中部地区的轻油和低硫油即将枯竭。未来美国国内的原油生产将不断下降。这就使西得克萨斯中质原油的供应越来越紧张。
    此外，近期美国国内汽油需求旺盛，各炼油厂开工率均达90％以上。对出油率最好的西得克萨斯中质原油的需求也随之上升。
