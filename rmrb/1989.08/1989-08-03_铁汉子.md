When people talk about Wei Xiu Lin, a soldier from the 1st Platoon of the 5th Company in a certain unit of the capital's martial law troops, they all say he is a "hard man who faces difficulties head-on and dangers without hesitation."

On the night of June 3, as the advancing troops passed the first obstacle and gradually sped up, Wei Xiu Lin, carrying his rifle and ammunition, marched swiftly with his comrades.

His eyes fell on a handgun 3 meters to his left front. He quickened his pace, bent down to pick it up, but a thug kicked it to the side of the road before he could reach it. In the blink of an eye, Wei Xiu Lin leaped forward, stretching out his left hand to grab the gun. He missed by a few centimeters, and his hand was pierced by a sharp stone. He endured the pain and reached out with his right hand, lightning-fast, pressing down on the gun. The thug lifted his foot and stomped on Wei Xiu Lin's hand, grinding it with the sole of his shoe. A sharp pain shot through him, but Wei Xiu Lin gritted his teeth and held onto the gun tightly. At that moment, he had only one thought: he must not let the weapon fall into the hands of the thug.

Wei Xiu Lin took a deep breath, pulled his body forward, and suddenly grabbed the thug's ankle with his left hand. He rammed his head upward, and with a yell, the thug was thrown more than 2 meters away, falling to the ground and screaming. Wei Xiu Lin then seized the gun and chased after his unit.

Wei Xiu Lin had fallen behind.

His left hand was clutching the newly acquired magazine, and his right hand was tightly gripping the gun he had picked up, tucked under his left armpit. At Chongwenmen East Street, his right arm had been struck by a flying stone and was no longer responsive. His legs, shoulders, and head had also been injured in three places. The box of ammunition was still on his shoulders, and he continued to advance step by step with great difficulty.

As he approached Chongwenmen, three thugs, seeing that Wei Xiu Lin was burdened and could not move easily, rushed over and surrounded him. "Kill him!" "Disarm him!" the thugs shouted viciously. Wei Xiu Lin was furious and wanted to take them down. But he thought, with a box of ammunition on him, he couldn't act recklessly. The thugs were shouting wildly and beating him. Wei Xiu Lin did not retaliate; instead, he lay down on the ground, considering his options. It seemed that he could only outsmart them, not fight them head-on. Wei Xiu Lin made up his mind, raised his left hand, and rolled to the right, performing several somersaults. In the dark, the thugs didn't see what Wei Xiu Lin was holding, nor did they understand the tactic of rolling sideways. They were taken aback and quickly dispersed.

Wei Xiu Lin cursed under his breath, "Idiots!" He took the opportunity to jump up and ran away.

    铁汉子
    谢玉久　缪青民
    提起首都戒严部队某部五连一班战士魏修林，人们都说他是：“顶着困难上，迎着危险行的硬汉子”。
    今年6月3日夜，向戒严区开进的队伍通过第一道障碍后，逐渐加快了速度。魏修林背着枪弹，和战友一起疾步行进。
    枪，魏修林的目光停留在左前方3米处的一支手枪上。他快走几步，俯身去拾，一名歹徒抢在他们前面，一脚把手枪踢到路边。说时迟，那时快，魏修林一个鱼跃扑过去，伸出左手去抢那支手枪。只差了几厘米，却一下搓在一块尖石上，扎进了手心。他忍着疼痛又伸出右手，闪电般地按住手枪。歹徒一抬脚正踩在魏修林的手背上，皮鞋底左右一碾，一阵钻心疼痛，小魏咬紧牙，死死抓住手枪不放。此刻，他只有一个念头，就是决不能让武器落入歹徒之手。
    魏修林憋足一口气，身子往前一收，左手突然抓住歹徒的脚脖子，头猛地往上一顶，只听得“哎哟”一声，歹徒被顶出两米多远，倒地乱叫，小魏便趁势抓起手枪，向队伍追去。
    魏修林掉队了。
    他的左手攥着刚拣到的弹匣，右手紧握着拾到的那支手枪，掖在左臂胳肢窝下。在崇文门东大街，他的右臂曾被飞石砸得不听使唤。腿上，肩部、头部也已3处负伤。那箱子弹仍然在他肩上背着，一步步艰难地行进。
    行至崇文门附近，3名歹徒欺魏修林重负在身，行走不便。便冲过去把他围住。“打死他。”“缴他的枪。”这伙歹徒恶狠狠地喊。小魏心里很气，真想收拾几个。但又一想，一箱子弹在身，不可贸然。歹徒一边狂叫，一边拳打脚踢，魏修林没有还手，就势卧倒在地，考虑对策。看来，只能智取，不可硬拚。魏修林打定主意，左手往上一扬，整个身子向右一转，接连几个滚翻。因天黑，歹徒们没看清魏修林手里拿着什么家伙，也不知侧滚翻是什么战术，怔了一怔，赶紧散开了。
    小魏暗暗地骂了一声：“笨蛋！”乘势跃起，飞奔而去。
