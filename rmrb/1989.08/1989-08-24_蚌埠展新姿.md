Bengbu, once a place piled with garbage, is now famous nationwide for its civilized city image. Here, wide and clean main streets, flat and tidy alleys, and street food vendors with sterilized utensils have left a deep and pleasant impression on travelers from all directions.

In urban construction, 96% of the 346 dirt roads in the city have been replaced with cement roads. All 269 public toilets have been renovated and repaired, and more than 20 parks and many street attractions provide places for citizens to rest and entertain. In the activity of creating a civilized city, Bengbu pays attention to combining urban management with educating people. In recent years, the city has taken various forms to educate officials and the masses on adhering to the four cardinal principles and the "four haves." The number of municipal civilized units has increased from 16 in 1985 to 107. In the two evaluations of civilized city creation among the eight cities in Anhui Province, Bengbu has won first place both times.

    蚌埠展新姿
    蚌埠，这个曾是个垃圾成堆的地方，如今以文明城市的崭新风貌闻名全国。这里，宽敞整洁的大街，平坦干净的小巷，餐具消毒的街头饮食群，给南来北往的游客留下了深刻而美好的印象。
    在城市建设中，全市346条泥土路面的大街小巷，有96％以上的路面被水泥路代替，269座公共厕所全面进行了改造和维修，20多座游园和许多沿街景点为市民提供了休息、娱乐的场所。蚌埠市在创建文明城市的活动中，注意把治城与育人结合起来。近几年来，这个市采取各种形式，对干部群众进行坚持四项基本原则的教育和“四有”教育，市级文明单位由1985年的16个上升到107个。在安徽省8市创建文明城市的两次评比中，蚌埠均获得第一名。（蒋克平　谢永祥）
