Chi Haotian today at the launch ceremony of "Contemporary Chinese Militia" said that we must comprehensively strengthen militia construction.

"Contemporary Chinese Militia," with a foreword by Marshal Xu Xiangqian, is one of the 18 volumes of the National Defense Military Series. It vividly showcases the glorious achievements and significant role of China's militia with substantial historical data and grand scale.

Chi Haotian said, we must further improve the system of integrating militia with reserve forces, comprehensively strengthen militia construction, especially focusing on the militia construction in large and medium-sized cities and border and coastal defense areas, and fully leverage the militia's role in building and defending the motherland.
