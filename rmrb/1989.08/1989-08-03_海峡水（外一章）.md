The Strait's water, shining brightly.
How many eyes are sparkling, watching you, watching me, watching today and tomorrow?
The Strait's water records the scenes of joy and sorrow played out on the waves, records the vibrant clothing, the beautiful faces, records the surging laughter, the silent sorrow. It shines with a rainbow of colors!

Take a sip, what does the Strait's water taste like? The burning thirst turns into a sweet quench, the lonely heart is intoxicated… Is it honey? Is it wine? Sweetness mixed with saltiness—how many tears have flowed into it?

Look, at night it roars and crashes against the shore! It endures the unbearable pain and torment!

Every day the sun boils it, and it rolls with waves of heat…

		Gazing Afar

The sea no longer weeps, it is calm and still.
Is it him again, coming to the shore to gaze afar?
The sea recognizes him—yes, it is him!
For many years, he has always come to the shore—
Facing the Strait, his eyes narrow into a slit, his gaze piercing through! The wind whips the waves, flags fluttering…

The rising sun appears in his gaze, then dies in those two tears that never fall;
The full moon hangs in his gaze, then melts into those two fathomless pools.

He often stands like this, standing as a lighthouse, to see the returning sails; he often crouches like this, crouching as a rock. The rock is eternal, his longing unyielding…

    海峡水（外一章）
    陈志泽
    海峡水，明晃晃地。
    有多少眼睛在闪闪烁烁，在看着你，看着我，看着今天和明朝？
    海峡水摄录下波涛之上一幕幕悲欢离合的搬演，摄录下鲜艳的服饰、美丽的容颜，摄录下奔涌的欢笑、静默的哀伤。它闪射着七彩之光！
    饮上一掬，海峡水呵是什么滋味？火烧火燎的焦渴变为清甜的滋润，寂寥的心醉了……它是蜜？它是酒？甜美中又带着咸涩——它汇进多少泪水？
    看吧，它暗夜里的惊涛裂岸！它忍受着难以忍受的痛苦的熬煎！
    每一天红日把它烧沸，它又是那样地热浪滚滚……
            遥望
    海不再恸哭了，一片宁静。
    又是他又来到海边遥望吗？
    海认得他——是的，是他！
    多少年了，他总是习惯到海边——
    朝着海峡，他的双眼眯成一条缝，那目光有无穷的穿透力！风拍打的龙潭，旗一样飘舞……
    旭日升起在他的凝眸，又在那两滴不会滴落的泪里熄灭了；
    明月悬挂在他的凝眸，又消融在那两泓深不可测的深潭里。
    他常这么站着，站成一座灯塔，要照见归帆；他常这么蹲着，蹲成一块岩石。岩石不朽，他的想望弥坚……
