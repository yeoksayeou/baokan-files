The farmers of Nanzhao County in Henan Province, who have suffered greatly from droughts, have carefully summarized the lessons of weak agricultural foundations and poor disaster resistance. They have voluntarily organized themselves to jointly purchase water conservancy machinery and dig wells together. At present, more than 500 farmland construction cooperatives have emerged throughout the county, increasing the effective irrigated area by 20,000 mu. The people say: "In the past, we spent money building houses, but now we pool resources to build water conservancy projects. Although it costs some money, the benefits are seen in the same year, and it is worth it!" This year, despite the drought, the county's wheat production has fully utilized the power of wells, with total production and yield per unit area increasing by 34.2% and 34.8% respectively compared to last year.

    南召组成五百多农田基建联合体
    本报讯　吃尽旱灾苦头的河南省南召县农民，认真总结农业基础脆弱、抗灾能力差的经验教训，自发组织起来联合购买水利机械、共同打井。目前，全县已涌现出500多个农田基本建设联合体，新增有效灌溉面积2万亩。群众说：“过去花钱盖房舍，如今集资办水利，虽说花点钱，当年就见效，值得！”今年全县小麦在遭受干旱的情况下，由于充分发挥了机井的威力，总产和单产分别比去年增加34.2％和34.8％。
