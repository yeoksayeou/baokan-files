According to statistics from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the number of individual industrial and commercial households in urban and rural areas across the country has been declining month by month in the first half of this year. By the end of June, the actual number of households had decreased by 2.184 million compared to the end of last year, and the number of people engaged in these businesses had decreased by 3.616 million, representing a decrease of 15% and 15.7%, respectively.

In terms of industries, the transportation sector saw the largest decline, with the number of households and individuals engaged in this sector decreasing by 26.3% and 28.3%, respectively, compared to the end of last year. The region with the largest decline was Shanxi, where the number of households and individuals engaged in these businesses decreased by 44.2% and 55.5%, respectively, compared to last year. Other provinces and autonomous regions with declines of more than 20% in the number of households and individuals engaged in these businesses include Qinghai, Hunan, Hubei, Ningxia, Gansu, Shandong, and Anhui.

According to an analysis, the main reasons for the decline in the number of individual households in the first half of the year are:

* Due to the tightening of credit, individual households have difficulty obtaining the loans they need;
* Some individual households face shortages and high prices of raw materials and fuels, making their production and business operations unprofitable;
* There are serious issues of arbitrary assessments and fees imposed on individual households from various quarters;
* Some individual households have poor management.

    贷款困难　原料紧缺　不堪摊派　经营不善
    城乡个体从业人员减少361万
    本报讯　据国家工商局统计，今年上半年，全国城乡个体工商户数逐月下降。6月底比去年底实际户数减少218.4万户，从业人员减少361.6万人，分别下降15％和15.7％。
    从行业看，下降幅度较大的是交通运输业，户数和从业人数比去年底分别下降26.3％和28.3％；下降幅度较大的地区是山西，户数和从业人数分别比去年下降44.2％、55.5％。户数和从业人数下降幅度在20％以上的有青海、湖南、湖北、宁夏、甘肃、山东、安徽等省区。
    据分析，上半年个体户数下降的主要原因是：
    由于紧缩银根，个体户所需贷款难以解决；
    一些个体户所需原材料、燃料货缺价高，生产经营无利可图；
    多方面向个体户乱摊派、乱收费现象较严重；
    一部分个体户经营管理不善。
