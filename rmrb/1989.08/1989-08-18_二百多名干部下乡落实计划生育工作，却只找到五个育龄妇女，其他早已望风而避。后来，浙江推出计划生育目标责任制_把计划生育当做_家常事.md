	The phrase "Industry is eagerly pursued, agriculture is reluctantly pursued, and family planning is not pursued at all" about the division of labor among grassroots officials has become less relevant since Zhejiang Province implemented the family planning target management responsibility system. The leadership of the Zhejiang Provincial Family Planning Commission told reporters: "Family planning work used to be something that many officials wanted to avoid, but now it has become a 'household matter' for officials and childbearing-age women at all levels."

	Zhejiang Province experienced a population increase in 1986 and 1987, and faced the challenge of the "dragon year" with "dragon children and dragon grandchildren." However, due to the implementation of the family planning target management responsibility system, the province had 50,000 fewer births in 1988 compared to the previous year, with a population growth rate below 9.6‰, the lowest in the country.

	The 11 prefecture-level cities in Zhejiang Province have included family planning in their performance evaluation, making it a part of their political achievements. 89 counties (districts) have signed target responsibility contracts with higher and lower-level departments. Most townships (towns) have signed responsibility letters with the next higher level. Some places have even signed birth, non-birth, and late birth contracts directly with childbearing-age women, ensuring that family planning work is implemented step by step.

	The leadership of the Zhejiang Provincial Family Planning Commission told reporters about an incident: In 1987, Huangyan County organized more than 200 people to go to Pingdian Township to check and implement family planning measures. After a whole day of work, they only found 5 family planning targets, and the whereabouts of dozens of other childbearing-age women were unknown. It turned out that before the inspection team left, a cadre from the township had leaked the news, and the childbearing-age women either returned to their maternal homes or visited relatives to avoid the inspection. After the county signed a target management responsibility contract with Pingdian Township last year, family planning became a "household matter" for township and village cadres. The cadres divided the work into sections and conducted household surveys, mobilizing and solving problems. The family planning compliance rate in this township increased from 58% to 96% within a year.

	Some places in Zhejiang Province have implemented target responsibility management to the grassroots level, signing contracts with childbearing-age couples, making family planning a "household matter" for the childbearing-age population. Since June last year, Huangyan County has fully implemented the practice of township (town) governments signing marriage and childbearing contracts with childbearing-age couples. According to the current birth policy and combined with local conditions, it is stipulated that rural "single daughter households" can have a second child after an interval of 5 years. "Single son households" are issued "no more children" notices. The contract clearly specifies the current birth policy, the rights and obligations of both parties, and the penalties for breach of contract, and is legally effective after being notarized. Last year, the county signed and notarized more than 10,000 family planning contracts, accounting for 94% of the number to be signed, and issued more than 20,000 "no more children" notices, accounting for 96% of the number to be issued. Huangyan County's implementation to individuals and through contract notarization has strengthened the public's awareness of birth policies and played a significant role in reducing the phenomenon of rushing to give birth and escaping birth.

	Zhejiang Province's implementation of the family planning target management responsibility system is not only aimed at family planning departments and county, township, and village cadres, but also extends to various relevant departments. In the water network-dense rice and fish country of Huzhou, the birth issue of boat captains who drive boats for transportation has always been a difficult point in family planning work. Nowadays, there are more individual household operators engaged in transportation, and "husband and wife boats" sail here today and there tomorrow. Even if they are pregnant, where can you find them? The comrades from the Agricultural Machinery Water Conservancy Bureau knew about this and took the opportunity of the boat captains' annual verification at the agricultural machinery supervision station to take on the responsibility of supervision. In Pucun Township, there is a transportation household whose wife is pregnant out of plan. Several times of persuasion to have an operation failed. The agricultural supervision station temporarily detained his navigation certificate and said to him: "Detaining the certificate is not our local policy. The Constitution of the country and the local regulations of the province require citizens to adhere to family planning. If you violate the national policy, we will certainly manage it." This supervision is indeed effective. In the afternoon of the same day, this transportation household sent his wife for the operation.

	Since various departments in charge have also implemented family planning target management, they no longer pass the buck on this number one difficult problem of family planning.

	"Family planning policies are not strict, but it is feared that you will not handle matters fairly." This is the feedback heard by grassroots family planning cadres. The family planning department of Zhejiang Province attaches great importance to this issue. In Huangyan County, more than 40 in-service personnel who violated family planning have been demoted from their positions. All party members have received party disciplinary actions ranging from warnings to expulsion from the party. In terms of administration, in addition to paying the over-quota childbirth fee in full, they cannot be promoted, cannot be promoted in rank, and cannot be promoted for five years. The public praises this as "taking it seriously."

### 二百多名干部下乡落实计划生育工作，却只找到五个育龄妇女，其他早已望风而避。后来，浙江推出计划生育目标责任制——把计划生育当做“家常事”

    二百多名干部下乡落实计划生育工作，却只找到五个育龄妇女，其他早已望风而避。后来，浙江推出计划生育目标责任制——
    把计划生育当做“家常事”
    新华社记者　朱国贤　何玲玲
    “工业抢着抓，农业勉强抓，计划生育不想抓”，这句关于基层干部分工的顺口溜，在浙江实行计划生育目标管理责任制后溜不顺了。浙江省计生委的领导告诉记者：“计划生育工作以前是许多干部都想避开的事，如今成了各级干部和育龄妇女的‘家常事’了。”
    浙江省1986年、1987年连续两年人口回升，步入龙年后面临“龙年生龙子龙女”的冲击。然而，由于推行了计划生育目标管理责任制，全省1988年比上一年少生5万多人，人口自增率在9.6‰以下，为全国最低。
    浙江省11个地市把计划生育列为考核项目，作为考察政绩的内容。89个县（区）与上下级部门签订了目标责任制，绝大部分乡（镇）向上一级签了责任书。有的地方还与育龄妇女直接签订生育、不育、晚育合同，使计划生育工作步步到位。
    浙江省计生委领导向记者讲了这样一件事：黄岩县1987年组织200来人进山到平田乡检查落实计划生育措施，忙乎了一整天，只找到5个计划生育对象，另外几十名育龄妇女不知去向。原来检查人员还没出发，该乡的一位干部透露了风声，育龄妇女或回娘家，或走亲戚避开了。去年县里同平田乡签定目标管理责任书后，计划生育成了乡村干部的“家常事”。乡村干部分片包干，挨家挨户摸底，动员、解决问题。这个乡的计划生育符合率一年里从58％跳到了96％。
    浙江省一些地方把目标责任管理落实到底，与育龄夫妇签定合同，使计划生育也成了育龄人群的“家常事”。黄岩县从去年6月起全面推行乡（镇）政府与育龄夫妇签订婚育合同，根据现行生育政策，结合当地实际，规定农村“独女户”间隔5年准生第二胎。对“独男户”发放不再生育通知书。合同书具体明确了现行生育政策，规定了合同双方的权利和义务，以及违约处罚条例，并经司法公证生效。去年，全县共签订并公证了计划生育合同书一万多份，占应签数的94％，发放“不再生育通知书”两万多份，占应发数的96％。黄岩县落实到人并通过合同公证，增强了群众的生育政策观念，对减少抢生、逃生现象起了较大的促进作用。
    浙江省推行计划生育目标责任管理，不仅仅针对计划生育部门和县、乡、村干部，而且扩大到了各个有关的部门。水网密布的鱼米之乡湖州，驾船跑运输的船老大的生育问题，历来都是计划生育工作的难点。如今从事运输的个体户多了，“夫妻船”今天开到这里，明天驶到那里，即使怀孕了，你上哪儿找她？农机水利局的同志知道后，利用船老大的每年都要到农机监管站验证的机会，承担起督促责任。苕南乡有个运输户的妻子超计划怀孕，几次动员她去做手术，都没成功。农监站暂时扣了他的航运证，对他说：“扣证不是我们的土政策，国家宪法和省地方法规要求公民必须坚持计划生育，违犯了国策，我们当然要管。”这项监督果然灵，当天下午，这个运输户就送妻子做了手术。
    由于各主管部门也实行了计划生育目标管理，对计划生育这个头号难题也不再踢皮球了。
    “不怕计划生育政策严，只怕你办事不公。”这是基层计划生育干部听到的反映。浙江省计生部门很重视这个问题。黄岩县违反计划生育的40多名在职人员，有职务的一律撤职，凡是党员都受到从警告到开除党籍的党纪处分，行政上除如数交纳超生子女费外，五年内不能调资、不能晋级、不能提拔，群众称赞这是“动真格的”。
