East German female swimmers once again left other competitors envious, securing all three gold medals available on the fifth day of the 19th European Swimming Championships. As a result, the gold medal count for East German female swimmers stands at 8, while other European competitors have yet to secure any.

In the women's 400-meter freestyle final, East Germany's Merlin added another gold to her tally, setting a new European record of 4 minutes 5.84 seconds, breaking the previous record of 4 minutes 5.94 seconds. East Germany's renowned swimmer Friedrich, who has been in poor form recently, had to settle for the silver medal.

The world's top female swimmer, the six-time gold medalist from the Seoul Olympics, East Germany's Kristin Otto, made her appearance in the women's 100-meter backstroke final. Naturally, the gold medal was hers. Hungary's 15-year-old rising star, Egerszegi, put up a valiant effort but fell short, finishing 0.58 seconds behind Otto's winning time of 1 minute 1.86 seconds. Another 17-year-old East German swimmer, Eichhorst, secured the bronze medal. West German swimming star Gross, who was commentating for television, praised Eichhorst as Otto's ideal successor.

In the women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay final, which featured teams from eight countries, East Germany took the gold, the Netherlands the silver, and West Germany the bronze.

Today's men's events included the finals for the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter backstroke. In the men's 100-meter freestyle final, Italy's Giorgio Lamberti, who had just broken the world record in the 200-meter freestyle two days prior, not only won the gold medal but also set a new European record of 49.24 seconds, shaving 0.11 seconds off the previous record. Battistelli claimed the gold in the men's 200-meter backstroke with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. The gold medal in the men's 1-meter springboard diving final went to the Netherlands' Janse.

    第19届欧洲游泳锦标赛上
    民主德国游泳女将再次包揽金牌
    新华社波恩8月17日电（记者戴履斌）民主德国游泳女将再次使别国选手望金牌而兴叹，今天在第19届欧洲游泳锦标赛第五天的比赛中，又把为数不多的3块金牌悉数揽入怀中。至此，民主德国游泳女选手与其他欧洲选手的金牌之比为8∶0。
    在女子400米自由泳决赛中，民主德国的默林锦上添花，以4分5秒84的成绩刷新了这个项目4分5秒94的欧洲纪录。名噪一时的民主德国名将弗里德里希近况不佳，只获得银牌。
    世界女子泳坛头号名将、汉城奥运会6枚金牌获得者、民主德国的奥托今天在女子100米仰泳决赛中亮相，自然金牌非她莫属。匈牙利15岁小将艾盖尔斯泽吉奋力向名将冲击，但火候未到，最后比奥托1分1秒86的冠军成绩慢了0.58秒，获得亚军。另一个17岁的民主德国选手艾希霍尔斯特虽只获得铜牌，但担任电视报道员的西德游泳名将格罗斯则称艾希霍尔斯特是奥托的理想接班人。
    在有8个国家参加的女子4×100米自由泳接力决赛中，民主德国队获金牌、荷兰队获银牌，西德队获铜牌。
    今天男子项目进行了100米自由泳和200米仰泳的决赛。在男子100米自由泳决赛中，前天刚刚打破200米自由泳世界纪录的意大利选手乔治·贝兰蒂不仅胸前挂上了金牌，而且还以49秒24的成绩把这个项目的欧洲纪录缩短了0.11秒。巴蒂斯泰利以1分59秒96的成绩捧走男子200米仰泳金牌。男子一米跳板跳水的决赛，金牌被荷兰选手永海扬斯获得。
