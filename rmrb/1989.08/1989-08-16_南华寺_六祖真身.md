The Nanhu Temple, located 22 kilometers southeast of Shaoguan city, is renowned for its spiritual aura, despite not being the largest temple. The temple's fame lies in its enduring reputation over thousands of years and the preservation of the true body of Hui Neng, the Sixth Patriarch of the Tang Dynasty's Zen Buddhism.

The term "true body" refers to the mummified remains of Hui Neng. Despite the passage of over 1,200 years, this mummy remains remarkably well-preserved. In 1981, after the true body of the Sixth Patriarch was elevated and consecrated, visitors were able to see his likeness: dressed in a red robe, he sits upright with eyes half-closed, exuding a serene and dignified presence. His face is benevolent, and a slight smile graces his lips, as if he is imparting the "Zen teachings of the Southern School" to his disciples.

This revered monk, who lived to the age of 76, is beloved by his disciples for his reforms in Buddhism. The founding patriarch, Bodhidharma, taught the Zen teachings of the Buddha, emphasizing the recitation of scriptures and lifelong cultivation, known as the "Gradual Method." In contrast, Hui Neng preached at Nanhu Temple, advocating sudden enlightenment. His followers did not need to adhere to numerous Buddhist precepts; instead, they believed that enlightenment could be achieved instantly. This simple path to enlightenment quickly gained popularity nationwide, known as the "Sudden Method" of Zen Buddhism, and became a distinctly Chinese form of Buddhism. Nanhu Temple is thus known as the "Ancestral Temple," and Hui Neng is revered as the "Sixth Patriarch of Zen."

According to historical records, in the second year of the Xiantian era of the Tang Dynasty (713 AD), on the third day of the eighth lunar month, the Sixth Patriarch passed away at Guo'en Temple in Xinxiang County, Guangdong. The following year, his true body and the robe he received were moved back to Nanhu Temple, where he has since been the permanent resident "Great Mirror Zen Master," receiving absolute and unwavering protection from his disciples. Throughout the centuries, regardless of natural disasters or human calamities, the true body of the Sixth Patriarch has remained unscathed, much like the ancient cypress trees in the temple. During the tumultuous decade of the Cultural Revolution, the monks braved the dangers together, sharing both honor and disgrace, and remained with the true body of the Sixth Patriarch day and night, ultimately preserving it from the destructive purge.

Comparing this to the underground palace of Famen Temple in Fufeng County, Shaanxi, where four rare finger bones of the Buddha were unearthed, the contrast reveals a secret: Buddhist disciples have established a credible image and a strong spiritual pillar, which has enabled Buddhism to flourish.

As materialists, we do not believe in Buddhism, but we can learn from the Buddhist spirit. For a period, there has been a tendency to disregard our own cultural heritage, viewing our ancestors' precious legacies as worthless. In the end, history is left barren, and the land is left desolate.

Today, the Sixth Patriarch Hall at Nanhu Temple is bustling with visitors. Buddhist groups from Japan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and other countries have come to witness the "Second Great Miracle of World Buddhism." Despite differences in skin color, race, and language, their admiration is the same. Some express astonishment: Buddhism originated in ancient India, so why are the Buddhist relics found in China?

This reflects a side of our country's religious beliefs and cultural heritage protection.

### 南华寺“六祖真身”

    南华寺“六祖真身”
    蔡常维
    韶关市区东南22公里的曹溪边，有一座“寺不在大，有佛则灵”的南华寺。说寺灵，指的是此寺名扬海内外，历几千年不衰；说有佛，是指寺中至今还完好保存着唐代佛教禅宗——六祖惠能真身。
    这“真身”说得通俗一点，它就是六祖惠能自身的僵尸。月换星移，时光如梭，1200多年过去了，这具僵尸却依然栩栩如生。1981年，南华寺六祖真身升座开光后，游人得以看清他的尊容：他身披红色袈裟，正襟危坐，双目微闭，泰然自若，脸孔慈祥，嘴角挂着一丝微笑，似乎正在给佛门弟子传授“南宗禅法”。
    这位活了76岁的佛教界的高僧，是因为改革佛教而受其弟子爱戴的。始祖达摩和尚传授佛祖释迦牟尼禅教，主张背诵经卷和累世修行，称为“渐法”。而慧能和尚在南华寺开坛说法，主张顿然觉悟，信奉者不必遵守繁多的佛戒，只要一旦幡然，即可成佛。这种简单的成佛办法一经提出，立即风靡全国，称为禅宗“顿法”，成为中国式的佛教。南华寺因此被称为“祖庭”，慧能也获“禅宗六祖”称号。
    据史书记载，唐玄宗先天二年（公元713年）八月初三，六祖圆寂于广东新兴县国恩寺，次年迁真身并所传衣钵回南华寺，此后便一直成为“祖庭”常驻的正统“大鉴禅师”，受到本家弟子绝对的、舍命的保护。千百年来，不管本寺发生什么天灾的劫难，或是人祸的践踏，六祖真身就像寺中的千年古杉，安然无恙。十年动乱期间，众僧风险共担，荣辱与共，日夜与六祖真身同在，终于躲过了这场破坏性的大洗劫。
    联想到陕西扶风县法门寺的地宫，那里曾出土了举世罕见的释迦牟尼四枚佛指舍利。南北“二宝”相对照，从中看出了一点奥秘：佛门弟子们竖起一个可信的形象，建立强大的精神支柱，才使得佛法弘扬。
    我们唯物论者不信佛，但佛门精神却不妨借鉴。一个时期以来，对于自己过去的文明不屑一顾，把自己祖先的珍贵遗产看作一堆烂污，最后只剩下历史一片空荡荡，大地一片白茫茫……
    今天，南华寺六祖殿中游人若织。来自日本、泰国、斯里兰卡、新加坡等国的佛教团体都赶来争睹“世界佛教第二奇迹”。虽然肤色不同、种族不同、语言不同，赞叹却是相同的。有的赞中带诧：佛教起源于古印度，缘何佛宝尽出在中国？
    它映照出我们国家的宗教信仰和文物保护的一个侧面。
