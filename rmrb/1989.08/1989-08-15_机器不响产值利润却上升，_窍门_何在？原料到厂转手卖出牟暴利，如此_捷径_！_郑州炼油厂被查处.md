Over the past two years, people in the Zhengzhou Refining Plant have not heard the roar of machinery, and the workshops are devoid of working personnel. However, this plant's output and profits have been increasing year by year. Recently, the Zhengzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's Supervision and Inspection Team, after more than half a year of effort, uncovered the fact that the Zhengzhou Refining Plant had resorted to unscrupulous methods, illegally selling large quantities of state-planned raw materials to make huge profits.

The Zhengzhou Refining Plant is a state-owned enterprise with over 200 employees. The state allocates 400 tons of planned raw materials, such as soap wax, to this plant annually, and also issues production plans for products like Vaseline and lubricating grease. In recent years, the supply of raw materials has become increasingly tight. The leaders who contracted the Zhengzhou Refining Plant discovered a "shortcut": processing soap wax for production was not as profitable or convenient as directly selling it. According to the investigation by the industry and commerce department, this plant purchased 785 tons of soap wax at 340 yuan per ton in 1987 and 1988. Apart from a small portion used to produce oxidized wax and self-reported losses, the remaining 712.5 tons were sold without any processing, at prices ranging from 1,000 yuan to 2,500 yuan per ton, to nearly 40 units including local material supply departments and township enterprises, illegally gaining 1.079 million yuan.

To evade inspections by the industry and commerce and higher-level departments, the plant adopted very covert methods to conceal its illegal activities: while directly selling soap wax, it also issued product invoices from the sales department, had the production workshop withdraw raw materials from the raw material warehouse, entered finished products into the warehouse, had the production department statistics production volume and value, and had the finance department record product sales. With the "money-making" method of selling raw materials, the production of the Zhengzhou Refining Plant was basically in a state of paralysis.

The case is currently being handled.

    机器不响产值利润却上升，“窍门”何在？
    原料到厂转手卖出牟暴利，如此“捷径”！
    郑州炼油厂被查处
    本报郑州8月15日电　这两年，人们在郑州炼油厂厂区内听不到机器的轰鸣声，车间里看不到劳动的工人，可这个厂的产值利润却年年上升。最近，郑州市工商局经检大队经过半年多的努力，查清了郑州炼油厂不择手段，将国家计划分配的原材料大量倒卖、牟取暴利的事实。
    郑州炼油厂是有200多名职工的全民企业。国家每年分配给这个厂计划内原料皂腊指标400吨，并下达有凡士林、润滑脂的生产计划。近年来，原材料供应日益紧张，承包郑州炼油厂的厂领导发现了一条“捷径”：用皂腊进行加工生产，不如直接倒卖能赚钱、省事。据工商部门的调查，这个厂1987、1988两年，以每吨340元的价格购进皂腊785吨，除了小部分用于生产氧化石腊和自报损耗外，其余712.5吨未经任何加工，便以每吨1000元至2500元的价格转手出售给地方物资部门、乡镇企业等近40个单位，非法获利107.9万元。
    为了逃避工商和上级部门的检查，这个厂采取了十分隐蔽的手段掩盖其非法行为：一面直接出售皂腊，一面却有从销售科开出产品发票、生产车间从原料库领取原料、成品入库、生产科统计产量产值、财务科将产品销售入帐的整套手续。有了倒卖原材料这条“生财之道”，郑州炼油厂的生产基本处于瘫痪状态。
    目前，此案正在处理中。　（李而亮　辛秦昌）
