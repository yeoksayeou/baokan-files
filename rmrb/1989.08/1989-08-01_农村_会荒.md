Title: The Plight of "Meeting Scarcity" in Rural Areas

A farmer who is a member of the Communist Party humorously remarked: City dwellers fear being drowned in a "sea of meetings," but in our rural areas, we are experiencing a "meeting scarcity." This means that there are too few meetings in rural areas.

The proliferation of documents and meetings, of course, needs to be addressed. However, in rural areas, not holding necessary meetings also has its drawbacks. For example, the "three meetings" of the party branch, such as the party branch member meeting, are stipulated to be held once every quarter, but currently, many branches do not hold a meeting even once every half year or even once a year. Party small group meetings, youth league branch meetings, and village meetings are even rarer.

The author does not advocate for a "sea of meetings" in rural areas, but not holding necessary meetings and not discussing important issues can also harm rural work. For instance, the spirit of important party meetings, relevant documents on rural work, and instructions and resolutions that should be conveyed to the grassroots masses often get stalled at the level of township and village cadres. If these are not conveyed to the farmers and if party members are not organized to study and discuss them, how can the policies and laws of the party and the state regarding rural areas be effectively implemented? Currently, in some places, rural problems are relatively numerous, which is related to the fact that necessary meetings are rarely held.

As far as I know, rural party members and the masses are not generally opposed to holding meetings. For meetings that speak the truth, are closely related to the interests of farmers, and help farmers solve problems and doubts, not only will the masses not be resentful, but they will also be very welcome. Moreover, holding meetings in rural areas does not involve the extravagance of materials.

### 农村“会荒”

    农村“会荒”
    许士光
    一位农民党员风趣地说：城里人害怕被“会海”淹死，我们农村里却在闹“会荒”。意思是农村会议太少了。
    “文山”日高，“会海”日深，当然要平“山”填“海”。但在农村该开的会不开也有弊端。如党组织“三会”中的支部党员大会，还规定每季度召开一次，但眼下不少支部半年乃至一年也不召开一次；党小组会、团支部会、村民大会等，更是难得开了。
    笔者并不企望“会海”在农村泛滥，但该开的会不开，该讲的话不讲，同样有损农村工作。比如，党的重要会议精神，有关农村工作的文件，应该传达到基层群众的指示、决议等，到了乡村干部那里就搁浅了。不向农民传达，不组织党员学习讨论，党和国家有关农村的政策、法令怎能得到很好的贯彻呢？当前有些地方农村问题较多，同必要的会很少开有一定关系。
    据我所知，农村党员和群众并不是一概反对开会，对于那些讲真话的会，与农民利益息息相关的会，为农民解难释疑的会，不仅不会为群众反感，而且会大受欢迎。更何况，农村开会没有财物铺张之忧呢？
