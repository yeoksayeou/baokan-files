	Alphai Emphasizes in the Second Session of the Fifth Tibetan People's Congress that Tibet Has a Future Only by Following the Socialist Path
	The Door for Negotiations Between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama Remains Open

	Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 31st - Reporter Liu Wei reports: Alphai Alphai Qinjie, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan People's Congress, today at the fourth plenary session of the second meeting of the Fifth Tibetan People's Congress, made a lengthy speech on the Lhasa riots, Tibet's historical issues, and the current work in Tibet. He summarized: The nearly 40 years since Tibet's peaceful liberation have proven that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the Tibetan people be masters of their own house and live a happy life; only by following the socialist path does Tibet have a bright future.

	When talking about the Lhasa riots, Vice Chairman Alphai Alphai Qinjie said, as early as the beginning of this century, some people, under the instigation of imperialist forces, took advantage of China's turbulent situation to shout "Tibet independence." After Tibet's peaceful liberation, although the separatist forces within the region have been restrained, the separatist elements abroad have never stopped their activities to split the motherland. The more than ten riots that have occurred in Lhasa since 1987 are all organized, planned, and purposeful actions by a small number of separatist elements abroad, with the support and instigation of certain hostile forces.

	When talking about Tibet's history, Vice Chairman Alphai Alphai Qinjie said, Tibet was incorporated into the territory of China during the Yuan Dynasty, which is recorded and explained in both Han and Tibetan historical documents and is an undeniable historical fact. Of course, Tibet has its unique characteristics different from other ethnic minorities in China. This is not only reflected in its high altitude and lack of oxygen, the fact that more than 90% of the population is religious, and its own script, culture, and customs, but more importantly, the Tibetan local government had a high degree of autonomy under the rule of the central governments of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Since Tibet's peaceful liberation, except for the 10 years of the Cultural Revolution, the Party's policies and guidelines for Tibet in various periods have been basically correct, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party has formulated a series of policies that suit Tibet's reality. At the second session of the Sixth National People's Congress, the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" was also passed, which has been supported by the Tibetan people and people of all ethnicities. Although the Party's central leadership has undergone many changes in recent years, the Party's policies and guidelines for Tibet have remained unchanged, and now new policies that better suit Tibet's reality and reflect the characteristics of regional ethnic autonomy are being studied and formulated.

	Another report: Vice Chairman Alphai Alphai Qinjie of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said in Lhasa today: To meet the wishes of the Tibetan people to believe, the Dalai Lama's only choice is to sincerely negotiate with the central government. A small number of separatist elements, whether in Lhasa or elsewhere, advocating "Tibet independence" and creating disturbances, will have no way out.

	Vice Chairman Alphai said that he had served for nearly eight years as a Kalon under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and has deep feelings for the Dalai Lama, respecting the Dalai Lama. He hopes that the Dalai Lama will maintain a good relationship with the central government. Vice Chairman Alphai said that the central government's door for negotiations with the Dalai Lama remains open. As long as the Dalai Lama abandons the stance of "Tibet independence," the central government can negotiate on any condition. The central government has never recognized the Tibetan government-in-exile abroad, and the central government only negotiates with the Dalai Lama himself or his personal representatives.

    阿沛在西藏五届人大二次会上强调
    西藏走社会主义道路才有前途
    中央和达赖谈判的大门始终敞开
    本报拉萨7月31日电　记者刘伟报道：全国人大常委会副委员长、西藏人大常委会主任阿沛·阿旺晋美今天在西藏五届人大二次会议第4次大会上，就拉萨骚乱、西藏历史问题和西藏当前的工作作了长篇发言。他总结说：西藏和平解放近40年来的事实证明，只有共产党的领导，西藏人民才能当家做主，过上幸福生活；只有走社会主义道路，西藏才有光明前途。
    谈到拉萨骚乱时，阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长说，早在本世纪初，就有人在帝国主义势力唆使下，利用中国局势的动荡，叫嚷“西藏独立”。西藏和平解放后，境内的分裂势力虽有收敛，国外分裂分子始终没停止其分裂祖国的活动。1987年至今在拉萨发生的十几起骚乱，就是国外少数分裂分子在某些敌对势力支持和挑动下，有组织、有计划、有目的的分裂祖国活动。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长在谈到西藏历史时说，西藏在元朝归入中国版图，这在汉史和藏文史籍中都有记载和阐述，是不可否认的历史事实。当然，西藏有不同于中国其它少数民族的特殊性，这不仅表现在高寒缺氧、90％以上群众信教、有自己的文字、文化和习俗，更重要的一点是，西藏地方政府在元、明、清中央政权统治下有高度的自治权。西藏和平解放以来，除去“文革”10年，党在各个不同时期对西藏制定的方针、政策基本上是正确的，尤其十一届三中全会以来，党制定了一系列符合西藏实际的好政策，在六届二次全国人代会上还通过了《民族区域自治法》，受到藏族人民在内的各族人民的拥护。尽管这几年党中央领导机构多次变化，但党对西藏的方针、政策始终没有变，而且现在正在研究制定更能符合西藏实际、体现民族区域自治特点的新政策。
    又讯　全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美今天在拉萨说：为了满足藏族人民信仰的愿望，达赖喇嘛唯一的选择是和中央真诚谈判。少数分裂分子不管在拉萨或其他什么地方，鼓吹“西藏独立”，制造骚乱，都不会有出路。
    阿沛副委员长说，他曾在达赖喇嘛领导下担任过近8年的噶伦，对达赖喇嘛很有感情，尊敬达赖喇嘛，他希望达赖喇嘛与中央保持良好关系。阿沛副委员长说，中央对达赖喇嘛谈判的大门始终敞开，只要达赖喇嘛放弃“西藏独立”的立场，任何条件中央都可以谈判。中央从来没承认过流亡在国外的西藏噶厦政府，中央仅是和达赖喇嘛本人或他的私人代表谈判。
