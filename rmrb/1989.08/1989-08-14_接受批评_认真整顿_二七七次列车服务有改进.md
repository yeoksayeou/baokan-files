The 277/278 train, which was involved in a scandal where conductors, attendants, and thieves colluded to steal and divide a passenger's 100,000 yuan, has learned from its mistakes and undergone a thorough rectification, resulting in a noticeable improvement in service.

This direct express train, running between Taiyuan and Qingdao (Sifang), caused a major scandal throughout the railway system. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau Party Committee took this incident very seriously. The train crew underwent a phased reorganization of their thoughts, organization, and discipline. The leadership team of the train crew was adjusted, regulations were strengthened, and reliable and dedicated individuals were assigned to various service teams to serve as backbone members. This train has a long operating time, severe overcrowding, and poor vehicle conditions. After the rectification, the crew members exhibited a spirit of hard work and self-sacrifice, enduring more hardship and sweat to meet the passengers' demands as much as possible. On July 26, the attendant Zhang Ming in the sleeper car found a package on the floor containing 700 yuan, which belonged to passengers Mr. and Mrs. Yan Xiuzhen from Qingdao Textile Mill No. 1. The package was immediately returned. The couple, moved by the gesture, insisted on giving 100 yuan as a reward, but the attendant and the train conductor politely declined. Seeing this, the passengers exclaimed, "The spirit of Lei Feng has returned to the train!"

According to preliminary statistics, from mid-April to the end of July, the 277/278 train performed 8,754 good deeds for passengers and received 8,276 letters and comments of praise from passengers.

    接受批评  认真整顿
    二七七次列车服务有改进
    本报太原8月14日电　曾发生乘警、列车员和小偷相互勾结盗窃瓜分乘客万元巨款的277／278次列车，接受教训，认真整顿，服务态度明显改观。
    这趟由太原至青岛（四方）间的直快客车，发生震动全路的丑闻后，引起太原铁路分局党委的高度重视。车队对乘务员进行分期分批思想、组织、纪律整顿，调整了车队的领导班子，健全规章制度，抽调思想好、作风硬的同志充实各乘务组，并担任骨干。这趟列车运行时间长，超员严重，车况设备差，整顿后乘务员发扬艰苦奋斗精神，宁肯自己多受苦，多流汗，也尽量满足乘客要求。7月26日，卧铺车厢乘务员张茗发现地下掉一纸包，打开一看，内装人民币700元，是乘客青岛市国棉一厂颜秀珍夫妇丢失的，当即归还。老两口感动地拿100元钱硬要酬谢列车员，被列车员和车长婉言谢绝。乘客们见此情景说：“雷锋精神又回到车上了！”
    据初步统计，从4月中旬到7月底，277／278次列车为旅客办好事8754件，收到旅客表扬意见及信件8276件（条）。
