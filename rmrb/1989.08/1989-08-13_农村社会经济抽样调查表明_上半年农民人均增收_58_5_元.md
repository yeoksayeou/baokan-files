According to the rural socio-economic sampling survey team's survey of 66,600 rural households in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, farmers' per capita cash income (excluding savings and loan cash income) in the first half of 1989 was 291.4 yuan, an increase of 58.5 yuan compared to the same period last year. Without deducting the factor of price increases, the growth rate was 25.1%.

In the first half of the year, farmers' per capita cash income from selling products was 153.6 yuan, an increase of 31.2 yuan compared to the same period last year, with a relatively rapid growth rate. Among these, the per capita income from selling agricultural products was 60.1 yuan, and the per capita income from selling livestock products was 70.6 yuan. Cash income from township and village enterprises saw a significant increase, with a per capita income of 22.4 yuan. Farmers' cash income from engaging in family-operated secondary and tertiary industries continued to increase. In the first half of the year, farmers' per capita cash income from industries such as industrial processing, construction, transportation, productive services, commerce, catering, and services was 64.4 yuan, an increase of 14.6 yuan compared to the same period last year.

The survey indicates that there are significant differences in income among different types of rural areas. In the first half of the year, the per capita cash income in Guangdong, Shanghai, and Zhejiang, which were above 500 yuan, increased by 181.4 yuan, 176 yuan, and 112.4 yuan respectively. The per capita cash income in Jiangsu and Fujian provinces, which were between 400 and 500 yuan, increased by 92.9 yuan and 96.7 yuan respectively. The per capita income in Gansu and Tibet, which had the lowest income, did not exceed 20 yuan. The disparity between the highest and lowest incomes is quite significant.
