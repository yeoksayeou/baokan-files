Over the past week, the hostage crisis has gripped the entire United States. The government has been busy, the public is agitated, and television and newspapers are filled with discussions. Although the situation has somewhat eased, the crisis is far from over.

On July 28, Israel kidnapped a leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah, Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, which led to the killing of U.S. Marine Corps Colonel William Higgins. Another American hostage, the chief accountant of the American University of Beirut, Thomas Sutherland, also faces the threat of being killed. This has caused a strong reaction in Washington. The White House has held cabinet meetings to study the situation and plan countermeasures. Staff members have proposed numerous options, but there is limited room for maneuver. Over the past few days, the U.S. government has largely adopted a strategy of "implicit threat and persuasion." On the one hand, it has conducted diplomatic activities through various channels to save the hostages' lives. On the other hand, it has quietly mobilized warships to gather near the waters of Lebanon and Iran, ready for any eventuality. Unlike previous administrations, the Bush administration has been cautious and restrained in its statements to avoid escalating the situation. Even when the Israeli commandos carried out the kidnapping, Bush had said he did not support the kidnapping, stating that kidnapping and violence do not help the cause of peace in the Middle East. When the American hostages met with misfortune, the official statement was carefully worded, appealing to "all parties holding hostages in the Middle East to release the current hostages." The U.S. government's intention is to, through various efforts, ensure that American hostages do not suffer further harm and, if possible, secure their release, thereby ending the entire hostage incident.

However, in Congress, various condemnations have echoed through the halls. Some blame the Lebanese Shiite organizations, demanding that the government not show weakness to terrorism; others blame Israel for acting unilaterally for its own interests, provoking the incident and endangering American hostages. The general public is concerned about the fate of the American hostages and demands that the government do everything possible to ensure their safety.

In recent days, the U.S. diplomatic efforts to rescue the hostages have made some progress, and relevant parties have shown signs of flexibility, but there is still a considerable distance to go before the hostage crisis is resolved. First, the new Iranian President Rafsanjani's remarks about assisting the United States in resolving the hostage problem have attracted the attention of the U.S. government. Secondly, the Lebanese Shiite organizations and the Israeli authorities have changed their previous hardline stance and begun openly discussing how to conduct hostage exchanges, thereby easing the crisis and giving the United States more opportunities to conduct diplomatic activities. However, from the statements of either side, it is still not possible to quickly resolve the hostage problem. Some U.S. experts familiar with Middle Eastern issues believe that due to the complex background of the hostage problem and the many factors constraining each side, the hostage exchange will be a "lengthy process."

So far, Israel's stance and the stance of the Lebanese Shiite organizations are far apart. Israel insists that in the exchange, Israeli soldiers must be released first. It claims that only under the condition of releasing Israeli soldiers can Obeid be exchanged for Western hostages; otherwise, there can be no talk of any exchange. The Shiite organizations, on the other hand, demand that Israel release Obeid first before further discussions on exchanging hostages and prisoners of war. Therefore, around the hostage exchange, bargaining will be very difficult.

From the U.S. perspective, although the U.S. government has not formally changed its policy of not negotiating with hostage-takers, it has adopted a more flexible attitude and does not oppose Israel conducting the exchange. It hopes that all parties will release the hostages and that there will be no more kidnappings in the future. In the coming period, it will continue to urge the relevant parties to take actions favorable to the release of American hostages through direct and indirect channels, thereby escaping the hostage crisis. As for military action, U.S. leaders have not completely ruled it out, but they also acknowledge that this is not the ideal choice. Therefore, unless unexpected situations arise, the United States seems unlikely to act rashly.

### 困扰美国的人质危机

    困扰美国的人质危机
    本报记者　张启昕
    近一周来，人质危机牵动了整个美国，政府忙碌不迭，公众情绪沸扬，电视报刊议论纷纭。虽然目前事态有所缓和，但危机远未过去。
    以色列7月28日劫持黎巴嫩真主党的一名领导人奥贝德，致使造成美国海军陆战队中校希金斯被杀事件，而另一名美国人质——贝鲁特“美国大学”主计员西西皮奥，也面临遭杀害的威胁。这就如一石激起千层浪，在华盛顿引起强烈反响。白宫连日召开内阁要员会议，研究事态，筹划对策。幕僚们提出了众多的选择方案，但周旋的余地有限。几天来，美国政府采取的大体上是“潜在威胁与劝说”相结合的做法，一方面通过多种渠道开展外交活动，挽救人质生命，另一方面不加宣扬地调动军舰，集结于黎巴嫩、伊朗附近海域待命，以备万一。与过去几届政府不同，布什政府的言论一直谨慎含蓄，以求避免事态扩大。早在以色列突击队采取劫持行动时，布什就曾说过，他不赞成劫持行动，声称绑架和暴力无助于中东和平事业。在美国人质遭受不幸时，官方发表的声明也是经过反复推敲，呼吁“中东扣有人质的所有各方释放现有人质”。美国政府的意图是，通过各种努力，使美国人质不再受害，并在可能的情况下，争取释放人质，从而导致整个人质事件的结束。
    但在议员方面，各种谴责声响遍国会山。有的指责黎巴嫩什叶派组织，要求政府部门对恐怖主义不能示弱；有的则指责以色列为了自身利益独断专行，挑起事端，危及美国人质。而一般公众关心的是美国人质的命运，他们要求政府部门作出一切努力，使人质不受伤害。
    近几天来，美国拯救人质的外交行动已有某些进展，有关方面显示出松动的迹象，但离解决人质危机仍有相当距离。首先，伊朗新总统拉夫桑贾尼关于协助美国解决人质问题的讲话，引起了美国官方的重视。其次是黎巴嫩什叶派组织和以色列当局改变了原来的强硬立场，开始公开谈论如何进行交换人质的交易，从而缓解了危机，使美国获得了进一步开展外交活动的时机。但不论从那一方的言论看，目前还不可能迅速解决人质问题。美国熟悉中东问题的一些专家认为，由于人质问题的背景复杂，各方受到的牵制因素颇多，人质交易将会是个“漫长的过程”。
    至今，以色列的主张与黎巴嫩什叶派组织的主张相距甚远。以色列坚持在交换中首先要释放以色列士兵，它声称，只有在释放以色列士兵的条件下，才能用奥贝德同西方人质作交换，否则就谈不上任何交易，而什叶派组织则要以色列首先释放奥贝德才能进一步会谈交换人质和战俘的问题。因此，围绕着人质交易，讨价还价将会是十分艰难的。
    从美国的立场看，美国官方虽然未正式改变它不同扣押人质的人进行谈判的政策，但已采取了较灵活的态度，也不反对以色列进行交易。它希望的是各方都释放人质，今后也不再出现绑架人质事件。在今后一个时期，它将会继续通过间接、直接的渠道，敦促有关各方采取有利于美国人质获释的行动，从而摆脱人质危机的困扰。至于军事行动，美国当权者虽未完全排除，但也承认这并不是理想的选择，因此只要不出现意外情况，美国似乎也不会贸然行动。
