	State Chairman Yang Shangkun met with the Chairman of the Asian Olympic Council, Sheikh Fahd Ahmad Al-Sabah, this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. Yang said: Hosting the 11th Asian Games is a common cause of the Asian people, and the success of the Asian Games is a shared success of the Asian people. The Chinese government and the Beijing municipal government will spare no effort to ensure the success of the Asian Games.

	Yang Shangkun expressed his gratitude for Sheikh Fahd's enthusiastic support for China's hosting of the Asian Games and his valuable suggestions regarding the preparations. He said, the Chinese government and the Beijing municipal government are treating the hosting of the Asian Games as a major undertaking and have been making every effort to prepare for it. Even during the recent period of unrest in Beijing, the construction of Asian Games facilities did not stop. Now, the situation in China is stable, and the situation in Beijing is calm. The people's lives have returned to normal, and the conditions for successfully hosting the Asian Games are in place. There are still 392 days until the opening of the Asian Games. We must complete all preparations, especially strengthen the publicity work for the Asian Games.

	Yang Shangkun said, our greatest wish is that all 38 member organizations of the Asian Olympic Council can send teams to participate in the Asian Games. We hope that through the successful hosting of the Asian Games, we can further promote solidarity among Asian countries and achieve the goal of "Unity, Friendship, Progress" for the 11th Asian Games. He wished the Asian Games a complete success.

	Sheikh Fahd expressed his thanks for the warm reception he received during his visit to China. He said, before my visit to China, Western media had reported that the preparations for the Beijing Asian Games had not begun. After arriving in Beijing, I saw that the relevant Chinese authorities were working day and night to make solid preparations for the success of the Asian Games, which made me very happy and reassured. The Chinese government and people have such a strong desire to successfully host the Asian Games, so the Asian Games will definitely be successful. The recent events in Beijing are purely China's internal affairs. All Asian countries are looking forward to participating in the Asian Games, and the common wish of the Asian people is to successfully host the Asian Games. If someone tries to disrupt this, it will be futile.

	Relevant officials Chen Xitong, Wu Shaozou, Zhang Baifa, and others attended the meeting.

    杨主席会见亚奥理事会主席法赫德时说
    中国将尽全力办好亚运会
    法赫德称赞中国做了踏踏实实的准备工作
    本报北京8月25日讯　记者温宪报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天下午在人民大会堂会见了亚洲奥林匹克理事会主席谢赫·法赫德·艾哈迈德·萨巴赫亲王。杨主席说：办好第十一届亚运会是亚洲人民共同的事业，亚运会的成功是亚洲人民共同的成功。中国政府、北京市政府将尽全力把亚运会开好。
    杨尚昆对法赫德亲王热情支持中国举办亚运会和对亚运会准备工作提出很好的意见表示感谢。他说，中国政府和北京市政府把办好亚运会当作一件很大的事情来办，一直在尽全力做好亚运会的准备工作。即使在北京前一段几十天不平静的日子里，亚运会工程建设也没有停止。现在，中国的局势是稳定的，北京的局势也是平静的，人民的生活秩序已恢复正常，已经具备成功举办亚运会的条件。现在，离亚运会的召开还有392天，我们一定要做好各项准备工作，特别是要加强对亚运会的宣传工作。
    杨尚昆说，我们最大的愿望就是亚洲奥林匹克委员会现有的38个成员组织都能派队前来参加亚运会。我们希望通过亚运会的成功召开，进一步促进亚洲国家之间的团结，实现第十一届亚运会“团结·友谊·进步”的宗旨。他预祝亚运会取得圆满成功。
    法赫德亲王对他此次来华所受到的热情款待表示感谢。他说，在我此次来华之前，西方舆论曾宣传说北京亚运会工程准备工作还没有开始。到了北京以后，看到中国有关方面每天日以继夜地为亚运会的成功踏踏实实地做了大量准备工作，使我很高兴，也放心了。中国政府和人民有这样强烈的愿望办好亚运会，亚运会一定会很成功。前一段在北京发生的事完全是中国的内政。所有的亚洲国家都在期待参加亚运会，亚洲人民的共同愿望是办好亚运会。如果有人想借机破坏，那将是无济于事的。
    有关方面负责人陈希同、伍绍祖、张百发等参加了会见。
