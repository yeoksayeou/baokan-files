Recently, I saw a report which investigated the income situation of employees in more than ten state-owned enterprises in a county. It was found that the average income of producers last year was 1,700 yuan, while the average annual income of the factory managers was 11,000 yuan, more than six times that of the employees. The highest-paid manager's annual income was 13 times that of the employees. In a county pharmaceutical factory, two salesmen had a combined pure income of over 80,000 yuan last year, which accounted for more than 44% of the total annual wage income of all employees in the factory. The significant income disparity between producers and managers is a new phenomenon of inequitable distribution within enterprises that deserves attention.

In the past, under the "iron rice bowl" system, enterprise employees were treated equally regardless of their work effort or performance. In recent years, enterprises have implemented various forms of economic responsibility systems, rewarding hard work and punishing laziness. Different positions and performance levels have led to income disparities. At the same time, the state has made corresponding regulations, allowing managers' incomes to be 1 to 3 times higher than those of producers based on the enterprise's operating conditions. Undoubtedly, continuing to overcome egalitarianism and seriously implementing the principle of distribution according to work remains a major issue that enterprises should pay attention to at present.

However, some departments and enterprises overly and one-sidedly emphasize the role of managers. During factory contract negotiations, managers' remuneration is disproportionately high. In some cases, the internal distribution system of the enterprise is unreasonable, or managers use their power for personal gain without effective supervision, leading to excessive income disparities between managers and producers. This new phenomenon of inequitable distribution affects the enthusiasm of employees for production and labor.

Both producers and managers are owners of the enterprise. If there are differences, it is only in terms of division of labor, position, and responsibility. The enterprise cannot function without the enthusiasm of managers, nor can it function without the enthusiasm of producers. Imagine, without the efforts of producers, even the best decisions will be in vain. It is the combination of both that is crucial. To motivate both managers and producers, reasonable distribution is a key factor. That is to say, within the scope of national regulations, the principle of distribution according to work should be implemented, and income gaps should be appropriately widened but not excessively. For example, in the aforementioned county's state-owned enterprises, the income gap between managers and producers is 6 to 13 times, how can producers have enthusiasm?

To solve these problems, the first step is for the supervising departments of the enterprises to do a good job in implementing national policies. Wage and bonus distributions within the scope of managers' authority should be discussed at the staff and worker representative congress. Managers of well-managed enterprises should be rewarded, but care should be taken to avoid duplicate rewards. It is necessary for enterprise leaders to engage in operational activities, but they should also pay attention to frugality. The majority of workers are reasonable people. By paying attention to overcoming inequities in enterprise internal distribution, their morale will improve, which is beneficial for the development of the enterprise and the stability of society.

    注意克服企业内部分配不公现象
    小可
    最近看到一份材料，有个县对十几家国有企业职工收入情况进行调查，发现生产者去年人均收入为1700元，而这些厂厂长的年人均收入为11000元，是职工人均收入的6倍多，最高的厂长年收入是职工收入的13倍。有个县制药厂的两个供销员，去年纯收入共8万多元，占了全厂职工年工资收入总额的44％还多。生产者与经营者收入相差悬殊，是企业内部分配不公的新情况，值得注意。
    过去，在“大锅饭”体制下，企业职工是“干多干少一个样，干好干坏一个样”。这些年来，企业实行各种形式的经济责任制，奖勤罚懒，岗位不同，工作好坏不一样，收入就有了差别。同时，国家也作出相应的规定，根据企业经营的情况，允许经营者的收入高于生产者1至3倍。毫无疑问，继续克服平均主义，认真执行按劳分配原则，仍是企业当前应该注意的主要问题。
    但是，有些部门、有些企业过分地、片面地强调经营者的作用，在工厂承包合同时，经营者的报酬偏高；也有的是企业内部分配制度不合理，或者经营者以权谋私而又缺乏有效的监督，造成经营者和生产者收入差别太大，出现新的分配不公现象，影响了职工生产劳动的积极性。
    企业的生产者和经营者都是企业的主人，要说有区别的话，只是分工不同，岗位不同，职责不同，企业离开了经营者的积极性不行，离开了生产者的积极性也不行。试想，没有生产者的努力，再好的决策也会落空的，必须是两方面积极性的结合。企业要调动经营者和生产者的积极性，合理分配是个至关重要的因素。也就是说，要在国家规定的范围内，实行按劳分配原则，收入要适当拉开距离，但不能悬殊过大。像上述那个县的一些国有企业，经营者和生产者的收入相差6倍甚至13倍，生产者怎么能有积极性？
    解决这些问题，首先是企业的主管部门要做好工作，执行国家政策；属于企业经营者职权范围内的工资、奖金分配，应经职代会讨论。对经营得好的企业的经营者要奖励，但要注意不重复奖励。企业领导人开展经营活动是必要的，但要注意节俭。广大职工是通情达理的，注意克服企业内部分配不公现象，他们的心气顺了，才有利于企业的发展，有利于社会的稳定。
