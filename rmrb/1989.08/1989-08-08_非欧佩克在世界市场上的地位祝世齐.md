In 1988, the world's oil production was 3.025 billion tons. Of this, non-OPEC countries produced 1.994 billion tons, accounting for 65% of the total, a 3% decrease compared to 1987. This was mainly due to the sharp increase in OPEC's oil production. In 1988, OPEC's production was 1.03 billion tons, an 11% increase from 1987.

Non-OPEC oil-producing countries can be roughly divided into three categories based on their position in international oil trade. The first category includes major oil-consuming countries like the United States and Canada. Their domestic oil production can only meet half of their domestic demand, with the rest entirely dependent on imports. The second category includes countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, and Denmark. These countries can fully supply their own energy needs and have the capacity to export oil. The third category includes countries like the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, and Egypt. For these countries, oil export earnings are a significant source of foreign exchange income.

The United States has entered the natural depletion phase of its oil reserves. Daily crude oil production decreased from 8.68 million barrels in 1986 to 8.35 million barrels in 1987, and further to 8.11 million barrels in 1988. By the end of 1988, the quantity of oil imports for the first time exceeded domestic production. This trend indicates that Western oil-consuming countries, led by the United States, are increasingly dependent on global oil supply, which helps to push up oil prices.

Industrialized countries like the United Kingdom and Norway have invested heavily in the North Sea oil fields, with annual production reaching 170 million tons. Although low oil prices have a negative impact on global oil exploration, the United Kingdom and Norway continue to strengthen capital and technology investment, vigorously developing North Sea oil fields, and reducing current drilling costs to one-third of what they were a decade ago. At the same time, low oil prices help reduce domestic industrial production costs and enhance the competitiveness of their manufactured goods in the international market. Therefore, oil price fluctuations have both positive and negative effects on these countries.

The Soviet Union exports approximately 137 million tons of crude oil annually, accounting for 21% of its domestic production. In 1987, oil export earnings were 228 billion rubles, accounting for 33% of its total foreign exchange earnings. More than 60% of its hard currency earnings come from oil exports. Therefore, the quantity of oil exports and the level of oil prices are extremely important for the Soviet Union.

From this, it can be seen that non-OPEC oil-producing countries, due to differences in their oil consumption levels and oil trade balances, react differently to oil price fluctuations. In the short term, the global market remains in a state of oversupply. In the long term, due to the natural depletion of oil reserves and the increase in domestic oil demand, non-OPEC crude oil production and export volumes will significantly decrease. OPEC will regain its dominant position in the oil market.

    非欧佩克在世界市场上的地位祝世齐
    1988年世界石油产量为30.25亿吨，其中非欧佩克国家产量为19.94亿吨，占总量的65％，与1987年相比减少3％。这主要是由于欧佩克石油产量猛增所致。1988年欧佩克产量10.3亿吨，比1987年增加11％。
    非欧佩克产油国按其石油贸易在国际贸易中的地位大致可分为三类。第一类是美国、加拿大等石油消费大国。它们国内石油产量仅能满足其国内需求的一半，不足部分完全依赖进口。第二类是英国、挪威、丹麦等。它们的能源可以完全自给，并且有能力出口石油。第三类是苏联、墨西哥、中国、埃及等国。它们的石油出口收入是其外汇收入的重要来源之一。
    美国现已进入石油储量的自然衰减期。原油日产量从1986年的868万桶下降到1987年的835万桶，1988年的811万桶。1988年底，石油进口数量第一次超过国内产量。这一势头表明以美国为主的西方石油消费国对世界石油供应的依赖性增强。这有助于油价升高。
    英国、挪威等工业发达国家在北海油田已经投入大量的资本，年产量达1.7亿吨。尽管低油价对世界石油勘探产生不利的影响，英国、挪威依然加强资本和技术的投入，大力开发北海油田，并使目前的开采井成本低于十年前的1／3。同时，低油价有利于降低其国内工业的生产成本，提高制成品的海外竞争力。因此，油价的波动对它们的影响利弊参半。
    苏联原油年出口量约1.37亿吨，占其国内产量的21％。1987年石油出口收入2280亿卢布，占其整个外汇收入的33％，其中硬通货收入中的60％以上依靠石油出口。因此，石油出口数量和油价水平对苏联来讲极为重要。
    由此可知，非欧佩克产油国因其石油消费水平、石油贸易收支状况的差异，对油价波动的反应也不同。从近期看，世界市场仍处于供过于求的基本格局。从长期看，受石油储量自然衰减和国内石油需求上升的影响，非欧佩克原油产量、出口数量将明显下降，欧佩克将恢复其对石油市场的支配作用。
