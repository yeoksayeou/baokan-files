Public Security Department Announces Four Serious Cases of Extortion and Bribery

Beijing, August 14th - The Public Security Department recently issued a notice, announcing four serious cases of extortion and bribery. These cases were investigated and handled by local public security organs under the leadership of the Public Security Department and local party committees and governments, as part of their efforts to strengthen anti-corruption measures.

Zhang Ma Yun, a former household registration officer at the Daxinan Street Public Security Substation in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, colluded with criminal elements from 1984 to April 1988 to illegally register 60-plus individuals from rural areas as Guangzhou residents, extorting over 210,000 yuan in the process. Zhang Ma Yun was sentenced to death and deprivation of political rights for life by the Guangzhou People's Court on June 19, 1989.

Wang De Cai, former deputy secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission and director of the Public Security Bureau in Nanping, Fujian Province, was arrested on July 31 for serious violations of law and discipline. It has been confirmed that Wang De Cai embezzled and accepted bribes totaling tens of thousands of yuan, extorted money from Hong Kong businessmen, and had improper relationships with several women. Other leads related to Wang's extortion and bribery are currently under investigation.

Song Mei Ying, former director of the Household Registration Office of the Linyi Public Security Bureau in Shandong Province, used her authority over household registration approvals to extort and accept bribes after taking the position of deputy director in 1984 (and director in 1986). Upon the discovery of the case, over 150,000 yuan in cash and bank deposits were seized from her home, along with a large number of items including three refrigerators, three color televisions, two VCRs, six tape recorders, one air conditioner, four sets of high-end furniture, and over 2,900 bottles of domestic and foreign liquor such as Maotai and French cognac. Additionally, there were large quantities of dried shrimp, sea cucumber, prawns, scallops, and various exquisite crafts. Song Mei Ying also used the opportunity to obtain 13 tons of low-priced steel and one refrigerator, which she then resold at a high price, earning over 21,000 yuan in illegal profits. The case is currently under trial.

Fang Yi Qiang, an official in the Entry and Exit Management Office of the Fujian Public Security Department, exploited his position to steal 122 blank "Exit Registration Cards" from September 1988 to April 1989. He forged signatures and stamps, selling 114 cards illegally, allowing 57 people to exit the country illegally. Fang Yi Qiang extorted over 100,000 yuan in the process and has been arrested.

The Public Security Department's notice emphasized that resolutely eliminating corruption within the public security forces is a crucial measure to maintain the impartiality and integrity of public security organs, enforce the law strictly, and uphold the dignity of the government and the law. The notice calls on all levels of public security organs to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, seriously investigate and handle various illegal and criminal cases, especially major cases of corruption. Those involved in serious and harmful corruption must be brought to justice. At the same time, strict education must be provided to all public security personnel to instill a sense of self-respect, self-discipline, and self-love, strengthen the concept of law-abiding behavior, resist corruption, and resolutely fight against all corrupt practices, living up to the honorable title of "People's Protectors."
