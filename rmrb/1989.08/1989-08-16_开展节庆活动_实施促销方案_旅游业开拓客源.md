Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 16th.

    The People's Daily has learned from the National Tourism Administration that China will launch a series of tourism activities themed around festivals in the second half of this year and next year. The goal is to attract overseas tourists and help the tourism industry recover from its current slump.

    As a major component of China's "revitalizing tourism" plan, this promotion scheme calls for mobilizing both central and local governments. In addition to ensuring the success of the "World Tourism Day" activities in Xi'an and the "Confucius Cultural Festival" in Qufu in the second half of this year, regions such as Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, which are key areas for receiving compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, are required to organize activities of a certain scale during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Double Ninth Festival (Chongyang Festival), the Spring Festival, the Qingming Festival, and the birthday of Mazu (March 23rd on the lunar calendar).

    Major activities planned for next year include the "Asian Games," the "Exhibition of Cultural Relics," and the "Arts and Shopping Festival."

    The tourism situation in China over the next two years is extremely severe. The "revitalization" plan includes three main aspects: First, conducting strong promotional and recruitment work; second, rectifying the workforce, improving the service quality and reputation of China's tourism industry, and seriously eliminating practices such as "guided tours," demanding "tips," and accepting kickbacks; third, working hard to increase revenue and reduce expenditures.

    开展节庆活动  实施促销方案
    旅游业开拓客源
    本报讯　记者刘霄从国家旅游局获悉：我国将于今年下半年和明年推出一系列以节庆活动为主题的旅游活动，目的在于广招海外游客，使旅游客源尽快走出低谷。
    作为我国“重振旅游”主要组成部分的这一促销方案，要求调动中央和地方两个积极性，除切实办好下半年已确定的西安“世界旅游日”活动和曲阜“孔子文化节”活动以外，广东、福建、浙江、江苏等港澳台同胞的重点接待地区，在中秋节和农历九月九日“妈祖升天日”，明年春节、清明节和农历三月二十三日“妈祖生日”之际，都要组织一定规模的活动。
    明年的大型活动自然推“亚运会”为首，还有“文物精品大展”和“艺术节和购物节活动”等。
    今明两年我国旅游客源形势极为严峻。“重振”计划包括三方面内容：一是开展强有力的宣传招徕工作；二是整顿职工队伍，提高中国旅游业的服务质量和信誉，认真清除“看线服务”，索要“小费”，私受回扣等不正之风；三是艰苦奋斗，增收节支。
