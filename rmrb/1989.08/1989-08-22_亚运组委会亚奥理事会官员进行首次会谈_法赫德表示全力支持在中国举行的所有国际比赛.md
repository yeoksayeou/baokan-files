Officials from the Asian Games Organizing Committee and the Olympic Council of Asia Hold First Meeting

Prince Fahd Expresses Full Support for All International Competitions Held in China

Beijing, August 22nd - Reporter Li Beida reports: This morning, Wu Shaozu, the executive chairman of the 11th Asian Games Organizing Committee, and Zhang Baifa, the deputy chairman, met with Prince Fahd Al-Sabah, the president of the Olympic Council of Asia, and Secretary-General Mehta at the Beijing Olympic Hotel for their first meeting.

During the meeting, Prince Fahd and other officials from the Olympic Council of Asia first viewed a video and slides about the preparations for the 11th Asian Games. They then listened to a report by Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa on the preparations for the Asian Games.

Zhang Baifa told the prince, "As a deputy mayor, I am now dedicating 90% of my energy to the Asian Games. The more I work on it, the more enthusiastic I become, and I often receive good news." Zhang Baifa specifically mentioned to Prince Fahd that Premier Li Peng had recently allocated 150 million yuan to the Asian Games Organizing Committee, and the fundraising department receives an average of 7 remittance slips per day. At this point, Wu Shaozu interjected, "Currently, we are also issuing sports lottery tickets to raise funds, and the results are very good."

After watching the video and slides and listening to the report, Prince Fahd's face showed satisfaction. He said, "What I have seen and heard is completely different from what I heard before coming to Beijing. Many things are not known outside. The Olympic Council of Asia fully supports all international competitions held in China. Of course, there will be some people who do not fully support it. Since the first Olympic Games in 1896, sports competitions have always been subject to various interferences, but in the end, none of them have achieved their goals."

After the meeting, Prince Fahd and other officials from the Olympic Council of Asia, accompanied by Wu Shaozu and Zhang Baifa, visited the Haidian Sports Hall and the Beijing Institute of Physical Education Gymnasium.

Tomorrow, Prince Fahd will continue to visit the Asian Games venues and facilities and will discuss specific issues such as security, television broadcasting, and communication methods with the organizing committee officials.

    亚运组委会亚奥理事会官员进行首次会谈
    法赫德表示全力支持在中国举行的所有国际比赛
    本报北京8月22日讯　记者李北大报道：今天上午，第11届亚运会组委会执行主席伍绍祖和常务副主席张百发在北京奥林匹克饭店与亚奥理事会主席谢·法赫德亲王以及秘书长梅赫塔等官员进行首次会谈。
    会谈中，法赫德亲王等亚奥理事会官员首先观看了第11届亚运会筹备工作的录像片和幻灯片，然后听取了张百发副市长关于亚运会准备工作的汇报。
    张百发对亲王说，他这个副市长现在拿出90％的精力搞亚运会，越搞越有劲，而且经常得到好消息。张百发特意向法赫德亲王提到，最近李鹏总理批给亚运会组委会1.5亿人民币，集资部每天平均接收7张汇款单。这时，伍绍祖插话，“目前我们还发行体育奖券进行集资，效果很好”。
    法赫德亲王在看了录像、幻灯，听了汇报后，脸上露出满意的笑容。他说：“我的所见所闻和来北京之前所听到的完全不同，许多是我在外边了解不到的，我们亚奥理事会全力支持在中国举行的所有国际比赛。当然，举办亚运会会有一些人不那么赞成。从1896年第一届奥林匹克运动会至今，体育比赛都受到各种干扰，但最后都没有能达到目的”。
    会谈结束后，法赫德亲王等亚奥理事会官员在伍绍祖、张百发等陪同下参观了北京海淀体育馆和北京体育学院体育馆。
    明天，法赫德亲王将继续参观亚运会场馆设施，并将就亚运会安全、电视转播、通讯手段等具体问题与组委会官员协商。
