Here, once stood the Central Revolutionary Base during the Second Revolutionary Civil War and the starting point of the 25,000-mile Long March. Here, again, is the Jiangxi Province's economic reform experimental zone established last year. Standing on the 39,000 square kilometers of land in southern Jiangxi, one can feel the deep and profound revolutionary traditions of the red land, as well as the immense vitality and changes brought by reform and opening up.

As the nation celebrates its 40th anniversary, the cadres and masses of southern Jiangxi look back on the 1.5 years of the experimental zone, their faces and eyes radiating genuine joy and pride. Here's what they have to say:

- 95% of enterprises have implemented contract and lease management, with 85% of them adopting open bidding, injecting vitality into state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Clear policies have also promoted the steady development of collective and private enterprises. In 1988, the region's industrial output value increased by 29% compared to the previous year.

- Six measures to develop agriculture have mobilized the enthusiasm of farmers. Eight mu of land is cultivated meticulously, and eight mu of mountain is developed extensively. In 1.5 years, grain production has increased by nearly 100,000 tons, and oil, tea, citrus, and aquatic products have all seen bountiful harvests.

- Opening the gates, removing barriers, and facing Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan, participating in large-scale circulation. 189 barriers hindering circulation have been removed, and over 100 markets have been opened along the 400-kilometer border with Fujian and Guangdong, with bulk agricultural and sideline products flowing out continuously.

- Implementing the "support, follow-up, and replacement" policy adapted to the development of the coastal economy, and fully opening up resources and enterprises. 601 horizontal economic and technological cooperation contracts have increased the region's tax revenue by 69 million yuan.

- Originally, 18 counties and cities had 11 counties with fiscal subsidies. After expanding the economic management authority of counties and cities by 25 items, the situation has changed dramatically, with each county increasing its revenue. 15 counties have fiscal revenues exceeding 10 million yuan, and Ganzhou City has become the first county-level city in the province with an annual income exceeding 100 million yuan, with the region increasing its revenue by 80 million yuan in one year.

- The Gan-Gui West Line highway was opened at the end of last year, the Golden Airport resumed operations, and the first phase of the network with Nanchang was completed. The construction of 10,000 programmable controlled telephones is underway. Infrastructure is being strengthened, and the investment environment is improving.

From January 1, 1988, to now, the establishment of the experimental zone is just the first step. However, this step is so firm, so steady, and so significant!

This step has brought confidence and pride. The old revolutionary base has limited information, barren land, and a backward economy. Establishing the experimental zone, people have turned pressure into motivation. "Waiting, relying, and begging" is no longer an option; we must "work, pioneer, and innovate." The spirit of hard work and selfless dedication permeates two eras, and the will to actively strive and persevere shapes a new generation.

Practice has proven that, with the focus on revitalizing enterprises, developing township enterprises, and activating circulation, and with the overall development of agriculture through the comprehensive development of land resources, the series development of agricultural and sideline products, and the two-way development of labor resources, the region's economy can be driven, and the market can be catalyzed. This strategy, which suits the local conditions, has taken root in people's hearts.

Southern Jiangxi's first step has moved out of Yugutai and broken through Xiaomei Pass. We firmly believe that its second and third steps will be even more magnificent and solid!

### 南门—赣州，迈开改革的坚实步伐

    南门—赣州，迈开改革的坚实步伐
    这里，曾是第二次国内革命战争时期中央根据地和二万五千里长征的始发地；这里，又是江西省去年创办的经济体制改革试验区。站在赣南39000平方公里的土地上，你可以感受到红色故土革命传统积淀的深沉与敦厚，同时又可以感受到改革开放带来的巨大活力与变迁。
    在迎接国庆40周年的日子里，赣南的干部和群众回顾改革试验区一年半的经历，面容和眼神无不透射出由衷的喜悦和骄傲。且看：
    ——95％的企业实行承包和租赁经营，其中85％实行公开招标，给国营大中型企业注入了活力。明确的政策又促使集体企业和私营企业稳步发展。1988年全区工业产值较上年增加29％。
    ——开发农业的六项措施调动了农民的积极性，8分地里深耕细作，8亩山上大展宏图。一年半，粮食增产近10万吨，油、茶、柑桔、水产全面丰收。
    ——开放门户，撤关拆卡，面向闽粤琼，参与大流通。189个阻碍流通的关卡撤销了，与闽粤400公里的边界上开放上百个集市，大宗农副土特产品源源流出。
    ——贯彻适应沿海经济发展的“支持、跟进、接替”方针，实行资源、企业全方位开放。601项横向经济技术协作合同使全区新增利税6900万元。
    ——原18个县市11个财政吃补贴，扩大县市经济管理权限25条规定一下达，面貌大变，县县增收，15个县财政收入超千万元，赣州市成为全省第一个年收入超亿元的县级市，全区一年增收8000万元。
    ——赣粤西线公路去年年底开通，黄金机场复航，与南昌联网一期工程竣工，万门程控电话正在施工。基础设施在加强，投资环境在改善。
    从1988年元旦至今，创办试验区只是迈开了第一步。可是，这一步却是多么坚定，多么稳妥，多么巨大！
    这一步走出了信心和志气。老区信息不灵，土地贫瘠，经济落后；创办试验区，人们把压力转化成了动力。“等靠要”不行了，要“干闯创”。艰苦奋斗、无私奉献的精神贯穿着两个时代，积极进取、自强不息的意志陶冶着一代新人。
    实践证明，以搞活企业为中心，以发展乡镇企业和搞活流通为突破口，以国土资源立体开发、农副产品系列开发、劳力资源双向开发为农业总体开发的主攻方向，带动全区经济发展，催化市场发育，是行之有效的。这一符合区情的战略已深入人心。
    赣南的第一步已走出郁孤台，冲出小梅关。我们深信，它的第二步、第三步，必将迈得更加豪迈，更加坚实！
