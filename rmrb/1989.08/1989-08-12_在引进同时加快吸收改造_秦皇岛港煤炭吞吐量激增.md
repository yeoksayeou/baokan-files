Qinhuangdao Port Bureau has simultaneously accelerated the absorption and transformation of imported equipment while also leveraging advanced foreign technology to upgrade old equipment. This has resulted in a significant increase in the port's coal handling capacity, from 8.5 million tons in 1979 to the current 25 million tons, surpassing the coal handling capacity of Norfolk Port on the east coast of the United States and making it the world's largest coal export port.

Since 1982, Qinhuangdao Port has utilized foreign capital to import state-of-the-art port equipment from Japan, the United States, West Germany, Austria, and other countries. This has facilitated the expansion of 11 deep-water berths with a capacity of 10,000 tons each, adding over 50 million tons of handling capacity. The port has organized teams consisting of technical management personnel, engineering technicians, and skilled workers to adopt comprehensive production and maintenance management methods. This has improved the operational efficiency of the imported equipment from 64.4% in 1984 to over 90% in the following year. Various units under the port bureau have undertaken technical upgrades for over 30 projects, including the walking mechanism of high-power diesel locomotives co-produced with Hitachi of Japan and Alstom of France, the channel switching device of the radar and marine VHF communication system imported from Matsushita of Japan, and the control program of the automatic railcar dumper, among others. These upgrades have fully utilized the potential of the imported equipment.

To address the issue of domestic production of easily damaged parts for imported equipment, the port has organized dozens of technical research teams. They have successfully replaced imported parts, such as the stainless steel corrugated pipes from the full-rotation high-power tugboat diesel engines imported from Japan and the programmable pulse generators from General Electric of the United States, with domestically produced parts. These domestic parts, which cost only a fraction of the imported ones, have saved the country a significant amount of foreign exchange.

    在引进同时加快吸收改造  秦皇岛港煤炭吞吐量激增
    本报讯  秦皇岛港务局在加快设备引进消化吸收的同时，借鉴国外先进技术对老设备进行技术改造，使港口装运煤炭吞吐的能力从1979年的850万吨增加到目前的2500万吨，远远超过美国东海岸的诺福克港，成为世界最大的煤炭输出港。
    从1982年开始，秦皇岛港利用外资，从日本、美国、联邦德国、奥地利等国引进国际一流水平的现代化港口设备，扩建11个深水万吨级泊位，新增吞吐能力5000多万吨。他们组织以技术管理干部、工程技术人员和熟练技术工人为主的队伍，采取全员生产维修管理方法，使这批现代化港口设备的完好率从1984年的64.4％提高到去年的90％以上。港务局所属各单位先后对日本日立公司和法国阿尔斯通公司合作制造的大马力内燃机车的行走装置、从日本松下公司引进的雷达及海上甚高频通讯系统的频道转换装置，以及铁路自动翻车机的控制程序等30多个项目进行技术改造，充分发挥了引进设备的潜力。为了解决进口设备易损零部件的国产化问题，他们组织了几十个技术攻关小组，用价格低廉（仅为进口价格的几十分之一到几百分之一）的国产零部件，替代从日本引进的全回转式大马力拖轮内燃机的不锈钢波纹管、从美国通用电器公司引进的可编程序脉冲发生器等几十种零部件，从而为国家节约大量外汇。
