Li Peng Meets with Tsutomu Hato
Emphasizes China Will Not Return to Closed-Door Policy; Sino-Japanese Friendship Benefits Peace and Development

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 18 — (Reporter Yang Zidi) Premier Li Peng said today that the development of friendly neighborly relations between China and Japan not only serves the interests of the peoples of both countries but also benefits peace and development in Asia and the world.

Li Peng, during a meeting with the chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association and Senate member Tsutomu Hato at Zhongnanhai's Ziguang Pavilion, said that China's political situation is stable and its economy is developing. Misunderstandings about China in the international community will gradually decrease and eventually disappear with the passage of time.

He told Tsutomu Hato, who has long been dedicated to Sino-Japanese friendship, that China welcomes visits from various sectors of Japanese society and welcomes businesspeople from Japan to continue their efforts in promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries' economies.

Li Peng warmly welcomed Tsutomu Hato's visit and congratulated him on being awarded an honorary doctorate in law by Peking University.

Tsutomu Hato told Li Peng that the slogan "Sino-Japanese friendship for generations to come" is a common goal for Sino-Japanese friendship. For this purpose, he brought his son and grandson on this visit. Li Peng smiled and said, "They can become successors to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship." During the meeting, Li Peng happily recalled his pleasant encounter with Tsutomu Hato during his visit to Japan in April. He said that the visit was a great success, receiving warm and friendly hospitality from the Japanese government and people.

When discussing China's open-door policy, Li Peng said that this policy has not changed and will not change. China will not return to the old path of closing its doors and shutting itself off from the world, nor will it close the doors that have already been opened.

He said that there is currently a trend worth noting: some people in the West are trying to close this door. This goes against the historical trend and therefore will not succeed.

    李鹏会见宇都宫德马
    强调中国不走闭关自守老路  中日友好有利于和平与发展
    新华社北京八月十八日电　（记者杨子迪）国务院总理李鹏今天说，中日两国发展友好睦邻关系不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且有利于亚洲乃至世界的和平与发展。
    李鹏在中南海紫光阁会见日本日中友协会长、参议院议员宇都宫德马一行时说，中国的政局是稳定的，经济是发展的。国际上对中国的某些误解将随着时间的推移逐步减少，以至消失。
    他对长期致力于日中友好的宇都宫德马说，中国欢迎日本各界人士来华访问，欢迎日本经济界人士继续致力于发展两国经济的友好合作关系。
    李鹏对宇都宫德马的来访表示热烈欢迎，对他所获得北大授予的荣誉法学博士学位称号表示热烈祝贺。
    宇都宫德马对李鹏说，日中两国子子孙孙友好，是日中友好的共同口号。为了这个目的，他这次把儿子和孙子也带来了。李鹏笑着说：“他们可以成为中日友好事业的接班人。”会见时，李鹏愉快地忆及今年四月他访日时同宇都宫德马愉快相会的情景。他说，那次访日受到日本政府和人民热情友好的接待，访问取得圆满成功。
    在谈到中国的对外开放政策时，李鹏说，这一政策没有也不会改变。中国不会走到闭关自守的老路上去，不会自己把已经打开的大门再关上。
    他说，现在倒是有一种倾向值得注意，就是，西方某些人试图把这扇门关上。这是违反历史潮流的，因此是不会成功的。
