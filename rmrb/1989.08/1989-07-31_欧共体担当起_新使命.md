The European Community Commission announced on July 24 that it will convene an international conference on August 1. The conference will be attended by experts from the 12 EC countries, the 6 countries of the European Free Trade Association, as well as the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, totaling 23 countries. The agenda includes three items: 1. A comprehensive review of Western aid plans for Eastern Europe, including those currently being implemented and those planned; 2. An exchange of views on measures already taken and planned to promote economic reforms in Poland and Hungary; 3. A discussion on the specific measures to implement the tasks assigned by the summit of the seven major Western countries.

At this year's Paris summit of the seven major Western countries, one of the most surprising decisions was that the European Community Commission was entrusted with the task of preparing for an international conference to coordinate Western economic aid to Poland and Hungary. The EC has attended the summit of the seven major Western countries before, but this is the first time it has formally taken on a "major responsibility" in the evolving East-West relations and completed a new mission as a decision-making tool for the summit.

This "major responsibility" was entirely sought by the EC itself. According to local media reports, before the summit of the seven major Western countries, U.S. President Bush visited Poland and Hungary and promised to take a "leadership role" at the summit to urge allies to establish a small group to coordinate policies on economic aid to the East. However, at the July 14 meeting, Bush's proposal was immediately opposed by France and West Germany. France and West Germany, which are unwilling to completely follow the lead of the United States in the construction of the "European house," planned to pursue an "independent policy." The meeting thus became deadlocked. At this point, EC Commission President Jacques Delors proposed that the EC take on this task. On July 15, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl formally proposed that the EC Commission coordinate Western aid to Eastern Europe. Perhaps considering the weight of this "partner," or to avoid offending Moscow on the sensitive issue of Eastern Europe, Bush yielded, and thus, for the first time, the EC became a notable figure at the summit of the seven major Western countries and took on a "new mission."

After securing the task, the EC quickly sprang into action. On July 17, the day after the Paris summit concluded, the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 12 EC countries held consultations to implement aid to Poland and Hungary, deciding to draft an emergency plan to provide food aid to Poland. On July 19, the EC Commission proposed that member countries could use the EC's surplus resources to aid Poland. On July 24, the Council of Ministers of Agriculture of the EC unanimously agreed, without debate, to provide Poland with emergency food aid worth 12.5 million European Currency Units free of charge.

It is noteworthy that the EC's food reserves are not abundant. Since 1986, due to the reduction of agricultural expenditures and the disposal of surplus agricultural products in various ways, the EC's agricultural product reserves have significantly decreased. Except for wheat, the reserves of butter, milk powder, and beef are almost depleted, with only 12 tons of beef left. On July 26, it was reported that the EC planned to import some agricultural products from the international market to "support" Eastern Europe, which has not experienced famine or disaster.

At the same time, from July 19 to 26, the EC began its first round of talks with the Soviet Union to sign a 10-year economic and trade cooperation agreement. On July 25, the EC and Poland's economic and trade negotiations reached an agreement.

From this, it can be seen that the EC is taking on the "international responsibility" entrusted by the summit of the seven major Western countries with great urgency and effort.

The EC's proactive assumption and urgent completion of the "mission" entrusted by the summit of the seven major Western countries reflect some trends worth noting in the development of East-West relations: As the economic strength of the United States has relatively weakened, U.S.-European relations are beginning to move towards a more equal direction. The EC and other Western European countries are increasingly acting as an independent political and economic force in the world. At the same time, Western European countries want to build the "European house" according to their own will, values, and ideology. Western Europe believes it has its own advantages, as Delors said, Western Europe knows the "other Europe" very well, has strong economic power, and from the perspective of cooperation and dialogue, the EC has its conveniences. Compared to the United States, Western Europe's influence on Eastern Europe is more direct and realistic.

The political and media circles in Western Europe highly evaluate the EC's new mission, believing it is a "response" to the "European house." Delors emphasized that "this is a signal," indicating that the EC has "earned trust in recent years." The French Foreign Minister believes that it shows that there is a "European share" in East-West dialogue. *Le Figaro* put it more bluntly, saying that "the U.S. President may no longer be the legitimate monarch of the West." In short, the EC's all-out effort to complete this new mission makes people feel that in a multipolar world, the role of Western Europe, as one of the poles, is clearly visible in both political and economic terms.

### 欧共体担当起“新使命”

    欧共体担当起“新使命”
    本报记者　魏崴
    欧洲共同体委员会7月24日宣布，将于8月1日召开一次国际会议，由欧共体12国、欧洲自由贸易联盟6国，以及美国、日本、加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰共23国的专家参加。其议程为三项：1、全面审议西方对东欧的援助计划，正在实施的及准备采取的均在研究之列；2、就已经实行的以及打算实行的旨在促进“波兰和匈牙利经济改革”的各种措施，交换意见；3、讨论今后落实西方七国首脑会议委任的具体办法。
    在今年的七国首脑巴黎会议上，一项最出人意料的决定，是欧共体委员会受命筹备召开国际会议，协调西方国家对波、匈的经济援助。欧共体出席七国首脑会议非自本届始，但是，成为七国首脑会议的一个决策工具，在东西方关系演变中正式担当起“重大责任”，完成新的使命，却是头一回。
    这“重大责任”完全是欧共体自己争来的。据此间舆论透露，美国总统布什于7国首脑会议前访问波、匈，他曾许下诺言，要在会上以“领导身份”要求盟友在给予东方经济援助方面成立一小组，以协调政策。可是在7月14日的会上，布什的建议一出，立即遭到法国和西德的反对。因为不甘心在“欧洲大厦”的建设上完全听命于美国的法国和西德，打算奉行一个“独立的政策”。会议就此陷入僵局。欧共体委员会主席德洛尔此时提出由欧共体出面承担此事的建议，15日，西德总理科尔又正式提议，让欧共体委员会来协调西方对东欧的援助。或许是考虑到西德这个“伙伴”份量很重，或许是为避免在敏感的东欧问题上触犯莫斯科，总之，布什让步了，于是，欧共体破天荒地成为七国首脑会议上引人注目的角色，并且担当起“新的使命”。
    抢到任务之后，欧共体迅速行动起来。7月17日，即巴黎首脑会议闭幕翌日，欧共体12国外长理事会为落实对波、匈的援助进行磋商，决定草拟一项给予波兰食品援助的紧急计划。19日，欧共体委员会建议，为援助波兰，各成员国可以动用欧共体的剩余物资。24日，欧共体农业部长理事会未经辩论便一致同意，向波兰无偿提供价值1250万欧洲货币单位的紧急食品援助。
    耐人寻味的是，欧洲共同体的食品库存，并不丰裕。自1986年以来，由于削减农业开支，多方处理过剩农产品，欧共体的农产品库存量已经大为下降，除了小麦，黄油、奶粉的库存几近告罄，牛肉也只有12吨了。此间26日传出消息，欧共体打算到国际市场上进口部分农产品，以“支援”并没有发生饥饿和灾荒的东欧。
    与此同时，欧共体7月19—26日，与苏联开始首轮会谈，以便签订一项为期10年的经贸合作协定。25日，欧共体和波兰的经贸谈判达成协议。
    由此观之，欧共体对承担七国首脑会议所委托的“国际责任”，可谓急如星火，不遗余力。
    欧共体主动承担并急切地完成7国首脑会议所委托的“使命”，反映出东西方关系发展中一些值得重视的趋势：随着美国经济实力相对削弱，美欧关系开始向更加平等的方向演变。欧共体等西欧国家，越来越以一支独立的政治力量和经济力量在世界上发挥作用。同时，西欧国家要按照自己的意志、自己的价值观和意识形态去建设“欧洲大厦”。西欧认为它有它自己的优势，如德洛尔所说，西欧对“另一欧洲”相知甚深，又拥有强大经济实力，而且从合作和对话方面看，欧共体有其方便之处。比之美国，西欧对东欧的影响更直接、更现实。
    西欧政界、新闻界对欧共体的这一新的使命评价甚高，认为是对“欧洲大厦”的“回应”。德洛尔强调“这是一个信号”，“表明欧共体近年来赢得了信任”。法国外长则认为，它表明“在东西方对话中”，有了“欧洲的份儿”了。《费加罗报》说得更直截了当，它认为“美国总统可能不再是西方的法定君主了”。总之，欧共体此次全力以赴完成新使命，使人们感到，在一个多极化的世界中，西欧这一极，在政治上和经济上的作用已清晰可见。
