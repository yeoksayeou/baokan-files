On August 14, the first day of classes at Tsinghua University, Associate Professor Wei Jinduo from the Department of Mechanics started his "Theoretical Mechanics" lecture in English at 7:40 AM, just after the bell rang. As soon as he spoke his first sentence, the attentive students burst into applause. He was pleasantly surprised to find that the course, which usually had around 60 students, had attracted over 100.

Indeed, after experiencing a nightmare, the university students deeply cherished the peaceful learning atmosphere at the start of the new semester. As one student from the Law and Economic Law program at Renmin University of China said, "Returning to the classroom after four months feels so familiar! While we may not be able to fully make up for the lost learning, this lesson will stay with us for a lifetime."

At this time of year, the campus usually remains quiet, like a holiday. Therefore, many out-of-town students were experiencing Beijing's August heat for the first time. Beijing Medical University, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing University of Technology, Renmin University of China, and Tsinghua University all started classes earlier than usual.

After the turmoil, Tsinghua University regains its new look

In previous years, the tardiness rate at Tsinghua University was around 3%. This year, out of the 8,300 freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors who were supposed to return, only 11 did not return without a valid reason. Many students even returned early to review and make up for lost time. Approximately 64 classes, with nearly 2,000 students, returned to campus about ten days before the start of classes to participate in internships or course design. On the evening before classes started, the Academic Affairs Office checked 81 classrooms between 8:30 PM and 9:30 PM and found 1,283 students studying diligently.

Teachers, who were initially uncertain about the students' enthusiasm for learning, were reassured after the start of classes. They reported that most students listened attentively, and the classroom order was excellent.

To prepare for this day and to restore the campus's elegance and tranquility, the faculty and staff of Tsinghua University worked tirelessly. Before the start of classes, the president, dean of academic affairs, and dean of administration, along with other department heads, inspected the campus environment, teaching facilities, and course arrangements. The administrative staff also forwent their summer vacation to clean the walls of the dining halls and dormitories, which had been covered with posters. The administrative department also conducted a comprehensive inspection and repair of the desks and chairs.

Tsinghua University has regained its former glory.

Reflecting on the turmoil, the students' hearts are still turbulent

Reflective learning is an essential lesson for university students after the start of the new semester.

On the first day of concentrated learning, the atmosphere in the classroom of Class 71861 at Beijing University of Technology was somber and awkward. Despite the efforts of the class leaders, everyone remained silent. At this moment, President Zhu appeared at the classroom door. He might have sensed something from the students' expressions, so he spoke to them passionately and sincerely, "During the turmoil, someone posted a big-character poster about me, but I am not afraid, and I do not blame these students. As a president, in critical moments, one can set aside everything, but the faith in the Party and the sense of responsibility for the country cannot be abandoned. This is the fundamental standpoint, and it must be firm." "Do you know how much our school has lost due to the turmoil? It is hundreds of millions, even billions of yuan... On April 27, the representative of a foreign company that was about to invest in our school came to the school gate, saw the situation, and said to me, 'Let's talk about it later,' and left."

The president's words shook the students. Some lowered their heads, while others looked at their president with apologetic eyes. The students gradually opened up and spoke from their hearts. They frankly discussed their many shortcomings, such as political immaturity and arrogance, one-sided and shallow understanding, and blindly following others. Some students who participated in the hunger strike mentioned that they initially had the wish to punish corruption and promote democracy but did not expect it to have a negative impact. Some students, with tears in their eyes, said that at that time, they could not listen to any positive voices and were completely surrounded by rumors, and now they regret it.

The vast ocean of learning requires a correct direction

Renmin University of China is also eagerly awaiting the resumption of classes. On August 21, the first day of make-up classes, Associate Professor Huang Zhongchi of the Philosophy Department taught the Marxist Principles course to 81 students from the Law and Economic Law program of Class 88. In recent years, the attendance rate for this course has been around 80%, but this class reached 98%. The students listened attentively. During the break, some students shared their thoughts: "A political storm has made us much more mature. Through learning and reflection, we have understood many truths, but some problems remain unsolved. We strongly hope to seek help from the theoretical weapons of Marxism, so..."

Professor Huang was also deeply moved: "This course needs to be reformed to be better and more lively, so that bourgeois liberalization has no market."

The History Department of Class 86 had no make-up classes, and the students were writing their personal reflection essays in their dormitories and reading rooms. During the turmoil, this class intermittently completed their courses, and the martial law was issued when the students had already gone to their off-campus internships as planned. After the school reopened on August 19, they brought the instructions from their parents and the results of their internships and, according to the school's arrangements, spent a week studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party. They had a basic correct understanding of the nature, root causes, and harm of the turmoil. Some students shared their experiences: During the turmoil, they had hoped that all sectors of society would support the students. After going to factories and rural areas, they saw how tense industrial and agricultural production was and how workers and farmers worked selflessly day and night. They deeply felt that their thoughts were not in harmony with the country's construction and reform and were ashamed of the workers and farmers. If all sectors of society went on strike, production would be severely disrupted, and what kind of patriotism would that be?

The library, which remained open during the turmoil and riot, was now bustling with activity: students were returning and borrowing books, and lines formed at the open-shelf borrowing area. The reading rooms, however, remained quiet, with students flipping through recent newspapers and magazines. The library staff also organized an exhibition of photographs from the suppression of the riot. Attentive readers noticed that books that obviously promoted bourgeois liberalization had been quietly removed from the shelves and were no longer publicly displayed.

    新学年伊始的首都高校
    秦仁理
    8月14日，清华大学开学第一天。力学系副教授魏金铎等到7时40分上课铃响过之后，开始用英语讲授“理论力学”，他刚讲第一句话，凝神谛听的学生们便报以满堂掌声。他惊喜地发现，这门60余人选修的课程，竟来了100多人。
    的确，经历了一场恶梦的大学生在开学之初深切地体会到宁静的学习气氛弥足珍贵。正像中国人民大学法学和经济法专业88级的一个同学所说：“回到阔别4个月之久的课堂，太亲切了！学习的损失也许不能完全补回来，可这教训却够我们记一辈子的了。”
    往年的此时此刻，校园中还笼罩着一片假日的宁静，所以很多外地同学还是第一次领教北京八月的骄阳。北京医科大学、北京航空航天大学、北京理工大学、中国人民大学、清华大学相继提前开学。
    动乱过后　清华园重焕新姿
    往年清华大学开学的迟到率总在3％左右，而今年全校一到四年级本科生除在外地实习的以外，应到8300人中，无故未归的仅有11人。更有不少同学提前到校复习、补课。大约有64个班级近2000名学生在开学前十来天便返校参加实习或课程设计。在开学的前一天晚上，教务处在8时30分到9时30分这一个小时之间检查了81个教室，发现有1283名学生端坐着在自修。
    本来对学生的学习积极性尚无把握的教师在开学之后也心定了，他们反映，大多数学生听课十分认真，课堂秩序井然。
    为了这一天，为了校园的雅洁宁静，清华的教职员工付出了辛勤的汗水。在开学前的溽暑中，主管校长、教务长、总务长带领学校各有关部门负责人，逐一检查了校园环境、教学设施和课程安排，精心做好开学准备。学校后勤部门的教职工也放弃暑假休息，把曾经被重重叠叠的大小字报覆盖的食堂、宿舍楼等建筑物的墙壁洗刷得干干净净。行政部门则对课桌椅进行了全面加固检修。
    清华园焕发了新姿。
    痛定思痛　胸中犹有千尺浪
    学习反思是开学后大学生要补上的重要一课。
    集中学习的第一天，北京理工大学71861班教室的气氛郁闷中带着尴尬，尽管班干部一再努力，大家仍然缄口不语。这时，朱校长出现在教室门口。他从同学们的表情中可能看出了什么，于是他激动而诚恳地对大家说：“这次动乱中有人贴我的大字报，我不害怕，而且也不生这些同学的气。作为一个校长，在关键时刻自己的一切都可以抛开，唯独对党的信心和对国家的责任感不能丢。这是基本的立足点，一定要站稳。”“你们知道由于动乱，我们学校损失了多少吗？是几百万甚至上千万元啊……就在4月27日，准备到我校投资的国外某公司的代表，进校门一看形势，只对我说了一句‘以后再谈’，就走了。”校长的话震动了同学们，他们有的低下了头，有的用歉疚的眼光望着自己的校长……同学们也逐渐说出了心里话，他们在发言中结合自身的实际，直言不讳地谈了自身的许多不足。比如政治上的幼稚和自负，认识上的片面和肤浅，行动上的轻信和盲从，等等。有的参加绝食的同学谈到，当时抱着惩治腐败，推进民主的愿望，没想到起了不好的作用；有的同学含着眼泪说，在当时的情况下，听不进任何正面的声音，完全被谣言包围了起来，现在想起来真后悔。
    学海无涯  航行方向须端正
    中国人民大学也在期待着中断已久的上课铃。8月21日是学校补课第一天，哲学系黄仲池副教授为法学和经济法专业88级81名学生讲马克思主义原理课。近几年来这门课到课率维持在80％左右，这堂课却达到了98％。同学们听得全神贯注。课间有的学生谈了感想：“一场政治风波使我们成熟了许多。经过学习反思，懂了许多道理，但有些问题解决不了，强烈地希望求助于马克思主义的理论武器，所以……”黄老师此时也感慨万端：“这门课要改革得更好，讲得更生动，使资产阶级自由化没有市场。”
    历史系86级没有补课任务，同学们正分散在宿舍、阅览室写个人思想小结。动乱期间这个班断断续续上完了课，戒严令发布时学生已按计划去外地实习。学校于8月19日开学后，他们带着家长的嘱托，带着实习的成果，根据学校的安排，用一个星期的时间学习党的十三届四中全会精神，对动乱的性质、根源、危害有了基本正确的认识。有的同学谈了自己的体会：动乱中曾经希望社会各界都来声援学生，到了工厂农村，看到工农业生产那样紧张，工人农民没日没夜地忘我劳动，深感自己的想法与国家的建设和改革很不协调，有愧于工人农民。如果社会各界都去游行无人生产，势必对国家造成大的破坏，还有什么爱国可言？
    动乱暴乱期间一直照常开放的图书馆，此时更是一片繁忙：还书借书的学生熙来攘往，开架借书处排起了队，倒是阅览室仍然那么安静，没有课的学生翻阅着最近的报刊。图书馆工作人员还举办了平息暴乱图片展览，细心的读者注意到，那些明显宣扬资产阶级自由化的书籍，已悄然落架，不再公开陈列。
