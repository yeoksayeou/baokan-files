The fourth National Middle School Games (track and field events), hosted by Tangshan No. 1 Middle School, opened today. Eight athletes broke two records in the middle school games.

This is the first time that a national-level sports event has been held in a middle school in China. The organizers called this a reform. Representatives from 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, along with 10 specially invited middle schools, totaling 626 athletes and 216 team members, did not stay in hotels but resided, trained, and competed at Tangshan No. 1 Middle School. Officials from the State Education Commission, the Hebei Provincial Education Commission, and the event organizers also stayed and dined at the school.
