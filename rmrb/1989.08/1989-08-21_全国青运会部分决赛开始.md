The partial finals of the second National Youth Games, which will officially open on September 6, began today in four different competition zones, with three diving gold medals already awarded.

The diving finals for three events were held in Liaoyang. Guanshuqing from Guangdong and Guofang Chen from Guangxi won the gold medals in the women's A and B group one-meter springboard events, respectively. Tianling Wang from Shanghai secured the gold medal in the men's B group springboard event. The young athletes generally performed well on the first day, especially the Guangdong team, whose movements and difficulty levels reached a certain standard, with four athletes making it into the top three.

The rhythmic gymnastics competition, held in Jinzhou, featured team and individual all-around finals. In today's team competition, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu teams performed well, temporarily leading the scores.

In Dalian, the competition zones saw matches in field hockey and synchronized swimming. Each of the men's and women's field hockey teams had six teams participating, with no upsets in the first round. The synchronized swimming event featured four compulsory routines and a free routine for the individual competition, with 12 athletes competing in the pool. The competition was intense, and Min Tan from Sichuan stood out, leading in both routines and having a strong chance of winning the individual gold medal.

The badminton finals were held in Dandong, with men's and women's teams from three different teams competing in the team event today. According to the rules, there were supposed to be eight teams each for the men's and women's finals. However, due to the presence of overage players in the preliminary rounds, the Hebei men's team and the Hubei women's team were disqualified from participating in the finals. As a result, there are now seven teams each competing in the men's and women's team finals.
