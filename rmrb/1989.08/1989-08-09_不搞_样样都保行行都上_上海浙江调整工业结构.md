"Developing the economy by protecting everything and developing every industry is an outdated path of extensive expansion that cannot continue. We must adjust the industrial structure under the guidance of national industrial policies." This is a consensus among leaders of relevant departments in Shanghai during a discussion on implementing national industrial policies.

The State Planning Commission revealed that Shanghai's "Industrial Structure Adjustment Plan for the Next Two Years" has begun implementation.

The plan, under the premise of ensuring product quality and improving economic efficiency, prioritizes saving energy and raw materials and increasing export earnings as the primary tasks for Shanghai's industrial structure adjustment. It sets a goal of striving to save 8% of energy and raw materials annually.

Following this principle, Shanghai has identified 100 products, including ordinary grinding machines, milling machines, single-cylinder washing machines, and old-style single-door refrigerators, for restriction or elimination. For 82 enterprises with insufficient tasks, poor economic benefits, or unreasonable layouts that conflict sharply with urban environmental protection, measures have been taken to close, merge, or transform them. Meanwhile, 220 products, including color televisions and refrigerator rotary compressors, are prioritized for development. Additionally, 200 construction projects in raw material industries, emerging industries, consumer goods industries, and equipment industries are prioritized to enhance the momentum of industrial development.

Meanwhile, Zhejiang Province has started adjusting its product structure to implement national industrial policies, effectively changing the situation of blind production.

The province's Economic Commission proposed a key industrial product adjustment catalog, dividing products into four categories: essential products that must be protected, products that can leverage resource advantages, restricted products, and prohibited products. Essential products mainly include agricultural support products, necessities for people's lives, fuels, and export products.

To implement national industrial policies, the Economic Commission proposed policy guarantees in eight aspects: plan control, financial credit tilt, leveraging financial and tax supervision, price management, and optimizing investment structure.

    本报讯　“发展经济样样都要保、行行都要上的粗放扩张型老路走不下去了，必须在国家产业政策指导下，抓紧调整工业结构”。这是上海市有关部门领导同志在座谈贯彻落实国家产业政策时比较一致的看法。
    国家计委透露，上海制定的《今明两年工业结构调整方案》已开始实施。
    《方案》以保证产品质量和提高经济效益前提下，把每年节约能源、原材料和增加出口创汇，作为上海工业结构调整的首要任务，并提出了力争实现节约能源、原材料8％的奋斗目标。
    据此原则精神，上海已确定限制或淘汰普通磨床和铣床、单缸洗衣机、老式单门电冰箱等产品100个。对任务不足、经济效益差或布局不合理、与城市环保矛盾尖锐的82家企业，实行了关停并转。与此同时，优先发展彩电、冰箱旋转式压缩机等产品220个；优先安排原材料工业、新兴工业、消费品工业、装备工业等200个建设项目，以增强工业发展后劲。
    又讯　浙江省从调整产品结构入手，实施国家产业政策，有效地改变盲目生产局面。
    该省计经委提出的重点工业产品调整目录，分为重点发展的必保产品、能发挥资源优势的支持产品、限制产品和禁止产品4类。必保的主要包括支农产品、人民生活必需品、燃料、出口产品等。
    为贯彻落实国家产业政策，省计经委从计划调控、金融信贷倾斜、发挥财税监督和杠杆作用、价格管理、优化投资结构等8个方面，提出了政策保证措施。
