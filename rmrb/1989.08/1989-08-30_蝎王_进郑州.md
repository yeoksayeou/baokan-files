The scorpion, one of the "five poisons," is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine when used whole. Jin Zhenxi, the director of the Huaiyang County Scorpion Breeding Experimental Farm in Henan Province, has raised 1.5 million scorpions on his 6-mu (0.1 hectare) residential plot, earning him the title of "Scorpion King" in the region. He is also a recipient of the national "May 1st Labor Medal" and his research on "Scorpion Biology and Kiln-Type Breeding Methods" won the second prize for scientific and technological progress in Henan Province in 1989.

The "Scorpion King" is not content with just breeding scorpions in Huaiyang. Recently, he led 100,000 scorpions into the provincial capital, Zhengzhou, where they are now housed at the Henan Province Biological Toxin Research Institute, of which he is also the director. The research institute is located on the outskirts of Zhengzhou, and a large building there is leased by him. During a visit to Zhengzhou, a reporter interviewed the "Scorpion King" and heard about his "three-step plan":

The first step is to help the scorpions quickly adapt to the water and soil in the Zhengzhou suburbs. The second step is to conduct research on mechanical extraction of scorpion venom. Previously, manual extraction could only handle a few hundred scorpions per hour, which was slow and dangerous. With 1.5 million scorpions, it was impossible to extract venom from all of them, resulting in a lot of wasted venom. If the mechanical extraction experiment is successful, scorpions will automatically release venom as they crawl over the device. This research project is strongly supported by the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission and is being carried out with urgency. The third step is to conduct comprehensive research on the medical use of scorpion venom, which can only be carried out after mechanical venom extraction is realized. The "three-step plan" has already achieved the first step, and the second step is in progress.

The reporter asked the "Scorpion King," "You have successfully raised 1.5 million scorpions in Huaiyang, so why move to Zhengzhou?" He replied, "Zhengzhou is a big city with convenient information flow and many research institutions, which is beneficial for the development of scientific research. The Biological Toxin Research Institute has already hired several senior technical personnel from the Provincial Agricultural Science Academy and other units as consultants to guide the work in their spare time. If we were still in Huaiyang, it would be very inconvenient."

Moreover, Zhengzhou has many restaurants, and scorpions are a famous dish. A dish of vermicelli with a dozen or so fried scorpions is called "Whole Insect Climbing Snow Mountain," and a dish of quail eggs with a dozen or so fried scorpions is called "Black Dragon Playing with Pearls." This is also a business opportunity. It seems that the "Scorpion King" has a bright future in Zhengzhou.

### “蝎王”进郑州

    “蝎王”进郑州
    本报记者　李德民
    “五毒”之一的蝎子，“全虫”是一味宝贵中药。河南省淮阳县养蝎试验场场长金振喜，在自家6分宅基地上养有150万只蝎子，是远近闻名的“蝎王”。他还是全国“五一劳动奖章”获得者，他的“蝎子生物学特性及窑式饲养法”获河南省1989年科技进步二等奖。
    “蝎王”不安于只在淮阳养蝎子，最近他率领10万只蝎子进了省会郑州，养在他兼任所长的河南省生物毒素研究所。研究所在郑州市近郊，一幢大楼是由他出资租赁的。在郑州，记者采访“蝎王”时，听他谈了个“三步走”的计划：
    第一步，使蝎子尽快适应郑州郊区的水土。第二步，进行机械提取蝎毒的科研工作，原来手工提毒一小时只能提两三百只，又慢又危险，150万只蝎子是根本提不完的，大量蝎毒浪费了。如果机械提毒试验成功，蝎子只要爬过那个仪器，就自动排毒。这个科研项目受到河南省科委的大力支持，正在抓紧进行研究。第三步是进行医用蝎毒的综合利用研究，这要在机械的取毒实现之后才能开展。这“三步走”的计划，第一步已经实现，第二步正在进行。
    记者问“蝎王”：“你在淮阳已成功地养了150万只蝎子，为什么往郑州折腾呢？”他说，郑州是大城市，信息灵通，科研机构多，有利于发展科研工作，生物毒素研究所已经聘请了省农科院等单位的几名有高级职称的科技人员当顾问，利用业余时间来指导工作。如果还在淮阳，那就很不方便了。
    再说，郑州的餐馆多，蝎子是一道名菜，一盘粉丝上摆十几只油炸蝎子叫“全虫爬雪山”，一盘鹌鹑蛋上摆十几只油炸蝎子叫“乌龙戏珠”，这也是一笔生意。看来，“蝎王”进郑州，大有可为。
