Some Eastern European countries place great emphasis on the education of youth, striving to improve their ideological and scientific cultural qualities, and to cultivate millions of qualified successors for socialist construction.

Diverse Forms of Patriotic Education
The parties and governments of some Eastern European countries emphasize the education of youth in ideals, moral character, revolutionary traditions, and patriotism. Their methods include utilizing various opportunities and forms, such as commemorative days, lectures, visits to historical sites and exhibitions, collecting cultural relics, investigating local customs, and knowledge competitions, to recall the revolutionary struggles of the older generation, deepen the understanding of the motherland, and arouse students' patriotic enthusiasm and national pride. The Free German Youth and Pioneer organizations in the German Democratic Republic use commemorative days to hold related activities, introducing the lives and deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries and the history of the workers' movement, which are welcomed by young people. Romania, through lectures, travel, visits, and commemorations of major historical events in the country and the party, cultivates in students a love for the country, the party, and the people.

Rich and Colorful Social Practices
Some Eastern European countries generally pay attention to the issue of college and high school students participating in social practices, and regard this activity as an effective way to cultivate the all-around healthy growth of young people, to improve their political and ideological awareness, to cultivate their love for labor and the working people, and to consolidate and improve their professional knowledge, and to cultivate students' ability to solve practical problems with theoretical knowledge. Bulgaria has established student cooperatives in colleges and universities and at all levels of schools nationwide. During holidays, schools organize students to engage in productive labor in urban and rural areas as they are able. In some countries, liberal arts students participate in service labor or go to the countryside to engage in agricultural production; students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine go to factories, farms, and hospitals to engage in technical labor. The Czechoslovakian government has also passed a resolution specifically for the issue of students' social practices, requiring relevant departments nationwide to create conditions for students' social practice activities.

The scope of social practice activities for young students in some Eastern European countries is very wide, with some going to rural areas, factories, and construction sites to work; some using their spare time to engage in information consulting; even restaurants, streets, parks, laboratories, fast-food departments, retail stores, and foreign embassies are places where they participate in labor. Young students participating in productive labor not only receive education but also, because students earn a certain amount of money from labor, reduce the economic burden on their parents.

Organizing Youth to Engage in Scientific and Technological Activities
Some Eastern European countries attach importance to equipping the younger generation with advanced science and technology. These countries have generally established youth science and technology activity stations, set up science and technology creation committees, held "New Talent Week," and carried out activities to encourage being a "Tomorrow's Craftsman," attracting and encouraging a wide range of young people to actively participate in science and technology activities. The science and technology activities of Czechoslovakian youth are thriving, with the number of youth science and technology activity stations nationwide increasing from 300 in 1984 to 1,500 in 1987, with 200,000 participants, accounting for about 12% of the total number of youth in the country; by 1990, the number of science and technology stations nationwide will reach 3,000, with 400,000 participating youth; by 1995, the number will increase to 600,000, accounting for 36% of the total number of youth in the country.

The youth of some Eastern European countries have not let down the party and the state's cultivation, actively engaging in scientific and technological invention activities, and contributing to the country's economic construction. The scientific and technological inventions of Czechoslovakian youth alone brought in 1.5 billion koruna in 1987. In the German Democratic Republic, 1.2 million young people participated in the "Innovator and Inventor" activities, completing 200,000 projects, and achieving 19.2 billion marks in economic benefits. Romanian young students solved more than 12,000 scientific research projects, developed 1,340 products, invented 1,395 new production technologies, and obtained 818 national invention patents. At the same time, the ideological quality of the vast number of young people in some Eastern European countries is continuously improving, with many college and high school students in some countries, after graduation, not fearing hardship, voluntarily going to the grassroots level and to the front lines of production to work.

    东欧一些国家重视青少年教育
    归边
    东欧一些国家重视对青少年的教育，努力提高他们的思想和科学文化素质，为社会主义建设造就千百万合格的后备人材。
    形式多样的爱国主义教育　东欧一些国家党和政府强调对青少年进行理想、思想品德、革命传统和爱国主义的教育。他们的做法是，利用各种场合和多种形式，如纪念日、报告会、参观历史古迹和展览、收集文物资料、调查民风习俗、知识竞赛等，重温革命前辈的斗争历史，增进对祖国的了解，激发学生的爱国热情和民族自豪感。民主德国共青团和少先队组织利用纪念日等举行有关活动，介绍老一辈革命者生平和事迹以及工人运动史，受到青少年的欢迎。罗马尼亚通过讲课、旅行、参观、纪念祖国和党的重大历史事件等，培养学生热爱祖国、党和人民的思想感情。
  丰富多彩的社会实践　东欧一些国家普遍重视大中学生参加社会实践问题，并把这种活动看成是培养青少年全面健康成长的有效途径，以提高青少年的政治思想觉悟，培养他们热爱劳动和劳动人民，并结合所学专业，巩固和提高所学的专业知识，培养学生运用理论知识解决实际问题的能力。保加利亚在高等学校和全国各级学校建立了学生合作社，每逢假期，学校便组织学生到广大城乡参加力所能及的生产劳动。有的国家文科学生参加服务性劳动，或去农村参加农业生产；理、工、农、医专业学生则去工厂、农场、医院从事技术性劳动。捷克斯洛伐克政府还专为学生的社会实践问题通过了决议，要求全国有关部门为学生的社会实践活动创造条件。
    东欧一些国家青年学生参加社会实践活动的范围很广，有的到农村、工厂、建筑工地劳动；有的利用课余时间从事信息咨询；甚至饭店、街道、公园、实验室、快餐部、零售商店以及外国使馆等都是他们参加劳动的地方。青年学生参加生产劳动不仅受到了教育，还由于学生从劳动中得到了一定的报酬，因而减轻了家长的经济负担。
    组织青少年开展科技活动　东欧一些国家重视用先进的科学技术武装青少年一代。这些国家普遍建立了青少年科技活动站，设立科技创造委员会，举办“新人才周”以及开展争当“明天师傅”的活动等，吸引和鼓励广大青少年积极参加科技活动。捷克斯洛伐克青少年的科技活动蓬勃发展，全国青少年科技活动站从1984年的300个发展到1987年的1500个，参加活动的人数已达20万，约占全国青少年总数的12％；到1990年，全国科技站将达到3000个，参加活动的青少年将达到40多万；到1995年，将增加到60万人，占全国青少年总数的36％。
    东欧一些国家青少年没有辜负党和国家的培养，积极投身于科技发明活动，为国家的经济建设作出了贡献。
    捷克斯洛伐克青少年的科技发明收益仅1987年就达到1.5亿克朗。民主德国120万青少年参加“革新能手和发明家”的活动，完成20万个课题，获得19.2亿马克的经济效益。罗马尼亚青年学生解决了12000多个科研课题，开发了1340种产品，发明了1395项生产新技术，获得国家颁发的818项发明专利。同时，东欧一些国家广大青少年的思想素质不断提高，有的国家许多大中学生毕业后不怕艰苦，自愿到基层、到生产第一线去工作。
