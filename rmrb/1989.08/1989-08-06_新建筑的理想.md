Architectural creation requires a cultural atmosphere and economic conditions. In recent years, the reform and opening-up policy has enabled a group of capable architects to emerge, creating some works of cultural value. Although the number of such works is not large, they have brought hope to the architectural community and given people a glimpse of the ideal of new architecture. It is against this backdrop that the Chinese Academy of Arts Contemporary Chinese Architecture Cultural Salon and the Chinese Environmental Art Society, among other institutions, jointly organized the "Selection of Excellent Architectural Art Works of the 1980s in China," inviting nearly 200 experts and scholars from mainland China and Hong Kong to vote and select the top ten excellent architectural art works in mainland China during the 1980s. Among the winning works, the China International Exhibition Center designed by Cai Peiyi of the Beijing Municipal Institute of Architectural Design topped the list.

The China International Exhibition Center showcases a successful exploration of Chinese modern architectural culture, marking an exciting breakthrough. Its massive spatial scale not only gives a sense of vibrancy and uniqueness but also meets the increasingly complex and diverse functional requirements of modern comprehensive exhibition buildings. The nearly 300-meter-long building is divided into four sections, with the repetition of simple geometric shapes, and the facade design of "hollow below and solid above" showcases a sculptural effect of light and shadow, fully demonstrating the aesthetic value of architecture. Utilizing steel structures, lightweight roofs, and other architectural technologies, it reveals the grand style of modern architectural expression. The corners of the exhibition hall units are recessed and embedded with transparent glass pyramids, creating a lively rhythm. The entrance of the exhibition hall is the most outstanding part of the building. The design concept is: the arch and the architrave's arc form a strong contrast with the repeated square motifs of the building, becoming a unique symbol of the entrance.

However, many modern buildings in China are still unsatisfactory. Some modern buildings are mediocre and lack distinct features; others are dressed in pseudo-antique costumes, rigidly imitated, lacking vitality and creativity. The path of modern Chinese architecture remains a puzzling issue. Architectural philosophy is the soul of architectural creation. Famous buildings around the world are imbued with philosophical thoughts, possessing profound cultural value. For example, Wright's works embody the individuality of organic architecture, illustrating the growth of the world; Le Corbusier's works reflect the "house as a machine for living" aesthetic; Nervi's Rome Sports Palace demonstrates the power and skill of sports architecture. These are all worth our study and reflection.

    新建筑的理想
    王明贤
    建筑创作需要文化氛围与经济条件。这几年改革开放的形势，促使一批有作为的建筑师崭露头角，创造出一些有文化价值的作品。这些作品数量虽然不多，但给建筑界带来了希望，使人们看到了新建筑的理想。正是在这样的背景下，中国艺术研究院中国当代建筑文化沙龙、中国环境艺术学会等单位联合举办了“中国80年代建筑艺术优秀作品评选”，邀请大陆与香港近200名专家学者投票，评出了中国（大陆）80年代十项优秀建筑艺术作品。在获奖作品中，北京市建筑设计院柴裴义设计的中国国际展览中心名列榜首。
    中国国际展览中心显示了中国现代建筑文化的成功探索，是令人兴奋的突破。它那建筑物的巨大空间尺度，既给人蓬勃向上、新颖独特之感，又满足了现代综合展览建筑功能日趋复杂多样化的要求。近300米的大长条一分为四，简洁的几何形体的重复，下虚上实的立面构图，表现了雕塑感的光影效果，使建筑美学价值得到充分的展示；利用钢结构、轻质屋面等建筑科技成果，透露出现代建筑表现形式的大手笔；展馆单元体四角凹进，并以透明的玻璃棱锥体嵌入，节奏明快。展馆的入口是该建筑最精彩的部分。创作构思为：拱廊与额枋的弧形与建筑物的多次重复的方形母题适成强烈的对比，成为入口的独特标志。
    但是，中国不少现代建筑尚不如人意。有些现代建筑平庸，毫无特色；有些建筑则披上仿古外衣，生搬硬套，缺乏生命力和创造力。中国现代建筑的道路，仍是一个困扰人心的问题。建筑哲学是建筑创作的灵魂。世界上著名的建筑都渗透了一种哲学思想，具有深刻的文化价值。如莱特的作品，表现了有机建筑的个性，以此说明了世界的生长；勒·柯布西埃的作品则体现出“房屋是住人的机器”这一机器美学；奈维的罗马小体育宫则显示了体育建筑的力量和技巧。这都值得我们借鉴、思索。
