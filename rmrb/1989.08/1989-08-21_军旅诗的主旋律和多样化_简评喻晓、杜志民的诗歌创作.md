The Main Melody and Diversity of Military Poetry
— A Brief Evaluation of Yu Xiao and Du Zhimin's Poetry

Military poetry, along with the entire body of military literature, should have a "main melody." The answer is affirmative. Just as a solemn main melody must be played through multi-layered and multi-voiced concertos and symphonies, the realization of the main melody of revolutionary military literature, including military poetry, must rely on the pursuit of different artistic personalities by each military poet.

Yu Xiao and Du Zhimin, as middle-aged military poets, have been cultivating the field of military poetry for many years. They were both non-literature majors during the Cultural Revolution, and their military careers have nourished their literary pursuits. Under the main melody and grand themes of revolutionary heroism and patriotism, they have written distinct military poems. In the constellation of military poets in the new era, they have found their own positions.

Regarding their early works, most of them are difficult to trace. However, I believe they must have written some "rifle poems" or similar works. At the beginning of breaking free from the constraints and influences of the extreme leftist literary trends, the starting points of military poets were roughly the same, all more or less having a narrow understanding of the so-called "main melody." The rich and colorful military life and the profound and complex souls of soldiers were often filtered and purified into dry political ideologies and doctrines. With the steps of ideological liberation and the impact of the "poetry revolution" tide, military poets' understanding of expressing the main melody in poetry has deepened significantly, and their horizons have been greatly expanded. Their artistic personalities have also been more fully expressed. Military life has never been portrayed as vividly and colorfully. Military poetry, with its strong foundation, has always stood out in the tumultuous poetic tide of the new era. Only in this broader context can we perhaps more accurately understand and grasp the creative achievements and contributions of these two poets.

Yu Xiao's poetry is a soldier's "love song to spring." Or one could say, he creates a unique charm of revolutionary heroism and patriotism that is clear and enduring. In his poetry collection *Youth and the Sea*, he has expressed a unique style: "No shadows. Everything is exposed, sunlight and wind sculpt transparent thoughts. No fatigue. Always overflowing with passion, regardless of the season, there are flowers that never wilt." This is somewhat related to his experience as an engineer. He leaves his poetic sentiments on the beaches and deserts, carves them into the cliffs and mountains, records them on the land of the motherland, and marks "a soldier's journey inch by inch." His poetry has a touch of wandering and roaming. On one hand, a soldier's life is hard and lonely, like "a nameless wild grass in the mountains"; on the other hand, the flowers, snow, and romantic poetry and paintings of the south and the wild pigeons of the north are full of romantic poetic charm. Thus, a soldier's love for the motherland finds a solid foundation in hard and ordinary labor, and further "finds the index of military life," making it not seem light and shallow. In such a bright and uplifting tone, it is natural to express a unique perspective on life and death: "As a soldier, sacrifice is glorious, but it is not the only honor. A true hero must live better, happier, and freer than all the strong enemies, enjoy enough happiness and love, use a bamboo flute stained with blood and tears to sing a beautiful life!" (From "Love's Requiem") Yu Xiao's many short poems based on the lives of border and coastal defense troops are full of such youthful beauty and vitality. He expresses the political passion of the green military uniform very fully: the trial of the "Gang of Four" by Justice Road No. 1, the tragic and deep remembrance of martyr Zhang Zixin; the motherland's "Dawn Song," the call for reform and opening up in "China's Call"; the thief who repents in the morning, the former Prime Minister Palme who fell in the street; the reclining Buddha of Xishan, the Three Visits Hall of Longzhong; the cadre's file bag, the legendary magic pen... all can inspire his poetic sentiments. These short poems are ingeniously conceived, emotionally sincere, and have a unique charm, with the clear and magnificent beauty of military life as the main theme.

In contrast, Du Zhimin's poetry is more rugged and robust, or one could say he expresses a rugged and heroic style of revolutionary heroism and patriotism. Du Zhimin pays more attention to the overall landscape and grand style of large-scale military operations. *Flowers on the Battlefield* is a poetry collection published by Du Zhimin in his early years, with most of the poems set against the background of modern military exercises or as the objects of lyrical expression, focusing on the shaping of the contemporary soldier's spirit and soul, and standing out in the military poetry field. In 1986, Du Zhimin, as a military reporter, stayed on the front lines of the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam in Laoshan for several months. The experience of war life and the witnessing of bloodshed and death made his poetry transition from "imaginary war" to "real war." He uses "Laoshan Documentary Poetry" to refer to the war poems he wrote on the front lines and after returning from the front lines. The most heart-rending poems in these are the lyrical protagonist's spiritual baptism as a soldier and the unadorned self-dissection of the soul—on the sharp stone road, in the "three transformations," in the valley of death, he is ashamed and repents for "an unconscious avoidance action" and "a pitiful hope that sprouted in the subconscious," "so, to this day, I dare not boast, I dare not call myself a Laoshan person." For poetry with the title "documentary," it probably implies the poet's dissatisfaction with false war songs. He has written about orchids and orchid flowers in his poems, not ignoring the deep heroic significance hidden within their "ordinariness." In his poems, there are no god-like, flawless heroes. He even uses titles like *Incomplete* and *Desire*. He points out that the important thing is that soldiers, when facing sacrifice, should take "a great offensive posture." He enthusiastically praises a real, vibrant heroism—"People have always been like this, perfection is not as good as completeness, incompleteness is the usual way of human existence, heroes belong to a time and space, what is most worthy of praise is that you, with your flaws, bid us farewell... Soldiers, because of their fearlessness of death, become eternal songs and poems in the universe, become another kind of person!" Such a simple heroism allows the poet to face bloodshed and death with a stern and sober attitude, thus generating a powerful "endurance of pain." Poems like *Malipo Cemetery* and *The Death of a Soldier* focus on the positive connotations of the purification of the soul and spiritual world brought by death and sacrifice, rather than concentrating more ink on the sad sighs and lamentations of the passing of life, leading to weak and powerless "humanitarian, humanistic" crying. For those soldiers who walked along the Nanwen River and never returned, what is implied is a deeper and more profound longing and remembrance, and further praises the army as a whole of heroism, its unending and everlasting mighty power. It is worth noting that Du Zhimin observes and describes war as a "complete world," history, reality; men, women; front lines, rear areas; China, foreign countries; war, peace... In addition to praising the front-line soldiers, he also casts a critical "worry" on Laoshan becoming a tourist hotspot; while describing the hardships of the battlefield, he also sketches the leisurely life on the battlefield. Once war becomes a persuasive, philosophical whole, poetry also transcends superficial utilitarianism and gains a deeper meaning.

Obviously, Yu Xiao and Du Zhimin are not the entirety of military poetry in the new era. Due to space limitations, it is not possible to list all their shortcomings and inadequacies here, but their explorations and achievements have somewhat indicated the level and reality of current military poetry. With the progress of military modernization, there will be more and better military poetry emerging, and the "main melody" will become increasingly resounding and powerful. This is probably beyond doubt.

    军旅诗的主旋律和多样化
    ——简评喻晓、杜志民的诗歌创作
    黄国柱
    军旅诗以及整个军事文学要不要有一个“主旋律”？答案应是肯定的。但正如庄严的主旋律必须由多层次多声部的协奏和交响才能奏出一样，革命的军事文学包括军旅诗的主旋律的实现，必须有赖于每个军旅诗人不同艺术个性的追求。
    喻晓和杜志民作为中年的军队诗人，已经在军旅诗的园地里耕耘多年。他们都是“文革”前非文学专业的大学生，军旅生涯的沃土，滋养了他们的文学之树。在革命英雄主义、爱国主义的主旋律和大标题下，他们写出了迥然不同的军旅诗章。在新时期群星闪烁的军旅诗人的群体里，他们找到了自己的位置。
    关于他们早年的诗作，大多已经无从查考。不过，我相信他们大概一定写过“枪杆诗”一类的习作。军旅诗在摆脱极左文艺思潮禁锢和影响之初，军队诗人们的起点大致相同，即都或多或少地对所谓“主旋律”存在一些较为褊狭的理解。丰富多彩的军旅生活和深邃复杂的军人的心灵往往被过滤和净化为干巴巴的政治的理念、信条，随着思想解放的步伐、“诗界革命”潮流的冲击，军队诗人对诗歌表现主旋律的理解大大地深化，视野也随之广为拓展，艺术个性也得到较为充分的张扬。军旅生活从未被表现得如此色彩缤纷，五光十色。军旅诗以其雄厚的实力，在新时期风云变幻的诗大潮中始终独树一帜。只有在这个大的背景中，我们或许可以较为准确地理解和把握这两位诗人的创作实绩及贡献。
    喻晓的诗，是一个士兵“唱给春天的恋歌”。或者可以说，他创造的是一种清丽、隽永的革命英雄主义、爱国主义的情趣。在《青春与海》这本诗集里，他表明了一种独特的格调：“没有阴影。／一切裸露着，／阳光和风／雕塑透明的思想。／没有倦怠。／总是洋溢着激情，／不论哪个季节，／都有开不败的花朵。”这多少和他的工程兵的经历有关系。他把诗情遗落在沙滩戈壁，雕刻在山崖峻岭，记录在祖国大地，标下“一寸寸军人的旅程”。他的诗多少带有行吟和云游的色彩，一方面，军人的生活是艰苦而孤寂的，像“山间一蓬无名的野草”；另一方面，其风花雪月，南方的情人湖，北方的野鸽子，又充满着浪漫的诗情画意。于是，军人的祖国之爱在艰苦而平凡的劳作中便有了坚实的依托，进而“找到军旅生活的索引”，使之不至于显得轻飘和肤浅。在这样的明朗和昂扬的基调中，自然会升发出这样的独具个性的军人的生死观：“作为军人，／牺牲是壮烈的，／但绝不是唯一的光荣。／一个真正的勇士，／要比一切强悍的敌人，／活得更美好，更快活，更自在，／享受足够的幸福和爱，／用滴过血泪的斑竹做成洞箫，／歌唱美丽的人生！”（《爱的安魂曲》）喻晓的大量的以边海防部队生活为题材的短诗大多洋溢着这样一种青春的美感和活力。他把绿色的军衣所包孕的火一般的政治热情表达得很充分：正义路一号对“四人帮”的审判，对于张志新烈士的悲壮而深沉的怀念；祖国的《黎明之曲》，改革开放的《中国的呼唤》；早晨忏悔的小偷，倒在街头的帕尔梅首相；西山的卧佛，隆中的三顾堂；干部的档案袋，传说中的神笔……都可以引发他的诗情。这些短诗，构思精巧，感情真挚，意境隽永，以军旅生活的清丽壮美为主要的意境。
    相比之下，杜志民的诗则更具一些军人粗放的质感，或者可以说他表达的是一种粗砺雄健的革命英雄主义爱国主义风韵。杜志民较注重军队大规模军事行动的整体景观和宏大气势的描摹。《阵地上的小花》是杜志民前几年出版的诗集，其中的诗作大多以现代化的军事演习作为背景或抒写的对象，重在对当代军人气质灵魂的塑造，在军旅诗坛上别具一格。1986年杜志民作为一名军事记者驻老山对越自卫作战前线达数月之久。战争生活的亲历，流血和死亡的目睹，从而使他的诗从“假想的战争”跨入了“真实的战争”。他用“老山纪实诗”来统称他在前线以及前线归来之后所写的战争诗。这些诗里最能撼动人心的，是抒情主人公作为军人所经受的灵魂的洗礼，以及不加掩饰的心灵的自我解剖——在尖石路上，在“三转变”，在死亡谷里，他为自己“一个下意识躲避动作”，“一个潜意识里萌生的可怜期冀”而羞愧，忏悔，“所以，至今／我不敢吹牛／不敢以老山人自诩”。对于诗而冠之以“纪实”，大概隐含了诗人对虚假的战争颂歌的不满。他不止一次地在诗里写到了兰草，兰花，不因其“普通而又普通”，而忽视其中蕴藏很深的英雄主义的象征意味。在他的诗里，没有神一般的、尽善尽美的英雄，他甚至用《残缺》、《欲望》来做诗的标题。他指出，重要的在于，军人面对牺牲，要采取“一种伟大的主攻态势”，他热情歌颂的是一种实实在在、生气勃勃的活着的英雄主义——“人向来如是／完美不能正如尽善不能／残缺是人类惯常的存在方式／英雄只属于一个时空／最值得颂扬的是／你带着缺撼作别了我们……军人因对死亡无畏／而成为宇宙间永恒的歌与诗／成为另一种人”！这样一种质朴的英雄观，使诗人有可能用一种严峻而清醒的态度去面对流血和死亡，进而产生了强大的“承受痛苦的力量”。《麻栗坡陵园》《军人之死》等等，重在抒写死亡和牺牲所带来的净化心灵和精神世界的积极思蕴，而不是把笔墨更多地集中在生命消逝的悲哀的叹息惋惜，以至软弱无力的
  “人道主义、人性”的哭泣。对于那些沿着南温河走去，再也没有回来的士兵，所寓寄的是淡中见浓的更深沉的思恋和怀念，进而颂赞了我们的军队作为英雄主义的整体，其前赴后继、生生不息的无穷的伟力。值得着重指出的是，杜志民是把战争作为“完整的世界”来观照和描述的，历史，现实；男人，女人；前方，后方；中国，外国；战争，和平……在对前线将士盛赞之余，也对老山成为旅游热点而投以批评的“忧怨”；在抒写战地艰苦的同时，也有战地业余生活情趣的素描。一旦战争成为一个雄辩的哲理化了的整体，诗也就越超了表层的功利，获得了更深邃的意境。
    显然，喻晓和杜志民不是新时期军旅诗的全部，限于篇幅，这里甚至不能一一列举他们的缺欠和不足，但他们的探索及其成就却多少表明了当前军旅诗所达到的水平和现实状况。随着军队现代化的进程，将会有更多更好的军旅诗涌现，“主旋律”将越来越嘹亮、浑雄，这大概是勿庸置疑的。
