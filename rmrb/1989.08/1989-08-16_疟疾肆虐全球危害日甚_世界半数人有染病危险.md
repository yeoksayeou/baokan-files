The World Health Organization has warned that nearly half of the world's population is at risk of contracting malaria, and the disease is spreading severely in many regions.

The World Health Organization's _Weekly Epidemiological Record_ recently reported that 100 countries worldwide have 100 million new malaria cases each year, with an additional 264 million people at risk of contracting the disease from malaria-carrying mosquitoes. In Africa, it is estimated that there are 88 million cases annually. In Central and South America, the number of malaria cases has increased from 270,000 in 1974 to over 1 million in 1987, with half of these cases occurring in Brazil. Some regions in Latin America that had previously eradicated malaria are now seeing new cases emerge.

The report states that due to the increasing resistance of malaria parasites to traditional drugs such as quinine and chloroquine, and the growing resistance of malaria-carrying mosquitoes to indoor insecticides, coupled with a lack of preventive measures, malaria is rampant in some countries and regions.

    疟疾肆虐全球危害日甚  世界半数人有染病危险
    新华社北京8月16日电  世界卫生组织警告说，全世界近一半人有患疟疾的危险，这种疾病已在许多地区严重蔓延。
    世界卫生组织《流行病记录周报》最近报道，全球100个国家每年有1亿疟疾病新患者，还有2.64亿人可能会受疟蚊感染而患病。在非洲，估计每年的发病率达8800万。在中美和南美，疟疾患者由1974年的27万增加到1987年的100多万，其中一半患者是巴西人。拉丁美洲一些原来已经消灭了疟疾的地区，现在又不断发现新病例。
    报道说，由于疟原虫对喹啉、奎宁等传统的药物越来越具有抗药性，此外传染疟疾的疟蚊对于在室内喷洒的杀虫剂药物也产生抗御性，再加之缺少预防措施，致使疟疾病在一些国家和地区肆虐。
