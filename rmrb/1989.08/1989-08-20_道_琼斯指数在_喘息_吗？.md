Title: Is the Dow Jones Index "Pausing"?

Recently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been fluctuating, unable to surpass the historical high of 2722.42 points set on August 25, 1987. A prominent stock market analyst in the United States has vividly described the situation, saying that the Dow Jones Index is like a ladder; when you climb too high too fast, it's best to stop and catch your breath, checking if the next step is secure. This indicates that while the current New York stock market outlook is positive, people are still wary of the stock market crash that followed the rapid rise two years ago.

From a phenomenological perspective, the current New York stock market conditions are quite similar to those two years ago. In early August, the Dow Jones Index rose steadily, reaching 2712.63 points on the 10th, just 9.79 points shy of the historical peak. Afterward, it retreated, dropping to 2679.63 points on the 17th. However, overall market trading has been very active.

The main factors contributing to the New York stock market's strong "bullish" trend two years later are: the sustained slow growth of the U.S. economy, reduced inflationary pressure, and a slight decrease in interest rates; increased corporate profits, making stock investments profitable; foreign investors buying more U.S. stocks; and a wave of mergers and acquisitions driving up stock prices. However, as the Dow Jones Index approaches its highest point, the question of whether the "Black Monday" of October 19, 1987, will repeat itself has become a hot topic among experts.

Most people here believe that the stock market will not repeat the events of 1987. This is because the current market factors and overall economic climate are somewhat different from two years ago. In terms of market factors, stocks were overvalued back then, while now they are basically reasonable. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has implemented new supervisory and preventive regulations, such as halting trading or prohibiting computer program trading when the Dow Jones Index drops by a certain margin. The overall economic climate is also different from before. In mid-1987, the U.S. economy was overheating, interest rates were rising, the dollar was depreciating, and trade and government fiscal deficits were high. The current situation seems to be the opposite or at least different. Furthermore, the economic relations between the United States and its major allies are more harmonious now than before the 1987 stock market crash, with fewer frictions in trade, interest rates, and exchange rates. Based on this, they estimate that the Dow Jones Index breaking its historical high is just a matter of time. Many of them also predict that the Dow Jones Index could break the 3000-point mark by late this year or early next year.

However, a few people are concerned about the stock market's upward trend, believing that the possibility of another stock market crash cannot be ruled out. Their reasoning is that the economic outlook is unclear; computer program trading still accounts for a significant portion; the "merger fever" artificially inflates stock prices; many small investors are still cautious; and the biggest danger is that if a large amount of funds suddenly flow into the stock market, stock prices will soar. Historical patterns show that after a rapid rise, a crash often follows.

Both analyses seem to have some merit, but the stock market is ever-changing, and it's hard for anyone to make an accurate prediction. However, one thing is certain: the ups and downs of the New York stock market will ultimately depend on whether the nearly 82-month economic growth will "soft land" or "hard land." This is probably the reason why the Dow Jones Index is currently "pausing."

    道·琼斯指数在“喘息”吗？
    本报记者　张亮
    近日来，道·琼斯工业股票指数时起时落，迟迟未能逾越1987年8月25日所创的2722.42点的历史最高纪录。对于投资者的这种心态，美国一位颇有影响的股市分析家形象地说，道·琼斯指数好比一架梯子，当你爬得太高太快时，最好还是停下来喘口气，看看前面的梯级是否牢固。这说明，目前纽约股市行情虽然看好，但人们对两年前的股票先暴涨而后出现暴跌狂潮仍然心有余悸。
    从现象看，目前纽约股市行情与两年前颇为相似。8月上旬，道·琼斯指数节节爬升，10日曾达到2712.63点，仅比历史最高峰差9.79点，此后，转而退缩不前，17日跌至2679.63点。但是，整个市场交易很活跃。
    纽约股市两年后又呈强劲“牛市”的主要因素是：美国经济持续缓慢增长，对通货膨胀的压力减轻，利率有所下降；公司利润增加，股票投资因而有利可图；外国投资者增购美国股票；兼并风潮迭起，股票价格随之上扬。然而，在道·琼斯指数向最高点逼近之际，1987年10月19日震惊世界的“黑色星期一”是否会重演自然成了专家们纷纷议论的热门话题。
    此间多数人认为股市不会重蹈1987年的覆辙。因为当前的市场因素及总的经济气候与两年前不大相同。就市场因素而言，当年股票过分超值，而现在基本趋于合理。其次，美国证券交易委员会已经规定了一些新的监督和防范条例，如道·琼斯指数下跌一定幅度时就马上停止交易或禁止使用电脑程序。当时总的经济气候也不同于现在。1987年年中美国经济增长“过热”，利率攀升，美元贬值，外贸和政府财政赤字居高难下，而目前的情况似乎恰恰相反或至少有所不同。另外，美国与其主要盟国的经济关系较1987年股票暴跌前协调和谐，在贸易、利率和汇率问题上的摩擦现时并不突出。他们据此估计，道·琼斯指数突破历史最高纪录“只是个时间问题”。其中许多人还预测，道·琼斯指数在今年晚些时候或明年初有可能突破3000点大关。
    但是，也有少数人对股票涨势表示担忧，认为股票再度暴跌的可能性不能排除。其理由是，经济走向不明朗；电脑程序交易目前仍占很大比例，“兼并热”会人为地抬高股票价格；许多小本投资者目前仍持观望态度；最大的危险是，如果人们把大量资金突然投向股票市场，股票价格就会扶摇直上。而以往的规律是，暴涨之后接着就是暴跌。
    上述两种分析似乎都有一定道理，但是股票市场千变万化，恐怕谁也难于作出准确预测。不过，有一点是肯定的，即纽约股市行情的涨落从根本上说将取决于已持续了近82个月的经济增长将会“软着陆”还是“硬着陆”。这恐怕也正是道·琼斯指数眼下“喘息”之缘故。
