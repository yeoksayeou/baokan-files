Too Much of an Outrage

Xinhua News Agency reporter Liú Ruìcháng

On August 15th, the U.S. armed forces in the center of Panama City used seven helicopters to conduct a military exercise supposedly to "protect" the security of the U.S. embassy in Panama. A country's military, without the host country's permission, openly brandishing weapons in the capital of another sovereign nation, is not only unprecedented in Panama's history but is also rare in the world.

The small country of Panama, with a population of 2 million, has never touched a single blade of grass or tree in the U.S. Why has it suffered such misfortune? On the surface, it appears that the U.S. dislikes Panama's powerful figure Noriega and wants to replace him. In reality, the U.S. is forcing its will on another country, maintaining its so-called "strategic significance."

In 1903, the U.S. used an unequal treaty to obtain the right to build and permanently use the Panama Canal. Later, it moved the headquarters of the Southern Command, which oversees all military operations in Latin America, to Panama, establishing 14 military bases and stationing more than 10,000 troops. Panama, after a long struggle to regain sovereignty over the canal, signed a new canal treaty with the U.S. in September 1977, stipulating that the U.S. would hand over all canal sovereignty and withdraw all troops by December 31, 1999. However, the U.S. then attempted to modify this treaty to retain military bases in the canal zone after the year 2000, but this was rejected by Noriega. Since mid-1987, the U.S. has used internal conflicts in Panama to interfere in its domestic affairs, launching an anti-Noriega movement, imposing economic sanctions on Panama, and increasing troops in the canal zone to apply pressure.

The U.S. has hidden the real issue of the canal dispute in its attempt to oust Noriega, presenting two seemingly noble reasons: Noriega's undemocratic politics and his involvement in drug trafficking. Regardless, Noriega's problems should be solved by the Panamanian people. This is an internal matter for Panama and does not require U.S. intervention.

The U.S. is practicing hegemony over a small country, which is truly too much of an outrage. This not only further ignites the patriotic fervor of the Panamanian people to defend their national sovereignty and national dignity but also arouses the indignation of many Latin American countries. Panama belongs to the Panamanian people. As the late General Torrijos said, it is not a U.S. colony, nor does it wish to be a "federal state" of the U.S., and it certainly does not want to add another star to the American flag.

    欺人太甚
    新华社记者　刘瑞常
    美国武装部队15日在巴拿马首都市中心，动用7架直升机，举行所谓“保卫”美国驻巴拿马大使馆“安全”的军事演习。一国军队未经驻在国同意，公然在另一个主权国家首都舞刀弄枪，不仅在巴拿马历史上没有前例，就是在世界上恐怕亦属罕见。
    200万人口的弹丸小国巴拿马从未触动过美国一草一木，为何遭此厄运？表面上看起来是美国不喜欢巴拿马实权人物诺列加，要换马，实则是美国硬把自己的意志强加于他国，维护它的所谓“战略意义”。
    1903年，美国通过不平等条约，取得了修建和永久使用巴拿马运河的权利，后来又把统辖整个拉美军事行动的南方司令部搬到这里，建立了14个军事基地，常驻军队1万余人。巴拿马为收回运河主权经过长期斗争，于1977年9月与美国签署了新运河条约，规定美国于1999年12月31日交还全部运河主权并撤走全部驻军。但是，美国随后又企图修改这一条约，以便2000年后仍在运河区保留军事基地，但遭到诺列加的拒绝。从1987年中开始，美国利用巴拿马国内矛盾干涉巴内政，掀起倒诺运动，又是对巴经济制裁，又是增兵运河区施加压力。
    美国倒诺，隐去运河之争这一实质问题，摆出两条冠冕堂皇的理由：诺列加政治不民主和参与贩毒。不管怎样，诺列加的问题应由巴拿马人来解决，这是巴拿马内政问题，无需美国劳神。
    美国对一个小国推行强权政治，实在欺人太甚。这不但进一步激发了巴拿马人民维护国家主权和民族尊严的爱国热情，而且引起广大拉美国家的义愤。巴拿马是属于巴拿马人民的。正如已故托里霍斯将军所说，它不是美国的殖民地，也不愿作美国“联邦州”，更不愿为星条旗再增加一颗星。（据新华社北京16日电）
