The villagers of Liuzhuang are now more unfamiliar with the old farm tool warehouse to the west of the village than outsiders are.

Not long ago, someone from a neighboring village across the river came to borrow a three-legged plow, and only then did the dust-covered plows, seeders, harrows, and wooden wheelbarrows in the shed wake up from their long slumber.

It's as if they've said, "Swords to plowshares, horses to the south of the mountains"! Over a hundred sturdy mules in the livestock farm have become idle, only good for manure and breeding.

The new agricultural machinery yard looks spacious. The combine harvesters, which have just finished harvesting the new wheat, stand proudly under the scorching sun, their massive bodies brimming with excess energy. Accompanying them is a complete set of equipment for plowing, sowing, harvesting, transporting, and threshing into storage. Liuzhuang's 1,800 mu of high-yield, stable-yield grain and cotton fields are tended by just 41 people, accounting for 6% of the village's labor force.

The remaining 94%? Apart from paper-making, chemical, mechanical, construction, and commercial enterprises, the elite have joined the village-run Huaxing Pharmaceutical Factory. This factory, with an average worker age of just over 20, has an annual output value of 30 million yuan, making it the largest producer of inosinate in the country, with output accounting for over 50% of the national total. It saves the country over 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange for imported inosinate, and the labor productivity per capita ranks first in the province's industry. Additionally, another factory producing kanamycin, with an output value equivalent to two Huaxing Pharmaceutical Factories, will soon be put into production.

Last year, Liuzhuang's total output value was 42 million yuan, with per capita distribution of 2,000 yuan and per household savings of 25,000 yuan. Compared to 1949, the population has doubled, per capita income has increased 100-fold, and the total output value has increased 1,000-fold.

The 58-year-old "farmer representative" Shi Laihe says that these 40 years have been lived without regret. He serves as the party branch secretary of Liuzhuang and the director of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial cooperative, leading Liuzhuang to common prosperity and becoming today's "richest in central China," a stable national advanced rural model for 30 years. Since 1978, he has served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh National People's Congress, representing the wishes of Chinese farmers and solemnly raising his sturdy hand...

History is piled up in the western warehouse. Future generations will no longer recognize those plows and seeders, but the people of Liuzhuang still do not bear to discard them, to remind the world: the socialist path is not wrong!

    “中原首富”
    ——新乡县刘庄小记
    对村西那个废旧农具仓库，如今刘庄人比外村人还陌生了。
    前不久，隔河邻村有人来借三脚耧耩地，才惊醒了满棚尘封已久的犁、耧、耙和木轮手推车。
    真是个“刀枪入库，马放南山”！畜牧场里100多匹肥壮骡马，闲作了只配积肥、繁殖的花花公子。
    新的农机大院显得宽阔。刚刚收罢新麦的一台台“康拜因”，在骄阳下耸立着精力过剩的庞大身躯。陪伴它们的，是耕、种、收、运和脱粒入仓的一整套设备……实现了机械化、水利化、良种化，刘庄1800亩粮棉高产稳产田，仅由41人耕作，占全村劳力的6％。
    另外94％呢？除造纸、化工、机械、建筑、商业等之外，精锐部分进了村办华星药厂。这个厂，职工平均年龄仅20多岁，年产值3000万元，是目前全国生产肌苷的最大厂家，产量占全国50％以上，为国家节省进口肌苷外汇1000多万美元，全员劳动生产率居全省同行业第一。此外，另一座产值相当于两个华星药厂的卡那霉素分厂，不久也将投产。
    去年，刘庄总产值4200万元，人均分配2000元，户均存款2.5万元。与1949年相比，人口增1倍，人均收入增100倍，总产值增1000倍。
    58岁的“农民议员”史来贺说，这40年活得无愧无悔。他兼任刘庄党支书记和农工商联合社社长，使刘庄共同富裕而成为当今“中原首富”，成为30年稳固的全国农村先进典型。1978年以来，他历任全国人大第五、六、七届常委，代表中国农民的意愿，神圣地举起了他那粗大的手……
    历史，堆积在村西仓库里了。后代将不再认识那些犁耧，但刘庄人仍不忍毁弃，为的是警示这个世界：走社会主义的道路不错！
