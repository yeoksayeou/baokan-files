Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, August 6th.

In the dialogue regarding how to resolve the current political crisis in Panama among the three sides, the Panamanian opposition has proposed holding a public referendum, while the government insists on forming a temporary government and holding new elections according to the suggestions of the Organization of American States. The dialogue has yet to make any progress.

In the three-way talks convened by the Organization of American States on August 4th between the government, military, and opposition, the opposition believed that the government's proposal to form a temporary government and hold new elections was "undemocratic." They demanded that a public referendum be held on August 20th to vote on issues such as forming a temporary government, the resignation of Noriega, and recognizing the results of the May 7th elections. The ruling party, however, argued that under the current circumstances, with the hostile presence of U.S. troops in Panama, neither a public referendum nor elections could be conducted.

The head of the Organization of American States mission, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Cordovez, said in a television interview that the issue of Noriega's departure was not avoided in the dialogue. Both Noriega's supporters and opponents considered it a problem that needed to be clearly addressed.

Cordovez also stated that if the Organization of American States' mediation fails and no political agreement is reached in the dialogue, the United States will take a "hardline" stance against the Panamanian government.

The opposition said that since the two vice-presidential candidates of the Democratic Opposition Alliance were scheduled to visit Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru on August 5th, the dialogue could not continue.

    巴拿马三方意见相左  对话仍然未取得进展
    本报加拉加斯8月6日电  记者朱满庭报道：在有关如何解决当前政治危机的巴拿马三方对话中，巴拿马反对派提出要求举行公民投票，而政府方面则坚持按照美洲国家组织的建议组成一个临时政府并重新进行选举。对话仍未取得进展。
    在4日由美洲国家组织召集的政府、军方和反对派的三方对话中反对派方面认为政府方面主张的成立临时政府和重新选举的方法是“反民主的”，而要求在8月20日举行一次公民投票，就成立临时政府、诺列加去职和承认5月7日选举结果等问题进行表决。而执政党方面则认为在目前美国驻巴拿马军队充满敌意的情况下，无论公民投票或选举都无法进行。
    美洲国家组织使团团长，厄瓜多尔外长科尔多维兹则在接受电视采访时说，对话中，没有回避诺列加的去留问题。无论诺列加的朋友还是他的反对者都认为这是一个应该加以明确的问题。
    科尔多维兹还说，如果美洲国家组织的斡旋失败，对话中不能取得一项政治协议，美国将对巴拿马政府采取“强硬”立场。
    反对派方面说，由于公民主义反对派民主联盟的两位副总统候选人5日要到委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚和秘鲁进行访问，对话已无法继续进行。
