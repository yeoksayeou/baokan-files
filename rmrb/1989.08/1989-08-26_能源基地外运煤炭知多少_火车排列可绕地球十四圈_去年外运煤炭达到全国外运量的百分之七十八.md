In recent years, the people of Shanxi have been working tirelessly to build the Datong II Power Plant, the Shenhua Power Plant, and the 500,000-volt ultra-high-voltage power transmission line from Shenhua to Datong to Beijing. Despite the fact that Shanxi's electricity supply is also tight, the people of Shanxi have put the overall situation first and have been exporting 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, making Shanxi the province with the highest electricity exports in the country.

The People's Daily reports: Shanxi Province, which has been designated by the state as an energy and heavy chemical industry base, has exported a total of 1.852 billion tons of coal since the founding of the People's Republic, including 50.15 million tons for export. Domestically, it has supported 26 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and 8 separately planned cities. Internationally, it has been sold to 23 countries and regions. If the exported coal is loaded onto trains, one car after another, it could circle the Earth 14 times.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, Shanxi's coal industry has achieved remarkable achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. From 1950 to 1988, the state invested a total of 13.073 billion yuan in the basic construction of Shanxi's coal mines, building 8 mining areas including Datong, Yangquan, Xishan, Jincheng, Lu'an, Fenxi, Xuangang, and Huo County. At the same time, more than 400 local coal mines and more than 5,000 township coal mines were built throughout the province. In addition, the Pingzhuo open-pit coal mine, jointly developed by China and the United States, was put into operation in 1987. In 1949, Shanxi's annual coal production was only 2.76 million tons. In 1979, it exceeded 100 million tons, and by 1988, the province's raw coal production reached 246 million tons. The annual production capacity of raw coal has increased by 91 times compared to 1949. From 1949 to 1988, Shanxi has produced a cumulative total of 2.966 billion tons of raw coal. In 1949, Shanxi's coal export volume was 6.2 million tons, reaching 175 million tons last year, an increase of 281.3 times, accounting for 78% of the national coal export volume; 9.7 million tons of coal were exported, an increase of 73.6 times compared to 1953. To dig out more and faster "black gold" to support the national four modernizations, the people of Shanxi have carried forward the spirit of moving mountains and working hard. They have been fighting in the mines year after year, regardless of whether it is in the cold winter or the hot summer, day or night, or during the New Year or festivals. Although the export of coal makes little profit and sometimes even loses money, they still selflessly contribute to various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Shanxi's coal export volume has been increasing year by year, with a cumulative total of 1.271 billion tons, accounting for 68.67% of the total export volume over the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic. The rapid development of the coal industry has also made many counties (districts), towns (townships), and villages in the province rich through coal.

    能源基地外运煤炭知多少  火车排列可绕地球十四圈
    去年外运煤炭达到全国外运量的百分之七十八
    几年来，山西人民紧张战斗，建成了大同二电厂、神头电厂，神头至大同通向北京的50万伏超高压输电线路。尽管山西的电力也很紧张，山西人民还是以大局为重，每年输出电力50亿千瓦时，成为全国电力输出最多的省。
    本报讯　被国家确定为能源重化工基地的山西省，建国40年来，共外销煤炭18.52亿吨，其中出口5015万吨。国内分别支援了26个省、市。自治区和8个计划单列市，国外销往23个国家和地区。如果把外销的煤炭装上火车，一个车厢一个车厢地排列起来，可绕地球14圈。
    山西的煤炭工业经过建国40年来的发展，取得了举世瞩目的辉煌成就。从1950年到1988年，国家用于山西煤矿基本建设的投资总额达130.73亿元，建成了大同、阳泉、西山、晋城、潞安、汾西、轩岗、霍县8个矿区，同时还建成遍布全省的400多个地方煤矿和5000多个乡镇煤矿。此外，由中美合资开发的平朔露天煤矿也于1987年投产。1949年，山西煤炭年产量仅有276万吨，1979年突破1亿吨大关，到1988年全省的原煤产量达到2.46亿吨，原煤的年生产能力比解放初期的1949年增长了91倍。从1949年到1988年，山西已累计生产原煤29.66亿吨。1949年，山西煤炭外销量为62万吨，去年达到1.75亿吨，增长了281.3倍，占全国煤炭外运量的78％；出口煤炭970万吨，比1953年增长73.6倍。为了能更多更快地挖出“乌金”，支援全国的四化建设，山西人民发扬了愚公移山、艰苦奋斗的精神。他们不论是在冰天雪地的严冬还是烈日炎炎的盛夏，不论白天还是黑夜，也不论过年还是过节，成年累月在井下战斗。外销煤尽管很少赚钱，甚至赔钱，但他们仍然无私地奉献给全国各个省、市、自治区。特别是党的十一届三中全会以后，山西煤炭外运量逐年增加，累计共运出12.71亿吨，占建国40年外运总量的68.67％。煤炭工业的迅速发展，还使全省出现了不少靠煤致富的县（区）、乡（镇）、村。
