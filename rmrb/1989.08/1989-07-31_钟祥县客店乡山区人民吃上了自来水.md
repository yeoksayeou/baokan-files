The people of Kezhuang Township in our county are located at the southern foot of the Daxiong Mountain. The mountains are high and the slopes are steep. The 15,000 villagers living here face great difficulties in obtaining water for drinking and daily use. Moreover, some water sources have poor water quality with high levels of harmful substances, seriously endangering the health of the villagers.

In March 1986, the township Party Committee and the township government made a decisive move to fundamentally solve the problem of drinking water and daily water use for the mountain people, putting an end to the history of generations of villagers carrying water for drinking.

Kezhuang Township has many mountain springs, most of which are located on the mid-slopes. The township took advantage of the terrain and decided to build high-level water tanks and filtration tanks, and lay down water pipes. Facing a shortage of funds, they adopted a method of joint funding from the state, collective, and individuals, raising 450,000 yuan to solve part of the funding problem. With no construction team available, they organized the township construction team to participate in the construction and mobilized the masses to dig pipelines. After more than three years of hard work, Kezhuang Township now has 9,500 people enjoying clean and hygienic tap water. An 80-year-old woman from Hefan Village said, "For eight generations, our ancestors have carried water for drinking. Now we don't have to carry water anymore. We must thank the Communist Party!"

    钟祥县客店乡山区人民吃上了自来水
    我县客店乡位于大洪山南麓，山高坡陡，居住在这里的一万五千村民，吃水用水非常困难。而且有的水源水质差，有害物质含量高，严重危害村民的身体健康。
    一九八六年三月，乡党委、乡政府下了决心要从根本上解决山区人民吃水用水问题，结束这里祖祖辈辈挑水吃的历史。
    客店乡山泉很多，大都分布在半山腰。乡里根据地形优势，决定修建高位水池和过滤池，铺设自来水管道。资金短缺，他们采取国家、集体、个人三者共同筹资的办法，集资四十五万多元，解决了部分资金问题。没有施工队伍，他们组织乡建筑队参加修建，组织群众挖管道。经过三年多时间的艰苦努力，目前客店乡已经有九千五百多人吃上了清洁卫生的自来水。贺畈村一位八十多岁的老太太说：“我们祖宗八代都挑水吃，现在吃水不用挑了，这得感谢共产党啊！”
