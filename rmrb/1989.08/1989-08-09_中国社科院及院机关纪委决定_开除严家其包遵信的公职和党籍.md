The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Academy's Discipline Inspection Commission have recently made decisions to expel Shen Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin from their positions and party membership.

Shen Jiaqi was formerly a research fellow at the Institute of Political Science of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Bao Zunxin was a deputy research fellow at the Institute of History. The decision by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences states that Shen Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin have long persistently held a bourgeois liberalization stance, participating in the incitement and organization of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. The actions of Shen and Bao have violated national laws and completely lost the basic qualifications of state officials. According to national and academy regulations, after discussion by the academy's leadership meeting, it was decided to expel Shen Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin from their positions.

The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in its reply to the Party branch of the Institute of Political Science and the Party committee of the Institute of History regarding the decision to expel Shen Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin from the party, states that a large amount of evidence shows that Shen Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin have conducted a series of evil activities aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist People's Republic of China, and have completely betrayed the party. According to the party constitution and relevant documents of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, after unanimous approval by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the academy, it was decided to expel Shen Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin from the party.

    开除严家其包遵信的公职和党籍
    本报北京8月9日讯　中国社会科学院及机关纪委日前分别作出决定，开除严家其、包遵信的公职和党籍。
    严家其原为中国社会科学院政治学所研究员，包遵信为历史所副研究员。中国社会科学院的决定指出，严家其、包遵信长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的立场，参与煽动和组织策划学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱。严、包二人的所作所为触犯了国家法律，完全丧失了国家公职人员的基本条件。按照国家和院有关规定，经院长办公会议研究决定，开除严家其、包遵信的公职。
    中国社会科学院机关纪委在给政治学研究所党总支、历史研究所党委关于开除严家其、包遵信党籍决定的报告批复中说，大量事实表明，严家其、包遵信进行了一系列以推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻社会主义的中华人民共和国为目的的罪恶活动，已经完全背叛了党。根据党章和中纪委有关文件的规定，经院机关纪律检查委员会一致通过，决定开除严家其、包遵信的党籍。
