In Beijing, dialing the number 8010381 will connect you to a service that can provide you with a satisfactory answer to any statistical data queries you may have.

This is the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center.

National statistical information is the most basic, frequent, and important information resource for a country. Four years ago, the National Bureau of Statistics decided to break the decades-long closed state of national statistical information, exploring the path of statistical information serving the public. Thus, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center was born, becoming the first window for China's vast statistical information system to open up to society and the world.

For many years, statistical departments at all levels in China have been in a closed state. Statistical materials were only accessible to a few departments and relevant personnel for official purposes. The vast majority of statistical information did not directly serve society but was locked away in iron safes, becoming "iron safe resources." The national statistical department was also seen as the most mysterious confidential department.

Reform and opening up have quickly integrated Chinese society into the global information wave, and the informatization of society requires the socialization of information. Statistical information, as a vast intangible wealth of society, must undoubtedly move towards society and be transformed into tangible wealth within society. According to experts, only 10% of the total statistical information held by the National Bureau of Statistics is classified as secret or confidential, while the rest can be made public and shared by the entire society.

In September 1984, the National Bureau of Statistics proposed to release a large amount of statistical information from safes, transforming from serving only party and government agencies to serving both domestic and international audiences. In May 1985, as the National Bureau of Statistics' window to society, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center was officially established. It is the first national statistical information consulting service institution in China. It relies on the vast statistical information network of the National Bureau of Statistics and the professional statistical teams scattered across the country, forming a "factory-store" relationship with the National Bureau of Statistics. The National Bureau of Statistics acts as the "factory," producing information, while the consulting center acts as the "store," serving society.

Some people refer to the potential information resources in society as a "gold mine." The China Statistical Information Consulting Center is a formidable team in the "gold mine" mining squad.

In the mid-1980s, the sewing machine industry in China experienced a downturn. Sewing machine sales were sluggish, leading to a large accumulation of inventory. To understand the potential of the rural market, in 1985, Shanghai Xiechang Sewing Machine Factory, known for producing the famous Butterfly brand sewing machines, approached the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center. They requested the center to conduct a survey on the rural sewing machine market. The consulting center and the factory jointly formulated a scientific questionnaire, with detailed content covering over 30,000 households in 20 provinces.

Through questionnaire analysis, the factory quickly understood the rural sewing machine market, adjusted its production direction and business strategy, and by 1987, they had received orders for products for the next five years. In the past two years, their products have begun to be exported in large quantities, earning foreign exchange, and their economic benefits are unparalleled in the industry.

To expand the consulting center's service range to society, and to better, more, and faster develop and utilize statistical information, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center started a free information service department for society in July – the Information Room. The Information Room has various statistical books and publications published in China over the years, available for free browsing by inquirers. In one corner of the Information Room, a microcomputer is available for free information processing and querying for clients. The Information Room's phone is undoubtedly busy, but every call receives a satisfactory response from the information staff.

Here, we can see that China's statistical information service industry is taking a new step.

In the past, China's statistical information exchange with the outside world was also quite backward. Until the early 1980s, China had almost no foreign-language national economic statistical books and publications. In foreign countries, statistical book exhibitions and sales rarely featured books from mainland China, with only those from Taiwan being seen. This was the weakest link in the development and utilization of China's statistical information.

To introduce China to the world, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center, upon its establishment, immediately began work on publishing English versions of Chinese statistical books.

Over the past four years, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center has collaborated with publishers in the UK, the US, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions to publish more than 10 kinds of English versions of Chinese statistical books and publications, significantly enriching the exchange of Chinese statistical information with the outside world.

Providing statistical information consulting services for a fee to foreign clients is another leg of China's statistical information going global. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun is Japan's largest economic news agency and has a significant influence worldwide. At the request of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center has provided basic information on 2,500 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in China for three consecutive years since 1986, offering reference for Japan's investment, trade, and cooperation activities in China.

In the four years since its establishment, the China Statistical Information Consulting Service Center has conducted over 200 service projects for foreign clients.

    从“铁柜”走向社会
　　——记中国统计信息咨询服务中心
    聂伟
    在北京，拨通8010381这个电话号码，你便可以就你要查询的统计数据得到一个圆满地回答。
    这里是中国统计信息咨询服务中心。
    国家的统计信息是一个国家最基本、最经常，也是最广泛、最重要的信息资源。四年前，国家统计局决定打破几十年来国家统计信息严重封闭的状态，探索统计信息面向社会为公众服务的路子。于是中国统计信息咨询服务中心便应运而生，成为我国庞大的统计信息体系走向社会、走向世界的第一个窗口。
    （一）
    多年来，我国各级统计部门基本上处于封闭状态，统计资料只有少数部门和有关人员因公可以查阅，绝大多数统计信息未能直接为社会服务，而是被锁在铁柜中，成为“铁柜资源”。国家统计部门也被看作最神秘的机要部门。
    改革开放使中国社会迅速纳入世界性的信息化潮流之中，而社会的信息化则要求信息的社会化。统计信息作为社会的一笔巨大的无形财富，无可争议地必须走向社会，在社会中转化为有形财富。据有关专家分析：国家统计局所掌握的全部统计信息中，属于机密和秘密的信息只占信息总量的10％，其余的可以公之于世，全社会共享。
    1984年9月，国家统计局提出把大量统计信息从保险柜中解放出来，由只为党政机关服务转变为同时为国内外公众服务。1985年5月，作为国家统计局为社会服务的窗口，中国统计信息咨询服务中心正式成立，这是我国第一个全国性统计信息咨询服务机构。她以国家统计局庞大的统计信息网和遍布全国各地统计专业队伍为依托，与国家统计局形成“厂店关系”。国家统计局作为“厂”，生产信息，咨询中心作为“店”，为社会服务。
    （二）
    有人把社会潜在的信息资源称为“大金矿”，中国统计信息咨询中心就是“大金矿”开采队伍中的一支劲旅。
    80年代中期，我国缝纫机行业出现不景气状况。缝纫机销售疲软，造成大量积压。为了掌握农村市场的潜力，1985年，生产著名蝴蝶牌缝纫机的上海协昌缝纫机厂找到中国统计信息咨询服务中心，请中心为他们进行农村缝纫机市场的调查。咨询中心和厂家共同制定了科学的问卷，问卷内容极为详实，调查涉及了20个省的三万多农户。
    通过问卷分析，厂家很快摸清了农村缝纫机市场的底牌，调整了生产方向和经营策略，到1987年，他们收到的订货单已订完了5年的产品。近两年，他们的产品开始大量出口创汇，经济效益在同行业中也是首屈一指。
    为了拓宽咨询中心对社会服务的范围，更好、更多、更快地开发利用统计信息，中国统计信息咨询服务中心从今年7月份起开办了对社会进行无偿信息服务的业务部门——资料室。资料室备有我国历年出版的各种统计书刊，供查询者免费查阅。在资料室的一角，一台微机可免费为客户进行信息处理和查询。资料室的电话无疑是繁忙的，但每一个电话都会得到资料员的圆满答复。
    在这里我们可以看到，中国的统计信息服务事业正在迈上一个新的台阶。
    （三）
    过去，我国统计信息的对外交流也十分落后。直到80年代初，我国几乎没有出版外文的国民经济统计书刊。在国外，统计图书的展览、展销中，中国的统计图书只有台湾的，大陆的很难见到。这是我国统计信息的开发利用中最薄弱的一个环节。
    为了把中国介绍到世界，中国统计信息咨询服务中心成立后，立即着手英文中国统计图书的出版工作。
    4年多来，中国统计信息咨询服务中心先后与英国、美国、香港等国家和地区的有关出版社联合出版了10多种英文版中国统计书刊，大大丰富了中国统计信息的对外交流。
    对外有偿提供统计信息咨询服务，是我国统计信息走向世界的另一条腿。日本经济新闻社是日本最大的经济新闻机构，在世界上较有影响。应日本经济新闻社的要求，中国统计信息咨询服务中心从1986年开始，连续三年向日本经济新闻社提供了中国2500个大中型工业企业基本情况的资料，为日本在中国的投资、贸易、合作等经济活动提供参考。
    中国统计信息咨询服务中心成立四年多来，已为国外客户开展了200多项服务业务。
