Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 13th.

Premier Li Peng flew to Qingdao today and immediately went to the scene of the fire at the Yellow Island Oil Depot. He highly praised the heroic efforts of the military and civilians of Qingdao who united to fight the fire. He demanded that every effort be made to prevent the fire from spreading and to ensure the safety of the entire oil port.

The oil storage tanks at the Yellow Island terminal of the Energy Department's Pipeline Bureau, located about four miles from Qingdao city, exploded and caught fire at 10:05 AM on August 12th due to a lightning strike. As of the time of this report at 21:00 today, the tanks are still burning, but the main fire has been controlled. The thick smoke from the burning oil has covered half the sky over the front sea. It is understood that the crude oil storage tanks that are currently burning contain about 40,000 tons of crude oil. This major crude oil fire has resulted in 5 deaths and 16 missing persons, most of whom are firefighters.

Upon learning of the explosion at the Yellow Island terminal due to a lightning strike, Premier Li Peng was very concerned. This morning, he first called the Qingdao Municipal Government to inquire about the situation and demanded strengthening the command of the firefighting efforts. Around 11:00 AM, Premier Li Peng flew to Qingdao. As soon as he got off the plane, he listened to a detailed report from Liu Peng, the Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the firefighting and rescue efforts. He highly praised the heroic actions of the military and civilians of Qingdao who united to fight the fire and was satisfied with the series of decisive and effective measures taken by the Qingdao Municipal Committee and the Qingdao Municipal Government in commanding this firefighting battle. Premier Li Peng pointed out that the current task is to concentrate on firefighting and rescue. Every effort must be made to control the fire, and every effort must be made to prevent the fire from spreading and to ensure the safety of the entire oil port.

Premier Li Peng carefully learned about the firefighting command at the scene, the evacuation of personnel around the fire zone, and the local weather conditions.

Around 3:00 PM, Premier Li Peng took a boat to the scene of the fire at Yellow Island. There, Guo Songnian, the Mayor of Qingdao who was in charge of the firefighting, and Zhao Zhihua, the Governor of Shandong Province who rushed to the scene from Jinan, gave a comprehensive report to Premier Li Peng on the firefighting situation over the past few dozen hours. Premier Li Peng went to a place only about 20 meters away from the fire zone to visit the firefighters who were fighting the fire there. Premier Li Peng shook hands with the firefighters and said, "Comrades, you have worked hard." He encouraged everyone to continue their efforts and achieve the final victory in firefighting.

Then, Premier Li Peng made a brief speech at the temporary command post for firefighting at Yellow Island. He said, the Yellow Island Oil Depot has suffered this unfortunate accident, causing 40,000 tons of crude oil to burn, and the fire threatens the entire oil wharf. At this critical moment, the responsible comrades of Shandong Province and Qingdao City have conducted correct command, and the public security officers, firefighters, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the oil port workers, have united to fight the fire. After 30 hours of struggle, the firefighting has achieved initial success.

Premier Li Peng said: In this firefighting and rescue operation, some public security and firefighting personnel unfortunately suffered casualties. They have made contributions to protecting the state and people's property. On behalf of the Party and the state, I would like to express my sincere greetings to the comrades who have made contributions in the firefighting struggle, and I would like to express my condolences to the comrades who have sacrificed their lives in the firefighting struggle, and I would like to express my condolences to the families of the injured and the deceased.

Premier Li Peng said, although this firefighting battle has achieved initial success, it has not yet achieved complete victory, and we must not be complacent. He demanded that all firefighters continue to fight tenaciously to ensure the safety of the eastern and northern areas of the disaster zone and the oil port wharf.

Premier Li Peng said, after this major fire is extinguished, production must be quickly organized. The treatment of the injured must be properly arranged, and the aftermath must be handled well. It is also necessary to seriously summarize the experience and lessons learned, to be realistic, and to learn from this incident as a negative example to improve the safety of the oil area.

Jiang Chunquan, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Peng, Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Committee, both expressed that they would seriously implement the instructions of Comrade Li Peng, spare no effort to fight this battle of firefighting, and achieve complete victory.

On the morning of August 12th, Qingdao experienced thunderstorms. An oil tank at the Yellow Island terminal was first struck by lightning and exploded, and in the afternoon, several oil storage tanks were ignited and exploded. After the fire, Qingdao City mobilized all its forces to fight the fire. Currently, nearly a hundred fire trucks are on the scene. The North Sea Fleet and the North Sea Fleet Aviation also dispatched a batch of firefighting and rescue ships and seaplanes to participate in the firefighting. At the scene of the fire, measures such as seawater cooling, spreading dry powder to extinguish the fire, and building isolation walls with sand and stones were also taken. Now the main fire has been controlled. The military and civilians are actively working to expand the victory.

    李鹏赶赴黄岛油库火灾现场
    高度赞扬青岛军民团结一致奋力灭火英勇行为  要求千方百计防止大火蔓延确保整个油港安全
    新华社青岛8月13日电（记者刘海民）国务院总理李鹏今天乘飞机到达青岛并即赶赴黄岛油库火灾现场，对参加救火抢险的公安干警、消防人员、解放军指战员、医务人员和其它部门的干部群众进行了亲切慰问。
    与青岛市区相隔四海里的能源部管道局黄岛油库末站的原油罐群12日上午10点零5分因雷击爆炸起火。到记者今天21时发稿时油罐仍在燃烧，但主要火势已得到控制。燃烧的浓浓油烟，遮盖了前海的半边天空。据了解，正在燃烧的这些原油储存罐内储存的原油有4万吨左右。这场特大的原油火灾已造成5人死亡、16人失踪，失踪者大部分是消防队员。
    李鹏总理获悉黄岛油库末站因雷击发生爆炸后十分关心。今天上午他先打电话给青岛市人民政府询问灾情，并要求加强对灭火的指挥。上午11时左右，李鹏总理又乘飞机赶到青岛。他一下飞机就详细听取了中共青岛市委书记刘鹏对这次灭火抢险的报告。他高度赞扬了青岛市军民团结一致，奋力灭火的英勇行动，对青岛市委、青岛市政府在指挥这场灭火斗争中采取的一系列果断有效的措施表示满意。李鹏总理指出，眼下要集中力量灭火和救人。要千方百计把火情控制住，一定要防止大火蔓延，确保整个油港的安全。
    李鹏总理详细了解了火灾现场的消防指挥、疏散火区周围人员和当地的气象条件等情况。
    下午3点左右，李鹏总理乘船到达黄岛火灾现场。在那里担任灭火总指挥的青岛市市长郭松年和从济南赶来现场的山东省省长赵志浩等，就几十个小时的现场救火情况向李鹏总理做了全面汇报。李鹏总理来到距火区只有20多米远的地方，看望了正在那里奋力灭火的消防战士。李鹏总理握着消防队员的手说：“同志们辛苦了。”他勉励大家再接再厉，夺取灭火的最后胜利。
    接着，李鹏总理在黄岛灭火临时指挥部里作了简短的讲话。他说，黄岛油库发生了这场不幸的事故，造成4万吨原油燃烧，大火威胁着整个油码头。在关键时刻，山东省和青岛市的负责同志进行了正确的指挥，公安干警、消防人员和解放军指战员以及油港职工齐心协力，经过30个小时的奋斗，灭火已取得了初步胜利。
    李鹏总理说：在这场灭火抢险中，一些公安、消防人员不幸遭受伤亡，他们为保卫国家和人民的财产做出了贡献。我代表党和国家向在灭火斗争中做出贡献的同志表示亲切慰问，向在灭火斗争中牺牲的同志表示哀悼，向受伤和牺牲者的家属表示慰问。
    李鹏总理说，这场灭火斗争虽然取得了初步胜利，但还没有取得彻底胜利，不可麻痹大意。他要求全体灭火人员继续顽强战斗，确保灾区东、北区和油港码头的安全。
    李鹏总理说，这场大火扑灭以后，要迅速组织生产。要妥善安排好伤员的治疗问题，做好善后工作。还需要认真总结经验教训，要实事求是，举一反三，以这次事故作为改进油区安全生产的可以借鉴的反面教材。
    中共山东省委书记姜春云和青岛市委书记刘鹏都表示，要认真贯彻李鹏同志的指示精神，全力以赴地打好救火这一仗，夺取完全胜利。
    青岛市12日上午雷雨交加。黄岛油库末站的一个油罐先遭雷击爆炸起火，下午又有几个储油罐被烈火引爆。火灾发生后，青岛市全力投入了灭火战斗。目前现场参加救火的有近百辆消防车。北海舰队和北海舰队航空兵也派出一批消防救生船和水上飞机参加扑救。在火灾现场还采取了海水冷却、撒干粉灭火和用沙石建立隔离墙等救火措施。现在主要火势已得到遏制。军民们正在积极努力，扩大战果。
