On May 4 of this year, Comrade Zhao Ziyang met with representatives from various countries attending the Asian Development Bank meeting and delivered a speech that was completely different from the central government's stance and policies. The publication of this speech became a turning point for the escalation of the turmoil. The development of the political turmoil in Shanxi Province fully proves this point.

Before Zhao Ziyang's "ADB" speech was published, the political situation in Shanxi Province was basically stable. After the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang on April 15, influenced by Beijing, some universities in Shanxi Province posted big-character posters, flyers, banners, and couplets, mainly to mourn Hu Yaobang. Some of these also spread rumors and attacked central leaders. After the mourning activities ended, a few students in some universities began to link up with each other, copying and posting flyers and big-character posters from Beijing. Some individuals even issued "statements" and gave speeches, attacking the Four Cardinal Principles and inciting students to take to the streets to demonstrate and support the students in Beijing. However, these activities were limited to the schools and did not have a significant impact on society. On April 26, the People's Daily published the editorial "We Must Resolutely Oppose the Turmoil," exposing the conspiracy of a few people to create turmoil and educating the entire Party and the people of the nation, as well as the broad masses of young students. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee seized this opportunity to organize Party members, cadres, and the masses throughout the province to seriously study and discuss the spirit of the editorial, clarify their understanding, and unify their thoughts. During this period, from factories to rural areas, from offices to schools, stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation became the common wish and demand of the people of the entire province. A few people, in order to continue to deceive the broad masses of young students, also changed their tactics, raising the banner of supporting the Four Cardinal Principles, fighting corruption, and overthrowing officials. They spread political rumors, inciting a "May 4" large-scale march to support Beijing. On the evening of May 3, a few students from Taiyuan University of Technology, ignoring warnings, rushed out of the campus, linking up with students from Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi University of Finance and Economics, and Shanxi University, and marched to the provincial government building to sit in and demonstrate in the early morning of May 4. The students' actions did not receive much response from society but were instead criticized by the workers and citizens of the provincial capital. It was understood at the time that the students' actions were merely to show their support for the students in Beijing. After the provincial government's staff reached an agreement with the student representatives to hold a dialogue, the marching students dispersed. All of this indicated that before Zhao Ziyang's "ADB" speech was published, the big-character posters, linking up, and demonstrations in Shanxi Province were influenced and triggered by Beijing. Only a few students from some universities participated in these activities, and the workers, citizens, office staff, and the majority of students in the provincial capital did not approve of this approach. The situation in Shanxi Province was calm, and the work order, production order, study order, and the order of the people's lives were normal. The overall political situation was stable.

On the evening of May 4, after Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech to the ADB representatives was broadcast on radio and television, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. A few people who created the turmoil saw the inconsistency in the central government's attitude from the "speech" and saw that someone in the central government publicly supported them. They sensed the opportunity, found their backing, and became even more brazen, causing more and more trouble and making it bigger and bigger. The overall public opinion and public psychology in Shanxi Province underwent significant fluctuations and shifts. Universities quickly showed a phenomenon of "siding with one side," with the majority of students, under the influence of the idea that "not marching means not being patriotic," flocking to the streets to march. A few students who did not participate in the marches were ridiculed, attacked, and isolated, and were mocked as "academic thieves." Political cadres and teachers who worked on the front lines of the student movement felt betrayed and thought they could no longer stand in opposition to the students and be a "stumbling block" for the student movement. Various levels of Party committees and many leading cadres saw the emergence of two different voices in the central government and felt confused and bewildered. Many measures to stop the student marches were also difficult to implement. In this situation, the situation that had been calming down suddenly reversed, and the student movement gradually developed into political turmoil. Its characteristics were: (1) The scale of marches and demonstrations became larger and larger. From May 5 to May 19, there were almost daily large-scale marches and demonstrations in the provincial capital, with the number of participants ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand, and at its peak reaching tens of thousands. The participants expanded from college students to vocational school and middle school students, and from students to the cultural, media, and theoretical circles. (2) A large number of big-character posters, slogans, and banners attacking and insulting the central and provincial leaders emerged, with more vicious and reactionary content, and political rumors became more and more prevalent and more and more perverse. (3) Various illegal organizations emerged one after another, and the student movement developed towards a unified program, unified slogan, unified organization, and unified action. From May 5 to May 19, more than 60 illegal organizations such as the "Shanxi University Self-Government Federation," "Student Union," "Provincial City Workers' Self-Funding," "Workers' Party," and "Shanxi Fire" emerged in the provincial capital. More than 200 social dregs and lawless elements organized the "Feather Duster Squad," carrying banners, flags, and feather dusters, shouting slogans and parading through the streets. These illegal organizations linked up with each other, unified their steps, and put forward the "minimum program" and "maximum program" for action. (4) Behavior became more and more intense. Illegal organizations in some universities seized the campus radio station, openly broadcasted "Voice of America," and spread political rumors. They repeatedly stormed Party, government, and military leadership organs and important news agencies in the provincial capital, removed the signs of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government, injured public security officers, threw bread and placards at public security officers on duty, and hoisted white flags in front of the Provincial Government building. On May 16, more than 400 students from some universities went to the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government buildings to fast and petition. Some students lay on the tracks to block traffic, forcibly boarded trains to Beijing to support the cause, with a total of 5,000 students going to Beijing. Thirteen schools in the provincial capital, with 14,000 students and a few teachers, set up a memorial hall in Taiyuan's May 1st Square to hold a memorial service for the "martyrs" who fasted in Beijing. Under the instigation of a few people, students from some universities went to large enterprises such as Taiyuan Steel and Taiyuan Heavy Machinery to incite and stir up trouble, shouting "to paralyze the power grid, coal, and transportation in North China and force the Li Peng government to step down." (5) A few lawless elements took the opportunity to disrupt social order and engage in looting activities. On May 17, 18, and 19, for three consecutive days, a few lawless elements mixed in with the marching crowds and onlookers, and in a heartless and ruthless manner, threw soda bottles, bricks, and tiles at on-duty officers, smashed cars, smashed store windows and nearby residents' glass, and publicly insulted public security officers and molested women in the crowd, destroying traffic barriers without restraint. In three days, 92 public security officers were injured, and 63 vehicles of various types were damaged, seriously disrupting the public order in the provincial capital.

More seriously, on May 10, a serious political incident occurred when the opening ceremony of the second "Two Conferences and One Festival" was stormed. The Shanxi International Economic and Technological Cooperation Fair, Import and Export Commodity Fair, and Folk Art Festival (collectively referred to as "Two Conferences and One Festival") is a large-scale foreign-related activity held every two years in Shanxi Province. It combines economic and technological cooperation, foreign economic and trade, and folk art festivals, and is a beneficial attempt to implement opening up and cooperation with the outside world. After several years of practice, it has become an important window and channel for Shanxi's foreign exchanges, playing an active role in promoting Shanxi's economy and society, and having a significant impact both domestically and internationally. To successfully hold this year's "Two Conferences and One Festival," the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, and relevant departments at all levels, cities, and provinces have made meticulous plans and careful preparations. The main leaders of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have also repeatedly reminded students through various channels and forms, pointing out that "Two Conferences and One Festival" is a major foreign-related activity, and at that time, thousands of foreign businessmen and guests will come to participate. They requested that the students, for the sake of Shanxi's overall situation, ensure the normal holding of the "Two Conferences and One Festival." However, influenced by Zhao Ziyang's May 4 "ADB" speech, a few people became emboldened. Under their instigation, more than 4,000 students, ignoring warnings, forcibly broke through three lines of defense and rushed into the artistic performance team of the "Two Conferences and One Festival" opening ceremony, shouting slogans such as "Two Conferences and One Festival, Officials' Gathering," "Two Conferences and One Festival, Wasteful Wasteful." They paraded back and forth among the tens of thousands of onlookers, causing the solemn opening ceremony to be disrupted in the middle. At noon, thousands of students broke through the armed police line, injuring more than a dozen armed police officers, and forcibly rushed into the main venue of the "Two Conferences and One Festival," the Yuzhi Hotel, demanding to see the governor. They then repeatedly stormed the Yuzhi Hotel lobby. Some students threw bread, buns, and eggs at public security officers, making the hotel courtyard filthy. Some students even shouted slogans such as "Overthrow the Foreign Officials," "Two Conferences and One Festival, Bribery and Corruption" and marched and demonstrated outside the Yuzhi Hotel and Shanxi Grand Hotel, which were receiving foreign guests and businessmen, causing a very bad impact. That afternoon, some foreign businessmen interrupted negotiations and left Taiyuan. Those who did not leave also felt frightened, had a heavy psychological burden, and doubted Shanxi's investment environment, affecting the negotiation of projects and import and export commodity transactions to a certain extent. Some Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign journalists took photos and videos of the storming scene from the upper floors of the Yuzhi Hotel and sent them overseas, causing a very bad political impact internationally. The broad masses of the people in Shanxi Province expressed great indignation and sorrow over the students' storming of the opening ceremony of the "Two Conferences and One Festival." It can be imagined that if there had been no interference from the student marchers, this year's "Two Conferences and One Festival" would have achieved greater economic and social benefits.

After Zhao Ziyang's "ADB" speech was published, facing the complex political situation, although the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government were once confused, they did not retreat from the principles and stance of the April 26 editorial. First, they organized Party members, cadres, and public security officers to seriously study the April 26 editorial, using the spirit of the editorial to unify their thoughts and actions. They clearly required all levels of Party organizations and the majority of Party members and cadres to stand firm, resist the current, distinguish right from wrong, and consciously do not march, do not watch, and do not listen to or spread rumors. Second, they actively and positively did work to win over the broad masses of young students in various universities, exposing and isolating a few people who created the turmoil. Third, they fully played the role of public opinion in stabilizing the situation and insisted on the correct guidance of public opinion. Fourth, they vigorously promoted clean governance and demonstrated the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government's determination to fight corruption. Fifth, they went deep into key industrial and mining enterprises in the provincial capital, organized "factory protection teams," and stabilized the factories and workers. Sixth, they allocated forces to strengthen the protection of key departments and organs. Seventh, they took decisive measures to severely crack down on lawless elements who engaged in looting. On May 17, 18, and 19, they sealed off the scene for three consecutive days, concentrating on arresting and cracking down on more than 300 lawless elements, stopping the rampage of the rioters. Through these efforts, they relatively early stopped the turmoil in the provincial capital and stabilized the overall situation in the province. Later, when the counter-revolutionary turmoil broke out in Beijing, the situation in Shanxi had already been basically stabilized.

The above analysis shows that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech at the ADB was the turning point for the development of the student movement into political turmoil in Shanxi Province. It objectively played a detrimental role in escalating the situation. It is entirely reasonable to say that without this speech, there would not have been political turmoil in Shanxi Province. If it were not for the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government's resolute implementation of the central government's correct policies and taking effective measures to stop the turmoil, Shanxi Province would inevitably have experienced even greater turmoil.

    赵紫阳的“亚行”讲话与山西省城的政治动乱
    秦越
    今年5月4日，赵紫阳同志在会见参加亚洲开发银行会议各国代表时，发表了一篇同中央的立场和方针完全不同的谈话。这篇讲话的发表，成了动乱急剧升级的转折点。从山西省城的政治动乱发展来看，就充分证明了这一点。
    在赵紫阳“亚行”讲话发表之前，山西省城的政治形势基本上是稳定的。4月15日，胡耀邦同志逝世以后，受北京的影响，山西省部分高等院校出现了一些大小字报、传单、条幅和挽联，内容主要是悼念胡耀邦同志，也有一些是造谣惑众、影射攻击中央领导同志的。悼念活动结束之后，部分高校的个别学生互相串联，传抄、张贴北京的传单和大小字报，还有个别人发表“声明”和演说，攻击四项基本原则，煽动学生上街游行示威，声援北京学生。但是，这些活动只在学校内，并没有对社会造成较大影响。4月26日，人民日报《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》的社论的发表，揭露了极少数人制造动乱的阴谋，教育了全党和全国人民，也教育了广大青年学生。山西省委抓住这一有利时机，组织全省的党员、干部和群众，认真学习讨论社论精神，澄清认识，统一思想。在这一期间，从工厂到农村，从机关到学校，制止动乱，稳定局势成为全省人民的共同愿望和要求。极少数人为了继续蒙蔽广大青年学生，也改变策略，打出了拥护四项基本原则、惩治腐败、打倒官倒的旗帜。他们散布政治谣言，煽动举行“五四”大游行，声援北京。5月3日晚，太原工业大学部分学生不听劝阻，冲出校园，串联山西医学院、山西财经学院和山西大学的部分学生，于5月4日凌晨游行到省政府门前静坐示威。学生的这些行动并未在社会上引起多大的响应，反而遭到省城广大工人和市民的斥责。据当时了解，学生们的这一举动，仅仅是不愿保持沉默，声援北京学生。当省政府工作人员与学生代表达成对话协议之后，游行的学生即行散去。这一切都表明，在赵紫阳“亚行”讲话发表之前，山西省城出现的张贴大小字报、互相串联和游行示威，是受北京影响诱发产生的。参加这些活动的仅仅是部分高校少数学生，省城的广大工人、市民、机关干部和绝大多数学生是不赞成这种做法的。山西省城的事态是平缓的，工作秩序、生产秩序、学习秩序和人民群众的生活秩序是正常的，整个政治局面是安定的。
    5月4日晚，当赵紫阳同志会见亚行代表的讲话通过广播电视发表以后，形势急转直下。极少数制造动乱的人从“讲话”中看到了中央内部的态度不一致，看到了中央有人公开支持他们。他们摸到了气候，找到了后台，于是更加有恃无恐，越闹越凶，越闹越大；山西省城的整个社会舆论和群众心理发生了较大反复和倾斜，高校中迅速出现了“一边倒”的现象，绝大多数学生在“不游行就是不爱国”的思想支配下，纷纷上街游行；少数不参加游行示威的学生受到耻笑、围攻和孤立，被讥讽为“学贼”；在学潮第一线做工作的政工干部和教师感到被出卖了，认为再不能站到学生的对立面，做学生运动的“绊脚石”了；各级党委和许多领导干部从中看到中央出现了两种不同的声音，感到迷惘和不解，许多制止学生游行的措施也难以出手。在这种情况下，本来已趋向平缓的局势骤然逆转，学潮逐步发展成为政治动乱。其特点是：（一）游行示威的规模越来越大。从5月5日开始到5月19日，在省城几乎每天都有数起较大规模的游行示威和声援活动，参加的人数从几百人到几千人，最多时达数万人。参加的人员由大专院校的学生扩展到中专、中学生，由学生扩展到文艺界、新闻界、理论界。（二）各种攻击、谩骂中央和省委领导的大小字报、标语、口号大量增加，内容更加恶毒、反动，政治谣言越来越多，越传越邪。（三）各种非法组织相继出现，学潮向着统一纲领、统一口号、统一组织、统一行动的方向发展。从5月5日到5月19日，省城陆续出现了“山西高校自治联合会”、“学工会”、“省城工自筹”、“工人党”和“山西一把火”等60多个非法组织。200余名社会渣滓和不法之徒组织了“鸡毛掸子队”，他们扛着门旗、彩旗和鸡毛掸子，喊着口号招摇过市。这些非法组织互相串联，统一步骤，提出了行动的“最低纲领”和“最高纲领”。（四）行为越来越激烈。部分高校的非法组织抢占校广播站，公开播放“美国之音”，大肆传播政治谣言；连续几次冲击党政军领导机关和省城重要新闻单位，挤掉省委、省政府的牌子，挤伤公安干警，向执行公务的公安干警投掷馒头和标语牌，在省政府门前升白旗；5月16日，部分高校的400余名学生到省委、省政府门前绝食请愿；部分学生卧轨断道，强行登车进京声援，前后进京的学生达5000人；省城13所院校14000名学生和少数教师在太原市五一广场设置灵堂，为北京绝食“英烈”召开追悼会；在极少数人的带动下，部分高校学生分别到太钢、太重等大型企业进行蛊惑煽动，叫嚷“要把华北地区的电网、煤炭、交通搞瘫痪，逼李鹏政府下台”。（五）极少数不法之徒乘机扰乱社会治安，搞打砸抢活动。5月17、18、19连续3天，极少数不法分子混在游行队伍和围观群众中，丧心病狂地向值勤干警投掷汽水瓶、砖头、瓦片，疯狂地砸汽车，砸商店和附近居民的玻璃，肆无忌惮地在人群中公开侮辱公安干警，调戏妇女，破坏交通隔离墩。3天中打伤公安干警92人，砸坏各种车辆63辆，使省城的治安秩序遭到严重破坏。
    更为严重的是，在5月10日发生了冲击第二届“两会一节”开幕式的严重政治事件。山西省国际经济技术合作洽谈会、进出口商品交易会和民间艺术节（简称“两会一节”）是山西省两年一度的大型涉外活动，是把经济技术洽谈、对外经济贸易和民间艺术节结合在一起，实行对外开放、对外合作的有益尝试。经过几年的实践，已成为山西对外交流的重要窗口和渠道，对山西经济和社会的发展起到了积极的推动作用，并在国内外具有较大影响。为办好今年的“两会一节”，山西省委、省政府以及各地、市和省直有关部门作了周密的计划和精心准备。省委、省政府的主要领导同志还通过各种渠道和形式，多次向学生打招呼。指出“两会一节”是重大的涉外活动，届时将有千名外商、外宾前来参加，务请同学们从山西大局出发，确保“两会一节”的正常举行。但是，受赵紫阳五四“亚行”讲话的影响，极少数人有恃无恐。在他们的煽动下，4000多名学生不听劝阻，强行冲开三道防线，冲入“两会一节”开幕式的文艺表演队伍中，高呼“一节两会，官倒聚会”、“一节两会，浪费浪费”等口号。在数十万围观群众中来回穿梭，致使隆重的开幕仪式中途被冲散。中午，数千名学生冲破武警防线，挤伤十几名武警战士，强行冲入“两会一节”的主会场迎泽宾馆院内，要求面见省长。随后又多次冲击迎泽宾馆大厅。部分学生向公安干警扔面包、馒头、鸡蛋，把宾馆院内搞得污秽不堪。有的学生甚至高喊“打倒洋倒”、“两会两会，行贿受贿”的口号，在接待外宾、外商的迎泽宾馆、山西大酒店外游行示威，造成了极其恶劣的影响。当天下午，就有部分外商中断谈判离开太原；没有离开的也感到恐慌，心理压力较大，对山西的投资环境产生怀疑，洽谈的项目和进出口商品交易都受到了一定影响；一些港台和国外记者，在迎泽宾馆楼上拍摄冲击的现场照片和录像，发往海外，在国际上造成了极坏的政治影响。对学生冲击“两会一节”开幕式的行为，山西省城广大群众都表示了极大的愤慨和痛心。可以想象，如果没有学生游行队伍的冲击和干扰，今年的“两会一节”将会收到更大的经济效益和社会效益。
    赵紫阳同志在“亚行”讲话发表后，面对复杂的政治形势，山西省委、省政府虽一度感到困惑，但没有从“四·二六”社论的原则立场后退。一是组织党员、干部和公安干警认真学习“四·二六”社论，用社论精神统一思想，统一行动。明确要求各级党组织和广大党员干部必须站稳立场，顶住逆流，明辨是非，自觉做到不游行，不围观，不听信和传播谣言。二是深入各高校积极主动地做争取广大青年学生的工作，揭露和孤立极少数制造动乱的人。三是充分发挥宣传舆论在稳定局势中的作用，坚持正确的舆论导向。四是狠抓廉政建设，表明省委、省政府惩治腐败的决心。五是深入到省城重点工矿企业，组织“护厂队”，稳定工厂和工人队伍。六是抽调力量，加强对首脑机关和要害部门的保卫工作。七是采取坚决措施，严厉打击搞打砸抢的不法分子。5月17、18、19三日，连续三次封闭现场，集中抓捕打击300余名不法分子，刹住了暴徒的嚣张气焰。通过这些工作，较早地制止了省城的动乱，稳定了全省的大局。在后来北京发生反革命暴乱时，山西的局势已经基本稳定。
    以上分析表明，赵紫阳同志在“亚行”的讲话，是山西省城由学潮到政治动乱的转折点。它在客观上起到了使事态逐步升级的恶劣作用。完全有理由说，没有这篇讲话，就不会有山西省城的政治动乱。要不是省委、省政府坚决执行中央的正确方针，采取有力措施，制止动乱，山西省城必然会出现更大的动乱。
