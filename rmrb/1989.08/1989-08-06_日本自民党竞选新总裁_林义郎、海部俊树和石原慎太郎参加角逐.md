The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is holding elections for a new president. Today is the day for candidates to register. By 11 AM, the following had registered: former Minister of Health and Welfare Hayashi Yoshiro, former Minister of Education Hirabayashi Toshiki, and former Minister of Transport Ishihara Shintaro. This sets up a three-way race to succeed Uno.

At 2 PM, the three candidates held a joint press conference to express their motivations and aspirations for running for president. On major issues such as the consumption tax and political reform, their platforms were largely similar. All three agreed that the LDP is facing its greatest crisis since its founding and that political reform is necessary to discard the old and usher in the new. They all agreed that the consumption tax cannot be abolished and needs to be amended.

The LDP's presidential election is the first since 1972. According to the schedule, on August 8, 452 LDP members of parliament and local representatives will vote by secret ballot to elect the new president. The winner must secure more than half of the votes. If no candidate secures more than half in the first round, the top two candidates will proceed to a runoff. The three major factions within the LDP—led by Takeshita, Abe, and Nakasone—have all expressed support for Hirabayashi Toshiki. Among the three candidates, Hirabayashi holds a clear advantage. On August 9, the new prime minister of Japan will be elected in an extraordinary session of parliament.

    本报东京8月5日电　记者于青报道：今天是自民党选举总裁的候选人报名日。到上午11点截止，先后报名的是：前厚生大臣林义郎、前文部大臣海部俊树、前运输大臣石原慎太郎。宇野后任形成三人竞选的形势。
    下午2点，3个候选人共同举行记者会见，表述自己竞选总裁的动机和抱负。3人在消费税和政治改革等主要问题上政见大同小异。都认为自民党面临结党以来的最大危机，通过政治改革弃旧图新。都认为消费税不能废除，需要修改。
    自民党选举总裁是1972年以来第一次。按日程，8月8日，由自民党国会议员和地方代表共452人无记名投票选出新总裁。当选者必须获得过半数的投票。如第一次投票3人都不过半数，取获票数较多的前两人，进行再次投票选出新总裁。自民党内的竹下、安倍、中曾根三大派阀首领均表明支持海部俊树。3个候选人中海部俊树占居优势。9日将在临时国会上指名选举日本新首相。
