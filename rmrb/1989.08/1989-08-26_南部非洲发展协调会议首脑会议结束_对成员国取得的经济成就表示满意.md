The 10th Summit of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference concluded yesterday in Harare. The conference's communiqué stated that the meeting was satisfied with the economic improvements and achievements made by member countries.

The communiqué said that the average GDP growth rate in this region is now approximately 4.5%, reflecting a genuine increase in national income and a reversal of economic decline over the past decade. This positive outcome is the result of economic adjustment measures taken by most member countries.

The leaders attending the conference mentioned that member countries have made progress in implementing the action plan of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, particularly in adopting regional industrialization strategies, adjusting food reserve plans, establishing appropriate storage facilities, and promoting intra-regional food trade.

The conference also noted that due to power shortages, vehicle constraints, and the poor condition of some lines, the transportation capacity of the regional railway system has not significantly improved.

The conference welcomed the peace efforts made by the governments of Angola and Mozambique, emphasizing the need to restore economic construction after the restoration of peace and to address the resettlement of people displaced by the conflict. The conference strongly urged the international community to provide assistance in these areas.

While welcoming the implementation of UN Resolution 435, the conference expressed concern over South Africa's covert efforts to disrupt the pre-election work for a free and fair election in Namibia. Therefore, the conference called on the Security Council and the international community to take measures to ensure that the self-determination rights of the Namibian people are not violated.

The conference urged the South African authorities to release authoritative political leaders and lift the ban on their organizations. The conference also strongly demanded that South Africa end apartheid and establish a political system acceptable to all.

The conference decided to hold a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference in Lusaka on April 1, 1990, and its regular meeting will be held in Gaborone in August 1990.

The 10th Summit of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference was held in Harare on August 25.

Zimbabwean President Mugabe, in his opening speech, called on the member countries of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference to achieve economic liberation through cooperation.

Tanzanian President Mwinyi presided over the meeting on August 25.

The chairman of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, Botswana President Masire, did not attend this meeting due to health reasons.

The nine member countries of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference are: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
