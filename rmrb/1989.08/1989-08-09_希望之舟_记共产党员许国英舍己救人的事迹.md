In the wake of the devastating flood on July 2, the house of Communist Party member Xu Guoying in Chaixi Township, Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province, collapsed at 5:30 AM on July 5. As the furniture and suitcases were swept away by the raging waters, many people remarked, "If Xu Guoying had taken a moment to save her own home, she wouldn't have suffered such heavy losses."

At 8 PM on July 2, the surging floodwaters rushed into the village and then into the homes. Xu Guoying's family quickly prepared their small boat to move their belongings to higher ground. Around 9 PM, cries for help echoed from the Chen Yunlin family across the way. Xu Guoying immediately abandoned her own belongings and rowed the boat over.

At 56 years old, Xu Guoying had been a party member for nearly 20 years, serving as the village women's director and a member of the village committee. Although she couldn't swim, she had excellent boating skills. In the dark night, she navigated to the Chen family's roof, where five family members had taken refuge. Xu Guoying rowed her boat over, first rescuing the people and then transporting their belongings. She made three trips, helping the Chen family move to a safer, higher location.

It was already the next morning when Xu Guoying was rowing back home. Suddenly, she heard cries for help from the Hu Qingrong family.

"Should I save them or not?" Xu Guoying had had disputes with the Hu family in the past, to the point where they wouldn't even greet each other when they met. But in this life-or-death moment, Xu Guoying resolutely set aside their past grievances. She told her son Liu Zhonglin to quickly row the boat to the Hu family. The small boat made several trips through the raging waters, safely rescuing Hu Qingrong's family of four and some of their belongings. Afterwards, Xu Guoying and her daughter-in-law Huang Jinxian rescued the Ye Zhanggen family of five from the floodwaters.

Xu Guoying and her children worked tirelessly for an entire day and night, rescuing a total of 14 villagers. At this point, Xu Guoying thought of the household appliances and new furniture she had prepared for her son's wedding. As a mother, she suggested quickly saving these items. However, the raging floodwaters gave them no chance. The cries for help from the Hu San family grew more urgent. Xu Guoying glanced at her own house, which was submerged in water, and rowed the boat towards the Hu San family...

For two full days and nights, Xu Guoying endured hunger and fatigue, helping one family after another to safety. When she finally rowed back to where her home had been, she found that it was gone. The four rooms and kitchen had collapsed, and all her belongings had been washed away by the flood.

Facing the leaders and villagers who came to comfort her, Xu Guoying said, "Things are secondary; the lives of the villagers are what matter. If I had seen them in danger and done nothing, I wouldn't be worthy of being a Communist Party member."

    “希望之舟”
     ——记共产党员许国英舍己救人的事迹
     余卫军　丁艺宏　张春良
    在“7·2”特大洪水的冲刷下，浙江省兰溪市赤溪乡插口村女共产党员许国英家的房屋，于7月5日早晨5时半缓缓倒塌了。望着那些随激流漂走的家具、皮箱，不少人这样说：“如果许国英稍稍顾一下自己的家，也不至于损失这么惨。”
    7月2日晚8时，猛涨的洪水逼进村庄，随即进了家门。许国英一家连忙整好自家的小船，准备向高地搬运东西。9时许，从对面陈云林家中传来了阵阵呼救声。许国英立即丢下自家的东西，将小船划了过去。
    今年56岁的许国英，入党已近20年，曾任村妇女主任、村支部委员。她虽不会游泳，但有良好的撑船技术。她在茫茫夜色里，分辨出陈家老小5口已爬上了房顶。许国英将小船靠过去，先救人，再运物，往返3次，帮陈家转移到了远处的高地上。
    已是次日凌晨，许国英划着船正想回家，猛然又听到胡庆荣家的呼救声。
    “救，还是不救？”胡庆荣过去曾与许国英家闹过纠纷，以致见面时相互都不打招呼。可在此生死关头，许国英毅然把“前嫌”甩到了脑后，她叫儿子刘忠林赶快把船划向胡家。小船又在激流中往返了数趟，胡庆荣夫妇和两个孩子及一部分物品被安全转移。随后，许国英与大儿媳黄金仙又从洪水围困中救出了叶樟根一家5口。
    许国英和她的孩子们整整忙了一天一夜，先后营救出14位乡亲。这时，许国英想到家中为儿子结婚准备的一些家用电器和新家具。作为母亲，她提出赶快把这些东西抢运出来。可是狂虐的洪水连这点机会也没给许国英他们。胡三三家的呼救声一阵紧一阵地传来。许国英瞟了一眼在水中浸泡着的自家房屋，又把船划向胡三三家……
    整整两个昼夜，许国英忍饥奋战，帮助一家又一家转危为安。当她拖着疲惫不堪的身体划船寻找自己的家时，“家”已不复存在，4间土屋和厨房全倒塌了，家里的东西被洪水冲得荡然无存。
    面对前去慰问的领导和乡亲，许国英说：“东西是次要的，乡亲们的生命才是重要的，我如见死不救，就不配当共产党员。”
