Beijing and Tianjin are intensifying efforts to clean up their book and magazine markets, with notable results in Tianjin's crackdown on "yellow" (pornographic) materials.

Beijing is further cleaning up and rectifying its book, newspaper, and magazine markets, as well as its audio-visual markets, to promote socialist spiritual civilization in the capital.

In recent years, the spread of bourgeois liberalization and the corrupting influence of the idea that "everything revolves around money," coupled with management chaos, have led to an influx of spiritual garbage into Beijing's markets. Although the municipal government has conducted citywide "yellow" crackdowns and campaigns against illegal publications annually, the problems persist due to the overarching environment.

Since July, the city has mobilized over 2,000 personnel to inspect book and magazine markets more than 200 times, seizing 43,000-plus books and magazines, destroying 377,000-plus books and magazines found in printing houses, and sealing off 100,000-plus books and magazines and 690,000-plus newspapers. While the book and magazine markets have shown some improvement, many issues remain.

Deputy Mayor He Luli pointed out that a citywide large-scale inspection should be conducted, with districts and counties as units, dividing responsibilities by area. Based on self-inspections and the scope of investigations specified in the documents, all bookstores, bookstalls, book kiosks, state-owned and collective shops selling audio-visual products, individual vendors, and video screening points in the region should be inspected one by one.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 26th.

Starting from improving public awareness, Tianjin has mobilized the masses to deeply engage in the "yellow" crackdown, achieving remarkable results.

Since late July, relevant departments in Tianjin have taken various measures to create a strong public opinion, actively guiding the public to enhance their awareness. These publicity efforts have educated some book and magazine as well as audio-visual operating units and individuals, who not only stopped purchasing yellow publications but also voluntarily sealed off or handed in banned books and magazines.

To strengthen public participation, some districts have established a "three-level reporting network" at the district, street, and residential committee levels. With the support and assistance of the public, Tianjin's "yellow" crackdown has yielded significant results. From July 28th to August 6th, a total of over 20,000 obscene items were seized, 92 hooligan gangs were dismantled, and over 1,400 criminals were apprehended.

While cracking down on yellow books and magazines, various districts and counties in Tianjin are also actively expanding the network of libraries in factories, schools, and neighborhoods, providing the public with healthy spiritual nourishment.

    北京进一步清理书刊市场  天津开展“扫黄”成果可观
    本报北京8月26日讯　记者颜世贵报道：北京市昨天召开会议，对进一步清理整顿书报刊和音像市场作出具体部署，努力促进首都的社会主义精神文明建设。
    近年来，由于资产阶级自由化的泛滥和“一切向钱看”的思想腐蚀，加之管理上的混乱，大量的精神垃圾充斥首都市场。市政府虽然每年开展全市性的“扫黄”及打击非法出版物的活动，但受“大气候”的影响，问题屡禁不止。
    今年7月以来，全市出动2000多人次，检查书刊市场200余次，收缴书刊4.3万多册，从印刷厂查获销毁37.7万多册，封存书刊10万多册，报纸6.9万多张。书刊市场有所好转，然而，仍然存在不少问题。
    副市长何鲁丽在讲话中就此提出：进行一次全市规模的大检查，以区县为单位，分片包干，在自查的基础上，根据文件规定的查处范围，对本地区所有的书店、书摊、书亭，销售音像制品的国营、集体商店，个体摊商及录像放映点逐一进行检查。
    据新华社天津8月26日电　（记者张淑英）从提高群众思想认识入手，天津市发动群众深入“扫黄”，取得了显著成效。
    7月下旬开始，天津市有关部门采取多种措施大造舆论，积极引导群众提高认识。这些舆论宣传使一些书刊及音像经营单位和个人受到了教育，他们不仅不再购进黄色出版物，有的还主动封存或上缴查禁的书刊。
    为了增强群众的参与意识，有的区还建立了区、街、居委会“三级举报网”。在群众的支持帮助下，天津市“扫黄”战果可观。自7月28日至8月6日，共收缴淫秽物品2万多件，摧毁流氓团伙92个，查获犯罪分子1400余人。
    在查禁黄色书刊的同时，天津市各区县还积极扩大工厂、学校、街道等图书馆网络，向广大群众提供健康的精神食粮。
