    Price increases slowed down and fiscal revenue and expenditure improved in July, indicating a new turnaround in the national economy. However, the main problems remain structural irrationality, market stagnation, product backlog, and declining economic benefits.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21 (Reporter Wu Shishen), as the second half of the year begins, China's national economy has shown new signs of improvement. In July, market prices rose at the lowest rate so far this year, export trade grew at the highest rate so far this year, and the fiscal revenue and expenditure situation showed significant improvement compared to previous months.

    The State Statistical Bureau reported today that in July, the supply of coal, crude oil, and electricity, which were previously in short supply, continued to grow. The production of raw materials such as pig iron, steel, steel products, and chemical raw materials showed signs of recovery, and the production of various daily necessities also grew steadily.

    The concern over market price increases has eased. In July, the price index for living expenses of workers in 35 large and medium-sized cities rose by 17.1% compared to the same month last year, the lowest increase so far this year.

    The sluggish foreign trade in the first half of the year has started to improve. In July, the customs export volume rebounded, with an export value of $44.1 billion, an increase of 14.6% compared to the same month last year.

    Fiscal revenue has increased significantly faster than expenditure. Statistics show that in July, fiscal revenue increased by 12.5% compared to the same month last year, while fiscal expenditure increased by only 3.9%.

    However, there are still many new problems, mainly structural irrationality, market stagnation, increased product backlog, and poor economic benefits.

    物价涨幅回落  财政收支好转
    上月国民经济发展有新转机
    主要问题结构不合理产品积压效益滑坡
    据新华社北京8月21日电　（记者吴士深）步入下半年，我国国民经济发展又出现新的转机：7月份，市场物价是今年以来上涨幅度最小的一个月，出口贸易增长幅度为今年以来最高的，财政收支情况也明显好于前几个月。
    国家统计局今天介绍说，7月份供应偏紧的原煤、原油、发电量保持增长势头，生铁、钢、钢材、化工原料等原材料生产呈回升趋势，各类基本生活用品生产也稳步增长。
    牵动人心的市场物价涨幅继续回落。7月份，35个大中城市职工生活费用价格指数比去年同月上升17.1％，是今年以来涨幅最低的一个月。
    今年上半年不太景气的对外贸易开始好转。7月份，海关出口货物回升，出口额达44.1亿美元，比去年同月增长14.6％。
    财政增收节支，收入增长明显快于支出增长。据统计，7月份财政收入比去年同月增长12.5％，财政支出仅上升3.9％。
    但是目前还存在不少新问题，主要是经济结构不合理、市场疲软、产品积压增多、经济效益差。
