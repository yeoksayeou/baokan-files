The traditional master-apprentice system for traditional Chinese medicine will be restored and developed in Anhui's traditional Chinese medicine community.

The Anhui Provincial Bureau of Traditional Chinese Medicine recently began recruiting 1,000 apprentices across the province. Among them, 50 will be senior apprentices, 310 will be intermediate apprentices, and 640 will be junior apprentices. Those who pass the examination and are admitted can choose their own master, and teachers can also select apprentices from the admitted candidates. Senior apprentices will inherit their teachers' practical experience and unique academic insights, ensuring that some valuable traditional Chinese medicine heritage will have successors. Intermediate apprentices, upon completion, will have specialized skills, enabling them to perform the work of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.

The junior apprentices recruited will primarily be trained to become traditional Chinese medicine practitioners for rural areas.

    安徽恢复中医带徒制度
    据新华社合肥8月15日电（记者郭庆华）我国传统的中医带徒制度将在安徽中医药界重新得到恢复和发展。
    安徽省中医管理局近日起向全省招收中医学徒1000名。其中高等学徒50名、中等学徒310名、初等学徒640名。经考试合格而录取的学徒可以经自己选择拜师，老师也可以从录取人员中选择学徒。高等学徒将老师的实践经验和独到的学术见解继承下来，使一些宝贵的中医医学遗产后继有人。中等学徒出师后将具有专科特长，以便能胜任中医药师的工作。
    所招收的初等学徒，主要是为乡村培养中医药人才。
