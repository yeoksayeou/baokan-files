In the outskirts of Quanzhou, Fujian, there is a scenic area called Beili Mountain. Amidst the flowers and trees, a set of new buildings stands tall: red walls leaning against the mountain, yellow tiles with upturned eaves, a blend of Chinese and Western styles, grand and impressive. At first glance, it seems like the Potala Palace in Lhasa. However, this is not a temple, but a newly established university—Yan'en University! This is a new type of university that integrates teaching, research, and production. The main construction, completed in September 1988, covers over 200 acres and has a total building area of more than 70,000 square meters. Once the entire plan is completed, the total investment will exceed 200 million yuan!

Where does this money come from? It all comes from the school's founder, Mr. Wu Qingxing, a passionate overseas Chinese who dreams of establishing a private school in his hometown.

Mr. Wu is a Thai Chinese, born in Myanmar. For decades, he has traveled abroad for business, accumulating a large amount of capital. However, he has never forgotten his motherland, China, nor his ancestral home in Quanzhou, Fujian. In the dark days of old China, his parents were homeless, seeking livelihood abroad, and gave birth to him in a foreign land, hoping that he would grow up to achieve something, bring glory to his ancestors, and serve China! Mr. Wu firmly remembers his parents' instructions and expectations, always waiting for this day. In the 1950s, he studied in Beijing with the deep affection of a returning son, but the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s shattered his beautiful dreams. By the 1980s, he was already in his sixties, with gray hair and beard, but the reform wind of China called him back like a migrating goose. He first invested in building two oil immersion plants in Northeast China, equipped with fully automated facilities, hoping to contribute to the revitalization of China through modern technology.

In late 1986, he returned to his ancestral home in Quanzhou, established the Yan'en Foundation, and began the arduous task of educating talents. Why is it called "Yan'en"? This name takes one character from each of his parents' names, expressing his remembrance and inheritance of his parents' true feelings of longing for their homeland until their last moments. It also embodies Mr. Wu's own heart: the motherland is like a mother, and no matter where a person goes, they can never forget their mother, and no one can replace their mother. The love for the country and the affection for the mother are forever intertwined in his heart.

The grand and difficult task began. At that time, the Beili Mountain area was still a barren hill, with uneven terrain and a dirty, chaotic environment. Everything had to start from scratch. From leveling the land, laying the foundation, to building the buildings, Mr. Wu personally directed the work. What is particularly commendable is that all the steel, wood, cement, and bricks needed for the construction, Mr. Wu did not use the state's allocated quotas, but purchased them all at market prices, significantly increasing the cost. But for the sake of a long-term plan, he was not afraid to spend more money, only seeking high quality. Even small items like faucets and light bulbs were purchased from the best suppliers in Hong Kong, transported thousands of miles to the construction site. He even personally selected the lunch boxes for the students. For his hometown and Yan'en, he spent money like water, but he lived a very simple life, eating in the cafeteria with everyone, without any special privileges, and his clothes were simple, not even buying high-quality socks. In the past few decades abroad, he had not built a single school for any country. The first school he established was in China! His own son, suffering from a serious illness, was hospitalized for a long time, but he could not stay by his side to take care of him, pouring his heart into building the school and into other people's children!

Two years have passed. Now, the Beili Mountain area has completely changed. The former barren hill has become a place of learning, and the sound of reading fills the earth and sky with life and hope! After the school opened, the first thing Mr. Wu required was for all teachers and students to gather on the playground every morning to raise the national flag and sing the national anthem, singing out the spirit of the Chinese people and the pride of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor!

Currently, Yan'en is temporarily managed by Huaqiao University and is called "Yan'en College." To be on par with world-class universities, Mr. Wu is preparing to make Yan'en independent from Huaqiao University, naming it "Yan'en University," with four colleges, eight departments, three research institutes, and one research center, aiming to make it a top-tier university standing in the East!

    东方情结
    霍达
    在福建泉州城外，有一个风景秀丽的北鲤山区。花木掩映之中，耸立着一片崭新的建筑：红墙倚山而立，黄瓦翘起飞檐，中西合璧，蔚为壮观，初看疑是拉萨的布达拉宫。但这里不是神堂庙宇，却是一所新兴的高等学府——仰恩大学！这是一所集教学、科研、生产为一体的新型大学。1988年9月已完成的主体工程占地200余亩、总建筑面积7万多平方米。待全部计划完工，总投资将超过两亿元！
    这笔钱从哪里来？全部出自学校的创办人吴庆星先生之手，一位一心想在家乡“办义学”的热心肠的华侨！
    吴先生是泰国籍华人，出生于缅甸，几十年来奔波于海外经商，积聚了大量的资本。但是，他始终没有忘记他的故国中华，没有忘记祖居地福建泉州。在黑暗的旧中国，他的父母流离失所，出外谋生，在异国他乡生下了这个儿子，盼望他长大之后能够有所作为，光宗耀祖，报效中华！吴先生牢牢记着父母的嘱咐和期望，一直在等着这一天。在50年代，他曾怀着游子归来的深情在北京上学，但60年代的“文革”风暴又把他美好的憧憬击得粉碎。到了80年代，他已年近花甲，须发斑白，中国改革的春风又呼唤他像大雁一样归来。他先在我国东北投资兴建了两座浸油厂，投进全部自动化设备，热望着靠现代化科技为振兴中华贡献一己之力。
    1986年底，他回到祖居地泉州，设立了仰恩基金会，开始了办学育才的艰苦壮举。为什么要称“仰恩”？这里各取了父母的名字中的一个字，以表达他对两位老人临终念念不忘故国之真情的缅怀与继承，而且也融进了吴先生自己的一颗赤子之心：祖国就是母亲，一个人无论走到哪里，永远也不可能忘了母亲，谁也不可能代替母亲。爱国之心，恋母之情，永远绾在他的心上。
    宏大而艰难的壮举开始了。当时的北鲤山区还是一片荒山野岭，地形凹凸不平，环境脏污杂乱，一切都要从零开始。从开山平地、打地基到兴建楼群，吴先生亲自指挥。尤为可贵的是，建校所需的那么多钢材、木材、水泥、砖石，吴先生没有占用国家的平价调拨指标，全部议价购买，造价大大增加了。但他为了百年大计，不怕多花钱，但求高质量，甚至连自来水龙头、日光灯这种小物件，也从香港购买最好的，千里迢迢运来，而且是自己手提着走出厦门机场，再乘汽车，途经泉州辗转运到工地。连学生用的饭盒也亲自选购。为了家乡，为了仰恩，他挥金如土，但自己却过着极为简朴的生活，和大家一起在食堂就餐，没有给自己任何特权，连他的衣着都简简单单，穿双袜子都舍不得买高级的。在国外几十年，他没给任何一国办过一所学校，他所兴办的第一所学校却是在中国！他自己的儿子因患重病长期住院，他却顾不上陪住、照料，把一颗心扑在办学上，扑在别人的孩子上！
    两年过去了。现在，北鲤山区彻底变了样儿，昔日的荒山变成了学府，琅琅书声给大地和天空注入了生命力，带来了希望！开学后的第一件事，吴先生要求全校师生每天早晨齐集操场，升国旗，唱国歌，唱出中国人的威风来，唱出炎黄子孙的志气来！
    目前，仰恩暂由华侨大学代管，称为“仰恩学院”，为了能和世界名牌大学并驾齐驱，吴先生正准备把仰恩从华侨大学独立出来，称“仰恩大学”，下设4个学院、8个系、3个研究所和1个研究中心，把她办成屹立在世界东方的、第一流的大学！
