The first Women's Weiqi Masters Tournament concluded after seven rounds of intense competition. On the afternoon of the 20th, the final rankings were determined in Beijing. The 24-year-old player from Shanxi, Huang Yan, a five-dan, emerged victorious, defeating several national team players in succession, and secured the championship with a record of 6 wins and 1 loss, taking home the champion's cup—the Welfare Cup. The Japanese women's "Meijin" title holder, Shimao Miyazaki, who came to China for self-funded studies, only managed to secure the seventh place.

Notable players Zhang Xuan, a seven-dan, and Yang Hui, a seven-dan, also had records of 6 wins and 1 loss, but due to the lower rankings of their opponents, they finished in second and third places, respectively. The players ranking fourth to sixth were Hua Xue Ming, a six-dan, Rui Nai Wei, a nine-dan, and Shen Ying, an initial dan.

    首届围棋女子名人赛黄焰夺杯
    本报讯　中国围棋女子名人赛经过7轮争夺，20日下午在北京决出最后名次。24岁的山西选手黄焰五段脱颖而出，连续战胜多名国家队好手，以6胜1负的成绩捧走冠军杯——福利杯。自费来华留学的日本围棋女子“名人”获得者宫崎志摩子二段仅获得第七名。
    著名棋手张旋七段和杨晖七段成绩也是6胜1负，但因对手分较低而分获第二和第三名。居第四至第六位的是华学明六段、芮乃伟九段和沈颖初段。　（纪瑞）
