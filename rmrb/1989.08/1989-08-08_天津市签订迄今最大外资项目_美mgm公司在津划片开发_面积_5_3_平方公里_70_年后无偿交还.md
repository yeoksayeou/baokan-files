Tianjin tonight signed the largest foreign investment project to date in the city. According to the signed contract, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area Land Bureau will lease a 5.3-square-kilometer plot of land to the American MGM Commercial Company for development.

U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley specially came to Tianjin to attend the signing ceremony, and he wished this globally watched project great success.

After two years of intense negotiations, this land, which is being transferred for a fee in accordance with China's constitution and regulations, is adjacent to Tianjin Port and the extension of the Jingjin Tang Expressway into the port. The lease fee is $3.25 per square meter, with a lease term of 70 years. The American MGM Company will collaborate with relevant investors to develop the infrastructure of this land and establish a number of wholly foreign-owned industrial investment projects, with most of the products for export. All projects of foreign-invested enterprises will be approved by the Chinese government and will enjoy all the preferential policies of the development area. It is estimated that foreign investors will invest nearly $3 billion to develop the infrastructure and build projects, and will construct a 211-meter-high, 52-story twin-tower building. After the entire area is completed, the annual output value of this land and its infrastructure can reach 10 billion yuan. The land and infrastructure will be returned to China without charge after 70 years.

MGM Company President and Chairman Malik Poel told reporters: "Despite the events in Beijing, I firmly believe that China's far-sighted open policy will not only continue but also expand."
