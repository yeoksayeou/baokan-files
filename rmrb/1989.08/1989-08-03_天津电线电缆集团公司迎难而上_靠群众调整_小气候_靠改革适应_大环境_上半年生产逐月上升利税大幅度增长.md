Tianjin Cable Group Faces Challenges Head-On
Relying on the Masses to Adjust the "Microclimate"
Relying on Reform to Adapt to the "Macroenvironment"
Production Rises Monthly, Profits and Taxes Increase Significantly

BEIJING, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- When the prospect of a downturn seemed inevitable for Tianjin Cable Group, the company's staff and workers were understandably pessimistic. However, the challenges did not deter them. Starting from reforming the management mechanism, they adapted to market changes and other objective conditions, adjusted the "microclimate" on multiple fronts, and proactively adapted to the "macroenvironment." As a result, they turned the situation around, with production steadily increasing. In the first half of this year, they achieved sales revenue of 123 million yuan and profits and taxes of 25.75 million yuan, representing year-on-year growth of 58.6% and 66.9%, respectively.

The cable industry, often referred to as the "industry of blood vessels," has seen one-third of its larger enterprises incur losses over the past year. Faced with nationwide macro-control, tight resources, materials, and intense competition within the industry, Tianjin Cable Group sought solutions and implemented five key measures:

	— Analyzing market demand to adjust product structure. Through market research, they discovered that not all cable products were oversaturated; some were still in high demand. They decisively reduced the production of products with high material consumption and low profits, increasing the production of oil pump cables by 78.5% and significantly boosting the production of fully plastic power cables. This approach ensured both national needs and good economic benefits.

	— Adopting a dual guidance approach of market and capital to adjust business strategies. To address the capital shortage, they strengthened information work, prioritizing the production of urgently needed products for customers who could pay on time. By early May, they had already exceeded their targets by 20%, reaching 152 million yuan.

	— Streamlining intermediate links to adjust production organization. To meet the requirements of producing multiple varieties in short periods and on demand, they broke away from the old input-output standards, transitioning production commands to high efficiency. The production cycle in the first half of the year was reduced from 40 days to 25 days.

	— Strengthening savings and reducing consumption to enhance enterprise management. The factory decomposed savings targets to the grassroots level, implementing them through contracts. They strictly managed materials, changing the past practice of piling up waste materials into "gold mountains" and "silver mountains." Just in material savings, they achieved over 3.8 million yuan in the first half of the year.

	— Mobilizing the masses to ensure a harmonious atmosphere throughout the factory. The factory proposed the slogan "Thoughts close to the frontline, life privileges for the frontline, emotions connected to the frontline," allocating 25% of floating wages to frontline workers in high-temperature and harsh working conditions. They regularly convened workers' congresses to review the factory's work and the style of the leadership, keeping the workers' spirits high.

    天津电线电缆集团公司迎难而上
    靠群众调整“小气候”  靠改革适应“大环境”
    上半年生产逐月上升利税大幅度增长
    本报天津8月3日电　记者肖荻报道：当年初滑坡几成定局的事实严峻地摆在天津电线电缆集团公司本部面前时，这个公司的干部群众对前景确实不敢乐观。但一个“难”字未能使他们裹足不前。他们从改革经营机制入手，顺应市场等客观条件的变化，多方调整“小气候”，主动适应“大环境”，扭转局面，生产逐月上升，今年上半年实现销售收入1.23亿元，利税2575万元，分别比去年同期增长58.6％和66.9％。
    素称“血管工业”的电线电缆行业，去年以来已有1／3较大厂家出现亏损。在全国加强宏观控制，资金、能源、材料全面紧张，同行业竞争激烈情况下，天津电线电缆集团公司本部寻找对策，“五管”齐下：
    ——分析市场需求，调整产品结构。他们通过调研发现线缆产品并非全面饱和，有的仍很紧俏，就果断压缩耗材多、利润低的产品，将耗材少、利润大、销路好的油泵电缆增产78.5％，并大幅度增产全塑力缆，做到保证国家需要与创造良好效益相结合。
    ——采取市场与资金双导向，调整经营战略。为解决资金短缺这一难题，他们加强信息工作，优先为急需产品并能及时付款的用户安排生产。到5月初已超接任务20％，达1.52亿元。
    ——压缩中间环节，调整生产组织。为适应多品种、短期量、按需生产的要求，打破老的投入产出期量标准，使生产指挥向高效过渡，上半年生产周期由40天压缩到25天。
    ——强化节约降耗，加强企业管理。厂里将节约目标分解到各基层，以承包合同加以落实，严格物资管理，改变了过去废材料堆成“金山”、“银山”的现象，仅材料降耗一项上半年就达380多万元。
    ——调动群众情绪，全厂心齐气顺。工厂提出“思想贴近一线、生活优待一线、感情融通一线”口号，将25％浮动工资全部拨给高温、艰苦作业的一线工人，定期请职代会评审全厂工作和干部作风，职工情绪饱满。
