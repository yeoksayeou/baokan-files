The "Journey Through Ethnic Regions" reporting activity, jointly organized by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and this newspaper, was completed as planned by June this year.

The People's Daily "Journey Through Ethnic Regions" reporter group set out from Beijing on April 20, 1987. At that time, Yang Jingren, then Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, inscribed the following words for this reporting activity: "Reporting to 70 million, facing 1 billion people." Looking back over the past two years, we can say that we have fully realized this requirement.

During the entire "Journey," the People's Daily sent out 10 reporter groups, 40 reporters, and 8 drivers. They traversed the Great Khingan Mountains, crossed the Nujiang Gorge, passed through the Pamir Mountains, and entered the Tibetan Plateau, covering a distance of over 100,000 kilometers. They reported on 55 ethnic minorities in the provinces and autonomous regions of Northeast, Northwest, Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian, Hainan, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, and Tibet, publishing 170 news articles and over 140 photographs, and producing a video documentary.

Organizing such a large number of reporters to continuously and comprehensively report on the political, economic, and cultural developments and changes in ethnic minority regions, reflecting the rich and varied lives of the people of various ethnic groups and the difficulties and problems they face in the reform and opening up, is something that the People's Daily has done for the first time. These reports have been welcomed by ethnic minority cadres and the broad readership and have also attracted widespread social attention.

The practice over the past two years has shown that organizing such reporting activities is significant for promoting the Party's ethnic policies, strengthening ethnic unity, maintaining national unity, and advancing the reform and opening up in ethnic minority regions. Most of China's ethnic minorities live in border areas with inconvenient transportation and limited information. In the process of reform and opening up, they are eager to learn about the outside world, especially those ethnic groups with smaller populations living in high mountains, gorges, and deep forests, who are even more eager for the care of the Party and the government. The reporters' visits and reports have played a role in bridging the gap between the upper and lower levels and between the inside and outside.

This "Journey" reporting has been a comprehensive training for the reporters. The reporters who participated not only endured the unexpected hardships of reporting in urban and rural areas but also greatly broadened their horizons. They have a deeper understanding of the national conditions of our country, which is still in the primary stage of socialism and is multi-ethnic. They have a personal experience of the profound changes in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of ethnic minority regions in recent years and the issues facing the development of ethnic minority regions in the new era, thereby greatly enhancing their sense of mission and responsibility in accelerating the construction of ethnic regions, maintaining ethnic unity, and maintaining social stability.

This "Journey" reporting has also conducted some bold explorations in ethnic news reform, breaking away from the long-standing model of ethnic reporting that "only reports good news." While reporting extensively on the progress and development of ethnic regions, the reporters have also, under the premise of not violating ethnic policies and not hurting ethnic sentiments, criticized backward phenomena and raised some problems in ethnic work that need attention and resolution.

This "Journey" is the beginning of the People's Daily system's reporting on the lives of ethnic minorities. The upcoming "Ethnic Unity and Progress" essay contest is a continuation of "Journey Through Ethnic Regions." We hope that the broad readership will give it enthusiastic support.

The "Journey Through Ethnic Regions" reporting activity over the past two years has received strong support from the relevant provincial and regional party committees, governments, and ethnic affairs commissions, as well as from many enterprises and institutions. It has also received enthusiastic help from local cadres and the masses. We express our heartfelt thanks for this!

    《民族地区纪行》结束语
    由国家民委与本报联合主办的《民族地区纪行》采访活动到今年6月，已按预定计划完成了。
    本报《民族地区纪行》记者组于1987年4月20日从北京出发。当时，全国政协副主席、前国家民委主任杨静仁曾为这次采访活动题词：
  “报道七千万，面向十亿人”。回顾两年多的历程应该说，我们圆满地实现了这一要求。
    在整个《纪行》中，本报先后派出的10个记者组，40名记者和8名司机，穿大兴安岭林区、跨怒江峡谷、过帕米尔雪山、进西藏高原，行程10多万公里，采访了东北、西北、广西、云南、福建、海南、新疆、贵州、四川、湖南、西藏等省区的55个少数民族，发表了170篇通讯、140多幅照片，摄制了一部录像片。
    组织这样多的记者，用这样大量的篇幅，连续地、多侧面地报道少数民族地区政治、经济、文化等方面的发展、变化，反映各兄弟民族人民丰富多采的生活和在改革开放中存在的困难和问题，这在人民日报的历史上还是第一次。这些报道受到了少数民族干部和广大读者的欢迎，也引起了社会的广泛关注。
    两年多的实践证明，组织这样的采访活动，对宣传党的民族政策，加强民族团结，维护祖国统一，推进少数民族地区的改革开放，都有一定的意义。我国少数民族大多居住在边疆地区，交通不便，消息闭塞，在改革开放中，他们渴望了解外界的信息，特别是那些居住在高山峡谷、密林深处的人数较少的民族，更是渴盼党和政府的关怀。记者的采访和报道，恰好起到了上下、内外沟通的作用。
    这次《纪行》采访，对记者来说，是一次多方面的锻炼。参加采访的记者不仅经受了在内地城乡采访所意想不到的艰苦条件的考验，而且大大地开阔了视野，对于我们这个尚处于社会主义初级阶段的、多民族的国家的国情，大家有了进一步的认识，对于近些年来少数民族地区政治、经济、文化方面的深刻变化和新时期少数民族地区发展中面临的课题有了切身的感受，从而大大提高了加速民族地区建设、维护民族团结、维护社会稳定的使命感和责任感。
    这次《纪行》采访报道，对民族新闻改革也进行了一些大胆的探索，对长期以来形成的民族报道“报喜不报忧”的模式有了突破。记者们在大量报道民族地区发展进步的同时，也在不违背民族政策、不伤害民族感情的前提下，批评了落后的现象，提出了一些当前民族工作中值得重视和解决的问题。
    这次《纪行》，是人民日报系统对少数民族生活报道的开端。即将开始的《民族团结进步》征文，是《民族地区纪行》的续篇。希望广大读者能给以热情的支持。
    两年多的《民族地区纪行》采访活动，受到有关省区党委、政府和民委以及不少企事业单位的大力支持，受到当地干部群众的热情帮助，对此，我们表示衷心的感谢！
