    Lin Hanxiong, the Minister of Construction, stated at a conference on urban residential community construction held in Jinan that improving the living conditions of urban residents should be a fundamental national policy.

    In 1978, the per capita living space in urban areas nationwide was only 3.6 square meters, which was even lower than the level at the beginning of the liberation. From 1979 to 1988, the total investment in urban housing construction nationwide reached 218.7 billion yuan, accounting for 85.6% of the total investment in urban housing construction since the founding of the nation; a total of 1.24 billion square meters of new housing was built, accounting for 70% of the total construction since the founding of the nation; by 1988, the per capita living space in urban areas had reached 6.3 square meters. Despite this, the housing situation for urban residents remains quite tense.

    Only when people have a place to live can they work happily. When discussing China's urban housing construction development strategy and its implementation steps, Lin Hanxiong emphasized that the goal of housing development is a system, and we cannot focus only on the average living space while ignoring the disparities between the well-off and the poor. We must "provide aid in times of need" and not "add flowers to brocade." In the next ten years, efforts should be focused on solving the problems of those without housing and those in difficult circumstances.

    林汉雄谈住房建设战略
    今后重点“雪里送炭”
    本报济南8月24日电　记者贾建舟报道：建设部长林汉雄在这里召开的城市住宅小区建设现场会上提出，要把不断改善城市人民的居住条件作为国家发展的基本国策。
    1978年，全国城市人均居住面积仅为3.6平方米，还低于解放初期的水平。1979年至1988年，全国用于城市住宅建设的总投资达2187亿元，占建国以来城镇住宅建设总投资的85.6％；共新建住宅12.4亿平方米，占建国以来建设总量的70％；城市人均居住面积到1988年达6.3平方米。尽管如此，城市人民住房依然相当紧张。
    只有安居，才能乐业。在谈到我国城镇住房建设发展战略及其实施步骤时，林汉雄强调说，住房发展目标是一个体系，不能只看平均居住面积而忽视苦乐不均的矛盾，要“雪里送炭”，不要“锦上添花”。今后十年，要把功夫下在解决无房户和困难户上。
