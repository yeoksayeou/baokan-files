On August 27, 1989, at 16:26 Central European Time, Fang Shengqiang, Shen Hongfei, Xie Yifan, and Xie Jianmin won the gold medal in the men's lightweight four double sculls without coxswain event at the 15th World University Games in Duisburg, Germany. They completed the race in 6 minutes and 39.7 seconds, defeating competitors from the United States, West Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. This was the first time Chinese male rowers had won a gold medal in a major international competition.

That afternoon, the sky was filled with thick clouds, occasionally drizzling with rain, and a chilling north wind made everyone shiver. The finals for the last six rowing events began at 15:00. Excited West German spectators, international rowing officials, and representatives from the host city and the organizing committee had already filled the stands. To be honest, no one had high hopes for the Chinese men's rowing team. Even a few Chinese journalists left the venue after watching the women's races, as the best result the men's team had achieved was an 8th place finish in the single sculls event at the 1985 World Championships in Canada.

At 16:20, six double sculls boats set off, with the Chinese team in the first lane closest to the spectators. From the television broadcast on the podium, it was clear that after the first 500 meters, the Chinese team was in third or fourth place. By the 1000-meter mark, they had moved up to second, just behind the Spanish team. At the 1500-meter mark, they were still closely following the Spanish team. With only 250 meters to go, the four young athletes gave it their all, their movements coordinated and in sync. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, their sleek boat sliced through the water like a sharp knife, crossing the finish line first. From that moment on, China's men's rowing team ended their history of being medal-less in international competitions.

The four athletes clenched their fists and raised their arms in gratitude to the spectators, their faces beaming with excitement. They neatly donned their blue and white training suits, each bowing to receive the precious gold medal, holding the bouquet of flowers, and solemnly watching the five-star red flag rise to the top of the highest flagpole. The president of the International Rowing Federation, Keller, joyfully congratulated the Chinese team on their breakthrough in the men's event.

The four athletes who won the gold medal have an average age of just over 21 years. Apart from Xie Jianmin, who had participated in a competition in Japan, the others were all experiencing an international competition for the first time. The youngest, Shen Hongfei, is only 18 years old and had only competed in two national competitions.

Team leader Liu Aijie told reporters, "This gold medal proves that Chinese men's rowing can also succeed and breaks the monopoly of Europe and America. On the 29th, our rowing team will leave Duisburg for Brod in Yugoslavia to participate in the World Championships. Let's wish them success in reaching even greater heights!"

    劈波斩浪　奋力争先
    ——记中国男子赛艇队夺得首枚金牌
    1989年8月27日，中欧时间16时26分，方善强、沈鸿飞、谢一凡和谢建敏在杜伊斯堡第15届世界大学生运动会的男子轻量级四人双桨无舵赛艇比赛中，以6分39秒7的成绩战胜美国、西德、意大利、西班牙和荷兰选手，荣获冠军。这是我国赛艇男选手第一次在重大国际比赛中夺得金光闪闪的金牌。
    这天下午，天空浓密的乌云不时洒下几滴细雨，一阵阵北风使人打战。赛艇最后6个项目的决赛从15时开始。兴致勃勃的西德观众、国际赛艇界以及本届运动会和杜伊斯堡市政府负责人，早就把观众台挤得满满的。说实在话，大家都没对中国男子赛艇抱什么希望，连几个中国记者也在看过女子比赛后离开了赛场，因为中国男子队以前最好成绩也不过是1985年在加拿大拿了个单人艇的第8名而已。
    16时20分，6条四人双桨艇出发了，中国队排在离观众席最近的第一艇道。从主席台上的电视转播看，前500米划完时，中国队约在第三或第四位；但到1000米处，中国队前进到第二，仅仅落后于西班牙队一点儿；到了1500米处，仍然紧紧咬住西班牙队不放。在离到终点只有250米时，四位小将奋起搏击，他们动作协调，配合默契，在观众一阵高于一阵的热烈掌声鼓励下，尖尖的赛艇像一把锐利的匕首，率先划破终点线的水波——从这一刻起，中国结束了男子赛艇与奖牌无缘的历史。
    四位小将捏紧拳头，高举双臂向观众表示谢意，兴奋之情溢于言表。他们整整齐齐穿好蓝白两色训练服，一一俯身接受那珍贵的金牌，捧着鲜花庄严地注视着五星红旗升到最高一根旗杆的顶端。国际赛艇联合会主席凯勒高兴地祝贺中国队实现了男子项目的突破。
    夺得冠军的四位运动员平均年龄才21岁多，除了谢建敏到日本参加过一次比赛之外，都是第一次经历国际比赛的大场面。最小的沈鸿飞今年才18岁，参加全国比赛也才两次。
    刘爱杰领队对记者说，这个冠军的意义在于证明了中国男子赛艇也行，打破了欧美的垄断。29日，我国赛艇队先期离杜伊斯堡赴南斯拉夫布罗德参加世界锦标赛，让我们祝愿他们再上一层楼！
