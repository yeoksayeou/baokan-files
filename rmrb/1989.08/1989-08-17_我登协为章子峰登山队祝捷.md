The Chinese Mountaineering Association held a celebration today at the Huairou training base on the outskirts of Beijing for the first mainland and Hong Kong joint climbing team that successfully climbed Chapuchan Peak. Certificates were also awarded to the three mainland team members who reached the summit.

The joint climbing team consisted of nine members from the mainland and nine from Hong Kong. After nearly a month of arduous efforts, three members from each side successfully reached the summit of Chapuchan Peak, which stands at 7,543 meters, at 5:55 PM on July 24th. This climbing activity is notable for its compact team, short duration, and the fact that it was led by newcomers.
