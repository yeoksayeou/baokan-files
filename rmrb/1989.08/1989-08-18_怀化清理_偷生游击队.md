The July 29 edition of the People's Daily exposed the "birth evaders" in the suburbs of Huaihua, causing a stir in the city.

According to incomplete statistics from the Huaihua Public Security Bureau, the city currently has 15,000 floating population members. Some of these individuals are engaged in commerce and factory operations, some are involved in sideline businesses, and a portion are purely evading family planning regulations. Since this year, some townships in Huaihua have established teams to investigate and address the "birth evaders" issue, implementing various sterilization procedures and achieving some success. After the exposure of the Huaihua suburban "birth evaders," on August 1, the municipal government convened a meeting with representatives from the Municipal Family Planning Commission, Public Security Bureau, Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Construction Commission, Personnel Bureau, Labor Bureau, Transportation Bureau, Agricultural Machinery Management Station, Financial Commission, and five street offices. The meeting formulated the "Temporary Regulations on the Management of Floating Population Family Planning" and organized a team of 100 people to conduct a comprehensive cleanup of the "birth evaders." For those who have given birth to multiple children and are pregnant again, efforts are made to persuade them to undergo artificial abortions; for those who have given birth to two children, they are encouraged to undergo sterilization; for those who have given birth to multiple children, penalties are imposed according to regulations.

    怀化清理“偷生游击队”
    7月29日《人民日报》披露了怀化城郊的“偷生游击队”事件，在怀化市引起震动。
    据怀化市公安局不完全统计，全市现有外流人员1.5万人，这些人有的是经商办厂的，有的是搞副业的，也有一部分人是纯属躲避计划生育的。今年以来，怀化市部分乡镇已分别成立了本乡镇“偷生游击队”的清查工作队，落实各种节育手术，取得了一定的成绩。怀化城郊“偷生游击队”见报后，8月1日市政府召集市计划生育委员会、公安局、工商局、建委、人事局、劳动局、交通局、农机管理站、财委及五个街道办事处的负责人开会，制定了“关于流动人员计划生育管理的暂行规定”，并组成100人的工作队，对“偷生游击队”进行全面清理。对生育多胎后又怀孕的，设法动员其做人工流产；对已经生育二胎的，动员其做结扎手术；对生育多胎的，按规定进行处罚。
