The White House spokesman, Fitzwater, said today that President Bush would "not rule out" the possibility of capturing the powerful figure in Panama, Noriega, to face trial in the United States for alleged involvement in drug trafficking.

However, Fitzwater said that President Bush does not intend to take this action at present, and that the current U.S. military exercises in Panama are related to this.

Bush said in an interview this week that there is a legal distinction between detaining someone as a hostage and detaining someone for trial. He said that in dealing with Noriega's drug trafficking case, he does not rule out the possibility of extraditing this Panamanian leader to the United States for trial.

The United States has long accused Noriega of involvement in drug trafficking and has proposed that if Noriega steps down, it would withdraw the accusation, but this has been rejected by Noriega.

    美威胁要捉拿诺列加审判
    新华社华盛顿8月11日电  白宫发言人菲茨沃特今天说，布什总统将“不排除”捉拿巴拿马实权人物诺列加到美国接受参与毒品走私审讯的可能。
    但是菲茨沃特说，布什总统并不在打算采取这一行动，目前美国在巴拿马的军事演习与此有关。
    布什在本周接受记者采访时说，扣压某人当作人质与拘留某人接受审讯在法律上是有区别的。他说，在处理诺列加走私毒品案中，他不排除将这位巴拿马领导人引渡到美国接受审讯的可能。
    美国一直指控诺列加参与毒品走私，并提出只要诺列加下台，它将撤回这一控告，但遭到诺列加的拒绝。
