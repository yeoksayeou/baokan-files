The U.S. has changed its strategy on the Panama issue, no longer insisting that Noriega must leave the country.

	New York Times, August 16th, Washington - Today, the U.S. State Department spokesperson, Boucher, stated in response to questions about the U.S.'s policy towards Panama that the U.S.'s goal is to make the Panamanian strongman Noriega relinquish power. Boucher did not mention the U.S.'s previous insistence that Noriega must leave Panama.

	Boucher's remarks reflect an important shift in the U.S.'s strategy on the Panama issue.

	The U.S. government has accused Noriega of involvement in international drug trafficking and has been exerting pressure for him to step down and leave Panama, but has not succeeded.

	A State Department official recently told the New York Times that the U.S. no longer insists that Noriega must leave Panama. The U.S.'s recent demand is that he must relinquish power. The U.S.'s retreat on this demand is aimed at getting the Organization of American States to negotiate and secure Noriega's transfer of power by September 1st.

	Xinhua News Agency, August 16th, Panama - The three-way talks involving the Panamanian government, the ruling party, and the opposition, including the military, concluded on August 16th. Due to significant differences, no substantial progress was made. The ruling party representative, Duke, said at a press conference that the U.S.'s continuous military exercises in Panama not only threaten Panama's sovereignty but also undermine national reconciliation efforts. The opposition representative, Endara, also said that the atmosphere for the three-way talks is being disrupted.

	Since the May elections were declared invalid, the three parties have held several rounds of talks on the issue of power transfer on September 1st, but have made no progress.

### 美在巴拿马问题上策略有变化  不坚持诺列加必须离国

    美在巴拿马问题上策略有变化
    不坚持诺列加必须离国
    新华社华盛顿8月16日电　美国国务院发言人鲍彻今天在回答有关美国对巴拿马政策的问题时表示，美国的目标是使巴拿马实权人物诺列加放弃权力。鲍彻并未提及美国过去所坚持的诺列加必须离开巴拿马。
    鲍彻的这番谈话反映了美国在巴拿马问题上的一个重要策略变化。
    美国政府指责诺列加参与国际毒品走私，一直在施加压力要求诺列加下台并离开巴拿马，但未能如愿以偿。
    国务院一位官员不久前也对《纽约时报》说过，美国现在不再坚持诺列加必须离开巴拿马，美国日前的要求是他必须放弃权力。美国在这一要求上的退步是希望美洲国家组织通过谈判，争取诺列加在9月1日之前移交权力。
    新华社巴拿马8月16日电　巴拿马包括军方在内的政府、执政党和反对党三方对话16日结束，因分歧严重，未取得实质性进展。执政党代表杜克在记者招待会上说，美国连续在巴拿马进行军事演习，不仅危及巴拿马主权，也破坏了全国和解的努力。反对党代表恩达拉也说，三方对话的气氛正在被破坏。
    在5月大选被宣布作废后，三方就9月1日政权交替问题举行几次对话，均无进展。
