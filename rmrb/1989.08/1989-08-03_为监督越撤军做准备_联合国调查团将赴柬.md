The United Nations Secretary-General, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, is dispatching a technical United Nations investigation team to Cambodia. The team's mission is to gather information in preparation for establishing an international monitoring mechanism for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

This was announced today by UN spokesperson Nadia Lonnis. She stated that the team will be led by Major General Martin Wadset, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in the Middle East, and is expected to arrive in the region by the end of this week.

The spokesperson did not disclose the number of team members or their composition.

De Cuéllar's actions are based on the decision made yesterday at the Paris International Conference on Cambodia. The decision indicates acceptance of de Cuéllar's proposal to dispatch a UN investigation team to Cambodia as soon as possible. The Paris Conference called on the four Cambodian factions and relevant countries to provide full cooperation and necessary assistance to the team, enabling it to conduct technical on-site investigations throughout Cambodia.

    为监督越撤军做准备  联合国调查团将赴柬
    本报联合国8月2日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔正在派遣一个技术性的联合国调查团到柬埔寨。其任务是收集一些资料，为建立一个监督越南撤军的国际监督机构做准备。
    这是联合国发言人纳迪亚·龙尼丝今天在这里宣布的。她说，该团由联合国中东停战监督组织参谋长马丁·瓦德塞特中将率领，可望于本周末到达该地区。
    关于调查团的人数和组成情况，发言人没有透露。
    德奎利亚尔的措施是根据柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议昨天的决定而采取的。该决定表明接受了德奎利亚尔提出的尽快向柬埔寨派遣联合国调查团的建议。巴黎会议要求柬埔寨四方和有关国家向调查团提供充分合作和必要帮助，以便该团在柬埔寨全境进行技术性的实地调查工作。
