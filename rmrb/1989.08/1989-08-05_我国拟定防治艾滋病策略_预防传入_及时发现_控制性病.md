    China Formulates AIDS Prevention and Control Strategy
    Preventing Entry, Early Detection, Controlling STDs

    BEIJING, Aug. 5 (People's Daily) -- Health Minister Chen Minzhang said at the National AIDS Prevention Policy Seminar today: "China's current strategy for preventing AIDS is to prevent its entry, detect cases and infected individuals promptly upon entry, control domestic STDs, and prevent the spread of AIDS through sexual contact."

    AIDS is a serious infectious disease discovered in the early 1980s. Currently, 151 countries and regions have reported 167,373 cases. Experts from the World Health Organization estimate that there are 5 to 10 million people worldwide infected with the AIDS virus, of whom 1 million will develop AIDS in the next five years.

    China is one of the countries with the lowest incidence of AIDS. Since the first case of an American tourist with AIDS was discovered in June 1985, a total of three imported cases have been found. By July 27 this year, 26 cases of AIDS virus infection have been detected.

    Chen Minzhang said: "With the increase in international exchanges, preventing and controlling the entry, occurrence, and spread of AIDS has become an important task in public health. It is crucial to further publicize and mobilize the entire society to participate in AIDS prevention activities and implement effective measures."

    Research shows that the main routes of AIDS transmission are: first, through blood, second, from mother to child, and third, through sexual contact. Since most blood products abroad have undergone virus inactivation, China has banned the import of blood products, and blood and mother-to-child transmission of AIDS will not pose a serious threat in China for the time being.

    What is worrisome is the transmission through sexual contact. In recent years, STDs have spread to all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. According to STD monitoring reports from 16 key cities, the STD incidence rate in these regions reached 21.02 per 100,000 in 1987, with some regions reaching 336 per 100,000, already comparable to some Western countries. Therefore, controlling sexually transmitted diseases is the key to preventing and controlling the spread of AIDS in China.

    The Director of the WHO Western Pacific Region, Han Xiangtai, as well as representatives from the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children's Fund, also offered valuable suggestions at the seminar.

    我国拟定防治艾滋病策略
    预防传入　及时发现　控制性病
    本报北京8月5日讯  记者艾笑报道：今天，卫生部部长陈敏章在国家预防艾滋病政策研讨会上说：“我国目前预防艾滋病的策略是预防传入，及时发现传入病例及艾滋病病毒感染者，控制国内性病，防止艾滋病经性接触途径传播。”
    艾滋病是80年代初新发现的一种危害严重的传染病。目前，151个国家和地区已报告病例167373例。世界卫生组织专家估计，全球现有500万至1000万人被艾滋病病毒感染，其中将有100万人在今后的5年内发展为艾滋病患者。
    我国属世界上艾滋病发病最低国家之一，自1985年6月发现第一例患艾滋病的美国旅游者以来，至今共发现3例由国外传入病例。截至今年7月27日，共发现艾滋病病毒感染者26例。
    陈敏章说：“随着我国国际交往的增多，预防和控制艾滋病的传入、发生和蔓延已成为卫生工作的重要任务之一。更深入地宣传动员全社会参与艾滋病预防活动，落实各项有效措施，对我国至关重要。”
    研究表明，艾滋病传播途径主要有三：一是通过血液传播，二是母婴传播，三是性接触传播。由于目前国外大部分血液制品都进行了病毒灭活，我国已禁止血液制品的进口，经血液及母婴传播艾滋病，在我国暂时并不会构成严重威胁。
    值得警惕的是通过性接触传播途径。近年，性病发病已遍及各省、自治区、直辖市。据16个重点城市性病监测报告，1987年，这些地区性病发病率达21.02／10万，其中部分地区已达336／10万，已与西方某些国家水平相同。因此，控制性传播疾病，是我国目前预防、控制艾滋病传播的关键。
    世界卫生组织西太区主任韩相泰，以及联合国开发计划署、联合国儿童基金会代表等都在研讨会上提出了有益的意见。
