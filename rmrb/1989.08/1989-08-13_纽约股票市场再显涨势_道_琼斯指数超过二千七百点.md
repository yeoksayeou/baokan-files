Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 11th.

On August 10th, the New York stock market closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching 2712.63 points. This is the first time in two years that the index has surpassed 2700 points.

On the first trading day of this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2144.64 points. Since then, it has risen by more than 26%. The historical high for this index was 2727.62 points, set on August 25, 1987. After the stock market crash on October 19 of that year, the index fluctuated but has recently shown a surprising upward trend, approaching its historical high. Some experts believe that the index surpassing its historical high is imminent.

From the current situation, the factors driving the rise of the Dow Jones Industrial Average are multifaceted.

From an economic perspective, the U.S. economic situation this year is better than last year: (1) Economic growth has slowed significantly, with the second quarter's annualized GDP growth rate at 1.7%, the lowest since the third quarter of 1986; (2) Consumer growth has slowed, with personal consumption expenditures increasing by only 1.1% in the second quarter; (3) Inflationary pressures have eased, with the second quarter's inflation rate at 5.2%; (4) The fiscal deficit has decreased, with the fiscal deficit for the first nine months of the 1989 fiscal year, up to June, at $106.5 billion, a reduction of 11.6% from the same period last year; (5) The unemployment rate dropped by 0.1% in July, falling to 5.5%. These indicators show that the U.S. economy has shifted from last year's "overheating" but maintains a growth momentum without causing inflationary pressures or leading to economic recession.

For this reason, the U.S. financial policy has shifted from last year's tight monetary policy to a more relaxed stance.

The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates three times in the past two months. Meanwhile, government bond yields have risen slightly. The reduction in interest rates makes investing more profitable, thereby driving stock market transactions.

    纽约股票市场再显涨势
    道·琼斯指数超过二千七百点
    新华社北京8月11日电　（记者黄彭年）8月10日，纽约股票市场收盘时，道·琼斯30种工业股票平均指数达到2712.63点。这是两年来该指数第一次超过2700点。
    今年第一个股票交易日收盘时，道·琼斯30种工业股票平均指数为2144.64点，迄今已上升26％以上。这项指数的历史最高水平是1987年8月25日创造的2727.62点。这一年10月19日股市大暴跌后，这项指数便起落不定，但近期内却显示出令人惊异的回升势头，现已接近历史最高点。一些专家认为，这项指数超过其历史最高点已指日可待了。
    从当前的形势看，促使道·琼斯工业股票指数上扬的因素是多方面的。
    从经济方面看，今年美国的经济形势比去年好：（1）经济增长速度明显放慢，第二季度国民生产年增长率为1.7％，为1986年第三季度以来经济增长速度最低的一个季度；（2）消费增长速度放慢，第二季度的个人消费开支仅增长1.1％；（3）通货膨胀压力减轻，第二季度通货膨胀率为5.2％；（4）财政赤字减少，到6月份为止，1989财政年度头9个月的财政赤字为1065亿美元，比上年度同期减少11.6％。（5）7月份失业率下降0.1％，降到5.5％。这些情况表明，美国的经济既改变了去年的“过热”现象，又保持增长势头，而且不会引起通货膨胀的压力，以至出现经济衰退。
    正因为如此，美国的金融政策今年来已从去年的紧缩转向放宽。
    美国联邦储备委员会近两个月来已三次降低利率。与此同时，政府的债券收益率却有所上升。利率下降，使投资者更加有利可图，从而推动了股票市场的交易。
