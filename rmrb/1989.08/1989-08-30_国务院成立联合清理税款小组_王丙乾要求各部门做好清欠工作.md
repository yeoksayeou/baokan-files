The State Council's Joint Tax Collection and Clearance Group was established in Beijing yesterday. Wang Binyang, Vice Premier and Minister of Finance, serves as the group's leader, with officials from the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and the State Planning Commission serving as deputy leaders.

The group includes officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the State Taxation Administration, the General Administration of Customs, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the China Construction Bank.

The office is located in the Ministry of Finance.

At the group's first full meeting yesterday, Wang Binyang pointed out that the State Council's decision to establish the Joint Tax Collection and Clearance Group is a significant measure taken in response to the increasingly severe problem of tax arrears. This year, enterprise tax arrears have been rising month by month, reaching unprecedented levels, disrupting the normal economic order, hindering the progress of economic rectification, and affecting the completion of the state budget. We must have a correct understanding of the severity of the problem and be fully prepared. The State Council has decided to make the clearance of tax arrears and withheld taxes a key task in current economic work.

Wang Binyang emphasized that it is both necessary and significant to focus on clearing tax arrears at present: First, by addressing the issue of triangular debts and clearing up the taxes owed to the state, we can help untangle the knots in economic life, stimulate economic activity, and restore normal economic order. Second, it can help alleviate the current fiscal tension. Third, it is beneficial for enterprises to strengthen their management, use funds effectively, adhere to financial discipline, and strengthen tax management. Fourth, it can help straighten out the relationships between the state, enterprises, and financial institutions, and clarify the channels for funds.

He urged leaders of various departments to prioritize this work, organize and implement it seriously; respect each other, cooperate actively; divide labor reasonably, leverage departmental strengths, and do a thorough job of clearing arrears; make good plans, and ensure the work is carried out effectively; and follow the overall situation, strictly implement state laws and regulations.

He stressed that at present, it is particularly important to control the increase of new tax arrears while clearing existing ones. We must not clear old arrears while accumulating new ones, where the amount of new arrears exceeds the amount cleared.

    国务院成立联合清理税款小组
    王丙乾要求各部门做好清欠工作
    新华社北京8月30日电　国务院联合清理拖欠税款领导小组昨天在北京成立，国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾任组长，财政部、中国人民银行、国家计委的负责人任副组长。
    这个小组成员包括经贸部、国家税务局、海关总署、工商银行、中国银行、农业银行、建设银行的负责人。
    办公室设在财政部。
    在这个小组昨天召开的第一次全体会议上，王丙乾指出，国务院决定成立国务院联合清理税款小组，是针对当前欠税现象日益严重的情况所采取的一项重要措施。今年以来，企业欠税逐月上升数额越来越大，这种情况是多年来没有过的，已影响到经济生活的正常秩序，影响到治理整顿的进行，影响到国家预算的完成。我们一定要对问题的严重性有一个正确的认识，有足够的估计。国务院决定，要把清理拖欠和占压税款作为当前经济工作的一项重要工作来抓。
    王丙乾指出，当前，集中精力抓清理拖欠税款的工作不仅非常必要，而且意义重大：一是通过清理三角债解决企业之间相互拖欠入手，把欠交国家的税款清理上交，有利于解开经济生活中的疙瘩，搞活经济，恢复正常的经济生活。二是可以缓解当前财政收支紧张的矛盾。三是有利于企业加强经营管理，管好用活资金，严肃财经纪律，强化税收管理。四是可以促进国家与企业、财政银行等多方面的资金关系的理顺，分清资金渠道。
    他要求各部门领导把这项工作排入重要议事日程，认真组织落实；相互尊重，主动配合；合理分工，发挥部门优势，深入细致地做好清欠工作；制定好计划，把工作落到实处；服从全局，严格执行国家的法令和规章制度。
    他强调，当前需要特别注意的是在清理已有欠税的同时，严格控制新欠税款的增加。不要一边清理老欠，一边增加新欠，增加的比清理的还多，越清欠交越多。
