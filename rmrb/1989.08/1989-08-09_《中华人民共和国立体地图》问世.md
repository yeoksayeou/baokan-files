The "People's Republic of China 3D Map," which integrates cartography, sculpture, and artistic decoration, has recently been unveiled in Xi'an.

The 3D map has a width of 4.3 meters from east to west and a height of 2.5 meters from south to north. The entire map, based on the three-dimensional terrain, uses a layered coloring method. From low to high, it uses colors such as blue, green, yellow, brown, and orange to represent the terrain features of the seabed, plains, plateaus, and mountains, vividly and intuitively displaying the natural landscape and the distribution patterns of social and economic elements across the country. The map marks the names of major residential areas, transportation networks, borders, water systems, mountain ranges, peaks, basins, islands, and forest areas. It also uses lights and symbols to highlight revolutionary memorial sites, cultural relics, tourist attractions, and famous geographical landmarks.
