	Distance in the Heart
	Li Chunhua

	“Distance in the heart is inversely proportional to physical distance, because there are forces of attraction and repulsion!” It seems that some philosopher said this.

	A small station, newly built, very small, by the Bohai Sea.

	I was traveling alone by ship from Dalian to Beijing and got off at Tanggu. I thought transportation here would be very convenient, but now hundreds of people are crowded into three limited buses. I was at a loss.

	Wait, patiently looking left and right. Oh, the two people in front are waving at me. I remember, they are two people from Dalian who came with me on the same ship. “Didn’t you get on?” I smiled bitterly and shrugged.

	“Come with us to take the ‘minibus,’ we’ll pay!” I shook my head, “No, thank you!” I pulled my small suitcase in front of me tightly. One of them seemed to twitch his face, and they left.

	I finally managed to squeeze onto a public bus. I felt very tired.

	“Miss, you sit here!” It was them again! I sat there apologetically and thanked them. The one whose face had twitched earlier said, “A little more sincerity, a little less suspicion, and life would be much simpler…”

	I looked out the window and said, “Suspicion is very natural, because there is a repulsive force between people, so there is a great distance in the heart…”

	“That belongs to the realm of physics, not necessarily in the world of emotions!” The tall young man next to me interrupted my words.

	Silence. The car crawled like an ox on the Tianjin coastal road. Outside the window was a neat field, green trees, and bright sunshine. It was very hot. It was the end of July, a summer full of green.

	The two people from Dalian got off the bus. I smiled sincerely and said goodbye to them. They only waved their hands lightly, “Thank you for your sincere smile…”

	I fell silent again, thinking about their words. The young man next to me spoke, “Is this your first time in Tianjin? Just you alone?”

	I nodded, “I’m passing through to Beijing. This bus is really hard to get on!” I complained.

	Just then, the car broke down. We had to wait.

	I stood very close to the stranger. I was silent, pulling my small suitcase closer to me; he was also silent, frowning as he looked at the distant willow trees.

	Finally, the car came, seeming like it had been a century. I was still sitting while he was standing. I seemed to hear his heart beating steadily.

	Finally, I heard him tell a story in a low, deep voice: “The sky is vast and the grasslands are endless.” It was about his vacation internship and interview: on the vast grasslands where “the wind blows the grass low and the cattle and sheep are visible,” each Mongolian tent was like a pearl, scattered far apart. But when you trek across the endless desert, starving and thirsty, no matter which Mongolian tent you reach, the owner will warmly offer you a large bowl of milk tea and small pastries. If you are sick and stay for a few days, the male owner will definitely slaughter a sheep for you…

	My thoughts drifted—

	A southbound train, a girl singing song after song for a seriously ill stranger, though her voice was not very good, it was full of deep affection…

	A bustling street, a deep and kind voice telling you the location and route to Beihai Park and the Great Wall…

	A very small and warm dormitory for seven people, by your sickbed, sweet oranges, hot milk, and soft bread…

	“Get off here, I have to go do something—our family needs to buy a refrigerator, I’ll go pay first. You wait here!” The boy left, and I got off the bus. In the nameless station, I looked at a tree full of green phoenix trees.

	I didn’t want to wait anymore, already knowing the route, so I took another bus to the train station and left, leaving an empty small station, without thanking him, without saying goodbye.

	There weren’t many people at the train station, and I was waiting for the train to Beijing.

	I walked towards the ticket gate, and a hand lightly helped me lift the suitcase. I turned my head, I was startled, and we looked at each other. “Why didn’t you wait for me? I was really afraid you would go the wrong way!”

	We still didn’t say much, just walked very close together.

	Indeed, we were very close. It’s true that close objects have repulsive forces. But our hearts, our bare sincerity and that longing for sincerity, were very close, very warm and harmonious. There was never a moment like this. “Actually, the world is simple, it’s just that people are too complicated!” “If there is more sincerity, more trust, the world will still be simple!” Finally, a smile without gloom, full of sunshine, bloomed on our faces. We looked at each other, smiled, felt the harmony of our hearts, felt the warmth of the sunshine.

	The train left, and I waved goodbye to him as he gradually disappeared. Goodbye, small station, goodbye, friend! We don’t know each other’s names, don’t know each other’s experiences, only met briefly at the small station, and then waved goodbye. Perhaps we will never meet again in the four seas, but the attraction of the heart, the selfless sincerity, will cross space, surpass the magnetic field, and tightly bind us together, calling for the day when the sea will turn the desert blue…

    心距
    李春华
    “心距与距离成反比，因为存在着引力和斥力！”似乎哪位哲人这样说过。
    小站，新建成，很小，在渤海边。
    我独自一人乘船从大连回北京，于塘沽下船。原以为这里交通十分方便，可现在好几百人挤三辆有限的汽车，我茫然了。
    等，耐心地左顾右盼。哦，前边两个人冲我招手，想起来了，是同船共济而来的两个去北京出差的大连人。“你也没搭上？”我苦笑着耸耸肩。
    “跟我们一块儿去乘‘小巴’吧，我们出钱！”我摇摇头，“不，谢谢！”紧紧地拉了拉脚前的小皮箱。其中的一个脸上似乎抽搐了一下，他们走了。
    我好不容易挤上一辆公共汽车。我感到很累很累。
    “小姐，你坐这吧！”又是他们两个！我歉然地坐在那里，向他们道谢。那个刚才脸上抽搐的人说：“多一点真诚，少一点戒意，生活就简单多了……”
    我向窗外望着，说道：“戒意是很自然的，因为人与人之间存在着斥力，因而彼此是有很大心距的……”
    “那属于物理学范畴问题，不一定存在于感情世界！”我身边的一位高个男孩子打断了我的话。
    沉默。车像一条牛，爬在津滨公路上。窗外是整齐的田野，绿色的树，阳光很灿烂。天很热。是7月末的一天。一个充满绿意的夏天。
    两位大连人下车了。我真诚地微笑着与他们告别。他们只淡淡地挥了挥手，“谢谢你这真诚的笑！”……
    我再度沉默，思索着他们的话。身旁的男孩子说话了：“第一次来天津？就你一个人？”我点点头，“我是顺路回北京，这车真难坐！”我抱怨了一句。
    恰在这时，不争气的车抛锚了。我们只好等。
    我与那位陌生的男孩子相距很近地站着。我又沉默，沉默中把小皮箱提近我；他也沉默，皱着眉头看远处柳丝绵长的树。
    车终于来了，似乎过了一个世纪。依然是我坐着他站着。我似乎听见他的心咚咚地很沉稳地跳着。
    终于，我听见他用一个低缓深沉的声音讲一个“天苍苍野茫茫”的故事。那是他假期实习采访：在那“风吹草低见牛羊”的大草原上，每个蒙古包都像一颗颗珍珠似地分布着，相距很远。但当你跋涉在无边的大沙漠上，饥渴至极时，无论你走到哪一个蒙古包前，主人都会热情地为你端出大碗的奶茶、小面点，如果你病了住下几天，男主人一定要为你宰一只羊……
    我的心绪飘飞了——
    一列急驰南下的火车，一位少女为病重的陌生者唱了一首又一首歌，尽管音质不十分好，却满含了深情……
    熙熙攘攘的街头，一个深沉慈祥的声音告诉你北海、长城的位置、路线……很小很暖住了7个人的宿舍里，在你的病床前，一个个甘甜的桔子，一杯杯滚烫的牛奶，一个个软软的面包……
    “在这下车吧，我去办点事——我们家要买冰箱，我先去交钱。你在这里等我！”那孩子走了，我下了车，在无名小站里，看一树绿绿的梧桐。
    我不想再等了，已经知道了路线，于是我搭另一辆去火车站的汽车，走了，留下一个空空的小站，没有谢他，没有说再见。
    火车站人不很多，我在等去北京的火车。
    我向检票口走去，一只手轻轻地帮我提起了皮箱。我侧头，我惊愕，我们相互对视着。“你怎么不等我？我真怕你走错了方向！”
    我们仍然不多说话，只是很近地并肩走着。
    的确，我们相距很近。相近的物体有斥力，也没错。但我们的心距，我们裸露的真诚的感情和那份向往真诚的期望却很近很近。没有一刻这样近，这样温暖和谐。“其实世界很简单，只是人太复杂了！”“如果多一分真诚，多一分信任，世界仍然是简单的！”终于一丝没有阴郁，充满阳光的微笑在我们彼此的脸上绽开了，我们相视着，微笑着，感应着心的和谐，感应着阳光的温暖。
    火车走了，我向渐渐远去的他挥挥手。再见了小站，再见了朋友！我们不知彼此的姓名，不知彼此的经历，只在小站匆匆相遇，又匆匆挥手，也许四海之内再无缘相见，但心的引力、无私的真诚却跨过空间，超越磁场，紧紧地把我们系在一起，召唤着大海把沙漠染蓝的那一天……
