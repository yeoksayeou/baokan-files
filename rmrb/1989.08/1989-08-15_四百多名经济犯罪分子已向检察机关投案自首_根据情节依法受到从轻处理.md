    Over 400 Economic Crime Suspects Have Surrendered to Procuratorial Authorities
    Received Lenient Treatment According to Law Based on Circumstances

    BEIJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) — From January to June this year, procuratorial authorities at all levels across the country accepted 440 individuals who surrendered themselves for embezzlement and bribery crimes. Among them, 249 were embezzlers and 191 were bribe-takers, with a total of 6.51 million yuan in illicit funds recovered.

    It is understood that these individuals who surrendered themselves for embezzlement and bribery crimes are mostly from the financial, construction, grain, supply and materials sectors, often holding real power over finances and materials. Their embezzlement and bribery amounts are generally large. It is known that factory directors, managers, financial personnel, procurement staff, and salespersons account for 72% of the total number of surrenders.

    Officials from the Supreme People's Procuratorate analyzed that the motives for these embezzlers and bribe-takers to surrender themselves are varied. Some are genuinely repentant and surrender under the influence of policy; some are deterred by the power of public reports and realize that only by surrendering can they find a way out; some surrender after being persuaded by friends and family; and some surrender under the strong offensive of local procuratorial authorities.

    A cashier from the planning and financial department of the China Zhujiang Building Materials Enterprise in Shenzhen, carrying over 40,000 yuan in illicit funds, surrendered to the municipal procuratorate and said: "The strong voice of public reports is frightening. After embezzling this money, I haven't had a single day of peace, truly living in constant fear."

    In early this year, the People's Procuratorate of Yushu County in Jilin Province held a meeting in the county's grain system, calling on the public to report and persuading those with illegal and criminal behaviors to surrender. After the meeting, 29 people surrendered and confessed to their illegal acts of accepting bribes.

    For those who surrendered, procuratorial authorities at all levels have strictly implemented the policy of "leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist," and have thoroughly investigated the facts. Based on different circumstances, they have made legal decisions to give lenient treatment.

    四百多名经济犯罪分子已向检察机关投案自首
    根据情节依法受到从轻处理
    本报北京八月十五日讯　全国各级人民检察机关今年一至六月份，共接受投案自首的贪污、受贿犯罪分子四百四十人，其中贪污者二百四十九人，受贿者一百九十一人，共收到上缴赃款六百五十一万元。
    据介绍，这些投案自首的贪污、受贿犯罪分子多为金融、建筑、粮食、供销、物资系统的，往往掌管财物实权，其贪污、受贿数额均较大。据了解，厂长、经理、财会人员、采购员、营业员占投案自首者总数的百分之七十二。
    最高人民检察院有关人士分析，促使这些贪污、受贿犯罪分子投案自首的动因是多种多样的，有的是在政策的感召下，真心悔过而投案的；有的慑于群众举报的威力，认识到只有自首才有出路；有的是在亲友的规劝下坦白交代的；也有的是在各地检察机关强大攻势下而投案的。
    深圳市中国珠江建材企业公司计划财务部一个会计携带四万多元赃款向市检察院投案自首时说：“举报强大声威令人畏惧，我贪污了这笔款后，一天也没安稳过，真是惶惶不可终日”。
    吉林省榆树县人民检察院今年初在县粮食系统召开大会，号召群众举报，规劝有违法犯罪行为的人投案自首，会后即有二十九人投案自首，分别交代了他们收受贿赂的不法行为。
    对投案自首者，各地检察机关认真贯彻执行“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的政策，并查清事实，根据不同情节，分别依法作出从轻处理。
