The recent meeting of the directors of the Mongolian Language and Literature Offices from eight provinces and autonomous regions, including Inner Mongolia and Liaoning, revealed that the compilation of ancient texts from northern ethnic minorities in China has made rapid progress and achieved remarkable results.

This work began in 1985. So far, the compiled and published ancient texts include 14 types of documents totaling 42 volumes, with approximately 14.7 million characters. Additionally, 45 types of various ancient texts totaling 37 volumes, with about 19.95 million characters, are scheduled for publication. Among these texts, the three volumes of "Qingshi Lu" with 2.1 million characters, and the "Jangar" translated from the Tote Mongolian script into traditional Mongolian script, are rare ancient texts with significant historical and literary value.
