Shanghai Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry has been focusing on strengthening the institutional building of cadres. They have addressed the four issues most concerning and sensitive to the masses: the clean governance of the bureau, overseas trips by leaders of enterprises and public institutions, salary promotions, and housing allocation. They have further improved management measures and issued relevant regulations to all grassroots enterprises, ensuring that factory directors and managers have clear standards to follow and that the 250,000 employees of the bureau can conduct democratic supervision with solid evidence.

The bureau first started with its own offices, drafting the "Regulations on Maintaining Integrity by Office Staff" at the beginning of this year. The regulations stipulate that all staff members are not allowed to engage in business, use their power to obtain scarce commodities, accept gifts, or eat at subsidized rates when visiting grassroots units.

So far, more than 20 people in the entire office have voluntarily turned in various gifts and vouchers. Many enterprises, following the bureau's lead, have also formulated regulations for the integrity of cadres.

In some enterprises under this bureau, the salary promotions of leading cadres are decided by themselves, with excessive increases and large increments, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The bureau promptly formulated regulations on the approval management of salary promotions for enterprise leading cadres, clearly stating that the salary promotion plans of enterprise leading cadres must be discussed and approved by the joint meeting of the enterprise congress and reported to the higher authorities for approval.

These measures by the Shanghai Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry have been welcomed by the employees. Under the difficult conditions of this year, with tight funds, energy, and raw materials, the cadres and employees of the entire bureau have shared weal and woe, and have done their best to improve production.

In June, the bureau not only made up for the losses caused by the turmoil but also created a new record for the highest monthly output in history. In the first half of the year, the bureau achieved growth in total output value, profits, and foreign exchange earnings.

    上海机电局强化干部管理制度
    厂长经理行有规范职工群众监督有据
    本报上海8月27日电　记者刘士安报道：上海市机电工业管理局注重强化干部制度建设。他们针对当前群众最关心、最敏感的局机关廉政、企事业单位领导干部出国、工资晋级和住房分配四个问题，进一步完善管理措施，并将有关制度全部下发至各基层企业，既使厂长经理行有规范，又保证了全局25万职工进行有根有据的民主监督。
    这个局首先从局机关本身入手，今年初制订了“机关工作人员保持廉洁的规定”，规定所有工作人员不得经商，不得以权谋私批紧俏商品条子，不得收受礼品，下基层用餐按规定付费等。
    到目前为止，全机关已有20多人次主动上交了各种礼品礼券。许多企业在局机关带动下，纷纷制订了干部廉政规定。
    在这个局，有的企业领导干部工资晋级由自己决定，工资增长过多幅度过大，引起群众不满。局里及时制订了关于企业领导干部工资晋级审批管理的规定，明确企业领导干部的工资晋级方案，必须经企业职代会联席会议讨论通过，并报上级部门审批。
    上海市机电局的这些做法，受到职工群众的欢迎。在今年资金、能源、原材料紧张的困难条件下，全局的干部群众同甘共苦，千方百计搞好生产。
    6月份，这个局不仅抢回了因动乱造成的损失，而且创造了月产值历史同期的最高水平。全局上半年实现了总产值、利润和出口创汇三增长。
