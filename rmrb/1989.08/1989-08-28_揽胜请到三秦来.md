Shaanxi Province, located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, is one of the cradles of the Chinese nation. It is situated in the heart of the country, with magnificent landscapes, a long history, a rich culture, and a developing economy. "Qinzhong has been an imperial state since ancient times." Xi'an and its surrounding areas have been the capital of thirteen dynasties and four peasant regimes, totaling 1,291 years. Yan'an was the base area where the Communist Party of China led the people in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The spirit of Yan'an shines upon the world, and the heroic deeds shake the heavens and the earth.

In the past decade, Shaanxi Province's tourism industry has entered a period of rapid development. According to statistics, by 1988, the province had received more than 360,000 overseas tourists, earning 210 million yuan in foreign exchange, which is 13.38 times and 68.85 times the figures of 1979, respectively. From 1978 to 1988, the province received a total of 1.65 million overseas tourists, earning 740 million US dollars.

Shaanxi and Xi'an are known as a "natural history museum." It is rich in cultural relics, with over 2 million precious artifacts, the most of any province in the country. The province has formed eight different tourism areas centered around Xi'an. Xi'an has become a world-famous tourist destination. Walking through the land of Sanqin, one can appreciate the brilliance of Chinese civilization and the beauty of the country's landscapes: Mount Li is so beautiful, Mount Hua is so steep, and Mount Tai Bai is so majestic; the hot springs of Huaqing Pool are pleasant, the waves are calm like a mirror, and there is a soft and charming beauty; the Yellow River's Hukou Waterfall roars with waves splitting the shore, swallowing the universe, and exuding a strong and fierce spirit; the "Lantian Ape Man" from 500,000 to 600,000 years ago, the "Banpo Site" from over 6,000 years ago, and the 5,000-year-old ancestral tomb of the Yellow Emperor are so ancient and profound, inspiring reverence; the bronze artifacts of Zhouyuan, the rare treasures of the underground palace of Famen Temple, are so exquisite and magnificent; the majestic Great and Small Wild Goose Pagodas and the Xi'an City Wall make one linger and forget to leave; the Stele Forest, which collects the essence of calligraphy from all dynasties, is breathtaking; the grand Han and Tang imperial tombs and the mighty Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang are awe-inspiring and praiseworthy...

The Terracotta Army Museum, known as the "Eighth Wonder of the World," has received tens of millions of domestic and foreign tourists in recent years. In the more than half a year since the completion of the first phase of Famen Temple, it has received over 1.5 million domestic and foreign tourists. The Yaozhou Kiln Site Exhibition Hall has been completed, and the key national project, Shaanxi Provincial Museum, has started construction. The modern Xianyang International Airport and the Xi'an to Lintong Expressway are under construction. Currently, there are more than 20 travel agencies and 20 international hotels in Xi'an.

This year's World Tourism Day activities will be held in Xi'an on September 27. At that time, new tourism projects with innovative ideas and local characteristics will be launched, including the opening of the Terracotta Army Pit 3, the Famen Temple—Zhouyuan—Qianling West Line tour, the Xi'an City Wall tour, the Qin Royal Palace tour, and the Shaanxi Folk Art performance. Treasures will shine brightly, come to Sanqin to enjoy the scenery!

    朱晓悦　孟西安
    位于黄河中游的陕西省，是中华民族的发祥地之一。她地处祖国内腹，是一块山川壮美、历史悠久、文化繁荣、经济发展的土地。“秦中自古帝王州”，西安及其附近，共有十三个王朝和四个农民政权在此建都，历时一千二百九十一年。延安又是中国共产党领导人民抗日战争、解放战争的根据地。延安精神光照人间，英雄业绩撼天动地。
    近十年来，陕西省的旅游事业进入大发展时期。据统计，到一九八八年，全省接待海外旅游者已达三十六万多人，旅游收入二亿一千多万元外汇人民币，分别比一九七九年增长十三点三八倍和六十八点八五倍。一九七八年至一九八八年，全省共接待海外游客一百六十五万人次，收入达七点四亿美元。
  　陕西和西安，被誉为“天然历史博物馆”。她文物荟萃，珍贵文物达二百多万件，可谓全国各省之最。全省形成了以西安为中心的八个不同内容和风格的旅游区。西安已成为世界著名的旅游热点城市。漫步三秦大地，可以领略华夏文明之光、祖国山川之美：骊山何其秀、华山何其峻、太白何其雄；华清池温泉宜人，波平如镜，一片阴柔妩媚之美；黄河壶口瀑布惊涛裂岸，气吞环宇，一派阳刚强悍之气；五六十万年前的“蓝田猿人”、六千多年前的“半坡遗址”以及五千年中华始祖轩辕黄帝陵是那样的古朴深奥、令人敬仰；周原青铜器、扶风法门寺地宫的罕世瑰宝又是那么的珍奇精美、华丽辉煌；巍峨雄峙的大、小雁塔和西安城墙，令人流连忘返；集历代书法之大成的碑林石刻，令人叹为观止；气势宏伟的汉唐七十二座帝王陵墓和威武雄壮的秦兵马俑军阵，更是令人惊心动魄，赞叹不已……
    被称为“世界第八奇迹”的秦始皇兵马俑博物馆，近年来已接待国内外游客人数千万人次。法门寺一期建设工程竣工开放半年多时间里，已接待国内外游客一百五十多万人。耀州窑遗址展览馆已经建成，国家重点项目陕西省博物馆已破土动工，现代化的咸阳国际机场和西安至临潼高速公路正在抓紧建设。目前在西安的旅行社已有二十多家、涉外旅游饭店有二十座。
    今年世界旅游日活动将于九月二十七日在西安举行，届时将推出秦兵马俑三号坑开馆、法门寺——周原——乾陵西线旅游、西安城墙游览、秦王宫皇宫旅游、陕西民间艺术表演等富有新意和地方特色的旅游新项目。瑰宝灿烂放光彩，揽胜请到三秦来！
