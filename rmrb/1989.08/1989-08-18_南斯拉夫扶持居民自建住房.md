Yugoslavia adopts a policy of combining public housing construction with encouraging private housing, achieving remarkable results in housing construction. Statistics show that from 1953 to the present, nearly 4 million housing units have been built, with per capita housing area exceeding 17 square meters. To accelerate housing construction, Yugoslavia emphasizes housing reform, with the main direction being to reduce public housing construction and increase private housing. Through the development of forms such as resident self-built public assistance or self-purchased public assistance, the goal of achieving one room per person for each family is gradually realized.

Taking the largest republic in Yugoslavia, Serbia, as an example. The new housing relationship law approved by the parliament in May this year stipulates that starting from September, except for special circumstances, various enterprises and institutions will stop constructing and allocating public housing. Residents generally need to rely on their own funds to build or buy houses, and the government will provide support through preferential policies.

For example, the original law stipulates that residents who have not yet reached the reasonable standard (one room per person, each room not less than 8 square meters) when building or buying houses need to have 35% of the house price, and the remaining 65% can be borrowed from the bank, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and at the same time bear the full amount of loan preservation. Now the new law stipulates that residents only need to have 20% of the house price (if the funds are from the sale of foreign exchange, it can be reduced to 15%), and the remaining costs can all be borrowed from the bank, with the term extended to 40 years, the annual interest rate reduced to 2%, and residents only bear 70% of the loan preservation amount. Families with three or more children can also be exempted from paying interest. The new law also stipulates that when families with housing shortages build and purchase housing within reasonable standards, all the required building materials are exempt from tax. The government also plans to gradually exclude the land foundation and municipal public facilities construction costs, which account for 40-50% of the house price, from the house price.

At the same time, residents who continue to live in public housing must pay 5% of the market housing price within 5 years, which is equivalent to purchasing 5% of the property rights, and at the latest by 1992, all implement "economic rent," raising the annual rent to 2.5% of the construction cost, of which 1% is used for house maintenance and 1.5% as depreciation. After 66 years, when the house price is fully depreciated, the housing belongs to the residents. Enterprises and institutions can use the above income and the proceeds from the sale of public housing as funds for loans to employees who build and buy their own houses.

To facilitate residents in building and buying their own houses, the government also approves them to establish various cooperative housing societies of a mutual aid nature. The cooperative societies, according to the unified municipal construction planning, raise funds for residents, find land, purchase building materials, organize design and construction. The work of the cooperative societies is all service-oriented, not allowed to form income and profits, and the government does not levy taxes. The cooperative societies only collect 3% of the house price as business activity and administrative management fees. Residents can entrust the cooperative societies to complete the entire housing construction work, or only complete the foundation structure construction, and then decorate the interior according to their own preferences, or even build by themselves (mostly in rural areas) after the cooperative societies have prepared the land and materials, to reduce construction costs. Through the cooperative societies, the construction is on average 30% cheaper and the time is shortened by half, so it is very popular among residents. Currently, Yugoslavia has more than 530 cooperative housing societies with 550,000 members. The number of private houses built and bought by residents with public assistance has accounted for more than 65% of the total housing. In Belgrade, the vast majority of new housing is built or purchased by residents themselves.

    南斯拉夫扶持居民自建住房

    南斯拉夫采取公家建房与鼓励私人建房并重的方针，在住宅建设方面取得可观的成就。据统计1953年至今共建造近400万套住宅，人均住房面积超过17平方米。为了加快住宅建设，南强调住房改革，主要方向是减少公家建房，增加私有住房，通过发展居民自建公助或自购公助的形式逐步实现每个家庭1人1室的目标。
    以南斯拉夫最大的共和国塞尔维亚为例。今年5月议会批准出台的新住宅关系法规定，从9月起，除特殊情况外，各企事业单位停止建造和分配公有住宅，居民一般要靠自己的资金建、购房屋，政府将以优惠政策给予支持。
    例如原来的法律规定，还没有达到合理标准（每人1室，每室不小于8平方米）的缺房居民建房、购房时，居民本人需具备房价35％的资金，余下的65％可向银行贷款，年利率为6％，同时还要承担贷款保值的全部数额。如今新法律规定居民只要具备房价20％的资金（如是出售外汇所得的资金还可减少到15％）其余的费用均可向银行贷款，期限延长到40年，年利率减少到2％，居民只承担70％的贷款保值额，有3个以上孩子的家庭还可免付利息。新的法律还规定，缺房户建造和购买合理标准内的住房时，所需建筑材料全部免税。政府还计划把占房价40—50％的地基整理和市政公共设施建设费用逐步从房价中剔除。
    与此同时，继续住公房的居民必须在5年内支付住房市场价格5％的资金，实际上等于购买5％的产权，并且最迟至1992年全部实行“经济房租”，把年房租提高到造价的2.5％，其中1％用来维修房屋，1.5％作为折旧费，满66年房价折旧完时，住房归住户所有。企事业单位可把上述收入和出售公房款作为给自建自购住宅的职工贷款的资金来源。
    为了便于居民自建自购住宅，南政府还批准他们建立各种互助性质的住宅合作社。合作社按照统一的市政建设规划，为居民筹集资金、寻找地皮、采购建筑材料、组织设计和施工。合作社的工作都是服务性的，不准形成收入和利润，政府也不征税。合作社仅收取占房价3％的资金作为业务活动和行政管理费。居民可委托合作社完成住宅的全部建设工作，也可以只完成基础结构建造，然后由自己按照本人爱好进行内部装修，甚至也可以由合作社准备好地皮和材料后，自己建造（大多指农村），以减少建造费用。通过合作社建房平均便宜30％，时间缩短一半，因此深受居民欢迎。目前南斯拉夫共有530多个住宅合作社，55万社员。居民在公助下自建自购的私房数已占住房总数的65％以上。在贝尔格莱德新出现的住房绝大部分是由居民自己出资建造或购买的。
