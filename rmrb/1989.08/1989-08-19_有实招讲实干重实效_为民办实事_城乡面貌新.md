Practical Measures, Real Work, and Effective Results: Improving Urban and Rural Appearances for the People

Doing practical things for the people is a key feature of the work of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government.

Practical measures have improved people's lives. In the past, due to the influence of the "Left," people's lives were not given the importance they deserved, and there were many historical debts. Coupled with the damage caused by the earthquake, people faced many difficulties. In recent years, through practical measures, 33 million square meters of new housing have been built, allowing a million residents to move into new homes; "three-level pit" houses and some dilapidated houses have been renovated, improving the living conditions of 100,000 households; a large-scale housing exchange program has been carried out, reducing commuting time for more than 200,000 households of workers. With the increase in public transportation routes and vehicles, the problem of "difficulty in taking public transportation" has been alleviated; the number of hospital beds has been increased and home hospital beds have been set up, initially solving the problem of "difficulty in hospitalization"; a large number of public toilets have been built in streets and alleys, and people no longer complain about "difficulty in finding a toilet."

Practical measures have changed the urban landscape. In the past, Tianjin had old buildings, messy streets, and dirt everywhere. In recent years, Tianjin has demolished temporary and illegal buildings, renovated more than 100 streets, and restored some architectural landmarks. At the same time, ancient buildings such as the Jixian Ancient Great Wall have been repaired, adding cultural value to the city. A number of parks, green spaces, and hundreds of courtyard-style green areas have been built, eliminating the "three black dragons" (referring to pollution issues), improving environmental quality, and beautifying the urban landscape.

Practical measures have improved urban functions. In recent years, Tianjin has brought in water from the Lu River, expanded waterworks, built and updated some drainage pipes, and enhanced water supply and drainage capabilities. New and expanded telephone exchanges have been built, and direct calls to domestic and international regions have been opened. The inner ring road, middle ring road, outer ring road, and fourteen radial roads have been built, fundamentally improving traffic conditions. The completion of the Jizhuangzi Wastewater Treatment Plant has treated one-third of Tianjin's industrial wastewater, with nearly 100 million tons of water irrigating farmland each year. The realization of gasification has fundamentally changed Tianjin's fuel structure. All of these have enhanced the capacity of the urban carrier, creating conditions for further adapting to the new situation of reform and opening up and economic construction.

Practical measures have boosted the morale of the people. Because the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government insist on saying less and doing more, the people's spirits have been greatly boosted. Tens of thousands of people have participated in the voluntary labor to build Tianjin, and the people have become the masters of doing practical things. In urban construction, relocation is the most difficult task. In the past, it took 100 people to mobilize one household, but now it is a matter of one call and a hundred responses. As long as construction is needed, the people actively support it.

The new Tianjin Railway Station has a total construction area of 62,674 square meters, with significantly improved functions. The old station could only handle 46 pairs of passenger trains per day, with a waiting room that could accommodate 1,350 people; while the new station can handle 95 pairs of trains per day, with a waiting room that can accommodate more than 10,000 people.

### 有实招讲实干重实效  为民办实事　城乡面貌新

    有实招讲实干重实效
    为民办实事　城乡面貌新
    为人民办实事是天津市委、市政府抓工作的一个重要特点。
    办实事改善了人民生活。过去，由于“左”的影响，人民生活一直没有摆上应有的位置，历史欠账很多，加上地震破坏，群众生活中存在许多困难。近几年来，通过办实事，新建了3300万平方米住宅，使百万居民迁入新居；改造了“三级跳坑”房和部分危简陋房，使10万户居民改善了居住条件；开展了大规模的换房活动，使20多万户职工缩短了上下班在途时间。随着公共交通线路和车辆的增加，使“乘车难”得到缓解；增加医院病床和开设家庭病床，初步解决了“住院难”；一大批公厕在大街小巷建成，群众不再喊“入厕难”了。
    办实事改变了城市面貌。过去的天津，建筑破旧，街道杂乱，污迹随处可见。几年来，天津下力量拆除了临建和大量违章建筑，整修了100多条街道，使一些艺术风貌建筑重现光彩。同时，修复了蓟县古长城等一批古建筑，增添了城市的文化价值。修建了一批公园、绿地和几百个庭院式绿化小区，消灭了黄、白、黑三条“巨龙”，提高了环境质量，美化了城市面貌。
    办实事完善了城市功能。这几年，天津引来了滦河水，扩建了自来水厂，建设和更新了一些排水管道，增强了给排水能力。新建扩建了电话局，开通了国内外一些地区的直通电话。修建了内环线、中环线、外环线和十四条放射线，从根本上改善了交通状况。纪庄子污水处理厂的建成，使天津1／3的工业废水得到处理，每年有近1亿吨水灌溉农田。煤气化的实现，从根本上改变了天津的燃料结构。所有这些，都使城市这个载体提高了能量，为进一步适应改革开放和经济建设的新形势创造了条件。
    办实事鼓舞了群众士气。由于天津市委、市政府坚持少说空话、多办实事，使群众精神为之振奋。几十万人参加了建设天津的义务劳动，群众成了办实事的主人。城市建设中拆迁是一件最难的事，过去是百人动员一户，现在是一呼百应。只要建设需要，群众就积极支持。
