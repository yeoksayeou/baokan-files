	They Love China
	– A Record of the Famous Czech Sinologists, the Hrdlička Couple
	Jiǎng Chéngjùn

	“They are of high moral character, have profound knowledge, enjoy hosting guests, and love China…” I often hear my compatriots praise Věra and Zdeněk Hrdlička this way. When I left my alma mater, Charles University, 28 years ago and returned to Prague this April, I had the fortune to meet these two, who are older than me by a generation. I was warmly received and greatly assisted by them, and I truly respect and love them from the bottom of my heart.

	Hrdlička’s Chinese name is He Deli, which was given to him by Comrade Guo Moruo. He was born in 1919, and Věra was born five years later. In their young hearts, a seed of love for China was planted, and they were very interested in our ancient, civilized, and somewhat mysterious China. Thus, in 1941, they began studying Chinese language and Chinese and Japanese cultural history at Charles University in Prague, becoming the first batch of students of the old sinologist, Pražák. In 1946, they transferred to Harvard University in the United States to continue their studies and successively obtained their doctoral degrees.

	For more than half a century, the couple has been diligent and hardworking, becoming the most famous sinologists in Czechoslovakia after Pražák.

	They worked in diplomacy in the Far East for 25 years, starting in 1950 at the Czechoslovak embassy in China, and later transferring to Japan. During their 14 years in China, they made many friends. Guo Moruo, Guo Baquan, and Zhou Dihuan were all their close friends.

	In addition to their busy diplomatic work, they have written and published 20 books. Works like “A History of Chinese Literature” and “On Ancient Chinese Literature” have received high praise. Additionally, they have translated more than 10 Chinese and Japanese literary classics and more than 60 Chinese and Japanese films and television dramas.

	They have wide-ranging interests and are multi-talented. Besides teaching Chinese at prestigious universities such as Charles University, New York University, and Budapest University, and cultivating batch after batch of sinologists, they also have a deep understanding of Chinese horticulture, especially the art of bonsai. The “Bonsai Club” in Czechoslovakia was founded by them. Dr. He Deli told me that they will visit the Jiangnan region this year to further revise their book “Chinese Bonsai Art.”

	They are the founders of the magazine “New Orient” and are also first-rate photographers. Among the more than 400 photographs they took in China, many have won awards after being published domestically and internationally, and they have held multiple photography exhibitions. These photographs have become a major source of illustrations for books and periodicals related to China published in Czechoslovakia.

	They are also famous collectors of Chinese artifacts in Czechoslovakia. They saved money to buy many Chinese art treasures, taking them back to their country for touring exhibitions to satisfy the curiosity of their countrymen.

	Now, the Hrdlička couple are not only the founders and initiators of various associations, societies, and foundations related to Eastern culture in their country; they are also international sinologists.

	They have always steadfastly loved China, spared no effort in promoting Chinese culture, and diligently cultivated generation after generation of disseminators of Chinese civilization.

    他们热爱中国
    ——记捷著名汉学家何德理夫妇
    蒋承俊
    “他俩品德高尚、学识渊博、喜好宾客、热爱中国……”我常听到我的同胞们这般赞美薇娜和兹丹涅克·赫德里奇卡夫妇。当我离开我的母校——查理大学28年后，于今年4月重返布拉格时，有幸与长我一辈的他俩结识，并受到热情款待、鼎力相助，我打心眼里崇敬和热爱他们。
    赫德里奇卡的中国名字叫何德理，是郭沫若同志为他取的。1919年他来到人间，薇娜要比他晚5年。在他们幼小的心灵里就播下了一颗爱中国的种子，对我们这个古老而又文明且有点神秘的中国颇感兴趣。于是1941年便开始在布拉格查理大学攻读汉语和中国、日本文化史，成为老汉学家普实克的第一批弟子。1946年他俩转至美国哈佛大学继续深造，先后获博士学位。
    半个多世纪以来，夫妇俩始终兢兢业业、辛勤耕耘，成为继普实克之后捷克斯洛伐克当代最著名的汉学家。
    他们在远东从事外交工作达25年之久，1950年开始在捷驻华使馆任外交官，后转至日本。在中国的14年里，他们广交朋友，郭老、戈宝权、邹荻帆等都是他们的至友。
    在繁忙的外交工作之余，他们还著书立说20部。像《中国文学史》、《论中国古代文学》等都获好评。此外还翻译了10多部中、日文学名著和60多部中、日电影、电视剧。
    他俩兴趣广泛，多才多艺。除了在查理大学、纽约大学、布达佩斯大学等一些名牌大学教授汉语，培养了一批又一批的汉学人才外，他们还对中国的园林学也颇有研究，特别是盆栽艺术。捷克斯洛伐克的“盆栽俱乐部”就是他俩创建的。何德理博士告诉我，他们今年还要去江南一带造访，为他们的《中国盆栽艺术》一书作进一步修改。
    他俩是《新东方》杂志的创始人，还称得上是一流的摄影家。在中国拍摄的400多幅照片中有多幅在国内外发表后获奖，多次举办摄影展览。这些照片成为捷克斯洛伐克出版的与中国有关的书刊插图主要来源之一。
    他俩也是捷有名的中国文物搜藏家。他们省吃俭用，购买了许多中国的艺术珍品，携回国进行巡回展出，以饱国人的眼福。
    现在，何德理夫妇不仅是国内一些与东方文化有关的学会、协会、基金会的发起人、奠基者；而且是国际汉学家。
    他们始终坚贞不渝地爱着中国、不遗余力地传播着中国文化、辛勤地培育一代又一代中国文明的传播者。
