The Party Committee of Xi'an Jiaotong University has, during the new semester's political education for students, emphasized the importance of avoiding superficial and perfunctory approaches. Instead, they have organized party and administrative cadres, as well as teachers, to engage in thorough and detailed ideological and political work among the students, achieving good results.

The university's more than 10,000 students left the school amid the turmoil, carrying various doubts and confusions. After the school reopened on August 14, the Party Committee decided to use the first four weeks of the new semester to supplement political education alongside catch-up business courses. Initially, some students had a passive and resistant attitude, thinking they just needed to endure it for a while. Some teachers also felt that student ideological work was difficult and that getting by was enough. In response to this situation, the Party Committee believed that doing a good job in student ideological and political work required going deep into the students' lives, providing timely guidance, and helping students change their thoughts, feelings, and stance.

Starting from August 14, 13 school-level party and administrative leaders, along with over a thousand teachers and cadres, went to more than 300 undergraduate and graduate classes. They used lectures, guidance, discussions, and individual conversations to study and reflect with the students. Su Zhuang, the original Party Committee Secretary, who is over 80 years old and joined the revolution during the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, volunteered to go to the Mechanical Engineering Department. He had several discussions with the students, patiently answering their various questions. Professor Yu Lunyuan from the Electrical Engineering Department, who has a disability, comes to the students every day in his wheelchair to help them find resources and provide guidance. Many teachers who have returned from abroad also used their personal experiences to help students clarify their confused ideas about democracy, freedom, and human rights.

The teachers' patient guidance and inspiration made the students feel approachable and trustworthy. Many students reflected on their behavior during the turmoil, examined their actions, and analyzed their weaknesses. A student who made some mistakes during the turmoil said with regret: "As young students, the last thing we want is for our political enthusiasm to be exploited by those with ulterior motives. But in the face of undeniable facts, I finally painfully realized that a few bad people did exploit us, and our actions caused serious damage to the Party and the people's cause. Looking back, the most fundamental issue is that we lacked immunity to the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization, leading to confusion in our political direction."

A student wrote in his application to join the Party after the study session: "We often consider ourselves 'special citizens,' thinking that reading a few books makes us extraordinary. In reality, we have many fatal weaknesses: emotionally, we are impulsive and lack reason; politically, we are naive but think we are mature; we claim to be open to new things but often cannot distinguish between right and wrong. Thus, at this critical moment concerning the life and death of the Party and the country, we wavered in our political stance."

    耐心启发诱导　澄清模糊认识
    西安交大帮助学生转变思想
    本报西安8月23日电　西安交通大学党委在新学期对学生进行政治教育过程中，注意防止大呼隆、走过场，“雨过地皮湿”，组织党政干部和广大教师，到学生中做深入细致的思想政治工作，取得良好效果。
    该校万余名学生，是在动乱中带着种种思想疑虑与困惑离开学校的。8月14日提前开学后，校党委决定新学期用4周时间，在进行补业务课的同时，首先补好政治教育这一课。开始，有些学生思想上有消极抵触情绪，认为硬着头皮顶一阵子，就过去了，一些教师也认为学生思想工作难做，能对付过去也就算了。针对这种现象，校党委认为，做好学生的思想政治工作，要深入到学生中间去，要下及时雨，点点滴滴润心田，真正帮助学生转变思想，转变感情，转变立场。
    从14日开始，学校13名校级党政领导和上千名教师干部分别下到300多个本科生、研究生班级。他们采用宣讲、辅导、讨论和个别交谈等方式和同学们一起学习和思考。80高龄的原党委书记苏庄同志，是抗战初期投身革命的老一代知识分子，他主动请缨下到机械系，先后和几个班同学座谈，耐心地回答大家提出的各种问题。电机系于轮元教授腿有残疾，每天坐轮椅准时来到学生中间，为同学们找资料、做辅导。不少从国外回来的教师还以亲身体会帮助同学们澄清在民主、自由、人权等问题上的模糊认识。
    教师们的耐心启发和诱导，使学生们感到可亲、可信。许多学生回顾动乱中的表现，反思自己的言行，剖析自己的弱点。一位在动乱中做了一些错事的同学不无懊悔地说：“作为青年学生，我们最不希望发生的事是自己的政治热情被别有用心的人利用。但在无可辩驳的事实面前，我终于痛心地认识到，确有极少数坏人利用了我们，我们的所做所为给党和人民的事业造成了严重的损失。回想起来，最根本的一点是对资产阶级自由化思潮的侵蚀缺少免疫力，以致在政治方向上产生了迷误。”一位同学在学习结束时给党组织的入党申请书中这样写道：“我们常以‘特殊公民’自居，自以为读了几本书就很了不起，其实我们有许多致命的弱点：感情上盲目冲动而缺乏理智，政治上幼稚却自认为成熟，自诩为乐于接受新事物却常常不辨真伪，以至在这场关乎党和国家生死存亡的关键时刻动摇了政治立场。”
