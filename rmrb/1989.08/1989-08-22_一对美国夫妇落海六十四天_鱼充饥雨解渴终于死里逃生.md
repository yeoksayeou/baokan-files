A Costa Rican naval patrol boat rescued an American couple who had been adrift at sea for 64 days on August 20. The couple was found 13 nautical miles off the coast of Punta Burica in the Pacific Ocean.

The couple, 61-year-old William Abbott and 52-year-old Simone Marilard, had set sail from Miami, Florida, in early May, bound for Hawaii. However, their journey took a dramatic turn on June 15 when their sailboat was struck and sunk by a pod of whales in the Pacific. Since then, the couple had been drifting on a small rubber raft, surviving on rainwater and small fish.

    一对美国夫妇落海六十四天  鱼充饥雨解渴终于死里逃生
    新华社圣何塞8月21日电　哥斯达黎加一艘海军巡逻艇20日在距太平洋沿岸的布里卡角13海里处救起了一对在汪洋中落难漂流了64天的美国夫妇。
    这对夫妇是61岁的威廉·阿博特和52岁的西蒙娜·玛里尔德。他们于5月初驾驶帆船离开美国迈阿密驶往夏威夷。但是天有不测风云，6月15日，帆船在太平洋中被一群鲸撞沉。此后，这对死里逃生的夫妇便一直乘坐小橡皮艇在茫茫大海上随波逐流，仅靠雨水和小鱼维持生命。
