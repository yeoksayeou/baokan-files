Macau has discovered its first AIDS patient.

The patient is a 37-year-old French man who has resided in Macau for 10 years and works at an entertainment venue. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the 10th due to a bacterial infection in the brain, which caused inflammation and swelling, leading to aphasia and an inability to stand. The initial diagnosis suggested he was an AIDS carrier. After further blood tests, it was confirmed that the patient has AIDS.

The Macau Health Department issued a notice on the afternoon of the 11th, reminding citizens to adhere to the preventive measures for AIDS that were announced in 1987.
