Mother

The skill of mother braiding straw ropes
Was perhaps learned in her youth when she braided hair
Her movements of braiding straw ropes
Are as graceful as when she braids hair
The fence in the courtyard is woven with straw ropes
The cucumber trellis is tied with straw ropes
The young melons are bound with straw ropes
Even in winter, mother
Wears a straw rope around her waist

When mother braids straw ropes
She always sings long ballads
Singing the moonlight bright and shiny
Singing the children's eyes round and bright
Dipped in mountain dew
Sprinkling starlight all day long
Mother uses the humble straw ropes
To tie up the hopes of a farming family
The courtyard will not fall apart
The days will not be dim

    母亲
    （外一首）
    陈太顺
    母亲搓草绳的手艺
    兴许是在她年轻编辫子时就学
      会了
    她0搓草绳的动作
    就和她编辫子一样优美
    小院的篱笆是草绳编织的
    黄瓜架是草绳牵联的
    黄芽白是草绳捆扎的
    便在冬天  母亲
    也在腰里系一根草绳
    母亲搓草绳时
    总是唱长长的歌谣
    把月光唱得铮亮铮亮
    把孩子的眼睛唱得铮圆铮圆
    蘸着山珠
    甩满一天星光
    母亲用不起眼的草绳
    捆住一个农家的希望
    小院不会松散
    日子不会暗淡
