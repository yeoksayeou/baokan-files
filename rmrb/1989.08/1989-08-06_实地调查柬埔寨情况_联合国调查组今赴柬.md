A United Nations investigation team led by Major General Martin Weedset is scheduled to arrive in Cambodia today.

The investigation team will depart for Cambodia on August 7 to gather information and will submit a report to the ministerial-level meeting on the Cambodian issue scheduled to be held in Paris at the end of August.

Weedset told Xinhua News Agency that the mission of the investigation team is to collect intelligence for the ministerial-level meeting at the end of August, so that the ministers will have a clearer understanding when discussing the overall situation in Cambodia.

He said, "This investigation can be said to be related to the establishment of an international supervisory body," and "It mainly focuses on administrative and military supplies, of course, there are also other matters." However, he refused to disclose more details.

Weedset also said that members of the investigation team will conduct research with relevant parties in Thailand before going to Cambodia, but Thai personnel will not participate in any activities of the team.

This is the first investigation team sent by the United Nations to Cambodia since Vietnam's invasion at the end of 1978. The team was dispatched in accordance with the decision of the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue and is part of the international community's efforts to seek a political solution to the Cambodian issue.

Members of the United Nations investigation team come from Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Iran, France, Jamaica, Malaysia, Norway, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The team will operate within Cambodia for 8 to 9 days.

    实地调查柬埔寨情况
    联合国调查组今赴柬
    新华社曼谷8月6日电　（记者马胜荣）由马丁·韦德塞特中将率领的联合国赴柬埔寨实地调查组今天到达曼谷。
    调查组将于7日转赴柬埔寨调查有关情况，于8月底向在巴黎召开的柬埔寨问题国际会议部长级会议提出报告。
    韦德塞特对新华社记者说，调查组的任务就是为8月底召开的部长级会议收集情报，使部长们在讨论柬埔寨整个局势时心中更有底。
    他说：“这次调查可以说同建立国际监督机构有关，”“主要集中在行政和军事供给方面，当然也还有其他方面的事情。”但是，他拒绝透露更多的细节。
    韦德塞特还说，调查组成员在赴柬埔寨前将同泰国有关方面进行研究，但泰国人将不参加小组的任何活动。
    这是自越南1978年年底入侵柬埔寨之后，联合国向柬埔寨派遣的第一个调查组。这个调查组是根据讨论柬埔寨问题的巴黎国际会议的决定派遣的，是国际社会寻求政治解决柬埔寨问题所做努力的一部分。
    联合国调查组的成员来自澳大利亚、加拿大、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、法国、牙买加、马来西亚、挪威、波兰和英国。这个调查组将在柬埔寨境内活动8天至9天。
