    Shanghai's major hotels are beginning to show signs of recovery. The 34 hotels that were the first to receive star ratings have an average room occupancy rate of 40.7%. Among them, the Hengshan and Jinjiang hotel groups, both located in the city center, have room occupancy rates of 85.9% and 71.8% respectively, approaching the levels seen before the turmoil.

    In early July, the Shanghai branch of China International Travel Service (CITS) invited representatives from nearly 10 overseas branches in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore to China for a tourism environment inspection. The general manager of Jinjiang Tourism Company and his team traveled to Hong Kong for business contacts to attract more guests. Additionally, Shanghai's business tourism is also recovering. The Shanghai branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade is currently finalizing plans for more than ten large-scale exhibitions scheduled for the second half of the year. Each of these events is expected to attract a significant number of overseas businesspeople.
