According to a report from the Helsinki newspaper in Finland, this autumn, the number of vehicles using lead-free gasoline in Finland will significantly increase, with an average of one out of every three cars using this type of fuel.

The Finnish government decided in December last year that, to reduce the pollution of exhaust emissions from cars on the air, especially in urban areas, the import and production of low-octane gasoline will be banned starting from September 1st of this year.

Lead-free gasoline causes very little air pollution and is cheaper than the various types of gasoline currently in use. To encourage car owners to use lead-free gasoline, the government has stipulated that vehicles using lead-free gasoline will enjoy tax reductions for the first two years. This alone can save car owners 5,500 Finnish marks (approximately 1,400 US dollars).

Finland is a country with highly developed road transportation and logistics. With a population of less than 5 million, the country has a total of 1.8 million cars and other types of vehicles. Road passenger and freight transport account for more than three-quarters of the total transport volume.

    减少污染  节省开支
    芬兰使用无铅汽油车辆
    据芬兰赫尔辛基报纸报道，今年秋天，芬兰使用无铅汽油的各种车辆将急剧增加，平均每3辆汽车中就有1辆使用这种燃料。
    芬兰政府去年12月决定，为了减少汽车排放的废气对空气、特别是对城市空气的污染，从今年9月1日开始，禁止进口和生产低辛烷汽油。
    无铅汽油这种燃料对空气的污染甚少，且价格比目前的各种型号的汽油便宜。为了鼓励车主们使用无铅汽油，政府规定使用无铅汽油车辆在头2年内可享受减税待遇。仅此一项，车主可节省开支5500芬兰马克（约合1400美元）。
    芬兰是一个公路交通和运输十分发达的国家。
    全国人口不足500万，拥有小汽车和其它各种车辆共180万辆。公路客运和货运量占整个运输量的四分之三以上。
