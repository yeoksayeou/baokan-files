Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 3rd.

A gambling game using glass balls as the gambling tool has begun to spread in Jinan. Some scenic spots shaded by green trees have recently become noisy gambling dens in the evenings.

According to the reporter's observations over several days, this gambling activity is becoming increasingly popular. In the city area, both the upper and lower parts of Yingxiong Mountain, the surroundings of the "August 1st" Flyover, and the banks of the encircling river, all become occupied by gambling stalls after 6:30 PM.

Most of the stall operators are young men and women in their twenties and thirties. According to informed sources, most of these individuals have regular jobs, and setting up gambling stalls is merely their "second job" during their free time. They can earn 10 to 20 yuan in just three or four hours. These individuals place some small prizes like cigarettes, alcohol, and toys on the gambling stalls to lure people in. Some curious onlookers, seeing others win, can't help but try their luck, only to end up losing money. Some people, after winning small prizes, want to win bigger ones, only to end up "losing both the wife and the money."

This gambling game attracts a large number of people who go out for a stroll in the evening. Some ignorant children also become targets for the stall operators. The colorful small toys on the stalls tempt children to part with their pocket money, and these stall operators shamelessly take the money from the children's small hands. Some stall operators even bring their own children to set up gambling stalls.

Some people think that these small-scale "games" are just spending money for fun, a form of entertainment. However, enlightened individuals believe that gambling disguised as entertainment is seriously polluting social customs and is a major public nuisance that must be resolutely eradicated.

    济南蔓延赌博风
    有关人士呼吁扫除此公害
    新华社济南8月3日电　（记者刘伟华）一种用玻璃球做赌具的赌博游戏在济南开始蔓延。一些绿荫遮蔽的风景点，最近每到傍晚时分，便成了闹哄哄的赌场。
    据记者连续几天的观察，这种赌博活动正日益盛行。市区的英雄山上下、“八一”立交桥周围、环城河岸边，每晚6点半以后，都被这种赌摊占去大片地方。
    设摊者多是二三十岁的青年，其中不少是女性。据知情人透露，这些人绝大部分有正当职业，摆摊设赌只是闲暇时间的“第二职业”，出摊三四个小时就能白捞10块到20块钱。这些人在赌摊摆一些烟、酒、玩具等小奖品，诱人上钩。一些好奇者看到有人得了便宜，忍不住要试试手气，结果输了钱；一些人得了小便宜还想得大便宜，结果“赔了夫人又折兵”。
    这种赌博游戏吸引了大批外出乘凉的人，一些无知的少儿也成了出摊者争取的对象。赌摊上花花绿绿的小玩具，引诱孩子将身上的零花钱乖乖地掏出来，而这些摊主竟然心安理得地从稚嫩的小手中接过这些钱。还有的摊主带着自己的孩子设赌。
    有人以为这些小打小闹的“游戏”，无非是花钱买“乐”，权当一种消遣。但有识之士认为，打着消遣幌子的赌博方式招摇于世，已经严重污染了社会风气，实是一大公害，必须坚决取缔。
