Sergei Alekseevich Voronin (1913–) is a Soviet Russian writer. He comes from a family of clerks. He has worked as a lathe operator, railway surveyor, journalist, and magazine editor. He joined the Communist Party in 1947.

Voronin began publishing short stories in 1942 with "In the Rear," and his works are prolific. He has written the novels "On One's Own Land" and "Two Destinies," the novella "Unwanted Glory," and other works such as "Mogobi," "New Romantic Episodes," "Birds Don't Love Their Old Nest," and "Gentle People," as well as a large number of short stories. Additionally, he has written film scripts, children's story collections, and fairy tales. His works have a wide international influence and have been translated into more than thirty languages. He has received the Soviet Gorky Literature Prize, the Soviet State Prize, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, the Order of Honor, and the Order of the October Revolution.

Voronin is first and foremost known as a master of the short story. Soviet critic V. Krechetov wrote: "It is not an exaggeration to say that contemporary short stories are unimaginable without Voronin's works." Voronin follows Chekhov and carries on the excellent tradition of Russian short stories. He excels in psychological descriptions, exploring the spiritual world of contemporary people and their moral character in life, delving into the inner workings of characters. In the writer's mind, life is not always shrouded in a romantic glow. He is particularly concerned with the fate of honest, ordinary people, singing praises to their noble virtues and humanity. If their lives are difficult, if their happiness is damaged by the cruelty of the world, he sympathizes with them. He often criticizes those who are mediocre, selfish, and heartless, those who have lost their love and become cold and unfeeling, pursuing fame and fortune. His works have no contrived characters, no fabricated conflicts. Sometimes the stories seem plain, the narration smooth, but in the end, they often push the plot to a climax, while also leaving the reader with a broad space for independent thought. He presents various facts to the reader, including all "praise" and "criticism" facts. He can find the spark of virtue in the most ordinary people, capture the eternal truths of life from the ever-changing phenomena of life, and display the rich and diverse spiritual world of his contemporaries. Therefore, his works can move readers and inspire deep thought.

Voronin's novels often deal with themes of marriage, love, and morality, realistically exposing the contradictions between urban and rural areas and the sharp conflicts between two generations in ethics and morality. He pays attention to the psychological analysis of characters, and in terms of content, he is full of deep sympathy for the unfortunate, passionate praise for truth, goodness, and beauty, and strong criticism of falsehood, evil, and ugliness. His works are structured tightly, with simple language, rich life atmosphere, and full of emotional color.

    苏联当代短篇小说大师沃罗宁
    黎华
    谢尔盖·阿列克谢耶维奇·沃罗宁（一九一三——），苏联俄罗斯作家。出身于职员家庭。当过车工、铁路勘测人员、新闻记者、杂志编辑。一九四七年加入共产党。
    沃罗宁从一九四二年开始发表短篇小说《在后方》，其著作丰硕，写有长篇小说《在自己的土地上》、《两种命运》，中篇小说成名作《不需要的荣誉》以及《木戈比》、《新浪漫主义情节》、《小鸟不恋故巢》、《温顺的人》等，以及大量的短篇小说。此外，还著有电影剧本、儿童故事集、童话集等。他的作品有广泛的国际影响，已译成三十多种文字。他曾获苏联高尔基文学奖、苏联国家奖金、劳动红旗勋章、荣誉勋章、十月革命勋章。
    沃罗宁首先是作为短篇小说家而名闻遐迩的。苏联评论家维·克列切托夫撰文说：“可以毫不夸张地说，没有沃罗宁的创作，当代短篇小说是难以想象的。”沃罗宁师法契诃夫，继承了俄罗斯短篇小说的优秀传统。他擅长心理描写，探索当代人的精神世界和他们在生活中的道德情操，挖掘人物的内心活动。在作家的心目中，生活并不总是笼罩着富于浪漫色彩的光环。他异常关注诚实、平凡的人们的命运，歌颂他们崇高的品德和人性，如果他们生活坎坷，如果他们的幸福被人间的冷酷所损害，他就对他们寄予同情。他常常在作品里抨击那些浑浑噩噩、自私自利的庸人，那些丧失爱心并变得冷漠无情、只知追名逐利的人。他作品中没有矫揉造作的人物，没有编造的冲突，有时似乎故事平淡，叙述平缓，但最后往往把情节推向尖锐化，同时又给读者留下独立思考的广阔空间。他在读者面前展示出互不相同的各种事实，包括所有的“褒”和“贬”的事实。他能从最默默无闻的普通人身上发现美德的闪光，从瞬息万变的生活现象中捕捉到永恒的人生真谛，展示同时代人丰富多样的广阔精神世界。所以他的作品能够打动读者，引人深思。
    沃罗宁的小说多以婚姻、爱情、道德为题材，比较真实地揭露了城乡矛盾和两代人在伦理道德上的尖锐冲突，注意人物的心理剖析，在思想内容上充满了对不幸者的深切同情、对真善美的热情讴歌、对假恶丑的有力挞伐；作品结构严谨，语言朴实，生活气息浓郁，富有感情色彩。
