The New China has been born for 40 years. Along with the steps of the motherland's progress, the people of Henan have gone through an extraordinary journey.

The diligent and simple people of Zhongyuan have, with their wisdom and intelligence, created the splendid culture of the Chinese nation and made great contributions to the progress of human civilization. However, for the past two thousand years, the people have never changed their status and fate of being oppressed, enslaved, and exploited, and until the eve of liberation, they were still struggling on the brink of starvation. It was only with the birth of New China that they truly took control of their own destiny. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Zhongyuan have walked the socialist path, using their hardworking hands to create a beautiful new life, bringing about a historic change in the appearance of the Zhongyuan land. The once devastated and crippled national economy has now developed into a complete system with a full range of industries, a reasonable structure, and an initial scale. The annual industrial output value has increased by 228.4 times compared to 1949, and the annual agricultural output value has increased by 5.1 times. In particular, grain production has increased from 14.27 billion jin in 1949 to nearly 60 billion jin, achieving self-sufficiency with surplus; science, technology, education, culture, health, and sports have made great strides from a very backward base. The living standards of the people are steadily improving. In just 40 years, the changes that have taken place on the 160,000 square kilometers of Henan land are unparalleled in any other period of history, demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and further strengthening the resolve and confidence of the people of Henan to follow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and walk the socialist path.

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee opened a new chapter in the history of the Republic, and also ushered in a new development period for the socialist construction of Henan. The people of the entire province have enthusiastically and actively thrown themselves into the reform tide from the countryside to the cities, turning one reform measure after another into a colorful life practice. In the past decade, the province's gross national product has increased by 1.77 times, and the long-standing problem of basic subsistence has been basically solved. The first step of the economic development strategy has been basically realized. It can be said that these ten years are the years when we have seriously implemented the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and are the best and fastest years of socialist construction in our province since the founding of the nation. Practice has proven that as long as we adhere to the four cardinal principles and correctly implement the general policy of reform and opening up of the Party Central Committee, the superiority of the socialist system will be more fully demonstrated, and our socialist cause will always maintain vigorous vitality. At any time, we must adhere to the four cardinal principles, resist and oppose bourgeois liberalization, and be vigilant against any attempt to change the socialist direction of China.

In the past 40 years of tremendous changes, the people of Henan have won one victory after another in socialist construction, but they have also taken detours and paid heavy prices. Some experiences and lessons are deeply ingrained.

	•	Liberating the mind, seeking truth from facts, speaking the truth, and doing practical work is an experience we must firmly grasp. At any time, we must adhere to combining the universal principles of Marxism, the policies of the Central Committee with the specific conditions of the local area, and proceed from reality. We must learn from the experiences of other places, but we must not simply copy them; we must not be content with being backward, but we must not be impatient for quick results; we must be full of enthusiasm, but we must also have a scientific attitude, and we must not engage in formalism and "window dressing."

	•	Henan has a weak foundation and a thin base, and building socialism requires hard work, generation after generation, and diligent effort. There is no room for half-truths and exaggeration. In times of difficulty, we must persevere and not lose heart; in times of good fortune, we must also persevere and not be overly optimistic. We must prevent our heads from getting hot. The predecessors must lay the foundation for the successors, and today we must prepare for tomorrow. We must strive unremittingly and tenaciously for the revitalization of Henan, one step at a time.

	•	Maintaining a stable and united political situation is an indispensable condition for socialist construction. The people of Henan have suffered greatly from turmoil and have deeply felt the harm of "in-fighting." They should cherish and protect this hard-won stable and united situation. Maintaining and strengthening the unity of the cadre team, the unity of the people, and social stability is the wish of the people of the entire province and is also the source of our strength in building socialism. We must unswervingly adhere to the "two-handed" approach, strengthen the construction of the Party, strengthen democratic legal construction, and ensure that the socialist construction of Henan develops more steadily, more quickly, and better.

Today, many aspects of Henan are still relatively backward, and there will be many difficulties on the road ahead, but we are full of confidence in achieving the magnificent goal of doubling the output by the end of the century and the rise of Zhongyuan. Forty years of socialist construction have laid a solid foundation for us, accumulating both positive and negative experiences; Henan is located in the central plains, with advantages in transportation, geography, and rich above-ground and underground resources, and has great potential for economic development; with the correct line, principles, and policies of the Party, the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the correct leadership of the new central leadership, and the glorious tradition of the 80 million people of Zhongyuan, we will surely display a new style in the socialist modernization construction, show more enthusiastic and enterprising spirit, and create even greater achievements. The future of socialism is bright, and the land of Zhongyuan is full of hope.

    四十年沧桑巨变的启示
    中共河南省委书记　杨析综
    新中国诞生40年了。伴随着祖国前进的步伐，河南人民走过了不平凡的历程。
    勤劳、朴实的中原人民，曾以自己的聪明、智慧创造过中华民族的灿烂文化，为人类的文明进步作出过巨大的贡献。然而，上下两千年，人民始终没有改变自己被压迫、被奴役、被剥削的地位和命运，直到解放前夕仍然挣扎在饥饿的死亡线上。新中国的诞生才使他们真正掌握了自己的命运。40年来，中原人民在党的领导下，走社会主义道路，用勤劳的双手创造美好的新生活，使中原大地的面貌发生了历史性的变化。原来疮痍满目、病骨支离的国民经济，到今天已经发展成为门类齐全、结构合理、初具规模的完整体系，工业年产值比1949年增长228.4倍，农业年产值增长5.1倍，特别是粮食生产由1949年的142.7亿斤发展到近600亿斤，实现了自给有余；科技、教育、文化、卫生和体育事业在十分落后的基础上得到了巨大发展。人民生活水平日益提高。短短的40年，16万平方公里的河南大地所发生的变化，是历朝历代任何一个时期都无法比拟的，它显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性，更加坚定了河南人民在中国共产党领导下，走社会主义道路的决心和信心。
    党的十一届三中全会揭开了共和国历史上新的一页，也使河南社会主义建设事业进入了一个新的发展时期。全省人民以极大的热情和积极性投身到从农村到城市的改革大潮中去，把一项项改革措施变成了丰富多彩的生活实践。10年间，全省国民生产总值增长了1.77倍，长期困扰我们的温饱问题得到了基本解决，经济发展战略的第一步任务已经基本实现。可以说，这十年是我们认真贯彻十一届三中全会路线、方针、政策的十年，是建国以来我省社会主义建设发展最快、最好的十年。实践证明，只要我们在坚持四项基本原则的前提下，正确贯彻党中央改革开放的总方针，社会主义制度的优越性就会更加充分地发挥出来，我们的社会主义事业就会永远保持蓬勃的生机和活力。任何时候我们都要坚持四项基本原则，抵制和反对资产阶级自由化，警惕一切妄图改变中国社会主义方向的企图。
    40年沧桑巨变，河南人民在社会主义建设中夺取了一个又一个胜利，但也走过弯路，付出过沉重的代价，有些经验教训是刻骨铭心的。
    ——解放思想、实事求是、讲真话、办实事是我们必须牢牢记取的一条经验。在任何时候都要坚持把马克思主义的普遍原理，把中央的方针政策同本地的具体情况紧密结合起来，一切从实际出发。既要学习外地经验，又不能照抄照搬；既要不甘落后，又不能急于求成；既要满腔热情，又要有科学态度，不能搞形式主义“花架子”。
    ——河南基础差、底子薄，建设社会主义尤其需要脚踏实地、一代接一代地艰苦奋斗，埋头苦干，来不得半点虚假和浮夸。困难时要艰苦奋斗，不能畏缩不前，丧失信心；形势好时也要艰苦奋斗，不能盲目乐观，谨防头脑发热。前人要为后人打基础，今天要为明天做准备，一步一个脚印地为河南振兴长期不懈地奋斗，坚韧不拔地开拓。
    ——保持安定团结的政治局面是社会主义建设必不可缺少的条件。河南人民曾饱尝动乱之苦，深受“窝里斗”之害，对今天来之不易的安定团结的局面应当更加珍惜和爱护。保持和加强干部队伍的团结、人民的团结、社会的安定是全省人民的愿望，也是我们建设社会主义的力量所在。我们要始终不渝地坚持“两手抓”，大力加强党的建设，加强民主法制建设，保证河南社会主义建设事业发展得更稳、更快、更好。
    今天，河南许多方面仍比较落后，前进的道路上还会遇到重重困难，但我们对到本世纪末实现翻两番的宏伟目标，对中原的崛起充满信心。40年的社会主义建设为我们奠定了坚实的基础，积累了正反两方面的经验；河南地处中原，具有交通、地理和丰富地上地下资源的优势，经济发展的潜力很大；有党的正确的路线方针政策，有党的十三届四中全会精神，有新的中央领导核心的正确领导，具有光荣传统的八千万中原儿女，必将在社会主义现代化建设中，展示出新的风采，焕发出更加饱满的热情和进取精神，创造出更伟大的业绩。社会主义前景光辉灿烂，中原大地充满希望。
