The first continuing education seminar for graduates of the Training Department of the Central Party School was held on August 15. Over 300 graduates who had graduated a few years ago returned to their alma mater from various parts of the country to engage in theoretical discussions on the theme of "Marxism and Contemporary Chinese Reality."

The newly appointed Deputy Director of the Central Party School, Xue Ju, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that currently, the important task for the Party's cadres is to re-study Marxist theory and research new situations and problems in the new era. Regarding the understanding of Marxism, there needs to be a process of cognition, practice, re-cognition, and re-practice. For cadre education, there also needs to be a process of work, education, re-work, and re-education.

Xue Ju believes that the criticism of bourgeois liberalization should focus on four aspects: political pluralism, economic privatization, ideological liberalization, and the unhealthy trends of "everything for oneself" and "everything for money." He hopes that in the process of criticism, a good academic style and a realistic attitude should be established. One should respect facts, submit to truth, and pay attention to methods.

    中央党校举办毕业学员研讨会
    主题是“马克思主义与当代中国现实”
    新华社北京电　（记者萧家保）中共中央党校培训部毕业学员首次继续教育研讨会15日举行开幕式。300多名已毕业几年的学员从祖国各地重返母校，就“马克思主义与当代中国现实”这一主题进行理论研讨。
    新上任的常务副校长薛驹在开幕式上说，当前，广大干部重新学习马克思主义理论、研究新形势下的新情况新问题是我党干部工作中的一个重要课题。对于马克思主义的认识，需要有一个认识、实践、再认识、再实践的过程，对于干部教育来讲，也需要有一个工作、教育、再工作、再教育的过程。
    薛驹认为，批判资产阶级自由化应集中在四个方面：政治上的多元化、经济上的私有化、思想上的自由化和道德上的一切为我、一切向钱看等不良思潮。他希望在批判中要树立良好的学风和实事求是的态度，要尊重事实，服从真理，讲究方法。
