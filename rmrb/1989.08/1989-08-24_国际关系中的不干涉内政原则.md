The principle of non-interference in internal affairs is an important fundamental principle in modern international relations and international law. Since China's suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, some Western countries have blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs, violating this widely recognized basic principle. To help readers better understand the historical development, legal concepts, and the relationship between the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and "international protection of human rights," this article is published.

**Historical Development and Its Significance**

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs emerged during the bourgeois revolutions of the 18th century. To counter the interference of European feudal monarchies in its revolution, France explicitly stipulated in its 1793 constitution: "The French Republic does not interfere in the politics of other countries, nor does it allow other countries to interfere in the politics of France" (Article 119 of the 1793 French Constitution). In the 19th century, the principle of non-interference further developed. In 1823, to block the interference of the Holy Alliance in the independence of Spanish colonies in South America, the United States declared that it would not interfere in European affairs and would not allow European countries to extend their political systems to the Americas and interfere with the independence of Spanish colonies, known as the "Monroe Doctrine." By the latter half of the 19th century, the principle of non-interference gradually replaced the interventionism of the Holy Alliance and became an accepted principle of international law. After the October Revolution, to counter the armed intervention of imperialist countries, the Soviet state firmly advocated the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and, through treaties, solidified it in international relations, giving this principle new democratic content to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of emerging nations.

After World War II, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs was affirmed in the United Nations Charter and subsequent important international legal documents. Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter states, "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The 1965 Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December, and the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, both explicitly prohibit any state from directly or indirectly interfering in the internal and external affairs of another state. However, in practice, imperialist interference in the internal affairs of other countries has frequently been a source of international tension. Examples include the U.S. blockade of the Taiwan Strait and the Suez Canal incident.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs has been a fundamental principle that China has consistently adhered to in its foreign relations. One of the five principles of peaceful coexistence that China actively advocates and promotes is mutual non-interference in internal affairs.

From the historical development of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, it can be seen that opposing interference in the internal affairs of other countries essentially reflects the struggle of emerging, newly independent, and small countries to safeguard their sovereignty and independence. Therefore, this principle is highly valued by many Third World countries, which regard it as a principle of their foreign policy or multilateral relations. For example, the charters of the Organization of American States, the Arab League, and the Organization of African Unity, as well as the Bandung Conference and various conferences of non-aligned countries, all adhere to this principle.

**Legal Concepts and Controversies**

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs is a direct consequence of state sovereignty, but its development into a separate legal principle in international law reflects the actual inequality among states in international relations and is a product of the fundamental conflict of interests among states. Therefore, with the development and changes in international relations, its content is also evolving.

According to the 1965 Declaration on Non-Interference in Internal Affairs, the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law, and general principles of international law, the principle of non-interference includes: (1) No state has the right to directly or indirectly interfere in the internal or external affairs of any other state for any reason; (2) No state may use or encourage the use of economic, political, or any other means to coerce another state to submit or gain benefits; (3) No state may organize, assist, create, fund, incite, or condone subversive, terrorist, or armed activities aimed at overthrowing the government of another state by force, or incite or condone the internal chaos of another state; (4) No state may in any way deprive or obstruct another state from choosing and implementing its own political, economic, social, and cultural systems. The above points constitute the basic content of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Any state engaging in the above behaviors constitutes a violation of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs requires strict respect for the exclusive authority of each state to decide and manage its internal affairs. Generally, matters under domestic jurisdiction, such as determining political and economic systems, legislation, social and cultural development, etc., are internal affairs. According to the United Nations Charter and general international law, there are certain exceptions to the application of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. For example, for actions that violate international peace and security and international legal norms and constitute international crimes, such as aggression, genocide, and apartheid, the international community has the right to take actions or measures to stop them. Such actions and measures cannot be considered interference in internal affairs. Additionally, the exercise of rights by contracting parties according to treaty provisions or the adoption of reciprocal or retaliatory measures for breaches of treaty do not constitute interference in internal affairs.

However, in international practice, the issue of "exceptions to the principle of non-interference" is often controversial. Imperialist countries, in order to maintain their spheres of influence and strategic interests, interfere in the internal affairs of small countries, creating various legal justifications as exceptions to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs to cover up the illegality of their actions. They either distort international law principles such as self-defense and collective security, or use so-called "resource security," "protection of nationals," and "human rights protection" as pretexts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

The establishment of the legal concept of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and the controversies surrounding it essentially reflect the conflict and coordination of the fundamental interests of various countries; the struggle over the interpretation and application of the principle of non-interference often has a sharp political nature.

**Relationship with International Protection of Human Rights**

In the current struggle over the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, some Western powers have prominently used human rights to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. They use human rights as a means to interfere in the politics of other countries and attempt to change their social systems. They create various legal arguments and design various international mechanisms and procedures to "monitor" and "protect" the human rights of other countries. Among these, a point that has significant international influence but is legally difficult to define is: "Human rights are no longer a matter of internal jurisdiction, and international protection of human rights does not apply the principle of non-interference in internal affairs." In reality, this proposition lacks legal basis and is ambiguous (the so-called "human rights," whether as a "value standard" or a "rights system," have different interpretations in various countries, and the premise of the proposition is an uncertain legal concept), and in practice, it is very harmful. If the principle of non-interference is opened up here, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Legally, first, the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, as a fundamental principle of international relations and international law, applies to all areas of international relations and international law (except for certain limited exceptions stipulated by international law); and international law or international human rights law does not have a general rule that "international protection of human rights" constitutes an exception to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.

Second, the international protection of human rights must be specifically implemented through the domestic legislation, judiciary, and administrative practices of various countries; the rights and freedoms of individuals are mainly guaranteed and implemented by the constitutions and relevant laws of various countries. No country has the right to interfere in the legislative, judicial, and other rights of another country.

Finally, although there are a series of international human rights documents on the international protection of human rights, the specific content and definitions of the relevant rights, freedoms, and restrictions are not stipulated, and the ideologies, societies, politics, economies, and legal systems of various countries are different, so the content, definitions, and restrictions of rights often differ, and various countries have a great deal of discretion in practice. Each country implements the protection of human rights based on its own understanding of the above rights and freedoms and its national conditions. Any country, under the pretext of international protection, imposes its own value standards and legal concepts as international common standards and forces other countries to accept them, which is clearly an act of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

Many countries do not recognize the vague proposition of "international protection of human rights excludes the principle of non-interference in internal affairs" because there is no such provision in international law. "International protection of human rights" is only applicable under certain conditions, i.e., in some situations, such as foreign aggression and occupation, expansion of old and new colonialism, implementation of racial discrimination or apartheid, violation of the right to self-determination, the right to development, etc., large-scale violations and trampling of human rights, which are not internal affairs of a country, the international community has the right to condemn and take measures to stop them. Of course, the application of the principle of non-interference in the field of human rights is quite complex.

Strictly adhering to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs in international relations is of great significance for maintaining international peace and stability and is a basic requirement for the new international political order that China advocates. We should strive to seriously implement this important principle in international relations.

    国际关系中的不干涉内政原则
    一丁
    编者按：不干涉内政原则是现代国际关系和国际法上一项重要的基本原则。自从我国制止动乱，平息反革命暴乱以来，西方少数国家粗暴干涉我国内政，破坏了这一举世公认的基本原则。为帮助读者进一步了解不干涉内政原则的历史发展、法律概念及其与“人权的国际保护”的关系，特发表此文。
    历史发展及其重要意义
    不干涉内政原则产生于18世纪资产阶级革命时期。法国为反对欧洲封建专制王朝对其革命进行干涉，1793年在其宪法中明确规定：“法兰西共和国不干涉他国的政治，也不许他国干涉法国的政治。”（1793年《法兰西宪法》第119条）。19世纪，不干涉内政原则有了进一步的发展。1823年为阻挡欧洲神圣同盟对南美西属殖民地独立的干涉活动，美国声明，它不干涉欧洲的事情，也决不容许欧洲国家把它们的政治制度扩张到美洲而干涉西班牙殖民地的独立，即所谓的“门罗主义”。至19世纪下半叶，不干涉原则逐渐取代神圣同盟的干涉主义，而成为公认的国际法原则。十月革命后，为反对帝国主义国家的武装干涉，苏维埃国家坚决主张不干涉内政原则，并在国际交往中以条约的形式把它固定下来，使这项原则为维护新兴国家的独立与主权获得了新的民主内容。
    第二次世界大战后，不干涉内政原则在《联合国宪章》以及其后的一系列重要的国际法律文件中都得到了确认。《联合国宪章》第2条第七款规定，“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件。”1965年12月联合国大会通过的《关于各国内政不容干涉及其独立与主权之保护宣言》和1970年《关于各国依联合国宪章建立友好关系及合作之国际法原则宣言》，都明确禁止任何国家对他国的内政、外交进行直接或间接的干涉。可是实际上，帝国主义干涉他国内政屡屡成为国际关系紧张的根源。美国武装封锁我台湾海峡、苏伊士运河事件等都是干涉内政的突出的事例。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，不干涉内政原则是我国在对外关系中始终坚持的一项基本原则。我国积极倡导和主张的和平共处五项原则之一就是互不干涉内政。
    从不干涉内政原则的历史发展可以看出，反对干涉别国内政实质上反映了新兴国家、新独立国家和弱小国家维护主权与独立的斗争。因此，这一原则受到广大第三世界国家的高度重视，很多国家将其作为本国的外交政策或多边关系的原则。例如美洲国家组织、阿拉伯国家联盟和非洲统一组织的宪章，以及万隆会议、各次不结盟国家会议等，都坚持这一原则。
    法律概念及其争论
    不干涉内政作为国家主权原则的直接后果是不言而喻的，但其发展成为国际法中一个单独的法律原则则反映了国际关系中国家间实际上的不平等，是国家根本利益冲突的产物。因此，随着国际关系的发展和变化，其内容也在发展和变化。
    根据联合国1965年《不干涉内政宣言》和1970年《国际法原则宣言》以及一般国际法原则，不干涉原则是指：一、任何国家均无权以任何理由直接或间接干涉任何其他国家的内政、外交；二、不得使用或鼓励使用经济、政治或任何其他手段胁迫他国，以使该国屈服，或取得利益；三、不得组织、协助、制造、资助、煽动或纵容意在以暴力手段推翻另一国家政权的颠覆、恐怖或武装活动，或煽动或纵容煽动其他国家的内乱；四、不得以任何方式剥夺和阻挠其他国家自行选择和实行其政治、经济、社会及文化制度。上述各点构成不干涉内政原则的基本内容。一国从事上述行为即构成对不干涉内政原则的违反。
    不干涉内政原则要求严格尊重各国决定和管理其内政的专属权力。一般来说，凡属国内管辖的事务，如确定政治和经济制度、立法、社会和文化发展等，都是内政问题。根据联合国宪章和一般国际法，对不干涉内政原则的适用，有某些例外。如对于破坏国际和平与安全，破坏国际法准则而构成国际罪行的行为，如侵略、种族灭绝、种族隔离等等，国际社会有必要采取行动或措施加以制止。这类行动和措施不能被视为是对内政的干涉。此外，缔约国之间根据条约规定行使权利或对违约行为采取对等或报复措施也不属干涉内政。
    但是，在国际实践中，关于“不干涉原则的例外”问题往往是有争议的。帝国主义国家为维护自己的势力范围和战略利益、干涉弱小国家的内部事务，制造了种种法律理由，作为不干涉内政原则的例外，以掩饰其行为的非法性。它们或者歪曲国际法上的自卫、集体安全等原则，或者硬以所谓“资源安全”、“保护侨民”、“人权保护”等为借口干涉别国内部事务。
    不干涉内政原则的法律概念的确立及其争论，实质上反映了各国根本利益的冲突和协调；围绕不干涉原则的解释和适用的斗争，通常都带有尖锐的政治性质。
    同人权的国际保护的关系
    围绕现今不干涉内政原则的斗争，有些西方大国利用人权干涉别国内政的问题十分突出。它们以人权为手段，干涉别国政治，试图改变别国的社会制度。它们制造种种法律论据，设计种种国际机制和程序，去“关注”和“保护”别国的人权。其中，在国际上颇有影响、而法律上界线又不易划分的一个论点是：“人权已不属于各国内部管辖的事务，对人权的国际保护不适用不干涉内政原则。”实际上，这个命题在法律上缺乏根据，且含混不清（这里所谓的“人权”，无论是作为“价值标准”，或是“权利体系”，各国都有不同解释，命题的前提就是一个不确定的法律概念），在实践上则十分有害，不干涉原则如果在这里敞开口子，后果不堪设想。
    从法律上看，首先，不干涉内政原则作为一项国际关系和国际法的基本原则，适用于国际关系和国际法的一切领域（除了国际法规定的某些有限的例外）；而国际法或国际人权法都没有一条规则，一般规定“人权的国际保护”构成不干涉内政原则的例外。
    其次，人权的国际保护，要具体通过各国的国内立法、司法和行政实践来实现；个人的权利和自由主要是由各国的宪法和有关法律规定和保障实施的。任何国家无权对别国的立法、司法等权利进行干预。
    最后，在国际上尽管存在一系列有关人权国际保护的国际人权文书，但对有关权利、自由以及限制均未规定具体的内容和定义，各国意识形态、社会、政治、经济、法律制度不同，权利的内容、定义和限制也往往互有差异，各国在实际上有很大的自由裁量权，各国都是根据自己对上述权利、自由的理解以及本国的国情来实现对人权的保护的。任何国家以国际保护为由，以自己的价值标准和法律概念充当国际共同标准，强要别国接受，显然是干涉别国内部事务的行为。
      许多国家不承认“人权的国际保护排除不干涉内政原则”的笼统命题，因为国际法上并不存在这样一条规定。“人权的国际保护”只是在一定条件下适用。即：在某种情况下，例如，外国侵略和占领、新老殖民主义扩张、实行种族歧视或种族隔离、违反民族自决权、发展权等大规模侵犯和践踏人权，即不属于一国内政，国际社会有权谴责和采取措施予以制止。当然，不干涉原则在人权领域的适用是相当复杂的。
    在国际关系中严格遵守不干涉内政原则，对于维护国际和平与稳定有重要意义，也是我国倡导的国际政治新秩序的基本要求。我们应当为在国际关系中认真实行这一重要原则而努力。
