In the fields of Wuqing County, Tianjin, people often see a new type of science and technology education team—the rural science and technology lecturer team. They disseminate a large amount of practical rural technology to thousands of households, bringing about significant economic and social benefits, and are known by local farmers as the "wealth-bringing team."

Wuqing County established the rural science and technology lecturer team in early 1987, consisting of 228 agricultural technical personnel, rural planting and breeding experts, and teachers from township adult schools. They voluntarily teach scientific and technological knowledge to farmers, injecting new vitality into the rural economy.

The rural science and technology lecturer team adopts a method of roving lectures, primarily through face-to-face instruction, supplemented by radio lectures, and combines classroom centralized teaching with field dispersed guidance. According to the seasons, they solve problems in agricultural production. This straightforward and practical teaching method is very popular among farmers. Farmers say, "Such lectures are refreshing and enlightening."

Many farmers who participate in the learning have become specialized households for scientific and technological wealth, and some have even become part-time teachers and technical consultants for local farmers.

    武清农科讲师团受欢迎
    本报天津8月15日电　记者梁小琴报道：在天津武清县的田间地头，人们常常看到一支新型的科技教育队伍——农村科技讲师团。他们把大量的农村实用技术传授到千家万户，带来了显著的经济效益和社会效益，被当地农民称为“送财团”。
    武清县于1987年初建立了由农业技术人员、农村种、养殖能手和乡镇成人学校教师等228人组成的农村科技讲师团，他们免费向农民传授科技知识，为农村经济注入了新的活力。
    农村科技讲师团按照巡回讲课的方式，以面授为主，广播讲座辅之，还把课堂集中讲授与田间分散辅导结合起来，根据时令季节，解答农业生产中的难题。这种通俗易懂、实际可行的讲授很受农民欢迎。农民们说：“这样的讲座听了解渴，看了开窍。”
    参加学习的农民，不少人成了科技致富专业户，有的还成了当地农民的业余教员和技术顾问。
