The Macau Basic Law Structure Special Consultative Group announced on August 11 that the consultation period for the Basic Law structure will be extended from the end of August to the end of September. The group also decided to establish a publicity team to strengthen the promotion of the Basic Law through various means.

At the full meeting of the consultative group held on August 11, someone proposed that the first phase of the Basic Law structure consultation does not need to be rushed to completion before the mainland drafting committee arrives in Macau. Instead, it should start from the actual situation in Macau and widely solicit the opinions of the citizens. This proposal was supported by the majority of the members, and it was decided to extend the consultation period by one month. The meeting also adopted the "Rules of Procedure for the Macau Basic Law Structure Special Consultative Group" and the work plan for the near future.

    据新华社澳门八月十二日电　澳门基本法结构专责咨询小组十一日宣布，将基本法结构的咨询期从原定的八月底延长到九月底，同时决定设立一个宣传小组，通过各种方式加强基本法的宣传活动。
    在十一日举行的专责小组全体会议上，有人提出，基本法结构第一阶段的咨询工作，无须急于在内地草委来澳之前完成，而应从澳门实际出发，广泛征询市民意见，这个提议得到大多数成员的赞同，并决定将咨询期推延一个月。会议还通过了《澳门基本法结构专责咨询小组守则》和近期的工作计划。
