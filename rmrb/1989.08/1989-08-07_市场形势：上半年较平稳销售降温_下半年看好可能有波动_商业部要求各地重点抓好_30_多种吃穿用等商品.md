	Beijing, August 7 (Reporter Pan Gang) - Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Commerce Zhang Shiyao today briefed the capital's news media on the current market situation. He said that, due to the full implementation of the policies proposed by the Thirteenth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to rectify and deepen reforms, various regions have taken effective measures to stabilize prices and the market. The national urban and rural markets have been relatively stable in the first half of this year. Especially in the few months after the Spring Festival, the situation of over-sales and market instability last year has been initially reversed.

	Zhang Shiyao believes that the main feature of the market in the first half of the year is that sales have cooled down. The total retail sales of social commodities nationwide in the first half of the year were 411.95 billion yuan, an increase of 18.3% over the same period last year. After deducting the price increase factor, the actual decrease was 5.8%. The living arrangements and market supply in rural areas are relatively good, and the food shortage problem in disaster-stricken areas has been basically properly arranged. In terms of the supply of agricultural production materials, due to strengthened market management, the supply of fertilizers and agricultural films has significantly improved this year, except for a shortage in the supply of some pesticides. The Ministry of Commerce has issued specific supply targets for rural areas for four commodities: sugar, iron wire, nails, and color TVs, increasing the supply to rural areas. The quantity of general daily-use industrial products going to the countryside has generally increased.

	Regarding the market situation in the second half of the year, Zhang Shiyao pointed out that the overall market situation should be optimistic. As long as the work is done well, there should not be major fluctuations. However, it must also be noted that the current economic situation remains severe. Long-standing prominent problems, coupled with the losses caused by the turmoil and riots, have already and will continue to be exposed. Therefore, in terms of the market, there are still some unstable factors and risks of fluctuations beneath the surface calm.

	Zhang Shiyao said that the gap between total demand and total supply in the second half of the year will still be relatively large, and the structural contradictions of commodities will still be prominent. According to estimates, the market supply-demand gap this year is about 8 billion yuan. In terms of commodity inventory, the total inventory of commodities at the end of June, after deducting the price increase factor, is basically the same as the same period last year. However, the inventory at the same period last year was after several rounds of panic buying in the first half of the year. In terms of commodity structure, on the one hand, many marketable commodities are in short supply, especially some key commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihood such as grain, cotton, oil, some cotton textiles, high-quality fertilizers, and some pesticides, whose inventories have decreased significantly and the gap is large. On the other hand, some commodities have shown market supply weakness, including many daily-use industrial products and household appliances, as well as woolen textiles, which are not selling well and have increased inventory. In addition, the overall supply of funds is still tight.

	Zhang Shiyao urged various regions to adopt a "two-pronged approach" in commodity supply: one hand must continue to ensure the supply of several essential commodities for people's livelihood to maintain market stability, and the other hand must vigorously promote the sales of other commodities to promote procurement, production, operation, and benefits through sales.

	Zhang Shiyao said that the second half of the year will focus on more than 30 types of commodities, including food items such as grain, oil, vegetables, pork, beef, mutton, eggs, sugar, salt, and border tea; clothing items such as cotton, hemp, pure cotton fabric, blended fabric, pure synthetic fabric, undershirts, cotton sweaters, thermal underwear, towels, and socks; daily-use items such as matches, detergents, school supplies, toilet paper, light bulbs, stoves, chimneys, iron pots, aluminum products, and enamelware; and production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural films, iron wire, and nails.

	Zhang Shiyao also said that in the second half of the year, the focus should be on expanding the sales of a large number of general commodities and slow-moving commodities, especially on expanding the sales of industrial products to the countryside and improving the supply of rural markets during the peak season.

    市场形势：上半年较平稳销售降温 下半年看好可能有波动
    商业部要求各地重点抓好30多种吃穿用等商品
    本报北京8月7日讯　记者潘岗报道：商业部副部长张世尧今天向首都新闻界介绍当前市场形势时说，由于全党全国认真贯彻落实党的十三届三中全会提出的治理整顿和深化改革的方针，各地在稳定物价、稳定市场方面普遍采取了有力的调控措施，今年上半年全国城乡市场比较平稳。特别是春节后几个月，已初步扭转了去年销售过旺、市场不稳的局面。
    张世尧认为上半年市场的主要特点是，市场销售有所降温。上半年全国社会商品零售总额为4119.5亿元，比去年同期增长18.3％，扣除涨价因素，实际下降5.8％。农村生活安排和市场供应较好，灾区缺粮问题基本上得到了妥善安排。在农业生产资料供应方面，由于加强了市场管理，今年以来除部分农药供应较紧外，化肥、农膜的供应明显好转。因商业部今年对食糖、铁丝、元钉、彩电四种商品专门下达了供应农村的指标，增加了对农村的供应量。一般日用工业品下乡数量多数都有增加。
    谈到下半年市场形势，张世尧指出，下半年市场形势总的应该是看好的。只要把工作做好了，不至于出现大的波动。但也要看到，当前的经济形势依然严峻，多年积累下来的一些突出问题，再加上动乱、暴乱造成的损失已经和将要继续暴露出来，因此，就市场来说，在表面平稳之下，仍然潜伏着一些不稳定的因素和出现波动的危险。
    张世尧说，下半年市场总需求与总供给之间的差额仍然较大，商品结构性的矛盾仍然很突出。据匡算，今年市场供需差额约在800亿元左右。就商品库存来看，6月底商品库存总额，扣除涨价因素后和去年同期基本持平，而去年同期的库存是经过上半年几次抢购后的低谷时期。在商品结构上，一方面很多适销商品供应不足，特别是一些关系国计民生的主要商品如粮、棉、油、部分棉纺织品、优质化肥和部分农药等，库存下降较多，缺口较大。另一方面，一部分商品又出现市场供应疲软，包括很多日用工业品和家用电器，以及毛纺织品等，销售不畅，库存增加。另外，资金供应总的仍然紧张。
    张世尧要求各地在商品供应方面采取
  “两手抓”，即一手要继续抓好若干种人民生活必需品的供应，保证市场大局的稳定，另一手要对其他商品大力推销，以销售促收购、促生产，以销售促经营、促效益。
    张世尧说，下半年重点抓好的30多种商品是，吃的商品有粮、油、菜、猪、牛、羊、蛋、糖、盐、边销茶；穿的商品有棉、麻、纯棉布、混纺布、纯化纤布、汗衫背心、棉毛衫裤、卫生衫裤、毛巾、袜子；用的商品有火柴、洗涤用品、学生用品、卫生纸、灯泡、炉子、烟筒、铁锅、铝制品、搪瓷制品；生产资料有化肥、农药、农膜、铁丝、元钉。
    张世尧还说，下半年要把扩大销售的重点放到大量的一般商品、平销滞销商品上，特别要放到扩大工业品下乡、搞好农村旺季市场供应上。
