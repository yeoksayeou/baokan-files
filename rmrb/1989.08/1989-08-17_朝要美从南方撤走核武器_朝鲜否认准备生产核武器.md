	North Korea Demands U.S. Withdraw Nuclear Weapons from the South
	North Korea Denies Preparations for Nuclear Weapons Production

	People's Daily, Pyongyang, August 17 (Reported by Xu Baokang) — Today, the vice-chairman of the North Korean Anti-Nuclear Peace Committee, Li Chenghai, held a press conference. He strongly demanded that the United States take concrete actions to withdraw nuclear weapons from South Korea to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula. He also issued an appeal, hoping that countries around the world would support and sympathize with the North Korean people's struggle to turn the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone.

	The appeal stated that the United States has deployed 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea, seriously escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea believes that while the United States is discussing the reduction of nuclear and conventional weapons with relevant countries, it should not exclude the issue of withdrawing nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea.

	The appeal emphasized that if the United States truly cares about peace in Korea, it should take action to withdraw nuclear troops from South Korea.

	When asked by a reporter about recent foreign media reports suggesting that North Korea might be developing the capability to produce nuclear weapons, Li Chenghai explained that North Korea is a peace-loving country and does not want a nuclear war.

	North Korea's policy is anti-war and anti-nuclear, so North Korea will not produce nuclear weapons and does not have the capability to produce nuclear weapons. The United States' propaganda that North Korea is producing nuclear weapons is to justify their deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea.

    朝要美从南方撤走核武器
    朝鲜否认准备生产核武器
    本报平壤8月17日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜反核和平委员会副委员长李成镐今天举行记者招待会，强烈要求美国采取实际措施，从南朝鲜撤走核武器，以保障朝鲜半岛的和平，并发表呼吁书，希望世界各国支持和声援朝鲜人民为把朝鲜半岛变成无核和平区的斗争。
    呼吁书指出，美国已在南朝鲜部署了1000枚核武器，严重地激化了朝鲜半岛的局势。朝鲜认为，美国在同有关国家商讨裁减核武器和常规武器的时候，不能排除商讨从南朝鲜撤走核武器和军队的问题。
    呼吁书强调说，如果美国真正关心朝鲜的和平，就应当采取行动，从南朝鲜撤走核军队。
    当有记者问到不久前外电报道朝鲜可能在发展制造核武器的能力一事时，李成镐解释说，朝鲜是爱好和平的国家，它不希望发生核战争。
    朝鲜的政策是反战反核，所以朝鲜不会生产核武器，也不具备生产核武器的能力。美国宣传朝鲜要生产核武器，是为了使他们在南朝鲜部署核武器合法化。
