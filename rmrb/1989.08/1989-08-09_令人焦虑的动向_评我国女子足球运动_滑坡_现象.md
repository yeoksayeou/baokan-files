An Alarming Trend—Evaluating the "Slump" in Women's Football in China

Recently, while watching the national women's football championship semi-finals, there were rumors that some women's football teams in China would be demoted to lower levels or disbanded. This has caused concern and anxiety among relevant parties.

Earlier this year, the sports events for the seventh National Games were confirmed. Subsequently, various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions adjusted their respective training programs to prepare for the competition. It is reported that only two provinces intend to participate in the women's football event in the National Games. However, according to the regulations, events with fewer than six teams registered will not be held. Meanwhile, women's football is beginning to be "neglected" in some provinces and cities. Even teams that have maintained the national championship and runner-up titles for many years, or teams that have qualified for the semi-finals of this year's national women's football championship, are now being demoted to lower levels. Some teams have even "retired" altogether. Last year, there were 29 teams competing in the national women's football championship, but this year the number has dropped to only 19. Some players have expressed that after this year's competition, they will be collectively demoted or disbanded. Consequently, some female football players in youth sports schools in various provinces and cities, who have no receiving units, will also "disband" in advance.

Although China's women's football started late, it has made rapid progress. Women's football was nurtured at the grassroots level in the early 1980s and was officially listed as a national competition event in 1986. Currently, most players have relatively standardized techniques, and tactics are basically formed, with some outstanding talents emerging. By last year, 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions had 29 first-team squads and 21 second-team squads. Many provincial and municipal youth sports schools also have female football players. Women's football in China has already shown a promising scale.

Currently, China's women's football team is the best in Asia and is also a strong contender in the world women's football arena. In 1986, the Chinese women's football team made its debut and won the championship at the sixth Asian Cup; last year, during a visit to Europe, they defeated the Yugoslav team, which has been developing women's football for nearly 20 years, with an overwhelming advantage, stunning the world.

It should be said that women's football is one of China's strong projects. Now, countries like the Soviet Union are investing heavily in women's football, and Yugoslavia is also determined to catch up. However, China's women's football is "cooling down" on its own, which is really worrying. Asia has women's football cup competitions, and the women's football event will also be held at the Asian Games in Beijing next year. The first World Women's Football Championship will also be held in Guangzhou in 1991. If China's women's football continues to decline, how will we, as the host country, face the challenges then? It is hoped that the decision-makers of China's football will plan for the long term, protect China's young and promising women's football, and not let it go to waste.

    令人焦虑的动向
    ——评我国女子足球运动“滑坡”现象
    近日，在观赏全国女子足球锦标赛复赛的同时，风传着我国一些地方的女足队伍将下放给基层或解散的信息。这引起有关人士的焦虑和关注。
    今年年初，确定了第七届全国运动会的比赛项目。之后，各省、市、自治区据此调整了各自的运动训练项目，以便届时参赛。据悉，只有两个省有意报名参加全运会女足角逐，但根据规定，报名不足6个队的项目将不进行比赛。同时，女足运动在一些省市区开始受到“冷落”。保持多年全国冠、亚军称号的省队，甚至已获得今年全国女足锦标赛复赛权的省队现已被下放给基层。更有些省队干脆“解甲归田”。全国女足锦标赛去年还有29个队角逐，而今年一下子便跌到只有19个队参赛。其中一些队员反映，今年的赛事完结后，她们将集体地被下放或解散。随之而来的是一些省市青少年体校的女足项目的学员，因无接纳单位也将提前“散伙”。
    我国女足运动起步虽晚，但进步很快。女足运动自八十年代初孕育于基层，1986年被正式列为全国竞赛项目。目前大多数选手技术较为规范，战术基本成型，并涌现出一些水平突出的尖子。到去年为止，25个省、市、自治区共有29支一线队伍和21支二线队伍。许多省市青少年体校还拥有女足学员。女足运动在我国已初具喜人规模。
    如今，我国女子足球队在亚洲首屈一指，在世界女子足坛上也属劲旅之列。1986年，中国女子足球队首次出征，便夺得第六届亚洲杯赛冠军；去年出访欧洲，就以绝对优势击败开展女足运动近20年的南斯拉夫队，令人瞠目。
    应该说女足运动是我国的一个优势项目。现在，苏联等国不惜代价开展女足运动，南斯拉夫也立志奋起直追，而我国的女足运动却在自行“降温”，实在令人不安。亚洲设有女子足球杯赛，并且明年在北京举行的亚运会上也设有女足项目，首届世界女子足球锦标赛也将于1991年在广州举行。如果我国女足运动继续滑坡，届时，作为东道国，我们将如何迎战呢？希望我国足球运动决策者能从长计议，保护我国年幼而有前途的奋发而有实力的女足运动，不要使其前功尽弃。
