New woodcut art in China is a very young art form. Fifty-three years ago, when this seed of revolutionary art sprouted and grew two tender leaves in our troubled land, the woodcut master Lu Xun pointed out: “The woodcut art that has suddenly risen in the past five years…is the consistent demand of the author and the masses, so with just a few young people’s iron pens and several wooden blocks, it can develop so vigorously. It expresses the enthusiasm of art apprentices, and therefore it often reflects the soul of modern society.” (From the preface to the “National Woodcut Exhibition Album,” 1935)

Zhao Yanni has been engaged in woodcut creation for 49 years. He has persistently followed the path of combining new woodcut art with the people, and his works all originate from life and belong to the people. Generally, his works can be divided into three parts: single woodcut, portrait woodcut, and illustration woodcut.

Before the 1970s, Zhao Yanni’s creations were mainly single woodcuts. After that, they were mostly illustrations for Lu Xun’s novels, and in between, he created many portrait woodcuts. Based on the author’s artistic thoughts, the content of his single woodcuts deeply reflects the reality of life in various historical periods. The themes before liberation expose the dark side of the old society, sympathize with the people’s suffering, echo the people’s calls, and encourage the people’s struggle. The characteristics are realistic, focusing on character portrayal, adopting meticulous knife techniques and black-and-white contrast that are unique to woodcuts, forming a personal artistic style. Examples include “Carrying Wood,” “Abandoned Baby,” “Rushing for Rice,” and “Remembering…” After liberation, he enthusiastically sings the praises of the new people and new things in the new society, focusing on socialist construction. With rigorous composition and richly varied techniques, he meticulously depicts workers’ day and night efforts to build reservoirs and roads, adding one brick and one stone to the socialist edifice, such as in “Racing Against Time,” “Moving Mountains,” and “The Journey.” He is also interested in depicting revolutionary history, such as in “Protest,” “Gold Sand Uprising,” and “The Sinful Charity House.” At this time, Zhao Yanni recognized the historical value of great figures, so his creations shifted to portrait woodcuts. Examples include the revolutionary literary flag bearer with the “fierce brow and bowed head” spirit, “Lu Xun,” the great internationalist spirit of “Dr. Norman Bethune” who dedicated himself to the Chinese revolution, black revolutionaries who fought unyieldingly for freedom and liberation, such as in “Standing to Die” and “For Liberation,” and the old revolutionary who devoted his life to the cause, “Lin Boqu,” and so on.

After the 1960s, Zhao Yanni’s woodcut creations saw new developments. Starting from the creation of “Divorce” in 1963, he devoted his full energy to creating exquisite illustrations for eight of Lu Xun’s novels. These include illustrations for “The New Year Sacrifice,” “Kong Yiji,” “Medicine,” “Wild Grass,” “Sorrow of the Lonely,” “The True Story of Ah Q,” and “Diary of a Madman.” He can truly be called an expert in woodcut illustrations. The artistic characteristics of his illustrations are translating literary language into pictorial language, striving to make the illustrations and literature achieve a consistent style. His illustrations are both part of the literary works and have their independence, reaching a very high artistic level.

Zhao Yanni’s woodcuts are mainly in black and white. Black-and-white woodcuts do not dazzle with flashy appearances; they are simple and powerful, best showing the artist’s skill. They are a special artistic language of woodcut prints and have the characteristic of “the beauty of strength” that Lu Xun mentioned. Zhao Yanni’s black-and-white woodcuts are unique. He pays great attention to and successfully handles the black-and-white contrast on the canvas, thus producing a rich and harmonious rhythm. Appreciating his woodcuts is like listening to a Mozart symphony, feeling very pleasant. He created a technique of using a flat knife to lightly scrape or shave the surface of the wooden block and printing it on thin paper from the front, producing a special effect similar to Chinese ink painting on paper. We call this “hazy woodcut.” He uses this “hazy woodcut” not only to make the canvas tones gentle but also to depict the volume and texture of objects, showing a unique artistic expressive power. Lu Xun taught us that woodcutting should be done with a “direct knife,” and Zhao Yanni’s black-and-white woodcuts embody this spirit of direct knife work. Therefore, he attaches great importance to the unique “knife taste” and “wood taste” of woodcuts, as well as printing techniques.

An artist’s achievements cannot be examined separately from their thoughts and techniques. Lu Xun once said: “An artist must have proficient skills, but more importantly, they must have progressive thoughts and a noble character…. What we demand from artworks is a specimen representing the highest point of the Chinese nation’s intelligence, not the average score below the waterline of thought.” (From “Hot Wind – Random Thoughts 43”) Zhao Yanni’s woodcuts embody this sentiment. An artist like this, who has been tempered and grown in the great revolutionary era of contemporary China, is indeed a rare talent in our country’s art world. His artistic achievements are also a significant gain for our country’s printmaking industry.

    表现当代社会的灵魂
    ——赵延年与木刻艺术
    李桦
    新兴木刻在中国是一门很年轻的艺术。53年前，当这颗革命美术的种子在多难的国土中萌芽，长出两片幼嫩的子叶的时候，木刻导师鲁迅先生就指出：“近五年来骤然兴起的木刻……是作者和社会大众的内心一致的要求，所以仅有若干青年们的一副铁笔和几块木板，便能发展得如此蓬蓬勃勃。它所表现的是艺术学徒的热诚，因此也常常是现代社会的魂魄。”（《全国木刻联合展览会专辑》序，1935年）
    赵延年从事木刻创作已有49年。他热诚地坚持新兴木刻与人民心连心、相结合的道路，他的创作莫不源于生活而属于人民的。统观他的作品，大致可以分为单幅木刻、肖像木刻和插图木刻三个部分。
    在70年代前，赵延年的创作主要是单幅木刻，此后则多是鲁迅小说的插图，而夹在这两者中间则刻了许多肖像木刻。基于作者的艺术思想，其单幅木刻的内容都深入地反映各个历史时期的现实生活，其主题在解放前则暴露旧社会的黑暗面，同情人民的痛苦，喊出人民的呼声，鼓励人民的奋斗。其特点是写实的，着重于人物刻画，采取富有木刻特点的缜密刀法和黑白对比，形成个人的艺术风格。如《负木者》、《弃婴》、《抢米》、《想起了……》等。在解放后则热情地歌颂新社会的新人新事，首先是社会主义建设，用严谨的构图和变化丰富的技巧，细致地描绘工人们夜以继日修水库，建公路，为社会主义大厦添一木一石的愚公精神，如《和时间赛跑》、《移山》、《征途》等。他也有兴趣去表现革命的历史，如《抗议》、《金砂暴动》、《罪恶的仁爱堂》等。这时赵延年认识到伟大人物的历史价值，于是他的创作转移到肖像木刻方面来。如有“横眉”和“俯首”的硬骨头意志的革命文艺旗手《鲁迅》，有为中国革命献身的伟大国际主义精神的《白求恩大夫》，为自由解放而战斗不屈的黑人革命者，如《宁站着死》和《为了解放》，以及鞠躬尽瘁的老革命家《林伯渠》等等。
    60年代以后，赵延年的木刻创作有了新的发展，从1963年创作《离婚》开始，便倾全力为鲁迅的八篇小说作精致的插图。计有《祝福》、《孔乙己》、《药》、《野草》、《伤逝》、《阿Q正传》和《狂人日记》的插图，真可以称得上是木刻插图专家了。他的插图的艺术特点是把文学语言翻译为绘画语言，务求使插图与文学获得一致的风格。他的插图既是文学作品的组成部分，也有其独立性，达到了很高的艺术水平。
    赵延年的木刻以黑白为主。黑白木刻不以花哨的外表炫人，质朴有力，最能显出作者的功力。它是木刻版画的特别艺术语言，也是鲁迅所说具有感人最深的“力之美”的特点。赵延年的黑白木刻是独具一格的。他很重视而且成功地处理画面上的黑白对比关系，因而产生丰富而和谐的节奏，欣赏他的木刻好像听到一首莫扎特的乐章，感到十分愉快。他创造了一种用平刀在木板面上浅铲或轻刮，而用薄皮纸正面印的刀法，在画面上产生一种如中国水墨画在纸上渲染的特殊效果，我们称之为“晕刻”。他运用这种“晕刻”不仅使画面色调柔和，而且在描绘物体的体积和质感中，显出有独特的艺术表现力。鲁迅教导我们，刻木刻要“放刀直干”，赵延年的黑白木刻便是发挥这种放刀直干的精神，因而他十分重视木刻所独具的“刀味”与“木味”，还有印刷的技巧等。
    艺术家的成就不能离开他的思想与技巧两个方面来考察，鲁迅先生曾说过：“美术家固然须有精熟的技工，尤须有进步的思想与高尚的人格。……我们所要求的美术品，是表记中国民族知能最高点的标本，不是水平线以下的思想的平均分数。”
  （《热风·随感录四十三》）赵延年的木刻便能体现鲁迅这段话。像这样一个在当代中国革命的大变革时代中受到锻炼而成长起来的木刻家，实在是我国艺术界不可多得的人才，他的艺术成就也是我国版画界的重大收获。
