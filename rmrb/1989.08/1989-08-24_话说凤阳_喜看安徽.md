Fengyang, in the 14th century, produced a figure named Zhu Yuanzhang. He became the emperor, but what he left behind for Fengyang was "nine years of famine out of ten."

However, the establishment of the People's Republic, especially the ten years of reform, brought a surge of vitality to this impoverished land.

In 1979, under the guidance of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Fengyang farmers implemented the "Household Contract Responsibility System" — family-based contract production, miraculously solving the problem of subsistence in a short period. Comrade Deng Xiaoping enthusiastically praised: "A year of transformation, changing the face."

Fengyang farmers did not rest on their laurels. After achieving subsistence, they advanced towards commercial agriculture. Yang Jinguili, a farmer from Dami Town, had been farming for generations to ensure his family had enough to eat. In the 1980s, in just ten years, he produced over 200,000 kilograms of grain, of which 150,000 kilograms were commercial grain. There are over 11,600 similar specialized farming households in Fengyang County. The county's grain production has increased significantly year by year, reaching 503 million kilograms in 1988, 3.4 times that of 1978.

Driven by the increasingly strong commercial consciousness of the farmers, each person in Fengyang County has 1 mu of economic land; there are over 7,700 specialized livestock and breeding households with hundreds or even thousands of chickens and tens or dozens of pigs; four major fruit economic zones with over 1.8 million fruit trees have been initially formed; artificial fish fry breeding bases, crab fry artificial breeding farms, and mature crab breeding bases have been established, and 96% of the 130,000 mu of water surface suitable for breeding have been developed; the total industrial output value of township enterprises has reached 400 million yuan, 76.6 times that of ten years ago.

Fengyang is a microcosm of Anhui.

More than 40 million Anhui farmers, like those in Fengyang, have completed the reform to achieve subsistence and are now advancing towards commercial agriculture.

— Vigorously develop grain production. In 1988, compared to 1978, Anhui's total grain production increased from 14.826 billion kilograms to 23.1 billion kilograms. In 1987, the commercial rate exceeded 50%. In ten years of reform, excluding the multi-channel circulation part, the grain system alone provided 16.1 billion kilograms of commercial grain to other provinces.

— Develop barren hills, barren waters, and barren beaches. The province has developed and utilized 1.712 million mu of barren hills, 398,000 mu of barren waters, and 348,000 mu of barren beaches. In addition to grain, other agricultural commodities have also seen a significant increase. In 1988, the province's total production of cotton, oil crops, aquatic products, and fruits was 206,000 tons, 881,000 tons, 266,000 tons, and 285,000 tons, respectively. The number of pigs slaughtered and the number of large livestock owned were 9.449 million and 5.243 million, respectively, which are 17 times, 2.7 times, 5 times, 3.1 times, 1.36 times, and 2 times those of 1978.

— Develop the second and third industries and township enterprises. In 1988, the total industrial output value of township enterprises in the province reached 21.5 billion yuan, 21 times that of 1978. Currently, in Anhui's rural areas, one out of every four laborers has separated from planting.

Commercial production requires a complete set of services before, during, and after production to ensure smooth operation and scale formation, which is something that individual households cannot do or do well. The solution for Anhui's rural areas, which practice family-based dispersed operations, is to establish a comprehensive agricultural economic service system. This work began a few years ago and has now established 2,632 township (town) agricultural economic service stations, accounting for 78.8% of the total number of townships (towns) in the province; 13,547 village agricultural economic service groups, accounting for 43.1% of the total number of administrative villages in the province; and more than 7,000 people are engaged in agricultural economic services.

This comprehensive service system has initially shown its enormous role in promoting rural commercial economy. The agricultural economic service station in Sigu Tan Township, Liu'an County, has carried out a full-process service including planning, demonstration, contract signing, technical training, seedling supply, technical and management guidance, packaging, transportation, and sales in the areas of "two grasses" and "two breeds." In just two or three years, it has formed a scale operation based on family operations: the whole township has 1,700 mu of mat grass, 465 mu of tobacco, 42,000 white geese, and 3,150 mu of fish ponds. The agricultural economic service station in Xixi Township, Ningguo County, has carried out comprehensive services for fruit tree planting, making this once-secluded mountain village come to life, and an initial fruit base with a certain scale has been formed.

With the continuous improvement and strengthening of the rural economic comprehensive service system, Anhui's commercial agriculture and the entire rural economy will surely usher in a new situation.

### 话说凤阳  喜看安徽

    话说凤阳  喜看安徽
    凤阳，14世纪出过一个朱元璋。他当了皇帝，但留给凤阳的却是“10年倒有9年荒”。
    然而，人民共和国的成立特别是10年改革，给这块贫穷的土地带来了勃勃生机。
    1979年，在党的十一届三中全会精神指引下，凤阳农民实行“大包干”——家庭联产承包制，神奇般地迅速解决了温饱问题。邓小平同志热情赞扬：“一年翻身，改变面貌。”
    凤阳农民没有满足现状，他们在实现温饱后，又向商品农业挺进。大庙镇农民杨锦礼，祖祖辈辈种地都是为一家人有粮吃。进入80年代后，10年里他收粮20多万公斤，其中15万多公斤是商品粮。类似杨锦礼的种粮专业户，凤阳县有11600多户。全县粮食年年大幅度增产，1988年总产量达到5.03亿公斤，是1978年的3.4倍。
    在日益强烈的农民商品意识驱动下，凤阳县人均有了1亩经济田；出现了养鸡几百、几千只，养猪20、30头的畜牧、养殖专业户7700多户；初步形成了拥有180多万棵果树的4大果品经济区；建成了人工繁殖鱼苗基地、蟹苗人工繁殖场、成蟹养殖基地，13万多亩可养水面的96％被开发；乡镇企业总产值达到4亿元，是10年前的76.6倍。
    凤阳，是安徽的缩影。
    4000多万安徽农民像凤阳农民一样在完成实现温饱的改革后，又跃动在通往商品农业的阶梯上。
    ——大力发展粮食生产。1988年与1978年比，安徽省粮食总产量由148.26亿公斤增加到231亿公斤。1987年商品率突破50％。改革10年，不含多渠道流通部分，仅粮食系统就向省外提供商品粮161亿公斤。
    ——开发荒坡、荒水、荒滩。全省已开发利用荒坡171.2万亩、荒水39.8万亩、荒滩34.8万亩。粮食以外的其它农业商品，也出现了大增长趋势。1988年，全省棉花、油料、水产品和水果总产分别为20.6万吨、88.1万吨、26.6万吨和28.5万吨，生猪出栏和大牲畜拥有量分别为944.9万头和524.3万头，分别是1978年的17倍、2.7倍、5倍、3.1倍、1.36倍和2倍。
    ——发展第二、三产业，发展乡镇企业。1988年，全省乡镇企业总产值达到215亿元，是1978年的21倍。目前，安徽农村4个劳力中已有1个从种植业中分离出来。
    商品生产，要有产前、产中、产后一整套服务作保证才能顺利进行，形成规模，而这是一家一户办不到或办不好的。实行家庭分散经营的安徽农村，解决这个问题的办法，是建立农村经济综合服务体系。这项工作几年前就开始了，现已建乡（镇）农经服务站2632个，为全省乡（镇）总数的78.8％；建村农经服务组13547个，是全省行政村总数的43.1％；从事农经服务的人员已有7000多人。
    这个综合服务体系，初步显示出推进农村商品经济的巨大作用。六安县思古潭乡农经服务站在“两草”、“两养”上开展了包括规划、示范、签订合同、培训技术、种苗供应、技术和管理指导、包装、托运、经销等全过程服务，仅两三年就形成了在家庭经营基础上的规模经营：全乡种席草1700亩，种烟草465亩，养白鹅4.2万只，养鱼3150亩水面。宁国霞西乡农经服务站开展果树栽培综合服务，使这个往日闭塞的山乡活了起来，一个初具规模的水果基地已经形成。
    随着农村经济综合服务体系的不断完善和强化，安徽省的商品农业乃至整个农村经济，必将出现新的局面。
