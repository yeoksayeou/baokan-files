A new pesticide product, chlorpyrifos, had long been delayed in entering the market. By the end of last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Institute of Pesticides, which developed this achievement, established a science and technology development base. In just over three months, it completed the pilot test and produced high-quality products. Now, the institute has transferred the complete production technology and process of chlorpyrifos to enterprises, expanding commercial production.

Currently, Jiangsu Province has established science and technology development bases in institutes of electronics, textiles, chemicals, machinery, aquaculture, and other fields. These bases are equipped with relatively advanced pilot testing equipment and specialized technical and production personnel, capable of rapidly completing pilot tests and production trials of some new scientific and technological achievements, continuously providing new technologies and products suitable for industrial production to factories.

To strengthen the intermediate link between science and technology and the economy, the Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Commission decided to use the scientific research funds and part of the scientific research funds and scientific turnover funds saved by research institutes, along with matching funds raised by the base-building units, to gradually establish a number of advanced-equipped, technologically superior science and technology development bases across the province, accelerating the promotion and application of scientific and technological achievements.

Over the past year, the province has raised 12.83 million yuan and established science and technology development bases in 15 research institutes and one factory. These bases are built in line with the needs of Jiangsu Province's key industries for scientific and technological economic development, focusing on the development of new technologies and key technologies in industrial technological transformation, as well as the scientific and technological development of agricultural and sideline products and daily necessities closely related to people's lives. In approving base projects, priority is given to supporting science and technology bases with mature technological achievements, good basic conditions, quick start-up, short cycles, and good economic benefits.

    强化科技经济结合的中间环节
    江苏建立科技开发基地
    据新华社南京8月2日电　（记者徐机玲）一种农药新产品氯菊酯，曾经迟迟不能投放市场。去年底，研制这一成果的江苏省农药研究所建立了科技开发基地，仅3个多月就完成中试，生产出优质产品。现在，这家研究所已将氯菊酯的全套生产技术和工艺转让给企业，扩大了商品化生产。
    目前，江苏省已在电子、纺织、化工、机械、水产等研究所建立了科技开发基地。这些基地装备有较先进的中试设备和专长技术、生产人员，能够迅速完成一些科技新成果的中试和生产性试验，源源不断地向工厂提供适应工业化生产的新技术、新产品。
    为了强化科技与经济结合的中间环节，江苏省科委决定以研究院所削减下来的科学事业费和一部分科技攻关经费、科学周转金为基金，加上基地建设单位自筹的配套资金，逐步在全省建立一批装备先进、技术优良的科技开发基地，加快科技成果的推广应用。
    去年以来，全省已集资1283万元，先后在15个科研所和一家工厂建立了科技开发基地。这些基地建设结合江苏省重点行业科技经济发展的需要，重点发展新兴技术和行业技术改造中的关键技术，以及与人民生活密切相关的农副产品、生活必需品的科技开发。在审批基地项目时，重点支持技术成果成熟、基础条件好、上马快、周期短、经济效益好的科技基地。
