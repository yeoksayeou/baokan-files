The Jewels of Bohai Sparkle: A Batch of Flagship Products Emerges

Beijing-brand color TVs, Flying Pigeon bicycles, Sea Gull watches, Xiali sedans, Xinda motorcycles, Kelon refrigerators, Canon copiers, submersible electric pumps... Over the past 40 years, these products with strong vitality have been like jewels embedded along the Bohai coast, shining brightly and emitting dazzling light. By adhering to adjustment, transformation, and introduction, Tianjin, this old industrial base, has regained its vigor.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Tianjin has undergone large-scale technological transformation and introduction, making its industrial and product structures more reasonable. Fruits are already visible: the 18 industries, including machinery, electronics, metallurgy, chemicals, light industry, and textiles, that have undergone key adjustments and transformations have shown their advantages and produced a batch of high-tech, energy-efficient, and high-value-added flagship products.

Consumer goods in urgent market demand include cars, motorcycles, TVs, tape recorders, refrigerators, washing machines, bicycles, vacuum cleaners, and air conditioners; advantageous and promising equipment products include submersible electric pumps, forging and pressing equipment, numerical control machine tools, machining centers, small TVs, reducers, refrigerator compressors, and elevators; urgently needed major basic raw materials include coal tar processing products, cold-rolled thin plates, ion membrane caustic soda, soda ash, flat glass, polyvinyl chloride resin, and glass fiber products; high-tech products include VCRs, fax machines, fiber-optic communications, programmable control telephones, copiers, and programmable controllers. These products either have already formed a certain scale of production or are already in a leading position. In international and domestic competitions, they have won one gold medal after another for Tianjin. Adjustment, transformation, and introduction have raised Tianjin's industrial level to a new stage. Experts analyze that the large-scale technological introduction and transformation in the past five years have at least advanced Tianjin's industrial technology level by 10 to 15 years, from the level of the 1950s and 1960s to the level of the 1970s and 1980s in China or internationally. Flagship products, as leaders, not only promote product upgrades and quality improvements but also drive the transformation and adjustment of a batch of industries, thus forming an overall advantage to participate in domestic and international competitions. By now, Tianjin has seen 112 such enterprises and general factories that form a complete set of products.

    渤海明珠放异彩
    一批拳头产品崭露头角
    本报讯　北京牌彩电、飞鸽自行车、海鸥手表、夏利轿车、迅达摩托车、可耐冰箱、佳能复印机、潜油电泵……40年来，这一项项有强大生命力的拳头产品，犹如一颗颗镶嵌在渤海岸边的明珠，交相辉映，放射出夺目的光彩。坚持调整、改造、引进，使天津这个老工业基地焕发出勃勃生机。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，天津通过较大规模的技术改造和技术引进，产业和产品结构更趋合理，枝头已见硕果：经过重点调整和改造的机械、电子、冶金、化工、轻工、纺织等十八个行业已显示出优势，并涌现出一批技术水平高、能源原材料消耗少、附加价值大的拳头产品。
    市场急需的消费品已有汽车、摩托车、电视机、录音机、电冰箱、洗衣机、自行车、吸尘器、空调器等；有优势有后劲的装备类产品已有潜油电泵、锻压设备、数控机床、加工中心、中小型电视、减速机、冰箱压缩机、电梯等；急缺的主要基础原材料产品已有焦油加工制品、冷轧薄板、离子膜烧碱、纯碱、平板玻璃、聚氯乙烯糊树脂、玻璃纤维制品等；高技术产品已有录像机、文传机、光纤通讯、程控电话、复印机可编程序控制器等。这些产品或已形成一定批量，或已居于领先地位，在国际、国内的评比中，为津城捧回了一块又一块金牌。调整、改造、引进使天津工业水平跨上了新的台阶。有关行家分析说，近五年大规模技术引进和技术改造，至少使天津工业技术水平平均前进10至15年，即由五六十年代水平，提高到国内或国际七八十年代水平。拳头产品作为龙头，不仅促进了产品的升级换代和质量的提高，还带动了一批行业的改造、调整，从而形成整体优势，参与国内外竞争。到目前，天津已出现这种成龙配套的企业公司、总厂112个。　张颖　穆秀荣
