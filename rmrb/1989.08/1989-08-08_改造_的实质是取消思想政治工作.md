The "reform" of ideological and political work is essentially the abolition of ideological and political work. The turmoil that began with student protests and escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot in the capital has caused us immense losses and profound lessons. The most crucial point, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has deeply pointed out, is that the biggest mistake of the past decade is the weakness in educating the people and conducting ideological and political work. Now, people are increasingly aware that the most direct and fundamental domestic cause of this turmoil is the lack of consistent adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, and the severe spread of bourgeois liberalization. Over a period of time, the relaxation and weakening of ideological and political work have exacerbated and tolerated this situation. Comrade Zhao Ziyang, under the pretext of "adaptation," proposed "reforming ideological and political work," which objectively negated the party's excellent traditions in ideological and political work and aimed to abolish the role of ideological and political work. This article attempts to provide an initial analysis of the essence of "reform" and the consequences and harm it has caused.

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee marked the shift of the party's work focus to economic construction, signaling that our country has entered a new historical period with economic construction as the center. The Central Committee, on the one hand, is committed to the cause of reform and opening up, leading the people of the whole country to focus on modernization construction. On the other hand, it requires the party to fully play its political advantages, strengthen spiritual civilization construction, and improve the ideological and moral quality of the entire nation. During this period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized that ideological and political work can only be strengthened, not weakened, and required us to study new situations and solve new problems under new historical conditions. Some important party documents also proposed to continuously strengthen and improve ideological and political work. Comrade Zhao Ziyang, disregarding the party's scientific propositions on ideological and political work under new conditions, came up with the idea of "reforming ideological and political work." "Improvement" and "reform" differ by only one character, but there is a fundamental difference. What we mean by "improvement" is to reform and innovate on the basis of inheriting excellent traditions, to better adapt to new situations and strengthen ideological and political work. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's "reform," however, is to negate the excellent traditions of ideological and political work and to start anew, which can only lead to the weakening of ideological and political work.

It should be noted that when Comrade Zhao Ziyang proposed "reforming ideological and political work," he deliberately quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's famous slogan of "reforming our study," attempting to use it as his theoretical basis. In fact, "reforming our study" and "reforming ideological and political work" are completely incomparable. Our party proposed "reforming our study" during the Yan'an period, targeting the prevalent dogmatism, subjectivism, and party jargon within the party, which were anti-scientific and anti-Marxist. The goal was to completely break away from these and establish a new style of learning that is practical and combines theory with practice. Comrade Zhao Ziyang proposed "reforming ideological and political work" after the party had rectified and thoroughly cleared the "leftist" influences in ideological and political work, and after the guiding ideology of ideological and political work had been corrected. It was at a time when ideological and political work was neglected, bourgeois liberalization was rampant in various fields, and party ideological and political work urgently needed to be strengthened. Under these circumstances, proposing "reform" seemed to be "very thorough" and "full of pioneering spirit," but in reality, it was a misjudgment of the situation and the historical and current state of ideological and political work, catering to the political needs of those advocating bourgeois liberalization.

Undoubtedly, for a long time, especially during the ten years of turmoil, taking class struggle as the key link, frequent political campaigns, and frequent, excessive, and erroneous struggles within the party and among the people have caused serious consequences. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, for a period of time, our party and the field of ideological and political work emphasized opposing "leftist" tendencies and eliminating "leftist" influences, which was correct. This work is still ongoing. The new situation of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy has brought many new situations and problems to ideological and political work, and there is indeed a question of how to adapt to the development of the situation and continuously strengthen and improve ideological and political work. However, our emphasis on abandoning the old "leftist" practices and adapting to new situations and solving new problems does not mean negating the excellent traditions and successful experiences of ideological and political work formed in the long-term revolutionary struggle and construction practice. Adhering to the party's leadership and the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly; adhering to the education of the masses with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the party's correct line; adhering to the combination of theory and practice and the mass line; adhering to the education of patriotism, revolutionary heroism, and hard work; adhering to the combination of ideological work with other professional work; adhering to the core leadership role of the party committee, the fighting fortress role of the party branch, and the vanguard and model role of party members, and continuously strengthening the construction of party organizations, etc. These principles and traditions reflect the essence of our party, are the most vital principles and content of ideological and political work, and are our true advantage. They must be inherited and carried forward at any time. If we follow Comrade Zhao Ziyang's intention to "reform" ideological and political work and discard all these excellent traditions, people will lose a strong spiritual pillar, political beliefs will be shaken, ideological and moral standards will decline, and the concept of law and discipline will fade, causing great damage to the stable and united political situation and bringing heavy losses to the cause of reform and construction. The harsh facts of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot fully illustrate this point.

A program or an important slogan is a flag openly raised. A correct slogan can play a role in uniting people's hearts, boosting morale, and guiding the direction. An incorrect slogan will cause confusion in ideological theory, deviation in public opinion guidance, and serious mistakes in work. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's proposal of "reforming ideological and political work" is to openly raise a flag. Raising this flag is both the inevitable result of his long-term neglect of ideological and political work and the beginning of his further negation of the party's excellent traditions in ideological and political work and the abolition of ideological and political work. Regardless of his intentions, the fact we see is that under the influence of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's propositions and slogans, the work in the ideological field has been relaxed, the political cadre team has dispersed, and proletarian ideological positions have been lost in many units. The consequences are extremely serious.

Consequence one: The ideological and political education of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles has been relaxed. In early 1987, Comrade Zhao Ziyang publicly proposed at a party meeting that in the future, the Four Cardinal Principles mainly emphasize the party's leadership, and the other three can be mentioned less or not at all. He also said that no one can clearly explain what the socialist road is now. Such remarks actually emboldened those who opposed the Four Cardinal Principles and advocated bourgeois liberalization. For a period of time, the Four Cardinal Principles were not used as the theme of ideological and political education for the people, but only as a "standard language" quoted in documents, even viewed by some as "clichés" and "empty talk." Not only that, many who adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles and propagated Marxism-Leninism were ridiculed, while those who advocated bourgeois liberalization were popular, and even some party newspapers, some institutions of higher learning that cultivate new socialist people, became places to spread bourgeois liberalization. Due to the relaxation of the ideological education of the Four Cardinal Principles, some people's weakening of spiritual pillars and loss of national spirit were particularly prominent. They placed the future and hope of the state on the capitalist system of the West, rather than closely linking the fate and future of the motherland with the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. The painful lesson tells us that the ideological and political education of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization must never be relaxed, otherwise, a historical mistake will be made.

Consequence two: The leadership of the party has been diluted. The practice of reform and opening up has once again proven that to promote socialist modernization construction, we must strengthen and improve the party's leadership. However, as the main leader of the party, Comrade Zhao Ziyang paid little attention to party building. At a meeting to strengthen party building, he was asked to speak and he said it was like "forcing a duck onto a stage." Due to neglecting party building, the role of the party has been significantly diluted. For a time, society circulated sayings such as "freedom party," "opposition party," and "underground party," which, although were the grievances of a few people, also showed how weak and dispersed the party organization had become. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently admonished the whole party: "We must concentrate on party building. This party must be built, and it cannot be neglected anymore." This is also one of the important conclusions drawn from reflecting on this turmoil.

Consequence three: The status and role of ideological and political work have been degraded. Undoubtedly, in the primary stage of socialism, developing productive forces is the most fundamental task. However, the development of production and the improvement of material civilization do not mean that people's ideological awareness will naturally improve, and spiritual civilization will naturally be built. However, in recent years, Comrade Zhao Ziyang has seriously neglected the construction of spiritual civilization and ideological and political work, directly leading to the continuous decline of the status and role of political work. Ideological and political work is the lifeline of economic work and all other work, but it is not mentioned, and some even think that ideological and political work is ineffective, and "a basket of big principles" is not as good as "a piece of unity." Some factories and enterprises have the situation of "the manager is not in place, the secretary is afraid to overstep, and ideological and political work has no place." Especially in some institutions of higher learning, the weakening of ideological and political work is more serious, and Marxist theoretical education is viewed as an "extra burden," regarded as a troublesome thing of "not learning is not good, learning is not effective," while the bizarre theories and other erroneous trends of advocating bourgeois liberalization are highly favored. We should see: China is a developing socialist country, the task of economic construction is quite heavy, and the people's desire to improve their living standards as soon as possible is very strong. Under these historical conditions, it is necessary to make great efforts to develop economic construction, which is an unshakable task. However, socialist modernization construction is not just a concept of material production and science and technology, it is a process of social development and progress. In this process, if we only focus on the economy and neglect and relax the construction of spiritual civilization and ideological and political work, it completely violates the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, not only making it difficult to develop productive forces, but also leading to unimaginable consequences.

Consequence four: Ideological and moral construction has been severely weakened. High ideals, firm revolutionary beliefs, good moral customs, and selfless dedication have always been our party's precious wealth and the core content of our ideological and moral construction. However, it is regrettable that in recent years, we have not done a good job of using these ideologies to educate our party members and the people. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's proposal of the "reform" theory has played a role in adding fuel to the fire of neglecting ideological and moral construction, aggravating the "reverse psychology" of some people towards ideological education. Some people's beliefs in socialism and communism have wavered; the idea of money first, pursuing material enjoyment and personal fame and fortune has grown; the spirit of hard work, selflessness, and helping others that embodies the noble qualities of communists and the traditional virtues of the Chinese people has gradually faded. In real life, serving the people is rarely mentioned, and the people's servants are rarely mentioned. The spirit of Lei Feng is considered "outdated." On the contrary, individualism is being "rehabilitated," and selflessness is being "criticized" openly. Whoever talks about communist ideals is considered "transcending" and "singing high notes." The extreme individualist slogans of "ideals, ideals, think of benefits," "future, future, think of money" have a market among some people. Especially in some institutions of higher learning, the goal of cultivating people is extremely vague, and the phenomenon of valuing talent over virtue is quite serious. In this turmoil, many of the people we have cultivated oppose us, and those we value curse us. This lesson is very profound.

Consequence five: The principles of ideological and political work have been abandoned. One of the important reasons for the weakness of ideological and political work in recent years is that the principles of ideological and political work have not been well maintained, or in many aspects, this principle has been abandoned. Originally, daring to criticize and self-criticize is our party's tradition and a basic characteristic that distinguishes our party from other parties, and it is also a symbol of the fighting spirit of ideological and political work. But some people are very opposed to this, and when they hear criticism and self-criticism, they feel it is unpleasant. Therefore, correct things cannot be advocated boldly, and wrong things cannot be opposed clearly. Some units, in the face of the spread of bourgeois liberalization, not only do not firmly resist, but also give various reasons to allow bourgeois liberalization to spread. Some people, under the pretext of "updating concepts," relax the struggle in the ideological field, lose vigilance against feudal and capitalist decadent thoughts, and cause many positions on the ideological front to be unoccupied by the proletariat. In recent years, the spread of bourgeois liberalization, pornography, murder, and feudal superstition and other spiritual poisons has been rampant, causing serious spiritual pollution and corrupting the younger generation. Many parents and teachers have called out "save the children" and "save the youth." The facts have proven that under the conditions of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy, various social trends are coming in waves. If ideological and political work does not adhere to high principles, it will lose its backbone and will inevitably lose its direction.

Consequence six: The construction of the ideological and political work team has been severely neglected. Ideological and political work is a science, and only by establishing a team of relatively high-quality professional cadres can this work be effectively carried out. However, Comrade Zhao Ziyang does not pay attention to the construction of this team. In recent years, some units have political cadres not in place, and even those in place cannot concentrate on ideological work, and some party secretaries and branch secretaries of quite a few units cannot correctly perform their duties. The slogan of "reducing political cadres by half, production can double" has even appeared in public. Of course, ideological and political work should be done by a wide range of party members, cadres, and the masses, and cannot rely solely on increasing many professional political cadres. However, in the process of reform and opening up, interest relations are constantly adjusted, and there are many social contradictions, making ideological and political work very arduous and complex. To implement ideological and political work at the grassroots level, a political work team is needed, and it cannot be done without the hard work of a wide range of political cadres. Various levels of party organizations must clarify their position and role in ideological and political work and effectively strengthen the construction of the ideological and political work team, especially the party secretaries should use their main energy to do ideological and political work.

The problems that have arisen in ideological and political work are complex and are closely related to the international "big environment" and the domestic "small environment." However, it cannot be ignored that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's proposal of the "reform" slogan and his neglect of ideological and political work have had a detrimental impact on ideological and political work. Although some documents on ideological and political work have been issued in recent years, overall, ideological and political work is in a trend of being weakened. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's proposal of the "reform" slogan is not isolated but is consistent with his passive attitude towards the Four Cardinal Principles, his opposition to the policy of opposing bourgeois liberalization, and his serious neglect of party building and spiritual civilization construction. In short, he uses "reform" as a name but negates it in reality. Some old comrades in our party have been alert to this and have criticized Comrade Zhao Ziyang's proposal of "reform." The leaders of the Military Commission have clearly pointed out that the army should still talk about improvement and reform, not "reform." Some grassroots cadres directly engaged in ideological and political work have also publicly expressed their dissatisfaction, and some have named names, saying, "Isn't it said that ideological and political work needs to be reformed? Let Zhao Ziyang reform it for us to see." Facing the opposition to "reform" from top to bottom, Comrade Zhao Ziyang does not listen and still justifies himself: reform, reform, and improvement are the same meaning, using this to defend his mistakes.

We oppose Comrade Zhao Ziyang's proposal of "reforming" ideological and political work, not to say that political work does not need to be improved and reformed. To do a good job of ideological and political work in the new situation, we must follow the consistent thinking of the Central Committee of the party. First, we must strengthen it, and second, we must improve it. Under the current situation where ideological and political work has been severely weakened, the primary task is to strengthen it and widely carry out education on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and patriotism, socialism, independence, self-reliance, and hard work. Only in this way can we fully play our political advantages. At the same time, ideological and political work must also be improved. Only by improving can it be truly strengthened. In the new historical period, the objective environment has changed, the situation and tasks have changed, the working objects have changed, and the content and methods of ideological and political work must also change accordingly, exploring and summarizing new experiences, and broadening the channels of ideological and political work. If we completely copy the original traditions and experiences of ideological and political work, we will not be able to meet today's requirements and will not be able to have a strong vitality. In this sense, if ideological and political work does not improve, it will have no way out, if it does not innovate, it will lack vitality, and if it does not reform, excellent traditions will not be truly inherited. Therefore, we must continue to emancipate our minds, adhere to Marxism and the basic line of the party as guidance, follow the principle of "respecting history, standing on reality, and looking to the future," and seriously study and explore the characteristics and laws of ideological and political work under new historical conditions, continuously create new forms and methods, and make ideological and political work have a great development.

    “改造”的实质是取消思想政治工作
    龚彦涛
    这次由学潮到动乱以至在首都发生反革命暴乱，给我们造成的损失是巨大的，教训也是十分深刻的。其中最重要的一点，就是邓小平同志所深刻指出的，十年最大的失误是对人民的教育和思想政治工作薄弱了。现在人们已经越来越清楚地看到，导致这场动乱，就国内来说，最直接、最根本的原因，是坚持四项基本原则不够一贯，资产阶级自由化思潮严重泛滥。而一个时期以来，放松和削弱思想政治工作，又助长和纵容了这种状况的恶性发展。赵紫阳同志借口“适应”，提出“改造思想政治工作”，客观上起到了否定党的思想政治工作的优良传统，取消思想政治工作的作用。本文试图就“改造”的实质和它所造成的后果与危害，作初步的剖析。
    党的十一届三中全会实现了全党工作重点的转移，标志着我们国家进入了以经济建设为中心的新的历史时期。党中央一方面致力于改革开放的大业，领导全国人民一心一意地搞现代化建设，另一方面又要求全党充分发挥政治优势，加强精神文明建设，提高全民族的思想道德素质。在这期间，邓小平同志多次强调思想政治工作只能加强，不能削弱，并要求我们结合新的历史条件，研究新情况，解决新问题。党的一些重要文件，也提出要不断加强和改进思想政治工作。赵紫阳同志不顾我们党对新形势下思想政治工作的科学提法，别出心裁，标新立异，打出了“改造思想政治工作”的旗号。“改进”与“改造”，虽只一字之差，但有着原则的区别。我们所说的“改进”，其实质是在继承优良传统的基础上改革创新，是为了更好地适应新的情况，加强思想政治工作，而赵紫阳同志的“改造”，实际上是否定思想政治工作的优良传统，是要推倒重来，另起炉灶，其结果只能是导致思想政治工作的削弱。
    这里需要指出的是，赵紫阳同志在提“改造思想政治工作”时，特意引用了毛泽东同志提出过的“改造我们的学习”这个著名口号，企图以此作为他的理论注脚。事实上，“改造我们的学习”与“改造思想政治工作”是完全不能相提并论的。我们党在延安时期提出“改造我们的学习”，是针对当时党内盛行的教条主义、主观主义和党八股等反科学、反马克思主义的不良学风提出来的，旨在与之彻底决裂，树立实事求是、理论联系实际的全新学风。而赵紫阳同志提出“改造思想政治工作”，是在全党经过拨乱反正、认真清理思想政治工作的“左”的影响、思想政治工作的指导思想已经端正之后；是在思想政治工作受到忽视，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥于各个领域，党的思想政治工作亟需大力加强的时候。在这种情况下提出“改造”，表面看起来似乎“很彻底”，“富有开拓精神”，实际上是对形势的发展和思想政治工作的历史与现状作了错误的估计，迎合了搞资产阶级自由化那伙人的政治需要。
    毋庸置疑，长期以来，特别是在十年动乱中，以阶级斗争为纲，政治运动不断，在党内和人民内部实行频繁的、过火的、错误的斗争，造成了严重的恶果。在党的十一届三中全会以后一段时间里，我们党和思想政治工作领域里强调反对“左”的倾向和消除“左”的影响，是正确的。这个工作现在也还在做。改革开放、发展社会主义商品经济的新形势，使思想政治工作遇到了许多新的情况和问题，思想政治工作也确有一个如何适应形势的发展变化，不断加强和改进的问题。但是，我们强调摒弃过去一套“左”的做法，强调适应新情况，解决新问题，丝毫也不意味着否定在长期革命斗争和建设实践中形成的思想政治工作的优良传统和成功经验。坚持党的领导和全心全意为人民服务的宗旨；坚持用马列主义、毛泽东思想和党的正确路线教育群众；坚持理论联系实际和群众路线；坚持爱国主义、革命英雄主义、艰苦奋斗的教育；坚持思想工作结合其他业务工作一道去做；坚持发挥党委的核心领导作用、党支部的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用，不断加强党组织的建设，等等。这些原则和传统，反映了我们党的本质，是思想政治工作最富有生命力的原则和内容，是我们的真正优势所在，任何时候都必须继承和发扬。如果按照赵紫阳同志的意图，对思想政治工作来一番脱胎换骨的“改造”，把这些优良传统全都抛弃了，人们就会失去坚强的精神支柱，政治信念就会动摇，思想道德水准就会下降，法制纪律观念就会淡漠，就会给安定团结的政治局面造成极大的破坏，给改革和建设事业带来重大的损失。这场动乱和反革命暴乱的严酷事实就充分说明了这一点。
    一个纲领或一个重要口号的提出，就是一面公开树立起来的旗帜。正确的口号能够起到凝聚人心、振奋民气、指引方向的作用。错误的口号则会造成思想理论上的混乱，舆论导向上的偏离，工作上的严重失误。赵紫阳同志提出“改造思想政治工作”的口号，就是公开树起了一面旗帜，树起这面旗帜，既是他长期轻视思想政治工作的必然结果，又是他进一步否定党的思想政治工作优良传统、取消思想政治工作的新的开端。不管他的用意如何，我们见到的事实是，在赵紫阳同志的主张和口号的影响下，意识形态领域的工作放松了，政治干部队伍涣散了，在相当多的单位无产阶级思想阵地丧失了。其后果是极其严重的。
    后果之一：坚持四项基本原则的思想政治教育被放松。1987年初，赵紫阳同志在党内一次会议上公然提出，今后四个坚持主要是坚持党的领导，其他三项可以不提或者少提。他还说，什么是社会主义道路现在谁也讲不清。这种论调实际上是给那些反对四项基本原则，搞资产阶级自由化的人壮胆张目。一个时期以来，没有把四项基本原则作为思想政治工作的主题来教育人民，只是当作一种“标准语言”引用在文件上，甚至被一些人视为“套话、空话”。不仅如此，许多坚持四项基本原则、宣传马列主义的人受到讽刺挖苦，而一些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人却很吃香，甚至一些党的报刊，一些培育社会主义新人的院校讲坛，成了散布资产阶级自由化的园地。由于放松四项基本原则的思想教育，在一些人中，精神支柱的削弱和民族精神的失落表现得极为突出。他们中的一些人把国家的前途和希望寄托在西方的资本主义制度上，而不是把祖国的命运和前途同共产党的领导、同社会主义制度紧密联系起来。沉痛的教训告诉我们，坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的思想政治教育，任何时候都不能放松，否则就要犯历史性的错误。
    后果之二：党的领导被淡化。改革开放的实践再次证明，推进社会主义现代化建设，必须大力加强和改进党的领导。但是，作为党的主要领导人的赵紫阳同志，对党的建设却极少过问。在一次加强党的建设的会议上请他讲话，他竟说这是“赶着鸭子上架”。由于忽视党的建设，党的作用明显淡化。一时社会上流传的什么“自由党”、“在野党”、“地下党”的说法，尽管是少数人的一些牢骚话，但也足以说明党组织的软弱涣散到了何等严重的程度。邓小平同志在不久前谆谆告诫全党：“要聚精会神地抓党的建设，这个党该抓了，不抓不行了。”这也是反思这场风波获得的重要结论之一。
    后果之三：思想政治工作的地位和作用被贬低。毫无疑问，在社会主义初级阶段，发展社会生产力是最根本的任务。但是，生产发展了，物质文明搞上去了，决不等于人们的思想觉悟就自然而然地提高了，精神文明就自然而然地建设起来了。可是，这些年来，赵紫阳同志严重忽视精神文明建设和思想政治工作，直接导致了政治工作的地位一降再降，作用一贬再贬。思想政治工作是经济工作和其他一切工作的生命线不提了，有的甚至认为思想政治工作不灵了，“大道理一筐”不如“大团结一张”。一些工厂企业出现了“厂长不到位，书记怕越位，思想政治工作没有位”的状况。尤其是在一些高等院校，思想政治工作被削弱的程度更为严重，马克思主义理论教育被视为“额外负担”，当作是“不学不行，学了不灵”的麻烦事，而宣扬资产阶级自由化的奇谈怪论和其他错误思潮倍受青睐。我们应当看到：中国是一个发展中的社会主义国家，经济建设的任务相当繁重，人民要求尽快提高生活水平的愿望十分强烈，在这种历史条件下，下大力把经济建设搞上去，是必须坚定不移的。但是，社会主义现代化建设决不仅仅是一个物质生产的概念、科学技术的概念，它是一个社会发展、社会进步的过程。在这个过程中，如果就经济抓经济，而忽视和放松精神文明建设和思想政治工作，就完全违背了建设有中国特色的社会主义的本质要求，不仅社会生产力难以发展，而且会导致不堪设想的后果。
    后果之四：思想道德建设被严重削弱。崇高的理想追求，坚定的革命信念，良好的道德风尚，无私的奉献精神，无论过去和现在都是我们党的宝贵财富，是我们思想道德建设最核心的内容。但是，令人痛心的是这些年来我们没有很好地用这些思想教育我们的党员和人民。赵紫阳同志提出的“改造”论，对这种忽视思想道德建设的倾向起了火上加油的作用，加重了少数人对思想教育的“逆反心理”。一些人对社会主义、共产主义的信念发生动摇；金钱至上、追求物质享受和个人名利的思想有所滋长；艰苦奋斗、大公无私、助人为乐等体现共产党人高贵品质和中国人民传统美德的思想逐渐淡漠。在现实生活中为人民服务很少讲了，人民公仆很少提了，雷锋精神被认为是
  “过时”了。相反，却要为个人主义“正名”，要公开“批评”大公无私，谁讲共产主义理想就被认为是“超越”、“唱高调”。
  “理想理想，有利就想”，“前途前途，有钱就图”等极端个人主义的论调，在一些人中很有市场。尤其在一些高等院校，培养人的目标极为模糊，重才轻德的现象相当严重。在这次动乱中，不少我们培养的人反对我们，我们器重的人咒骂我们。这个教训是极为深刻的。
    后果之五：思想政治工作原则性被放弃。这几年，思想政治工作薄弱的一个重要原因，就是没有很好地坚持思想政治工作的原则性，或者说在很多方面放弃了这个原则。本来勇于批评与自我批评，是我们党的传统，是我们党区别于其他政党的一个基本特征，也是思想政治工作具有战斗力的象征。但一些人对此却非常反感，一讲批评与自我批评，就觉得刺耳。因此，正确的东西不能理直气壮地提倡，错误的东西不能旗帜鲜明地反对。有些单位在资产阶级自由化已经出现的情况下，不仅不进行坚决有力的抵制，还以种种理由给资产阶级自由化泛滥开绿灯。还有一些人借口“观念更新”，放松意识形态领域里的斗争，对封建主义、资本主义的腐朽思想丧失警惕，致使思想战线的许多阵地没有被无产阶级所占领。这几年，宣传资产阶级自由化，传播色情、淫秽、凶杀、封建迷信等精神毒品泛滥成灾，造成严重的精神污染，腐蚀着青少年一代。不少家长、教师发出“救救孩子”，“救救青少年”的呼吁。事实证明，在改革开放、发展社会主义商品经济条件下，各种社会思潮纷至沓来，思想政治工作如果不坚持高度的原则性，就没有主心骨，就必然会迷失方向。
    后果之六：思想政治工作队伍建设被严重忽视。思想政治工作是一门科学，只有建立一支较高素质的专职队伍，才能从组织上保证把这项工作做出成效来。但赵紫阳同志对这支队伍的建设却“不以为然”。这几年，有的单位政治干部不在位，有的在位也不能专心致志地做思想工作，甚至有相当一些单位的党委书记、支部书记不能正确地履行职责。“政工干部减一半，生产就能翻一番”的论调竟然公开见诸报端。当然，思想政治工作要靠广大党团员、广大干部、广大群众去做，不能只靠增加很多政治工作专职干部。但是，在改革开放过程中，利益关系不断调整，各种社会矛盾很多，思想政治工作十分艰巨复杂，要使思想政治工作落实到基层，没有一支政工队伍，不依靠广大政工干部的辛勤工作，是不行的。各级党组织必须明确自己在思想政治工作中的地位和作用，切实抓好思想政治工作队伍建设，特别是党委书记要用主要精力做思想政治工作。
    思想政治工作出现的这些问题，原因是复杂的，是与国际
  “大气候”和国内“小气候”紧密联系着的。但也不能不看到，赵紫阳同志提出“改造”的口号及其对思想政治工作的轻视，对思想政治工作造成了恶劣的影响。这几年虽然也发过一些有关思想政治工作的文件，但总的看，思想政治工作处于被削弱的趋势。赵紫阳同志提出“改造”的口号绝不是孤立的，而是与他消极对待四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设的思想一脉相承的。说穿了，他是以“改造”为名，行否定之实。对此，我们党内的一些老同志是有警觉的，对赵紫阳同志“改造”的提法提出过批评。军委的领导同志曾经明确指出，军队还是提改进、改革，不要讲
  “改造”。直接从事思想政治工作的一些基层干部也公开表示过不满，有的指名道姓地讲，“不是讲思想政治工作要改造吗？叫赵紫阳改造一下给我们看看”。面对上上下下对“改造”的反对声，赵紫阳同志却听不进去，还自圆其说：改造、改革、改进是一个意思，以此来为自己的错误辩解。
    我们否定赵紫阳同志对思想政治工作进行“改造”的提法，并不是说政治工作就不需要改进、改革了。做好新形势下的思想政治工作，必须按照党中央的一贯思想，一要加强，二要改进。在当前思想政治工作受到严重削弱的情况下，第一位的任务是要加强，要广泛进行坚持四项基本原则和爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗的教育。只有这样，才能充分发挥我们的政治优势。同时，思想政治工作又要改进，只有改进，才能真正加强。在新的历史时期，客观环境变了，形势任务变了，工作对象变了，思想政治工作的内容和方法也要随之改变，探索和总结新鲜经验，拓宽思想政治工作的路子。如果完全照搬思想政治工作原有的传统和经验，就不能适应今天的要求，就不可能具有旺盛的生命力。从这个意义上说，思想政治工作不改进，就没有出路，不创新，就缺乏活力，不改革，优良传统也不可能真正继承。因此，我们必须继续解放思想，坚持以马克思主义和党的基本路线为指导，遵循“尊重历史，立足现实，着眼未来”的方针，认真研究和探索新的历史条件下思想政治工作的特点和规律，不断创造新的形式和方法，使思想政治工作有一个大的发展。
