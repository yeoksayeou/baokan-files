Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Inspects Thai-Cambodian Border in Preparation for UN Team's Visit to Cambodia

BEIJING, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Bapho yesterday inspected the Thai-Cambodian border to prepare for the arrival of a United Nations investigation team in Cambodia.

In the Aranyaprathet district of Thailand's Prachinburi province, Bapho listened to a report on the border situation from the commander of the Thai Eastern Army and inspected a Cambodian refugee camp that had recently been shelled by Vietnamese forces.

According to reports, the UN investigation team will arrive in Bangkok on Aug. 6 and then enter Cambodia via the Aranyaprathet border crossing.

Bapho told reporters at the border yesterday that the UN investigation team would first meet with Thai officials upon their arrival in Bangkok. Thailand is prepared to provide assistance and convenience to the investigation team.

At the refugee camp, Bapho spoke with some Cambodian refugees. He said, "While all parties are working to resolve the Cambodian issue, the Vietnamese and Phnom Penh regime forces have shelled unarmed Cambodian refugees, which is regrettable." He warned the Vietnamese and Phnom Penh regime forces not to shell Thai territory again, otherwise, Thailand would respond with force.

    泰国副外长视察泰柬边境为联合国小组赴柬作准备
    本报曼谷8月4日电　记者刘爱成报道：泰国副外长巴博昨天视察泰柬边境，为联合国调查团赴柬作准备。
    在泰国巴真府亚兰地区，巴博副外长听取了泰国东方部队指挥官关于边境形势的汇报，并视察了不久前遭到越军炮击的8号柬埔寨难民营。
    据报道，联合国赴柬调查团将于本月6日抵达曼谷，然后由泰国亚兰地区边境进入柬埔寨。
    巴博副外长昨天在边境对记者说，联合国调查团到达曼谷后，将首先与泰国官员进行会晤，泰国准备为该调查团提供帮助和方便。
    在难民营里，巴博副外长同一些柬埔寨难民进行了交谈。他说：“在各方都在努力解决柬埔寨问题的时候，越军和金边政权军队炮击手无寸铁的柬埔寨难民，这是令人遗憾的”。他警告越军和金边政权军队不要再炮击泰国领土，否则，泰国方面将以武力进行还击。
