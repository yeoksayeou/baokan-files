Xu Jian, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and a secretary of the Party Central Committee, met today with a delegation from the Chinese Red Cross Society led by Qian Xinzhu. Xu Jian highly praised China's resolute action to quell the counter-revolutionary riots.

Xu Jian said, "Recently, China successfully quelled the counter-revolutionary riots, achieving national stability. Production and life have returned to normal. China's victory in quelling the riots is the result of the old revolutionary leaders, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core, adhering to the socialist path and the principles of the socialist revolution. China's action to quell the riots shows that socialist countries must uphold the socialist banner and strengthen party leadership to build socialism."

When discussing bilateral relations, Xu Jian said, "The friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the peoples of China and Korea has withstood the test of history. He hopes that the friendly relations between the two countries will continue to develop."

The delegation from the Chinese Red Cross Society arrived in Pyongyang on August 24 for a friendly visit. During the visit, the Chinese Red Cross Society delegation held talks with the Korean Red Cross Society.
