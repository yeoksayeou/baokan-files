This side, a three or four-year-old boy is joyfully jumping on a trampoline, while adults and children form a long queue beside it. They, although unable to jump as high as the athletes inside the hall or perform various daring and beautiful somersaults, are experiencing the thrill of trampolining for the first time.

A little further ahead, in the "Little Park," a small band from West Germany is playing and singing popular songs. The audience is either quietly enjoying the performance or dancing along; meanwhile, in the distance, the melodious sound of Scottish bagpipes can be heard, making one feel as if they were at a Scottish folk festival...

This is what the reporter witnessed in the "Sports Park" in front of the main venue of the Third World Games, the Karlsruhe European Hall. Standing here, one might not feel that they are at the center of the Third World Games, where thousands of athletes from nearly 60 countries and regions are competing for nearly 600 medals.

From July 20 to 30, the ancient city of Karlsruhe became a unique and refreshing venue for a comprehensive international sports "exhibition." The World Games, known as the "World Championships for non-Olympic sports," has, after an 8-year history, truly elevated and developed in Karlsruhe.

In addition to holding competitions for 21 official events, this World Games uniquely arranged 25 events for spectators to participate in, allowing them to experience the joy of being an "athlete" and learn about sports that were previously unfamiliar. Apart from that, the relevant authorities in Karlsruhe also organized 12 sports-related exhibitions and academic reports on topics such as the relationship between the World Games and the Olympics, sports and health, and sports and culture. Various concerts, films, and dramas further enriched the content of the World Games. The opening ceremony was personally presided over by the President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who referred to this Karlsruhe World Games, which integrates competitions, spectator participation, and corresponding cultural and entertainment programs and exhibitions, as the "Karlsruhe Model," particularly highlighting the innovative spectator participation events.

The World Games are increasingly gaining prominence in the international sports arena because they serve as a necessary supplement to the Olympics. They act like a special "bridge," giving lesser-known folk sports that cannot enter the mainstream the opportunity to go global and participate in international competitions. They facilitate communication between athletes from various countries, spectators, and especially between spectators and athletes. They blend the intensity of competitive sports with the relaxation of entertainment, infusing sports competitions with a sense of "human touch." This is a unique approach in the modern sports world, which increasingly emphasizes sports performance. Perhaps for this reason, it is increasingly welcomed by a broad audience who have experienced the intense competition of modern life.

    “卡尔斯鲁厄模式”
    ——第三届世运会印象记
    这边，一位三、四岁的小男孩在蹦床上欢快地跳跃着，大人和孩子在旁边排起了长队。他们，尽管不能像大厅内的运动员那样蹦得老高，且又做出各种惊险漂亮的翻滚动作，但却是第一次体会到了蹦床这一运动的“滋味”。
    再往前走，“小小公园”中一支西德的小乐队正在演奏和演唱流行歌曲。观众，有的在静静欣赏，有的随歌起舞；而远处，却又传来了苏格兰吹奏乐的悠扬乐曲，仿佛使人觉得，自己已身处苏格兰的民间庆典之中……
    这是记者在第三届世界运动会主要赛场卡尔斯鲁厄欧洲大厅前的“运动会公园”中的所见所闻。置身在这里，也许谁也不会感觉到，自己正处在第三届世界运动会的中心，在自己身边，来自近60个国家和地区的数千名运动员正在为近600枚奖牌进行着紧张的角逐。
    7月20日至30日，古城卡尔斯鲁厄成了一次别致而新鲜、丰富且生动的综合性国际体育“展览”的场所。被称为“非奥运会项目世界比赛”的世界运动会经过8年的短暂历史，在卡尔斯鲁厄得到了真正的提高和发展。
    本届世运会除了举行了21个正式项目的比赛之外，还别具一格地安排了25个观众亲自比试的项目，使观众能亲自体会“运动员”的乐趣，了解本来十分陌生的运动项目。除此之外，卡尔斯鲁厄有关机构还组织了12个与体育有关的展览和一些介绍世运会与奥运会关系、运动与健康、体育与文化等方面的学术报告。各种各样的音乐会和电影、戏剧更加丰富了世运会的内容。亲自主持开幕式的国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇称这一融竞技、观众亲自比试和相应文化与娱乐节目及展览为一体的卡尔斯鲁厄世运会为“卡尔斯鲁厄模式”，尤其是设观众比试项目这一独创。
    世运会在国际体坛的地位越来越高，因为它是奥运会的必要补充。它如同一座特殊的“桥”，使本不为人熟知、不能登大雅之堂的民间体育运动，获得了走向世界、参加国际大赛的机会；它沟通了各国运动员之间、观众与观众之间、特别是观众与运动员之间的心灵交流，它使紧张的竞技体育融汇了轻松的娱乐，使激烈的体育比赛充满了“人情味”。这在越来越过分地强调运动成绩的现代体坛，不能不说是独树一帜。也许正因如此，它越来越受到饱尝现代生活激烈竞争之苦的广大观众的欢迎。
