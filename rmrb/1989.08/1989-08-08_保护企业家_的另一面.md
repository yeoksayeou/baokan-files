Recently, in response to some incidents where factory directors and managers were harmed by workers, public opinion has strongly advocated for "protecting entrepreneurs." This call is completely necessary. However, the author has also noticed another situation: taking Wuhan as an example, since 1987, the city's labor arbitration committee has handled 58 cases where workers sued factory directors for unfair punishments. Of the 51 cases that have been concluded, workers won in 30 cases, both sides reached a stalemate in 6 cases, and workers lost in 15 cases, with a loss rate of only 29%. In the cases where workers won, the vast majority were due to factory directors abusing their power and arbitrarily punishing workers.

After implementing the factory director responsibility system, the vitality of enterprises has been released, but new puzzles have also emerged: the conflicts between managers and workers within enterprises have become prominent. The reasons for these conflicts, aside from some workers finding it difficult to adapt to new management and distribution methods, also include managers, after becoming the "commanders" and "judges" of enterprise production, distribution, and punishment, finding it difficult to fully adapt to their new roles.

It cannot be denied that most entrepreneurs can properly position themselves in relation to workers. However, there are indeed some factory directors and managers who place themselves in the position of "bosses" and view workers as "employees." This makes it difficult to avoid situations where "the individual calls the shots" or where power is abused, leading to arbitrary punishments of workers, causing some workers to suffer injustices, severely dampening workers' enthusiasm for labor, and even leading to incidents.

The author believes that, facing this situation, regulating the interests and interpersonal relationships between enterprise managers and workers is a major task in enterprise management. From the perspective of the management mechanism, deepening reforms is necessary to establish and improve the "enterprise community of interests." By tying managers and workers together with a "common rope," a new pattern of shared responsibility, shared interests, and mutual dependence can be formed. This can regulate the management behavior of factory directors and managers, and also inspire workers' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for the prosperity of the enterprise. From the perspective of entrepreneurs, it is important to establish the idea that workers are the masters of the enterprise and to advocate for a management approach centered on "love." It should be clear that enterprise reform has not changed the principal role of workers. The various rights of workers and managers within the enterprise are equal, and their management and supervision are bidirectional. Factory directors should not adopt a high-handed attitude to "press" workers; even when punishing workers, they should first do sufficient ideological work and avoid being simple and rough.

From the perspective of workers, they should model themselves on factory rules and regulations, accept management, and also understand, care for, and support factory directors and managers. The factory director responsibility system places factory directors at the forefront of various enterprise conflicts. In this situation, workers should understand the difficulties faced by factory directors, forgive their occasional mistakes, think more about their own responsibilities and obligations to the enterprise, actively help factory directors alleviate their burdens, and support their work. If there are grievances, they can be reported, but workers should not simply blame or resent factory directors, nor should they adopt a rigid and rough attitude to confront factory directors and managers.

In summary, in enterprise management, both the management rights of entrepreneurs and the legal rights of workers should be protected, and neither should be neglected.

    “保护企业家”的另一面
    刘章西
    前段时间，针对一些厂长、经理遭到职工伤害的情况，社会舆论曾大声疾呼要“保护企业家”。这呼吁完全是必要的。但笔者也了解到另一种情况：以武汉为例，1987年以来，该市劳动仲裁委员会受理工人告厂长处罚不公案58起。已结案的51起中，工人胜诉的30起，双方打“平手”的6起，工人败诉的15起，败诉率仅为29％。在工人胜诉的案例中，绝大部分是厂长以权代法，随意处罚所致。
    企业实行厂长负责制后，活力释放出来了，但同时也出现了新的困惑：企业内部经营者与劳动者的矛盾明显地突出了。造成矛盾突出的原因，除了有些劳动者一时还难以适应新的管理与分配方式以外，也有经营者在成为企业组织生产、实施分配、决定惩罚的“总指挥”、“主判官”等新的“角色”后，一时还难以完全胜任的问题。
    不可否认，大多数企业家是能够摆正自己与职工的位置的，但的确有一些厂长、经理，把自己摆到“老板”的地位上，把职工当作“雇员”看待。这就很难免凡事“个人说了算”，或以权代法，随心所欲，任意处罚工人，使一些工人蒙受委屈，严重挫伤了职工的劳动积极性，甚至酿出一些事端。
    笔者认为，面对这种状况，调节企业内部经营者与劳动者的利益关系和人际关系，是企业经营管理中的一件大事。从经营机制上说，要经过深化改革，建立和完善“企业利益共同体”。靠“共同体”把经营者与劳动者拴在“一条绳索”上，形成责任同担、利益共享、互为依赖的新格局，以此规范厂长、经理的管理行为，也激发广大职工对繁荣企业的责任感、积极性。从企业家方面讲，要树立起工人是企业的主人的观念，确立以“爱心”为内核的管理之道。应当明确，企业改革，工人的主人公地位并没有变。劳动者与经营者在企业中的各种权利是平等的，其管理与被管理、监督与被监督也是双向的。厂长不宜以居高临下的态势“压”职工；即使是处罚职工，也要先做好充分的思想工作，切忌简单粗暴。
    从职工方面讲，既要模范地遵守厂纪厂规，接受管理，也要理解、关心和爱护厂长、经理。厂长负责制使厂长大都处于企业各种矛盾的“风口浪尖”上，在这种情况下，职工应体谅厂长的难处，原谅他们的某些偶尔的失误，遇事多想想自己对企业的责任和义务，主动为厂长分忧解难，积极支持他们的工作。有意见可以反映，但不要一味责怪、怨恨厂长，更不能采取生硬、粗暴的态度和厂长、经理对着干。
    总之，在企业管理中，既要保护企业家行使管理权，又要保护工人的合法权益，两者不能偏废。
