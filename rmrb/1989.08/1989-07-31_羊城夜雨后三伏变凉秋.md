A night of rain has caused a sudden drop in temperature in Guangzhou, temporarily relieving residents from the intense heat. During the dog days, people are enjoying the refreshing coolness of autumn.

Starting from the night of the 27th, various regions in Guangdong were affected by a cold air trough from the north, turning a night of rain into an autumn-like cool weather. On the morning of the 29th, the temperature in Guangzhou dropped to 21.8 degrees Celsius. In the past forty years, such low temperatures in July have only occurred twice in Guangzhou. It is predicted that the low-temperature weather in Guangzhou will continue for another two to three days.
