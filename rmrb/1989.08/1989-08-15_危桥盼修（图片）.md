A dangerous bridge awaits repair! The arch is deformed, stones have fallen, and the piers are tilted, making it a frightening sight to behold.

Even more alarming is the scene of constant traffic: tractors rumble loudly, carts bustle with goods, people tread carefully like walking on thin ice, and bicycles weave through the crowd as usual.

If one were to ask: who will suffer if the bridge collapses one day? The disaster of this bridge is not far off. The local government must quickly come up with a good plan.

Chen Yu and Jing Fu took this photo at Shijia Bridge, 300 meters east of the city of Xinneng in Hunan Province.

    危桥盼修
    危乎，桥哉！拱圈变形，拱石坠落，桥墩倾斜，令人望而生畏。
    更可怕的是那车水马龙情景：拖拉机价天响，板车拉货忙，人行履薄冰，自行车穿梭如常。
    如果要问：一朝桥断谁遭殃！斯桥之祸，为时不远，当地政府快拿良策。
