Yan Mingfu, head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, today at the third enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National Congress of the China Democratic League, expressed the hope that the China Democratic League at all levels and its members will make full use of their close ties with the educational front, shoulder the heavy responsibility of cultivating a new generation of communists, and make due contributions to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

Yan Mingfu said that in recent years, we have neglected ideological and political work, especially on the educational front, we have relaxed our resistance to the bourgeois liberalization trend, resulting in our suffering the consequences in this turmoil from the student movement to the counter-revolutionary riot. The painful lesson tells us that on the educational front, we must clarify the direction of cultivation. Not only should we teach, but we must also educate people. The policy of cultivating "four-haves" new people must not be shaken.

Yan Mingfu pointed out that in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, the China Democratic League at all levels, like other democratic parties, has undergone tests. In the face of complex contradictions and difficult situations, they have done a lot of beneficial work to stabilize the situation. Now that the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot has achieved decisive victory, the China Democratic League is holding this Standing Committee meeting at this time, which is very necessary for distinguishing right from wrong, unifying understanding, and mobilizing all levels of organizations and members to complete the tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. I am deeply convinced that as the study deepens and the facts are understood, our understanding will become more and more consistent. I hope that everyone will make joint efforts, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and play an active role in implementing the line of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, completing the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, building socialism with Chinese characteristics, unifying the motherland, and revitalizing China.

    阎明复在民进中常会上说
    教育必须明确方向  不但教书更要育人
    新华社北京8月18日电　中共中央统战部部长、全国政协副主席阎明复今天在民进八届三次中常会扩大会议上希望，民进各级组织和广大成员发挥同教育战线有着密切联系的优势，共同肩负起培养共产主义一代新人的重任，为社会主义精神文明建设作出应有的贡献。
    阎明复说，近几年来，由于我们忽视了思想政治工作，特别是在教育战线放松了对资产阶级自由化思潮的抵制，致使我们在这次从学潮到动乱及至反革命暴乱中吃到了它的苦果。沉痛的教训告诉我们，在教育战线必须明确培养方向，不但要教书，更要育人，培养“四有”新人的方针绝不能动摇。
    阎明复指出，在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，民进各级组织和其他民主党派一样经受了考验，在矛盾复杂、处境困难的情况下，对稳定局势做了很多有益的工作。现在，制止动乱、平息暴乱的斗争已经取得了决定性胜利，民进在这个时候召开中常会，对于明辨是非，统一认识，动员各级组织和广大成员完成中共四中全会提出的任务，十分必要。我深信，随着学习的深入和对事实的了解，我们的认识会更加趋于一致。希望大家共同努力，坚持四项基本原则，为贯彻中共十三大路线，完成中共四中全会提出的各项任务，为建设四化，统一祖国，振兴中华，发挥积极作用。
