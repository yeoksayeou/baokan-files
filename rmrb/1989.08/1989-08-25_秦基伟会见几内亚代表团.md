Qin Jiyue Meets with Guinean Delegation

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 25 (Reporter Jiang Lurong) - State Councilor and Minister of Defense Qin Jiyue met with a friendly delegation from Guinea led by Mamadou Mankata Bangoura, Secretary-General of the National Rebirth Military Committee, this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People.

Qin Jiyue briefed the guests on the Chinese government's successful suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in early June. He said that some foreign governments and organizations have unjustly criticized China for suppressing the rebellion and have created a lot of propaganda. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. Qin Jiyue stated that the Chinese government and people will not yield to any external pressure and will not change China's policies due to this incident.

He also highly praised the comprehensive development of friendly cooperation between China and Guinea in various fields and reaffirmed China's stance on developing cooperative relations with Third World countries.

Bangoura expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and people for supporting Guinea's economic development and construction.

The delegation, invited by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, arrived in China on August 10 for a friendly visit. They have visited and toured Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Wuxi.

    秦基伟会见几内亚代表团
    新华社北京8月25日电　（记者姜鲁榕）国务委员兼国防部长秦基伟今天下午在人民大会堂会见由国家复兴军事委员会常务秘书处秘书长马马杜·芒卡塔·邦古拉率领的几内亚友好代表团。
    秦基伟向客人们介绍了中国政府在6月初胜利平息反革命暴乱的情况。他说，一些外国政府、组织对中国平息暴乱横加指责，大造舆论。这是粗暴干涉中国的内政。秦基伟说，中国政府和人民决不屈服于任何外来压力，也决不会由于这场风波而改变中国的政策。
    他还高度评价了中几两国在各个领域友好合作关系的全面发展，并重申中国坚持同第三世界国家发展合作关系的立场。
    邦古拉对中国政府和人民支持几内亚发展经济建设表示感谢。
    代表团应对外友协的邀请于8月10日来中国进行友好访问，已参观访问了北京、上海、南京、苏州、无锡等地。
