Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, August 29th.

The nationwide price inspection will commence in September, one month earlier than previous years. This information was obtained by reporters from the national price inspection work conference currently being held in Dalian.

In the first half of this year, various regions have diligently implemented the State Council's decision to strengthen price management and strictly control price increases. A series of measures have been taken to stabilize prices and control price increases, achieving notable results. However, factors that drive price increases in the second half of the year are still at work, making the task of achieving a significant reduction in the annual price increase rate compared to last year extremely arduous. Therefore, the State Price Bureau, based on the State Council's decision, will conduct a nationwide price inspection from September to December.

The focus of this year's price inspection includes: in addition to continuing to strengthen the inspection of prices for basic necessities and important charges, it will focus on inspecting the prices of coal, oil (including refined oil), cotton, chemical raw materials, negotiated grain and oil, timber, and other basic energy and raw materials, as well as transportation prices. For coal, the focus will be on inspecting issues such as intermediate price markups and reselling, profiteering, and illegal behaviors in the production link, such as converting planned coal to high-priced sales, substituting inferior goods for superior ones, adulterating, and shortchanging. For oil, the focus will be on inspecting non-compliance with state-set prices and maximum price limits, unauthorized expansion of price differentials, practices such as "one commodity, two tickets," selling at high prices under the guise of "swapping," using "activating" the economy as an excuse for "joint venture" rebates, and layer-by-layer purchasing and reselling, which lead to price increases or disguised price increases. For cotton, the focus will be on inspecting non-compliance with state-set procurement prices, supply prices, and quality standards, raising grades and prices, lowering grades and prices, adulterating, shortchanging, excessive charging, and various disguised methods of raising procurement and supply prices.

The methods of this year's price inspection have been improved, adopting a combination of forward and backward inspections, internal and external investigations, ticket and account verification with physical verification, and professional inspections with public reports. The inspections will primarily focus on industries, following the unified deployment of provincial price inspection bureaus, concentrating efforts, and coordinating between upper and lower levels to inspect one commodity, rectify one line, inspect one industry, and educate a large area. Inspections, handling, and collection will be done simultaneously.

The handling policy for this price inspection is more stringent. For major price-related illegal cases, in addition to economic penalties, coordination with disciplinary inspection departments and administrative supervision departments will be required. Those responsible for decision-making and direct responsibility will be given party disciplinary actions if necessary, administrative penalties if necessary, and those whose actions constitute crimes will be handed over to judicial authorities for criminal prosecution. At the same time, local authorities should pay special attention to investigating cases of government and departmental leaders overstepping their authority to adjust prices and interfere with inspections. Those who violate state regulations to raise prices or support price increases, as well as local and departmental leaders who interfere with the handling of cases, will be held accountable.

    全国物价大检查下月开始
    着重查煤炭石油棉花化工原料等和交通运价
    重大违法案决策人直接责任者将受严厉制裁
    新华社大连8月29日电  （记者李小林）今年全国物价大检查将于9月开始，比往年提前一个月。这是记者从正在大连召开的全国物价大检查工作会议上获悉的。
    今年上半年，各地认真贯彻国务院关于加强物价管理，严格控制物价上涨的决定，采取了一系列措施，使稳定物价、控制物价的工作取得成效。但是，推动下半年物价上涨的一些明显的或潜在的因素还在起作用，实现全年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年的任务仍然非常艰巨。为此，国家物价局根据国务院决定，将从9月至12月，在全国范围内进行物价大检查。
    今年物价大检查的重点是：除继续加强对基本生活必需品价格和重要收费的检查外，着重检查煤炭、石油（含成品油）、棉花、化工原料、议价粮油、木材等基础能源、原材料的价格和交通运价的检查。煤炭重点检查流通环节中间加价倒卖、重利盘剥问题和生产环节上存在的将计划内煤炭转计划外高价销售、以次充好、掺杂亏重等违法行为。石油主要检查不执行国家定价和最高限价、擅自扩大差率，搞一货两票、假借“串换”名义卖高价，以“搞活”经济为名，搞“联营”返利，以及层层套购倒卖等乱涨价或变相涨价行为。棉花主要检查不执行国家规定的收购价格、供应价格和质量标准，抬级抬价或压级压价、掺杂使假、亏重少秤、乱收费用以及以各种名义变相提高收购价格和供应价格。
    今年物价大检查的方法有所改进，采取顺查与逆查相结合、内查与外调相结合、票帐查对与实物验证相结合、专业检查与群众举报相结合的办法，以行业检查为主，按照省物价检查所的统一部署，集中力量、上下结合，做到检查一个品种，整顿一条线，检查一个行业教育一大片，边检查、边处理，边收缴入库。
    这次物价大检查的处理政策也更加严格，对重大价格违法案件，不但要给予经济制裁，还要与纪律检查部门和行政监察部门配合，对决策人和直接责任者该给党纪处分的给党纪处分，该给行政处分的给行政处分，情节严重构成犯罪的，要移交司法机关，追究刑事责任。同时，各地要特别注意查处少数政府及其部门负责人越权调价和干扰检查案件的“政府行为”，对那些违反国家规定乱涨价或支持涨价，以及干扰查处案件的地方和部门领导人，都要追究责任。
