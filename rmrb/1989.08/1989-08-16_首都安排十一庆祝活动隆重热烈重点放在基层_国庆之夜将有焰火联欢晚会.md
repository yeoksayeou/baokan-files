At a mobilization meeting held today in Beijing to strengthen spiritual civilization construction, welcome the National Day, and prepare for the Asian Games, State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong, pointed out: Currently, Beijing's central task is to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. We must arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad cadres and masses, enhance national self-confidence and pride, invigorate the spirit, achieve outstanding results, and welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

It is understood that this year's National Day will not have a military parade or mass march. Instead, the focus will be on organizing grassroots mass celebrations. On October 1st, several major parks in the capital will organize festive park activities, while other parks will be decorated according to festive requirements and open for free. At the same time, large sports venues will host sports performances, and theaters and cinemas will stage various programs.

A fireworks and gala evening will be held at Tiananmen Square, and fireworks will also be set off at other locations. Tiananmen Square will still be decorated with flower beds and other spectacular scenes, and will be open to the public in an organized manner.

Chen Xitong emphasized that we must celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation in a grand and enthusiastic manner. We must proudly proclaim the great achievements made under the leadership of the Communist Party of China by adhering to the socialist road on all fronts. We must raise everyone's awareness of adhering to the four cardinal principles, persisting in reform and opening up, and promoting socialist modernization.
