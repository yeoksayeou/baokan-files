A survey indicates that many schools and parents focus solely on the intellectual development of primary and secondary school students, neglecting or even rejecting labor education, leading children to develop in a lopsided manner, with "sharp minds but weak hands." For this reason, Liu Shifeng, deputy researcher at the Shandong Provincial Institute of Educational Sciences, appeals: "Do not cultivate talents who are clever but lazy."

Liu Shifeng, who has been engaged in labor and technical education research in primary and secondary schools for nearly a decade, recently discovered that only 1% to 5% of ordinary primary and secondary schools nationwide truly value labor education and do it well. Under the influence of "intellectual education first" and the one-sided pursuit of high admission rates, most schools do not prioritize labor education. Many schools lack textbooks, specialized teachers, facilities, and venues. Some schools issue textbooks but do not teach labor courses. Others, though having school-run factories, use them solely for revenue generation and do not organize students to work in the factories. Public benefit labor is even rarer.

In many families, especially those with only one child, parents love their children deeply and hope they will become successful. They do not let their children do any chores. A significant number of primary and secondary school students do not wash clothes, make their beds, or wash dishes. According to Liu Shifeng's survey of a key high school, among 112 senior high school students, only 25 had ever mended clothes or sewn on buttons. Statistics show that the average time Chinese youth spend on household chores is 0.2 hours per day, which is only 1/6 of that in the United States and 1/5 of that in Thailand.

Neglecting labor education has serious consequences, distorting many children's life goals, values, morals, and abilities. First, it weakens the labor ethic, making them unwilling to engage in physical labor. Second, it spreads a culture of laziness and entitlement, leading some to stray from the right path due to excessive material desires. Third, it leads to a lack of appreciation for labor achievements and public property. Fourth, it results in low practical skills and poor adaptability, creating "high-scoring but low-ability" individuals. Some graduates neither love labor nor know how to work, making it difficult for them to meet societal needs.

Liu Shifeng believes that labor is not only a powerful tool for ideological education but also an indispensable part of basic education, crucial for cultivating well-rounded talents. Labor education is as important as moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic education and should be clearly reflected in our educational policies. He suggests that we should quickly change the current trend of neglecting labor education while avoiding the mistakes of the late 1950s and the Cultural Revolution, where labor was used as a substitute for education and the "labor punishment theory" resurfaced. Instead, we should gradually bring labor education onto a scientific track. Additionally, we should imbue it with contemporary characteristics, combining labor education with technical education to comprehensively cultivate students' labor values, habits, and skills.

    学校和家长重智轻劳引起专家忧虑
    中小学应加强劳动教育
    切莫培养头脑精明四体不勤的人才
    据新华社济南8月14日电（记者郭修生）一项调查表明，许多学校和家长只注重中小学生的智力开发，忽视甚至排斥劳动教育，导致孩子朝着“头脑发达、双手退化”的方向畸形发展。为此，山东省教育科学研究所副研究员刘世峰呼吁：“切莫培养头脑精明、四体不勤的人才。”
    近十年来一直从事中小学劳动技术教育研究的刘世峰，最近调查发现，全国各地的普通中小学真正重视劳动教育并且搞得好的只占1％至5％。在“智育第一”和片面追求升学率的影响下，大多数学校没有把劳动教育摆到应有位置。很多学校一无教材，二无专职教师，三无场地和设施。只发教材，不上劳动课。或者虽有校办工厂，但仅为创收，并不组织学生到厂劳动。社会公益劳动，更是少得可怜。
    在很多家庭，特别是独生子女家庭，父母爱子情深，望子成“龙”心切，什么活都不让孩子干。相当多的中小学生不洗衣服，不叠被子，不洗碗筷。据刘世峰对一所重点中学调查，112名高中三年级女生中，缝补过衣服、钉过钮扣的仅有25人次。资料表明，全国青少年学生人均每天参加家务劳动0.2小时，仅为美国的1／6，泰国的1／5。
    忽视劳动教育，带来了严重危害，使很多孩子的人生目标、价值观念、道德情操、能力素质等发生扭曲。一是劳动观念淡薄，不愿当体力劳动者。二是好逸恶劳、坐享其成的习气蔓延，有的因物欲膨胀走上歧途。三是不珍惜劳动成果，不爱护公共财物。四是动手能力低，适应性不强，成了“高分低能”的畸形人。一些学生毕业后既不爱劳动，又不会劳动，很难适应社会的需要。
    刘世峰认为，劳动不仅是一种强有力的思想教育手段，而且是基础教育的不可缺少的组成部分，对培养全面发展的人才至关重要。劳动教育与德智体美教育同等重要，在我们的教育方针中应该明确体现。他提出，既要尽快改变目前忽视劳动教育的倾向，又要防止出现五十年代末和“文革”期间以劳代教的偏差和“劳动惩罚论”抬头，逐步把劳动教育纳入科学化轨道。同时要赋予时代特点，把劳动教育与技术教育结合起来，使学生在劳动观念、劳动习惯、劳动技能等方面得到全面培养。
