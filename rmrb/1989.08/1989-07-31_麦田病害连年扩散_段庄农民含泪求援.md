Edition: 6

Since 1984, the wheat fields in the northern part of our village have frequently suffered from diseases. Initially, the wheat seedlings would wither and stop growing. Then, the roots and stems would gradually turn yellow and wither. Most of the wheat would dry up before even forming ears. This unidentified disease spreads rapidly. In just a few years, the affected wheat fields in our village have expanded from forty to fifty mu to over a thousand mu, and the disease has even spread to neighboring villages.

Local relevant departments have come to our village multiple times to test the soil and water sources and to inspect the seeds, but they have been unable to determine the cause of the disease. Many of our fellow villagers are in tears, hoping that relevant research institutions can provide an effective "prescription" to eradicate this disease.

    麦田病害连年扩散　段庄农民含泪求援
    1984年以来，俺村北地种植的小麦经常发生病害，起初麦苗萎缩不长，继而根茎逐渐枯黄，大部分未吐穗就干枯死了。这种叫不出名堂的病害蔓延很快，短短几年，我村有这种病害的小麦由四五十亩发展到上千亩，并扩散到邻村。
    当地有关部门曾多次来俺村化验土壤、水源，检验种子，但找不出病因。俺村不少乡亲泪流满面，希望有关科研单位给俺开个顶用的“处方”，根治这种病害。
