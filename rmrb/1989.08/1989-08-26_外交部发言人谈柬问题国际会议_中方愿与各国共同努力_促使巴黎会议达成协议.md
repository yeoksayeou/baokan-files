At a press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a reporter asked: Will Foreign Minister Qian attend the ministerial-level meeting of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia as scheduled?

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied: The Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which has attracted global attention, has been underway for nearly a month. The Chinese side, together with the majority of participating countries, has made active efforts to ensure the success of the conference. However, due to the inflexible attitudes of Vietnam and the Phnom Penh authorities, the conference has yet to reach an agreement. The Chinese side is still willing to make every effort together with all participating countries. If the four committees of the conference can reach agreements, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will go to Paris to attend the meeting. Before that, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Shuxian will be authorized to attend the ministerial-level meeting.

    中方愿与各国共同努力  促使巴黎会议达成协议
    本报北京8月26日讯　在外交部新闻发布会上，有记者问：钱外长是否如期去巴黎参加柬埔寨国际会议的部长级会议？
    我外交部发言人回答说：举世瞩目的柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议已经举行了近一个月。中国方面同与会大多数国家一起，为使会议取得成功作出了积极努力。但由于越南和金边当局态度僵硬，致使会议至今难以达成协议。中方仍愿意同与会各国一起继续作出最大的努力。如会议的四个委员会都能达成协议，钱其琛外长将前往巴黎与会，此前将委托刘述卿副外长出席部长级会议。
