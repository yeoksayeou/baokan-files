Currently, entities with the right to export traditional Chinese medicine include not only the departments of traditional Chinese medicine and foreign trade, but also systems such as agriculture, commerce, light industry, chemical industry, the military, and organizations like the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, China International Trust and Investment Corporation, and Kanghua Company. These entities, which have no relation to traditional Chinese medicine, are now involved in cross-industry operations to export traditional Chinese medicine. They neither take responsibility for the overall planning of the domestic and international markets for traditional Chinese medicine nor understand the domestic resources of traditional Chinese medicine. For some scarce domestic and international varieties, they raise prices to purchase and sell at low prices abroad, creating a situation where "we are fighting each other." Ultimately, the export volume increases, but foreign exchange earnings decrease.

In recent years, this chaotic situation has caused significant losses to China's foreign exchange earnings from traditional Chinese medicine. To compete for the purchase of medicinal materials, there have been "Licorice Wars," "Pseudobulbus Cremastrae Seu Pleiones War," and "Evodia Fruit Wars" in the domestic market, leading to severe damage to traditional Chinese medicine resources. For example, licorice has a large domestic demand and is known as "ten parts licorice." The state regulates the annual export of 3,700 tons, but the actual export exceeds 10,000 tons, reducing China's licorice resources by 70%.

Multiple Exporters, Disorganized Efforts

Jilin Province is famous for its ginseng, with its ginseng export products accounting for 70% of the total international market transactions. However, the price is only 30% of that in South Korea. This is because our ginseng exports are individually operated, like "a scattered mess." In contrast, South Korea has unified management. All exported ginseng is marketed under the name "Korean Ginseng." We, on the other hand, have various names such as Jilin Red Ginseng, Changbai Mountain Red Ginseng, Xinhe River Ginseng, Liaohe Ginseng, and Huangfeng Ginseng, despite their superior quality, but the processing and packaging cannot compete with South Korea.

In fact, in the international market, it is not just ginseng that suffers losses. Due to domestic competition in exports, famous brand products are produced by multiple companies, with numerous names, and some are even counterfeit, severely damaging their reputation.

### 我国中药出口管理混乱

    我国中药出口管理混乱
    肥水流入外人田　目前，具有中药出口权的不仅有中药、外贸部门，还有农垦、商业、轻纺、化工、部队等十几个系统以及工商联、中信公司、康华公司等单位。它们本与中药业务毫无关系，现在来跨行业插手经营中药出口，既不负责国内外中药市场的统筹安排，又不了解国内中药资源情况。对一些国内外紧缺品种，它们抬价抢购，低价外销，造成国人“自相残杀”的局面。最终是出口数量增加，创汇反而减少。
    近几年，这种混乱局面给我国中药外汇收入带来很大损失。为争购药材，国内曾出现了“甘草大战”、“田七大战”、
  “吴萸大战”，致使中药资源遭到严重破坏。如甘草，国内用量很大，有“十方九草”之称。国家规定每年出口3700吨，实际出口却在1万吨以上，使我国的甘草资源减少了70％。
    多头出口一盘散沙　吉林省盛产人参，其人参出口产品占国际市场交易总量的70％，但价格仅及南朝鲜的30％。这是因为我们的人参出口是各自经营，“一盘散沙”。而南朝鲜却是统一管理。出口的人参一律以“高丽参”名称对外。我们则有吉林红参、长白山红参、新开河参、辽河参、皇封参等多种名目，尽管质量上乘，但加工、包装难与南朝鲜匹敌。
    其实，在国际上吃亏的又何止人参一种呢？中成药由于国内竞相出口，名牌产品多家生产，名目繁多，有的甚至鱼目混珠，名誉大大受损。
