People often refer to Thailand as the "Land of Smiles" and the "Land of Etiquette," and this is not an exaggeration. In Thailand, hotel, restaurant, and shop staff are always courteous and smiling. Other public places and streets are also orderly, with people treating each other with respect. If you ask for directions on the street, you will receive a warm and patient response, and sometimes they will even accompany you to your destination. I asked my Thai friends how this custom came about. They said, "Thai people are taught by their parents from a young age and then receive specialized education at school, allowing good traditions to be passed down from generation to generation."

Recently, we visited a combined middle and elementary school in Bangkok. As soon as we entered the school gate, a group of female students approaching us first smiled, then pressed their palms together in a traditional Thai greeting, bowed their heads, and then quietly walked past us. The education department official accompanying us explained, "This is our traditional Thai etiquette."

In the reception room, the principal and the vice-principal emphasized the school's efforts in civilized etiquette education.

The school has won the first prize in civilized etiquette education in Bangkok three times.

The school has a special committee and dedicated teachers for civilized etiquette education. Every morning before cultural classes, there is a half-hour session dedicated to civilized etiquette education. The educational content covers three aspects:

Patriotic education. The school holds flag-raising ceremonies and sings the national anthem; teaches Thai excellent traditions; learns about patriotic figures; and organizes students to visit border defense troops.

Moral education. The school educates students to be honest and diligent. In addition to classroom education, the school often organizes students to visit poor areas, making them aware that there are still poor people in the country, encouraging them to study hard, and cultivating their sympathy and understanding. Students voluntarily raise funds for various charitable activities, visit nursing homes, or support poor students. The students also organize a "self-help group" where classmates help each other solve problems and use their spare time to collect recyclables, turning waste into treasure. The school regularly organizes students to participate in volunteer labor, such as cleaning public places or helping to direct traffic on the streets, cultivating their love for labor and respect for public order.

Etiquette and appearance education. The school requires students to dress neatly, behave elegantly, respect teachers, and speak politely. The school also uses activities like "Mother's Day" and "Teacher's Day" to cultivate students' respect for teachers.

In terms of civilized etiquette education, the school regularly holds evaluation and commendation activities to promote the continuous progress of this education.

At the end of the visit, the education department official told us that civilized etiquette education is conducted under the unified regulations of the education department, from primary school to university, without interruption.

    泰国学校的文明礼貌教育
    本报记者 　刘爱成
    人们称泰国为“微笑国度”、“礼仪之邦”，这并非夸张。在泰国，旅馆、饭店、商店的服务员总是彬彬有礼，笑容可掬，其它公共场所或街上也是秩序井然，人们以礼相待。如果在大街上问路，你会得到热情耐心的指点，有时会把你一直送到目的地。我问泰国朋友这种风尚是怎样形成的。他们说，“泰国人从小在家受到父母的言传身教，上学后又接受专门的教育，使优良传统得以代代相传”。
    不久前，我们访问了曼谷市一所中、小学合校。一进校门，一队迎面走来的女学生先是向我们微笑，随即双手合十低头向我们行礼，然后略弯一下腰，悄悄地从我们身边走过。陪同我们的教育部官员解释说，“这就是我们泰国传统的礼节。”
    在会客室里，校长及教导主任向我们着重介绍了他们抓文明礼貌教育的情况。
    该校在文明礼貌教育方面曾三次荣获曼谷市一等奖。
    学校有专管文明礼貌教育的特别委员会和专职教师，每天早晨上文化课之前，有半小时的文明礼貌课。教育内容有三个方面：
    爱国主义教育。举行升国旗仪式、唱国歌；讲解泰国优良传统；学习爱国人士事迹；组织学生慰问边防部队等。
    品德教育。教育学生为人诚实，做事扎实。学校除了课堂教育外，还经常组织学生到贫民区去访贫问苦，使他们知道国内还有穷人，激励他们努力学习，同时也培养他们不嫌弃贫穷，增强同情心。学生们自觉地为各种慈善活动集资筹款，或慰问养老院，资助贫困学生。学生中还组织有“自助会”，同学们互相帮助，解决困难，并利用课余时间收集废品，变废为宝。学校定期组织学生参加义务劳动，如打扫公共场所卫生，或组织他们到街上协助指挥交通，培养他们热爱劳动和遵守公共秩序的习惯。
    礼貌仪表教育。学校要求学生穿着整洁，举止文雅，尊敬师长，说话和气，并且利用“母亲节”、“教师节”等活动，培养他们尊敬师长的品质。
    在文明礼貌教育上，学校定期举行评比表彰活动，以推动这一教育的持续进行。
    访问结束时，教育部官员对我们说，文明礼貌教育是在教育部统一规定下开设的，从小学一直抓到大学，从不间断。
