How can agriculture, especially grain production, break through the stagnation? Based on the practices of many places in Henan Province in the past two years, I believe that on the basis of stabilizing family farming, implementing the dual-direction contract responsibility system in agriculture may become a new path for promoting the continuous and stable development of agriculture.

The so-called dual-direction contract responsibility system is to clarify the target responsibilities layer by layer between counties, townships, villages, and households regarding various agricultural production projects. Contracts are signed, and agricultural production materials and technical, financial services are contracted from top to bottom. From bottom to top, the completion of agricultural output, procurement tasks, and other economic indicators is contracted, and a reward and punishment system is established to ensure timely fulfillment.

As one of the main grain-producing areas in China, Henan Province saw a stagnation in grain production from 1984 to 1988, with an average annual decrease of 1.7%. Why did this situation occur after a period of continuous high-speed growth? The reasons are multifaceted. However, the imperfection of the household contract responsibility system and the failure of accompanying reform measures to keep up are significant factors. This is reflected in agricultural production in the following ways: First, after farmers became independent producers, they urgently needed socialized services. However, due to the imperfect service system, agricultural materials were in short supply and high in price, and the cooperative economic organizations in rural areas had limited capacity, making it difficult to meet the needs of production development. Additionally, the comparative benefits of grain production decreased, leading many farmers to adopt an attitude of "as long as there is enough to eat." Second, after the state implemented the contract procurement system for grain, many township and village cadres only emphasized the completion of collective levies and state procurement tasks by farmers, without setting appropriate increase targets and requirements for land protection and soil improvement. This resulted in "contract responsibility without production responsibility," and the government's plans and decisions could not be coordinated with the decentralized operations of thousands of households. These problems directly affected the development of agricultural production.

The implementation of the dual-direction contract responsibility system can effectively change this situation.

Firstly, it is beneficial for the relatively complete and stable combination of various factors of agricultural production, accelerating the modernization of agriculture. The household contract responsibility system realized the combination of labor force and land, two basic factors of production. However, under modern agricultural conditions, this is still an incomplete combination. Only by integrating scientific and technological, agricultural production materials, and financial factors can a complete modern agricultural productive force be formed. The dual-direction contract responsibility system assigns the responsibility of providing agricultural materials and technical guidance to counties, townships, and villages through contracts, ensuring the supply of materials and the promotion of scientific and technological progress, and removing the farmers' worries.

Secondly, it is beneficial for the normalization of dual-layer management, improving the degree of socialized services. The household contract responsibility system is a dual-layer management system that combines unified and decentralized operations within the cooperative economy of townships and villages. However, in many places, unified management is merely formalistic, and dual-layer management is actually single-layer management. The main reason is that township and village cooperative economic organizations lack the ability to coordinate production factors other than land; their services to households lack a binding mechanism, making it indifferent whether the services are good or bad. The implementation of the dual-direction contract responsibility system, as the government is the primary party to sign the contract, can instruct technological units, material supply, and agricultural administrative departments to work together, forming a "technology, materials, and politics" three-in-one service team. Each team completes the service projects contracted by the government, forming a situation where the whole society serves agriculture. This makes the services that township and village cooperative economic organizations, including the government, should provide contractually binding, and whoever breaches the contract is punished, thus turning services into real actions.

Thirdly, it is beneficial for achieving scale management of agricultural production in larger links. The dual-direction contract responsibility system does not change the current land contract relationship. It is based on family farming, integrating the service functions of various levels and departments and various service organizations, closely surrounding the realization of the annual agricultural output target, providing unified services, and forming scale management of agricultural production in larger links. In places in our province where the dual-direction contract responsibility system is well-implemented, some have already achieved unified planting plans at the township level, unified procurement and supply of agricultural production materials, unified seed allocation, and unified distribution of irrigation oil; at the village level, unified mechanical cultivation, unified crop pattern cultivation, unified water management and use, and unified pest control.

Fourthly, it is beneficial for government departments to transform their functions, strengthening the government's macro-control and management of agriculture. For a long time, various levels of government have been accustomed to using administrative means to command agricultural production. The dual-direction contract responsibility system combines administrative and economic means, transforming the government's leadership of agriculture from the traditional administrative command type to the service guidance type, promoting the reform of government departments themselves. At the same time, the implementation of the dual-direction contract responsibility system allows local governments to formulate unified agricultural production plans based on national needs and market guidance, local economic strength, and service levels. They can use contractual relationships to guide farmers to accept planned guidance and complete state agricultural product procurement tasks on time and in quantity. This can ensure that the government's plans and decisions are implemented in thousands of households, creating conditions for establishing and improving the agricultural product market system.

Fifthly, it is beneficial for improving grassroots work and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. Currently, there is a widespread problem of tense relationships between cadres and the masses in rural areas, mainly due to the widespread existence of contradictions between "giving" and "taking" and the dispersion of grassroots organizations. By fulfilling responsibilities at all levels and treating each other equally, the relationship between cadres and the masses becomes harmonious and friendly.

Practice has shown that the dual-direction contract responsibility system indeed perfects and develops the household contract responsibility system, and is a beneficial exploration of deepening rural reforms. It is suitable for the current level of agricultural productive forces and the level of cadre management, enhancing the vitality and potential of agriculture. Many places have also extended the dual-direction contract responsibility system from planting to the service system construction of forestry, animal husbandry, and township enterprises, achieving remarkable results.

The dual-direction contract responsibility system in agriculture is a new thing and is still in the exploratory stage, requiring further improvement and enhancement. Currently, the implementation of this method is objectively constrained by the supply and demand contradiction of agricultural production materials. When various levels determine service projects, they should be based on actual possibilities to prevent blind promises.

    农村实行联产承包责任制后，与其配套的改革措施如何跟上？河南省通过深化改革作出了尝试——
    双向承包推进农业发展
    宋照肃
    农业，特别是粮食生产怎样突破徘徊？根据河南省近两年许多地方的实践，我认为，在稳定家庭经营的基础上，实行农业双向承包责任制，有可能成为推进农业持续稳定发展的一条新路。
    所谓双向承包责任制，就是围绕农业生产的各个项目，在县、乡、村、户之间，层层明确目标责任，签订合同，自上而下承包农业生产资料供应和技术、资金服务，自下而上承包农业产量、定购任务和其他经济指标的完成，并制定奖惩制度，按时兑现。
    作为我国粮食主产区之一的河南省，1984年至1988年，粮食生产也出现了徘徊，年均下降1.7％。为什么在连续高速增长之后，会出现这种局面？原因是多方面的。而家庭联产承包制不完善，与其相配套的改革措施没有跟上，是重要的一条。这反映到农业生产上，一是农户成为独立的生产经营者之后，迫切需要社会化服务，但由于服务体系不健全，农用物资量缺价高，乡村合作经济组织的能量有限，实际的服务远不能满足生产发展的要求。加之种粮比较效益下降，许多农民产生了“够吃拉倒”的情绪。二是国家对粮食实行合同定购制以后，许多乡、村干部只强调农民完成集体提留和国家定购任务，没有再明确提出合适的增产指标，以及保护土地、培肥地力等要求，造成“联产承包不联产，责任田里无责任”，政府的计划、决策与千家万户的分散经营协调不起来。这些问题，都直接影响了农业生产的发展。
    而实行双向承包，可以有效地改变这种局面。
    首先，有利于农业生产诸要素较为完整和稳定地结合，加快农业现代化进程。家庭联产承包制实现了劳动力和土地这两个基本生产要素的结合，但是在现代农业条件下，这还是一种不完整的结合，只有把包括科学技术、农业生产资料及资金在内的生产要素一起结合进去，才能形成完整的现代农业生产力。双向承包把为农民提供农用物资、技术指导的责任，以合同的形式，确定由县、乡、村为一方来承担，保证了物资供应和科学技术的推广，解除了农户的后顾之忧。
    其次，有利于双层经营趋于规范化，提高社会化服务程度。家庭联产承包制是乡、村合作经济内部实行统一经营和分散经营相结合的双层经营制。但是，现在许多地方统一经营流于形式，双层经营实际上是单层经营。其主要原因是，乡、村合作经济组织缺乏协调除土地以外的生产要素的能力；对其为农户的服务缺乏约束机制，搞好搞坏无所谓。实行双向承包，由于是由政府为首要一方签订承包合同，它可以指令科技单位、物资供应和农业行政部门通力合作，组成“技、物、政”三位一体的服务集团，分别去完成政府所承包的服务项目，形成全社会为农业服务，这就使乡、村合作经济组织包括政府应提供的服务由合同约束下来，谁毁约就处罚谁，从而能把服务变成了实实在在的行动。
    第三，有利于实现农业生产在较大环节上的规模经营。双向承包并不改变目前土地承包关系，它是在家庭经营的基础上，把各级各部门和各类服务组织的服务功能凝聚起来，紧紧围绕实现当年农业产量指标，统一服务，使农业生产在较大环节上形成了规模经营。在我省双向承包搞得好的地方，有的已实现了以乡为单位统一种植计划，统一购供农业生产资料，统一调剂种子，统一分配灌溉用油；以村为单位统一使用机械耕作，统一作物模式栽培，统一管水用水，统一防治病虫害。
    第四，有利于政府部门转变职能，加强政府对农业的宏观调控和管理。长期以来，各级政府习惯于用行政手段指挥农业生产。双向承包将行政手段和经济手段结合起来，政府领导农业的方式从传统的行政指挥型变为服务指导型，推动了政府部门自身的改革。同时，实行双向承包，地方政府还可以根据国家需要和市场导向，根据当地的经济实力和服务程度，统一制定农业生产计划，并利用合同关系使农户接受计划指导，按时按量完成国家农产品定购任务，这就可以使政府的计划、决策在千家万户得到落实，为建立健全农产品市场体系创造条件。
    第五，有利于改进基层工作，密切干群关系。现在农村普遍存在着干群关系紧张的问题，这主要因为农村普遍存在着“予”与“取”的矛盾和基层组织涣散的问题。上下各尽其责，平等相处，干群关系变得和谐融洽。
    实践表明，双向承包确实完善和发展了家庭联产承包制，是深化农村改革的有益探索。它适合当前农业生产力发展水平和干部管理水平，增强了农业的活力和后劲。还有不少地方把双向承包从种植业引向林果业、畜牧业、乡镇企业的服务体系建设上，也取得了明显的效果。
    农业双向承包责任制是个新事物，还处在探索阶段，需要进一步完善和提高。目前实行这个办法，在客观上受到农业生产资料供求矛盾的制约。各级确定服务项目时，应该根据实际可能，防止盲目许愿。
