Last year until just before this year's National Day, Heilongjiang Province had 8 large-scale thermal power generating units put into operation, with a total installed capacity of 107.5 million kilowatts. The scale and speed of construction rank among the top in the country.

After 40 years of construction, Heilongjiang Province has become an important energy base for the country. In addition to providing the country with a large amount of petroleum resources and products, it produces over 70 million tons of coal annually and provides 24 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is tens to hundreds of times more than at the beginning of liberation.

On the eve of liberation, Heilongjiang's coal production was only 4.6 million tons, with an installed power generation capacity of 171,000 kilowatts, and petroleum production was non-existent. After liberation, the state designated Heilongjiang as one of the key regions for development and construction, investing a large amount of funds in the development of coal and electricity production, and began the development and construction of the Daqing Oil Field in the late 1950s.

Over the past 40 years, Heilongjiang Province has adopted the policy of "walking on two legs" and promoting the development of large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously. While focusing on the development of state-owned coal mines, it has actively promoted the development of local coal mines. The state has focused on developing and constructing the four major coal bases of Jixi, Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Qitaihe, increasing coal mining capacity by 45.2 million tons. The annual production of local coal mines has reached 20 million tons.

Heilongjiang's abundant coal resources have provided a prerequisite for the development of electricity production. Since liberation, with state investment as the main source, funds from various channels have been raised to build 15 large and medium-sized thermal power plants, increasing power generation capacity by over 4 million kilowatts, accounting for 80% of the province's new capacity. In 1988, the province's total power generation reached 24.68 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 116 times over the initial period of the nation's founding.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Heilongjiang's electricity development entered a "golden age." From 1981 to 1985, the investment in electricity development and construction reached 1.31 billion yuan, and from 1986 to 1988, it reached 2.2 billion yuan. This year, the province has 9 electricity construction projects with a total investment of 880 million yuan.

    黑龙江建成重要能源基地
    1988年全省发电量比建国初期增加116倍
    本报讯　去年至今年国庆节前夕，黑龙江省共有8台大型火力发电机组先后投入运行，总装机容量达到107.5万千瓦，建设规模和速度在全国名列前茅。
    经过40年建设，黑龙江省已成为国家重要的能源基地。除为国家提供大量的石油资源和产品外，每年还为国家生产煤炭7000多万吨，提供电力240多亿千瓦时，是解放初期的几十倍、上百倍。
    解放前夕，黑龙江的煤炭产量只有460万吨，发电装机容量17.1万千瓦，石油生产是项空白。解放后，国家把黑龙江作为重点开发建设的地区之一，拿出大量资金发展煤炭、电力生产，并从50年代末开始开发建设大庆油田。
    40年来，黑龙江省煤炭工业建设采取“两条腿走路”和大中小并举的方针，在重点发展国家统配煤矿的同时，积极发展地方煤矿。国家重点开发建设了鸡西、鹤岗、双鸭山和七台河四大煤炭基地，新增煤炭开采能力4520万吨。地方煤矿的年产量已达到2000万吨。
    黑龙江丰富的煤炭资源为发展电力生产提供了先决条件。解放后，以国家投资为主，多方集资兴建了15个大中型火电厂，新增发电能力400多万千瓦，占全省新增能力的80％。1988年全省发电量达到246.8亿千瓦时，比建国初期增加了116倍。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，黑龙江电力发展步入“黄金时代”。1981年至1985年间，用于电力开发和发展的投资达到13.1亿元，1986年到1988年达到22亿元。今年，全省电力建设项目共有9个，总投资额8.8亿元。
