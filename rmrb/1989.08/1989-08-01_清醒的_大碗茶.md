The Sober "Big Bowl Tea"

During the days when Beijing was plagued by student protests, turmoil, and riots, the more than 1,000 employees of the Beijing Big Bowl Tea Commercial Group Company consciously distinguished right from wrong and good from evil, and with their practical actions, sang a "three-part song" that is worthy of admiration.

		"Not to Receive"

Since ancient times, teahouses have been places where information is exchanged and people gather.

The "Old She Tea House," which belongs to "Big Bowl Tea," is located in the bustling area of Qianmen. Beijing Labor Model and recipient of the National May 1st Labor Medal, Yin Shengxi, is the "head manager" here.

However, before the student protests, the Old She Tea House, which combines tea drinking, reminiscing, and conversation, also faced a political choice.

On the morning of March 18, two young men and women came to the office of the general manager of the company at 66 Xizhumen, claiming to be from the "Chinese Institute of Science and Technology Research Institute." They said they were planning to hold a "Chinese Celebrity Lecture Series" in April and invited the company's general manager, Yin Shengxi, to participate, suggesting that the venue be the Old She Tea House. The company's staff, noting that the general manager was not present, did not give a definite answer.

On March 22, Yin Shengxi met with the six people, including the two from the previous visit, in the "Longjing" private room of the tea house. Two of them were over 50 years old. They mentioned that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, and the central government did not plan to hold any major events, only small-scale discussions and lectures. They believed that holding the event at the Old She Tea House would be ideal. They planned to hold 10 lectures, with each lecture to be hosted by General Manager Yin.

After listening to their explanation, Yin Shengxi asked who would be giving the lectures. The other party quickly handed over a typed and photocopied list, with the first name being "Fang Lizhi." Yin Shengxi immediately felt something was amiss and stood up to leave. After that, the other party called multiple times, expressing that "even one lecture would be fine." Yin Shengxi and the other comrades at "Big Bowl Tea" unanimously replied, "Not to receive."

It is understood that since the Old She Tea House opened more than three months ago, it has served over 28,000 domestic and foreign customers, with more than 100 social organizations holding various cultural exchange activities. Only the "Chinese Celebrity Lecture Series" was rejected.

Later, Yin Shengxi told the reporter: "The purpose of our Old She Tea House is to 'revitalize the national tea culture and support national arts.' For activities held here, there must be a precondition, which is to firmly uphold the four cardinal principles. If we agree to let them hold the lecture here, 'Big Bowl Tea' might become the 'Xidan Democracy Wall.'"

		"Not to Allow Protests"

Qianmen and Tiananmen Square are only separated by one square. Events happening in the square could not help but affect "Big Bowl Tea."

At the start of the protests, the party committee of "Big Bowl Tea" promptly convened a meeting of party members and managers, clearly stating that "employees are not allowed to leave their posts without permission." The party branch held multiple meetings, reminding employees to "listen to the government, we cannot go protest."

To help employees understand the spirit of the central government, they set up two loudspeakers at the entrance of "Big Bowl Tea" to broadcast Premier Li Peng's speech at the meeting of the capital's party, government, and military cadres, and to explain the "April 26" editorial of the People's Daily.

To prevent the situation from escalating, they cooperated with the public security department to organize a "factory security team" of over 100 employees, preparing sticks and fire-fighting materials to be ready in case of looting by thugs.

By mid-May, the protesting crowds filled the Qianmen market, and some employees began to waver. Some said, since people from the intellectual, news, and even the State Council offices are protesting, why can't we?

When these issues arose, Yin Shengxi did not overly blame the employees but patiently and meticulously persuaded and educated them, and established rules in each department: "If anyone goes to protest, they will be expelled."

On May 19, rumors spread on the streets that "someone from Big Bowl Tea" had gone to protest with banners. Yin Shengxi immediately sent people with cameras to search, but found none.

On June 3, Yin Shengxi had people hang a large vertical banner in the Qianmen market of "Big Bowl Tea" that read, "Firmly call for the removal of the 'God of Democracy' from Tiananmen Square" and "Firmly oppose the turmoil." The secretary of the Propaganda Department of Xuanwu District, Li Ying, tightly held Yin Shengxi's hand and said, "Old Yin, you've done well!"

On the morning of June 3, five or six people came to the Big Bowl Tea Decoration Company in a threatening manner, demanding to see Yin Shengxi. The on-duty employee, Liu Yuzhen, told them that Old Yin was not there. This group shouted, "Isn't he supporting Li Peng? Let him go support there." After saying this, they patted their knives at their waists and left. That night, a group of thugs burned the large banner on the market.

Under Yin Shengxi's leadership, "Big Bowl Tea" had no one participate in the protests, support, or cause trouble.

		"Supply Everything"

On May 20, Premier Li Peng issued the martial law order, but the troops entering the city were obstructed.

On May 30, Yin Shengxi led part of the "Big Bowl Tea" employees to the Liu Li Bridge area to visit the obstructed soldiers.

On the night of June 3, the front of the "Big Bowl Tea" affiliated market was noisy. Manager Wang Jicheng called to ask, "Two soldiers are being beaten up, what should we do?" "Save them!" Yin Shengxi put down the phone and immediately sent six capable young men to rescue them. After the soldiers escaped danger, they also picked up the soldiers' lost bags, helmets, etc., and handed them over to the nearby police station.

At 4 a.m. on June 4, it was drizzling. A certain unit of the martial law troops was hungry and cold in the Qianmen area. Wang Shuanxiang, a Communist Party member from the affiliated market of "Big Bowl Tea," called to ask, "The troops are in trouble, how do we solve it?" Yin Shengxi immediately instructed, "Whatever the market has, whatever the soldiers need, supply it all." The clear leadership support gave Wang Shuanxiang great encouragement. He took out raincoats, carried out snacks and drinks, and brought hot noodle soup, inviting the soldiers to the Old She Tea House to have a meal.

Due to the cold and damp weather, starting from June 4, "Big Bowl Tea" sent hot water to the troops every 20 minutes. The regiment commander of the unit said that more than 1,000 soldiers drank the hot water from "Big Bowl Tea." Later, the soldiers of the unit sent a plaque that read, "Firm stance, clear banner, friends in adversity, hearts united..."

After experiencing the turmoil and riots, "Big Bowl Tea" is now more vibrant than ever.

    清醒的“大碗茶”
    本报记者　郭嘉
    在学潮、动乱、暴乱袭扰北京的日子里，北京大碗茶商贸集团公司的1000多名职工，自觉分清是非、明辨善恶，以自己的实际行动，唱出了令人感佩的“三部曲”。
            “不予接待”
    自古以来，茶馆就是一个信息灵通、人员集散的地方。
    “大碗茶”所属的“老舍茶馆”，坐落于寸土寸金的前门闹市。北京市劳动模范、全国“五一”劳动奖章获得者尹盛喜就是这里的“总掌柜”。
    然而，以品茗、叙怀、谈唱集于一堂的老舍茶馆，在学潮前夕，也面临了一场政治抉择。
    今年3月18日上午，两个男女青年来到西珠市口66号公司总经理办公室，自称是“中国科技大学研究所”的，说他们在4月份要搞一个中国名人报告会，拟请该公司总经理尹盛喜参加，建议会址定在老舍茶馆。公司的工作人员鉴于总经理不在，未置可否。
    3月22日，尹盛喜在茶馆的“龙井”雅间与包括上次两人在内的6人见了面，其中有两人年纪在50开外。对方谈到，今年是“五四”运动70周年，中央不准备搞什么大的活动了，只搞些小型的座谈及报告会，认为在老舍茶馆开会比较理想。准备举办10场报告会，每场报告会可由尹总经理主持。
    尹盛喜在听完他们的叙述后，问及有哪些人作报告。对方迅即递过一张打字后复印的名单，第一个是“方励之”。尹盛喜看后立即感到其中有诈，起身退席。在这之后，对方还多次打来电话，表示“哪怕一场也行”。尹盛喜和“大碗茶”的其他同志一致回话“不予接待”。
    据了解，北京老舍茶馆自开张3个多月以来，共接待中外顾客2.8万多人次，有上百个社会团体包场举行各种文化交流活动。只有“中国名人报告会”被拒绝了。
    事后，尹盛喜告诉记者：“我们老舍茶馆的宗旨，是为了‘振兴祖国茶文化，扶植民族艺术花’，在我们这儿举行活动，必须有一个大前提，那就是坚决维护四项基本原则。如果我们同意他们来开报告会，‘大碗茶’就有可能变为‘西单民主墙’。”
            “不许游行”
    前门与天安门，只隔一个广场。广场上所发生的事情，不可能不影响到“大碗茶”。
    游行伊始，“大碗茶”党委就及时召开党员经理会议，明确规定“单位职工不准擅离职守”。党支部先后召开了多次会议，告诫职工“听政府的，咱们不能去游行。”
    为便于职工领会中央精神，他们在“大碗茶”门口架设了两个高音喇叭，给过往行人和本系统职工宣传李鹏总理在首都党政军干部会议上的讲话，讲解《人民日报》“4·26”社论。
    为防止事态扩大，他们配合公安部门，组织了由100多名职工参加的“厂卫队”，准备了棍子和灭火器材，以便发生歹徒哄抢商店时应急。
    5月中旬以后，游行队伍充塞前门市场，职工中开始出现波动。有的说，既然上街游行的人有知识界、新闻界的，甚至还有国务院机关的人，为啥咱们不去？
    出现上述问题，尹盛喜没有过份责备职工，而是耐心细致地说服教育，并在所属各部门立下规矩：“如果谁去游行，一律除名。”
    5月19日，街上到处传谣说，“大碗茶”有人打着横幅游行去了，尹盛喜当即四处派人带着相机寻找，结果一个也没有找到。
    6月2日，尹盛喜叫人在前门“大碗茶”所属商场，挂起“坚决呼吁拆除天安门广场民主之神”、“坚决反对动乱”的巨大竖幅。宣武区委书记李瀛紧握尹盛喜的手说：“老尹，你做得好哇！”
    6月3日上午，五六个人气势汹汹来到大碗茶装饰公司，扬言要见尹盛喜，公司当班职工刘玉珍告诉老尹不在。这伙人嚷道：“他不是支持李鹏吗？让他上那儿支持去。”说完，拍了拍腰间的匕首，扬长而去。晚上，一伙歹徒将商场上的巨大条幅焚烧了。
    在尹盛喜的带动下，“大碗茶”没有一人参与游行、声援和闹事。
            “一概供应”
    5月20日，李鹏总理签署戒严令，但部队进城受阻。
    5月30日，尹盛喜带领“大碗茶”部分职工前往六里桥一带慰问受阻官兵。
    6月3日夜，“大碗茶”所属的前门第一门市部门前人声嘈杂，经理王季辰打电话问，有两位解放军同志被围打，怎么办？“救！”尹盛喜放下电话，立即派去6名精干的小伙子前往营救。解放军同志化险为夷后，他们还将两个战士丢失的挎包、钢盔等拾起交给了附近的派出所。
    4日凌晨，微雨蒙蒙，戒严部队某部在前门一带饥寒交困。“大碗茶”下属商场的共产党员王栓祥来电话问：“部队有困难，怎么解决？”尹盛喜当即嘱咐：“凡是商场有的，凡是解放军需要的，一概供应。”领导旗帜鲜明地支持，给王栓祥以很大的鼓舞，他拿出雨衣，抬出点心、饮料，端来香喷喷的热汤面，把部队同志请到老舍茶馆就座进餐。
    因天气阴湿较冷，从6月4日始，“大碗茶”每隔20分钟给该部队烧送一炉开水。该部团长说，有1000多士兵喝了“大碗茶”的开水。后来，该部队同志送来一面锦旗，上面写着：“立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，患难之交，肝胆相照”……
    经历了动乱和暴乱之后的“大碗茶”，如今比往日更加欢腾了。
