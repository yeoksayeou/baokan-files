The construction of the Qinhuangdao Marine Sports Venue for the 1990 Beijing Asian Games is nearing completion. The fifth Asian Sailing Championships will be held here on September 17.

This marine sports venue is located between Qinhuangdao Port and the seaside resort of Beidaihe. It is surrounded by forests to the northwest and faces the Tang River estuary to the east, offering a very serene environment. The waters around Qinhuangdao have small tidal differences, good water quality, and gentle beaches, making it an ideal location for marine sports. The main construction projects include an athletes' village that can accommodate 900 athletes and judges, a command and service building, three piers, and other ancillary facilities. The command and service building is uniquely designed, resembling a white giant ship from a distance. The top command level is cleverly constructed with tea-colored glass and white mosaic to form the shape of "11," symbolizing that the marine sports events of the 11th Asian Games will be held here. The building is equipped with a first-aid room, sail measurement room, athlete gender and drug testing room, and various modern communication facilities for journalists. In front of the command and service building, there is a spacious ceremonial area. Further ahead is a long breakwater enclosing a 2,000-square-meter ship washing area and an 8,300-square-meter ship parking area. Outside the venue is the marine competition area where athletes will compete.

Currently, the project is nearing completion. The builders are cleaning up the construction site and landscaping the courtyard to welcome athletes from various countries and regions in Asia with a more beautiful environment.

    秦皇岛海上运动场工程近尾声
    亚洲帆船锦标赛九月在此举行
    新华社石家庄8月24日电　（通讯员范怀良）1990年北京亚运会秦皇岛海上运动场工程已进入尾声。9月17日将在这里举行第五届亚洲帆船锦标赛。
    这个海上运动场在秦皇岛港和避暑胜地北戴河之间，西北侧林地环绕，东濒汤河口，环境十分幽雅。加上秦皇岛海域潮差小、水质好、海滩平缓，是理想的海上运动场地。该工程主要建设项目有，可供900名运动员、裁判员下榻的运动员村，指挥服务楼，三个码头及其他附属设施。指挥服务楼的建筑别具特色，远眺形似一艘白色的巨轮，顶端的指挥层用茶色玻璃和白色马赛克巧妙地构成“11”的造型，象征着第十一届亚运会海上运动项目的比赛将在这里举行；楼内设施齐全，有救护室、量帆室、运动员性别和兴奋剂检查室以及为记者准备的各种现代化通讯设备等。指挥服务楼前建有宽阔的仪式场地，再往前是一道长长的防浪堤，围栏着2000平方米的洗船场和8300平方米的停船场。场外则是运动员角逐的海上竞赛场。
    目前，工程已接近结束，建设者们正在清理施工现场和绿化庭院，以更美的环境喜迎亚洲各国和地区运动员的到来。
