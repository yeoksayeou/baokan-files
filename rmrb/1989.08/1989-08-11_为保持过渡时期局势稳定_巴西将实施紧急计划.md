	To maintain stability during the final 7 months of its term and ensure a smooth transition between the old and new governments, the Brazilian government has formulated an "emergency plan" for the transition period.

	According to information from the Brazilian presidential palace, this emergency economic plan mainly includes two aspects: internally, it continues to focus on controlling inflation, and externally, it adopts the principle of "repaying debts within its means." As the first step in implementing the plan, the following three measures will be taken: first, selling a large batch of public housing, including ministerial residences, and other real estate to increase the country's financial income; second, immediately privatizing 14 large state-owned enterprises and dissolving and merging a number of state-owned enterprises and government agencies; third, further opening the domestic market to increase the import of capital goods and some consumer goods, thereby stimulating industrial production growth and activating the market.

	In terms of paying off foreign debts, given that foreign creditor banks have clearly stated that they are only willing to reach agreements with the next Brazilian government to reduce debts and provide new loans, the "emergency plan" has therefore decided to adopt the strategy of "repaying debts within its means."

    为保持过渡时期局势稳定
    巴西将实施紧急计划
    本报巴西利亚8月10日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西政府为了保持在最后7个月执政期间内的局势稳定，使大选和新旧政权的交接顺利进行，制订了一套过渡时期的“紧急计划”。
    据来自巴西总统府的消息，这项紧急经济计划主要包括两方面的内容，对内仍以抑制通货膨胀为主要目标，对外实行“量力还债”的原则。作为实施计划的第一步，首先推行以下3条措施：第一，出售包括部长级住宅在内的一大批公共房屋和其它不动产，增加国家的资金收入；第二，将14家大的国营企业立即转为私人经营，并撤销合并一批国营事业单位和政府机构；第三，进一步开放国内市场，增加资本货物和一部分消费物资的进口，从而刺激工业生产增长和活跃市场。
    在支付外债方面，鉴于外国债权银行已经明确表示只愿意同下届巴西政府达成减免债务和提供新贷款的协议，因此“紧急计划”中确定采取“量力还债”的对策。
