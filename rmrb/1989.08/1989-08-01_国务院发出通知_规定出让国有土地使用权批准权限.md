The State Council recently issued the "Notice on the Approval Authority for Transfer of State-Owned Land Use Rights," clearly defining the approval authority for various levels of government in transferring state-owned land use rights.

The Notice points out that over the past two years, some regions have, in accordance with relevant provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China, experimented with the paid transfer and assignment of state-owned land use rights. This has played a certain role in promoting rational and economical land use, attracting foreign investment, and promoting economic development. However, there have been some disorderly practices in the approval authority for transferring state-owned land use rights, which is not conducive to land management.

The Notice stipulates that the approval authority for the paid transfer of state-owned land use rights is the same as that for the administrative allocation of state-owned land use rights. According to the provisions of the Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China regarding the approval authority for state construction land, the approval authority for the transfer of state-owned land use rights is as follows: for cultivated land of 1,000 mu (approximately 166.67 acres) or more, and other land of 2,000 mu (approximately 333.33 acres) or more, approval is required from the State Council; for cultivated land of 3 mu (approximately 0.5 acres) or less, and other land of 10 mu (approximately 1.67 acres) or less, approval is required from the county-level people's government; the approval authority of the people's governments of prefecture-level cities and autonomous prefectures is decided by the standing committees of the people's congresses of provinces and autonomous regions.

The Notice also stipulates that the land use indicators for the transfer of state-owned land use rights must be included in the annual land use plan allocated by the state. Without approval, the plan cannot be exceeded. For the transfer of state-owned land use rights in one go, it is not allowed to "divide into smaller parts" to expand the approval authority in disguise. The Notice requires that all levels of people's governments strengthen their leadership and management of the work related to the transfer of state-owned land use rights. For state-owned land whose use rights have already been transferred before the issuance of the Notice, a thorough review must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Notice. Any cases that do not comply with the regulations must be reprocessed for approval and reported to the land management department at the next higher level for record.

    国务院发出通知
    规定出让国有土地使用权批准权限
    新华社北京8月1日电  国务院近日发出了《关于出让国有土地使用权批准权限的通知》，就各地政府行使出让国有土地使用权的批准权限做出了明确规定。
    《通知》指出，近两年来，部分地区根据《中华人民共和国宪法》和《中华人民共和国土地管理法》的有关规定，试行国有土地使用权有偿出让和转让，在合理、节约用地，吸引外资，促进经济发展等方面起到了一定的作用。但是，各地在出让国有土地使用权的批准权限上也出现了一些混乱现象，不利于土地管理。
    《通知》规定，政府对有偿出让国有土地使用权的批准权限，与行政划拨国有土地使用权的批准权限相同。按照《中华人民共和国土地管理法》中关于国家建设用地批准权限的规定，出让国有土地使用权的批准权限为：耕地1000亩以上、其他土地2000亩以上的，由国务院批准；耕地三亩以下、其他土地10亩以下的，由县级人民政府批准；省辖市、自治州人民政府的批准权限，由省、自治区人大常委会决定。
    《通知》还规定，出让使用权的国有土地用地指标，要纳入国家下达的地方年度建设用地计划，未经批准，不得突破。对一次出让使用权的国有土地不得“化整为零”，变相扩大批准权限。《通知》要求各级人民政府对国有土地使用权出让工作要加强领导，加强管理。在《通知》发布前已经出让使用权的国有土地，要按《通知》的规定认真进行一次清理，凡与规定不符的，必须重新办理批准手续，并报上一级土地管理部门备案。
