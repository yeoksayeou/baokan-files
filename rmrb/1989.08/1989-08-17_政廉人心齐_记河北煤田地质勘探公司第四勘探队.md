In the Fourth Exploration Team of the Hebei Coalfield Geological Exploration Company, there are few discussions among the people about the amount of bonuses or the level of benefits. Although the working conditions are quite harsh, and many workers have to live separately from their families for long periods, people do not want to transfer out and have been completing their exploration tasks ahead of schedule year after year. When asked about the reasons, the young team party secretary, Liu Heping, said, "We rely on clean governance to enhance the cohesion of the team."

The team has over 600 employees and is responsible for the geological exploration of coalfields in northern Hebei. The work sites are distributed in Kangbao, Guyuan, Yu County, Yangyuan, and Tianjin Xiaocang, covering a distance of over a thousand miles. In recent years, some workers, seeing that some units have higher bonuses and better working conditions, have had thoughts of "changing jobs." The team party committee believes that coalfield exploration work is arduous and the benefits are not high, but managing a good enterprise is not just about money. The integrity of the leadership in serving the public and sharing hardships with the people can also enhance the cohesion of the enterprise.

In recent years, all major matters of the team, especially those involving the interests of the people, have been made public and discussed with the workers, allowing the people to supervise. Each time housing is allocated, workers are recruited, or workers are converted to staff, the people are allowed to discuss it first. When allocating housing, priority is given to workers on the front line. Although the living conditions of the team leaders are not spacious, they also have to line up with the people according to the points. Some have not yet been allocated new housing. In March of this year, a vocational school in the coalfield exploration system was recruiting a batch of workers' children. There were many applicants. The team leaders clearly stated that the selection process would be fully transparent. The relevant departments of the team conducted investigations on the applicants and selected 2 people based on merit, and publicly announced the results, which satisfied the people.

The leaders of the Fourth Team have realized that actions in clean governance are the most convincing. Last year, the relevant departments at a higher level allocated a "Volga" sedan to them. After repeated discussions, the main responsible comrades of the team unanimously agreed that the team still has difficulties at present and cannot show off or be extravagant. One car is enough for work.

While maintaining their own integrity, the leaders of the Fourth Team also regard whether they can share hardships with the people as one of the standards for whether a cadre is qualified. Whenever difficulties are encountered during construction, the team leaders always rush to the scene in a timely manner and fight alongside the cadres and workers on the front line. Last year during the rainy season, a drilling rig in Yangyuan encountered a flash flood while moving to a new position, and the road was washed away, leaving the truck stranded halfway. Upon receiving the news, team leader Wang Xifeng led more than 40 office cadres to the scene. The 58-year-old old team leader led the way, and together with the workers, moved the water pumps and carried the drilling rig. During festivals, the team leaders also brought festival supplies to the construction sites to celebrate with the workers, strengthening the relationship between the cadres and the people.

In recent years, the team has successively been awarded the title of "Advanced Unit" in the national coal industry and Zhangjiakou City, and has been rated as a "Disciplined and Law-abiding Team" in Zhangjiakou City.

    政廉人心齐
    ——记河北煤田地质勘探公司第四勘探队
    刘军
    在河北煤田地质勘探公司第四勘探队，很少听到人们对奖金多少、待遇高低的议论。尽管作业条件比较艰苦，许多职工长年两地分居，但人们却不愿调走，并且连年超额完成勘探任务。问及原因时，年轻的队党委书记刘鹤峰说，我们是靠廉政建设增强了队伍的凝聚力。
    这个队有职工600多人，担负河北北部地区煤田勘探任务。作业点分布在康保、沽源、蔚县、阳原和天津下仓等地，战线长达千里。近年来，一些工人看到有的单位奖金高、工作条件好，产生“跳槽”的想法。队党委认为，煤田勘探工作艰苦、待遇也不高，但是，办好一个企业并不是光靠钱，领导干部廉洁奉公、与群众同甘共苦也是可以增强企业凝聚力的。
    几年来，凡队里的大事，特别是涉及群众利益的事都予以公开，交职工讨论，让群众监督。每次分房、招工、转干都让群众先酝酿。分配住房时，首先照顾在第一线的工人。队里的领导干部虽然住房都不宽裕，但也得与群众一起按分数排队。有的至今还未分到新房。今年3月，煤田勘探系统的一所中专要招收一批职工子女，报名的人较多。队领导明确表示选拔工作要全部公开。队有关部门对报考者进行了考察，择优选送了2人，并张榜公布，群众很满意。
    四队的领导体会到，在廉政建设上实实在在的行动最有说服力。去年上级有关部门调拨给他们一台“伏尔加”小轿车。队里几位主要负责同志反复商量后一致认为，目前队里还有困难，不能摆谱，讲阔气，有一辆车能工作就行。
    在搞好自身廉洁的同时，四队领导还把能不能与群众同甘共苦看成干部是否合格的标准之一。每当施工中遇到困难，队领导总是及时赶到现场，与干部职工共同战斗在第一线。去年雨季，在阳原施工的钻机在搬迁井位时遇到山洪暴发，山路被冲毁，汽车截在半路。得到消息后，队长王锡文带领40多名机关干部赶赴现场。58岁的老队长身先士卒，和工人们一起搬水泵、抬钻机。逢年过节，队领导还带着节日用品到施工现场与工人们一起欢度节日，密切了干群关系。
    几年来，这个队先后荣获全国煤炭系统和张家口市先进单位称号，并被评为“张家口市纪律严明队”。
