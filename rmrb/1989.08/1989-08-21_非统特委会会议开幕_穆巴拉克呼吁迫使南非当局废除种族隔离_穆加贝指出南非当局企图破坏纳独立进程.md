Xinhua News Agency, Harare, August 21st

The Special Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on Southern African Problems held its fourth meeting today in Harare. The Chairman of the OAU and President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, called on the member states of the OAU and all African peoples to work together to make peace, development, and progress a reality in Africa.

Mubarak made this appeal at the opening of the fourth meeting of the OAU Special Committee on Southern African Problems.

Mubarak said that the process of Namibian independence is moving forward with an unstoppable momentum. By November, after the elections, Namibia will become an independent sovereign state. The Angolan government and UNITA reached a ceasefire agreement on June 22, ending a 14-year civil war and achieving national reconciliation. The Mozambican government has also recently engaged with the leaders of the resistance movement to seek a political solution to the 13-year civil war. He said that the current situation indicates that the entire African continent is experiencing a trend towards reconciliation.

Mubarak said that the South African authorities are still unwilling to abandon the policy of apartheid. Therefore, the OAU should continue to exert pressure on the South African authorities to force them to abolish the inhuman apartheid system.

Mubarak pointed out that the South African authorities should unconditionally release the black leader Nelson Mandela and lift the ban on anti-apartheid organizations.

The host of the meeting, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, said at the opening ceremony that since the start of the Namibian independence process, many serious problems have arisen. Many reports show that the South African authorities are attempting to sabotage and manipulate the Namibian independence process. The OAU Special Committee and all African peoples firmly believe that free and fair elections are the only legitimate path to represent the true aspirations of the Namibian people.

Mugabe said that the main requirements for ensuring free and fair elections are: not setting obstacles for voter registration, establishing an administrative body that is impartial to all competing parties, free campaigning and speaking, and ensuring the security of all citizens. However, reports from Namibia indicate that not only are these important conditions not fully met, but the administrative officials and institutions appointed by the South African authorities blatantly violate Resolution 435.

Mugabe said that the people of this region, who have long suffered from the apartheid regime in Pretoria, repeatedly emphasize that without establishing a democratic system in South Africa, there can be no true peace, development, and progress in any country in Southern Africa. Mugabe said that the struggle of the South African people for democracy and peace is ongoing. If these goals can be achieved through peaceful negotiations, it would be a desirable approach. He said that the oppressed people of South Africa are prepared for serious and sincere negotiations with the perpetrators of the apartheid policy. The South African authorities have also announced their willingness to seek peaceful solutions. Therefore, they must convince people that their attitude is genuine. He also said that this is one of the main issues that this meeting must clarify. He also hopes that the OAU Special Committee will support the struggle of the South African people in their negotiations with the Pretoria authorities.

    非统特委会会议开幕
    穆巴拉克呼吁迫使南非当局废除种族隔离
    穆加贝指出南非当局企图破坏纳独立进程
    本报哈拉雷8月21日电　记者李景卫报道：非统主席、埃及总统穆巴拉克呼吁非统成员国和全体非洲人民共同努力，使和平、发展与进步在非洲成为现实。
    穆巴拉克主席是在今天在这里开幕的非统特别委员会关于南部非洲问题第4次会议上发出这一呼吁的。
    穆巴拉克说，纳米比亚独立进程正在以不可阻挡的趋势向前发展。到今年11月大选以后，纳米比亚即将成为一个独立的主权国家；安哥拉政府和安盟于6月22日达成停火协议，结束了持续14年的内战，实现了民族和解；莫桑比克政府也于最近与抵抗运动领导人进行接触，寻求政治解决长达13年内战的途径。他说，目前的形势表明整个非洲出现了和解势头。
    穆巴拉克说，南非当局仍然不愿放弃种族隔离政策。因此，非统应对南非当局继续施加压力，迫使它废除非人道的种族隔离制度。
    穆巴拉克指出，南非当局应无条件地释放黑人领袖纳尔逊·曼德拉，并对反种族隔离组织解除禁令。
    会议的东道主、津巴布韦总统穆加贝在会议开幕式上说，纳米比亚独立进程开始以来，碰到了许多严重问题。很多报道证明，南非当局企图破坏和操纵纳米比亚独立进程。非统特别委员会以及全体非洲人民都坚决认为，自由公正的选举是代表纳米比亚人民真正主张的唯一合法途径。
    穆加贝说，保证自由、公正选举的主要要求是：不对选民登记设置障碍，设立一个对所有竞选党派都无偏见的行政机构，自由竞选和演说，做好所有公民的治安工作。然而，来自纳米比亚的报道表明，不但这些重要的条件不够完善，而且南非当局任命的行政管理人员及其机构公然违反435号决议。
    穆加贝说，深受比勒陀利亚种族隔离政权之害的这一地区人民反复强调，不在南非建立一个民主制度，在南部非洲的任何国家都不能有真正的和平、发展和进步。穆加贝说，南非人民争取民主与和平的斗争正在进行。如果这些目标能够通过和平谈判实现，将是一个可取的办法。他说，被压迫的南非人民已作好与种族隔离政策的推行者进行认真和诚恳谈判的准备。南非当局也曾宣布他们准备寻求和平解决的办法。那么，他们就必须使人们确信他们的态度是认真的。他还说，这是这次会议要明确的主要问题之一。他还希望非统特别委员会支持南非人民在同比勒陀利亚当局谈判过程中的斗争。
