Recently, there has been a noticeable increase in cases of criminals stealing and using checks illegally. The Weicheng District Court in our city has handled 7 such cases involving 19 people in a relatively short period, with the total amount of money involved exceeding 71,000 yuan.

Most of the check thieves are temporary workers. For example, Ma Xiaolong, a temporary worker at the Weicheng District Moving Company, stole a check from the dispatcher's bag on September 6 last year. The next afternoon, he conspired with another temporary worker, Zhao Chengjun, to deceive the Weicheng District Materials Bureau into purchasing steel materials worth over 19,000 yuan. Another instance involves the individual entrepreneur Guo Jiayou and the temporary worker Zhang Qingquan, who stole a check from the Weicheng Audio Equipment Store and used it to deceive the Weicheng District Electrical Appliances Store into purchasing two Yamaha 80 motorcycles and two helmets, worth over 13,000 yuan.

The victims of these thefts or frauds are mostly state-owned and collective enterprises. According to the criminals' confessions, "People in state-owned stores are complacent and easy to deceive." Criminals Cai Kun and three others stole 26 bank transfer checks from Weifang No. 6 Middle School and stamped them with the seal of Dongfeng Department Store. The checks were altered beyond recognition, but they managed to deceive the market department of the Municipal Guesthouse into purchasing high-end cigarettes worth 5,100 yuan in one go.

In the past, criminals who stole and used checks mostly acted alone, but now they often work in groups to commit fraud.

We hope that all units will remain vigilant and strictly enforce the management, use, and examination procedures for checks to prevent being deceived and defrauded.

### 警惕不法分子盗用支票

    警惕不法分子盗用支票
    近来，一些不法分子盗用支票犯罪案件明显增加。我市潍城区法院，在一个不算长的时间内，受理这类案件7件19人，犯罪金额为7.1万多元。
    盗用支票者多数是临时工。如潍城区搬运公司临时工马晓龙，去年9月6日从公司调度员提包里盗窃支票1张，次日下午伙同临时工赵成军从潍城区物资局骗购价值1.9万多元钢材。又如个体户郭家有和临时工张庆泉盗窃潍城音响经营部支票1张，到潍城区交电商场骗购了重庆雅马哈80摩托车两辆、头盔两个，价值1.3万多元。
    被盗或被骗的多是国营、集体单位。据罪犯供述：“国营商店的人思想麻痹，容易成功。”盗窃犯蔡坤等4人盗窃潍坊六中银行转账支票26张，盖上东风商场的收款章。支票被涂改得不像样子，可他们到市招待所商品部竟一次骗购了价值5100元高档香烟。
    过去犯罪分子盗用支票主要是单独作案，现在多是合伙行骗。
    希望各单位提高警惕，严格支票保管、使用和审查制度，防止上当受骗。
