The conference emphasized the need to use various means to systematically and coordinately address the issues of supporting the best and restricting the worst.

	BEIJING, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- To reverse the situation of low product quality and poor enterprise performance, it is necessary to fully utilize administrative, economic, technological, legal, and public opinion means to systematically and coordinately address the issues, and to seriously implement the policy of "supporting the best and restricting the worst." This is the opinion emphasized at the national conference summarizing the ten years of implementing total quality management.

	The conference opened today in Beijing. CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng jointly sent a congratulatory message to the conference, extending cordial greetings to all the workers and technical personnel across the country who are engaged in quality management work, and calling for the promotion and popularization of total quality management to gradually foster a social atmosphere where everyone cares about quality (the full text will be published separately).

	Over the past decade, China's total quality management work has adhered to the principle of "self-reliance, learning from others, integrating and innovating, and forming our own system." It has gone through the stages of experimentation and promotion, leading to significant changes and updates in the quality concepts and management methods of a considerable number of enterprises. By the end of last year, 63 enterprises in the country had won the highest quality honor -- the National Quality Management Award, and 3,742 products had won the National Quality Product Award, National Military-Industrial Quality Product Award, and National Quality Food Award. Additionally, 193 engineering projects had won the National Quality Engineering Award. When combined with national-level and ministry-, provincial-, and municipal-level quality products, the current quality product rate in China has reached over 20%. In the fields of electronics, chemicals, light textiles, aerospace, machinery, and nuclear industry, there are already a number of products whose quality has reached or is close to the international or advanced international level.

	However, in recent years, under the condition of economic overheating, the macro-quality management environment and order have been poor, interfering with quality work and causing some enterprises to experience a decline and slump in product quality. At today's conference, Song Jiyun, President of the China Quality Management Association, pointed out that in the next six years, China's quality management workers and the broad masses of workers should focus on the following main goals:

	-- Strive to create a large number of products that meet the standards of the 1980s, and strive to have 10%-15% of products with technical performance and quality reaching the advanced international level of the late 1980s, creating new international brands in export products.

	-- All enterprises should closely combine the "double increase, double decrease" campaign, actively carry out mass activities such as reducing defective products by half, improving the first-pass yield, and quality assurance, and quality management small group activities, seeking benefits from quality management.

	-- In the 8,200 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises nationwide, focus on selecting 3,000 enterprises that are related to the national economy and people's livelihood and foreign exchange earnings, and establish a sound quality system based on the actual situation, using the "Quality Management and Quality Assurance" series of national standards, leading other enterprises to actively promote total quality management.

	-- Actively adjust the structure and provide effective services to help some collective and township enterprises that meet the requirements of industrial policies to quickly reverse the situation of weak quality management foundation and out-of-control product quality.

	This conference was organized by the China Quality Management Association. Song Jiyun made a work report titled "Ten Years of Implementing Total Quality Management" at the conference. Gao Zhenning, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, Xu Zhijian, Director of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, as well as Lü Dong and Yuan Baohua, also spoke at the conference.

    江泽民李鹏致贺推行全面质量管理十年总结大会
    形成大家关心质量的社会风气
    会议强调运用多种手段系统协调治理扶优限劣
    本报北京8月29日讯　记者董焕亮报道：扭转产品质量低、企业效益差的状况，必须充分运用行政的、经济的、技术的、法律的、舆论的手段，进行系统的协调的治理，认真实行“扶优限劣”。这是全国推行全面质量管理十年总结大会强调的意见。
    这次大会于今日在北京开幕。中共中央总书记江泽民、国务院总理李鹏联名向大会发出贺信，向全国从事质量管理工作的广大职工和技术人员致以亲切的问候，要求大力宣传和推广全面质量管理，逐步形成大家都关心质量的社会风气（全文另发）。
    我国全面质量管理工作，坚持“以我为主，博采众长，融合提炼，自成一家”的方针，在近10年中经历了试验阶段和推广阶段，促使相当数量的企业质量观念和质量管理方式发生了转变和更新，是富有成效的。到去年为止，全国有63个企业获得了最高的质量荣誉——国家质量管理奖，有3742种产品荣获国家优质产品奖、国家军工优质产品奖和国家优质食品奖，还有193项工程建设项目荣获国家优质工程奖。把国家级和部委、省市级的优质产品统计在一起，我国目前的优质品率已经达到20％以上。电子、化工、轻纺、航天、机械和核工业中，已经有一批产品质量达到或接近国际水平或国际先进水平。
    然而，近年来在经济过热的情况下，宏观质量管理的环境和秩序欠佳，对质量工作产生干扰，致使一些企业出现了产品质量下降和滑坡的问题。在今天的大会上，中国质量管理协会理事长宋季文指出，在今后6年中，我国质量管理工作者和广大职工要围绕以下主要目标开展工作：
    ——努力创造一大批达到80年代水平的产品，力争有10％—15％的产品技术性能和质量达到80年代末的国际先进水平，在出口产品中创出新的国际名牌。
    ——所有企业要紧密结合双增双节运动，积极开展废次品减半、提高一次合格率、质量信得过和无次品机台等群众性活动和质量管理小组活动，向质量管理要效益。
    ——在全国8200个大中型工业企业中，重点选择关系国计民生和出口创汇的3000个企业，从实际出发，采用《质量管理和质量保证》系列国家标准，建立起健全的质量体系，带动其他企业积极推行全面质量管理。
    ——积极调整结构，提供有效服务，帮助符合产业政策要求的部分集体企业和乡镇企业，尽快扭转质量管理基础工作薄弱和产品质量失控的局面。
    这次会议是由中国质量管理协会召开的，宋季文在会议上作了《推行全面质量管理的十年》的工作报告。中国科协副主席高振宁、国家技术监督局局长徐志坚，以及吕东、袁宝华等也在会上讲了话。
