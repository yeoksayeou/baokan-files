China's Air Force has maintained a flight safety record of around 0.3 per 10,000 flight hours for serious accidents in recent years, keeping its flight safety among the world's best.

A group of aviation regiments and flight academies that have long ensured flight safety and made outstanding contributions to the modernization of the Air Force recently gathered in Beijing to share their experiences. They were also commended and rewarded by the Air Force leadership.

The rate of serious accidents per 10,000 flight hours is a key indicator of the Air Force's safety level. According to relevant data, the Air Force currently has 11 aviation regiments and academies that have maintained flight safety for more than five consecutive years, with the longest record being 22 years.
