Tangshan Shuts Down Over 100 Unqualified Small Coal Mines

People's Daily reports that Tangshan City in Hebei Province has shut down and filled over 100 unqualified individual farmer coal mines this year. Additionally, the mine managers of two illegal coal mines, which ignored safety regulations and resulted in the deaths of two farmers, have been arrested and prosecuted.

In recent years, hundreds of small coal mines operated by farmers have sprung up in Tangshan City, mostly located in the Kaiping and Dongkuang districts. Due to poor management and rampant illegal mining, these mines have severely disrupted the safe production of state-owned and local coal mines. In response, Tangshan City's government and relevant law enforcement agencies have taken decisive measures to conduct a comprehensive cleanup and rectification. Mines that do not meet mining conditions, lack safety facilities, and exploit state-owned mines have been sealed and filled. The managers of two illegal coal mines, Jia Baozhong and Jin Li, who recklessly operated their mines and caused the deaths of two farmers, have been arrested and prosecuted.

    唐山封填百余不合格小煤窑
    本报讯　河北省唐山市今年以来依法取缔封填100多座不合格个体农民小煤窑，并对无证开采，无视安全，造成人为死亡事故的两个体煤矿矿长予以逮捕法办。
    近几年，唐山市境内农民兴办的小煤窑数百座，大都分布在该市的开平、东矿两区。由于管理混乱，私采滥掘的现象屡禁不止，严重影响了国统煤矿和地方国营煤矿的安全生产。对此，唐山市各级政府和有关执法监督部门采取坚决果断措施、进行全面清理整顿，对那些不符合开采条件、缺乏安全防范设施、专吃大矿的一批地上“黑井”，全部查封，就地填平。两个私开煤井、冒险蛮干、致使两农民被砸死的个体煤矿矿长笪宝忠、金利二人被逮捕法办。　　（许贵元）
