To the Editor:

Recently, public security and industrial and commercial administration departments in some cities and counties of Jiangsu Province conducted a surprise inspection of scrap collection markets and discovered that some scrap collection stations, which claim to be "collecting scrap" but in reality are involved in buying and selling stolen goods, have become important channels for criminals to fence stolen items.

The inspection revealed that more than 20 percent of the collection stations operate without licenses. Some licensed collection stations also forget their duties and openly buy and sell state-prohibited items for profit. Additionally, some individual collectors who go from door to door are involved in theft and fraud, stopping at nothing. The Guangling Public Security Sub-bureau of Yangzhou City recently inspected 255 boats moored in the urban area and found that 10 percent of the boats were involved in buying and selling stolen goods and theft. The suburban Public Security Sub-bureau of Nantong City, in a one-day surprise inspection, checked 135 individual collectors going from door to door and found that 132 of them were operating without licenses. They confiscated 8.5 tons of stolen goods worth 350,000 yuan.

Most of the so-called scrap items collected are sold to township enterprises. According to an individual collector, his place is regularly visited by township enterprises from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to collect scarce industrial raw materials.

Due to the chaotic situation in scrap collection, it has objectively opened the door for criminals to fence stolen goods and has also given some people with inflated desires the opportunity to engage in illegal buying and selling. Some workers in certain factories frequently steal raw materials from their own factories to sell, and some even dismantle machine parts. There are also cases where factory workers collude with scrap collectors to divide the stolen goods.

The chaotic situation in scrap collection stations has reached a point where it must be rectified. It is suggested that relevant departments conduct a comprehensive inspection and rectification as soon as possible, strictly enforce national regulations, and stop unlicensed operations and prohibited collections to quickly block the channels for fencing stolen goods.

### 不能让收旧市场成为销赃渠道

    不能让收旧市场成为销赃渠道编辑同志：
    最近，江苏省部分市县公安、工商部门对收旧市场进行了一次突击检查，发现一些以“收旧”为名、实质收赃销赃的废品收购站，成了犯罪分子销赃的重要渠道。
    检查表明：无证收购站占收购站总数的百分之二十以上；一些有证收购站也见利忘义，公然收购国家禁售物资倒卖渔利。还有一些走门串户的个体收购者，偷窃诈骗，无所不为。扬州市广陵公安分局最近对停泊市区内河的二百五十五条船只检查，发现百分之十的船只从事收销赃和有盗窃行为。南通市郊区公安分局在一天突击清查中，检查了一百三十五名走门串户的收旧人员，发现无证经营者竟达一百三十二人，查收被盗的赃物八点五吨，价值三点五万元。
    这些收购得来的所谓废旧物品，绝大部分销往乡镇企业。据某个体户称，他那儿定期有江、浙一带地方的乡镇企业上门收货，对紧俏工业原料争相收购。
    由于废品收购的混乱状况，客观上为犯罪分子销赃打开了方便之门，也为一些私欲膨胀的人倒买倒卖大开了绿灯。有些工厂的少数工人经常偷窃本厂原料倒卖，有的甚至拆卸机器零部件，还有的与收旧人员内外勾结，平均分赃。
    废品收购站的混乱状况已到了非整顿不可的地步。建议有关部门尽快对其全面检查整顿，坚决按照国家有关规定要求，制止无证经营和违禁收购，尽快堵塞销赃渠道。
