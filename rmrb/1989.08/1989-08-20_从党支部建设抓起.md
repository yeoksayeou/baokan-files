	Strengthening Party Building from the Grassroots
	Bĕn Bào Píng Lùn Yuán

	In recent years, the rural areas of Henan Province's Xinyang Region and the Baoding Region's Coking Plant have consistently focused on the organizational, ideological, and work style construction of party branches, achieving notable results. Amidst the widespread bourgeois liberalization and the pervasive "money-first" mentality, the party branches in these areas have educated party members and the masses to adhere to the principle of "one central task and two basic points," demonstrating the cohesive and combative strength of a "fortress." These two exemplary cases, one urban and one rural, illustrate that with a strong party branch, the Party's correct decisions can be implemented at the grassroots level, and party members and the masses can have a steadfast "backbone" in complex political struggles and during the reform and opening-up process. Party building should start from the construction of party branches.

	In recent years, many party branches in urban and rural areas have been weak and ineffective. Many party branches have abandoned normal organizational activities. In some cases, the leadership of party branches has shifted from dedicated party members to those with weak party spirit. In places and units where party branches are paralyzed or semi-paralyzed, party members who uphold the Four Cardinal Principles are ridiculed. One of the reasons for the turmoil and riots that occurred in Beijing after April and in many other places across the country is that many party branches have lost their role as combat fortresses. If every party branch were strong and effective, the broad masses of party members and the people would have a steadfast backbone, be able to maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee, and would not be misled or confused in times of turmoil; the organizers and plotters of the turmoil and riots would face resistance when advocating bourgeois liberalization; especially those who wear the cloak of party membership while promoting bourgeois liberalization would first face criticism and resistance within the party, and their counter-revolutionary intentions would be exposed and recognized by the broad masses of party members and the people.

	Starting from the construction of party branches is a valuable historical experience of our Party. During the war years, the slogan "Party branches are built in the companies" ensured that the Party's voice reached every soldier, and the Party organization could grasp the soldiers' thoughts in a timely manner. Revolutionary soldiers felt the Party was by their side, filling them with confidence in the success of the revolution. The same is true during the period of socialist construction. Whether in cities or rural areas, wherever party branch construction is strong and ideological and political work is firmly grasped, it can inspire and lead the masses to unite as one, work hard, and strive for progress. Looking back at the history of the Party, it can be said that whenever party branch construction is emphasized, the Party's cause develops smoothly; whenever it is relaxed or abandoned, the Party and the people pay a heavy price. The practice of more than a decade of reform also shows that where there are strong party branches, the construction of the "two civilizations" develops rapidly, and the Party's cohesion and the attraction of socialism are strong; where party branches are weak and ineffective, there is ideological chaos and a mess.

	Starting from the construction of party branches meets the requirements of the Party's tasks in the new period and also meets the wishes of the broad masses of party members and the people. The negative factors accompanying reform and opening-up have already emerged in large numbers and will continue to appear in the future, especially the decaying and backward ideas of the bourgeoisie, which will not disappear with the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots. To lead the people of the whole country to promote the healthy development of socialist modernization, the Party must rely on tens of thousands of party branches to educate party members and the masses to consciously adhere to the "one central task and two basic points," and resolutely fight against bourgeois liberalization. The broad masses of party members and the people also hope to continuously receive the Party's education, so as to firmly grasp the direction in political storms and during the reform and opening-up process. An excellent party member benefits greatly from the cultivation and guidance of the party branch, and a party member who forgets his duties and responsibilities is largely due to the party branch's lack of strict supervision and education.

	After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots, the entire Party and the people of the whole country are seriously reflecting on the past and thinking about the future. Many confused notions that weaken the Party's leadership and ideological and political work have begun to be clarified and corrected. This is an excellent opportunity to rectify and build party branches. Party committees at all levels should seize this opportunity and seriously examine the organizational, ideological, and work style aspects of party branches to see if they are effective. If, like the rural areas of Xinyang Region and the Baoding Region's Coking Plant, we start from the ideological and work style construction of party branch members and from strengthening organizational construction, the construction of party branches will be back on track.

    从党支部建设抓起
    本报评论员
    河南省信阳地区农村和保定地区焦化厂几年来坚持抓党支部的组织建设、思想建设、作风建设，抓出了成效。在资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥、“一切向钱看”的思想蔓延的情况下，那里的党支部教育党员和群众坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”，发挥了“堡垒”的凝聚力和战斗力。这一城一乡两个典型实践表明，有了坚强的党支部，党的正确决策就能够在基层贯彻，党员和群众在复杂的政治斗争和改革开放中就有了“主心骨”。党建工作，应该从支部建设抓起。
    近年来，党支部软弱无力的情况在城乡普遍存在。相当多的党支部放弃了正常的组织生活。有些党支部的领导权从忘我奉公的好党员手里转到党性不强的人手上。在党支部瘫痪或半瘫痪的地方和单位，坚持四项基本原则的党员受到嘲弄，4月以后在北京发生的动乱和暴乱、在全国许多地方发生的动乱，原因之一，就是不少党支部丧失了战斗堡垒作用。如果我们的每一个党支部都坚强有力，广大党员和群众就会有“主心骨”，能够做到和党中央保持一致，不会在动乱中不明真相，不辩是非；那些动乱和暴乱的组织者策划者在鼓吹资产阶级自由化的时候就会受到抗击；特别是那些披着党员外衣而大搞资产阶级自由化的人就会首先在党内受到批评和抵制，他们的反革命用心一旦暴露，就会被广大党员和群众所识破。
    从支部建设抓起，是我们党的一条宝贵的历史经验。战争年代，“支部建在连上”，党的声音每个战士能及时听到，战士的思想动态党组织也能及时掌握。革命战士感到党在身边，对革命成功充满信心。社会主义建设时期也是一样。无论是城市和农村，凡是党支部建设搞得好，坚定不移地抓思想政治工作，就能激励和带领群众团结一心，艰苦奋斗。纵观党的历史，可以说，什么时候重视抓了支部建设，党的事业就发展得很顺利，什么时候放松或者放弃了支部建设，党和人民就要付出沉重的代价。改革十多年来的实践也说明，哪里有坚强的党支部，哪里的“两个文明”建设就发展得快，党的凝聚力和社会主义的吸引力就强；哪里的党支部软弱无力，哪里就思想混乱，乌烟瘴气。
    从支部建设抓起，符合党在新时期的任务的要求，也符合广大党员和群众的愿望。改革开放伴随而来的不良因素现在已经不少，将来还会不断发生，特别是资产阶级的腐朽没落观念，不会随着这次平息反革命暴乱而消失。党要领导全国人民推动社会主义现代化事业健康发展，就要依赖成千上万的党支部教育党员和群众自觉坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”，坚决和资产阶级自由化作斗争。广大党员和群众也希望不断得到党的教育，从而在政治风浪和改革开放中坚定方向。一个优秀党员在很大程度上得益于党支部的培养和引导，一个党员忘记了自己的义务、责任，在很大程度上与党支部监督不严、教育不够有关系。
    平息反革命暴乱之后，全党、全国人民都在认真反思过去，思考未来。削弱党的领导和思想政治工作的许多糊涂观念已开始得到澄清和拨正。这是整顿和建设党支部的极好时机。各级党委应该抓住这个时机，认真地从组织、思想、作风上检查一下党支部是否有力。要是像信阳地区农村和保定地区焦化厂那样，先从党支部成员的思想和作风建设抓起，从搞好组织建设抓起，党支部的建设就会走上正轨。
