Capital martial law troops have celebrated the "August 1" Army Day in various forms, further boosting morale and strengthening military-civilian relations.

In recent days, the atmosphere at the martial law troops' camps has been filled with festive joy. Various performances organized by the Party Central Committee, state organs, and the Beijing Municipal Government have treated the soldiers to a visual feast. Various units and local residents have held get-togethers and garden parties, and soldier performance troupes have staged self-written programs. Many units have also screened films such as "Baise Uprising" and "Majestic Kunlun."

The martial law troops have also extensively carried out activities to support the government and love the people. Leaders of a certain martial law unit visited the Party committees and government departments of the counties where they are stationed, reminiscing about the friendship forged between the military and civilians during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Some martial law units held meetings to commend the deeds of the capital's people in supporting the suppression of the rebellion, conducted education on the army's purpose, nature, and tasks, and sent officers to the Jianwai District to solicit opinions from eight units including the Jianwai Hotel, Changfu Palace, and the International Building. Many martial law units organized medical, repair, and other service teams to go out into the streets to do good deeds for the people.

The martial law troops have also carried out lively and vivid education on revolutionary traditions. A certain unit invited more than 20 retired old Red Army soldiers to recall history, talk about traditions, and discuss the glorious course of the army's growth and development. The martial law troops stationed in Shahe and Tongxian also held military parades, showcasing their prowess.
