In my youth, I also wrote novels, but I never dared to try my hand at novels in the chapter format. I also worked on a few historical plays, but I never wrote historical novels. Therefore, I am an outsider when it comes to historical chapter novels.

However, I still read "Red Face Grievance" (i.e., "Chen Yuan Yuan," published by Shandong Literature and Art Publishing House). After reading it, I have some thoughts, which I will share briefly.

For works based on historical themes, whether novels or dramas, the most important issue is whether they capture the true essence of history. Without historical authenticity, there can be no artistic truth. A work that tells a story from history but constantly reveals modern thoughts, emotions, or even modern language loses its historical flavor and thus loses its artistic authenticity. This is a major taboo in writing historical themes!

However, when modern people write historical works, they are writing for modern readers. Especially when using the chapter format to write historical novels, it is important to make them interesting for modern readers. This means that one cannot be overly rigid about historical details. If writing a story from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, sticking strictly to history would make the ancient people's dialogue incomprehensible to modern readers. We would have to add footnotes to every sentence, even every word, which would be laughable. Therefore, the so-called historical authenticity refers to the work having a historical spirit and appearance.

In this regard, "Chen Yuan Yuan" is successful. The author did not use modern language, nor did they use stiff classical Chinese. The entire story is rich in historical flavor, proving that the author has put in a lot of effort in language and writing.

Historical novels written in the chapter format present another challenge. For example, classical chapter novels often use white description to depict characters, which modern young readers may not be accustomed to. On this issue, the author did not adhere to the old forms of the chapter format but innovated. This innovation is not simply borrowing new techniques from modern literature but creating something new based on the white description technique. To give an example, in the twelfth chapter of "Chen Yuan Yuan," the process of Emperor Tian Hong sending Chen Yuan Yuan to Wu Sangui is described. When Gong Dinghai came to visit him and advised him to give Yuan Yuan to Wu Sangui, he first got angry and did not see the guest off. Then, remembering Gong Dinghai's warning with the story of Shi Chong and Lu Yu, he began to fear the future. Later, Tian Hong went to see Chen Yuan Yuan, reluctantly parted with her, and agreed to marry her to Wu Sangui. It was truly a mix of "sour, jealous, angry, and regretful" feelings! At the banquet, after giving Yuan Yuan to Wu Sangui, during the drinking game, he couldn't help but feel heartbroken, drowning his sorrows in alcohol. After getting drunk, he still called out, "Yuan Yuan, oh! Yuan Yuan..." without stopping. This description is both detailed and concise, truly remarkable!

That is all I have to say.

Congratulations on the success of this long novel!

### 历史题材与章回体——读《陈圆圆》

    历史题材与章回体
    ——读《陈圆圆》
    陈白尘
    我在青年时代虽也写过小说，但对章回体小说未敢问津；我也曾搞过几个历史剧，但也没写过历史小说。因此对于历史章回小说，可说是门外汉。
    但我还是将《红颜怨》（即《陈圆圆》，山东文艺出版社出版）读了。而且读后也略有所感，随便说一说。
    历史题材的作品，不论小说或戏剧，其最首要的问题，在于它是否写出历史的真实来。没有历史的真实，便说不上艺术的真实。一部作品写的是历史上的故事，但不时透出现代人的思想、感情，甚至于是现代人的语言，便失去了历史感，也就失去了艺术上的真实！这是写历史题材的大忌！
    但现代人写作历史题材作品，是为现代人读的。尤其是用章回体写历史小说，让现代人读起来也饶有兴味，也就不能事无巨细，都拘泥于历史。写春秋战国时代的故事，如果拘泥历史，那古时人的讲话，现代人就无法听懂。我们要在每句话、甚至每个字上做注脚，岂非笑谈？因此，所谓历史的真实，指的是作品应有个历史的精神与风貌。
    在这一点上，《陈圆圆》是成功的。作者没有用现代语言，也没有用僵死的文言，整个故事又富历史感，证明作者在语言文字上是下了一番苦功的。
    历史小说而又用章回体，这又是一个难题。比如说，古典章回小说写人物多用白描手法，这对目前青年读者来说，不太习惯了。在这一问题上，作者没有拘泥于章回体的旧形式，而有所创新。这种创新，并非简单地从新文学里借用什么新手法，而是在白描手法的基础上有新的创造。要举例子，便是《陈圆圆》第十二章里描绘皇帝田弘送陈圆圆给吴三桂的过程。当龚鼎孽来拜见他，劝其以圆圆送给吴三桂时，他先是生气，连客人告辞都不相送；继之，想起龚鼎孽以石崇与绿珠故事的警告，不由为未来而恐惧；然后田弘遇去看陈圆圆，忍痛割爱，愿以圆圆嫁吴三桂。真是“又酸，又妒，又恼，又悔”！及至酒席筵前，既把圆圆送给了吴三桂，在行酒令时，又不免心痛起来，以酒浇愁，大醉之后，还：“圆圆，哎哟！圆圆……”叫个不休。这段描写，既细致而又简洁，的确不凡！
    我要说的话就是这些了。
    祝贺这部长篇成功！
