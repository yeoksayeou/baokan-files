In the first half of the year, the quality rate of imported raw materials and equipment inspected by the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Commodity Inspection was the lowest in recent years; the quality rate of exported goods also showed a declining trend.

From January to June, the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Commodity Inspection inspected 22,764 batches of imported and exported goods, valued at 2.8 billion yuan. Among the 661 batches of imported goods, the batch non-compliance rate reached 17%. After the inspection department issued the inspection certificate, 37 batches of non-compliant goods have been compensated, recovering losses of over 5 million yuan. The monetary non-compliance rate for exported goods inspected by the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Commodity Inspection in the first half of the year was 1.6%, which is also one of the highest in recent years.

    浙江进出口商品合格率均有下降
    据新华社杭州八月三日电　（记者林刘）上半年经浙江省商检局检验的进口的原材料、设备等，批数合格率是近几年来最低的；出口商品的合格率也呈下降趋势。
    一至六月份，浙江省商检局共检验进出口商品二万二千七百六十四批，价值二十八亿人民币。其中六百六十一批进口商品中，批数不合格率高达百分之十七。经商检部门出具商检证明后，已有三十七批不合格商品得到理赔，挽回损失五百余万元。浙江省上半年经商检局检验的出口商品中，金额不合格率为百分之一点六，也是近几年来比较高的。
