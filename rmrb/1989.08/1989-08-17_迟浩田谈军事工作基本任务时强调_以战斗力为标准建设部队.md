The Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, General Wei Zheng, emphasized today at a meeting on improving training quality and ensuring flight safety in the Air Force that in the new historical period, the PLA must adhere to the standard of combat effectiveness to build the army comprehensively.

Wei Zheng said that in the coming period, the basic task of military work throughout the army is to continue to implement the spirit of the 13th Plenary Session of the 4th Central Committee and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission last year, to focus on implementation, to unify the thoughts and actions of the entire army with the spirit of the 4th Plenary Session, to ensure that the army's construction maintains a firm and correct political direction, to ensure the Party's absolute leadership over the army, and to ensure that the fine traditions of the PLA are carried forward under new historical conditions. All work in army construction, including military work, must further adhere to the direction of combat effectiveness as the standard, without the slightest wavering, and must be resolutely and unshakably implemented and carried out.

Wei Zheng demanded that the entire army vigorously strengthen military training and improve the military and political qualities of the troops. He said that military training is the regular central work of the troops, the basic practical activity to improve combat effectiveness, and an important guarantee for the troops to fulfill their fundamental duties. In recent years, some units have shown a tendency to neglect and relax military training, which is something we must pay serious attention to.

Wei Zheng also emphasized that the army must adhere to strict military discipline. He said that the key to strict military discipline is to strictly implement various regulations, rules, and institutional norms, and to cultivate a good habit of obeying orders and prohibitions among the officers and soldiers. Strict military discipline must start with the leaders themselves. All levels of leadership must, with a high sense of responsibility for the construction of the army, start with themselves and set an example for others.

Further news: The Party Committee members of a certain aviation brigade of the Air Force stationed in Sichuan led by example in observing laws and regulations and maintaining strict military discipline, and were consecutively named as advanced units by the Air Force Party Committee for two years.

The units under this brigade have relatively good working and living conditions, and many people tried to use connections to request the brigade leaders to transfer into this unit. The Party Committee members always acted according to principles and did not accept any gifts. The unit had a sum of money that could be used to improve material living conditions, but the leaders insisted on the principle of prioritizing air operations over ground support and the troops over the headquarters. They successively built military training facilities, established agricultural and sideline production bases, and cultural venues for the troops, not only improving combat effectiveness but also significantly improving the material and cultural life of the grassroots level.

    迟浩田谈军事工作基本任务时强调
    以战斗力为标准建设部队
    新华社北京8月17日电　（记者孙茂庆）人民解放军总参谋长迟浩田上将今天在空军提高训练质量保证飞行安全工作会议上强调指出，我军在新的历史时期必须坚持以战斗力为标准，全面建设部队。
    迟浩田说，今后一个时期，全军军事工作的基本任务，就是要继续按照党的十三届四中全会和去年军委扩大会议精神，抓好落实，用四中全会的精神统一全军的思想和行动，使军队建设保持坚定正确的政治方向，保证党对军队的绝对领导，保证我军的优良传统在新的历史条件下发扬光大。军队建设的各项工作，包括军事工作，要进一步坚持以战斗力为标准的方向，不能有丝毫的动摇，要坚定不移地继续贯彻好、落实好。
    迟浩田要求全军大力加强军事训练，提高部队的军政素质。他说，军事训练是部队经常性的中心工作，是提高战斗力的基本实践活动，是履行军队根本职能的重要保证。近年来，有的部队出现了一种忽视和放松军事训练的倾向，是很值得我们重视的。
    迟浩田还强调指出，军队要坚持从严治军。他说，从严治军，关键是要严格执行各种条令、条例和规章制度，在官兵中养成一种有令则行、有禁则止的优良作风。从严治军，要坚持首先从干部自身严起，各级领导干部，都要以对军队建设的高度负责精神，从我做起，为人表率。
    又讯　驻沪空军航空兵某师党委成员带头遵纪守法，从严治军，连续两年被空军党委评为先进单位。
    这个师所属部队工作和生活条件比较好，不少人想通过说情，请求师领导照顾转入这个部队。师党委成员始终按原则办事，不接受任何馈赠。部队有一笔可用于改善物质生活条件的资金，师领导坚持先空勤后地勤、先部队后机关的原则，先后为部队修建军事训练设施，建立农副业生产基地和文化场所，不仅提高了战斗力，也使基层物质文化生活得到明显改善。　（刘柏泉　孙茂庆）
