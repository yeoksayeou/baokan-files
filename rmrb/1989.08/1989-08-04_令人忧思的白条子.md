Recently, we have heard from the public that the supply and marketing cooperatives in our county are short of funds, using white receipts to purchase wool, which has severely dampened the enthusiasm of farmers to sell their wool. As a result, 700,000 kilograms of wool are piled up unsold, and farmers are in great distress. For this reason, we visited the relevant departments in the county.

The leaders of the county supply and marketing cooperative reflected: Our county produces more than 1 million kilograms of wool annually. According to custom, by the end of June each year, the county supply and marketing cooperative has completed the wool purchase task. However, this year by the end of June, the county supply and marketing cooperative had only purchased 165,000 kilograms of wool. The main reason is that funds are severely insufficient. With no other choice, we had to use white receipts to purchase wool. The Party secretary of the county supply and marketing cooperative said: "Last year, we owed farmers 700,000 yuan in white receipts, and this has not yet been redeemed."

We also visited several grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. Some leaders said with furrowed brows: "Since we started purchasing wool, we have been surrounded by farmers demanding wool payments every day, making us frantic. Originally, we thought we could get a loan, so we issued 16 million yuan in white receipts, promising to pay within 10 days. However, the person in charge of the credit department revealed that not only is there no loan for the first half of the year, but it is also difficult to solve the problem in the second half of the year. Therefore, we can only use 10% of the daily retail sales income to pay farmers who are in real difficulty. The business of the supply and marketing cooperative has been affected and is sliding downhill."

To solve the problem of funds for purchasing wool, the county committee and government have held several meetings of the county committee standing committee and county governor's office, with everyone racking their brains to tap potential, and finally raised 9 million yuan, but this is still only 1/11 of the total purchase funds for the county. To ease the tension caused by the shortage of funds, county leaders have worn out their mouths and run around everywhere, finally securing a 2 million yuan loan from the regional agricultural bank. County leaders and colleagues in the purchasing department are anxious about the lack of money.

We saw many farmers sitting in front of the supply and marketing cooperative, with their wool still neatly bundled on carts, and farmers asking around which store can give them cash. Farmer Zhang Liang, over 60 years old, has already come to the township supply and marketing cooperative to sell wool for the fifth time. He could only exchange 25 kilograms of wool for a 250 yuan white receipt. The old man said: "For collective contracts, if you don't have money, you can pull donkeys and horses; if you can't repay the loan, the interest will roll over. But when we sell wool, we just get white receipts. Is this fair?!"

    令人忧思的白条子
    最近，我们曾听到群众反映我县供销部门资金紧缺，打白条收购羊毛，严重挫伤了农民交售羊毛的积极性，致使70万公斤羊毛积压待售，农民叫苦不迭。为此，我们走访了县有关部门。
    县供销社领导同志反映：我县年产羊毛100多万公斤。按惯例，每年6月底，县供销社就完成了羊毛收购任务；而今年截至6月底，县供销社仅收购羊毛16.5万公斤。主要原因是，资金严重不足。万般无奈，我们只好厚着脸皮用白条子收购羊毛。县供销社党委书记说：“去年，我们欠农民7万多元白条子款，至今还未兑现。”
    我们又走访了几个基层供销社。有的领导同志愁眉苦脸地说：“自从收购羊毛以来，我们每天被索要羊毛款的农民围得焦头烂额。我们原先考虑能贷到款，因此打了160万元白条子，并许愿10天后付款。谁知信贷部门负责人披露，不但上半年没有贷款，下半年也难解决。于是，我们只好拿出每天门市营业收入的10％来支付确有困难的农民。供销社的业务受到影响，出现了滑坡。”
    为解决收购羊毛的资金问题，县委和政府曾几次召开县委常委会、县长办公会，大家绞尽脑汁，挖掘潜力，才筹措了90万元，但这还不到全县收购资金的1／11。为了缓解资金短缺的矛盾，县领导人磨破了嘴，到处奔走，才从地区农行争取了20万元贷款。县领导人和收购部门的同志为缺钱心急如焚。
    我们看到了供销社门前坐着许多出售羊毛的农民，大车小车上的羊毛还原封不动地捆绑着，农民们四处打听哪家门市部能给现钱。年逾6旬的农民支亮已经是第5次到乡供销社卖羊毛了。他只好将25公斤羊毛换了一张250元的白条子。老人说：“集体收合同款，你一时没钱就拉驴拽马；贷款一时还不了就利滚利。而俺们卖羊毛就给白条子，还讲不讲道理？！”
