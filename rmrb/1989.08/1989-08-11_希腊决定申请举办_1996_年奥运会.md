Greece has decided to apply to host the 1996 Olympics. Political, economic, and other issues that have been debated for a long time have been resolved, and today, all parties in the Greek parliament unanimously voted to pass a bill to apply to host the 1996 Olympics.

The Olympic Games originated from the ancient Greek Olympics. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens in 1896. The Greek government believes that holding the Olympics in their place of origin for the 100th anniversary is a matter of national pride. Former marathon champion and parliamentarian Papayiorgoulos said that hosting the Olympics is "a need for our nation."

The parliament has decided to establish the relevant organizations to handle the application and preparation work.

    希腊决定申请举办1996年奥运会
    新华社雅典8月10日电　希腊决定申请举办1996年奥运会。为政治、经济等问题一直争论不休的希腊朝野各党，今天第一次在议会一致投票通过一项法案，决定申请举办1996年奥运会。
    奥运会起源于古希腊的奥林匹克竞技。第一届现代奥运会于1896年在雅典举行。希腊政府认为，奥运会100周年在发源地举行是希腊的光荣。曾获长跑冠军的议员帕帕约尔戈布洛斯说，举办奥运会是“我们民族的需要”。
    议会决定成立相应组织，从事申请和准备工作。
