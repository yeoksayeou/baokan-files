The six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman) are rich in oil. Oil exports account for 80-90% of the six countries' fiscal revenues. Oil is the lifeblood of these countries' economies. Even a slight fluctuation in oil prices can disrupt economic balance, and a drop of a few cents per barrel can delay the progress of a major project.

In recent years, after experiencing several significant drops in oil prices, the Gulf countries have adjusted their economic policies and accelerated the pace of economic diversification to further reduce their dependence on oil production. Establishing industries outside the oil sector is a crucial measure for the Gulf countries' economic diversification and is also their new economic strategy in anticipation of the eventual depletion of oil.

Saudi Arabia's largest industrial company, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), plans to build a number of industrial enterprises during the country's fourth five-year plan (1985-1990). Currently, Saudi Arabia has more than 2,000 factories producing over 300 types of industrial products for export. Oman plans to establish five industrial zones. The Lu'sail Industrial Zone in the capital was completed in 1984, with 37 factories producing electricity, cables, textiles, cement, and flour. By the end of this year, the industrial zone will have 13 more new factories in operation. Kuwait's non-oil industrial production growth rate has been gradually increasing, with 600 industrial projects currently in place. By 2005, the country will build six new industrial bases. Bahrain has the most diverse industrial sectors among the Gulf countries, with industries including steel, aluminum, and shipbuilding, making it the heavy industry center of the Arab world. Qatar has established many large non-oil enterprises. To address the financial difficulties of factories, many countries have established industrial banks. The UAE Industrial Bank provides low-interest loans to factories for the development of non-oil industries. The Kuwait Industrial Bank plays a prominent role in supporting non-oil industrial production.

The Gulf countries cooperate in developing various industries. The six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council hold annual meetings of their industrial ministers to formulate unified industrial development strategies and measures and discuss industrial development issues. The Gulf Cooperation Council has established the Gulf Industrial Consultative Organization to study joint investment projects among the Gulf countries. By the end of last year, the six Gulf countries had jointly invested in more than 90 projects.

In addition to various industries, the six Gulf countries place great importance on the development of agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. Saudi Arabia has transitioned from a wheat importer to an exporter, having exported wheat to the Soviet Union and China in recent years. In Oman, the past and current years have been designated as the "Year of Agriculture," with grain self-sufficiency expected soon. In Kuwait, the government has taken measures to encourage the development of agriculture and livestock. In recent years, the six Gulf countries have also focused on developing the tourism industry. These countries not only have historical sites that attract tourists but also beautiful beaches.

While diversifying their economies, the six Gulf countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE, are investing large sums of money abroad for the sake of future generations who may not see the "oil golden age." In Kuwait, there is a "Future Generations Fund" that accumulates wealth for future generations. Oil fields will eventually dry up, and the Gulf countries are preparing for their future.

    海湾经济走向多样化
    刘元培
    海湾合作委员会六国（沙特阿拉伯、科威特、巴林、卡塔尔、阿拉伯联合酋长国和阿曼）盛产石油，石油出口的收入占六国财政收入的80—90％。石油是这些国家的经济命脉，石油价格的小小浮动，就会影响经济发展的平衡，每桶油价落下几美分，就会推迟一个大工程的进度。
    近年来，在经历了几次石油价格大幅度下跌以后，海湾各国纷纷调整经济政策，加快经济多样化的步伐，进一步减少对石油生产的依赖。建立石油工业以外的其他工业，是海湾各国经济多样化的重要措施，更是它们预计未来石油会枯竭而采取的新的经济战略。
    沙特阿拉伯最大的沙皮克基础工业公司在国家第四个五年计划（1985—1990年）中将增建一批工业企业。现在，沙特阿拉伯有2000多家工厂，出口工业产品达300种。阿曼计划建立五个工业区，首都的卢萨尔工业区已于1984年建成，这个工业区中建立了发电、电缆、纺织、水泥、面粉等37个工厂，到今年年底，工业区又将有13个新工厂投产。科威特一些非石油工业生产的年增长率也逐渐提高，目前有工业项目600个。到2005年，国家新建6个工业基地。巴林是海湾各国中建立工业种类最多的国家，除石油和天然气工业外，还有钢铁、制铝、造船等工业，已成为阿拉伯国家重工业的中心。卡塔尔建成了很多非石油的大企业。为解决工厂的财经困难，不少国家建立了工业银行。阿联酋工业银行向工厂提供低息贷款，用于发展非石油工业。科威特工业银行对支持非石油工业的生产起着突出作用。
    海湾各国在发展多种工业方面进行合作，合作委员会六国的工业大臣每年举行例会，制定统一的工业发展战略和措施，商讨工业发展的问题。合作委员会设有海湾工业咨询机构，研究海湾国家联合投资项目。至去年年底，海湾六国联合投资建设的项目有90多个。
    除多种工业外，海湾六国十分重视农牧渔业的发展。沙特已从小麦进口国变成小麦出口国，近年来曾向苏联与中国出口。在阿曼，去年和今年是农业年，粮食实现自给已为期不远。在科威特，政府采取鼓励农牧业发展的措施。近年来，海湾六国还注重发展旅游业。这些国家不仅有吸引游人的名胜古迹，还有美丽的海滩。
    在经济多样化的同时，海湾六国，特别是沙特、科威特和阿联酋，为看不到“石油黄金时代”的子孙后代着想，把大量资金投放国外。在科威特，有一个“后代基金会”，为后代积累财富。油田终究要干涸，海湾各国正在为自己的未来作准备。
