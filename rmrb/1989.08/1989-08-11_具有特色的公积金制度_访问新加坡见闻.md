During our visit to Singapore, we had the opportunity to visit the Central Provident Fund Board. Manager Lim Han Siong provided us with a detailed introduction to the Provident Fund system, leaving a deep impression on us.

The Central Provident Fund system in Singapore was established in July 1955, with the initial aim of accumulating funds to address the housing needs of the people. Over the past three decades, the system has continuously developed and solidified. The cumulative Provident Fund deposits have grown from 9 million Singapore dollars (approximately 2 Singapore dollars to 1 US dollar) in 1955 to 33 billion Singapore dollars in 1988. The number of members has increased from 200,000 to 1 million. The proportion of Provident Fund contributors among the labor force and the national population has reached 78% and 36%, respectively. The Central Provident Fund has not only become a reliable social security for Singapore residents but has also become a powerful driving force for Singapore's economic development and an effective tool for government economic regulation.

Manager Lim explained that the Central Provident Fund system stipulates that all salaried employees and their employers must contribute a certain percentage of the employee's salary to the Central Provident Fund Board. The contributions from both the employee and the employer are deposited into the employee's account, with the ownership belonging to the individual. The contribution rate increases with economic growth and the improvement of workers' wage levels. In 1955, the contribution rate for both employees and employers was 5%. This rate has gradually increased, reaching a peak of 25% in 1984. Currently, the contribution rate is 23% for employees and 15% for employers. The government has specified the uses of the Provident Fund. First, it can be used for old-age insurance. After retirement, workers can use the Provident Fund as a basic living expense. Second, it can be used for financial investments. The government has formulated various investment plans, allowing members to invest within the specified range and earn profits. Third, it can be used to purchase housing. This is the original intention of implementing the Provident Fund system and is also the key to its success. As of March this year, 87% of residents have used the Provident Fund to purchase government-sold housing. Fourth, it can be used for family security insurance. Members can use the Provident Fund to insure their family homes, ensuring that in the event of the member's death or permanent disability, their family will not lose the home purchased with the Provident Fund. Fifth, it can be used for medical insurance, allowing members to use the Provident Fund in their medical accounts to pay for their own and their family's medical expenses.

In Singapore's national savings, the Provident Fund savings account for a significant portion. Dr. Tan Kwee Guan from the National University of Singapore introduced that the Provident Fund system promotes a virtuous cycle in the economy. The initial accumulation of Provident Funds was used to build port terminals, water, electricity, and gas infrastructure, laying the foundation for the later implementation of labor-intensive export-oriented industries. The development of industry promoted wage increases, which in turn led to faster growth of the Provident Fund. Additionally, the Provident Fund was used for housing construction, solving the employment of a large number of workers and promoting social stability. The Provident Fund system, by deferring current consumption to future consumption, temporarily reduces consumption pressure, avoiding the phenomenon of high economic growth accompanied by high inflation seen in some countries.

The Provident Fund system in Singapore has many unique features. The contribution to the Provident Fund is mandatory, and the contributions from both employees and employers are deposited into the individual's account. It is basically for personal use, with a lot of investment and high returns. The government does not tax the Provident Fund; it is saved first and used later, with no issues of advance withdrawal or misappropriation. The state guarantees the members' Provident Fund with overseas deposits and gold reserves.

The Provident Fund system in Singapore has been implemented for over three decades. It has promoted social stability and economic growth, and in turn, economic development has made the Provident Fund system more robust and perfect.

    具有特色的公积金制度
    ——访问新加坡见闻
    谢伏瞻
    在新加坡考察期间，我们拜访了新加坡中央公积金局，该局林汉松经理详细介绍了公积金制度，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    新加坡中央公积金制度建立于一九五五年七月，当时的目的是积累资金，解决人民的住房问题。三十多年来，公积金制度不断发展和巩固。累计公积金存款由一九五五年的九百万新元（约二新元兑一美元）增加到一九八八年的三百三十亿新元，会员由二十万增加到一百万，公积金缴交者占社会劳动者和全国人口的比重分别达到百分之七十八和百分之三十六。中央公积金不仅成为新加坡居民可靠的社会保障，也成为新加坡经济发展的强大动力、政府调控经济的有效手段。
    林经理介绍说，中央公积金制度规定，所有食薪阶层中的雇员及其雇主都必须按雇员工资的一定比例向中央公积金局缴交公积金。雇员和雇主缴交的公积金统一存入雇员的账户，所有权为雇员个人。公积金缴交率随经济增长和职工工资水平的提高而提高。一九五五年，雇员和雇主的缴交率均为百分之五，以后逐年提高，最高的一九八四年达到各百分之二十五，现在的缴交率为雇员百分之二十三，雇主百分之十五。政府对公积金规定了使用范围。第一，可以用于养老保险。当职工退休以后，可以动用公积金作为其基本的生活开销。第二，用于金融投资。政府制定了多项投资计划，允许会员在计划范围内进行投资，赚取利润。第三，购买住宅。这是实施公积金制度的动因，也是公积金制度成功之所在。截至今年三月，已有百分之八十七的居民动用公积金购买了政府出售的住宅。第四，家庭保障保险。会员动用公积金作为家庭住宅的保险后，可以保证在会员不幸去世或终生残废后其家人不失去用公积金购买的住宅。第五，医疗保险，会员可以用其医疗帐户中的公积金为自己和家人支付医疗开销。
    在新加坡的国民储蓄中，公积金储蓄占了很大的份额。新加坡国立大学的陈光贵博士介绍，公积金制度促进了经济的良性循环。初期的公积金积累用于建设港口码头、水、电、煤气等基础设施，为其后来推行出口导向的劳动密集型工业发展奠定了基础，而工业的发展促进了工资水平的提高，反过来又导致了公积金的更快增长。另外，公积金用于住宅建设，解决了大批劳动力的就业，促进了社会安定。公积金制度由于把当前消费推迟为远期消费，暂时减小了消费的压力，避免了一些国家所出现的高经济增长与高通货膨胀并存的现象。
    新加坡的公积金制度有许多特点。公积金的缴纳具有强制性，雇员与雇主缴纳的公积金均存入雇员个人账户，基本上是个人使用，投资多，收益也多，政府对公积金不收税；先存后用，不存在预支与挪用的问题，国家对会员的公积金有海外存款与黄金储备作保证。
    新加坡的公积金制度实行了三十多年，它促进了社会稳定和经济增长，同时，经济发展又使公积金制度不断巩固和完善。
