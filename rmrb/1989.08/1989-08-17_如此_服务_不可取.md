Title: Such "Service" Is Unacceptable

This spring, a certain city, during the annual sessions of the People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, had the municipal insurance company provide free personal insurance worth 5,000 yuan for each representative and committee member.

The news sparked widespread discussion among the public. Some people thought that providing safety services for the representatives and committee members during the conference, such as strengthening conference security and health services, was undoubtedly necessary, but there was no need to offer insurance during the "two sessions."

Others believed that services should be paid for, and if the representatives paid for the insurance themselves, there would be no issue. The problem lies in the fact that free personal insurance was provided. This is inappropriate. Currently, there are many "preferential" and "free" incidents: some people can buy scarce goods that others cannot; some people buy things at market prices, while others buy them at wholesale or factory prices. This reflects the socialization of non-standardized behavior, which has permeated every aspect of life.

Still, others thought that the municipal insurance company's actions, whether intentional or not, were fostering a culture that made some representatives and committee members feel "different" from the rest, forgetting that they should be "representatives of the people." This misalignment in consciousness is not conducive to establishing a "servant of the people" and "common people" mindset. Over time, the ideological and emotional gap between people's representatives and the people will widen.

Do these public opinions make sense? It is worth considering.

    如此“服务”不可取
    兴人
    今春，某市在召开一年一度的“人大”、“政协”例会期间，市保险公司免费为每位代表和委员提供五千元的人身保险金。
    消息一登出，群众议论纷纷。有人认为，为代表、委员们提供开会期间的安全服务，如加强会议保卫、保健工作等，无疑是应该的，但没有必要在“两会”期间搞什么保险。
    有人认为，服务应该是有偿的，如果代表们自己掏钱上保险，无可指摘。怪就怪在居然也搞起免费人身保险来。实属不妥。现在，“优惠”、“免费”之类的事情不少：别人买不到紧俏商品，有人能买到；别人买东西是市场价，有人买东西是批发价或出厂价……这反映了当今非规范行为的社会化，已渗透到了生活的各个方面。
    还有人认为，某市保险公司这样做正是有意或无意地助长一种风气，使一些代表、委员们产生“与众不同”的感觉，忘记了他们应是“人民”的“代表”。这种意识上的错位，是不利于树立“公仆意识”和“平民意识”的。长此以往，人民代表与人民之间的思想和感情距离会越来越大。
    群众这些看法有没有道理呢？很值得考虑。
