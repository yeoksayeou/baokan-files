In the rural areas of Southern Jiangsu, there is a steady and healthy development of moderate-scale land management from point to surface. The emergence of this new land management method signifies the deepening of rural reforms and the transition of agricultural production from traditional farming to modern agriculture.

Over the past decade of rural economic reforms, with the changes in industrial structure, millions of laborers have shifted to the secondary and tertiary industries. As a result, agricultural laborers are increasingly composed of women, children, and the elderly. Due to the significant difference in comparative benefits between farming and working or doing business, farmers' enthusiasm for agricultural production has waned, leading to part-time and secondary agricultural activities. Some long-term external procurement agents and sales agents even adopt the practice of "planting the seedlings, spraying herbicide, bowing to the field, and returning in autumn."

The reality of agricultural production in Southern Jiangsu urgently requires addressing the internal mechanisms of agriculture, changing the fragmented land management, and improving agricultural production efficiency. This will help stabilize and develop grain, cotton, and oilseed production. Starting from 1984, economically strong areas such as Yuanhe Village in Qinnan Township, Changshu City, Luyang Township, Kunshan County, and Houzhuai Township, Wuxi County have established village-run farms, family farms, and agricultural cooperatives. They have introduced agricultural mechanization facilities and equipment, promoting moderate-scale land management. Over the past two years, following the principle of "comprehensive planning, phased implementation, leading by example, and gradual progress," moderate-scale land management and agricultural mechanization trials have been steadily promoted across Southern Jiangsu. Wuxi City, which is listed by the State Council as a national rural reform experimental zone, has identified 19 pilot villages in Wuxi County and Changshu City. The city has established 35 pilot projects in six counties (cities) and one suburban district; various counties (cities) and townships have also established 50 pilot projects. The city has a total of 718 units implementing moderate-scale land management. In Southern Jiangsu, the three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou have more than 10% of the total farming households managing more than 10 mu of arable land.

Units implementing moderate-scale management have significantly improved their cultivation levels, and land output rates have steadily increased. In 1988, 54 moderate-scale management pilot units in Changshu City and Wuxi County had a total of 4,680 mu of double-crop rice and wheat fields, with an average annual yield of 654 kg per mu, an increase of 9.52% compared to the previous year, and a higher increase rate than the average increase rate in the region. This summer, various places in Suzhou City experienced a general reduction in production, but the moderate-scale management units had less reduction compared to ordinary farming households.

Moderate-scale land management has created conditions for achieving agricultural mechanization. In 35 pilot villages for moderate-scale management in Suzhou City, it has been basically achieved that "transplanting without hands, harvesting without bending, pest control without backpacks, and ditching without shovels."

Moderate-scale land management in Southern Jiangsu has also promoted the construction of the three-level agricultural service system at the county, township, and village levels, and facilitated the promotion of new varieties and new technologies.

    苏南农业向现代化迈进
    在苏南农村，正由点到面、健康稳步地发展土地适度规模经营，这种新的土地经营方式的出现，标志着农村改革深入，农业生产开始由传统农业向现代农业迈进。
    农村经济改革的十年，随着产业结构的变化，千百万劳力向二三产业转移，农业劳动者呈现妇孺化、老龄化。由于务农与做工、经商的比较效益有明显差距，农民对农业生产的积极性降低，表现出农业的业余性、兼业性，有些常年在外的采购员、经销员等，更是“黄秧一落地，撒下除草醚，向田敬个礼，秋后来还礼”。苏南农业生产的实际，迫切要求解决农业内在机制，改变土地经营的“细碎化”，提高农业生产效益，从而稳定和发展粮棉油生产。从一九八四年起，常熟市琴南乡元和村和昆山县陆杨镇、无锡县后宅乡等经济实力比较雄厚的地方，先后办起了村办农场、家庭农场和农业社，添置农业机械化设施和装备，推进土地规模经营。两年来，本着“全面规划，分步实施，以点带面，循序前进”的原则，土地规模经营和农业机械化试验在苏南大地稳步推开。苏州市被国务院列为全国农村改革试验区的吴县和常熟市，确定了十九个试点村；市在六县（市）一郊搞了三十五个试点；各县（市）、乡镇也搞了五十个试点。全市实行土地规模经营的单位已有七百一十八个。苏南苏州、无锡、常州三市经营十亩以上耕地的种田大户，已占总农户的百分之十以上。
    实行规模经营的单位，耕作水平有明显提高，土地产出率稳步增长。常熟市、吴县五十四个规模经营试点单位，一九八八年稻麦两熟田四千六百八十亩，平均年单产达六百五十四公斤，比上年增产百分之九点五二，增产幅度高于面上的平均增产幅度。今年夏熟苏州市各地普遍减产，但规模经营单位比一般农户少减产。
    土地适度规模经营为实现农业机械化创造了条件。苏州市三十五个规模经营试点村基本做到“插秧不用手，割禾不弯腰，治虫不背包，开沟不用锹”。
    苏南土地适度规模经营还带动了县、乡、村三级农业服务体系的建设，促进了新品种、新技术的推广。
