Brave Rescue of Comrades and Outsmarting Criminals
– Recounting the "Guardian of the Republic" Wang Qiang

Under a barrage of bricks, stones, and soda bottles, a convoy from a certain regiment of the martial law troops sped forward. The higher-ups had ordered them to reach Tiananmen Square by 2 AM on June 4. It was now 10 PM on June 3.

The convoy turned right onto Cuimwei Road. Suddenly, an even more intense "hail of bricks and stones" struck. The truck carrying the Fourth Company skidded and flipped over, its fuel tank scraping the ground and catching fire. Instantly, the entire vehicle was engulfed in flames, and the 38 officers and soldiers on board were trapped in the thick smoke and fire. It turned out that the driver had been struck by a flying stone and lost control of the vehicle. The regiment commander and political commissar, seeing this, shouted in unison to stop the car and organize a rescue.

"Let me stay!" With a roar, the security officer Wang Qiang pushed open the door and jumped out of the car, waving for the driver to follow the convoy with the command vehicle.

Wang Qiang used a roadside tree for cover, dodging the flying bricks and stones, and rushed to the burning truck. He helped the soldiers who had already gotten out to pull the injured one by one from the burning vehicle. As soon as the injured were pulled out, a gang of thugs incited about 200-300 people, holding bricks and stones, to surround them. They shouted, "Smash them! Smash them!" Wang Qiang, in a moment of desperation, shouted, "Scatter, the car is going to explode!" At this, the crowd dispersed like birds and beasts. Seizing the moment, Wang Qiang quickly counted the personnel and equipment with the Second Battalion Commander Dong and the officers of the Fourth Company.

The thugs, seeing that the car had not exploded, cursed and incited the crowd to throw stones, trying to close in. Wang Qiang was sweating profusely. Just then, a worker ran out from the nearby flowers and shouted to Wang Qiang, "Stop the car!" Wang Qiang took three steps and stood in the middle of the road, stopping a minivan and a small car. He loaded the 14 most seriously injured onto the vehicles. The worker volunteered to sit in the first car, taking the injured through alleys and lanes to the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army.

Wang Qiang and Commander Dong immediately organized the remaining comrades to form a circle, protecting the injured in the middle. As soon as they finished adjusting, several hundred people pressed in. Wang Qiang bit his lip, observing, and when the front row was about ten meters away, he shouted, "Watch out for the guns!" This shout caused several hundred people to flee in fear. Wang Qiang and Commander Dong took the opportunity to organize the soldiers to carry the injured and retreat into a nearby military compound.

Commander Dong found an ambulance, and Wang Qiang arranged for six lightly injured soldiers to go to the hospital. He then contacted the army headquarters stationed in the compound. The military leaders decided to form an internal security team and ordered them to retrieve the lost weapons. Wang Qiang and Commander Dong led two soldiers along the wall to Cuimwei Road, where they saw no one near the burned-out truck. They quickly jumped into the still-hot cab and retrieved two submachine guns and two handguns, then quickly retreated.

At around 5 AM the next morning, Wang Qiang reported to the military leaders and headed to Tiananmen Square to find the main force.

He borrowed a set of civilian clothes from the guard room of the compound. When he reached the Muzi Bridge, he pretended to be a bystander and blended into the crowd on the west side of the bridge. After a while, the onlookers gradually dispersed, and Wang Qiang gave a signal to a nearby injured soldier who could still walk. Then, with all his might, he suddenly picked up a soldier who had been knocked unconscious and ran forward. The other four injured soldiers also stood up, supporting each other as they followed him. The nearby thugs noticed someone rescuing the injured and shouted, "Leave the soldiers behind! Leave the soldiers behind!" At this critical moment, a gate appeared not far ahead, with two armed police officers standing at the entrance. Wang Qiang rushed into the compound, and the other four injured soldiers also entered the compound.

To rescue the injured on the street, Wang Qiang entered the office building of the unit, knocking on the door of the office marked "Security Department." Inside were two comrades, one was Comrade Liu, the director, and the other was Comrade Wang, the security officer.

The three agreed on a rescue plan and saved 58 injured officers and soldiers.

Wang Qiang had just stepped out when he saw a young man with a "Hong Kong haircut" waving a submachine gun. Wang Qiang wanted to seize it but saw that there were many onlookers, so he changed his mind.

The man had just turned into a small alley, and Wang Qiang quickly caught up, "Halt, I am from the public security bureau, put down the gun!" The man was intimidated by Wang Qiang's demeanor, put down the gun, and slipped away.

In less than an hour, Wang Qiang had retrieved another submachine gun. Then, with the help of the security officers of a certain unit, he retrieved 8 submachine guns, 2 handguns, and 10 boxes of ammunition.

The phone in the security department of a certain unit rang urgently again. The gatekeeper at the west gate reported: 69 soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army were besieged outside the gate in a bicycle shed.

It started to get dark and rain. The besieging crowd retreated to a distance to avoid the rain. Wang Qiang seized the opportunity and had the security officers open the west gate. He then organized 69 officers and soldiers to retreat into a garage 200 meters inside the west gate.

At around 2 AM on June 6, Wang Qiang, dressed in civilian clothes, led the team out of the compound. After walking through the alleys for less than 10 minutes, they met up with the troops sent by the military museum to escort them. At 5 AM, 69 officers and soldiers safely entered the military museum compound.

It was dawn, and Wang Qiang, facing the morning sun, walked towards the Tiananmen Square he longed for!

    勇救战友智斗歹徒
    ——记“共和国卫士”　王强
    郑健　李茂
    顶着一阵阵暴雨般袭来的砖头、石块、汽水瓶，戒严部队某团的车队疾速开进。上级命令他们6月4日凌晨2时前抵达天安门广场，随后参加清场。此时是3日晚10时。
    车队向右拐了个弯儿，行至翠微路。突然，一场更猛烈的“砖石雨”袭来了。四连乘坐的卡车“嘎”地翻倒在地，油箱擦地骤然起火。顿时，整个车体被火焰包围，车上的38名干部战士被笼罩在浓烟烈火中。原来，司机被飞来的石块砸昏，汽车失去控制。坐在后面指挥车上的团长、政委见状，异口同声地命令停车，争着下去组织抢救。
    “让我留下！”随着一声大吼，前座上的保卫干事王强推开车门，飞身下车，随即挥手让司机驾驶指挥车，跟上车队。
    王强以行道树做掩护，躲避着飞来的砖头、石块，跑到燃烧的卡车旁，帮助已下车的战友把伤员一个个扶出燃烧的车厢。伤员们刚被救出，一伙歹徒煽动二三百人，手里举着砖头、石块，从四周围上来了。他们喊着：“砸死他们！砸死他们！”王强急中生智，忽地亮开嗓门：“快散开，车要爆炸了！”这一喊，围上来的人呼啦如鸟兽散。利用这时机，王强急忙和搭乘这车的二营董营长及四连的干部，清点了人员和装备。
    歹徒见汽车没爆炸，叫骂着煽动群众扔石头，试探着围了上来。王强急得浑身冒汗。就在这时，路旁的花丛中跑出一位工人，冲着王强喊：“快拦汽车！”王强三步并两步，跨到马路中间，拦住了一辆面包车和一辆小轿车，让伤情较重的14名伤员上了车。这位工人还自告奋勇，坐上第一辆车，过小巷，绕胡同，把伤员带往解放军总医院。
    王强和董营长立即组织剩下的同志围成圈，把负伤的同志护在中间。刚调整完毕，数百人逼上来了。王强咬着嘴唇，观察着，待前面的人走到十来米远时，他又一声吼：“注意手中的枪！”经这一吼，几百人吓得逃开了。王强和董营长乘机组织战士们架着负伤的同志，撤进了附近部队机关一座大院。
    董营长找来救护车，王强安排6名轻伤员去医院，然后又与设在本院的集团军指挥部取得了联系。军首长决定将他们编成军部内卫队，同时要他们将失散的枪支找回。王强和董营长带领两名战士沿着墙脚，来到翠微路口，看到被烧毁的卡车旁无人，便迅速跳进早已烧得发烫的驾驶室，从里面取出了两支冲锋枪、两支手枪，很快撤了回来。
    第二天凌晨5时左右，王强向军首长汇报后，前往天安门寻找大部队。
    他向大院警卫室借来了一套便服穿上。他来到木樨地桥头时，装出围观的样子，挤进桥西头的人群里。过了一阵子，围观的人逐渐散开了，王强向旁边还能走路的受伤战士递了个眼色，然后使出全身的劲，忽地背起一个被打昏在地的战士向前跑去。其他4名伤员也陡然站起来，互相搀扶着跟他跑。附近的暴徒们发现有人救伤员，喊叫起来：“把当兵的留下！把当兵的留下！”在这千钧一发之际，前面不远处出现一道铁门，门口站着两位武警战士。王强使劲冲进院内，其他4名受伤的战士也进了大院。
    为了抢救大街上的伤员，王强走进了这个单位的办公大楼，敲开了挂着“保卫处”牌子的办公室。里面坐着两位同志，一位是刘处长，一位是王干事。
    3人商定了抢救的办法，救回了58名受伤的干部战士。
    王强刚出门，正见一个留“香港头”的年轻人舞弄一支冲锋枪。王强想上前收缴，一看围观的人不少，便改变了主意。
    那人刚拐进一个小胡同，王强几步赶上去：“站住，我是公安局的，把枪放下！”那人被王强的气势镇住了，放下枪灰溜溜地走了。
    不到一小时的功夫，王强又夺回了一支冲锋枪。接着，他在某单位保卫处同志的帮助下，又收回了8支冲锋枪、2支手枪和10箱子弹。
    某单位保卫处电话铃又急促地响起来了。大院西门门卫报告：69名解放军指战员被围困在门外的自行车棚里。
    天渐渐黑下来了，下起雨来了。围阻的人纷纷退到远处避雨去了。王强抓住时机，让保卫处的同志把西门打开，他则和干部们组织69名干部、战士一下子退进了西门内200米处的一个车库。
    6日凌晨两点钟左右，穿便服的王强在队伍前20多米处带路，这支队伍离开了某单位大院。沿着胡同走出不到10分钟，就和军博派来接应的部队汇合了。5点钟，69名干部战士全部安全地进入军博大院。
    天亮了，王强迎着朝霞，向着他思念的天安门广场走去！
