    The Forbidden City Faces Greater Worries
    On May 10, the sixth edition of your newspaper published a reporter's investigation titled "The Forbidden City's Worries," which highlighted many issues concerning the Forbidden City, drawing significant attention. In addition to what was mentioned in the reporter's investigation, the Forbidden City currently faces four even more pressing concerns.

    First, there is the issue of "destructive opening." In recent years, the number of visitors to the Forbidden City has surged, putting the site in an overloaded state. This has made the preservation of ancient architecture, ancient trees, and other cultural relics within the Forbidden City extremely challenging. If this situation is not addressed promptly, the Forbidden City may be irreparably damaged in a few years or decades.

    Second, there is the problem of relocating external units occupying the Forbidden City. Currently, 10 units still occupy some of the halls and other buildings within the Forbidden City. As long as they do not relocate, the Forbidden City cannot be comprehensively managed and effectively protected as a whole; the open areas cannot be expanded, and the destructive opening cannot be further alleviated.

    Third, there is the issue of defining the scope of cultural relic protection for the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City, along with the surrounding buildings, waterways, and trees, forms a unified whole. Currently, this complete system has been divided into several independent units, each operating on its own. Therefore, the current protection of the Forbidden City is fragmented.

    Fourth, there is the conflict between the management, display of collections, and the protection of the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City houses nearly a million precious cultural relics from various dynasties. These collections need to be preserved and displayed, which requires storage rooms and exhibition halls, and ideally, the introduction of modern facilities. However, the Forbidden City cannot construct new buildings, and the palace buildings cannot be arbitrarily modified. This creates a conflict between the ancient architectural relics and the collection relics. For many years, this conflict has weighed heavily on the minds of the Forbidden City's staff.

    Currently, the Forbidden City Museum is experiencing a new peak in development, and the conflicts have become even more pronounced. The Forbidden City needs societal supervision, guidance from all sectors, and the support and assistance of everyone. It also needs the understanding of the public.

### 故宫还有更大的忧患

    故宫还有更大的忧患
    5月10日你报第六版登载了记者信访调查《故宫忧患录》谈到故宫许多问题，引人注意。除了记者信访调查所说的，故宫目前还存有4个更大的忧患。
    首先是“破坏性开放”问题。近几年来，故宫观众激增，使故宫处于超负载状态，对故宫的古建筑、古树等文物的保护工作造成很大困难。这种局面不及时改变，几年或几十年之后，故宫将面目全非。
    其次是占用故宫的外单位搬迁问题。目前，有10家单位仍占用故宫的一些殿堂和其它建筑。他们不迁走，故宫就不能完整地得到统一管理和有效保护；开放区就扩大不了，破坏性开放也难以进一步缓解。
    第三是故宫文物保护范围的确定问题。故宫与周围的建筑、河道、树木是一个统一的整体。目前，这个完整体系被分割为互不相干的若干单位，各自为政。因此，现在故宫的保护是抱残守缺。
    第四是藏品文物的保管、陈列与故宫保护的矛盾。故宫收藏了历代珍贵文物近100万件。这些藏品文物要保护，要展出，就需要库房、展厅，而且最好能引进现代化设施。但故宫不能建设新的建筑，宫殿建筑又不能任意改造。这就造成了古建文物与藏品文物的矛盾。多少年来，这种矛盾缠绕着故宫职工的心。
    现在，故宫博物院发展出现新的高峰，矛盾愈加突出。故宫需要社会监督，需要各界的指导，更需要大家的支持、帮助，也需要人们的理解。
