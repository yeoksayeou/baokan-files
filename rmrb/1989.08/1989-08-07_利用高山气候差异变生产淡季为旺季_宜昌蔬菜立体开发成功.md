	“No fresh vegetables, pickled vegetables will do”—the difficulty in obtaining vegetables during the spring and autumn off-seasons has long been a problem for many cities in China. What is the solution? Yichang City in Hubei Province has found a way through vertical vegetable development. During the off-season, vegetables are abundant, with an average daily supply of 0.53 kilograms of fresh vegetables per person, basically solving the problem of citizens struggling to obtain vegetables. On August 4th, a panel of 13 vegetable experts from the province evaluated Yichang City's multi-level vertical vegetable development project. The experts unanimously agreed that this achievement has universal significance and can be promoted.

	Since 1986, Yichang City has prioritized solving the vegetable shortage as a key task for public welfare. They established a vertical vegetable development strategy that focuses on suburban areas, radiates to neighboring counties, and spans from low to high altitudes. The Municipal Science and Technology Commission organized researchers to investigate and verify the climate and soil conditions of the Jianghan Plain and the Qingjiang River Valley in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, overcoming this challenge. In 1987, the city utilized the altitude differences of 800 to 1,800 meters in the semi-high mountain and high mountain areas of Leyuan and Huoshao Town in Longyang County to build a 5,000-acre vertical vegetable development base, creating a massive natural vegetable cold storage for the city. This year, the problem of citizens struggling to obtain vegetables during the spring and autumn off-seasons was solved. During this year's spring off-season, the city's daily per capita supply of fresh vegetables ranked first among the eight major cities in the province.

	Vertical vegetable development not only solved the problem of citizens struggling to obtain vegetables during the off-season but also supported cities like Wuhan. Over the past three years, the city has supplied Wuhan with over 5 million kilograms of fresh vegetables annually. Currently, as the autumn off-season approaches, the fresh vegetables from the "natural cold storage" are being continuously delivered to citizens' tables.

    利用高山气候差异变生产淡季为旺季
    宜昌蔬菜立体开发成功
    本报武汉8月7日电　“没鲜菜，腌菜代”——蔬菜春秋生产淡季市民吃菜难，已成为我国不少城市的难题。出路何在？湖北省宜昌市闯出蔬菜立体开发的路子，淡季瓜菜飘香，人均日供应鲜菜0.53公斤，基本解决了市民吃菜难。8月4日，由省内13位蔬菜专家组成的评委会，对宜昌市多层次蔬菜立体开发项目进行了鉴定。专家们一致认为，该成果具有普遍意义，可以推广。
    1986年以来，宜昌市把解决吃菜难当作为民办实事的头等大事来抓，确立了立足郊区、辐射邻县、由低海拔到高海拔的立体蔬菜开发战略。市科委组织科研人员，对长江中游河谷清江河谷的气候土壤等进行了考察论证，攻克了这一课题。1987年，这个市利用长阳县乐园、火烧坪乡海拔800米—1800米的半高山、高山立体气候差异，建成蔬菜立体开发基地5000亩，成为全市巨大的鲜菜天然冰库，当年就解决了春秋生产淡季市民吃菜难。今年春淡时节，全市鲜菜人均日供应量名列全省八个大中城市之首。
    蔬菜立体开发不仅解决了该市淡季市民吃菜难，而且支援了武汉等城市。近三年来，这个市每年支援武汉市的鲜菜都在500万公斤以上。目前已进入秋淡，“天然冰库”的鲜菜正源源不断地送到市民的餐桌上。　（胡学军　胡兴国）
