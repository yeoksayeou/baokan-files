Recently, I read Xia Yan's article "In Memory of the Artistic Giant Ouyang Yujian's 100th Birthday," and saw the words before the title, "He has made pioneering and reforming contributions in the fields of drama, opera, film, dance, and education." This made me think of Ouyang Laoyuan, who was also a passionate supporter of the music industry. Because I worked with him during the War of Resistance in Guilin, I have deep feelings about this.

During the War of Resistance, due to Ouyang Yujian's prestige in the cultural world, the authorities invited him to establish the Guangxi Provincial Art Museum, which was founded in March 1940, with him as the director.

At that time, I was in Nanjing with a few young people forming a chamber music ensemble (piano quintet). Introduced by the painter Xu Beihong, we went to Guilin to "promote music education." But apart from holding a few concerts, we did not know how to develop our work. Ouyang Yujian's Art Museum had a music department. He invited me, as well as a cellist Wang Youjian (brother-in-law of Ma Sicong), a clarinet player and composer Wang Yiping (now a professor at Wuhan Conservatory of Music), and two violinists, Chen Xin (who later went to Southeast Asia) and Li Min (who died during the Cultural Revolution), to be "research fellows." This is how I came to know Ouyang Yujian. "What are we supposed to research?" I asked Director Ouyang. His eyes, peering through his high-powered glasses, looked at me and he smiled, "You don't need to research anything, just do your music." We were overjoyed. This was exactly the kind of work we were looking for. True musicians are never lazy. The less you impose rigid rules and the less you dictate from on high, the more they will strive to improve their skills and work hard. Ouyang Yujian, being an artist himself, understood the principles of leading artists.

Ouyang Yujian dared to support us, who seemed to be taking money without doing work (not going to the office). I admire this very much. He knew that people like us would not be idle unless they really couldn't do anything. Those who can't do anything are as good as not doing anything at all.

By 1942, Ouyang Yujian asked me to take over as the head of the Art Museum's music department. At that time, the music department had developed significantly, with a professional choir of 20 people and a professional orchestra of 15 people. I was responsible for arranging and conducting. We had a group of professional singers. As long as you practiced singing, participated in choir rehearsals, and performed (not very often), you would receive your monthly salary. The orchestra had only 4 first violins, 3 second violins, 1 viola, 2 cellos, 1 double bass, 1 flute, 1 clarinet, 1 percussion, and 1 piano, which could only be considered a "mini" orchestra. Apart from playing solo instrumental works, they also accompanied the choir, and they were very good at it. Under his leadership, the music department had a lot of autonomy and independence. He greatly respected the special rules of music art and never forced us to serve the work of the drama department he led.

In 1946, I was already working in Nanchang. At that time, I had composed the entire score for the opera "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" and held a special concert of selected arias in Nanchang. I had written to Ouyang Yujian at that time, asking if we could rehearse and perform this opera in Guilin? He replied with a very enthusiastic letter, saying we could try to find a way. Later, he wrote another letter saying that to perform such an opera, we needed a silk curtain to create a sense of ethereality and mystery, heaven and earth, but the Art Museum's funds were very tight, making it difficult to purchase one. Later, I received another letter from Ouyang Yujian, informing me that due to being excluded by local evil forces, he was preparing to leave Guilin. Indeed, he left Guilin in September of that year. With this, my opera's performance also became completely hopeless.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a considerable number of music workers returned from Hong Kong at Ouyang Yujian's invitation, including the Zhang Yan couple, Chen Xuan couple, Wang Lian San, Tang Min Nan, and I was one of them.

Ouyang Yujian passed away in 1962. At that time, I was in Wuhan and wanted to express my condolences, but hesitated to write, fearing that it would burden the bereaved family. Because in 1957, I was unwillingly drawn into the "expanded" movement. Now, by writing this short article to commemorate the old director, I can finally express Ouyang Yujian's support for China's music industry during the War of Resistance, and this will also settle an old matter in my heart.

    欧阳予倩和音乐
    陆华柏
    最近，读夏衍同志《纪念艺术大师欧阳予倩百岁诞辰》一文，看到题前的“他在话剧、戏曲、电影、舞蹈、教育等多方面的领域都有开创之功、改革之功”这番话，便想起欧阳老也是音乐事业热心的扶植者，因为我抗战时期在桂林与他共过事，所以深有感受。
    抗战时期，由于欧阳予倩在文化界的声望，当局请他筹建广西省艺术馆，并于1940年3月成立，任他为馆长。
    当时我在南京与几个青年人结为室乐演奏小组（钢琴五重奏），得画家徐悲鸿介绍到桂林“推广音乐教育”。但我们除了举行过几场音乐会之外，就不知道怎样开展工作了。欧阳予倩主办的艺术馆设有音乐部。他邀请我，还有一个拉大提琴的王友健（马思聪的妻弟）、一个吹单簧管兼作曲的王义平（现为武汉音乐学院教授），还有两位拉小提琴的陈欣（后去南洋）和黎珉（文革中去世）当“研究员”。我也就是这样与欧阳予倩相识的。“我们研究什么呢？”我问欧阳馆长。他的眼睛透过高度近视镜片望望我笑了笑说：“什么都不要你们研究，就是搞你们的音乐。”我们高兴极了，我们就是想找这样的工作。真正学音乐的人是不会懒的，你越不作硬性规定，越不居高临下指手划脚，他们越会自己努力练技巧、努力工作。欧阳予倩正因为是艺术家，所以深谙领导艺术家的规律。
    欧阳予倩敢于养着我们这些平常看起来似乎拿钱不做事（不上班）的人，这一点我很佩服。他深知：我们这样的人是不会不做事的，除非真的不行，那种人就是做了也等于不做。
    到了1942年，欧阳予倩要我担任艺术馆音乐部的主任。这时音乐部已有了相当大的发展，拥有一个编制为20人的职业性合唱团，一个15人的职业性管弦乐队。我是编谱兼常任指挥。养着一批专业歌唱家，只要你自己练唱、参加合唱排练、参加演出（次数也并不多），每月照发薪金。管弦乐队只有第一小提琴4人、第二小提琴3人、中提琴1人、大提琴2人、低音提琴1人、长笛1人、单簧管1人、打击乐1人、钢琴1人，只能算个“微型”乐队。除单独演奏器乐作品外，平常还为合唱团伴奏，也是很出色的。在他领导下，音乐部的工作有很大的主动权和独立性，他十分尊重音乐艺术的特殊规律，从不强迫我们为他领导的戏剧部门的工作服务。
    1946年，我已到南昌工作。那时我曾将歌剧《牛郎织女》脚本全部谱出曲，并在南昌举行过一次专场的选曲清唱音乐会。我当时曾与欧阳予倩通信，问他能否在桂林排练演出此歌剧？他复了很热情的信，说可以想办法。后来他又来一信，说上演这样的歌剧，必须要有一纱幕，才能显得飘缈朦胧，天上人间，但是艺术馆经费十分拮据，难以购置。后来，又接到欧阳予倩的信，他告诉我，由于受到地方恶势排斥，他准备离开桂林，这一年9月间他真的离开了桂林。至此，我这部歌剧的演出也就完全绝望了。
    1949年中华人民共和国成立后，我们有相当一批音乐工作者都是应欧阳予倩之邀从香港回来的，包括章彦夫妇、陈玄夫妇、王连三、唐敏南等等，我也是其中之一。
    欧阳予倩是1962年去世的，当时我在武汉，想表示一点悼唁之情，提笔又犹豫了，怕累及丧家，因为我在1957年身不由己被卷入了“扩大”之中。现在写出这篇纪念老馆长的短文，一吐欧阳先生在抗战时期对我国音乐事业的支持，也算了结一桩心事了。
