Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 9th.

Guangdong's public security organs have, by the end of July, shut down 38 sauna massage parlors that were poorly managed and had severe public security issues. Over 180 sauna massage parlors that offered mixed-gender massages have either ceased operations or voluntarily stopped their services, with 24 of them switching to same-gender massages. Additionally, a number of female massage workers from other provinces have been dismissed and sent back.

According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, by June of this year, Guangdong Province had over 270 sauna massage parlors. Many of these parlors, in pursuit of excessive profits, attracted customers through mixed-gender massages, and some even became places of filth and debauchery.

Last November and this May, the Guangdong Provincial Government issued two notices, requiring local authorities to strengthen the rectification and management of the sauna massage industry. For parlors with significant issues and strong public complaints, a thorough rectification and cleanup were to be conducted. Those that had degenerated into venues for sexual misconduct were to be shut down.

It is understood that over 240 sauna massage parlors across the province have undergone thorough rectification and cleanup. The number of female massage workers from other provinces who have been dismissed and sent back accounts for 83% of the total number that should be sent back.

    粤全面整顿桑拿按摩业
    新华社广州8月9日电　（通讯员晓珠、记者吕毅子）广东省公安机关到7月底，已取缔38间管理混乱、治安问题严重的桑拿按摩室；180多间搞异性按摩的桑拿按摩室已经停业或自动停办，有24间改为同性按摩。同时还清退遣返了一批外省女按摩员。
    据有关部门不完全统计，到今年6月，广东省已有桑拿按摩室270多间。不少桑拿按摩室为获取暴利，以异性按摩招徕顾客，有的甚至变成了藏污纳垢、色情淫乱的场所。
    去年11月和今年5月间，广东省人民政府两次发出通知，要求各地切实加强对桑拿按摩行业的整治和管理，对问题较多、群众反映大的桑拿按摩室坚决进行整顿和清理工作，对那些已沦为色情场所的桑拿按摩室，坚决取缔。
    据了解，全省已有240多间桑拿按摩室进行了彻底的清理整治，清退遣返的外省女按摩员占应遣返总数的83％。
