To ensure the smooth progress of socialist modernization, deepen reforms comprehensively, and strengthen anti-corruption efforts, it is crucial to leverage the role of auditing, one of the state's inspection and supervision mechanisms. To better fulfill the supervisory functions of auditing, summarize the practical experiences of China's auditing work, and explore the theory of China's auditing work, Xiong Hanxiang and Liu Lin edited the book "Comprehensive Practical Auditing," which was recently published by Dadi Publishing House.

This book, compared to several other auditing-related books already published in China, has the characteristic of being more comprehensive in content. It covers almost all aspects of auditing knowledge, including auditing history, auditing foundations, auditing procedures, auditing classifications, auditing methods, auditing regulations, and various specialized auditing fields such as finance, taxation, administrative affairs, basic construction, finance, foreign investment, industrial enterprises, commercial enterprises, and more. In addition to domestic auditing knowledge, it also briefly introduces the general situation of foreign auditing. The book is divided into eight major categories, with 1247 entries and over 1.2 million words, making it the most systematic and complete large-scale reference book in China's auditing field. It provides valuable insights for auditing professionals, practical economic workers, and teaching and research personnel to comprehensively understand the situation of auditing work and master the basic knowledge of auditing work.

This book provides a profound explanation of the basic knowledge of auditing and incorporates research results from both domestic and international sources. For example, regarding the explanation of the concept of auditing, this book has made progress compared to "Cihai" and "Concise Britannica." It states: "Auditing is conducted by specialized auditing agencies set up by the state or auditing consulting agencies approved and registered by relevant government departments. Based on accounting records and related economic data, it examines the implementation of financial and economic discipline by the audited unit and the economic benefits, and communicates the audit conclusions or decisions to the audited unit and its supervisory departments, prompting the audited unit to strengthen economic management, prevent errors and malpractices, and achieve the goal of improving economic benefits. It is an important component of economic management." This summary is derived from China's auditing practice. It is not limited to enterprise units nor is it limited to examining accounting books and statements. Its functions and tasks are broader, thus having its own characteristics. These entries on the basic knowledge of auditing provide valuable teaching materials for those who are learning auditing and self-studying auditing, as well as for auditing professionals.

Another feature of this book is its timeliness. It incorporates new theoretical and practical research results on auditing from recent years, explaining new situations, new categories, and new concepts that have emerged during the reform and opening up. With the reform of China's financial system, off-budget funds have significantly increased. This reform is meaningful in mobilizing the enthusiasm of local and departmental entities, but it has also brought about many problems, with a relative decrease in central budget funds. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the management and auditing supervision of off-budget funds. The "Off-Budget Funds Auditing" entry in this book provides a specialized explanation of the relevant auditing system. Regarding individual income tax, the book also provides a detailed discussion, proposing auditing inspection and supervision requirements, thereby increasing national tax revenue, preventing individual tax evasion, and avoiding social inequity in distribution. Continuing to improve governance and reform, adhering to the principles of reform and opening up, and resolutely combating corruption are tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party. In accomplishing these tasks, auditing plays a very important role. The book has compiled many entries related to this aspect. For example, regarding the necessity and role of auditing in the current stage, the relationship between reform and opening up and auditing, and auditing of embezzlement, bribery, theft, fraud, private division, speculation, dereliction of duty, etc., there are entries for discussion, and both general and detailed discussions. For instance, there are 85 entries on financial auditing, over 100 entries on tax auditing, and over 140 entries on construction auditing, etc.

   《实用审计大全》评介

    保证社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行，全面深化改革，加强廉政建设，要大力发挥国家检查监督机制之一的审计作用。为了更好地履行审计的监督职能，总结我国审计工作的实践经验，探索我国审计工作的理论，熊汉祥、刘麟主编了《实用审计大全》一书，最近由大地出版社出版。
    这部书，同目前我国已经出版的几本有关审计的书相比，具有内容比较全面的特色。它囊括了几乎所有审计知识的范围，包括审计史、审计基础、审计程序、审计分类、审计方法、审计法规，以及分门别类的各专业审计，例如财政、税收、行政事业、基本建设、金融、外资、工业企业、商业企业诸方面的审计等。除国内审计知识外，它还扼要地介绍了外国审计概况。本书共分八大类，1247个词条，120多万字，是目前我国审计领域最为系统、完整的一部大型工具书。它对专业审计工作者、实际经济工作者和教学研究人员全面地了解审计工作的情况，掌握审计工作的基础知识是有启迪的。
    这部书，对审计基础知识作了比较深刻的阐释，吸收了国内外的研究成果。例如，关于审计这个概念的解释，该书就比《辞海》和《简明不列颠百科全书》前进了一步。它指出：“审计是由国家专门设置的审计机关或经政府有关部门批准、注册的审计咨询机构，依据会计记录和有关经济资料，对被审计单位财政收支或财务收支的财经法纪执行情况及经济效益情况进行审核和稽查，并将审计结论或决定通知给被审计单位及其主管部门，促使被审计单位加强经济管理，防止差错和弊端，达到提高经济效益目的的一种经济监督活动，它是经济管理的重要组成部分。”这个概括是从我国审计工作实践中得出来的。它不局限于企业单位，也不局限于查核会计帐簿、报表。它的职能任务比较广泛，因而具有自己的特色。这些审计基础知识方面的词条，为初学审计学和自学审计学的同志以及审计工作者提供了有价值的教材。
    这部书还有一个特点，就是新。它吸收了近年来关于审计的理论实践研究的新成果，解释了在改革开放中出现的一些新情况、新范畴和新观念。随着我国财政体制的改革，预算外资金大量增加。这项改革对调动地方和部门的积极性是有意义的，但也出现了许多问题，中央财政预算资金相对减少。因此，迫切需要加强对预算外资金的管理和审计监督。本书的“预算外资金审计”词条，对有关审计制度进行了专门的阐述。对于个人所得税，本书也作了比较详细的论述，提出了审计检查监督的要求，从而达到增加国家税收、防止个人偷税漏税、避免社会分配不公的目的。继续搞好治理整顿，更好地坚持改革开放，坚决惩治腐败，是党的十三届四中全会提出的任务。在完成这些任务中，审计担负着极为重要的责任。本书编辑了许多有关这个方面的词条。像关于现阶段审计的必要性和作用，关于改革开放与审计，关于对贪污、行贿受贿、盗窃、诈骗、私分、投机倒把、玩忽职守的审计等，都有论述的词条，而且既有概论，又有细论。如关于财政审计列有85个条目，税务审计有100多个条目，基本建设审计有140多个条目等。
