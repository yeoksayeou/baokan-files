Shanghai will begin trial collection of miscellaneous fees in elementary and middle schools starting this autumn. The city will also adjust fees for high schools and collect tuition and miscellaneous fees for new students enrolled in local ordinary colleges under the state plan. All fees collected by various schools will be used to supplement the school's public funds deficit and cannot be used for teachers' welfare or bonuses.

Shanghai's fee standards and methods are as follows: For elementary schools, 10 yuan per student per semester will be collected as miscellaneous fees, with tuition fees waived; for middle schools, 20 yuan per student per semester will be collected as miscellaneous fees, with tuition fees waived; for general high schools (including vocational high schools), 20 yuan per student per semester will be collected as miscellaneous fees, and 10 yuan as tuition fees; for key high schools at the municipal, district, and county levels, 30 yuan per student per semester will be collected as miscellaneous fees, and 20 yuan as tuition fees. For new students enrolled in ordinary colleges under the state plan, 200 yuan will be collected annually as tuition and miscellaneous fees. Students in rural and normal schools will be exempt from paying tuition and miscellaneous fees.
