The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in the Soviet Union's Azerbaijan is experiencing its fourth month of strikes due to ethnic tensions. Clashes between local ethnic groups are frequent. Authorities are taking measures to maintain public order.

According to reports, extremists from both the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities have been attacking and sabotaging cars and trains, leading to multiple disruptions in transportation. Residents live in a climate of fear. Extremists are even calling for the establishment of a new government and open armed struggle.

Food, seeds, feed, medicine, and fuel needed by the local area are all supplied from the central government and other regions, with over 1,000 trucks escorted by internal security forces.

Clashes between the Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis in the autonomous oblast's capital began last September. The Soviet authorities immediately declared a curfew in the capital and other areas. Since the beginning of this year, the situation in these places has been relatively calm, but since May, conflicts between the two ethnic groups have intensified, and strikes have occurred in some factories and enterprises.

Local authorities and leaders of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs are taking further measures to stop subversive activities and clashes, and to ensure the safety of residents.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Moscow on August 15, the editorial of *Pravda* on August 15 emphasized that every Communist Party member should firmly draw a line with those who oppose socialist national unity and disrupt the situation.

The editorial, titled "Stopping Negative Trends, Defending Reform," criticizes the informal organizations People's Front in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia for deviating from reform under the influence of extremists, demanding absolute economic autonomy and "national independence," separating from the Soviet Union, and adhering to a narrow nationalist stance.

    苏联纳—卡州正采取措施制止民族矛盾引起的动乱
    《真理报》文章反对狭隘民族主义
    新华社莫斯科8月14日电  据塔斯社报道，苏联阿塞拜疆的纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫自治州因民族矛盾而引起的罢工已进入第4个月。当地民族之间的械斗频繁。当局正采取措施维护社会治安。
    据报道，亚美尼亚族和阿塞拜疆族的极端分子不断袭击和颠覆汽车和火车，交通线多次被切断。居民生活在恐怖气氛中。极端分子甚至号召另立政权和公开搞武装斗争。
    当地需要的食品、种子、饲料、药品和燃料全由中央和其他地方调入，由内务部部队护送1000多辆汽车运去。
    信基督教的亚美尼亚人和信伊斯兰教的阿塞拜疆人在该自治州首府在去年9月开始发生械斗。苏联当局随即宣布在该州首府等地实行宵禁。从今年年初起，这些地方局势相对平静，但今年5月以来，两族冲突又趋激烈，一些工厂企业里发生了罢工。
    地方当局和苏联内务部领导正采取进一步的措施制止颠覆活动和械斗，保证居民的人身安全。
    据新华社莫斯科8月15日电　《真理报》15日在谈到波罗的海沿岸的民族问题时强调指出，每个共产党员都应同反对社会主义民族团结和扰乱局势的人坚决划清界线。
    这篇题为《制止不良进程，保卫改革》的编辑部文章，批评拉脱维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚的非正式组织人民阵线在极端分子影响下，背离改革，要求绝对经济自主和“国家独立”，脱离苏联，坚持狭隘民族主义的立场。
