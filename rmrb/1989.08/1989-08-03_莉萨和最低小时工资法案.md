Just after 7 a.m., Lisa, a temporary worker at a small grocery and bar in the suburbs of Knoxville, Tennessee, starts sweeping and washing the tiled floor. Soon after, she begins serving coffee and pastries to customers. She has been doing this for four months.

Lisa is a young woman, only 20 years old. This is her first temporary job. Like 3.9 million out of the 6 million hourly wage earners in the United States, Lisa receives the lowest hourly wage. The current minimum hourly wage in the United States is $3.35, but her employer only pays her $3 per hour, claiming this is legal because the difference can be made up with tips.

In May of this year, the U.S. Congress passed a bill to gradually increase the minimum hourly wage. According to this bill, by 1991, excluding a 60-day apprenticeship period, the minimum hourly wage should reach $4.55. However, on June 13, President Bush vetoed this bill. As a result, Lisa, along with nearly 4 million street sweepers, toilet cleaners, gardeners, and dishwashers in restaurants, will not see a wage increase.

At $3.35 per hour and 30 hours per week, Lisa's monthly net income is $402. Lisa took this job out of necessity. She originally wanted to go to school and become a secretary, but an unexpected pregnancy disrupted her plans. She cannot afford to support little Thomas, so she relies on part-time work and a little help from her retired father to support herself and her child.

Lisa's situation is quite representative of the lowest-income earners in the United States. These people are mainly concentrated in the southern and midwestern regions with the highest unemployment rates, where 65% are women and 60% are under 25 years old. Marion Edidman, chairman of the National Children's Defense Fund, said that Bush's decision particularly harms the interests of women and minority races.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Labor said that among those receiving the minimum hourly wage, two-thirds are voluntarily engaged in part-time work. In fact, employers often limit the number of hours each employee works per week to avoid paying medical insurance. They prefer to hire two part-time workers rather than one full-time worker. Moreover, in non-technical service industries, employees can easily be replaced, so there is no shortage of workers. As a result, these workers, who are the most exploited, cannot afford to get sick. Lisa sighed, "I can't even imagine what would happen if I broke a leg or if my child got sick. Just one visit to a pediatrician costs $40, let alone the cost of medication."

Indeed, most minimum wage earners do not stay at this level for long; they either leave to find other jobs or are promoted to higher-paying positions. However, 3.4% of the labor force in the United States remains at this level. Since 1981, the minimum hourly wage has not increased by a single cent. During the Reagan era, the purchasing power of this group of people decreased by about 40%. Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO, angrily said that to just offset inflation, the minimum hourly wage today should be $4.60, and by 1992, it should reach $5.50.

On the issue of the minimum wage bill, the Democratic-controlled Congress had its first dispute with the Republican administration of Bush. In his veto message, Bush said, "Passing this bill will result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs," and "such an excessive increase will not help poor workers." A Department of Labor spokesperson said, "Only 8.6% of minimum wage earners are the heads of households living below the federal poverty line, and in fact, there are not many people living on the minimum wage." Democrats dismissed this as "ridiculous." They said that a large number of minimum wage earners are actually single parents. The White House is prepared to accept a plan to raise the minimum hourly wage to $4.25, provided that employers can pay less during a six-month training period. The AFL-CIO pointed out, "The excuse of training is a lie. These temporary jobs do not require any special skills."

After Bush vetoed the congressional proposal, Democrats tried to gather two-thirds of the votes in Congress to override Bush's veto, but they failed. Perhaps during the fall session of Congress, both sides will reach a compromise on this issue. For now, Lisa can only continue to receive the minimum hourly wage of $3.35, which is just enough for her to finish a day's work and eat a beef sandwich with a cup of cola.

    莉萨和最低小时工资法案
    张祝基
    早晨刚7点钟，在田纳西州诺克斯维尔郊区一家食品杂货兼酒吧小店当临时工的莉萨，便开始清扫和洗刷方瓷砖地板，稍后，她就给顾客们端咖啡、送小面包。她受雇4个月来，天天如此。
    莉萨是个年轻姑娘，今年才20岁。这是她找到的头一份临时性工作。如同全美国600万领小时工资者中的390万人一样，莉萨拿的也是最低一档的小时工资。美国现行最低小时工资是3.35美元，但她的老板只付她每小时3美元，说这完全合法，因为其差额被认为可由小费收入来补足。
    今年5月，美国国会通过了一项逐步增加最低小时工资的法案。按这项法案的规定，到1991年，除去规定的60天学徒期，最低小时工资应达到4.55美元。可是，6月13日布什总统对这项法案行使了否决权。这样一来，莉萨就同人数近400万的扫街的、扫厕所的、修剪园林的、在餐馆洗盘子的人一样，不能涨工资了。
    每小时3.35美元，每周30小时，莉萨每月的净收入是402美元。莉萨打这种工确实是不得已而作出的选择。她本来想上学，毕业后当秘书，但是意外的怀孕打乱了她的计划，她供养不起小托马斯，只能靠打短工及退休父亲的一点贴补来维持娘儿俩的生计。
    莉萨的情况在美国最低收入者当中有相当的代表性。这批人主要分布在失业率最高的南方和中西部地区，其中妇女占65％，年龄不足25岁的达60％。全美儿童保护基金会主席马里恩·埃迪曼说，布什的决定尤其严重打击了妇女和少数种族的利益。
    美国劳工部发言人称，在领取最低小时工资者中，有2／3是自愿从事非全天性工作的。事实上，一般都是雇主限制每个雇工的周劳动小时，以逃避对其雇工支付医疗保险。他们宁愿雇两个半日工也不愿用一个全日工。再说，在那些非技术性的服务行业，雇工是可以互相调换的，不愁雇不到人。结果就造成这些无产者中受剥削最重的人生不起病。莉萨就叹息道：“我真不敢想象如果我断了一条腿或是孩子生了病会怎么样，找小儿科医生光看一次病就得40美元，还别说按方抓药。”
    确实，大多数领最低工资者停留在这个档次上的时间并不长，他们或出走另图生计，或晋升到较高的档次上。但是，在全美国劳动队伍当中始终有3.4％的人处于这个水平。从1981年以来，最低小时工资没涨过1美分。在里根时代，这部分人的购买力下降了40％左右。美国劳联—产联主席拉恩·柯兰德气愤地说，单是为抵消通货膨胀，今天的最低小时工资就应为4.6美元，而到1992年则应达到5.5美元。
    在最低小时工资法案上，民主党占多数的议会同布什的共和党政府发生了第一起争端。布什在否决议会这项提案的文稿中说，“通过这项法案会造成损失几十万个就业机会”，“这种过分的增加将不会使贫穷的劳动者得到什么帮助”。劳工部一位发言人说，“只有8.6％的最低工资收入者是处于联帮规定的贫困线以下家庭的户主，事实上依靠最低工资过活的人并不多。”对这种说法，民主党斥之为“滑稽可笑”。他们说，恰恰有非常多的最低工资收入者是单亲家庭的户主。白宫准备接受的方案是将最低小时工资提高到4.25美元，条件是雇主可以在6个月的培训期里支付得更少些。劳联—产联指出：“培训的借口是骗人的，这种临时性的工作正是不需要什么技术专长的。”
    布什否决了议会提案以后，民主党人曾极力征集议会中2／3多数票以废除布什的否决，但没有成功。也许今秋议会开会期间，双方会就此问题达成一项妥协。但在目前，莉萨仍然只能继续领取每小时3.35美元的最低工资，这仅够她干完一天的活吃一份牛肉饼三明治加一杯可乐。
