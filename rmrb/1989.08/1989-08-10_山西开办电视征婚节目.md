Xinhua News Agency reports that more and more people seeking marriage partners are coming to the Shanxi Provincial Television Station. The "Television Matchmaking" program, which began in July of last year, has already featured over 600 men and women looking for spouses on the television screen. The majority of the matchmakers are farmers, but there are also a significant number of workers, teachers, cadres, and disabled individuals. The first person to appear on the television station for matchmaking was Yinqi Haolin, an individual transportation business owner from Xinzhou City in Shanxi. At 28 years old, Yinqi Haolin previously had difficulty finding a partner. The "Television Matchmaking" program changed his situation, and a young woman from 300 kilometers away eventually became his partner.

    山西开办电视征婚节目
    据新华社电　山西有越来越多的征婚者走进省电视台的大门。
    这里举办的“电视征婚”节目从去年7月开始，已经让600多名寻求配偶的男女在电视屏幕上“亮相”。征婚者以农民居多，工人、教师、干部和残疾人比例也不少。第一个登上电视台征婚的，是山西忻州市个体运输专业户邢海林。28岁的邢海林过去找对象难，“电视征婚”改变了他的窘境，300公里之外的一位姑娘终于成了他的伴侣。
