Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 19th — Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, China has made significant achievements in urban greening. By the end of 1988, more than 400 cities across the country had a total of 52,000 hectares of public green space, with an average of 3.3 square meters of public green space per capita, meeting the planned targets for the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The average green coverage rate in urban areas was 17%.

These impressive statistics were revealed for the first time at the National Key Cities Greening Work Conference held in Changchun today by the National Greening Commission.

In the past, urban greening in China mainly relied on professional teams from the horticulture department. After the National People's Congress passed the resolution to carry out nationwide voluntary tree-planting in 1981, citizens enthusiastically participated in greening construction, accelerating the pace of urban greening. Statistics show that by 1988, the total area of urban horticulture and greening had increased to 308,000 hectares. There were 76 cities with a green coverage rate of 20% to 30%, and 41 cities with a green coverage rate exceeding 30%.

The National Key Cities Greening Work Conference noted that urban greening construction in China is still imbalanced, and there are many weak links in greening management. Incidents of encroaching on garden green spaces and indiscriminate felling of trees frequently occur.

    人均公共绿地逾三平方米
    四百余城市绿化达标
    新华社长春8月19日电　（记者范向群）改革开放10年来，我国城市绿化取得了很大成绩。1988年底，全国400多个城市拥有公共绿地面积5.2万公顷，人均公共绿地面积3.3平方米，已经达到“七五”的规划指标；市区的平均绿化覆盖率为17％。
    这些令人注目的统计数字，是全国绿化委员会今天在长春召开的全国重点城市绿化工作会议上，首次披露的。
    我国城市绿化过去主要依靠园林部门的专业队伍。1981年全国人大通过开展全民义务植树的决议以后，广大市民积极投入绿化建设，加快了城市绿化的步伐。据统计，1988年全国城市的园林绿化面积已增加到30.8万公顷，有76个城市绿化覆盖率达到20％—30％，有41个城市绿化覆盖率超过了30％。
    全国重点城市绿化工作会议认为，我国城市绿化建设还很不平衡，绿化的管理工作存在不少薄弱环节，侵占园林绿地、乱砍滥伐树木的现象屡有发生。
