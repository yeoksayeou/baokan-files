Last month, while traveling, I heard a mayor say that in recent years, when it comes to solving funding issues, everyone tends to focus on asking for money. Enterprises ask banks for money, and banks ask the state for money. However, there is little effort put into studying how to use and manage money effectively. Recently, I reviewed several documents and reflected on the mayor's words, finding them particularly insightful.

First, in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, there are six wool textile enterprises. After the wool market was liberalized last year, each factory rushed to purchase wool, fearing they would be at a disadvantage if they acted too slowly. As a result, wool inventory exceeded capacity, and almost all liquid funds were tied up, with over 100 million yuan in various raw material funds still outstanding. The factory directors are in a state of despair.

Second, at the beginning of this year, seven or eight enterprises in Dalian and Anshan were entangled in a "triangular debt" situation. Enterprises needing steel materials had no money to buy them, Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan Steel) had no money to pay for equipment purchases, and enterprises selling smelting equipment were waiting for Anshan Steel to pay their cooperative factories. Approximately 700 to 800 million yuan in funds were stuck in a chain, with no one able to move.

The factory directors are in a difficult situation because the funds that should be circulating are stuck. The reason for this stagnation is the improper use and poor management of funds. Money and goods can be converted into each other; a wise businessperson knows how to turn static goods into liquid, usable funds. However, many enterprise managers, on one hand, are running around asking for funds, while on the other hand, their warehouses are filled with products, and their workshops are cluttered with semi-finished goods. Once the "triangular debt" knot is untied, it could release tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of yuan in funds.

The consequences of not putting effort into the use and management of funds are often worse than anticipated. It not only leads to a vicious cycle of asking for money, losing funds, stagnation, asking for money again, and further loss and stagnation, but also causes macroeconomic imbalances due to micro-level mismanagement, leading to overall economic disorder.

Using money wisely and managing it strictly is the key to good financial management. However, during the long period of a planned economy, enterprises were accustomed to the "big pot" system of state allocation, naturally strengthening the mindset of asking for money. Methods, channels, and tricks for asking for and competing over money emerged in abundance, while the awareness and skills for using and managing money effectively weakened and declined. Thus, in the face of the development of a commodity economy, some enterprises inevitably find themselves at a loss and in awkward situations. However, if handled well, these problems can turn into opportunities. Under the current pressure of tight funds, many enterprise managers have realized that asking for money is not a good strategy. Since this spring, the Dalian municipal government has taken the lead, with the Economic Commission, banks, and enterprises working together to tap potential, clear debts, and plug loopholes, successfully reviving tens of billions of yuan in funds. This is a successful example.

To ease the tight fund environment, the central bank needs to firmly implement the policy of "controlling the total amount, adjusting the structure, ensuring key areas, compressing general areas, supporting the strong and restricting the weak, and timely adjustment." However, if local governments, specialized banks, and enterprises all take action, focusing on the rational use and strict management of funds, and work together, it is possible to achieve twice the results with half the effort.

### 伸手要钱非上策

    伸手要钱非上策
    路华
    上月外出，听到一位市长说，近年来在解决资金问题上，大家总把眼睛盯在要钱上。企业向银行要钱，银行向国家要钱。但如何用好钱，管好钱，很少下功夫研究。最近看了几份材料，回想这位市长的话，感觉格外深刻。
    一是内蒙古呼和浩特市有6家毛纺企业，于去年羊毛经营放开以后，各厂纷纷争购羊毛，唯恐动作慢了吃亏。结果羊毛库存超量，几乎所有的活钱被压死，至今拖欠各种原材料资金总额达1亿元以上。厂长叫苦不迭。
    二是今年初，大连和鞍山市七八家企业陷入“三角债”的纠葛之中，需要钢材的企业没钱买，有钢材的鞍钢没钱偿付买设备的款，卖出冶炼设备的企业又等鞍钢的钱还给协作厂，七八千万元资金，似连环扣一样，谁也动弹不得。
    厂长们苦，苦在本该运动的资金眼巴巴被压死。而压死的原因是资金使用上的不当和管理上的疏漏。钱和物本可互相转换的，精明的企业家善于把不动的物变成流动可用的资金；而今许多企业经营者一方面四处奔走要资金，另一方面他们的库房里却堆满了产品，各车间摆满了半成品；“三角债”中的死结一旦解开，也能解救出数千万甚至上亿元资金。
    在使用和管理资金上不下功夫造成的恶果，往往比预料的大。不仅会引发出要钱——资金流失、沉淀——再要钱——资金再流失、再沉淀的恶性循环，还会由于微观的失控又引起宏观上的资金供求失调，造成整个经济活动的紊乱。
    合理花钱，严格管理，是当家理财的要诀。但在长期的产品经济时期，企业吃国家统收统支的“大锅饭”，伸手要钱的意识很自然地强化起来，要钱、争钱的相应办法、门路、高招层出不穷，而用好钱、管好钱的意识和本领相对弱化、衰退。于是，在商品经济发展的风浪中，有些企业难免手足无措，窘态百出。不过，处理得好，坏事也能变成好事。在当今资金紧张的压力下，已使许多企业的经营者悟出了一个道理：伸手要钱非上策。今春以来，大连市政府牵头，经委、银行、企业协同挖潜、清理欠款、堵塞漏洞，一举把十几亿元资金复活了。这是个成功的例子。
    让资金紧张的环境宽松，当然中央银行需要坚决贯彻“控制总量，调整结构，保证重点，压缩一般，扶优限劣，及时调节”的方针，然而，如各地方、专业银行、企业都动作起来，在合理用钱，严格管理上下功夫，上下齐心协力，那就有可能收到事半功倍的效果。
