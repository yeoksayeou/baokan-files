The ancient city of Rome boasts a rich culture and a long history, but it also faces numerous serious social issues. One of the most prominent is the "army of vagrants" that can be seen throughout the city center.

According to a survey by the Italian Social Policy Research Center, there are 2,000 vagrants in the central district of Rome alone. They wander the streets and sleep on scraps of paper, with most of them aged between 45 and 50. Among them, 1,500 are so-called "necessary vagrants," driven to vagrancy by life's hardships, while the other 500 are "voluntary vagrants" who view vagrancy as a "romantic" lifestyle.

To alleviate the problem of vagrants in the city center, the Rome municipal government allocated 60 billion lire (approximately $4.5 million) to assist with their food and shelter. For example, the government rented a house near the central train station to establish a shelter. Over the past two years, the shelter has accommodated a total of 2,939 vagrants. On average, 60 male vagrants and 36 female vagrants stay there each night. Each room has four beds. The shelter opens at 5 PM daily to provide dinner for the vagrants, and closes after breakfast the next morning. Vagrants can take care of their personal hygiene here, and 30 medical staff members provide healthcare services. Clearly, these measures taken by the Rome municipal government are insufficient to solve the problem of vagrancy.

    罗马街头的流浪者

    古城罗马有灿烂的文化、悠久的历史，但也存在不少严重的社会问题。市中心举目可见的
  “流浪者大军”便是其中之一。
    据意大利社会政策研究中心调查，仅在罗马市中心区就有2000名流浪者。他们徘徊在街头路边，睡在破纸片中，年龄多在45到50岁之间。其中1500名是所谓“出于需要的流浪者”，即为生活所迫而成为流浪者，另500名则是所谓“出于自愿选择的流浪者”，他们视流浪生活为“浪漫”。
    为缓解市中心的流浪者大军问题，罗马市政府曾拨款60亿里拉（约合450万美元），用于帮助解决流浪者的食宿。例如它在市中心火车站租下一所房子，开设了一个收容所，两年来共收容接待2939名流浪者。每天晚上平均有60个流浪汉、36个流浪女来住宿。每间房子4个床位。每天下午5时开门为流浪者提供晚饭，次日早饭后关门，流浪者在这里可以搞搞个人卫生，并有30名医护人员为流浪者提供医疗服务。显然，罗马市政府采取的这些措施是不可能解决流浪者这个社会问题的。
