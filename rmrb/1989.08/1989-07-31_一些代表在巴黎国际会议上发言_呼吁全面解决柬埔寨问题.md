Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 31st.

Some representatives at the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue spoke yesterday afternoon, calling for a comprehensive resolution to the Cambodian problem. Following the opening ceremony, the conference held a plenary session where some delegates presented their views on the Cambodian issue.

Singapore's Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam, in his speech, exposed Vietnam's tactics in announcing its withdrawal of troops, stating that Vietnam had never kept its promises in the past 40 years. Vietnam chose to withdraw troops by the end of September to avoid further condemnation at the upcoming UN General Assembly. The so-called Cambodian problem is essentially a result of Vietnam's invasion, and only by completely eradicating the remnants of Vietnamese colonialism can the problem be solved, not just by withdrawing troops. The argument that Cambodians should resolve their "internal problems" is unacceptable. We have a duty to help the Cambodian people achieve national reconciliation and genuine autonomy. A temporary coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk must be formed, with free elections to be held under international supervision.

Brunei's Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed Bolkiah proposed two key issues for resolving the Cambodian problem: first, establishing a strong international supervision mechanism, led by the United Nations, to oversee Vietnam's troop withdrawal; second, comprehensively resolving the Cambodian problem, including internal issues.

Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark pointed out that the Cambodian problem should be resolved comprehensively, including both internal and external issues. Internal and external issues are interrelated, and separating them will only bring more bloodshed and regional instability.

U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, in his speech, believed that the path to resolving the Cambodian problem is long but has already taken the first steps. Only a comprehensive solution is the best choice. Any solution must be comprehensive; otherwise, the war will only prolong and lead to tomorrow's civil war.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze stated that the time has come to resolve the Cambodian problem, and external conditions are ripe. The core of resolving the Cambodian problem is to take measures to prevent the possibility of civil war, to formulate specific ceasefire agreements among all parties, and to stop providing military aid to the conflicting parties. He called for the establishment of a stronger international supervision mechanism to oversee and inspect the withdrawal of foreign troops.

UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, in his speech, stated that the world cannot be indifferent to the war in Cambodia. The goal of this conference is to end this destructive war. He said the conference will also discuss the issue of international supervision. He emphasized that any international supervision must have the full cooperation of all relevant parties and should not be imposed on them.

The "Prime Minister" of the Phnom Penh government, Hun Sen, also spoke at the conference. He denied that the root of the Cambodian problem was Vietnam's invasion, instead blaming the "Khmer Rouge." He believed that the Cambodian problem has two aspects: first, the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, and second, preventing the return of the "Khmer Rouge." The first issue will be resolved by September, leaving the second issue to be addressed.

Today is the second day of the conference, and the speeches by the delegates will continue.

### 一些代表在巴黎国际会议上发言  呼吁全面解决柬埔寨问题

    一些代表在巴黎国际会议上发言
    呼吁全面解决柬埔寨问题
    本报巴黎7月31日电　记者吕网大、张启华报道，昨日下午，柬埔寨问题国际会议在开幕仪式后进行了大会发言。依据大会安排，部分与会代表在大会上阐述了各自关于柬埔寨问题的立场。
    新加坡外长黄根成在发言中揭露越南宣布撤军的手腕时说，40年来越南从未遵守过他的诺言。越南选择9月底撤军，是想避免今年在联大会议上再次受到谴责。所谓柬埔寨问题，实质上是越南入侵造成的，只有全部消除越南殖民主义痕迹之后，才能解决这个问题，而不仅仅是撤军。所谓让柬埔寨人解决“内部问题”的论点是坚决不能接受的，我们有义务帮助柬埔寨人民实现民族和解和真正的自治，必须组成由西哈努克领导的四方临时联合政府，在国际监督下实行自由选择。
    文莱外交大臣穆罕默德·博尔基亚在发言中提出解决柬埔寨问题的两个关键问题：一是针对越南撤军，应建立强有力的、由联合国主持的国际监督机构；二是全面解决柬埔寨问题，包括内部问题。
    加拿大外交部长乔·克拉克指出，应该全面解决柬埔寨问题（包括内部、外部问题）。内部与外部问题是相辅相成的，分开解决带给人民的是流血、地区不稳定。
    美国国务卿贝克在发言中认为，解决柬埔寨问题的道路虽然是漫长的，但已走上了开头的几步。只有全面解决的办法才是最好的选择，任何一个解决办法应该是全面的，否则战争只会持久并导致明天的内战。
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在发言中说，柬埔寨问题已到了解决的时候，外部条件已经成熟。解决柬埔寨问题的核心，首先要制定出措施，制止发生内战的可能性，制定出具体的各方停火协议及停止向冲突各方提供军援。他呼吁建立更有力的国际监督机构，以监督和检查外国军队的撤退。
    联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔在讲话中表示，不能对柬埔寨的战争无动于衷，这次会议的目标是要结束这场毁灭性的战争。他说，这次会议还要讨论国际监督问题。他表示任何国际监督不能缺少有关各方的完全的配合，同时在任何情况下也不强加于它们。
    金边政权“总理”洪森也在会上发了言。他否认柬埔寨问题的根源是越南的入侵，反而说根源是“红色高棉”。他认为，柬埔寨问题有两个方面，一是越南撤军，二是防止“红色高棉”重返。现在，第一个问题将于9月解决，剩下的是第二个问题。
    今天是大会的第二天，与会代表的发言继续进行。
