In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, Shandong, with the strong support of the state, has completed a large number of key engineering projects. Starting in the 1950s, the first alumina plant in the country, Shandong Aluminum Plant, began construction, marking the start of Shandong's key engineering projects. In the 1960s and 1970s, the province organized key engineering campaigns, concentrating efforts to build a number of key projects in steel, chemical, and mechanical industries that filled gaps, laying a solid material foundation for Shandong's comprehensive economic development. During the 10 years of reform and opening up, the people of Shandong have spared no effort to complete a series of key engineering projects related to the revitalization of the national economy, such as energy and transportation.

In early 1964, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to organize an oil campaign in Dongying, Shandong. Tens of thousands of oil workers endured hardships and worked day and night. After 25 years of arduous struggle, they built the world-renowned second Daqing—the Shengli Oilfield in the vast wilderness. The state invested over 6.2 billion yuan to build the 300,000-ton ethylene project in Qilu, which has become one of the important bases for large-scale petrochemicals in the country. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the ports of Qingdao and Yantai have been expanded, and the ports of Shitou and Huangdao Oil Port have been newly built. The famous Shitou Port has built the largest deep-water berth coal wharf in the country, becoming an advanced and modernized port with a high degree of automation.

In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, with the support of the state, Shandong has completed and put into operation 297 large and medium-sized projects and single-item engineering projects. This has increased the province's fixed assets by 60 billion yuan. The increased coal mining capacity is 40.85 million tons, the crude oil mining capacity is 39.77 million tons, the installed capacity of power generation is 6.98 million kilowatts, and the newly built mainline railway track mileage is 811 kilometers.

After the completion and operation of these key projects, the industrial, enterprise, and product structures have been improved, forming an industrial system with relatively complete categories, advanced technology and equipment, and coordinated development. They have made due contributions in supporting the country and earning foreign exchange.

    蓬勃发展的山东重点建设
    凤阳　怀清　庆海
    建国40年来，山东在国家的大力支援下，建成一大批重点工程项目。从50年代开始，全国第一个氧化铝厂——山东铝厂开工建设，揭开了山东重点工程建设的战幕。60和70年代，全省组织了重点工程大会战，集中力量建设了一批钢铁、化工、机械等填补空白的重点项目，为山东经济的全面发展奠定坚实的物质基础。改革开放10年间，山东人民全力以赴相继建成一批关系全国经济振兴的能源、交通等重点工程项目。
    1964年初，党中央决定在山东东营组织石油大会战，上万名石油大军风餐露宿，昼夜奋战，经过25年艰苦创业，在茫茫荒原上建起了举世闻名的第二个大庆——胜利油田。国家投资62亿多元建成的齐鲁30万吨乙烯工程，成为全国大型石油化工的重要基地之一。十一届三中全会以来，先后扩建了青岛、烟台港，新建了石臼港和黄岛油港。闻名遐迩的石臼港，建成我国最大深水泊位的煤码头，成为自动化程度较高、技术先进的现代化港口。
    建国40年来，在国家支援下，山东共有297个大中型项目和单项工程建成投产。使全省新增固定资产600亿元。新增煤炭开采能力4085万吨，原油开采能力3977万吨，发电装机容量698万千瓦，新建铁路正线铺轨里程811公里。
    一批批重点工程建成投产后，改善了产业、企业和产品的结构，形成一个门类较齐全、技术设备先进、协调发展的工业体系，在支援全国和出口创汇方面做出了应有的贡献。
