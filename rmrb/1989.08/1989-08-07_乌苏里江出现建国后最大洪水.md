The Ussuri River, which forms part of the border between China and the Soviet Union, has experienced the largest flood since the founding of the nation. From August 4 to 6, the water level at the Houtou Station in Hulin County exceeded the previous highest level recorded in 1971 by 8 to 19 centimeters, reaching 54.61 meters. The water level continues to rise.

This flood has caused significant damage to 680,000 mu (approximately 45,333 hectares) of farmland in Hulin County, with 104,000 mu (approximately 6,922 hectares) completely destroyed. Five townships, two state-owned farms, and more than 20 villages have been affected, with some houses collapsing.

The Hulin County Party Committee and government have organized over 200 cadres to the front lines of flood control and disaster relief. They have mobilized personnel, vehicles, and supplies to assist and guide the affected areas. Currently, the elderly, sick, disabled, women, and children in the affected regions have all been evacuated to safe areas. It is understood that this flood was primarily caused by heavy rainfall in the upper reaches of the Ussuri River in recent days.

    乌苏里江出现建国后最大洪水
    新华社哈尔滨8月7日电  （记者张广远）中苏界江乌苏里江近日发生建国以来最大洪水。4日至6日，虎林县虎头站水位比建国后最高水位1971年的54.61米高8至19厘米。目前水位仍在上涨。
    这次洪水使虎林县68万亩农田遭洪涝灾害，其中绝产面积10.4万亩，5个乡镇、2个国营农牧场、20多个村屯受灾，有少量房屋倒塌。
    虎林县委、县政府现已组织200多名干部深入抗洪救灾第一线，调动人员、车辆、物资，帮助指导抗灾。目前受灾地区老弱病残和妇女儿童已全部转移到安全地带。据了解，这次洪水主要是乌苏里江上游地区近日连降暴雨所致。
