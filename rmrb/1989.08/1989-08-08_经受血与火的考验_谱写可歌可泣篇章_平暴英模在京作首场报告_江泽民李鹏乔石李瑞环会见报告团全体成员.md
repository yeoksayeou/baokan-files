Despite having his right eyeball struck by a flying stone, he still rescued a wounded soldier and, with unyielding willpower, rushed to Tiananmen Square. Li Lin, the deputy political commissar of the Fifth Detachment of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police, introduced how 50 riot control personnel opened 26 major intersections and 21 minor intersections for the advance of the martial law vanguard.

Wang Renzhi, the Minister of Propaganda, made the final speech. He called on everyone to take the models as examples, learn from the models' firm stance of loyalty to the Party, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to socialism, distinguish right from wrong, expose and criticize the conspiracy of a few people against the Party and against socialism, and at the same time, correctly distinguish and handle two different types of contradictions.

He emphasized that learning from the models means learning their revolutionary spirit of fearlessness in the face of risks, fearlessness of sacrifice, righteousness, and dedication, and doing a good job in their own duties on their respective posts.
