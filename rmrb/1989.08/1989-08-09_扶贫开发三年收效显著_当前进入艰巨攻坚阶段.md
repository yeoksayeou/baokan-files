Poverty alleviation and development work in China has focused on helping solve the problem of basic subsistence for the people in poverty-stricken areas over the past three years, achieving significant results. According to the latest statistics from relevant state departments, 679 counties supported by the state and various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions had an average per capita net income of 333.1 yuan for farmers in 1988, an increase of 35.5% from 245.9 yuan in 1985. After adjusting for price changes, the increase was 14.2%. This marks the beginning of the most arduous phase in poverty alleviation and development work.

According to joint statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics and the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas under the State Council, in all poverty-stricken counties, about half had an average per capita net income growth rate over the three years that exceeded the national average growth rate of 37%, with 38 counties seeing their per capita net income double or more. By the end of 1988, the number of rural residents in poverty-stricken counties with a per capita net income of less than 200 yuan had decreased from 64.54 million in 1985 to 22.565 million, a reduction of 65%, and their proportion of the rural population in poverty-stricken counties had decreased from 39.5% to 9.9%.

Statistical data also show that the number of poverty-stricken counties with a per capita net income of less than 200 yuan has significantly decreased nationwide. In 1985, out of the 679 poverty-stricken counties nationwide, 224 had a per capita net income of less than 200 yuan, accounting for 33% of the total number of poverty-stricken counties. By 1988, this number had decreased to 70 counties. Meanwhile, the number of poverty-stricken counties with a per capita net income of more than 200 yuan nationwide increased to 609, accounting for 89.7% of the total number of poverty-stricken counties. Among these, 56 counties had a per capita income of more than 500 yuan, accounting for 8.2% of the total number of poverty-stricken counties.

Although economic development in poverty-stricken areas has achieved significant results, the task remains arduous. A member of the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas under the State Council said that, if calculated based on comparable prices in 1985, there are still 195 counties and 57.885 million people nationwide with an average per capita net income of less than 200 yuan. Moreover, the remaining population that has not yet solved the problem of basic subsistence is mainly concentrated in areas with harsh natural conditions, low levels of social development, minority regions, reservoir areas, deep mountain areas, disaster-prone areas, and areas with difficulties in water supply for humans and livestock, making support more challenging. To achieve victory in the decisive battle of poverty alleviation, leaders at all levels and in all regions need to make more arduous and long-term efforts.

    扶贫开发三年收效显著  当前进入艰巨攻坚阶段
    据新华社北京8月9日电　（记者蒲立业）我国扶贫开发工作，近3年以帮助解决贫困地区群众温饱问题为重头，取得显著效果。据国家主管部门最新统计，国家和各省、市、自治区扶持的679个贫困县，1988年农民人均纯收入为333.1元，比1985年的245.9元增长35.5％，扣除物价变动因素，增长14.2％。至此，扶贫开发工作已开始进入最艰巨的攻坚战阶段。
    据国家统计局和国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组联合统计，在全部贫困县中，有一半左右的县农民3年人均纯收入增长速度，超过全国平均增长37％的水平，其中有38个县人均纯收入翻了一番以上。到1988年底，全国贫困县中人均纯收入200元以下的乡村人口，已从1985年的6454万人减少到2256.5万人，下降65％，占全国贫困县乡村人口的比重从39.5％下降到9.9％。
    统计资料同时表明，全国人均纯收入200元以下的贫困县明显减少。1985年，全国679个贫困县中，人均纯收入200元以下的县有224个，占全国贫困县总数的33％，到1988年，已减少到70个县。与此同时，1988年全国人均纯收入200元以上的贫困县增加到609个，占全国贫困县总数的89.7％，其中，人均收入达到500元以上的贫困县为56个，占贫困县总数的8.2％。
    贫困地区经济开发尽管已取得显著效果，但任务仍十分艰巨。国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组一位同志说，如果以1985年可比价格计算，目前全国农村仍有195个县、5788.5万人年均纯收入水平低于200元。而且，目前剩下的尚未解决温饱的贫困人口，主要集中在自然条件恶劣、社会发育程度较低的少数民族地区、库区、深山区、多灾区和人畜饮水困难地区，扶持难度相当大。要夺取扶贫工作的攻坚战胜利，各级各地领导还需经过更为艰难的长期努力。
