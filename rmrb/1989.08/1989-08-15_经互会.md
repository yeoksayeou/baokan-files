The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, commonly known as Comecon, was established in Moscow in January 1949. Initially, it had six member countries: Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. In February 1949, Albania joined the organization (later withdrawing in 1961), and in September 1950, East Germany became a member. Starting in the 1960s, Comecon successively admitted Mongolia (June 1962), Cuba (July 1972), and Vietnam (June 1978), thereby expanding beyond the European continent to become an international economic organization spanning Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The headquarters of Comecon is in Moscow. Its purpose is to engage in economic mutual assistance, technological cooperation, exchange of experiences, and promotion of economic development among member countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Yugoslavia, Laos, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Angola participate in Comecon's regular meetings as observers.

    经互会
    经济互助委员会简称经互会，于一九四九年一月在莫斯科成立。当时有六个成员国：保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克。一九四九年二月，阿尔巴尼亚加入了该组织（后于一九六一年退出），一九五○年九月，民主德国加入了该组织。从六十年代起，经互会先后接纳了蒙古（一九六二年六月）、古巴（一九七二年七月）和越南（一九七八年六月），从而超出了欧洲大陆的范围，成了一个横跨欧、亚、美三大洲的国际性经济组织。经互会总部设在莫斯科，其宗旨是在平等互利基础上进行经济互助、技术合作、交流经验、促进各会员国的经济发展。南斯拉夫、老挝、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、安哥拉以观察员身份参加经互会的例行会议。
