This time in Tongxiang, Zhejiang, I was accompanying family members to visit the former residence of Feng Zikai, known as Yuan Yuan Tang. Upon arrival, friends unanimously recommended a place called West Gate, saying it was a must-see.

West Gate is a location in Wuzhen, Tongxiang. It is a narrow, long street. It is said that the street has a long history and was already prosperous during the Tang Dynasty. After many vicissitudes, the existing buildings were constructed during the late Qing and early Republican periods but retain the architectural style of the Song and Ming dynasties. Along the street, there are two-story buildings closely adjacent to each other. The eaves and railings are intricately carved and arranged in a harmonious manner. The street is very narrow, much like the description in "The Lin Family Shop," where shopkeepers on either side can converse with each other. The street is famous for a unique "bridge within a bridge" scenic spot. At the junction of two rivers, two bridges were built from different directions. From the arch of the larger bridge, one can see the smaller bridge. The larger bridge is called Tongji, also known as the West Gate Bridge; the smaller bridge is called Renji, also known as the West Gate Bridge, both rebuilt during the Ming Dynasty's Zhengde period. Seeing one bridge through the arch of another is not uncommon, but the unique position of the West Gate Bridge creates a distinctive and appealing landscape, making it a popular attraction.

In today's era of rapid modernization and urban renewal, it is surprising that Tongxiang has managed to preserve an entire old street like West Gate. Honestly, preserving such an old street is not easy. Firstly, new high-rise buildings are often seen as a significant achievement in urban development and a goal for local officials. The value of preserving old streets and buildings is easily overlooked. Secondly, local residents might wonder why they should continue living in old houses while others move into new apartments. These two factors often make it difficult to preserve old streets. The fact that Tongxiang has managed to do so is commendable.

I recall visiting Yantai's Yangma Island a couple of years ago, where I saw a thatched-roof courtyard house amidst modern buildings. It felt quite novel. At the time, I suggested to the county leader standing next to me that the house should be preserved as a scenic spot on the island. I said that one day, people might tire of high-rise buildings and yearn for the simplicity of thatched-roof houses, which could become fashionable again. Unfortunately, now almost all such traditional houses made of local materials and seaweed have been replaced by brick and tile structures throughout the Jiaodong Peninsula. As for Tongxiang, it already has the former residence of Feng Zikai, the memorial hall of Mao Dun, and the art exhibition hall of Jun Shen, which are all notable attractions. Adding West Gate Street to the mix further enhances Tongxiang's scenic beauty. Moreover, preserving old streets can contribute to the construction of spiritual civilization and serve as an excellent educational resource for future generations to learn about patriotism and love for their hometown. Therefore, why not preserve these old streets?

    乌镇西栅一条街
    毕克官
    这次在浙江桐乡，是为陪伴家人瞻仰丰子恺故居缘缘堂。到了那里，友人们众口一词，说一个叫西栅的地方，是不可不去的。
    西栅乃桐乡乌镇的一处地方，是一条窄长小街。据传小街历史悠久，早在唐代就很繁荣。几经沧桑，现存的建筑是清末民初所建，但保留了宋明风貌。沿街二层阁楼，相互邻毗。雕檐刻栏，错落有致。街面很窄，有如《林家铺子》所描写的，街两边的店员可以对话聊天。小街之所以有名，还因为有处“桥中桥”景观，在两条河道的交接处，分别从不同方向建了两座桥。从大桥的桥洞里能看到小桥。大桥名通济，又称栅桥；小桥名仁济，又称栅桥，均重建于明代正德年间。从一座桥的桥洞看另一座桥本不稀罕，西栅的特点在于西桥位置特殊，形成的景观画面不同一般，所以受人青睐。
    在当今拆旧布新争相现代化的建筑热中，桐乡境内能完整地留住一条旧街，不免感到惊讶。说实话，保住像西栅这条街并不容易。首先，新建楼群为一地建设成就的主要标志之一，为主政者的奋斗目标。旧街道旧建筑是否有保留价值，也就易被忽略；其次，当地居民可能搞不通，人家都迁居新楼，自己还住旧屋，能不动心？仅此二条，事情往往难办。桐乡居然能办到，让人佩服了。
    记得前年在烟台养马岛，位于洋楼丛中。偶于田林之间看到一座茅屋四合院，觉得十分新鲜。当时就向身旁的县领导建议，千万保留下来，做为岛上一处景观。我说，有一天人们看腻了住腻了高楼洋房，就会回过头来想念茅屋，它还会时髦的。遗憾的是，现在整个胶东这种就地取材用海草搭建的民房几乎全为砖瓦建筑代替了。再以桐乡而言，有丰子恺故居缘缘堂，茅盾故居陈列馆和君匋艺术院书画展览厅，已经令人瞩目。再加上西栅一条街，等于给桐乡风景画上增添了浓重的一笔。再说，保留一点古旧街道也有利于精神文明的建设，是对子孙后代进行爱国爱乡土教育的好教材。如此，何乐而不为呢！
