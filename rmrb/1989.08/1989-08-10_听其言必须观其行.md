The heads of state of five Central American countries reached an agreement on August 7 to disband the more than 10,000 Nicaraguan anti-government forces supported and stationed in Honduras by the United States within 90 days. The presidents of the five countries expressed satisfaction with the positive results of the meeting. Óscar Arias Sánchez, the President of Costa Rica who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to achieve peace in Central America, said that the agreement's success once again demonstrates that dialogue is the best way to resolve conflicts. "The true path to solving the Central American problem should be diplomatic negotiations."

On August 8, the U.S. government stated that it supports the agreement reached by the five Central American presidents in Tegucigalpa, but it also said, "Listen to their words, but watch their actions." This statement is not wrong in itself. However, coming from the U.S. government, it carries a different meaning.

It is well known that the main obstacle to achieving peace in Central America is the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, which were organized and supported by the United States as a means to "pressure the Sandinistas." Now, although the U.S. government has agreed to disband them, it emphasizes that this must be done under "voluntary, safe, and democratic conditions." This lays the groundwork for future complications. According to the U.S. plan, as long as the anti-government forces do not "voluntarily" disband, do not feel "safe," and believe that Nicaragua is not "democratic" enough, they can refuse to disband. Recall that just before the summit, Bush called two Central American presidents, urging them to delay the disbandment of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces. There are also reports that some people in the U.S. government want to postpone the disbandment of the anti-government forces until after the Nicaraguan elections in February next year. It is clear that the U.S. government's agreement to disband them is a reluctant concession. Whether Washington will secretly sabotage this agreement, people cannot help but deeply suspect. Therefore, there is reason to not only "listen to their words" but also to "watch their actions" regarding the U.S. support for disbanding the Nicaraguan anti-government forces.

    听其言必须观其行
    中美洲5国首脑8月7日达成协议，将在90天内遣散由美国支持驻扎在洪都拉斯的1万多名尼加拉瓜反政府武装。对于会议取得的积极成果，5国总统咸感满意。为实现中美洲和平奔走而获得诺贝尔奖的哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯说，协议的达成再次表明对话是解决冲突的最好形式，“真正解决中美洲问题的途径应是外交谈判”。
    8月8日美国政府表示，支持中美洲5国总统在特拉达成的协议，但是它又说“听其言必须观其行”。此话本来不错。但出自美国政府之口却别有一层意思。
    人所共知，实现中美洲和平重要障碍的尼加拉瓜反政府武装是美国一手组织和支持的，是它“对桑地诺分子施加压力的手段”。现在美国政府虽然同意遣散他们，但又强调必须在“自愿、安全和民主的条件下”进行。这就埋下了伏笔。按照美国人的盘算，只要反政府武装分子不“自愿”，认为“安全”没有保障和尼加拉瓜仍不够“民主”，就可以拒绝遣散。回想首脑会议召开前夕，布什曾打电话给两位中美洲国家总统，要求他们推迟遣散尼反政府武装。还有报道说，美国政府中一些人想把遣散反政府武装推迟到明年2月尼大选之后。可见美国政府之所以被迫同意遣散他们，实在是“无可奈何花落去”也。对此，华盛顿是否会明里暗里从中作梗，人们不能不深表怀疑。因此，有理由对美国支持遣散尼反政府武装，不仅“听其言”，而且必须“观其行”。·立中·
