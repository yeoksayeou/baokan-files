Today, the organizing committee of the 11th Asian Games held a press conference attended by 23 news agencies from the capital and related provinces and cities, formally announcing the issuance of the Asian Games fund lottery nationwide starting today. The first batch of lottery tickets issued amounts to 400 million yuan, with a plan to raise 120 million yuan for the Asian Games. The first batch of lottery tickets issued in August includes Beijing, Tianjin, Guizhou, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Hebei. Committee leaders Wu Shaozu, He Zhenliang, and other attendees immediately purchased lottery tickets, expressing their concern and support for the Asian Games.

Wu Shaozu, the executive chairman of the Asian Games organizing committee, emphasized the significance and feasibility of issuing the Asian Games fund lottery. He said: The 11th Asian Games is the first continental-level sports event held in our country, with an unprecedented scale and number of participants in Asian history, attracting global attention and even more concern from the Chinese people. Purchasing fund lottery tickets is a way for the masses to show their concern and support for the Asian Games, and it is an important channel for raising funds for the Asian Games. The issuance of the fund lottery has been approved by the State Council and the People's Bank of China. It will enhance the public's sense of participation and mobilize people from all walks of life across the country to work together to ensure the success of the Asian Games. He said that issuing lottery tickets is both an international practice and a demand from the public, hoping that the issuance of the Asian Games fund lottery will proceed smoothly and healthily.

Wang Zhiliang, the director of the Asian Games fundraising department, detailed the organization and issuance of the fund lottery tickets. To strengthen organizational leadership and supervision, a leading group for the fund lottery work was established, with Zhang Baifa, the deputy chairman of the Asian Games organizing committee, as the head, and representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce participating.

The Asian Games fund lottery is a commemorative security with three main features. First, the face value is low, with a basic face value of 1 yuan. Second, there are more chances to win, with two draws and a total winning rate of 31%. Third, the lottery tickets are exquisitely made, featuring a vivid image of the Asian Games mascot, the panda, which has both practical and collectible value and can be used as a bookmark.

The issuance method of the fund lottery adopts a multi-channel, contract-based approach for franchising or agency sales. Any group, unit, or enterprise that has been approved by the local government, meets the issuance conditions, and has a financial institution or an economically capable entity as a guarantor can apply to the fund lottery issuance department for the sale of lottery tickets.

Tonight, the inaugural ceremony for the Asian Games fund lottery will be held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall Theater.
