Wudang Boxing Gains Attention from Domestic and International Martial Arts Practitioners

Martial Arts Experts Gather in Beijing to Discuss Research and Development

BEIJING, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) — The famous Chinese martial art, Wudang Boxing, has garnered significant attention from martial arts enthusiasts both domestically and internationally. Today, a group of martial arts experts and scholars convened at the Laoshan Sports Training Base to discuss the development of this martial art. Zhu Daojun, the deputy director of the Wudang Boxing Research Association, traveled from Wudang Mountain to share a collection of valuable Wudang Boxing techniques and academic papers that have long been preserved in the community.

The materials presented at the meeting were extensive, including "Wudang Lingbao Jinshui Secret Techniques," "Wudang Taiyi Gate Iron Pine Branch Techniques," and the "Thirteen Postures of Tai Chi" created by Zhang Sanfeng. Experts found these materials to be of great value, and the academic papers were also deeply insightful.

Many Daoists from Wudang Mountain possess remarkable martial arts skills. Zhu Chengde, nearly 90 years old, remains in good health and performed martial arts for the attendees. Numerous examples and materials demonstrate that Wudang Boxing is highly effective for fitness, longevity, medical treatment, and competitive performances. Martial arts experts such as Li Tianji, Professor Yang Shaoyu, and Associate Researcher Hao Xinglian all agreed that significant efforts should be made to excavate and organize Wudang Boxing to promote its further development.

    武当拳受到海内外重视
    武术家在京进行研究探讨
    本报北京8月18日讯“北尊少林，南崇武当”，我国武术的重要拳种——武当拳已受到海内外武林人士的关注。今天，一些武术家和学者在老山体育训练基地聚会，专门研究如何发展这个拳种的问题。专程从武当山赶来的武当拳法研究会副会长朱道琼向大家提供了一批深藏在民间的武当拳种宝贵资料和学术论文。
    会上提供的材料相当丰富，有“武当灵宝金水秘功”“武当太乙门铁松支派功法”以及张三丰创造的“太极十三式”等等，专家们感到很有价值，学术论文亦有深度。
    武当山一些道人颇有功夫，朱诚德年近90岁，身体仍很健康，并给人表演武术。许多事例和资料表明，武当拳对于健身、延年益寿、医疗、竞技表演等都有很大的作用。武术家李天骥、教授杨绍虞、副研究员郝心莲等都认为要下大力气挖掘整理武当拳，使其得到较大的发展。
