	Quality of Export Goods and Contract Fulfillment Rate Declining; China's Foreign Trade Reputation Suffering
	Tian Jiyun Calls for Responsibility at All Levels and Strict Rewards and Punishments

	BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, due to various reasons, the quality of export goods and the contract fulfillment rate have significantly declined, damaging China's foreign trade image and becoming an issue that cannot be ignored.

	The National Conference on Keeping Contracts and Maintaining Credibility to Improve Foreign Trade Reputation opened today in Beijing. This conference, specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned problems, is the first of its kind since the founding of the nation.

	In his speech, Zheng Tuobin, Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, pointed out that ensuring the quality of goods and timely contract fulfillment is fundamental to the development of export trade. However, currently, some foreign trade enterprises and supply units frequently neglect product quality, do not prioritize contracts, and fail to uphold credibility. There have even been serious instances of exporting counterfeit goods and deceiving customers.

	It is understood that the contract fulfillment rate for export contracts signed with foreign entities has dropped to its lowest level in recent years. There are increasing instances of failing to fulfill contracts on time, and even unilateral contract breaches by Chinese entities.

	Zheng Tuobin pointed out that the various issues related to quality and contract fulfillment have directly impacted the sustained and stable development of China's foreign trade exports. Not only have many foreign businesses filed claims and complaints against China, but some issues have even been escalated to the level of government-to-government negotiations.

	To quickly reverse the declining trend in the quality of export goods and contract fulfillment rates, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade has required the following four aspects of work:

	Firmly establish the concept of "quality first, credibility first." All levels of foreign economic and trade departments, various types of foreign trade enterprises, and export production enterprises across the country must treat quality and credibility as hard tasks to tackle.

	Strengthen management at all levels. Strictly control the contract signing process, and for unqualified products, it is better not to export them than to purchase them.

	Strictly enforce relevant regulations and establish and improve necessary rules and regulations. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade is currently drafting "Regulations on Prohibiting the Export of Counterfeit Goods" and "Several Regulations on Strengthening the Management of Export Contract Fulfillment Rates," which will be issued for implementation soon.

	Clearly reward and commend advanced entities, and resolutely punish all illegal and derelict behaviors.

	At the conference, 37 enterprises were commended, while 12 enterprises with poor quality, counterfeit goods, and low contract fulfillment rates were criticized and penalized.

	In other news, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, at the closing of the National Conference on Keeping Contracts and Maintaining Credibility to Improve Foreign Trade Reputation, proposed that relevant departments of the State Council and local governments at all levels must attach great importance to maintaining China's foreign trade reputation and strengthening the leadership of this work.

	Tian Jiyun pointed out that ensuring the quality of export goods and maintaining foreign trade credibility directly reflects our national spirit, relates to China's international image, and is a concrete manifestation of patriotism. The quality of export goods and contract fulfillment rates are not only economic issues but also political ones, affecting the overall situation.

	Tian Jiyun said that we have laws and regulations to follow for managing the quality of export goods. We must strictly enforce the law. Each department and each link must take responsibility. If a problem occurs at a certain link, the responsibility of that link must be investigated. Good performance should be commended and rewarded, while poor performance should be criticized and punished. Illegal behaviors must be severely cracked down on. Rewards and punishments must be clear, and actions must be genuine. For those who disregard national credibility, export substandard goods, and cause serious international impacts, the relevant units and responsible individuals must be thoroughly investigated and seriously dealt with, with no leniency or tolerance.

    出口商品质量和合同履约率差
    我国外贸信誉下降
    田纪云要求各环节负起责任严格奖惩
    本报北京8月21日讯　记者刘霄报道：近年来，由于种种原因，出口商品质量和履约率明显下降，损害了我国外贸形象，成为一个不容忽视的问题。
    全国重合同、守信用，提高对外贸易信誉工作会议今天在此间开幕。为解决上述问题而专门召开会议，建国以来还是第一次。
    经贸部部长郑拓彬在讲话中指出，保证商品质量和按期履约是发展出口贸易的根本所在。但是目前一些外贸企业和供货单位忽视商品质量、不重合同、不守信用的现象屡有发生，甚至出现了出口商品掺假作伪、欺骗客户的严重问题。
    据了解，对外签订的出口合同，履约率已经降到近年来的最低水平，不按期履约，甚至我单方面撕毁合同的情况越来越多。
    郑拓彬指出，质量和履约方面的种种问题，已经直接影响到我国外贸出口持续稳定的发展。不仅许多外商向我提出索赔和申诉，有的问题甚至提到两国政府来交涉。
    为了迅速扭转出口商品质量和履约率下降的局面，经贸部要求做好四方面的工作：
    牢固树立“质量第一、信誉第一”的观念，全国各级经贸部门、各类外贸企业和出口生产企业，都要把质量和信誉作为硬任务来抓。
    加强各个环节的管理。严格把好签约关，对不合格的产品，宁可不出口，也不能收购。
    严格执行有关法规，建立和完善必要的规章制度。经贸部正在拟定《关于严禁出口掺假作伪商品的规定》和《关于加强出口合同履约率管理工作的若干规定》，将很快下发执行。
    旗帜鲜明地表彰和奖励先进，坚决惩处各种违法、渎职行为。
    在会上，37家企业受到表彰，12家质量低劣、掺假作伪和履约率差的企业受到批评和处分。
    又讯　国务院副总理田纪云在今天结束的全国重合同、守信用，提高对外贸易信誉工作会议上提出，国务院有关部门和地方各级政府都要高度重视，维护我国外贸信誉，加强对这项工作的领导。
    田纪云指出，保证出口商品质量和维护外贸信誉，直接反映我们的民族精神，关系到我国的国际形象，也是爱国主义精神的具体体现。出口商品质量和合同履约率，不仅是经济问题，也是一个政治问题，事关大局。
    田纪云说，对出口商品质量的管理，我们是有法规和制度可依的，必须严格执法。各个部门，各个环节都要负起责任来。哪个环节出了问题，要追究哪个环节的责任。好的要表扬和奖励，坏的要批评和惩罚，违法行为要严厉打击。一定要奖惩分明，要动真的。对那些不顾国家信誉，出口伪劣商品，对外造成严重影响的单位和有关责任者，一定要追查到底，严肃处理，决不姑息迁就。
