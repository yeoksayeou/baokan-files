Venezuela's ruling party, Democratic Action, yesterday established a moral court within the party to investigate and handle cases of lawbreaking and disciplinary issues among its members.

This moral court within the party consists of 5 regular members and 5 alternate members, all of whom were elected through a secret ballot by the Central Executive Committee. The secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party, Cheyi, said that the establishment of this court is an important step in rectifying the party when administrative departments engage in lawbreaking activities. He also said that the party hopes to uncover the truth behind public rumors and to determine the party's stance on these issues as soon as possible.

Currently, Venezuela's judicial department and parliament are conducting a large-scale investigation into the corruption within the former Foreign Exchange Control Bureau. As the ruling party of the previous government, many officials of the Democratic Action Party have been implicated.

    委执政党建立道德法庭  调查处理党员违法乱纪
    本报加拉加斯8月8日电　记者朱满庭报道：委内瑞拉执政党民主行动党中央执行委员会昨天在党内建立了一个道德法庭，以便调查和处理党员的违法乱纪问题。
    这个党内道德法庭由5名正式成员和5名候补成员组成，是由中央执委会通过秘密投票选举产生的。民行党总书记切伊说，任命这个法庭是在行政部门发生违法行为时进行党内整顿的重要一步。他还说，希望通过这个道德法庭了解公众议论的事情的真相，尽早确定党对这些问题的立场。
    委内瑞拉司法部门和议会目前正在大规模调查原来的外汇管制局中的营私舞弊问题。民行党作为上届政府的执政党，不少官员受到牵连。
