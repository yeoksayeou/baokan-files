Recently, Heilongjiang Province has seized opportunities and implemented the "South Connect, North Open, All-Round Opening" development strategy. Border trade and economic-technical cooperation with the Soviet Union have become increasingly active, driving the province's economic construction to a thriving stage.

Heilongjiang Province has nearly a hundred pairs of border towns with the Soviet Union, separated by only a river and a border. In April 1982, the two sides resumed border trade that had been suspended for 15 years. In 1987, the border trade volume reached 34.227 million Swiss francs, doubling the 1983 figure. After the provincial Party committee and government proposed the "South Connect, North Open, All-Round Opening" development strategy in early 1988, border trade developed even more rapidly. By the end of July this year, the total contract value of the province's border trade with the Soviet Union reached 1.066 billion Swiss francs, with 6.08 billion Swiss francs in new contracts signed this year. In the first seven months of this year, 2.51 billion Swiss francs worth of goods were traded. Alongside the rapid development of border trade, economic-technical cooperation with the Soviet Union has also made breakthrough progress. By the end of July this year, the province had accumulated 94 economic-technical cooperation contracts with the Soviet Union, with a total cooperation value of 1.1 billion Swiss francs. The main forms of cooperation are engineering contracts and labor exports, totaling 63 items, with over 9,000 laborers sent to the Soviet Union. Heilongjiang Province's border trade volume with the Soviet Union and the number of economic-technical cooperation project contracts both account for more than 60% of the national total.

Since the resumption of border trade in 1982, Heilongjiang Province's border economic trade with the Soviet Union has developed from small-scale, low-value, narrow-channel, single-partner border trade to a multi-level, multi-field, and integrated trade stage, combining industry and trade, and technology and trade. The number of export commodities has increased from 50 in 1987 to over 3,000 now.

In addition to the original border ports of Suifenhe, Heihe, and Tongjiang, the inland ports of Harbin, Jiamusi, and Fujin have begun to open to the Soviet Union. The air route from Harbin to the Soviet Union's Khabarovsk is also about to open.

"North Open" promotes "South Connect," and "South Connect" drives "North Open." Last year, more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country sent over 400 delegations to Heilongjiang Province for on-site inspections and business negotiations, reaching agreements or contracts to jointly build export commodity production bases and specialized factories for the Soviet Union. Projects such as ceramics, wool sweaters, and clothing have already started production.

    实施“南联北开”发展战略
    对苏边贸与经济技术合作方兴未艾
    本报讯　近年来，黑龙江省抓住机遇，推行“南联北开，全方位开放”的发展战略，对苏边境贸易与经济技术合作日益活跃，全省经济建设呈现蓬勃发展势头。
    黑龙江省与苏联毗邻城镇近百对，只有一界、一江之隔。1982年4月，双方恢复了中断15年之久的边境贸易。1987年边境贸易额达3422.7万瑞士法郎，比1983年翻一番。1988年初，省委、省政府提出“南联北开，全方位开放”的发展战略后，边境贸易的发展更为迅速。截至今年7月末，全省对苏边境贸易在手合同总金额达10.66亿瑞士法郎，其中今年新签合同总金额为6.08亿瑞士法郎，今年头7个月实现过货2.51亿瑞士法郎。在边境贸易迅猛发展的同时，对苏经济技术合作也取得了突破性进展。到今年7月末，全省累计对苏经济技术合作合同已达94项，合作总金额为1.1亿瑞士法郎，合作的主要形式是工程承包和劳务输出，占63项，赴苏的劳务人员已达9000多人。黑龙江省的对苏边境贸易额和经济技术合作项目合同数均达到全国总数的60％以上。
    自1982年恢复边贸以来的7年间，黑龙江省与苏联的边境经济贸易已从金额小、品种少、渠道窄、伙伴单一的边境小额贸易发展到多层次、多领域和工贸结合、技贸结合的规模贸易阶段。出口商品品种由1987年的50种骤增到现在的3000多种。
    除原来的绥芬河、黑河、同江口岸外，哈尔滨、佳木斯、富锦3个内河港口开始对苏开放，哈尔滨至苏联哈巴罗夫斯克的空中航线也即将开通。
    “北开”促进“南联”，“南联”推动“北开”。去年全国有20多个省、市、自治区的400多个团组到黑龙江省实地考察和接洽业务，达成一批共建对苏出口商品生产基地、专厂的协议或合同，已有陶瓷、羊毛衫、服装等项目投入生产。
