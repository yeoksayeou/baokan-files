    Shenzhen Insurance Premiums Exceed Six Billion

    Our reporter has learned that in the first half of this year, Shenzhen's continuous increase in investment has promoted the prosperity of the insurance industry.

    According to statistics from the Shenzhen branch of the People's Insurance Company of China, the city's "three types of enterprises," "three comes one compensation," state-owned, collective enterprises, and urban and rural residents have newly increased insurance premiums for various risks amounting to 2 billion yuan, an increase of about 70% compared to the same period last year. Including past insurance responsibilities that are still ongoing, the total insurance premiums exceed 6 billion yuan.

    Insurance industry experts believe that the prosperity and development of the insurance industry are mainly due to the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy and the stable political and investment climate in Shenzhen. In the second quarter of this year, all 2,200 "three types of enterprises" and more than 3,900 "three comes one compensation" enterprises in the city have not stopped production due to disturbances. The funding for the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant, with an investment of tens of billions of dollars, continues to be executed according to the loan agreement signed and effective in 1986, and business dealings with British and French banks are proceeding as usual. The city's utilization of foreign capital in the first half of the year increased by nearly onefold compared to the same period last year.

    深圳保险额逾六百亿
    本报讯　今年头6个月，深圳市投资的不断增加，促进了保险业的兴旺。
    据中国人民保险公司深圳分公司的统计，该市“三资”、“三来一补”、国营、集体企业及城乡居民，新增投保各种风险的保险金额达200亿元，比去年同期增加70％左右，连同过去承保、现在责任未了的风险责任，保险金额超过600亿元。
    保险界人士认为，保险业的兴旺发展，主要得益于改革开放政策的实施和深圳市稳定的政治及投资气候。今年第二季度，全市2200家“三资”企业和3900多家“三来一补”企业，没有一家因动乱而停工。投资额高达数10亿美元的大亚湾核电站所需款项，仍按1986年签署生效的贷款总协议执行，与英、法银行的业务往来照常进行。全市上半年利用外资比去年同期增加近一倍。　（郑安　温德明）
