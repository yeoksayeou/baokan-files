Japan has a tradition of gift-giving, and in recent years, this custom has become increasingly popular. According to statistics, the sales of gifts in Japan last year exceeded one hundred billion dollars.

Japan experiences two major gift-giving seasons annually: one in the summer and the other at the end of the year. During these times, almost every Japanese person receives gifts ranging from small keychains to large motorcycles. These gifts are not always exchanged privately; many large items are awarded by superiors. Additionally, during regular visits to friends and relatives, people usually do not go empty-handed. For Japanese people, gift-giving seems to have become a method of maintaining interpersonal relationships.

Gift shops with a variety of colorful items can be found everywhere in Japan, and even the lobbies of hotels have gift counters. According to a sample survey by the *Japanese Economic Magazine*, the average hotel guest spends 5,000 yen (approximately thirty-five dollars) at the hotel's gift shop. Gift sales account for eleven percent of the hotel's total revenue and twenty-seven percent of its total profits.

The gift-giving custom in Japan has also extended to the political sphere, frequently causing scandals. The most recent example is the Recruit scandal, which shocked the world. Ordinary Japanese people are very angry about this kind of "gift-giving," believing it has tainted the political environment and desecrated the traditional Japanese custom of gift-giving.

    日本的“送礼风”
    日本人有送礼的习俗，尤其是近些年来，这股风越刮越烈。据统计，日本去年一年礼品消售额超过了一百亿美元。
    日本一年大体有两次送礼高潮。一次在夏季，另一次在岁末。每逢这个时候，几乎每个日本人都收到小到钥匙串大到摩托车的礼品。这些礼品并不都是私相授受，其中很多大件是上司的奖品。此外，一般人在平时访亲会友也绝不空手。对于日本人来讲，送礼似乎已成为维系人际关系的一种方法。
    琳琅满目、五光十色的礼品商店在日本到处可见，饭店的前厅也都设置了礼品柜台。据《日本经济杂志》的抽样调查，住在饭店的客人平均每人在饭店礼品部花费五千日元（约合三十五美元），礼品销售额占饭店总收入的百分之十一，占总利润的百分之二十七。
    日本的送礼风也刮到了政界，不断闹出风波，震惊世界的利库路特案就是最新的一例。普通日本人对这类“送礼风”感到非常气愤，认为它沾染上了政治腐败的气味，亵渎了日本的送礼风俗。
