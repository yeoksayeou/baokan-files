    It Is Better to Act Early Than Late
    Mò Cūn

    The stability of the contractor's mind ensures the stability of enterprise production. Facing the expiration of the contract, contractors have various thoughts. Will they continue with the next contract? In this mindset, some wait and observe, while others seek immediate benefits. Of course, it is necessary to educate the factory director to "stand the last watch" and lay a good foundation for the next contractor. However, determining an appropriate contract transition method earlier will be more welcomed by contractors. The city of Rìzhào provided contractors with "peace of mind" at the beginning of the year, allowing the majority of enterprise managers to focus on production, which is worth emulating by other regions.

    It has been nearly three years since China implemented the contract responsibility system in enterprises. This year, about 60-70% of enterprises have reached the end of their contracts. To ensure the continuity of enterprise production, the government's supervisory departments have the responsibility to provide contractors with a "peace of mind" early, and to issue transition methods promptly, so that enterprises with expiring contracts can have normal plans and arrangements for their production and operations. Even for enterprises that are not performing well, whether through re-bidding or mergers, early action can avoid greater losses. If the contract is about to expire and the policy is delayed, contractors will be uncertain, creating a "vacuum" between the two contract periods, inevitably affecting the continuity of production and sales work.

    Arranging enterprise contract transitions early, especially ensuring the relative stability of contractors for enterprises that are performing well, helps to overcome short-term behaviors in enterprises. One of the causes of short-term behaviors by factory directors is the short contract term. Allowing successful factory directors to continue will not only extend the contract term but also avoid some negative effects of re-bidding.

    Enterprise contract transitions are complex and detailed work that requires supervisory departments to deeply study new problems in the development of the contract system, understand the thoughts of contractors, and develop strategies for different contract enterprises. This process should be continuously improved so that each subsequent contractor has guidelines to follow. Only then can the contract system play its due role.

    宜早不宜迟
    墨村
    承包人心稳，企业生产才会稳。面对承包到期，承包人想法颇多，下期承包还干不干？在这种心态下，等待观望者有之，捞实惠者有之。当然，通过教育要求厂长“站好最后一班岗”，为下期承包者打好基础，很有必要。而早一步确定一个适当的承包衔接办法，更会受到承包者的欢迎。日照市在年初就给承包者吃“定心丸”，使占多数的企业经营者能安心抓生产，值得各地借鉴。
    我国在企业中广泛推行承包责任制已近三年，今年有百分之六七十的企业承包到期。为保证企业生产的连续性，政府主管部门有责任早给承包者一颗“定心丸”，衔接办法早出台，使承包到期的企业能对自己的生产经营活动有一个正常的计划和安排。就是那些经营得不好的企业，或重新招标，或走兼并的道路，也能及早进行工作，避免造成更大的损失。如果承包即将到期，政策姗姗来迟，承包者举棋不定，就会在两个承包期之间造成“真空”，势必影响生产销售工作的连续性。
    及早安排企业承包衔接工作，特别是使那些生产经营搞得好的企业承包人相对稳定，有利于克服企业短期行为。造成厂长短期行为的原因之一是承包期限短。让有成绩的厂长接着干，既延长了承包期，也避免了重新招标带来的一些副作用。
    企业承包衔接是件复杂细致的工作，需要企业主管部门深入研究承包制发展中的新问题，了解承包者的想法，针对不同承包企业的情况，拿出对策，并不断完善，使以后每届到期的承包人有所遵循。这样，承包制才会发挥应有的作用。
