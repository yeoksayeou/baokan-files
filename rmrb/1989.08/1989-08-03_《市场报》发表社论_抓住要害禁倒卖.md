The August 3rd edition of the *Market News* published an editorial titled "Crack Down on the Root Cause of Speculation." The editorial states that from January to April of this year, a total of 356 carloads of timber were shipped to Anyang. Out of these, only 140 carloads were supplied to coal mines, match factories, and other enterprises for production. The remaining over 210 carloads of timber were being resold by various companies. This figure reflects a fact: the phenomenon of speculation in the circulation sector remains unchecked.

Speculation continues, but the types of goods being speculated have changed. This year, the sales of some consumer goods have slowed down. Items that were previously in high demand have become more common, and those that were previously common have become stagnant. Therefore, fewer people are speculating on consumer goods like color televisions and refrigerators. Instead, the "speculators" have shifted their focus to production materials, such as fertilizers, pesticides, steel, aluminum, timber, and other light industrial raw materials.

The editorial notes that since the beginning of this year, farmers have repeatedly called for more fertilizers and pesticides. In the first half of the year, many light industrial enterprises experienced a decline in production. The main reason for this decline, aside from insufficient funds, is the shortage of raw materials. According to the production plan, the Anyang match factory in Henan province was supposed to receive 6,750 cubic meters of timber in the first half of the year, but from January to May, it only received 1,516 cubic meters, which is only 22.4% of the planned supply. On one hand, state-owned large enterprises are struggling without raw materials, while on the other hand, certain companies are speculating with a significant amount of production materials in the circulation sector. The serious consequences of speculation on production materials, which disrupt production and economic order, are evident.

The editorial concludes by suggesting that, given the change in the types of goods being speculated, it is necessary for local authorities to focus on cleaning up companies that speculate in raw materials. This will help in effectively stopping speculation.

   《市场报》发表社论
    抓住要害禁倒卖
    本报讯　八月三日出版的《市场报》发表社论，题为《抓住要害禁倒卖》。社论说，今年一至四月份，运到安阳的木材共三百五十六个车皮，其中供应煤矿、火柴厂等企业用于生产的仅一百四十个车皮，其余二百一十多个车皮的木材是一些公司倒买倒卖的。这个数字反映了一个事实：流通领域的倒卖现象仍然禁而未止。
    倒卖在继续，倒卖的商品却有变化。今年以来，一些消费品销势趋缓，以往俏销的，有些已转平，以往平销的，有些已转滞。因此，倒彩电、冰箱等消费品的人少了，“倒爷”们的倒卖对象集中到生产资料上，倒化肥、农药等农资，倒钢材、铝材、木材和其他轻工原料。
    社论说，今年年初至今，农民不断发出呼吁，化肥短缺，农药短缺。上半年，不少轻工企业生产滑坡。滑坡原因除资金不足外，主要是原材料短缺。按生产计划，河南安阳火柴厂上半年需要木材六千七百五十立方米，一至五月仅得到一千五百一十六立方米，占计划供应的百分之二十二点四。一方面是国营大企业无米下锅，另一方面是某些公司将数量可观的生产资料在流通领域中倒来倒去。倒卖生产资料，破坏生产、扰乱经济秩序的严重后果，由此可见一斑。
    社论最后提出，鉴于被倒卖的商品发生变化，人们认为，目前各地清理公司，应该重点清理那些倒卖原材料的
  “倒爷”公司，以便抓住要害，及时、有效地制止倒卖。
