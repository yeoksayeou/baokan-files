The "Encircling the Mountain" project is a name given to a forestation and ecological restoration project in Qianxi County, Hebei Province, based on the unique characteristics of the Yanshan Mountains. This project has increased the county's afforestation area by 50,000 mu (approximately 3,333 hectares) annually. Since 1986, the county has achieved an afforestation area of 170,000 mu (approximately 113,333 hectares), earning the title of "National Afforestation Advanced Unit." In July of this year, the county's "Encircling the Mountain" project, known for its large scale, high standards, and good returns, was recognized as a pioneering effort in the capital's surrounding afforestation projects after passing the inspection by the Ministry of Forestry.

The story begins ten years ago in the Sahe Bridge Work Committee, which oversees six townships. At that time, the most valuable asset was the mountain land, with 400,000 mu (approximately 266,666 hectares) of mountain land for 40,000 people. The most famous product was chestnuts, with the "Four Great Gorges of Chestnuts" all located in this area. Li Zuojiu, the secretary of the Sahe Bridge Work Committee, had a clear vision: if farmers wanted to get rich, they should plant chestnut trees on the mountains. He led the cadres to survey one mountain after another, and a bold plan for mountain restoration was born: regardless of the shape of the mountains, if we connect one afforestation point after another along the contour lines of the mountains, and then arrange the engineering projects on these contour lines in an orderly manner from the foot to the top of the mountain, making the engineering projects encircle the mountain, the soil and water will not flow down the mountain, and the chestnut trees will form a continuous forest. This is indeed the key to restoring the mountains!

With the plan in mind, Li Zuojiu set foot on one mountain after another, leaving a series of contour lines around the mountains. The farmers, following his "lines," dug horizontal ditches every 5 meters in elevation, 2 meters wide and 1 meter deep, with an outer ridge and an inner water-holding area, from the foot to the top of the mountain, encircling and interlocking. Over three years, Li Zuojiu surveyed 5,000 kilometers of "lines," and the farmers dug 5,000 kilometers of ditches, planting 1 million chestnut saplings in these horizontal ditches. This became the foundation of the "Encircling the Mountain" project.

Ten years later, the mountains turned green, and the trees benefited. The 1 million chestnut saplings planted at that time became green ribbons tying together 20,000 mu (approximately 1,333 hectares) of large and small mountain tops. The once barren mountains began to contribute an annual output value of over 10 million yuan to the people. The weather became favorable, with continuous rainfall of 200 millimeters causing no harm, and the grain harvest in the mountains was bountiful year after year. Without increasing the arable land area, the yield doubled. The Sahe Bridge Work Committee thus transformed from the poorest region in the county to the richest.

In fact, the "Encircling the Mountain" project in Sahe Bridge had already attracted the attention of the county government. Qianxi is a mountainous area with more than 5 mu (approximately 333 hectares) of mountain land per person, but less than 1 mu (approximately 66 hectares) of arable land per person. In 1987, County Magistrate Zhang Yanjun and Deputy Magistrate Zhang Shangda, while planning the county's agricultural and industrial production, first thought of Qianxi's mountains and the "Encircling the Mountain" project in Sahe Bridge. That autumn, a seminar chaired by the county magistrate was held on the mountain where the "Encircling the Mountain" project was located. Everyone inspected and discussed the "Encircling the Mountain" project. The mountains in Qianxi are gentle slopes, mostly Yanshan schist, and the "Encircling the Mountain" project, through engineering, achieved the weathering of schist soil, creating conditions for water and soil conservation on the mountains, providing a suitable environment for the growth of fruit trees. Several local environments formed a stepped overall environment along the mountain slope, effectively utilizing and developing the space and light conditions in the mountainous area, forming unique conditions superior to flatland afforestation. The mountain top is suitable for forestry, the middle for fruit trees, and the foot for grains. The "Encircling the Mountain" project actually transforms into a model of three-dimensional agricultural development in mountainous areas. After the seminar, the county party committee and government issued the "Decision on Promoting the Development of Forestry and Fruit Production." The county, township, and town leaders implemented 120 "Encircling the Mountain" projects. In less than a year, 120 barren mountain tops of over 100 mu (approximately 6.6 hectares) each were transformed into green mountain tops, afforesting 13,000 mu (approximately 8,666 hectares) of barren mountains.

In the spring of 1988, County Magistrate Chen Zheng took office and received two investigation reports from his predecessor. He had read these two reports countless times: Yangjia Gorge was the first village in Sahe Bridge to implement the "Encircling the Mountain" project. The village's chestnut production increased from the original 80,000 jin (approximately 4,000 kilograms) to 280,000 jin (approximately 14,000 kilograms), with a 76% increase in fruit income. Why? The village had a party branch secretary, Peng Yonghua, known as the "Chestnut Expert." Ten years ago, Peng Yonghua managed to retain several technical personnel from the provincial fruit research institute, and all the trees planted were under their guidance and scientific management. The entire village learned several new techniques for fruit tree management from them. What about Chagou Village? Separated from Yangjia Gorge by just one mountain, the 1,200 mu (approximately 800 hectares) "Encircling the Mountain" project inside had also planted more than 10,000 fruit trees ten years ago, but the trees did not grow, and not a single fruit was seen... These two reports were a heavy burden!

Chen Zheng came to another "Encircling the Mountain" demonstration project in Luanyin Township. He set up a "camp" on the mountain top, stationing experts from the Forestry Bureau, Agricultural Bureau, and Water Resources Bureau. They researched and promoted one project after another. They created a method of combining long-term and short-term benefits with chestnuts as the main crop and walnuts as the secondary crop; the promotion of superior chestnut seed selection formed four superior seed zones in the county; superior grafting and optimized management shortened the growth and fruiting period of chestnuts by 5 years... Chen Zheng, together with other county government officials, established the first national chestnut research institute in the country, pushing the "Encircling the Mountain" project into a series of scientific controls. Looking at today's "Encircling the Mountain" project in Qianxi, the mountain top is covered with pine and locust trees, the middle with chestnut trees, and the foot with grass, pears, and peaches; forming a three-dimensional ecological pattern of interplanting trees and grains, and combining woody and herbaceous plants in the mountainous area.

    迁西干部“围山转”
    刘永江　杨玉满　杨文东
    “围山转”是河北迁西县依据燕山特点，开发的一项治山造林工程的名称。就靠着这“围山转”工程，迁西的绿化面积以每年5万亩的速度递增。自1986年以来，全县造林面积达17万亩，荣获“全国绿化先进单位”称号。今年7月，这个县又以“围山转”造林工程规模大、标准高、效益好，居国内先进水平，顺利通过林业部的验收，被认定为首都周围绿化工程的一大创举。
    话还得从10年前说起，洒河桥工委所辖6个乡，当年最富有的是山场，4万口人却有40万亩山场；最出名的是板栗，中外闻名的“板栗四大峪”全居此地。担任洒河桥工委书记的李作久认准了一个理：农民要想富，山上植栗树。他带领干部转了一个山头又一个山头，一个大胆的治山设想也跟着诞生了：山，不管山形千变万变，如按山体的等高线把一个又一个造林点连接起来，再把一条条等高线上的工程，有序地从山脚布局到山顶，使工程围着山转，水土不下山，栗树连成片，这不正是治山的妙方吗？
    思路成熟了，李作久双脚踩向了一座座山头，留下了一圈又一圈围山体等高线。农民按他的“线”，每高程5米，挖一条宽2米，深1米，外留埂，里汪水的水平沟，从山脚一直开到山顶，圈罗圈，环扣环。3年间，李作久踩了5000公里的“线”，农民共挖了5000公里长的沟，又在水平沟里栽下100万株栗树，这便成了以后的“围山转”。
    10年后，山变绿，树受益。当年栽下的100万株栗树成了一条条绿色的飘带系住了2万多亩大大小小的山头，昔日的荒山开始向人们每年贡献高达1000多万元的产值。这里风调雨顺了，连续降雨200毫米不能为害，山里的粮食连年丰收，在不增耕地面积的情况下，产量却增加了一倍。洒河桥工委因此由全县最贫困的地区，一跃成为最富裕的地区。
    其实，洒河桥的“围山转”早已引起了县里的重视。迁西山多，人均5亩有余；地少，人均一亩不足。1987年，县长张彦钧和副县长张尚达主持规划全县工农业生产，首先想到的就是迁西的山，就是洒河桥的“围山转”。那年秋天，由县长主持的研讨会，在洒河桥“围山转”工程的山头召开。大家考察着“围山转”，论证着“围山转”。迁西的山，坡缓，多属燕山片麻岩，“围山转”正是通过工程作用，实现了片麻岩土质风化，创造了山上的水土肥保持条件，提供了一个适宜果树生长的局部环境；而若干个局部环境形成依山体坡度而成的阶梯式整体环境，则有效地利用和开发了空间和山区的光照系数，使之又形成了优于平地成林的独特条件。山顶宜林，山中宜果，山下宜粮，“围山转”实际“转”出的是山区立体农业开发的模式。研讨会之后，县委、县政府关于《大力发展林果生产的决定》下发了。全县县、乡、镇120名主要“头头”，落实了120个“围山转”工程的山头。不到一年时间，120座百亩以上的荒山头，被“围山转”“转”成了绿山头，绿化荒山面积1.3万亩。
    1988年春，县长陈正上任伊始，从上一任县长手里接过两份调查材料。这两份调查材料他已不知翻了多少遍：杨家峪是洒河桥最早搞“围山转”的村子，全村板栗产量已由原来的8万斤，猛增到28万斤，林果收入增76％。原因是什么呢？村里有一个被冠以“板栗专家”的村支部书记彭永华。10年前，彭永华想办法留住了省果研所的几个科技人员，栽下的树全是按他们的指点，科学管理的。全村人都从他们那里学会了几手果树管理新招。岔沟村呢，与杨家峪村仅一山之隔，搞的1200亩“围山转”工程内，10年前也曾栽了1万多株果树，可栽下的树不见长，没见一颗果……两份材料，就是一副沉甸甸的担子啊！
    陈正来到县里又一个“围山转”样板工程的滦阴乡。山头上扎下“大营”，屯下林业局、农业局、水利局的大小专家们。一个课题一个课题地研究、推广。他们以板栗为主的栗桃间植，创造了长短效益相结合的方法；板栗优种选育的推广，使全县形成了四个优种区划；优种嫁接，优化管理，又把板栗的生长结果周期缩短了5年……陈正还和县政府其他同志一道，筹办起全国第一家板栗研究所，把“围山转”工程推向了系列的科学调控之中。再看今天迁西的“围山转”工程，已是山顶松槐戴帽，山中板栗缠腰，山脚草果梨桃；形成林粮间作，乔灌结合的山区立体化生态格局。
