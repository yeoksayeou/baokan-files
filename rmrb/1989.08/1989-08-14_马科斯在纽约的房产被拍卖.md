The former Philippine President Marcos' skyscraper in New York was auctioned off yesterday for a high price of $108.6 million. This is one of the highest transaction prices in New York's real estate history.

The skyscraper is located on Wall Street and was completed in 1929. At that time, it was the tallest building in New York, but it only held this title for a few weeks.

The new owner of the building is the brothers Joseph Bernstein and Ralph Bernstein. These two wealthy individuals have expressed their intention to turn it into the crown jewel of Wall Street.

This skyscraper is one of the four buildings Marcos owned in New York. After Marcos was ousted from power, the new Philippine government stated that these properties were purchased with national funds, and therefore, the new government claims sovereignty over them.

    马科斯在纽约的房产被拍卖
    新华社纽约8月12日电　菲律宾前总统马科斯过去在纽约购置的一座摩天大楼昨天以1.086亿美元的高价拍卖成交。这是纽约房地产交易中的最高成交价之一。
    这幢摩天大楼座落在华尔街上，于1929年落成，当时是纽约的最高层建筑，但只保持了几个星期。
    这座大楼的新主人是约瑟夫·伯恩斯坦和拉尔夫·伯恩斯坦兄弟俩。这两位富豪表示要将它变成华尔街上的皇冠。
    这一摩天大楼是马科斯在纽约拥有的4座大楼中的一座。在马科斯被赶下台后，菲律宾新政府说，这些房产是马科斯用国家的钱买下的，因此新政府对它们拥有主权。
