A New Breeding Method Emerges

	The People's Daily reports: The first photoperiod-sensitive male-sterile line of japonica rice, 87N123, successfully selected by Zhou Yanbo, deputy researcher at the Hengyang Agricultural Science Institute, and his team, has recently passed a comprehensive technical appraisal. The emergence of this variety makes the transition from the "three-line system" to the "two-line system" in hybrid rice production a reality.

	After six years of effort, Zhou Yanbo and his team of agricultural technicians used the method of artificially creating sterile lines to select this new variety. This is a major breakthrough in China's breeding methods. The sterility conversion of the new variety is uniform, with both the sterility rate and the sterility plant rate reaching 100%.

    一种新育种方法问世
    本报讯　由衡阳市农科所副研究员周延波等选育成功的我国第一个无花粉型籼型水稻光敏不育系87N123，最近通过全面技术鉴定。这个品种的问世，使杂交水稻生产从“三系法”过渡到“两系法”变成了现实。
    周延波等农技人员是经过6年努力，用人工制造不育系的方法选育出这一新品种的，这是我国育种方法上的一个重大创举。新品种的育性转换整齐一致，不育度和不育株率均达100％。　（蔡八一）
