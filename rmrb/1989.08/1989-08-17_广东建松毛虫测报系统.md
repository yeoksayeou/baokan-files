Guangdong Province has established monitoring centers in 10 counties (cities, districts) and monitoring stations in 18 frequently affected areas, forming a pine caterpillar monitoring system. This system ensures that pine caterpillar infestations can be detected, reported, and treated early.

Pine caterpillars feed exclusively on pine needles and can strip entire stands of pine trees bare in just a few days. This year, the province has seen over 6.7 million acres of pine forests affected by these pests.

    广东建松毛虫测报系统
    新华社广州8月16日电（记者张开机）广东省在10个县（市、区）建立测报中心，在18个常灾区建立测报点，进而形成了松毛虫测报系统，使松毛虫危害能早发现、早报告、早防治。
    松毛虫专吃松针，常常几天内就把成片绿油油的松林吃成光杆。全省今年受害面积达670多万亩。
