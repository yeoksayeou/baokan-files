International Notes

The Dollar and "Cooperation"

Using its financial power to influence international organizations and make decisions that benefit its own interests seems to have become a common tactic for the United States.

For many years, the United States has owed the Organization of American States (OAS) $40 million, but the U.S. Congress has only approved the provision of $27 million, leaving the rest unpaid. So, how can this organization obtain the full amount of funds it needs? On the eve of the OAS foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the situation in Panama, many American legislators openly stated that this would depend on how much "cooperation" the organization could provide in getting Noriega out of Panama. Officials from the State Department also threatened that the United States was "running out of" time and patience with this organization, and if it failed to achieve the goal of removing Noriega from Panama this time, it might become the "big loser." In other words, if you want the United States to pay up, you have to cooperate with the United States; the more you cooperate, the more dollars the United States will pay. It seems clear where Washington places this organization, which has 31 member countries.

Indeed, the member countries of the OAS are willing to mediate the Panama conflict, hoping that the Panamanian parties will peacefully resolve the crisis, and advocating that the issue of Noriega's departure should be decided by the Panamanians themselves, with no foreign interference. However, the United States not only brutally interferes in Panama's internal affairs, attempting to steer the situation in a direction favorable to the United States, but also imposes its will on the OAS, exchanging dollars for its "cooperation." This is a miscalculation. Times have changed, and the era when the United States could dictate to this organization has long ended. The Latin American countries' stance on safeguarding national sovereignty, national dignity, and the principle of non-interference will not change for a few dollars.

### 美元与“合作”

    美元与“合作”
    利用自己的财力去影响国际组织，使之作出合乎自己利益的决定，这似乎已成为美国的一种惯用手段。
    美国多年来拖欠美洲国家组织4000万美元，但美国国会只批准提供2700万美元，其余的赖着不交。那么，这个组织如何才能得到它所需要的全部资金呢？在该组织即将举行讨论有关巴拿马局势的外长会议之际，许多美国议员毫不掩饰地宣称，这将取决于这个组织在使诺列加离开巴拿马方面能够给予（美国）多少“合作”。国务院官员还威胁说，美国对这个组织“正在失去”时间和耐心，如果它这次不能达到使诺列加离开巴拿马的目的，它可能成为“大输家”。说得明白一点，你要美国出钱么，就得跟美国合作；合作得越多，美国掏的美元也就越多。看来，华盛顿将这个拥有31个成员国的地区组织摆在什么位置，已经昭然若揭。
    诚然，美洲国家组织成员国愿意调解巴拿马冲突，希望巴拿马各方和平解决危机，并主张诺列加的去留问题应由巴拿马人自己去解决，任何外国无权干涉。可是，美国不仅粗暴干涉巴拿马内政，企图让局势朝着有利于美国的方向发展，而且还把自己的意志强加于美洲国家组织，以美元换取它的“合作”，这就打错了算盘。今非昔比，美国在该组织颐指气使的时代早已结束，拉美国家维护国家主权、民族尊严和不干涉原则的立场是不会为换取几个美元而改变的。
