The State Forestry Administration recently issued an emergency notice addressing the severe and spreading trend of forest pests and diseases this year, urging all regions to effectively carry out forest pest and disease prevention work.

According to the State Forestry Administration's summary of reports from various regions, in the first half of this year, the total area affected by forest pests and diseases nationwide reached 1.5 billion mu. In the "Three-North" Shelterbelt region, the affected area reached over 63 million mu. In addition to the continued severe outbreaks of major pests such as the pine caterpillar, bamboo locust, white-spotted longicorn beetle, yellow-spotted longicorn beetle, and poplar tent caterpillar, some previously less severe pests, such as the cypress tip moth in Sichuan and the larch sawfly in Inner Mongolia, have also become serious threats. In response to this severe situation, various regions have taken corresponding measures and done a lot of work. However, the overall situation remains grim. Therefore, the State Forestry Administration has notified all regions to focus on the following tasks:

	- All regions must attach great importance to forest pest and disease prevention work and must not be complacent. They must seriously implement various prevention measures. Forestry departments should promptly report the progress and existing problems of prevention work to local governments to gain strong support and assistance from leaders.

	- All levels of forest pest and disease prevention institutions should do a good job in technical guidance and services, and adopt various methods to control the spread of pests and diseases.

	- The funds allocated by the central and local governments for disaster relief must be managed and used properly. Limited funds should be used in the most severely affected areas to achieve the best prevention results.

    林业部发出紧急通知
    切实抓好森林病虫害防治
    本报北京8月11日讯　针对今年森林病虫害严重和不断蔓延的趋势，林业部最近发出紧急通知，要求各地切实做好森林病虫害防治工作。
    据林业部对各地情况的汇总，今年上半年，全国发生森林病虫害面积达1.5亿亩，其中“三北”防护林地区受灾面积达6300多万亩。除了松毛虫、竹蝗、光肩星天牛、黄斑星天牛、泡桐大袋蛾等主要病虫害继续大发生，一些过去不太严重的病虫害，如四川的蜀柏毒蛾、内蒙古的落叶松叶蜂等也暴发成灾。针对这一严重情况，各地采取了相应措施，做了大量的工作。但就全国范围来看，目前面临的形势还很严峻。为此，林业部通知各地做好以下几项工作：
    ——各地应十分重视森林病虫害防治工作，决不能掉以轻心。要认真落实各项防治措施。林业部门要及时将防治工作的进展情况和存在问题向当地政府报告，取得领导的大力支持和帮助。
    ——各级森林病虫害防治机构要做好技术指导和技术服务工作，采取各种办法控制病虫害的蔓延。
    ——要管好用好中央和地方拨给的救灾补助款，把有限的钱用在病虫害最严重的地方，取得最好的防治效果。
