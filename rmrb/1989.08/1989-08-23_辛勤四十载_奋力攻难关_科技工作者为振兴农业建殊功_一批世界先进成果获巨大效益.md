In the 40 years since the founding of New China, a vast number of agricultural scientists have bravely scaled new heights and tackled difficult problems, achieving a series of major scientific research results in the fields of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries that are on par with or even surpass international advanced levels. They have elevated scientific farming to a new level, making tremendous contributions to the revitalization of China's agriculture.

Following China's pioneering work in the world to breed and promote dwarf rice varieties, the National Hybrid Rice Research Cooperation Group launched a collaborative study on japonica hybrid rice in the early 1970s. In 1973, they broke through technical barriers and developed the world's first japonica hybrid rice, opening up new avenues for significantly increasing rice yields. This new variety increased yields by 20 to 30 percent per acre compared to conventional rice varieties, with some achieving over 50 percent increases. From 1976 to 1988, hybrid rice was promoted over 12 billion acres, increasing rice production by over 60 billion kilograms. China also transferred this technology as its first agricultural patent to the United States, earning the country honor.

According to incomplete statistics, from 1949 to 1985, the country bred over 3,400 varieties of 40 different crops, which have been widely used in production. In the first three years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," 200 high-quality new varieties and hybrid combinations were developed, which were promoted over 140 million acres from 1986 to 1988, increasing grain production by 2.8 billion kilograms, cotton production by 25 million kilograms, and adding 1.46 billion yuan in production value.

China has developed a relatively complete and effective set of comprehensive prevention and control measures for diseases and pests affecting wheat, rice, corn, cotton, and other crops, effectively controlling 25 major crop diseases and pests nationwide. Comprehensive and individual prevention and control measures for various crop diseases and pests save approximately 25 billion kilograms of grain annually.

Equine infectious anemia causes rapid transmission and high mortality rates in horse populations. This disease has been spreading worldwide for over 130 years and is referred to by foreigners as "horse cancer." In the 1970s, Chinese veterinary scientists developed the world's first attenuated vaccine for equine infectious anemia. After promotion and application, this disease was quickly controlled in China. The vaccine achieves an 85 percent immunity rate in horses, with immunity lasting over three years. Foreign scientists have commented that this is a "remarkable contribution" by Chinese agricultural scientists. Additionally, China has developed approximately 60 safe and effective attenuated vaccines and bacteria, controlling or eradicating several malignant infectious diseases in livestock and poultry. Among them, the attenuated vaccines for rinderpest, swine fever, and bovine pleuropneumonia have reached world-class advanced levels.

In the 1980s, China bred a batch of fast-growing, high-feed-efficiency lean-type pigs, with a carcass lean meat rate of over 56 percent, and major production indicators reaching domestic advanced levels, with some approaching international advanced levels. For example, the carcass lean meat rate of Hubei white pigs reaches 60 percent at 90 kilograms. Black and white dairy cows bred using frozen semen technology have high-yield core herds that have entered the international advanced ranks. Currently, the number of high-quality black and white dairy cows nationwide has reached 1.2 million, including 700,000 adult cows, with an annual total milk production of 2.8 million tons.

Advances in aquaculture technology have solved many production-related technical challenges, significantly increasing China's aquatic product output to the third-highest in the world. Breeding technology is at the forefront globally, and aquaculture production is the highest in the world.

After more than 30 years of research and production practice, Chinese scientists have developed a set of rubber tapping technologies suitable for China's national conditions. They have successfully established natural rubber bases in the 18 to 24 degrees north latitude region, with Hainan Island and Xishuangbanna as the main bodies, a feat rarely seen in the world. Currently, China's rubber plantation area is 8.6 million acres, producing 240,000 tons of dry rubber annually, ranking fourth in the world in terms of rubber plantation area and dry rubber production.

    辛勤四十载　奋力攻难关
    科技工作者为振兴农业建殊功
    一批世界先进成果获巨大效益
    据新华社北京8月23日电　（记者余富棠）新中国成立40年来，广大农业科技工作者勇攀高峰，猛攻难关，在农林牧副渔各个领域获得一批接近或达到国际先进水平的重大科研成果，把科学种田提高到一个新水平，为振兴我国农业作出了巨大贡献。
    继我国在世界上最早选育和推广矮秆稻种之后，70年代初期，由全国杂交水稻科研协作组开展的籼型杂交水稻协作研究，1973年突破技术难关，培育出世界上第一个籼型杂交水稻，为大幅度提高水稻产量开辟了新途径。这一新品种比水稻常规品种每亩增产二至三成，高的达五成以上。从1976年至1988年，全国推广杂交水稻面积12亿多亩，增产稻谷600亿公斤以上，并以我国第一项农业技术专利转让美国，为国家赢得了荣誉。
    据不完全统计，1949年至1985年，全国培育出40多种作物的3400多个品种，已广泛用于生产。“七五”头3年攻关中育出的200个优质新品种及杂交组合，1986年至1988年已推广1.4亿亩，增产粮食28亿公斤，成棉2500万公斤，增加产值14.6亿元。
    我国在防治小麦、水稻、玉米、棉花等作物病虫害上，总结出一套较完整有效的综合防治技术措施，基本控制了全国25种主要农作物病虫害。各种农作物病虫害的单项和综合防治，每年挽回粮食损失约250亿公斤。
    马传染性贫血病造成马群传染快，死亡率高。此病在世界上传播达130年之久，被外国人称之为“马的癌症”。70年代，我国兽医科学工作者在国际上首次研制出马传贫弱毒疫苗，经过推广运用后在我国很快控制了这种疫病，使用这种疫苗，对马的免疫率达85％，免疫期可持续3年以上，外国科学家评论这是中国农业科学家“卓有成效的贡献”。此外，我国先后研制出约60种安全有效的弱毒疫（菌）苗，控制或消灭了一些家畜家禽的恶性传染病，其中牛瘟、猪瘟、牛肺疫等弱毒疫苗，均达到世界先进水平。
    80年代，我国选育出一批生长快、饲料报酬高的瘦肉型猪，胴体瘦肉率达56％以上，主要生产指标达国内先进水平，有的已接近世界先进水平。如湖北白猪90公斤时屠宰胴体瘦肉率达60％。采用冷冻精液技术培育的中国黑白花奶牛，高产核心牛群的质量进入国际先进行列。目前黑白花奶牛的良种牛全国发展到120万头，其中成年牛70万头，年总产奶量280万吨。
    水产科技的进步，解决了许多生产上的技术关键，使我国水产品产量大幅度增长，居世界第三位。育苗技术处于世界领先地位，养殖产量居世界首位。
    我国科学工作者经过30多年的研究和生产实践，摸索出一套适合我国国情的植胶技术，终于在北纬18至24度的地带，建成以海南岛、西双版纳为主体的天然橡胶基地，实为世界所鲜见。目前，我国胶园面积达860万亩，年产干胶24万吨，植胶面积和干胶产量跃居世界第四位。
