Lu Chengde, a member of the Communist Party, retired and signed a contract with relevant departments to take over the barren mountains. In October 1984, he ascended to the peak of Swan Pool. With just an old pair of hands, he hacked through the undergrowth, living and eating in the deep mountains. Over the years, he has planted trees on 700 acres of land and built three brick houses in Swan Pool.

Last year, the county forestry department inspected his work, and all the trees he planted passed the inspection. Inspired by him, some villagers also came to Swan Pool and planted trees on more than 1,000 acres of land. Now, the long-abandoned Swan Pool has been covered in green.

    卢成德潜心植树  天鹅池郁郁葱葱
    我县沙河乡沙河村天鹅池地处偏僻深山，海拔800米，山势险峻。过去，乡里先后5次办集体林场，均告失败。
    共产党员卢成德退休后，与有关部门签订了承包荒山的合同，于1984年10月上了天鹅池峰巅。他凭着一双老手，披荆斩棘，吃住在深山，几年来造林700亩，还在天鹅池建造了3间瓦房。
    去年，经县林业部门验收，他造的林全部合格。在他的带动下，一些村民也来到天鹅池，造林1000多亩。现在，多年荒芜的天鹅池已披上了绿装。
