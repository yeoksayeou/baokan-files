The recent meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee discussed and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Several Matters of Concern to the People in the Near Future." This "Decision" has attracted widespread attention both domestically and internationally, and has been wholeheartedly supported by the entire Party and the people of the nation.

The Party Central Committee and the State Council have decided to focus on seven key areas in the near future: further cleaning up and rectifying companies; resolutely stopping the children of high-ranking officials from engaging in business; canceling the special provisions for leaders' small amounts of food; strictly following regulations for vehicle allocation and strictly prohibiting the import of small cars; strictly prohibiting banquets and gifts; strictly controlling the number of officials traveling abroad; and seriously and thoroughly investigating cases of embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and other crimes, particularly focusing on major cases. These measures all point to one goal: to strengthen the building of a clean government and resolutely combat corruption. The significance of this "Decision" lies in the fact that it addresses several issues that have been widely discussed and have garnered the most criticism within and outside the Party, providing clear and specific regulations for each. Additionally, it emphasizes that the initiative must start with the members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, the Secretariat, and the members of the Standing Committee of the State Council. This not only demonstrates the Party Central Committee and the State Council's determination to strengthen the building of a clean government but also reflects the strong aspirations of the broad masses of cadres and the people.

Strengthening the building of a clean government is not a casual requirement but is determined by the nature of our Party and government and the characteristics of the historical period in which we find ourselves. Our Party is a Party that serves the people, not one that seeks personal gain; our government is a government that serves the people, not one that seeks personal gain. This requires that the Party and government must be clean and upright. Our Party is in a position of leadership and is leading the reform and opening-up cause, making it extremely important and arduous to resist the infiltration of various negative and corrupt ideologies and work styles. For this reason, in the new historical period, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly reminded the entire Party, especially the leading cadres at all levels, to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and close ties with the masses. As early as 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his report "Senior Cadres Must Take the Lead in Carrying Forward the Party's Fine Traditions," proposed: "We must restore and carry forward the Party's fine traditions of hard work, simplicity, and close ties with the masses"; we must oppose the special privileges of cadres; "To rectify the Party's style and improve the social customs, we must start with the senior cadres." The 13th Party Congress summarized the experiences of the reform and opening-up, clearly proposing that in the primary stage of socialism, we must govern the Party strictly and combat corruption. The State Council has also clearly put forward the requirement for clean governance to all levels of government.

However, it must be admitted that over a period of time, while there have been some advances in the building of a clean government, overall, there has been more talk than action, and the measures have not been forceful enough. As a result, in some Party and government organs and among some leading cadres, the winds of using power for personal gain, embezzlement, bribery, and speculation have become increasingly rampant, sparking strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses of cadres and the people, severely damaging the prestige of the Party and government, harming the ties between the Party and government and the people, and dampening the enthusiasm of the people for building socialism.

The winds of corruption have also given those who advocate bourgeois liberalization an opportunity to exploit. During the recent turmoil and rebellion, didn't they use the slogan of anti-corruption to stir up the hearts of the people? Originally, clean governance and the fight against corruption were initiatives put forward by our Party and government. However, due to the lack of resolute and effective implementation, they took advantage of this loophole, seized the slogan, and shouted it loudly, as if only they were the true fighters against corruption, deceiving many people. This serious lesson must be deeply remembered. Strengthening the building of a clean government and combating corrupt practices is not just a matter of the image of the Party and government; it is a major issue concerning whether we can unite and educate the broad masses of cadres and the people to carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization to the end and whether we can ensure the healthy development of the cause of reform and opening-up. This cannot be taken lightly.

Bad habits are hard to change, and deep-seated problems are hard to eradicate. The seven key areas that the Party Central Committee and the State Council have decided to focus on in the near future will inevitably touch the vested interests of some people. Therefore, their implementation will not be smooth sailing and will inevitably encounter various obstacles and difficulties. At present, many comrades, reflecting on the lessons of the repeated efforts to rectify the Party's style and punish corruption over the past few years, still lack confidence and want to wait and see. This is understandable. However, we believe that the new leadership core produced by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, by clearly announcing to the entire Party and the people of the nation the seven key areas to focus on in the near future, has shown that this leadership core has the resolve and ability to grasp, implement, and achieve results in these seven areas, thereby winning the trust of the people. We are full of confidence in this.

The announcement of the "seven key areas" marks a new step in our Party and government's efforts to combat corruption and promote integrity. Since the publication of the Political Bureau's "Decision," Party and government organs at various levels have seriously studied and resolutely implemented it, putting forward requirements for the building of a clean government in combination with local realities. This momentum is good. Leading cadres at all levels must fully recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the building of a clean government. On one hand, they must resolutely overcome the passive attitudes of waiting and seeing and the bad habit of saying one thing and doing another. On the other hand, they must also guard against the bad tendencies of being a flash in the pan and going through the motions, setting an example by leading from the front, and ensuring that the decided matters are implemented item by item. They must take concrete actions to promote the building of a clean government in their local areas, departments, and units.

### 廉政建设的新起点

    廉政建设的新起点
    最近，中共中央政治局全体会议讨论并通过了《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》。这个《决定》引起国内外的广泛重视，得到全党和全国人民的衷心拥护。
    党中央、国务院决定近期要做的七件事——进一步清理整顿公司；坚决制止高干子女经商；取消对领导同志少量食品的“特供”；严格按规定配车，严格禁止进口小轿车；严格禁止请客送礼；严格控制领导干部出国；严肃认真地查处贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪案件，特别要抓紧查处大案要案——集中到一点，就是要加强廉政建设，坚决反对腐败。它的引人注目之处，其一在于几年来党内外同志对廉政建设方面议论最多、意见最大的几个问题，在这个《决定》中都得到了反映，都做了明确、具体的规定；其二在于强调首先要从中央政治局、书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员做起。这不但昭示了党中央、国务院加强廉政建设的决心，也集中反映了广大干部和群众的强烈愿望。
    加强廉政建设，不是随便提出的一项要求，而是由我们党的性质、政府的性质决定的，是由我们所处的历史时期的特点决定的。我们的党是为人民服务的党，而不是谋私利的党；我们的政府是为人民服务的政府，而不是谋私利的政府，这就要求党和政府必须是清正廉洁的。我们党处于执政地位，又在领导改革开放事业，因而抵制种种消极腐败思想作风的侵蚀就变得极为重要、极为艰巨。也正因为如此，在历史发展的新时期，党中央一再告诫全党同志特别是各级领导干部，要发扬艰苦创业的好传统，密切联系群众。早在1979年，邓小平同志在《高级干部要带头发扬党的优良传统》的报告中就提出：“必须恢复和发扬党的艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良传统”；要反对干部特殊化；“为了整顿党风，搞好民风，先要从我们高级干部整起”。党的十三大总结了改革开放以来的经验，明确提出，在社会主义初级阶段必须从严治党，反对腐败。国务院也向各级政府明确提出为政清廉的要求。
    但是，应该承认，一个时期以来，在廉政建设方面，虽然不能说没有进展，然而总的看来是说的多，做的少，措施不够有力，结果在某些党政机关和领导干部身上，以权谋私，贪污、受贿、倒买倒卖等腐败之风愈演愈烈，激起广大干部和群众的强烈不满，极大地损害了党和政府的威信，损害了党和政府同人民群众的联系，挫伤了人民群众建设社会主义的积极性。
    腐败之风也给那些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人以可乘之机。在前一段的动乱和暴乱中，他们不就是以反腐败的口号作为陪衬来激动人心吗？本来，为政清廉、反对腐败，是我们党和政府提出来的，但是由于实际执行得不坚决、不得力，被他们钻了空子，把这个口号接过去喊得震天响，似乎只有他们才是真正反腐败的，迷惑了不少群众。这个严重的教训，值得牢牢记取。加强廉政建设，反对腐败作风，不仅仅是个党和政府的形象问题，也是关系到能否团结教育广大干部群众，把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争进行到底的大问题，是关系到能否使改革开放的事业健康发展的大问题，绝不能等闲视之。
  积习难改，积弊难除。党中央、国务院决定近期要做的七件事，必然触动某些人的既得利益，因此，它在贯彻执行中不会一帆风顺，必然会遇到种种阻力，必然要克服许多困难。现在，相当一部分同志鉴于几年来端正党风、惩治腐败的努力几起几落的教训，还有些信心不足，还要再看一看，这是可以理解的。但是我们相信，党的十三届四中全会产生的新的中央领导核心既然敢于明确地向全党和全国人民公布近期要做的七件事，就表明这个领导核心是有决心、有能力把这七件事抓紧、抓好、抓出成效，以取信于民的。我们对此充满了信心。
    宣布做“七件事”，标志着我们党和政府迈出了反腐倡廉的新步子。中央政治局的《决定》发表以来，各地党政机关认真学习，坚决贯彻，纷纷结合当地实际，提出廉政建设的要求。这个势头是好的。各级领导干部要充分认识廉政建设的长期性和艰巨性，一方面坚决克服等待观望的消极情绪和言行不一的恶习，另一方面也要防止一阵风、走过场等不良倾向，以身作则，率先垂范，把决定了的事情条条落实，把本地、本部门、本单位的廉政建设切切实实抓起来。
