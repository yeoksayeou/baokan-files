Lack of experience in international competitions, especially against the European powerhouses, is the biggest weakness currently facing China's men's and women's handball teams.

This is the consensus view of several head coaches from strong teams participating in the Asian Handball Championships and international referees.

The South Korean men's team coach, Kim Gap-gyeong, who is usually stern-faced on the court, smiled and candidly analyzed, "The Chinese men's team is still young and lacks competition experience. Additionally, their speed and cutting-in abilities are not yet up to par. In the future, they need to improve their individual and collective coordination."

The coach of the Qatar team, Abbas (a Yugoslavian who led the Yugoslavian team to third place in the Seoul Olympics last year), pointed out, "The Chinese team has good physical conditioning, but to achieve results, they need to participate in more international competitions, at least going to Europe to compete once a year."

The international A-level referee from Denmark, Jorgen Jensen, and the coach of the Chinese Taipei men's team, Su Jiao-yuan, also pointed out from different angles that the Chinese team lacks competition experience and needs to pay attention to training methods.

When discussing the Chinese women's team, the coach of the Japanese women's team, Kakioka Toshiyuki, did not want to "expose" their weaknesses, repeatedly praising the Chinese team. When asked by the reporter about the shortcomings of the Chinese team compared to the world powerhouse South Korea, he paused and replied, "The Chinese team has a short training time, and their experience and speed are not as good as their opponents."

The coach of the South Korean women's team, Park Jeong-gu, frankly said, "Although the Chinese women's team has more strength and endurance than us, their speed is slow, the team's level is uneven, and their tactics are monotonous. They need to compete more with European powerhouses to accumulate experience."

The coach of the Chinese Taipei women's team, Lin Zhongxiong, pointed out that the Chinese women's team still has some "immature" aspects in terms of technique and experience.

The reporter believes that in the future, the Chinese team should focus more on mental and willpower training, cherishing and seriously playing every match. For example, in this championship, the Chinese women's team, when facing the slightly weaker Chinese Taipei team, fell behind in the first half due to "underestimating the opponent." In the second half, the Chinese team found the cause and did not allow the opponent to score for 15 minutes.

    “病因”在哪里
    ——专家“会诊”中国男、女手球队
    缺乏国际比赛经验，特别是同欧洲诸强比赛的经验，是中国男、女手球队目前存在的最大弱点。
    这是参加亚洲手球锦标赛几个强队主教练及国际裁判的一致看法。
    赛场上总板着面孔的南朝鲜男队主教练金甲经，带着微笑对记者直言分析说：“中国男队还年轻，缺乏比赛经验。此外，中国队速度和切入能力还欠火候。今后需提高个人和集体配合的能力。”
    卡塔尔队主教练阿巴斯（南斯拉夫人，去年率南斯拉夫队获汉城奥运会第三名）指出：“中国队身体素质不错，但要出成绩，还需多参加国际比赛，至少每年应去欧洲参赛一次。”
    国际A级裁判、丹麦的乔尔根森和中国台北队男队主教练苏肇元也从不同角度指出了中国队缺少比赛经验，今后应注意训练方法的问题。
    谈及中国女队时，日本女队主教练梶冈俊介则不愿“揭底”，只是一再夸赞中国队。当记者请他谈谈中国队与世界强队南朝鲜相比有何不足时，他顿了顿答道：“中国队训练时间短，经验和速度不如对手。”
    南朝鲜女队主教练朴正求坦率地说：“尽管中国女队力量、体力比我们强，但速度慢，全队水平参差不一，打法单调。还需多与欧洲强队交手，以积累经验。”
    中国台北女队主教练林忠雄指出，中国女队在技术和经验上还有“火候未到”之处。
    记者认为，中国队今后应在心理和意志上多加磨练，珍惜和认真打好每一场比赛。如此次锦标赛中国女队与实力略逊一筹的中国台北队交手时，上半场由于“轻敌”，比分一直落后，下半场中国队找到了原因，竟有15分钟未让对手拿分。　　　　　新华社记者　梁金雄
