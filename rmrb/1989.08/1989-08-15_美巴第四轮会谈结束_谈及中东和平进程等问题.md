The fourth round of talks between Palestine and the United States concluded this afternoon in Carthage, north of Tunis. The two sides held over three hours of secret discussions on the Middle East peace process and Israel's proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories.

After the talks, the head of the Palestinian delegation, Abed Rabbo, a member of the PLO Executive Committee, and the head of the U.S. delegation, U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia Robert Pelletreau, spoke to the press.

Abed Rabbo said that both sides exchanged views on the Middle East peace process and agreed to hold another round of talks in the near future. He stated, "Holding elections in the occupied territories is not the basis for a political solution to the Palestinian issue." Only "Israel ending its illegal occupation of Arab territories and recognizing the Palestinian people's right to self-determination" can ultimately resolve the Palestinian issue. He urged the U.S. government to take "serious and effective" measures on this basis.

Pelletreau expressed his continued efforts to "seek feasible ways" to advance the Middle East peace process. He reiterated the U.S. stance on the Middle East issue.

    美巴第四轮会谈结束
    谈及中东和平进程等问题
    新华社突尼斯8月14日电　巴勒斯坦和美国的第4轮会谈14日下午在突尼斯城北郊的迦太基结束，双方就中东和平进程问题和以色列提出的在被占领土举行选举计划进行了3个多小时的秘密会谈。
    巴勒斯坦代表团团长、巴解组织执委会成员阿布德·拉布和美国代表团团长、美国驻突尼斯大使罗伯特·佩利特鲁在会谈后向报界发表了谈话。
    阿布德·拉布说，双方就中东和平进程问题交换了意见，并决定美巴不久将举行下一轮会谈。他说，“在被占领土举行选举并不是政治解决巴勒斯坦问题的基础。”只有“以色列结束其非法占领阿拉伯领土和承认巴勒斯坦人民的民族自决权利”才能最终解决巴勒斯坦问题。他呼吁美国政府在此基础上采取“认真和有效”的措施。
    佩利特鲁表示将继续努力“寻求可行的办法”推进中东的和平进程。他再次强调了美国对中东问题的立场。
