The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting at midnight today and unanimously adopted a statement, firmly demanding that all parties involved in the Lebanese crisis immediately cease all military actions, including all land and sea-based shooting and shelling.

The Security Council also urged all relevant parties to make every effort to consolidate the ceasefire, open all routes, and lift the curfew.

This meeting was convened at the urgent request of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, aiming to promote a peaceful resolution to the Lebanese issue.

De Cuéllar believes that the current Lebanese crisis poses a serious threat to international peace and security.

The statement said, "The Security Council is deeply concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, is disappointed by the intensification of bombings and the fierce confrontations that have occurred in recent days, and is deeply saddened by the suffering and casualties endured by the Lebanese people."

The statement pointed out, "The Security Council fully supports the actions taken by the three-party committee of Arab heads of state to end the suffering of the Lebanese people, achieve an effective and comprehensive ceasefire, and implement a comprehensive plan to resolve the Lebanese crisis, ensuring Lebanon's full sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and national unity."

The Security Council also called on relevant countries and parties to similarly support the actions of the three-party committee.
