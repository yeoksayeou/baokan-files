The Chinese Association for Ethnic Trade and Economy and the Hunan Association for Ethnic Trade and Economy held a joint seminar in Jishou, Hunan, to discuss how to narrow the economic development gap between ethnic minority areas and general areas.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the economic strength of ethnic autonomous regions has significantly increased. In 1987, the total industrial and agricultural output value of all ethnic autonomous regions in the country was more than 18 times that of 1949, with agriculture increasing by 4.9 times and industry by 100 times. Based on this economic development, people's living standards have also improved significantly. In 1987, the total retail sales of social consumer goods in all ethnic autonomous regions in the country were 54 times that of 1949.

However, due to historical, social, and natural factors, the economic development of ethnic autonomous regions is significantly lower than the national average. Compared to the economically developed coastal regions and the national average development level, the economic development gap is not narrowing but continues to widen. In 1987, the per capita industrial and agricultural output value of all ethnic autonomous regions in the country was only 47.9% of the national per capita industrial and agricultural output value; the per capita retail sales of social consumer goods were only 69.2% of the national per capita figure; the per capita grain production was 72 kilograms less than the national average, and the yield per unit area was 64.5 kilograms less than the national average. Most of the low-yield and grain-deficient areas in the country are located in ethnic minority regions.

The economic backwardness of ethnic minority regions is mainly reflected in the underdevelopment of the commodity economy. Due to factors such as low productivity, irrational industrial structure, backward science and technology, slow development of various economic components, poor economic efficiency, deteriorating ecological environment, and insufficient improvement in the investment environment, the economic development gap with inland regions has been created.

How to narrow the economic development gap between ethnic minority areas and general areas? It is believed that it is necessary to adopt corresponding policies, measures, and guidelines based on the objective conditions of ethnic minority areas, market needs, and the overall requirements of the national economy:

1. To adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, and vigorously develop the commodity economy. It is necessary to introduce the competitive mechanism according to the requirements of the commodity economy. Whether it is industrial, agricultural, or pastoral production, whether it is commerce or service industry, and whether it is new or old enterprises, reform should rely on technological progress, strengthen management, improve quality, and enhance the efficiency of capital use and resource utilization to achieve stable economic growth.

2. The state should provide ethnic minority areas with relatively favorable policies to promote faster economic development.

3. To leverage strengths and avoid weaknesses, and strive to develop economic advantages. Ethnic minority regions, on the one hand, have underdeveloped commodity economies, and on the other hand, have advantages for developing commodity economies. Ethnic minority regions have abundant natural resources. With appropriate policies and measures, resource advantages can gradually be transformed into commodity advantages, making poor ethnic minority regions gradually prosperous.

4. To develop science and technology, improve scientific and technological levels, and vigorously cultivate talents in various fields. Currently, ethnic minority regions have a high illiteracy rate, low scientific and cultural knowledge levels, and poor labor quality. Many resources cannot be fully developed and utilized, many scientific and technological achievements cannot be transformed into productive forces, and many equipment cannot produce the expected economic benefits. Therefore, to revitalize the economy of ethnic minority regions, it is necessary to prioritize the development of science and technology, cultural knowledge education, and talent cultivation. Specific measures should be further adopted.

    如何缩小民族地区与一般地区经济发展的差距？
    中国民族贸易经济研究会同湖南省民族贸易经济研究会在湖南吉首市联合举行研讨会，讨论了如何缩小民族地区与一般地区经济发展的差距问题。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，各民族自治地方经济实力有了较大的增强。1987年，全国民族自治地方工农业生产总值比1949年增长18倍多，其中，农业增长4.9倍，工业增长100倍。在生产发展的基础上，人民生活也有了较大改善。1987年全国民族自治地方社会商品零售总额比1949年增长54倍。
    但是，由于历史、社会、自然方面的原因，民族自治地方经济发展明显低于全国平均水平，同经济发达的沿海地区比较，同全国平均发展水平比较，经济发展差距不是缩小了，而是继续在扩大。1987年，全国民族自治地方人均工农业总产值，只相当于全国人均工农业总产值的47.9％；人均社会商品零售额，只相当全国人均数的69.2％；人均粮食比全国人均数少72公斤，单产比全国单产少64.5公斤。全国粮食低产区和缺粮区主要分布在民族地区。
    民族地区经济滞后，集中表现是商品经济不发达。由于民族地区生产力水平低、产业结构不合理、科学技术落后、多种经济成份发展不快、经济效益差、生态环境逐步恶化以及投资环境改善不大等因素，造成了与内地经济发展的差距。
    如何缩小民族地区与一般地区经济发展的差距呢？大家认为，必须根据民族地区的客观条件和市场需要以及整个国民经济的要求采取相应的方针、政策和措施：（一）要坚持改革开放，大力发展商品经济。要按照商品经济的要求，引进竞争机制。无论是工、农、牧业生产，无论是商业、服务业，也无论是新老企业，改革中都要依靠技术进步，加强经营管理，提高质量，提高资金使用效益和资源利用效益，使经济稳定增长。（二）国家要给民族地区较宽一些的优惠政策，使民族地区经济得到更快的发展。（三）要扬长避短，努力发挥经济优势。民族地区一方面是商品经济不发达，另一方面是有发展商品经济的优势。民族地区有着丰富的自然资源，只要政策措施得当，就能逐步把资源优势变为商品优势，使贫困的民族地区逐步富裕起来。（四）要发展科学技术，提高科技水平，大力培养各方面的人才。目前民族地区文盲多，科学文化知识水平低，劳动力素质差，许多资源不能充分开发和利用，许多科学技术成果不能转化为生产力，许多设备不能产生应有的经济效益。因此，要使民族地区经济振兴，必须把发展科学技术和文化知识教育、培养人才放在重要位置，要进一步采取具体措施。　（苏学生）
