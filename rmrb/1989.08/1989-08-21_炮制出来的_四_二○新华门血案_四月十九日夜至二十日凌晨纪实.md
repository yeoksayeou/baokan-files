On the night of April 18th to the early morning of April 19th, after Wang Dan and others submitted a petition to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, they also stormed the New China Gate, the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Although Li Shuhuan had previously instructed Wang Dan: "Go to New China Gate and sit in, and if necessary, push your way in. As long as the police dare to intervene, it's beating. This can arouse the sympathy of fellow students." However, as soon as the public security personnel appeared, the crowd quickly dispersed. The plot by the planners and organizers of the turmoil to create a bloody conflict did not succeed.

However, they were not willing to give up. Although they had not yet thought of any new petition demands in the name of the students, nor found any reason to negotiate with the State Council, on the night of the 19th to the early morning of the 20th, they incited and directed some students in Beijing and people from society to storm New China Gate again. They fabricated a so-called "April 20th New China Gate Bloodshed" that never happened, escalating the turmoil once more.

On the evening of the 19th, at the 16th "Democracy Salon" held by Wang Dan and others at Beijing University's Triangle Field, they revealed their determination to fight the Party and the government to the end. They proposed that the newly established "Beijing University United Students' Association Preparatory Committee" should learn from the previous actions of "no organization, no platform, no slogans," and lead all student movements before May 4th. A student even conveyed Jin Guantao's opinion on the spot: "The current situation is very favorable for us. Tsinghua University and Beijing University should unite." Some people also proposed to implement Yan Jiaqi's idea: "Bloodshed can advance the process of democratization."

At the same time, some "activists" were stirring up another frenzy at New China Gate.

That night around 9 PM, thousands of students gathered at New China Gate again. Although some students tried their best to ask people to sit down, about half an hour later, some people began to organize an attack on New China Gate. The on-duty soldiers formed several human walls, stubbornly blocking the surging crowd.

Around midnight, the frenzied attack reached its peak. The dense crowd surged forward wave after wave towards the New China Gate entrance, the guard line in front of the gate was repeatedly pushed into an "S" shape, and the soldiers' uniforms were soaked with sweat. At this time, a rumor spread in the crowd: "The top leaders are on the second floor of New China Gate. If things get really bad, they will come down to talk to the students." The attackers became even more violent, throwing bottles, shoes, stones, and even wreaths at the guards. Someone waved their fists and shouted repeatedly: "Li Peng, come out!" Someone cursed the guards: "Get out of the way, slave!" Others shouted without reason: "Don't hit people!" At this time, some foreign journalists climbed onto the base of the national flagpole in front of New China Gate, taking photos and recording sounds. A tall and thin foreign journalist even shouted "OK!" repeatedly.

After about 40 minutes of chaos, the crowd attacking New China Gate became tired, and some students sat down. Wu'erkaixi and others then stood up to incite and cheer, shouting slogans like "So-and-so get out!" and spreading malicious curses against the Party and state leaders.

This savage attack on the Party Central Committee and the State Council headquarters is something that did not even happen during the Cultural Revolution. To prevent the situation from escalating further, at 2:30 AM on the 20th, the public security bureau's broadcast car began broadcasting the Beijing Municipal Government's notice on the east side of Chang'an Street in front of New China Gate, ordering people to leave immediately. The police also began to clear the street.

By 4 AM, more than 100 students were still sitting in front of New China Gate and refused to leave. After repeated persuasion by the public security bureau and some school leaders, some students stood up to leave, but someone immediately threatened: "Whoever leaves is a traitor!" The students who wanted to leave sat down again, frightened.

At 4:50 AM, some public buses in the city were about to start on time, but these more than 100 students still refused to leave, and traffic was in danger of being blocked. Therefore, the unarmed public security officers stopped some students from pushing and pulling to resist, and forcibly carried them onto the public buses.

After the students got on the bus, they continued to shout wildly, broke the car windows, and some students scratched their arms. Wu'erkaixi stuck his head out of the window and shouted and cursed at the police. A female student shouted: "Down with the Communist Party!" At this time, a staff member on the scene immediately boarded the bus and said sternly: "I heard that female student shout 'Down with the Communist Party.' What kind of issue is this!" Hearing this stern voice and seeing four police officers also board the bus, the students finally quieted down. The driver then drove the bus out of the New China Gate area.

On the early morning of the 20th, except for a few students who scratched their arms when they broke the car windows, there was no bloodshed incident in front of New China Gate.

Afterwards, foreign media reported on this matter, saying that the police had adopted an extremely restrained attitude. Some reports even said that seeing such a thing happen in front of the New China Gate, which would never happen in front of the White House in the United States, "felt very shocked." Even the most rumor-mongering "Voice of America" could only say: "Students claimed that more than 200 people were beaten by the police. However, the reporter only saw dozens of people being pushed and beaten. Students said that more than 40 people were detained, but the reporter did not get official confirmation."

However, in the campuses of some universities in the capital, the shocking rumor of the so-called "April 20th New China Gate Bloodshed" immediately spread.

At around 5 AM on the 20th, the bus that forcibly took the students away from New China Gate arrived at the South Gate of Beijing University. The students who had stormed New China Gate immediately rushed to the Triangle Field of Beijing University, where someone gave a speech about "blood flowing like a river in front of New China Gate," someone even showed what was claimed to be "blood-stained clothes," and someone shouted the slogan "avenge the blood debt." Beijing University posted more than ten large and small wall posters that day, "condemning the government's atrocities," one of which, titled "Fascist Suppression," fabricated lies vividly: "A large number of public security police suddenly appeared, pushing away the unarmed crowd, shouting 'beat them to death, beat them to death.' The police specifically beat the back of the head, waist, kidneys, chest, and other vital parts."

At 7 AM, at the gate of Beijing Normal University, after a few students discussed the arrangements for the march on the 22nd, a student began to speak to passersby: "Last night, the police beat people at New China Gate, not only students but also the elderly, women, and children. They beat from Xidan all the way to Wangfujing. It was ordered from above."

In Renmin University, Tsinghua University, and dozens of other universities, rumors spread such as "1,000 scientific and technological workers lay in a pool of blood," and "4 student representatives were detained." Malicious individuals, not satisfied with this, also fabricated the rumor that "the Communist Party's military vehicle ran over and killed a student" based on the fact that on the evening of April 19th, Guo Xiangdong, a female student from Beijing Normal University, died in a collision with a trolleybus on her way back from a performance.

Someone said that the planners of this turmoil were practicing "rumor politics." This is absolutely correct. It was these rumors that incited and provoked the opposition between young students and the government. The prominent content of the wall posters in Beijing universities on April 20th was to call on students to go on strike, march, participate in the "April 22nd Hu Yaobang Memorial Service." The "United Students' Association Preparatory Committee" of Beijing University posted a notice titled "To the Students of Beijing Universities," proposing that "the purpose of the recent petition activities is to advance China's democratization process, and the forms are marches, strikes, sit-ins, and hunger strikes." Wu'erkaixi openly incited at a student gathering at Beijing Normal University, "avenge the blood debt of April 20th," urging students to "go to Tiananmen Square tonight to continue the struggle." Li Shuhuan had already instructed: "The next step is to demand participation in the memorial service, and many people have this mindset. This way, the matter will be even bigger and can be pushed nationwide."

The planners of the turmoil fabricated a "April 20th Bloodshed" that did not actually happen, using the psychological weakness of university students who see themselves as "special citizens" to prepare public opinion for this "next step." They usually praise university students for being able to make "rational choices," but at this time, they need university students to lose their rationality and become fanatical. This is the need for the escalation of the turmoil. Two days later, a new trap was waiting for the university students in Beijing.

    炮制出来的“四·二○新华门血案”
    ——四月十九日夜至二十日凌晨纪实
    任玉清
    4月18日夜至19日凌晨，王丹等人向全国人大常委会递交请愿书后，又冲击了党中央国务院所在地新华门。虽然事先李淑娴曾向王丹授意过：“到新华门静坐，必要时往里挤，只要警察敢管，就是打人。这样能唤起同学的同情心。”但是公安人员一出现，人群很快就疏散了。动乱的策划者和组织者蓄意要制造流血冲突的阴谋没有得逞。
    但是，他们决不愿意就此罢休。虽然他们当时还想不出用大学生们的名义提出任何新的请愿要求，也找不到什么需要找国务院交涉的事由，然而，19日夜至20日凌晨，他们又煽动和指挥北京的一些大学生和社会上的人再次冲击新华门，以制造一个根本没有血案的所谓“4·20新华门血案”，再次将动乱引向升级。
    19日晚，王丹等人在北大三角地主持的第16次“民主沙龙”上，暴露了他们誓与党和政府斗到底的用心。他们提出，新成立的“北大团结学生会筹委会”要接受上次行动“没有组织、没有纲领、没有口号”等教训，领导“五四”以前的一切学生运动。一个学生还当场传达了金观涛的意见：“当前形势对我们非常有利。清华、北大要联合起来。”一些人还提出要用行动来实施严家其的观点：“流血可以推进民主化的进程。”
    与此同时，一些“行动者”则在新华门又掀起了一股狂潮。
    这天晚上21时许，数以千计的学生又一次向新华门聚集。尽管有的大学生竭力要求人们坐下，但大约半小时后，一些人便开始有组织地向新华门冲击。执勤官兵组成几道人墙，顽强地阻拦着洪水般涌来的人群。
    零点左右，疯狂的冲击达到高潮。黑压压的人群狂飙般地一次接一次地向新华门大门口逼进，门前的警戒线一次次地被撞成“S”型，警卫战士的军衣早已被汗水湿透。这时，一个谣言在人群中飞传：“中央的头儿就在新华门的二楼上，实在闹急了，就下来和学生们对话。”冲击者更加狂暴了，瓶子、鞋子、石块，还有花圈一齐抛向警卫战士。有人挥舞着拳头，不断高喊着：“李鹏出来！”有人辱骂警卫战士：“奴才滚开。”还有人无端地怪叫着：“不许打人！”此时，一些外国记者则爬到新华门前国旗旗杆的底座上，不断地拍照、录音。一个又高又瘦的外国记者还连声大喊“OK！”
    大约冲闹了40分钟后，冲击的人群疲惫了，一些学生坐了下来。吾尔开希等人便站出来进行煽动，打气，什么“××滚蛋”等语言不断地从他们嘴里迸出，恶毒咒骂党和国家领导人的顺口溜也不断流传。
    这种野蛮冲击党中央、国务院所在地的情形即使在“文化大革命”中也没有发生过。为了制止事态进一步扩大，20日凌晨2时30分，市公安局的宣传车开始在新华门东侧的长安街上广播北京市人民政府的通告，要求新华门前的人立即撤离，警察也开始对长安街进行清场。
    到凌晨4时，在新华门前静坐的100多名大学生仍坚持不走。在市公安局和一些学校领导的一再劝说下，有一些同学站起来想走，但马上有人威胁道：“谁走谁就是叛徒！”想离去的学生又怯生生地坐下了。
    4时50分，市内一些公共汽车即将按时发车，而这百余名大学生还是不肯离去，眼看交通就有阻塞的危险。于是，不带任何警械的公安干警们制止了有些大学生推搡拉扯的抵抗，强行架着他们上了公共汽车。
    学生们上车后仍在狂呼乱叫，还打碎了车窗玻璃，有的学生因此刮破了手臂。吾尔开希从车窗探出脑袋对着警察又叫又骂，一名女学生高喊：“打倒共产党。”这时，在现场的一名工作人员立刻登上汽车，严厉地说道：“我听见这个女生喊‘打倒共产党’。你们说，这是什么性质的问题！”听到这义正辞严的声音，又见有4名警察也上了车，学生们才安静下来。随后，司机将车驶出新华门地段。
    20日凌晨，新华门前除了个别学生打破车窗时手臂被划破外，根本没有发生什么流血事件。
    事后，外电在报道此事时都说，警方采取了极其克制的态度。有的报道还说，看到这种在美国白宫前都绝对不会发生的事情在新华门出现，“感到十分震惊”。就连最能造谣的“美国之音”也只能说：“学生宣称，200多人挨了警察的打。然而记者只看见几十人推打。学生说40多人被拘留，记者没有得到官方证实。”
    然而，在首都一些高校的校园里，却立即传出了耸人听闻的所谓“4·20新华门血案”的谣言。
    20日凌晨5时许，将学生们强行带离新华门的汽车开到北大南门后，冲击新华门的学生马上涌到了北大三角地，有人演讲“新华门前血流成河”，有人居然展示什么“血衣”，有人竟然呼喊出“讨还血债”的口号。北大当天就贴出十几张大小字报，“谴责政府暴行”，其中一张题为《法西斯的镇压》大字报竟把谎言编得绘声绘色：“大批公安警察突然出现，冲开手无寸铁的群众，大喊‘打死他们，往死里打’。警察专打后脑、腰、肾、胸和其他要害。”
    清晨7时，在北师大校门口，几名学生商议完22日游行事宜后，一个学生便向行人演讲：“昨晚警察在新华门打人了，不光打学生，还打了老人、女人和孩子。从西单一直打到王府井，是上头让他们干的。”
    在人大、清华等数十所高校还出现了“1000名科技工作者倒在血泊中”、“4名学生代表被扣留”等弥天大谎。别有用心的人还嫌不够，又抓住4月19日晚北师大女生郭向东看演出归来，与无轨电车相撞致死一事，无中生有地造出了“共产党的军车轧死了学生”的谣言。
    有人说，这场动乱的策划者搞的是“谣言政治”。一点也不错，正是这一个个谣言的蛊惑和挑唆，大大激化了青年学生同政府的对立情绪。4月20日北京高校大字报的一个突出内容就是号召学生们罢课，游行，参加“4·22”胡耀邦同志追悼会。北大“团结学生会筹委会”贴出了《告北京高校书》，提出“近期请愿活动的目的是推进中国民主化进程，其形式是游行、罢课、静坐、绝食”。吾尔开希则在北师大学生集会上公开叫嚣“偿还4·20血债”，鼓动学生21日晚“到天安门广场去，继续斗争。”李淑娴则早就指示：“下一步要求参加追悼会，很多人都有这种心理。这样事情就更大了，还能推向全国。”
    动乱的策划者们制造一个实际上没有发生过的“4·20血案”，就是利用大学生自视“特殊公民”的心理弱点，为这个“下一步”作舆论准备。他们平日吹捧大学生能够作出“理智的抉择”，但是这时，他们需要的却是大学生失去理智的狂热。这是动乱升级的需要。两天之后，“下一步”——一个新的圈套正在等着北京的大学生呢。
