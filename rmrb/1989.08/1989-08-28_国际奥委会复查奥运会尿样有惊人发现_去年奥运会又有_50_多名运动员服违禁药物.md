The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has uncovered a shocking revelation through the reexamination of urine samples from the Olympic Games. It has been discovered that over 50 athletes who participated in last year's Summer Olympics had used banned anabolic steroids.

The New China News Agency reported from Washington, D.C., on August 27 that the scandal involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson and nine other athletes who were found to have used banned substances during the Seoul Olympics has not yet subsided. The IOC recently disclosed an even bigger scandal: after reexamining the urine samples, it was found that over 50 athletes who participated in last year's Summer Olympics had used banned anabolic steroids.

On August 25, Prince Alexandre de Merode, Vice President of the IOC and Chairman of the IOC Medical Commission, announced in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico: The Medical Commission recently used more advanced drug testing methods to reexamine the urine samples of 1,100 male athletes collected during the Seoul Olympics. The results showed that approximately 5% of these athletes had used anabolic steroids within six months prior to the opening of the Seoul Olympics.

The Belgian prince is currently in San Juan attending the one-week 95th IOC General Assembly. He told the media that at the time of the drug tests in Seoul, these urine samples all tested negative. Although more advanced testing methods have now identified over 50 athletes who used anabolic steroids, it has been a considerable amount of time, so their Olympic results remain valid. He did not disclose the names of these athletes who had violated the rules. Ben Johnson and the nine other athletes were found to have used banned substances at the time, and their results were declared invalid by the IOC. Johnson was also stripped of his 100-meter sprint gold medal.

Although these over 50 athletes narrowly escaped punishment, this scandal clearly tells us that there are still many world-class athletes who dare to use banned substances such as anabolic steroids, and they have sophisticated methods to help them evade the eyes of drug testers.

The reexamination was led by Dr. Manfred Donike of the University of Cologne in the Federal Republic of Germany. He used the principle that certain hormones in the male body change under the influence of anabolic steroids to test whether athletes had used banned substances.

    国际奥委会复查奥运会尿样有惊人发现
    去年奥运会又有50多名运动员服违禁药物
    新华社华盛顿8月27日电  （记者陆文岳）加拿大短跑名将本·约翰逊等10名运动员在汉城奥运会上被查实服用禁药的丑闻余波尚未宁息，国际奥委会近日又披露了一桩更大的丑闻——经复查，又有50多名参加去年夏季奥运会的运动员服用过违禁药物类固醇。
    国际奥委会副主席兼奥委会医学委员会主席亚历山大·德梅罗德亲王8月25日在波多黎各首府圣胡安宣布：该医学委员会不久前运用更先进的药物检测方法对汉城奥运会期间采集到的1100名男运动员的尿样进行了复查，结果发现其中有约5％的运动员在汉城奥运会开幕前的6个月内使用过类固醇。
    这位比利时亲王目前正在圣胡安出席为期一周的第九十五届国际奥委会全体会议。他告诉新闻界，当时在汉城执行药检时，这些尿样都呈阴性。现在虽然使用更先进的检测办法查出其中50多名运动员服用过类固醇，但毕竟隔了较长时间，因此这些运动员的奥运会成绩仍然有效。他没有透露这些事实上犯禁的运动员姓名。本·约翰逊等10名运动员当时就被查出服用违禁药物，其成绩均被国际奥委会宣布作废，约翰逊还被剥夺了一枚百米短跑金牌。
    尽管那50多名运动员侥幸躲过了惩罚，但这桩丑闻却明白无误地告诉人们：斗胆使用类固醇等禁药的世界级运动员仍大有人在，而且他们使用违禁药物的高明手段是可能帮助他们逃过药检官的眼睛的。
    主持此次复查的是联邦德国科隆大学的曼弗雷德·多尼克博士。他是根据男子体内的某些激素在类固醇作用下发生变化的原理来检测运动员是否服用过禁药。
