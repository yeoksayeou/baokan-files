The 13th tropical storm, which moved into Jiangsu's airspace at 6 AM yesterday, entered Anhui province at around 2 AM today. Over the 20 hours the storm passed through, more than 200,000 cadres and masses in relevant regions of Jiangsu province were engaged in flood control, ensuring the safety of river, sea, and lake dikes.

According to the provincial flood control department, when the storm hit, Jiangsu's coastal and riverine areas experienced 8-10 level strong winds and 11 level gusts, accompanied by heavy rain and torrential downpours. At the same time, the ocean experienced high tides, causing the water level in the Yangtze River below Nanjing and Lake Taihu to exceed the warning line again. A total of 27 sections of river and sea dikes in the province were severely eroded, and many sections of the Lake Taihu dike were washed away by the tide. The storm also caused extensive crop lodging and house collapses.

The 13th strong tropical storm, after striking Nanjing and Liyang in Jiangsu, entered Anhui province at around 10 PM on the 4th, bringing heavy rain to the eastern part of the Jianghuai region. According to statistics, the daily rainfall in counties and cities such as He County, Ma'anshan, Hanshan, and Dongtu exceeded 100 millimeters. The flooded farmland in Ma'anshan and Chaohu alone reached 141,000 mu in just one day.
