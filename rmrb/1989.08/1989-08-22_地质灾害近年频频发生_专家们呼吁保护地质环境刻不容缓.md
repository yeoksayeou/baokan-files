    Severe geological disasters are threatening national property and the safety of people's lives. Just this year during the flood season, more than 100,000 landslides, collapses, and mudslides occurred in over 50 counties in Sichuan Province due to heavy rains, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people. In Jilin Province, continuous heavy rains caused multiple landslides, partially disrupting railway transportation and resulting in many deaths and injuries. In Gansu Province's Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, heavy rains and some cracks in the mountains destroyed many roads and bridges, killing 8 people. In Beijing's Miyun County, two townships experienced mudslides, causing houses to collapse and resulting in more than 20 deaths and missing persons...

    The frequency and severity of geological disasters this year have been higher than in previous years, causing more casualties than those directly caused by floods.

    There are many types of geological disasters, including earthquakes, collapses, landslides, mudslides, ground subsidence, ground fissures, soil erosion, desertification, and soil salinization. The causes of these disasters are both natural geological actions and human economic activities. China is a region prone to geological disasters. According to preliminary statistics, over the past century, more than 600 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above have occurred nationwide, with 10% of them being magnitude 7 or above, accounting for 32.5% of the areas and 45% of large and medium-sized cities in high-intensity earthquake zones. At least 70 counties are threatened by mudslides, and there are more than 1,300 mudslide gullies along 30,000 kilometers of mountain railways nationwide. There are more than 1,000 ground fissures distributed in 200 counties and cities, with more than 50 discovered in places like Datong in Shanxi Province and Xi'an in Shaanxi Province, covering an area of 150 square kilometers. Ground subsidence in some coastal cities has become an obstacle to urban development, with Shanghai experiencing a cumulative subsidence of 2.63 meters over nearly 70 years and Tianjin covering a subsidence area of 73,000 square kilometers. The area affected by soil erosion nationwide has reached 1.5 million square kilometers, with 158,000 square kilometers of land facing desertification...

    China has always attached importance to the investigation, monitoring, and prevention of geological disasters. Over the past 40 years, relevant departments have included geological disasters as a key component in their hydrological, geological, engineering geological, and environmental geological surveys and research, achieving significant results. This year, the State Science and Technology Commission and the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, along with other relevant departments, established a research association to systematically study geological disasters and propose comprehensive treatment strategies. Due to long-term insufficient promotion and popularization of relevant professional knowledge, the severity and hazards of geological disasters have not been fully recognized by all sectors of society. China's investigation, monitoring, and prevention of geological disasters are still in the initial stages in many aspects, and many man-made factors leading to geological disasters and hidden dangers have not been eliminated. Recently, when geological experts were drafting the "Outline of the National Geological Disaster Prevention and Control Work Plan," they issued an appeal regarding the increasingly frequent and severe geological disasters:

    The entire society should pay attention to the prevention and control of geological disasters. This type of disaster affects all aspects of society, and its prevention and control cannot rely solely on the work of a few departments. It requires the joint efforts of the country, local governments, and various departments, as well as the mobilization and reliance on the broad masses of the people to achieve results.

    Nationwide, especially in key areas of geological disasters, efforts should be made to popularize scientific knowledge about the geological environment and geological disasters. The role of news media should be fully utilized to let more people understand geological disasters and learn how to identify the precursors of geological disasters and the principles and methods of avoidance, thereby enhancing the nation's awareness of protecting the geological environment.

    The principle of "prevention first, comprehensive treatment" should be implemented to fundamentally change the approach of "treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts," which only addresses symptoms but not the root causes. Decisions should be made to conduct geological disaster prevention and control planning in some key areas, following the principle of "who benefits, who pays; who destroys, who treats," concentrating limited funds to carry out effective comprehensive prevention and control.

    The quality of the geological environment should be considered as one of the prerequisites for economic construction and social development plans, and the geological environment should be effectively protected in various economic activities.

    The prevention and control of geological disasters should be brought under legal regulation, and relevant regulations on "protecting the geological environment and preventing geological disasters" should be drafted as soon as possible to legally stop economic activities that harm the geological environment.

    A national government system for supervising and managing geological environments and geological disasters should be implemented, gradually establishing a unified management system for geological environments and a combination of graded and departmental management. A national geological environment monitoring network, information system, and government geological disaster announcement system should be established.

    地质灾害近年频频发生
    ——专家们呼吁保护地质环境刻不容缓
    本报记者　谢联辉
    严重的地质灾害正在威胁国家财产和人民生命安全。仅今年汛期以来，四川省50多个县因暴雨诱发大小滑坡、崩塌、泥石流就达10万余处，有500多人在地质灾害中丧生；吉林省因连降暴雨，发生多起山体滑坡，致使铁路交通部分中断，死伤多人；甘肃省临夏回族自治州因暴雨和部分山体裂缝，公路、桥梁多处被毁，8人死亡；北京密云县两个乡分别发生泥石流，房倒屋塌，20多人死亡和失踪……比历年频率高、灾情大的地质灾害，造成的人员伤亡远大于洪水直接造成的人员伤亡。
    地质灾害种类很多，有地震、崩塌、滑坡、泥石流、地面沉降、地裂缝、水土流失、土地沙漠化、土壤盐碱化等。产生的原因，一是自然地质作用所致，一是人类经济活动所诱发。我国是地质灾害多发地区，据初步统计，近百年来全国发生6级以上地震600多次，其中7级以上的地震占全球的10％，有32.5％的地区和45％的大中城市处在烈度为7度以上的高地震烈度区；至少有70个县城面临泥石流的威胁，全国3万多公里山区铁路沿线有1300多条泥石流沟；有200个县市共分布有地裂缝1000余条，其中山西省大同市等地发现50多处，陕西省西安市展布范围达150平方公里；沿海部分城市出现的地面沉降已成为城市发展障碍，上海市近70年累计沉降量达2.63米，天津市沉降面积达7300平方公里；全国水土流失面积已达150万平方公里，有15.8万平方公里的土地存在沙漠化危险……
    我国一直重视地质灾害的勘察、监测、防治工作。近40年来各有关部门在开展水文、地质、工程地质和环境地质勘察研究中，都注意把地质灾害列为重要内容，并取得可喜成绩。今年，国家科委、地质矿产部同有关部门一起又成立研究会，开始对地质灾害进行系统研究，以提出综合整治对策。由于长期对有关专业知识宣传、普及不够，地质灾害的严重性和危害性还未被社会各阶层认识，我国地质灾害的勘察、监测、防治工作在许多方面还处于起步阶段，一些本来可以避免的人为因素导致的地质灾害和隐患远未杜绝。日前，地质专家在拟定“全国地质灾害防治工作规划纲要”时，就明显增多、日趋严重的地质灾害发出呼吁：
    全社会应该重视防治地质灾害。这种灾害影响着社会各个方面，对它的防治不可能只依靠几个部门的工作，必须由国家、地方和各部门的共同努力，动员和依靠广大人民群众才能收到成效。
    要在全国特别是地质灾害重点地区，开展地质环境和地质灾害的科学知识普及，充分发挥新闻媒介的作用，让更多的人了解地质灾害和懂得如何发现地质灾害的预兆及防避的原则和方法，增强全民族保护地质环境意识。
    贯彻“以防为主，综合整治”的方针，彻底改变“头痛治头，脚痛治脚”，治标不治本的方法，要下决心对一些重点地区进行地质灾害防治规划，按照“谁得益，谁出钱；谁破坏，谁治理”的原则，集中有限资金，开展有效的综合防治。
    把地质环境质量作为经济建设和社会发展规划的前提条件之一，在各种经济活动中，切实保护好地质环境。
    把地质灾害的防治工作纳入法治轨道，尽快拟订有关“保护地质环境，防治地质灾害”的法规，以法制止危害地质环境的经济活动。
    实行全国地质环境、地质灾害的政府系统的监督管理，逐步建立对地质环境的统一管理和分级、分部门管理相结合的制度，建立全国地质环境监测站网、信息系统和政府发布地质灾害制度。
