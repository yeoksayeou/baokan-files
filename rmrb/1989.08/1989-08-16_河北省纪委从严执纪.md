Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission Strictly Enforces Discipline

The Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has implemented a system where leading cadres take responsibility for specific cases, strictly enforcing discipline to ensure the smooth progress of anti-corruption and clean governance efforts. Currently, the Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection System has investigated and prosecuted 3,837 cases of Party members violating discipline, including 142 cases involving county-level and above leaders.

Through investigations and analysis of typical cases, the Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission found that some cases, especially those involving leading cadres, were difficult to investigate due to three main fears among some leading cadres of the Discipline Inspection Commission: fear that enforcing discipline would hinder reform and opening up; fear of "airing dirty laundry," which would affect their reputation; and fear of their own involvement, leading to the saying, "Pulling out the radish brings out the mud." To remove obstacles in case investigations, the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has strictly implemented a responsibility system where leading cadres are assigned specific cases to investigate and resolve within a set timeframe. By setting examples, they have driven the investigation of other cases. The Jingzhao Company in Tangshan used various illegal means to amass over 2 million yuan in illicit profits, bribing over 100 Party and government officials and social figures, including three county-level leaders. The case was complex and faced significant resistance. A vice secretary and a standing committee member from the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission went to Tangshan multiple times to work with the municipal Party committee, municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, and relevant departments to develop plans and solve problems, quickly uncovering this major case. Another vice secretary and a standing committee member from the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission investigated the case of Wang Shiping, the deputy mayor of Xingtai, who accepted bribes. Wang fabricated false receipts and formed an alliance to resist the investigation, making the case difficult to solve. The two leading cadres worked day and night with the investigators for five or six days, finally getting Wang to confess and promptly transferring the case to the judicial authorities. In the past half year, the 18 major cases assigned to leading cadres of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission have all been basically resolved. Following the lead of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, leading cadres of discipline inspection departments in various cities and provincial-level departments have also taken responsibility for and investigated a batch of cases.

In strictly enforcing discipline, the Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has focused on uncovering corruption and bribery issues involving Party and government leaders from criminal activities such as speculation and fraud exposed in society, as well as economic cases in enterprises. At the same time, it has seriously addressed "hot" issues strongly reflected by the masses about leaders, eliminating corrupt practices and unhealthy trends.

    河北省纪委从严执纪
    本报石家庄电　河北省纪委领导干部分工包案，从严执纪，促使反腐倡廉顺利进行。目前，河北省纪检系统立案查处党员违纪案件3837件，其中涉及处级以上领导干部142人。
    河北省纪委通过调查研究和分析典型案例发现，有些案件特别是涉及领导干部的案件查不下去，原因是有些纪委领导干部心存三怕：怕执行纪律冲淡改革开放；怕“家丑外扬”，影响自己的名声；怕自身不干净，“拔出萝卜带出泥”。为扫除查案障碍，省纪委严格实行了领导干部层层包案责任制，要求分工包查的案件限期查结，用典型开路，带动其它案件的查处。唐山市京兆公司采用各种非法手段牟取暴利200多万元，并通过资助、送礼、提成、行贿，拉拢腐蚀100多名党政干部和社会知名人士，其中有3名地市级领导干部，案情复杂，阻力很大。省纪委分包此案的一位副书记和一名常委多次到唐山，同市委、市纪委及有关部门一起研究方案，解决遇到的问题，很快查清了这一大案。省纪委另一位副书记和一位常委分包查处邢台市副市长王世平收受贿赂案。王编造假收据，订立攻守同盟，使查案工作遇到困难。纪委两位领导同志夜以继日地同办案同志工作了五六天，终于使王交代了问题，及时将此案移交司法机关。半年多来，省纪委领导同志分工包查的18起重大案件，都已基本查清。在省纪委带动下，各地市及省直纪检部门领导也分包并查处了一批案件。
    河北省纪委在从严执纪中，一方面注意从社会上揭露出来的倒买倒卖、投机诈骗等犯罪活动及企业经济案件中，深挖与之有牵连的党政领导干部贪污受贿问题；一方面认真解决群众对领导反映强烈的“热点”问题，消除不廉洁现象和不正之风。（陈国琦　纪言）
