"Shenma" Starts to Run to the World

The Jingwei Textile Factory in Pingdingshan has become one of the world's top three manufacturers of tire cord fabric, with its products in high demand on the international market.

By the end of July this year, the Pingdingshan Nylon Tire Cord Fabric Factory, one of the world's top three manufacturers, had exported 1,800 tons of "Shenma" brand nylon 66 tire cord fabric. This marks the end of the era when China completely relied on imports for nylon tire cord fabric and the beginning of a new era when China has the capability to export such products.

As "Shenma" broke into the international market, it immediately attracted attention and gained trust. The British Dunlop Tire Company decided to use "Shenma" tire cord fabric to produce "Dunlop" brand tires. A company in Thailand registered "Shenma" as a duty-free product and requested purchases. Even some companies in developed countries that produce tire cord fabric are competing to sign contracts with China, expressing their willingness to buy as much as possible.

The factory's complete set of equipment was imported from Japan. The first phase of the project was completed and put into production in 1981. A Japanese expert had previously asserted that China could not manage this factory well. However, after visiting the factory a year later, the expert was deeply impressed and mentioned three "unexpected" observations: he did not expect the Chinese side to manage the factory so well, did not expect the workers to master the technology so quickly, and did not expect the product quality to be so high. Subsequently, the two sides cooperated to complete the second phase of the project in 1987.

Nylon 66 tire cord fabric is the best material for the carcass of rubber tires. Over the past eight years, the factory has produced 120,000 tons of tire cord fabric, saving over $500 million in foreign exchange and generating over 600 million yuan in taxes (an average of 190,000 yuan per person). Due to the high strength, light weight, corrosion resistance, and impact resistance of nylon 66 tire cord fabric, producing one tire with it saves 80 yuan compared to using cotton tire cord fabric. This alone results in a social benefit of over 700 million yuan per year.

    “神马”开始奔向世界
    平顶山锦纶帘子布厂成为世界三大帘子布厂之一，产品在国际市场抢手
    本报讯　至今年7月底，世界三大帘子布厂之一的平顶山锦纶帘子布厂，已出口“神马”牌锦纶66帘子布1800吨。这标志着我国锦纶帘子布完全依赖进口的时代已经结束，有能力出口的新时代正在开始。
    “神马”冲出国门，立即受到国际市场的关注和信赖。英国登录普轮胎公司，决定今后使用“神马”帘子布生产“登录普”牌轮胎；泰国一家公司将“神马”作为免验产品，要求购买；甚至连帘子布发达国家的一些公司也争着与我国签订合同，表示“给多少要多少”。
    该厂的全套设备是从日本引进的。第一期工程于1981年建成投产。日本专家曾断言中国管不好这个工厂。一年后这位专家回访时，却不胜感慨地讲了三个“想不到”：想不到中方把工厂管理得这么好，想不到工人对技术掌握得这么快，想不到产品质量这么高。于是双方合作，于1987年建成了第二期工程。
    锦纶66帘子布是制造橡胶轮胎的最佳骨架材料。该厂投产8年来，已生产帘子布12万吨，节约外汇5亿多美元，创税利6亿多元（人均19万多元）。由于锦纶66帘子布强力高，比重小，耐腐蚀，耐冲击，制作一个轮胎比用棉帘子布节省80多元，仅此一项，一年社会效益达7亿多元。
