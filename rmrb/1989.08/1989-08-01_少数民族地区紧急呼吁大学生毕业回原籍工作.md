In March of this year, during the People's Congress and Political Consultative Conference of our Chengbu Miao Autonomous County in Hunan Province, representatives and committee members unanimously raised the issue of a severe shortage of talents in minority regions. The main reason for this is that in recent years, over 150 students have been sent to universities each year, but fewer than 10% of the graduates return. Even the much-needed professional talents for the Miao region avoid coming back due to the harsh natural conditions and poor living standards. They find ways to avoid returning to their hometowns, leading to an increasing shortage of talents. As economic construction advances, the demand for talents in minority regions continues to grow, exacerbating the talent shortage.

Minority regions, due to historical and natural reasons, are already lagging behind in culture, education, and science. If this situation persists, when will the backward conditions be improved? Therefore, the people of minority regions urgently appeal: university graduates should return to their hometowns to build their home regions and not forget the land where they grew up. At the same time, we hope that the units allocating university graduates will also consider the construction and development of our minority regions!

    少数民族地区紧急呼吁大学生毕业回原籍工作
    今年3月，我们湖南省城步苗族自治县召开人大、政协全会时，代表、委员不约而同地提出一个民族地区人才奇缺的问题。产生的原因主要是，近几年来，每年输送入大学的学生在150人以上，可每年回来的大学毕业生不到10％。就是苗乡急需的专业对口人才，由于大学生本人及其父母嫌民族地区自然条件、生活条件差，找熟人、拉关系，千方百计避免回原籍工作。回原籍的大学毕业生越来越少，而随着经济建设的向前发展，少数民族地区需要的人越来越多，致使人才奇缺。
    民族地区由于历史、自然等种种原因，文化、教育、科学等本来就比较落后，长此以往，落后面貌何时才能解决呢？所以民族地区人民紧急呼吁：大学毕业生要回原籍建设家乡，千万不要忘记生长于兹的故土，同时，希望分配大学毕业生的单位也要考虑我们民族地区的建设和发展！
