    Farmer Strikes Down Helicopter with Rock
    2 Injured, 1 Escapes

    Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, August 10 — Spanish police today arrested a man suspected of striking down a military helicopter with a rock.

    According to reports, on the 10th, a helicopter belonging to the Spanish Army crashed after being struck by a rock while flying at low altitude over the Mataelpino mountain area, about 50 kilometers from Madrid. Of the three soldiers on board, two were seriously injured, and one escaped.

    At present, the police have not disclosed the identity of the suspect, so it is still unknown whether the helicopter was struck down by a nearby farmer or a passerby. However, there is information that a farmer in the area had previously expressed dissatisfaction with military aircraft training flights over his farm, stating that the noise from the aircraft had frightened his cattle.

    农场主飞石击落直升机
    2人重伤　1人脱险
    新华社马德里8月10日电　西班牙警方今天逮捕了一名涉嫌用石块击落军用直升机的男子。
    据此间报道，10日，一架属于西班牙陆军的直升机，在距马德里约50公里处的马塔埃尔皮诺山区低空盘旋时，被人用石块击中螺旋桨后坠毁。在机上的3名军人中，2人受重伤，一人脱险。
    目前，警方尚未透露被捕者的身份，因此人们还无法了解是附近一农场主或是一过路人击落了直升机。不过，有消息说，附近一家农场主曾多次对军用飞机到农场上空进行训练飞行表示不满，理由是飞机轰鸣声惊吓了他的牛群。
