The name of the director of the Hubei Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, Yu Xiaoyu, is truly unique: it is humorous yet reveals an extraordinary level of awareness and is full of a spirit of enterprise.

And it is well-deserved. He is not only skilled at directing comedies, but when others were still engrossed in the frenzy of opening traditional operas, he had already begun creating "contemporary opera." Since 1978, he has directed and produced Peking Opera productions such as "A Packet of Honey," "Xu Jiujing's Promotion," "The Legend of the Medicine King Temple," and "Ointment Zhang," as well as Hubei Flower Drum Opera "Family Case," "Water Town Sentiments," Han Opera and Shanghai Opera "The Girl Who Plays the Guitar," Chu Opera "Liu Chongjing Beats His Wife," Cantonese Opera "Yin and Yang Grievances," and Qu Opera "The Young Emperor." He produces one play per year, with ten plays performed in Beijing, and has won national awards four times. He himself has also been awarded the "May Day Labor Medal."

In recent years, Yu Xiaoyu has reflected on the lessons of the past century, where Peking Opera, Han Opera, and Chu Opera have become detached from the emotions and pains of the people, moving from the folk to the "temple" of form and technique, leading to their decline. He has also considered the issues of some modern plays and new historical dramas that have been adapted from Western opera and drama, forcing them into a mold, dividing scenes and settings, fixing time and space, and abandoning the Chinese opera's aesthetic of suggestion, resulting in "drama with singing," which is bland and insipid. He is determined to inherit the essence of Chinese opera aesthetics and create a form of "contemporary opera" that is relatively independent of traditional opera and resonates with the aesthetic pursuits of contemporary audiences.

His "contemporary opera" has several distinct characteristics. Firstly, unlike some experimental dramas that "dilute" society and life, his works have a strong sense of the times, a rich atmosphere of life, and express the voices of the masses. They resonate with the emotions of the broad audience and are filled with a sense of righteousness. Last year, when directing "The Young Emperor" in Beijing, some suggested removing the reform content from the play and turning it into a pure romance. He insisted, "Reform should not be removed; it should be strengthened. Without the consensus on reform, emotions have nothing to rely on." The result was a success.

Secondly, in terms of stage expression, he does not use traditional opera's "old bottle with new wine," nor does he, like some modern plays, "change the soul" and regress to the realism of opera and drama. Instead, he "changes the soul," taking the abstract and multi-meaningful "one table and two chairs" stage language of traditional opera as the "root," absorbing various modern artistic elements, and creating an abstract and multi-meaningful "series platform." This gives it the "geometric beauty" of contemporary technology while returning and promoting the unique time and space virtuality of Chinese opera's "no scene" narrative method, laying the foundation for the creation of a modernized "contemporary opera" system with national characteristics.

Thirdly, in terms of stage language, he does not, like some modern plays, use "drama with singing" or Western opera-style dance as decoration and interlude. Instead, he creates contemporary danceable life, especially using the Chinese opera aesthetic thinking of "exaggeration, deformation, suggestion, and spirit," creating dances such as "tennis dance," "wheelchair waltz," "group dance of phone calls," "self," "id," "superego" of "Xu Jiujing's Three-Person Dance," and "soul manifestation" of "Yin and Yang Male-Female Duet," which have contemporary brightness. He breaks the ice of "industrial era complex mental labor space that cannot dance" and has a harmonious internal tension; for the contemporary opera vocabulary system, he creates a series of examples.

His directed "contemporary opera" has the flavor, atmosphere, and charm of traditional opera, as well as the interest, brightness, and quality of contemporary industrial civilization, making people feel "both familiar and fresh." Therefore, it has won the approval of the older audience and the admiration of the younger intellectual audience who are tired of watching opera. His directed plays such as "Home," "Sea," "Play," "Water," and "Xu" have been performed continuously for 100 to 500 times. Japanese theater people who came to China for a tour were "amazed" after watching the play "Play" and published articles and letters in Japan saying: It has "broad implications for the reform of the 'Kabuki crisis' in Japan."

Yu Xiaoyu was born in 1935 in Wuhan into a family of performers. From a young age, he learned the various roles of sheng, dan, jing, mo, and chou. In 1956, he studied directing. In 1957, he directed the modern Chu Opera "Liu Jiemei," which was made into a film. Since then, he has directed about 60 operas. The China Academy of Arts and other units plan to hold the "Hubei Provincial Peking Opera Troupe Ten-Year Anniversary and Yu Xiaoyu Directing Art Symposium" this year to further summarize his directing achievements.

    他倾心于戏曲现代化
    ——记湖北省京剧团导演余笑予
    陈斌善
    自己嘲笑自己？！湖北省京剧团编导余笑予这个名字真“绝”：幽默中流露着非凡的清醒，充满着进取精神。
    也名副其实。他不仅是个编导喜剧的能手，当人们还沉湎在传统戏开放的狂热中时，他便开始了
  “当代戏曲”创作。1978年来，他先后编导了京剧《一包蜜》、《徐九经升官记》、《药王庙传奇》、《膏药章》，荆州花鼓戏《家庭公案》、《水乡情》，汉剧和沪剧《弹吉它的姑娘》，楚剧《刘崇景打妻》，粤剧《阴阳怨》，曲剧《少年天子》等，一年一出戏，10台戏进京，四次获全国大奖。他本人还荣获了“五一劳动奖章”。
    这些年来，余笑予反思着近百年来京剧、汉剧、楚剧脱离人民群众的情感和痛痒、由民间走上唯形式技巧的“庙堂”而衰微的教训和某些现代戏、新编历史剧横移西洋歌剧、话剧体制，削足适履，分场置景，时空固定，抛弃中国戏曲写意美学，“话剧加唱”，清汤白水，淡乎寡味的症结，决心继承中国戏曲美学的精髓，创建一种相对独立于传统戏、与当代观众的审美追求沟通契合的“当代戏曲”。
    他的“当代戏曲”有几个显著的特征。首先是不像有些探索戏剧那样“淡化”社会和人生，而是具有强烈的时代感，浓郁的生活气息，倾吐人民大众的心声，引爆广大普通观众共振的情愫，洋溢着一股浩然之气。去年在北京导演《少年天子》，有的同志提出剔除剧中的改革内容，搞成纯言情剧。他坚持认为：“改革不应剔除，还应加强。没有改革的共识，情感就无所依附。”结果取得了成功。
    其次，在舞台表达方式上，他不是用传统戏“旧瓶装新酒”，也不是像某些现代戏那样“脱胎换骨”，向写实的歌剧、话剧退化，而是“夺胎换骨”，攫取传统戏中抽象多义的“一桌二椅”的舞台表述语汇为“语根”，吸收各种现代艺术语素，创造了抽象多义的“系列平台”，使之具有当代科技的“几何美”，又使中国戏曲最独特的时空虚拟的“无场次”叙述方式得以回归和弘扬，为创建具有民族气派的现代化的“当代戏曲”体制奠定了基础。
    第三，在舞台表述语言上，他不是像某些现代戏那样“话剧加唱”，或西洋歌剧式的将舞蹈作为点缀和穿插，而是通过“选择当代可舞性生活”，特别是运用“夸张、变形、写意、传神”的中国戏曲美学思维，创造诸如“打网球舞”、“轮椅圆舞曲”、“打电话群舞曲”、“自我”“本我”、“超我”的“徐九经三人舞”、灵魂现形的“阴阳男女双人舞”等具有当代亮色的戏曲舞蹈，打破了“工业时代复杂的脑力劳动空间舞不起来”的坚冰，又有谐和内控的张力；为当代戏曲的语汇系统创造了一系列范例。
    他导演的“当代戏曲”由于具有传统戏曲的滋味、意境和神韵，又具有当代工业文明的情趣、亮色和质素，使人们“既熟悉又新鲜”，因而使广大老观众折服首肯，也使厌看戏曲的青年知识观众群垂青惊顾。他导演的《家》、《海》、《弹》、《水》、《徐》等剧，连续演出达一百至五百场以上。日本戏剧界人士来中国巡回考察，看了《弹》剧，大为“惊讶”，在东瀛发表文章和来信说：对日本改革“歌舞伎危机”，具有“广泛的认识意义”。
    余笑予1935年在武汉出生于梨园之家，自幼学习了生、旦、净、末、丑等各个行当。1956年学导演。1957年执导的楚剧现代戏《刘介梅》被拍成电影以来，共导演了60来部戏曲。中国艺术研究院戏曲研究所等单位拟于今年召开“湖北省京剧团十年暨余笑予导演艺术研讨会”，进一步总结他导演的艺术成就。
