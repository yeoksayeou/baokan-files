The systematic publication of Tibetan Han text ancient books in China has achieved new successes. Over 40 kinds and more than 200 volumes of precious classics, rare books, secret manuscripts, and handwritten documents from the Sui and Tang dynasties to the Republic of China have recently begun to be published and distributed, with a total print run of over 300,000 copies.

Historically, the Tibetan people have had close interactions with the Han people and other ethnic groups, leaving behind many precious cultural relics and historical materials. In the past, these have not been systematically compiled and published. This is the first time since the founding of the People's Republic of China that such a large number of ancient books, documents, and secret manuscripts have been systematically published.

According to experts, these publications have extremely high research and historical value. They are of great significance in strengthening national unity, promoting cultural exchanges at home and abroad, and enriching the cultural treasures of the motherland.

    藏学汉文古籍研究有成就  一大批孤本秘籍发行面世
    据新华社北京8月22日电　（记者格来）我国藏学汉文古籍整理系统出版工作获得新成就。隋唐至民国历代40多种、200余本珍贵典籍、孤本、秘籍和手稿文献、丛书等最近开始出版发行，总印数达30多万册。
    历史上藏族同汉族和其他民族交往很密，留下了许多珍贵的文物和史料，过去未曾专门系统整理出版。这次系统出版这样多的古籍、文献、秘籍等，是建国以来的第一次。
    据专家介绍，这些出版物具有极高的研究和史料价值，对加强民族团结，增进国内外文化交流，丰富祖国的文化宝库，有着重要意义。
