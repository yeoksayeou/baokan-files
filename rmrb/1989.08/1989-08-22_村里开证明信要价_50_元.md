On the morning of July 10, an elderly man using two crutches came to the county civil affairs bureau to obtain an official letter. When the bureau staff handed the stamped letter to the old man, he asked how much it would cost. The staff were puzzled. The old man was overjoyed to learn that obtaining an official letter did not require any payment. He remarked, "The county does not charge for official letters, but the village charges 50 yuan. This is not reasonable!"

The old man is named Zhao Fuyin, a second-class disabled veteran from Qianyan Village, Guanfang Township. He told us that in his village, the charges for official letters with the village seal are as follows: 10 yuan for general proofs, 30 yuan for employment proofs, and 50 yuan for marriage proofs. Several people who came from the township to handle business mentioned that their areas have similar situations, and the public has strong objections to this practice.

    村里开证明信要价50元
    7月10日上午，一位拄着双拐的老人来到县民政局开证明信，当民政局的同志把盖好公章的证明信交给老人时，老人问要多少钱，民政局的同志迷惑不解。老人得知开证明信不用出钱时，感慨地说：“县里开证明信一分钱不要，村里却要50元，这是哪家的理？”
    这位老人叫赵甫进，二等残废军人，是关防乡前岩村人，他向我们诉说了本村开证明信盖公章的要价：一般证明10元，招工证明30元，结婚证明50元。据在场的几位从乡下来办事的同志说，他们那里也有类似情况，群众对此意见很大。
