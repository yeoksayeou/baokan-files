Shanghai Expands Pension Fund Pooling

	Shanghai has implemented pension fund pooling for 13,000 enterprises, 3.5 million employees, and 1.26 million retired workers. These figures represent 81% and 85% of the total number of employees in state-owned and collective enterprises in the city, respectively. Shanghai has thus become one of the cities with the widest coverage of pension fund pooling in the country.

	Shanghai began implementing pension fund pooling in 1986. The pooled funds are based on the principle of "collection based on expenditure, with a slight surplus," and are adjusted according to the actual situation of each enterprise. This year, the pooling rate for state-owned enterprises has reached 25.5% of the total wage bill, while collective enterprises have also increased their contributions according to their specific circumstances. The implementation of pension fund pooling in Shanghai has been widely welcomed.

	It is understood that relevant departments in Shanghai are taking measures to develop employee pension insurance towards socialization. When conditions are ripe, they will gradually develop into a pension insurance service industry that provides living services for retired and resigned personnel.

    职工养老保险趋向社会化
    上海推广退休金统筹
    本报上海8月7日电　上海市已有1.3万家企业、350万在职职工、126万离退休职工实行退休费社会统筹。他们分别占全市全民、集体企业职工总数的81％和85％。上海已成为全国退休费社会统筹覆盖面最广的城市之一。
    上海是从1986年开始实施退休费社会统筹的。统筹资金根据“以支定筹，略有结余”的原则，结合企业的实际，采取分年过渡办法，按一定比例递增。今年，全民企业退休费统筹已达工资总额的25.5％，集体企业根据各自不同的情况，也按一定比例提取。上海实行退休费社会统筹，受到普遍欢迎。
    据了解，上海市有关部门正在采取措施，使职工养老保险向社会化方向发展，在条件成熟时，逐步发展为离退休人员生活服务的养老保险服务事业。　（戴律国　萧关根）
