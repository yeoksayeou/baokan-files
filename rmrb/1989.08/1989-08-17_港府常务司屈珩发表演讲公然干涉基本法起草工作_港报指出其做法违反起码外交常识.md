Hong Kong's Chief Secretary, C.H. Fownes-Cove, delivered a speech titled "Sorting Out the Situation" on August 14, openly interfering with the drafting of the Basic Law, drawing strong attention from public opinion in Hong Kong. Some newspapers pointed out that Fownes-Cove's actions "violated basic diplomatic norms."

The draft of the Basic Law was published in Hong Kong on April 28, 1988. That afternoon, the Hong Kong government issued a statement on the publication of the draft of the Basic Law. The spokesman said: "Drafting the Basic Law is the responsibility of the Chinese government."

However, as a high-ranking official of the Hong Kong government, Fownes-Cove today publicly made a nearly comprehensive analysis of the Basic Law. The Hong Kong "Kwong Wah Daily News" reported on the front page with a large headline: "Fownes-Cove Criticizes Five Major Flaws in the Basic Law Without Reservation."

The "Sing Tao Daily" reported that Fownes-Cove, who is in charge of Hong Kong's transitional period affairs, "raised the most pointed questions about the Basic Law from the British side in recent years, sparking a 'diplomatic storm'."

In his speech, Fownes-Cove offered some fundamental views on the Basic Law, mainly: the promulgation of the Basic Law should be postponed, the People's Liberation Army does not need to be stationed in Hong Kong during peacetime, certain provisions of the Basic Law "deviate from the existing system," and do not "adequately reflect the provisions of the Joint Declaration," etc.

An article published today in "Wen Wei Po" stated: "The drafting, consultation, and promulgation of the Basic Law are entirely the responsibility of the Chinese side. As a high-ranking official of the Hong Kong government, Fownes-Cove has no reason to publicly express his opinions. If there is anything to express, it should be done through diplomatic channels. Fownes-Cove's actions are truly 'not playing by the rules,' violating basic diplomatic norms."

The article pointed out: "Drafting the Basic Law is an important task that the Chinese side is undertaking to fulfill the Joint Declaration. From the start of the drafting to now, it has been 4 years, and no high-ranking British government official has criticized the Basic Law's provisions as being inconsistent with the Joint Declaration. The Hong Kong government is a subordinate government of the British government, and its officials have no right to make such criticisms of the Basic Law. The responsibility of the Hong Kong government is to ensure the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong during the transitional period, and the normal development of Sino-British relations is an important condition for the smooth transition of Hong Kong. Stirring up and damaging Sino-British relations is of no benefit to Hong Kong's present and future, which is a matter of common sense."

An article published today in "Ta Kung Pao" stated: "Drafting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is entirely the responsibility of the Chinese government. The Chinese government has done a great deal of work for this. Hong Kong citizens, as well as members of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the Basic Law Consultative Committee, have also done a great deal of work. The drafting of the Basic Law has achieved significant results. This is known to everyone. During the drafting of the Basic Law, the Chinese government has also been willing to listen to beneficial opinions from the British government. Fownes-Cove is fully aware of this."

The article pointed out: "British government officials have previously expressed to Chinese officials that they hope Chinese officials will comment less on Hong Kong's political affairs, as a slight misstep could affect the confidence of Hong Kong people. Then why, when it comes to such important issues, do high-ranking officials of the Hong Kong government act so unconsciously?"

### 港府常务司屈珩发表演讲公然干涉基本法起草工作  港报指出其做法违反起码外交常识

    港府常务司屈珩发表演讲公然干涉基本法起草工作
    港报指出其做法违反起码外交常识
    新华社香港8月16日电　香港政府常务司屈珩14日在一个公开场合发表了一次题为《收拾局面》的演讲，公然干涉基本法的起草工作，引起此间舆论的强烈关注。有的报纸指出，屈珩的做法“违反了起码的外交常识”。
    基本法（草案）征求意见稿于1988年4月28日在香港公布。当天下午，香港政府就基本法（草案）征求意见稿的公布发表声明。发言人说：“起草基本法是中国政府的责任”。
    然而，身为港府高层官员的屈珩今天却公开对基本法做了一次几乎全面的评析。香港《快报》在头版头条位置以大字标题报道说：“基本法五大漏洞屈珩不留情面质疑”。
    《星岛日报》报道说，专负处理香港过渡期事务的屈珩，在日前“提出了英方近年对基本法最尖锐的质疑，惹来了一场‘外交风波’”。
    屈珩在他的演讲中，对基本法提出了一些根本性的看法，主要有：基本法颁布的时间应当押后，解放军在平时没有必要驻港，基本法某些条文“背离了现有制度”，没有“充分反映联合声明有关条文的规定”等。
    《文汇报》今天刊登的一篇署名专论说：“基本法的制定、咨询、颁布完全是中国方面的事情，屈珩作为港府高官，没有理由公开发表意见。如果确有什么要表示的也应透过外交途径。屈珩的做法，真正是‘不按牌理出牌’，违反了起码的外交常识”。
    专论指出：“起草基本法是中方为履行联合声明所做的一项重要工作，从开始起草至今已4年的时间，并没有哪一位英国政府的高级官员指责基本法条文与《联合声明》相违，香港政府是英国政府的一个下属政府，她的官员又有什么资格对基本法做出这样的指责。香港政府的责任是确保香港在过渡期内的繁荣稳定，而中英关系的正常发展是保障香港平稳过渡的重要条件，挑拨、损害中英关系对香港的今日和明天都毫无好处，这是常识范围的问题”。
    《大公报》今天发表的一篇署名文章说：“起草香港特别行政区基本法完全是中国政府的事。中国政府为此做了大量工作。香港市民以及基本法起草委员会委员、基本法咨询委员会也为此做了大量工作。基本法的起草已经取得了很大的成绩。这是大家都知道的。在基本法起草过程中，中国政府也乐于听取英国政府有益的意见。对此屈珩先生也是完全清楚的”。
    文章指出：“英国政府方面人士曾经几次向中方人士提出，希望中方官员少对香港的政治事务发表意见，稍一不慎，会影响港人的信心。那么为什么牵涉到上述这样重要的一些问题，港府高官又那么不自觉呢？”
