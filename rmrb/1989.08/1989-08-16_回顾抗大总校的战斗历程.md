Over 50 years ago, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (抗大), led personally by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, gathered the elite from the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Red Army. Its traditions and styles are forever worthy of our learning. Below, I will recount the glorious course of study, combat, production, and labor of the Anti-Japanese University.

**A Difficult Beginning: The First and Second Periods**

The first period of the Anti-Japanese University (originally named "Red University") began on June 1, 1936, and graduated in December of the same year. To develop the favorable situation of the anti-Japanese national united front after the "December 12 Incident," over 200 revolutionary cadres, armed with military and political theories, took up various combat positions. They played a brilliant role at the critical moment of continuing to strive for domestic peace and organizing the anti-Japanese war.

The second period of the Anti-Japanese University began on January 20, 1937, after the "December 12 Incident," and graduated with the outbreak of the "July 7 Incident" in 1937. At this time, to adapt to the new domestic political situation, the school was officially renamed the "Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University," and its location was moved from Baoyuan to Yan'an. It grew from the first period's 3 teachers and about 300 students to over 1,000 students, becoming a large-scale school. As soon as the cannon fire of the "Lugou Bridge" resistance war sounded, over 1,000 of the most steadfast national revolutionary warriors immediately rushed to the front lines, giving the vicious Japanese aggressors a resounding response.

The basic characteristics of the Anti-Japanese University's first and second periods can be said to be the result of Comrade Mao Zedong's personal careful cultivation and the hard work of the broad teaching and administrative staff and students. It laid a solid foundation for the subsequent revolutionary education cause. Central leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Chen Yun all gave lectures and reports at the school. For example, Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant works "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction" were all personally lectured by Mao Zedong to the students of the first and second periods.

At that time, to overcome the difficulties of textbooks, classrooms, and school buildings, the Anti-Japanese University made arduous efforts. Lacking textbooks, experienced students and teachers discussed and wrote them together; without classrooms, the mountains and courtyards became natural classrooms; students had no chairs, so they piled up broken bricks to make seats; two knees were the only desks for students to take notes during lectures.

The students of the Anti-Japanese University's first and second periods were all heroes who emerged from the long-term cultivation of the Party and the domestic revolutionary wars. They were steadfast, experienced in countless battles, and had rich revolutionary war and practical experience. Many of them had served as regiment commanders, division commanders, army commanders, and even higher positions during the domestic revolutionary war period. For example, Comrades Luo Ronghuan, Luo Rucheng, Zhang Jichun, Su Zhenhua, Hu Yaobang, He Longgong, and Zhang Aiping all studied in the first and second periods of the Anti-Japanese University. Many of them also participated in the school's establishment and leadership for a relatively long period. They were both students and builders of the school.

The main contributions of the Anti-Japanese University's first and second periods were: first, to gather the leading cadres and various levels of cadres from the three front armies and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Red Army, which played a decisive role in summarizing the combat experience of the entire Red Army, integrating the traditions and styles of various front armies, and making them flourish, becoming the excellent traditions and styles of our Party and Army; second, through the second period's education and improvement of several hundred external youth students, not only did they understand the importance of the anti-Japanese national united front politically, but they also learned necessary strategic and tactical knowledge, especially guerrilla tactics and political work knowledge, and received strict training and demands in their thoughts, actions, and living styles, thus creating good experiences for the Party and the school in the work of winning over, educating, and transforming intellectuals; third, the school spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness required by Comrade Mao Zedong achieved good results through the mutual learning and integration of old and new cadres, thus establishing excellent traditions and styles for the subsequent school work.

**Rapid Development: The Third and Fourth Periods**

After the "July 7 Incident," with the outbreak of the anti-Japanese war in North China, the third period of the Anti-Japanese University began in August 1937. After more than eight months of combat study, over 2,000 cadres were sent to the anti-Japanese front lines by April 1938.

The opening ceremony of the fourth period of the Anti-Japanese University was held in Yan'an on April 16, 1938. This was a grand meeting held under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, expressing the determination of the Anti-Japanese University to the people of the entire country to win the anti-war and demonstrating to Japanese imperialism. After a few months of short-term study, over 1,400 students graduated in advance on the "August 1" Army Day and participated in the bloody battle to defend Wuhan.

Due to the increase in students, the Anti-Japanese University had to expand its campuses, reaching as far north as Panlong and Wayaogou, as far south as Luochuan, and as far west as Qingyang in Gansu. This was the school's prosperous period.

At that time, a significant event for the Anti-Japanese University's education was the convening of the first representative conference of the Anti-Japanese University of the Communist Party of China in Yan'an in October 1937, shortly after the third period began. The central task of the conference was to deeply carry out the struggle against the erroneous line of Zhang Guotao, further unite the broad cadres of the three front armies, and pay widespread attention to winning over and educating revolutionary young intellectuals. The conference, through democratic elections, formally established the Party Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China's Anti-Japanese University, strengthening the Party's overall leadership of the school.

The basic characteristics of the Anti-Japanese University's third and fourth periods were to respond to Comrade Mao Zedong's call to "learn skills and go to the front lines" with a combat posture and conduct combat study in a combat environment. At that time, the students were either from all over the country or from the front lines of the Eighth Route Army. They studied intensively while being ready to rush to the front lines at any time. Therefore, some students, shortly after entering the school, were adjusted to the front lines due to the urgent needs of the war. They had no personal hesitation in front of the orders but only bravely moved forward, showing the glorious style of revolutionary warriors.

The harvest of the Anti-Japanese University's third and fourth periods was outstanding: first, the three educational policies formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Anti-Japanese University—"firm and correct political direction, hardworking and thrifty work style, and flexible and mobile strategy and tactics"—became even clearer; second, to adapt to the requirements of the war at that time, military education and strict military life for students were further strengthened. Therefore, starting from the third period, a special military cadre training team was established, laying a solid foundation for strengthening military education in the school; third, to adapt to the development of the school, improve the teaching methods and management methods of the school, starting from the third period, a number of school work cadres and teachers were planned and trained from the students. On the basis of setting up teacher training teams, political work training teams, team leader training teams, and other teams were also established. In addition, there were staff training teams and enemy work training teams, which cultivated many teaching talents for the school's establishment and military training, strengthening the school's leadership; fourth, continuing to carry forward the tradition of hard work and the combat style of unity and tension. For example, at the beginning of the third period, the number of students increased sharply, and the school buildings were insufficient. Relying on the hands of this group of young people, after less than two weeks of labor, more than 170 cave dwellings were dug out, allowing the then more than 2,000 people in the two large teams to immediately have new school buildings.

**Continuous Growth: The Fifth and Sixth Periods**

The students of the fifth period of the Anti-Japanese University came to the school in large numbers before and after the fall of Wuhan in autumn and winter 1938, and the formal opening ceremony was held on January 28, 1939, the anniversary of the anti-war. At that time, the anti-Japanese war had entered a new stage. At the expanded "Sixth Plenum" of the Communist Party of China in autumn and winter 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee pointed out that with the arrival of the new stage of the anti-war, it was especially necessary to emphasize the expansion and development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and the establishment and consolidation of more anti-Japanese base areas. It was also required that the work of cultivating cadres by the Anti-Japanese University should be further combined with the struggle of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army behind enemy lines. Due to this situation of struggle, the broad patriotic youth of the whole country, although facing the double pressure and layer-by-layer blockade and obstruction of the Japanese invaders and anti-communist forces, their hearts were always yearning for Yan'an. They had broken through the obstruction of the Nationalist Party's police and secret agents and the imprisonment of concentration camps and finally rushed into Yan'an. "Anti-Japanese University, the more it resists, the bigger it gets." At its peak, the fifth period of the Anti-Japanese University expanded to eight large teams, with each team having more than a thousand students. In particular, the female students representing the vanguard of new Chinese women also continued to grow, and a separate "Eighth Large Team of the Anti-Japanese University" was established, attracting the attention of people at home and abroad.

To accomplish the new tasks, the fifth period of the Anti-Japanese University took several important measures: (1) To deeply convey the resolutions of the "Sixth Plenum," the Political Department of the School Party Committee dispatched responsible comrades to various large teams to convey and explain, regarding it as the most vivid Marxist-Leninist education and the school's ideological preparation for executing new tasks. (2) To form the first and second branch schools and dispatch them to North China behind enemy lines as two vanguard teams for developing anti-war education behind enemy lines. This was an innovation in the history of the anti-war. The purpose was to combine the school's theoretical study with actual combat. (3) A comprehensive review of school work—this was a comprehensive summary of the school's work in nearly three years since its establishment. From January 15, 1939, to March 15, it lasted for two months. The scope of the review covered the school's educational work, political work, and all aspects of administrative management, supply, hygiene, and other work, thus improving the school cadres' understanding and ability of the school's overall work, reviewing shortcomings, and promoting achievements, and determining the clear direction for improving future work. (4) To break the enemy's economic blockade on the border area, in response to Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee's call to launch a large-scale production movement, the entire school's teachers and students were mobilized to actively participate in land reclamation, sowing, fertilizing, weeding, and other activities. They decided to open up and cultivate 20,000 mu of land and produce 3,300 dan of grain to contribute to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. (5) To insist on the anti-war behind enemy lines in North China, a large number of cadres in the army were cultivated. The Central Committee decided that the Anti-Japanese University would immediately go deep into the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region to insist on anti-war education. By the end of 1939, all the students of the fifth period graduated and were assigned to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

The Anti-Japanese University stayed in Jin-Cha-Ji for more than four months and, in February 1940, according to the original plan, crossed the blockade line of the Zhengtai Railway and moved to the Taihang Mountains in the Jin-Cha-Ji-Yu Border Region. At that time, the first branch school had moved from Tainan to Shandong, and after merging with the remaining large team of the first branch school and preparing, the opening ceremony of the sixth period was held in Panlong Town, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, on April 15, 1940. Comrade Peng Dehuai gave a speech at the meeting, pointing out: "The Central Committee requires the Anti-Japanese University to play a backbone role in the construction of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army." Therefore, the specific task of the sixth period of the Anti-Japanese University was to cultivate the backbone for the construction of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. The main students coming to the school were cadres from the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Suicide Squad. Most of them were workers and peasants, which required the school to study how to adapt to the teaching methods for workers and peasants.

The opening of the sixth period was after the "December Political Incident," just when the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region had just broken away from the rule and sabotage of the stubborn elements, social order was chaotic, and the economy was in ruins. The school was in a very difficult situation, so the school actively helped to carry out local work, such as dispatching cadres and students to participate in the constitutional movement, social and cultural education, militia training, and armed construction, which played an active role in strengthening the construction of the base area. The main difficulty encountered during the entire period was the lack of supplies. Even high-quality grains like sorghum and black beans had to be carried from more than 100 miles away. Therefore, the large-scale grain-carrying movement became a major event of the sixth period. All students had to carry grain while studying to complete the learning tasks given by the Party.

In general, the Anti-Japanese University and its various branch schools were all in the midst of fierce anti-"sweeping" wars, tempering, developing, and learning. The school flag of the Anti-Japanese University had already flown from the banks of the Yellow River to the banks of the Yangtze River and the East China Sea.

**Welcoming Victory: The Seventh and Eighth Periods**

In January 1941, the Maolin Incident in Anhui occurred, and the crisis of internal war and surrender was unprecedentedly serious. The seventh period of the Anti-Japanese University began under such a situation.

The central school, according to the central policy, accepted the cadres of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army's regiments, battalions, and companies in this period and established the senior cadre course and the ordinary course. The basic characteristics of the seventh period of the Anti-Japanese University were that various regular systems were gradually established, and their effects were that the school's organization was reduced, but the work efficiency and work relationships were greatly improved. The number of cadres was reduced, but the work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility were greatly increased. The meticulousness, hard work, depth, and practicality of the work style were also further carried forward.

According to these policies, this period paid special attention to the precise formulation of the education plan and the review of teaching materials. Moreover, these works were carried out through collective discussions of relevant departments and teachers, so in four to five months, new teaching materials in military, political, and cultural aspects were mostly printed and completed. Not only did they supply the school, but they also supplied the troops. In cultivating the business ability of teachers, the system of teachers selecting a second course was established, and the experience of past teaching was sorted out and studied, achieving certain results.

Although the school had gained these rich experiences, due to the new development of the war situation, it was required to preserve and improve cadres and actively prepare for the counterattack, which became the main task of the eighth period of the Anti-Japanese University.

The eighth period of the Anti-Japanese University began on May 1, 1942, Labor Day. Soon after the opening, the entire school personnel were engaged in the fierce "May Anti-Sweeping" war. After two months of sharp struggle, they returned to their original station in Xingtai Jiangshui Town to carry out education. To implement the central policy of preserving and improving cadres, in the spring of 1943, the Anti-Japanese University returned from the frequently war-torn North China behind enemy lines to Suide in Shaanxi, directly under the leadership of the Central Committee, to carry out educational work with the Military Academy. At the same time, a large number of cadres drawn from various anti-Japanese base areas by the Central Committee were also concentrated in the central school. At that time, four large teams were organized, and in a relatively stable environment, their many years of combat experience and work experience were exchanged and sorted out.

The eighth period of the Anti-Japanese University had the longest study time, and its harvest was the greatest. After more than three years of intensive study, it graduated on the eve of Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, and marched to various battlefields to participate in the great battle of the total counterattack to defeat the Japanese invaders. The Anti-Japanese University itself was ordered to move to Northeast China and was renamed the Northeast Military and Political University in North An and Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, in the summer of 1946. Until after the liberation of the country in 1949, the historical mission of the Anti-Japanese University was completed. Its former branch schools and school cadres were reorganized into the Senior Infantry School, Ordinary Infantry School, or other military academies.

    回顾抗大总校的战斗历程
    张量
    50多年前，党中央和毛泽东同志亲自领导的抗大总校，汇集了红一、二、四3个方面军和陕北红军的精英。她的传统，她的作风，都是永远值得我们学习的。下面我将抗大学习、战斗、生产、劳动的光辉历程，叙述如下：
    艰苦缔造的一、二期
    抗大（原名“红大”）的第一期是从1936年6月1日开学到同年12月毕业的。为了发展“双十二”事变后抗日民族统一战线的大好形势，200多名经过军事、政治理论武装的革命干部，走上了各个战斗岗位，他们在继续争取国内和平，组织对日抗战的关键时刻，发挥了最光辉的作用。
    抗大的第二期是在“双十二”事变后于1937年1月20日开学到1937年“七七”事变爆发结业的。这时学校为了适应国内新的政治形势，即正式改名为——“中国人民抗日军事政治大学”，校址也由保安迁至延安。即由第一期的3个教员300左右的学生一跃成为1000多名学生、初具规模的大学校了。当着“芦沟桥”抗战炮声一响，1000多名最坚定的民族革命战士，立即奔赴前线，给万恶的日本强盗一个最响亮的回击。
    “抗大”一、二期的基本特点，可以说是毛泽东同志亲自精心培育，广大教、职、学员艰苦奋斗的结晶，它为往后的革命教育事业，打下了坚固的基础。毛泽东、周恩来、朱德、刘少奇、陈云等中央领导都曾到学校讲课作报告。例如毛泽东同志的光辉著作《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》，都由毛泽东同志在抗大一、二期对学员亲自作过讲授。
    那时，为了克服教材、课堂和校舍的困难，抗大做了艰苦的努力。缺乏教材，就由有实践经验的学员、教员共同座谈讨论、自己编写；没有课堂，山峪、场院就是自然课堂；学生没有坐凳，拣起破砖砌个台子便是坐凳；两个膝盖就是学生听课记笔记的唯一桌台。
    抗大一、二期的学生，都是经过党的长期培养，在国内革命战争中涌现出来的英雄人物，他们艰苦卓绝，身经百战，有丰富的革命战争经验和实践经验，其中好多人在国内革命战争时期任过团长、师长、军长，甚至更高的职务。例如：罗荣桓、罗瑞卿、张际春、苏振华、胡耀邦、何长工、张爱萍等同志，都先后在抗大的一、二期学习过，其中许多同志还比较长时期的参加了学校的组建和领导工作。他们既是学员，又是建设学校的大师。
    抗大一、二期的主要贡献，一是汇集了红军3个方面军和陕北红军的领导骨干和各级干部，这对于总结全部红军的战斗经验，融合各个方面军的传统与作风，使之发扬光大，成为我党我军优良的传统作风，起了决定的作用；二是经过第二期对于几百个外来青年学生的教育提高，不仅在政治上使他们懂得了抗日民族统一战线的重要性，而且在军事上使他们学得了必要的战略战术知识，特别是游击战术和政治工作的知识，在思想行动和生活作风方面，给了他们以严格的锻炼和要求，这就给党和学校在争取、教育、改造知识分子的工作方面，创造了良好的经验；三是毛泽东同志所要求的团结，紧张，严肃，活泼的校风，经过新老干部的互相学习和交融，也取得了很好的成绩，从而给尔后的学校工作，树立了优良的传统与作风。
      迅猛发展的三、四期
    “七七”事变后，随着华北抗日烽火的激起。就在1937年的“八·一”“抗大”第三期开学了。经过8个多月的战斗学习，到1938年4月又输送了两千多名干部到达抗日前线。
    抗大第四期的新生，1938年4月16日在延安举行开学典礼，这是在中国共产党领导下的抗大，向全国人民表示抗战必胜的决心，对日本帝国主义进行示威的大会。经过几个月的短暂学习，于1938年的“八一”建军节提前毕业，就有1400多名学生去参加了保卫大武汉的血战。
    抗大三、四期由于学员激增，所以校址必须扩散，北至蟠龙、瓦窑堡，南至洛川，向西更伸至甘肃的庆阳，这是学校的发达兴旺时期。
    当时对于“抗大”教育事业具有决定意义的大事，就是在抗大三期开学不久，于1937年10月，中国共产党抗大第一次代表大会在延安正式开幕了，会议的中心任务是深入开展反对张国焘错误路线的斗争，进一步团结一、二、四3个方面军的广大干部，同时对于争取、教育革命的知识青年，也引起了广泛的注意，会议经过民主选举，正式成立了中国共产党抗大党务委员会。加强了党对学校的全面领导。
    抗大三、四期的基本特点是，响应毛泽东同志“学好本领上前线”的号召，以战斗的姿态，在战斗的环境下进行战斗的学习。当时的学员有的是来自全国的知识青年，有的是来自前线八路军的干部，他们一面紧张的学习，一面随时准备奔赴前线，所以有的同学入校不久，就因战争急需，又被调赴前线，他们每个人在调令面前，没有任何个人犹豫，只有勇敢向前，表现了革命战士的光荣本色。
    抗大三、四期的收获是突出的：第一，毛泽东同志为抗大制订的3条教育方针“坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术”，更加明确；第二，适应当时战争的要求，更加强化了对学生的军事教育与严格的军事生活。为此，从第三期开始，曾成立了专门培养军事干部的军事队，为往后加强学校军事教育，打下了一个坚实的基础；第三，为了适应学校的发展，改进学校的教学方法和管理方法，从第三期起，曾从学生中有计划的抽调培养了不少的学校工作干部和教员。在举办教员训练队的基础上，曾分别办有政工训练队、区队长训练队。另外，又有参谋训练队、敌军工作训练队，给创校建军培养了许多教学人才，加强了学校的领导；第四，继续发扬着艰苦奋斗的传统和团结紧张的战斗作风。例如三期开始，学员猛增，校舍不足，就凭这群青年的双手，经过不满两星期的劳动，就挖出了170多孔窑洞，使得当时两千多人的两个大队，立即有了新的校舍。
    继续壮大的五、六期
    抗大第五期的学生是在1938年秋冬武汉失守前后就大量的来校了，而正式开学，是在1939年的“一·二八”抗战纪念日隆重举行的。当时抗日战争已进入一个新的阶段。在1938年秋冬之交，中共扩大的“六中全会”上，毛泽东同志和党中央指出，抗战新阶段的到来，特别要强调扩大和开展敌后的游击战争，建立和巩固更多的抗日根据地，并要求在经济上强调自力更生的重要性。因此，要求抗大培养干部的工作，要进一步与八路军、新四军在敌后的斗争紧密配合起来。由于这种斗争形势的激发，全国广大的爱国青年，虽然处在日寇与反共派的前后夹击和层层封锁阻拦的情况下，而他们的心总是向往着延安，他们曾冒着国民党警察特务的拦阻和集中营的囚禁，最终还是涌入了延安。“抗大抗大”真是“越抗越大”。抗大五期的全盛时期，曾经扩大到8个大队，每个大队的学生都在千人以上。特别是代表新中国妇女先锋的女生，也不断地壮大，曾单独成立了一个“抗大第八大队”，引起中外人士的注目。
    抗大第五期为了实现新任务，曾经采取了几项重要措施：（1）深入传达“六中全会”的决议，学校党委的政治部派负责同志分头到各大队传达、宣讲，把它看作是最生动的马列主义的教育和学校执行新任务的思想准备。（2）组成第一、第二两个分校，派赴华北敌后作为开展敌后抗战教育的两支先遣队。这是抗战史上的创举。目的是配合前线的抗日战争，使学校的理论学习能够和实际打成一片。（3）学校工作大检查——这是抗大创立以来将近3年的一次全面工作总结，从1939年1月15日到3月15日，整整进行了两个月，检查范围，从学校的教育工作、政治工作一直到行政管理、供给卫生及其他各方面的工作，从而提高了学校干部对学校全面工作的认识和工作能力，检查了缺点，发扬了成绩，确定了改进以后工作的明确方针。（4）为了粉碎敌人对于边区的经济封锁，响应毛主席党中央关于开展大生产运动的号召，全校师生动员起来，积极参加开荒、下种、施肥、锄草等活动，并决心以开垦和种植2万亩土地，生产3300担粮食的成绩，献给陕甘宁边区。（5）为了坚持华北敌后的抗战，大量的培养部队中的干部，中央决定抗大总校随即深入晋察冀边区，坚持抗战教育。至1939年底，第五期学生全部毕业即分配到八路军和新四军中去了。
    抗大总校在晋察冀住了4个多月，于1940年2月，依照原定目的，通过了正太铁路的封锁线，转移至晋察冀豫边区太行山区，这时第一分校已由太南迁往山东，经过与一分校的留守大队的合并与准备工作。就在1940年4月15日，于山西武乡的蟠龙镇，举行了第六期的开学典礼，彭德怀同志到大会讲了话，指出：中央要求“抗大在建设八路军、新四军事业上要起骨干的作用”。所以抗大第六期的具体任务就是为八路军新四军培养建军骨干。来校学习的主要是八路军新四军以及决死队的干部。他们大多数是工农分子，这就要求学校研究如何适应工农分子的教学方法了。
    第六期开学是在“十二月政变”之后，正当晋冀鲁豫边区脱离顽固分子的统治和破坏不久，社会秩序紊乱，经济凋敝，学校处境十分困难，于是学校便积极的帮助开展地方工作，如在宪政运动，社会文化教育，民兵训练与武装建设等方面，都派了干部与学员进行具体帮助，这对于加强根据地的建设，起了积极的作用。全期遇到的主要困难就是缺乏给养，连高粱黑豆这些杂粮还要到百里之外去背，因此大规模的背粮运动，便
  成了六期的一件大事，所有学员只有一面背粮，一面学习，来完成党给予的学习任务。
    总的来说，抗大总校和各个分校都先后处在剧烈的反“扫荡”战争中，锻炼着、发展着、学习着，抗大的校旗，已经由黄河之滨飘扬到长江和东海之滨了。
    迎接胜利的七、八期
    1941年1月，皖南茂林事变发生，内战投降的危机空前严重，抗大的第七期就是在这样的形势下开始的。
    总校根据中央的方针，这一期接收了八路军、新四军团、营、连干部，成立了上干科和普通科。抗大七期的基本特点是各种正规化制度逐步建立，其效果是学校机构缩小了，但工作效率、工作关系却大大提高了和改进了。干部减少了，但工作情绪和责任心却大为增长了。工作作风上的细致性、艰苦性、深入性、切实性等等也更加发扬了。
    根据这些方针这一期特别重视教育计划的精密制订和教材编审工作，而且这些工作的进行都是经过有关部门和教员的集体讨论的，所以在4、5个月之内，军事、政治、文化各方面的新教材都能够大部编印完毕。不但供给学校而且供给了部队，在培养教员业务能力方面，建立教员选修第二门课的制度，以及整理研究过去教学的经验，都取得了一定的成绩。
    虽然学校取得了上面这些丰富的经验，但因战争形势新的发展，要求保存提高干部，积极准备反攻，这便成了抗大第八期的主要任务。
    抗大第八期是在1942年“五一”劳动节开学的。开学不久，全校人员即投入了“五月反扫荡”的残酷战争中，经过两个月的尖锐斗争，仍然胜利的返回了原驻地邢台浆水镇进行教育。为了执行中央关于保存、提高干部的方针，1943年春，抗大总校从战争频繁的华北敌后，经过敌人层层的封锁线重新返回陕北绥德与军事学院合并，在中央的直接领导下进行教育工作。同时中央从各个抗日根据地抽调的大量干部也多集中在总校，当时共编4个大队，在较安定的环境下，使他们多年的战斗经验和工作经验得以交流和整理。
    抗大八期学习时间最长，经过党的整风运动，它的收获也最大，前后经过3年多的紧张学习，就在1945年“八·一五”日本投降的前夕全部毕业，开赴前线各个战场，参加了击败日寇举行总反攻的伟大战斗。而抗大总校本身，又奉命调赴东北，于1946年的夏季在黑龙江的北安、齐齐哈尔改为东北军政大学。直到1949年全国解放之后，抗大的历史任务完成了，它过去所属的分校和学校干部，又分别组成了高级步兵学校、普通步兵学校或其他军事院校了。
