A group of college students visited the "Hard Sixth Company" for study and learning, and their experiences in the military camp were profound, leading them to reflect on the past and draw lessons.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on August 2nd, "The People's Liberation Army is truly the most beloved people of the new era, and they are our excellent examples to learn from!" This was the praise from 12 students from eight universities, including Fudan University, East China Normal University, and Zhejiang University, who visited the "Heroic Hard Sixth Company" of the Hangzhou garrison on the eve of August 1st. They were the first group of college students to visit the Hard Sixth Company after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital.

These 12 college students from Hangzhou returned home for the summer vacation. Their local neighborhood committees specially organized them to visit the Hard Sixth Company. After learning that during the turmoil, some students in Hangzhou had repeatedly gone to the company to post leaflets and make speeches, and the officers and soldiers had firmly stopped and persuaded them, the students deeply admired the soldiers' high political awareness and ability to discern political right from wrong. When the political instructor Fan Hongqing showed them a letter of repentance signed by a student named Xiaobin from Zhejiang University and discussed it with the college students, Ro Zhirong, a student from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Shanghai Jiaotong University, sighed, "Our feelings now are the same as those of this student Xiaobin. We are full of self-blame and admiration for the People's Liberation Army." Instructor Fan enthusiastically led the college students to visit the company's honor room and the martyrs' hall, telling them about the company's glorious traditions, introducing the company's experiences in political and ideological work, and sharing the advanced deeds of various model soldiers in the company. The college students also had a frank discussion with the soldiers about their understanding and feelings of studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party. They expressed their desire to reflect on their past, learn from their experiences, and humbly learn the good thoughts, good styles, and good virtues of the People's Liberation Army.

    一批大学生到硬六连参观学习
    进了军营感受深刻　反思过去吸取教训
    据新华社杭州8月2日电（通讯员陶广平、贾生龙）“解放军无愧是新时代最可爱的人，我们学习的好榜样！”这是“八一”前夕上海复旦大学、华东师范大学、杭州大学等8所大学的12名学生到杭州驻军某部“英雄硬六连”参观学习后，发出的赞语。他们是在平息首都反革命暴乱后，来硬六连参观见学的第一批大学生。
    这12名杭州籍大学生回家度暑假后，他们所在街道居委会特意组织他们赴硬六连参观见学。当他们得知在动乱期间，杭州一些学生多次到六连贴传单、搞演说，干部战士坚决予以制止和说服等情况后，对战士们具有高度的政治觉悟和辨别政治是非能力感到由衷的敬佩。当指导员范洪庆拿出一封署名为浙江大学学生晓彬写给连队的忏悔信同大学生们一起讨论时，上海交通大学机械系大学生罗志荣感慨地说：“我们现在的心情正和这位晓彬同学一样，对自己充满着自责之心，对解放军充满着爱戴之情。”范指导员热情地带领大学生们参观连队荣誉室和烈士灵堂，给他们讲连队的光荣传统，介绍连队开展政治思想工作的经验和连队各类标兵的先进事迹。大学生们还和战士们一起畅谈了学习党的十三届四中全会精神的体会和感受。他们表示要反思自己的过去，吸取经验教训，虚心学习解放军的好思想、好作风、好品德。
