Edition: 1

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the decision on cleaning up and rectifying companies in October 1988, various regions and departments have done a lot of work and achieved certain results. However, due to an inadequate understanding of the arduousness and complexity of cleaning up and rectifying companies, the measures taken were not clear and forceful enough. Some places and departments hesitated and delayed action, and the work of cleaning up and rectifying has not yet achieved the expected results due to the interference of turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. To further strengthen, improve, and complete the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies, the following decisions are made:

1. **Guidelines for Further Cleaning Up and Rectifying Companies**

Companies are a product and an indispensable organizational form of the development of socialist commodity economy. The establishment and development of companies have played an active role in promoting production, activating the market, and revitalizing the economy. However, due to the lack of firm implementation of the Central Committee's decision that party and government organs should not engage in business and enterprise operations, and the blind promotion of "income generation" by organs and public institutions, a large number of companies were established in the circulation sector without proper conditions. Coupled with incomplete regulations and weak management and supervision, this has led to the excessive and disorderly development of companies. Some companies have chaotic operations and implement high wages and benefits that are not in line with China's national conditions. A few individuals have used their positions to engage in embezzlement, theft, speculation, bribery, and other illegal activities, seriously disrupting the clean governance of the government and the establishment of a sound socialist economic order, exacerbating social inequities, and affecting social stability. To promote the healthy development of socialist planned commodity economy and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, it is necessary to seriously clean up and rectify the existing problems in companies. This is not only an important part of rectifying the economic environment, economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms, but also a crucial measure to resolutely combat corruption and boost the morale of the Party and the people. It is not just an economic issue but a political issue of great concern to the entire country. Cleaning up and rectifying companies is not about abolishing companies or denying their positive role in economic life, but about solving the problems in the operation and development of companies, changing the current chaotic situation, and better activating and developing the economy. Due to the different responsibilities of various departments, the significant differences among various industries, and the uneven economic development in various regions, as well as the deepening of economic system reform, the degree of excessive and disorderly development of companies varies, and the size of the problems they face is also very different, making the situation quite complex. In the process of cleaning up and rectifying, the central government organs should take the lead and set an example. Various regions and departments should, in accordance with the overall requirements of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, combine their own actual situations, take concrete, clear, and effective measures, and seriously and responsibly carry out the work. The leadership at all levels should have great determination, take forceful measures, grasp the time, do detailed work, and pay attention to not creating new social instability factors.

2. **Basic Requirements for Further Cleaning Up and Rectifying**

First, through cleaning up and rectifying, resolutely dissolve and merge companies that do not meet social needs, are redundant, lack the conditions for establishment, have serious violations of laws and discipline, and those that have been operating poorly for a long time, have incurred heavy losses, and are already insolvent. The focus should be on dissolving companies established by party and government organs at all levels, and companies in the circulation sector that are excessively and disorderly engaged in commercial wholesale, foreign trade, material supply, and financial operations. Second, through cleaning up and rectifying, seriously investigate and deal with illegal and disciplinary cases, especially those with significant social impact involving leading cadres at or above the county level. Third, through cleaning up and rectifying, gradually establish and improve the various management regulations and systems for companies, especially financial, tax, and audit systems, to ensure the healthy development of companies.

The work should be concentrated, time should be grasped, and the above main tasks should be completed by the end of March next year. The remaining tasks should continue to be pushed forward, and the management and supervision of companies should gradually be brought under the rule of law by the end of this year.

3. **Party and Government Organs, State Power Organs, Administrative Organs, Judicial Organs, Procuratorial Organs, and Mass Organizations and Social Groups**

All of the above are strictly prohibited from using administrative funds, public institution funds, special allocations, extra-budgetary funds, bank loans, self-raised funds, and any other means to raise funds to establish companies, or to invest in and hold shares in companies. Companies that have already been established in this manner, including those that have already completed financial detachment procedures during the cleaning up and rectifying process, should generally be dissolved. A few that meet social needs and are genuinely well-run can be retained, but they must completely sever ties with the original organs and groups and be managed by the corresponding competent departments under the principle of industry-based management. The industry-based management plan should be proposed by the leading group for cleaning up and rectifying companies at each level and submitted to the same-level party committee and government for approval.

Cadres of party and state organs who are still holding concurrent positions in companies (including those who are no longer in current positions but have not yet completed retirement procedures) should strictly follow the relevant regulations of the Central Committee and complete the procedures for resigning from one of the positions. Those who delay for any reason should be dealt with according to party and government discipline. When resigning from concurrent positions in companies, the handover work must be properly handled. For those holding concurrent positions in foreign-invested enterprises, the "Notice of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council on the Cleaning Up of Party and State Cadres Holding Concurrent Positions in Companies (Enterprises)" (Zhongbanfa [1989] No. 1) should be followed. This work should be organized and implemented by the organizational departments of party committees or government personnel departments according to the authority over cadres.

4. **Companies in the Circulation Sector Engaged in Commercial Wholesale, Foreign Trade, Material Supply, and Financial Operations**

The situation is particularly complex, and the task of cleaning up and rectifying is particularly heavy. The relevant departments and regions should pay special attention and strengthen guidance. The Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the Ministry of Materials, and the People's Bank of China should quickly formulate specific regulations and submit them to the State Council for approval and implementation.

5. **Companies Engaged in Production and Operation, Technological Development, Consulting Services, and Labor Service Companies**

These companies should also be seriously cleaned up and rectified. This type of company can only sell self-produced products, engage in technology transfer, knowledge services, and labor services, and is strictly prohibited from engaging in commercial wholesale operations unrelated to their business. Those that meet social needs and are well-run should be further improved, and those that should be developed should continue to be developed. Those that do not meet the conditions for establishment, are redundant, or add unnecessary links should be resolutely dissolved; those that are determined to be retained should have their business scope re-approved, strictly implement financial systems, and strengthen management and supervision.

At the same time, private investment enterprises that are registered as state-owned or collective companies should be seriously cleaned up, and the nature of ownership should be strictly distinguished. Private investment or joint investment private enterprises should not be registered as state-owned or collective companies. Those who violate this should be held accountable by the relevant parties and approval authorities.

6. **Companies to be Dissolved and Merged**

Should first cease operations, and the competent departments should establish liquidation organizations to handle the settlement of debts and assets. It is strictly forbidden to withdraw funds, privatize assets, or waste resources. The Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Personnel should formulate specific regulations for the settlement of assets and the placement of personnel, and handle them uniformly. If there are disputes, they should be coordinated and adjudicated by the leading group for cleaning up and rectifying companies.

Companies that are determined to be dissolved and merged should not sign new contracts from the date of approval for dissolution and merger; original contracts already signed, especially those involving foreign parties, should be continued to be executed by the original approving competent departments or designated and agreed-upon other Chinese companies, to safeguard the interests of foreign investors.

For the personnel of state-owned companies that are determined to be dissolved and merged, they should be arranged and placed in a coordinated manner. Cleaning up and rectifying is a requirement for all companies. Dissolving and merging a batch of companies is for the overall situation, to change the current excessive and disorderly situation of companies, and to promote the healthier development of socialist commodity economy. When re-employing personnel from dissolved and merged companies, the Party's cadre policy should be implemented, and they should not be treated with distrust, nor should they be discriminated against.

7. **Seriously Investigate and Deal with Illegal and Disciplinary Cases**

Investigations should be based on facts and conducted according to the law. Companies with problems should be investigated, and individuals with problems should be investigated. No leniency should be shown. Especially for party and government organs, leading cadres, and their direct relatives who use their power for personal gain and participate in the illegal buying and selling of important production materials and durable consumer goods, no matter who they are, the cases should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with according to the law. For cases that are difficult to investigate and have strong public reactions, the higher-level organs should promptly send work teams to conduct a thorough investigation. Within the time limit specified by the state's judicial and supervisory organs, those who have committed embezzlement, bribery, and speculation but have confessed and actively returned the ill-gotten gains should be dealt with leniently, reduced in punishment, or exempted from punishment according to the law; otherwise, they should be severely punished according to the law. Those who interfere with the investigation process, cover up, and protect should be publicly exposed and severely dealt with.

8. **From the State Council to Local Governments**

In principle, no new companies should be directly managed. Companies that are currently directly managed by the government should be managed by the relevant competent departments under the principle of industry-based and business-based management.

Companies generally should not have administrative management functions. Companies that currently have a mix of government and enterprise functions must strictly separate operational rights and administrative rights, and those that cannot be solved immediately should be gradually transitioned in a planned manner. In the future, no new companies with a mix of government and enterprise functions should be approved.

9. **Existing Special Approvals for Certain Companies**

Regarding tax reductions and exemptions, bank loan interest rates, and business scope, any that have not yet been canceled should be canceled from the date of this decision. In the future, necessary preferential treatments for certain companies should be strictly implemented according to the relevant laws and regulations of the state and industrial policies. No individual has the right to approve on their own. Those who are personally approved by leaders should be refused by the relevant functional departments.

10. **Gradually Adjust the Treatment of Company Employees**

The principle is that companies authorized by the state to exercise certain administrative management functions should implement the wage, bonus, and labor insurance and welfare systems of state organs; state-owned companies that mainly engage in operations and have some administrative management functions should implement the relevant systems of similar state-owned enterprises; other state-owned and collective companies should implement the relevant systems of similar state-owned and collective enterprises, respectively. The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance should quickly formulate specific regulations according to this spirit.

11. **The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office**

Should work with relevant departments to quickly study and further formulate and improve the relevant regulations. The drafting of the relevant regulations on company management should be completed by the end of this year and submitted to the State Council for approval and promulgation. At the same time, the "Company Law" should be quickly formulated.

12. **During the Cleaning Up and Rectifying Period**

No new companies, except for production-type and technological development-type companies, should be approved. Companies that are retained after cleaning up and rectifying should strictly follow the relevant policies and regulations, clarify the business scope, and re-register and issue certificates in conjunction with the annual industrial and commercial inspection, to engage in business activities according to the law. The industrial and commercial administrative, financial, tax, banking, audit, and supervisory departments should strengthen the administrative management and guidance and supervision of various companies.

In the future, the establishment of new companies, especially those engaged in commercial wholesale, foreign trade, material supply, and financial operations, should be strictly approved according to the law. No individual or unauthorized approval unit should interfere with the approval, examination and approval, and registration and registration of companies. Those who are personally approved by leaders should be refused by the approval units.

13. **Fully Mobilize and Rely on the Masses**

Greatly strengthen and give full play to the role of reporting centers at all levels. Organize people from all walks of life, including deputies to the National People's Congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and members of democratic parties, to participate in the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies. Give full play to the role of the media, timely report the progress of cleaning up and rectifying companies in various regions and departments, the results of the investigation and handling of illegal and disciplinary cases, and the problems existing in the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies, strengthen social public opinion supervision, and promote the smooth progress of the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies.

14. **Party Organizations, Governments, and Departments at All Levels**

Should seriously implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, strengthen organizational leadership, include the cleaning up and rectifying of companies in the important agenda, and the main leaders should personally take charge. The relevant departments should work closely together and cooperate closely, resolutely remove all interference and obstacles, seriously complete the various tasks of further cleaning up and rectifying companies, and absolutely not engage in formalism or go through the motions.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have established the National Leading Group for Cleaning Up and Rectifying Companies, with the office set up in the State Council, and strengthened and supplemented the office's forces. Various regions and departments should also strengthen and supplement the leading and office organs.

To ensure that the various tasks of cleaning up and rectifying companies are truly implemented, the governors (chairmen of autonomous regions, mayors of municipalities directly under the Central Government) of various provinces and the ministers of various departments should be responsible.

15. **Various Regions and Departments**

Should report the results of cleaning up and rectifying companies to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council by April 30, 1990.

The further cleaning up and rectifying of companies established by the military should be specifically regulated by the Central Military Commission according to the spirit of this decision.

The relevant regulations issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and various relevant departments in the past, if they are inconsistent with this decision, should be uniformly governed by this decision. Companies that have already been determined to be retained and re-registered before the issuance of this decision should be carefully re-examined by various regions and departments according to this decision.

    中共中央国务院
    关于进一步清理整顿公司的决定
    （一九八九年八月十七日）
    自1988年10月中共中央、国务院作出关于清理整顿公司的决定以来，各地区、各部门做了不少工作，取得了一定成绩。但由于对清理整顿公司的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，措施不够明确有力，一些地方和部门犹豫观望，行动迟缓，再加上动乱和反革命暴乱的干扰，清理整顿工作还远没有取得预期的效果。为了进一步把清理整顿公司的工作抓紧、抓好、抓到底，特作如下决定：
    一、进一步清理整顿公司的指导方针。公司是发展社会主义商品经济的产物和必不可少的经济组织形式。公司的建立和发展，对于促进生产，活跃市场，繁荣经济，起了积极的作用。但是，由于近几年来贯彻中央关于党政机关不准经商办企业的决定不坚决，盲目提倡机关和事业单位“创收”，在流通领域中不顾条件不适当地成立了一大批公司，再加上法规不完善，管理和监督不力，导致了公司的发展过多过滥。一些公司经营混乱和实行脱离我国国情的高工资、高福利，少数人利用职权贪污、盗窃、投机倒把、行贿受贿，严重干扰了为政清廉和建立健全社会主义的经济秩序，加剧了社会分配不公的矛盾，影响了社会安定。为了促进社会主义有计划的商品经济的健康发展，保证改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行，必须对目前公司存在的问题进行认真的清理整顿。这既是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的重要内容，又是坚决惩治腐败、振奋党心民心的一项重要措施，不仅是经济领域的问题，而且是全国上下十分关注的政治问题。清理整顿公司，绝不是不要办公司，也不是否定公司在经济生活中的积极作用，而是为了解决公司经营和发展中存在的问题，改变目前的混乱状况，更好地搞活经济，发展经济。由于各部门职责不同，各行各业差别很大，各地区经济发展很不平衡，加上经济体制改革正在深化，因此各地公司发展中过多过滥的程度不等，存在问题的大小也很不一样，情况比较复杂。在清理整顿工作中，中央国家机关要带头做好，做出表率。各地区、各部门要按照党中央、国务院总的要求，结合自己的实际情况，采取具体、明确、切实有效的措施，认真负责地进行。各级领导决心要大，措施要有力，时间要抓紧，工作要做细，并且切实注意不要造成新的社会不安定因素。
    二、进一步清理整顿的基本要求。一是通过清理整顿，坚决撤并一批不符合社会需要、重复设置、不具备开办条件、严重违法乱纪的公司，以及长期经营不善、严重亏损、已经资不抵债的公司，重点是砍掉各级党政机关开办的公司，流通领域中过多、过滥的从事商业批发、对外贸易、物资供应的公司和金融性公司。二是通过清理整顿，认真查处违法违纪案件，特别是查处社会影响大的有县级以上领导干部参与的大案要案。三是通过清理整顿，逐步建立健全公司的各项管理法规和制度，特别是财会、税收和审计制度，以保证公司的健康发展。
    要集中力量，抓紧时间，在明年3月底以前完成上述主要工作，在今年年底以前首先基本完成公司的撤并任务。未竟事项要继续抓紧进行，并逐步把对公司的管理和监督纳入法制轨道。
    三、各级党的机关、国家权力机关、行政机关、审判机关、检察机关和群众组织、社会团体，一律不得用行政经费、事业费、专项拨款、预算外资金、银行贷款、自有资金和以任何方式集资开办公司，也不得向公司投资入股。现在已经开办的这类公司，包括清理整顿中已与机关、团体办理了财务脱钩手续的公司，绝大部分应予撤销。少数符合社会需要，确实办得好的，可以保留，但必须与原机关、团体完全脱离关系，一律由相应的主管部门实行行业归口管理。归口管理方案由各级清理整顿公司领导小组提出，报请同级党委和政府批准。
    凡仍在公司兼职的党和国家机关干部（含已不担任现职、尚未办理离休退休手续的干部），应严格按照中央有关规定办完辞去一头职务的手续，不得以任何理由拖延，凡借故拖延者要按违犯党纪政纪论处。辞去公司兼职时，必须妥善做好交接工作。在外商投资企业中兼任职人员，按《中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅关于清理党和国家机关干部在公司（企业）兼职有关问题的通知》（中办发〔1989〕1号）执行。此项工作由各级党委组织部门或政府人事部门按干部管理权限组织实施和监督检查。
    四、流通领域中从事商业批发、对外贸易、物资供应的公司和金融性公司，情况特别复杂，清理整顿任务特别重，有关部门和各地区要特别重视，加强指导。责成商业部、经贸部、物资部和中国人民银行尽快分别制定具体规定，报国务院批准后实施。
    五、从事生产经营、科技开发、咨询服务的公司，以及劳动服务公司等，也要认真清理整顿。这类公司只能经销自产产品，进行技术转让、知识服务、劳动服务，一律不得从事与自己业务无关的商业批发经营活动。符合社会需要和办得好的，应进一步办好，该发展的仍要发展。凡不具备开办条件、重复设置或增加不必要环节的，要坚决撤销；确定保留的，要重新核定经营范围，严格财会制度，加强管理监督。
    同时，要认真清理以国营、集体公司为名的私人投资企业，严格划分所有制性质。凡私人投资或合伙投资兴办的私营企业，不准作为国营、集体所有制公司办理登记，违者应追究当事人及审核、审批机关的责任。
    六、确定撤并的公司应先行停业，由主管部门成立清算组织负责清理债权债务和资产关系，严禁抽走资金，私分资产，挥霍浪费。关于资产清理和人员安置问题，由财政部、人民银行、国有资产管理局、劳动部、人事部等部门制定具体规定，统一处理。如有矛盾，由清理整顿公司领导小组协调裁决。
    确定撤并的公司，从核准撤并之日起不准签订新的合同；原已签订的合同特别是涉外合同，由原批准成立的主管部门继续执行，或指定并经外方同意的其他中方公司代理执行，保障外商利益。
    对于确定撤并的全民所有制公司的人员，应予统筹安排，妥善安置。清理整顿是对所有公司的要求，撤并一批公司是从大局出发，为了改变目前公司过多过滥的状况，以利于社会主义商品经济更健康地发展。对被撤并公司的人员在重新安置工作时，应执行党的干部政策，不应对他们采取不信任态度，更不得加以歧视。
    七、认真查处违法违纪案件。查处中应以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，依法进行。哪个公司有问题清查哪个公司，谁有问题清查谁，不得姑息。特别是党政机关、领导干部及其直系亲属以权谋私、参与倒买倒卖重要生产资料和耐用消费品的大案要案，不管是什么人，都要一查到底，依法处理。对于查处工作需要，特别是查处阻力大、群众反映强烈的单位，上级机关应及时派出工作组，彻底清查。在国家司法和监察部门规定的期限内，对犯有贪污、受贿、投机倒把行为，但能坦白自首、积极退赃者，依法从轻、减轻或免于处罚，否则，依法从严惩处。对办案过程中说情袒护、徇私包庇者，要公开揭露，严肃处理。
    八、从国务院到各级地方政府，今后原则上不再直接管理公司。现在由政府直接管理的公司，改由有关主管部门实行行业、业务归口管理。
    公司一般不得兼有行政管理职能。现有政企不分的公司，必须将经营权和行政权严格分开，一时难以解决的应有计划地逐步过渡。今后一律不得批准成立新的政企不分的公司。
    九、现有对某些公司特批的减免税、银行贷款利率和经营范围等方面的优惠待遇，凡尚未取消的，从本决定下达之日起一律取消。今后对某些公司给予必要的优惠待遇，应严格按国家有关法规和产业政策执行，任何个人无权擅自审批。凡领导个人擅自批准的，有关职能部门有权拒绝执行。
    十、逐步调整公司职工待遇。调整的原则是，承担国家授权行使某些行政管理职能的公司，执行国家机关的工资、奖金、劳保福利制度；以经营为主、兼有部分行政管理职能的全民所有制公司，执行同类国营企业的有关制度；其他全民所有制公司和集体所有制公司，分别按照同类国营企业和集体企业的有关制度执行。责成劳动部、财政部根据这一精神尽快制定具体规定。
    十一、责成国务院法制局会同有关部门抓紧研究，进一步制定和完善相应法规。在今年年底以前完成有关公司管理方面条例的起草工作，交国务院审定和颁发。同时，要抓紧制定《公司法》。
    十二、清理整顿期间，一律不得批准新成立除生产型、科技开发型以外的公司。清理整顿后保留下来的公司，必须严格按照有关政策法规，明确经营范围，结合工商年检登记，重新注册发证，依法从事经营活动。工商行政管理、财政、税务、银行、审计、监察等部门要切实加强对各类公司的行政管理和指导监督。
    今后成立新的公司，特别是成立从事商业批发、对外贸易、物资供应的公司和金融性公司，必须依法审批，从严掌握。任何个人和非授权审批单位均不得干预公司的审批、核准和登记注册工作，凡领导个人擅自批准的，审批单位有权拒绝。
    十三、要充分发动和紧紧依靠群众，大力发挥和加强各级举报中心的作用。要组织社会各界人士包括人大代表、政协委员、民主党派成员等参加清理整顿公司的工作。要发挥新闻媒介的作用，及时报道各地区、各部门清理整顿公司的进展情况、违法违纪案件的查处结果以及清理整顿工作中存在的问题，加强社会舆论监督，促进清理整顿公司工作的顺利进行。
    十四、各级党组织、各级政府、各部门要认真贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，切实加强组织领导，把清理整顿公司列入重要议事日程，主要领导要亲自抓，有关部门要大力协同、密切配合，坚决排除一切干扰和阻力，认真完成进一步清理整顿公司的各项任务，决不能搞形式主义，决不能走过场。
    党中央、国务院成立全国清理整顿公司领导小组，办事机构设在国务院，并加强和充实办事机构的力量。各地区、各部门也要充实加强领导机构和办事机构。
    为了保证清理整顿公司的各项任务真正落到实处，要求各省省长（自治区主席、直辖市市长）和各部部长负责。
    十五、各地区、各部门应将清理整顿公司的结果于1990年4月底前报告党中央、国务院。
    军队所办公司的进一步清理整顿，由中央军委根据本决定精神作出具体规定。
    党中央、国务院和各有关部门过去下达的有关规定，凡与本决定不一致的，一律以本决定为准。本决定下达前已确定保留和重新登记注册的公司，各地区、各部门都应根据本决定进行认真的复查。
