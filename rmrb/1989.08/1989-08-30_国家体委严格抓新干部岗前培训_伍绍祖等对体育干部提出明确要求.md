The State Sports Commission strictly implements pre-service training for new cadres. Wu Shaozu and others put forward clear requirements for sports cadres.

    The State Sports Commission has organized a 14-day pre-service training program for nearly 80 college graduates assigned to the commission's units in Beijing, 400 days before the 11th Asian Games. The commission treats this as a major task. Wu Shaozu, the director, and deputy directors Yuan Weimin and Zhang Caizhen, held sincere and frank discussions with them.

    Wu Shaozu put forward clear requirements for how to be a qualified sports cadre. He said that one must be: objective and impartial, politically firm, open-minded, diligent in investigation and research, democratic and centralized, united and cooperative, hardworking, clean in governance, and eager to learn. Yuan Weimin, combining his own experiences, talked about how sports cadres should be confident; correctly assess themselves, not be self-righteous; be diligent and hardworking, prepared to endure hardships; be entrepreneurial, dare to challenge difficulties, and create new situations.

    Many of these new comrades will directly serve the Asian Games, and high demands are placed on them. Relevant responsible persons from the Asian Games Organizing Committee also gave them a comprehensive introduction to the preparations for the Asian Games and the serious and responsible work attitude.

    Through political and ideological education and professional knowledge and vocational ethics training, they learned about the truth from the turmoil to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, recognized the ideological harm of bourgeois liberalization, and had a more comprehensive understanding of the development of the sports industry and its goals and tasks. They expressed their willingness to contribute to the Asian Games and strive to build a strong sports nation. This concentrated pre-service training has achieved good results, and the commission is seriously summarizing the experience.

    国家体委严格抓新干部岗前培训
    伍绍祖等对体育干部提出明确要求
    本报讯　距第十一届亚运会召开400天之际，分配到国家体委在京单位近80名高校毕业生为适应新形势，进行了为期14天的岗前严格培训。国家体委对此当作一件大事抓，体委主任伍绍祖、副主任袁伟民、张彩珍，先后同他们进行了真诚、坦率的座谈。
    伍绍祖对如何做一个体育干部提出了明确要求。他说，要做一个合格的体育干部，必须做到：实事求是，大公无私，政治坚定，思想解放，调查研究，民主集中，团结协作，艰苦奋斗，为政清廉，努力学习。袁伟民结合体会，谈到做体育干部要自信；要正确估计自己，不要自以为是；要勤学苦钻，准备吃苦；要艰苦创业，敢于向困难挑战，开创新局面。
    这批新同志中，有不少人要直接为亚运会服务，对他们要求很高。亚运会组委会有关方面负责人还专门向他们全面介绍了亚运会的准备情况，和严肃认真的工作态度。
    通过政治思想教育和专业知识、职业道德培训，使他们了解了从动乱到反革命暴乱的真相，认清了资产阶级自由化的思想危害，较为全面地了解体育事业的发展情况和目标任务。他们表示要为亚运会多做贡献，为实现体育强国努力奋斗。这种集中时间岗前培训取得很好的效果，体委正在认真总结经验。    （邢小泉）
