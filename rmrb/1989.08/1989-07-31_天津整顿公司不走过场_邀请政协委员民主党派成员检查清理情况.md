After more than eight months of effort, Tianjin has made initial progress in its rectification and cleanup of companies.

A total of 2,357 companies were included in Tianjin's rectification and cleanup scope. Among these, 145 companies were found to have been established by party and government agencies. Of these, 23 have been dissolved, and the remaining 122 companies have, in accordance with the requirements, basically separated financially from the party and government agencies. A total of 198 companies that do not meet the conditions for establishing a company or engage in chaotic trading in the circulation sector have been dissolved or merged.

Currently, 1,012 party and government officials in Tianjin have largely resigned from their positions in companies, including 39 leaders at the municipal department and bureau level and above. During the period of comprehensive company cleanup, Tianjin's relevant departments invited members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and various democratic parties to participate, forming a joint inspection team. They conducted key inspections on 17 major companies under the jurisdiction of the municipality, central government, and other provinces stationed in Tianjin.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the municipal government have clearly stated that those who go through the motions in the cleanup work must make up for it, those who refuse to act must be held accountable, and those who resign in name but not in fact, or companies that claim to have severed ties but have not, will be severely dealt with once discovered.

    天津整顿公司不走过场
    邀请政协委员民主党派成员检查清理情况
    新华社天津7月31日电　（记者孟子君、曹健）经过8个多月的努力，天津市清理整顿公司工作取得初步成效。
    这次被列入天津市清理整顿范围的有2357家公司，已查出党政机关开办的公司有145家，其中撤销23家，剩下的122家公司按要求在财务上基本与党政机关脱钩。对198家不具备公司条件和在流通领域里乱倒腾的公司，已分别予以撤销和合并。
    目前天津市1012名党政机关干部绝大部分已辞去在公司所兼任的职务，其中包括39名市部委办以上领导干部。前一段，在普遍清理公司的同时，天津市有关部门邀请政协委员和各民主党派成员参加，组成联合检查组，对市属、中央和外省驻津的17家大公司进行了重点检查。
    中共天津市委、市政府明确指出，对清理工作走过场的要补课，顶着不办的要追究领导的责任，对明辞暗不辞的兼职干部，明脱钩暗不脱钩的公司，一经发现，要严肃处理。
