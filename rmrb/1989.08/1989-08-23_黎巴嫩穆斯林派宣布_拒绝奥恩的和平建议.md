Lebanese Muslim factions have announced their rejection of the peace proposal put forth by Christian leader Prime Minister Oren.

The Syrian-backed Lebanese Muslim factions today rejected the peace proposal made by Christian leader Prime Minister Oren. The Sunni Muslim leader and acting Prime Minister Hus said that Oren's proposal for talks with the opposition was "a trap that will not be responded to."

The Druze Muslim leader Jumblatt stated that Oren's proposal was "a conspiracy to give Oren a breathing space."

General Oren expressed yesterday that he is willing to discuss Lebanon's future with Muslim faction leaders at any time in a round-table conference to end the 14-year-long civil war.

Hus made his remarks after a night of rocket and artillery exchanges in Beirut. The fighting between Christian forces and Syrian troops along with their supported Lebanese Muslim militias resulted in four deaths and fifty injuries overnight.

Since the outbreak of hostilities on March 8, 789 people have been killed and 2,190 injured.

    黎巴嫩穆斯林派宣布
    拒绝奥恩的和平建议
    新华社贝鲁特8月22日电  叙利亚支持的黎巴嫩穆斯林派今天拒绝了基督教派总理奥恩提出的和平建议。
    穆斯林逊尼派领导人、代总理胡斯称奥恩昨天提出同对立派和谈的建议是“一个陷阱，根本不可能得到响应”。
    德鲁兹派穆斯林领导人琼布拉特说，奥恩的建议是“一个可以让奥恩有喘息机会的阴谋”。
    奥恩将军昨天表示，他愿意在任何时候同穆斯林派领导人在圆桌会议上讨论黎巴嫩的前途问题，以结束长达14年的内战。
    胡斯的讲话是在贝鲁特又进行一夜的火箭和炮战之后发表的。当天夜里基督教军队和叙利亚军队及其支持的黎巴嫩穆斯林民兵之间的战斗又造成4人丧生、50人受伤。
    从3月8日两派战火爆发已来已有789人丧生，2190人受伤。
