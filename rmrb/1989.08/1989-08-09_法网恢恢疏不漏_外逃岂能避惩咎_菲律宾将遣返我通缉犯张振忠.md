	The Law is Far-Reaching and Leaves No Gaps; Fugitives Cannot Escape Punishment
	Philippines to Deport Chinese Fugitive Zhang Zhenzhong

	The director of the Philippine Immigration Bureau, Bienvenido Arano, announced today in Manila that the Philippine authorities have recaptured Chinese fugitive Zhang Zhenzhong, who is wanted for fraud, and will forcibly deport him back to China to face legal punishment.

	Zhang Zhenzhong was originally an employee of a company under the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Materials. He took advantage of his position to embezzle over 200 million yuan in public funds and then fled with the money. The Chinese public security authorities issued a warrant for his arrest. Zhang fled to Manila at the end of last year.

	During a press conference held in his office, Arano said that the Immigration Bureau's security intelligence personnel arrested Zhang Zhenzhong in July on charges of illegal entry and detention. However, Zhang escaped on the morning of July 23 by sawing through two iron bars on the detention center's window. On August 5, the Philippine Immigration Bureau's security intelligence personnel discovered the fugitive Zhang Zhenzhong in a house in a rice field near the province of Camarines. At that time, Zhang refused to surrender to the security personnel and threatened to commit suicide by brandishing a 12-inch knife. Later, with the assistance of the police, the Immigration Bureau's security personnel finally subdued the fugitive fraudster Zhang Zhenzhong. On the way back to Manila, Zhang attempted to bribe the escorts with 20 million pesos (approximately $48,000) to let him escape, but his attempt was rejected. Today, Zhang was brought into the press conference by the guards. He covered his face with both hands and crouched in a chair to avoid the photographers.

	During the press conference, Arano answered a question from a Xinhua News Agency reporter, saying that Zhang Zhenzhong is currently being held in the Immigration Bureau's detention center. In the spirit of cooperation among member countries of Interpol, we will forcibly deport Zhang back to China.

    法网恢恢疏不漏　外逃岂能避惩咎
    菲律宾将遣返我通缉犯张振忠
    据新华社马尼拉8月9日电　（记者翟树耀）菲律宾移民局局长比恩韦尼多·阿拉诺今天在这里宣布：菲律宾当局已再次抓获中国通缉诈骗犯张振忠，决定将他武力遣送回中国接受法律惩治。
    张振忠原为我国青海省物资局所属一公司职工。他利用工作之便诈骗公款多达200多万元人民币，然后携款潜逃。我公安部门为此对张振忠发出通缉令。张犯于去年底潜逃至马尼拉。
    阿拉诺局长在他的办公室举行的记者招待会上说，移民局安全情报人员在今年7月以非法入境罪名将张振忠逮捕并关押。不料张犯于7月23日上午用锯条锯断移民局拘留所两根铁窗栏杆，乘机逃脱。今年8月5日，菲移民局安全情报人员在马尼拉附近甲米地省一片稻田里的一座房子中发现了逃犯张振忠。当时张犯拒绝向安全人员投降，并抽出一把12英寸长的刀子威胁要自杀拒捕。后来，移民局安全人员在警察的配合下，终于擒服了诈骗潜逃犯张振忠。在押回马尼拉的路上，张还企图以200万比索（约48000美元）向押解人员行贿，央求放他逃跑，但被拒绝。张犯今天被看守人员押进记者招待会示众。他双手捂着脸蜷伏在椅子上躲避记者的拍照。
    阿拉诺局长在记者招待会上回答新华社记者问题时说，张振忠目前正在移民局拘留所看管。本着国际刑警组织成员国之间相互合作的精神，我们将把张犯武力遣送回中国。
