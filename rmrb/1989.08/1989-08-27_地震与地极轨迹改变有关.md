Soviet scientists, based on data stored in electronic computers about the movement of the North Pole over several decades and the occurrence of strong earthquakes during this period, have found a connection between dramatic changes in the polar path and earthquakes.

It is known that the Earth's axis, as it moves, "draws" a spiral, sometimes wide and sometimes narrow. Occasionally, in the spiral pattern, there are deviations that coincide with earthquakes in time. If the trajectory radius is small, no major disasters will occur. Major disasters are reflected in the large loops of the spiral. From the change in the trajectory to the earthquake, it takes ten to thirty days.

How does the newly discovered connection mechanism work? The change in the spatial position of the Earth's rotation axis causes the movement of the pole. In addition to astronomical phenomena, the rapid flow of matter within the Earth also affects the axis itself. When the axis begins to adjust slightly in the Earth's new state, stress is generated in the hard layer of the Earth's crust.

Volcanic eruptions are also related to the movement of the pole. Volcanic eruptions occur before the polar trajectory becomes chaotic. This is why the simultaneous eruptions of the Loa Great Volcano in the Hawaiian Islands and the Tolbachik Great Volcano in Kamchatka are puzzling.

Fifteen years ago, during an earthquake, volcanoes were reactivated one after another. After calculations by scientists, on the display screen, the two eruptions are lined up in a row, both concentrated in the period of dramatic changes in the North Pole trajectory.

    地震与地极轨迹改变有关
    苏联科学家根据电子计算机中储存的关于几十年来北极移动和在此期间发生强烈地震的数据研究发现，地极轨迹剧烈变迁与地震之间有联系。
    大家知道，地球顶点在移动时“画”螺旋线，时宽时窄。有时在螺旋图案中出现在时间上与地震相一致的偏斜。如果轨迹半径小，不会出现严重天灾。严重天灾表现在螺旋线的大线圈上。从轨迹改变到地震，经过十至三十天。
    新发现的联系机制如何？地球自转轴空间位置的改变引起地极移动。除天文现象外，地球内部物质的快速流动也影响地轴本身。当地轴在地球新的状态下开始微调时，地壳硬层中便产生应力。
    火山喷发也与地极移动有关，火山喷发发生在地极轨迹紊乱之前。这就是为什么夏威夷群岛洛阿大火山和堪察加托尔巴契克大火山同时喷发令人迷惑不解的原因。
    十五年前，在地震期间火山接连复活。经过科学家的计算，在显示器屏幕上，两次喷发排在一个行列里，都集中在北极轨迹剧烈变化时期。　　　　　　　　　　　　（科）
