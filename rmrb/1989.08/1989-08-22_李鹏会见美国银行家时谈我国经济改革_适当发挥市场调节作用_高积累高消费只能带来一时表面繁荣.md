Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 22nd.

Premier Li Peng today told an American banker that the goal of China's economic reforms is to overcome the past situation of overly centralized and rigid economic management, and to appropriately utilize the market's regulatory role in the economy. However, it is impossible to completely transform the socialist economy, which is based on public ownership, into a market economy. China practices an economy that combines planning with market regulation.

He explained this to Mr. Robert Abbott, Chairman and CEO of Texas Commerce Bank and ACB International Limited, during a meeting at the Zhongnanhai's Ziguang Pavilion. Li Peng said that overemphasizing a market economy in China is not feasible. Many goods in China are in short supply, and if a fully market-driven economy were implemented, it would inevitably lead to price increases and economic instability.

He said that excessively high accumulation and high consumption beyond the pace of economic development can only bring about temporary, superficial prosperity, but cannot be sustained.

When discussing China's major domestic and foreign policies, Li Peng said that China's basic assessment of the world situation has not changed. Therefore, China's independent and peaceful foreign policy and the policy of reform and opening up will not change. China is willing to develop friendly relations with the peoples and governments of all countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence.

He said that there are two types of relations between countries. One is where both sides have consistent values, beliefs, economic interests, and a desire for peace. The other is where, although ideologies and social systems differ, there are common economic interests and a desire for peace. He said that Sino-American relations fall into the latter category. The Chinese government is willing to further develop Sino-American relations.

Mr. Abbott was the first American banker to visit China after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots. Several years ago, he participated in the establishment of the first large-scale Sino-American cooperative enterprise, the Pingshuo Open-Pit Coal Mine.

He told Li Peng that he admired China's ability to solve the problem of feeding and clothing 1.1 billion people. He said that the peace and stability of the world and economic development require close cooperation between China and the United States.

He said that the American people have always harbored friendly feelings towards the Chinese people, and that this sentiment cannot be destroyed by anyone.

He expressed that his company will do everything possible to promote trade and personnel exchanges between the two countries, thereby further promoting the development of bilateral relations.

He informed Li Peng that his company is currently negotiating with relevant Chinese departments on a project to jointly produce hepatitis treatment drugs.

Li Peng said that this is a very good project. China has not yet completely overcome the prevalence of hepatitis. This project will benefit the Chinese people. The Chinese government will provide full support for this project.

Li Peng praised Mr. Abbott's investment in China as "courageous and far-sighted."

    李鹏会见美国银行家时谈我国经济改革
    适当发挥市场调节作用
    高积累高消费只能带来一时表面繁荣
    新华社北京8月22日电  （记者杨子迪）国务院总理李鹏今天对一位美国银行家说，中国经济改革的目标是克服过去经济管理过于集中、统得过死的状况，适当发挥市场调节在经济中的作用，但绝不可能把社会主义公有制为基础的经济全部转变为市场经济。中国实行的是计划经济与市场调节相结合的一种经济。
    他在中南海紫光阁会见美国德克萨斯第一城市银行公司及ACB国际有限公司董事长兼首席执行官罗伯特·阿博特先生时向他解释说，过分强调市场经济在中国是行不通的。中国许多商品短缺，如实行完全的市场经济，必然会导致物价上涨及经济不稳定。
    他说，过高的积累和超过经济发展速度的高消费只能带来一时的表面的繁荣，但不可能持久。
    在谈到中国国内外重大政策时，李鹏说，中国政府对世界局势的基本估计没有变。因此，中国独立自主的和平外交政策和改革开放政策也不会改变。中国愿意在和平共处的基础上与各国人民和政府发展友好关系。
    他说，国与国的关系有两种。一种是双方的价值观念、信仰一致，经济利益和要求和平的愿望一致。另一种是虽然意识形态和社会制度不同，但有共同的经济利益和要求和平的愿望。他说，中美关系属于后者。中国政府愿意进一步发展中美关系。
    阿博特先生是在中国平息反革命暴乱后第一位到中国来的美国银行家。数年前，他曾参与中美第一个大型合作企业平朔露天煤矿的创建工作。
    他对李鹏说，中国能够成功地解决11亿人口的吃饭穿衣问题使他深感钦佩。他说，世界的和平稳定与经济发展需要中美两国的密切合作。
    他说，美国人民对中国人民一直怀着友好的感情，这种感情是谁也破坏不了的。
    他表示，他的公司将尽一切努力促进两国的贸易和人员来往，从而进一步促进两国关系的发展。
    他告诉李鹏，他的公司目前正和中国有关部门洽谈合作生产治疗肝炎药品的项目。
    李鹏说，这是一个很好的项目。中国还没完全克服肝炎的流行。这个项目将造福于中国人民。中国政府将为这个项目提供充分的支持。
    李鹏称赞阿博特先生到中国投资是“有勇气和有远见的”。
