Recently, a fire monitoring device (see the illustration below) has been put into use in the Cevennes Mountains of France. This monitoring device is primarily composed of infrared cameras and electronic computers, installed in observation posts in the forest areas, and can operate continuously for 24 hours a day. One set of such equipment can monitor a forest area of 200 square kilometers. By using triangulation, a forest area can be divided into several observation zones, and an appropriate number of monitoring devices can be installed, putting the entire forest area under strict surveillance.

The results of using this device show that it can capture flames as small as 10 square meters, 8 kilometers away; even on foggy days, it can capture flames the size of a newspaper, 2 kilometers away. This device can also detect the heat and carbon dioxide emitted by forest fires and automatically transmit the information to the fire station via radio. Upon receiving the information, the fire station can remotely control the device to direct the camera towards the fire source and use a high-magnification zoom lens for further observation, determining the size and exact location of the forest fire, so that fire-fighting measures can be taken.

    火灾监测仪投入使用
    不久前，火灾监测仪（见下图）在法国塞文山脉投入使用。这种监测仪器主要是由红外线摄像机和电子计算机组成，安放在林区的观察哨上，1天可24小时连续工作。一套这样的装置可以监测200平方公里的森林面积之内的火情。用三角测量的方法，将一个林区划分为几个观察区，再安放相应数目的监测仪，这个林区的火情就处于严密的监视之中。
    这套仪器的使用结果表明，它能摄下8公里之外、面积约为10平方米的微弱火焰；在雾天，也能摄下2公里之外的、面积像报纸大小的火焰。这套仪器还能捕捉林火散出的热气和二氧化碳，并自动地通过无线电联系把信息传到消防站。消防站在接到信息之后，对仪器进行遥控，使摄像机对准火源，并用高倍变焦镜头，作进一步观察，确定林火的大小和准确位置，以便采取灭火行动。
