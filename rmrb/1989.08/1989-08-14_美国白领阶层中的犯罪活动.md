In recent years, the white-collar class in the United States has seen a surge in unscrupulous fraudulent activities aimed at swindling money, causing considerable headaches for relevant authorities.

Fraudulent activities within the white-collar class began to flourish towards the end of the Reagan era and are now spreading across the United States like an epidemic.

Below are some cases exposed by U.S. media.

Recently, the largest car rental and repair company in the United States, Hertz, admitted in a federal court that from 1978 to 1985, it had used methods such as overcharging, falsifying accounts, and deliberately damaging cars to claim high insurance payouts from insurance companies. The company had illegally obtained $13.7 million from overcharging customers for car repairs alone, affecting 100,000 victims. Under public pressure, the company has fired 20 employees related to the case and agreed to pay a fine of $6.9 million.

The "blood trade" scandal in New York has also attracted attention. The main culprit, Pan Si, a 39-year-old internist, along with his 68-year-old father, formed a "blood trade" group. They first bought three clinics that were manufacturing blood products for government medical research programs and then established their own blood supply network. They instructed blood collectors to draw blood from homeless, unemployed, and beggars at a low price of about $10 for every 20 bottles, then purchased it at $25 per bottle. They processed these unqualified blood products, labeled them as qualified, and sold them to hospital laboratories at a high price of $2,000 per small bottle. Since 1986, they have defrauded the government of $3.6 million.

Some individuals in the white-collar class have also resorted to stealing economic information for stock speculation. A broker named William Dillon colluded with some employees of a magazine printing plant to obtain copies of *Business Week* a day before its official release, paying $30 per issue. They then used the information from the "Wall Street Insider" column to buy the recommended stocks before the market prices rose. It is said that Dillon made at least $2,000 a week from this. He has since been fired by his boss. So far, 16 people have been arrested nationwide for engaging in such illegal activities, and at least 20 securities brokerage firms are conducting investigations.

Such cases also involve high-ranking officials. Mario Biaggi, a Democrat in his seventies who has served as a congressman for 20 years, has recently been implicated in a stock scandal. It is alleged that he committed 15 serious crimes, including using his influence to secure a federal government contract for a weapons manufacturing company in the Bronx, from which he received stocks worth $1.8 million and a $50,000 cash kickback.

Last year, a massive bribery and corruption case within the U.S. Department of Defense was exposed. This case involved not only high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense but also two prominent congressmen, with bribes and kickbacks amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. After a two-year investigation by the FBI and the Naval Investigative Service, it was revealed that these defense contractors and Department of Defense officials had colluded to use technical information for trading, ensuring that the bidding defense contractors won the contracts and then shared the profits. Since the case was exposed, at least 89 people have lost their jobs, including five high-ranking civil servants in the Department of Defense and two congressmen.

Some experts analyze that in today's United States, white-collar fraudulent activities will continue to increase. The "whoever makes money is a hero" mentality, which was revived during the Reagan era, has left a deep imprint on American society.

    美国白领阶层中的犯罪活动
    近年来，在美国白领阶层中，不择手段诈骗钱财的犯罪活动愈演愈烈，使得美国有关当局十分苦恼。
    白领阶层中的诈骗行径自里根时代后期开始盛行，目前正像流行病一样在全美蔓延。
    下面是美国报刊揭露的一些事例。
    前不久，美国最大的汽车出租和修理企业赫茨公司在联邦法庭上承认，从1978年至1985年，它在为顾客修车的过程中，以高估价、做假帐以及故意撞坏汽车向保险公司索取高额保险费等手段，大肆攫取不义之财，仅多收顾客修车费一项的非法所得就达1370万美元，受害者达10万人。在舆论压力下，该公司已解雇了与该案有关联的20名职员，并同意罚款690万美元。
    纽约的“血液交易”丑闻引人注目，主犯潘西是个39岁的内科医生，与其68岁的父亲组成一个“血液交易”集团，先买进三家为政府的医疗研究计划试制血液制品的诊所，然后建立起自己的输血网络。他们指使血液收集者以每20瓶大约10美元的低价抽取无家可归者、失业者和乞丐等穷人的血液，再以每瓶25美元的价格收购，然后将这些不合格的血液进行加工，贴上合格标签，以每小瓶2000美元的高价，倒卖给各医院的医疗实验室。自1986年以来，他们已从政府骗取了360万美元。
    白领阶层中的一些人还不择手段地窃取经济情报，进行股票投机。一个叫威廉·狄龙的经纪人，与某家杂志印刷厂的一些雇员串通一气，在杂志正式发行前一天，以每期30美元弄来《商业周刊》的复印本，然后按照其专栏“华尔街内幕”透露的信息情报，在股市价格上升前买下该杂志那个专栏所推荐的股票。据说，狄龙这么干每星期至少可以得利2000美元。而今，他已被老板炒了鱿鱼。到目前为止，全美已有16人因从事这类非法生意而被捕，至少20家经纪业证券交易所正在开展清查运动。
    这类案件还涉及到上层人士。民主党人马里奥·比尔吉年已古稀，任国会议员20年之久，最近也卷入一桩股票丑闻。据说他所犯的重罪有15条之多，其中包括利用自己的影响为一家设在布郎克斯的军火制造公司取得联邦政府的军火合同，从中索取价值180万美元的股票和5万美元的现金回扣。
    去年，美国国防部内的一桩巨大贪污受贿案败露。此案牵涉到的不仅有国防部高级官员，而且还有两名声名显赫的国会议员，贪污受贿金额高达成百亿美元。美国联邦调查局和美国海军部调查处经过长达两年的调查，查明这些军火公司和国防部的官员们内外勾结，用技术情报作交易，使投标的军火商中标获利，然后共同分赃。案发后已有至少89人丢了官，其中包括国防部的5名高级文官和两位国会议员。
    一些专家分析，在今日美国，白领阶层的诈骗活动还将进一步增加，因为里根时代重新鼓吹的“谁赚到钱谁就是英雄好汉”已给美国社会打上了深深的烙印。
