This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). Over these long years, it has generally experienced five periods: economic recovery, planned coordination, economic integration, technological development, and reform. Now, most CMEA member countries, which were devastated by war and had economies in shambles, have undergone extensive reconstruction and have all risen to the ranks of industrialized nations. The 10 member countries of the CMEA, with arable land accounting for only 16.3% of the world's total, contribute 1/4 of the world's national income, 1/3 of its industrial output, 1/5 of its agricultural output, and 1/3 of its scientific and technological strength. Therefore, even developed capitalist countries cannot ignore the fact that the CMEA is an economic entity that cannot be overlooked, and it is also a significant socialist economic force.

The Achievements of the CMEA

The CMEA's remarkable achievements include:

(1) Rapid economic development. Since its establishment, the CMEA's economic growth rate has been unparalleled by any other economic bloc. Overall, its growth rate has far surpassed that of capitalist countries. For example, from 1950 to 1983, the CMEA countries' annual growth rate of national income was 6.7%, while that of Western countries was 3.8%. Their annual growth rates of industrial output were 8.3% and 4.2%, respectively. Even excluding the high-growth periods of the 1950s and 1960s, from 1971 to 1985, the CMEA countries' annual growth rate of national income was 4.6%, while that of the EEC countries was 2.3%. Their annual growth rates of industrial output were 5.3% and 1.8%, respectively.

(2) Significant increase in strength. By the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union had already surpassed the United States in the annual production of more than 20 major products, including 19 major industrial products, such as steel, oil, coke, cement, locomotives, and tractors, and had become the world leader in these areas. Formerly agrarian member countries have also established relatively developed industrial sectors in their national economies. For example, Bulgaria has developed the electrical machinery industry, Hungary has developed the electronics industry, and Romania has developed the machine tool industry. As a whole, the CMEA's strength has become a global focus.

(3) Outstanding scientific and technological achievements. Today, the CMEA countries have a scientific and technological workforce exceeding any capitalist country or bloc, totaling over 1.42 million people, accounting for 1/3 of the world's scientific workforce. Over 40 years, they have jointly completed more than 20,000 scientific research and practical projects, developed 1,700 new types of machinery, mechanical equipment, and instruments, improved 1,300 technological processes, and produced nearly 1,400 new materials, products, and formulations. As for technological inventions, the CMEA countries register about 130,000 items annually, with 60,000 adopted, accounting for nearly 40% of the world's total technological inventions.

(4) Efforts to narrow the gap. When formulating specific policies, the CMEA usually gives more favorable treatment to relatively backward countries. For example, in terms of loans, the two major banks of the CMEA—the International Investment Bank and the International Bank for Economic Cooperation—offer loans to most member countries at an annual interest rate of 2% to 5%, while for Mongolia, Cuba, and Vietnam, the rate is only 0.5% to 2%.

Existing Problems

In the process of development, CMEA member countries have experienced both "achievements" and "joy," as well as "difficulties."

Firstly, the economic situation is severe. Before the mid-1970s, CMEA countries achieved rapid economic development mainly by increasing labor force and investment and expanding production funds. However, around the mid-1970s, these extensive factors for economic development in CMEA countries were largely exhausted. Due to poor management and financial constraints, their economies either slowed down or stagnated. For example, the average annual growth rate of national income for CMEA European member countries was 4.2% from 1976 to 1980, but it dropped to 2.7% from 1981 to 1985. Among them, Poland's national income showed negative growth for three consecutive years starting from 1979.

Another manifestation of economic difficulties is the heavy foreign debt burden faced by some member countries. In the 1970s, most CMEA countries borrowed heavily from the West to import equipment and other materials. According to statistics, by the end of 1979, the hard currency foreign debt of seven European CMEA countries was $59.4 billion. By 1988, their foreign debt had risen to $130.1 billion, with the Soviet Union owing $40.1 billion, Poland $38.7 billion, and Hungary $17 billion, among others. These high levels of foreign debt have seriously affected the internal market supply and demand balance and foreign trade of some countries.

Secondly, technological backwardness. After the war, on the one hand, due to the Cold War between the East and the West, the United States-led Western countries imposed an economic blockade on CMEA member countries. On the other hand, due to the Soviet Union's mistakes in the theory of "two worlds and two systems," CMEA countries have long been in a state of isolation or semi-isolation from the capitalist world. Under these conditions of lack of external connections and internal competition, CMEA countries found it difficult to improve the technological level of their products through internal adjustments and updates, and even more difficult to use Western advanced technology to improve their backward sectors. Therefore, the technological gap with Western countries, which had once been narrowed, has widened again.

Thirdly, the cooperation mechanism has flaws. The current cooperation mechanism of the CMEA was basically formed in the 1950s and has been continued with some modifications. Its main characteristics are rigid centralization and vertical connections, i.e., administrative management methods. Indeed, this cooperation mechanism played a positive role in the economic recovery and development of CMEA countries in the 1950s and 1960s. However, today, in the face of rapid advances in the world economy and technology, and the absence of extensive factors in socialist economic cooperation, it can no longer meet the needs of economic development and has become an obstacle to further progress.

Take the "Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technological Progress of CMEA Member Countries to the Year 2000" as an example. Its main directions are clear: five major areas—national economic informatization, automation, atomic energy technology, new materials and new processes, and biotechnology. However, the current cooperation mechanism of the CMEA is still based on administrative commands, with numerous regulations and layers of checks. This will inevitably hinder the implementation of the "Program." It is clear that fundamentally reforming the CMEA cooperation mechanism is one of the keys to revitalizing the economies of CMEA countries.

Development Prospects

The reason why CMEA member countries have been able to maintain long-term cooperation is mainly determined by their domestic economic needs. To this day, intra-CMEA trade still accounts for 60% of their total foreign trade. Most of their imported and exported goods are exchanged within the bloc, and most of their scientific and technological cooperation is conducted within the bloc. Economically, they have a high degree of complementarity. It can be said that in the long-term cooperation within the CMEA, member countries have mutually benefited and promoted each other, laying a good foundation for cooperation. However, there are still some urgent problems to be solved on the road ahead. In terms of cooperation in the fields of science and production, "it is not always easy to reach a consensus." This determines that the reform of the CMEA cooperation mechanism is inevitable, but the path is both difficult and long.

    经互会的发展及前景
    杨家荣
    今年是经互会成立40周年。在这漫长的岁月里，它大体上经历了经济恢复、计划协调、经济一体化、科技发展和改革等5个时期。如今，大多数经互会国家从战后国土满目疮痍、经济百孔千疮，经过百废俱兴，都已跻身于世界工业化国家之列。经互会10个成员国的耕地面积虽只占全世界的16.3％，但它们的国民收入却占世界的1／4，工业产值1／3，农业产值1／5，科技力量1／3。因此，即使是发达资本主义国家也不得不承认，经互会已是一个不可忽视的经济实体，它也是一支不可忽视的社会主义经济力量。
    经互会的成就
    经互会的巨大成就，主要有：
    （一）经济发展较快。从经互会成立至今，它的经济发展速度之快是任何一个其他经济集团所无可比拟的。从总体上讲，它的发展速度远远超过了资本主义国家，例如，1950——1983年，经互会国家的国民收入年增长速度为6.7％，而西方国家只有3.8％，它们工业产值的年增长速度分别为8.3％和4.2％。即使是排除经互会国家经济高速发展的50和60年代，它们在1971至1985年时期，其国民收入的年增长速度仍为4.6％，而欧共体各国在同一时期内只有2.3％，它们工业产值的年增长速度分别为5.3％和1.8％。
    （二）实力明显加强。苏联早在70年代中期，已在20多种重要产品，其中包括19种重要工业产品的年产量方面超过了美国而跃居世界首位，如钢铁、石油、焦炭、水泥、机车、拖拉机等。而从前曾是农业国的成员国，在各自的国民经济中都建立起了一些比较发达的工业部门，例如，保加利亚建立了电机工业，匈牙利建立了电子工业，罗马尼亚建立了机床制造工业。经互会作为一个整体，其实力的增长已举世瞩目。
    （三）科技成果卓著。今天，经互会国家的科技队伍已超过了任何一个资本主义国家或集团，总人数达142万多人，相当于全世界科学工作者总数的1／3。在40年中，他们共同完成了20000多个科研和实用项目，研制出了1700种新的机器、机械和仪表，改进了1300个工艺流程，制造了近1400种新材料、新产品和新制剂。至于技术发明，经互会国家每年注册的达13万项，其中被采用的有6万项，接近于世界技术发明总数的40％。
    （四）努力缩小差距。经互会在制定具体政策时，通常给予一些相对后进的国家以更优惠的待遇，如在贷款方面，经互会两大银行——国际投资银行和国际经济合作银行，对大多数成员国的贷款年利率为2％—5％，而对蒙古、古巴、越南仅有0.5％—2％。
    存在的问题
    经互会成员国在其发展的过程中，既有“成就”和“欢乐”，也遇到了“困难”。
    首先，经济形势严峻。经互会国家在70年代中期前高速发展经济，主要是靠增加劳动力和投资并扩大生产基金而取得的。然而，就在70年代中期左右，经互会国家发展经济的这种粗放因素基本用尽，且由于管理不善和资金拮据，它们的经济或转入低速发展，或陷于停滞状态。例如，经互会欧洲成员国1976——1980年国民收入的年均增长为4.2％，1981——1985年则为2.7％，其中，波兰的国民收入从1979年开始连续3年出现负增长。
    经济困难的另一表现是一些成员国外债累累，难以支付。70年代，大多数经互会国家从西方大量借贷，以引进设备和其他物资。据统计，到1979年底，经互会欧洲7国的硬通货外债是594亿美元，而到1988年，它们的外债已高达1301亿美元，其中苏联401亿美元，波兰387亿美元，匈牙利170亿美元等，上述高额外债严重地影响了一些国家内部市场的供求平衡和对外贸易。
    其次，技术相对落后。战后，一方面是由于东西方关系处于冷战状态，以美国为首的西方国家对经互会成员国进行经济封锁，另一方面是由于苏联在“两个世界市场”和“两个世界体系”理论上的失误，故长期以来，经互会国家同资本主义世界基本上处于隔绝或半隔绝状态。在这种对外缺乏联系、对内没有竞争的情况下，经互会国家既难于通过内部调节来提高产品的技术水平并对它进行更新换代，更不能用西方的先进技术改进本国的落后部门，因而，它们与西方国家本已接近或大为缩小了的技术差距再度明显拉大。
    再次，合作机制存在弊端。经互会目前的合作机制，基本上形成于50年代并在此基础上作些修补而一直延续了下来，它的主要特征是硬性集中和垂直联系，即行政管理的方法。诚然，这种合作机制在50——60年代对经互会国家的经济恢复和发展曾起过积极的作用，但今天，在世界经济和科技突飞猛进，以及社会主义国家经济合作中的粗放因素已不复存在的情况下，它已不能适应其经济发展的需要，而成了进一步飞跃的障碍。
    以《经互会成员国至2000年科技进步综合纲要》而言，其主攻方向明确，为5大领域：国民经济电子化、自动化、原子动力技术、新材料和新工艺以及生物工程，但经互会现行协作机制基本上还是行政命令的经营方式，条例繁多、关卡层层。这必然造成合作机制拖上述《纲要》实施的后腿。可见，根本改革经互会合作机制，已成为经互会国家能否振兴经济的关键之一。
    发展前景
    经互会成员国所以能坚持长期合作，主要是由它们各自国内的经济需要所决定的。至今，经互会内部贸易仍占其外贸总额的60％。它们大部分的进出口商品在内部交换，绝大部分的科技合作在内部进行，经济上具有很大的互补性。应该说，在经互会内部的长期合作中，其成员国互通有无、相互促进，现已打下了一个比较好的合作基础。但在前进的道路上尚存在一些急于解决的问题。在发展科学与生产领域之间的合作等问题上，“并非总能容易取得一致意见”。这就决定经互会国家合作体制的改革势在必行，但其路程既艰难又漫长的总趋势。
