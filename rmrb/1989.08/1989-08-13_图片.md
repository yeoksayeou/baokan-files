The weather's clear or cloudy conditions significantly affect a patient's mood. During prolonged rainy days, the gloomy weather can make sick individuals feel melancholic, delaying their recovery. Doctors at the Frankfurt University Hospital in West Germany have found that the primary cause of this phenomenon is an increase in "melatonin" within the human body. "Melatonin" is a substance that induces hibernation in animals and can make humans feel tired and lethargic. In response, the hospital designed a strong light box with an illuminance of 2000 to 3000 lux (lux is the unit of measurement for illuminance; a well-lit room typically has an illuminance of 300 lux). On dark, rainy days, doctors ask patients undergoing treatment to sit in front of the light box and gaze at the light panel for a few seconds every minute. The strong light affects the nerve cells, reducing the amount of "melatonin." After two and a half years of experimentation, the doctors reported, "The results are good."

    天气的阴晴对病人的情绪有很大影响。阴雨连绵时，天色阴暗，患病的人便会感到心情忧郁，延缓恢复健康的时间。西德法兰克福大学医院的医生发现造成这种情况的主要原因是人体内的“褪黑激素”增加。“褪黑激素”是一种促使动物冬眠的物质，它也能使人感觉疲倦而精神不振。该医院为此设计了一种强光箱，光照度达到2000至3000勒克斯（Lux，即衡量光照的单位，一般光线充足的房间的光照度为300勒克斯）。每逢昏暗的阴雨天，医生便请正在疗养的病人坐在强光箱前，每分钟注视光板数秒钟。强光对神经细胞产生作用，使
  “褪黑激素”量降低。经过两年半的实验，该院医生说“效果良好”。　（陈）
