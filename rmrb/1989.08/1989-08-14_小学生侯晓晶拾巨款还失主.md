A sixth-grade student from Nanmen Primary School in Shufang Manchu Autonomous County, Liaoning Province, Hou Xiaojing, found a large sum of money and returned it to the owner.

On the morning of July 30, Hou Xiaojing went shopping alone. Along the way, she found a cloth bag. She shouted "Whose bag is this?" several times, but no one claimed it. She took the bag home and found it contained 12,000 yuan in cash. She also found a work ID card for a technician named Wang Dezhen inside the bag. She and her father immediately contacted the county technical school and returned the money to the owner.

Wang Dezhen is the accountant of the county technical school. She lost the money on her way to the bank to deposit it. Overjoyed at the recovery of the large sum of money, she burst into tears and insisted on giving Hou Xiaojing 500 yuan as a token of gratitude, but the father and daughter politely declined.

    小学生侯晓晶拾巨款还失主
    新华社沈阳8月14日电　（通讯员王黎明）辽宁省岫岩满族自治县南门小学六年级学生侯晓晶，拾金不昧，将拾到的1.2万元巨款交还失主。
    今年7月30日上午，侯晓晶独自一人上街买菜，途中拾到一个布包。她在原地喊了几遍“是谁的包？”但无人认领。她把包带回家中，打开后见内装满满一包钱，共1.2万元。同时，又在包里发现一个写有技工学校王德珍的工作证。她和父亲立即与县技工学校联系，并将钱送到失主手中。
    王德珍是县技工学校出纳员，在去银行存款途中不慎将钱丢失。巨款失而复得，她激动得失声痛哭，并拿出500元钱硬要给侯晓晶，表达感谢之意，但被父女俩婉言谢绝了。
