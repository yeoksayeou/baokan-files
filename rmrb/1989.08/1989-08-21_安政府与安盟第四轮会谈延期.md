The Angolan government delegation returned to Luanda from Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, on August 19th, as the fourth round of talks with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) did not take place as scheduled on the 17th.

According to Angolan government officials, the UNITA delegation did not arrive in Kinshasa on the agreed date of the 17th, delaying until the 19th. This once again demonstrated their lack of seriousness. The Angolan government has proposed to the mediator, Zaire, that the fourth round of negotiations be postponed until after the meeting of eight African heads of state in Harare on the 22nd to discuss the Angolan issue.

    安政府与安盟第四轮会谈延期
    安哥拉政府代表团因与争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟（安盟）的第四轮会谈未能按期于17日举行，19日由扎伊尔首都金沙萨返回罗安达。
    据安哥拉政府人士说，安盟代表团没有在双方确定的17日与会，直拖至19日才抵达金沙萨，再次表现出不认真态度。安哥拉政府已向中间人扎伊尔方面建议第四轮谈判推至非洲8首脑22日在哈拉雷举行关于安哥拉问题的会议之后进行。
