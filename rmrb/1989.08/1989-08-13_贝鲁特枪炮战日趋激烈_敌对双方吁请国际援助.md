The gun battles between the Lebanese Christian militia and Syrian forces intensified today, with both Lebanese Christian and Muslim leaders appealing to the international community to help stop the fighting.

The fierce fighting today took place between the eastern and western districts of Beirut. Both sides used machine guns, recoilless rifles, and rocket launchers, resulting in at least 12 deaths and 48 injuries. Reports indicate that this was the most intense fighting in five months. Since the conflict began on March 8, 598 people have been killed and 1,562 injured. Most of Beirut's 1.5 million residents have fled their homes.

In light of the current situation, Lebanese Muslim Acting Prime Minister Hus issued urgent calls to the presidents of Syria, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Algeria, urging them to help stop "this mad and cruel torment of Beirut and its people."

Meanwhile, Lebanese Christian leader Oun also issued a statement, calling on the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to impose political and economic sanctions on Syria. He also hopes that the UN Security Council will convene an emergency special meeting within 24 hours to issue an immediate ceasefire appeal.

    贝鲁特枪炮战日趋激烈  敌对双方吁请国际援助
    新华社贝鲁特8月12日电  黎巴嫩基督教军队同叙利亚军队间的炮战今天仍在激烈进行，黎巴嫩基督教和穆斯林双方领导人分别呼吁国际社会帮助制止战乱。
    12日的激战在贝鲁特东、西区间进行。双方在战斗中使用了机枪、无后座力炮和火箭筒，有至少12人被打死，48人被打伤。有报道说，这次激战是5个月来最激烈的。自3月8日双方交战以来，共有598人死亡，1562人受伤。贝鲁特150万人口大部分已逃离家园。
    鉴于目前局势，黎穆斯林代总理胡斯12日分别给叙利亚总统、沙特阿拉伯国王、摩洛哥国王和阿尔及利亚总统打了紧急电话，要求他们帮助制止“这一对贝鲁特及其人民的疯狂而残忍的折磨”。
    同时，黎基督教领导人奥恩也发表声明，呼吁联合国安理会5个常任理事国对叙利亚采取政治和经济的制裁。他还希望联合国安理会在24小时内召开紧急特别会议，发出立即停火的呼吁。
