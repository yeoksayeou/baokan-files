Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 14th.

Some universities in Beijing that had their summer vacations extended due to the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot are resuming classes.

Today is the first day of classes for Renmin University of China. Early in the morning, reporters visited this key national university located in the western suburbs of Beijing. The walls of the student dormitories, which were covered with big and small posters and slogans two months ago, have been thoroughly cleaned. Banners such as "Uphold the Four Cardinal Principles" and "Persist in the Socialist Road" are prominently displayed on the teaching buildings. Over 4,600 students are attending the school-organized student situation education mobilization meeting. In the meeting venue, university students are attentively listening to the school party committee secretary Li Wenhai's mobilization speech.

Deputy Secretary of the School Party Committee Li Zhaogong told reporters that this semester, students have shown good discipline right from the start. Yesterday morning, before some departments even began their work, many students were already waiting to register. By yesterday morning, 80% of the students had registered. This morning's meeting saw the vast majority of classes arriving at the venue ahead of time, which was unprecedented in the past long period. He also told reporters that within the first 5 weeks after the resumption of classes, the school will organize students to study central documents, understand the root causes, nature, and harm of the turmoil and riot, raise their ideological awareness, and write a summary of their thoughts on this basis.

Today, Tsinghua University also began its new semester. According to a school official, after the resumption of classes, they will also organize students to study central documents, clean up their personal thoughts, and conduct make-up classes. After 5 weeks, they will conduct academic examinations and complete the thought summary. In the main building of this school, many students are seriously listening to the teacher's lecture in the classrooms. On the lawn of the campus, a few male and female university students are sitting and reading books. In the library, many students are busy returning the books they borrowed during the vacation and borrowing new ones; the reading room is also filled with many university students. The entire campus has returned to its former tranquility.

Starting from July 31st, Beijing Medical University, Beijing University of Technology, and Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics have resumed classes.

It is understood that the China University of Political Science and Law and Beijing Normal University will resume classes on August 25th. Peking University, originally scheduled to resume classes on August 29th, will postpone the resumption date to mid-October due to unforeseen circumstances.

    北京一些大学陆续开学
    普遍对学生开展形势教育
    新华社北京8月14日电（记者江钱峰）北京一些受动乱和反革命暴乱影响而提前放暑假的高等学校近日陆续开学。
    今天是中国人民大学开学的第一天。记者一早来到北京西郊的这所全国重点大学，只见两个多月前贴满大小字报、标语的学生宿舍楼的墙壁已被刷洗得干干净净。教学楼上悬挂着的“坚持四项基本原则”、“坚持走社会主义道路”等横幅格外耀眼。4600多名学生正在参加学校组织的学生形势教育动员大会。记者在会场上看到，大学生们正聚精会神地听校党委书记李文海作动员报告。
    校党委副书记李昭公告诉记者，这学期刚开学，学生们就表现出比较好的纪律性。昨天上午，有的系还未开始办公，不少学生就等着报到，昨天一上午就有80％的学生报了到。今天早上开会，绝大多数班级都提前来到会场，这在过去好长一段时间是没有过的。他还告诉记者，在开学后的5周内，学校将组织学生集中学习中央有关文件，认清动乱、暴乱的根源、性质和危害，提高思想认识，在这基础上写出思想小结。
    今天清华大学也开始新学期生活。据学校的一位干部介绍，开学后，他们也将组织学生学习中央文件，清理个人思想，同时进行补课，5周后进行学业考试，完成思想小结。在这所学校的主楼里，只见许多学生正在教室里认真地听老师讲课。在校园的草坪上，几个男女大学生正坐在上面读书。图书馆里，不少学生忙着把假期借回去的书还掉，再续借新书；阅览室里也坐着不少大学生。整个校园又恢复了昔日的平静。
    从7月31日开始，北京已有北京医科大学、北京理工大学、北京航天航空大学等学校陆续开学。
    据了解，中国政法大学、北京师范大学将在本月25日开学。原定在8月29日开学的北京大学，因故将开学日期推迟到10月中旬。
