North Korea has proposed the resumption of the 8th round of inter-Korean parliamentary talks. Our correspondent, Xu Baokang, reported from Pyongyang on August 26:

The head of the North Korean delegation to the inter-Korean parliamentary conference, Kim Jong-pil, called South Korean chief representative Choi Mun-sik on August 25, proposing to hold the 8th round of inter-Korean parliamentary talks in Panmunjom in mid-September.

According to reports, on July 11, both sides had agreed to resume the 8th round of parliamentary talks, which had been suspended. However, South Korea unilaterally announced an indefinite postponement on some pretext. To resume the parliamentary talks as soon as possible, the North proposed resuming talks in Panmunjom in mid-August, but the South has yet to respond.

    朝鲜建议恢复北南议员会晤
    本报平壤8月26日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜北南国会联席会议北方代表团团长全金哲25日打电话给南方首席代表蔡文植，建议9月中旬在板门店举行第8次北南议员代表会晤。
    据报道，7月11日北南双方曾达成协议，恢复中断了的双方国会代表第8次会晤，但南朝鲜方面却借故单方面宣布无限期延长。为早日恢复双方议员代表会晤，北方建议8月中旬重开板门店会晤，南方至今没有作出任何答复。
