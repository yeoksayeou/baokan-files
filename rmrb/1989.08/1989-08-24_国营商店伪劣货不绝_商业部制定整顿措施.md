Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 24th.

To quickly reverse the recent decline in market product quality and the persistent issue of counterfeit and substandard goods, the Ministry of Commerce has recently decided to strengthen the supervision of the quality of goods sold by state-run stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, and has proposed specific rectification measures.

In April of this year, the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the China Consumers' Association jointly conducted quality inspections on eight categories of products: bicycles, synthetic detergents, wool textiles, household voltage stabilizers, fertilizers, pesticides, dyes, aluminum pressure cookers, and rubber-soled shoes. Out of the 132 state-run commercial and supply and marketing cooperative enterprises inspected, only one had products that fully met the standards. To quickly reverse this situation, the Ministry of Commerce has decided to conduct a comprehensive rectification starting with these eight categories of products.

- Before the National Day, a thorough self-inspection and clearance of the counters and warehouses will be conducted, followed by a verification and handling process. After the verification, if any of the eight categories of goods sold by state-run stores and supply and marketing cooperatives are found to be substandard, in addition to being strictly punished according to regulations, the store managers will also be seriously dealt with.

- For any of the eight categories of goods sold by state-run stores and supply and marketing cooperatives that are found to be substandard, they must be returned, repaired, or replaced, and no excuses or delays will be tolerated.

- For any fertilizers or pesticides sold by supply and marketing cooperatives that are found to be counterfeit or substandard, the selling unit will not only refund the purchase price but also be responsible for compensating for any resulting losses.

- For new products such as household voltage stabilizers and refrigerator protectors, they must undergo quality inspections by authorized quality inspection departments and obtain a certificate of qualification before they can be sold in state-run stores and supply and marketing cooperatives.

    国营商店伪劣货不绝  商业部制定整顿措施
    本报北京8月24日讯　记者潘岗报道：为尽快扭转近来市场商品质量滑坡、伪劣假冒商品禁而不绝的情况，商业部日前决定强化对国营商店、供销社经营商品的质量监督，并提出具体的清理整顿措施。
    今年4月，商业部、国家工商局、中国消费者协会联合对自行车、合成洗衣粉、精粗毛纺织品、家用稳压器、化肥农药、染料、铝压力锅、胶面胶鞋8类商品作了质量测试。在抽检的132个国营商业、供销社商业企业中，商品质量全部达标的只有1个。为尽快扭转这种局面，商业部决定从这8类商品入手，进行全面的清理整顿。
    ——国庆节前，对柜台、仓库作一次彻底自查清理和核查处理。核查后，发现国营商店和供销社经销的这8类商品中仍有伪劣品的，除按规定严惩外，对商店负责人要严肃处理。
    ——凡国营商店、供销社出售的这8类商品，一旦发现有不合格的，要包退、包修、包换，不得以任何借口推诿和拖延。
    ——凡供销社出售的化肥、农药，再发现有假冒伪劣者，出售单位除退还购货款外，还要负责赔偿由此带来的损失。
    ——家用稳压器及冰箱保护器等新产品，今后需经过法定质量检测部门出具证明合格，才能在国营商店、供销社经销。
