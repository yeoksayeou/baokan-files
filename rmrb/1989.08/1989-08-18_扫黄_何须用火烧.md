In the current cleanup of the cultural market, many places have burned confiscated pornographic books and magazines to show "thoroughness." The reporter believes that cleaning up pornography does not mean burning books. Instead of burning these books and magazines as waste paper, it would be better to turn them into pulp for reuse.

Currently, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of illegal publications, pornographic books and magazines, as well as audio and video products, have been cleaned up across the country, which has been widely welcomed by the masses. During the cleanup, many places have piled up the confiscated pornographic books and magazines and burned them, creating a spectacular scene that reflects the local government's hatred of "pornographic harm." However, at the same time, people seem to have overlooked another problem, which is the waste of a large amount of paper.

China is currently facing a shortage of paper, with prices rising sharply. In some places, even primary school textbooks are in short supply. Therefore, burning books is not a good solution. If these books and magazines are strictly managed and recycled to make pulp for reuse, it will bring great benefits to the country.

    “扫黄”何须用火烧
    新华社记者　阎平
    在目前对文化市场的清理中，不少地方将收缴的黄色书刊付之一炬，以示“彻底”。记者认为，扫黄并非“烧黄”，与其把这些书刊当废纸烧掉，不如把它毁作纸浆重新利用。
    目前全国各地清理出几万、几十万册（件）非法出版物、淫秽书刊及录音录像制品，深得广大群众的欢迎。清理中，不少地方把收缴来的黄色书刊堆在一起一把火烧掉，场面着实壮观，体现出了当地政府对“黄祸”的憎恨。但与此同时，人们似乎忽视了另一个问题，就是大量纸张的浪费。
    我国当前纸张紧缺，价格大幅度上涨，有的地方甚至出现小学生教材赶印不出来的情况。因此，烧书并非良策。假若把这些书刊严格管理起来，并加以回收，作纸浆重新利用，将给国家带来很大好处。
