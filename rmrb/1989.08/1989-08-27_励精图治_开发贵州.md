How to view Guizhou depends on one's perspective, and opinions vary. The great Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai lamented, "The road to Yelang is ten thousand miles long, and traveling west ages a person." However, Liu Ji of the Ming Dynasty prophesied, "The thousand rivers of Jiangnan, the myriad mountains of Yunnan and Guizhou; five hundred years later, Yunnan and Guizhou will surpass Jiangnan." Today, some people still say, "The land is not flat for three miles, and people do not have three taels of silver." Yet, the old revolutionary Bo Yongbo, after visiting Guizhou, wrote a poem praising it: "If we talk about the rich resources of the world, the name 'Tianfu' should belong to this area." These views seem contradictory but actually have their own merits.

When talking about Guizhou's poverty, it refers to its history and level of development. Before liberation, under the exploitative rule of the reactionary ruling class, the people lived in misery. After the founding of New China, Guizhou underwent tremendous changes. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the situation has improved year by year. By 1988, the province's total social output value, total industrial and agricultural output value, national income, and local fiscal revenue had increased by 10.78 times, 10.62 times, 6.82 times, and 20.19 times respectively compared to 1952; and by 1.41 times, 1.37 times, 1.42 times, and 3.15 times respectively compared to 1978. With the continuous development of production, the material and cultural lives of urban and rural residents have significantly improved. Guizhou is where the Red Army fought during the Long March. Many old comrades, upon revisiting, are amazed by the tremendous changes here: the extensive network of railways, highways, waterways, and air routes makes it hard to imagine the desolate scenes of the past when the passes were like iron and birds could not fly through; the aerospace, aviation, and electronics industrial bases rising from the rugged mountains remind one of the days when people chased mountains for food and practiced slash-and-burn agriculture. The magnificent picture painted by the Party leading the people of various ethnic groups in Guizhou on this barren land showcases the great superiority of socialism. Looking back at history, Guizhou's construction achievements in the past 40 years have surpassed countless centuries; but comparing horizontally, we cannot help but feel a strong sense of crisis and urgency to catch up. The province still has a number of impoverished counties. The speed of industrial development is also below the national average. Overall, Guizhou is indeed still very poor.

When calling Guizhou rich, it refers to its potential and development prospects. This land, which is being developed, holds abundant treasures: vast mineral resources, diverse biological resources, remarkable hydropower resources, and colorful tourism resources, all of which constitute Guizhou's unique resource advantages. The province has 15 types of mineral reserves ranking in the top five nationwide. The combination of various resources is good, facilitating comprehensive benefits, and its geographical location, adjacent to Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi, and near important coastal ports, makes it entirely possible to build a southern energy base and a core area for economic exchange between the east and west. With the expansion of opening up to the outside world, Guizhou can open up to Indochina and even the entire Southeast Asia through Yunnan and Guangxi, which can be described as boundless opportunities. Guizhou's future will definitely be a prosperous future.

The task before us is: how to quickly turn potential into strength and hope into reality. Guizhou must take the path of revitalization with resource comprehensive development as the focus. In the near term, we should focus on agriculture, the foundation, and gradually improve the self-sufficiency level of grain; control population growth; strengthen ecological construction; and plan the development of leading industries, that is, focus on energy industry, raw material industry to leverage the advantages of coal, hydropower resources, and products such as phosphorus, aluminum, and ferroalloys, focus on mechanical and electronic industry to leverage the advantages of national defense science and technology industry base, and focus on light industry to leverage the advantages of cigarette and liquor industry. In this way, we can not only maintain our own development momentum but also make Guizhou a significant force in supporting the development of coastal regions and the modernization of the country.

The beloved Premier Zhou Enlai once encouraged us: "Guizhou has beautiful mountains and rivers, a pleasant climate, abundant resources, and a hardworking people. As long as the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strengthen unity and work hard, the socialist construction of Guizhou will definitely catch up and have great prospects." At this time, when we are deeply implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee and enthusiastically welcoming the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, recalling Premier Zhou's earnest expectations, we deeply feel that we have a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. Guizhou is a place where many ethnic groups reside, and getting rid of poverty is a long-term battle. This requires us to be more united and work even harder. The more than 31 million people of various ethnic groups in Guizhou will, under the Party's guidance, on the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, work together, overcome all difficulties, and press on. "A thousand-li journey begins with a single step; a slow horse can cover a thousand li if it never stops." We firmly believe that Guizhou will one day truly become "noble," rich, and leave poverty and backwardness forever in the past.

    励精图治  开发贵州
    中共贵州省委书记　刘正威　省长　王朝文
    如何认识贵州，着眼不同，看法有异。唐代的大诗人李白嗟叹：“夜郎万里道，西上令人老。”明代刘基却预言：“江南千条水，云贵万重山；五百年后看，云贵胜江南。”当今，有人尚流传：“地无三里平，人无三分银。”而老一辈无产阶级革命家董必武来贵州视察后，赋诗赞曰：“若论天下资源富，‘天府’名应属此区。”这些看法似乎截然相反，其实各有道理。
    说贵州贫困，讲的是历史和开发水平。解放前，在反动统治阶级敲骨吸髓的盘剥下，民不聊生。新中国成立后，贵州发生了巨大变化，党的十一届三中全会以来，更是年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年景不同。到1988年，全省社会总产值、工农业总产值、国民收入、地方财政收入，比1952年分别增长10.78倍、10.62倍、6.82倍、20.19倍；比1978年分别增长1.41倍、1.37倍、1.42倍、3.15倍。随着生产的持续发展，城乡人民物质文化生活有了明显改善。贵州，是红军长征奋战过的地方，许多老同志故地重游，每每惊讶于这里的巨大变化：四通八达的铁路、公路以及水道、航线，使人很难想象昔日雄关如铁、飞鸟不通的荒凉图景；丛山峻岭中兴起的航天、航空、电子工业基地，令人依稀记起当年人们赶山吃饭、刀耕火种的身影。党领导贵州各族人民在这片贫瘠的土地上所描绘的壮丽画卷，展现了社会主义的巨大优越性。竖看历史，贵州40年来的建设成就，不知超过了以往多少世纪；横向比较，我们却不能不产生强烈的危机感和奋起直追的紧迫感。全省至今还有一批贫困县。工业发展速度也在全国平均水平之下。从总体上看，贵州确实还很穷。
    称贵州富饶，指的是潜力和发展前景。这块正在开发的大地，蕴藏着丰富的宝藏：储量巨大的矿产资源，种类繁多的生物资源，令人瞩目的水能资源，绚丽多姿的旅游资源，构成了贵州独特的资源优势。全省有15种矿产储量居全国前5位。各种资源的组合态势较好，易于发挥综合效益，且地理位置紧连川、滇、湘、桂，近邻南海重要口岸，完全有可能建设成为南方的能源基地，建设成为东西部经济交汇的腹心地带。随着对外开放的拓展，贵州经云南、广西向印度支那乃至整个东南亚开放，亦可谓海阔天宽。贵州的明天，一定是富饶的明天。
    我们面临的课题是：如何尽快把潜力变成实力，把希望变成现实。贵州要走以资源综合开发为重点的振兴之路。近期，着重打好农业这个基础，逐步提高粮食自给水平；控制人口增长；加强生态建设；有计划地发展主导工业，即抓好能源工业、原材料工业以发挥煤炭、水能资源和磷、铝、铁合金等产品的优势，抓好机械电子工业以发挥国防科技工业基地的优势，抓好轻工工业以发挥卷烟工业和酿酒工业的优势。这样，我们不仅能够保持自身发展的后劲，而且可使贵州成为支撑沿海地区发展和国家现代化建设的一支重要力量。
    敬爱的周恩来总理在世时勉励我们：“贵州山川秀丽，气候宜人，资源丰富，人民勤劳。只要贵州各族人民在中国共产党领导下，加强团结，努力工作，那么，贵州的社会主义建设事业必将后来居上，大有希望。”在深入贯彻十三届四中全会精神、满怀激情迎接国庆40周年的时候，重温周总理的殷切期待，我们深感任重道远。贵州是多民族聚居的地方，摆脱贫困是一场持久的攻坚战。这就要求我们更要紧密团结，更要艰苦奋斗。贵州3100多万各族人民，将在党指引的建设有中国特色的社会主义大道上，齐心协力，万难不屈，一往无前。“骐骥一跃，不能十步；驽马十驾，功在不舍。”我们坚信，贵州总有一天会名副其实地“贵”起来，富起来，从而把贫穷落后永远留给历史。
