In Memory of Comrade Wan Xiaotang

Comrade Wan Xiaotang, the former First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, was severely persecuted by the counter-revolutionary gang of Lin Biao during the Cultural Revolution and died unjustly. It has been more than 20 years since he left us. After the overthrow of the Gang of Four, the Central Committee of the Party rehabilitated Comrade Wan Xiaotang and restored his reputation. Comrade Wan Xiaotang was an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, who dedicated his life to the Party's cause. Many old comrades who fought alongside him during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation deeply miss him. Reflecting on the tumultuous years of the past, his unwavering loyalty to the Party, courage, steadfastness, composure, and the excellent qualities of a communist—being approachable and closely connected to the masses—still deeply move us.

From 1937 to the end of 1948, Comrade Wan Xiaotang served in various positions in the Lu Xi area and the Ji Lu Yu border region, including branch secretary, platoon leader, county committee secretary, battalion political instructor, division political department deputy director, Lu Xi area party committee social department section chief, Lu Xi administrative office public security bureau director, Ji Lu Yu border area public security bureau deputy director and director, area party committee social department deputy director and director, and area party committee member. He made outstanding contributions to the establishment, consolidation, and development of the two anti-Japanese base areas. In those difficult and brutal years, he shared hardships and dangers with the people of the border region, worked tirelessly, and fought relentlessly until he was transferred to participate in the takeover of Tianjin, leaving the border region.

Comrade Wan Xiaotang, originally named Wan Xingshi, was born in 1916 in a poor peasant family in Qihe County, Shandong Province. Before the Anti-Japanese War, he studied at the Hui Min Rural Normal School and was an excellent student in both academics and conduct. At that time, influenced by the Party's opposition to civil war and call for unity against Japan, he actively organized reading groups in school, read progressive publications, and vowed to resist Japan and save the country. When the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, he took up arms and, along with a group of party members, organized anti-Japanese armed struggles in Changqing County west of Jinan. In September 1937, he joined the Communist Party of China. In mobilizing the masses for anti-Japanese armed struggles, he actively supported and endorsed the Party's united front against Japan, uniting all possible anti-Japanese forces to jointly strike against the Japanese invaders, winning the support of the broad masses, and becoming one of the earliest founders of the Tai Xi Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Forces, playing an important role in the development and growth of this guerrilla force. In the autumn of 1939, Comrade Wan Xiaotang was transferred to the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to study security work. Upon his return to Lu Xi, he devoted all his energy to the Party's security work.

At that time, the public security and protection work in the anti-Japanese base areas was in its initial stages and was in the midst of frequent battles in the enemy's rear. The work was arduous. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, Comrade Wan Xiaotang focused on three main tasks: first, establishing a public security training class, with 13 people participating in the first session, who were immediately assigned to various counties as public security bureau directors; second, establishing public security agencies throughout the area; and third, building grassroots mass public security and protection organizations in rural areas to support the development of guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear, especially in 1941 and 1942, when the Japanese invaders launched the fourth "security reinforcement campaign" in North China, strengthening the baojia system in occupied areas, forcibly conscripting labor, and eliminating so-called "unstable elements." In the border areas of the liberated areas, they strengthened fortifications and dug trenches to encircle the liberated areas with a policy of encroachment; militarily, they continuously swept through the old base areas with an "iron wall" tactic, implementing the inhumane "three-all" policy of killing, burning, and looting. In 1942, the atrocities of the Japanese invaders in North China reached their peak. At that time, Comrade Wan Xiaotang, following the instructions of the North Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that the Ji Lu Yu border area had entered an unprecedented period of hardship, requiring the entire Party and army to fully recognize the arduousness and complexity of the current struggle and quickly change the methods and organizational forms of struggle to prepare for a long and arduous struggle. In response to this dire situation, he conducted ideological education and mobilization for all public security personnel, significantly streamlined the organization, and all sections and offices of the border area public security bureau were abolished, with section chiefs becoming clerks. The streamlined personnel were assigned to the grassroots level, and the Party Committee was requested to transfer a number of experienced cadres to strengthen the public security bureau. Comrade Wan Xiaotang also pointed out that the focus of the strikes should be on Japanese spies and die-hard traitors. Public security agencies at various levels, counties, and districts formed many small armed work teams, infiltrating enemy-occupied areas to strike at Japanese and puppet spies and bandits and local tyrants who acted as their accomplices. At that time, armed groups organized by public security agencies at various levels, like countless sharp knives, infiltrated the outskirts of cities and towns in enemy-occupied areas and key transportation routes, propagandizing policies, uniting the masses, seizing dual power, eliminating die-hard traitors and spies, and working to win over and disintegrate enemy and puppet troops. This protected and consolidated the anti-Japanese political power of the border area and stabilized and boosted the confidence of the broad masses in victory.

That year, a severe drought occurred, and in some occupied areas and border areas, there were often cases of people starving to death. A large number of people fled, and the land was left uncultivated, making it very difficult to carry out work. Comrade Wan Xiaotang was very concerned about the people's hardships and sent office workers and the security detachment of the administrative office to the severely affected areas around Neihuang to fight, open up wasteland, and provide relief. At that time, there were no food reserves, and only a small amount of food could be saved from the meager rations of the office workers to provide relief to the people. This was truly a drop in the bucket! Moreover, the office workers sometimes had to fill their stomachs with bran, tree leaves, and sweet potato vines, and at the same time, they had to sow some seeds on the uncultivated land so that the fleeing people could have some harvest to fill their stomachs when they returned home. In this way, sharing hardships and dangers, and living and dying together, further united the broad masses of the people to jointly resist the enemy.

In 1943, with the development of the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese imperialists, exhausted by their war of aggression against China, vigorously cultivated the Wang Jingwei puppet regime, attempting to change forms to deceive and rule the Chinese people. At that time, Comrade Wan Xiaotang, following the Party's instructions, organized the public security system to launch a political offensive among the broad masses of the people to oppose, strike, and isolate the Wang Jingwei puppet traitor regime, further overcome difficulties, consolidate and expand the liberated areas, strengthen the people's political power, prepare for the counterattack, and strive for victory in the Anti-Japanese War. This public security force, after several years of arduous struggle, had an increasingly perfect organization and growing combat power. It established close ties with the broad masses of the people, resolutely performed the functions of the public security agencies, serving as both the public security agencies of the anti-Japanese democratic government and the investigative and prosecutorial agencies of the state. This loyal, brave, mobile, and combat-ready public security force demonstrated its power in the struggle to strike the enemy, protect the people, and the anti-Japanese democratic government, and its influence grew day by day.

After Japan's surrender, the reactionary forces within the Kuomintang attempted to seize the fruits of the eight-year anti-Japanese war in the enemy's rear and merge with the puppet and reactionary forces to openly and secretly sabotage the liberated areas. Especially after June 1946, the Kuomintang tore up the Sino-Soviet ceasefire agreement and attacked our Central Plains liberated area. At this time, the Ji Lu Yu border area, like other liberated areas, faced a serious situation where the remaining Japanese and puppet forces, reactionary forces within the Kuomintang, landlords, homecoming teams, bandits, and local tyrants combined into a counter-revolutionary tide, launching a full-scale attack on our liberated areas. Comrade Wan Xiaotang called on all public security personnel to prepare for battle, strengthen anti-spy and anti-sabotage work, strengthen investigation and case-solving within the liberated areas, severely crack down on enemy spies and reactionary forces infiltrating our liberated areas, and universally rectified and strengthened public security agencies and grassroots security organizations at all levels, greatly enhancing mass public security and anti-espionage work. Before the outbreak of the full-scale civil war, a batch of hidden dangers were eliminated to prepare for the war, and efforts were made to win over those who could be won over from the enemy's ranks to actively redeem their sins. At the same time, public security personnel participated in the mass anti-traitor and anti-bully complaint movements. During this period, a large number of counter-revolutionary cases were solved, directly protecting and consolidating the liberated areas. Public security armed work teams operating on the outer lines persisted in guerrilla warfare for a long time. In 1947, they were commended by the Central Bureau's Social Affairs Department. In the first half of 1948, during the War of Liberation, they actively participated in battles with the main forces, launching more than 3,000 offensive battles and achieving brilliant results.

To support the operations of our field armies and the anti-espionage struggle in the interior, and to ultimately seize the cities, Comrade Wan Xiaotang, following the Central Committee's instructions to strengthen urban work, established urban work agencies around the Ji Lu Yu border area along the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan railways, targeting the enemy-occupied cities of Jinan, Jining, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Anyang, and others. According to the decision of the area Party Committee, the City Work Department and the Military Region Intelligence Office were merged into the Social Affairs Department, unifying the leadership of external work, extensively developing friendship work, and planning for the long term. Through the efforts of our urban underground comrades, significant achievements were made, playing an invaluable role in our army's organizational offensive battles and the capture of cities. In supporting the anti-espionage struggle in the interior, they obtained materials on enemy spy organizations and the activities of spies infiltrating our liberated areas, providing reliable bases for our interior to solve cases and strike the enemy. At that time, comrades working in urban areas also took advantage of various opportunities to develop party organizations, do united front work among people from all walks of life, and protect important units such as factories, offices, and schools to prevent them from being sabotaged by the enemy when the cities were liberated. They also did a lot of preparatory work for eliminating the remaining enemy after the cities were recovered.

Comrade Wan Xiaotang paid great attention to the logistical support work for the main forces. During the War of Liberation, the public security system dispatched a large number of workers to participate in and protect various levels of logistical support work. They braved gunfire and rain, endured heat and cold, and organized mass support work day and night. Many comrades also accompanied the army on long marches, contributing to the rescue of wounded soldiers and the transportation of supplies. Comrade Wan Xiaotang personally led the re-education of prisoners of war. At that time, a large number of key figures from the Kuomintang's party, government, military, and special services were detained. Political and ideological education classes were held for them, implementing a lenient policy of treating prisoners of war well. After education, those who wished to stay were allowed to, and the rest were released. After returning, they propagated our party's policies, exposed the Kuomintang's deceptive propaganda, and played an active role in our army's advance. Some made contributions in organizing uprisings and laying down their arms. Comrade Wan Xiaotang once personally led cadres to inspect and guide work in various counties south of the Yellow River, where battles were frequent, greatly encouraging the broad cadres and masses.

Comrade Wan Xiaotang was a loyal and upright member of the Communist Party who dedicated his life to the Party's cause. He was good at uniting comrades and, for those who made mistakes, always started from education, insisted on principles, and hoped they could improve their awareness and correct their mistakes. He was frugal, approachable, and did not put on airs. Whether dealing with superiors, peers, or subordinates, he always treated them sincerely and never engaged in disputes without principles. Peers saw him as a frank friend, subordinates saw him as a trusted leader, and some young people saw him as a respected elder. He insisted on the good style of Party Committee leadership, the mass line, and seeking truth from facts. During the rectification of the Pingyuan Branch Party School in 1944, Comrade Wan Xiaotang served as the secretary of a large team. Most of the students were county and district leaders. At that time, some places conducted party rectification, and due to the influence of "leftist" errors, they carried out things like "three investigations and three rectifications," harming many comrades. However, in Wan Xiaotang's team, the Party's policies were correctly implemented, and the method of treating diseases and saving people with gentle winds and fine rains was used to educate and help comrades. For those with political and historical problems, no action was taken before obtaining conclusive evidence. After clarifying the facts and conditions were ripe, action was taken. An old comrade recalled that at that time, due to historical problems, he was misunderstood by others and harbored doubts. Soon, Comrade Wan Xiaotang told him, "Rectification is to draw a clear line between enemies and us, and the method is gentle winds and fine rains. You have no problems and do not need to be doubtful and anxious," which made him put down his burden and feel that Comrade Wan Xiaotang was truly "seeking truth from facts" and acting according to the Party's policies. This team's rectification lasted for a year without any false cases, and the political and ideological level was significantly improved, strengthening the Party's unity. In 1947, during the Ji Lu Yu area Party rectification, a deputy director of the area Party Committee's Social Affairs Department was once wrongly rectified, and someone proposed expelling him from the Party. Comrade Wan Xiaotang insisted on being cautious and, after extensive investigation and research, clarified the situation and timely spoke up for the deputy director, which was rare at that time when the "leftist" trend was strong. In handling cases, he always based himself on facts, carefully analyzed the evidence, and finally made decisions. He firmly rejected materials obtained from capturing wind and forcing confessions, avoiding false, wrong, and mistaken cases. In leading public security and protection work, Comrade Wan Xiaotang firmly placed public security and protection agencies under the unified leadership of the Party, consistently opposed specialization, secrecy, and isolationism that deviated from the Party's leadership, and firmly implemented the Party's public security and protection work policy of combining specialized work with the mass line, thus ensuring the smooth development of public security work and continuously cultivating and improving the political and ideological level and policy level of the cadre team.

In December 1948, Comrade Wan Xiaotang, with a sense of victory, was ordered to participate in the takeover of the big city of Tianjin. Over the next 17 years, he made immortal contributions to the takeover, public security, reform, and construction of Tianjin. In the gloomy days of 1966, the exhausted Wan Xiaotang suddenly passed away on September 19. Comrade Wan Xiaotang left us too early, which is deeply regrettable. Comrade Wan Xiaotang's excellent qualities, his lifelong dedication to the revolutionary cause, and his brilliant achievements for the Party and the people will forever be our learning example and be engraved in people's hearts.

    怀念万晓塘同志
    段君毅　王笑一　王路宾
    原中共天津市委第一书记万晓塘同志“文革”中倍受林彪反革命集团的迫害，竟含冤而逝，现已离开我们20多年了。粉碎“四人帮”后，党中央为万晓塘同志平反昭雪，恢复了名誉，万晓塘同志是中国共产党的优秀党员，为党的事业忠心耿耿战斗了一生，许多在抗日战争和解放战争时期和他在一起共同战斗过的老同志，无不深切怀念。回忆往昔峥嵘岁月，他对党无限忠诚，在革命斗争中他那勇敢、刚毅、坚定、沉着，平易近人，密切联系群众的共产党人的优秀品质至今仍使我们感受尤深。
    晓塘同志从1937年至1948年底，在山东鲁西区和冀鲁豫边区抗日根据地，历任支部书记、中队长、县委书记、营教导员、团政治处副主任、鲁西区党委社会部科长、鲁西行署公安局局长、冀鲁豫边区公安局副局长、局长、区党委社会部副部长、部长、区党委委员等职，他为鲁西区、冀鲁豫边区两抗日根据地的创建、巩固与发展，做出了出色的贡献。在那些艰难、残酷的岁月里，他与边区人民共患难，同生死，呕心沥血，战斗不息，直到调他参加接收天津工作离开边区。
    晓塘同志原名万兴诗，1916年生于山东省齐河县的一个贫农家庭，抗日战争前在惠民乡村师范读书，是个品学兼优的学生。当时受到党的反对内战、团结抗日的革命影响，在学校积极组织读书会，阅读进步书刊，立志抗日救国，“七·七”抗日烽火燃起投笔从戎，并和一批党员在济南以西的长清县组织开展抗日武装斗争。1937年9月加入中国共产党，在发动群众抗日武装斗争中，积极支持和拥护党的抗日民族统一战线，团结一切可以团结的抗日力量，共同打击日本侵略者，取得了广大群众的拥护，成为太西抗日游击队最早的创建人之一，对这支游击队的发展壮大起了重要作用。1939年秋，晓塘同志调中共中央山东分局学习保卫工作，回到鲁西，就把全部身心贡献给党的保卫工作事业。
    当时抗日根据地公安保卫工作是初创阶段，处在频繁战斗的敌后，工作是艰巨的。晓塘同志在党委领导下，突出抓了三件事：一是创办公安培训班，第一期13人参加，当即分配到各县任公安局长；二是建立全区的公安机构；三是建设农村基层群众性的公安保卫组织以配合敌后游击战争的开展，特别是1941和1942年，日本侵略军在华北推行第四次“治安强化运动”，在敌占区强化保甲，大肆抓丁，肃清所谓“不稳分子”，在解放区的边沿地带，强修碉堡，大挖封锁沟，对解放区进行蚕食政策；军事上对老根据地连续扫荡，以“铁壁合围”的战术，实行灭绝人寰的杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光政策”。1942年日寇在华北敌后的侵略暴行，达到了极点，当时晓塘同志根据中共中央北方局的指示，指出冀鲁豫边区进入了空前艰苦时期，要求全党全军充分认识当前斗争的艰苦性、复杂性，必须迅速改变斗争方式与组织形式，作长期艰苦的斗争准备，针对这种险恶形势，对全体公安人员进行思想教育和动员，从组织上大量精简机构，边区公安局所有科、室一律取消，科长变为干事，精简下来的人员充实基层，并请求党委调了一部分有斗争经验的干部加强公安局。晓塘同志同时指出打击的重点是日本特务和死心塌地的汉奸，各专区、县、区公安机关人员组成许多小型武工队，深入敌占区，打击那些日伪特务及为虎作伥的土匪、恶霸。当时各级公安机关组织的武装小组，像无数把尖刀一样，深入敌占区城镇周围和交通要道，宣传政策，团结群众，掌握两面政权，消灭死心塌地的汉奸特务，争取与瓦解敌伪军工作，从而保卫和巩固了边区抗日政权，稳定和鼓舞了广大群众的胜利信心。
    这一年，发生了严重的旱灾，在一些敌占区和边沿区常有饿死人的情况，人口大量外逃，土地无人耕种，开展工作十分艰苦，晓塘同志非常关心人民的饥苦，并派出机关工作人员和行署警卫部队去内黄一带严重灾区，一面战斗，一面开荒，一面救灾。当时没有什么粮食储备，只能从机关工作人员勉强糊口的口粮中节约出一点粮食救济群众，那真是杯水车薪！何况机关工作人员有时还以米糠、树叶、红薯梗等来充饥，同时还要给无人耕种的土地撒上一些种子，以备逃荒的群众回乡时能有点收获来充饥，这样患难同济，生死与共，进一步团结了广大人民群众，共同对敌。
    1943年，随着抗日战争形势的发展，日本帝国主义者的侵华战争已精疲力尽，于是大力培植汪伪政权，妄图改变形式，来欺骗和统治中国人民。当时晓塘同志，根据党的指示，组织公安系统在广大人民群众中开展反对、打击和孤立汪伪汉奸政权的政治攻势，进一步克服困难，巩固扩大解放区，加强人民政权，准备反攻，争取抗日战争的胜利。这支公安队伍经过几年艰苦斗争的锻炼，组织日臻完善，战斗力日益坚强，同广大人民群众建立了紧密的联系，坚决履行了公安机关的职能，它既是抗日民主政权的治安机关，又是国家的侦察和检察机关。这支忠贞、勇敢、机动、善战的公安队伍，在胜利地打击敌人，保卫人民和抗日民主政权的斗争中，日益显示其威力。
    日降后，国民党中的反动势力企图夺取敌后八年抗战的胜利果实，同伪顽反动势力合流，对解放区进行公开和秘密的疯狂的破坏。特别是1946年6月以后，国民党撕毁了国共停战协定，进攻我中原解放区。此时冀鲁豫边区和其他解放区一样，在解放区内外的日、伪残余，国民党中的反动势力以及地主、还乡团、土匪、恶霸等结合成一股反革命逆流，向我解放区全面扑来，形势非常严重。晓塘同志号召全体公安人员作好战斗准备，加强除奸、防奸工作，在解放区内部加强侦察破案，严厉打击潜入我解放区的敌特和反动势力的潜伏破坏活动，普遍整顿健全了各级公安机关和基层保卫组织，大大强化了群众性的治安、防谍工作。在全面内战爆发之前，为巩固后方清除了一批隐患，做好了战争准备，对敌人内部争取那些可以争取的日伪人员去主动立功赎罪，同时公安人员参加群众性的反奸、反霸诉苦运动。这一时期破获了大量反革命案件，直接保卫和巩固了解放区，在外线活动的公安武工队，长期坚持敌后武装战斗，1947年曾受到中央局社会部的表扬。1948年上半年，在解放战争中配合主力部队作战，主动出击战斗达3000多次，取得了辉煌的战绩。
    为配合我野战军作战和内地反特斗争，最后夺取城市，晓塘同志依照中央加强城市工作的指示，在冀鲁豫边区周围，沿津浦、陇海、平汉三线，对敌占城市济南、济宁、徐州、开封、新乡、安阳等城市建立了城市工作机构，并根据区党委的决定将城工部、军区情报处合并到社会部，统一对外工作的领导，广泛开展交朋友工作，长期打算，发展力量。经过我城市地下工作同志们的努力，取得了很大成绩，对我军组织战役进攻和攻取城市起了不可估量的作用。在配合内地反特斗争方面，掌握了敌特组织和潜入我解放区的特务活动材料，为我内地侦破案件、打击敌人提供了可靠的根据。这时在城市工作的同志还利用各种时机发展党组织，在各界人士中做团结工作，对工厂、机关、学校等重要单位进行了保护，防止解放城市时遭受敌人破坏，还对城市收复后肃清残敌方面做了大量准备工作。
    晓塘同志十分重视配合主力部队作战的战勤工作，在解放战争期间，公安系统抽调了大量工作人员参加和保卫各级战勤工，冒枪林弹雨，忍酷暑严寒，日以继夜地组织群众性的支前工作。其中很多同志并随军远征，在抢救伤员、运送粮食等方面做出了贡献。晓塘同志直接领导了战俘的集训工作，当时收容了大量国民党的党、政、军、特等骨干分子，对他们开办训练班，进行政治思想教育，实行优待俘虏的宽大政策，经过教育后，除愿留下工作的以外，均被放回。他们回去后宣传我党政策，揭穿国民党欺骗宣传，对我军的进军都起了积极作用，有的在发动起义、放下武器中作出了贡献，晓塘同志曾亲率干部深入黄河以南战斗频繁的各县检查指导工作，对广大干部和人民群众给予很大的鼓舞。
    晓塘同志是一个对党的事业忠心耿耿、品德高尚的共产党员，善于团结同志，对犯有错误的同志，都是从教育出发，坚持原则，期望其能提高认识改正错误。他艰苦朴素，平易近人，不摆架子，不论上级、同级或下级都能以诚相待，从不闹无原则纠纷，同级干部把他看作是诤友，下级干部把他看成是知己、好领导，有的青年把他看成是敬爱的长者。他坚持党委领导、群众路线、实事求是的好作风。1944年平原分局党校整风时，晓塘同志任一个大队的支部书记，学员绝大多数是地、县领导干部。当时有些地方整党，由于“左”的错误影响，搞什么“三查三整”等，伤害了不少同志，而晓塘这个支部，正确执行党的政策，坚持以和风细雨治病救人的方法教育帮助同志，有政治历史问题的在未取得确凿证据以前，不作处理，待以后弄清事实条件成熟，再作处理。有位老同志回忆自己当时因历史问题被人误解，心存疑虑，不久晓塘同志告诉他：“整风是划清敌我界限，方法是和风细雨，你没有问题，不必疑虑不安”，使他放下了包袱，感到晓塘同志真是“实事求是”、按党的政策办事。这个支部整风一年，没有发生冤案，政治思想水平有了很大提高，增强了党的团结。1947年冀鲁豫区党委整党，区党委社会部有位副部长，一度被错整，并有人提出要开除党籍，晓塘同志坚持慎重从事，经多方调查研究，弄清情况后，及时站出来为这位副部长讲公道话，这在当时“左”的风头上是难能可贵的。他在审批案件中都是立足于事实，认真分析罪证，最后作出决定，对那些捕风捉影和逼供信得来的材料，他是坚决顶回去，避免了冤、假、错案发生。晓塘同志在主持公安保卫工作中，坚决将公安保卫机关置于党的统一领导之下，一贯反对特殊化、神秘化和孤立主义等脱离党的领导的倾向，坚决执行党的公安保卫工作提出的专门工作与群众路线相结合的指导方针，因而保证了公安工作的顺利开展，不断培养和提高了干部队伍的政治思想和政策水平。
    1948年12月，晓塘同志带着胜利的喜悦，奉命参与接管天津大城市工作，17年来为天津接管、治安、改造、建设均作出了不朽的贡献。在1966年满布阴霾的日子里，心力憔悴的万晓塘同志，于9月19日竟猝然长逝。晓塘同志离开我们太早了，使人万分惋惜，晓塘同志的优秀品质、毕生为革命事业的献身精神以及他对党和人民做出的光辉业绩，将永远是我们学习的榜样，铭记在人们的心中。
