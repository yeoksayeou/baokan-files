The Merger and Acquisition Craze Sweeping Across Western Europe

By People's Daily reporter Wēi Wěi

Currently, in Western European countries, mergers and acquisitions occur almost every week. Each merger or acquisition is touted as a proactive step towards the 1992 Single Market.

This trend of mergers and acquisitions has rapidly developed in recent years. In 1983, among the top 1000 companies in Western Europe, only 117 mergers or acquisitions took place. By 1986, this number had nearly doubled to 227. In 1987, it surged to 303, showing signs of sweeping across Western Europe. The momentum this year is even stronger, with mergers and acquisitions rising almost every month. In just the first half of the year, there have been 587 cases, involving a total of 15 billion European Currency Units. It is anticipated that as the 1992 Single Market approaches, this trend will continue to intensify.

In previous years, mergers and acquisitions primarily occurred within the banking and insurance sectors. However, this year has seen a new development: among the nearly 600 mergers and acquisitions in the first half of the year, 62 involved the banking and insurance industries, making them the most frequent, but the total value was only 2.7 billion European Currency Units, placing them second in terms of financial involvement. In contrast, the food industry saw 53 mergers and acquisitions, attracting a total of 3.6 billion European Currency Units, making it the leader for the first time. This shift indicates that the trend of mergers and acquisitions is not only accelerating but also expanding into more diverse sectors.

Western European companies are so enthusiastic about mergers and acquisitions because they aim to transcend national borders and enhance their competitiveness in the international market. Whether through mergers or acquisitions, the goal is to increase the market share of the company or the newly formed corporate group. For companies, there are three main benefits: first, increased sales volume, which is more cost-effective than reducing prices or using advertising to gain market share; second, reduced production costs as output increases; and third, the ability to concentrate more human, material, and financial resources on research and development. With these advantages, it is no wonder that large Western European companies are eager to pursue mergers and acquisitions. They view identifying potential merger or acquisition targets as a major strategic decision, thereby creating an unstoppable trend that is sweeping across Western Europe.

However, what kind of trend is this for the realization of the 1992 European Single Market? Is it beneficial or harmful to the free competition that Western economies rely on? The answers from the business and political sectors differ. At least, the European Commission has reservations and concerns, believing that if not properly managed, it could harm the Single Market and free competition. Their arguments are roughly as follows: first, the prevalence of mergers and acquisitions could lead to a single company or corporate group controlling production, distribution, and sales, forming a monopoly, which is often inconsistent with increased productivity; second, it could create a seller's market, increasing the risk of harming consumer interests; third, some countries might strengthen state intervention to protect their domestic companies, which is obviously detrimental to the construction of an internal unified market.

Therefore, the European Commission advocates for stricter regulation of mergers and acquisitions that could lead to market dominance, preventing them from obstructing the implementation of competition laws. In March, the European Commission condemned 23 chemical companies from 12 member states for dividing the market and imposed a $60 million fine. In April, it investigated seven companies from Belgium, West Germany, the Netherlands, France, and the UK, warning them not to collude to form a European soda ash cartel. In May, some cement factories were fined. In June, it accused companies in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg of controlling the ground coffee market. According to statistics, the European Commission reviews approximately 80 cases of economic activities violating competition laws each year. At the same time, it advocates that any merger or acquisition involving 2 billion European Currency Units or more should fall under its jurisdiction.

Unfortunately, the European Commission's repeated condemnations and penalties have had little effect. While their intentions to control mergers and acquisitions to protect internal production and trade are good, they remain largely theoretical. The main reason is that the construction of the Single Market itself objectively encourages corporate mergers and acquisitions. Under the guise of the Single Market, large companies inevitably pursue a strategy of market domination. Capitalists seek profit, and if there is profit to be made, why not?

Of the 587 mergers and acquisitions in the first half of this year, 73% involved companies from the European Community and the European Free Trade Association. The remaining 23% involved American and Japanese companies. The latter two are concerned that after the realization of the European Single Market, trade barriers will be raised, and Europeans might use "anti-dumping," "reciprocity," and import quotas to prevent their products from entering the European market. Therefore, they are taking preventive measures by entering the market first. In this sense, the current trend of mergers and acquisitions in Europe is also a reflection of the intensifying international competition. The European Commission's attempts to limit this trend are futile and difficult to achieve.

### 风靡西欧的企业兼并与联合

    风靡西欧的企业兼并与联合
    本报记者　魏崴
    目前在西欧国家里，每一周都发生企业兼并或联合之类的事。每一次兼并或者联合，又都说成是为1992年大市场作积极准备的。
    这股兼并或联合之风，是近年来迅速发展起来的。1983年，西欧最大的1000家公司中，实施兼并或联合的仅为117起。1986年已达227起，比1983年几乎翻了一番。1987年激增至303起，已大有席卷西欧之势。今年的来势更猛，几乎是逐月上升，半年的时间内已达587起，涉及金额共150亿欧洲货币单位。人们预料，随着1992年大市场日益临近，此风还会愈演愈烈。
    往年，企业兼并或联合主要发生在银行业和保险业内。今年却有一个新变化：在1—6月近600起兼并或联合中，属银行业、保险业者共62起，在次数上虽居各业之冠，但涉及金额仅为27亿欧洲货币单位，已退居第二。而食品工业内的兼并或联合（共53起）却吸引了总额为36亿欧洲货币单位的资金，首次领了“风骚”。这一动向说明，兼并、联合之风不但发展迅猛，且触及的领域日益广泛。
    西欧企业如此热衷于兼并或联合，无非是试图超越国界，提高本身在国际竞争中的能力。兼并也好，联合也好，所追求的都是想扩大自己企业或新形成的企业集团在市场上所占的比重。对企业来说，其具体好处有3个：首先，销售量增大了，这比通过压低售价或运用广告去抢对手的地盘要经济得多；其次，成本价格将随着产量加大而降低；最后，可以集中更多的人力、物力和财力去从事科研和发展。有这些好处，西欧大企业当然乐此不疲。它们纷纷把物色兼并或联合的对象作为重大的战略选择，于是便形成了势不可当、风靡西欧的这股风潮。
    然而，对实现1992年的欧洲大市场而言，这究竟是股什么样的风呢？对西方经济所赖以生存的所谓自由竞争来说，到底是有利还是有害？企业界和政界的答案不甚相同。至少，欧洲共同体委员会就存有疑虑和戒心，认为弄得不好，将会损害大市场和自由竞争。其论据大抵如下：一、兼并或联合盛行，会导致某一企业或某企业集团控制生产、流通、销售等各个环节，形成垄断。这往往同提高生产率不相一致；二、会形成卖方市场，损害消费者的利益的危险增加了；三、一些国家为保护本国企业计，可能强化国家干预，而这对于内部统一大市场的建设显然不利。
    因此，欧共体委员会主张，在推进大市场建设的同时，对一些大企业的沆瀣一气、企图垄断市场的做法加以制裁和打击，对有可能支配市场的集中现象予以适当控制，防止它们阻碍竞争法规的执行。今年3月间，欧共体曾谴责12个成员国的23家化工企业联合瓜分市场的行为，并课以6000万美元的罚款。4月间，它对比利时、西德、荷兰、法国、英国的7家公司进行调查，警告它们不得串通起来组织欧洲烧碱卡特尔。5月，一些水泥厂被罚。6月里，它又指责荷、比、卢的碎咖啡市场成了某几家公司的一统天下。据统计，对此类违反竞争法规的经济活动，欧共体委员会每年立案审查的约达80起。同时，它还主张，凡涉及20亿欧洲货币单位以上的兼并或联合，均应在其管辖之列。
    可惜，欧共体委员会的屡屡谴责和制裁，至今收效甚微，控制兼并或联合以保护内部生产和贸易的用心虽好，但亦尚属纸上谈兵。原因主要是大市场组建的本身，客观上是鼓励企业的兼并和联合的。假大市场之名，行垄断市场之实，是诸大企业必然奉行的战略。资本家要赚钱，既有利可图，何乐而不为？
    参与今年1—6月587起兼并或联合者，属欧共体和欧洲自由贸易联盟的，占73％。其余23％，是美国和日本的企业。后两者担心欧洲大市场实现后，贸易壁垒会抬高，欧洲人可能用“反倾销”、“互惠”及进口配额等办法阻止它们的产品进入欧洲市场，故防患于未然，先打进来再说。就这个意义而论，当前欧洲这股兼并联合之风，又是国际竞争日趋激烈的必然反映。欧共体委员会想加以限制，更是鞭长莫及，谈何容易。
