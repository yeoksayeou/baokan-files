    联合国官员呼吁以无条件释放人质
    阿迈勒领导人说人质问题不易解决
    新华社大马士革8月6日电　联合国副秘书长马拉克·戈尔丁今天在这里呼吁以色列当局立即无条件地释放被以色列突击队7月28日绑架的黎巴嫩真主党领导人奥贝德和他的两名助手。
    戈尔丁是在与叙利亚外长法鲁克·沙雷举行会谈时发出这一呼吁的。
    据叙通社报道，与会双方就戈尔丁为调查美国人质希金斯中校的命运所作出的努力进行了讨论。他们还讨论了在黎巴嫩的其他西方人质问题以及彻底解决人质问题的可能性。
    新华社伦敦8月6日电黎巴嫩什叶派阿迈勒民兵组织领导人贝里6日说，人质问题不可能马上得到解决。
    他是在大马士革同联合国特使古尔丁会晤后对英国广播公司说这番话的。
    对于希金斯的死，贝里认为这是以色列绑架黎巴嫩真主党领导人奥贝德引起的。
