    Alarm Raised Over Pig Production

    After the significant decline in pig production in 1987, this year's rural pig production is again sounding the alarm. According to an investigation into the pig production situation in our city: first, there is a serious issue of selling and slaughtering sows, leading to a shortage of piglets. Statistics show that by March, the number of sows and piglets in stock had decreased by 22% compared to the beginning of the year, with many sows being sold or slaughtered. Many high-quality pig farms have delayed or stopped breeding pigs. Second, pork prices have plummeted, leading to early slaughter of fattened pigs. Based on spot checks at several pig markets, many pigs have been slaughtered early, and the purchase price for pigs has dropped to 2.6 yuan per kilogram. All these signs indicate that pig production is starting to decline sharply.

    生猪生产响起警报
    1987年生猪生产大滑坡后，今年农村生猪生产又响起警报。据对我市生猪生产情况的调查：一是母猪出售、宰杀严重，仔猪货源不足。据统计，截至3月，母猪和仔猪存栏数比年初下降22％，出现了纷纷出售和宰杀母猪的现象。许多良种猪场已推迟或停止猪源配种。二是猪肉价格猛跌，肥猪提前出栏。根据对几个生猪市场抽查，许多生猪都已提前出栏，生猪收购价已降至每公斤2.6元。种种迹象表明，生猪生产已开始大滑坡。
