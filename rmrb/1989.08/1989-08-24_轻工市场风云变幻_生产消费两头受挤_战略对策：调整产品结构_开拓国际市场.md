Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 24th.

Light industry enterprises, which are responsible for 70% of consumer goods production, unexpectedly encountered a large-scale stagnation in light industrial products in the second half of this year, with the market rapidly weakening.

Authoritative sources from the Ministry of Light Industry revealed that the light industry market is experiencing turbulent changes, with both production and consumption under pressure. It is understood that compared to the same period last year, sugar, salt, synthetic detergents, matches, soap, paper, canned goods, refrigerators, washing machines, and electric fans saw increases ranging from 3.6% to 34.5% in the first half of this year. However, the sales volume of these major light industrial products showed a noticeable downward trend.

Yesterday's popular items have become yesterday's news. Refrigerators, which were once hot sellers, now have to be sold at reduced prices. Even essential daily necessities like sugar, matches, soap, and salt, which are still rationed in some regions, are seeing declining sales, with some products dropping by as much as 28%. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce, out of 36 types of goods, only 4 saw increased sales compared to last year, with the rest showing declines. Most of these goods are light industrial products. Commercial inventories are increasing, and enterprise inventories are also on the rise.

Officials from the Ministry of Light Industry analyzed that the rapid changes in the light industry market are mainly due to four factors: First, the central government's rectification and adjustment measures have shown initial results, with price increases slowing down, and the public's fear of price hikes easing, shifting from panic buying to holding onto their money; Second, the light industry sector has taken measures to increase effective market supply; Third, savings that preserve value have attracted part of the consumption funds; Fourth, the purchasing power of social groups has been effectively controlled.

In response, the Ministry of Light Industry proposed a strategic adjustment at the recent national light industry "Double Increase, Double Efficiency" conference: to take the market as the guide, further adjust the product structure and production tasks, and ensure effective market supply; to strive to open up international markets, expand exports and earn foreign exchange, and push surplus domestic products to the international market.

    轻工市场风云变幻  生产消费两头受挤
    战略对策：调整产品结构  开拓国际市场
    据新华社北京8月24日电　（记者李升旗、杨理科）担当消费品生产70％任务的轻工企业，今年下半年出人意料地出现了轻工产品大面积滞销，市场急剧疲软。
    轻工业部主管生产的权威人士提供的信息是：轻工市场风云变幻，生产与消费两头受挤。据了解，今年上半年与去年同期相较，糖、原盐、合成洗涤剂、火柴、肥皂、纸、罐头、电冰箱、洗衣机、电风扇分别增长3.6％至34.5％，而同期这些主要轻工产品的销售量却呈明显的下滑趋势。
    往日的紧俏商品已成昨日黄花，热销一时的电冰箱眼下不得不降价出售，就连至今一些地区仍然凭票供应的食糖、火柴、肥皂、食盐等日用生活必需品销售也在下降，某些产品的下降幅度竟达28％。商业部统计的36种商品，只有4种商品销售比去年上升，其余均下降，这些商品大多数是轻工产品。商业库存增大，企业库存也在上升。
    轻工业部有关人士分析，轻工市场急剧变化主要原因有四：一是中央采取治理整顿措施初见成效，物价涨势减弱，群众恐涨心理缓和，变兑币抢购为持币待购；二是轻工部门采取措施，增加了市场有效供给；三是保值储蓄吸引了部分消费资金；四是社会集团购买力得到有效控制。
    为此，轻工业部在日前召开的全国轻工业“双增双节”会议提出调整战略：以市场为导向，进一步调整产品结构和生产任务，确保市场有效供给；努力开拓国际市场，扩大出口创汇，把国内长余产品推向国际市场。
