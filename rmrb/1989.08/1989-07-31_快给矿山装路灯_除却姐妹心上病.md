In October 1987, the road expansion project in front of our factory was completed, but the streetlights that were removed have not been reinstalled to this day.

Our location is in the western suburbs of Xuzhou City, where there are few pedestrians. Without streetlights, the mine road is pitch black, and our sisters who work the night shift refer to it as the "Jingyang Pass." Recently, a sister from our factory's heat treatment workshop was injured when she was hit by a truck just as she was leaving the factory after her night shift. Her leg was broken. In the darkness, criminals lurk, causing our sisters to be terrified.

The sisters from the Lamp Factory, Curtain Factory, and 16 other enterprises, totaling nearly 1,500, also travel this mine road with great trepidation. When will these dozens of streetlights be installed?

    快给矿山装路灯  除却姐妹心上病
    1987年10月，我厂门前矿山路拓宽路面工程竣工，但当时拆除的路灯迄未安装。
    我们这里地处徐州市西郊，行人稀少，矿山路上没了路灯，一片漆黑，上中夜班的姐妹们称它为“景阳岗”。前不久，我厂热处理车间的一个小姐妹下中夜班，刚出厂门，就被突然驶来的卡车撞断了腿。黑暗中，歹徒拦路肆虐，搞得姐妹们魂飞魄散。
    提心吊胆来往于矿山路的还有灯泡厂、帘子布厂等18家企业的近1500个姐妹。真不知道什么时候才能安装这数十盏路灯？！
