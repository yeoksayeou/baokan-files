Title: Colombia's Anti-Drug Campaign and U.S. Interests

Recently, the Colombian government conducted a large-scale anti-drug operation. Following the arrest of 10,000 suspected drug traffickers and the seizure of hundreds of millions of dollars in assets from drug cartels last week, on August 21, authorities in Bogota and Cali captured a leader of the "Medellin" cartel and confiscated many of the cartel's aircraft. The United States is highly concerned about Colombia's anti-drug efforts, viewing this as a potential turning point in the war on drugs and considering strategies to support Colombia.

Colombia's latest anti-drug operation was carried out under an emergency decree issued by Colombian President Virgilio Barco on August 18. The trigger for this action was the recent surge in activities by Colombian drug cartels, which resulted in the assassinations of a judge, a police chief, and a prominent presidential candidate, Carlos Galan, all of whom were advocates for anti-drug measures. The government was shocked, and the public outraged. It is said that this is the strongest anti-drug operation since Barco took office three years ago.

Colombia's anti-drug efforts are closely tied to U.S. interests. Colombia is one of the major producers of coca in South America, producing 20,000 tons of coca leaves annually, second only to Peru and Bolivia. The drug cartels based in Medellin and Cali in Colombia are the two main groups trafficking cocaine into the United States, controlling 80% of the cocaine entering the country. For years, the United States has assisted the Colombian government in combating drug production and trafficking through financial aid and other means. However, the drug cartels have deep roots in society, and despite Colombia's efforts, large quantities of cocaine are still seized each year. The production of cocaine in illegal labs in Colombia still accounts for a significant portion of the world's supply, making the war on drugs extremely challenging.

The U.S. government's positive response to Colombia's recent anti-drug actions is natural, as these efforts align with the U.S. policy of striking at the source of drugs. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters Robert Gelbard praised the Colombian government's actions, and Representative Charles Rangel, chairman of the House Committee on Narcotics, commended the Colombian government's strong measures. However, the U.S. has not yet formulated specific strategies. While U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh once stated that if the U.S. military were invited to fight the drug cartels in Colombia, the U.S. should send troops, this action is obviously too sensitive. Therefore, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu immediately stated that the U.S. has no plans to send troops, and any support for the Colombian government will focus on "material and resources" rather than combat troops. It appears that this will be the basic policy for U.S. support for anti-drug efforts in South American countries in the future.

    哥伦比亚剿毒与美国的利害关系
    本报记者　张启昕
    最近几天，哥伦比亚政府进行了一次较大规模的剿毒行动，继上周逮捕一万名贩毒嫌疑分子，没收几百万美元的贩毒集团资产后，8月21日又在波哥大和卡利两地抓获一名“麦德林”集团的头目，缴获了贩毒集团许多架飞机。美国对哥伦比亚的剿毒行动极为重视，认为这可能成为反毒战中的一个转机，并正在考虑采取对哥支持的对策。
    哥伦比亚这次剿毒行动是根据哥伦比亚总统巴尔科8月18日宣布的紧急法令采取的，起因是最近一个时期哥伦比亚贩毒集团活动猖獗，几天内先后暗杀了一名法官、一名警察局长和一位知名的总统候选人卡洛斯·加兰，他们都因主张反毒而遭不幸。官方对此感到震惊，公众为之愤慨。据称，这是巴尔科总统执政三年来最强硬的一次剿毒行动。
    哥伦比亚剿毒与美国的利害关系极大。哥伦比亚是南美洲古柯主要产地之一，每年产2万吨古柯叶，仅次于秘鲁和玻利维亚，而盘踞在哥伦比亚麦德林和卡利两地的贩毒集团则是向美国贩运可卡因的两个主要团伙，进入美国的80％的可卡因是由它们控制的。多年来，美国一直通过提供经费等手段协助哥伦比亚政府打击毒品生产和贩运。但贩毒集团在社会上的势力盘根错节，虽经哥伦比亚政府的努力，每年查获大量可卡因，但毒品生产禁而不止，至今哥伦比亚的非法加工厂出产的可卡因仍占世界产量的大部分，反毒战十分艰巨。
    对于哥伦比亚最近采取的剿毒行动，美国官方作出积极反应是十分自然的，因为此举符合美国提出的打击毒品来源的主张。美国国务院负责国际毒品事务的助理国务卿列维茨基称赞哥政府的行动，众议院毒品委员会主席兰热尔对哥政府的强硬措施表示赞赏。然而，目前美国尚未具体作出对策。虽然美国司法部长索恩伯勒一度表示，如果美军应邀去哥伦比亚与贩毒集团作战，美国应该派兵前往，但这一行动显然过于敏感，因此白宫办公厅主任苏努努立即表明美国并没有派兵打算，美国对哥政府的任何支援都将集中在“物力和资源”方面，而不是作战部队。看来，这将是美国今后支持南美国家反毒行动的基本方针。    （本报华盛顿8月22日电）
