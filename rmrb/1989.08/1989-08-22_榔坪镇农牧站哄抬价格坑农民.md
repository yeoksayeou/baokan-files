The agricultural station in Longping Town has seriously violated price policies, inflated seed prices, and exploited farmers, causing widespread anger among the local population. The station has also used its illegal earnings of 7,994.11 yuan to build a house without proper authorization.

From last June to this May, the Longping Agricultural Station sold 54,083 kilograms of corn seeds. The county price bureau set the selling price at 2 yuan per kilogram, but the station sold the seeds at 2.14 yuan per kilogram, violating the price department's regulations. For 1,625 kilograms of rice seeds, the regulated price was 8.26 yuan per kilogram, but the station sold them at 8.52 yuan per kilogram.

In March of this year, the county price bureau, based on public reports, conducted an inspection of the Longping Town Agricultural Station's price execution. It was found that the station had raised seed prices and collected an additional 5,362 yuan in fees. The bureau immediately criticized the station and ordered it to correct the mistake within a specified period. On June 13, the county price bureau sent another inspection team to the station. Instead of correcting the mistake, the station continued to sell seeds at inflated prices, collecting an additional 2,632.11 yuan. According to relevant regulations, the bureau decided to confiscate the station's illegal earnings and return them to the farmers. However, after the decision was made, the Longping Agricultural Station delayed and refused to hand over the illegal earnings, instead giving the price bureau an IOU.

An official from the county price bureau said, "We have handled this matter, but the IOU has rendered our decision ineffective."

    榔坪镇农牧站哄抬价格坑农民
    我县榔坪镇农牧站严重违反物价政策，哄抬种子价格坑农害农，并将非法收入7994.11元用于建房（无批准手续），引起农民的愤慨。
    去年6月至今年5月，榔坪农牧站共销售玉米种子54083公斤，县物价局核定销售价为每公斤2元，该站违反物价部门规定以每公斤2.14元供应给农民；销售稻谷种1625公斤，规定价为每公斤8.26元，该站又以每公斤8.52元销售。
    今年3月，县物价局根据群众举报，对榔坪镇农牧站执行物价情况进行检查，查实这个站提高种子价格，多收价款5362元，当即进行了严肃的批评，并限期纠正。6月13日，县物价局再次派检查组到这个农牧站检查，该站不但没有纠正错误，反而继续坚持提价销售种子，又多收价款2632.11元。县物价局根据有关规定，决定没收该站全部非法收入，退还给农民。但做出决定后，榔坪农牧站软拖硬磨，拒不交出非法收入，却将一张欠条交给物价局。
    县物价局负责人说，这件事情，我们进行了处理。但一张“欠条”使我们的处理决定成为一纸空文。
