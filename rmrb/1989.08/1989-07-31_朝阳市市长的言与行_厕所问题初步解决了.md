On April 20 of this year, the renowned entrepreneur and National People's Congress representative Liu Xiangrong took office as the mayor of our city. At the press conference on the same day, a reporter asked, "Mayor Liu, residents in Chaoyang City face difficulties in finding toilets, a problem that has long gone unresolved. Can you address this issue during your tenure?" Facing the trusting and expectant gazes, Mayor Liu said, "I am a mayor elected by the people, and I must do practical things for the people!"

Building a toilet may not cost much, but it involves a lot of hassle. Over the past two months, Mayor Liu Xiangrong has repeatedly visited residential areas, conducting investigations and meeting with relevant department heads to study plans and assign responsibilities. He also helped to arrange for people, funds, and materials. By July 2, 8 clean public toilets were completed in densely populated residential areas, initially resolving the toilet problem for several residential areas.

During an interview with Mayor Liu Xiangrong, he said, "The people have many things they need the government to do. During my tenure, I will do my utmost to address one practical issue after another for the citizens."

    朝阳市市长的言与行——
    厕所问题初步解决了
    今年4月20日，著名企业家、全国人大代表刘相荣走马上任我市市长。在当天的新闻发布会上，一位记者问：“刘市长，朝阳市区居民上厕所难，长期得不到解决，你任职期间能否解决这个问题？”刘市长面对一副副信任和期待的目光，说：“我是人民选上来的市长，一定要为人民办实事！”
    建一座厕所虽然花钱不多，麻烦事可不少，两个多月中，刘相荣市长多次深入到居民区，一边调查，一边找有关部门的负责同志，研究规划，落实责任，还四处帮助张罗人、财、物。到7月2日，8座整洁的公共厕所在稠密的居民区相继建成，初步解决了几个居民区居民上厕所难的问题。
    记者在采访刘相荣市长时，他说：“人民需要政府办的事很多，在我任职期间，将以最大的努力，一件一件为市民办实事。”
