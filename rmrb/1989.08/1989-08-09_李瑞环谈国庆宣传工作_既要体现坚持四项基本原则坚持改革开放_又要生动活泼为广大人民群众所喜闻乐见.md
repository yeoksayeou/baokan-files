Li Ruihuan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, today held a discussion with cultural department officials on National Day propaganda work. He emphasized that the work should both uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and the policy of reform and opening up, and be lively and appealing to the broad masses of the people.

Li Ruihuan said: This year's National Day has a special significance. All those who have dedicated their lives to the founding of New China, all those who have contributed to the prosperity and great changes of New China, and all those who care about the fate of the motherland are filled with joy and excitement for this grand festival. Our propaganda work should adopt various forms to fully express the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. We have just achieved victory in suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital. We must show through the National Day activities that the capital and other places have restored normal social order and that people are living and working in peace and contentment.

Li Ruihuan said, all levels of Party committees should take the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China propaganda work seriously and do it well. We should seize this good opportunity to make our propaganda work vivid and colorful, creating a festive atmosphere for the grand celebration. We must firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and the policy of reform and opening up, and make our propaganda work lively and appealing to the broad masses of the people. We must proudly proclaim the great achievements of the past 40 years, especially the tremendous results achieved in the past decade of reform and opening up, and use vivid facts to show that only socialism can save China and develop China.

Li Ruihuan required that television, newspapers, radio, and artistic performances, and all other sectors, should act quickly, give their all, and show their strengths. The National Art Festival organized by the Ministry of Culture is a notable important activity in the overall National Day propaganda work, and it must be well-organized. Over the past 40 years, our country's artistic stage has produced a number of enduringly popular songs, dances, dramas, folk arts, poems, and other artistic works, which should be showcased.

Li Ruihuan emphasized in his remarks on the "cleaning up of pornography" that in recent times, various obscene, pornographic, and content promoting violence, murder, and feudal superstitions have flooded the market, seriously poisoning young people and disrupting social stability, damaging the reputation of reform and opening up. A strong public opinion should be created to mobilize all forces to thoroughly investigate and rectify the book and audio-visual markets. All reactionary and pornographic books and audio-visual products should be confiscated and destroyed, and on the basis of concentrated strikes, strengthen daily management work.

Li Ruihuan said that in recent years, the manifestations and harms of bourgeois liberalization in the cultural field cannot be underestimated and must be seriously addressed. At the same time, we should affirm the progress and development of literature and art over the past 40 years, especially in the past 10 years of reform and opening up, and protect the achievements that have been made. We must both oppose bourgeois liberalization and "clean up pornography," and further activate mass cultural life and flourish literature and art. We must handle the relationship between these two aspects.

Li Ruihuan expressed great concern for the current state of mass cultural life in his speech. He said that while firmly "cleaning up pornography," we should promote and protect things that are national, popular, and beneficial to physical and mental health.

Li Ruihuan pointed out in his remarks on the reform and development of China's literary and artistic undertakings that, undoubtedly, we must continue to adhere to the "two for" and "hundred flowers" policies, and continue to encourage various explorations in literary and artistic creation and performance. However, one thing must be affirmed: we should support and promote the excellent cultural traditions of the Chinese nation, and cultivate artistic forms that are characteristic of our nation and popular with the people.

    李瑞环谈国庆宣传工作
    既要体现坚持四项基本原则坚持改革开放
    又要生动活泼为广大人民群众所喜闻乐见
    新华社北京8月9日电  （记者邵建武）“既要坚决反对资产阶级自由化，毫不含糊地扫黄，又要进一步地活跃群众文化生活，繁荣文艺，让大家轻松地欢庆建国40周年。”这番话是中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记李瑞环今天在和文化部同志座谈国庆宣传工作时说的。
    李瑞环说：今年的国庆具有不同寻常的意义。一切为新中国诞生而戎马一生的开国元勋和革命老战士，一切为新中国繁荣昌盛和伟大变革而贡献力量的中华儿女，一切关心祖国命运的炎黄子孙，都对这一盛大节日怀有欢庆与喜悦之情。我们的宣传工作应当采取多种方式，使广大人民群众的这种爱国热情得以充分抒发。我们刚刚取得制止动乱和平息首都反革命暴乱的胜利，要通过国庆活动显示首都和各地已恢复正常的社会秩序，人民安居乐业。
    李瑞环说，各级党委要把国庆40周年宣传工作抓紧、抓好。要抓住这个极好机会，把我们的宣传工作搞得有声有色，烘托盛大庆典的节日气氛。既要体现我们坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放，又要生动活泼，为广大人民群众所喜闻乐见。要理直气壮地宣传40周年的伟大成就，特别是近十年来改革、开放所取得的巨大成果，用生动的事实说明，只有社会主义才能救中国，才能发展中国。
    李瑞环要求，电视、报刊、广播和文艺演出等各路大军，迅速行动起来，全力以赴，各展所长。文化部举办的全国艺术节是整个国庆宣传中一项引人注目的重要活动，一定要下力量把它办好。建国40年来，我国文艺舞台上产生了一批久演不衰的歌曲、舞蹈、戏剧、曲艺、诗歌等文艺作品，应把这些优秀成果拿出来展播。
    李瑞环在谈到“扫黄”时强调指出，一段时期以来，各种淫秽、色情以及宣扬暴力凶杀、封建迷信等内容的书刊和音像制品充斥市场，泛滥成灾，严重地毒害青少年，破坏社会安定、损害改革和对外开放的声誉。要造成强大的社会舆论，动员各方面的力量，彻底清查和整顿书刊和音像市场。对反动的、黄色的书刊和音像制品，一律收缴销毁，并在集中打击的基础上，加强日常的管理工作。
    李瑞环说，近几年来，资产阶级自由化在文化领域的表现及其危害不可低估，必须严肃认真地加以解决。同时，应该肯定40年来，特别是10年改革、开放以来文艺的进步、发展，保护已经取得的成果。我们既要反对资产阶级自由化，要“扫黄”，又要进一步活跃群众文化生活，繁荣文艺。要处理好这二者的关系。
    李瑞环在讲话中对当前群众文化生活表示了极大的关注。他说，在坚决“扫黄”的同时，对民族的、群众喜闻乐见的、有益于身心健康的东西，都要提倡和保护。
    李瑞环在谈到我国文学艺术事业的改革和发展时指出，毫无疑问，我们必须继续坚持“双为”方针和“双百”方针，继续鼓励文艺创作和表演上的各种探索。但是有一条必须肯定，我们应该支持弘扬中华民族的优秀文化传统，扶植具有我国民族特色的、为人民群众所喜闻乐见的艺术表现形式。
