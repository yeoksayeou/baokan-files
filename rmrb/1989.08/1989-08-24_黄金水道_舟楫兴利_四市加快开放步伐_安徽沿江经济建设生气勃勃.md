The mighty Yangtze River flows through Anhui for 400 kilometers. Anqing, Tongling, Wuhu, and Ma'anshan, like four shining pearls, are embedded along the north and south banks of this "golden waterway." Over the past decade of reform and opening-up, the total industrial output value of the four cities has increased by 3.25 times, reaching 12.32 billion yuan in 1988. Last year, the total foreign trade procurement value was 380 million yuan, accounting for 30% of the total for 16 cities and prefectures in the province.

In this 400-kilometer-long east-west and 150-kilometer-long north-south stretch along the river, mineral resources are abundant. Iron, copper, pyrite, dolomite, and limestone reserves each account for more than 60% of the province's total. Wuhu and Anqing have transformed from ancient commercial cities into modern industrial cities, with Anqing becoming a new petrochemical base. Ma'anshan and Tongling are steel and non-ferrous metal industrial bases established after liberation. Since 1986, major provincial key projects such as the Anqing Copper Mine, Tongling Phosphate Ammonium Plant, Ma'anshan Aoshan Phosphate Plant, and Wuhu Dongfang Paper Plant expansion projects have been launched, with some already achieving production capacity. The power plants in Tongling, Ma'anshan, and Wuhu have been expanded. The Xiaoyang Village railway hub in Wuhu is basically completed. The Xuanhang Railway and Tongling Yangtze River Bridge are under construction or in the preparatory stages. The four cities' ports are undergoing transformation and construction, with Wuhu's Zhujiaqiao port's three 5,000-ton ocean-going ship berths for foreign trade nearing completion.

While relying on their own strengths to accelerate economic development, the four cities along the river have also made new progress in introducing funds and technology. In 1987 and 1988, the four cities introduced 51 projects. The equipment introduced by the Ma'anshan Steel High-Speed Wire Plant has formed an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons of high-speed wire.

Currently, the four cities have nearly 300 foreign trade enterprises, with 13 enterprises having an export procurement value of over 10 million yuan and products reaching over 500 varieties. The four cities have also established a number of export-earning bases and enterprise groups, such as Wuhu's electrical machinery, leather shoes, metallurgy, and down products groups, Anqing's textile and garment, building materials groups, Tongling's ramie products, chemical, and carpet groups, and Ma'anshan's chemical and metallurgy groups.

    “黄金水道”舟楫兴利　四市加快开放步伐
    安徽沿江经济建设生气勃勃
    本报讯　滔滔长江，流经安徽四百公里。安庆、铜陵、芜湖、马鞍山四市，宛若四颗熠熠发光的明珠，镶嵌在这段“黄金水道”的南北两岸。改革、开放十年间，四市工业总产值增长3.25倍，1988年达123.2亿元；去年外贸收购总值3.8亿元，占全省16个地、市总和的30％。
    在这东西400公里，南北150公里的沿江地带，矿产资源丰富，其中铁、铜、硫铁、白云石、石灰石等矿产储量均占全省60％以上。芜湖、安庆已实现由古老商业城向现代工业城的转变，安庆市还成为新兴的石油化工基地；马鞍山、铜陵是解放后建成的钢铁工业基地和有色金属工业基地。1986年后，安庆铜矿、铜陵磷铵厂、马鞍山凹山选磷厂、芜湖东方纸版厂扩建工程等一大批省重点工程项目先后上马，有的已形成生产能力；铜陵、马鞍山、芜湖三个电厂进行了扩建；芜湖小杨村铁路枢纽工程已基本完工；宣杭铁路、铜陵长江大桥正在施工或作施工的前期准备；四市港口加紧改造建设，芜湖朱家桥三个5000吨海轮泊位的外贸码头已接近完工。
    沿江四市在依靠自身力量、加快经济发展的同时，引进资金和技术也取得了新进展。1987、1988两年，四市共引进51个项目。马钢高速线材厂引进的设备，已形成年产高速线材40万吨的生产能力。
    目前，沿江四市出口创汇企业已发展到近300家，出口收购额在1000万元以上的企业13家，产品达500多种。四市还建立了一批出口创汇基地和企业集团，如芜湖的电机、皮鞋、冶金、羽绒制品集团，安庆的纺织服装、建材集团，铜陵的苎麻制品、化工、地毯集团，马鞍山的化工、冶金集团等。
