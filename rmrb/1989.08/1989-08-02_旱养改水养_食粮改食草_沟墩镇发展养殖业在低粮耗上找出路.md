Since last autumn, Goutun Town in Funing County, Jiangsu, has been affected by the grain situation, with feed shortages and price increases, leading to a crisis in the livestock industry. They have come to realize that with China's large population and limited land, the carrying capacity of agriculture will struggle to support grain-intensive livestock projects for sustained, high-speed development. Only by adjusting the structure, reducing grain consumption, and increasing efficiency can the livestock industry have a broad development prospect.

Pig farming consumes approximately 150,000 tons of grain annually in the town. Fish farming, on the other hand, used only one-eighth of the grain used for pig farming last year and produced 680 tons of fresh fish, equivalent to one-quarter of the annual pig meat production, with total revenue far exceeding that of pig farming. Inspired by these figures, they proposed shifting the focus of livestock development from "land" to "water," leveraging the town's extensive water network and large areas of shallow water to promote freshwater aquaculture, gradually replacing pig production as the mainstay.

At the beginning of the year, they raised 7.2 million yuan to build 920 mu of intensive fish ponds, increasing the town's intensive fish pond area to over 3,000 mu. Simultaneously, they improved contract management and provided technical guidance to encourage thousands of households to use rivers, ditches, ponds, and rice fields for fish farming. Currently, nearly 4,000 mu of natural water surfaces in the town have been stocked with fish, and over 3,000 households have built fish nests in their fields, expanding rice field aquaculture to 3,500 mu.

Since the beginning of the year, they have calculated the benefits for farmers, encouraging them to raise more sheep, rabbits, geese, and ducks, which are herbivorous or omnivorous. In just a few months, 40% of the households have raised one or two sheep, and many households have raised about ten rabbits. They have also organized various farms to raise more geese and ducks. Although the town's broiler chicken farming has decreased, the number of geese and ducks raised has increased nearly fivefold, with 85 households raising over 200 geese each. The town has also improved the fish farming model, with 40% grass carp and mandarin fish (which are herbivorous) and 50% silver carp and bighead carp (which are filter feeders) being released. This ensures production while replacing feed with grass, saving nearly 100 tons of feed annually for the town.

    旱养改水养　食粮改食草
    沟墩镇发展养殖业在低粮耗上找出路
    去秋以来，江苏阜宁县沟墩镇受粮食形势影响，饲料紧缺，价格上涨，养殖业出现危机。他们清醒地认识到，我国人多地少，种植业的承受力将难以支撑耗粮型养殖项目的持久高速发展。只有调整结构，低粮耗，高效益，养殖业才有广阔的发展前景。
    养猪，全镇年耗粮约1.5万吨。养鱼，去年仅投喂了相当于养猪用粮的1／8，就产出鲜鱼680吨，相当于年养猪产肉量的1／4，总收益远高于养猪业。从这笔帐受到启发，他们提出把发展养殖业的重点从“岸上”移到“水里”，利用水网纵横、荡滩面积大的优势，大力发展淡水养鱼，逐步取代生猪生产的骨干地位。年初，他们集资720万元，建成920亩精养鱼池，使镇办精养鱼池面积超过3000亩。同时，从完善承包合同、辅导科学技术入手，引导千家万户利用河沟、塘洼、稻田养鱼。目前，全镇已有近4000亩河沟、塘洼等自然水面放养了鱼种，还有3000多农户在田间修了鱼窝，使稻田养鱼面积发展到3500亩。
    年初以来，他们向农民算效益帐，动员多养羊、兔、鹅、鸭等食草性、杂食性畜禽。几个月来，已先后有40％的农户养了1至2只羊，许多农户养了10只左右的兔。他们还组织各炕坊多炕鹅鸭。这样，虽然全镇苗鸡饲养量有所减少，但鹅鸭的饲养量却增了近5倍，其中养鹅200只以上的就有85户。镇里还对养鱼模式做了改进，投放的草鲲、鳊鱼等食草性鱼种和花鲢、白鲢等肥水性鱼种分别占40％和50％。在保证产量的前提下，以草料代饲料，仅此一项，全镇可节省饲料近百吨。
