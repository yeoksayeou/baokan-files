Leaders of Wen'an County, Hebei Province, lead by example in clean governance, promoting the anti-corruption campaign and building a clean government.

The leaders of the Wen'an County Party Committee and the county government still live in the flat-roofed houses built in the 1950s, using the money for urgent needs. In the past two years, the county has allocated more than 5 million yuan to build a first-class county-level people's hospital and a veterans' home, and to renovate streets and transform the county seat.

Among the county-level leaders, no one has a house that exceeds the standard, and no one has used connections or backdoors for employment or children's education.

Some officials and staff in the county's direct organs have houses that exceed the standard or have two houses, and the masses have opinions. The county Party Committee and the county government started investigating from the deputy bureau-level cadres, cleaning up the houses that exceed the standard. So far, 13 bureau-level cadres in the county's direct organs have handed in their houses that exceed the standard.

From our reporter in Urumqi, August 7th: The Xinjiang Transportation Bureau Chief and Deputy Secretary of the Bureau Party Committee, Juma Shaibiti, who demanded money from foreigners, was recently removed from his position as Deputy Secretary of the Bureau Party Committee by the Autonomous Region Party Committee, and it was recommended that his administrative position be removed.

Last September, during Juma Shaibiti's visit to Japan leading the Xinjiang Transportation Bureau's road inspection team, he not only arbitrarily divided the 165,000 yen miscellaneous expenses, but also borrowed money from Japanese businessmen through others. The Japanese businessmen gave him 60,000 yen in miscellaneous expenses, which he gladly accepted. In addition, the Japanese side, under the pretext of buying small gifts for the members of the inspection team, gave 25,000 yen, which Juma Shaibiti agreed to accept.

He also used the receipt for the 10,000 yen departure fee paid by the Japanese businessmen as part of the miscellaneous expenses, and took out another 10,000 yen from the miscellaneous expenses to buy things and distribute them to each member of the inspection team.

Throughout the inspection period, Juma Shaibiti obtained a total of 100,000 yen in privately divided public funds and Japanese donations, and bought items such as a video recorder to bring back.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Discipline Inspection Commission issued a circular on the serious violation of diplomatic discipline by Juma Shaibiti and others, urging party members and cadres to take it as a cautionary tale.

    文安县领导带头廉洁奉公  新疆交通厅长索贿被撤职
    据新华社石家庄8月7日电　（通讯员马海程　陈则珍）河北省文安县委、县政府领导带头廉洁奉公，推进反腐败斗争和廉政建设。
    文安县委、县政府领导至今还住着五十年代的平房，而是把钱用在急需的地方。县里近两年拿出500多万元建起了全省第一流的县级人民医院、烈军属敬老院，并整修街道，改造县城。
    在县级领导中，没有一个超标准住房的，没有一个在招工、子女升学中拉关系、走后门的。
    县直机关少数干部职工超标准住房、住双份房，群众有意见。县委、县政府从副局级以上干部查起，清理超标准住房。截至目前，县直机关已有13名局级干部交出了超标准住房。
    本报乌鲁木齐8月7日电　记者曾坤报道：向外商索要钱财的新疆交通厅厅长、厅党组副书记朱马·沙比提，近日被自治区党委撤销厅党组副书记职务，并建议撤销其行政职务。
    去年9月，朱马·沙比提率自治区交通厅公路考察团赴日本访问期间，不但自作主张将16.5万日元的公杂费平均分掉，而且通过别人向日商“借”钱。日商赠送他6万日元的零星费用，他欣然接受。此外，日方还以给考察团成员购买小礼品为名，赠款2.5万日元，朱马·沙比提同意接受。
    他还将日商代付的离日出境手续费1万日元的凭证，抵到公杂费的开支中，又从公杂费中提出1万日元，买东西分给考察团每个成员。
    整个考察期间，朱马·沙比提得到私分公款和日方赠款共10万日元，购买了录像机等物品带回来。
    新疆维吾尔自治区纪委就朱马·沙比提等人严重违反外事纪律一案向全区发出通报，要求党员、干部引以为戒。
