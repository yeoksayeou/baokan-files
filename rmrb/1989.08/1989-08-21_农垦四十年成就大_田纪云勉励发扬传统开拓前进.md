Vice Premier Tian Jiyun Encourages Continuing Tradition and Forging Ahead

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 21st - Vice Premier Tian Jiyun on the 19th at the national agricultural reclamation area leaders' meeting said that the broad masses of workers in the national agricultural reclamation system must earnestly study and implement the spirit of the Party's Thirteenth Plenum of the Fourth Session, continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, be brave in forging ahead, and constantly open up new situations in the agricultural reclamation cause.

    Tian Jiyun fully affirmed the great achievements made by the agricultural reclamation cause after many years of hard work. He said, in the past 40 years, the agricultural reclamation system has reclaimed more than 60 million mu of farmland in deserts and sparsely populated areas, which is equivalent to the farmland area of a medium-sized province; established more than 2,000 state farms and more than 10,000 industrial and commercial enterprises; has more than 5 million workers, with a total population of more than 11 million. The cumulative production for the state is 16 billion jin of grain and beans, 2.29 million tons of dry rubber, and a large amount of meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and other food products as well as other industrial and agricultural products, with a cumulative tax revenue of more than 9 billion yuan. He said, especially since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the agricultural reclamation system has taken economic construction as the center, adhered to the four cardinal principles, adhered to reform and opening up, and its appearance has undergone profound changes.

    Tian Jiyun said, agricultural reclamation workers in the struggle with nature, not only created huge material wealth for the state, but also created precious spiritual wealth, which is the "Beidahuang Spirit" and "Bingtuan Spirit" mentioned by the comrades in the reclamation area. Comrade Wang Zhen summed up the agricultural reclamation spirit in eight words: "Hard Struggle, Brave Innovation." This is a profound summary. I hope the agricultural reclamation system will continue to maintain and carry forward this tradition.

    The national agricultural reclamation area leaders' meeting was held in Beijing from August 17th to 19th.

    农垦四十年成就大
    田纪云勉励发扬传统开拓前进
    据新华社北京8月21日电　国务院副总理田纪云19日在全国垦区负责人座谈会上要求，全国农垦系统的广大职工要认真学习和贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，勇于开拓前进，不断开创农垦事业的新局面。
    田纪云充分肯定农垦事业经过多年的艰苦努力所取得的巨大成就。他说，40年来，农垦系统在戈壁荒原和人烟稀少的地区，开垦出6000多万亩耕地，这相当于一个中等省的耕地面积；建立起2000多个国营农场和1万多个工商企业；拥有500多万职工，总人口1100多万。累计为国家生产粮豆1600亿公斤，干胶229万吨，还为国家提供了大量的肉禽蛋奶等副食品以及其他工农业产品，累计上交税金90多亿元。他说，特别是十一届三中全会以来，农垦系统以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，面貌发生了深刻变化。
    田纪云说，农垦职工在与大自然的搏斗中，不仅为国家创造了巨大的物质财富，而且也创造了宝贵的精神财富，这就是垦区同志们所讲的“北大荒精神”、“兵团精神”。王震同志把农垦精神概括为8个字：“艰苦奋斗，勇于开拓”。这概括得很深刻。希望农垦系统继续保持发扬这个传统。
    全国垦区负责人座谈会8月17日至19日在北京召开。
