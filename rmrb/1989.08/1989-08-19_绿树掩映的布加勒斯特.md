Recently, a visitor shared his impressions of Bucharest, saying, “In terms of ancient architecture and commercial prosperity, it may not compare to many European cities. However, the scenery of layers of trees and layers of buildings is quite attractive to me.”

Good greenery and a beautiful environment are indeed a major feature of Bucharest. The several large forests in the suburbs are lush and green, covering an area of nearly 13,000 hectares. Within the city, large parks such as Herăstrău Island, Cișmigiu Island, Freedom Park, and Youth Park have fresh air and a tranquil environment. Shaded paths are hidden under ancient tree canopies, colorful flowers dot the grassy areas between the trees, and water lilies float gently on the lake surfaces. Couples can be seen strolling everywhere. Large and small streets, as well as courtyards, offices, and schools, are hidden among the lush trees for most of the year. Bucharest's suburbs have 10 newly built residential areas, where rows of stylish, harmoniously colored buildings are surrounded by trees and lawns. Some open spaces are even adorned with fragrant flower beds.

Bucharest's greening efforts are among the best in the country's major cities. Currently, the city alone has 25,000 hectares of garden areas. Adding the large forests in the suburbs, each person has over 100 square meters of green space and forest.

Every April is "Spring Greening Month," during which young students and office workers enthusiastically participate in the "Beautify the Capital, Plant a Tree for Everyone" campaign. The municipal gardening department collaborates closely with various offices, schools, and factories to build small gardens, garden paths, and decorative green spaces in the gaps within office, school, and factory courtyards, as well as along the banks of the Dâmbovița River. These small gardens, garden paths, and decorative green spaces are beautifully designed, adding to the city's charm.

Located in the northwest of the city, the Lake of the Mill was once a marsh. A few years ago, people laid green lawns along the lake, built flower beds, and planted rows of weeping willows, making it a popular spot for citizens to relax on holidays. The "Unification" Square in the city center was once a chaotic market. Now it has become a large park with lush trees and fragrant grass.

With the development of urban construction, Bucharest will become even more beautiful.

    绿树掩映的布加勒斯特
    周子荣
    不久前一位客人谈他对布加勒斯特的观感时说：“论古建筑物和商业的兴盛，它虽比不上欧洲许多大城市。可是那一层绿树一层楼的景色，却对我颇有吸引力。”
    绿化好，环境美，确实是布加勒斯特一大特色，市郊的几大片树林，郁郁葱葱，总面积近13000公顷。市内海勒斯特勒岛、齐什朱吉岛、自由公园、青年公园等几座大公园，空气新鲜，环境安逸；林荫小路被古老的树冠遮隐，林间草地上点缀着五颜六色的花朵，睡莲在湖面上轻盈地漂动着，到处可以看到成双结对的游人在散步。大街小巷以至家庭院落、机关、学校一年有大半时间隐没在葱茏树木之间。布加勒斯特近郊有10个新建的住宅区，在一排样式新颖、色调和谐的楼房之间和楼房四周都是树木和草地，有些空地上还嵌有芬芳悦目的花圃。
    布加勒斯特的绿化工作，在全国大中城市中搞得比较好。现在仅市内园林面积就有2.5万公顷，加上近郊的几片大森林，人均有100多平方米的绿地和森林。
    每年4月是“春季绿化月”，青年学生、机关干部，都兴致勃勃地参加“为美化首都，每人栽一棵树”的活动。市园林部门同各机关学校紧密配合，在普遍绿化的基础上，利用机关、学校、工厂院内的空隙、登博维察河滨等地，建设了小花园、园林路和装饰性绿地，供人们憩息和观赏。这些小花园、园林路和装饰性绿地，图案优美，为城市增添了美景。
    位于市内西北方的磨房湖，过去是一片沼泽。几年前人们在湖边铺上了绿色的草坪，修起了一个个花坛，种上了排排垂柳，成了市民节假日休息的好去处。市中心的“统一”广场过去也是一块乱糟糟的杂货市场。现在它已成为一个绿树成荫、芳草遍地的大公园。
    随着市政建设的发展，布加勒斯特市将变得更加美丽。
