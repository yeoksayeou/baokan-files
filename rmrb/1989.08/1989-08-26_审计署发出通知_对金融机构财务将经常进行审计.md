The National Audit Office recently issued a notice requiring all levels of audit agencies nationwide to start conducting regular audits of the financial transactions of banks and insurance companies at the county level (including county branches and sub-companies) and above from 1990 onwards.

The notice from the National Audit Office stipulates that regular audits of the financial transactions of financial institutions should generally be conducted every quarter or every half-year, without issuing audit conclusions. If significant disciplinary issues are discovered in the financial or operational aspects during the audit process, a special audit can be conducted and handled according to audit procedures. At the end of the year, a more systematic audit of the annual financial settlement should be conducted, and an audit conclusion should be issued.

The notice points out that the focus of regular audits will be on the authenticity and compliance of the financial transactions of financial institutions. The main areas to be audited include whether there are issues of withholding and concealing income, falsely listing expenses, and arbitrarily expanding the scope of cost expenditures; whether there are issues of misappropriating credit funds and insurance reserves for the construction and acquisition of fixed assets by the unit itself; special attention should be paid to auditing issues of falsification, exploiting loopholes in reforms, harming national interests, and seeking private gains for small groups and individuals.

The National Audit Office requires that all levels of audit agencies handle disciplinary issues discovered during audits in accordance with relevant state regulations. If local audit agencies make accommodations for major disciplinary issues or reduce the amount of disciplinary funds to be repaid, they must obtain prior approval from the National Audit Office.

    审计署发出通知
    对金融机构财务将经常进行审计
    新华社北京8月26日电　审计署近日发出通知，要求全国各级审计机关从1990年开始，对各银行、保险公司县级（含县支行、支公司）以上分支机构的财务收支进行经常性审计。
    审计署在通知中要求，对金融机构财务收支的经常性审计，一般每季度或半年审计一次，不发审计结论。在审计过程中，如发现财务上、业务上存在重大违纪问题，可进行专项审计，按审计程序办理。年度终了后，对年度财务决算进行比较系统地审计，并作出审计结论。
    审计署的通知指出，经常性审计的重点将是金融机构财务收支的真实性、合规性。主要审计有无截留隐瞒收入，虚列支出和擅自扩大成本开支范围的问题；有无挪用信贷资金和保险准备金为本单位搞基本建设和固定资产购置的问题；特别要注意审计弄虚作假、钻改革的空子、损害国家利益，为小团体和个人谋取私利的问题。
    审计署要求各级审计机关对审计出的违纪问题依照国家有关法规进行处理。地方审计机关若对重大违纪问题作变通处理或对应补缴的违纪资金进行减免，必须事先征得审计署同意。
