Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 4th.

The State Council Degree Committee decided on July 31 to notify the Chinese Academy of Sciences to revoke Fang Lizhi's qualifications as a member of the Astronomy Subcommittee of the Discipline Review Committee and as a PhD supervisor.

The notification states that Fang Lizhi has consistently maintained a reactionary stance of bourgeois liberalization. He has been arrested on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, and is currently fleeing to avoid punishment. The public security authorities are currently pursuing him. According to the provisions of the Regulations on Academic Degrees of the People's Republic of China, the Interim Organizational Regulations of the Discipline Review Committee of the State Council Degree Committee, and relevant documents, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Degree Committee proposed a recommendation. After deliberation, it was decided to revoke his two qualifications.
