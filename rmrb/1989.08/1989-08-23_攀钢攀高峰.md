On August 20, the largest project in the second phase of the Panzhihua Steel and Iron Company, the No. 4 blast furnace, began its firing and heating process. This 1350 cubic meter blast furnace will officially start producing iron in early September, presenting a significant gift for the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China.

Panzhihua Steel is located in the Panxi (Panzhihua-Western Sichuan) region, which is rich in vanadium-titanium magnetite ore. The proven industrial reserves are over 10 billion tons; the reserves of cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, and more than ten other rare metal elements that coexist with it are also astonishing. The region also has abundant water and coal resources, providing favorable conditions for the development of the steel industry. To accelerate the construction of China's basic industries, as early as November 1965, Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally visited Panzhihua, praising it as "blessed with natural advantages" and personally reviewing the construction plan for Panzhihua Steel. Subsequently, Comrades Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Song Renqiong, and Fang Yi also visited Panzhihua Steel, providing multiple instructions for production and construction, which led to the rapid, efficient, and economical development of Panzhihua Steel.

Panzhihua Steel is the first large-scale steel and iron integrated enterprise in China designed, equipped, and constructed by the Chinese themselves. During the construction, the workers carried forward the spirit of "self-reliance and hard work." Starting in 1965, they completed the construction of the No. 1 blast furnace in just five years, which began producing iron successfully. By 1974, the first phase of the project was completed, achieving an annual production capacity of 1.7 million tons of iron, 1.5 million tons of steel, and 1.1 million tons of steel products. Panzhihua Steel's blast furnaces smelt high-titanium vanadium-titanium magnetite ore. Vanadium and titanium are extremely valuable rare metals. How to separately extract vanadium, titanium, and iron during smelting has been a problem that the world's smelting industry has not fully solved for nearly a century. Under the guidance and assistance of relevant experts and professors, the workers of Panzhihua Steel, while producing, also tackled key technical issues, independently creating a new technology for smelting vanadium-titanium magnetite ore using ordinary blast furnaces, achieving new levels of vanadium, titanium, and iron production. Currently, 85% of the vanadium slag in the country is produced and supplied by Panzhihua Steel, not only meeting domestic needs but also being exported to more than 10 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the United States, and India.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, the state implemented a profit retention and remittance system for Panzhihua Steel, which continuously deepened enterprise reforms, leading to rapid production development. It now has more than 130 types of steel and 13 products that have won national and provincial quality product awards, with continuously improving economic benefits. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value increased by an average of 2.27% per year, and the total tax revenue increased by an average of 20.21% per year. By 1986, a total of 1.648 billion yuan in profits and taxes had been realized, fully repaying the state's investment in the first phase of Panzhihua Steel. In 1987 and 1988, profits of 240 million yuan were achieved consecutively, with an expected 250 million yuan in profit for this year.

To fully leverage the advantages of Panzhihua Steel, the state included the second phase of Panzhihua Steel in the key construction projects of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, with a total investment of 3 billion yuan, including the introduction of 200 million US dollars in foreign capital. The project involves the construction of the No. 4 blast furnace, continuous casting, and 1450 strip steel, among other major systems. The second phase of the project began construction in early 1987 and is expected to be fully completed by 1992. Upon completion, the annual production of pig iron, steel, and steel products will reach 30 million tons, 27 million tons, and 22 million tons, respectively, significantly changing the product structure and doubling the output value and profits.

    攀钢攀高峰
    8月20日，攀枝花钢铁公司二期工程中最大的一个项目：四号高炉开始点火烘炉。这座容积为1350立方米的高炉，将在9月初正式出铁，为新中国建国40周年献上一份厚礼。
    攀钢所在的攀（枝花）西（昌）地区，蕴藏着极其丰富的钒钛磁铁矿。据已经探明的工业储量达到100多亿吨；与其共生的钴、镍、铜、锰等十多种稀有金属元素的储量也十分惊人。这里还有巨大的水能和煤炭资源，为发展钢铁生产提供了有利条件。为了加快我国基础工业建设的步伐，早在1965年11月，邓小平同志亲临攀枝花，称赞这里“得天独厚”，并亲自审查了攀钢的建设方案。此后，彭真、薄一波、李鹏、乔石、宋任穷、方毅等同志也先后来到攀钢，对生产建设作了多次指示，使攀钢建设取得了多快好省的效果。
    攀钢是我国自己设计、自己制造设备、自己施工安装建设起来的第一个大型钢铁联合企业。建设中，职工们发扬“自力更生、艰苦奋斗”的精神，从1965年起，仅用5年时间，一号高炉便顺利投产出铁；到1974年一期工程建成，形成了年产铁170万吨、钢150万吨、钢材110万吨的生产能力。攀钢高炉冶炼的是高钛型钒钛磁铁矿，钒钛又是极为珍贵的稀有金属，冶炼中怎样把钒、钛和铁分别提炼出来，这是近百年来世界冶炼史上没有完全解决的难题。攀钢的职工们在有关专家教授们的指导和帮助下，边生产，边攻关，独创了用普通高炉冶炼钒钛磁铁矿的新技术，使钒、钛和铁的产量达到了新的水平。目前，全国85％的钒渣是由攀钢生产供应的，不仅满足了国内的需要，而且还远销英国、法国、西德、美国、印度等10多个国家。
    党的十一届三中全会后，国家对攀钢实行上交利润定额包干的扩权办法，攀钢不断深化企业内部的改革，生产迅速发展，已拥有130多个钢种，13个产品获国家和省的优质产品称号，经济效益持续提高。“六五”期间，工业总产值平均每年递增2.27％，利税总额平均每年递增20.21％。到1986年，累计实现利税16.48亿元，把国家对攀钢一期工程的投资全部拿了回来。1987、1988年连续实现利润2.4亿元，今年可达2.5亿元。
    为了充分发挥攀钢的优势，国家又把攀钢二期工程列入“七五”计划的重点建设项目，总投资达30亿元，其中引进外资2亿多美元，新建四号高炉、连铸、1450带钢等三大主体系统。二期工程从1987年初施工，到1992年全部建成后，生铁、钢、钢材的年产量将分别达到300万吨、270万吨、220万吨，产品结构将有较大改变，产值、利润都将成倍增长。
