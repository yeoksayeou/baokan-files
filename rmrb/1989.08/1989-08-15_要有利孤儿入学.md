Edition: 6

Our institution adopted two orphans in 1986: the sister, Zeng Yan, aged 8, and the brother, Zeng Chao, aged 6. Both are registered as rural residents. Their parents died in a car accident. The siblings were sent to our institution by the civil affairs department of Beishan County. Due to the fact that their household registration and grain ration relationship have not yet been transferred, Zeng Yan, who has reached school age, had to enroll as a "tuition-paying student." Currently, our institution has 8 school-aged children in similar situations, each paying 2400 yuan in fees annually. This "tuition-paying" arrangement will significantly increase the burden on our institution for adopting children. We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to the issue of orphans' school enrollment.

### 要有利孤儿入学

    要有利孤儿入学
    我院于1986年收养了两个孤儿，姐姐曾燕8岁，弟弟曾朝弟6岁，属农村户口。他们的父母均死于车祸。姐弟俩由璧山县民政部门送来我院。由于他们的户口、粮食关系至今没有转来，已到入学年龄的曾燕只得按“议价生”入学。我院现有8个这样的学龄儿童，每年交费2400元，这样“议价”下去，将加大我院收养负担。希望有关部门重视孤儿入学问题。
