The passenger load factor on flights from Hong Kong to mainland China has been gradually increasing since July, and this upward trend continued in August.

A spokesperson for China Airlines told reporters that the passenger volume on several routes from Hong Kong to mainland China was significantly affected in May and June this year. However, since last month, the situation has been improving. Currently, the two main routes, Hong Kong to Beijing and Hong Kong to Shanghai, have an average passenger load factor of 70%, approaching normal levels. Occasionally, the Shanghai route experiences full capacity.
