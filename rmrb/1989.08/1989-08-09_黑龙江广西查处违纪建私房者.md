    Officials in Heilongjiang and Guangxi have recently taken action against individuals who misappropriated public funds and materials to build private houses. The offenders include Yuan Guodong, Zhang Fuxing, and Liu Fuxiang.

    Yuan Guodong, deputy secretary of the Nenjiang County Committee, lives in a 72-square-meter public housing unit with his family of six. In 1988, he built a two-story house of 160 square meters. During the construction, he purchased pine logs at a low price and obtained high-quality bricks. He also demanded wood from the timber company and used official vehicles to transport materials from hundreds of miles away without paying any fees. The total amount of public funds and materials misappropriated was over 7,000 yuan. The Heihe Municipal Committee decided to remove Yuan Guodong from all his party positions and ordered him to return all the misappropriated public funds and materials.

    Zhang Fuxing, acting procurator of the Boli County People's Procuratorate, and Liu Fuxiang, former secretary and director of the Muling County Grain Bureau, used their positions to establish various pretexts to build houses at public expense. The Qitaihe Municipal Committee and the Muling County Committee decided to give both of them a one-year probation period within the party, confiscate their houses, and recommend their removal from their current positions.

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has reported these cases to the entire province.

    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government of the Autonomous Region decided today to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the illegal construction of private houses by officials using their positions. The focus of this investigation is on private houses built by officials and staff in urban areas since 1987. The investigation will cover whether the building permits are complete and legal, whether the land use complies with regulations, and whether the funding and materials for the construction are legitimate. Those found to have issues in these areas will be subject to economic, administrative, party disciplinary, and even criminal penalties depending on the severity of the case. Additionally, all officials and staff who have built private houses must vacate their original public housing immediately.

    黑龙江广西查处违纪建私房者
    本报哈尔滨电　记者武培真报道：侵吞公款公物兴建私房的元国栋、张福兴和刘福祥，最近分别受到黑龙江有关部门的惩处。
    嫩江县委副书记元国栋全家6口人住公房72平方米，1988年又建起一栋160平方米的二层楼房。建房中，他以低价买走樟子松原木和上等砖，并向木材公司索要木材，多次动用机关汽车到数百里外拉料，运费分文未付，总共侵占公款公物7000多元。黑河地委决定撤销元国栋党内一切职务，所侵占的公款公物如数退赔。
    勃利县人民检察院代检察长张福兴，穆棱县原粮食局党委书记兼局长刘福祥利用职权，巧立名目，损公肥私建住宅。七台河市委和穆棱县委决定给予二人留党察看一年处分，房产收归公有，并建议撤销二人现任职务。
    黑龙江省纪委将上述三人问题通报全省。
    本报南宁8月9日电　记者郑盛丰报道：广西壮族自治区党委、自治区人民政府今天决定对利用职权违法违纪建私房的行为进行全面清查，严肃处理。
    广西这次清查建私房，重点是1987年以来干部职工以权谋私在城镇建的私房。清查内容包括：建房手续是否完备、合法；征用土地是否符合法规手续；建房资金和材料来源是否正当等。对在上述各项中有问题的建房者，将视不同情况分别给予经济、政纪党纪直至刑事的惩处。同时还规定，凡建有私房的干部职工，原住公房应立即搬出。
