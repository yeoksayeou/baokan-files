    Shanxi Province's Linfen Region's Fenxi Irrigation District is strengthening the management and repair of water facilities. This year, they invested 2 million yuan, racing against time to complete the repair of the overflow weir and intake dam of the July 1st Canal before the flood season. This has increased the inflow of 28 intakes, benefiting 400,000 mu of farmland directly.
