	The vice chairman of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, Haki Mohamed, said today that the Chinese government's suppression of the riots was both timely and effective. He congratulated the Chinese government on its victory.

	The Somali leader made these remarks during a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to Somalia, Shi Chengjin.

	Mohamed said that exchanges between countries are indispensable, and therefore China's open policy is correct. However, he said, as exchanges between countries increase, some countries attempt to infiltrate others, leading to internal unrest in the latter.

	He said that incidents similar to what happened in China two months ago have also occurred in Somalia.

	He also said that China's adherence to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is correct, and that people can still draw many beneficial things from the combination of Marxism and Chinese reality in Mao Zedong Thought.

	Meanwhile, Ambassador Shi Chengjin briefly introduced to Mohamed the essence of the turmoil and riots that occurred in China, the current situation in China, and its domestic and foreign policies.

    索马里执政党领导人说  中国平暴及时效果良好
    新华社摩加迪沙8月21日电　索马里革命社会主义党副总书记哈基·默哈默德今天说，中国政府平息暴乱既及时又取得了良好的效果。他对中国政府取得的胜利表示祝贺。
    这位索马里领导人是同中国驻索马里大使施承训会晤时说此番话的。
    默哈默德说，国与国之间的交往是必不可少的，因此中国的开放政策是正确的。但是，他说，随着国与国之间交往的增加，某些国家企图对别国进行渗透进而导致该国的内乱。
    他说，类似前两个月发生在中国的事情在索马里也发生过。
    他还说，中国坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想是正确的，人们至今仍可从马克思主义和中国实际相结合的毛泽东思想中得到许多有益的东西。
    与此同时，施承训大使向默哈默德简要介绍了发生在中国的动乱和暴乱的实质、当前中国的形势和内外政策。
