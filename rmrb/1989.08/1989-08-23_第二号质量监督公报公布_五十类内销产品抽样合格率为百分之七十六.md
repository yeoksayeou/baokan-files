Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 23rd.

The second quarter saw the State Technical Supervision Bureau conduct supervision sampling of 50 categories and 1,457 types of domestically sold products. Of these, 1,118 types were found to be qualified, resulting in a sampling qualification rate of 76.7%.

According to the State Technical Supervision Bureau's "National Supervision Sampling Product Quality Bulletin," this round of sampling found 4 categories of products with a 100% qualification rate: electrolytic copper, single-sided printed circuit boards for black-and-white televisions, direct current speed control device control units, and amusement machines. Eighteen categories, including agricultural-grade ammonium bicarbonate and coal mine electric detonators, had qualification rates between 80% and 90%.

The product with the lowest qualification rate in this round of sampling was fire trucks. The 6 manufacturers sampled included most of the domestic fire truck producers, but the results showed that out of 6 products, only 2 were qualified, resulting in a qualification rate of 33.3%. The quality of these products is seriously problematic. The quality of seafood canned goods, which are closely related to people's daily lives, was also poor, with a sampling qualification rate of only 50%. A significant issue was the insufficient net weight. Some enterprises produced extremely poor-quality canned goods, such as the Double Whale brand smoked fish canned by the Qingdao Marine Fisheries Company, the Shanhaiguan brand tomato sauce sardines produced by the Shanhaiguan Canned Food Factory in Qinhuangdao, the Shidao brand small sardines canned by the Shandong Rongcheng Canned Food Factory, and the Changxia brand five-spice small sardines canned by the Shandong Pastoral Industrial and Commercial Company. Additionally, among the sampled high-quality products, there were also unqualified items: 41 national-level high-quality products had 39 qualified, and 274 provincial and ministerial-level high-quality products had 255 qualified.

In recent years, multiple rounds of supervision sampling have identified some enterprises with strong quality awareness and products that meet quality standards, such as the Huaxin Cement Factory in Huangshi, Hubei Province, and the Dalian Canned Food Factory.

In other news, reporter Dong Huanliang reports: Product quality has declined for three consecutive quarters, resulting in economic losses exceeding 10 billion yuan, which is one of the reasons for the current severe economic situation. A responsible person from the China Quality Management Association recently called on all departments and enterprises to quickly shift from a "quantity and efficiency" approach to a "quality and efficiency" approach.

    第二号质量监督公报公布
    五十类内销产品抽样合格率为百分之七十六
    本报北京8月23日讯　记者朱剑红报道：第二季度，国家技术监督局监督抽查了50类1457种国内销售的产品，合格的1118种，抽样合格率为76.7％。
    据国家技术监督局发布的《国家监督抽查产品质量公报》，此次抽查有4类产品的抽样合格率为100％，它们是，电解铜、黑白电视机用单面印制板、直流调速控制设备控制单元和游艺机。抽样合格率在80％—90％的有农用碳酸氢铵、煤矿用电雷管等18类产品。
    此次抽查合格率最低的是消防车，所抽查的6个厂家基本包括了国内消防车的生产厂家，而抽查的结果是，6种产品只有2种合格，合格率为33.3％，产品质量问题严重。与人民生活关系较密切的水产罐头质量也很差，抽样合格率仅为50％，突出的问题是净重不足。有些企业的罐头质量十分低劣，如青岛海洋渔业公司水产品加工厂的双鲸牌熏鱼片罐头、秦皇岛市山海关罐头厂生产的山海关牌茄汁鲭鱼罐头、山东荣成市罐头厂的石岛牌小凤尾鱼罐头和山东牧工商公司昌邑罐头厂的昌峡牌五香小凤尾鱼罐头。此外，抽查的优质产品中也出现了不合格品，41个国优产品合格39个，274个部、省优产品，合格255个。
    在近年来多次监督抽查中，出现了一些质量意识强、产品质量过得硬的企业，如湖北省黄石市华新水泥厂和大连罐头食品厂等。
    又讯　记者董焕亮报道：产品质量连续3个季度滑坡，经济损失超过百亿元，是造成当前经济形势严峻的原因之一。中国质量管理协会负责人日前呼吁，各部门、各企业要尽快从走“数量效益型”的路子转变为走“质量效益型”的路子。
