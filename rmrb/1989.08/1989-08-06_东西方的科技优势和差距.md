The North Atlantic Council held an important meeting in Hamburg, West Germany, from November 13 to 18, 1988, to discuss the future development strategies of the East and West. Henrich Bissov, a member of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and an expert on Eastern issues, presented a report at the conference on the different advantages, focuses, and gaps in the technological development of the East and West. He particularly emphasized the analysis of the current technological status of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and proposed some ideas for strengthening technological cooperation between the East and West. The following is an introduction to some of the main contents of the report:

    Technology has become an important factor in the balance of power between the East and West.

Currently, the United States, Western Europe, and Japan are at the forefront of global technology. The Soviet Union has also taken the lead in certain areas of technology. Recognizing the relative nature of technological development is of great strategic significance for handling East-West relations, North-South relations, and mutual relations among Western industrialized countries. For example, after the war, the emergence of multi-center economic development like the United States, Western Europe, and Japan led to competition among Western industrialized countries, and the competition on the political and economic stages has increasingly shifted towards technological competition. At present, the research in natural sciences and technology has become a comprehensive endeavor. No country in the East or West can say that it is sufficient to develop only certain aspects or fields; instead, all aspects cannot be neglected.

In the early 1980s, the West established the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) to attempt a technological blockade, preventing Eastern countries from participating in international division of labor and making it difficult for them to approach world standards in high-tech fields. This approach resulted in the Eastern bloc developing science and technology independently. During this period, the Soviet Union, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), and the Warsaw Pact member countries clearly realized that basic research and high technology had become direct factors in the balance of power between Western societies and socialist countries. To break free from the Western technological blockade they faced, the CMEA drafted the "Comprehensive Program for Technological Progress" in 1985, aimed at the year 2000.

    The Technological Advantages and Gaps of Eastern Countries

The Soviet Union's scientific level is not low. The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have more than one-third of the world's scientific talent and more than one-fifth of new technology and new process patents. Each million people in the CMEA member countries have 4,000 scientists, while the West has only 1,800. However, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries are significantly behind the West in certain key technological fields, including: mechanical manufacturing technology (robot technology, program-controlled technology), communication technology, membrane technology, fiberglass, optical fiber technology, and computer technology.

The situation of the Soviet Union lagging behind the world in computer applications is quite serious, and some Eastern European countries have even surpassed the Soviet Union in this regard. The hardware production technology of Soviet computers lags behind the West by about 3 to 5 years, while the software production technology lags behind the West by a smaller margin.

In non-key technological fields, the Soviet Union's achievements are more prominent. The Soviet Union's thermonuclear, laser, particle beam, and molecular genetic technologies are at the forefront of the world. Even compared to the United States, the Soviet Union is not inferior in certain aspects, such as in the fields of biotechnology, vacuum technology, ceramic materials, high-pressure physics, and ionospheric research.

In terms of production technology, the Institute of Electric Welding in Kiev, Ukraine, has successfully developed flash butt welding, electroslag casting, suspended casting, and plasma technology to improve the surface quality of steel ingots, which are cutting-edge achievements internationally.

In the field of biotechnology, the Soviet Union is at the forefront of the world in the research on extracting proteins from liquid alkanes and hydrocarbons.

Currently, scientists from both the Soviet Union and the United States are researching new polymers that can replace ferromagnetic materials. When American scientists first manufactured organic magnets, Soviet researchers also invented a magnetic material made entirely of synthetic materials without metal atoms.

In the field of aerospace research, the Soviet Union's lead over the West is indisputable.

In the field of computer technology, East Germany and Hungary have made significant achievements. Since 1987, East Germany has been able to produce its own 32-bit computers. Recently, East Germany also exhibited the first batch of 1-megabit storage switch circuits (the West produced 1-megabit chips in 1985), and plans to mass-produce them in the 1990s. East Germany's metallographic research software and linear optimization software are sold in the West.

Currently, Hungarian scientists have developed various high-tech computer systems for research. Previously, only the United States, Britain, and Japan could produce such systems. In software development and production, Hungarian software is a popular product in the Western market.

    Strengthening Technological Exchange is Important for Both the East and the West

The transfer of technology between the East and West cannot be understood as a one-way street from the West to the East. In recent years, CMEA member countries have sold $50 million worth of technology patents to the West. As of January 1, 1986, there were 1,563 U.S. patents registered in the Soviet Union, and 5,532 Soviet inventions registered in the United States. About 20,000 Soviet patents are protected in 50 countries around the world.

There is great practical potential for technological cooperation between the East and West. The "Eureka" program of the European Community countries and the "Comprehensive Program for Technological Progress" of the CMEA countries both summarize the main development directions of key technologies. Moreover, the common points of "Eureka" and the "Comprehensive Program for Technological Progress" are the same, that is, they all aim to solve problems in the fields of computer technology, robot technology, and biotechnology. Therefore, cooperation in these areas and in aerospace technology research will have important practical significance. Through mutual technology transfer, it can promote new developments in economic cooperation between the East and West.

An effective form of East-West technological cooperation is the establishment of joint ventures. Currently, except for East Germany, other CMEA member countries have established joint ventures of a certain scale and quantity. For example, Hungary now has 200 joint ventures with the West, and the Soviet Union currently has 70. After the United States relaxed the transfer of oil refining technology and computer technology to Eastern countries, some American companies have signed contracts with the Soviet Union to establish joint ventures in these areas. Currently, American companies are negotiating with relevant Soviet departments to purchase Soviet satellite images.

In summary, the transfer and cooperation of technology between the East and West will inevitably promote cooperation in the economic field between the East and West and will help to ease East-West relations, thereby having a positive impact on East-West relations.

    东西方的科技优势和差距
    泰然
    北大西洋委员会于1988年11月13日至18日，在西德汉堡举行了研究东西方未来发展战略的重要会议，西德埃伯特基金会研究所成员、东方问题专家亨里克·比索夫先生在大会上介绍了东西方科技发展的不同优势、重点和差距，特别着重分析了苏联、东欧的科技现状，并提出加强东西方科技合作的一些设想。现将该报告的部分主要内容介绍如下：
        科技已成为东西方力量对比的重要因素
    目前，美国、西欧和日本已居世界科技的领先地位，苏联也已在科技领域的某些方面居领先地位。而认识科技发展状况的相对性，对处理东西方关系、南北关系和西方工业国之间的相互关系都具有重大的战略意义。例如，战后出现了像美国、西欧和日本这样的多中心的经济发展，在西方工业国之间出现了竞争，而且在政治、经济舞台上的竞争已日益向科技竞争方向转移。目前，自然科学和技术的研究已成为全方位的事业，东西方各国都不能说自己只发展某些方面或领域就够了，而是各方面都不能疏忽。
    西方在80年代初成立了巴统委员会，企图实行科技封锁，阻止东方国家参加国际分工，使其难以在高技术领域接近世界水平。这种做法的结果，致使东方集团自力更生地发展科学技术。在此期间，苏联、经互会和华沙条约组织成员国清楚地意识到，基础研究和高技术已成为西方社会和社会主义国家之间力量对比的直接因素。为了摆脱面临的西方科技封锁，经互会于1985年制订了到2000年的“科技进步综合纲要”。
            东方国家的科技优势和差距
    苏联本身的科学水平并不低，苏联和东欧拥有相当于世界1／3以上的科学人才，以及1／5以上的新技术和新工艺专利。经互会成员国每百万居民中有科学家4000人；而西方只有1800人。然而，苏联、东欧各国在某些关键技术领域明显落后于西方，这些领域包括：机器制造技术（机器人技术、程序控制技术）、通信技术、膜技术、玻璃纤维、光导技术以及计算机技术等。
    苏联在计算机应用方面落后于世界水平的状况比较严重，甚至东欧国家中有的已超过了苏联的水平。苏联计算机的硬件生产技术大约落后西方3至5年，软件生产技术比西方落后的少一些。
    在非关键技术领域，苏联的成就比较突出。苏联的热核、激光、粒子束、分子基因等技术领域，居于世界前列。即使同美国相比苏联在某些方面也不相上下，例如在生物工程、真空技术、陶瓷材料、高压物理和电离层等研究领域就是如此。
    在生产工艺方面，苏联基辅巴顿研究所研制成功的闪光对焊法、电渣铸造法、悬浮铸法和改善钢锭表面质量的等离子技术，是当今国际上的尖端成就。
    在生物技术方面，对于从液态烷、碳氢化合物中提取蛋白质的研究，苏联居于世界领先地位。
    目前，苏、美两国的科学家都在研究能够替代铁磁材料的新聚合物。当美国科学家率先制造出有机磁体时，苏联的研究人员也发明了一种完全由合成材料制成的不含金属原子的磁性材料。
    在宇航研究方面，苏联领先于西方是无可争议的。
    在计算机技术方面，东德和匈牙利成就突出。从1987年开始，东德已经能够制造自己的32位计算机。不久前，东德又展出了第一批1兆位存储开关电路（西方是在1985年造出1兆位芯片的），计划在90年代投入批量生产。东德开发的金相学研究软件和线性优化软件已在西方销售。
    目前，匈牙利的科学家已研制出各种高技术研究用的计算机系统。而以往类似这样的系统只有美国、英国和日本才能制造。在软件开发和生产方面，匈牙利生产的软件在西方市场上是畅销的产品。
  加强技术交流对东西双方都具有重要意义
    东西方之间的技术转让，不能只理解为由西方向东方的单行道。近几年内，经互会成员国向西方出售了价值5000万美元的技术专利。截至1986年1月1日，在苏联登记注册的美国专利有1563项，而在美国登记注册的苏联发明有5532项。苏联大约有2万项专利受到世界50个国家的保护。
    东西方的技术合作具有很大的实际可能性。欧共体国家的“尤里卡”计划和经互会国家的“科技进步综合纲要”都概括了关键技术的主要发展方向。而且“尤里卡”和“科技进步综合纲要”的共同点也都是一样的，即都要解决计算机技术、机器人技术和生物技术方面的问题。所以，在这些方面以及在宇航技术研究方面，东西方的合作会具有重要的实际意义，通过彼此的技术转让，可以促进东西方经济合作的新发展。
    东西方技术合作的有效形式是建立合资企业。目前，除了东德以外，其它的经互会成员国都建立了一定规模和数量的合资企业。如匈牙利现已有200家与西方合资的企业，苏联目前有70家。在美国放松石油加工技术和计算机技术向东方国家转让之后，已有一些美国公司与苏联签署了建立这方面的合资企业的合同。目前，美国公司正同苏联有关部门进行关于购买苏联卫星图片的谈判。
    总之，东西方之间的技术转让和技术合作，必然促进东西方在经济领域里的合作，而且有助于东西方关系的缓和从而对东西方关系产生积极的影响。
