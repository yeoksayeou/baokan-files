A household registration official in Linyi, Shandong Province, was arrested recently for accepting bribes over several years in exchange for household registration approvals. The official, Song Meiying, who served as the head of the household registration division of the Linyi Public Security Bureau, was apprehended by authorities.

Following the discovery of the case, a search of Song's home revealed over 150,000 yuan in cash and bank deposits. Bundles of currency were found buried underground and hidden within walls, some of which were moldy and stuck together. The seized items included three refrigerators, three color televisions, two video cameras, six tape recorders and radios, one air conditioner, four sets of high-end furniture, four sofas, and a large quantity of high-end liquor such as Maotai and French cognac, totaling 2,900 bottles. Additionally, there were substantial amounts of dried shrimp, sea cucumbers, prawns, scallops, and various exquisite handicrafts. The list of seized items compiled by the Linyi People's Procuratorate spanned eleven pages.

Ironically, Song Meiying, who had extorted enormous bribes by abusing her authority, was named an advanced worker by her unit every year since 1988. She was also honored as a model Communist Party member by the city and was awarded a third-class merit citation. The Linyi Public Security Bureau had even recommended her for the position of deputy bureau chief.

    临沂一户政科长受贿入狱
    本报济南电　山东临沂市公安局户政科科长宋梅英利用手中掌管的户口审批权，与一些人进行了持续数年的权、钱交易，日前被依法逮捕。
    案发后，从她家中搜出的现金和银行存款就达十五万余元。那埋在地下、藏在墙中的一捆捆人民币，有的已经霉斑点点，粘合在一起。搜查出来的赃物计有电冰箱三台，彩电三台，录相机二台，录音机、收音机六台，空调器一台，高档组合家具、沙发四套，贵州茅台、法国白兰地等中外名酒二千九百余瓶。此外，还有大宗的海米、海参、对虾、扇贝、各种精致的工艺品……临沂市人民检察院封存上述物品的清单，长达十一页稿纸。
    具有讽刺意义的是：利用职权索取巨额贿赂的宋梅英，一九八八年以来年年被本单位评为先进，还被市里评为模范共产党员，记三等功一次；市公安局还向市里推荐她当副局长。
