The Highest Honor in Modern Engineering and Technology
Qian Xuesen Receives the Small Rockefeller Medal

	People's Daily, Beijing, August 4th - Yesterday afternoon, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense and the Chinese Association for Science and Technology held a symposium to warmly congratulate Qian Xuesen, Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology and Senior Advisor to the Science and Technology Commission of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, on receiving the "Small Rockefeller Medal" and the titles of "World-Class Scientist and Engineer" and "Honorary Member of the International Institute of Engineering and Technology."

	This honor was bestowed upon Qian Xuesen on June 29th of this year at the 1989 International Conference on Technology and Technology Exchange held in New York. The award recognized Qian Xuesen's significant pioneering contributions to China's rocket and missile technology, aerospace technology, and systems engineering theory. At the time, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Han Xu, accepted the award on behalf of Qian Xuesen.

	The "Small Rockefeller Medal" is the highest award established by the International Institute of Engineering and Technology in 1982. Each year, it is awarded to no more than three scientists of the highest international standing in the engineering and technology fields, and they are simultaneously inducted into the "World-Class Scientist and Engineer" registry. This is the highest honor that can be achieved in modern engineering and technology. To date, 16 modern scientific experts have been conferred with the title of "World-Class Scientist and Engineer," and Qian Xuesen is the only Chinese scholar among them. This year, along with Qian Xuesen, the recipients of the award also included Dr. Edward Teller of the United States and Dr. Robert Clappier of France.

	Leaders from the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense and the National Association for Science and Technology congratulated Qian Xuesen and enthusiastically praised his decades of diligent work and significant contributions to the scientific cause of New China. They hoped that China's new and old scientific workers, especially the younger generation, would humbly learn from Qian Xuesen's patriotism and his lofty virtue of dedicating his life to the service of the motherland.

	Qian Xuesen spoke earnestly, saying, "Do not emphasize that among the 16 people who received this award, I am the only Chinese. Instead, emphasize that there is a 'Chinese person' among them. I am just a representative. I spent 20 years in the United States, the first 10 years studying, and the latter 10 years actually preparing for my return to the motherland to serve the country. I never thought about staying in the United States for the rest of my life. After returning to the country, I only did a little bit of work within my capabilities, achieving only a tiny bit of success, like a sesame seed. Our achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the older generation of revolutionaries, and the result of the great cooperation of the broad masses of intellectuals and the people of the entire country. Now, the most important thing is to develop our country's next step in high technology."

    现代理工界的最高荣誉等级
    钱学森获小罗克韦尔奖章
    本报北京8月4日讯　昨天下午，国防科工委、中国科协召开座谈会，热烈祝贺中国科协主席、国防科工委科技委高级顾问钱学森同志获得“小罗克韦尔奖章”和“世界级科技与工程名人”、“国际理工研究所名誉成员”的称号。
    这一荣誉，是今年6月29日在美国纽约召开的1989年国际技术与技术交流大会上为表彰钱学森对中国火箭导弹技术、航天技术和系统工程理论作出的重大开拓性贡献而授予的。当时中国驻美大使韩叙代表钱老领了奖。
    “小罗克韦尔奖章”，是国际理工研究所于1982年设立的最高奖赏，每年授予至多3位在国际理工界有极高声望的科学家，同时入选“世界级”科技与工程名人录。这是现代理工界所能入选的最高荣誉等级。到目前为止，接受“世界级科技与工程名人”称号的现代科学专家共有16人，钱学森是其中唯一的中国学者。今年与钱学森一起获奖的还有美国的爱德华·泰勒博士和法国的罗伯特·克拉皮施博士。
    国防科工委和全国科协的领导同志向钱学森同志祝贺，热情赞扬他几十年来兢兢业业对新中国科学事业所做出的重大贡献，希望中国的新老科学工作者，特别是年青的一代，虚心学习钱学森同志的爱国主义精神，用毕生精力报效祖国的崇高品德。
    钱学森语重心长地说，不要强调获得此项奖的16个人中我是唯一的中国人，要强调有一个我们“中国的人”。我不过是个代表就是了。我在美国20年，前10年是在学习，后10年实际上是在为回国后为祖国做事作准备，从来没有想过要在美国待一辈子。我这个人回国后只是做了一点力所能及的工作，只有芝麻粒那么大一点成绩。我们取得的成就，是党和老一辈革命家正确领导的结果，是广大知识分子和全国人民大力协同的结果。现在，最重要的是把我们国家下一步高技术的发展搞好。
