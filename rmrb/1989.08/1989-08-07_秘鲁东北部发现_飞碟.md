    UFOs Spotted in Northeastern Peru
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 7 - Lima: Fifteen "flying saucers" were spotted in the sky over northeastern Peru's Regay province on the morning of August 5.

    According to some Peruvian farmers who spoke to the Lima Express on August 6, they saw the "flying saucers" while driving through a mountainous area about 50 kilometers from the province. The area, known as Cavish, is at an altitude of 5,200 meters.

    The witnesses said the "flying saucers" were arranged in three rows, with about five in each row. They flew at a very high speed and emitted red, blue, and green light beams, which contrasted beautifully with the snow-capped peaks of the nearby Andes Mountains, making the surrounding natural scenery extremely spectacular. Later, the "flying saucers" disappeared over the summit of Mount Bucaralaraju, which stands at 5,346 meters.

    Last September, "flying saucers" were also spotted in the skies over the area near Regay province.

    秘鲁东北部发现“飞碟”
    新华社北京8月7日电　利马消息：秘鲁东北部雷瓜伊省上空5日早晨出现15块“飞碟”。
    据一些秘鲁农民6日对利马《快报》说，他们是在乘车穿越距该省50公里处一海拔5200米、名叫卡维什的山区时发现这些“飞碟”的。
    这些目击者还说，“飞碟”共分三排，每排约5块，其飞行速度很快。它不时发出的红、蓝、绿光束，与附近的安第斯山皑皑雪峰相映生辉，使周围自然景色十分壮观。后来“飞碟”在高达5346米的布卡拉拉胡雪山上空消失。
    去年9月份，雷瓜伊省附近地区上空也曾发现过“飞碟”。
