The 4th unit of the Dongjiang Hydroelectric Station successfully completed a 72-hour trial run and was connected to the grid today. With this, the construction of this nearly 1.1 billion yuan national key energy project, which has been underway for 11 years, is nearing completion.

The Dongjiang Hydroelectric Station is located in the middle reaches of the Lishui River, a tributary of the Xiangjiang River in Hunan. It has four generating units with a total capacity of 500,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation capacity of 1.32 billion kilowatt-hours. The recently completed Dongjiang Hydroelectric Station dam is 157 meters high, 35 meters wide at the base, and 7 meters wide at the top. It is the first double-curvature arch dam designed and built independently by China. Its completion marks China's entry into the international forefront of dam design and construction technology.
