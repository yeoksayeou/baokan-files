    "Iron Oxen for River Control" Unearthed in Yongji County

    According to a report from our newspaper, four "Iron Oxen for River Control" cast during the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty have recently been unearthed in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, and are now on display.

    The four oxen are arranged in two groups, each standing over a meter long and weighing approximately 5,000 kilograms. Their robust forms and lifelike shapes, along with the grand craftsmanship, make them a significant find. Their excavation provides important evidence for the study of the historical development of metallurgy, bridges, water conservancy, and art in China.
