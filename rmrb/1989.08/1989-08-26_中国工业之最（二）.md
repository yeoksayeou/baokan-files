△ Largest power generating unit: Inner Mongolia Yuanbaoshan Power Plant's No. 2 unit. Completed and put into operation in 1985. The first 600,000 kW thermal power generating unit. Jilin Baishan Hydroelectric Power Station's No. 1, 2, and 3 units, completed and put into operation in 1984, are currently the largest three 300,000 kW hydroelectric power generating units.

**Petroleum Industry**

△ Largest oil field: Daqing Oil Field. Completed and put into operation in 1963. Annual crude oil production is 55.29 million tons.

△ Largest refinery: Luoyang Refinery. Under construction. The atmospheric distillation unit has a processing capacity of 5 million tons per year, and the catalytic cracking unit has a capacity of 2 million tons per year.

**Steel Industry**

△ Largest steel and iron integrated enterprise: Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Gradually expanded and rebuilt starting in 1953. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, steel and iron production capacities reached 7 million tons per year each. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, construction was carried out to achieve an annual production scale of 8 million tons of steel, 7 million tons of iron, and 6 million tons of steel products.

△ Most advanced modern steel and iron integrated enterprise: Baoshan Iron and Steel General Plant. The first phase of the project was completed and put into operation in July 1986, and the second phase is under construction. The total construction scale is 6.71 million tons of steel, 6.5 million tons of iron, 3.44 million tons of steel ingots processed annually, 500,000 tons of seamless steel pipes, blast furnace capacity of 4,063 cubic meters, and converter capacity of 300 tons. Advanced production technology and computer management are used, with high-speed automation and unmanned operation.

△ Largest rolling mill project: Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's 1.7-meter rolling mill. Completed and put into operation in 1979. Annual production capacity is 3 million tons of hot-rolled coils, 1 million tons of cold-rolled coils, 1.5 million tons of continuous casting slabs, and 700,000 tons of silicon steel sheets.
