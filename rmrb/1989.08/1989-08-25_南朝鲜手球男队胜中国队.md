The South Korean men's handball team defeated the Chinese team this afternoon in the semifinals of the Asian Handball Championship, with a score of 37:30. As a result, the Chinese team lost the opportunity to compete for the top three positions.

On the court, the Chinese and South Korean teams had similar heights and body types, and their ages were roughly the same. However, once the match began, the differences in their technical styles became apparent. Just a few minutes into the game, the South Korean team had already pulled ahead in the score. Their tactical prowess was evident in their "fast, soft, and clever" approach, with agile footwork, swift passing, and minimal direct confrontations. This strategy is what allowed them to defeat the physically strong European teams in the Olympics.

Today, four other matches were also held: the Japanese women's team defeated the Chinese Taipei team 26:15; the Chinese Taipei men's team defeated the Iranian team 32:28; the Japanese men's team defeated the Qatari team 34:15; and the Kuwaiti men's team defeated the Saudi Arabian team 22:21.

    南朝鲜手球男队胜中国队
    本报北京8月25日讯　记者李北大　刘小明报道：南朝鲜男队，今天下午在亚洲手球锦标赛半决赛中，以37∶30战胜东道主中国队，中国队因此失去争夺前3名的资格。
    场上，中国队与南朝鲜队的队员，身高体型大体一致，年龄相仿。可是，双方一交手，各自技术打法泾渭分明。开场仅几分钟，南朝鲜队便把比分拉开。他们技战术的巧妙之处体现在“快、柔、巧”上，脚步灵活，传球迅捷，很少横冲直撞。正因如此，他们才在奥运会上击败身强体壮的欧洲诸强。
    今天还进行了另外4场比赛，日本女队以26∶15胜中国台北队；中国台北男队以32∶28胜伊朗队；日本男队以34∶15胜卡塔尔队；科威特男队以22∶21胜沙特阿拉伯队。
