In the capital of Cuba, there is a place that children love to go, which is the Arroyo Naranjo Computer Club in Havana.

The club was established at the end of last year with the aim of providing a space for middle and elementary school students during their free time, allowing them to enter the field of computers and create favorable conditions for using and mastering this modern technology in the future.

The club has a software room, a hardware room, a library, and more. In the software room, children can learn to write computer software and operate it. In the hardware room, children can learn methods to repair computers. In the library, children can look up information related to computers. In addition, the club also offers computer theory courses. This club has attracted children from the surrounding area. More and more children are coming, and it is almost full. A seventh-grade student named Carlos Menéndez anxiously told his classmates, "Everyone wants to come, what should we do in the future?" A teacher at the club said that to satisfy the children's desire for knowledge, the club plans to expand its area and install more computers.

    孩子们的乐园
    在古巴首都有一个孩子们喜欢去的地方，那就是哈瓦那阿罗约·纳兰霍计算机俱乐部。
    这个俱乐部创办于去年底，目的是在课余给中、小学生提供一个园地，使他们有机会进入计算机领域，为今后使用和掌握这一现代技术创造有利条件。
    俱乐部设有软件室、硬件室、图书馆等。在软件室，孩子们可以学习编计算机软件和操作；在硬件室，孩子们可以学习检修计算机的方法；在图书馆，孩子们可查阅有关计算机的资料。此外，俱乐部还开有计算机理论课程。这个俱乐部吸引了附近的孩子们。孩子越来越多，几乎人满为患。一个叫卡洛斯·梅嫩德斯的7年级学生着急地对同伴说：大家都想来，以后怎么办呢？俱乐部的一位老师说，为满足孩子们的求知欲望，俱乐部准备扩大面积，再安装一些计算机。
