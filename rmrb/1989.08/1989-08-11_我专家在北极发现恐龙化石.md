Chinese paleontological expert Dong Zhimin recently discovered dinosaur fossils in the Arctic during a Sino-Canadian joint expedition.

The leader of the Sino-Canadian expedition team, Dr. Russell from the Canadian Museum of Nature, announced at a press conference held here today that the fossils were found at the fossil site on Bylot Island in northern Canada. The site is located at 78 degrees 45 minutes north latitude, making it the world's northernmost dinosaur fossil site.

This time, a lower jawbone of a hadrosaur was discovered. Experts estimate that this dinosaur fossil dates back to the late Cretaceous period, approximately 70 million years ago. The expedition was organized by the "Sino-Canadian Dinosaur Cooperation Program" and began on July 7, concluding on August 7.

Dong Zhimin, a dinosaur expert from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, participated in this expedition. In addition to the dinosaur fossils, the expedition team also discovered fossils of plesiosaurs and giant marine lizards in this region.
