In the special struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the soldiers of the martial law troops used their loyalty and blood to create and carry forward the inspiring spirit of "Guardians of the Republic." This spirit is mainly manifested in the following aspects: a clear and firm stance and belief in defending the Party, the country, and the people; a high spirit of self-sacrifice, bearing humiliation and bravely sacrificing oneself to awaken the people; a brave and tenacious revolutionary heroism, fighting relentlessly and fearlessly; and a hardworking and disciplined spirit, loving the people and being the people's army.

I. At the critical moment of the Party and the country's life and death, the broad masses of officers and soldiers unshakably executed the orders of the Central Committee of the Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, demonstrating a high level of political awareness and a firm political stance.

After mid-April, a small number of people planned a student movement that quickly developed into an organized, planned, and premeditated political turmoil. To stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council decided to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing. Upon receiving the order, the troops heading to Beijing immediately set out, traveling day and night to reach the capital. Many units received the order one day and set out the same day, mobilizing and moving out while still in formation. Some units gathered from within a radius of hundreds of miles, with soldiers carrying dirt and sweat from training grounds and construction sites, hastily setting out on their journey. Some returned from duty points and production sites, got off the trucks and onto the trains without even entering the barracks.

The emergency mobilization was like an exam, testing each officer and soldier's loyalty to the Party and tempering the soldiers' belief that "the interests of the motherland are above everything, and everything is sacrificed for the motherland." Some had just received a telegram about a critically ill family member, some had wives and children visiting the unit, some had just been approved for leave to visit home, and some had just received their marriage certificates and were preparing to be grooms. However, for the call of the republic, many comrades deeply cherished their emotions and resolutely set out. The deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, martyr Ma Guoxuan, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," had his fianc√©e come to the unit the day before he set out to Beijing, preparing for their wedding. The leader wanted him to stay, but he declined the leader's concern and resolutely set out with the unit to the capital. As they advanced towards Tiananmen Square, he told his platoon, "Now is the time of national crisis, the Party is in crisis. No matter how great the difficulties, we can only move forward, not retreat. As long as we have a breath, we will crawl to Tiananmen." He practiced his oath with loyalty and blood. He did not get to marry his beloved, but the People's Republic will forever remember his immortal merits.

A small number of people, for counter-revolutionary political needs, leaked the secret two days before the martial law was announced, allowing the illegal organization "High Autonomous Federation" to preemptively announce the end of the hunger strike at the capital's party, government, and military cadres' meeting on the evening of May 19. At the same time, they planned and incited the masses to block the martial law troops. They infiltrated the streets and alleys and residential areas, distorting right and wrong, deceiving the masses, shouting things like "The PLA is entering the city, tanks are coming to Tiananmen to crush the students," and even feigning pitifully, "Uncles and aunts, the PLA is imposing martial law on Beijing, suppressing the students," and so on. Many uninformed masses went out to the streets under such circumstances. The "High Autonomous Federation" gang, to achieve their evil goal of stopping the implementation of martial law, used various counter-revolutionary tricks against the martial law troops: first, blocking and besieging. They set up heavy barriers at the main roads where the troops were advancing, let the air out of the military vehicles' tires, and did not allow them to move forward. At the same time, they surrounded the military vehicles, not allowing the troops to get off the vehicles, eat, drink, or sleep for days and nights, attempting to wear down the troops. Second, spreading rumors and slandering. They wrote slogans on the military vehicles, threw reactionary leaflets into the vehicles, and gave reactionary speeches. Third, attempting to split and subvert.

Facing these blockades, ridicule, insults, beatings, and attempts to split and subvert, the troops were caught off guard. They repeatedly studied the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party and the Central Military Commission on the vehicles that were besieged, calmly analyzing the harm that the turmoil brought to the Party and the country. The officers and soldiers became even more vigilant and firm in their beliefs: those who planned and organized the turmoil were absolutely not engaged in some "patriotic" and "democratic" movement; their speeches and actions were aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and subverting the People's Republic of China. The officers and soldiers firmly believed in the correctness of the Central Committee's decision, and they executed the martial law mission, fulfilling their duty to defend the Party, the country, and the people, with righteousness and honor.

More than 1,000 officers and soldiers of a certain unit were blocked at Shanhao Station in the suburbs of Beijing. The "High Autonomous Federation" incited more than 10 schools to propagate against martial law to the troops. For two whole days and nights, the troops endured hunger and thirst, singing songs like "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" to uphold justice, marching in formation to display military discipline, helping to clean the station and wash the vehicles. At the same time, they sent batches of officers and soldiers to the masses and students to propagate the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party and the necessity of martial law. The troop leaders also invited the students for a discussion, saying, "You keep talking about democracy and freedom, but now you don't let the soldiers eat, drink, or rest, not even giving them the basic human freedom. What kind of democracy and freedom are you talking about?" The students were speechless, and many left in shame, saying truthfully, "Now we believe in the PLA. It was the 'High Autonomous Federation' that arranged for us to come, and we will be punished if we fail to complete the task." In another area, the troops were besieged for three days and nights without getting off the vehicles. The troops were extremely tired, but the officers and soldiers had no complaints. The firm attitude of the officers and soldiers foiled the evil plot of a small number of people to split and subvert the martial law troops.

II. Facing the complex situation where a few rioters and uninformed masses were mixed together, the broad masses of officers and soldiers bore humiliation and bravely sacrificed themselves, demonstrating a high spirit of self-sacrifice to awaken the people with blood.

On June 3, after the counter-revolutionary riot broke out, to quickly quell the riot, the martial law troops were ordered to forcefully advance into the city. The planners and organizers of the riot gathered a group of people who harbored deep hatred for the Communist Party and the socialist system, buying thugs and distributing wooden sticks with nails, knives, and a large number of stones, steel bars, Molotov cocktails, and other weapons on more than ten roads leading to the city. They brazenly blocked the military's advance, sometimes openly armed, crazily engaging in smashing, looting, arson, and killing, and sometimes coercing some people to act as shields, pushing many uninformed masses to the front line.

Such a sharp and complex situation was unprecedented in any military operation the PLA had conducted in the past few decades. Due to the presence of a few rioters among the masses, to avoid injuring the masses, many decisive measures of the martial law troops were difficult to implement. Otherwise, the armed PLA could not be stopped? Tanks and armored vehicles could not break through any obstacles? It was precisely to protect the masses that the troops endured humiliation, shed tears, and even sacrificed their lives. On the early morning of June 4, the soldier Zhou Guozheng of the Second Platoon of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," was blocked at Chongwenmen with his platoon. The car stalled when it turned around. The rioters swarmed over, set the car on fire, and 12 officers and soldiers got off the car to break out. Zhou Guozheng and his comrades were forced to retreat to the bridge. The rioters took the opportunity to attack, and Zhou Guozheng was brutally beaten. The rioters threw the unconscious Zhou Guozheng off the bridge and poured gasoline on him, burning him to death. A civilian snatched Zhou Guozheng's submachine gun, and the soldiers saw that the bullets given to Zhou Guozheng before departure were all pressed in the magazine, not missing a single one. Zhou Guozheng, with his spirit of sacrificing himself to save the masses, composed a new era's song of love for the people!

Blood is hard to come by, and bearing humiliation is not easy. Our young soldiers, whose personal dignity is not inferior to anyone else's, and whose lives are as valuable as anyone else's, but for the sake of protecting and educating the masses, for the sake of exposing the crimes of the rioters, and for the sake of seizing the political initiative, they took many measures of restraint. Some soldiers, to control their potentially explosive emotions, wrote a big "endure" on the shoulder bags they carried. The platoon leader You Degao of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," led his platoon to be besieged at the Muxiyuan Overpass. An over-50-year-old woman who did not understand the situation forced her way to the front of the formation, pointing at You Degao's nose and cursing, and spitting in his face. You Degao endured this unprecedented humiliation in his life, silently wiping away the spit, and did not retaliate. Suddenly, the restless crowd knocked the woman to the ground, and she was about to be trampled or killed. You Degao took a step forward, using his back to fiercely resist the surging crowd, and pulled the woman up. The woman was saved, walked away in shame, and You Degao's hand was skinned and bleeding. As they continued to advance, a rioter took advantage of his moment of inattention and swung an iron bar at his head, leaving a four to five-centimeter-long wound. To defend himself, he drew his gun, turned around to aim at the rioter only a few steps away, but seeing the many onlookers behind the rioter, he silently put the gun back. At that moment, a brick flew towards him, and his face was hit with a three-centimeter-long wound. Then, the rioter hit him on the waist with a stick. He fell to the ground, and sticks, steel bars, stones, and bricks rained down on him, leaving him severely injured and bloody. He fainted, and the ruthless rioters stripped off his clothes and continued to beat him. Later, fortunately, two police officers risked their lives to send him to the hospital. He had 17 injuries on his body, and 14 stitches on his head and face, leaving him with severe post-concussion syndrome. You Degao did not regret it when he woke up. He said, if his blood could awaken the masses' consciousness, it was worth it. This is the breadth of our soldiers, and this is the voice of our soldiers.

To quell the riot, the advancing troops, in a situation of unbearable and unavoidable circumstances, fired warning shots, and even at this time, the officers and soldiers still did their utmost to avoid injuring the masses. A certain regiment advanced from Liujia Bridge to Tiananmen Square. The vanguard was blocked at Guang'anmen Bridgehead. As the rioters shouted wildly, bricks and stones rained down, and many comrades were knocked down. The soldiers raised their blood-stained and tear-stained faces, wanting to fire back at the rioters, but seeing the dense crowd of onlookers, they endured and advanced quickly. When this regiment reached the designated location, from the regiment commander to the soldiers, 100% were beaten, and 85% were injured, including 149 seriously injured. Facing the flying bricks and stones, and the wildly swinging iron bars, facing the danger of injury and death, the troops restrained and yielded. Were the troops in the wrong? Absolutely not! The troops were righteous and honorable in restoring order in the capital. Were the troops cowardly? Even more not! Whether charging into battle or rescuing in disasters, our army has always been fearless and unyielding. In the past few decades, our army has defeated powerful enemies both domestically and internationally. Then, why this time? It was because they faced a special struggle. The more than ten martyrs who were awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic" all had guns in their hands and bullets in their guns, but they were all brutally killed by rioters in the midst of tens of thousands of uninformed masses who were besieging them, without firing a shot at the crowd. They used their young lives and bright red blood to show that our army is a people's army led by the Party, serving the people wholeheartedly. They showed a deeply moving page in the spirit of "Guardians of the Republic." In the entire process of quelling the riot, the martial law troops had more than 6,000 injured and dozens of martyrs, and more than 1,000 vehicles were destroyed. This high price is both ironclad evidence of the rioters' extreme ruthlessness and an immortal record of the people's army's restraint, self-sacrifice, and protection of the masses!

III. When the troops were fiercely attacked by counter-revolutionary rioters, the broad masses of officers and soldiers fearlessly and bravely fought, displaying a fearless revolutionary heroism.

The rioters knew that the day the martial law troops reached Tiananmen Square and other designated locations would be their day of doom. Therefore, they crazily blocked, besieged, and burned military vehicles, viciously snatched weapons and ammunition, brutally beat and kidnapped soldiers, and particularly shocking was that they poured gasoline on the bodies of soldiers who were brutally killed, set them on fire, and left them to rot in the streets, a gruesome sight.

When the troops were seriously obstructed and faced heavy difficulties on their way forward, the officers and soldiers bravely advanced, breaking through obstacles. The vanguard troops advancing from the western suburbs of Beijing to Tiananmen Square were tasked with opening the way for the following troops and clearing the square. At that time, the ten-mile Chang'an Street was filled with rioters spreading rumors and inciting chaos, and many uninformed masses blocked the streets. The main roads were filled with layer upon layer of obstacles, causing great difficulties for the troops' advance. The leaders at all levels ordered the troops to get off the vehicles. They formed teams on both sides of the vehicles, protecting the vehicles with people, moving with the vehicles, and looking out for each other. The officers and soldiers sang heroic military songs and shouted loud slogans, advancing forward one after another. When the troops reached Fuxingmen, the rioters had already placed public buses, trucks, and trailers in the middle of the road and set them on fire. Immediately, thick smoke billowed, and flames roared, scorching people so they couldn't get close. The officers and soldiers, disregarding their lives, rushed towards the cars that could explode at any moment, pushing them with their hands, shoulders, and poles. Many people's clothes were on fire, and their hands, faces, and arms were burned, but they endured the pain and continued to fight, finally pushing the burning cars to the side of the road, ensuring the troops' continued advance. Especially the reconnaissance team of a certain unit, which was responsible for opening the way, walked 18 miles on foot, clearing obstacles. All 48 officers and soldiers were injured, but no one left the battlefield. When they passed by Zhongnanhai, they saw some rioters crazily attacking the guard soldiers and storming Zhongnanhai. This reconnaissance team, with their skilled capture and combat techniques, subdued the rioters and captured six ringleaders, resolving the crisis at Zhongnanhai. Later, they continued to advance, and after more than five hours of hard fighting, they finally reached the designated location. The reconnaissance company of a certain unit, which was awarded the title of "Vanguard Company of Crossing the River" in the war years, received the task of destroying the command center of the illegal organization "High Autonomous Federation" on Tiananmen Square at dawn on June 4. Although the entire company had not eaten or slept for a day and a night, their fighting spirit was very high. With the cooperation of brother companies, they destroyed the "High Autonomous Federation" command center in just 30 minutes. The entire operation was swift, decisive, neat, and secure, making a special contribution to the smooth clearing of the square. The troops that arrived at the square one after another divided into groups, continuously fought, and foiled the rioters' attempt to burn down the Tiananmen City Gate with Molotov cocktails and gasoline bombs. They blocked the rioters who tried to rush into the square again at various entrances and exits. In the situation where the students who were stranded in the square were peacefully evacuated, they quickly completed the clearing task, ending the situation where the square was occupied by illegal organizations and counter-revolutionary rioters, and returning it to the people.

Many officers and soldiers, even when seriously injured and facing the threat of death, still fearlessly and bravely fought, risking their lives to quickly reach the designated location, to rescue weapons, save comrades, and protect the masses. The platoon leader Liu Guobing of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," drove a car through the rioters' fierce attacks, bypassed the obstacles, and broke through the siege. When he reached the north side of the Great Hall of the People, he had already been injured in two places. He heard that there were still three cars, 82 comrades, and a batch of guns, ammunition, and radios behind him that needed to be rescued, so he volunteered and fearlessly rushed back. When he was beaten by the rioters, he bravely broke through the siege and, without hesitation, rescued the comrades and weapons behind him. After being seriously injured, the rioters poured gasoline on his body and set him on fire. He bravely rushed towards the rioters, determined to perish with them. Liu Guobing, with his young life, composed a heroic song of sacrificing his life to save others and leaving the danger to himself. The driver Zhang Zhen of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," was driving a car on the night of June 3 and was suddenly attacked by a group of rioters at the Yongding Road intersection. The four windshields of the driver's cab were smashed, and his head was hit with a five-centimeter-long wound, and his skull was injured, with blood flowing down. The officer in charge of the car bandaged him with an emergency kit, but the bleeding still did not stop. He took a few painkillers, rallied his spirits, and continued to drive. Due to excessive bleeding, he was dizzy and in severe pain, so he drank a sip of water after driving a short distance, and with one step and a drop of blood, he persisted for five hours. When the car reached the Xidan intersection, it was again attacked by rioters with firearms. Zhang Zhen was injured in 11 places on his chest and shoulders. The officer next to him asked if he could still hold on, and he struggled to say, "As long as there is a breath, the car must be driven to the destination!" He let the officer hug him, and he himself lay on the steering wheel with both arms, driving the car for another half hour with serious injuries, finally ensuring that the car and the 37 comrades on it safely reached the designated location. When the comrades told him that his mission had been successfully completed, Zhang Zhen fainted on the steering wheel, and the seat, cushion, and floor were stained with pools of bright red blood.

In this test of blood and fire, the officers and Party members led by example, playing a pivotal role. When the troops were besieged, the officers and Party members stood at the outermost layer of the formation, protecting the soldiers' safety and preventing the troops from being dispersed; during the troops' advance, the officers and Party members stood in the first row and sat in the first car, organizing the troops to bravely advance; when executing difficult tasks, the officers and Party members rushed to the most difficult and dangerous places. The deputy division commander Tong Xigang of a certain division and the deputy commander of the armored troops of a certain unit, Shuo Shuangxi, led the armored car team to Tiananmen Square. Due to the obstruction of the following vehicles, they bravely advanced alone and arrived at the square first, having a shocking effect on the rioters. When they turned the car around to receive the following troops, the armored car stalled, and the rioters swarmed over, smashing the car and setting it on fire. The two leaders got off the car one after another, propagated to the masses, exposed the rioters, and were brutally beaten, sustaining serious injuries.

In the struggle to quell the riot, because the officers were at the forefront, and the rioters mainly targeted "officers," many leading cadres were injured, and some high-ranking cadres and generals were also injured. This situation was rare even on the battlefield in the past. The deputy political commissar Zhang Kan of a certain unit, who was 57 years old and had served in the military for 40 years, led a regiment on foot to Tiananmen Square. At that time, the regiment's leaders considered that he was relatively old and the distance was far, and advised him to stay behind. He refused to do so. He wore a steel helmet and rubber boots, leading the troops to march for more than two hours, breaking through 21 obstacles. During the march, he timely organized the officers and soldiers to propagate to the masses, encouraging everyone to display brave and tenacious spirits and quickly reach the designated location. Along the way, his two shoes were kicked off, and his soles were pierced by broken glass, and his toes were trampled into a mess of flesh and blood. Later, he was hit by a stone thrown by a rioter and seriously injured, with his left leg broken, and he fell to the ground. The rioters kicked and trampled on him, and some even stood on his body and kicked and trampled fiercely. He fainted at that moment and was fortunate to be rescued by a female worker who carried him to the emergency center. His three ribs were broken, his head was injured, and his kidneys and soft tissues were severely damaged, with more than 10 external injuries. This old soldier had participated in the suppression of bandits in Xiangxi and the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, and on the battlefield filled with gunfire, he had won merits but had never been injured. However, in this suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, under his command of more than ten thousand armed officers and soldiers, he was seriously injured. This was ironclad evidence of the rioters' crazy rampage and a miniature of the officers and Party members of our army, who were willing to shed blood and sacrifice themselves to defend the peace of the republic.

IV. In the midst of the bustling city, facing various difficulties, the broad masses of officers and soldiers worked hard and were disciplined, displaying the spirit of a civilized and powerful army.

After clearing Tiananmen Square and achieving initial success in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, the situation in Beijing remained tense for a few days. Some rioters still burned military vehicles and occasionally shot at the troops and the masses. The city's traffic was paralyzed, roads were blocked, and supplies from the government and some units to the troops were difficult to deliver to Tiananmen Square, causing great difficulties for the troops' logistics. At that time, from generals to soldiers, they endured hunger and thirst every day, eating compressed biscuits and instant noodles to fill their stomachs, and drinking tap water when thirsty. Some units did not eat hot food until June 11. In those most difficult days, the troops endured hunger and thirst without violating discipline, endured wind and rain without disturbing the people. Everyone shared food and water, officers let the soldiers, Party members let the masses, headquarters let the companies, and logistics personnel let the combat personnel. A certain battalion had eight people sharing one bread, and the communication personnel thought of the battalion's leaders who were very tired and could not bear to let them go hungry, secretly keeping two breads. The battalion commander and political instructor found out and insisted on giving the two breads to the injured comrades, eating only a handful of bread crumbs left over. A certain company lined up at the Great Hall of the People to get two buckets of water, which was only enough for each class to make a bag of instant noodles. After boiling, the whole class passed it around, and no one dared to eat. It was under such difficult conditions that no one violated the discipline of the masses. A unit on duty near the square had not had water for a day and a night. Next to their post, there was a stall selling individual food items with a large pile of soda outside. Due to the disturbance of the rioters, the owner closed the door and locked it. He saw from the window that the PLA was disciplined and was moved, voluntarily opening the soda for the soldiers to drink, but was politely declined. After negotiation, it was sold to the troops, and the thirsty soldiers drank dozens of boxes of soda in one go.

Those days, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers camped out on the square and the surrounding streets. In early June, Beijing had a large temperature difference between day and night, and it also rained continuously. The officers and soldiers had nowhere to hide, often huddling together for warmth, drying their clothes with body heat. Due to the obstruction or burning of the vehicles transporting their bedding, many officers and soldiers had no bedding, and at night they could only use their steel helmets as pillows, lying on the cold and damp cement floor in their uniforms. This scene was very similar to the scene of the PLA camping out on the streets of Shanghai 40 years ago. An old worker saw this scene and was moved to tears. Beijing is an ancient civilized city. After quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, due to the needs of the mission, some troops temporarily stayed in the Zhongshan Park, the Workers' Cultural Palace, and the Temple of Heaven, which are groups of ancient buildings. They formulated disciplines such as "ten do nots" according to the park's management regulations to protect cultural relics. To prevent the ancient buildings from being damaged, the troops slept on the long corridors or pitched tents in empty spaces to live. To reduce the risk of fire, the troops designated no-smoking areas, and smoking comrades voluntarily controlled the number of cigarettes they smoked; some units did not cook for several days, eating dry rations to fill their stomachs, and persisted until they withdrew.

The PLA's strict discipline of not taking a single needle comes from their unlimited loyalty and love for the people. From the beginning of receiving the mission, the martial law troops loudly proposed the slogan of "love the capital, love the people of the capital, love the young students" and put it into action from beginning to end. After achieving initial success in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, the officers and soldiers, without even having time to rest and clean their clothes, immediately went out to the streets, clearing obstacles, cleaning up garbage, sweeping the streets, and assisting relevant departments in restoring traffic. They sent vehicles and personnel to transport grain, vegetables, and liquid gas cylinders, which are essential items for the lives of citizens. On the construction sites of national key projects such as the Asian Games venues, the officers and soldiers used their hard work to add bricks and tiles to the construction of the capital.

The army loves the people, and the people love the army. In more than two months, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the martial law troops personally felt the care of the Party and the government, and the masses for the soldiers. Whether they were cadres, masses, or young students, whether they were elderly people with white hair or young pioneers with red scarves, they all expressed their deep affection for the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops in various ways and provided strong support from all aspects to complete the martial law mission. Beijing and various places across the country sent more than 1,300 batches of delegations to the martial law troops, sending more than 200,000 letters and telegrams of condolences. Many units and individuals also sent a large number of condolence items and some donations. The facts eloquently prove that quelling the counter-revolutionary riot is a just struggle, which has gained the support of the broad masses of the people; the People's Liberation Army is forever the people's army, and it has gained the sincere support of the broad masses of the people!

The spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" displayed by the capital's martial law troops is a specific manifestation of the broad masses of officers and soldiers firmly implementing the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Military Commission. It is a continuation of the shining spirits of Jian'gang Mountain, the Long March, Yan'an, Lei Feng, and Mount Lu, which have been passed down in the history of our army. This spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" is both a comprehensive development and inheritance of the excellent traditions of the people's army over the past 60 years and a concentrated embodiment of the essential characteristics and ideological sentiments of the new era's army. This spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" has added new luster to the excellent traditions of our army and has written a new chapter in the glorious history of our army.
