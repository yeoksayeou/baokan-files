In the special struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the soldiers of the martial law troops used their loyalty and blood to create and carry forward the inspiring spirit of "Guardians of the Republic." This spirit is mainly manifested in the following aspects: a clear and firm stance and belief in defending the Party, the country, and the people; a high spirit of self-sacrifice, bearing humiliation and bravely sacrificing oneself to awaken the people; a brave and tenacious revolutionary heroism, fighting relentlessly and fearlessly; and a hardworking and disciplined spirit, loving the people and being the people's army.

I. At the critical moment of the Party and the country's life and death, the broad masses of officers and soldiers unshakably executed the orders of the Central Committee of the Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, demonstrating a high level of political awareness and a firm political stance.

After mid-April, a small number of people planned a student movement that quickly developed into an organized, planned, and premeditated political turmoil. To stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council decided to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing. Upon receiving the order, the troops heading to Beijing immediately set out, traveling day and night to reach the capital. Many units received the order one day and set out the same day, mobilizing and moving out while still in formation. Some units gathered from within a radius of hundreds of miles, with soldiers carrying dirt and sweat from training grounds and construction sites, hastily setting out on their journey. Some returned from duty points and production sites, got off the trucks and onto the trains without even entering the barracks.

The emergency mobilization was like an exam, testing each officer and soldier's loyalty to the Party and tempering the soldiers' belief that "the interests of the motherland are above everything, and everything is sacrificed for the motherland." Some had just received a telegram about a critically ill family member, some had wives and children visiting the unit, some had just been approved for leave to visit home, and some had just received their marriage certificates and were preparing to be grooms. However, for the call of the republic, many comrades deeply cherished their emotions and resolutely set out. The deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, martyr Ma Guoxuan, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," had his fiancée come to the unit the day before he set out to Beijing, preparing for their wedding. The leader wanted him to stay, but he declined the leader's concern and resolutely set out with the unit to the capital. As they advanced towards Tiananmen Square, he told his platoon, "Now is the time of national crisis, the Party is in crisis. No matter how great the difficulties, we can only move forward, not retreat. As long as we have a breath, we will crawl to Tiananmen." He practiced his oath with loyalty and blood. He did not get to marry his beloved, but the People's Republic will forever remember his immortal merits.

A small number of people, for counter-revolutionary political needs, leaked the secret two days before the martial law was announced, allowing the illegal organization "High Autonomous Federation" to preemptively announce the end of the hunger strike at the capital's party, government, and military cadres' meeting on the evening of May 19. At the same time, they planned and incited the masses to block the martial law troops. They infiltrated the streets and alleys and residential areas, distorting right and wrong, deceiving the masses, shouting things like "The PLA is entering the city, tanks are coming to Tiananmen to crush the students," and even feigning pitifully, "Uncles and aunts, the PLA is imposing martial law on Beijing, suppressing the students," and so on. Many uninformed masses went out to the streets under such circumstances. The "High Autonomous Federation" gang, to achieve their evil goal of stopping the implementation of martial law, used various counter-revolutionary tricks against the martial law troops: first, blocking and besieging. They set up heavy barriers at the main roads where the troops were advancing, let the air out of the military vehicles' tires, and did not allow them to move forward. At the same time, they surrounded the military vehicles, not allowing the troops to get off the vehicles, eat, drink, or sleep for days and nights, attempting to wear down the troops. Second, spreading rumors and slandering. They wrote slogans on the military vehicles, threw reactionary leaflets into the vehicles, and gave reactionary speeches. Third, attempting to split and subvert.

Facing these blockades, ridicule, insults, beatings, and attempts to split and subvert, the troops were caught off guard. They repeatedly studied the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party and the Central Military Commission on the vehicles that were besieged, calmly analyzing the harm that the turmoil brought to the Party and the country. The officers and soldiers became even more vigilant and firm in their beliefs: those who planned and organized the turmoil were absolutely not engaged in some "patriotic" and "democratic" movement; their speeches and actions were aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and subverting the People's Republic of China. The officers and soldiers firmly believed in the correctness of the Central Committee's decision, and they executed the martial law mission, fulfilling their duty to defend the Party, the country, and the people, with righteousness and honor.

More than 1,000 officers and soldiers of a certain unit were blocked at Shanhao Station in the suburbs of Beijing. The "High Autonomous Federation" incited more than 10 schools to propagate against martial law to the troops. For two whole days and nights, the troops endured hunger and thirst, singing songs like "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" to uphold justice, marching in formation to display military discipline, helping to clean the station and wash the vehicles. At the same time, they sent batches of officers and soldiers to the masses and students to propagate the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party and the necessity of martial law. The troop leaders also invited the students for a discussion, saying, "You keep talking about democracy and freedom, but now you don't let the soldiers eat, drink, or rest, not even giving them the basic human freedom. What kind of democracy and freedom are you talking about?" The students were speechless, and many left in shame, saying truthfully, "Now we believe in the PLA. It was the 'High Autonomous Federation' that arranged for us to come, and we will be punished if we fail to complete the task." In another area, the troops were besieged for three days and nights without getting off the vehicles. The troops were extremely tired, but the officers and soldiers had no complaints. The firm attitude of the officers and soldiers foiled the evil plot of a small number of people to split and subvert the martial law troops.

II. Facing the complex situation where a few rioters and uninformed masses were mixed together, the broad masses of officers and soldiers bore humiliation and bravely sacrificed themselves, demonstrating a high spirit of self-sacrifice to awaken the people with blood.

On June 3, after the counter-revolutionary riot broke out, to quickly quell the riot, the martial law troops were ordered to forcefully advance into the city. The planners and organizers of the riot gathered a group of people who harbored deep hatred for the Communist Party and the socialist system, buying thugs and distributing wooden sticks with nails, knives, and a large number of stones, steel bars, Molotov cocktails, and other weapons on more than ten roads leading to the city. They brazenly blocked the military's advance, sometimes openly armed, crazily engaging in smashing, looting, arson, and killing, and sometimes coercing some people to act as shields, pushing many uninformed masses to the front line.

Such a sharp and complex situation was unprecedented in any military operation the PLA had conducted in the past few decades. Due to the presence of a few rioters among the masses, to avoid injuring the masses, many decisive measures of the martial law troops were difficult to implement. Otherwise, the armed PLA could not be stopped? Tanks and armored vehicles could not break through any obstacles? It was precisely to protect the masses that the troops endured humiliation, shed tears, and even sacrificed their lives. On the early morning of June 4, the soldier Zhou Guozheng of the Second Platoon of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," was blocked at Chongwenmen with his platoon. The car stalled when it turned around. The rioters swarmed over, set the car on fire, and 12 officers and soldiers got off the car to break out. Zhou Guozheng and his comrades were forced to retreat to the bridge. The rioters took the opportunity to attack, and Zhou Guozheng was brutally beaten. The rioters threw the unconscious Zhou Guozheng off the bridge and poured gasoline on him, burning him to death. A civilian snatched Zhou Guozheng's submachine gun, and the soldiers saw that the bullets given to Zhou Guozheng before departure were all pressed in the magazine, not missing a single one. Zhou Guozheng, with his spirit of sacrificing himself to save the masses, composed a new era's song of love for the people!

Blood is hard to come by, and bearing humiliation is not easy. Our young soldiers, whose personal dignity is not inferior to anyone else's, and whose lives are as valuable as anyone else's, but for the sake of protecting and educating the masses, for the sake of exposing the crimes of the rioters, and for the sake of seizing the political initiative, they took many measures of restraint. Some soldiers, to control their potentially explosive emotions, wrote a big "endure" on the shoulder bags they carried. The platoon leader You Degao of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," led his platoon to be besieged at the Muxiyuan Overpass. An over-50-year-old woman who did not understand the situation forced her way to the front of the formation, pointing at You Degao's nose and cursing, and spitting in his face. You Degao endured this unprecedented humiliation in his life, silently wiping away the spit, and did not retaliate. Suddenly, the restless crowd knocked the woman to the ground, and she was about to be trampled or killed. You Degao took a step forward, using his back to fiercely resist the surging crowd, and pulled the woman up. The woman was saved, walked away in shame, and You Degao's hand was skinned and bleeding. As they continued to advance, a rioter took advantage of his moment of inattention and swung an iron bar at his head, leaving a four to five-centimeter-long wound. To defend himself, he drew his gun, turned around to aim at the rioter only a few steps away, but seeing the many onlookers behind the rioter, he silently put the gun back. At that moment, a brick flew towards him, and his face was hit with a three-centimeter-long wound. Then, the rioter hit him on the waist with a stick. He fell to the ground, and sticks, steel bars, stones, and bricks rained down on him, leaving him severely injured and bloody. He fainted, and the ruthless rioters stripped off his clothes and continued to beat him. Later, fortunately, two police officers risked their lives to send him to the hospital. He had 17 injuries on his body, and 14 stitches on his head and face, leaving him with severe post-concussion syndrome. You Degao did not regret it when he woke up. He said, if his blood could awaken the masses' consciousness, it was worth it. This is the breadth of our soldiers, and this is the voice of our soldiers.

To quell the riot, the advancing troops, in a situation of unbearable and unavoidable circumstances, fired warning shots, and even at this time, the officers and soldiers still did their utmost to avoid injuring the masses. A certain regiment advanced from Liujia Bridge to Tiananmen Square. The vanguard was blocked at Guang'anmen Bridgehead. As the rioters shouted wildly, bricks and stones rained down, and many comrades were knocked down. The soldiers raised their blood-stained and tear-stained faces, wanting to fire back at the rioters, but seeing the dense crowd of onlookers, they endured and advanced quickly. When this regiment reached the designated location, from the regiment commander to the soldiers, 100% were beaten, and 85% were injured, including 149 seriously injured. Facing the flying bricks and stones, and the wildly swinging iron bars, facing the danger of injury and death, the troops restrained and yielded. Were the troops in the wrong? Absolutely not! The troops were righteous and honorable in restoring order in the capital. Were the troops cowardly? Even more not! Whether charging into battle or rescuing in disasters, our army has always been fearless and unyielding. In the past few decades, our army has defeated powerful enemies both domestically and internationally. Then, why this time? It was because they faced a special struggle. The more than ten martyrs who were awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic" all had guns in their hands and bullets in their guns, but they were all brutally killed by rioters in the midst of tens of thousands of uninformed masses who were besieging them, without firing a shot at the crowd. They used their young lives and bright red blood to show that our army is a people's army led by the Party, serving the people wholeheartedly. They showed a deeply moving page in the spirit of "Guardians of the Republic." In the entire process of quelling the riot, the martial law troops had more than 6,000 injured and dozens of martyrs, and more than 1,000 vehicles were destroyed. This high price is both ironclad evidence of the rioters' extreme ruthlessness and an immortal record of the people's army's restraint, self-sacrifice, and protection of the masses!

III. When the troops were fiercely attacked by counter-revolutionary rioters, the broad masses of officers and soldiers fearlessly and bravely fought, displaying a fearless revolutionary heroism.

The rioters knew that the day the martial law troops reached Tiananmen Square and other designated locations would be their day of doom. Therefore, they crazily blocked, besieged, and burned military vehicles, viciously snatched weapons and ammunition, brutally beat and kidnapped soldiers, and particularly shocking was that they poured gasoline on the bodies of soldiers who were brutally killed, set them on fire, and left them to rot in the streets, a gruesome sight.

When the troops were seriously obstructed and faced heavy difficulties on their way forward, the officers and soldiers bravely advanced, breaking through obstacles. The vanguard troops advancing from the western suburbs of Beijing to Tiananmen Square were tasked with opening the way for the following troops and clearing the square. At that time, the ten-mile Chang'an Street was filled with rioters spreading rumors and inciting chaos, and many uninformed masses blocked the streets. The main roads were filled with layer upon layer of obstacles, causing great difficulties for the troops' advance. The leaders at all levels ordered the troops to get off the vehicles. They formed teams on both sides of the vehicles, protecting the vehicles with people, moving with the vehicles, and looking out for each other. The officers and soldiers sang heroic military songs and shouted loud slogans, advancing forward one after another. When the troops reached Fuxingmen, the rioters had already placed public buses, trucks, and trailers in the middle of the road and set them on fire. Immediately, thick smoke billowed, and flames roared, scorching people so they couldn't get close. The officers and soldiers, disregarding their lives, rushed towards the cars that could explode at any moment, pushing them with their hands, shoulders, and poles. Many people's clothes were on fire, and their hands, faces, and arms were burned, but they endured the pain and continued to fight, finally pushing the burning cars to the side of the road, ensuring the troops' continued advance. Especially the reconnaissance team of a certain unit, which was responsible for opening the way, walked 18 miles on foot, clearing obstacles. All 48 officers and soldiers were injured, but no one left the battlefield. When they passed by Zhongnanhai, they saw some rioters crazily attacking the guard soldiers and storming Zhongnanhai. This reconnaissance team, with their skilled capture and combat techniques, subdued the rioters and captured six ringleaders, resolving the crisis at Zhongnanhai. Later, they continued to advance, and after more than five hours of hard fighting, they finally reached the designated location. The reconnaissance company of a certain unit, which was awarded the title of "Vanguard Company of Crossing the River" in the war years, received the task of destroying the command center of the illegal organization "High Autonomous Federation" on Tiananmen Square at dawn on June 4. Although the entire company had not eaten or slept for a day and a night, their fighting spirit was very high. With the cooperation of brother companies, they destroyed the "High Autonomous Federation" command center in just 30 minutes. The entire operation was swift, decisive, neat, and secure, making a special contribution to the smooth clearing of the square. The troops that arrived at the square one after another divided into groups, continuously fought, and foiled the rioters' attempt to burn down the Tiananmen City Gate with Molotov cocktails and gasoline bombs. They blocked the rioters who tried to rush into the square again at various entrances and exits. In the situation where the students who were stranded in the square were peacefully evacuated, they quickly completed the clearing task, ending the situation where the square was occupied by illegal organizations and counter-revolutionary rioters, and returning it to the people.

Many officers and soldiers, even when seriously injured and facing the threat of death, still fearlessly and bravely fought, risking their lives to quickly reach the designated location, to rescue weapons, save comrades, and protect the masses. The platoon leader Liu Guobing of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," drove a car through the rioters' fierce attacks, bypassed the obstacles, and broke through the siege. When he reached the north side of the Great Hall of the People, he had already been injured in two places. He heard that there were still three cars, 82 comrades, and a batch of guns, ammunition, and radios behind him that needed to be rescued, so he volunteered and fearlessly rushed back. When he was beaten by the rioters, he bravely broke through the siege and, without hesitation, rescued the comrades and weapons behind him. After being seriously injured, the rioters poured gasoline on his body and set him on fire. He bravely rushed towards the rioters, determined to perish with them. Liu Guobing, with his young life, composed a heroic song of sacrificing his life to save others and leaving the danger to himself. The driver Zhang Zhen of a certain unit, who was awarded the title of "Guardian of the Republic," was driving a car on the night of June 3 and was suddenly attacked by a group of rioters at the Yongding Road intersection. The four windshields of the driver's cab were smashed, and his head was hit with a five-centimeter-long wound, and his skull was injured, with blood flowing down. The officer in charge of the car bandaged him with an emergency kit, but the bleeding still did not stop. He took a few painkillers, rallied his spirits, and continued to drive. Due to excessive bleeding, he was dizzy and in severe pain, so he drank a sip of water after driving a short distance, and with one step and a drop of blood, he persisted for five hours. When the car reached the Xidan intersection, it was again attacked by rioters with firearms. Zhang Zhen was injured in 11 places on his chest and shoulders. The officer next to him asked if he could still hold on, and he struggled to say, "As long as there is a breath, the car must be driven to the destination!" He let the officer hug him, and he himself lay on the steering wheel with both arms, driving the car for another half hour with serious injuries, finally ensuring that the car and the 37 comrades on it safely reached the designated location. When the comrades told him that his mission had been successfully completed, Zhang Zhen fainted on the steering wheel, and the seat, cushion, and floor were stained with pools of bright red blood.

In this test of blood and fire, the officers and Party members led by example, playing a pivotal role. When the troops were besieged, the officers and Party members stood at the outermost layer of the formation, protecting the soldiers' safety and preventing the troops from being dispersed; during the troops' advance, the officers and Party members stood in the first row and sat in the first car, organizing the troops to bravely advance; when executing difficult tasks, the officers and Party members rushed to the most difficult and dangerous places. The deputy division commander Tong Xigang of a certain division and the deputy commander of the armored troops of a certain unit, Shuo Shuangxi, led the armored car team to Tiananmen Square. Due to the obstruction of the following vehicles, they bravely advanced alone and arrived at the square first, having a shocking effect on the rioters. When they turned the car around to receive the following troops, the armored car stalled, and the rioters swarmed over, smashing the car and setting it on fire. The two leaders got off the car one after another, propagated to the masses, exposed the rioters, and were brutally beaten, sustaining serious injuries.

In the struggle to quell the riot, because the officers were at the forefront, and the rioters mainly targeted "officers," many leading cadres were injured, and some high-ranking cadres and generals were also injured. This situation was rare even on the battlefield in the past. The deputy political commissar Zhang Kan of a certain unit, who was 57 years old and had served in the military for 40 years, led a regiment on foot to Tiananmen Square. At that time, the regiment's leaders considered that he was relatively old and the distance was far, and advised him to stay behind. He refused to do so. He wore a steel helmet and rubber boots, leading the troops to march for more than two hours, breaking through 21 obstacles. During the march, he timely organized the officers and soldiers to propagate to the masses, encouraging everyone to display brave and tenacious spirits and quickly reach the designated location. Along the way, his two shoes were kicked off, and his soles were pierced by broken glass, and his toes were trampled into a mess of flesh and blood. Later, he was hit by a stone thrown by a rioter and seriously injured, with his left leg broken, and he fell to the ground. The rioters kicked and trampled on him, and some even stood on his body and kicked and trampled fiercely. He fainted at that moment and was fortunate to be rescued by a female worker who carried him to the emergency center. His three ribs were broken, his head was injured, and his kidneys and soft tissues were severely damaged, with more than 10 external injuries. This old soldier had participated in the suppression of bandits in Xiangxi and the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, and on the battlefield filled with gunfire, he had won merits but had never been injured. However, in this suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, under his command of more than ten thousand armed officers and soldiers, he was seriously injured. This was ironclad evidence of the rioters' crazy rampage and a miniature of the officers and Party members of our army, who were willing to shed blood and sacrifice themselves to defend the peace of the republic.

IV. In the midst of the bustling city, facing various difficulties, the broad masses of officers and soldiers worked hard and were disciplined, displaying the spirit of a civilized and powerful army.

After clearing Tiananmen Square and achieving initial success in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, the situation in Beijing remained tense for a few days. Some rioters still burned military vehicles and occasionally shot at the troops and the masses. The city's traffic was paralyzed, roads were blocked, and supplies from the government and some units to the troops were difficult to deliver to Tiananmen Square, causing great difficulties for the troops' logistics. At that time, from generals to soldiers, they endured hunger and thirst every day, eating compressed biscuits and instant noodles to fill their stomachs, and drinking tap water when thirsty. Some units did not eat hot food until June 11. In those most difficult days, the troops endured hunger and thirst without violating discipline, endured wind and rain without disturbing the people. Everyone shared food and water, officers let the soldiers, Party members let the masses, headquarters let the companies, and logistics personnel let the combat personnel. A certain battalion had eight people sharing one bread, and the communication personnel thought of the battalion's leaders who were very tired and could not bear to let them go hungry, secretly keeping two breads. The battalion commander and political instructor found out and insisted on giving the two breads to the injured comrades, eating only a handful of bread crumbs left over. A certain company lined up at the Great Hall of the People to get two buckets of water, which was only enough for each class to make a bag of instant noodles. After boiling, the whole class passed it around, and no one dared to eat. It was under such difficult conditions that no one violated the discipline of the masses. A unit on duty near the square had not had water for a day and a night. Next to their post, there was a stall selling individual food items with a large pile of soda outside. Due to the disturbance of the rioters, the owner closed the door and locked it. He saw from the window that the PLA was disciplined and was moved, voluntarily opening the soda for the soldiers to drink, but was politely declined. After negotiation, it was sold to the troops, and the thirsty soldiers drank dozens of boxes of soda in one go.

Those days, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers camped out on the square and the surrounding streets. In early June, Beijing had a large temperature difference between day and night, and it also rained continuously. The officers and soldiers had nowhere to hide, often huddling together for warmth, drying their clothes with body heat. Due to the obstruction or burning of the vehicles transporting their bedding, many officers and soldiers had no bedding, and at night they could only use their steel helmets as pillows, lying on the cold and damp cement floor in their uniforms. This scene was very similar to the scene of the PLA camping out on the streets of Shanghai 40 years ago. An old worker saw this scene and was moved to tears. Beijing is an ancient civilized city. After quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, due to the needs of the mission, some troops temporarily stayed in the Zhongshan Park, the Workers' Cultural Palace, and the Temple of Heaven, which are groups of ancient buildings. They formulated disciplines such as "ten do nots" according to the park's management regulations to protect cultural relics. To prevent the ancient buildings from being damaged, the troops slept on the long corridors or pitched tents in empty spaces to live. To reduce the risk of fire, the troops designated no-smoking areas, and smoking comrades voluntarily controlled the number of cigarettes they smoked; some units did not cook for several days, eating dry rations to fill their stomachs, and persisted until they withdrew.

The PLA's strict discipline of not taking a single needle comes from their unlimited loyalty and love for the people. From the beginning of receiving the mission, the martial law troops loudly proposed the slogan of "love the capital, love the people of the capital, love the young students" and put it into action from beginning to end. After achieving initial success in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, the officers and soldiers, without even having time to rest and clean their clothes, immediately went out to the streets, clearing obstacles, cleaning up garbage, sweeping the streets, and assisting relevant departments in restoring traffic. They sent vehicles and personnel to transport grain, vegetables, and liquid gas cylinders, which are essential items for the lives of citizens. On the construction sites of national key projects such as the Asian Games venues, the officers and soldiers used their hard work to add bricks and tiles to the construction of the capital.

The army loves the people, and the people love the army. In more than two months, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the martial law troops personally felt the care of the Party and the government, and the masses for the soldiers. Whether they were cadres, masses, or young students, whether they were elderly people with white hair or young pioneers with red scarves, they all expressed their deep affection for the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops in various ways and provided strong support from all aspects to complete the martial law mission. Beijing and various places across the country sent more than 1,300 batches of delegations to the martial law troops, sending more than 200,000 letters and telegrams of condolences. Many units and individuals also sent a large number of condolence items and some donations. The facts eloquently prove that quelling the counter-revolutionary riot is a just struggle, which has gained the support of the broad masses of the people; the People's Liberation Army is forever the people's army, and it has gained the sincere support of the broad masses of the people!

The spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" displayed by the capital's martial law troops is a specific manifestation of the broad masses of officers and soldiers firmly implementing the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Military Commission. It is a continuation of the shining spirits of Jian'gang Mountain, the Long March, Yan'an, Lei Feng, and Mount Lu, which have been passed down in the history of our army. This spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" is both a comprehensive development and inheritance of the excellent traditions of the people's army over the past 60 years and a concentrated embodiment of the essential characteristics and ideological sentiments of the new era's army. This spirit of "Guardians of the Republic" has added new luster to the excellent traditions of our army and has written a new chapter in the glorious history of our army.

    “共和国卫士”精神永放光彩
    ——首都戒严部队制止动乱、平息暴乱英模事迹报告提纲摘要
    在制止动乱、平息北京发生的反革命暴乱这场特殊斗争中，戒严部队广大干部战士用自己的忠诚和热血，创造和弘扬了可歌可泣的“共和国卫士”精神。这种精神主要表现在：誓死保卫党、保卫祖国、保卫人民的鲜明立场和坚定信念；忍辱负重、慷慨赴死，以血醒民的高度自我牺牲精神；勇猛顽强、连续奋战，一往无前的革命英雄主义气概；艰苦奋斗、秋毫无犯，无限热爱人民的子弟兵本色。
    一、在党和国家生死存亡的危急关头，广大官兵毫不动摇地执行党中央、国务院、中央军委的命令，表现了高度的政治觉悟和坚定的政治立场
    4月中旬以后，极少数人策划的学潮，迅速发展为一场有组织、有计划、有预谋的政治动乱。为了制止动乱、稳定局势，党中央、国务院决定在北京市部分地区实行戒严。赴京执行戒严任务的部队接到命令后，立即出发，昼夜兼程开赴北京。许多部队当天接到命令，当天紧急出动，边收拢、边动员、边开进。有的部队从方圆几百里内紧急集合，干部战士带着训练场、施工点上的泥土和汗水，匆匆踏上路程。有的从执勤点、生产地返回，下了汽车就上火车，连营房都没有进。
    紧急出动就像考场，检验着每个干部战士对党的忠诚，也锤炼着军人“祖国的利益高于一切，为了祖国舍得一切”的崇高思想。有的刚刚接到亲人病危的电报，有的妻子儿女刚到部队探亲，有的刚刚被批准休假探家，有的刚领了结婚证准备当新郎，然而为了共和国的召唤，许多同志深深地珍藏了自己的感情，毅然决然地上路了。被授予“共和国卫士”称号的某部代理排长、烈士马国选，在赴京前一天，未婚妻来队，准备结婚，领导要他留下，但他谢绝了领导的关心，毅然随部队奔赴首都。在向天安门广场开进时，他对全排同志说：“现在是国难当头，党难当头，再大的困难，只能前进，不能后退，只要还有一口气，爬也要爬到天安门。”他用忠贞和热血实践了自己的誓言，他没能与自己的心上人结婚，但是人民共和国将永远记住他不朽的功勋。
    极少数的人出于反革命的政治需要，在宣布戒严令的前两天，就把这个机密泄漏出去，使非法组织“高自联”抢先在19日晚首都党政军干部大会召开前宣布停止绝食，同时策划和煽动群众堵截戒严部队。他们窜入大街小巷和居民院落，颠倒黑白，蒙蔽群众，叫喊什么“解放军要进城，大批坦克要到天安门碾压学生”，甚至假作可怜巴巴的说：“伯伯叔叔们，解放军要对北京实行军管，镇压学生啦”，等等。许多不明真相的群众就是在这种情况下上街的。“高自联”一伙为了达到阻止戒严令实施的罪恶目的，对戒严部队施展了种种反革命伎俩：一是堵截围困。他们在部队前进的主要路口设置了重重路障，把军车的轮胎放了气，不许前进。同时围住一辆辆军车，几天几夜不让部队下车，不让吃饭、喝水、睡觉，企图把部队拖垮。二是造谣诬蔑。他们在军车上刷标语，把反动传单扔进车内，进行反动演讲。三是拉拢策反。
    面对这些围阻堵截、讽刺挖苦谩骂殴打、拉拢策反，部队官兵始料不及。他们在被围堵的军车上反复学习党中央、中央军委的指示，冷静地分析着动乱给党和国家带来的危害。干部战士更加擦亮了眼睛，坚定了信念：那些动乱的策划者和组织者，绝不是在搞什么“爱国”、“民主”运动，他们的言论和行动是要推翻共产党的领导，颠覆中华人民共和国。干部战士坚信党中央的决策英明正确，我们执行戒严任务，履行保卫党、保卫祖国、保卫人民的义务，理直气壮，义不容辞，无尚光荣。戒严部队官兵始终保持了旺盛的斗志，对一些人的煽动性演讲，大都以沉默的方式表示嗤之以鼻；对一些荒谬离奇的谎言，据事论理加以戳穿；对极少数人恶毒攻击诬蔑党和国家领导人的反动宣传，则针锋相对、义正辞严地予以驳斥。广大指战员在一小撮坏人的种种伎俩面前，表现了坚定的政治立场。
    某部1000多名官兵被堵在京郊沙河车站，“高自联”煽动组织了10多所院校的学生向部队进行反戒严的宣传。整整两天两夜，部队官兵忍饥挨饿，高唱《没有共产党就没有新中国》等歌曲，用歌声伸张正义，到站台上走正步展现军容，帮助车站打扫卫生，清洗车辆。同时派出大批干部战士到群众和学生中去，宣传党中央的指示，宣传戒严的必要性。部队领导还把学生请来座谈，对他们说：“你们口口声声要民主，要自由，可眼下你们不让军人吃饭、喝水、休息，连军人起码的人身自由都不给，你们要的是什么民主、什么自由呢？”学生们哑口无言，许多人惭愧地走了，临走时说了真话：现在我们相信解放军了，是“高自联”布置我们来的，完不成任务要受处罚。在六里桥和另一个地区被围困的部队，三天三夜下不了车，部队极度疲劳，干部战士毫无怨言。官兵们的坚定态度，使极少数人妄图分化瓦解戒严部队的阴谋遭到了彻底的失败。
    二、面对少数暴徒和不明真相群众混在一起的复杂情况，广大官兵忍辱负重，慷慨赴死，表现了以血醒民的高度自我牺牲精神
    6月3日，反革命暴乱发生后，为了迅速平息暴乱，戒严部队奉命向市区强行开进。暴乱的策划者和组织者，纠集了一伙对共产党和社会主义制度有刻骨仇恨的人，收买流氓地痞，并且分发了带钉的木棍、菜刀，准备了大量的石块、钢筋、燃烧瓶等凶器，在通往市区的十几条公路上，肆无忌惮地阻拦军队开进。他们时而明火执仗，疯狂地进行打砸抢烧杀，时而裹胁一些人在前面作掩护，把许多不明真相的群众推到第一线。
    如此尖锐复杂的情况，是我军几十年来进行任何一次军事行动所不曾遇到过的。由于少数暴徒混在群众中间，为了避免误伤群众，戒严部队许多断然措施难以出手。不然的话，荷枪实弹的解放军谁能阻挡住？坦克、装甲车哪有突不破的障碍？正是为了保护群众，部队官兵忍受着屈辱，流着泪，淌着血，甚至牺牲了生命。6月4日凌晨，被授予“共和国卫士”称号的某部二连战士崔国政，随连队乘车在崇文门受阻，车掉头时熄火。暴徒们蜂拥而上，汽车被点燃，12名干部战士下车突围，崔国政等同志被迫撤到天桥上。暴徒乘机而上，崔国政惨遭毒打。暴徒把昏厥中的崔国政扔下天桥，又向他身上泼洒汽油，他被活活烧死。一名群众抢回了崔国政的冲锋枪，战士们看到，出发前发给崔国政的子弹都压在弹夹里，一颗不少。崔国政以宁亡自己、不伤群众的牺牲精神，谱写了一曲新时期爱民的壮歌！
    流血不易，忍辱也不易。我们的年轻战士，人格不比任何人低，生命价值不比任何人轻，但为了保护和教育群众，为了揭露暴徒的罪行，为了争取政治上的主动，他们采取了许多忍耐的措施。一些战士为了控制自己有可能爆发出的激愤情绪，在随身携带的挎包上写下了一个大大的“忍”字。被授予“共和国卫士”称号的某部排长游德高，率领全排在木樨园立交桥遭到围困。一个50多岁不明真相的妇女硬挤到队伍面前，指着游德高的鼻子谩骂，并朝他的脸上吐唾沫。游德高忍受着这有生以来从未受过的莫大污辱，默默地擦去唾沫，没有还口。突然，骚动的人群把这个妇女挤倒在地上，眼看要把这个妇女踩伤或踩死，游德高一个箭步冲上去，用后背拚命顶住涌上来的人群，伸手把这个妇女拉了起来，这个妇女得救了，羞愧地走了，游德高的手被踩掉了皮，渗出了血。在继续行进时，一个暴徒趁他不备，抡起铁棒朝他头部猛打过来，他后脑勺被打出一条四五厘米长的口子。为了自卫，他拔出手枪，转身对准只有几步远的暴徒，但看到暴徒身后的许多围观群众，就又默默收回了枪。这时，迎面飞来一块砖头，他的脸被砸出3厘米长的血口子。接着，暴徒又对着游德高腰上打了一棒，他倒下后，木棒、钢筋条、石头、砖块劈头盖脑向他打来，他遍体鳞伤，血肉模糊，昏死过去，残忍的暴徒又扒光了他的衣服，继续毒打。后来，多亏两名警察冒死将他送进了医院。他身上17处负伤，仅头上和脸上就缝了14针，留下严重的脑震荡后遗症。游德高醒来没有后悔，他说，如果自己的一点血能唤醒群众的觉悟，是值得的。这就是我们子弟兵的胸襟，这就是我们子弟兵的心声。
    为平息暴乱，开进部队在忍无可忍、迫不得已的情况下鸣枪示警，即使在这时，官兵们仍然尽最大努力避免误伤群众。某团从六里桥向天安门广场开进，先头部队冲向广安门桥头时，随着暴徒们的阵阵狂叫，砖石倾泻而来，许多同志被砸倒。战士们抬起血泪交流的脸，恨不得开枪还击暴徒，但看到黑压压的围观人群，他们顽强忍耐，快速前进。这个团到达指定地点时，上自团长下至战士，100％挨打，85％受了伤，其中重伤149人。面对砖石齐飞，铁棍乱扫，面对伤亡的危险，部队克制忍让，是部队理屈吗？绝对不是！部队是理直气壮地为着恢复首都秩序而来的。是部队胆怯吗？更不是！无论冲锋杀敌还是抢险救灾，我们的军队从来都是毫不畏惧、一往无前的。在过去几十年里，我军曾打败过国内外的强大敌人。那么，这次又是为了什么？就是因为他们面对的是一场特殊的斗争。被授予“共和国卫士”称号的十几位烈士，他们在牺牲前，手中都有枪，枪里都有子弹，但他们都是在成千上万不明真相群众的围堵中，在没有向人群开枪的情况下，遭到暴徒残酷杀害的。他们用年轻的生命，殷红的鲜血，昭示了我们军队是党领导下的全心全意为人民服务的军队，昭示了“共和国卫士”精神中极为感人的一页。在整个平息暴乱中，戒严部队伤6000多人，牺牲数十人，被毁车辆1000多台，这高昂的代价既是暴徒无比残忍的铁证，也是人民军队为保护人民群众而克制忍让、无私献身的不朽记录！
    三、当部队遭到反革命暴徒的疯狂袭击时，广大官兵毫不畏惧，勇猛顽强，展现了一往无前的革命英雄主义气概
    暴乱分子深知，戒严部队到达天安门广场和其它指定位置之日，就是他们的灭亡之时。为此，他们疯狂地围阻、堵截、砸烧军车，穷凶极恶地抢夺武器弹药，残忍地殴打、绑架军人，特别令人发指的是，他们在遭残害至死的军人遗体上浇汽油，纵火焚烧，暴尸街头，惨不忍睹。
    在部队严重受阻，前进道路上遇到重重困难时，干部战士勇往直前，闯关破障。从京西地区向天安门广场开进的先头部队，担负着为后续部队开路并到天安门广场清场的艰巨任务。当时，十里长安街上，暴乱分子四处造谣煽动，并在各个路口猖狂肆虐，许多不明真相的群众阻塞街头，主要路口布满了层层路障，给部队的开进造成极大困难。各级领导指挥部队下车。在车辆两侧结队，以人护车，车随人行，首尾相顾，整体开进，干部战士高唱着雄壮的军歌，呼喊着嘹亮口号，前仆后继地向前挺进。部队行至复兴门，暴徒们把早已横在马路中间的公共汽车、卡车、拖车浇上汽油，放火焚烧。顿时，浓烟滚滚，烈焰腾腾，炙烤得人们不能靠近。干部战士置生死于不顾，争先恐后扑向随时都可能爆炸的汽车，用手推，用肩顶，用棍撬，许多人的衣服被烧着，手、脸、胳膊被烧伤，忍着伤疼坚持战斗，终于把一辆辆燃烧的汽车推到路边，保证了部队的继续开进。特别是担负开路先锋的某部侦察分队，边排障，步行18里，48名官兵人人受伤，无一人下火线。他们途经新华门时，看到一些暴徒疯狂地残害警卫战士，冲击中南海。这个侦察分队以娴熟的擒拿格斗技术，制服暴徒，抓获了6名为首分子，解除了新华门前的危机。尔后，他们又继续开进，经过5个多小时的艰苦奋战，终于胜利到达指定位置。在战争年代曾荣获“渡江侦察先遣连”称号的某部侦察一连，于6月4日凌晨接受了捣毁盘踞在天安门广场的非法组织“高自联”指挥部的任务。全连官兵尽管一天一夜没吃没睡，但战斗情绪非常高昂，在兄弟连队配合下，仅用30分钟就捣毁了“高自联”的指挥部，整个行动迅速、坚决、利索、稳妥，为顺利清场作出了特殊贡献。先后到达广场的各部队分兵把口，连续战斗，粉碎了暴徒用燃烧瓶、汽油瓶烧毁天安门城楼的企图，阻挡了各个路口妄想再次冲进广场的暴徒，在滞留广场的学生和平撤离的情况下，迅速完成了清场任务，使天安门广场结束了被非法组织、反革命暴徒盘踞的局面，重新回到了人民的手中。
    许多干部战士在身负重伤、面对死亡的威胁时，仍然毫不畏惧，顽强奋战，为尽快到达指定位置，为抢救武器、营救战友、保护群众，赴汤蹈火，在所不辞。被授予“共和国卫士”称号的某部排长刘国庚，乘坐汽车顶着暴徒的疯狂袭击，绕开路障，冲出重围，到达人民大会堂北侧时，已两处负伤。他听说后面还有3台汽车、82名战友和一批枪支弹药、电台需要营救，又自告奋勇，义无反顾地冲了回去。在遭到暴徒殴打时，他奋力突围，不顾一切地接应后面的战友和武器装备。他身负重伤后，暴徒用汽油将他身体点燃，他毅然扑过去要与暴徒同归于尽。刘国庚为了保护战友和武器装备，用自己年轻的生命谱写了一曲把生的希望让给别人，把死的危险留给自己的壮烈凯歌。被授予“共和国卫士”称号的某部司机张震，在6月3日深夜驾车行驶到永定路口时，突然遭到一伙暴徒的袭击，驾驶室的4块挡风玻璃全被砸碎，他的头部被砸开一道5厘米长的口子，颅骨受伤，鲜血直淌。带车的干部用急救包给他包扎，但仍血流不止。他服下几片止痛药，振作精神，继续驾车前进，由于流血过多，头晕目眩，疼痛剧烈，他就走一段路喝一口水，一步一滴血地坚持了5个小时。车行至西单路口时，又遭到暴徒的火枪袭击，张震胸部和肩部受伤11处，身旁的干部问他还能否坚持，他吃力地说：“只要还有一口气，就要把车开到目的地！”他让干部抱着他，自己用两臂趴在方向盘上，带着重伤又坚持开车半小时，终于保证了这台车和车上37名同志安全到达了预定地点。当同志们告诉他，你的任务已胜利完成了，张震一下子昏倒在方向盘上，座位、靠垫和脚下留下一滩滩殷红的鲜血。
    在这场血与火的考验中，干部、党员身先士卒，模范带头，发挥了中流砥柱的作用。部队被围时，干部和党员站在队伍的最外层，保护战士的安全，保护部队不被冲散；在部队开进中，干部、党员站在第一排、坐在第一车，组织部队勇猛前进；在执行艰巨任务时，干部、党员哪里困难就往哪里冲，哪里危险就出现在哪里。某师副师长佟喜刚大校和某部装甲兵部副部长谢双喜大校，乘坐首车率装甲车队向天安门广场开进，因后面车辆受阻，他们单车英勇前进，先期抵达广场，对暴乱分子起到了震撼作用。在调转车头准备接应后续部队时，装甲车熄火，暴徒蜂拥而上，有的砸车，有的点火，这两位领导干部先后下车，宣传群众，揭露暴徒，惨遭毒打，身负重伤。
    在平暴斗争中，由于干部站在最前面，而暴徒主要又是打“当官的”，许多领导干部惨遭伤害，甚至有的高级干部、将军也负了伤，这种情况就是在过去的战场上都是少见的。某部副政委张堃少将，今年57岁，参军40年，他率一个师徒步开赴天安门广场。当时，师的领导考虑他年纪较大，路程较远，劝他留在后面，他说什么也不肯。他头戴钢盔，脚穿胶鞋，带领部队步行两个多小时，突破了21道障碍。行进中，他及时组织干部战士宣传群众，鼓舞大家发扬勇猛顽强精神，尽快到达指定位置。途中他的两只鞋被踩掉，脚板被碎玻璃扎破，脚趾头被踩得血肉模糊。后来，他被暴徒投来的石块砸成重伤，左腿被砸断，一下子扑倒在地。暴徒又对他拳打脚踢，有的还站在他的身上猛踢猛踩，他当时就昏了过去，多亏一位女工把他背到了急救中心。他的三根肋骨被打断，头被打破，肾脏和软组织严重损伤，外伤10多处。这位老战士参加过湘西剿匪，参加过对越自卫还击作战，在炮火纷飞的战场上，他立过战功，但没有负过伤，可在这次平息反革命暴乱中，在他手下有上万持枪官兵的情况下，却负了重伤。这是反革命暴徒们疯狂肆虐的铁证，也是我军干部、党员为捍卫共和国的安宁不惜流血牺牲的缩影。
    四、身处繁华都市，面对种种困难，广大官兵艰苦奋斗，秋毫无犯，显示了我军威武之师、文明之师的精神风貌
    在清理天安门广场、取得平息反革命暴乱初步胜利后的几天里，北京的形势仍然比较严峻，一些暴徒还在焚烧军车，并不时向部队、群众打黑枪，市区交通瘫痪，道路堵塞，政府和有些单位支援部队的物资难以运到天安门广场，部队的后勤保障遇到极大困难。当时，从将军到士兵，每天就靠啃压缩饼干、嚼方便面充饥，渴了喝一点自来水，有的部队直到6月11日才吃上热饭。在那最艰苦的日子里，部队忍饥耐渴不违纪，风餐露宿不扰民。大家有饭分着吃，有水传着喝，干部让战士，党员让群众，机关让连队，后勤人员让战勤人员。有个营每8个人分到一个面包，通信员想到营的领导非常劳累，再也不忍心让他们挨饿，悄悄留下两个面包。营长和教导员发现后，硬是把这两个面包送给了受伤的同志，自己只吃了一把分剩下的面包渣。有个连队从人民大会堂排队打回两壶水，仅够每个班泡一袋方便面。泡开后，全班传了一圈，谁也不忍心吃。就是在这样艰苦的条件下，没有一个人违反群众纪律。在广场附近执勤的一支部队，官兵们已一天一夜没有喝上水，在他们哨位旁的个体食品商亭外面，堆放着一大垛汽水，由于暴徒袭扰，店主闭门锁户，他从窗口看到解放军秋毫无犯，受到感动，主动打开汽水请战士们喝，被婉言谢绝。经过协商，作价卖给了部队，渴极的战士才将几十箱汽水一饮而光。
    那几天，数万名官兵露宿在广场及附近的街道上。6月初的北京，昼夜温差较大，又遇连续降雨，官兵无处躲避，时常几个人挤在一起，靠体温暖干衣服。由于运送被装的车辆大多被阻或被烧，许多官兵没有被褥，夜间只好以钢盔作枕头，和衣躺在冰凉潮湿的水泥地面上。此情此景，与40年前解放军在大上海露宿街头的情景极为相似。有位老工人看到这种场面，感动得哭了。北京是文明古都，平息反革命暴乱后，由于任务的需要，一些部队临时住进了中山公园、劳动人民文化宫、天坛公园等古建筑群。他们根据公园的管理规定，制定了保护文物的“十不准”等纪律。为使古建筑免遭污损，部队就睡在长廊上，或选空地搭起帐篷居住。为了减少火灾隐患，部队划定了禁烟区，抽烟的同志自觉控制吸烟数量；有的部队连续几天不生火做饭，以干粮充饥，一直坚持到撤离。
    我军这种秋毫无犯的严明纪律，来自于对人民的无限忠诚，无比热爱。戒严部队从受领任务一开始，就响亮地提出了“热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生”的口号，并自始至终付诸行动。在取得平息反革命暴乱的初步胜利后，官兵们还来不及休整和清洗自己的衣物，就立即走上街头，清除路障，清理垃圾，打扫卫生，协助有关部门恢复交通，出动车辆和人员为市民运粮、送菜、拉液化气罐等生活必需品。在亚运会场馆等国家重点建设项目工地上，指战员用辛勤的汗水，为首都建设增砖添瓦。
    军队爱人民，人民爱军队。在两个多月的时间里，戒严部队广大官兵亲身感受到了党和政府、人民群众对子弟兵的关怀。不论是干部、群众，还是青年学生，不论是白发苍苍的老人，还是系着红领巾的少年儿童，纷纷以各种方式表达对戒严部队官兵的深情厚意，从各个方面为完成戒严任务给予了大力支持。北京市和全国各地向戒严部队派出慰问团1300多批次，发来慰问信、慰问电20多万封。许多单位和个人还送了大量慰问品以及一部分捐款。事实雄辩地证明，平息反革命暴乱是一场正义的斗争，它得到了广大人民的支持；人民解放军永远是人民的子弟兵，她得到了广大群众真心实意的拥戴！
    首都戒严部队发扬的这种“共和国卫士”精神，是广大干部战士坚决贯彻军委主席邓小平一贯倡导的“五种革命精神”的具体表现，是与我军历史上闪闪发光的井冈山精神、长征精神、延安精神、雷锋精神、老山精神等一脉相承的。这种“共和国卫士”精神，既是60多年来人民军队优良传统的综合发扬和继承发展，又是新时期我军本质特征和思想情操的集中体现。这种“共和国卫士”精神，为我军的优良传统增添了新的风采，在我军光辉史册上又谱写了新的篇章。
