		Wenchang County in Hainan Province is a famous overseas Chinese hometown, and Copper Drum Ridge is one of its renowned scenic spots.

		This ridge is located on the eastern coast of the East China Sea in Longlou District, Wenchang County, connecting the west to the inland and the east to the South China Sea. On the ridge, there are legends of immortals, immortal halls, immortal caves, stone chambers, and Chengtian Lake. Particularly notable is the Wind-Moving Stone, which stands 3.5 meters high, weighs approximately 20 tons, is round on top and pointed at the bottom, and is supported by a stone beneath it. Despite being moved by the wind, it has remained standing for centuries, making it a remarkable sight. It is said that during the Han Dynasty, General Fu Bo led his troops to the South China Sea, pacified Zhuya, and on his return journey to the capital, left behind a copper drum. Later, people found the drum while digging and named the ridge after it. Copper Drum Ridge is majestic and grand, with beautiful scenery and a unique environment.

		From the base of the ridge, looking up, one sees overlapping green peaks and towering rocks stretching over 20 li, resembling a dragon leaping through endless waves. Standing at the ridge's peak and gazing out at the South China Sea, one sees surging waves like a thousand horses charging, with the roar of the waves echoing like war drums urging soldiers forward. Looking down into the deep valleys, the cliffs are steep and sheer, with countless strange rocks scattered within. The mountain streams are lush with forests, and the rare flowers and exotic plants are dazzling and enchanting. Gazing far into the distance, the seven islands 70 li away, with their seven peaks connected and two islands facing each other, can be faintly discerned. To the north of the ridge is the mouth of Baoling Harbor, where the sandy beaches are white as snow, like a silver belt winding and curving. On one side of the silver belt is an endless sea of trees, and on the other side are green waters and blue waves, with waves crashing like snow. Looking west towards Dongzui, one sees a thousand strange rocks, some submerged in the sea, others floating on the water's surface. The waves crash against them, and the spray flies, creating a breathtaking scene.

		In recent years, both domestic and foreign tourists have flocked to this place. Especially the overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau who return to their hometowns to visit relatives are deeply interested in appreciating this southern scenery and often linger, reluctant to leave.

    铜鼓岭
    刘建春
    海南省文昌县是全国著名的侨乡，这里的铜鼓岭是侨乡著名的风景之一。
    此岭位于文昌县龙楼区东海之滨，西连内陆，东濒南海。岭上有仙迹、仙殿、仙洞、石室、承天湖。特别是风动石，高三米半，重约20吨，上圆下尖，底部竖于石上，风吹能动，却长年累月不倒，蔚为奇观。据传汉代伏波将军进军南海，抚定珠崖后，振旅还京师时遗下铜鼓，后人挖地得鼓而名。铜鼓岭雄伟壮观，风景优雅，环境别致。
    从岭脚仰望，峰峦叠翠，奇石峥嵘，连绵20余里，有如万顷波涛中飞腾的蛟龙。在岭顶纵观南海，只见海潮汹涌，有如万马奔腾，涛声轰鸣，情如战鼓催征。俯瞰深峪，陡壁如削，万千怪石散落其中，山涧森林翠茂，奇花异草绚丽迷人。极目远望，70里外的七洲岛，七峰连峙，二洲相对，依稀可辨。岭北是宝陵港出口处，港湾沙滩洁白，犹如一条银带，蜿蜒曲折。银带的一边，是茫茫林海，另一边是绿水碧波，翻浪如雪。西望东嘴，但见怪石千姿，或沉于海，或浮于水面，波涛冲击，浪花飞溅，美不胜收。
    近年来，慕名而来的中外游客，络绎不绝。特别是回乡旅游探亲的侨胞和港澳同胞抱着浓厚的兴趣来欣赏这南国风光，往往流连不去。
