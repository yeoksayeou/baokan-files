The Egyptian newspaper *Al-Ahram* reported that the recent summit held in Baghdad between the leaders of Iraq, Jordan, and the PLO has resulted in an "Arab Emergency Action Plan" aimed at preserving Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The key points of this plan are as follows: calling for an emergency Arab summit to discuss the current situation in Lebanon; urging the summit to pass a resolution demanding that all "Arab and foreign troops" immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Lebanon; if the above two points cannot be realized, then seeking consensus among Arab countries on "limited military options"; initiating emergency military consultations aimed at establishing an "Arab Peacekeeping Force" to maintain Lebanon's unity.

    伊约巴三方首脑会议
    就黎局势提出紧急计划
    本报开罗8月21日电　记者林皎明报道：据埃及《华夫脱报》透露，刚刚在巴格达结束的伊拉克、约旦和巴解组织3方首脑会议达成一项维护黎巴嫩主权和领土完整的“阿拉伯紧急工作计划”。
    这份计划的要点是：呼吁召开阿拉伯紧急首脑会议研究黎巴嫩目前局势；呼吁首脑会做出决议，要求所有“阿拉伯和外国军队”立即无条件撤出黎巴嫩；上述两项如无法实现，则征询阿拉伯各国就“有限制的军事选择”达成一致；开始紧急军事协商，旨在组建维护黎巴嫩统一的“阿拉伯维持和平部队”。
