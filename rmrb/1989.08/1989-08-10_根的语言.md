	The Language of Roots
	Photography by Shang Guangzhan
	Poetry by Hu Xiaoguang

	You clearly understand
	This intricate bond of flesh and blood
	Indescribable
	Thus, intertwined and complex, thus, lingering and affectionate
	Your longing is also the land's longing
	And the silent land is so deeply affectionate
	You transform into trachea, into veins
	Pouring out the land's love
	To those longing hearts
	They will recognize it, they will understand it
	Whether it is the dancing branches or the singing leaves
	They will know this language of roots

    根的语言

    胡晓光配诗
    你清清楚楚地懂得
    这千丝万缕的血肉之缘
    难以说清
    于是盘根错节　于是缠缠绵绵
    你的依恋也是土地的依恋
    而默默的土地是何等的深情
    你化为气管化为血管
    将土地的爱恋倾诉给
    那些盼归的心
    会认得的　会懂得的
    无论是跳舞的枝条还是唱歌的叶片
    都会识得　这根的语言
