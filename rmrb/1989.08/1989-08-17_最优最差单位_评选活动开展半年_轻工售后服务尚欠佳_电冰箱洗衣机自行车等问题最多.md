Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 17th.

Since February of this year, the Ministry of Light Industry decided to launch the "National Light Industry After-Sales Service Best and Worst Unit" selection activity. How has the after-sales service work been in various places? Materials provided by the Ministry of Light Industry Quality Supervision and Management Committee indicate that the number of complaints has significantly decreased, and the number of commendations has increased significantly. However, the quality of maintenance and service attitude still need to be improved.

According to reports, in the first half of this year, the Ministry of Light Industry Quality Supervision and Management Committee received a total of 360 complaint letters, a 70% reduction from the 1,215 letters received in the same period last year. The number of commendation letters was 478, an increase of nine times from the 47 letters received in all of last year. The products most frequently mentioned in the complaints were refrigerators, accounting for 64.9% of the total complaints, followed by washing machines, bicycles, and clocks. Most of the complaints were about product quality issues and poor service attitudes.

A user from Jinan, Shandong, Mr. Lu De Xin, wrote to report that he bought a "Du Le" brand double-door 170-liter refrigerator from the Liuzhou Refrigerator Factory in Guangxi in May 1987. By May 1988, the body and edges of the door had several rust spots. He wrote to the factory to complain, but by February of this year, the rust had become severe. The factory agreed to have the refrigerator repaired at the factory. He sent the refrigerator back to Liuzhou, but in June, the factory sent back a 150-liter refrigerator that was dirty and old. Moreover, the inner shelves, light bulbs, and small knobs were missing, making the refrigerator unusable. He was very angry about the factory's business practices and after-sales service attitude.

Some consumers have reported that the "three guarantees" (repair, replacement, refund) for household appliances have not been fully implemented. For some refrigerators with quality problems, the stores do not take responsibility, the repair points push the responsibility to the factory, and the factory pushes it back to the repair points. Consumers cannot get the repairs done, running back and forth, and the problem remains unsolved for a long time, causing a lot of dissatisfaction. Especially for non-designated small factories, their refrigerators are sold without any maintenance, replacement, or refund, cheating the consumers. Some enterprises have poor product quality and even worse service attitudes. A user from Shanghai, Mr. Shen Yanxiong, wrote to report that he bought a "Yongjiu" brand double-seat tricycle with serious quality problems and had to run back and forth multiple times. When he called Shanghai Bicycle Factory No. 2 to inquire, the response was: "You know the quality is bad, so why did you buy it?"

### “最优最差单位”评选活动开展半年  轻工售后服务尚欠佳  电冰箱洗衣机自行车等问题最多

    “最优最差单位”评选活动开展半年
    轻工售后服务尚欠佳
    电冰箱洗衣机自行车等问题最多
    据新华社北京8月17日电  今年2月轻工部决定开展评选“全国轻工业售后服务最优最差单位活动以来，各地售后服务工作究竟如何？轻工部质量监督管理委员会提供的材料表明：投诉信大幅度减少，表扬信明显增多，但维修质量及服务态度仍有待提高和改进。
    据介绍，上半年轻工部质量监督管理委员会共收到投诉信360封，比去年同期的1215封减少70％。表扬信478封，比去年全年的47封增加9倍。投诉信反映问题比较集中的产品是电冰箱，占总投诉信的64.9％，其次是洗衣机、自行车和钟表。从投诉信中看出，属于产品质量问题、服务态度差的占多数。山东济南用户陆德新来信反映，他于1987年5月购买一台广西柳州电冰箱厂生产的“都乐”牌双门170升电冰箱，到1988年5月箱体和门边上出现数十个锈点，他写信投诉厂方，到今年2月已严重锈蚀，厂方同意寄厂修理。他将冰箱托运回柳州，可6月份这家厂寄回一台150升又脏又旧的电冰箱，而且冰箱里的隔层、灯泡、小旋钮都没有了，冰箱无法使用。他对工厂的这种经营作风和售后服务的态度非常气愤。
    据一些消费者反映，家用电器的“三包”规定还没有完全落实。有的电冰箱发生质量问题，商店不负责，维修点推给工厂，工厂推给维修点，用户求修无门，往返奔波，长期不能解决，意见很大。尤其是非定点小厂的冰箱出售后，不修、不换、不退，坑害了用户。有的企业产品质量差，服务态度更差。据上海用户沈炎熊来信反映，他因购买的永久牌双座三轮车存在严重的质量问题，多次奔波往返。他给上海自行车二厂打电话询问，对方竟回答：“你知道质量不好，为什么要去买？”
