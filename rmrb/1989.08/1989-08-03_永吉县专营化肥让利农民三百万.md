Yongji County in Jilin Province has implemented a state monopoly on fertilizers and has taken various measures to benefit farmers. Since the beginning of this year, the county's agricultural resources company has sold 58,000 tons of ammonium nitrate, urea, and other fertilizers. The average selling price per ton is 59 yuan lower than the provincial average comprehensive selling price, totaling 312 million yuan in benefits for farmers.

Since the implementation of the fertilizer monopoly this year, the company has adopted a direct supply method of "on-site, on-the-ground, and nearby delivery" to minimize intermediate links and reduce the time of fund occupation, thereby significantly lowering costs.
