During the counterrevolutionary riot that took place in the capital, the rioters hurled stones and bricks, savagely smashing military vehicles and assaulting the People's Liberation Army. The bloody scenes and horrifying acts, whether witnessed firsthand or through television screens, have left a deep impression on people. However, who could have imagined that a well-dressed, refined, and wealthy businessman like Wan Runnan would also pick up a "stone"...

As the president of the Beijing Four Communications Group, Wan Runnan often said, "We named our company's English name STONE, which means 'stone'." "Perhaps we are paving stones; perhaps we are a cornerstone of the new century's monument." On May 21, the second day of martial law in parts of the capital, Wan Runnan used the illegal "Beijing Voice" radio station operated by the Chinese People's University Students' Autonomous Federation to incite, saying: The government has stood on the opposite side of the people, so it is no longer the people's government. All sectors of the people should mobilize to smash the martial law and overthrow the government... At the same time, he reiterated: Four Communications is a stronghold, just like its English name STONE (stone) is hard. How to use this "stone" (STONE)? Wan Runnan's capable assistant and vice president, Cui Mingshan, told the leaders of the rioting students: "We go to Tiananmen Square almost every day," "As Four Communications, we can say our contribution ranks first in Beijing. We are taking the risk of the entire company being dismantled by the government!"

This means that Wan Runnan has picked up a big stone—the "entire company"—and thrown it!

On July 28, Wan Runnan made a confession at a gathering in Chicago, USA, about his role in the turmoil. He said: Any entrepreneur in any country or region is very careful to keep a distance from politics, but in this domestic student movement, "we got involved, and deeply so." He proudly declared: "Companies like 'Four Communications' and individual businesses are the most active supporters of this movement!"

However, at the beginning of the turmoil, Wan Runnan still needed to maintain a facade. At that time, Four Communications still had a regulation that employees were not allowed to participate in the turmoil during work hours. What was the actual situation? Cui Mingshan had once told the leaders of the rioting students at Tiananmen Square: "From the day you stepped onto Tiananmen Square, every minute, every second, we have been monitoring the reactions of all sectors of society and the world. We know more about the situation than you do, and our judgments are more rational." The director of the Comprehensive Planning Department and deputy director of the Public Relations Department of Four Communications, Zhou Dao, did not go to work all day and was with the rioting students. When someone asked him why he did this, Wan Runnan bluntly said: "I sent him."

So, what did they do during this period?

On June 28, the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao published a special report titled "Four Communications as a Channel for Overseas Support for the Beijing Student Movement." The article said: "In late April, the turmoil on the mainland was sweeping like a storm, and Four Communications became one of the channels for communication between overseas and mainland students." As a channel for communication between domestic and overseas reactionary forces, Wan Runnan and a few people from Four Communications indeed played a unique role.

Liu Xiaobo, who took credit for the turmoil, wrote an open letter to Chinese university students on April 22 in New York with the heads of the reactionary organization "China Democracy League," Hu Ping and Chen Jun, among others. The letter was intended to boost morale and provide strategies for the turmoil. Four days later, on April 26 at 9:30 AM, this open letter, written by Liu Xiaobo, was posted at the triangular area of Peking University. This plan by overseas reactionary forces to incite the turmoil was first faxed from the United States to Four Communications and then relayed from there. The messenger was Zhou Dao, who was previously mentioned as being sent by Wan Runnan to intervene in the turmoil.

Liu Xiaobo, sent by the "China Democracy League" to directly participate in the turmoil, was also greeted by Zhou Dao and two other employees from "Four Communications" at the capital airport. After Liu got off the plane, his "landlord" in New York, the wife of the head of the "China Democracy League," Hu Ping, called Beijing to inform Liu that he might not be able to get off the plane or leave the airport and might be detained. The next day after Liu arrived in Beijing, Hu Ping's wife called "Four Communications" again to inquire. After Liu Xiaobo arrived in Beijing, he became a frequent visitor to "Four Communications." He visited Wan Runnan several times for secret talks. On June 1, the day before Liu Xiaobo's limited hunger strike, he visited Wan Runnan at Four Communications with Wu'erkaixi. The two had a midday meeting.

On April 27, after Zhou Dao picked up Liu Xiaobo from the airport, on April 30, he participated in the "Spirit of May Fourth and the Current Situation" seminar organized by two reporters from the Asia-Pacific Economic Herald as a special correspondent for the World Economic Herald and the Asia-Pacific Economic Herald. He helped draft a petition for Qin Benli and, on May 3, they met again to finalize the petition. They also decided to mobilize the news media to "collectively observe" the student parade on May 4. At 12 PM on May 4, about 200 people from various news organizations gathered in front of Xinhua News Agency and then went to the Nationalities Hall to "collectively observe" for nearly two hours. Someone held up a pre-prepared banner, and the crowd joined the student parade, thus opening the door for social participation in the turmoil. This was a premeditated plot, and Hong Kong newspapers reported on the same morning that 1,000 reporters would participate in the parade. Zhou Dao arrived late for the gathering and chased to Xidan and Tiananmen to catch up with the crowd, claiming to have "joyfully" participated in the parade. After that, he actively participated in a series of activities in the cultural, academic, news, and student circles: he participated in the "Capital People's Constitutional Movement Joint Conference" several times and drafted "Letters to the People" twice on behalf of the conference; he led overseas guests to "Four Communications" to purchase communication equipment to support the rioting students; he was designated by Wang Juntao (head of "Beijing Spring," deputy editor of "Economic Weekly," and head of the privately-run "Beijing Social and Economic Research Institute") as one of the three financial supervisors for overseas donations...

As an emissary sent by Wan Runnan, it can be said that Zhou Dao did an excellent job.

On July 30, Hong Kong Ming Pao published a report by its reporter from Chicago on July 28, covering a speech by Wan Runnan. Wan said: "Striving for democracy is very expensive. On the square, the daily expenses are at least 400,000 yuan. Of course, a lot of money has been raised overseas, but most of it has not entered the mainland." How? "The Voice of America" broadcast of Wan Runnan's speech on July 30 provided the answer: "The students on the square mainly rely on the support of Beijing citizens, Beijing's private economy like 'Four Communications,' and Beijing's individual businesses." He openly revealed his identity as the "logistics director" of the turmoil.

A vice president of "Four Communications" once revealed to the leaders of the turmoil: "Four Communications" supported more than 200,000 yuan. In addition to a large number of food, drinks, and medicines sent directly to illegal organizations such as the "High Autonomous Federation," they also provided a batch of equipment for counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement, such as walkie-talkies, megaphones, and public address systems. The high-efficiency rumor machine at the "High Autonomous Federation" command center on Tiananmen Square, which played a significant role in the turmoil, was provided by "Four Communications"!

In addition to the funds of "Four Communications," there were "many overseas funds supported through Four Communications Company" (Hong Kong Ming Pao, June 28). After late April, overseas reactionary forces used "Four Communications" to provide illegal organizations such as the "Beijing University Student Self-Government Preparatory Committee" and the "High Autonomous Federation" with offset printers, typewriters, copiers, mini cassette recorders, and fax machines, among others. The liaison and pick-up person was a close friend of Wang Dan and an active participant in the Peking University Democracy Salon.

"The aid" had conditions. "Four Communications" had a subsidiary company, Lushan Company, which had a sub-company, Huacheng Courier Service Company. The head of this company once directly invited a member of the "Workers' Autonomous Federation" and several leaders of the rioting students from Tiananmen Square, giving them 180,000 yuan in cash, a walkie-talkie, and a Liberation-brand truck, and agreed to print leaflets, etc. The condition was only one: support the "reformists" within the party, oppose the "conservatives" within the party, and overthrow Li (Peng) to support Zhao (Ziyang). He did not hide his intention: "I just want to use my views to influence a large number of students."

The person who picked up the "aid" from the United States for the "High Autonomous Federation" also used the communication conditions of "Four Communications" to report the situation and plans for the Beijing student movement to overseas multiple times and received instructions. In early May, when universities were about to resume classes and the turmoil faced difficulties, a mysterious person in the United States once instructed over the phone: First, insist on the legalization of student organizations, which is the urgent task. Second, in addition to demanding the restoration of Qin Benli's position at the World Economic Herald, Jiang Zemin and Li Ximing can also be demanded to step down. Third, insist on continuing the News Guide published by students.

The instructions from the overseas reactionary forces, separated by vast oceans, were continuously issued through the "channel" controlled by Wan Runnan.

On May 20, when the situation in the capital became increasingly serious and many places had fallen into chaos and white terror, the State Council decisively decided to impose martial law in parts of Beijing.

The situation changed dramatically. The planners and organizers of the turmoil felt great panic. They knew that once martial law was implemented, troops entered the city, the turmoil was suppressed, and social order was restored, their plan to start the turmoil from Beijing, create chaos nationwide, and overthrow the state power through the turmoil would be completely shattered. Therefore, opposing martial law, preventing troops from entering the city, and overthrowing the government became their general directive and ultimate goal at that time. They were ready to "fight to the death" ("a group of people from the State Economic Commission's speech on May 19 at Tiananmen Square").

Facing this situation, Wan Runnan and his capable assistants felt they could no longer stay in the background. "Better to fight to the death than to wait for death!"

—Just as one of his capable assistants described, he jumped to the forefront, bare-chested, and picked up the "stone"—STONE—to "fight to the death."

On May 21, the second day of martial law in parts of the capital, he first summoned the leaders of four students from Peking University and other schools for a discussion, and then sent assistants to Tiananmen Square for an "investigation." After that, he convened a meeting of all Four Communications employees, solemnly announcing that he would personally intervene in the turmoil and reminding them: "My intervention means that Four Communications is intervening!" Facing the doubts of the employees, he revealed: "The higher-ups support us to do this!" With the encouragement from "above," Wan Runnan, disregarding the wishes of the vast majority of Four Communications employees, decided to break the pot and gamble everything.

One of Wan Runnan's capable assistants once described their mood at the time: "If we could persuade the students on Tiananmen Square to withdraw, Zhao Ziyang might still be able to return." Thus, a strategy was formed to use the withdrawal of students as a bargaining chip to force the government to lift martial law, force Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, and Li Peng to step down, and support Zhao Ziyang's return.

From May 21 to 23, in just three days, Wan Runnan not only convened two meetings of Four Communications employees, had five individual meetings with the leaders of the "High Autonomous Federation" such as Wang Dan, but also convened two meetings with the leaders of the rioting students on Tiananmen Square to discuss.

On the afternoon of May 22, around 4 PM, Wan Runnan sent people and cars directly from Tiananmen Square to summon nearly 100 student leaders from nearly 80 colleges and universities in the capital and other regions. After arriving at the Rainbow Chinese Restaurant in the International Hotel, Wan Runnan refused any service from the hotel staff, closed the door, and as the big boss, he waved the baton. He first affirmed the students' actions: "You have already achieved great victories and made great contributions." Then he encouraged them: "If your actions are compared to a work, it will be a masterpiece. The first and second parts of this masterpiece have been completed. If the third part and the ending are written well, it will be even more outstanding and great."

How to "write the third part well"? Wan Runnan suggested: "You should seize the opportunity to withdraw from the square and actively return to the school to fight on campus." He especially emphasized: "This way, you will receive praise from the entire society and be more advantageous for the next step of the struggle." What is the "next step"? He meaningfully said: "You know what it means for the army to enter the capital? If the students return to school, it will reduce one reason for the outside army to enter the capital... Then when the army comes in, what will it do?" He showed his hand: "Withdrawal, we have preconditions and demands." "The first condition is that the army goes back, and you return to school; the second condition is to lift martial law and restore order; the third condition is that Li Peng steps down, and Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, and others retire honorably according to the procedure; the fourth condition is to support Comrade Zhao Ziyang." He especially emphasized that this last condition was "very important."

At this meeting at the International Hotel, Wan Runnan, as a "commander," made specific arrangements: "You should first hold a press conference to clarify your views to domestic and foreign reporters. Second, when withdrawing from the square, you can hold a large activity called 'Victory at Midnight.' A grand march." He also emphasized: "It is a march, and it is for a new purpose to return to school."

On May 23, Wan Runnan sent cars to Tiananmen Square to pick up the student leaders who attended the meeting the previous day to continue the meeting at the "Four Communications" hotel to discuss and pass the so-called withdrawal "Proposal" drafted by the vice president of Four Communications, Cao Wuqing; at the same time, he invited nearly 20 reporters from the capital's news media to Four Communications, attempting to create public opinion pressure through them to force the government to act according to Wan Runnan's wishes.

However, the "Proposal" carefully planned, although some blatant reactionary content was deleted in the final draft, could not be published in the newspapers because the martial law order had already been issued; their carefully prepared so-called "Victory at Midnight" demonstration activity naturally became a bubble.

Wan Runnan did not have just one move. To overthrow the legitimate government, he had another move in progress at the same time. This was to force the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to convene an emergency meeting, and then convene a special session of the National People's Congress to lift martial law and remove the prime minister.

After May 20, the planners and organizers of the turmoil felt that solving the problem within the party was no longer very possible, so they turned their hopes to convening an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Yan Jiaqi, Bao Zunxin, and others first sent a telegram to the leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attacking the State Council for implementing martial law in parts of Beijing according to the authority granted by the Constitution, claiming that "the Constitution is currently being trampled on by a small number of people," and urgently suggesting to convene an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to solve the current serious problems; they then published an article in the Hong Kong Ming Pao, titled "Solving the Current Problems of China on the Track of Democracy and the Rule of Law—And to Li Peng," calling for "every member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, every representative of the National People's Congress, to cast a sacred vote to abolish the martial law order and remove the position of Premier Li Peng."

In response to this, the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute, under the direct support and command of Wan Runnan, immediately took action to plan and organize the illegal activity of collecting signatures from members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

On May 20, the first day of the announcement of martial law, Wan Runnan found the director of the institute, Cao Siyuan, to discuss and give instructions. On the morning of May 21, Cao Siyuan dictated and drafted a short message, "Proposing to Immediately Convene an Emergency Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," and sent it to the office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress member Hu Jiyue at noon. Hu made some modifications and was the first to sign. In the afternoon, all the staff of the institute took action, some visiting door-to-door, some inquiring by phone. Some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had doubts about the involvement of the Four Communications Research Institute and refused to sign, so Hu Jiyue added the name "commissioned by me to the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute."

Although the purpose of collecting signatures to cancel martial law and overthrow Li Peng was hidden, by May 23, the number of members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress who signed was still not many. Therefore, Cao Siyuan included the names of those who had expressed the need to convene a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress before martial law but had not signed the collection letter, and also arbitrarily included the names of a few members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress who had not agreed to sign, making up a list of more than 50 people. Hu Jiyue proposed to hand over the results of the "collection" to the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po for publication, and Cao Siyuan contacted the chief of the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po Beijing office, Liu Ruishao, several times to discuss the publication of the article.

On May 25, the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po published a headline news on the front page, titled "57 Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Petition to Convene an Emergency Meeting of the Standing Committee," emphasizing: "It is reported that the focus of the emergency meeting includes the removal of Li Peng."

Later, some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress who knew about the news from the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po refuted the rumors and made serious protests. The Four Communications internal staff also discussed it, and many employees expressed doubts and dissatisfaction. The Four Communications Social Development Research Institute, which was involved in the signature activity, also fell into disarray. Facing this situation, on the evening of May 31, Wan Runnan urgently convened a meeting of all employees of Four Communications. At the meeting, Wan Runnan firmly reiterated: "The Four Communications Research Institute is the Four Communications Group Company!" And regarding the accusations of some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on May 30, he made three points: "First, the blood must be hot, second, the mind must be cool, and third, the bones must be hard." He openly supported his comrades, urging them to stand firm in their reactionary position and stubbornly resist the party and the government to the end.

Nothing can be done as the flowers fall.

The counterrevolutionary riot that took place in the capital was suppressed under the leadership of the party, with the support of the people, and the joint efforts of the martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers. Wan Runnan's dream was shattered, and his desperate struggle failed. He escaped the pursuit of the public security authorities, colluded with overseas reactionary forces, and fled the country in early June.

After arriving overseas, under the protection of his foreign masters, there was no longer any need to disguise himself. Wan Runnan openly revealed his true face of being anti-party, anti-people, and anti-socialism. To achieve their goal of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subverting the People's Republic of China, Wan Runnan, upon arriving in the "free world" of capitalism, immediately colluded with overseas reactionary forces, newly defected "political elites," and those who had previously gone abroad, forming a united front. They openly raised their banner and began a new stage of their counterrevolutionary activities.

In July, taking advantage of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, Wan Runnan, along with the fugitives Wu'erkaixi and Yan Jiaqi, as well as Su Shaozhi, Liu Binyan, and others, gathered in Paris. They participated in the unveiling ceremony of the so-called "Statue of Democracy" and established the "Democracy China Front." Wan Runnan was also appointed as the secretary-general of this new reactionary organization. The facts show that Wan Runnan was determined to oppose the people to the end.

Reaching this point was not accidental. The Four Communications Company was originally tasked with high-tech development, and Wan Runnan also gained great honor through this. However, Wan Runnan had long declared that he did not establish "Four Communications" with an eye on technology and the economy; he wanted to engage in politics. On May 30, at the height of the turmoil, when Wan Runnan met with a reporter from Hong Kong Asia Television, he clearly said: "Political democracy requires a strong economic foundation. Social stability requires a class of the middle class." The so-called "middle class" was the bourgeoisie in their minds. How to make the "middle class" emerge in large numbers? Wan Runnan revealed more after fleeing abroad: The key is to solve the "property rights issue," "that is, the issue of property ownership, which must have a clear definition." In short, it is to negate the socialist public ownership and call for capitalist private ownership.

And to solve the ownership issue, in Wan Runnan's own words: "This has already gone beyond the scope of economic reform and become a political reform issue." At the same time, "active economic forces will inevitably have their political representatives." In addition to acting as such a "political representative" himself, Wan Runnan also organized a special team to discuss and promote his political proposals. This was the team led by Cao Siyuan, the "Four Communications Social Development Research Institute." From the day it opened, the institute took introducing Western bourgeois parliamentary democracy and amending the Constitution as one of its important tasks.

On March 26 of this year, the institute, along with the World Economic Herald, New Observations, and other units, jointly held a "Constitutional Amendment Theory Seminar." In his opening speech, Cao Siyuan clearly proposed to remove the names of Mao Zedong, Sun Yat-sen, and others from the Constitution, otherwise he "felt ashamed." Someone mocked that "dictatorship of the proletariat" was nothing more than "deciding everything by the power of a class, a party, a faction, and a person." This meeting strictly refused outsiders, but the British Guardian reporter still made a report: "The participants of this four-hour meeting demanded the deletion of any text in the Constitution that mentioned Mao Zedong Thought and the 'Four Cardinal Principles.'"

One was to achieve privatization and let a group of so-called "middle class" dominate; the other was to abolish the Four Cardinal Principles and achieve so-called "parliamentary democracy"—this was the blueprint of the bourgeois republic that Wan Runnan had long dreamed of. Of course, this was a pipedream!

The dark clouds gathering over Tiananmen Square were finally dispelled. Wan Runnan, with his shattered dream, fled abroad. The vast majority of employees of Four Communications saw through Wan Runnan and his close associates' role in inciting, supporting, and participating in the turmoil, and their reactionary face of opposing the people. Recently, the board of directors of the Four Communications Group and the Four Communications New Technology Industry Co., Ltd. have removed Wan Runnan from all his positions in the company and expelled him. Thus, Wan Runnan, who picked up the stone, finally only hit his own feet.

    万润南搬起“石头”要砸谁
    叶光
    发生在首都的这场反革命暴乱中，暴徒们抛起石头、砖块，疯狂地砸军车，砸解放军，那一幅幅血淋淋的场面，那些骇人听闻的暴行，人们或者身临其境，或者通过电视屏幕，早就看到了，见识了。然而，恐怕谁也难于想到，一个西装毕挺、温文尔雅、腰缠万贯的企业家万润南，也举起了“石头”……
    作为四通集团公司总裁的万润南多次说：“我们把四通的英文名字取意为STONE——石头的意思。”“也许，我们是铺路石；也许，我们是新世纪纪念碑的一块奠基石”。5月21日，首都部分地区实行戒严的第二天，万润南借非法组织中国人民大学学生自治会办的“北京之音广播站”煽动说：政府已经站在了人民的对立面，它就不再是人民的政府，各界人民要动员起来，粉碎戒严，打倒政府……同时重申：四通公司是一个战斗堡垒，就像它的英译名STONE（石头）一样坚硬。怎样用这个“石头”（STONE）？万润南的得力助手、公司副总裁崔铭山向闹事的学生头头说：“我们几乎每天都去天安门”，“作为四通公司，我们作出的贡献，可以说在北京市排在第一位的。我们是冒着整个公司被政府整掉的危险！”
    这就是说，万润南搬起块大石头——“整个公司”砸过来了！
    一
    对于自己在这场风波中的表现，万润南7月28日在美国芝加哥的一次集会上做了一番自供，他说：任何国家、地区的企业家都小心翼翼地与政治保持距离，但在这次国内的学潮中，“我们却沾上了，而且涉入很深”。他不无得意地声言：“像‘四通’这样的民办企业和个体户，是最积极支持这个运动的一分子！”
    然而，学潮之初，万润南还需要有一个掩人耳目的假象。当时四通公司还有过职工不得占用工作时间参加学潮活动的规定。实际的情况怎样呢？崔铭山就曾对天安门广场上闹事学生的头头说过：“从你们走上天安门广场那一天开始，每一分钟，每一秒钟，我们都监测着全国各阶层的反映，监测着全世界的反映。我们了解的情况比你们要全面一些，我们所作的判断，比你们要冷静一些。”四通公司综合计划部部长、公共关系部副部长周舵整天不上班，和闹事的学生搞在一起。有人问他为什么这样做，万润南直截了当地说：“是我派去的。”
    那么，这个期间他们干了些什么呢？
    香港《明报》6月28日登了篇专讯，称“四通”为“海外支持北京学运管道”。文章说：“4月下旬大陆学潮风卷云涌，四通公司成为海外与大陆学生沟通的管道之一。”作为海内外反动势力沟通的一条管道，万润南和四通公司极少数人确实发挥了独特的作用。
    以学潮黑手自居的刘晓波，4月22日在纽约伙同反动组织“中国民联”的头头胡平、陈军等，搞了份10人签名的《致中国大学生的公开信》，为学潮打气加油，出谋划策。事隔4天，4月26日早9时半，这份由刘晓波执笔的“公开信”，就张贴在北京大学的三角地了。这一代表国外反动势力为动乱所作的谋划，就是先从美国传真到四通公司，再从四通公司转递出去的。而担任“信使”的，正是前面提到的受万润南指派插手学潮的周舵。
    刘晓波受“中国民联”派遣回北京直接参与动乱，也是这个周舵同“四通”另两名工作人员去首都机场迎接的。刘上飞机后，他在纽约下榻处的“房东”、“中国民联”头头胡平的老婆便打电话到北京，告知刘可能下不了飞机、出不了机场即被拘捕等等。刘到京次日，胡平老婆的询查电话，又打到了“四通”。刘晓波到北京后，便成了“四通”的常客。他多次拜访万润南，进行密谈。6月1日中午，即在刘晓波发起的4人有限绝食闹剧的前一天，他还同吾尔开希一起到四通公司拜会了万润南，双方晤谈了一个中午。
    4月27日，周舵从机场接回刘晓波之后，4月30日，他又以《世界经济导报》和《亚太经济时报》特派记者的身份，参加了《亚太经济时报》两名记者串连召开的“五四精神与时局”座谈会，参与起草了为钦本立鸣不平的请愿书，5月3日他们再次聚会通过了请愿书，并议定5月4日策动新闻界“集体围观”学生游行。5月4日12时，一些新闻单位的200来人在新华社前集合后，到民族宫前“集体围观”近两小时，有人打出了事先准备好的游行横标，队伍便卷进了学生游行的行列，并由此打开了社会参加动乱行动的缺口。这是事先策划好的预谋，香港报纸当天早上便预报了1000名记者要参加游行的消息。周舵集合时迟到，硬是追到西单、天安门，赶上队伍，自称“欣然”参加了游行。这以后，他卖力地参与文化界、知识界、新闻界、学生界的一系列活动：他多次参加“首都各界爱国维宪联席会议”，两次代该会起草“告人民书”；他领着海外来“客”去“四通”购买通讯器材支援闹事的学生；他被王军涛（《北京之春》头头、《经济学周报》副主编、民办“北京社会经济科学研究所”负责人）指定为海外捐款的3位财务监督人之一……作为受命于万润南的“特派员”，应该说，周舵干的相当出色。
    万润南的一位得力助手曾经说：现在社会上盛传，我们“四通”是学运的后勤部、参谋部和指挥部。这些评价，万润南是当之无愧的。
    7月30日香港《明报》刊登了该报记者芝加哥28日专电，报道了万润南的一次讲话。万说：“争取民主是开销很大的，在广场上每天开支起码要4万元人民币。当然海外筹集了许多资金，但大部分未能进入大陆。”靠什么呢？“美国之音”7月30日播出的万润南讲话中，万自己作了回答：“广场上的学生主要是靠北京市民、北京的民营经济像‘四通’这样的公司，以及北京的个体户的资助。”公开地亮明了学潮“后勤部长”的身份。
    “四通”的一位副总裁曾对学潮头头透露：“四通”支援了20多万元。除了大批直接送到“高自联”等非法组织的食品、饮料、药物，还提供了一批供反革命宣传煽动用的器材，如无线电话、高音喇叭、电讲仪等等。天安门广场“高自联”指挥中心那部为动乱立下了汗马功劳的高效率的造谣机器，就是“四通”供给的！
    除了“四通”自己的资金，还有“许多海外金钱的支援通过四通公司源源流入天安门广场”（香港《明报》6月28日）。4月下旬以后，海外反动势力就利用“四通”向非法组织“北京大学学生自治会筹委会”、“高自联”等，陆续提供了油印机、打字机、复印机、微型收录机以及传真机等多台。充当联络员和提货人的，是王丹的一位挚友、北大民主沙龙的积极参与者。
    “援助”是有条件的。“四通”下边有个鹭岛公司，该公司又下辖一个华成托运服务公司。这个公司的头头就曾直接从天安门广场找来一名“工自联”常委和几名闹事的学生头头，当场付给1.8万元现金，一部无线电话，派给一辆解放牌卡车，并应允代印传单等等。条件只有一个：支持党内“改革派”，反对党内“保守派”，倒李（鹏）保赵（紫阳）。他毫不掩饰地说：“我就是想用自己的观点去影响广大学生。”
    前边提到的那位从“四通”提取美国“资助”的“高自联”提货人，还借助“四通”的通讯条件，多次向海外汇报北京学潮情况及下步打算，并接受指令。5月初，高校纷纷复课、学潮面对难题的时候，在美国的一位提供“援助”的神秘人物就曾在电话中指示说，一、要坚持学生组织合法化的要求，这是当务之急。二、除了要求恢复钦本立《世界经济导报》的职务外，还可要求江泽民、李锡铭下台。三、要把学生办的《新闻导报》坚持办下去。
    海外的反动势力远隔重洋的指挥，就这样通过万润南主持的“通道”不断下达。

    5月20日，在首都局势越来越严重，许多地方已陷入一片混乱和白色恐怖的情况下，国务院断然决定，在北京部分地区实行戒严。
    形势发生了急剧的变化。动乱的策划者和组织者们感到极大的恐慌。他们明白，一旦戒严实施，部队进城，动乱被制止，社会秩序恢复正常，他们设想的从北京乱起，搞乱全国，借动乱搞垮国家政权的预谋，就将完全破灭。于是，反对戒严，阻止部队进城，搞垮政府，便成了他们当时行动的总纲领、总目标。他们要“进行决死的斗争”（“体改委”一批人5月19日在天安门广场的演说）了。
    面对这种形势，万润南及其得力助手们感到不能再待在后台了。“与其束手待毙，不如拚死一搏！”
    ——正像他的一位得力助手描述的那样，他跳到前台，赤膊上阵，举起“石头”——STONE，“拚死一搏”了。
    5月21日，首都部分地区实行戒严的第二天，他先召集北大等校的4个学生头头商谈，再次派助手去天安门广场“调查”之后，召开了“四通”全体干部大会，郑重其事地宣布他要亲自介入学潮，并提醒说：“我介入就是四通公司介入了！”面对员工们的疑惑，他交底说：“上边支持我们这样做！”有了“上边”的授意，万润南不顾“四通”广大员工的意愿，决心破釜沉舟地孤注一掷。
    万润南的一位得力助手曾描述当时他们的心情：“如果能劝说天安门广场的学生撤走，赵紫阳也许还能复出。”于是，一个以学生撤退为筹码，逼迫政府取消戒严、逼迫邓小平、杨尚昆、李鹏下台，保赵紫阳复出的策略形成了。这是万润南下的第一着棋。
    从5月21日至23日短短3天里，万润南不仅两次召开四通公司干部大会，5次与“高自联”的头头王丹等人个别接触谈话，还两次召集天安门广场闹事的学生头头开会、商谈。
    5月22日下午4时许，万润南派人派车直接从天安门广场召来了首都和外地近80所高等院校的近百名静坐学生头头。来到国际饭店彩虹中餐厅之后，万润南谢绝饭店服务人员任何服务，关起门来，以大老板身份挥舞起了指挥棒。他首先肯定学生们的行动“已经取得了很大胜利，作出了很大贡献。”接着打气说：“如果把你们的行动比作一部作品，那将会是一部杰作。这部杰作的上篇和中篇已经写完了。如果写好下篇，写好结尾，那就更加杰出伟大了。”
    怎样才能“写好下篇”？万润南出主意说：“你们应该不失时机地撤离广场，主动地撤回学校，坚持校园斗争。”他特别强调：“这样，就会受到整个社会的赞扬，更有利于下一步的斗争。”“下一步”是什么？他意味深长地说：“你们知道，军队进京意味着什么吗？如果学生回学校了，就使得外边的部队进京的理由少了一分……那时候你部队进来，要干什么？”他亮出底牌说：“撤退，我们是有前提的，是有要求的。”“第一条，就是军队回去，你们回校；第二条，取消戒严，秩序正常；第三条，李鹏下台，邓小平、杨尚昆等老人按程序光荣退休；第四条，拥护赵紫阳同志。”他还特别强调这最后一条“很重要”。
    在这次国际饭店会议上，万润南俨然以一个“指挥官”的身份，做出了具体安排：“你们首先开新闻发布会，向中外记者亮明观点。其次，撤离广场时，可以举行‘凯旋在子夜’的大活动，大进军。”他还着重地说：“是进军，是为了新的目的才回学校。”
    5月23日，万润南一边派车去天安门广场接昨天到会的学生头头到“四通”饭店继续开会，协商通过由“四通”副总裁曹务奇代行起草的所谓撤离《倡议书》；一边把首都新闻界近20名记者邀请到四通公司，企图通过他们造成舆论压力，迫使政府按照万润南们的意愿行事。
    然而，绞尽脑汁策划的《倡议书》，尽管在最后成文时删去了一些露骨的反动内容，终因戒严令已经颁布，报纸未能刊登；他们精心筹办的所谓“凯旋在子夜”的示威活动，自然也成了泡影。
    万润南不只有这一着棋，为了推翻合法政府，他还有另一着棋正在同时进行。这就是迫使人大常委召开紧急会议，进而召开人大特别会议，撤销戒严，罢免总理。
    5月20日以后，动乱的策划者和组织者们深感从党内解决问题已经没有多大可能了，便把希望转寄到召开全国人大常委会的紧急会议上。严家其、包遵信等先是致电人大常委会领导人，攻击国务院按宪法授予的权力在北京部分地区实施戒严，胡说“目前宪法受到极少数人的粗暴践踏”，因而“紧急建议立即召开全国人大常委会紧急会议，解决当前面临的严重问题”；随即又在香港《明报》上，抛出《在民主与法制的轨道上解决当前中国的问题——并告李鹏书》一文，叫喊“每一位全国人大常委会委员，每一位全国人大代表，投下神圣的一票，废除戒严令，罢免李鹏总理职务”。
    与此相策应、相配合，四通社会发展研究所在万润南的直接支持和指挥下，立即行动起来，策划征集全国人大常委会委员签名的非法活动。
    5月20日，宣布戒严的第一天，万润南就找该所所长曹思源商谈，面授机宜。5月21日一早曹思源口授起草了一封《提议立即召开全国人大常委会紧急会议》的短信，派该所办公室主任中午送到全国人大常委会委员胡绩伟家，胡略作修改后第一个签名。下午，该所所有人员一起出动，有的登门拜访，有的电话征询。有些人大常委委员对四通研究所插手有怀疑，拒绝签名，胡绩伟委员便给加上了个“由我委托你们四通社会发展研究所进行”的名义。
    尽管征集签名信隐去了他们取消戒严、打倒李鹏的真实目的，但是直到23日，签名的人大常委会委员仍然不多。于是，曹思源便把在戒严以前表示过要求召开人大常委会议而没有在征集信上签名的人大常委会委员名单拉进来，还把几位没有同意签名的人大常委会委员也擅自列入，拼凑了个50多人的名单。胡绩伟提议将“征求”的结果交香港《文汇报》发表，曹思源便多次给香港《文汇报》驻京办事处主任刘锐绍通电话联系，商议发稿事宜。
    5月25日，香港《文汇报》在头版头条位置以“人大常委57人上书要求召开常委紧急会议”的通栏大字标题，发表了综合消息，并强调指出：“据悉，紧急会议的重点包括罢免李鹏。”
    其后，知悉香港《文汇报》这条消息的一些人大常委委员，纷纷辟谣，并提出了严正抗议。“四通”内部也议论纷纷，许多员工表示怀疑和不满，插手签名活动的四通社会发展研究所也乱了阵脚。针对这个情况，5月31日晚，万润南紧急召开了四通公司全体职工大会，会上，万态度强硬地重申：“四通研究所就是四通集团公司的！”并就5月30日部分人大常委委员的指责，发表了3点意见：“一是血要热，二是头脑要冷，三是骨头要硬。”公开为他的同伙撑腰打气，要他们站稳反动立场，与党和政府顽固对抗到底。
    三
    无可奈何花落去。
    发生在首都的这场反革命暴乱，在党的领导、人民的支持、戒严部队官兵和武警、公安干警的共同努力下，被平息了。万润南的美梦破灭了，孤注一掷的挣扎失败了。他躲过公安部门的缉拿，和海外反动势力相勾结，6月初私逃出了国境。
    到了国外，在洋主人的卵翼下，再也没有必要继续伪装，万润南便赤裸裸地坦露出他反党反人民反社会主义的真实面目来了。为了实现他们推翻中国共产党的领导、颠覆中华人民共和国的既定目标，万润南到了资本主义的“自由世界”，立刻和海外反动势力、新近叛逃国外及先期出国的“政治精英”们勾结起来，沆瀣一气，公开亮出旗帜，开始了他们反革命活动的新阶段。
    7月，趁法国大革命200周年纪念活动的契机，万润南和通缉犯吾尔开希、严家其以及苏绍智、刘宾雁等麇集巴黎，又是参加所谓“民主女神”像揭幕式，又是筹建“民主中国阵线”，万润南还被推为这个新的反动组织的秘书长。事实表明，万润南是横下一条心，要和人民作对到底了。
    走到这一步，决非偶然。“四通”公司本来是以高科技开发为己任的，万润南也借此换来了巨大荣誉。然而，万润南本人早就声明过，他办“四通”并非着眼科技和经济，他要搞政治。5月30日，动乱高潮之际，万接见香港亚洲电视台记者谈话时就明确地说：“政治民主要有强大的经济基础。社会稳定要有一批中产阶级。”所谓“中产阶级”，正是他们心目中的资产阶级。如何使“中产阶级”大量涌现？万润南叛逃国外后，点得更透了：关键在解决“产权关系问题”，“就是财产所有权的问题，必须要有明确的界定”。说白了，就是要否定社会主义公有制，呼唤资本主义私有制。
    而要解决所有制问题，用万润南自己的话讲：“这已经超出经济改革的领域，变成一个政治改革的问题。”同时，“活跃的经济势力必然会有它的政治代表”。万润南除了自己充当这样的“政治代表”以外，还组织了一个专门班子探讨、推行他的政治主张，这就是由曹思源牵头的“四通社会发展研究所”。该所从开张之日起，就把引进西方资产阶级议会民主和修改宪法作为自己的重要课题。
    今年3月26日，该所和《世界经济导报》、《新观察》等单位联合举办了一次“修改宪法理论研讨会”，曹思源在开幕词中就明确提出要把毛泽东、孙中山等人的名字统统从宪法中勾去，否则他“感到羞愧”。有人则挖苦“无产阶级专政”不过是“由一个阶级、一党一派、一个人的权力来‘决定一切’”。这次会议严格谢绝外人进入，然而，英国《卫报》记者还是作了报道说：“这次4小时会议的参加者们要求删除宪法中任何提及毛泽东思想和‘四项基本原则’的文字。”
    一个实现私有化，让一批所谓“中产阶级”占主导地位；一个取消四项基本原则，实现所谓“议会民主”——这就是万润南所梦寐以求的资产阶级共和国的蓝图。这，当然是一枕黄粱！
    聚集在天安门广场上空的阴霾终于被廓清了。万润南带着破碎的梦逃到了国外。四通公司广大员工看清了万润南及其亲信策动、支持和参与动乱，与人民为敌的反动面目，最近四通集团公司、四通新技术产业股份有限公司董事会已撤销万润南在公司的一切职务，将其开除出公司。至此，万润南搬起石头终于只能砸在自己的脚上。
