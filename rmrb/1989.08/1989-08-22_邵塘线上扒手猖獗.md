The Shaotang Line, part of National Highway 307, is 38 kilometers long. I travel this route by bus every month, and almost every time, I encounter incidents where passengers' money and belongings are stolen. One driver told me that 80% of the buses on this route have experienced pickpocketing incidents.

Once, my handbag was slashed three times, and some of my documents were stolen. Another time, 25 yuan was taken from me.

Some pickpockets even operate in groups, boarding long-distance buses and brazenly robbing passengers of their money. On the afternoon of May 1, six young men boarded a public bus from Shaoyang City to Tangdukou, passing through Qili Mountain. They were armed with knives and searched each passenger. No one dared to speak up. The situation on the Shaotang Line is so severe that the relevant authorities should take strong measures to address it.

    邵塘线上扒手猖獗
    邵（阳）塘（渡口）线属307国道的一段，距离38公里。我每月乘车途经此地，几乎每次都碰上乘客钱财被扒窃的事。一位司机说，这条线路上的客车80％有扒手作案。
    一次，我随身携带的手提包被划了3刀，一些证件丢失；另一次被扒去25元。
    一些扒手还成群结队，窜到长途汽车上明目张胆地抢劫乘客钱财。5月1日下午，我县汽车站一辆公共汽车从邵阳市返回塘渡口，途经七里山时，上来6个年轻人。他们手持匕首，对乘客挨个搜身，乘客们都不敢吱声。邵塘线上扒手如此猖獗，有关部门应该狠狠抓一抓。
