Title: Progress in U.S.-Soviet Strategic Weapons Negotiations Remains Minimal

The U.S. and Soviet delegations, led by the U.S. representative Bert and the Soviet representative Nazarkin, reported on August 3 to the 40-nation disarmament conference on the progress of their bilateral strategic nuclear weapons reduction talks. Both sides described the negotiations as "serious" and "beneficial," but acknowledged that progress has been "minimal" and that "a great deal of patient work" is still needed to reach a 50% reduction in strategic weapons treaty. The U.S. side also admitted that there are still "several dozen" issues on which the two sides disagree.

In summary, these several dozen unresolved issues can be roughly divided into three categories. First is the relationship between the reduction of strategic weapons and compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Both sides consider this to be the "main political obstacle." The Soviet Union insists that the reduction of strategic weapons must be linked to compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The United States, however, believes that negotiations on offensive strategic weapons should not be held "hostage" to strategic defense (i.e., space weapons) negotiations.

Second is the issue of setting limits on various types of strategic weapons. After several rounds of negotiations, the two sides have basically agreed on the total amount of strategic weapons to be reduced: each side's strategic weapons delivery vehicles will be reduced to 1600, and nuclear warheads will be reduced to 6000, with no more than 4900 warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. However, there are still disagreements on how to set the limits for the three types of strategic weapons: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers. The United States demands that the number of warheads on Soviet land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, which have an advantage, be limited to 3000-3500. The Soviet Union refuses to accept this, stating that unless the United States also imposes the same limit on its sea-based cruise missiles, which have an advantage, it will not accept. However, the U.S. side believes that the verification problem for sea-based cruise missiles is easy to solve, and therefore opposes including this type of missile in the treaty.

Regarding strategic bombers and air-launched cruise missiles, the Soviet Union proposes that air-launched cruise missiles with a range of over 600 kilometers should all be subject to restrictions, and that in the total limit of 6000 warheads, air-launched cruise missile warheads should not exceed 1100. The United States believes that only those with a range of over 1500 kilometers should be subject to restrictions.

Disagreements also involve mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union has an advantage in mobile missiles and has deployed SS-24 and SS-25 road-mobile and rail-mobile missiles. The United States also plans to develop mobile missiles, but has not yet decided between the single-warhead "midget" mobile missile and the multiple-warhead MX rail-mobile missile. The United States, citing verification difficulties, demands a ban on mobile missiles.

Third is the verification issue. Strategic weapons not only come in many types but also have several types with strong mobility, making verification difficult. There are still many unresolved issues in the verification annex of the draft treaty currently under negotiation. It is worth noting that on the first day of this round of negotiations, June 19, the United States proposed that the two sides begin trial verification procedures while negotiations are ongoing. The Soviet Union, in order to take the initiative, immediately agreed and proposed a counter-proposal, suggesting that the scope of simulated verification should include not only land-based missiles and mobile missiles but also submarine-launched missiles, strategic bombers, and air-launched missiles. The proposals and counter-proposals have made the already difficult negotiations even more complex.

The U.S.-Soviet strategic weapons negotiations began in 1985. After several years of negotiations, a draft treaty on reducing strategic weapons by 50% has taken shape. However, strategic weapons have long been the focus of U.S.-Soviet competition for overall military superiority, and due to the different compositions of the two countries' strategic weapons, their advantages are also different. Both sides are trying to weaken and limit the other's strategic nuclear forces through negotiations, while maintaining and strengthening their own nuclear strategic advantages. This round of negotiations will end on July 7. The bargaining in the future negotiations will remain intense.

    美苏战略武器谈判进展甚微
    新华社记者　向奎观
    参加美苏第11轮削减战略核武器谈判的美国代表团团长伯特和苏联代表团团长纳扎尔金8月3日上午分别向40国裁军会议通报了有关双边谈判进展的情况。双方认为谈判是“认真的”，“有益的”，但都承认谈判“进展甚微”，要达到削减50％战略武器条约尚需做“大量耐心的工作”。美国方面还承认，双方在“几十个”问题上尚存在分歧。
    概括起来，这几十个悬而未决的问题大致可分为三类。首先是削减战略武器与遵守反弹道导弹条约之间的关系问题。双方认为这是“主要的政治障碍”。苏联坚持削减战略武器必须与遵守反弹道导弹相联系。美国则认为进攻性战略武器谈判不应成为战略防御（即太空武器）谈判的“人质”。
    其次是各类战略武器分类限额问题。经过多轮谈判，双方在削减战略武器的总额上基本达成一致：即把各自现有的战略武器运载工具削减到1600件，核弹头减少到6000个，其中洲际导弹和潜射导弹的弹头不超过4900个。但是，双方在如何确定陆基洲际导弹、潜射导弹和战略轰炸机这三种战略武器的分类限额上仍存在分歧。美国要求把苏联占优势的陆基洲际弹道导弹弹头限制在3000—3500个。苏联拒绝接受，声称除非美国对其占优势的海基巡航导弹弹头也作同样的限制。但美方认为，海基巡航导弹的核查问题容易解决，因此反对把这类导弹纳入条约范围。
    关于战略轰炸机和空射巡航导弹，苏联提出射程在600公里以上的机载巡航导弹均应属限制范围，在6000枚弹头总限额中，空基巡航导弹的弹头不应超过1100个。美国认为，射程在1500公里以上的才属限制范围。
    双方分歧还涉及机动洲际弹道导弹和重型洲际弹道导弹。苏联在机动导弹上占优势，已部署了SS—24和SS—25铁路和公路机动导弹。美国也计划发展机动导弹，但由于在单弹头的“侏儒”机动导弹和多弹头的MX轨道机动导弹之间尚未作出抉择，美国以核查困难为由，要求禁止机动导弹。
    第三是核查问题。战略武器不仅种类多，而且有几类具有很强的机动性，核查难度可想而知。在目前正在谈判的条约草案有关核查的附件中仍有许多待解决的问题。值得指出的是，本轮谈判6月19日开始当天，美国提出双方在谈判的同时就开始试行核查程序的建议。苏联为了争取主动，立即表示同意，并提出反建议，要求这种模拟核查范围不仅包括陆基导弹和机动导弹，而且也应包括潜射导弹、战略轰炸机和空基导弹。建议和反建议使已经步履维艰的谈判更加复杂化。
    美苏战略武器谈判始于1985年。经过双方几年谈判，一项关于削减50％战略武器的条约草案已有了基本框架。但是，战略武器是长期来美苏争夺全面军备优势的重点，而且由于两国战略武器的构成不同，表现的优势也不一致，双方都力图通过谈判削弱和限制对方的战略核力量，保持和加强自己的核战略优势。本轮谈判将于7日结束。双方在今后谈判中的讨价还价仍将是很激烈的。
