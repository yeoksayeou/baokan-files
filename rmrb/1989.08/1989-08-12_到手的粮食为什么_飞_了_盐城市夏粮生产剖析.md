This summer's harvest was again a good one, with Yancheng's wheat production level leading in Jiangsu. The city harvested 16.6 million tons of summer grain, approximately 2 million tons less than the historical high of last year, ranking fourth in the 11 summer grain seasons since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Some people are not entirely satisfied with the summer harvest. Some grassroots cadres and technical personnel in rural areas say: This year's wheat had an unprecedented good growth, with a solid foundation for a bumper harvest!

However, the actual harvest was disappointing. Preliminary statistics show that, except for Sheyang County where production was slightly increased, the northern counties of Binhai, Rongxian, and Funing saw a reduction in wheat production, with a decrease ranging from 1% to 10%. The southern counties saw an even greater decrease. The city's average production level compared to last year saw a decrease of over 10%.

Where was the loss? Grassroots cadres almost unanimously say: It was mainly taken by diseases. Powdery mildew and fusarium head blight occurred simultaneously, causing mutual damage. The "two diseases" ravaged the wheat, significantly reducing the grain weight. In Binhai County, the thousand-grain weight decreased by more than 2 grams, offsetting the increase of 20,000 spikes per mu of good seedlings. According to agricultural technicians, the "two diseases" caused a loss of summer grain production between 10 million and 20 million tons this year. The "rotten wheat field" also resulted in a loss of about 9 million tons, turning potential increases into decreases.

In fact, the "two diseases" are not incurable. Timely application of pesticides can prevent their spread and avoid damage.

The various levels of government in Yancheng City have indeed worked hard on prevention and control. Urgent telegrams and notices followed one after another. Although the higher authorities shouted themselves hoarse, the message got stuck at the village and team levels. Farmers paid no attention to the less visible or even invisible powdery mildew and fusarium head blight. In some remote areas where broadcasting is not effective, some farmers did not even know about the diseases. This year, the price of pesticides continued to rise, and farmers, being thrifty, were reluctant to treat the crops.

The results of preventing and not preventing diseases, and how to prevent them, are vastly different. Sheyang County's various departments worked together, with effective propaganda, mobilization, organization, and services, resulting in a 5% increase in total production compared to last year. Even among neighbors, the yield difference between those who prevented and treated diseases and those who did not could be more than 200 kilograms per mu.

    到手的粮食为什么“飞”了
    ——盐城市夏粮生产剖析
    严季哉
    今年夏熟又是好收成，盐城的麦子生产水平在江苏冒了尖。该市收夏粮166万吨，比历史最高水平的去年减产约20万吨，在十一届三中全会以来的11季夏粮中，产量居第4位。
    也有人对夏熟收成不尽满意，一些农村基层干部、技术人员说：今年麦子是前所未有的好长势，有大丰收的基础哩！
    实收下来，人们大失所望。据初步统计，除射阳县平产略增外，北部的滨海、响水、阜宁等县，麦子均比上年少收，减产幅度在1—10％之间。南半部的其它县份减产幅度还要大些。全市平均水平与上年比，减产幅度有一成多。
    丢失在何处？基层干部几乎众口一词：主要被病害拿走了。三麦白粉病、赤霉病齐发，交互危害。“两病”肆虐，致使麦子粒重大为减轻。滨海县千粒重下降2克多，抵消了亩增2万穗的好苗脚。据农技人员分析，今年“两病”给夏粮造成的损失，将在10万吨至20万吨之间，“烂麦场”又损失9万吨左右，这样增产也就变成了减产。
    其实，“两病”并不是不能防治的，适时施药，就可以防止流行，免遭危害。
    盐城市各级政府也确实狠抓了防治工作。急电、通报一个接着一个。上面尽管喊破了嗓子，到了村组一级就打了噎。对不显眼甚至不露形状的白粉病、赤霉病，农民则不予理会。少数广播不通的偏僻地区，有些农民根本不知道。今年农药价格仍在上涨，农民惜本不愿治。
    对病害防与不防、怎么防，结果大不一样。射阳县各部门协同作战，宣传、发动、组织、服务有成效，总产比上年增5％。即使在邻居之间，防治病虫与否，单产悬殊大的也有200多公斤。
