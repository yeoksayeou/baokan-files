The Northeast Light Alloy Processing Plant, the largest aluminum-magnesium alloy processing enterprise in China, was once the only one of its kind in the country, and its products were in high demand. However, in recent years, the number of competitors in the industry has increased to over 360, making the market increasingly competitive. The plant, once secure in its market position, is now facing stiff competition.

The sales director, Liu Wen Zheng, pondered, "Many township enterprises and even some state-owned enterprises use gifts and kickbacks to attract customers. We can't follow that path, but what can we do?" He told his team of over 100 people, "I've thought about it, and the most attractive aspects of our factory are our product quality and our dedicated service. These two factors are definitely more valuable than anything else."

They worked hard to uphold these principles: meeting user requirements for product quality and specifications as much as possible; ensuring timely delivery despite constraints in electricity and transportation; and fulfilling urgent orders without hesitation, even if it meant working overtime. A user from Shenyang, who had switched to another supplier offering kickbacks, found himself in a bind when the promised delivery date passed without the goods arriving. The factory director was furious and scolded the procurement officer, "You chose not to place an order with the reputable 'Northeast Light Alloy Plant'? Do you still want to keep your job?" He then took the procurement officer directly to the 'Northeast Light Alloy Plant' to apologize. Upon learning the situation, the plant's leadership immediately arranged for the urgently needed aluminum rods to be delivered. The factory director was deeply moved and insisted on expressing his gratitude. Liu Wen Zheng replied, "There's no need. Our job is to serve our customers."

Such incidents, when repeated, naturally strengthened the plant's appeal to customers. Recently, the factory held a product ordering meeting for the second half of the year at the factory's guesthouse. Although the guesthouse had modest conditions and the location was not very convenient, and despite not offering any gifts, over 130 representatives from across the country still attended as scheduled. The orders placed exceeded the factory's plan by more than one-third.

Liu Wen Zheng explained, "Since 1986, we have held seven ordering meetings, six of which were held at the factory's guesthouse. We invite users to tour the factory, showing them our equipment, technology, management, and product quality. These impressions are deep, and they trust us, so the orders keep increasing year by year. The key is to ensure quality and provide good service to conquer the market."

    靠质量和服务闯天下
    ——记东北轻合金加工厂的销售工作
    新华社记者　张持坚
    东北轻合金加工厂这家我国最大的铝镁合金加工企业，本是全国“独此一家”，产品销售很长时间不用愁。可近年来，全国同行业已增加到360多家，争抢用户日趋激烈，“东轻厂”坐不稳“钓鱼船”了。
    可四下一摸，难了！“不少乡镇企业，也有一些国营企业，靠送礼和靠‘回扣’拉用户，我们当然不能随这个流，可我们怎么办？”销售处长刘文正苦苦思索着。他对手下100多号人说：“我想来想去，工厂最有吸引力的还是产品质量和热情周到的服务。这两条肯定比什么都有价值。”
    他们努力照这两条做：用户对产品质量、规格有什么要求，他们尽量满足；电力、交通紧张，可交货的日期想方设法不拖；有些用户临时来要产品“等米下锅”，他们从没二话，立即安排车间加班加点地赶……“东轻厂”有家沈阳用户的供销员，被有“回扣”的另一家工厂“拉”去了。不料，日期到了货交不出，催也不灵，急得厂长团团转。一问原委，厂长火了，骂那供销员：“你不在讲信誉的‘东轻厂’订货，还要不要饭碗了！”说罢，拉着供销员就直奔“东轻厂”来道歉。“东轻厂”领导了解情况后，马上把他们急需的铝棒材运出。那位厂长非常感动，执意要“表示表示”。刘文正说：“用不着，我们的工作就是为用户服务嘛！”
    这样的事做多了，对用户的吸引力自然就强了。前不久，工厂在厂招待所召开下半年产品订货会。虽然工厂招待所条件一般，交通又不太方便，订货会也不送什么礼品。然而，全国各地130多名用户代表还是如期到达，订出的货超过工厂计划的1／3还多。
    刘文正介绍说：“1986年以来，我们共开过7次订货会，6次是在工厂招待所开的。我们请用户参观工厂，看我们的设备、工艺、管理和产品质量。这些给用户的印象很深，他们信得过我们，因此，订货一年比一年多。关键还是要靠保证质量和搞好服务闯天下。”
