    Township enterprises across the country have made new progress in their adjustment and rectification work in the first half of this year, effectively controlling the continuous high-speed growth situation.

    Relevant departments introduced that in the first half of this year, the growth rates of the total industrial output value and industrial output value of township enterprises in the country decreased by 16 and 11 percentage points respectively compared to the same period last year.

    In the context of slowing development speed, tightening credit, and continued increases in raw material prices, the economic benefits of township enterprises have improved. In the first half of the year, the loan balance decreased by 6.05 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, equivalent to three times the increase in loans in 1988; sales revenue increased by 30% compared to the same period last year, profits increased by 20.5%, and taxes paid to the state increased by 31%.

    The scale of fixed asset investment has also been effectively compressed. In the first three years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the investment scale of township enterprises expanded year by year, with a net increase of 80 billion yuan in fixed assets. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, various places have carried out clean-up and rectification of ongoing projects. According to preliminary estimates from 19 provinces and municipalities, more than 10,000 construction projects have been stopped or delayed this year, compressing investment by more than 6 billion yuan.

    China's township enterprises have flourished alongside rural reforms and currently employ over 90 million workers, with a total output value equivalent to the national industrial output value of the mid-1970s.

    Relevant personnel believe that the development of township enterprises has made significant contributions to solving and alleviating long-standing social and economic problems in China, such as employment, rural poverty, long-term shortages of consumer goods, and major imbalances in the national economy. However, some places, projects, and products have also experienced certain degrees of blind development; some enterprises have problems with product quality, energy and raw material consumption, economic benefits, and environmental pollution.

    In response to the shortcomings of township enterprises, relevant departments have actively guided various places to adjust and rectify according to the central government's requirements, developing and improving a batch, helping to consolidate a batch, and transforming and releasing a batch. The tendency to emphasize quantity and speed has been initially reversed.

    Currently, relevant departments have decided to resolutely shut down and transform a batch of enterprises that waste energy and raw materials. For example, promoting the transformation of traditional brick kilns to energy-efficient vertical kilns or rotary kilns can save 4 million tons of raw coal annually. For small-scale coke production, promoting the transformation and improvement of furnace types and small-scale coke production can save 10 million tons of coal nationwide.

### 乡镇企业自觉调整适应形势  发展速度回落经济效益提高

    乡镇企业自觉调整适应形势  发展速度回落经济效益提高
    本报讯　记者何加正报道：全国乡镇企业的调整整顿工作今年上半年取得新进展，连续高速增长的状况得到有效控制。
    有关部门介绍，这半年，全国乡镇企业总产值和工业产值增长速度，分别比去年同期回落16和11个百分点。
    在发展速度回落、银根抽紧和原材料价格继续上涨的情况下，乡镇企业经济效益有所提高。上半年，贷款余额比去年同期减少60.5亿元，相当于1988年增加贷款额的3倍；销售收入比去年同期增长30％，利润增长20.5％，上交国家税金增长31％。
    基本建设规模也得到了有效压缩。“七五”前3年，乡镇企业投资规模逐年扩大，固定资产原值净增800亿元。自十三届三中全会以来，各地对在建项目进行了清理整顿。据19个省、市初步估计，今年以来就停、缓建基建项目1万多个，压缩投资60多亿元。
    我国乡镇企业是伴随农村改革蓬勃发展起来的，目前拥有9000多万职工，总产值已相当于70年代中期全国工业总产值。
    有关方面的人士认为，发展乡镇企业为解决和缓解长期困扰我国的劳动力就业、农民温饱、消费品长期匮乏和国民经济重大比例失调等严重社会经济问题作出了重大贡献，但某些地方、某些项目和产品也存在一定程度的盲目发展的问题；有些企业在产品质量、能源和原材料消耗、经济效益和环境污染等方面存在这样那样的问题。
    针对乡镇企业的不足，近年来，主管部门积极引导各地按中央要求，主动进行调整整顿，发展提高一批，帮助巩固一批，转化放掉一批，现已初步扭转了重外延、重速度的倾向。
    目前，有关部门已决定，下决心关停并转一批浪费能源、原材料的大户。如烧结普通砖的马蹄窑，将促其改为节能立窑或轮窑，仅此一项每年就可节约原煤400万吨。对土法炼焦进行并转，帮助改良炉型和小机焦改造，仅此，全国可节煤1000万吨。
