	Li Peng, the Premier of the State Council, met with the newly appointed ambassadors from Tanzania, Qatar, Nicaragua, and Zambia this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. The ambassadors are Ferdinand K. Rusinginda of Tanzania, Muhammad Saad Fahit of Qatar, Rogelio Antonio Bardison of Nicaragua, and Peter Lesa Kasanda of Zambia.

	Li Peng, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to the ambassadors and wished them success in their missions, hoping they would contribute to the friendly cooperation between their countries and China.

	Li Peng stated that the Chinese government, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, would provide active support and cooperation for the ambassadors' work.

	He told the ambassadors, "You all come from developing countries and are sincere friends of China. China and other developing countries have no fundamental conflicts of interest but share a common goal: peace and development."

	He emphasized, "The Chinese government reaffirms that developing relations with other Third World countries is a fundamental point of China's foreign policy, and this has been proven correct."

	Li Peng mentioned that China had recently suppressed a counter-revolutionary rebellion, and some Western countries had launched an anti-China campaign. However, developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America had shown understanding and support for China. The reason, he said, was that they shared common experiences and understood how Western countries used human rights and freedom as pretexts to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.

	He stated, "China's political situation is stable, and the Chinese government is exercising its authority normally over the 9.6 million square kilometers of Chinese territory. The economic sanctions imposed by Western countries may bring some difficulties to China's economic construction, but the Chinese government believes that, by relying on the people, we will definitely overcome these difficulties."

	He expressed that China would continue with reform and opening up, and that social and economic development would be more coordinated and stable.

	Li Peng hoped that the ambassadors would have the opportunity to interact more with the Chinese people and visit other parts of the country. He believed that facts would prove his words correct and stand the test of practice.

    李鹏会见四国新任驻华大使时重申
    中国致力发展同第三世界国家关系
    新华社北京8月30日电  （记者朱云龙）国务院总理李鹏今天下午在人民大会堂会见了新近就任的坦桑尼亚驻华大使费迪南德·克·鲁辛达、卡塔尔国驻华大使穆罕默德·萨阿德·法希特、尼加拉瓜驻华大使罗赫尔·安东尼奥·巴尔迪松和赞比亚驻华大使彼得·莱萨·卡桑达。
    李鹏代表中国政府和人民对这些大使来华任职表示欢迎，并预祝他们出色地完成自己的崇高使命，为发展他们国家同中国的友好合作关系作出贡献。
    李鹏说，中国政府包括外交部将对大使们的工作给予积极的支持和合作。
    他对大使们说：“你们都来自发展中国家，是中国真诚的朋友。中国同其他发展中国家没有根本的利害冲突，而有一致的目标，即和平与发展。”
    他说，中国政府愿在此重申，发展同其他第三世界国家的关系是中国外交政策的基本点，事实证明是正确的。
    李鹏说，最近中国平息了一场反革命暴乱，一些西方国家掀起了反华浪潮，但是亚、非、拉发展中国家对中国表示理解和支持，其原因是我们有着共同的遭遇，懂得西方国家是怎样以人权、自由为藉口来干涉别国的内政的。
    他说，中国的政局是稳定的，中国政府在中国960万平方公里的土地上正常地行使着职权。西方国家的所谓经济制裁可能会对中国的经济建设带来一些困难，但中国政府相信，只要依靠人民，一定能克服这些困难。
    他表示，中国将继续改革开放，社会和经济发展将会比过去更加协调、平稳。
    李鹏希望大使们有机会多接触中国人民，多去外地看看。他相信，事实将会证明他今天的话是正确的，是经得起实践考验的。
