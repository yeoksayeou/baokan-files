Over the past forty years, the world's annual fish production has increased from about 20 million tons in the early post-World War II period to over 95 million tons in 1988, an increase of 4.7 times. This has significantly improved people's nutritional status and contributed to economic and trade development.

Technological innovations have driven the increase in fisheries production. Advances in marine fishing technology, such as the use of synthetic fibers for fishing nets, on-board freezing, mechanical net hauling, trawling, and electronic technology, have led to the widespread use of large fishing nets, increased the tonnage of fishing vessels, expanded the operational range, and promoted the rapid development of the fishery industry. In particular, the 1982 United Nations "Convention on the Law of the Sea" recognized the right of coastal states to extend their jurisdiction over resources in their exclusive economic zones to 200 nautical miles, placing 95% of the currently utilizable fishery resources under national jurisdiction. This is clearly beneficial for the protection and utilization of fishery resources.

In the past twenty-five years, the species composition of international fisheries production has undergone significant changes. Since the late 1960s, the catch of cod in the Atlantic Ocean has been declining, while haddock has become the main fish species. Sand eel remains the main fish species in Japan. The catch of herring in the Atlantic Ocean initially declined but later rebounded. The global catch of tuna has increased, and the catch of shrimp has stabilized. Most shrimp and tuna come from developing countries.

In the past twenty-five years, the trade volume of fish products has continued to increase, from 450,000 tons in 1960 to nearly 1,400,000 tons in 1986. The value increased from $1.3 billion in 1960 to over $22 billion in 1986. The proportion of fresh and frozen finned aquatic products in the total trade value has increased from 25% to 35%, and the proportion of fresh and frozen crustacean products has increased from 15% to 35%. In contrast, the proportion of canned fish products has decreased from 25% to 15%, and the proportion of salted and dried fish products has decreased from 15% to 5%. The export share of fish products from developing countries, which was about one-third ten years ago, has now increased to 45%. The foreign exchange earnings from fish product trade have increased from $1.8 billion to $5 billion.

In the past, due to the unlimited expansion of marine fishing, many fish resources have declined, and fish production has also decreased. In 1982, the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, after years of negotiations, adopted a new "Convention" that affirmed the right of coastal states to manage fisheries within their exclusive economic zones. This has prompted some developing countries and developed countries to reach fishing agreements through negotiations to protect fishery resources.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, by the end of this century, the global demand for fish products will reach 100 to 110 million tons, of which 8,000 million tons will be for food and 20 to 25 million tons for fishmeal. In terms of resources, the potential for catching mid-upper layer small schooling fish, such as sardines, herring, and Peruvian anchovies, is significant, while crustacean resources have been depleted, and small crabs may have a slight increase, but shrimp catches are unlikely to increase significantly. The potential for developing and utilizing mid-layer fish and Antarctic krill is significant, but mid-layer fish can only produce fishmeal. Freshwater fish account for about 10% of the world's aquatic production, and production is expected to increase, but due to various factors, production is not easy to stabilize. Currently, the production of aquaculture accounts for about 12% of the total aquatic production, and by the end of this century, it may double. In the future, the potential for expanding the scope and intensity of fishing is limited, and the main approach should be to improve the management and utilization of various fishery resources to effectively increase the supply of fish products.

Improving fishery management is a complex issue. From the current and future global fishery situation, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between developing countries and developed countries, as well as among developing countries, in the fishery sector. At the same time, research should be conducted to improve new fishing, processing, and sales technologies, improve the assessment methods for fish resources, increase the capture efficiency of multi-species fisheries, and improve management methods to better develop and utilize global fishery resources.

### 全球渔业发展趋势

    全球渔业发展趋势
    朱丕荣
    近四十年来世界渔业年产量已从二次世界大战后初期的二千万吨左右，增加到一九八八年的九千五百多万吨，增加了四点七倍多，这对改善人们食物营养状况和发展经济、贸易都起了良好作用。
    技术革新促进渔业增产
    海洋捕捞的技术革新对于渔业增产起了很大作用。由于采用合成纤维制作渔网、海上冷冻、机械起网、尾拖网以及电子技术，使大型渔网得到广泛利用，提高了渔船的吨位，扩大了作业范围，推动了渔业迅速发展。特别是一九八二年联合国“海洋法公约”承认了沿海国家扩大其对专属经济区资源管辖范围的权力，即扩大到二百海里，使目前可利用的渔业资源百分之九十五都置于各国的管辖之下，显然，这是有利于渔业资源的保护和利用的。
    近二十五年来，国际上渔业生产的品种结构有了很大变化。从六十年代后期开始，大西洋的鳕鱼捕获量一直在下降，而狭鳕成为主要鱼类。日本沙丁鱼目前仍是主要鱼类。大西洋鲱鱼一度下降，以后又回升，全球金枪鱼捕获量扩大，捕虾量趋于稳定。虾和金枪鱼的大部分都来自发展中国家。
    近二十五年来，鱼产品的贸易量不断增加，一九六○年为四百五十万吨，一九八六年近一千四百万吨，价值从一九六○年十三亿美元，达到一九八六年的二百二十多亿美元。新鲜和冷冻的有鳍水族产品在贸易总值中所占比重已从百分之二十五增加到百分之三十五，新鲜和冷冻甲壳动物产品的比重也已从百分之十五增加到百分之三十五，而罐头鱼产品从百分之二十五降到百分之十五，咸干鱼产品从百分之十五降到百分之五。发展中国家鱼品出口比重十年前只占三分之一左右，现在占百分之四十五，鱼品贸易所获外汇从十八亿美元增到五十亿美元。
    加强国际合作，保护渔业资源
    过去由于海洋捕捞无限扩大，使许多鱼类资源衰退，鱼产量也因此而下降。一九八二年联合国海洋法会议在多年谈判的基础上，通过了一项新的“公约”，确认了沿海国家管理专属经济区内渔业的权力，促使一些发展中国家和发达国家通过谈判达成捕捞协定，以保护渔业资源。
    世界渔产品需求量增长
    据联合国粮农组织预计，到本世纪末世界鱼产品总需求量达一亿至一点一亿吨，其中食用超过八千万吨，鱼粉二千万至二千五百万吨。从资源方面看，海洋捕捞的中上层小型集群鱼类捕获量潜力较大，如沙丁鱼、鲱鱼和秘鲁鱼等，而甲壳类资源已衰竭，小蟹可能有少量增加，捕量虾不会有大的增加。中层鱼和南极虾开发利用潜力较大，但中层鱼只能生产鱼粉。淡水鱼约占世界水生物产量的百分之十，产量将有所增加，但受各种因素影响，生产不易稳定。目前世界水产养殖的产量只占水产总产量的百分之十二左右，到本世纪末，有可能翻一番。今后依靠扩大捕捞范围和强度的潜力是有限的，主要应通过改善对各种渔业资源的管理和利用，来有效地增加鱼品供应量。
    改善渔业管理
    改善渔业管理是一个复杂的问题。从目前和未来的世界渔业形势看，需要加强发展中国家和发达国家以及发展中国家间在渔业领域的合作。同时，要研究提高新型捕捞、加工和销售技术，改进类鱼资源的评估方法，提高多品种渔业的捕捞效率，并改进管理方法，为更好发展和利用世界渔业资源而努力。
