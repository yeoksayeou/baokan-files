A device used to treat enuresis in adults and adolescents, the "Enuresis Treatment Device," has recently been successfully developed by the Jinan Military Region General Hospital.

Bedwetting during sleep is a common condition, particularly prevalent among adolescents. Previously, treatments using traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture yielded unsatisfactory results. The "Enuresis Treatment Device" is based on the principle of conditioned reflex. When the patient feels the urge to urinate, the sensation is transmitted to the device, which then stimulates the corresponding nerves to wake the patient, gradually helping them control the condition. This device weighs only 20 grams and can be worn by the patient during sleep. Clinical trials have shown that regardless of the severity of the bedwetting, the device can produce immediate results. After a period of use, patients gradually improve their self-control, ultimately achieving a cure.

    “遗尿治疗仪”研制成功
    新华社济南8月10日电　（通讯员孙伟杰、记者王志耘）一种用于治疗成年人或青少年尿床症的仪器——“遗尿治疗仪”最近由济南军区总医院研制成功。
    熟睡中遗尿是一种常见疾病，尤其在青少年中比较多。过去采用中药、针灸等方法治疗效果不大理想。“遗尿治疗仪”是根据条件反射的原理制造的。患者有了尿胀感便会传导到随身携带的仪器上，仪器刺激患者相应的神经系统使之清醒，从而达到逐步控制遗尿的作用。这种仪器重量仅20克，患者只需睡觉时带在身上即可。经临床试验，无论病人遗尿如何严重，均能做到当天见效，经过一段时间便会逐步提高自我控制能力，最终达到治愈的目的。
