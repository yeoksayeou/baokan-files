    **Macroeconomic Control: Addressing Fragmentation and Disorder**
    **— Bai Cisheng, Director of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, Discusses the Implementation of Industrial Policies**
    **By People's Daily Reporter Pi Shuyi**

    “If we continue like this, modernization will be impossible!” Speaking about the issues of arbitrary project approvals and scattered layouts in the economic construction, Bai Cisheng, Director of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, began with this sigh.

    In recent years, the problems of arbitrary project approvals and scattered layouts have been particularly prominent in the machinery and electronics industry. The craze for cars, motorcycles, cables, elevators, refrigerators... the waves of enthusiasm have now shifted to VCRs, color tubes, glass shells. The severity of the scattered and disordered situation is shocking. Bai Cisheng gave examples: car factories: there are over 100 nationwide, producing 600,000 vehicles in 1988, averaging about 5,000 vehicles per factory, with some producing only a hundred or eighty vehicles a year; while foreign large car factories produce around a million vehicles a year, a difference of ten thousand times. Elevator factories: there are over 300 nationwide, producing a total of 12,000 units, with the highest producing factory, Changcheng Elevator Factory, producing only 650 units a year, and 200 small-scale factories producing less than 10 units a year; while the American Otis Company produces 20,000 units a year, and the Swiss Schindler Company produces 13,000 units...

    Bai Cisheng said: The vitality of modern industry lies in specialization and mass production. Our country has a weak foundation, with limited capital and resources, so developing industry requires focusing on key areas. Like the current scattered layout, each forming its own system, repeatedly introducing and constructing, not only causes huge waste but also makes it difficult to improve levels, exacerbating industrial structure imbalances.

    Bai Cisheng has been involved in machinery and electronics industry planning for many years and is familiar with the industry's history and current situation. He analyzed the causes of the scattered and disordered situation.

    The scattered layout has a long history. In the past, with a product-based economy, an administrative management system of departmental and regional divisions was implemented, each acting independently, forming self-sufficient systems, leading to large and complete, small and complete setups. The current fiscal system of separate accounting and level-by-level responsibility has also caused scattered situations, with local governments at all levels seeking to increase revenue, pursuing whatever is profitable. Isn't there a saying: “If you don't build a textile or tobacco factory, you can't be a county magistrate; if you don't build a color TV factory, you can't be a provincial governor.” In this situation, the role of industry management departments has been weakened, nominally managing the macro level but lacking necessary control measures, facing scattered and disordered situations, they are powerless.

    The scattered and disordered situation is also related to the past “large-scale” approach, organizing economic construction not according to economic laws, but accustomed to mass movements, whatever is in short supply, everyone rushes to produce, causing a “stampede,” with investment project approvals lacking responsibility and legal constraints.

    In March of this year, the State Council published the key points of the current industrial policy, emphasizing that implementing the industrial policy must address fragmentation and disorder, firmly restricting what needs to be restricted and planning and step-by-step developing what needs to be developed, avoiding a rush to action.

    Some comrades believe that we are now pursuing a commodity economy, advocating free competition, and need not worry about fragmentation and disorder, as competition will naturally lead to a certain economic scale through survival of the fittest. Bai Cisheng disagrees. He believes: Our commodity economy is still an incomplete commodity economy, and the market mechanism cannot fully function. In reality, local governments protect their own enterprises, often resulting in the strong not winning and the weak not being eliminated. Moreover, in such a large and poor country, the layout of productive forces cannot be without planning, with everyone acting arbitrarily; resources and funds cannot be overly scattered, without considering economies of scale.

    Bai Cisheng emphasizes strengthening the role of industry management departments in implementing industrial policies through macroeconomic control. Industry management departments are the key nodes for implementing industrial policies, linking national industrial policies with local specific construction projects. Industry management departments should formulate corresponding industry development plans based on national industrial policies, clearly defining what to restrict, what to develop, and how to develop, and use economic, administrative, and other means to implement them. In the current situation where the market mechanism is not yet mature, necessary administrative measures should still be used. Regarding the current state of the machinery and electronics industry, Bai Cisheng proposes five suggestions for addressing fragmentation and disorder:

    First, develop industry plans. Based on industrial policies and actual situations, formulate scientific industry plans that reflect economies of scale while considering local interests.

    Second, various levels of planning commissions should review machinery and electronics construction projects before approval, with industry management departments providing opinions based on industry plans. The approval authority for construction projects should not be delegated layer by layer but should be at the central and provincial/municipal levels.

    Third, the direction of bank loans should be coordinated with industry plans. Projects not included in the plans should not receive loans. At the same time, price, tax, interest rate, and other economic measures should be used to ensure the implementation of industry plans, restricting or encouraging certain projects.

    Fourth, for some key hot products suitable for concentrated production, such as cars, VCRs, program-controlled exchanges, etc., issue mandatory plans, and no department or locality should start projects outside the plan. When formulating plans, fully consider local interests, introduce competitive bidding mechanisms, encourage local-to-local and local-to-national joint ventures, joint investments, and shared benefits.

    Fifth, macroeconomic control should be standardized, scientific, and legalized, and laws such as the Machinery and Electronics Industry Revitalization Law, Comprehensive Industry Planning Law, Industry Management Law, and Enterprise Establishment Law should be formulated as soon as possible.

    Bai Cisheng summarizes his ideas into four sentences: One order for industrial policies, one account for industry plans, multiple channels for funding sources, and diverse adjustment measures.

    宏观调控  治散治乱
    ——机电部计划司司长白慈生谈落实产业政策
    本报记者　皮树义
    “这样下去，现代化化不了！”说起经济建设中的乱上项目、分散布点问题，机电工业部计划司司长白慈生，一开口就发出了这样的感慨。
    这几年，乱上项目、分散布点问题在机电工业中尤为突出。汽车热、摩托车热、电缆热、电梯热、冰箱热……热浪滚滚，如今又转向了录相机热、彩管热、玻壳热。散乱现象之严重，令人触目惊心。白慈生举例，汽车厂：全国有100多家，1988年产60万辆，平均每家约产5000辆，少的年产不过百八十辆；而国外大汽车厂都是年产百万辆左右，相差一万倍。电梯厂：全国300多家，总产1.2万台，产量最多的长城电梯厂，年产不过650台，200家规模小的，年产不到10台；而美国奥迪斯公司年产2万台，瑞士迅达公司年产也有1.3万台……
    白慈生说：现代工业的生命力在于专业化、大批量。我们国家底子薄，资金、资源有限，发展工业更要好钢用在刀刃上。像现在这样分散布局，自成体系，重复引进，重复建设，不仅造成了巨大浪费，而且水平也很难提高，加剧了产业结构的失调。
    白慈生多年从事机电工业计划工作，对机电工业的历史和现状比较熟悉。他分析了造成散乱局面的原因。
    分散格局由来已久。过去，搞产品经济，实行的是部门分割、地区分割的行政管理体制，各自为政，都要自成体系，自给自足，造成大而全，小而全。当前实行的分灶吃饭、逐级包干的财政体制造成了分散状况，各级地方政府都要增加财源，什么赚钱上什么。不是有这么一句顺口溜嘛：“不办纱厂、烟厂，不能当县长；不办彩电厂，不能当省长”。在这种情况下，行业管理部门的作用又削弱了，名为管宏观，却缺乏必要的调控手段，面对散乱，无能为力。
    散乱局面还与过去“大办”有关，组织经济建设不按经济规律办事，而是习惯于搞群众运动，什么东西紧缺，就大家一起上，造成“一窝蜂”，投资立项审查没有责任制和法律约束。
    今年3月，国务院公布了当前产业政策的要点，落实产业政策必须治散治乱，该限制的要坚决限制，该发展的要有计划有步骤地发展，不能一哄而上。
    有的同志认为，现在我们搞的是商品经济，提倡自由竞争，不必担心散乱，随着竞争的发展，优胜劣汰，自然会形成一定的经济规模。白慈生对此不以为然。他认为：我们的商品经济还是发育不完全的商品经济，市场机制还不能充分发挥作用。实际上，地方对自己的企业采取保护主义政策，结果往往是优而不胜，劣而不汰。再说，我们这样一个大国，一个穷国，生产力布局更不能没有规划，各自任意行事；资源、资金更不能过于分散使用，不讲规模效益。
    白慈生强调加强行业管理部门在落实产业政策中的宏观调控作用。行业管理部门是落实产业政策的关节点，它联系着国家的产业政策和地方的具体建设项目。行业管理部门要根据国家的产业政策制定相应的行业发展规划，明确限制什么，发展什么，如何发展，并运用经济、行政等手段加以落实。在当前市场机制不健全的情况下，必要的行政手段还应当使用。针对机电工业的现状，如何治散治乱，白慈生提出5条建议：
    第一，搞好行业规划。根据产业政策和实际情况，制定出体现规模效益又照顾地方利益的科学的行业规划。
    第二，各级计委审批机电方面建设项目，须先经机电工业归口管理部门审查，行业管理部门根据行业规划提出意见。建设项目的审批权不能层层下放，应当在中央和省市两级。
    第三，银行的信贷方向应与行业规划相协调。未纳入规划的项目不能贷款。同时，也要运用价格、税收、利率等经济手段，保证行业规划的落实，限制或鼓励某些项目。
    第四，对于一些适于集中生产的重点热门产品如轿车、录相机、程控交换机等，下达指令性计划，任何部门和地方不得在计划外上项目。在编制计划时应充分考虑地方利益，引入竞争招标机制，鼓励地方与地方、地方与国家联合办厂，联合投资，利益共享。
    第五，宏观调控要规范化、科学化、法制化，抓紧制定机电工业振兴法、全行业统筹规划法、行业管理法、企业开办法等法律。
    白慈生把他的想法归纳为四句话：产业政策一个令，行业规划一本帐，资金来源多渠道，调节手段多样化。
