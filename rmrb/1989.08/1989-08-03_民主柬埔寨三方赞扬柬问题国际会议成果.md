The three factions of Democratic Kampuchea have praised the outcomes of the first phase of the international conference on Cambodia. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, gave a positive evaluation of the conference's achievements. He told reporters, "From the perspective of the obstacles faced by the conference, the achievements are 'unexpected,' 'This is a very good start.'"

Son Sann, the prime minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, told Xinhua News Agency's reporter, "This is a good document, indicating that the talks on the Cambodia issue have had a good start." He said, "It is known that the four-party roundtable conference on Cambodia held in Paris did not achieve results, which was caused by Hun Sen's insistence on a rigid stance. Now, under public opinion pressure, Vietnam and Hun Sen have to accept the above working document." He pointed out, "We must admit that we still face huge obstacles, namely whether Vietnam will truly withdraw its troops and how to form a four-party coalition government."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 2 — The biggest victory of the ministerial-level meeting of the Paris International Conference on the Cambodia issue is that the proposal for a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodia issue has been widely accepted, and Vietnam's proposal for a "partial solution" has been rejected. In this sense, the conference has thwarted some of Vietnam's schemes.

This is what Khieu Samphan, vice-chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea responsible for foreign affairs, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency's reporter this afternoon. He agreed with Sihanouk and Son Sann's evaluation of the achievements of this ministerial-level meeting: a good start.

Khieu Samphan said, "The difficulties in the second phase—the working committee meeting phase—are very great. The biggest difficulty comes from the fact that Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime have not changed their rigid stance. Please note: Nguyen Co Thach and Hun Sen recently announced in Paris that the total number of regular Vietnamese troops stationed in Cambodia is only 26,000. In the past, they said there were 50,000 left, now it has been reduced to 26,000, which is a blatant lie! At this point, Khieu Samphan spread out a map of Cambodia on the glass table, listed the distribution of Vietnamese troops, and calculated with his fingers, saying: 'The total number of regular Vietnamese troops in Cambodia is at least 100,000! Can this show their sincere intention to withdraw troops?' He also said, 'On the eve of the opening of the international conference, Vietnamese troops and Heng Samrin's forces heavily shelled Cambodian refugee camps and peaceful Thai territory, which shows that they have no intention of politically solving the Cambodia issue. The concern is that Vietnam will not easily make concessions on substantive issues and will create obstacles during the conference to carry out its schemes. Therefore, it is difficult for me to make an accurate prediction about the future of the conference.'

When sending off the reporter, Khieu Samphan added, "Of course, the pressure of international public opinion will continue to increase, and Vietnam's domestic economic difficulties will only worsen. The situation of being besieged both internally and externally will eventually force it to accept the plan for a comprehensive political solution."

    民主柬埔寨三方赞扬柬问题国际会议成果
    新华社巴黎8月1日电  参加柬埔寨问题国际会议的民柬主席西哈努克亲王对国际会议第一阶段取得的成果给予积极的评价。他对记者说，从会议所面临的障碍这个角度来看，所取得的成果是“出乎预料的”，“这是一个非常好的开端”。
    民柬联合政府总理宋双对新华社记者说，“这是一个好文件，表明柬埔寨问题的会谈已经有了一个良好开端。”他说，
  “众所周知，在巴黎举行的柬埔寨四方圆桌会议没有取得成果，这是洪森坚持顽固立场造成的。现在，越南和洪森在公众舆论的压力下，不得不接受上述工作文件。”他指出，“我们必须承认，我们面前仍然存在着巨大的障碍，即越南是否真正撤军和如何组成四方联合政府。”
    新华社巴黎8月2日电  （记者杨木、沈孝泉）柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议部长级会议最大的胜利是，全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的建议被普遍接受，越南的“部分解决”的主张被否定。从这个意义来说，会议挫败了越南的一些图谋。
    这是民柬负责外交事务的副主席乔森潘今天下午在此间接受新华社记者专访时说的。他表示同意西哈努克和宋双对这次部长级会议成就的评价：一个良好的开端。
    乔森潘说，第二阶段——工作委员会会议阶段，困难是很大的。最大的困难来自越南和金边政权没有改变其顽固立场。请大家注意：阮基石和洪森最近在巴黎宣布，越南驻扎在柬埔寨的全部正规军只有26000人。过去，他们讲过剩下50000人，现在减至26000人了，真是弥天大谎！说到这里，乔森潘在玻璃几上展开柬埔寨地图，列数越军分布情况并屈指一算说：“越南正规军在柬埔寨总数至少10万人！这难道能表明他们有真正撤军诚意吗？”他还说：“国际会议开幕前夕，越军和韩桑林军队猛烈炮轰柬埔寨难民营及泰国的和平领土，这显示他们并没有政治解决柬埔寨问题的诚意。人们担心的是，越南不容易在实质问题上有所退让，而会在会议过程中横生枝节推行其阴谋。因此，我对会议的前途很难作出准确的预测。”
    当送走记者时，乔森潘补充说：“当然，国际上正义舆论的压力会越来越大，越南国内经济困难也有增无减。内外交困的处境终会使它接受全面政治解决的方案的。”
