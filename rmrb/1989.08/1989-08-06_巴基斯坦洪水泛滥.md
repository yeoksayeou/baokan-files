Floods in Pakistan have resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, with approximately 10,000 villages submerged and 270,000 hectares of crops destroyed.

Pakistan has experienced heavy rainfall over the past few days, leading to severe flooding. The provinces most affected are Punjab in the central region and Sindh in the south. Several domestic flights have been canceled due to the floods.

Currently, Pakistan is mobilizing nationwide efforts to combat the floods. The government is distributing relief supplies to the affected areas, establishing medical centers, and declaring agricultural loan exemptions for the disaster-stricken regions.
