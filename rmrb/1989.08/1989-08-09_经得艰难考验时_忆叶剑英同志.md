		Comrade Ye Jianying is a renowned statesman and military strategist of our Party, state, and army. He dedicated his entire life to the cause of liberating the Chinese people and building socialism. He is well-versed in both literary and military arts, possesses outstanding talents, and is skilled in poetry and calligraphy, earning him the title of "scholar-general."

		In his early years, due to his impoverished family background, Ye Jianying drifted to Southeast Asia in search of a living. Upon returning to China, he enrolled in the Yunnan Military Academy and later joined the revolutionary cause led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He participated in the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy and the Northern Expedition, serving as a brigade commander in the National Revolutionary Army. In 1927, after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, Ye Jianying issued a telegram opposing Chiang and joined the Communist Party of China. Under the Party's leadership, he participated in the Nanchang Uprising and led the Guangzhou Uprising. During the decade-long civil war, he fought on the battlefield, enduring countless hardships. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, he followed Comrade Zhou Enlai to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, engaging in united front work for the Party, until he returned to Yan'an in the spring of 1941.

		I first met Comrade Ye Jianying in the autumn of 1943. At that time, I was participating in the rectification movement at the Central Party School in Yan'an. One day, I went to the Military Commission Headquarters in Wangjiaping with Comrade Luo Ronghuan and met Comrade Ye Jianying. He was then serving as the Chief of Staff of the Military Commission and the Eighth Route Army. My first impression of him was that he was eloquent, sharp, humble, and approachable. Soon after, I visited Comrade Zhu De, the Commander-in-Chief, in Wangjiaping, and Comrade Ye Jianying was also present. From then on, we frequently met and conversed, gradually becoming familiar with each other, and our friendship deepened. I remember Comrade Ye Jianying saying at the time: "Although we became acquainted relatively late, we felt no stranger to each other upon meeting. The ancient saying goes, 'Those who share the same ideals and principles make good friends.' Our ideals today are revolutionary ideals, and our principles today are Marxist-Leninist principles. With these ideals and principles as our foundation, the friendship and camaraderie among comrades will stand the test of time." I nodded in agreement: "We, regardless of when we became acquainted, share the same ideals and beliefs, and thus we are always on the same wavelength."

		In December 1945, Comrade Ye Jianying flew to Chongqing to participate in the Political Consultative Conference as a representative of our Party and assisted Comrade Zhou Enlai in negotiating with the Kuomintang representatives on issues such as stopping military conflicts. In January 1946, after the establishment of the Military Adjustment Executive Committee, Comrade Ye Jianying, as a representative of our Party, went to Beijing to negotiate with Kuomintang representative Zheng Jiemin and American representative Ralph B. Johnson. This was a serious political struggle to expose the Kuomintang's war plots and strive for domestic peace. He did an excellent job.

		On April 8, 1946, I departed from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, passing through Beijing, and took a Military Adjustment Executive Committee plane to Yan'an. In Beijing, I discussed our respective work situations with Comrade Ye Jianying. I talked about the land reform issue, and he talked about the negotiation situation of the three-person small group in the Military Adjustment Executive Committee. On June 3, I returned from Yan'an and flew back through Beijing. Comrade Ye Jianying invited me to discuss the situation of the meeting in Yan'an. I shared with him the process of the "May 4th Directive" and the views on the situation I heard from Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Ye Jianying said: "After several months of exposure, the Kuomintang's plot of false peace and true war has become even more apparent to the world. The so-called 'neutrality' of the Americans has also been thoroughly exposed. It seems that a nationwide civil war is imminent. Our mission in the Military Adjustment Executive Committee will soon come to an end. At most, half a year, at least two or three months, we will have to withdraw."

		When I left Yan'an, Comrade Mao Zedong also told me: "The Kuomintang reactionaries want to wage a civil war, and we will respond in kind, seeing it through to the end." At the same time, he wrote a letter for me to bring back. The content of the letter was summarized as "training troops, production, and education." In other words, we must be prepared for everything, and as soon as the Kuomintang reactionaries provoke a civil war, we will launch a counterattack.

		(Three)
		In March 1947, after the Kuomintang's strategy of all-out offensive failed, they turned to launching a concentrated offensive on the liberated areas. The Party Central Committee decided to proactively withdraw from Yan'an, dividing the Central Committee and the Military Commission into two parts: Comrades Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi formed the Front Committee to lead the work of the Central Committee and stayed in Shaanxi; Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and others formed the Central Work Committee and went to Xibeipo Village, Pingchang County (now Ping Mountain County), Hebei Province, to complete the tasks entrusted by the Central Committee. Comrades Ye Jianying and Yang Shangkun, along with others, formed the rear logistics team, the Central Rear Committee, and moved to the Jinxi North region, overseeing the rear work of the Central Committee.

		That autumn, the Central Work Committee held a land work conference in Xibeipo. Comrades Ye Jianying and I both attended. The conference was chaired by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and the "Outline of the Land Law of China" was adopted. Comrade Ye Jianying gave a report on military issues. He emphasized the new strategic deployment of going to the outer lines for combat, addressing the idea among some comrades that they did not want to fight outwards. He explained why it was necessary to fight in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said: "Our strategic counterattack is not a spontaneous motive but is decided based on the laws of war development and the situation of the struggle. The fact has proven that once the Liu-Deng army went out, it made Chiang Kai-shek restless. If we did not go out, that would be exactly what Chiang Kai-shek dreamed of, and he would 'thank' us. Can we make such a historical mistake? He spoke well, and everyone was educated.

		In the first half of 1948, the Central Committee decided to establish the North China Bureau, North China Military Region, and North China People's Government. Comrade Dong Biwu served as the Chairman of the North China People's Government, and I served as the First Secretary of the North China Bureau (initially, Comrade Liu Shaoqi served concurrently). Comrade Nie Rongzhen served as the Commander of the North China Military Region, and I served as the Political Commissar. The development of the war required the training of a large number of military cadres. The Central Committee decided to establish the North China Military and Political University, with Comrade Ye Jianying serving as the President and Political Commissar, and Comrades Xiao Ke and Zhu Liangcai serving as Vice Presidents and Vice Political Commissars. After Comrade Ye Jianying took charge of the work of the North China Military and Political University, whenever there were important matters in the school, he would request the North China Bureau and the North China Military Region to discuss them, accepting the dual leadership of the Central Committee and the North China Bureau. In fact, we never discussed the school's affairs, only doing some logistical work within our capabilities. In the process of establishing the North China Military and Political University, we encountered some difficulties, such as the issue of school buildings, living conditions, etc. Whatever the North China Bureau and the North China Military Region could solve, we did our best to help solve. The only major problem was the faculty. There were thousands of students, but only about 30 military teachers who could stand on the podium. Comrade Ye Jianying said: "Not teaching while fighting is abandoning them, and not learning while teaching is harming them." A military school without a good faculty would mislead the students. Later, he came up with the idea of issuing a "wanted poster," quickly recruiting more than 200 teachers. Among them, many came from the old army, some had studied at military academies such as the Military Academy, Baoding Military Academy, Whampoa Military Academy, and Army University, some were military academy graduates from the United States, Japan, and Germany, and some had served as instructors in the Kuomintang army. How to view these people, should we dare to use these people? At that time, opinions were not unanimous. Some comrades believed that these people's backgrounds were complex and should not be easily employed. Comrade Ye Jianying disagreed with this view. He said: "After the October Revolution, Lenin had used the old military officers of the Tsarist army to establish the Army University, and it was a necessity for the revolutionary cause to use these high-level intellectuals left by the old army." We agreed with and supported Comrade Ye Jianying's views. Comrade Ye Jianying not only decisively used these people but also emphasized that in dealing with them, one must be politically equal, intellectually respectful, sincerely in attitude, and caring in life. He required all the cadres and staff of the entire school to "respect teachers and value education." He often had heart-to-heart talks with these teachers and made friends with them. It turned out that Comrade Ye Jianying's approach was completely correct and was a pioneering effort at that time. When Comrade Zhu De visited the school for an inspection, he highly praised it. Later, this batch of teachers played a significant role in the construction of our army. When Comrade Xiao Ke became the Director of the Training Department of the Military Commission, he transferred many of these professors from the North China Military and Political University to work. When the Training Supervision Department was established, Comrade Zhou Enlai specially instructed to transfer these experts to form an advisory room. Many professors of the Nanjing Military Academy and the Beijing Higher Military Academy also came from the North China Military and Political University. Before the founding of the nation, our Party had successful experiences in policies and work regarding intellectuals, but the problem was that after the founding of the nation, we did not fully summarize and combine these with new situations to persist and develop, resulting in many mistakes in the intellectual issue over the next 20 years. Therefore, learning correctly from historical experiences, promoting correct practices, and overcoming erroneous practices has always been an important topic in our leadership work.

		(Four)
		In mid-December 1948, the Party Central Committee decided that after the liberation of Beijing, Comrades Ye Jianying and Peng Zhen would be responsible for taking over Beijing. Comrade Peng Zhen served as the Secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Comrade Ye Jianying served as the Chairman of the Military Control Commission and Mayor. After receiving the order, Comrade Ye Jianying led a group of cadres to leave Shijiazhuang first and convened the first meeting of the Central Beijing Municipal Committee in Baoding. Subsequently, they arrived in Liangxiang, south of Beijing, and hurriedly prepared for the takeover.

		Shortly after the New Year of 1949, the Central Committee held a Political Bureau meeting in Xibeipo to discuss and adopt the resolution "Current Situation and the Party's Tasks in 1949." At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong was preparing the report for the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. He gave everyone a topic: what to do after entering the city? He asked for broad opinions. During the meeting, Comrade Ye Jianying and I, along with several other comrades, discussed this issue several times. I remember that the opinions that were discussed more and considered more important mainly included the following points:

		First, after entering the city, we must rely on the working class, unite other broad laboring masses and intellectuals, and strive to learn how to manage and build cities. We all believed that our Party is a Party that serves the people wholeheartedly. Any policy formulation must reflect the interests of the majority, and any policy implementation must rely on the united struggle of the majority. Detaching from the wishes and demands of the majority would make it difficult to move forward and achieve nothing. This is especially important to pay attention to after the success of the revolution.

		Second, after entering the city, we must always maintain political clarity and withstand the test of victory, and never become like Li Zicheng. Li Zicheng entered Beijing, and he and his subordinates were intoxicated with victory, quickly becoming corrupt, and failed after only 40 days as the "Emperor of the Great Order." Such a historical tragedy must not be repeated in the hands of communists. We all believed that we should take a good look at Guo Moruo's "Three Hundred Years of the Manchu Dynasty," and the key is to educate the broad masses of Party members to adhere to diligence and hard work, adhere to the mass line, and consciously accept the democratic supervision of the people.

		Third, to prevent arrogance and indulgence, we must strictly define systems and disciplines. We all believed that first, we must set some rules and abide by them, such as not inviting guests, not giving gifts, not celebrating birthdays, and not naming places after people. These seemingly trivial matters are of profound significance for maintaining the integrity and humility of the entire Party, especially the leading comrades.

		The opinions we discussed were approved by Comrade Mao Zedong. Later, some were written in the resolution of the meeting, and some were confirmed as regulations.

		Comrade Mao Zedong, when talking with Comrades Peng Zhen and Ye Jianying, repeatedly instructed: "Taking over Beijing has a significant impact both domestically and internationally. You must do a good job and do not make the 'leftist' mistakes made during the initial takeover of Shijiazhuang." He also said, "When taking over bureaucratic capital and national capital enterprises, we must take them over intact and unchanged, and deal with them slowly. It's okay to have more people; five people can eat three people's food!" It can be seen that at that time, starting from Comrade Mao Zedong, everyone was deeply thinking about how to take over the city well, very cautious in both thoughts and work, and very careful in summarizing experiences and lessons in practice.

		In January 1949, after the liberation of Beijing, Comrades Ye Jianying and Peng Zhen threw themselves into the busy work of taking over and urban construction. They united the broad masses of cadres and the people, established new government institutions, restored social order, maintained revolutionary order, strengthened political education, improved the sanitary environment, restored and developed production, and carried out various construction work. In executing the Party's policy on intellectuals, handling labor-capital relations in private enterprises, and stabilizing the market, they formulated a series of reasonable policies based on the actual situation at that time. I remember Comrade Ye Jianying once told me: "Now I am 'jumping into the water to learn swimming,' with no experience, just groping and learning. But there is one thing, we must be extremely careful and not the slightest careless. Especially after gaining some successful experiences, we must proceed humbly and never be arrogant and impulsive. Otherwise, we might choke on water or even drown." His words actually talked about the attitude we should have in learning from practice.

		(Five)
		In April and May 1952, I was dispatched by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong to Shanghai and Guangzhou to understand the situation of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. After arriving in Guangzhou, Comrade Ye Jianying invited me to give a report on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" issues at a cadre meeting.

		During my stay in Guangzhou, I heard that some comrades reflected that some leading comrades of the South China Bureau had localism tendencies in the use of cadres, and some even thought that Comrade Ye Jianying was the one leading the localism. Although Comrade Ye Jianying also mentioned this to me at that time, he did not want to talk much about it. I felt that there seemed to be something difficult to say, so I did not ask deeply. Before leaving, he asked me to report to the Central Committee and hoped that the Central Committee would send someone to investigate and clarify the facts.

		After returning to Beijing, I reported to Comrade Mao Zedong. He asked for my opinion, and I said: "Chairman, I am not very familiar with Comrade Ye Jianying's situation from the Central Soviet Area to now. I believe that after he went to Guangdong, he used the local cadres and outsider cadres fairly, and there was no issue of favoring one over the other. Saying that he led localism is not well-founded. I remember that when he left Beijing, he once told you that he took too few cadres with him, and it was definitely not enough to arrange. You said at that time, 'The tail of the water is the tail of the water, but there is a spring there,' meaning that local cadres are the source of the 'spring water.' Since the outsider cadres are not enough, of course, a large number of local cadres must be used, and the outsider cadres must also become 'local cadres' combined with local cadres. We cannot say that Ye Jianying is leading localism just because he is a Guangdong native and used Guangdong cadres. Moreover, according to my understanding, he proposed that we should not have 'five same'—same clan, same hometown, same school, same unit, and same age—and he firmly opposed the 'five same.' Comrade Mao Zedong agreed with my opinion.

		On June 12, Comrade Mao Zedong presided over a meeting in the Hall of Prolonged Happiness in Zhongnanhai to discuss the Guangdong issue. The meeting criticized the localism problem in Guangdong's work. But Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized in his speech that Comrade Ye Jianying had achievements in his work in South China and had no responsibility for this issue. He could not be said to be the leader of localism. Everyone should understand him. Of course, including Comrade Ye Jianying, all comrades in various places should draw lessons from this incident and prevent similar mistakes from happening again. Although so, Comrade Ye Jianying still made self-criticisms at the subsequent expanded meeting of the South China Bureau and took the responsibility of "not discovering in time." This shows that he is broad-minded and strict with himself.

		Now, the matter is very clear. At that time, the criticism of some comrades in Guangdong for their "localism error" had the tendency to simplify and exaggerate the problem. In the subsequent anti-rightist struggle, they were further criticized, fought against, and punished, which was incorrect. In August 1979, the Guangdong Provincial Committee reviewed this matter and wrote a report to the Central Committee. In October, the Central Committee replied, agreeing with the analysis of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, and corrected this matter.

		(Six)
		Comrade Ye Jianying has many virtues, but what impresses me the most is that he can always see clearly in major issues, make correct judgments and decisions without hesitation, and be wise and decisive. Those who know him have the same feeling.

		In the late 1950s, at a central work conference held in Beidaihe, Comrade Mao Zedong asked me to expand my speech at the small group meeting and give it again at the continuation of the conference in Beijing. When I mentioned "Wang Zuo cutting his arm to show his loyalty to the country, day and night busy" in an old play, several comrades interrupted, and Comrade Mao Zedong, referring to Comrade Ye Jianying's interruption, said: "I give you a sentence, 'Zhuge Liang's life was all about caution, Lü Duan was never confused in major matters.' Lü Duan was a prime minister during the Northern Song Dynasty, known for his clear vision and simplicity. The Song Emperor's poem 'Wanting to fish with a golden hook but not reaching, ask the fisherman of the river' was intended for Lü Duan." This "Lü Duan was never confused in major matters," I think Comrade Ye Jianying can be worthy of it. At that time, I did not quite understand, so I discussed with several comrades, what was this about? Later, I knew that Comrade Mao Zedong's words were mainly about Comrade Ye Jianying's struggle against Zhang Guotao's splitism during the Long March, and it was also related to Comrade Ye Jianying's speech at this conference. Incidentally, my speech at that time was not perfect and had errors.

		In 1976, Comrade Ye Jianying, in response to the hearts of the Party and the people, stood up and, together with Comrades Hua Guofeng and Li Xiannian, carefully planned and, with one stroke, smashed the "Gang of Four." In this struggle, he played a decisive role. At that time, I was still under "control," and when I heard that the "Gang of Four" had been smashed, I was overjoyed. This once again showed that Comrade Ye Jianying, as a proletarian politician, in the critical moment of the Party's life and death, was wise and decisive in major matters. Soon, Comrade Ye Jianying also strongly advocated for Comrade Deng Xiaoping to come out and participate in the leadership of the Party Central Committee, which were his important historical contributions to the Party and the people. Comrade Ye Jianying once wrote in a seven-character poem "Ink Bamboo":
		"In life, it is noble to have a bamboo in one's heart, to stand the test of hardship."

		I think this is also a portrayal of his life.

		(Seven)
		Comrade Ye Jianying is a person with rich emotions and values friendship highly. In 1979, after An Ziwen, Liu Lantao, and I were rehabilitated and released from prison, we went to Xishan to visit him. Although his body was not as good as before, his spirit was still vigorous, and he was still so enthusiastic and sincere. When he saw us, his first words were: "I didn't expect you to suffer so much!" He couldn't help but shed tears. When we parted, he sent us to the door and stood there until the car left. His deep affection is unforgettable.

		In 1982, before the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee sent me to report the personnel arrangement issues to the Central Committee members who were not in Beijing. At that time, Comrade Ye Jianying was resting in Songyuan, Guangzhou. When I had a face-to-face conversation with him, Comrade Wang Zhen was also present. Comrade Ye Jianying expressed his heartfelt support for the Central Committee's reform and opening-up policies and the opinions on personnel arrangements, and sincerely requested to step down, writing a letter to the Central Committee to further express this intention. He was already ill at that time, but he was still very concerned about the major affairs of the Party and the country.

		During the conversation, Comrade Ye Jianying recalled an old incident and laughed, saying to me: "Yibao, do you still remember? During the North China Bureau, there was once a disagreement on an issue, and you argued with Comrade Peng Zhen, and you were a bit stubborn! Decades have passed, and now you treat people and handle affairs so modestly, which is rare and worthy of my learning." I said, "Thank you for the encouragement, Comrade Ye. I have many flaws and hope for your guidance." He said, "I also have many flaws. Everyone will have shortcomings and mistakes, but the important thing is to be self-aware and correct them once recognized. 'To err is human, to forgive divine!' This is true for all ages. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party corrected many past mistakes, and the result was to win the hearts of the people. Why does the Party Constitution specially stipulate to carry out criticism and self-criticism? It is because we often make mistakes in our work. Otherwise, why have this clause? It is still the old saying we often say: to correct mistakes is not to fall; not to correct mistakes is to fall."

		In 1984, when Comrade Ye Jianying was critically ill, I went to Xishan to visit him again. He heard that I had come and opened his eyes slightly, wanting to speak but unable to. I felt very sad, knowing what he wanted to say. I held his hand and silently looked at him, and the past surged in my mind. After leaving the ward, I talked with his children about my feelings and impressions at that time. They took out paper and pen and asked me to write something. I remembered and wrote down two sentences from an article by Gao Yihan in 1927 mourning Comrade Li Dazhao (published in the "Central Daily" in Wuhan at that time). Unknowingly, it has become my eternal memorial to Comrade Ye Jianying:
		"He was generous to people, with a sense of chivalry;
		People were affectionate to him, with a sense of reverence."

    经得艰难考验时
    ——忆叶剑英同志
    薄一波
                              （一）
    叶剑英同志是我们党、国家和军队的一位久负盛誉的政治家和军事家，为中国人民的解放事业和社会主义事业贡献了毕生精力。他文武兼备，才行卓越，且工于诗词，素有“儒将”之称。
    剑英同志早岁因家境贫寒，为求生计，曾漂泊南洋。后归国就读于云南讲武堂，毕业以后，追随孙中山先生革命。他先后参加过筹办黄埔军校和东征北伐，当过国民革命军的师长。1927年蒋介石背叛革命后，他通电反蒋，毅然加入了中国共产党。在党的领导下，他参加策应南昌起义和领导广州起义。十年内战时期，他驰骋疆场，倍尝艰辛。抗日战争爆发后，他随周恩来同志奔走于国统区，从事党的统战工作，直到1941年春才回到延安。
    我与剑英同志第一次见面，是在1943年的秋天。那时，我在延安中央党校第一支部参加整风学习。一天，我和罗瑞卿同志去王家坪军委总部，见到了剑英同志。他当时担任军委参谋长和八路军参谋长。他给我的第一个印象是：谈吐文雅，精明谦逊，和蔼可亲。不久，我又去王家坪看望朱德总司令，剑英同志也在场。从此以后，我们不时见面、交谈，彼此渐渐熟悉，友谊也日益加深了。记得剑英同志当时说：我们虽然相识较晚，但见面一谈，却无陌生之感。古话说“志同道合，易为良友”。我们今日之“志”是革命之志，今日之“道”是马列之道，有这种“志”与“道”作基础，同志之间的相知与交情，就会经得起时间的考验。我颔首称是：我们这些人，不管相识早迟，有共同的理想、信念，因而总是一见如故的。
                                （二）
    1945年12月，剑英同志飞抵重庆，参加我党出席政协会议的代表团，并协助周恩来同志与国民党代表就停止军事冲突等问题进行会谈。1946年1月，军事调处执行部成立后，剑英同志作为我党代表去北平，同国民党代表郑介民、美国代表饶伯森进行三方谈判，并领导我党在军调部的机构的工作。这是一场揭露国民党反动派的内战阴谋、力争实现国内和平的严重政治斗争。他工作得很好。
    1946年4月8日，我从晋冀鲁豫区出发，途经北平，乘军调部飞机去延安。在北平时，与剑英同志相互谈了各自工作的情况。我讲的是土地改革问题，他讲的是军调部三人小组谈判情况。我于6月3日从延安回来又飞经北平。剑英同志约我谈谈在延安开会的情况，我把“五四指示”产生过程和从毛泽东同志那里听来的对时局的看法告诉了他。剑英同志说：经过几个月来的揭露，国民党假和平、真内战的阴谋更加大白于天下，美国人的所谓“中立”面貌，也已彻底拆穿。看来，全国内战已迫在眉睫，我们在军调部的使命很快就将结束，多则半年，少则两三月，我们就得撤退。
    在我离开延安时，毛泽东同志也向我说过：国民党反动派要打内战，我们就针锋相对，奉陪到底。同时，他写了一封信让我带回。信的内容概括起来就是“练兵、生产、教育”。也就是说，要作好一切准备，一俟国民党反动派挑起内战，我们就进行自卫反击。剑英同志所讲的精神与毛泽东同志是完全一致的。
                                （三）
    1947年3月，国民党全面进攻的策略破产之后，又转而对解放区实行重点进攻。党中央决定主动撤出延安，把中央和军委两大机关分成两部分：毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时同志组成前敌委员会，主持中央工作，留在陕北；刘少奇、朱德等同志组成中央工作委员会，前往河北省建屏县（今平山县）西柏坡村，完成中央委托的工作。叶剑英、杨尚昆等同志则组成后勤班子，即中央后方委员会，进驻晋西北临县地区，统筹中央的后方工作。
    这年秋天，中央工委在西柏坡召开党的土地工作会议。剑英同志和我都出席了。会议由少奇同志主持，通过了《中国土地法大纲》。剑英同志在会上作了军事问题的报告。他重点讲了到外线作战的新的战略部署，针对一些同志中存在的不想打出去的思想，阐明了为什么必须到蒋管区去作战的道理。他说：我们进行战略反攻，不是偶然的动机，而是根据战争发展的规律和斗争形势决定的。事实证明，刘、邓大军一打出去，就搞得蒋介石寝食不安。如果不打出去，那正是蒋介石梦寐以求的，人家就要“感谢”我们了。我们能犯这样的历史性错误么？他讲得很好，大家听了很受教育。
    1948年上半年，中央决定成立华北局、华北军区和华北人民政府。董必武同志任华北人民政府主席，我任华北局第一书记（开头由少奇同志兼任）。聂荣臻同志任华北军区司令员，我任政治委员。战争的发展需要培养大批军事干部，中央决定开办华北军政大学，由叶剑英同志任校长兼政治委员，肖克、朱良才同志任副校长、副政委。剑英同志主持华北军大工作以后，学校有什么重要事情总是要提请华北局、华北军区讨论，接受中央和华北局的双重领导，表现出他高度的组织纪律观念。其实，我们一次也没有讨论过学校的事，只不过是做了些力所能及的后勤工作。在创办华北军大的过程中，遇到一些困难，如校舍问题、生活问题等等。凡是华北局和华北军区能解决的，我们都尽量帮助解决。唯独教员是个大难题。学员几千人，而能够上讲台的军事教员只有30多个。剑英同志说：“不教而战是谓弃之，不学而教是谓害之。”一个军事学校没有好的教师队伍，那就要误人子弟。后来，他想出了一个发“招贤榜”的办法，很快就招聘到了二、三百名教员。其中不少是来自旧军队，有的曾就读于武备学堂、保定军校、黄埔军校、陆军大学等，有的是美国、日本、德国军事院校的留学生，还有的在国民党军队里担任过教官。如何看待这些人，要不要大胆使用这些人？当时，认识并不一致。有些同志认为，这些人情况复杂，不可轻易任用。剑英同志不同意这种看法。他说：列宁在十月革命后，就曾利用沙俄的旧军官创办陆军大学，善于使用这些旧军队留给我们的高级知识分子，是革命事业发展的需要。对于剑英同志这种观点我们是赞成和支持的。剑英同志不仅果断地使用这些人，而且强调对待他们，一要政治上平等，二要思想上尊重，三要态度上诚恳，四要生活上关心。他要求全校干部、职工，都要“尊师重教”。他还经常找这些教员促膝谈心，和他们交朋友。事实证明，剑英同志这样做是完全正确的，在当时是个创举。朱德同志来校视察时，曾经大加称颂。后来这批教员在我军的建设上起了很大作用。肖克同志到军委当训练部长时，就从华北军大调出不少这样的教授去工作。成立训练总监部时，周恩来同志曾特别指示，调这些专家组成参事室。南京军事学院、北京高等军事学院的不少教授也是从华北军大去的。建国前，我们党在对待知识分子的政策和工作上，并非没有成功的经验，问题是建国后未能充分总结，并结合新的情况加以坚持和发展，以致20多年内在知识分子问题上发生了不少失误。所以，善于从历史的经验中正确地学习，发扬正确的做法，克服错误的东西，始终是我们领导工作的一个重要课题。

    1948年12月中旬，党中央决定北平解放后，由叶剑英、彭真同志负责接管北平的工作。彭真同志任市委书记，剑英同志任军事管制委员会主任兼市长。受命以后，剑英同志带领一批干部从石家庄先期出发，在保定召开中央北平市委第一次会议。随后抵达北平城南的良乡，加紧做接管的准备工作。
    1949年元旦刚过，中央在西柏坡召开政治局会议，讨论并通过了《目前形势和党在一九四九年的任务》的决议。当时，毛泽东同志正准备七届二中全会的报告，他给大家出了一个题目，进城以后到底怎么办？要求广泛征求意见。会议期间，剑英同志和我还有其他几个同志，对于这个问题，分别吹过几次。记得谈得较多、而且认为比较重要的意见，主要有以下这么几条：
    第一条，进城以后，要依靠工人阶级，团结其他广大的劳动群众和知识分子，努力学会管理城市和建设城市。大家认为，我们党是全心全意为人民服务的党，任何政策的制定，都必须体现大多数人的利益，任何政策的实施，也必须依靠大多数人的团结奋斗。脱离大多数人的愿望和要求，就会举步维艰，一事无成。这一条在革命成功以后尤其要经常加以注意。
    第二条，进城以后，要始终保持政治上的清醒，经得起胜利的考验，千万不能做李自成。李自成进了北京，他和他的部下就是吃了陶醉于胜利的大亏，很快就腐化起来，结果只做了40天的“大顺皇帝”，就失败了。这样的历史悲剧绝不能在我们共产党人手里重演。大家认为要好好看看郭沫若同志写的《甲申三百年祭》，关键是要教育广大党员坚持励精图治、艰苦创业，坚持走群众路线，自觉接受人民的民主监督。
    第三条，为了防止居功骄傲、贪图享乐，一定要严定制度、严明纪律。大家认为，首先要约法几章，上下恪守，例如不请客，不送礼，不做寿，不以人名命地名等。这些事看似寻常，但对于保持全党特别是领导同志的清正廉明和谦虚谨慎，是有深远意义的。
    我们议论的这几条，得到了毛泽东同志的赞许。后来，在七届二中全会上，有的写在会议的决议中，有的作为规定确定了下来。
    毛泽东同志在和彭真、剑英同志谈话时，一再嘱咐：接管北平，影响中外，你们务必办好，不要犯接收石家庄初期的那些“左”的错误。他还说，接管官僚资本和民族资本企业都要原封原样、原封不动地接下来，慢慢处理，人多了不要紧，3个人的饭5个人吃嘛！可见，当时从毛泽东同志起，大家对于如何接管好城市，是反复思考，非常谨慎的，很注意在实践中及时总结经验教训，在思想上和工作上都是十分谨慎的。
    1949年1月，北平解放后，剑英、彭真同志投入了紧张的接管工作和市政建设。他们团结广大干部和群众，着手建立新的政权机构，整顿社会治安，维护革命秩序，加强政治教育，治理卫生环境，恢复和发展生产，开展各项建设工作。他们在执行党的知识分子政策，处理私营企业中的劳资关系，稳定市场等方面，都从当时的实际情况出发，制定了一系列合情合理的政策。记得剑英同志对我这样说过：我现在是“跳下水去学泅水”，没有经验，就摸索着学习。但有一条，必须慎之又慎，丝毫大意不得。尤其是在取得一些成功经验之后，更要虚心前行，切不可傲然躁进。否则就很可能呛水，甚至被淹死。他的这些话，实际上讲的是我们在实践中学习实践所应该持有的态度。
                              （五）
    1952年4、5月间，我受党中央和毛泽东同志派遣，先后到上海、广州等地了解“三反”、“五反”运动的情况。到广州后，剑英同志邀我就“三反”、“五反”问题在干部大会上作了一次报告。
    我在广州期间，听到有人反映华南分局一些领导同志在使用干部的问题上，存在地方主义倾向，有的甚至认为剑英同志是带头搞地方主义的。对于这件事，剑英同志虽然当时也和我谈起过，但他不愿多讲，我觉得其中似有难言之处，故未便深问。临别时，他要我向中央报告一下，希望中央派人调查，把事实弄清楚。
    回到北京，我向毛泽东同志作了汇报。他问我有什么看法，我说：主席，剑英同志的情况，从中央苏区到现在，我不十分了解。我认为，他去广东后，对南下干部和当地干部的使用是公正的，不存在厚此薄彼的问题，说他带头搞地方主义根据不大。记得他离开北京时，曾对主席说过，带去的干部太少了，肯定安排不过来，就像南方的“水尾田”，水流到那里就没有了。你当时说：“水尾田”是“水尾田”，但那里有一股清泉嘛，地方干部不就是源源而出的“泉水”吗？南下干部不够用，当然要使用一大批本地的干部，而且南下干部也要变成与本地干部相结合的“本地干部”。不能因为叶剑英是广东人，使用了广东干部，就说是搞地方主义。而且据我了解，他提出不能搞“同宗、同乡、同学、同事、同庚”，他是坚决反对这个“五同”的。毛泽东同志表示同意我的看法。
    6月12日，毛泽东同志主持在中南海颐年堂召开了一次讨论广东问题的会议。会上批评了广东工作中存在“地方主义”问题。但毛泽东同志在讲话中强调指出，叶剑英同志在华南工作是有成绩的，他对这个问题没有什么责任，更不能说他是搞地方主义的头头，大家要理解他。当然，包括剑英同志在内，各地的同志都应从这件事中总结教训，防止今后再发生此类错误。尽管这样，剑英同志在随后不久召开的华南分局扩大会议上，还是作了自我批评，承担了“未能及时发现”的领导责任。这说明他是胸怀豁达，严于责己的。
    现在，事情已经看得很清楚，当时批评广东一些同志的“地方主义错误”，存在着把问题简单化、扩大化的倾向，在后来的反右斗争中又对他们进行批判、斗争和处分，更是不正确的。1979年8月，广东省委对这一问题进行了复查，并向中央写了报告。10月，中央批复，同意广东省的分析意见，对此事进行了纠正。
                          （六）
    剑英同志有许多长处，最使我感佩的是，他在大是大非面前，总能洞若观火，毫不含糊，机智果敢地作出正确判断和决策。凡是了解他的人，对此都有同感。
    50年代末，在北戴河召开的一次中央工作会议上，毛泽东同志要我把小组会上的发言加以充实，在回北京继续召开的大会上再讲一次。当我讲到旧戏中王佐断臂“为国家尽忠心，昼夜奔忙”时，几位同志纷纷插话，毛泽东同志就着剑英同志的插话说：我送你一句话，“诸葛一生唯谨慎，吕端大事不糊涂”。吕端是北宋人，当过太宗朝的宰相，时人称之“识大体，以清简为务”。宋太宗所作的《钓鱼诗》“欲饵金钩殊未达，磻溪须问钓鱼人”，就是意以属端的。这“吕端大事不糊涂”，我看剑英同志可以当之无愧。当时我听了还不怎么理解，便和几个同志议论，这是指什么说的呢？后来才知道，毛泽东同志所说的这句话，主要是指剑英同志在长征途中同张国焘分裂主义作斗争的那件事，也联系到剑英同志在这次会议上的发言。顺便指出，我当时的发言并不完善，是有错误的。
    1976年，剑英同志顺应党心民心，挺身而出，同华国锋、李先念等同志一起，经过精心筹划，一举粉碎了“四人帮”。在这场斗争中，他是起了决定性作用的。那时，我还在被“管制”期中，得知“四人帮”被粉碎，心中大快。这再一次表现了剑英同志作为无产阶级政治家，在党的生死存亡的紧急关头，在大事面前的深谋睿智与精明果决。不久，剑英同志又力主请小平同志出来参加党中央的领导工作，这都是他为党和人民作出的重要历史贡献。剑英同志在一首《题画竹》的七绝中曾写道：
  “人生贵有胸中竹，经得艰难考验时。”我想，这也正是他一生的写照。
                            （七）
    剑英同志是个感情丰富、很重友谊的人。1979年，安子文、刘澜涛和我被平反出狱后，到西山去看他，虽然他身体大不如从前了，但精神矍铄，还是那样热情诚挚。他见到我们，第一句话就说：“想不到你们受这么许多苦！”不禁流下泪来。临别时，他送我们到门口，直到汽车离开了，他还伫立远望。殷殷之情，难以忘怀。
    1982年，党的十二大前夕，中央派我向不在京的中央常委同志汇报人事安排问题。当时剑英同志在广州的松园休养。我和他面谈时，王震同志也在座。剑英同志表示衷心拥护中央制定的改革、开放政策，拥护中央对人事安排的意见，同时诚心诚意地提出自己已经年迈，要求退下来，并给中央常委写了一封信进一步表达了这个意思。他当时已在病中，但对党和国家的大事仍极为关心。
    谈话中，剑英同志想起了一件往事，笑着对我说：一波，你还记得吧，在华北局的时候，有一次因为对一件事有些不同看法，你同彭真同志争论起来，可有点犟脾气咧！几十年过去了，你现在待人处事这样谦和，真是难得啊，值得我学习。我说，感谢叶帅的鼓励，我毛病不少，尚望随时指教。他说：我自己的毛病也不少。谁都会有缺点、过失，重要的是要自知，认识了就要改正。“过而能改，善莫大焉！”古今皆然。十一届三中全会以后，我们党纠正了过去的许多失误，结果是大得人心。党章中为什么要专门规定开展批评与自我批评，就是因为我们工作中常常会发生过错嘛，不然要这一条干什么？还是我们大家常说的那句老话：有错就改，塌不了台；有错不改，就难免塌台。
    1984年，剑英同志病危时，我再次到西山去看望。他听说我来了，眼睛微睁，欲语不能，我心里很难过，知道他想说些什么。我握着他的手，默默地望着他，悠悠往事涌上心头。走出病房，我和他的孩子们谈了当时的心情和感受。他们拿出纸笔，要我写点什么。我想起并写下了1927年高一涵先生写的悼李大钊同志一文中的两句话（载在当时武汉出版的《中央日报》上）。不料它已成为我对剑英同志的永久的纪念：
    他对人们，从浑厚中透出侠义气；
    人们对他，从亲爱中露出敬畏心。
