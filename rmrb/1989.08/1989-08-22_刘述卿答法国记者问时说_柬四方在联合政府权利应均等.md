Liu Shuqing, while answering questions from a French journalist, said that the Cambodian four parties should have equal rights in a coalition government.

PARIS, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- Liu Shuqing, deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, said in an interview with Jean-Claude Pomonti of the French newspaper Le Monde on Aug. 18 that China advocates a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue. This means that Vietnam should genuinely and completely withdraw its troops from Cambodia, and at the same time, a coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk should be established. Liu Shuqing quoted Prince Sihanouk as saying that in the coalition government, the four parties should have equal rights and that some people should not be allowed to sit on sofas while others sit on benches.

Regarding the solution to the Cambodian issue, Liu Shuqing pointed out that the first plan is the one proposed by Sihanouk, which involves forming a coalition government with Sihanouk as the chairman and the other three parties as vice-chairmen. The government departments would then be managed by the chairman and vice-chairmen respectively. The second plan is for Sihanouk and Hun Sen to form a coalition government, which essentially means that Hun Sen would be in power. It can be said that the French plan is essentially the Hun Sen plan. This plan is unreasonable and unjust, and it cannot be widely accepted.

Regarding the issue of military forces within Cambodia, Liu Shuqing said that China had proposed that after Vietnam genuinely and completely withdraws its troops, the four parties' armies should be frozen and reduced. The resistance forces had proposed that the armed forces of the four parties should each be reduced to 10,000. China has expressed support for this proposal by the resistance forces. At this Paris conference, the resistance forces have again proposed to disarm the military forces of the four parties, which will attract the interest of the participating countries.

Regarding the issue of Vietnamese withdrawal, Liu Shuqing said that he had recently told Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach that Vietnam's withdrawal of troops depends on its sincerity and actions, and there must also be an effective international supervision mechanism under the auspices of the United Nations. China supports the participation of the four Cambodian parties in supervision and verification. Nguyen Co Thach assured Liu Shuqing that Vietnam would not return to Cambodia. Liu Shuqing said that the key to solving the Cambodian issue lies with Vietnam.

Regarding the issue of military aid to the resistance forces, Liu Shuqing pointed out that only after Vietnam genuinely and completely withdraws its troops and a comprehensive agreement is reached on the Cambodian issue, will China stop military aid to the Cambodian resistance forces. Moreover, all countries should stop military aid to all factions.

Regarding the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, Liu Shuqing said that China hopes and only proposes one condition, that is, the Cambodian conflict must be genuinely resolved; otherwise, Sino-Vietnamese relations will be difficult to improve. China does not understand why Vietnam is not willing to quickly resolve the Cambodian issue. If Vietnam is sincere, it should accept the solution of forming a coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

Regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Cambodian issue, Liu Shuqing said that, as we proposed in February 1989, there are still some differences between China and the Soviet Union on certain issues regarding Cambodia. However, Soviet friends have told us that they are prepared to contribute to the resolution of the Cambodian issue, and we believe they will do so.

    刘述卿答法国记者问时说
    柬四方在联合政府权利应均等
    本报巴黎8月21日电　记者张启华报道：正在巴黎出席柬埔寨问题国际会议的中国代表团副团长刘述卿8月18日在接受法国《世界报》记者让—克洛德·波蒙迪采访时重申，中国主张全面解决柬埔寨问题，即越南应真正、全部地撤出它在柬埔寨的军队，同时成立一个以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。刘述卿引用西哈努克亲王的话说，在四方联合政府中，四方的权利应该是均等的，不能让一些人坐沙发，让另一些人坐板凳。
    关于解决柬埔寨问题的方案，刘述卿指出，第一个是西哈努克提出的方案，即组成四方联合政府，由西哈努克任主席，其它三方分别担任副主席，政府各部则分别由主席和副主席分管。第二个方案，是由西哈努克和洪森组成联合政府，实质上是由洪森一家掌权。人们可以说，法国的方案实质上是洪森方案。这个方案是不合理、不公正的，不可能被普遍接受。
    关于柬埔寨内部军事力量问题，刘述卿说，中国曾建议，在越南真正全部撤军后，四方军队实行冻结和裁减。抵抗力量曾提出，四方武装力量各自裁减到一万人。中国已表示支持抵抗力量这项建议。在这次巴黎会议上，抵抗力量又提出解除四方军队的全部武装，这将会引起与会国的兴趣。
    在谈到越南撤军问题时，刘述卿说，日前他对越南外长阮基石说过，越南撤军要靠它的诚意，并见诸于行动，同时，还必须有联合国主持的有效的国际监督机制。中国赞成柬埔寨四方都参加监督与核查。阮基石向刘述卿保证，越南不会重返柬埔寨。刘述卿说，解决柬埔寨问题的关键在越南。
    关于对抵抗力量的军事援助问题，刘述卿指出，只有在越南真正全部撤军、对柬埔寨问题达成全面解决协议之后，中国才会停止对柬埔寨抵抗力量的军事援助，而且所有国家对各派的军事援助都应该停止。
    在谈到中越关系正常化的问题时，刘述卿说，中国希望而且只提出唯一的一个条件，即柬埔寨冲突得到真正的解决，否则中越关系将很难得到改善。中国不明白，为什么越南不愿意尽快解决柬问题。如果越南真有诚意，他就应该接受组成以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府的解决办法。
    关于苏联对柬埔寨问题的态度，刘述卿说，如同我们1989年2月提出的那样，中苏在柬埔寨某些问题上还存在分歧。但苏联朋友对我们说，他们准备为解决柬问题做出贡献，我们相信他们会这样去做。
