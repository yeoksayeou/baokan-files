Cloth shoes, which were once neglected, have now become a hot item in the shoe market. At the semi-annual national shoe and hat trade fair held this year, 19.3 million pairs of cloth shoes were sold, an increase of 41.3% compared to the same period last year.

The once ubiquitous black cloth shoes have been replaced by a variety of colorful fabrics. The styles of cloth shoes have also increased to several hundred varieties. With their soft, comfortable, and affordable features, cloth shoes have become popular in both urban and rural areas, with sales far exceeding those of leather shoes and plastic shoes.

    布鞋如今又畅销
    新华社北京8月3日电  （记者李安定）一度被人们冷落的布鞋如今又成为鞋市场上的热门货。在今年下半年全国鞋帽商品交易会上，布鞋成交1930万双，比去年同期上升41.3％。
    清一色的黑布鞋已被五颜六色的面料所替代，布鞋的款式也已经多达数百种，加上柔软、舒适、价格便宜的特点，无论在城市还是农村，布鞋的销量都已远远超过皮鞋和塑料鞋。
