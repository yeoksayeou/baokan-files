In the fight against corruption, many citizens have taken action, sending letters to our newspaper to expose problems in various regions. Below, let us hear the voices from parts of Hunan province!

The Agricultural Commission of Loudi Region Sells Fertilizer Illegally and Exploits Farmers for Personal Gain

A reporter from the Hunan People's Radio Station's Loudi Bureau, Shen Xuejun, wrote: In mid-July, the Loudi Regional Supervision Bureau reported to the Hunan Provincial Supervision Bureau that last year, the Loudi Regional Agricultural Commission system illegally sold 1,293 tons of state-subsidized fertilizer, making a profit of over 160,000 yuan, with the regional commission itself profiting over 50,000 yuan.

Last April, the Provincial Agricultural Economic Commission allocated 1,000 tons of "agricultural supplementary fertilizer" to the Loudi Regional Agricultural Commission. The regional commission then distributed 890 tons to the five counties and cities under its jurisdiction, labeling it as "technical matching fertilizer." They instructed that each ton of urea be priced 200 yuan higher than the original 550 yuan. The county and city agricultural commissions, under the regional commission's instructions, competed to raise prices and sell the fertilizer illegally. Among them, the Loudi City Agricultural Commission handed over 150 tons of fertilizer to the Labor Service Company, selling each ton of urea for 960 yuan. This batch of fertilizer made a profit of 56,000 yuan. The county and city commissions, after "contributing" 22,000 yuan to the regional commission, mostly divided the rest among themselves or used it for banquets and gifts. Later, the Loudi Regional Agricultural Commission intercepted 532 tons of state-allocated, planned-price fertilizer in three batches, making a profit of nearly 25,000 yuan. The regional commission also accepted gifts through fertilizer allocation and even directly demanded resources from grassroots units. In August last year, Jinjia Township in Shuangfeng County obtained 32.5 tons of urea from the regional commission director Yuan Yuwu, who immediately demanded 500 kilograms.

The regional commission led the way in lawlessness, and some county and city commissions and districts and townships followed suit. Qingshuping District in Shuangfeng County obtained fertilizer from Yuan Yuwu eight times, totaling 64 tons, all of which were sold at a higher price, making a profit of 7,390 yuan, most of which was used for banquets and gifts. Sanjia Township in Lianyuan City, introduced by the city agricultural commission director Liang Juda, obtained 50 tons of urea and 40 tons of potash, making a profit of 21,918 yuan after reselling. Liang Juda took 10,000 yuan from this amount, gave 4,000 yuan to the regional commission, 1,000 yuan to the township party secretary (who immediately handed the money over to the township finance), 700 yuan to the deputy township head Liang Yubing, and kept 1,300 yuan for himself, with the remaining 3,000 yuan given to the Lianyuan City Agricultural Commission, distributing 200 yuan to each cadre.

The State Provides Relief Grain for Disaster-Stricken Farmers, but Township Leaders Embezzle It, Which Is Unacceptable

Yang Kede from the Hunan Yiyang Daily wrote: Last autumn, Langba Lake Township in the Dongting Lake area suffered severe natural disasters, and farmers faced difficulties. The state allocated 250,000 jin of relief grain to this township. In December last year, the township party committee secretary and township head presided over a meeting of township party and government leaders, deciding to first sell 90,000 jin of state-mandated grain turned over by villagers to the grain station at a negotiated price. Then, they used 250,000 jin of relief grain to offset the state-mandated grain task (this township owed the state 247,000 jin of grain). This manipulation made a profit of 344,000 yuan, all of which was added to the township's financial income. Additionally, the township distributed 3,700 jin of relief grain to township government officials and the government canteen, which are not relief recipients.

This incident had a very bad impact locally and was investigated in June this year. The party committee secretary and township head of Langba Lake Township both received serious party disciplinary warnings.

Layer by Layer, Grain Pre-purchase Deposits Are Withheld, and the People of Qinglonggang Village Are Full of Complaints

Liu Lejin from the Rural Survey Team of the Statistics Bureau of Tongcheng District, Changde City, wrote: This year, the grain store in Shimen Bridge Township of Tongcheng District, Changde City, allocated 23,360 yuan in grain pre-purchase deposits to Qinglonggang Village, but only 2,654 yuan actually reached the farmers, accounting for 11.4% of the total. Where did the remaining 20,000 yuan go? See below:

The township government and its subordinate units withheld 11,332 yuan, accounting for 48.4% of the pre-purchase deposit total. Among them, the township government deducted 5,650 yuan in national bonds and 400 yuan in meal fees for village cadres attending meetings in the township; the water conservancy department deducted 5,282 yuan in water fees and water conservancy project fees.

The village committee misappropriated 5,204 yuan, accounting for 22.4% of the pre-purchase deposit total. Among them, 3,150 yuan was used to supplement disaster relief funds; 310 yuan was used for school repairs and military dependents' welfare; 400 yuan was used to repay debts; and other expenses amounted to 1,344 yuan.

4,170 yuan was paid as wages to village and group cadres, accounting for 17.8% of the pre-purchase deposit total. Among them, 3,270 yuan was for village cadre wages; 900 yuan was for group leader wages.

Layer by layer, the grain pre-purchase deposits were withheld, misappropriated, and occupied, dampening the farmers' enthusiasm for grain production.

According to a sample survey of nine farmer households in this village, they should have received 649 yuan in grain pre-purchase deposits, but in reality, they only received 80 yuan. Therefore, these households invested 7.2% less in grain production in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. At the same time, it increased the difficulty of completing the grain procurement task, and some people even said they would resist completing this year's grain procurement task.

    坑农实录
    按：在惩治腐败的斗争中，许多群众积极行动起来，纷纷向本报写信，揭露各地工作中存在的问题。下边，就让我们听听来自湖南部分地区的声音吧！
    娄底地区农委倒卖化肥  盘剥农民谋取不义之财
    湖南人民广播电台驻娄底记者站申学军来信：7月中旬，娄底地区监察局向湖南省监察局报告，去年，娄底地区农委系统共倒卖国家下拨平价化肥指标1293吨，牟取差价款16万多元，其中地区农委牟利5万多元。
    去年4月，省农经委分配给娄底地区农委“农用补助肥”1000吨。地区农委随即以
  “技术配套肥”的名义分配给所属5个县、市农委890吨。他们布置每吨尿素在原来550元的基础上加价200元。县、市农委在地区农委授意下，竞相加价倒卖。其中娄底市农委将分到的150吨化肥交给劳动服务公司，每吨尿素售价高达960元。这批化肥共得差价款5.6万元。各县、市农委除向地区农委“进贡”2.2万元以外，其余大多被私分或用于请客送礼。后来，娄底地区农委又先后3次将省里分配的计划内平价化肥截留532吨，从中牟利近2.5万元。地区农委还通过批化肥收受礼物，甚至直接伸手向基层单位索要物资。去年8月，双峰县金家乡从地区农委主任袁裕文手中批得尿素32.5吨，袁裕文当即就索要了500公斤。
    地区农委带头违法乱纪，有的县、市农委和区、乡纷纷仿效。双峰县青树坪区先后8次从袁裕文手中批得化肥64吨，全部加价倒卖，共得差价款7390元，其中5000多元用于请客送礼。涟源市三甲乡经市农委主任梁巨大介绍，批得尿素50吨，钾肥40吨，倒卖后共得差价款21918元。梁巨大从这笔款中提取10000元，送给地区农委4000元、乡党委书记1000元（这位书记当即将钱上交了乡财政）、副乡长梁玉冰700元，梁巨大私吞1300元，其余3000元交涟源市农委，发给每个干部200元。
    国家调粮救济灾民有盼  乡领导人侵吞情理难容
    湖南益阳报社杨珂德来信：去年秋季，地处洞庭湖区的浪拔湖乡遭受严重自然灾害，农民生活遇到困难。为此国家给这个乡拨来25万斤救济粮。去年12月，乡党委书记和乡长主持召开乡党政负责人会，决定先将村民上交的国家定购粮9万公斤转为议价卖给粮站。然后用25万公斤救灾粮列抵国家定购任务（这个乡共欠国家定购粮24.7万公斤）。这样一倒腾，共得差价款3.44余万元，全部作了乡财政收入。此外，这个乡还将3700多公斤救灾粮发给乡机关干部和机关食堂等非救灾对象。
    这件事在当地影响非常坏，今年6月被查处后，浪拔湖乡党委书记、乡长均受到党内严重警告处分。
    层层截留粮食预购定金  青龙岗村群众怨声载道
    湖南常德市鼎城区统计局农村调查队刘乐进来信：今年，常德市鼎城区石门桥镇粮店拨给青龙岗村粮食预购定金23360元，而真正到农民手中的仅2654元，占总数的11.4％。其余2万多元到哪里去了呢？请看：
    镇政府和所属单位截留了11332元，占预购定金总数的48.4％。其中镇政府扣国库券5650元，扣村干部在镇开会的伙食费400元；水利部门的水费和水利工程费5282元。
    村委会挪用5204元，占预购定金总数的22.4％。其中补发救灾款3150元；维修学校和军属优扶费310元；偿还欠款400元；其他开支1344元。
    发给村组干部工资4170元，占预购定金总数的17.8％。其中村干部工资3270元；村民小组组长工资900元。
    层层截留、挪用、占用粮食预购定金，挫伤了农民生产粮食的积极性。
    据对这个村9户农民家庭的抽样调查，他们应得粮食预购定金649元，但是，实际上只得到80元，因此，这些户今年上半年投入粮食生产的资金，比去年同期少7.2％。与此同时，还增大了完成定购粮上交任务的难度，有些人还声言，要抵制完成今年的定购粮交售任务。
