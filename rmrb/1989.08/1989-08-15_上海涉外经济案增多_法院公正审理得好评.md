Shanghai courts have handled 80 foreign economic dispute cases in the past three years. Throughout the trial process, they have treated Chinese and foreign parties equally, earning international recognition and praise.

With the reform and opening up, Shanghai's foreign economic exchanges have become increasingly frequent, leading to a yearly increase in foreign economic dispute cases. These cases involve more than 20 countries and regions, including some where both parties are foreign entities. The Japanese company Nippon-Yu European Container Transport issued a bill of lading before the goods were loaded onto the ship, but the goods were delayed by more than a month before arriving in Fuzhou, causing severe economic losses to the Ningde Company in Fujian. Ningde Company sued Nippon-Yu in the Shanghai Maritime Court. The Shanghai Higher People's Court made a final judgment, ordering Nippon-Yu to compensate Ningde Company with 80 million yen and 1.2 million yuan.

Foreign parties generally find Shanghai courts' judgments reasonable and legal, and are willing to take responsibility.

    上海涉外经济案增多  法院公正审理得好评
    本报上海8月15日电　上海法院近三年来审理涉外经济纠纷案80件。在审理过程中，他们对中外当事人一视同仁，在国际上获得信誉和好评。
    随着改革开放，上海对外经济往来日益频繁，涉外经济纠纷案逐年增多。这些案件涉及20多个国家和地区，其中也有双方均为外国当事人的案件。日本日欧集装箱运输公司在货物未装船前即签发装船提单，而货物误期一个多月才运到福州，造成福建宁德公司严重经济损失。宁德公司向上海海事法院起诉。上海最高人民法院作出终审判决，判令日欧公司向宁德公司赔偿了800万日元及人民币120万元。
    国外当事人对上海法院的判决一般都感到合理合法，因而愿意承担责任。
