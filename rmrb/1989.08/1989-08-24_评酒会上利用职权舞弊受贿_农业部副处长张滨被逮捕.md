    Official Arrested for Bribery During Wine Evaluation

    Recently, the State Supervision Department, in collaboration with the Supervision Office stationed at the Ministry of Agriculture, investigated a case where Zhang Bin, former deputy director of the Enterprise Division of the Planning Department at the Ministry of Agriculture, accepted bribes during a wine evaluation event. Zhang Bin has been arrested by the Procuratorate of Chaoyang District, Beijing, for the crime of bribery.

    The Daozhen Wine Factory in Daozhen County, Guizhou Province, is a county-level collective enterprise. To have its products rated as "Ministry-Level Excellent," the factory established contacts with Zhang Bin, who oversaw the wine evaluation work at the Ministry of Agriculture, through various channels as early as January 1988. To enable its low-alcohol white wine, "Yinshan Xiang Jiao Jiu," to participate in the national agricultural system's low-alcohol wine evaluation event held by the Ministry of Agriculture in May 1988, the factory sent a case of 6-bottle Maotai wine to Zhang Bin and another individual. In exchange, Zhang Bin provided two application forms for the evaluation, allowing the low-alcohol wine "Yinshan Xiang Jiao Jiu," which did not meet the evaluation criteria, to obtain the qualification to participate in the low-alcohol wine evaluation.

    During the wine evaluation event, Zhang Bin accepted another bribe from the factory, amounting to 5,000 yuan in cash and a case of 12-bottle Maotai wine. After the wine was rated as "Ministry-Level Excellent," to express gratitude for Zhang Bin's "help," the Daozhen Wine Factory sent another 2,000 yuan in cash and 10 bottles of Maotai wine, all of which Zhang Bin accepted. According to statistics, Zhang Bin accepted bribes totaling over 10,000 yuan during this wine evaluation event, including 7,000 yuan in cash, 28 bottles of Maotai wine, and other items. Meanwhile, the Daozhen Wine Factory, which had been involved in bribery, was facing severe financial difficulties due to poor management and was on the brink of bankruptcy. Despite this, the factory spent nearly 80,000 yuan on organizing a "press conference" in Beijing and participating in the wine evaluation, purchasing 1,330 bottles of Maotai wine solely for gifts.

    As a state official, Zhang Bin abused his power, engaged in corruption, and severely damaged the image of state organs and social ethics. The nature of his actions is extremely serious.

    It is understood that this case involves other units and individuals who share irresponsible blame for the transaction. Currently, the State Supervision Department is further investigating and verifying the case and will deal with the relevant personnel seriously.

    评酒会上利用职权舞弊受贿
    农业部副处长张滨被逮捕
    本报讯　最近，国家监察部会同驻农业部监察局，对农业部原计划司企业处副处长张滨借评酒之机，收受贵州省道真县道真酒厂贿赂一案进行了调查。张滨因构成受贿罪已被北京市朝阳区人民检察院批准逮捕。
    贵州省道真县道真酒厂是一家县办集体企业，为了使其产品评上部优，该厂早在1988年1月，就通过各种渠道与农业部主管酒类评优工作的张滨拉上了关系，为了使该厂生产的低度白酒“银山乡窖酒”能够参加1988年5月农业部召开的全国农业系统低度酒的评优活动，该厂送给张滨和另外一个人各一箱6瓶装的茅台酒，从张滨那里换取了两张参评申请表，使本不符合参评条件的低度酒“银山乡窖酒”取得了低度酒参评资格。
    在评酒会期间，张滨又接受了该厂的贿赂5000元现金和一箱12瓶装的茅台酒。被评上“部优”称号之后，为了感谢张滨的“帮助”，道真酒厂又送给张滨现金2000元，茅台酒10瓶，张滨皆照收不误。据统计，张滨在这次评酒活动中，共接受道真酒厂的贿赂价值1万元以上，其中包括现金7000元，茅台酒28瓶，还有其它物品。而作为行贿一方的道真酒厂却由于经营不善，管理混乱，到今年6月，竟亏损400多万元，资金困难到连发货的运费都难以筹措，濒临倒闭的境地。就是在这种境遇下，道真酒厂却不惜血本，在北京组织“新闻发布会”和参加评酒这两项活动，竟花费近8万元，其中仅购买送礼的茅台酒就达1330瓶。作为国家机关干部的张滨，利用职权，贪赃舞弊，严重损害了国家机关形象，败坏了社会风气，性质是极为严重的。
    据了解，在这起案件中，还牵涉到其它一些单位和个人，他们对促成这起交易负有不可推卸的责任。目前，监察部正对此案做进一步调查核实，对有关人员将给予严肃处理。
