Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 7th.

From July 31st to August 6th, the skies over Changchun were scorched by the sun, with not a single cloud in sight. The residents of this northern city, who are more accustomed to cold than heat, experienced an unprecedented heatwave.

Meteorological authorities attributed the heatwave to the influence of a typhoon moving north from the sea, affecting the stable continental high-pressure system. The outdoor temperature reached a high of 34 degrees Celsius, while indoor temperatures soared to 32-33 degrees Celsius. The average daily temperature was 3-4 degrees Celsius higher than the same period in previous years.

People sought various ways to beat the heat. The few swimming pools in the city were packed every day. Once the sun set, people flocked to the streets and squares to cool off, with crowds several times larger than usual, lingering until late at night. Meteorological authorities forecasted that after the autumnal equinox, the weather would turn cloudy, and temperatures were expected to drop.

    热浪袭击长春
    据新华社长春8月7日电　（记者辛明华）从7月31日至8月6日，长春的上空，骄阳似火，没有一片云。怕热不怕冷的北国长春市民经受了罕见的热浪袭击。
    气象部门说，热浪是由于稳定的大陆暖高气压受海上台风北上的影响造成的。室外最高气温达34摄氏度，室内也高达32至33摄氏度。日平均气温比历年同期高出3—4摄氏度。
    人们想方设法避暑。市内仅有的几处游泳场所天天爆满。太阳一落，到马路边、广场上纳凉的人比平日多几倍，深夜不散。气象部门预报，立秋后将出现多云天气，气温可望下降。
