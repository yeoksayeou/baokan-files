	Jiangsu has launched a special inspection of individual business tax collections, and by the end of July, the amount of tax recovered had reached 140 million yuan.

	Through this special inspection of individual business tax collections, Jiangsu has discovered that some individual business owners have been able to amass wealth in a short period of time, often through tax evasion. Some individual business owners have openly stated, "To get rich, evade taxes," and "Get rich without paying taxes, pay taxes and don't get rich." The tax evasion behavior of individual business households is particularly serious. First, the evasion rate is over 80%; second, the amounts are large, with over 880 households having to pay back and be fined more than 100,000 yuan each, with the largest amount evaded reaching 578,000 yuan; third, the methods of evasion are varied, mainly including hiding actual business income, operating without a license, off-the-books operations, issuing fake invoices, selling wholesale under the guise of retail, and operating individually under the guise of collective ownership.

	The special inspection, which began in mid-May, also revealed that another reason for the wealth of some individual business owners is that they bribe officials at various levels, such as procurement, transportation, processing, and sales, to benefit themselves. During the inspection, some individual business owners, to avoid inspection and punishment, gave tax inspectors expensive cigarettes and alcohol, while others directly bribed them with cash. Some unlicensed cigarette vendors used walkie-talkies to tip each other off to avoid inspections.

	Jiangsu's special inspection of individual business tax collections has sparked widespread social reactions and boosted public confidence in rectifying economic order. Many law-abiding individual business owners also said the inspection was well done.

    “要想发，税上刮”行不通了
    江苏对个体户专项检查  两月补收税款一点四亿
    本报南京8月4日电　记者龚永泉报道：江苏开展个体工商税收专项检查，截至7月底，查补税款的数额已达1.4亿元。
    江苏通过个体工商税收专项检查发现，一些个体户所以能在较短的时期内暴富，往往同偷税漏税分不开。对此，有的个体户直言不讳：“要想发，税上刮”、“发财不纳税，纳税不发财”。个体工商户偷漏税行为尤其严重，一是偷漏税面占80％以上；二是数额大，查出补罚税款在万元以上的有880多户，其中最大一户偷税款达57.8万元；三是偷税手法多样，主要有隐瞒实际经营收入、无证经营、帐外经营、开假发票、明零售暗批发、名为集体性质实为个体经营等。
    5月中旬开始的这次专项检查还表明，一些个体工商户暴富的另一个原因是，在采购、运输、加工、销售等环节上拉拢腐蚀一些干部为其谋利。在检查中，有的个体工商户为逃避检查和处罚，给税务检查人员送名烟名酒，有的则直接用现金贿赂。有的无证贩烟户用无线电对讲机通风报信对付检查。
    江苏开展个体工商税收专项检查，引起了社会上广泛的反响，增加了人民群众对整顿经济秩序的信心。许多依法纳税的个体户也说检查得好。
