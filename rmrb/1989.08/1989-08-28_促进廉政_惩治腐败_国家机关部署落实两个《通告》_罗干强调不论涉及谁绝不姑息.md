Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 28th.

The Party Committee of State Organs and the General Office of the State Council held a meeting this afternoon in Zhongnanhai to study, mobilize, and deploy the implementation of the "Announcement by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the Requirement for Those Involved in Crimes of Embezzlement, Bribery, and Speculative Trading to Surrender and Confess Within a Specified Period" and the "Announcement by the State Bureau of Supervision on the Requirement for State Administrative Personnel Involved in Embezzlement and Bribery to Voluntarily Confess Within a Specified Period."

Relevant leaders from various departments of state organs attended the meeting.

Luogang, Secretary-General of the State Council, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. He said that seriously and strictly handling cases of embezzlement, bribery, corruption, and speculative trading, especially major cases, is an important task set by the Party Central Committee and the State Council for the near-term fight against corruption. The two announcements are important measures to achieve this task. It is of particular importance for state organs to take the lead in this work. The State Council is the highest administrative organ of our country, and whether the various ministries and commissions under the State Council are clean and whether the fight against corruption is resolute and thorough have a crucial impact on local governments and the entire country.

He emphasized that we must correctly understand the importance of implementing the two announcements in state organs and their relationship with the fight against corruption. We must fully recognize the particular practical significance of implementing the two announcements in our state organs. As long as we resolutely implement the deployment and requirements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, overcome obstacles, and remove barriers, we will definitely win this battle.

Luogang pointed out that to implement the two announcements, we need to clarify some ambiguous understandings among some comrades. One is the "inevitability of corruption" theory; the other is the "corruption is hard to eradicate" theory. This time, we are serious. No matter who is involved, we will deal with as many criminals as there are, and handle as many disciplinary cases as there are, without any leniency.

He said that our state organs are generally clean or basically clean, and the vast majority of personnel in each department can uphold the law and maintain integrity. Many examples of clean governance have emerged within our ranks. At the same time, we must be soberly aware that there are indeed serious corruption issues among our state organ personnel. The most prominent manifestations are numerous cases of embezzlement, bribery, and abuse of power, with large amounts of money involved and rapid development. Some people have seriously violated party discipline and administrative regulations, and a few have even become criminals. These situations indicate that our state organs are not all clean. The problems that have been initially exposed are quite serious, and some problems are still being concealed for various reasons. We must also see that in recent years, these corrupt practices have not only not been curbed but have shown a tendency to spread. Corruption is seriously eroding our healthy body and threatening our survival. If we do not take decisive measures, the consequences will be unimaginable. The fundamental purpose of the Communist Party and the people's government is to serve the people wholeheartedly. We cannot ignore or allow such ugly phenomena to continue. Therefore, implementing the two announcements in our state organs is not only necessary but also an urgent task.

Luogang demanded that to resolutely implement the two announcements, the leaders of various levels, especially the party and government leaders of each ministry and commission, must attach great importance to this. Each ministry and commission should designate relevant internal institutions to handle the reception of surrenders and reports. We must strengthen our policy awareness and strictly follow the regulations of the announcements. Through our propaganda, we must create a strong momentum to have a strong deterrent effect on those who violate discipline and commit crimes and an inspiring effect on the general public. At the same time, we must also combine investigation and prevention, making each department truly a clean, efficient, and law-abiding organ.

    促进廉政　惩治腐败
    国家机关部署落实两个《通告》
    罗干强调不论涉及谁绝不姑息
    新华社北京8月28日电（记者何平）国家机关党工委和国务院办公厅今天下午在中南海共同召开会议，研究动员部署落实最高人民法院、最高人民检察院《关于贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪分子必须在限期内自首坦白的通告》和国家监察部《关于有贪污贿赂行为的国家行政机关工作人员必须在限期内主动交代问题的通告》。
    国家机关各部门的有关负责同志出席了会议。
    国务院秘书长罗干主持会议并讲话。他说，严肃认真地查处贪污、受贿行贿、投机倒把等犯罪案件，特别是查处大案要案，是党中央、国务院确定的近期惩治腐败的一项重要任务。两个《通告》是实现这一任务的重要措施。我们国家机关各部门带头做好这项工作，具有特别重要的意义。国务院是我国最高行政机关，作为国务院组成部分的各部委是否廉洁，惩治腐败是否坚决彻底，对地方各级政府以至全国都有举足轻重的影响。
    他强调，要正确理解在国家机关中落实两个《通告》的重要性及其与惩治腐败的关系，要充分认识到在我们国家机关落实两个《通告》具有特别重要的现实意义。只要我们坚决贯彻党中央、国务院的部署和要求，克服阻力，排除障碍，就一定能取得这场斗争的胜利。
    罗干指出，落实两个《通告》，需要澄清在一些同志中存在的模糊认识，一是“腐败难免论”；另一个是“腐败难除论”。我们这次就是要动真格的，不论涉及到谁，有多少罪犯就法办多少，有多少违纪的就处理多少，绝不姑息。
    他说，我们的国家机关从总体上讲是廉洁的或基本廉洁的，各部门的绝大多数工作人员能够做到奉公守法、廉洁自律。在我们的队伍中涌现出了许多为政清廉的事迹。同时，我们也必须清醒地看到，在我们国家机关工作人员中确实也存在严重的腐败现象。突出表现是贪污受贿、以权谋私等案件多、数额大、发展快，有些人严重违犯了党纪和政纪，少数人也已经堕落为犯罪分子。这些情况表明，我们国家机关并不都是清水衙门，已经初步揭露的，有的问题是相当严重的，有些问题由于种种原因还被掩盖着。还必须看到，近几年来，这些腐败现象非但没有被扼制，反而有不断蔓延的势头。腐败之风正严重地侵蚀着我们健康的肌体，威胁着我们的生存。再不采取坚决措施，后果是不堪设想的。我们共产党人和人民政府的根本宗旨，是全心全意为人民服务。对这些触目惊心的贪污腐败现象，我们绝不能等闲视之，绝不能允许这种丑恶现象再继续存在下去。因此，在我们国家机关落实两个《通告》不仅是必要的，而且是一项紧迫的任务。
    罗干要求，为了坚决贯彻落实两个《通告》，我们国家机关各部门的各级领导特别是部委党政领导同志一定要充分重视，各部委要指定内部的有关机构做好接待自首和举报工作。要加强政策观念，严格按《通告》的规定办事。要通过我们的宣传，造成强大的声势，对违纪者和犯罪者产生强大的震慑作用，对广大群众产生鼓舞作用。同时，还要把查处与预防有机地结合起来，使各部门真正成为廉洁、高效、遵纪守法的机关。
