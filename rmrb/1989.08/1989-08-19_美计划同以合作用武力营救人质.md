Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 18th.

The U.S. plans to cooperate with Israel to take military action to rescue Western hostages being held in Beirut, according to informed sources quoted by Egypt's *Al-Ahram* newspaper today.

These sources said that the plan was drafted by the U.S. National Security Agency based on intelligence gathered by the Central Intelligence Agency in cooperation with Israel.

They pointed out that the intelligence has identified the possible locations where the hostages are being held, as well as the security conditions and the military strength of Muslim armed groups in those areas. Among the 16 Westerners, half are Americans.

The report said that Israel has expressed its willingness to assist the U.S. in rescuing the hostages, but the U.S. has refused to allow Israel to participate in the military operation, only requesting that it provide necessary intelligence.

The report said that the plan has been submitted to U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. If diplomatic efforts fail, the U.S. may take military action.

    美计划同以合作用武力营救人质
    新华社开罗8月18日电　据埃及《瓦夫德》报今天援引消息灵通人士的话报道，美国计划同以色列合作，采取军事行动解救被关押在贝鲁特的西方人质。
    这些人士说，这一计划是美国国家安全局在中央情报局同以色列合作搜集到的情报的基础上拟订的。
    他们指出，这些情报确定了这些人质可能关押的地点，以及这些地点的安全状况和穆斯林武装在那里的军力配备等。在16名西方人士中有一半是美国人。
    报道说，以色列表示愿意协助美国营救人质，但美国拒绝让以色列参加营救人质的军事行动，只要求它提供必要的情报。
    报道说，这项计划已提交给美国总统布什和国防部长理查德·切尼，一旦外交努力失败，美国就可能采取军事行动。
