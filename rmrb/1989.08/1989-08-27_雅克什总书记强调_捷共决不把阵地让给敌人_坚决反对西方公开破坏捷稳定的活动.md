    General Secretary Jakesh Emphasizes:
    The Czechoslovak Communist Party Will Not Yield Ground to the Enemy
    Resolutely Opposes Western Activities to Sabotage Czechoslovak Stability

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 26

    General Secretary Jakesh of the Czechoslovak Communist Party stated on August 26 that the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the National Front, and the working people will never yield their positions to the enemies of socialism.

    Jakesh made these remarks at a mass rally in Banska Bystrica to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising.

    Jakesh said that the goal of Czechoslovakia's reforms is to ensure the further development of socialism, and to guarantee the stability of people's lives on the basis of social justice, socialist democracy, and the unity of citizens' rights and duties, discipline, and order. He emphasized that "weakening the leading role of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the National Front, and the people's government, restoring private ownership of the economy, and unemployment" are "not the goals that Czechoslovakia's reforms aim to achieve, now or in the future." He said that Czechoslovakia will not allow this, because it would fundamentally threaten socialism.

    He reiterated that domestic hostile forces will not be allowed to engage in anti-socialist activities, and firmly opposes Western public activities to sabotage Czechoslovakia's socialist stability.

    He condemned some foreign tourists for participating in the demonstrations in Prague on August 21.

    Jakesh said, "We support the Polish communists and all forces advocating socialism in their struggle to ensure the socialist development of Poland. This is in the interest of the Polish working people, beneficial to the development of mutual relations between our two countries, and conducive to the stability of Europe."

    雅克什总书记强调
    捷共决不把阵地让给敌人
    坚决反对西方公开破坏捷稳定的活动
    新华社布拉格8月26日电  捷共中央总书记雅克什26日指出，捷克斯洛伐克共产党、民族阵线和劳动人民决不会把自己的阵地让给社会主义的敌人。
    雅克什是在班斯卡—比斯特里察举行的庆祝斯洛伐克民族起义45周年群众集会上讲这番话的。
    雅克什说，捷改革的目标是确保社会主义进一步发展，在社会公正、社会主义民主和公民权利与义务、纪律和秩序统一的基础上，确保人民生活的安定。他强调，“削弱捷克斯洛伐克共产党、民族阵线和人民政权的领导作用，恢复经济的私有制和失业”，“现在和将来都不是捷改革要实现的目标”。他说，捷不允许这样做，因为这会从根本上威胁社会主义。
    他重申，决不允许国内一些敌对势力进行反对社会主义的活动，并坚决反对西方公开进行破坏捷社会主义稳定的活动。
    他谴责了一些外国旅游者参加今年8月21日布拉格的示威活动。
    雅克什说，“我们声援波兰共产党人和所有拥护社会主义的力量为确保波兰的社会主义发展所进行的斗争。这符合波兰劳动人民的利益，有利于发展我们两国间相互关系，也有利于欧洲的稳定。”
