Polish President Nominates New Prime Minister Candidate
Polish United Workers' Party to Participate in New Government

WARSAW, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Jaruzelski today accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Kiszczak, who had been in office for only half a month, and nominated Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a chief advisor to Solidarity and editor-in-chief of the Solidarity newspaper "Solidarity Weekly," as the candidate for Polish prime minister.

Jaruzelski's spokesman said that there were "some differences of opinion" within the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, but it ultimately agreed to form a coalition government led by Solidarity because "there was no other choice."

After accepting the nomination, Mazowiecki told Polish television reporters that if the parliament appoints him as the new prime minister, the new government will "open up to all other political and social forces on the basis of joint governance by Solidarity, the United Peasants' Party, and the Democratic Party."

WARSAW, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- The 14th Plenary Session of the 10th Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party was held here today to discuss changes in the Polish government. The meeting decided to support the participation of the United Workers' Party in the new government led by a prime minister from Solidarity.

This plenary session was held amid significant changes in Poland's political landscape. During the cabinet formation process, Kiszczak, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government prime minister, faced opposition from the Solidarity-led opposition and rejection from the United Workers' Party's allies, the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, and was forced to resign as prime minister. Solidarity, the United Peasants' Party, and the Democratic Party then joined forces, holding a majority in the parliament, and Mazowiecki, a chief advisor to Solidarity, was nominated as the candidate for prime minister. Facing this severe situation, the United Workers' Party had to make a choice: whether to participate in the new government led by a prime minister from Solidarity or to become an opposition party.

At the plenary session, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Rakowski, said that the new political situation requires the United Workers' Party to become a "party that engages in political struggle," a party that "fights to defend the party's program and ideals" and "fights to defend the historic achievements of the People's Republic of Poland."

After a lengthy discussion, the plenary session adopted a document titled "The Position of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party." The document stated that only a government that enjoys broad social trust and support, and is "participated in by representatives of various political and social forces in Poland," can help Poland overcome its economic crisis. The document said that the Central Committee "supports the establishment of such a grand coalition government."

    波总统提名新总理候选人
    波兰统一工人党将参加新政府
    据新华社华沙8月19日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰总统雅鲁泽尔斯基今天接受了刚上任半个月的基什查克总理的辞呈，并提名团结工会主要顾问、团结工会机关报《团结周报》主编马佐维耶茨基为波兰政府总理候选人。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基的发言人说，波兰统一工人党中央委员会内部存在“某些意见分歧”，但最终同意成立以团结工会为领导的联合政府，因为除此之外，“别无其他选择”。
    马佐维耶茨基在接受提名后向波兰电视台记者发表谈话表示，一旦议会任命他为新政府总理，新政府将“在团结工会、统一农民党和民主党联合执政的基础上向所有其他政治、社会力量开放”。
    据新华社华沙8月19日电  波兰统一工人党10届14中全会今天在这里举行，讨论波兰政府变更问题。会议决定赞同统一工人党参加由团结工会代表担任总理的新政府。
    这次全会是在波兰政局发生重大变化的形势下召开的。波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、政府总理基什查克在组阁过程中，遭到以团结工会为核心的反对派的抵制以及统一工人党的盟党——统一农民党和民主党的拒绝，被迫辞去政府总理职务。而团结工会与统一农民党和民主党则联合起来，它们在议会中占多数，团结工会的主要顾问马佐维耶茨基已被提名为政府总理候选人。面临这一严峻形势，统一工人党必须作出抉择：是参加以团结工会代表为总理的新政府，还是从执政党变为在野的反对党。
    波兰统一工人党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基在全会上说，新的政治形势要求统一工人党成为“进行政治斗争的党”，“为捍卫党的纲领和理想”、“为保卫人民波兰的历史性成就而斗争的党”。
    经过长时间的讨论，全会还是通过了题为《波兰统一工人党中央委员会的立场》的文件。文件认为，只有享有社会广泛信任和支持的、“由波兰各政治、社会力量代表参加”的政府才能使波兰摆脱经济危机。文件说，中央委员会“赞成建立这样的大联合政府”。
