Title: Cherish Literature and Guide Literature

Since the beginning of the new era, literary creation has achieved great success, and in recent years, the achievements have been significant. There is an old Chinese saying, "Within five steps, there must be fragrant grass; in a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people." Our country is so large, and there are so many creators. This is something everyone can feel. Whether it is long, medium, or short works, the annual output is substantial, and the number of good and relatively good works is considerable. Readers have ample choices and can take what they need.

In recent years, I have not read many medium and short stories, but among the numerous works, some I have read have considerable skill and distinctive features, and I appreciate them very much. The lives depicted in these works give me the feeling of being as rich and colorful as life itself, showing the trend of historical progress. They do not avoid the twists and turns of history and the difficulties of life, but their purpose is to heal, aiming to convey the people's eager hope for reform. As for those works that sing praises of the Party, the people, the revolutionary war, and the reform wave, the spirit of the times and the inspirational power are even stronger. These works reflect their authors' fervent and profound feelings for the Party and the people's revolutionary cause.

Our creative achievements are naturally the result of the authors' hard work, but they are also the result of the Party, the people, and life nurturing literature. We cannot overlook these achievements. While fully affirming the achievements, we must not ignore the influence of bourgeois liberalization. During Comrade Zhao Ziyang's tenure as General Secretary, a policy of laissez-faire was adopted, leading to some chaos in the literary world. Creativity, freedom, and relaxation are all good, but this does not mean that we do not need to seriously and responsibly guide creativity, nor does it mean that the state of anarchy in the literary world is reasonable. Without guidance, laissez-faire, some people may go astray, and thus, their precious youth and talents will be wasted. One day, when they finally realize this, they will blame us. They will say: Why didn't you remind us in time? Why didn't you give us the mirror of history? Therefore, we must guide them, using Marxist dialectical materialism to guide, using positive spiritual civilization content to guide, using perfect artistic forms to guide, and using the inheritance and promotion of national excellent cultural traditions to guide. Many comrades pay attention to reflecting the profound changes in national life in the new era, pay attention to expressing national spirit, revolutionary spirit, and the spirit of the times, and pay attention to the diversity of artistic expression and national style, all of which is to provide a correct guidance.

In recent years, there have been many discussions about Western modernism, and in creation, there have been various correct and incorrect expressions. My view is that modernism should be absorbed, but it should be combined with national life, a kind of absorption that aims to enrich ourselves rather than cancel ourselves, an absorption with conditions and choices. In a word, using the West to serve China, not making ourselves neither horse nor mule, neither fish nor fowl. Eastern culture and Western culture are different, each with its own advantages, neither can replace the other, only bilateral exchanges are possible, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses.

Some excellent works, whether consciously or unconsciously, draw on the excellent national cultural traditions and are particularly noteworthy. These works are not simple replicas of traditional literary spirit and models. There is also sublation, and there is also beneficial absorption of Western modernism. Some symbolic images concretize and abstract national spirit, elevating it to a level that covers everything.

Another point I want to mention is that we need to reflect. In history, whenever there has been a major reflection, culture has flourished and developed. In 1952, we criticized the formulaic and conceptual works that were prevalent at the time, and guided the creation of a batch of works that touched on social life in the early 1950s. Around 1962, we also reflected on the works of the Great Leap Forward, producing a batch of relatively good works. In short, we cannot sever history. The theory of cultural "discontinuity" is harmful, believing that except for the works of recent years, there was no literature before, it was the Middle Ages, a desert. This is not conducive to the prosperity of literature and is not conducive to the unity of the literary team.

Currently, there is a sense that creation is somewhat aimless. This can be understood. However, we should believe that opposing bourgeois liberalization will not harm literary creation; it is for the healthy development of literature. Bourgeois liberalization should be opposed, literature should be protected and supported, and by unifying these two aspects, literature will have greater development. We must strive together to create truly high-level literature that is worthy of our times and people!

    爱护文学  引导文学
    李準
    新时期以来，文学创作取得了很大成绩，近几年来，成绩也是主要的。中国有句老话“五步之内，必有芳草，十室之邑，必有忠信”。我们国家这么大，创作人员这么多，这是大家都能感受到的。无论是长篇、中篇、短篇，都有很大的年产量，好的和比较好的作品数量也很可观。读者有充分的选择余地，各取所需。
    近年来的中短篇小说我看得不多，但在众多的作品中，有的我看过，它们有相当的造诣和特色，我也很欣赏。这些作品所描写出的生活，给我的感觉，是像生活本身一样的丰富和多姿多彩，显示出历史前进的趋势。它们没有回避历史的曲折和生活的艰难，但目的在于疗救，意在传达人民要求改革的热切希望。至于那些正面歌颂党、人民、革命战争、改革浪潮的作品，时代精神和鼓舞力量就更强烈了。这些作品表现了它们的作者对党和人民的革命事业，有一种激越和深沉的感情。
    我们创作的成绩，自然是作者们艰苦劳动的收获，但也是党、人民、生活哺育文学的结果。不能忽略这些成绩。在充分肯定成绩的同时，也不能无视资产阶级自由化的影响。赵紫阳同志做总书记阶段，采取放任自流的政策，造成了文坛的某种混乱。创作自由、宽松，话都不错，但这不意味着不需要对创作加以严肃的、负责的引导，不意味着文坛的无政府状态是合理的。不加引导，放任自流，某些人就有可能步入歧途，那样，大好的年华便浪费了，宝贵的才能便糟蹋了。将来有一天，他们终于醒悟了，便会埋怨我们。他们会说：当初你们为什么不及时提醒我们？为什么不把历史的镜子交给我们？因此一定要加以引导，用马克思主义的辩证唯物论来引导，用积极的精神文明思想内容来引导，用完美的艺术形式来引导，用继承发扬民族优秀文化传统来引导。许多同志重视反映民族生活在新时期所发生的深刻变革，重视表现民族精神、革命精神、时代精神，重视艺术表现的多样性和民族风格，就是希望作出一种正确的引导。
    这几年，关于西方现代派的议论很多，在创作上也有这样那样或正确或不正确的表现。我的看法是，现代派应该吸收，但应该和民族的生活相结合，是一种目的在于丰富我们自己而不是取消我们自己的吸收，是有条件有选择的吸收。一句话，洋为中用，不是使我们自己变得非驴非马，不伦不类，东方文化和西方文化是不一样的，各有自己的优势，谁也不能取代谁，只可作双向的交流，互相取长补短。
    有些好作品因为自觉或不自觉地借鉴民族优秀文化传统而格外引人注意。这些作品也不是传统文学精神和传统文学模式的简单的翻版，这里面也有扬弃，还有对西方现代派的有益的吸收，有些象征意象，它把民族精神具象化也抽象化了，把它升华到一种覆盖万物的地步。
    再一点我想要说的就是我们需要进行一点反思。历史上凡是有大的“反思”都使文化得到繁荣和发展。1952年我们对当时充斥于创作上公式化和概念化的作品，进行了批评和引导，使50年代初期出现了一批接触到社会生活的作品。1962年左右，我们又对大跃进时的作品进行了反思，也产生了一批较好的作品。总之，我们不能割断历史，那种文化“断层”论是有害的，认为除了近几年的作品，以前根本没有文学，是中世纪，是一片沙漠，这不利于文学的繁荣，也不利于文学队伍的团结。
    目前隐隐感到创作有一点无所适从的样子。可以理解。不过，应该相信，反对资产阶级自由化不会损害文学的创作，它是为文学的健康发展服务的。资产阶级自由化应该反对，文学应该保护和扶持，把这两者统一起来，文学会有更大的发展。我们要为创造无愧于我们的时代和人民的真正高水平的文学而团结奋斗！
