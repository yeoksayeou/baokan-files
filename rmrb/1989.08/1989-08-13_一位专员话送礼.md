Recently, I encountered a bureau chief in a certain place in Henan. When talking about using public funds for gift-giving, he had a lot to say. Here is the record:

To be honest, there are some things I don't like. But everyone is doing it, so if you don't do it, you're out of the game? Anyway, I have my own rule: I never use public funds or items to give gifts. I have some old superiors in Beijing and a few classmates who have become high-ranking officials. When I go to Beijing, I often visit them. I bring them some dried dates and green beans from here. They like it, and I can afford it myself.

When subordinates go to the province or to Beijing with gifts, I just turn a blind eye. The competition is so fierce; if you don't bring gifts to lobby, you won't get the projects that should be allocated to you, or the materials and funds you should receive. How can my local economy develop?

There are good people up there too. I know a responsible person in the State Planning Commission who doesn't accept gifts. If someone tries to give him something, he scolds them, and no one dares to give him gifts. When he comes down on a business trip to inspect, if he sees that you really need a project, he approves it without gifts or entertainment. It's a pity there are so few officials like him. Some people in charge of projects, money, and materials, if you go to their home, as soon as they open the door and see you don't have anything, "Not at home!" "Bang," they close the door. To be honest, many problems at the lower levels are forced by the higher levels!

I just don't understand why those departments that control project funds can't, at the beginning of the year, after setting aside a necessary reserve, publicly allocate all the projects? Why force the lower levels to bring gifts and run around for projects? In my opinion, this is just a way to force people to give gifts and bribes to fill their own pockets! Do you think my view is reasonable?

If corruption is not curbed, the party will degenerate! Corruption is prevalent at all levels, and it must be addressed. But don't forget to "lead the cow by the nose"! First, clean up the central and provincial leadership organs, and then you won't have to worry about leading the "cow" back on the right path.

    一位专员话送礼
    笔者最近在河南某地遇一行署专员，谈起公款送礼，他颇多感慨。实录如下：
    说实在的，现在有些事我也看不惯。可都这么干，你不干中不中？反正我自己有一条：我绝不用公家的钱物去送礼。我在北京有些老上级，也有几位做了大官的老同学。我去北京的时候常去看看他们。给他们带点这里出的枣干儿、绿豆什么的。他们喜欢，我自己掏腰包也承受得起。
    下面的人进省进京带东西，我就睁一只眼闭一只眼了。竞争这么厉害，你不带东西去活动，该分到的项目分不到，该拿到的物资款项拿不到，我这里的经济还怎么发展？
    上头也有好的。我认识国家计委的一位负责人，就没人敢往他家送东西。他一见给他送东西就骂人，谁也不敢去送。他出差下来考察，见到你确实需要的项目，不送礼不招待他也拍板。可惜这样的干部少了。有些手里管项目管钱管物的，你到他家去，出来开门的往你手上用眼这么一扫，见没东西，“不在家！”“呯”地把门就关上了。说实在的，下头的许多毛病是上头逼出来的！
    我就不明白，那些手里攒着项目款项的部门，为什么就不能在年初除了留点必要的机动部分外，把全部项目公开分下来？非逼着下头带上东西，一趟又一趟地“跑项目”不可？我看说穿了，这是变着法儿地逼着人家送礼行贿以中饱自己的私囊！你说我这看法有没道理？
    腐败不治，党要变质！腐败之风上下都有，都要治，但别忘了“牵牛要牵牛鼻子”！首先把中央和省级领导机关整治好了，就不愁把“牛”牵到正路上来。
