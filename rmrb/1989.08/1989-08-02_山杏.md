On a bright and sunny day, I received a package from my mother. I carefully unwrapped the green silk cloth to reveal a tightly sealed wooden box. I couldn't imagine what my mother had put inside, so I cautiously opened it. Ah, it was filled with delicate mountain apricots.

Mother! I couldn't help but feel a surge of love from my mother. In an instant, a scene appeared in my mind: under the apricot tree, my mother held a bamboo pole, her face calm and serene, as she counted the ripe apricots.

I remember that when I was young, we didn't have any apricot trees in our home. During the apricot season, my twin brother Xiaogang and I would always stare enviously at the apricot tree in the neighbor's yard. One day, we couldn't resist the temptation and, when no one was around, we used a slingshot to knock down about a dozen apricots. This time, we were in big trouble. The neighbor's wife saw the fallen apricots and scolded us for hours. My kind and gentle mother, upon learning that we were the culprits, carried a basket of millet and insisted on taking us to the neighbor's house to apologize. Later, Mother decided to plant a row of apricot trees. Year after year passed, the apricot trees grew taller, and the apricot blossoms bloomed and fell, but none of them bore fruit. Mother secretly asked around, and someone said that male apricot trees only bloom and do not bear fruit. Mother didn't believe that all the trees she planted were male apricots, and neither did we. Finally, one spring, the small apricot trees bore fruit after the blossoms fell, though it was only a few scattered ones. We couldn't help but cheer and jump for joy.

Time flew by, and the once small apricot trees were now lush with leaves. The years passed like a river, and before we knew it, my brother and I had grown up and left Mother, leaving the apricot trees behind.

Xiaogang and I both took the college entrance exam. Xiaogang scored excellently and was admitted to the Chinese Literature Department, while I, due to my infatuation with the muses, neglected my studies and failed. In the past, I rarely thought about the college entrance exam, perhaps because I was used to being carefree and impulsive. But when the results were in, my pain was unprecedented. Xiaogang and I are twin brothers, and we had rarely been apart, our thoughts and intelligence always in sync. But during the summer exams, we ended up with such different outcomes. Reflecting on the past, my romantic days had caused me to lose too much of my studies. Even if I retested for a year, I wouldn't be able to get into my ideal school. At this moment, Xiaogang made a shocking decision: he suggested that I go in his place, and he would stay behind to retest. He said, "It won't be discovered. We are twin brothers, looking exactly alike. Besides, you would fit right in at the Chinese Literature Department, and your studies and major wouldn't be a problem." To be honest, I was tempted! The shores of the Unnamed Lake are the holy grounds of my dreams! But Mother strongly opposed it. She said, "Even if Dajian stays home to farm, I wouldn't let you do this. One must be upright. Others might not be able to tell us apart, but a mother can."

Later, Xiaogang went to Beijing to study, and I gave up many of my dreams. Carrying a few simple volumes of poetry, I resolutely joined the military, leaving Mother in our hometown's courtyard, guarding the mountain apricots...

This full box of apricots holds so much of Mother's deep affection, love, and longing! Ah, did Xiaogang also receive a box of apricots? Is he also deeply missing Mother? So, I quickly wrote a letter to Xiaogang, excitedly saying, "Xiaogang, I received the apricots Mother sent. Did you?"

While waiting for Xiaogang's reply, my comrades and I were ordered to go to Beijing. The turmoil and unrest made the capital chaotic, and we were there to maintain order. I really didn't know what this mission would bring us. Would my younger brother be among those university students?

Like experiencing a storm, my comrades and I emerged from the bloody chaos. Every moment, I was thinking about Xiaogang. How was he doing now?

Unexpectedly, Xiaogang came to find me at the base. I originally planned to ask him if he had participated in the turmoil, but instead, I blurted out, "Did you receive Mother's apricots?"

"Yes, I did," Xiaogang replied, biting his lip and sighing, "At the same time, I received a letter from my classmate Xiaoguang. He said that our apricot tree, which was full of green apricots, was struck down by spring thunder."

"What?"

"The apricot tree has fallen!" Xiaogang repeated several times, "The apricot tree has fallen..."

It was hard to believe! Our only fruiting apricot tree had fallen. Ah, my lonely Mother must be so heartbroken! But I thought, no, it couldn't be! The apricots Mother sent me, I had already eaten with my comrades. The refreshing sweetness remains on my lips and in my heart. My diligent Mother, where did you get these apricots from?

I held Xiaogang's hand and said, "The apricot tree has fallen, but our Mother will plant more apricot trees in the courtyard, and they will definitely bear fruit, more and sweeter fruit..."

    一个明媚的日子，收到母亲寄来的包裹，揭开翠绿色的绸布，里面是一个封得严严实实的木匣子。我无法想象母亲会在里面装些什么，小心翼翼地打开，呵，一颗颗玲珑的山杏子。
    哎，母亲！我不禁强烈地感受到母亲的爱心，我的脑中霎时映出一幅图景：杏树下，母亲执着竹竿，仰着娴静的脸，在细数着熟透了的杏子。
    记得我小时候，家中并没有杏树的，杏黄时节，我和孪生弟弟小刚总是眼馋地盯着邻居家的杏树。有一天，实在耐不住了，趁无人时，用弹弓打了十几个。这下可闯祸了，邻居家的女人看到地上的落叶，叫街似地骂了几个时辰。善良温厚的母亲得知是我们干的后，端上一升小米，硬是拉着我们哥俩到邻居家赔罪。后来，母亲就发狠地栽下了一排杏树。一年年过去了，杏树大了，杏花纷开纷落，可竟没有一棵挂果。母亲私下向人打听，有人说，公杏是只开花不挂果的。母亲不相信她栽下的全是公杏，我们哥俩也不相信。终于在一个春天，瘦小的杏树花落结果了，虽然是零星点缀，我们不禁欢呼雀跃。
    光阴荏苒，当初瘦小的杏树已枝叶繁茂。岁月如梭，转眼我们哥俩也长大了，并相继离开了母亲，离开了杏树。
    我和小刚一起参加了高考。小刚以优异的成绩考取了中文系，而我呢？由于迷恋缪斯的芳醇，荒芜了学业，名落孙山。在以往的日子里，我很少思考高考的问题，也许是洒脱任性惯了。可当事实面临，我的痛苦是前所未有的。我和小刚是孪生兄弟，从小就很少分离过，思想才智是心有灵犀一点通的，可伏天高考，竟使我们有了天壤之别。痛定思痛，过去的浪漫日子，使我丢失了过多的学业，即使再复读一年，也考不取理想的学校。这个时候，小刚竟做出一件惊人的打算，让我去替他，他留下来复读，他对我说：“这不会露馅的，我们是孪生兄弟，模样一模一样，再说，你到中文系也如鱼得水，学业专业都不会差。”说真的，我真动心了！未名湖畔是我梦里千百度的圣园啊！可是，母亲强烈反对，她说：“即使大刚在家种地，我也不让你们这样做，做人要正，你们模样别人分不清，做妈的分得清。”
    后来，小刚上北京读书，我丢掉许多梦想；带着几本简陋的诗稿，毅然投身军营，撇下母亲在家乡的小院，守着山杏子……
    这满满一盒杏子凝聚着母亲几多深情，几多爱心，几多等待啊！呵，小刚是否也收到了这样一盒杏子呢？他是否也在深深地眷念着母亲呢？于是，我急急地给小刚写了一封信，信中兴奋地说：小刚，我收到母亲寄来的杏子了，你收到了吗？
    在等待小刚回音的日子里，我和我的战友奉命进京了。学潮和动乱使京都乱糟糟的，我们为维护秩序而来。我真不知道此行将给我们带来什么，那些大学生里有我的弟弟吗？
    像经历一场暴风雨一样，我和我的战友们从血腥火海中闯过来了，我每时每刻都在想着小刚，他现在怎么样了呢？
    没想到，小刚竟上驻地找我来了。我原本第一句话是要问他是否参加学潮的，不料却问出了这样一句话：“你收到了母亲的杏子吗？”
      “收到了。”小刚咬着嘴唇，又叹口气，说，“同时我还收到同学小光的来信，他说，我家挂满青杏的杏树被春雷劈倒了。”
      “什么？”
    “杏树倒了！”小刚重复了几遍：“杏树倒了……”
    真难以相信！我家唯一挂果的杏树倒下了。呵，我那孤寂的母亲会多难过呵！但我又想，不，不会的！母亲邮给我的杏子我早已和战友们吃光了，那沁人心脾的甘醇永远留在我的唇边，荡涤在我的心头。我苦心的母亲，您是从哪里弄来的杏子呢？
    我拉住小刚的手，说：“杏树倒了，可我们的母亲会在小院里栽下更多的杏树，一定会挂果，挂更多更甜美的果……
