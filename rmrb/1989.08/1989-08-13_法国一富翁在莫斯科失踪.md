According to the Soviet newspaper *Trud*, French millionaire Jean Basmadjian was invited to visit the Soviet Union by the Soviet Ministry of Culture and the International Book Publishers on July 21. He disappeared after leaving the "Russia Hotel" in Moscow on July 29.

The reporter from *Trud* learned from the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs that Basmadjian is a famous art collector in France. After the Armenian earthquake, he donated five valuable paintings to the Armenian victims. One of the purposes of his visit to the Soviet Union this time was to handle the legal procedures for these five donated items.

The search for him is ongoing. In addition to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Soviet State Security Committee is also participating in this work. It is reported that some clues have been found that can be used for the case.

    法国一富翁在莫斯科失踪
    新华社莫斯科8月12日电　法国一个百万富翁半月前在莫斯科神秘失踪，至今下落不明。
    据苏联《劳动报》报道，今年7月21日，法国百万富翁巴斯马德让应苏联文化部和国际书籍出版社的邀请来苏联访问。7月29日离开莫斯科“俄罗斯饭店”后一直未归。
    该报记者从苏联内务部了解到，巴斯马德让是法国著名的名画收藏家。亚美尼亚地震后，他主动向亚美尼亚灾民捐献5幅珍品。此次来苏的目的之一就是为这5幅赠品办理法律手续的。
    目前寻人工作正在进行。除内务部外，苏国家安全委员会也参加了这项工作。据称，已发现一些线索可供破案参考。
