The small bridges along the shores of Lake Weishan are as numerous as the stars in the night sky, embedded in the jade-like expanse of the great lake. Each star shines brightly, each one is lovable, but among them, one star shines with an exceptionally brilliant light, making me deeply attached to it.

Not long ago, one evening as I drove south, the wind and rain suddenly roared fiercely.

My heart felt like it was hanging over a precipice, and before my eyes appeared a scene that made my heart tremble: last year, a colleague, Xiao Liu, met with an accident on that very bridge...

Tonight, encountering another storm, that shadow grew even darker.

The bridge indeed appeared, the stone slabs were crooked and uneven, loosely scattered. My heart leaped to my throat, I steadied myself, ready to speed up, but suddenly a figure flashed by at the bridgehead. I hurriedly slammed on the brakes and anxiously got out of the driver's seat. An emaciated old man, staggering to his feet, hurried to pick up the hammer and chisel that had fallen out. The old man was clearly a stone mason, his back hunched like a bow about to break under the weight of a heavy mountain. He was soaked from head to toe, his aged face calm. I wanted to express my apologies, but the old man smiled warmly and patted my shoulder, "Young man, drive on with courage." His voice was hoarse, and before the words fell, his figure had already disappeared into the distance.

The car drove onto the small bridge, the wheels rolled over the newly laid straw mats, soft and steady, much smoother.

After crossing the bridge, my heart finally settled. I thought of the old man, sometimes admiring him, sometimes chuckling to myself: this old fellow is really something, what is he doing this for? Nowadays, everyone is digging holes and making money, but he risks his life to protect this small bridge?

On the way back, I passed by the small bridge again. The rain was still falling steadily, and many people were gathered at the bridgehead, bustling about.

Curiosity drove me to get out of the car and walk over to the bridge. Seeing the scene, my eyes widened in shock: at the gentle slope by the bridgehead, an old man lay quietly, his wrinkled face like a blooming yellow chrysanthemum, radiating confidence and satisfaction.

Behind me, someone sobbed, "He did it all for this bridge, like it was his own son..."

A young stone mason also cried out, "He was the leader of our stone team, he didn't chase after big money, he worked on this bridge every day... wuwu..."

The lakeside was filled with a hushed silence, a heavy silence.

I took the opportunity to examine the bridge pier. Where the floodwaters had eroded, there were a few patches of blood-stained yellow soil and several newly laid blue stones. The old man must have been struck by the stone... I suddenly realized that the silent sleeper was none other than the old man I had encountered last night!

Suddenly, the old man who had not left his name behind stood before me again, warmly patting my shoulder. Later, when I passed by Lake Weishan again, I crossed that small bridge. It had become a brand new stone bridge. Upon inquiring, I found out that after the old man passed away, groups of stone masons came to repair the bridge, and more and more people joined in...

Looking at the newly built bridge, looking at the freshly dug grave, I placed a carefully picked bouquet of wild chrysanthemums, silently, silently...

Oh, the small bridge by Lake Weishan, what a bright star it is.

    湖畔，有一座小桥
    高岳
    微山湖畔的小桥，如夜空的星星一般多，镶嵌在玉盘似的大湖边。星儿亮晶晶，颗颗都可爱，其中有一颗闪着格外耀眼的光芒，令我深深地眷恋。
    不久前的一天，我驱车去南方，时近傍晚，突然，风和雨肆虐地吼了起来。
    我的心像悬在崖上，眼前浮现了令人心悸的一幕：去年，同车队的小刘，就是在那座小桥上遇了难……
    今夜，又遇暴风雨，那片阴影愈发浓重了。
    小桥果然出现了，石板歪七扭八，松松散散。我的心一下子蹦到了嗓子眼儿，定了定神，正要加速，桥头上猛地闪过一个人影。我慌忙刹了车，惶惶走下驾驶室。一个干瘦的老人，蹒跚着站起，忙去捡拾摔出的铁锤和凿子。老人俨然一位老石匠，脊梁弯弯，像欲折的弓驮着沉重的山似的。他浑身上下湿漉漉的，苍老的脸极平和。我欲表示歉意，老人却温和地笑着，拍拍我的肩：“小伙子，大胆开吧。”声气哑哑的，话音没落，那影儿便飘远了。
    汽车上了小桥，车轮碾在新铺的草苫上，软软的，稳稳的，平实多了。
    小桥过了，吊着的心儿落了下来。念叨起那老人，时儿赞叹，时儿暗暗发笑：这老头真是的，咋那般好事，图个啥？眼下，人家都钻窟窿打洞儿搞钱，他倒豁了性命护这小桥？
    返回的路上，又经那座小桥，雨儿淅沥沥落个不停，桥堍旁聚了许多的人，乱哄哄正忙着什么。
    好奇心驱使我走下桥去，见状，眼睛骇得大大的：桥堍下的平缓处，静躺了一位老人，那多皱的脸如盛开的淡黄色菊花，漾着自信和满足的神色。
    身后，有人抽抽噎噎：“他都是为这个儿子一般的桥……”
    一个小石匠也哭诉道：“他本是俺石塘里领头的，放着大钱不挣，天天……呜呜。”
    湖畔，一片默哀，一片沉重。
    我趁机打量那桥垛，洪水啃咬处，有几片血染的黄土和几块新打的青石。老人怕是被那石头……我恍然明白，这无声无息的长眠者，不就是昨夜遇到的那老人吗！
    霍然，那个没留下名姓的老人，又站在了我的面前，温兮兮轻抚着我的肩。后来，又经微山湖，又过那小桥，它变成了一座崭新的石桥。一打听，原来老人去后，便有三三两两的石匠来修桥，而且越来越多了……
    望着那新新的桥，望着那添了新土的坟，我把精心采撷的一束野菊花，默默地放下，放下……
    哦，微山湖畔的小桥，好亮的一颗星哟。
