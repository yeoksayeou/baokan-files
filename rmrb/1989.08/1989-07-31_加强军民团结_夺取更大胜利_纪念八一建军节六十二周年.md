The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army has traversed a 62-year extraordinary journey of struggle. In the decisive victory of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, and the successful conclusion of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, with the spirit of the plenum being smoothly implemented, we welcome the August 1st Army Day.

The suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing was a sharp and complex struggle. In this struggle, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army were tested, and with their blood and lives, they defended the Party Central Committee, defended the people's democratic dictatorship, and defended the safety of the broad masses of the people, adding a new chapter to the glorious history of our army. The Party and the people will forever remember the merits of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and will forever remember the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their young lives for this cause. On this festive occasion, we pay our highest respects and extend our warm greetings to the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police who executed the martial law mission in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, to all military personnel, armed police, and the broad masses of militia.

Over the past 60-plus years, our country has undergone tremendous changes, overthrowing the three major mountains that weighed heavily upon us, and ending more than 100 years of being invaded and bullied. A socialist China stands tall in the East. These historical changes are the victories led by our Party, the victories of the people's struggle, and are also closely linked to the birth, growth, and heroic struggles of the people's army. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything."

The great victory of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion once again convincingly proves the significant role of the people's army in the peaceful construction period. The facts that have been exposed show that the domestic and international political climate has never been stable. Some hostile forces abroad have always tried to interfere in China, aiming to overthrow our people's government, overthrow the socialist system, and make China their vassal. Domestically, although the exploiting class as a class has been eliminated, class struggle will still exist for a long time within a certain scope and sometimes manifest quite intensely. This disturbance and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing have forcefully illustrated this point. A small number of people started from creating disturbances and gradually evolved into a horrifying counter-revolutionary rebellion, attempting to overthrow the people's government. The People's Liberation Army martial law troops, loyal to the Party, the country, and the people, rose up to defend the fundamental interests of the state and the nation, executed orders to counterattack, and swiftly suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, faithfully fulfilling the glorious duty bestowed upon the People's Liberation Army by the Constitution. The facts have proven that whether it is to consolidate national defense, resist aggression, and defend the motherland, or to implement people's democratic dictatorship and defend the people's peaceful labor, we must have a strong armed force as a strong pillar. With such an armed force, we can withstand any storms from within and without and be invincible.

The people's army loves the people, and the people love the soldiers, which is one of our fine traditions. The reason why our army has grown from small to large and from weak to strong, achieving one victory after another, is that it has always been the people's army and has gained broad support from the people. In the heroic struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the unity between the military and the civilians was fully demonstrated. Facing the ferocious rioters, to avoid injuring the onlookers, our soldiers repeatedly restrained themselves. Some soldiers, to avoid greater bloodshed, were severely injured or even sacrificed their lives. They proved with their actions that the People's Liberation Army is a genuine army of justice and civilization. In times of danger, the people also showed high political awareness. Some people bravely stood up to protect the soldiers' safety; some people fearlessly rescued the soldiers; and more people did their best to create various conditions for the People's Liberation Army to successfully complete the martial law mission. Although some civilians who were not fully aware of the situation had some misunderstandings about the army at the time, the exemplary actions of the soldiers quickly dispelled these misunderstandings, increased understanding, and genuinely supported and endorsed the people's children. In such a complex situation, the relationship between the military and the civilians underwent a severe test. This test will definitely elevate the unity between the military and the civilians to a new height. Through this struggle to suppress the rebellion, we can conduct a vivid education on supporting the military and loving the people, making everyone understand that the people cannot do without the army, and the army cannot do without the people; the people can only rely on their own army to have the most solid guarantee for their peaceful life and labor; the army can only rely on the people's support to overcome difficulties and successfully complete its mission. Of course, in the new historical period of reform and opening up, the environment and conditions are very different from the war years and also have many changes compared to the pre-reform and opening-up era. We need to study new situations, solve new problems, summarize new experiences, and make the relationship between the military and the civilians more harmonious. This work needs to be done by both the local authorities and the military, and everyone should participate. We believe that the deep affection between the military and the civilians will be consolidated and developed in the new era.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his speech to the military leaders of the Beijing martial law troops, highly praised the People's Liberation Army, pointing out that this shows that the children of the people are truly the iron wall of the Party and the state; it shows that our army is always under the leadership of the Party, always the defender of the state, always the defender of socialism, always the defender of the people's interests, and is the most beloved people. The reason why the People's Liberation Army is a reliable army for the Party, the state, and the people is that in the new era, they pay attention to combining with reality, inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions created and formed by the older generation of revolutionaries over more than half a century. We should learn from the People's Liberation Army, and in any situation, firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, maintain the correct political direction; resolutely implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and politically align with the Party Central Committee; adhere to the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, stand firmly with the people; never relax political and ideological work, use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres and the masses; with patriotism and revolutionary heroism as the spiritual force, strive hard, overcome difficulties, and forge ahead. The excellent traditions of the People's Liberation Army are not only the precious wealth of the army but also the common wealth of all the people. We should inherit and carry forward this precious wealth and make it play a greater role in the construction of the two civilizations. Of course, the army should also learn from the local comrades and the people, through effective measures such as joint military-civilian construction, encourage each other, and advance together.

Currently, the various tasks before us are very arduous. All military personnel and people of all ethnic groups across the country should maintain high morale, remain humble and steadfast, unite more closely under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, and grasp the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee to achieve new victories in the reform and opening up and the construction of socialist modernization.

    加强军民团结  夺取更大胜利
    ——纪念八一建军节六十二周年
    英雄的中国人民解放军走过了62年不平凡的战斗历程。在平息北京发生的反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利，党的十三届四中全会取得圆满的成果，全会精神正在顺利贯彻之际，我们迎来了八一建军节。
    平息北京发生的反革命暴乱是一场尖锐复杂的斗争。在这场斗争中，人民解放军指战员经受了考验，以自己的鲜血和生命，保卫党中央，保卫人民民主专政的政权，保卫广大人民群众的安全，为我军光辉的史册又增添了新的一页。党和人民将永远铭记解放军在平息反革命暴乱中建立的功勋，永远铭记为此而献出年轻生命的革命烈士。值此节日之际，我们谨向在平息反革命暴乱中执行戒严任务的人民解放军指战员、武警指战员和公安干警，向全军官兵、武警官兵和广大民兵，致以崇高的敬意和亲切的问候。
    60多年来，我们的国家发生了翻天覆地的变化，推翻了压在头上的三座大山，结束了100多年来被侵略、被欺侮的历史，一个沿着社会主义道路前进的中华人民共和国，巍然屹立于世界的东方。这些历史巨变，是我们党领导的胜利，是人民斗争的胜利，也是同人民军队的诞生、成长和英勇战斗紧紧联系在一起的。正如毛泽东同志所说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    平息反革命暴乱取得伟大胜利的事实，再一次雄辩地证明人民军队在和平建设时期的重大作用。已经揭露的大量事实说明，国内外的政治气候从来就不平静。国外某些敌对势力，总是企图插手中国，以颠覆我们的人民政权，推翻社会主义制度，使中国成为他们的附庸。在国内，剥削阶级作为阶级已经消灭，但阶级斗争还将在一定范围内长期存在，有时甚至表现得相当激烈。这次北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱，有力地说明了这一点。极少数人从制造动乱开始，逐渐演变成一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱，妄图推翻人民政权。忠于党、忠于祖国、忠于人民的人民解放军戒严部队，为了维护国家和民族的根本利益，执行命令奋起反击，一举平息了反革命暴乱，忠诚地履行了《宪法》赋予人民解放军的光荣职责。事实证明，巩固国防、抵抗侵略、保卫祖国也好，实行人民民主专政、保卫人民的和平劳动也好，我们都必须有一支强大的武装力量作为坚强柱石。有了这样一支武装力量，我们就能经得起国内外任何风浪的考验，无往而不胜。
    人民军队爱人民，人民热爱子弟兵，这是我们的一个好传统。我们军队之所以由小到大，由弱到强，取得一个又一个胜利，是因为它始终是人民的军队，得到人民的广泛支持。在平息反革命暴乱的英勇斗争中，也充分体现了军民团结的鱼水之情。面对凶残的暴徒，为了不误伤围观的群众，我们的战士一再克制忍让，有些战士为了避免发生更大的流血，被打成重伤甚至献出了自己的生命。他们以自己的行动证明了，解放军是一支名副其实的仁义之师、文明之师。在危难关头，人民群众也表现出很高的政治觉悟。有的人挺身而出，保护战士的安全；有的人临危不惧，救治解放军官兵；更多的人则是想方设法为解放军顺利完成戒严任务创造各种条件。尽管一些不明真相的群众一时对解放军有这样或那样的误解，但是解放军战士的模范行动，很快使人民消除了误解，增进了理解，从而真心实意地拥护和支持人民子弟兵。在这种极其复杂的情况下，军民关系经受了一次严峻考验。这场考验一定会使军民团结升华到一个新的高度。我们可以通过平息暴乱这场斗争，进行一次生动的拥军爱民的教育，使大家懂得人民离不开军队、军队也离不开人民的道理，懂得人民只有依靠自己的军队，和平生活和劳动才能有最坚实的保证；军队只有得到人民的支持，才能克服困难，顺利完成自己的使命。当然，在实行改革、开放的新的历史时期，环境、条件与战争年代有很大不同，与改革、开放以前也有不少变化，要研究新情况，解决新问题，总结新经验，使军民关系更加融洽。这个工作，地方要做，军队也要做，大家都来做。我们相信，军民鱼水相依的深厚感情一定能在新时期得到巩固和发展。
    邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部的讲话中对人民解放军予以高度评价，他指出，这表明，人民子弟兵真正是党和国家的钢铁长城；表明我们这个军队永远是党领导下的军队，永远是国家的捍卫者，永远是社会主义的捍卫者，永远是人民利益的捍卫者，是最可爱的人。人民解放军之所以是党、国家和人民可以信赖的军队，是因为在新时期，他们注意结合实际，继承和发扬半个多世纪以来老一辈革命家创造并形成的一整套优良的传统。我们要学习解放军，无论在任何情况下都旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，保持正确的政治方向；都坚决执行党的路线、方针、政策，和党中央在政治上保持一致；都坚持全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，紧紧地和人民站在一起；都不放松思想政治工作，用马列主义、毛泽东思想教育干部和群众；都以爱国主义和革命英雄主义为精神力量，艰苦奋斗，克服困难，一往无前。解放军的优良传统不仅是军队的宝贵财富，也是全体人民的共同财富。我们要把这份宝贵财富继承下来并发扬光大，使它在两个文明建设中发挥更大的作用。当然，军队也要向地方同志学习，向人民群众学习，通过军民共建等行之有效的措施，互相勉励，携手并进。
    当前，摆在我们面前的各项任务十分艰巨，全军官兵、全国各族人民要保持旺盛的斗志，不骄不躁，在党中央的领导下，更加紧密地团结起来，发扬艰苦创业的革命精神，切实抓好十三届四中全会提出的四件大事，夺取改革开放和社会主义现代化建设事业的新胜利。
