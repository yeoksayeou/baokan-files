American scientists say that the highest peak in North America, McKinley Mountain in the western part of the Alaska Range, is not as high as previously thought.

Scientists from the University of Alaska-Anchorage used highly sensitive gravimeters and satellites to remeasure McKinley Mountain and found that it is only 6189 meters high, which is more than 4 meters lower than the height calculated by Bradford Washburn in 1954. They said that the new measurements might have errors, but the maximum error would not exceed 0.3 meters.

Scientists explained that due to the large mass of McKinley Mountain, it has sufficient gravitational pull to cause the measurement technology used by Washburn to calculate the height of McKinley Mountain to be inaccurate.

    北美最高峰仅为6189米
    新华社华盛顿电　美国科学家说，位于阿拉斯加山脉西段的北美洲最高的麦金利山不像多年来人们所说的那么高。
    阿拉斯加—安克雷奇大学的科学家，通过极其灵敏的重差计和卫星对麦金利山进行了重新测量，发现麦金利山只有6189米，比布拉德福·沃什伯恩1954年计算出的高度低4米多。他们说，新的测量可能会有误差，但最多不超过0.3米。
    科学家们说，由于麦金利山的质量大，所以它有足够的引力，使沃什伯恩用于计算麦金利山高度的测量技术失准。
