As dawn breaks, the bustling water spout agricultural market in the eastern suburbs of Beijing comes to life. Amidst the crowded throng, an elderly man with graying hair is busy at work. He is Liu Qinghua, the director of the Shuizhui Tax Bureau in Chaoyang District and a labor model of Beijing.

At 59 years old, Liu Qinghua is a veteran of the first generation of tax officers in New China. He has dedicated 39 years to this line of work and has been recognized as an advanced worker multiple times. In early 1987, the Shuizhui Tax Bureau was established, and Liu Qinghua was appointed as its director.

The transactions at the Shuizhui agricultural market are typically large-scale. The sellers include local farmers from the suburbs of Beijing, as well as long-distance traders from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and even Xinjiang and Sichuan. Some operate independently, while others form partnerships. There are those who set up stalls as permanent vendors, but most are temporary traders who move from place to place. These individuals present a complex situation, and some are as slippery as eels, finding various ways to evade taxes. Liu Qinghua carries out his duties meticulously. Often before the vendors arrive, he is already there, waiting. With years of experience, he can estimate at a glance how much tax should be paid. No one can trick him or take advantage of the state.

Last spring, a vendor brought in a truckload of scallions, underreporting the quantity and delaying the tax payment. After being caught, he slipped away when the tax collector was not paying attention. Liu Qinghua remembered the incident. Two months later, when the vendor reappeared, thinking he had gotten away with it, Liu Qinghua immediately found him and made him pay the overdue tax, along with a fivefold penalty. The vendor, seeing that he couldn't get out of it, had no choice but to pay the tax and the 499 yuan in fines.

Under Liu Qinghua's leadership, the 12 staff members and 18 tax assistants of the Shuizhui Tax Bureau strictly enforce the law, plugging loopholes. Last year, they collected 1.5 million yuan in taxes, and this year, they have already collected 900,000 yuan in the first half of the year.

Liu Qinghua is unyielding when it comes to tax evasion and other illegal activities, but he also genuinely protects the interests of sellers, provides good service, and safeguards and attracts tax sources. He often tells his colleagues, "Not a single cent of what should be collected can be missed, and not a single cent of what should not be collected can be demanded." Recently, a vendor brought in a truckload of green beans from out of town early in the morning, priced at 0.80 yuan per kilogram, and paid 51 yuan in taxes as required. Later, because several baskets of green beans turned yellow, he had to lower the price. Liu Qinghua, upon hearing this, instructed the tax collector to calculate the tax based on the actual selling price and refund the overcollected tax. The vendor was very grateful.

Some state-owned and collective units in Beijing come to buy vegetables using bank drafts, and many out-of-town vendors are troubled by the inability to withdraw cash from these drafts. Some try to curry favor with the accountants of these units, offering bribes to get them to exchange the drafts for cash. Seeing this situation, Liu Qinghua applied to the bank for an account number and, after approval, handled the exchange of bank drafts for cash at the tax bureau. Over the past two years, they have processed more than 3,300 such transactions, greatly convenience out-of-town vendors, and maintained financial discipline.

"Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water" has become a creed for some people. However, this has nothing to do with Liu Qinghua, who has been a party member for 39 years.

Old Liu always thinks, "I am a tax officer of the Communist Party. I will not do anything that would make people talk behind my back!"

At the beginning of this year, an acquaintance introduced a vendor from Shandong who brought a truckload of garlic sprouts to the market. Beforehand, they sent a bag to his home, hoping he would "turn a blind eye" when collecting taxes. Liu Qinghua immediately returned the garlic sprouts and sternly criticized their actions, making them pay taxes honestly. He lives frugally and sets very high standards for his colleagues at the tax bureau. Once, a tax assistant took a bunch of grapes from a vendor and was severely reprimanded by Liu Qinghua. But when the tax assistant did not change his ways and took vegetables from the vendor again, Liu Qinghua, without a word, immediately dismissed him.

Sincerity, enthusiasm, and integrity—Liu Qinghua and his colleagues have won the trust of society through their actions.

    老税务刘庆华
    张淑媛　王锦鹄
    晨曦初上，北京东郊的水碓子农贸市场热闹起来了。在熙熙攘攘的人群中，一位头发斑白的老同志在忙碌。他就是朝阳区水碓税务所所长、北京市劳动模范刘庆华。
    59岁的刘庆华是新中国第一代税务干部。他在这条战线上已操劳39年，曾多次评为先进工作者。1987年初，水碓税务所建立，刘庆华出任所长。
    水碓子农贸市场的交易，一般都是大宗买卖。卖主中有本市郊县农民，也有来自河北、山东、河南甚至新疆、四川等地的长途贩运者；有跑单帮的，也有合股做买卖的；有设摊的“坐商”，更多的是“打一枪换一个地方”的临时客商。这些人情况很复杂，有些人滑得像泥鳅，变着法子偷税漏税。刘庆华执行公务一丝不苟，常常天不亮在商贩进场前，就在那守候了。凭着多年经验，一眼就能估出，该交多少税。谁也别想耍花招，占国家便宜。
    去年春上，有个商贩运来一车韭菜，少报份量，还拖着不上税，被查出后，又趁征管员不备溜走了。老刘记在心里。过了两月，这个商贩以为没事了，再次露面。老刘马上找他补税，并按章处以5倍罚金。这个商贩看到赖不掉，只得老老实实交了税款、罚金499元。
    在刘庆华带领下，水碓税务所12名干部、18名协税员严格执法，堵塞漏洞，去年一年征税150万元，今年上半年收税90万元。
    刘庆华对偷漏税等违法行为毫不心慈手软，但更实事求是地维护卖方利益，搞好服务，保护和吸引税源。他常对所里的同志说：“该收的一分不能少，不该收的一分不能要。”日前，有个商贩一大早从外地拉来一车豆角，开价0.80元1公斤，按章纳税51元。后因好几筐豆角发黄，只得降价出售。老刘知道后，关照征管员按实际售价计税，退还多收的税款，商贩十分感激。
    北京市一些国营、集体单位来买菜，用的是转帐支票，不少外地商贩收到转帐支票为提不到现金而犯愁。有的便设法巴结一些单位的会计，给好处费，求人家兑换现金。刘庆华见此情况，便向银行申请帐号，经批准在税务所代办转帐支票兑换现金业务，二年多来，已办3300多笔，大大方便了外地商贩，维护了财经纪律。
    “靠山吃山，靠水吃水”，当今已成为某些人的信条。然而这与有39年党龄的刘庆华毫不沾边。
    老刘总是想：“我是共产党的税务干部，决不干那种让人背后戳脊梁骨的事！”
    今年初，一位熟人介绍山东商贩运到市场一车蒜苗，事先给他家送去一袋，想让他收税时“高抬贵手”。老刘当即把蒜苗退回，还严厉批评了他们的做法，让他们据实纳税。他自奉甚俭，对税务所的同志要求也十分严格。有个协税员拿了商贩一串葡萄，被他狠狠地批评了一顿。但这个协税员没改，又白拿了商贩的蔬菜，老刘二话不说，马上将他辞退。
    真诚、热心、清廉，刘庆华与他的同事们，用自己的行动赢得社会的信任。
