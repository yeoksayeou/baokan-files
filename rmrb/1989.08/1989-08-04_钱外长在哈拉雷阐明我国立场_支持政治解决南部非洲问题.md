Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen announced tonight in Harare that China supports the efforts of the Frontline States of Southern Africa to politically resolve issues in the region.

Qian Qichen made these remarks at a welcome banquet hosted by Zimbabwe's Acting Foreign Minister Manhendi.

Qian Qichen said that China will continue to fulfill its responsibilities and promote the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, ensuring that Namibia achieves independence on schedule. China supports the South African people in their struggle against racism and for racial equality, and supports the reasonable demands and efforts of the Frontline States to politically resolve issues in Southern Africa.

He said that the Chinese government and people have been closely following the developments in Southern Africa with great concern. With the efforts of the Frontline States and other relevant parties, significant progress has been made in politically resolving issues in Southwest Africa. Currently, the Frontline States and other African countries are working hard to advance the process of Namibian independence and are actively seeking to resolve other issues through negotiations and dialogue. China highly appreciates the efforts of the Frontline States to further ease regional tensions.

Qian Qichen said that Southern Africa should be a region of peace and stability. Only with peace and stability can development and prosperity be achieved. The peace, stability, development, and prosperity of Southern Africa are not only important for the countries in Southern Africa but also for the entire African continent and even the world.

Qian Qichen said that to achieve these goals, the root cause of instability in the region—the apartheid system in South Africa—must be completely eliminated. He called on the South African authorities to follow the trend of history, change their stubborn attitudes, and abolish the apartheid system.

Zimbabwe's Acting Foreign Minister Manhendi pointed out that although there have been signs of easing tensions in Southern Africa, South Africa is attempting to disrupt the process of Namibian independence and obstruct the victory of the South West Africa People's Organization in the elections. Without the abolition of South Africa's apartheid system, there will be no true peace and stability in Southern Africa.

    钱外长在哈拉雷阐明我国立场
    支持政治解决南部非洲问题
    本报哈拉雷8月3日电  新华社记者张敬雷、本报记者李景卫报道：中国外长钱其琛今天晚上在这里宣布，中国支持南部非洲前线国家为政治解决本地区问题所作的一切努力。
    钱其琛外长是在津巴布韦代外长曼关迪为他举行的欢迎宴会上说这番话的。
    钱其琛说，中国将一如既往地履行自己的职责，推动联合国安理会435号决议的实施，使纳米比亚如期实现独立。中国支持南非人民反对种族主义、争取种族平等的斗争，支持前线国家为政治解决南部非洲问题的一切合理主张以及所作的一切努力。
    他说，中国政府和人民一直以关切的心情，密切注视着南部非洲形势的发展。在前线国家和其他有关方面的努力下，政治解决西南部非洲问题取得了重大突破。目前，前线国家和其他非洲国家正在全力推动纳米比亚的独立进程，并在积极谋求通过谈判和对话政治解决其他问题。中国高度赞赏前线国家进一步缓和地区紧张局势的努力。
    钱其琛说，南部非洲应当是和平的、稳定的。只有和平与稳定，才能实现发展与繁荣。南部非洲地区的和平、稳定、发展和繁荣，不仅对南部非洲各国，而且对整个非洲乃至世界的和平与发展都具有重要意义。
    钱其琛说，为了实现上述目标，必须彻底消除这一地区动荡的根源——南非的种族隔离制度。他呼吁南非当局顺应历史前进的潮流，改变顽固态度，废除种族隔离制度。
    津巴布韦代外长曼关迪指出，南部非洲虽然出现了缓和局势，但南非企图破坏纳米比亚独立进程，阻挠西南非洲人民组织在大选中获胜。南非种族隔离制度不废除，南部非洲就不会有真正的和平与稳定。
