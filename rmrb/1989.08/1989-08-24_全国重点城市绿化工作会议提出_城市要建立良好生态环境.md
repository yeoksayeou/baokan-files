A modern city should not only have tall buildings, convenient transportation, and a prosperous economy, but must also have a good ecological environment. Ignoring environmental greening means an incomplete city.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, 51 cities in China have entered the ranks of advanced cities in national greening. However, from an overall perspective, the ecological environment of cities is still deteriorating.

The conference proposed that to push the greening work of cities to a new stage, the following steps should be taken currently: carefully revise and improve greening plans to promote the standardization of urban greening work; establish and improve various regulations and systems to promote the institutionalization of greening management; pay attention to science and technology to promote the scientific greening of afforestation; strengthen propaganda and strictly enforce the law to promote the legalization of greening achievements protection work.

Participants in this conference included mayors and greening workers from 46 cities across the country.

    全国重点城市绿化工作会议提出
    城市要建立良好生态环境
    新华社长春八月二十三日电　（记者范向群）今天在长春结束的全国重点城市绿化工作会议提出，一个现代化城市，不应只是高楼林立、交通发达、经济繁荣，还必须具备良好的生态环境。忽视了环境绿化，就是一个不健全的城市。
    改革开放十年，我国已有五十一个城市进入全国绿化先进市行列。但是，从总体上讲，城市的生态环境仍呈恶化趋势。
    会议提出，为把城市绿化工作推向一个新的阶段，当前要认真修订、完善绿化规划，促进城市绿化工作规范化；建立健全各项规章制度，促进绿化管理制度化；切实注重科学技术，促进造林绿化科学化；加强宣传，严格执法，促进绿化成果保护工作法制化。
    参加这次会议的有来自全国四十六个城市的市长和绿化工作者。
