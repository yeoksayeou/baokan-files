In June, a fine drizzle fell, as if the sky itself was weeping...

The land of our motherland was almost engulfed by dark clouds and rumors.
On a speeding train, two mothers were weeping bitterly,
Like a duet of sorrowful lament...

The first mother's heart was torn apart, her tears flowing with grief.
She mourned for the loyal guardian, her voice filled with indignation.
She wept for her martyred son, her tears soaking her clothes,
Stirring the train's roar with a wrenching sympathy.

The second mother's heart was burning with anxiety, her tears bitter.
She was ashamed and could barely speak, her words choked with sorrow.
She regretted deeply for the son sitting beside her, her heart in turmoil!

Both mothers sighed:
They lamented the stark contrast in their sons' characters.
Why did they take such different paths?
Who shaped the guardians of the republic and the
Rioters who harmed the heroes?

On this speeding train,
One mother was heading to the capital to pay tribute to her son's loyal spirit;
The other mother, after much persuasion, accompanied her son to turn himself in.

The June sky,
Echoed with passionate weeping...

    母亲的泪……
    路比
    六月，细雨霏霏，天空似在哭泣……
    祖国的大地被乌云、谣言几乎湮没
    飞驰的列车上有两个母亲在呜咽哭泣
    似一曲伤痛的悲歌二重唱……
    第一个母亲心如刀割流着哀伤的泪
    她为忠诚卫士悲痛控诉
    她为罹难的儿子热泪溅湿了衣裳
    引起列车轰鸣嘶裂的同情
    第二个母亲，心急如焚眼泪苦涩，
    她羞愧难言，诉说却呜呜断肠
    她为坐在身边的儿子悔恨凄惶！
    带着极其沉重复杂的悲怆……
    两个母亲都在叹息：
    感叹她们儿子的性格迥异
    为什么会走如此不同的路？
    是谁塑造了共和国的卫士与
      残害英灵的暴徒
    在这飞驰的列车上，
    一个母亲要进京祭奠儿子的
      忠魂；
    另一个母亲却终于劝说并陪
      同儿子去自首，
    六月的天空，
    激动的哭泣……
