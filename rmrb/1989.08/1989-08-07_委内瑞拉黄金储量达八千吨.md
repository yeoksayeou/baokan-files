Venezuela has abundant gold resources. So far, the proven gold reserves amount to 8,000 tons, accounting for approximately 12% of the world's total gold reserves.

According to recent materials published by Venezuela's mining department, the country's gold mines are mainly located in the Guayana region, which borders Brazil. Of the 8,000 tons of gold reserves, 5,000 tons are suitable for open-pit mining.

Venezuela's current annual gold production is only about one ton. The country's mining department stated that to develop its gold resources on a large scale, it still lacks more than 400 technical personnel and a significant amount of capital.

    委内瑞拉黄金储量达八千吨
    新华社加拉加斯8月6日电　委内瑞拉黄金资源非常丰富，到目前为止，已探明的黄金蕴藏量达8000吨，约占世界黄金总储量的12％。
    据委矿业部门最近公布的材料表明，该国金矿主要分布在与巴西接壤的瓜亚那地区。8000吨黄金储量中，有5000吨适宜于露天开采。
    委内瑞拉目前的黄金年产量只有一吨左右。该国矿业部门说，若要大规模开发本国黄金资源，尚缺乏400多名技术人员和大量资金。
