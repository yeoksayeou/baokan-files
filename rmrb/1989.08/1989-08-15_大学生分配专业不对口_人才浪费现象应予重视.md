Title: The Problem of University Students Being Assigned to Inappropriate Majors Should Be Taken Seriously

From the Spring Festival until recently, our unit has received nearly 40 graduating university students who came to discuss job placements.

Among these students who came to discuss job placements, fewer than 20% were actually in fields that matched their majors in finance, finance and economics, or economic management. Many were from teacher training colleges, agricultural and forestry colleges, and engineering colleges.

One graduate student who studied systems engineering at a prestigious university even earnestly hoped to work at a bank. We could only advise these students to prioritize their careers and not easily give up the majors they had studied so hard for over the years. Some listened to our advice, but a portion of the students didn't care whether the job matched their major; they just wanted to go to units with good benefits and reputations.

I hope that the education department, when reforming the university student job placement system, will educate students to prioritize national interests and their careers. At the same time, a system should be established and improved to utilize their talents, to avoid wasting professional talents, and to avoid creating a new "useless education" phenomenon due to mismatched majors.

### 大学生分配专业不对口  人才浪费现象应予重视

    大学生分配专业不对口  人才浪费现象应予重视
    从春节到不久前，我单位接待了近40名今年即将毕业的大学生前来联系工作。
    在这些前来联系工作的大学生中，真正属于学用对口的金融专业或财政、经济管理专业的不到20％。许多是师范院校、农林院校、理工等专业的大学生或研究生。
    有一位在某名牌大学学系统工程的研究生，竟也言词恳切地希望来银行工作。我们只好劝说这些学生，应该以事业为重，不要轻易丢掉在校苦读几年的专业。有些人听从劝说，但有一部分同学却不管专业对口不对口，只要所去的单位福利待遇高、名气好就行。
    希望教育部门在改革大学生毕业分配制度时，要教育学生以国家利益为重，以事业为重；同时要建立和完善用其所长的制度，避免专业人才的浪费，避免因专业不对口造成新的“读书无用”现象。
