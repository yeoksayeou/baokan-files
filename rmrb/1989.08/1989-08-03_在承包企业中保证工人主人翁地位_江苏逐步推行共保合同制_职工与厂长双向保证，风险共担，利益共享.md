In contracted enterprises in Jiangsu, 25% have signed "joint guarantee contracts." In these enterprises, producers and managers share risks and benefits, and workers' mastery is genuinely ensured.

Various forms of contract responsibility systems have played a significant role in streamlining the relationship between the state and enterprises, enhancing enterprises' vitality. However, some enterprises have seen issues such as unfair distribution, short-term behavior, using contracts to replace management, and neglecting ideological and political work. These issues have affected workers' enthusiasm and creativity, with some workers even feeling like they are being employed.

Starting in 1987, cities like Lianyungang, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Nantong have successively tried various forms of joint guarantee contract systems. This involves the trade union, representing all workers, and the enterprise manager signing a "mutual guarantee" contract. The contract covers enterprise operational goals, technological upgrades, improvements in workers' labor conditions, welfare benefits, and enterprise cultural development. Practice has shown that this approach promotes the perfection of the contract responsibility system. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided to gradually implement this system in contracted enterprises over the next two to three years.

The joint guarantee contract, while affirming and maintaining the manager's authority, provides an effective path for workers' democratic management and supervision through contractual means. The contract, which includes enterprise development goals, management goals, joint guarantee measures, supervision, and reward and punishment regulations, must be discussed by workers and approved by the workers' congress. The contract clearly stipulates that the manager must regularly communicate with workers and accept consultations; the workers' congress and its working bodies must regularly check the enterprise's work and contract implementation. These regulations ensure that workers' participation in major enterprise decisions is genuinely guaranteed.

The signing of the joint guarantee contract links workers' personal interests with the enterprise's prosperity and decline, greatly promoting the spirit of mastery among workers. This year, in the face of severe challenges such as energy shortages, financial difficulties, and social unrest in some areas, enterprises that have implemented the joint guarantee contract have seen workers steadfastly defend their posts with a strong sense of responsibility. They have widely carried out activities such as "increasing production and saving resources," rationalization suggestions, technological innovations, and labor competitions. So far, 308 out of 319 enterprises that have early implemented the joint guarantee contract have passed the annual inspection and acceptance, completing all economic indicators set by the joint guarantee contract. Workers' living and welfare conditions have also improved accordingly.

    在承包企业中保证工人主人翁地位
    江苏逐步推行共保合同制
    职工与厂长双向保证，风险共担，利益共享
    新华社南京8月3日电  （记者李巍）江苏省实行承包经营的企业，已有25％签订了双向保证的“共保合同”。在这些企业里，生产者与经营者风险共担、利益共享，工人的主人翁地位落到了实处。
    各种形式的承包经营责任制，对理顺国家与企业的关系，增强企业的活力，发挥了重要作用。但一些企业出现的分配不公、短期行为、以包代管、忽视思想政治工作等现象，也影响了职工的积极性和创造性，部分职工甚至觉得自己成了被雇佣者。
    从1987年开始，连云港、扬州、南京、徐州、常州、苏州、南通等地，相继试行了多种形式的共保合同制。即由工会代表全体职工为一方，围绕企业经营目标、技术改造、职工劳动条件的改善、福利待遇的提高及企业文化建设等方面，同企业经营者签订“双向保证”的共保合同。实践证明，这一做法对完善承包经营责任制有推动作用。江苏省委、省政府已决定，今后两三年内，将在实行承包经营的企业中逐步推行。
    共保合同在肯定和维护厂长管理权威的同时，以契约形式为职工民主管理、民主监督提供了有效途径。合同中有关企业发展目标、管理目标、共保措施、监督和奖罚条例等，都要经过职工广泛讨论并经职代会通过。合同明确规定，厂长要定期与职工对话，接受咨询；职代会各工作机构要定期检查企业工作和合同执行情况。这些规定，使职工参与企业重大决策的权利得到了切实保证。
    共保合同的签订，将职工的切身利益同企业的兴衰紧密联系在一起，主人翁精神在职工中大大发扬。今年上半年，面临能源紧张、资金短缺、部分地方社会动乱的严峻形势，实行了双保合同的企业，职工们顶住重重干扰，以高度的主人翁责任感坚守岗位，广泛开展“双增双节”、合理化建议、技术革新、劳动竞赛等活动。到目前为止，319家较早实行共保合同的企业已陆续通过年度检查验收，其中308家完成了共保合同确定的各项经济指标，职工生活福利等也相应有所改善。
