Recently, the Central Documents Research Office edited and the People's Publishing House published "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," a scientific work that embodies seeking truth from facts and combining theory with practice, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. The "Selected Works" collects important speeches and documents by Comrade Xiaoping from 1938 to 1965. Many chapters have been studied before, and many speeches have been personally heard before. Now, studying them again, I feel a deep sense of familiarity. Especially, Comrade Xiaoping's report on "Overcoming Current Bad Tendencies in the West South Party" delivered at the 2nd Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China in Chongqing on June 6, 1950, deeply attracted me, making me feel more deeply that this brilliant work not only has an indelible historical significance but also has important guiding significance for strengthening the Party's ideological construction and maintaining and carrying forward the Party's fine style in the present and the future.

In November 1949, the 3rd Army Corps of the 2nd Field Army, following the orders of Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, closely cooperated with neighboring troops to annihilate more than 30,000 Nationalist troops north of Nanchuan, and then liberated the important city of Chongqing in the West South. At that time, I served as the commander of the 32nd Division of the 3rd Army Corps. The following early spring, after our 32nd Division completed the security mission in Chongqing, we were ordered to proceed to the Dazhu area to carry out the tasks of suppressing bandits, eliminating local tyrants, and establishing and consolidating rural political power. However, in the face of national victory, some comrades in our troops began to indulge in the pursuit of comfort and pleasure, unwilling to go to remote and hard areas to start work, thinking that "we have liberated Chongqing, so we should stay to enjoy urban life." Some comrades demanded better treatment in life, wanting to live in good houses, and even unwilling to live in houses without electricity. Some Party members and cadres were arrogant, detached from the masses, looked down on progressive non-Party personnel, and were seriously bureaucratic. Especially, some leading cadres could not withstand the test of victory and began to show signs of degeneration and corruption. These problems greatly damaged the Party's prestige, undermined the Party's cohesion, and seriously affected the Party's work focus shift, the completion of bandit suppression, and land reform tasks.

In response to various problems that arose in the Party's ideology after victory, Comrade Xiaoping, in accordance with Chairman Mao Zedong's spirit of conducting the third rectification movement, stood on the overall situation, summarized the experiences and lessons of the previous two rectification movements in the Party, fully explained the necessity and importance of this rectification movement, and clearly proposed: "We are facing a new area with 30 million people, and the cadres are relatively scattered, with many problems. These problems must be solved to move forward, so we must rectify." Regarding what to focus on during the rectification, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out bluntly, "One is the exclusivism in the united front, and the other is the developing tendency of degeneration and corruption." He believed that only by starting from the Party's cadres, especially the leading cadres, and resolutely overcoming special privileges, corruption, and bureaucracy, could the Party's cohesion and combat effectiveness be enhanced, the majority be united, and new work be opened up. He deeply expounded on the extreme importance of carrying forward the Party's fine style, emphasizing that whether the work in the West South is rooted correctly depends on whether the style of the Communist Party cadres is correct. "If the style is not correct, the root will be crooked, and it will be harmful for a long time." He seriously criticized the degeneration, corruption, and bureaucratic behavior of some Party cadres and further explained the necessity of adhering to the Party's united front, pointing out that "if the united front is abandoned, the revolution will suffer losses," and "if 80% of the people are not united well, can the work be done well? The danger of factionalism is obvious, isn't it?" Comrade Xiaoping also realistically analyzed the root causes of the emergence of degeneration and corruption, requiring that in the new situation, the Party must be strictly governed, and warned all Party members, especially leading cadres, to overcome the victory pass. In the tense bandit suppression struggle, our division party committee seriously conveyed and studied Comrade Deng's report, deeply feeling that Comrade Xiaoping combined Mao Zedong Thought with the actual situation in the West South, firmly grasped the key problems that arose in the Party after victory. His report is the inheritance and development of Comrade Mao Zedong's party-building thought. We unified our thoughts with Comrade Deng's report, carried out rectification while suppressing bandits, and first checked the main leading comrades of our division, educating all Party members to overcome all thoughts of enjoyment and corruption. The troops, through transmission and education, deeply criticized and self-criticized some comrades' corrupt thoughts and undisciplined phenomena. A comrade who had performed great deeds but sought enjoyment after victory deeply felt, "To be a Communist, one must think for the people for a lifetime and strive hard for a lifetime." The division party committee decided that Party members with serious degeneration and corruption, no matter how many merits they had in battle, would be strictly dealt with according to Party discipline. At that time, within the corps, a few senior cadres were expelled from the Party, put on probation, or removed from their posts, and some were given a major demerit. This rectification had a great impact on the troops, saving a large number of Party members and cadres. Many non-Party personnel saw that the Communist Party was truly serving the people and actively worked for the Party. Our 32nd Division, while carrying out strong military strikes on bandits, on the one hand, rectified and purified the thoughts and organizations of the Party members, on the other hand, went deep into the masses, mobilized the families of bandits, and united with progressive upper-class personnel. They successively forced four groups of bandits led by Cao Laoyi to surrender. By September, all scattered and group bandits in the Dazhu area, totaling 42,000, were annihilated, and rural political power was further consolidated. Later, I was transferred to the position of Chief of Staff of the East Sichuan Military Region. After the surrender of the Nationalist 18th Army Corps in the Chengdu Campaign, they were reorganized into the East Sichuan Military Region troops. Corps Commander Li Zhen and Deputy Commander Lu Chongyi served as deputy commanders of the East Sichuan Military Region. I, in accordance with Comrade Deng's teachings on the essence of the united front being to unite the majority, actively and proactively discussed work with them and sought their opinions, and for a long time, we maintained a friendly relationship.

Comrade Deng's report, although nearly 40 years have passed, still has strong vitality. In the past war years, if bureaucracy and privileges were practiced, and the masses were alienated, they would be defeated by the enemy. At that time, being a Party member meant consciously enduring hardships for the people and the revolution, even shedding blood and sacrificing. The situation is different now. Our Party has become the ruling party. Forty years of peace and forty years of development have indeed made some comrades unable to withstand the test of ruling. Some comrades who have passed the life-and-death test of blood and fire cannot pass the peaceful test of flowers. They are invaded by the corrupt thoughts of the exploiting class, kneel before money, forget righteousness for profit, indulge in luxury and corruption, embezzle public funds for private gain, and seriously damage the Party's prestige, corrupt the Party's style, and violate the Party's discipline. The broad masses of the people are extremely dissatisfied with this. Today, by studying this report again, we can summarize the past, consider the future, always keep a clear mind, better adhere to the style of modesty and pragmatism, and better unite the broad masses around the Party to work together for socialist modernization construction.

Comrade Xiaoping's thought of eliminating corruption is consistent. Combining his personal experience, whether in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu or in Central China, especially after victory, Comrade Xiaoping always emphasized the importance of maintaining and carrying forward the style of hard work and modesty advocated by Chairman Mao Zedong. He repeatedly taught us that the Communist Party is dedicated to serving the people, so it must have a pure style. He was strict with himself and never sought special treatment in life. Not long after Chongqing was liberated, due to the long-term rule of the Nationalists, the people's livelihood was in ruins, and all industries were waiting to be revived. He especially emphasized that houses should be crowded together, and more houses should be rented out to increase state revenue. As the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Southwest and the political commissar of the Southwest Military Region, he lived with Liu Bocheng, the chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and Cai Shufan, the chairman of the Southwest General Federation of Trade Unions, in an old two-story building. He often reminded us, "As a Communist, one should put work in the first place and not care about enjoyment. One should understand that our life cannot be separated from the life of society." A unit used a convenient flight to carry ham, and Comrade Deng learned about it and immediately ordered the unit's leadership to make a deep self-examination and gave serious treatment to the main responsible person. For high-level cadres, Comrade Deng required even stricter standards. A division-level cadre who had performed military exploits but sought enjoyment and corruption after entering the city caused a bad impact on the Party's prestige and was eventually expelled from the Party. In today's reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly warned the whole Party that if we do not pay attention to firmly grasping the anti-corruption struggle, we may destroy a part of the Party members and cadres; he repeatedly emphasized that the key to rectifying the Party's style is to grasp the leading cadres at all levels. In November 1979, in his report "Senior Cadres Should Take the Lead in Carrying Forward the Party's Fine Traditions" at the meeting of senior Party, government, and military cadres, he sharply criticized some leading cadres for acting like officials and lords, seeking special treatment, "detaching from the masses, detaching from cadres, even corrupting their children and families, and bringing the atmosphere down," and spoke very thoroughly and profoundly about preventing corruption, being clean and upright, and carrying forward the Party's fine traditions. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion achieved decisive victory, Comrade Xiaoping once again emphasized, "This Party must be grasped, it cannot be delayed any longer."

Today, we study and implement Comrade Xiaoping's report on "Overcoming Current Bad Tendencies in the West South Party," and first of all, we must be clear in our minds that maintaining integrity and preventing corruption is not only the minimum requirement for a Communist but also not determined by anyone's subjective will. It is because the Communist Party leads China's reform and opening up, shoulders the historical mission of socialist modernization construction, and faces the severe tests of ruling and reform and opening up. It is the inevitable requirement of the Party's historical mission and leadership responsibility, and one of the fundamental marks that distinguish it from all other parties. We must fully realize that the struggle against corruption is long-term and arduous. At any time, Communists cannot relax their ideological vigilance, cannot abandon the ideological weapon of criticism and self-criticism, the transformation of worldview cannot stop for a moment, and the style of hard struggle must never be abandoned. Communist Party members, especially high-level cadres, must consciously accept the supervision of the masses, take the lead in being clean and upright, take the lead in hard struggle, and always set an example for the broad cadres and masses. Comrade Xiaoping often reminded us, "Let the masses supervise, there is only benefit, no harm," because the highest interest of Communists is to serve the people wholeheartedly, and there is no other private interest. For the power entrusted by the people, we must, like the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, remember that the higher the position, the heavier the responsibility, and the higher the position, the more we must remember the heart of a public servant, and regard being clean and upright as the foundation of our political life.

"Reviewing the past heroes and families, success comes from thrift and failure comes from extravagance." In the new historical period, we re-study Comrade Xiaoping's report and deeply feel that his thoughts and views have strong theoretical and practical significance, strong policy and targeted significance, and a strong momentum. As long as we consciously and creatively implement these thoughts in practical work, our Party can always maintain vitality and vigor, and our Party members and cadres can become social servants trusted by the broad masses.

    邓政委带领我们过好胜利关
    ——重新学习邓小平同志关于克服西南党内不良倾向的报告
    何正文
    最近，由中央文献研究室编辑、人民出版社出版的《邓小平文选》是一部贯穿着实事求是和理论联系实际的马列主义、毛泽东思想的科学著作。《文选》收集了小平同志从1938年到1965年期间的重要讲话和文献，其中有不少篇章过去曾学习过，有不少讲话过去曾亲耳聆听过，现在重新学习，倍感亲切。特别是小平同志1950年6月6日在中共重庆市第2次代表会议上所作的关于《克服目前西南党内的不良倾向》的报告，深深地吸引着我，使我更加体会到这篇光辉论著不但具有不可磨灭的历史意义，而且对当前和今后加强党的思想建设、保持和发扬党的优良作风有着十分重要的指导意义。
    1949年11月，第2野战军第3兵团遵照野战军刘伯承司令员、邓小平政委的命令，和友邻部队密切配合，将国民党军3万余人歼灭于南川以北，乘胜解放了西南重镇——重庆。当时，我任3兵团第32师师长。翌年初春，我32师完成了重庆警备任务后，即奉命开赴大竹地区执行剿匪反霸、建立和巩固农村政权的任务。但是，在全国胜利面前，我们队伍里有一部分同志开始滋长贪图安逸和享乐思想，不愿到艰苦边远地区去开辟工作，认为“我们解放了重庆，就该留下来享受城市生活了”，有的同志在生活上闹优待，住房要住好房子，没有电灯的房子还不愿住。一些党员干部居功自傲，脱离群众，看不起党外进步人士，官僚主义严重，特别是个别领导干部经受不起胜利的考验，开始出现蜕化、腐朽思想和行为。这些问题，都极大地损害了党的威信，破坏了党的凝聚力，严重地影响着党的工作重心转移、剿匪和土改任务的完成。
    针对胜利后党内思想上出现的各种各样的问题，小平同志遵照毛泽东主席关于要进行第3次整风的精神，立足全局，在报告中总结了前2次党内整风的经验教训，充分说明了这次整风的必要性和重要性，鲜明地提出：“我们面临3万万人口的新区，干部又比较分散，发生的问题很多，这些问题不解决就不能前进，所以必须整风”。对整风中主要抓什么？小平同志一针见血地指出，“一个是统一战线中的关门主义，一个是正在发展的蜕化、腐朽思想”。他认为：只有首先从党的干部特别是领导干部自身做起，坚决克服特殊化、腐化和官僚主义，才能增强党的凝聚力和战斗力，团结大多数，开辟新的工作。他深刻阐述了发扬党的优良作风的极端重要性，强调：西南工作的根扎得正不正，就看共产党干部的作风正不正，“如果作风不正，根扎歪了，就会贻害无穷。”他严肃批评了少数党的干部出现的脱离群众、官僚主义和腐化行为，并进一步说明了坚持党的统一战线的必要性，指出“如果抛弃了统一战线，革命还要遭受损失”，如果“不把百分之八十的人团结好，能够做好工作吗？小圈子主义的危险性，难道还不明显吗？”小平同志还如实地分析了产生蜕化、腐朽的思想根源，要求在新的形势下更要坚持从严治党，告诫全体党员特别是党的领导干部要过好胜利关。在紧张的剿匪斗争中，我们师党委认真传达和学习了邓政委的报告，深刻感到小平同志把毛泽东思想与西南的实际相结合，紧紧抓住了胜利后党内出现的要害问题，他的报告是毛泽东同志建党思想的继承和发展。我们以邓政委的报告统一思想，边剿匪边整风，首先从我们师的主要领导同志检查起，教育全体党员克服一切享乐思想和腐蚀思想。部队通过传达教育，对一些同志出现的腐化思想和无纪律现象，深入进行了批评与自我批评，有一名曾立过大功但胜利后追求享受的同志深有感触的说：“要当共产党，就得一辈子为人民着想，一辈子艰苦奋斗”。师党委决定，对有严重蜕化、腐化行为的党员，不论战斗中功劳多大，都坚决按照党纪给予了严肃处理。当时，在兵团范围内少数高级干部，有的被开除党籍，有的被留党察看或撤销职务，有的给予记大过处分。这次整风，对部队振动很大，挽救了一大批党员干部，许多党外人士看到了共产党是真心实意为人民服务的，自觉地积极为党开展工作。我32师在对土匪实施强大军事打击的同时，一方面整顿、纯洁党员队伍的思想和组织，一方面深入群众，发动匪属，团结上层进步人士，先后迫使以曹老儿为首的大小4股土匪缴械投降。截至9月，全歼了大竹地区散匪、股匪共4.2万余人，农村政权进一步巩固。后来，我调任川东军区参谋长，在成都战役中起义的国民党第18兵团经过改造后，当时已编入川东军区部队，兵团司令官李振、副司令官鲁崇义两将军任川东军区副司令员，我遵照邓政委关于统一战线的本质就是团结大多数的教导，积极主动地与他们商量工作，征求意见，直到后来很久我们之间仍然保持着友好的关系。
    邓政委的这篇报告至今虽然近40年了，但仍然有着很强的生命力。过去战争年代，如果搞官僚主义、搞特权，脱离群众，就会被敌人打垮。那时候，做为一名党员就意味着要自觉地为人民、为革命吃苦，甚至流血牺牲。现在情况不同了，我们党成了执政党，40年的和平，40年的发展，在党内的确有一些同志经受不起执政的考验，有的同志闯过了血与火的生死关，却过不了摆满鲜花的和平关，他们受到剥削阶级腐朽思想的侵袭，拜倒在金钱脚下，见利忘义，奢侈腐化，贪赃枉法，损公肥私，严重地损害了党的威性，败坏了党的作风，败坏了党的纪律。对此，广大人民群众是极为不满的。今天重新学习这篇报告，可以使我们总结过去，考虑未来，始终保持清醒的头脑，更好地坚持谦逊朴素和实事求是的作风，更好地把广大群众凝聚在党的周围同心同德地进行社会主义现代化建设。
    小平同志铲除腐化的思想是一贯的。结合自己的亲身经历，不论是在晋冀鲁豫，还是在中原，特别是取得胜利以后，小平同志都十分强调保持和发扬毛泽东主席倡导的艰苦朴素和谦逊谨慎的思想、工作作风，他不止一次地教导我们：共产党是一心一意为人民服务的，因此必须具有纯正的作风。他严于律己，在生活上从不搞特殊，重庆解放不久，由于国民党的长期统治，弄得民生凋敝，百业待兴，他特别强调房子要挤着住，多的房子拿去出租，以增加国库收入，他身为中共中央西南局第一书记、西南军区政委，与西南军政委员会主席刘伯承、西南总工会主席蔡树蕃同挤在一栋陈旧的两层小楼的房子里住。他时常告诫我们：“作为一个共产党员，要把工作放在第一位，不应当计较享受。要弄清楚，我们的生活不能脱离社会的生活水准。”有个单位利用顺便飞机带火腿，邓政委得知后，立即明令这个单位的领导作出深刻检查，并对主要责任者给予了严肃处理。对高级干部，邓政委要求更加严格，有个师级干部立过战功，但进城后追求享受，腐化堕落，给党的威信造成极坏影响，最后被清除出党。在改革开放的今天，小平同志多次告诫全党，不重视坚持抓好反腐蚀斗争，就可能毁掉一部分党员干部；他反复强调，端正党风的关键，是抓好各级领导干部。1979年11月，他在党政军高级干部会议上所作的《高级干部要带头发扬党的优良传统》的报告中，尖锐地批评少数领导干部做官当老爷，搞特殊化，“脱离群众，脱离干部，甚至腐蚀自己的子女和家庭，把风气带坏了”，对防止腐败，廉洁奉公，发扬党的优良传统，讲得十分透彻、精辟。平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利后，小平同志又一次强调指出，“这个党该抓了，不抓不行了。”
    今天，我们学习、贯彻小平同志关于《克服目前西南党内的不良倾向》的报告，首先要在思想上充分明确，保持廉洁，防止腐败，这不仅仅是共产党员的起码条件，也不是由谁的主观意志所决定的，而是因为共产党领导着中国的改革开放事业，担负着中国社会主义现代化建设的历史重任，面临着执政与改革开放的严峻考验，是党的历史使命和领导责任的必然要求，是区别于一切政党的根本标志之一。要充分看到与腐败现象作斗争是长期的、艰巨的。任何时候，共产党人都不能解除思想武装，都不能丢掉批评与自我批评的思想武器，世界观的改造一刻也不能停，艰苦奋斗的作风永远也不能丢。共产党员特别是党的高级干部要自觉地接受群众监督，带头廉洁奉公，带头艰苦奋斗，时时处处做广大干部群众的表率。小平同志时常提醒我们“让群众来监督，只有好处，没有坏处”，因为共产党人的最高利益是全心全意为人民服务，除此毫无任何私利。对人民赋予的权力，要像毛泽东、周恩来、邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家那样，权高不忘责任重，位尊不忘公仆心，把为政清廉做为自己的政治生命之本。
    “历览前贤国与家，成由勤俭败由奢”。在新的历史时期，我们重新学习小平同志的这篇报告，深感他的思想和观点有很强的理论性和实践性，有很强的政策性和针对性，有一股所向披靡的锐气。只要我们自觉地、创造性地把这些思想贯彻于实际工作中，我们的党就能永远保持生机和活力，我们的党员干部就能成为广大人民群众所信赖的社会公仆。
