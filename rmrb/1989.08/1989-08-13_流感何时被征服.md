It is well known that influenza is a common disease with significant harm. According to materials published by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics, at least 600,000 people worldwide die from influenza each year. Dr. Frank Perkins, an expert from the World Health Organization, believes that influenza is the infectious disease with the highest actual mortality rate.

The influenza virus has a unique survival capability: it can rapidly produce new variants according to environmental needs, keeping the human body's response in a state of lag and passivity. Although the medical community has conducted relatively systematic research on the three main types of influenza viruses, the vaccines that have been developed cannot guarantee that those who are vaccinated will not contract influenza. They can only alleviate the condition to some extent if one does contract influenza. One vaccine only works against one type of virus, but there are three main types of influenza viruses, and each type has many variants, reaching up to twenty or more. This poses a significant challenge to the correct use of vaccines. For example, last year in Spain, a large batch of influenza vaccines was produced and sold. When the flu season arrived, people discovered that these vaccines did not match the virus causing the outbreak. Even if people use the vaccines correctly, their effectiveness is limited because the virus can form new variants during the course of the disease.

Influenza causes enormous economic losses for various countries. Even in normal years, winter production in Spain is affected by influenza. In light of this, the global medical community has given increasing attention to the issue. Currently, there are two specialized influenza treatment centers worldwide, and more than 100 hospitals in 73 countries are closely monitoring the activity of the influenza virus. However, the news from these medical facilities is not very encouraging.

    流感何时被征服
    众所周知，流感是一种常见病，其危害性大。据西班牙国立统计研究所公布的材料，全世界每年至少有六十万人死于流感。世界卫生组织的一位专家弗朗克·彼尔金斯博士认为，流行性感冒是实际死亡率最高的一种传染性疾病。
    流感病毒具有一种特殊的生存能力：它能够依环境的需要迅速产生新的变体，使人体的反应永远处于落后、被动的状态。目前，医学界虽然对三种主要的流感病毒进行了较为系统的研究，但已经培育出的疫苗也不能保证接种的人不患流感，而只能在患了流感的情况下使病情得到一定的缓解。一种疫苗只对一种病毒起作用，而主要的流感病毒却有三种，而且每一种病毒的种类很多，可达到二十多个。这给正确使用疫苗造成很大的困难。如去年在西班牙生产、销售了一大批流感疫苗，当流感到来时人们才发现，这批疫苗与引起这次流感的病毒没有对上号。即使人们正确地使用了疫苗，它的作用也是有限的，因为病毒有可能在发病的过程中形成新的变体。
    流行性感冒给各国的经济造成巨大损失。仅就西班牙而言，即使是正常的年份，冬季的生产也受到流感的影响。有鉴于此，世界医学界已给予越来越高的重视。目前，全世界已有两个专门治疗流感的医疗中心，另外还有七十三个国家的一百多所医院在密切注视流感病毒的活动。但是，从这些医疗单位传来的消息并不那么令人乐观。
