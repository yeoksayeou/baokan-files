	Parents celebrating their children's admission to university with a banquet is a natural expression of joy. However, when this celebration becomes excessive, it crosses the line. In recent years, the trend of showing off has grown, with "top scorer banquets" becoming increasingly extravagant. Some families host as few as ten tables, while others host as many as twenty or thirty. Some families even go into debt to fund these banquets. Last year, in a certain village, a farmer's son was admitted to Southeast University. The family spent over 1,000 yuan to host a 20-table banquet. When the son saw that other families were hosting even more lavish banquets, he criticized his father for being too stingy. To save face, the old father sold 1,000 pounds of rice and a fat pig to host another 10 tables of a more impressive banquet. Such wasteful displays of extravagance can be seen almost every year and in almost every place.

	The admission of a high school student to a university is just the beginning of their journey to success. As parents, truly loving and caring for one's children means not focusing on extravagant banquets and competitive displays, but rather guiding them to establish a correct outlook on life and a sense of honor. It is important to educate them to continue striving for excellence and to cultivate good habits of hard work, frugality, and thrift. Only in this way can they become builders of socialism in the future.

	As for some teachers, they should not think that the students admitted to universities are their "pillars of the future" and demand gifts or banquets, thereby encouraging this harmful trend.

### 学子入大学　何需“状元宴”

    学子入大学　何需“状元宴”
    家长为自己的孩子考上大学设家宴庆贺，这是人之常情。过分就出格了。近几年，讲排场之风日盛，“状元宴”越搞越大，有的少则十几桌，多则二三十桌。有的家庭为此而负债。去年，某乡有个农民的儿子考取了东南大学，花1000多元办了20桌“状元宴”，儿子见到别家的“状元宴”办得比自家更阔气，便责怪父亲办得太寒酸。为了争面子，老父亲又卖掉1000斤稻谷和一头肥猪，重新办了10桌像样的酒席。类似这样的铺张浪费，可以说几乎年年有，处处有。
    一个高中生考取大学只是成才的开始。作为家长真正爱护自己的子女，决不要在“状元宴”上下功夫，搞攀比，而要引导子女树立正确的人生观和荣誉观，教育他们继续奋发向上并养成艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的良好习惯。这样，将来才能成为社会主义的建设人才。
    至于一些教师，也不要认为高校录取生是自己培养出来的“栋梁之才”而要吃要喝，助长这股歪风。
