According to a survey by the Jinan Municipal Economic Investigation Team, illegal trading of national savings bonds is rampant in Jinan City at present, with most transactions taking place in front of bank exchange points. Unscrupulous brokers, taking advantage of the public's fear of currency devaluation and their desire to convert their national savings bonds into cash, brazenly compete with banks for the market. It is understood that a 1988-issued national savings bond with a face value of 10 yuan can only be exchanged for 7 yuan in cash from scalpers; a 1982-issued bond can only be exchanged for its original value. Since the designated national savings bond exchange points do not exchange bonds that have not yet matured, scalpers seize the opportunity to buy up large quantities of bonds from residents at discounted prices, not only causing economic losses to bondholders but also damaging the credibility of national bonds.

Among the numerous scalpers, most are local residents, with a few from out of town. There are part-time scalpers as well as full-time "bond speculators." They frequently buy and sell bonds. In January this year, several buyers from Beijing came to Jinan and bought 70,000 yuan worth of national savings bonds from scalpers in one go, making a profit in the process.

In the latter half of last year, the Jinan Municipal Government organized a crackdown, but the problem was not resolved, leading to the resurgence of black market trading of national savings bonds. (July 20, Market News, by Luo Chunbo)

### 济南国库券黑市交易猖獗

    济南国库券黑市交易猖獗
    据济南市社会经济调查队调查，目前，济南市国库券非法交易十分猖獗，交易所多在银行兑换点门前。不法经纪人抓住人们普遍担心货币贬值、急于把手中国库券变为现金的心理，明目张胆地和银行争夺交易市场。据了解，一张1988年发行的10元面值的国库券在票贩子手中只能兑换7元现金；1982年发行的也仅能换回原值。由于国家指定的国库券交易所不兑换还未到期的国库券，于是票贩子乘机大量压价从居民手中套购，不仅使国库券持有者经济受损，而且破坏了国家债券的信誉。
    在众多的票贩子队伍中，本市人为主，也有少数外地人。有业余贩子，也有专职的“票倒”。他们频繁地买进卖出。今年1月份，几个北京买主来济南，从票贩子手中一次买去了7万元国库券，从中渔利。
    去年下半年，济南市府曾组织进行过打击，但未能解决问题，致使国库券黑市交易又复猖獗。（7月20日《市场报》  罗春波文）
