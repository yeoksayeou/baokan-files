Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd.

    The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Union, Maslyukov, reported to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 3rd regarding the basic concept for the 1990 Soviet economic and social development plan. According to his report, the important tasks for the Soviet economy and social development plan for next year are to alleviate the deterioration of the economic situation, ease social tensions, overcome economic imbalances and inflation, stabilize the consumer market, and make the fiscal situation healthier. By the beginning of this year, Soviet national debt had reached 312 billion rubles, with a deficit of 120 billion rubles, and foreign debt of 34 billion rubles, all of which continue to rise. Residents' incomes have almost doubled, far outpacing the growth rate of civilian goods production. Given this situation, the plan for next year has a special significance.

    Maslyukov emphasized that the government plans to take the following measures next year: to increase the production of consumer goods by 12% while the total national product grows by only 2%; to drastically reduce basic construction investments in the production sector; to significantly reduce the construction front; to accelerate the process of converting military enterprises to civilian production; to reduce defense spending and administrative expenses; and to introduce imported goods worth 100 billion rubles into the domestic market. However, the construction of housing, schools, and hospitals will continue to expand. Maslyukov referred to 1990 as a difficult and combative year. He said that the extraordinary economic situation should not cause economic reforms to stall, but rather to continue deepening them. True economic accounting should be implemented in the economic departments of the union republics and regions.

    苏联经济和社会发展计划的构想
    苏联部长会议第一副主席、国家计委主席马斯柳科夫8月3日向苏联最高苏维埃作了有关1990年苏联经济和社会发展计划基本构想的报告。根据他的报告，苏联明年经济和社会发展计划的重要任务是，缓和经济状况的恶化，消除社会紧张局面，克服经济失调和通货膨胀现象，稳定消费市场，使财政趋向健康化。今年年初苏联国债已达3120亿卢布，赤字1200亿卢布，外债340亿卢布，至今仍在上升。居民收入几乎增加一倍，大大超过了民用商品生产的增长速度。鉴于这种情况，明年的计划就具有特别性质。
    马斯柳科夫强调，明年政府拟采取以下措施：在全国总产品只增长2％的情况下，民用消费品的生产计划增长12％；坚决削减生产领域中的基本建设投资；大大压缩建设战线；加速军工企业转为民用生产的进程；减少国防开支和机关管理经费；向国内市场投放零售总值相当于100亿卢布的进口商品。但对住宅、学校和医院的建设仍将继续扩大。马斯柳科夫称1990年为艰难的、战斗的一年。他说，非常的经济形势不应当使经济改革停顿下来，而是要继续深化。要在加盟共和国和各州的经济部门实行真正的经济核算。
