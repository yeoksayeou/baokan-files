According to a report from a German astronomy magazine, as early as 1979, astronomers had confirmed that from 1836 to 1953, over a span of more than 100 years, the Sun's diameter had shrunk by at least 2 arcseconds, or in other words, the Sun's volume had decreased by nearly 0.1%. In 1987, the renowned astronomer E. Reppoz conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Sun's micro-variations since 1666. The results indicated that if the Sun's diameter was 32 arcminutes 9 arcseconds between 1666 and 1682, then it must have shrunk by at least 3 arcseconds between 1683 and 1718.

Experts also pointed out that currently, the diameter of our Sun is 31 arcminutes 59.3 arcseconds. Scientists Odel and Heridan from the University of Houston in Texas, USA, hold a different opinion regarding the belief that the Sun is shrinking. They believe that the optical instruments of the medieval period were likely not very sophisticated and precise, which could have led to some discrepancies in the statistical data.

    太阳正在逐渐缩小
    据联邦德国一家天文学杂志报道，还是在1979年的时候，天文学家就已经证实过，从1836年—1953年的100多年时间里，太阳的直径至少缩小了约2角秒，或者说，太阳的体积缩小了近0.1％。1987年，著名天文学家埃·雷波兹对1666年以来太阳的微动变化进行了全面分析。分析的结果表明，如果在1666年—1682年间太阳的直径是32角分9角秒的话，那么在1683年—1718年间至少要缩小3角秒左右。
    专家们还指出，现在，我们的太阳天体直径是31角分59.3角秒。来自美国德克萨斯市休斯敦大学的科学家奥捷尔和赫里德恩对这种认为太阳正在缩小的认识持有一种不同的意见，他们认为，中世纪时期的光学仪器很可能不十分完善和精确，因此，可能会引起一些统计数字上出现的偏差。
