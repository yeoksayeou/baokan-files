Schools should add physical labor courses. In recent years, due to an overemphasis on raising admission rates, some schools have neglected physical labor courses, even eliminating them altogether. If this continues, even students born in rural areas will struggle to distinguish between wheat and beans. Who knows the true value of the food on their plates, that every grain of rice and every inch of cloth comes from hard work? It's just a matter of reciting a few lines; it's hard to truly appreciate the effort behind each grain of rice and every inch of cloth. Isn't it true? In recent years, there have been serious instances of waste in primary schools, middle schools, and universities. For example: clothes are discarded as soon as they are slightly worn or no longer to one's liking; uneaten food is thrown away; a bite is taken from a steamed bun and then it's tossed; the skin is peeled off a steamed bun before eating it. There have been numerous reports of such incidents on the radio and in newspapers. I believe that the root cause of these problems, aside from the influence of the high-consumption trend, is that students have been detached from physical labor for too long and lack personal experience. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments of the Party and government do their best to help schools establish production plots and add physical labor courses for students; or regularly organize students to go to factories and rural areas to participate in production and experience life.

### 学校应增设体力劳动课

    学校应增设体力劳动课
    近些年，由于片面地追求升学率，一些学校忽视了体力劳动课，甚至把它给砍掉了。长此以往，就是出生在农村的学生也禾菽难分了。谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦，也只能是吟诵一下而已，很难真正体味到每粒粮食、每尺棉布都来之不易。不是吗？近几年在小学、中学、大学里都出现了严重的浪费现象。例如：衣服旧了，甚至稍不称心就随手扔了；菜不可口转身就泼，包子咬一口就抛，馒头揭了皮再吃，类似这方面的报道电台、报纸都已不少。俺认为之所以出现这么多不良现象，除了受高消费浪潮的冲击外，一个最根本的原因，就在于学生们长期脱离体力劳动，缺乏亲身体验。因此，俺建议，党和政府有关部门尽可能地帮助学校建立一些生产园地，给学生增设体力劳动课；或者定期组织学生到工厂去、到农村去，参加生产劳动，体验生活。
