Late spring and early summer, the skies over the capital were filled with turmoil, and a wave of dark clouds and mist enveloped Beijing, spreading towards Wuhan.

“Wuhan Steel workers go on strike, Li Peng step down!”
“Wuhan Steel halts production, Guan Guangfu (Hubei Provincial Committee Secretary) surrenders!”
“As long as the 140,000 Wuhan Steel workers take the lead, all the workers in the city will go on a general strike!”

Batch after batch of students, unaware of the truth, were manipulated by a few bad elements, surging towards Wuhan Steel from all directions.

Wuhan Steel was facing a test. The nation was watching Wuhan Steel.

“At this critical moment, leaders at all levels should have a clear mind and stand firmly with the Party Central Committee. They should organize workers to study the April 26 editorial of the People’s Daily, using various forms to guide workers to distinguish truth from falsehood, clarify right from wrong, and educate the masses to understand a simple truth: staying at the post and continuing production is patriotism; causing turmoil and disrupting production is absolutely not patriotism!” General Manager and Party Secretary Huang Mobi spoke on behalf of the 140,000 Wuhan Steel workers.

The company announced: “From now on, administrative staff will work half a day and study half a day; workers will use the time between shifts to ensure at least one hour of study per day.” The decision was initially met with some workers whispering: the roads to work are still blocked, and the crowds at the factory gates are still inciting a strike, demanding negotiations with company leaders. The situation was extremely urgent, who had the heart to sit down and study? However, as time passed and the situation developed, the workers increasingly felt that this special decision was indeed very important! The half-day study regulation allowed Wuhan Steel workers to sit down and calmly think about what the Central Committee said, and objectively evaluate the credibility of various rumors.

However, just handing over the guiding principles to the workers was not enough. A strict guiding system needed to be organized to timely guide the workers with the spirit of the Central Committee, so as to effectively help everyone see through various lies, distinguish truth from falsehood, and clarify right from wrong, thereby achieving unity of thought and unity of purpose. To this end, Wuhan Steel Company and the factory mines at two levels each set up two teams. Some leaders were in charge of daily production and logistics; the main party and government leaders (who were also the directors and deputy directors of the ideological and political work committees at two levels) formed an “emergency leadership group,” under which an “emergency office” was established, and under it, nine groups were set up for ideological information, propaganda, factory protection, and ideological and political work for student representatives. At the same time, Wuhan Steel fully utilized the advantages of its political and ideological work system, from the company party committee to the workshop and team ideological and political work teams, boldly carried out ideological education for the workers, forming a complete guiding system. Under the command of the Wuhan Steel Party Committee, a majestic symphony of ideological guidance was composed.

Movement One: Macro Guidance Clarifies the Truth

During the days of resisting the turmoil, someone said that Shougang had stopped production and gone on strike, with all workers taking to the streets. The company’s emergency leadership group immediately picked up the direct-dial phone and called Shougang, which replied: No! The news was immediately reported to the masses.

The “Voice of America” broadcasted news of “rivers of blood” in Beijing, which coincidentally spread in the steel city that a certain worker’s child studying in Beijing had been killed. The company immediately sent someone to investigate, and the person who came out to meet them was the university student himself...

Huang Mobi and other party and government leaders of Wuhan Steel repeatedly answered the questions raised by the workers at various meetings and educated the workers with facts.

The company party committee deputy secretary in charge of propaganda and external liaison, Wen Bicong, accurately and timely conveyed the spirit of the higher-level party organization to the heads of secondary units, word for word, and then quickly passed it down layer by layer.

This guidance clarified truth from falsehood and guided the workers to believe in the Party and the government. The workers said: Protecting Wuhan Steel and continuing production is our responsibility. If Wuhan Steel stops production for one day, it will lose 5 million yuan in taxes. Throwing away so much money is patriotism? An old worker said: “It’s the common people who suffer in chaos! It can’t be chaotic! It’s better to be stable!” A middle-aged worker said: “No matter what, these years of reform have increased my income. If this continues, this year’s income will be greatly reduced. Besides, if production stops, there will be no gas, no water, and nothing to cook!”

At that time, some people did not understand why Wuhan Steel workers insisted on production, and even rumors spread that Wuhan Steel was giving high bonuses for attending work (from 10 yuan to 500 yuan). The director and party secretary of Wuhan Steel Ironworks, Li Chunhai, told the workers: Outside, they say that our ironworks workers get 5 yuan for attending work, what do you all think? Isn’t this too underestimating our ironworks workers? Our ironworks have never been chaotic, the stability and unity of the factory are not bought with money, but rely on the consciousness of the working class!

Movement Two: Specific Guidance Needs Heart-to-Heart

For the ideological guidance of specific people and specific events, Wuhan Steel’s approach can be divided into two categories.

One category is preventive guidance. A young worker in Wuhan Steel’s No. 1 Steel Plant had been in and out of the public security bureau several times. After the turmoil spread to Wuhan Steel, his group leader repeatedly talked to him, hoping that as a member of the working class, he would guard his work post and contribute to the first-class indicators of the group this year. The young worker’s heart warmed, and he did not miss a single day of work during the entire turmoil. The group had no defective products, and the quality and quantity of the products were at the forefront of the same profession. He lived in Hankou, and when the traffic was blocked, he had to spend 3 hours walking to the Yangtze River to take a boat, sometimes thinking of going to listen to speeches and watch the excitement on the way, but thinking of the group leader’s expectations and trust, he finally held back.

The other category is inspirational guidance. Party Secretary Huang Mobi repeatedly paid tribute to the broad masses of workers who insisted on attending work and production at various meetings, praising them for having high patriotic enthusiasm and being worthy members of the Chinese working class. The coking plant hung a large banner at the entrance: Saluting the comrades who endure hardships and insist on attending work! The leaders of the No. 2 Steel Plant took turns visiting the workstations to comfort the workers and solve practical difficulties. Many factories held various forms of commendation meetings and lectures, vigorously publicizing the deeds of these comrades. Under the influence of the majority of workers, some who originally thought they could take a few days off work due to the students blocking the traffic also could not sit at home, finding ways to come to work, some detouring around East Lake, trekking for dozens of kilometers; some seeking help from nearby farmers to borrow boats to cross the river; some swinging like acrobats across the river; and some young men simply swam across the river to work. During this period, many touching stories emerged: An old worker came to a roadblock set up by students and first took out cigarettes to offer to the students, hoping they would let him pass. But a malicious person said: “Just shout ‘Down with the Communist Party’ and you can pass.” The old worker heard this, his eyes blazing with anger, spat on the ground, and turned to leave. There was also a young worker, tall and strong, who easily lifted his bicycle high above his head, trying to squeeze past the small bridge blocked by students. But “bang!” someone locked his bicycle, and then the key was thrown into the river. The young man, in a fit of anger, pushed his bicycle into the river with both hands. “Splash!” With the high splash of water, everyone on the bridge was stunned. In the silence, the young man shouted: “Make way!” The students involuntarily opened a path, and the young worker walked through the crowd, not looking back, and went to work.

Movement Three: External Guidance Needs to Strike Out

Wuhan Steel’s factory area is large and extensive. To actively do a good job in the ideological and political work of the workers, the factory organized ideological and political work guidance teams to take the initiative to strike out, which was beneficial to educating their own workers and also to help the deceived students wake up quickly.

On the afternoon of June 7, around 3 pm, someone spread rumors at the No. 16 gate of Wuhan Steel that three people had been killed on the bridge. The more than 20 students gathered at the gate immediately wanted to rush the gate, block the railway, and obstruct the slag cars. The workers of the protection team patiently persuaded them, pointing out their gullibility and rashness, and finally convinced them. Fifteen minutes later, they all left.

Another time, a foreman of the ironworks asked the student leader blocking the intersection why they did not let the workers go to work. The student replied that they hoped the workers would support their actions to fight for democracy and freedom. The foreman retorted: “You don’t let us go to work, is this democracy? Isn’t this also depriving us of our labor freedom?” The student leader had no words to reply and had to let the workers go to work.

During those turbulent days, Wuhan Steel still maintained a good production situation, completing the contracted indicators for iron, steel, and steel products.

After experiencing this storm, the people of Wuhan Steel became stronger, and the majestic steel city still stood on the banks of the Yangtze River.

    思想导向协奏曲
    ——武钢职工反动乱纪实
    陈林平
    春末夏初，首都上空一时乱云翻滚，一股股阴云黑雾，笼罩了北京，涌向了武汉。
    “武钢罢工，李鹏下台！”
    “武钢停产，关广富（湖北省委书记）投降！”
    “只要武钢14万人带头，全市工人就会实行总罢工！”
    一批批不明真相的学生，在极少数坏人的操纵下，从四面八方涌向武钢。
    武钢，面临考验。全国人民关注武钢。
    “各级领导在大是大非面前应该头脑清醒，旗帜鲜明地与党中央保持一致，认真组织职工学习《人民日报》4月26日社论，采用多种形式，有针对性地引导职工辨明真假，弄清是非，教育群众认识一个简单的道理：坚守岗位、坚持生产就是爱国；搞动乱、破坏生产，绝对不是爱国！”总经理兼党委书记黄墨滨代表武钢14万工人表态了。
    公司宣布：“从现在起，机关干部错开安排，半天工作，半天学习；工人利用交接班间隔时间保证每天至少学习一小时。”决定初颁，一些职工窃窃私议：上班的路还堵着，堵在工厂大门的人群还在鼓动罢工，要求同公司领导“谈判”。情况万分危急，谁还有心思坐下来学习呢？！然而，随着时间的推移和事态的发展，职工们愈来愈感到，这个特别决定真是太重要了！半天学习的规定，可以使武钢人坐下来冷静地想一想中央是怎么说的，客观地评一评五花八门的谣言的可信度。
    不过，仅仅把导向标交给职工还不够，还要组织一个严密的导向体系，及时地用中央的精神对职工进行引导，这样才能有效地帮助大家识破各种谎言，辨明真假，分清黑白，从而做到思想统一，万众一心。为此，武钢公司、厂矿两级都分别成立了两套班子。部分领导主持日常生产及后勤工作；党政工主要领导（他们也分别是两级思想政治工作委员会的主任、副主任）组成“应急领导小组”，下设“应急办公室”，其下又分别成立了思想信息、宣传、护厂以及学生代表思想政治工作等9个组。与此同时，武钢还充分发挥政治思想工作体制上的优势，从公司党委到车间、班组思想政治工作班子，理直气壮地抓职工的思想教育，形成一个完整的导向体系。在武钢党委指挥下，谱写了威武雄壮的思想导向协奏曲。
    乐章之一：宏观导向明大理
    在反对动乱的日子里，有人说，首钢已经停产罢工，工人全都上街。公司应急领导小组立即拿起直拨电话接通首钢，答曰：否！于是马上向广大职工通报真情。
    《美国之音》广播北京血流成河的“消息”，恰好钢城盛传某职工在北京上学的孩子被打死，公司派人立即登门查访，出门迎接的竟是这位大学生……
    黄墨滨等武钢党政工领导同志一次又一次在各种会上就职工提出的问题一一作了回答，并用事实教育了职工。
    负责宣传和对外联络的公司党委副书记文必聪准确及时地将上级党组织的精神一字不漏地传达给二级单位负责人，然后迅速层层下达。
    这种导向明辨真假，引导职工相信党、相信政府。广大职工说：保护武钢、坚持生产是我们的责任。武钢停一天产，要损失500万元的利税。把大把大把的钱扔到水里去，能算爱国吗？一位老工人说：“乱起来还是老百姓遭殃呀！乱不得！还是安定好！”一位中年工人说：“不管怎么说，这几年改革，我的收入还是增加了的，再这么闹下去，今年的收入就要大大减少。再说，停了产，煤气没得，水也没得，拿么事弄饭吃？”
    当时一些，人对武钢职工坚持生产不理解，甚至有人谣传武钢发高额上班奖（从10元一直到500元）。武钢炼铁厂厂长兼党委书记李春海对职工讲：外面说我们铁厂工人上一天班给5块钱“安定奖”，大家说说，这不是太小看咱们铁厂工人吗？我们铁厂从来没乱过，工厂的安定团结不是花钱买的，靠的是工人阶级的觉悟！
    乐章之二：具体导向靠贴心
    对于具体人和具体事的思想导向，武钢的做法可分为两类。
    一类是预防性导向。武钢一炼钢厂有一名青年工人，曾经几进几出公安局。动乱波及到武钢以后，他所在小组组长担心他被这场动乱卷进去，反复找他谈心。希望他作为工人阶级的一员坚守工作岗位，为今年小组各项指标创一流水平作出贡献。这位青工听了心里热乎乎的，在整个动乱期间未缺一天勤。小组生产无废品，产品质量和数量都名列同工种的前茅。他家住汉口，交通受阻时，每天要花3个小时走到长江边乘船，有时在路上也想去听听演讲，看看热闹，但想想组长的希望和信赖，终于忍住了。
    另一类是激励性导向。党委书记黄墨滨多次在大会上向坚持上班、坚持生产的广大职工致敬，赞扬他们具有高度的爱国热情，不愧为中国工人阶级的一员。焦化厂在门口拉起一条大横幅：向克制困难、坚持上班的同志们致敬！二炼厂领导轮流到岗位上慰问工人，解决实际困难。许多厂都召开了各种形式的表彰会、演讲会，大力宣传这些同志的事迹。在大多数职工的影响下，一部分原来以为可以乘学生堵塞交通之机歇两天工的也在家里坐不住了，想方设法来上班，有的绕道东湖，长途跋涉十几公里；有的向附近农民求援借船渡河；有的像杂技演员一样荡着秋千过河；还有的小伙子干脆顶着衣服游水上班。其间涌现了许许多多感人的事迹：一位老工人来到被学生设路障挡住的路口时，先是掏出香烟请学生们吸，希望他们能放行。谁知一个别有用心的家伙说：“只要你喊一声‘打倒共产党’就让过去。”老工人一听，气得两眼冒火，狠狠地朝地上吐了一口口水，扭头就走了。还有一位青年工人，长得身高马大，毫不费力地把自己的自行车高高举起来，想从被学生堵塞的小桥上挤过去。谁知“啪”的一声，不知是谁把他的车锁上了，接着车钥匙又被扔进了河里，小伙子一怒之下，双手猛力一推，把自己的自行车也扔到河里去了。“扑通！”随着高高溅起的水柱，桥上所有的人都楞了。在一片寂静中，小伙子大喝一声：“让路！”学生们不由自主地闪开了一条道，这位青年工人穿过人墙，头也不回上班去了。
    乐章之三：对外导向要出击
    武钢厂区大，范围广。为了主动做好职工的思想政治工作，厂里组织思想政治工作疏导队主动出击，这样做既有利于教育自己的职工，也能使受骗的学生尽快醒悟。
    6月7日下午3时许，武钢16号门前有人造谣说大桥上打死了3个人。聚集在门前的20多名学生当即便要冲大门，堵铁路，阻挡翻渣罐。护厂队的职工耐心劝阻，指出他们的轻信与鲁莽，终于说服了他们，一刻钟后便全部离去。
    还有一次，炼铁厂的一位炉长问堵在路口的学生领队为什么不让职工上班？学生回答说，希望你们支持我们争取民主和自由的行动。炉长反问道：“你们不让我们上班，这是民主吗？这不是也剥夺了我们的劳动自由吗？”带队的学生无言以对，只好让开路让职工上班。
    在那动乱的日子里，武钢仍然保持了较好的生产形势，铁、钢、钢材均完成了承包指标。
    经历了这场风雨的洗礼，武钢人变得更坚强了，雄伟的钢城依然屹立在长江之滨。
