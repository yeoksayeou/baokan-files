Representatives from the six provinces and three cities of the Mid-South Economic and Technological Cooperation Zone recently gathered in Nanning for their fifth joint conference. The overall assessment of the cooperation zone's performance over the past year is that horizontal economic collaboration has "begun to show a regional and open economic new pattern."

As members of the Mid-South Cooperation Zone, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Guangxi, Hainan, and the cities of Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen each have their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of geography, resources, technology, and capital. These nine previously independent regions have now come together to form a large stage with ample opportunities. Each side has already taken on their roles. Guangxi has a natural advantage in developing the sugar industry, but lacks capital and grain, while Hubei has an abundance of grain but lacks sugar. Guangxi has thus collaborated with Hubei, introducing capital to implement a sugar-grain exchange, benefiting both sides.

Since the last joint conference in May of last year, the cooperation zone has implemented over a thousand collaborative projects. This cooperation zone, established and developed during the period of reform and opening up, is currently forming a four-tiered regional collaboration network: county-to-county, city-to-city, adjacent provincial regions, and province-to-province. The scope and depth of the collaboration have also seen new developments. The joint development of the Hongshui River hydroelectric resources by Guangdong and Guangxi is a notable large-scale collaboration project.

At this joint conference, attention was again focused on new areas of cooperation. Among these, fully utilizing the resource advantages of the Mid-South region to collaborate in developing agricultural production is a new collaborative research topic that has been included in the agenda.

    合作各方互惠　有利共图振兴
    中南协作区拓展横向联合
    本报南宁八月二十七日电　记者郑盛丰报道：中南经济技术协作区六省区三市代表日前聚首南宁，举行第五次联席会议。人们对协作区过去一年的总体评价是：横向经济联合“已初步呈现出区域性、开放性的经济新格局”。
    作为中南协作区成员的广东、湖北、湖南、河南、广西、海南六省区和广州、武汉、深圳三市，在地理、物产、技术、资金等方面各有优劣。九个各自为政的区域如今合成一个大有用武之地的大舞台，各方都已进入角色。广西有发展蔗糖业的天然优势，但资金不足，粮食不足，而湖北缺糖，有粮。广西便与湖北合作，引进资金实行糖粮互补，两相有利。
    仅自去年五月上次联席会至今，协作区就实施联合协作项目一千多个。在改革开放中建立和发展起来的这一协作区，目前正形成县县之间、地市之间、省际毗邻地区之间和省省之间四个层次的区域联合协作网络。而协作内容、广度和深度都有新发展。两广联合开发红水河水电资源，就是令人瞩目的大协作项目。
    在这次联席会议上，人们又把目光投向新的协作领域。其中充分利用中南地区资源优势协作发展农业生产，就是一个已列入议题的协作攻关新课题。
