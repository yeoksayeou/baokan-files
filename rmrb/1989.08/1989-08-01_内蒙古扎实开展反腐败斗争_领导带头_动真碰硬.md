Yesterday, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region took serious action against four department-level officials, including Guo Jimin, Deputy Director and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region's Agricultural Commission, for their involvement in bureaucratism, speculation, and other disciplinary and legal violations.

This round of anti-corruption campaign in Inner Mongolia has two distinct features: first, it starts from the top, with leading organs and officials setting an example by maintaining their own integrity to promote the region's overall anti-corruption efforts. Second, it is both loud and effective, taking real actions and tackling tough issues head-on.

The leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region believes that to fight corruption, leaders must first be upright themselves. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee immediately held a democratic life meeting. Each member thoroughly examined their own issues related to party discipline and made the "Decision of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region Party Committee on Strengthening Party Spirit, Maintaining Integrity, and Combating Corruption." The General Office of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the General Office of the Government also issued the "Several Regulations on Resolutely Stopping the Trend of Excessive Banqueting," and published these regulations in newspapers to allow the broad masses of cadres and the people across the region to supervise them. The leaders of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Government set an example first, supervising one level below them, and each level taking responsibility. The party's disciplinary inspection departments, administrative inspection departments, and public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs worked together to investigate and handle 2,810 cases of disciplinary and legal violations, closing 1,688 cases, and punishing 1,424 individuals with party, administrative, or legal disciplinary actions. Among them, 46 were department-level or county-level officials. The anti-corruption campaign in Inner Mongolia has created a certain atmosphere.

    内蒙古扎实开展反腐败斗争
    领导带头　动真碰硬
    本报呼和浩特7月31日电　记者傲腾报道：昨天，内蒙古自治区对自治区农委副主任、党组副书记郭继明等犯有官僚主义、参与、支持倒买倒卖等违纪违法活动的4名厅、局级干部作出了严肃处理。
    内蒙古自治区这一次开展的反腐败斗争有两个明显特点：一是自上而下，领导机关和领导干部率先做出榜样，以自身的廉洁带动全区廉政建设。二是雷声大、雨点也大，动真的，碰硬的。
    内蒙古自治区领导认为：打铁必须自身硬，反腐败必须领导自身廉洁。党的十三届四中全会后，自治区党委常委立即召开民主生活会，每位常委都认真对照检查了自己在党风方面存在的问题，并作出了《自治区党委常委关于增强党性、保持廉洁、反对腐败的若干决定》，自治区党委办公厅和政府办公厅又作出了《关于坚决刹住吃喝风的若干规定》，并将这些规定公布于报端，让全区广大干部群众监督。自治区党委和政府领导率先作出榜样，一级督促一级，一级抓一级，党的纪检部门、行政检查部门和公检法协同作战，共立案查处违纪违法案件2810起，结案1688起，有1424人分别受到党纪、政纪、法纪处分，其中厅局、县处以上干部46人。内蒙古自治区反腐败的斗争形成了一定的气候。
