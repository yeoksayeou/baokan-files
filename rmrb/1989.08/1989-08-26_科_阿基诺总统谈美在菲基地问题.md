Philippine President Corazon Aquino said on August 25 that regarding the future of U.S. military bases in the Philippines, the government will consider the views of other ASEAN countries, but will make decisions based on the national interests of the Philippines.

A total of 23 senators, including 12 who signed a joint statement on the evening of August 24, have called for the closure of U.S. military bases in the Philippines after the expiration of the current agreement in 1991. However, the Philippine Constitution stipulates that the ratification of a new military base agreement after the expiration of the existing agreement requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.

Mrs. Aquino said, "The United States has not yet expressed its position on the issue of signing a new base agreement."

She hopes that negotiations with the United States on whether to sign a new agreement can begin in December this year.

    科·阿基诺总统谈美在菲基地问题
    新华社马尼拉8月25日电　菲律宾总统科拉松·阿基诺25日对记者说，关于美国在菲律宾军事基地的前途问题，政府会考虑东盟其他国家的看法，但需要根据菲的民族利益作出决定。
    由23名议员组成的参院已有12名于24日晚联名要求菲在1991年期满后关闭美国军事基地。但菲宪法规定，原有基地条约过期后签订新的军事基地条约需要参院2／3票数通过。
    科·阿基诺夫人说：“美国尚未就签订新的基地条约问题表态。
    她希望今年12月同美国开始会谈是否签订新的条约问题。
