Recently, I read an article discussing reportage literature that boldly declared, “Praise is fundamentally not the function of reportage literature,” and asserted, “Our past reportage literature has been a betrayed reportage literature.”

The conclusions are bold and unusual. However, the arguments do not stand up to scrutiny. I believe there is a need for discussion.

	I
	For example, it is argued that reportage literature is a “tool for dissemination” rather than a “tool for propaganda,” and that “reportage literature is first and foremost completely true; as a tool primarily for disseminating information, its emotional color cannot be too strong.”

	Is this really the case? Reportage literature, a literary genre that lies at the intersection of news and art, possesses both the characteristics of news and art. Because of its news characteristics, it naturally has the function of disseminating information and promoting certain viewpoints or facts. Because of its artistic characteristics, it naturally possesses aesthetic value. However, as a member of the literary family, the news elements in reportage literature are not its guiding spirit. Literary elements are its guiding spirit. When the author engages in arduous contemplation on whether reportage literature is a “tool for dissemination” or a “tool for propaganda,” and concludes that reportage literature is “primarily for disseminating information,” the reportage literature they are discussing is merely news reports adorned with some literary techniques. Reportage literature has been factually expelled from the literary family. If one insists on using the sensational term “betrayal,” this indeed can be considered a betrayal of reportage literature.

	I solemnly declare: This article does not intend to deny the “dissemination function” of reportage literature. According to the theory of information, any genre is a carrier of information, and reportage literature is no exception. It is just that it is entirely different from news media, which are permeated with the “dissemination function.” This article also does not intend to deny the “propaganda function” of reportage literature.

	II
	It is also argued that “anyone with a sense of history and rationality will feel that there are very few things truly worth praising in this era.”

	Risking being seen as lacking “historical sense and rationality,” I still must point out the bias in this argument. If one truly has a sense of history and rationality, or if we place “this era” within the context of human social development and the process of human self-improvement, we arrive at the opposite conclusion: There are indeed many things truly worth praising in this era.

	It is recognized by historians that around 2000 BCE, there were five major ancient civilizations on Earth: the Egyptian civilization, the Mesopotamian civilization, the Aegean civilization, the Indus Valley civilization, and the Yellow River civilization. At that time, the first four ancient civilizations were interacting and merging into a major branch of human civilization: the maritime civilization. The latter ancient civilization developed independently, becoming another major branch of human civilization: the inland civilization. These are the origins of what we now call Western culture and Eastern culture, and the sources of contemporary civilization.

	A brief overview shows us: Eastern culture and Western culture are two different cultural mechanisms and traditions that naturally formed during the development of human society. Their relationship is complementary. In fact, after these two cultures developed into independent forms, they began continuous interaction, continuing to develop their own characteristics through this interaction. For modern humans, both cultures are indispensable. Just as the Earth's surface is composed of two major elements: oceans and land, without oceans or land, there would be no environment for human survival, and thus no humans themselves.

	Our ancestors created Eastern culture, which, after experiencing the early maturity of the slave society stage and the full, normal development of the feudal society stage, entered a period of major cultural mechanism renewal with the “May Fourth” New Culture Movement seventy years ago. It is undeniable that this major renewal began under the bombardment of Western industrial countries' cannons, under the impact of Western industrial culture accompanied by blood and fire. From a historical perspective, how it began is not particularly important. What is particularly important is that the curtain of major renewal was finally raised, and China's ancient civilization finally took a decisive step towards modern civilization. This is a step of epochal significance for the development of Chinese society. However, at that time, society's demand for the people to free themselves from oppression, exploitation, and slavery far exceeded the demand for cultural mechanism renewal. After nearly thirty years of “criticism through weapons,” the former demand was realized, and the latter demand became prominent. After nearly thirty more years of “criticism through weapons,” our country entered a historical turning point that is even deeper than the “May Fourth” New Culture Movement. On this ancient land where human civilization has independently developed for four to five thousand years, the friction between old and new systems, the collision of various ideas, the adjustment of interest relationships, and the renewal of cultural mechanisms have caused the entire economic, political, and social life to undergo drastic changes. Opportunities and risks, successes and setbacks, hopes and disappointments, clarity and confusion, the prospect of revitalization, and the difficulty of progress are all stirring and tormenting the citizens of the republic. I would like to remind writers and critics to pay attention to the fact that the force driving and leading today's drastic changes is not some other political force, but the Chinese Communist Party, which rose to prominence and took the lead in social progress during the “May Fourth” New Culture Movement.

	In just a short decade, many old ways of living, thinking, and their expressions have been transformed and discarded. Vibrant ways of living, thinking, and their expressions, new political and economic systems, new cultural mechanisms, and so on are sprouting, developing, and growing stronger.

	Criticism is necessary, but its main purpose is not to disseminate information or carry out supervision, but to clear the foundation for construction and create an environment. Construction is even more necessary. Without the construction of new political and economic systems, cultural mechanisms, and values, criticism has no standards and is similar to the “great criticism” during the Cultural Revolution. Do not emphasize “no construction without destruction” one-sidedly. The opening of a closed environment and the breaking of a rigid thinking shell are entirely dependent on the policy of reform and opening up established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. This “opening” and “breaking” are not abstract or illusory, but are embodied by living people and real events. Under the call of reform and opening up, those who dare to criticize ignorance, those who break free from rigid models, those who cry out against social ills, those who unveil historical truths, and those who judge history are all pushing the wheels of modern civilization forward. Why shouldn't their spirits and achievements be praised?

	Just as we should not limit our vision to “dissemination” versus “propaganda,” we should not limit our vision to “praise” versus “criticism.” There is no need to deprive reportage literature of the right to praise, nor is there a need to especially emphasize reportage literature's right to criticize, nor is there a need to rack one's brains over the choice between praise and criticism. Otherwise, one has not yet transcended the mundane. The current surge of contemporary Chinese reportage literature has already begun to break free from the narrow model of either praise or criticism, or either criticism or praise, and is widely accepted by the public with a new face that emphasizes reason and enlightenment.

	The spirit of reportage literature is neither criticism nor praise, but reason. The criticism we need is rational criticism, not the irrational criticism that was rampant during the Cultural Revolution; the praise we need is rational praise, not the irrational praise that was rampant during the Cultural Revolution. Reportage literature without reason is not true reportage literature. Promoting reason is the basic function or core spirit of contemporary Chinese reportage literature. Reportage literature in the new era indeed exists and develops in this way, not constrained by any outdated and therefore shallow critical framework of critics.

	III
	The spirit of reason, which is the spirit of revealing truth, propagating truth, and disseminating truth, is the core of contemporary Chinese reportage literature. General meanings of “dissemination,” “propaganda,” “praise,” “criticism,” and so on are merely its various different levels and different aspects of external manifestations.

	The Enlightenment movement aimed at the ignorance based on the economic, political, and ideological foundations of feudal society. Enlightenment is the use of reason to eliminate ignorance. This is a stage that human society must inevitably experience. Therefore, when the development of society in the birthplace of Eastern ancient civilization produced the same need, China in the early 20th century saw the “May Fourth” New Culture Movement—the Eastern Enlightenment movement. The pioneers of modern Chinese civilization raised the banner of science and democracy, and launched a fierce attack on the feudal cultural tradition centered on old ethics. China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after nearly thirty years of revolutionary war, established a socialist state entirely different in nature from the bourgeois “kingdom of reason.” History must develop according to its own laws. After China's social development history chose the Chinese working class rather than the Chinese bourgeoisie as the main political force to negate the feudal ruling class in the 1920s, the task of clearing the feudal foundation, eliminating the ignorance caused by several thousand years of feudal culture, and realizing the transformation from ancient civilization to modern civilization, also fell historically on the shoulders of the Chinese working class, especially its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party. This point was only truly recognized by more and more enlightened people and finally elevated to historical self-awareness, becoming the light of reason illuminating the world, after nearly twenty years of exploration and after the modern ignorance in the ten-year Cultural Revolution caused the state and nation to pay a painful price.

	After more than half a century of complex changes and development in economics and politics, the content of reason has become clearer. It can be roughly summarized as: science—social science represented by Marxism and modern natural science; democracy—socialist democracy; humanity—revolutionary humanitarianism; freedom—academic freedom and creative freedom based on the premise of obeying the constitution.

	Promoting reason is naturally the historical mission of contemporary Chinese writers and the theme of contemporary Chinese literature. The Enlightenment rationality sparked by reform and opening up will inspire social ideals, invigorate national spirit, improve the quality of the people, enlighten people's wisdom, and beautify people's souls. No matter how tortuous the path, the Enlightenment rationality of contemporary China will inevitably lead to the perfection of socialist civilization, including the socialist political system, economic system, legal system, cultural mechanism, and spiritual morality, and will pave the way for the thorough transformation from ancient civilization to modern civilization on this ancient land.

	New reason is the lifeblood of contemporary Chinese reportage literature and the lifeblood of contemporary Chinese literature.

    当代报告文学的灵魂
     长沱
    最近看到一篇论报告文学的文章，它直接宣布：“歌颂根本就不是报告文学的职能”；断言：“以往我们的报告文学是被背叛了的报告文学”。
    论断大胆而出奇。论据却又经不住推敲。我认为有讨论之必要。
                          一
    例如，认为报告文学是“传播工具”而不是“宣传工具”，“报告文学首先是完全真实的，做为以传播信息为主要目的，它的情感色彩不可能过于强烈。”
    真是这样吗？报告文学，一个处于新闻和艺术交界处的文学品种，兼有新闻和艺术的特性。因有新闻的特性，自然也就具有了传播信息的功能，具有了宣传某种主张、某件事实的功能。因有艺术的特性，自然也就具有了审美的价值。然而，做为文学家族中的一员，报告文学中所具有的新闻因素根本不是这种文体的主导精神。文学因素才是它的主导精神。当论者对报告文学是“传播工具”还是“宣传工具”进行着艰苦的思辨，并认定报告文学是“以传播信息为主要目的”的时候，他所说的报告文学不过是借用某些文学技巧来点缀的新闻通讯而已。报告文学已经事实上被清除出了文学家族。如果一定要使用“背叛”这个耸人听闻的字眼，这倒的确可以算做对报告文学的一种背叛。
    郑重申明：本文无意否认报告文学的“传播功能”。按照信息论的观点，任何文体无不是信息的载体，报告文学焉能例外？只不过要说明，它与浑身上下都具有“传播功能”的新闻媒介全然不同而已。本文也无意否认报告文学的“宣传功能”。
                 二
    又如，认为“稍有历史感和理性意识的人都会觉得这个时代真正值得歌颂的东西实在不多”。
    冒着会被认为缺乏“历史感和理性意识”的风险，我仍然不得不指出此论的偏颇。如果真有历史感和理性意识，或者说，我们如果把“这个时代”放到人类社会发展的历史长河中、放到人自身的发展完善过程中考察，得到的恰恰是相反的结论：这个时代真正值得歌颂的东西实在不少。
    为史学界所公认的有据可考的历史，公元前二千年前后，地球上共存着五大古文明发源地。即埃及文明、两河流域文明、爱琴海文明、印度河中上游文明和黄河中游文明。其时，前四大古文明在相互交流，融汇为人类文明的一大分支：海洋文明。后一大古文明独自发育，长成了人类文明的又一大分支：内陆文明。它们是今天之所谓西方文化、东方文化的起点，是当代文明的源头。
    简略的勾勒使我们看到：东方文化、西方文化是人类社会发展过程中自然形成的两种不同的文化机制，两种不同的文化传统。它们之间的关系是互补的关系。事实上，两种文化发育成独立的形态之后，就开始了不间断的交流，在交流中继续发展着自己的个性。对于现代人类，两种文化都是不可缺少的。如同地球表面是由海洋和陆地两大物构成的一样，没有了海洋，或没有了陆地，也就没有了人类赖以生存的环境，也就没有了人类自身。
    我们祖先创造的东方文化，在经历了早熟的奴隶社会阶段的盛衰、在经历了充分地正常发育的封建社会阶段的盛衰之后，以七十年前的“五四”新文化运动为转折点，进入了一个文化机制大更新的历史时期。毋庸讳言，这次大更新是在西方工业国家的大炮轰击下开始的，是在伴随着血与火的西方工业文化的冲击下开始的。用历史的眼光看，怎样开始并不特别的重要。特别重要的是大更新的序幕终于拉开了，中国的古代文明终于迈出向现代文明转换的有决定性意义的一步。这是对于中国社会发展具有划时代意义的一步。然而，当时的社会对人民大众摆脱被压迫、被剥削、被奴役的需求远远超过了对文化机制大更新的需求。经过了近三十年的“武器的批判”，前一个需求实现了，后一个需求突出了。又经过了近三十年的“批判的武器”的批判，我们的国家进入了其深刻性远在“五四”新文化运动之上的历史转折期。在这块人类文明自主自立地发育了四五千年的古老土地上，新旧体制的摩擦，各种观念的碰撞，利益关系的调整，文化机制的更新，使整个经济、政治和社会生活发生着急剧的变革。机遇和风险，成功和挫折，希望和失望，清醒和迷惘，振兴的前景，举步的艰难，在激荡着、折磨着共和国的公民们。我想提醒作家、评论家们注意的，是促成和领导当今急剧变革的不是别的什么政治力量，而是在“五四”新文化运动中崛起并取得社会发展进步领导地位的中国共产党。
    短短十年，许多旧的生存方式、思维方式及其表现形式被改造、扬弃。充满生机的生存方式、思维方式及其表现形式，新的政治经济体制，新的文化机制等等在萌生、在发育、在壮大。
    批判是需要的，其主要目的不在于传播什么信息，实行什么监督，而在于为建设清理地基，创造环境。建设是更需要的。没有新的政治经济体制、文化机制、价值观念的建设，批判就没有标准，同“文革”中的大批判差不多。不要片面强调“不破不立”。封闭环境的打开，僵化思维外壳的敲破，完全凭借党的十一届三中全会确立了改革开放的国策。这“打开”、这“敲破”，都不是抽象的、虚幻的，而是由活生生的人、真切切的事来体现着。在改革开放的召唤下，那些勇于向愚昧冲击的批判者、从僵化模式中脱颖而出的开拓者、针砭时弊的呐喊者、揭开历史真相的评判者，推动着现代文明的车轮向前滚动。他们的精神、他们的业绩，为什么不值得歌颂呢？
    如同不能把视野局限于“传播”还是“宣传”上一样，我们也不必把视野囿于“歌颂”还是“批判”上。无须剥夺报告文学歌颂的权利，也无须特别强调报告文学批判的权利，更无须在歌颂与批判的选择上伤脑筋。否则，仍然未曾脱俗。正在奔涌着的中国当代报告文学大潮，已经开始摆脱了非歌颂即批判或非批判即歌颂的狭隘模式，以弘扬理性、着意启蒙的全新面貌为公众普遍接受。
    报告文学的精神既不是批判也不是歌颂，而是理性。我们需要的批判是理性的批判，而不是如“文革”中所滥用的非理性的批判；我们需要的歌颂是理性的歌颂，而不是如“文革”中所泛滥的非理性的歌颂。没有理性的报告文学不是真正的报告文学。弘扬理性是中国当代报告文学的基本功能或核心精神。新时期的报告文学事实上也就是如此这般地存在着、发展着，不为任何评论家陈旧的因而也是肤浅的批评框架所规范。
                        三
    理性精神，即揭示真理、宣传真理、传播真理的精神，是当代中国报告文学的内核。一般意义的“传播”、“宣传”、“歌颂”、“批判”等等，都不过是它的种种不同层次、不同侧面的外在表现。
  启蒙运动的锋芒所向是以封建社会的经济、政治和意识形态为基础和核心的蒙昧。启蒙，即用理性来消除蒙昧。这是人类社会发展过程中必然要经历的一个阶段。正因为如此，当社会的发展在东方古代文明的发祥地产生了同样的需要时，二十世纪初期的中国出现了“五四”新文化运动——东方的启蒙运动。中国现代文明的先驱者们举起写着科学与民主的理性旗帜，向以旧礼教为核心的封建文化传统进行了猛烈的冲击。中国，在中国共产党的领导下，经过了近三十年的革命战争，建立了与资产阶级的“理性王国”性质全然不同的社会主义国家。历史总要按照着自己的规律向前发展。中国的社会发展史在20世纪20年代选择了中国工人阶级而不是中国资产阶级来作为否定封建统治阶级的主要政治力量之后，清除封建主义的地基、消除几千年封建文化造成的蒙昧、实现古代文明向现代文明的转化，也就历史地落到了中国工人阶级、尤其是它的先锋队中国共产党的肩上。这一点，是在经过了近二十年的摸索，直至现代愚昧在十年“文革”中使国家、民族付出了惨痛的代价后，才真正被越来越多的有识之士所确认并终于升华为历史的自觉，化作理性之光烛照于人世间。经过大半个世纪经济、政治的复杂变革和发展，理性的内涵比五四时期更加明确。大致可归纳为：科学——以马克思主义为代表的社会科学和现代自然科学；民主——社会主义的民主；人道——革命的人道主义；自由——以遵守宪法为前提的学术自由、创作自由。
    弘扬理性理所当然地是当代中国作家的历史使命，是当代中国文学的主题。由改革开放所激发的启蒙理性之光，将激发社会理想，振奋民族精神，提高人民素质，启迪人们的智慧，美化人们的心灵。不管会经过什么曲折，当代中国的启蒙理性必将导向包括社会主义政治体制、经济体制、法制，社会主义文化机制、精神道德在内的社会主义文明的完善，必将在中国这块古老的土地上为古代文明向现代文明的彻底转变扫清道路。
    新的理性是当代中国报告文学的生命力之所在，也是当代中国文学的生命力之所在。
