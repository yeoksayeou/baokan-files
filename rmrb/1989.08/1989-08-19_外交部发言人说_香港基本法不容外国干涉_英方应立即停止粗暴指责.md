Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 19th.

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today pointed out that recently, some British officials have rudely interfered with the drafting work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law, interfering in China's internal affairs, and this is not conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The spokesperson made these remarks in response to the recent comments made by the Hong Kong Governor's Chief Secretary, David Wilson, regarding the Basic Law.

He said, it is well-known that the drafting and formulation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is entirely within the scope of China's sovereignty and does not permit any foreign interference. In recent times, including the Hong Kong Governor's Chief Secretary, some British government officials have publicly criticized the Basic Law drafting work, rudely interfered, and even violated the provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, proposing the absurd suggestion that China should not station troops in Hong Kong.

He pointed out that the British side's actions completely violate the substance and spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, interfere in China's internal affairs, and are not conducive to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. The Chinese government hopes that the British side will, for the sake of Sino-British friendship and cooperation and the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, seriously and strictly implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and immediately stop the aforementioned erroneous actions.

    外交部发言人说
    香港基本法不容外国干涉  英方应立即停止粗暴指责
    新华社北京八月十九日电　外交部发言人今天指出，最近一些英国官员对香港特别行政区基本法起草工作的粗暴干涉，干预了中国的内政，不利于香港的繁荣与稳定。发言人是就港英政府常务司屈珩最近在香港发表的关于基本法的言谈作这番评论的。
    他说，众所周知，中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法的起草和制定，完全是中国主权范围内的事，不容任何外国进行干预。最近一段时间以来，包括港英政府常务司在内的一些英国政府官员，公然对基本法起草工作横加指责，粗暴干涉，甚至违背《中英联合声明》的规定，提出中国不要在香港驻军的荒谬主张。
    他指出，英国方面的这种做法完全违背了《中英联合声明》的实质与精神，干预了中国的内政，不利于香港的稳定与繁荣。中国政府希望英方以中英友好合作和香港的长期繁荣稳定为重，认真、严格地贯彻执行《中英联合声明》，立即停止上述错误做法。
