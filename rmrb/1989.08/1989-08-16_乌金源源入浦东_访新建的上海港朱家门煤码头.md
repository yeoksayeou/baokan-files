Twenty years ago, the eastern bank of the Huangpu River, about 14 kilometers from Wusongkou, was a vast expanse of mudflats after land reclamation. Today, a modern coal wharf with an annual handling capacity of 3.9 million tons stands here, designed, surveyed, and constructed entirely by China.

In late July, the "Changlian" ship, carrying 20,000 tons of raw coal, docked at the Zhujiamen Coal Wharf from Lianyungang. With a command from the central control room, the black gold began to flow through the suspended enclosed corridor into the coal storage facility. Some of this coal will be used for production and daily life in Shanghai, while the rest will be transshipped to the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian.

The Zhujiamen Coal Wharf project is one of the key projects in China's Seventh Five-Year Plan, with a total investment of 76.71 million yuan. The main construction includes the building of one 25,000-ton coal unloading wharf and one 1,000-ton ship loading wharf, along with production and living support facilities. Except for the electrical control equipment and hydraulic components imported from Sweden and Germany, all other equipment was produced domestically. The project, which began with the first pile driven in October 1986, was completed 158 days ahead of schedule in July 1989 and put into use.

In the central control room at the forefront of the port area, the entire wharf's loading and unloading operations are displayed on a giant liquid crystal screen covering more than 10 square meters. The control system is primarily composed of electronic computers, programmable controllers, and automatic playback machines. Port area production management has been fully automated.

This large-scale automated modern coal wharf has high environmental protection requirements. The reporter observed that advanced domestic facilities to prevent coal dust pollution are installed throughout the entire loading and unloading process. Within the port area, there is also a sewage treatment plant. Various types of sewage are strictly treated before being discharged into the Huangpu River. According to the port construction responsible person, nearly 10 million yuan was invested in pollution control. In 1987, Canadian environmental experts who came for consultation and evaluation deemed this to be an advanced level worldwide.

Walking on the wide concrete road around the port, the reporter saw rows of trees, lush green grass, orderly buildings, and the sound of ship horns. One after another, barges fully loaded with raw coal set sail from the Zhujiamen Coal Wharf. With their comings and goings, Zhujiamen will surely become more and more famous.

    乌金源源入浦东
    ——访新建的上海港朱家门煤码头
    本报记者　刘鋆
    20年前，黄浦江东岸、距吴淞口约14公里的朱家门陆域，经填土形成大片滩地。如今，一座我国自行勘测、设计、建设的年吞吐量390万吨的现代化煤码头屹立在此。
    7月底，从连云港驶来的“长连”号，作为第一艘装有2万吨原煤的巨轮稳稳泊靠在朱家门煤码头。随着中央控制室一声指令，滚滚乌金通过悬空封闭廊道徐徐注入贮煤仓……这些原煤部分供上海生产、生活使用，部分中转运往苏、浙、闽三省。
    朱家门煤码头工程是我国“七·五”计划重点建设项目之一，总投资7671万元。主体工程包括新建2.5万吨卸煤码头和1000吨级装船码头各一座，及生产、生活配套设施。整个工程除引进瑞典和德国的电气控制设备及液压部分装置外，其余设备全部是我国自行生产的。从1986年10月打下第一根码头桩，到1989年7月，工程提前158天完工并交付使用。
    在港区前沿的中央控制室里，整个码头装卸情况通过一个10多平方米的巨幅液晶屏幕展示在人们面前，以电子计算机、可编程序控制器、自动录放机为主组成整个控制系统。港区生产管理全部实现了自动化。
    这个大型自动化的现代化煤码头，环境保护要求比较高。记者看到：不仅在整个装卸生产流程中设有国内先进的防煤尘污染的设施，港区内还建有生产污水处理厂一座，各种污水经严格处理后再排入黄浦江。据港区建设负责人介绍，光用在防治污染方面的投资就接近1000万元。1987年，加拿大环保专家来访进行咨询评估时，认为这在世界上也属先进水平。
    记者走在宽阔的环港混凝土马路上，放眼四望，树木成片，绿草如茵，建筑井然有序，汽笛声声，一艘艘满载原煤的驳轮起锚驶离朱家门煤码头……随着它们的南来北往，朱家门一定会越来越出名的。
