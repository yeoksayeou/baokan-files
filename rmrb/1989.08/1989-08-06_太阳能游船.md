A small tour boat powered by solar energy (see above picture) has been successfully developed by the American company, Rovi. This 25-foot-long rectangular boat has four solar panels on its top, connected to four 100-ampere batteries. After 3 to 5 hours of sunlight, the batteries can store enough energy to last 40 hours.

The advantages of the solar-powered tour boat are that it saves energy and does not pollute the environment. This boat can accommodate 17 people.

    太阳能游船
    一艘以太阳能驱动的小型游船（见上图）已由美国的罗维公司试制成功。这艘25英尺长的长方形游船顶上装有4块太阳光电板，与4只100安培的蓄电池连结。阳光照射3至5小时即可使电池储存足敷40小时之用的能量。
    太阳能游船的优点是既节约能源，又不污染环境。这种船可乘17人。　（封）
