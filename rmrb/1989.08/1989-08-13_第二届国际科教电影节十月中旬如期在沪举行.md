The Second International Science and Education Film Festival is scheduled to be held in Shanghai mid-October as planned.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13 (Reporter Zhaolan Ying) The reporter learned from relevant sources that the Second International Science and Education Film Festival, scheduled for mid-October, will be held in Shanghai as planned.

At the preparatory center for the film festival, Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, the reporter learned that 24 countries have submitted 114 films for exhibition. They are the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East Germany, West Germany, the United States, Britain, France, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Japan, Denmark, Australia, Romania, Canada, Hungary, Italy, India, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria, and China.

The preparatory work is proceeding smoothly, and the number of countries participating in the film festival has already exceeded that of the first International Science and Education Film Festival held in 1987. The 88 films selected for this festival have also been determined.

Holding the Second International Science and Education Film Festival in Shanghai is one of the several major international cultural exchange activities held in recent years. Since October 1986, Shanghai has conducted cultural, artistic, publishing, film, and television exchanges with more than 60 countries and regions around the world. These activities are not limited to government-level exchanges; civilian exchanges are also increasing. Shanghai's local operas such as Yue opera, Shanghai opera, Peking opera, Kunqu opera, and comedic performances, as well as national dances and national music, have left their "home turf" and gone global. These exchange activities are mainly commercial performances. Not long ago, the famous Yue opera performer Yuan Xuefen led the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe to New York and San Francisco in the United States for commercial performances, lasting for more than a month.

    第二届国际科教电影节十月中旬如期在沪举行
    新华社上海8月13日电（记者赵兰英）记者从有关方面获悉：定于10月中旬举办的第二届国际科教电影节，将如期在上海举行。
    在电影节筹备中心——上海科教电影制片厂，记者了解到已有24个国家送来了114部参展影片。他们是苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、民主德国、联邦德国、美国、英国、法国、西班牙、比利时、新西兰、日本、丹麦、澳大利亚、罗马尼亚、加拿大、匈牙利、意大利、印度、摩洛哥、荷兰、波兰、奥地利和中国。
    筹备工作进行顺利，参加电影节的国家已超过了1987年举行的第一届国际科教电影节。入选本届科教电影节的88部影片也已确定。
    在上海举办第二届国际科教电影节，是近年来举办的若干大型国际文化交流活动中的一项。1986年10月以来，上海已与世界上60多个国家和地区开展文化、艺术、出版、电影、电视等方面的交流。这些活动不仅限于政府间的，民间性的也日趋增多。上海的越剧、沪剧、京剧、昆剧、滑稽等地方戏曲和民族舞蹈、民族音乐都离开“本土”，走向世界。这些交流活动又以商业性演出为主。前不久，著名越剧表演艺术家袁雪芬率上海越剧院演出团，赴美国纽约、旧金山作商业性演出，历时一个多月。
