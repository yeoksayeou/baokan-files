Liaoning, one of China's major commercial grain-producing regions, is currently facing a severe drought. According to statistics, over ten million acres of farmland in the province are threatened by the drought. Most of Liaoning experienced severe spring droughts this year, leading to delayed planting and poor seedling growth. Since late July, high temperatures and lack of rain have caused droughts in the southern, western, and central parts of the province. Currently, Liaoning Province and various cities have mobilized forces to combat the drought.
