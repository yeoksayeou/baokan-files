Recently, the "Canshui-Huangyan 1 Well" drilled in the East China Sea Shelf Basin yielded a high-production oil and gas flow. After testing, the well produced 885,000 cubic meters of natural gas and 132.5 cubic meters of condensate oil per day.

The "Canshui-Huangyan 1 Well" is located 450 kilometers southeast of Shanghai in the East China Sea Shelf Basin, with a drilling depth of 3,651 meters. This is the second well this year, after "Pinghu 4 Well," to yield industrial oil and gas flows. This result once again indicates that the East China Sea Shelf Basin has a promising future for oil and gas development.

    东海陆架又一探井获高产油气流
    据新华社上海8月2日电　日前在东海陆架盆地完钻的“残雪—黄岩1井”获高产油气流：经测试，日产天然气88.5万立方米，凝析油132.5立方米。
    “残雪—黄岩1井”位于上海东南450公里处的东海陆架盆地内，完钻井深3651米。这是今年以来继“平湖四号”之后又一口获得工业油气流的探井。这一结果再次表明，东海陆架盆地油气开发前景喜人。
