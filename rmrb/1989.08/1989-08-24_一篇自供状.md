It is said that due to the highly advanced modern science and technology, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency even possesses electronic devices such as "lie detectors" to judge the credibility of confessions from relevant personnel.

If we regard a recent article from _The New York Times_ as a "confession" from the White House regarding its attitude towards the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and input it into a "lie detector" for verification, the high degree of credibility would certainly be surprising.

Because the article is witty and concise, with minimal verbosity, it is presented to the readers as is.

_The New York Times_ states that the failure of the Contras is due to their inability to establish a base within Nicaragua, rather than being abandoned by Washington. Contra leader Adolfo Calero accused Washington of "selling out" the Contras. In response, _The New York Times_ comments, "In fact, the Contras' downfall was not due to insufficient support from Washington, but rather the lack of support from within Nicaragua." The newspaper continues, "The Contras' lack of support in Central America is not due to Secretary of State George Shultz's lack of pressure, but because Central American countries view the Contras as an unqualified force, manipulated by leaders in Miami, while the troops languish in Honduras. The Contra leaders spend more time in Washington, engaging in religious-like discussions, rather than sharing the dangers in the jungle with their troops." The article states: "Despite strong internal pressure, the United States supported the Contras for 10 years. However, the Contras now blame everyone for their failure, forgetting all of this."

_The New York Times_' final lamentation has a hint of disappointment. The Reagan administration's eight-year support for the Contras was not lacking in effort and was quite meticulous. After the Bush administration took office, although it made several adjustments to U.S. policy in Central America, it continued to support the Contras in various ways, providing various forms of "humanitarian aid." Little did they know that after more than eight years of civil war in Nicaragua, 55,000 souls had perished. The greatest humanitarian effort would be to end the war quickly for the people of Nicaragua and Central America. The agreement to disband the Contras reached by the five presidents of Central America at the Esquipulas II Summit was, for the people of Nicaragua and Central America who had suffered from the war, akin to a blessing. To the United States, the Contras it had nurtured were like a "death warrant," resulting in the Contras being in disarray, venting their grievances towards Washington, which had been scheming to support them for many years. It is no wonder that _The New York Times_ is indignant, but in its defense, because it is accustomed to being the master, it cannot shake off that arrogant demeanor. Unintentionally, it provided a good confession for Washington.

    一篇自供状
    郭伟成
    据说，由于现代科学技术的高度发达，美国中央情报局甚至拥有“测谎器”一类的电子设备，用以判断有关人员自供的可信程度。
    如果把《纽约时报》日前的一篇文章看作白宫在对待尼加拉瓜反政府武装（康特拉）态度上的一篇“自供状”，并且输入“测谎器”中进行鉴定的话，其可信程度之高，肯定会令人吃惊。
    由于这篇文章妙语连珠，极少絮烦，因此，照实转述呈于读者。
    《纽约时报》说，康特拉的失败是由于未能在国内建立起根据地，而并非由于华盛顿的抛弃。康特拉领袖阿道夫·卡莱罗曾指责华盛顿“出卖了”康特拉，对此，《纽约时报》评论说，“事实上康特拉栽跟头不是因为华盛顿支持得不够，而是缺乏来自尼加拉瓜国内的支持。”这家报纸接着说，康特拉在中美洲得不到支持，也并非贝克国务卿没有施加压力所致，而是因为中美洲国家认为康特拉是一支没有素质的部队，由头头们在迈阿密操纵，部队却在洪都拉斯混日子。康特拉领导人把更多的时间消磨在华盛顿，只进行宗教式的谈论，而不是在丛林里与部队分担危险。该文说：“美国不顾内部的强大压力，支援了康特拉10年之久。但是，康特拉现在为自己的失败而责怪所有的人，居然忘记了这一切。”
    《纽约时报》最后的感叹，颇有些恨铁不成钢的味道。里根政府8年对康特拉的支持不谓不力，而且颇费心机。布什政府上任后，虽然对美国的中美洲政策进行了若干调整，但仍然处处支持康特拉，给予种种“人道援助”。岂知尼加拉瓜内战8年多，造就了5.5万横死的阴魂。最大的人道，当是以尼加拉瓜与中美洲芸芸众生为念，尽快结束战争。中美洲5国总统在洪都拉斯特拉会议上达成遣散康特拉的协议，对于饱受战乱之苦的尼加拉瓜与中美洲人民来说，不啻是一个福音。对美国豢养的康特拉如同一道“催命符”，结果搞得康特拉方寸大乱，把一腔怨气倒向处心积虑扶持它多年的主子华盛顿，无怪乎《纽约时报》叫屈不迭，但在它的一番辩解中，因为主子当惯了，也脱不了那种盛气凌人的架势。无意中为华盛顿作了一个极好的自供。
