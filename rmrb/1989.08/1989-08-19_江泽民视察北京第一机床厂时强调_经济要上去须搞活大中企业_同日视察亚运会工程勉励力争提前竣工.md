Jiang Zemin, during his inspection of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, emphasized that the economy must be boosted by activating large and medium-sized enterprises. On the same day, he inspected the Asian Games construction project and encouraged efforts to complete it ahead of schedule.

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 19 (Reporters Xu Guangchun and Zhang Xuan Guo) — On August 18, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, inspected the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory and the Asian Games construction project. During the inspection and a discussion with workers and cadres, he made important remarks.

Yesterday, although it was early autumn in Beijing, the weather remained hot. In the morning, Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Li Xicong, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Mayor Chen Xitong, arrived at the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory in a minibus. The factory was established in June 1949 and is one of China's key machine tool manufacturing plants. Jiang Zemin visited the assembly plant, the second processing plant, the machining center production workshop, and the second heavy machinery plant, warmly greeting the workers and cadres on the production line. The workers eagerly shook hands with him and enthusiastically chatted with the General Secretary. Some office staff, technical personnel, and workers, upon hearing that the General Secretary was visiting the factory, rushed to the windows and doors, waving and clapping to welcome Jiang Zemin. Some workers said, "We have seen the General Secretary's speech in the newspaper and know that his heart is with us. His speech resonates with us, so today we proactively came out to welcome him, expressing our intentions."

At the First Machine Tool Factory, Jiang Zemin held a discussion with workers and cadres. During the workers' speeches, he sometimes interjected with questions and sometimes took notes. When the clock passed noon, Wu Yi, the deputy mayor presiding over the meeting, said that time was limited and asked if the General Secretary would like to speak. Jiang Zemin insisted on saying, "I still want to hear more from the workers." Finally, Jiang Zemin spoke. He said, "Many comrades mentioned the turmoil and rebellion. In this turmoil and rebellion, Beijing was the first to be affected. The Beijing Municipal Committee and the municipal government have taken a clear stance, a firm position, and a resolute attitude. After a considerable struggle, they led all levels of party organizations and the broad masses of the people, along with the martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers, to stop the turmoil, quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion, quickly restore order in the capital, and stabilize the national situation, making tremendous contributions. He further emphasized the need to wholeheartedly rely on the working class, especially industrial workers, to fully leverage the role of intellectuals; to strengthen the party's leadership and ideological and political work; to take concrete measures to address issues of unfair social distribution, etc. He pointed out that now, regardless of the pressures, the fundamental goal is to boost our economy and do a good job in all areas. As long as we maintain stability and unity, and our economy flourishes, there is nothing to fear. He said that currently, our economy indeed faces difficulties, but as long as the people of the entire country work together, we can definitely overcome the difficulties. The three points of individual interests serving national interests, local interests serving overall interests, and immediate interests serving long-term interests, which we often mentioned in the past, have not been discussed for many years. Now, not only do we need to discuss them, but we also need to achieve them."

Jiang Zemin particularly pointed out that to boost the economy, large and medium-sized enterprises must be well-managed and activated. Efforts should be made from two aspects to improve and activate large and medium-sized enterprises, namely, state support and enterprise potential. It can be said that there is great potential in product design, manufacturing technology, product quality, raw material and energy consumption, and capital turnover.

After the discussion, Jiang Zemin and the workers went together to the staff canteen for lunch. He queued up to buy food and sat down to eat with the workers. The workers curiously watched the General Secretary eating, and some even approached him to chat. The workers happily said, "The General Secretary eating with us workers is truly wonderful!"

In the afternoon, after leaving the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, Jiang Zemin enthusiastically inspected the Asian Games construction project, visited the workers and technical personnel there, and listened to the reports from He Zhenliang, Zhang Baifa, and other responsible officials. Jiang Zemin said on the construction site to the cadres and workers, "The Asian Games construction project is a major project in China at present. We must spare no effort to ensure the quality and timely completion of the project, striving to complete it ahead of schedule." He said, "Holding the Asian Games in China is beneficial for our reform and opening up and for developing international friendly relations. At the same time, through the holding of the Asian Games, we can boost morale and promote the construction of both material and spiritual civilization." Finally, he hoped that all parties would work together to build the Asian Games project well and hold the Asian Games successfully.

    江泽民视察北京第一机床厂时强调
    经济要上去须搞活大中企业
    同日视察亚运会工程勉励力争提前竣工
    新华社北京8月19日电　（记者徐光春、张选国）中共中央总书记江泽民18日视察北京第一机床厂和亚运会工程。在视察和与工人、干部座谈时，作了重要讲话。
    昨天，已进入初秋的北京，天气依然炎热。上午，江泽民由中共北京市委书记李锡铭、市长陈希同等陪同，乘坐面包车来到北京第一机床厂。这个厂建于1949年6月，是我国重点机床制造厂之一。江泽民先后参观了装配分厂、加工二分厂、加工中心生产车间、重型二分厂，亲切慰问在生产第一线的工人和干部。工人们争着与他握手，热情主动地与总书记攀谈。一些科室干部、技术人员和工人，听说总书记到厂里视察来了，纷纷拥向窗口、门口，向总书记招手、鼓掌，热烈欢迎江泽民同志。一些工人说，我们在报上已看到总书记讲话的内容，知道他的心是与我们相通的，他的讲话讲到我们的心里，所以，今天我们主动出来欢迎他，也表示我们的心意。
    在一机厂，江泽民与工人、干部进行了座谈。在工人发言时，他有时插话询问，有时埋头记录。当时针过了中午12点时，主持座谈会的吴仪副市长说，时间不多了，是否请总书记讲话。江泽民同志仍坚持说，我还想听听工人同志的发言。最后，江泽民同志讲了话。他说，很多同志讲到动乱和暴乱。在这场动乱和暴乱中，北京首当其冲，北京市委、市政府旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，态度坚决，经过相当艰巨的战斗，带领各级党组织和广大人民群众和戒严部队、武警部队、公安干警一起，为制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，迅速恢复首都的秩序，稳定全国局势，做出了巨大贡献。他在进一步强调要全心全意依靠工人阶级，特别是要依靠产业工人，充分发挥知识分子的作用；要切实加强党的领导、加强思想政治工作；要采取切实措施克服社会分配不公现象等问题后指出，现在，不管出现什么压力，归根结底，是要把我们的经济搞上去，把各项工作都做好。只要我们安定团结，经济蒸蒸日上，那就没有什么可怕的。他说，目前，我们的经济确实有困难，但只要全国人民同舟共济，是完全可以闯过难关的。过去我们经常讲的，个人利益服从国家利益，局部利益服从整体利益，眼前利益服从长远利益，这三点已多年不讲了，现在不仅要讲，而且要做到。
    江泽民特别指出，经济要上去，必须把大中企业搞好搞活。要从两个方面搞好搞活大中型企业，即国家支持，企业挖潜。应该说，在产品设计、制造工艺、产品质量、原材料及能源消耗、资金运转等方面都有很大的潜力可挖。
    座谈会后，江泽民同志和工人们一起走进职工食堂共进午餐。他排队买了饭菜，就和工人在一个桌上吃起来。工人们新奇地看着总书记吃饭，有的还主动凑过去与总书记交谈。工人高兴地说，总书记与我们工人一起吃份饭，真是太好了！
    下午，江泽民同志离开第一机床厂后，又兴致勃勃地视察了亚运会工程，看望了在那里施工的工人和技术人员，听取了何振梁、张百发等负责人的汇报。江泽民同志在工地上对干部、工人说，亚运会工程是我国目前的一项大工程，要全力以赴保质按时搞好工程建设，力争提前竣工。他说，在我国举行亚运会对我国改革开放，发展国际友好往来大有好处。同时，通过亚运会的召开把民心振奋起来推进我们两个文明的建设。最后，他希望各方通力协作把亚运会工程建设好，把亚运会举办好。
