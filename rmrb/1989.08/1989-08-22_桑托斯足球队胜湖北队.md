The Brazilian Santos Football Team tonight defeated the Hubei Active 28 Football Team 2-1 at the New Hua Road Stadium in Wuhan, maintaining an undefeated record in their visit to China.

The 30,000-seat New Hua Road Stadium was packed. At 7:30 PM, as the match began, the home team launched frequent attacks, coming close to scoring several times. However, under the tight defense and strong offensive pressure from the visiting team, their pace slowed down after half an hour. Star player Socrates seemed to be strolling on the field, but he seized the opportunity to pass the ball to his teammates, creating scoring chances. Each time, the home team's goalkeeper leaped to catch the ball.

The score remained 0-0 at halftime.

Twelve minutes into the second half, the home team's No. 2 Ding Wenlong headed the ball, and No. 19 Wang Xuedong kicked a powerful shot into the net. After that, the visiting team began a fierce counterattack. At the 24th and 29th minutes of the second half, the visiting team's No. 4 Elardo Mendes Silva and No. 11 Antonio Atovi each scored with powerful shots.

At the post-match press conference, the visiting team's coach Junior said, "The Hubei team forced us to fight hard. They used offside tactics, which prevented our team from speeding up."

    桑托斯足球队胜湖北队
    新华社武汉8月21日电　（记者罗辉）巴西桑托斯足球队今晚在武汉新华路体育场以2∶1战胜湖北活力28足球队，从而保持了访华比赛的不败纪录。
    三万座席的新华路体育场被挤得水泄不通。当7时30分一拉开战幕，主队就频频发起进攻，几次险些破门，但是在客队的严密防守和强大攻势下，半小时后速度慢了下来。名将苏格拉底像是在绿茵场上散步，但不失时机地传球给队友，造成射门机会，结果几次都被主队守门员鱼跃跳起将球抱在怀里。上半场双方以0∶0踢平。
    下半场开始12分钟后，主队2号丁文龙头球摆渡，19号王学东一脚劲射破网。此后，客队开始猛烈反击。在下半场进行到24分和29分时，客队4号埃拉尔多·门德斯·席尔瓦和11号安东尼奥·阿托维多分别劲射得分。
    比赛结束后的新闻发布会上，客队教练儒尼奥尔说：“湖北队能逼迫我队尽力去拚打，他们运用了造越位战术，使我队的速度快不起来。”
