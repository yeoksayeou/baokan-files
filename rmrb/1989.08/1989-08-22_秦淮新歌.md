If we compare the ten li of Qinhuai in Nanjing to a long flute, then after it has played the "brave and sorrowful" ancient melodies for a thousand years, it now "changes the tune to a new melody," playing songs of love for the socialist motherland and the decade of reform and opening up...

When you stroll along the Qinhuai River or wander in the Confucius Temple, you cannot help but be captivated by the frozen music—the exquisite architecture. These buildings were all newly constructed, reconstructed, or restored after 1984, under the guidance of the State Council's approved overall urban plan for Nanjing, in accordance with the requirements of "ancient capital characteristics and Qinhuai style." Look, the flying eaves and upturned corners of the Wen Temple, Xueyuan, and Gongyuan form the majestic Confucius Temple ancient architectural group; the elegant shadows of the former residence of the patriotic courtesan Li Xiangjun, the Meixiang Tower, the Peach Leaf Ferry where the great calligrapher Wang Xianzhi welcomed his concubine, and the winding and graceful riverside halls and rooms are all reflected in the clear waters of the dredged Qinhuai River; and there is also the magnificent Ming Dynasty city wall and the world's largest Zhonghua Gate fortress, the winding Uyi Lane, and the rainbow-like Jueqiao Bridge... All of these have infused the ancient Qinhuai, which once became a foul ditch, with youthful vitality.

In early 1986, Chairman Li Xiannian wrote an inscription during his inspection of Nanjing: "Treat the Qinhuai River, benefit the people." With the progress of the Qinhuai River treatment project, activities that are popular among the people and have a strong national and folk style have become more and more frequent: such as the Lantern Fair at the Confucius Temple during the Spring Festival, the Jinling Lantern Festival during the Lantern Festival, the Dragon Boat Racing on the Qinhuai River during the Dragon Boat Festival, the flower, bird, insect, and fish competition in early summer, and the moon-viewing on the banks of the Qinhuai River during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The autumn cultural fair has both famous performers and amateur performances, as well as calligraphy, paper-cutting, and sugar figurine performances and sales on site; the ten li of Qinhuai leisurely cruise is ongoing, with boats as painted boats, and boatmen, boat women, and service girls dressed in ancient costumes, rowing, pushing poles, and singing. Visitors can enjoy the scenery on both sides of the river and taste the boat snacks, all of which are related to the word "water," such as sugar lotus root, osmanthus lotus root powder, sugar lotus seeds, and old lotus seeds, which are very interesting.

Almost everyone can find in today's ten li of Qinhuai what they have longed for and savored. The old people who sit by the river railing day and night, the students who paint the grandeur of the Great Achievement Hall with colorful brushes, the vendors of local snacks with smiling faces, and the out-of-town tourists who gaze at the "Tianxia Wen Shun" archway for a long time, do they not all have their own "Qinhuai River" and "Confucius Temple" in their hearts? Many celebrities are no exception. After their visits, their inscriptions not only express their feelings but also mention their past connections with the Qinhuai River. This is probably what Mr. Zhu Ziqing wrote about the "historical taste of the Qinhuai River"? Economist Xue Muqiao visited the Confucius Temple and insisted on standing by the Qinhuai River. His inscription reads: "Revisiting the old place, the sea has changed. Xue Muqiao. September 18, 1931, worked here. April 3, 1989." The current female pioneer in the world of physics, Wu Jianxiong, an American citizen of Chinese descent, was deeply moved when she arrived at Qinhuai. Her inscription reads: "Ten li of Qinhuai, reminiscing about the old days. Studied at Nanjing Central University in the 1920s, revisiting today, deeply moved. Wu Jianxiong. October 12, 1988." The mayor of Eindhoven, the Netherlands, visited Nanjing and stood by the Qinhuai River, saying: "Today, I truly saw the ancient cityscape of Nanjing. There are many people here, which shows that the Chinese people love their national traditions."

    秦淮新歌
    如果把南京十里秦淮比作一支长笛，那么，在它吹奏了“慷慨有余哀”的千年古曲之后，如今“越调变新声”，吹奏出了对社会主义祖国的热爱，对十年来改革开放的钟情……
    当你在秦淮河边漫步，在夫子庙里徜徉，你不能不为那凝固的音乐——精美的建筑物所倾倒。这些建筑，都是1984年以来，在国务院批准的南京城市总体规划指导下，按照“古都特色，秦淮风貌”的要求而新建、重建和修复的。请看，那飞檐翘角的文庙、学宫、贡院等，组成了巍巍大观的夫子庙古建筑群；那爱国名妓李香君故居媚香楼、大书法家王献之迎送爱妾的桃叶渡、邻河而建逶迤多姿的河厅河房，它们的倩影就倒映在经过疏浚了的秦淮河碧波之中；还有那雄浑的明代城垣和列世界之最的中华门城堡，那曲曲折折的乌衣巷和彩虹般的朱雀桥……所有这些，都给曾沦为臭水沟的古秦淮注入了青春的活力。
    1986年初，李先念主席视察南京市时写下题词：“治理秦淮河，造福于人民。”随着秦淮河治理工程的进展，为群众所喜闻乐见的具有浓郁民族、民俗气派的活动日益多起来：什么夫子庙春节灯市，元宵节金陵灯会，端午节秦淮河龙舟竞渡，初夏花鸟虫鱼评选，中秋节秦淮河畔赏月等。那金秋文化庙会，既有名角献艺，又有票友自乐，还有篆刻、书法、剪纸、捏糖人儿的现场表演和销售；那十里秦淮逍遥游常年不断，船为画舫，着古代服装的船夫、船娘和服务小姐，摇橹、撑篙、清唱，游人既可观赏两岸风光，又可品尝船点，船点都和“水”字相关联，什么糖粥藕、桂花藕粉、糖莲子、老菱角等，十分有趣。
    几乎所有的人都可以在今日的十里秦淮，寻找到他们所向往不已、玩味不尽的东西。那朝朝暮暮依河栏而坐的老人，那挥洒彩笔描绘大成殿雄姿的学生，那笑脸迎人的风味小吃摊摊主，那久久仰视《天下文枢》牌坊的外地游客，他们各人的心中不都有着自己的“秦淮河”、“夫子庙”吗？一些名人大家也概莫能外，他们游览后的题词除了抒发感怀外，总要写明自己过去和秦淮河有过什么联系，这大概就是朱自清先生所写的“历史的秦淮河的滋味”了？经济学家薛暮桥游览夫子庙后，坚持要到秦淮河边站一站，他的题词是：“旧地重游，沧海桑田。薛暮桥。一九三一年九一八在此工作。一九八九年四月三日。”当今世界物理学界女杰、美籍华人吴健雄，身临秦淮，激动不已，她的题词是：“十里秦淮怀古旧。二十年代就学于南京中大，今日重游，不胜感慨。吴健雄。一九八八年十月十二日。”荷兰埃因候温市市长来南京访问，他站在秦淮河畔说：“今天，我才真正看到了南京的古城风貌。这里的人很多，说明中国人民是热爱自己民族传统的。”
    啊，有多少人，在自己的心中谱写着“秦淮新歌”！　李大容
