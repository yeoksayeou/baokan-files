The Shaolin Temple Martial Arts Hall in Songshan Mountain

"All under heaven's martial arts come from Shaolin." The modernized Shaolin Temple Martial Arts Hall has risen to meet the international "Shaolin fever." This hall is grand in scale, featuring a performance hall, training rooms, and arenas. It employs Shaolin monks and martial arts masters to teach Shaolin boxing, and it holds international martial arts competitions periodically. Currently, hundreds of martial arts enthusiasts from countries such as Japan, the United States, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland have received training here.

The Song Dynasty Capital Street in Kaifeng

Kaifeng's Song Dynasty Capital Street is designed and constructed based on the descriptions in "Dongjing Meng Hua Lu" and the illustrations in "Qingming Shang He Tu." Along the 400-meter-long street, there are rows of imitation Song Dynasty buildings, shops, and pavilions, each meticulously crafted and grand, gleaming with gold and jade. The street is lined with dozens of shops, their signs and banners shining brightly, and their plaques gleaming with gold. Walking through, one is dazzled by the sights and feels the ancient atmosphere.

The Ancient Tomb Museum in Luoyang

On the northern slope of Mengshan Hill in the ancient capital of Luoyang, there are so many ancient tombs that there is "no space for a cow to lie down." In 1987, the largest ancient tomb museum in the country was built here. The museum displays 22 relocated and restored ancient tombs dating from the Han Dynasty to the Northern Song Dynasty. These are the finest examples from the thousands of ancient tombs excavated in the Luoyang region over the years, making it a center for the study and excavation of ancient Chinese tombs.

The Yin Ruins Museum in Anyang

Anyang's Yin Ruins are famous for the discovery of the oldest Chinese script, oracle bone inscriptions. The Yin Ruins Museum is built on the ruins of the Yin Dynasty, with reconstructed or restored Yin Dynasty buildings. The architecture is simple and elegant, partially restoring the grandeur of the "first ancient capital of China." Here, a large number of Yin and Shang Dynasty relics are displayed, which are of great importance for studying and investigating the culture, art, and social conditions of China during the Yin and Shang periods.

    张毅兵文　李明图
    嵩山少林寺武术馆　“天下功夫出少林”。现代化的少林寺武术馆，应国际“少林热”拔地而起。该馆规模恢弘，设有演武厅、练功房、擂台等，聘请少林武僧和武术高手传授少林拳术，并不定期举办国际武术比赛。目前，已有日、美、德、意、瑞士等国家的武术爱好者数百人在此接受了培训。
    开封宋都一条街　开封的宋都一条街是根据《东京梦华录》的记述和《清明上河图》的描绘设计建造的。400余米的长街两旁，一式的仿宋楼阁馆店，鳞次栉比，精巧宏丽，金碧辉煌。长街上数十店铺，旗招幌耀，牌匾金灿，漫步其间，令人目不暇接，顿觉古风扑面。
    洛阳古墓博物馆　九朝古都洛阳北侧的邙山岭上，古墓葬多得“无卧牛之地”。1987年，这里建起一座目前全国最大的古墓博物馆。馆内陈列着上自两汉、下至北宋的22座搬迁复原的古墓，是多年来洛阳地区考古发掘上千座古墓中的精品，成为中国古墓研究和发掘信息中心。
    安阳殷墟博物苑　安阳的殷墟曾以发现中国最古老的文字甲骨文而举世瞩目。殷墟博物苑是在殷墟遗址上仿建或复原的殷代建筑，风格古朴典雅，部分再现了“中华第一古都”的壮观景象。这里陈列大批殷商文物，对研究和考察殷商时期我国的文化艺术、社会状况有重要价值。（附图片）
