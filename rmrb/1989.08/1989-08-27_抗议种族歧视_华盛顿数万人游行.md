Tens of thousands of Americans from across the country gathered in Washington today for a "funeral procession" to protest a series of Supreme Court rulings this year that weakened the rights of African Americans.

Under the dull beat of drums, the marchers, dressed in black and white, walked silently through the main streets of Washington. At the front of the procession, several young people carried a coffin, with a sign in front reading "Bury Racism" and "No Backsliding on Human Rights."

Black politician Jesse Jackson, the chairman of the largest labor union in the United States, the AFL-CIO, Kirkland, and many prominent human rights movement leaders participated in today's march. This march, initiated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), received support from more than 50 organizations nationwide.

In the 1960s and 1970s, under the impetus of the civil rights movement, the U.S. government and private institutions had taken some measures aimed at improving the status of African Americans, such as providing certain proportions of employment and admissions preferences and granting African Americans the right to sue employers. However, many authoritative investigations have shown that these improvement measures are insignificant. Due to racial prejudice and the reduction of government welfare spending, there remains a huge gap between African Americans and whites. The recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, dominated by conservatives, that the Richmond city ordinance providing appropriate consideration for black businesses is invalid, threatens some of the rights that African Americans have already fought for.

The marchers finally gathered on the squares on both sides of the Capitol to hold a large-scale rally, strongly urging Congress to legislate to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling.

### 抗议种族歧视  华盛顿数万人游行

    抗议种族歧视
    华盛顿数万人游行
    新华社华盛顿8月26日电  （记者黄泳）来自全国各地的数万名美国人今天在这里举行了“送葬游行”，抗议美国最高法院今年作出的一系列削弱黑人权益的裁决。
    在沉闷的鼓声中，身着黑色和白色服装的游行者一言不发地行走在华盛顿的主要街道，在队伍前列的几位青年抬着一具棺材，前面的标语牌上写着“埋葬种族主义”，“不许在人权问题上开倒车”。
    黑人政治家杰克逊、美国最大的工会组织“劳联—产联”主席柯克兰和许多知名的人权运动领袖参加了今天的游行。这次由美国全国有色人种进步协会倡议的游行得到了全国50多个组织的响应。
    在60、70年代人权运动的促进下，美国政府、私营机构曾采取了一些旨在改善黑人地位的措施，如在雇工、招生方面给予一定比例的照顾和赋予黑人起诉雇主的权利等，然而许多权威调查证明，这些改善措施是微不足道的。由于种族偏见和政府福利开支的压缩等原因，美国黑人和白人之间仍然存在着巨大的鸿沟。由保守派人士占多数的美国最高法院最近裁决里士满市予以黑人企业适当照顾的法令无效，将威胁到黑人已争取到的某些利益。
    游行者最后聚集在国会两侧广场举行了声势浩大的集会，强烈呼吁国会以立法形式否决最高法院的裁决。
