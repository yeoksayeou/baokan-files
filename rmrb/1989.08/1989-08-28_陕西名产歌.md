    陕西名产歌
    冶铁
    三秦大地物富饶，
    名特产品知多少？
    关中遍地产秦椒，
    大宗出口欧美澳。
    彬州甜梨陕北枣，
    秦岭果王猕猴桃。
    金丝猴、大熊猫，
    举世珍奇朱鹮鸟。
    洛南名产是核桃，
    凤县花椒大红袍。
    宁强天麻耀州瓷，
    临潼石榴赛玛瑙。
    桂花稠酒腊羊肉，
    饺宴品种真不少。
    礼泉洛川苹果好，
    洋县黑米餐中宝。
    城固柑桔声誉高，
    榆林地毯四海销。
    靖边柳编真精巧，
    洋人看了掏腰包。
    汉中特产有棕箱，
    不怕虫蛀老鼠咬。
    平利国漆美名扬，
    潼关酱菜销路广。
    更有西凤名牌酒，
    一滴沾唇满口香。
    秦川牛，佳米驴，
    体形高大力气强。
    渭北发展奶山羊，
    大荔西瓜红沙瓤。
    陕西自古帝王乡，
    文物古迹世无双。
    中外游客请观光，
    风味小吃任品尝。
