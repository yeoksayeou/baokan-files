A delegation from Xinjiang to the disaster-stricken Alataw region has set "five rules" to share the hardships with the local people, winning the warm welcome of cadres and the masses.

On July 17, heavy rain and hailstorms hit northern Xinjiang's Alataw region, triggering flash floods that caused significant damage to state and public property. The Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Government expressed deep concern for the disaster-stricken people, immediately dispatching a delegation consisting of 13 bureau-level officials to the disaster area. Before departing, the delegation set five rules: no accepting banquets or gifts; no special treatment, with each person having one dish and one soup per meal; no riding in small cars, with everyone taking large vehicles; no holding dance parties, with evening work instead; and participating in one day of voluntary disaster relief work.

Upon arriving in the disaster area, the delegation leader immediately made these "five rules" public, welcoming monitoring from cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups. Local officials, fearing that the delegation might not eat well, suggested adding four small dishes of cold cuts to the one dish and one soup. The delegation did not agree.

    “约法五章”赴灾区
    新疆一慰问团受欢迎
    新华社乌鲁木齐8月2日电　（通讯员张家印）新疆维吾尔自治区赴阿勒泰灾区慰问团“约法五章”，与灾区群众同甘共苦，深受干部、群众欢迎。
    7月17日，新疆北部阿勒泰地区突降暴雨、冰雹，引起山洪暴发，给国家和人民财产造成重大损失。自治区党委和自治区人民政府对灾区群众十分关怀，立即派出由13个厅局负责同志参加的慰问团，奔赴灾区。临行前，慰问团约法五章：一不吃请，不收礼品；二不搞特殊，每人每餐一菜一汤；三不坐小车，一律乘大车；四不搞舞会，晚上加班工作；五参加一天救灾义务劳动。
    慰问团来到灾区后，团长立即将这个“约法五章”公布于众，欢迎各族干部、群众监督。地区同志怕慰问团吃不好，提出一菜一汤之外，再加四小盘凉菜，慰问团没有同意。
