Title: A Suggestion

Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have decided to address seven issues of concern to the people in the near future: rectifying corruption, promoting hard work, and regaining the trust of the people. Many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also formulated various anti-corruption measures in accordance with their own situations, which have been widely supported by the people. However, some people are concerned: while the "scriptures" from above are good, it remains to be seen whether the "monks" below will recite them, and if so, how well they will recite them. I believe this concern is not without reason. Over the past few years, the Central Committee has issued numerous documents on these issues, some of which have been repeatedly emphasized, but in some places, these directives have not been effectively implemented, and in some cases, there have even been countermeasures to central policies. Haven't we seen numerous new variations of the "four dishes and one soup" problem?

Some people say that in the past, the scriptures were either not recited or misinterpreted, and the problem lies with the leadership above, which weakened party leadership and relaxed party supervision, creating a breeding ground for corruption. Now, things are different; the leadership is tightening up, and an atmosphere of anti-corruption and integrity is being formed, making things easier to handle. This is certainly reasonable. However, "atmosphere" is only an external condition. A good atmosphere does not guarantee that things will be done well.

To ensure that the Central Committee's spirit is translated into voluntary actions by various localities, in addition to the strict enforcement of discipline by various levels of inspection agencies, I believe that the propaganda and media departments should take on the responsibility of supervision. For example, on this issue, news organizations can conduct both positive and negative reporting. On the one hand, they should commend and publicize the model actions of regions and departments that are leading the way in implementing the Central Committee's spirit, including their leaders, and introduce their successful experiences to promote a spirit of clean governance and hard work. On the other hand, they should expose and criticize those leading organs and leaders who treat the Central Committee's spirit as a joke, or even refuse to implement it, or pay lip service while doing the opposite, or engage in deception, to increase the openness and transparency of anti-corruption reporting. Only in this way can the Central Committee's spirit be effectively implemented.

    一个建议
    赵振宇
    最近，党中央、国务院决定在近期内做七件人民群众关心的事，整治腐败，艰苦奋斗，取信于民。不少省、市、自治区也结合自己的情况制定了若干廉政措施，受到人民群众的拥护。但是，也有人担心：上边的“经”是蛮好的，就不知下面的“和尚”念不念，或念得好不好。此种担心我看不是没有理由。几年来中央就这些问题发过不少文件，有的甚至是三令五申，但有的地方就是贯彻不力，甚至“上有政策，下有对策”。就是“四菜一汤”不是也翻出许多新花样来么？
    有人说，前几年有经不念，好经歪念，问题出在上头，上头淡化党的领导，松懈党的监督，造成了腐败现象容易滋生的温床；现在不同了，上头抓紧了，形成了反腐倡廉的气候，事情就好办了。这当然也有道理。不过，“气候”毕竟只是一种外部条件，气候好，并不等于一定能把事情办好。
    为了保证把中央的精神变成各地的自觉行动，除了各级检查机关严格执行纪律外，我认为，宣传舆论部门应该很好地担负起监督责任来。比如就这个问题，新闻单位可以搞些正面和反面的报道。一方面要对那些带头贯彻中央精神的地区和部门包括领导者予以表彰，宣传他们的模范行动，介绍他们的成功经验，使廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗精神蔚然成风；另一方面也要对那些把中央精神当儿戏，甚至拒不执行中央精神，或阳奉阴违，或弄虚作假的领导机关和领导者予以揭露、批评，以增加廉政建设报道的公开性和透明度，这样，才能保证中央的精神得到落实。
