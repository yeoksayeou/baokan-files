The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" national key scientific and technological research project on cotton new variety selection has achieved gratifying results.

Led by the Cotton Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, this project involved 38 units and, after several years of effort, has successfully developed 31 excellent varieties (lines). Most of these are high-quality, multi-resistant new varieties. On the basis of high yield, their fiber quality and resistance to wilt and yellow wilt disease have been significantly improved. Additionally, there is a batch of new types of cotton, such as long-staple cotton, low-phenol cotton, short-season cotton, drought-resistant cotton, and insect-resistant cotton, which meet the different needs of the textile industry and cotton production. In 1988, 17 new varieties were promoted and planted over 22 million mu, exceeding the plan by more than one fold. Among them, the high-yielding, disease-resistant, and good-quality "Zhongmian 12" covered 10.19 million mu. This is another excellent variety following "Lu 1" and "Zhongmian 10." Low-phenol cotton has developed to 780,000 mu, ranking first in the world.

    农业科技人员联合攻关
    一批棉花良种育成推广
    本报讯  “七五”国家重点科技攻关项目——棉花新品种选育获可喜成果。
    由中国农科院棉花研究所主持、有38个单位参加的这个科技攻关项目，历经数年努力，现已育成31个优良品种（系），其中多是优质、多抗新品种。在高产基础上，它们的纤维品质和抗枯、黄萎病性有了明显提高。还有一批适应纺织部门和棉花生产不同需要的长绒棉、低酚棉、短季棉、耐旱棉及抗虫棉等新类型。17个新品种在1988年推广种植2200万亩，完成计划一倍以上，其中高产、抗病、品质良好的“中棉12”达1019万亩。这是我国继“鲁棉1号”、“中棉10号”的又一良种。低酚棉已发展到78万亩，居世界第一。（汪若海）
