In the blink of an eye, it has been 24 years since our outstanding military commander and one of the main founders of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, Comrade Liu Yalou, left us. Over the past 20 years, I have often thought of this close friend who dedicated his life to the Party and the people, leaving behind an everlasting legacy. I remember the time we spent together in Dalian 40 years ago. Whenever I read articles about Yalou in books and newspapers, I am reminded of our close interactions.

I first heard the name "Liu Yalou" in 1938 in Di Hua, now known as Urumqi. At that time, I was working at the Central Representative Office in Xinjiang (headed by Deng Fa), primarily responsible for using my public identity (Deputy Colonel of the Xinjiang Supervisory Office) to transport medicines, clothing, and other supplies to Yan'an. I also escorted Party cadres through Xinjiang and Gansu back to Yan'an or through Gansu and Xinjiang to the Soviet Union. In 1938, Yalou passed through Xinjiang on his way to the Soviet Union for study, and it was the "Xinjiang Office" that was responsible for his escort. I did not see him in Urumqi. I learned about him from some Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army comrades who had passed through the "Office." They told me that a Red Army cadre from Yan'an had come through, known for his bravery in battle, named "Liu Yalou." I was puzzled, how could his name be "Liu Yalou"? Upon further inquiry, I found out that Yalou was from Fujian, and the Northeast comrades could not pronounce the southern accent correctly, so they heard "Liu Yalou" as "Liu Wanniu." From then on, the name "Liu Wanniu" was deeply imprinted in my memory.

At the end of 1945, I met Yalou in Dalian. At that time, I was in charge of the work of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Yalou came to Dalian with the Soviet Red Army and worked in the political department of the Soviet military on civilian affairs, actually serving as a liaison officer between the Soviet side and our side. Once, while I was working at the Soviet military command, a Soviet leader told me that there was a comrade of ours named "Wang Song," "Major Wang," and asked if I knew him, and introduced "Major Wang" to me in person. "Major Wang" at that time looked to be in his early 30s. He was of medium height, wearing a Soviet military uniform, and his dark face with bright, piercing eyes was particularly striking. During our conversation, I learned that this "Major Wang" was the same Liu Yalou I had heard about from the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army comrades in Xinjiang. After we got to know each other, Yalou said he also knew me, and humorously added, "Although we hadn't met before, we were old acquaintances." He asked me about the situation of those Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army comrades he had met in Urumqi. When he learned that some comrades had sacrificed their lives on the battlefield or had been taken by illness, his regret was evident. My initial impression of Yalou was his frankness, straightforwardness, and concern for his comrades, which left a deep impression on me.

From the end of 1945 to May-June 1946, I worked with Yalou in Dalian for only about half a year. We mutually understood and supported each other, and our cooperation in work was very good. Yalou was a year older than me, and I always treated him as an elder brother. We were unconstrained and talked freely about everything, but he never mentioned his past experiences in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. It was only in recent years, through the reminiscences of some comrades, that I learned about his military achievements in the Red Army.

Yalou joined the Red Army in 1929 in his hometown of Wuping, Fujian, and participated in guerrilla warfare with the troops. His unit had once established the famous Longting and Shanghang revolutionary base areas. Chairman Mao's poem, "Red flags fly over Tingjiang, straight to Longyan and Shanghang; restoring the country, dividing land and property, busy as can be," praises the scene of seizing landlords, distributing land, and achieving great victories there. Yalou was brave and clever in battle and quickly grew into an outstanding Red Army commander. He participated in many famous battles such as the capture of Loushan Pass, the crossing of the Chishui River, the surprise attack on the Lazi Pass, and the march to Zhiluo Town, achieving many remarkable feats. In early 1931, our comrades in Harbin who were engaged in underground work learned from the newspapers that the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Chairman Mao, had defeated the Nationalist Army's encirclement campaign of ten thousand troops and captured the enemy's frontline commander Zhang Huiceng. The news stirred up great enthusiasm, and everyone spread the word, greatly inspiring the revolutionary struggle. However, I did not know at the time that in this battle, the unit that achieved the feat of capturing Zhang Huiceng, the 35th Red Army Division, had Yalou as its political commissar. Yalou never boasted about his past glorious deeds, and his humble and cautious character embodied the high moral qualities of a communist.

Yalou was straightforward and warm-hearted towards his comrades, making it easy for people to approach him, and many people were willing to interact with him. Our municipal committee comrades all welcomed him, and in that special environment, he gave us a lot of help. Yalou was meticulous in his work, worked silently and effectively, and was very successful. At that time, both we and the Soviet military had only been in Dalian for about half a year. Although our overall goals were the same, due to different national conditions, different understandings of things, and different working methods, there were often misunderstandings and disagreements in our cooperation. Under the premise of the Soviet military's military control over Dalian, whether we could handle the relationship with the Soviet authorities well directly affected whether we could establish a foothold in this region. Yalou, who was working in the Soviet military, was more familiar with the Soviet side's situation; at the same time, he also understood our Party's policies and the work situation in Dalian, so he could easily play a role in communicating between the two sides.

After October 1945, the Dalian Municipal Committee and the municipal government were successively established, and the Luda region became a liberated area controlled by the Soviet military and led by our Party. However, how to organize and mobilize the peasants in Dalian, a Soviet military-controlled area, to carry out land reform was a new task facing the municipal committee. Our cadres, mostly from various liberated areas, were accustomed to the land reform methods used in the liberated areas, such as holding struggle meetings, allowing peasant masses to expose the crimes of landlords and tyrants, forcing them to kneel, wear high hats, and parade through the streets, and carrying out large-scale propaganda. The Soviet side, however, did not approve of these methods. They repeatedly proposed to the municipal committee that our grassroots comrades did not follow policies and did not consider the impact, demanding that we stop these actions. Sometimes, when we did not stop, their troops would intervene militarily and disperse the struggle meetings. The masses and our grassroots cadres did not understand this, thinking that the Soviet side did not support us in carrying out land reform. Therefore, there were often misunderstandings between the two sides. In addition to explaining the situation to the Soviet side and making representations, I also asked Yalou to use his identity to help us explain and communicate with the Soviet side. He explained to the Soviet side that land reform was being carried out according to the decision of the Central Committee of our Party; and explained that Chinese comrades were friendly to the Soviet Union and could be trusted. At the same time, Yalou also told us the opinions of the Soviet side. He believed that the Soviet side supported us in carrying out land reform, that holding meetings to struggle against landlords to eliminate feudal exploitation should be done, but only asked us to adopt methods that both sides could accept. The Soviet side was mainly concerned that the Americans and the Kuomintang would seize the opportunity to attack the Soviet Union, thus putting the Soviet Union in a passive position in diplomacy. Yalou also told me that as long as we held the struggle meetings indoors and did not let American and Kuomintang spies take photos and publish them in newspapers, the Soviet side would not interfere again. After that, the municipal committee repeatedly studied the situation with grassroots comrades, explained the situation, and improved the struggle methods. In this way, we reached a good understanding with the Soviet military authorities on the issue of land reform. On this basis, the land reform in the Dalian region was able to proceed smoothly.

During his time in Dalian, the Luda Party organization was mobilizing all forces to support the frontline of the War of Liberation, which was the overriding task at the time. The Luda Regional Committee fully utilized the advantages of Dalian as an industrial city, accelerated the restoration of production, and supported the frontline in many aspects such as manpower, materials, and technical forces. The East China, North China, and Northeast liberated areas also sent cadres to Dalian to purchase various materials. The Luda Regional Committee (Municipal Committee) followed the instructions of the Northeast Bureau and did its best to provide all convenient conditions for the liberated areas to purchase materials and opened the green light. At the end of 1945, the Soviet Union, according to the treaty signed with the Kuomintang government, handed over the three major cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin to the Kuomintang. After that, our land transportation for transporting materials was blocked. All frontline support materials had to be transported through the sea route controlled by the Soviet military. The Soviet side was generally aware of our situation in transporting materials and repeatedly expressed to the regional committee that they believed we were taking everything away, which was not conducive to the restoration of local production in Dalian and would bankrupt Dalian. Our comrades did not understand the Soviet side's intentions and were always unsure whether the Soviet side would hand over Dalian to the Kuomintang like Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. Many comrades believed that it was better to take more things for the liberated areas than to wait for the Soviet Union to hand over Dalian. The regional committee specially explained and negotiated with the Soviet military command on the issue of transporting materials, explaining that we were firmly implementing the economic policy of restoring production, and that although the liberated areas took away some things when purchasing materials, they also brought a large amount of funds, which would not bankrupt Dalian, let alone the fact that coal and grain were guaranteed here, and restoring production was not a problem. At the same time, Yalou also helped us explain and communicate, explaining to the Soviet side that the CPC Luda Regional (Municipal) Committee was treating this place as a rear base to support the frontline and had no intention of taking everything away. Yalou also told us about the situation he knew, especially about the issue of whether the Luda government would be handed over. He believed that the Soviet Union would not easily hand over the local government to the Kuomintang. He believed that from the perspective of Soviet interests, the Soviet side believed that it would be more beneficial for them to have Luda in our hands. This view was consistent with the views of our regional committee comrades. We conducted extensive propaganda and education among cadres and the masses, clarified the political situation, dispelled doubts, and better played the role of the Luda rear base, providing strong support for the East China and other liberation war battlefields.

During his time in Dalian, Yalou was very diligent, often working day and night. He was experienced and good at thinking, and although he was in the Soviet military, he was always concerned about the situation of the liberation war at home and eagerly hoped to join the liberation war of the motherland and contribute to the Party and the people. He asked me to help him contact the Central Committee. I reported his situation and request to the Northeast Bureau, and soon the Northeast Bureau replied in agreement. Later, Comrade Luo Ronghuan came to Dalian for treatment, and I took Yalou to Marshal Luo's residence. Yalou personally requested to return to work in our army. Marshal Luo considered that the Northeast battlefield needed talents at that time, and Yalou had both domestic revolutionary war experience and Soviet national defense war experience, making him a rare general. It was very appropriate for him to return to work in our army. With Marshal Luo's recommendation, Yalou returned to our army soon after, and the Central Committee appointed him as the Chief of Staff of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. From then on, he threw himself into the fiery liberation war.

Although I only spent a short half year with Yalou in Dalian, we established a deep revolutionary friendship.

On May 7, 1965, Yalou unfortunately passed away due to illness at the age of only 55. I feel deeply saddened and grieved for the loss of this old friend who I had known for many years. Yalou has left us, but his contributions to the people's cause will forever be remembered.

I dedicate this article to the grave of Comrade Yalou to express the deep remembrance of an old friend.

    功勋昭世忆亚楼
    韩光
    弹指间，我军优秀的指挥员、人民空军的主要创建者之一刘亚楼同志离开我们已经24个春秋了。20多年来，我时时念起这位为党和人民的事业呕心沥血、功勋昭世的挚友，念起我们40年前在大连共事相处的岁月。这些年，每当我从书报上读到回忆亚楼的文章时，就联想起我们亲密相处的往事。
    我最早听说“刘亚楼”这个名字是在1938年的迪化，即现在的乌鲁木齐市。那时我在中央驻新疆代表（邓发）办事处工作，主要任务是利用我的公开身份（新疆督办公署上校副官），带几部汽车为延安送药品、皮衣等物资，同时接送我党干部经新疆、甘肃回延安或经甘肃、新疆去苏联。1938年亚楼路经新疆去苏联学习，也是由“驻新疆办事处”负责接送的。在乌鲁木齐我没有见到他。他的一些情况我还是从过往“办事处”的东北抗联同志那里了解到的。那几个抗联同志对我说，“办事处”来过一个延安的红军干部，听说很能打仗，名字叫“六万六”。我听了很纳闷，怎么叫“六万六”呢？再细打听，原来亚楼是福建人，东北同志听不准南方口音，就把“刘亚楼”听成了“六万六”。从那时起，“六万六”这个名字就深深地印在我脑海里了。
    1945年底，我在大连见到亚楼。当时，我主持中共大连市委工作，亚楼随苏联红军来到大连，在苏军政治部门做民政工作，实际是苏方同我方联系的一名联络官。一次我在苏军指挥部联系工作，苏军一位领导人对我说，他那里有我们的一位同志叫“王松”，“王少校”，问我认不认识，并当面把“王少校”向我做了介绍。“王少校”当时看上去也就是30多岁。中等个头，穿一身苏军军服，黝黑的脸上那双炯炯有神的眼睛格外引人注目。交谈中，我得知这个“王少校”就是我在新疆听东北抗联同志说过的刘亚楼。我们相识后，亚楼说他也知道我，同时他还风趣地说：“咱们过去虽未见过面，但却是老相知了”。他向我问起了他在乌鲁木齐接触过的那几个东北抗联同志的情况。当他得知有些同志已经牺牲在战场，或被病魔夺去生命的时候，惋惜之情溢于言表。初识亚楼，他的豪爽、坦直和关心同志的品质，给我留下了很深的印象。
    从1945年底到1946年五六月，我和亚楼在大连共事只有半年多的时间。我们彼此相互了解、相互支持，工作中合作得很好。亚楼长我一岁，我总是把他当做兄长看待，彼此间无拘无束，海阔天空无话不谈，可是有关他过去在中国工农红军的战斗经历，却从未向我提起过。他在红军中的战功，我还是在近几年一些同志的回忆文章中了解到的。
    亚楼1929年在家乡福建武平参加了红军队伍，跟随部队开展游击战争。他所在部队曾开辟过闻名一时的长汀、上杭革命根据地。毛主席所写的：“红旗越过汀江，直下龙岩上杭；收拾金瓯一片，分田分地真忙”这首词，就是赞誉那里打土豪、分田地、轰轰烈烈的胜利场景的。亚楼在战斗中勇敢机智，很快就成长为一名优秀的红军指挥员，参加了攻破娄山关、抢渡赤水河、突袭天险腊子口、挥师直罗镇等许多著名战斗，屡建奇功。1931年初，我们在哈尔滨从事地下工作的同志，从报上得知工农红军在朱总司令和毛主席领导下，一举击溃了十万国民党军队的围剿，活捉了敌军前敌总指挥张辉瓒。一时群情振奋，奔走相告，革命斗争热情受到巨大鼓舞。可当时我却不知道，在这次战斗中立下活捉张辉瓒头功的部队红三十五团，它的政治委员正是刘亚楼同志。亚楼对自己过去的光荣经历没有吹嘘过，在他身上体现了共产党人谦虚谨慎的高尚品德。
    亚楼为人直爽，对同志热情，很容易让人接近，很多人都愿意和他交往。我们市委的同志都很欢迎他，在当时的特殊环境中他给了我们不少帮助。亚楼办事认真细致，工作默默无闻，却卓有成效。当时，我们和苏军到大连都只有半年多时间。彼此的工作总目标虽是一致的，但国情不同，对事物的认识不同，工作方式方法不同，在共事过程中，往往存在一些误解、分歧。在苏军对大连实行军管这个前提下，能否处理好与苏军当局的关系，直接关系到我们在这个地区能否站稳脚跟。亚楼当时在苏军里工作，比较熟悉苏方情况；同时也了解我党的方针、政策和大连地方工作情况，因而就很容易在双方起沟通的作用。
    1945年10月后，大连市委和市政府相继成立，旅大地区即成为由苏军控制、我党领导的解放区。但如何在大连这个苏军军管地区组织和发动农民进行土地改革，是摆在市委面前的一个新课题。我们的干部大都来自各解放区，习惯于以往在解放区的土改作法来发动群众，如采取开斗争大会，放手让农民群众清算地主、恶霸的罪行，罚跪、戴高帽，游街示众等方式，大张旗鼓地进行宣传。苏方对我们的这些做法却不以为然。他们多次向市委提出，说我们基层的同志不讲政策，不顾影响，要求我们制止。有时未能制止，其驻军就出面武装干涉，驱散群众斗争大会。对此，群众和我们的基层干部很不理解，认为苏方不支持我们搞土改。因而双方不时发生误会。我除向苏方说明情况，提出交涉外，也请亚楼利用他的身份，向苏方帮助我们做解释和沟通工作。他向苏方说明土改是根据我党中央决定进行的；并说明中国同志对苏是友好的，完全可以信赖。与此同时，亚楼也向我们谈了苏方的意见，他认为苏方是支持我们搞土改的，开会斗争地主消灭封建剥削也应该做，只是要求我们采用双方都能接受的方式进行。苏方主要是顾忌美、蒋抓住把柄攻击苏联，从而给苏联在外交上造成被动。亚楼还对我说，只要我们把斗争大会关在屋子里开，不让美、蒋特务拍照登报，苏方是不会再干涉的。此后，市委同基层同志反复研究形势，说明情况，改进了斗争方式，就这样，我们与苏军当局在土改问题上取得了很好谅解。大连地区的土改，在此基础上得以顺利进行下去。
    亚楼在大连期间，旅大党组织正在调动一切力量支援解放战争前线，这是当时压倒一切的中心任务。旅大地委充分利用了大连这个工业城市的优势，加紧恢复生产，从兵员、物资、技术力量等多方面支援前线。我华东、华北及东北各解放区也纷纷派干部来大连采办各种物资。旅大地委（市委）遵照东北局的指示，竭力为解放区采办物资提供一切便利条件、开绿灯。1945年末，苏联根据同国民党政府签订的条约，把沈阳、长春、哈尔滨三大城市交给了国民党。之后，我们运送物资的陆地交通被阻塞。一切支前物资的运出都得经过苏军控制的海道。苏方对我们运送物资的情况一般是清楚的，多次向地委表示，认为我们把东西都拿走不利于大连本地生产的恢复，会把大连拿垮。我们的同志对苏方意图也不摸底，始终对苏方是否会把大连像沈阳、长春、哈尔滨那样交给国民党也无把握。不少同志认为，与其坐等苏联把大连交出去，不如让我们解放区多拿一些东西为好。地委就运物资问题专门向苏军指挥部进行解释和交涉，说明我们是坚决执行恢复生产的经济政策的，各解放区来采办物资，虽拿走了一些东西，但同时也带来了大量资金，不会把大连拿垮，更何况这里煤炭、粮食有保障，恢复生产没有问题。与此同时，亚楼也帮助我们做解释、疏通工作，向苏方说明中共旅大地（市）委是要把这里做为后方基地来支援前线，没有要把东西都拿走的意思。亚楼还把他所了解的情况告诉我们，尤其对旅大政权交不交的问题，他认为苏联不会把当地政权轻易交给国民党。他认为从对苏利益角度来说，苏方认为旅大掌握在我们手中会对他们更有利。这种看法，与我们地委同志们的看法也是一致的，我们在干部和群众中进行了广泛的宣传教育，认清了政治形势，消除了疑虑，更好地发挥旅大这一后方基地作用，有力地支援了华东及其它解放战争战场。
    亚楼在大连期间，非常勤奋，经常夜以继日的工作。他经验丰富，也善于思考，虽身在苏军，但时时关切着国内解放战争的形势，急切希望投身祖国的解放战场，为党和人民贡献力量。他要我帮助他和中央联系。我把他的情况和要求向东北局做了汇报，不久东北局复电同意他回来工作。后来罗荣桓同志来大连养病，我把亚楼带到罗帅的住处，亚楼当面向罗帅提出了回我军工作的要求。罗帅考虑到当时东北战场正需要人才，亚楼既有国内革命战争经验，也有苏联卫国战争的经验，是个难得的将才，回到我军工作十分适宜。经罗帅的推荐，亚楼转回我军后不久，中央任命他为东北民主联军参谋长，从此他便投身到如火如荼的解放战争中去了。
    和亚楼在大连相处共事虽只有短暂的半年时间，但我们彼此却建立了深厚的革命友情。
    1965年5月7日，亚楼不幸因病长离人间，时年仅55岁。我为失去这位多年相知的挚友而感到万分惋惜和悲痛。亚楼和我们永别了，他为人民的事业所立下的功绩将永留人间。
    谨以此文致祭于亚楼同志墓前，表达一位老朋友对他深深的纪念。
