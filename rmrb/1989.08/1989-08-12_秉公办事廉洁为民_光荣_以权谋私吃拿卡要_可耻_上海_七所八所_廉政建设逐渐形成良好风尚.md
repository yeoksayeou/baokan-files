    Upholding justice and integrity for the people is glorious; using power for personal gain and taking bribes is shameful. Shanghai's "Seven and Eight Offices" are gradually forming a good tradition of clean governance.

    Reporters Liu Shian and Luo Kangxiong report from Shanghai: Over the past year, Shanghai has carried out the "Open Office Procedures, Serve the People with Integrity" education campaign, which has effectively promoted the clean governance of the "Seven and Eight Offices." The slogan "Upholding justice and integrity for the people is glorious; using power for personal gain and taking bribes is shameful" is gradually becoming a common practice in these offices.

    The "Seven and Eight Offices" refer to Shanghai's grassroots law enforcement agencies, administrative management departments, and public utility units, which have a total of over 100,000 public servants. These offices have close relations with the public, and the public often seeks their help. However, in the past, some public servants would "not do anything without benefits, and do things wrongly with benefits," and even take the opportunity to embezzle and accept bribes, which the public strongly disliked. In August last year, Shanghai conducted a pilot program in all 19 districts and counties to launch the "Open Office Procedures, Serve the People with Integrity" education campaign.

    During this campaign, grassroots units have vigorously publicized the exemplary conduct of integrity for the people within their units, exposed the harm caused by corrupt behavior to the party and the state, helped employees improve their ideological understanding, and established the professional ethics that public servants should have.

    On this basis, grassroots units have focused on weak links where public opinion is strong and corruption is likely to occur, such as household registration management in police stations, individual business license applications in industrial and commercial management offices, tax approvals in tax offices, and house repairs in property management offices. They have implemented open office procedures and made the results of office procedures public. Fifteen grassroots units in Huangpu District have successively published 539 office procedures. For example, the Guangdong Road Police Station stipulates that all matters approved within the station must be communicated to the relevant citizens within a week; for matters that need to be reported to relevant departments for approval, they must be reported within 7 days, and the handling results must be communicated in a timely manner. The Dongchang Subdistrict Municipal Affairs Office has made the procedures, processes, opinions of the handling personnel, and approval opinions of the competent departments for private house renovations and individual business license applications, as well as the results of the office procedures, public to the residents, making everything clear at a glance. As a result, there are fewer unreasonable complaints, and those who meet the conditions do not need to "burn incense and kowtow" to get things done. The Luwan District Labor Bureau has made the commercial adjustment policies and results public in the commercial adjustment work for workers across provinces and cities, and the workers who need to be adjusted have given their thumbs up. Last year, the bureau properly solved the commercial adjustment problems of 800 workers.

    Strengthening the supervision and restraint mechanism and seriously investigating and dealing with law-breaking and disciplinary personnel is an important link in carrying out this education campaign. Each grassroots unit has set up a complaint box and complaint hotline, appointed volunteer supervisors, and some department leaders regularly visit enterprises and residents to listen to their opinions. For those who seriously use their power for personal gain and violate laws and disciplines, they are investigated and dealt with one by one to gain the trust of the people. The public security system in the city has appointed more than 2,700 volunteer supervisors. Last year, they focused on investigating and dealing with 211 cases of law-breaking and disciplinary problems of police officers and dealt with 90 people who were not suitable to be police officers. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Administration Department has given disciplinary actions to 21 law-breaking and disciplinary personnel in the first half of this year, and some have been handed over to the judicial authorities for handling.

    This education campaign has promoted the wind of integrity for the people in the "Seven and Eight Offices," and public servants have voluntarily resisted the temptation of unhealthy trends. After the education campaign, public servants in the "Seven and Eight Offices" in Songjiang County have refused 680 invitations to banquets and rejected 390 gifts worth 240,000 yuan. Last year, more than 2,000 police officers in the city's public security system refused gifts worth more than 50,000 yuan.

    Various grassroots units have also taken this opportunity to improve their service attitudes and solve problems for the people. The Fanglin Subdistrict Property Management Office in Xuhui District has extended the time for repairing residents' houses. In the past, it was difficult for residents to apply for gas installation due to complicated procedures. In July this year, the Gas Company launched a "one-stop" service for gas installation applications, which greatly facilitated the public. The company's liquefied gas station has also added 3 new liquefied gas supply stations, allowing 180,000 liquefied gas users to exchange liquefied gas cylinders nearby.

    秉公办事廉洁为民　光荣  以权谋私吃拿卡要　可耻
    上海“七所八所”廉政建设逐渐形成良好风尚
    本报上海8月12日电　本报记者刘士安、新华社记者罗康雄报道：上海市开展“公开办事制度，廉洁为民”教育活动一年来，有效地促进了“七所八所”的廉政建设。“秉公办事，廉洁为民光荣，以权谋私，吃拿卡要可耻”，在这些单位逐渐形成风尚。
    上海市基层执法部门、行政管理部门和公用事业单位被群众通称为七所八所，共有公职人员10万余人。这些单位与群众关系密切，群众常有求于他们。而过去少数公职人员“没有好处不办事，有了好处乱办事”，甚至趁机贪污受贿，群众对此强烈不满。去年8月，上海市经过试点在全市19个区、县开展了“公开办事制度，廉洁为民”的教育活动。
    各基层单位在开展这项教育活动中，大张旗鼓地宣传本单位廉洁为民的典型，揭露不廉洁行为给党和国家的事业带来的危害，帮助职工提高思想认识，树立国家公职人员应有的职业道德观念。
    在此基础上，各基层单位抓住群众意见较大、容易产生腐败现象的薄弱环节，如派出所的户口管理，工商管理所的个体户申请执照，税务所的税收审批，房管所的房屋维修等，实行公开办事，公开办事结果。黄浦区15个基层单位先后公布了539条办事制度。如广东路派出所规定凡所内审批的事，一周内要向有关市民告知结果；对要上报有关部门审批的，要在7天内上报，并及时告知处理结果。东昌街道市政科把私房翻建和个体户申请执照的手续、程序、经办人意见、主管部门审批意见以及办事结果公布于众，居民看了一目了然。结果无理取闹的人少了，符合条件的不用“烧香拜佛”也能办成事。卢湾区劳动局在跨省、市工人的商调工作中，把商调政策、结果公开，要求商调的人员对此拍手叫好。去年全局妥善解决了800名工人的商调问题。
    健全监督制约机制，严肃查处违法违纪人员，是搞好这项教育活动的重要一环。各基层都设立了举报箱、举报电话，聘请了义务监督员，有的部门的领导干部还定期走访企业和居民，听取他们的意见。对严重以权谋私的违法违纪人员，发现一起，查处一起，做到取信于民。全市公安系统聘请了2700多名义务监督员，去年重点查处了211名干警的违法违纪问题，处理了90名不适宜担任干警的人员。上海市工商部门今年上半年对21名违法违纪人员分别给予了处分，有的被移送司法部门处理。
    这次教育使“七所八所”的公职人员廉洁为民的风气得到发扬，纷纷自觉抵制不正之风的诱惑。松江县“七所八所”的公职人员在开展教育活动后，谢绝宴请680余人次，拒收价值2.4万元的各类礼品390余件。全市公安系统去年有2000多人次的干警拒收礼品，价值5万多元。
    各基层单位还借这股东风，改善服务态度，为群众排忧解难。徐汇区枫林街道房管所延长为居民修理房屋的时间。过去，居民申请安装煤气困难重重，手续繁多。今年7月，煤气公司开展了申请安装煤气的“一条龙”服务，大大方便了群众。煤气公司的液化所还新增设了3个液化气供应站，使18万液化气用户能就近调换液化气罐。
