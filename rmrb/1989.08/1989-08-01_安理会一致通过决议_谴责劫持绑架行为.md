The United Nations Security Council today unanimously passed a resolution condemning all acts of hostage-taking and kidnapping, and demanding the immediate and safe release of all hostages and kidnapped individuals.

The resolution, jointly proposed by Canada and Finland, was put to a vote after prior consultations and was passed with 15 votes in favor and no opposition. The resolution noted that the Security Council is deeply concerned about the frequent occurrences of hostage-taking and kidnapping, in which many hostages are still being held for long periods.

The resolution calls on all countries to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, and to use their political influence to ensure the safe release of all hostages and kidnapped individuals, and to prevent such acts from occurring.

The Security Council urges all countries to sign the international convention against hostage-taking and to further develop international cooperation to formulate and implement effective measures in accordance with international law to prevent, prosecute, and punish all acts of international terrorism involving hostage-taking and kidnapping.

The Security Council President Pejic said at the meeting that today's discussion on the resolution regarding hostage-taking was held under the shadow of recent hostage incidents, including the possible killing of UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, Colonel Higgins. Pejic pointed out that these incidents further highlight the necessity of taking effective international actions on the issues of hostages and kidnapping.

    安理会一致通过决议
    谴责劫持绑架行为
    本报联合国7月31日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天一致通过决议，谴责一切劫持人质和绑架的行为，并要求立即安全释放一切人质和被绑架人士。
    这项由加拿大和芬兰共同提出的决议草案，经过事前磋商在会上表决时，15票赞成，无反对票。决议指出，安理会对劫持人质和绑架事件频频发生，其中许多人质仍被长期监禁，深感不安。
    决议要求世界各国按照《联合国宪章》和国际法准则，利用其政治影响，确保一切人质和被绑架人士获得安全释放，并防止发生劫持人质和绑架行为。
    安理会呼吁世界各国都参加签署反对劫持人质的国际公约，并敦促各国进一步发展国际合作，拟订和采取符合国际法准则的有效措施，以便防止、起诉和惩处一切劫持人质和绑架的国际恐怖主义活动。
    安理会本月主席佩伊奇在会上说，会议今天审议关于劫持人质的决议是在最近一些有关人质事件的阴影下进行的，其中包括联合国维持黎巴嫩和平部队希金斯中校今天可能已被杀害的报道。佩伊奇指出，这些事件更清楚地表明在人质和绑架问题上采取国际有效行动的必要性。
