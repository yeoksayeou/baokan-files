The fifth Asian Men's Handball Championship and the second Asian Women's Handball Championship opened tonight at the Yuetan Sports Gymnasium in Beijing. In the first match, the Chinese men's handball team lost to the strong Middle Eastern team from Kuwait, 18 to 22.

The Chinese team, composed of young players, initially scored first, but the situation on the court changed rapidly a few minutes later. The experienced Kuwaiti team quickly took control, using a "3-2-1" defensive formation to effectively neutralize the threat from China's two main shooters. They also employed tight man-to-man defense, forcing the Chinese team to operate on the perimeter. Although the Kuwaiti team did not have a height advantage, their active movement and flexible tactics were evident. In attack, they remained calm and composed, varying their tactics and primarily using quick cuts, combined with various positional interchanges. The movements of the two wingers were particularly effective, making it difficult for the Chinese players to defend against them. By halftime, Kuwait led 13 to 8.

In the second half, the Chinese team struggled to change their tactics when their direct attacks were blocked. The two wingers failed to make an impact, and the team's coordination in terms of screening, passing, and shooting was poor. They found it almost impossible to jump for shots, resulting in a low success rate for their attacks.

This match also highlighted the Chinese team's individual weaknesses, rigid and monotonous tactics, and lack of speed, agility, and versatility.

Before the first match, a grand opening ceremony was held. The president of the Asian Handball Federation, Prince Fahd, and the first vice-president, Abul, along with the honorary chairman of the Chinese Handball Association, Hong Xuezhi, the director of the State Sports Commission, Wu Shaozu, deputy director He Zhenliang, and the director of the organizing committee for this tournament, Zhang Baifa, attended the event and watched the match.

    亚洲手球锦标赛在京开幕
    首场比赛中国队负于科威特队
    本报北京8月20日讯　记者李北大、缪鲁报道：第五届亚洲男子手球锦标赛和第二届亚洲女子手球锦标赛今天晚上在北京月坛体育馆开幕。首场比赛，中国男子手球队以18∶22负于西亚劲旅科威特队。
    由年轻队员组成的中国队在这场比赛中抢先得手，但几分钟后，场上局势骤变，经验丰富的科威特队随即控制了场上的主动权，他们以“三二一”防守队形成功地瓦解了中国队两名射手的威力，并以紧凑的联防迫使中国队在外围游动。科威特队虽然身高不占优势，但跑动积极，打法灵活。进攻时，沉着冷静，战术多变，以连切为主，兼有各种位置的穿插。两名边锋的跑动配合，令中国队员防不胜防。上半场，科威特队以13∶8领先。
    下半场，中国队在正面进攻受阻的情况下，未能很好改变战术路线，两位边锋的作用没发挥出来。队员们之间掩护、接应、射门等串联动作漏洞明显，几乎难以跃起攻门，进攻成功率打折扣。
    这场比赛还反映出，中国队个人作战能力差，战术死板单调，未能表现出快速灵活多变的特点。
    在首场比赛前，举行了隆重的开幕仪式，亚洲手球联合会主席法赫德亲王和第一副主席阿布尔以及中国手球协会名誉主席洪学智、国家体委主任伍绍祖、副主任何振梁和本届比赛组委会主任张百发等出席了大会，并观看了比赛。
