Greek government spokesman Kanilopoulos announced on August 22 that the Greek government has lodged a protest with the United States over the violation of Greek airspace by U.S. Air Force fighter jets.

Kanilopoulos said that the U.S. Air Force fighter jets had violated Greek airspace over Crete Island on two separate occasions. In the first incident, two U.S. fighter jets that had entered Greek airspace immediately changed course after receiving a warning from the Greek side, while one of them sped up and crossed over Crete Island. In the second incident, Greek fighter jets were scrambled to intercept two U.S. fighter jets that had entered Crete Island's airspace, but one of them still sped up and crossed the Greek border.

    美机侵犯希腊领空  希腊政府提出抗议
    希腊政府发言人卡尼洛普洛斯8月22日宣布，希腊政府已就美国空军战斗机侵犯希腊领空事件向美国表示了抗议。
    卡尼洛普洛斯说，美空军战斗机前后两次侵犯了希腊克里特岛的领空。在第一次事件中，侵犯领空的两架美直升战斗机在接到希腊方面的警告后，一架立刻改变航向，而另一架则加速穿过了克里特岛上空。在第二次事件中，希腊方面出动了直升战斗机拦截已侵入克里特岛上空的两架美战斗机，但其中一架还是加速越过了希腊边界。
