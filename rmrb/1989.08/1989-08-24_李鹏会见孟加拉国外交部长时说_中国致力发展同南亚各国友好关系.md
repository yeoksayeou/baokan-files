Premier Li Peng met with the visiting Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud and his delegation in the Zhongnanhai's Ziguang Pavilion this afternoon. The two sides had a friendly and cordial conversation.

Premier Li Peng first extended a warm welcome to Foreign Minister Mahmud for his visit as a representative of a friendly neighboring country. Foreign Minister Mahmud expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality extended by the Chinese government to him, his wife, and his delegation. He also conveyed President Ershad's good wishes to the Chinese leadership. He said that Bangladesh considers China to be its best friend and that the purpose of this visit is to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. Premier Li Peng asked Foreign Minister Mahmud to convey his greetings to President Ershad, the Prime Minister, and other leaders upon his return to Bangladesh. He expressed China's willingness to strengthen and develop various forms of economic cooperation with Bangladesh.

Premier Li Peng said that South Asia is China's neighboring region, and China naturally pays close attention to this area. All South Asian countries are developing countries with the common task of developing their economies to improve the living standards of their people. The Chinese government has always been committed to developing friendly relations with South Asian countries and hopes that South Asian countries will resolve their problems and disputes on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Foreign Minister Mahmud expressed his gratitude for China's support and assistance in water management, noting that Bangladesh is a country frequently affected by floods. He also hoped to learn more from China's experience in water management. Premier Li Peng introduced the situation of China's flood control efforts. He said that the Yellow River has changed its course many times over the past two thousand years, bringing great disasters to the Chinese people. Since the founding of New China, through the joint efforts of the government and the people, extensive flood control measures have been implemented, including building dams upstream, constructing dikes downstream, and planting trees and grass on both banks. Over the past 40 years, there have been no major floods, and the water of the Yellow River has been utilized for agricultural irrigation, benefiting the people along the river. Of course, this does not mean that the Yellow River has been completely controlled; currently, it can only defend against floods that occur once every 40 years, so efforts must continue to be made to control it.

Foreign Minister Mahmud said that President Ershad looks forward to Premier Li Peng's visit to Bangladesh and believes that Premier Li Peng's visit will further strengthen the traditional friendship between the two countries. Premier Li Peng thanked President Ershad for the invitation and expressed his delight at the opportunity to visit Bangladesh later this year.

    李鹏会见孟加拉国外交部长时说
    中国致力发展同南亚各国友好关系
    本报北京8月24日讯　记者孙毅报道：国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了应邀来访的孟加拉国外交部长阿尼斯·伊斯拉姆·马赫穆德一行，宾主进行了亲切友好的交谈。
    李鹏总理首先对马赫穆德作为友好邻邦的外长访华表示热烈欢迎。马赫穆德外长表示感谢中国政府对他本人、他的夫人和代表团的热情款待，并转达了艾尔沙德总统对中国领导人的良好祝愿。他说，孟加拉国认为，中国是孟加拉国最好的朋友，这次访问的目的就是为了进一步加强两国之间的友好关系。李鹏总理请马赫穆德外长回国后转达中国领导人对艾尔沙德总统、总理和其他领导人的问候。他表示，中国愿意加强和发展同孟加拉国的多种形式的经济合作。
    李鹏总理说，南亚是中国的近邻，中国自然对这个地区很关心。南亚各国都是发展中国家，都有发展经济的共同任务，以便提高人民的生活水平。中国政府一贯致力于发展同南亚各国的友好关系，同时希望南亚各国在和平共处五项原则的基础上解决彼此之间的问题和争端。
    马赫穆德外长表示，孟加拉国是个多水灾的国家，感谢中国在治水方面的支持和帮助。他还希望从中国治水经验中获得更多的知识。李总理向客人们介绍了中国治理水患的情况。他说，黄河在两千年历史上曾多次改道，给中国人民带来深重的灾难。新中国成立后，由于政府和人民的共同努力，进行大力治理，上游筑坝，下游修堤，两岸栽树种草，40年来没有发生大的泛滥，并利用黄河之水进行农业灌溉，造福于沿岸人民。当然这不是说黄河已经完全治理好，目前只能防御40年一遇的洪水，因此还要下力气继续治理。
    马赫穆德外长说，艾尔沙德总统期待着李总理对孟加拉国进行访问，相信李总理的访问将进一步加强两国之间的传统友谊。李鹏总理感谢艾尔沙德总统的邀请，并对今年晚些时候有机会访问孟加拉国感到非常高兴。
