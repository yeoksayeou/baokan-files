The highly anticipated construction project of the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Citrus Belt is progressing smoothly. According to the person in charge of this project, it has been approved by the State Planning Commission and large-scale construction will begin this year. The $63.5 million loan from the World Bank will be formally signed in Washington, D.C., this October.

The Upper and Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Citrus Belt is currently the largest fruit development project in China. It starts from Yibin in Sichuan and extends to Qichun in Hubei, spanning the world-renowned Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Since 1986, the Ministry of Agriculture has organized domestic and foreign experts to conduct multiple surveys and discussions, selecting 29 counties (cities) along the river in Sichuan, Hubei, and Chongqing as the construction area for the "Citrus Belt," with 13 counties (cities) as the key construction areas.

Expert survey data shows that these 29 counties (cities) have over 6.59 million mu of barren hills and mountains suitable for fruit development. The land here is fertile, the climate is mild, and the rainfall is abundant, making it highly suitable for the production of citrus fruits as well as lychees, longans, loquats, kiwifruits, and other high-quality fruits. Many regions also have a long history of fruit cultivation, making it an ideal area for the development of citrus and other fruit trees.

It is understood that the "Citrus Belt" plans to be completed in five years. The main tasks include building a number of high-standard new orchards and renovating old ones; establishing a supporting system for the breeding of high-quality fruit tree varieties; building a system for fruit tree research, technology promotion, training, experimentation, demonstration, and services; constructing fruit processing plants, and improving and completing transportation and other production facilities to achieve a coordinated development of production, supply, sales, and the integration of industry, agriculture, and commerce.

    国内最大水果基地开发项目
    长江上中游柑桔带即将兴建
    新华社武汉8月13日电　（记者陈新洲）令人瞩目的长江上中游柑桔带建设项目进展顺利。据此项工作的负责人透露，这一建设项目已获国家计委批准，年内即将展开大规模的施工；世界银行确定提供的6350万美元贷款，将于今年10月在美国华盛顿正式签字。
    长江上中游柑桔带是我国目前最大的水果开发项目，它上起四川宜宾，下至湖北蕲春，中跨举世闻名的长江三峡。1986年以来，农业部组织中外专家对这里进行了多次考察论证，从而选定川、鄂和重庆市所辖的29个沿江县（市）为“柑桔带”建设区，其中重点建设区有13个县（市）。
    专家提供的考察资料表明，这29个县（市）共有659万多亩宜果荒山丘陵可以开发利用。这里土地肥沃，气候温和，雨水丰沛，十分适宜柑桔以及荔枝、龙眼、枇杷、猕猴桃等名优水果生产，不少地区还具有悠久的水果栽培历史，是发展以柑桔为主的多种果树的理想区域。
    据了解，“柑桔带”计划用5年时间建成。主要建设一批高标准的新果园和改造老果园；建设果树良种繁育配套体系；建设果树科研、技术推广、培训、试验、示范和服务体系；建设水果加工厂，配置和完善交通运输等生产设施，实现产供销、贸工农相互配套。
