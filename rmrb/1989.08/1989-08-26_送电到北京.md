The winding and undulating mountains of the North Peak Hengshan range stand tall with towering power transmission towers reaching into the clouds. Twenty-four silver wires, each as thick as a cup's mouth, pass through these towers, stretching from Datong to the east, towards Beijing! This is the Datong to Beijing 500kV double-circuit ultra-high-voltage power transmission line. The strong mountain winds play with the 24 silver wires on the towers, creating a melody of dedication: Shanxi sends 11 million kWh of electricity to Beijing daily, accounting for about one-quarter of Beijing's total daily electricity consumption.

Shanxi is a land rich in coal, with unparalleled advantages for developing thermal power. However, the neighboring capital, Beijing, faces severe power shortages. Supplying electricity to Beijing is not only the wish of the people of Beijing but also the responsibility of the people of Shanxi. With the support of the State Council, 5 billion yuan has been invested in Shanxi. The 70,000 power industry workers of Shanxi have been working tirelessly, and the broad masses of the people of Shanxi have been fully supporting the power construction, just as they supported the frontlines in the past. Therefore, the power construction has achieved a development speed unmatched by any other period in history. In 1984, the Datong Second Power Plant produced two 200,000 kW units in one year, a first in the country; in 1985, the entire province produced 700,000 kW of large and medium-sized units in one year, another first in the country. The power industry workers have dedicated their blood, wisdom, effort, and consciousness to build a pillar of light.

The Shenhua Power Plant and the Datong Second Power Plant, two large power plants with a capacity of 1 million kW each, have been completed. The 500kV power transmission lines from Datong to Beijing and from Shenhua to Datong have been built. For the first time, the North China region has seen 500kV ultra-high-voltage electricity. Two "sky bridges" for transmitting electricity have tightly connected Jin (Shanxi) and Jing (Beijing). Shanxi's power supply capacity to the capital has reached 1 million kW. Despite the tight power supply in Shanxi, the people of Shanxi prioritize the overall situation and strive to send electricity to Beijing. Beijing, with the power supply from Shanxi, can create 40 billion yuan in industrial output value annually. Since 1984, Shanxi has been supplying electricity to Beijing, accumulating a total of 2 billion kWh. In addition, electricity has been exported to Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and other places. Shanxi has become the province with the highest electricity export in the country.

    送电到北京
    蜿蜒起伏的北岳恒山山脉，一座座巍峨的输电铁塔直耸云端。24根杯口粗的银线通过铁塔，由大同向东，飞向北京！这就是大同至北京双回50万伏超高压输电线路。强劲的山风弹着铁塔上的24根银线，奏出了一曲奉献之歌：山西每天向北京送电1100多万千瓦时，相当于北京每天总用电量的1／4。
    山西，是一个煤的世界，发展火电具有得天独厚的条件，而近邻首都北京却缺电严重。向首都北京送电，不仅是北京人的愿望，也是山西人的责任。在国务院的支持下，50亿元资金陆续投入到了山西。山西的7万名电业职工，紧张地投入了战斗，山西广大的人民群众，像当年支援前线那样，全力支援电力建设。因此，电力建设创造了历史上任何一个时期都无法比拟的发展速度。1984年，大同二电厂一年投产两台20万千瓦机组，为国内首创；1985年，全省一年投产70万千瓦大中型机组，为国内首创。广大电业职工用心血、用智慧、用干劲、用觉悟，铸就了光明的支柱。
    神头发电厂和大同第二发电厂两座百万千瓦的大型电厂建成了。大同到北京双回、神头到大同50万伏输电线路建起来了。华北地区第一次出现了50万伏超高压电流。两条输送电力的“空中长廊”把晋京紧紧联结在一起，山西向首都送电能力达到100万千瓦。尽管山西的电力很紧张，山西人还是以大局为重，竭尽全力向北京送电。北京呢？有了山西的电力，每年可创造400亿元工业产值。山西从1984年开始向北京送电，累计已达到200亿千瓦时。此外，还向天津、河北、内蒙古、陕西等地输出了电力，山西已成为全国电力输出最多的省份。
