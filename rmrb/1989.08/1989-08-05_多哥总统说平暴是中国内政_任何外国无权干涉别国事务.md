Xinhua News Agency, Lome, August 4th.

Togo's President Gnassingbé Eyadéma today met with China's Ambassador to Togo, Li Peiyi, in Lome. Eyadéma stated that the measures taken by the Chinese government in early June to suppress the riots in Beijing were necessary actions that a sovereign state must take in its internal affairs.

Eyadéma said that any country facing such incidents has the right to take necessary measures. According to the United Nations Charter, no foreign country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another country.

Li Peiyi provided a detailed account of the development of the incident to Eyadéma. Both sides also discussed strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries.
