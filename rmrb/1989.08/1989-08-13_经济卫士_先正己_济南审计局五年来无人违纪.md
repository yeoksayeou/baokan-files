    "Economic Guardians" First Rectify Themselves
    Jinan Audit Bureau Has No Violations in Five Years

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 13th (reporter Jiang Yongwu) Recently, during the "Inspect Integrity, Discuss Diligence" activity in the Jinan Municipal Government offices, a good story emerged: the Jinan Municipal Audit Bureau, established over five years ago, has had more than a hundred staff members conduct audits in over 2,100 enterprises and institutions. No one has been found to have engaged in violations such as accepting gifts or bribes. The bureau has been named an advanced unit in municipal clean governance and an advanced unit in provincial spiritual civilization.

    As the city's "economic guardians," the first meeting of the bureau's party group after its establishment in 1983 was to discuss "how to build a clean and upright audit team." When selecting cadres, the first criterion was "does this person possess fair and upright, clean and upright qualities?" The first lesson given to new cadres was "what kind of professional ethics should an audit cadre possess?"

    To ensure that various clean governance regulations are implemented, they start with small matters. Before auditing an enterprise or institution, they declare to the unit, "We are checking your financial discipline, please supervise our clean governance situation." After auditing a unit, the bureau sends someone to visit the unit to check if the auditors had any violations. If any signs are found, they are promptly and seriously dealt with. An auditor, while auditing a unit, borrowed 70 yuan due to an urgent matter and returned it the next day. For such a "small matter," the bureau still treated it as a "negative sign" and gave a serious criticism.

    In 1988 alone, the bureau declined over 120 invitations to dine and rejected 65 gifts. The bureau requires auditors to clearly inform the units they are auditing: "We do not accept invitations, and we do not add dishes, to avoid embarrassment for both parties."

    “经济卫士”先正己
    济南审计局五年来无人违纪
    据新华社济南8月13日电（记者蒋永武）最近，济南市政府机关在“查廉洁、议勤政”活动中传出佳话：市审计局成立5年多来，百余名工作人员曾先后到2100多个企事业单位开展审计工作，尚未发现一人有吃请受礼等违纪现象，被评为市廉政建设先进单位、省精神文明先进单位。
    作为全市“经济卫士”的审计局，1983年局党组组成后的第一次党组会，就是研究“如何建设一支廉洁奉公的审计队伍？”选调干部时考察的第一个项目是“此人是否具有公道正派、廉洁奉公的品质？”给新调进干部上的第一堂课是“审计干部必须具备什么样的职业道德？”
    为把廉政建设的各种规章制度落到实处，他们从小事做起。每审计一个企事业单位，都先向该单位声明，“我们检查你们的财经纪律，请你们监督我们的廉政情况。”每审计过一个单位，局里就派人回访一个单位，看审计人员在该单位是否有违纪现象，发现苗头，及时地严肃处理。有个审计干部在一个单位审计时，因急事需要向这个单位借了70元钱，第二天就还上了。对于这样一件“小事”，局里还作为“不良苗头”，严肃批评。
    这个审计局仅1988年就先后120多次谢绝赴宴，65次拒收礼品。局里要审计干部到被审计单位工作时，先给该单位交待清楚：不吃请，不加菜，以免双方都难堪。
