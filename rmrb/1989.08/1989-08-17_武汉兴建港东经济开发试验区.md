Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 17th.

Wuhan is currently constructing the Donggang Economic Development Experimental Zone in the Qingshan District to further attract foreign investment, advanced technology, and scientific management experience.

Qingshan District is an industrial area and a metallurgical industrial base. It has abundant industrial resources and strong technical capabilities. The transportation and communication conditions are also very favorable. Since last year, Wuhan has designated 200 mu (approximately 33 acres) of land 1.5 kilometers from the center of Qingshan City for the development zone. The preparatory work for the zone has been completed, and agreements have already been signed with some Hong Kong companies to produce polyurethane shoes and aluminum electrolytic capacitors. After visiting the site, some foreign investors and domestic enterprises believe that this development zone has excellent conditions.

    武汉兴建港东经济开发试验区
    据新华社武汉8月17日电　武汉市目前正在青山区兴建港东经济开发试验小区，以便于进一步引进外资、先进技术和科学管理经验。
    青山区是工业城区，也是冶金工业基地。这里有丰富的工业资源、雄厚的技术力量，交通、通讯条件也十分优越。从去年开始，武汉市已在距青山城区中心1.5公里处划出200亩土地，现已完成了开发区的筹建工作，并已与香港一些公司签订了生产聚胺脂皮鞋和铝电解电容器的协议。一些外商和国内部分厂家在实地考察后认为，这个开发区具有良好条件。
