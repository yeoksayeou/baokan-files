During the period of student unrest, turmoil, and eventually counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the Party branches of the Class of 1989 in the Department of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering and the Class of 1989 in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University led all party members and many students to continue their studies. They did not participate in activities such as storming Zhongnanhai, sit-ins, or hunger strikes. They clearly opposed the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, becoming advanced Party branches in the midst of the bloody struggle.

These two Party branches are composed of graduating students, with a total of 26 party members. At that time, under the complex political climate, including some party members, there were different views on many issues, especially regarding the People's Daily editorial "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil." The Party branch of the Class of 1989 in the Department of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering faced this situation and held a full-member meeting that night to discuss the nature of the "turmoil." The branch secretary and graduating student Liang Haibo pointed out: "We allow a few comrades to have different opinions, but as a Communist Party member, one must act in high unity with the Party Central Committee and not participate in the turmoil. This is a basic discipline that party members must follow." Under the arrangement of the branch, party members went to persuade classmates not to participate in the large-scale parade on the 27th. However, some still wanted to participate in the parade.

"I do not support the parade! We cannot participate in this parade!" Probationary party member Zhuang Guangming firmly said. Zhuang Guangming stated his views: "The People's Daily editorial has pointed out that the student movement has turned into turmoil. If we go out to parade again, it will only add to the turmoil, harm the interests of the Party and the people, and destroy the hard-won stable situation." On the same evening, the water engineering class also discussed whether to participate in the large-scale parade on the 27th. The five Communist Party members in the class successively expressed their opposition to the parade. Under their influence, many students in this department did not participate in that parade.

The Party branch of the Class of 1989 in the Department of Electrical Engineering also experienced a similar struggle. Some students in this department also requested the class to organize a parade on the 26th. Party branch secretary He Hongtao gathered the party members and said: "We Communist Party members must resolutely oppose participating in this parade." All party members in the branch agreed with his opinion. The class teacher, Dou Yulin, also supported his opinion. The next day, no party members from this branch participated in the parade, and many students who originally planned to participate also withdrew.

During the days of turmoil and riots in the capital, these two Party branches underwent severe tests. The electrical engineering class is an advanced class in the school. In mid-April, most of the 25 classes in this department went on strike. One day, a few students in the department found the class monitor and Communist Party member Liao Li, asking him to sign to approve the strike, which was firmly rejected. Liao Li said: "The strike is a great loss to us individually and to the country. Moreover, many students in the class do not agree to the strike, and the Communist Party members in the class are even more opposed to the strike." He continued: "Those who advocate for the strike are only a minority. The minority must follow the majority's opinion and consider the interests of the majority." Someone said: "Other classes are all on strike, and an advanced class not striking is a disgrace." Liao Li said: "You have the freedom to strike, and we have the freedom not to strike. We do not strike, which is the glory of an advanced class." His words left those few students speechless. The electrical engineering class maintained normal teaching order during the most intense days of the turmoil and riots and never missed a day of class. Those few students who advocated for the strike were deeply educated. Students in the Class of 1989 in the Department of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering also carried out their graduation design and wrote their graduation theses according to the plan during this period.

These two Party branches also consistently carried out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work during the struggle, enabling many students to actively participate in the struggle against the turmoil and riots. For a period, there were many people in the Department of Electrical Engineering who spread and believed in rumors. The Party branch of the Class of 1989 in the Department of Electrical Engineering realized that rumors were an important cause of students' confusion and required party members to talk to students and do a good job of refuting rumors. They led by example, and soon eliminated the influence of rumors such as police beating people and the massacre at Zhongnanhai on students. These two branches had relatively strict requirements for party members. A few party members in the Party branch of the Class of 1989 in the Department of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering had participated in some parade activities. After the branch discovered this, it seriously criticized the relevant party members and held a branch meeting to help and educate them. After April 27, none of the 16 party members in this branch participated in parade activities, and not even a single big-character poster was posted.

The main reason these two student Party branches could fully play the role of a fighting fortress is that the leadership team was relatively strong and paid attention to the collective leadership. Whenever they encountered major issues, they would promptly convene a branch committee meeting, conduct thorough discussions, and then make a resolution. The Party branch of the Class of 1989 in the Department of Hydraulic and Electric Engineering has basically maintained a bi-weekly organizational life meeting in recent years.

During this period of turmoil and riots, when party members had differing opinions on issues, they would promptly convene a party member meeting, exchange views, unify understanding, and unify actions. They also promptly reported important information about the turmoil and riots to party members, enabling them to accurately grasp the political situation and clearly understand the direction of the struggle.

### 狂潮中站稳脚跟　旋涡里旗帜鲜明  清华两学生党支部带领党员反动乱

    狂潮中站稳脚跟　旋涡里旗帜鲜明
    清华两学生党支部带领党员反动乱
    新华社北京8月6日电　（记者黄智敏）在北京发生学潮、动乱直至反革命暴乱期间，清华大学水电系四字班党支部和电机系生电四党支部带领全体党员和许多同学坚持学习，未参与冲击新华门、静坐、绝食等活动，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱和反革命暴乱，成为在血与火的斗争中的先进党支部。
    这两个支部均系应届毕业班的学生党支部，共有党员26名。在当时那种复杂的政治气候下，包括党员在内的一些同学，对许多问题有着不同的看法，特别是对人民日报社论《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》，出现不同反响。水电系四字班党支部面对这种状况，于当天夜里召开全体党员大会，对“动乱”定性问题展开争论。党支部书记、应届毕业生梁海波指出：“允许少数同志有不同的看法，但作为一名共产党员必须在行动上同党中央保持高度一致，不能参加到动乱的行列中去，这是党员应遵守的一条基本的纪律。”在支部的安排下，党员们分头劝阻同学不要参加27日的大游行。可是，仍有些人要求参加游行。
    “我不赞成游行！我们不能参加这次游行！”预备党员庄光明坚定地说。庄光明陈述了自己的意见：“人民日报社论已经指出学潮变成了动乱，如果我们再上街游行，就是助了动乱之威，损害了党和人民的利益，破坏了来之不易的安定局面。”同一天晚上，这个年级的水工四一班又在争论参加不参加27日的大游行问题。班上的5名共产党员先后表示不赞成参加游行。在他们的带动下，这个系的许多同学都没有去参加那次游行。
    电机系生电四支部也经历了类似的斗争。这个系的一些同学在26日那天也要求班上出面组织游行。党支部书记何洪涛把党员找在一起说：“我们共产党员要坚决反对参加这次游行。”党支部所有的党员赞同他的意见。班主任窦玉琴老师也支持他的意见。第二天，这个支部的党员无一人去参加游行，许多原来准备去参加游行的同学也退出了队伍。
    在首都发生动乱暴乱的日子里，这两个党支部经历了严峻的考验。电机系电四班是校系的先进班集体。4月中旬，这个系的25个班绝大多数都罢课了。一天，系里有几名同学找到班长、共产党员廖理，要他签字同意罢课，被严辞拒绝。廖理说：“罢课对我们个人和国家来说，都是极大的损失。再说，班里好多同学也不同意罢课，班里的共产党员更是反对罢课。”他接着说：“主张罢课的只是少数人。少数人要服从多数人的意见，要照顾多数人的利益。”还有人说：“别的班都罢课了，一个先进班集体不罢课，是个耻辱”。廖理说：“你们有罢课的自由，我们也有不罢课的自由。我们不罢课，正是先进班集体的光荣。”他的一番话，说得那几个同学无言对答。电四班在动乱暴乱斗争最激烈的日子里，也坚持正常的教学秩序，没有罢过一天课。那几个主张罢课的同学受到深刻教育。水电系四字班的同学，在这期间也按照计划照常进行毕业设计、撰写毕业论文。
    这两个党支部在斗争中还始终坚持做深入细致的思想政治工作，使许多同学积极参加反对动乱暴乱的斗争。有一段时间，在电机系传谣信谣的人不少。生电四党支部意识到谣言是造成同学思想混乱的一个重要原因，便要求党员找同学谈心，做好辟谣工作。他们因势利导，举一反三，很快消除了警察打人、血洗新华门等谣言对同学的影响。这两个支部对党员要求比较严格。水电系四字班支部有个别党员曾参加过一些游行活动。支部发现后，对有关党员提出了严肃的批评，还召开支部大会进行帮助教育。从4月27日之后，这个支部的16名党员再无人参加游行等活动了，甚至连一张大小字报也无人张贴过。
    这两个学生党支部能充分发挥战斗堡垒作用主要是因为支部领导班子比较强，注意发挥集体领导的作用。凡遇到重大问题，他们都及时召开支委会，进行充分讨论，然后作出决议。水电系四字班党支部在近几年中，基本坚持了半月一次的组织生活会。
    在这次动乱暴乱期间，当党员对问题发生意见分歧时，他们还随时召开党员大会，交流看法，统一认识，统一行动，并及时向党员通报动乱暴乱的重要情况，使党员准确地把握政治动向，明确斗争方向。
