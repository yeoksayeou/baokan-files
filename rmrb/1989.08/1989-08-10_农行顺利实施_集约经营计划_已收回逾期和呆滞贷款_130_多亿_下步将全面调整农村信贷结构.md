The Agricultural Bank of China has been successfully implementing its "Intensive Management Plan" since early 1988. After more than a year, the plan has made significant progress and shown initial results, and it is now entering its second phase.

This plan uses systems engineering management methods to promote the reform and development of the Agricultural Bank, aiming to improve its management level. The main contents include cleaning up loan assets, adjusting the credit structure, implementing the branch manager responsibility system, upgrading financial enterprises, and comprehensively improving the quality of employees.

Cleaning up loan assets is the first step in implementing the "Intensive Management Plan." Nearly 100,000 people from the national rural financial system participated in this work. Through the cleanup, the amount and composition of unreasonable loan occupations were basically identified. During the cleanup, 13.152 billion yuan in overdue and non-performing loans were recovered. At the same time, risk management was strengthened for loans with potential risks, and a classification, registration, and assessment system for non-standard loans was established. Currently, the loan cleanup work is nearing completion, and the "Intensive Management Plan" will enter the stage of adjusting the credit structure.

According to analysis, the current rural credit structure is still not reasonable. The main problems are insufficient agricultural loans, an overly large proportion of policy loans for agricultural and sideline product procurement, and unsecured funding sources. There is also a significant amount of low-level duplication in industrial enterprises, with a high proportion of loans to third-class and closed enterprises. Long-term agricultural loans are relatively few, and the proportion of non-standard loan occupations is high. The Agricultural Bank plans to take two years to comprehensively adjust the industrial structure, enterprise structure, and fund structure of rural credit, so that limited credit funds can be reasonably allocated among different industries, enterprises, and products, supporting the coordinated development of the rural economy.

Deputy Governor of the Agricultural Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, told reporters that from now until the first half of next year, the Agricultural Bank will start adjusting the credit fund structure, focusing on recovering overdue and non-performing loans, thereby driving the adjustment of the credit industry structure and enterprise structure. He emphasized the need to establish a responsibility system for recovering overdue and non-performing loans, assigning recovery tasks to each level of the bank, each department, and each individual. He reiterated: recovered overdue loans will not be used by higher-level banks, and supported loans will not be deducted; for enterprises that actively repay overdue and non-performing loans, interest settlements can be exempted or reduced according to regulations; for debtors who have the money but refuse to repay, typical cases will be selected for litigation; for loans recovered by organizations and individuals outside the bank, handling fees can be paid according to regulations.

    农行顺利实施“集约经营计划”
    已收回逾期和呆滞贷款130多亿  下步将全面调整农村信贷结构
    本报讯　记者江夏报道：中国农业银行自1988年初开始制订和实施的“集约经营计划”，一年多来进展顺利，初见成果，目前已进入第二阶段。
    这项计划运用系统工程管理方法，推进农行改革和发展，提高其经营管理水平，内容主要包括清理贷款资产、调整信贷结构、推行行长负责制、开展金融企业升级、全面提高职工素质等。
    清理贷款资产是实施“集约经营计划”的第一步。全国农村金融系统近10万人参加了这项工作。通过清理，基本查清了不合理占用贷款的数额和构成，并在清理中收回131.52亿元逾期和呆滞贷款，同时对有风险的贷款加强了安全管理，还建立了非正常贷款的分类、登记、考核制度。目前清贷工作已近尾声，实施“集约经营计划”将进入调整信贷结构的阶段。
    据分析，目前农村信贷结构还不够合理，主要问题是农贷投入不足，农副产品收购等政策性贷款比例过大，资金来源不落实；工业企业低水平重复建设较多，三类企业和关停企业贷款所占比例过大；中长期农业贷款相对较少，非正常贷款占用比例过大。农业银行准备用两年时间，对农村信贷的产业结构、企业结构和资金结构进行全面调整，促使有限的信贷资金在不同产业、企业、产品之间合理配置，支持农村经济的协调发展。
    中国农业银行副行长戴相龙对记者说，从现在起到明年上半年，农行将从信贷资金结构的调整入手，集中进行逾期、呆滞贷款的收回工作，以此带动信贷产业结构和企业结构的调整。他强调，要建立收回逾期、呆滞贷款责任制，把收贷任务落实到各级行、各个部门、各个人，并重申：收回的到逾期贷款，上级行不调用，该支持的不扣减；对积极归还逾期、呆滞贷款的企业，在利息结算上，可以根据规定免罚、减收；对有钱不还的赖帐户，要选择典型进行起诉；委托银行以外组织和个人收回贷款的，可按规定付给手续费。
