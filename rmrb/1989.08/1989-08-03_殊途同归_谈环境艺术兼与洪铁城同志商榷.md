It seems to be a sense of social responsibility that drives the article "Only with the Environment, Can There Be Art," published on July 24 in the People's Daily, which expresses great concern over the deteriorating human living environment. The article suggests that we will enjoy genuine environmental art on the day when nature is protected and environmental pollution is controlled.

The sentiments expressed in the article are sincere. However, we are more inclined to accept the last sentence of the article – the combination of macro and micro perspectives. That is, while making every effort to solve the global environmental pollution problem, we should also promote environmental art rooted in people's daily lives.

As one architecture history teacher puts it, "Environmental art, in simple terms, is to beautify everything that people can see. From an entire country, an entire city, down to a toothpick, a piece of toilet paper." The article opposes environmental art and environmental protection (perhaps because both involve the word "environment," leading to a misunderstanding), which seems to be a case of "mistaking Zhang Fei for Li Kui."

Environmental pollution is a global issue. Whether it is the remote Antarctic or the outer space high above, there is no utopia. Here, we are still unclear: is it only in China that environmental art is not suitable, or does the whole world have to pass an environmental knowledge exam before engaging in environmental art?

The article blames environmental art for being the root of vulgar creations, which is quite unfair. One of the purposes of advocating environmental art is to widely establish environmental awareness in people's minds, to emphasize the environment in design and creation activities, to overcome the blind spots in environmental shaping, and to adapt to the environment. The appearance of things like "cranes and pandas" and "fake mountains and fountains" actually proves that environmental art indeed needs to be vigorously promoted.

Promoting environmental awareness is the core of environmental art. It is an expansion of human thinking and a higher demand for the quality of life. The research objects of environmental art have expanded from visual environments to auditory environments, tactile environments, olfactory environments, and so on, and have delved into psychological environments. It will continue to advance to a higher level.

Whether it is environmental governance or environmental art, both embody a beautiful dream of humanity, which is to perfect the world in which we live. Is it too demanding to ask people to realize each wish in an orderly manner?

    殊途同归
    ——谈环境艺术兼与洪铁城同志商榷
    杨莽华
    大概是社会责任感的驱使，载于7月24日《人民日报》的《唯有环境，才有艺术》一文，对人类生存环境的日益恶化表示了极大的忧虑。它提出的设想是：我们将在自然得到保护，环境污染得到治理的那个日子去享受真正环境艺术。
    《唯》文所表白的心情是非常诚恳的。然而我们更乐意接受《唯》文末尾的一句话——宏观与微观结合。即在对全球范围的环境污染问题极尽全力解决的同时，也把根植于人们生活的环境艺术搞起来。
    用一位建筑历史教师的话说：“所谓环境艺术，说明白了，就是把人们看得见的一切东西都美化起来。大到整片国土，整座城市，小到一根牙签，一张手纸。”《唯》文把这样一桩美化人们生活的事情与环境治理对立起来（或许因为二者都沾上“环境”二字，让人望文生义），未免有“关公战秦琼”之嫌。
    环境污染是全球性的问题。无论是远离人群的南极，还是高高在上的外层空间，都没有能成为世外桃源。这里，我们还不大清楚：究竟是只在中国不适合搞环境艺术呢，还是全世界都要等到环保知识考试及了格才能问津环境艺术。
    《唯》文把环境艺术指责为那些庸俗创作的祸根，着实让人感到委屈。因为倡导环境艺术的目的之一，就是要广泛地在人们心目中树立起环境意识，在设计和创作活动中绷上环境这根弦，以克服环境塑造中的盲目性，因环境而制宜。而“什么仙鹤熊猫”，“什么假山喷泉”之类的出现，恰恰证明环境艺术确实需要着力地宣扬。
    伸张环境意识是环境艺术的核心。它是对人的思维的进一步拓展，是人类对生活质量提出的更高要求。环境艺术的研究对象已经由视觉环境宽泛到了听觉环境、触觉环境、嗅觉环境等等，并向人的心理环境深入。它还将继续走向更高级的阶段。
    不管是治理环境还是环境艺术，同样寄托着人类一个美好的梦想，就是要完善自己生活的这个世界。叫人们都按部就班地依次去实现每一个愿望，是不是有些强人所难了吧。
