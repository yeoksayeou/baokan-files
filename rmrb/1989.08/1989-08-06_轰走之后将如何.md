Seeing the report in the People's Daily about "The Health Bureau of Longge County, Henan Province, sending away an inspection team that demanded meals and cigarettes" has invigorated my spirit. If more places could follow the example of Longge County's Health Bureau, those "public servants" who are used to eating and drinking at others' expense might restrain themselves a bit, and the "feast culture" might ease up a bit. This could save a considerable amount of money to do something for the people.

However, along with the joy comes a worry for Longge County. Based on past experience, sending them away is easy, but the trouble comes afterward.

One possibility is that the higher-ups might consider this a trivial matter, not pay attention to it, and let it pass. You send them away here, but they are welcomed elsewhere, and the guests continue to eat and drink as before. Another possibility is that this action might stir up a hornet's nest, with leaders blaming them for causing trouble, and the masses criticizing them for not knowing how to "suffer a small loss for a big gain, spend a few hundred to get tens of thousands." More seriously, they might offend the higher authorities, and in the future, it is possible that "no matter how much you achieve, no one will praise you, you will get less funding and supplies than others, and your leadership team will be adjusted earlier than others"—in short, you won't get any good results.

I hope this is just an unnecessary worry. People hope that the higher-level leaders will handle this seriously, stop the bad trend of eating and drinking, rectify the leadership style, and promote the improvement of party discipline. If it can be done this way, it will be an education for leaders at all levels and an encouragement for the people. "What happens after they are sent away?" I hope the reporters can do some follow-up reporting.

    轰走之后将如何
    王忠本
    看到《人民日报》刊登的“河南省长葛县卫生局轰走了顿顿讨酒喝要烟抽的上级验收组”的消息后，精神为之一振。如果都能像长葛县卫生局这样，那些白吃白喝惯了的“公仆”们可能会收敛一些，“吃喝风”可能会减轻一些，可以省出相当一部分钱来为老百姓谋点福利。
    但在高兴之余却又不免为长葛县担忧，按以往的经验，轰走容易，事后麻烦。
    一种可能是上级认为这是鸡毛蒜皮的小事，不予重视，不了了之。你这里轰走，他那里还欢迎，吃客们照吃不误。再一种可能是此举捅了马蜂窝，领导怪罪给他们抹了黑，群众埋怨他们不识时务，不懂得“吃小亏占大便宜，花几百元可换回几万”的要诀。更严重的是得罪了上级机关，今后很可能会“干出成绩也没人说好，批钱批物比别家少，调整班子比别家早”，反正让你没好果子吃。
    但愿这只是杞人忧天。人们希望，上级领导会进行严肃处理，刹住吃喝歪风，整顿领导作风，促进党风好转。若能如此，对各级领导是个教育，对人民是个鼓舞。“轰走之后将如何”，希望记者能搞点跟踪报道。
