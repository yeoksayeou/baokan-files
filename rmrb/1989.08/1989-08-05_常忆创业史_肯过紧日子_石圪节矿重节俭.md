Shiqiangjie Mine Emphasizes Thrift

The Shiqiangjie Coal Mine of the Shanxi Lu'an Mining Bureau has carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, transforming a small coal mine with an annual production of only a few dozen tons into a modern large-scale mine with an annual production of 150 million tons.

As early as the 1960s, Shiqiangjie Coal Mine was famous nationwide for its hard struggle and frugal management, and was commended by Premier Zhou Enlai.

Over the past 20 years, the mine has never relaxed its efforts in educating miners on hard struggle. The first lesson for new workers entering the mine is to recall the mine's history. Every year on August 18th, the anniversary of the mine's liberation, they invite "old frugal workers," "savings enthusiasts," and "junk kings" to give personal accounts. They have organized personnel to compile books such as "The History of Shiqiangjie Coal Mine" and "Heroes of the Mine," and have produced television news reports, feature films, and music videos about Shiqiangjie Coal Mine's hard struggle to build a modern mine.

The old tradition of hard struggle continues to be carried forward in the new era. All 30 teams in the mine have established repair points for waste materials, and each work group has set up a recycling library for waste materials. A single miner's lamp, with little "oil," has been the focus of the 30-plus managers in the lamp department, who have made significant savings. They painstakingly extract the tiny solder from used light bulbs and reuse it.

In the first half of this year, they recycled and reused over 3,000 items, saving more than 8,000 yuan. Last year, just from repairing and recycling, they saved nearly 2 million yuan for the state, and this year they have already saved over 1 million yuan.

    常忆创业史　肯过紧日子
    石圪节矿重节俭
    本报讯　山西潞安矿务局石圪节煤矿发扬艰苦奋斗精神，把一个年产只有十几万吨的小煤窑建设成为年产150万吨的现代化大型矿井。
    早在60年代，石圪节煤矿就以艰苦奋斗、勤俭办企业闻名全国，受到了周恩来总理的表彰。
    20多年来，这个矿始终没有放松对矿工进行艰苦奋斗的教育。
    新工人进矿第一课，就是回忆矿史。每年“八一八”矿山解放纪念日，都请“老勤俭”、“节约迷”、“破烂王”等进行现身说法教育。他们组织人员编写了《石圪节煤矿史》、《矿山英雄传》等书籍，拍摄了石圪节煤矿艰苦奋斗建设现代化矿井的电视新闻片、故事片、音乐片等。
    艰苦奋斗的老传统在新时期继续发扬。全矿30个科队都建立了废旧物资维修点，各班组建立了废旧材料回收库。一盏矿灯没有多少“油水”，可是矿灯班的30多名管理员硬是在这小小的矿灯上作出了节约的大文章。他们把废灯泡上米粒大小的焊锡一粒粒抠下来，重新利用。
    今年上半年，他们回收复用各种材料3000多件，节约8000多元。去年仅修旧利废点滴节约一项，就为国家节约近200万元，今年上半年又达到了100多万元。
