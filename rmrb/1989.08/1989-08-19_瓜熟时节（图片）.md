Title: The Season of Ripened Melons
Author: Zhao Shilin
Date: 1989-08-19
Edition: 5

The article "The Season of Ripened Melons" by Zhao Shilin, originally published in "Satire and Humor," discusses the metaphorical "season of ripened melons," which signifies a time of maturity and readiness. The piece likely delves into the societal or economic conditions of the time, using the imagery of melons ripening to convey a sense of things coming to fruition or reaching a critical point. Given the date of publication, the context would be the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent political and social climate in China. The article would reflect the author's perspective on the state of affairs, possibly with a blend of satire and humor to critique or comment on the prevailing circumstances.
