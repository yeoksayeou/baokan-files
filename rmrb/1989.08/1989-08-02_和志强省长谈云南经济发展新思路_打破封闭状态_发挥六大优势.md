The reform and opening-up policy has enabled Yunnan, a province on the country's border, to break free from its closed status, significantly enhancing its economic strength. Over the past decade, Yunnan's gross national product, total industrial and agricultural output, national income, and total export volume have all doubled. The social wealth, local fiscal revenue, and new fixed assets created are equivalent to the total of the 26 years before the reform and opening-up.

Governor He Zhiqiang recently discussed the economic development challenges facing Yunnan with reporters. He pointed out that the main difficulties include the inability to be self-sufficient in grain, the inability of the fiscal system to be self-sustaining, a low self-sufficiency rate for daily industrial products, and rapid population growth.

Based on Yunnan's actual situation, He Zhiqiang emphasized that Yunnan must firmly adhere to the policy of reform and opening-up, further break free from its closed status, and fully utilize its six major advantages. These advantages are:

1. Abundant hydropower resources: Yunnan has over 20 million kilowatts of hydropower resources that can be developed, but only about 4% have been developed so far.
2. Rich mineral resources: Yunnan's reserves of lead and tin are the highest in the country, and it has high-grade, shallowly buried phosphate deposits.
3. Significant production and processing of tobacco, sugar, and tea: Yunnan's production of these items ranks among the top in the country.
4. Unique tropical economic crops: Yunnan's development of coffee, rubber, and spices has made initial progress, with the potential to form industrial clusters.
5. Dense forests providing ample raw materials for timber processing: The timber processing industry has great potential.
6. Beautiful natural scenery and unique ethnic customs: These features make Yunnan's tourism industry distinctive, attracting approximately 100,000 tourists each year.

    和志强省长谈云南经济发展新思路
    打破封闭状态  发挥六大优势
    本报昆明8月2日电　新华社记者杜笑岩、本报记者王谨报道：改革开放使地处祖国边陲的云南省打破了封闭状态，经济实力有了明显增强。近10年来，云南省国民生产总值、工农业总产值、国民收入、外贸出口总额都实现了翻番，创造的社会财富、地方财政收入、新增固定资产相当于改革开放前26年的总和。
    云南省省长和志强最近向记者谈到该省经济发展存在的问题时说，粮食不能自给、财政不能自理、日用工业品自给率低、人口膨胀快，是云南经济发展面临的主要困难。根据云南省的实际情况，云南今后的经济发展必须坚定不移地执行改革开放的方针，进一步打破封闭，充分利用好自身的六大优势。这六大优势是：水力资源丰富，可供开发的水力资源达2000多万千瓦，目前已开发的还不足4％；矿产资源藏量大，铅、锡储量居全国首位，磷矿品位高，埋藏浅；烟、糖、茶的生产和加工颇具规模，产量居全国前列；热带经济作物得天独厚，咖啡、橡胶、香料的开发已取得初步进展，可望形成产业群体；茂密的森林为林产品加工提供了充足的原料，林产品加工业大有可为；优美的自然风光和独特的民族风情构成了云南旅游业的特色，现在每年有游客约10多万人。
