The issue of blood supply is becoming increasingly severe and has attracted the attention of various sectors of society. On July 22, the People's Daily published a special report titled "Citizens, Please Roll Up Your Sleeves" on page five. Here are some suggestions on how to encourage citizens to roll up their sleeves.

I believe that by mobilizing every citizen to store a certain amount of blood when they are healthy, the blood supply issue can be resolved. Specifically, this involves establishing a blood savings bank.

The blood savings bank would have multiple functions: First, it would handle blood transfusion services, including promoting and organizing the public to participate in blood savings, voluntary blood donation, and unpaid blood donation; managing blood sources, conducting unified blood collection, and supplying blood to ensure the need for blood. Second, it would have financial functions, converting the blood saved by people into funds, which, in addition to being used for self-development, would also be invested in national construction, similar to the savings business of financial banks.

It is suggested that the Ministry of Health establish a national blood savings bank headquarters, with branches in each province responsible for administrative and business leadership, formulating policies, regulations, and development plans for the blood transfusion industry. The central blood stations in each city would be transformed into blood savings centers based on their existing foundations, with several blood savings offices set up under them. These offices could be composed of existing hospital departments and staff with blood collection equipment.

This approach would help change people's traditional mindset of neither wanting to sell blood nor wanting to donate blood, balancing their psychology. Transitioning from selling blood and voluntary blood donation to paid blood savings, psychologically, it is a responsibility for oneself, which is generally acceptable to people and would be more effective than the administrative method of setting targets for citizens' voluntary blood donation.

Due to the need to pay blood donors a certain amount of nutritional fees, various types of blood sellers and blood tycoons, as well as various social problems, have emerged. Implementing paid blood savings not only allows savers to obtain higher economic benefits after a certain savings period but also eliminates the conditions for blood sellers, thereby eliminating illegal elements such as blood brokers and vampires in blood transactions, and ensuring the quality of blood.

The establishment of a blood savings bank would significantly improve economic benefits. Taking Shanghai as an example, based on the blood usage of 60 million milliliters in 1988 (paying 30 yuan in nutritional fees per 100 milliliters), the annual savings in nutritional fees alone would be 18 million yuan, and the economic accumulation over five years would reach 90 million yuan. If blood products processing and comprehensive blood utilization are carried out, the economic benefits would be even greater. These funds can not only be used to develop the blood transfusion industry but also be invested in society, forming a virtuous cycle and fundamentally changing the backward situation of China's blood transfusion industry.

    如何请公民伸出胳膊——
    建议开设血液储蓄银行
    血液问题日趋严重，已经引起社会各界的关注。人民日报在7月22日五版以《公民，请伸出你的胳膊》为题，发表了专题报道。现就如何请公民伸出胳膊提出浅见。
    我认为，动员每个公民在身体健康的时候，将定量的血液储存起来，以备自己要输血时使用，血源问题就可以解决。具体来说就是建立血液储蓄银行。
    血液储蓄银行有着多方面的职能：一是输血职能，负责宣传组织群众参加血液储蓄、公民义务献血和无偿献血；负责统一管理血源，统一采血，统一供血，保证用血需要；二是金融职能，将人们储蓄的血液在转变为资金之后，除用于自身建设外，还向社会投资用于国家建设，这相当于金融银行的储蓄业务职能。
    建议由卫生部设国家血液储蓄银行总行，各省设分行，负责行政领导和业务领导，制订政策法规以及输血事业发展规划。各市的中心血站在原来的基础上转为血液储蓄中心，下设若干血液储蓄所。储蓄所可由现有医院等部门的采血设备和人员组成。
    这样做，有助于改变人们既不愿卖血又不愿意献血的传统意识，平衡人们的心理。由卖血、义务献血转为有偿储血，从心理上讲，为自己责无旁贷，是人们普遍能够接受的，要比公民义务献血用行政手段下达指标的办法效果好。
    由于公民义务献血要付给献血者一定的营养费，由此才产生了形形色色的卖血者和血霸及种种社会问题。实行血液有偿储蓄，不仅使储血者在一定储期后获得较高的经济效益，还使卖血者失去卖血的条件，那么社会上在血液买卖中出现的掮客、吸血鬼等等不法之徒将不消自灭，同时血液的质量也有了可靠的保证。
    血液储蓄银行的成立，还将大幅度提高经济效益。以上海市为例，按1988年用血量6000万毫升计算（每百毫升支付30元营养费），一年仅节省营养费一项的经济收入为1800万元，5年的经济积累将达9000万元。如果进行血液制品加工和血液综合利用，经济效益会更大。这些资金不仅可以用于发展输血事业，还可以向社会投资，形成良性循环，彻底改变我国输血事业的落后局面。　傅俊来
