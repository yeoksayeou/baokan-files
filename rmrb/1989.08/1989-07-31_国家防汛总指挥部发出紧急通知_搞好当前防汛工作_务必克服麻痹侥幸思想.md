The State Flood Control Headquarters has issued an emergency notice to strengthen current flood control work and overcome complacency and gambling mentality.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) — The State Flood Control Headquarters issued an emergency notice today titled "On Strengthening Current Flood Control Work."

The notice states that since the beginning of the flood season this year, the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, the upper reaches of the Huai River, and the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River have all experienced floods. Nineteen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, including Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Sichuan, Hainan, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Qinghai, Yunnan, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, and Beijing, have experienced localized heavy rainfall and floods. Typhoons have made landfall four times. The frequent occurrence of localized heavy rainfall and floods has resulted in relatively severe flood disasters.

The notice points out that currently, China is in the peak flood season of late July to early August. All major rivers have the possibility of experiencing major floods, and localized heavy rainfall and floods may become more frequent. To do a good job in the current flood control and flood fighting work and to achieve an overall victory in this year's flood control and flood fighting, all localities must strengthen the weak links exposed in the previous stage, repair flood control projects damaged by floods, strengthen project maintenance, do a good job in flood control and dispatch, and strengthen the prevention of landslides, rockfalls, and collapses. It is necessary to strengthen leadership and firmly guard the flood control posts.

The notice concludes by saying that from the situation in the previous stage, complacency and gambling mentality remain the main problems in current flood control work. Leaders of governments and flood control command departments at all levels must educate the broad masses of cadres and the people to establish the idea of preventing major floods, eliminating major waterlogging, and resisting major disasters, and truly implement the flood control policy of "safety first, prevention first, and prevention over rescue" to the grassroots level.

    国家防汛总指挥部发出紧急通知
    搞好当前防汛工作
    务必克服麻痹侥幸思想
    本报北京七月三十一日讯　记者从国家防汛总指挥部办公室获悉：国家防汛总指挥部今天发出《关于搞好当前防汛工作的紧急通知》。
    通知说，今年入汛以来，黄河上、中游，淮河上游，长江上、中游，先后出现过洪水。湖南、江西、安徽、江苏、湖北、河南、四川、海南、广西、福建、浙江、青海、云南、黑龙江、内蒙古、吉林、辽宁、河北、北京等十九个省、自治区、直辖市发生过局部暴雨洪水。台风已有四次登陆。局部暴雨洪水的频繁发生，造成了较为严重的洪涝灾害。
    通知指出：当前，我国正处在七月下旬八月上旬的主汛期，各大江河都有发生大洪水的可能性，各地的局部暴雨洪水也可能更为频繁。为做好当前的防汛抗洪工作，夺取今年防汛抗洪的全面胜利，各地要加强前阶段暴露出的薄弱环节，修复被洪水冲毁的防洪工程，加强工程维护，搞好洪水调度，加强泥石流、岩崩、滑坡等灾害的预防，切实加强领导，坚守防汛岗位。
    通知最后说，从前一阶段的情况看，麻痹侥幸思想仍然是当前防汛存在的主要问题。各级政府和防汛指挥部门的领导要教育广大干部群众树立防大汛、除大涝、抗大灾的思想，真正把“安全第一、以防为主、防重于抢”的防汛方针落实到基层。
