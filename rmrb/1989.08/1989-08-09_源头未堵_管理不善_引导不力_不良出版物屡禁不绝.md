Mid-July, Shanghai conducted a major cleanup of both public and underground cultural markets, seizing and destroying a large number of illegal publications and obscene books and videotapes. The results were gratifying, but also thought-provoking: why do harmful publications persist despite repeated bans?

According to statistics from Shanghai's public security department, in 1985, during a large-scale "anti-pornography" campaign, over 15,000 items of obscene materials were seized. However, by 1987, this number had surged to over 170,000 items, and in 1988, it further increased to over 260,000 items. This year, in just the first half of the year, over 300,000 items were seized. Year after year, the "yellow tide" continues to spread exponentially. Relevant departments believe there are reasons behind this.

First, the vast majority of obscene publications originate from the coastal areas of Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. Despite Shanghai's efforts to set up multiple checkpoints at sea, land, and air entry points, it is still difficult to completely block these materials. Some publishers, under the guise of cooperative publishing, sell publishing permits, giving the green light to publications with low taste and unhealthy content. Some even use underground distribution channels. Relevant department officials unanimously agree that to effectively control harmful publications, the source must first be blocked, creating a good overall environment.

Second, the profit from selling obscene materials is very high. A single videotape can yield a profit of forty to fifty yuan. In contrast, the penalties for such socially harmful behavior are relatively light. The criminal law stipulates a maximum sentence of only three years' imprisonment, and administrative penalties usually only amount to a fine of two to three hundred yuan, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the profits made by sellers. This objectively provides an opportunity for harmful publications to thrive. Relevant departments believe that by controlling the source of harmful publications and strengthening management through improved legal measures, it is possible to reduce harmful publications to the lowest level.

Third, there is a lack of necessary guidance and direction for the growing cultural needs of the masses. Currently, Shanghai residents own about 100,000 VCRs. The shortage of film sources and high rental prices have allowed some harmful audio-visual products to infiltrate families. It is necessary to strengthen the publication of healthy and rich books and audio-visual materials.

### 源头未堵　管理不善　引导不力  不良出版物屡禁不绝

    源头未堵　管理不善　引导不力
    不良出版物屡禁不绝
    7月中旬，上海对公开和“地下”的文化市场进行了一次大清扫，收缴和销毁了一大批非法出版物和淫秽书刊、录像带。成果是喜人的，但又令人深思：不良出版物为何屡禁不绝？
    据上海公安部门统计，1985年大规模“扫黄”，查获的各种淫秽物品达15000多件。然而，到了1987年猛增至17多万件，去年继续上升为26万多件，今年上半年便查获了30多万件。年年“扫黄”，但“黄色浊流”却仍然呈几何级数泛滥。有关部门认为事出有因。
    一、绝大多数淫秽出版物来自福建、广东和浙江沿海。尽管上海有关部门在进入上海的海陆空各个关卡层层设防，然终难堵绝。而一些出版社又以协作出版为名，出卖书号，为格调低下、内容不健康的出版物开了绿灯。有的甚至利用地下发行渠道搞发行。有关部门的同志一致认为，查禁不良出版物，必须首先截源，创造一个良好的大环境。
    二、贩卖淫秽物品获利很高。一盘录像带至少可获利四五十元。相反，对这种危害社会行为的处罚却相对偏轻。刑法上规定最高只能判三年徒刑，而治安处罚一般也仅罚款二三百元，与贩卖者获取的暴利相比，其实是九牛一毛，不足以有震慑作用。客观上给不良出版物有了可趁之机。有关部门认为，控制了不良出版物的源，再加上完善法制，加强管理，就有可能把不良出版物减少到最低限度。
    三、对日益增长的群众文化需求，缺乏必要的疏导和引导工作。目前上海市民的录像机拥有量已达10万台左右。片源缺乏，租片价高，使一部分不良音像制品得以趁机打进一些家庭。应该加强健康而丰富的书刊音像出版工作。
