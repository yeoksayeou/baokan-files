The State Council's Leading Group Office for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas recently issued a notice recommending the practice of "providing money, providing goods, and building a strong party branch" from the poverty alleviation efforts in Shandong's Linyi region to poverty-stricken areas across the country. The notice emphasized that strengthening grassroots party organizations is a fundamental experience and crucial guarantee for poverty alleviation work.

The notice forwarded a report from the Linyi Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province titled "Treating the Strengthening of Party Branches in Poor Villages as the Key to Poverty Alleviation and Prosperity." It pointed out that the battle to achieve the goal set by the State Council of solving the basic living needs of the majority of people in poverty-stricken areas during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period has been fully launched across the country. The key to completing this task lies in strengthening grassroots construction and fully leveraging the role of party branches as fortresses and the exemplary role of party members in poverty alleviation and relief.

It is understood that among the 18 key poverty-stricken areas identified by the state, the poverty alleviation work in the Yimeng Mountain area has been relatively outstanding. This region had over 900,000 impoverished households in 1984, which decreased to 180,000 households by the end of last year, with 79.5% of households having escaped poverty. The reason Linyi region was able to quickly solve the basic living needs of a large number of farmers is that the Linyi Regional Committee has insisted on the principle of "providing money and goods, but also building a strong party branch" in recent years. Why have some villages remained in poverty for a long time? Several years ago, the Regional Committee discovered through investigations and analyses that the common reason was weak party branch leadership. Xiaoniu Village in Fei County and Linruizhuang Village in Pingyi County were once deeply impoverished mountain villages. Due to the selection of good party branches, these villages escaped poverty in just a few years and became wealthy villages with an average household income of over 10,000 yuan. However, in some villages, despite receiving adequate funds and supplies, the party branches were weak and ineffective, resulting in persistent poverty year after year. The facts made the leaders of the Regional Committee realize that the saying "It's better to have a poor table than a poor team" is very true.

In the process of building strong party branches, they insisted on combining ideological rectification with organizational rectification. While boldly promoting outstanding party members, they also appropriately arranged for the retirement of older comrades from the leadership. Over the years, they have adjusted 7,232 village-level party branches, accounting for 57% of the total, and selected over 7,500 outstanding party members to join the leadership. This has increased the number of well-organized, cohesive, and highly respected party branches from 26% in 1984 to 75% now, while reducing the number of weak, disorganized, and low-respect party branches from 42% to 3%. Currently, 95% of rural party branches in the region have relatively stable party internal systems, with 70% maintaining good practices, an increase of 45% compared to the past. They have also established party schools in most townships across the region to rotate the training of grassroots party members and reserve cadres, with a focus on training party members and cadres in poor villages to improve their political and professional skills.

The construction of grassroots party organizations has effectively guaranteed and promoted the implementation of poverty alleviation work. The region has established a set of poverty alleviation responsibility systems, forming an effective poverty alleviation leadership and management system from top to bottom. This ensures that the central government's poverty alleviation measures and spirit can be effectively implemented at the household level.

    山东临沂地区扶贫经验：给钱给物更要建设好支部
    国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组要求推广
    本报讯　国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组办公室近日发出通知，向全国贫困地区推荐山东临沂地区扶贫实践中的“给钱、给物、更要建设一个好支部”的做法，指出加强基层党组织建设是扶贫工作的一项根本性经验和重要保证。
    通知转发了中共山东省临沂地委的“把加强贫困村党支部建设作为脱贫致富的关键来抓”的报告。指出：以实现国务院提出的“七五”期间解决大多数贫困地区人民温饱问题为目标的攻坚战已在各地全面展开。完成这项任务的关键，就在于加强基层建设，充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用和党员扶贫济困的模范作用。
    据了解，在国家重点扶持的全国18片集中连片的贫困地区中，沂蒙山区的扶贫工作成绩比较突出。这个地区1984年原有90多万贫困户，到去年年底已减少到18万户，有79.5％的户脱贫了。临沂地区之所以能较快地解决大面积的农民温饱问题，原因就是临沂地委近几年坚持了“给钱给物，更要建设一个好支部”的原则。为什么一些村庄长期贫困？前几年地委通过调查分析发现，这原因，那原因，一个共同原因是党支部领导班子弱。费县的下牛田村、平邑县的林瑞庄，过去都是穷得叮当响的深山村，由于各自选出一个好支部，短短几年摆脱贫困，成为户均收入超万元的富村。而有的村，钱没少拨，物没少给，由于支部涣散，无所作为，年复一年，贫困依旧。事实使地委的领导同志认识到，群众说的“不怕有个穷摊子，就怕没个好班子”是很有道理的。
    在建设好支部的工作中，他们坚持思想整顿与组织整顿相结合的办法，在大胆启用优秀党员的同时，妥善安置退出班子的老同志。几年来先后调整了7232个村级党支部，占支部总数的57％，选拔了7500多名优秀党员进入领导班子，使组织健全、班子团结、群众威信较高的支部由1984年的26％提高到现在的75％，而软弱涣散、威信不高的3类支部由42％下降到3％。目前全区95％的农村党支部比较稳定地建立了党内各项制度，其中坚持较好的占70％，比过去提高了45％，他们还在全区大多乡镇办起党校，轮流培训基层党员干部和后备干部，其中重点是抓贫困村党员干部的培训，以提高这些干部的政治与业务素质。
    基层党组织的建设，有效地保障和促进了扶贫工作的开展。全区普遍建立了一套扶贫工作责任制度，上下形成了一个有效的扶贫领导管理体系，使中央的扶贫措施和精神能有效地落实到户。
