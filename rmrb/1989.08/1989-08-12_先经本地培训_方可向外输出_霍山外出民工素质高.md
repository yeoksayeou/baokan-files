Heshang County, located in the Dabie Mountains of western Anhui, has adopted the approach of "training first, then exporting" to enhance the quality of its labor export personnel, which has been well-received by employers.

Heshang County has over 40,000 surplus rural laborers. As the state reduces the scale of construction projects, the county's labor export work has faced difficulties.

Through investigations in major cities, they discovered that purely physical labor is no longer in demand, while farmers with technical skills and a combination of intelligence and physical strength have become the preferred choice for employers in other regions. Therefore, Heshang County established the guiding principle of "selecting educated youth, providing local training before exporting, and bringing back technology to contribute to the hometown in the future" and implemented it. It was stipulated that anyone from the county who wishes to go out to work must have at least a junior high school education and undergo systematic professional training before the county labor service company can assist in finding employment.

Currently, the county has trained 2,180 people, who have been sent to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, as well as Jiangsu, Shandong, and Guangdong provinces.

It is understood that this approach of training first and then exporting has made the rural labor force highly sought after by employers. In the second half of last year, 44 rural youths sent to the Shanghai Yuhua Glass Factory completed their apprenticeship two months ahead of schedule due to their strong foundation and quick learning ability, and were able to start working directly on the production line.

### 先经本地培训　方可向外输出  霍山外出民工素质高

    先经本地培训　方可向外输出
    霍山外出民工素质高
    据新华社合肥8月12日电（通讯员罗瑞雪、许建华）地处皖西大别山区的霍山县采取“先培训、后输出”的办法，提高劳务输出人员的素质，受到用人单位的欢迎。
    霍山县农村剩余劳力超过4万人。随着国家压缩基建规模，这个县的劳务输出工作遇到困难。
    通过到大城市调查，他们发现，单纯体力型劳力已不再受欢迎，而具有技术素质、智力与体力兼备型农民，成了外地争先接受的对象。于是，霍山县确立了“挑选有文化的知识青年，先在本地培训后再予以输出，将来带技术回家乡作贡献”的指导思想并付诸实施。规定凡本县要求外出人员，必须具备初中以上文化程度，接受系统的专业培训，才能由县劳动服务公司帮助联系工作。
    现在，这个县已有2180人接受了培训，被先后输送到京、津、沪以及江苏、山东、广东等省市。
    据了解，这种先培训、后输出的办法，使外出的农村劳力备受用人单位的青睐。去年下半年被送至上海耀华玻璃厂的44名农村青年，由于基础好，接受能力强，提前两个月结束实习期，进入直接操作岗位。
