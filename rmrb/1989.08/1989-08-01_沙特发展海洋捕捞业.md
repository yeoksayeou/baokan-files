Saudi Arabia is renowned as the "Kingdom of Oil," but it is striving to diversify its economy. To meet the growing demand for seafood among its people, the Saudi government is actively investing in and developing the fisheries industry. In just a few years, Saudi Arabia's marine fisheries have developed rapidly and are now among the world's leading industries.

To fully utilize the fisheries resources of the Gulf and the Red Sea and enrich the domestic seafood market, the Saudi government invested one billion riyals in 1981 to establish the Saudi Fisheries Company. Since its establishment, despite the significant capital expenditure on ongoing construction projects, the company has achieved high profits. For example, in 1987, the company achieved sales of 1.579 billion riyals, with profits reaching 29 million riyals. The company's total assets have reached 2.398 billion riyals. From 1982 to 1987, the company's catch increased by 250%, processing increased by 300%, and sales volume increased by 275%. The Saudi Fisheries Company can now supply 66 categories and 115 varieties of seafood products tailored to customer needs, fully meeting local market demand and exporting large quantities of fresh fish to countries like the UK and the US daily.

In March 1981, shortly after the establishment of the Saudi Fisheries Company, a cold storage plant with a daily capacity of 30 tons of fish and a sales point were built. Initially, the company relied on a single leased fishing vessel operating in the Gulf. In September of the same year, the company began fishing operations in the Red Sea using Jizan as a base. By 1982, the company had four trawlers for shrimp fishing, and by 1983, it had added two more. To diversify seafood products and meet the growing demand, the company not only operates its own fishing vessels but also encourages local individual fishermen to actively participate in fishing. The company purchases large quantities of seafood products from individual fishermen in the Red Sea and Gulf regions. With the rapid development of the fishing industry, the company expanded its cold storage facilities in Dimam and Jizan and built a third large cold storage facility. To adapt to the growing sales of fisheries products, in 1984, the company established two large wholesale centers in Riyadh and Jeddah. At the same time, the company continued to expand its fisheries processing and storage capabilities. In 1986, the company acquired three more shrimp fishing vessels. Recently, the company operates 46 fishing vessels in the Gulf and the Red Sea, with 20 of them owned by the company. The Saudi Fisheries Company is currently further developing its fishing operations in the Gulf, preparing to expand its fleet and increase the number of modern fishing vessels.

    沙特发展海洋捕捞业
    本报记者　吕志星
    沙特阿拉伯以“石油王国”著称，但它努力使经济多样化。为了丰富人民对水产食品的需要，沙特政府注意积极投资和发展渔业生产。短短的几年，沙特海洋捕捞业发展迅速，现已进入先进行列。
    为充分利用海湾和红海渔业资源，丰富国内水产品市场，沙特政府在一九八一年投资一亿里亚尔建起了沙特渔业公司。渔业公司自建立以来，尽管不断上马的基建工程耗费了大量的资金，可还是实现了高利润。以一九八七年为例，在一点五七九亿里亚尔的销售额中就获利润达二千九百万里亚尔，公司总资产已达二点三九八亿里亚尔。一九八二年至一九八七年，公司捕获量增长百分之二百五十，加工处理增长百分之三百，销售量增长百分之二百七十五。沙特渔业公司现能出售适合顾客需要的六十六类一百一十五种水产食品，不仅能充分满足当地市场的需要，而且每天还可以向英、美等国出口大量的鲜鱼。
    一九八一年三月，沙特渔业公司成立不久就建起了一座日产三十吨鱼的冷冻厂和一个销售点，当时仅靠租赁的一条捕鱼船在海湾作业。同年九月以季赞为基地开始在红海进行捕捞作业。一九八二年公司已有四艘拖网捕虾船，一九八三年又添置了两艘。为使水产食品多样化，不断满足人们的需要，公司除经营船只捕捞外，还注意发挥地方个体捕捞的积极性，在红海和海湾地区大量收购地方个体捕捞的水产品。随着捕捞业的迅速发展，公司扩建了在迪玛姆和季赞的冷库，同时又新建了公司的第三座大冷库。为了适应渔业销售的发展，一九八四年公司在利雅得和吉达建立了两个大的批发中心。与此同时，公司还不断扩大渔业加工和储藏业的发展。一九八六年，公司又购进了三艘捕虾船。最近，在海湾和红海中由公司经营的作业捕捞船只已达四十六艘，其中属于公司自己购置的达二十艘。沙特渔业公司目前正在进一步努力发展其海湾的捕捞作业，准备继续扩大船队，增加现代化捕捞船只。
