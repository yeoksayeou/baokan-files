The state-owned Qinchuang Machinery Plant in Xi'an has prioritized and strengthened its ideological and political work, mobilizing the enthusiasm of all its employees. This year, the plant was named an exemplary enterprise for ideological and political work in Shaanxi Province.

The plant is a key military-industrial enterprise under the Northern (Group) Corporation of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electronic Industry, with nearly 10,000 employees. Over the past few years, the plant's leadership has focused on three areas to strengthen and improve ideological and political work, enhancing the sense of responsibility among the workers:

First, the plant has reinforced and stabilized a core team of administrative cadres and Party and Youth League members for ideological work. Last year, the plant established a Thought and Political Work Research Association, chaired by the plant director and Party secretary, which regularly analyzes the ideological state of all employees and sets the focus for ideological education for each period. The plant has also strengthened its team of political workers, establishing 18 sub-plant Party committees and appointing full-time secretaries, and assigning full-time political workers to workshops with over 100 employees.

Second, the plant has conducted ideological and political work around the central tasks of production and operations. Since last year, the plant leadership has held multiple dialogues with employees, fully explaining each reform measure and major operational decision to the broad masses of employees to seek their understanding and support, and addressing ideological issues with targeted work. In March of this year, the plant decided to develop new civilian products, but faced difficulties with capital turnover. After learning the situation, employees raised 65 million yuan in risk collateral within a month, ensuring the timely production of new products. Over the past year, more than 2,000 employees have proposed over 1,700 suggestions for technological innovations and other initiatives, generating 40 million yuan in benefits.

Third, the plant has combined ideological work with solving practical problems. The plant's leadership does not engage in "empty talk" or "empty promises" in ideological work but instead combines solving ideological issues with addressing practical difficulties. Many employees faced challenges with childcare, so at the beginning of this year, the plant used funds from compressing the renovation of a hotel and other projects to build a new kindergarten accommodating nearly 1,000 children, easing the employees' concerns.

Solid ideological work has yielded good social and economic results. Despite facing difficulties such as power outages, capital shortages, reduced military product orders, and the disruption of unrest in Xi'an, all employees of the plant have persisted in production, developed civilian products, and completed the state-assigned export and domestic sales tasks on time, achieving a "double over half" in industrial output value and profits for the first half of the year.

    秦川机械厂不搞“空对空”  加强思想政治工作见实效
    本报讯　西安国营秦川机械厂，重视和加强思想政治工作，调动全厂职工的积极性。今年这个厂被评为陕西省思想政治工作优秀企业。
    这个厂是机械电子工业部北方（集团）总公司下属的、有近万名职工的大型军工骨干企业。几年来，厂领导从三个方面着手，加强和做好思想政治工作，增强工人主人翁责任感：
    一是充实和稳定以行政干部、党团员为骨干的政工队伍。厂里去年成立了以厂长、党委书记为会长的厂思想政治工作研究会，定期分析全厂职工的思想状况，提出每个时期思想教育的重点。这个厂还充实政工干部队伍，成立了18个分厂党委，配备专职书记，百人以上大车间都配备了专职政工干部。
    二是围绕生产经营中心，开展思想政治工作。去年以来，厂领导多次与职工进行对话，将厂里每项改革措施、重大经营决策，原原本本交给广大职工，以求得职工的理解和支持，并针对思想问题，有的放矢地做工作。今年3月，厂里决定开发新民品，但资金周转有困难。职工们了解情况后，一个月就筹集风险抵押金650万元，使新产品按期投产。一年来，全厂有2000余名职工提出技术革新项目等建议1700余条，创效益400万元。
    三是把思想工作同解决实际问题结合起来。这个厂领导做思想工作，不搞“空对空”，不搞“空许愿”，而是把解决思想问题和实际困难结合起来。不少职工的小孩入托难，今年初，厂里用压缩改建宾馆等项目投资，新建一个容纳近千名儿童的幼儿园，解除了职工的后顾之忧。
    扎实的思想工作，收到了良好的社会效果和经济效益。今年上半年，在遇到停电、资金短缺、军品任务下降等困难和西安地区动乱干扰的情况下，全厂职工坚持生产，开发民品，按期完成了国家下达的外贸、内销任务，实现了工业总产值、利润“双过半”。
