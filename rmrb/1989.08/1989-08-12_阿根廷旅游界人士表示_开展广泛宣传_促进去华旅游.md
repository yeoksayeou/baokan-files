Traveling to China is a dream that excites people. China, with its ancient civilization and diverse natural landscapes, has a great appeal to tourists. The key is to strengthen publicity efforts. This was the main topic of discussion at a film screening reception held by Chinese Ambassador to Argentina Li Guoxin for local tourism officials this evening.

Ambassador Li Guoxin briefed the several hundred Argentine tourism officials attending the reception on the current situation of China's tourism industry and requested their assistance in revitalizing China's international tourism sector.

The general manager of a company that has been organizing trips to China for 18 years told a reporter that recently, due to the events in Beijing, people are unclear about the domestic situation in China, causing many tourists heading to the Far East to avoid China, which is regrettable. The company has decided to immediately launch a comprehensive publicity campaign, using newspapers, radio, and television to introduce China, dispel people's doubts, and promote travel to China.

Argentina is one of the Latin American countries with a relatively high number of tourists visiting China. Although the national economic situation is not good, the number of people traveling abroad remains substantial.

    阿根廷旅游界人士表示
    开展广泛宣传　促进去华旅游
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯8月11日电　记者李志明报道：去中国旅游是令人神往、激动人心的事情。中国以其古老的文明和丰富多姿的自然景观对旅游者具有巨大的吸引力，关键是要加强宣传工作。这是今天晚上在中国驻阿根廷大使李国新为当地旅游界人士举行的电影招待会上人们谈论的主题。
    李国新大使向出席招待会的数百位阿根廷旅游界人士介绍了中国旅游业的近况，请他们协助振兴中国的国际旅游事业。
    18年前就开始组织去中国旅游的一家公司总经理对记者说，最近，由于北京发生的事件，人们对中国国内局势不明了，使得许多去远东旅游的人都回避去中国，这是令人遗憾的。他们公司决定立即开展广泛的宣传运动，通过报纸、广播、电视介绍中国，打消人们的疑虑，推动去中国的旅游。
    阿根廷是拉美国家中去中国旅游人数较多的国家，虽然国家经济形势不太好，但出国旅游的人仍保持相当的数量。
