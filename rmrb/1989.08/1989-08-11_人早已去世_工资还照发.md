Title: Salary Still Paid After Death

    A certain individual I know, originally worked in a unit in another province. After retiring, he moved back to his hometown with his family. Unfortunately, he passed away in late February of last year.

    According to logic, his family should have reported his death to his former workplace. However, they did not do so and continued to receive his retirement pension on schedule. The unit where the deceased worked also never inquired about his health or living situation. No wonder people are saying, "The person has been dead for a year, but the bureaucrats are still sending money." Who knows how long this situation will continue?

    I believe this is a loophole in the national budget. The relevant departments should pay attention to the health of retired personnel who have returned to their hometowns and maintain regular contact. They should not just send the retirement pension and then ignore everything else.

    人早已去世  工资还照发
    我认识的某君，原在外省一单位工作。退休后，他携眷回原籍定居，不幸于去年2月下旬去世。
    按理，他的家属应该如实向老人原工作单位报告，可是他们没有这样做，继续按期收到这位老人的退休金。而去世老人的所在单位也从未了解过老人的身体和生活情况。难怪人们议论说：“人已去世一周年，单位官僚仍寄钱。”这种情况不知要持续到何年何月？
  我认为，这是国家经费开支上的一个漏洞。有关部门对本单位回原籍定居的离退休人员的健康状况要关心，应定期联系，不能只顾汇出离退休金，就什么都不管了。
