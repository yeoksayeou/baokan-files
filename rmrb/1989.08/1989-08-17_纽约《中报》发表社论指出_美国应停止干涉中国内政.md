New York's *Zhongbao* today published an editorial stating that the current deadlock in Sino-American relations is due to the fact that American officials and the public have yet to acknowledge that the U.S. has been interfering in China's internal affairs.

The editorial, titled "The Deadlock in Sino-American Relations Must Be Resolved Soon," states, "Since China suppressed the Beijing riots, American media have spread rumors, causing anti-China sentiment to rise in the U.S. government and among the public. Additionally, the Fang Lizhi couple have sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy, creating an abnormal state in Sino-American relations that has lasted for two months without any signs of improvement." The editorial believes that this is because American officials and the public have yet to acknowledge the fact that the U.S. has been interfering in China's internal affairs, nor have they understood or valued the Chinese people's determination to safeguard their country's independence. This is the crux of the current deadlock in Sino-American relations, and until this deadlock is resolved, normal relations between the two countries cannot be restored.

The editorial says, "Some people, when reviewing the history of 40 years ago, say that if the People's Liberation Army had negotiated with the then-U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, after occupying Nanjing in April 1949, perhaps the U.S. would have changed its mind and might have recognized the People's Republic of China when it was proclaimed on October 1 of that year. These people believe that was a turning point in Sino-American relations. In reality, that was an illusion and an incorrect judgment. They perhaps have not carefully read the 'White Paper' and the letter to President Truman by then U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, who wrote: 'China's ancient civilization and its democratic individualism will eventually reappear, and China will finally shake off foreign shackles. I believe that all developments toward this goal, both present and future, should be encouraged.'"

The editorial continues, "Forty years have passed in the blink of an eye. The Chinese people have written a monumental chapter in modern history, despite having taken some detours and dead ends. However, the fact that 'the Chinese people have stood up' is indisputable. Yet, to this day, Acheson's ghost lingers, encouraging 'democratic individualism to reappear.' But that was merely a fleeting moment. Acheson's ghost did not even have time to laugh before being dispersed by the righteous indignation of the Chinese people. Those American schadenfreude enthusiasts who were still babies when Acheson issued the 'White Paper' were unable to finish shouting 'It's coming! It's coming!' before suddenly falling silent. Thus, from disappointment to anger, they shouted 'impose sanctions on China,' but they could not intimidate the Chinese people. And so, the Fang Lizhi couple continue to live in the U.S. Embassy, enjoying a life of 'abundant fish.' The two countries remain at an impasse, and the deadlock cannot be resolved."

The editorial emphasizes, "'The one who tied the bell must be the one to untie it.' American officials and the public should face reality. The deadlock will have to be resolved one day, and it is better to resolve it sooner rather than later. After it is resolved, it will benefit both sides, and objectively speaking, the U.S. will benefit the most. Jiang Zemin's words to the British authorities and Hong Kong people, 'You take the main road, I take the narrow path,' we believe, also apply to the U.S. Specifically, the Chinese people have decided to walk the socialist path, and the U.S. should walk its own capitalist path!"

The editorial concludes, "People have dignity, and countries have national pride. President Bush lived in China for a period of time and must understand the philosophy behind the phrase 'one can be killed but not humiliated.' Today, the Chinese people are fighting for the national pride that their internal affairs are not subject to foreign interference. If this national pride is insulted and damaged, it is equivalent to overturning the phrase 'the Chinese people have stood up,' which stands tall and proud. The blood shed by tens of millions of soldiers and civilians for the establishment of New China would have been in vain. How can China stand independently in the world? This is purely a matter of principle."

### 纽约《中报》发表社论指出  美国应停止干涉中国内政

    纽约《中报》发表社论指出
    美国应停止干涉中国内政
    本报纽约8月15日电　纽约《中报》今天发表社论，指出目前中美关系未能恢复正常化的死结是美国朝野人士始终不承认美国干涉中国内政的事实。
    这篇题为《中美关系正常化的死结必须及早解开》的社论说，“自从中国平息北京暴乱以来，由于美国新闻媒介散播谣言，以致美国朝野掀起反华鼓噪浪潮，加以方励之夫妇投靠于美国人膝下，以美国大使馆为庇护所，形成中美关系不正常的状态，为时已达两月，情况迄未好转。”社论认为，这是因为美国朝野人士始终不承认美国干涉中国内政的事实，也始终不理解和不重视中国人民坚决维护国家独立地位的精神和意志，这便是当前中美关系的一个死结，这一死结一日不解，两国正常关系便一日不能恢复。
    社论说，“有人在回顾40年前的历史时，说什么中国人民解放军于1949年4月攻占南京后，如果和当时的美国驻华大使司徒雷登打交道，透过斡旋，或许其时美国会回心转意，说不定在同年10月1日北京宣布中华人民共和国时会予以承认，这些人认为那是中美关系的一个转折点。其实那是一种幻想和不正确的论断，他们或许没有细心读一读当时美国国务卿艾奇逊所发表的‘白皮书’及致杜鲁门总统的信，艾奇逊这样写道：‘中国悠久的文明和他的民主个人主义终于会再显身手，中国终于会摆脱外国的羁绊。对于中国目前和将来一切朝着这个目标的发展，我认为应当得到鼓励。’”
    社论接着说，“40年转眼已经流逝，中国人民已经写下了近代史上惊天动地的史篇，尽管也走过一些弯路和死胡同，但是‘中国人民站起来了’的事实却是无法推翻的。然而时至今日，艾奇逊的阴魂不散、鬼影魑魅，的确‘鼓励’了‘民主个人主义再显身手’，可是那只是昙花一现而已，艾奇逊的阴魂还来不及裂口大笑便随即被中国人民的浩然正气冲散得一干二净，那些在艾奇逊发表‘白皮书’时还是娃娃的美国幸灾乐祸之辈，‘来了！来了！’之声还未唤完时，忽然唤不下去了，于是由失望而恼羞成怒，叫嚣‘实行对华制裁’，可是却吓不倒中国人，而方励之夫妇便也继续在美国大使馆过‘食有鱼’的日子，两国相持不下，死结不能解开。”
    社论强调，“‘解铃还得系铃人’，美国朝野人士应该面对现实，死结总有一天要解开的，慢解不若早解，解了以后对双方均有利，而且平情而论，解了以后，大利则在美国。江泽民对港英当局和香港人士所说的‘你走你的阳关道，我走我的独木桥’，我们认为也适应于美国的。具体言之，中国人民走社会主义道路是走定了的，美国还是自己走资本主义的路吧！”
    社论最后说：“人有人格，国有国格，布什总统在中国住了一段时间，必然懂得中国人‘士可杀而不可辱’这句话的哲理吧，今天中国人民争的是中国内政不容外国干涉的国格，如果这一国格遭受污辱及损害，便等于推翻‘中国人民站起来了’那句顶天立地的名言，为建立新中国而牺牲的数千万军民的鲜血便等于白流，中国何以能以独立自主的姿态屹立于世？这完全是一个原则的问题。”
