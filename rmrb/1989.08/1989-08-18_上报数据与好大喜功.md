Recently, I participated in an inspection of the enforcement of the "Statistics Law." In one factory, the actual production value was only 900,000 yuan, but the reported production value was over 3,000,000 yuan. Some planning departments and supervisory departments, fearing that smaller statistical figures might be criticized by higher authorities, disregard the actual situation of the relevant enterprises. They calculate a growth figure based on a certain percentage and then report it, deceiving bureaucratic officials. Some enterprises report the production value as the amount of the plan assigned by higher authorities. To complete the production value plan, some enterprises double-count the production value, and even include other types of income as production value.

Why does this situation occur? The main reason is that some leaders have a tendency to seek grand achievements. Higher authorities often judge the production situation of an enterprise and the performance of its cadres based solely on the numbers reported from below, without investigating the actual situation.

Economic data is the basic basis for higher-level decision-making departments to analyze the situation and formulate policies, and it cannot be falsified or exaggerated.

    上报数据与好大喜功
    前不久，我参加了《统计法》执行情况的抽查。有个厂产值仅90万元，可上报产值300多万元。一些计划部门和主管部门怕有些统计的数字小了被上级责难，便不顾有关企业的实际情况，按照一定的百分比计算出一个增长数，然后上报，糊弄官僚主义。有的企业，上级下达多少计划就报多少产值。为了完成产值计划任务，有的企业重复计算产值，甚至把其它各种收入也算作产值。
    为什么会出现这种状况呢？主要是有些领导人好大喜功。上级部门看一个企业生产情况的好坏，干部工作的好坏，往往只看下面报来的数字，而不去了解实际情况。
    经济数据是上级决策部门分析形势、制定政策的基本依据，来不得掺假和虚报。
