Chinese female athlete Hou Xue Mei won the gold medal in the discus event at the World University Games on the evening of August 28.

According to Coach Bai Lin, female discus athlete Hou Xue Mei used to be very afraid of bad weather. Whenever she encountered wind or rain, she would mutter, "It's over, it's over." However, yesterday she managed to win the championship of the World University Games under conditions of low temperature and headwind.

The weather on the day of the competition was the worst in several days. There was no sunlight, and the spectators wore coats or sweaters. The elderly even wore overcoats. The women's discus throwing area was set on the south side of the field, directly facing the wind. The 15 athletes participating in this final event were formidable, including world record holder Gabriele Reinsch from East Germany and Franka Dietz, who set the best result in the world this year.

According to the preliminary results, Hou Xue Mei was ranked last. The competition began. On her first attempt, Dietz threw 62.70 meters, and Reinsch threw 65.20 meters on her third attempt. When it was Hou Xue Mei's turn, this girl from Zhejiang with a big braid stretched out her arms, calm and unhurried, looked up at the wind, and with a loud shout, the discus flew out of her hand. 65.32 meters!

Hou Xue Mei finally smiled, she smiled so sweetly and naturally.

Good technique and physical fitness are not the decisive factors for victory, but a stable mental state is the guarantee for victory.

Hou Xue Mei remained calm under pressure, and her composed and elegant demeanor won the admiration of everyone.

    大将风度
    ——记侯雪梅荣获大学生运动会铁饼金牌
    中国女运动员侯雪梅8月28日晚荣获世界大学生运动会铁饼项目金牌。
    听白林教练说，女子铁饼运动员侯雪梅以前最怕天气不好，一遇风雨就叨咕个不停：“完了，完了。”可是昨天她却是在气温较低的条件下，顶着迎头风夺取世界大学生运动会冠军的。
    运动会开幕几天来，数昨天天气最糟糕，阳光一丝不见，观众们穿着风衣或羊毛衫，上了点年纪的还披上了防寒服。女子铁饼投掷区设在田赛场南侧，正好顶风。参加这一项目决赛的15个运动员阵容不凡，有世界纪录保持者、民主德国的加布丽勒·莱尼施，民主德国创造了今年世界最好成绩的弗朗卡·迪赤等。根据预赛成绩，侯雪梅在名单上排在最后一位。
    投掷开始。第一次迪赤就掷到62米70，莱尼施第三次投到65米20。轮到侯雪梅时，这个梳一条大辫子的浙江女子舒展开双臂，不慌不忙，昂首迎风，一声大喝，铁饼顿时脱手飞去。65米32！
    侯雪梅终于笑了，她笑得那么甜，那么自然。
    良好的技术和身体素质并非是夺取胜利的决定因素，稳定的心理素质却是夺取胜利的保证。
    侯雪梅临阵不慌，沉着潇洒的大将风度赢得了人们的钦佩。
