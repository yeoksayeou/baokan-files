Technological development has become a crucial driving force for the growth of industrial enterprises in China. Currently, large and medium-sized enterprises, which serve as the backbone of the national economy, allocate over 10 billion yuan annually to technological development. The technological level of industrial products is steadily approaching international advanced standards.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the concept of "relying on technological progress" has deeply penetrated enterprises, and technological development teams are becoming increasingly robust. By the end of last year, large and medium-sized enterprises had approximately 800,000 personnel dedicated to technological development, an increase of 1.4 times compared to 1985. Among these, about one-third hold engineering titles. Over the past three years, the technological development funding of large and medium-sized enterprises has more than doubled, reaching 12.44 billion yuan last year. Enterprise-funded projects accounted for more than half of this amount, indicating that enterprises have become the primary source of technological development funding.

Adapting to market demands has become a key focus for enterprise technological development. Post-contract enterprises are breaking away from the "arranged marriages" imposed by higher-level departments and are independently choosing their technological development paths based on market needs. Last year, out of the 26,000 technological development projects implemented by large and medium-sized enterprises nationwide, nearly half were arranged by the enterprises themselves based on market demands. Approximately 70% of the enterprises have achieved "one generation in trial production, one generation in design, and one generation in conceptualization," accelerating the pace of product updates. The annual output value of new products from large and medium-sized enterprises has reached over 60 billion yuan, with 6.3% of the total profit and tax revenue coming from new products.

Enterprise technological development is advancing towards high-tech and high-level domains. Currently, large and medium-sized enterprises are involved in high-tech fields such as computer software, large-scale integrated circuits, artificial intelligence robots, office automation, aerospace, remote sensing, and lasers, developing approximately 1,600 projects annually with investments in the billions. The technological level of development projects is continuously improving. Last year alone, 1,292 projects were certified by national and provincial/ministerial-level authorities as reaching the international standards of the 1980s, with 1,054 projects filling national gaps, an increase of over 100 projects compared to the previous year.

However, in the face of global industrial challenges, the current state of technological development in Chinese enterprises is far from optimistic. Currently, technological development personnel in large and medium-sized enterprises account for only 3% of the workforce, a significant gap compared to developed countries. Additionally, enterprise technological development is characterized by short-term behavior, emphasizing imports over absorption, and particularly, funding for new product development saw a significant drop last year. Some enterprises focus solely on expanding the market share of existing products, reluctant to take risks in developing new products.

    人员八十万　经费超百亿　涉足高技术
    大中企业技术开发速度加快
    开发人员比例低短期行为突出等状况有待改变
    新华社北京8月17日电　（记者吴士深）技术开发已经成为我国工业企业发展的重要导向。目前，作为国民经济支柱的大中型企业一年用于技术开发经费超过百亿元，工业产品技术正逐步向国际先进水平迈进。
    据国家统计局介绍，近年来，“依靠科技进步”的观念深入企业，技术开发阵容日趋强大。截至去年底，全国大中型企业技术开发人员达80万左右，比1985年增加1.4倍。其中，具有相当工程师职称的人员占1／3。大中型企业技术开发经费最近三年间增加1倍多，去年经费总额达124.4亿元，其中，企业自筹经费占一半以上。这表明技术开发经费以企业为主的局面已经形成。
    适应市场需要已经越来越明显地成为企业技术开发的主攻目标。承包后的企业纷纷摆脱上级部门的“包办婚姻”，面向市场“自我选择”展开技术开发活动。去年全国大中型企业组织实施的2.6万项技术开发项目中，企业根据市场需要安排的项目接近一半。约70％的企业做到“试制一代、设计一代、构思一代”，产品更新换代速度加快。大中型企业新产品年产值已达600多亿元，实现利税总额中有6.3％是新产品带来的。
    企业技术开发工作正在朝高技术、高水平方向进军。现在大中型企业技术开发已经涉足计算机软件、大规模集成电路、人工智能机器人、办公自动化、航天、遥感、激光等高技术领域，每年开发约1600个项目，投资额数亿元。技术开发项目成果水平也在不断提高，仅去年就有1292个项目经国家和省、部级鉴定为达到80年代国际水平，填补国家空白的项目达1054个，分别比上年增加100多项。
    但是，面对世界工业界的挑战，我国企业技术开发现状仍不容乐观。目前大中型企业技术开发人员只占职工人数的3％，这个比例与发达国家相差悬殊。同时，企业技术开发工作短期行为突出，重引进轻消化，特别是新产品开发资金去年大幅度下降，部分企业只顾扩大老产品市场占有率，不愿担风险开发新产品。
