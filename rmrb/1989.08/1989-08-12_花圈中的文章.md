    Articles in Wreaths
    Sending wreaths is originally meant to express the living's mourning. However, it is unclear why a silent competition has arisen among the people in the small city of Huáróng County. In recent years, the number of wreaths has surged. Previously, each funeral procession had only a few to over ten wreaths, but now it is common to see dozens, with some reaching up to 150. The size of the wreaths has expanded from one square meter to as high as ten meters. The price of wreaths has also risen, from 3 to 5 yuan each to 12 to 70 yuan. According to the city management department, from February to April this year, out of 24 funerals, 18 had between 60 to 150 wreaths. No wonder the wreath-making industry has rapidly developed in the county. Four years ago, there were fewer than 8 shops, but now there are 30. One wreath maker has built two houses worth over 60,000 yuan in recent years just from making wreaths.

    The reasons for the increase in wreaths during funerals are multifaceted:

    Rank and treatment awareness. During this year's Spring Festival, a retired cadre passed away. According to custom, the relevant departments notified the county-level leadership units to pay their respects. Although the number of wreaths was not the highest among the seven funeral processions on the same day, the number of wreaths sent by various units reached 80, still the highest among the collective wreaths of each funeral procession. It is said that in the current written or unwritten "rank" treatment, the number of wreaths sent has taken on a political treatment color in society.

    Vanity and comparison psychology. On the morning of March 11 this year, a funeral procession marched through Huáróng County, with seven cars leading the way, firecrackers exploding along the route, and brass bands and drums blaring. Accompanying them were over 130 wreaths, forming a nearly one-kilometer-long queue. It turned out that this was for a wealthy individual entrepreneur whose wife had passed away. It is said that he simply wanted to make it grand, spending nearly ten thousand yuan in the process. Therefore, the usual practice of giving money as a gift has also been incorporated into the "civilized mourning" with wreaths, making it even more grand.

    Invisible public opinion pressure. Whenever people watch a funeral procession formed by a long line of wreaths, they can hear comments like "The children are capable!" and "So many wreaths, even unit X sent one!" and other unclear praises. In February this year, during the funeral of a father of a responsible person in Chengguan Town, over 100 individual entrepreneurs along the street set off firecrackers, causing the entire city to echo with noise. An individual entrepreneur said, "When others have something, if you don't go, the pressure is great. What if I have something in the future?"

    花圈中的文章
    献花圈，本只寄托生者悼念之情。却不知为何在不大的华容县城里悄悄掀起社会人际的“竞争”。近年花圈陡然增多，从前每个殡丧队只几个至10多个，而现在动辄几十，多至150个；花圈由1米见方扩大到10米之高；花圈价日高，由3元、5元一个到了12至70元。仅城管部门今年2至4月所知的24家丧事送殡中，花圈数在60至150个的就达18家。难怪花圈制作行业，在县城迅速发展，4年前不足8家，至今已达30家，有个制作户靠做花圈，近年就建起了2栋价值6万多元的楼房。
    促成花圈在送殡丧事中升温的原因是多方面的：
    职级待遇观念。今年春节期间，一位离休老干部病故，有关部门依照惯例，告知县级各家领导机关凭吊。虽然花圈数在同日7支送殡队中并未夺魁，但以单位集体为主送的花圈数竟达80个，仍居各送殡队集体花圈数之首。据人介绍，在目前成文或不成文的“职级”待遇中，送花圈多少已涂上了政治待遇的社会色彩。
    虚荣攀比心理。今年3月11日上午，一列送殡队伍浩浩荡荡穿越华容县城，7部汽车挂白开道，鞭炮沿途敞放，管乐锣鼓轰鸣，与130多个花圈列成近1公里长的队伍。原来是县城一位富裕个体户中年丧妻。据说，只因他说了：“不惜用钱要热闹。”因此，平素以赠钱送情为主的“个人礼尚”，也一并纳进了花圈“文明吊丧”，一下热闹掉近万元。
    无形舆论压力。每当人们沿街观看一列列由花圈长龙组成的热闹送殡，便可听到“子女有能力！”“花圈真多，×单位都送了！”等说不清的褒慕评语。今年2月，城关镇某个协负责人为父亲送葬时，沿街100多个体户都鸣放鞭炮，一时全城轰鸣。一个体户说：“人家有事，你不去压力可大啊，以后我有事呢？”
