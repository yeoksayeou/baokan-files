In the Jiang'an Public Security Sub-bureau of Wuhan City, Hubei Province, there are often people who come to plead, entertain, or send gifts. However, no matter how much they plead or entertain, they cannot take away any officer, and the gifts sent are all returned. The reason is that there is a clean and upright party committee leading by example.

The Jiang'an Sub-bureau Party Committee has established a rule: Party Committee members are not allowed to deal with those who plead, entertain, or send gifts, and they are certainly not allowed to help anyone with personal matters. One evening in June this year, a resident, in order to solve the problem of his wife and children's "agricultural to non-agricultural" household registration, asked someone to find the deputy director in charge of household registration, Jin Maolin, to help, and even sent a basket of mandarins. Jin Maolin immediately asked the Discipline Inspection Commission to take the gift away that night. Not long after, the household registration that the resident applied for was solved according to the policy, and he sent some gifts again, but Jin Maolin refused them and criticized the person who sent the gifts.

In early April this year, the son of a factory director was caught for stealing and was arrested. The director found the younger brother of the sub-bureau's party committee deputy secretary and director, Xu Yuqing, asking him to show mercy. Xu sternly said, "You are asking me to show favoritism, this is forcing me to break the law! If you continue to plead and make small moves, be careful not to violate the criminal law!" The person had to leave quickly.

"You give me convenience, I give you convenience," in the Jiang'an Sub-bureau, you can't find anyone like that. The political commissar, Luo Chuanming, has a daughter who was sent to work at the grassroots level two years ago. Someone was very enthusiastic about wanting to transfer his daughter to a large organization. Old Luo firmly said, "No! Whoever dares to help with this, I will expose him!" Now, his daughter is still working at the grassroots level. The leaders of the sub-bureau lead by example, and the entire bureau has formed a good practice of strictly adhering to the law. Over time, the Jiang'an Sub-bureau has been called the "dead end" for those who plead.

    党委清　全局清
    周开群
    在湖北省武汉市江岸公安分局，常有说情、请客、送礼的人上门。可是，说情请客者扯破衣服也拉不走哪一名干警，送来的礼品都被退了回去。原来，这里有廉洁清正的党委一班人在起表率作用。
    江岸分局党委立了一条规矩：党委成员不得同说情、请客、送礼者打交道，更不准为任何私人帮忙办事。今年6月的一天晚上，有位居民为了解决妻儿的“农转非”户口，托人找分管户政工作的副局长金茂林帮忙，还送了一筐广柑。金茂林连夜请纪委派人把礼物拿走。时隔不久，这位居民申报的户口按政策得到解决，他又送上一些礼品，结果仍被金茂林谢绝，并批评了这位送礼人。
    今年4月初，一位工厂领导的儿子因盗窃犯罪被抓获，他找到局党委副书记、局长徐玉清的内弟，要求老徐手下留情。老徐严肃地说：“你们要我徇私情，这是逼我犯法呀！如果你们继续说情，搞小动作，当心触犯刑律！”来人只好赶紧离开。
    “你给我方便，我给你方便”，这在江岸分局根本找不到主儿。政委罗传明的女儿，两年前被派到基层工作，有人很热心地想把他的女儿调到大机关去。老罗知道后，坚决地说：“不行！谁敢帮这个忙，我就揭发他！”现在，他的女儿仍然在基层工作。分局领导以身作则，全局上下，形成了严守法律的好作风。久而久之，江岸分局被人们称为说情者的“死胡同”。
