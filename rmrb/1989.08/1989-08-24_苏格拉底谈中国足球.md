	Socrates on Chinese Football

	Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 23rd – (Reporter Hé Huìfēi) Brazilian football star Socrates said in Guangzhou today that Chinese football players need to further strengthen their physical training.

	Socrates came to Guangzhou with the Brazilian Santos football team. When asked about his impressions after playing against six Chinese teams, Socrates replied, "Before coming to China, I didn't know much about it. Now I find that in the past, there were fewer people in China who liked football, so the level of football is not very high. Now, more and more people in China like football, and I believe the level will improve quickly."

	Socrates said that because of the lack of contact with the Chinese football circle in the past, it is difficult to accurately describe the characteristics of Chinese football based on just these few matches. He said that his impression of these few matches is still good, but the players' tactics and physical training need to be further improved. He frankly said that if the Chinese team can play to its strengths, there is still hope to participate in the World Cup finals.

	Socrates finally said that he and his teammates are very interested in China, and this time they had the opportunity to learn about many of China's ancient cultures and modern civilizations. Socrates expressed his gratitude to many people in China who care about him. Santos football team's head coach Junior also accepted the reporter's interview. He also holds the same view as Socrates, that from the competition, Chinese players need to greatly strengthen their physical training.

    苏格拉底谈中国足球
    新华社广州8月23日电  （记者何惠飞）巴西球星苏格拉底今天在广州说，中国足球选手的体能训练还需要进一步加强。
    苏格拉底是随巴西桑托斯俱乐部足球队前来广州的。记者请他谈谈与中国6支球队交锋后的印象。苏格拉底回答说，来中国之前，对此不是很了解。现在发现，中国喜欢足球的人过去比较少，因而足球水平不是很高；如今中国有越来越多的人喜欢足球，相信水平会很快提高。
    苏格拉底说，由于过去和中国足球界接触很少，光凭这几场比赛是很难将中国足球的特点说得很确切的。他说他对这几场比赛的印象还是不错的，但队员的战术和体能训练还需要进一步提高。他坦言道，如果中国队能发挥出自己的特长，还是有希望参加世界杯决赛的。
    苏格拉底最后说，他和他的队友对中国都非常感兴趣，这次他们有机会了解到了许多中国的古老文化和现代文明。苏格拉底对中国许多关心他的人们表示感谢。桑托斯俱乐部足球队主教练儒尼奥尔也接受了记者的采访，他也持有同苏格拉底一样的看法，从比赛来看，中国队员的体能训练需要大大加强。
