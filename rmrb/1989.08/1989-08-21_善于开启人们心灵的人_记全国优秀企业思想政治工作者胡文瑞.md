In April 1989, Nanjing hosted the National Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Conference. A man in his forties was delivering his paper, "Macro Guidance Method," which was rich in both practice and theory, earning him a round of applause from the audience. He was Hu Wenrui, the director of the Second Oil Extraction Plant of the Changqing Petroleum Exploration Bureau in Gansu. At this conference, he received the Excellent Paper Award and the title of National Excellent Enterprise Ideological and Political Worker.

Facing these honors, Hu Wenrui had a lot on his mind...

It was spring of 1984. His superiors assigned him to the Oil Plant No. 2 as the director. He graduated from the Petroleum Institute, had worked as a laborer, done grassroots work, and had also served as the deputy director of the production office of the management bureau. However, now he was faced with a large enterprise with over 6,000 employees, fixed assets worth over 600 million yuan, and the mission to develop petroleum for the country. He felt the weight of his responsibilities. His observations in the plant over a few days made him even more uneasy: the workers' morale was unstable, there were many complaints, and a group of people were pestering him to transfer jobs. The personnel department had a pile of transfer requests over a foot high. This oil extraction plant located in the Loess Plateau of Longdong was far from the city, and the living conditions were quite harsh: in the distance, mountains stretched on, and apart from the oil pumps and derricks, there was nothing but desolate hills; the vast plant site had only one cinema and a small shop, with dirty water everywhere, making it both messy and filthy.

How to manage such an environment and the workers' spirits? Hu Wenrui couldn't sleep. He found the party secretary, Han Zhiyuan, who had entered the plant at the same time, and discussed the situation. They agreed that they needed to put a lot of effort into strengthening ideological and political work to boost morale. However, the party secretary fell ill and was hospitalized. Hu Wenrui had to shoulder both production and ideological and political work.

Let people feel the warmth of socialism through practical actions

The production site of Oil Plant No. 2 spans three counties, with a long front line, scattered workers, and harsh working conditions. Hu Wenrui decided to first focus on improving the dirty, chaotic, and substandard living and working environment. Over several years, he and the workers planted over 510,000 trees in the plant area, laid down patches of lawn, and turned the plant into a lush, green oasis with micro-gardens; in the residential area, smooth and clean asphalt roads replaced the bumpy yellow earth; 31 new dormitory buildings were constructed, and over 900 households moved into new homes. Near the dormitories, they set up water stations, convenience stores, and snack bars... All 15 canteens in the plant achieved dining hall status, operating 24 hours a day, so workers could eat hot meals at any time.

Hu Wenrui led the workers of Oil Plant No. 2 to carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance, transforming not only the desolate mountains but also themselves. A positive, optimistic mindset gradually took root among the workers.

Teaching through entertainment and culture

The average age of the workers at Oil Plant No. 2 is only 28, with young people making up the majority. Their interests are broad, and their desire for knowledge is strong. Hu Wenrui proposed: teach through entertainment and culture, using rich and varied, healthy and beneficial cultural activities to influence the workers.

The plant raised funds and mobilized workers to volunteer, building a workers' cultural center that includes a library, reading room, game room, labor protection education room, and central dance hall. With an activity space, the plant's performing arts troupe, orchestra, men's and women's basketball teams, and 13 amateur cultural organizations such as calligraphy, photography, poetry, stamp collecting, and floriculture were established. Here, many young and middle-aged workers released their potential, showcased their talents, and fulfilled their desires for self-participation and self-expression, leading to the disappearance of gambling, drunkenness, and fighting. The work of Huang Lu, a member of the plant's photography team, won the first prize in the Gansu Provincial Photography Exhibition and the third prize in the National Photography Exhibition.

Hu Wenrui said that the new generation of "oil workers" should not only know how to work hard in the old way but should also have excellent technology and good cultural literacy. The plant built a 1500-square-meter workers' education building, which became the training center. Over 18,000 people have participated in learning and training, studying culture and technology, and the overall quality of the workforce has improved.

Respecting workers' democratic rights

At Oil Plant No. 2, all major decisions of the enterprise are widely consulted with the workers, verified by the factory's "think tank," and finally decided collectively by the expanded factory meeting. Since 1985, they have insisted on the director's reception day, situation briefings, and irregular consultations. The director's speeches are not empty promises. Over four years, the factory leadership has received thousands of workers, solving over 800 problems. In 1988, after implementing the director's responsibility system, Hu Wenrui proposed setting up a democratic supervision hotline and a corruption reporting box for the factory. For issues related to the people's vital interests, transparency is increased. The issue of converting agricultural workers to non-agricultural status has always been a sensitive issue that workers care about. In recent years, this factory has listed workers from rural areas by age, work years, and children's situation, and publicly announced the number of conversion quotas, the objects to be solved, and the family difficulties, allowing everyone to express their opinions and make judgments, and finally make a decision. All workers in the factory are convinced.

Last October, the factory's collective economic development company needed to add a batch of middle-level leaders and managers. Some people heard the news and rushed to the factory leaders to get notes or request transfers there. Hu Wenrui said that any notes are invalid, and this batch of cadres will be publicly recruited. The notice was issued, and 126 people signed up. On the day of the public defense, the venue was full. After fierce competition, 32 people won. The successful candidates happily took up their new positions, and the unsuccessful candidates had no complaints. This is called fair competition.

Now, Oil Plant No. 2 has a strong sense of belonging among its workers. Those who used to ask to leave this desolate mountain valley have now taken back their transfer requests. A couple who had struggled for years to transfer to Lanzhou went to the personnel department to request a return to Oil Plant No. 2. The will of thousands of workers has coalesced into a powerful force, continuously changing the face of the enterprise and making production flourish. In recent years, the plant has successively won the titles of "Advanced Oil Extraction Plant," "Advanced Enterprise Management Unit" awarded by the Petroleum Industry Department, and "Advanced Collective in Party Wind Work" awarded by Gansu Province.

    善于开启人们心灵的人
    ——记全国优秀企业思想政治工作者胡文瑞
    本报记者　李茜
    1989年4月，南京，全国职工思想政治工作研究会在这里召开。一位40来岁的中年人，正在宣读他的论文《宏观引导法》，有实践，有理论，博得了全场的热烈掌声。他就是甘肃长庆石油勘探局采油二厂厂长胡文瑞，这次会上，他获得了优秀论文奖和全国优秀企业思想工作者称号。
    面对着这些荣誉，胡文瑞思绪万千……
    那是1984年春天。上级派他到石油二厂任厂长。他毕业于石油学院，当过工人，做过基层工作，也曾在管理局生产办公室当过副主任。可是，如今摆在他面前的，是一个拥有6000多名职工、6亿多元固定资产、为祖国开发石油的大企业，他感到肩上担子沉重。进厂几天的所见所闻，更使他不安：职工情绪不稳定，牢骚多，一伙人缠着他闹调动工作，人事科压了一尺多厚的请调报告。这个坐落在陇东黄土高原上的采油厂，远离城市，生活环境相当艰苦：远处，山连着山，除了抽油机、井架，剩下的便是荒凉的山峁；偌大的厂基地只有一座电影院，一个小商店，满地污水，又脏又乱。
    这样的环境，人们这样的精神状态，该如何着手治理？胡文瑞失眠了。他找到与自己同时进厂的党委书记韩志远，商谈起来，一致认为：要花大力气加强思想政治工作，振奋人的精神。可是没想到，党委书记患病住院。他只好挑起生产和思想政治工作两副重担。
    让人们从事实中感受社会主义的温暖
    采油二厂的生产现场横跨三个县，战线长，工人分散作业，劳动条件艰苦。胡文瑞决心首先着力改善脏乱差的生活和劳动环境，几年间，他和职工在厂区栽种了各种树木51万株，铺设了一片片草坪，把厂区点辍得郁郁葱葱，出现了一个个微型花园；在家属区，平坦干净的柏油路替代了坑洼不平的黄土地；又新建了31幢宿舍楼，900多户职工迁进新居，在宿舍楼附近还设立了开水站、小卖部、小吃部……全厂15个职工食堂全部实现了餐厅化，24小时营业，工人们随时可以吃到可口的热饭菜。
    胡文瑞带领采油二厂的工人们发扬艰苦创业的精神，既改造了荒漠的大山沟，也改造了他们自己。一种积极进取，乐观向上的思想在职工中逐渐成长起来。
    寓教于乐　寓教于文
    采油二厂的职工平均年龄不过28岁，年轻人居多数，他们的兴趣广泛，求知欲强。胡文瑞提出：寓教于乐，寓教于文，用丰富多采、健康有益的文化活动来影响职工。
    厂里自己筹资，发动职工义务劳动，兴建了职工文化中心，包括图书室、读书厅、游艺活动室、劳动保护教育室和中心舞厅等设施。有了活动天地，厂文艺演出队、管弦乐队、男女篮球队成立了，书画、摄影、诗社、集邮、花卉等13个业余文化组织相继建立。在这里，许多中青年职工潜在的能量释放出来了，才智得到了发挥，自我参与、自我表现的愿望得到了满足，赌博、酗酒、打架等不良现象随之消失。工厂摄影成员黄路的作品，获得甘肃省摄影展览一等奖，全国摄影展览三等奖。
    胡文瑞说，新一代的“油汉子”不能只知道按老办法苦干，还应该有优等的技术、良好的文化素养。厂里建起了一幢1500平方米的职工教育大楼，成为职工培训中心。参加学习培训的已达18000多人次，他们学文化，学技术，整个职工队伍的素质也随之提高。
    尊重职工民主权利
    在石油二厂，凡是企业的重大决策，都广泛征求职工的意见，经工厂的“智囊团”论证，最后由厂务扩大会议集体讨论决定。1985年以来，他们坚持了厂长接待日、形势发布会、不定期的恳谈会。厂长讲话不开空头支票。4年间，厂领导接待工人上千人次，解决各类问题800多个。1988年实行厂长负责制后，胡文瑞提议工厂设了民主监督专用电话，设立廉政举报箱。对关系到群众切身利益的问题，增加透明度。农转非历来是工人普遍关心的敏感问题。近几年，这个厂把家在农村的职工按年龄、工龄、子女情况列表排队，有了农转非指标，指标数额、解决对象、家庭困难情况张榜公布，让大家发表意见，进行评判，最后作出决定，全厂职工心服口服。
    去年10月，厂集体经济开发总公司需要增加一批中层领导和管理人员，有些人听到消息，纷纷找厂领导批条子或提出调到那里去的要求。胡文瑞说，任何人批条子都无效，这批干部在全厂公开招聘。通知发出，报名的达126人。公开答辩那天，会场座无虚席，经过激烈的角逐，最后32人获胜。中聘者高高兴兴走上新岗位，落榜者也没意见。这就叫公平竞争。
    如今的采油二厂，职工中萌发了强烈的爱厂意识。过去要求调离这个荒凉山沟的人，现在纷纷取回了调离申请书。一对多年奔波才调往兰州的夫妻，又到人事科要求回到采油二厂。数千名职工的意志，凝聚成一股强大的合力，不断改变着企业的面貌，使生产蒸蒸日上。近几年，这个厂先后荣获石油工业部颁发的“先进采油厂”、“企业管理先进单位”和甘肃省“党风工作先进集体”等称号。
