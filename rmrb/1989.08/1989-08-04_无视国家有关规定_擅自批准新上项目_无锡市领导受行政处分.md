The People's Government of Jiangsu Province today issued a decision on the handling of errors made by the People's Government of Wuxi in the cleanup of fixed asset investment projects: Market Mayor Wang Hongmin, who bears leadership responsibility, is given an administrative warning, and Vice Mayor Xue Chengzhi, who bears direct responsibility, is given a major demerit in administrative discipline.

From last October to this January, the People's Government of Wuxi ignored the relevant regulations of the State Council regarding the cleanup of fixed asset investment projects and arbitrarily approved a batch of new construction projects. The General Office of the State Council issued a circular in May this year, making serious criticisms and instructing the provincial government to handle the matter seriously. The provincial government immediately dispatched a working group to Wuxi to conduct a comprehensive review, ordering the suspension of construction for all projects that violated regulations. The provincial government has submitted a special report to the State Council on the handling of the errors made by the Wuxi Municipal Government in the cleanup of fixed asset investment projects.

    无视国家有关规定  擅自批准新上项目
    无锡市领导受行政处分
    本报南京8月4日电  记者龚永泉报道：江苏省人民政府今天作出关于无锡市人民政府在清理固定资产投资项目中所犯错误的处理决定：对负有领导责任的市长王宏民同志给予行政警告处分，对负有直接责任的副市长薛成志同志给予行政记大过处分。
    去年10月到今年1月，无锡市人民政府无视国务院关于清理固定资产投资项目的有关规定，擅自批准新开工一批项目。国务院办公厅于今年5月发出通报，提出了严肃批评，责成省政府严肃处理。省政府随即派出工作组前往无锡，进行全面复查，令违反规定的项目一律停止建设。省政府已就处理无锡市政府在清理固定资产投资项目中所犯的错误，向国务院作了专题报告。
