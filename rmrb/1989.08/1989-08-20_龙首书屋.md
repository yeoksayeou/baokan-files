From the city of Yinchuan, travel west for eighty li, and you will reach the foothills of the Qilian Mountains—Dragon Head Mountain. Below the mountain, to the east, south, and north, stretches an endless expanse of desert. At dawn and dusk, the sunrise and sunset transform in color and shape, like a magician playing with a magical scarf, casting the desert's mushroom-like earthen dwellings in a myriad of colors, as if they were multicolored beans.

Among these dwellings, there is one that serves as our team's study room. It is 12 meters long and 6 meters wide, constructed from a large tent. Inside, there are six desks on the left and six on the right. Each desk has two benches, each bench seating two people, making a total of 24 benches for 48 people. This is just right, including the team leader, political commissar, chief of staff, and director, all 44 members of the team of demobilized officers have a seat. In the morning, the cultural instructor comes to teach, and everyone listens attentively, absorbing knowledge and talent, nourishing the spirit. In the afternoon, during self-study, each person reads their own books and writes their own essays. The seats are fixed; Zhang San's seat cannot be taken by Li Si, and Wang Wu's bench cannot be moved by Li Liu. There is no interference or intrusion. At first, the officers who had been in charge of troops were not used to it, feeling like they had thorns on their buttocks and couldn't sit still, so they wanted to go out for a walk. The instructor didn't stop them, letting them go. But after an hour or two, they would return, finding nothing interesting in the vast desert. They would come back to read again. Soon, their buttocks would settle, and they would sit until the lights went out, still feeling energetic, cursing, "Damn! Time makes even rabbits' legs grow, and they run fast!" Usually, once inside the room, no one was allowed to speak loudly, maintaining a quiet atmosphere like a lady's boudoir. There are four windows in the tent, each with a pot of jasmine in front. When the flowers bloom, their fragrance fills the air, mingling with the scent of books and the elegance of the written words, creating a harmonious atmosphere.

The political commissar enjoys drinking tea. Every day, he carries a large thermos, sipping tea and reading ten or twenty lines of text. He drinks tea all afternoon and finishes reading "The Lady of the Camellias." In the evening, he continues to drink tea, writing a few lines after each sip. By the end of the night, he has written an essay titled "On the Tragic Fate of the Lady of the Camellias and Its Thoughtful Implications." The essay was published in a magazine within half a year, and he received several dozen yuan in royalties. He used 40 yuan to buy Longjing tea and 40 yuan to buy literary classics, bringing both the tea and books to the study room. Before the tea was finished, the books were read. Discussing Balzac, Maupassant, and Belinsky, his lips flowed with aphorisms, his words were precise and insightful, and he spoke fluently, like pearls falling from his mouth, astonishing the cultural instructor! The instructor said, "If you don't work hard every day, you won't catch up with our political commissar." Thus, the trend of reading books in this ordinary earthen dwelling surged again.

One day, a delegation of calligraphers from Northwest China visited the study room. A famous calligrapher's disciple, pointing at Dragon Head Mountain, asked the team leader, "What is the name of that mountain?" The team leader replied, "Dragon Head Mountain." The calligrapher, upon hearing this, exclaimed three times, "Good! Good! Good!" Then he shouted, "Bring paper!" Once the paper, ink, and brush were ready, he lightly lifted his brush, and with a burst of energy, wrote four large characters: "Dragon Head Book House."

These four characters are now engraved on a rectangular jujube wood plaque, with a black lacquer base and gold-painted characters. It is now hanging on the lintel of the study room, exuding a scholarly atmosphere.

    龙首书屋王久辛
    出镍都向西行八十里，便是祁连山余脉——龙首山。山下，东南北三向伸延着望不到边沿的戈壁滩，一早一晚，朝霞和夕阳变幻着色彩和形状，像位魔术师玩弄着奇异的彩巾，把滩上小蘑菇似的地窝子，映得像一粒儿一粒儿的七彩豆豆儿。
    其中有那么一粒豆豆儿，便是我们团的学习室，长12米，宽6米，是用大号帐篷搭起来的。窝子里，左边6张条桌，右边6张条桌；条桌两边儿，各有两排条凳，一条可坐两人，24条便能坐48人，刚好，加上团长、政委、参谋长、主任，全团44名待业转业干部人人有座。上午，文化教员来讲课，大家全神贯注，句句顺着眼耳流进了人心里，变成了知识，化作了才华，滋补了精神；下午自习，你读你的书，我作我的文，反正位子是固定的，张三的座，李四不能坐；王五的凳，李六不能搬，互不侵犯，互不干涉。开始，带兵的干部不习惯，觉得屁股蛋子上生了刺儿，坐不住，便想出去蹓着玩。教员也不管他，任他去了。可他去了一时三刻，便又回来了，啥都不长的大戈壁上有啥玩头？又回来读书了。不久，屁股蛋子就沉了，一坐坐到熄灯，还挺气，骂一句“熊！时间长了兔子腿儿，蹿得倒快！”平时，只要进了室内，便不得乱伸舌头，静若淑女闺房。帐窗有四孔，孔前均有一盆茉莉，花开时香气袭人，随着读书人翻动的书页沁出书香，和着作文人指上捏着的笔管儿漫出了灵秀文章……政委好喝茶，每天端着一只大号的保温杯，喝一口茶，看十行二十行书上文字，他喝一下午茶，便看完了一本《茶花女》。晚上继续来喝茶，喝一口茶写几行文字，喝一晚茶，就写出了一篇《试论茶花女悲惨命运的思想蕴含》的论文！论文没出半年在杂志上发表，人家给他寄来几十元稿酬，他用40元买了龙井茶，40元买了文学名著，茶和书一齐拎到学习室，茶未喝完，书读完了，谈起巴尔扎克、莫泊桑、别林斯基，唇上警句叠出，话语剖析精密，口若悬河，妙语如珠，把个文化教员给震住了！说“一天不努力，赶不上咱政委”。于是，读书之风便在这个普通得不能再普通的地窝子里，又掀起了一股子热潮。
    有天，中国书法家西北参观团来此学习室参观之后，一位著名书法家的弟子指着龙首山问团长：“那山名啥？”答：“龙首山。”那书法家听罢连叫三声“好！好！好！”之后，又吆喝了一句“拿纸来”！纸笔砚墨备毕齐当，只见他狼毫轻扬，气神齐下，写下了4个大字“龙首书屋”。
    这4个字儿，已刻在一块长方形枣木匾上，黑漆涂底，金粉描字，现挂在学习室门楣上，自有一股子书斋之气。
