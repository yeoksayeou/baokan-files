Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 13th.

The first Asian Television Go Championship began today at the NHK Broadcasting Center in Tokyo. China's "Go Saint" Nie Weiping, playing black, defeated South Korean player Seo Nyeok, an 8th dan, by 5.5 points. Ma Xiaochun, a 9th dan, playing white, lost to Japanese 9th dan player Kobayashi Tsuneo in the middle of the game.

Six players are participating in this championship, two each from China, Japan, and South Korea. Ma Xiaochun and Nie Weiping are the champions and runners-up of this year's CCTV Cup. Japan's two players, Takeyama Michiharu and Kobayashi Tsuneo, are the champions and runners-up of the 1988 NHK Cup in Japan. South Korea's first candidate should have been Cho Hunhyeon, the champion of the 1987 and 1988 KBS King of Go tournaments, but he reportedly withdrew to prepare for the Ishizaki Cup final against Nie Weiping in September. Therefore, Seo Nyeok, the runner-up of the 1988 KBS King of Go tournament, and Kim Hee-jung, the runner-up of the 1987 KBS King of Go tournament, are participating.

The pairings for the first round were decided by a draw yesterday. The Asian Television Go Championship is a rapid game, with 30 seconds per move, and losing if more than 10 moves exceed 30 seconds.

Nie Weiping played very smoothly today and maintained an advantage throughout the game. The entire match lasted 70 minutes and consisted of 277 moves. After the game, Nie Weiping said that this match was relatively easy to play.

In the second match, Ma Xiaochun conceded after 189 moves. The final match of the first round between Takeyama Michiharu and Kim Hee-jung will be held tomorrow.

    首届亚洲电视围棋锦标赛
    聂卫平首战胜南朝鲜选手
    新华社东京8月13日电（记者姜占国）第一届亚洲电视围棋锦标赛今天在这里的NHK广播中心拉开战幕。我国“棋圣”聂卫平在首场比赛中执黑以5目半战胜南朝鲜棋手徐能旭八段，马晓春九段执白中盘负于日本九段棋手小林觉。
    参加本届锦标赛的共有6名棋手，中国、日本和南朝鲜各两名。马晓春和聂卫平是本年度CCTV杯冠、亚军。日本的两名棋手武官正树和小林觉是日本1988年度NHK杯冠、亚军。南朝鲜参赛的第一候选人本来应该是1987年度和1988年度KBS棋王战冠军曹薰玄，但据说他为准备9月份与聂卫平进行的应氏杯决赛而弃权，因此由1988年度KBS棋王战亚军徐能旭八段和1987年度KBS棋王战亚军金熙中七段参赛。
    第一轮比赛的对阵组合是根据昨天的抽签决定的。亚洲电视围棋锦标赛为快棋赛，30秒内走一手，10次超过30秒为负。
    聂卫平今天下得很顺利，自始至终处于优势。全盘比赛共用70分钟，共弈277手。聂卫平赛后说，这盘棋下得比较轻松。
    在第二场比赛中，马晓春是弈至第189手投子认输的。第一轮的最后一盘武宫正树对金熙中的比赛将在明天进行。
