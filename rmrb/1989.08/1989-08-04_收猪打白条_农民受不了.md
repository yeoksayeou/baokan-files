	Farmers Can't Bear the Burden of Receiving IOUs for Pig Sales

	"After much effort, two pigs were finally fattened, but four months after selling them, the payment still hasn't been received, and all that's left is an IOU." This is the frustration of some farmers in our county.

	From January to May, over 20,000 households in our county sold 26,389 pigs to the state. The relevant departments issued IOUs instead of immediate payment for the purchase of 26,000 pigs. The county food company owes farmers 6.53 million yuan for pigs. In fact, the county food company also has its troubles; external pig purchasing units owe them 6.78 million yuan, and the county's Industrial and Commercial Bank has only lent them 500,000 yuan in working capital.

	Farmers can't bear the burden of receiving IOUs for pig sales. A farmer from Bidu Township sold three pigs, totaling 1,430 yuan, but has not received a penny in over five months. Without money, he can't buy fertilizer. This spring, he couldn't fertilize his 10 mu of land, resulting in a significant reduction in wheat yield. A farmer from Atuo Township lamented, "The tobacco is about to be cured, and the corn needs fertilizer. If the pig money isn't paid, what will we use to buy curing coal and fertilizer?" According to a survey of 22 markets in our county: piglets are only 1.6 yuan per kilogram, equivalent to the price of two kilograms of corn, but few people are buying. Some households don't want to raise pigs, while others want to but lack the capital.

	We urge relevant units to take measures to redeem the IOUs as soon as possible.

### 收猪打白条　农民受不了

     收猪打白条　农民受不了
    “好不容易喂肥两头猪，可卖出去4个多月了，至今货款未能到手，还是一张白条。”这是我县一些农民的苦恼。
    1至5月，我县两万多户农民向国家交售生猪26389头，有关部门对收购2.6万头生猪未能立即向农民支付货款，而只是开了白条，县食品公司共欠农民猪款653万元。其实，县食品公司也有苦难言，外地调猪单位欠他们678万元，县工商银行仅贷款给他们50万元流动资金。
    收猪打白条，农民怎能承受得了？毕都乡一农民售猪3头，计款1430元，已5个多月未得到一文现金。没钱买不了化肥。今春他10亩地没施化肥，小麦大减产。阿陀乡一农民哭丧着脸说：“现在黄烟快烤了，玉米快追肥了，不兑现猪钱，我们拿什么买烤烟煤和化肥呢？”据我县22个集市调查：仔猪每公斤只要1.6元，相当于两公斤玉米钱，可很少有人问津。有的农户不想养猪，有的想养，但苦于没本钱。
    呼吁有关单位采取措施，尽快兑现白条。
