Liaoyang Agricultural Bank Strengthens Internal Checks through Institutional Measures

	Relatives Must Avoid Working Together; Cadres to Be Transferred to Different Locations
	No Cases of Loan Abuse Discovered This Year

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 22nd — (Correspondent Chen Dian Sheng) To prevent the misuse of loans and the issuing of personal favors, the Liaoyang Agricultural Bank has implemented a policy of avoiding relatives working together and transferring cadres to different locations, achieving good results.

	Since March of this year, the Liaoyang Agricultural Bank has implemented a policy of avoiding relatives working together. This policy stipulates that parents, children, spouses, siblings (including cousins and half-siblings), in-laws, and other relatives must not work in the same branch or credit union. Those who are already working together must be transferred. Those who refuse to be transferred will have their contracts terminated if they are contract workers, or be dismissed if they are permanent employees. So far, 119 people have been transferred, accounting for 54% of those who needed to be transferred.

	At the same time, to address the issue of long-term local work by grassroots cadres, which leads to complex relationships and difficulties in breaking personal ties, potentially resulting in personal favors and misuse of loans, the bank has implemented a policy of transferring grassroots branch managers to different locations. So far, 45 out of the 89 branch managers in the city have been transferred within their respective counties or districts.

	The policies of avoiding relatives working together and transferring cadres to different locations have strengthened internal checks and balances, freeing leaders from entanglements in personal relationships. Some branch managers have dared to enforce rules and regulations. In the first half of this year, the Liaoyang Agricultural Bank issued 69.8 million yuan in agricultural loans, with no cases of misuse of loans discovered.

    辽阳农行从制度上强化内部制约
    亲属一律回避　干部异地交流
    今年以来未发现以贷谋私行为
    新华社沈阳8月22日电  （通讯员陈殿升）辽阳市农业银行为防止以贷谋私，发放人情款，今年实行了亲属回避和干部异地交流制度，取得了较好的效果。
    辽阳市农行从今年3月起实行的亲属回避制度规定，父母、子女、夫妻、兄弟（包括堂兄弟、表兄弟）、姐妹（包括堂姐妹、表姐妹）、翁婿、婆媳等亲属一律不得在同一个营业所或信用社工作。凡在同一个单位工作的坚决调离，不服从调动的，是合同工的解除合同，是固定工的予以辞退。到目前为止，已有119人回避，占应回避人数的54％。
    在实行回避的同时，他们还针对基层单位干部长期在一地工作，亲朋故旧多，人际关系复杂，难以打破情面，容易出现人情贷款、以贷谋私等不正之风的问题，对基层营业所和信用社主任实行了异地交流制度。到目前为止，全市89个社所主任已有45个在本县区内交流完毕。
    亲属回避制度和干部异地交流，强化了内部制约，领导干部避免了人际关系的纠缠。一些社所主任敢抓敢管，各种制度得以执行落实。今年上半年辽阳市农行投放了6980万元农业贷款，没有发现以贷谋私行为。
