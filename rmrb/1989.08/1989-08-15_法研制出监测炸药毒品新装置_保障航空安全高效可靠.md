France has developed a new automatic detection device, which is based on a neutron generator. This device can efficiently and reliably detect explosives and drugs in airline luggage. It can screen 700 to 1,200 pieces of luggage per hour.

According to the French Industrial and Technological Information Center based in Frankfurt, West Germany, the detection rate of this device can reach 99.8%, making it unique in the world. Its performance is far superior to X-ray imaging or gas detectors.

The working principle of this device is as follows: the device first emits a slow neutron beam at the luggage being inspected. The atoms struck by the neutrons emit gamma rays, which can identify the corresponding atoms and determine the characteristics of explosive or drug elements, such as nitrogen, hydrogen, or chlorine, and their concentrations. For suspicious luggage, a second inspection is conducted using a fast, high-energy neutron beam. The entire process takes only a few seconds. If the same suspicious elements are detected in the second inspection, the luggage will be automatically separated for further examination.

This device is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing luggage conveyor systems. The French Civil Aviation Authority has decided to install this device at an airport in Paris by early 1990.

### 法研制出监测炸药毒品新装置  保障航空安全高效可靠

    法研制出监测炸药毒品新装置
    保障航空安全高效可靠
    新华社波恩8月11日电　（记者胡旭东）法国原子能委员会和一家公司合作，发明了一台以一部中子发生器为核心的全自动探测仪器。用它来探测航空行李中是否藏有炸药和毒品，既高效，又安全可靠。它每小时可监测行李700—1200件。
    据设在西德法兰克福的法国工业和技术信息中心最近宣布，这台仪器的侦破率可达99.8％，其效能是世界上“独一无二的”，远比X线透视方法或气体检查器可靠。
    这台仪器的工作方法是：仪器首先向受检查的行李发射慢速的中子束，受撞击的原子核便发生一定的伽玛射线，它可以确定相应的原子，确定炸弹或毒品元素的特征，如氮、氢或氯及其浓度。对于可疑的行李物品便用快速的、高能中子束进行第二次照射，整个过程只需几秒钟。如果在第二次照射中同样确定了可疑的元素，那么，行李会被自动分离出来，可以开包接受检查。
    这台仪器在设计时考虑到了现有的行李传送系统，所以可以毫无问题地与现有行李传送系统形成整体，法国民航局已决定在1990年初在巴黎一机场安装这种仪器。
