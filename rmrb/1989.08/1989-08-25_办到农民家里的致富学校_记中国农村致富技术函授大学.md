In Yunnan City, Fujin County, Jiangsu Province, there is a young female farmer named Chen Hongxia. She has always wanted to lead her fellow villagers to prosperity and change the backward appearance of her hometown. In 1984, she tried to raise 80 long-haired rabbits and 1,600 pearl mussels with great enthusiasm. However, due to her lack of scientific breeding techniques, the long-haired rabbits died of diarrhea within three days. The pearl mussels also yielded very few pearls. By the end of the year, after calculating the losses, a year's worth of labor was wasted, and she incurred a loss of over 3,000 yuan. However, just a year later, the same Chen Hongxia successfully raised 100,000 snails, 50,000 bullfrogs, and over 100 green turtles, earning an economic benefit of over 20,000 yuan. When asked where she learned her skills, Chen Hongxia solemnly said that her secrets to prosperity were all obtained from the Chinese Rural Prosperity Technology Correspondence University.

In 1987, the Yancheng region had 16,000 people enroll in this university, which helps farmers escape poverty and achieve prosperity.

The Chinese Rural Prosperity Technology Correspondence University (hereinafter referred to as the Rural Correspondence University) was established under the active advocacy of famous scientists and educators such as Mao Yisheng and Dong Chunxai, and is sponsored by the Chinese Association for Science and Technology. It is aimed at rural areas and township enterprises, with the goal of imparting practical technologies and cultivating millions of "permanent" technical talents who can lead the masses to prosperity. Since its establishment in 1985, over 250,000 students have been trained through this university without walls, improving the quality of labor and becoming leaders in helping local farmers escape poverty and achieve prosperity. The masses affectionately refer to it as the "school of prosperity that comes to your home." The number of farmers enrolling in the Rural Correspondence University increases year by year, and the number of students in the fourth cohort (1988) exceeded the total of the previous three cohorts.

Giving You a "Golden Key" to Escape Poverty and Achieve Prosperity

Zhang Jingyuan, a student from Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, suffers from tuberculosis and cannot do heavy work. With a family of six relying on him for support, his life was very difficult. To treat his illness and support his children's education, he had to borrow thousands of yuan each year. In 1987, after enrolling in the Rural Correspondence University, he mastered scientific sheep-raising techniques. The 18 sheep and cattle he bought on credit became plump and healthy, quickly increasing to over 50. With more livestock and fertilizer, the crops also had a bumper harvest. After one year of studying at the Rural Correspondence University, he paid off all his debts and had a surplus of over 10,000 yuan. There are countless such examples in the short history of the Chinese Rural Correspondence University, where farmers rely on scientific technology to quickly escape poverty and achieve prosperity.

The root cause of poverty and backwardness in old revolutionary base areas is the low cultural level of the masses. To change the appearance of these areas, it is necessary to combat poverty and ignorance simultaneously, popularize scientific and technological knowledge, and improve the quality of labor. The Rural Correspondence University faces the countryside, imparting practical technologies for escaping poverty and achieving prosperity, which is an effective way to revitalize the economy of these regions. The Heilongjiang Provincial Branch School takes developing the intelligence of poor households and enabling poor students to master one or two practical technologies to quickly escape poverty and achieve prosperity as its educational goal. They adopt a method of combining technical training with financial aid to poor households, making most of the over 30,000 students enrolled since 1986 escape poverty in the same year. According to statistics, the per capita annual income of the second cohort's families before enrollment was over 260 yuan, and it reached over 430 yuan upon graduation, with a poverty escape rate of 79% that year. In 1987, Youyang Tujia and Miao Autonomous County, a key poverty-stricken county in Sichuan Province, enrolled 1,200 students, and after one year, 80% of the students' families escaped poverty, with 20% of the families becoming relatively prosperous to varying degrees. The students' common feeling is that the Rural Correspondence University gave them the "golden key" to escape poverty and achieve prosperity.

A Cradle for New-Type Farmers

The establishment of the Rural Correspondence University has provided a path to success for many educated youth who have returned to the countryside. Many students who failed the college entrance examination, after a period of despair and confusion, participated in the learning and training of the Rural Correspondence University, quickly mastering the technology to lead their fellow villagers to escape poverty and achieve prosperity, and achieving results in developing local resources and developing the rural commodity economy. In Jiangxi Province, 27 educated youth from Hedong Township, Liancheng City, participated in the learning of the Rural Correspondence University and promptly introduced over 500 pounds of high-quality rapeseed from outside the province, promoting the sowing of over 2,500 acres across the township. After studying the course "Soil and Fertilizer," to improve the soil, they introduced over 2,000 pounds of red clover seeds from outside the province, sowing green manure across the township. Many students with excellent academic performance have become technical backbones in rural areas. Among the 15,000 graduates in Jiangxi Province, more than half have reached the level of farmer technical personnel, and over 3,000 have been appointed as township and village farmer technical personnel.

The improvement of scientific and cultural quality has promoted the change in farmers' ideas and promoted the construction of rural spiritual civilization. In the first and second cohorts of Baoji Branch School, 30% of the students were elected as representatives to various levels of party congresses, people's congresses, political consultative conferences, technical and economic experts, farmer entrepreneurs, March 8th Red Banner holders, and New Long March shock troops. Student Wu Wanzhong established a "Science and Technology Culture Room" in his home, providing science and technology services to the masses, carrying out activities to eliminate superstitions, promote legal knowledge, and advocate family planning. He also took the lead in organizing 23 students to establish the "Farmer Prosperity Technology Joint Service Department," becoming a good consultant for farmers' prosperity. He was elected as a provincial and municipal people's representative.

Pursuing Scale and Group Benefits

In the four years since its establishment, the Rural Correspondence University has helped tens of thousands of students' families embark on the path to escaping poverty and achieving prosperity. However, President Xiang Huaming said: Our goal in running the school should not stop at the individual benefits of stars and dots, but should make the students of the Rural Correspondence University become the sparks of spreading scientific technology, leading a village, a township, or even a county to prosperity, forming scale and group benefits. During the interview, we found that this educational idea has become a reality in many places. Li Shengyou, a student from the Yicheng Branch School in Hubei Province, is the party branch secretary of the village. Through his specialized studies, he led the entire village of over 1,000 households to reasonably adjust the planting structure, achieving good results. In the year of the century's worst disaster in 1988, all crops in the village increased production, and the per capita income of the villagers increased by over 280 yuan compared to the previous year.

A considerable proportion of the students of the Rural Correspondence University are rural cadres. They have long been working on the front line of agricultural production and have rich experience in organizing agricultural production. Once they master practical technologies, they will be like adding wings to a tiger, greatly changing the economic appearance of the locality. He Shenglin, a student from Yutian County, Hebei Province, and deputy director of the county science and technology commission, promoted model management demonstrations according to the teachings of the Rural Correspondence University, increasing wheat production by over 4.9 million pounds across the county. The importance of organizing and leading cadres to study scientific and technological knowledge has been recognized by many places. Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, requires all township and village grassroots cadres who have not mastered certain practical agricultural technologies to participate in the study of the Rural Correspondence University; the county committee secretary and county magistrate of Xinyang County, Henan Province, took the lead in participating in the study of the Rural Correspondence University.

The Secret of Success

The success of the Rural Correspondence University is first attributed to its set of understandable and usable good teaching materials. They organized over 200 experts and professors from agricultural universities and agricultural science academies to conduct field surveys in various rural areas and compiled and published 121 teaching materials in 4 series and 21 majors. Aiming at the characteristic of agricultural production being "ten li different skies," they also entrusted local branch schools to organize local "prosperity experts" and "specialty kings" to compile local teaching materials with local characteristics. They also collaborated with the Central People's Broadcasting Station to broadcast the "Rural Correspondence University" special program, providing technical information and guidance to complement the teaching materials. This program has become one of the programs with the highest listening rate on the radio.

Another key issue in correspondence education is teaching guidance. The Rural Correspondence University relies on the science and technology association system to establish over 250 provincial, municipal, and county-level branch schools and over 950 county-level guidance stations nationwide, initially forming a relatively standardized teaching guidance system from the central school to the township and village guidance classes, and having a sound face-to-face guidance system. Currently, the entire school has over 10,000 full-time and part-time teachers and management personnel. Local branch schools and guidance stations arrange learning content based on local resource advantages and economic development needs, ensuring that whatever project is developed, the corresponding major is studied. In 1987, the Jingan Mountain old revolutionary base area construction office determined 280 development projects, and the local branch school organized 12,000 students to study in the relevant 16 majors. Among the over 5,000 graduates of the local branch school, half have become the mainstays or leaders of the development projects. Recently, after visiting the school, Mr. Walter, an adult education expert from the World Bank, said: "Your establishment of a complete teaching guidance network across the country is very important and effective. You have made important contributions to the popularization and improvement of national cultural quality and farmer training."

The Rural Correspondence University uses learning to support learning and does not pursue profits. It is understood that the tuition fees of this school are the lowest among similar correspondence schools. Each student only needs to pay 65 yuan in tuition to obtain all teaching materials and 10 periods of teaching guidance materials for 5-14 courses. The school also returns most of the tuition fees to the students through the distribution of teaching materials, teaching guidance, and experimental practice. In 1988, the first enrollment of the Tai'an City Branch School in Shandong Province reached over 7,000. They calculated that setting up an agricultural secondary school with fewer than 400 students requires the state to invest tens of millions of yuan annually; setting up a new television university that can accommodate two classes requires an investment of tens of millions of yuan; while setting up this Rural Correspondence University branch school requires the state to spend less than 100,000 yuan. They sighed deeply and said: If relying on municipal finances to set up a regular school that can accommodate so many people, it is impossible under the current circumstances.

    办到农民家里的致富学校
    ——记中国农村致富技术函授大学
    本报记者　王友恭
    江苏省盐城市阜宁县有一个名叫陈红霞的青年女农民。她一心想带领乡亲致富，改变家乡落后面貌。1984年她凭着一股热情，试养了80只长毛兔、1600只珍珠蚌。但是，由于她不懂科学养殖技术，长毛兔拉稀三天内死光；珍珠蚌到头来也取珠甚少。到年底一结算，一年的劳动白搭上，还亏损3000多元。可是，时隔一年，还是这个陈红霞，养殖10万只福寿螺、5万只牛蛙和100多只绿毛龟，全获成功，获经济效益2万多元。有人问她何处得到真传，陈红霞郑重其事地说，她的致富真经都是从中国农村致富技术函授大学得来的。
    1987年，盐城地区就有1.6万人报名上这所能够帮助农民脱贫致富的函授大学。
    中国农村致富技术函授大学（以下简称农函大）是在著名科学家、教育家茅以升、董纯才等的积极倡导下，由中国科协主办的。它面向广大农村和乡镇企业，旨在传授实用技术，培养千百万能够带领广大农民致富的“永久牌”技术人才。从1985年创办以来，已有25万名学员通过这所没有围墙的大学的培训，提高了劳动者的素质，成为当地农民脱贫致富的带头人。广大农民亲切地称它为“办到家里的致富学校”。报名上农函大的农民逐年增多，第四届（1988年）学员超过前三届的总和。
    给你一把脱贫致富的“金钥匙”
    黑龙江省克山县学员张景远身患肺结核，干不了重活，全家6口人又全靠他一个人养活，生活十分困难。为了给自己治病、供孩子上学，他每年都要借债上千元。1987年他报名上农函大后，掌握了科学养羊技术，18头用贷款买来的羊、牛膘肥体壮，很快发展到50多头。畜多肥多，庄稼也获得丰收。他上农函大一年，年终还清了多年的欠账，还盈余上万元。像这类帮助农民依靠科学技术很快脱贫致富的事例，在中国农函大短短三、四年的校史上举不胜举。
    老区农村贫困落后的根源是广大农民文化素质低。要改变老区面貌就必须治穷与治愚并举，大力普及科学技术知识，提高劳动者的素质。农函大面向农村，传授脱贫致富的实用技术，正是振兴这些地区的经济的有效途径。黑龙省分校把开发贫困户智力，使贫困户学员掌握一、二项实用技术，迅速脱贫致富作为办学宗旨。他们采取技术培训与资金扶贫相结合的方法，使从1986年以来招收的3万多名学员大都当年脱贫。据统计，该分校第二届学员入学前家庭人均年收入260多元，结业时已达到430多元，当年脱贫率为79％。全国重点贫困县四川酉阳土家族苗族自治县1987年招收学员1200名，一年后80％的学员家庭脱贫，其中20％的学员家庭不同程度地富裕起来。学员们共同的感受是：农函大给了他们脱贫致富的“金钥匙”。
    新型农民的摇篮
    农函大的创办为广大回乡知识青年提供了成才之路。许多高考落榜生在失望彷徨之后参加农函大的学习培训，很快掌握了带领乡亲脱贫致富的技术，在开发当地资源，发展农村商品经济中做出了成绩。江西省临川市河东乡的27名回乡知识青年参加农函大的学习后，及时从外地引进500多斤良种油菜籽，在全乡推广播种2500多亩。学习《土壤与肥料》课程后，为了改良土壤，他们又从外地引进2000多斤红花草种，全乡播种绿肥16万多亩。许多学习成绩优良的学员已成为农村技术骨干。江西省已毕业的1.5万名学员中，半数以上达到了农民技术员的水平，其中3000多人已被聘为乡、村农民技术员。
    科学文化素质的提高，促进了农民观念的变化，推动了农村精神文明建设。宝鸡分校一、二届学员中，被选为各级党代会代表、人民代表、政协委员、技术致富能手、农民企业家、三八红旗手、新长征突击手的占30％。学员吴万忠在自己家里建立“科技文化室”，为群众开展科技服务，开展破除迷信、普法和计划生育宣传。他还带头组织23名学员建立了“农民致富技术联合服务部”，成为农民致富的好参谋。他被选为省、市人民代表。
    追求规模效益
    农函大办学四年来已使十几万学员家庭走上脱贫致富的道路，校长向华明却说：我们办学的目的不能停留在星星点点的个体效益上，而应使农函大的学员成为传播科学技术的火种，带动一个村、一个乡，甚至一个县富裕起来，形成规模效益、集团效益。在采访中，我们发现这个办学思想在不少地方已成为事实。湖北省宜城分校学员李生友是村党支部书记。他通过种植专业的学习，带领全村一千多户合理调整种植结构，取得良好效果。在当地百年不遇的大灾之年1988年，全村各项作物增产，全村人均收入比上一年增加280多元。
    农函大的学员中，农村干部占有相当大的比例。他们长期工作在农业生产第一线，有较丰富的组织农业生产的经验，一旦掌握了实用技术，便如虎添翼，会使当地经济面貌发生很大变化。河北省玉田县学员、县科委副主任贺森林根据农函大的传授，推行模式化管理示范，使全县小麦增产490多万斤。组织领导干部学习科学技术知识的重要性已被许多地方所认识。江苏省盐城市要求各乡镇和农村的基层干部，凡没有掌握一定农业实用技术的，一律要参加农函大学习；河南省新乡县的县委书记、县长带头参加农函大学习。
    成功之所在
    农函大取得的成功，首先归因于它有一套读得懂、用得上的好教材。他们先后组织了200多位农业大学、农业科学院的专家、教授赴各地农村考察后，编写出版了4个系列、21个专业的121种教材。针对农业生产“十里不同天”的特点，他们还委托各地分校组织当地“致富能手”、“专业大王”编写具有地方特色的乡土教材。他们还与中央人民广播电台合办“农函大”专题节目，配合教材进行辅导，传播技术信息。这个节目成为电台中收听率最高的节目之一。
    函授教育的另一个关键问题是教学辅导。农函大依托科协系统，在全国建立了省、地、市级分校250多所，县级辅导站950多个，初步形成了由总校到乡、村辅导班比较规范化的教学辅导体系，并有健全的面授辅导制度。现在全校共有专兼职教师和管理人员1万多人。各地分校和辅导站根据当地的资源优势和经济发展需要安排学习内容，做到开发什么项目就上什么专业。1987年井冈山地区老区建设办公室确定了280个开发项目，当地分校就根据这些项目把1.2万名学员组织到有关的16个专业中去学习。该地区分校已毕业的5000多名学员中，有一半人已成为开发项目的主持人或带头人。前不久，世界银行成人教育家沃尔特先生考察该校后说：“你们在全国各地建立完整的教学辅导网络是非常重要而有成效的。你们在普及提高国民文化水平和农民培训中作出了重要贡献。”
    农函大以学养学，不以盈利为目的。据了解，这个学校的学费在同类函授学校中是最低的。每个学员每人只要交65元学费，就可以得到5—14门课程的全部教材及10期教学辅导材料。学校还通过发放教材、教学辅导、实验实习，把学费的绝大部分返还给学员。1988年山东省泰安市分校首次招生达7000多名。他们算了一笔帐：办一所不到400名学生的农业中专，国家每年要投资几十万元；新办一个可以容纳两个班的电视大学，也要投资二三十万元；而开办这所农函大分校，国家花钱不到1万元。他们深有感慨地说：如果靠市财政办一所可以容纳这么多人的正规学校，在当前的情况下是不可能的。
