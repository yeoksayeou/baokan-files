Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 11th.

The first double-track electrified railway in China—the Daqin Railway Phase I Project—was put into operation on December 28th of last year. It has played a crucial role in accelerating the development of the Shanxi coal base. However, the frequent theft of operational equipment on the Chayuwu section of the Daqin Railway is worrying and heartbreaking.

In the first quarter of this year, 45 cases of operational equipment theft occurred in the Chayuwu area. Eight saturation transformers (each worth 1,050 yuan) were stolen, along with 34 sets of track fasteners and over 200 fishplate bolts. During this period, two communication poles and cables were smashed and stolen, and the pedestrian walkway and side railings of a bridge were completely stolen. Thefts of power supply, telecommunication, signaling, and other equipment frequently occurred, resulting in direct economic losses of over 30,000 yuan. On May 1st, more than 200 rail joints between Datong County and Dongjing were also stolen.

The western line of the Daqin Railway Phase I Project runs from Datong's Hanjiaping to Tianjin's Dashizhuang Station, with a total length of 410 kilometers. There are only 34 public security personnel along the entire line. Due to the long distance, numerous points, and limited personnel, coupled with the lack of transportation and communication tools, public security officers can only walk or ride bicycles to investigate after receiving reports, often missing critical opportunities.

We urge relevant departments to pay attention to the public security work on the Daqin Railway and provide necessary assistance to ensure the safe and punctual operation of the Daqin Railway, keeping it open and unobstructed.

### 大秦路茶坞段设备经常被盗

    大秦路茶坞段设备经常被盗
    我国第一条双线电气化铁路——大秦铁路第一期工程于去年12月28日投入运营以来，为加速山西煤炭基地的开发，发挥出重要的作用。然而，大秦铁路茶坞段行车设备经常被盗，令人担忧和痛心。
    今年第一季度，茶坞地区共发生行车设备被盗案件45起，丢失扼流变压器8台（每台价值1050元），线路扣件34套，鱼尾板螺栓200多条。在这一期间，这一地区被砸被盗通话柱电缆合2个，桥梁步行板、两侧护栏全部被盗走，供电、电务、通信、信号等设备被盗现象时有发生，造成直接经济损失3万多元。5月1日，大同县至东井集线路钢轨道接线又被盗200多根。
    大秦铁路一期工程西线由大同韩家岭至天津大石庄站，正线长410公里，全线公安干警只有34人。由于线长、点多、人手少，又没有交通工具、通讯工具，接到报案后，公安人员只好徒步或骑自行车前去侦破，常常贻误战机。
    呼吁有关部门重视大秦铁路的治安工作，给予必要的协助，以确保大秦铁路安全正点，畅通无阻。
