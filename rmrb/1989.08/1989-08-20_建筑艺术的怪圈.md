The rich and varied contemporary art is dazzling and awe-inspiring. If we delve into the complexities of contemporary art phenomena, we can uncover the secrets of contemporary art. For example, the four tourist hotels that were awarded the "Excellent Architectural Works of China in the 1980s" each have unique artistic expressions that allow us to glimpse the direction of contemporary art.

These four architectural works are: Wuyi Mountain Resort (designed by Qi Kang, Lai Juku, Yang Zishen, etc.), Xinjiang Reception Hotel (designed by Gao Qinglin, Luo Chuanhao, Wang Xiaodong, Wu Jianye, etc.), Longbai Hotel (designed by Zhang Yaozeng, etc.), and Que Li Hotel (designed by Dai Nianci, Fu Xiucui, etc.). The Wuyi Mountain Resort is located in the picturesque Wuyi Mountains. The designers took a unique approach, drawing inspiration from the local residential architectural vocabulary, creating a strong sense of local flavor. The layout of the building complex fully utilizes the natural terrain of the hills, creating a natural charm, returning to simplicity, and being fresh and elegant. Red tiles, vermilion pillars, plain walls, suspended floors, bamboo ceiling, bamboo and wood furniture, and the wild grass and gentle springs outside the courtyard all form an unforgettable pastoral poem. The Xinjiang Reception Hotel repeatedly uses pointed arches, pointed arch forms, and semi-circular arches, which are symbols of Islamic architecture, creating a distinctive Uyghur local flavor. The strong contrast of light and dark, and the color of the building, brings a modern feel. A pair of air conditioning cooling towers in the shape of a bell-shaped body, with beautiful and elegant shapes. All of this gives guests a sense of the strange charm of a city on the western border of China. The Longbai Hotel is built in the original Hongqiao Club in Shanghai. The designers seized the environmental characteristics, with a lively and relaxed building layout, focusing on large block combinations, with high and low levels, and flexible and varied spaces. The sloping walls of the lounge seem like roofs, echoing the steep-roofed image of the original British-style villas in the environment. The Que Li Hotel is located in the historical and cultural city of Qufu, adjacent to the key cultural relics of the Temple of Confucius and the Mansion of Confucius. In order to harmonize with the Temple of Confucius and the Mansion of Confucius, the authors used the old forms, with green tile roofs and simple and unadorned design. It does not pursue modernity or seek luxury. The hotel's elegant cultural style and delicate architectural techniques show the designer's refinement.

These four works show us the unremitting exploration of Chinese architects—they are constantly seeking the cultural characteristics of architecture. However, the choices of architects are highly individual. The Que Li Hotel has a more classical style, as the designers put it, "it is better to be a bit conservative"; the Longbai Hotel, on the other hand, prioritizes functionality and has a more modernist color; while the Wuyi Mountain Resort and the Xinjiang Reception Hotel have a certain postmodern flavor, containing traditional local symbols on the basis of modern architecture. This seems to reflect a vicious circle in contemporary art: from the modernism that bid farewell to tradition, it returns to the postmodernism that contains tradition. However, postmodernism is not a cultural trend that returns to tradition. Postmodernism and tradition are not on the same plane of a circle, but a vicious circle. Although they appear similar on the surface, postmodernism is an understanding of tradition at the level of modernist experiential frameworks. It is hoped that the architects' various choices can offer people a multi-layered living world.

    建筑艺术的怪圈
    王明贤
    丰富多彩的当代艺术令人目不暇接，叹为观止。如果对充满复杂性的艺术现象作一透视，就能发现当代艺术的奥秘。比如被评为“中国80年代建筑艺术优秀作品”中的四项旅游宾馆，它们各自独特的艺术表现可让人们窥测到当代艺术的走向。
    这四项建筑艺术作品是：武夷山庄（齐康、赖聚奎、杨子伸等设计），新疆迎宾馆（高庆林、罗传浩、王小东、吴建业等设计），龙柏饭店（张耀曾等设计）和阙里宾舍（戴念慈、傅秀蓉等设计）。武夷山庄位于风景佳绝的武夷山中，设计者另辟蹊径，吸取了当地民居的造型语汇，创造了浓郁的乡土气息。建筑群布局上充分利用山坡地势，自成天然之趣，返朴归真，清新隽逸。红瓦朱柱素壁，吊脚楼，竹席吊顶，竹木家具，还有庭院外那多情的野草和温柔的山泉，构成了一首令人难以忘怀的田园诗。新疆迎宾馆重复运用了尖拱、尖弧拱及半圆拱的构件和图形，这些伊斯兰建筑符号产生了维吾尔族地方特色，建筑物明暗、色彩的强烈对比带来了现代感。一对空调冷却塔成喇叭形塔身，造型美丽而典雅。这一切使宾客感受到中国西部边陲城市的奇异情调。龙柏饭店建于上海原虹桥俱乐部内，设计者抓住环境特色，建筑布局活泼舒展，着于大的体块组合，体型高低参差，空间灵活多变。休息厅倾斜的墙面又似屋面，与原来环境中英国式别墅陡坡顶形象呼应。阙里宾舍处于历史文化名城曲阜，与重点文物建筑孔庙、孔府近邻。为了与孔庙、孔府相协调，作者运用了旧形式，青瓦坡顶，朴实无华。不追求摩登，不希冀珠光宝气，宾舍古雅的文化格调和细腻的建筑手法，显示了设计者的修养。
    这四项作品让人们看到中国建筑师的不懈探索——他们孜孜以求的正是建筑的文化特色。然而，建筑师的选择却各具个性。阙里宾舍带有更多的古典风格，用设计人的话说是“宁愿保守一点”；龙柏饭店则以功能为前提，带有更多的现代主义色彩；而武夷山庄与新疆迎宾馆则带有一定的后现代色彩，在现代建筑基础上又蕴含传统乡土符号。这似乎也反映了当代艺术的一个怪圈：从告别传统的现代主义又回到带有传统的后现代主义。然而，后现代主义不是向传统复归的文化思潮。后现代与传统，不是一个平面上的圆圈，而是一个怪圈。二者虽有表面的相似，但后现代是在人们具有现代主义的经验图式的层次上来理解传统的。但愿建筑师的多种选择能给人们奉献一个多层次的生活世界。
