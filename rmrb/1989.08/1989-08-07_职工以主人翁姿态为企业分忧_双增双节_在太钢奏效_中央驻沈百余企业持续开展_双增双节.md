Workers at Taiyuan Steel, with an owner's attitude, share the burden of the enterprise. "Double Increase, Double Saving" has been effective at Taiyuan Steel. Over 100 centrally-administered enterprises in Shenyang continue to carry out "Double Increase, Double Saving."

BEIJING, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- The 60,000-odd workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, in the face of shortages in coal, electricity, and raw materials, have worked together to overcome difficulties and carry out the "Double Increase, Double Saving" campaign. In the first half of this year, they have achieved an economic benefit of over 30 million yuan. Since 1983, this campaign has accumulated an economic benefit of over 310 million yuan.

Taiyuan Steel is the largest producer of special steel in China. This year, in the face of difficulties, the workers of the entire company have not waited passively but have taken the initiative with an owner's attitude, sharing the company's joys and sorrows, and achieving remarkable results. The No. 3 Steel Plant, among others, has ensured quality while adopting measures such as "quota use of materials" and "non-standard supply of materials." In the first half of this year, they have saved 45 tons of nickel and reduced the cost of stainless steel smelting by 3.1 million yuan.

The workers of Taiyuan Steel have focused on the weak links in production and organized technical attacks. The No. 3 Blast Furnace is the largest blast furnace at Taiyuan Steel (with a capacity of 1,200 cubic meters). Due to the increase in the water temperature difference of the furnace shell cooling plate, the daily iron production has dropped to 1,870 tons, directly affecting the entire company's production. A task force composed of workers, technical personnel, and leading cadres adopted a "special care" method, increasing the daily output of this blast furnace to 2,100 tons.

In the first half of this year, the workers of Taiyuan Steel have proposed 7,665 rationalization suggestions, of which 4,243 have been adopted, and 898 have been implemented, creating an economic benefit of 12.8 million yuan after implementation. The furnace workers of the rolling workshop of the No. 2 Steel Plant proposed a suggestion to improve the heating furnace slab scale board, reasonably controlling the temperature, reducing the monthly consumption of scale board from 200 tons to 90 tons, saving 1.65 million yuan in raw material consumption. The masonry workers of the electric furnace workshop of the No. 2 Steel Plant used clay bricks instead of high-alumina bricks, not only extending the life of the furnace lining but also creating a new path for saving raw materials.

SHENYANG, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- This year, the "Double Increase, Double Saving" campaign has been effective in 123 centrally-administered enterprises in Shenyang. According to statistics, these enterprises have achieved an economic benefit of 82.5 million yuan in the first half of the year, completing 82.5% of the annual "Double Increase, Double Saving" plan.

To ensure the sustained and in-depth development of the "Double Increase, Double Saving" campaign, these centrally-administered enterprises in Shenyang have taken a series of effective measures. First, they have started from ideological education to guide workers to strengthen their "Double Increase, Double Saving" awareness and clarify targets, layer by layer. The Shenyang Liming Engine Manufacturing Company, with over 30,000 workers, has used various methods to explain to workers the "joys" and "sorrows" of the company's production and operation, enhancing workers' sense of responsibility as masters of the enterprise. In the first half of the year, the workers of the entire company have proposed over 1,000 rationalization suggestions, of which 353 have been implemented, creating an economic benefit of 11 million yuan.

Seeking benefits from science and technology, reducing material consumption, and improving production efficiency are another effective measure of these enterprises in the "Double Increase, Double Saving" campaign. The Shenyang Railway Signal Factory has placed the main target of tapping potential on improving the utilization rate of materials and energy and reducing material consumption. Through innovation and self-made equipment, they have increased the utilization rate of precious metals such as silver, phosphorus, and copper from 63% to over 94%, saving nearly 3 million yuan annually. These enterprises have also generally strengthened enterprise management. The Shenyang Branch of the Railway Materials Corporation has taken six measures, including appointing a dedicated person to manage circulating funds and reducing inventory, to ease the tension of funds. This has accelerated the turnover of quota circulating funds by 4 days compared to the annual plan, and several major economic indicators such as commodity sales revenue and total profit have achieved the effect of completing half of the task in half of the time.

    职工以主人翁姿态为企业分忧
    “双增双节”在太钢奏效
    中央驻沈百余企业持续开展“双增双节”
    本报太原8月7日电　记者王艾生报道：太原钢铁公司6万余名职工在煤炭、电力、原材料紧缺的情况下，同心协力，共度难关，开展“双增双节”，今年1至6月共取得3000余万元的效益。从1983年以来，通过这一活动累计创效益3.1亿余元。
    太钢是我国最大的特种钢生产基地。今年以来，全公司职工面对困难，不等不靠，以主人翁姿态，与企业共荣衰，取得令人瞩目的效益。三钢厂等在确保质量的前提下，采取“定额用料”、“不规格供料”等方式，今年上半年节约镍料45吨，降低不锈钢冶炼成本310万元。
    太钢职工围绕生产薄弱环节，组织生产技术攻关。3号高炉是太钢最大的高炉（容积1200立方米），因炉缸冷却板水温差升高，日产生铁降到1870吨，直接影响全公司的生产。由工人、技术人员和领导干部组成的攻关小组采取“特护”方法，使这座高炉的日产量升为2100吨。
    太钢职工今年上半年提合理化建议7665条，被采纳4243条，已付诸实施898条，实施建议后创造经济效益1280万元。二轧厂轧制工段司炉组提出改进加热炉板坯铁鳞板的建议，合理控制温度，使铁鳞板坯月消耗由200吨降为90吨，共节约原材料消耗费16.5万元。二钢厂电炉工段瓦工组采用粘土砖代替高铝砖，不仅提高炉衬寿命，还创出一条节约原材料的新路。
    新华社沈阳8月7日电  （记者赵文泉）今年以来，中央驻沈阳市的123户企业“双增双节”成效显著。据统计，上半年这些企业共获益8250万元，实现全年“双增双节”计划指标的82.5％。
    为了使“双增双节”活动持续深入发展，这些中央驻沈阳的企业采取了一系列有效的措施。首先，他们从形势教育入手，引导职工增强“双增双节”意识，并明确指标，层层落实。拥有3万多名职工的沈阳黎明发动机制造公司，通过各种方法向职工宣讲公司生产经营中的“喜”与“忧”，增强职工为企业排忧解难的主人翁责任感。上半年，全公司职工提出合理化建议1000多条，已实现353条，创效益1100万元。
    向科学技术要效益，降低物耗，提高生产率，是这些企业在“双增双节”中的又一项有效措施。沈阳铁路信号厂把向内挖潜的主攻目标放在提高材料和能源的利用率、减少物资消耗上。他们通过革新、自制设备，使白银、磷、铜等贵金属材料的利用率从63％提高到94％以上，年节约价值近30万元。这些企业还普遍加强了企业管理。铁路物资总公司沈阳公司为缓解资金紧张矛盾，采取设专人管理流动资金及压缩库存等6项措施，使定额流动资金周转天数比年度计划加速了4天，上半年商品销售收入、利润总额等几项主要经济指标都取得时间过半任务过半的好效果。
