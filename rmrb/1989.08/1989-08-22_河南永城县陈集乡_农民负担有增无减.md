    Chenji Town in Yongcheng County, Henan, has a population of 52,000 and 55,000 mu of arable land. In 1989, the town allocated 21 items of burdens to farmers, totaling 1.101 million yuan, with an average burden of 21.17 yuan per person and 20.02 yuan per mu of arable land. This is an increase of 10 items and 678,000 yuan compared to 1987.

    According to investigations, the main reasons for the increase in farmers' burdens are: ① There are too many unreasonable levies, and the approval procedures for various levies are not strict, with some townships and village committees arbitrarily increasing them. ② The financial management system is not sound, and the use of funds is chaotic and unclear. Every year, the broadcasting fee is increased, but the broadcasts are not heard; every year, epidemic prevention fees and water conservancy funds are collected, but no real work is done.

    The State Council has repeatedly ordered the reduction of farmers' burdens, and all sectors should support agriculture. However, some places do not follow the orders, and the burdens on farmers continue to increase, causing widespread complaints among the people.

### 河南永城县陈集乡——农民负担有增无减

    河南永城县陈集乡——
    农民负担有增无减
    永城县陈集乡有人口5.2万人，耕地面积5.5万亩，1989年乡分配农民负担共21项，总额为110.1万元，人均负担21.17元，平均每亩耕地负担20.02元，比1987年增加10项，总额增加67.8万元。
    据调查，农民负担增加的主要原因是：①不合理的摊派太多，各项提留审批程序不严，一些乡镇和行政村委随意增加。②财务收支制度不健全，经费使用混乱，去向不明。年年增收广播费，岁岁不听广播响，防疫费、水利款等年年收钱，不见办实事。
    国务院三令五申减轻农民负担，各行各业要支援农业，然而一些地方有令不行，有禁不止，我行我素，使农民负担有增无减，群众怨声载道。
