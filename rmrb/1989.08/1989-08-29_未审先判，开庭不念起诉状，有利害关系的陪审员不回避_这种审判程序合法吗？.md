**Is This Trial Procedure Legal?**

Editor,

While studying legal knowledge in practical contexts, I discovered that there are three issues with the trial process of a case in a certain county's People's Court (84) Civil Case No. 168. First, the judgment was made before the trial. The judgment was printed on May 20, 1984, but the actual trial was held on June 20. Second, during the trial, relevant personnel did not read the complaint, and until the trial ended, the defendant still did not know why the plaintiff was suing. Third, according to the Provisional Civil Procedure Law, Article 40, the defendant has the right to request the recusal of individuals with a vested interest in the case during the trial. However, an assessor with a vested interest in this case refused to recuse themselves. I would like to ask: Does the trial of this case comply with legal procedures?

Fù Yěhuī,

1. Regarding the issue of judgment before trial. The term "trial" refers to the process by which the People's Court hears and decides a case. According to the Provisional Civil Procedure Law, the main task of the trial is for the parties to present their arguments, examine evidence, question witnesses and parties, organize debates between the parties, clarify the facts of the case, and determine the nature of the case. Judgment, on the other hand, is the decision made based on the above procedures and in accordance with relevant laws. The regulations in the trial procedure indicate that the trial comes first, followed by the judgment. Only through the trial, on the basis of clarifying the facts, can a correct decision be made. If the situation you mentioned is true, where the county court printed the judgment first and then held the trial a month later, it obviously violates the trial procedure.

2. Regarding the issue of delivering the complaint to the defendant. Delivering a copy of the complaint to the defendant is a procedural action of the People's Court and an important aspect of implementing the principle of debate and protecting the defendant's right to defend. Therefore, Article 86 of the Provisional Civil Procedure Law stipulates: "In cases involving the recovery of alimony, support, child support, funeral expenses, and labor remuneration, the People's Court shall, within 5 days of acceptance, send a copy of the complaint to the defendant; the defendant shall submit a defense within 10 days of receipt. For other cases, a copy of the complaint shall be sent to the defendant within 5 days of acceptance; the defendant shall submit a defense within 15 days of receipt." Complaints can be in written or oral form. If the People's Court neither sends a copy of the complaint to the defendant within the prescribed time limit nor orally informs the defendant of the content of the complaint (if the original complaint is oral), the People's Court has violated the aforementioned provisions of the Civil Procedure Law. Submitting a defense is a right of the defendant. Whether the defendant exercises this right is up to the defendant. The defendant not submitting a defense does not affect the normal judicial activities of the People's Court. If the court does not allow the plaintiff to read the complaint at the initial hearing, it is also a violation of the trial procedure.

3. Regarding the issue of recusal. Recusal is an important institution in civil proceedings. The purpose of implementing the recusal system is to enhance the authority of the People's Court, dispel the doubts of the parties, genuinely guarantee the parties' litigation rights, ensure the proper implementation of the law, and prevent the members of the collegial panel, interpreters, and appraisers from using their power for personal gain, or from favoring one side while suppressing the other, to ensure the fair handling of the case. Therefore, Article 40 of the Provisional Civil Procedure Law stipulates the recusal system. In the trial of a case, if a person who should recuse themselves according to the law does not do so, regardless of the reason, it is a violation of the legal provisions on the recusal system.

Recusal has two forms: First, the members of the collegial panel, interpreters, and appraisers, as well as those specified by law, voluntarily recuse themselves from participating in the trial of the case, known as voluntary recusal. Second, the parties to the case, based on the legal conditions for recusal, request the recusal of one or more members of the collegial panel, clerks, interpreters, and appraisers, known as applied recusal.

Recusal is conditional. The law stipulates that if a judge, clerk, interpreter, or appraiser is a party to the case or a close relative of a party; has a vested interest in the case; or has other relationships with the parties that may affect the fair handling of the case, they should recuse themselves.

The above three conditions for recusal are based on the possibility of affecting the fair handling of the case. If there is no such possibility, even if the relationship is that of an old superior, subordinate, classmate, or friend, there is no need for recusal. It is neither necessary nor will it affect the normal progress of judicial work to recuse someone just because a party requests it without proper analysis. If that assessor falls under the first two situations stipulated by law for recusal, and your request for recusal was not adopted by your county court, then the county court is wrong; if it falls under the third situation, where the assessor has other relationships with the case and may indeed affect the fair handling of the case, and the county court did not adopt your request for recusal, then the county court is wrong. Otherwise, if the court did not accept your recusal request, it did not violate the legal provisions.

### 未审先判，开庭不念起诉状，有利害关系的陪审员不回避  这种审判程序合法吗？

    未审先判，开庭不念起诉状，有利害关系的陪审员不回避
    这种审判程序合法吗？编辑同志：
    在结合实际学习法律知识中，我发现某县人民法院（84）法民字第168号判决书判决的案件在审理过程中有3个问题。第一，未审先判。这份判决书是1984年5月20日打印的，而这一案件实际是6月20日开庭审理的。第二，开庭时有关人员不宣读起诉状，直到审理结束，被告还不知原告为何起诉？第三，根据民事诉讼法（试行）第四十条规定，在审理案件时被告有权要求对本案有利害关系的人员回避。但与此案有利害关系的陪审员却拒绝回避。请问：这一案件的审判符合法律程序吗？
                      贵州德江县统计局　付冶辉付冶辉同志：
    一、关于未审先判问题。审判是人民法院对案件进行审理和判决的总称。根据民事诉讼法（试行）的规定，审理的主要任务是当事人陈述，审查证据，询问证人和案件当事人，组织当事人进行辩论，查清案件事实，分清案件性质。判决，则是在上述基础上，根据有关法律规定，对案件作出处理决定。审判程序上的这些规定说明，审理在先，判决在后。只有通过审理，在查清事实的前提下，才能作出正确的裁决。你来信所说的县法院先打印好了判决书，一个月后才开庭审理，如情况属实，显然违反了审判程序。
    二、关于向被告送达起诉状的问题。向被告送达起诉状副本，这是人民法院的诉讼行为，也是贯彻辩论原则，保护被告答辩权的重要方面。因此，民事诉讼法（试行）第86条规定：“人民法院对追索赡养费、扶养费、抚育费、抚恤金和劳动报酬的案件，应当在受理后5日内将起诉状副本发送被告；被告在收到后10日内提出答辩状。其他案件起诉状副本，应当在受理后5日内发送被告；被告在收到后15日内提出答辩状。”起诉状有书面和口头之分。如果人民法院既未依法定时效向被告发送起诉状副本，又未口头告知（如原告诉状是口头的）被告诉状内容，人民法院即违反了民事诉讼法的上述规定。提出答辩状这是被告的诉讼权利。被告是否行使答辩权由自己决定。被告不提出答辩状，不影响人民法院的正常审判活动。开庭初审时，如法庭不让原告宣读起诉状，也是违反审判程序的。
    三、关于回避问题。回避是民事诉讼中一项重要制度。实行回避制度的目的，在于提高人民法院的威信，解除当事人的疑虑，切实保证当事人的诉讼权利，保证法律的正当实施，防止合议庭组成人员、翻译、监定人员以权谋私，或者偏袒一方，压制一方，确保案件的公正处理。因此，民事诉讼法（试行）第40条规定了回避制度。在审理案件中，依法应当回避而没有回避的人员，不管出于什么原因，都是违反法律关于回避制度规定的。
    回避有两种：一是合议庭人员、翻译、监定人员，还有法律规定的回避原因，主动回避参与本案审理，名曰自动回避。二是案件双方当事人根据法律规定的回避条件，向合议庭提出审判人员、书记员、翻译和监定人中某一人或某几人回避，这叫申请回避。
    回避是有条件的。法律规定，审判员、书记员、翻译人员和监定人是本案当事人或者是当事人的近亲属；与本案有利害关系的；与本案当事人有其他关系，可能影响对案件公正处理的，都应回避。
    上述3方面回避条件，前提是可能影响案件的公正处理。如果没有这种可能，即使老上级、老部下、同学、朋友关系，也没有必要回避。不加分析的只要当事人提出回避，就必须回避，既没有必要，也会影响审判工作的正常进行。如果那位陪审员属于法律规定的回避条件前两种情况，你提出回避，而未被你县法院采纳，县法院是不对的；如果是属于第三种情况，这位陪审员与本案有其他关系，而且确实可能影响本案的公正处理，县法院没有采纳你让他回避的要求，县法院是不对的。否则，法院未予接受你提出的回避申请，并没有违反法律的规定。　          本报法律顾问团
