The population problem is a major issue that has attracted global attention. Recently, the United Nations Population Fund released its latest predictions, stating that by the year 2100, the global population will reach 14.2 billion. This once again sounds the alarm for the world about the rapid increase in population. Some scholars studying global environmental issues believe that if the Earth's population really expands to that extent, the consequences will be disastrous.

Since the beginning of this century, Western economists and demographers have long been engaged in the study of the "optimal population" theory, proposing that a country or region should determine the appropriate population size and growth rate based on multiple factors such as geographical environment, natural resources, and economic development levels, in order to maintain the stability of the ecosystem.

Facts have shown that the sudden increase in the world's population is not only the main cause of crises in global ecology, resources, energy, and food shortages, but also affects the economic development of a country and even the entire world.

Population pressure has caused serious concern in countries around the world. It is particularly worth noting that developing countries should pay more attention to solving population problems. Recently, a research report from the Federal Republic of Germany estimated that the world's population will increase by 80 million people each year, of which 70 million will be born in developing countries. Therefore, population has become a major problem for developing countries. The widening gap between the economies of the North and the South is an important reason. Currently, developed countries account for 80% of the world's total social output value, but their population accounts for only 20% of the world's total. A report by the World Bank pointed out that the rapid population growth in developing countries (annual growth rate of more than 2%) seriously hinders their economic growth and improvement of living standards.

Today, the United Nations Population Fund once again calls for reducing the population growth rate and ultimately stabilizing the world's population at 10.2 billion. Achieving this goal is not easy, but it is also not impossible. The fund's research report believes that if the needs for various family planning measures (funds, contraceptives, technology, etc.) can be met now, then Latin America will have 35% fewer births, Asia will have 33% fewer, and Africa will have 27% fewer. These figures are enough to show that the population growth rate can be completely controlled through family planning, but the key is to start now, rather than waiting until the next century to take action. Otherwise, it will be too late by then.

    警钟长鸣
    ——小议世界人口问题
    卢继传
    人口问题是当今举世瞩目的大问题。不久前，联合国人口基金会公布了最新预测，到2100年全球人口将达到142亿。这就又一次向全世界敲响了人口激增的警钟。一些研究全球环境问题的学者认为，地球上的人口如果真的膨胀到那种程度，其后果将是灾难性的。
    从本世纪初开始，西方经济学家、人口学家就长期从事“适度人口”理论的研究，提出一个国家或一个地区应依据地理环境、自然资源和经济发展水平等多项条件，来决定适当的人口数量和增长速度，以维护生态系统的稳定。
    事实表明，世界人口的骤增，不仅是引起所谓世界生态、资源、能源等方面危机和粮食短缺的主要原因，而且影响到一个国家以至整个世界经济的发展。
    人口压力已引起世界各国的严重关切。特别需要指出的是，发展中国家更应当重视解决人口问题。不久前，联邦德国一份研究报告估计：世界人口每年将增加8000万人，其中有7000万人将出生在发展中国家。因此，人口已成了发展中国家的一大难题。南北经济差距不断扩大，这是一个重要原因。目前，发达国家的总产值占世界社会总产值的80％，但其人口仅占世界的20％。世界银行的一个报告曾指出，发展中国家的人口迅速增长（每年增长2％以上），严重阻碍了它的经济增长和人民生活水平的提高。
    今天，联合国人口基金会再次发出呼吁，降低人口增长率，最终把世界人口稳定在102亿。达到这个目标不容易，但也并非不能实现。该会研究报告认为，如果现在各类计划生育的需要（资金、节育用具、技术等）能够得到满足的话，那么拉丁美洲将少出生人口35％，亚洲会少生33％，非洲会少生27％。这些数字足以表明，通过计划生育，人口增长速度是完全可以控制的，但问题在于，要从现在开始，而不是到下个世纪才行动起来，否则，到了那个时候就太晚了。
