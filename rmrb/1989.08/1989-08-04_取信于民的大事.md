Now, it is the season for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products.

Enthusiastic farmers, under the scorching summer sun, have delivered to the procurement departments sacks of grain, bundles of wool, piles of wood ear mushrooms, and fat pigs...

In previous years, farmers were mainly concerned about the procurement prices of agricultural and sideline products. Since last autumn, farmers have been most afraid of the phenomenon of only accepting products, issuing IOUs, and not paying cash, which results in "white slips."

Farmers eagerly hand over their labor fruits to the state, which is both a necessity for the country's modernization construction and a need for farmers to expand their production. They need to exchange their agricultural and sideline products for cash to buy fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and daily necessities. If what they get in return is not cash but "white slips," how can they develop production and arrange their lives?

Last year, due to some problems in our financial work, many places issued "white slips" during the autumn grain procurement, which, although it reduced some currency issuance, harmed the material interests of the farmers, damaged the relationship between the Party and the government with the farmers, and affected the credibility of the financial departments. No wonder the farmers complained bitterly and had many objections, which affected the subsequent rural procurement work. Indeed, losing the trust of the people is a costly mistake!

The reasons for the "white slips" phenomenon are many, but the main one is the shortage of funds. Therefore, to overcome the "white slips" phenomenon, we must spare no effort to open up financial resources. This year, the Agricultural Bank of China and the People's Bank of China have increased loans for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Local authorities should also take effective measures to raise procurement funds in every possible way, eliminate "white slips," support agriculture, and win the trust of the people.

For the behavior of diverting procurement funds for other uses, regardless of who decided it and regardless of how many reasons are given to justify it, it must be resolutely investigated and exposed to the public. We must not allow any actions that harm the interests of the farmers to succeed.

    取信于民的大事
    现在，正值农副产品的收购时节。
    热情的农民，顶着夏阳酷暑，向收购部门送去了一袋袋粮食、一包包羊绒、一堆堆木耳、一头头肥猪……
    往年，农民多是关心农副产品的收购价格；从去年秋季以来，农民又最怕出现只收购、打欠条、不给钱的白条子现象。
    农民踊跃向国家交售自己的劳动果实，既是国家四化建设的需要，也是农民自己扩大再生产的需要。他们要通过农副产品的收购，换取现金，然后再去买化肥、种子、农药以及生活必需品。如果他们换来的不是现金而是一张张白条子，让他们怎样去发展生产、安排生活？
    去年，由于我们金融工作中有一些问题，不少地方在秋季粮食收购时打了白条子，看起来虽然减少了一些货币投放，但却侵害了农民的物质利益，损害了党和政府同农民的关系，影响了金融部门的信誉。难怪农民叫苦不迭、意见顿起，以致影响此后的农村收购工作。真是失信于民，得不偿失！
    出现白条子现象的原因很多，但主要还是资金短缺。所以，要克服白条子现象，必须千方百计开辟财源。今年，中国农业银行和中国人民银行已经增加了农副产品收购的贷款。各地也应采取得力措施，千方百计筹集收购资金，消灭白条，扶持农业，取信于民。
    对于把收购资金挪作它用的行为，不管是谁决定的，不管摆出多少理由辩解，都要坚决查处，昭示于众，绝不能让侵害农民利益的事情得逞。
