The waters of the Lower Danube are getting warmer day by day, and the grass on the banks is turning greener. Amidst the vibrant colors, a "Vienna Weekend Market" has quietly appeared. After a winter's rest, it has revived along with all things in the beautiful spring light.

There are no dazzling display windows, no flashy decorations. Along the banks of the Lower Danube, large and small stalls present a strange world to the visitors.

Here, seemingly faded items might suddenly shine brightly when they meet a connoisseur. Those old-fashioned clocks that seem to "take three steps forward and four steps back," those jewelry pieces covered in dust from the passage of time, broken violins, incomplete porcelain sculptures—who knows when they might suddenly turn lucky? The prices of antiques are naturally surprising, but there is room for negotiation. Some stalls have signs that openly say "Prices are negotiable," and the stall owners leisurely wait for their customers.

Under a large tree, we saw a young woman holding a silver thread, skillfully cutting and wrapping it with both hands. In a short while, she made a delicate earring. We chatted with her, and it turned out that she was a university student majoring in engineering. Making earrings was her hobby. With just a silver thread and a pair of pliers, she had already made several hundred pairs of earrings, all designed by herself. We casually complimented her on the star and moon design, and she immediately squatted down to make another pair, saying, "You can't come all this way for nothing, you should take a souvenir." When she handed us the newly made star and moon earrings, she casually quoted the price: 150 schillings (about 12 dollars).

There are more onlookers than buyers. However, some stalls can meet one or two customers a day, which is enough. Some stall owners seem indifferent, making one feel that they are not really doing business.

The busiest stall is under the big bridge, run by an old man. He doesn't sell gold or silver; he specializes in selling stones. There are jade-green, intricately patterned malachite, blood-red, oil-painted-like heliotrope, blue-green with occasional black spots serpentine… The pendants made from these stones are even more popular, and many young men accompany their beloved girls to choose from them.

The stall owner told us that his stone materials come from South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and some from Europe. Don't underestimate these stones; some necklaces can be sold at the price of gold.

This weekend market also values food culture. Here, if you get tired from walking around, you can eat Vienna-style pork chops, fried sausages, hot dogs; if you want to drink, there is coffee, milk, champagne infused with strawberries and peaches. You can sit by the small tables by the river, listen to music, eat, and chat.

    维也纳周末市场
    张鹤　周国勇
    下多瑙河水一天比一天暖了，岸边的草坪一天比一天绿了。姹紫嫣红中悄没声儿地出现了一个“维也纳周末市场”。歇了一冬，它随着万物在大好春光中复苏了。
    没有绚丽的橱窗，没有炫目的装璜，下多瑙河畔，大大小小的摊位向人们展示出一个奇异的世界。
    在这里，看似黯然失色的东西一旦遇到行家，也许会顿放异彩。那些“快三步、慢四步”的老式钟表，那些蒙着岁月风尘的首饰，断了弦的破提琴，残缺不全的瓷雕，说不定什么时候就会时来运转。古董标价自然令人吃惊，但不无商量余地。有的摊前公然竖着“可以讨价还价”的木牌，摊主悠然等待着他的顾客。
    在一棵大树下，我们看到一位姑娘牵一根银丝，两只手灵巧地不断剪着、绕着，一会儿功夫便做出一只精致的耳坠。
    我们和她交谈起来，原来她是个学理工的大学生，做耳坠是她的业余爱好。凭一根银线、一把钳子，她已经做出几百副耳坠，款式都是她自己设计的。我们随口夸赞说那副星星月亮的好，她就又蹲下去做，边做边说：“你们不能白来一趟，要留点纪念品。”当她把新做好的星星月亮耳坠递给我们时才轻松地报了价：150先令（约12美元）。
    看客自然比买主多。可是有些摊位一天能遇上一两个主顾也就足矣。有些摊主则漫不经心，使人感到他们似乎不是在做买卖。
    生意最兴隆的当推大桥下面那个老先生。他不卖金不卖银，专卖石头。翠绿的、花纹绰约的孔雀石，腥红的、油彩点染般的鸡血石，蓝中泛绿的、偶现黑点的松石……用它们制成的项链坠子更受欢迎，不少小伙子陪心爱的姑娘挑选。
    摊主人告诉我们，他的石头原料来自南非、巴西、墨西哥，也有些来自欧洲。别小瞧这些石头，有的项链能卖到黄金的价格呢。
    这个周末市场也讲究饮食文化。在这里，逛累了，要吃，有维也纳烤猪排、煎香肠、热狗；要喝，有咖啡、牛奶、浸了草莓和黄桃的香槟酒。你可以坐在河边的小桌旁听音乐，边吃边聊。
