The Life of Comrade Burhan Shahidi

A loyal communist warrior, a great patriot, a renowned social activist, an outstanding representative of the Uyghur people, a vice-chairman of the Sixth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the honorary president of the Islamic Association of China, Comrade Burhan Shahidi passed away in Beijing on August 27, 1989, at the age of 95 due to illness.

Comrade Burhan Shahidi, originally from Aksu, Xinjiang, was born in Russia in 1894 and returned to Xinjiang in 1912. In his early years, he worked as an apprentice, shop assistant, customs tax inspector, and the first director of the Dihua (Urumqi) Automobile Bureau. In the 1930s, he served as a member of the Xinjiang Provincial Planning Commission and the Consul-General of the National Government in the Soviet Union. From 1945 to 1949, he held positions such as Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department, Director of the Dihua Special District, Vice-Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, Member of the National Government, and Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government. In September 1949, he, along with General Tao Zhiyue, issued a proclamation to rebel. After the rebellion, he served as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and concurrently as the President of the Xinjiang Higher People's Court, a Standing Committee Member of the CPC Central Committee's Xinjiang Branch, and a Member of the Northwest Military and Political Committee. After 1953, he held important positions such as Vice-Chairman of the Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, President and Honorary President of the Islamic Association of China, and Deputy Chairman of the National Committee of the First, Second, and Third National People's Congresses, and Deputy Chairman of the National Committee of the First and Second National People's Congresses.

Comrade Burhan Shahidi's life was one of revolution. Born into a poor family, he experienced brutal national oppression and class exploitation. In his youth, he developed a rebellious spirit against the old system. In 1929, he studied in Germany and was exposed to Marxism. During his studies, he visited the Soviet Union several times, witnessing the great achievements of socialist construction, and initially established his belief in Marxism-Leninism and socialism. In 1933, he joined a revolutionary organization in the Soviet Union and soon returned to Xinjiang to engage in underground revolutionary struggles. In 1935, he joined the Xinjiang People's Anti-Imperialist United Front and served as the Deputy Director of the People's Department. The following year, he became the Acting Vice-Chairman of the organization. During this period, he befriended Yu Xiusong, a member of the Communist Party of China who was then the Chairman of the organization, and learned about the Party's struggle history, line, and policies. From then on, he developed an infinite respect and love for the Communist Party of China. In 1939, while imprisoned by Sheng Shicai, he endured torture and wrote a Uyghur poem titled "High Respect to Mao Zedong," which said: "I am a star illuminated by your brilliance, fighting with sincere will on the path you have opened. No matter how fierce the storms or how violent the earthquakes, they cannot extinguish the torch of my boundless love for you in my heart." He used this to inspire himself to fight against the reactionaries. In 1944, the "Three Districts Revolution" against the Kuomintang reactionary rule broke out in Ili, Tacheng, and Altay in Xinjiang. In 1946, he was elected as the Vice-Chairman of the Xinjiang United Government by the representatives of the "Three Districts Revolution." In 1949, inspired by the great victories of the People's Liberation Army, he actively planned for a peaceful uprising in Xinjiang. In September, he and General Tao Zhiyue issued a proclamation to rebel, achieving the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. Soon after, he was introduced by Wang Zhen and Xu Licheng to join the Communist Party of China and served as a Standing Committee Member of the CPC Central Committee's Xinjiang Branch. Thereafter, he strictly demanded of himself as a communist warrior, and even when faced with extremely unfair treatment, or during the adversity of the Cultural Revolution, he never wavered in his belief in the Party and its cause.

Comrade Burhan Shahidi's life was one of struggle for the unity of the motherland and national unity, and for the development, prosperity, and progress of all ethnic groups. In the 1920s, he organized a secret organization with some like-minded Uyghur youth to fight against national oppression. In the following decades, Burhan Shahidi firmly supported and participated in the struggle of the Xinjiang people against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and resolutely opposed all activities aimed at splitting the motherland. In the 1940s, he said: "For more than two thousand years, Xinjiang has been a part of China. Xinjiang is not the Xinjiang of a single ethnic group but the Xinjiang of all ethnic groups, just as China is not the China of a single ethnic group but the China of all ethnic groups." After the founding of New China, while serving as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and a Member of the Northwest Nationalities Affairs Committee, he worked tirelessly under the leadership of the Party Central Committee to build and develop Xinjiang, promoting the economic and cultural development of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Later, he served as the Deputy Chairman of the National Committee of the National People's Congress and the President of the Islamic Association of China, conscientiously implementing the Party's policies on ethnic and religious affairs. At the Eighth National Congress of the Party, his speech on ethnic and religious policies was praised by central leaders. Even in his later years, he was deeply concerned about the construction of Xinjiang and national unity.

Comrade Burhan Shahidi made important contributions to promoting friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world, especially the Islamic countries, and to maintaining world peace. After the founding of New China, he served as the President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, the President of the China-Arab Friendship Association, the Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Vice-Chairman of the China-Asian-African Solidarity Committee, the Vice-President of the China-Africa People's Friendship Association, and the Vice-President of the China-Asian-African Society. As a peace envoy of the Chinese people, he visited more than a dozen countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe and participated in several international peace conferences. In his diplomatic activities, he consistently upheld China's independent and peaceful foreign policy, enthusiastically promoted China's ethnic and religious policies, and promoted mutual understanding and friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the peoples of other countries.

Comrade Burhan Shahidi was a distinguished Uyghur scholar. Due to his poor family background, Burhan Shahidi did not receive formal education in his childhood, but he was diligent in self-study and strived for progress. In 1929, he was admitted to the Department of Political Economy at the University of Berlin. He mastered multiple languages and scripts, including Uyghur, Chinese, Russian, German, and Turkish. Later, while imprisoned by Sheng Shicai, he compiled the "Uyghur-Chinese-Russian Dictionary" with indomitable will and translated Sun Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People" into Uyghur. He also had extensive research on the history of Xinjiang and Western Asia. In response to some erroneous views circulating in academic and social circles, he published articles such as "On the Alashan Regime" in 1952, which were affirmed by Chairman Mao. Before liberation, Burhan Shahidi had twice served as the President of Xinjiang Academy. After the founding of New China, he served as a member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Director of the Institute of Ethnic Languages, Director of the Institute of Ethnic Studies, President of the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, President of Xinjiang University, and Vice-President of the Chinese Society of Law. His works include the memoir "Fifty Years in Xinjiang" and the play "The Roar of the Flame Mountain."

Comrade Burhan Shahidi's life was one of pursuing light, truth, and progress. He was frugal, honest, strict with himself, and lenient with others. He always loved his motherland and ethnic group and was loyal to the cause of the Party and the people. He adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely supported the line, principles, and policies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Comrade Burhan Shahidi dedicated his life to maintaining national unity and the cause of the Party.

    包尔汉同志生平
    忠诚的共产主义战士、伟大的爱国者、著名的社会活动家、维吾尔族人民的杰出代表、第六届全国政协副主席、中国伊斯兰教协会名誉会长包尔汉同志因病于1989年8月27日在北京逝世，终年95岁。
    包尔汉同志，祖籍新疆阿克苏，1894年出生于俄国，1912年回到新疆。早年在迪化（乌鲁木齐）当过学徒、店员、海关关税检查委员、迪化第一任汽车局长。30年代曾任新疆省设计委员会委员、国民政府驻苏联斋桑领事。1945年至1949年，曾任新疆省民政厅副厅长，迪化专区专员，新疆省政府副主席，国民政府委员、新疆省政府主席。1949年9月，他同陶峙岳将军一起通电起义。起义后，他曾任新疆省人民政府主席兼省高等人民法院院长、中共中央新疆分局常委、西北军政委员会委员。1953年后，他担任过中国人民政治协商会议第二、三、五、六届全国委员会副主席，政协新疆维吾尔自治区委员会主席，中国伊斯兰教协会主任、名誉会长，第一、二、三届全国人大代表，第一、二届全国人大民族委员会副主任委员等要职。
    包尔汉同志的一生，是革命的一生。他出身于一个贫苦的家庭，经受了残酷的民族压迫和阶级剥削，青年时代就产生了对旧制度的反抗思想。1929年，他留学德国，接触了马克思主义。留学期间，他曾数次去苏联，目睹了苏联社会主义建设的巨大成就，初步树立了对马克思列宁主义和社会主义的信念。1933年他在苏联参加了革命组织，不久即回到新疆从事地下革命斗争。1935年，他参加了新疆民众反帝联合会，任民众部副部长，次年又任该会代理副委员长。在此期间，他结识了当时任该会会长的中共党员俞秀松，交情日笃，并对中国共产党的斗争历史和路线、政策有所了解，从此他对中国共产党产生了无限的崇敬和热爱。1939年他在盛世才的监狱里，饱受折磨，曾写下一首维吾尔文诗《崇高的敬意献给毛泽东》，诗中说：“我是一颗由您的光辉照亮的星，用真诚的意志为您开辟的道路而奋斗。无论狂风暴雨、山崩地裂，都扑不灭我心中对您无限热爱的火炬。”他以此来激励自己同反动派进行斗争。1944年，在新疆伊犁、塔城、阿勒泰爆发了反对国民党反动派统治的“三区革命”。1946年他被“三区革命”的代表推举为新疆联合政府副主席。1949年，他深受人民解放军巨大胜利的鼓舞，积极在新疆筹划和平起义。9月，他和陶峙岳将军一起通电起义，实现了新疆的和平解放。不久，他由王震、徐立清同志介绍加入了中国共产党，并任中共中央新疆分局常委。此后，他以一个共产主义战士的标准严格要求自己，即使遭受到极不公正待遇，甚至在“文化大革命”那样的逆境中，他也没有动摇过对党和党的事业的信念。
    包尔汉同志的一生，是为维护祖国统一和民族团结、为各民族的发展、繁荣和进步奋斗的一生。20年代，他与维吾尔族青年中的一些有志之士组织了一个争取民族解放的秘密组织，开展了反对民族压迫的斗争。在以后的几十年中，包尔汉同志坚定不移地支持、参加了新疆人民反对帝国主义、反对国民党反动统治的斗争，同时旗帜鲜明地反对一切企图分裂祖国的活动。在40年代，他曾说：“新疆两千多年以来就是中国的一个组成部分。新疆不是一个民族的新疆而是各民族的新疆，正如中国不是一个民族的中国而是各民族的中国一样。”新中国成立后，他在担任新疆省人民政府主席、西北民族事务委员会委员时，在党中央的领导下，为建设新疆、开发新疆，促进新疆各民族经济文化的发展，不辞劳苦，辛勤工作，作出了积极的贡献。以后，他又担任了全国人大民委副主任委员、中国伊斯兰教协会主任，认真贯彻党的民族、宗教政策。在党的第八次全国代表大会上，他就民族、宗教政策问题的发言受到中央领导同志的称赞。直到晚年，他还十分关心新疆的建设和民族团结。
    包尔汉同志为增进中国人民同世界人民特别是伊斯兰国家人民的友谊，为维护世界和平作出了重要贡献。新中国成立后，他担任过中国印尼友好协会会长、中国阿联友好协会会长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席、中国亚非团结委员会副主席、中国非洲人民友好协会副会长、中国亚非学会副会长等职。作为中国人民的和平使者，他曾出访了亚、非、欧十几个国家，多次参加了国际性的和平会议。在对外交往活动中，他始终坚持了我国独立自主的和平外交政策，热情宣传了我国的民族宗教政策，促进了中国人民和世界各国人民相互了解和友好往来。
    包尔汉同志是一位卓有成就的维吾尔族学者。由于家境贫寒，包尔汉同志幼年时没有受到正规的教育，但他刻苦自学，奋发向上。1929年他考入柏林大学政经系。他掌握了维、汉、俄、德、土耳其等多种语言文字，后来在盛世才的监狱里，他以顽强的毅力编纂了《维汉俄词典》，并将孙中山的《三民主义》一书译成维吾尔文。他对新疆和西亚的历史也颇有研究。针对学术界和社会上流传的一些错误观点，他在1952年发表了《论阿古柏政权》等论文，得到了毛主席的肯定。包尔汉同志在解放前曾两度出任新疆学院院长。新中国成立后，他担任过中国科学院哲学社会科学部学部委员、民族语言研究所所长、民族研究所所长、中科院新疆分院院长、新疆大学校长、中国政法学会副会长。他的著作还有回忆录《新疆五十年》、剧本《火焰山的怒吼》等。
    包尔汉同志的一生，是追求光明、追求真理、追求进步的一生。他艰苦朴素，廉洁奉公，严于律己，宽以待人。他始终热爱自己的祖国和民族，始终忠于党和人民的事业。他坚持四项基本原则，坚决拥护党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策。包尔汉同志为维护祖国统一、民族团结，为党的事业贡献了毕生精力。
