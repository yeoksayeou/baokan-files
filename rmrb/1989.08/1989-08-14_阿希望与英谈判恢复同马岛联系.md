Argentina's Foreign Minister Cavallo said on August 13 that Argentina hopes to restore, through negotiations, the ties with the Malvinas Islands, which were severed due to the conflict between Argentina and Britain over the islands.

Cavallo made these remarks in an interview with the Argentine newspaper *Comercio y Finanzas*. He said that negotiations are the best way to resolve differences.

He pointed out that if Argentina's sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands is respected, Argentina is willing to normalize relations with Britain.

Since the 1982 Malvinas War, relations between Argentina and Britain have been tense and hostile. Britain continues to occupy the Malvinas Islands, which Argentina considers its territory, and has established a 3,200-nautical-mile "exclusive zone" around the islands.

    阿希望与英谈判恢复同马岛联系
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯8月13日电　阿根廷外长卡瓦略13日说，阿根廷希望通过谈判同英国占领下的马尔维纳斯群岛恢复因阿、英马岛冲突而中断的联系。
    卡瓦略是在接受阿根廷《商业纪事报》采访时说这番话的。他说，谈判是解决分歧的最佳途径。
    他指出，如果阿根廷对马尔维纳斯群岛的主权要求得到尊重，阿根廷愿意同英国实现关系正常化。
    自1982年马岛战争以来，阿、英关系一直处于紧张和敌视状态。英国至今仍占领着阿根廷认为是它的领土的马尔维纳斯群岛，并在该群岛周围设置了3200海里“专属区”。
