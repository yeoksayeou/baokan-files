In the tranquil and elegant Zhongnanhai Ziguangge, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng warmly received Qian Xuesen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, this afternoon at 3:30. They enthusiastically congratulated him on receiving the "Little Rockwell Medal," "World-Class Scientist and Engineer," and "Honorary Member of the International Institute of Engineering and Technology."

This honor was bestowed upon Qian Xuesen on June 29 at the 1989 International Technology and Technology Exchange Conference held in New York, USA, in recognition of his significant pioneering contributions to China's rocket and missile technology, aerospace technology, and systems engineering theory.

General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng first posed for a photo with Qian Xuesen, followed by a pleasant conversation. General Secretary Jiang Zemin referred to Qian as his senior classmate, as they both graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1934 and 1947, respectively. Jiang Zemin then asked Li Peng to speak first.

Premier Li Peng, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, extended warm congratulations to Qian Xuesen on his achievements. He said that this honor was well-deserved, not only for Qian but also for China and its scientific and engineering community.

Li Peng mentioned that in the early 1950s, Qian Xuesen, despite numerous obstacles, crossed the ocean to return to his motherland. His journey embodied the tortuous path of a Chinese intellectual and exemplified the shining qualities of Chinese intellectuals: patriotism, loyalty to the Party, and love for the people. He had a deep love for the Chinese people, unwavering confidence in his career, and the courage to overcome all difficulties. He was steadfast and dedicated to completing his mission.

Li Peng emphasized that China is a country led by the working class. Intellectuals are part of the working class, and their mainstream is positive. Even during the recent turmoil, the majority of intellectuals and technical personnel loved the Party and the country, resisting the turmoil. In building the Four Modernizations, we must rely on the working class and fully leverage the role of intellectuals.

Li Peng also discussed the importance of developing China's defense industry. He hoped that all scientific and technological workers would learn from foreign experiences while upholding the tradition of self-reliance and hard work to advance the defense industry.

General Secretary Jiang Zemin then spoke, agreeing with Li Peng's remarks. He noted that Qian Xuesen's return to China, despite numerous difficulties, fully demonstrated his high patriotism. Some people always think that everything in foreign countries is better than in China, which is a form of self-deprecation. We should learn from Qian Xuesen, not just in academic achievements, but more importantly, in political qualities. We should learn from the older generation of scientists who have a high sense of national pride, national confidence, and national integrity.

Jiang Zemin added that currently, China's economy lags behind developed countries, but China's future is bright. China will not yield to foreign pressure. The more difficulties we face, the more we need to uphold our national spirit and do our work well. At the same time, China is a country of "rituals and righteousness." We should develop friendly relations with other countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, conduct trade and economic and technological cooperation with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and further improve our open policy.

Qian Xuesen expressed his gratitude to the Party Central Committee and the State Council for their concern. He said that as a scientist, the purpose of living is to serve the people. The highest reward is the satisfaction of the people with our work. We must love our country, support the Communist Party, and, under the leadership of the Party, do our best for the Four Modernizations.

Qian recalled with deep emotion the days when he worked on national defense research under the care of Premier Zhou Enlai and the direct command of Nie Rongzhen. He said that in some areas, we are not catching up because Chinese people are not stupid, but because we lack a rigorous organization and have not fully mobilized people's enthusiasm. He believed that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, our cause will prosper and flourish.

State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian, and leaders from the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense and the Chinese Association for Science and Technology attended the meeting.

    江泽民李鹏会见钱学森时指出
    学习老一辈科学家爱国精神
    四化建设中要依靠工人阶级也要充分发挥知识分子作用
    本报北京8月7日讯　记者何黄彪报道：在静谧典雅的中南海紫光阁，中共中央总书记江泽民、国务院总理李鹏今日下午三时半亲切会见了全国政协副主席、中国科协主席钱学森，热烈祝贺他荣获“小罗克韦尔奖章”和“世界级科技与工程名人”、“国际理工研究所名誉成员”等称号。
    这一荣誉，是今年6月29日在美国纽约召开的1989年国际技术与技术交流大会上，为表彰钱学森对中国火箭导弹技术、航天技术和系统工程理论作出重大开拓性贡献而授予的。
    江泽民总书记、李鹏总理首先同钱学森合影留念，接着进行了愉快的交谈。江泽民总书记称钱老是他的老学长，因为他俩分别在1934年和1947年毕业于上海交通大学。江泽民同志首先请李鹏同志讲话。
    李鹏总理代表党中央、国务院向钱学森所获得的荣誉表示热烈的祝贺。他说，这是当之无愧的，这不仅是钱老的光荣，也是中国的光荣，是中国科学工程技术人员的光荣。
    李鹏说，钱学森同志在50年代初期，曾冲破重重阻挠，漂洋过海，毅然回到祖国。他的经历，体现了一位中国知识分子所走过的曲折道路，也集中表现了中国知识分子的光辉品质，这就是爱国、爱党、爱人民。他对祖国人民有着深沉的爱，对自己的事业充满了胜利的信心，充满了克服一切困难的勇气，并且为完成这一事业锲而不舍，竭尽全力。
    李鹏说，中国是以工人阶级为领导的国家，知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，他们的主流是好的，就是在这次动乱中，绝大多数知识分子、工程技术人员热爱党、热爱国家，抵制了动乱。我们在建设四化的过程中，要依靠工人阶级，也要充分发挥知识分子的作用。
    李鹏在谈话中还谈到发展我国国防工业的重要性。他希望广大科技工作者在吸收国外经验的同时，发挥自力更生、艰苦奋斗的传统，把国防工业搞上去。
    接着，江泽民总书记讲话。他说，完全同意李鹏同志讲话。当年钱老冲破重重困难，远涉重洋回归祖国，充分体现了高度的爱国主义精神。现在有的人总觉得外国什么都比中国好，这是妄自菲薄。我们学习钱学森同志，不光要在学术方面，更重要的是在政治品质方面。要学习老一辈科学家那种高尚的民族自尊心、民族自信心和民族气节。
    江泽民还说，目前，中国的经济同发达国家相比，还有较大差距，但中国的前途是光明的。中国绝不屈服外国的压力。越是困难，越要发扬我们的民族精神，越要把我们的工作搞好。同时，中国又是“礼义之邦”，我们要在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展同各国的友好关系，在平等互利的基础上与各国进行贸易往来和经济技术合作，进一步搞好对外开放。
    钱学森同志感谢党中央、国务院的关心。他说，作为一名科学家，活着的目的就是为人民服务，人民对我们工作满意的话，那就是最高的奖赏。我们一定要爱国、拥护共产党，在党的领导下，为四化建设竭尽全力。
    钱老还深情地回忆了在周总理的关怀下，在聂荣臻同志的直接指挥下，进行国防科研工作的情景。他说，现在某些方面赶不上去，不是因为中国人笨，而是我们缺乏严密的组织，没有更好地把人的积极性发挥出来。他相信，在党中央领导下，我们的事业会越来越兴旺发达。
    国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健、国防科工委和中国科协的负责人参加了会见。
