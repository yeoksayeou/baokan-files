Title: How Do We Become Consumers

In recent years, many people have felt a sense of bewilderment as consumers. In the past, brands like Wang Ma's scissors, Yongkang, and Flying Pigeon were renowned for decades. However, today, some products that are popular today might become obsolete tomorrow. In the past, housewives could easily calculate the prices of items they needed without leaving home. Today, many products fluctuate in price, rising and falling unpredictably, and new styles come out so quickly that it's hard to keep up—jackets, T-shirts, and polo shirts, for example. The market is dizzying!

Consumers accustomed to a planned economy suddenly find themselves in a market with commercial characteristics, and it's enough to make anyone dizzy. But since we've entered the market, we have to adapt to it.

Consumption Also Requires Thinking

In the past, we would go into a store, see what we liked, and buy it without haggling, because the price was the same everywhere. Today, things are different. A pair of Lion brand trousers might cost 21 yuan at one stall, 23 yuan at another, and 25 yuan somewhere else. People complain: "It's understandable that individual vendors don't have fixed prices, but why do state-run stores have different prices for the same item?" This mindset is based on past perceptions of state-run stores. In reality, with more distribution channels and some product prices deregulated, even state-run stores might have different prices for the same item. Moreover, today's state-run stores are often leased or contracted out, making it difficult to view them through old lenses.

Since many products no longer have a uniform price and this has its rationality, consumers need to think more. If you buy a low-quality product at a high price, it's important to learn from the experience rather than just blaming society.

On March 15th, which is "World Consumer Rights Day," staff from the China Consumer Association went out to promote consumer knowledge and sell the book "How to Identify Counterfeit and Substandard Products." One person was upset about this: "You don't need to promote anything; just stop factories from making counterfeit and substandard products!" In the past, people didn't understand consumption, but they still lived fine. We should remind ourselves that this was purely a planned economy. In places where the commodity economy is developed, consumers must have the necessary product knowledge to protect their own interests.

How to consume according to one's income is a skill. According to economists' research, low-income families spend most of their consumption on food; middle-income families reduce the proportion spent on food and increase spending on goods; in high-income families, the proportion spent on goods decreases, and the proportion spent on entertainment increases. Statistics show that the overall income of urban residents in China is low. However, even families with modest incomes are buying high-end durable consumer goods, causing financial strain at home and shortages of certain goods in the market.

Developing a Healthy Consumption Mindset

Why do low-income families buy high-end consumer goods? It's because urban residents enjoy a lot of subsidies for housing, medical care, transportation, water, electricity, and some food, reducing their spending in these areas. In today's developing commodity economy, reform in these areas remains a challenging and sensitive issue.

A young woman about to get married was furious when she saw her fiancé arrive in a van to pick her up. She refused to get in, saying, "Everyone else gets married in a limousine, so does that make me inferior?" The fiancé, already in debt, had to pay a high price to rent a limousine for the day.

Consumption is multi-tiered. The lowest level of consumption is for survival, but the higher the consumption, the more it focuses on enjoyment and psychological satisfaction. Of course, consumption has temporal characteristics. For example, the era of picking up brides on bicycles has passed, and perhaps now is the era of brides riding in limousines. However, for each specific consumer, there are different economic conditions. When pursuing a certain level of consumption, one must consider: does your economic basis allow you to truly enjoy and be psychologically satisfied with this pursuit? To compare with others and spend recklessly on one marriage, is there any enjoyment or satisfaction in that? Besides, those who buy clothes just because others do will always be vulgar. Consumption should also have personality. One should not compare who spends more money, but who spends it more wisely. "High consumers" are not necessarily "high-level consumers."

Consumption competition is a psychological vanity where people do not dare to face or intentionally hide their economic income.

    我们怎样做消费者
    王清宪
    这几年，作为一个消费者，不少人都有些茫然。过去说王麻子的剪刀好，一好就是几十年，永久、飞鸽也是独领风骚数十年；可如今，有些商品，今日还是名牌，明天就可能名落孙山。过去，主妇不出门，就可以把要买的东西价格算得清清楚楚；可今天，许多商品随行就市，价格不断变化，有升有降；产品花样翻新，夹克衫、T恤衫、派克衫，跟都跟不上趟儿……眼花缭乱的市场！
    在计划经济下生活惯了的消费者，一下子走进带有商品经济色彩的市场，着实有些头晕目眩。可是，既然进入市场，你就得适应市场。
    消费也要动脑筋
    过去，我们走进商店，看好了就买，用不着讨价还价，因为同一个商品，大小商店一个价。如今则不同，一条威狮牌罗卜裤，在这个摊儿21元；那个摊就是23元，再换个地方可能是25元。人们抱怨：个体户的东西没实价儿还可以理解，国营商店的商品怎么也高低不一呢？这种心理却是基于过去对国营商店的认识。其实，如今，流通渠道多了，有些产品的价格又是放开了的，所以，就是同一种商品，在国营商店也可能出现不同价格。再说，如今的国营商店，有的是租赁的，有的是承包的，也很难用过去的眼光认识它了。
    既然很多商品已经不像过去有一个统一价格，而且有其合理性，那么，消费者就得多动脑筋了。假如你高价买了低质商品，那么，很重要的是自己要总结当顾客的经验，而不应该把抱怨一味地抛向社会。
    今年3月15日，是“世界消费者日”。中国消费者协会的工作人员走上街头宣传消费知识并出售《如何鉴别伪劣商品》一书。一位群众对此很反感：不用宣传，你们别让厂家造伪劣商品就是了。过去人们不懂消费，不是一样生活吗？应该提醒，那时是纯粹的计划经济。在商品经济发达的地方，消费者为保护自身利益必须具备必要的商品知识。
    如何根据自己的收入进行消费，是一种学问。据经济学家的调查，低收入的家庭，消费大部分用于吃；中等收入家庭，吃的比重下降，用的比重加强；而在高收入家庭，用的比重下降，娱乐的比重加大。据统计，我国城镇居民家庭的收入总体上是低收入。可是，即使是收入平平的人家，也纷纷购买高档耐用消费品，既造成了自己家庭“财政”的紧张，也造成了市场某些商品的紧张。
    健全消费心理
    为什么低收入却可以买高档消费品？那是因为，我们的城镇居民享受了大量的住房、医疗、交通、水电、若干食品的补贴。使得人们在这方面的支出相对减少。在发展商品经济的今天，这些方面的改革仍是十分艰巨而敏感的问题。
    一位要出嫁的姑娘，当看到郎婿来迎她的竟是一部面包车时，大为恼怒，说什么也不肯上车，上前一问，答曰：别人出嫁都乘轿车，我就比别人低一等吗？已经债台高筑的新郎官不得不出高价现雇一辆出租轿车。
    消费是分多层次的。最低层的消费首先是为了生存，但越是高消费，越注重享受与心理满足。固然，消费有时代特征。比如，骑自行车接新娘的时代过去了，也许现在是新娘坐轿车的时代。可是，对每一个具体消费者来说，都有自己不同的经济条件，在追求某一种消费水平时，就必须考虑：你的经济前提使你的这种追求能否得到真正的享受和心理满足。为了给别人比，结一次婚，发一次昏，有何享受与满足呢？再说，看别人穿什么衣服自己就买什么穿的人，永远只能是个俗气的人。消费上也要讲个性。不应比谁钱花得多，而应比谁钱花得妙。“高消费者”未必全是“高水平的消费者”。
    消费攀比，是人们对自己的经济收入不敢正视或有意掩饰的虚荣心理。
