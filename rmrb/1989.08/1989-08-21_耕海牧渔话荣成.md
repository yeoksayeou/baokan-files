Rongcheng City (county-level), located at the easternmost tip of the Shandong Peninsula, boasts a coastline of over a thousand miles. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, Rongcheng City followed the guiding principle of developing distant-sea, near-sea, and coastal fishing fleets simultaneously. It implemented a management system of unified operation, graded contracting, and profit-sharing based on different proportions for planned and non-planned production. This approach reasonably balanced the relationship between accumulation and distribution, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the fishermen and creating conditions for the steady development of the fishing industry.

Now, the city has 15 enterprises with over a thousand workers each, 14 enterprises with revenues exceeding ten million yuan, and 6 enterprises with aquatic product yields exceeding ten thousand tons. The total catch has been increasing rapidly, reaching 240,000 tons last year, with a total industrial and agricultural output value of over 2.52 billion yuan. The annual per capita income in rural areas is 902 yuan.

Rongcheng's coastline is winding and full of bays, with fertile water quality, making it an ideal place for marine aquaculture. Thus, the people of Rongcheng began shallow-sea farming, turning the vast ocean into a marine farm. While stabilizing the area for kelp cultivation, they actively developed the cultivation of various species such as fish, shrimp, shellfish, and algae. The total area for kelp cultivation in the city has reached over 40,000 acres, accounting for half of the national total. The later-developed bay-cultured shrimp has expanded its area to 25,000 acres, with a total yield approaching the natural catch of shrimp. The area for scallop cultivation has reached 13,000 acres. They also conducted comprehensive planning for the tidal flat area and aquaculture species, rationally laying out the aquaculture industry to show a trend of three-dimensional development on the water surface, tidal flats, and seabed. Currently, the city has 100,000 workers engaged in aquaculture, with a total aquaculture area of 150,000 acres and a total yield of 136,000 tons, generating a total income of 240 million yuan. Along the coastal towns of Rongcheng, cold storage facilities and factories are ubiquitous, most of which are new aquatic product processing projects established in recent years. Currently, the city has over 150 cold storage facilities, more than 200 comprehensive processing plants, 16 canning factories, and more than 10 export processing bases, with an annual export value of over 41 million yuan. Today, aquatic product processing has become the third largest industry in Rongcheng, following fishing and aquaculture. In 1988, the total aquatic product output of Rongcheng reached 320,000 tons, with a total income of 1.1 billion yuan, making it the top county in China's fishing industry.

    耕海牧渔话荣成
    张作生　任松高
    地处山东半岛最东端的荣成市（县级），拥有千里海岸线。党的十一届三中全会以后荣成市按照远洋、近海、沿岸三支捕捞队伍并驾齐驱的指导思想，推行了统一经营、分级承包、计划内外纯收益按不同比例分成的经营承包责任制，合理处理积累与分配的关系，调动了渔民的积极性，为捕捞业的稳步发展创造了条件。现在，全市已拥有千名以上劳力的企业15个，收入超千万元的企业14个，水产品产量超万吨的企业6个，水产品捕捞量直线上升，去年捕捞总量达24万吨，工农业总产值达25.2亿多元，农村年人均收入902元。
    荣成市的海岸线蜿蜒曲折，岬湾相连，水质肥沃，是良好的海水养殖所。于是，荣成人民又开始了浅海耕作，将浩瀚的海洋变成了海上农牧场。他们在稳定海带养殖面积的同时，又积极发展鱼、虾、贝、藻多品种养殖，使全市海带面积达4万多亩，总产量占全国的一半；后来居上的港养对虾，由潮间带向潮上带延伸，总面积扩大到2.5万亩，总产接近天然对虾捕捞量；扇贝养殖面积达1.3万亩。他们还对滩涂面积和养殖品种进行了综合规划，合理布局，使养殖业呈现出水面、滩涂、海底立体发展的趋势。目前，全市从事养殖业的劳力达10万人，海水养殖总面积达15万亩，总产量达13.6万吨，总收入2.4亿元。在荣成沿海城镇，冷库、工厂林立，这些大都是近年来新上的水产品加工项目。目前全市共有冷库150多座、综合加工厂200多处、罐头厂16处，外贸出口加工基地10余处，年出口额4100多万元。如今，水产品加工已成为荣成市继捕捞、养殖之后的第三大产业。1988年，荣成市的水产品总量已达32万吨，收入达11亿元，成为全国渔业县份的“头名状元”。
