    The diligence and wisdom of the Sichuan people have enhanced their reputation. Over the past decade, Sichuan's foreign economic aid and labor cooperation have achieved pioneering developments. Currently, Sichuan has undertaken engineering construction projects in 35 countries around the world. It has provided over 11,000 medical, wool spinning, building materials, planting, and traditional craft technicians and laborers. In May 1983, Sichuan won the bid to construct two roads, Habo and Aba, in Somalia, both of which were completed three to six months ahead of schedule with excellent quality. The President of Somalia expressed his gratitude. The "Moi International Sports Center" built in Kenya is grand in scale and has been praised by President Moi and the International Olympic Committee President Samaranch.

    By June of this year, Sichuan's foreign economic aid and labor cooperation projects have signed over 150 contracts, with a total completed value of 176 million US dollars.

    川人勤劳智慧扬美名
    四川对外经援和劳务合作近10年取得开拓性发展。目前，在世界35个国家承包了工程建设项目；已提供医疗、毛纺、建材、种植和传统工艺等各类技术人员和劳务人员1.1万人次。1983年5月，由四川夺标承包的索马里哈博、阿巴两条公路，以良好的质量分别提前3至6个月竣工。索马里总统表示感谢。援建的肯尼亚“莫伊国际体育中心”规模宏大，受到莫伊总统和国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇的赞扬。
    到今年6月止，四川对外经援、劳务合作签约项目达150多个，已完成金额1.76亿美元。
