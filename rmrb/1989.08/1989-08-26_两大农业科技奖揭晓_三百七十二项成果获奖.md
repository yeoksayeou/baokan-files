The Ministry of Agriculture's Science and Technology Commission held its second session of the second full meeting today, announcing the winners of 184 science and technology progress awards, including 11 first prizes and 47 second prizes. Additionally, 188 "Harvest Awards" were also announced.

These award-winning projects are notable for their significant economic or social benefits. For example, the new high-yielding, high-quality wheat variety "Shaanxi 7859," submitted by the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, is known for its disease resistance, high yield, good quality, drought tolerance, and flood resistance. Since its promotion in 1987, the planting area has rapidly expanded, reaching over 14 million mu in 1988. The average yield per mu was 385.5 kilograms, which is 13.2% higher than the current main varieties used in production.

A large number of advanced agricultural science and technologies have produced tremendous social and economic benefits. For instance, Beijing Municipality has summarized and promoted a comprehensive set of dairy cow breeding and reproduction technologies. Over the past decade, the number of dairy cows in Beijing has increased by 2.3 times, and milk production has increased by 2.4 times, effectively alleviating the long-standing issue of milk shortages. Currently, each resident of Beijing consumes an average of 30 kilograms of fresh milk per year, leading the nation's major cities in this regard.

    两大农业科技奖揭晓
    三百七十二项成果获奖
    本报北京8月26日讯　记者王友恭报道：在今天闭幕的农业部科学技术委员会第二届第二次全体会上，评选出184项科技进步奖，其中一等奖11项，二等奖47项；还评出188项“丰收奖”。
    这些获奖项目大都具有经济效益大或社会效益好的特点。如由陕西省农科院申报的大面积丰产优质小麦新品种“陕农7859”，具有抗病、丰产、品质好、耐旱、耐涝等特点，自1987年推广以来播种面积迅速扩大，1988年播种面积已达1400多万亩。大面积平均亩产达到385.5公斤，比当前生产上应用的主栽品种单产还高13.2％。
    一大批先进农业科学技术产生了巨大的社会经济效益。如北京市总结推广的一整套奶牛饲养繁殖技术，使该市10年来奶牛头数增加2.3倍，牛奶量增长2.4倍，从而缓解了长期以来存在的订奶难的矛盾。目前北京市民每人每年鲜牛奶占有量达到30公斤，在全国各大城市中居领先地位。
