	Kishchak announced
	Willing to resign as Polish Prime Minister
	Newly appointed Polish Prime Minister Kishchak announced on the 14th that he is willing to resign from the position of Prime Minister given the current difficulties in forming a cabinet, and suggested that Polish President nominate the chairman of the United Peasants Party, Marianowski, as the new Prime Minister.

	Kishchak, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party's Central Committee Political Bureau, was appointed by the Polish Parliament as the Prime Minister on the 2nd of August. In his inaugural speech to the Parliament, he stated that he would meet with various parties, groups, and opposition leaders to discuss the formation of the cabinet, aiming to form a grand coalition government. He also announced that he would submit the list of new cabinet members to the Parliament in two weeks.

	On the evening of the 7th of August, Lech Wałęsa, the chairman of Solidarity, issued a statement expressing opposition to Kishchak becoming the Prime Minister, and suggested that "Solidarity, the United Peasants Party, and the Democratic Party form a coalition government." The United Peasants Party and the Democratic Party had long been in coalition with the United Workers' Party. Wałęsa's statement indicated that Solidarity was attempting to exclude the United Workers' Party from the government.

	Kishchak's statement pointed out that for Poland, establishing a grand coalition government would be "the best possible outcome." The statement believed that nominating Marianowski as the Prime Minister would be beneficial for the formation of a grand coalition government.

    基什查克声明
    愿辞去波总理职务
    新华社华沙8月14日电（记者汤德乔）波兰新任总理基什查克14日发表声明，表示在目前组阁遇到困难的情况下愿意辞去总理职务，并建议波兰总统提名统一农民党主席马里诺夫斯基为新总理人选。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员基什查克是8月2日被波兰议会任命为政府总理的。他在议会上发表就职演说时说，他将与各党派、团体和反对派负责人会晤，商谈组阁事宜，争取组成大联合政府，并宣布二周后向议会提出新政府成员名单。
    8月7日晚，团结工会主席瓦文萨发表声明，表示反对基什查克出任政府总理，建议“由团结工会、统一农民党和民主党联合组阁”。统一农民党和民主党曾与统一工人党长期联合执政，瓦文萨的声明表明团结工会试图把统一工人党排斥于政府之外。
    基什查克的声明指出，对波兰来说，建立一个大联合政府是“最好不过的”。声明认为，建议由马里诺夫斯基任总理，有利于组成大联合政府。
