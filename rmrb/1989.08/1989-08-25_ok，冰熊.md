    “OK, Ice Bear!”
    Our newspaper reports: “OK, Ice Bear!” When the Ministry of Commerce issued the first permit for the production of a series of refrigerators to the Shangqiu Low-Temperature Equipment Factory, people expressed their admiration to them.

    In the summer of 1986, Senior Economist Chen Zuoyu was tasked with establishing the factory. Equipment was imported from the “cooling kingdom” of Italy. Among the eight designated factories nationwide, they completed production in just three months and made a profit of 400,000 yuan in the same year. Their “Ice Bear” refrigerators quickly sold to over 200 cities across the country and to the United States, the Soviet Union, Australia, the Philippines, and other countries. The boss of the Italian company Ebani told Chen Zuoyu, “We have walked this path for 30 years, and we hope you can complete it in 15 years.” Chen Zuoyu said, “No, 7 years! Our goal is to achieve the highest per capita output, per capita contribution, and product quality in the industry nationwide.” Last year, the factory's per capita tax revenue was 20,000 yuan, and by the first half of this year, it had reached 21,000 yuan. By the end of the year, the factory is expected to have a total output value of 200 million yuan and a per capita tax revenue of 40,000 yuan.

    “OK，冰熊”
    本报讯　“OK，冰熊！”当商业部将生产系列冰柜的第一张许可证颁发给商丘低温设备厂的时候，人们纷纷向他们表示赞叹。
    1986年夏，高级经济师陈作雨奉命筹建该厂，设备从“制冷王国”意大利引进，全国8个定点厂中，他们仅用三个月时间，便顺利投产，当年盈利40万元。他们生产的“冰熊”冰柜很快销往国内200多个城市及美、苏、澳大利亚、菲律宾等国。意大利依版纳公司老板对陈作雨讲，我们走了30年的路，希望你们15年走完。陈作雨说，不，7年！我们的目标是在全国同行业中创人均产值、人均贡献、产品质量第一。该厂去年人均创税利2万元，今年上半年已达2.1万元。到年底，全厂预计产值2亿元，人均创税利4万元。　（秦友堂　王超群）
