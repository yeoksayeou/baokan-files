In Hebei Province’s Han Dan County, 458 party branches have established party member activity rooms, providing a fixed activity space for over 11,000 party members in the county.

In these fixed activity spaces, a variety of activities such as study sessions, party classes, life meetings, and cultural entertainment attract a large number of party members. Some branches hold activities to celebrate party members' political birthdays in the activity rooms. Most branches use this platform to conduct education on party fundamentals and policy orientations for party members. Currently, the image of party members in Han Dan County has undergone a gratifying change. The percentage of party members who pay their dues on time has increased from 87% at the beginning of the year to 96%. Over 97% of party members have achieved their work goals for the first half of the year. Additionally, 750 party members have recently been recognized as outstanding party members by the city and county.

    邯郸县普遍建立党员活动室
    河北省邯郸县有四百五十八个党支部建立了党员活动室，使全县一万一千多名共产党员有了固定的活动之家。
    在固定的活动场所里，丰富多彩的学习、党课、生活会和文化娱乐等项活动吸引着广大党员。有的支部在活动室内开展为党员过政治生日的活动。多数支部则用这块阵地，对党员开展党的基础知识和形势政策教育。目前，邯郸县党员面貌发生了可喜变化，按时交纳党费的党员由年初的百分之八十七提高到百分之九十六；百分之九十七以上的党员如期实现了上半年的工作目标；有七百五十名党员在最近被市、县评为优秀党员。　　　　　　吴连杰
