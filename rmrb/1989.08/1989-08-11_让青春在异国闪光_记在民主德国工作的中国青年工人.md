Let Youth Shine in a Foreign Land

A Record of Chinese Youth Workers in the German Democratic Republic

By Xǔ Hóngzhì, Correspondent of the People's Daily

Dechau, Bausen, and Zitao are three small cities in the German Democratic Republic. Two years ago, according to the labor cooperation agreement signed by the two countries, the Chinese Civil Engineering Corporation sent over 900 young workers to work and receive training in three factories in these three cities. The contract period is 2-4 years. Two years have passed, and these young workers feel that they have gained a lot. Their work, study achievements, and the spirit they show have been praised by the cadres and workers of the GDR.

“The Model of Foreign Workers”

The growth and progress of the youth are inseparable from the Party organization's efforts in political and ideological work. Among the 450 Chinese youth workers in the Bausen Bus Factory, there are more than 60 Communist Party members, and more than half are members of the Communist Youth League. Party members and league members set an example in all aspects. The Party organization conducts education on patriotism and discipline for the specific ideological problems existing among the youth, making everyone understand the great significance of implementing the labor cooperation agreement. The youth workers' ideological understanding continues to improve, they voluntarily abide by the disciplines, strictly require themselves, overcome the difficulties encountered in language, life, and work in a foreign country, and strive to achieve results in their work. In the three factories in Dechau, Bausen, and Zitao, every year, a large number of Chinese youth workers are commended and rewarded, and are awarded various honorary titles. The leaders of these three factories all believe that Chinese youth are smart and work hard, and have become an important force in the factory.

The Dechau Railway Refrigerated Vehicle Manufacturing Plant has a "Chinese Group" in the double-layer workshop, which is mainly composed of Chinese youth and is responsible for operating a large automated gantry welding machine, with 23-year-old Chinese youth Wan Yanhong as the group leader. The GDR workers in the group also respect his leadership. The factory director, Mei Biyousite, mentioned the "Chinese Group" to the reporter and praised them for quickly mastering the technology.

The Zitao Railway Vehicle Spring Factory is a small factory with only 300 people, with relatively backward equipment, high labor intensity, and the factory often fails to complete the plan, facing the danger of closure.

80 Chinese youth workers were assigned to work in this factory. The Party organization required them to abide by the factory rules and regulations and pass the labor test. The largest spring weighs 75 kilograms, and the youth workers carry it up and down without complaining. They completed the quota in the first week after they started working, and then completed the plan in excess every month, gradually reversing the backward situation of the factory. The old director was deeply moved and said: "Now every time I go to Berlin for a meeting, I can hold my head high." He loved these young men from the bottom of his heart and praised them to everyone he met. The mayor of Zitao also praised, "The 80 Chinese workers in Zitao are the model of the 20,000 foreign workers in the entire Dresden district."

Seeing the Gap

Recently, many young workers will take turns to return home for vacation. When they talked with the reporter, they believed that the biggest gain in the past two years was seeing the gap between themselves and the GDR workers. Under the education of the Party organization and the influence of the surrounding environment, their quality has greatly improved. The equipment in these few factories is not much better than ours, but due to the strict management system, the workers have strong labor discipline, and they work meticulously, so their labor productivity is higher than ours. The Chinese young men are not willing to fall behind. After two years of training, the vast majority of people can abide by the disciplines like the GDR workers, work diligently, and complete the tasks well.

Some leading cadres said that the management of GDR enterprises is done according to the system. No matter who violates the system or whose quality does not meet the requirements, the regulations are strictly enforced.

In the early days of coming to the GDR, some leading cadres pleaded with the GDR side for Chinese youth workers who violated the system, requesting "no precedent." The GDR cadres were very surprised and felt that our cadres were like "firefighters" and "umbrellas." The leading cadres said that if the discipline is violated, it should be dealt with according to the system. You can't be unreasonable and still talk about personal feelings, interfering with the implementation of the system.

A Heart for China

In the work, Chinese youth workers and GDR workers have developed a deep friendship. On holidays, they often visit GDR friends' homes, and sometimes they make dumplings together.

The arrival of Chinese youth workers has also greatly deepened the residents of these three cities' understanding of China. They saw that the Chinese young men were all dressed in fashionable clothes, listening to Chinese-made tape recorders, and wearing Chinese-made electronic watches, and were surprised to say: "It turns out that China can also produce such good products!"

These young people always associate themselves with their motherland. Although they are far away from their motherland, they are very concerned about the affairs of their motherland.

They listen to the Chinese programs broadcast by the Beijing Radio Station to Europe every night. As soon as the People's Daily arrives, everyone rushes to read it. They generally do not agree with the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in the country. They said that the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots have caused losses to our country. The stability and prosperity of the country make us feel at ease abroad.

These simple words reflect the youth's sincere love for their motherland. Although they are far away from their motherland, they love their motherland even more, because they all have a heart for China. With their deep love for their motherland, they let their youth shine brightly on the land of a foreign country.

    让青春在异国闪光
    ——记在民主德国工作的中国青年工人
    本报记者  许宏治
    德绍、包岑、齐陶是德意志民主共和国三个小城。两年前，根据两国政府签订的劳务合作协定，中国土木工程公司派出900多名青年工人，分别在这三个城市的三家工厂工作并接受培训，合同期2—4年。两年过去了，这些青年工人都感到收获很大，他们的工作、学习成绩和表现出的精神风貌受到民德干部、工人的交口赞誉。
    “外籍工人的模范”
    青年们的成长、进步与党组织抓紧政治思想工作分不开。在包岑客车厂工作的450名中国青工，有60多名共产党员，一半以上是共青团员。党团员在各方面作表率。党组织针对青年中存在的具体思想问题，经常进行爱国主义和遵章守纪等方面的教育，使大家认识执行劳务合作协定的重大意义。青工们思想认识不断提高，自觉遵守纪律，严格要求自己，克服在异国语言、生活、工作等方面遇到的困难，努力在工作中做出成绩。在德绍、包岑、齐陶的三个工厂，每年都有大批中国青工受到表彰、奖励，被授予各种荣誉称号。这几个工厂的领导都认为，中国青年聪明，工作努力，已成了厂里的一支重要力量。
    德绍铁路冷藏车辆制造厂的夹层车间有一个以中国青年为主体的“中国组”，负责操纵一台大型自动化龙门点焊机，由23岁的中国青工万年红任组长。组里的民德工人也很服他的领导。厂长梅比乌斯特地向记者提到“中国组”，称赞他们技术掌握得快。
    齐陶铁路车辆弹簧厂是一家仅有300人的小厂，设备比较落后，劳动强度大，工厂经常完不成计划，面临倒闭的危险。
    80名中国青工被分配到这家工厂工作。党组织要求他们遵守厂规厂纪，过好劳动关。最大的弹簧一个就重75公斤，青年们搬上搬下，毫不叫苦。他们投入工作后第一个星期就完成了定额，以后月月超额完成计划，逐渐扭转了工厂落后面貌。老厂长深受感动地说：
  “现在我每次去柏林开会都能挺起胸来了。”他从心底里爱上了这些小伙子，逢人便夸。齐陶市市长也称赞说，“在齐陶的80名中国工人是整个德累斯顿专区2万名外籍工人的模范”。
    看到了自己的差距
    最近，许多青工要轮流回国休假。他们与记者交谈时认为，过去两年最大的收获是看到了自己和民德工人的差距，在党组织的教育和周围环境的影响下，素质大大提高。这几家工厂的设备并不比我们好多少，但由于管理制度严格，工人劳动纪律性强，干活一丝不苟，劳动生产率比我们高。中国小伙子不甘落后，经过两年的锻炼，绝大多数人能和民德工人一样遵守纪律，踏实工作，很好地完成任务。
    一些带队干部说，民德企业管理一切按制度办事，不管谁违反制度，或质量达不到要求，都严格执行规定。
    来民德初期，有的带队干部为违反制度的中国青工向德方求情，要求“下不为例”。民德干部很奇怪，觉得我们的干部像“救火队”、“保护伞”。带队干部说，违反了纪律，就要按制度处理。不能明明不在理，还要讲人情，干扰制度的执行。
    都有一颗中国心
    在工作中，中国青工和民德工人结下了深厚友谊。每逢休假日，他们常到民德朋友家做客，有时还一起包饺子。
    中国青工的到来使这三个城市的居民对中国的了解也大为加深。他们看到中国小伙子个个穿着时髦的服装，听着中国产的收录机，戴着中国产的电子表，十分惊讶地说：原来中国也能生产这么好的产品！
    这些青年人时刻把自己和祖国联系在一起。虽然远在异国，但他们对祖国的事情非常关心。
    他们每天晚上按时收听北京广播电台对欧洲华侨广播的汉语节目。《人民日报》一到，大家争相阅读。对不久前国内发生的动乱和反革命暴乱，青工们普遍不赞成。他们说，动乱和反革命暴乱使我们国家受到损失。国内安定、富强，我们在国外才能感到放心。
    这些朴实的话语，反映了青年们对祖国的一片赤诚之心。他们虽远离祖国，但对祖国爱得更深，因为他们人人都有一颗中国心。他们怀着对祖国的挚爱之心，让自己的青春在异国土地上闪闪发光。
