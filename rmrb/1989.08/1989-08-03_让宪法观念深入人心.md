The suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has achieved decisive victory. Reflecting on the past, there are many issues worthy of our consideration. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Over the past decade, our biggest mistake has been in education, and this education primarily refers to the ideological and political education of the entire population. Looking back at this turmoil that evolved from student protests and unrest into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, we can see that legal education, especially constitutional education, has not achieved the desired results. The Constitution, which holds the highest legal status, has not effectively constrained people to act in accordance with the law. In the Beijing area, so many people took to the streets, using certain provisions of the Constitution, consciously or unconsciously, to do things that violate the Constitution.

The Constitution is the fundamental law of the state. It represents the interests and will of the broad masses of the people led by the working class and affirms and guarantees the socialist system and the system of people's democratic dictatorship. The Constitution legalizes and institutionalizes socialist democracy in the form of fundamental law, stipulating and guaranteeing the extensive basic rights and obligations of citizens. However, due to the highly principled nature of constitutional norms, some people mistakenly believe that the Constitution is merely a program, not a law that must be obeyed. Some people also often simply think that only actions that violate criminal law are subject to legal punishment, unaware that actions that do not violate criminal law but violate the Constitution must also be investigated.

Due to a lack of understanding of the basic spirit and principles of the Constitution, some cadres and the masses, including some highly educated intellectuals, often abandon the basic spirit and principles of the Constitution, interpreting it in an anarchist and petty-bourgeois manner. They selectively pick out individual articles of the Constitution to serve their own purposes, greatly distorting the principles of the Constitution. What are the basic spirit and principles of the Constitution? First, the Constitution stipulates that the socialist system is the fundamental system of our country. It is prohibited for any organization or individual to undermine the socialist system, which is the foundation of our state. However, during this student protest and unrest, many people did not grasp this basic principle that determines the fundamental nature of our Constitution, proposing slogans that oppose the socialist path and endanger the socialist system.

Second, the people's congress system is our fundamental political system. The Constitution stipulates that the National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power. The highest power of a socialist state is indivisible, and our state organs can only operate on the principle of democratic centralism. However, a small number of people who conspired to subvert our social and political system proposed some bourgeois slogans, and many young students and citizens, unable to distinguish right from wrong, echoed them, trampling on the Constitution.

Third, the Constitution not only stipulates the rights of citizens but also their obligations, and especially emphasizes that when citizens exercise their rights, they must not harm the interests of the state, society, collectives, and the lawful freedom and rights of other citizens. But some people understand the relationship between rights and obligations stipulated in the Constitution in a one-sided manner, starting from the emotions and interests of individuals or small groups, or even certain social groups, using the exercise of constitutional rights as a pretext to harm the interests of the state, collectives, and other citizens.

In the counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing, some citizens, due to a lack of understanding of the specific requirements of the Constitution, often regarded various illegal acts as "patriotic actions." Article 12 of our Constitution states: Socialist public property is inviolable, and it is forbidden for any organization or individual to appropriate or damage state and collective property by any means. However, under the instigation of the rioters, some people disregarded the constitutional norms, participating in the burning and smashing of public buses and military vehicles. It is particularly worth noting that the Constitution clearly stipulates that citizens have the obligation to cherish public property. During the counter-revolutionary rebellion, a considerable number of people, instead of stopping the rioters from beating, smashing, burning, and looting public property, actually fanned the flames, which is another form of violating the Constitution.

For example, Article 37 of the Constitution states: The personal freedom of citizens is inviolable, and it is forbidden to conduct illegal searches of citizens' bodies. Article 38 states: The personal dignity of citizens is inviolable, and it is forbidden to insult, defame, or frame citizens by any means. However, during the unrest, some people arbitrarily conducted illegal checks of pedestrians' documents at intersections, attacked and insulted national leaders, seriously infringing upon others' personal dignity. Again, Article 54 of the Constitution states that citizens have the obligation to safeguard the security, honor, and interests of the motherland and must not engage in any behavior that endangers the security, honor, and interests of the motherland. However, during the unrest in Beijing, some people supported students in occupying Tiananmen Square for an extended period, preventing major state affairs activities such as the Sino-Soviet high-level talks from proceeding as planned, and some activities had to be canceled, seriously damaging the country's image and honor. These are all issues worthy of our deep reflection.

    让宪法观念深入人心
    辽宁大连市人民检察院　张本金
    平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱已取得决定性胜利。认真思考过去，有许多值得我们反思的问题。邓小平同志指出：十年来我们最大的失误是教育，而且这种教育主要是指对全体人民的思想政治教育。纵观这次由学潮、动乱而发展成的反革命暴乱，我们可以看出，法制教育、特别是宪法教育未能取得应有的效果，具有最高法律地位的宪法，并没有能够有效地约束人们依法办事。北京地区那么多人上街游行，利用宪法的某些具体规定，自觉或不自觉地干着违反宪法的事。
    宪法，是国家的根本大法，它集中代表了工人阶级领导的广大人民的利益和意志，确认和保障社会主义的社会制度和人民民主专政的国家制度。宪法以根本大法的形式将社会主义民主法律化和制度化，规定并保障公民广泛的基本权利和义务。但是，由于宪法规范有极强的原则性，一些人错误地认为，宪法只是一种纲领，而不是必须服从的法律。一些人也常常简单地认为只有触犯刑律才受法律制裁，而不知道那些虽不触犯刑律，但却违反宪法的行为，也必须予以追究。
    由于对宪法的基本精神和原则不真正理解，有些干部和群众，包括部分有很高文化素质的知识分子，常常放弃宪法的基本精神和原则，对宪法作出无政府主义和小资产阶级的理解。他们根据个人或小集团的利益，孤立地摘取宪法的个别条文，为自己的目的服务，极大地歪曲了宪法的原则。宪法的基本精神和原则是什么呢？第一，宪法规定社会主义制度是我国的根本制度。禁止任何组织或者个人破坏社会主义制度，这是我们的立国之本。但在这次学潮和动乱中，许多人并没有去把握这个决定我国宪法根本性质的基本原则，提出了一些反对社会主义道路、危害社会主义制度的口号。
    第二，人民代表大会制度是我国基本政治制度。宪法规定全国人民代表大会是国家最高权力机关。社会主义国家的最高权力是不可分割的，我国的国家机构只能实行民主集中制的原则。但是，极少数阴谋颠覆我国社会政治制度的人提出一些资产阶级口号，许多青年学生、市民竟然不辨是非，随声附和，践踏了宪法。
    第三，宪法不仅规定了公民的权利，而且规定了公民的义务，并特别提出公民在行使权利的时候不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。但有一些人片面理解宪法规定的权利与义务的关系，从个人或小集团甚至是某个社会群体的情绪、利益出发，以行使宪法规定的正当的个人权利为借口，损害国家、集体和其他公民的利益。
    在北京发生的这次反党反社会主义的动乱中，部分市民由于不了解宪法的具体要求，常常把各种各样的违宪行为视为“爱国行动”。我国宪法第十二条规定：社会主义的公共财产神圣不可侵犯，禁止任何组织或者个人用任何手段侵占或者破坏国家的和集体的财产。但是，在暴徒的煽动下，有人置宪法规范于不顾，参与烧、砸公共汽车和军车。特别要指出，宪法在规定公民义务时，明确提出我国公民有爱护公共财产的义务。在反革命暴乱期间，有相当的人在这种场合看到反革命暴徒打、砸、烧、抢公共财物，非但不制止，反而助长其气焰就是另一种形式的违反宪法。
    又如：宪法第三十七条规定：公民的人身自由不受侵犯，禁止非法搜查公民身体。第三十八条规定：公民的人格尊严不受侵犯，禁止用任何方法对公民进行侮辱、诽谤和诬告陷害。但是，动乱期间有些人随意在路口非法检查行人证件，攻击谩骂国家领导人，严重侵犯了他人的人格尊严。再如：宪法第五十四条规定，公民有维护祖国的安全、荣誉和利益的义务，不得有危害祖国安全、荣誉和利益的行为。但是，北京发生动乱期间，一些人支持学生长期占据天安门广场，使中苏高级会谈等一些重大国事活动不能按计划进行，一些活动不得不取消，严重损害了国家的形象和荣誉，这都是值得我们深刻反思的。
