Edition: 1

The article "The Communist Party Must Accept Supervision" is excerpted from the recently published "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1938-1965)." Strengthening party building, adhering to and improving party leadership, and expanding party and state democratic life are consistent thoughts of Comrade Xiaoping. The important proposition of "the party must accept supervision" embodies these thoughts and has significant guiding importance for the current and future party building.

The party must be supervised, and party members must be supervised. The Eighth National Congress emphasized this issue. Chairman Mao recently emphasized the need for a set of regulations, specifically for supervision. Chairman Mao said, "We need to stage a counter-performance, as a counter-performance is better than acting alone." Our party is the ruling party with high prestige. A large number of our cadres are in leadership positions. In China, who has the qualifications to make major mistakes? It is the Communist Party of China. If mistakes are made, the impact will be the greatest. Therefore, our party should be particularly vigilant. The constitution stipulates the leadership of the party. For the party to lead well, it must continuously overcome subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and it must be supervised and expand party and state democratic life. If we do not accept supervision and do not pay attention to expanding party and state democratic life, we will definitely become detached from the masses and make major mistakes. Because if we close the door and work alone, relying on seniority and thinking that is enough, not humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and non-party members, it is easy to become isolated, and problems will be considered one-sided. This will inevitably lead to mistakes. Therefore, after the victory of the revolution, Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized this issue, which shows deep and far-sighted thinking.

Supervision comes from three aspects. First, party supervision. For Communist Party members, party supervision is the most direct. Party life should be stricter, and so should the life of the Communist Youth League, meaning that the party's supervision of party members should be stricter, and the league's supervision of its members should be stricter. Second, supervision by the masses. We should expand the masses' supervision of the party and party members. Third, supervision by democratic parties and non-party democrats. We should expand their supervision of the Communist Party and Communist Party members. With supervision from these aspects, we will be more cautious, our information will be more timely, our minds will not become rigid, and we will have fewer one-sided views. Communist Party members being overly cautious is not good, and being too bold is also not good. Fear of the party, fear of the masses, and fear of democratic parties is better. Caution is always good.

In terms of the masses, we should expand democracy in all aspects. The People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference should be well-organized. Holding good People's Congresses and Political Consultative Conferences at all levels is very beneficial. Recently, the National Political Consultative Conference was held very well, with frank discussions and many good suggestions. In terms of factory and enterprise management, democracy should be expanded. The recent central directive on handling strike issues emphasized this point. We should establish workers' congresses and strengthen their role, which means we should expand the masses' supervision in factories and enterprises. In this regard, the Eighth Congress resolution only mentioned one aspect, emphasizing the factory director's responsibility system under the party committee's leadership. The directive on handling strike issues added another point: the masses' supervision system under the party committee's leadership. There is both a top-down factory director's responsibility system under the party committee's leadership and a bottom-up masses' supervision system under the party committee's leadership. Factory and enterprise leaders will be more cautious with mass supervision than without it. Implementing mass supervision can mobilize the masses' enthusiasm and propose many good suggestions. It is said that a considerable number of factory and enterprise administrative leaders do not understand this. They always feel that not being supervised is more comfortable, and that arbitrary rule is more convenient. Because many leaders do not understand, it seems that supervision is even more important, and not implementing mass supervision is even more dangerous. Even in rural areas, when establishing cooperatives, democracy should be expanded and cooperatives should be run democratically. Rural cadres' commandism is related to the lack of democratic style in higher-level leadership. The plan is so rigid, how can it not be enforced? In Shanxi, farmers' opinion of us is: "You interfere too much." When we went to Jinan, the local leadership stipulated that cotton tops should be pinched on August 5, and those not meeting the size requirement were not allowed to pinch tops. Those who followed the instructions harvested 40 jin per mu, while those who did not followed the instructions harvested 50 jin per mu. What kind of advanced experience is this? This is also an abuse of the party's prestige. Farmers have no choice but to follow the party's call and do it. This situation can be forgiven occasionally, but if it continues, it will not work. In schools, democracy should also be expanded. Teachers' and students' unions should play a role, and the opinions of teachers and students should be fully expressed. School leaders should be good at absorbing the opinions of teachers and students. Promoting democracy will not hinder unified leadership. Our army is the most disciplined, right? In the past, we fought wars relying on the army's democratic life. Did this hinder our unified command? Did this hinder leadership and management? Only by strengthening unity from top to bottom can things be done better. In fact, when the masses participate in things, even if they encounter difficulties and make mistakes, they can endure it and rarely complain; on the contrary, implementing commandism, even if things are done right, the masses are not satisfied. Therefore, expanding democratic life in all aspects and expanding mass supervision is very important.

The "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" of various parties are what Chairman Mao said, and I do not intend to elaborate. What I want to talk about is that many people in our party do not understand and do not understand its benefits. This sixteen-character policy has a profound impact on our country, is of great benefit to our party, and is of great benefit to the development of Marxism-Leninism. If we do not pay attention and do not implement "let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," our thinking will become rigid, and Marxism will decline. Only by implementing "let a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," expressing various opinions, and engaging in debates can we truly develop Marxism and develop dialectical materialism. This point, Stalin made mistakes, and it was too rigid and too simple. In the Soviet Union, Marxism declined for a period. "Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is also the same, supervision is better than no supervision, and it is better for a part of the people to come up with ideas than for everyone to come up with ideas. The Communist Party always looks at problems from one angle, and democratic parties can look at problems from another angle and come up with ideas. In this way, more problems are reflected, and problems are handled more comprehensively. It is more beneficial to make decisions and formulate policies, and even if problems occur, they are easier to correct. Therefore, this sixteen-character policy should be understood.

Now, in some places, aren't they talking about making trouble? Aren't some people talking about big democracy? Some young people always think that big democracy can solve problems. We do not advocate big democracy. Big democracy can be avoided, so we need small democracy. If there is no small democracy, then big democracy will definitely come. The masses have to vent their anger, and our approach is to give the masses a place to vent, a place to speak, and a place to appeal. The masses' opinions are generally a few types: some are reasonable, and we should accept and act on them; some are basically reasonable, and we should act on the reasonable parts and explain the parts that cannot be done; some are unreasonable, and we should do work and persuade. In short, we should allow the masses to express their opinions regularly at the People's Congress, Political Consultative Conference, workers' congress, students' congress, or in various settings, so that they can raise opinions and vent their anger when they have them. With small democracy, there will be no big democracy. After the masses vent their anger and problems are solved as much as possible, how can there be big democracy? How can there be strikes and walkouts? We do not advocate big democracy, and big democracy is not good. Hungary implemented big democracy and took several years to recover, and the people suffered. Poland implemented big democracy and also needed a considerable period to recover. Therefore, big democracy should not be hoped for, and there is nothing to learn from it. However, serious bureaucrats will always be there, so sometimes making trouble is inevitable. This is not a big problem. When encountering such situations, we should stay calm, face the masses, rely on the masses, and patiently do work, and the problem can be solved.

If we do as mentioned above, our party can lead and will not be overthrown, because we are with the masses, not treating the masses and non-party members with sectarian attitudes, not treating the masses with bureaucratic attitudes, and not handling problems with subjective attitudes. If our party could lead well in the past, it can still lead well in the future. Whether the Communist Party has the qualifications to lead depends on the party itself. Whether others recognize it or not is another matter. If you are qualified, others' recognition does not matter; if you are not qualified, others' recognition does not matter either. Ultimately, it depends on ourselves. Now, can the Communist Party lead schools? Can it lead science? Now, our skills are not great! As Chairman Mao said, it is both leading and not leading. Political leadership is stipulated in the constitution, and it seems to be fine, but not all Communist Party members are capable. If the Communist Party leads with sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism, even if it says it can lead, it will not be able to lead. Leading with correct methods and correct thinking will lead to success and unity. As for which department's science, of course, we do not understand. If we do not understand, we should unite everyone to do it. In short, whether the Communist Party's leadership is qualified depends on the party's thoughts and style.

As long as the party and party members do not become detached from the masses, as long as the party and party members accept supervision, as long as the party and party members humbly learn, and as long as the party and party members continuously work and do ideological and political work, our party will definitely be able to lead the country's construction smoothly, as it did in leading the revolution to victory. In a relatively short period, we will learn to build and manage the economy, and turn our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country.

*This is part of the report given by Comrade Xiaoping at the Xi'an cadre meeting. Notes:

[1] The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from September 15 to 27, 1956. This congress analyzed the situation after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production and proposed the task of fully developing socialist construction. At the congress, Mao Zedong delivered the opening speech, Liu Shaoqi gave a political report, Zhou Enlai gave a report on "Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy," and Deng Xiaoping gave a report on "Amending the Party Constitution"; Zhu De, Chen Yun, Dong Biwu, and others made important speeches. The congress passed the "Resolution on the Political Report," the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China," and the "Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy (1958-1962)," and elected a new Central Committee. The Eighth Congress formulated the correct line, pointing the way for the development of the socialist cause and party building.

[3] See Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II," People's Publishing House, 1986 edition, page 783).

[4] "Big democracy" and "small democracy" are sarcastic terms. Mao Zedong, in his speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in November 1956, quoted and explained them. He criticized the view of some people who advocated big democracy, saying that small democracy was not enough and that they wanted to implement Western-style bourgeois democracy in China. At the same time, the speech used big democracy to represent large-scale mass struggles or making trouble. The "big democracy" mentioned here refers to large-scale turmoil and making trouble. The "small democracy" mentioned below refers to the serious implementation of the democratic system stipulated in our country's constitution, so that the people's right to freely express their opinions and other democratic rights are respected and guaranteed.

    共产党要接受监督
    （一九五七年四月八日）
    邓小平
    编者按：《共产党要接受监督》一文选自新近出版的《邓小平文选》（1938年至1965年）。加强党的建设，坚持和改善党的领导，扩大党和国家的民主生活，是小平同志的一贯思想。“党要接受监督”这一重要论述体现了小平同志的上述思想，对当前和今后的党的建设都有着十分重要的指导意义。
    党要受监督，党员要受监督，八大〔1〕强调了这个问题。毛主席最近特别强调要有一套章程，就是为了监督。毛主席说，要唱对台戏，唱对台戏比单干好。我们党是执政的党，威信很高。我们大量的干部居于领导地位。在中国来说，谁有资格犯大错误？就是中国共产党。犯了错误影响也最大。因此，我们党应该特别警惕。宪法上规定了党的领导，党要领导得好，就要不断地克服主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，就要受监督，就要扩大党和国家的民主生活。如果我们不受监督，不注意扩大党和国家的民主生活，就一定要脱离群众，犯大错误。因为我们如果关起门来办事，凭老资格，自以为这样就够了，对群众、对党外人士的意见不虚心去听，就很容易使自己闭塞起来，考虑问题产生片面性，这样非犯错误不可。所以毛主席在革命胜利之后再三强调这个问题，这是看得很深很远的。
    所谓监督来自三个方面。第一，是党的监督。对于共产党员来说，党的监督是最直接的。要求党的生活严一些，团的生活也严一些，也就是说，党对党员的监督要严格一些，团对团员的监督要严格一些。第二，是群众的监督。要扩大群众对党的监督，对党员的监督。第三，是民主党派和无党派民主人士的监督。要扩大他们对共产党的监督，对共产党员的监督。有了这几方面的监督，我们就会谨慎一些，我们的消息就会灵通一些，我们的脑子就不会僵死起来，看问题就会少一些片面性。共产党员谨小慎微不好，胆子太大了也不好。一怕党，二怕群众，三怕民主党派，总是好一些。谨慎总是好一些。
    在群众方面，要扩大各方面的民主。人民代表大会、政协会要开好。开好各级人民代表大会、政协会，很有益处。最近全国政协会开得很好，畅所欲言，有好多好意见。厂矿企业的管理方面，要扩大民主。最近中央关于处理罢工罢课问题的指示里强调了这个问题。要搞职工代表大会，加强它的作用，这就是要求我们在厂矿企业里扩大群众的监督。在这方面，八大决议中只讲了一面，强调了党委领导下的厂长负责制，这次处理罢工罢课问题的指示里还加了一条，即党委领导下的群众监督制。既有自上而下的党委领导下的厂长负责制，又有自下而上的党委领导下的群众监督制。厂矿企业的领导同志，有群众监督比之没有群众监督要好一些，会谨慎一些。实行群众监督可以把群众的积极性调动起来，会提出很多好的意见。听说相当一部分厂矿企业的行政领导者对这一点想不通。他们总觉得：不受监督，自己下命令舒服，独断专行比较方便。正因为相当多的领导同志思想不通，看起来监督就更加重要了，不搞群众监督就更危险了。就是农村办合作社，也要扩大民主，实行民主办社。农村干部的命令主义是同上级领导的缺乏民主作风分不开的。计划搞得那样死，怎能不强迫命令呢？在山西，农民对我们的意见是：“你们管得太多了”。我们到晋南，当地领导机关规定八月初五棉花打顶尖，不够尺寸不准打顶尖，干部拿上尺子到地里量着打顶尖，照办了的每亩收棉四十斤，没照办的每亩收棉五十斤。这叫什么先进经验？这也是滥用党的威信。农民对我们无可奈何，反正是党的号召，做就是了。这种情况，偶尔发生群众还可以原谅，长此下去那还行？在学校，也要扩大民主生活。教职员工会、学生会，要发挥作用，教职员、学生的意见要能充分表达。学校的负责人，要善于吸收教职员的意见，善于吸收学生的意见。发扬民主不会妨碍统一领导。我们的军队不是最讲集中吗？我们过去打仗也靠军队的民主生活，这对我们统一指挥有什么妨碍呢？对领导管理有什么妨碍呢？只有加强上下团结，事情才更好办嘛。实际上群众参与的事情，即使遇到困难，即使有的搞错了，他们也能忍受，很少埋怨；相反，实行命令主义，搞对了群众也不满意。所以，扩大各方面的民主生活，扩大群众的监督，很重要。
    各党派的“长期共存、互相监督”〔2〕和思想上的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”〔3〕这十六个字，毛主席讲了，我不准备多讲。这里要讲的是我们党内不少人思想不通，不了解它的好处。这十六个字的方针对我们国家有深远的影响，对我们党有极大的好处，对发展马克思列宁主义有很大的好处。如果我们不注意，不搞“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，思想要僵死起来，马克思主义要衰退，只有搞“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，各种意见表达出来，进行争辩，才能真正发展马克思主义，发展辩证唯物主义。这一点，斯大林犯过错误，就是搞得太死了，搞得太单纯了。在苏联，马克思主义在一个时期衰退了。“长期共存、互相监督”也是这样，有监督比没有监督好，一部分人出主意不如大家出主意。共产党总是从一个角度看问题，民主党派就可以从另一个角度看问题，出主意。这样，反映的问题更多，处理问题会更全面，对下决心会更有利，制定的方针政策会比较恰当，即使发生了问题也比较容易纠正。所以，对这十六字方针应当想通。
    现在有的地方不是讲闹事吗？有些人不是讲大民主〔4〕吗？有些青年总觉得大民主解决问题。我们是不赞成搞大民主的。大民主是可以避免的，这就要有小民主。如果没有小民主，那就一定要来大民主。群众有气就要出，我们的办法就是使群众有出气的地方，有说话的地方，有申诉的地方。群众的意见，不外是几种情况，有合理的，合理的就接受，就去做，不做不对，不做就是官僚主义。有一部分基本合理，合理的部分就做，办不到的要解释。有一部分是不合理的，要去做工作，进行说服。总之，要让群众能经常表达自己的意见，在人民代表大会上，政协会议上，职工代表大会上，学生代表大会上，或者在各种场合，使他们有意见就能提，有气就能出。有小民主就不会来大民主。群众把气出了，问题尽可能解决了，怎么还会有大民主呢？怎么还会有罢工罢课呢？大民主我们并不提倡，搞大民主并不好。匈牙利搞大民主〔5〕，要几年才能恢复元气，吃亏的还是人民。波兰搞大民主〔6〕也需要相当一个时期才能恢复元气。所以，大民主不要希望搞，没有什么值得效法的地方。但是，严重的官僚主义者总是会有的，所以有时闹事也是不可避免的。这也不要紧，遇到这种情况要沉住气，要善于面对群众，依靠群众，耐心地去做工作，这样问题就可以解决。
    如果像刚才说的那样去做，我们的党是能够领导的，是不会被打倒的，因为我们同群众在一起，不是用宗派主义的态度对待群众、对待党外人士，不是用官僚主义的态度对待群众，不是用主观主义的态度处理问题。如果我们党过去能领导好，今后还是能领导好。共产党有没有资格领导，这决定于我们党自己。人家承认不承认是另外一回事，不承认也不要紧。如果你合格，人家不承认也合格；如果不合格，人家承认了也还是不合格。归根到底在于我们自己。现在，共产党能不能领导学校，能不能领导科学？现在本事还不大嘛！照毛主席的话，就是又能领导，又不能领导。政治领导，宪法上规定了，看起来还可以，但不是所有的共产党员都行。如果共产党用宗派主义、主观主义、官僚主义的态度领导人家，再说共产党能领导也领导不起来。用正确的方法正确的思想去领导，就会领导得起来，团结得起来。至于哪一个部门的科学，当然是不懂的了。不懂，就团结大家来搞嘛。总之，共产党的领导够不够格，决定于我们党的思想和作风。
    只要党和党员不脱离群众，只要党和党员接受监督，只要党和党员虚心学习，只要党和党员不断地进行工作，进行思想政治工作，我们党就一定能同过去领导革命取得胜利一样，顺利地领导国家建设，在比较短的时间里，学会建设，学会管理经济，把我们国家由落后的农业国建设成为先进的工业国。
