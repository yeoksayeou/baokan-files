The schedule for the fifth Asian Men's Handball Championship and the second Asian Women's Handball Championship has been finalized. The tournaments will kick off tomorrow evening at the Moon Temple Gymnasium.

Five women's teams will compete in a single round-robin format to determine the final standings. China will face Japan on August 21 in their opening match. The nine men's teams will first be divided into three groups for single round-robin matches. The draw results are as follows: Group A: Japan, Chinese Taipei, and Saudi Arabia; Group B: Kuwait, China, and Iran; Group C: South Korea, Qatar, and Hong Kong.

Teams from Nepal, Iraq, Palestine, and India, which had initially registered, have withdrawn due to financial difficulties. Regarding this, the first vice-chairman of the Asian Handball Federation, Abul, revealed that the federation's executive meeting, scheduled for tomorrow morning, will discuss specific penalties such as fines, demotions, and suspension of membership for the associations that did not participate in the competition.

This Asian Handball Championship, held in Beijing, also serves as the qualifying round for the World Handball Championship in the Asian region. Since the South Korean men's and women's teams and the Chinese women's team have already secured their spots in the World A Group Championship, this competition will determine one men's team and two women's teams to participate in the men's A Group and women's B Group World Championships, respectively, to be held in Czechoslovakia and Denmark. According to experts, whether the Chinese men's team can advance will be crucial in their opening match against Kuwait, the third-place team from the previous Asian Championship. If they win, they will have a good chance of advancing. If they lose, the Chinese men's team may face the Olympic silver medalists, South Korea, in the crossover matches, making it difficult for them to enter the top three.

    亚洲手球锦标赛赛程排定
    本报北京8月19日讯　第五届亚洲男子手球锦标赛和第二届亚洲女子手球锦标赛将于明晚在月坛体育馆开幕。
    5支女队将采用单循环赛排定名次，中国队8月21日首战日本队。9支男队先分三组作单循环赛，抽签结果：A组：日本、中国台北和沙特阿拉伯队；B组：科威特、中国和伊朗队；C组：南朝鲜、卡塔尔和香港队。
    原已报名的尼泊尔、伊拉克、巴勒斯坦队和曾表示要参赛的印度队，因经费困难退出比赛。对此，亚手联第一副主席阿布尔透露，预订在明天上午举行的亚手联理事会上，将具体讨论对不参加比赛的协会以罚款、降级和停止会籍等处分。
    这次在北京举行的亚洲手球锦标赛，同时也是世界手球锦标赛亚洲区的预选赛。由于南朝鲜男女队和中国女队已经取得参加世界A组锦标赛资格，这次比赛将产生一支男队和两支女队，分别参加在捷克斯洛伐克和丹麦举行的男子A组和女子B组世界锦标赛。据行家分析，中国男队能否出线，明晚揭幕战与上届亚洲锦标赛第三名科威特队之争甚为关键。如能取胜，便很有希望开通道路。若失利，则中国男队极可能在交叉赛中碰上奥运会亚军南朝鲜队，其后果将难以进入前三名。　（汪大昭　吴小远）
