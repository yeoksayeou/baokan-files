Title: Discussing Prices in Haikou

Haikou, the capital of Hainan Province, immediately entangles visitors in a web of prices upon arrival.

First, let's talk about food. In agricultural markets, a kilogram of fresh lean pork costs 14 to 15 yuan, while a kilogram of green vegetables costs 1.5 to 1.6 yuan. Some restaurants charge 16 to 17 yuan for a bowl of stir-fried noodles.

Clothing prices are also quite high: a regular men's pair of trousers, with nothing special about them, costs 170 yuan; an ordinary shirt costs 120 yuan; a belt costs 150 yuan. The high prices are justified by the so-called "brand name." But most of these "brand names" are counterfeit. Almost all taxis have signs of overcharging, especially at the airport and docks. Taxi drivers often jack up their prices. For a distance of three to four kilometers, the fare can be as low as 10 yuan or as high as 15 yuan, several times the regulated price.

In Haikou's markets, from small items like toothpaste and soap to large items like cameras, color TVs, and VCRs, the prices for the same goods vary greatly, with differences ranging from a few cents to a few hundred yuan. Many tourists and business travelers unwittingly get cheated out of their money. Some stores and stalls even openly keep the change they should return to customers, using the excuse of "not having any small change."

In the first half of this year, Hainan's price index rose by 39.8%, far exceeding the national average. Prices are too high, not only making it difficult for long-term residents to cope, but also directly affecting its development and construction.

    海口论价
    海南省会海口，人们一临此地，便马上被卷入物价的缠绕之中。
    先说吃的。农贸市场上，一公斤鲜瘦猪肉十四五元钱，一公斤青菜一块五六毛钱。有的餐馆一碗炒面就收十六七元钱。
    穿的衣服，价格也很邪乎：一件男式长裤，并无什么特殊之处，竟要价170元；一件普通衬衣要120元；一条腰带要150元。价格高就高在所谓“名牌”上。但“名牌”大多假冒。几乎所有的出租车都有超标准收费的迹象，在飞机场、码头等处，出租车司机往往大涨其价。三四公里远，收费少则10元，多则15元，高出规定价格数倍。
    海口市场上的商品，小到牙膏、香皂，大到照相机、彩电、录像机等，同样商品都没有统一价格，差价从几分钱到一二百元不等。而许多游客、出差公干的，在不知不觉中就被骗了钱去。有些商店、摊点，还常以“没有零钱找”为由，公然将理应找还给顾客的零钱攫为己有。
    今年上半年，海南物价指数上升达39.8％，大大超过全国水平。物价太高，不仅久居这里的人吃不消，而且直接影响到它的发展和建设。　（7月29日《深圳特区报》姜恩宇文）
