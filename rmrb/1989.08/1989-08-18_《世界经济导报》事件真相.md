Edition: 4

The "World Economic Herald" (hereinafter referred to as the "Herald") actively advocated for bourgeois liberalization, creating a wave of public opinion for the political turmoil that started as a student movement and escalated into the Beijing counterrevolutionary rebellion. At the outset of the student movement, the "Herald" used the newspaper's influence to openly challenge the Party Central Committee. After the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to rectify it, a few individuals within the newspaper not only failed to repent but instead deliberately expanded the situation. They collaborated with anti-Communist and anti-socialist forces, both domestically and internationally, making the "Herald" a significant source of the Shanghai turmoil and a loudspeaker in the international chorus of reactionary forces inciting and supporting the turmoil in China.

The "Herald" used the pretext of "news freedom" and "daring to speak the truth" to oppose the Four Cardinal Principles. It also presented itself as a "victim" of rectification, deceiving the public. Therefore, it is necessary to expose the truth about the "Herald" incident to the public, so that everyone can see the true nature of the "Herald" incident and the role played by the few individuals within the "Herald" who stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engaged in political conspiracies during this turmoil.

The core of the original 439th issue of the "Herald" was to publicly propose a political program for the turmoil.

On April 15, a few anti-Party and anti-socialist conspirators took advantage of the public's mourning for Comrade Hu Yaobang to plot, organize, and instigate political turmoil. The few individuals within the "Herald" were also quick to act, sensing the political opportunity. Zhang Weiguo, a member of the editorial board and head of the Beijing office, wrote in his work diary: "Hu Yaobang's death is a good turning point, a turning point that can change the current situation." On the same day, Zhang Weiguo contacted Guo Yang, the editor-in-chief of "New Observation" magazine, and Su Shaozhi, among others, to "inquire about the reactions of relevant individuals." Guo Yang immediately spread rumors, saying, "Hu Yaobang was suffocated to death! The reformers met such an end!"

On April 19, the "Herald" and "New Observation" jointly held a "Memorial Symposium for Comrade Hu Yaobang." Before the symposium, the editor-in-chief of the "Herald," Qin Benli, instructed from Shanghai: "The content must be substantial, not just a general statement." The list of participants was, of course, carefully selected.

During the symposium, a few representatives of bourgeois liberalization spoke. They ignored the facts and incited that Hu Yaobang "received unfair treatment," his resignation was a "tragedy" in the Party's history, and even after his death, he did not receive the title of "great Marxist." They demanded a "fair evaluation" of Hu Yaobang. They openly overturned the "Elimination of Spiritual Pollution" and "Opposition to Bourgeois Liberalization" campaigns, saying that even among the people at the grassroots level, the "anti-liberalization movement" was "unpopular." Someone even proposed to "make a fair evaluation of certain movements in 1986," and so on. Comrade Li Peng pointed out in his analysis of the initial stage of the turmoil: "During this period, the instigators of the turmoil used the student movement to propose a series of political demands with a programmatic nature, the most important of which were two: one was to re-evaluate Comrade Hu Yaobang's merits and demerits and completely negate the Central Committee's handling of Comrade Hu Yaobang's resignation in early 1987; the second was to completely negate the opposition to bourgeois liberalization and to rehabilitate those who were said to have suffered unjustly in the anti-liberalization campaign." It was this symposium organized by the "Herald" that first clearly and prominently proposed these two political programs.

Surrounding the above political demands, these individuals openly directed their attacks at Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the Party Central Committee. They slandered Comrade Deng Xiaoping as having forgotten the people and become detached from them. Yan Jiaqi even threatened the Party Central Committee, saying, "You must admit your mistakes selflessly," and "if you do not admit your mistakes, a repeat of past mistakes is imminent." Dai Qing talked at length about the 70-year history of the Communist Party of China, about the fate of several General Secretaries, saying that the Party's General Secretaries all met with bad ends, all were "non-procedural power transfers," implying that now they should fully "protect" Comrade Zhao Ziyang. In short, "overthrow Deng, protect Zhao."

At that time, the student movement had already begun. Some individuals at the symposium eagerly incited students and the masses to take to the streets, saying that "China's cohesion" was in Tiananmen Square, and "China's future and hope" were in Tiananmen Square. They, as scholars and celebrities, added fuel to the fire of the student movement.

From the above, it can be seen that this symposium not only provided a platform for those who adhered to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engaged in political conspiracies to challenge the Party Central Committee but also conducted public opinion guidance for creating this turmoil.

For this symposium, Qin Benli and others took a series of unusual measures: instructing Zhang Weiguo to carefully compile all the speeches of the participants and prepare to publish them in full in several columns; deciding to print the "Herald" one day in advance to send the newspaper to Beijing on the day of Comrade Hu Yaobang's memorial service; and leaking the reporting plan to overseas. Thus, an overseas newspaper revealed two days before the symposium, on April 17, that the "Herald" would report the important contents of this symposium in a special column.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department learned of this information from overseas publications and, on April 21, the responsible comrade in charge of propaganda work from the Municipal Committee met with Qin Benli in the afternoon, requesting to see the proofs. The next day, after the responsible comrade from the Municipal Committee saw the proofs, he immediately met with Qin Benli again and sincerely but seriously pointed out that publishing opinions in the newspaper that contradicted the Central Committee's official decisions was not allowed by propaganda discipline. Especially at a time when students had already taken to the streets, if the contents of some speeches at this symposium were published, it would have a wrong guiding effect on public opinion and would be detrimental to stabilizing the current situation. Therefore, the responsible comrade from the Municipal Committee, for the sake of the overall situation and also to protect the "Herald," suggested deleting several hundred words, mainly the speeches of Yan Jiaqi, Dai Qing, and others who adhered to bourgeois liberalization. However, Qin Benli insisted on not deleting these sentences that opposed the Party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping. When the leading comrade asked him why he insisted on publishing these contents, he revealed the truth: "I want Deng Xiaoping to make a self-criticism. If Deng Xiaoping makes a self-criticism early, takes the initiative, and wins the hearts of the people, we will support him."

In this situation, Jiang Zemin, then Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally met with Qin Benli and severely criticized Qin Benli's wrong views and disregard for the Party's political discipline, organizational discipline, and propaganda discipline. He pointed out that these contents must be deleted and requested an old comrade who served as the honorary chairman of the "Herald" to do the work together. In this situation, Qin Benli finally agreed to delete the contents. However, the matter was not so simple. In fact, while sending the proofs to the Municipal Committee for review, he had already ordered the printing of the 439th issue of the newspaper containing the contents of this symposium. Therefore, when Qin Benli was delaying time with the Municipal Committee leaders, more than 160,000 copies of the newspaper had already been completely printed, and several hundred copies had been sent out in advance, some of which had already been sent to Beijing.

The Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department learned of this and, on the afternoon of April 23, agreed with Qin Benli to: stop the distribution of this issue of the "Herald" containing bourgeois liberalization speeches (referred to as Version A) and compile Version B. In theory, such a limited scope of revision could be completed in half a day, still ensuring that the "Herald" was published on time. However, three whole days passed, and the 439th issue of Version B was still not printed. During this period, the Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department called several times to urge, but they could never find Qin Benli and the relevant editorial staff. Now the truth is revealed: originally, on the evening of April 23, Qin Benli held an editorial board meeting at his home. Some editorial board members opposed the publication of Version B and insisted on continuing the distribution of Version A. Finally, Qin Benli summarized his speech, saying: "I originally thought there was nothing wrong. The deleted contents are exactly what our newspaper wants to say." They then informed Zhang Weiguo in Beijing to leak this news to overseas news agencies. Sure enough, on April 24, the Hong Kong "South China Morning Post" first released a distorted report that the "Herald" had been "seized and confiscated." On the evening of April 24, Qin Benli held another editorial board meeting at his home and decided to write an "urgent report" to the Shanghai Municipal Committee. Following that, Qin Benli hid in the Cherry Blossom Resort "to recuperate." As they privately revealed to the Hong Kong "Ming Pao": "The longer we can delay, the greater the victory for the 'Herald'," "The 'Herald' incident has already had an international impact." In this way, they delayed until the evening of April 25. The editorial department of the "Herald" wrote another "urgent report" and sent it to the Municipal Committee. The report said that due to the 439th issue of Version A causing a strong international reaction, and also spreading rumors that "according to news from Beijing, the Central Committee may re-evaluate Comrade Hu Yaobang," they insisted on distributing the 439th issue of "Version A," attempting to use international and "Beijing" pressure to force the Shanghai Municipal Committee to surrender. This urgent report was "for your information," which means they intended to act arbitrarily.

From the above facts, it is clear that the "Herald" organizing this symposium and stubbornly insisting on distributing the 439th issue of Version A was a planned and premeditated action.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee, based on the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" on April 26, decisively made the decision to suspend Qin Benli and rectify the "Herald." On the afternoon of April 26, the Shanghai Municipal Committee held a "Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" mass cadre meeting, where Comrade Jiang Zemin announced the Municipal Committee's decision and sternly pointed out: "Currently, some people are trying to use overseas public opinion to exert pressure on us, which is absolutely impossible and will not shake our determination to maintain stability and unity."

The entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause, expressing support and approval.

A significant source of the Shanghai turmoil

The correct decision of the Shanghai Municipal Committee disrupted the plans of the instigators of the turmoil, but they did not stop there. Instead, they deliberately expanded the incident. A serious confrontation between expanding the turmoil and opposing the turmoil began. The struggle first manifested in the rectification and resistance to the rectification of the "Herald."

Even before the Shanghai Municipal Committee decided to rectify the "Herald," on April 25, the Beijing office of the "Herald" sent a letter to Qin Benli and others, threatening "interveners" in a menacing tone, saying: "If you insist on acting arbitrarily, we will also take to the streets and seek the support of the people and readers," claiming that "facing a severe test, the 'Herald' staff can only move forward and not retreat." This was the first confession in the news industry to propose "taking to the streets."

On April 27, the rectification leading group of the Shanghai Municipal Committee entered the "Herald." At that time, the primary task of the rectification leading group was to organize the newspaper staff to quickly publish a newspaper that firmly supports national stability and use facts to dispel the lies of certain people with ulterior motives at home and abroad that the "Herald" had been seized. However, this effort was met with all kinds of resistance from a few individuals within the "Herald" from the start. A member of the editorial board, known as the "clever one" of the "Herald," said: "We are not after the six characters 'World Economic Herald,' but after the 'World Economic Herald' with independent content and style as before. If the content and style change, the 'Herald' will die, and the 'Herald' staff will only fight to the death." "The only way to solve the 'Herald' problem is for the Municipal Committee to admit its mistakes, the boss (note: the 'Herald' staff's term for Qin Benli) to resume his position, and the rectification group to withdraw." Therefore, from the deputy editor-in-chief to the editorial board members, all refused to sign off on the proofs for printing. Under the leadership of the rectification leading group, the 439th issue of Version B was finally printed and distributed on April 27. Later, although the rectification leading group had objections to some contents of the 440th issue, considering that publishing the newspaper was the key at that time, they still signed off. But when the newspaper came out, the originally planned full-page headline "Commemorating May Fourth" was changed to "We need an environment where we can freely speak the truth." This was the trick played by a few individuals within the "Herald" after the rectification leading group signed off. This headline became a prominent banner and slogan in the student parade the next day. Later, in the process of editing and publishing the 441st and 442nd issues of the newspaper, a few individuals within the "Herald" created various incidents, increasingly attempting to guide public opinion towards the turmoil. The rectification leading group naturally refused to sign off and repeatedly tried to persuade them to modify, but they were repeatedly rejected. The "Herald" was unable to publish from the 442nd issue onwards.

It has now been confirmed that the background of a few individuals within the "Herald" doing this came from Beijing. Zhang Weiguo received instructions from the Political System Reform Research Office controlled by Bao Tong, saying: "If the 'Herald' is not stopped, Beijing will not feel the pressure. If it is stopped, Beijing will feel the pressure and may come out and speak." Zhang Weiguo immediately passed on this instruction to Shanghai. Thus, it is not difficult to understand why the "Herald" stopped publishing from the 442nd issue onwards. "Beijing may come out and speak" in the "Beijing" refers to whom? Now the truth is revealed: originally, after returning from a visit to North Korea, Comrade Zhao Ziyang learned of the Shanghai Municipal Committee's decision to handle the "Herald" and not only did not support it but was also "shocked," criticizing the Shanghai Municipal Committee for "messing things up" and "being passive."

With such "Beijing" support, the few individuals within the "Herald" naturally acted with impunity, expanding the situation into the entire social turmoil.

After the Shanghai Municipal Committee decided to rectify the "Herald," to expand the situation, Qin Benli immediately called Zhang Weiguo to understand the views of the participants in the symposium on the rectification of the "Herald." Zhang Weiguo immediately contacted Yan Jiaqi, Dai Qing, and others. On April 27, Yan Jiaqi claimed in a phone call that "the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Committee is wrong, and this must be clearly opposed. The 'Herald' should continue to be published according to its original principles and style (note: actually according to bourgeois liberalization thoughts) and should clearly expose Jiang Zemin's wrong decision in the newspaper." Yan Jiaqi immediately drafted an open letter to the Shanghai Municipal Committee, with a sensational title: "Defending News Freedom," initially signed by only Yan Jiaqi and one other person. Later, after Zhang Weiguo and Dai Qing incited at a Beijing intellectual symposium, 30 more people signed, including Bao Zhenxin, Su Shaozhi, Yu Haocheng, Zhang Xianyang, and Su Xiaokang. This was the first letter of support for the "Herald," and also a farce self-directed and self-performed by a few individuals within the "Herald."

Qin Benli, who had been suspended, did not actually stop working. He often held editorial board meetings at home or in hotels to discuss how to expand the situation. They produced a "Statement on the Decision of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to Rectify the 'World Economic Herald' (Factual Truth, Our Attitude, and Requirements)" in early May, which was a document full of distortions of facts. After Qin Benli reviewed and approved it, it was mass-produced and distributed to various sectors of society, stirring up a wave of support for the "Herald" in society.

From April 29, a few individuals within the "Herald" began to hang black cloth along the walls of the editorial office and posted "support" letters from various domestic and international sources on the black cloth. This was actually a form of demonstration and exhibition, aiming to mobilize various sectors of society to visit and support. Qin Benli personally called overseas newspaper reporters to visit. He said: "You will feel that the news industry has awakened, become independent, and united." For a while, people flocked to the editorial office of the "Herald" to visit, deceiving many who were unaware of the truth and influenced by them, playing a role in inciting social turmoil.

The head of the Beijing office of the "Herald," Zhang Weiguo, was even more active. He gave speeches in Beijing's news industry and among students, at various intellectual gatherings, introducing the so-called "truth" of the "Herald" incident, reminding the news industry to "fully awaken their subject consciousness."

What awakening? Zhang Weiguo's conversation during an interview with the Hong Kong "Mirror Monthly" magazine provided the best explanation: "The 'Herald' incident made the Chinese news industry awaken, which is the victory. To start anew, the Chinese mass media will definitely turn over a new page in history." On May 4, a few people in the capital's news industry took to the streets with the banners of "news freedom" and "support the 'Herald'."

As the overall situation developed, a few individuals within the "Herald" became even more brazen, actively participating in and supporting the turmoil. On May 13, Qin Benli and others held a meeting at the Jinjiang Hotel to discuss the situation and strategy. They believed that the situation was "very favorable," and it was time for a major "transition." In their words: "The situation we face may be a very important transition period, the depth of which and the consequences of which are difficult to estimate, and there may be great significance that we have not yet recognized." They simply refused to publish the newspaper but instead focused all their efforts on coordinating with the north, creating and expanding the turmoil in Shanghai.

On May 11, a few individuals within the "Herald" gathered some people to draft a "Shanghai Intellectuals' Appeal," proposing five demands: to withdraw the handling of the "Herald," to withdraw the rectification leading group sent to the "Herald," to restore Comrade Qin Benli's position, to restore the distribution of the banned April 24 issue of the "Herald," and to ensure news freedom and affirm and protect students' patriotic and democratic actions. The contents of the "Appeal" quickly appeared in overseas newspapers.

On May 16 and 18, a few individuals within the "Herald" held press conferences and press briefings for foreign journalists, inviting officials from the American consulate and nearly 20 university student organizations to participate, deliberately expanding the "Herald" incident to both domestic and international levels. They issued a statement saying: "We do not just see the incident at the 'Herald' as a matter of one person or one newspaper. We hope to work with the students to promote China's democratic construction and political reform."

A few individuals within the "Herald" have always claimed to "dare to speak the truth," but see how they "dared" to spread rumors during the turmoil to muddy the waters? On May 18, someone called the "Herald" asking, "We heard that three students in Beijing died from hunger strikes, is it true?" The "Herald" staff replied, "Our Beijing office has confirmed it, three died." This rumor, after being "confirmed" by the "Herald," quickly spread, further inflaming the emotions of students and citizens. For a while, the parade carried wreaths, banners, and wore black cloth, causing chaos.

To expand the turmoil, a few individuals within the "Herald" frequently appeared on university campuses, making connections, giving speeches, and establishing regular contact with illegal organizations such as the Shanghai "High Autonomy Federation." For this, the head of the illegal student organization at Fudan University even wrote a letter thanking the "Herald" teachers for their "valuable guidance." A few individuals within the "Herald" bought a large number of bread and drinks to comfort the marching students, boosting their morale. They gave speeches in the parade, inciting trouble. The four phones of the "Herald" (including international direct-dial phones) were on duty 24 hours a day, receiving information from Beijing and overseas and transmitting it to Shanghai's universities and relevant departments, and then transmitting Shanghai's information overseas. No wonder there was a saying among the students at that time: "For the latest news, listen to the 'Herald'; for theoretical guidance, find the 'Herald'."

However, a few individuals within the "Herald," like all other instigators of the turmoil, misjudged the situation and underestimated the strength of the Party and the people. On May 19, Comrade Li Peng, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, delivered a stern and inspiring speech. On May 20, the State Council issued the order to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing. Qin Benli and others realized that their end was near but were unwilling to admit defeat, still making a final desperate struggle.

Before the martial law order was issued, the Economic System Reform Research Institute, the Agricultural Research Center of the State Council, the International Issues Research Institute of China International Trust and Investment Corporation, and the Beijing Youth Economic Society issued the "Six-Point Opinion" on the current situation, openly exposing the differences in opinions within the Party Central Committee on the student movement and turmoil. They also used the name "People's Daily Extra" to distribute it to society. A few individuals within the "Herald" immediately responded, also producing an "extra," with the contents including the "Six-Point Opinion" and Cao Siyuan's article "Let Non-Violent Ideology Penetrate the Hearts of the People," directly targeting the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the People's Liberation Army. It was only because the superior leaders of the printing plant discovered and took measures in time that this "extra" did not see the light of day.

On May 21, a few individuals within the "Herald" posted 30 photos under the title "May 20, Tiananmen Square" in the "Herald" reading column outside the newspaper office, propagating the situation where the instigators of the turmoil blocked the PLA from entering the city, opposed martial law, and occupied Tiananmen Square, holding up reactionary slogans such as "Overthrow Li Peng," causing a crowd to gather and the road to be blocked. This reactionary propaganda actually mobilized thoughts for the later serious turmoil in Shanghai, such as setting up traffic barriers.

Cao Siyuan and Hu Jiuwei in Beijing organized National People's Congress Standing Committee members to sign a petition to convene an emergency meeting of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, attempting to "remove Li Peng." After learning of this, a few individuals within the "Herald" immediately took action. On the afternoon of May 21, Qin Benli and others hid in a hotel to secretly draft an "Open Letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from Shanghai Communist Party Members." The letter openly demanded to negate the People's Daily editorial on April 26, oppose the State Council's order to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing, and "withdraw" Comrade Li Peng's speech on May 19, exerting pressure on the Party Central Committee. They went out to collect signatures from party members, and after facing resistance from the majority of party members, they had to make up the numbers with non-party members, and then hurriedly telexed to Beijing and leaked to overseas, creating the illusion of "Shanghai Communist Party members also taking action."

On May 22, a few individuals within the "Herald" actively made connections and organized a large parade in Shanghai to support Beijing and oppose martial law, according to information from Beijing. Some individuals within the "Herald" wrote reactionary banners such as "Overthrow the Li-Yang Anti-Party Clique" and "Completely Crush Li Peng's Anti-Party, Anti-People Coup Plot." They openly held up banners such as "Remove Li Peng" in the parade and shouted reactionary slogans such as "Overthrow Li Peng." Qin Benli, with a "white-haired, slow-footed" appearance, participated in the parade and became one of the most eye-catching scenes in this parade.

A few individuals within the "Herald" did not hesitate to associate with reactionary elements, openly maintaining close contact with the notorious reactionary organization "China Democracy League." Qin Benli and others also sought help from overseas reactionary propaganda tools to exert pressure on the Party and the government. A few individuals within the "Herald" frequently accepted interviews from overseas news reporters. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Western propaganda tools published numerous articles about the "Herald," advocating for a few individuals within the "Herald." According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 300 reports on this aspect. Just one Hong Kong newspaper had more than 40 news reports about the "Herald" from April 25 to June 17.

After the Beijing counterrevolutionary rebellion was suppressed, a few individuals within the "Herald" still resisted. After June 4, some news agencies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the West fabricated rumors such as "Massacre at Tiananmen" and "Black June 4." A few individuals within the "Herald" actually copied, distributed, and posted these reactionary materials. They also wanted the "Herald" staff to wear black armbands and twice attempted to organize parades, both of which were resisted by the "Herald" staff. Until June 9, about 20 people from the "Herald" still participated in the "memorial service" organized by illegal organizations such as the Shanghai "High Autonomy Federation" at People's Square and planned to hold a press conference at the square. However, under the leadership of the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government, the people of Shanghai firmly stopped the turmoil, and this press conference became a bubble.

A profound lesson

Was the "Herald"'s performance in this turmoil accidental? No.

The "Herald" was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department to be published in June 1980 and was under the management of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Since its establishment, the "Herald" had published some good articles in promoting reform and opening up. However, at the same time, under the erroneous guidance of the editor-in-chief Qin Benli, the "Herald" also published many erroneous articles and had been criticized multiple times by the Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee. The relevant departments of the Shanghai Municipal Committee had sent personnel to rectify it twice in 1985 and 1987. Qin Benli had also made multiple self-criticisms. However, Comrade Zhao Ziyang always supported and protected the "Herald." For example, at the critical moment of rectifying the "Herald" in 1987, his secretary visited the "Herald" to express sympathy, making the rectification work impossible to continue, and thus, the "Herald" problem was never fundamentally solved. The Shanghai Municipal Committee had sent some comrades to strengthen the leadership of the "Herald," but they were all expelled by Qin Benli with impunity. Especially in the past two years, the "Herald" had followed the international and domestic trends, publishing more and more articles that violated and opposed the Four Cardinal Principles, quickly sliding down the road of bourgeois liberalization.

The nature of the "Herald" incident is serious, and the lessons are profound, requiring a thorough and comprehensive summary and reflection. It tells us that the struggle with a few individuals within the "Herald" who adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engage in political conspiracies is not a struggle over whether to reform the news industry but a sharp struggle between adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization, a political struggle between turmoil and anti-turmoil. It also tells people that in our country, any propaganda tool that breaks away from the Party's leadership and deviates from the socialist direction will inevitably fall into the quagmire of bourgeois liberalization. News reform, if it departs from the premise of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, will inevitably be a flood of bourgeois liberalization thoughts. This is not something that can be changed by human subjective will.

    《世界经济导报》事件真相
    忻华实
    《世界经济导报》（以下称《导报》）积极鼓吹资产阶级自由化，为这场由学潮到动乱，进而发展成为北京反革命暴乱的政治风波造了一番舆论。在学潮之初，《导报》利用报纸的舆论导向作用，首先公开向党中央发难。在中共上海市委决定对它进行整顿后，报社极少数人不仅不幡然悔悟，相反，蓄意扩大事态，与敌视共产党和社会主义的势力南北呼应，内外勾结，使《导报》成为上海动乱的一个重要策源地，成为海内外反动势力在中国煽动和支持动乱的大合唱中一个刺耳的喇叭。
    《导报》是打着所谓“新闻自由”、“敢说真话”的幌子反对四项基本原则的，又以被整顿的“受害者”的面目四处招摇，具有极大的欺骗性。因此，有必要把《导报》事件的真相公之于众，让大家看一看《导报》事件的实质到底是什么，《导报》中极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人在这次动乱中究竟扮演了什么角色。
    原439期《导报》的要害是公开提出动乱政治纲领
    4月15日，胡耀邦同志逝世，极少数反党反社会主义的阴谋分子利用广大学生和人民群众对胡耀邦同志的悼念之情，阴谋策划、组织和发动政治动乱。《导报》的极少数人凭他们特殊的政治敏感，也立即行动起来。《导报》编委、北京办事处负责人张伟国在他的工作日志中写道：“胡耀邦逝世，是一个很好的转机，是可以改变当前情况的转机”。当日，张伟国即与《新观察》杂志主编戈扬，以及苏绍智等人联系，“打听有关人士反应”。戈扬当时就造谣说：“耀邦是被气死的！改革者竟如此下场！”4月19日，《导报》与《新观察》联合召开“追悼胡耀邦同志座谈会”。《导报》总编辑钦本立在此之前从上海“指示”：“内容要有分量，不是一般表态性的”。参加者名单当然是经过精心选择的。
    座谈会上，几个坚持资产阶级自由化的代表人物发言。他们不顾事实真相，煽动说耀邦“受到不公正待遇”，他的辞职是党的历史上一大“悲剧”，甚至死了连“伟大的马克思主义者”称号也没有。他们要求重新“对耀邦作出公正评价”。他们公开翻“清除精神污染”、“反对资产阶级自由化”的案，说什么“反自由化运动”甚至在最基层的人民当中也“不得人心”。有人还提出“要对1986年的某些运动作出公正的评价”，等等。李鹏同志在分析动乱初期的形势时指出：“这个时期，动乱制造者们通过学潮提出了一系列带纲领性的政治要求，其中最主要的是两条：一是重新评价胡耀邦同志的功过，彻底否定1987年初中央对胡耀邦同志辞职的处理；二是彻底否定反对资产阶级自由化，为在反自由化中所谓‘蒙受不白之冤的公民’平反昭雪。”正是《导报》召开的这个座谈会，首先鲜明地集中地提出了这两个政治纲领。
    围绕上述政治要求，这些人在发言中公开地把矛头指向邓小平同志和党中央。他们诬蔑邓小平同志已经忘了人民、脱离人民了。严家其更向党中央要挟道：“要无私地承认自己的错误”，“如果不承认错误，重蹈覆辙就在眼前”。戴晴则大谈中国共产党70年的历史，大谈几位总书记的命运，说什么党的总书记都没有好下场，都是“非程序权力更迭”，暗示现在要全力“保”赵紫阳同志。一句话，“倒邓保赵”。
    当时，学潮已起。座谈会上有些人竭力鼓动学生和群众进一步走向街头，说什么“中国的凝聚力”在天安门广场，“中国的前途和希望”在天安门广场。他们以学者、名人的身份给学潮火上加油。
    由上可见，这个座谈会既为坚持资产阶级自由化立场和搞政治阴谋的人提供了一个向党中央发难的讲坛，又为制造这场动乱进行舆论导向。
    对这次座谈会，钦本立等人采取了一系列异乎寻常的做法：指示张伟国详细整理所有发言人的讲话，准备以几版篇幅全文发表；决定《导报》提前一天印刷，赶在胡耀邦同志追悼会举行那天把报纸发往北京；把报道方案预先捅到海外。于是，海外一家报纸在座谈会前两天，即4月17日就透露，《导报》将用专栏报道这次座谈会的重要内容。
    上海市委宣传部从海外报刊上获悉这个信息后，由市委主管宣传工作的负责同志于4月21日下午约见钦本立，要求看清样。第二天市委负责同志看了清样后立即再约钦本立谈话，诚恳而又严肃地指出，在报纸上公开发表与中央正式决定相悖的意见是宣传纪律所不允许的。尤其在当前学生已经上街的情况下，这个座谈会的部分发言内容如发表出去，会起到错误的舆论导向作用，对稳定当前局势不利。因此，市委负责同志从维护大局出发，也是为了爱护《导报》，建议删节数百字，主要是严家其、戴晴等人坚持资产阶级自由化的发言内容。但钦本立坚持不肯删节这些反对党中央和邓小平同志的语句。当领导同志追问他为什么要坚持发表这些内容时，他一语道破天机：“我就是要邓小平检讨。邓小平早检讨，早主动，早得人心。他要检讨，我们就拥护他。”
    在这种情况下，当时任中共上海市委书记的江泽民亲自找钦本立谈话，严肃批评了钦本立的错误观点和无视党的政治纪律、组织纪律和宣传纪律的行为，指出这些内容非删节不可，同时请担任《导报》名誉理事长的一位老同志一起做工作。在这种情况下，钦本立最后总算同意删节了。可是事情并非这么简单，实际上他在将清样送市委审阅的同时，就已下令开机印刷刊登这次座谈会内容的439期报纸了。所以，当钦本立在与市委领导拖延时间时，16万多份报纸已经全部印好，并有几百份提前抢送和抢发出去，有的已送往北京了。
    市委宣传部得知后，于4月23日下午与钦本立商定：这期刊有坚持资产阶级自由化言论的《导报》（称做A版）停发，另编B版。按理，这种有限篇幅的改版半天就可以了，仍可保证《导报》如期正常出版。但是此后整整三天过去，439期B版仍未付印。在此期间，市委宣传部多次打电话催促，但始终找不到钦本立及有关编辑人员。现在真相大白：原来4月23日晚钦本立在家中召开编委会，一些编委反对出B版，坚持继续发行A版，最后钦本立总结发言说：“我本来就认为没有什么错。这些删去的内容正是我们报纸要说的。”于是，他们又电告在北京的张伟国把这个消息捅到海外新闻单位去。果然，4月24日香港《南华早报》首先发出《导报》被“查封没收”的歪曲报道。24日晚，钦本立在家中再次召开编委会，决定给上海市委写一份《紧急报告》，接着，钦本立就躲到樱花渡假村“养病”去了。正如他们私下向香港《明报》透露的：“能多拖一天，就是《导报》的胜利”，“《导报》事件已形成国际影响了”。就这样拖到了4月25日晚上，《导报》编辑部竟又写了一份《紧急报告》送到了市委。报告说鉴于439期A版问题已引起国际上强烈反响，同时造谣说：“据北京消息，中央有可能对耀邦同志重新作结论”，因此坚持要发行439期“A版”，企图用国际的和“北京”的压力，迫使上海市委屈服。这份紧急报告是“专此奉告”，这就是说他们要一意孤行了。
    从以上大量事实可见，《导报》组织这个座谈会，并顽固坚持发行439期A版，完全是一个有计划、有预谋的行动。
    上海市委根据4月26日人民日报《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》的社论精神，果断地作出关于钦本立停职和整顿《导报》的决定。4月26日下午，上海市委召开“旗帜鲜明反对动乱”的万人干部大会，江泽民同志在会上宣布了市委的决定，并义正辞严地指出：“当前，有人企图利用海外舆论，对我们施加压力，这是绝对办不到的，也决不能动摇我们维护安定团结的决心。”
    全场报以热烈的掌声，表示拥护与支持。
    上海动乱的一个重要策源地
    上海市委的正确决定，打乱了动乱制造者的阵脚，但是他们并不因此而止步，相反，蓄意扩大事端。一场扩大动乱与反对动乱的严重较量就此展开。斗争首先表现在对《导报》的整顿与反整顿上。
    早在上海市委作出整顿《导报》决定的前一天，即4月25日，《导报》北京办事处就给钦本立等人写去一封信，以恫吓的口吻警告“非法干预者”说：“如一意孤行，我们也将走上街头，争取人民和读者的支持”，声称“面临严峻考验，导报全体同人只能前进，不能后退”。这是新闻界第一份提出“走上街头”的自白书。
    4月27日，上海市委整顿领导小组进驻《导报》。当时整顿领导小组的首要任务是组织报社职工尽快出版坚决拥护国家安定的报纸，用事实打破国内外某些别有用心者制造的《导报》被查封的谎言。但是这种努力一开始就受到《导报》极少数人的百般抵制。一名被称为《导报》“智多星”的编委说：“我们不是要‘世界经济导报’这6个字，而是要像以往一样独立内容独立风格的《世界经济导报》，如果内容风格变了，《导报》就死亡了，《导报》同人只能冲一个鱼死网破”。“解决《导报》的唯一办法就是市委承认错误，老板（按：《导报》职工对钦本立的称呼）复职，撤出整顿小组”。因此，从副总编辑到编委均拒绝签发清样付印。在整顿领导小组主持下，439期B版终于在4月27日付印发行。以后，整顿领导小组尽管对440期一些内容有异议，但考虑到在当时出报是大局，还是签发了。但报纸出来一看，原来定的第一版的通栏大标题“纪念五四”却被篡改成“我们需要一个自由地讲真话的环境”。这是《导报》极少数人在整顿领导小组签发后做的手脚。这个大标题，第二天就成为上海学生游行队伍中显眼的横幅和口号。以后在编发441、442期报纸过程中，《导报》极少数人又制造种种事端，越来越明显地企图对动乱进行舆论导向，整顿领导小组理所当然地拒绝签发，并一再努力耐心说服他们修改，但一再遭到拒绝。《导报》从442期起就无法出版了。
    现在已经查明，《导报》极少数人这样干的背景来自北京。张伟国从鲍彤控制的政治体制改革研究室得到指令说：“《导报》没有停掉，北京感觉不到压力。如果停办了，北京就会感到压力，就可能出来讲话了”。张伟国立即将此指令传到上海。这样，《导报》自442期起停出就不难理解了。“北京就可能出来讲话了”中的“北京”指的是谁？现在已真相大白：原来，访朝回京的赵紫阳同志得悉上海市委对《导报》的处理决定后，不仅不予支持，反而感到“震惊”，指责上海市委把事情“搞糟”了，“搞被动”了。
    有了这种“北京”的支持，《导报》极少数人自然有恃无恐地把事态扩大到整个社会动乱中去。
    在上海市委关于整顿《导报》的决定作出后，为了把事态扩大，钦本立立即打电话给张伟国，要他了解参加座谈会的人对《导报》被整顿的看法。张伟国马上与严家其、戴晴等人联系。4月27日，严家其在电话中声称“上海市委的决定是错误的，对此必须旗帜鲜明地进行斗争。《导报》应按原来的宗旨风格（按：实际上是按资产阶级自由化思想）照样出版，而且应在报上鲜明地揭露江泽民的错误决定”。严家其立即起草了一封给上海市委的《公开信》，并冠以耸人听闻的标题：“捍卫新闻自由”，一开始，在信上签名者仅严家其等两人。后来，经过张伟国和戴晴在北京一个知识分子座谈会上鼓动，才又有30多人签名，其中就有包遵信、苏绍智、于浩成、张显扬、苏晓康等人。这就是第一份声援《导报》的函电，也是《导报》极少数人自编自导的一出闹剧。
    已被停职的钦本立根本没有“停职”，他不时在家中或借宾馆召开编委会，讨论如何扩大事态。他们于5月初炮制出一份《对中共上海市委整顿〈世界经济导报〉“决定”的陈述（事实真相，我们的态度和要求）》，这份通篇歪曲事实的《陈述》经钦本立审阅同意后，大量印发，并派专人送数百份到北京，向社会各界散发，在社会上掀起了一股声援《导报》的浪潮。
    《导报》极少数人从4月29日开始在编辑部办公室沿墙披上黑纱，在黑纱上张贴国内外各方面“声援”的函电。这实际上是一种示威，也是一种展览，以图动员社会各界前来参观和声援。钦本立亲自打电话动员海外报刊记者前往参观。他说：“你会感到新闻界开始觉醒了，独立了，团结了。”一时，到《导报》编辑部参观的人川流不息，欺骗了不少不明真相和受其影响的人，起到了鼓动动乱的社会作用。
    《导报》驻京办事处负责人张伟国更是活跃。他在北京新闻界和大学生中，在各种知识界集会上发表演说，介绍所谓《导报》事件真相，提醒新闻界“要对自己的主体意识彻底觉醒”。
  什么觉醒？张伟国接受香港《镜报》月刊记者采访时的谈话，作了最好的注解：“《导报》事件使得中国新闻界觉醒，这就是胜利。要推倒重来，中国大众传播媒介必定掀开历史的新一页”。5月4日，首都新闻界少数人打出了“新闻自由”、“声援《导报》”的旗帜走上街头。
    随着整个形势的发展，《导报》极少数人变本加厉，积极参加和支持动乱。5月13日，钦本立等人在锦江饭店开会，研究形势与策略。他们认为形势“十分有利”，是大“转换”的时刻到来了。用他们的话来说：“我们面临的形势，很可能是一个重要的转换时期，其深刻程度，后果如何很难估计，可能有我们尚未认识到的巨大意义。”于是他们干脆拒绝出报，而是集中全力，南北呼应，制造扩大上海的动乱。
    5月11日，《导报》极少数人纠集一些人，起草了《上海知识界呼吁书》，提出了五项要求，撤销对《导报》的处理，撤出派驻《导报》的整顿领导小组，恢复钦本立同志的职务，恢复发行被禁的4月24日《导报》有关版面，确保新闻自由，肯定和保护学生的爱国民主行动。《呼吁书》的内容很快见之于海外报纸。
    5月16日、18日，《导报》极少数人先后举行新闻发布会、中外记者招待会，并且特邀了美国等外国领事馆官员，以及近20所大学的学生非法组织成员参加，蓄意把《导报》事件扩大到国内外。他们发表声明说：“我们不把《导报》发生的事，仅仅看成是一个人、一张报纸的事。我们希望和同学们一起推进中国的民主建设，推进中国的政治改革。”
    《导报》极少数人一贯自我标榜“敢讲真话”，且看他们在动乱中为了把水搅混，又是如何“敢”造谣言的？5月18日，有人打电话问《导报》：“听说北京绝食学生死了3个，是否属实？”《导报》人员回答：“我们北京办事处核实过，是死了3个。”这个经过《导报》“核实”的谣言很快传出，更加激化了学生和市民的情绪，一时游行队伍中抬花圈、举挽联、戴黑纱……闹得乌烟瘴气。
    为了扩大动乱，《导报》极少数人还频繁出没于大学校园，串联，演讲，与非法组织上海“高自联”等建立起经常联系。为此，复旦大学非法学生组织头头还写信感谢“《导报》老师的宝贵指导”。《导报》极少数人购买大量面包、饮料慰问游行学生，给学生们打气。他们在群众游行队伍中发表演说，煽风点火。《导报》的四部电话（包括国际直拨电话）日夜24小时值班，接受北京和国内外信息，传递给上海一些大学和有关部门，又把上海信息传递出海内外。无怪乎当时学生中流传着一句话：“最新消息听《导报》，理论指导找《导报》。”
    彻底失败前的顽抗
    但是，《导报》极少数人和所有其他搞动乱的人一样，都错误估计了形势，低估了党和人民的力量，5月19日，李鹏同志代表党中央、国务院发表了义正辞严而又鼓舞人心的讲话。5月20日，国务院发出了对北京部分地区实行戒严的命令。钦本立等人意识到自己的末日来临而又不甘心失败，还要进行最后的猖狂一跳。
    在戒严令下达前，经济体制改革研究所、国务院农业研究中心发展研究所、中信公司国际问题研究所和北京青年经济学会抛出了关于当前形势的《六点意见》，公开暴露了党中央高层内部对学潮、动乱的意见分歧，并且用“人民日报号外”名义向社会散发，《导报》极少数人立即呼应，也编出“号外”，内容除《六点意见》外，还有曹思源的文章《让非暴力主义深入人心》，矛头直指党中央、国务院和人民解放军。只是由于印刷厂上级领导及时发现，采取措施，这份“号外”才未能出笼。
    5月21日，《导报》的极少数人在报社外面的“导报阅报栏”里，以“5·20天安门广场”为标题，贴出了30幅照片，宣扬动乱分子阻拦解放军进城、反对戒严，以及占据天安门广场，高举“打倒李鹏”反动标语等情况，一时观者如潮，道路为之堵塞。这一反动的舆论宣传，实际上为后来上海发生设置交通路障等严重动乱，进行了思想发动。
    北京曹思源、胡绩伟等人组织全国人大常委会委员签名，要求召开全国人大常委会紧急会议，妄图“罢免李鹏”。《导报》极少数人得悉后，立即闻风而动。5月21日下午，钦本立等人躲在一家宾馆密谋起草了“上海市中共党员致中共中央的公开信”。信中公开要求否定4月26日人民日报社论，反对国务院关于在北京部分地区实行戒严的命令，要求“收回”李鹏同志的“5·19”讲话，对党中央施加压力。他们四出拉党员签名，在遭到广大党员的抵制后，只得拉非党员充数，然后匆匆电传北京，捅到海外，制造“上海共产党员也行动起来”的假象。
    5月22日，《导报》极少数人又积极串联，组织所谓上海知识界声援北京，反对戒严的大游行，根据来自北京的“信息”，《导报》某些人书写了“打倒李杨反党集团”、“彻底粉碎李鹏反党反人民的政变阴谋”等反动横幅。他们在游行中，又公然打出“罢免李鹏”等横幅，高呼“打倒李鹏”等反动口号。钦本立以“白发苍苍、步履细慢”之态，参加了游行，成为这次游行最引人注目的镜头之一。
    《导报》极少数人还不惜与反动分子为伍，公然与臭名昭著的反动组织“中国民联”头目经常电话往来，保持密切联系。
    钦本立等人还乞灵于用海外反动舆论工具向党和政府施加压力。《导报》极少数人频繁接受海外新闻记者的采访，港台和西方的舆论工具连篇累牍发表有关《导报》的文章，为《导报》极少数人张目。据不完全统计，关于这方面的报道有300多篇，仅香港某报从4月25日到6月17日有关《导报》的新闻就达40篇以上。
    北京平息反革命暴乱以后，《导报》极少数人仍负隅顽抗。6月4日以后，港台及西方一些新闻机构造出什么“血洗天安门”、“黑色六月四日”之类的谣言。《导报》极少数人竟将这些反动材料复印、散发、张贴，他们还要《导报》工作人员佩黑纱，两次企图组织游行，均遭到《导报》群众抵制。一直到6月9日，《导报》仍约有20人参加上海“高自联”等非法组织在人民广场搞的“追悼会”，并拟在广场举行记者招待会。但是，上海人民在市委、市政府的领导下坚决制止动乱，这个记者招待会遂成为泡影。
    留下深刻的教训
    《导报》在这次动乱中的恶劣表演是偶然的吗？否。
    《导报》于1980年6月经中共上海市委宣传部批准创刊，由上海社会科学院主管。《导报》创刊以来，在宣传改革开放方面，曾发表过一些比较好的文章。但是，与此同时，在总编辑钦本立的错误思想指导下，《导报》也发表过许多错误文章，受到过中央与上海市委的多次批评。上海市委有关部门曾于1985年和1987年两次派员进行整顿。钦本立也曾多次检讨。但是，赵紫阳同志对《导报》总是予以支持和庇护。例如，1987年整顿《导报》的关键时刻，他的秘书到《导报》慰问，使整顿工作无法进行下去，因而，《导报》问题一直没有彻底解决。上海市委曾派一些同志加强《导报》领导力量，也先后被钦本立有恃无恐地排挤出去。特别近两年来，《导报》迎合国际大气候和国内小气候，越来越多地发表违反和反对四项基本原则的文章，沿着资产阶级自由化的道路迅速滑了下去。
    《导报》事件的性质是严重的，留下的教训是深刻的，有待于认真地全面地总结和反思。它告诉我们，与《导报》极少数坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人的斗争，决不是要不要新闻改革之争，而是坚持四项基本原则与坚持资产阶级自由化的尖锐斗争，是动乱与反动乱的政治斗争。它还告诉人们，在我们国家，任何舆论工具如果摆脱党的领导，背离社会主义方向，必然会滑到资产阶级自由化的泥坑中去。新闻改革，如果离开了坚持四项基本原则这个前提，必然是资产阶级自由化思潮的大泛滥。这是不以人的主观意志为转移的。
