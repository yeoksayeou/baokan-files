It is said that many ailments of the human body can be detected from the eyes. Similarly, from a journalist's perspective, or more specifically, from the attitude and objectivity of their reporting, one can somewhat gauge their professional ethics and work ethos.

China's reform and opening-up policy has achieved internationally recognized successes over the past decade. Two months after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, Chinese leaders have repeatedly solemnly reiterated that the reform and opening-up policy is correct and must be steadfastly pursued; China will not return to the old path of closing its doors. These points are clear to any foreigner without bias and with foresight, and thus have been increasingly understood and praised worldwide.

However, the Beijing correspondent for the American "Baltimore Sun," Mr. John Woodruff, recently claimed in a report that China is "day by day closing the 'open door' that has been open for 10 years" to the outside world. What is the basis for this claim? To find "concrete" evidence for his "judgment," this journalist struggled to find an "example": China "announced the suspension of the purchase of Japanese and European cars," and over the years, "these cars have become the hallmark of most Chinese taxis."

It seems he is using a single instance to draw a general conclusion.

However, with a little thought, one can easily discern the truth. In foreign trade, whether in developed countries or developing countries, large or small, countries decide what to import, how much to import, or not to import at all based on their production conditions and consumption needs. This is a normal practice and does not contradict a country's overall foreign economic and trade relations. Take the import of cars, for example. It is known that there are few foreign cars in India; Japanese cars hardly enter Italy; London's taxis are all British-made Austin cars. Can one conclude from this that these countries are closing their doors? According to this journalist's logic, when the U.S. government restricts the import of certain foreign products (such incidents frequently occur in the U.S.), can one conclude that the U.S. is closing its "open door" to the "outside world"?

Notably, this journalist is not satisfied with this alone and further "discovered" that the reason China is supposedly "closing its door to the world" is due to a "deep-rooted anti-foreign sentiment." From this frightening "discovery," he concludes that if such "anti-foreign sentiment" continues to escalate, it will make "many foreign businessmen, who are enthusiastic about working in China, lose heart." In short, according to this journalist's report, China is now "off-limits"!

However, things are strangely different. Just as this journalist is making these remarks, rational voices are resonating more loudly in many parts of the world: "The suppression of the riots is China's internal affair"; "China remains a market full of hope in the world"...

Contrary to Mr. Woodruff's claims, people increasingly see that it is not China that is "gradually closing its door to the world," but rather some people in the West who, taking advantage of China's suppression of the riots, are attempting to rudely interfere in China's internal affairs; they are trying to obstruct China's channels of external communication with various forms of "sanctions." It is precisely these people who want to close China's door to the outside world to exert pressure on China, and these plots are bound to fail.

Since the suppression of the riots and the restoration of normal order, people have seen that "many foreign businessmen interested in China" have returned to China, either to complete already signed agreements or to discuss new investment projects. Sino-Japanese trade in the first half of this year has increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year. The French newspaper "Le Monde" recently reported that French companies continue their projects in China, some are "negotiating new agreements," and "most senior managers of French companies have returned to China." Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote an article opposing the U.S. Congress's sanctions against China and pointed out that sanctions against China will eventually fail. The above points are undoubtedly wise attitudes and correct choices.

China's door remains open. Equality and mutual benefit are the principles that China has consistently adhered to in developing foreign economic and trade relations. Foreign friends, including all foreign businessmen who wish to develop economic and trade relations with China and invest in China, are guaranteed to obtain legal profits, which is beneficial to both parties. We hope that journalists stationed in Beijing will face the facts and report on China's open policy objectively and fairly, rather than "damaging the atmosphere of China's various connections with foreign countries."

### 中国绝不会“向世界关上大门”

    中国绝不会“向世界关上大门”
    立中
    据说，人体器官的不少毛病可以从人们的眼底检验出来。那么，从一个记者的“眼底”，即他看待事物的态度及其报道是否客观公正，还是主观武断甚或随心所欲进行歪曲，则多少可以检测出他的职业道德和从业心态如何。
    中国的改革开放政策10年来已取得举世公认的成就；两个月前平息北京反革命暴乱后，中国领导人又一再庄严重申：改革、开放政策是对的，要坚定不移地干下去；中国绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上。这一切，任何不怀偏见和稍有远见的外国人士是能看得清楚的，因而在世界上已得到日益广泛的理解和赞扬。
    可是，美国《巴尔的摩太阳报》驻北京记者约翰·伍德拉夫先生最近却在一则报道中声称：中国“正在日甚一日地向外部世界关上已有10年之久”的“开放的大门”。根据何在呢？为了给自己的“论断”寻找“确凿”的“论据”，这位记者先生好不容易才抓到一个“例证”：中国“宣布了停止购买日本和欧洲车的计划”，而这些年“这种车已经成为大多数中国出租汽车的标志”。
    看来，这是在抓取个别现象，做出普遍的结论。
    但是，人们只要稍一转念，就不难看出个中孰是孰非。在对外贸易中，世界上不论发达国家或发展中国家，不管是大国还是小国，无非根据本国的生产状况和消费需要，而决定在某一时期内进口什么、进口多少或不进口什么，这本是正常情理，与一个国家在总体上是否保持对外经贸关系毫不矛盾。就以进口汽车与否说吧，据悉，在印度很少看到外国汽车；日本的汽车简直难以进入意大利；伦敦的出租汽车清一色是英国奥斯汀牌。能够据此断言这些国家闭关锁国吗？按照这位记者先生的逻辑，当美国政府在某一时期限制进口某项外国产品（此类事情在美国经常发生），能否由此断言美国就是对“外部世界”关上“开放的大门”呢？！
    值得注意的是，这位记者先生并不以此为满足，竟进一步“发现”所谓中国重新“向世界关上大门”的原因在于“怀有根深蒂固的仇外态度”。从这一吓人的“发现”出发，他断言如这种“仇外鼓噪越闹越凶”，则会使“对在中国工作充满热情的许多外国商人心灰意冷”。总之，根据这位记者先生的报道，中国自此“去不得也！”
    但是，事情竟然如此奇怪，正当这位记者先生发表这些高论时，世界广大地区却传来了日益更加响亮的理智之声：“平息暴乱是中国内政”；“中国依然是世界上大有希望的市场”……
    同伍德拉夫先生的说法恰恰相反，人们日益清楚地看到，不是中国“正在逐步地向世界关上大门”，而是西方世界确有那么一些人，企图借中国平息暴乱之机，粗暴干涉中国内政；妄图以这种或那种“制裁”阻塞中国对外联系的渠道。恰恰是这些人，要以堵塞中国通向外部世界的大门向中国施加压力，这些图谋当然是不能得逞的。
    中国平息暴乱和恢复正常秩序以来，人们看到，“许多对中国感兴趣的外商”陆续回到中国，或继续完成已签订的协议，或洽谈新的投资项目。日中贸易今年上半年就比去年同期增长二成以上。法国《世界报》最近载文指出，法国企业继续进行在中国的工程，有的“正在谈判新的协定”，“法国的多数企业高级管理人员已重返中国”。美国前国务卿基辛格著文反对美国国会制裁中国，并指出对中国的制裁迟早要失败。上述种种，无疑是明智的态度和正确的抉择。
    中国的大门始终开放。平等互利是中国发展对外经贸关系一贯坚持的原则。外国朋友，包括一切愿意同中国发展经贸关系和到中国投资的外商在中国取得合法利润，是有充分保证的，而且对双方都是有利的。我们希望驻北京的记者能正视事实，对中国的开放政策进行客观公正的报道，而不要“破坏中国跟外国在各方面进行联系的气氛”。
