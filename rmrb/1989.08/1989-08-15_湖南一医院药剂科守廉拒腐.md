Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 15th.

The pharmacy department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Medical University is committed to maintaining integrity and resisting corruption. Over the past three years, they have refused to accept over ten million yuan in "commissions" and "rebates" offered by suppliers, instead turning all of it over to the public treasury.

At the beginning of last year, a representative from a pharmaceutical company in another province approached the department's director, Xu Shuwu, with an offer to hire him as a consultant for the company. The representative promised a monthly salary of 300 yuan, with the intention of using Xu Shuwu to establish drug supply relationships with various hospitals in Hunan. Xu Shuwu, upon understanding the representative's true intentions, declined the offer and refused the salary.

    湖南一医院药剂科守廉拒腐
    据新华社长沙八月十五日电　湖南医科大学第二附属医院药剂科矢志守廉，拒腐不贪。三年来，供货单位给的十多万元“好处费”、“回扣费”，他们一分也没私分，全部上缴归公。
    去年初，外省一家医药公司的推销员找到这个科的主任许树梧，要聘请他当公司的顾问，并许诺每月酬金三百元，其意是想通过许树梧与湖南各地医院建立药品购销关系。许树梧弄清对方来意后，一不接聘书，二不要酬金。
