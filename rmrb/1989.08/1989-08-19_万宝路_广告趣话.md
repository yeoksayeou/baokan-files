The article "The 'Brand Image Law' of Advertising" published on the seventh page of the People's Daily on July 29 is a good short piece introducing the concept of brand image. The only flaw is that it mistakenly attributes the Marlboro cigarette advertisement to David Ogilvy. In fact, the Marlboro cigarette advertisement has been handled by the "Leo Burnett Company" since 1954.

Marlboro cigarettes are one of the several brands marketed by the American Philip Morris Company. Before 1954, this brand was considered a women's cigarette, and its market share in the United States was only one percent. To boost sales, the company decided to find a capable advertising agency to transform Marlboro into a cigarette preferred by men. After thorough investigation and comparison, they chose the Leo Burnett Company.

In the summer of 1954, Leo Burnett (the founder of the company) gathered his best creative team for a meeting to discuss this issue. Burnett recalled a black-and-white photograph of a cowboy on the cover of Life magazine that had left a deep impression on him. He decided to choose the cowboy image from among various options for the Marlboro test advertisement. The advertisement was well-received in the test market. However, using images of policemen, deep-sea fishermen, and truck drivers did not yield good results. Thus, the cowboy image was ultimately chosen as the face of Marlboro and has been used ever since. In 1962, Leo Burnett further decided to use western ranch landscapes as the background for the advertisements, with the slogans "Come to the Fragrant Land" and "Come to Marlboro Country" as the basic creative ideas for the Marlboro advertisements.

After taking over the Marlboro cigarette advertisements, Leo Burnett never used professional models for the Marlboro image. The first model was a media salesperson, and later, he hired deep-sea divers, mechanics, and others for the advertisements. This tradition of not using professional models continues to this day.

The Leo Burnett Company has been advertising Marlboro cigarettes for thirty-five years now. Marlboro cigarettes have become the top-selling brand in the global market. In 1987, Marlboro sold 134 billion cigarettes worldwide. The Philip Morris Company made a fortune and acquired famous American companies like General Foods, becoming one of the world's renowned multinational corporations.

In this development process, Leo Burnett's cowboy image played a significant role. Even non-smokers are somewhat familiar with the Marlboro cowboy. In the 1960 selection of the top ten advertisements of the 1950s in the United States, two advertisements from the Leo Burnett Company were chosen, one of which was the Marlboro cigarette advertisement. In 1977, the Wall Street Journal mentioned in an article that "Leo Burnett's Marlboro cigarette advertising strategy is considered a classic in advertising." The American advertising giant David Ogilvy, in his book "Ogilvy on Advertising," praised Leo Burnett as one of the six greatest advertisers in his mind, stating, "Undoubtedly, Leo Burnett's immortal masterpiece is Marlboro cigarettes, which transformed an obscure brand name into the world's best-selling cigarette."

    “万宝路”广告趣话
    林桦
    七月二十九日《人民日报》第七版上发表的《广告的“品牌形象法”》是一篇介绍品牌形象的好短文。美中不足之处是该文错把“万宝路”香烟广告说成是戴维·奥格威所做。其实“万宝路”香烟广告从一九五四年以来一直为“李奥贝纳广告公司”所包揽。
    “万宝路”香烟是美国菲利浦·莫里斯公司上市的几种香烟之一。一九五四年以前这种香烟被视为女性吸用的香烟，它在美国的销售量只占市场份额的百分之一。为了打开销路，公司决定找寻得力的广告代理，把“万宝路”改为男性喜爱的香烟。在经过反复的调查比较后，他们选定了李奥贝纳公司。
    一九五四年夏的一个周末，李奥贝纳（公司的创办人）召集了他最好的创作人员开会研究这个问题。李奥贝纳回忆起他在《生活》杂志一期封面上看到的一张黑白西部牛仔照片给他留下的深刻印象，决定在诸多方案中选西部牛仔作为“万宝路”测试广告的形象。广告推出后，在测试市场上得到了很好的反应。而以警察、潜水渔夫、卡车司机的形象来测试，效果都不甚佳。于是西部牛仔最终确定为“万宝路”人。这个形象一直使用至今天。一九六二年，李奥贝纳进一步确定以西部农场风景为广告摄影的背景，以“请到芬芳之乡来”、“请到万宝路之乡来”的广告语为“万宝路”广告策划的基本创意。
    李奥贝纳接手“万宝路”香烟广告后从不使用专业模特儿为“万宝路”的广告形象，第一个原形是一位媒体版面推销员，之后，他曾雇用过深水潜水员、机械工人等等做广告形象。这个不使用专业模特儿的传统也一直保持至今。
    李奥贝纳公司为“万宝路”香烟做广告现在已经三十五个年头了。“万宝路”香烟在世界市场上今天已经占了首位。一九八七年全世界销售的“万宝路”为一千三百四十亿支。菲利浦·莫里斯公司大发其财，他们买下了美国著名的通用食品公司等，今天它已经是世界上有名的大型跨国公司了。
    在这个发展过程中，李奥贝纳的西部牛仔帮了大忙。“万宝路”的西部牛仔即使不吸烟的人也是略知一二。一九六零年在美国推选五十年代广告十佳的评比中，李奥贝纳公司的两则广告中选，其中之一便是“万宝路”香烟广告。一九七七年《华尔街日报》在一篇文章中说“李奥贝纳的‘万宝路’香烟广告策划被认为是广告经典之作。”美国广告巨子戴维·奥格威在《奥格威谈广告》一书中把李奥贝纳推崇为他心目中的六大广告人之一，说“毫无疑问，李奥贝纳的不朽纪念作品就是马博罗（即万宝路）香烟，他把一个籍籍无名的品名变成世界最畅销的香烟。”
