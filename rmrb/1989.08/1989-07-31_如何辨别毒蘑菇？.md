Recently, in areas such as Gaoheshi Township in Jinxiang County, Shandong Province, there has been continuous rain and high temperatures. Large quantities of poisonous mushrooms have sprouted in decayed wood and dead leaves. Local farmers have indiscriminately picked and eaten these mushrooms, resulting in mass poisoning. Among the victims, 12 people have died despite rescue efforts.

To prevent similar incidents from happening again, please introduce some knowledge on how to identify whether mushrooms are poisonous.

There are approximately 400 species of wild mushrooms in China, of which about 300 are edible, and nearly 100 are poisonous. They often grow together, and some have very similar appearances, making them difficult to distinguish. Currently, there is no simple method to identify all poisonous mushrooms. Based on what I know, I will introduce a few identification methods for reference.

	Morphological Identification Method

Identifying mushrooms based on their appearance requires some knowledge of fungi. Many species of poisonous mushrooms in the umbrella family have external veil remnants on the cap surface during development, forming conical, warty, or blocky scales. Some have smooth surfaces or spotted patterns. As the poisonous mushrooms age, the scales gradually fall off or increase. Although edible mushrooms and poisonous mushrooms have many similar morphological characteristics, careful observation and repeated comparison can reveal differences, allowing for correct identification. For example, the edible pointed milk cap and the poisonous red-brown milk cap both grow on the ground in broadleaf or coniferous forests during the summer and autumn. They have similar morphological characteristics, but upon close inspection, it can be found that the edible pointed milk cap has a flat, ring-shaped cap that flattens and becomes concave in the middle, with a small nipple in the center, and is light brown or dark red in color, not sticky, and has no ring. The poisonous red-brown milk cap, on the other hand, is larger in size, with a color ranging from light red-brown to rusty brown, and has a spicy taste. To master classification knowledge, one should learn from professional technical personnel and those with practical experience. For suspicious mushrooms, one should never pick and eat them oneself, as this could lead to disastrous consequences.

	Several Traditional Identification Methods

These methods are summarized from years of practical experience by the masses and are widely used. Poisonous mushrooms are often characterized by bright colors and attractive appearances; they do not attract insects or maggots; their tissues change color when injured; they have spicy, bitter, or numbing tastes and smells; and they turn silverware, garlic, or rice black when cooked. These methods may be effective for certain types of poisonous mushrooms but not for others and cannot be used as the sole method for identifying all poisonous mushrooms. For example, the edible red-pored bolete turns red when its tissue is injured, while the blue-staining bolete turns blue.

	Concentrated Hydrochloric Acid Identification Method

This is a new method. The specific procedure is as follows: Squeeze a drop of juice from the fresh mushroom and drop it onto a piece of paper. After it dries, drop a drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid (containing more than 50%) onto the mushroom juice spot on the paper. If it turns blue within 1-20 minutes, it is a poisonous mushroom; if it does not change color, it is non-poisonous. The basic principle is that the toxins in poisonous mushrooms are amino acid cyclopeptides, which, when mixed with the lignin in the paper and added to concentrated hydrochloric acid, turn blue. The more toxic the mushroom, the faster and deeper the blue color appears. This method can cause most poisonous mushrooms to change color, but not all. Therefore, this method should be combined with observations of external characteristics and repeated comparisons. If there is any doubt, one should never eat the mushrooms indiscriminately.

It is also important to remind everyone that drinking alcohol while eating poisonous mushrooms can accelerate and intensify the onset of poisoning. Mushrooms that are slightly poisonous may not cause a reaction when eaten alone, but when consumed with alcohol, they can cause poisoning. For example, the ink cap mushroom is edible and tasty when young, but some people experience restlessness, dilated blood vessels, rapid heartbeat, tinnitus, fainting, chills, and sometimes intestinal inflammation-type poisoning symptoms when consumed with alcohol. Sometimes, eating a small amount of poisonous mushrooms can be treated, but if alcohol is consumed, it can be fatal, leaving a lifelong regret.

    如何辨别毒蘑菇？
    问：前一段，山东省金乡县高河乡等地区阴雨连绵，气温较高，在一些朽木和枯枝败叶丛中，滋生出大量有毒蘑菇，当地农民盲目采集食用，造成大量人员中毒，其中已有12人因抢救无效而丧生。
    为使类似事件不再发生，请介绍一下如何辨别蘑菇有无毒素的知识。
            山东金乡县广播电视局　刘建新
    答：我国野生蘑菇约有400种，其中可吃的有300余种，毒蘑菇有近100种，它们混杂在一起生长，有的形态特征很相似，很难区分。要想使用一种最简便的方法鉴别所有毒菇，目前尚有困难。现据我所了解的，介绍几种辨认方法，供参考。
                形态特征辨认法
    根据蘑菇长相来鉴别，这就要学习点菌类知识。伞类毒菇的不少种类，在发育过程中外菌幕残留在菇盖表面而形成角锥状、疣状或块状鳞片，有些表面光滑或花斑花纹等，随着毒菇的老化，鳞片逐渐老脱落或增多。可食菇和毒菇虽有很多种形态特征很相似，只要细心观察，反复比较，就能发现区别，正确辨别。再如，可食的尖顶乳菇和有毒的红褐乳菇，都在夏秋季节生长在阔叶或针叶林中地上，形态特征很相似，细细观察就会发现可食的尖顶乳菇菇盖扁平环形，平展后中下凹，中部有小乳突，淡褐红色或暗红色，不粘，无环带，而有毒的红褐菇个体大，色泽为淡红褐色或铁锈色，味道很辛辣。要掌握分类知识，要向专业科技人员学习，向有实践经验的人学习，对可疑的菇类，千万不可自采自食，造成恶果。
            几种传统的辨别方法
    这是多年群众实践总结出来的，四处传用。毒菇如颜色鲜艳，长相好看；不生虫不长蛆；组织受伤后变色；有辛、苦、麻、嗅味；炒煮时使银器、大蒜、米饭变黑等等，这些方法可能对某一种毒菇有效，对其它的无效，不能作为对所有毒菇统一鉴别的唯一方法。如可食的红肉菇，组织受伤后变红色；粉盖牛肝菌组织受伤后变蓝色等。
          浓度盐酸鉴别法
    这是一种新方法，具体做法是：将采的鲜菇挤一滴液汁滴到报纸上，待干后再将一滴浓度盐酸（含50％以上）滴在报纸菇汁点上，在1—20分钟内呈蓝色即为毒菇，不变色为无毒。其基本原理是毒菇的毒素是一些氨基酸环肽，它与报纸上的木质素混合后加上浓度盐酸即呈蓝色，毒性越大，出现蓝色越快越深，这种方法可以使大多数毒变色，但不是所有。因此，此法还应结合外形特征观察，反复比较，有可疑点千万不可盲目食用。
    还需提醒大家注意，在食用毒菇时饮酒，会加快加重毒性发作。微毒的菇本来吃了没有反应，但与酒同食，就会引起中毒。如墨汁鬼伞，幼时可食味道好，但有的人在酒菌同食后，引起精神不安，心血管扩张，心跳加快，耳鸣，虚脱，发冷，有时还会出现肠胃炎型等中毒症状。有时吃了少量毒菇，本来可以抢救，但因喝了酒，就无法救治，造成终生遗憾。北京市科学技术协会　张凤华
