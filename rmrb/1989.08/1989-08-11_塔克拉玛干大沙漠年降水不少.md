Chinese meteorological researchers have provided data after conducting a year-long on-site observation in the heart of the Taklamakan Desert. The data shows that the annual rainfall in 1988 reached over 80 millimeters, which is about 30 millimeters more than the oases at the southern edge of the desert. This amount is roughly equivalent to double the annual rainfall in the Sahara Desert in Africa. Previous records often described this area as a "rainless zone," suggesting that even if rain clouds passed over, the rain would evaporate in mid-air due to the intense heat. The on-site investigation has corrected this traditional view.

    塔克拉玛干大沙漠年降水不少
    据新华社乌鲁木齐八月十一日电（记者申尊敬）我国气象科研人员在塔克拉玛干大沙漠中心地带实地观测一年后提供的数据表明，这里一九八八年降水量达八十多毫米，比沙漠南缘绿洲还多三十毫米左右，相当于非洲撒哈拉大沙漠年降水量的一倍。过去的许多资料说这里是“无雨区”，即使偶尔有雨云飘过，雨点落到半空就被太阳蒸发走了。实地考察的资料矫正了这一传统说法。
