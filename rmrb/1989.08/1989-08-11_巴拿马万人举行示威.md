Ten thousand people in Panama's capital held a demonstration against the government on August 10, braving heavy rain. The protest was held on the first anniversary of the death of Arnulfo Arias, former chairman of the Authentic Panamanian Party, who had served as Panama's president three times. The demonstrators, despite the pouring rain, chanted slogans such as "Down with Noriega," "Down with the current government led by Solís," and "Demand a referendum," as they slowly made their way to Arias' grave. No violent incidents occurred during the march.

    巴拿马万人举行示威
    巴拿马首都1万群众10日冒雨举行了反政府示威活动。这次示威是在曾3次担任巴拿马总统的真正巴拿马主义党前主席阿努尔福·阿里亚斯逝世1周年之际举行的。游行群众冒着倾盆大雨，一边高呼“打倒诺列加”，“打倒以索利斯为首的现政府”和“要求举行公民投票”的口号，一边向阿里亚斯的墓地缓缓行进。游行过程中未发生暴力事件。
