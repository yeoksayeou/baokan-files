According to national industrial policies, while determining the focus and policy measures for adjusting the industrial structure, the Economic Commission, Planning Commission, Finance, Taxation, Banking, and Materials departments, among 11 other administrative departments in Jining, Shandong, recently signed "double guarantee" agreements with 20 key enterprises. This is to ensure the realization of the "double increase and double savings" goals.

These 20 enterprises account for 40% of the total industrial output value of local enterprises in the city and 65% of the profits, and are known as the "pillar enterprises for benefits" and "new stars for profits." They were selected from enterprises that are crucial for adjusting the industrial and product structures.

Prior to this, the city, based on national industrial policies, screened 427 county-level and above industrial enterprises, 489 products, and 338 technical transformation and development projects. From these, 69 enterprises, 111 products, and 71 technical transformation and development projects that are urgently needed in the market, have good benefits, and ensure fiscal revenue were selected as key focus areas. These areas received preferential policies in terms of production factors.

The main content of the "double guarantee" agreement is as follows: enterprises guarantee the full completion of this year's targets for increased production and savings, increased revenue and reduced expenditures, including indicators such as output value, output quantity, sales revenue, realized profits, fund tax rate, accelerated turnover of fixed working capital, and labor productivity. Government administrative departments guarantee the external conditions needed for enterprise production, including electricity, funds, coal, steel, chemical raw materials, and transportation, ensuring supply.

The "double guarantee" agreement also stipulates that if an enterprise fails to complete the progress plan for three consecutive quarters, it will no longer enjoy the various preferential policies in the agreement. If government administrative departments fail to meet their responsibilities due to insufficient effort, they should bear the corresponding responsibilities.

After the signing and implementation of the agreement, the declining production situation in key enterprises was reversed, and economic and social benefits significantly improved.

    调整工业结构　确保“双增双节”
    济宁市主管部门同企业签订“双保”协议
    本报讯　记者鲁牧报道：依照国家产业政策导向，在确定调整工业结构的重点及其政策措施的同时，山东济宁市经委、计委、财政、税务、银行、物资等11个主管部门最近与20个重点企业签订“双保”协议，以确保“双增双节”目标实现。
    这20个企业产值占全市地方工业企业的40％，效益占65％，并被称之为“效益支柱企业”、创利“新秀企业”。它们是从调整工业结构、产品结构确定必保的企业中选拔出来的。
    在这之前，该市以国家产业政策为依据，对全市427个县属以上工业企业、489个产品、338个技改和开发项目进行了一次筛选，从中选出了市场急需、效益较好、财政收入有保证的69家企业、111个产品和71个技改、开发项目作为必保的重点，在生产要素上实行倾斜政策。
    “双保”协议的主要内容是：企业保今年增产节约、增收节支奋斗目标的全面完成，其中包括产值、产量、销售收入、实现利润、资金利税率、定额流动资金周转加速率、劳动生产率等指标；政府主管部门保企业生产所需的外部条件，其中包括电力、资金、煤炭、钢材、化工原料、交通运输等，在供应上予以保证。
      “双保”协议还规定，企业“双增双节”目标如果连续3个季度累计完不成进度计划的，不再享受协议中的各种优惠政策；政府主管部门如因主观努力不够，影响企业“双增双节”任务的完成，应承担相应的责任。
    协议签订、履行后，扭转了重点企业生产
  “滑坡”局面，经济、社会效益明显回升。
