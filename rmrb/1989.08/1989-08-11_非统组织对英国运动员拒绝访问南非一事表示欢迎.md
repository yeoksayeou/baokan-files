Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, August 9th.

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) today issued a news release welcoming the decision of two black athletes to withdraw from a British cricket team scheduled to visit South Africa.

The 16-member cricket team was set to visit South Africa in January 1990 and 1991.

The OAU expressed hope that other team members would also withdraw from the team, standing against the "barbaric apartheid system."

Additionally, the OAU highly praised the contributions made by the international anti-apartheid movement. This movement is dedicated to expelling South Africa from the realms of sports and other fields.

    非统组织对英国运动员拒绝访问南非一事表示欢迎
    新华社亚的斯亚贝巴8月9日电　非统组织今天发布新闻公报，对两名黑人选手退出准备访问南非的英国板球队一事表示欢迎。
    这支由16人组成的板球队准备分别于明年1月和1991年访问南非。
    非统组织在公报中希望其他球员也以反对“野蛮的种族隔离制度”为重，退出这支板球队。
    另外，非统组织对国际反种族隔离运动所做出的贡献给予高度评价。这个运动正致力于把南非从体育和其他领域中驱逐出去。
