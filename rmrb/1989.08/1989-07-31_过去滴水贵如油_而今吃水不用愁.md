In the past, water was as precious as oil in the villages of Jibao, Niying, and five other villages in the mountainous region of Lanshan Township, Suining County, Northern Jiangsu. Although there were a few wells, the water table was shallow, and the water quality was poor. During the severe drought last summer, these seven villages faced even more severe water shortages. Locals had to use ropes to lower buckets into the wells to draw muddy water, which they then had to clarify before drinking. Some even had to travel over ten miles to neighboring areas in Anhui Province to fetch water.

In July of last year, leaders from the Xuzhou Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, including He Fushuo and Li Yangzhen, and leaders from the Municipal People's Congress, including Zhuang Minqian, visited the township to inspect the disaster situation. They were deeply moved and immediately decided to address the drinking water issues for the seven villages in Lanshan Township. The provincial and municipal governments quickly allocated 100,000 yuan, and the county government also squeezed out some funds. Together with the villagers' own contributions, construction began in December last year. By the end of May this year, three 80-meter-deep rock wells had been drilled in Niying, Jibao, and Tushan villages, and the old wells in the other four villages had been flushed, equipped, and installed with water supply systems. The once water-scarce mountainous region now has 25 water supply points, and the villagers no longer have to worry about drinking water.

On the day the water supply was completed, the officials and villagers gathered to drink water and express their gratitude, erecting a monument to commemorate the party and government's practical efforts for the people.

    过去滴水贵如油  而今吃水不用愁
    苏北睢宁县岚山乡鸡宝、倪营等7个村地处山区高亢地带，虽有几眼土井，但水位浅，水质差。去年夏季酷旱，这7个村缺水更为严重，群众需系绳坠入井底，一点一点舀泥水澄清后饮用，有的群众甚至跑十几里地到毗邻的安徽省境内运水。
    去年7月，徐州市政协的何赋硕、李仰珍，市人大的庄敏虔等领导同志到这个乡察看灾情，心情十分沉重，当即商定解决岚山乡7个村群众饮水难的问题。省、市很快拨款10万元，县财政也挤出部分资金，加上群众自筹部分，于去年12月动工，到今年5月底，就为倪营、鸡宝、土山3个村打了80米深的岩石井3眼，并对另4个村的旧井进行了冲洗、配套和供水工程安装。过去滴水贵如油的山乡，而今有25个供水点，群众吃水不用愁了。
    供水之日，干群饮水思源，树碑立传，称赞党和政府为群众办实事的作风。
