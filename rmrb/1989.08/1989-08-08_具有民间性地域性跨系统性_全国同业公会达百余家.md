    Associations with Folk, Regional, and Cross-System Characteristics: Over 100 Industry Associations Across the Nation

    According to a report from the national industry association work experience exchange meeting held today, industry associations, which played an active role in socialist construction and socialist transformation in the early days of the founding of the nation, are now showing vigorous vitality.

    Currently, 18 provinces and cities across the nation have established over 100 industry associations. With their unique folk, regional, and cross-system characteristics, they are playing an active role in economic construction.

    Industry associations are voluntary economic organizations formed by enterprises in the same or related industries. During the exploratory trial period, various levels of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have played an important role. In March and April of this year, a survey team composed of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce conducted surveys on the industry associations established by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in 7 cities in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. The survey results show that they have shown significant effects in bridging the gap between enterprises and government departments, participating in industry management, coordinating industry relations, leveraging overall advantages, assisting in price stabilization, expanding exports, conducting business training, and promoting enterprise reforms.

    具有民间性地域性跨系统性
    全国同业公会达百余家
    本报北京8月8日讯　记者袁建达从今天召开的全国同业公会工作经验交流会上获悉：建国初期曾在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中发挥过积极作用的同业公会，正焕发出蓬勃的朝气。
    目前，全国已有18个省市建立100余家同业公会。他们以自己特有的民间性、地域性和跨系统性，在经济建设中起着积极作用。
    同业公会是以同一行业或相近企业自愿组织起来的民间性经济组织。在探索试办过程中，全国工商联各级组织发挥了重要作用。今年三四月间，由中共中央统战部、国家体改委和全国工商联等部门联合组成的调查组，分别对浙江、广东、广西、四川、陕西5省区7市工商联试办的同业公会作了调查。调查结果表明，它们在沟通企业和政府部门的联系、参与行业管理、协调同业关系、发挥整体优势、协助平抑物价、扩大出口、开展业务培训和推进企业改革等方面，已经显示出明显的作用。
