At a meeting of the Ministry of Railways, with only 20 minutes left for speeches, Cao Zhongmin stood up abruptly and discussed four issues: how to maintain the leading position of railways in the national economy; how to establish a large transportation system with railways as the core; how to measure the investment effect of railway construction; and how to quickly form transportation capacity. His voice was powerful, but the time was abruptly cut off after 15 minutes. The hall was silent, then suddenly erupted in applause. Experts and professors whispered to each other: "Wow, who would have thought. The Engineering Bureau has such talent, hidden dragons and crouching tigers."

In early 1984, after the unit was reorganized from the military system into a railway construction enterprise, it implemented independent accounting, autonomous operation, and self-responsibility for profits and losses.

At nearly 50 years old and serving as the chief accountant, Cao Zhongmin focused his attention on funds. At that time, the enterprise had a problem: many people only worked without accounting, and after completing a project, they did not know whether it was profitable or not. If this continued, the enterprise would surely collapse. He thought: it should start from strict management, scientific construction, and ideological education, and promote an economic responsibility system with technical progress and contracting as the core. To this end, he traveled over 2,000 kilometers, visiting all the work sites in the entire bureau, and lecturing in each place he visited. The South-Dongpu Line's Dashihu River Bridge, originally took half a year to complete with a loss of 23,000 yuan. After implementing internal contracting, the internal economic relations were straightened out, and the construction unit began to weigh the use of machinery, vehicles, and the purchase of sand and gravel. Three months later, the loss was turned into a profit of 32,000 yuan.

Strengthening internal accounting and improving the business level of financial personnel is very important. He compiled the book "Railway Construction Accounting" and organized six financial training classes. The Daqin Railway's Xihanling Bridge Group, with its large scale and complex construction, he proposed the implementation of a target cost management responsibility system, providing new experience in controlling costs for large-scale construction sites. He also successfully promoted the "profit contracting," "non-production unit expense quota contracting," and "bureau and department economic and technical index guarantee responsibility system," strengthening management and plugging loopholes for waste. The entire bureau's profit index rose rapidly, and among the more than 40 construction enterprises in Shanxi Province, the 17th Bureau ranked first in comprehensive economic benefits. In the evaluation by the Ministry of Railways, the 17th Bureau again won the title of outstanding economic benefits unit. Cao Zhongmin was praised as the "money grabber" and "financial expert," and was promoted to senior accountant.

After the bureau implemented the "100-yuan output value wage content contracting," the progress of engineering once improved, but the problem of neglecting quality resurfaced, making it difficult to prevent. Bureau Director Chen Kong'an asked Cao Zhongmin to come up with a solution first.

Talking on paper is not enough. Cao Zhongmin hurried to the grassroots level, conducted investigations and research, and then led a group of bureau staff to Datong. Together with planning, statistics, safety, quality, and financial personnel from the grassroots level, they held a discussion meeting. Through collective wisdom, they formed a method of "100-yuan output value wage content contracting" with "quality and remuneration" as the core. This method, like a magical elixir, has kept the quality rate of engineering projects in the entire bureau above 90% for several years. 33 projects were rated as excellent by Shanxi Province and the Ministry of Railways, with one project winning the national quality engineering award.

    入“迷”方得真昧
    ——记铁道部十七局总会计师曹中敏
    贾培模　唐世春
    铁道部召开的全路领导干部研讨会上，发言仅剩最后20分钟，曹中敏霍地站起，讲了四个问题：如何保持铁路在国民经济中的先行地位；如何建立以铁路为交通网络的大交通系统；如何衡量铁路建设投资效果；如何尽快形成运输能力。他声音宏亮，15分钟便嘎然截止。会场鸦雀无声，突然又一片哗然、掌声。专家、教授交头接耳：“嗬，真想不到。工程局有这等人才，藏龙卧虎呵。”
    1984年初，单位由军队系统改编为铁路基建企业后，实行独立核算，自主经营，自负盈亏。
    年近50、身为总会计师的曹中敏把注意力集中在资金上。当时企业存在的弊端是，不少人光干不算，干完一项工程，是盈是亏不知道。如此下去，企业非垮台不可。他想：应该从严格管理、科学施工、思想教育入手，推行以技术进步和承发包为核心的经济责任制。为此，他行程2000多公里，跑遍了全局所有工点，走一地讲一地。南同蒲复线大石河大桥，原来干了半年亏损23000元。推行内部承包以后，理顺了内部经济关系，施工单位用机械设备、车辆、购买沙石料都掂分量了，三个月后扭亏为盈，盈利32000元。
    加强内部核算，提高财会人员业务水平很关键，他主编了《铁路基本建设会计》一书，举办了6期财会培训班。大秦铁路西韩岭桥群，规模宏大，施工复杂，他提出推行目标成本管理责任制，提供了大规模工地施工控制成本的新经验。他还卓有建树地推出了“利润定包”、“非生产性单位经费定额包干”、“局处机关经济技术指标包保责任制”等，强化了经营管理，堵塞了浪费漏洞，全局创利指数上升很快，山西省40多家建筑企业经济效益综合评比，17局名列第一。铁道部评比，17局又夺经济效益显著单位桂冠。曹中敏也被赞为“抓钱耙子”、“理财能手”，破格晋升为高级会计师。
    局推行“百元产值工资含量包干”后，一度工程进度上去了，但忽视质量的通病复发，防不胜防，令人抓耳挠腮。局长陈孔安叫曹中敏先拿出意见来。
    纸上谈兵不行。曹中敏马不停蹄到基层，调查研究，又率领局机关一众人马到大同，与来自基层的计划、统计、安全质量、财会人员，开起了讨论会。集思广益，形成了以优质优酬为核心的百元产值工资含量包干办法。以优质优酬为核心的百元产值工资含量包干办法，如一剂灵药，全局几年来，工程质量优良率一直稳定在90％以上。33个项目被山西省、铁道部评为全优工程，其中一项获国家优质工程奖。
