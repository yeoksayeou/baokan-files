Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is currently visiting here, said today that during his participation in the International Conference on the Cambodian Problem in Paris, he met with some Western foreign ministers at their request. He criticized the recent incorrect attitudes these countries have taken towards China.

Qian Qichen made these remarks during a meeting with Zimbabwean Speaker of Parliament Mutasa.

Qian Qichen said that these Western foreign ministers told him that they all wanted to continue developing relations with China.

Mutasa said he opposed including China's domestic issues as a supplementary agenda item for the 82nd Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference to be held in September. He said the conference had no right to discuss the internal affairs of a country.

Mutasa expressed Zimbabwe's parliament's willingness to further strengthen friendly cooperative relations with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China. He reiterated that Zimbabwe's parliament invited a delegation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China to visit Zimbabwe.

Mutasa said that since Zimbabwe's independence, it has pursued a policy of racial reconciliation and has successfully resolved domestic racial conflicts, providing an example for South Africa. He hoped that China would play a further role in the issues of Southern Africa.

    钱外长同穆塔萨议长会谈
    本报哈拉雷8月4日电　本报记者李景卫、新华社记者张敬雷报道：正在这里访问的中国外交部长钱其琛今天说，他在巴黎参加柬埔寨问题国际会议时应一些西方国家外长的要求，同他们举行了会见。他批评了这些国家最近对中国所采取的不正确态度。
    钱其琛是在同津巴布韦议长穆塔萨举行会谈时说这番话的。
    钱其琛说，这些西方国家的外长告诉他，他们都愿意继续同中国发展关系。
    穆塔萨说，他反对把中国国内问题列为9月间召开的第82届各国议会联盟会议的补充议题。他说，会议无权讨论一个国家的内部事务。
    穆塔萨表示津巴布韦议会愿进一步同中国人大常委会加强友好合作关系。他重申，津巴布韦议会邀请中国人大常委会派代表团访问津巴布韦。
    穆塔萨说，津巴布韦独立后奉行种族和解政策，很好地解决了国内种族矛盾问题，这为南非提供了一个范例。他希望中国在南部非洲问题上进一步发挥作用。
