In March of this year, the State Council issued a decision on the key points of the current industrial policy. Over the past four months, many regions and departments have seriously organized study and understood the spirit of the decision, and have promptly formulated implementation measures. Provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Liaoning have also adjusted their industrial and product structures according to the national industrial policy guidelines, achieving some results.

The country has formally proposed a relatively systematic and clear industrial policy for the first time in 40 years since its founding. This is not only of great significance for strengthening and improving macroeconomic management and establishing and perfecting the macro-control system, but also provides a basis for rectification and adjustment of the economic structure. It gives the correct direction for the development of production and construction in various regions, departments, and enterprises, thus having a significant impact on the sustained and stable development of the national economy.

In the past, we did not fully recognize the importance and significance of industrial policy. Some comrades even lacked the concept of industrial policy. We talk about developing productive forces, don't we? The rational allocation and configuration of national resources are fundamental issues that must be addressed in the development of productive forces, and this is precisely the content of industrial policy. An incorrect or unclear industrial policy will inevitably lead to structural imbalances, and the waste of productive forces caused by structural imbalances can be said to be the greatest waste. Think about it, due to insufficient energy, many factories are operating intermittently, how much waste is there? At this time, if we invest in long-term projects, it is more of a waste than construction. The low economic efficiency of our enterprises is closely related to the irrational industrial structure.

Industrial policy is a fundamental policy that affects and determines the allocation of resources, the layout of productive forces, economic benefits, and economic potential in our country. Even without mentioning construction, the formulation of reform and opening-up measures and steps must also consider this policy and promote its implementation. Some people say that industrial policy is the intersection of reform and development, which is reasonable.

Currently, in the development of our national economy, the contradiction between supply and demand has not been alleviated, and structural contradictions are becoming more pronounced. Rectification and adjustment not only need to reduce the scale in terms of total demand but also gradually solve the problem of irrational structures. By adjusting according to the requirements of the national industrial policy, what needs to be reduced will be reduced, and what needs to be increased will be increased. In this way, we can achieve the effect of killing two birds with one stone, balancing the total amount and making the structure more rational. Therefore, how well the industrial policy is implemented will determine whether our rectification and adjustment achieve fundamental results.

Implementing the national industrial policy is not easy. For example, in industries such as metallurgy, the main focus is to restrict the "several smalls," but these "several smalls" mostly belong to township enterprises, which will inevitably conflict with local interests. Moreover, since the reform, local powers have expanded, and each place has a certain degree of control over land, funds, electricity, transportation, materials, and foreign exchange, making it easy to act on local interests and do whatever they want. Therefore, while raising awareness of the importance of industrial policy, it is necessary to do a good job of specific coordination and organizational work.

Maintaining the integrity of the national industrial policy is crucial. The current industrial policy not only starts from the overall interests of the country and implements the requirements of rectification and adjustment but also, in order to adapt to the different situations of various regions, considers the interests of local areas. The national macro-control departments should formulate necessary and effective biased measures according to the industrial policy to provide clear and effective guidance; each region should determine the industries and products that need to be restricted or stopped from developing, or the industries and products that need to be encouraged and supported for development according to the requirements of the industrial policy and the local situation. The implementation of the national industrial policy, as well as its specific and regional implementation, and the formulation of measures to guarantee the policy, will all involve the adjustment of interests between regions and departments. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate for more consultation and find the best solution through consultation.

Our current industrial policy has obvious characteristics of rectification and order. The environment of rectification and adjustment requires appropriate strengthening of planning, which provides us with an excellent opportunity to adjust the industrial and product structures. The plan should be formulated based on the industrial policy to determine the goal of total balance; the industrial policy is a powerful guarantee for achieving the planning goal. Therefore, fully implementing the national industrial policy should seize this opportunity, first focusing on solving the existing practical problems, and doing some effective work in a down-to-earth manner. Otherwise, we will fall back into the situation of "wanting investment and competing for projects," or stay in the stage of discussion and planning, without taking practical steps.

    全面贯彻执行国家产业政策
    本报评论员
    今年3月，国务院公布了关于当前产业政策要点的决定。4个月来，不少地区和部门在认真组织学习、领会精神实质的基础上，不失时机地着手制订实施办法。沪、浙、辽等省市还根据国家产业政策导向，对本地区的产业、产品结构作了初步调整，收到了一定效果。
    国家正式提出一个比较系统而明确的产业政策，这是建国40年来第一次。它不仅对加强和改善经济宏观管理，建立、健全宏观调控体系，有着重要意义；而且为治理整顿、调整经济结构提供了依据，使各地区、部门和企业发展生产建设有了正确导向，从而对全国经济建设持续稳定发展将产生重大作用和影响。
    我们过去对产业政策的重要作用和意义没有足够的认识，有的同志甚至没有产业政策的观念。我们不是讲发展生产力吗？国家资源的合理分配和配置，是发展生产力必须解决的基本问题，而这正是产业政策的内容。产业政策不正确或不明确，必然造成结构性的失调，结构性失调所造成的生产力浪费，可以说是最大的浪费。想想看，由于能源不足，许多工厂开三停四，这中间的浪费有多大？这时再往长线上投资摆项目，与其说是建设，不如说是浪费。我国企业的经济效益不高，与产业结构不合理有密切关系。
    产业政策是影响以致决定我国资源配置、生产力布局、经济效益和经济后劲的基础性政策。且不说搞建设，就是制订改革开放的措施和步骤，也必须考虑到这项政策并促进它的贯彻。有人说产业政策是改革和发展的结合部，是有道理的。
    目前，我国国民经济发展中，供需总量矛盾尚未缓解，结构性矛盾又愈来愈突出。治理整顿既要在需求总量上压缩规模，又要逐步解决结构不合理的问题。按照国家产业政策要求进行调整，该下的下，该上的上。这样，可收一箭双雕之效，既使总量达到平衡，又使结构趋向合理。因此，贯彻执行产业政策如何，将决定着我们治理整顿是否取得根本性的成效。
    落实国家产业政策难度不小。比如，冶金等工业要限制的主要是“几小”，而“几小”大都属乡镇企业，这就会同地方利益发生一定矛盾。而且改革以来，地方权力扩大后，各地有了土地、资金、电力、交通、物资、外汇等一定的支配权力，也很容易从局部利益出发想干什么就干什么。因此，这就需要在提高对产业政策重要性认识的同时，做好具体的协调和组织工作。
    维护国家产业政策的整体性，至关重要。当前的产业政策既从国家的整体利益出发，贯彻了治理整顿的要求，又为适应各地区的不同情况，照顾到地方的利益。国家宏观调控部门，要根据产业政策，制订必要的、有力的倾斜性措施，作出鲜明而有实效的导向；各地则要按照产业政策的要求和本地情况，确定要限制或停止发展的产业、产品，或者重点鼓励、支持发展的产业、产品。国家产业政策的实施，和它的具体化、地区化，以及保障政策措施的制定，都将涉及地区与部门之间的利益调整。因此，需要提倡多协商，通过协商寻找解决问题的最佳结合点。
    我国当前的产业政策，具有明显的治乱性质和特点。治理整顿的大环境，需要适当加强计划性，这为我们调整产业、产品结构提供了极好时机。计划要根据产业政策来制定，确定总量平衡的目标；产业政策又是实现计划目标的有力保证。因此，全面贯彻执行国家产业政策，就要很好地抓住这个有利时机，首先立足于解决当前存在的实际问题，扎扎实实地做些有效工作。不然，就会重新陷入“要投资、争项目”的境地，或者停留在议论、拟订规划上面，而迈不开实际的步伐。
