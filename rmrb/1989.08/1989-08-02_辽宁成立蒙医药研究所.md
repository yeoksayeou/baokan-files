Liaoning Establishes Mongolian Medicine Research Institute

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 2nd: The Liaoning Province Mongolian Medicine Research Institute was recently officially named and established in Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County.

To promote and develop the independent system of Mongolian medicine, the late renowned Mongolian doctor Xingbulide initiated and, with approval from higher authorities, established the County Mongolian Medicine Research Institute in Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County in 1979. This marked the end of the era of Mongolian medicine being operated in a scattered manner for hundreds of years. This institute has made significant contributions to the health of people of all ethnic groups. To further improve and develop the Mongolian medicine industry, Liaoning Province has decided to change the leadership structure, shifting from county leadership to direct leadership by the Provincial Health Department, thereby strengthening scientific management.

    辽宁成立蒙医药研究所
    新华社沈阳八月二日电  辽宁省蒙医药研究所最近在阜新蒙古族自治县正式命名成立。
    为发扬光大有独立体系的蒙医药工业，由已故著名蒙医邢布力得倡导、经上级批准于一九七九年在阜新蒙古族自治县成立了县蒙医研究所。从此，结束了蒙医分散经营数百年的历史。这个研究所为各族人民的健康服务，做出了很大贡献。为了进一步提高、发展蒙医药事业，辽宁省决定在领导体制上予以改变，原来由县领导改为由省卫生厅直接领导，加强科学管理。
