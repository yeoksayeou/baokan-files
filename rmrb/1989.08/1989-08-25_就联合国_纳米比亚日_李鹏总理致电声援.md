		In support of the United Nations "Namibia Day," Premier Li Peng today sent a telegram of support to Peter Zuzek, Chairman of the United Nations Council for Namibia. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

		New York
		United Nations Council for Namibia Chairman Peter Zuzek:

		On the occasion of the commemoration of the United Nations "Namibia Day," I, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extend our support and solidarity to the United Nations Council for Namibia. I express my admiration for the tremendous efforts made by the Council, chaired by you, in mobilizing the international community to support the Namibian people's struggle for national independence.

		Since its establishment, the Council for Namibia has been tirelessly working to implement relevant United Nations resolutions, supporting the Namibian people's just struggle for national independence. It has played an active role and won widespread praise from the international community.

		Currently, the process of Namibia's independence has entered a critical stage. The international community should urge the South African authorities to strictly adhere to the relevant agreements, fulfill their promises, and ensure that Namibia holds free and fair elections under effective United Nations supervision, achieving independence as scheduled. We believe that the international community will continue to provide strong support and assistance to the Namibian people.

		The Chinese government and people will, as always, actively support the just struggle of the Namibian people. We firmly believe that, with the support of the peoples of all countries, the Namibian people, holding high the banner of independence and state-building, strengthening unity, and marching in step, will surely achieve national independence and liberation.

		Li Peng
		Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
		Beijing, August 25, 1989
