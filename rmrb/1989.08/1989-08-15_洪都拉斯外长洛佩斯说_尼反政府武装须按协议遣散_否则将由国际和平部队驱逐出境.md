    Honduras Foreign Minister Lopez Says
    Nicaraguan Anti-Government Forces Must Be Dispersed According to Agreement
    Otherwise Will Be Expelled by International Peacekeeping Forces

    Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, August 14: Honduras Foreign Minister Lopez stated that the Nicaraguan anti-government forces stationed in Honduras must comply with the agreement reached by the heads of state of the five Central American countries. Otherwise, they will be expelled by international peacekeeping forces.

    Foreign Minister Lopez made these remarks in a televised speech on the evening of the 13th. He said that the International Support and Verification Committee, which includes the secretaries-general of the United Nations and the Organization of American States, will accept the weapons and equipment of the dispersed Nicaraguan anti-government forces as scheduled.

    Regarding the military leaders of certain anti-government forces threatening not to comply with the dispersal, Foreign Minister Lopez said that dispersal is based on the principle of voluntariness. However, voluntary dispersal does not mean that they have the right to deny the agreement reached by the five presidents. Lopez said that preliminary agreements have been reached with some governments to accept some of the dispersed personnel. However, most of them will return to Nicaragua under the guarantee of the Nicaraguan government and the international committee to participate in the country's political process and economic activities. He revealed that according to figures obtained by the Honduran government, the Nicaraguan anti-government forces currently stationed in Honduras have 10,000 military personnel and 30,000 to 35,000 family members.

    He admitted that the U.S. government had indeed pressured Honduras to insist on postponing the dispersal of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces until after the Nicaraguan elections in February next year during the summit. This foreign minister also said that the most intense and bloodiest conflict in Central America is not in Nicaragua, but in El Salvador.

    洪都拉斯外长洛佩斯说
    尼反政府武装须按协议遣散
    否则将由国际和平部队驱逐出境
    本报特古西加尔巴（洪都拉斯）8月14日电　记者郭伟成报道：洪都拉斯外交部长洛佩斯说，驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的尼加拉瓜反政府武装必须服从中美洲五国首脑达成的遣散协议，否则，将由国际和平部队将其驱逐出境。
    洛佩斯外长是13日晚间在电视讲话中作出上述表示的。他说，由联合国及美洲国家组织两位秘书长参与的国际支持及核查委员会将如期接受尼加拉瓜反政装遣散后的武器装备。
    对于某些反政府武装的军事头目扬言不服从遣散，洪都拉斯外长说，遣散是要建立在自愿的原则上的；但是，自愿遣散并不等于说可以有权否定五国总统达成的协议。洛佩斯说，已经与某些政府达成了初步协议，接受部分遣散人员；但是，大多数人要在尼加拉瓜政府与国际委员会的保证下返回尼加拉瓜参加国内的政治进程与经济活动。他透露，根据洪都拉斯政府掌握的数字，驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的尼加拉瓜反政府武装目前拥有军事人员1万人；家属3万到3.5万人。
    他承认，美国政府的确向洪都拉斯施加了压力，要求洪都拉斯在首脑会议上坚持把对尼反的遣散推迟到明年2月尼加拉瓜大选以后。这位外长还说，中美洲冲突最激烈、流血最多的不是尼加拉瓜，而是萨尔瓦多。
