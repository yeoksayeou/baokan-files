    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 9th.

    The State Council recently reiterated its support for the "Star Spark Plan," which aims to bring science and technology to rural areas and township enterprises. This plan is seen as an effective measure to promote the application of science and technology in rural economic development. This year, 320 national-level "Star Spark Plan" projects have been arranged across the country. These projects will focus on strengthening the science and technology service system, industrial clusters, and "Star Spark" technology-intensive zones to promote the formation and development of rural pillar industries.

    Since 1986, the "Star Spark" initiative has spread to over 2,000 counties and cities nationwide. By the end of 1988, more than 500 demonstration enterprises and over 100 types of technology and equipment suitable for township enterprises and rural needs have been introduced to society. Nearly 4 million technical and managerial personnel have been trained for rural areas. The implementation of this plan has added over 13 billion yuan in production value, generated 3.6 billion yuan in taxes, and saved or earned over 1.6 billion US dollars. The input-output ratio is above 1:5. A number of industrial clusters and socialized service organizations have been initially established, playing a role in technological demonstration and guidance for the formation of characteristic pillar industries in different regions.

    According to a survey, the "Star Spark Plan" requires all projects to have actual technological development content and supporting scientific and technological units. The survey of 120 "Star Spark" enterprises found that each enterprise has an average of more than 20 technical personnel and at least one "technological backer." Additionally, the plan emphasizes comprehensive benefits and clearly stipulates the importance of environmental protection.

    Officials from the State Science and Technology Commission believe that the current efforts to rectify the economic environment, rectify economic order, appropriately reduce the scale of township enterprises, and adjust the industrial structure of township enterprises have created new opportunities for the implementation of the "Star Spark Plan."

    引入科学技术　振兴农村经济
    国家级星火项目今年安排320个
    本报讯　记者王友恭从国家科委获悉：国务院负责人最近又一次肯定了力求把科学技术引入农村和乡镇企业的“星火计划”，认为它是促进科技为农村经济发展服务的一个很好的措施。今年在全国又安排了320个国家级“星火计划”项目，将大力加强科技服务体系、产业集团和“星火”技术密集区的建设，以推动农村支柱产业形成和发展。
  自1986年以来，“科技星火”目前已遍及全国2000多个市、县。到1988年底，已向社会推出500多个示范企业，100多种适于乡镇企业和农村需要的技术装备，为农村培训技术骨干和管理人员近400万名。该计划实施以来已新增产值130多亿元，创利税36亿元，节汇、创汇计16亿多美元，投入产出比在1∶5以上。初步建立了一批产业集团和社会化的服务组织，为在不同地区形成各具特色的支柱产业发挥了科技示范和引导作用。
    据调查，“星火计划”规定所有项目都要有技术开发的实际内容和科技依托单位。据对120个“星火”企业的调查，每个“星火”企业中平均有20多名科技人员，至少有一个“科技靠山”。此外，该计划强调综合效益，明确规定要重视对环境的保护。
    国家科委有关负责同志认为，当前治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，适当压缩乡镇企业，调整乡镇企业产业结构的新形势，为“星火计划”的实施创造了新的环境和机遇。
