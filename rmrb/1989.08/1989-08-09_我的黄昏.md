Title: My Twilight

The setting sun is like blood. Large patches of red paint the sky like a Van Gogh modernist painting, and the remaining few drops of red filter through the gaps in the trees, falling on the people walking along the path. The box-like buildings are stacked layer upon layer, weaving many confusing life stories.

It has been a long time, my twilight.

Looking at the distant sunset, one feels that the heart stretches endlessly, and the body feels light and comfortable. Gazing at the wisps of clouds on the horizon, one feels a long-lasting joy and contentment.

Sometimes, burdened by worldly concerns, I dare not be careless. My clothes are already many, yet I must add a few more layers, squeezing my swollen body and my troubled soul. Only you, dear twilight, can make me forget the weight outside.

Pick up any book, flip to any page, and leisurely walk into the gradually darkening twilight. Read a few lines, or look up at the sky that seems to understand and not understand, and read the free and easy clouds. The heart will have boundless thoughts, and the accumulated worries will be released. I can take off those extra layers of clothing.

The cool breeze brushes against my face, and I think nature also has wandering thoughts. When those thoughts condense, they turn into rain and snow, accompanied by the howls of "The Wolf of the North" and the voice of "I Have No Grievances Against You," drifting freely in the twilight.

The evening glow sheds its bright and dazzling outer garment, dancing a classical waltz on the stage of twilight, making one feel it is a profound philosophical proposition.

Is twilight decay or a kind of maturity? One should take twilight, place it on the lips, and blow it into a small boat, drifting in the ocean of youthful freedom, tasting the ultimate joy of life.

The universe is vast, yet it is difficult to draw a satisfying path; the palm is small, yet it has the joy of controlling the clouds and rain. One should be carefree, for carefreeness is an eternal charm. When one is carefree, everything becomes clear and bright.

"Chilly spring wind blows away the wine, slightly cold, the setting sun on the hill welcomes me. Looking back, the desolate place, returning, there is neither wind nor rain."

I do not intend to shirk responsibility, knowing that there must be action before there can be rest. There must be fatigue before there can be comfort, especially since my life has a real sense of fulfillment.

In life, I will cherish such twilights. I wish to embrace the twilight that gives me affection, to fully enjoy this luxurious tenderness. Twilight adorns my world, narrates my life, and interprets my love.

I do not belong to twilight, but I possess twilight.

Oh, my twilight.

### 我的黄昏

    我的黄昏
    戴竹帛
    残阳如血。大团大团的红把天涂抹得如凡高的现代派画，余下的几滴红透过林中的缝隙洒落在小径中漫步的行人们的身上。火柴盒式的楼房层层叠叠，编织着许多扑朔迷离的人生故事。
    久违了，我的黄昏。
    望望那远远的落日，会觉得心无穷无尽地远了，身子空落得很轻很舒坦，痴痴地望着那缕缕天边的彩霞飘动，心里就有一份长长的快乐和适意。
    有时候，被功利所累，使我不敢轻慢，衣服穿得本来就很多，还得套上几层，挤压着膨胀的身躯，挤压痛苦的心灵。唯有你——可爱的黄昏方使我忘却外面的沉重。
    任意拿一本书，任意地翻到某一页，款款地走进那渐渐暗下来的黄昏里，随便读上几行间或抬头去读头顶上那似懂非懂的天空，去读自由自在的彩云，心里就有了海阔天空般的遐思，那堆积的烦忧此时都释放了，我可以脱下那几件多余的服装了。
    凉凉的风飘拂在脸上，我想大自然也和我一样有飘忽不定的思绪，那思绪凝结了，就变成了雨雪，伴着“北方的狼”的嚎叫和“我没有怨你”的声音，在黄昏里无牵挂地飘荡。
    晚霞脱下轻佻灿烂的外衣洒脱地在黄昏这个大舞台上跳着古典华尔兹，使人感到那是一道深奥的哲学命题。
    黄昏是衰老还是一种成熟？应把黄昏捧来合在唇间，吹成一叶轻舟，荡漾在青春自由的海洋中，饱尝生活的终极快乐。
    宇宙虽大，实难划下一道畅快淋漓的轨道；掌间虽小，却有翻云覆雨的快乐。应该潇洒是永远的魅力，潇洒起来，凡事就变得晴空万里。
    “料峭春风吹酒醒，微冷，山头斜照却相迎。回首向来，萧瑟处，归去，也无风雨也无晴。”
    我无意推卸沉重，深知有行才有止。有疲顿才有惬意，何况在我的生命中有一种实在的充实。
    在人生中，我会珍惜这样的黄昏，我愿投到给我抚爱的黄昏的怀抱中，去尽心享受一下这奢侈的柔情。黄昏点缀着我的世界，演绎着我的人生，阐释着我的爱情。
    我不属于黄昏，但我拥有黄昏。
    哦，我的黄昏。
