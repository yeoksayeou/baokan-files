The People's Daily reports: According to reporters Lié Jǐng and Yuè Fùróng, "From now on, any major project decisions will be sent to experts and scholars for discussion and verification before being submitted to the provincial government's executive meeting, achieving scientific and democratic decision-making." This was stated by Governor Wáng Zhàoguó recently at the 41st Fujian Science and Technology Monthly Forum.

It is understood that the Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Monthly Forum began at the end of 1984 and has since become institutionalized, held basically once a month. The forum determines topics based on provincial conditions and invites relevant experts to prepare. The meetings are chaired by the main leaders of the provincial Party Committee and government. Each time, about 20 experts are invited to listen to their suggestions on developing Fujian's economy. Over the past four years, the members of the provincial Party Committee and vice governors and above have basically all participated in the forum, with over 1,500 science and technology personnel attending. The forum has produced good results.

	* Democratic wisdom, promoting democratic decision-making. The forum has discussed issues such as energy development, transportation, raw material industries, foreign exchange-earning agriculture, and marine strategies. Many insightful views and suggestions have been adopted by provincial leaders and have been transformed into decision-making thoughts. At the fine chemical industry forum, experts strongly advocated for organizing scientific and technological forces to digest and absorb over 100 imported Kodak photochemical materials, striving for gradual domestic production. Provincial leaders accepted the suggestion and organized its implementation. Now, 78 samples have been produced, saving the country a large amount of foreign exchange. Some suggestions, even if they cannot produce immediate benefits, will have a subtle influence on leadership decision-making.

	* The relationship between leaders and science and technology personnel has been strengthened, and the prestige of the Party and government in the scientific community has been enhanced. At the forum, leaders and science and technology personnel have open and frank discussions, equal dialogue, and a harmonious atmosphere. The forum has had a significant impact in Fujian's scientific community. Many science and technology personnel say that provincial leaders respect knowledge and talent so much, and Fujian has great hope.

	* Science and technology personnel participate in decision-making consultations, igniting their patriotic enthusiasm. Science and technology personnel, in preparation for their speeches, often conduct extensive investigations and research in advance, deeply understanding the root causes of problems and solutions. Professor Cài Qǐruì, who has been engaged in basic discipline research for many years, participated in the forum and submitted a written suggestion for the development of Fujian's coal chemical industry. Provincial leaders quickly approved it for relevant departments to study and implement, deeply moving Professor Cài, who expressed to the Science and Technology Association that he would do his best in the future whenever he could be of use.

It is understood that the Science and Technology Monthly Forum has been promoted throughout the province. Eight cities and more than half of the counties have held similar forums in the form of quarterly forums and consultation meetings according to local characteristics. Scientific and democratic decision-making is being institutionalized in Fujian.

    福建科技月谈会制度化  推动省领导决策民主化
    本报讯　记者廖玒、岳富荣报道：“今后凡是决策重大项目，都要在送省政府常务会议之前，先送给专家学者论证和讨论，实现决策科学化、民主化。”这是王兆国省长最近在福建第41次科技月谈会上说的。
    据悉，福建省科技月谈会开始于1984年底，现在已形成制度，基本上每月一次。月谈会根据省情，事先确定专题，请有关专家做好准备。会议由省委、省府主要领导同志主持。每次邀请一二十名专家，听取他们对发展福建经济的建议。4年多来，省委常委和副省长以上的领导同志基本都参加过月谈会，与会科技人员达1500多人次。月谈会产生了良好的效果。
    ——民主集智，推动决策民主化。月谈会已就能源开发、交通运输、原材料工业、创汇农业、海洋战略等问题进行了研讨，许多精辟见解和建议被省领导采纳，已转化为决策思想。在精细化工月谈会上，专家们强烈要求组织科技力量对引进的100多种柯达感光材料进行消化吸收，争取逐步国产化，省领导接受建议，组织实施，现在已拿出78种样品，为国家节省了大量外汇。有的建议，即使不能马上产生效益，对领导决策也会起到潜移默化的作用。
    ——密切了领导同志与科技人员关系，提高了党和政府在科技界的威信。在月谈会上，领导同志与科技人员畅谈思想，开诚布公，平等对话，气氛和谐。月谈会在福建科技界反响巨大，许多科技人员说，省领导如此尊重知识，尊重人才，福建大有希望。
    ——科技人员参与决策咨询，激发了他们的报国热情。科技人员为准备发言，事先往往做大量的考察调研工作，深入了解问题的症结和解决对策。多年从事基础学科研究的老教授蔡启瑞，参加月谈会后，提出发展福建燃化工业的书面建议，省领导很快批给有关部门研究落实，蔡教授深受感动，向科协表示，今后凡是能用得上我的地方，我当尽力而为。
    据了解，科技月谈会已在全省各地推广，已有8个地市、一半以上的县根据本地特点举办类似月谈会形式的季谈会、恳谈会。决策科学化、民主化正在福建形成制度。
