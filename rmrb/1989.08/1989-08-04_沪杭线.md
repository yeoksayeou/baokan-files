As the sun sets,
The journey is bathed in the glow of twilight;
My heart lingers like the setting sun.
I want to return to my hometown, but I can't recognize it,
I dare not say it's the last train.
The small station brings the scenery of March,
The platform bustles with people carrying baskets and bags;
A little girl crosses the switch;
Only the beautiful place names of Jiangnan remain unchanged.
I miss your avenues, I miss your curves,
I remember the endless willows and rapeseed flowers;
The river under the roaring iron bridge flows with the accent of my hometown.
The chimneys of the countryside emit green mulberry smoke,
Cement pieces are laid in the fields,
Blue and white advertisement walls stretch on.
There are cows plowing and people hoeing,
The manure shovel waters the vegetable patch by the house,
The silhouette of barefoot people walking on the embankment.
Quarrels are the days of the past,
Gaze is the sharpness of others.
Leaving in haste, returning in vain,
The entire journey is bathed in the glow of twilight,
My heart is as serene as the setting sun.

   沪杭线
   周民
   日落的时候，
   旅程浴着黄昏光；
   我的心盘桓如夕阳。
   要回故乡、难辨故乡，
   不敢说最后一班。
   小站送来三月的风景，
   提筐拎包的月台在骚动，
   小女孩跨过道岔；
   只有江南美丽的地名不改。
   想你的林荫、想你的弯道，
   忆垂柳和菜花无边；
   轰然的铁桥下河水淌着乡音。
   乡村的烟囱挤出桑青，
   水泥制件铺在田野，
   蓝底白字的广告墙绵延。
   有牛犁人锄的细作，
   粪勺浇着宅边菜畦，
   赤脚走在田埂上的剪影。
   争执是过去的日子，
   对视是别人的敏锐。
   去匆匆，回也空空，
   全程浴着黄昏光，
   我的心境如夕阳的宁静。
