The book "Contemporary Chinese Finance," edited by Chen Rulong, has been published by the Chinese Social Sciences Press. The book chronicles, in chronological order and by category, the tremendous achievements made in fiscal work from the founding of New China to 1985, and does not shy away from the severe setbacks suffered under the influence of "leftist" errors. It summarizes the experiences of China's fiscal work.

1. Developing the economy is the foundation for increasing fiscal revenue.

Increasing fiscal revenue through economic development is the basic principle of generating wealth. This is the well-known policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" proposed by Mao Zedong. In 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out in the report on the Second Five-Year Plan: "The experience of many years is: our fiscal revenue must be based on economic development." The starting point and focus of doing a good job in fiscal work and increasing fiscal revenue is first and foremost to develop the economy. Developing the economy is not about blindly developing any kind of economy, but rather to develop it in a planned and coordinated manner. This requires fully leveraging the functions of the state's fiscal system, actively and correctly handling various proportional relationships and the interests of all parties. For example, in the relationship between industry and agriculture, it is necessary to emphasize the foundation of socialist industrialization, while also prioritizing agriculture, industry, and light industry in that order, and to pay special attention to the foundational role of agriculture in our country. Within the industry, it is also necessary to maintain an appropriate structural proportion. In the relationship between the central government and local governments, between concentration and decentralization, it is necessary to maintain the central government's unified leadership while also allowing for appropriate decentralization, to avoid over-centralization and rigidity, and to prevent the dispersion of financial resources, leading to macroeconomic instability, and so on. During periods such as economic recovery, the First Five-Year Plan, and several economic adjustments, macroeconomic decisions were correct, and the functions of the state's fiscal system were fully utilized, leading to increased fiscal revenue. This accumulated a large amount of construction funds for the country, meeting the needs of society and various undertakings, promoting economic development and social stability. However, during the "Great Leap Forward" and especially the "Cultural Revolution," blind advancement and the severe expansion of class struggle led to the weakening of the state's fiscal functions, resulting in "false surpluses and real deficits" and multiple severe disruptions, which are clear examples.

2. Adhere to thrift and emphasize economic efficiency.

The principles of financial management require both increasing revenue and reducing expenditures; production and thrift must go hand in hand. The book provides detailed accounts of various campaigns to increase production and reduce expenditures. Although the specific conditions of each historical period are different, and the current national advocacy of increasing production and reducing expenditures differs significantly from the past, restoring and carrying forward the fine traditions and styles of hard work, thrift, and building the country through hard work, as well as the leadership and the masses sharing hardships and the Communist Party members leading the way in hard work, are still universally meaningful for overcoming difficulties, developing productive forces, eliminating corruption within the party and society, and building socialist spiritual civilization.

In the allocation and use of financial resources, the principles of doing as much as possible with available funds, doing more with less, and ensuring that every expenditure has a clear purpose must be adhered to. Only high efficiency can lead to genuine high speed. Not only during times of fiscal difficulties should expenditures be tightened and a frugal lifestyle be adopted, but even during times of improved and abundant fiscal conditions, one must not forget past mistakes and repeat them. Adhering to thrift and emphasizing economic efficiency is always an important principle of financial management.

3. Stabilize the economy and maintain basic balance between fiscal revenue and expenditure.

The scale of construction must be in line with the country's financial and material capabilities. Whether it is in line or not is the dividing line between economic stability and instability. It is necessary to find some constraints to prevent the danger of construction scales exceeding national capabilities. Fiscal revenue and expenditure, as well as bank credit, must be balanced, and there should be a slight surplus. Maintaining the basic balance of finance, credit, materials, and foreign exchange is the fundamental method for organizing the balance between social total supply and total demand. Among the four balances, fiscal revenue and expenditure hold a crucial position. Over the past thirty-plus years, China's economy has shifted from coordinated development to imbalanced fluctuations, often first reflecting in the fiscal realm. To adjust imbalanced proportional relationships, it is often necessary to start with balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and adjusting the revenue and expenditure structure, activating economic levers, using various regulatory measures, and conducting comprehensive balancing. The initial financial and economic unification and price stabilization, as well as the two subsequent economic adjustments, are examples of this. In the current stage, based on the achievements of fiscal reform, conducting rectification and adjustment, appropriately adjusting the allocation of financial resources and the revenue and expenditure structure, and establishing a stable and balanced socialist fiscal system, is also the case. In this regard, the book does not agree with the view of "deficit is harmless" and analyzes the causes and serious consequences of fiscal deficits, as well as the fundamental ways to solve fiscal deficits, based on different national conditions, distinguishing between temporary fiscal deficits and deficit fiscal policies. It also puts forward important points of view.

History repeatedly proves: in the process of socialist construction, understanding national conditions, making democratic and scientific macro-decisions, paying attention to comprehensive balancing, proceeding step by step, maintaining basic balance between fiscal revenue and expenditure, and making the people happy, our cause will advance; conversely, exaggerating subjective will, being arrogant and complacent, seeking quick results, leading to a large number of deficits, resulting in various out-of-control situations and tensions, the result is that haste makes waste.

    三十多年财政工作的基本经验是什么？
    发展经济　讲求效益　量力而行——《当代中国财政》述评
    杜禹
    由陈如龙主编的《当代中国财政》，已由中国社会科学出版社出版。该书按时序又分门别类地记叙了新中国成立至1985年财政工作所取得的巨大成绩，也不讳言在“左”的错误影响下遭受的严重挫折，总结了我国财政工作的经验。
    一、发展经济是增加财政收入的基础。
    从发展经济来增加财政收入，是生财之道的基本原则。这就是人们所熟知的毛泽东提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的总方针。1956年周总理在“二五”计划报告中也指出：“多年来的经验是：我们的财政收入必须建立在经济发展的基础上。”做好财政工作、增加财政收入的出发点和着眼点，首先在于发展经济。发展经济不是盲目地发展任何一种经济，而是要有计划协调地发展。这就需要充分发挥国家财政的职能作用，能动地正确处理各种比例关系和各方面的利益。如：在工农业关系上，既要重视奠定社会主义工业化的基础，又要以农轻重为序，十分重视农业在我国的基础作用；在工业内部又要保持适当的结构比例。在中央与地方、集中与分散的关系上，既要坚持中央的集中统一，又要有适当的分权，既要克服统得过多过死，也要注意财力过于分散，造成宏观失控等等。像经济恢复、“一五”计划、几次经济调整时期，宏观决策正确，充分发挥国家财政的职能作用，财政收入增加，为国家积累了大量建设资金，满足了社会和各项事业发展需要，促进了经济发展和安定团结；而在“大跃进”，特别是“文革”时期，盲目冒进，阶级斗争严重扩大化，导致国家财政职能削弱，出现“假结余、真赤字”和多次严重破坏，就是明显例证。
    二、坚持勤俭节约和讲求经济效益。
    理财之道，既要开源，又要节流；增产与节约并重。书中对历次开展增产节约运动，都有比较详细的记述。尽管每个历史时期具体条件不同，现在国家倡导的增产节约、增收节支，与当时情况也有很大差异。但是，恢复和发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业，领导与群众同甘共苦、共产党员吃苦在前的优良传统和作风，对于克服困难，发展社会生产力，铲除党内和社会上腐败之风，建设社会主义精神文明，仍具有普遍意义。
    在财力的安排和使用上，要坚持有多少钱办多少事和少花钱多办事，花钱一定要问效果的原则。只有高效益，才会有真正的高速度。不仅财政困难时，要紧缩支出，过紧日子，即使是财政状况好转和宽裕的时候，也绝不能“好了疮疤忘了疼”，重蹈以往失误。坚持勤俭节约和讲求经济效益，始终是理财的重要原则。
    三、稳定经济，坚持财政收支基本平衡。
    建设规模大小必须和国家的财力物力相适应。适应还是不适应，这是经济稳定或不稳定的界限。要寻找一些制约方法，来防止经济建设规模超过国力的危险。财政收支和银行信贷必须平衡，而且应该略有节余。坚持财政、信贷、物资、外汇的基本平衡是组织社会总供给与总需求平衡的基本方法。而财政收支平衡在四大平衡中又具有举足轻重的地位。30多年来，我国经济由协调发展变为失调起伏，往往先从财政上反映，要调整失调的比例关系，也往往要从平衡财政收支和调整收支结构入手，启动经济杠杆，运用各种调节手段，进行综合平衡。建国初期统一财经、稳定物价和后来的两次经济调整是这样。现阶段，在财政改革取得成就的基础上，进行治理整顿，适当调整财力分配和收支结构，建立稳定的、平衡的社会主义财政，也是这样。与此相联系，书中不赞成那种“赤字无害”的观点，并就国情不同，区别一时的财政赤字与赤字财政政策，分析财政赤字产生的原因及其严重后果，解决财政赤字的根本途径等问题，提出了重要的论点。
    历史反复证明：在社会主义建设过程中，掌握国情，宏观决策民主和科学化，注重综合平衡，循序渐进，财政收支基本平衡，人民高兴，我们的事业就前进；反之，夸大主观意志，骄傲自满，急于求成，出现大量赤字，导致种种失控和紧张，结果是欲速则不达。
