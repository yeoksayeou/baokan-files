According to foreign news reports, former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese is suspected of accepting bribes during his tenure to secure military supply contracts for a company.

The Weidtech Company allegedly paid a total of $2 million to Meese's close friend, Walter W. Rice, and two others to "influence" Meese and other high-ranking officials to secure several military supply contracts.

A local court, after a 7-day investigation, has determined that Rice illegally received $425,000 from the company. If found guilty, he could face 45 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The court will pronounce judgment on the three suspects on October 16.

Weidtech Company was originally a small machinery factory that frequently resorted to bribing officials to secure lucrative government contracts, thereby rapidly expanding into a billion-dollar military contractor. Since the company's illegal activities were exposed at the end of 1987, it has declared bankruptcy.

The court has not yet disclosed the details of the bribery involving former Attorney General Meese.

    美前司法部长涉嫌受贿
    本报讯　据外电报道，美国前司法部长埃德温·米斯在职期间涉嫌受贿为1家公司获取军用物资订货合同。
    威德特克公司以总数200万美元买通司法部长米斯的密友瓦莱克及另外两人去“影响”米斯和其他一些高官促成若干军用订货合同。
    一地方法院经过7天的调查已认定瓦莱克曾从该公司非法获得42.5万美元。如罪行成立，将被判处45年监禁并罚款25万美元。法院定于10月16日对3名嫌疑犯进行宣判。
    威德特克公司本是一家小型机器厂，经常对掌权官员采取贿赂手段以优先赢得可获厚利的政府合同，因而不数年即暴发为拥有亿万美元的军用承包商。自1987年底该公司的非法勾当败露后，业已宣告破产。
    法院尚未公布前司法部长米斯受贿的细情。
