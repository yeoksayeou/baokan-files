The current important task for macro-control of fixed asset investment in our country is to unify ideological understanding, with improving investment benefits as the center, and to make great efforts to solve the two problems of an excessively large investment scale and an irrational investment structure.

In recent years, the investment scale has been too large, occurring in a situation where social total demand has exceeded total supply for consecutive years, leading to obvious inflation, and is supported by excessive monetary and credit issuance. Therefore, it is particularly important to first reduce investment demand.

There is an intrinsic relationship of mutual promotion and constraint between investment and economic growth. Over a relatively long period, investment, on the one hand, takes away labor, means of production, and means of subsistence from society, and on the other hand, provides effective products to society, meeting the needs of people's lives, production, and social development, playing an important role in promoting social expanded reproduction. However, it should also be noted that investment growth is based on economic development. It is a form of economic activity where input (demand) comes first and output (supply) comes later, with a long cycle. Many construction projects take several years, a decade, or even several decades to complete and start production. Over a relatively long period, there is only demand without effective supply. There is an objective quantitative limit to how much of the social total product can be used for investment in a certain period. The size of the investment scale is constrained by national strength. If the investment scale is too large, disregarding the capacity of the national economy to bear it, not only will it affect people's lives and the normal production of existing enterprises, making it difficult to sustain the spread of construction projects, resulting in a long front and poor results, but in severe cases, it will also disrupt the comprehensive balance of the national economy, forcing adjustments, and paying a huge price.

However, in recent years, the investment scale in our country has been consistently large, with the fixed asset investment rate (the proportion of fixed asset investment to national income) exceeding 30% for four consecutive years. In 1988, the total investment scale of ongoing projects nationwide reached about 1.3 trillion yuan, obviously exceeding the national strength's capacity to bear. It is noteworthy that the investment scale is currently too large in a situation where social total demand has exceeded total supply for consecutive years, leading to obvious inflation, and is supported by excessive monetary and credit issuance, with relatively large hidden dangers. Under the condition of the existence of commodity-monetary relations, the social total product and national income are divided into material movement and value movement. Excessive issuance of money through credit institutions beyond the level of economic growth will cause the monetary form of social total demand to exceed the material form of social total supply, forming inflation. The complexity of the problem lies not only in the fact that the reasonable limit of monetary circulation is somewhat vague and the magical power of bank credit to create money supply is not widely known, but also because a loan for investment builds a real project, while excessive credit issuance faces all social products. The resulting devaluation of money often occurs with a delay, making it easy to create the illusion that expanding investment loans gains more than it loses. We should have a clear understanding of this.

The dual inflation of investment demand and consumption demand, and to a large extent, the expansion of investment driven by consumption demand, is an important feature different from the past. The inflation of consumption demand is mainly manifested in the fact that the expansion of employment and the growth of residents' monetary income have exceeded the growth of social labor productivity, and the growth of social purchasing power has exceeded the growth of commodity supply. Overheated consumption demand and the pressure to expand employment have become a major factor leading to excessive monetary and credit issuance. This not only drives local governments and enterprises to expand investment in various ways, driving the over-fast development of consumer goods processing industries, but also makes the production of energy, transportation, and other sectors lag behind, exacerbating the contradiction of supply not meeting demand, making the task of adjusting the investment structure even more arduous. Since consumption demand is rigid, controlling the growth of consumption demand is relatively difficult. Therefore, first reducing investment demand is particularly important for reducing social total demand, curbing inflation, and stabilizing the overall economic situation.

The core of adjusting the total amount of investment is to strictly control the total scale of credit issuance. Investment growth should be adapted to economic growth, and the total scale of ongoing projects and annual investment should be controlled simultaneously.

The core of adjusting the total amount of investment is to adhere to the principle of comprehensive balance of the national economy, determine the speed and scale of investment growth according to the requirements of improving the economic environment and the capacity of national strength to bear, and ensure that investment growth is adapted to economic growth. First, economic development should be stable and not overheated. Only when the economy develops stably can the speed and total scale of investment growth be stable. The current problem lies in the overheated economic development. Overheated economic development inevitably requires expanding the investment scale for support. Therefore, on the basis of stable development of the national economy, the social product and national income should first be arranged for living and production, and then for investment, and the proportion of the three should be basically stable year by year. In this way, investment growth can be basically consistent with economic growth. Practice has proven that in a situation of supply shortage in our country, expanding construction by issuing more tickets will inevitably lead to inflation, affecting the progress of reform and development.

Next, fiscal, credit, material, and foreign exchange should be comprehensively balanced, which is the key to total balance. Fiscal and credit are important forms of state participation in the distribution and redistribution of social products and national income, although they are only part of social funds, they play an extremely important role in the comprehensive balance of the national economy. Regardless of the type, social total demand exceeding total supply must be reflected through fiscal deficits and credit gaps, and ultimately must be realized through excessive monetary issuance. Since 1979, the fiscal deficit has been overdrawn from banks for many years, and the credit issuance has far exceeded the economic demand. In this situation, controlling the total amount of investment must implement a dual-tight policy of fiscal and banking. Currently, our country's fiscal deficit is a hard deficit after including domestic and foreign debt income, which should be paid attention to, and efforts should be made to study the ways for the fiscal to achieve self-balance and have a slight surplus through increasing revenue and saving expenditure. Banks should strictly control the total scale of credit issuance, keep the investment credit within the range that bank funds can bear, and implement a planned management of investment loans, prohibit non-bank financial institutions from engaging in investment credit activities, and resolutely limit the expansion of investment scale through social fundraising. Banks are the total gate for controlling social total demand and should further play the role of banks in regulating investment demand.

Third, the total scale of ongoing projects and annual investment should be controlled simultaneously. The annual investment scale is the actual completed fixed asset investment amount by the state in a year, reflecting the amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources used by the state in fixed asset reproduction in a year; the total scale of ongoing projects refers to the total investment amount required for all construction projects under construction this year to be completed. If the total scale of ongoing projects is too large and the spread of construction projects is too wide, it will inevitably be like "scattering pepper," with a large amount of funds scattered and long-term occupied in unfinished projects, unable to be completed and put into production in time to form comprehensive production capacity. In severe cases, it will be necessary to clean up and adjust ongoing projects, causing greater losses and waste to the national economy. Currently, not only is our country's annual investment scale too large, but the total scale of ongoing projects is also too large. The solution lies mainly in doing a good job in the medium and long-term development plan of the national economy, calculating a scientific total scale of ongoing projects based on the possible annual investment scale that can be achieved in a period and a reasonable project construction cycle, and through the establishment of a strict project approval system, correctly handling the relationship between new projects and ongoing projects, and indeed controlling the total scale of ongoing projects within a reasonable range.

Fourth, establish a system for supplementing enterprise working capital. Currently, a large amount of self-raised funds of enterprises in our country have surged into the investment field, and working capital basically relies on bank loans, increasing the demand for working capital loans from banks. Working capital investment and fixed asset investment are inseparable components of realizing investment turnover. It is necessary to gradually change the concept that "investment" does not include working capital investment, and clearly stipulate: (1) In the future, whoever arranges fixed asset investment is responsible for the corresponding matching of working capital supply; (2) Enterprises should first supplement their working capital with their self-raised funds, and construction projects without corresponding matching working capital sources are not allowed to start construction. In this way, it can reduce the demand for fixed asset investment from the perspective of fund allocation and compress the investment scale.

Fifth, improve the interest rate mechanism. Currently, it is necessary to significantly raise the overall interest rate level, especially to raise the interest rate for investment loans. At the same time, it is necessary to change from "pre-tax repayment" to "post-tax repayment" as soon as possible, harden the enterprise budget constraint mechanism, and curb the desire of enterprises to expand by digging into the fiscal budget and competing for loans to enrich themselves, creating the basic conditions for playing the positive role of credit and interest rates.

Another issue worth noting is that with the increase in investment funds, there have been many "patchwork" projects, where in name, each party shares the investment, but in reality, the other parties often do not fully implement it, and only the bank loan is implemented. As a result, the project is "stuck on a tiger" and forces the bank to continue to increase loans. Therefore, reducing investment loans has a multiple contraction effect on controlling the investment scale.

The key to adjusting the investment structure is to solve the problem of excessively low prices of basic industrial products. In the near term, the main focus is on adjusting the distribution of national income, formulating fiscal and financial policies that match the national industrial policy, reforming the investment system, and exploring new ways to adjust the stock.

Currently, the prominent problem with the investment structure in our country is that the investment in basic industries such as energy and transportation is seriously lagging behind, affecting the coordinated development of the economy. To change this situation, the key is to solve the problem of excessively low prices of basic industrial products.

In the near term, it is necessary to adjust the distribution of national income and formulate fiscal and financial policies that match the national industrial policy. In recent years, budgetary investment has accounted for only a small percentage of total investment, making it difficult to effectively adjust the investment structure. It is of great importance to appropriately concentrate funds and increase the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national income, thereby increasing the proportion of fiscal investment in basic industries over a relatively long period. In the context of difficulties in price reform, taxation plays a direct role in curbing the development of processing industries, increasing fiscal revenue, and increasing investment in key projects. It is advisable to significantly raise the tax rates of industries restricted by the state, and to establish budgetary external funds adjustment tax, scarce resources tax, investment direction adjustment tax, etc. At the same time, it should be clear that the state-collected energy and transportation key construction funds, and the income from the issuance of key construction bonds, etc., should be set up as special accounts and concentrated for key construction investment. In terms of finance, on the basis of resolutely implementing the national industrial policy, it is necessary to implement a credit policy that tilts towards basic industries, appropriately increase the funds for key construction loans and credit sources; and to implement a differential interest rate that can truly curb long-term industries and support the development of basic industries, and to establish a corresponding fiscal subsidy interest rate system.

Next, reform the investment system and guide extra-budgetary funds to be used for investment in basic industries. Currently, a large amount of extra-budgetary funds have surged into processing industries, not only reducing the sources of investment in basic industries but also exacerbating the contradiction of tight supply in basic industries. We should speed up the supporting reform of the investment system. While decentralizing financial powers, it is also necessary to transfer part of the investment tasks in basic industries to local governments and enterprises. In this way, it can not only reduce the pressure on the state but also effectively guide local governments and enterprises to use extra-budgetary funds for investment in basic industries, promoting the adjustment of the investment structure towards rationalization from both the supply and demand sides.

Finally, the adjustment of the investment structure should focus on both stock adjustment and incremental adjustment, and explore new ways to adjust the investment structure. The incremental adjustment of the investment structure refers to the tilt of new investment allocation towards basic industries, while the stock adjustment refers to the development of the industrial structure towards rationalization through the re-combination of existing production factors. In terms of stock adjustment, the main feasible measures currently are: first, to support a part of long-term enterprises to transform production and promote the implementation of the enterprise merger system in a planned manner, to maximize the use of existing production equipment, improve efficiency, and increase the supply of market-shortage products; second, to establish and improve the trading and leasing market for idle equipment and surplus materials, and optimize asset allocation through the flow of existing production factors; third, to selectively auction some state-owned small enterprises, sell a batch of public housing, and transfer a small amount of land use rights to foreigners for a fee within the scope permitted by law, thereby concentrating and raising a large sum of funds, which are used to focus on the input of basic industries.

    控制投资规模  调整投资结构
    周汉荣
    目前我国固定资产投资宏观调节的重要任务，是统一思想认识，以提高投资效益为中心，下大力气解决投资规模偏大和投资结构不合理两个问题。
    近年投资规模偏大，是在社会总需求连年超过总供给、出现明显通货膨胀的情况下发生的，是靠货币信贷超投放来支撑的。首先压缩投资需求有着特别重要的意义。
    投资与经济增长之间有一种相互促进、相互制约的内在关系。从一段较长的时间来看，投资一方面从社会取走劳动、生产资料和生活资料，一方面向社会提供有效产品，满足人们生活、生产和社会发展的需要，对于社会扩大再生产具有重要推动作用。但同时应看到，投资增长要以经济发展为基础，它是一种投入
  （需求）在先、产出（供给）在后的经济活动，且周期长，不少建设项目要几年、十几年乃至几十年才能建成投产，在一个较长时间内只有需求不能形成有效供给。一定时期社会总产品有多少可以用于投资有一个客观的数量界限，投资规模的大小要受国力制约。如果不顾国民经济所能承受的能力，投资规模过大，不仅影响人民生活和现有企业的正常生产，使铺开的建设摊子难以为继，战线长，效果差，严重时还将破坏国民经济的综合平衡，被迫进行调整，付出巨大代价。
    但是，近几年我国投资规模一直偏大，连续四年固定资产投资率（即固定资产投资占国民生产总值的比重）超过30％，1988年全国在建工程投资总规模达到1万3千亿元左右，明显超过了国力承担的可能。值得注意的是，现在投资规模偏大是在社会总需求连年超过总供给、出现明显通货膨胀的情况下发生的，是靠货币信贷超投放来支撑的，有较大的隐蔽性。在商品货币关系存在的条件下，社会总产品和国民收入分解为实物运动和价值运动，通过信贷机构向社会投放超过经济增长水平的货币量，货币形式的社会总需求就会超过实物形式的社会总供给，形成通货膨胀。问题的复杂性不仅在于合理的货币流通量的界限比较模糊，银行信用创造货币供给的神奇力量也不广为人知，还由于一笔投资贷款建成的是实实在在的项目，而信贷超投放面对的是所有社会产品，由此引起的货币贬值又往往滞后发生，这就容易造成扩大投资贷款得大于失的假象。对此，我们应有清醒的认识。
    投资需求与消费需求双膨胀，并且在很大程度上是消费引导型投资扩张，这是不同于过去的一个重要特点。消费需求膨胀主要表现在，就业的扩大和居民货币收入的增长超过了社会劳动生产率的增长，社会购买力的增长超过了商品供应量的增长。过旺的消费需求和扩大就业的压力，成为导致货币信贷超投放的一大因素。这不仅推动了地方和企业千方百计扩大投资，推动了消费品加工工业的过快发展，还使能源、交通等部门生产滞后，供不应求的矛盾进一步加重，从而使投资结构的调整任务变得更为艰巨。由于消费需求具有刚性，控制消费需求增长有较大的困难，因而首先压缩投资需求，对于压缩社会总需求、抑制通货膨胀、稳定经济全局有着特别重要的意义。
    投资总量调节，核心是严格控制信贷投放总规模，投资增长要与经济增长相适应，在建投资总规模与年度投资规模要同时控制。
    投资总量调节，核心是坚持国民经济综合平衡原则，按照治理经济环境的总要求，根据国力所能承担的可能，确定投资增长速度和投资规模。首先，经济发展要稳定，不可过热，投资增长要与经济增长相适应。经济稳定发展，投资增长速度和总规模才能够稳定发展。当前的问题，就发生在经济增长过热上。过热的经济发展，必然要求扩大投资规模给予支持。因此，在国民经济稳定发展基础上实现的社会产品和国民收入，要先安排生活、生产，后安排投资，并且基本保持前后年度三者比例相对稳定。这样就可以做到投资增长与经济增长基本一致。实践证明，在我国供给短缺的情况下，通过多发票子搞建设，结果必然导致通货膨胀，影响改革与发展的进程。
    其次，财政、信贷、物资、外汇要综合平衡，这是总量平衡的关键所在。财政、信贷是国家参与社会产品和国民收入分配与再分配的重要形式，虽然它只是社会资金的一部分，但在国民经济综合平衡中有着极其重要的作用。社会总需求超过总供给，不管有多少种类型，都要通过财政赤字、信贷差额反映出来，而且最终要通过货币超经济发行才能变为现实。1979年以来，财政多年向银行透支，银行信贷投放已经大大超过经济需要量，在这种情况下控制投资总量，一定要实行财政、银行双紧政策。目前我国的财政赤字是已经计入国内外债务收入后的赤字，是硬赤字，要引起重视，着力研究财政通过增收节支实现自求平衡并略有结余的途径。银行要严格控制信贷投放总规模，要把投资信贷压到银行资金来源能够承担的范围之内，并对投资贷款实行指令性计划管理，禁止非银行金融机构从事投资信贷活动，坚决限制通过社会集资扩大投资规模。银行是控制社会总需求的总闸门，要进一步发挥银行在调节投资需求方面的作用。
    第三，在建投资总规模与年度投资规模要同时控制。年度投资规模是国家在一个年度内实际完成的固定资产投资额，它反映国家在一年之中用于固定资产再生产的人力、物力、财力的数量；在建投资总规模指当年施工的建设项目全部建成需要的投资总额。如果在建投资总规模过大，铺开的建设项目过多，势必是投资“撒胡椒面”，大量资金分散并长期占压在未完工程上，不能及时竣工投产和形成综合生产能力，严重时不得不进行在建项目清理和调整，对国民经济造成的损失浪费更大。我国目前不仅年度投资规模偏大，而且在建投资总规模也过大。解决途径主要是做好国民经济中长期发展规划，根据一个时期可能达到的逐年年度投资规模和合理的项目建设周期，测算科学的在建投资总规模，并通过建立严格的项目审批制度，正确处理新上项目和续建项目的关系，确实把在建投资总规模控制在合理的范围之内。
    第四，建立企业流动资金补充制度。目前我国企业自有资金大量涌向投资领域，流动资金基本仰靠银行贷款，加大了银行流动资金贷款需求。流动资金投资与固定资产投资同是实现投资周转不可分割的组成部分。要逐步改变一般“投资”不包括流动资金投资的观念，明确规定：（一）今后谁安排固定资产投资谁负责相应配套的铺底流动资金供应；（二）企业自有资金要首先补充企业流动资金，没有相应配套的流动资金来源的自筹建设项目不许开工建设。这样，就可以从资金分流上减少对固定资产投资的需求，压缩投资规模。
    第五，完善利率机制。当前，应较大幅度地提高利率总水平，特别要提高投资贷款利率，同时应尽快改“税前还贷”为税后还贷，硬化企业预算约束机制，抑制企业挖财政、争贷款以自肥的扩张欲望，为发挥信贷和利率的积极作用创造基础条件。
    还有一个值得注意的问题是，随着投资资金来源的增多，出现了不少“拼盘”项目，名义上是各家分摊投资，实际上其他几家往往不完全落实，只有银行贷款一家落实。结果，项目
  “骑虎难下”，迫使银行继续增加贷款。因此，减少投资贷款对于控制投资规模具有多倍收缩的作用。
    调整投资结构，关键是要解决基础工业产品价格过低问题。近期主要是调整国民收入分配，制订与国家产业政策相配套的财政、金融政策，改革投资体制，探索存量调整的新路子。
    目前我国投资结构突出的问题是能源、交通等基础产业投资严重滞后，影响了经济的协调发展。要改变这种状况，关键是要解决基础工业产品价格过低问题。
    近期要调整国民收入分配，制定与国家产业政策相配套的财政、金融政策。近几年预算内投资只占全部投资的百分之十几，无力对投资结构进行有效的调节。适当集中资金，提高中央财政收入占国民收入的比重，从而提高财政对基础产业的投资比重，在一个较长时期内都有着极其重要的意义。在价格改革困难较大的情况下，税收在抑制加工工业发展、增加财政收入和重点建设投资方面具有直接作用，宜较大幅度地提高国家限制发展产业的税率，开设预算外资金调节税、稀缺资源税、投资方向调节税等。同时应明确，国家征集的能源交通重点建设基金、发行的重点建设债券收入等，要专立帐户，集中用于重点建设投资。金融方面，在坚决贯彻执行国家产业政策的基础上，一要实行向基础产业倾斜的信贷政策，适当增加重点建设贷款基金和信贷资金来源；二要实行真正能够抑制长线、扶持基础产业发展的差别利率，并相应建立财政贴息制度。
    其次，改革投资体制，引导预算外资金用于基础产业投资。目前预算外资金大量涌向加工工业，既减少了基础产业投资来源，又加剧了基础产业供给紧缺的矛盾。我们应抓紧投资体制的配套改革，在目前财权下放的同时，相应把部分基础产业投资的任务也交给地方和企业。这样，既能够减轻国家压力，又能够有效地引导地方、企业的预算外资金用于基础产业投资，从供给与需求两个方面促进投资结构向合理化方向调整。
    再次，投资结构存量调整与增量调整并重，探索投资结构调整新路子。投资结构增量调整是指新增投资分配上向基础产业倾斜，存量调整是指通过对已有生产要素的重新组合使产业结构沿合理化方向发展。存量调整方面，目前可行的主要措施：一是有计划地支持一部分长线企业转产和推行企业兼并制度，最大限度地发挥现有生产设备的能力，提高效益，增加市场短缺产品的供给；二是建立健全闲置设备与剩余物资交易和租赁市场，通过现有生产要素的流动优化资产配置；三是有选择地拍卖一些国营小型企业，出售一批公有住房，在法律许可的范围内向外商有偿转让少量土地使用权，从而集中和筹措一大笔资金，重点用于基础产业的投入。
