Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 29th.

Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, Ren Zhonglin, reported on the situation regarding the rectification and reorganization of companies at the ninth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress today. He said that by the end of June this year, the self-inspection and key sampling inspections of various types of companies nationwide had basically been completed, covering approximately 47% of the total number of companies. The rectification and reorganization of companies has now entered the stage of handling and organizational construction.

Ren Zhonglin said that companies confirmed to be retained after rectification would be strictly reviewed and re-registered by the industrial and commercial administrative authorities in conjunction with annual inspections.

He pointed out that the preliminary stage of self-inspection and key sampling inspections had achieved initial results:

(1) The problem of party and government agencies engaging in business and running enterprises has been basically rectified and stopped. By the end of June this year, a total of 17,930 companies run by party and government agencies at all levels nationwide had been either closed, merged, or financially decoupled from the agencies, accounting for 90.5% of the total number of companies run by party and government agencies. Additionally, 3,044 out of 4,104 companies run by various mass organizations and social groups had been either closed, merged, or financially decoupled, accounting for 74.2% of such companies. Those that have not yet been closed, merged, or financially decoupled are still under rectification.

(2) The problem of party and government officials and retired cadres holding concurrent positions in companies has been basically resolved. Before the rectification, there were 47,956 officials and retired cadres from county-level and above party and government agencies holding concurrent positions in companies (enterprises) nationwide. By the end of June this year, according to the relevant regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council, 42,952 party and government officials and retired cadres had resigned from their positions in companies or agencies, accounting for 89.6% of the total number of officials holding concurrent positions. Among them, the majority resigned from their company positions, while a minority resigned from their agency positions or had their agency benefits suspended. For those who have not yet resigned from their "dual positions," some are due to the slow processing of procedures, while others need to continue serving because of enterprise contract terms or Sino-foreign joint venture employment contracts that have not yet expired. Some are also required to stay on because they are the legal representatives of enterprises, and debt issues have not been resolved.

(3) The problem of some companies having unclear separation of government and enterprise functions has been resolved to some extent. By the end of June this year, 4,884 companies nationwide with unclear separation of government and enterprise functions had been resolved, accounting for 45.9% of such companies. Among them, 1,255 were either closed or suspended, 2,730 had their government administrative functions returned, and 899 no longer engaged in business operations. The problem of some companies directly affiliated with central state agencies having unclear separation of government and enterprise functions is being resolved through the implementation of departmental organizational reform plans. For a few companies that have both government administrative functions, relevant departments are reviewing and determining their functions and business scope and clarifying them according to the regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council.

(4) A number of companies' disciplinary and legal violations have been investigated and dealt with. By the end of June this year, 25,884 cases of disciplinary and legal violations involving various types of companies had been discovered nationwide, affecting 25,404 companies. Of these, 12,750 cases had been filed for investigation, and 10,303 cases had been closed, with a closure rate of 80.8%. During the investigation, 9,534 companies were fined, with a total of over 260 million yuan in fines and confiscated property. The business licenses of 2,871 companies were revoked. Due to embezzlement, bribery, dereliction of duty, and other disciplinary and legal violations, 476 officials received party and government disciplinary actions, and 301 officials received criminal penalties. The State Council's Office for Tax, Finance, and Price Inspection, in conjunction with relevant departments, conducted key inspections of 100 nationally significant companies affiliated with various departments of the central state agencies, uncovering various disciplinary and legal violations totaling over 1.13 billion yuan, including over 730 million yuan in unpaid disciplinary fines, of which 450 million yuan had been paid.

(5) A number of companies have been closed, merged, or transformed. By the end of June this year, 36,782 companies nationwide had been either closed, merged, or transformed into other types of enterprises that did not meet the conditions for being a company, accounting for 12.5% of the total number of companies. Hebei Province has currently closed, merged, or transformed 3,246 companies, accounting for 23.5% of its total number of companies. In central state agencies, according to the arrangements of the Chemical Industry, Construction, Transportation, and Pharmaceutical departments, the number of companies to be closed or merged accounts for 31% of their total number of affiliated companies. The Light Industry Department has 194 affiliated companies, and after rectification and reorganization, it was decided to close or merge 5 first-level companies and 48 second-level companies. The Ministry of Communications has decided to close or merge 47 companies, including the China Water Transport Engineering Consulting Company.

(6) Several policy regulations have been formulated. During the rectification and reorganization of companies, the Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant departments have formulated several policy regulations based on actual situations. These include the State Council's "Notice on Rectifying and Organizing Various Types of Foreign Economic and Trade Companies," the General Office of the Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council's "Notice on Several Issues Regarding Party and State Cadres Holding Concurrent Positions in Companies (Enterprises)," "Several Regulations on the Problem of Retired (Separated) Cadres from County-Level and Above Party and State Agencies Engaging in Business and Running Enterprises," the State Council's approval of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's "Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Annual Inspection and Re-registration of Companies," the Ministry of Finance's "Regulations on the Rectification and Organization of Company Finances," and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Audit Office's "Notice on Verifying the Registered Capital of Companies During the Rectification and Organization Process," among others.

(7) Audits have been conducted on five companies, including Kanghua and Zhongxin, and their illegal activities have been dealt with. According to the instructions of the State Council, the National Audit Office began auditing the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, Guangda Industrial Company, China Kanghua Development Corporation, China Industrial and Commercial Economic Development Corporation, and China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation in late October last year. The audit results showed that these five companies, since their establishment, have generally developed rapidly in utilizing foreign capital, introducing technology and equipment, engaging in foreign trade, and developing the economy, to varying degrees, playing a positive role. However, many illegal business activities were also discovered. According to relevant regulations, decisions have been made to confiscate illegal gains, impose fines, and supplement taxes totaling 51.33 million yuan. The responsible persons for illegal and disciplinary violations are being dealt with by relevant departments.

Ren Zhonglin said that recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have decided to dissolve the Kanghua Development Corporation and the China Industrial and Commercial Economic Development Corporation and to merge the China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation into the State Agricultural Investment Corporation. Work teams have been dispatched to assist the two companies in handling post-liquidation matters. Both companies have established liquidation committees to handle the clearance of assets and debts. For the contracts signed by the companies, both domestic and foreign, arrangements have been made for relevant units to continue their implementation.

He said that since last October, various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and central departments have done a lot of work in rectifying and organizing companies and have achieved initial results. However, due to an underestimation of the complexity and difficulty of rectifying and organizing companies, the previous measures were not specific and forceful enough. Additionally, the disturbances and counter-revolutionary riots have interfered with the rectification and organization work, which has not yet achieved the expected results. The current problems in the work include: some localities and departments lack the resolve to close or merge companies, hesitate, and act slowly; some departments and localities do not pay enough attention to investigating and dealing with company violations; and some policy issues in the work have not been promptly addressed, affecting the implementation of the closure and merger plans.

Ren Zhonglin pointed out that recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have made a decision on several matters of concern to the people in the near future, with the first being the further rectification and organization of companies. To grasp, do well, and do thoroughly this work, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have issued the "Decision on Further Rectifying and Organizing Companies," making new arrangements and putting forward new requirements for this work.

(1) All regions and departments must make a big decision to resolutely close or merge a batch of companies that do not meet social needs, are redundant, do not meet the conditions for establishment, have serious disciplinary and legal violations, and have been operating poorly for a long time, incurring heavy losses, and are insolvent. Most companies run by party and government agencies, mass organizations, and social groups at all levels, whether or not they have financially decoupled from the agencies and organizations, should be cut down. Excessive and rampant companies in the circulation sector that engage in commercial wholesale, foreign trade, and material supply, as well as financial companies, should also be closed. This is one of the key points and basic requirements for further rectifying and organizing companies in the future. All regions and departments should formulate plans to close or merge companies according to the requirements of the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. For the companies to be closed or merged, the main tasks are: first, the competent departments should establish liquidation organizations to handle the clearance of debts and assets and prevent the withdrawal of funds, private division of property, waste, and unnecessary economic losses to the state. Second, the contracts signed by the companies to be closed or merged, especially foreign contracts, should continue to be implemented to maintain economic order and foreign credibility and protect the legal rights of foreign investors. Third, for the personnel of the companies to be closed or merged, ideological and political work should be done, and they should be properly arranged and placed. The task of closing or merging companies should be basically completed by the end of this year. For the companies after closure or merger, the original industrial and commercial administrative authorities should handle the cancellation or alteration procedures.

(2) Seriously investigate and deal with company disciplinary and legal violations, especially major cases involving party and government agencies, leading cadres, and their direct relatives using their power for personal gain, participating in the illegal trading of important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods. Adhere to the principle of facts as the basis and law as the criterion, investigate whichever company has problems and whoever has problems, and treat everyone equally before the law. All violations of state laws and regulations should be investigated to the end and dealt with according to law. Companies with illegal and disciplinary violations, if they actively self-inspect and report within the time limit specified by the state judicial authorities, and those who commit embezzlement, bribery, and speculation and profiteering within the specified time limit, can be treated leniently, reduced in punishment, or exempted from punishment according to law; otherwise, they will be severely punished according to law. During the investigation and handling of illegal and disciplinary cases, relevant departments should strengthen their coordination. For the legal representatives of companies with illegal and disciplinary violations and the responsible persons involved in the cases, those who violate party and government disciplines should be given party and government disciplinary actions; those who violate criminal laws should be held criminally responsible. For cases with strong resistance and strong public reaction, higher-level authorities should dispatch work teams for a thorough investigation. Those who interfere with the case handling process, show favoritism, and protect wrongdoers should be publicly exposed and severely dealt with. The public should be mobilized to report, and the handling results of some typical cases should also be promptly made public.

(3) Improve systems, strengthen management, perfect regulations, and ensure the healthy development of companies. For the companies that need to be retained after this rectification, the industrial and commercial administrative authorities at all levels should conduct annual inspections and re-registration according to law and strictly determine the business scope and business methods; for companies named as state-owned or collective but actually privately invested, they should be carefully inspected, and the nature of ownership should be strictly distinguished; those that do not meet the regulations should not be registered or issued new licenses. The State Council has instructed relevant departments to quickly formulate necessary regulations on the financial, personnel, salary, bonus, and welfare issues of companies. The industrial and commercial administrative, financial, tax, banking, price, audit, and supervision departments should strengthen the management, guidance, supervision, and inspection of various types of companies. During the rectification and organization of companies, except for production-type and technology development-type companies, the approval of establishing new companies should continue to be suspended. In the future, the establishment of new companies, especially companies engaged in commerce, foreign trade, material supply, and financial services, must be approved according to law and strictly controlled. Regarding the legislative issues of companies, the State Council attaches great importance to them, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is also very concerned. Currently, relevant departments are drafting and perfecting relevant company regulations according to the instructions of the State Council and will soon issue company management regulations to gradually realize the standardization and institutionalization of company approval and management work.

(4) Strengthen organizational leadership. Whether the work of further rectifying and organizing companies can achieve the expected results depends on leadership. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have established the National Leading Group for Rectifying and Organizing Companies. All localities and departments should correspondingly strengthen their leading and working organizations, raise awareness, unify thinking, eliminate interference, and grasp the formulation, approval, and implementation of the plans for closing or merging companies. For regions and departments with slow progress, strengthen supervision and inspection. For companies that have already been confirmed to be retained, including those that have completed annual inspections and re-registration, a comprehensive review should be conducted to complete the task of further rectifying and organizing companies. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council require central state agencies to take the lead and set an example. All regions and departments should implement the system of provincial governors (chairmen of autonomous regions, mayors of municipalities directly under the Central Government) and ministers of departments being responsible.

    国家工商局局长任中林向人大常委会汇报情况
    各类公司自查重点抽查获初步成效
    清理整顿转入处理和组织建设阶段
    新华社北京八月二十九日电  国家工商行政管理局局长任中林在今天举行的七届全国人大常委会第九次会议上汇报清理整顿公司情况时说，到今年六月底，全国各类公司的自查和重点抽查工作已基本结束，抽查面约占公司总数的百分之四十七，清理整顿公司工作已转入处理和组织建设阶段。
    任中林说，经整顿确定保留的公司，由工商行政管理机关结合年检严格审查，重新登记注册。
    他指出，经过前一阶段的自查和重点抽查工作，取得了初步成效：
    （一）党政机关经商办企业的问题基本上得到清理和制止。到今年六月底，全国各级党政机关开办的公司已撤销、合并六千四百八十一户，与党政机关财务脱钩一万零三百八十六户，移交有关部门一千零六十三户，三项合计一万七千九百三十户，占党政机关办公司总数户的百分之九十点五。此外，全国各类群众组织和社会团体经商开办的四千一百零四户公司，已撤并或脱钩三千零四十四户，占这类公司的百分之七十四点二。现在尚未撤并、脱钩的，正在继续清理。
    （二）党政机关干部和离退休干部在公司兼职任职问题基本解决。在清理整顿前，全国县以上党政机关共有四万七千九百五十六名在职干部和离退休干部在公司（企业）兼职任职。到今年六月底，按照中央和国务院的有关规定，已有四万二千九百五十二名党政机关在职干部和离退休干部辞去公司或机关职务，占兼职任职干部总数的百分之八十九点六。其中大多数辞去公司职务，少数辞去机关职务或中止机关生活待遇。在尚未辞去“一头职务”的兼职任职干部中，除一部分是办理手续工作抓得不紧外，有的因为企业承包合同或中外合资企业聘任合同期限未到，需要继续留任；有的因为是企业的法定代表人，债权债务问题没有处理完，需要有个过程。
    （三）一部分公司政企不分的问题得到解决。到今年六月底，全国政企不分的公司已解决四千八百八十四户，占这类公司的百分之四十五点九。其中：撤销或停办的一千二百五十五户，收回政府行政管理职能的二千七百三十户，不再从事经营的八百九十九户。中央国家机关一些直属公司政企不分的问题，通过各部门机构改革方案的落实，正在解决。对少数兼有政府行政管理职能的公司，有关部门正在对其职能和经营范围进行审查、核定，并分别按中央和国务院的规定予以明确。
    （四）查处了一批公司违纪违法案件。到今年6月底，全国已查出各类公司违纪违法案件25884件，涉及25404户公司，已立案查处12750件，结案10303件，结案率80.8％。在查处中，有9534户公司受到经济处罚，收缴罚没款共计2.6亿多元，有2871户公司被吊销营业执照；因贪污、受贿、渎职等违纪违法问题，受到党纪、政纪处分的干部有476人，受到刑事处罚的干部有301人。国务院税收财务物价大检查办公室会同有关部门，对中央国家机关各部门所属的100户全国性公司进行了重点检查，查出各种违纪违法金额11.3亿多元，其中应交违纪金额7.3亿多元，已补交入库金额4.5亿多元。
    （五）撤并改了一批公司。到今年6月底，各地公司已撤销的22810户，已合并的1652户，不具备公司条件改办其他企业的12320户，三项合计36782户，占公司总数的12.5％。河北省目前已撤并改了3246户公司，占其公司总数的23.5％。在中央国家机关，据化工、建设、交通、医药4个部门的安排，已确定撤并的公司占其所属公司总数的31％。轻工部所属的公司共有194户，经清理整顿，决定撤并一级公司5户，二级公司48户。交通部已确定撤并中国水运工程咨询公司等47户公司。
    （六）制定了一些政策性规定。在清理整顿公司工作中，中央、国务院及有关部门从实际情况出发，陆续制定了一些政策性规定。包括国务院《关于清理整顿各类对外经济贸易公司的通知》，中央办公厅、国务院办公厅《关于清理党和国家机关干部在公司（企业）兼职有关问题的通知》、《关于县以上党和国家机关退（离）休干部经商办企业问题的若干规定》，国务院批转国家工商行政管理局《关于公司年检和重新登记注册若干问题意见的通知》，财政部《清理整顿公司财务的规定》，国家工商行政管理局、财政部、审计署《关于在清理整顿公司中对公司注册资金进行验证的通知》等等。
    （七）审计了康华、中信等5个公司，对它们的违法行为进行了处理。根据国务院的指示，审计署从去年10月下旬开始，陆续对中国国际信托投资公司、光大实业公司、中国康华发展总公司、中国工商经济开发总公司、中国农村信托投资公司进行了审计。审计的结果表明，这5个公司成立以来，大多业务发展较快，在利用外资、引进技术设备、对外贸易、发展经济等方面，程度不同地起了积极作用。但也查出这些公司不少违法经营问题，依照有关法规已作出处理决定，对5个公司共没收非法所得、处以罚款和补交税金5133万元。违法违纪问题的责任人员，有关部门正在处理中。
    任中林说，最近，党中央、国务院做出决定，撤销康华发展总公司和中国工商经济开发公司，将中国农村信托投资公司并入国家农业投资公司。对康华、工商两公司已派出工作组，协助公司处理好善后事宜。两公司分别成立了清算委员会，负责资产和债权债务的清理工作，对公司已签定的对内对外的合同，组织有关单位继续执行。
    他说，自去年10月以来，各省、自治区、直辖市和中央各部门在清理整顿公司方面，做了不少工作，取得初步的成绩。但是由于我们对清理整顿公司的复杂性、艰巨性估计不足，前一段的措施不够具体有力，再加上动乱和反革命暴乱的干扰，清理整顿工作还远没有取得预期的效果。当前工作中存在的问题，一是不少地方和部门对撤并公司决心不大，犹豫观望，行动迟缓。二是有的部门和地方对公司违法案件抓得不紧，查处不力。三是对工作中的一些政策性问题没有及时做出具体规定，影响了撤并方案的实施。
    任中林指出，最近，中共中央、国务院作出了关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定，其中第一件事就是进一步清理整顿公司。为了把这项工作抓紧、抓好、抓到底，中共中央、国务院已发布了《关于进一步清理整顿公司的决定》，对这项工作作出新的部署，提出了新的要求。
    （一）各地区、各部门必须下大决心，坚决撤并一批不符合社会需要、重复设置、不具备开办条件、严重违法乱纪的公司，以及长期经营不善、严重亏损、资不抵债的公司。各级党政机关、群众组织、社会团体开办的公司，无论在财务上是否与机关、团体脱钩，绝大部分应当砍掉。流通领域中过多、过滥的从事商业批发、对外贸易、物资供应的公司和金融性公司也要撤销。这是今后进一步清理整顿公司的工作重点和基本要求之一。各地区、各部门应当按照中共中央、国务院决定的要求制定撤并公司的方案。对于撤并的公司，主要需做好三件事：一是由主管部门成立清算组织，负责清理债权债务和资产关系，严格防止抽走资金、私分财产、挥霍浪费，避免国家在经济上受到不必要的损失。二是撤并公司原已签订的合同特别是涉外合同，要继续履行，以维护经济秩序和对外信誉，保障外商的合法权益。三是对撤并公司的人员要做好思想政治工作，统筹安排，妥善安置。今年年底以前必须基本完成公司的撤并任务。对撤并后的公司，应到原登记注册的工商行政管理局办理注销手续或变更手续。
    （二）认真查处公司违纪违法案件，特别是涉及党政机关、领导干部及其直系亲属以权谋私，参与倒卖重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品的大案要案。坚持以事实为根据，以法律为准绳的原则，哪个公司有问题清查哪个公司，谁有问题清查谁，在法律面前一律平等。凡违反国家法律、法规的，都要一查到底，依法处理。有违法乱纪行为的公司，如果能在国家司法机关规定的期限内积极自查自报，犯有贪污、受贿、投机倒把行为的人，能在规定的期限内坦白自首、积极退赃，依法可以从轻、减轻或免予处罚，否则，依法从严惩处。在查处违法违纪案件时，要加强有关部门的配合。对违法乱纪公司的法定代表人及案件有关责任人，违反党纪政纪的，给予党纪、政纪处分；触犯刑律的，追究刑事责任。对于查处阻力大，群众反映强烈的案件，上级机关派出工作组，彻底清查。对办案过程中说情袒护、徇私包庇者，要公开揭露，严肃处理。要发动群众举报，一些典型案件的查处结果，也应当及时公布于众。
    （三）健全制度，加强管理，完善法规，保证公司的健康发展。对这次整顿后需要保留的公司，各级工商行政管理机关要依法进行年检和重新登记注册，并从严核定经营范围和经营方式；对以国营、集体公司为名的私人投资企业，要认真清理，严格划分所有制性质；不符合规定的，一律不予登记换照。国务院已责成有关部门尽快就公司的财务、人事、工资、奖金、福利等问题，制定必要的规章制度。工商行政管理、财政、税务、银行、物价、审计、监察等部门要切实加强对各类公司的管理、指导、监督和检查。在清理整顿公司期间，除生产型、科技开发型公司外，继续暂停审批成立新的公司。今后成立新的公司，特别是成立从事商业、外贸、物资供应公司和金融性公司，必须依法审批，从严掌握。关于公司的立法问题，国务院十分重视，人大常委会也是非常关注的。目前，有关部门正按照国务院的指示，抓紧制定和完善有关公司的法规，尽快起草和颁发公司管理方面的条例，逐步实现公司审批、管理工作的规范化、制度化。
    （四）切实加强组织领导。进一步清理整顿公司工作能否达到预期的效果，领导是关键。党中央、国务院已成立全国清理整顿公司领导小组，各地方、各部门也要相应地充实加强领导机构和办事机构，提高认识，统一思想，排除干扰，抓好公司撤并留方案的制定、审批和实施工作，对进展缓慢的地区、部门加强督促检查，对原已确定保留的公司，包括
  已办理年检和重新登记注册的公司，要逐个进行复查，认真完成进一步清理整顿公司的任务。中共中央和国务院要求中央国家机关要带好头，作出表率。各地区、各部门实行各省省长（自治区主席、直辖市市长）和各部部长负责制。
