Let us think calmly – speaking from the heart in the new semester
		Qinghua University Radio Engineering Department Student Liu Yue

		It has been more than two months since the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing was suppressed. This riot caused enormous damage to our already impoverished country. In the process of the turmoil evolving from a student movement to social unrest and finally to a counter-revolutionary riot, the instigators and planners cleverly pushed some students, who thought their motives were pure, to the forefront, making the students unwittingly play a role in aiding the wicked. This bitter lesson must be seriously heeded by us students.

		When the turmoil first began in the peaceful Qinghua Garden, as a second-year student, I was deeply pondering and carefully observing everything that was happening. I was puzzled by the government's dialogue with the students while the turmoil continued to escalate, I was indignant at the wanton insults to human dignity and slanders against the Party and the government, and I was confused by the contradictory statements of some leaders. Later, through newspapers and television, I learned a lot of things I had not known before. Recently, after talking with some classmates, we all felt like we had woken up from a bad dream. To ensure that such tragic events do not happen again on campus, I believe we students should learn lessons from various aspects, but the most urgent and important ones are the following three points:

		First, we must establish a clear legal consciousness.
		I often hear classmates saying, "The law in China is not well-established." This is true, and for this reason, we have been emphasizing legal construction and improving citizens' legal consciousness for years. Unfortunately, this riot started precisely from violating the law. At the beginning of the turmoil, large and small, colorful big-character posters appeared in front of the ten cafeterias in Qinghua. Some of these posters demanded that China must follow the path of the law. This viewpoint itself is indeed beyond reproach and very popular, aligning with the government's efforts. However, our government has clear regulations against the "four bigs," and opinions can be reflected through organizational channels. As the situation developed, I noticed that some big-character posters even slandered and personally attacked Party and state leaders, openly directing their arrows at the Communist Party of China. At such a critical moment, I observed that many classmates did not think much of it, and some even relished it. This deviated even further from the path of the rule of law. But the matter did not end there. Illegal actions gave birth to illegal organizations. The "High Autonomous Federation" from the beginning vigorously promoted the idea that the constitution guarantees citizens the freedom to march and demonstrate, claiming that Beijing's ten regulations on marches and demonstrations are unconstitutional, attempting to cloak their illegal actions in a legal guise. Due to weak legal consciousness, many students easily believed these propaganda points, disregarding Beijing's regulations on marches and demonstrations, and illegally took to the streets. The government kindly advised that this would disrupt Beijing's normal traffic and interfere with the lives of citizens. In my opinion, classmates should have considered the losses this would bring to Beijing at that time. But then, larger-scale marches and petitions followed, with many students not considering the consequences and participating blindly. I remember that at that time, in a large dormitory building, only a few students were left. Later, when the hunger strike began, Beijing's traffic was in chaos. On May 18th, I rode my bike into the city and saw that from Fuxingmen to Dongdan, the streets were filled with blocked vehicles. However, many students never realized that their actions were illegal. And those who did realize it often used "patriotism is not a crime" to justify themselves. All this does not show that classmates' legal consciousness is weak?

		Because they did not want to know what is illegal and what is not, they acted rashly out of passion and hot-headedness, doing things that are heartbreaking. I believe that in this moment of reflection, strengthening legal consciousness is a lesson we should learn. Without this, it is difficult to prevent out-of-bounds behavior.

		Second, we must establish a necessary sense of enemy and friend.
		There is no doubt that large-scale class struggles have ended in our country, and we cannot continue with the line of class struggle. However, our Party has also clearly pointed out that not engaging in class struggle does not mean that class struggle no longer exists; on the contrary, at certain times and in certain places, class struggle can still be very intense. This counter-revolutionary riot proves the correctness of this statement.

		However, from April to June this year, how many of these kind-hearted students considered this issue? How many people thought that Beijing would have arsonists and thugs who would attack the extremely restrained soldiers of the People's Liberation Army? I remember that at that time, a big-character poster appeared in Qinghua, exposing someone who deliberately incited students to storm Zhongnanhai to create a conflict between the police and students, and spread rumors to escalate the situation. But soon, insulting words were written on this big-character poster. Yet, classmates did not express any disagreement with this extremely undemocratic and tyrannical behavior, reflecting how extreme the emotions of most students had become at that time. They subjectively viewed issues, attributing their own intentions to others, believing that every student had "a pure heart and patriotic feelings," and they did not want to hear or see anything that would harm the image of their so-called "student leaders" in their minds. This hindered their ability to calmly judge the nature of the situation.

		Even worse, the illegal organization's broadcasting station in the school, while loudly advocating, "We must think rationally and calmly about the problem!" also emphasized, "We must unconditionally obey the command of the High Autonomous Federation!" Emphasizing rationality and calling for blind obedience, these two completely incompatible concepts were placed side by side, which was a great contradiction, yet few people noticed this. It was precisely because students' sense of enemy and friend was weak, and they did not realize that there were all kinds of people among the students, that they unconsciously accepted the erroneous syllogism of "I am a student," "My motives are pure," "Therefore, all students' motives are pure," and based on this, they blindly followed those with ulterior motives, without asking for reasons, without considering the consequences, and acted rashly, mixing good and bad people together, bringing great difficulties to stopping the turmoil and suppressing the riot, and causing the people to suffer immense losses. The lesson is very profound.

		Society is complex; it is not like the physics and mathematics we study, which can be summarized with simple formulas and theorems. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out that the wishes of the vast majority of students are good. But this does not mean that everyone is the same. Domestic and foreign reactionary political forces are not willing to withdraw from Chinese soil, and they will take the opportunity to stir up trouble. Students should learn from this incident, get rid of childish thinking, establish a necessary sense of enemy and friend, and prevent being used by bad people.

		Third, we must remember the four cardinal principles.
		Reform and opening up have allowed students to learn about some foreign situations, and at the same time, they will unconsciously compare foreign countries with China. At this time, they are surprised to find that China lags behind foreign countries in many aspects of material civilization. They do not understand that this gap is a historical result of imperialism and feudalism's exploitation and oppression. They sigh, they worry, and hope that our country can catch up quickly. This wish cannot be said to be bad. However, some people use students' pure feelings to propagate that socialism is not as good as capitalism, and to develop the economy, one must also learn from capitalism politically, to "Westernize completely." These bourgeois liberalization theories have indeed confused many people for a period of time. I agree with the view that China's national conditions determine that China must be led by the Communist Party of China and can only take the socialist path. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of our country, and we must never deviate from them at any time. However, this view often becomes the target of criticism.

		Some students, due to a lack of dialectical thinking, find the theories that denigrate the Communist Party and socialism very appealing. Thus, a strange phenomenon appeared on campus: the more someone denigrates the Communist Party, the more they seem to be genuinely concerned for the country. What results did deviating from the four cardinal principles bring? This time, the turmoil has shown the consequences. During the turmoil, someone proposed establishing an opposition party and copying the parliamentary system of the West. Many students thought this was the magic pill to get rid of backwardness. Later, an article titled "Declaration of Private Ownership" appeared on campus, attributing all the corrupt phenomena in society to the public ownership system, and calling to "ring the death knell of public ownership as soon as possible," which surprisingly received the approval of many students.

		Wrong thinking leads to wrong actions. When someone held up slogans like "Overthrow the fake government" and "Overthrow the authoritarian party" and marched on the streets, many students ignored the government's advice and joined the march. In the end, some students completely lost the concept of national interests, viewing the Party and government that nurtured them as enemies, smashing military vehicles, setting up barricades, and doing things that caused pain to their loved ones and joy to their enemies. Many people regarded the malicious support of foreigners as a treasure, and some even lost their national dignity and became tools of foreign reactionary forces. If our country abandons the four cardinal principles, our entire country and nation will become appendages of foreign countries, is this not clear?

		The facts have proven: our good wishes to revitalize the country and our sense of responsibility to care for the country, if separated from the four cardinal principles, will definitely lead us to the opposite of our wishes. I believe this is another lesson that students should learn.

		Turmoil and riots are very bad things, but if we can learn from them, we will gain many beneficial things. If students can reflect seriously, they will definitely gain more than the three points mentioned above. Let us summarize the experience and lessons of this counter-revolutionary riot together and turn it into a precious asset for us.

    同学们，让我们冷静想一想
    ——新学期讲讲心里话
    清华大学无线电系学生  刘越
    平息发生在北京的反革命暴乱已经两个多月，这场暴乱给我们这个本来就不富裕的国家造成了巨大的损失。在从学潮发展成社会动乱、发展成最后的反革命暴乱的过程中，动乱的煽动、策划者们巧妙地把一些自以为动机是善良的大学生推上第一线，使大学生们自觉不自觉地起了助纣为虐的作用。这个惨痛教训，我们大学生确实要认真记取。
    当平静的清华园学潮初起时，作为一个二年级学生，我就在苦苦地思索、认真地观察当时发生的一切。我对政府已经开始了对话但学潮仍不断升级而感到迷惑，对肆意侮辱人格、诋毁党和政府的做法感到气愤，对某些领导人前后矛盾的说法感到费解。后来，通过报纸和电视，了解到很多以前不知道的情况。最近和一些同学交谈，大家普遍有从恶梦中醒来之感。为了使今后不再在校园中出现亲者痛、仇者快的事情，我觉得我们大学生们应该吸取多方面的教训，但最迫切、最主要的应是以下三点：
    一、要树立明确的法律观念
    常听到同学中有这样的议论：“中国的法律太不健全了。”这不错，正因为如此，近些年我们一直很重视法制建设，注意提高公民的法律观念。遗憾的是，这次暴乱，恰恰是从违背法律开始的。学潮伊始，清华十食堂前就出现了大大小小、花花绿绿的大字报，其中有的大字报提出必须使中国走上法律的轨道。这一观点本身的确无可非议，并且是颇得民心，与政府的努力方向是一致的。但是我们的政府已有明文规定取消“四大”，有意见可以通过组织渠道反映。随着事态的发展，我发现有的大字报居然对党和国家领导人肆意谩骂和进行人身攻击，并公然把矛头指向中国共产党。在事态如此严重的时刻，我观察到很多同学对此不以为然，个别人甚至津津乐道。这就背离法治的轨道走得更远了。但事情并未就此结束，非法的行为又产生了非法的组织。“高自联”从一开始就大力宣传宪法规定公民有游行、示威的自由，说什么北京市对游行示威的十条规定是违背宪法的，企图给他们的非法行动披上一件合法的外衣。由于法律观念薄弱，许多同学轻信了这些宣传，以至于不顾北京市关于游行示威的规定，非法上街游行。政府好言相劝，说这样搞影响了北京市的正常交通，妨碍了市民的正常生活。按我的想法，同学们这时应该考虑一下这会给北京市带来怎样的损失。但接着发生了更大规模的游行请愿，很多学生不考虑后果，盲目参加，我记得当时诺大的一座宿舍楼，所剩学生寥寥无几。到后来绝食时，北京的交通已是一片混乱。5月18日，我骑车进城，看到从复兴门到东单，马路上都是被阻住的车辆。但是很多大学生始终未能意识到自己的这些行为是违法的。而那些意识到这一点的人，也多用“爱国无罪”为自己开脱。这一切，不正说明同学们的法律观念不强吗？
    由于不愿意了解什么是违法、什么是不违法，只凭热情，头脑发热时便干出了令人痛心的事。我觉得在痛定思痛之际，加强法律观念，是应该吸取的教训之一。没有这一条，言行越轨的现象是难以杜绝的。
    二、要树立必要的敌我观念
    毫无疑问，在我国，大规模的阶级斗争已经结束，我们不能再搞以阶级斗争为纲那一套了。但是我们党也明确指出，不搞以阶级斗争为纲，并不是说阶级斗争已经不复存在，恰恰相反，在某些时候，某些地方，阶级斗争还可能是很激烈的。这场反革命暴乱，说明这一论断的正确。
    但是，在今年4至6月，善良的大学生们有几个人考虑过这个问题呢？又有多少人想到过我们北京也会有杀人放火，向极度克制的解放军战士下毒手的暴徒呢？我记得清华当时出现过一张大字报，揭露有人故意煽动学生冲击新华门，以便造成警察与学生的冲突，并制造谣言，借以扩大事态的做法。但很快，这张大字报上就写上了辱骂作者的话。可是同学们对这种极不民主、极端专横的做法并未表示异议，这反映了当时大多数学生的情绪已经达到多么偏激的地步。他们主观地看问题，以己之心度人之心，认为每个学生都怀着“一颗赤子心，一片爱国情”，他们不愿意听到、看到任何有损于他们心中所谓“学生领袖”形象的话。这就妨碍了他们冷静地判断事情的性质是什么。
    更有甚者，学校里的非法组织学运筹委会的广播台一边大声呼吁：“我们要理智、冷静地思考问题！”一边强调：“我们必须无条件地服从高自联的指挥！”强调理智与叫人盲从这两个根本不相容的概念公然并列，这本身就是一个极大的矛盾，然而却很少有人察觉到这一点。正是由于大学生们敌我观念淡薄，没有意识到学生中也会有各种各样的人，所以不自觉地接受了“我是大学生”，“我的动机是纯洁的”，“因此所有大学生的动机都是纯洁的”错误三段论，并以此为根据，对那些别有用心的人言听计从，不问原因，不考虑后果，盲目行动，使好人坏人混在一起，给制止动乱、平定暴乱带来重重困难，使人民蒙受了极大的损失，教训是极为深刻的。
    社会是复杂的，它不像我们学的物理学、数学那样能用简单的公式、定理来概括。党中央再三指出，绝大多数同学的愿望是好的。但这自然不是说所有的人都是如此。国内外的反动政治势力并不甘心从中国大地上退出，他们还会趁机兴风作浪，大学生们应该从这次事件中吸取教训，摆脱幼稚的思维方式，树立必要的敌我观念，防止被坏人利用。
      三、牢记四项基本原则
      改革开放使大学生们了解了一些外国的情况，同时，也会不自觉地将外国与中国作些比较。这时，他们惊讶地发现，中国在物质文明的很多方面落后于外国。他们不了解这种差距是历史形成的，是帝国主义和封建主义剥削、压迫的结果。他们感叹，他们着急，希望我们国家能一下子赶上去。这种愿望不能说是坏的。但是，有的人利用同学们这种纯朴的感情，宣传社会主义不如资本主义，要想发展经济，政治上也得效法资本主义，要“全盘西化”。这些资产阶级自由化的论调，一个时期以来，的确迷惑了不少人。我赞同这样的观点：中国的国情决定了中国必须由中国共产党来领导，中国只能走社会主义道路。四项基本原则是我们的立国之本，任何时候都不能背离。但是这种观点却时常成为众矢之的。
    一些同学由于缺乏辩证思维的能力，对宣扬资本主义、贬低社会主义的论调听着很顺耳。于是校园里出现一种谁贬低共产党最厉害，谁似乎就最忧国忧民的怪现象。背离四项基本原则得到了什么结果呢？这次动乱中可就吃到了苦果。在动乱中有人提出要成立反对党，照搬西方的议会制度。竟然有很多同学认为这才是摆脱落后的灵丹妙药。后来在校园中出现的《私有制宣言》一文，把社会上的一切腐败现象简单地归罪于公有制，号召“早日敲响公有制的丧钟”，居然也得到很多同学的赞同。
    错误的思想导致错误的行动。当有人举着“打倒伪政府”、“打倒专制政党”等标语上街游行时，不少同学置政府的劝说于脑后，竟然也加入了游行的行列。最后，导致一些学生完全丧失了国家利益的概念，把哺育自己成人的党和政府视为敌人，砸军车、设路障，干出亲者痛、仇者快的事情。不少人对外国人别有用心的支持视为珍宝，甚至有人不惜丧失民族尊严，成为外国反动势力的工具。如果我们国家放弃了四项基本原则，我们整个国家、整个民族都会沦为外国的附庸，这不是很清楚的吗？
    事实证明：我们振兴国家的良好愿望和“忧国忧民”的责任感，如果离开了四项基本原则，就一定会走到自己愿望相反的路上去。我认为这是大学生们应该吸取的又一教训。
    动乱和暴乱是件很大的坏事，但如果能吸取教训，就会从中得到很多有益的东西。如果同学们能进行认真反思，肯定会有比上面所写的三点更多的收获。让我们来共同总结这次反革命暴乱的经验教训，把它变成我们的一笔宝贵财富。
