Currently, the number of people coming to China to study martial arts is increasing, expanding from Asia to Europe and the Americas. Countries that previously rarely sent students, such as the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, have also braved the summer heat to come to Beijing to study martial arts. To meet their needs, the State Sports Commission's Wushu Academy has organized an international wushu training class at the Beijing Wushu Training Base in Weiming Mountain Villa.

The Beijing International Wushu Training Class will begin on August 10th and last for one month. Participants include coaches from the Soviet Union, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, France, Mexico, Nepal, Hong Kong, Macao, and the United States, totaling 11 countries and regions with over 30 coaches. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria have sent leaders and coaches from their respective martial arts associations.

Renowned martial artists and coaches Cai Longyun, Wu Bin, Xu Xiangdong, Chen Guorong, and Zhang Zheng will be responsible for the training. They will primarily teach seven newly compiled wushu competition routines and some traditional wushu routines, as well as theoretical courses on Chinese wushu and health cultivation methods.
