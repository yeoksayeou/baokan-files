Over the past decade, as the economic reform has deepened, contemporary Chinese arts have been strongly impacted by the commodity economy and foreign arts, undergoing a tremendous transformation. In this arduous process of reform, what kind of arts do the people need to supplement their spirits and drive their production? I believe it should be works that can elevate the quality of the entire nation, facilitate the deepening of reforms, and promote social progress.

	1. Genuine Emotion is the Soul of Art
	Over the past ten years, the flourishing development of Chinese arts is evident to all. However, it is also undeniable that truly outstanding works are not numerous. What is the reason for this? I believe it is because contemporary artworks have lost their genuine emotion. An author's feelings, whether joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness, if not reaching the level of "burning," that is, if objective things do not resonate deeply in the author's heart and are expressed as poetry, novels, or dramas, they will not move people. Someone once said, "A talented writer writes what he can, while a great writer writes what he must." The reason he must write is that he is driven by his inner emotions, and if he does not write, his heart will not find peace. The genuine great works all express emotions that are heart-wrenching, reaching the root of life, and emanating from the depths of the soul. Why do the people prefer to watch art performances they themselves have organized? It is because these performances genuinely reflect people's joys, sorrows, anger, and happiness. Although they may not be perfect or refined, they are more attractive and full of life compared to some movies and TV dramas where actors shed tears and audiences laugh heartily. As the reform deepens, contradictions in various aspects will become more pronounced, and our steps will encounter many difficulties. False optimism will not work; sharing the people's hardships is the quality a writer should have. The sincerity and depth of emotions lie here. Writers must deeply observe and seriously contemplate the reform, expressing their ideals and aspirations for the reform, as well as their love and hatred towards life, using the magical art of language in their works. Only then can they produce works that stir the heart, inspiring people and fulfilling the historical mission of arts.

	2. Artistic Creation Should Aim to Elevate the Nation's Cultural Quality
	I deeply feel that the low cultural quality of the masses is seriously hindering the development of society and the progress of reform. During the May Fourth Movement, a group of intellectuals who shared the fate of the nation with sharp pens awakened the sleeping nation. What about today? We should see the tremendous impact of the commodity economy on people's spiritual realm and lifestyle, see how people digest and understand the various contradictions and confusions brought by the impact, and see behind the superficiality and vulgarity, people's pursuit of positive, healthy, and uplifting arts. I do not believe that there exists literature and art without purpose. Since the existence of arts, all the masterpieces have produced broad and profound social influences, been respected and loved by many readers and audiences, and thus been preserved in the history of arts. Literature and art are a true and conscious reflection and expression of historical life, real life, and the thoughts, emotions, and cultural psychology of the people in the process of life. Therefore, it can also be said that arts are a lively form of helping people understand life, comprehend life, perfect life, and perfect themselves. Its value lies primarily in elevating people's spiritual realm and cultural quality. It must be affirmed that the phenomenon of arts is diverse and limitless, but they should also be a way of infecting and influencing people with various aspects and layers of benefits through different methods and unique artistic creativity. Literary phenomena that do not possess such functions and roles will exist and continue to appear, but they will never become the mainstream or trend of our arts. Whether it is the obscure "Small Town Stories" or the bold "Northwest Wind," whether it is the "Roots-Seeking Fever" or the "Reflection Fever," "Entertainment Fever," they should all adapt to the public's tastes on the premise of elevating the public's cultural cultivation and aesthetic tastes. Adaptation is for elevation. I believe that a strong sense of responsibility and mission towards the times and the people is an indispensable quality for art workers.

	3. Art Should Be Constantly Innovative
	Art must constantly innovate and strive forward. To scale new artistic heights, I believe one must break through, innovate, absorb, and discard. Art workers should surpass the past in practice, but they cannot and should not dismiss and discard the past without analysis. Without yesterday, how can today begin? Erasing history is erasing China itself and the foundation of Chinese arts. In the creative labor of arts, one should manifest and embody a high degree of socialist humanism, fully expressing the beauty of human nature and human feelings of the people as the main body of our country, as well as their entire spiritual world.

	The realization of the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China is the common struggle goal of contemporary Chinese people. To achieve this goal, we must further elevate the cultural quality of the entire nation. In this regard, art workers have much to do. The Party and the people urgently need arts to fully play its positive role in the reform, invigorate the national spirit, enhance the cohesion of the nation, create a healthy, civilized, democratic, and harmonious social atmosphere, and contribute to the development of socialist productive forces.

    对当前文艺创作的浅见
    叶鸿玑
    近十年来，随着经济体制改革的层层深入，中国当代文艺受到了商品经济和外来文艺的强烈冲击，正在经受着一场巨大的变革。在艰辛的改革中，人民群众需要什么样的文艺来获得精神上的补充和生产上的动力？我认为应该是能够提高全民族的素质，有利于深化改革和社会进步的作品。
    一、真情实感是文艺的生命
    十年来，我国文艺创作的繁荣发展是有目共睹的。但也不庸讳言，真正的优秀作品并不多。这是什么原因呢？我认为这是当代文艺作品失去了真情。作者的感情，无论其喜怒哀乐，如果不到“燃烧”的程度，即客观事物在作者心灵深处引起强烈的共鸣，发而为诗、小说、戏剧，则不会感人。有人曾这样讲过：“有才能的作家写他所能够写的，伟大的作家则写他所不得不写的”。其所以不得不写，乃是因为受了他内心感情的驱使，不写出来他的一颗心就不得宁静。真正的伟大作品所表现的，都是痛彻心肺、直入生命根底的、发自灵魂最深处的至性至情。为什么人民群众喜欢看自己编排的文艺节目？就是因为这些节目真实地反映了人们的喜怒哀乐，尽管还不完美、不精致，但比起某些电影电视剧中演员泪流满面、观众哈哈大笑的作品来，这些朴实无华的“拙作”却显得更具吸引力和生命力。随着改革的深化，各方面的矛盾会更加突出，我们的步子也会有许多艰难。虚假的乐观主义不行，与人民共忧患，才是作家应有的品质，感情的真挚和分量也正在这里。作家只有对改革进行深入的观察和严肃的思考，把自己对改革所抱有的理想和愿望以及对生活的爱憎态度，利用奇妙的语言艺术写进作品里，才能产生激动人心的力量，人们才能受到启发，也才能完成文艺的历史使命。
    二、文艺作品的创作应立足于提高全民族的文化素质
    我深深地感受到，群众文化素质的低下已经严重阻碍着社会的发展和改革前进的步伐。“五四”时期，一大批与国家命运共忧患的文人志士，用他们手中犀利的笔唤醒了沉睡中的国民。那么今天呢？我们应当看到商品经济的大发展对人们的精神领域和生活方式的巨大冲击，应当看到人们是怎样消化、理解冲击所带来的种种矛盾和困惑，应当看到在浮浅、粗俗后面人们对积极、健康、向上的文艺的追求。我不认为这个世界上存在着没有目的性的文学艺术，自有文艺以来，所有的传世之作都是由于产生了广泛而深刻的社会影响，受到了众多读者观众的尊敬与喜爱，才能留存在文艺史上。文学艺术是历史生活、现实生活以及人民在生活进程中的思想、感情以及文化心理的一种真实而自觉的反映和表现，因而也可以说，文艺是帮助人们认识生活、理解生活、完善生活和完善自己的一种生动形式。它的价值首先就在于提高人们的思想境界和文化素质。必须肯定，文艺现象是气象万千和无限多样的，但是它们也应当是以不同的方式和各具特色的艺术独创性给人们以多方面、多层次的有益的感染和影响的。不具备这样的功能和作用的文学现象，当然也会存在而且会不断出现，但它永远也不会成为我们文艺生活中的主流或主潮。无论是朦胧的
  “小城故事”还是豪放的“西北风”，无论是“寻根热”还是“反思热”、“娱乐热”，都应在提高大众的文化修养和审美趣味的前提下去适应群众口味。适应是为了提高。对于时代与人民的强烈的责任感和使命感，我认为是文艺工作者的一种最不可缺少的品格。
    三、文艺应该是不断地创造
    文艺要不断地革新，不断地奋进。要想攀越新的艺术高峰，我认为就必须有所突破、有所创新、有所吸收、有所扬弃。文艺工作者在实践过程中超越过去，但不可以也不可能不加分析的贬斥和摒弃过去。没有昨天，今天从何开始？抹掉历史也就抹掉了中国本身，抹掉了中国文艺的立足点。在文艺的创造性劳动中应当发挥和体现高度的社会主义人道主义精神，充分表现作为我们国家主体的人民的人性美和人情美，以及他们的全部精神世界。
    实现四化、振兴中华，是当代中国人民的共同奋斗目标，为了实现这个目标，我们必须进一步提高全民族的文化素质。在这个方面，文艺工作者是大有可为的。党和人民迫切需要文艺在改革中充分发挥它的积极作用，振奋民族精神，增强全民族的凝聚力，创造健康、文明、民主、和谐的社会风尚，为发展社会主义生产力作出应有的贡献。
