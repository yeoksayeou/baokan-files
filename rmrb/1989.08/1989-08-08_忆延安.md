	Remembering Yan'an
	Fu Zhong
	The water of Yanhe River is a legacy, flowing, flowing,
	Flowing in the hearts of the people.
	Thought of day and night, the longing never ends,
	Hoping to return to the embrace of the motherland through the seasons.
	Qingliang Mountain, Baota Mountain,
	Every peak praises Yan'an.
	The youth welcomes the red spring,
	The ancient city's song strikes fear in the enemy's heart.
	Yanhe River, flowing, flowing,
	Rushing endlessly without end.
	Generation after generation drinks the water of Yan'an,
	The spirit of Yan'an spreads across the country.

    忆延安
    傅钟
    遗作延河水，流呀流，
    流在人们心里头。
    朝思暮念期无尽，
    盼回娘怀度春秋。
    清凉山，宝塔山，
    山山巅巅赞延安。
    迎来青春红似火，
    古城歌震敌胆寒。
    延河水，流呀流，
    奔腾不息无尽头。
    代代同饮延河水，
    延安精神遍神州。
