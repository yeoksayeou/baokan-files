Throughout the vast expanse of the Shengli Oilfield, shacks made of withered tree branches and straw bags can be seen everywhere. These are the camps of those who "eat" the oilfield and "damage" the oilfield. Some people sleep all day in these shacks, and as soon as night falls, they carry buckets and cans to steal oil.

Drivng away these people and creating a safe production environment for the oilfield is the wish of the workers. The oilfield leadership has been calling for this for many years, but so far, they have not come up with a good solution. This matter may require the strong support of relevant local departments.

### 拔掉窝棚

    拔掉窝棚
    在广阔的胜利油田辖区内，随处可见这种用枯树枝干和草袋搭起的窝棚，它是“吃油田”、
  “损油田”人的营地。一些人，白天在窝棚里睡大觉，一到晚间，便携桶带罐外出搜取原油。
    赶走这些人，给油田创造一个安全生产的良好环境，是职工们的心愿。油田领导也呐喊了多年，可至今还拿不出一个好的办法。此事恐怕还需要地方有关部门的大力协助。
