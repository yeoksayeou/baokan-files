A large coalfield has been discovered in Youyu County, Shanxi Province. After surveying and verifying, it is confirmed that the coalfield has a reserve of 3.4 billion tons, belonging to the high-quality thermal coal of the Carboniferous-Permian period. This discovery is of great significance for the development of coal resources in the Yanbei region.

The Youyu coalfield is located near the northwestern edge of the Datong coalfield, covering an area of 165 square kilometers. The terrain is flat, and the coal seams are relatively shallow, making it suitable for development.
