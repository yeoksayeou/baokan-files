In recent years, a large number of migrant individual business owners from provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong have flocked to Longzhong City in Shanxi Province. While these outsiders coming to do business have played a role in stimulating the local economy, they have also presented unique challenges to the family planning efforts.

In response, the Longzhong Region Family Planning Office and the Urban District Administration for Industry and Commerce have taken joint action, implementing a series of effective measures. They have been promoting the Party and government's family planning policies among the migrant individual business owners residing in the urban district, both from within the province and from outside, educating them to foster a national consciousness, to have fewer and better children, and to share the nation's burdens.

This spring, taking advantage of the opportunity to issue new business licenses, the city conducted a strict review of the family planning compliance of migrant individual business owners. Those who violated family planning policies had their business licenses revoked and were fined between 5,000 and 10,000 yuan. Those with poor attitudes were also deported back to their original residences.

The district family planning office, the district administration for industry and commerce, and the landlords renting out properties to business owners signed a tripartite responsibility contract. The contract clearly stipulates that if the landlord knows about an unauthorized pregnancy of a tenant but does not report it, the landlord will be fined 1,000 yuan.

The urban district family planning office and the district administration for industry and commerce also established mail correspondence with the original residences of the migrant business owners to understand their family planning compliance in their original residences, thereby facilitating better supervision.

Currently, all 1,859 households of migrant individual business owners with childbearing capacity residing in the urban district have signed family planning responsibility contracts. From the end of last year to the end of July this year, there have been no violations of family planning policies. Migrant business owner Zhang Xiaoling became unintentionally pregnant this spring. Later, with the help of city officials, she voluntarily underwent an abortion at a hospital.

    流动人口不超生
    ——长治市城区计划生育的新招
    暴贵银
    这几年，从江苏、浙江、福建、广东等省市来长治市摆摊经商的流动个体户纷纷涌入山西省长治市。外地人来经商，对搞活当地经济起了一定的促进作用，可是给计划生育工作也带来了特殊的困难。
    为此，长治地区计划生育办公室和城区工商行政管理局联合行动，推出一系列有力措施。他们向居住在城区内的本省和外省来的流动经商个体户宣传党和政府的计划生育政策，教育他们树立国家观念，少生优生，为国分忧。
    今年春天，利用给经商个体户换发执照的机会，该市对流动经商个体户执行计划生育的情况进行了严格的审查。对违犯计划生育政策的住市流动经商个体户，没收营业执照，并处以5000元至1万元的罚款，态度不好的还要遣返回原籍。
    区计划生育办公室、区工商行政管理局和租赁房屋的房东、租房经商个体户签订三方合同责任书。责任书明确规定：出租房屋的主人对租房经商个体户的计划外怀孕，如知情不报，给房东处以1000元的罚款。
    城区计划生育办公室、区工商行政管理局还与住市经商个体户的原籍建立信函联系，了解住市流动经商个体户在原籍执行计划生育政策的情况，以便更好地监督。
    目前，居住在城区内的1859户有生育能力的流动经商个体户都已签订了计划生育合同责任书。从去年年底到今年7月底，还没有一户违犯计划生育政策。流动经商个体户张小玲今年春天计划外怀了孕，后来在市区同志的帮助下，她主动到医院做了流产手术。
