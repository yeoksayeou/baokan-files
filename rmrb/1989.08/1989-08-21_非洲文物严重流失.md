Recently, a sixteenth-century Benin bronze sculpture was auctioned in London for two million dollars, setting a record for the highest price ever paid for such an item. This male head sculpture, exquisite in craftsmanship and perfect in form, is a treasure of black African art.

Three years ago, another Benin bronze sculpture sold for seventy million dollars in New York. The phenomenon of African artifacts being taken abroad is very serious. In the museums, antique shops, and private collections of Western countries, African artworks can be found everywhere.

How many African artifacts have been dispersed? This number is difficult to calculate. According to figures provided by the International Council of Museums and a German museum in January 1987, there are more than twenty thousand items that can be traced. Most of these artifacts have high cultural and aesthetic value. A UNESCO expert said that it would take at least twenty years to compile a list of African artworks lost abroad.

The loss of so many art treasures not only causes some African countries to lose most of their cultural heritage but also makes it difficult for these countries to study their own culture and history.

The main reasons for the loss of artifacts are the rampant plundering by colonialists over the past two centuries and the private selling of artifacts by Africans.

Although UNESCO established a special committee in 1978 to formulate regulations for the return of illegally occupied historical artifacts to their original owners, Western countries generally hold a reserved attitude towards this. Therefore, these African artifacts will continue to sleep in foreign lands for a long time.

    非洲文物严重流失
    杨汝生
    不久前，一件十六世纪的贝宁青铜雕刻品在伦敦以二百万美元的价格拍卖成交，创造了同类文物的最高纪录。这件男人头像，工艺精湛，尽善尽美，乃是黑非艺术的一件瑰宝。
    三年前，另一件贝宁铜雕也在纽约卖了七十万美元。非洲文物外流的现象十分严重，在西方国家的博物馆、古董店或私人收藏室里，一件件非洲艺术品随处可见。
    非洲文物到底流散了多少？这个数字很难统计。据一九八七年一月国际博物馆理事会和西德一家博物馆提供的数字，仅有案可查的就有两万余件。这些文物中的绝大多数都具有较高的文化和美学价值。联合国教科文组织的一位专家说，要列出流失在外国的非洲艺术品清单，至少要花二十年的时间。
    如此之多艺术珍品的散失，不仅使一些非洲国家的文化遗产丧失殆尽，也给这些国家研究自己的文化和历史带来了困难。
    文物遗失的主要原因是两个多世纪中殖民主义者的肆意掠夺和非洲人的私自贩卖。
    尽管联合国教科文组织于一九七八年设立了专门的委员会，制定了对非法占据的历史文物归还原主的有关规定，但因西方国家对此普遍持保留态度，非洲的这些文物还会长期沉睡于异邦。
