Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 24th.

Chairman Son Sann of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front has called for the "Red Khmer" not to be excluded from all future power structures in Cambodia. He emphasized that only by adopting Prince Sihanouk's proposal to establish a temporary national unity government in Cambodia can internal conflict be avoided and peace achieved.

Son Sann is currently in Paris attending an international conference on the Cambodian issue. Given that the conference is about to conclude and that Vietnam and Phnom Penh are obstinately rejecting Prince Sihanouk's reasonable proposal, Son Sann sent an urgent appeal to the two co-chairs of this international conference on August 23rd. The appeal was made public today.

    高棉人民民族解放阵线主席宋双呼吁
    柬未来的权力机构不能排除红色高棉
    新华社巴黎8月24日电  高棉人民民族解放阵线主席宋双在此间呼吁，不能把“红色高棉”排除出柬埔寨未来的一切权力机构之外，只有采纳西哈努克亲王关于建立柬埔寨四方民族团结临时政府的建议，才能避免在柬埔寨发生内战而迎来和平。
    宋双目前正在此间出席柬埔寨问题国际会议。鉴于会议即将闭幕而越南和金边顽固拒绝西哈努克的合理建议，宋双于23日致函这次国际会议两主席，发出上述紧急呼吁。此间今天公布了宋双这份呼吁书。
