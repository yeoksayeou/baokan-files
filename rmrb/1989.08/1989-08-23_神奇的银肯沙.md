In the middle section of the Kubuqi Desert within the territory of Dalad Banner in Inner Mongolia, there is a unique sand dune known as Shinkengsha, which is famous for its ability to produce music. The dune is over a hundred meters high, with its base resting on the rocky riverbed of the Han Tai River. The slope is steep, the surface smooth, and the top of the dune is high and prominent.

Why do the sands of Shinkengsha produce music? Scholars and scientists have visited the site to uncover its secrets. Some believe that the sand here carries static electricity, and when heated by the sun and then disturbed by external forces, it produces sounds through electrical discharge. Others suggest that the location of Shinkengsha creates conditions for echoing sounds, so when one area is struck, another area resonates.

However, a fascinating story is circulated among the local people:

Long ago, this place was lush with water and grass, and there was a bustling temple called the Great Dazhao Temple. The temple was home to over two thousand monks. One day, while the monks were performing a grand ceremony to honor the Buddha Sakyamuni, they accidentally disturbed the wandering immortal Zhang Guolao. Zhang Guolao's donkey was carrying two baskets of yellow sand. A shepherd, seeing Zhang Guolao, thought the donkey was carrying something delicious and secretly poked a hole in the basket with his shepherd's hook. Zhang Guolao, unaware, continued walking, and the sand spilled out along the way. By the end of the day, he had walked eight hundred li, and the sand had spread over eight hundred li. Overnight, the vast Kubuqi Desert was formed, burying the ancient Dazhao Temple and the monks. However, the monks, being disciples of the gods, did not die but gathered together to chant scriptures, beat drums, and blow horns—this is the source of the mysterious sounds at the Singing Sands Bay.

Determined to see it for myself, I invited a few friends to visit Shinkengsha. Fortunately, the weather was perfect, with clear skies and dry, golden sand. We eagerly took off our shoes and socks, climbed up the dune using a rope ladder, and then slid down like children on a slide. Immediately, the sand began to produce beautiful music, like flutes and pipes, with all kinds of instruments playing together. Sometimes it sounded like a thousand cowhide drums being beaten at once, and other times it was like a pianist playing a masterpiece. When I accidentally grabbed a handful of sand, it made a "waah—waah" sound, similar to a frog's croak. This is truly a marvel of nature, a masterpiece of the natural world.

In the northwest corner of Shinkengsha, there are 12 Mongolian yurts, 10 camels, and 2 fine horses. There are also fragrant milk tea, cheese, butter, roasted rice, and a sumptuous feast prepared by the Mongolian people to welcome honored guests—roasted lamb is waiting for you.

    神奇的银肯沙
    李增亮
    内蒙古达拉特旗境内库布其沙漠的中段，有一处能奏乐的落沙坡，高百余米。基底坐落在罕台川的石砾河床上，沙坡陡峭，坡面平滑，丘顶高耸，名叫银肯沙。
    银肯沙的沙子为什么能奏乐呢？一些学者、科学家亲临银肯沙探其奥秘。有人认为：这里的沙子带有静电，经太阳照晒，再遇外力滑动撞击，就会发生放电的声音。也有人认为：银肯沙坐落的位置形成了一个能够产生回声的条件，此处受撞击，彼处便要发出回响。
    可在当地群众中流传着的却是这样一个有趣的故事——
    很久以前，这里是一个水草丰美的地方，有一座香火很旺的大昭庙，昭庙里住着两千多名喇嘛。一天，这两千多名喇嘛鼓乐喧天，正在祭奠佛祖释迦牟尼，无意间惊动了正在云游的仙翁张果老。张果老的小毛驴驮着二斗黄沙。有个牧羊娃看见张果老，以为小毛驴又驮了好吃的，就悄悄地在口袋上用放羊叉扎了个口子。张果老只顾往前走，没发现口袋里的黄沙正在往外流。这天，他走了八百里，沙子也撒了八百里。过了一夜，就形成了这片蔓延了八百里的库布其大沙漠。那座古老的大昭庙和喇嘛们，全被埋在了黄沙之中。然而，喇嘛们毕竟是神佛的子弟，他们并没有死，而是集中到一块儿诵经、击鼓吹竽——这便是响沙湾那奇妙声响的源。
    我决心去看个究竟，便约了几位朋友同去游银肯沙。正好赶了个好天气，丽日当空，沙子金黄干燥。我们高兴地脱了鞋袜，沿着软梯爬上丘顶，然后像小孩玩滑梯一样滑下来，立刻，沙子奏出了美妙的音乐，如笙似箫，百乐齐鸣，一会儿像千百面牛皮鼓一齐擂响，一会儿又若钢琴家演奏的绝妙名曲，当我无意抓了一把沙子时，沙子竟发出了“哇——哇”类似青蛙的叫声。这真是天地间的奇观，大自然的杰作。
    在银肯沙的西北角，备有12个蒙古包，骆驼10峰，骏马2匹，还备有香喷喷的奶茶、奶酪、酥油、炒米和蒙古族人民接待尊贵客人的佳美盛宴——摆羊背子在等着您呢。
