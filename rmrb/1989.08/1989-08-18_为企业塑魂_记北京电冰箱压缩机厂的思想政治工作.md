Workers Recognize the Party and Socialism Through the Enterprise

Beijing Refrigerator Compressor Factory has a history of over 30 years. In 1986, when the decision was made to introduce an Italian refrigerator compressor production line, workers saw hope but also felt a sense of disappointment: construction had not yet begun, but the training of personnel for overseas assignments was already causing a stir throughout the factory. Workers felt that the title of "Party member" was greatly at odds with its essence in some people...

By the end of that year, a new factory director, Liu Qixiao, had arrived.

A month later, equipment that had been idle for half a year was all installed; half a year after that, the equipment started running, and soon, new products were born! Seeing the new products, an old worker cried: "I never thought the enterprise would have such a day!"

Director Liu also served as the Party Committee Secretary. His main work began with improving the "image of Party members." Liu Qixiao demanded that Party members and cadres adhere to the principle of "no achievement is a failure." In 1988, the Party Committee of the Compressor Factory made a decision: to strictly adhere to the standards for Party members in recruiting new members, and to actively recruit those who are politically sound and respected in their work. In the past two years, more than 30 new Party members have been recruited, almost all of whom are key figures on the production front. These individuals not only excel in both ideology and work, but each can also lead a group of people.

The image of Party members in the Compressor Factory has changed.

Bai Mingjiu, 46 years old, has worked in this factory for 25 years. For more than 20 years, from his youth to middle age, he had never thought of joining the Party. But last year, he submitted an application to join. He said that in recent years, the Party members in his class and in the factory really seemed like Party members. Bai Mingjiu's change of heart is an evaluation of the Party organization in the Compressor Factory. The Party is not an abstract existence. For the workers of our enterprise, to a large extent, they see the image of the Party through the Party organization and Party members of the enterprise.

The leadership of the Compressor Factory believes that personal image is crucial in conducting ideological education for workers.

After the new production line was put into operation, the factory made a profit of 2.26 million yuan in the first year and 50.96 million yuan in the second year. The loan, originally planned to be repaid in 10 years, may be repaid in 5 years. Despite such impressive economic benefits, they have maintained a frugal style, and the Compressor Factory has yet to build its own guesthouse.

Last year, the factory solved the housing problem for 138 households, of which only one was for a factory-level leader. The factory's performance improved, and many wanted to come in. But none of those transferred in were relatives of factory leaders. Last year, 80% of the workers in the factory had their wages increased by one level, but Director Liu Qixiao, who took 10 days of sick leave, voluntarily proposed to increase by only half a level.

In 1988, the factory's model worker selection was announced, and a cleaning worker who was previously unknown was selected, while the pioneering Director Liu Qixiao, who respected his own opinion, was not on the list. The over-50-year-old cleaning worker Wang Fugu, diligent and unassuming, would use his hands to clear a blocked toilet if the tools were not working. When the leadership delivered the award to his doorstep, he shed tears, saying, "I have contributed too little to the enterprise."

A young worker in the Supply and Marketing Department said: "Our leaders can turn big principles into their actions, and we have confidence in the factory and the country."

Democratic Management Includes Education

In the Compressor Factory, the Workers' Congress is the main form for workers to exercise their democratic rights. According to regulations, it should be held twice a year, but this year, for issues related to wages, bonuses, contracts, and welfare, five Workers' Congresses have been held. At the Workers' Congress, relevant department personnel, including the director, must provide convincing explanations on the spot for the representatives' inquiries. Now, workshop workers take the selection of representatives very seriously; they want to choose people with analytical abilities.

Representatives of the Workers' Congress have the right to express different opinions on the decisions of the Factory Affairs Meeting. The director can also use the Workers' Congress to fully defend the decisions of the Factory Affairs Meeting. Last year, after the factory exceeded the profit target, the Factory Affairs Meeting decided to raise the wages of workers who had done well. During the discussion at the Workers' Congress, many representatives tended to favor a one-level increase for everyone. The director argued that to improve the labor enthusiasm of workers, the difference in labor attitude must be reflected in income. He insisted on his opinion. The representatives thought the director's argument was reasonable and quickly accepted it, and voluntarily went to do ideological work for the majority of workers.

Democratic management makes every worker feel their proper position in the enterprise. At the same time, it also makes every worker feel their responsibility to the enterprise.

The director frequently reports his thoughts on management to the workers, letting them know what the leadership is thinking. Departmental cadres work in the workshops for two days each month, listening to workers' opinions on management.

"The Community of Destiny"—The Foundation of Ideological Education

During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the Compressor Factory remained relatively stable. Workers stayed at their posts and continued production, with no one taking to the streets to protest. Workers who were late for work due to traffic jams also called the factory to inquire about the production situation.

When the counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in Beijing, hundreds of workers rode bicycles all night to the factory, guarding the factory gate. Why could they do this? The main reason is that workers have linked their own destiny with that of the enterprise.

After the new production line of the Compressor Factory started operating, the benefits were good. They could have found many excuses to delay the repayment of the state's loan for 10 years and keep the money to improve workers' welfare. But they did not do this. Zhang Zhengxi, the director of the Planning Department, said: "The sooner we repay the loan, the sooner we can pay taxes to the state." Workers know that if the state does not invest, no matter how capable the people of the Compressor Factory are, they will still be poor with old cows and broken carts! Therefore, workers fully support the factory's decisions.

Once workers pour their feelings into the enterprise, the enterprise is no longer just a material existence. In the minds of workers, it is also a spiritual carrier, a hope, a trust, and a support for destiny. Therefore, when a certain drill bit was urgently needed and production was about to be affected, workers from the tool workshop traveled thousands of miles to the production factory, found the drill bit from a pile of goods weighing several tons, and carried it back.

Wang Chaohui, a young worker who has been in the factory for just two years, said: "Every time I see our director on TV, I have a special sense of pride and closeness. It's as if that's not the director, but me."

Recently, the Compressor Factory passed the national second-level enterprise evaluation with excellent results. All 14 indicators met the second-level standard, with 5 indicators reaching the second-level standard and 9 indicators reaching or exceeding the first-level standard.

In the central courtyard of the Compressor Factory, two tall flagpoles stand. Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Wang Wenting told us: Soon, they will conduct a weekly flag-raising ceremony for the national flag and the factory flag, further imprinting the idea of connecting the destiny of the state, the enterprise, and the workers in everyone's heart.

    为企业塑魂
    ——记北京电冰箱压缩机厂的思想政治工作
    王清宪　秦华
    职工从企业中认识党、认识社会主义
    北京电冰箱压缩机厂，是个有30多年历史的企业。1986年，决定引进意大利电冰箱压缩机生产线时，工人在看到希望的同时，也感到某种失望：建设还没有开始，出国人员培训的事却在全厂闹得沸沸扬扬。职工们觉得，党员这个名称在一些人身上与其内涵反差太大了……
    这年年底，压缩机厂新来了一位厂长——刘启超。
    一个月后，躺了半年的设备全部安装好；半年后设备开动，不久，新产品诞生了！见到新产品，一位老职工哭了：“没想到企业还有今天！”
    刘厂长又兼党委书记，他的工作主要是从抓“党员形象”开始的。刘启超对党员干部提出“无功便是过”的要求。1988年，压缩机厂党委作出一项决定：要严格按照党员的标准来发展党员，对那些政治思想好、业务上大家佩服的人，要积极发展他们入党。近两年来发展的30多名党员，几乎全是生产第一线的骨干。这些人不仅自身在思想和业务上过得硬，而且每个人都可以带动一片人。
    党员在压缩机厂的形象变了。
    白明久，今年46岁，在这个工厂已有25年的工龄了。20多年来，从青年进入了中年，他没有想到过入党。但去年他递交了入党申请书。他说，他觉得这几年，班上的党员、厂里的党员确实有个党员的样儿了。白明久的这一转变，是对压缩机厂党组织的一种评价。党不是一个抽象的存在。对于我们企业的职工来说，在很大程度上是从企业的党组织、企业的党员身上看党的形象。
    压缩机厂的领导认为，对职工进行思想教育，自身形象如何，十分重要。
    新的生产线投入运转后，这个厂第一年盈利226万，第二年盈利5096万。原定10年还清的贷款，有可能5年还清。在这样可观的经济效益情况下，他们仍然保持了节俭作风，压缩机厂至今没有兴建自己的招待所。
    去年，全厂共解决了138户的住房，其中只有一户厂级领导。工厂的效益好了，不少人想进来。但调进来的没有一个厂领导亲属。去年全厂80％职工向上浮动一级工资，厂长刘启超因请了10天病假，主动提出只长半级。
    1988年厂里评功臣活动揭晓了，一位名不见经传的清洁工中选，而具有开拓精神的厂长刘启超，却因尊重其本人意见，榜上无名。50多岁的清洁工王富贵，勤勤恳恳，不声不响。厕所堵了，工具不好使，他就用手去掏。当领导把奖品送上家门时，他落下了眼泪，说：“我为企业贡献太少了。”
    供销科的青年工人说：我们厂领导能把大道理化在他们的行动中，我们对厂、对国家充满信心。
    民主管理包含着教育
    在压缩机厂，职工代表大会是工人行使民主权利的主要形式。按规定，每年召开两次，可今年上半年，为工资、奖金、承包、福利问题就开了五次职代会。职代会上，有关部门同志包括厂长在内，对代表的质询要当场给以令人信服的解释。现在，车间工人对谁当代表十分认真，他们要选有分析能力的人。
    职代会代表有权对厂务会决定提出不同意见，厂长也可以通过职代会为厂务会决定作充分申辩。去年工厂超额完成利润指标后，厂务会议决定给干得好的职工长工资。职代会讨论时，不少代表倾向每人长一级。厂长申辩说，为了提高职工劳动积极性，必须使劳动态度好坏在收入上得到体现。他坚持自己的意见。代表认为厂长申辩有理，很快接受了，并主动去做广大职工的思想工作。
    民主管理使每一个职工感受到自己在企业中应有的地位。同时也使每个职工感受到自己对企业的责任。
    厂长不断地向职工汇报自己在经营中的想法，让职工知道领导在想什么。科室干部每月要到车间工作两天，听取职工对管理的意见。
      “命运共同体”——思想教育的根基
    在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，压缩机厂却相当稳定，职工坚守岗位，坚持生产，没有一个上街游行的。因道远交通阻塞不能按时上班的职工，也要打电话到工厂，询问生产情况。
    北京发生反革命暴乱时，数百名职工骑自行车连夜赶到工厂，守在工厂大门口。为什么能够这样？主要原因就是职工把自己的命运同企业的命运联系在一起了。
    压缩机厂新的生产线运转以后，效益很好。对国家的贷款，他们本可以找出许多借口拖10年再还，而把钱扣下来搞职工福利。但他们没有这样做。计划科长张正喜说：“我们早一天还完贷款，可以早一天向国家上缴利税。”职工都知道，要是国家不投资，你压缩机厂的人再能耐，老牛破车疙瘩套，还不照样受穷？！所以工人完全支持厂里的决策。
    职工一旦把感情注入企业，企业就不是一个单纯物质的存在。在职工心目中，它也是一个精神载体，是希望，是寄托，是命运的依托。所以，当某种钻头告急，眼看要影响生产时，工具车间的工人千里迢迢，赶到生产厂家，把已发往货场的钻头从几吨的货堆中找出来，背了回来。
    刚刚进厂两年的青工王朝辉说：“每次我在电视上看到我们厂长的镜头，心里有一种特别自豪、特别亲切的感觉。好像那不是厂长，而是我自己。”
    不久前，压缩机厂以优异成绩通过了国家二级企业考评。所有十四项指标中，五项达到二级标准，九项达到或超过一级标准。
    在压缩机厂大院中央，竖立着两支高高的旗杆。厂党委副书记王文亭告诉我们：不久，他们将进行每周一次的升国旗、升厂旗活动，把国家、企业、职工命运相连的思想，更深地印在每个人的心中。
