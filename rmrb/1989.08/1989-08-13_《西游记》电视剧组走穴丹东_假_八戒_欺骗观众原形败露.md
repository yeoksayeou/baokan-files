Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 12th

The "Journey to the West" TV drama troupe, led by Zhang Yuqing, the director of the Jiamusi City Snow City Art Troupe, performed in Dandong and Donggou. The actor playing "Pigsy" was impersonated by Li Jiancheng, replacing Ma Dexue, deceiving the audience. This incident has been seriously handled by relevant departments in Dandong.

The details are as follows: When the troupe left Beijing in early August, Ma Dexue was unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances, and Li Jiancheng was temporarily found to replace him. After arriving in Dandong, the posters and advertisements still featured Ma Dexue. The troupe leader should have informed the municipal cultural department about the situation, but they feared that revealing the truth would affect ticket sales, so they intentionally concealed it. On August 5th, after the first performance at the Dandong Sports Gymnasium, the audience discovered the deception, and media interviews were refused. This troupe performed two shows at the Dandong Sports Gymnasium on August 5th and 6th, with nearly 8,000 audience members, divided into two ticket categories: 5 yuan and 4 yuan. On August 7th and 8th, they performed two shows at the Donggou County Theater, with ticket prices at 6 yuan. In total, over 10,000 audience members attended the four shows, generating over 30,000 yuan in ticket sales.

After the incident, actors Liu Xilong, Chi Zhongrui, and Yan Huaili arrived at the Dandong Municipal Propaganda Department on August 8th to express their remorse. The relevant departments in Dandong have seriously handled this incident of impersonation and deceiving the public: First, the troupe leader and actors were criticized and educated; second, the troupe leader Zhang Yuqing was ordered to write a written self-criticism and publish it in the "Dandong Daily" to apologize to the audience; third, fines were imposed based on the attitude of their self-criticism.

    《西游记》电视剧组走穴丹东  假“八戒”欺骗观众原形败露
    新华社沈阳8月12日电  以佳木斯市雪城艺术团团长张玉庆为穴头，率领电视连续剧《西游记》剧组走穴丹东、东沟等地演出，饰演“猪八戒”的演员由李建成冒名顶替马德华，欺骗观众，受到丹东市有关部门的严肃处理。
    事情经过是这样的：剧组8月初从北京启程时，马德华因故不能前往，临时找到李建成顶替。剧组到丹东后，海报、广告登的都是马德华，穴头本应向市文化部门说明情况，但他们怕暴露真象会影响票房价值，故而有意隐瞒。8月5日在丹东市体育馆头场演出后，观众发现有假，新闻单位采访被拒绝。这个剧组8月5日、6日在丹东体育馆演出两场，观众近8000人，分甲、乙票，票价分别为5元和4元。7日、8日在东沟县剧场演出两场，票价6元。前后4场演出，观众上万，票房收入3万多元。
    事情发生后，演员六小龄童、迟重瑞、阎怀礼3人于8月8日到丹东市委宣传部表示检讨。丹东市有关部门对这起冒名顶替、欺骗群众的演出事件进行了严肃处理：一、对穴头及演员进行批评教育；二、责令穴头张玉庆写出书面检讨，并在《丹东日报》上发表，向观众赔礼道歉；三、根据认错态度好坏，给予罚款处理。
