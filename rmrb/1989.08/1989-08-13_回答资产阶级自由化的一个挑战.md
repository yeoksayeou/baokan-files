In recent years, some advocates of bourgeois liberalization have sought to deny China's socialist system, advocating that China take the capitalist path. They openly spread the idea that China's democratic revolution was "incomplete," and thus China's society remains "feudalist." They even claim that China's socialism is merely "feudalism painted with socialist colors."

We must now respond to this challenge from bourgeois liberalization.

I. The Socialist Nature of Our Society is Indisputable

The new democratic revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party, which opposed imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved a complete victory and is recorded in history.

This great victory's completeness is marked by the following:

First, it completely defeated the Japanese invaders and drove out the British and American forces in China, shattering the imperialists' dream of making China a permanent colony.

Second, it completely destroyed the Nationalist government, which represented the interests of the feudal landlord class, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and imperialism. The Communist Party of China became the ruling party. The people's democratic dictatorship, led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, became the state system. The broad masses of laboring people became the masters of the state and society.

Third, it completely abolished the feudal land system. The feudal land system was the root cause of China's backward and impoverished status in modern times. The feudal landlord class was the main social foundation for imperialism and its running dogs (including the Qing Dynasty, the Beiyang warlords, and the Nationalist reactionaries) to rule China. Because our party firmly implemented the land revolution line of "relying on poor and hired peasants, uniting middle peasants, restricting rich peasants, protecting small industrialists and merchants, and completely eliminating the landlord class," it completely carried out the land system reform. Since then, feudalism as a social system has been completely buried in the soil of China.

All this proves that China's new democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism was complete and was the only successful democratic revolution in Chinese history.

After achieving a complete victory in the new democratic revolution, the ruling Chinese Communist Party, in order to develop the productive forces and free the Chinese people from poverty and backwardness forever, while concentrating on the recovery and construction of the national economy, actively created conditions for China's society to transition from new democracy to socialism. This transition condition was created in the process of the new democratic economy's development. The expulsion of imperialist forces and the abolition of their privileges in China created the premise for the independent and autonomous development of the socialist economy. The complete abolition of the feudal land system opened the way for the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the rapid development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations (including mutual aid groups and primary cooperatives) with socialist germinal characteristics after the land reform induced farmers' enthusiasm for the socialist path. Various forms of semi-socialist state capitalism opened the door for capitalists to accept socialist transformation through the "buyout" policy. After taking over imperialist enterprises in China and confiscating bureaucratic capital, a powerful state-owned economy that firmly controls the lifeblood of the national economy was established. Its rapid development and dominant role in the national economy created a reliable material foundation for the entire society's transition to socialism. All this provided a realistic possibility and objective conditions for the Chinese people to take the socialist path.

China transitioned from a feudal society to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society, and through the new democratic revolution, it completely freed itself from the semi-colonial, semi-feudal status. Then, through the new democratic transitional period, it entered socialist society. This is the inevitable choice that history has made for the Chinese people.

Now, after more than thirty years of socialist construction, China's socialist system has a considerable and substantial material and technological foundation.

We have established an independent and complete modern industrial system. In 1986, the proportion of industrial output value in the total output value of industry and agriculture reached 74%.

Currently, more than 95% of the total industrial output value, more than 80% of the total agricultural output value, and about 80% of the retail sales of commodities are created by the socialist public ownership economy.

Corresponding to this, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" is implemented in the public ownership economy (including state-owned economy, collective economy, and cooperative economy).

In other words, in China, socialist public ownership has a dominant and absolute advantage in the national economy. The public ownership of the means of production and the common prosperity embodied by the distribution according to work are the guiding direction of the entire society's development. If we acknowledge that public ownership and common prosperity embodied by the distribution according to work are the two fundamental principles of socialism, and acknowledge that these two principles are the cornerstone and fundamental mark of the socialist system, then the socialist nature of our society is beyond doubt.

It is undeniable that the level of social productive forces in China is still very low and has not yet shaken off the conditions of poverty and backwardness. Precisely because of this, our party now recognizes that China is still in the primary stage of socialism.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has proposed the general line of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This general line includes the two inseparable basic contents of adhering to the four cardinal principles and adhering to the policy of reform and opening up. Under the guidance of the four cardinal principles, through the correct implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, we will realize the continuous reform and perfection of the socialist system itself, and thus vigorously develop the productive forces. We will definitely be able to complete the task of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Currently, reform and opening up are being deepened and developed, from the reform of the economic system to the reform of the political system, thereby promoting the comprehensive development of socialist modernization construction and the comprehensive improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. There is no reason to doubt that our policy of reform and opening up will definitely succeed, and there is no reason to doubt that the socialist system has the ability to self-adjust, reform, and perfect itself.

Scientific socialism has deeply taken root in the land of China, and it has a strong vitality and a brilliant future.

II. We Must Draw a Clear Line Between Socialism and Feudalism

Our party is soberly aware that, at the present stage, some defects and weak links in the socialist system, some defects in the party and state leadership system, especially some corrupt phenomena and other undesirable phenomena in party style and social customs, are to varying degrees and in varying scopes related to the influence of the remnants of feudal ideology. Our party has never concealed this. Moreover, it is our party, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who has proposed the task of especially paying attention to preventing and eliminating the remnants of feudal ideology under the conditions of reform and opening up.

Indeed, this task still has the nature of a democratic revolution, but it cannot be imagined that it can be completed through bourgeois democracy, but only through the development of socialist democracy and the improvement of socialist legal system. Because, after all, the remnants of feudal ideology exist in people's minds. For the vast number of cadres and the masses, it can only be realized through self-education and self-transformation in the process of developing socialist democracy and improving socialist legal system.

Currently, the situation is that bourgeois liberalization has appeared in China, using the banner of opposing feudalism to deny the socialist nature of Chinese society, and using this to create public opinion for advocating the capitalist path. Therefore, it is very necessary to draw a clear line between socialism and feudalism in politics and ideology.

One of their arguments is that China's socialist system is built on the basis of feudal small-scale peasant economy, and thus is "feudal socialism."

Is this really the case? No.

First, the productive forces on which China entered socialism are not some hand-operated mill-style small production, but rather the socialized large production that dominates the national economy. According to statistics, by the time the socialist transformation of the means of production was basically completed in 1957, the output of China's major industrial products exceeded the total output of the major capitalist countries in the world a hundred years ago. If Marx and Engels believed that the major capitalist countries at that time had the material basis for a socialist revolution, why can't China enter socialism based on the material basis of 1957?

Second, after more than thirty years of construction, China's level of productive forces has reached a considerable height. In terms of the ranking of China's major industrial products in the world, in 1985 compared to the early days of liberation, steel rose from the 26th position to the 4th, coal from the 9th to the 2nd, electricity generation from the 25th to the 5th, crude oil from the 27th to the 6th, and cement and cotton cloth respectively from the 8th and 3rd positions in 1957 to the first position. Isn't this a clear proof that the socialist relations of production have promoted the development of productive forces?

We can say that China's socialist system was established on the ruins of old China, but the claim that it was established on the basis of feudal small-scale peasant economy is absurd.

One of their arguments is that China's economy is still dominated by natural economy, and natural economy is the economic basis of feudal society, so China's socialism is "feudal."

Is this really the case? No.

We admit that China's agricultural production still has a strong natural economy character and has not yet completely shaken off the state of self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency. However, first, natural economy is not equal to feudal economy. The self-sufficient, direct consumption for oneself and exploiters, often family-based self-completion of the reproduction process of natural economy appeared as early as the end of the primitive society. This is common sense.

Moreover, natural economy is just an economic form, and it cannot immediately disappear with the change of the mode of production. In the mid-19th century, France had already become a capitalist society, but at that time, small production natural economy still accounted for a considerable proportion in France's economic relations. In China, with the development of socialist economic construction, the proportion of self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency natural economy in the national economy has already and is continuing to shrink.

Furthermore, although there is still a self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency natural economy in China's countryside, China's commodity economy has indeed developed on a large scale. Statistical data shows that the national retail commodity sources in the first five five-year plans developed at an average rate of 40.9%, and the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period increased by 88.8% compared to the "Fifth Five-Year Plan" period. Even before 1978, the "leftist" guiding ideology and policies did not completely stagnate China's commodity economy. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the development of China's commodity economy has greatly accelerated. With the deepening of reform and opening up, China's commodity economy based on public ownership and planned economy will develop even faster.

In China's socialist economic system, natural economy has never occupied a dominant position in the past, and it will not be able to occupy such a position in the future.

One of their arguments is that there is no democracy in China's political life, only "authoritarianism," so China's socialism is "feudal."

Is this really the case? No.

Here, we will not go into detail about the issue of democracy. Democracy has class characteristics, and there is no class-transcending, abstract, general democracy in the world. In human history, democracy has always appeared in the form of a state. In modern states, it is either bourgeois democracy or proletarian socialist democracy. China's socialist democracy has three basic contents: one is the state system, that is, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, in short, it is the position of the laboring people as masters of the house; one is the political system, that is, the system of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses organized according to the principle of democratic centralism, in short, it is the form of the laboring people as masters of the house; one is the basic rights and duties of citizens guaranteed by the constitution and laws under such a state system and political system, in short, it is the behavior of the laboring people as masters of the house. We do not deny that the development of China's socialist democracy is still very inadequate. This is related to the defects in the party and state leadership system, and also to the fact that the legal system guaranteeing socialist democracy is not yet perfect. However, China's achievements in socialist construction, reform and opening up, and improvement of people's lives have proven that China's political superstructure is basically in line with the socialist economic base.

Here, we should also talk about the problem of defects in the party and state leadership system. Those who put forward this argument say that China has had the phenomenon of personality cult, and there has been a system of excessive concentration of power and lifelong leadership positions, and all of these are the remnants of feudalism. These defects did exist and have not yet been completely overcome. However, to say that all these phenomena are remnants of feudalism is a baseless and arbitrary assumption, because it lacks scientific analysis. It is true that these phenomena have feudal factors at work, but they are not the only factors at work. For example, the personality cult of Mao Zedong, the concentration of power necessary for the revolutionary war years, the democratic tradition formed in the revolutionary struggle that did not further institutionalize after the founding of the nation, the personal prestige of Mao Zedong himself due to the great victories in leading the Chinese revolution and construction, these are all important factors. As for the excessive concentration of power and the lifelong leadership positions, they are also related to the leadership methods and methods formed by the long-term revolutionary war and the divided rural environment, and also to the fact that we copied the experience and model of the Soviet Union in the early days of the founding of the nation. For a long time, we believed that the socialist system and the planned management system required highly centralized management of all aspects of national life, and did not solve the problems of the responsibilities of various levels of party and government organs, the appropriate division of labor between party and government, the system of personal responsibility and mass supervision, etc. However, since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, it is our party that has proposed these problems as tasks of political reform, and is solving these problems in the process of political reform.

One of their arguments is that there are many feudal elements in the ideological field of China, or there is a "feudal sediment," so China's socialism is "feudal."

Is this really the case? No.

We know that social consciousness is a reflection of social existence. After a certain ideology is formed, it has relative independence. The transformation of ideology often lags behind the transformation of the social system. This is a common law of the development of ideology in any social form, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. For example, the "creation of the world by God" that dominated medieval Europe still haunts people's minds today as a supernatural and antisocial force. Some schools in the United States ban the spread of Darwin's theory of evolution, and a state judge rules that this behavior is legal, which is an example. In some developed capitalist countries, there are still a large number of feudal superstitions, patriarchal ideas, monarchical ideas, and noble privileges, which are well-known facts.

China's socialist system has not been established for a long time, and the existence of some feudal ideology is nothing strange. What is strange is that the nature of society is judged solely on the basis of ideology. To put it mildly, it is ignorance; to put it strongly, it is malicious.

They also have an argument that China's traditional culture or so-called "old cultural system" is all "feudal dross," and has formed a so-called "feudal cultural field." All new things and new ideas, including Marxism, communism, socialism, and even the Communist Party, once they enter this "cultural field," are destined to be "distorted" and "deformed" into a "variant" of feudalism. Therefore, socialism in China has become "feudalism painted with socialist colors."

Is this really the case? No.

Here, we will not talk about other things, not about their denial and slander of Marxism, communism, socialism, the Communist Party, and the Chinese revolution led by it (including the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution), nor about their purpose of denying and slandering, which is to oppose the party's leadership and oppose the socialist system, and to try to turn independent and autonomous socialist China into a satellite of the West. This is something that people with normal minds and psychology can see through.

Here, we will only talk about the attitude towards China's cultural tradition. Our Chinese nation has a six-thousand-year history of civilization, leaving us with a deep cultural tradition and cultural heritage. This is something that every descendant of the Chinese nation takes pride in and is proud of. Of course, the two-thousand-year feudal society has brought a lot of feudal dross to traditional culture, which cannot be ignored. However, to regard the six-thousand-year culture of the Chinese nation as a whole as feudal culture, and to regard it as a whole as feudal dross, and to completely negate it, is an unacceptable attitude of national nihilism. The six-thousand-year culture of the Chinese nation is not all feudal culture, this is one; the six-thousand-year cultural tradition indeed has its dross part, but the excellent, advanced part with people's nature, democratic nature, and revolutionary nature is its main essence, this is two; for the two-thousand-year feudal culture, there is also a distinction between the early and late periods, and a distinction between the part belonging to the rulers and the part belonging to the people. Even the part belonging to the ruling class has a large amount of content that is close to the people and has people's nature and democratic nature, this is three; in modern China, there is also the advanced bourgeois cultural tradition and revolutionary tradition represented by Sun Yat-sen, and since the May Fourth Movement, there is also the cultural tradition and revolutionary tradition of the Chinese Communist Party representing the working class and led by Marxism, both of which inherit and carry forward the essence of the cultural tradition and revolutionary tradition of the Chinese nation, this is four. How can we treat the cultural tradition in a general way and completely denigrate it as "feudal dross"? This so-called "new thinking," so-called "cultural reflection," does not make any historical and scientific analysis of the cultural tradition, does it have any rationality? This attitude towards the cultural tradition of the Chinese nation is nothing more than selling the idea of "complete Westernization."

It can be seen that, for those who advocate bourgeois liberalization, on the issue of the boundary between socialism and feudalism, they are not a matter of one-sided understanding of social history, but rather using the banner of opposing feudalism to deny the socialist system and oppose the four cardinal principles.

For the defects in the party and state leadership system, for the defects in various systems, for the shortcomings and mistakes in various concrete work including reform and opening up, for the corruption and other undesirable phenomena in the party and social life, our party not only allows but also advocates the use of education and law to carry out extensive mass supervision. However, the starting point and purpose must be to adhere to the four cardinal principles, to support rather than oppose the party's leadership, to support rather than oppose the socialist system, so as to better carry out reform and opening up. For the elimination of the remnants of feudal ideology and their influence, the starting point and purpose are the same. It is absolutely not allowed to use the banner of opposing feudalism to promote bourgeois liberalization and oppose the four cardinal principles.

III. Unmask the Trick of Spreading Bourgeois Liberalization Under the Banner of Opposing Feudalism

Bourgeois liberalization is a political concept, because its core is to deny and oppose the party's leadership and to deny and oppose the socialist system. Its essence is to restore capitalism in China and turn socialist China into a satellite of the West. However, as a trend of thought, it has spread a series of propositions, views, and theories in the fields of economy, politics, culture, ideology, and social life, especially in the various fields of ideology, thus creating great confusion in society and poisoning the minds of people, especially the youth. In terms of worldview, the most harmful to society, especially to the youth, is the extreme individualism, hedonism, money worship, anarchism, and worship of the West centered on "self-realization" or "realizing self-worth."

It should be seen that the remnants of feudal ideology, today and in the future, are already and will be combined with various decadent bourgeois ideas. Although the forms of combination are diverse, they all show the characteristics of the combination of the remnants of feudal ideology on the one hand and the decadent bourgeois ideas of extreme individualism, hedonism, money worship, anarchism, and worship of the West (especially the way of life) on the other hand. The most prominent feature of this combination is the combination of "worship of power" and "worship of money." All illegal business operations, tax evasion, speculation, bribery, embezzlement, theft, smuggling, fraud, and other criminal activities are all products of this combination.

The problem posed by reality is very clear: it is precisely bourgeois liberalization that is the breeding ground for the remnants of feudal ideology and various decadent bourgeois ideas.

Advocates of bourgeois liberalization stand out and say that if China had gone through a "complete capitalist development stage," the remnants of feudalism would have long entered the history museum. Therefore, to eliminate the remnants of feudalism, China must go back to "make up for the capitalist lesson" and re-take the "complete capitalist development" path. This prescription is truly fantastic, detached from reality, and shocking in its disregard for history.

First of all, in human history, the capitalist system and the feudal system are essentially systems of man exploiting man and man oppressing man. The replacement of feudalism by capitalism in human history undoubtedly played a very great progressive role, but the entire history of this replacement proves that it is only a system of exploitation replacing another system of exploitation. Feudalism, for capitalism, can serve the latter, and the latter can use the former. They can coexist. After capitalism has experienced two or three hundred years of "complete development," we can still see things such as: constitutional monarchy, emperor system, Junkers landlord system, primogeniture, caste system, actual hereditary nobility, various types of factional relationships, various criminal organizations, and male chauvinism in developed capitalist countries.

Secondly, in the history of capitalist revolution, including the British Revolution, the American Independence Revolution, and the French Revolution, the bourgeois revolution indeed played a "very revolutionary role" and "destroyed all feudal, patriarchal, and idyllic relations" (see Marx and Engels: The Communist Manifesto). However, how thorough was it? The British Revolution ended with the establishment of a constitutional monarchy by the joint dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the new nobility, and it has continued to this day. After the American Independence Revolution, the established government was a joint dictatorship of the big bourgeoisie and the slave owners, and the remnants of slavery, racial discrimination, not only still exist seriously today, but have also developed from discriminating against blacks to discriminating against all colored people, including Chinese Americans. The French Revolution is considered to have been the most thorough in destroying the feudal system, but subsequently, for eighty years, the First Empire of Napoleon, the Restoration of the Bourbon Dynasty, and the Second Empire of Louis Bonaparte appeared in succession, and even today, there are activities of members of the noble families of past dynasties wearing noble insignia.

Thirdly, in Chinese history, the advanced Chinese represented by Sun Yat-sen not only used Western bourgeois social and political science to criticize feudal autocracy, but also took up arms to carry out the Xinhai Revolution. Later, they still failed in the face of the reactionary forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. History has proven that under the conditions of being a semi-colony and semi-feudal country, China could not have had any "complete capitalist development stage." Today, the attempt to restore capitalism in China can only turn socialist China into a satellite of the West, which is unacceptable to all Chinese people except the hostile elements.

Finally, the socialist system is fundamentally incompatible with feudalism in essence. We have completely eliminated the feudal system of exploitation, and only in the ideological field do remnants of feudal thought exist. The history of China for more than a century since the Opium War proves that only the Chinese Communist Party has raised the banner of completely opposing feudalism. Today, when the socialist system has been established, only the Chinese Communist Party can lead the Chinese people to carry out the struggle to eliminate the remnants of feudal ideology to the end.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has long proposed the task of opposing and resisting the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes in the ideological field, especially the task of opposing and resisting bourgeois liberalization while carrying out the struggle to prevent and eliminate the remnants of feudal ideology.

Given that those who engage in bourgeois liberalization use the banner of opposing feudalism and have great deceptiveness and seductiveness, we must remain sober-minded. No matter what, we must not let them deceive the masses, especially the youth, with various kinds of preaching. For example: taking anarchism as opposing feudal patriarchy, taking "complete Westernization" as opposing cultural autocracy, taking peddling "political pluralism," denying the party's leadership, and denying the socialist system as opposing feudal autocracy. In a word, we must not let them take the negation and opposition of the four cardinal principles as opposing feudalism. We must be vigilant against these seductive incitements and deceptions from bourgeois liberalization and expose them at any time.

    回答资产阶级自由化的一个挑战
    熊复
    近几年来，有一些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，为了否定我国的社会主义制度，主张中国走资本主义道路，公然散布一种观点，说什么我国的民主革命是“不彻底的”，因而中国社会仍然是“封建主义的”，甚至说中国的社会主义只是什么“抹上社会主义油彩的封建主义”。
    我们现在不能不回答来自资产阶级自由化的这一挑战。
    一、我国社会的社会主义性质是不容怀疑的
    中国共产党领导的中国人民反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命是以取得彻底的胜利而载入史册的。
    这一伟大胜利的彻底性具有以下的几个重要标志：
    第一、彻底地打败了日本侵略者，彻底地驱逐了英美在华势力，使帝国主义把中国沦为永久殖民地的梦想完全破灭。
    第二、彻底地摧毁了代表封建地主阶级、官僚资产阶级和帝国主义的利益的国民党政权，创建了中华人民共和国。无产阶级的政党——中国共产党成为执政党。工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政成为中国的国体。广大劳动人民成了国家和社会的主人。
    第三、彻底地消灭了封建土地所有制。封建土地制度是近代中国处于被侵略、被压迫和贫困落后地位的根源。封建地主阶级是帝国主义及其走狗（包括清王朝、北洋军阀和国民党反动派）统治中国的主要社会基础。由于我们党坚定地执行了“依靠贫雇农、联合中农、限制富农、保护中小工商业者、彻底消灭地主阶级”这条土地革命路线，彻底地进行了土地制度的改革。从此几千年来作为一种社会制度的封建主义在中国大地上已经被彻底埋葬了。
    这一切都证明，我国反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命是彻底的，是中国历史上唯一的成功的民主革命。
    在取得新民主主义革命的彻底胜利之后，执政的中国共产党为了发展社会生产力，使中国人民永远摆脱贫困落后的状况，在集中全力进行国民经济的恢复和建设的同时，积极准备条件以使我国社会由新民主主义向社会主义过渡。这个过渡的条件是在新民主主义经济发展的过程中逐步创造出来的。帝国主义势力的被驱逐及其在华特权的被取消，为独立自主地发展社会主义经济创造了前提；封建土地制度的彻底废除，为对农业进行社会主义改造开辟了道路，而土地改革后迅速发展起来的具有社会主义萌芽性质的农业生产互助合作组织（包括互助组和初级合作社）诱发了农民走社会主义道路的积极性；各种形式的具有半社会主义性质的国家资本主义，打开了资本家通过接受“赎买”政策而接受社会主义改造的大门；接管帝国主义在华企业和没收官僚资本以后，建立了牢固掌握国民经济命脉的强大的国营经济，它的迅速发展及其在国民经济中的主导作用，为整个社会向社会主义过渡创造了可靠的物质基础。这一切都为中国人民走社会主义道路提供了现实可能性和客观条件。
    中国由封建社会变为半殖民地半封建社会，经过新民主主义革命而彻底摆脱半殖民地半封建地位，然后经过新民主主义过渡时期进入社会主义社会，这就是历史让中国人民作出的必然选择。
    现在，经过三十多年的社会主义建设，我国社会主义制度已经有了相当雄厚和相当规模的物质技术基础。
    我们已经建立起独立的完整的现代工业体系。1986年工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重已达74％。
    目前工业总产值的95％以上，农业总产值的80％以上，商品零售额的80％左右，都是由社会主义公有制经济创造的。
    与此相适应，在公有制经济（包括国营经济、集体经济和合作经济）中实行的是“各尽所能、按劳分配”的原则。
    这就是说，在我国，社会主义公有制在国民经济中已占有主导地位和绝对优势。生产资料的公有和由按劳分配体现的共同富裕，是整个社会发展的主导方向。如果承认公有制和以按劳分配体现的共同富裕是社会主义的两条根本原则，承认这两条原则是社会主义制度的基石和根本标志，那末，我国社会的社会主义性质是无可怀疑的。
    勿庸讳言，我国社会生产力水平还很低，还没有摆脱贫困和落后的状况。正是因为这样，我们党现在确认，我国还处于社会主义初级阶段。
    我们党自十一届三中全会以来，提出了建设有中国特色的社会主义的总路线。这条总路线包括坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革、开放政策两个统一的不可分割的基本内容。在四项基本原则的指导下，通过改革、开放政策的正确执行，实现社会主义制度自身不断的变革和完善，从而大力发展社会生产力，我们就一定能够完成建设有中国特色的社会主义的任务。
    当前改革、开放正在深入展开，正在由经济体制的改革发展到政治体制的改革，从而推动着社会主义现代化建设的全面发展和人民物质文化生活水平的全面提高。没有理由怀疑我们的改革、开放政策一定会取得成功，也没有理由怀疑我国社会主义制度具有自我调整、变革和完善的能力。
    科学社会主义在中国大地上已经深深地扎下根基，它具有强大的生命力和无比光辉的前景。
    二、必须划清社会主义和封建主义的界限
    我们党清醒地估计到，现阶段我国社会主义制度上的某些缺陷和薄弱环节，党和国家领导制度上的某些弊端，特别是党风和社会风气的某些腐败现象和其他不良现象，都是在不同程度上和不同范围内同封建主义思想残余的影响有关。我们党从来没有掩盖这一点。而且正是我们党，首先是邓小平同志，提出了在改革、开放的条件下要特别注意防止和肃清封建主义思想的残余的任务。
    诚然，这一任务还带有民主革命的性质，但是不能设想凭借资产阶级民主来完成，而只能由发展社会主义民主和健全社会主义法制来完成。因为归根到底，封建主义思想的残余存在于人们的头脑里，对于广大干部和广大群众来说，只有在发展社会主义民主和健全社会主义法制的过程中，通过自我教育和自我改造来实现。
    当前的情况是，资产阶级自由化出现在中国大地上，打起反对封建主义的旗号来否定我国社会的社会主义性质，以此为他们鼓吹走资本主义道路制造舆论。因此，从政治上和思想上彻底划清社会主义和封建主义的界限是十分必要的。
    他们的论据之一是认为，我国的社会主义制度是在封建的小农经济的基础上建立起来的，因而是“封建的社会主义”。
    果真如此吗？不然。
    第一、我国进入社会主义所依据的生产力状况，根本不是什么手推磨式的小生产，恰恰是在国民经济中占主导地位的社会化大生产。据统计，到生产资料的社会主义改造基本完成的1957年，我国主要工业产品的产量，超过了一百年前世界资本主义国家的总产量。如果马克思、恩格斯认为那时的主要资本主义国家就具有进行社会主义革命的物质基础，为什么中国依据1957年的物质基础进入社会主义就不行了呢？
    第二、经过三十多年的建设，我国生产力水平已经达到一个相当的高度。就我国主要工业产品居世界的位次来说，1985年同解放初期相比，钢从第26位上升到第4位，煤从第9位上升到第2位，发电量从第25位上升到第5位，原油从第27位上升到第6位，水泥和棉布分别从1957年的第8位和第3位跃居第一位。这难道不正是社会主义的生产关系促进了生产力发展的明证吗？
    我们可以说我国的社会主义制度是在旧中国的废墟上建立起来的，而认为它是在封建的小农经济的基础上建立起来的说法则是荒谬的。
    他们的论据之一是认为，中国至今在经济上仍然是自然经济占统治地位，而自然经济是封建社会的经济基础，因而中国的社会主义是“封建的”。
    果真如此吗？也不然。
    我们承认，我国农业生产还带有比较浓厚的自然经济的色彩，至今还没有完全摆脱自给半自给的状态。但是，首先，自然经济不等于封建经济。自给自足的、为自己和剥削者直接消费而生产的、往往是以家庭为单位自我完成再生产过程的自然经济，它在原始社会末期就已出现。这是常识。
    而且，自然经济只是一种经济形态，它并不能随着生产方式的变革而立即消亡。十九世纪中叶的法国早已是资本主义社会，然而此时法国经济关系中，小生产的自然经济仍然占相当大的比重。而在我国，随着社会主义经济建设的发展，自给半自给的自然经济在国民经济中的比重已经而且正在越来越缩小。
    再说，尽管我国农村还存在自给半自给的自然经济，但是我国的商品经济确实有了大规模的发展。统计资料表明，全国零售商品货源，前五个五年计划期间平均以40.9％的速度发展，而“六五”计划时期比“五五”计划时期猛增88.8％。即使1978年以前，“左”的指导思想和政策也没有使我国的商品经济完全停滞不前。而十一届三中全会之后，我国商品经济的发展大大地加快了速度。随着改革、开放的深入进行，我国以公有制为基础的有计划的商品经济必将更快地发展起来。
    在我国的社会主义经济体系中，自然经济过去没有占过主要地位，今后更不可能占据这样的地位。
    他们的论据之一是认为，在中国的政治生活没有民主，只有“集权主义”，因而中国的社会主义是“封建的”。
    果真如此吗？也不然。
    这里不来详细回答有关民主的问题。民主有阶级性，世界上没有超阶级的一般的抽象的民主。在人类历史上，民主从来是以国家形态出现的。在现代国家中，不是资产阶级民主，就是无产阶级的社会主义民主。我国的社会主义民主有三个基本内容：一是国体，即工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，简言之就是劳动人民当家做主的地位；一是政体，即按照民主集中制组织起来的全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会制度，简言之就是劳动人民当家做主的形式；一是在此种国体和政体下，由宪法和法律保障的公民的基本权利和基本义务，简言之就是劳动人民当家做主的行为方式。我们不否认，我国社会主义民主的发展还很不充分。这既同党和国家领导制度上的缺陷有关，也同保障社会主义民主的法制还不健全有关。但是，我国在社会主义建设、改革开放的进展和人民生活的改善等方面所取得的举世瞩目的成就证明，我国的政治上层建筑是基本上适合社会主义的经济基础的。
    这里要再说一说党和国家领导制度上的弊端问题。提出这一论据的人说，我国曾经发生过个人崇拜现象，也存在过权力过分集中的体制和领导职务终身制等等，所有这些都是封建主义的遗毒。这些弊端是确实存在过的，现在也还没有完全克服。但是把这些现象一概说成是封建主义遗毒，却是一种臆想的武断，因为它缺乏科学的分析。不错，这些现象确有封建主义因素在其中起作用，但它不是唯一起作用的因素。比如对毛泽东的个人崇拜，革命战争年代形成的为当时所必须的权力集中，革命斗争中形成的民主传统建国以后没有进一步形成制度化的体制，毛泽东本人由于领导中国革命和建设取得伟大胜利而享有的个人威信，这些都是重要的因素。至于权力过分集中和领导职务终身制，还同过去长期革命战争和被分割的农村环境形成的领导方式和领导方法有关，也同建国初期我们照搬苏联的经验和模式有关。我们长时期认为，社会主义制度和计划管理制度要求对国家生活各方面必须实行高度集中的管理体制，而没有及时解决各级党政机构的职责、党政适当分工、个人负责制和群众监督制度等等问题。然而，自十一届三中全会以来，正是我们党提出了这些作为政治改革任务的问题，而且正在政治改革中着手解决这些问题。
    他们的论据之一是认为，我国意识形态领域里的封建主义的东西不少，或者说是有“封建主义的沉淀”，因而中国的社会主义是“封建的”。
    果真如此吗？也不然。
    我们知道，社会意识是社会存在的反映。而某种意识形态形成之后，就具有相对的独立性。意识形态的变革往往落后于社会制度的变革。这是任何社会形态下的意识形态发展的共同规律，古今中外，概莫能外。比如，欧洲中世纪占统治地位的“上帝创世说”，至今仍照样作为超自然、超社会的力量纠缠着人们的头脑。美国某些学校禁止传播达尔文的进化论，而州法官判定这种行为属于合法，就是一例。在某些发达的资本主义国家，至今还存在大量的封建迷信、宗法观念，王权思想和贵族特权等等，这是举世皆知的事实。
    我国社会主义制度建立的时间不长，存在一些封建主义的意识形态，这有什么奇怪？奇怪的倒是，仅仅根据意识形态就判定社会的性质，说得轻一点是无知，说得重一点是别有用心。
    他们还有一个论据是认为，中国的传统文化或曰“旧文化体制”，一概都是“封建主义的糟粕”，而且形成了一个所谓“封建主义的文化场”，一切新事物新思想，包括马克思主义、共产主义、社会主义、直到共产党，一旦进入这个“文化场”就注定要受到“歪曲”而“变形”，成为封建主义的“变种”，所以社会主义在中国也成了“抹上社会主义油彩的封建主义”。
    果真如此吗？也不然。
    这里且不说别的，不说他们对马克思主义、共产主义、社会主义、共产党及其领导下的中国革命（包括民主革命和社会主义革命）的否定和污蔑，也不说他们这种否定和污蔑的全部目的在于反对党的领导和反对社会主义制度，妄图把独立自主的社会主义的中国变成西方的附庸，这是有正常头脑和心理的人都能看穿的。
    这里只说一说对待我国文化传统的态度。我们中华民族有六千年的文明史，给我们留下了深厚的文化传统和文化遗产。这是我们每一个中华民族子孙都引为骄傲和自豪的。当然，两千多年的封建社会给传统文化带来了不少封建性的糟粕，这是不能忽视的。但是，把六千年的中华民族文化一概当作封建主义文化，又一概当作封建主义的糟粕，而全盘加以否定，却是不可取的民族虚无主义的态度。六千年的中华民族文化并不都是封建主义文化，这是一；六千年的文化传统固然有其糟粕部分，然而优秀的先进的带有人民性、民主性和革命性部分却是它的主要的精华的部分，这是二；对两千多年的封建主义文化，也有初期和后期之分，属于统治者的部分和属于人民的部分之分，即使属于统治阶级的部分其中也有大量接近人民而具有人民性和民主性的部分，这是三；近代中国还有以孙中山为代表的先进的资产阶级的文化传统和革命传统，自五四运动以来更有中国共产党代表工人阶级领导的以马克思主义为指导的人民大众的文化传统和革命传统，两者都继承和发扬了中华民族文化传统和革命传统的精华，这是四。对待文化传统岂能笼而统之，一概贬为“封建主义糟粕”而全盘否定。这种所谓“新思维”、所谓“文化反思”，对文化传统不作任何历史的科学的分析，难道有任何一点理性吗？这种对待中华民族文化传统的态度，不过是兜售“全盘西化”的主张而已。
      由此可见，对于主张资产阶级自由化的人来说，在社会主义和封建主义的界限问题上，他们并不是对社会历史有什么片面性的认识问题，而是打起反对封建主义旗号来否定社会主义制度，反对四项基本原则。
    对于党和国家领导制度上的弊端，对于各种体制上的缺陷，对于各种具体工作包括改革开放方面的缺点和失误，对于党内和社会生活中的腐败现象和其他不良现象，我们党不但允许、而且提倡运用教育和法律两手，进行广泛群众性的监督。但是出发点和目的必须是遵循四项基本原则，拥护而不是反对党的领导，拥护而不是反对社会主义制度，以便更好地进行改革开放。对于肃清封建主义思想残余及其影响，出发点和目的也是如此。绝不允许打起反对封建主义的旗号来推行资产阶级自由化，反对四项基本原则。
    三、识破以反封建主义为旗号、传播资产阶级自由化的伎俩
    资产阶级自由化是一个政治概念，因为它的核心是否定和反对党的领导，否定和反对社会主义制度。它的本质是要在中国复辟资本主义，把社会主义的中国变为西方的附庸。但是它作为一种思潮泛滥起来，还有其在经济、政治、文化、思想和社会生活各方面，特别是在意识形态各个领域，散播了一系列主张、观点和理论，从而在社会上制造了极大的思想混乱，毒害着人们特别是青年的心灵。就世界观而言，对社会特别是青年毒害最深的是，以“自我实现”或“实现自我价值”为中心的极端个人主义、享乐主义、拜金主义、无政府主义和崇拜西方的思想。
    应当看到，封建主义思想的残余，在今天已经和正在同资产阶级各种腐朽思想互相结合，结合的形式尽管多种多样，但都表现出特权思想、宗法关系、行帮习气作为封建主义思想残余一方，同上述极端个人主义、享乐主义、拜金主义、无政府主义和崇拜西方（特别是生活方式）思想作为资产阶级腐朽思想一方，互相交叉结合的特征。尤以“拜权主义”和“拜金主义”的结合，为其最显著的特征。一切非法经营、偷税漏税、倒买倒卖、行贿受贿、贪污盗窃、走私诈骗等等犯罪活动，无一不是这一结合的产物。
    现实向我们提出的问题很清楚，正是资产阶级自由化是封建主义思想残余和各种资产阶级腐朽思想互相结合的温床。
    主张资产阶级自由化的人站出来说，如果中国经过“完整的资本主义发展阶段”，封建主义的残余早就进入了历史博物馆。因此，要肃清封建主义遗毒，中国就必须回头“补资本主义的课”，重新走“资本主义完整发展”的道路。这个药方真是异想天开，脱离现实，无视历史到了惊人的地步。
    首先，在人类历史上，资本主义制度和封建主义制度在本质上都是人剥削人、人压迫人的制度。资本主义代替封建主义在人类历史上无疑起了非常伟大的进步作用，但是这种代替的全部历史证明，它不过是一种剥削制度代替了另一种剥削制度。封建主义对于资本主义来说，前者可以为后者服务，后者可以利用前者，它们是可以相容的。在资本主义经历了二三百年“完整发展”以后的今天，我们仍然可以从发达资本主义国家看到诸如：君主立宪制、天皇制、容克地主制、长子继承制、等级身份制、实际上的权贵世袭制、形形色色的派系关系、各种黑社会组织以及大男子主义等等封建色彩很浓的东西。
    其次，在资本主义的革命历史上，包括英国革命、美国独立革命和法国大革命等在内的资产阶级革命，的的确确起了“非常革命的作用”，“把一切封建的、宗法的和田园诗般的关系都破坏了”（见马克思、恩格斯：《共产党宣言》）。但是，究竟彻底不彻底呢？英国革命是以资产阶级和新贵族的联合专政所建立的君主立宪制来结束的，并且一直延续到今天。美国独立革命后所建的政权是大资产阶级和奴隶主的联合专政，而作为奴隶制之残余的种族歧视，不只在今天还严重存在，而且由歧视黑人发展到歧视包括美籍华人在内的一切有色人种。法国大革命对于摧毁封建制度从来是被认为最彻底的，然而随后八十年间连续出现拿破仑第一帝国、波旁王朝复辟和路易·波拿巴第二帝国，甚至今天还有穿着贵族标志服装的历代王朝分子的活动。
    再其次，在中国历史上，以孙中山为代表的先进的中国人，不但曾应用西方资产阶级社会政治学说来批判封建专制，而且还拿起武器进行辛亥革命，后来还是在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三位一体的反动力量面前遭到了失败。历史已经证明，在处于半殖民地半封建地位的条件下，中国根本不可能有什么“完整的资本主义发展阶段”。而在今天，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，只能把社会主义的中国变成西方的附庸，这是除敌对分子以外的全体中国人民所不能答应的。
    最后，社会主义制度在本质上同封建主义是根本不相容的。我们已经彻底消灭封建剥削制度，只是在意识形态领域还存在封建思想的残余。自鸦片战争以来一个世纪多的中国历史证明，只有中国共产党才高举彻底反对封建主义的旗帜。在社会主义制度已经建立的今天，也只有中国共产党能够领导中国人民把肃清封建主义思想残余的斗争进行到底。
    我们党自十一届三中全会以来，早就提出了在意识形态领域反对和抵制资产阶级和其他一切剥削阶级的腐朽思想的任务，特别是提出了在进行防止和肃清封建主义思想残余的斗争的同时，必须进行反对和抵制资产阶级自由化的斗争。
    有鉴于搞资产阶级自由化的人打起反对封建主义的旗号，而又具有极大的欺骗性和蛊惑性，我们对此必须保持清醒的头脑。无论如何，不能让他们用各种各样的说教蒙骗群众，特别是蒙骗青年。比如：把搞无政府主义当作是反对封建家长制，把搞“全盘西化”当作是反对文化专制主义，把贩卖“政治多元化”、否定党的领导和否定社会主义制度当作是反对封建专制主义。一句话，不能让他们把否定和反对四项基本原则当作是反对封建主义。对于来自资产阶级自由化的这些蛊惑性的煽动和欺骗，我们一定要提高警惕，随时给予揭穿。
