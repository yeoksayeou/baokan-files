Author: Wang Xiaowen

Edition: 6

On my desk lie two novels: *Stormy Days*, reprinted by the People's Literature Publishing House, and *Lovers in Turmoil*, recently published by Kunlun Publishing House. The author, Li Lianqing, has long been involved in diplomatic work. His name is familiar to me, but I had not read any of his literary works until now.

After reading *Stormy Days* and *Lovers in Turmoil*, I developed a keen interest in Li Lianqing's works. Later, I read some of his other literary works, such as the essay collections *Neighborhood Notes* and *Cherry Blossom Country*, the plays *Great Endeavor* and *Everlasting Spirit*, the essay collections *Lu Xun and Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange* and *Lu Xun and Japan*, and the biographical novel *Indira Gandhi*. This article is a preliminary record of my impressions.

Li Lianqing's *Stormy Days* is a novel that reflects the anti-Japanese struggle in the Su North region. It successfully employs a multi-angle, multi-faceted, and multi-layered artistic expression method, showcasing the writer's creation of a colorful group of characters and the grand intention to recreate the social landscape of that time.

"Emotional appeal" is one of the most prominent artistic features of *Stormy Days*. Although the language of *Stormy Days* is plain and restrained, and the lines used to outline the plot are often rough and simple, the "emotional elements" contained within the work are not as deceptive and confusing as in some other works. On the contrary, reading *Stormy Days*, we can clearly and strongly feel a heroic and tragic atmosphere permeating the entire work; a surging emotional wave roars through its every line. The writer, with his pen dripping with revolutionary passion, has created a group of heroic images of anti-Japanese youth, such as Xu Feng, Chen Guangyou, Guo Yun, Zhang Liu, Ji Daocheng, Wang Bin, and Yang Fuga, and depicted scenes full of legendary colors and plot suspense. The pulsating blood of these anti-war heroes and the shining of their indomitable will and noble sentiments make us resonate from within and leave a deep impression in our minds.

In *Stormy Days*, the district committee secretary Chen Guangyou is a beloved young character meticulously portrayed by the writer. He is only twenty-two years old, but the locals affectionately call him "Old Chen." In chapters such as "Cunningly Fighting the Met Family Mansion," "Surprising Attack on Xinghe Town," and "Ambush at Mazhou Village," the writer vividly and authentically depicts Chen Guangyou's calm, meticulous, and generous personality, his heroic deeds of great wisdom and courage, and his talent for commanding and strategizing. In portraying this artistic archetype, the writer adheres to the logical development of the character's personality, gradually bringing the character to life through a coherent plot and conflicts. In the work, Xu Feng and Chen Guangyou are both comrades-in-arms who share life and death and a pair of lovers who spend their days together. The writer's portrayal of their pure affection for each other and their selfless dedication to the revolutionary cause is particularly inspiring.

If we compare *Stormy Days* to a rough and bold ink painting, then *Lovers in Turmoil* can be likened to a meticulously detailed fine brush painting. The latter's main storyline is about a pair of young students, Wu Qiusuo and Shen Zongshu, from a certain city in Su North before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, their personal pursuits and fateful twists, and their eventual journey together on the revolutionary path after numerous hardships. *Lovers in Turmoil* focuses more on the emotional entanglements of Wu Qiusuo and Shen Zongshu. Wu Qiusuo comes from a scholarly family; his mother is the younger sister of the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty and is proficient in literature, with some talent; his father, Wu Wenchang, graduated from the Faculty of Literature and the Faculty of Engineering of the Imperial University of Japan, and after returning to China, first engaged in education and later in business, although his business often failed and his family gradually declined, he was still able to maintain a modest living and provide Wu Qiusuo with an education at Shanghai's St. John's University. Shen Zongshu's family is even more prominent in Su North. Her ancestors served as magistrates and prefects in the Qing Dynasty. Her father, Shen Yunqian, was a Hanlin scholar in the late Qing Dynasty, serving as a minister in the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Posts and Communications, and later resigned to return to his hometown, acquiring vast wealth and a great reputation. The writer's arrangement of their backgrounds in the novel is not entirely based on real life but contains a profound implication.

In creating archetypal characters, *Lovers in Turmoil* achieves mixed results. Looking at Shen Zongshu and Wu Qiusuo, the former's character development is clear and logical; the latter appears pale and vague. Li Lianqing's biographical literature and essays are more distinctive. They often combine narration, character portrayal, landscape painting, and commentary. Additionally, the structure, language, and themes of these works have a natural beauty that is unadorned and pure.

*Cherry Blossom Country* is a collection of essays by Li Lianqing dedicated to introducing Japan and singing the praises of Sino-Japanese friendship. This collection includes nineteen essays. In chapters such as "Beautiful Japan," "Visiting the Statue of Kobo Daishi," "Revisiting Todai-ji Temple," and "Xu Fu in Japan," the writer uses solid historical data and insightful views to trace the origins, rise, and post-war resurgence of Japan's history, seeking the sources and traces of the frequent cultural exchanges between China and Japan over the past few thousand years, and expressing the historical echo of "Heaven's favor is far-reaching, and the seventh day of the seventh month has been the same for a long time" (Xu Ying, *Sending Off the Japanese Envoy*). Although *Cherry Blossom Country* discusses Japan's politics, history, cultural relics, customs, and people, it never strays from the theme of Sino-Japanese friendship. In essays such as "Scenes of Kyoto," "Sketch of Osaka," "Pilgrimage to Nara," and "Journey to Sendai," the writer, with passionate enthusiasm and a realistic attitude, praises the virtues of the Japanese people—their diligence, endurance, wisdom, and courtesy—and affirms many aspects of Japan as a modern industrial and economic power that are worth learning from and emulating. The biographical novel *Indira Gandhi* is one of Li Lianqing's representative works in recent years. The characteristics of this biographical novel can be summarized in one word: "true"—the image is lifelike, the historical facts are authentic, the editing is meticulous, and the emotions are sincere. It also contributes to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and India.

### 丰厚·朴质·真率——李连庆作品印象

    丰厚·朴质·真率
    ——李连庆作品印象
    王啸文
    案头上放着两部长篇小说：人民文学出版社再版的《风云急》；昆仑出版社新近出版的《离乱情侣》。两部书的作者李连庆多年从事外交工作，对他的名字我并不生疏，但他的文学作品，一本也未读过。
    当我读完《风云急》和《离乱情侣》，就引发了我对李连庆作品的浓厚兴趣。后来，我又读了他另外一些文学作品，如散文集《东邻散记》、《樱花之国》，剧本《大业弥艰》、《浩气长存》，论集《鲁迅与中日文化交流》、《鲁迅与日本》，长篇传记文学《英迪拉·甘地》等等。在此仅写下这篇“初记”。
    李连庆的《风云急》，是一部反映苏北地区抗日斗争的长篇小说。它成功地运用多视角、多侧面、多层次的艺术表现方法，显示了作家创作斑斓的人物群像，再现当时社会形态的宏伟意图。
    “以情取胜”是《风云急》最显著的艺术特色之一。尽管《风云急》的语言是朴实含蓄，勾勒情节的线条也往往粗犷简洁，但是，蕴含在作品之中的“情感因子”，并不像某些作品那样波诡云谲，扑朔迷离。相反，读《风云急》，我们能清晰而强烈地感觉到，一种慷慨悲壮的情调和氛围，浸透贯穿在作品的始终；一种浓烈激越的感情波涛，汹涌澎湃在它的字里行间。作家用他饱蘸革命激情的笔，塑造了徐风、陈广友、郭云、张柳、季道成、汪斌、杨富高等一批抗日青年的英雄群像，描绘了一幅幅充满传奇色彩和情节悬念的画面。那些抗战英雄儿女们的热血的搏动，以及他们的坚韧战斗意志和高尚情怀的闪光，使我们不由得从内心产生共鸣，在脑海里留下深深的记忆。
    《风云急》中，区委书记陈广友，是作家着力刻画的一个可爱的青年形象。他只有二十二岁，可老百姓都亲切地叫他“老陈”。作品在“巧斗顾家楼”、“奇袭兴河镇”、“伏击马圩村”等章节中，对陈广友沉稳、精细、豪爽的性格，他的大智大勇的英雄行为，以及他指挥若定、巧于用兵的才华，都有精彩、真切的描绘。作家在刻画陈广友这个艺术典型时，遵循着人物性格发展的必然逻辑，在连贯的情节铺垫和矛盾冲突中，使人物形象逐渐地“立”起来。在作品中，徐风和陈广友既是生死与共的战友，又是一对朝夕相处的恋人。作家写他俩对待爱情的纯洁情愫，以及对待革命事业的无私奉献精神，是颇见神采的。
    假如我们将《风云急》比作一幅浑朴粗犷的泼墨写意画的话，那么《离乱情侣》则可喻为一幅用笔细腻精致的工笔画。后者的主线所写的是：抗日战争爆发前夕，苏北某城的一对青年学生吴求索和沈宗淑，各自的人生追求和命运波折，以及他们屡经磨难后携手走上革命道路的故事。《离乱情侣》的笔墨较多地倾注在吴求索和沈宗淑的感情纠葛上。吴求索出身书香门第，其母是清朝末代状元之妹，精通文墨，小有才气；其父吴文超毕业于日本帝国大学文学系和日本工业大学，归国后先办教育，后搞实业，虽事业屡遭失败，家道渐衰，但仍能维持小康，并提供吴求索就读上海圣约翰大学。沈宗淑的家庭则更是苏北的首富和望族。她祖上做过清朝的道台、知府。其父沈云骞是清末翰林，官至商部、邮传部侍郎和尚书，后弃官归乡，广置产业，“家藏万贯，名声大震”。作家之所以在小说中如此安排他们的身世，并不完全是以拘囿真实生活为出发点的，而是别含一番深刻的寓意。
    在塑造典型形象方面，《离乱情侣》所取得的成就是瑕瑜互见、参差不齐的。拿沈宗淑、吴求索这两个人物来看，前者性格发展的脉络清晰、合理；后者则显得苍白、模糊。李连庆的文学作品中，他的传记文学和散文，可以说是更有特色。它们常常融叙事、写人、绘景与议论于一炉。另外，这些作品的结构、语言和立意，也带有一种不假雕饰、清新淳朴的自然美。
    《樱花之国》是李连庆专门介绍日本、讴歌中日友谊的一本散文集。这本集子共收有散文十九篇。在《美丽的扶桑》、《瞻仰鉴真和尚像》、《再访唐招提寺》、《徐福在日本》等篇章里，作家以翔实的史料和精辟的见解，追溯日本的发端、兴衰和战后崛起的历史变迁，寻觅中日文化几千年来频繁交流的渊源和足迹，表达了“天眷何期远，五夕久己同”（徐凝《送日本使还》）的历史回声。《樱花之国》虽然对日本的政治、历史、文化古迹、风俗人情无所不论，却处处不离中日友好的主调。在《京都风光》、《大阪剪影》、《奈良巡礼》、《仙台记行》等游记样式的散文里，作家以奔放的热情和求实的态度，赞美了日本人民勤奋、耐劳、智慧、讲礼的美德，肯定了日本作为现代工业经济大国许多值得我们学习、借鉴的长处。长篇传记文学《英迪拉·甘地》，是李连庆近年来的代表作之一。这部传记文学的特点，可以用一个字来概括：“真”——形象的逼真，史实的写真，剪裁的认真和情感的率真。它对增进中印两国人民的相互了解和友谊，亦不无裨益。
