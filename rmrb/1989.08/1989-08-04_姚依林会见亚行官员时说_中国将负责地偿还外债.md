Vice Premier Yao Yilin today met with officials from the Asian Development Bank and said that China will definitely repay its foreign debts responsibly.

Yao Yilin, during his meeting with the delegation led by Atul K. Ahluwalia, Director of the East Asia Department of the ADB, in Zhongnanhai, said that one of the features of the Eighth Five-Year Plan for national economic development is to consider the issue of repaying foreign debts. He said that China hopes to increase its repayment capacity through increased exports.

During the meeting, Yao Yilin answered questions raised by the guests regarding China's reform and opening up. He said: Without reform and opening up, China would find it difficult to develop and progress. On this point, almost all Chinese people have reached a consensus. The question is how to better reform and open up.

Yao Yilin said: China has accumulated some experience in reform and opening up, but it cannot be said that all this experience is successful, so further exploration is needed. But one thing is certain, that is, the promotion of reform and opening up will not change the socialist nature of China's social system.

He also said that in the process of reform and opening up, foreign experiences should be absorbed "with analysis and selection" based on China's actual situation.

The delegation, invited by the People's Bank of China, will also visit Shanghai for a tour.

    姚依林会见亚行官员时说
    中国将负责地偿还外债
    新华社北京8月4日电  （记者周树春）国务院副总理姚依林今天在会见亚洲开发银行官员时说，中国一定将负责任地偿还其外债。
    姚依林在中南海会见亚行东亚国家规划局局长阿特科一行时说，国民经济第八个五年计划的一个特点便是要考虑到偿还外债的问题。他说，中国期望通过增加出口提高还债能力。
    会见时，姚依林回答了客人就中国改革开放提出的问题。他说：没有改革开放，中国难以发展和进步，对这一点几乎所有中国人都取得了共识。问题是如何更好地改革和开放。
    姚依林说：中国已积累了一些改革开放的经验，但不能说这些经验都是成功的，所以需要进一步探索。但有一点是肯定的，即推进改革开放不改变中国社会制度的社会主义性质。
    他还说，在改革开放过程中，对外国的经验要根据中国的实际情况“有所分析、有所选择地”吸收。
    阿特科一行应中国人民银行邀请来访，还将赴上海参观访问。
