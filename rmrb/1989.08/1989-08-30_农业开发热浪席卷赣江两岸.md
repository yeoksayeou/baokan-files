Jiangxi Province is rich in agricultural resources. Leveraging agricultural advantages to build the province's "economic skyscraper" on the foundation of agriculture is a key guiding principle of the provincial Party Committee and government in economic development strategy. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, while emphasizing the "painting of Jiangxi's landscape," extending the "two short legs" of diversified operations and township enterprises, last year, Governor Wu Guanzheng, on behalf of the provincial Party Committee and government, announced the launch of a comprehensive agricultural development campaign over 5-7 years. The campaign aims to mobilize the entire province to focus on developing grain, diversified operations, township enterprises, and deep processing of agricultural products. The goal is to transform medium and low-yield fields, develop barren mountains, lands, and waters, accelerate the conversion of resources and the transfer of rural labor, promote the adjustment of industrial structure and the improvement of efficiency levels, and advance agricultural industrialization, thereby elevating agricultural development to a new stage. In 1987, the province's grain production reached 15.6275 million tons, setting a historical high. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries also saw significant development. In 1988, the value of diversified operations accounted for 59.5% of the total agricultural output value. The total industrial output value of township enterprises was 4.4 times that of 1980. Since last winter, the province has seen a surge in agricultural development. The area for winter crops expanded by 3 million mu compared to the previous year, and this spring's oil and grain production both reached historical highs.

Jiangxi's agricultural development adheres to the principles of unified planning, concentrated development, local conditions, diversified operations, phased contracting, public assistance for private initiatives, and benefits to those who develop. These principles fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all levels and the broad masses. Various regions have established a number of agricultural commodity production bases. Currently, there are 430 bases established at the provincial level alone, covering 99% of the province's counties (cities and districts).

Promoting development through openness is a distinctive feature of Jiangxi's agricultural development. The provincial government has issued documents on developing inter-provincial horizontal economic cooperation, encouraging foreign investment, and providing preferential policies for out-of-province development of agricultural resources. In 1988, the province attracted 94.242 million US dollars in loans from the World Bank, of which 82.415 million US dollars, or 87.5%, were directly used for agricultural development.

    农业开发热浪席卷赣江两岸
    江西农业资源丰富。发挥农业优势，把全省的“经济大厦”建立在农业这个基础之上，这是省委、省政府在经济发展战略中的一个重要指导思想。十一届三中全会以来，在强调“画好江西山水画”、伸长多种经营和乡镇企业“两条短腿”的基础上，去年，吴官正省长又代表省委、省政府宣布，用5—7年时间，动员全省人民大打一场农业开发总体战，以发展粮食、多种经营、乡镇企业、农产品精深加工为重点，改造中低产田园，开发荒山荒地荒水，加速资源的转化和农村劳动力的转移，促进工业产业结构的调整和效益水平的提高，推进农业工业化，从而把农业开发提到一个新的阶段。1987年全省粮食产量达到1562.75万吨，创历史最高纪录，林牧副渔各业也有了长足发展。1988年，多种经营产值占农业总产值的59.5％。乡镇工业总产值比1980年增长4.4倍。去冬以来，全省农业开发热浪滚滚。冬种面积比上年扩大300万亩，今年春油春粮都创历史最高水平。
    江西农业开发，坚持统一规划，集中开发，因地制宜，多种经营，分期承包，民办公助，谁开发谁受益的原则，充分调动各级和广大群众的积极性。各地建立了一批农业商品性生产基地。目前仅省一级建立的基地就有430个，覆盖面占全省县（市区）的99％。
    以开放促开发，这是江西农业开发的一个显著特点。省政府公布了关于发展省际横向经济联合、鼓励外商投资、外地来省开发农业资源优惠办法等文件。1988年，全省已引进世界银行贷款9424.2万美元，其中直接用于农业开发的就有8241.5万美元，占87.5％。
