At the end of May and the beginning of June, a Hong Kong television station suddenly broadcasted a news item: "The following is a discussion between the heads of two Chinese private companies regarding the Beijing student movement. Their attitudes are diametrically opposed."

The screen first showed the general manager of Fourtong Company expressing support for the student movement, followed by the general manager of the South Industrial Group, Mu Zhongwei, expressing opposition and condemnation of the student movement. Moreover, Mu Zhongwei's words were sharp. He said, "For the sake of the nation and the people, the government should take decisive measures to quell the turmoil as soon as possible!"

Before the Party Central Committee and the State Council took measures to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion on June 3, it took courage to say such things!

On the evening of July 5, we met this general manager, who was referred to by Hong Kong people as "the only mainland private company that dares to publicly state that it agrees with the government."

"Our company does not support the student movement. Anyone who supports the student movement will be fired!"

"From the beginning of the student movement, I was very worried. China's reform is unprecedented. Every step forward has come at a great cost. If China falls into turmoil, the new economic order and economic environment that the Chinese people have struggled for so long and reformed for ten years will be destroyed overnight. Without reform, I, a worker, would not have become a general manager. Without reform, there would be no company with a certain degree of fame like ours. Our company is a product of reform, so I naturally oppose the turmoil. Those who truly support reform, as long as they are clear-headed, will oppose the turmoil."

The 49-year-old Mu Zhongwei told the reporter that after April 15, some people held activities in the square to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang. He did not pay much attention to it. But after the two consecutive incidents of storming Zhongnanhai on the nights of April 18 and 19, he suddenly became alert.

"The situation is developing too fast! On the afternoon of the 15th, we only learned of Yaobang's death, and by the 17th, people were already protesting on the streets. On the 18th, they stormed Zhongnanhai. There must be someone behind this! Without someone directing it, it wouldn't move so fast, would it? The more I thought about it, the more I felt something was wrong. So, on the afternoon of the 20th, it was already 4:40 PM, I suddenly announced a meeting of the staff. I stood there and spoke for 15 minutes. My words were simple: The situation in Tiananmen Square seems to be getting serious. Students want to use undemocratic and illegal methods to fight for democracy and freedom, which will definitely lead to trouble. Democracy and freedom are the products of social and economic development to a certain extent, not something that can be obtained just by wishing for it. Everything has a process, and using undemocratic methods to fight for democracy will lead to chaos. Therefore, I announced: Our company does not support the student movement and prohibits staff from supporting the student movement. Anyone who supports it will be fired!"

"I feel deeply disappointed with the 'elites'"

On the 15th of Gorbachev's visit, a few students occupied the square and went on a hunger strike on the 13th, clearly using foreigners to pressure the government, completely disregarding national interests and national dignity. Mu Zhongwei was very anxious about this.

"I thought that maybe these intellectual 'elites' have influence over the students and should be mobilized to persuade the students to leave. So, I found a scholar who was relatively familiar with me. On the 14th at noon, I had lunch with him and asked him to think of a way. My argument was sufficient: national interests should be placed first. South Korean students didn't cause trouble during the Olympics, did they!" The scholar thought for a moment and then dialed Fang Lizhi's phone.

Fang Lizhi was blunt: "Let the students cause trouble! Let the government be embarrassed!"

The scholar said: "If things go on like this, it will be uncontrollable. What if the government sends in the military?"

Fang Lizhi was very confident over the phone: "He won't dare to suppress! If the military dares to open fire, all foreign countries will withdraw their loans. Once they are blockaded, the government will collapse!" The phone was hung up.

At Mu's urging, the scholar dialed Yan Jiaqi's phone. Yan Jiaqi said on the phone: "You come quickly, we are having a meeting here, and there are many people here!" Mu accompanied the scholar to go there.

The scholar took out a letter to persuade the students to withdraw, but the "elites" present all shook their heads. They discussed and drafted, writing down the denial of the "turmoil" and support for the students, demanding that the government recognize the illegal organization, and even saying that if it did not agree, they would go on a hunger strike with the students, etc., becoming the so-called "Urgent Appeal to the Current Situation by Twelve Experts and Scholars."

Mu felt chilled, thinking that the situation was urgent, and Gorbachev would come the next day, but these people were still calculating their position in history, as if they were all destined to be recorded in history. People who are not responsible for the real interests of the nation and the people, can history give them a good evaluation?

"I sat there for 3 hours, watching them add clause by clause, and finally changing the persuasion of the students to leave the square to 'temporarily withdraw,' I knew that this attitude would only add fuel to the fire of the students, and it was impossible to persuade the students to leave! A group of elites have such a shallow understanding of democratic politics, and do not understand how to achieve democratic politics on this ancient land of China. I felt deeply disappointed. The result turned out like this, and I sadly left!"

So, he again put his hopes on the business community. He went to find Cao Siyuan of the Fourtong Research Institute, hoping that a few influential private companies in China would organize a symposium to criticize the wrong views that were rampant in Beijing's public opinion and academic circles at that time. However, his suggestion was ridiculed: "Mu, you are so confused, how can you say these things at this time?" His plan failed again.

"I told the Hong Kong reporter, Kissinger and Nixon are much smarter than you!"

"The government decided to impose martial law, I support it, I saw the hope of stability. But the military did not come in, I was anxious!"

He spoke everywhere, to the people of his own company, and to the students who came from outside, to the extent that someone wanted to come and beat him, and he had to ask three martial arts team members to "protect" him.

On May 28, Mu Zhongwei propagated his views at the Beijing Hotel. Coincidentally, a Hong Kong female reporter heard it, and the two started a debate.

Mu said: "The Chinese government has the right to impose martial law, which is in accordance with the constitution. Otherwise, the turmoil cannot be quelled, and the country will not be able to be cleaned up!"

The female reporter said: "Hong Kong has raised a large amount of funds to support the students' democratic movement. If the government dares to suppress with guns, the whole world will blockade mainland China, and the government will collapse!"

Mu said: "Kissinger and Nixon are much smarter than you. They spent so much effort to open the door to China, thinking of American interests. If Bush breaks off relations with China, it would be too shallow and shortsighted!"

"History has proven that China can only have hope through orderly reform. A small number of people want to overthrow the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, China will fall into a state of anarchy, and China will lack a core that is respected by all and has cohesion. Can the people on Tiananmen Square push out a political representative? The leaders of the Autonomous Federation of High School Students change every seven hours on average, and a right-wing slogan is overthrown by an even more right-wing slogan, just like during the Cultural Revolution, an extreme left slogan is overthrown by another extreme left slogan. A society always needs a politically dominant force. In China, I don't see any force that can replace the Communist Party. China's prosperity and progress are gradually realized through the way of reform, and reform can only be carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party."

    牢记国家和民族的利益
    ——访南德经济集团总经理牟其中
    中国青年报记者
    5月底6月初，香港一家电视台突然播放了一条新闻：下面播出的是中国两家民营公司的负责人关于北京学潮的谈话，他们的态度截然不同——
    画面上首先出现的是四通公司总经理发表支持学潮的谈话，然后是南德经济集团总经理牟其中“反对和指责学潮”的谈话。而且，牟其中的言词激烈，他说，为了国家和民族的利益，政府应尽快采取果断措施平息动乱！
    在6月3日党中央、国务院采取措施平息反革命暴乱之前，讲这种话是需要勇气的！
    7月5日晚，我们见到了这位被港人称为“大陆唯一敢于公开说明自己和政府观点一致的民营公司”的总经理。
    “本公司不支持学潮，谁声援学潮我开除谁！”
    “学潮一开始我就非常担心。中国的改革史无前例，每进一步都是付出了巨大代价的。如果中国陷入动乱，中国人民奋斗这么久，改革了十年建立起的新的经济秩序和经济环境就会毁于一旦。没有改革，我这个工人就不会成为总经理，没有改革，就没有我们这个有一定知名度的公司，我们公司是改革的产物，我当然反对动乱。真心改革的人，只要头脑清醒，都会反对动乱。”
    今年49岁的牟其中对记者说，4月15日以后，有人在广场举行悼念胡耀邦同志的活动，他没太多注意。但4月18日、19日晚连续两次发生冲击新华门事件以后，他突然警觉了。
    “事情发展太快了！15日下午才得知耀邦逝世，17日就上街游行，18号就冲新华门，这里面肯定有人捣鬼！要没人指挥，恐怕动不了这么快吧？我越想越觉得不对劲儿。于是，4月20号那天下午，都4点40了，我突然通知召开职工大会，我当时站着讲了15分钟。话也很简单：天安门的事看来要闹大。学生们要用非民主非法制的方法争民主自由，肯定要出事。民主和自由是社会和经济发展到一定程度的产物，不是光凭愿望就能得到的。干什么都要有个过程，用非民主的方式争民主，会演变出乱子来的。所以，我宣布：本公司不支持学潮，禁止职工声援学潮。谁去声援我开除谁！”
    “我对‘精英’们感到深深的失望”
    戈尔巴乔夫15日来，少数学生13号占领了广场绝食，明明白白是借外国人压政府，已经不顾国家利益和民族尊严了。牟其中对此十分焦虑。
    “我想，也许那些知识分子的‘精英’们对学生有号召力，应当动员他们把学生劝回去。于是，我就找到一位平时比较熟的著名学者。14日中午，我和他一块吃饭，请他想办法。我的论据是充分的，国家利益要摆在首位，南朝鲜学生在奥运会期间都不闹事嘛！”学者想了想，便挂通了方励之的电话。
    方励之是干脆的：“学生闹就让他们闹好了！政府难堪就让它难堪算了！”
    学者说：“闹下去不可收拾了，政府要是派军队来怎么办？”
    方励之在电话中很自信：“他不敢镇压！军队敢开枪，所有外国都会撤回贷款，一封锁，政府就得垮台！”电话就挂上了。
    在老牟催促下，学者又挂通了严家其的电话。严家其在电话中说：“你快来吧，正好我们这有个会，不少人在这儿！”老牟陪着学者一起前往。
    学者拿出一份劝学生撤退的信件来，在场的“精英”都摇头。他们议论着，起草着，写上了否定“动乱”提法，支持学生的种种内容，要求政府承认非法组织，甚至说如果不答应，他们就要与学生一起绝食等等，变成了所谓12个专家学者《我们对今天局势的紧急呼吁》。
    老牟感到心寒，他想，形势紧急，明天戈尔巴乔夫就要来了，这些人还在计较着自己在历史上的地位，似乎个个都是青史留名者。对国家和民族的现实利益不负责任的人，历史能对他有好评价吗？
    “我呆了3个小时，看他们一条一条往上加，最后又把劝学生离开广场改为‘暂时撤离’，我就知道，这种态度只会给学生火上加油，是劝不走学生的！一帮精英对民主政治的理解是这样肤浅，对在中国这块古老土地上如何才能实现民主政治根本不理解。我感到深深的失望。弄成这么个结果，我悲哀地走了！”
    于是，他又寄希望于企业界。他去找四通研究所的曹思源，希望中国几家有影响的民办公司组织一个座谈会，抨击当时充斥北京舆论界、学术界的错误观点。可是，他的建议被人讥讽：“老牟，你好糊涂，这个时候了怎么能说这些话？”他的计划又失败了。
    “我对香港记者说，基辛格和尼克松比你聪明多了！”
    “政府决定戒严，我支持，我看到了稳定的希望。可是军队没进来，我着急！”
    他到处讲，对本公司人讲，对外边来的学生也讲，以至于有人要来打他，他只好请了三个武术队的人来“保卫”。
    5月28日，牟其中在北京饭店宣传自己的观点。恰好，香港一位女记者听见了，两人辩论起来。
    牟说：“中国政府有权戒严，符合宪法。否则动乱平息不了，国家就没法收拾了！”
    女记者说：“香港已筹集了大批经费支持学生的民主运动。政府敢开枪镇压，全世界都会封锁中国大陆，政府就会垮台！”
    牟说：“基辛格和尼克松比你聪明得多。花那么大力量敲开中国的大门，是为美国利益着想的。布什要是和中国断交，就太浅薄太近视！”
    “历史已经证明中国只有通过有秩序的改革才有希望。极少数人要打倒共产党，没有共产党中国就会陷入无政府状态，中国就缺少一个众望所归、有凝聚力的核心。天安门广场上那帮人能推出一个政治代表吗？高自联的头头们是平均七小时换一次，一个右派的口号被另一个更右的口号打倒，就像文化革命中一个极左的口号被另一个极左的口号打倒一样。一个社会总需要一种占统治地位的政治力量。在中国，我看不出有一种什么力量能取代共产党。中国的繁荣和进步是通过改革的方式逐步实现的，改革只能在共产党领导下进行。”
