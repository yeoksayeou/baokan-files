Leaders from the Central Propaganda Department, the General Political Department of the PLA, and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee visited members of the reporting team on the heroic deeds of those who suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing.

Wáng Rěnzhī, Wáng Wéichéng, Zhōu Kèyù, and Lǐ Zhìjiān spoke on behalf of the Central Propaganda Department, the General Political Department, and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, respectively. They said that organizing a reporting team on the heroic deeds is a very significant task. It will have a positive impact on implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, achieving a complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, and promoting the development of socialist construction and reform.

Deputy Director of the General Political Department, Zhōu Kèyù, also visited 18 model representatives from the martial law troops. He said that the leaders of the Central Military Commission are very concerned about this activity. Comrades are all model representatives who have made contributions to suppressing the capital's riot. The Party and the people will not forget. We must remain humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and must not be carried away by flowers and applause. Chairman Deng Xiaoping praised the PLA for passing the test in suppressing the riot. I believe that comrades will also pass the test in reporting to the people of the whole country on behalf of the martial law troops, and demonstrate the spirit of the martial law troops as a "powerful, civilized, and victorious army."

Members of the reporting team expressed their determination to fulfill their mission with a heavy responsibility and return with praise, and to complete the glorious task of reporting to the people of the whole country.
