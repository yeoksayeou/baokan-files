For Your and Others' Safety
— A Glimpse of Japanese Traffic
Sūn Dōngmín

“In such a small country like Japan, where are you rushing to in such a hurry?” “A moment of carelessness, a lifetime of suffering!” — On the streets of Tokyo, you often see such slogans. During Traffic Safety Month, slogans related to traffic safety become even more prominent.

Japan is a “car society.” The number of cars owned exceeds fifty million, with the vast majority being small sedans. As the information center, financial center, and economic center, Tokyo is constantly accelerating its social pace. Over three million cars are constantly on the move, bringing convenience to social life. However, if you look at the other side of the car society, you will find that behind the vibrant and rosy appearance, there is also a long shadow: car wrecks and frequent traffic accidents. For example, Tokyo, which accounts for only 0.6% of Japan's total area, sees tens of thousands of accidents each year, with an average of fifty thousand people injured and over four hundred people killed. According to Japanese newspapers, more than five thousand people have died in traffic accidents nationwide in the first half of this year. Traffic experts estimate that the number of traffic deaths nationwide this year will again exceed ten thousand, the third time since the war, alarming that the country is facing a third “traffic war.”

In modern society, reducing traffic accidents and ensuring safety is a pressing desire for people. Statistics show that among the three main factors causing traffic accidents—vehicles, roads, and people—the human factor is the most significant, with drivers accounting for over 90%. Therefore, improving traffic regulations and educating drivers on safe driving is an urgent task.

The Japanese Road Traffic Law stipulates that for serious traffic violations resulting in major accidents, the driver will be held criminally liable (subject to punishment), civilly liable (compensate for damages), and administratively liable (prohibited from driving). To strengthen traffic safety management, a “point system” is used for drivers. From the day a driver obtains a license, the violation record starts at zero points. If there are any violations, points are added according to the regulations. Accumulating fifteen points means losing the right to drive. For violators, a settlement is conducted every three years, and depending on the situation, warnings, temporary driving bans, or license revocations are issued. The Traffic Bureau of the Police Agency has a “Driver Management Center,” where all driver-related records are input into a computer. Regardless of where the driver causes an accident, on-duty police can easily check the entire record, including any previous offenses, accurately and without error, making it difficult to escape the law.

The point system is an evaluation of a driver's driving skills and whether they follow the rules, as well as a warning to promote self-control. Officials from the management center said that drivers with six points in the past three years will be banned from driving for thirty days. However, if they voluntarily attend the safety driving courses offered by the authorities and pass the exam, not only will their previous points be cleared, but the driving ban period can also be shortened. Drivers with excellent results can have their licenses returned the same day and resume driving the next day. For drivers who have driven for a long time without accidents, not only are they awarded certificates of honor, but they also receive preferential treatment in not being penalized for minor violations. Based on my experience of driving in Japan, Japanese traffic police are strict in enforcing traffic laws and handling accidents, yet they are also courteous. Once they discover speeding or running a red light, they first hand out a printed three-part form for you to fill out, telling you which rule you violated, clearly stating the points deducted and fines, and requiring you to sign and acknowledge the violation. You are then required to pay the fine through the post office within the specified period. If you do not pay within the deadline, the police authorities have the right to take legal action.

Cars bring convenience to people, but driving a car may also take away someone's life with a moment of carelessness. Poor roads and substandard car performance may be factors in causing accidents, but fundamentally, they are all human errors. Based on this, Japan's traffic safety management departments always prioritize driver safety education and raising traffic safety awareness to minimize accidents.

     为了您和他人的安全
     ——日本交通一瞥
     孙东民
     “这么窄小的日本，您开快车急着往哪里赶？”“疏忽一秒，受害一生！”——在东京街头，常可看到这类标语。逢交通安全月，有关交通安全的标语就更加醒目了。
    日本是一个“汽车社会”。汽车拥有台数已超过五千万辆，绝大部分是小轿车。首都东京以其信息中心、金融中心、经济中心的地位，不断加快着自身的社会节奏，三百多万辆汽车南来北往，飞奔不止，为社会生活带来便利。但是，如果窥视汽车社会的另一侧面，就会发现在充满活力、泛着玫瑰色的背后，同样还有片长长的阴影：车毁人亡，交通事故频发。例如，仅占日本全国面积百分之零点六的东京，每年都出现上万起事故，平均五万人受伤，四百多人丧命。据日本报纸报道，今年上半年，全国已有五千多人死于交通事故。交通专家们估计，今年全国的交通死亡人数，仍将继去年再次突破万人大关，惊呼现在面临战后第三次“交通战争”。
    在现代社会，减少交通事故，确保安全是人们的迫切愿望。统计表明，酿成交通事故的车辆、道路和人这三大因素中，人是主要的，其中司机的因素占百分之九十以上，完善交通法规，对司机进行安全行车教育，就是刻不容缓的课题。
    日本道路交通法规定，对违章驾驶，造成重大交通事故者，按情节轻重要承担刑事责任（接受刑罚）、民事责任（交付赔偿）以及要承担行政责任（禁止开车）。为加强交通安全管理，对司机采用“分数制度”。司机自取得执照的第一天起，违章记录为零分，此后如有违章，即按规定加分，积分达十五分意味着失去开车资格。对违章者三年搞一次清算，视情况给予警告、处以一定时间的禁止开车或吊销执照处分。警察厅交通局设有“驾驶员管理中心”，所有司机的有关档案全部输入电脑，不管司机在什么地方肇事，值勤警察可轻而易举地查到是否有前科等全部记录，准确无误，可谓法网难逃。
    分数制度是对司机开车水平、是否遵纪守法的一种评价，也是促进自我节制的警告方式。管理中心的人士称，对过去三年内分数满六分者给予停开三十天的处分。但如果主动去当局开办的安全驾驶学校听课，考试成绩合格，不但可使以往的积分一笔勾销，还可缩短停止开车的期限，成绩优秀者可当天发还执照，第二天即恢复开车。对长期开车无事故的司机，不但颁发给荣誉证明，还可得到在发生小的违章事故时不予加分的优待。依笔者在日本开车的体验，日本的交通警察在取缔违章开车，处理事故中执法如山而又彬彬有礼。一旦发现超速开车或不看信号闯红灯，先掏出印制的三联单让你填写，告诉你违反哪条哪款，明确说明扣分罚款，违者认错签字划押，并要你持单在指定期限内通过邮局交付罚款。不因违章者的态度好坏有所通融或变通。如果在限期内不交，警察当局有权诉诸法律。
    汽车给人们带来便利，但驾驶汽车又可能因稍有不慎夺走人的生命。道路低劣，汽车性能不佳可能是酿成车祸的因素，但根本上都是人的失误。基于此，日本的交通安全管理部门总是把对司机的安全教育，提高交通安全意识放在首位，以期把事故降到最低限度。
