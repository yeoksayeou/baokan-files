Yugoslavia's television often airs a heartwarming image during prime time: a beating heart, with the left half filled with vibrant red blood and the right half featuring a sweet-faced young girl. The accompanying text reads: "Thank you to those who donated blood for my happy childhood." Following this, the television announces the location and time for the next day's blood donation.

Recently, a reporter visited the blood donation center on S. Sava Street in Belgrade. The center was filled with dozens of young men and women, all voluntarily donating blood. They followed the doctor's instructions to register, undergo a physical examination, and have their blood type checked. After donating blood, they would go to the cafeteria for a few snacks and a glass of fruit juice, receive a red blood donation certificate from the doctor, and then happily leave. The entire process took less than 20 minutes. Except for holidays, the blood donation center operates from morning to evening, accepting voluntary donors.

Currently, it is the summer vacation period, and the number of donors is relatively low, with several hundred people donating each day. Normally, the number can reach over a thousand. The center receives about 60,000 to 70,000 donors annually. Additionally, they send mobile teams to schools, factories, and government offices to accept donations from volunteers. According to regulations, citizens aged 18 to 65 who are in good health can donate blood. Each donation is between 250 to 450 milliliters, with a minimum interval of 3 months for men and 4 months for women between donations. Donors are advised to rest for two days after each donation.

Yugoslavia's blood donation principle is voluntary and unpaid. Dr. Krivokapic, the director of the blood donation center, explained that blood is not a commodity but a gift from the heart, its value cannot be measured by money. Promoting voluntary and unpaid blood donation is to embody and promote the spirit of mutual assistance and love among people, as well as the moral concept of altruism. Statistics show that nearly 5% of Yugoslav citizens voluntarily donate blood each year, reflecting the country's social civilization and the result of long-term propaganda and education.

Yugoslavians have a tradition of voluntary and unpaid blood donation. During the anti-Fascist liberation war, Belgrade launched the "Donate blood for the bleeding heroes" campaign, which strongly supported and inspired the people's army. After the revolution, there was a period of paid blood donation, despite the high compensation, the number of donors continued to decrease. In response to this situation, Yugoslavia switched to voluntary and unpaid blood donation in 1953.

The state's laws stipulate that citizens have the right to receive free blood transfusions but also have the obligation to donate blood without compensation. Mobilizing and organizing healthy citizens to donate blood is considered a common task for the entire society. Various levels of the Socialist Alliance have established coordination committees specifically responsible for blood donation organization. In addition to the Red Cross and healthcare institutions, various social and political organizations also promote saving lives and revolutionary humanitarianism, establishing the concept that donating blood is an honor. Republics like Serbia have designated a special day for blood donors. Ceremonies are held to commend units and individuals who donate the most blood, awarding them with commemorative badges and medals. This has gradually formed a positive atmosphere of active and voluntary blood donation. According to Yugoslav media reports, since 1953, Yugoslavia's unpaid blood donation activities have been sustained. Participants include party and government leaders, generals, university professors, engineers, and various ordinary workers, with 70% being young people and workers. Many units have spontaneously established voluntary blood donation organizations.

During the visit to the S. Sava Street blood donation center, the reporter interviewed several donors. Two of them were workers from the Belgrade Engine Factory, B. Miladin, and a mechanic from the city's transportation system, K. Milivoje. Both were in their early 30s, but their small red books recorded that they had donated blood 6 and 20 times respectively. They said that being able to donate their precious blood to fellow citizens, especially children, in times of need and save lives in danger is the greatest joy in life!

    心的赠礼！
    ——记南斯拉夫献血活动
    本报记者　严正
    南斯拉夫电视在晚上的黄金播放时间，经常播出一幅这样的画面：一颗心在搏动，左半叶是殷红的鲜血，右半叶则是一个小姑娘甜美的脸庞。画面配的文字是：感谢为我幸福的童年献血的人。接着，电视预告第二天接受献血的地点和时间。
    不久前，记者到贝尔格莱德市斯·萨瓦街献血站采访。献血站聚集着数十名男女青年，他们都是自动来献血的。他们按着医生的指示注册登记，体检验血型，抽血。然后到餐厅用上几块小点心，喝杯果子汁，把有医生证明的红色献血本装入口袋，就高兴地离去了。整个过程不到20分钟。除节假日外，献血站从早到晚接待志愿献血者。
    眼下正值暑期，献血的人较少，每天数百人，平时最多可达上千人。该站全年接待献血者六七万人次。此外，他们还派出巡逻小组直接到学校、厂矿和机关接受志愿者献血。按规定，从18岁至65岁身体健康的男女公民都可以献血，每次的献血量为250—450毫升，两次献血相隔的时间男同志不少于3个月，女同志不少于4个月，每次献血后休息两天。
    南斯拉夫献血的原则是自愿、无偿。献血站站长克里沃卡皮奇博士解释说，血不是商品，而是心的赠礼，它的价值无法用金钱衡量，提倡自愿、无偿献血，是为了体现并弘扬人与人之间互助友爱的精神以及利他主义的道德观念。据统计，南斯拉夫每年有近5％的公民自愿献血，这不仅反映了南斯拉夫的社会文明，也是长期宣传教育的结果。
    南斯拉夫人自愿无偿献血是有传统的。早在反法西斯解放战争时期，贝尔格莱德就开展过“为流血的英雄献血”运动，有力地支援和鼓舞了人民军将士。革命胜利后，曾一度实行有偿献血，尽管报酬不低，献血的人数却不断减少。针对这种情况，南斯拉夫从1953年起改行自愿和无偿献血。
    国家制定的法律规定：公民都有无偿接受输血的权利，但也有无偿献血的义务，把动员和组织健康公民献血作为整个社会都应关注的共同任务。各级社盟组织建立了专门负责献血组织工作的协调委员会。除红十字会及卫生保健医疗机构外，各社会政治组织也开展救死扶伤和革命人道主义的教育，树立献血光荣的观念。塞尔维亚等共和国还专门确定了献血者日。举行表彰大会，给献血最多的单位和个人颁发纪念章及奖牌。这样，就逐步形成了积极主动献血的良好风气。据南斯拉夫报刊记载，1953年以来南斯拉夫无偿献血活动经久不衰，参加献血的有党政领导、将军、大学教授、工程师和各种普通劳动群众，其中青年和工人占70％以上。许多单位自发建立了志愿献血者组织。
    在采访斯·萨瓦街献血站的过程中，记者询问了几位献血者。其中两位是贝尔格莱德发动机厂的工人巴·米拉丁和市交通系统的机械师科·米利沃耶，两人都只有30多岁，可是在他们的小红本子上登记着，他们已分别献血6次和20次。他们说，能将自身宝贵的东西——鲜血献给患难中的同胞特别是儿童，使垂危的生命得救，这是人生最大的乐事！
