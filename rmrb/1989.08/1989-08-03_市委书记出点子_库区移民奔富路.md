The reservoir area resettlers of Panjiakou and Dabeiting in Xian County, Hebei Province, who have long been plagued by poverty, have in the past two years found a path to prosperity through the development of cage aquaculture. The resettlers gratefully say: "This is first of all thanks to the municipal Party Secretary Liu Shanshang who gave us a good idea."

In October 1987, Liu Shanshang, the Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee, learned from a report that cage aquaculture has high returns. He immediately wrote a letter to the leaders of Xian County, suggesting that they support the resettlers in cage aquaculture. The county Party Committee and government, in the spring of the following year, raised 800,000 yuan to build a 160-acre fish farm. At the same time, they issued 490,000 yuan in low-interest loans to support four relatively poor resettler villages in starting cage aquaculture, achieving relatively high returns that year. This year, the cage aquaculture industry in the reservoir area of Xian County has rapidly spread to 15 resettler villages. It is estimated that by the end of the year, economic benefits of 1 million yuan can be achieved, with an average increase of 100 yuan per resettler.

    市委书记出点子  库区移民奔富路
    据新华社石家庄八月三日电　（通讯员杨玉满）一直被贫穷困扰的河北省迁西县潘家口、大黑汀两大库区移民，近两年靠发展网箱养鱼业走上致富之路。移民们感激地说：“这首先得归功于市委书记刘善祥给我们出了一个好点子”。
    一九八七年十月，中共唐山市委书记刘善祥，从一份材料中得知网箱养鱼效益高的信息后，当即给迁西县领导写信，建议扶持移民搞网箱养鱼。县委、县政府于去年春，筹集八十万元，建起了一百六十亩水面的养鱼场，同时，又发放低息贷款四十九万元扶持起四个较为贫困的移民村搞起了网箱养鱼，当年收到了较高的效益。今年，迁西县库区网箱养鱼业迅速扩散到十五个移民村，预计到年底可获经济效益一百万元，平均每个移民增收一百元。
