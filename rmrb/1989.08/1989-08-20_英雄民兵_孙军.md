On January 29th of this year, the village of Guqiu in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, was enveloped in deep sorrow. From the youngest children to the elderly, from local villagers to the county secretary and county mayor, thousands of people came to attend the memorial service for the core militiaman Sun Jun.

Sun Jun sacrificed his life to protect the property of the people and maintain social order.

At 3 AM on January 22nd, the world was quiet, and people were enjoying their sweet dreams. Suddenly, shouts of "Catch the thief!" woke the core militiaman Sun Jun from his sleep. He quickly got out of bed and rushed out of his home...

It turned out that villager Qian Yibing, who had woken up early, discovered someone stealing his chickens and shouted loudly.

The thief panicked and fled. The first person to hear the shouts and run over was villager Hu Jiping. Hu Jiping engaged the thief in a struggle, but was knocked down into a ditch. Just as the thief was about to stab Hu Jiping with a dagger, Sun Jun arrived. Without hesitation, Sun Jun rushed forward and tightly hugged the thief around the waist. The thief begged for mercy, saying, "Brother, show some mercy. I won't treat you badly. These chickens aren't yours, so mind your own business, or I'll send you to your grave!" Sun Jun angrily replied, "Don't try that on me! I am a militiaman, and this is exactly the kind of business I should mind!" Sun Jun tightly hugged the thief while shouting loudly, "Help! Catch the thief!"

The thief struggled desperately. During the struggle, the thief's left hand broke free, and the wildly waving dagger stabbed Sun Jun in the left side. Blood gushed out like a fountain.

The thief tried to escape, but Sun Jun held on tightly. The vicious thief stabbed Sun Jun multiple times in the abdomen and neck. In this critical moment, a few more villagers arrived, and the thief was finally captured.

Sun Jun died from excessive blood loss and could not be saved.

Sun Jun is gone, but the people of Guqiu say he is still alive. They will forever remember that Sun Jun was a good boy from a young age. When he was in school, he studied diligently. Whenever he had free time, he would help military veterans and five-guarantee households with chores like carrying water and sweeping floors. Sun Jun was skilled with his hands; he could do blacksmith work, electrical work, and even repair tractors. If anyone's electrical wiring was broken, he would come to fix it; if anyone's tractor was broken, he would go to repair it without asking for a penny. Last spring, during the farming season, Li Laoye's family hand tractor "blew a fuse," and it couldn't be fixed after a day of work. Thinking of the more than 20 mu of fields waiting to be plowed, Li Laoye was anxious. That evening, after helping a neighbor all day, Sun Jun heard his mother mention this and immediately got out of bed. He rushed to Li Laoye's house without rest, working for another 5 hours to fix the "iron ox." The engine roared to life, Li Laoye smiled, and Sun Jun's tired face lit up with joy.

When the news of Sun Jun's heroic sacrifice spread, the adults and children of Guqiu were all in deep sorrow. Li Laoye, tears streaming down his face, said, "Sun Jun did good deeds for my family, and I didn't even have a chance to thank him before he sacrificed himself..." Saying this, he couldn't hold back his tears. Li Laoye donated 100 yuan and voluntarily offered to take care of Sun Jun's parents, wife, and child who was not yet a year old. Other villagers also donated money, raising 5,000 yuan in just one week.

To commemorate Sun Jun's heroic deeds, the Shuyang County Youth League named him an outstanding league member; the county's military department recommended him for a second-class merit and called on militiamen to learn from him.

    英雄民兵——孙军
    今年1月29日，江苏省沭阳县庙头镇古丘村沉浸在巨大的悲哀之中。从刚刚懂事的小孩到白发苍苍的老人，从本村村民到县委书记、县长，上千人前来参加基干民兵孙军的追悼会。
    孙军是为保护群众财产、维护社会治安而英勇牺牲的。
    1月22日凌晨3点钟，万籁俱静，人们沉睡在甜蜜的睡梦中。突然，几声“抓贼啊！”“抓贼啊！”的喊声，把基干民兵孙军从梦中惊醒。他翻身下床，急忙冲出家门……
    原来，村民钱以兵起早，发现有人正在偷他饲养的鸡，于是大声喊起来。
    盗贼慌了，拔腿便逃。第一个闻声跑来的是村民胡继平。胡继平与盗贼展开了搏斗，结果被盗贼打倒在沟底。正当盗贼拔出匕首向胡继平刺去时，孙军及时赶到。孙军毫不犹豫地冲了上去，将歹徒狠狠地拦腰抱住。歹徒求饶说：“哥儿们，你高抬一下贵手，兄弟不会亏待你。这鸡又不是你家的，你少管点闲事，不然我就叫你上西天！”孙军愤怒地回答：“你少来这一套！我是民兵，这个闲事我偏要管！”孙军一面紧紧抱住歹徒，一面大声叫喊：“来人啦，抓盗贼啊！”
    歹徒拚命挣扎。搏斗中，歹徒的左手挣脱开了，乱舞的匕首刺进了孙军的左肋。顿时，血如泉涌。
    歹徒乘机想溜。可孙军死死攥住歹徒不放。穷凶极恶的歹徒又朝孙军的腹部、颈部连刺数刀。危急关头，又有几个村民赶来，歹徒终于被擒。
    孙军因流血过多，抢救无效，不幸牺牲了。
    孙军死了，但古丘村的人说他还活着。他们心中永远记得孙军从小是个好孩子。读书时，他学习刻苦认真，平时一有空，总爱帮助军烈属、五保户挑水扫地做好事。孙军心灵手巧，他会铁匠活，会电工活，还学会了修理拖拉机。村上哪家的电灯线路坏了，一喊他就到；谁家的拖拉机坏了，他主动去修理，一分钱不要。去年春耕时节，村里李大爷家的一台手扶拖拉机“扒了窝”，修了一天没修好。想到一家20多亩田地等着“铁牛”去耕，李大爷急得团团转。晚上，为邻居帮了一天工的孙军听妈妈说起这事，便翻身从床上起来，急忙赶到李大爷家。他不顾一天的劳累，又忙了5个小时，才把“铁牛”的病治好。马达响了，李大爷笑了，孙军那疲惫不堪的脸上也乐开了花。
    当孙军为斗歹徒英勇牺牲的噩耗传来时，古丘村的大人小孩无不悲痛。李大爷流着热泪说：“孙军为我家做好事，还没来得及感谢他，他就牺牲了……”说着说着泣不成声。李大爷捐款100元，还主动向组织表示，要照顾孙军的父母、妻子和不满周岁的孩子。其他村民也纷纷捐款，一个星期就捐款5000元。
    为表彰孙军的英勇事迹，沭阳县团委树他为优秀共青团员；县武装部给他报请了二等功，并号召民兵向他学习。　傅广超　陈松江
