The Versatility of Refrigerators

Ultra-Low Temperature Type
General refrigerators have each star level indicating they can reach minus six degrees Celsius, with a four-star level reaching minus twenty-four degrees Celsius. For special needs, Sweden has produced several ultra-low temperature refrigerators, with a lower limit reaching minus ninety degrees Celsius. These refrigerators are also equipped with audio-visual alarm meters, allowing users to know the internal operating conditions without opening the door.

Transparent Energy-Saving Type
General refrigerators require opening the door to check the freezing and refrigeration status, which consumes electricity and affects food. Recently, Japan has introduced a new type of refrigerator with a transparent door, overcoming the aforementioned issues and gaining popularity among customers.

Multi-Power Portable Type
Conventional refrigerators are not easily moved, so they are often placed in a fixed location. For convenience in home use and outdoor activities, the Soviet Union has recently launched a multi-power portable refrigerator that is well-received. This refrigerator can use household AC power, dry cell batteries, or high-pressure gas cylinders as power sources.

Non-Electric Type
Electric refrigerators, electric refrigerators—can they work without electricity? Surprisingly, a non-electric refrigerator has already appeared in Switzerland. It does not use a motor or compressor but relies on chemical ammonia for cooling.

This new type of refrigerator uses a cooling system with a water tank containing thirty-five percent ammonia. Through the natural circulation of the heat flow tube, it achieves the cooling effect. It does not use freon, which is significant for protecting the ozone layer.

     冰箱花样多
     超低温式
    一般冰箱，每个星级表示可达到零下六摄氏度，四星级为零下二十四摄氏度。为了特别需用，瑞典已生产出几种超低温冰箱，下限可达零下九十摄氏度，并且装有声光报警仪表，可不用开箱，便能知道内部运行情况。
    透明节电式
    一般冰箱要开门才知道内部冷冻，冷藏状态，既耗电、又对食品有影响。日本最近推出一种新冰箱，门是透明的新款式，克服了上述通病，颇受顾客青睐。
    多电源便携式
    常用冰箱怕搬动，只好择优定点使用。为方便家用，又可外出使用，苏联新近投放市场多电源便携式冰箱深受人们欢迎。它既可以用家里的交流电，又可用干电池，还可用高压气体圆器作电源。
    不用电式
    电冰箱，电冰箱，不用电还行吗？偏偏就有不用电的冰箱已在瑞士问世了。它不用电机，也不用压缩机，而是用化学铵来制冷。
    这种新款电冰箱制冷系统是靠装有含有百分之三十五的铵的冷水箱，通过热流螺管的自然循环而作用的。不用氟利昂，对保护臭氧层也是有意义的。
