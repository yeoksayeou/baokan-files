A Basic Estimate

Wang Pei

A malicious slogan used by a few people with ulterior motives to attack the Party is, "The Communist Party is rotten to the core!" In fact, anyone with a basic understanding of politics can see that this slogan is untenable.

First, there is no such thing as a purely pure entity in the world, and the Communist Party is no exception. There are indeed instances of corruption among some Party members and Party leaders, and some of these cases are quite severe. This is a fact. However, when evaluating a party, the key is to look at the mainstream and the whole picture. Consider this: on the battlefield of defending the motherland, how many Communist Party members have sacrificed themselves; in times of disaster relief and emergency rescue, how many Party members have stepped forward; in reform and opening up and economic construction, how many Party members are active on the front lines; in our heroes, models, and advanced individuals across all fronts, what proportion are Communist Party members; wherever there are difficulties and dangers, there are Communist Party members. Isn't this a fact? How can we deny the contributions of so many Communist Party members just because there are a few bad apples within the Party?

Second, the Party is aware of the corruption that exists among some Party members and Party leaders and has been relentlessly fighting against it. In recent years, the judicial authorities have handled several major cases, and in almost all cases involving Party members and Party leaders, the vast majority of Party organizations have fully supported these efforts. The fact is, our Party requires that all levels of Party organizations not only should not shield law-breaking and disciplinary Party members and cadres, but also should actively cooperate with the judicial authorities in investigating and handling major cases. Isn't this a fact?

If we do not approach this with prejudice, and based on the facts mentioned above, can we not form a correct basic estimate of the Party?

    一个基本估计
    王培
    极少数别有用心的人攻击党的一个最险恶的口号，就是“共产党烂透了！”其实稍微有点政治常识的人都可以看出，这个口号是站不住脚的。
    第一，世界上绝对不存在纯而又纯的事物，共产党也不例外。在某些党员和党的领导干部中确实存在着腐败现象，有的还相当严重，这是事实。但是，看一个党，关键要看主流，要看整体。试看，在保卫祖国领土的战场上，有多少共产党员牺牲；在抗灾抢险的危险关头，有多少党员挺身而出；在改革开放和经济建设中，活跃在第一线上的又有多少共产党员；我们各条战线的英雄模范先进人物中，共产党员占多么大的比例；哪里有困难有危险，哪里就有共产党员，这难道不是事实吗？怎么可以因为党内有极少数败类，就否定了那么多共产党员？
    第二，对某些党员和党的领导干部中存在的腐败现象，我们的党是有警觉的，并与之作了不懈的斗争。近年来司法部门查处了一些大案要案，其中凡涉及党员和党的领导干部的，绝大多数党组织是全力支持的。事实是，我们的党要求各级党组织不仅不应包庇违法乱纪的党员、干部，而且还应主动配合司法部门对某些大案要案的侦破和处理工作，这也是事实吧。
    如果不抱偏见，从上述的事实出发，我们难道不可以对党有一个正确的基本估计吗？
