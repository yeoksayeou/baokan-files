Title: A Japanese Person Reads "Fortress Besieged"

In any sense, China is a great country. Great countries often produce extraordinary individuals. The author of this novel, Qian Zhongshu, is indeed a master. Even when compared to figures like Voltaire and Boccaccio, he would not be outshone; however, for well-known reasons, his extraordinary talent was not fully realized. This is an irreversible loss.

Fortunately, this novel, "Fortress Besieged," allows us to glimpse the author's great talent, and it was completed in his early years. The work was written in 1946 when the author was 36 years old, and its title is derived from the French phrase "fortress besieged." The author uses this metaphor to convey multiple layers of meaning, which are difficult to express precisely in Japanese. In our translation, we had to focus on "marriage" and chose the somewhat awkward title "Marriage Fantasia." The modern form of "marriage"—the union and separation of men and women—is just one aspect of the original work, but it is indeed one of the themes. This inappropriate translation requires a special apology to the original author. If we were to translate "Fortress Besieged" or even "Fortress Besieged" literally, it might not feel familiar to most Japanese readers who enjoy novels. Incidentally, "fantasia" refers to a free-form fantasy based on national melodies, where musical imagination develops according to one's interests.

This novel begins in the summer of 1937 when the protagonist returns to Shanghai after four years of studying in Europe, and it ends in the autumn of 1938 when the protagonist travels from Shanghai to Hunan, works at a university for less than a year, gets married, and returns to Shanghai. The novel uses the backdrop of Japan's invasion and the war to depict the sorrow, absurdity, and foolishness of the entanglements among journalists, university professors, and other middle-upper class intellectuals, both men and women. Despite being written in an unparalleled time of turmoil and crisis, the author seems to be comfortably seated in an armchair, smoking a "superior Havana," allowing readers to enjoy the novel's charm in a relaxed and leisurely manner. It can truly be said to be one of the few literary masterpieces of modern and contemporary China. Mr. Qian has recently published the monumental work "Guanzhai Bian," which is written in the form of Chinese-style "notes"—reading notes. It faithfully inherits the Chinese academic tradition of not constructing systems. Complete classical education in his motherland, combined with a command of English, American, German, French, Italian, Greek, and Latin languages and knowledge, such an existence is perhaps rare in Chinese cultural history.

This person, who is significant to the world and reads everything, if he were to write another novel, what would it be like? In the past, there was an evaluation of the works of the poet Du Fu that "not a single character lacks origin." Qian Zhongshu's novel can also be understood in this way. But just as one does not need to understand all the allusions to read Du Fu's poetry, one does not need prior knowledge to read this novel. The book is filled with the scholarly atmosphere of a bookworm, all clever and humorous, and witty remarks are integrated throughout the entire work, like underground water silently flowing, carrying the author's sincere and warm feelings.

I had the ambition to translate this work 30 years ago. The manuscript went through several rounds before it was included in the Iwanami Bunko series. However, in the final proofreading stage, it was unusually delayed for more than six years. This was entirely due to my laziness. Over the past ten years, I have been continuously encouraged by Mr. Suzuki Tsune of Iwanami Shoten. I really do not know what to say to express my gratitude to him.

According to the original author's opinion, the translation was based on the new edition (1980, Beijing People's Literature Publishing House). Some witty remarks that alternate between Chinese and English were too difficult and troublesome to handle, so I dared to translate them based on the first edition. This book has several foreign language translations internationally, and the translator referred to them during the translation process.

Additionally, in the magazine "Typhoon" that I edited, a large number of materials related to understanding "Fortress Besieged" and the author's recent academic works were published in installments. These are all deeply interesting documents that observe and analyze the author from multiple angles.

### 一个日本人看《围城》

    一个日本人看《围城》
   （日）荒井健文  李洪岩译
    无论从哪种意义上讲，中国都是一个大国。大国里经常会出现不同寻常的人物。这部小说的作者钱钟书确实是位巨匠。即便与波罗海斯、巴夫琴等人相比，照理也毫不逊色；但是由于众所周知的原因，其旷世才能未能充分发挥。这已成无可挽回的损失。
    然而不幸中的大幸是，这部《围城》足以窥见作者大才之一斑却得以在作者早年完成。作品于1946年作者36岁时执笔，书名来自法语“被围困的城堡”。作者借用这个比喻实际有多层含义，在日语中难以找到确切的词表达；不得已，我们在翻译中只好把焦点集中到“结婚”上，采用了“结婚狂诗曲”这样一个有些拙劣的译名。“结婚”的现代形态——男女离合，虽然不过是原作的一个层面，但毕竟是作品的一个主题。这种非礼的拙译，必须特别向原作者表示歉意。如按“围城”乃至“被围困的城堡”的译名译出，恐怕对多数喜欢小说的日本读者来说，不会感到亲切吧！顺便提一句，“狂诗曲”是指基于民族旋律，音乐想像力随兴趣发展的自由形式的幻想曲。
    这部小说从书中主人公结束四年欧洲留学生活回到上海时的1937年夏天开始，到1938年秋，主人公从上海旅行到湖南，在大学工作不到一年之后结婚，重返上海。小说以日本侵略与战祸为舞台背景，将新闻记者、大学教授及其他中上层知识分子男男女女的悲哀、可笑、愚蠢的纠葛，自始至终以冷峻俏皮、超然而又绚丽的笔致描绘出来，尽管作者是在无与伦比的动乱时期与危机状况下执笔创作的，却似乎稳坐在安乐椅上，吸着“上等哈瓦那”一般，让人们轻松、悠闲地欣赏小说的趣味。真可以说是现当代中国少有的文学巨制。钱先生近有巨作《管锥篇》，是以中国式的“札记”——读书笔记的形式写成，忠实地承袭了中国不构筑体系的学术传统。完整的母国古典修养，加之集于一身的英、美、德、法、意、希腊、拉丁等语文和学识，这样的存在，也许是中国文化史上少有的吧。
    这位对世界有意义的、作者无所不读的人物，如果能再写出小说会是什么样子呢？过去对诗圣杜甫的作品有“无一字无来历”的评价。钱钟书的这部小说，也可以准此而行。但正如读杜诗不必理解全部典故也能读懂一样，读这部小说也不须有预备的知识，因为书中洋溢着学者书卷气全都机智幽默和连珠妙语融汇到了全篇之中，好似地下水默然流淌着作者真诚而温暖的感情。
    我有志于翻译这部作品是在30年前。译稿几经周转才入岩波文库。但在译稿的最后检查阶段，又违反常规地耽误了六年多。这完全是由于我的怠惰所致。近十年当中，我一直受到岩波书店铃木稳氏的不断鼓励，真不知该说些什么才感谢他。
    按照原作者意见，翻译底本采用了新版（1980，北京人民文学出版社）。有的汉语、英语交替使用的俏皮话，因为过于难办和麻烦，斗胆按初版译出。本书在国际上有数种外文译本，译者在翻译时曾予参照。
    另外在译者经办的杂志《飚风》上，陆续刊载大量有关了解《围城》及作者近来学术著作的资料。这些全是对作者进行多侧面的观察分析的趣味深远的文献。
