“Better to be a donkey on South Mountain than a fisherman on the North Sea.” This is a widely circulated proverb in the coastal areas of Jiaodong. Fishing is hard and dangerous, with frequent occurrences of people disappearing without a trace.

Despite this, whether driven by necessity or lured by the blue expanse that covers two-thirds of the Earth's surface, there are still many who dive into the blue embrace.

Shaoyuanjie is one of them.

**The Ship Does Not Arrive at Bremen**

On a day in mid-August 1985, in the port of Bremen, the second-largest port in the Federal Republic of Germany after Hamburg, groups of Bremen residents gathered at the dock, pointing and whispering about a fishing vessel in the harbor. Even the local television crew had their cameras focused on the ship. What had attracted the attention of the Bremen residents, who had seen much of the world?

Oh, it turned out to be a group of Chinese people from the other side of the Pacific Ocean.

In the harbor, a fishing vessel was undergoing a handover ceremony. A flag with an eagle (the national flag of the Federal Republic of Germany) was slowly lowered, and a five-star red flag was slowly raised. Thirty-three Chinese crew members stood in a row on the deck, saluting the five-star red flag.

Leading them was a middle-aged man in his forties, a typical rugged man from Shandong, with a distinctive square face, thick and long eyebrows, and sharp, eagle-like eyes that exuded authority and confidence. His face, covered with a beard, was shaved clean. He was Shaoyuanjie, the director of the newly established Yantai Far-off Sea Fishery Company's Far-off Sea Office.

Shaoyuanjie was born in a fishing village on the coast of Jiaodong. At the age of 15, he was lured by the boundless blue sea in front of his door and enrolled in the Yantai Fisheries School. Three years later, he plunged into the blue embrace, working as a sailor, boatswain, and chief mate. In 1985, he was ordered to establish the Yantai Far-off Sea Fishery Company. Today, as he led the team to Germany to take over the ship for the first time, his heart was filled with excitement. Standing on the deck, looking at the five-star red flag being raised for the first time on the far-off sea fishing vessel, his eyes welled up with tears of excitement. Before him, a page in the history of China's far-off sea fishery remained unturned.

In the early 1960s, the beloved Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the direction of China's fishery industry was to develop towards the open sea and the far-off sea. At that time, the far-off sea fishing grounds were still the domain of aquatic creatures, with humans rarely venturing in. We were not late in starting, but due to well-known reasons, we created a red ocean and neglected the blue ocean.

Twenty years passed in the blink of an eye. When we woke up, those developed countries that had taken the lead had already made far-off sea fishing account for 40% to 50% of their entire fishery industry, while we, far-off sea fishing, was still a zero.

Today, he was here to realize the breakthrough of this zero, to the Federal Republic of Germany to purchase this large far-off sea fishing vessel. The informed far-off sea fishing developed countries issued news or comments one after another: "Even if China purchases advanced fishing vessels, it will not be able to enter the far-off sea fishing grounds." Some even claimed: "It will be difficult for the Chinese to sail the ship from Bremen back to a Chinese port."

Indeed, Shaoyuanjie and the 33 Chinese crew members had just stepped off small fishing boats with a few hundred horsepower and onto this advanced fishing vessel equipped with satellite navigation, electronic fish-finding, and comprehensive processing. Everything was so new and unfamiliar. Could they handle it?

"We invented the compass, and we will definitely be able to sail this ship," Shaoyuanjie said to the crew.

On September 15, 1985, the fishing vessel named "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" sailed back to the port of Yantai after 38 days and a voyage of 12,000 nautical miles, marking a new chapter in the history of China's far-off sea fishery.

**Riding the Waves of the Bering Sea**

The Bering Sea is located at the northern end of the North Pacific. On this high-latitude sea surface, strong winds, storms, and thick fog are frequent visitors. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes also often occur in this area. Last year, a 5,000-ton foreign fishing vessel mysteriously disappeared here, with no trace of life or death. The Bering Sea, along with the Bay of Biscay in the Atlantic Ocean and the Cape of Good Hope in the Indian Ocean, is known as one of the "four great graveyards" for sailors.

In mid-December 1987, Shaoyuanjie was leading the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" and "No. 2" in the Bering Sea when a rare storm approached them with ferocity.

The wind howled and roared, whipping up waves over 20 meters high that crashed onto the fishing vessel. The wave crests rolled over the top of the bridge, twisting the thick triangular iron welded searchlight frame into a spiral. The foghorn on the foremast and the navigation light on the top of the bridge were knocked into the water. The thick glass windows were shattered, and the 3,500-ton fishing vessel was tossed violently from side to side, up and down. People could not stand, and everyone was thrown to the deck. Suddenly, an ominous creaking sound came from somewhere.

These fishermen were all born and raised at sea, having weathered countless storms and waves, but facing this unprecedented storm, they were all stunned, not knowing who was crying in fear.

Ah! Forgive them! Not only were the young men experiencing this for the first time, but even Shaoyuanjie, with nearly 30 years of sea life, was experiencing this for the first time.

At this moment, countless eyes were fixed on Shaoyuanjie. The safety of two ships and the lives of over a hundred people depended on him! He was the sea spirit, the sea god!

Seeing the terrified faces of the young men, Shaoyuanjie, who had just stepped down from the command platform, casually grabbed a deck of cards and called out, "Come on, guys, let's play a game!"

What? In this life-or-death situation, he wanted to play cards? The young men looked at each other, doubting if their ears were playing tricks on them.

"Come on, guys, let's play a game!" Shaoyuanjie repeated.

Indeed, the manager wanted to play cards with them. Usually, they were busy with sea production, and the manager had no time. Today—. The young men were excited, tying themselves to the table legs (the table was fixed).

"Old K!" "Commander!" What a card game! They forgot the danger in front of them and relaxed their tense nerves.

"Ha... we won!" Shaoyuanjie's rough laughter drowned out the roar of the waves.

The storm raged for three days and three nights, and they fought on the sea for three days and three nights. The fierce Bering Sea finally surrendered, gently tapping the Chinese fishing vessel with small waves, sighing, "Well done, Chinese ship!"

The North Pacific fishing grounds are rich and generous, but for the newly arrived Chinese fishing vessels, they seem so stingy.

In late September 1987, the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" arrived at the North Pacific fishing grounds for the fourth time. Due to unfamiliar sea conditions, the previous catches were not significant, and this time, the catches were still meager for several days in a row.

Several times, the electronic fish-finding device clearly showed a dense school of fish, but when the net was hauled in, there were no fish. The sailors were so frustrated that they stomped their feet. What was the problem?

Shaoyuanjie, who usually boasted of having a good appetite, suddenly seemed to have developed anorexia, losing his appetite and often staring at the sea chart, sometimes sitting in the bridge for half a day. Later, his gaze fell on the net position indicator showing the depth of the net in the water. The fish school was vertically distributed in the water, while the net in the water had a certain inclination. Could it be that the net position indicator had an error? He shared his thoughts with others.

"Such an advanced fishing vessel, could the net position indicator have a problem? What a joke!" Many people did not believe his judgment.

"You rest for a while, I'll take this net," Shaoyuanjie decisively told the on-duty captain. Shaoyuanjie's stubbornness was well-known; once he made up his mind, he would not give up.

"Bridge, attention, lower the net position by 15 meters, lower..." The loudspeaker transmitted Shaoyuanjie's hoarse and powerful voice.

The entire afternoon, Shaoyuanjie explored in the bridge, finally determining the actual error of the net position indicator. At 5 PM, just before the net was hauled in, Shaoyuanjie, who had been standing for the whole afternoon, was too tired to stand. His colleagues urged him to go back to the cabin to rest.

The net was hauled in. The steel cable was taut, a good sign!

The net bag emerged from the water, a huge net head! The net bag, filled with fish, was dragged onto the stern deck like a long dragon. After measurement, this net caught nearly 90 tons of fish.

The first big net head in the history of Yantai Far-off Sea Fishery! The sailors climbed onto the net bag, cheering, jumping, and hugging each other in joy. Many old sailors had never caught so many fish in one net in their lives, and they were so excited that they wiped tears from their cheeks. The first cheer of Chinese sailors echoed over the public sea fishing grounds of the North Pacific! At this moment, the overly fatigued Shaoyuanjie collapsed in the cabin, unable to share the joy of victory with everyone.

Then, the second net caught over 120 tons! The third net caught over 130 tons!

The "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" operated in the public sea fishing grounds of the North Pacific for 108 days, catching over 5,900 tons of fish, achieving a production value of 1.92 million US dollars. The China Fisheries Corporation sent a congratulatory telegram, and the Chinese Fisheries Representative Office in the United States also sent a congratulatory telegram, celebrating the historic victory of the Yantai Far-off Sea Fishery Company in the public sea fishing grounds.

With the spread of the victory news, Shaoyuanjie's nickname also spread among the crew—"Fishery God."

**The "United Nations" at Sea**

Chinese, Americans, Germans, Japanese, Mandarin, English, German, and Japanese. After the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" entered the American economic zone for operations, there were people from four countries on the ship, speaking four different languages. On the hundred-meter-long fishing vessel, it was like a "United Nations" at sea.

There was an American representative from a joint venture company on the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1." This gentleman claimed to have worked on ships in several countries and often spoke rudely and arrogantly. According to the regulations, all foreign fishing vessels operating in the American economic zone must buy fish from American fishing vessels and then process and sell it on the ship. The Chinese "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" also had to do this. Buying fish at sea, it was impossible to weigh it, so the joint venture company representative was responsible for measuring it. The fish net was cylindrical in shape, with varying diameters and thicknesses, and the density and specific gravity of the fish at the head and tail of the net were different. However, this joint venture company representative measured the diameter as the thickest, the density as the densest, and the measured quantity was more, while the actual quantity was less, clearly favoring the American fishing vessels. The Chinese crew members were dissatisfied and angrily pointed out that his measurement method was not scientific. He shook his head like a peddler's drum: "No! No! No! I have worked on ships in many countries, and this is the way to measure." He often walked into the bridge and casually fiddled with the ship's equipment. The Chinese crew members proposed that he should compensate for any damage to the equipment, but he arrogantly said, "My monthly salary is worth more than the entire ship's salary." The implication was—he could afford it.

Would we just take this silent loss? Would we just take this humiliation!

"No, comrades, when dealing with such people, we must be reasonable, beneficial, and restrained!" Shaoyuanjie patiently reminded everyone.

One evening, Shaoyuanjie invited this representative to sit down for a negotiation. Shaoyuanjie pointed out his measurement method for the net bag and his indiscreet behavior in life, one by one, with righteous indignation. His powerful speech was like a machine gun, with each word and sentence ringing clearly. The negotiation lasted from 7 PM to 1 AM. Finally, Shaoyuanjie sternly pointed out, "As a representative of the joint venture company, I do not hope that you will favor any side, but only hope that you can be fair. Unfortunately, you have not done so. Your irresponsible work attitude has caused us economic losses, and your indiscreet behavior in life has hurt the feelings of the Chinese crew members. You are responsible for this. I will also report your situation to your boss."

The representative, who was usually rude and arrogant, seemed to realize the seriousness of the problem at this moment, like a deflated balloon, standing there in a daze with nothing to say.

The next day, the representative changed his previous measurement method and proposed to be friends with Director Shaoyuan. He privately told the translator, pointing his thumb up, "Your Director Shaoyuan, he's tough!"

There were conflicts and struggles, but there was also unity and friendship. The vast majority of foreigners and Chinese crew members formed deep friendships.

A German fish fillet processing technician named Yogen worked on the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1." He had a big beard and was very particular about quality. Once, he found that a crew member was not responsible for the quality of the fish fillets and threw a fish at that crew member. Some workers could not understand and reported it to Shaoyuanjie. Shaoyuanjie, on the one hand, patiently persuaded everyone to focus on improving the quality of the fish fillets, and on the other hand, through the translator, tactfully pointed out Yogen's inappropriate methods. The entire ship worked together to steadily improve the quality of the fish fillets. Some domestic fishing vessels were forced to stop processing fish fillets due to poor quality, but the fish fillets of the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" were well-received in the international market. Foreign merchants sent a telegram: "The fish fillets from Yantai, we want as many as you have." Seeing the telegram, Yogen and the crew member who had been hit by the fish both smiled knowingly. On the ship, Shaoyuanjie also celebrated the 44th birthday of the German technician Bader according to Chinese customs.

The fourth voyage ended, and the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" was about to return to the country. Yogen and others held Shaoyuanjie's hand, reluctant to part, saying, "Mr. Shaoyuan, in the next voyage, we will still work on your ship and travel to your Yantai."

Shaoyuanjie laughed heartily, "Welcome! Welcome!"

The winter night of the North Pacific quickly drew its black curtain, and the vast sea and the endless night merged into one. The scent of dishes wafted in the wind. Oh, today is January 1, 1988.

In the largest room on the ship—the crew dining hall—Shaoyuanjie arranged a special evening show—a North Pacific Night Music Festival, inviting many foreign crew members to participate.

There were no jazz drummers, no electric bands. The engine was their chord, and the waves were their accompaniment. American fishing songs, Japanese net-pulling tunes, Chinese sailors' "Oh, Sea, My Hometown," and the young men's vigorous sea disco. Sing, dance, on the distant North Pacific, joy can forget homesickness, joy can overcome loneliness. The sea, mankind's homeland, only those who have sailed through the wind and waves have the right to sing loudly and jump freely on this magnificent stage.

The sea is blue, and Shaoyuanjie's dream is also blue.

The blue dream of his childhood is becoming a reality. In the three years since the establishment of the Yantai Far-off Sea Fishery Company, it has grown from small to large, now owning two large trawler processing ships and a 4,000-ton refrigerated transport ship, with fixed assets of 50 million yuan, forming a complete far-off sea fishery production system from catching and processing to refrigerated transportation, becoming one of the largest and most profitable far-off sea fishery companies in the country.

Last September to this June, Shaoyuanjie led the "Yantai Far-off Sea No. 1" and "No. 2" on their fourth expedition to the North Pacific fishing grounds, lasting nine months, catching and processing 22,466 tons of fish, achieving a production value of 39.28 million yuan, and creating foreign exchange of 6.51 million US dollars for the country, setting a record for the best voyage in the history of China's far-off sea fishery. The two ships achieved an average production value of 190,000 yuan per person over nine months, setting a record for the highest production value in China's far-off sea fishery.

The news shocked the entire fishery industry. After returning to the country, visits from all sides made him overwhelmed, and he felt more tired than during the tense sea operations. One afternoon, he dozed off on his desk and had a dream:

He dreamed of a thousand sails competing, a hundred boats vying for the lead, a powerful fishery fleet with five-star red flags hoisting anchors and ready to set sail, heading for: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean...

In his dream, he raised his arm and shouted, "Weigh anchor! Set sail!"

    远洋渔歌
    〔报告文学〕
    孙为刚
    “宁上南山当驴，不下北海打鱼。”这是胶东沿海一句流传很广的民谚。打鱼苦，且险，生不见人、死不见尸的事时有发生。
    尽管如此，或为生计所迫，或为那占地球面积2／3的蓝色所诱惑，还是有不少人扑进这蓝色的怀抱。
    邵元杰便是其中的一个。
    接船不来梅
    1985年8月中旬的一天，联邦德国仅次于汉堡的第二大港——不来梅港。
    三五成群的不来梅市民聚集码头，对着港湾中的一艘渔轮指指点点，交头接耳，当地电视台的记者也把镜头对准了这艘渔轮。不来梅的市民是见过大世面的，是什么吸引了他们？
    哦，原来是一群来自太平洋彼岸的中国人。
    港湾里的一艘渔轮上，正在进行一场交接船仪式，一面老鹰旗（联邦德国国旗）缓缓降下，一面五星红旗冉冉升起。33名接船的中国人列队肃立在甲板上，向着五星红旗行瞩目礼。
    为首的是个40多岁的中年人，典型的山东大汉块头，一张极富个性的方脸，两条卧蚕眉又黑又长，一双鹰隼般的锐眼威严、自信，长满络腮胡须的脸刮得铁青，他就是新成立的烟台远洋渔业公司远洋办公室主任邵元杰。
    邵元杰出生在胶东沿海一个渔村，15岁那年，为家门口那无际的蓝色所诱惑，考入了烟台水产公司技校。3年后他扑进了这蓝色的怀抱，干过水手、水手长、大副。1985年，他奉命组建烟台远洋渔业公司。今天第一次带队出国接船，心情显得格外激动。站在甲板上，望着远洋渔轮上第一次升起的五星红旗，他的眼里闪着激动的泪花，眼前忽又浮现出共和国远洋渔业史上那未曾揭开的一页。
    60年代初期，敬爱的周总理就指出，中国渔业的方向是向外海、远洋发展。那时，远洋渔场还是水族们的一统天下，人类极少涉足。我们当时起步并不晚，但是由于众所周知的原因，我们制造了红海洋，冷落了蓝海洋。
    弹指一挥20年，当我们醒悟过来的时候，那些捷足先登的发达国家，远洋渔业已占整个水产业的40％—50％，而我们，远洋渔业还是个零。
    今天，他就是为了实现这零的突破，来联邦德国购买这艘大型远洋渔轮的。消息灵通的远洋渔业发达国家纷纷发表消息或评论：“中国即使购买了先进的渔轮，也开不进远洋渔场。”有的甚至断言：“中国人很难把船从不来梅开回中国港口。”
    是啊，邵元杰和前来接船的33名中国船员，刚刚走下几百马力的小鱼船，走上这卫星导航、电子探鱼、综合加工的大型先进渔轮，一切都是那样新鲜陌生，他们能驾驭得了吗？
    “我们的祖先发明了指南针，我们也一定能驾起这条船。”邵元杰对大伙说。
    1985年9月15日，这艘命名“烟远一号”的渔轮，在33名中国船员的驾驶下，经历千辛万苦，历时38天，航程12000海浬，终于胜利驶回烟台港，揭开了我国远洋渔业史上崭新的一页。
    弄潮白令海
    白令海，位于北太平洋北端，在这块高纬度的海面上，强风暴和大雾是常客，火山爆发、地震海啸也时常光顾这块地方。前年，一艘5000吨级的外国渔轮在这里神秘失踪，生不见人，死不见尸。白令海，与大西洋的比斯开湾、印度洋的好望角等，同称世界海员的“四大坟墓”。
    1987年12月中旬，邵元杰正率领烟远一号、二号在白令海作业，一场少有的大风暴气势汹汹地向他们袭来了。
    风，呼啸着，吼叫着，掀起了20多米高的狂浪扑向渔轮。浪峰从驾驶室顶棚滚过，粗壮的三角铁焊成的探照灯架被扭成了麻花，前桅杆上的汽笛和驾驶室顶棚的航行灯被打落水中，厚厚的舷窗玻璃被击碎，3500吨的渔轮被打得左右大幅度摇晃，上下颠簸，人们站立不住，全被摔倒在甲板上。忽然，不知什么地方发出“嘎吱嘎吱”的可怕的响声。
    这批渔民都是海里生、海里长的，不知经过多少惊涛骇浪，但面对这从未经历的风暴，全懵了，不知是谁吓得呜呜哭泣起来。
    啊！原谅他们吧！不要说第一次出远洋的小伙子们，就是有着近30年海上生涯的邵元杰也是第一次经历这样的场面。
    此时此刻，多少双眼睛注视着邵元杰，他身上系着两条船的安危，连着100多人的性命！他就是海魂，就是海神！
    看着几个小伙子惊恐的面孔，刚走下指挥台的邵元杰随手抓过一把扑克牌，招呼他们：“来，小伙子们，来一把！”
    什么？在这生死未卜危急关头，还要打扑克？小伙子们你看看我，我看看你，怀疑是不是自己的耳朵出了毛病。
    “来，小伙子们，来一把！”邵元杰又重复了一遍。
    不错，是经理要和咱打扑克。平日海上生产忙，经理顾不上，今天——。小伙子们激动了，他们用绳子把身子绑在桌子腿上（桌子是固定的）。
    “老K！”“司令！”好一场扑克大战！忘却了眼前的险境，放松了紧绷的神经。
    “哈……，我们赢了！”邵元杰粗犷的笑声压倒了怒吼的涛声。
    狂风恶浪肆虐了3天3夜，他们在海上紧张搏斗了3天3夜。暴戾的白令海终于服输了，它用细浪轻拍着中国渔轮的船舷，发出赞叹：“好样的，中国船！”
    北太平洋渔场是富饶的、慷慨的，但是对于初来乍到的中国渔船，却显得那样吝啬。
    1987年9月底，烟远一号第4次来到北太平洋渔场。前几次由于海况不熟，收获不大，这一次一连几天收获仍是甚少。
    好几次，电子探鱼仪上明明呈现紫红色，这是密集鱼群的标志，可是网拖上来之后，就是不见鱼，水手们急得拍腿跺脚。原因在哪里呢？
    一向自夸胃口好的邵元杰，像是突然患了厌食症，变得茶饭不思，常常对着海图发怔，有时在驾驶室一蹲就是半天。后来，他的目光停在了显示鱼网在水中深度的网位仪上。鱼群在水中是垂直深度，而网在水中有一定的倾斜度，会不会是网位仪有误差引起的？他把自己的想法说给别人听。
    “这么先进的渔轮，网位仪能有问题？开什么国际玩笑？”不少人根本不相信他的判断。
    “洋设备先进是事实，但我们也不能盲目迷信它。你休息一下，我来带这一网。”邵元杰果断地对值班船长说。邵老板的犟劲众所周知，他认准的事，非干到底不可。
    “甲板注意，网位下压15米，下压……”扩音器里传来邵元杰沙哑宏亮的声音。
    整整一下午，邵元杰在驾驶室里反复探索，终于探明了网位仪的实际误差。下午5点，快到上网的时间，站了一下午的邵元杰累得站不住了，同事们劝他回舱休息去。
    上网了。钢丝绳绷得紧紧的，好兆头！
    囊网出水了，好大的网头！装满了鱼的囊网长龙般地被拖上了后甲板。经测算这一网足有90多吨鱼。
    烟台远洋渔业史上第一个大网头！水手们爬上网包，欢呼、跳跃，互相拥抱，欣喜若狂。许多老船员也是有生以来第一次一网捕这么多鱼，激动得手背直抹眼泪。北太平洋公海渔场上第一次响起了中国船员的欢呼声！此时此刻，过度疲劳的邵元杰累得瘫倒在船舱里，无法和大家共同分享这胜利的喜悦。
    接着第二网120多吨！第三网130多吨！
    烟远一号在北太平海公海渔场作业108天，捕鱼5900多吨，实现产值192万美元。中国水产总公司发来贺电，我国驻美渔业代表处发来贺电，祝贺烟台远洋渔业公司在公海渔场取得的历史性胜利。
    随着胜利喜讯的传播，邵元杰的一个外号也在船员中不胫而走——“渔神”。
    海上“联合国”
    中国人、美国人、德国人、日本人，汉语、英语、德语、日语，烟远一号进入美国经济区作业后，船上有四个国家的人，操着四种不同的语言在工作、生活。不过百米长的渔轮上，俨然是一个海上“联合国”。
    烟远一号上有位美国联营公司的代表，这位先生声称曾在好几个国家的船上工作过，经常出言不逊，态度蛮横。按规定，凡在美国经济区作业的各国渔轮，必须买美国渔船的鱼获，然后由船加工出售。我国烟远一号也须如此。海上买鱼，无法过秤，只能由联营公司代表负责测算。鱼网呈圆柱形，直径粗细不一，网头网尾鱼的密度、比重不同，而这位联营公司代表测算时，直径按最粗的算，密度按最密的算，测算的数量多，而实际数量少，明显地偏向美国渔船。我船员不服，气愤地指出他测量方法不科学，他把头摇得像货郎鼓：“NO！NO！NO！我在许多国家的船上工作过，都是这个量法。”他还经常走进驾驶室，随意摆弄船上设备。我船员提出，损坏设备要他赔偿，他傲慢无礼地说：“我一个月的工资，抵得上你们全船的工资。”言外之意——赔得起。
    难道我们就这样吃这哑巴亏？受窝囊气！
    “不，同志们，同这种人打交道，要有理、有利、有节！”邵元杰耐心地告诫大家。
    一天晚上，邵元杰约请这位代表坐下来谈判。邵元杰从他对囊网的测量方法到他生活上的不检点行为，一一指出，义正词严。有力的发言，像机关枪，字字句句铿锵有力。谈判从晚上七点持续到凌晨一点。最后，邵元杰严正指出：“作为联营公司代表，我不希望你偏向任何一方，只希望你能公正。很遗憾，你没有这样做，你不负责任的工作态度使我们经济上蒙受了损失，你生活上的不检点行为，伤害了中国船员的感情，对此，你是要负责任的。我还要向你们老板反映你在这里的情况。”
    平日傲慢无礼的这位代表似乎此刻才认识到问题的严重性，像一只泄了气的皮球，怔怔地愣在那里无话可说。
    第二天，这位代表改变了过去的测量办法，并提出要和邵老板交朋友，他私下对翻译竖着大拇指说：“你们邵老板，厉害！”
    有矛盾和斗争，也有团结和友谊。绝大多数外国人和中国船员结下了深厚的友谊。
    在烟远一号上工作的联邦德国鱼片加工技师尧根是个长着大胡子的德国人，他对质量要求很严。一次，他发现一个船员对鱼片质量不负责任，抓起一条鱼朝那位船员身上扔去。个别工人想不通，反映到邵元杰那里。邵元杰一面耐心说服大家，把劲用在提高鱼片质量上，一面通过翻译委婉地指出尧根方法上的不当之处。全船上下一齐努力，鱼片质量稳步提高。国内有的渔轮因鱼片质量不过关被迫停止加工鱼片，而烟远一号的鱼片质量深受国际市场欢迎，外国客商发来电传：“烟台的鱼片，有多少我们要多少。”看着电传，尧根和那个挨过鱼打的船员都会心地笑了。在船上，邵元杰还按中国的风俗，为联邦德国巴德尔技师庆贺了他44岁的生日。
    第四个航次结束了，烟远一号要回国了，尧根等人拉住邵元杰的手，恋恋不舍地说：“邵先生，下个航次，我们还要到你的船上工作，还要到你们烟台旅游。”
    邵元杰爽朗地说：“欢迎！欢迎！”
    北太平洋的冬夜，急促地拉下了它黑色的帷幕，茫茫的海与漫漫的夜溶为一体。晚风中飘来菜肴的浓香。哦，今天是1988年元旦。
    在全船最大的房间——船员餐厅里，邵元杰安排了专场晚会——北太平洋之夜音乐会，还邀请许多外国船员参加。
    没有爵士鼓手，没有电声乐队，马达是他们的合弦，涛声为他们伴奏。美国人的渔歌号子，日本人的拉网小调，中国船员的《大海啊，故乡》，还有小伙子们刚健有力的海上迪斯科。唱吧，跳吧，在远离祖国的北太平洋上，欢乐能忘掉乡思，欢乐能战胜寂寞。大海，人类的故乡，只有风口浪尖上闯过来的船员，才有资格在这雄壮的舞台上引吭高歌、尽情跳跃。
    大海是蓝色的，邵元杰的梦也是蓝色的。
    童年那蓝色的梦正在变成现实。烟台远洋渔业公司组建3年来，从小到大，现在已拥有两艘大型拖网加工船和一艘4000吨级冷藏运输船，固定资产5000万元，形成了从捕捞加工到冷藏运输的完整的远洋渔业生产体系，成为国内规模最大、效益最好的远洋渔业公司之一。
    前年9月底到去年6月初，邵元杰率烟远一号、二号第四次远征北太平洋渔场，历时9个月，共捕捞加工鱼获22466吨，完成产值3928万元，为国家创汇651万美元，创造了中国远洋渔业史上航次的最好成绩，两条船9个月人均创产值19万元，创全国远洋渔业最高纪录。
    消息轰动了全国水产界。回国后，来自各方面的参观，使他应接不暇，紧张的海上作业他并没有感到这样疲惫，而今，邵元杰却真的感到累了。一天午后，他伏在办公桌上打了个盹，做了一个梦：
    他梦见千帆竞发，百舸争流，悬挂着五星红旗的强大的渔业船队升火待发，目标：太平洋、大西洋、印度洋……
    梦中，他振臂高喊：“起锚！开航！”
