Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 25th. - Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Xicong, emphasized that the current investigation work must prevent it from becoming a mere formality. It must be clear-cut, resolute, and carried through to the end.

At today's meeting of the leading cadres of Beijing's districts, counties, and bureaus, Li Xicong pointed out that the turmoil and riot posed a severe test for leaders at all levels. The investigation work after the decisive victory in suppressing the riot is also a severe test. The attitudes and understanding of leaders at all levels are key to doing a good job in the investigation work.

Li Xicong said that this turmoil and riot have educated the entire Party and the people of the nation. The danger and threat of "peaceful evolution" still exist. The life-and-death issue of our Party and the Republic has not been fundamentally resolved. The investigation work must be thorough and must not leave any hidden dangers. The biggest danger in the current investigation work is that it becomes a mere formality, that major issues are trivialized, and that it is abandoned halfway. Leaders at all levels of the Party must treat this investigation work as a political and ideological struggle, as a battle for the ideological domain. If socialist ideology and principles do not dominate the ideological domain, problems will inevitably arise.

Li Xicong demanded that all units strengthen their leadership over the investigation work, conduct relevant learning in a targeted manner, and mobilize the masses to thoroughly investigate key events, key units, and key individuals. From the outset, policies must be strictly followed, and the two types of different contradictions must be clearly distinguished. The majority must be united, won over, and educated.

Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Li Qiyang, demanded at today's meeting that all units strengthen their leadership over the investigation work, deepen ideological education, and mobilize the masses to report and expose clues related to counter-revolutionary rioters, carrying the investigation work through to the end.

State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong, presided over today's meeting.

    李锡铭在北京市区县局领导干部大会上强调
    清查工作要防止走过场
    必须旗帜鲜明立场坚定一抓到底
    新华社北京8月25日电　中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭强调，当前的清查工作要防止走过场，必须旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，一抓到底。
    在今天召开的北京市区县局主要领导干部大会上，李锡铭指出，动乱、暴乱对各级领导是一次严峻的考验，取得平暴决定性胜利后的清查工作同样是一次严峻的考验。各级领导的认识和态度是搞好清查工作的关键。
    李锡铭说，这场动乱和暴乱教育了全党和全国人民，“和平演变”的危险和威胁仍然存在，我们党和共和国生死存亡的大问题并没有彻底解决。清查工作必须搞彻底，绝不能留下后患。当前，清查工作最大的危险是走过场，是大事化小，小事化了，半途而废。各级党的领导一定要把这次清查工作当作一场政治斗争、思想斗争，当作意识形态领域中的一场争夺战。意识形态领域社会主义思想和原则不占统治地位，就必然会出问题。
    李锡铭要求各单位对清查工作加强领导，联系实际、有的放矢地进行学习；发动群众搞好对重点事件、重点单位和重点对象的清查工作。要从一开始就认真掌握政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结争取教育大多数。
    市委副书记李其炎在今天的会上要求各单位加强对清查工作的领导，深化思想教育，发动群众检举、揭发反革命暴乱分子线索，把清查工作搞彻底。
    国务委员、北京市市长陈希同主持了今天的会议。
