On July 18, a music hall in London, England, was packed to the brim. On stage, a young blond boy sat confidently at the piano. As his delicate fingers danced across the keys, the hall resonated with melodious piano music. The audience's eyes were filled with tears, and thousands watched the live television broadcast simultaneously.

This was a piano solo concert held to raise funds for the blind. The boy performing on stage was Derek Paravicini. He was born blind.

Derek is ten years old, born on a farm near Windsor Castle in England. He is a descendant of the famous British writer Somerset Maugham. Derek's mother gave birth to him after 25 weeks of pregnancy, and he weighed only 1.5 pounds at birth, with almost no chance of survival. The hospital did everything possible to keep Derek alive, and miraculously, he survived. However, due to the excessive oxygen he received, Derek was left blind.

When Derek was two years old, one day he stumbled upon an old, small piano and played a complete piece of music. His mother was astonished: no one in the family was fond of music, and no one had taught him, yet he could accurately play a complete piece of music, which was as incredible as his survival.

This accidental discovery made Derek's mother realize that her child had extraordinary musical talent. With the support of the local government, Derek entered a school for the disabled in London to study piano.

At school, Derek fully displayed his musical genius, mastering various complex performance techniques in a short time. Teachers were eager to guide him. His classical music teacher, Miss Franklin, asked him the first time she met him, "Can you play a piece by Chopin?" Little Derek replied, "Would you like to hear a piece by Shostakovich?" The school's director, Mr. Adam, said, "I have seen many musically gifted blind children, but Derek is the most outstanding. For any note, if he hears it once, he can play it accurately. He can improvise."

Indeed, Derek has an extraordinary musical talent and a good educational environment. However, more importantly, Derek does not yield to the darkness; he is full of confidence and hope for life. He pours all his heart and emotions into music, expressing his longing for light and his aspirations for the future through music.

Currently, little Derek is still studying in school and is also receiving instruction from the Royal Academy of Music. Experts believe he has the potential to become an outstanding pianist. Derek is gentle in character, never shouts loudly, and never loses his temper. Besides playing the piano, he also enjoys swimming and riding a tricycle. His mother is proud of Derek. She said, "Derek is the happiest child in the world."

    双目失明的小钢琴家
    七月十八日，英国伦敦一家音乐厅内座无虚席。台上，一个金发男童神态自若地坐在钢琴边。随着他那双纤细小手的跳跃，悠扬动听的钢琴曲在大厅回荡……，观众的眼里饱含泪水，成千上万的人同时收看电视转播。
    这是为盲人募捐而举行的钢琴独奏音乐会。正在台上演奏的孩子名叫德里克·帕拉威西尼。他一生下来就双目失明。
    德里克今年十岁，出生在英国温莎堡附近的一座农庄，是英国著名作家毛姆的后代。德里克的母亲怀孕二十五周后早产生下了他，出生时他体重仅一点五磅，几乎没有成活的希望。医院千方百计使德里克奇迹般地活了下来。由于接受过多的氧气，德里克虽能幸免一死，但却看不到他生活的世界了。
    两岁那年，小德里克有一天摸到一架很旧的小型钢琴，弹了一首完整的曲子。他母亲发现后大为吃惊：家里没有人爱好音乐，也从未有人教过他，而他却能准确地弹出完整的曲子，这简直同他能够活下来一样令人不可思议。
    这个偶然的发现，使德里克的母亲意识到，孩子有着极高的音乐天赋。在地方政府的资助下，德里克进入伦敦一所残废人学校学习钢琴。
    在学校，德里克充分发挥了他的音乐天才，很短时间里，就掌握了各种复杂的演奏技巧。老师们都乐于辅导他。古典课老师富兰克林小姐第一次见到德里克时问他：“弹一首肖邦的曲子好吗？”小德里克却回答：“你愿意听肖斯塔科维奇的曲子吗？”该校负责人亚当先生说：“我见过许多有音乐天赋的盲童，德里克是最突出的一个。任何一个音，他只要听一遍，就可以准确地弹出来，他能够即兴演奏。”
    诚然，德里克有着超乎寻常的音乐天赋和良好的教育环境。但是，更重要的是，德里克不向黑暗屈服，对生活充满信心和希望，他把全部的身心和情感都倾注到音乐中去，通过音乐表达他对光明的渴望和对未来的憧憬。
    现在，小德里克仍在学校学习，他还同时受教于皇家音乐学院。专家们认为，他有希望成为出色的钢琴家。小德里克性格温和，从不大声喊叫，也不发脾气。除了弹琴外，他还喜欢游泳和骑三轮车。她的母亲为德里克而感到骄傲。她说：“德里克是世界上最幸福的孩子。”
