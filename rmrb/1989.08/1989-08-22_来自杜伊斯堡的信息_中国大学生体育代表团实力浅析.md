The Chinese university sports delegation, consisting of 70 athletes and a total of 106 people, arrived in West Germany on the 18th and was accommodated in a hotel near the Dusseldorf airport. Although the constant roar of aircraft taking off and landing overhead was disruptive, the team members, being young and vigorous, quickly adapted to the time difference and began intensive training the next day.

The overall strength of the fencing team is not weak.
At 8 a.m. on the 22nd, the women's individual foil fencing competition had already begun.

The women's foil fencing has shown good development since the last Olympics. Although veterans such as Luan Jujie have retired, the team still secured sixth place in the team event at the World Championships in Denver this year, indicating that their strength remains. Our Sun Hongyun was seventh in the Seoul Olympics, Xiao Aihua was third in this year's World Youth Championships, E Jie is this year's national champion, Zhu Yan is the third-place finisher in the last University Games, and Wang Huifen is this year's national runner-up, having reached the top 24 in the World Championships. This lineup is capable of competing.

In the men's events, China is only participating in the epee competition this year. Among these five athletes, only two have participated in an international competition before, while the other three are competing internationally for the first time. There are few standout individuals, making it difficult to compare with other teams and assess their strengths.

The women's rowing team has the best lineup.
The rowing team leader Liu Aijie and the women's lightweight coach Gao Jingping told reporters that this time, the Chinese team is participating in all five events in the women's lightweight and open categories, while the men's team is only participating in two lightweight events. The women's team is the strongest. The participants in the open-level four-person single scull without coxswain, Cao Mianying, Hu Yadong, and Zhou Shouying, are Olympic medalists, with Cao Mianying being the fifth-place finisher, Hu Yadong and Zhou Shouying being silver and bronze medalists, respectively. Only Liu Xirong is competing internationally for the first time. In the open-level four-person double scull event, He Yanhui and Guo Mei have won Olympic bronze medals, while Guo Yanqiu and Yang Haiying are also experienced team members. In the lightweight category, Liang Sanmei and Zeng Meilan are the double scull champions from the last World University Games, and together with Lin Zhiai and Zhang Huajie, they won the four-person single scull without coxswain title at last year's World Championships. The men's team is relatively weak, with all lightweight participants competing internationally for the first time.

The track and field team hopes for the women's team.
In the women's events, we mainly hope for Jin Ling (Asian high jump record holder, 1.97 meters), Huang Zhi Hong (shot put), Hou Xue Mei (discus), and Xiong Qi Ying (Asian long jump record holder, 6.88 meters). If they perform normally, these athletes can compete for the top spots. The men's team is participating in the 110-meter hurdles, long jump, decathlon, pole vault, 400-meter hurdles, and triple jump. Among them, Li Tong is the Asian record holder (13.76 seconds). However, European and American track and field athletes are quite strong, and the results will depend on the participants' performance.

    ——中国大学生体育代表团实力浅析
    包括70个运动员，总计106人的中国大学生体育代表团18日到达西德，被安排在杜塞尔多夫机场附近一家旅馆。虽然有飞机不断在头上起降的轰鸣，队员们到底仗着年轻力壮，很快适应了时差，第二天就投入了紧张的训练。
    击剑整体实力不弱
    22日上午8时，女子花剑个人比赛已经开始。
    女子花剑从去年奥运会后发展趋势很好，虽然栾菊杰等三个老将退了役，但今年在美国丹佛世界锦标赛上仍然取得团体第六名，说明实力犹存，我们的孙洪云是汉城奥运会第七名，肖爱华是今年世界青年锦标赛第三名，鄂杰是今年的全国冠军，朱艳是上届大学生运动会第三名，王会凤是今年的全国亚军，在世界锦标赛上进入前二十四名，这个阵容是可以拚搏一番的。
    男子项目我国今年只参加重剑项目比赛。这五个运动员当中只有两人参加过一次国际大赛，其他三人都是头一次出来比赛，个人突出的非常少，与其他队衡量缺少依据，互不摸底。
    女子赛艇排出最佳阵容
    赛艇领队刘爱杰和女子轻量级教练高敬萍对记者说，这次中国队参加女子轻量级和公开级全部5项比赛，男子只参加轻量级两项。女子队是最强阵容。参加本届公开级四人单桨无舵的曹棉英是奥运会第五名，胡亚东和周守英是奥运会银牌和铜牌获得者，只有刘希蓉是第一次出国比赛。参加公开级四人双桨比赛的何燕雯和郭梅曾获奥运铜牌，郭艳秋和杨海英也都是老队员，有比赛经验。女子轻量级方面，梁三妹和曾美兰是上届世界大学生运动会的双人双桨冠军，在去年的世界锦标赛中与林志爱、张华杰一起取得四人单桨无舵的冠军。男子方面比较弱，轻量级全部是头一次出国比赛。
    田径寄希望于女将
    女子项目方面我们主要寄希望于金铃（亚洲跳高纪录保持者，成绩1.97米）、黄志红（铅球）、侯雪梅（铁饼）和熊其英
  （亚洲跳远纪录保持者，成绩6.88米）。如果发挥正常，这几个人可以一争高低。男队我国参加110米栏，跳远、十项全能、撑竿跳，400米中栏和三级跳。其中李彤是亚洲纪录保持者（13.76秒）。但欧美田径都相当强，成绩取决于参加者的情况。　本报记者　江建国
