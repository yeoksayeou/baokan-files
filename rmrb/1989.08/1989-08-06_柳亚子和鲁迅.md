The leader of the Southern Society of poets, Liu Yazi, has always held Lu Xun in high regard. He once said, "I have always admired Mr. Lu Xun." On October 24, 1950, when Liu Yazi drafted his will, he instructed his daughter, saying, "After my death, I will be cremated and buried naked. All superstitions and wasteful practices are strictly forbidden. Buy a plot in the public cemetery to bury my ashes, and erect a tombstone reading 'The Tomb of Poet Liu Yazi,' that is enough." He also mentioned, "If the location can be near Mr. Lu Xun's tomb, it would be the best." Liu Yazi's wish to have his tomb near Lu Xun's reflects his deep admiration for Lu Xun.

Liu Yazi and Lu Xun, under the white terror of the time, had limited interactions but did have some contact. In May 1932, regarding the arrest of the Cowlan couple by the Third International in Nanjing, Song Qingling issued a declaration demanding their release by the Kuomintang government. Liu Yazi then, along with Lu Xun, sent a joint telegram to rescue them (others who signed included Ding Ling, Mao Dun, Tian Han, and Yu Dafu), echoing Song Qingling's call. Finally, on July 17, the Cowlan couple were released on bail by Song Qingling for medical treatment, and the issue was resolved satisfactorily.

On October 5, 1932, Liu Yazi and Lu Xun met at a banquet. This meeting was arranged by Yu Dafu. On that day, Yu Dafu and his wife Wang Yingxia hosted a dinner at the Shanghai Jufeng Garden, inviting Lu Xun, Liu Yazi, and Zheng Peiyu and their spouses. During the pleasant meeting, Liu Yazi expressed his hope that Lu Xun would write a poem for him, to which Lu Xun agreed. A week later, Lu Xun completed the poem. The October 12 entry in Lu Xun's diary reads:

"In the afternoon, I wrote a scroll for Liu Yazi, which reads: 'When fortune turns, what can one ask for? One dares not turn over but already hits one's head. An old hat covers the face as one passes through the crowded market, a broken boat carries wine as one sails the middle stream. With a stern brow, one coldly faces the pointing of thousands; with a bowed head, one is willing to be an ox for the children. Retreating into a small tower to become one, who cares about winter, summer, spring, and autumn?' Yu Dafu treated me to a meal, a lazy person scribbles, steals half a couplet, and completes a poem to present."

The phrase "to present" means to request Liu and Yu to each write a scroll as a memento. Yu Dafu sent the scroll he wrote to Lu Xun on the 19th. The October 19 entry in Lu Xun's diary reads: "In the afternoon, Yu Dafu came and gave me two poems, one of which was written by Liu Yazi." It is clear that the other poem was written by Yu Dafu himself.

Both Yu and Liu's poems are seven-character quatrains. Yu's poem reads:

"With blurred eyes, I ascend the wine tower, _Wandering_ and _Outcry_ both linger. The mob exhausts its ant-like strength, but cannot stop the river from flowing forever."

Liu's poem reads:

"The pursuit of fame and fortune is endless, but to raise a banner of rebellion is to be remembered for a thousand years. An old man from Jishan is still worth remembering, but who will plan for you, cow and cheese?"

Both Liu and Yu's poems fully affirm Lu Xun's clear stance of love and hate in his fighting spirit. In his 1933 article "My Thoughts on Creating Old and New Poetry," Liu Yazi especially emphasized that Lu Xun's poetry is "a rare treasure on the Chinese poetry stage." He particularly admired the couplet "With a stern brow, one coldly faces the pointing of thousands; with a bowed head, one is willing to be an ox for the children," which shines with brilliant light.

    柳亚子和鲁迅
    刘永平
    南社诗人领袖柳亚子一向对鲁迅备加推崇，他曾经说过：“我生平极服膺鲁迅先生。”1950年10月24日柳亚子预立《遗嘱》时，告其女说：“我死后裸体火葬，一切迷信浪费，绝对禁止，于公墓买一穴地，埋葬骨灰，立碑曰：‘诗人柳亚子之墓’，足矣。”并说：“地点能在鲁迅先生附近，最佳。”柳亚子希望他的墓能靠近鲁迅先生墓，其对鲁迅先生的热爱是十分真挚的。
    柳亚子与鲁迅，在当时的白色恐怖下，交往虽不多，却也有过接触。1932年5月为第三国际牛兰夫妇在南京被捕入狱之事，宋庆龄发表宣言，要求国民党政府释放他们。柳亚子便偕同鲁迅联名发电营救（同时联名的还有丁玲、茅盾、田汉、郁达夫等），与宋庆龄的呼吁为桴鼓之应。终于在7月17日，牛兰夫妇由宋庆龄出面保释就医，得到了妥善解决。
    1932年10月5日，柳亚子和鲁迅在宴会上会面。这次会面，是郁达夫安排的。这一天，郁达夫、王映霞夫妇在上海聚丰园请客，邀请了鲁迅和柳亚子、郑佩宜夫妇。在愉快的会见中，柳亚子提出希望鲁迅为他写一篇自作诗，鲁迅慨然应允。一周之后，鲁迅便写好了。10月12日《鲁迅日记》即有如下记载：
      “午后为柳亚子书一条幅，云：‘运交华盖欲何求，未敢翻身已碰头。旧帽遮颜过闹市，破船载酒泛中流。横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛。躲进小楼成一统，管他冬夏与春秋。’达夫赏饭，闲人打油，偷得半联，凑成一律，以请。”
    所谓“以请”，乃请柳、郁各写一条幅，以作纪念。郁达夫于19日便把所写的条幅给鲁迅送来。《鲁迅日记》10月19日记：“下午达夫来，交诗二笺，其一为柳亚子所写。”不言而喻，另一自为郁达夫所写。
    郁、柳二诗，均为七绝。郁诗云：
    “醉眼朦胧上酒楼，《彷徨》、《呐喊》两悠悠。群氓竭尽蚍蜉力，不废江河万古流。”
    柳诗云：
    “附炎趋势苦未休，能标叛帜即千秋。稽山一老终堪念，牛酪何人为汝谋。”
    柳、郁二诗，均对鲁迅的爱憎分明的战斗精神，给予充分肯定的评价。柳亚子于1933年6月发表《我对于创作旧诗和新诗的感想》一文中，特别强调鲁迅的诗，是中国诗坛上“不可多得的瑰宝。”尤其激赏“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”一联，放射出夺目的光辉。
