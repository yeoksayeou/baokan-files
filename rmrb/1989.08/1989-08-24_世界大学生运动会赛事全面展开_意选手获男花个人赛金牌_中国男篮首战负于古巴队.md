The World University Games are now in full swing. Yesterday afternoon, the men's foil individual competition concluded. The 1985 World Championship winner and 1984 Los Angeles Olympic gold medalist, 27-year-old Italian athlete Mauro Numa, won the gold medal. Hungary's Zoltan Ersek took the silver, and Stefano Cerioni from Italy secured the bronze. Over the past two days, Italian athletes have taken both the men's and women's foil individual gold medals, while Hungarian athletes have won two silver medals.

Four Italians made it into the men's foil top eight, holding an absolute advantage. Hungary, West Germany, Austria, and Japan each had one representative. China did not register for this event.

Last night, the Chinese university men's basketball team lost their first group match 73-90 to Cuba at the Moers Sports Hall.

The Chinese team was reorganized on February 1 of this year. For the first 15 minutes of the match, our team was leading. Cuba quickly switched to a zone defense, which is a weakness for the Chinese team. The Chinese team has practiced this tactic less, resulting in more passing errors. By halftime, the score was 41-52 in favor of Cuba. In the second half, Cuba continued to exploit this tactical advantage, extending their lead from 61-41 to 74-55 and then 82-60. The Chinese team was unable to reverse the situation and lost 73-90.

Cuba's team has good physical conditioning, fast running speed, strong endurance, and quick reactions. They rarely allowed the Chinese team to create scoring opportunities under the basket.

A total of 16 teams are participating in the men's basketball competition, divided into four groups.

    世界大学生运动会赛事全面展开
    意选手获男花个人赛金牌　中国男篮首战负于古巴队
    本报杜伊斯堡8月24日电　记者江建国报道：男子花剑个人赛昨天下午结束。1985年的世界锦标赛冠军和1984年洛杉矶奥运会金牌获得者、27岁的意大利运动员毛罗·努马获得冠军，匈牙利的左尔特·埃尔塞克获亚军，意大利的施台方诺·塞里奥尼获第三名。花剑个人赛两天来，男女两项金牌均被意大利运动员夺走，两枚银牌落入匈牙利运动员之手。
    进入男子花剑前八名的总计有四名意大利人，占绝对优势。匈牙利、联邦德国、奥地利和日本各1人。中国未报名参加这项比赛。
    中国大学生男子篮球队昨晚在莫尔斯体育馆的分组第一场比赛中以73∶90负于古巴队。
    中国队于今年2月1日重新组建。这场比赛的前15分钟，我队处于领先地位。古巴队很快改换成联防战术，而这正是中国队弱点。中国队这种战术练得较少，因而传球失误较多，上半场以41∶52落后。下半场一开始，古巴队仍以这种战术的优势攻我方之短，从61∶41打到74∶55，82∶60，中国队始终没能扭转被动局面，以73∶90失利。
    古巴队素质好，奔跑速度快，耐力强，收得拢，散得快，反应灵活，传球准确。古巴队很少在中国队篮下形成争夺投球机会的局面。
    参加男子篮球比赛共16个队，分为四个组。
