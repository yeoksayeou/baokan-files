The Wanzhou Tax Bureau in Sichuan has combined internal checks with external supervision to establish a comprehensive and integrated supervision system, thereby promoting integrity building.

Each county and city tax bureau under the jurisdiction of this bureau has established a supervision office (section). In addition to full-time personnel, 125 part-time supervisors have been appointed in the grassroots tax offices. Over the years, various levels of supervision agencies have investigated and dealt with 107 cases of law and discipline violations, involving an amount of over 1 million yuan.

They have also established a reporting system. Each county and city tax bureau reports the disciplinary inspection situation of its subordinate units to the regional bureau in writing by June and mid-December each year. The inspections are divided into self-inspections by departments, sections, and offices, spot checks by county and city bureaus, and cross-checks by the regional bureau, basically forming a systematic tax personnel management system.

While emphasizing internal checks, they have strengthened external supervision. They cooperate with the "Wanzhou Daily" to open a regular column, publishing "Open Letters to Taxpayers" and "Regulations on the Punishment of Tax Personnel Violating Professional Ethics," making tax laws, administration, penalties, exemptions, and disciplines public to society. The entire system has also set up 12 hotlines and 179 suggestion boxes for reporting and supervising tax personnel. Some counties and cities regularly invite local party and government leaders, taxpaying units, and individuals to evaluate tax personnel.

Due to effective measures, the integrity awareness of tax personnel has been significantly strengthened. In recent years, the entire system has rejected 2,500 invitations to meals, 1,200 gifts, and nearly 300 bribes. The system's tax revenue has increased year by year, and the tasks have been overfulfilled consecutively. In the first half of this year, the bureau, as a special invited representative, shared its experience at the National Tax Political Work Conference.

    建立综合配套的监督机制
    万县地区税务局抓廉政效果好
    本报讯　四川万县地区税务局将内部制约与外部监督相结合，建立起综合配套的监督体系，促进了廉政建设。
    这个局所属各县、市局都建立了监察科（股），除了专职干部外，在基层税务所聘请了兼职监察员125人。各级监察机构近年来已查处违法违纪案件107起，涉及金额100万余元。
    他们还建立起检查报告制度。各县市局每年6月和12月中旬以前，分别将所属单位的纪律检查情况书面报告地区局。检查分为科、股、所自查，县市局抽查，地区局分片交叉检查，基本上形成了一套系统的税务人员管理制度。
    在重视内部制约的同时，加强外部监督。他们与《万县日报》合作，开辟定期专栏，刊发给纳税户的《公开信》和《税务人员违反职业纪律的处罚规定》，做到税法、征管、处罚、减免、纪律等向社会公开。全系统还设立起针对税务人员的举报、监督电话12部，举报箱179个。一些县市还定期请当地党政领导、纳税单位和个人，对税务人员进行评议。
    由于措施得力，有效地加强了税务人员的廉政意识。近年来全系统拒吃请2500多人次，拒礼1200人次，拒贿近300人次。全系统税收逐年增加，连年超额完成任务。今年上半年该局作为特邀代表，在全国税务政工会议上介绍了经验。
