On July 22, 1989, in Longchang. The Standing Committee of the Longchang Municipal Party Committee specially visited the small Wooden Spring Factory in Jutai City to learn from the factory director, Yu Chenghua. This compatriot of the Republic, earnestly reported on her work. The municipal party leaders listened intently, taking notes like students in class.

Yu Chenghua's touching deeds deeply moved the leaders. The next day, despite it being a Sunday, the municipal party committee members returned to the standing committee meeting room and seriously held a life meeting, comparing themselves to Yu Chenghua to find their shortcomings. Compared to her, they felt guilty and deeply respectful: in terms of age, they were much older; in terms of position, they were much higher; but in terms of spirit, they were far behind.

The life meeting lasted from morning to evening. Yu Chenghua's moving deeds of wholeheartedly serving the people and selfless dedication were replayed in everyone's mind.

Struggling for the People

In 1982, the Youth Factory, an affiliate of the Jutai Wooden Factory with 77 people, was groaning in the autumn wind: two rows of low houses with skylights on the roof; broken doors and windows, letting in light from all sides; puddles in the courtyard, emitting a foul smell; garbage everywhere, with no place to step. There was no capital, no equipment, no technology, and no fixed products. They owed external debts of more than 100,000 yuan and a year's wages to the workers. The factory was on the brink of collapse.

It was at this critical moment that Yu Chenghua was sent to the factory by the party.

"To save this factory, we must first have a fixed product." So, she thought of her own spring production technology and went to Longchang six times to find users who needed springs.

The first time she visited the Longchang Bicycle Factory. Upon hearing that they were from a small youth factory, they quickly showed her out. But Yu Chenghua did not give up. If once didn't work, she tried twice; if twice didn't work, she tried three times. By the fourth time, Yu Chenghua couldn't hold back any longer. She pleaded patiently and firmly, "Although our factory is small, we can guarantee the quality of the springs and the delivery time. Please let us make some samples first. If you think they are good, we can place an order; if not, I won't come again!"

Sincerity moves even stones. They gave her a blueprint: "Bring the samples tomorrow." Yu Chenghua treasured the blueprint as if it were a gem and left the factory. But she was worried again: at home, except for a borrowed old lathe, there was nothing else. How could she make the samples? She hurried to the First Automobile Factory in Longchang, where she had once studied, and borrowed some angle iron and wire. She carried these materials back to Jutai without stopping.

It was already past 8 p.m. She didn't go home but rushed straight to the factory to start making springs. This was a sample related to the fate of the factory! Other workers were not skilled, fearing that they might mess up. The process of rolling, breaking, and about ten other steps, she did them all by herself, working through the night until dawn, when several dozen samples were finally made. She carried these samples to the Longchang Bicycle Factory. A comrade took the samples and said, "The quality is not bad!" Yu Chenghua breathed a sigh of relief: "Then can you place an order?" A comrade in charge of production said, "It just so happens that we need 5,000 brake springs tomorrow. Can you deliver them by tomorrow?" "Sure!" She turned around and rushed back to Jutai.

She led more than 20 workers to join this special battle that night.

The winter night was bitterly cold. Despite the stove in the drafty workshop, everyone was still shivering. They wrapped themselves in quilts and cotton, but their hands were still frozen and numb. No one complained about the cold. Yu Chenghua and the others had their hands blistered and bleeding, but no one complained about the pain. They continued to fight. They welcomed the dawn again, and 5,000 completely qualified springs were finally made! At this time, Yu Chenghua had been awake for more than 50 hours.

These more than 50 hours were not ordinary time shown on a clock, and these 5,000 springs were not ordinary products. They all shone with the brilliant light of Yu Chenghua and her comrades' hard work! It was the first shift again. Yu Chenghua, with two workers, carried the springs and went to the Longchang Bicycle Factory for the sixth time. A long-term supply contract was signed.

From then on, the factory had a fixed spring product and was renamed the Wooden Spring Factory. The number of employees increased to more than 140, and the business expanded. Under Yu Chenghua's leadership, the atmosphere of thrift in running the enterprise became even stronger.

There were not enough machine tools, so she led everyone to take discarded ones, repair them, and use them; there was no heat treatment pot, so they welded one themselves; there were not enough spring molds, so they made them themselves; the required raw materials were picked from the scrap pile, bought cheaply from the scrap station or other factories. Just these few items saved seven or eight hundred thousand yuan each year. Under Yu Chenghua's influence, the workers were always thrifty, always paying attention to whether there were things the factory could use, no matter where they went. Anything useful, even a screw, was brought back to the factory.

Everyone also gave Yu Chenghua a nickname: "stingy." Indeed, no one was more "stingy" than her. Because she believed that hard work was the party's legacy, and even if life was good, it should not be abandoned. So, she tried to spend one yuan as if it were ten; no matter how far she went, she did not sit in a sleeper car or stay in a hotel costing more than five yuan per night; she did not eat in restaurants, only ate bread and instant noodles. In short: how to save money, how to do it. Last spring, Yu Chenghua led three people to Shenyang on business. They arrived at the station at 11 p.m. She thought all the hotels were too expensive. She walked until 2 a.m. before finding a hotel that cost more than three yuan per night. In Shenyang for two and a half days, she ate seven meals of bread. A colleague, Xiao Wei, said, "After that, I got nauseous just smelling bread. I won't go on a business trip with Aunt Yu again. That was torture!"

"She has a heart that beats with the people"

Yu Chenghua had a sensitive thermometer in her heart, caring for the warmth of every worker. Whoever was sick, or whoever had difficulties, she knew quickly and cared for them wholeheartedly to solve their problems.

Li Min was a disabled person who had left the factory to work on his own. Now that the factory was doing better, how could he not be happy? But before he could open his mouth, Yu Chenghua came to pick him up and arranged for him to design the beautification of the factory area. Li Jun, a veteran who had been widowed for many years, struggled to raise two children, especially during the New Year, which was even harder. Yu Chenghua sent 200 yuan, and the children happily wore new clothes. Wang Yanhua was an orphan who had grown up with her grandmother. After graduating from middle school, she was worried about having no job, but Yu Chenghua had already found her and brought her into the factory. The people said, "Yu Chenghua has a heart that beats with ours!"

There were countless such incidents.

Wang Fei, who had lost his mother at a young age, often skipped school and fought. His father heard that Yu Chenghua had the "power to turn back the heavens" in educating youth, so as soon as Wang Fei graduated from junior high school, he sent him to Yu Chenghua's factory. Wang Fei was still uncontrollable when he first entered the factory, but Yu Chenghua kept a close eye on him. Seeing that he sometimes went hungry, Yu Chenghua brought him extra food every day. In winter, he had no winter coat, so Yu Chenghua gave him her son's new coat. Wang Fei's heart was filled with warmth: "If I don't work hard, I will really let Aunt Yu down!" He had already regarded Yu Chenghua as his mother.

Last year, Wang Fei had a girlfriend. The girl's mother came to see her future son-in-law. It happened that his father was not at home. Wang Fei, who was just 20 years old, was anxious and restless. Yu Chenghua heard about it and immediately came over, tidying up Wang Fei and the house. The girl's mother came for the meeting. Yu Chenghua joyfully told the future mother-in-law, "Although I am not Wang's mother, I can be his godmother and act on his behalf. Because I know him. I can be the matchmaker for the two of them. Today, let's settle this matter. Tomorrow, I will help them with the wedding, ensuring it is both thrifty and lively." The future mother-in-law was delighted. In the meantime, Yu Chenghua took out a fashionable shirt from her bag: "Girl, this is a little token, as an engagement gift!" The girlfriend and her mother happily went back, but Wang's heart was filled with waves of warmth that did not subside for a long time.

Gao Yan, who was 28 years old, had been in and out of the factory four times and was famous in Jutai as "Gao Laoda." Due to various misdeeds, the factory was preparing to fire him. His father's belt had been broken three times, and his mother's tears had dried up, but they had not been able to educate him.

Yu Chenghua, who had devoted all her heart to the people, was determined to save him. She racked her brains and worried for him. Whenever she had time, she would talk to him heart to heart, patiently guiding him. "Yan, wandering outside is not the way. The factory does not plan to fire you anymore. You should go to work. If you have any difficulties, everyone will help you."

But Gao Yan worked for a few days and then disappeared again. Yu Chenghua searched for him all over the streets and found him preparing to cause trouble with a group of people. She pulled him out of the crowd and talked to him until 3 a.m. It was also on this night that his group of friends was arrested for a joint crime. Gao Yan's heart was deeply shaken.

From the next day on, Gao Yan really went to work. Yu Chenghua took even more care of him. When Yan was getting married, he couldn't afford new bedding, so Yu Chenghua made it for him; if he lacked anything else, Yu Chenghua would help him buy it, treating him better than her own family. Gao Yan's cold heart gradually melted.

But one day, a few hooligans came to the factory to cause trouble. Gao Yan rushed up to stop them. But one of them said, "Gao Yan, haven't you had enough of the steamed buns?" These words were like a bucket of cold water, extinguishing the hot enthusiasm for repentance and reform that had just emerged in him. He gave up again. That night, he fought with his friends and was sent to the detention center again.

Yu Chenghua heard about it and immediately went to see him, putting a bag of fruit on the table and saying, "Yan, tell me what happened?" The usually unyielding "Gao Laoda" actually shed tears at this moment: "Aunt Yu, I let you down!" Yu Chenghua said with concern, "You should first explain the matter to the police. Even if you are sentenced, the factory will not fire you. I will take care of your wife and children's living expenses. As long as you reform well." Gao Yan cried loudly, "Aunt Yu, you can rest assured. I will definitely reform and work hard!" Yu Chenghua's eyes also reddened.

When Gao Yan was released from the detention center this time, he had completely become a new person. He told everyone with tears in his eyes, "My father's belt didn't beat me over, and my mother's tears didn't cry me over. It was Aunt Yu's warm heart that changed me! If every party member helped people like me, this society would be so good!" Now, Gao Yan has become the head of the security department of the factory. Under Yu Chenghua's care and education, nine young people like Gao Yan have now become the backbone of the factory.

Just like this, Yu Chenghua's heart was in tune with the people, and they were inseparable. In the factory, no one called her director. The elders called her Chenghua, the peers called her Yu Jie, and the younger ones affectionately called her Aunt Yu. She loved the people infinitely, and the people loved her even more. When the social order was bad, people secretly protected her; when she was sick, the people were especially concerned and cared for her. Just as everyone saw that she was busy with work and had lumbar muscle strain, they pooled money to buy her a washing machine. Her family won a lottery and got a washing machine and four other big items. Everyone was happy for her.

"The essence of a Communist Party member is a 'public' character"

Yu Chenghua was so devoted to the people, but she never put herself first, sometimes even being very strict with herself. People praised her, "Her heart is only for the people, and there is no place for herself."

Last year, according to the contract, Yu Chenghua should have received a bonus of 210,000 yuan. But she announced that she would not take a single cent. Some well-meaning people advised her, "Why are you so stupid? Our factory's output value last year reached 600,000 yuan, and the profits and taxes were 180,000 yuan. You have made great contributions. You should take the bonus. Besides, you and your family of five have been living in your mother's old house for decades. You should buy a commercial apartment and relax."

But Yu Chenghua said, the essence of a Communist Party member is a "public" character. When I signed the contract, I never thought about the bonus, I just wanted to run the factory well and contribute more to the people. So, I have no bonus figures in my mind, only a party membership number: May 12, 1986. From that day on, I have given everything to the party and decided to struggle for communism all my life. Now, the trend of "everything for money" is very serious. I think money is useful, but it cannot be a slave to money. Besides, the bonus will eventually be spent. Leaving it for the factory to develop production can create more wealth. As a Communist Party member, I should take the lead in breaking the shackles of the "money is everything" mentality and bravely challenge "money worship."

Yu Chenghua's management skills attracted many people. Someone offered her a high salary, but she declined. Some individual businessmen advised her to go out and make big money, but she just smiled and shook her head. Yu Chenghua did not go out with the individual businessmen, but instead, the individual businessmen became Yu Chenghua's "captives," giving up making big money and becoming workers in Yu Chenghua's factory. They said, "Yu Chenghua has something that others don't have, attracting us." That is the noble quality of a Communist Party member who is selfless and public-spirited.

In the spring of 1987, her old mother was critically ill. Yu Chenghua's brother and sister rushed from outside the province to be by their mother's side. At this time, there was a spring order fair in another province. She thought, the livelihood of more than 100 workers and the future of the factory were all in her hands. Such an opportunity could not be missed. So, she gritted her teeth and stood up to leave. Her brother and sister, who were crying by the side, were furious: "You are really heartless! Don't you know that mother has already put on her funeral clothes?" Yu Chenghua's heart was torn apart, and tears immediately welled up. How could she not know that her mother had worked the hardest for her, and she was her mother's most beloved daughter, and at this moment, her mother was most concerned about her! But who made her the director! She knelt by her mother's bed, tidying her mother's white hair at her temples, and sadly stood up, walking towards the door, and boarded the southbound train. Fortunately, the old lady pulled through again.

Yu Chenghua has two sons. Because she devoted herself to her career, her husband was also busy at work, and she could not take care of the children's lives and studies at all. The children often had no food to eat, no clothes to change, and slept on cold kangs in winter. One day, her younger son, Xiaoyu, had a fever and cried for his mother. But Yu Chenghua had something to do at the factory, so she coaxed the son to go to his father. A phone call summoned the father away. Neighbor Old Wei couldn't bear it and took Xiaoyu to the hospital. Old Wei was mistaken by the doctor for an irresponsible father and was scolded.

Similarly, the factory's driver, Teacher Huang, also had the fortune to be a "proxy parent." It was the day before Xiaoyu graduated from elementary school. The school was holding a parent-teacher meeting, and Xiaoyu begged his mother to come this time, because it was the last parent-teacher meeting of elementary school. The mother, who had attended only one of the ten parent-teacher meetings in five years of her son's schooling, agreed this time without hesitation. Before the meeting, Xiaoyu happily stood at the school gate waiting for his mother. But other people's mothers had come, and his mother was still not there, making him anxious and almost crying. At this time, the factory's driver, Uncle Huang, came face to face, and Xiaoyu thought it was his mother who had sent another "proxy parent," so he pulled Uncle Huang in without saying a word. In fact, Xiaoyu did not know that his mother had forgotten the promise she made in the morning as soon as she went to work. Uncle Huang, this unexpected "guest," although he saved Xiaoyu, was scolded himself. Because Xiaoyu was too messy: his pants were torn and had not been mended for days; his socks were one black and one white; his hair was long enough to make a bird's nest, and no one had cut it.

The teacher, facing these situations, was very puzzled and quietly asked Xiaoyu, "Is your mother a stepmother?" The child, who did not yet understand, told his mother at home about the teacher's words. These words were like a sharp knife stabbing Yu Chenghua's heart! How could there be a mother in the world who does not love her own flesh and blood? She wanted to give her children more love so much, but the children did not understand that the factory had more children who needed her! One day, the child asked his mother, "When will you stop being the director? If you are still so busy and ignore us, when you get old, we will also ignore you!" Yu Chenghua's eyes filled with tears. The child wailed and threw himself into his mother's arms, and the mother tightly hugged her son.

    乐于奉献的共产党员
    ——记长春市九台木器弹簧厂厂长于嫦华
    陈明星　郭力群　杨红雨
    1989年7月22日。长春。长春市委常委们专程来到九台市小小的木器弹簧厂，向厂长于嫦华学习。这位共和国的同龄人，认真汇报着自己的工作。市委领导们都像小学生上课似的，聚精会神地边听边记笔记。
    于嫦华感人肺腑的事迹，深深打动着领导的心。翌日，尽管是星期天，市委一班人仍回到常委会议室，认真召开生活会，对照于嫦华找差距。与她比，大家深感愧疚，无比敬佩：论年龄，比她大得多；说职务，比她高得多；然而看精神，比她差得多。
    生活会，从早晨一直开到晚上。于嫦华全心全意为人民服务、无私奉献的动人业绩，一幕幕地在大家脑海中再现出来。
    为人民艰苦创业
    那是1982年，拥有77人的九台木器厂附属青年厂，在秋风中凄苦地呻吟着：两排低矮的小房，屋顶开着天窗；门窗破损，四处透亮；院内水坑，散发着臭味；垃圾遍地，无处下脚。无资金，无设备，无技术，无定型产品。欠外债10多万元，欠工人一年工资。风雨飘摇，濒临倒闭。
    就在这个关键时刻，党派于嫦华来到这个厂。
    “要救活这个厂，首先得有固定的产品。”于是，她想到自己有生产弹簧的技术，“六顾茅庐”去长春，寻找需要弹簧的用户。
    第一次来到长春自行车厂。人家一听他们是小小的青年厂，就赶紧送客。但嫦华没灰心，一次不行两次，两次不行三次。到第四次，嫦华憋不住了，耐心而坚定地央求道：“别看我们厂子小，一定能保证弹簧质量，保证交货时间。您就先让我们作些样品，您看行，就订点货；不行，我也就不再来了！”
    精诚所至，金石为开。人家交给她一张图纸：“明天送样品来吧。”嫦华如获至宝，怀揣图纸出了厂门。可她又犯愁了：家里除了一台借来的破车床外一无所有，这样品怎么做？她心急如火地来到曾进修过的长春第一汽车厂，借了一些角钢和钢丝。她背着这些原料，马不停蹄，回到九台。
    这时已是晚上8点多了。她没顾上回家，直奔工厂，立刻动手做弹簧。这是关系到厂子命运的样品啊！别的工人技术不熟练，怕弄不好砸锅。卷簧、断簧等十来道工序，她一人干下来，整整一夜，到东方发白时，几十件样品做出来了。她背起这些样品来到长春自行车厂。一位同志接过样品一看：“质量不错嘛！”嫦华松了一口气：“那你们就订些货吧？”一位负责生产的同志说：“正好明天缺5000个闸簧，你们明天赶出来吧。”“行！”她转身赶回九台。
    她连夜领着20多个工人投入了这场特殊的战斗。
    冬夜，寒彻入骨。四面透风的车间里，尽管生着炉子，还是冻得大伙打哆嗦。把被子、棉絮披在身上，依然冻得手不好使，可是没一人叫冷。嫦华和大伙，手都磨破流血，但没一人喊疼，仍然坚持战斗。他们又一次迎来了东方发白，5000个完全合格的弹簧终于做出来了！这时，嫦华已有50多个小时没合眼了。
    这50多个小时啊，不是一般钟表显示的时间，这5000个弹簧也不是普通的产品，都闪烁着嫦华和她的伙伴们艰苦奋斗的灿烂光辉！又是头班车，嫦华带着两名工人，背着弹簧，第六次来到长春自行车厂。一个长期供货合同签订了。
    从此，厂里有了固定的弹簧产品，改名为木器弹簧厂。职工增加到140多人，家业扩大了，在嫦华的带动下，勤俭办企业的风气更浓了。
    机床不够，她就领着大伙，把人家淘汰的拿来修一修再用；没有热处理锅，他们自己焊制；弹簧模具不足，他们自己动手做；所需原材料，有的从废料堆捡来，有的从废品站或别的厂家廉价买来。仅这几项，每年节约七八万元。在嫦华的影响下，职工们时时做节约的“有心人”，不管走到哪里，都留意观察有没有厂里可用的东西，凡是有用的，哪怕是一颗螺丝钉，都弄到厂里。
    大家还给嫦华一个美名：“抠门”。确实再没有谁比她更“抠”了。因为她认为艰苦奋斗是我们党的传家宝，日子好了，也不能丢掉。所以，她恨不得把1元当10元花；不论出门多远，不坐卧铺，不住5元以上一宿的旅店；不下饭馆，只吃面包、方便面。一句话：怎么省钱怎么办。去年春天，嫦华领着3人去沈阳办事。下火车已经深夜11点了。站前的旅店，她都嫌贵。她一直走到凌晨两点多，才找到3元多一宿的旅店。在沈阳两天半，吃了七顿面包。同去的小魏说：“打那以后，我一闻面包就反胃。以后再不跟于姨出差了，那是遭罪！”
    “她与群众心连心”
    于嫦华心里有一只灵敏的温度表，牵挂着每个职工的冷暖。谁生病了，哪位职工有为难之处，她很快知道，并关怀备至地去排忧解难。
    李民是离厂单干的残疾人。如今厂子有了起色，他能不活心吗？可没等他开口，嫦华就来接他回厂，安排他做厂区美化设计。守寡多年的老师傅李君，拉扯两个小孩不容易，每逢年关更是难过，嫦华送去200元，孩子们高高兴兴穿上了新衣服。王艳华是从小没爹娘、跟着奶奶过的苦孩子，中学毕业正愁没活干，嫦华已经找上门来，收她进了厂。群众说：“嫦华与咱们心连心啊！”
    这样的事，不计其数。
    从小失去母爱的王飞，常常逃学、打架。他爸爸听说嫦华有教育青年的“回天之力”，待王飞初中一毕业，就把他送到嫦华厂里。王飞刚进厂，仍收不住心，嫦华用心盯着他。看他饥一餐饱一顿，嫦华就每天多带点饭给他吃。入冬，他没棉袄穿，嫦华就把儿子的新棉袄给他穿上。王飞的心头涌上一股暖流：“再不好好干，真对不起于姨！”他已经把嫦华当作亲妈看了。
    去年，王飞处了个对象。女方的妈妈要来相女婿。偏赶上爸爸不在家。刚刚20岁的王飞急得团团转。嫦华得知后，立即赶来了，把王飞和屋里收拾得没挑。相亲的来了。嫦华兴高采烈地对未来的亲家母说：“虽然我不是小王的妈，但我可以做他的干妈，替他作主。因为我了解他。我可以做他俩的介绍人，今天就把这事定下来。赶明儿我就替他俩操办，保证既俭朴，又热闹。”未来的亲家母乐得满脸开花。说话间，嫦华又从提包里拿出一件时髦的衬衫：“姑娘，这就算一点心意，做了订婚礼物吧！”女朋友和她妈高高兴兴地回去了，可小王心中的万倾热浪久久没有平静。
    28岁的高艳生，已经“四进宫”，是九台赫赫有名的“高老大”。由于种种劣迹，工厂准备开除他。他爸爸的皮带已打折三根，他妈妈的眼泪也已哭干，没把他教育过来。
    把全部心血倾注在群众身上的于嫦华，决心把他挽救过来。她为他绞尽了脑汁，操碎了心。她一有空就找他促膝谈心，耐心开导。“艳生啊，总在外面闲逛，不是办法。厂里不打算开除你了。你还是上班吧，有什么困难，大伙会帮助你的。”
    可高艳生上班没几天，又不见人影了。嫦华满街找他，发现他正在街上和一伙人准备闹事，就把他从哥们儿堆里拉回家，和他一直谈到凌晨三点。也就在这天晚上，他那帮哥们合伙作案被捕了。高艳生的心深受震动。
    从第二天开始，高艳生真正上班了。嫦华对他更是关怀入微。艳生要结婚了。做不起新铺盖，嫦华就给他做；缺什么其它东西，嫦华就帮他买，比对亲人还亲。高艳生那颗冰冷的心逐渐融化了。
    可是，一天，几个流氓来厂胡闹。高艳生冲上去准备制止。但有一人说：“高艳生，你窝窝头还没吃够哇？”这句话仿佛一桶冷水，把他刚刚焕发出来的悔改自新的热情泼灭了。他又破罐破摔。当晚，他就和哥们狠狠打了一架，再次进了拘留所。
    嫦华获悉后，立刻去看他，把一兜水果放在桌上，恨铁不成钢地说：“艳生，你说说到底怎么回事？”从来不示弱的“高老大”，此时此刻居然流出了泪水：“于姨，我对不起你！”嫦华关切地说：“你先把事情跟公安局说清楚。即使判了刑，厂子也不开除你。你妻子、孩子的生活费我负责，只要你好好改造。”高艳生感动地嚎啕大哭：“于姨，你放心吧，以后我一定重新做人，好好干！”嫦华的眼圈也红了。
    等到高艳生这次从拘留所出来，完全换了一个新人。他眼含热泪向人们倾诉心里话：“爸爸的皮带没把我打过来，妈妈的眼泪没把我哭过来，是于姨那颗温暖的诚心把我感化过来了！要是每个党员都像于姨那样帮助我这样的人，那这个社会该多好啊！”如今，高艳生已成了厂里的保卫科长。在嫦华的关心、教育下，9名高艳生似的后进青年，现在都成了厂里的骨干力量。
    就是这样，嫦华与群众心心相印，亲密无间。在厂里没人叫她厂长。年长的喊她嫦华，平辈的称她于姐，年小的亲昵地叫她于姨。她无限热爱人民，人民更加爱戴她。当社会治安不好时，人们暗中保护她；当她生病时，群众格外心疼她、体贴她。正当大伙看她工作忙，又腰肌劳损，凑钱给她买洗衣机时，他们家喜得彩奖，添了洗衣机等四大件。大伙都为她庆幸。
    “共产党员的本质是一个‘公’字”
    于嫦华对群众是那样呕心沥血，可从来没把自己放在心上，有时对自己似乎很苛刻。人们赞扬她“心中只有人民，唯独没有她自己。”
    去年，按承包合同嫦华应得奖金2.1万元。可她宣布，分文不收。有些好心人劝她，你为啥这样犯傻，咱们厂去年产值已达60万，利税18万，你立了汗马功劳。这奖金你应该要。再说，你一家五口挤在妈妈旧房里已经几十年了，也该买套商品房松快松快。
    可是，嫦华说，共产党员的本质就是一个“公”字。承包时，我压根儿就没想得奖金，只是想把厂子办好，为人民多做贡献。所以，我头脑里没有奖金数字，只有一个入党的数字：1986年5月12日。从这天起，我已把我的一切交给了党，决心为共产主义奋斗终生。眼下，“一切向钱看”的倾向十分严重。我认为，金钱是有用的，但不能做金钱的奴隶。再说，奖金总会花完的，留给厂子发展生产，可以创造更多财富。我作为共产党员，应该带头冲破“金钱万能”的思想牢笼，勇敢地向“拜金主义”挑战。
    嫦华经营有道，吸引着许多人。有人高薪聘请她，她谢绝了。有些个体户劝她出去挣大钱，她笑着摇摇头。嫦华没有被个体户拉出去，相反，个体户成了嫦华的“俘虏”，放弃了赚大钱，到嫦华厂里当了工人。他们说：“嫦华身上有一种别人没有的东西吸引着我们。”那就是一个共产党员忘我、为公的高尚品质。
    1987年春天，老母亲病危。嫦华的哥哥、姐姐都从外地赶到母亲身边。这时，正值外地有一个弹簧订货会。她想，100多职工的生计、厂子今后的命运，都掌握在自己手里。这样的机会不能错过。于是，她一咬牙，起身要走。在一旁饮泣的哥哥、姐姐火了：“你实在没心没肺，妈妈寿衣都穿了，你不知道吗？！”嫦华心如刀绞，眼泪顿时涌了出来。她怎么不知道，母亲为自己操劳最多，她是母亲最疼爱的小女儿，此刻母亲最放心不下的就是她！可是谁让她是厂长呢！她跪在母亲床边，为母亲理理两鬓的白发，悲然起身，向门外走去，登上了南行的列车。欣慰的是老人又一次挺了过来。
    嫦华有两个儿子。由于她一心扑在事业上，爱人也工作忙，对孩子的生活、学习全然顾不上。孩子们常常没饭吃，没衣换，冬天睡冷炕。一天，小儿子小宇发烧了，哭着要妈妈。可嫦华因厂里有事，就连说带哄把儿子推给爸爸。一个电话又将爸爸唤去了。邻居老魏看不下去，主动带小宇去医院。老魏被医生误认为是一个不负责任的爸爸，遭到一顿训斥。
    无独有偶。厂里的司机黄师傅也有幸做了一次“代理家长”。那是小宇小学毕业前夕，学校要开家长会，小宇恳求妈妈这一次一定要去，因为这是小学的最后一次家长会了。儿子上学五年开了10次家长会只参加过一次的妈妈，这一次不忍心再让儿子失望，痛快地答应了。开会前，小宇高兴地站在校门口迎候妈妈。可是，别人的妈妈都来了，自己的妈妈还没影，急得快哭了。这时，厂里的司机黄叔叔迎面走来了，小宇认定又是妈妈派来的“代理家长”，便不由分说把黄叔叔拉了进去。其实，小宇哪里知道，妈妈一上班，就把早上的承诺忘了。黄叔叔这个巧遇的“不速之客”，虽然救了小宇，自己却挨了一顿训。因小宇太邋遢：露了肉的裤子，穿了几天，没人给补；脚上的袜子，一只黑的、一只白的；头发长得可作鸟窝了，也没人给剪剪。
    老师面对这些情形，非常纳闷，悄悄问小宇：“你妈妈是不是后妈？”还不太懂事的孩子，回家便把老师的这句话告诉了妈妈。这句话宛如一把尖刀刺在嫦华心上！天下哪有一个母亲不爱自己的亲骨肉，她是多么想多给孩子一些母爱啊，可孩子哪里懂得，厂里还有更多的孩子需要她呀！一天，孩子问妈妈：“你那厂长要当到啥时候呀？你要是再这么忙，不管我们，等你老了，我们也不管你了！”嫦华眼里溢出热泪。孩子哇地一声哭了，扑进妈妈怀里，妈妈也紧紧搂住儿子。
