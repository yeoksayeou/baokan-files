Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 20th.

Poland's Solidarity Union spokesman, Ennyshkevich, said today in an interview with the American Broadcasting Company in Warsaw that the new Polish government led by Solidarity Union hopes to obtain $10 billion in economic aid over the next three years.

Ennyshkevich said, although U.S. President Bush promised $119 million in loans during his visit to Poland in July this year, Poland needs more loans. He said, "$10 billion would be a very good investment" and could ensure a "democratic Poland."

Ennyshkevich said that Solidarity Union leaders have preliminarily drafted the amount of loans they hope to obtain from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, but the spokesman did not disclose the specific figures and did not want to discuss the amount of loans that might be obtained from some countries.

Ennyshkevich made these remarks after Polish President Jaruzelski nominated the editor of Solidarity Union's newspaper, Mazowiecki, to be the prime minister.

    波团结工会向美国求援
    希望3年获得100亿美元
    新华社华盛顿8月20日电  波兰团结工会发言人恩尼什凯维奇今天在华沙接受美国广播公司采访时表示，由团结工会领导的波兰新政府希望在今后3年中能够获得100亿美元的经济援助。
    恩尼什凯维奇说，尽管美国总统布什今年7月访问波兰时曾答应提供1.19亿美元的贷款，但是，波兰需要更多的贷款。他说，“100亿美元将是非常好的投资”，并能够确保一个“民主的波兰”。
    恩尼什凯维奇说，团结工会领导人已初步拟出了希望从世界银行和国际货币基金组织获得的贷款数额，但这位发言人不愿透露具体数字，也不愿谈论从一些国家可能得到的贷款数额。
    恩尼什凯维奇是在波兰总统雅鲁泽尔斯基提名团结工会报纸主编马佐维耶茨基担任总理后发表这番谈话的。
