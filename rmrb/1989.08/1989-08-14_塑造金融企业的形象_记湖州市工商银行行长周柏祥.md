“Hey, Zhang, the manager, are you going to the financial press conference held by the Industrial and Commercial Bank tomorrow?” “Yes, you should go too.” “Sure, I’ll definitely go.” In March this year, before the financial press conference in Lake Town, two business leaders had this conversation.

So far, three financial press conferences have been held, with Zhou Boshuang, the president of Lake Town Industrial and Commercial Bank and senior economist, as the main speaker. The audience consists of hundreds of factory managers, directors, and financial staff from various enterprises in the city.

The first financial press conference was held in July last year. At that time, the country was facing a severe situation with excessive currency issuance, rapid loan disbursement, and a large volume of cash circulation. The loan scale of Lake Town Industrial and Commercial Bank had exceeded its limits, borrowed funds were due, and the bank was in dire need of funds. However, most enterprises were unaware of this situation and were still stuck in the vortex of unreasonable product structure, poor fund turnover, and high demand for funds. What should be done? Zhou Boshuang sought the opinions of relevant leaders in the municipal government and decided to “open up” to the enterprises, providing them with financial information. By holding regular financial press conferences, the state’s credit policies and financial situation were quickly conveyed to the enterprises; the enterprises’ fund needs and production and operation trends were also quickly fed back to the bank.

Since the early 1950s, Zhou Boshuang has been closely associated with banking work. He has served as the manager of a banking branch, engaged in credit, planning, and other professional work. After the Gang of Four was smashed, he served as the deputy president of the Agricultural Bank of Lishui, Zhejiang. In 1986, Zhou Boshuang was transferred to Lake Town and took up the position of president of the Industrial and Commercial Bank. In 1988, he was named a model worker of the city and has since published more than ten academic papers. In recent years, with the advancement of financial reform and the intensification of financial competition, he has been more outstanding in attracting customers and depositing funds. He advocates for shaping the image of a financial enterprise and expanding the bank’s social influence.

In the bank’s various work, savings and the relationship with the public are the most closely related. Zhou Boshuang requires employees to adhere to the principle of “customer first” and pay attention to maintaining the image of the Industrial and Commercial Bank when handling business. Once, a savings branch had an argument between an employee and a customer, causing the customer to leave in anger. Zhou Boshuang learned about this and immediately had a talk with the employee. Later, the employee went to the customer’s home to sincerely apologize. The neighbors heard about this and were very moved, saying, “You are not just attracting deposits, but also winning the hearts of the people!”

    塑造金融企业的形象
    ——记湖州市工商银行行长周柏祥
    本报记者　施明慎
      “喂，张厂长，明天工商银行举行金融发布会，你去不去？”“去，你也去吧？”“去，一定去。”今年3月，湖州市举办金融发布会前，两位企业家如此对话。
    迄今，金融发布会已开过三次，主讲人是湖州市工商银行行长、高级经济师周柏祥，听讲的是该市数百家企业的厂长经理和财务干部。
    首次金融发布会是去年7月召开的。当时全国面临货币投放过多，货款发放过猛、现金流通量过大的严峻形势。湖州市工商银行贷款规模突破，拆借资金到期，资金十分紧缺。而多数企业对这种情势全然不知，依然陷在产品结构不合理、资金周转不灵、资金需求旺盛的漩涡中。怎么办？周柏祥征求了市政府有关领导的意见，决定向企业“交底”，给他们沟通金融信息。通过定期举办金融发布会，国家的信贷政策、金融形势很快传达到企业；企业的资金需求，生产经营动向也迅速反馈给银行。
    从50年代初期起，周柏祥就和银行工作结下了不解之缘。他当过银行的营业所主任，从事过信贷、计划等专业工作，粉碎“四人帮”以后，他曾任浙江丽水地区农业银行副行长。1986年，周柏祥调到湖州，担任工商银行行长。1988年他被评为市劳动模范，至今已发表10余篇学术论文。近几年，随着金融改革的推进，金融竞争激烈展开，在争取客户，吸收存款方面表现更为突出。他主张塑造金融企业的形象，扩大银行的社会影响。
    在银行的各项工作中，储蓄和群众的关系最密切。周柏祥要求职工遵循“顾客至上”的宗旨，在处理业务时注意维护工商银行的形象。一次储蓄所有位营业员和顾客口角起来，使顾客忿忿离去。周柏祥知道后，马上找她谈话。后来这位营业员到顾客家里诚恳道歉，附近居民听到此事都非常感动，说你们吸收的不仅是存款，还有民心啊！
