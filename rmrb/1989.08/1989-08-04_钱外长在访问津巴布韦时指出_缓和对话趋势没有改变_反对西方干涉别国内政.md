Xinhua News Agency, Harare, August 3rd.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is visiting here, stated today that we must oppose the actions of certain Western countries interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

Reporters learned from individuals accompanying Qian Qichen on his visit that during his talks with Zimbabwe's Acting Foreign Minister Mangwende, Qian Qichen said that the current trend of détente and dialogue in the international situation has not changed. It is worth noting that some Western countries are attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Qian Qichen further pointed out that the trend of détente and dialogue, especially the détente in U.S.-Soviet relations, has reduced the level of East-West confrontation and cooled down conflicts in "hotspot" regions, but global contradictions and tensions have not been eliminated. Certain Western powers are attempting to exploit problems arising in some countries during their reforms and development, to infiltrate and interfere. We must remain vigilant against such situations.

Qian Qichen added, "Despite this, China will not change its established policies. China will continue to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, continue to adhere to reform and opening up, and will not return to the old path of closing doors and isolating itself. China is not afraid and will never yield to external forces. We will walk our own path and build socialism with Chinese characteristics."

Qian Qichen said, "China advocates that countries with different social systems, different traditional cultures, and different values should cooperate on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and establish a new international political order."

Mangwende fully agreed with Qian Qichen's views. He said, "Although Zimbabwe is a young developing country, the people of Zimbabwe are proud to be the true masters of their own country. Zimbabwe fully understands China's stance against foreign interference in its internal affairs."

Both sides also exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues in Southern Africa. Mangwende hopes that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, will play a greater role in resolving issues in Southern Africa.

    钱外长在访问津巴布韦时指出
    缓和对话趋势没有改变  反对西方干涉别国内政
    本报哈拉雷8月3日电　记者李景卫、新华社记者张敬雷报道：正在这里访问的中国外长钱其琛今天指出，要反对有些西方国家干涉别国内政的行动。
    记者从陪同钱其琛访问的人士那里获悉，中国外长钱其琛在同津巴布韦代理外长曼关迪举行会谈时说，当前国际局势中出现的缓和和对话趋势没有改变。值得注意的是有的西方国家企图对别国内政进行干涉。
    钱其琛进一步指出，缓和和对话的潮流，特别是美苏关系的缓和，使东西方对抗的程度降低，使“热点”地区的冲突降温，但世界矛盾和紧张因素尚未消除。某些西方大国正企图利用一些国家在改革和发展中出现的一些问题，进行渗透、干涉。对这种情况应当保持警惕。
    钱其琛又说，尽管如此，中国不会因此而改变自己的既定政策。中国将继续执行独立自主的和平外交政策，继续坚持改革开放，中国不会回到闭关锁国的老路上去。中国不怕也决不会屈服于外来势力。我们将走自己的路，建设有中国特色的社会主义。
    钱其琛说，中国主张世界上具有不同社会制度、不同传统文化和不同价值观念的国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上进行合作，建立国际政治新秩序。
    曼关迪对钱其琛阐述的观点表示完全同意。他说，津巴布韦虽是一个年轻的发展中国家，但津巴布韦人民为自己是国家真正的主人感到骄傲。津巴布韦完全理解中国反对外国干涉其内政所持的立场。
    双方还就双边关系和南部非洲问题交换了看法。曼关迪希望中国作为联合国安理会常任理事国，在解决南部非洲问题上进一步发挥作用。
