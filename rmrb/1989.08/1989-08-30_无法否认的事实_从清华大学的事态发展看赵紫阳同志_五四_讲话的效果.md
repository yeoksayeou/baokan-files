The historic Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party exposed the serious errors committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party during the anti-Party and anti-socialist disturbances. Among these, his speech on May 4th to the representatives of the "Asian Development Bank" meeting sent out a voice completely different from the Central Committee's stance and policies, publicly exposing the internal disagreements within the Central Committee to the world, and became the turning point for the rapid escalation of the turmoil.

On the evening of May 4th, around 11 PM, two reporters from the People's Daily and the China Youth Daily separately went to Tsinghua University to conduct overnight interviews with the school's leaders and students regarding their reactions to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech.

The next day, May 5th, both the People's Daily and the China Youth Daily published Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech and their respective interview reports on the front page. The People's Daily's headline was "Capital Universities' Teachers and Students Welcome Zhao Ziyang's Speech," and the China Youth Daily's headline was "Zhao Ziyang's Speech Gains Wide Acclaim." On May 6th, the People's Daily again published a positive reflection on the front page with the prominent headline "Capital Universities Resume Classes Starting Yesterday, Zhao Ziyang's Speech Sparks Positive Response," and used students' words to say: "After hearing Zhao Ziyang's speech, I feel that the strike should be put to an end." This linked Zhao Ziyang's speech with the resumption of classes, creating the impression that the speech was the "cause" and the resumption of classes was the "effect." On the same day, the China Youth Daily published an article titled "The Heart of the Party, the Heart of the People, the Heart of the Youth" featuring interviews with "socially renowned figures and scholars" such as Hu Jizhi, Yan Jiya, and Cao Siyuan regarding their "thoughts" on Zhao Ziyang's speech. They both "approved" and were "happy," believing that the speech had made significant progress in handling the student parade issue, "reflected the Party's correct attitude in handling this issue," and was "a manifestation of the Party and its leaders' rationality, maturity, and confidence." In short, the newspapers at that time were filled with praise.

However, many cadres, Party members, and staff in institutions of higher learning had evaluations completely opposite to the propaganda in the newspapers regarding Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech. On the evening of May 4th, after the TV station broadcast the news of this speech, many comrades at Tsinghua University immediately sensed: "The Central Committee's tone has changed!" Especially for the cadres, teachers, and student activists on the front lines of student work, they suddenly felt at a loss, unable to adapt, and under a tremendous invisible pressure. Many comrades angrily said: "The General Secretary is playing the good guy upstairs, letting us be the bad guys downstairs," "His speech has sold out the Beijing Municipal Committee, the school Party Committee, and all of us!" Some comrades also requested the school Party Committee to report upwards: "Now there are two voices in the Central Committee, whose should we listen to? With which Central Committee should we maintain consistency?" Some comrades also sadly mentioned: We do our work at the grassroots level, fearing the most is the change in the tone from above, making us neither inside nor outside. Now the most feared thing has happened, how can we do our work! Unfortunately, Zhao Ziyang did not want to listen to these unwelcome words at all.

Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. How effective was Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech? Only facts can provide the answer. In Chen Xitong's report on "The Situation Regarding the Suppression of Turmoil and the Counterrevolutionary Riot" on June 30th, it has been convincingly argued with irrefutable facts that Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech was the turning point for the escalation of the turmoil. The situation at Tsinghua University is similar.

The editorial "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" published in the People's Daily on April 26th helped the majority of cadres understand the nature of this disturbance and clarified the direction of work; it also gave the organizers and planners of the turmoil a wake-up call, forcing them to change their strategies and slogans. After they organized the large parade on April 27th, the student movement and turmoil began to show a clear downward trend. At that time, the illegal student self-governing "preparatory committee" at Tsinghua University also announced its dissolution, and the leaders resigned en masse, with some admitting their mistakes to the school. Many students who participated in the student movement initially did not understand the editorial's characterization of the turmoil and were emotionally agitated, but after various efforts, they gradually calmed down, and some students felt that they could no longer continue the disturbance, with more and more students demanding to resume classes. On April 27th, more than 2,000 students from Tsinghua University participated in the parade, but by May 4th, the number of participants had decreased to less than a thousand. From May 1st to 4th, the regular spring holiday was observed. On May 5th, after completing various preparations, the school began to resume classes, with the attendance rate on the first day reaching over 85%. During the week of resumption, 80% to 90% of undergraduate students persisted in attending classes, and almost all graduate students attended classes. The undergraduate graduation design and graduate thesis work were also fully resumed. At that time, many cadres and teachers in the school felt that the students' emotions had stabilized, and the situation had significantly improved. With more work, the incident could be resolved.

However, Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech, after being hyped up by some newspapers, caused serious confusion among the majority of cadres and the masses. The organizers and planners of the turmoil were inspired, discovering a "turning point" and seeing hope, and they intensified their plots and arrangements to escalate the turmoil. That night, the leaders of the "self-governing committees" of Peking University and Beijing Normal University announced their resumption of the strike. On May 9th, Beijing Normal University spread the news of an impending "hunger strike." In the evening, about 200 students from Peking University came to Tsinghua University to incite an immediate strike and demanded a parade the next day to support the journalists on the streets. The leaders of the original "preparatory committee" of Tsinghua University, who had "resigned," also became active again and secretly intensified their contact with the "High Autonomy Federation." On the morning of May 10th, a core member of the "High Autonomy Federation" at Tsinghua University distributed more than 200 round-neck short-sleeved T-shirts on campus as a sign for the parade organized by the "High Autonomy Federation" that day. Some students originally thought they might have been wrong, but now they felt that the General Secretary had affirmed us, and we were not wrong. However, the majority of cadres and teachers were left in a difficult and embarrassing situation by Zhao Ziyang's speech, unable to actively and clearly do their work. On May 13th, the situation finally deteriorated, the turmoil escalated rapidly, and a large-scale hunger strike in Tiananmen Square that was difficult to control occurred, eventually leading to a counterrevolutionary riot. Tsinghua University also paid a heavy price for this.

From the above facts and brief analysis, it is clear that Zhao Ziyang's "May 4th" speech, whether in Beijing or at Tsinghua University, was indeed the turning point that reversed the situation and escalated the turmoil, playing a detrimental role in supporting the enemy, confusing the masses, suppressing cadres, and splitting the Central Committee. This is the objective effect of the "May 4th" speech. This is something that no one can deny.

    无法否认的事实
    ——从清华大学的事态发展看赵紫阳同志“五四”讲话的效果
    清华大学　殷竹
    具有重大历史意义的党的十三届四中全会，揭露了赵紫阳同志在反党反社会主义的动乱中所犯的支持动乱、分裂党的严重错误。其中，他在5月4日对“亚行”会议各国代表的讲话，发出了同中央的立场和方针完全不同的声音，公开把中央内部分歧暴露于世，成了动乱急剧升级的转折点。
    5月4日晚11时许，人民日报和中国青年报各有两位记者分别到清华园连夜采访学校领导和师生对赵紫阳同志“五四”讲话的反应。
    第二天，即5月5日，人民日报、中国青年报都在头版同时发表了赵紫阳同志的“五四”讲话和各自的采访报道，人民日报的标题是《首都高校师生欢迎赵紫阳讲话》，中国青年报的标题是《赵紫阳的讲话获得广泛好评》。5月6日，人民日报在头版头条再次发表正面反映，冠以《首都高校昨日起陆续复课，赵紫阳讲话引起积极反响》的醒目标题，并借用学生的话说：“听了赵紫阳的讲话，我觉得罢课应打上个句号了。”把赵紫阳的讲话和学生复课这两件事联系在一起，制造讲话是“因”、复课是“果”的印象。同日，中国青年报又以《党心·民心·青年之心》为题，发表了记者采访胡绩伟、严家其、曹思源等“社会知名人士和学者”对赵紫阳讲话的“感想”。他们既“赞成”，又“高兴”，认为这个讲话在处理学生游行问题上“有了很大进步”，“反映了党在处理这个问题上的正确态度”，“这是我们党及其领导人理智、成熟、有信心的表现”。总之，当时的报纸上是一片赞扬之声。
    但是，对赵紫阳同志的“五四”讲话，高等学校的很多干部、党员和教工却有着与报纸的宣传截然相反的评价。5月4日晚，当电视台播出这篇讲话的消息后，清华大学的很多同志立即敏锐地感觉到：“中央的调子变了！”特别是在第一线做学生工作的干部、教师和学生中的积极分子顿时感到不知所措，无所适从，有一种无形的巨大压力。不少同志气愤地说：“总书记在上面做好人，让我们在下面当恶人”，“他这一讲，把北京市委、学校党委和我们全给卖了！”有些同志还要求学校党委向上反映：“现在中央有两个声音，我们到底听谁的？同哪个中央保持一致？”有的同志还非常伤心地谈到：我们在基层做工作，最怕上面的调子变来变去，搞得我们里外不是人。现在最担心的事又发生了，我们再怎么做工作！遗憾的是，对这些逆耳之音，赵紫阳同志根本不愿意听。
    实践是检验真理的唯一标准。赵紫阳同志“五四”讲话的效果如何？只能由事实作出回答。6月30日陈希同同志所做的《关于制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的情况报告》中，已经用确凿的事实，令人信服地论证了赵紫阳同志的“五四”讲话是动乱升级的转折点。从清华大学的情况看也是如此。
    人民日报4月26日社论《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》的发表，使广大干部认清了这场风波的性质，明确了工作的方向；也给动乱的组织者和策划者以当头棒喝，迫使他们不得不改变策略，变更口号。在他们组织了4月27日大游行之后，学潮和动乱已开始呈现明显下降趋势。当时，清华大学非法组织学生自治“筹委会”也宣布解散，头头们纷纷辞职，有的向学校承认错误。许多参与学潮的学生，开始对社论关于动乱的定性不理解，情绪一度比较激烈，经过各方面的工作后也逐步平静了下来，有些同学已感到不能再闹了，要求复课的同学越来越多。4月27日清华大学有2000余名学生参加游行，到5月4日的游行参加者已减到不足千人。5月1日至4日按常规放了春假。5月5日，学校在做了各项准备工作之后开始复课，第一天的上课率即达85％以上。在复课的一周内，本科生有80％—90％的同学坚持上课，研究生基本上都上课了，本科生的毕业设计和研究生的毕业论文工作也全面恢复。当时，学校的许多干部、教师都觉得，同学们的情绪已趋稳定，局势大为缓和，再做一些工作，事态就可以平息了。
    但是，赵紫阳同志的“五四”讲话经过一些报纸的大肆渲染，在广大干部、群众中造成了严重的思想混乱。动乱的组织者和策划者从中受到了鼓舞，他们发现了“转机”，看到了希望，又加紧了使动乱升级的密谋和部署。当晚，北大和北师大“自治会”的头头就重新宣布罢课。5月9日，北师大就传出要“绝食”的消息。晚上，北大约200名学生到清华大学煽动立即罢课，并要求第二天上街游行，以支援上街的新闻工作者。清华大学的原已“辞职”的“筹委会”的一些头头也重新活跃起来，并暗中加紧了与“高自联”的联系。5月10日上午，清华大学的一个“高自联”骨干在校内发了200多件圆领短袖背心，作为当天“高自联”组织的游行的标志。一些学生原来觉得自己可能错了，现在又觉得总书记肯定了我们，我们没有错。而广大干部、教师却被赵紫阳同志的讲话搞得左右为难，陷入被动尴尬的处境，无法主动地、旗帜鲜明地做工作。5月13日，事态终于恶性发展，动乱急剧升级，出现了在天安门广场搞大规模绝食的难以收拾的局面，最后又发展到反革命暴乱，清华大学也为此付出了沉重代价。
    从以上的事实和简要分析中，我们可以清楚地看出，赵紫阳同志的“五四”讲话，无论是从北京还是从清华大学来说，都确实是使局势逆转、动乱升级的转折点，起到了支持敌人、迷惑群众、压制干部、分裂中央的恶劣作用。这就是“五四”讲话所起的客观效果。这是谁也无法否认的。
