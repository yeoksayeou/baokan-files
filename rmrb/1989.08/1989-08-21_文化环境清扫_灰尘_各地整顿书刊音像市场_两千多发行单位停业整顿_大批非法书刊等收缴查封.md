		National efforts have been made recently to thoroughly rectify the markets for books, periodicals, and audio-visual products, resulting in an initial improvement in the cultural environment.

		In response to the rampant spread of obscene and other problematic publications, the State Press and Publication Administration issued an "Emergency Notice on Inspecting and Rectifying the Book and Periodical Market" on July 11. According to incomplete statistics, over the course of more than a month, local authorities dispatched over 65,000 inspectors, checked nearly 40,000 distribution points, shut down 2,300 unlicensed operators, revoked more than 100 licenses of violators, and ordered over 2,000 distribution units to suspend operations for rectification. They also seized and sealed 90,000 obscene and illegal videotapes and over 11.34 million problematic books and periodicals. The public security authorities have initiated legal proceedings against a number of cases involving the production and trafficking of obscene publications or illegal publishing activities.

		The public has widely praised this campaign to clean up the publication market, saying it is long overdue.

    据新华社北京8月21日电　全国各地近来采取切实措施，大力整顿书刊和音像制品市场，使文化环境初步得到了净化。
    针对淫秽等出版物泛滥成灾的状况，新闻出版署于7月11日下发了《关于检查、整顿书刊市场的紧急通知》。据不完全统计，各地在一个多月时间内，共出动检查人员65000多人次，检查发行网点近4万家，取缔无照经营者2300人（家），吊销了100多个违纪经营者的营业执照，对有问题的2000多个发行单位实行停业整顿，收缴查封黄色和非法录像带9万多盒、各种有问题的书刊1134万多册。一批制作、贩卖淫秽出版物或非法出版活动的案件已由公安机关立案审理。
    对于这场清理出版物市场的行动，群众都拍手快称，认为早就应该这样抓了。
