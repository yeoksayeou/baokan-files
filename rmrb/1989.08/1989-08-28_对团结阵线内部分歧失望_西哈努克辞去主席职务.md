Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 27th.

Sihanouk's spokesman in France announced on August 27th in Paris that Prince Sihanouk has resigned from the chairmanship of the United Front, which belongs to his faction.

It is reported that the chairmanship of the National United Front of Cambodia for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia has been jointly assumed by Sihanouk's wife, Princess Monik, and former Prime Minister Norodom Sihanouk. Additionally, Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, will take over Monik's role as Secretary-General.

In a letter to the "Front," Sihanouk revealed that he resigned due to his disappointment with the internal divisions within the United Front during the Paris International Conference on Peace in Cambodia.

However, Sihanouk stated that he remains the supreme commander of the Sihanouk National Army.

Sihanouk has been the chairman of the United Front since 1981.
