	Family planning as a criterion for evaluating advanced units
	Anqiu implements a "one-vote veto system"

	Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 13th - (Reporter Zhang Bai Xin, Correspondent Zhang Xi Yu) Anqiu County, Shandong Province, has implemented family planning policies effectively. Starting this year, during the performance evaluation of various departments, units, and party members and cadres, a "one-vote veto system" for family planning has been put in place.

	In the past, family planning was only a "soft indicator" in performance evaluations. Some departments did not enforce family planning policies effectively but were still rated as advanced units. Starting this year, the Anqiu County Committee and County Government have made family planning work an important criterion in the selection of advanced units, civilized units, outstanding party branches, advanced individuals, and model Communist Party members. Those who perform poorly in this area will be disqualified from the selection. Previously selected advanced units have also undergone comprehensive evaluations, and those that did not meet family planning targets have had their honorary titles revoked.

	After implementing this measure, various units have formulated corresponding policies and implemented family planning responsibility systems. Over 1,400 villages in the county have appointed family planning inspectors. Those who violate family planning policies will be severely dealt with. A deputy township head in Huichu Township was disciplined for violating family planning policies.

### 计划生育作为评先进依据  安丘实行“一票否决制”

    计划生育作为评先进依据
    安丘实行“一票否决制”
    新华社济南8月13日电　（记者张百新、通讯员张锡玉）山东省安丘县把计划生育政策落到实处，今年起，对各部门、单位和党员、干部进行政绩考核时，实行计划生育“一票否决制”。
    过去在政绩考核中计划生育只是一项“软指标”，有些部门执行计划生育政策不力，仍被评为先进单位。安丘县委、县政府从今年起，在评选先进单位、文明单位、优秀党支部、先进个人和模范共产党员时，把计划生育工作作为一项重要的依据。凡做得不好的，一律取消评选资格。过去评选的先进单位也组织了全面考核，没有完成计划生育指标的，一律撤销其荣誉称号。
    这一办法实施后，各单位纷纷制定相应政策，落实计划生育责任制。全县1400多个村，都配备了计划生育巡视员，凡违反计划生育政策的，一律严肃处理。辉渠乡的一名副乡长违犯计划生育政策，受到行政处分。
