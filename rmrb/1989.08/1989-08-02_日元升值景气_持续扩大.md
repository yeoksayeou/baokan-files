The "yen appreciation boom" has been continuing for the 32nd month, and it is currently expanding further. It may become Japan's second major post-war economic boom.

Japan's Economic Planning Agency revealed that as of July, domestic demand in Japan remains robust, corporate profits have increased further, and employment conditions have improved. Prices are generally stable, and personal consumption has also increased. Therefore, the agency believes that the Japanese economy, which has been recovering since November 1986, is still expanding. It has already surpassed the so-called "Showa 54 boom" from November 1979 to June 1982, becoming the third major post-war economic boom.

   “日元升值景气”持续扩大
    新华社东京7月30日电  日本官方公布的统计资料表明，已经进入第32个月的“日元升值景气”目前仍在进一步扩大，有可能成为日本战后的第2个大型景气。
    日本经济企划厅透露，到7月份为止，日本国内需求坚挺，企业收益进一步增加，就业状况也有所改善。物价基本上平稳，个人消费也有所增加。因此该厅认为，从1986年11月开始回升的日本经济目前仍在继续扩大，已经超过1979年11月至1982年6月的所谓“神武景气”，成为战后的第3个大型景气。
