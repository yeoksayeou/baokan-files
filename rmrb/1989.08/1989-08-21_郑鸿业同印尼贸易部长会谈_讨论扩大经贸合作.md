Zheng Hongye, the acting president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, met with Indonesian Trade Minister Arifin Siregar today morning during his friendly visit to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. The two sides exchanged views on further expanding economic and trade cooperation between China and Indonesia.

During the meeting, both sides agreed that China and Indonesia are both developing countries in Asia with vast territories, large populations, and abundant resources, and that there is enormous potential for bilateral economic and trade cooperation.

Siregar said that the key now is how to further tap into these potentials. He said that the Indonesian government encourages the development of economic and trade relations with socialist countries, especially with China. Due to historical reasons, Indonesian business circles are more familiar with and understand China's economy and products than with other socialist countries. Therefore, Indonesia's economic relations with China should develop faster than with other socialist countries. He expressed optimism about this.

Zheng Hongye reviewed the development of economic and trade relations between China and Indonesia since the resumption of direct trade in 1985. He expressed appreciation for Indonesian President Suharto's statement in February this year that he wanted to normalize relations with China and his speech on August 16 about the normalization process of the two countries not being affected. He also expressed gratitude for the friendly stance taken by the Indonesian government towards China's efforts to quell unrest and riots.

    郑鸿业同印尼贸易部长会谈
    讨论扩大经贸合作
    新华社新加坡8月21日电  （记者李永明）正在印度尼西亚首都雅加达进行友好访问的中国国际贸促会代会长郑鸿业，今天上午拜会了印尼贸易部长阿里芬·西雷加尔，双方就进一步扩大中、印尼两国经济与贸易合作问题交换了意见。
    会谈中，双方一致认为，中、印尼两国都是亚洲发展中国家，幅员广大、人口众多、资源丰富，双边经济贸易与技术合作的潜力巨大。
    西雷加尔说，现在的关键问题是如何进一步挖掘这些潜力。他说，印尼政府鼓励发展同社会主义国家、特别是同中国的经济贸易关系。由于历史的原因，印尼企业界对中国的经济和产品比对其他社会主义国家更熟悉和更了解。因此，印尼同中国的经济关系应比同其他社会主义国家发展得更快。他对此感到乐观。
    郑鸿业在会谈中，首先回顾了中、印尼两国自1985年恢复直接贸易以来双方经贸关系的发展。他对印尼总统苏哈托今年2月表示要与中国关系正常化和8月16日发表演说时关于两国关系正常化进程不受影响的讲话表示赞赏，并对印尼政府对我国平息动乱和暴乱所采取的友好立场表示感谢。
