Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 7th.

The China Consumer Association recently organized a team to test 16 brands of instant noodles sold in Beijing markets. After testing five items, it was found that Wan Shou Shan, Fu Yu, Hua Feng, and Jing Hua brands scored the highest, while Wu Ting, Jing Chun, Bai Tian E, and Shang Jie brands scored the lowest.

According to the Consumer Association's published results, the five testing items are: 1) packaging and labeling, 2) measurement and pricing, 3) hygiene, 4) maturity and rehydration, and 5) sensory evaluation.

It was reported that this test found that among the 16 brands, 5 had no production date, 4 had no address, and 2 did not indicate the weight. For example, the Shang Jie brand from Zhengzhou uses manual sealing, which affects both the appearance and storage quality. Another example is the Beijing Jing Chun brand, which is labeled as 100 grams but actually weighs only 74.5 grams, with a 25.5% error.

Hygiene testing showed that all 16 instant noodle samples met the relevant department's hygiene standards. The samples were purchased by Consumer Association staff from Beijing retail stores in the guise of ordinary consumers.

However, price testing showed that the lowest and highest prices of these instant noodles differed by 2.6 times.

Regarding this, relevant officials believe that although the quality of instant noodle seasoning varies, the price difference is so significant that it warrants the attention of industrial and commercial enterprises.

    从北京零售商店购买样品
    消费者协会检测方便面
    新华社北京8月7日电  中国消费者协会最近组织专人对北京市场上销售的16种牌号的方便面进行检测，经过五个项目的检测表明，万寿山、浮玉、华丰和京花牌方便面得分最高，五亭、京春、白天鹅和上街牌方便面得分最低。
    据“消协”公布的五个检测项目是，一，外包装及标志说明，二，计量与价格，三，卫生情况，四，成熟度与复水性，五，感观评议。
    据称，这次检测发现，在16种牌号的方便面中，有5个无生产日期、4个无厂址、2个未标明重量。例如郑州上街牌方便面以手工封口，既影响外观，也影响贮藏质量。又如北京京春牌方便面，标重100克，实际只有74.5克，误差25.5％。
    卫生检测表明，16种方便面样品均符合有关部门的卫生标准，样品均由消费者协会工作人员以普通消费者身份在北京零售商店购买。
    但价格检测表明，这些方便面最低价和最高价相差2.6倍。
    对此有关人士认为，尽管方便面调料质量不同，但差价如此悬殊，值得引起工商企业的注意。
