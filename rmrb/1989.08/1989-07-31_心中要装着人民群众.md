Title: Keep the People in Mind

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed to "concretely do a few things that the people are generally concerned about." This is both the people's earnest expectation of the Party and a non-negotiable requirement that the Party has put forth for all levels of leadership and cadres.

Concretely doing things for the people is determined by the nature of our Party and the system of our country, and it is a tradition of the Party and the government. Over the past few decades, the Party and the government have done this, and especially in the ten years of reform, the results have been more pronounced. However, why do the people feel so close and happy when they hear this phrase? The reason probably lies in two points: First, our modernization construction faces a heavy task, and there are too many things to do. The people have a multitude of problems (including political, economic, and social life issues), regardless of whether they can actually be solved, but people hope to see solutions; Second, in the cadre team, many people have a weak sense of serving the people, and things that should be done are not done. Among these comrades, some are officials who are high above the people, not uniting the responsibility to superiors with the responsibility to the people; some are selfish, with quick information and many methods, but when it comes to the people's affairs, they emphasize difficulties and contradictions, delaying decisions; some like to flatter the crowd, shouting loudly in meetings but not following through afterwards. For example, building bridges, solving drinking water problems, and constructing toilets, which directly relate to the people's interests and have the conditions to be done, are not even worth considering. Such phenomena inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the people. Because the people are practical, they use visible and tangible deeds to measure and examine our cadres. Therefore, to gain the trust of the people, we must concretely do things for the people.

What needs to be done, what can be delayed, and what cannot be done, all require our cadres to go to the practical field to investigate and study, listen to the people's voices, understand the people's sentiments, and have a clear mind. For the problems that the people are generally concerned about and urgently need to be solved, we must strive to solve them; for problems that cannot be solved temporarily, do not make empty promises, but explain clearly to the people and seek their understanding and support. However, we must not use "explanation" as an excuse to delay solving problems that should be solved.

Concretely doing things for the people is the duty of the leadership and cadres. How a region, an industry, or a unit performs depends on whether the leadership cadres truly have the people and the Four Modernizations in mind.

    心中要装着人民群众
    党的十三届四中全会提出“切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情”，这既是人民群众对党的殷切期望，又是党对各级领导机关和领导干部提出非办不可的要求。
    切实为人民群众办实事，这是由我们党的性质和国家制度所决定的，是党和政府的传统。几十年来，党和政府也是这样做的，尤其在十年改革中，成效更为显著。但是，为什么现在群众听了这句话后，却感到那么亲切高兴、对自己心思？原因恐怕有两条：一是我国现代化建设面临着繁重的任务，要办的事情太多，群众中各种各样问题（包括政治的、经济的、社会生活的等）一大堆，不管事实上能不能办得了，但人们希望得到解决；二是在干部队伍中，不少人为人民服务的观念淡薄了，该办的事情不办。在这些同志中，有的为官一方，高高在上，没有把对上级负责和对群众负责一致起来；有的谋起私利来，信息灵，办法多，而涉及到群众的事，则强调这困难，那矛盾，久拖不决；有的喜欢哗众取宠，会上哇哇叫，会后不对号，诸如修桥铺路、解决饮水、修建厕所等直接关系群众利益又有条件办的事，却不屑一顾。如此种种，势必引起群众的不满。因为群众是讲求实际的，他们用看得见、摸得着的实事来衡量、考察我们的干部。所以我们要取信于民，必须切实为人民群众办实事。
    哪些事需要办，哪些事要缓办，哪些事不能办，就需要我们的干部到实际中去调查研究，听取群众呼声，了解群众情绪，做到心中有数。对于当前人民群众普遍关心、最迫切需要解决的问题，一定要千方百计地去解决；暂时解决不了的问题，不要随便许愿，应向群众解释清楚，求得群众的谅解和支持。但是，绝不能对该解决的问题也以“解释”为托辞，拖着不办。
    切实为人民群众办实事是领导机关和领导干部的天职。一个地区、一个行业、一个单位做得如何，关键在于那里的领导干部心中是否真正装着人民群众，装着四化大业。
