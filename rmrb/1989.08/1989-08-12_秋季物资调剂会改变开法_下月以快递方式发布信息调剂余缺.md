    The autumn commodity exchange fair will change its format this year. Several major newspapers in Beijing, including "China Commodities News," "Economic Reference News," and "Market News," have decided to reform the traditional method of holding procurement fairs. They plan to hold the 1989 autumn national inventory commodity exchange fair in a new way by transmitting information remotely.

    This fair will not convene purchasing agents and sales representatives in person. Instead, over the next month, they will collect data on inventory situations from enterprises across the country, categorize and organize the information, and then input it into a computer for storage. The printed and bound materials will be sent via express mail to registered participants on September 25. Participants can then use these materials for inquiries, selection, negotiations, and timely adjustment of surplus and deficit commodities.

    The organizers stated that this exchange fair, unrestricted by the number of participants, will be larger in scale than previous ones. It will also not be limited by industry or department. Whether it is hardware tools, household appliances, chemicals, textiles, or building materials, all will be categorized and indexed for cross-industry exchange.

    The organizers require participating enterprises to pay service fees for printing and transmitting materials. However, the organizers cannot guarantee profitability this time. According to the contract, if the fair incurs a loss, the organizers will share the deficit. They also expressed their intention to experiment with using telephone conferences and video conferences to further reform the procurement fair format in the future.

    The conference organizing committee is based in Beijing. The indexing group is responsible for disassembling, categorizing, and indexing all enterprise materials, and recording the enterprise names, commodity names, models, quantities, and reference prices according to the classification of inventory commodities. The input group will then use computers to input the indexed materials onto floppy disks. This processing method is said to ensure the timeliness of the information.

### 秋季物资调剂会改变开法  下月以快递方式发布信息调剂余缺

    秋季物资调剂会改变开法
    下月以快递方式发布信息调剂余缺
    据新华社北京8月12日电　（记者吴锦才）《中国物资报》、《经济参考》、《市场报》等首都几家报社尝试改革一下订货会的开法。他们近日决定1989年秋季的全国库存物资调剂会由传统的模式改为异地传递信息的方式举行。
    这次会不召集采购员、推销员见面，而是从现在开始用一个月的时间收集资料，把全国各地企业的库存物资情况进行整理分类，再输入计算机存储、打印后装订成册。会议决定9月25日为信息发布日——当日将综合资料汇编好全部用邮政特快专递方式寄给会议报名参加者，供查询、选择、洽谈，及时调剂余缺。
    主办者称，此次调剂会的规模因为不受人数限制所以开得超过以往，范围也不再受行业、部门限制，无论是五金工具、家用电器，还是化工、纺织、建筑材料，都将被分类检索进行跨行业交流。
    主办者要求会议的参加企业交付包括资料的打印、传递等项目的服务费用。但主办者现在说不准这次会议能否赢利，因此按合同规定，此次会议如果亏本，亏损额将由主办者分摊。主办者还表示今后将试验利用电话会议、电视会议等形式改革订货会的开法。
    这次会议的会务组设在北京，其中的检索组负责将全部企业资料进行拆读、分类、检索，按照库存物资的分类将与会企业、物资名称、型号、数量、参考价格等登记造册；录入组则用计算机将检索过的资料录入软盘。这种处理方式据称可以保证信息具有时效。
