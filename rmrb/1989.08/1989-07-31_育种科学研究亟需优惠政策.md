Our city is the origin and breeding base for compact-type corn seeds in the country. In 1982, our city provided 100 million kilograms of high-quality seeds annually to more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, with a cumulative planting area of over 40 million mu, increasing grain production by over 5 billion kilograms. Our city's high-quality corn seeds have basically been promoted nationwide.

In recent years, due to the severe shortage of agricultural materials, our city's breeding research and seed production work have encountered various difficulties. A responsible person from the Municipal Agricultural Science Research Institute said that to ensure the smooth completion of this year's scientific research projects, they have repeatedly submitted reports to the Municipal Planning Commission, Municipal Government, and Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative. However, the agricultural materials urgently needed by the breeding research institute are still in short supply. The several ten thousand mu of seed production bases of the Municipal Seed Company are also facing difficulties due to the lack of agricultural materials. We appeal to the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and relevant departments to take measures to implement preferential policies for agricultural scientific research departments and ensure the supply of agricultural materials.

    育种科学研究亟需优惠政策
    我市是全国紧凑型玉米种子的发源地和制种繁育基地。1982年，我市每年向全国20多个省、市、自治区提供良种1亿多公斤，累计播种面积达4000多万亩，增产粮食50多亿公斤。我市的玉米良种基本上推广到全国。
    近几年来，由于农用物资的严重短缺，使我市的育种研究和制种工作出现了种种困扰。市农业科学研究所一位负责同志说，为确保今年的科研项目顺利完成，他们先后向市计委、市政府和市供销社打了多次报告，但是育种研究所急需的农用物资仍十分紧缺。市种子公司的几万亩制种基地，由于缺少农用物资，也面临困境。呼吁市委、市政府和有关部门采取措施，对农业科研部门实行优惠政策，保证农用物资供应。
