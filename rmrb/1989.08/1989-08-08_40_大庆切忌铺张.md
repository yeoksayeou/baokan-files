In just over a month, the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China will arrive. It is understood that, in preparation for the 40th anniversary celebrations, many places have already begun to take action: some are holding exhibitions, others are organizing large-scale street performances, and some are planning large-scale lantern festivals for entire industries, requiring the lanterns to be tall, exquisite, and cutting-edge. Additionally, some are mandating that various enterprises contribute funds for regional sports and cultural competitions.

During the 40th anniversary celebrations, it is necessary to hold activities that reflect the achievements of our country over the past 40 years, especially the past 10 years of reform and opening up, to propagate the superiority of the socialist system, and to boost the morale of the people. However, at present, the country is facing economic difficulties, many enterprises are short of funds, and many projects have been forced to halt. Everyone is tightening their belts. Under these circumstances, if we do not consider the objective conditions and merely pursue so-called grandeur and excitement, I believe this is not a wise move. During the 40th anniversary celebrations, I think we should try to spend as little money as possible on economic expenditures and embody the spirit of thrift. This has also been a practice that our Party has consistently advocated for many years.

    40大庆切忌铺张
    再过一个多月，新中国成立40周年的纪念日就到了。据了解，为40大庆，不少地方已行动起来：有的举办展览，有的搞大型街头歌舞，有的准备搞全行业大型灯展，要求花灯高、精、尖，有的摊派各企业出资搞地区性各种文体比赛。
    在40大庆期间，搞一些反映我国40年来特别是改革开放10年来的成就活动，宣传社会主义制度的优越性，鼓舞群众的斗志，是必要的。然而，眼下国家正处在经济困难时期，不少企业资金紧缺，许多项目被迫下马，大家都在过紧日子。在这样的情况下，如果不顾客观条件，一味追求所谓排场、热闹，我认为不是明智之举。在40大庆时，我觉得在经济开支上尽量少花钱，体现勤俭精神。这也是我们党多年来一贯提倡的做法。
