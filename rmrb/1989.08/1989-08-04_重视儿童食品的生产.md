	Pay Attention to the Production of Children's Food

	According to statistics from relevant departments, there are currently around 200 children's food factories and workshops in China, with an annual production capacity of about 10,000 tons. Due to rising raw material prices and complex processing techniques, many food factories are barely profitable, and some are even operating at a loss. China has approximately 20 million infants born each year, of which one-third rely on formula milk. However, weaning foods can only meet the needs of 10% of newborns. Some parents, lacking necessary nutritional knowledge, blindly feed their children so-called "nutritional supplements," resulting in poor feeding and stunted growth in some children.

	It is suggested that relevant departments pay attention to the production of children's food, include it as a key focus in the development of the food industry, and strengthen the production and supply of children's food and nutritional products. Additionally, efforts should be made to popularize knowledge about infant and toddler feeding and child-rearing to provide the necessary knowledge for children's healthy growth.

    重视儿童食品的生产
    据有关部门统计：目前我国儿童食品厂、车间总共有二百来个，年产能力约一万吨。由于原料涨价，加工工艺复杂，不少食品厂获利甚微，有的甚至出现亏损。我国每年约有二千万个婴儿出生，其中的三分之一靠代乳品哺喂，但断奶食品仅能满足百分之十的新生儿。一些家长因缺乏必要的营养知识，盲目地给孩子服用所谓的“补品”，致使一些孩子喂养不好，生长发育不良。
    建议有关部门重视儿童食品生产，将其列入食品工业发展的重点；同时要加强儿童食品及营养品的生产与供应，做好婴幼儿喂养及育儿的科普宣传工作，为儿童健康成长提供知识。
