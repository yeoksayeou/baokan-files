Title: The Woman by the Sea

When a man goes out to sea,
the woman brews the sea into her eyes,
fermenting it into longing.
Her seaweed-like long hair dances in the wind,
beating out flocks of seagulls.
With the teeth of coral reefs,
she chews up the sound of the waves
to feed her children,
to sing them an ancient lullaby.
Night after night, the moon is bright, the tide rises in the lonely skylight.
The rhythmic anticipation follows the eaves towards the starry sky.
The clouds rising from the masthead
always carry a portion of emotional rain.
The woman by the sea
has her toes rotted by the salty parting,
then raises her beautiful arms to wave blessings.
Half of her has already turned into rocks on the shore
that can never be moved.
The other half is like scattered black pearls
strung along the endless landscape.

    海边的女人
    达黄
    男人一出海
    女人就把水酿在眼里
    发酵成思念
    海藻般的长发随风飘起
    拍打出阵阵鸥群
    以珊瑚丛的牙齿
    把波涛声嚼碎
    喂给孩子
    喂给摇篮古老的谣曲
    夜夜明月　潮涨在寂寞天窗
    韵味的期盼沿屋檐翘向星空
    桅杆上升起的云
    总含着一份动情的雨量
    海边的女人
    被咸涩的离别沤烂脚趾
    便举起美丽的臂膀挥舞祝福
    有一半已化为海岸上
    永远不能搬走的岩石
    另一半却如散落的黑珍珠
    缀在绵长的风景线上
