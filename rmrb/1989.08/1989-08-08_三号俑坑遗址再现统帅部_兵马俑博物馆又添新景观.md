The protective hall of the third pit of the Terracotta Warriors, which is the command headquarters of the three armies, will officially open to the public before the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The third pit of the Terracotta Warriors was discovered after the first and second pits. It is 28.8 meters long from east to west and 24.57 meters wide from north to south, with a distance of 25 meters and 120 meters from the first and second pits respectively, forming a concave shape. Based on long-term investigation, trial excavation, and research, the formal excavation and cleaning of the third pit began in December last year. Although the third pit is relatively small in area, its structure is unique and its status is very important. It is the command headquarters (military tent) of the Terracotta Warriors' three armies. Archaeological experts have made the following comparisons between the third pit and the first and second pits: the warrior terracotta figures in the first and second pits are basically facing east, arranged in battle formations, while the warrior terracotta figures in the third pit are arranged around the inner walls facing each other, forming a guard formation; the weapons unearthed from the first and second pits include crossbows, spears, halberds, axes, and swords, while the main weapons unearthed from the third pit are ceremonial weapons called "shu"; the wooden war chariots unearthed from the first and second pits are of general structure, without colorful paintings or canopies, while the four-horse chariots unearthed from the third pit are painted with lacquer and have canopies, and the riders wear single-rolled long hats, indicating a higher rank; the architectural layout of the third pit is also different from that of the first and second pits. It is divided into south and north halls and a chariot room. The west part of the north hall is the main hall, where deer antlers and animal bones were found, possibly used for feasting or sacrificial rituals before battle; multiple copper and iron rings were found on several door lintels in the pit, indicating that curtains were hung at the door, which verifies the ancient saying "running strategies in the tent."

Strangely, no high-ranking general terracotta figures were found in the third pit. Experts have made the following inferences based on on-site investigations and historical records: first, there is a large tomb in the north of the third pit, known as the "General's Tomb," and the general might be buried there; second, when Xiang Yu entered the pass, he destroyed the tomb, targeting the military tent and the commander, resulting in severe looting and destruction, making it impossible to find the general terracotta figure; third, Qin Shi Huang was the supreme commander and did not need to be commanded by others; fourth, during the Qin and Han dynasties, it was fashionable for the emperor to temporarily appoint generals to lead campaigns, and the commanding general was awaiting appointment by Qin Shi Huang, hence the temporary shortage.

    三号俑坑遗址再现统帅部  兵马俑博物馆又添新景观
    本报西安8月7日电　记者孟西安报道：秦陵兵马俑三军指挥部所在地——三号秦俑坑遗址保护厅，将在国庆40周年前夕正式开放。
    3号兵马俑坑是继1、2号俑坑之后发现的。它东西长28.8米，南北宽24.57米，与1、2号坑分别相距25米和120米，呈凹字形。在长期探查、试掘和研究的基础上，从去年12月正式开始全面发掘清理。3号坑虽然面积较小，但形制特殊，地位十分重要，是统帅兵马俑三军的指挥部（军幕）。考古专家把3号坑与1、2号坑做了如下对比：1、2号坑内的武士俑基本上都是面向东方，呈战斗队形编组，而3号坑内的武士俑是环绕周壁面内相向排列，呈警卫队行列；1、2号坑出土的武器有弓弩、矛、戈、钺、剑等，而3号坑出土的主要是仪卫武器“殳”；1、2号坑出土的木制战车形制一般，无彩绘、华盖，而3号坑出土的驷马战车用髹漆彩绘，车上建华盖，乘车人戴单卷尾长冠，人车级别较高；3号坑的建筑布局与1、2号坑也不同，它分南、北厢房和车马房，北厢房西部为正厅，正厅内发现鹿角及动物朽骨，似为军幕内宴饮或祭祀祷战之所；坑内几处门楣发现多枚铜铁环，昭示门前悬挂幕帘，古语“运筹于帷幄之中”的“帷幄”在此得到了印证。
    奇怪的是，3号俑坑中竟没有发现统帅三军的高级将领陶俑。专家们依据实地考察和文史资料，做出了以下几种推断：一、3号坑北部有一大墓，人称“将军墓”，可能“将军”掩埋在那里；二、项羽入关，在毁陵时，把军幕和统帅当成主攻目标，掠劫毁坏惨重，将军俑无法寻觅；三、秦始皇应是最高统帅，无需他人指挥；四、秦汉之际，时兴皇帝临时命将出征，指挥将领正待秦始皇任命，故暂短缺。
