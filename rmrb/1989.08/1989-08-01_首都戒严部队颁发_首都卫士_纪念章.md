Capital martial law troops held a ceremony to award "Capital Guard" commemorative badges this morning on Tiananmen Square. The soldiers on duty at the square, wearing the shiny "Capital Guard" badges, appeared even more dignified and imposing.

More than 1,000 troops stood in formation facing the national flag flying high above the square. After the military band played the national anthem, Zhang Meiyuan, the major general and commander of the martial law troops, and Wang Fuyi, the major general and political commissar, awarded the badges to the troops. Following this, more than a thousand troops raised their hands and took an oath: "Loyal to the Party, loyal to the country, loyal to the people, love the capital, resolutely carry the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion to the end, and be faithful 'Capital Guards.'"

It is understood that the "Capital Guard" commemorative badges will be awarded to the capital martial law troops in the coming days.
