The three working committees of the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue held two meetings today, discussing procedural matters and making initial progress.

The ministerial-level meeting of the international conference concluded at 4 PM on August 1, deciding to establish three working committees and one special committee to discuss important issues related to the comprehensive political resolution of the Cambodian problem.

On August 2, the three working committees held their first meetings, announcing the establishment of the committees and determining the meeting rules. Today, during the second and third meetings, rapporteurs for each committee were elected. They are responsible for compiling meeting minutes, drafting and revising documents, and other textual work. The election results are as follows: the rapporteur for the first committee is from the Philippines, the second committee—France, and the third committee—Thailand. The first working committee is tasked with establishing an international supervisory body to monitor the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, drafting ceasefire terms and implementation plans, and so on. The second committee is responsible for defining the obligations of international guarantees: ensuring Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and neutrality, and guaranteeing the cessation of foreign interference and military aid, among other things. The third committee plans for the voluntary repatriation of Cambodian refugees and prepares international aid plans for the reconstruction of Cambodia.

The three committees also discussed meeting procedures, including the drafting of working documents, and made initial progress.

The special committee held its first meeting this afternoon, determining that the rapporteurs for this committee will be France and Indonesia, who are also the co-chairs of the international conference and this committee.

It is reported that the meetings of the four committees were conducted in a good atmosphere. As the discussions deepen, the committees will encounter many substantive issues and obstacles. However, as long as the relevant parties adhere to the spirit of the conference, which advocates for a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable resolution to the Cambodian issue, and work sincerely towards reconciliation, the committees' work will achieve substantial progress.
