Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 17th. People's Daily reporter Zhang Shusheng and Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Huiming report: State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian said at the opening of the fourth national Star Program work conference yesterday that some basic policies of China's science and technology system reform must be firmly upheld and continuously improved in practice.

Song Jian gave full recognition to the various privately-run scientific research institutions that have emerged during the reform and opening up. He said that the development of privately-run scientific research institutions is an important supplement to scientific work entering the economic sphere. The basic policy towards these privately-run scientific research institutions should not be changed, and what is needed in the future is to strengthen macro-management and guidance.

Song Jian said in his speech that in terms of persisting with science and technology reform policies, the following issues should be primarily addressed at present:

	•	Units implementing the contract responsibility system should seriously study how to better leverage the advantages of scientific and technological groups and promote the spirit of collectivism. The various policies and measures for deepening the reform should help to form group advantages rather than weaken them.

	•	The policy of activating scientific and technological personnel and encouraging the rational flow of talent should be improved. On the one hand, talent that has been accumulated should be released to society, and on the other hand, national and collective interests should not be harmed.

	•	Companies engaged in scientific and technological development, technology transfer, and scientific and technological consulting services should take promoting economic development through science and technology as their fundamental purpose and should not engage in commercial wholesale activities unrelated to their own business.

	•	Continue to adhere to opening up to the outside world. While strengthening international scientific and technological cooperation, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political work, establish standardized organizational systems, continuously improve the vigilance of scientific and technological personnel, and prevent the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization trends.

    宋健在全国星火计划会议上强调
    坚持并完善科技体制改革政策
    当前要解决好发挥群体优势等四方面问题
    本报兰州8月17日电　本报记者张述圣、新华社记者陈惠明报道：国务委员、国家科委主任宋健在昨天开幕的第四次全国星火计划工作会议上说，我国科技体制改革的一些基本政策，都要毫不动摇地坚持下去，并在实践中不断加以完善。
    宋健对改革开放中涌现的各类民办科研机构给予充分肯定。他说，民办科研机构的发展，是对科技工作进入经济领域的重要补充，对这类民办科研机构的基本政策不应改变，今后需要的是加强宏观管理和指导。
    宋健在讲话中说，在坚持科技改革政策方面，当前主要应抓好以下几个问题：
    ——实行承包责任制的单位，要认真研究如何更好地发挥科技群体优势，发扬集体主义精神。深化改革的各项政策措施，应该有助于形成群体优势，而不是削弱它。
    ——要完善放活科技人员和鼓励人才合理流动的政策，一方面要向社会释放被积压的人才，另一方面又不能损害国家利益和集体利益。
    ——从事科技开发、技术转让、科技咨询服务的公司，应以科学技术促进经济发展为根本宗旨，一律不得从事与自身业务无关的商业批发经营活动。
    ——继续坚持对外开放，在加强国际科技合作的同时，要切实加强思想政治工作，建立规范化的组织制度，不断提高科技人员的警惕性，防止资产阶级自由化思潮的侵入。
