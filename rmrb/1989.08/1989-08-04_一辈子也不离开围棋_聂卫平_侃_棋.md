On the evening of July 29, a crucial match between China and Thailand was held in Shenyang, determining whether the Chinese football team could advance to the next round. The match attracted widespread attention, and few sports enthusiasts would miss the opportunity to watch the live broadcast.

However, at that very moment, the auditorium in the Changchun Hotel, which can accommodate over 1,000 spectators, was packed. China's national Go team head coach and "Go Saint" Nie Weiping was giving a lecture on Go to the Go enthusiasts in Changchun, frequently earning rounds of applause.

To inspect the preparations for the "New Sports Cup" Go tournament scheduled to be held in Changchun in mid-August, Nie Weiping, at the invitation of the Jilin Provincial Sports Commission and the Changchun Chaoyang District Chess Equipment Factory, came to this city.

The next morning, the reporter interviewed Nie Weiping at the hotel, listening to Nie Weiping's insights on Go.

On September 1, the "Apsang Cup" World Professional Go Championship final between Nie Weiping and South Korea's Cho Hunhyun will take place in Singapore. Nie Weiping is currently leading with a 2-1 score. If he wins the next match, he will secure the title of this highest-level Go competition. If he loses, the two will have to decide the winner in the fifth match. Regarding this, he candidly said, "I really want to win this match." He explained that in the past, some people, both domestically and internationally, thought Cho Hunhyun was just a Go player known for his aggressive style, which was not a comprehensive view. Nie Weiping introduced that Cho Hunhyun has a unique playing style, a strong overall concept, and balanced board control, making him a very strong player with deep skills.

Then, Nie Weiping shared an incident. In the first match against Cho Hunhyun, he wanted to "test" his opponent and made a soft move in the opening, leading to his defeat.

When talking about the recent China-Japan Go tournament, Nie Weiping happily said, "Our first player, Yang Shihai, a three-dan player, defeated Iida Kiki. It's very impressive." He expressed his hope for this tournament, saying, "I am full of hope."

Nie Weiping revealed that the State Sports Commission recently adjusted and formulated a new Olympic strategy, and Go was not included in the key projects. He expressed his concern that Go might decline.

Nie Weiping hopes that young players can grow quickly and "defeat people like me." He said that if he can no longer play due to physical reasons in the future, he will continue to be a coach and provide guidance, "never leaving Go for a lifetime."

    一辈子也不离开围棋
    ——聂卫平“侃”棋
    7月29日晚，关系到中国足球队能否小组出线的中、泰之战在沈阳举行。其吸引力非同一般，有哪个体育迷肯错过观看电视转播的机会呢？
    然而此时此刻，长春市宾馆能容纳1000多名观众的礼堂却座无虚席。中国围棋队总教练、“棋圣”聂卫平正在为长春市的棋迷们讲棋，不时博得阵阵掌声。
    为了考查8月中下旬将在长春举行的“新体育杯”围棋赛的准备情况，聂卫平应吉林省体委和长春市朝阳区棋具总厂的邀请来到此地。
    翌日上午，记者在宾馆采访了聂卫平，听聂卫平“侃”棋经。
    今年9月1日，由台湾应昌期先生出资举办的“应氏杯”世界职业围棋锦标赛冠军之争，聂卫平同南朝鲜曹薰铉的第4盘比赛将在新加坡进行。聂卫平目前是2胜1负，若再下一城，就将夺得这个代表世界围棋最高水平比赛的桂冠。如输给对手，聂、曹2人将在第5盘比赛中分出高低。对此，他毫不隐瞒地说：“这场比赛，我还是非常想赢的。”他解释说，过去国内外一些人认为曹薰铉不过是以力量型见长的围棋选手，这种看法不够全面。聂卫平介绍说，曹薰铉行棋风格独特，全局观念强，布棋均衡，是一个“内功”很强的高手。
    接着老聂介绍了一件事，在对曹薰铉的第一盘比赛中，他想“考验”一下对手，结果在布局阶段走了一步软着，导致失利。
    在谈到今年中日围棋擂台赛时，聂卫平高兴地说，我方先锋杨士海三段战胜依田纪基，“很了不起”。对于这届中日擂台赛，“我充满希望”。
    聂卫平透露，国家体委最近重新调整制定了新的奥运战略，围棋没有被列入重点项目之内。他对围棋可能会走下坡路表示担忧。
    聂卫平希望年轻选手尽快成长，“打败像我这样的人”。他表示，以后一旦由于身体原因不能下棋了就继续当教练，做指导，“一辈子也不离开围棋”。
