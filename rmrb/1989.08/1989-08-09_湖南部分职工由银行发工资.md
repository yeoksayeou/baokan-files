By the end of June, 3,466 government agencies, organizations, and enterprises in Hunan Province had opened "salary deposit" accounts with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and 420,000 staff and workers received their salaries directly from the bank.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Hunan Province began promoting this service this year. Units participating in the "salary deposit" scheme only need to issue a payroll and a check, and the salaries can be directly transferred to each employee's designated account. Employees can then withdraw their salaries from the bank at any time.

By the end of June, the savings balance from this service alone at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Hunan Province had reached 330 million yuan, with 10% to 20% of the salaries being deposited as savings.
