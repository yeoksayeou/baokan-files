She gently pushed open the door of the gray little building, and a warm gust of air greeted her, momentarily making her forget the biting cold wind outside. A warm current surged through her heart.

This was her home, and also the home of retired teachers in Shanghai's Jing'an District. Bright sunlight streamed through the clean windows, illuminating the faces of the elderly teachers, making them look younger. The tabletop stereo played lively, passionate music, and a group of elderly teachers, with silver streaks in their hair, danced enthusiastically to the rhythm of the old-year disco. The retired physical education teacher, acting as the coach, demonstrated movements while shouting, "Look! Just like that, it's easy. Forget that you're a principal, forget that you're a grandmother, or a great-grandmother. Just like when you're pushing through a crowded train." In the next room, soft melodies of "Serenade" played, and a few elderly teachers were deeply engrossed in painting. Soon, white sheets of paper were adorned with vibrant peonies, green pines, and lifelike white cranes. The potted plants scattered around, emitting a faint fragrance, were originally an exhibition of the Horticulture Group's achievements, temporarily serving as still-life subjects for the Art Group. The numerous excellent photographs on the wall were a report of the Photography Group's achievements, with many of the works having been selected to participate in photography competitions and winning several excellent photography awards. These elderly teachers had spent their lives toiling in the schoolyard, so busy that they had no time to dress themselves up. Now that they are retired, they have time to wear the fashionable old-age clothing designed by the Clothing Group, which is both stylish and elegant, making them even more full of vitality.

Those retired teachers who are in good health can continue to contribute to the sacred cause of education. Whenever a school urgently needs a substitute teacher, or a family wants a private tutor, they come here for help. The "Retired Teachers' Home" often accepts commissions from various units to organize various training classes. They specially established a part-time supplementary school for young workers; an after-school tutoring class for primary school students who have no one to take care of them after school and wear keys around their necks; and a college entrance examination supplementary class for graduating students preparing for the college entrance examination. These elderly teachers have rich teaching experience and teach with patience and effort, so the college entrance examination supplementary class has a high admission rate.

Each of them has experienced the hardships of the "Cultural Revolution." Some lost their health in this unprecedented disaster, and some lost their loved ones in the "catastrophe." The "Retired Teachers' Home" often sends people to visit and comfort them. During festivals and holidays, everyone gathers together, has a reunion meal, and each person makes a dish they are good at, creating a lively and joyful atmosphere. Those retired elderly teachers without children by their side say, "With this 'home,' I no longer feel lonely!" "We have not been forgotten!"

When the oldest teacher turned 80, everyone worked together to make a sweet, extra-large birthday cake for the old birthday star and held a grand celebration banquet. Everything was ready, and a small car was borrowed to bring the old birthday star here. The room was filled with the aroma of food, and the song "Happy Birthday to You" rang out. The old teacher, tears in her eyes, said, "I've lived my life, and this is the first time I've had such a grand birthday celebration!"

    他们没有被遗忘
    萧阳
    她轻轻地推开那幢灰色小楼的大门，一股热烘烘的气息迎面扑来，使她顷刻之间忘却了外面凛冽的寒风，心里涌上一股暖流。
    这里是她的家，也是上海静安区退休教师共同的家。明媚的阳光透过洁净的玻璃窗照在老教师们的脸上，使这些两鬓染霜的老人们显得年轻了。桌上的录音机播放着欢快热烈的乐曲，一群老教师随着音乐的节拍满怀激情地跳着老年迪斯科。担任教练的退休体育老师一面做着示范动作，一面喊着：“看！就这样，很容易的，忘了你是校长，忘了你是奶奶，你是姥姥，就像挤电车上车时候的动作那样……”旁边那间屋里播放着幽雅的《小夜曲》，几位老教师正聚精会神地埋首描绘丹青。一会儿，一张张雪白的宣纸上便出现了鲜艳的牡丹花，苍绿的松树，栩栩如生的白鹤。……那一盆盆散放着幽香的花卉盆景，原是花卉组的成绩展览，临时充当了美术组写生的教具。那琳琅满目的满墙摄影佳作，是摄影组的成绩汇报，其中不少作品曾经被选送参加摄影比赛，获得了好几项优秀摄影作品奖呢。这些老教师们一辈子在校园里辛苦耕耘，忙得顾不上打扮自己。现在退休了，有时间了，穿上服装组设计的老年时装，款式新颖，美观大方，还挺“新潮”呢，越发使他们充满了活力。
    那些身体健康的退休教师，还能继续为神圣的教育事业发挥“余热”。哪所学校急需代课教师，谁家想请家庭教师，都到这儿来求援。“退休教工之家”还经常接受各个单位的委托，代办各种培训班。他们特地为青年工人办了一所业余补习学校；为放学后家中无人照料、脖子上挂钥匙的小学生办了课余辅导班；还为准备参加高考的毕业生办了高考补习班。那些老教师有丰富的教学经验，又教得耐心尽力，所以高考补习班升学率很高。
    他们中间的每一个人，都经历过“文化大革命”的苦难岁月。有的人在这场史无前例的灾难中丧失了健康，有的人在“浩劫”中失去了亲人。“退休教工之家”经常派人去探望、慰问。逢年过节，大家聚在一起，吃一顿团圆饭，每个人做一个最拿手的菜，热热闹闹，欢欢喜喜。那些身边无子女的退休老教师说：“有了这个‘家’，我不再感到孤寂了！”“我们没有被遗忘！”
    年岁最长的老教师做80岁生日的时候，大家一齐动手为老寿星做了一个香甜的特号大蛋糕，举办了丰盛的庆祝宴会。一切准备就绪，借一辆小汽车把老寿星接来。屋子里飘着浓郁的食物的香味，响起
  “祝你生日快乐！”的歌声。老教师含着热泪说：“活了一辈子，还是第一次这样隆重地过生日呢！”
