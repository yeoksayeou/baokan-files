In Wuliqing, Jinhua City, Zhang Hongbin and Lou Xiaoying, a couple living in a dilapidated temple, have, over the past 16 years, raised more than 20 abandoned infants by earning money from collecting scrap. With the help of various sectors of society, the two elderly people and the five children currently with them have finally obtained household registration, ending their days without official identity.

While reflecting on this, one cannot help but think of other issues. According to the author's investigation, in some places, especially in rural areas, there are many children without land or household registration, and people refer to them as "black children." The reasons for the emergence of "black children" are numerous, with one important reason being that some people, in order to evade family planning, intentionally conceal and do not report. Regardless of the reasons, one thing is clear: in rural areas, not only is there a large number of overpopulation cases, but many of these cases are not included in official statistics. It is difficult to say exactly how many people are not registered. These people are still young and do not seem to pose a significant burden on society, but in a few years, when these people suddenly appear, demanding food, shelter, and employment, potential conflicts will emerge. Therefore, not only should the overpopulation problem be addressed, but special attention should also be given to the "black children" phenomenon, which does not even have a clear count.

Some places have already come up with some countermeasures for this phenomenon, but many places still adopt a "wait and see" attitude, turning a blind eye. This is very detrimental.

The population problem has become an urgent issue. If not properly addressed, it will not only hinder construction but may also become a malignant factor that obstructs the long-term stability and prosperity of the country. Therefore, the author believes that, first, we must face the contradictions and reality. The existence of so many "black children" is a fact. Ignoring it will not make the contradictions disappear; instead, they will become more acute. It is better to conduct a census to see how many such people there are and to have a clear understanding. The "black children" phenomenon is abnormal, but it is an objective reality. They should also grow up healthily like other children. On the other hand, work should be done in advance, not just when a child is born. The key is to find effective countermeasures and ensure their implementation to reverse the out-of-control population situation. Second, our long-term family planning work has achieved results, and many people have made extremely arduous efforts for this, which should be affirmed. However, it should also be noted that in some places, family planning work has not been thoroughly implemented, seemingly reducing the issue to setting a fine amount each year and filling out a population report, resulting in mothers with five or six children being common in some rural areas. This situation should also be changed. Family planning work is difficult and requires exploration; even if some good methods are found, there is still considerable resistance to their implementation. This requires us to do more arduous and detailed work, and to grasp it tightly. Currently, in addition to strengthening propaganda, strict and practical measures should also be taken to ensure that the work is solid and effective.

    令人忧虑的“黑孩”现象
    金海
    金华市五里亭，住在破庙里的张洪斌、楼小英夫妇，16年来靠捡破烂的钱，收养了20多个弃婴。两位老人及现在身边的5个孩子，经社会多方帮助，终于领到了户口簿，结束了没有户籍的日子。
    感慨之余，也生出一些想法。据笔者调查，在一些地方尤其是农村，没有土地、没有户口的孩子是不少的，人们称他们是“黑孩”。“黑孩”现象的出现，原因很多，其中一个重要的原因是有些人为了逃避计划生育，故意隐瞒不报。不管基于什么原因，但有一点是清楚的，这就是农村不仅存在着大量的超生现象，而且不少是无法以数目字统计的。究竟有多少不在册的人口，实在说不清。这些人现在年龄尚小，似乎还没有对社会构成太大的压力，但过不了几年，这些人忽然冒出来，要吃，要住，要就业，潜在的矛盾就会凸现出来。因此，不仅要重视超生问题，而且要特别重视连个底数都没有的“黑孩”现象。
    对这种现象，有的地方已经想了些对策，但是更多的地方仍然抱着“走着瞧”的态度，睁一只眼，闭一只眼。这是很不利的。
    人口问题已经成为一个迫在眉睫的大问题，解决不好，不光要拖建设的后腿，而且很可能成为妨碍国家长治久安的一个恶性因素。因此，笔者认为，第一，要正视矛盾，面对现实。“黑孩”这么多，是事实，不予理会，矛盾仍然存在，而且会越来越尖锐。不如来一次普查，看看这样的人口有多少，尽可能做到心中有数。“黑孩”现象是不正常的，但又是客观存在。他们也应该和其他孩子一样健康成长。另一方面，要把工作做到前面，不要等到人呱呱落地才着急。重要的是，要寻找有效的对策，并使其真正得到落实，扭转人口失控的局面。第二，我们多年来所进行的计划生育工作是有成绩的，不少人为此付出了极为艰苦的努力，这一点应该肯定。但同时也应看到，确有一些地方，计划生育工作始终没有深入下去，似乎每年定个罚款数目，再作个人口报表就完事大吉，以致五六个孩子的母亲在有些农村比比皆是。这种状况也应改变。计划生育工作难度很大，还要摸索；即使有了些好办法，落实下去也还有相当的阻力。这就需要我们作更加艰苦、细致的工作，抓得很紧很紧。现在看来，除了大力抓好宣传以外，还要采取严格而切实的措施，做得扎扎实实。
