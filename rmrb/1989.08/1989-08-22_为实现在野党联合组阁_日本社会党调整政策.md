People's Daily, Tokyo, August 22nd. Correspondent Yu Qing reports: The Japanese Socialist Party, which saw a significant increase in its seats in the House of Councillors election, is adjusting its policies with the aim of dissolving the House of Representatives, winning the general election, and forming a united opposition cabinet.

The party has, for the first time, proposed new views on the continued existence of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Self-Defense Forces.

The Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting of its executives in Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture, yesterday. In his report on the basic policies for a united opposition government, Secretary-General Yamaguchi proposed the following new policy views:

1. Politically, prioritize freedom and democracy as the fundamental principles;
2. Economically, maintain a free market economy as the basic structure, avoiding extreme policies and changes;
3. In international economic relations, based on the reality of the Japan-U.S. axis, establish an equal, free, and mutually beneficial relationship;
4. Diplomatically, correct the bias towards the U.S., achieve autonomous diplomacy as a member of Asia, and adapt to a multipolar world with comprehensive diplomacy. Currently, maintain the continuity of diplomacy under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty;
5. Strictly adhere to the defense expenditure not exceeding 1% of the national gross product, and continue the existence of the Self-Defense Forces under civilian control.

Public opinion believes that the Socialist Party, in order to reduce the differences in basic policies with other opposition parties, is making efforts to coordinate the policies of the opposition parties to realize a united opposition cabinet. The party has made some adjustments to its long-standing policies.

    为实现在野党联合组阁
    日本社会党调整政策
    本报东京8月22日电　记者于青报道：在参院选举中议席大增的日本社会党，以解散众院、大选取胜后，与其他在野党联合组阁为目的，调整政策。
    该党首次提出日美安全条约和自卫队继续存在的新见解。
    日本社会党昨天在静冈县伊东市召开干部会议，山口书记长关于在野党联合政权基本政策的报告中，提出的政策新见解有：
    一、政治上以自由和民主为基本点；
    二、经济上以自由的市场经济为基本结构，不寻求过激的政策和变化；
    三、在国际经济方面，从日美基轴的现实出发，建立对等、自由、互惠的关系；
    四、外交上纠正对美偏重外交，实现作为亚洲一员的自主外交和适应多极化时代的全方位外交。当前，维持日美安全条约的外交连续性；
    五、严守防卫费不超过国民生产总值的1％，自卫队在文官控制下继续存在等。
    舆论认为，社会党是为了减少与其他在野党在基本政策上的反差，尽力协调在野党政策，实现在野党联合组阁，对该党的历来政策做了一些调整。
