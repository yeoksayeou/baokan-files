Question: Should personal income from participating in prize-saving activities and purchasing prize bonds be taxed, and how should the tax be paid?

Answer: Currently, the People's Bank of China and various specialized banks, as well as postal departments at all levels, have widely implemented various prize-saving activities. Prize-saving, as a means for state banks and postal departments to attract deposits, has played a certain positive role in concentrating social idle funds and making up for the shortage of production and construction funds. However, due to the inherent characteristics of prize-saving, it is inevitable that a small number of people will obtain excessively high income by winning high prizes. This results in a significant disparity in income among society members, exacerbating the situation of unfair income distribution. To mitigate the adverse effects caused by prize-saving, after discussions with the People's Bank of China, the People's Bank of China Headquarters issued the "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Prize-Saving Activities" (银发〔1987〕362号文) on November 13, 1987. This notice regulated the prize-winning rate and the maximum prize amount, which to some extent, alleviated the situation of unfair income distribution caused by narrow prize-winning rates and high prize amounts. In light of this, the State Taxation Administration, after extensively seeking opinions from various relevant parties, also made corresponding decisions. It was decided that personal income from participating in prize-saving activities organized by state banks and postal departments would not be subject to personal income adjustment tax for the time being.

However, for personal income obtained from participating in prize-saving and prize bond activities organized by various enterprises and institutions through banks, taxes should be paid according to the relevant regulations of the State Taxation Administration. That is, the prize income amount should be subject to a 20% proportional tax rate for calculation and payment; the tax should be withheld and paid by the organizing unit. If the organizing unit does not withhold the tax as required, and the winner does not voluntarily report and pay taxes to the local tax authorities, they should be penalized according to the relevant provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on the Administration of Tax Collection of the People's Republic of China."

    购买各种奖券中奖后要不要纳税？
    问：个人参加有奖储蓄和购买有奖债券取得的中奖收入应否征税，如何纳税？

    答：目前，中国人民银行和各专业银行以及各级邮政部门普遍开展了各类有奖储蓄活动。有奖储蓄作为国家银行和邮政部门吸收存款的一种手段，在集中社会闲散资金，弥补生产建设资金的不足方面，发挥了一定的积极作用。但是，由于有奖储蓄自身的特点，它不可避免地会出现极少数人因中高奖而取得过高的收入。致使社会成员间收入过份悬殊，加剧了收入分配不公的状况。为了尽可能消除有奖储蓄所引起的不利影响，经我局与中国人民银行商谈，中国人民银行总行于1987年11月13日以银发〔1987〕362号文发出了《关于加强有奖储蓄管理工作的通知》，对中奖面以及中奖最高奖额作了规定，这在一定程度上，缓解了因中奖面过窄和奖额过高所造成的收入分配不公状况。有鉴于此，国家税务局在广泛征求各有关方面意见的基础上也作出相应决定，对个人因参加国家银行和邮政部门举办的有奖储蓄活动所取得的中奖收入暂不征收个人收入调节税。
    但是，对于个人因参加各企事业单位通过银行举办的有奖集资、有奖债券活动所取得的中奖收入，应按照国家税务局有关文件的规定，缴纳个人收入调节税。即就其中奖收入金额，适用20％的比例税率计算缴纳；税款一律由主办单位代扣代缴。如主办单位不按规定代扣税款，中奖者也不主动到当地税务机关申报纳税的，应按《中华人民共和国税收征收管理暂行条例》的有关规定给予惩处。
