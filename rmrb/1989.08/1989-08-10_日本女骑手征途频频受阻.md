Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 9th —

A report from Ruoqiang: Due to an unprecedented major flood along the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, the Japanese Women's Motorcycle Friendship Tour, which is crossing the Chinese mainland, has been frequently delayed, and their schedule has been repeatedly postponed.

Since this summer, the Kunlun Mountains have received abundant rainfall. The torrential mountain floods have flowed into the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, washing away large sections of the highway. In some areas, the water depth on the road surface exceeds one meter, causing many problems for the tour group. Since August 4th, when the group left Hotan, the motorcyclists have encountered repeated obstacles. They have had to take detours to get out of trouble. The girls are complaining. On the 7th, the tour group set out from Qiemo towards Ruoqiang. Along the way, a support vehicle carrying supplies got stuck in a mud pit. Today, although six female riders finally safely reached the small town of Ruoqiang on the southeastern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, the stranded vehicle is still being rescued.

Thus, the tour group's schedule will be delayed by at least two days.

The tour group, which departed from Beijing on June 28th, left Urumqi on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains on July 26th and headed south into the desert.

    日本女骑手征途频频受阻
    新华社乌鲁木齐8月9日电　（记者姜志武）若羌消息：由于塔克拉玛干大沙漠南缘出现了几十年来罕见的特大洪水，使正在进行跨越中国大陆远征的日本女子摩托车友好旅行团频频受阻，行期一再延误。
    今年夏季以来，昆仑山脉降水充沛；滚滚的山洪汇入塔克拉玛干沙漠南缘，冲毁了大段大段的公路，有些地段的路面上积水深达1米以上，这给旅行团带来了许多麻烦。旅行团自8月4日离开和田以后，摩托车骑手接连受阻，她们只有靠绕道行进，以摆脱困境。姑娘们叫苦不迭。7日，旅行团从且末向若羌进发，途中，一辆运载给养的辅助车不慎陷入泥坑中。今天，虽然6名女骑手终于安全抵达了塔克拉玛干沙漠东南缘的小城——若羌，但抛锚的车辆依然处于营救之中。
    这样，旅行团的行期至少要延误两天。
    6月28日由北京启程的这个旅行团，是7月26日告别天山北麓的乌鲁木齐，南进大沙漠的。
