Title: Africa Once Had an "Amazon River"

According to satellite-detected intelligence, a long time ago, there was a river comparable in size to the Amazon River in South America that flowed across the entire African continent. This river originated from the Red Sea, passed through the current locations of the Nile River and the Sahara region, and finally flowed into the Atlantic Ocean. It was over 4,500 kilometers long. Since satellites can detect up to 2 meters below the Earth's surface, the riverbed of this large river is clearly visible on satellite images. Additionally, the exposed riverbeds in the regions where Egypt, Libya, and Sudan meet provide further evidence.

Geologists have determined that this river existed approximately 2 million years ago. Later, due to geological changes, this river disappeared, resulting in the formation of the Nile River. Geologists believe that the water of the Nile River is part of the same water system as the ancient "Amazon River," but its mouth is no longer the Atlantic Ocean but the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the lowering of the water levels in Lake Victoria and Lake Chad, the Sahara region eventually turned into a desert.

    非洲曾有“亚马逊河”
    根据卫星探测到的情报，在很久以前有一条和巴西亚马逊河差不多大小的河曾流经整个非洲大陆。这条河起源于红海，经过现在的尼罗河、撒哈拉地区，最后流入大西洋。全长4500多公里。由于卫星能探测到地球表面2米深处，所以这条大河的河床位置在卫星照片上清晰可见。同时，埃及、利比亚和苏丹交接地区暴露在外的河床也可作佐证。
    经地质学家们鉴定，这条大河大约存在于200万年以前。后来，由于地质变动，这条大河消失了，结果出现了尼罗河。地质学家们认为，尼罗河的水同古“亚马逊河”的水是同一水系，但它的入海口已不是大西洋，而是地中海。由于维多利亚湖和乍得湖水位降低，致使撒哈拉地区最终变成沙漠。（刘建明编译）
