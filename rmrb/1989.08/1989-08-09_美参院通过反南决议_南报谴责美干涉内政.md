Today, many newspapers in Yugoslavia published articles condemning a new resolution passed by the U.S. Senate on August 4 regarding human rights in Yugoslavia.

According to Yugoslav media reports, the U.S. Senate's anti-Yugoslav resolution openly supports the efforts of Yugoslav émigré Milorad Praljak, who is supposedly working to strengthen the protection of human rights in Yugoslavia. Praljak was sentenced in Zagreb in 1980 for engaging in hostile activities. After his release from prison in 1986, he filed a lawsuit through the court seeking compensation for "physical and mental suffering." The U.S. Senate resolution arbitrarily affirmed that the Zagreb court did not take "honest" and "fair" legal proceedings in rejecting this lawsuit, using it as an excuse to condemn the Yugoslav government. The resolution also mentioned another Yugoslav citizen, Jewish university student E. Burnas, who was arrested along with Praljak for signing a petition "opposing torture and interrogation in Yugoslavia and demanding the release of political prisoners." Burnas died "mysteriously" three days after his arrest. The resolution finally demands that the Yugoslav government ensure the most basic rights and freedoms for its citizens, unconditionally grant amnesty to all political prisoners, drop all recent charges against human rights "activist" Praljak, and investigate and publicize the cause of Burnas' death, among other things.

Yugoslav newspapers pointed out that the United States' actions will inevitably provoke dissatisfaction from the Yugoslav side and will certainly damage the relationship between the two countries.

    美参院通过反南决议  南报谴责美干涉内政
    本报贝尔格莱德8月9日电  记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫许多报纸发表文章，谴责美国参议院4日就所谓南斯拉夫的人权问题通过的新决议。
    据南新闻媒介报道，美参院的反南决议公开支持南侨民多·帕拉加所谓“为加强保护南斯拉夫的人权”所作的努力。帕拉加1980年因从事敌对活动在萨格勒布被判过刑，他出狱后于1986年通过法院提出要求赔偿“由于肉体上精神上遭受折磨所造成的损失”。美参院决议武断地肯定萨格勒布法院拒绝对此采取“诚实”和“公正”的诉讼程序，作为谴责南政府的借口。美参院决议还提到另一个南斯拉夫公民、犹太族大学生埃·布尔纳斯特由于在请愿书中“反对南斯拉夫的拷打审讯，要求释放政治犯”，也与帕拉加一起被捕，并在被捕后3天“神秘地死去”。决议最后竟要求南政府确保本国公民最基本的权利和自由，无条件宣布大赦一切政治犯；取消所有对争取人权的“积极分子”帕拉加的最新指控，调查布尔纳斯特死因并公布于众等等。
    南斯拉夫报纸指出，美国这样做必然会遭到南斯拉夫方面的不满，当然也会损害南美两国的关系。
