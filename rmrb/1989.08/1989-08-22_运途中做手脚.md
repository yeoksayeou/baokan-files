On the northern outskirts of Changzhi City, along the Changxin Road, some individual transport operators have taken advantage of transporting cement for a certain coal mine to embezzle a significant amount of goods. They unload the cement midway on the road, open the bags, remove some of the cement, reseal the bags, and then deliver them to the receiving unit. The remaining cement is sold to others. The receiving unit does not weigh the goods and accepts them as is. Initially, only a few people engaged in such activities, but now nearly a hundred people are doing the same. Recently, along this 200-meter stretch of Changxin Road, many individual transport operators' cement-laden tractors have passed through, leaving a layer of cement on the road surface.

    运途中做手脚
    在长治市北郊长辛路段，一些个体运输户，利用给某煤矿运水泥之机，大揩油水。他们将水泥中途卸在路上，拆袋倒出一些，重新封袋后，交给收货单位。留下的就卖给他人。而收货单位从不过秤，照收不误。开始时，只有几个人做这样的手脚，现在发展到近百人这样干了。近来，就在这二百米左右的长辛路段上，许多个体户运水泥的拖拉机驶过，路面上就留下一层水泥。
    上图：运水泥的拖拉机停在路上，挡住过路行人，好做手脚。
    下图：卸下车上的水泥，一袋扒一点，装入自备的袋子里。
