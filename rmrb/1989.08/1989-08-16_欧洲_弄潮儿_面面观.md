    A Look at Europe's Swimming Stars

    When Will Otto Bid Farewell to the Pool?

    East Germany, a country renowned for its swimming prowess, is represented by the 23-year-old Leipzig native, Kristin Otto. Her frequent visits to Bonn have piqued the interest of the audience. This six-time gold medalist from the Seoul Olympics is currently studying journalism while continuing to compete. From her recent performances, it is unclear whether she will soon retire from swimming. In mid-June, at the East German Championships in Magdeburg (also a selection event for the European Championships), she won the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 1:01.77 and the 200-meter backstroke with a time of 2:13.69. In Bonn, she still has a good chance of winning again. Otto aspires to be a journalist and has good communication skills. This spring, she conducted interviews at the Leipzig Trade Fair as an intern for the East German Broadcasting Station. When will she retire from the pool? Everyone is wondering.

    Where Has the "Albatross" Gone?

    This year's Bonn Championships have faced some financial difficulties, causing spectators to hesitate in purchasing tickets. The organizers secretly blame the famous "Albatross," Michael Groß, for not participating: if he were to compete, the tickets would have been sold out quickly. Where has the "Albatross" flown off to? In reality, he hasn't gone anywhere; he will still come to watch. However, since the Olympics last year, he has wanted to take a break and consider his future career. Currently, he is focusing on writing his thesis, titled "Schiller as a Politician." This time, he will write commentary for a newspaper and serve as a commentator for Channel 2. He too has dreamed of becoming a journalist.

    How Will the "Quintet" from the Danube Sound?

    Along the Danube, Hungary has a formidable "quintet" that cannot be underestimated. They are Darnay, Szabo, Gutler, Debnár, and Egerváry (female). Since 1985, Darnay has consistently led in the medley events, winning two Olympic gold medals, two World Championship gold medals, and four European Championship gold medals in the 200 and 400-meter medley events. Egerváry, who will turn 15 on August 16, has already won the gold medal in the 200-meter backstroke at the Olympics. Szabo, the former world and European champion, is the most promising candidate for the long-distance breaststroke, and people hope he will break the world record held by Canadian Victor Davis for five years.

    欧洲“弄潮儿”面面观
    奥托何时告别泳池
    民主德国——当今赫赫有名的游泳大国，其代表是23岁的莱比锡姑娘克里斯汀·奥托。她多次来到波恩，使观众大感兴趣。这个汉城奥运会6枚金牌得主，现在一边学新闻，一边参加比赛。从她这次参赛来看，她还没有最后决定是否很快结束泳池生涯。6月中旬，在民主德国马格德堡锦标赛（也是欧洲锦标赛选拔赛）上她获100米仰泳冠军，成绩1分1秒77，200米仰游也是冠军，成绩2分13秒69，在波恩她仍大有希望再次夺冠。奥托想当记者，因此交际能力不错。今年春天她在莱比锡博览会上已经以民德广播电台实习生身份四处采访了。她何时告别泳池？人们都在问。
    “信天翁”到哪里去了
    今年波恩锦标赛财政上有些问题，观众购票迟疑。主管人暗暗埋怨有名的“信天翁”米夏埃尔·格罗斯：要是他出场参赛，票早痛痛快快卖出去了。这个“信天翁”飞到哪里去了？其实哪儿也没去，他还要来观战。但是自从去年奥运会后他就想休息一下，考虑一下今后的职业问题。目前他正集中力量写他的考试论文，题目是《作为政治家的席勒》。这次他要为报社写评论，给电视二台当评论员。原来他也在梦想当记者。
    多瑙河的“五重奏”音色如何
    多瑙河畔的匈牙利有个“五重奏”小组，不可小觑。他们是达尔尼、萨博、居特勒、戴布纳和埃格尔斯采吉（女）。达尔尼自从1985年以来在混合泳方面始终领先，曾获200和400米两项混合泳的两块奥运金牌、两块世界锦标赛金牌、四块欧洲锦标赛金牌；埃格尔斯采吉虽然8月16日才满15周岁，在奥运会已获200米仰泳金牌了；萨博这个前世界和欧洲冠军是长距离蛙泳最有希望的选手，人们指望他这次打破加拿大人维克多·戴维斯保持了5年之久的世界纪录呢。
