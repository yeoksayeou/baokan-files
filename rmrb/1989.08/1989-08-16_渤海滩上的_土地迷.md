	The "Land Enthusiast" on the Bohai Coast

	“Opening up an additional acre of wasteland can yield over 350 kilograms of grain per year.” Zhang An from Leting County, Hebei Province, holds this belief firmly. Since 1984, he has led his family and relatives to invest over 210,000 yuan, transforming over 1,000 acres of saline-alkali wasteland into rice fields. Over five years, they have provided society with over 1,500 tons of commercial grain, of which 475 tons were sold to the state at the fixed price. For this, Zhang An has been consecutively named a model worker and outstanding party member in Tangshan City in recent years.

	Zhang An is a resident of Guodong Village, Chengguanzhen, Leting County. He is now 60 years old and has been working with the land since he was 15. He loves the land, is willing to invest in it, and has become a true “land enthusiast.” In the 1970s, when he was the village party branch secretary, he led the villagers to dig soil and bury sand, creating an orchard of nearly 100 acres; he also led the masses to level 22 sand dunes and fill 9 large pits, turning 120 acres of sandy land into fertile fields.

	In 1982, Zhang An contracted 60 acres of wasteland to cultivate rice, earning over 7,000 yuan that year. Later, someone said this land was idle land for resettling immigrants, and without a second thought, he handed over the 60 acres the following year. In 1984, encouraged by the county party committee, he contracted another 674 acres of abandoned land and cultivated an additional 457 acres of virgin land. For three whole years, Zhang An, along with his entire family and some relatives, worked tirelessly on the Bohai Coast to build canals, construct ditches, shape ridges, build dams, construct roads, and level the land, turning the wasteland that the production team had failed to cultivate for over 10 years into fertile fields.

	Some immigrants saw that the land Zhang An had opened was convenient for transportation and had high yields, so they requested it. Zhang An quietly handed it over and took another piece of inferior land in exchange. Some people said Zhang An was too foolish, exchanging the good land he had painstakingly opened for inferior land. Zhang An said, “Seeing the saline-alkali land turn into rice fields and knowing that someone will take good care of it, I am content.”

	In 1987, Zhang An took on the task of opening up over 500 acres of wasteland. He worked for over two years, with 40 family members and relatives following his lead to build 1,500 meters of main canals, 20,000 meters of branch canals, 56 ridges, 16 ditches, 1,360 meters of dams, and to repair three rivers, moving a total of 100,000 cubic meters of soil. Just the agricultural infrastructure construction alone cost over 90,000 yuan, and together with building houses and purchasing machinery, pumps, pipes, and belts, the total investment was over 140,000 yuan. This year, 80% of the land has been planted with seedlings. The black-green rice seedlings shine brightly, promising a good harvest.

	Over the years, Zhang An and his family have opened up over 1,600 acres of wasteland, of which 1,240 acres have become fertile fields. Recently, his family signed a five-year contract with the relevant departments. Starting from 1990, his family will pay an annual contract fee equivalent to 100,000 kilograms of rice. Zhang An said, “I have what I have today all thanks to the party's good policies. I am a party member and must share the party's burdens.” Although in recent years he has earned 190,000 yuan less by selling grain to the state at the fixed price, this year he still signed a contract with the grain department to sell 100,000 kilograms of fixed-price rice.

    渤海滩上的“土地迷”
    魏体宏
    “多开一亩荒滩，一年就可以多打350多公斤粮食。”河北乐亭县张安就是抱定这样一个信念，带领家人和亲属自1984年以来，先后投入21万多元，将1000多亩盐碱荒滩辟成稻田的。5年间，他们向社会提供商品粮1500多吨，其中475吨平价交售给国家。为此，近年来，张安连续被评为唐山市劳动模范、优秀党员。
    张安是乐亭县城关镇郭董村人，今年已经60岁，从15岁起就与土地打交道。他热爱土地，舍得往土地上花心血，简直成了“土地迷”。70年代他担任村党支部书记时，就曾带领乡亲挖土埋沙，建成一个近百亩的果园；他还带领群众削平22个沙岗，填了9个大坑，把120亩沙地改造成良田……
    1982年，张安包了60亩荒地开垦种稻，当年获利7000多元。后来，有人说这块地属安置移民闲地，他二话没说，第二年就无偿把这60亩地交出了。1984年，在县委领导的鼓励下，他又承包了674亩撂荒地，同时开垦另外457亩生荒地。整整3年啊，张安带着全家人和一些亲戚成年累月在渤海滩上修渠、建槽、塑埝、筑坝、修路、平地，硬把生产队时搞了10多年也未搞成的荒滩变成了良田。
    一些移民看张安开出的这块地交通方便、产量高，就点名要。张安又默默地把它交出来，换了另一块孬地。有人说，张安太傻了，拿自己辛辛苦苦开出的好地换孬地。张安却说：“看着这盐碱疙瘩变成稻田，还有人乐意好好种，我就知足。”
    1987年张安又承包了开垦500多亩荒滩的任务。一干又是两年多，儿女、亲戚40多人，在老张带领下修建了干渠1500米，毛渠2万多米，塑埝56道，建槽16个，筑坝1360米，修整了三道河，共动土10万立方米，光农田基本建设工程就投资9万多元，连同建房和购置机、泵、管、带等共投资14万多元。今年，80％的地块都插上了秧。那黑绿色稻秧闪着亮光，预示着好收成。
    几年来，张安一家人开垦的荒地有1600多亩，其中1240亩已成为良田。最近，他家与有关部门签定了5年的承包合同。从1990年起，每年他家要上交承包费折合10万公斤稻谷。张安说，我之所以能有今天，全靠党的好政策，我是个党员，就要为党分忧。尽管近年来他因向国家卖平价粮已少收入了19万元，但今年他依然同粮食部门签定了交售10万公斤平价稻谷的合同。
