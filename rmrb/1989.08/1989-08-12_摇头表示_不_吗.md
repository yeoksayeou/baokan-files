Linguists say that language is a system of vocal symbols that humans use to convey information and express emotions. However, there also exists a form of silent language, such as sign language used by the deaf and mute to communicate.

In fact, people who can speak also often use movements of certain parts of their bodies to replace language and express thoughts and emotions, such as facial expressions, gestures, or body language. However, due to the vast differences in human race, region, history, cultural background, customs, and habits, the same action representing a silent language does not necessarily convey the same meaning or express the same emotion. It may even convey completely opposite information.

Thus, in addition to anthropologists, there are also experts in animal behavior who study human gestures to convey information. They are called "body language experts."

They collect the "silent language" of people from various countries and different regions within a country, classify and compare them, and find many interesting examples. Their research also provides valuable materials for cultural anthropology.

For example, the majority of people use shaking their head to mean "no," but Greeks, Turks, and Bulgarians use shaking their head to mean "yes." Touching the earlobe in front of a Spaniard or spreading out the palm in front of a Greek is considered intentional insult.

The most common gesture is making a circle with the thumb and index finger. This symbol means "agreement," "good," or "satisfaction" to Americans and most Western Europeans; some countries in the Mediterranean region consider it "a hole" or "zero"; Tunisians consider it "I want to kill you"; while Japanese people consider that circle to be a hint at "money." When talking about Japan, never tighten your belt in front of a Japanese person, because this action means committing seppuku (ritual suicide).

With the increase in international exchanges and the development of communication technology, some information or emotions expressed through body movements have already become internationalized. For example, shaking hands or embracing each other indicates friendship. During World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill often extended his index and middle fingers to form the letter "V" at public gatherings, expressing the confidence in victory (VICTORY). At that time, it was considered a unique information symbol created by Churchill, but now this gesture is widely used around the world.

French anthropologist Bernard Kouchner also noted that in 1986, when Corazon Aquino took office as the President of the Philippines, she extended her thumb and index finger to the cheering crowd, which is said to be a traditional gesture of success in the Philippines. For the Han Chinese, extending the thumb and index finger probably only means the number "eight."

    摇头表示“不”吗
    陈封
    语言学家说语言是人类用以传递信息、表达情感的有声符号系统，但同时也存在无声的语言，如聋哑人用手势交谈的哑语。
    其实有说话能力的人，也经常以自己身体某一部位的动作代替语言来表达思想和情感，如面部表情、手势或体态。可是，由于人类种族、地域、历史、文化背景、风俗习惯等等因素的千差万别，同样一个动作所代表的无声语言并不一定能够普遍地传递同样意义的信息，或表达同样的情感，甚至会传递完全相反的信息。
    于是现在除了人类学家之外，动物学家中也有了研究人类动作传递信息的专家，他们被称为“身体语言学家”。
    他们搜集世界各国以及一个国家不同地区居民的“无声语言”，加以分类和比较，发现许多有趣的实例。他们的研究也为文化人类学提供了宝贵的资料。
    例如绝大多数人都是以摇头表示“不”，而希腊人、土耳其人和保加利亚人却以摇头表示肯定；在西班牙人面前，用手触摸耳垂或在希腊人面前摊开手掌都被认为是有意侮辱。
    最常见的一种手势是以拇指和食指做成一个圈。这个符号在美国人和多数西欧人看来，是“同意”、“很好”、“满意”的意思；地中海区域某些国家的人则认为是“坑”或者“零”；突尼斯人认为那表示“我要杀死你”；而日本人认为那个圈是暗示“钱”。谈到日本，千万不要在日本人面前勒紧裤腰带，因为这个动作是表示要剖腹自杀。
    随着国际间交往的增多，传播技术的发展，一些以身体动作表达的信息或情感也已经国际化了。如相互握手或拥抱表示友好。第二次世界大战期间，英国首相丘吉尔在群众集会场所往往伸出中指和食指作成英文字母V形，表示胜利（VICTORY）的信心。那个时期曾被认为这是丘吉尔独创的信息符号，而现在这个手势已在世界上广泛运用了。
    法国人类学家伯纳德·柯希林还注意到，阿基诺夫人于一九八六年在就任菲律宾总统大会上，对欢呼的群众伸出了拇指和食指，据说这是菲律宾人表示成功的传统手势。而对中国汉族人来说，伸出拇指和食指，大概只表示数字“八”的意思。
