The North Tibetan Plateau, one of China's five major pastures, does not offer the picturesque scene of "wind blowing grass low to reveal cattle and sheep." The short grass, locally known as "naza," is rich in protein and ideal for cattle and sheep grazing.

Upon arriving in the North Tibetan Plateau, it is best to stop and taste the freshly squeezed cow and sheep milk. If the host generously offers raw meat and a knife, do not refuse or be surprised. Instead, act experienced by cutting a piece and slowly chewing it. This is the North Tibetan Plateau, where the ancient way of life still persists.

The North Tibetan Plateau, marked on the Tang Dynasty's maps of Tubo, is known in Tibetan as the "Northern Plateau." Legend has it that it was the battlefield of King Gesar. The North Tibetan Plateau covers more than two-thirds of Tibet's area, equivalent to eight Zhejiang provinces. Its northern boundary is generally considered to be the Kunlun and Tanggula Mountains, and its southern boundary is the Gangdise and Nyainqêntanglha Mountains. The average elevation here is over 4,500 meters, making it the place on Earth with the most sunlight but the least oxygen.

The North Tibetan Plateau has two major towns at its ends: Nagqu Town on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and Shiquanhe Town on the New Tibet Highway, which are the locations of the CPC Nagqu and Ali prefectural committees and administrative offices. Nagqu has historically been an important commercial hub and is relatively prosperous, while Shiquanhe is a new town located in the ancient Ali region known as the "Three Circles."

Traveling west from Nagqu, the population gradually thins out. The journey between counties is particularly long, with no towns or villages along the way. Sometimes, driving all day, you might only see a few herders. The only human-made landmarks are the prayer flags and mani stones left by pilgrims. The faithful companions on this journey are the grasslands, deserts, sand dunes, lakes, and glaciers, as well as possible encounters with towering volcanic rocks, the suture zone of the Eurasian Plate, Middle Stone Age relics on terraces, beautiful caves, and various marine deposits. The ancient sea from the Tertiary period has left many unexpected legacies here. On some islands, you can see tens of thousands of Mediterranean black-headed gulls; near Qilin Lake, geological teams and herders have seen lake beasts that resemble a mix of horse, cow, and sheep; herders in Cuoqin County have seen lake monsters resembling giant dragons in the Zharinamco Lake. Incidentally, Tibet is the province with the most lakes in China, with 88% of them located in the North Tibetan Plateau. There are 307 lakes larger than 5 square kilometers and 42 lakes larger than 100 square kilometers. The two lakes mentioned earlier, along with Nam Co and Dangra Yumco, are all over 1,000 square kilometers.

The North Tibetan Plateau is a paradise for adventurers. Those who have been there are always amazed by its wonders. At this moment, you might be traversing a no-man's-land, facing a sudden blizzard, encountering marshes that cars cannot pass through, or encountering wild animals. If you are driving alone and your car breaks down, with no one in sight, things can get tricky. Spending the night on the grassland, jokingly referred to as "being the commander," involves enduring the cold, hunger, and the threat of sudden animal attacks. At this moment, the lighthearted grassland romance is replaced by the heavy pressure of nature. How about that? Nature gives both beauty and harshness. At this time, think of the calmness of the North Tibetan Plateau herders in the face of death, and think of Jack London's "Love of Life," and you will become composed. Isn't that right? No matter where you go, you cannot escape the questions of life. Only by struggling can you overcome the various obstacles in life.

It seems a bit heavy, so let's tell a joke. It is said that a tax official from the old government once went to the western North Tibetan Plateau, feeling that his gun and spear had touched the sky (extremely high altitude), drinking water only in a pocket (ice blocks), and firewood tied to his waist (fire starter), it was truly out of reach, so he turned his horse around and stopped collecting taxes.

Perhaps it was after experiencing the hardships of the western North Tibetan Plateau that I have deep respect for the local people of the North Tibetan Plateau and the new North Tibetan Plateau people who came from the interior to participate in the construction. I remember in 1981, in Cuoqin County, I met a Han teacher. At that time, other Han officials had returned to the interior, but he was still teaching his Tibetan students. Last time I went to Nagqu, because of the interview on wind power generation, I met Comrade Sun Guangming, who is in charge of this work. He is an experienced old man but has the creative enthusiasm of a young person. On April 12, 1984, he and a few comrades braved a 11-level wind and installed the first wind power generator in Nagqu in a -34°C environment. Before that, people in that area had never seen electric lights. Now, the entire region has installed 287 wind power generators, with 9 wind power demonstration villages and 1 solar power demonstration village. In the face of ancient lifestyles and modern civilization, the North Tibetan Plateau herders have chosen the latter.

Like the border towns of Yadong, Zhangmu, and Gyilong in the Shigatse region, the Ali border also has many border markets. The transaction volume is not large, but the content is rich. A few years ago, you could see groups of "light cavalry" with sheep in the autumn, engaging in trade at the border markets. "Salt-grain exchange" is the traditional term for this activity, which means herders exchange salt (salt lakes are common in the grasslands) for farmers' grain, but it is not limited to this, and there are also exchanges of livestock products for industrial goods, etc. This ancient barter trade still exists today, but new markets have expanded, and the means of transportation have changed from sheep to trucks. Recently, colleagues from the Beijing Film Studio told me that to film the sheep caravan in "Ten Thousand Miles in Northern Tibet," they almost searched the entire North Tibetan Plateau and finally found one in the deep grass.

From the several Middle Stone Age sites discovered on the North Tibetan Plateau, it can be inferred that there have been humans living here for at least 10,000 years. Ten thousand years! In the river of human history, it is but a drop in the ocean. The North Tibetan Plateau still looks so "primitive" today. But one thing is deeply convincing: economic system reforms have broken the isolation of the North Tibetan Plateau, and the ancient way of life has changed. This is another historic change since the democratic reform in Tibet.

### 西去羌塘

    西去羌塘
    本报记者　卢小飞
    绿色羌塘虽是我国五大牧场之一，但却没有“风吹草低见牛羊”的景色。短小得像“寸头”的牧草，当地名叫“那扎”，蛋白含量极高，极适于牛羊的生长。
    去了羌塘，最好先停车去尝尝刚刚挤出的牛羊奶。如果主人慷慨地递来生肉和小刀，不要回绝，也不必惊愕，要故作老练地削上一条，慢慢地咀嚼。这就是羌塘，如今仍然是这样一种古老的生存状态。
    羌塘，唐朝的吐蕃地图上就标有这个地方。藏语叫“北方高原”，传说是格萨尔王驰骋的疆场。羌塘占西藏面积的2／3以上，相当于8个浙江省，通常认为其北界是昆仑山、唐古拉山，其南界是冈底斯山、念青唐古拉山。这里平均海拔4500米以上，是地球上拥有阳光最多、含氧却最少的地方。
    羌塘的两端各有一名镇：青藏线上的那曲镇和新藏线上的狮泉河镇，分别是中共那曲和阿里地委及行政公署所在地。那曲在历史上就是重要的商品集散地，相对繁荣一些；狮泉河是新兴的城镇，地处古代阿里的三围之中。
    从那曲西去，人烟逐渐稀少。县与县之间的旅途格外漫长，途中没有城镇、村落，有时车行一天也难得见到几个牧人。朝圣者留下的经幡、马尼（石头圣堆）似乎是仅有的人文景观。忠实伴旅是山原、荒漠、砂碛、湖泊和冰川，甚至可能遇到巍峨的火山岩、欧亚板块的缝合带、阶地上的中石器时代遗存、美丽的溶洞和深海的各种岩积。地质第三纪前的古海，给这里留下许多意想不到的遗产，在一些岛上，可以见到数以万计的地中海黑头鸥；在奇林湖畔，地质队员和牧民都曾见到似马似牛似羊的湖兽；措勤县牧民见过扎日南木湖里有形似巨龙的水兽。顺便说，西藏是我国湖泊最多的省区，其中88％分布在羌塘，5平方公里以上的湖有307个，100平方公里以上的湖有42个，前面提到的两个湖和纳木湖、当若雍湖都在1000平方公里以上。
    羌塘是探险家的乐园，凡去过的，无不感叹那造化的神奇。而此时，你或许正穿行无人区，可能正面临一场突如其来的暴风雪，可能遇到汽车难以通过的沼泽，也可能会遇到野兽。如果单车行驶，又出了故障，前不见古人后不见来者，事情就有些麻烦。在草原过夜，戏称为“当团长”，受冻挨饿，还要防备野兽的突然袭击。此时此刻，轻松的草原浪漫曲被沉重的自然压迫感取代了。怎么样？大自然给予的美妙与严酷同时而来。这时，想想羌塘牧民在死亡面前的沉静，想想杰克·伦敦的《热爱生命》，你会坦然起来。不是么？走到哪儿也不能躲过人生的命题，只有搏击，才会超越人生的各种障碍。
    似乎有些沉重，说个笑话。据传旧政府的税务官曾到了西部羌塘，只觉枪叉子碰着了天（海拔极高），喝水只能用口袋（冰块），火种都拴在腰上（火镰），实在是鞭长莫及，他调转马头，不再收税了。
    大概是经历过西部羌塘的磨难，我对于世居的羌塘人和不远万里从祖国内地来参加建设的新羌塘人怀有深深的敬意。记得1981年在措勤县遇到一个汉族教师，当时县里其他汉族干部都陆续内返了，只有他还安心地教着他的藏族学生。前次去那曲，因为采访风能发电，认识了主管这项工作的孙光明同志。这是位饱经风霜的老者，却有着青年人的创造热情。1984年4月12日，他和几个同志顶着11级大风，在零下34摄氏度的室外安装起那曲的第一台风能发电机。在这之前，那一带人还没见过电灯。如今全区已安装了287个风能发电机，有9个风能发电示范村，1个太阳能发电示范村。在古老的生活方式和现代文明面前，羌塘牧民选择了后者。
    如同日喀则地区的亚东、樟木、吉隆等边境口岸，阿里边境也发育着许多边境市场，成交额不算大，内容挺丰富，早几年，可以在秋季见到驮羊组队的“轻骑兵”，到边贸市场从事交易。“盐粮交换”是这一活动的传统叫法，顾名思义，牧民用盐（草原上盐湖极多）换农民的粮，当然不限于这个，还有诸如畜产品换工业品等等。这种古老的以物易物贸易今天依然存在，但新市场扩展了，交通工具也由驮羊改为卡车。前不久，北京科影厂的同志告诉我，为了拍到《万里藏北》中的驮羊队，他们几乎跑遍了羌塘，好不容易在原草深处找到一支。
    从羌塘草原上发现的几处中石器时代遗迹来看，至少在一万年以前羌塘就有人类生存。一万年呐！在人类的长河中，不过沧海一粟，羌塘现在看上去还那么“原始”。但有一点深为人们信服：经济体制改革打破了羌塘的封闭，古老的生存状态发生变化了，这是继西藏民主改革后的又一次历史性巨变。
