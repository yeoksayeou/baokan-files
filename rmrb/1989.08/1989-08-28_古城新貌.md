    The ancient city of Xi'an, formerly known as Chang'an, is a renowned historical and cultural city. Before liberation, the city's public utilities were rudimentary and incomplete, with "dim electric lights, uneven roads, and unreliable telephones." The urban area covered only 13.2 square kilometers. On May 20, 1949, Xi'an was liberated and embarked on the path of socialism, significantly improving and upgrading its public utilities. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Xi'an, under the guidance of the policy of "reform, opening up, and revitalization," has seen its urban landscape undergo remarkable changes.

    — The road network has taken shape. By the end of 1988, the city had 788 roads with a total length of 556 kilometers, which is 5.8 times the length in 1949.

    — Public transportation has improved. By the end of 1988, the city had 817 public transport vehicles with a total passenger volume of 460 million. Together with 2,348 taxis, the situation of "difficulty in getting a ride" has been somewhat alleviated.

    — Water supply and drainage construction has accelerated. Alongside the construction of the fourth phase of the water supply project and the expansion of the Qishui surface water project, the Black River water diversion project, with a total investment of 710 million yuan and a water diversion capacity of 800,000 tons per day, began construction in 1987. The first phase, with a daily water intake of 450,000 tons, is scheduled to be completed and operational in 1990. The total length of urban drainage pipes has increased from 323 kilometers to 603 kilometers, and the Dengjiacun sewage treatment plant has been expanded.

    — Gas and heating supply have developed. The number of households using piped gas has reached 50,000, and the number of households using liquefied gas cylinders has exceeded 12,000, ending the city's history of having no gas supply.

    — Parks and greenery have been transformed. Over the past 40 years since liberation, in addition to renovating and rebuilding the original Lianhu, Revolutionary, and Children's Parks, new parks such as Xingqing Palace, Labor, and Textile City have been built, along with the Great Wild Goose Pagoda Bonsai Garden, Botanical Garden, and Zoo. The Ming Dynasty city wall has been repaired for 13.7 kilometers, the surrounding river has been treated for 14.6 kilometers, and over 70 hectares of green spaces have been opened up around the city. This has initially formed a city tour framework of the city wall, city river, and surrounding green belt, making the ancient city more attractive.

　　古城新貌
    西安，古称长安，是名闻遐迩的历史文化名城，解放前夕，市政公用设施简陋残缺，“电灯不明，马路不平，电话不灵”，市区面积仅有13.2平方公里。1949年5月20日，西安解放，走上了社会主义的康庄大道，市政公用设施有了很大改善和提高。十一届三中全会后，西安在“改革、开放、搞活”方针指引下建设城市，城市面貌发生日新月异的变化。
    ——道路网络已经形成。到1988年底，全市共有道路788条，总长度达到556公里，相当于1949年的5.8倍。
    ——公共交通状况有所改善。到1988年底，全市拥有公交营运车辆817部，客运总量达4.6亿多人次。加上出租汽车2348辆，使“乘车难”的状况有所缓解。
    ——给水、排水建设加快。在新建四期供水工程和扩建浐河地面水工程的同时，总投资7.1亿元，引水量达80万吨／日的黑河引水工程，已于1987年动工兴建，日取水45万吨的第一期工程将于1990年竣工通水。城市排水管道总长度由323公里增加到603公里，并扩建了邓家村污水处理厂。
    ——煤气、供热有所发展。全市管道煤气的用户已发展到5万户，液化罐装气的用户也发展到1.2万多户；结束了全市没有煤气的历史。
    ——园林绿化面目一新。解放40年来，除整修、改建了原有的莲湖、革命和儿童公园外，还新建了兴庆宫、劳动、纺织城等公园，以及大雁塔盆景园、植物园和动物园，已整修明代城墙13.7公里，整治环城河14.6公里，开辟环城绿地70多公顷，初步形成了城墙、城河、环城林带三位一体的环城游览骨架，使古城更具有引人的魅力。　（薛勇）
