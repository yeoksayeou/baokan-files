Currently, the world's food production exceeds consumption by 10%, and feeding 5 billion people is not a problem. However, why are more than 500 million people still suffering from hunger? The main reasons are as follows:

1. A few countries and regions have surpluses, while most have shortages. The United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and the European Economic Community are the world's five largest food exporters. In the 1986-1987 period, they exported a total of 82.5 million tons of wheat. However, many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe have insufficient food production and need to import large quantities. These countries imported 83.3 million tons of wheat alone in the 1986-1987 period.

2. The population growth rate in developing countries exceeds the food growth rate. Currently, the countries with the most severe food shortages are those with extremely high population growth rates. In the early 1980s, of the 80 million people added annually, 75 million were in developing countries. Although these countries' food growth rate reached 3.1% in the 1970s, surpassing developed countries, their higher population growth rate negated the food growth effect.

3. Food-deficient countries either lack the means to import food or face transportation difficulties, causing residents to go hungry. Some African countries, due to economic difficulties, cannot produce enough food to meet national needs and cannot afford to import food to make up for domestic shortages. Even if they receive international food aid, transportation difficulties prevent the timely delivery of food to the hungry.

4. Two-thirds of the world's population live in areas with limited arable land, where more than three-quarters of the arable land is already cultivated. Food production mainly relies on agricultural technology.

The world's food production pattern has not always been this way. As early as the 1930s, only Western Europe was short of food, while other places had enough food. Apart from the largest grain producer, North America, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could export 500 million tons of grain annually, and Latin America could export 900 million tons. By the 1950s, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Africa had no grain exports, while North America, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand could still export grain. Only Western Europe and Asia completely relied on grain imports. In the 1970s until 1984, Latin America became a grain-importing region, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe imported large quantities of grain, Africa became the world's second-largest grain buyer, and Asia's grain imports continued to increase. The European Community countries, like the United States and Canada, became major grain exporters. This change in pattern is thought-provoking and tells us a simple truth: everything depends on human effort.

The European Economic Community countries adopted subsidies to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for grain production, transforming the EEC from a grain-importing region to a grain-exporting region.

In the past 30 years, through fertilization, irrigation, the use of pesticides, and genetic engineering to cultivate early-maturing, high-yield varieties, crop yields per unit of arable land have significantly increased. Countries south of the Sahara, following China and India, implemented the "Green Revolution," and the world's grain production increased significantly, from 624 million tons in 1950 to a record high of 1.863 billion tons in the 1986-1987 period, nearly doubling. Per capita grain availability also increased from 260 kilograms to 330 kilograms. Irrigation can significantly increase grain production.

However, currently, only about 15% of the world's arable land is irrigated, and in Africa, it is only 2%. Additionally, the world's arable land area can still be expanded, as the current global land cultivation index is only 11.2%. Some countries are even below 1%. Therefore, the world's grain production has encouraging aspects.

    浅谈世界粮食问题
    杨贵兰
    目前世界的粮食产量比其消费量多出10％，50亿人口的温饱不成问题。然而，为什么仍有5亿以上的人在受饥挨饿呢？其主要原因如下：
    1、少数国家和地区生产过剩，多数国家和地区生产不足。美国、加拿大、阿根廷、澳大利亚和欧洲经济共同体等五个国家和地区的粮食生产大量过剩，因而成为世界5大粮食出口国和地区，1986——1987年度，它们共出口小麦8250万吨。但是，亚、非、拉美和东欧的许多国家却因粮食生产不足而需要大量进口，这些国家仅在1986——1987年度的小麦进口量就达8330万吨。
    2、发展中国家的人口增长速度超过粮食增长速度。在当今的世界上，缺粮最严重的国家正是那些人口增长速度极高的国家。80年代初，每年增长的8000万人中有7500万属于发展中国家，尽管这些国家的粮食增长率在70年代曾高达3.1％，超过了发达国家，但其更高的人口增长率使其粮食增长效果化为乌有。
    3、缺粮国或因无力进口，或因交通不便而使居民挨饿。非洲一些国家，由于经济困难，既不能生产足够的粮食来满足国民的需求，也无力从国际市场进口来弥补国内的粮食亏空，即使得到了国际社会的粮食援助，也因交通不便而不能及时将粮食送到饥民手中。
    4、世界2／3的人生活在耕地短缺地区，那里可耕地3／4以上已耕种，粮食增产主要靠农业技术。
    世界的粮食生产格局并非一直如此。早在30年代，世界上只有西欧缺粮，其他地方的粮食都自给有余。除最大粮仓北美外，苏联、东欧每年均可出口粮食500万吨，拉美每年可出口900万吨。至50年代，苏联、东欧和非洲已无粮出口，北美、拉美、澳大利亚和新西兰仍能出口粮食，只有西欧和亚洲完全依靠粮食进口。70年代至1984年，拉美成了粮食进口地区，苏联、东欧大量购进粮食，非洲成了世界第二大粮食买主，亚洲的粮食进口有增无减，而欧共体国家则同美国、加拿大等国一样，成了世界的粮食出口者。这一格局的变化是发人深思的，它至少可以告诉人们这样一个简单的道理：事在人为。
    欧州经济共同体国家采取补贴的办法来刺激农民生产粮食的积极性，从而使欧州经济共同体国家由粮食进口国一跃成了粮食出口国。
    最近30多年来，由于施肥、灌溉、施用杀虫剂、利用遗传工程培育早熟高产品种，使耕地单产大幅度提高，撒哈拉以南的国家继中国和印度之后推行“绿色革命”，世界的粮食产量明显提高，由1950年的6.24亿吨猛增至1986—1987年度的创纪录水平——18.63亿吨，增加了近2倍，人均粮食占有量也由260公斤上升到330公斤。灌溉可以使粮食大幅度增产。
    但是，目前全世界的水浇地仅占耕地总面积的不足15％，非洲仅为2％。另外，世界的耕地面积还可以扩大，因为目前全世界的土地垦殖指数仅达11.2％。有些国家甚至不足1％。由此看来，全世界的粮食生产有着令人欣慰的地方。
