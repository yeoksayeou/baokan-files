Recently, the newly formed Chinese women's volleyball team returned triumphantly from their tour of the Soviet Union, carrying the championship trophy. They did not hold the usual welcoming ceremony or a victory celebration. The post-match summary meeting on August 3 was also deliberately held in a secret location. We searched for the entire morning, and by the time we found the door, the meeting had already ended. The new coaches and players saw us and repeatedly waved their hands, declining the interview, even with the presence of Zhang Jian, the deputy director of the State Sports General Administration's Training Bureau, pleading on our behalf.

Seeing this, Zhang Jian could only turn to explain to us that the women's volleyball team was doing this for the sake of "correcting mistakes and restoring order." Before the Seoul Olympics, the biggest lesson for the Chinese women's volleyball team was the inability to correctly handle victory. As honors increased, various activities unrelated to training also increased, affecting normal training and ultimately leading to a crucial defeat. Now, they are just starting out, so please understand.

According to Zhang Jian, the Chinese women's volleyball team not only maintains a consistent stance towards the outside world, describing the "Chinilin Cup" international women's volleyball invitational tournament held last month, which featured seven strong teams, as a "routine event," and downplaying their own five consecutive victories, defeating teams from the Soviet Union, Cuba, and East Germany as just a practice session. Internally, their understanding is also very unified. In the just-concluded summary meeting, they focused on finding gaps, identifying weak links, and defining improvement measures.

In fact, objectively speaking, the "Chinilin Cup" tournament featured top teams from various regions, with elite players from all over the world, and the level was not low. The Soviet Union team that took the field was the original lineup that won the Seoul Olympics; although the Cuban team had two key players absent, the "Caribbean Hurricane" led by Luis still defeated the Soviet Union team in this match. This game, at least, proved that the new Chinese women's volleyball team's strength is still among the world's best.

Zhang Jian said that this time, the girls of the women's volleyball team indeed played with confidence. However, the shortcomings were also very obvious. For example, compared to the Soviet and Cuban teams, they were still inferior in net battles and powerful attacks. Moreover, the new players of the Chinese women's volleyball team have rough techniques and lack coordination. It is reported that the Chinese women's volleyball team will address these shortcomings and go to Zhangzhou for intensive training on August 5, aiming to achieve new progress in the Asian Championships in October and the World Cup in November.

When it comes to training, Zhang Jian privately revealed that the new women's volleyball team, in his view, has a completely new look. Although Yuan Weimin himself went to watch the women's volleyball team train several times and could always find some problems, "this is still different from the old women's volleyball team's spirit two years ago." Zhang Jian also mentioned that the new coaching team not only strictly demands from the players in training but also learns from the old women's volleyball team's lessons, strengthening ideological and political work. Even small matters like how to treat people are strictly required. He said, as recently stated at the national volleyball work conference, the new women's volleyball team is a team full of vitality and hope.

Although we were unable to directly record the "main characters'" words and deeds this time, the fact that the Chinese women's volleyball team coaches and players maintained self-discipline and clarity after their first overseas victory gave us hope for the women's volleyball team to regain its glory.

    严于律己　再展英姿
    ——中国女排访苏归来采访纪实
    日前，出征苏联的新建中国女排捧杯凯旋，既没有搞例行的欢迎仪式，也没有举行庆功会，8月3日的赛后总结会也特意选在秘密地点进行。我们找了整整一上午，刚摸到门口，会议已经结束了。新教练、新队员们见到我们连连摆手，谢绝采访，纵是主管排球的国家体委训练局副局长张健在旁说情也无济于事。
    张健见状，只好转而向我们解释道，女排这样做也是为了“拨乱反正”。汉城奥运会前的中国女排，最大的教训就是不能正确对待胜利，随着荣誉的增加，各种各样同训练无关的活动也跟着增多，以致影响了正常的训练，最终导致了关键时刻的惨败。现在正是他们刚刚起步之际，请千万理解。
    据张健介绍说，中国女排不仅对外界口径一致，把上月底7支强队参加的苏联“奇尼林杯”国际女排邀请赛形容为“一般赛事”，将自己五战皆胜，连克苏、古、民主德国队的成绩轻描淡写为一次演练，内部认识也非常统一。在刚刚结束的总结会上，着重在找差距，查薄弱环节，定改进措施。
    其实，客观地讲，“奇尼林杯”赛诸路劲旅汇集，各方排坛精英荟萃，水平并不低。苏联队上场的是汉城奥运会的夺魁原班人马；古巴队虽有两员主力缺阵，但由路易斯领衔的“加勒比旋风”仍在此次比赛中击败了苏联队。此役，起码证明了新的中国女排实力仍在世界前列。
    张健说，这次比赛，女排姑娘们的确打出了信心。但是，不足之处也同样十分明显。比如和苏古两队相比，网上争夺和强攻，还是人家占上风。而且中国女排新队员技术尚粗糙，配合欠默契。据悉，中国女排将针对存在的这些不足之处，于8月5日赴漳州继续闭门苦练，力争在今年10月份的亚洲锦标赛和11月份的世界杯赛上，实现新的进步。
    谈到训练，张健私下透露，新女排在他看来已是面貌一新。虽然袁伟民本人几次去看女排训练，总能挑出一些毛病，“但这毕竟已不同于前两年老女排的精神面貌了”。张健还特意提到，新的教练班子不仅在训练上严格要求队员，还吸取老女排的教训，加强了思想政治工作。像如何待人接物这样的小事，点滴不放，也从严要求。他说，正如最近召开的全国排球工作会议所认为的那样，新女排是一支充满了朝气、充满了希望的队伍。
    尽管我们这次采访未能直接收录“主角”的言行，但中国女排教练和队员们在首次出征大获全胜之后，仍能严于自律，保持清醒一事，却使我们看到了中国女排重展英姿的希望所在。
