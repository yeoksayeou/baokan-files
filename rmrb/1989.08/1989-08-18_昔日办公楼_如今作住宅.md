	Office Buildings of Yesteryear Now Residences
	By Xǔ Hóngzhì, Correspondent of this newspaper

	In the Václav Square of Prague, a building once had a sign for a subsidiary unit of a certain department. During the institutional reform, this unit was dissolved, and the sign was removed. An entire floor, including 12 offices, a conference room, and other rooms, totaling 230 square meters, was vacated. The relevant department decided to renovate these office spaces into residences, thereby improving the living conditions of some employees.

	Streamlining institutions is one of the major reform measures in Czechoslovakia. As the reform deepens, the number of administrative management personnel has decreased, and some units have been dissolved or merged. Many office buildings have become available. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia proposed to convert the vacated buildings into residential housing or service facilities and medical institutions. This measure is very popular among the people.

	In the capital, Prague, there were nearly 100 federal and Czechoslovak Republic management institutions and 47 general management offices. Meanwhile, the municipal authorities received 37,000 housing applications. The vacating of many office buildings has provided new possibilities for improving residents' housing conditions and brought new hope to those in need of housing.

	The Czechoslovak Republic government established a standing committee to oversee this work. Some people doubt whether office buildings can be converted into residences. However, the Prague municipal authorities are very confident. Even if some buildings are difficult to convert into residences, they can be used as service facilities or to relocate some institutions currently occupying residential buildings. For example, in the 4th district of Prague alone, 170 residential units are currently occupied by outpatient clinics and medical centers. Relocating these facilities out of residential buildings would solve the housing problem for 170 households.

	Prague residents are also actively participating in discussions, proposing suggestions on how to specifically utilize each office building. For example, near the "Flora" metro station, there is a newly built building originally intended for the Ministry of Electrical Engineering. However, since last year, this ministry and others have merged. The new office building is no longer needed. There is ongoing debate about its future use, but one point is clear: the first floor should be open to service industries.

### 昔日办公楼　如今作住宅

    昔日办公楼　如今作住宅
    本报记者　许宏治
    布拉格瓦茨拉夫广场上，一座楼房门旁原来挂着某部一个下属单位的牌子。在机构改革中，这个单位被撤销，这块牌子也被摘下了，腾出了整整一层楼，包括12间办公室、一个会议室以及其他房间，共230平方米。有关部门决定将这些办公用房改建为住宅，使一些职工的住房条件得到改善。
    精简机构是捷克斯洛伐克的重大改革措施之一。随着改革的深入，行政管理机关的工作人员减少了，一些单位被撤销或合并。机关的办公用房可以腾出来不少。捷共中央提出，将精简机构腾出的房屋改作居民住宅或服务设施、医疗机构。这一措施很受群众欢迎。
    在首都布拉格，原设有近百个联邦及捷克共和国管理机构，47个总管理处。与此同时，市政当局收到的住房申请达3.7万份。大批办公楼的腾出为改善居民住房条件提供了新的可能性，给缺房户带来了新的希望。
    捷克共和国政府成立了常设委员会负责这项工作。有人对办公楼能否改作住宅表示怀疑。但布拉格市政当局对此很有信心。即使一部分房屋难以改建为住宅，也可用作服务设施，或把目前占用着住房的一些机构搬进去。例如，仅布拉格第4区，现在就有170套住房被门诊部、医疗所占用。把它们搬出住宅楼，就能为170户居民解决住房问题。
    布拉格市民也积极参加讨论，对如何具体利用每一座办公楼提出建议。例如，“格拉德昌期卡”地铁站附近有一座新建楼房，本打算用作电机工业部的办公楼。但从去年起，该部和其他部合并。新办公楼用不着了。关于它该作何用途，人们正在进行争论，但有一点已经明确：第一层应为服务行业敞开大门。
