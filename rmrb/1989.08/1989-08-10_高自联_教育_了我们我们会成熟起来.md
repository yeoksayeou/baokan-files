Recently, newspapers have published numerous articles exposing the truth about how a small number of people instigated turmoil and a counter-revolutionary rebellion. What I want to talk about here is my own journey of changing thoughts. Within the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation (BSAF), I did not hold any key positions, but in terms of ideology, I could be considered a core member. However, the facts have educated me. Please believe the people that, in the face of facts, university students can improve their understanding.

First, before April 26, I had never heard the BSAF arrange for anti-corruption efforts within the campus. On April 27, the slogans for the march suddenly changed. At that time, although I found it strange, my inner bias was hoping that it was true, so I did not pay much attention to it, only feeling exhilarated. After April 27, I gradually felt something was amiss. First, I saw Wū'ěrkāixī being escorted in and out of the school gate by a special car, with two female students serving as his secretaries. This made me uncomfortable. Later, I heard from classmates that Wū'ěrkāixī had lost over 7,000 yuan due to illegal trading of furs and daggers from Xinjiang, and relevant departments were investigating the matter. Initially, I was skeptical, but when I asked his secretary, she mysteriously told me that there was indeed something, but we should be wary of "official" propaganda. I was very disgusted. Those who advocate for anti-corruption should be clean themselves. A small-time trader being so eager to lead us in "fighting corruption" seemed illogical. Later, I saw Wū'ěrkāixī frequently visiting large hotels. Even after participating in the hunger strike on May 13, on May 15, I still saw him having a hearty meal somewhere. How could such a person genuinely lead us in the "struggle" without personal gain? Another BSAF leader in charge of finances fled with the money, which shocked me even more. On May 25, the situation on the square was very difficult. Students from outside Beijing could not get decent meals, and Beijing residents had long lost their enthusiasm for donations. Just as we were worried about how to continue, news came that the BSAF financial director had fled with tens of thousands of yuan. Although this news was suppressed, it still leaked out. Because a replacement had to be found for the position. The students were very angry. Just before and after this incident, the "kidnapping" of Chái Líng happened. One day, the commander of the square, Chái Líng, suddenly disappeared. We guessed she must have been arrested by the "officials." Just as we were ready to take action, news came that Chái Líng had returned. Everyone was puzzled, and the leaders were tight-lipped. After much investigation, it was found that there had been internal strife, and some people suspected Chái Líng of financial impropriety, so she was isolated and interrogated. In any case, mutual suspicion and power struggles were terrible. There was also one day in April when I went to Peking University to see the big and small character posters. I happened to hear Wáng Dān giving a broadcast speech. Because a small character poster said he misused public donations, he was shouting loudly in defense. But after listening for a while, my doubts grew. He said that he was not afraid of attacks and slander against him, and he had already made a statement at a press conference in the Shangri-La Hotel. A scholar, how could he have the funds to rent such a room for a meeting? It was like saying "there is no silver here" to cover up the truth. If it were just one person or one incident, it could be overlooked. But such things happened frequently and were everywhere, making one's heart cold. Seeing the advertisements everywhere asking the public to donate money, cigarettes, and drinks, and seeing the BSAF leaders' extravagant spending, I naturally came to a conclusion: relying on these people to lead the anti-corruption movement would not work.

Second, on the afternoon of June 5, an incident at the gate of Beijing Normal University caused a significant change in my thoughts. At that time, a group of people, including BSAF members and ordinary students, were discussing the events of the early morning of June 4. A person suddenly rushed in and said, "You are all wrong. I saw it. I escaped from there. The PLA did not shoot people." Before he could finish, he was punched a few times, and then beaten mercilessly, until his face was covered in blood. When he struggled out with a bloody face, it was clear that he was trying to say that the PLA had used bayonets to stab people. The surrounding people finally realized. Today, it is obvious that this was a rumor. But I was very puzzled. Among the people who beat him, there was a student who often said, "I may not agree with your opinion, but I will defend your right to speak with my life." At this moment, he showed no intention of upholding this statement. I angrily took a photo of them beating him, letting this photo serve as a permanent record to tell future juniors and seniors what "big democracy" is. This incident made me think of many other things. For example, our school is not far from Beijing University of Technology. At the end of April and beginning of May, I saw something there. One evening, several hundred students, led by a man surnamed Liu, surrounded the student union to seize power. I thought that since this was a struggle for democracy, we should use democratic methods. However, what I saw was a different scene: many people were holding sticks, and a few student union members were surrounded inside. The leader knocked on the student union office door every 20-30 minutes, threatening to hand over the office and the seal.

My girlfriend studies at Renmin University of China. At the end of April this year, when Renmin University went on strike, she did not want to participate in the strike organized by some people, but someone set up checkpoints to prevent teachers and students from entering the classroom. Some students who entered the classroom were pushed out. She once told me, "I never thought that the democratic movement would be like this." As for the big and small character posters attacking and slandering individuals within the campus, there were even more. I initially thought that student cadres who did not participate in the democratic movement should be criticized. Later, I gradually felt that democracy should be combined with the rule of law, and criticizing people was wrong. One night, I saw a small leader of our school's self-governing committee posting a big character poster on the committee secretary and the student union chairman. I really couldn't bear to watch, so I advised him, "Don't post it. It's all personal attacks. Even during the U.S. presidential elections, this is not allowed." But he said, "You mind your own business. The Communist Party is against comprehensive Westernization, right? I'm doing this to shoot the chicken that sticks its head out, see who dares to stop us." I said, "You are already violating the law, what if you are charged with defamation in the future?" He said, "For the sake of democracy, who cares about the law?" I felt very sad. With such quality, what democracy are they fighting for? Later, I wrote a memorial, keeping all his words and actions at that time, as well as photos of the big character poster he posted. I just wanted to prove that I did not participate in defaming others.

One day, I went to the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes and saw some people writing articles. I asked and found out they were students from Beijing University of Technology. It was said that more than ten of their school's students were responsible for the propaganda work on the square. A short, thin male student was writing a letter from the worker masses. I asked, "What are you doing?" He smiled at me and said, "I am the spokesperson for the masses." I said, "You criticized the letters in the newspapers as being fabricated, do you have any evidence?" He replied, "There might be, I didn't see it." From then on, I completely lost trust in the BSAF's propaganda. Things like the 27th Army and the 38th Army fighting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declaring independence, and Shanghai not recognizing the "fake central government" were laughable. If I say something fair, actually, the BSAF leaders were sometimes deceived by the rumors they originally fabricated themselves. For example, on May 22, the square broadcasted a message saying that paratroopers would come that night. This was nonsense, but I observed that some BSAF leaders were very nervous. There was a student surnamed Xiào from Renmin University who claimed to be a special correspondent for the Township Enterprise News and a well-informed person. He was very active on the square, and many people knew him. BSAF leaders like Wáng Dān had a close relationship with him. One day, he said in front of everyone that 50,000 workers in Anshan went on strike to support us, and nearly 10,000 workers in Wuhan also went on strike to support us, and he gave details. A while later, he went to another place and spread this news, saying that the source of the information was that he heard it from me. I was standing behind him, and he didn't notice me. To "maintain the overall situation," I didn't refute him at the time. But I felt that these people were really unreliable.

I met Liu Jiang on the evening of a Friday at the salon in Yuanmingyuan. He once said, "I have been exposed and cannot easily show my face. I should only act behind the scenes, like Zhou Yongjun from the China University of Political Science and Law, and Chái Líng from Beijing Normal University, who are suitable for appearing in public." From what I understand, it seems that there are also significant internal conflicts within the BSAF. Sometimes, they fight fiercely over small matters. One day, I heard Liu Jiang say that someone was really unworthy. It turned out that during a BSAF meeting, due to differing opinions, they fought each other, hitting each other fiercely. Through Liu Jiang, I learned some information: first, foreign forces were heavily involved. A Ms. Pan, living in the Beijing Hotel, provided the square with a large amount of financial support. It is said that she is from Hong Kong and has a Taiwanese background. Second, there are Americans who specifically provide propaganda broadcasting equipment, such as the Peking University broadcasting station, which was armed by them. There are also other channels, such as the broadcasting equipment of the Workers' Autonomous Federation, which was sponsored by a certain company. The more I listened, the more frightened I became. These forces and our students' thoughts are miles apart. I finally understood that student movements are not purely spontaneous and are not free from political forces. I also made up my mind to withdraw early and retire from the current.

My understanding may be far from the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, but this is derived from practice. The evil leaders of the BSAF advocated "seeking democracy and fighting corruption" very hypocritically. They are actually seeking personal gain and dream of becoming famous figures, advocating anarchism and servility to foreigners. Now, many of my classmates have begun to seriously and calmly reflect. It is not ruled out that some people may go down the wrong path. However, the thoughts of most students have changed significantly. Please believe us, we will mature!

    高自联“教育”了我们我们会成熟起来
    李南
    最近，报刊上连续登载了许多文章，揭露极少数人制造动乱和反革命暴乱的真相。我这里要说的是我思想转变的历程。在“高自联”内我并没有什么关键职务，但在思想上我可以算个中坚分子。但是事实教育了我。请人民相信，在事实面前，大学生是会提高认识的。
    一，4月26日以前，我在校园内从未听到“高自联”布置反腐败的问题。4月27日游行口号一下子变了。我当时虽然也觉奇怪，但内心是有倾向性的，希望这是真的，所以并不在意，只觉得痛快。27日以后，慢慢觉得不对劲了。首先，看到我校吾尔开希进出校门专车接送，还有两名女同学给他当秘书随侍左右，觉得很不顺眼。随后，又听同学说吾尔开希因从新疆倒卖皮货和匕首赔款7000余元，有关部门正在追查。开始我还将信将疑，当问到吾的秘书时，她诡秘地告诉我，事情是有的，但要警惕“官方”做文章。对此我十分反感。反腐败的人，首先应该清廉。一个“小倒爷”这么热衷于反腐败似乎不合逻辑。再随后，又看到吾尔开希经常出入大饭店，即使是5月13日他参加绝食后，5月15日我还看到他在某处饱餐一顿。这样的人，怎么会不为私利而真诚带领我们“斗争”呢？“高自联”另一个负责财政的头头携款逃跑，对我震动更大。5月25日，广场上“斗争”处于很困难的境地，外地来京学生吃不上可口的饭菜，北京市民早已失去往昔捐款的热情，正当我们为如何坚持下去发愁时，突然传来一个消息：“高自联”财政部长携万元巨款溜走了。这个消息虽几经封锁，但还是传出来了。因为，要物色一位同学接替工作。同学们太气愤了。就在这件事发生前后，又发生了柴玲被“绑架”事件。某日，广场总指挥柴玲突然不见了。我们猜测一定是被“官方”抓走了。正当摩拳擦掌要大干一场之际，忽然传来消息：柴玲回来了。大家莫名其妙，领导讳莫如深。几经打听，才知道是起了内哄，一些人怀疑柴玲在钱财上手脚不干净，对她实行隔离审查。不管怎样，相互猜忌，争权夺利，真是糟透了。还有4月的一天，我到北大去看大小字报，恰逢王丹发表广播讲话。因有张小字报说他滥用群众捐款，他正声嘶力竭地辩白。但听了一段，不禁疑心更起。他说，对他的攻击、诬蔑他是不怕的，他已在香格里拉饭店举行记者招待会作了声明。一介书生，何来款项租下如此房间召开会议呢？真是此地无银三百两。如果是一人一事偶然发生也就罢了。但这类事情屡见不鲜，比比皆是，则让人实在心寒。看到到处张贴的让群众捐钱、捐烟、捐饮料的广告，看着“高自联”领导人大吃大嚼的挥霍，我自然得出了一个结论：靠这帮人领导反不了腐败。
    二，6月5日下午，在北师大门口发生了一件事，使我思想上发生了很大的变化。当时一群人包括“高自联”的人和一般同学，正围在一起讨论4日凌晨发生的事。一个人钻进来说，你们讲的都不对，我看见了，我从那儿逃出来的，解放军没有用枪打人。话音未落，他就被打了几拳，随后就是劈头盖脸的毒打，直打得血流满面，人打他的时候只听他喊，但听不清内容。当他满脸是血挣脱出来的时候，才闹明白，他是想说，解放军是用枪刺挑人了。周围的人才恍然大悟。今天看来显然是谣言。但我却十分不理解，打人的人中有个同学平时非常爱说：“我也许不同意你的观点，但我却要用生命捍卫你说话的权利。”此时，他打人的狠毒劲，丝毫没有履行这句话的意思。我气愤地用照相机照下了他们打人时的尊容，让这帧照片作为永久的历史，告诉未来的学弟、学妹，“大民主”是个什么东西吧。这件事又使我联想起许多事。例如：我们学校离北京科技大学不很远，4月底5月初，我到科大还看到一件事。一天晚上，有几百名学生在一个姓刘的人带领下，围学生会，要夺权。我以为既然是争取民主的一场斗争，我们就要用民主的方法。没想到看到的却是另一种场景：许多人手持棍棒，几位学生会干部被围在里面。带头的人每隔二三十分钟敲一下学生会办公室的门，威胁着让交出办公室，交出印章。
    我的女朋友在中国人民大学念书，今年4月底中国人民大学罢课时，她本不想参加某些人组织的罢课，但有人设置纠察线不让老师、同学进教室。还有的同学进了教室又被推出来。她曾对我说，没想到民主运动就是这个样子。至于在校园内攻击、诬蔑人身的大字报、小字报就更多了。我开始看时，觉得学生干部不参加民主运动该骂。后来，渐渐觉得民主应该和法制结合起来，骂人总是错的。一天夜里，我看到我校自治会的一个小头头给团委书记和学生会主席贴大字报。我实在看不下去，就劝他说：别贴了，全是人身攻击。美国竞选总统时都不许这样干。但他说，你别管，共产党不是反对全盘西化吗？我这样做叫枪打出头鸟，看他们谁敢阻拦我们。我说，你这样做，已经触犯了刑律，将来追你诽谤他人罪怎么办？他说，为了争取民主，怕他们什么法律。我觉得太悲哀了。这样的素质，争什么民主？事后我做了一篇追记，把这个人当时的言行及他贴的大字报的照片全部保留下来，我只想证明，我没有参与诽谤他人。
    三，有一天，我到人民英雄纪念碑下，见一些人在赶写文章，一问是北方工业大学的同学，据说他们学校有十几位同学负责广场的宣传工作。一位男同学，个子不高，瘦瘦的，正在写一封工人群众来信。我问：你这是干什么？他冲我笑笑说：我是群众的代言人。我说：你们不是骂报纸上有的来信是编的吗？到底有没有证据？回答说：可能有，我没看见。从此，我对
  “高自联”的宣传完全失去了信任。什么27军和38军打起来了，什么外交部独立了，什么上海市不承认“伪中央”了。真是让人哭笑不得。如果说句公道话，其实“高自联”的头头有时也被原本是自己编的谣言，欺骗了自己。例如，5月22日，广场广播了一个消息说，晚上有空降兵来。这本是无稽之谈，但我就近观察，有的“高自联”的头头很紧张。人民大学有个姓肖的同学，自称是乡镇企业报的特约记者、消息灵通人士，在广场上很活跃。很多人都认识他，“高自联”的头头王丹等人跟他也是关系密切。有一天，他当着众人的面说鞍钢五万人罢工声援我们，武钢也有近万名工人声援、罢工，还讲了细节。过了一会儿，他到另一处又传播这个消息，却说消息来源是听我说的。我就站在他的背后，他没注意到我。我为了“顾全大局”，也没当时驳斥他。但我觉得这帮人实在靠不住。
    四，我是在周五晚上圆明园沙龙活动时认识刘刚的。他曾说，我暴露了，不能轻易露面，只宜在下面活动，像政法大学的周勇军，北师大的柴玲都适合出头露面。据我了解，似乎“高自联”内部也是不同势力矛盾很大。有时为一件小事打得不可开交。一天，听刘刚说某某太不像话了。原来，“高自联”开会时，因意见不合，竟拳脚相见，打得不亦乐乎。通过刘刚我了解了一些情况：一是国外势力插手很厉害。某潘女士，住在北京饭店，给广场以大量财力支持。据说，她是香港来的，有台湾的背景。二是美国来的，专门重点给宣传广播设备，像北大广播站就是他们武装起来的。还有其他渠道，如“工自联”的广播器材就是某公司资助的。不听还好，越听胆越虚。这些势力和我们同学想的相差千里。我总算明白了，学生运动没有纯自发的，也没有不被政治势力利用的。我也总算下了决心，及早撤身，激流勇退。
    我的认识也许离党的十三届四中全会精神差得很远，但这是从实践中得出来的。“高自联”坏头头鼓吹的“求民主、反腐败”是很虚伪的。他们骨子里是为个人谋出路，做梦都想成为风云人物，搞的是无政府主义、洋奴主义。现在我的很多同学都开始认真冷静地反思了。不能排除有的人可能一条道走到黑。但是，大多数同学的思想已经发生了很大的变化。请相信我们吧，我们会成熟起来的！
