    Officials Punished for Illegally Changing Guilty Verdict to Not Guilty

    In 1973, Liu Xunhua, the deputy principal of the state-run Linghai Farm School in Jiangsu, was sentenced to two years in prison by the Binhai County People's Court for hooliganism. Later, he appealed, but the court's review found his appeal unfounded and upheld the original verdict. By the end of 1987, Liu Xunhua was concerned that this matter would affect his teaching seniority and his evaluation for a teaching title, so he used his brother, Liu Xunkang, the president of the Sheyang County People's Court, to approach the president of the Binhai County People's Court, Zhang Kaiyu, to plead on his behalf. On March 15, 1988, Liu Xunhua went directly to Zhang Kaiyu and refused to leave. Zhang Kaiyu instructed the head of the Criminal Division II to secretly draft a revised judgment, altering Liu Xunhua's criminal facts, changing the number of female students he molested from three to one, and thus determining that "the circumstances were relatively minor, and the original judgment was inappropriate, changing the verdict to not guilty." This revised judgment was neither discussed by the collegial panel nor reviewed by the judicial committee. Liu Xunhua used this revised judgment to have his teaching seniority counted continuously, received a salary increase, and was evaluated as a senior high school teacher.

    Last November, the Yancity Intermediate People's Court and the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court learned of the situation and sent investigators to confirm the facts. In December of the same year, the Yancity Intermediate People's Court, in accordance with the judicial supervision procedure, legally revoked the Binhai County Court's judgment of not guilty for Liu Xunhua. On January 5 of this year, the Yancity Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection investigated and clarified the errors of Zhang Kaiyu and others. On July 18, the Yancity Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to expel Zhang Kaiyu from the party and recommended the removal of his position as president of the Binhai County People's Court (approved by the eighth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Second Yancity People's Congress); to give the head of the Criminal Division II a party warning and recommend a demerit in his administrative position; and to give Liu Xunkang, the president of the Sheyang County People's Court, a serious party warning and recommend a demotion in his administrative position.

    将有罪改无罪枉法者受处分
    江苏国营临海农场中学副校长刘训化，曾在1973年2月，因流氓罪被滨海县人民法院判处有期徒刑两年。后来他又申诉，经法院复查裁定，认为他申诉无理，维持原判。1987年底，刘训化怕这事影响教龄，对自己的教师职称评定不利，便通过哥哥、射阳县法院院长刘训侃找到滨海县人民法院院长张开宇说情。1988年3月15日，刘训化又找到张开宇，干脆坐下不走了。张开宇指示刑二庭某庭长偷偷起草了改判判决书，篡改刘训化的犯罪事实，将猥亵女学生3名改为1名，并因此认定“情节显属轻微，原判显属不当，改判无罪。”这份改判判决书，既没有经过合议庭合议，也没有经过审判委员会讨论。刘训化凭改判判决书，教龄连续计算，调升一级工资，评得了中学高级教师职称。
    去年11月，盐城市中级法院和江苏省高级人民法院得知情况派人调查得到证实。去年12月，盐城市中级法院根据审判监督程序，依法撤销了滨海县法院对刘训化改判无罪的判决书。今年1月5日，盐城市纪委立案查清了张开宇等人的错误事实。7月18日，中共盐城市委决定，开除张开宇的党籍，建议撤销滨海县法院院长职务（盐城市二届人大常委会第八次会议已通过）；给予那个刑二庭庭长党内警告处分，建议行政上给予记过处分；给予射阳县人民法院院长刘训侃党内严重警告处分，建议行政上给予降职处分。
