The Premier Li Peng today at the State Council's full meeting said that China's economic situation from January to July this year is good, with relatively stable development. The key areas of economic work for the next few months remain threefold: continuing to stabilize prices, striving for a good harvest in agriculture, and easing the imbalance between total supply and total demand.

The main agenda of today's State Council's full meeting is to report on the economic situation and deploy work for the next few months.

Premier Li Peng said that the relatively stable economic development in the first seven months is mainly reflected in three aspects: First, it avoided a major economic downturn, maintaining industrial growth of 10.6%, and did not experience the economic stagflation that some had predicted. Second, price control efforts have achieved results. The overall retail price level in the first half of this year increased by 25.5% compared to the same period last year, but of this, 18.5% was due to last year's price increases affecting this year, with only 7% being new price increases. Especially, the prices of "basket of goods" have been relatively stable, even showing a slight decrease, so the actual price increase felt by the people is lower than last year, and the people are satisfied with this. Third, the agricultural production situation is relatively good. The total summer grain production reached 93.55 million tons, an increase of 2.57 million tons compared to last year, reaching a historical high. Currently, the autumn crops are growing well. Although some areas have been severely affected by disasters, as long as no major disasters occur in the future, it is expected that this year's national agricultural production will have a good harvest.

Li Peng said that from the situation in the first half of the year, the improvement of the total demand exceeding total supply has not been achieved well. First, the compression of fixed asset investment has not achieved the expected results. This year, the planned scale of fixed asset investment for the whole society is to be reduced by 20% compared to last year, but in reality, it has only been controlled to the same level as last year, that is, it has just been controlled to prevent further growth. Second, the consumption fund remains high, with a growth rate still above 20%, higher than the growth rate of production development and national income and fiscal revenue. The problem of high social consumption and unequal distribution in society has not been alleviated. In controlling investment demand and consumption demand, a lot of work still needs to be done.

Regarding the economic work for the second half of the year, Li Peng said that the key areas of work are the following three: continuing to stabilize prices, striving for a good harvest in agriculture, and easing the imbalance between total supply and total demand.

He reiterated that the overall guiding principle for the next few months of work is to firmly and unshakably implement the reform and opening-up policy, and to resolutely carry out the rectification and adjustment. The rectification and adjustment are not in opposition to reform and opening-up. The purpose of carrying out the rectification and adjustment is to create a better environment and conditions for reform and opening-up. At the same time, during the period of rectification and adjustment, some reform and opening-up measures not only need to be continued but also need to be further deepened.

Regarding stabilizing prices, Li Peng said that in the next few months, there must be no slackening, and more decisive measures must be taken to control prices. For prices managed by the state, without the approval of the State Council, no one is allowed to raise prices arbitrarily, and violators will be severely punished. For prices managed by local governments and enterprises, strict control and necessary reporting systems must also be implemented, and the masses must be mobilized to supervise. Li Peng said that since this year, in addition to the two statistical methods of comparing with the same period last year and the newly added part this year, a new price index has been added, which takes 47 kinds of basic necessities and service fees for urban workers as the object. Thus, the focus of price control is placed on stabilizing the prices of basic living materials needed by middle and low-income residents. From the execution results, compared with December last year, the average price of basic living materials in urban areas across the country has risen by 1.4%, which is significantly lower than the increase last year.

Li Peng emphasized that striving for a good harvest in agriculture this year is a major event for stabilizing the overall situation. Currently, regions such as North China and Shandong must urgently do a good job in drought relief. All levels of government and relevant departments must do a good job in the mid-to-late management of crops, supply of agricultural production materials, preparation of procurement funds, and services during and after production to turn the hope of a bumper harvest into reality.

Regarding easing the imbalance of total demand exceeding total supply, Li Peng said that the main focus is on two aspects: first, continuing to firmly compress the scale of fixed asset investment. The investment scale and targets set at the beginning of the year must not be relaxed and must not be exceeded; second, firmly controlling the rapid growth of the consumption fund. Banks and finance must continue to adhere to the policy of dual tightening, and do a good job in various tasks of increasing production and saving, increasing income and saving expenses, strictly controlling group purchasing power, and strengthening tax collection and administration. Measures must also be taken to effectively alleviate the problem of unequal distribution.

Regarding industrial production in the next few months, Li Peng said that the overall requirement is to neither slide nor have an appropriate growth rate. Relevant departments estimate that the industrial growth rate for the whole year will be around 10%. Achieving this rate is not low, and the key is to maintain long-term stable development and to reasonably adjust the industrial structure, product structure, and pay attention to the development of basic industries such as energy, transportation, and major raw materials. Currently, production enterprises are facing difficulties in funds, raw materials, and energy, especially some large key enterprises, which may face more difficulties. Therefore, production scheduling must be strengthened, and a certain tilt policy must be continued in funds, energy, and transportation to ensure the normal operation of key industries, key enterprises, and some key projects. Some funds must be allocated to solve the problem of mutual arrears among key enterprises.

Recently, many comrades from local and departmental units have asked: how should the various reform and opening-up measures implemented before the Fourth Plenum be viewed? Should they still be implemented? Li Peng replied that all rectification and adjustment and reform and opening-up measures that have been formally introduced before the Fourth Plenum, which have been discussed and decided by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, or the National People's Congress, and some of which have formulated regulations, laws, and even laws, must be continued to be implemented. Such as the "Enterprise Law" and its supporting regulations, local financial contracting, foreign trade and foreign exchange contracting, railway and coal industry contracting, and various contracting systems implemented by enterprises. Of course, problems reflected in the implementation process should be noted by all parties, and investigations and research should be carried out, experiences should be summarized, and situations should be reflected in a timely manner. In addition, for reform measures that have not been determined to be fully promoted in the past but are being piloted, piloting can still be carried out. At the same time, some new topics should be proposed for research.

Li Peng said that in the future, for any major reform measures to be introduced, there must be a scientific implementation plan, and they must go through piloting and do necessary publicity and publicity work, so that our reform can be carried out actively, steadily, and solidly.

Regarding the time and goals of the rectification and adjustment, Li Peng said that the State Council has decided to organize the drafting of a three-year rectification and adjustment plan, including this year, to clarify the specific goals to be achieved three years later. This plan will be submitted to the Central Committee for discussion and to the next session of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

Li Peng also analyzed the current international situation, saying that after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the anti-China wave launched by some Western countries, although it caused quite a stir internationally, is after all temporary and partial. The overall pattern of the world has not changed, and the world still faces the two major themes of peace and development. The basic trend of the international situation shifting from confrontation to dialogue and from tension to relaxation has not changed, and it is still possible for our country to create a relatively long period of peaceful international environment for the modernization drive. Of course, it should also be clearly seen that factors that may lead to tension and even war have not been eliminated, and the process of relaxation will be long-term and tortuous. Opposing hegemony and maintaining world peace will be a long-term struggle. We must have a full estimate of the anti-China wave, adhere to principles, and withstand pressure, but also see that this situation is temporary. As long as our country continues to adhere to the independent foreign policy of peace, continues reform and opening-up, the political situation is stable, and the economy is developing, we will definitely be able to overcome the temporary difficulties imposed on our country and play a due role in international affairs.

At today's meeting, Vice Chairman Gan Ziyu of the State Planning Commission, Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Director of the Price Bureau Cheng Zhiping, and Auditor-General Lu Peijian of the Audit Office spoke respectively.

The full meeting was presided over by Premier Li Peng. Vice Premiers Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun, Wu Xueqian, State Councilors Qin Jiwei, Zhou Jiaxuan, Li Guixian, Chen Xitong, Chen Junsheng, and heads of various departments and commissions of the State Council attended the meeting.

    李鹏总理在国务院全体会议上说
    年内经济工作重点仍是三件事
    继续稳定物价，争取农业好收成，缓解总供给总需求矛盾
    国务院决定组织起草三年治理整顿计划明确三年后目标
    新华社北京8月15日电　（记者陈芸、杨国钧）国务院总理李鹏今天在国务院全体会议上说，今年1至7月我国的经济形势是好的，发展比较平稳，今后几个月经济工作的重点仍然是三件事：即继续稳定物价，争取全年农业的好收成，缓解总供给与总需求的矛盾。
    今天的国务院全体会议，中心议题是通报经济情况，部署今后几个月工作。
    李鹏总理说，前7个月经济发展比较平稳主要表现在三个方面：一是避免了经济的大滑坡，保持了工业增长10.6％，没有发生有些人预言的经济滞胀的现象。二是平抑物价工作取得了成绩。今年上半年全国零售物价总水平比去年同期上涨25.5％，但其中因去年涨价影响到今年的占了18.5％，新涨价的部分只占7％，特别是“菜篮子”的物价比较稳定，甚至稳中有降，所以群众实际感受到的物价上涨幅度已低于去年，群众对此感到满意。三是农业生产形势比较好。夏粮总产达9355万吨，比去年增产257万吨，达到历史最高水平。目前秋季作物长势良好，虽然局部地区受灾严重，只要今后不出现大的灾情，可望今年全国农业生产会有一个好收成。
    李鹏说，从上半年情况看，改善总需求超过总供给的状况，完成的不够好。首先是压缩固定资产投资没有达到预期效果。今年计划全社会固定资产投资规模比去年压缩20％，实际上只做到与去年同期持平，也就是刚刚控制到没有再增长。其次是消费基金居高不下，增长速度还在20％以上，高于生产发展速度和国民收入、财政收入的增长速度。社会高消费和社会上分配不公的问题还没有缓解。在控制投资需求和消费需求方面还要做大量工作。
    对于下半年的经济工作，李鹏说，工作的重点是这三件事：继续稳定物价，争取全年农业的好收成，缓解总供给与总需求的矛盾。
    他重申，今后几个月工作的总的指导方针仍然是坚定不移地贯彻执行改革开放方针，理直气壮地抓好治理整顿，丝毫不能动摇。治理整顿与改革开放不是互相对立的，搞好治理整顿，目的是为改革开放创造更好的环境与条件，同时在治理整顿时期，一些改革开放的措施不但要继续执行，而且还要继续深化。
    关于稳定物价，李鹏说，今后几个月丝毫不允许有任何的松懈，要采取更为果断的措施，把控制物价工作做好。凡是属于国家管理的价格，未经国务院批准，谁也不准越权提价，违者必严惩不贷。属地方和企业自行管理的价格，也要严格把关和实行必要的申报制度，并广泛发动群众加以监督。李鹏说，今年以来，对零售物价指数，除用与去年同期比较和当年新增加部分的两种统计口径以外，又新增加了一种以47种城镇职工基本生活必需品和服务费用为对象的物价指数，从而把控制物价的重点放在稳定中等及中等以下收入的居民所需基本生活资料的价格上。从执行结果看，与去年12月相比，全国城镇基本生活资料价格平均上涨1.4％，明显低于去年的上涨幅度。
    李鹏强调，争取全年农业有个好收成，是稳定全局的大事。目前华北、山东等地区要抓紧做好抗旱工作。各级政府和有关部门一定要在农作物的中后期管理上、农用生产资料的供应上、收购资金的准备上以及产中产后的服务上做好工作，把丰收的希望变成现实。
    关于缓解总需求大于总供给的矛盾，李鹏说，主要抓两件事：一是继续坚决压缩固定资产投资规模，年初定下来的压缩指标和投资规模，不能开口子，不得突破；二是坚决控制消费基金的过快增长。银行和财政要继续坚持双紧的方针，切实做好增产节约、增收节支的各项工作，严格控制集团购买力，加强税收征管工作。还要采取措施，切实缓解分配不公的问题。
    谈到今后几个月的工业生产时，李鹏说，总的要求是既不要滑坡，又要有一个适当的增长速度。有关部门估计，全年的工业增长速度在10％左右。达到这个速度，已经不低，关键要保持长期稳定的发展，并在产业结构、产品结构上得到合理的调整，注意能源、交通、主要原材料等基础工业的发展。目前生产企业在资金、原材料和能源方面普遍遇到困难，特别是一些大型骨干企业，困难可能更多一些。因此，要继续加强生产调度，在资金、能源、运输等方面继续实行一定的倾斜政策，保证重点行业、重点企业和一些重点项目的正常进行。拿出一些资金解决重点企业的互相拖欠问题。
    最近，不少地方、部门的同志问：对以前实行的各项改革开放措施应当怎么看？是不是还继续执行？李鹏回答说，四中全会以前已经正式出台的各项治理整顿和改革开放的措施，凡是经过党中央、国务院或人大讨论决定的，有的还制定条例、法规甚至是法律的，都要继续贯彻执行。如《企业法》以及与之配套的条例，地方财政包干、外贸外汇包干、铁路和煤炭等行业包干以及企业实行的各种承包制度等。当然，在执行过程中反映出的一些问题，各方面要注意调查研究，总结经验，及时反映情况。此外，凡是过去没有确定全面推广而是进行试点的改革措施，还可以进行试点。同时还要提出一些新的题目加以研究。
    李鹏说，今后凡是大的改革措施出台前，都要有科学的实施方案，都要经过试点，还要做好必要的宣传舆论工作，使我们的改革既积极又稳妥地、扎扎实实地进行下去。
    关于治理整顿的时间和目标问题，李鹏说，国务院已决定，由计委牵头组织起草一个包括今年在内的3年治理整顿计划，明确3年以后我们要达到的具体目标。这个计划要提交中央全会讨论，并提交下次人大会议审议。
    李鹏还分析了当前的国际形势，他说，在平息北京发生的反革命暴乱后，一些西方国家掀起的反华浪潮，虽然在国际上引起不小的震动，但其影响毕竟是暂时的、局部的。整个世界的大格局并没有变化，世界面临的依然是和平与发展两大主题。国际形势从对抗转向对话，从紧张转向缓和的基本势态没有变，为我国四化建设争取一个较长时期的和平国际环境仍然是可能的。当然也应该清醒的看到，可能导致形势紧张甚至发生战争的因素并未消除，缓和的进程将是长期的和曲折的，反对霸权主义维护世界和平将是长期的斗争。我们既要对反华浪潮有充分的估计，坚持原则、顶住压力，又要看到这种局面是暂时的。只要我国一如既往地坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持改革开放，政局是稳定的、经济是发展的，我们就一定能够克服强加给我国的暂时的困难，在国际事务中发挥应有的作用。
    在今天的会议上，国家计委副主任甘子玉、农业部部长何康、物价局局长成致平、审计署审计长吕培俭分别发了言。
    全体会议由李鹏总理主持。国务院副总理姚依林、田纪云、吴学谦，国务委员秦基伟、邹家华、李贵鲜、陈希同、陈俊生以及国务院各部委的负责人出席了会议。
