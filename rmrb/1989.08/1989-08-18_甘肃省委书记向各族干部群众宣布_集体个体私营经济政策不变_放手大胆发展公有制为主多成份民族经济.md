Gansu Provincial Party Secretary Li Zichi recently announced during an investigation and research trip to Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture that the Party's policies on developing collective, individual, and private economies in minority areas remain unchanged; the provincial government's supportive policies for the economic and cultural development of minority areas remain unchanged; and the Party's policies on ethnic and religious affairs remain unchanged. He urged cadres and people of all ethnic groups to further emancipate their minds and boldly develop a multi-component ethnic economy with public ownership as the mainstay, based on the foundation of "one central task and two basic points."

Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, with a population of over 1.5 million, is home to multiple ethnic groups including the Hui, Dongxiang, Bao'an, Sala, Tibetan, Tu, and Han. Minority populations account for 53.8%. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party's various ethnic policies and the line of reform and opening up have enabled the various ethnic groups in this Muslim-populated area to live in harmony, maintain social stability, and develop their economies, particularly the individual and private sectors, rapidly. Many of the local ethnic industries with good economic benefits or under construction are privately invested and owned. In the previous period, due to the impact of turmoil and riots, some doubts arose among some cadres and the masses.

During his investigation and research, Li Zichi addressed the doubts among cadres and the masses by engaging in extensive discussions with officials, party members, the masses, and religious leaders at the prefecture, county, and township levels. He emphasized to everyone the importance of Deng Xiaoping's speeches and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, repeatedly stressing that the ethnic and economic policies that have been proven effective over the years will not change and need to be further improved and perfected in light of the specific circumstances of minority areas.

Li Zichi said that the practice of the past few years has proven that reform and opening up are particularly important for the prosperity and development of minority areas. In the future, the province will, while consolidating and developing the public economy, further relax policies to support minority areas in taking a path of economic development with ethnic characteristics. Especially for the individual and private Muslim economies that have already taken shape, they must be protected. The various ethnic groups should be assured that the Party's policy of hard work and prosperity will not change. In the future, under the premise of legal operation, efforts should be made to develop a multi-component ethnic economy and various construction projects with public ownership as the mainstay, as in the past.

    甘肃省委书记向各族干部群众宣布
    集体个体私营经济政策不变
    放手大胆发展公有制为主多成份民族经济
    据新华社兰州8月18日电（记者冯诚）甘肃省委书记李子奇最近在临夏回族自治州调查研究时向各族干部群众宣布，党对少数民族地区发展集体、个体和私营经济的各项政策不变；省上扶持少数民族地区经济文化发展的优惠政策不变；党的民族宗教政策不变。他要求各族干部群众在坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”的基础上，进一步解放思想，放心大胆地发展以公有制为主体的多种成份的民族经济。
    拥有150多万人口的临夏回族自治州，是回族、东乡族、保安族、撒拉族、藏族、土族、汉族等多民族聚居的地方，其中少数民族人口占53.8％。党的十一届三中全会以来的各项民族政策和改革开放路线，使这个穆斯林聚居区各民族和睦相处，社会安定，民族经济，特别是个体和私营经济得到迅速发展。一些经济效益较好的和正在动工兴建的地方民族工业大都是私人投资、私人所有。前一阶段，由于受动乱和暴乱的影响，在一部分干部、群众中引起了一些疑虑。
    李子奇在调查研究过程中，针对干部群众中的思想疑虑，与州、县、乡各级干部、党员、群众和宗教界上层人士进行广泛交谈对话，向大家宣讲邓小平同志重要讲话和四中全会精神，反复强调，这些年以来已被实践证明是行之有效的民族政策和经济政策不会改变，并要结合少数民族地区的特殊情况，进一步完善提高。
    李子奇说，这几年的实践证明，改革开放，对少数民族地区的繁荣发展尤为重要。今后，省上要在巩固和发展公有经济的同时，进一步放宽政策，支持少数民族地区走具有民族特色的经济发展路子。特别是对已经初具规模的穆斯林个体和私营经济，一定要予以保护。要让各族群众放心，党的勤劳致富的政策不会改变。今后，应在依法经营的前提下，放开手脚，一如既往，努力发展以公有制为主体的多种成份的民族经济和各项建设事业。
