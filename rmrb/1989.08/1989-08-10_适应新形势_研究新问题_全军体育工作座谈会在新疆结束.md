The full military sports work conference concluded in Xinjiang yesterday. The conference, organized by the General Political Department's Cultural Department, discussed how to adapt military sports work to the new situation of military construction and national sports development, and how to maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of mass activities and sports teams.

In recent years, with the progress of reform and opening up, sports are no longer just a recreational activity for soldiers but are increasingly becoming a cultural form deeply integrated into military life. On one hand, sports to enhance combat effectiveness remain the primary purpose of military sports activities. Various training and competition activities are organized at the grassroots level of the military, and sports facilities are built and improved across the entire military to focus on improving soldiers' physical fitness. On the other hand, the military has realized that in this new development period, sports are not just a means of entertainment but have become, to some extent, an important part of soldiers' lives. Sports, with their unique concepts and forms, are expanding the soldiers' lives and thoughts.

The conference also studied the construction of military sports teams.

Deputy Director Ju Li of the General Political Department's Cultural Department spoke at the meeting, calling on all military sports workers to boost their spirits and strive for higher achievements.

Military sports workers from various military regions and military branches participated in this conference.

    适应新形势　研究新问题
    全军体育工作座谈会在新疆结束
    本报乌鲁木齐8月10日电　记者温子建报道：部队体育工作如何适应军队建设和国家体育事业发展的新形势？如何保持和发扬群体活动和体工队的光荣传统？由总政文化部主持召开、于昨天在这里闭幕的全军体育工作座谈会讨论了上述问题。
    近年来，随着改革开放的进行，体育不再仅仅作为战士们的业余消遣活动，而是愈来愈以一种文化形态深入到部队生活之中。一方面体育出战斗力仍然是部队体育活动的首要宗旨，在部队基层广泛组织各种锻炼和竞赛活动，在全军范围内建设完善体育活动场所，着重提高战士的身体素质；另一方面，部队意识到新的发展时期，体育已经不仅只是娱乐手段，而是在某种程度上成为战士生活的重要内容。体育以它特有的观念和形态开拓着战士们的生活与思想领域。
    这次座谈会还研究了部队体育队伍的建设问题。
    解放军总政文化部朱力副部长在会上讲话，要求全军体育工作者振奋精神，攀登高峰。
    解放军各军区各军兵种的体育工作者参加了本次座谈会。
