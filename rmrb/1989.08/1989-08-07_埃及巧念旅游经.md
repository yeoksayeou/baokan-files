Title: Egypt's Clever Tourism Strategy

Thousands of miles away in Egypt, how could one not visit the Pyramids! However, starting from next January 1st, if you plan to walk up to the magnificent Great Pyramid of Giza, touch the Sphinx, and take a photo with this marvel of human civilization, you will need to pay 3 dollars first. If you also want to visit the solar boat that the pharaohs used to ascend to heaven, that will cost an additional 10 dollars.

The Egyptian Antiquities Organization today made this regulation without hesitation. There's no need to calculate in detail; from free admission to a 3-dollar ticket, the Pyramids will bring in a significant amount of money for Egypt's tourism industry. Foreign tourists have already spent a lot of money, so why not spend a little more on this ticket? It's understandable. After all, the Pyramids are in Egypt.

What's impressive is that Egypt's tourism industry indeed has a knack for making money.

The Pyramids and ancient Egyptian civilization are money trees, of course. But how to maximize their use to make money is an art. A 3-dollar ticket not only controls the number of tourists visiting the Pyramid area, reducing regular damage, but also raises foreign exchange funds for maintaining and developing this tourist hotspot. The brilliance lies in the fact that this price is neither too expensive for foreign tourists to complain about, making them willing to accept being "ripped off," nor does it actually make Egypt profitable.

It is reported that Egypt's tourism revenue in 1988 has already exceeded 2 billion dollars. The average stay of foreign tourists has increased from 5.8 nights to 9.2 nights. The reporter has noticed that the secrets can be summarized into three points: expanding tourist sources; extending stay duration; and inducing increased consumption. Charging for visiting the Pyramids is probably also one of these strategies.

There are other new tactics as well. Those who have been to Cairo know that the giant statue of Pharaoh Ramses II from the 19th Dynasty of ancient Egypt is erected in front of the railway station square, surrounded by bustling traffic, and no one pays attention to this mighty king with his glorious military achievements. The polluted air has corroded the once shiny surface of the statue, making it pitted and uneven. Tourism experts can no longer bear to see the pharaoh idle, so they plan to move him. Look at the clever idea: if placed in the new location, tourists at most need to buy a ticket to visit; but if placed in the Nile River, tourists not only need to buy a ticket but also a boat ticket to board the artificial island in the river to pay their respects, which would collect double the money! For this, experts held academic discussions, arguing from various angles. Some papers even linked the relocation of Ramses II with the bed occupancy rate of 120 hotels in Cairo, truly meticulous.

Some people might not agree, thinking this is just a minor trick. However, it is precisely these meticulously calculated "minor tricks," combined with the all-out promotion by tourism agencies, the eloquent guides, and the enthusiastic service of the shop assistants at Khan el-Khalili, that make foreign tourists reluctant to leave, making Egypt's tourism industry particularly thriving.

    埃及巧念旅游经
    本报记者　林皎明
    千里迢迢来埃及，哪能不看金字塔！
    可从明年1月1日起，您如果打算走到雄伟的胡夫金字塔跟前，用手摸一摸狮身人面像，再与叹为观止的人类文明奇迹拍一张合影，那么，请先交3美元。还想瞻仰法老升天乘的太阳船？好，再付10美元。
    埃及古迹管理委员会今天毫不迟疑地做出上述规定。用不着细算，从免费参观到看一看3美元，金字塔又为埃及旅游业吃进一大笔款子。外国游客什么钱都花了，难道还在乎这张门票？认了。谁让金字塔建在埃及呢。
    令人折服的是，埃及旅游业确实招财有术。
    金字塔和古代埃及文明是摇钱树，这当然没说的。但如何最大程度地利用它招财进宝，却是一门学问。3美元的门票，不仅控制了金字塔地区的游客人数，减少常规损坏，而且筹集了维护和开拓这一旅游热点的外汇资金。妙就妙在这一定价既不让外国游客嫌贵哇哇叫，甘心认“宰”，又确实使埃及有利可图。
    据悉，埃及1988年旅游收入已经突破20亿美元。外国游客平均滞留时间从5.8夜猛增到9.2夜。记者留心日常报道，把其诀窍归纳为3点：广开游客来源；延长滞留时间；诱导增加消费。参观金字塔收费，恐怕也算一项。
    还有别的新招。到过开罗的人都知道，古埃及19王朝法老拉姆西斯二世的巨大出土雕像被矗立在火车站站前广场上，四周车水马龙，没人留意那位有赫赫战功的君王。污浊的空气已把光亮的雕像表面腐蚀得坑坑洼洼。旅游专家再不忍心让法老闲呆着，准备给他搬搬家。你看主意有多妙：立在新址，游客至多买张门票就能参观；可要是立在尼罗河里，游客不仅要买门票，还要再买一张船票，才能登上河中人工岛瞻仰，这岂不收双份钱？为此，专家们召开学术讨论会，多方论证。有的论文甚至把拉姆西斯二世搬家与开罗120家旅游旅馆床位利用率联系起来，真可谓精到家了。
    有人可能不以为然，认为这是雕虫小技。然而，正是这些精打细算的“小技”，配合着旅游代理商无孔不入的宣传、能说会道的导游前后忙乎、汉哈利利商店伙计的热情服务，才使外国游客流连忘返，把埃及旅游业闹得格外红火。（本报开罗8月7日电）
