Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 31st.

A survey conducted by social science institutions in the German Democratic Republic indicates that the average life expectancy of citizens in the GDR has increased. Currently, the average life expectancy for male citizens in the GDR is 69 years, and for female citizens, it is 75 years.

The primary reason for the increase in the average life expectancy of citizens is the decline in the birth rate since 1972.

The population of the German Democratic Republic in 1988 was 16.67 million, ranking 43rd in the world and 9th in Europe. Male citizens account for 48% of the population, while female citizens account for 52%.
