Reflecting on the Bitter Fruit
— A Q&A on Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization in Publishing

Director of the Press and Publication Administration, Song Muwen

Q: The recent turmoil and rioting had profound and significant causes, one of which was the long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization thought, which confused people's minds. How has bourgeois liberalization manifested in the publishing industry, and how can we change this situation?

A: This intense political struggle has given us much to think about, deeply, profoundly, and heavily. The publishing field, as an important ideological front, has seen several waves of bourgeois liberalization, and it has been getting worse. Promoting liberalization views has become a hot topic, and those who promote liberalization have become "trendy figures." The majority of the publishing workforce is good or relatively good, but it is undeniable that there are a few who fear not providing a platform for these "trendy liberalization figures." The publishing industry should reflect and awaken, gaining new understanding and a new attitude.

Q: Over the past decade, the publishing industry has made significant strides and achieved notable successes. Will reflecting on and opposing bourgeois liberalization erase the achievements of the publishing industry?

A: There is no such issue. Just as the problems in the publishing industry do not erase its achievements, the achievements of the publishing industry do not cover up its problems. Currently, reviewing the past and considering the future from the perspective of existing problems, especially the problem of bourgeois liberalization, is more necessary, more meaningful, and more effective in grasping the essence of the problem. Because the essence of the bourgeois liberalization political trend is to deny the socialist system, deny the leadership of the Communist Party, advocate for the capitalist system, and clarify this point, it can help us understand its political essence and avoid treating general bourgeois theoretical views as political bourgeois liberalization. Distinguishing between different levels of problems is both practical and easier for people to accept.

Fully Recognizing the Serious Harm of Liberalization Thought

Q: First, we should focus on studying the manifestations, development, and harm caused by bourgeois liberalization thought in the publishing field, right?

A: Yes. Practice has shown that the struggle against bourgeois liberalization is an important battlefield in the publishing field, and the twists and turns of this struggle will be prominently reflected here. From the books and periodicals we have reviewed, we can draw the following impressions: a few years ago, the main focus was on promoting that China lacks capitalism and needs to "catch up," which later developed into directly advocating for capitalism and calling for the capitalist spirit in China; a few years ago, the main focus was on promoting that Chinese socialism has feudal characteristics, which later developed into specifically denying public ownership, planned economy, and distribution according to work, which are the essential characteristics of socialism; a few years ago, the focus was on generally denying Chinese cultural traditions, which later developed into completely denying the new culture since the May Fourth Movement and calling for bourgeois "blue culture"; a few years ago, the focus was on distorting the history of a certain period after the founding of the nation, which later developed into distorting and vilifying the entire revolutionary history from the new democratic revolution to socialism, completely denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China; a few years ago, the focus was on distorting certain historical events in the international communist movement, which later developed into completely denying the entire international communist movement; a few years ago, the focus was on abstract calls for democracy, freedom, and humanism, which later developed into directly slandering and attacking the people's democratic dictatorship; a few years ago, the focus was on distorting, denying, and attacking certain points of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which later developed into completely denying the general principles and revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, essentially denying the guiding significance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. And so on. For many years, this kind of public opinion has been rampant. This has created a very dangerous situation and environment in the ideological field. From this, we can clearly see that the essence of bourgeois liberalization is indeed in sharp contrast to the four cardinal principles, aiming to subvert our People's Republic, and the harm is enormous.

We Must Not Introduce Western Culture Without Criticism

Q: Previously, you mentioned different levels of problems. What are they mainly referring to?

A: This refers to the introduction of Western bourgeois theoretical views without selection or criticism, which is actually the promotion of bourgeois worldviews, political views, historical views, artistic views, ethical views, and value views. Some people even became "new-style figures" by vigorously promoting these ideas. These bourgeois theoretical views are different from political bourgeois liberalization, and the policies and methods to address them are also different. However, we must also see the connection between the two, that is, these theoretical views are the ideological basis for the spread of bourgeois liberalization thought, and correctly addressing this issue is undoubtedly an important condition for eliminating liberalization thought. Of course, we do not simply deny Western culture. Western culture can also provide nourishment for the development of our own culture. Opening up to the outside world includes absorbing foreign cultural achievements to develop and prosper socialist culture. This work must continue. We must use Marxist views to make selections, analyses, evaluations, and transformations. But the main problem at present is still as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee: "Regarding various philosophical, economic, socio-political, and literary and artistic trends from the West, without analysis, without discrimination, without criticism, but blindly and enthusiastically promoting them." This situation, "can no longer be tolerated." According to Comrade Xiaoping's speech, we have taken action several times, but just like opposing bourgeois liberalization, we have not been able to maintain consistency, making it impossible to stop the spread of these foreign influences, which have instead become more rampant. To implement Comrade Xiaoping's instructions, we are currently conducting in-depth research on this major issue and will soon propose rectification and management measures.

We Must Not Allow Low-Level and Vulgar Publications to Spread

Q: In recent years, the market has been flooded with low-level, vulgar, and superstitious publications, and there have been many opinions from all sides.

A: This is precisely the third situation that needs to be emphasized. Not only have low-level, vulgar, absurd, and superstitious publications become rampant, but there have even been some obscene, pornographic, and violent publications. These publications corrupt people's will, degrade their morals, cause them to lose ideals and aspirations, and are particularly harmful to young people. This is completely at odds with the socialist nature and the socialist spiritual civilization advocated by our party. Some old comrades have suggested that these publications should be burned like opium. The direct cause of the rampant spread of these "spiritual opium" is the commodification of spiritual products, where, for the sake of profit, low tastes are catered to, professional ethics are ignored, and social responsibility is disregarded. Some people have even degenerated into greedy speculators, eagerly peddling these filthy spiritual opium. For these people, the so-called "forced into prostitution" is just an excuse; in reality, they are quite conscious of their actions. "You have policies, and I have countermeasures." To make big money, they find ways to exploit policy loopholes, play on the edge of the rules, do things that are close to violating regulations, laws, and prohibitions, and yet avoid being caught, making it difficult for you to ban them. In a previous period, even criticizing "everything for money" was not mentioned, as if a spiritual production unit could be unscrupulous. Of course, the deepest cause of the rampant spread of these evil things is the spread of bourgeois liberalization thought. Because those who promote bourgeois liberalization, their political advocacy is to establish a capitalist system; their theoretical advocacy is the series of bourgeois doctrines they spread, and in terms of moral character and spiritual demeanor, they are also generally compatible with such low-level and vulgar things. Just as establishing a capitalist system in China can only make China degenerate into a subordinate, second-rate bourgeois republic, establishing a bourgeois culture in China will inevitably spread that kind of subordinate, decadent, and low-level cultural form, rather than the rising and flourishing periods of bourgeois culture. The publishing front must be in the hands of Marxists

Q: Should we now completely change this situation?

A: It takes more than a day to freeze three feet of ice. A situation that has formed over many years cannot be reversed overnight, and truly solving the problem from the depths of thought requires hard work. If in the past we lacked the conditions or did not have the conditions to solve these problems, now the situation has changed. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has established a new central leadership that can truly uphold one central task and two basic points. The evil consequences of bourgeois liberalization are being recognized by more and more people. Striving to strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and consistently opposing bourgeois liberalization have become the urgent common demand of the entire party, which has created favorable conditions for us to solve the problems that have not been solved for a long time. We must seize this favorable opportunity to reverse the situation of bourgeois liberalization and various decadent thoughts in the publishing field, actively organize and produce high-quality and colorful socialist spiritual products. We must have the resolve and courage, just as we want to make up for the economic losses caused by the turmoil and riots, we must also take back the publishing front that has been lost.

Q: What measures are currently being prepared?

A: To implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, we are currently conducting rectification of the book, newspaper, and audio-visual markets, banning all illegal, reactionary, politically erroneous, and pornographic, violent, and feudal superstitious publications, and quickly reversing the intolerable chaotic situation; at the same time, we must thoroughly solve the source of pollution, vigorously rectify newspapers and publishing units, and carry out necessary reductions. However, more fundamentally and long-term, we must study the relevant documents and speeches of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and currently, we must focus on solving three aspects of the problem:

1. Study the theory of the primary stage of socialism, fully recognize the long-term, arduous, and complex nature of opposing bourgeois liberalization, and truly be prepared in thought.
2. Further understand the nature, status, and role of publishing work in socialist construction, especially the need to strengthen the understanding of "publishing work in socialism is first and foremost propaganda and education work."
3. Better adhere to one central task and two basic points, and in the process of reform and opening up, pay special attention to upholding the socialist direction. Some problems that have arisen in publishing reform, including the issue of the two benefits, can be more clearly seen when considered from the perspective of direction. These are all for improving the ideological construction of the publishing team. At the same time, organizational construction is also needed. Through practice, especially the current political struggle practice, we will assess cadres and, based on the actual situation, make necessary adjustments and supplements to some leading cadres, so that the leading cadres at all levels become cadres who firmly implement the central line, truly taking the publishing front into the hands of Marxists. This is the fundamental guarantee for the publishing work to adhere to the socialist direction.

Q: People often say that authors, publishers, and readers form a complete chain in the publishing industry. To change the face of the publishing industry, the efforts of all parties are needed.

A: That is a requirement from the perspective of the whole society, which is necessary for the thorough improvement of the publishing industry. To use an analogy, publishing is like a "processing plant" and a "launching pad," subject to the producers of the products; at the same time, the consumers of the products also influence the publishing industry. Therefore, to thoroughly reverse the situation of the publishing industry, comprehensive governance is also needed. Therefore, we hope that theorists, artists, and translators will be more loyal to their duties and produce high-quality spiritual products; we hope that the broad readership and critics will put forward stricter requirements and more active suggestions for the publishing industry. We must also solve the economic policies that are conducive to the healthy development of the publishing industry. However, the key is to start with ourselves. In this sense, we require publishing workers to improve their awareness, be loyal to their duties, and like a goalkeeper on a soccer field, not let the opposing side score a goal.

For many years, bourgeois liberalization thought and various decadent thoughts have infiltrated and occupied a considerable number of publishing fronts, which is unprecedented in the history of our republic. This is almost unimaginable, yet it is the reality we face. This is a bitter pill, and we have to swallow it! But what we must prevent is: after swallowing the bitter pill, forgetting the lesson.

    吞下苦果后的思考
    ——关于在出版工作中反对资产阶级自由化的问答
    新闻出版署署长　宋木文
    问：刚刚过去的这场动乱和暴乱，很深刻很重要的原因，是资产阶级自由化思潮的长期泛滥，把人们的思想搞乱了。资产阶级自由化思潮在出版方面有哪些表现？如何改变这种状况？
    答：这场惊心动魄的政治斗争，让人思考的东西实在太多、太深刻、太沉重了。出版领域作为意识形态的一个重要阵地，资产阶级自由化思潮在这里几次泛滥，而且越来越厉害。宣传自由化观点成为热门话题，宣传自由化的人物成为“时髦人物”。出版队伍的大多数是好的、比较好的，但也不可否认，确有少数人，生怕不能给那些自由化的“时髦人物”提供阵地。出版界应该反思和猛醒，应该有一个新的认识、新的姿态。
    问：10年来，出版事业有了大的发展，成绩比较突出。就反对资产阶级自由化问题进行思考和反思，不会抹杀出版界所取得的成就吧？
    答：不存在这个问题。正如出版界所存在的问题不能抹杀所取得的成就一样，出版界所取得的成就也不能掩盖所存在的问题。在当前，从存在问题特别是从资产阶级自由化问题的角度回顾过去，思考未来，更有必要，更有积极意义，更能抓住问题的实质。因为资产阶级自由化这种政治思潮的实质是否定社会主义制度，否定共产党的领导，主张资本主义制度，明确了这一点，能帮助我们认识其政治实质，又可以避免将一般的资产阶级理论观点看作是政治上的资产阶级自由化。将不同层次的问题分开，既符合实际情况，又易于为人们所接受。
  充分认识自由化思潮的严重危害
    问：首先还是要注意研究资产阶级自由化思潮在出版领域的表现、发展及其所造成的危害吧？
    答：是这样。实践表明，反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，一个重要战场是以报刊和图书构成的出版阵地，斗争的曲折和发展变化也会在这里突出地表现出来。从我们查阅的部分图书报刊中就可以得出这样一些印象：前些年较突出的还是宣传中国缺少资本主义，需要“补课”，后来发展到直接宣扬资本主义，呼唤资本主义精神，在中国实行资本主义；前些年较多的还是宣传中国的社会主义有封建主义印记，后来发展到具体否定公有制、计划经济和按劳分配等社会主义的本质特征；前些年还是一般地否定中国的文化传统，后来发展到彻底否定“五四”以来的新文化，呼唤资产阶级的“蓝色文化”；前些年还是丑化建国以后某一阶段的历史，后来发展到歪曲、丑化从新民主主义到社会主义的整个革命历史，彻底否定中国共产党的领导；前些年还是歪曲国际共产主义运动的某些历史事件，后来发展到全盘否定整个国际共产主义运动；前些年还是某些抽象的民主自由、人道主义的呼唤，后来发展到直接诽谤和攻击人民民主专政；前些年对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想主要还是歪曲、否定、攻击某些论点，后来发展到全盘否定马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的一般原则和革命灵魂，实际上是否定了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导意义。如此等等。多少年来，就是这种舆论甚嚣尘上。这就在意识形态领域造成了一种很险恶的态势和环境。由此可以清楚地看到资产阶级自由化的实质的确是与四项基本原则尖锐对立的，是企图颠覆我们人民共和国的政治思潮，危害极大。
    不能不加批判地介绍西方文化
    问：前面提到有不同层次的问题，主要指什么？
    答：这是指同资产阶级自由化思潮相呼应，不加选择、不加批判地对于西方资产阶级思想理论的介绍，实际上是宣传资产阶级的世界观、政治观、历史观、艺术观、伦理观、价值观。有些人甚至因大力贩卖这些东西成了“新派人物”。这种资产阶级的思想理论观点，同政治上的资产阶级自由化是有区别的，解决的政策和方法也是不同的。但是也要看到两者之间的联系，即这些理论观点是资产阶级自由化思潮得以泛滥的思想理论依据，因而正确地解决这个问题无疑是消除自由化思潮的重要条件。当然，我们并不简单地否定西方文化，西方文化也可以为发展我们自己的文化提供营养。对外开放，其中就包括吸收外来文化成果，以发展繁荣社会主义文化。这方面的工作，还要继续做好。要用马克思主义的观点去进行选择、分析、评价和转化。但目前的主要问题，仍如邓小平同志在十二届二中全会上所指出的：“对于西方各种哲学的、经济学的、社会政治的和文学艺术的思潮，不分析、不鉴别、不批判，而是一窝蜂地盲目推崇。”这种状况，“再也不能容忍了”。根据小平同志的讲话精神，我们曾经抓过几次，但也同反对资产阶级自由化一样未能坚持一贯，使这种外来品的泛滥不但未能刹住，反而愈演愈烈。为贯彻小平同志的指示，我们正在就这一重大问题专门进行研究，尽快提出整顿治理的措施。
    不许低级庸俗出版物泛滥成灾
    问：近几年来，市场上充斥着低级庸俗、荒诞迷信的出版物，各方面的意见也很大。
    答：这正是需要着重指出的第三种情况。不只是低级、庸俗、荒诞、迷信的出版物泛滥成灾，甚至出现了一些淫秽、色情和宣扬凶杀暴力的出版物。这些出版物腐蚀人们的意志，败坏人们的情操，使人们丧失理想和追求，对青少年毒害更大。这是和社会主义性质、和我们党所倡导的社会主义精神文明完全对立、格格不入的。一些老同志提出，要像烧鸦片一样统统烧掉的，就是这类出版物。这类“精神鸦片”泛滥的直接原因，是精神产品商品化的结果，为了赚钱，不惜迎合低级趣味，不讲职业道德，不讲社会责任。有些人甚至堕落成唯利是图的投机商，起劲地兜售那些污七八糟的精神鸦片。对这种人来说，所谓“逼良为娼”，只是一种借口，实际上干得相当自觉。“你有政策，我有对策”。为了赚大钱，想方设法钻政策的空子，“打擦边球”，做那些接近犯规、犯禁、犯法的事，又不让你抓住，使你查禁不了。前一个时期，连批评“一切向钱看”都不提了，似乎一个精神生产单位可以见利忘义。当然，造成这些丑恶东西泛滥成灾的最深刻原因，还是资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥。因为搞资产阶级自由化的人，其政治主张是建立资本主义制度；其理论主张是其散布的一系列资产阶级学说，表现在道德情操、精神风貌上，也大体上是与这样一些低级庸俗的东西相适应的文化。正如在中国建立资本主义制度只能是使中国蜕变成一个附庸的、二等的资产阶级共和国一样，在中国建立资产阶级的文化也必然泛滥着那种附庸的、没落的、低级的文化形态，而不是上升时期和鼎盛时期的资产阶级文化。出版阵地应掌握在马克思主义者手中
    问：现在应该彻底改变这种局面了吧？
    答：冰冻三尺非一日之寒。多年形成的局面自然不能一下扭转，真正从思想深处解决问题，更要做艰苦的工作。如果说过去不具备或缺少解决这些问题的条件，那么现在发生了变化。十三届四中全会确立了能够真正坚持一个中心、两个基本点的新的中央领导班子，资产阶级自由化造成的恶果被越来越多的人所认识，大力加强社会主义精神文明建设和坚持一贯地反对资产阶级自由化已成为全党普遍的迫切要求，这就为我们解决过去长期没有解决的问题创造了有利条件。我们要抓住这个有利时机，扭转资产阶级自由化和各种腐朽思想在出版领域泛滥的状况，积极组织和生产高质量的丰富多彩的社会主义精神产品。要有这样一种决心和魄力，正像我们要把动乱、暴乱造成的经济损失夺回来一样，更要把丢失的那些出版阵地夺回来。
    问：当前准备采取哪些措施？
    答：为贯彻十三届四中全会精神，当前正在进行书报刊和音像市场的整顿，取缔各种非法的、反动的、有严重政治错误的、宣传色情、暴力和封建迷信的出版物，尽快扭转令人难以容忍的混乱局面；同时要彻底解决污染源问题，大力整顿报刊和出版单位，并进行必要的压缩。但是，更带根本性、长远性的，还是要学好党中央和邓小平同志关于坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的有关文件和论述，当前要着重解决好三个方面的问题：
      （一）学习社会主义初级阶段的理论，充分认识反对资产阶级自由化的长期性、难巨性、复杂性，真正从思想上做到常备不懈。（二）进一步认识出版工作在社会主义建设中的性质、地位和作用，特别需要加强关于“社会主义出版工作首先是宣传教育工作”的认识。（三）更好地坚持一个中心、两个基本点，在改革开放中，要特别注意端正社会主义方向。出版改革中出现的一些问题，包括两个效益的问题，提高到方向的高度去考虑，就容易看得清楚。这都是为提高出版队伍所需要的思想建设。同时还要进行组织建设。要通过实践，特别是当前这场政治斗争的实践考核干部，根据实际情况对一些领导班子进行必要的充实和调整，使各级领导班子成为坚决执行中央路线的领导班子，真正将出版阵地掌握在马克思主义者手中。这是出版工作得以坚持社会主义方向的根本保证。
    问：人们常说，作者、出版者、读者使出版业构成了一个完整的链条，要想改变出版界的面貌，需要各方面的共同努力。
    答：那是从全社会的角度提要求，是出版业彻底好转所必需的。打个比喻说，出版是个“加工厂”、“发射台”，受制于产品的制造者；同时，产品的消费者也影响出版业。所以，彻底扭转出版业的状况，也需综合治理。因此我们希望理论家、文艺家、翻译家们更加忠于职守，生产一些高质量的精神产品；希望广大读者，还有评论家们，对出版界提出更严格的要求，更积极的建议。还要解决有利于出版事业健康发展的经济政策。但是，重要的是从自己做起。正是在这种意义上，我们要求出版工作者提高认识，忠于职守，就像足球场上的守门员，不要再让敌对的一方踢进球来。
    多年来，资产阶级自由化思潮和各种腐朽思想侵蚀、占据着为数不少的出版阵地，这在我们共和国的历史上是前所未有的。这几乎难以设想，又不能不是我们面对的现实，这是一个苦果，这个苦果我们只能吞下去！但要防止的是：吞下了苦果，忘记了教训。
