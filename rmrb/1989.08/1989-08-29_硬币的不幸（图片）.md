Title: The Misfortune of Coins

I aimed my camera at the coins scattered among the lotus leaves in the pond a few meters away, feeling a heavy heart. Those metallic coins gleamed brightly under the sunlight, yet they pierced my heart!

These coins, fortunate enough to be scattered among the lotuses like stars in a summer night sky, reveal the varied attitudes of those who threw them: were they tossed for amusement, or thrown for divination? Little do they know, such actions waste so many national resources and damage so many coins. If the coins bearing the national emblem could speak, they would surely mock the ignorance of those who threw them!

Please, fellow citizens, cherish our coins!

    硬币的不幸
    我怀着抑郁的心情，将照相机向池塘里数米远处的睡莲丛中星星点点的一分、二分、五分硬币对焦。那金属硬币在阳光下，是那样的耀眼，又那样的刺心！
    这些有幸散落在池中睡莲上像夏夜繁星的硬币，展现了投币人的种种心态：是掷币取乐，还是投币问卜？殊不知，此举浪费了多少国家资源，损坏了多少硬币。如果镌铸有国徽的硬币有知，定会鄙笑投掷者的愚昧！
    请公民们爱护硬币！
