The medical conditions in the rural areas of Bamboo Mountain are truly poor. Due to the weak economy in my region's Bamboo Mountain County, the mountain people face significant difficulties in preventing and treating diseases. Currently, out of the 25 township health centers in the county, 23 do not have oxygen equipment, 14 cannot perform X-rays or routine blood tests, and 13 cannot conduct electrocardiograms or ultrasound examinations. Many of the existing equipment was purchased in 1966. In recent years, college graduates assigned to the area have found ways to move to the cities. In recent years, college graduates from outside the area have not been assigned here, and local graduates are unwilling to return. Now, out of the 25 health centers, only 2 have bachelor's degrees. A large number of staff are untrained. According to statistics, there are 567 people in the Bamboo Mountain County health system without professional qualifications, accounting for 51% of the total number of employees, resulting in low medical quality.

    竹山农村医疗条件真差
    我地区所辖的竹山县，由于经济薄弱，山区人民防病治病有很大困难。目前，全县25个乡镇卫生院，23个没有氧气设备，14个不能作透视和常规血液化验，13个不能作心电图、超声波。现有设备许多还是1966年购置的。前些年分配来的大学生都找门路飞往城市。近几年，外地大学生分不来，本地大学生也不愿回。现在，25个卫生院仅有2名本科生。大量是未经培训的人员。据统计，竹山县卫生系统中，无专业学历的达567人，占职工总数的51％，以致医疗质量不高。
