Enchanting Deer Village

Not long ago, we visited Lushu Town in Shuangyang County, Jilin. The brick and tile courtyards and the lively groups of sika deer left us with unforgettable memories. The farmers here have moved beyond single-crop farming, expanding both the breadth and depth of their production. Raising deer and harvesting their antlers not only increases their income but also adds endless joy to the lives of the people of Deer Village.

    迷人的鹿乡
    不久前的一天，我们来到吉林双阳县鹿乡镇，那一幢幢砖瓦结构的庭院、一群群活蹦乱跳的梅花鹿，令人留连忘返。这里的农民，结束了单一经营的生产方式，向生产的广度和深度进军。养鹿收茸既为他们增加了收入，又为鹿乡人的生活增添了无穷的乐趣。
