Under the deterrent of the "Two Courts and One Bureau" notice, an Anhui bureau-level official surrendered with illicit gains.

Our reporter Zhang Zhiguo reports from Hefei: On the morning of August 25, Liu Yushan, former deputy director of the Anhui Provincial Machinery Bureau, surrendered to the provincial supervisory bureau with 47,600 yuan in bank savings certificates.

According to Liu's confession, he used methods such as filling out false invoices and falsely claiming reimbursements from more than 10 enterprises under the bureau to embezzle over 30,000 yuan in public funds. Liu also stated that he would continue to confess his crimes and expose others. The case has been transferred to the procuratorial organs, and after all of Liu's criminal facts are investigated, he will be given lenient treatment in accordance with the law.
