In the next decade, West Germany will gradually transport 4,000 tons of nuclear waste to a factory in northern Britain for reprocessing. According to the contract signed by the two countries, the uranium and other materials extracted from the nuclear waste will be returned to West Germany, while the by-products will belong to Britain. The remaining waste will stay in Britain, for which West Germany will pay Britain 1.6 billion pounds (approximately $2.6 billion).

For Britain, which is facing a tight economic situation, this is a lucrative deal, so Prime Minister Thatcher is fully supportive. However, British environmental protection groups are outraged. A representative from the Greenpeace organization said, "We are becoming the world's nuclear waste dump. Thousands of tons of spent but still highly radioactive fuel will be transported in and out of our country until the next century. We will be stuck with this fate."

Originally, West Germany planned to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant in Bavaria, but due to domestic opposition, the plan was scrapped. It then put out a tender in France and Britain, and the British Nuclear Fuels company won the bid. Last year, this company had already processed nuclear waste for countries such as Spain, Italy, Japan, and West Germany, earning 400 million pounds.

The British government's decision also faces opposition from the House of Commons and the people in the regions designated for nuclear waste storage. The British Nuclear Fuels company had to launch a publicity campaign to explain the safety measures it will take, including digging several tunnels hundreds of meters deep underground to store nuclear waste. However, according to nuclear experts, even if the nuclear waste is buried deep underground, it will take more than 100,000 years for its radioactivity to weaken to an absolutely safe level.

    英国的核废料风波
    陈封
    在未来的10余年内，西德将分批把4000吨核废料运往英国北部的一家工厂进行再处理。根据两国签订的合同，从核废料中提炼出来的铀等运回西德，其他副产品则归英国所有，提炼后剩下的一切残料留在英国，西德为此将付给英国16亿英镑（约26亿美元）的报酬。
    对于经济形势吃紧的英国来说，这是一笔颇有油水的交易，所以首相撒切尔夫人全力支持。但是，英国的环境保护团体却大为愤怒。“绿色和平”组织的一位负责人说：“我们变成了世界的核垃圾桶了。数千吨已用过但仍具有高放射性的燃料将在我国运进运出，直到下个世纪。我们将陷入这种命运。”
    西德原计划在巴伐利亚建造一座核废料再处理工厂，但由于受到国内反对而将计划取消。它于是在法国和英国招标承办这项工作，结果英国核燃料公司中标。去年这家公司就曾为西班牙、意大利、日本和西德等国的核废料进行过加工，赚了4亿英镑。
    英国政府的决定还受到国会下议院和预定堆存核废料地区人民的反对。英国核燃料公司不得不发动一场宣传运动，解释该公司将采取的安全措施，包括开掘若干距地面数百米深的坑道来储藏核废渣。但据核专家说，即或将核废渣深埋地下，要使其放射性减弱到绝对安全程度，需要经过10万年以上。
