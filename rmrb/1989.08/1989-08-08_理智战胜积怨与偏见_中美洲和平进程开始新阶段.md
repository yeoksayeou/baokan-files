In the year 1502, Columbus embarked on his fourth voyage, reaching the Atlantic coast of Central America today. The turbulent waves tossed the fleet to the crest, then plunged it into the abyss. When the fleet finally escaped the danger and safely landed, Columbus, relieved, said, "Thank God, we have emerged from Honduras (the abyss)." This abyssal country is today's Honduras.

Coincidentally, the summit of the five Central American countries held in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, also found itself in the "Honduras" (abyss). After many twists and turns, it finally turned danger into safety, reaching an agreement to disband the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces within 90 days. As Honduras President Azcona put it, the results of the meeting were "satisfactory to all, although everyone felt exhausted." From this point on, the Central American peace process will enter a new phase due to the end of the war in Nicaragua.

This summit was held on the second anniversary of the second Esquipulas (Central American Peace Agreement). According to the decisions of the previous meeting, the five countries should have formulated a joint plan to disband the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces at this meeting. Because this is the first specific action plan since the peace process began two years ago, it has been full of twists and turns. From the perspective of internal obstacles within Central America, there are mainly three: first, the Salvadoran government proposed at the preparatory meeting of the vice-ministers of foreign affairs to formulate a joint plan to "simultaneously disband" the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces and the Salvadoran guerrillas; second, the disagreement between Nicaragua and Honduras on whether to set a deadline for disbandment; third, Honduras demanded that Nicaragua immediately and unconditionally withdraw its lawsuit against Honduras at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. From the perspective of external obstacles, the United States repeatedly demanded that the disbandment of the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces be postponed until after the Nicaraguan elections in February next year. Therefore, the situation of the meeting was never optimistic. The debate continued until the start of the summit without a conclusion. Subsequently, under the opposition of the four presidents, El Salvador had to abandon its so-called "simultaneous disbandment" motion, and only in the disbandment plan passed by the meeting, a separate chapter was listed for the disbandment of the Salvadoran guerrillas and other informal armed forces in the region to show concern. However, the latter two "obstacles" almost caused the summit to "fail." Due to the stubbornness of both Nicaragua and Honduras, the meeting reached an impasse. The meeting the next day was held all night, and the presidents were indeed exhausted. Costa Rican President Arias said to reporters this morning before the resumption of the meeting: "Central America cannot go against the historical trend; because the whole world is moving towards democracy and peace. 'In the hands of the five presidents lies the fate of 24 million people in Central America. I believe that we will ultimately reach a historic agreement, pushing the Central American peace process forward.' The meeting, originally scheduled to end in the morning, continued into the afternoon. Finally, reason conquered grievances and prejudices, and all parties adjusted their positions, reaching an understanding and agreement on the last two major issues, creating a historic opportunity to end the war in Nicaragua and strive for peace in Central America.

The agreement reached by the five Central American countries is not accidental; it is the inevitable result of the Central American peace process over the past two years. Over the past two years, each summit has experienced twists and turns, but finally sought common ground while reserving differences. Each time, through consultations and compromises among the relevant parties, some agreements or understandings were reached, and some progress was made. Because the people of Central America demand an end to years of war, this is something that the will of any superpower cannot suppress. Secondly, the Nicaraguan government reached a broad political agreement with various parties at home before the summit, which surprised the presidents of various countries. Nicaragua was in a strong position at this summit. The disbandment plan passed by the five countries pointed out that, "considering the democratic progress made by the political agreement between the Nicaraguan government and various parties," it "possesses the conditions needed to repatriate anti-government armed personnel," which proves this point. Another factor is that from the end of this year to the beginning of next year, except for El Salvador, the other countries will face elections and changes of government. The presidents who initiated the Central American peace process do not want to see their years of efforts go to waste and hope to achieve something. However, the agreement of the five presidents does not equal reality. Whether the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces will stop and turn swords into plowshares is still a concern. However, it can be affirmed that, due to the Central American and global public opinion being on the side of the peace cause, the war in Nicaragua will one day come to an end.

    理智战胜积怨与偏见
    ——中美洲和平进程开始新阶段
    本报记者　郭伟成
    公元1502年，哥伦布进行第4次远航，到达了今天中美洲的大西洋沿海。惊涛骇浪时而把船队抛到浪尖，时而坠入渊底。当船队终于脱离险境，安全靠岸时，哥伦布如释重负地说：“感谢上帝，我们走出了洪都拉斯（深渊）。”这个深渊之国，就是今天的洪都拉斯。
    事有凑巧，在洪都拉斯首都特拉举行的中美洲5国首脑会议也曾陷在“洪都拉斯”（深渊）里，经过一波三折，终于转“危”为安，达成了90天内遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装的协议。用洪都拉斯总统阿斯科纳的话说，会议结果是“各方满意的，尽管大家都感到筋疲力尽”。至此，中美洲和平进程将由于尼加拉瓜结束战争而开始进入一个新的阶段。
    这次首脑会议是在第二个埃斯基普拉斯（中美洲和平协议）两周年之际召开的。根据上次会议的决定，5国应当在这次会上制订出一个遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装的共同计划。由于这是和平进程开始两年来的第一个具体行动计划，因此，前后充满曲折。从中美洲内部面临的障碍来说，主要有三个：一是萨尔瓦多政府在会前副外长预备会上提出制订共同计划，“同时遣散”尼反政府武装与萨尔瓦多游击队；二是尼、洪两国在是否规定遣散期限上的分歧；三是洪要求尼立即无条件撤销在海牙国际法庭对洪的起诉。从外部障碍来说，美国一再要求把尼加拉瓜反政府武装的遣散推迟到明年2月尼加拉瓜大选以后。因此，会议形势始终不能令人乐观。争论一直到首脑会议开始仍未有分晓。之后在4国总统的反对下，萨尔瓦多不得不放弃了所谓“同时遣散”的动议，只是在会议通过的遣散计划中对萨尔瓦多游击队和本地区其它非正式武装的遣散单列一章，以示重视。但是，后两个“障碍”却差点使首脑会议“砸锅”。由于尼、洪双方各执一词，相持不下，会议一度形成僵局。第二天的会议通宵进行，总统们确实已筋疲力尽。哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯在今天上午复会前对记者们说：“中美洲不能违背历史潮流；因为全世界都朝向民主与和平。”“在5位总统的手里，掌握着中美洲2400万人民的命运。我相信，我们最终会取得一个历史意义的协议，把中美洲和平进程推进一步。”原定上午结束的会议，延续到下午。终于，理智战胜了积怨与偏见，各方调整了立场，一举在最后两个重大问题上达成谅解与协议，为结束尼加拉瓜战争、争取中美洲和平创造了一个历史性的机会。
    中美洲5国达成协议并不是偶然的，这是中美洲和平进程两年来的必然结果。两年来，每一次首脑会议都经历曲折，但终于求同存异，每次都以有关各方的协商与妥协，达成一些协议或理解，取得一些进展。因为中美洲人民要求结束多年的战乱，这是任何超级大国的意志都无法压抑的。其次，尼加拉瓜政府在首脑会议前夕，与国内各党派达成广泛的政治协议，使各国首脑“大吃一惊”，尼加拉瓜在这次首脑会议上处于有力的地位。5国通过的遣散计划中指出，“考虑到尼加拉瓜政府与各党派政治协议取得的民主化进步”，“具备了遣返反政府武装人员需要的条件”证明了这一点。另外一个因素是，从今年底到明年初，除萨尔瓦多，其他各国都面临大选换届，开创中美洲和平进程的各位总统，谁也不愿意使多年的努力前功尽弃，希望有所成就。但是，5国总统协议并不等于现实。尼加拉瓜反政府武装是否就此洗手不干，铸剑为犁，还可堪忧。但是可以肯定，由于中美洲及世界舆论在和平事业一边，因此尼加拉瓜的战争总有一天是要结束的。（本报特拉8月7日电）
