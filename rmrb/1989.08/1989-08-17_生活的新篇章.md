As a worker in the field of ethnic minority economics, I have traveled to many ethnic minority regions, interacting with cadres and the masses in cities, towns, agricultural areas, and pastoral regions. We have discussed tea, cotton, grain, forestry, electricity, coal, and iron, shared our thoughts, sketched out blueprints, listened to their opinions and suggestions, and shared their joys and happiness. Together, we have danced to the sound of the reed flute in the style of the Miao people and sung praises to the grasslands with the horsehead fiddle. Everywhere I have gone, I have seen the blossoming of economic prosperity and the fruits of ethnic unity and progress, which have deeply inspired me.

Those ordinary people, those mundane events, and those commonplace scenes often sparkle with brilliant flashes before my eyes.

In the 1960s, during the most difficult times, when even grass roots and tree bark were used to fill stomachs, and every family feared adding another mouth to feed, a couple of herdsmen on the Xilingol Grassland opened their generous hearts and successively adopted eight "ugly ducklings"—Han orphan children sent from the inland regions. They carried them in their arms, on their shoulders, on their backs, and on their horses, nurturing them into talents. They became soldiers, cadres, and doctors, transforming into the proud "white swans" of the grassland. What these couple gave was not just sympathy and pity. No, they gave the great love of parents and the deep affection of ethnic unity.

One unforgettable autumn, I visited a Hui village in Ningxia—a place that a friend had described to me as extraordinarily poor. However, I was astonished: every household had red brick houses, and some even had polished stone floors. Under the eaves, strings of bright red chili peppers hung, and on the walls, there were quotes from Muhammad: "Do not take unjust wealth, and prosper through labor." On the roofs and in the courtyards, there were piles of rice. In a Muslim family, a girl who drove a tractor and wore a red polyester satin shirt told me, "In the past, our village was so poor. Once, a sent-down youth brought a clock from the city, and I and my friends didn't know what it was. Even more pitifully, we were so old, and some of us were still naked. At that time, a bride wearing a white shirt was as honored as wearing a dragon robe. Now, who cares about white shirts! Look, we usually wear 'Waves Without Wind' and 'Shivering'." She laughed and casually got onto the tractor. As the tractor started, she turned on a cassette player she carried with her, and the beautiful melody of "In the Field of Hope" immediately echoed through the courtyard and the village. Her father said, "Don't look at this girl, she's crazy, but she's more capable than a boy." He added, "This place has changed so quickly, first because of the policy, and second because of the water. The irrigation station brought the Yellow River water to our doorstep." Listening to this old man's words and watching the girl's figure disappear on the road, I always felt that there was a flame burning and leaping before my eyes...

A 76-year-old Mongolian old woman's pursuit can be said to embody the spirit of the nation.

She is a descendant of slaves and has never been to school. Her most vivid childhood memory is of begging for food and being chased by vicious dogs. After getting married, she was always anxious, fearing that someone would come to collect debts. Then there was giving birth to children. Although she gave her children a string of auspicious names: Lai Fu, Man Cang, Man Tun, these children did not bring fortune or full granaries to the family. Some even died young from illness and hunger. She was once a depressed, oppressed, and thoughtful rural woman who had never been anywhere. In the year the country was founded, she was 36 years old. Now, at 76, she is a well-known farmer-poet in the area, having published over 30 poems and articles. At the age of 74, she fulfilled her lifelong wish by traveling thousands of miles to Beijing to study at a senior citizens' university. This year, after receiving her bachelor's degree from the senior citizens' university, she sat in the classroom of an advanced studies program. She said, "My real age is the same as the Republic. The first 36 years of my life were wasted." As for how she participated in literacy campaigns, how she taught herself, how she created in the midst of production labor, and how she fought against disease (she had her ribs crushed by a cart and suffered from intestinal cancer), that should be left to the authors of reportage literature.

For some reason, I thought of the Yellow River, the mother of the Chinese nation, and her series of large power stations, the Longyangxia, Liujiaxia, and Qingtongxia, with their scenes of bustling lights. And from this, I thought of the 56 ethnic groups as 56 brilliant pearls adorning the body of our motherland, aren't they!

    生活的新篇章
    杨帆（蒙古族）
    作为民族经济工作者，我到过许多少数民族地区，接触过城市、乡村、农区、牧区的各族干部和群众，和他们共话茶菜棉粮、林电煤铁，和他们畅叙情怀，描绘蓝图，倾听他们的意见和建议，分享他们的喜悦和欢欣，和他们一起踏着芦笛跳起苗族舞蹈，和着马头琴唱起草原赞歌。足迹所到，随处可见的经济繁荣之花，民族团结进步之果，使我深深为之鼓舞。
    那些极普通的人，极平凡的事，极寻常的场景，常常迸出绚丽的火花在我的眼前闪烁。
    60年代，在最困难的时期，草根树皮都成了充饥品，家家都怕添人加口的情况下，锡林郭勒草原上的一对牧民夫妇，却敞开他们博大的胸怀，陆续收养了8只“丑小鸭”——从内地送来的汉族孤儿。他们怀里抱着，肩上扛着，背上背着，马上驮着，把他们一个个抚养成才，成了军人、干部和医生，变成草原上骄傲的“白天鹅”。这对夫妇奉献的难道仅仅是同情怜悯？不，他们奉献的是伟大的父母之爱，深厚的民族之情。
    一个难忘的金秋，我来到宁夏一个回族山村——一个熟人曾向我介绍过的穷得出奇的地方。然而，我却惊愕了：家家一色的红砖房，有的人家还是水磨石地板。屋檐下，一色地挂满了鲜红鲜红的辣椒。墙上，一色地贴着穆罕默德圣训：不取不义之财，靠劳动发家。房顶上、院子里晾的是一色的稻谷。在一个穆斯林家里，一位开拖拉机的穿红色涤丝绸衬衫的姑娘对我说：“过去，俺这坎儿可穷了，村里有一次一个知青从城里带回一个闹钟，我和我的伙伴都不认得那是啥玩艺，更可怜的是，我们都那么大了，有的还赤身裸体的。那时候，结婚的新娘子穿一件的确白（良）衬衣，就像穿了龙袍一样荣耀。现在，谁还稀罕的确良！看，我们平常都穿的是“无风起浪”、“哆哩哆嗦”了。说完，她笑着，潇洒地跨上拖拉机，在拖拉机启动的同时，她打开了随身带的收录机，《在希望的田野上》那优美旋律立刻回荡在小院、山村。她父亲说：“别看这丫头疯，比小子还能干呢”，又说“这坎儿变得这么快，一是有了政策，二是有了水，扬水站把黄河的水送到门口来了。”我听着这位老汉的话，望着那姑娘消失在大路上的身影，一直感到眼前有一团火在燃烧，在跳跃……
    一位76岁的蒙古族老额吉（母亲）的追求可以说是民族精神的体现。
    她是奴隶的后代，世世代代目不识丁。童年留给她的最深刻的记忆就是讨饭时被恶狗追赶。成家后终日惴惴不安，害怕人家登门逼债。再就是生孩子，虽然给孩子们取了一串吉祥的名字：来福、满仓、满囤，然而，这些孩子既没给家里带来福气，也没带来满仓满囤的粮食，有的反而病饿夭折。她曾是个忧郁压抑、充满思虑的农村妇女，哪儿也没去过。建国那年，她36岁，如今她76岁，是当地小有名气的农民诗人，发表过30多篇（首）诗文。并且在74岁的时候，实现了她一生的夙愿，千里迢迢来到北京上老年大学学习深造。今年，她拿到了老年大学本科的毕业文凭之后，又坐进了研究班的教室。她说：“我真正的年龄和共和国同岁，解放前那36年，白活”。至于她怎样参加扫盲、怎样自学成才，怎样在生产劳动中产生创作灵感，怎样与病魔作斗争（她被马车轧断过肋骨，患过肠癌），那应该留给报告文学作者。
    不知为什么，我由此想到了孕育中华民族的黄河母亲，想起她那一连串的大电站，龙羊峡、刘家峡、青铜峡那一片喧腾万家灯火的景象，并由此想到，56个民族就是缀在祖国母亲身上的56颗璀璨的明珠，不是么！
