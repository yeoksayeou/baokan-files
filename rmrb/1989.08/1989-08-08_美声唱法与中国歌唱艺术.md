Vocal art is the study of language extended in musical melodies. Due to differences in languages, pronunciation organs, and vocal techniques among various countries, regions, and ethnic groups, singing methods, vocal characteristics, and performance styles also differ. In terms of "singing method," the orthodox singing method of the Chinese vocal school should be recognized as "Chinese Bel Canto." However, this method has not been acknowledged in China's music community.

The Chinese people are not accustomed to referring to vocal genres and schools as "singing methods," but rather use terms like Peking Opera, Henan Opera, Yue Opera, Qin Opera, Huangmei Opera, Sichuan Opera, Bangzi, Erhuang, folk songs, and Flower Songs to describe "singing methods." Although China has many vocal genres, they all share a common requirement in vocal training: the voice must possess qualities of resonance, sweetness, crispness, brightness, fluidity, and beauty, akin to metallic tones. Ancient China has stories of Qin Qing's voice that could "shake the trees and stop the clouds," and Han E's voice that had "resonating echoes for three days." Therefore, if we are to label a "singing method," "Bel Canto" is the most accurate term for the Chinese vocal school.

Some people say that the "Bel Canto" category in recent singing competitions in China refers to "Chinese Bel Canto." This is incorrect. The "Bel Canto" category in these competitions actually refers to the imported Italian singing method, which emerged in the late 16th century during the European Renaissance. This art form evolved from ancient Roman papal music and biblical chanting methods, so in the 1950s, the Chinese vocal community referred to it as the "Western traditional singing method." Italian and Chinese Mandarin are two different languages. The vowels (vowel sounds) and pronunciation techniques in "Western" languages cannot be compared to those in the Chinese language. Different languages necessitate different singing methods. The vocal image of "Chinese Bel Canto" is more solid, brighter, more concentrated, higher in pitch, and more penetrating than that of the "Western traditional singing method." It emphasizes the mouth as the leading organ, with the front and back of the mouth working together to define the positions of biting, spitting, moving, and retracting. The vocal sound is more authentic, with greater contrast between brightness and darkness, and stronger and weaker extensions. It has a broader adaptability and plasticity for performing various songs. The training methods of "Chinese Bel Canto" fundamentally prevent the "oral resonance" and "vocal wrapping" issues that "Western traditional singing method" singers often encounter when performing Chinese art songs.

Since "Chinese Bel Canto" has not been recognized and established in past singing competitions, singers of this method sometimes have to compete in the so-called "Bel Canto" category. They should sing traditional Italian art songs or Western opera arias, but instead, they inappropriately choose to sing Chinese art songs like "Yellow River Lament," "I Love You, China," and "Motherland, Benevolent Mother" for the competition. This has led to conceptual confusion and a lack of coherence.

Some people believe that "Chinese Bel Canto" is included within the "folk singing method." I disagree. The "folk singing method" in these competitions should refer to the unique singing styles of various ethnic groups or regions in China, while "Chinese Bel Canto" is a singing method that inherits Chinese vocal traditions and also borrows from "Western" singing techniques, not belonging to any specific ethnic group or region.

Cultural arts must first have national characteristics before they can have global appeal. Any singing method that can be appreciated by people around the world must first be a national singing method. For Chinese vocal art to stand on the world stage, we must establish and develop our own national vocal school. Since the founding of the nation, a large number of singers belonging to the "Chinese Bel Canto" method have emerged, such as Li Shuangjiang, Jiang Jiatang, Jiang Dawei, Peng Liyuan, Dong Wenhua, and Yan Weiwen. However, for a long time, the "attributes" of their singing methods have been quite ambiguous, making it difficult for many performers and works to be accurately categorized in competitions. Audiences often find them to be "neither here nor there" (Bel Canto, folk, popular), or fitting in anywhere. I believe that once "Chinese Bel Canto" is established, these confusions can be resolved, or at least there will be a guideline to follow.

    美声唱法与中国歌唱艺术
    王宝璋
    歌唱艺术是研究语言在音乐旋律上延长的艺术。由于各个国家、地区、民族的语言不同，咬字发音器官运用的部位不同，所以歌唱发音方法、嗓音的特色、演唱的风格也就不同。以“唱法”而论，我们中华民族声乐学派的正统唱法，应认定为“中国美声唱法”。但这一唱法在我国音乐界却一直未被确认。
    我国人民对声乐门类、流派不太习惯称“唱法”，而是称京剧、豫剧、越剧、秦腔、黄梅戏、川剧、梆子、二黄、民歌、花儿等来说明“唱法”。我国声乐派别剧种虽多，但就嗓音训练，均有一个共同的要求，这就是要具备响、甜、脆、亮、水、美的金属般膛音成份。古代我国就流传有秦青的歌喉能“声振林木，响遏行云”，韩娥的嗓音有“余音绕梁，三日不绝”的故事。所以若论“唱法”，用“美声”来标志我中华民族声乐学派最为确切。
    有人说，我国近年来举办的一些“大奖赛”中所设的“美声唱法”，就是“中国美声唱法”，这种说法是不正确的。“大奖赛”所设的“美声唱法”实际是指外来的意大利唱法，此艺术形式是十六世纪末，在欧洲文艺复兴时期诞生的，因为它是从古罗马教皇音乐及咏唱圣经的歌唱方法延续发展至今，所以50年代我国声乐界称其为
  “西洋传统唱法”。意大利语言和我国汉语普通话是两种不同的语言。“西洋”语言中的韵母（元音）及其发音技法部位的运用，是无法与汉语语言相比的。语言不同，歌唱发音方法也必然不同。“中国美声唱法”的声音形象，比“西洋传统唱法”的嗓音要更结实、更明亮、更集中，位置更高，穿透力更强。以前嘴为主导，前、后嘴协力的说机能咬、吐、走、收的定位能力更鲜明，语音更真切，嗓音的亮暗反差、强弱伸缩幅度更大，演唱曲目的适应性、可塑性更广，更强。“中国美声唱法”的训练方法，从根本上防治了“西洋传统唱法”歌手在演唱中国艺术歌曲时，常常会出现的“口腔音”、“声包字”。
    由于“中国美声唱法”在以往的“大奖赛”中，未被组织者确认设立，使得这种唱法的歌手有时只得栖身在所谓“美声唱法”组的比赛中。本应选唱意大利传统艺术歌曲或西洋歌剧选曲，却又不恰当地选唱《黄河怨》、《我爱你中国》、《祖国，慈祥的母亲》等中国艺术歌曲参赛。导致了概念的混乱，也显得不伦不类。
    也有人认为，“中国美声唱法”包括在“民族民间唱法”之内，笔者不敢苟同。因为“大奖赛”所设“民族民间唱法”，应该是指我国各个民族或各个地方的各自独具风格的演唱方法，而“中国美声唱法”则是继承了我国民族声乐传统，又借鉴了“西洋”歌唱手段的一种歌唱方法，不属于某个民族或地区。
    文化艺术，首先要有其民族性，而后才可能有其世界性。凡是能被世界各国人民所喜爱的歌唱方法，必定首先是一个国家的民族唱法。我国声乐艺术要立于世界歌坛之林，必须建立和发展自己的民族声乐学派。建国以来，曾涌现了一大批属于“中国美声唱法”的歌唱家，如李双江、姜嘉锵、蒋大为、彭丽媛、董文华、阎维文等。然而在相当长的时间里，他们的唱法“属性”是极为含混的，使许多演员和作品在比赛中总是无法界定准确的领域，听众听起来也感到“三不像”（美声、民族民间、通俗），或者放在哪里都还可以。我以为，在确立了“中国美声唱法”后，这类困惑便能迎刃而解，或起码能有所遵循了。
