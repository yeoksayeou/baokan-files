State-owned assets have suffered severe erosion in recent years. According to estimates, from 1984 to 1988, the difference between the replacement value and the original value of state-owned assets reached 386 billion yuan, averaging over 700 billion yuan annually in compensation shortfalls.

Under the current system, a portion of the inflated profits is remitted to the treasury in the form of income tax and profits, thereby being used by society for public consumption. Another portion remains within the enterprise as retained earnings, with about 80% of this used to increase individual and collective welfare for employees.

The existing stock of state-owned assets would take over 40 years to be updated. To address the need for fixed asset compensation and updates, the state has implemented a classification depreciation method and appropriately increased the depreciation rate in recent years. However, the current depreciation rate is only around 5%, which is still too low. The depreciation funds extracted by state-owned enterprises amount to over 40 billion yuan annually. If this scale is maintained, it will take over 40 years to update the stock of state-owned assets.

The investment returns on new state-owned assets are far from ideal. According to investigations by relevant departments into the actual effects of 235 large and medium-sized projects completed between 1984 and 1986, only 61 projects achieved or exceeded their designed production capacity. Forty-six projects incurred losses after starting production, with a loss rate of 19.6%. According to incomplete statistics on 80 projects, the loss and waste amounted to 1.62 billion yuan, accounting for 4.6%.

A significant amount of state-owned assets has been lost during enterprise reforms. In the transfer of state-owned assets in state-owned industrial enterprises, the state has conceded too much, resulting in enormous losses.

The erosion of state-owned assets in Sino-foreign joint ventures is also a concern.

Additionally, during contract-based management, due to low contract bases, pre-tax debt repayment, and profit-sharing without loss-sharing, the "legal" loss of state-owned assets is widespread.

    国有资产权益遭侵蚀严重
    国有资产补偿不足额平均每年达700亿元。据估算，自1984年至1988年间，国有资产的重置价格与原值之间的差额已达3860亿元，平均每年形成补偿不足额达700多亿元。
    国有资产存量一年有700多亿元转化为消费基金。在现行体制下，虚增利润的一部分以所得税和利润形式上缴财政，从而被社会用于公共消费；另一部分则以企业留利形式留在企业，其中80％左右被用于增加职工个人及集体福利。
    现有国有资产需要40多年才能更新。为了解决固定资产补偿和更新的需要，国家曾于近几年对其实行了分类折旧办法，并适当提高了折旧率。但现行折旧率只有5％左右，仍然偏低。我国国营企业提取的折旧基金每年只有400多亿元，如按此规模计算，国有资产存量需40多年才能更新。
    新增国有资产投资效益很不理想。据有关部门对1984年至1986年之间建成的235个大中型项目的实际效果的调查发现，生产能力达到或超过设计水平的只有61个，有46个项目投产以后发生亏损，亏损面达19.6％。据对80个项目的不完全统计，损失浪费开支达16.2亿元，占4.6％。
    国有资产在企业改革中大量流失。在国营工业企业国有资产的转让中，国家让利过多，损失巨大。
    中外合资企业中，国有资产被侵蚀的状况也不容忽视。
    此外，在承包中因承包基数低、税前还贷和包盈不包亏等原因而引致的国有资产的“合法”流失现象比比皆是。
