Bilozertsev Expelled from Soviet Gymnastics Team

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 3rd: According to foreign news reports, the *Soviet Sports* newspaper reported on the 2nd that Olympic gold medalist and famous Soviet male gymnast Bilozertsev and his teammate Gogoradze were expelled from the Soviet national team preparing for the World Championships for drinking and carousing for two days.

Soviet gymnastics officials said, "Their behavior has corrupted other teammates." The *Soviet Sports* newspaper stated, "For our sports community, this is a typical case, which almost does not need any further explanation or comment."

Bilozertsev was previously known for his drinking. In 1985, he had a car accident after drinking, resulting in a fractured leg. Last year, after recovering from his injury, he returned to the sports arena and continued to achieve remarkable results. In the men's gymnastics competition at the Seoul Olympics, he scored six perfect tens and won three gold medals and a bronze medal in the all-around.

The *Soviet Sports* newspaper said that before the Seoul Olympics, Bilozertsev was almost expelled for drinking. However, Soviet sports officials, in order to achieve the goal of a comprehensive victory for the Soviet team, continued to keep him in the team. The newspaper sarcastically remarked, "For us, the luster of the gold medal overshadowed the fate of an individual."

    比洛泽尔采夫被苏体操队除名
    新华社北京8月3日电  据外电报道，《苏联体育报》2日说，奥运会3枚金牌得主、苏联著名男子体操选手比洛泽尔采夫和其队友戈戈拉德泽因酗酒作乐两天，被准备参加世界锦标赛的苏联国家队除名。
    苏联体操界领导人说：“他们的行为毒害了其他队友。”《苏联体育报》则说：“对于我们体育界来说这是一个典型事例，这几乎不需要再作任何的解释和评论。”
    比洛泽尔采夫以前就以酗酒出名。1985年他饮酒之后发生车祸而造成腿部骨折。去年，他伤愈后重返体坛，依然成绩辉煌，在汉城奥运会男子体操赛中，获得6个满分并夺得3枚金牌和全能铜牌。
    《苏联体育报》说，比洛泽尔采夫在汉城奥运会前夕就因为酗酒而差点被开除。但是苏联体育界官员为了实现苏联队全面胜利的目标而继续把他留在了队里。这家报纸不无辛辣地说：“对我们来说，金牌的光彩盖过了一个人的命运。”
