Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, August 17th.

The reporter learned from the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau that after the Huangdao oil depot was struck by lightning and exploded, at least 600 tons of crude oil flowed into the sea, causing oil pollution in Jiaozhou Bay. Currently, relevant departments are organizing personnel to clean up the spill.

The Huangdao oil depot is located on a hillside near the sea in Huangdao's Ying Mountain. At around 10 AM on the 12th, the No. 5 oil tank was struck by lightning and exploded, causing a large amount of crude oil to spill out. Later, several other oil tanks also exploded and leaked oil. Some of the spilled oil on the ground flowed into the sea. Most of the oil that flowed into the sea entered Jiaozhou Bay, with a small amount entering the Yellow Sea.

According to monitoring by the Qingdao Environmental Monitoring Station, the smoke from the burning oil tanks reached a blackness level of 5 on the Ringelmann scale. Due to the predominantly northerly winds in recent days, most of the smoke from the burning oil was blown towards the southern sea, having little impact on the air quality in the Qingdao urban area.

    黄岛油污殃及胶州湾
    600多吨原油流入大海  有关部门正组织清污
    新华社青岛8月17日电（记者刘海民）记者从青岛市环境保护局了解到，黄岛油库遭雷击爆炸后，估计至少有600多吨原油流进海里，胶州湾受到了原油污染。目前，有关部门正在组织人员清污。
    黄岛油库位于离海很近的黄岛莹山的半山坡上。12日上午10点左右，5号油罐遭雷击爆炸后，便有大量原油溢出，后来其他几个油罐也发生了爆炸溢油。外溢到地面的原油中的一部分流入了海中。流入海中的原油绝大部分进入了胶州湾，也有少量进入了黄海海域。
    另据青岛市环境监测站的监测，油罐燃烧时，黄岛上空的烟尘黑度林格曼达到5级以上。由于近几天主要是偏北风，所以原油燃烧后产生的烟尘大部分刮向了南部海面，对青岛市区大气环境影响不大。
