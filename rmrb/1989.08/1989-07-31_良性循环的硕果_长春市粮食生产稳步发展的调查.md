Over the past decade, the grain production in Changchun City, Jilin Province, has been continuously developing at an average annual growth rate of 10.65%. Last year, the city's total grain output ranked first among large and medium-sized cities nationwide, with an average grain possession of 9,690 kilograms per agricultural population.

Such outstanding achievements are, of course, related to the favorable natural conditions here: located in the heart of the Songliao Plain, the 15 counties (cities) under its jurisdiction are all designated national corn export bases and commercial grain bases. However, more importantly, it is due to the concerted efforts of the entire city. Over the past 10 years, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have not only remained steadfast in the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation but have also insisted on increasing reasonable investment in agriculture as a key measure. At present, a virtuous investment mechanism has been preliminarily established, driving the rapid development of agriculture and grain production.

	Farmers' Self-Investment as the Mainstay

Over the past 10 years, Changchun City has invested a total of 4.718 billion yuan (including labor accumulation converted into cash) in grain production, with an average investment of 329 yuan per mu. To ensure that the investment in grain fields increases year by year and that grain production develops steadily, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have actively guided the vast number of rural cadres and masses to overcome the dependence on state loans for grain production, gradually opening up all-round, multi-channel investment avenues, and striving to match state investment with local investment, collective investment with farmers' self-investment, and gradually making farmers' self-investment the mainstay.

	(1) Correctly guiding the direction of funds, turning farmers' consumption funds into production funds. From 1978 to 1986, the city's farmers raised 400 million to 500 million yuan annually, and in the past two years, this has increased to 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion yuan, accounting for 24% of agricultural production costs. On average, each farming household raises more than 150 yuan, and each mu of land raises about 10 yuan.

	(2) Establishing a production cost reserve fund system to guarantee the amount of farmers' self-raised funds. The municipal government decided that each mu of land should reserve 10-15 yuan of production funds annually, and when new grain is stored, a portion of the farmers' grain sales proceeds should be set aside and deposited in the bank, managed by the village, and used specifically for purchasing production materials.

	(3) Establishing cooperative fund associations to activate collective accumulated funds. They converted the collective accumulated funds before the household contract responsibility system into shares per household, established cooperative fund associations in towns and townships, and gradually expanded the share capital, implementing democratic management as a turnover fund for expanded reproduction. Currently, the city's cooperative fund associations have a total of 1.6 billion yuan in funds.

	(4) Increasing the proportion of local financial funds for agriculture. From 1978 to 1988, the municipal and county-level local finances allocated a total of 2.8 billion yuan for agriculture. In 1987 and 1988, the municipal finance also allocated 200 million US dollars annually from foreign exchange dividends to purchase imported phosphate fertilizer for farmers. At the same time, they shifted the focus of agricultural credit funds to grain production. The city's annual net agricultural credit investment is 3.2 billion to 3.5 billion yuan, with 80% used for grain production.

	(5) Implementing a mutual compensation policy of labor for funds and funds for labor, and actively promoting labor investment. The city stipulates that each labor force should contribute 15-20 days of voluntary labor annually for agricultural basic construction. Those who cannot work due to reasons should compensate with funds. From 1978 to 1988, the city accumulated 1.16 billion labor days, equivalent to 6 billion yuan, mobilizing 3.5 billion cubic meters of earthwork, reinforcing and strengthening 1,500 kilometers of river embankments and 19 large and medium-sized reservoirs within the jurisdiction, and improving 3.6 million mu of waterlogged land. This has enhanced the ability to resist natural disasters and created good conditions for achieving a bumper grain harvest.

	Fertilizer and Technology as Key Points

During the grain production process, Changchun City has always focused on fertilizer input as a major link. On the one hand, they rationally increase the application of chemical fertilizers, and on the other hand, they pay great attention to the accumulation and application of farmyard manure, and regard it as a fundamental measure to ensure the long-term stable development of grain production. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have formulated a land conservation system, stipulating that each hectare of paddy and dry land should apply not less than 20 cubic meters of high-quality farmyard manure annually. Each year, the task of accumulating manure is assigned to each township, and the municipal and county governments organize relevant departments to inspect in sections, and link the amount and quality of manure accumulation with the salaries and bonuses of township and village cadres. For households that fail to complete the task of accumulating and applying manure, they are required to pay land conservation funds, thereby mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm for accumulating farmyard manure. In 1988, the city applied 840,000 standard tons of chemical fertilizers and accumulated 28.8 million cubic meters of high-quality farmyard manure, increasing by 105% and 150% respectively compared to 1987.

Changchun City has always regarded scientific and technological input as a strategic measure in agricultural production, relying on science and technology to tap potential and increase grain production through science and technology. In recent years, they have conducted short-term training for township and village cadres in a tiered and disciplinary manner to popularize agricultural scientific knowledge; they have focused on grain production, promoted standardized cultivation techniques for corn, rice, and soybeans, optimized formula fertilization techniques, and adopted comprehensive scientific and technological measures to transform medium and low-yield fields, using rice greenhouse seedling raising and standardized dry seedling raising and other 10 new technologies.

	Scientific Investment for High Efficiency

The principle of Changchun City's grain production investment is to center on improving economic benefits, implement scientific investment, invest heavily in high returns, invest moderately in moderate returns, and not invest in no returns, organically combining farmers' wealth and producing more grain for the country. To achieve higher economic benefits, they first conduct thorough investigations and research on major projects with large investment amounts and wide coverage, invite experts and scholars for scientific demonstration, and formulate investment plans. The city's medium and low-yield fields account for 80% of the cultivated land area. To increase effective investment in this part of the land, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, through organizing relevant departments and personnel to conduct investigations and demonstrations, carried out large-scale agricultural basic construction, adopting the engineering measures of "low-lying land as paddy fields, flat land as dry land, barren land for flue-cured tobacco, and saline-alkali land for sugar crops" in combination with biological measures. They have now transformed 30% of the medium and low-yield fields, achieving significant yield-increasing effects.

    良性循环的硕果
    ——长春市粮食生产稳步发展的调查
    新华社通讯员　孙吕郑　新华社记者  张开欣
    近10年来，吉林省长春市的粮食生产以年均增长10.65％的速度持续发展，去年粮食总产量名列全国大中城市榜首，全市农业人口人均占有粮食9690公斤。
    能取得这样出色的成绩，固然与这里良好的自然条件有关：地处松辽平原腹地，所辖15个县（市）都是国家定的玉米出口基地和商品粮基地；但更重要的是因为全市上上下下的主观努力。10年来，市委、市政府不仅始终没有动摇以农业为基础的思想，而且坚持把增加对农业的合理投入作为关键措施来抓。目前，一个良性的投入机制已初步建立起来，推动了农业、粮食生产健步发展。
          农民自投为主体
    10年间，长春市为粮食生产共投入47.18亿元（含劳动积累折金），平均每亩投入329元。为了保证对粮田的投入逐年有所增加，使粮食生产稳步发展，市委、市政府积极引导农村广大干部和群众克服单纯靠国家贷款搞粮食生产的依赖思想，逐步开辟全方位、多渠道地增加投入的途径，努力做到国家投入与地方投入相匹配，集体投入与农民自投相结合，并逐步把农民自投作为主体。
    （一）正确引导资金投向，使农民变消费资金为生产资金。1978年到1986年，每年全市农民自筹资金4000万至5000万元，近两年已增加到1.2亿至1.4亿元，占农业生产费用的24％。平均每个农户自筹150元以上，每亩地自筹投入10元左右。
    （二）制定预留生产费用基金制度，保证农民自筹资金的数量。市政府决定，每亩地年提取预留生产基金10—15元，每年新粮入库时，从农民卖粮款中划出存入银行，实行户有村管，专款专用，用于购买生产资料。
    （三）建立合作基金会，搞活集体积累资金。他们把家庭联产承包以前集体积累的资金折股到户，在乡镇建立合作基金会，并逐年扩大股金，实行民主管理，作为扩大再生产的周转金。目前，全市合作基金会拥有资金1.6亿元。
    （四）增加地方财政支农资金的比重。从1978年到1988年，市、县两级地方财政共拿出支农资金2.8亿元。1987年和1988年，市财政还从外汇分成中，每年拿出200万美元为农民购买进口磷肥。同时，他们还把农业信贷资金投入的重点放在粮食生产上。全市每年农业信贷净投放额为3.2亿至3.5亿元，其中80％用于粮食生产。
    （五）实行以劳补资、以资代劳的互补政策，大搞劳务投入。全市规定，每个劳动力每年出义务工15—20个，用于农田基本建设。因故不能出工的，出资代劳。1978年至1988年全市累计投工1.16亿个，折合资金6亿元，动用土方3.5亿立方米，对境内1500公里的江河堤防和19座大中型水库进行了除险加固，治理涝洼地360万亩，增强了抗御自然灾害的能力，为夺取粮食丰收创造了良好的条件。
    肥料、科技是重点
    长春市在粮食生产过程中，始终把肥料投入作为主要环节来抓。他们一方面合理增施化肥，同时十分注意积造、施用农家肥，并且把它作为保证粮食生产长期稳定发展的基础措施。市委、市政府制定了耕地保养制度，规定水旱田平均每公顷每年施优质农肥不少于20立方米；每年以乡为单位下达积肥任务，市、县组织有关部门分段验收，并把积肥多少、质量优劣与乡村干部的工资、奖金挂钩。对完不成积肥、施肥任务的农户，要求其缴纳养地基金，从而调动了农民积造农家肥的积极性。1988年全市施用化肥84万标吨，积造优质精量农家肥2880万立方米，分别比1987年增长105％和150％。
    长春市在农业生产中，始终把科技投入作为一项战略性措施，靠科技挖潜力，向科技要粮食。近几年，他们分层次、分学科对乡村干部进行了中短期培训，普及农业科学知识；他们围绕粮食生产，重点推广了玉米、水稻、大豆标准化栽培技术，优化配方施肥技术，采取综合科技措施改造中低产田，使用水稻大棚育苗和规范化旱育苗等10项新技术。
      科学投入求高效
    长春市发展粮食生产的投入原则是：以提高经济效益为中心，实行科学投入，大利大投，小利小投，无利不投，把农民致富和为国家多生产粮食有机地结合起来。为了获得较高的经济效益，他们对投入额大、涉及面广的重点项目首先搞好调查研究，请专家学者进行科学论证，制定投入方案。全市中低产田面积占耕地面积80％，为了增加对这部分土地的有效投入，市委、市政府通过组织有关部门和人员调查论证，大搞农田基本建设，采取了“低洼地作水田，平川地作旱田，瘠薄地种烤烟，盐碱地种糖料”工程措施与生物相结合的治理措施，现已改造30％的中低产田，收到了明显的增产效果。
