The main body of the Duhe Reservoir dam reinforcement project, the largest water conservancy hub in eastern Hebei, was recently completed by the 5th Division of the 16th Engineering Bureau under the Ministry of Railways. The project has met the design standards in one go.

The large reservoir, which was built in 1956, has a low flood control standard. Every year during the flood season, a large amount of manpower and resources are invested in flood control and emergency repairs, directly threatening the safety of Tangshan City. Last year, the State Council, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Hebei Provincial Government approved the reinforcement of the Duhe Reservoir dam. After the reinforcement, the dam crest is 7,346 meters long and 44 meters high.

    唐山陡河水库保坝工程完成
    本报讯　冀东最大的水利枢纽整治工程——唐山陡河水库保坝加固主体工程，最近由铁道部16工程局5处完成，并一次达到设计标准。
    这座始建于1956年的大型水库由于防汛标准不高，每年汛期都要投入大量人力物力防汛抢险，直接威胁唐山市的安全。去年，国务院、水利部和河北省政府批准对陡河水库大坝进行加固。加固后，大坝坝顶长7346米，高度达44米。
