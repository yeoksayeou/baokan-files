Following the implementation of rationed sugar supplies starting in May this year, the Soviet capital of Moscow has recently introduced a "new method for supplying scarce goods." The deputy chairman of the Moscow City Soviet Executive Committee, Zarov, explained in the August 23 issue of *Izvestia* that 40% of food and industrial goods sold in the capital, and 50% of scarce goods, are purchased by non-residents. The new method stipulates that starting immediately, all scarce food items will be centralized in specialized stores or designated counters in large food stores for Moscow residents. Some scarce industrial goods, such as shoes, clothing, televisions, refrigerators, furniture, and radios, will be delivered to various enterprises and institutions by the commercial departments or purchased with special supply cards. It is reported that planned supply goods account for approximately 13-15% of the city's total retail sales.

In the context of deteriorating market supplies across the Soviet Union, various regions are taking measures to protect local residents' interests and restrict purchases by non-residents. Moscow's government decision will inevitably lead to dissatisfaction among residents of other regions, further intensifying the "ticket wars" that have already erupted across the country.

    莫斯科实行供应新办法  使各地票证战愈演愈烈
    新华社莫斯科电　继今年5月开始凭票供应食糖之后，最近苏联首都莫斯科又实行“紧缺商品供应新办法”。
    莫斯科市苏维埃执委会副主席扎罗夫23日在《消息报》上解释说，首都出售的食品和工业品有40％，紧缺商品有50％被外地顾客买走。新办法规定，从即日起，一切短缺食品集中在为本市居民服务的专门商店或大食品店的专门柜台销售。一些紧缺的工业品——鞋、服装、电视机、电冰箱、家俱、收音机等，则由商业部门给各企业和机关送货上门，或凭特供卡购买。据悉，统配商品约占全市零售商品额的13—15％。
    在苏联市场供应每况愈下，各地纷纷采取保护本地居民利益、限制外地顾客购货的情况下，莫斯科市政府作出上述决定，必将引起其他地区居民不满，使各地业已爆发的“票证战”愈演愈烈。
