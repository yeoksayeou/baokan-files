An American expert named Able Nay, who worked for three years at the Shanghai Aviation Industry Corporation, said before returning to his country: Chinese enterprises generally emphasize material incentives while neglecting spiritual encouragement. He believes that using housing solutions for workers and increasing their bonuses as the main means to boost workers' enthusiasm may work in the short term, but will eventually become ineffective (see May 12, 1989, *Economic Daily*).

In recent years, with the opening up of the country, some people who have returned from abroad often tell us how enterprises in developed countries use material incentives to motivate people. They work hard for money, and it's very effective! Along with admiration, there is also an intention to advocate that we should imitate this. However, this expert from a company owned by a big American capitalist says that the McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Manufacturing Company, where he works, places great importance on the role of spiritual encouragement. They encourage employees to love their enterprise and work hard for it. We will not discuss the content and purpose of their spiritual encouragement, but the fact that a company owned by a capitalist does not rely solely on material incentives to solve all problems may make Chinese people think deeply.

Spiritual encouragement—wasn't this once our forte? In those past years of hardship and struggle, wasn't it with that bit of spirit that we overcame countless difficulties and defeated a powerful enemy? At that time, the enemy was most afraid of our ideological power—our spirit. A captured soldier, unwilling to fight in the enemy's camp, was a coward. Once he came to our side and received education on for whom to fight, he became a new person, turned his gun around, and fearlessly became a brave soldier. After the national victory, in the early days of the Republic and later during several serious difficulties, wasn't it with that bit of spirit that we overcame hardships and navigated through dangers? At that time, the "Daqing Spirit," "Iron Man Spirit," "Leifeng Spirit," and especially the "Jiaozhuo Lu Spirit," inspired countless cadres and the masses to strive and advance! Alas—these years people have become unfamiliar with these spirits. Thus, we have unknowingly lost many of our advantages, and recently, we have tasted the bitter fruit.

Yes, for a considerable period, there was indeed an extreme leftist trend. Some cadres' words and deeds did not match, and their personal conduct lacked persuasive power. They exaggerated the role of the spirit to the extreme, even to the point of absurdity, trying to eliminate people's seven emotions and six desires. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party corrected this absolutist approach and reaffirmed the principle of material interests, which is undoubtedly correct. Because everything people strive for is ultimately related to their interests. However, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized the need to grasp both aspects, and ideological and political work must not be relaxed. Unfortunately, we always tend to go to extremes. When emphasizing material rewards, we equated spirit with empty political rhetoric. In recent years, due to the significant weakening of ideological and political work, some people have focused solely on material interests, leading to distorted and exaggerated desires. The trend of competing for wealth and extravagance is on the rise, and various crooked strategies are emerging. It seems that the world has turned upside down. Talking about "practical benefits and money" has become fashionable, while talking about "ideals and spirit" is considered outdated. Being honest and straightforward is seen as naive, while exploiting policy loopholes to gain benefits is considered clever. The principle of material interests has been distorted and turned into an absolute and universal panacea.

It should be said that the principle of material interests does not exclude the role of spiritual encouragement; the two are complementary and integrated. When we talk about material interests, we include both collective and individual interests. Every Chinese person should first strive for the interests of the nation and the collective. "Realizing the Four Modernizations and revitalizing China" is in the best interest of all Chinese people. Without this great interest, our personal interests become like a tree without roots or a river without a source. Of course, individual interests are also important. We should seek a comfortable life and gradually improve our living standards in the development of the country, society, and production. To coordinate the interests of different levels of groups and to ensure that individual interests serve the collective interests, and that the interests of small groups serve the national interests, the role of "spirit" is needed.

The misinterpretation of the principle of material interests is to only care about oneself, not the whole, to only care about the present, not the future, to only care about small groups, not the entire nation and ethnicity, and even to consider harming the nation for personal gain as a skill and a glory. Therefore, it has a destructive nature, turning people into dwarfs of desire, lowering the spiritual and moral quality of society, leading to a decline in public morals, a scattered populace, and the emergence of various evil spirits. Relying solely on material incentives to achieve the goal of the Four Modernizations is like a one-legged mountaineer climbing Mount Everest—can it succeed?

To hear such a few sincere and frank words of advice from an American friend is also a gain from opening up.

    诤言数语份量沉
    钟锡锵
    在上海航空工业公司工作了3年之久的一位美国专家能奈，回国前对该公司说：中国的企业普遍偏重物质刺激，忽视精神鼓励。他认为，为提高工人的积极性，以解决工人的住房、提高他们的奖金作为主要手段，这在短期内可能管用，但时间长了就会失效（见1989年5月12日《经济日报》）。
    这些年开放了，一些出洋回来的人常告诉我们，发达国家的企业如何如何用物质刺激来调动人的积极性，人们为钱而拚命工作，灵得很！羡慕之余，也有鼓吹我们应大加仿效之意。但这位来自美国大资本家开的公司的教育专家却说，他所在的麦克唐纳·道格拉斯飞机制造公司十分重视精神鼓励的作用，鼓励雇员热爱自己的企业，为企业尽心尽力。我们姑且不论他们精神鼓励的内容和目的，但一个资本家开的公司竟没有仅凭物质刺激去解决一切问题，这可能会使国人深思之吧。
    精神鼓励，这不曾经是我们的看家本领拿手好戏吗？在过去那些出生入死的艰苦年代，我们不是凭着那么一点精神，才战胜千难万险、战胜强大的敌人？那时，敌人最害怕的是我们的思想力量——精神。一个俘虏兵，在敌人的营垒里不愿意卖命，是懦夫，一旦到了我们这边，受到了为谁而战的教育，他就变成了另外一个新人，掉转枪口，义无返顾，成为一名勇士。全国胜利之后，在共和国初创以及后来遇到几次严重困难的岁月里，我们不是凭着那么一点精神，度难关、闯险滩吗？那时节，“大庆精神”、“铁人精神”、“雷锋精神”，尤其是“焦裕禄精神”，曾经激励多少干部群众拚搏奋进！呜呼——这几年人们对这些精神感到陌生了。于是，我们很多优势无形中丢掉了，近来，终于使我们尝到了苦果。
    是的，在相当长时期中，确有极左思潮，有些干部言行不一，身教毫无说服力，曾经把精神的作用强调过了头，甚至搞“精神万能”，要灭绝人的七情六欲，从极端走向荒唐，人们连精神、信仰都丢掉了。党的十一届三中全会以后，拨乱反正，纠正这种绝对化的做法，重新肯定物质利益原则，这无疑是正确的。因为人们为之奋斗的一切，归根结蒂同他的利益相关联。但同时，小平同志一再强调两手抓，思想政治工作放松不得。然而令人遗憾的是我们做事总爱走极端，在重视物质奖励的时候，又把精神与空头政治划了等号。这几年由于思想政治工作大大削弱，致使一些人一心盯着物质利益，畸形膨胀，似乎有点人欲横流之势。社会上斗富比奢之风日盛，各种歪门邪道的“对策”层出不穷。似乎世道翻了个过。讲“实惠、金钱”成为时髦，讲“理想、精神”被认为僵化；老老实实的被认为迂腐，钻政策空子大捞好处的被认为有能耐。“物质利益原则”扭曲变形，被当作绝对的、普遍的灵丹妙药。
    应该说，物质利益原则不排斥精神鼓励的作用，两者是相辅相成、溶合一起的。我们讲的物质利益，包括整体利益和个人利益。每一个中国人，首先要争国家的利益、集体的利益。“实现四化，振兴中华”，这是全中国人民的最大利益所在，离开这个大利益，我们的个人利益就成了无源之水，无本之木。当然，个人利益是不可忽视的。我们要在国家、社会和生产的发展中，求得安居乐业，使个人生活水平逐步提高。为协调不同层次的群体利益关系，为了做到个人利益服从整体利益，局部的小集体利益服从国家利益，就需要发挥“精神”的作用了。
    对物质利益原则的曲解，就是只顾个人，不顾整体，只顾眼前，不顾长远，只顾小集体，不顾整个国家、民族，甚至以损国家利己为本事为光荣。所以，它具有一种破坏性，把人变为物欲的侏儒，使社会的精神道德素质下降，世风沉沦，人心涣散，生出种种邪魔妖术。专靠物质刺激来实现四化的目标，就好像一个瘸腿的登山运动员，攀登珠穆朗玛峰，能成吗？
    能听到一个美国友人这样几句中肯坦诚的诤言，这也是开放的一个收获吧。
