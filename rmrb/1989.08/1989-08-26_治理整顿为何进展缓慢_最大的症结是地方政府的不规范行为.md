The rectification and adjustment of the economic environment and economic order have yielded some results, but the progress has been slow. According to investigations, some achievements have been made: the nation has reduced and suspended approximately 70 billion yuan in construction project investments, which is less than one-third of the 220 billion yuan gap between total demand and total supply last year. About 17,000 companies have been merged or closed, accounting for about 15% of the 114,900 new companies established since the second half of 1986. The adjustment of the industrial structure has been minimal. Some key state-owned enterprises that should not have been scaled back have faced shortages of raw materials and funds this year, leading to a decline in production, while some township enterprises with high energy consumption and significant waste of raw materials continue to operate.

Where is the problem? The biggest issue lies in the irregular behavior of local governments: local administrative divisions, market segmentation. Economic decisions are made locally, with each region pursuing a "small but complete" local economy, competing to develop high-value-added processing industries and preventing the outflow of resources. As a result, not only have nationwide issues such as uncontrolled construction investment, distorted industrial structure, and inflated consumption funds emerged, but local governments have also adopted a non-cooperative attitude towards the central government's rectification and adjustment decisions.

Phenomenon One: Cutting "Shadow Projects." In the reported suspended projects, "shadow projects" account for more than half, and some "shadow projects" do not even exist. Very few actual ongoing projects have been affected. For example, a certain large city in East China reported 1,168 suspended projects, of which only 522 were ongoing projects, and 646 were planned projects.

Phenomenon Two: "Killing Chickens to Release Monkeys." In the cleanup and rectification of companies, almost all the "chickens" have been "slaughtered." Although the scale is large, very few of the influential "official speculators" have been dealt with.

Phenomenon Three: "Mother Hen Protecting Chicks." In a certain region in North China, nearly 80 textile mills have been established in recent years. When the province ordered a reduction, each county cited the inability to bear the financial burden and proposed that if someone provided 500 million yuan to the county, they would close one textile mill. As a result, not a single mill was reduced.

Phenomenon Four: "Launching Projects First and Reporting Later." At the end of last year, the State Council inspection team went to Shandong Province to check on work. At that time, it was decided that the technical renovation project of a certain city's cotton mill would be suspended, and the relevant responsible parties also agreed. After more than a month, when the inspection team went to Shandong again, the project had already been launched. (Excerpted from the August 9, 1989, edition of the *Hainan Special Zone Daily*)

### 治理整顿为何进展缓慢  最大的症结是地方政府的不规范行为

    治理整顿为何进展缓慢
    最大的症结是地方政府的不规范行为
    治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，收效如何？
    据调查表明，成绩是有的，但进展迟缓：目前全国已压缩停缓建基建项目投资额约700亿元，与去年全国总需求和总供给之间2200亿元的缺口相比，不足1／3；撤并公司约1.7万家，约占1986年下半年以来新成立公司11.49万的15％；调整产业结构收效甚微，不该压的一些国营骨干企业今年以来进入缺原料、少资金的困境，出现生产滑坡，而应该关停的一些能耗高、原材料浪费惊人的乡镇企业却照样机声隆隆；消费基金继续膨胀，势头不见减弱。
    问题到底出在哪里？最大的症结是地方政府的不规范行为：地方行政割据，分割市场。经济决策地方化，各地都搞本地经济上的“小而全”，竞相发展价高利大的加工产业，阻止资源外流。结果不仅出现了全国性的基建投资失控、产业结构畸形、消费基金膨胀等诸多问题，而且决定了地方对中央关于治理整顿决策不积极“合作”的态度。
    现象之一：砍“影子工程”。各地在上报的停缓建项目中，“影子工程”占半数以上，有的“影子工程”甚至连影都没有；真正触动的在建项目很少，如华东某大城市上报的停缓建项目共1168个，其中在建项目仅522个，预备项目有646个。
    现象之二：“杀小鸡放大猴”。各地清理整顿公司，“宰杀”的几乎是清一色的“小鸡”。虽然“声势浩大”，但那些影响较大的“官倒”并没有查处多少。
    现象之三：“老母鸡护小鸡”。华北某地区近些年光纱厂就上了80多家。省里让压，各县都以负担不起财政损失为由，提出谁给县里500万元我就压掉一个纱厂，结果一个也压缩不了。
    现象之四：上项目“先斩后奏”。去年底，国务院检查组曾赴山东省检查工作。当时确定了某市棉纺厂技改工程停建，有关方面负责人也表示同意。时隔一月多，检查组第二次赴山东时，这项工程却已上马。（摘自8月9日《海南特区报》）
