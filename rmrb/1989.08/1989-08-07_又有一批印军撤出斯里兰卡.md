Another batch of Indian troops has withdrawn from Sri Lanka. The press officer of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka announced today that 875 Indian soldiers left Sri Lanka last night.

The press officer said that the 875 Indian soldiers boarded an Indian warship at the port of Kankesanturai in northern Sri Lanka and returned to their country.

This is the second batch of troops that India has withdrawn from Sri Lanka since July 29th, when India resumed its withdrawal of troops, having already withdrawn 620 soldiers. India deployed 50,000 to 75,000 troops to the eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka in accordance with the agreement signed between India and Sri Lanka in July 1987 to maintain peace in the region. Currently, there are still 45,000 Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka.
