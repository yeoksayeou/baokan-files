If architecture is the stone book of history, then it should be the magnum opus of a historian who records events faithfully.

From the entrance of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, one ascends the stone steps to see the words "300,000 Victims" carved into the stone wall, which is shocking and heart-wrenching. Walking along the wall of the courtyard, the exhibition hall and the bone chamber are embedded half underground, like a tomb. Visitors see one horrific scene after another, and the tragedy of death shakes everyone's heart. The wailing that tears at one's heart echoes through space and time. The architect also uses the wall, the ground surface, and the arrangement of plants to create a tragic atmosphere, expressing the theme of life and death. Inside the courtyard, a large area is paved with cobblestones, with no grass growing, only a few withered trees. This contrasts sharply with the vibrant greenery around, embodying both the sorrow of death and the yearning for life.

This unique memorial building was completed on August 15, 1985. The designers were Qi Kang, Gu Qianguo, Zheng Jianing, and others from the Southeast University Architectural Design Research Institute and the Nanjing Municipal Architectural Design Institute. The site is near Jiangdongmen in the western part of Nanjing City, which was one of the main burial grounds for the compatriots massacred during the Nanjing Massacre. In December 1937, the Japanese invaders, like beasts, slaughtered innocent Chinese compatriots in Nanjing, causing a storm of bloodshed that shocked heaven and earth. The 300,000 souls cried out in grief. Building a memorial hall at the site of the "mass graves" of that year is deeply meaningful and reminds people to never forget. Today, what can comfort the souls of the deceased is that the Chinese people have finally stood up. The main culprit of the Nanjing Massacre, the butcher Katsuichi Konoe, was sentenced to death and executed at Yuhuatai.

The designer's concept focuses on creating the overall environmental atmosphere, breaking away from the common grand and symmetrical patterns of memorial halls in China. This provides a profound enlightenment.

Currently, the design of many memorial halls is not ideal. Some resemble temples, while memorial monuments imitate the forms of ancient pagodas or steles. The buildings are lifeless, devoid of cultural expression, and lack the designer's craftsmanship. Architecture is a symbol of human civilization. Memorial architecture is an even more direct expression of human civilization, capable of touching hearts and purifying souls. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders conveys historical information and has profound ideological content. It is a masterpiece of Chinese memorial architecture. It deservedly won the title of "Outstanding Architectural Work of the 1980s in China." Its appearance heralds a new development in the creation of memorial architecture in China.

    历史的纪念碑
    王明贤
    如果说建筑是石头的史书，那末，它就应当是秉笔直书的史家之绝唱。
    从南京大屠杀遇难同胞纪念馆入口沿石阶而上，迎面石壁镌刻着“遇难者300000”，惊心触目。沿院墙转行一周，陈列馆与遗骨室嵌入半地下，如同墓穴，观众看到了一幅幅地狱图画，死的悲愤震撼着每个人的心。撕裂人心的哭声在空间与时间中不断回荡。建筑师还通过院墙、地铺面、植物配置等环境手段烘托出悲剧气氛，表现了生与死的主题。院内大片鹅卵石铺地，寸草不生，只剩几棵枯树，与周围生机勃勃的绿意形成了鲜明的对照，既体现了死的悲痛，又反映了生的渴求。
    这一独特的纪念建筑于1985年8月15日落成，设计者为东南大学建筑设计研究所和南京市建筑设计院的齐康、顾强国、郑嘉宁等人。馆址在南京城西江东门附近，那里是当年大屠杀中惨遭屠戮的同胞的主要埋葬地之一。1937年12月，侵华日军野兽般的士兵在南京疯狂屠杀我无辜中国同胞，顿时腥风血雨，惊天地泣鬼神，30万冤魂在悲号。在当年的“万人坑”建纪念馆，寓意颇深，令人永矢勿忘。而今，能告慰死者在天之灵的是中国人民终于站起来了，南京大屠杀的主凶刽子手谷寿夫被判处极刑伏尸雨花台。
    作者的设计构思重点在整体环境氛围的创造，突破了我国现有纪念馆常见的雄伟、对称的图式。这给人以深刻的启示。
    现在不少纪念馆设计很不理想，有的形同庙宇，纪念碑则抄袭古塔或古碑的形式，建筑物麻木不仁，毫无文化表情，不见设计者的匠心。建筑是人类文明的象征。纪念建筑更是直抒胸臆的人类文明纪念碑，它能动人心弦净化灵魂。南京大屠杀遇难同胞纪念馆传达了历史的信息，具有深刻的思想内涵，是我国纪念建筑的杰作。它获得“中国八十年代建筑艺术优秀作品”称号当之无愧。它的出现，预示了我国纪念建筑创作能有一个新的进展。
