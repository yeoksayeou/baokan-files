The stolen and damaged murals from the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang have been restored to their original state by experts, regaining their magnificent and radiant splendor.

On January 14th of this year, five Yuan Dynasty Tibetan Buddhist Tantric murals were stolen from the Mogao Caves. On May 27th, based on the criminals' confessions, while searching for the stolen murals in the sand piles near the entrance of Cave 465, the murals were accidentally broken by tools. At this point, people began to wonder if these murals could be restored to their original condition.

On June 7th, the day after the Dunhuang mural theft case was solved, the Dunhuang Research Institute took back these recovered treasures from the public security personnel. They immediately formulated a restoration and organization plan and assigned relevant experts to personally restore them. On August 13th, when the reporter visited Cave 465, it was seen that the five murals had all been restored to their original positions. Except for the most severely damaged section on the south wall, which needed to refer to archival materials to redraw the surrounding patterns, the other four sections showed no signs of cutting and separation.

In other news, the reporter Zhang Shusheng reported: The collective and individuals who contributed to solving the Dunhuang Mogao Caves Cave 465 mural theft case have been commended. From August 13th to 14th, the Gansu Provincial Government, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage held a grand commendation meeting at the Dunhuang Research Institute.

After the internationally renowned Dunhuang mural theft case occurred, the public security officers of Gansu Province and the Jiuquan region worked tirelessly for over 140 days and finally arrested the criminals and recovered the stolen murals on June 5th of this year.

The Ministry of Public Security issued an order, awarding the Dunhuang Mogao Caves Cave 465 mural theft case investigation team of the Jiuquan Public Security Bureau a first-class merit citation, presenting a certificate and a 750-type three-wheeled motorcycle. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage decided to award a cash prize of 600,000 yuan to the Gansu Provincial Public Security Bureau. The Gansu Provincial Government and the Provincial Cultural Bureau also awarded cash prizes of 200,000 yuan to the units and individuals who contributed to solving the case.
