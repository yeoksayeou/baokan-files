Prince Sihanouk today issued a statement in Roissy-en-France, a suburb of Paris, refuting a report in the French newspaper *Libération* that had distorted his remarks. He stated that the report "does not conform to the facts."

The report in *Libération* said, "Prince Sihanouk announced yesterday that he and Roland Dumas, one of the two co-chairs of the International Conference on the Cambodian Problem and the French Foreign Minister, are considering a 'third compromise solution' for the distribution of power in Cambodia. According to this plan, a decision-making body including the Khmer Rouge will prepare for elections, and the government will be divided between Prince Sihanouk and the pro-Vietnamese Prime Minister Hun Sen."

Regarding the above report, Prince Sihanouk emphasized that it "does not conform to the facts" and that the "third solution is merely a French proposal, not a proposal by Sihanouk."

Prince Sihanouk announced that he adheres to his previous suggestions and consistent stance, which is to dissolve both the United Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Phnom Penh regime, and to form a quadripartite interim national unity government. He finally stressed that "a government organized by the Sihanouk-Hun Sen faction is unacceptable."

    西哈努克亲王发表声明坚持组成四方政府立场
    新华社巴黎8月18日电（记者茅瑞清）西哈努克亲王今天在巴黎郊区的鲁瓦西—昂—弗朗塞发表声明，驳斥了法国《解放报》今天刊登的一条歪曲他讲话内容的消息，指出“《解放报》的报道不符事实”。
    《解放报》的这则消息说，“西哈努克亲王昨天宣布，西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨问题国际会议的两主席之一、法国外交部长罗朗·迪马正在考虑就柬埔寨的政权分配问题寻找‘第三种妥协解决办法’。根据这项计划，由包括红色高棉在内的四方决策机构来准备大选、政府将由西哈努克亲王和亲越的洪森总理来分配。”
    对于《解放报》上述报道，西哈努克亲王强调它“不符合事实”外，认为“第三种解决办法仅是法国的建议，而不是西哈努克的建议”。
    西哈努克亲王宣布，他坚持他以前的建议和一贯立场，即同时解散民主柬埔寨联合政府和金边政权，组成四方临时民族团结政府。他最后强调指出，“西哈努克—洪森双方组织的政府是不能接受的。”
