Edition: 6

	Electric power irrigation facilities in our province's Xinshao County have suffered severe human-caused damage in recent years. The county has 623 medium and small-sized electric irrigation stations, 635 electric irrigation pumps, and an effective irrigation area of 101,900 mu, accounting for 30% of the county's paddy field area.

	In recent years, Xinshao County's electric irrigation machinery has suffered heavy losses. According to incomplete statistics, 132 electric irrigation stations in the county have been stolen, accounting for 21.2% of all electric irrigation stations. A total of 48 electric motors, 7 transformers, 59 low-voltage lines, and over 40 other electrical facilities have been damaged, resulting in direct economic losses of 269,000 yuan. This has led to a 20% reduction in the irrigated area. The reasons for this are:

	First, poor management and lack of supervision. Since the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, Xinshao County's public water conservancy irrigation facilities have lacked dedicated supervision. Additionally, many water conservancy irrigation facilities are located in remote areas, providing opportunities for lawbreakers.

	Second, weak enforcement and lenient penalties. Currently, lawbreakers are rampant. However, relevant departments do not pay enough attention, the case clearance rate is low, and efforts to recover stolen property and impose penalties are weak, leading to an increase in theft.

	Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, and such incidents of damaging water conservancy facilities seriously affect agricultural production. We appeal to relevant departments to take effective measures to prevent the spread of such illegal activities.

### 电力排灌设施　人为破坏严重

    电力排灌设施　人为破坏严重
    我省新邵县建有中小型电灌站623处，拥有电力排灌机635台，有效灌溉面积10.19万亩，占全县水田面积的30％。
    近年来，新邵县的电力排灌机械损失惨重。据不完全统计，全县有132处电灌站被盗，占全部电灌站的21.2％，损坏电机48台、变压器7台、低压线路59条和其它电气设施40多种，直接经济损失达26.9万元，使灌溉面积减少20％。究其原因是：
    一、管理不善，无人看守。自农村实行承包责任制以后，新邵县公共水利排灌设施无专人看管，加上不少水利排灌设施地处偏僻，使不法分子有可乘之机。
    二、查处不力，处罚不严。现在，不法分子作案十分猖獗。而有关部门却重视不够，破案率低，追赃不力，处罚不严，致使偷盗风越来越盛。
    水利是农业的命脉，类似这种破坏水利设施的事件严重影响农业生产。呼吁有关部门积极采取有效措施，绝不能让这种不法行为蔓延。
