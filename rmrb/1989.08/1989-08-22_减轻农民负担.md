Editor's Note:

Reducing the Burden on Farmers

Farmers' burdens can be categorized into reasonable and unreasonable. There is a popular saying in rural areas: "The agricultural tax is light, the collective levies and village funds are heavy, and temporary levies are bottomless pits." This means that farmers have no choice but to pay the "imperial grain tax" and national taxes; other levies within the policy-specified limits, such as collective levies and village funds, are also reasonable. The reason they are considered heavy is that the specified limits are often exceeded. In October 1985, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a notice to stop the arbitrary levies and fees on farmers. Various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also formulated specific regulations to reduce farmers' burdens based on their local conditions. Several years have passed, and from the implementation situation in various places, it can be seen that arbitrary levies, fundraising, and fees still occur in many places. In the context of rising prices for agricultural production materials and daily consumer goods and declining comparative benefits of planting, the growth rate of farmers' burdens has exceeded the growth rate of farmers' income, making it difficult for farmers to bear. Additionally, while the levy funds are taken from the people, they are not used for the benefit of the people, which is also a problem. If the levies outside the collective levies and village funds are used for public welfare projects, taken in moderation, and with the consent of the people, it is not unreasonable. However, some departments and village cadres, driven by immediate gains, engage in large-scale construction projects, arbitrarily levy funds, and collect miscellaneous fees, which inevitably make farmers resentful.

The burden on farmers is too heavy, and the problem persists year after year. This cannot but make us reflect deeply. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Feeding 1.1 billion people relies on farmers, and a portion of industrial raw materials comes from rural areas. When farmers' lives improve, the country's situation will also improve. We should not assume that because the rural economic situation is much better now, we can recklessly impose additional fees on farmers, engaging in "layered surcharges, creative fee collection, and high fees for reasonable projects" to exploit farmers. If farmers' burdens are too heavy, they will not benefit from a good harvest, and even their production and living conditions will be affected, which will impact farmers' morale and be detrimental to social stability and development. Therefore, leaders at all levels must fully recognize the importance of this issue, treat reducing farmers' unreasonable burdens as a major task in rural economic work, educate farmers to contribute to society, and protect their legitimate interests. They should correctly handle the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and individuals, formulate feasible policies and measures, establish and improve supervision and management mechanisms, prevent arbitrary fee collection from higher authorities, hold someone accountable when problems arise, and ensure that grassroots cadres in rural areas play an important role in reducing farmers' burdens. This way, things will be much easier to handle.

### 减轻农民负担

    减轻农民负担
    农民负担有合理与不合理之分。农村有句流行说法：“头税（指农业税）轻，二税（指提留、统筹款）重，临时摊派无底洞。”这是说，“皇粮国税”农民缴纳义不容辞；其它按政策规定限额以内的集体提留和乡统筹费，也是合理的。所以说重，是因为规定的限额常常被突破。1985年10月，中共中央、国务院发出了关于制止向农民乱派款、乱收费的通知，各省、市、自治区根据本地实际情况，也制定了减轻农民负担的具体规定。几年过去了，从各地执行的情况看，乱摊派、乱集资、乱收费的问题，在不少地方依然发生。在农业生产资料和日用消费品涨价、种植业比较效益降低的情况下，农民负担额的增长幅度超过了农民收入的增长幅度，农民难于承受。另外，提留款虽取之于民，却不能用之于民，这也是一个问题。提留、统筹费外的摊派款，如果用于公益事业，取之有度，群众自愿，也未尝不可。但一些部门和一些乡村干部急功近利，大搞基建，动辄集资摊派，乱收杂费，不能不让农民反感。
    农民负担过重，年年喊，年年有问题。这不能不引起我们的深思。农业是国民经济的基础，11亿人吃饭要靠农民，一部分工业原料要靠农村提供。农民日子好过，国家日子就好过。不要以为现在农村经济情况比过去好多了，就可以毫无顾忌地在农民身上打主意，干出“层层加码多收费，巧立名目乱收费，合理项目高收费”的挖农民的蠢事来。农民负担过重，丰收之后得不到实惠，甚至生产生活都发生困难，就会影响农民的情绪，不利于社会的安定和发展。因此，各级领导必须充分认识这个问题的重要性，要把减轻农民不合理的负担当作农村经济工作中的一件大事来抓，既要教育农民为社会作贡献，又要保护他们的合法利益，正确处理国家、集体与个人三者的利益关系，制订切实可行的政策、措施，建立健全监督管理机制，上面不乱开口子，出了问题有人追究，具体执行政策的农村基层干部，在减轻农民负担中切实发挥重要作用。这样，事情就好办得多了。
