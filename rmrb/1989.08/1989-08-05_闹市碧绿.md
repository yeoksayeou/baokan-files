On the map of London, patches of green are scattered everywhere. These are the large and small parks that dot the entire city. Among them, near the Hampstead district in northwest London where we reside, there is a vast green expanse renowned in the writings of famous authors alongside Hyde Park and Regent's Park—Hampstead Heath (meaning heath covered with heather).

As a famous residential area in London that developed during the 18th and 19th centuries, Hampstead was once described by the American magazine *Harper's* in 1883 as "one of the most magnificent districts in the world." In terms of its green spaces, a British writer praised it for having "the tranquil charm of the English countryside." Indeed, here, the bustling atmosphere of the city and the tranquil charm of the countryside are harmoniously united.

The first time I visited Hampstead Heath, it was in the winter when golden leaves carpeted the ground. Here, there are high, rolling hills and narrow, low valleys. The trees block out the sky, and at a glance, it resembles a primeval forest, full of wild charm and a hint of mystery.

The second time I visited, it had donned a light green dress, full of life and vitality. Following a smooth, flat path, there are not only trees but also wide, green lawns. In a pool of clear water, waterfowl swim, leaving ripples in their wake. Bushes grow by the water's edge, and large trees lie horizontally across the water, creating a poetic and picturesque scene. In the bustling metropolis of London, tranquility is a true luxury. I sat leisurely on a bench by the path, and through the gaps in the leaves, I saw red, yellow, white, and other colorful clothes, appearing and disappearing, coming and going, truly delightful: here is life! Suddenly, I noticed that the back of the bench I was sitting on was clearly inscribed with "1890-1959," which took my thoughts back to a distant era.

At that time, this place was not only a resting spot for Londoners but also a cradle for poets, artists, and thinkers to cultivate their emotions and create magnificent poems or grand works. They would either wander by the clear lake or lie on the grassy ground, letting their thoughts flow like a river.

The proletarian revolutionary leader Marx was a frequent visitor here. From March 1875 to March 14, 1883, the Marx family lived at 41 Maitland Park Road, not far from the Heath. Marx's son-in-law, the international labor movement activist Paul Lafargue, often accompanied him on walks "along the grassy paths," discussing economics and *Das Kapital*. Marx's daughters were not allowed to work on Sundays, and on good weather days, the whole family would often go to the Heath for outings. At that time, one could often see him playing joyfully with his children.

In 1816, the great British poet Byron and Shelley, along with their friend Leigh Hunt, lived in the Heath's Vale of Health. The great romantic poet Keats often visited them from his residence in Wentworth, just a few hundred meters from the southern end of the Heath, and would often stay here. Keats himself frequently walked in the Heath in the evenings. Now, Keats's former residence has become the Keats Museum. It is said that his famous work "Ode to a Nightingale" was written under a plum tree in the garden outside his house. In 1837, the famous British novelist Charles Dickens lived in the Heath's Wilds Farm, and another renowned British novelist, Lawrence, also lived here. In the 1930s, the Spanish painter and leading representative of the French modernist school Pablo Picasso visited his friend Roland Penrose at 21 Downshire Hill, near the Heath.

The enchanting quality of Hampstead Heath is also the result of the public's struggle against private greed. To save the Heath, Londoners who advocated for environmental protection fought with the local Wilson family for over half a century. This lord attempted to close the Heath and build a mansion, while the local people fiercely defended their right to graze on this "public" grassland. The dispute escalated into what historians call the "Battle of Hampstead Heath." In his rage, Lord Wilson dug up the sand, and the gullies on the hills today are still the scars left by the lord on the Heath. Under the people's resolute opposition, Lord Wilson's scheme failed, and the Heath has since retained its original appearance to this day.

A sound of footsteps approached, and a pair of young students walked by, whispering. Not far away, an elderly couple stood in front of a towering ancient tree. Their affection for this garden, lingering and reluctant to leave, reflected the Londoners' cherished feelings for trees and grass. On a nearby green hill, a couple, after having a picnic, were packing up the cloth they had spread on the grass and throwing it into a nearby trash bin. There was not a single piece of litter around. This made me feel the people's spontaneous awareness of preserving natural scenery. Yes, looking around, there was no sign of any trees being cut down. The Heath, which has endured the vicissitudes of time, is not only lush with flowers and trees and fragrant with grass, but also has museums and art galleries, making it a unique tourist destination in London. This is not only due to the mild, humid climate but more importantly, it is the Londoners' spirit of protecting greenery.

Unable to resist the allure of the dense forest, I walked through the valley in the setting sun, climbing the hill to enjoy the verdant greenery amidst the bustle.

    闹市碧绿
    陈特安
    在伦敦地图上，片片绿色星罗棋布。那是标明遍布全市的大小公园。其中，在我们居住的伦敦西北部汉普斯特德街区附近，就有一座名家笔下与海德公园、摄政公园齐名的广阔绿色地带——汉普斯特德希思（意即石南丛生的荒地）。
    作为18至19世纪发展起来的伦敦有名的汉普斯特德居住区，就其当年的繁华景象而言，曾被美国《哈珀斯》杂志在1883年誉为“世界最壮观的街区之一”；就其绿色地带而言，一位英国作家则称赞她具有“幽静的英国乡村风韵”。确实，在这里，繁华都市的气息与幽静乡村的风韵是那样和谐统一。
    我第一次造访汉普斯特德希思时，是金色落叶铺地的冬天。这儿有高高隆起的山丘，有低低狭长的谷地，树木遮天，一眼望去，酷似原始森林，野趣横生而又隐现着几分神秘。
    我第二次造访她时，她已换上了淡绿色的纱裙，生机盎然，充满活力。顺着一条平坦光滑的小道走去，那里不仅有树木，还有宽阔的绿色草坪；一池碧水里，水鸟游过，划下一道道涟漪。水边灌木丛生，大树枝横娇斜地醉卧水上，颇具诗情画意。在热闹的大都会伦敦，宁静真是一种享受。我悠然坐在小路旁一条长椅上，透过树叶间隙，看到红、黄、白等五颜六色的服装，时隐时现，时近时远，真令人欣喜：这里充满生命的气息！猛回首，我发现我所坐的长椅背上，清晰地刻着“1890—1959”字样，它把我的思绪带到久远的年代。
    那时，这儿不仅是伦敦市民休憩之地，也是诗人墨客、艺术家、思想家陶冶情感，酝酿壮美诗篇或宏篇巨著的摇篮。他们或徘徊于清明似镜的湖畔，或仰卧在绿草如茵的地上，一任思绪似江河奔腾。
    无产阶级革命导师马克思当年就是这儿的常客。从1875年3月到1883年3月14日，马克思一家一直住在离希思不远的梅特兰公园路41号。马克思的女婿、国际工人运动活动家保尔·拉法格总是伴随他到这儿“沿着草地散步”，边走边谈“经济学和《资本论》”。马克思的女儿们星期天是不允许父亲工作的，天气好的时候，全家常到希思郊游。那时往往可以看到他与孩子们尽情嬉戏。
    1816年，在世界上享有崇高声誉的英国伟大诗人拜伦和雪莱与好友利·亨特就曾住在希思的巴莱。伟大的浪漫主义诗人济慈时常从他离希思南端只有几百米远的文特沃思住所到这儿拜会他们，并常在这儿小住。济慈本人也常在傍晚到希思散步。现在，济慈故居已成为济慈博物馆。据说他的名作《夜莺颂》就是在屋外花园一棵李树下写成的。1837年，英国著名小说家查尔斯·狄更斯曾住在当时伦敦郊区希思的威尔德斯农庄，另一英国知名小说家劳伦斯也曾在这里居住过。而本世纪30年代，西班牙画家、法国现代画派的主要代表帕勃洛·毕加索也到与希思近在咫尺的唐希雷小丘21号访问过他的好友罗兰·彭罗斯先生。
    希思林园令人神往的气质，又是公众反对私人贪欲斗争的结果。为了拯救希思，伦敦主张保护环境的人们与当地马里恩·威尔逊爵士家族进行了长达半个多世纪的斗争。这位爵士企图关闭希思并在此建造宅地，而当地百姓则坚决维护他们在这块“公共”草地上的放牧权利。双方争执不下，终于产生了史学家们所称谓的“汉普斯特德希思之战”。马里恩·威尔逊盛怒之下挖地卖沙，今天人们仍然可见的丘坡上的沟沟壑壑，便是那位爵士给希思刻下的伤痕。在人们的坚决反对下，马里恩·威尔逊的图谋破产了，希思从此便以她的原始风貌留芳至今。……
    一阵脚步声传来，一对青年学生低语着从我身边走过。不远处，一对老年夫妇站在参天古树前。他们对这座林园悠然神往、流连忘返之情，折射出伦敦人对树木、草地视若至宝的情愫。而在不远处的绿色山坡上，一对情侣野餐后，正在收拾他们铺在草地上的方巾，包好后投放到附近的垃圾箱内。周围没有丢弃一张废纸。这又使我感受到人们自发的维护自然景观的意识。是的，放眼四周，见不到任何砍折树木的痕迹。久历沧桑的希思林园不仅花繁林茂、芳草处处，而且还有博物馆和艺术画廊等等，成为别具一格的伦敦旅游胜境。这固然有赖于温和湿润的气候，但更为重要的，还是伦敦人保护绿色的精神。
    经不住密林深处的诱惑，我沐着夕阳，穿过谷地，向山岗攀登，去享受那闹市中的碧绿。
