State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of the national economy. Revitalizing these enterprises and leveraging their role as the backbone is a major task in economic reform and development. Leveraging the role of large and medium-sized enterprises involves issues related to the development path of the national economy, the planning system, and enterprise management methods.

The Development Path of the National Economy

In recent years, the actual status of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises has declined. This is mainly manifested in the following ways: investment and economic growth have significantly tilted towards non-state-owned enterprises, towards general processing industries, non-essential consumer goods industries, and commercial services, and towards small (unreasonable scale), chaotic (disorganized and non-standard management), and inferior (technologically backward, low product quality, poor economic performance) enterprises. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have insufficient updates and renovations as well as basic construction. The basic industries and major equipment manufacturing industries where state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are concentrated are severely underdeveloped. The proportion of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, which have higher labor productivity and better economic performance, in the increase of national gross output and especially industrial total output has significantly decreased.

The essence of the problems reflected in this situation is: should China's modernization construction take the path of relatively high industrial structure, reasonable scale of operations, and intensive economic development, or should it take the path of low structure, dispersed operations, and extensive development? It must be clearly recognized that under the conditions of severe shortages of modern production factors (especially capital and technology) at home and intense pressure from international economic competition, only by taking the former path can this developing country achieve relatively good macroeconomic benefits and relatively high microeconomic efficiency, and maintain the necessary independence in the world economic pattern. Taking the former path requires, based on the overall needs of the country, nation, and society, relatively concentrating financial and material resources, prioritizing the development of urgently needed fields and projects, and highlighting the leading role of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the development of productive forces and industrial structure progress.

How to Reform the Planned Economic System

Currently, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises lack vitality. There is a view that the fundamental reason lies in the constraints of mandatory planning on state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and therefore the only way out is to ultimately abolish mandatory planning. This view needs to be reconsidered.

Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are mostly in the short-supply sectors and key industries of the national economy. To achieve macroeconomic balance and structural progress as much as possible under long-term and severe resource shortages, the state must implement a certain form and degree of mandatory planning management for these enterprises. This is not something that can be abolished at will. However, the original planned economic system must also be reformed.

How to reform the planning system? In recent years, simply continuously reducing the scope of mandatory planning and expanding the scope of market regulation has placed state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in a double bind: on the one hand, the product-based mandatory planning has not been effectively reformed; on the other hand, the economic activities of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises can no longer be fully incorporated into the planning track. When they seek help from the "local market," they often cannot win in the unregulated competition (such as "rebate wars," "bribery wars," "resale wars," etc.) with other types of enterprises. Moreover, the "local market" often "proactively advances" into the mandatory planning domain.

Practice of reform shows: simply reducing the scope of mandatory planning and simply expanding the scope of market regulation is far from enough. It is necessary to appropriately determine the domains of the planned economy and market regulation; at the same time, it is necessary to gradually make mandatory planning possess the form of commodity economy, gradually establish operable guiding plans, and gradually form a powerful macro-management of market operations, so that state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises can obtain mechanism guarantees in both driving macroeconomic development and improving their own operational efficiency.

What Management Forms Should Enterprises Adopt?

Currently, the vast majority of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have implemented the contract responsibility system. In this regard, there are two types of issues worth noting:

First, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have large assets and complex management, and they bear heavy economic responsibilities to the state and society. Therefore, in the specific contract methods and contract contents, they should be different from other types of enterprises: they should not adopt individual contract forms and can adopt collective contracts, leadership team contracts, legal person contracts, etc.; they should appropriately determine the internal management forms of the enterprises according to the technical characteristics and management characteristics of large-scale industry, and not necessarily implement layer-by-layer contracts to infinitely reduce the scale of operations. Some state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are indeed not suitable or do not need to implement the contract responsibility system, so they should not be forced; instead, these enterprises should, under the guidance of the state, determine the management methods suitable for their own situation through practice.

Second, due to the imperfect price system, tax system, and other macroeconomic conditions, the implementation of the contract responsibility system cannot fairly and accurately reflect the actual economic benefits of enterprises, and the contract results of different enterprises are often unequal; the contract responsibility system also easily leads to short-term behavior tendencies that cannot be ignored in enterprise development and consumption fund allocation. Therefore, the contract responsibility system, as a management method suitable for national conditions, should currently be improved according to the requirements of deepening reform and adjusting the industrial structure.

    发挥大中型企业的骨干作用
    方觉
    国营大中型企业是国民经济的命脉所在，搞活大中型企业，发挥大中型企业的骨干作用，是经济改革、经济发展中的重大课题。发挥大中型企业的作用，涉及到国民经济发展道路、计划体制、企业经营方式等问题。
    国民经济走什么样的发展道路
    近年来国营大中型企业的实际地位降低了，其主要表现是投资和经济增长明显地向非全民所有制企业倾斜，明显地向一般加工工业、非必需消费品工业和商业服务业倾斜，明显地向小（规模不合理）、乱（经营管理混乱而不规范）、差（技术落后、产品质量低、经济效益差）的企业倾斜。国营大中型企业无论是更新改造还是基本建设都不够；国营大中型企业集中的基础产业领域和主要生产设备产业领域，都严重发展不足；国民生产总值特别是工业总产值的增加额中，劳动生产率比较高、经济效益比较好的国营大中型企业所占比重明显减少。
    这种状况所表现的问题的实质是：我国的现代化建设，是走产业结构相对高度化、单位经营规模合理化和经济发展集约化的路子，还是走结构低度化经营分散化发展粗放化的路子？必须清醒地看到：在国内现代生产要素（特别是资金和技术）严重短缺和国际经济竞争压力紧迫的条件下，只有走前一条路，我们这个发展中的大国才可能取得较好的宏观经济效益和较高的微观经济效率，才可能在世界经济格局中保持必要的独立性。走前一条路，就要求根据国家、民族、社会的整体需要，相对集中财力物力，优先安排急需发展的领域和项目，突出国营大中型企业在生产力发展和产业结构进步中的主导作用。
    怎样改革计划经济体制
    目前，大中型国营企业缺乏活力，有一种看法认为，根本原因在于指令性计划对国营大中型企业的束缚，因此出路只能是最终取消指令性计划。这种看法需要商榷。
    国营大中型企业大都处于国民经济的短线领域和主导产业。为了在长期而严重的资源短缺条件下尽可能实现宏观经济平衡和结构进步，国家就必须对这类企业实行一定形式一定程度的指令性计划管理。这不是主观上想取消就能取消的。但是，对原有的计划经济体制也必须进行改革。
    如何改革计划体制？这些年简单地不断缩小指令性计划的范围、扩大市场调节的范围，国营大中型企业实际上处于双重的困难之中：一方面，产品经济型的指令性计划尚未有效地改革；另一方面，国营大中型企业的经济活动又已经不能完全纳入计划轨道，当它们求助于“局部市场”时，却往往不能在同其它类型企业的不规范竞争（例如“回扣战”、“贿赂战”、“倒卖战”等等）中取胜，而且“局部市场”还不时向指令性计划领域“主动进取”。
    改革的实践说明：仅仅简单地缩小指令性计划范围和简单地扩大市场调节范围是远远不够的。需要恰当确定计划经济和市场调节各自的领域；同时，要着重于逐步使指令性计划具备商品经济形式，逐步建立可操作的指导性计划，逐步形成对市场运行的有力的宏观管理，以使国营大中型企业在带动宏观经济发展和提高自身运营效率两方面获得机制上的保证。
    企业采取什么样的经营形式？
    目前绝大多数国营大中型企业实行了承包制。在这方面有两类问题值得注意：
    第一、国营大中型企业资产庞大，管理复杂，对国家和社会的经济责任重。因此在具体的承包方式和承包内容上，应与其它类型企业有所不同：它们不宜采取个人承包形式，可以采取集体承包、领导班子承包、法人承包等形式；它们要根据大工业的技术特点和经营特点，恰当确定企业内部的经营形式，不一定都搞层层承包，把经营规模无限划小。一些国营大中型企业确实不适宜或不需要搞承包制的，就不要一刀切；要让这些企业在国家指导下经过实践，确定适合自身情况的经营方式。
    第二、由于价格体制、税收制度等宏观经济条件很不完善，实行承包不能比较公平准确地体现企业的实际经济效益，不同企业在承包结果上往往苦乐不均；承包制在企业发展和消费基金分配上也容易引发不容忽视的短期行为倾向。因此，承包制作为适合国情的一种企业经营方式，当前要按照深化改革、调整产业结构的要求，使之更加完善。
