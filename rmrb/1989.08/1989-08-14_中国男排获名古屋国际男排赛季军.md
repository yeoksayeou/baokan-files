China's men's volleyball team lost to Japan 1-3 in the final match of the Nagoya International Men's Volleyball Tournament held today in Nagoya City, securing third place with one win and two losses. Japan and India won the championship and runner-up positions, respectively.

The match between China and Japan was the last game of the tournament. The scores for the four sets were: 11-15, 15-1, 6-15, and 9-15. Earlier, India defeated Spain 3-1 in another match.

The Nagoya International Men's Volleyball Tournament featured four teams. China lost to India 2-3 the day before yesterday and defeated Spain 3-0 yesterday.

Japan won all three of their matches in the tournament, India had two wins and one loss, and Spain lost all three of their matches, finishing in fourth place.

China's coach, Yu Youwei, was interviewed by telephone this afternoon and said that the team had generally performed to their potential in this tournament, and the players had all tried their best. He said that the team had only been together for half a year and was still immature, with rough techniques and tactical coordination issues. The players, due to their lack of experience in international competitions, appeared tense during the matches, even when leading. Coach Yu believed that the biggest gain for China in participating in this tournament was recognizing their own weaknesses. He said that upon returning to China, the team would focus on these issues to strengthen training and strive for good results in the Asian Volleyball Championship to be held in September.

    中国男排获名古屋国际男排赛季军
    新华社东京8月13日电　（记者姜占国）中国国家男排今天在名古屋市举行的名古屋国际男子排球赛最后一天比赛中，以1∶3负于日本队，从而以1胜2负名列这次比赛的第三名。日本队和印度队分获冠军、亚军。
    中国队和日本队的比赛是这次国际排球赛的最后一场比赛。4局的比分是：11∶15，15∶1，6∶15，9∶15。在此之前举行的另一场比赛中，印度队以3∶1胜西班牙队。
    名古屋国际男子排球赛共有4个队参加。中国队前天以2∶3负于印度队，昨天3∶0胜西班牙队。
    日本队在这次比赛中3战全胜，印度队2胜1负，西班牙队3战皆负名列第四。
    中国队教练于有为今天下午在接受了本社记者的电话采访时认为，中国队在这次比赛中基本发挥出了自己的水平，队员们都是努力的。他说，中国队组队才半年，还不成熟，技术粗糙，战术配合还存在问题。队员由于参加国际比赛少，比赛中显得紧张，甚至在领先时也紧张。于教练认为中国队参加这次比赛的最大收获是看到了本身的差距和薄弱环节。他说，中国队回国后要针对这些问题加强训练，争取在9月举行的亚洲排球锦标赛上取得好成绩。
