I have always loved rainy excursions. Whether it is a light drizzle or a heavy downpour, nothing can dampen my enthusiasm and spirit.

I love the hazy, subtle beauty of a light drizzle!

In my childhood in my hometown of Zhenjiang, I often stood by the riverbank in the rain, gazing at the misty rain over the river, where the sky and water blended into one. The Three Mountains (Jin, Jiao, and Beigu) appeared and disappeared, like a faint ink landscape painting, taking me into a fairy-tale world. When will I ever experience this scene again?

“It enters the night with the wind, moistening things silently,” Du Fu captured the essence of light rain. “Spring is in the soft drizzle,” Northern Song poet Zhong Shu also revealed the mystery of spring rain. “Apricot blossoms, spring rain, Jiangnan,” the spring of Jiangnan is always associated with rain. Imagine if you took away the rain, it would lose its charm.

In my youth, when the Japanese invaders attacked our sacred land, I was like a wounded swallow, flying from Jiangnan to Poyang, to Jianghan, to Dongting, and to the Twelve Peaks of Wushan. As I sailed through the Three Gorges in the rain, “the mountains are in the ethereal and vague,” with clouds and mist swirling, the scenery was strange and wondrous. Alas, my youth, touched by the scene, the homeland is far away, where is the returning boat? Looking at the wind, how can I not be filled with longing?

I once braved the rain to climb Taiping City and looked down at the hazy scenery of Xuanwu Lake, reciting Sa Du's words: “Two swallows in front of the Wang and Xie mansion, once known at the entrance of Wu Cloth Alley” (“Màn Jiāng Hóng · Jinling Huái Gǔ”), reminiscing about the past “six dynasties of splendor,” leaving only traces. I also braved the rain to visit Du Fu's Thatched Cottage, where the courtyard is deep and quiet, the bamboo leaves rustling, my thoughts spanning a thousand years, remembering this poet of the ages. The most enthusiastic and memorable experience was a few years ago when I braved the rain with a friend to visit West Lake. We shared an umbrella, walking from the Broken Bridge to Su Causeway, resting at the Willow Smoke Tower, facing the “mountains shrouded in mist, the rain is also strange” West Lake, and our poetic inspiration surged. At that time, we were completely immersed in the poetic and picturesque scenery.

The light rain is lingering, and the thoughts are affectionate. In the rain, whether strolling in the courtyard, standing in the mountains, or facing the lake and river, one can only see the dew drops on the grass, leaves, and petals, sparkling and refreshing. The eyebrows, hair, and collar seem wet but not really wet. Wandering in the rain, savoring the rain, there is a unique charm and rhythm.

I love the rugged, unrestrained beauty of a heavy downpour!

In my early years, I wandered in the mountain city of Chongqing. I once braved the spring thunder and heavy rain, boarded a night ferry, and hurriedly glanced at the stars-like lights on both banks dancing on the water surface. Who would have thought that the rainy night in Chongqing was so elegant and romantic. Li Shangyin's “Night Rain in Ba Mountain” stirred the homesickness of countless travelers?

Nine years ago, I visited Guilin and climbed Diecai Mountain. When I was climbing the mountain, the weather was clear, but when I was near the peak, suddenly the clouds gathered, and the wind howled, truly “the wind is full when the mountain rain is about to come.” Then, a waterfall-like torrential rain poured down. Fortunately, there was a pavilion on the mountaintop where we could take shelter. The tourists came from various places, some from the foot of Tianshan, some from the Songhua River, some from Hong Kong and Macau, and some from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Everyone spontaneously crowded into the pavilion. There was no restraint, everyone was chatting and laughing, very friendly. A grain of sand in the vast sea, a drop of water in the boundless sea of people, gathering here, having the fate to meet, meeting and recognizing each other, it can be said that “sharing the pavilion in the wind and rain,” how rare!

Soon, the wind stopped and the rain cleared, the sun peeked out from the clouds, casting a thousand beams of light. After the rain, Guilin was like a piece of jade, washed even more brightly and charming. Everyone came out of the pavilion with smiles, each enjoying the freshness and ease after the rain.

The storm washed away the filth of the world, and I felt a kind of unprecedented exhilaration. Shelley praised the eagle in the storm, and Gorky sang the seagull in the storm. The eagle soars in the sky, the seagull flies through the heavens, flying so freely and comfortably, really making people envious.

How delightful is the joy of a rainy excursion? Only those who have experienced it can appreciate it. May those who wish to try, come and enjoy!

    雨游
    陈玉龙
    生平爱雨游。无论是细雨淅沥，或是大雨滂沱，都不能减却我的游兴和豪情。
    我爱细雨淅沥时那种朦胧、含蓄的美！
    幼年在故乡镇江，常爱在雨中伫立江岸，凭眺江上烟雨凄迷，水天一色。三山（金、焦、北固）若隐若现，仿佛是一幅淡墨山水画，把我带入童话般的幻境。此情此景，何时再得？
    “随风潜入夜，润物细无声”，杜甫点破了细雨的特色。“春在蒙蒙细雨中”，北宋诗人仲殊也道出了春雨的奥秘。“杏花、春雨、江南”，江南之春总是和雨联系在一起的。试想如果抽掉了雨，就将失去它的魅力。
    少年时，日寇进犯我神圣国土，我像一只受伤的乳燕，从江南奋翮西飞，飞向鄱阳，飞向江汉，飞向洞庭，飞向巫山十二峰。雨中船过三峡，“山在虚无缥缈中”，云雾缭绕，景色奇诡。嗟我少年，触景生情，乡关万里，归舟何处？望风怀想，能不依依？
    我曾冒雨登台城，俯瞰玄武湖一片朦胧景色，低吟萨都刺词：“王谢堂前双燕子，乌衣巷口曾相识”（《满江红·金陵怀古》），遥想当年“六代豪华”，空余陈迹。我也曾雨游杜甫草堂，庭院幽深，竹叶婆娑，思接千载，缅怀这旷代诗圣。游兴最浓、印象最深的要算几年前与书友雨游西湖了。我俩共擎一把伞，从断桥漫步到苏堤，在柳烟楼小憩，面对“山色空蒙雨亦奇”的西子湖，诗兴大发，便以烟、雨为题，联词作乐。那时我们完全沉浸在诗情画意之中。
    细雨缠绵，思绪缱绻。雨中，或是信步庭园，或是置身山陬，或是面湖临江，只见草上、树叶上、花瓣上水珠晶莹欲滴，沁人心脾。眉毛、头发、衣襟，似湿非湿。雨中徜徉，雨中吟味，别具一番情趣和韵致。
    我爱大雨滂沱时那种粗犷、豪放的美！
    早年浪迹山城重庆。我曾冒着春雷，淋着急雨，跨上夜渡的船，匆忙中偷看那两岸繁星似的灯火，在水面跃动。没想到雾重庆的雨夜竟是这样的蕴藉风流。李商隐笔下的巴山夜雨牵动游子们多少乡愁？
    九年前，游桂林，登叠彩山。上山时，天气晴朗，快到山巅时忽然乌云四合，狂风大作，真是“山雨欲来风满楼”。接着，瀑布一样的倾盆大雨直泻而下。幸而，山顶有一座亭子可以栖身。游客们有的来自天山之麓，有的来自松花江畔，有的来自港澳，有的来自大西洋彼岸，……大家都不约而同地挤到亭子里。彼此间无拘无束，有说有笑，分外亲切。沧海一粟，茫茫人海中的一滴水，汇聚到这里，有缘邂逅，相逢且相识，可谓“风雨同亭”，多么难得啊！不一会，风停雨霁，太阳从云缝里探出头来，洒下万道霞光。雨后的桂林，宛如一块碧玉，濯洗得更加晶莹，更加妩媚。人们一个个带着笑颜从亭中星散而出，各自领略这雨后的清新和洒脱。
    暴风雨荡涤了人间的污泥浊水，我感到一种从未有过的痛快。雪莱赞美暴风雨中的雄鹰，高尔基讴歌暴风雨中的海燕。鹰击长空，燕穿霄汉，飞得那么酣畅，那么自在，实使人艳羡。
    雨游之乐乐如何？只有实践亲知的人，才能领略其一二。愿尝试者，盍兴乎来？！
