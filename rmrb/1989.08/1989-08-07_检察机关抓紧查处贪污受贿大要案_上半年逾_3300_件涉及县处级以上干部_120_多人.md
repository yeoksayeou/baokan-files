    Prosecutorial agencies across the country investigated and prosecuted more than 3,300 major cases of bribery and embezzlement in the first half of the year, involving over 120 county-level and above officials, and 11 bureau-level officials.

    According to relevant departments of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, since the beginning of this year, procuratorial agencies across the country have paid special attention to investigating and prosecuting cases where the amount of bribery and embezzlement exceeds 100,000 yuan and where the suspects hold county-level or above leadership positions. The number of such cases investigated and prosecuted in the first half of this year increased by 1.5 times compared to the same period last year. Among these, there were more than 1,000 major bribery cases, an increase of 4.7 times compared to the same period last year. According to statistics, there were 78 cases where the amount of bribery and embezzlement exceeded 100,000 yuan, including 8 cases where the amount was between 300,000 and 500,000 yuan, 6 cases where the amount exceeded 500,000 yuan, with the highest amount reaching 1.86 million yuan.

    The Supreme People's Procuratorate reported that in the first half of this year, procuratorial agencies at all levels investigated and prosecuted more than 16,000 cases of bribery and embezzlement, an increase of 60% compared to the same period last year.

    It is understood that in the first half of this year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate dispatched 5 procurator-generals and deputy procurator-generals, more than 10 bureau-level officials, and dozens of division-level officials in two batches to various places to handle cases. In mid-May, despite the severe turmoil in Beijing, the Supreme People's Procuratorate held a special meeting to deploy the strengthening of anti-corruption work. In mid-June, they conducted a focused inspection of the work in more than 10 major cities to understand if there were any "slippages" and issued a document requiring all places to "while resolutely investigating and prosecuting counter-revolutionary rioters, must also tightly grasp the anti-corruption work, and cannot relax at all."

    It is reported that the approximately 3,000 complaint centers established by procuratorial agencies across the country have played an active role in investigating and prosecuting bribery and embezzlement cases. In some places, starting from a single complaint letter, more than 20 or 30 bribery and embezzlement suspects have been consecutively uncovered.

    据最高人民检察院有关部门介绍，今年以来，全国各地检察机关特别注意查处贪污受贿金额在万元以上和案犯是担任县处级以上领导职务的案件。上半年立案查处的这类案件比去年同期增加1.5倍，其中重大受贿案1000多件，比去年同期增加4.7倍，据统计，贪污受贿达10万元以上的有78件，其中30至50万元的8件，50万元以上的6件，最高的金额为186万元。
    最高人民检察院介绍说，各级检察机关今年上半年共立案查处贪污受贿案16000多件，比去年同期增加60％。
    据了解，最高人民检察院今年上半年已派出5名检察长和副检察长、10多名厅长、几十名处长分两批到各地办案。5月中旬，在北京处于严重动乱的情况下，最高人民检察院还召开专门会议，部署加强反贪污工作。6月中旬，他们又重点检查了10多个大城市的工作，了解有无“滑坡”现象，并发文要求各地“在坚决进行清查反革命暴乱分子的同时，一定要把反贪污受贿工作抓得很紧很紧，丝毫不能放松”。
    据介绍，目前全国各地检察机关设立的约3000个举报中心，为查处贪污受贿案起到了积极作用。有的地方出现了从一封举报信入手，连续查出20多名、30多名贪污受贿者的案子。
