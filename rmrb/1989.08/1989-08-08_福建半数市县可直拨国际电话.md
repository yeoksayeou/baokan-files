Half of Fujian's Cities and Counties Can Directly Dial International Calls

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Fuzhou on August 8th, the Fujian Provincial Communications Department revealed that by the end of June this year, 34 cities and counties in Fujian Province have achieved direct international dialing, accounting for half of the total number of cities and counties in the province.

In recent years, the number of overseas businessmen coming to Fujian to invest in factories and discuss trade has been increasing. To meet the needs of opening up to the outside world, since 1986, the Fujian Provincial Government has annually allocated a large amount of financial and material resources to accelerate the construction of communication infrastructure, especially the development of international telephone services. In the past year alone, 23 cities and counties in the province have completed the construction of international telephone projects and opened direct dialing services. Direct dialing can reach 156 countries and regions around the world.
