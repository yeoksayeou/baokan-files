Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, August 14th.

In response to the continuous rise in the dollar exchange rate on the Frankfurt market, the Deutsche Bundesbank (central bank) sold 30 million U.S. dollars on August 14th to intervene in the foreign exchange market, aiming to achieve "market balance."

On August 14th, the official average exchange rate of the dollar in the Frankfurt foreign exchange market was 1 U.S. dollar to 1.9374 West German Marks, which was higher than the previous trading day's rate of 1 U.S. dollar to 1.9305 West German Marks. The closing price for the day was 1 U.S. dollar to 1.9420 to 1.9430 West German Marks.

Local analysts believe that the significant rebound in the dollar exchange rate on the Frankfurt foreign exchange market last week was mainly due to the decline in U.S. wholesale prices in July and the increase in retail sales of goods, which are all conducive to combating inflation.

    西德银行干预外汇市场
    新华社波恩8月14日电　鉴于法兰克福市场上美元汇价不断上升，西德德意志联邦银行（中央银行）14日抛售了3000万美元干预外汇市场，以取得“市场平衡”。
    在14日的法兰克福外汇市场上，美元的官方平均汇率为1美元兑换1.9374西德马克，比上个交易日的1美元兑换1.9305西德马克又有所上升。当天的收盘价为1美元兑换1.9420至1.9430西德马克。
    此间分析家认为，上周法兰克福外汇市场上美元汇价大幅度回升，其主要原因是美国7月份的批发物价下降，商品零售额上升等，这些均有利于战胜通货膨胀。
