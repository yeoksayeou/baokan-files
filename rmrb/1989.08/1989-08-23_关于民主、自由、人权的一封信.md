Title: On Democracy, Freedom, and Human Rights: A Letter

**Editor's Note:** Recently, Comrade Li Lì'ān, Secretary of the Central Advisory Commission, wrote a letter to the central leadership, suggesting that we stand on the proletarian standpoint and use Marxist views to scientifically elucidate the issues of democracy, freedom, and human rights. The central leadership believes this suggestion is very good. Since the end of 1986, several student movements have raised the banners of democracy, freedom, and human rights. A small number of people with ulterior motives or those who plot behind the scenes aim to overthrow the Communist Party and the people's democratic dictatorship. However, the vast majority of young people lack a correct understanding of democracy, freedom, and human rights. It is now very necessary to publish some articles to systematically and scientifically elucidate these concepts and clarify various misunderstandings. This newspaper publishes Comrade Li Lì'ān's letter to draw the attention of a wide range of readers to the issues raised in the letter.

In recent times, a small number of bourgeois liberalization elements and hostile forces from abroad have made a big fuss about "democracy, freedom, and human rights," as if these things are their "patent" and their "trump card" to attack us. Many people have been misled by their propaganda and find it difficult to distinguish right from wrong, as if we have indeed lost the moral high ground in these areas.

The other day, Comrade Jiǎng Zémín said in a meeting with foreign guests: "Our Party has been established for 68 years. From the very beginning, the Party has been fighting for democracy and freedom." This statement is very inspiring. I think we should not avoid these slogans but should boldly elucidate them from a Marxist perspective, criticize the erroneous views on these issues, clarify right from wrong, educate and unite the vast majority of the people, expose and strike down the small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engage in political conspiracies, and develop true socialist democracy.

I suggest organizing some theoretical workers inside and outside the Party to seriously read some works by Marx and Lenin, deeply study the actual situations at home and abroad, and write a batch of in-depth and convincing articles. We can also adopt various forms to help the masses use Marxist class and political views to analyze the different contents and essences of democracy, freedom, and human rights under different social systems, and conduct mass self-education to untie the knots in their minds.

We Chinese Communists have nothing to be ashamed of in the areas of "democracy, freedom, and human rights." The first batch of Marxists, including Lǐ Dàzhào, Chén Dúxiù, and Máo Zédōng, raised the banners of democracy and science during the May Fourth Movement. It was precisely to realize the democracy and freedom of the Chinese proletariat and the masses that they found the truth of Marxism and founded the Communist Party of China. Over half a century, the Party has led the people in an unyielding struggle to overthrow the three big mountains, abolish unequal and rights-denying social systems, and build an independent, free, democratic, and prosperous new China. Communism not only does not contradict democracy and freedom but is also the banner guiding revolutionary people to achieve and develop democracy and freedom. Chinese Communists armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are true fighters for democracy.

Our country is a socialist people's republic, where all power belongs to the people. We have abolished the system of exploitation and established a socialist economy with public ownership as the mainstay, laying the economic foundation for people's democracy. Only on this basis have the people become the true masters of the state and society for the first time, enjoying various basic rights of democracy, freedom, and human rights within the scope of the state constitution and laws, and participating in the management of state political, economic, cultural, and all social affairs through the People's Congress system and other channels. Our democracy is fundamentally broader and superior to that of the West. Of course, we do not hide the fact that due to the short history of the establishment of the socialist system, plus the existence of system defects and mistakes in work, its superiority has not yet been fully realized. Socialist democracy and legal system are still very incomplete, and bureaucracy, corruption, and bribery are still serious. It is natural for the people to have opinions and dissatisfaction about this. But these are not inherent to the socialist system but are things that are inconsistent with or contrary to the essence of socialism and are what we are trying to solve through reform. Through reform, we will definitely make democracy and the legal system gradually and truly complete.

The "universal democracy" and "pure freedom" advocated by the Western bourgeoisie seem to be a feast that everyone can enjoy, but in reality, it is hypocritical. No matter how luxurious the Western democracy and freedom appear on the surface and how complete they are in form, they cannot escape this essence: the enjoyment of democracy and freedom is determined by the amount of money and capital one possesses. The more a few people possess, the more they enjoy; the less the majority possess, the less they enjoy. So it is nothing but money democracy and money freedom. As Lenin said, their democracy is "heaven for the rich, a trap and a swindle for the exploited, for the poor."

In this turmoil and riot, the "democracy, freedom, and human rights" advocated by Fāng Lìzhī, Yán Jiāqí, and others over the years can be said to have had a full rehearsal. What does this rehearsal show? It shows that they are completely trampling on the state's constitution and laws, despising the democratic and free rights of the vast majority. They violate the will of the Chinese people, establish illegal organizations, attack the Party and state leaders, disrupt the state's diplomatic activities, damage the state's image and reputation, disrupt the normal production, work, study, and life of the people, endanger social stability and unity, and when their conspiracies are suppressed by the martial law troops, they use horrifying brutal means to harm the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Their goal is what they publicly advocate: to implement so-called "political pluralism," "economic privatization," and "Westernization of culture" on Chinese soil. The social class they rely on domestically is the so-called "middle class" they try to create. If their scheme succeeds, the socialist system led by the Party will be overthrown, the Chinese people will fall back again, and the democratic and free rights enjoyed by the people, the fruits of the Chinese revolution, construction, and socialist reform will be completely lost. This is absolutely unacceptable to all Chinese people! We resolutely stop the turmoil and quell the riot precisely to protect the people's democracy, freedom, and human rights. Through practice and education, people will increasingly deeply understand this basic historical fact.

### 关于民主、自由、人权的一封信

    关于民主、自由、人权的一封信
    编者按：最近，中共中央顾问委员会秘书长李力安同志给中央领导同志写了一封信，建议站在无产阶级的立场上，运用马克思主义的观点，对民主、自由、人权等问题，作出科学的阐述。中央领导同志认为，这个建议很好。从1986年底开始，几次学潮都打出了要民主、自由、人权的招牌。极少数别有用心的人，或背后搞阴谋的人，其目的是要打倒共产党，推翻人民民主专政的政权。但绝大多数青年是对民主、自由、人权缺乏正确的理解。现在非常有必要发表一些文章，比较系统地、科学地阐明这些概念，澄清各种糊涂认识。本报刊登李力安同志的信，就是希望引起广大读者对信中所提问题的关注。
    最近一段时期以来，极少数资产阶级自由化分子和国外的敌对势力在“民主、自由、人权”上大做文章，仿佛这些东西成了他们的“专利品”，成了他们攻击我们的“杀手锏”。而不少群众被他们的宣传所迷惑，一时难以辨别真伪、是非，好像我们真在这些方面输了理。
    前几天，江泽民同志在会见外宾时说：“我们党成立了68年，党从一开始建立，就为民主、自由而奋斗”。读后很受启发。我觉得我们对这些口号不能回避，而是要理直气壮地对它们加以马克思主义的阐述，对在这些问题上的错误论调给予批判，以明辨是非，教育和团结绝大多数群众，揭露和打击极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人，发展真正的社会主义民主。
    建议组织一些党内外的理论工作者，围绕这些问题，认真读点马列的书，深入研究国内外的实际情况，写出一批有深度、有说服力的文章；还可以采取各种形式，帮助群众用马克思主义的阶级观点和政治观点，来分析不同社会制度下的民主、自由、人权的不同内容和实质，进行群众性的自我教育，使群众在思想上解开疙瘩。
    我们中国共产党人在“民主、自由、人权”方面没有任何理亏之处。第一批马克思主义者李大钊、陈独秀、毛泽东等人在五四运动中就高举民主、科学的旗帜。正是为了实现中国无产阶级和人民大众的民主、自由，他们才找到了马克思主义真理，创建了中国共产党。半个多世纪以来，党领导人民为推翻三座大山，废除不平等和蔑视人权的社会制度，为建设一个独立、自由、民主、富强的新中国进行了坚持不懈的斗争。共产主义不但不悖于民主、自由，而且是指引革命人民实现和发展民主、自由的胜利旗帜。马列主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党人是真正的民主斗士。
    我们的国家是社会主义的人民共和国，一切权力属于人民。我们消灭了剥削制度，建立了公有制为主体的社会主义经济，为人民民主奠定了经济基础。只有在这个基础上，人民群众才第一次成为国家和社会的真正主人，在国家宪法和法律的范围内享有民主、自由、人权的各种基本权利，并通过人民代表大会制度等途径，参与管理国家政治、经济、文化和一切社会事务。我们的民主从根本上说比西方广泛得多、优越得多。当然我们也从不隐讳，由于社会主义制度建立的历史不长，加上体制上存在着弊端和工作中发生过失误，其优越性还远未充分发挥出来，社会主义的民主、法制还很不完备，官僚主义、贪污行贿等腐败现象还严重存在，人民群众对此有意见和不满是很自然的。但这些并不是社会主义制度所固有的，而是同社会主义本质不相适应或正相违背的东西，正是我们在改革中所要努力解决的。通过改革，我们一定会使民主、法制逐步地、切实地完备起来。
    西方资产阶级奢谈的“普遍民主”、“纯粹自由”，好像是可以供人人享受的一盘西餐，实际上是虚伪的。西方的民主、自由在外表上无论多么华丽，形式上无论多么完备，总离不开这样一个实质，即享受民主、自由的多寡是以占有金钱、资本的多少为转移的。少数人占有的多，就享受的多，多数人占有的少，就享受的少。所以不过是金钱的民主，金钱的自由。正如列宁所说，他们的民主，“对富人是天堂，对被剥削者、对穷人是陷阱和骗局”。
    在这次动乱和暴乱中，方励之、严家其们几年来鼓吹的西方“民主、自由、人权”，可以说是作了一次总演习。这个演习表明了什么呢？表明了他们完全是在践踏国家的宪法和法律，蔑视绝大多数人的民主、自由权利。他们违背中国人民的意志，成立非法组织，攻击党和国家领导人，破坏国家的外交活动，损害国家的形象和声誉，破坏人民群众正常的生产、工作、学习和生活秩序，危害社会的安定团结，当他们的阴谋受到戒严部队的遏制，就使用骇人听闻的暴虐手段残害解放军战士。他们追求的目标，就是他们公开宣扬的要在中国的土地上实行所谓“政治多元化”、“经济私有化”、“文化西方化”。他们在国内依靠的社会阶级基础，就是他们想极力造成的所谓“中产阶级”。如果让他们的这一套得逞，党领导的社会主义制度就会被颠覆，中国人民就会重新沦落，人民所享有的民主、自由权利，中国革命、建设和社会主义改革的成果就会完全丧失。这当然是全体中国人民绝对不能容许的！我们坚决制止动乱和平息暴乱，正是为了保护人民的民主、自由、人权。通过实践和教育，人们将会愈来愈深刻地认识这个历史的基本事实。
                                李力安
