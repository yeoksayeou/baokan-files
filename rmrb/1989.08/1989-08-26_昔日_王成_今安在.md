Every time people hear the stirring song "Wind and smoke roll, singing heroes, the four mountains listen attentively..." they naturally think of the heroic Wang Cheng from the movie "Heroic Sons and Daughters." However, do you know where the former "Wang Cheng" is now?

On March 25, 1951, during the Korean War, a platoon of our army was tasked with defending the "212" hill to block the enemy's retreat. From 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., they repelled 19 enemy attacks at the company, battalion, and platoon levels. Out of the 13 soldiers in the platoon, 6 were killed and 6 were seriously injured, leaving only one soldier, Qin Jianbin, to continue fighting. As night fell, the enemy, seeing that there were few people on our hill, gathered their forces and charged up. Running out of bullets and grenades, Qin Jianbin suddenly remembered he had two anti-tank grenades on him. He pulled the fuse and threw them into the enemy crowd. A loud explosion followed, and the blast threw him more than ten meters away, rendering him unconscious. When he came to, he found that the enemy had left behind more than a dozen corpses and fled. His use of anti-tank grenades to blow up the enemy set a precedent that spread throughout the Korean battlefield. Many reporters interviewed him, and filmmakers also shot a documentary on the spot. After the war, he was awarded the title of First-Class National Hero. Artists also made the movie "Heroic Sons and Daughters" based on the background of the "212" blockade battle. The hero Wang Cheng in the movie is based on Qin Jianbin. However, the movie's portrayal of Wang Cheng dying with the enemy is a fictional addition by the director. Therefore, those in the know call him the "living Wang Cheng."

Qin Jianbin has been awarded 17 times for his military achievements and is a renowned old hero. After returning from the Korean War, the leadership assigned him to work in the military region headquarters, but he declined and insisted on going to the harsh island. In 1955, the troops stationed on Nanchangshan Island in the depths of the Bohai Sea, and since then, he has never left this island. The government of Qin Jianbin's hometown, Nanwang County, Hebei Province, has repeatedly urged him to return and settle down, offering him and his children comfortable jobs and spacious housing, all of which he declined. Thus, he took on the role of deputy chief of staff for the troops and deeply rooted himself on this small island. In the few years since Qin Jianbin retired, he has served as a consultant for the troops; provided advice for grassroots construction, and voluntarily became the external instructor for more than a dozen schools in the stationed area, regularly lecturing on tradition and instilling revolutionary ideals.

    昔日“王成”今安在
    “风烟滚滚唱英雄，四面青山侧耳听……”每当人们听到这首气壮山河的歌曲时，自然会想起电影《英雄儿女》中威震敌胆的英雄王成。然而，您可曾知道，昔日的“王成”今安在？
    1951年3月25日，在抗美援朝的一次战斗中，我军一个班接受了坚守“212”高地阻止敌人后逃的任务。从早晨7点到晚上8点，打退敌人营、连、排规模的进攻19次，全班13人有6人牺牲、6人重伤，唯一能坚持战斗的就剩秦建彬一名战士了。夜幕降临，敌人看我高地上人不多了，又纠集兵力蜂拥而上。子弹打光了，手榴弹扔完了，秦建彬猛然想起身上还有两根炸坦克用的爆破筒，于是把导火线一拉就投向敌群。“轰”一声巨响，气浪把他掀出十多米远，接着便不省人事了。等他苏醒过来，发现敌人丢下十几具尸体逃走了。他所创造的用爆破筒炸敌人的先例，风靡了整个朝鲜战场，有很多记者采访过他，电影制片厂的摄制人员，也在现场给他拍了纪录片。战后，他被评为一级人民英雄，文艺工作者还根据“212”阻击战背景，拍了《英雄儿女》的电影，影片中英雄王成的生活原型正是秦建彬。不过，电影中的王成与敌人同归于尽，则是编导者虚构的。所以，知情人都称他是“活着的王成”。
    秦建彬曾17次荣立战功，是位战功赫赫的老英雄，援朝归国后领导把他安排在军区机关，被他拒绝了，并执意要到艰苦的海岛去。1955年部队进驻渤海深处的长岛县南长山岛，从此他一步也不曾离开过这片岛屿。秦建彬的家乡河北省南宫县政府还多次劝他回去定居，并给他和子女安排舒适的工作、宽余的住房，这些他都一一谢绝了。就这样，他担任了部队副参谋长，在这个小岛之上深深扎下了根。秦建彬离休几年来，给部队当顾问；为基层建设献计献策，还主动担任了驻地十几所学校的校外辅导员，定期向他们宣讲传统、灌输革命道理。
