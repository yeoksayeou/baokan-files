	Stilt Houses in the South China Sea
	(and one more poem)
	Shí Chūnyuán

	Stars fall in the South China Sea
	Chess pieces are laid out on the beautiful sea
	Stilt houses seem to walk out from the heavens
	A team of skilled chess players
	Revives the rugged reefs
	Moves the pieces to set a poetic scene—
	Only then does the moon shine on the South China Sea, illuminating countless pearls
	Only then is there a gentle breeze, lazy clouds, and charming water
	Fishermen's songs are beautiful
	Stars burst, rainbows fly
	Under the warrior's heroic brow
	The national territorial waters are revealed
	The water is a piece of brocade,
	The reefs are blooming flowers
	The stilt houses have just finished weaving the divine threads
	Ah, what a magnificent scene of a dragon emerging from the water
	Chinese soldiers, with a sacred chess game,
	Place every island and reef—
	See the stilt houses standing like a platform
	Low-tide reefs
	When the sea embraces you,
	You are immersed in the whirlpool, smiling
	Saying that it is a game of hide-and-seek played by a loving mother
	Black sea moss, thick and slippery, covers you
	Let the tender moon of the south
	Gently search for the hide-and-seek without needing to retrieve
	When the sea breeze calls you back,
	Pick a bright fruit for you
	Saying that your coral branches will not sway
	The deep sea will sway tenderly
	Until the sun is shaken down
	That golden tangerine belonging to you

    南沙高脚屋
    （外一首）
    石春元
    星落南沙
    棋布秀海
    高脚屋仿佛从天阙里走来
    走一队高明的棋手
    走活了礁盘的砥砺
    举棋设下诗境——
    才见月照南沙珠万点
    才有风软云闲水妩媚
    渔歌美丽
    星爆虹飞
    战士的英武眉下
    挑开祖国的领海
    水是一匹锦缎，
    礁是朵朵花卉
    高脚屋天机唧唧刚织罢
    嗬　好一幅蛟龙出水
    中国士兵以神圣的棋局
    将每一颗岛礁布定——
    看高脚屋正擂台般挺立
    低潮礁
    海水拥抱住你时
    你沉浸在漩涡里微笑
    说那是爱子捉的迷藏
    黑海藓滑腻的厚花被覆盖
    任南国多情的月亮
    慈祥地寻找迷藏不用打捞
    海风唤回你时
    要给你摘一枚鲜亮的果子
    说你的珊瑚枝不会摆动
    大海便深情地摇曳摇曳
    直到摇落太阳
    那枚属于你的金桔
