What is the current economic situation? How can we further improve our economic work? After the decisive victory in suppressing the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, people are more concerned about these issues.

Economy is the foundation. The few individuals who plotted the turmoil and rebellion exploited our temporary economic difficulties and work errors to attempt to achieve their political goals through turmoil and rebellion. Some countries that interfere in our internal affairs also tried to create difficulties and exert pressure on our economic construction through so-called "sanctions." The huge economic losses caused by the turmoil and rebellion also made some comrades harbor certain doubts. Therefore, it is important to correctly understand the economic situation and do a good job in economic work.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's recent important speech both clearly pointed out that we must unswervingly implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress. Reform and opening up not only cannot be changed, but must be done better. Currently, in the economic field, we must continue to seriously implement the policy of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform.

There is no denying that the economic situation we face is still severe, and the task of rectification and adjustment is still arduous. We must be fully prepared for this and be ready to tighten our belts for a few years. We must not have overly high expectations or act too hastily. However, any pessimistic arguments or arguments for inaction are groundless. The eight important economic indicators recently released by the State Statistical Bureau, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China show that fixed asset investment has been initially controlled in the first half of this year, the increase in credit is less than last year, the growth of workers' wages is stabilizing, and energy-saving work has made some progress. This indicates that the rectification and adjustment in the previous period has shown results. Now, if we seize the opportunity and strive hard, we can certainly promote further improvement in the economic situation.

"Situation clear, determination strong, methods correct." Here, we propose that in the process of implementing the policy of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform, we must pay attention to grasping the key points and achieving real results.

Current economic work involves many aspects and there is much to be done. If we do not grasp the key points, we will lose our bearings and be busy without achieving anything. In fact, the key points in rectification and adjustment should be clear. We need to reduce social demand, especially to reduce the scale of investment. We need to increase effective supply, especially to improve and activate large and medium-sized enterprises, continue to improve the contract responsibility system, and create better external conditions for enterprises. We must actively carry out the "double increase, double saving" campaign and do a good job in increasing revenue and saving expenses. We must continue to curb inflation and stabilize prices. In these aspects, we not only need macro-control measures, but many places can indeed adopt some effective methods. In the circulation sector, it is necessary to seriously clean up and rectify companies, punish "official profiteering," and strengthen supervision and tax collection for individual businesses and private enterprises, which is a strong demand of the masses. It is necessary to seriously implement the state's industrial policy, and on this basis, implement preferential policies in terms of funds, taxes, and materials, and strengthen agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw material industries. This is not only necessary for the current rectification and adjustment, but also the foundation for improving economic efficiency and enhancing the momentum of the national economy. We must also strive to do a good job in opening up to the outside world, increase export earnings, and continue to improve the investment environment for foreign investors, etc. Of course, each region and department also has its own key points to focus on.

After grasping the key points, we must achieve real results. If we only stop at the surface level or remain at the level of documents and discussions, it will still be of no use. We must see that the so-called key points are not only important and urgent, but often the difficult points in the work. Therefore, without a great determination, without a great effort, and without a persistent spirit, it is difficult to achieve real results.

To achieve real results, we must strengthen supervision and inspection, and resolutely uphold the seriousness of national plans and policies. For example, some places adopt a passive attitude towards reducing the scale of investment, and even take advantage of the previous turmoil to "revive" the halted projects, which should be criticized and dealt with.

To achieve real results, we must also pay attention to timely research on new situations and solving new problems. The implementation of rectification measures requires a thorough understanding of the situation and a comprehensive assessment of its effects. We must track its practical effects and make necessary adjustments in a timely manner, and supplement supporting measures. The price increases of famous cigarettes and liquors, and the exclusive sales of color TVs, etc., have provided us with lessons in this regard.

Emphasizing the grasp of key points and achieving real results is actually advocating a pragmatic spirit. As long as we unite as one, adhere to the party's basic line, work hard and steadily, and move forward step by step, even if we develop steadily for several decades, China will undergo fundamental changes. There are many debatable issues in economic theory, and it is not necessary to spend too much energy on this at present. The most important thing is to focus our energy on the principles and policies already determined by the Central Committee, and to do a few practical things that make the people happy. If we make use of the remaining time this year to achieve greater results in rectification and adjustment, and actually complete the task of rectification and adjustment in two or three years, then our reform and opening up and the cause of socialist modernization will have more hope. Practical work produces results, and practical work is also conducive to social stability. The profound truth in this is worth serious understanding.

    抓住重点  抓出实效
    ——谈继续认真贯彻治理整顿深化改革方针
    本报评论员
    当前经济形势如何？怎样进一步做好经济工作？在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利之后，人们更加关切这些问题。
    经济是基础。策划动乱和暴乱的极少数人，正是利用我国经济上的暂时困难和工作上的失误，妄图通过动乱和暴乱达到自己的政治目的。少数干涉我国内政的那些国家，也企图通过所谓“制裁”给我国经济建设制造困难，施加压力。动乱和暴乱造成的巨大经济损失，也使一些同志增加了某些疑虑。因此，正确认识经济形势，做好经济工作，具有重要意义。
    党的十三届四中全会和邓小平同志最近的重要讲话都明确指出，我们一定要坚定不移地执行党的十一届三中全会路线、方针、政策和十三大确定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线。改革、开放不仅不能变，而且要搞得更好。当前，在经济领域，则要继续认真贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针。
    毋庸讳言，我们面临的经济形势还是严峻的，治理整顿任务还很艰巨。对此我们一定要有足够的思想准备，一定要树立过几年紧日子的思想，不可期望过高、操之过急。但是，任何悲观的论点、无所作为的论点，都是没有根据的。国家统计局、国家计委、财政部和中国人民银行最近公布的八项重要经济指标显示，今年上半年固定资产投资已获初步控制，信贷增加额小于去年，职工工资增长趋向平稳，节能工作有所进展。这说明，前一段的治理整顿已显出成效。现在我们乘势努力，完全有可能促使经济状况进一步好转。
      “情况明，决心大，方法对”。这里我们提出，在贯彻治理整顿、深化改革方针过程中，一定要注意抓住重点，抓出实效。
    当前的经济工作千头万绪，百事待兴。如果抓不住重点，就会乱了章法，忙而无功。事实上，治理整顿中的重点应该说是明确的。要压缩社会需求，特别要压缩投资规模。要增加有效供给，特别是搞好搞活大中型企业，继续完善承包制并为企业创造更好的外部条件。积极开展“双增双节”运动，大力做好增收节支工作。继续努力遏制通货膨胀，稳定物价。在这些方面，不仅要靠宏观上的调控措施，而且许多地方的确可以采取一些行之有效的方法。在流通领域，认真清理整顿公司、惩治“官倒”，加强对个体户、私人企业的监督和税收征管工作，更是群众的强烈要求。认真执行国家产业政策，据此在资金、税收、物资等方面实行倾斜政策，切实加强农业，加强能源、交通和原材料工业，不仅为目前治理整顿所必需，而且是提高经济效益、增强国民经济后劲的基础条件。还要努力抓好对外开放工作，大力增加出口创汇，继续改善外商投资环境，等等。当然，各地区、各部门也还有自己需要抓的重点。
    抓住了重点，还必须抓出实效。如果只是点到为止，或停留在文件上、议论上，那仍然是没有用的。必须看到，所谓重点，既是重要、紧迫的关节之处，又往往是工作中的难点。因此，不下大决心，不花大力气，没有始终一贯、锲而不舍的精神，是难以抓出实效来的。
    为了抓出实效，就必须加强督促、检查，坚决维护国家计划和政策的严肃性。例如有的地方对压缩投资规模采取消极观望的态度，甚至趁前段动乱之机让已停建的工程“死灰复燃”，就应该进行批评和处理。
    为了抓出实效，还必须注意及时研究新情况，解决新问题。贯彻落实整治措施，必须周密地了解情况，全面估计它的效应。要跟踪它的实践效果，并及时作出必要调整，补充配套措施。名烟名酒提价、彩电专营等等，已为我们提供了这方面的经验教训。
    强调抓住重点、抓出实效，实际上是提倡务实精神。只要团结一致，坚持党的基本路线，扎扎实实地干，一步一个脚印地前进，即使是平平稳稳发展几十年，中国也会发生根本变化。经济理论上可争论的问题很多，当前没有必要在这方面花很大精力。最重要的是按照中央已确定的方针政策，聚精会神、实实在在地干几件让人民高兴的实事。如果我们利用今年剩下的时间，在治理整顿上抓出更大的实效，在两三年内确实完成了治理整顿的任务，那么我们的改革开放和社会主义现代化建设事业就会更有希望。实干出成效，实干也才有利于社会稳定。这其中的深刻道理，是需要认真领会的。
