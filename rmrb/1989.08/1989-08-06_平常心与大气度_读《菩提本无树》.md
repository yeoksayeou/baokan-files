When I read Huang Hongdi's essays, I often find myself standing or walking, unable to sit still at my desk. I always think of the intense sun and strong winds of Hainan, of a knight-errant, of a wandering spirit, and even of Shih Hsiu from "Water Margin." I may never be able to write like him (I couldn't write like that even if I tried), but I do enjoy his writing. From his essays, I gain many insights.

If "composure" is applied to the creation of essays, it will surely open up new realms. Originally, composure is the most fundamental aspect of human nature, but writers often lose it when they are "being literary." This phenomenon is truly a kind of mystery in writing. Emphasizing composure is to fully enjoy the art of life and to thoroughly relax the tension of writing. After essays have the most sincere emotions as their basic requirement, they have no further demands. Seeing the beauty or the flaws of life and finding fulfillment in this beauty and these flaws as a kind of human enjoyment, this is how art is born. If one insists on writing something that "resembles an essay," it will end up not resembling an essay at all. The trouble lies in the word "resemble." The insistence on "resemblance" prevents one from truly experiencing life, and the writing will then be stiff and affected.

Generally, writing avoids being mundane, but if one tries too hard to be out of the ordinary, one will end up being ordinary again, that is, being grandly ordinary. Lao She is such a master. One of the reasons for the current society's indifference towards essays is that essays deliberately try to be out of the ordinary. Those who write essays are influenced by famous works of the past and present, mistakenly believing that essays should have a poetic quality, a sense of leisure and idle thoughts, and deliberately avoiding any trace of life, turning them into exquisite trifles. In this vast world, there are still countless ordinary people besides those reclusive scholars, and there is still a chaotic life besides the clear and tranquil streams. Emphasizing being out of the ordinary and then returning to the ordinary is to liberate essays from their old frameworks of thought, making essays also produce an epic flavor. After being able to comprehensively experience life, one can also transcend and stand above, grasping the structure and rhythm of the work. Insisting on being refined, chewing on small themes, small poetic sentiments, and small philosophies, will inevitably degenerate into petty-mindedness. Zhang Dai commented on "Water Margin's" Chao Gai as "a bandit who robs and plunders, with the bearing of an emperor," which is enlightening for essays. It is better to write without being too refined, but with a grand bearing.

    平常心与大气度
    ——读《菩提本无树》
    贾平凹
    我读黄宏地的散文，差不多是站着走着，坐不稳到书桌前，总想起海南的太阳很大，风很硬，想起一个侠士，想起浪人，甚至想起《水浒》上的那个石秀来。我或许永远也不会像他这样写文章（我也写不出），但我却喜欢他的文章，从他的文章中读出许多启示。
      “平常心”，如果引进于散文的创作，必须会有新的境界。原本是人之最基本的东西，文人在作“文人”的时候却常失却，这种现象真要是文章的一种玄妙了。强调平常心，为的是能充分地享受到生活的艺术，且彻底地放松写作时的紧张。散文在有了最真挚的感情作为最起码的要求之后，它是再无要求的，在看到人生的美好或看到人生的残缺而在这美好与残缺中完满自己作为人的一种享受，这便产生了艺术。一定要写出个“像个散文”却终写出的不像个散文，原因就在这个“像”字。“要像”的作祟，就不能真心身地感受生活，行文也就拿架子。
    一般来说，作文都忌落俗，殊不知出俗到一定的程度则要入俗，即大俗。大俗者大雅。老舍先生便是这样的大家。时下社会对散文的冷漠，其中一大原因是散文刻意在出俗。习作散文的人受古今一些名篇的影响，误认为是所谓散文便是一种山水抒情品格，是要有一种诗意，一种逸情和闲思，进而刻意到找不着一丝生活气息，成了精美的玩意。大千的世上，是还有别于那些清静逸士之外的芸芸众生，有别于那些高山流水之外的混沌生活的。强调出了俗再入俗，为的是解放散文旧的框式的思维，使散文也产生出史诗的意味，且在能整体地感受生活之后也更能超越而出来高居把握作品的结构和气韵。一味地要雅，咀嚼小意境和小诗意以及小哲理，必是退化到鸡肠小肚。张岱评《水浒》中的晁盖是“盗贼草劫，帝王气象”，此话对散文倒有启发，宁可写得不精致，却要大气度。
