Title: The U.S. Manufacturing Industry's "Renaissance" Comes at an Inopportune Time

Once dubbed the "Rust Belt," the U.S. manufacturing industry saw a notable "revival" three years ago, once again becoming the driving force behind U.S. economic growth. This injected new vitality into the U.S. economy, which was then facing turmoil in the financial markets and a sluggish real estate market. At the time, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter excitedly pointed out that U.S. manufacturing was on the verge of a new birth and would become one of the most successful economic sectors in the coming decades. He even asserted that with the rapid development of manufacturing, the U.S. would soon change its status as a trade deficit country.

However, the situation did not entirely unfold as Yeutter had hoped. Recently, data released by the National Association of Purchasing Management indicated that by the end of July, manufacturing production had declined for three consecutive months, and manufacturing orders had dropped to their lowest level since 1982. Clearly, this is an ominous sign.

Indeed, this revival of U.S. manufacturing was not due to short-term, accidental factors. Since 1982, when the U.S. emerged from its economic crisis, it began implementing large-scale industrial revitalization plans: on one hand, accelerating structural adjustments within the industrial sector and actively developing new high-tech industries, and on the other, comprehensively adjusting industrial policies to promote the growth of fixed capital investment. After nearly four years of adjustment, starting in 1987, U.S. manufacturing showed signs of recovery.

However, to maintain long-term prosperity in manufacturing, relying solely on internal adjustments within the industry is not enough. Indeed, the "boom" in U.S. manufacturing has not been sustained for a long period, largely because the "external economic environment" has not provided the conditions necessary for the long-term, sustained development of manufacturing. Internationally, the economic growth of other Western developed countries has slowed in recent years, and trade protectionism has risen, making it more difficult for U.S. manufacturing products to be exported. In the Third World, Latin American countries are burdened with heavy debt, and economic growth in African countries has stagnated, which has to some extent suppressed market demand. Domestically, the most significant impact on manufacturing has been the decline in consumer demand: personal consumption has decreased; the federal government has reduced or canceled large military orders to cut the massive fiscal deficit; and the monetary authorities have implemented tight monetary policies to curb inflation, all of which have had adverse effects on the development of manufacturing.

People believe that whether U.S. manufacturing can quickly reverse its downward trend and avoid another decline depends on changes in the overall U.S. economic situation and whether the U.S. can delay the threat of a new economic crisis.

### 美国制造业“兴”不逢时

    美国制造业“兴”不逢时
    孙毅
    曾经被称作“生锈地带”的美国制造业，三年前出现了引人注目的“复兴”，再次成为支撑美国经济增长的主导因素。这为当时处在金融市场混乱、房地产市场不振形势下的美国经济注入了新的活力。当时的美国贸易代表尤特曾颇为兴奋地指出，美国的制造业正处在新生的边缘，在今后的十几年中，它将成为美国获得最大成功的经济部门之一。他甚至断言，随着制造业的迅速发展，美国将在不远的将来改变贸易逆差国的地位。
    然而，形势并未完全按尤特的良好愿望发展。日前，美国全国采购经理协会发布的一项数字表明，到七月底止，制造业生产已连续三个月下降，制造业的订单亦降至一九八二年以来的最低水平。显然，这是一个不祥的讯号。
    不错，此次美国制造业的复兴，并非短期的偶然因素所致。美国自一九八二年以来摆脱经济危机之后，即开始实施大规模的产业复兴计划：一方面加速工业部门内部的结构性调整，积极发展新兴的高技术产业，另一方面又全面调整产业政策，促进固定资本投资的增长。经过近四年的调整，自一九八七年开始，美国的制造业重现了复苏的生机。
    但是要保持制造业的长期繁荣，仅仅依靠制造业本身的内部调整是不够的。事实也是如此，美国制造业的“景气”未能较长时期保持，很大程度上是因为“外部的经济环境”未能提供保证制造业长期持续发展的条件。从国际方面来看，近几年西方其它发达国家经济增长缓慢，贸易保护主义抬头，加重了美国制造业产品出口的困难；第三世界国家中，拉美债务负担沉重、非洲国家经济增长停滞，也在一定程度上抑制了市场需求。从国内看，对制造业影响最大的消费需求出现下降趋势：个人消费下降；联邦政府为削减庞大财政赤字而减少或取消大批军事定货；货币当局为抑制通货膨胀实行紧缩政策，这都为制造业发展造成不利影响。
    人们认为，今后美国制造业能否迅速扭转下降趋势，避免再度衰落，取决于美国整个经济形势的变化和美国能否延缓新一轮经济危机的威胁。
