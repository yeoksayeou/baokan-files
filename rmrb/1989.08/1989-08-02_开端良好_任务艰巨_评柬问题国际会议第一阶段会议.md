A Good Start, Arduous Task Ahead
– Evaluating the First Phase of the International Conference on the Cambodian Issue

The three-day ministerial-level meeting was the first phase of the international conference. Ending the war of aggression against Cambodia and achieving national reconciliation are the primary goals of this conference on the Cambodian issue. After discussions, the conference unanimously adopted the organizational working document, aiming to produce a "peace agreement" on the Cambodian issue by the end of this month. This step has received widespread attention and welcome from the international community.

According to the agreed working document, under the guidance of the conference coordinating committee, three specialized working committees and one special committee will simultaneously work on various aspects of politically resolving the Cambodian issue. This organizational working procedure reflects that the conference has achieved two significant results.

Firstly, the principle of comprehensively solving the Cambodian issue has been widely recognized. During the preparation for this conference, people clearly saw two different plans for politically solving the Cambodian issue: comprehensive solution and partial solution. Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime insisted on the latter, attempting to disguise its "Vietnamization" of Cambodia with the formality of troop withdrawal. ASEAN and other countries advocated for a comprehensive solution, starting from the reality of Cambodia, demanding that after the Vietnamese troops genuinely withdraw, every effort should be made to avoid civil war. Although this conference did not directly adopt some countries' proposal to establish a fourth working committee, the conference decided to set up a special committee to study the establishment of a temporary power structure led by Sihanouk, thereby bringing the comprehensive solution plan to the conference's work agenda. This is a notable result.

Secondly, the international supervision mechanism has been placed under the United Nations. From the speeches and working documents of this conference, it is evident that in major issues such as troop withdrawal, ceasefire, foreign aid, and elections, the supervisory role of the United Nations has received due attention. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar personally attended the conference, and his suggestion to immediately dispatch an investigation team to Cambodia to carry out investigation tasks was widely accepted. In the past, Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime had firmly resisted the United Nations, but most of the representatives present believed that the UN's supervision mechanism is an effective measure to promote the Cambodian peace process.

It should be acknowledged that this conference has achieved better results than expected. The comprehensive solution plan has prevailed because more people have come to understand the essence of the Cambodian issue; the disasters and divisions that the Cambodian people have suffered for many years are ultimately caused by the Vietnamese invasion. Therefore, people strongly demand the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and also demand the resolution of internal conflicts and discord caused by the Vietnamese invasion. The partial solution plan envisioned by the Vietnamese, aiming to "walk away," is becoming increasingly unfeasible.

The international climate has provided favorable conditions for solving the Cambodian issue. Generally, the atmosphere of this conference is good. Although some difficulties and disputes were encountered, under the guidance of a pragmatic and reconciliatory spirit, and with the patient and enthusiastic mediation of the two conference chairpersons, through intense and frequent consultations, the conference's working document was finally reached.

The lessons from Afghanistan are worth noting. Including the Soviet Foreign Minister, some representatives mentioned that the internal war in Afghanistan should not be repeated in Cambodia. Afghanistan is a mirror, showing that without an effective international supervision mechanism, even the withdrawal of foreign troops cannot guarantee the stability of the situation, and peace cannot be achieved. Prince Sihanouk repeatedly emphasized that excluding one party will inevitably lead to the outbreak of civil war, and this logic has been accepted by more people.

Now, people generally believe that the international conference on the Cambodian issue has had a good start, but the more arduous task lies ahead. From the results of the four-party round-table conference, some people's evaluation of the Khmer Rouge, and the observation of Vietnam's insincerity, it is clear that the process of Cambodian peace is still filled with struggle. Currently, the second phase of the conference, the committee meetings, is underway. People are looking forward to the conference overcoming obstacles and continuing to make progress. For the Paris conference to achieve truly satisfactory results, undoubtedly, more patience and wisdom are needed.

### 开端良好　任务艰巨——评柬问题国际会议第一阶段会议

    开端良好　任务艰巨
    ——评柬问题国际会议第一阶段会议
    本报记者　张启华　吕网大
    为期三天的部长级会议是国际会议的第一阶段。结束侵柬战争、实现民族和解是这次柬埔寨问题国际会议的首要目标。经过讨论，会议一致通过了组织工作文件，争取在本月底产生一个柬埔寨问题的“和平协议”，这一步骤受到国际社会普遍的重视和欢迎。
    根据达成的工作文件，在会议协调委员会的指导下，三个专门工作委员会和一个特设委员会将分别就政治解决柬埔寨问题的几个方面同时开展工作。这一组织工作程序，体现了这次会议取得了两项明显的结果。
    首先，全面解决柬埔寨问题的原则已得到了普遍的认可。在筹备这次会议的过程中，人们明显地看到两种不同的政治解决柬埔寨问题的方案，即全面解决和部分解决方案。越南和金边政权坚持后者，企图以形式上的撤军掩饰它的柬埔寨“越南化”的真面目。东盟和其它一些国家则主张全面解决，它们从柬埔寨的现实出发，要求在越南军队真正撤出后，想方设法避免内战。这次会议虽然没有直接采纳一些国家提出的组建第四个工作委员会的建议，但会议决定成立特设委员会、研究成立一个以西哈努克为首的四方临时权力机构，从而使全面解决的方案提到了会议的工作日程，这是一项引人注目的结果。
    其次，国际监督机制已落到联合国身上。人们从这次会议的发言和工作文件看到，在涉及撤军、停火、外援、选举等一些重大问题上，联合国的监督作用受到了应有的重视。联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔亲自出席会议，他提出的立即派遣调查组前往柬埔寨行使调查任务的建议也被普遍接受。过去越南和金边政权是坚决抵制联合国的，但大多数与会代表都认为联合国的监督机制是推动柬埔寨和平进程的有效措施。
    应该承认，这次会议取得了比人们预料要好的结果。全面解决方案占了上风，这是因为更多的人认识到柬埔寨问题的实质；柬埔寨人民多年来遭受的灾难、分裂，说到底是由越南入侵造成的。因此，人们强烈要求越南撤军，同时也要求解决由越南入侵后引起的内部冲突和不和。越南人设想的“一走了之”的部分解决方案越来越行不通了。
    国际大气候为解决柬问题提供了有利条件。总的说这次会议的气氛是不错的。虽然遇到了某些困难和争执，但在求实、和解精神支配下，在会议两主席耐心、热情的斡旋下，通过紧张频繁的磋商终于达成了会议的工作文件。
    阿富汗的教训值得记取，包括苏联外长在内，一些代表都提到不允许阿富汗的内战在柬埔寨重演。阿富汗是一面镜子，它说明没有行之有效的国际监督机制，即使撤出外国军队也无法确保局势的稳定，和平也无从谈起。西哈努克亲王多次反复强调，排斥一方的做法，势必导致内战的爆发，这个道理已为更多的人所接受。
    现在人们都认为，柬埔寨问题国际会议已有了一个好的开端，更艰巨的任务还在后头，从四方圆桌会议的结果，一些人对红色高棉的评价，以及考察越南口是心非的表现，都说明柬埔寨和平的进程仍然充满斗争。目前，会议第二阶段的工作，即委员会会议正在进行，人们期待着会议能克服阻力，继续取得进展。巴黎会议要取得真正的令人满意的成果，无疑还需要更大的耐心和更多的智慧。
