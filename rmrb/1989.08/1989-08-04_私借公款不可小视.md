The Seriousness of Employees Borrowing Public Funds

Currently, a tight financial situation has become one of the main factors constraining economic development, with some enterprises even forced to halt production due to financial difficulties. A direct cause of this is the high occupation and slow turnover of enterprise funds, among which the serious issue of employees defaulting on public funds cannot be overlooked.

Recently, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Jilin Provincial Branch conducted a survey of 140,000-plus enterprises and institutions involving 2.17 million employees. The results showed that 243,000 people had defaulted on public funds, amounting to 217 million yuan, which is equivalent to 47.2% of the total loan increase in Jilin Province from January to April this year. The consequences of employees defaulting on a large amount of public funds are extremely serious: on one hand, enterprises have reduced their available funds, exacerbating the tight liquidity situation, and each year they have to pay 27.6 million yuan in loan interest. On the other hand, it leads to low efficiency in the use of working capital, correspondingly reducing national fiscal revenue.

According to the analysis, the scope of employees' defaults is quite broad, often involving both enterprises and government institutions and public organizations; procurement staff default, and some leaders also default; in some units, all employees have defaults. There are more than a dozen types of defaults, with the main ones being business trip loans, medical fee loans, and housing purchase loans. The default periods are generally long, with a considerable amount of defaults lasting 3 to 5 years or more, and some even reaching 10 years.

According to Zhang Mingsheng, Chief Economist of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Jilin Provincial Branch, the reasons for the significant increase in employees defaulting on public funds are as follows: first, financial management is chaotic, and financial systems are not sound; second, supervision measures are weak, rules are not followed, and the binding force of regulations and systems is lost; third, leaders lead by example in defaulting, objectively playing a negative guiding role and causing people to follow suit in borrowing; fourth, discipline and law enforcement are lax, and there is a lack of effective measures to recover debts.

### 私借公款不可小视

    私借公款不可小视
    当前资金紧张已成为制约经济发展的主要因素之一，一些企业甚至因资金紧张而被迫停产。企业资金占用多、周转慢是一个直接原因，其中职工拖欠公款严重也不可小视。
    最近，工商银行吉林省分行对1.4万多个企事业单位的217万职工进行调查，结果发现有24.3万人拖欠公款，金额达2.17亿元，竟相当于今年1至4月吉林全省贷款增加额的47.2％。职工大量拖欠公款带来的后果极其严重：一方面企业减少了可用资金，加剧了流动资金的紧张状况，每年还要支付2760万元的贷款利息。另一方面，造成流动资金使用效益低，相应减少了国家财政收入。
    据分析，职工欠款现在欠款范围较广，常常是企业欠，机关事业单位也欠；采购员欠，一些领导干部也欠；有的单位全体职工都有欠款。欠款名目多达十几种，公出借款、医疗费借款、建房购房借款则是主要名目。欠款的时间一般都较长，有相当数额的欠款在3至5年以上，有的甚至达10年之久。
    据中国工商银行吉林省分行总经济师张明圣分析，形成职工拖欠公款大量增加的原因，一是财务管理混乱，财务制度不健全；二是监督措施不力，有规不循，失去了规章制度的约束性；三是领导带头欠款，客观上起了劣性诱导作用，引起群众攀比借款；四是法纪松弛，清欠缺乏有效手段。
