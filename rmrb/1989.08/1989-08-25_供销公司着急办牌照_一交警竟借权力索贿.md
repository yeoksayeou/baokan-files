    On July 14, the People's Procuratorate of Anlu City, Hubei Province, discovered during the investigation of a reported case that Feng Yong, a staff member of the Safety Section of the Traffic Police Brigade of the Public Security Bureau of Xiaogan Region, had engaged in extortion. The procuratorate immediately initiated a criminal investigation.

    The investigation revealed that in late June of the previous year, Tao Huaming and other employees of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Light Industry Bureau of Anlu City went to Feng Yong to request assistance in obtaining a car license plate. Feng said, "Obtaining a license plate is both difficult and not difficult. You should first get me a genuine 18-inch Japanese-made color television." A few days later, Feng called to urge them. On July 17 of the same year, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative spent 2,990 yuan to purchase a Toshiba 18-inch color television, which was delivered directly to Feng Yong's home by Tao Huaming and Chen Guangfa. At this point, Feng Yong demanded 3,000 yuan in cash. On July 18, Feng Yong drove to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to collect the money. After negotiations, Feng agreed to reduce the amount to 2,000 yuan, then he stuffed the money into his car and drove away.

    After the case was exposed, a 18-inch color television and 1,400 yuan in cash were seized from Feng Yong's home. On August 5, Feng Yong was arrested.

    供销公司着急办牌照  一交警竟借权力索贿
    7月14日，湖北安陆市人民检察院在调查一起举报案件时，发现孝感地区公安处交警支队安全科干部冯勇有索贿行为，便立案侦查。
    结果查明，去年6月下旬，安陆市轻工业局供销公司职工陶华明等人到冯勇处，要求帮忙办理轿车牌照。冯说：“办牌照说难也难，说不难也不难，你们先给我搞一台日本产18英寸原装彩电。”没过几天，冯就打电话催。同年7月17日，供销公司花2990元买了1台东芝牌18英寸彩电，由陶华明、陈光发直接送到冯勇家里。这时冯勇又提出要现金3000元。7月18日，冯勇开车专门赶到供销公司要款。经协商，冯同意降到2000元，然后，他将钱塞进车内扬长而去。
    案发后，从冯勇家里搜缴18英寸彩电1台，现金1400元，8月5日，冯勇已被逮捕。
