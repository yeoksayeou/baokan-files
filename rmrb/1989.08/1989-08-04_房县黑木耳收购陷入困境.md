Fang County in Hubei Province is a major production base for black wood ear mushrooms in China. This year, the county has seen a bumper harvest of black wood ear mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms. By the beginning of June, the county had produced 345,000 kilograms of black wood ear mushrooms and 83,000 kilograms of fragrant mushrooms, both of which were more than double the amount produced in the same period last year, setting a new record for the same period in history. However, due to a shortage of funds, the county's supply and marketing cooperatives were only able to procure 224,200 kilograms of black wood ear mushrooms and 50,000 kilograms of fragrant mushrooms. Among these, 1.07 million yuan worth of procurement was done through issuing IOUs, which seriously affected the procurement and sales of black wood ear mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms, dampening the enthusiasm of farmers for production. At the same time, due to a shortage of social funds, the supply and marketing cooperatives also faced difficulties in allocating and selling black wood ear mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms. Currently, the supply and marketing cooperatives have 200,000 kilograms of black wood ear mushrooms and 67,500 kilograms of fragrant mushrooms in stock, tying up more than 8 million yuan in funds.

The county's supply and marketing cooperatives have taken emergency measures, such as using fertilizers, plastic film, pesticides, and daily necessities to exchange for black wood ear mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms, but these measures have not been able to solve the severe shortage of funds in the procurement and sales of black wood ear mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms. According to the county's supply and marketing cooperatives, it is estimated that the county will produce approximately 900,000 kilograms of black wood ear mushrooms and 150,000 kilograms of fragrant mushrooms this year, and farmers are quite worried.

Relevant departments should actively help Fang County's supply and marketing cooperatives solve the problem of issuing IOUs for the procurement of black wood ear mushrooms and fragrant mushrooms, so as to ensure the timely procurement of agricultural and sideline products and stimulate the enthusiasm of farmers for production.

    房县黑木耳收购陷入困境
    湖北省房县是全国黑木耳生产基地，今年黑木耳、香菌喜获丰收。到6月上旬，全县已产黑木耳34.5万公斤、香菌8.3万公斤，分别比去年同期增长1倍多，创历史同期最高水平。但由于资金紧缺，县供销部门只收购黑木耳22.42万公斤、香菌5万公斤。其中，收购打白条107万元，严重影响了黑木耳、香菌的收购与销售工作，挫伤了农民的生产积极性。同时，由于社会资金紧缺，供销部门调拨、销售黑木耳和香菌的工作也很困难，供销部门现库存黑木耳20万公斤、香菇6.75万公斤，占压资金达800多万元。
    县供销部门虽然采取了应急措施：如用化肥、地膜、农药及生活用品等换购黑木耳、香菌等，但仍然解决不了黑木耳、香菌购销中资金严重紧缺的困境。据县供销部门反映，今年预计全县黑木耳约产90万公斤，香菌达15万公斤，农民十分忧虑。
    有关部门应积极帮助房县供销部门解决黑木耳、香菌收购打白条的问题，以保障农副产品的及时收购，调动农民的生产积极性。湖北郧阳地委办公室
