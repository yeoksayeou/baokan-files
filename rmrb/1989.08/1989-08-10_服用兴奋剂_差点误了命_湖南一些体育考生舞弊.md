    Taking Stimulants Almost Cost Them Their Lives
    Some Sports Exam Candidates in Hunan Cheat

    New China News Agency reporter Shítāo and People's Daily reporter Dùruǒyuán report from Changsha: Before the provincial sports specialty retest this year, some sports exam candidates in Hunan took prohibited drugs like caffeine to improve their performance, causing a very bad influence.

    On the morning of May 27, four students from Lianyuan City's No. 4 Middle School took caffeine before the track and field specialty test without authorization. Due to their lack of knowledge about pharmacology, the four students had not finished the test when they started feeling dizzy and nauseous. They were then rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Only after repeated questioning by the doctors did they reluctantly reveal the truth.

    According to the sports recruitment inspection team dispatched by the provincial education commission, there were also cases of students taking stimulants in other regions. The retest results of some sports candidates were surprisingly higher than their initial test results.

    Professor Lěi Zhìzào of Hunan Normal University's Department of Physical Education said that there is evidence that some sports candidates in Hunan had taken stimulants to improve their scores and gain admission to universities as early as 1985.

    After the incident of some sports candidates taking stimulants was exposed, the Hunan Provincial Admissions Office immediately decided to issue disciplinary requirements to candidates who have not yet been tested: if such incidents occur again, the candidates' qualifications and test scores will be canceled without hesitation.

    On July 3, the Lianyuan City Admissions Office made an initial decision on the cheating behavior of the four students from the city.

    服用兴奋剂  差点误了命
    湖南一些体育考生舞弊
    本报长沙电　新华社记者石涛、本报记者杜若原报道：湖南省一些体育考生在参加今年全省体育专业复试之前，为提高运动成绩服用咖啡因等违禁药品，造成很坏影响。
    5月27日上午，涟源市四中的四名考生在参加田径专项测试前，擅自服用咖啡因。由于不懂药理知识，四人尚未考完，就因药力发作导致晕头转向，并发生呕吐现象。随后，被送到医院抢救治疗。在医生再三追问下，他们才吞吞吐吐地道出原委。
    据省教委派出的体育招考巡视员介绍，其它地区的考生也有服用兴奋剂的问题。部分体育考生复试成绩比初试成绩高得惊人。
    湖南师大体育系的雷志灶副教授说，有证据表明，湖南的个别体育考生1985年就有通过服用兴奋剂提高成绩而考入大学的。
    一些体育考生服用兴奋剂一事败露后，湖南省招生办当即决定，对尚未测试的考生提出纪律要求：一旦此类情况再度发生，将坚决取消考生资格和考试成绩。
      7月3日，涟源市招生办对该市四名考生服药的舞弊行为作出了初步处理。
