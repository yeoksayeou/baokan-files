In the early post-war period, Japanese people generally felt a sense of loss. As the economy recovered, scholars proposed the idea of combining democracy, technological civilization, and traditional culture.

On September 20, 1949, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, told reporters in Tokyo: "Because of this war, Japan has been reduced to a fourth-rate country." Indeed, defeat not only caused Japan significant losses in national strength but also made most Japanese citizens feel a sense of loss. Faced with the influx of American civilization, which was so different from their own traditions, people were terrified and confused. The image of the nation in people's minds plummeted, and a sense of national nihilism spread. Just as during the Meiji Restoration, when some people advocated making English the national language of Japan and encouraging Japanese women to marry foreigners to change the Japanese race, in the post-war ruins, Westernization theories resurfaced. Writer Hisamatsu Seigo wrote in *Sekai Shunju* (World Spring and Autumn), advocating that Japan become a state of the United States...

In the early post-war period, Japanese people paid particular attention to how the outside world viewed them. Ruth Benedict's *The Chrysanthemum and the Sword* (1946), translated into Japanese in 1948, became a bestseller. Many people tried to understand themselves through this book. After comparing Japanese culture with European and American cultures, Benedict proposed two concepts: "collectivism" and "shame culture." She believed that unlike the individualism prevalent in Europe and America, in Japan, "collectivism" functioned as a principle of social organization. Within this collective, everyone clearly understood their position in society; the hierarchical system based on the family structure determined people's thinking and behavior.

"Shame culture" explained the phenomenon where Japanese people felt shame when publicly ridiculed or rejected. Therefore, everyone paid great attention to public opinion about their behavior and often used others' judgments as the basis for determining their own actions.

Benedict's analysis of the "types" of Japanese culture had a decisive influence on people's understanding of Japanese culture. In the eyes of some Japanese, these characteristics of Japanese culture were the reasons for Japan's failure in modernization. In May 1949, scholar Kawashima Takeo wrote in *Minzokugaku Zasshi* (Journal of Ethnology): "This book's depiction and analysis of our lives have exposed our ugly side to the world, forcing us to reflect deeply."

In the post-war cultural reflection trend, Kawashima Takeo also wrote *The Family Principle in Japanese Society* (1948), arguing that Japanese society was composed of families and the way families were combined. This familialism principle was opposed to the democratic principle, and without negating it, Japan could not achieve democratization.

As Osaka University professor Aoki Yasushi put it, at that time, Kawashima's view had almost become the most basic common sense among Japanese intellectuals.

In the early post-war period, Kato Shichi and other scholars also began to reflect on and criticize traditional culture. He first targeted the imperial system, advocating the absorption of Western culture. In his view, Japan's traditions were all feudal, while everything in the West represented democracy and science.

The Korean War broke out, stimulating Japan's economic recovery. In the mid-1950s, Japan's economy experienced what was called the "Jinmu Boom," and Japanese confidence gradually recovered. Thus, in 1956, someone wrote in the *Economic White Paper*: "Now it is no longer the post-war era." That year, Japan joined the United Nations and restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Japan re-entered the international community.

Tradition, though not as good as people imagined, is also not as bad as people imagined. Moreover, whether one likes it or not, tradition is ultimately the foundation for a nation's revival.

Corresponding to the gradual improvement of political and economic situations, people began to re-examine the issue of "negating tradition," and new perspectives on Japanese traditional culture emerged.

In October 1957, Kato Shichi proposed that "Japan's modernization can only take the form of combining democracy, technological civilization, and Japanese traditional culture." He believed that post-war Japanese people, by combining their national cultural traditions with Western democracy and science, promoted economic development.

Almost at the same time, the director of the National Museum of Ethnology, Umesao Tadao, published an article titled *The Ecological View of Civilization*. This article had a significant influence in Japan in the late 1950s. The article proposed that Japanese civilization and Western civilization were in a state of "parallel evolution." He believed that Japan and the West were at opposite ends of the Eurasian continent, and the two had surprising similarities in ecological environment and historical evolution. Umesao Tadao completely rejected the idea that Japan was following and imitating the West, fully demonstrating his confidence in his own traditional culture.

In the 1960s, some intellectuals further praised the unique superiority of Japanese culture. Cultural anthropologist Nakane Chie in *Vertical Society* (1967) proposed the theory that Japanese society is a "vertical society."

The so-called "vertical society" refers to the fact that Japanese people, especially in interpersonal relationships, place great importance on vertical relationships between superiors and subordinates, forming a vertical collective. Various collectives compete with each other. However, within the collective, people have a sense of belonging and dependence and strive to abandon personal will to pursue overall coordination. She believed that it was precisely this cultural characteristic that enabled Japan to implement the lifelong employment system and made Japan's economic success possible.

By the 1980s, the study of Japanese characteristics and how to evaluate the role of Japanese culture in future civilization had become a focus for many scholars. One scholar even believed that a principle applicable to the whole world would emerge from Japanese traditional cultural spirit.

Looking back at the more than 40 years of post-war Japanese perceptions of tradition, the range of views is vast. However, these perceptions are undoubtedly closely linked to the development of society, especially economic development.

From the perspective of how to deal with tradition in modern construction, Japan's practice has some experiences and lessons worth learning for other developing countries. At the very least, it reminds people: tradition, though not as good as people imagine, is also not as bad as people imagine. Moreover, whether one likes it or not, tradition is ultimately the foundation for a nation's revival.

    浅析战后日本人对传统的认识
    诸葛蔚东
    战后初期，日本人普遍产生一种失落感。随着经济的复苏，学术界又提出民主主义、技术文明与传统文化相结合的思想。
    1949年9月20日，驻日盟军统帅麦克阿瑟在东京对记者说：“由于这场战争，日本已降为四等国。”诚然，战败不仅在国力上给日本造成了巨大损失，也使大多数日本国民产生了一种失落感。在随之涌入的与本国传统迥异的美国文明面前，人们不胜惊恐惶惑。国家在人们心目中的形象一落千丈，民族虚无主义情绪蔓延，就像明治维新时期不少人想把英语作为日本国语，让日本女性与洋人通婚以改变日本人种一样，在战后的废墟面前，西化论再度出现。作家久米正雄当时在《世界春秋》上撰写了《日本美州论》，干脆主张让日本成为美国的一个州……
    战后初期，日本人尤为关注外部世界对自己的看法。美国学者本尼迪克特写的《菊与刀》（1946）在1948年被译成日语文后，遂即成为畅销书。不少人试图赖此以把握自身。在对日本文化和欧美文化加以比较之后，本尼迪克特就日本文化提出了“集团主义”与“耻感文化”这样两个命题。她认为，与欧美普遍存在的个人主义不同，在日本“集团主义”是作为社会组织原理而起作用的。在这个集团内，每个人都非常明白自己在社会中的位置；建立在家族制之上的等级制度规定了人们的思维及行为方式。
  “耻感文化”则诠释了这样一种现象：日本人会因受到公共的嘲笑或摈弃而感到耻辱，因而，每个人都十分注意公众对其行为的态度，并往往以他人的判断为基准确定自己的行动方针。
    本尼迪克特针对日本文化的“类型”所做的分析，对以后人们对日本文化的认识有着决定性的影响。在一些日本人看来，日本文化所具有的这样一些特征成了日本近代化失败的原因。1949年5月，学者川岛武宜在《民族学杂志》上写道：“本书对我们生活的描绘和分析将我们的丑陋面貌赤裸裸地暴露在光天化日之下，迫使我们进行深刻的反思。”
    川岛武宜在战后初期的文化反思风潮中还著有《日本社会中的家族原理》（1948）一书，他认为，日本社会是由家族乃至家族的结合方式构成的。这种家族主义原理与民主主义原理是相对立的，不对此加以否定，日本就不可能实现民主化。
    用大阪大学教授青木保的话来说，当时在日本知识分子中间，川岛武宜的这一主张几乎成了最基本的常识。
    战后初期，加藤周一也和其他学者一样，着手于对传统文化的反思和批判。他首先把矛头对准天皇制，主张大力吸收西方文化。在他看来，日本的传统都是一些封建的东西，而西方的一切都代表了民主与科学。
    朝鲜战争爆发，刺激了日本经济的复苏。50年代中期，日本的经济出现了所谓的“神武景气”，日本人的自信随之逐渐恢复。于是，便有人在1956年的《经济白皮书》上写下了这样一句名言：“如今已不再是战后”。这一年，日本加入了联合国，与苏联恢复了邦交。日本又重新步入了国际社会。 
    传统，虽不像人们想象的那么好，但也决不像人们想象的那么坏。并且，不论情愿与否，传统终归是一个民族复兴的基础。
    与政治、经济形势的渐趋好转相对应，人们开始重新探讨“否定传统”的问题，一些从新的角度对日本传统文化加以评介的观点相继出现。
    1957年10月，加藤周一提出了“日本的近代化只能采取民主主义、技术文明和日本的传统文化相结合的形式”。他认为，战后日本人利用本民族的文化传统与西方的民主和科学相结合的形式，促进了经济发展。
    几乎是在同一时期，日本国立民族学博物馆馆长梅棹忠夫发表了《文明的生态史观》一文，这篇论文在50年代后期的日本颇具影响。论文提出了日本文明与西欧文明呈“平行进化”态势的主张。他认为，日本和西欧分别处于欧亚大陆的两端，二者在生态环境和历史的进化过程中具有惊人的相似性。梅棹忠夫完全拒绝了日本是在追随、模仿欧美的观点，充分表明了他对自身传统文化的自信态度。
    在60年代，一些知识分子则进一步对日本文化的独一无二的优越性大加赞赏。文化人类学者中根千技在《纵式社会的人际关系》（1967）一书中，提出了日本社会是“纵式社会”的学说。
    所谓“纵式社会”，就是日本人在人际关系方面，尤其重视上下级的垂直关系，表现为一种纵式集团。各个集团间相互竞争。但在集团内人们则具有一种归属和依存感，并力求放弃个人意志以追求整体的协调。她认为，正是由于这种文化特征才使得日本能够实行终身雇佣体制，才使日本的经济成功成为可能。
    而到80年代，研究日本人的特征乃至如何估价日本文化在今后的文明史中所能起到的作用问题，已成为相当一部分学者注目的焦点。有一位学者甚至认为，今后，一条适用于全世界的原则将从日本传统的文化精神中产生。
    综观战后40余年日本人对传统的认识，其摆幅是巨大的。但是，这些认识又无疑是和社会的发展，特别是经济的发展密切关联的。
    从在现代化建设中应如何对待传统这一意义上看，日本的实践对其他发展中国家来说，确有一些值得汲取的经验和教训。它起码在这样告诫人们：传统，虽不像人们想象得那么好，但也决不像人们想象得那么坏。并且，不论情愿与否，传统终归是一个民族复兴的基础。
