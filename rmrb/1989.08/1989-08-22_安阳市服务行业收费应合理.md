Recently, we investigated the pricing of 120 units in Wengfeng District and Beiguan District, including hair salons, tailoring, repair services, gaming, beauty, entertainment, and training. We found that 42 units, accounting for 35%, do not follow the pricing standards. Additionally, 78 units, accounting for 65%, do not have clear price listings. For example, men going to a hair salon for a haircut need to pay 3 yuan per person, which is 1.8 yuan more than the standard set by the Price Bureau for a first-class service. For women's shoes, adding two small metal plates costs 2.5 yuan, which is 1.9 yuan more than the standard set by the relevant departments. A woman had a suit made and agreed on a price of 15 yuan, but when picking up the suit, she had to pay 25 yuan. Some neighborhood committees arbitrarily collect sanitation fees and security fees, ranging from 1 to 5 yuan per month, without issuing receipts. Some primary and secondary schools also arbitrarily collect fees. Certain vocational and technical college training classes charge 200 yuan per month, and a kindergarten charges as much as 55 yuan per month, justifying it as "quality service at a higher price."

It is suggested that the relevant departments take measures to promptly address the issue of unreasonable pricing in the service industry.

    安阳市服务行业收费应合理
    最近，我们调查了我市文峰区、北关区120家理发、缝纫、修理、游戏、美容、文娱、培训等等单位的收费情况，发现不执行收费标准的42家，占35％；未明码标价的78家，占65％。如男同志到理发店理发，每人需交费3元，比物价局规定的甲级收费标准高1.8元。女皮鞋钉两个小铁掌，需交费2.5元，比有关部门规定的收费标准多1.9元。一位女同志做一套衣服，讲好工价15元，取衣服时，却要交25元。一些街道居委会随意收取卫生费、治安费，每月1至5元，又不开发票。一些中、小学随意收费，个别大中专院校的培训班月收费200元，某幼儿园月收费竟达55元，美其名曰“优质优价”。
    建议有关部门采取措施，尽快解决服务行业收费不合理的问题。
