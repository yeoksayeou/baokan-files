The city of Hefei, capital of Anhui Province, has undergone 40 years of construction and has now become a city of science shrouded in green.

Before liberation, Hefei had a population of only 500,000 and an area of 5.2 square kilometers. After liberation, especially in the past 10 years of reform and opening up, Hefei has undergone a miraculous transformation. It has gradually developed into a provincial political, economic, and cultural center with a population of 700,000 and an area of 50 square kilometers. More notably, Hefei has emerged as a new scientific city in China. Currently, the city has nearly 30 institutions of higher learning with 23,000 college students enrolled; it has 80 various professional research institutions with over 30,000 technical personnel. A large number of scientific and technological achievements have played a significant role in economic and national defense construction. The ancient city of Luzhou, which had no parks or large green spaces before liberation, was once a monotonous gray and yellow landscape. Now, it has undergone a dramatic change. The beautiful ring park connects all the parks and scenic areas in the city, and the orderly streets and street gardens, along with the lush courtyards, blend harmoniously, creating a city known as the "green city."

    绿荫笼罩的科学城
    安徽省会合肥经过40年的建设，如今已成为一座绿荫笼罩的科学城。
    解放前，合肥仅有人口5万、面积5.2平方公里。解放后特别是改革开放的10年来，合肥发生了奇迹般变化，现已逐步发展成为市区人口70万、面积50平方公里的全省政治、经济和文化中心。更引人瞩目的是，合肥作为我国一个新的科学城的崛起。目前全市拥有高等学校近30所，在校大学生23000人；拥有各类专业科研机构80个，从业科技人员3万多人。一大批科技成果在经济和国防建设中发挥巨大效益。古城庐州解放前没有公园和成片绿地，一片灰黄色格调，如今，旧貌换新颜，漂亮的环城公园把全市公园、风景区连成一体，整齐的街道和点缀闹市的街头游园、参差青翠的庭院珠联璧合，交相辉映，被人们誉为“绿色的城市”。
