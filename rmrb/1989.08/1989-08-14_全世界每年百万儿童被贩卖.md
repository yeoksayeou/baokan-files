According to a report submitted by the Norwegian government to the European Parliament, approximately one million children are trafficked worldwide each year, with the majority coming from impoverished countries. The report states that most of these children are sold for purposes related to pornography, prostitution, or adoption. Others are used for various criminal activities or as domestic servants.

The report identifies four main channels for child trafficking: children from Latin American countries are sold to Europe or the Middle East, children from Southeast Asia are sold to Northern Europe or the Middle East, there are markets in Europe for buying and selling Latin American girls, and girls from West Africa are sold to Arab countries.

Recently, a United Nations agency held a meeting in Geneva to discuss measures to strengthen the fight against child trafficking. The head of the agency, Ed, pointed out that there is currently a global market for children trafficked for pornography, prostitution, and adoption. There are also indications of the emergence of organizations specifically engaged in child trafficking. He believes that this trade should be stopped, and those involved in child trafficking, including brokers and buyers, should be severely punished.

    全世界每年百万儿童被贩卖
    据挪威政府向欧洲议会提出的一项报告，全世界每年约有100万儿童被贩卖，其中大部分儿童来自贫穷国家。报告说，被卖儿童大部分被买主用于色情、卖淫业，或被领养。另外一部分则被用来从事其他犯罪活动或充当佣人。
    报告说，目前儿童交易主要有四个渠道：拉美国家的儿童被卖到欧洲或中东地区，东南亚儿童卖往北欧或中东，欧洲地区设有买卖拉美姑娘的交易市场，西部非洲姑娘被卖到阿拉伯国家。
    联合国有关机构日前在日内瓦举行会议，就加强同贩卖儿童作斗争的措施进行讨论。该机构负责人爱德指出，目前，在世界范围内出现了用于色情、卖淫以及收养为目的的儿童贩卖市场，并有迹象表明出现了专门从事儿童交易的组织。他认为，应该停止这种交易，严惩儿童交易掮客和买主。
