A disturbance and counter-revolutionary riot have been suppressed. Now, the entire nation is reflecting and summarizing, aiming to draw lessons from the experience and turn a bad thing into a good one. Regarding this, I have a point of view: "Revolution requires steadfastness."

A steadfast revolutionary stance comes from a lofty revolutionary ideal and faith. Ideals and faith are like an unquenchable torch, a strong spiritual pillar. Without them, a person is like a kite cut from its string or a ship without a rudder, resulting in either drifting with the current or losing direction. In this disturbance and counter-revolutionary riot, everyone has unavoidably graded themselves. The People's Liberation Army maintained a steadfast stance in this extremely special battle. Many soldiers endured humiliation and sacrificed their lives for the country, passing the test. The vast majority of cadres, workers, peasants, and intellectuals believed in the Party's leadership, opposed the disturbance, and made contributions at their respective posts, also passing the test. However, some people were not like this; in the disturbance and riot, they lost their composure, could not distinguish right from wrong, and could not tell good from bad. They even did some regrettable things that "hurt friends and pleased enemies." Their test papers were failing, and some even scored zero.

In the same examination hall, why is the difference so great? Although many reasons can be found objectively, the fundamental reason must be sought in personal ideals and faith. In the past two years, some people have lost the battle against the onslaught of bourgeois liberalization. They have doubts about the Party's leadership and the socialist system and have not stood firm.

The reason they have such deviations in their understanding is that they do not understand that the establishment of the socialist system is an unprecedented progress in human history. Its dominant side is bright and advanced, with incomparable superiority; but at the same time, socialism also has a process of self-improvement, and in this process, there will be many unsatisfactory aspects. Some comrades have oversimplified this complex process, thinking that once socialism is established, it will be a wide, smooth path paved with rose petals, all bright and smooth sailing. This linear understanding does not match the twists and turns of objective development, leading to vacillation in action. When things are going well, there is still confidence; but once encountering setbacks, especially facing major political storms, confidence is lost, doubting the Party's leadership and the socialist system, thus deviating from the correct path and even going to the opposite side.

Some people say that in this disturbance, they wavered because there were two voices from above, and they were deceived. This is indeed a reason, but external factors are conditions, and internal factors are the basis. There are many lessons to be learned from the subjective aspect. Countless examples from reality and history have proven this. The three sisters of the Song Qingling family, and the three brothers of the cultural giant Lu Xun, originally had similar family environments and objective conditions, but later, the three sisters and three brothers went on completely different paths. I saw a movie some years ago called "The Great Waves Wash Away the Sand." The impression it left on me was profound. The film recounts how, during the Great Revolution, three young people took the revolutionary path together. However, under the test of war, some became stronger, some retreated and fled, and some revealed their ugly faces. Today, in the period of peaceful construction, the opportunity for war tests is less, but the law of the great waves washing away the sand still exists. Isn't it true that many people were washed away and drowned in this disturbance and riot!

"Revolution requires steadfastness, always keep it in mind." Comrade Chen Yi summed up this experience from his decades of revolutionary career and made it his principle for conduct, which is truly valuable. This golden advice should be a mirror for us to examine our personal thoughts and actions. Do you want to avoid being washed away and eliminated in future great waves? Then you must always pay attention to establishing revolutionary ideals and maintaining a steadfast revolutionary stance. No matter what difficulties and setbacks the socialist cause encounters on its path forward, you must remain unyielding and consistent.

    革命重坚定
    丁福村
    一场动乱和反革命暴乱被平息了。如今，全国上下都在思索、总结，以便从中得出教益，把坏事变成好事。对此，我有一点体会，就是“革命重坚定”。
    坚定的革命立场，来自崇高的革命理想与信仰。理想、信仰，是一束不灭的火炬，是坚强的精神支柱。一个人缺了它，就如同断了线的风筝，失了舵的航船，其结果不是随波逐流，便是迷失方向。在这场动乱和反革命暴乱的考验中，每个人都不可回避地给自己打了分。解放军在这一场极为特殊的战斗中，立场坚定。不少战士忍辱负重，以身殉国，经受了考验。广大干部、工人、农民和知识分子，坚信党的领导，反对动乱，在各自岗位上做出了贡献，也经受了考验。可是，有些人不是这样，在动乱和暴乱中乱了方寸，是非不辨，良莠不分，甚至做出了一些“亲痛仇快”的憾事。他们的考卷不及格，有的还打了个零分。
    同处一个考场，差别为何如此之大？尽管可以从客观上找出许多条原因，但不能不从个人理想与信仰上去寻求根本原因。近两年来，有些人在资产阶级自由化思潮的进攻面前打了败仗，他们对党的领导和社会主义制度产生怀疑，没有站稳脚跟。
    他们之所以在认识上出现这样的偏差，是因为不了解社会主义制度的建立，在人类历史上是一个空前的进步。她主导的一面是光明的、先进的，有不可比拟的优越性；但同时，社会主义也有个自我完善的过程，在这个过程中会出现种种不如人意的地方。有些同志把这个复杂的过程看得太简单了，以为社会主义一建立，就是一条铺满玫瑰色地毯的宽敞大道，一片光明，一帆风顺。这种认识上的直线性，和客观事物发展的曲折性不相符合，便带来了行动上的摇摆性。顺利时，尚有信心；一旦遇上挫折，特别是碰到大的政治风雨，便丧失信心，怀疑党的领导和社会主义制度，从而走偏方向，甚至走到反面。
    有人说，在这次动乱中摇摆不定是由于上头有两种声音，自己上当受骗了。这当然是个原因，但外因是条件，内因是根据。从主观方面也是有教训可以吸取的。现实和历史的无数事例，都证明了这一点。宋庆龄一家三姐妹，文化巨人鲁迅一家三兄弟，他们原先所处的家庭环境和客观条件是差不多的，可是后来三姐妹、三兄弟却走了两种完全不同的道路。早些年看过一部电影，叫《大浪淘沙》，观后一直给我留下深刻的印象。影片记述了在大革命时期有三个青年，他们一同走上了革命道路。可是，在烽烟弥漫的战火考验下，有的锻炼得更坚强了，有的退却逃跑了，有的丑恶面目暴露了。今天，处于和平建设时期，战火考验的机会少了，然而大浪淘沙的规律依然存在，不是有不少人在这次动乱和暴乱中被大浪冲倒、淹没了吗！
      “革命重坚定，永做座右铭”。陈毅同志从他几十年革命生涯中，总结了这样一条经验，并当做立身行事的准则，实在可贵。这一金玉良言，应该成为我们对照个人思想行动的一面镜子。你要在今后的大浪中不被冲垮、淘汰吗？那就要时刻注意树立革命的理想，坚定革命立场，不管社会主义事业在前进道路上遇到什么困难和挫折，都要百折不回，始终如一。
