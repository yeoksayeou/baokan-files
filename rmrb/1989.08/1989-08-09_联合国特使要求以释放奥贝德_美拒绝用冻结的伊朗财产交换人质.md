Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 8th.

According to reports from Tel Aviv, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Marrack Goulding today held a one-hour meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, urging Israel to immediately release Lebanese "Hezbollah" leader Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid.

Goulding, at a press conference, stated that Israel's abduction of Obeid does not help in resolving the hostage issue.

Goulding is on a week-long mission to the Middle East as a UN envoy. Israel is the last stop of his tour. Before this, he had visited Syria and Lebanon.

UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar had previously called for Israel to release Obeid; Israel, however, accuses Obeid of masterminding the kidnapping of Western hostages in Lebanon and insists that Obeid will not be released until three Israeli soldiers and Western hostages are freed.

Israel's demand has also been rejected by the pro-Iranian "Hezbollah."

Meanwhile, the Tehran Times reported today that Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said that if the United States agrees to unfreeze Iran's $12 billion in assets in the U.S., Iran would be willing to exert its influence to help Western hostages gain early release.

Goulding will return to the United Nations tomorrow to report on his Middle East trip to the Secretary-General.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 8th, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today said that the United States rejects the idea of unfreezing Iranian assets in exchange for American hostages.

Fitzwater made the remark after President Bush had a brief meeting with Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala. Abu Ghazala had expressed Egypt's willingness to do everything possible to help the United States resolve the hostage issue.

    联合国特使要求以释放奥贝德
    美拒绝用冻结的伊朗财产交换人质
    新华社开罗8月8日电  据来自特拉维夫的消息，联合国副秘书长马拉克·戈尔丁今天和以色列国防部长拉宾举行了一个小时的会晤，呼吁以色列立即释放黎巴嫩“真主党”领导人奥贝德。
    戈尔丁在记者招待会上认为，以色列绑架奥贝德无助于人质问题的解决。
    戈尔丁是以联合国特使身份进行一周的中东之行的。以色列是其此行的最后一站。在此之前，他已访问了叙利亚和黎巴嫩。
    联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔曾呼吁以色列释放奥贝德；而以色列指责奥贝德操纵在黎巴嫩对西方人质的绑架，并表示3名以色列士兵和西方人质获释前，奥贝德不可能获释。
    以色列的这一要求也遭到亲伊朗的“真主党”的拒绝。
    另据《德黑兰时报》今天报道，伊朗总统拉夫桑贾尼表示，只要美国同意解冻伊朗在美国的120亿美元财产，伊朗就愿意施加其影响，帮助西方人质早日获释。
    戈尔丁将于明天返回联合国向秘书长汇报其中东之行。
    据新华社华盛顿8月8日电　白宫发言人菲茨沃特今天说，美国拒绝用解冻伊朗资产来交换美国人质。
    菲茨沃特是在布什总统和埃及国防部长塔列布短暂会面之后作上述评论的。塔列布曾表示，埃及愿意尽一切努力帮助美国解决人质问题。
