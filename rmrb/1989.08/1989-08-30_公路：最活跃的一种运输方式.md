How to Quickly Change the Backward Situation – Discussion on Transportation Issues

Roads: The Most Active Mode of Transportation
Deputy Chief Economist, Planning Department, Ministry of Communications, Yan Qingbin

Adjusting China's transportation structure requires answering a question: can we say that developing railways alone can fundamentally solve China's transportation problems? My conclusion is that it is not possible and cannot be done.

In the world today, there is hardly any country that relies on a single mode of transportation to handle all transportation tasks. It is impossible to attempt to implement a single mode of transportation to cover everything in such a vast country as China. Looking at the history of transportation development in various countries, it is not difficult to see that although different countries have different stages of development for various modes of transportation, by today, most have formed a situation where multiple modes of transportation coexist and develop together. The Soviet Union was once a country that relied heavily on railways, but it is now actively developing roads and other modes of transportation. The United States, with a land area similar to China, has also experienced different stages of transportation development and has now formed a structure with five modes of transportation coexisting. Of course, the changes in the U.S. transportation structure have largely been adjusted through fierce competition. We are a socialist country and should not and cannot rely on such methods to develop. We have the conditions to, based on the country's natural resources, production forces, population distribution characteristics, and the advantages of various modes of transportation, optimize the combination and form a comprehensive transportation system where various modes of transportation are closely linked, complement each other, each playing to their strengths, and developing in coordination.

Road transportation has become an indispensable part of China's social and economic development and is the most active mode of transportation in the comprehensive transportation system. In the past, traditional transportation mainly involved roads handling transportation hubs and short-distance urban transportation. Since the reform and opening up, with the development of socialist commodity economy, cooperation between cities and satellite towns, between urban and rural areas has further strengthened, and the development of export-oriented economies in coastal areas, coupled with the improvement of living standards in urban and rural areas, the demand for medium and short-distance, small-batch, door-to-door cargo transportation has been increasing, and the volume of passenger transportation has been growing rapidly year by year. People have new expectations for convenient, comfortable, and timely travel, and for the timely, fast, safe, and quality transportation of goods, urgently requiring the reduction of transfers and transshipments in passenger and cargo transportation, saving transportation time, accelerating the turnover of materials, reducing cost expenditures, and minimizing the loss of goods during transshipment. This desire and demand have objectively formed a powerful driving force, prompting leaders at all levels of government to recognize the importance of developing road transportation.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out: "I support strengthening basic industries and agriculture. Basic industries refer to raw material industries, transportation, energy, etc. We need to increase investment in these areas and persist for 10 to 20 years. We should even be willing to take on debt to strengthen these areas. This is also part of opening up, and in this regard, we need to be bolder. There will be no major mistakes. We need to build more power, more railways, roads, and shipping, which can accomplish many things." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's views are a summary and distillation of historical experience and provide specific guidance. I hope that relevant departments, especially the decision-makers in these departments, will have sufficient understanding of this and truly pay attention to transportation, especially road construction.

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    公路：最活跃的一种运输方式
    交通部计划司副总经济师　阎庆彬
    调整我国的运输结构，必须回答一个问题，是否能说只要发展铁路就可以从根本上解决中国的交通运输问题呢？！我的结论是不可能的，也是办不到的。
    在当今世界上，几乎没有一个国家是以一种运输方式来承担全部运输任务的，不可能试图在偌大中国的土地上实行一种运输方式，“包打天下”、“独家经营”。纵观一下世界各国的交通运输发展的历史就不难看出，尽管各国在不同历史时期各种运输方式的发展有所变化，但时到今日多已形成各种运输方式综合发展的局面。苏联过去是一个以铁路为主的国家，目前也在积极地发展公路及其他运输方式；国土面积与我国相似的美国，其运输业的发展也经历了不同阶段，目前已形成了五种运输方式并存的格局。当然，美国运输结构的变化在很大程度上是在残酷、激烈的竞争中调整的。我们是社会主义国家，不能也不该靠这种方式来发展，我们有条件，从国家的自然资源、生产力、人口布局特点和各种运输方式的优势出发，通过优化组合，形成各种运输方式紧密衔接、相互配合、各施其长、协调发展的综合运输体系。
    公路运输已成为我国社会经济发展不可缺少的组成部分，是综合运输体系中最为活跃的一种运输方式。在过去的传统运输中，公路大量的是从事运输枢纽和城市短途运输。改革开放以来，随着社会主义商品经济的发展，在城市与卫星城镇，城乡之间的合作进一步加强，以及沿海地带外向型经济的发展，加之城乡人民生活水平的提高，中短途、小批量、门对门的货运需求日趋兴盛，旅客运输量逐年大幅度增长，人们对旅行方便、舒适、及时性，对货物运输的准时、快速、安全、保质有了新的愿望，迫切要求在客货运输中能够尽可能减少换乘、换装、节省运输时间，加速物资周转，减少费用开支，减少货物换装的损耗。这种愿望和要求客观上已形成了一股强大的推动力，促使各级政府领导人认识发展公路运输的重要性。
    小平同志最近指出：“我赞成加强基础工业和农业。基础工业，无非是原材料工业、交通、能源等，要加强这方面的投资，要坚持10到20年，宁肯欠债也要加强。这也是开放，在这方面，胆子要大一些，不会有大的失误。多搞一点电，多搞一点铁路、公路、航运，能办很多事情。”小平同志这些观点是历史经验的概括和提炼，是方向性的具体指导。希望各有关部门，特别是这些部门的决策者对此应有足够的认识，真正对交通运输特别是公路建设重视起来。
