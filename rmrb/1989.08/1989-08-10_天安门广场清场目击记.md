We are eyewitnesses to the clearance of Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4.

At 1:30 AM on June 4, we followed the vanguard of a certain unit of the martial law troops along West Chang'an Avenue and were the first to arrive at the south side of the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen. At that time, the square was broadcasting an emergency announcement from the Beijing Municipal Government and the Martial Law Command. The announcement stated that to change the current situation in Tiananmen Square, the People's Liberation Army martial law troops would clear the square. It was hoped that students and the masses would quickly leave the square, otherwise they would be responsible for the consequences.

We saw that many people and students left the square one after another under the broadcast, but there were still thousands of people gathered around the "Goddess of Democracy" statue and the Monument to the People's Heroes. At the intersection of East Chang'an Avenue and Nanhuizi, some rioters mixed in with the crowd, inciting the uninformed masses, waving fists, and shouting slogans, repeatedly charging towards Tiananmen Square. The martial law troops we followed immediately dispatched soldiers to form several human barricades on the north side of the Chinese History Museum and the south side of the Workers' Cultural Palace along Chang'an Boulevard, blocking the surging crowds. The rest of the troops gathered at the Golden Water Bridge line, awaiting the arrival of the rear units.

Around 2:00 AM, we suddenly noticed a public bus driving east to west along the motor vehicle lane in front of Tiananmen. Upon reaching the east side of the Golden Water Bridge, it quickly turned right and charged towards the officers, soldiers, and armored vehicles gathered to the west. Dozens of officers and soldiers quickly surrounded the bus. The soldiers broke the windows and jumped inside, capturing six rioters. They also found two large barrels of gasoline and more than ten Molotov cocktails on the bus. Among the captured rioters was Guo Haifeng, a standing committee member and secretary-general of the "High-level Autonomous Federation," who had a gold-embossed red student ID card with the number 18824306 and the words "Beijing University Graduate Student ID," as well as a Tiananmen Square unlimited access pass and a command center entry pass.

At this time, we saw that Tiananmen Square was in chaos. Under the spotlight, the approximately 10-meter-tall "Goddess of Democracy" statue stood out prominently. A group of thugs mixed in with the students, shouting, "We will die with the 'Goddess'!" The leader of a certain regiment decided to send the Fifth Company to demolish the "Goddess of Democracy" statue. Company Commander Zhang Dongxu immediately convened a meeting with the company's key personnel to discuss the action plan, setting the signal and the time for support. Deputy Political Commissar Feng Shujing gave a brief and powerful speech. At 3:05 AM, Commander Zhang led Sergeant First Class Xia Weiguo and seven other soldiers to form an assault team, advancing in a single file towards the "Goddess of Democracy" statue. Political Instructor Zhang Jianxin led 20 soldiers to follow behind, providing cover and support.

About 20 meters from the "Goddess of Democracy" statue, the assault team was forced to stop due to the obstruction of a few rioters and some students and civilians. To quickly demolish the "Goddess of Democracy" statue without harming the students and civilians, Commander Zhang shouted to them: Building the "Goddess of Democracy" statue in Tiananmen Square is not in accordance with the national construction law and goes against the wishes of the people of the entire nation. We are here to dismantle it as ordered. Please leave quickly. After the propaganda, most of the students and civilians quickly left, but a few people on the base of the "Goddess" refused to leave and waved their fists, shouting that they would die to protect the "Goddess of Democracy." Seeing this, Commander Zhang ordered the soldiers to advance with their guns. Those people, under the threat of the martial law troops' superior force, revealed their weakness and fled in panic. Then, at 3:26 AM, Commander Zhang led the eight brave soldiers to demolish the "Goddess of Democracy" statue.

Around 2:30 AM, a person dressed in white stood on the central axis of the square with both hands raised. This person was one of the participants in the 48-hour hunger strike farce and was sent by the "High-level Autonomous Federation" to negotiate with the troops. To quickly urge the students to leave the square, the troops immediately dispatched Political Commissar Ji Xingguo of a certain regiment and two soldiers to negotiate. That person said that the students were preparing to retreat, but there were differing opinions, and it would take some time to work it out. The troops agreed. We learned that after that person returned, the students decided whether to leave by voting, with those in favor of leaving shouting "retreat" and those against shouting "persist." The louder voice prevailed. As a result, the call to retreat was louder. Some students, carrying flags, began to withdraw from the southeast side of the square.

At 4:30 AM, the clearance began, with the armed police in the front, infantry in the middle, and armored vehicles in the rear, slowly advancing from north to south. When they reached near the Monument to the People's Heroes, the troops and students were relatively close, but there was no conflict, let alone gunfire. During the clearance, the troops checked every tent on the square, and then the armored vehicles passed through. After most of the students left, several hundred students remained in the southeast corner of the square, unwilling to leave. The troops drove them away. Around 5:30 AM, the clearance ended.

The soldiers immediately began to clean up the square. The tents were dismantled one by one.

The entire process of clearing Tiananmen Square was conducted in an orderly and non-violent manner. At 6:00 AM on June 4, we and a few other comrades intentionally went to the square to inspect the dismantled tents and the area around the Monument to the People's Heroes. We did not find a single dead person or injured person. The use of armored vehicles was mainly to create a deterrent effect, on the one hand, and to prevent rioters from throwing bricks and tiles at the soldiers, and on the other hand, to facilitate the removal of obstacles on the square. The fires in several places on the square were started by the leaders of the "High-level Autonomous Federation" and the "Workers' Autonomous Federation" to destroy evidence, burning files, notes, and various mimeographed leaflets; some students also poured gasoline on discarded bedding and old clothes and set them on fire to obstruct the clearance troops from entering. The lights on the square were turned off before the clearance mainly for two reasons: first, to urge the students to leave quickly as required by the announcement, and second, to issue a preparatory signal for the clearance: as soon as the lights came on, the clearance would begin immediately. There was no shooting at the students during the clearance. Instead, when the troops were clearing near the south end of the Chinese History Museum and the east side of the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, someone on the fourth floor of a building in the southeast corner of the square fired a gun at the troops, injuring the back of the hand of a soldier from the Engineering Corps.

    天安门广场清场目击记
    任宗清　魏厚敏
    我们是6月4日凌晨天安门广场清场的现场目击者。
    6月4日凌晨1时30分，我们随戒严部队某部先头分队，沿西长安街，率先到达天安门前金水桥南侧。这时，广场上正在广播北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部的紧急通告。通告指出，为了改变天安门广场目前状况，人民解放军戒严部队将清理天安门广场，希望广大学生和群众迅速撤离广场，否则后果将由自己负责。
    我们看到，不少群众和学生在广播声中陆续离开广场，但是仍有数千人聚集在“女神像”和人民英雄纪念碑周围。在东长安街路口南池子一带，一些暴徒夹杂在人群中间，煽动不明真相的群众，挥舞拳头狂呼口号，一次次向天安门广场冲击。我们跟随的戒严部队立即派出官兵，在中国历史博物馆北侧和劳动人民文化宫南面的长安大道上，组成数道人墙，挡住了一次次涌来的人群。其余部队在金水桥一线集结，等候后续部队。
    凌晨两点左右，我们突然发现一辆公共汽车沿天安门前的机动车道，由东向西开来，行至东金水桥前，又急速向右转弯，朝聚集在以西的部队干部战士和装甲车猛冲。几十名干部战士迅速包抄过去，将那辆公共汽车围住。官兵们破窗一跃而上，将车上6名暴徒抓获，同时还从车上搜出两大桶汽油和10多个燃烧瓶。战士们在抓获的“高自联”常委、秘书长郭海峰身上，搜到一个烫金红皮学生证，上印“北京大学研究生学生证”，编号18824306，还有天安门广场无限期使用通行证、指挥部人员出入证。
    此时我们看到，天安门广场一片混乱。在灯光照射下，约10米高的“女神像”显得异常刺目。一伙歹徒混在学生中间，叫嚷着“誓与‘女神’共存亡”。某团领导决定派五连前去捣毁“女神像”。连长张东旭当即召集连队骨干研究行动方案，规定信号和接应时间。二营教导员冯书敬进行了简短有力的动员。3时零5分，张连长带领一班长夏卫国等8名战士组成突击队，成一路纵队向“女神像”方位开进。指导员张建新带领20名战士尾随其后，担任掩护接应。
    在距“女神像”20米左右的地方，由于少数暴徒和一些学生、群众的阻拦，突击队被迫停了下来。为尽快捣毁“女神像”，又不误伤学生和群众，张连长大声向他们喊话：在天安门广场建造“女神像”，既不符合国家建筑法，又违背全国人民心愿，我们奉命前来拆除，请大家迅速撤离。经过宣传，大部分学生、群众纷纷撤离，但在“女神”底座上还有少数人不愿撤走，并挥舞拳头，叫喊要誓死保护“女神像”。张连长见此情景，命令战士持枪前进。那些人在戒严部队强大力量的威慑下，暴露了虚弱的本质，一一仓皇逃走。接着，张连长带领8名勇士于3时26分拆除了“女神像”。
    约2时30分，一个身穿白衣服的人，高举双手，站在广场中轴线上。这个人是参与48小时绝食闹剧者之一。他受“高自联”指使前来找部队“谈判”。为尽快督促学生撤离广场，部队立即派某团政委季兴国带两名战士前去交涉。那个人说，学生们准备撤退，但意见不一致，需要一些时间做工作。部队表示同意。我们了解到，那个人回去后，学生们采取表决的办法决定是否撤离，同意撤的喊“撤离”，不同意的喊“坚持”，谁的声音大就按谁的主张办。结果，主张撤离的呼声占了上风。部分学生打着旗帜开始从广场东南方向撤出。
    4时30分，清场开始，按照武警在前，步兵居中，装甲车在后的顺序，由北向南缓缓推进。进至人民英雄纪念碑附近时，部队和学生虽然相距比较近，但没有发生冲突，更没有开枪。部队清场中，对广场上的每个帐篷都做了检查，然后装甲车才通过。大部分学生撤离后，数百名学生仍滞留在广场东南角不愿离去，部队驱赶着他们撤离。约5时半，清场结束。
    接着，指战员们立即打扫广场。一座座帐篷被拆除掉。
    整个天安门广场清场过程，是在有秩序、非暴力的情况下进行的。6月4日早6时，我们同另外几名同志特意到广场上被拆倒的帐篷、人民英雄纪念碑周围察看，没有发现一个死人，没有发现一个伤者。当时使用装甲车，主要是为了造成一种威慑的气势，另一方面是为防止暴徒用砖头、瓦块打砸官兵，再就是便于清除广场上的障碍物。广场几处着火，是“高自联”和“工自联”的头头们为销毁证据，点火燃烧文件、笔记和各种油印传单；也有一些学生把弃之不用的被褥和破旧衣物浇上汽油点燃，想阻止清场部队进入。清场前关闭广场的灯光，主要是出于两种考虑，一是催促学生按通告要求迅速撤离，二是发出清场的预备信号：灯一亮，清场立即开始。清场中决没有向学生开枪。倒是部队清理到中国历史博物馆南端、毛主席纪念堂东侧时，广场东南角一栋4层楼上，有人用火枪向部队射击，将工兵团一名战士手背打伤。
