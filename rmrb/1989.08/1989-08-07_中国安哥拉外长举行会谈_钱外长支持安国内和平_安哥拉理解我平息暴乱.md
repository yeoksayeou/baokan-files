Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro Vandunem on further developing bilateral relations today.

Qian Qichen expressed support for the Angolan government's efforts to achieve domestic peace and hoped that the peace process in Angola would proceed smoothly. He said that as long as all parties involved make joint efforts and strictly adhere to the agreements already reached, achieving peace and stability early is entirely possible, which will create a more favorable environment for the exploitation of economic potential.

Regarding the situation in southern Africa, Vandunem emphasized that Angola would continue to work to promote regional peace and stability. He noted that there have been some noteworthy changes in South Africa recently and hoped that the progressive forces within South Africa would strengthen their unity in the struggle.

Qian Qichen stated that achieving peace and development in southern Africa is not only a strong demand of the people of southern Africa but also a common cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world. China will seriously fulfill its responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, promote the implementation of Security Council Resolution 435, and ensure that Namibia achieves independence on schedule. He reiterated that China firmly supports the South African people's just struggle against the apartheid system and steadfastly supports the reasonable demands and proposals put forward by the frontline states in Africa for seeking regional peace and development.

Both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of relations between China and Angola. Vandunem expressed understanding and support for the Chinese government's decisive measures to quell the counter-revolutionary riots. The two foreign ministers also expressed their desire to continuously consolidate and develop Sino-Angolan friendship and cooperation.

Qian Qichen formally invited Vandunem to visit China at a convenient time, and Vandunem gladly accepted the invitation.

Before the talks, Qian Qichen laid a wreath at the tomb of the late Angolan President Agostinho Neto.
