    The legend tells of a celestial horse that, while galloping through the clouds, accidentally lost its front hoof and fell to the ground. It landed precisely at the foot of the Qilian Mountains. After that, it soared back into the sky, disappearing from sight. However, a large and deep hoofprint was left behind, and thus, the Horse Hoof Temple got its name.

    The Horse Hoof Temple is located in the Ma Ti area of the Yugur Autonomous County in southern Gansu Province, nestled within the Linsong Mountains. Among the towering mountains stands a sheer cliff, a thousand meters high, rising vertically from the ground. The mountain is barren, with smooth walls. Numerous large and small caves are scattered across the mountain. The Horse Hoof Temple is composed of a large group of stone caves. The legendary hoofprint is said to be located in the ninth cave. The Horse Hoof Temple cave group includes South Horse Hoof Temple, North Horse Hoof Temple, Thousand Buddha Cave, Upper, Middle, and Lower Guan Yin Caves, and Jin Ta Temple, totaling seven sites. The distances between these sites vary, with the farthest being five kilometers and the closest being two kilometers. The number of caves at each site varies, with a total of over seventy. According to research, the caves were first carved during the Jin Dynasty, and the existing caves, statues, and murals date back to the Tang Dynasty and later. The scale of the Horse Hoof Temple cave group is second only to Bingling Temple, with North Horse Hoof Temple and Jin Ta Temple being the most well-preserved.

    According to the "Gansu Prefecture Gazetteer," this place was once a large temple, with hundreds of Lamas residing here during the Ming Dynasty. Today, most of the ancient buildings have been destroyed, but the cave art remains intact. As we ascend the steps, sometimes we walk in front of statues with a chasm a thousand meters deep below us, and other times we walk inside caves, where it is pitch black. In the cave known as the "Thirty-Three Heavens," we see nineteen niches arranged in five layers from top to bottom, forming a pagoda shape. It is said that this type of structure is unprecedented in the history of Chinese cave art.

    Jin Ta Temple is divided into two caves, east and west, carved into the red sandstone cliff, about sixty meters above the ground. A set of over two hundred meters of steps leads directly to the cave. The scale of the caves here is even larger than that of North Horse Hoof Temple. The clay statues, though repaired by several generations, still retain the original features. In a larger cave, at the top of a square pillar in the center, there are many flying apsaras painted in vivid colors. Some are perched on the wall, ready to leap, while others are suspended in mid-air, diving downwards.

    马蹄寺
    任真
    天马行空，不慎在云端失了前蹄，坠下地来，不偏不倚落于祁连山下，再腾空而起，不知去向。但一个大而深的马蹄印却永远留了下来，马蹄寺便由此得名。
    马蹄寺位于甘肃南部裕固族自治县马蹄区内的临松山中。群山中猛地突出一座山崖，千丈之高，陡峭之势。垂直立地。山上无草，壁面光滑。大小洞窟密布山上。马蹄寺由一个很大的石窟群组成，传说中的那个马蹄印就在第九窟内。马蹄寺石窟群包括南马蹄寺、北马蹄寺、千佛洞、上中下观音洞和金塔寺七处。相互间的距离，远则五公里，近则二公里。各处的洞窟分布不等，有多有少，共计七十多个。据考证，石窟始凿于晋代，现存的石窟、造像、壁画均为唐代以后遗存。马蹄寺石窟群规模之大，仅次于炳灵寺，其中北马蹄寺、金塔寺保存比较完整。
    根据《甘肃府志》记载，这里原是一座很大的寺院，明代曾有喇嘛五六百人居住。现在古建筑多已毁坏，只有洞窟艺术仍然保存完好。拾级而上，有时从塑像前面走，身下万丈深渊，有时从洞内走，漆黑不见五指。在俗名
  “三十三天”的洞窟内，我们看到十九个窟龛自上而下排列五层，呈宝塔形状。据说这种造型在我国的石窟史上，还未见过。
    其中的金塔寺分东西两窟，开凿在土红色的砂岩崖壁上，距地表面六十多米，有一段二百多米长的台阶直通洞窟。这里的洞窟规模比北马蹄寺还要大，泥塑像虽经几代修饰，仍保持了原塑像的特征。在一个较大的洞窟中央的一个方柱顶端，彩塑着许多飞天，有的着壁，跃跃欲试。有的悬空，向下俯冲。
