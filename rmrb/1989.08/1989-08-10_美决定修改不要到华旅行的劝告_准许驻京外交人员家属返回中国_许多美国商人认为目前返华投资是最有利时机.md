The U.S. State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, announced today that the United States has decided to modify its advice against traveling to China and will allow the families of U.S. diplomatic staff in Beijing to return to China.

Boucher said that the U.S. government made this decision after "careful consideration." She said, "We believe that the security situation in China has improved."

After the Chinese government suppressed the unrest in Beijing in early June, the U.S. State Department issued advice against traveling to China and ordered the withdrawal of 260 family members of U.S. officials working in China.

Boucher said, "Now is the time for these 260 family members to return to China to reunite with their families."

	Our New York correspondent, Liu Kaichen, reports: The August 8 issue of USA Today published a report stating that American and other Western businesspeople plan to return to China to do business as before.

	The report said that more and more American businesspeople are ignoring the limited economic sanctions imposed by the United States on China and are also ignoring the U.S. State Department's advice against traveling to China. They still want to do business in China. They believe that now is the most favorable time to return to China to invest.

	The report said that among the more than 300 American companies doing business in China, most companies believe that it would be too costly to withdraw from the Chinese market easily.
