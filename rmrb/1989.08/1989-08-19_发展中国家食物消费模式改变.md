	The food consumption patterns in developing countries are changing, leading to significant increases in the consumption and import volumes of certain agricultural products.

	Statistics show that from 1980 to 1988, the demand for tea in developing countries increased by an average of 4.6%, sugar by 4%, and wheat used for making bread by 5.4%. In comparison, the average growth rates for these three food items in the 1970s were 3.8%, 2.2%, and 3.2% respectively.

	This trend is primarily due to changes in dietary structures, which have altered consumption patterns. Countries that previously did not have a preference for sweets are now changing their tastes, with increased consumption of candies, soft drinks, and Western-style foods driving this change. As a result, there have been shifts in imports and exports. Countries like Pakistan and India, which are traditional tea exporters, have seen a significant reduction in their exportable quantities due to increased domestic consumption.

	Over the past decade, the coffee consumption rate in developing countries has risen by 0.8%. Countries that previously relied mainly on rice and cassava or other grains have recently shifted to bread as their staple food. In Asia, bread has replaced rice. In Africa, imported wheat has taken over the corn market.

    发展中国家食物消费模式改变
    发展中国家食物消费模式正在改变，并由此导致了一些农副产品消耗量和进口量的大幅度增长。
    统计表明，1980年—1988年，发展中国家对茶叶需求量平均增长4.6％，食糖4％，制作面包用小麦5.4％，而在70年代上述三种食物的平均增长分别为3.8％、2.2％和3.2％。
    这种趋势的出现，主要是由于饮食结构发生变化，引起消费模式的改变。过去不喜吃甜食的国家，正在改变口味，糖果、软饮料和西方口味食品的消费增加，是促成这种变化的主因。因此引起了进出口的变化，巴基斯坦、印度等传统茶出口国家因本国消费增长，使可供出口的数额大幅度减少。
    近10年来，发展中国家咖啡消费率上升0.8％。一些过去以大米和木薯或其它谷物为主的国家，近年都变成以面包为主食。在亚洲，面包代替了大米。在非洲，进口小麦占领了玉米市场。
