A large siliceous dolomite mine, currently the largest in China, has recently been discovered in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province.

	After surveying, it was found that this siliceous dolomite mine has a large distribution area. The average thickness of the ore layer is 15 meters, with the thickest layer reaching 38 meters. The controlled reserves amount to over 1,600 million tons, and the predicted reserves can reach over 5,000 million tons. Most of the ore can be mined by open-pit methods. Preliminary tests show that more than 70% of the ore meets the requirements for first-grade quality. Siliceous dolomite is mainly used as a filler in the production of ceramics, plastics, paper, rubber, paints, and coatings.

    云南发现大型硅灰石矿
    新华社昆明八月十五日电　（通讯员王正端）我国目前最大的硅灰石矿，最近在云南省腾冲县境内被发现。
    经勘查，这个硅灰石矿分布面积大，矿层平均厚十五米，最厚层达三十八米，控制储量达一千六百多万吨，预测远景储量可达五千多万吨，大部分矿石可露天开采。初步测试表明，百分之七十以上的矿石达到一级品要求。硅灰石矿主要用作陶瓷、塑料、纸张、橡胶、油漆涂料等制品的填充剂。
