In the scenic and economically vibrant Pearl River Delta, a new city has risen – Dongguan City in Guangdong Province. Here, the People's Liberation Army is regarded as the "reliance for peaceful construction and the guarantee for prosperity." Protecting the "Great Wall" has become the honorable duty of every citizen. "Even if we become wealthy, we must still do our best to help the soldiers solve their problems and do practical things for them."

Each year, Dongguan City Party Secretary Ouyang De and Mayor Zheng Jintao lead the heads of various bureaus and offices on rounds to the stationed military units several times, discussing and solving some of the military's difficulties on the spot. A certain unit's camp area had a section of yellow mud road that was dusty in dry weather and muddy in rainy weather. Last year, after Ouyang and Zheng visited the unit and learned about this, they immediately decided to allocate 1.5 million yuan from the city government to build a concrete road for the military. The City Transportation Bureau adjusted the local road construction plan accordingly, freed up funds, and prioritized the use of cement here. After several months of hard work by local road construction workers, a 7.6-kilometer, 6-meter-wide concrete road replaced the old muddy path. More than 20 children of military officers stationed in a deep mountain valley faced difficulties in attending school. The military wanted to establish a primary school. The City Education Bureau immediately approved the establishment and selected three teachers with higher teaching levels to teach there. The students' textbooks and teachers' salaries were all paid by the Education Bureau. The City Second Light Industry Bureau learned that the military lacked teaching resources for cultivating dual-use personnel and took the initiative to offer a free industrial accounting training class for the military. After more than a month of instruction, 100 veteran soldiers all graduated qualified.

"For the 'Great Wall,' there should be some special treatment."

In recent years, tens of thousands of technical personnel and workers from various industries across the country have flocked to Dongguan. To control the influx of permanent residents, Dongguan has imposed many restrictions on those who settle in the city. However, the only exception is for demobilized military personnel and family members of stationed military officers who meet the relevant conditions set by the State Council and the Military Commission. In the past three years, more than 780 military officers have been demobilized to Dongguan, and more than 800 family members of active-duty military officers have been transferred in. Dongguan City has prioritized and properly arranged jobs for them.

The Dongguan Education Commission has the following statistics: Over the past 10 years, the admission rate of local students to key junior high schools and high schools has been around 40% each year, while the children of stationed military officers have a 100% admission rate every year. Are the academic achievements of military officers' children all outstanding? It turns out that the local government has given them special treatment.

The per capita income in Dongguan is 1,200 yuan, but Dongguan natives serving as compulsory military personnel can receive an average of 1,500 yuan in subsidies per person per year; over the past decade, the state has allocated 250,000 yuan to Dongguan for the preferential treatment of military veterans and martyrs' families, but Dongguan City alone added 300,000 yuan last year; over the past six years, the city has provided more than 20 million yuan in loans to retired military personnel, including 3.6 million yuan in interest-free loans and 17 million yuan in low-interest loans. "Citizens, we must do everything we can to protect the interests and reputation of the military."

The people of Dongguan believe that the interests of the military represent the interests of the country, and the reputation of the military reflects the reputation of the country. Therefore, they strongly advocate: "As citizens of the state, we must do everything we can to protect the interests and reputation of the military."

A certain artillery brigade used the water source of a reservoir in Huangjiang Town to establish the "Baoshan Wine Factory," which has been quite profitable and has played a good role in the modernization of the military and improving the lives of soldiers and officers. Two years ago, the Huangjiang Town government, unaware of this situation, planned to lease the reservoir to a specialized household for raising ducks and fish to develop the economy. Later, when they learned about the artillery brigade's water usage, they immediately voluntarily abandoned the leasing plan. They said, "Raising fish and ducks in the reservoir would pollute the water source, and the military's wine factory would not be able to operate. To prevent the military's interests from being harmed, it is worth it for us to earn less money."

The military is not perfect. In recent years, there have been a few incidents of soldiers in Dongguan violating public discipline. In response, the local government actively contacted the stationed military and jointly formulated a joint management and education agreement. At the same time, they patiently educated the public, guiding them to see the overall image of the military. Last year during the lychee season, a few soldiers from a certain unit who had enlisted that year picked a few lychees from a tree owned by a local resident and ate them. Someone shouted, "The PLA is stealing lychees." The local government leader immediately intervened, saying, "Individual soldiers violating discipline does not mean the PLA is stealing things. Haven't you seen the PLA soldiers guarding the fruit trees for the public? Even for those few soldiers, look at them, they don't even know how to eat lychees, we should forgive them!" The public forgave the soldiers, and the military strengthened education on public discipline. This year during the lychee season, the local residents specially selected the reddest and largest lychees to send to the unit to comfort the new soldiers training on the training ground.

    爱我“长城”
    ——广东东莞市拥军纪事
    在景色秀丽，经济活跃的珠江三角洲，耸立起一座新型城市——广东省东莞市。在这里，人民解放军被看作是“和平建设的靠山，富裕生活的保证”，维护“长城”成了每个公民的光荣职责。“富了，更要为子弟兵排忧解难办实事”
    东莞市委书记欧阳德、市长郑锦涛每年都要带领各局、办的领导，巡回到驻军部队办公数次，当场商议帮助解决部队一些困难。驻军某部营区内有一段黄泥土路，晴天尘土飞扬，雨天泥泞不堪。去年下半年，欧阳书记和郑市长巡回办公到该部知情后，当即决定由市政府拨出专款150万元，为部队修筑一条水泥路。市交通局对地方修路工程计划作了适当调整，腾出资金，并将紧缺的水泥优先投入这里使用。经过地方筑路工的数月奋战，一条长7.6公里、宽6米的水泥路取代了昔日的黄泥路。驻在深山沟的某部队20多名军队干部子女上学困难，部队想自办一所小学。市教育局马上给予列编，还挑选3名教学水平较高的教师前去任教，学生教材、教师工资全部由教育局支付。市二轻局得知部队培养两用人才缺乏师资力量，就主动免费为部队举办一期工业会计培训班，经过一个多月的授课，百名老战士全部合格结业。
  “对‘长城’就是要有些特殊优待”
    近几年来，全国各地有数十万各行各业的技术人才和工人农民涌入东莞。为了控制常住人口的流入，东莞对落户本市的人员作了许多条文的规定限制。但唯独对分配来的转业军人和要求调入的驻军干部的家属例外，只要符合国务院和军委的有关条件一概接纳。三年来，先后780多名军队干部转业到东莞，800多名现役军人干部的家属调入，东莞市都优先妥善地给他们安排了工作。
    东莞教委有这样一组统计数字：10年来，东莞地方学生每年考入重点初中和高中的升学率为40％左右，而驻军干部子女每年都是100％。部队干部子女的学习成绩个个都拔尖吗，原来是地方政府给予了特殊照顾。
    东莞市的人均收入为1200元，而东莞籍的现役义务兵平均每人每年可拿到1500元的补贴；十多年来，国家下拨给东莞用于军烈属的优待金共计25万元，而东莞市仅去年就追加30万元；6年来，市里先后拿出2000多万元贷款给复退军人，其中无息贷款360余万元，低息贷款1700万元。“公民，要千方百计维护军队的利益和声誉”
    东莞人认为，军队的利益代表着国家的利益，军队的声誉体现着国家的声誉。因此，他们大声呼吁：“是国家公民，就要千方百计维护军队的利益和声誉”。
    某炮旅利用驻地黄江镇一水库的水源办起“宝山酒厂”，收益颇为可观，对部队的现代化建设和改善指战员生活起到很好的作用。前年，不了解这一情况的黄江镇政府为了发展经济，打算将水库承包给养殖专业户放养鸭和鱼。后来，当他们得知炮旅酒厂的用水情况时，立即主动放弃这项承包计划。他们说：“水库养鱼放鸭，弄脏了水源，部队酒厂就办不成了，为了使部队利益不受损失，我们少赚点钱也值得。”
    部队不是十全十美，近些年来，东莞驻军也发生了几起战士违反群众纪律的事情。对此，地方政府一面积极主动和驻军联系，共同制订了共管共教公约。一面耐心细致教育群众，引导群众看军队的整体形象。去年荔枝成熟季节，某部几名当年入伍的北方籍战士，从老百姓树上摘下几颗荔枝就往嘴里塞。有人就嚷嚷解放军偷荔枝。驻地政府领导立即制止说：“个别战士违反纪律，不能就说解放军偷东西，难道你就没有看到解放军战士为群众看管果树吗？就说那几个战士，看他还不懂吃荔枝的样子，我们也该原谅他们呀！”群众原谅了战士，部队则加强了群众纪律教育。今年荔枝成熟季节，驻地群众专门挑选又红又大的荔枝，送到部队慰问正在训练场上训练的新战士。
