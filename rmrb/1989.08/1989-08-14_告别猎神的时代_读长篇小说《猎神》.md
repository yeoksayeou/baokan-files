Title: Farewell to the Era of the Hunter God
Author: Zhang Jiong

Edition: 6

In the vast, profound, and mystical Daba Mountains, there exists a world seemingly isolated from the rest—Sanxing Village. The villagers here mostly make a living by hunting. They are far removed from the commercial society. Not only do they disdain commerce, but they often sell their furs at extremely low prices to outsiders. However, the waves of socialist reform and opening up eventually reached the Daba Mountains. The "Hunter God," Chen Mengyuan, a legendary marksman, surprisingly defied the village's traditions—he abandoned hunting for commerce. He hoped to start with the fur trade and eventually build a hydroelectric power station in Sanxing Village that would bring light to the people. For this enticing ideal, the young man was not understood by the villagers; his father-in-law, who wanted him to inherit and glorify the village's hunting legacy, was disappointed in him; his deeply loving wife, Chunliu, even left him to embrace another hunter, Tie Lida. On the road to realizing his dream, his ambition faced repeated setbacks. Not only was he cheated out of his furs by unscrupulous merchants in Tonglu Town, but in Chengdu, he fell into an even bigger trap of deception and theft, losing almost all the money he had painstakingly saved to build the power station. Fortunately, he encountered the help of good people, which allowed him to rise from deep regret and despair and continue to persistently pursue his goal. This is the basic plot of Huang Fang's novel *The Hunter God* (published by China Youth Press).

The novel weaves together the ancient and pure life of the mountains with the civilization and evil of modern cities, creating a series of mysterious, romantic, worldly, and dangerous images. The author's pen is not only filled with passion and vibrant colors, but also rich in legendary imagination and keen observation of human nature. It has both a dazzling depiction of urban and rural customs and a meticulous portrayal of characters' personalities and psychology. This is a tragicomedy of the Hunter God's fate, and it is also a prelude to the profound changes in the remote mountains of contemporary China. It praises the Hunter God's prowess—a single shot can pierce through a leopard's eyes—and praises the Hunter God's courage and pioneering spirit. It more importantly praises the Hunter God's decisive farewell to the era that has produced Hunter Gods for thousands of years and welcomes the dawn of a new era shining upon the Daba Mountains.

The novel vividly completes the portraits of many characters in its pages. The young Hunter God Chen Mengyuan not only pursues a beautiful life ideal and is loyal to his love but also, due to his initial education and the broader life perspective brought by commerce, has broken free from the villagers' closed and narrow mindset. He understands the value of people more. When he was cheated in Dujiangyan and fell into deep despair, he still bravely jumped into the rapids to save a drowning girl, making his kindness shine brightly. He bids farewell to tradition but retains the villagers' boldness, courage, and simplicity. He welcomes the future, and the modern consciousness permeated with humanistic spirit has slowly grown in his heart, replacing savagery. He is truly worthy of being the Hunter God, but he has resolutely embraced the tide of the times, becoming a reformer in the village and a new entrepreneur!

Other characters in the novel, though described with varying degrees of detail, also leave a deep impression on the readers. Mengyuan's father-in-law, the one-armed old man who wants to eliminate the "Leopard King," has an unyielding will to never coexist with beasts. Tie Lida's rugged and straightforward character, his steadfast love for Chunliu with a touch of wildness, Chunliu's purity, gentleness, and the psychological changes in her love, and Wu Mao's step-by-step degeneration, his mental breakdown after losing money, are all written with such vividness and depth!

In the current literary landscape where new trends are emerging and creative methods are diverse, the author basically follows the path of realism, but it is not without romantic colors. The plot is clear and undulating, and the characters are full of vitality, all of which enhance the artistic charm of this novel. Compared to some avant-garde novels that are confusing and difficult to understand, *The Hunter God* is more straightforward and fluent in its expression, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. It can be said that this is a novel with a new perspective on reform, and it is also a novel that depicts the vast landscape of urban and rural areas in Sichuan. From it, readers can not only obtain aesthetic appreciation and pleasure but also feel the pulse of history and the spirit of the times.

    告别猎神的时代
    ——读长篇小说《猎神》
    张炯
    在那苍茫、深邃而神奇的大巴山中有个似乎遗世而独立的世界——三姓寨。寨中山民大部分以狩猎为生。他们远离商品社会。他们不仅羞于为商，而且常常以低贱的价格把毛皮卖给外来的商人。然而，社会主义改革、开放的浪潮终于也冲击到了大巴山。山民中的“猎神”，百发百中的神枪猎手陈梦猿，居然起来悖逆山寨的传统——弃猎从商。他希望从经营毛皮贩运开始，日后在三姓寨建设一座给人们带来光明的水电站。为了这个诱人的理想，年轻人不被寨里人所理解，渴望由他继承和光大山寨狩猎神威的岳父对他表示失望；深深爱他的妻子春柳竟至舍他而去，投入另一猎手铁力大的怀抱。在实现理想的道路上，他的雄心屡受挫折，不仅在铜绿镇被不法商贩用假票骗走了毛皮，去到成都还落入更大的坑蒙拐骗的圈套，被人连诓带偷，几乎将好不易积聚起来建水电站的几万元丢得精光。万幸的是他遇到了好人的帮助，这才从万分懊恼和沮丧中重新挺起腰杆，继续坚韧地坚持自己的目标。这是黄放的长篇小说《猎神》（中国青年出版社出版）所描述的基本故事情节。
    小说把山野古老而纯朴的生活跟现代都市的文明与罪恶交织起来，编排出一幅幅又神秘、又浪漫、又世俗、又险恶的五光十色的图画。作者的笔墨不仅激情洋溢，闪耀鲜明色彩，而且富于传奇的想象，精于世道人心的审察，既有对城乡风情的斑斓缤纷的描绘，又有对人物性格心理的雕镂入微的刻画。这是部猎神命运的悲喜剧，也是一部当代中国山野僻壤深刻变革的前奏曲。它歌颂猎神的神威——一枪能穿过山豹的双眼，歌颂猎神的勇敢品质与进取精神，它更歌颂猎神坚决地告别那数千年来产生猎神的时代，迎接一个崭新时代的曙光照临大巴山区。
    小说生动地完成自己笔下众多人物的塑像。年轻的猎神陈梦猿不仅追求美好的生活理想，忠于自己的爱情，而且由于他已有初步的文化和经商带来的更广阔的生活视野，他已从山民封闭狭窄的心理定势中突破出来，更为懂得人的价值。他在都江堰被骗，陷入极度沮丧之中，却能见义勇为，跳到激流中去救出落水的少女，更使他的善良闪射耀目的光彩。他告别传统又具有山民传统的慓悍、勇敢、淳朴，他迎接未来，渗透人道精神的现代意识已代替野蛮在他内心慢慢生长。他不愧为猎神，但他已毅然决然地拥抱时代的大潮，成为山村的改革派、成为新起的企业家！小说中的其他人物虽然着墨浓淡有异，也都给读者留下深刻的印象。梦猿的岳父、想消灭“豹王”的独臂老人那种铁板订钉般的人兽誓不两立的意志，铁力大的粗犷坦荡、一诺重千金的性格与对春柳的执著的带着野性的爱情，春柳的纯真、温柔及其爱情转移的心理演变、五毛步步堕落的心理历程和盗款、失款后的精神失常，写来都真切感人！
    在当前小说新潮迭起，创作方法多元的文坛格局中，作者基本上走着现实主义的创作道路，但又不乏浪漫主义的色彩。故事情节又脉络清楚、波澜起伏，人物形象又个个透出力度，都增强了这部小说的艺术魅力。比之某些新潮小说的扑朔迷离、诘屈聱牙，《猎神》又以其表述的晓达流畅，使广大读者不存阅读障碍。可以说，这是一部描写改革的颇有新意的小说，也是描写川中城乡广阔图画的小说，从中，读者不仅可以得到美的熏陶与愉悦，更能感受到历史脉搏的跳动与时代精神的昂扬。
