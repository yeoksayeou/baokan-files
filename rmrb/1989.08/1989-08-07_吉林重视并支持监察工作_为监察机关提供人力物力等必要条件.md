Jilin Provincial Committee and Provincial Government attach great importance to administrative supervision work, providing necessary working conditions for supervision agencies at all levels in the province in terms of personnel and material resources.

In February this year, the Provincial Committee and Provincial Government convened a meeting attended by mayors, prefectural heads, and commissioners, as well as the directors of the supervision bureaus from eight regions. The meeting discussed and resolved issues related to the working conditions of supervision agencies. Based on the opinions and demands of the attendees, the Provincial Government decided that the vehicles and funds for case handling by supervision agencies at various levels should be provided by the respective cities, regions, prefectures, and counties. The welfare benefits for supervision personnel can be appropriately supplemented in reference to the methods used by the auditing, industrial and commercial administration, and taxation departments. The personnel quota issue can be resolved through various channels as much as possible.

So far, the working conditions for supervision agencies at all levels in the province have been basically met. The issue of case handling subsidies for supervision personnel in various cities, regions, prefectures, and counties (cities and districts) has been universally resolved. The dual-track system for official positions has been implemented in supervision agencies at the county level and above. The case handling funds for supervision agencies at various levels have been well secured, ensuring the normal needs of case handling. To strengthen the supervision agencies, with the approval of the Provincial Government, 430 additional supervision personnel have been added across the province.

    吉林重视并支持监察工作
    为监察机关提供人力物力等必要条件
    本报讯　吉林省委、省政府十分重视行政监察工作，从人力、物力等方面为全省各级监察机关提供必要的工作条件。
    今年2月，省委、省政府召开了市长、州长、专员和8个地区监察局长等参加的座谈会，研究解决监察机关的工作条件问题。根据到会者的意见和要求，省政府决定，各级监察机关的办案用车、经费由各市、地、州、县解决。监察干部福利待遇，可参照审计、工商、税务部门的办法给予适当补贴。编制问题可以通过多种渠道尽量解决。
    到目前为止，全省各级监察机关的工作条件已基本具备。各市、地、州、县（市、区）监察干部办案补贴问题已经普遍解决。县以上各级监察机关普遍实行了干部职务双轨制。各级监察机关的办案经费也得到了较好的落实，保证了办案的正常需要。为了加强监察机关的力量，经省政府批准，全省监察干部增编430人。　（简轩）
