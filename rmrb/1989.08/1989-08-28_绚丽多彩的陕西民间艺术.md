Shaanxi has over 39,000 pieces of folk art collected in provincial and regional folk art museums. Among them, the Weibei horse-tethering posts and Suide stone lions have garnered significant attention, often referred to as the "terracotta warriors on the ground." Shaanxi's folk paintings, paper cuttings, embroidery, sculptures, ceramics, weaving, tie-dyeing, puppets, shadow plays, opera masks, and ceremonial face paintings are all unique in style and vibrant in color. Luochuan shadow puppets, Ansai and Fengxiang paper cuttings are particularly favored by domestic and international audiences. In recent years, these art products have been sold in over 30 countries, including Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe and America, promoting cultural exchange and achieving good economic returns. The Shaanxi Folk Art Museum has earned 1.11 million yuan in foreign exchange over three years.

Currently, Shaanxi's folk artists are integrating traditional artistic features with modern aesthetic consciousness, developing new products such as wool and hemp embroidery, silk embroidery, paper-cut stickers, fabric collage paintings, wooden horse spoon masks, and wall hangings. Shaanxi folk art has entered a phase of blending tradition and innovation, fostering continuous development.

    现在，陕西的民间艺人开始把艺术品的传统特色与现代审美意识相结合，研究出毛麻绣、穿罗绣、剪纸贴画、布堆花画、木马勺脸谱、壁挂等新产品。陕西民间艺术已步入今古融合、创新发展的领域。
