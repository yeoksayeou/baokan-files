According to information provided by the Qingdao Municipal Government Office, by 6 PM today, the surface fires at the Huangdao oil depot have been extinguished. However, there are still some residual fires in several underground culverts and pipelines. The fire command center is organizing firefighters to carefully inspect each oil tank and pipeline to eliminate hazards and completely extinguish the fire.

Today, Huangdao District continued to organize cadres and the masses to clean up roads and remove residual oil using a division of labor approach. Cleanup work on the sea surface has also begun. This has created conditions for the oil port to resume production as soon as possible.

Currently, the Huangdao oil depot has partially resumed production, and the ferry from Qingdao to Huangdao will resume vehicle transport tomorrow morning.

It has been confirmed that 19 people have died in the firefighting and rescue efforts. A total of 74 injured people have been treated, of whom 49 are still undergoing treatment.

Firefighters are closely monitoring potential situations to prevent the fire from reigniting.
