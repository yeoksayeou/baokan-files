Forests grow in the open air, exposed to the elements in an open environment, often subjected to various disasters and desecrated by ignorance and greed. Fires, storms, droughts, pest infestations, diseases, and human-induced logging can all destroy forests. A decade of growth can be ruined in an instant!

The earth needs the protection of forests, and forests need people to protect them. Below, we introduce a few ordinary forest rangers who live in the forests year-round, working silently and tirelessly, using their sweat, blood, and even their lives to safeguard the country's limited forest resources.

Registering Trees

Cái Wànxùn graduated from the Taishan Agricultural College in December 1979 and was assigned to the Pengji Forestry Station. Perhaps due to his proximity to Confucius' hometown, the phrase "克己复礼" (self-discipline and adherence to rituals) was well-known. The young Cái Wànxùn ingeniously borrowed this phrase for his forest protection work, changing it to "克己护绿" (self-discipline to protect greenery), vowing to dedicate his life to being a guardian of green civilization.

In the spring of 1981, at the age of 22, Cái Wànxùn was promoted to deputy station director and took charge of the work. His first move was to adjust the station's operational mechanism, transform its functions, and strengthen management. The station had a bit of money, which was immediately invested in forest protection, improving transportation, communication, and management tools.

The vast Pengji Town had only a dozen forest rangers, which was far from enough! He organized more people to protect the greenery. Thus, a joint defense forest protection team was formed, with 4 people from each of the 53 natural villages. The forest protection team members earned a monthly salary of 60 yuan, with a fine of 5 jiao for each missing small tree and a fine equal to twice the value of the tree for each missing large tree.

Cái Wànxùn should have felt relieved, but he still felt something was missing. He wanted to register each tree, assign it a number, and record it in the archives. When people drove by on the road, they could see the trees on both sides with large trees marked for imminent logging and small trees marked as replacement trees. Each tree was numbered and accounted for; who planted it and who managed it was clear. If a tree was missing, the responsible person could be found immediately, and the fine could be collected, with a replacement planting deadline set.

Those vast forests of large and small trees, with numbers painted in red on their trunks, looked like ginseng roots tied with red strings; they all had mothers to care for them. The loving mother was Cái Wànxùn, who cherished the trees like his own children.

Strictly Guarding the Gate

Xiāo Jìliáng, the director of the Chupuzi Timber Inspection Station in Hubei Province, is known as the "Green Judge Bao." He strictly guards the gate to protect forest resources, unaffected by personal favors, unyielding to lawbreakers, and unshaken by punches and kicks. One day in June last year, the station duty officer told Xiāo Jìliáng that his brother had brought a carload of chairs through the checkpoint early in the morning. Old Xiāo was furious and stopped a passing car to give chase. Eight kilometers away at the Tingxi Bridge, he caught up with his brother, who shouted, "What are you doing here? In 1984, you harmed me once at the Zhao Liqiao checkpoint. Are you here to harm me again?" Old Xiāo retorted, "You are harming yourself. Think about it, if I let you go, how can I manage others?" In the end, the chairs were brought back to the station and confiscated.

Currently, the practice of seeking favors and writing notes is prevalent, but Old Xiāo does not fall for it. Last January, a relative of a city leader used coal to disguise and smuggle timber out of the country, which was discovered and stopped by Old Xiāo. The supervising department called and sent notes multiple times requesting release, but Old Xiāo refused. "If the common people are not allowed to light lamps, can the officials start fires?" This has become Old Xiāo's catchphrase. No wonder people often say that the red poles at the Chupuzi Timber Inspection Station are like nails, never yielding to anyone.

Old Xiāo often says, "The value of life lies in dedication. As long as one's efforts are devoted to the cause of protecting forest resources, bringing green mountains and rivers, all pain will fade in happiness." At the end of last year, the Chupuzi Native Products Procurement Station illegally purchased 16,000 handles without a license. Old Xiāo learned about it and went to persuade them in person. However, they not only did not listen but also beat Old Xiāo, causing serious injuries and requiring hospitalization. He only stayed in the hospital for a week before returning to his post.

Walking the Entire Hualan Mountain on Foot

Since the founding of the nation, the government has taken measures to protect the forest resources of the Hualan Mountain, assigning a group of full-time forest rangers. Zhōu Zhànchéng is one of them. Since taking on this job, he has rooted himself in the Hualan Mountain, dedicating his body to the party's arrangements. From south to north, covering over 100 kilometers of mountain roads, without roads or transportation, he has walked the entire Hualan Mountain range on foot. Whether in the vast coniferous forest area or the dense broad-leaved forest, his sweat has been shed, and his footprints have been left.

Patrolling is a laborious task for forest rangers. For someone over 50, it is even more strenuous. Every step up the slope and every mountain he climbs, Old Zhou is drenched in sweat, with aching waist and legs, and does not want to get up once he sits down. No, he must complete the inspection of this forest and then return to eat and rest. Perhaps someone might say, "If you can't return, just don't return." But what to eat? Where to stay? In the mountains, freezing to death is common. Old Zhou insists on patrolling the mountains multiple times each month. During holidays, while others rest at home, he is on duty in the mountains, also worrying about tourists playing with fire and breaking branches. In his jurisdiction, there have never been any fires or illegal logging incidents.

This August, many people are picking mushrooms, some of whom do not even know basic mountain knowledge and use fire indiscriminately, posing a fire hazard at any moment. He took corresponding measures, carrying dry rations, going wherever there are people. During rainy and snowy days, enduring cold, hunger, and rain is a common occurrence. It is in such harsh conditions that he has spent over 30 years.

    保护绿色的功臣
    ——记三位全国模范护林员
    林萱
    森林生长在露天，在开放性的大环境中常遭七灾八难之摧残，备受愚昧与贪欲之亵渎。火灾、风灾、旱灾、虫灾、病害和人为的乱砍滥伐，都能致森林于死地。十年树木，可能毁于一旦！
    大地需要森林护盖，森林需要人们保护。下面我们介绍的是几个普普通通的护林员，他们常年生活在森林之中，默默无闻，任劳任怨，用他们的汗水、鲜血，甚至生命保卫着祖国有限的森林资源。
    给树木上户口
    柴万训是1979年12月由泰安农校毕业，来到彭集林业站的。也许是距孔老夫子的家乡太近，“克己复礼”这个词家喻户晓。年轻的柴万训竟然独出心裁，把“克己复礼”一词借用到护林工作中，改为“克己护绿”，决心一辈子当绿色文明的拱卫者。
    1981年春，年仅22岁的柴万训被提为副站长，主持工作。他出手第一拳就是调整林业站的运行机制，转变职能，强化管理。林业站有了一点钱，就毫不犹豫地投到森林保护上来，添了交通通讯和管护手段。
    若大的彭集镇，只有十几个护林员，当然远远不够！他组织更多的人来护绿。于是，由53个自然村每村4人组织起来的联防护林队诞生了。护林队员月工资60元，少一棵小树罚5角，少一棵大树罚树木价值的一倍。
    柴万训该放心了吧，不，柴万训还觉得美中不足。他要给树木上户口，编号码，记入档案。当人们坐车从公路上驶过，见到两边行道树，有大树标明即将采伐，有些小树标明是接班树。棵棵编了号，上了帐；谁栽、谁管一清二楚。少一株马上就能找到责任者，马上就能兑现罚款，订出补植期限。
    那一望无边的大树、小树，腰间涂着用红油漆编写的号码，一个个就像用红毛绳扎头的人参，都成了有娘的孩儿；有人看，有人护。它们的慈母，就是这个爱树如子的柴万训。
          严格把关守口
    湖北省蒲圻市官塘驿木材检查站站长肖继良，人称“林包公”。他为保护森林资源严格把关守口，人情风吹不动，不法分子闯不过，拳打脚踢摧不垮。去年6月的一天，站值班员告诉肖继良，他的哥哥一大早带着一车椅子闯过关口。老肖一听火冒三丈，拦住一辆过路车就追。在八公里以外的汀泗桥，追到了哥哥，哥哥一见就吼了起来：“你来干什么？1984年，你在赵李桥检查站害了我一次，这次是不是又来害我？”老肖毫不客气：“你是自己害自己，你想一想，放了你，我如何去管别人。”最后，椅子被拉回站里作价没收。
    时下说情风、批条风盛行，老肖就是不吃这一套。去年1月，市里一位领导人的亲戚用煤伪装带树出境，被老肖检查发现卡了下来，主管部门三番五次打电话、来条子要求放行，可老肖就是不放。“不许百姓点灯，难道州官就能放火吗？”这已成为老肖的口头语。难怪人们常说，官塘驿木材检查站那红杆子就像钉子钉的一样，是从来不认人的。
    老肖经常说：“人生的价值就在于奉献，只要自己的心血能融汇在保护森林资源事业中，换来山河翠绿，一切痛苦都会在幸福中淡化。”去年底，官塘驿土产收购站，无证收购柄把1.6万根，老肖知道后，亲自上门劝阻。可是，他们不但不听，反而对老肖拳打脚踢，打成重伤，住院治疗。他只在医院住了一个星期，便又走上了岗位。
    双腿走遍贺兰山
    建国以来，政府对贺兰山的森林资源采取了保护措施，配备了一批专职护林员。周占成便是其中的一名。自担任此工作以来，他把根牢牢地扎在了贺兰山上，把身交给党安排。从南到北长达100多公里山路，在无公路又无交通工具的条件下，他硬是凭两条腿走遍了贺兰山脉。不论是浩瀚的针叶林区，还是成荫的阔叶林内，都洒下了他的汗水，留下了他的足迹。
    进行巡查是护林人员的一项辛苦的工作。对50多岁的人来讲，那就更吃力，每往高坡上迈进一步，每跋一座山坡，老周就大汗淋漓，腰酸腿痛，坐下就不想起来了。不行，必须查完这片林，还得回去吃饭和休息。也许有人说，回不去就不回去了。不回吃啥？往哪住？在山里，冻死人是常有的事。老周每月都坚持巡山多次。每逢节假日，别人在家休息，他在山里值班，并且还要操心游人玩火、折树枝等。在他的管辖区内，从没有发生火情、火灾，也没有乱砍滥伐的事件发生。
    今年8月，捡蘑菇的人很多，有的甚至连山林的一般常识都不懂，随便用火，每时每刻都有发生火灾的可能。他采取相应的措施，背上干粮，哪里有人哪里就有他。赶上雨雪天，挨冻挨饿受雨淋是家常便饭。就是在这样艰苦的环境中，他度过了30多年。
