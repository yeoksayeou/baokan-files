On the map of our motherland, Heilongjiang Province is like a swan spreading its wings, ready to take flight, displaying its enchanting and beautiful posture. I am deeply moved as I think about Heilongjiang's past, present, and future, and my heart cannot calm down.

Heilongjiang, this rich and beautiful place, has had the ancestors of ethnic minorities living, working, and reproducing here since ancient times. Due to its late development, it has only a history of nearly a hundred years. In the late 19th century, the Czarist Russian government and the Qing government signed the "Sino-Russian Secret Treaty," making the Heilongjiang River basin a colony of imperialist plunder. After the "September 18 Incident," Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China. The dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, along with the brutal colonial rule, plunged the people of Heilongjiang into a sea of suffering. Many of the older generation who were once "laborers" still remember the "mass graves" filled with bones in the coal mines of Jixi and Hegang. Even more people will not forget the sad and mournful melody of "My Home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China." The bloody and tearful modern history made the people of Heilongjiang realize that capitalism could not save China; class hatred and national resentment made the people of Heilongjiang firmly follow the Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, after arduous struggles, Heilongjiang finally became one of the earliest provinces to be liberated in the country.

Not long after the founding of New China, Heilongjiang was listed as a key construction province. During the "First Five-Year Plan," industrial construction investment accounted for 10.3% of the national total, and out of the 156 key construction projects nationwide, 22 were built in Heilongjiang, laying the initial foundation for the development of Heilongjiang's industry. The people of Heilongjiang will never forget that in March 1958, following the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Wang Zhen led 100,000 demobilized soldiers to the "Northern Wilderness," clearing the way, enduring hardships, and opening up vast fields in the wilderness that had slept for thousands of years. In the early 1960s, under the direct care of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, Comrades Yu Qiuyi and Kang Shien led the world-renowned Songnen Plain Oil Battle. The battle army persisted with the "Two Theories," endured the scorching heat and severe cold, and with the strong support from all sides, quickly and efficiently developed the Daqing Oil Field, thus ending China's history of using "foreign oil." In early 1964, the Central Government decided to develop and build the Daxinganling Forest Area. Comrades Luo Yuchuan and Guo Weicheng led the railway engineering troops, technical personnel, and forestry workers into this ancient primitive forest, not only standing firm in this "high-cold restricted area," but also building a mechanized forestry production base. Over the past forty years, tens of thousands of intellectuals and tens of thousands of educated youth have responded to the Party's call, coming from all over the country to Heilongjiang, dedicating their youth and wisdom to this vast land, creating heroic deeds that are worth singing and telling. The forty-year history of Heilongjiang's development is a history of arduous struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, following the socialist path. It vividly reflects the superiority and strong cohesion of the socialist system, and also convincingly proves that the Communist Party of China not only has the ability to lead the people to overthrow the old system but also has the ability to lead the people to build a new China. It is the irreplaceable leading core of the cause of socialist modernization.

In the forty-year development process of Heilongjiang, there have also been detours. Especially during the "Cultural Revolution" decade, the "leftist" line of "class struggle as the key link" caused economic construction to be repeatedly impacted by political movements, and social productive forces were seriously damaged. However, it was our Party itself that, through reflection on historical experience, established the basic line of focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. This finally broke the long-term closed and stagnant situation, opening a new stage in China's socialist modernization construction. The ten years of reform and opening up have been the period when Heilongjiang's economic strength has grown the fastest and the people have benefited the most, and it is also one of the best periods since the founding of the country. After ten years of reform and opening up, we have achieved unprecedented glorious achievements, but we have also encountered unprecedented new problems. Compared with the southeastern coastal region, Heilongjiang Province has the advantage of raw materials; compared with the western region, it has the advantage of a strong industrial foundation and technological strength; compared with some inland provinces, it has the advantage of being a frontier area for opening up to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. As long as we seize the opportunity, remain steadfast, and consistently adhere to the basic line of "one center and two basic points," starting from the reality of Heilongjiang, relying on technological progress, deeply developing resources, adjusting the industrial structure, enhancing development momentum, adhering to the southward connection and northward opening, implementing multi-lateral opening, improving economic benefits, and coordinating stable development, the future of Heilongjiang will definitely be brilliant.

Every time we stand in front of the map of our motherland, gazing at the "swan" that seems ready to take flight, we seem to see the vast forest sea, the surging rivers, the fertile black soil, the towering drilling towers, and the hardworking parents and fellow villagers. We feel that the task is heavy and the road is long. I firmly believe that the "swan" entering its "forty years" will definitely spread its wings and take flight in the next forty years.

    天鹅展翅欲腾飞
    ●中共黑龙江省委书记  孙维本
    在祖国的地图上，黑龙江如同一只展翅欲飞的天鹅，展现着她那妖娆美丽的风姿。我深情地想到黑龙江的昨天、今天和明天，心情久久不能平静。
    黑龙江这个富饶美丽的地方，远古时代就有少数民族的祖先在这里劳动、繁衍、生息。由于开发较晚，它至今不过近百年的历史。十九世纪末，沙皇俄国与清政府签订《中俄密约》，黑龙江流域成了帝国主义列强瓜分掠夺的殖民地。“九·一八”事变后，日本帝国主义侵占东北，帝国主义和封建势力的双重压迫和残暴的殖民统治，使黑龙江人民处于水深火热之中。许多当过“劳工”的老一辈人都还记得鸡西、鹤岗煤矿那白骨累累的“万人坑”，更多的人不会忘记“我的家在东北松花江上”那悲凉凄婉的旋律。血与泪的近代史，使黑龙江人民悟透了资本主义救不了中国的道理；阶级仇、民族恨，使黑龙江人民坚定跟共产党走。在共产党领导下，经过艰苦斗争，黑龙江终于成为全国解放最早的省份。
    新中国成立后不久，黑龙江即被列为国家重点建设省份。“一五”时期，工业基本建设投资占全国的10.3％，全国156项重点建设项目有22项在黑龙江兴建，初步奠定了黑龙江工业发展的基础。黑龙江人民永远不会忘记，1958年3月，根据毛泽东主席的指示，王震同志率领十万转业官兵挥师“北大荒”，披荆斩棘，风餐露宿，在沉睡千年的荒野上开垦出大片良田。六十年代初期，在周恩来总理、邓小平副总理的直接关怀下，余秋里、康世恩等同志领导了举世瞩目的松嫩盆地石油大会战。会战大军坚持“两论”起家，顶酷暑，战严寒，在四面八方的大力支援下，高速度、高水平地拿下了大庆油田，从而结束了我国使用“洋油”的历史。1964年初，中央又决定开发建设大兴安岭林区。罗玉川、郭维城等同志率领铁道兵、工程技术人员和林业工人，开进这古老的原始森林，不仅在这“高寒禁区”站住了脚，而且建成了机械化林业生产基地。四十年来，还有几十万知识分子和几十万知识青年响应党的号召，从全国各地奔赴黑龙江，把青春和智慧无私地奉献给这片广袤的土地，创造了可歌可泣的英雄业绩。黑龙江四十年的开发建设史，是一部在共产党领导下、沿着社会主义道路艰苦创业的历史。它生动地体现了社会主义制度的优越性和强大凝聚力，也雄辩地证明，中国共产党不仅有能力领导人民摧毁旧制度，也完全有能力领导人民创建新中国。她是社会主义现代化事业不可替代的领导核心。
    黑龙江四十年的发展历程中，也曾走过弯路。特别是“文革”十年，“以阶级斗争为纲”的极“左”路线，使经济建设屡受政治运动的冲击，社会生产力遭到严重破坏。但是，正是我们党自己，经过对历史经验的反思，在十一届三中全会以后，逐步确立了以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的基本路线，终于打破了长期以来封闭和停滞的局面，开辟了我国社会主义现代化建设的新阶段。改革开放这十年，是黑龙江经济实力增长最快、人民得实惠最多的时期，也是建国以来形势最好的时期之一。经过十年的改革开放，我们既取得了过去不曾有过的辉煌成就，也遇到了过去不曾有过的新问题。与东南沿海比，黑龙江省有原材料的优势；与西部地区比，有工业基础和科技力量雄厚的优势；与内地一些省份比，有向苏联、东欧开放的前沿地带的优势。只要我们审时度势，坚定不移，一以贯之地坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，从黑龙江实际出发，依靠科技进步，深度开发资源，调整产业结构，增强发展后劲，坚持南联北开，实行多边开放，提高经济效益，协调稳定发展，黑龙江的明天必定是光辉灿烂的。
    每当我们站在祖国的地图前，凝视着那只呼之欲出的“天鹅”，就仿佛看到浩瀚的林海、奔涌的江河、肥沃的黑土、高耸的钻塔和辛勤劳作着的父老乡亲。我们感到任重而道远。我深信，进入“不惑之年”的“天鹅”，在下个四十年里一定会展翅腾飞。
