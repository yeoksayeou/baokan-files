    At the beginning of this year, Dandong City in Liaoning Province uncovered over a thousand "four fake" enterprises. These enterprises, which were not actually collective, new, school-run, or welfare enterprises, used various means to hang fake signs and enjoy tax exemptions and reductions. Some even changed their licenses and signs once the exemption period ended, becoming "new" enterprises again to "enjoy" tax exemptions and reductions, effectively evading taxes. After relevant departments in Dandong City conducted a cleanup, they recovered a total of 12.13 million yuan in unpaid taxes.

    This is one example. Another is Jiangsu Province's special inspection of individual industrial and commercial taxes, which recovered 51.7 million yuan in unpaid taxes in just two months. Among them, an individual business in Wujin County paid back 3.8 million yuan in taxes.

    The above two examples show that the current financial and tax system has significant issues of "leakage" (diao, mao, di, lou), which are widespread and involve large amounts of money. These issues not only affect the stable growth of fiscal revenue but also disrupt the normal economic order, causing unfair social distribution, corrupting social ethics, and impacting overall stability.

    In recent years, while the state's fiscal difficulties have been evident, a significant amount of revenue that should have been collected has been lost. Some units either delay or withhold tax payments, or use fraudulent means to obtain tax exemptions and reductions. Many individual industrial and commercial households have become wealthy through illegal operations and tax evasion, seriously harming national interests.

    The emergence of these problems exposes loopholes in the work of relevant departments, such as lax management and ineffective supervision. Changing this situation, plugging the loopholes, and increasing state fiscal revenue have great potential. Relevant departments should pay high attention to this. They should strictly follow policies, not arbitrarily grant tax exemptions and reductions, fairly collect taxes, and not show favoritism. Effective measures should be taken to collect all the taxes that the state should collect. It is hoped that all localities will, like Jiangsu Province and Dandong City, make serious efforts to clean up and collect all the taxes that should have been collected but were not. I believe that if all localities do this, they will definitely see results.

    把该收的都收上来
    钊拓
    今年初，辽宁省丹东市清理出一千多户“四假”企业。这些企业明明不是集体企业、新办企业、校办企业或民政企业，却不择手段，挂上假招牌，享受了减免税优惠。更有甚者，有的减免期一到，执照一换，牌子一翻，又成“新办”企业，重新“享受”减免税优惠，实际上是逃税。丹东市有关部门对此进行清理后，查补税款一千二百一十三万元。
    这是一例。再一例是江苏省对个体工商税收作专项检查，仅两个月就查补税款五千一百七十万元。其中武进县一个体户补交税款达三十八万元。
    上述两例说明，目前财税环节“跑、冒、滴、漏”的现象相当严重，面很广，数额大，不仅影响财政收入的稳定增长，而且扰乱了正常的经济秩序，造成社会分配不公，败坏社会风气，影响大局的稳定。
    这几年，一方面是国家财政困难，一方面是该收的没有都收上来，财政收入大量流失，一些单位或拖欠、占压税款，或弄虚作假，骗取减免税优惠；为数不少的个体工商户靠非法经营、偷税漏税发了财，严重损害国家利益。
    这些问题的出现，暴露了有关部门工作中的漏洞，如制度不严密，经管不得力等等。改变这种面貌，堵塞漏洞，国家财政增收的潜力很大。对此，应引起有关部门高度重视。要坚决按照政策办事，不乱开减免税的口子，秉公征税，不徇私情，采取有效的措施，把国家该收的全部收上来。希望各地像江苏省和丹东市那样，认真下一番功夫，清理那些该收而没有收上来的税款，并且坚决地收上来。我想，各地都这样做了，是一定能抓出成效来的。
