New China News Agency, Beijing, August 28 (Reporter Zhou Kejin) - The new chairman and acting president of Beijing Fourtone Group, Shen Guojun, recently told reporters that Fourtone has not collapsed and is not in a state of "tree falls, monkeys scatter." The company's operations are running normally.

Shen Guojun made these remarks at a press conference held by Beijing Fourtone Office Equipment Co., Ltd., a joint venture with Japanese partners, to introduce new products.

Shen Guojun said that only a very small number of people, such as Wan Runnan, were involved in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion at Fourtone. The vast majority of employees have remained at their posts. Taking Beijing Fourtone Office Equipment Co., Ltd. as an example, none of the 160 employees participated in street protests, donated money, or stopped work. Between May 20 and June 10, when many factories and enterprises saw a decline in production, this company's output increased by 31.2% compared to the same period last year. After Wan Runnan was removed from all positions in Fourtone Group and its subsidiaries and expelled from the company, Fourtone entered a new era. Currently, Fourtone's operations are running normally, and the three branches in Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia have all telegraphed the headquarters, expressing their continued acceptance of the leadership of the Beijing headquarters. The board of directors of the group recently made new decisions to make Fourtone a global company within five years. With the removal of Wan Runnan and others, Fourtone will continue to move forward.

The Japanese vice president of Beijing Fourtone Office Equipment Co., Ltd., Nakazumi Jun, also expressed his full satisfaction with the more than two years of cooperation with Fourtone and believed that the joint venture company has a bright future.

    清除万润南等几个人之后
    四通经营活动一切正常
    新华社北京8月28日电　（记者周科进）北京四通集团公司新任董事长、代理总裁沈国钧日前对记者说，四通公司没有垮台，更没有“树倒猢狲散”，公司的经营活动一切正常。
    沈国钧是在与日商合资兴办的北京四通办公设备有限公司日前召开的新产品介绍会上，发表这番讲话的。
    沈国钧说，四通公司参与动乱和反革命暴乱的只是万润南等极少数、极少数人，绝大多数职工都在坚守各自的工作岗位。以北京四通办公设备有限公司为例，160名职工，没有人上街游行，没有捐过一分钱，没有停工停产。在5月20日至6月10日，许多工厂企业产值下降，而这家公司的产值却比去年同期增加31.2％。万润南被撤销在四通集团公司及所属公司的一切职务、并被开除出四通集团公司之后，四通开始进入一个新的时期。现在，四通的经营活动一切正常，在香港、美国、澳大利亚的三个分部也都致电公司总部，表示继续接受北京总部的领导。集团公司董事会最近做出新的决策，要用5年的时间，使四通公司走向世界。清除了万润南等几个人，四通公司仍将大步前进。
    北京四通办公设备有限公司日方副总经理中込纯也表示对与四通公司两年多的合作百分之百的满意，并相信合资公司前程远大。
