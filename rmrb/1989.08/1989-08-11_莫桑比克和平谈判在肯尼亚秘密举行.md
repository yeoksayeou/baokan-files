Mozambique government and the rebel group National Resistance Movement have been holding secret talks in Kenya for the past three days to end the 14-year civil war. The outcome of the talks is not yet clear.

According to the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the talks, led by representatives of the Mozambican church on behalf of the government and personally led by rebel leader Alfonso Dhlakama, will continue. The talks, initiated by the Kenyan government, began on August 8. The Mozambican government also sent a representative to Nairobi to oversee the progress of the talks. The negotiations are expected to be based on the Mozambican government's 12-point plan, which calls for the cessation of terrorism and banditry as the first step towards peace.
