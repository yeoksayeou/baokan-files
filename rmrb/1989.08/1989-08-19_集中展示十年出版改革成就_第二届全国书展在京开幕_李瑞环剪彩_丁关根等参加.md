Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 19th.

Despite the persistent rain, the enthusiasm of the audience remained undiminished. They gathered from all corners of the country to the China International Exhibition Center in the capital to attend the opening of the second National Book Fair.

This event is a grand showcase of the achievements of a decade of publishing reforms, featuring nearly 600 publishing houses, including those from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which have meticulously selected 20,000 publications for display.

The exhibition's emblem, prominently displayed at the entrance, stands out against the backdrop of colorful banners. It depicts an open, vibrant book, symbolizing the pursuit of knowledge. Amidst joyful music, Li Ruihuan cut the red ribbon, and the crowd surged into the exhibition hall. A chart caught the attention of many visitors, detailing the progress of China's publishing industry: in 1979, there were 129 publishing houses nationwide, publishing over 17,000 books; today, the number of publishing houses has grown to 500, with an annual output of over 60,000 books.

Of course, numbers only tell part of the story. The high-quality books on display throughout the exhibition vividly illustrate the steady improvement in the quality of domestic publications. The 60-volume "Complete Collection of Chinese Art," a testament to the enduring beauty of a 5,000-year-old civilization, has been completed, serving as a significant gift to the nation on the 40th anniversary of its founding. The domestically edited Chinese version of "Lenin's Complete Works," the "Contemporary China Series," and the "World Classics in Translation" are among the many key projects that have been successfully completed. The "Encyclopedia of China," the "Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicine," and the "Flora of China" are among the flagship publications that reflect the high standards of domestic science, culture, and publishing.

Through this book fair, visitors can hear the footsteps of the nation's progress. The achievements of a decade of reform across various fronts are reflected in the publications. In particular, scientific and technological books and social science works directly serving modernization have become an important part of the publishing structure.

Breaking away from the outdated and rigid publishing management system, various publishing houses are showcasing their strengths. The exhibition hall features stands set up by the exhibitors themselves, fully demonstrating their unique advantages. This not only allows visitors to feel the vitality brought by competition in publishing but also indicates that the book industry is continuously expanding in terms of variety and scope. The three most research-valued editions of "Jin Ping Mei" have all been published, and their facsimile or printed versions are on public display for the first time at the book fair.

The publishing reforms have been fraught with challenges, and the industry has encountered some issues in its exploration. Today, Song Mumu, Director of the News and Publishing Administration, the organizing body of the book fair, expressed a willingness to use this opportunity to gather opinions from all quarters to further improve their work.

The 10-day book fair combines exhibition and sales, offering 30,000 new books for readers to choose from. Ding Guangen and other relevant officials visited the exhibition today.

    集中展示十年出版改革成就
    第二届全国书展在京开幕
    李瑞环剪彩　丁关根等参加
    新华社北京8月19日电（记者李光茹）尽管秋雨绵绵，观众的热情却依然不减。他们从祖国的四面八方汇聚到首都国际展览中心，观看今天开幕的第二届全国书展。
    这是集中展示十年出版改革成就的盛会，包括港澳台在内的近600家出版社，精挑细选了两万种出版物参展。
    展厅门前的“会标”在彩旗的映衬下格外醒目。这是一本被翻开的五彩斑斓的书。它似乎昭示着读者：向知识的高峰登攀。在欢快的乐曲声中，李瑞环同志剪断红绸，人流涌入展厅。一张表格吸引了不少参观者，上面记载着中国出版业的进展：1979年全国有出版社129家，年出版图书1.7万多种；而今出版社已发展到500家，年出书6万多种。
    当然，数字只能说明一个方面。而综合馆内的一部部“高水准”图书却形象地表明：国内图书质量正在稳步提高。堪称五千年文明不朽的美的《中国美术全集》60卷已全部出齐，这是出版工作者献给建国40周年的一份厚礼；我国自行编辑的中文版《列宁全集》、《当代中国丛书》、《汉译世界学术名著丛书》等一批批“重点工程”相继完成；《中国大百科全书》、《中国医药百科全书》、《中国植物志》等“重头货”体现了国内科学文化和出版的水平。
    透过书展这个窗口，观众可以听到祖国前进的脚步声。各条战线十年改革所取得的成果，在出版物中均有体现。特别是直接为现代化建设服务的科学技术图书和社会科学著作，已成为出书结构中的重要组成部门。
    突破了落后、僵化的出版管理体制，各出版社竞显身手。版别馆内由参展者自设展台，充分显示了各自的优势，不仅让人感受到出版竞争带来的活力，也表明图书领域、品种不断拓宽。学界公认的三个最具研究价值的《金瓶梅》版本，已全部推出，它的影印本或排印本在书展上第一次公开露面。
    出版改革充满艰辛，出版界在摸索中也出现了一些问题。书展的主办单位新闻出版署署长宋木文今天表示：愿借这个机会，听取各界意见，以进一步改进工作。
    为期10天的书展实行展览与销售并举，有3万种新书供读者选购。丁关根及有关方面负责同志今天参观了展览。
