    Rakowski Accuses Walesa of Tearing Up Round Table Agreement
    Two Small Parties Willing to Form Government with Solidarity

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 16th (Reporter Tang Deqiao) — On the 16th, the first secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, Rakowski, accused the chairman of Solidarity, Walesa, of "tearing up the Round Table Agreement" and "destroying the balance of political forces in Poland."

    Rakowski pointed out that the current domestic situation is "rapidly changing," and the opposition is accelerating the process of seizing power. He said, "We face the threat of the Round Table Agreement being destroyed," and the situation is even more severe due to the complex situation within the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party's parliamentary groups.

    According to reports, the United Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party's parliamentary groups passed a resolution on the 16th, requesting that the central committees of the two parties accept Walesa's suggestion for Solidarity, the United Peasants' Party, and the Democratic Party to form a joint government, and submit an application to the President of the Republic.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 16th — The Presidium of the Polish United Peasants' Party Central Committee and the Presidium of the Democratic Party Central Committee held meetings on the 16th, expressing their support for the two parties to organize the government together with representatives of Solidarity.

    These two parties have long cooperated with the Polish United Workers' Party in governing. However, on August 7th, the leader of Solidarity, Walesa, proposed in a statement that Solidarity and these two parties form a joint government, excluding the Polish United Workers' Party, despite the fact that the United Workers' Party has been seeking to organize a grand coalition government that includes various forces.

    On the same day, the Solidarity Citizens' Parliamentary Group held a meeting. At the meeting, Walesa issued a statement, expressing that he had never intended to become the prime minister and still has no such intention.

    拉科夫斯基指责瓦文萨
    撕毁圆桌会议协议
    波两小党愿与团结工会一起组阁
    新华社华沙8月16日电　（记者汤德乔）波兰统一工人党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基16日在波兰统一工人党议员团会议上指责团结工会主席瓦文萨“撕毁圆桌会议协议”，“破坏波兰政治力量的对比”。
    拉科夫斯基指出，目前国内形势“瞬息多变”，反对派加速了夺权的进程。他说，我们“面临圆桌会议协议被破坏的威胁”，而形势由于统一农民党和民主党议员团内出现的复杂情况而更加严峻。
    据报道，统一农民党和民主党议员团16日通过决议，要求两党中央接受瓦文萨关于团结工会、统一农民党、民主党联合组阁的建议，并向共和国总统提出申请。
    新华社华沙8月16日电　波兰统一农民党最高委员会主席团和民主党中央委员会主席团16日分别开会，表示赞成该两党与团结工会代表一起组织政府。
    这两个政党长期与波兰统一工人党合作执政。而团结工会领导人瓦文萨在8月7日的声明中提出由团结工会同这两个党组织联合政府，把波兰统一工人党排斥在外，尽管统一工人党一直在谋求组织包括各种力量的大联合政府。
    同日，团结工会的公民国会议员团召开了会议。会上瓦文萨发表了一项声明，表示他从来没有打算当总理，现在仍然没有这种打算。
