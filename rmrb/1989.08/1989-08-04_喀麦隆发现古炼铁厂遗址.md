Cameroon archaeologists recently discovered an ancient iron smelting site near the capital city of Yaounde. This archaeological discovery pushes back the Iron Age in Central Africa by several hundred years.

Previously, the earliest known iron smelting site in Central Africa was in Nigeria's Nok, dating back to the 6th-7th century BC. The Yaounde site, however, dates back to the 11th century BC. The authoritative laboratory at the University of Miami in the United States confirmed the age of the samples from this site, verifying the archaeologists' findings.

    喀麦隆发现古炼铁厂遗址
    新华社雅温得8月2日电  喀麦隆考古学家最近在喀麦隆首都雅温得附近发现了一座古炼铁厂遗址。这一考古新发现将中部非洲的铁器时代提前了数百年。
    在此之前，世界公认非洲中部地区最早的古铁厂遗址在尼日利亚的诺可，其年代为公元前6世纪—7世纪。而雅温得这座古炼铁厂建于公元前十一世纪。颇具权威的美国迈阿密大学实验室对该遗址标本的化验结果证实了考古学家的这一推断。
