Chinese athletes have achieved a victory at the World University Games. Huang Zhihong won the gold medal in the women's shot put event with a throw of 20.56 meters, defeating 14 athletes from 11 countries. Her teammate Zhou Tianhua secured the bronze medal with a throw of 18.71 meters. This marks China's first gold medal and second bronze medal at the Duisburg Games. The silver medal was won by Cuba's Berjis Lazaro.

Huang Zhihong and Zhou Tianhua were not entirely satisfied with yesterday's performance. In recent training sessions, Huang had thrown over 21 meters several times. She mentioned that the rainy weather caused her old knee injury to flare up, while Zhou Tianhua had a cold. The cheerful Huang Zhihong, 24 years old, hails from Jin Hua, Zhejiang, standing at 1.74 meters tall and weighing 100 kilograms. Zhou Tianhua, 23, from Jiangsu, has been training in shot put for nine years. After receiving their awards, the crowd of over 10,000 spectators applauded enthusiastically. Huang Zhihong joyfully threw her bouquet into the stands.

Chinese male long jump athletes Ma Minggui and Liang Chao both qualified for the finals. Female high jump athletes Wang Wei and Jin Ling also successfully qualified for the finals. Pole vaulter Yuan Shun'en failed to reach the qualifying height of 5 meters and did not advance. Male 400-meter hurdler Zhao Cunlin also failed to qualify in the preliminaries.

Yesterday saw the finals for men's hammer throw, 20-kilometer race walk, and women's shot put, as well as the preliminaries for men's 100 meters, 400-meter hurdles, long jump, pole vault, and women's 100 meters, 400 meters, and high jump.

The gold medal in the men's hammer throw was won by Soviet athlete Igor Astapkovich, with West Germany's Heinrich Weiss taking the silver. The gold medal in the 20-kilometer race walk was won by Italy's Walter Arena, who also set a new World University Games record with a time of 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 25 seconds. The silver medal was won by Spain's Miguel Prieto.

Apart from the mentioned athletes, China did not enter any other events yesterday. In the men's 100-meter preliminaries, American athlete Andre Carson tied the World University Games record with a time of 10.07 seconds.

Additionally, all individual fencing events at the World University Games concluded yesterday. In the men's épée event, Cuba's Carlos Pedroso defeated Italy's Maurizio Randazzo to win the gold medal.

Chinese athlete Ma Zhi consecutively defeated athletes from Spain, Italy, and Cuba, advancing to the top 8. He was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Hungary's Banzi.

    黄志红和周天华对昨天的成绩并不十分满意。在最近几天的训练中，她曾几次投到21米以上。她说，昨天的阴雨天气使她的膝盖旧伤又隐隐作痛，周天华也患了感冒。性格开朗的黄志红脸上总是挂着笑容，她今年24岁，浙江金华人，身高1.74米，体重100公斤；周天华23岁，江苏人，练铅球已经9年。她俩领奖后，全场1万余观众报以热烈掌声，黄志红高兴地把花束抛向看台。
    中国男子跳远运动员马明贵和梁超双双通过资格赛。女子跳高运动员王薇和金玲也顺利通过资格赛，从而取得决赛权。撑竿跳运动员袁顺恩在试跳5米高度时失利，未能达到及格标准，男子400米中栏运动员赵存林也在预赛中失利。
    昨天举行了男子链球、20公里竞走和女子铅球的决赛以及男子100米、400米中栏、跳远、撑竿跳和女子100米、400米、跳高的预赛。
    获男子链球金牌的是苏联运动员伊戈尔·阿斯塔普科维奇，西德的海因利希·魏斯获亚军。20公里竞走金牌被意大利瓦尔特·阿雷那夺走，他同时以1小时23分25秒的成绩刷新了世界大学生运动会的纪录，银牌获得者是西班牙的米盖尔·普里埃托。
    除上面提到的运动员之外，我国未报名参加昨天其他项目的比赛。在昨天的男子100米预赛中，美国黑人运动员安德列·卡森以10秒07的成绩平世界大学生运动会纪录。
    另外，世界大学生运动会的击剑个人比赛项目昨天全部结束。在男子重剑项目中，古巴的卡尔洛斯·佩德罗索战胜意大利的毛里齐奥·兰达佐，荣获金牌。
    中国运动员马志先后战胜了西班牙、意大利和古巴运动员，进入前8名行列，在四分之一决赛中负于匈牙利运动员班齐克。
