Two U.S. professors have released a report stating that the number of homeless and near-homeless people in the United States has been increasing throughout the 1980s, drawing significant public attention. According to a report published on August 8 by two professors from Rutgers University, the current estimate of the homeless population ranges from 650,000 to 4,000,000. Additionally, there are 4,000,000 to 14,000,000 Americans who are "on the brink of homelessness," often having to stay with relatives or friends.

The report states that if the U.S. experiences a mild economic recession, the number of homeless could double or even triple.

The authors believe that such a large number of people on the brink of homelessness reflects housing shortages and economic issues present in the U.S. during the 1980s. They note that economic growth has slowed, and the Reagan administration has significantly reduced funding for constructing low-income housing, causing many families to be near homelessness. Due to high interest rates, housing prices, and construction costs, many low-income working families cannot afford to rent homes. As for those who end up on the streets every day, many are working adults and their families. According to some survey reports, 30% of the homeless are families with children.

### 美两教授发表报告称  当今美国无家可归者增加

    美两教授发表报告称
    当今美国无家可归者增加
    本报华盛顿电　80年代，美国无家可归者和近于无家可归者的人数俱增，引起美国公众的极大关注。据8月8日发表的一份由拉特杰尔斯大学两位教授撰写的报告称，目前对无家可归者人数的估计通常在65万至400万之间，但另有400万至1400万美国人“正在无家可归的边缘挣扎”，他们常常只能寄居在亲友家中。
    报告说，如果美国出现一次轻微的经济衰退，无家可归者就会增加一倍至两倍。
    作者认为，如此庞大的近于无家可归的队伍反映出住宅短缺和80年代美国存在的经济问题。作者说，近几年来，经济增长减慢，里根政府大量削减建造低收入者住房的经费，使许多家庭近于无家可归。由于利率高、房价和造价高，许多低收入职工家庭租不起房子。至于每天流落街头的无家可归者，有不少是有工作的成年人及其家庭。据一些调查报告，有30％的无家可归者是有子女的家庭。
