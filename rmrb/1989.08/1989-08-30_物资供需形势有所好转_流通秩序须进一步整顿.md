	The supply and demand situation of materials has improved; circulation order needs further rectification

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th: Reporters Zhang Guorong and Wang Jinhu reported: The spokesperson for the Ministry of Materials, Xie Minggan, reported on the supply and demand and circulation situation of materials in our country today. Currently, the supply-demand relationship of major production materials in the country has eased, prices have stabilized, and the situation is better than initially anticipated at the beginning of the year. However, the chaotic situation of the circulation of important materials has not fundamentally changed, and the task of cleaning up and rectifying remains arduous.

	According to the introduction, since the second quarter of this year, most materials have increased compared to the same period last year, and social demand has been somewhat compressed. The tight supply situation of energy and some raw materials has eased. The allocation and supply of materials are relatively good. From January to July, material enterprises purchased a total of 129.14 billion yuan and sold 139.44 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% and 5% respectively compared to the same period last year. The social inventory of important materials has increased. The market prices of 15 types of materials such as thick and medium plates, wire rods, rubber, and cement have fallen.

	The main problems currently are: first, the resources directly controlled by the state have decreased, and the ability of macro-control has weakened. Second, the difficulty of resource allocation has increased, and after the expansion of enterprise self-sales, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises find it difficult to obtain resources from the market. Third, the prices of production materials remain high, with coal prices rising sharply, up by 54.8% compared to the same period last year, of which market prices have risen by 91.5%. Fourth, the circulation order has not fundamentally improved, with too many and too many operating units, and party and government agencies have not yet been cleaned up. Fifth, the physical purchase and sales volume of state-owned material enterprises has decreased, and economic benefits have declined. Some mechanical and electrical products, small cars, and chemical products are stagnant and accumulated.

	In response, the Ministry of Materials proposed the following strategies: according to the principle of combining planned economy with market regulation and the current requirements of rectification and improvement, appropriately increase the proportion of important materials controlled by the state to ensure key needs; strictly implement mandatory plans and strengthen the management of allocated materials; solve the problem of too many intermediate links and layer-by-layer price increases.

### 物资供需形势有所好转  流通秩序须进一步整顿

    物资供需形势有所好转  流通秩序须进一步整顿
    本报北京8月30日讯　记者张国荣、王锦鹄报道：物资部新闻发言人谢明干今天在这里通报了我国物资供需和流通情况。目前，国内主要生产资料的供求关系有所缓和，价格趋于稳定，形势比年初预料的要好，但重要物资流通秩序混乱的状况尚未根本扭转，清理整顿的任务仍很艰巨。
    据介绍，今年进入二季度以来，多数物资比去年同期增加，社会需求有所压缩，能源和部分原材料供应紧张状况有所缓和。物资分配和供应较好，1至7月份，物资企业共购进1291.4亿元，销售1394.4亿元，比去年同期分别增长10.4％和5％。重要物资社会库存量增加。中厚钢板、线材、橡胶、水泥等15种物资市场价格下降。
    当前主要存在的问题：一是国家直接掌握的资源减少，宏观调控能力削弱。二是资源配置难度增大，企业自销扩大后，国营大中型企业难以从市场得到资源。三是生产资料价格仍较高，突出的是煤价涨势猛，比去年同期上升54.8％，其中市场价上升91.5％。四是流通秩序还没有根本好转，经营单位过多过滥，党政机关办公司仍未清理。五是国营物资企业实物购销量减少，经济效益下降。部分机电产品、小汽车及化工产品滞销积压。
    为此，物资部提出的对策是，根据计划经济与市场调节相结合的原则和当前治理整顿的要求，适当提高国家掌握重要物资的比重，保证重点需要；严肃指令性计划，加强统配物资管理；解决中间环节过多，层层加价的问题。
