New York, August 29 (Xinhua) - Reporter Liu Kai Chen reports: The Zhongbao published here today issued an editorial exposing that a small group of people, including Wu'erkaixi and Yan Jiajie, who fled overseas, claiming to be the "reincarnation of Sun Yat-sen," are "attempting to distort history and confuse the overseas Chinese in order to elevate their own status and fish in troubled waters."

The editorial elaborates on the significance of the Xinhai Revolution, the support and contributions of the overseas Chinese to the revolution, and points out, "The common wish of the broad masses of overseas Chinese at that time was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty's imperial rule so that the motherland could embark on the path of democracy and prosperity."

The editorial emphasizes, "From the establishment of the Xingzhonghui to the present, nearly a century has passed. China has undergone earth-shaking changes. Any Chinese person with common sense and conscience will agree that China is no longer a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country where people are at the mercy of others. The fact that the Chinese people have stood up is something that even foreigners cannot deny. To be fair, the Three Principles of the People advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen—nationalism has undoubtedly been fully realized, the problem of people's livelihood has been basically solved, and democracy is being promoted and will be perfected with time."

"The three million overseas Chinese and Chinese descendants' love for their motherland and their common aspiration for the prosperity of the motherland and the well-being of the people are completely consistent with those of a century ago. They absolutely cannot be divided and deceived by a small group of people who bow and scrape to foreigners. We believe that the broad masses of overseas Chinese and Chinese descendants have the correct understanding, that is, today's China is not the China of the Xinhai Revolution period. How can we defame China, which adheres to the policy of independence and self-reliance and has risen to the ranks of the world, as the 'late Qing Dynasty on the verge of extinction'? How can we allow those who use 'mouse tricks and tiger names' to impersonate the 'reincarnation of Sun Yat-sen' and defame the great image of Mr. Sun? We must uphold the purpose of the Xingzhonghui to 'revitalize China,' distinguish right from wrong, uphold the truth, further carry forward the glorious patriotic tradition of the overseas Chinese, and shoulder with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland the great historical mission of revitalizing China!"

    纽约《中报》社论指出
    少数败类骗不了海外华侨
    本报纽约8月29日电  记者刘开宸报道：这里的《中报》今天发表社论，揭露吾尔开希、严家其等一小撮人逃亡海外后以“孙中山再世”自居是“妄图以歪曲历史、迷惑侨众为手段，达到抬高身价、混水摸鱼的目标。”
    社论详细阐明辛亥革命的意义、华侨对革命的支持和贡献后指出，“广大华侨当年的共同心愿是推翻满清帝制，俾祖国走上民主、富强的道路”。
    社论强调，“从兴中会创立时以迄今天，已将近一个世纪。中国发生了惊天动地的变化。任何一个有常识、有良知的中国人都会同意中国已不是半封建、半殖民地、人为刀俎，我为鱼肉的国家。中国人民站起来了这一形态，是连外国人也不得不承认的。平情而论，孙中山先生所倡导的三民主义，民族主义无疑是完全实现了，民生主义问题基本上获得解决，民权主义则在推进中，必须假以时日才能完善。”
    “海外三千多万华侨和华裔热爱祖国的心态以及期望祖国富强和人民康乐的共同愿望和一个世纪前是完全一致的，绝对不是一小撮向洋人卑躬屈膝、俯首称臣之辈所能分化和蒙骗的。我们认为广大侨胞和华裔均有正确的认识，那便是今天的中国决非辛亥革命时期的中国，岂可将坚持独立自主政策、跻身于世界之林的中国污辱为‘灭亡前的晚清’，更可容‘鼠技虎名’之辈冒充‘孙中山再世’，污辱孙先生的伟大形象？！我们必须弘扬兴中会‘振兴中华’的宗旨，明辨是非、坚持真理，进一步发扬华侨光荣的爱国传统，同祖国各族人民负起振兴中华的伟大历史使命！”
