For some time, ideological and political work in schools has not been in place and has not played its due role. What is the problem?

Biological senior teacher and principal of Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School, Zhu Zhengwei, shared his views when interviewed by reporter Su Ting of the China Education News. The following is a summary.

	“The college entrance examination baton” has explicitly or implicitly weakened ideological and political work. The reflection on the ten years of turmoil has made us realize the importance of science and technology, raising the status of knowledge. However, there has been a tendency to pursue high admission rates one-sidedly. Now, although schools advocate “moral, intellectual, and physical education should be developed comprehensively,” in practice, intellectual education is often placed in the highest position. In schools like ours, if the admission rate drops, it will affect the school's reputation and immediately affect the next year's enrollment. Thus, academic performance becomes the first priority, schools compete on admission rates, and key middle schools even compete on the number of students admitted to key universities like Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University. Higher authorities also often use admission rates as a standard to evaluate the work of schools. In this way, middle and primary school teachers, unwillingly and helplessly, follow this baton, and the importance of moral education is inevitably diluted.

	In political and ideological work, the first thing to emphasize should be principles, that is, the content of education, and only then the methods and approaches. We often advocate that ideological education should be integrated with entertainment. Teachers are always concerned that students might not like it or listen to it. Youth League activities seem to be just holding dances and organizing outings. As a result, various methods and approaches are used, but the principles are ignored, leading to situations where teachers talk positively in class, and students make noise below.

	Another issue is the lack of strictness. Nowadays, students are often pampered from a young age, becoming the little sun in the family, gradually forming a self-centered consciousness, to the extent that they consider themselves the elite of society after entering university. This is also related to some confusion in the thoughts of educators. The whole society lacks strict requirements for teenagers in terms of ideology and life, resulting in students relaxing their thoughts, making mistakes, and even teachers and parents pleading for leniency, unable to handle the situation seriously.

	Currently, schools have only carried out structural reforms and management system reforms, but have not deeply reformed education thoughts, education and teaching contents, curriculum structures, and examination systems. Students only focus on hard work, and ideological education is not given its due position.

    中学德育教育位置倾斜
    一个时期以来，在教育人的学校里，思想政治工作总不到位，没有起到应有的作用，这到底是什么地方出了漏洞？
    生物特级教师、北京师范大学附中校长朱正威在接受《中国教育报》记者苏婷采访时谈了他的看法。现摘要如下。
      “高考指挥棒”有形无形地削弱了思想政治工作。对十年动乱反思的结果，使我们认识到了科学技术的重要性，提高了知识的地位。但是，又出现了片面追求升学率的倾向。现在，虽然学校里都提“德智体要全面发展”，而在实际中却常常是把智育放到至高无上的位置。像我们这样的重点学校，如果升学率下降，就要影响学校的声誉，并马上影响到下一届招生的生源。于是功课成了第一位的东西，学校之间比升学率，重点中学之间还要比升入北大、清华、人大等重点高校的人数，上面也常以升学率做为标准来评价学校的工作。这样，中、小学教师身不由己、迫不得已地随着这根指挥棒转，德育工作的重要性必然被冲淡了。
    在政治思想工作中，首先应该强调原则，即教育的内容，次之才是教育的方式方法。我们经常宣传思想教育要寓教于乐，老师在讲课时也总担心，顾虑学生不爱听、听不进；共青团活动似乎就是开舞会、搞郊游，结果是想尽各种方式方法，却忽略了原则，以致有的老师在课堂上讲正面的话，下面学生就起哄。
    再有就是不严格。现在的学生从小就被捧着，在家中是小太阳，渐渐地形成了自我为中心的意识，以致他们在上大学后，就把自己看成是社会的精英。这也同我们教育者思想上的某些混乱有关。我们全社会对青少年在思想和生活上都缺乏严格要求，因此造成学生在思想上放松自己，犯了错误，甚至有老师、家长说情，不能严肃处理。
    在学校中，目前只搞了结构改革、管理体制改革，而没有深入到教育思想、教育教学内容、课程结构、考试制度等方面的改革，学生只专注于苦学，思想教育便放不到应有的位置上。
