Today, the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court and the People's Courts of Xincheng, Baqiao, and Yanta Districts publicly handed down first-instance verdicts to some of the criminals involved in the "April 22" disturbances. Six defendants in six cases were sentenced to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment; Li Jun and Li Zehua were exempted from criminal penalties.

On April 22 this year, a serious incident of smashing, looting, and arson occurred at Xincheng Square in Xi'an. Ke Ruiyang, a temporary worker at Xi'an Environmental Protection Boiler Company, provoked trouble and insulted police officers on duty at the square. He repeatedly attacked armed police and public security officers with bricks and stones, causing chaos. Together with other thugs, he pushed over the west wall of the provincial government building and then rushed into the provincial procuratorate and court, smashing the windows of a passenger truck and overturning it with others. Ke then, along with other thugs, surrounded and attacked a tourist car carrying overseas Chinese. The Xi'an Intermediate People's Court sentenced Ke Ruiyang to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life for hooliganism.

On the afternoon of April 22, Zhang Bingbing, a contract worker at the Installation Team of the Third Construction Company of Shaanxi Province, smashed the rear window of a truck's cab with a brick. Zhang Bingbing also, along with other thugs, knocked down the west wall of the provincial government. Zhang Bingbing was sentenced to 16 years in prison for arson and hooliganism, with the deprivation of political rights for three years.

On the same afternoon, the unemployed youth Fan Changjiang took advantage of the chaos to break into a residential household west of the West Gate of Xincheng Square, stealing five audio tapes. He twice broke into "Tiantian Clothing Store" to commit robbery and was sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprivation of political rights for three years.

Additionally, Wang Zunning and Xiao Sanfeng, farmers from Lantian County, Zhao Jun'an, a temporary worker at Xi'an Metallurgical and Building Materials Institute, and Sun Chaohui, a temporary worker at the Morning Bell Store of the Surveying and Mapping Institute of Xi'an, who participated in the smashing, looting, and arson, were each sentenced to four and three years in prison for disrupting public order.
