An important meeting was held from July 24 to 26 in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, marking the 25th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The main topics of this summit were the independence of Namibia and the economic crisis in Africa. The summit adopted a declaration on the last colony in Africa, Namibia, and a series of resolutions aimed at addressing the economic crises that plague most African countries.

Since its establishment in 1963, the OAU has helped 19 African countries achieve independence from colonial rule, nearly completing its historical mission of decolonization. Now, it is necessary to concretely address economic issues to consolidate the achievements made in the political arena.

The newly elected chairman of the OAU, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said at the closing meeting that this summit is a turning point for Africa's march towards a brighter future.

Although the OAU has been working on solving Africa's economic problems since 1973, the unreasonable international economic order has not only made the achievements minimal but has also deepened Africa's economic crisis. The Lagos Plan of Action, adopted in 1980, has not been effectively implemented because the worsening economic crisis has forced African decision-makers to respond to the crisis and accept externally imposed structural adjustment programs as a condition for obtaining further aid.

As a result, Africa's economy has experienced significant setbacks in all areas of social and economic development, including production and income, capital structure, imports, and exports. The trade deficit has increased. Inflation and debt repayment have risen. Non-industrialization has led to the dispersion rather than accumulation of capital on an unprecedented scale, becoming a common phenomenon in African countries.

While considering the national liberation movement, African leaders have found that their independent economic decisions have been disrupted. As the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and economist Adebayo Adedeji said, the increasing influence of foreign experts and managers in the decision-making domain has not only undermined national sovereignty but also disrupted policy continuity. He said that in Africa, the scope for formulating independent policies and national economic management is becoming increasingly narrow.

Reality has forced African leaders to recall a proposition: without economic independence, political independence cannot be completed. This is a proposition put forward by one of the founders of the OAU, Kwame Nkrumah.

The OAU's resolution on accelerating the establishment of an African Economic Community and the resolution on choosing structural adjustment programs as the overall policy for national economic reform are evidence of this. African leaders in their speeches supported Africa's choice of structural adjustment programs.

Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said at the beginning of this year: "The challenge facing Africa today is to liberate itself from the economic hegemony imposed by the developed North on Africa. Regardless of the cost, Africa must accept this challenge." The Minister of Development in the Zimbabwean presidency, Enos Nkala, said: "We have won the political war, but now we need to win the economic war with computers and brains."

The newly elected Secretary-General of the OAU, Tanzanian Vice President Salim Ahmed Salim, said that this process has just truly begun. This process is long and fraught with difficulties, requiring unyielding spirit. But there is no other choice.

    一次重要的会议
    新华社记者　金绍卿
    非洲统一组织第二十五届国家和政府首脑会议七月二十四日至二十六日在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴举行。
    纳米比亚独立和非洲经济危机是这次会议的主要议题。本届首脑会议通过了关于非洲最后一块殖民地纳米比亚宣言和一系列旨在摆脱困扰大多数非洲国家经济危机的决议。
    非统组织自一九六三年成立后的二十六年里，帮助十九个非洲国家摆脱了殖民主义统治，几乎完成了它的非殖民化历史使命，现在有必要切实具体地解决经济问题。这将有助于巩固在政治领域里所取得的成就。
    新当选的非统组织主席、埃及总统穆巴拉克在闭幕会议上说，这次会议是非洲走向更光明未来的转折点。
    尽管非统组织从一九七三年开始着手解决非洲大陆的经济问题，但是不合理的国际经济秩序不但使取得的成绩甚微，而且加深了非洲的经济危机。一九八○年通过的拉格斯行动计划没有能很好地执行，因为日益严重的经济危机迫使非洲决策者们陷入应付危机，接受外部强加的结构调整计划，以此作为获得进一步援助的条件。
    其结果，非洲经济在产量和收入、资本构成、进出口等所有社会和经济发展领域中产生了重大的倒退，有时甚至是严峻的。国际收支赤字增加。通货膨胀和债务还本付息增加。非工业化在前所未有的规模上进行资本分散而不是积累已经成为非洲国家的普遍现象。
    非洲国家领导人在考虑民族解放运动的同时，他们发现独立的经济决策遭到破坏。正像联合国非洲经济委员会执行秘书、经济学家阿德德吉所说，外国专家和管理人员直接和间接地在国家决策领域中作用的扩大不仅破坏了国家的主权，而且还破坏了政策的延续性。他说，在非洲，制订独立政策和国家经济管理的范围越来越窄小。
    现实迫使非洲国家领导人想起了一个论断：没有经济独立政治独立也不能完成。这是非统组织的创始人之一恩克鲁玛提出的。
    非统组织通过的关于加速建立非洲经济共同体决议和关于选择结构调整计划作为各国经济改革的总方针的决议就是明证。非洲国家国家领导人在发言中赞成非洲选择结构调整计划。
    赞比亚总统卡翁达今年初说：“非洲今天面临的挑战是把自己从发达的北方强加给非洲的经济霸权中解放出来。不管什么代价，非洲必须接受这一挑战”。津巴布韦总统府负责发展的部长恩科莫说：“我们已经赢得了政治战争，但是我们现在需要用计算机和大脑赢得经济战争。”
    新当选的非统组织秘书长、坦桑尼亚副总理萨利姆说，这个进程刚刚真正开始。这个进程是漫长的，充满了困难，需要不屈不挠的精神。但没有其他选择的余地。
