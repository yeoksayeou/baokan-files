    Treating Pollution Control as a Mandatory Task
    Shanghai and Shaanxi Set Environmental Protection Goals

    Shanghai, August 23 (Xinhua) — Shanghai Municipal Government announced yesterday that the overall environmental protection goal for this term is to prioritize water source protection and strive to control the development of environmental pollution.

    In recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Government has attached great importance to environmental protection work, and the trend of deteriorating environmental quality has been somewhat mitigated. However, the environmental problems facing Shanghai are still very severe. The issue of drinking water sources, which is of great concern to the public, has not been fundamentally resolved. The ecological environment in the suburbs continues to deteriorate, and air pollution is also very serious.

    To improve the environmental quality, the Shanghai Municipal Government has implemented an environmental target responsibility system. Recently, Mayor Zhu Rongji pointed out specific names of the heads of major polluters at a field meeting on the protection of water sources upstream of the Huangpu River, ordering that pollution control targets must be completed by 1990, otherwise the heads will be held accountable.

    At yesterday's municipal environmental protection work conference, the municipal government has issued the environmental goal of controlling the emission of pollutants in the city from 1990 to 1992 at the 1982 level as a mandatory task to the district and county governments and relevant bureaus, and will decompose and implement the indicators layer by layer.

    Xian, August 23 (Xinhua) — At the recently concluded Fifth Environmental Protection Conference of Shaanxi Province, the Shaanxi Provincial Government signed environmental protection target responsibility agreements with eight cities including Xi'an, Baoji, Weinan, and Yan'an for the years 1989 to 1990.

    The specific environmental protection goals set by the Shaanxi Provincial Government by 1992 are: the total concentration of suspended particulates in the air of 11 cities in the province will be reduced by 20% to 25%; the prevention and control of pollution in the Wei River and its tributaries will be strengthened, the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial waste will reach 21%, the noise source compliance rate will be 50% to 70%, the forest coverage rate will increase from 29.5% to 33%, and the area of ecological agriculture will reach more than 500,000 mu.

    把治理污染当做硬任务
    上海陕西确定环保目标
    本报上海8月23日电　记者萧关根报道：上海市政府昨天宣布，本届政府的环境保护总目标是，以保护水源为重点，努力控制环境污染的发展。
    近年来，上海市政府十分重视环保工作，环境质量恶化趋势有所缓和，但是上海面临的环境问题仍十分严峻，市民十分关心的饮用水源还没有根本解决，郊县生态环境继续在恶化，大气污染也很严重。
    为改善环境质量，上海市政府实行了环境目标责任制。前不久，朱熔基市长在黄浦江上游水源保护现场会上对国家污染大户的厂长逐一点名，限令治污目标必须在1990年前完成，否则要追究厂长责任。
    在昨天召开的市环保工作会议上，市政府已将1990年至1992年全市污染物排放量控制在1982年水平的环境目标作为指令性任务，下达给各区县政府和各主管局，并将层层分解指标落实考核。
    本报西安8月23日电　记者孟西安报道：在日前结束的陕西省第五次环境保护会议上，陕西省政府与西安、宝鸡、渭南、延安等8个地市签订了1989年至1990年环境保护目标责任书。
    陕西省政府确定的到1992年的环境保护的具体目标是：全省11个城市大气总悬浮微粒浓度下降20％至25％；抓好渭河以及支流的污染防治，工业废渣综合利用率达到21％，噪声源达标率50％至70％，森林覆盖率由29.5％提高到33％，生态农业面积达50万亩以上。
