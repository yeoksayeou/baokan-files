	Voyager 2 Discovers Ice Volcanoes on Triton

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 25th – The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that the space probe Voyager 2 has discovered that Triton, a moon of Neptune, has volcanoes that once erupted with molten ice.

	Scientists examining photos taken by Voyager 2 as it flew past Triton on the 25th discovered that Triton has three such volcanoes, though they are now inactive. These volcanoes once erupted molten ice, which could be frozen natural gas or nitrogen.

	Scientists in charge of the Voyager 2 project stated that while they had previously observed ice flows on Uranus' moon Titania and other satellites, this is the first time ice volcanoes have been discovered.

	Scientists also found from other photos sent back by Voyager 2 that Triton has long fault lines, ridges, overhanging rocks, various ice structures, and even an atmosphere. The composition of this atmosphere is currently undetermined.

    “旅行者二”号发现海卫一上有冰火山
    新华社华盛顿8月25日电　美国宇航局宣布，“旅行者2”号太空探测器发现海王星的卫星海卫一上有曾经喷出过冰熔岩的火山。
    科学家们从“旅行者2”号25日掠过海卫一时拍摄的照片上发现，海卫一有3个这类的火山，但现都已不活动了。它们曾经喷出过冰熔岩。这种冰熔岩可能是冰冻的天然气或氮气。
    负责“旅行者2”号项目的科学家说，尽管以前他们看到过天王星的卫星天卫一和一些其它卫星上有过冰流，但发现冰火山这还是第一次。
    科学家们从“旅行者2”号发回的其它照片中还发现，海卫一上有很长的断层线，山脊、低悬岩和各种冰结构，而且还有大气，其成分目前还不能立即确定。
