Beijing, July 12th - The Capital Entrepreneurs Club and Renmin University of China jointly held a seminar to study the documents of the 14th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and to deepen educational reforms. The entrepreneurs attending the seminar were all university graduates. They expressed their views on the deepening of educational reforms from the perspective of the enterprise's need for talent.

**Firm and Correct Political Direction**

Yuan Baohua (President of Renmin University of China, Advisor to the Capital Entrepreneurs Club): The Beijing student movement was initially taken over by a few conspirators and developed into turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. Even in a university like Renmin University, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition and a strong party organization, various problems emerged during this turmoil. Some young students, especially graduate students, and some young teachers have serious tendencies towards bourgeois liberalization. This is a matter worth pondering. Many outstanding students were cultivated in an environment where grades are everything and intelligence is paramount, which in fact deviates from the Party's educational policy.

Zheng Huaming (General Manager of Beijing Automobile Industry Corporation): The kind of college students that enterprises welcome should first have a firm and correct political direction and solve the problem of what to do and for whom to do it. Our company is a Sino-American joint venture. Some college students come here to do translation work. Once they are proficient in business and improve their language skills, they run off to America. Some people take on projects and sign contracts worth millions of yuan, and as soon as they get an opportunity, they leave without any sense of responsibility. This year in June, we sent a delegation to the United States, and a graduate student who had been in the factory for half a year left a note and disappeared. Sino-American joint ventures have become a springboard for them to fly abroad. Although they have knowledge and talent, they have not solved the problem of what to do and for whom to do it. Our universities are after all for cultivating talents for socialism, and college students should serve the country. If things continue this way, the college students nurtured with the blood and sweat of the people will end up making others rich, and at worst, they will become gravediggers for us.

I feel that schools have the responsibility to cultivate students' sense of social responsibility and strong sense of duty. If everyone shapes themselves according to their own will, China will still be a loose sand.

Li Dalin (Director of Beijing Construction Engineering Machinery Factory): Recently, after talking with some job-seeking college students, I found that they care more about their personal material interests than about the development of the enterprise and the future of the country. As soon as they enter the door, they ask if the enterprise has the possibility of Sino-foreign joint ventures, if there are opportunities to go abroad, how many houses there are, how much salary and benefits there are, and if the work is comfortable. Last year, with great difficulty, we recruited a student majoring in finance and assigned him to the planning department. After working for half a year, he went to Hong Kong.

Xia Jue (Chairman of Beijing KFC Limited Company): Some college graduates have strong desires for power and money, but their sense of duty and discipline is poor. Our company is a Sino-foreign joint venture, and the monthly salary of employees is three to four hundred yuan. Recently, several graduate students majoring in chemistry and agricultural technology wanted to work in our company as service staff, saying that being a professor or associate professor is not much different. I don't think being a service staff is lowly, but the country has nurtured you for so many years in a profession, you should have some sense of duty! KFC Company has strict requirements for reputation and quality. Products that exceed two hours must be discarded, and they must not be distributed to employees. They think that if 10 leftover chickens are distributed today, then 20 will be left tomorrow. This way of doing things can make production more planned. Two of our college students who majored in foreign languages openly violated this order, distributed the unsold chickens to employees, and publicly flaunted themselves with fried chicken, resulting in their dismissal.

**Insert into the Grassroots to Struggle**

Li Dalin: After graduating from university, I went to the army in 1968 to train and reform my old thoughts. Two years of military life, training, cleaning toilets, plowing fields, I have done all kinds of work. Although there were some "leftist" practices, it indeed cultivated the spirit of not being afraid of hardship among this batch of college students. Later, I was assigned to the Construction Engineering Machinery Factory as an assistant. I squatted in more than 70 of the factory's 82 workshops, participating in labor for at least a week in each workshop. In three years, I familiarized myself with the entire factory's situation and obtained the qualifications for work. We started participating in labor from the fifth grade of primary school, picking wheat stalks, delivering water, and after one year of junior high school, laboring one day a week. Many basic things were cultivated from primary and secondary schools. Now, educational work should consider from a comprehensive perspective how to make students develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and what basic work should be done.

Wang Yuying (Party Committee Secretary of Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Company Chemical Plant Three): Our undergraduate students should go straight to the grassroots for three to five years of training, otherwise, they cannot work in the department. They should also go to hard posts for one year of labor training, including high-pressure, high-temperature, flammable, explosive, and easily polluted posts. Because workers have to work here for a lifetime, you can do it for a year, right! In such a large production environment, learn the excellent qualities of the working class and the iron discipline of the proletariat. College students who have not gone through practice often have high aspirations but low abilities. When talking about the West and Freud, they are full of spirit, but their professional work is not strong. Remember that the economic benefits of a factory are not blown out, but achieved through hard work. Some college students enter the factory and start learning foreign languages and reviewing their courses, then take the graduate entrance exam and go abroad. How can the enterprise welcome them?

Zheng Huaming: Today's college graduates have strong self-confidence, but often overestimate themselves, thinking that once they arrive, the enterprise will change its face, but the reality is far from it. Some people ask for several assistants as soon as they enter the factory, but they themselves may not be qualified to be assistants. I was assigned to Beijing from Shandong 25 years ago, equally full of ambition, but when I arrived at the production line, I felt that I knew too little. True knowledge and insight need to be discovered and accumulated through long-term hard practice.

Ma Xiaogang (Manager of China Economic Information Company): I graduated from the Department of Finance at Renmin University in 1982 and was initially assigned to the Economic Development Research Center of the State Council. Many graduates of Renmin University worked in the central government departments, and we said that the "Renmin University offspring" occupied the superstructure. But later, many people withdrew and went to the grassroots. Our understanding of China's reality is not enough, and working in such a high position is not beneficial to national decision-making. College students who have just graduated from school are often a bit wild and cannot suppress their desire to show off, but because their knowledge is detached from reality, they may go astray. Soon after my graduation, I attended a meeting and gave a speech on the loan policy of the People's Bank of China, which was far from the national reality and was severely criticized in different occasions. This made me seriously summarize my experience and lessons, which was very beneficial to my later growth.

Dong Yulin (Executive Vice President of the Capital Entrepreneurs Club): We need to persuade students to go to the grassroots, where there are more opportunities for training. In the mountains, there are no tigers, and the monkeys become kings. In large organizations, sitting in the office and drafting documents may not be able to get involved, always being a small assistant.

**Understand China's National Conditions**

Zhang Junhong (Deputy General Manager of China Industrial and Commercial Economic Development Company): Since the reform and opening up, many things from the outside have come in, and young people only see the material civilization of capitalism and do not know about their backwardness. In recent years, there has been no criticism of bourgeois liberalization, and the propaganda of Marxism has been weak, causing some young people to go astray. This shows that the basic theory education of Marxism cannot be relaxed. But it must be combined with the new situation and not follow the old dogma.

Li Dalin: Many primary and secondary schools have relaxed moral education and neglected the education of communist ideals, and the admission rate has become the sole standard for measuring educational quality. Some teachers are trying to make money, and some principals are specially pulling sponsors and managing production, proposing to be a school-run enterprise tycoon and holding a school-run enterprise experience exchange meeting. I said that you can't beat me in running a business, you should do a good job as a soul engineer.

Xia Jue: You should talk to college students about some history and national conditions. Modern China has been backward for a long time, with a large population, and building modernization is not an easy task. Pay attention to exposing the evils of modern capitalist society. I have attended three annual meetings in the United States and seen their gay streets and casinos, where a large enterprise can be gambled away in an instant. What superiority does such a society have?

Zhang Junhong: Renmin University has the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity brought from Yan'an. College students should still be educated in hard work and struggle. Our country's coastal areas have developed rapidly, and many remote mountainous areas are still backward in economy and culture. Changing this situation requires many years of hard struggle.

Ma Xiaogang: When I went to the Soviet Union, I felt that they paid great attention to revolutionary tradition education. The tomb of the unknown soldier on the wall of the Kremlin was built in the 1980s, and there are many anti-fascist war memorials. Newlyweds have to queue up to visit Lenin's tomb. These are all worth our reference. Let the younger generation know that the revolutionary cause is hard-won.

Dong Yulin: Ideological and political work must be strengthened, and a good school atmosphere must be established. I do not approve of the practice of having red lights, alcohol, and dancing in schools. Some college students, after working, do not wash their clothes, do not fold their quilts, and the section chief can't stand it anymore and goes to help them fold their quilts. This way of running a school is not good.

Li Dalin: The development of enterprises relies on their own talents. The talents needed by enterprises are not the same as academic degrees. I think some doctoral students may not become the talents needed by the country.

In our factory, there are 200 college students out of 2000 people, and the ones that are relatively useful are those trained by the Radio and Television University and those who went to college from the factory and returned to the factory. These people are useful wherever they are placed. In recent years, college students who have directly come out of colleges and universities are easily influenced by bourgeois liberalization. This time, the representatives of our factory who went to the streets to demonstrate for an hour and a half were this group of college students. In 1987, I went to a certain university to give a lecture to graduate students. Their questions were interesting. What you think is not a problem, they think is very serious and needs to be clarified, and what you think is an urgent problem to be solved, they have no interest in researching. Their knowledge is seriously detached from enterprise reality and social reality.

Wang Yuying: Currently, the method of directly enrolling graduate students and doctoral students from fresh graduates is worth studying. One is to enroll more in-service doctoral students, and two is to let the directly enrolled students go to the grassroots for one to two years of training. In this way, when they enter the higher level in the future, they can also match the grassroots situation when making decisions.

Modern enterprise management needs comprehensive knowledge of multiple disciplines. Currently, the method of dividing into liberal arts and sciences in middle schools is not conducive to cultivating qualified management personnel.

Dong Yulin: Students with poor scores in mathematics, physics, and chemistry go to liberal arts, and in the future, it will be a situation where second-rate talents manage the country.

Xia Jue: Renmin University can consider absorbing a part of the cadre students as the backbone of the class.

**Seize the Opportunity to Change the Microclimate of Universities**

Huang Da (Vice President of Renmin University of China): The development of the situation has brought many new circumstances to the school's work. In recent years, the Party has implemented reform and opening up, and we have paid attention to absorbing more useful things from the outside on the original basis, which is also necessary, but later it became difficult to control. After this turmoil, bad things may turn into good things, and it may create a new beginning for adhering to the four cardinal principles and doing a good job in education under the conditions of reform and opening up.

    企业家对大学生的期待
    李梦超
    ●有的大学生进了工厂就学外语、复习功课，然后考研究生、出国，怎么让企业欢迎呢？
    ●如今的大学生自信心很强，但往往自估过高，知识与现实脱节，很可能会走弯路
    ●要说服学生到基层去，到艰苦岗位劳动锻炼，学习无产阶级铁一般的组织性
    7月12日，首都企业家俱乐部和中国人民大学联合举办学习党的十三届四中全会文件，深化教育改革座谈会。出席座谈会的企业家都是大学毕业生，他们从企业需要人才的角度，对高等学校深化教育改革发表了中肯的意见。
      坚定正确的政治方向
    袁宝华（中国人民大学校长、首都企业家俱乐部顾问）：北京的学潮从一开始就被少数阴谋分子所掌握，进而发展为动乱和反革命暴乱。像人民大学这样具有光荣革命传统、党组织比较坚强的学校，在这场风波中也出现了各式各样的问题。某些青年学生，特别是研究生，还有一些青年教师，资产阶级自由化的思想倾向相当严重。这件事很值得深思。许多尖子学生是在分数至上、智育第一的土壤上培养起来的，这在事实上偏离了党的教育方针。
    郑焕明（北京汽车工业公司总经理）：企业欢迎的大学生，首先要具有坚定正确的政治方向，解决好干什么、为谁干的问题。我们公司是中美合营企业，有的大学生来这里做翻译工作，业务熟练了，外语水平提高了，却跑到美国去了。有的人承包了项目，签订了几百万元的合同，机会一来拍拍屁股就走了，毫无责任心。今年6月我们派团赴美，请一位来厂半年的研究生随团作译员，到了那里，他留下一张便条就走了，至今没有下落。中美合资企业成为他们飞向国外的跳板。虽然他们有知识有才干，但干什么为谁干的问题并没有解决好。我们的大学毕竟是为社会主义培养人才，大学生理应为国家效力。如果照这样下去，用人民血汗培养的大学生，弄得好些的是为他人作了嫁衣裳，弄得不好是在为我们自己造就掘墓人。
    我感到，学校有责任培养学生崇高的社会责任感和强烈的事业心，如果都按个人意志进行自我塑造，中国还将是一盘散沙。
    李大林（北京建筑工程机械厂厂长）：近来和一些求职的大学生交谈，发现他们关心个人物质利益远胜过关心企业发展和国家前途。进门之后，先问企业有无中外合资经营的可能，有无出国的机会，住房多少，工资福利几何，工作是否舒适。去年，好不容易拉了一个学财会的，分到计划科，干半年就去了香港。
    夏觉（北京肯德基有限公司董事长）：有的大学毕业生掌权欲望、金钱欲望比较强，但事业心纪律性很差。我们公司是中外合营企业，职工月工资三、四百元。最近好几位学化工、农业科技的研究生要去我们那里当服务员，说是当个教授、副教授也不过如此。我不认为当服务员低下，然而国家培养你学了这么多年专业，你总该有一点事业心吧！肯德基公司信誉质量要求很严，产品超过两个小时就要倒掉，而且绝对不能分给职工。他们认为今天分掉了10只剩鸡，明天则会剩下20只。这样做可以使生产更有计划。我们两位学外语的大学生公然违犯这条禁令，把卖不出去的鸡分给职工，自己拿着炸鸡公开招摇过市，结果被开除了。
      插到基层摸爬滚打
    李大林：我大学毕业后，1968年去部队锻炼，改造旧思想。两年军旅生活，训练、掏粪、翻地，什么活都干过。尽管其中有些“左”的作法，但确实使这批大学生养成了不怕吃苦的精神。后来分到建筑工程机械厂作助手，全厂82个班组我蹲了70多个，每个班组至少参加劳动一个星期，三年之中，熟悉了全厂的情况，取得了工作的资格。我们从小学五年级就参加劳动，捡麦穗，送开水，初中一年后，每星期劳动一天。许多基础东西是从中小学就开始培养的。现在教育工作应该从总体上考虑怎么使学生德智体全面发展，应抓好哪些基础性工作。
    王玉英（北京燕山石油化工公司化工三厂党委书记）：我们的本科毕业生要一竿子扎到底，到基层锻炼三至五年，否则不能到科室工作。还应该到艰苦岗位劳动锻炼一年，甚至包括高压高温易燃易爆易受污染的岗位。因为工人要在这里干一辈子，你干一年总可以吧！在这样的大生产的环境中，学习工人阶级的优秀品质，学习无产阶级铁一般的组织纪律性。大学生不经过实践，往往眼高手低，谈起西方，谈起弗洛伊德神采飞扬，本职工作却本领不强。须知工厂的经济效益不是靠吹出来的，要靠实干。有的大学生进了厂门就学外语、复习功课，然后考研究生、出国，怎么让企业欢迎呢？
    郑焕明：如今的大学毕业生自信心很强，但往往自估过高，心想自己一到，企业就会改变面貌，其实相差很远。有的一进厂就问给他配几个助手，其实他自己当助手还不一定合格。我25年前从山东分到北京工作，同样踌躇满志，到了生产第一线，才感到学的知识太少。真知灼见需要在长期艰苦的实践中发现和积累。
    马小刚（中国经济信息公司经理）：我1982年毕业于人大财政系，起初分配到国务院经济发展研究中心工作。到中直机关工作的人民大学的毕业生很多，我们说是人大子弟占领上层建筑。但后来不少人都退出到了基层。我们对中国实际的了解还没有那么多，在那样高的地方工作，对国家决策没有好处。大学生刚出校门，往往比较狂，抑制不住表现自己的欲望，但由于知识与现实脱节，很可能会走弯路。我毕业后不久参加一次会议，就人民银行贷款政策放了一炮，因为距国家现实较远，在不同场合受到了严厉批评。这使我认真总结经验教训，对后来的成长大有好处。
    董玉麟（首都企业家俱乐部常务副主任）：要说服学生到基层去，在那里锻炼的机会多，山中无老虎，猴子称大王。在大机关，坐办公室，起草文件不一定插得上手，老是当小伙计。
      吃透中国的国情
    章君鸿（中国工商经济开发公司副总经理）：对外开放以来，外边的东西进来很多，年轻人只看到资本主义的物质文明，对他们落后的东西并不了解。这些年，对资产阶级自由化无批判的自由，对马克思主义的宣传很不力，一些年轻人因此发生了迷误。这说明马克思主义基础理论教育不能放松。但必须结合新的形势，不搞教条主义一套。
    李大林：许多中小学放松德育，忽视共产主义理想教育，升学率成为衡量教育质量的唯一标准。有些老师在设法弄钱，有些校长专门拉赞助、抓生产，提出要当什么校办企业家，开什么校办企业经验交流会。我说搞企业你干不过我，还是应当做好灵魂工程师的工作。
    夏觉：要给大学生们讲点历史，讲点国情。近代中国长期落后，人口众多，建设现代化不是轻而易举的事情。要注意揭露现代资本主义社会的弊端。我去美国开过三次年会，看到那里的什么同性恋街，什么赌场，顷刻之间偌大的企业就赌输掉了。这样的社会有什么优越性可言？
    章君鸿：人民大学有从延安带来的艰苦朴素的优良传统。对大学生仍然要进行艰苦奋斗的教育。我们国家沿海地区经济发展快，很多边远山区经济文化仍很落后，改变这种面貌要经过多年的艰苦奋斗。
    马小刚：我去苏联时，感到他们很重视革命传统教育，克里姆林宫墙的无名战士墓碑是80年代才建起来的，反法西斯战争纪念碑比比皆是，新婚夫妇拜谒列宁墓还须排队。这些都值得我们借鉴。要让青年一代知道革命江山来之不易。
    董玉麟：思想政治工作要加强，一定要建立好的校风，学校中搞灯红酒绿、轻歌曼舞这一套我不赞成。有的大学生工作之后，衣服不洗，被子不叠，处长看不下去了，去给他拆洗被褥。学校这样办不行。
    李大林：企业的发展要靠自己的人才。企业需要的人才同学位不是一回事。我看有的博士生也未必能成为国家所需要的人才。
    我们厂2000人中有200名大学生，其中比较合用的一是电大培养的，二是从工厂考入大学毕业又回到工厂的。这些人放在哪里都顶用。近几年从院校直接出来的大学生，容易接受资产阶级自由化的一套。这次代表我们厂上街游行一个半小时的就是这帮大学生。1987年我去某高校为研究生讲课。他们的提问很有意思。你认为不成问题的事情，他却认为很严重，需要搞清楚，你认为迫切需要解决的课题，他却无钻研的兴趣，他们的学问与企业实际社会实际严重脱离。
    王玉英：目前由应届毕业生直接录取硕士生博士生的办法值得研究。一是应多招在职博士生，二是直接录取的学生先去基层锻炼一至两年。这样，日后进入高层次，决策时也能与基层情况对上号。
    现代企业管理需要多学科综合性的知识，目前中学实行文理分科的办法，对培养称职的管理人才不利。
    董玉麟：数理化成绩不好的学生考文科，将来会形成二流人才管国家的局面。
    夏觉：人民大学可以再考虑吸收一部分调干生，作为班级的骨干。
  抓住转折时机改变高校的小气候
    黄达（中国人民大学副校长）：形势的发展使学校工作遇到了很多新情况。近几年来，党实行改革开放，我们在原来的基础上，注意多吸收一些外来的有用的东西，这也是必要的，但后来就很难控制了。这场风波之后，坏事有可能转变成好事，对于在改革开放条件下坚持四项基本原则办好教育，可能创造新的开端。
