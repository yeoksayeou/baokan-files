Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Song Ping, and Song Jian held a discussion today in Zhongnanhai with a group of outstanding experts from the fields of science and technology and education. Jiang Zemin emphasized in his speech that building our country and achieving the four modernizations primarily relies on our own efforts. Chinese intellectuals, especially those in the natural sciences, must strive for excellence.

During the discussion, the experts reviewed China's achievements in various scientific and technological fields, such as corn breeding, hybrid rice, high-temperature superconductivity, and non-ferrous metals. They said that only by organizing collective efforts, working hard, and adhering to the spirit of collectivism, and by investing limited funds in key research projects, can scientific research achieve real results. They reflected that one of the most important lessons from the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion is the need to strengthen ideological education for youth. Over the years, political and ideological education has been relaxed, and the previously advocated collectivist and communist ideals have been diluted to varying degrees. Some people emphasize only bonuses and personal value, and some even promote Western capitalist ideas. This trend is very dangerous. Additionally, they offered suggestions regarding the working conditions, living standards, and research funding for scientific and technological personnel.

Jiang Zemin made an important speech during the discussion. He said that to enhance China's strength, we must first develop our economy. Modernization cannot be achieved without the development and support of science and technology. Scientific and technological work is extremely important. We have a strong scientific and technological force, a good research team, and national-level research institutions, as well as research teams in various ministries, provinces, municipalities, institutions of higher learning, and large enterprises. As long as we organize them well, they can make greater contributions to economic development.

He emphasized that science and technology must serve modernization, combining theory with practice, and balancing the relationship between basic scientific research, applied scientific research, and development research. In the field of science, basic science should occupy a certain position. If we only focus on development and applied research, neglecting basic science, we will lack the foundation. We emphasize the importance of basic research, but we should not engage in projects that are detached from reality and purely academic. The ultimate goal is still to serve modernization. In the field of scientific research, basic research, applied research, and technological development should maintain a certain proportion and develop in coordination.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the majority of intellectuals, especially those who have been tempered by practice and insist on working on the front lines of scientific research and production, have performed well. Intellectuals are part of the working class and must fully play their role. To develop China's economy, we must rely on science and technology and our own efforts, adhering to the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. Chinese intellectuals, especially those in the natural sciences, must strive for excellence.

Li Peng also spoke. He said that from this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, it can be proven that the vast majority of China's scientific and technological personnel have performed well. They support the socialist system and the leadership of the Party and are a reliable force for the Party and the people. When talking about the importance of science and technology, he said that our goal is to achieve the four modernizations. In the four modernizations, scientific and technological modernization is the key, and industrial, agricultural, and national defense modernization all need to be armed with modern science and technology. When we talk about playing the leading role of the working class, this does not in any way reduce the role of intellectuals. Because intellectuals are mental laborers and are themselves part of the working class, and they will play an important role in achieving the four modernizations.

Li Peng said that over the past 40 years, China has established a large number of national and ministerial-level research institutions, with a large number of professional talents and research equipment, and has accumulated rich experience. This is the main force on the scientific research front and must be valued and continue to play its role. Many large and medium-sized enterprises have their own research institutions, which maintain a close connection with production practice and play an irreplaceable role in the technological development and transformation of enterprises, and in converting scientific research achievements into productive forces. Modern science and technology is a large-scale system project. The realization of many important projects requires not only the full play of the role of outstanding experts and discipline leaders but also the collective force.

He said that looking back at the series of major scientific research achievements China has made, they are all achieved mainly through self-reliance while also learning from advanced foreign technologies. The policy of reform and opening up has had a huge impact on the prosperity of science and technology in China. We will not only not change this policy but will also implement it better and more perfectly. Now, some Western countries want to close the door that China has already opened, which will not succeed. This is not only detrimental to China but also to Western countries. Now, many enlightened people in the West have seen that this is unwise and are gradually lifting economic sanctions against China. We welcome this. Chinese scientists will, as always, actively participate in international scientific and technological exchanges and are willing to make their due contributions.

Li Peng also expressed his sincere hopes for China's scientific and technological personnel, hoping that they will love socialist China, love the Communist Party of China, love the people, and also love their own cause. The older generation of scientific and technological experts, from the contrast between the old and new societies, have deep feelings for the Party and the motherland; the middle-aged scientific and technological experts have mostly established a correct outlook on life, are politically mature, and are the backbone of the current scientific and technological front; young scientific and technological workers are the future of the motherland, with heavy responsibilities and a long way to go. He hopes that young scientific and technological workers will learn from middle-aged and elderly scientific and technological experts and workers, strive to combine theory with practice, and train themselves to become politically firm and truly talented successors.

The experts who participated in the meeting included Li Jingxiong, Yuan Longping, Shi Yuanchun, Yu Min, Liang Shupan, Pan Jiazhen, Wang Zhiyu, Liu Jian, Wang Dezhong, Xu Fulian, Liu Jianhang, Chen Hongzhang, Li Zhensheng, Wang Zhenxi, Fu Jiamo, Li Jiaming, Tang Aoqing, Lu Dongxiang, Wang Shiguang, Zhu Yu, and Hu Yamei.

Song Ping and Song Jian also spoke at the meeting. Those who participated in the meeting also included relevant responsible persons Zhao Dongwan and Jiang Guanhuang.

    江泽民李鹏等同有突出贡献的专家座谈时强调
    实现四化主要靠自己力量
    中国的知识分子要争这口气
    新华社北京8月28日电  党中央、国务院领导同志江泽民、李鹏、宋平、宋健今天在中南海同来自科技和教育战线上的有突出贡献的部分专家进行座谈。江泽民在讲话中强调，建设我们的祖国，实现四个现代化，主要靠我们自己的力量，中国的知识分子要争这口气，工作在自然科学领域的知识分子更要争这口气。
    专家在座谈中，回顾了我国在玉米育种、水稻杂交、高温超导、有色金属等各个科技领域所取得的成绩。他们说，只有组织起来，艰苦奋斗，发扬集体主义精神，把有限的资金投入到重点科研项目上去，才能取得科研实效。他们说，对这次动乱和反革命暴乱，最值得反思的，就是要加强对青年的思想教育工作。这些年来，由于政治思想教育工作放松了，过去所提倡的集体主义思想、共产主义思想都不同程度地被淡化了。一些人只强调奖金、个人价值，有的甚至搞西方资本主义那一套，这样下去是很危险的。此外，他们还就科技人员的工作条件，生活待遇和科研投入等提出了建议。
    江泽民在座谈中作了重要讲话。他说，要增强我国的实力，首先要把经济搞上去，实现现代化离不开科学技术的发展和支持，科技工作非常重要。我们的科技力量是很强的，有一支很好的科研队伍，有全国性的科研机构，也有各部委各省市以及高等院校、大型企业的科研队伍，只要很好组织起来，就能为经济发展做出更大的贡献。
    他强调，科学技术要为现代化服务，要理论联系实际，要处理好基础科学研究、应用科学研究和开发研究的关系。在科学事业中，基础科学应占一定的位置。如果只注重开发和应用研究，基础科学跟不上，就没有了后劲。我们强调基础研究的重要性，但不能搞那种脱离实际、学院式的项目，它的目标从长远来说还是为现代化服务。在科学研究领域，基础研究、应用研究、技术开发，三者要有一定的比例关系，协调发展。
    江泽民同志指出，在这次平息反革命暴乱中，知识分子绝大多数，特别是经过实践锻炼、坚持在科研和生产第一线的科技人员表现是好的。知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，必须充分发挥他们的作用。为了把我国经济建设搞上去，要靠科学技术，要靠我们自己的力量，坚持自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神。中国知识分子特别是从事自然科学的知识分子要争这口气。
    李鹏也讲了话。他说，从这次动乱和反革命暴乱中，可以证明中国广大科学技术人员的绝大多数表现是好的。他们拥护社会主义制度，拥护党的领导，是党和人民完全可以信赖的一支好队伍。他在谈到科学技术的重要性时说，我们的奋斗目标是实现四个现代化。在四化中，科技现代化是关键，工业、农业和国防现代化都需要用现代的科学技术来武装。我们讲发挥工人阶级主力军的作用，这丝毫也不能降低知识分子的作用。因为知识分子是脑力劳动者，本身就是工人阶级的组成部分，并在实现四化中要发挥重要作用。
    李鹏说，40年来我国已经建立了一大批国家级和部委级的科研机构，拥有一大批专门人才和科研设备，积累了丰富的经验，这是科研战线上的主力，必须重视和继续发挥它们的作用。许多大中型企业都有自己的科研机构，它们与生产实际保持密切联系，对企业的技术开发与改造，把科研成果转化为生产力，有着不可忽视的作用。现代科学技术是一个庞大的系统工程，许多重要项目的实现，既要充分重视卓越的专家和学科带头人的作用，也必须依靠集体的力量。
    他说，回顾一下我国所取得的一系列重大科研成果，都是靠自力更生为主，同时又吸取国外先进的技术而取得的。改革开放政策对我国科技繁荣已经产生巨大的作用，我们不但不会改变这一政策，而且应把这一政策执行得更好，更完善。现在某些西方国家，想把中国已经开放的大门封闭起来，这是不能成功的。这不仅对中国不利，对西方国家也不利。现在西方许多有识之士已看到这是不明智的，正在逐步解除对中国的经济制裁，对此我们表示欢迎。中国科技界人士将一如既往地积极参加国际科技交流活动，愿为此作出自己应有的贡献。
    李鹏还对中国广大科技人员提出殷切的希望，希望他们热爱社会主义的祖国，热爱中国共产党，热爱人民，同时也热爱自己的事业。老一辈科技专家，从新旧社会对比中，对党对祖国怀有深厚的感情；中年科技专家大都树立了正确的人生观，政治上比较成熟，是当前科技战线上的骨干；青年科技工作者，是祖国的未来，任重而道远。他希望青年科技工作者要向中、老年科技专家学习，向工人学习，努力与实践相结合，把自己锻炼成为政治上坚定，又有真才实学的接班人。
    参加会见的专家有李竞雄、袁隆平、石元春、于敏、梁守槃、潘家铮、王志武、刘玠、王德雍、许富良、刘建航、陈鸿章、李振声、王震西、傅家谟、李家明、唐敖庆、路甬祥、王世光、朱预、胡亚美。
    宋平、宋健也在座谈会上讲了话。参加会见的还有有关方面负责人赵东宛、蒋冠庄。
