Behind the Hostage Crisis

By Lin Jiaoming, Correspondent

Israeli commandos raided Lebanon last month on the 28th to kidnap Hezbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi. Subsequently, Hezbollah hanged American hostage Allyn R. Lynch, causing a "hostage crisis" in the Middle East.

Surrounding the authenticity, timing, and fate of the remaining Western hostages, the Western media has conducted extensive reporting. Meanwhile, as the crisis evolved from Israeli-Lebanese relations to U.S.-Iranian relations, and from a simple hostage issue to other political and economic relations, some Western opinions have intentionally or unintentionally overlooked the factors hidden behind this crisis.

No one can deny that, although the Middle East hostage problem has a 40-year complex background of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the current crisis was initially instigated by Israel.

Among the numerous reports on the "hostage crisis," there are two "less noticeable facts" that can help people see through the surface of the crisis and understand the goals of the Israeli authorities.

First, the Israeli government revealed after the "hostage crisis" broke out that the operation to kidnap Musawi was secretly approved by the "small cabinet" within the Israeli cabinet three months prior and was executed by the military. Three months ago, the Arab camp was in the midst of a successful peace offensive, international opinion was turning towards the PLO's serious negotiating stance, and even some American opinions criticized Israel's inflexible position. Israel was more isolated than ever.

Second, although Israel proposed to exchange Musawi and others for three Israeli soldiers and hostages from the U.S., Britain, and other countries in Lebanon after the kidnapping, Rabin, the Minister of Defense, still cannot confirm whether the three Israeli hostages are still alive. This cannot help but make one suspect the true intentions behind Israel's risky kidnapping of Musawi, especially since Israel's terrorist actions have resulted in harm to American hostages, leading to Lynch's execution.

It is not difficult to see that Israel's timing in taking terrorist kidnapping actions aims to: stir up the Middle East situation, escalate tensions between the United States and other Western countries with Middle Eastern countries, and utilize the widespread concern in Western public opinion over the fate of the hostages to disrupt the Middle East peace process, which has already put immense pressure on Israel. This is an attempt to shift the focus from criticism of Shamir's election plan and to escape internal and external difficulties.

Currently, the work of the Arab League's three-nation committee to mediate the Lebanese crisis has been disrupted by the "hostage crisis" and has announced that it is at a stalemate. The U.S. government, entangled in the "hostage crisis," obviously has no time to consider solving the Middle East problem. People believe that negotiations filled with thorns and lasting for a long time will soon unfold around the hostage issue.

What is particularly worth noting is that Israel's tactics of creating chaos in the Middle East and muddying the waters are becoming increasingly intense. According to Western news agencies, Israel is accelerating the training of special forces, ready to launch terrorist attacks on the PLO and neighboring countries at any time. Israel seems to hope that the tense "psychological warfare" will tightly bind the hands of the Bush administration, temporarily easing the difficulties, but whether this will ultimately be effective remains to be seen.

### 人质危机背后

    人质危机背后
    本报记者　林皎明
    以色列突击队上月28日突袭黎巴嫩，绑架真主党领导人奥贝德，随后，真主党绞死美国人质希金斯，中东因而产生了一场“人质危机”。
    围绕着美国中校希金斯被处绞刑的真伪、时间以及其余西方被扣人质的命运，西方新闻界作了大量报道。同时，由于危机的演变逐渐由以黎关系扩展到美伊关系，由单纯人质问题牵涉到其它政治经济关系，西方某些舆论有意无意地忽略了隐藏在这场危机背后的因素。
    谁都无法否认，尽管中东人质问题有绵延40年的阿以争端复杂背景，但目前这场危机最先是以色列挑起的。
    在纷繁的“人质危机”报道中，有两件“不太起眼的事实”可以帮助人们透过危机的表面，看穿以色列当局企图借此达到的目的。
    其一，以色列政府在“人质危机”爆发后泄露，绑架奥贝德的行动早在3个月前由以色列内阁中的“小内阁”秘密批准，交军方执行。3个月前，中东正值阿拉伯阵营的和平攻势节节胜利，世界舆论倒向巴解组织的严肃和谈立场，连美国一些舆论也批评以色列的顽固立场。以色列空前孤立。
    其二，尽管以色列绑架行动之后提出要用奥贝德等人换回以色列3名士兵和美英等国在黎巴嫩的人质，然而，拉宾国防部长至今都无法确认以色列3名人质是否还活着。这就不能不使人怀疑，以色列冒险绑架奥贝德的真实用意所在，更何况以色列恐怖行为的结果，祸及美国人质，导致希金斯被处死。
    不难看出，以色列选在目前时机采取恐怖绑架行动的图谋是：搅混中东局势，激化美国等西方国家与中东国家的紧张关系，并利用西方国家舆论普遍担心人质命运的情绪，冲击业已对以色列造成巨大压力的中东和平进程，转移舆论对沙米尔选举计划的批评，以此摆脱内外困境。
    目前，阿盟调解黎巴嫩危机3国委员会的工作，受到“人质危机”的干扰，已宣布陷入僵局。美国政府为“人质危机”所困，显然顾不上考虑解决中东问题。人们认为，围绕人质问题行将展开一场充满荆棘的旷日持久的谈判。
    值得特别警惕的是，以色列在中东制造混乱、混水摸鱼的伎俩有越演越烈的趋势。据西方通讯社透露，以色列正在加紧培训特种部队，随时准备对巴解组织和周边国家采取恐怖袭击。以色列看来寄希望于紧张的“神经战”，死死捆住美国布什政府的手脚，暂渡难关，但最终能否奏效，就很难说了。（本报开罗8月10日电）
