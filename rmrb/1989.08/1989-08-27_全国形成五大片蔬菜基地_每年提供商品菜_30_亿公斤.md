After just five years of reform in the vegetable production and sales system, five major nationwide vegetable production bases have taken shape in China's tropical, subtropical, temperate regions, and some special climate zones. These bases can provide approximately 3 billion kilograms of commercial vegetables annually. This is the reason why many large and medium-sized cities in China do not experience vegetable shortages in the off-season, and residents can enjoy fresh vegetables all year round.

The five major nationwide vegetable production bases are:

1. The South-to-North Vegetable Transportation Base, primarily in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Fujian provinces, which mainly supplies vegetables to large and medium-sized cities in northern China from late November to the following April.
2. The Spring Vegetable Production Base in the Huaihai Economic Zone, primarily in Xuzhou, Bengbu, and eight counties, which mainly supplements the spring vegetable market in large and medium-sized cities from February to May.
3. The Autumn Vegetable Production Base in the Zhangjiakou Economic Zone, primarily in six counties, which mainly supplements the autumn vegetable market in large and medium-sized cities like Beijing and Tianjin in August and September.
4. The Autumn Vegetable Production Base in the Hexi Corridor, primarily in Zhangye, Jiayuguan, and Wuwei, which mainly supplements the autumn vegetable market in large and medium-sized cities in North China and Northeast China in August and September.
5. The Autumn and Winter Cabbage Production Base in Tangshan, Hebei, and Shandong, which supplements the autumn and winter vegetable market in large and medium-sized cities in northern China.

Currently, the circulation facilities in these five vegetable production bases are not yet perfect. To address this, the Ministry of Commerce has proposed a construction plan to solve some urgent needs in these bases, such as railway dedicated lines, platforms, turnover warehouses, ice factories, procurement sites, and wholesale markets. Once these construction projects are completed, it is estimated that annual vegetable losses valued at tens of millions of yuan can be reduced.

    全国形成五大片蔬菜基地
    每年提供商品菜30亿公斤
    据新华社北京8月27日电　（记者陈芸）经过短短五年蔬菜产销体制改革，在我国热带、亚热带、温带以及部分小气候区域，初步形成了五大片全国性蔬菜商品基地，每年可提供商品菜30亿公斤左右。这就是全国许多大中城市蔬菜淡季不淡，市民四季都能吃到较多新鲜菜的原因。
    这五大片全国性蔬菜商品基地是：以广东、广西、云南、四川、福建五省区为主的南菜北运基地，主要丰富北方大中城市11月下旬至翌年4月冬季蔬菜市场供应；以徐州、蚌埠市及八个县为主的淮海经济区春淡蔬菜生产基地，主要补充大中城市2至5月的春淡蔬菜市场供应；以张家口经济区六县为主的秋淡蔬菜生产基地，主要补充京、津等大中城市8、9月份秋淡蔬菜市场供应；以张掖、酒泉、武威为主的河西走廊秋淡蔬菜生产基地，主要补充华北、东北地区的大中城市8、9月秋淡蔬菜市场供应；以河北唐山和山东为主的秋季大白菜生产基地，补充北方大中城市秋冬蔬菜市场供应。据了解，现在五大蔬菜基地的流通设施还不够完善，为此商业部已提出一个建设规划，准备分两批解决一些基地急需的铁路专用线、站台、周转库、制冰厂以及收购场所和批发交易市场。待这些建设项目完成后，每年可减少价值千万元的蔬菜损失。
