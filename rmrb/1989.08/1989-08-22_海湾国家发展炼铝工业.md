With the continuous growth in international demand for aluminum, the Gulf states have fully utilized the abundant energy resources and substantial funds in their region to vigorously develop the aluminum industry, making aluminum production a major industry in the region, second only to oil production.

In recent years, the aluminum industry in Japan, the United States, and other countries has shown signs of decline, providing a good opportunity for the Gulf region to develop its aluminum industry. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, with their substantial funds, have imported bauxite from Australia and utilized their own low-cost energy to vigorously develop the aluminum industry.

The "Alba" company in Bahrain is the largest aluminum producer in the Gulf, and it is also the largest enterprise in the Gulf states outside of the oil industry. The company is currently undergoing expansion, and its scale will exceed that of large aluminum plants in the West. The company's development plan is noteworthy: the first step is to increase annual production from 170,000 tons to 225,000 tons, and the second step is to reach 360,000 tons by 1992.

The Dubai Aluminum Company in the United Arab Emirates is second only to the "Alba" company in scale, and by 1991, its annual production will reach 230,000 tons.

Currently, the production cost of aluminum on the world market is $1,600 to $1,700 per ton. However, in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the production cost is only $1,100 to $1,200 per ton. This favorable situation will further stimulate the development of the aluminum industry in the Gulf states.

    海湾国家发展炼铝工业
    随着国际市场对铝的需求不断增长，海湾国家充分利用本地区的丰富能源和雄厚资金，大力发展炼铝工业，使铝的生产成为该地区仅次于石油生产的一项重要工业。
    近年来，日本、美国等地炼铝业呈现萎缩趋势，这为海湾地区发展炼铝工业带来了极好的机会。沙特、巴林、阿联酋和卡塔尔4个海湾国家依靠雄厚的资金从澳大利亚进口铝土矿，同时利用本国价格低廉的能源，大力发展炼铝工业。
    巴林的“阿勒巴”公司是海湾最大的炼铝厂家，它也是海湾国家除石油工业外的最大企业。这个公司目前还在进行扩建，其规模将超过西方的大型炼铝厂。该公司的发展计划令人注目，第一步是将年产量由17万吨提高到22.5万吨，第二步是到1992年年产量达36万吨。
    阿联酋的迪拜炼铝公司的规模仅次于“阿勒巴”公司，到1991年该公司的年产量将达到23万吨。
    目前，世界市场每吨铝的生产成本为1600—1700美元，而在巴林和阿联酋，每吨铝的生产成本仅为1100—1200美元，这一有利的形势将进一步刺激海湾国家炼铝工业的发展。
