	Brave Fight Against Criminals, Sacrificing for the People
	Yang Guangbin Awarded the Title of National Public Security First-Class Hero Model

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 4 (Reporter Wu Hengquan) Recently, the Ministry of Public Security issued an order, posthumously awarding the title of National Public Security First-Class Hero Model to Yang Guangbin, a police officer who bravely fought against criminals and sacrificed his life.

	Yang Guangbin was a police officer from the Qinghekou Substation of the Fan Dong District Public Security Bureau in Xiangfan City, Hubei Province. On the evening of June 9 this year, Yang Guangbin led three police officers and neighborhood watch members to the residence of Li Xingzhang, a suspect in a gun theft, armed robbery, and murder case, to apprehend him. Suddenly, Li Xingzhang picked up a submachine gun and resisted. In this dangerous moment, Yang Guangbin bravely and wisely engaged with the criminal and directed two other police officers to flank the suspect and disperse the crowd. Li Xingzhang frantically opened fire. Yang Guangbin bravely returned fire, hitting Li in the chest and abdomen, but he himself was hit by five bullets. Li Xingzhang rushed out of the room, attempting to shoot the crowd. Yang Guangbin fired, hitting Li in the head, and Li was killed on the spot. Yang Guangbin also died from excessive blood loss.

    勇斗凶犯　为民捐躯
    杨光斌被授一级英模称号
    本报讯　记者吴恒权报道：日前，公安部发布命令，追授勇斗罪犯、壮烈牺牲的民警杨光斌同志全国公安战线一级英雄模范称号。
    杨光斌是湖北省襄樊市公安局樊东分局清河口派出所民警。今年6月9日晚，杨光斌带领三名干警和联防队员前往盗枪、持枪抢劫杀人案犯李兴章住处查捕时，李犯突然端起冲锋枪顽抗。在危险时刻，杨光斌同志机智勇敢地与罪犯周旋，并指挥另两位民警分别包抄案犯和疏散群众。案犯李兴章疯狂地开枪扫射，杨光斌英勇还击，击中李犯胸部、腹部，自己也身中5弹。李犯冲出房门，企图对群众扫射。杨光斌开枪击中李犯头部，李犯当场毙命。杨光斌同志也因流血过多，壮烈牺牲。
