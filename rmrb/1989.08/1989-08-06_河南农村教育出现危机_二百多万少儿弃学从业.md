Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 6th — (Reporter: Lù Yǒngjiàn) Approximately 2.5 million rural minors in Henan Province have dropped out of school to work.

The Henan Provincial Rural Social and Economic Survey Team recently conducted a sample survey of 5,278 rural minors across the province. The survey revealed that among rural minors aged 6 to 17, nearly 14 percent have abandoned their schooling to engage in labor. The survey indicates that the majority of these dropouts have become child farmers, working in the fields. Some have joined village construction teams or entered factories and workshops in township enterprises, becoming de facto "child laborers." Others are seen hawking goods in shops, restaurants, and on the streets.

    河南农村教育出现危机  二百多万少儿弃学从业
    据新华社郑州八月六日电　（记者鹿永建）河南省约有二百五十万农村少年儿童弃学从业。
    河南省农村社会经济调查队最近对全省五千二百七十八名农村少年儿童进行抽样调查，发现六至十七岁农村少年儿童中，有近百分之十四的人放弃上学读书的宝贵时期，过早投入生产劳动。调查表明，这些弃学从业的少年儿童，他们中绝大多数走向田间，成为少年农民，有一些加入乡村建筑队或跨入乡镇企业的工厂、车间，成为事实上的“童工”，还有的叫卖于商店、饭馆、街头。
