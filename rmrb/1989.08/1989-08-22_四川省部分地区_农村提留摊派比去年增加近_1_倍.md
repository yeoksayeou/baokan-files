According to a recent survey by the rural socio-economic investigation teams of Mianyang City's central district and the counties of Renhou, Fengdu, Jiangjin, Weiyuan, Nanbu, Yilong, and Hejiang in Sichuan Province, the amount of levies and assessments (excluding collective production costs) in rural areas has surged, with farmers' burdens nearly doubling compared to 1988.

The number of levy and assessment items has increased significantly. The survey shows that this year, the number of levy and assessment items generally increased by 5-7, which is about 2/5 more than last year. Newly added levy items mainly include: child health care fees, only-child fees, mulberry tree fees, forest protection fees, public security fees, militia training fees, village enterprise fees, labor service fees, village and group newspaper subscription fees, and agricultural contract fees. Some places have also increased the amount of levies. The situation in Mianyang City's central district and the counties of Fengdu and Jiangjin indicates that this year, various levies and assessments have increased by approximately 5-10 yuan, growing by more than 40%, with some exceeding 100%. In Mianyang City's central district, the per capita burden on farmers has increased from 26.30 yuan last year to over 50 yuan this year, nearly doubling in one year.

Education fundraising and agricultural taxes have seen rapid growth. The main reason for the increase in farmers' burdens this year is the significant rise in education fundraising and agricultural taxes. For example, in Bailin Township, Mianyang City's central district, the per capita education fundraising fee is 23 yuan, an increase of 2.7 times compared to last year. In Fushapo Village, Dawan Village Group, Rensha Township, Fengdu County, the per capita amount is 4 yuan, an increase of 1.7 times compared to last year. Looking at specific items, the levies for education have almost all increased significantly. In the context of decreasing arable land in rural areas and the recent downturn in crop farming, agricultural taxes have been increasing year by year. For instance, the per capita agricultural tax in Mianyang City's central district and Jiangjin County is nearly 10 yuan, an increase of about 20% compared to last year.

There is a lot of grumbling about levies and assessments that are collected without corresponding services. Farmers in Renhou County have pointed out that they pay a subsidy for fruit technology personnel, but have never seen any fruit technology personnel come to the countryside for guidance; they pay a few jiao per person per year for movie fees, but cannot watch movies. Farmers in Rensha Township, Fengdu County, say that the mulberry tree fund and forestry fund are allocated per person, which is very unreasonable. Many places have reported that after paying education fundraising fees, schools have not changed much, tuition fees continue to rise, and rural children can hardly afford to go to school. According to a survey of 120 households by the agricultural investigation team in Nanbu County this year, 61% of households are dissatisfied with the arbitrary levies and assessments.

The reason why farmers' burdens have increased this year is multifaceted: first, some national taxes have increased (such as additional education fees and increased agricultural and forestry special product taxes); second, some grassroots cadres mistakenly believe that the country is focusing on agriculture this year, and farmers' lives have improved, thus leading to the idea of taking more from farmers; third, the phenomenon of arbitrary levies and assessments is prominent; fourth, some places are eager to achieve results quickly, wanting to raise more money and do more for farmers in the atmosphere of focusing on agriculture; fifth, the standards for cadre work compensation, etc., have been raised.

### 四川省部分地区——农村提留摊派比去年增加近1倍

    四川省部分地区——
    农村提留摊派比去年增加近1倍
    据四川省绵阳市中区及仁寿、丰都、江津、威远、南部、仪陇、合江等县农村社会经济调查队最近调查：农村的提留摊派（不含共同生产费，下同）数量猛增，农民负担比1988年增加近1倍。
    摊派项目繁多，数额剧增。从调查看，今年提留摊派项目一般增加5—7项，比去年增加2／5左右。新增提留项目主要有：儿童保健费、独生子女费、桑树费、护林费、公安费、民兵训练费、村企业费、义务工费、村组订报费、农业承包合同费等，一些地方还增加了提留数额。绵阳市中区和丰都、江津等县的情况表明，今年各种提留摊派增加额约为5—10元，增长40％以上，多的超过1倍。绵阳市中区农民人均负担由去年的26.30元增加到今年的50余元，一年增加近1倍。
    教育集资和农业税增长快。今年农民负担增加的主要原因是教育集资费和农业税大幅度增加。如绵阳市中区柏林乡，今年教育集资费人均23元，比去年增加2.7倍。丰都县仁沙乡傅家坡村大湾口组人均4元，较去年增加1.7倍。从具体项目看，用于教育的提留几乎是每项都有较多增加。在农村耕地逐年减少，近几年种植业又不景气的情况下，农业税却逐年增加。如绵阳市中区和江津县的农业税人均近10元，比去年增加20％左右。
    只提留不办事，农民意见很大。仁寿县农民反映，交了水果技术人员补贴费，但从未见水果技术人员下乡指导；每人每年交几角钱的电影费，却看不上电影。丰都县仁沙乡农民说，桑树款、林业款按人分摊，很不合理。不少地方反映，交了教育集资费，学校变化不大，学杂费照涨不误，农家子弟反而读不起书。据南部县农调队今年对120个农户的问卷调查，61％的农户对乱摊派和乱提留表示不满。
    今年各地农民的负担之所以加重，一是国家某些税收增加（如增收教育附加费、增收农林特产税等）；二是不少基层干部错误地认为今年国家重视农业了，农民的日子又好过了，因而产生从农民手里多拿一点的思想；三是乱摊滥提现象突出；四是一些地方急于求成，想在大抓农业的气候下多提点钱，多为农民办些实事；五是提高了干部误工补贴等的标准。
