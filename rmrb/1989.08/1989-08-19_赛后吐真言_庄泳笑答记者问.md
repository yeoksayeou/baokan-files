“After the competition, I don’t like the silver medal from the Olympics, and I don’t like the gold medal I won today. What I like is breaking world records and becoming the world champion.” This was what Zhang Yong said on the evening of August 18th after winning the women’s 100-meter freestyle championship at the third Pan-Pacific Swimming Championships.

After the women’s 100-meter freestyle final, the gold medal winner Zhang Yong became the focus of the journalists’ interviews. More than 20 journalists from various countries, along with the reporter and translator, gathered to interview her. The first question from the journalists was, “You won a silver medal in the Seoul Olympics last year, and now you have won a gold medal. Which do you prefer?” Zhang Yong smiled slightly, shook her still-wet hair, and softly said, “I don’t like either.” The journalists were taken aback and confused, quickly asking why. Zhang Yong raised her head and firmly replied, “What I like is breaking world records and becoming the world champion.” At this moment, the journalists’ confused expressions turned into respectful and understanding smiles. Zhang Yong also smiled, but her smile was serious and determined.

In the morning, Zhang Yong swam 55.38 seconds in the women’s 100-meter freestyle preliminary round, breaking the championship record and her own Asian record of 55.47 seconds. Although she won the championship in the afternoon final, her time was 55.68 seconds, which was slower than her preliminary round time. A journalist asked about the reason, and Zhang Yong explained that since the Seoul Olympics last year, she had been adjusting her physical condition and only started regular training at the end of May this year. She had not yet reached her peak condition, and with the multiple events in the past two days, it was difficult to maintain the best condition throughout the day.

A Japanese journalist asked, “What is your next goal? Is it the 1991 World Championships in Australia or the Barcelona Olympics?” Zhang Yong shook her head and said, “Neither.” She said, “My next goal is the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. I want to bring glory to my motherland and the Beijing Asian Games.”

    赛后吐真言
    ——庄泳笑答记者问
    “我不喜欢奥运会的银牌，也不喜欢今天夺得的金牌，我喜欢的是破世界纪录，当世界冠军。”这是庄泳18日晚在获得第三届泛太平洋地区游泳锦标赛女子100米自由泳冠军后说的。
    女子100米自由泳决赛结束后，金牌获得者庄泳成为记者的采访对象。20多名各国记者叫笔者兼翻译一起采访她。记者首先问她：“你去年在汉城奥运会上获得银牌，这次获得金牌，这两者你喜欢哪一个？”庄泳微微一笑，甩了甩还湿的头发轻声说：“我都不喜欢。”众记者闻听此言后均是一愣，感到迷惑不解，赶忙追问为什么。庄泳扬扬头，一字一句有力地回答：“我喜欢的是破世界纪录，当世界冠军。”这时众记者迷惑不解的表情变成了敬佩而会意的笑容。庄泳也笑了，然而她的笑容中带有严肃认真的成份。
    庄泳上午在女子100米自由泳预赛中，游出了55秒38的好成绩，打破了锦标赛纪录和自己保持的55秒47的亚洲纪录。她在下午的决赛中虽然获得冠军，但成绩是55秒68，低于预赛成绩。有记者问其原因，庄泳告诉大家，去年汉城奥运会后，一直进行身体调整训练，从今年5月底才开始进行正规训练，还没有达到最佳状态，加之这两天比赛项目较多，很难一整天都处于最佳状态。
    日本记者问，你的下一个目标是什么？是1991年在澳大利亚举行的世界锦标赛，还是巴塞罗那奥运会？庄泳摇摇头说，都不是。她说：“我的下一个目标是北京1990年亚运会，我要为我的祖国和北京亚运会增辉。”
