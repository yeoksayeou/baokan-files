Some regions are experiencing severe drought, threatening the growth of autumn grains and cotton. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun demands the adoption of all effective measures to combat drought and achieve a bumper harvest.

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 19th - (Reporter Ma Chengguang) At today's meeting convened by the State Flood Control Headquarters to deploy anti-drought work, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun emphasized that regions still affected by continuous drought must mobilize urgently and adopt all effective measures to combat drought and achieve a bumper harvest.

Tian Jiyun said that since late July, although there has been no large-scale, continuous drought nationwide, some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have had virtually no rain, and the drought situation is severe. This period is a critical time for the growth of autumn crops, and coupled with insufficient moisture from previous rains and the occurrence of "neck-drought," the threat to autumn grain and cotton production is significant.

He said that achieving a bumper autumn harvest is crucial for realizing the goal of a full-year agricultural bumper harvest, implementing the rectification and adjustment policies, overcoming the difficulties we face, and promoting the development of the entire economy and social stability.

All drought-affected areas must mobilize urgently, take effective measures to combat drought, and strive to minimize the losses caused by drought, aiming to achieve a bumper autumn harvest.

Tian Jiyun said that to tackle the current anti-drought work, the first step is to address the issue of awareness. We must not harbor any illusions and wait for rain. Time is of the essence in agriculture, and we must act immediately, focusing on combating drought and achieving a bumper harvest. Second, the main leaders of local governments at all levels must personally lead the anti-drought efforts, balancing both flood control and drought relief. Regardless of the situation, leaders at all levels must take action against drought. Third, we must adopt effective, cost-efficient, and high-yield anti-drought measures. Fully utilize existing water resources, promote more irrigation; where shallow wells can be dug, dig some shallow wells for quick results; take various measures to conserve water and strengthen field management to retain moisture. Fourth, all sectors and departments must strongly support anti-drought efforts. Currently, combating drought and achieving a bumper harvest is a major task, and all sectors must contribute to this goal. Funds and materials needed for anti-drought efforts must be ensured for timely allocation and cannot be delayed. Fifth, we must seize the opportunity to continue large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction. Starting early on agricultural water conservancy construction will gain the initiative and achieve better results.

Tian Jiyun also demanded that areas with the possibility of heavy rain and coastal regions must effectively carry out flood control and typhoon prevention work.

At the meeting, Minister of Water Resources Yang Zhenhuai reported on the drought situation in relevant regions and the measures to be taken for effective anti-drought efforts.

    一些地区旱情严重  威胁秋粮棉花生长
    田纪云要求采取一切有效措施抗旱夺丰收
    新华社北京8月19日电（记者马成广）国务院副总理田纪云在今天召开的国家防汛总指挥部部署抗旱工作会议上强调说，目前还持续受干旱威胁的地区，要紧急动员起来，采取一切行之有效的措施，抗旱夺丰收。
    田纪云说，7月下旬以来，从全国来讲，虽没有出现大范围的持续干旱，但有些省、自治区、直辖市的一些地区基本无雨，旱情较严重。这阶段正值秋季作物生长的关键时期，加上前期底墒不足，又遇“卡脖旱”，对秋粮、棉花等生产威胁较大。
    他说，夺取秋季农业丰收，对实现全年农业丰收的目标，对贯彻治理整顿方针和克服我们面临的某些困难，对促进整个经济的发展和社会的安定，关系重大。一切遭受干旱的地方要紧急动员起来，采取有力措施抗旱，千方百计把干旱造成的损失减少到最低程度，力争夺取秋季农业丰收。
    田纪云说，抓好当前抗旱工作，首先要解决认识问题。不能存有侥幸思想，坐等下雨。农时不等人，要立即行动，立足于抗旱夺丰收。二、地方各级政府主要领导要亲自抗旱，要两手抓，既抓防汛，又抓抗旱。不论哪种情况，都必须由各级领导亲自抓，在干旱面前要有所作为。三、要采取行之有效、费省效宏的抗旱措施。充分利用现有的水资源，多搞些引水灌溉；能够打浅水井的地方，可打些浅水井，省工速效；要多方采取措施，节约用水，并且加强田间管理保墒。四、各行各业各部门要大力支援抗旱。当前，抗旱夺丰收也是个大局，各行各业都要为这个大局做出贡献。抗旱所需资金、物资要努力保证供应及时下拨，不能“马后炮”。五、要抓紧有利时机，继续大搞农田水利建设。早一点动手抓农田水利建设就会争取主动，获得更好的效益。
    田纪云还要求，有可能降暴雨的地方和沿海地区还要切实搞好防洪和防台风的工作。
    会上，水利部部长杨振怀介绍了有关地区的旱情和搞好当前抗旱所要采取的措施。
