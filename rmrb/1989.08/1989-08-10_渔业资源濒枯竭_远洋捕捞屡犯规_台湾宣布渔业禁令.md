A series of recent fishery incidents has finally prompted Taiwan's relevant authorities to take action to rectify the industry. The Taiwan "Agricultural Committee" announced a fishing moratorium yesterday, suspending the issuance of any type of fishing license, including new fishing vessels and aquaculture business permits. This moratorium is initially set for one year.

This fishing moratorium is the first of its kind since the first energy crisis in 1970, when the construction of new fishing vessels was banned. The scope of this moratorium is much broader than the previous one, not only prohibiting the construction of new fishing vessels but also the renovation, replacement, and import of old vessels. Additionally, it bans coastal fixed-net fishing and land-based aquaculture.

The reasons for this unprecedented moratorium are multifaceted. Taiwan's fishery officials stated that Taiwan's coastal and near-shore fisheries have been affected by coastal water pollution and overfishing, leading to a gradual depletion of fishery resources. In distant-water fisheries, the restrictions of the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone have become increasingly stringent. High-seas fisheries are gradually being managed by international organizations, restricting operational areas. Taiwanese fishermen, either due to ignorance of regulations or deliberate violations, frequently engage in illegal fishing, leading to frequent incidents of vessel seizures and international fishery disputes.

During the one-year implementation of the fishing moratorium, Taiwan's fishery authorities will limit the number of fishing vessels to prevent blind investments by the public and strengthen fishery management. This moratorium has caused significant shockwaves in Taiwan's shipbuilding industry, severely impacting many small and medium-sized shipyards.

Additionally, as fishing vessels have become a primary tool for maritime smuggling, the Taiwan "Agricultural Committee" decided on August 9 to impose severe penalties on smuggling vessels, with the most severe punishment being the revocation of the vessel's license and the business certificates of its crew and staff.

### 渔业资源濒枯竭　远洋捕捞屡犯规  台湾宣布渔业禁令

    渔业资源濒枯竭　远洋捕捞屡犯规
    台湾宣布渔业禁令
    本报香港8月10日电  最近出的一连串渔业事件，终于使台有关当局下决心整顿渔业。台湾“农业委员会”昨天宣布渔业禁令，暂停核发任何种类的渔业执照，包括新建渔船及养殖等渔业经营权。这项禁令暂定为期一年。
    这项渔业禁令是从1970年第一次能源危机禁建渔船以来，台渔政单位首次提出禁制，但涵盖面比上一次大得多，不仅不准渔船新建，连改建、汰旧换新与输入都不准，而且禁止沿岸的定置网渔业及陆上的养殖渔业。
    被迫作出这项空前禁令的原因是多方面的。台渔政官员表示，台湾在沿海、近海渔业方面，受沿岸水污染及过度捕捞的影响，渔业资源已逐渐趋于枯竭。在远洋渔业方面受200海里经济海域的限制，渔捞限制日趋严格。公海渔业逐渐纳入国际组织共同管理，作业海域受到限制。台湾渔民因不谙法令或蓄意违法，越界捕捞，渔船被扣和渔业涉外纠纷层出不穷。
    台渔政单位在实行渔业禁令一年间，将限制渔船数量，避免民间盲目投资，强化渔业管理。这一禁令在台湾造船业引起震撼。这样一来，将有一批中小造船厂受到严重影响。
    另外，由于渔船已成为海上走私的主要工具，台“农业委员会”9日决定对走私的渔船采取严惩措施，最严重的处罚可撤销渔船执照及干部船员的执业证。
