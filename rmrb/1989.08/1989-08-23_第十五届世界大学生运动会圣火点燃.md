The 15th World University Games Torch is Lit

Xinhua News Agency, Duisburg, August 22nd - (Reporters Jiang Hong, Hu Xudong) The people of Duisburg will never forget this moment—at 5:30 PM on the 22nd, university student athletes from around the world and tens of thousands of spectators gathered at the Weda Sports Park Central Stadium. Federal Chancellor Kohl solemnly declared: the 15th World University Games are open. Athletes and spectators from different countries and regions, with different skin colors, languages, and beliefs, are all basking in the joy of friendship and unity at this moment.

This event is the third time in the history of the World University Games to change the venue at the last minute, and it is also the event with the shortest preparation time. The original plan was to hold the event in Sao Paulo, Brazil. On January 20th of this year, just half a year before the opening, Brazil suddenly announced that due to political and economic reasons, it could not host the event, leaving the Games without a host. The President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and the International University Sports Federation had to urgently appeal to many countries and cities around the world to find a new host. At this critical moment, Duisburg bravely took on this arduous task and completed all preparations in just over four months.

Although this University Games only includes competitions in four events—track and field, rowing, fencing, and men's basketball—it still attracts tens of thousands of participants from around the world with its unique combination of a sports festival and an international university cultural festival. By the time of the opening, a total of 93 countries and regions had registered nearly 3,000 athletes and officials. As of today, 73 teams have arrived. The people of Duisburg will welcome the participants with their characteristic German enthusiasm, generosity, and outstanding organizational work, ensuring that this event will leave a brilliant mark in the history of the World University Games.

The torch of the University Games has been lit at Weda Sports Park. The President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and the President of the International University Sports Federation, Nebiolo, wished all the athletes excellent performances on the field and hoped to deepen the understanding and friendship among the peoples of various countries.

    第十五届世界大学生运动会圣火点燃
    新华社杜伊斯堡8月22日电　（记者江红、胡旭东）杜伊斯堡人终生难忘的一刻——22日下午5时30分，来自世界各地的大学生运动员，和数万名观众汇聚在这里的韦道体育公园中心体育场。联邦德国总理科尔庄严宣布：第十五届世界大学生运动会开幕。不同肤色、不同语言、不同信仰的世界各国和地区运动员、观众此时此刻共同沐浴在友谊和团结的欢乐海洋之中。
    本届运动会是世界大学生运动会历史上第三次临时变更赛址的赛会，也是准备时间最仓促的一次。本届运动会原定在巴西圣保罗举行。今年1月20日，在距开幕仅剩半年时间的情况下，巴西突然宣布由于政治和经济原因无力承办，运动会一时变得没有着落。国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇和国际大学生联合会不得不向世界许多国家和城市发出紧急呼吁，征请新的承办者。在这急要关头，杜伊斯堡市毅然承担下这艰巨重任，并在短短4个多月的时间内完成了一切筹备工作。
    本届大学生运动会虽然只设田径、赛艇、击剑和男子篮球四个项目的比赛，但仍以其集体育盛会和国际大学生文化节为一体的魅力，吸引着世界各地数以万计的参加者。到开幕前为止，共有93个国家和地区的近3000名运动员、官员报名。截至今天，已有73个代表队抵达。杜伊斯堡市人民将以其日尔曼式的热情、豪爽和出色的组织工作，使得本次赛会在世界大学生运动会历史上留下精彩的一笔。
    大学生运动会的圣火已在韦道体育公园点燃。国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇、国际大学生联合会主席内比奥洛在开幕式上预祝各国健儿在赛场上创造出色的成绩，增进各国人民的了解和友谊。
