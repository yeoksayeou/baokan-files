	The journal "Party Building" (combined issue 7-8) published an article by Comrade Deng Xiaoping titled "The Communist Party Must Accept Supervision" ahead of schedule. It then invited a group of old comrades and leaders from relevant departments of the Central Committee to study and discuss this article. The attendees unanimously agreed that Comrade Xiaoping's article is profound and far-reaching in its insights, and it has important guiding significance for strengthening and improving the Party's leadership today.

	The attendees pointed out that the Party accepting supervision is a major issue in Party building. This is determined by the nature, purpose, and position of our Party. To achieve correct leadership, the Party must voluntarily accept supervision from within the Party, from the masses, and from democratic parties and non-party democrats. Only by accepting supervision can the Party avoid bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism, and avoid making major mistakes. Even if mistakes are made, they can be corrected more easily. At the same time, whether or not one dares to accept supervision is a distinguishing feature between those who adhere to the four cardinal principles and those who promote bourgeois liberalization. Those who promote bourgeois liberalization talk about "democracy and freedom," but in reality, they fear public supervision the most. They use the pretext of promoting democracy to advocate that Party members can act freely according to their personal will, attempting to weaken the Party and even abandon its leadership.

	The attendees emphasized that the Party needing supervision does not mean promoting "big democracy." "Big democracy" means causing large-scale disturbances, which can only lead to chaos. Opposing "big democracy" does not mean not promoting democracy; rather, it means having "small democracy" everywhere, that is, seriously implementing the democratic system stipulated in our country's constitution, giving the people a place to speak and offer suggestions.

	The attendees finally expressed that there are many aspects to supervising the Party and Party members, but the key is internal Party supervision, which is more direct and effective. We must overcome the phenomenon of weakness and disintegration within the Party, eliminate corrupt elements, and build our Party to be more mature and combat-ready.

	Those who participated in this discussion included: former Standing Committee member of the Central Advisory Commission Huang Huoqing, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Hu Sheng, and others. Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department Li Yan presided over the meeting.

    《党建》邀请老同志学习座谈邓小平文章
    党要受监督是党建重大课题
    本报讯　《党建》杂志（7—8期合刊）提前发表邓小平同志《共产党要接受监督》一文后，邀请部分老同志和中央有关部门的领导同志，对这篇文章进行学习、座谈。与会同志一致认为小平同志的这篇文章论述精辟，意义深远，对于今天加强和改善党的领导有着重要的指导作用。
    与会同志指出，党要接受监督是党的建设中的一个重大课题。这是由我们党的性质、宗旨和地位决定的。党要实现正确的领导，就要自觉地接受来自党内的、群众的、民主党派和无党派民主人士的监督。党只有接受监督，才能避免官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义，才能避免犯大错误，即使犯了错误也比较容易纠正。同时，敢不敢于接受监督，也是坚持四项基本原则的人同搞资产阶级自由化的人的一个区别。搞资产阶级自由化的人，嘴上讲“民主、自由”，实际上最怕人民监督。他们以发扬民主为名，主张党员可以按个人意愿自由行动，妄图削弱党以致放弃党的领导。
    与会同志强调，党需要监督决不意味着要搞“大民主”。“大民主”就是搞大规模的闹事，只能导致大动乱。反对“大民主”不是不要发扬民主，而是要时时处处地有“小民主”，也就是认真执行我国宪法所规定的民主制度，让人民群众有讲话、提意见的地方。
    与会同志最后表示，对党的监督和党员的监督有许多方面，关键是党内监督，这是更直接、更有效的。一定要克服党内的软弱涣散现象，清除腐败分子，把我们党建设得更加成熟、更有战斗力。
    参加这次座谈会的有：原中顾委常委黄火青、全国政协副主席胡绳等。中宣部副部长李彦主持了会议。
