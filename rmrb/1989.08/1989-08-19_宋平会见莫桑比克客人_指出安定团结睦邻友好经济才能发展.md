Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said today that a developing country can only achieve a good environment for economic development if it maintains a stable and united political situation at home and pursues a policy of good-neighborliness and friendship abroad.

Song Ping made these remarks this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People when he met with a delegation from the Mozambican Liberation Front led by Marciano da Silva, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Inspection Commission.

Song Ping said that based on our experience, a country, especially a Third World country, must formulate policies based on its own actual situation to build its own country well.

He said that with the correct policy and the efforts of the people, the country will develop rapidly.

During the meeting, Song Ping reiterated that China continues to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and strengthening unity and cooperation with Third World countries is a basic point of China's foreign policy.

He said that China will continue to develop friendly and cooperative relations with African countries, including Mozambique.

When discussing the situation in Southern Africa, Song Ping said that the struggle of the people of Southern Africa against racism and their efforts to achieve a political solution to the problems in Southern Africa have made new progress, "We are pleased about this."

He said that the process of the Namibian people's struggle for national independence has entered its final stage, "We firmly support the efforts of the African people, especially the people of Southern Africa, to maintain peace and stability in Southern Africa, and we hope that Namibia's independence will be realized smoothly; we firmly support the just struggle of the South African people against the apartheid system and for national equality and democratic rights."

Marciano da Silva introduced the current situation in Southern Africa and Mozambique. He expressed satisfaction with the continuously consolidating and developing friendly relations between Mozambique and China.

Song Ping recalled his visit to Mozambique in 1986. He hoped that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and the two countries would continue to develop.
