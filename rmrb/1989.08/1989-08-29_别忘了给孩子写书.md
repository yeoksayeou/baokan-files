“Dad, this book is great, can you find me another one?” A 10-year-old boy closed his _Robinson Crusoe_ and was still savoring the story. His journalist father, however, was at a loss. As soon as the summer vacation started, his son kept asking for more books to read, but finding suitable ones was not easy. While his son was watching the animated version of _Don Quixote_ on TV, he spoke up again: “Is there a book for this story? I want to read it!” However, when the book was borrowed, the son flipped through a couple of pages and then pouted, tossing it onto the bed: “It’s boring!” The following days, the books he thought his son would love, Jules Verne’s _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_, _The Mysterious Island_, and _From the Earth to the Moon_, were also discarded one by one. Strange, why did _Robinson Crusoe_ captivate his beloved son so much?

He puzzled over it and took a look, only to realize that it was an abridged version, specifically edited for middle school students. It had no lengthy descriptions that would bore children, simplified the long foreign names, and was very much to the children’s taste.

Children often complain in letters to newspapers and magazines that adults write too few books for them and publish too many. Adults, on the other hand, complain that there are too many books, making their children indiscriminate in their reading choices. Street bookstalls hang signs for renting martial arts, romance, and foreign popular novels, with high rental rates. Books published just a short while ago are already worn out and dirty, with groups of middle school students gathering in front of these stalls every day.

In Shanghai, however, a new trend has quietly emerged. When a child who loves reading has a birthday or starts a new school year, elders bring back beautifully bound sets of books such as _Selected Classics of Chinese Literature_, _Military Knowledge_, or _Readings by Modern Chinese Writers_ from bookstores. School teachers, seeing the Shanghai Education Press’s _Middle School Library_ series, which totals over 300 volumes and is quite impressive, also let out a sigh of relief. Children finally have spiritually nourishing and entertaining reading materials that are beneficial for their growth. Notably, many famous authors are among the editors of this series.

Actually, famous authors writing children’s literature is not a demeaning task. Mao Dun once edited a “clean” version of _Dream of the Red Chamber_ for young readers, and the literary giant Lu Xun enthusiastically translated Dutch author’s long children’s fairy tale _Little John_ in the scorching summer with a pot of tea as his companion.

Currently, there are not just the Shanghai Education Press working against the trend. The Hunan Children’s Press recently published a set of _Children’s Encyclopedia (British Edition)_ (4 volumes) that is highly praised by parents. It can broaden children’s horizons, as the preface says: “Each entry is either an interesting story, a clever science essay, an elegant prose piece, or a beautiful poem.” No wonder many parents, as soon as they buy it, can’t put it down and even don’t mind the 40 yuan price tag. After all, it’s for the children!

The Shanghai Children’s Press, known for publishing _Ten Thousand Whys_ in the 1960s, which influenced several generations, is now working on a sequel to _Ten Thousand Whys_. They plan to include more updated “whys” and assure young readers that it will retain the original “flavor” while adding new “seasoning.”

Walking into the second National Book Exhibition Hall, the colorful and well-bound knowledge books that attract children are particularly eye-catching. The _Yellow River Series_, jointly published by Future Press, Hope Press, Tomorrow Press, and Seagull Press from Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hebei, totals 11 volumes. It aims to inspire national spirit and spread national culture among children and even adults, narrating stories, poems, and geography related to the Yellow River. We should indeed respect such publishing houses.

Currently, almost every middle school student has a copy of _Chinese Idiom Dictionary_, but the Wenhui Press has taken a different approach by compiling and translating a _World Idiom and Anecdote Dictionary_, opening another door to the world for them. Especially when they read explanations like “polishing the apple” and “the unfaithful tomato,” they will laugh and realize that humans indeed have some common weaknesses worth guarding against.

It seems that these are good signs. Writers are no longer just thinking about children during Children’s Day. The significance of this will become more apparent in the future. The only concern is whether parents will be deterred by the increasingly high book prices?

    别忘了给孩子写书
    锡兵
    “爸爸，这本书真棒，再给我找一本好吗？”一个10岁的男孩合上《鲁宾逊飘流记》犹自回味无穷，他那当记者的爸爸却犯开愁了。一放暑假，儿子总嚷着要看课外书，可适合孩子的书一时还真不易找。正盯着电视上《堂吉诃德》动画片的儿子又发话了：“这故事有书吗？我想看！”然而，书借来了，儿子翻了两页便噘着嘴往床上一扔：“没看头！”接下去的几天里，他以为必定大受儿子青睐的儒勒·凡尔纳的《海底两万里》、《神秘岛》、《从地球到月球》也竟被儿子一本本地弃如敝屣。怪了，那么《鲁宾逊飘流记》何以会引得宝贝儿子茶饭不思呢？
    他疑疑惑惑地找出来一看，才恍然大悟，原来那是缩略本，专为中小学生编著的，没有令孩子不耐的大段描写，简化了冗长的外国人名，极合孩子的口味。
    孩子们经常苦恼地投书报章杂志，抱怨大人们给他们写的书、出的书太少了；大人们也忿忿然指责出书多而滥，使他们的孩子饥不择食。街上的书摊则挂起了出租武侠、言情、外国通俗小说的招牌，租借率极高，刚出版没多久的书便被揉搓得又脏又烂，每天这类书摊前围着的多是一些结伴而来的中学生。
    而在上海，最近却悄悄地兴起了这样一种送礼时尚，谁家念书的孩子过生日了或是新学年开始，长辈们从书店里捧回一套装帧精美的《中国古典文学名著选粹》、《军事知识》或是《中国现代作家读本》等。学校老师看到上海教育出版社这套总计300余种，堪称洋洋大观的《中学生文库》，也不由舒了口气，孩子们总算有了有益健康成长却又趣味横生的精神食粮了。而且引人注目的是这套书的编者中有不少名家。
    其实，名家编写少儿读物绝非自贬身价，当初茅盾便曾专为小读者编写过“洁本”《红楼梦》，文学巨匠鲁迅先生更兴致勃勃地在酷暑中以清茶一壶为伴翻译过荷兰作家的长篇童话《小约翰》。
    目前逆着潮流做此类工作的也不独上海教育出版社一家，湖南少年儿童出版社最近发行的一套极受家长欢迎的《儿童百科全书（不列颠版）》（4册）也可以使孩子们眼界大开，正像该书前言中所说：“每一个条目，或是一篇有趣的故事，或是一篇精巧的科学小品，或是一篇隽永的散文，或是一首优美的诗。”无怪乎许多家长刚买到手里，自己便爱不释手地先睹为快了，似乎对那40元的定价也不甚介意。为了孩子嘛！
    上海的少年儿童出版社由于60年代出版《十万个为什么》影响了几代人而声名大振，尽管这套书依然畅销，他们却在着手编写《十万个为什么》续编本了，打算收进更多更新的“为什么”，并向小读者保证既有原来的“风味”，又增加新的“调料”。
    走进第二届全国图书展览大厅，吸引孩子们的色彩鲜艳、装帧讲究的知识类书籍十分触目。由陕晋鲁豫的未来出版社、希望出版社、明天出版社和海燕出版社联合出版的总计11本的《黄河丛书》，以在孩子们甚至成人中弦扬民族精神、传播民族文化为己任，将有关黄河的传说、诗词、地貌等娓娓道来，对这样的出版单位，我们实在应该抱有敬意。
    目前中学生中几乎人手一册《汉语成语辞典》，而文汇出版社却别辟蹊径地编译了一本《世界成语典故辞典》，给他们开启了又一扇通向世界之门，特别是当他们读到“把苹果擦亮”、“不忠实的西红柿”等释义时，失笑之余也会悟出人类的确有着一些值得警惕的共同弱点。
    看来这是一些好兆头，写书的大人们已不至于只是在“六·一”时才想起孩子们，这意义到将来方会愈发显著。只是有一点担心，家长们会不会对越来越高的书价望而却步呢？
