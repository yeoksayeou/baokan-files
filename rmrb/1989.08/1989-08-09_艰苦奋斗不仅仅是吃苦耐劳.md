Some comrades hold the view that hard struggle is simply about thrift and hard work, endurance, because the premise of hard struggle is the word "hard." Indeed, the spirit of hard struggle was formed under the extremely difficult conditions of the revolutionary war years. However, the content of the spirit of hard struggle is not limited to this.

The spirit of hard struggle has a rich connotation. It is a spirit of entrepreneurship, a spirit of progress, and a spirit of sacrifice. The basic meaning of hard struggle is to fear no difficulties and to forge ahead. This is necessary under any conditions, it's just that it takes on different characteristics in different eras. In the revolutionary war years, Communists struggled hard, were willing to sacrifice, gave their lives, and shed blood to win the revolution; during the three years of national economic difficulties, the people of the whole country struggled hard, tightened their belts, worked hard, and finally overcame the difficulties, quickly restoring and developing the national economy. Today, we are in a new historical period, comprehensively carrying out socialist modernization, and the conditions on all fronts are much better than in the revolutionary war years and the years of economic difficulties. Under such conditions, to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, on the one hand, we must emphasize thrift and hard work; on the other hand, while continuing to maintain thrift and hard work, we must more strongly advocate for unity and cooperation in building the "Four Modernizations," diligently studying science and culture, and striving to do our jobs well to create a better life. Realizing the "Four Modernizations" relies on people's hard work and technological progress. Without people who have mastered scientific and cultural knowledge working hard, modernization will not be realized.

Xinglongzhuang Coal Mine is one of China's first-class large modernized mines. Coal miners are no longer the "coal blackies" of the past, but new-type miners who use advanced coal mining equipment. Xinglongzhuang Coal Mine advocates hard struggle, emphasizing the spirit of diligent study, encouraging miners to learn culture and technology, and quickly master modern coal mining techniques to create the best economic benefits; they also pay attention to improving the living conditions of workers on the basis of developing production, encouraging workers to create a better life with their own labor. In this way, the spirit of hard struggle has taken on new characteristics of the times, making it easier to be accepted and becoming a spiritual force to inspire people to build the "Four Modernizations." Carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle and paying attention to combining it with the actual situation of the unit is a beneficial attempt.

    艰苦奋斗不仅仅是吃苦耐劳
    皮子
    有的同志有这么一种看法：艰苦奋斗就是勤俭节约，吃苦耐劳，因为艰苦奋斗的前提就是艰苦二字。确实，艰苦奋斗精神是在革命战争年代极其艰苦的条件下形成的。但是艰苦奋斗精神的内容并不仅限于此。
    艰苦奋斗精神有着丰富的内涵，它是一种创业精神，是一种进取精神，是一种牺牲精神。艰苦奋斗的基本意义是不怕困难，开拓前进。这无论在什么条件下都是需要的，只不过是在不同时代具有不同特色。在革命战争年代，共产党人艰苦奋斗，勇于牺牲，抛头颅，洒热血，夺取了革命的胜利；国民经济三年困难时期，全国人民艰苦奋斗，节衣缩食，辛勤劳动，终于克服了困难，使国民经济很快得到了恢复和发展。今天，我们处于新的历史时期，全面进行社会主义现代化建设，各方面条件比起革命战争年代、经济困难时期，不知要好多少倍。在这样的条件下发扬艰苦奋斗精神，一方面要讲吃苦耐劳，勤俭节约；另一方面，在继续保持吃苦耐劳、勤俭节约的同时，更要提倡同心同德干“四化”，刻苦钻研科学文化，努力做好本职工作，创造更美好的生活。实现
  “四化”，要靠人们脚踏实地的辛勤劳动，靠技术进步。没有掌握科学文化知识的人们的辛勤劳动，就不会有现代化的实现。
    兴隆庄煤矿是我国第一流的大型现代化矿井，煤矿工人已不是昔日的“煤黑子”，而是使用先进采煤设备的新型矿工。兴隆庄煤矿提倡艰苦奋斗，着重提倡刻苦钻研精神，鼓励矿工学文化，学技术，尽快掌握现代化采煤技术，创造最佳经济效益；他们还注意在发展生产的基础上，不断改善职工生活条件，鼓励职工用自己的劳动创造更美好的生活。这样，就使艰苦奋斗精神有了新时代的特色，易于被人接受，成了鼓舞人们干“四化”的精神力量。发扬艰苦奋斗精神，注意同本单位的实际结合，这是一个有益的尝试。
