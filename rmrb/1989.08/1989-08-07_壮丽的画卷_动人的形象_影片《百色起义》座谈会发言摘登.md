Editor's Note: On July 26, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, in collaboration with the Literature Department of this newspaper, held a symposium to discuss the achievements and significance of the revolutionary historical epic "The Baise Uprising." More than 20 comrades participated in the discussion, either in person or through written statements. Below are excerpts from some of the participants' speeches.

A Valuable Teaching Material Rich in Contemporary Significance

Bao Tongzhi: The film "The Baise Uprising," produced by the Guangxi Film Studio, will be shown to the audience on August 1. Now, let's discuss and share our impressions.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the August 1st Film Studio produced "The Great Kunlun Mountains," the Guangxi Studio completed "The Baise Uprising," and the Changchun Film Studio has just finished shooting "The Founding Ceremony." Before the National Day, we also organized the creation and production of other films. We believe that the release of this batch of films for the National Day will change the bleak situation in film creation and production and some incorrect tendencies, further promoting our artists to create more and better films that reflect the revolutionary historical struggle and contemporary life.

Liu Baiyu: The bell of revolutionary history forever rings loudly in the sky. After watching "The Baise Uprising," my first thought was that we must march forward with the bell of revolutionary history!

Due to the constant spread of bourgeois liberalization in the literary and artistic field, "The Baise Uprising" gives people a sense of awakening and freshness. A revolutionary historical film has such a powerful thought-provoking and artistic force, I think, first of all, because it truly reproduces the history of the Communist Party of China, who, with great courage and determination, created a new socialist China. History is not something that can be arbitrarily cut or distorted. After the Great Revolution was brutally suppressed in 1926-1927, rivers of blood flowed, and corpses lay everywhere. The fate of the Chinese nation was hanging by a thread, in grave danger. At that moment, it was the Communist Party members, with the great ideal of communism, starting from China's reality, with great wisdom and courage to counter the White Terror, shouldering the heavy responsibility of saving the people, the nation, and the country from the fire, resolutely rising up and fighting.

Now, this film vividly tells people that it was Comrade Deng Xiaoping who, amidst a thousand dangers, ignited the spark of revolution in Guangxi and led the glorious Baise Uprising. Just after suppressing a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the film recreates on the screen the glorious achievements created by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries from the bloodshed, wiping away the blood of the martyrs. This is a profound education for us, making us understand the solemn truth that "without the Communist Party, there would be no new China."

We cannot overstate our evaluation of this period of history 60 years ago. Marx once said, "Prometheus is the most noble saint and martyr in the history of philosophy." The noble and heroic deeds of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and others at that time were like Prometheus stealing fire from heaven to create a new world.

The film vividly portrays the image of the young revolutionary Deng Xiaoping, accurately and artistically reproducing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's character of seeking truth from facts and daring to fight, thus achieving the artistic power to infect and purify people. By correctly reflecting historical figures, it also correctly reflects the essence of history. As I was immersed in this emotionally charged film, I felt as if I were immersed in the tragic and stirring "Internationale." This film is a good education for us on revolutionary traditions, love for socialist motherland, and love for the Communist Party of China. This counter-revolutionary rebellion once again reminds us that we must firmly remember: forgetting the past means betrayal. The wheels of history 60 years ago are forever moving forward and will never turn back.

Chen Haosu: Filmmakers producing "The Baise Uprising," a film that praises the achievements of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, proves that their feelings are closely connected with the broad masses of the people. We regard the depiction on the screen of the Party and the people fighting under the banner of socialism for national liberation and national progress as our glorious duty. In the past ten years, we have shot many films on major revolutionary historical themes, and "The Baise Uprising" is a very distinctive work in this series.

"The Baise Uprising" is a successful artistic work. The correct political stance and strong sense of social responsibility of the main creators certainly helped the work achieve success, but the decisive factor is their enormous innovative enthusiasm and hard work in the process of artistic production, striving to achieve a higher artistic realm starting from life. This successful innovation is concentrated in the film's portrayal of a living young revolutionary, Deng Xiaoping.

Huang Shixian: "The Baise Uprising" is a major achievement of 1989, a historical epic with an epic atmosphere, color, and grandeur.

We have our own history and should proudly sing its praises. But this segment of history has been overlooked. From the film, it can be seen that the creators' mindset is relatively free. If the artist's subjectivity is not liberated and cannot enter history, this work cannot be created.

For a period of time, the "leaderless tide" has fueled the trend of liberalization. Creators should produce works that lead the tide of the times with a sense of grandeur and strength, reflecting the mainstream ideology. If the creative subject cannot achieve freedom, cannot face history, face reality, and reflect the concerns of the people, the mainstream will certainly weaken. Every nation and every era should have its own spirit of the times, reflecting the spirit of the times and inspiring its people to create their own history. The thought and artistic value of "The Republic Will Not Forget" and "The Baise Uprising" produced by the Guangxi Studio should be fully affirmed.

A Successful Work on Revolutionary Historical Themes

Liang Guangdi: For a period of time, some comrades in the literary and artistic circles have considered films on revolutionary historical themes to be outdated. I believe that such films should be given more attention, not only for their educational value to the audience but also for the development of the literary and artistic team itself.

"The Baise Uprising" is an epic film, combining history and poetry, with history in poetry and poetry in history, faithful to history, and excavating poetry from it, with its unique portrayal of characters' psychology, temperament, and character. "The Baise Uprising" is a film on major revolutionary historical themes and also a film on young themes, successfully portraying the image of a young leader, the "torch of national spirit," which is very enlightening for the younger generation.

Huangmei: The creation of revolutionary historical themes is the most difficult, not only requiring the true and vivid reproduction of the historical appearance, but the key lies in the portrayal of characters, especially whether the images of revolutionary leaders are vivid and vivid, true and believable. The basis of vividness and vividness is truthfulness and believability, the thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and personalities of the characters are just as they are. There is an old Chinese saying, "The eyes are the soul of the dragon." This "eye" is the image of the main leader in a film. "The Baise Uprising" is a great work that has achieved this very well.

It can be seen that the entire period of struggle led by the Communist Party of China is a very rich source of creation that should be deeply excavated. An important feature and fine tradition of the development and prosperity of New China's film art is to reflect China's long, tortuous, and complex revolutionary struggle history, strive to create many brilliant images of great proletarian revolutionaries and various heroic figures, making the film art with a broader mass base play a greater role in spreading revolutionary historical knowledge, conducting revolutionary tradition education, and improving the ideological, moral, and cultural quality of the people. Many excellent films have indeed been shot in the past. Unfortunately, this issue has been seriously neglected in recent years. I, an old soldier of the film industry, also hope that the film industry will start from this year, after "The Great Kunlun Mountains," "The Baise Uprising," and "The Founding Ceremony," reopen a new realm of reflecting revolutionary historical themes.

Yu Qian: Whether creating literature that reflects reality or history is not easy. Some people think that avoiding the contradictions of reality by writing about history would be trouble-free, easy to let the work come to life, easy to stand out or win an artistic laurel, at the very least, it seems overly naive. Although there are quite a few works that have gained "great unity" or other benefits by arbitrarily manipulating history, this has nothing to do with artistic creation. The revolutionary historical struggle life has always been a rich source of literary and artistic creation, but creating works based on important revolutionary historical facts is like climbing Mount Everest. Presenting the Baise Uprising, which has unique creativity in the history of the Communist Party of China and has made important contributions to the revolutionary struggle, in screen images, does this also mean climbing Mount Everest in art? The creators of "The Baise Uprising" also felt that "it is difficult to shoot historical themes, and it is even more difficult to shoot revolutionary historical themes; it is difficult to shoot leader figures, and it is even more difficult to shoot living leader figures. If it is overdone, it is not good; if it is done flatly, it is also not good." And "overdone" or "done flatly" is mainly because it involves how to appropriately portray the historical role of outstanding figures, that is, how to truly give "the content of history back to history." Therefore, I highly appreciate the courage of the creators of "The Baise Uprising" to face difficulties and move forward.

Du Gao: "The Baise Uprising" is rich in revolutionary historical content and portrays very intimate and lively artistic images, both rich in historical truth and full of revolutionary passion, poetry, and humanity. The broad masses of young viewers and the people need to understand the history of the Chinese revolution, especially today. People need to understand the Party's struggle history not only from textbooks but also through artistic works.

There is a tendency in the literary and artistic circles that every time a wrong trend of thought is criticized, some people will ask if literature and art can still flourish, if healthy creative enthusiasm will be injured, and if artists will fall silent? In the past, we did not give enough appreciation and encouragement to some good works, while some things that are not very healthy as a whole often received a lot of praise, forming a situation where the voice of revolution became weaker and weaker, and the voice of the other side became louder and louder. Summarizing the creation experience of "The Baise Uprising," not only for this film but also for the prosperity, improvement, and development of the entire socialist literary and artistic creation, it has significance.

Artistic Handling and Portrayal of Leader Figures

Ding Que: "The Baise Uprising" is a magnificent historical scroll, from which one can see the progress of history, see the revolutionaries pushing the progress of history, feel the collision and surge of emotions between leaders, and open up an emotional space. The artistic charm of this film is not in its revolutionary historical theme but in the creators' high artistic generalization of history and concise introduction of history. As Director Chen Jialin proposed: concise and to the point, without dragging on. This is precisely the cleverness and success of this film.

It can be seen that the development of the film's story has three lines: the local warlords represented by Yu Zuobai; the Kuomintang government represented by Zheng Jiemin; and the Communist Party of China represented by Deng Bing. The three lines intertwine and determine the changes in the situation in Guangxi at that time, forming the historical pattern and pushing the development of the drama and the perfection and richness of the characters. It is not easy to reflect such a complex history in a 100-minute film, which proves the director's deep artistic prowess.

Li Xingye: Sixty years ago, that segment of history is now known by very few people, especially for this uprising that was not a "bang bang bang" bloody battle to see the result, but a "dragon drawn before showing its claws" armed uprising (Deng Bing's words), even fewer people know about it. The film vividly and passionately presents that era of storm and stress, recreating the thriving scene of the uprising, which has valuable cognitive value.

The first half of the film uses documentary techniques to present Deng Bing's complex situation in his united front work with Yu Zuobai and Li Mingrui in a very concise manner. The second half of the film vividly depicts the thriving scene of the great revolutionary struggle of the workers and peasants, with one scene after another on the screen, depicting a magnificent epic, conveying the heartfelt passion, joy, and unyielding heroism of the broad masses of workers and peasants, making today's audience feel the hot and real atmosphere of the Great Revolution at that time, feel beauty and sublimity from it, and achieve a spiritual sublimation.

Zhong Yibing: "The Baise Uprising" is a serious and meticulous creation, a work of accumulation and breakthrough. It provides us with many experiences that can be learned from for future revolutionary historical theme literary and artistic creation. For example, to portray the true and moving artistic image of proletarian revolutionaries, one must emphasize both commonality and individuality, and the fusion of commonality and individuality. In a mature work, the most vivid and lively place of individual portrayal is often the place that best reflects the revolutionary's common sublime thoughts and feelings. The portrayal of Deng Bing in "The Baise Uprising" uses many details to show his optimistic, open, approachable, quick-witted, decisive, and responsible individual characteristics, which precisely deeply reflect the protagonist's revolutionary ideals and aspirations.

Again, history is an objective existence, it cannot be changed or fabricated, nor can it be arbitrarily interpreted; but which segment of history to choose as one's writing material, from which angle to present this segment of history, can arouse today's audience's thinking and resonance, this depends on the writer's thoughts and feelings, depends on the writer's understanding of the times and the people. A mature writer must find a connection point between the historical truth and the contemporary sense before picking up the pen. The connection point in "The Baise Uprising" is: seeking truth from facts.

Chen Bo: "The Baise Uprising" promotes the dramatic development of the film through the portrayal of the main historical figure Deng Bing's thoughts and character, his firm, confident, sharp, and optimistic unique style, and completes the vivid depiction of the main character from the ups and downs of the plot, thus forming the hymn of the great historical event of the Baise Uprising.

I particularly appreciate the opening scene of the film, where Comrade Zhou Enlai finds Comrade Deng Xiaoping, calling out a few times without seeing him, and then, from the narrow attic, comes the energetic and lively Deng Xiaoping. Xiaoping accepts the mission to go to Guangxi, accepts the suit, and it is even "French goods." This series of shots introduces the historical background of being in a secret and arduous environment and strongly introduces the image of the sharp, active, and youthful Deng Xiaoping. It is truly a masterpiece.

At the banquet arranged by Li Mingrui, in response to Yu Zuobai's doubts, Deng Bing clearly answers: "I said it!" One sentence shows Deng Bing's firm, confident, and sharp character. This artistic design and presentation, based on the true life of history, concentrates and condenses, portraying Deng Bing's image as a Communist Party member who dares to take responsibility and is respected by all.

Qin Jin: "The Baise Uprising" particularly emphasizes the authenticity and liveliness of characters. It writes, moves, and brings to life the leader figures, and all of this is not added on, not to avoid "deification" by intentionally adding some content rich in life interest and episodes or internal conflicts, or a few jokes, but to integrate thought and strategy with personality and emotion, making people feel that a revolutionary's thoughts and actions, choices and decisions, etc., are all internal, natural, logical, and understandable to ordinary people. It is not to express the character's thoughts with grand statements but to portray vivid and lively character personalities, making people feel a spiritual power, thought power, wisdom power, and character power, naturally showing the inner charm of the youthful Deng Xiaoping. Therefore, I think that in handling the theme of leader figures, "The Baise Uprising" boldly advances and reaches a new level. The achievements of "The Baise Uprising" are the result of adhering to the socialist literary and artistic direction and the realistic creation path, and at the same time, the result of bold exploration and the continuous development of creative thought and aesthetic concepts. This shows that as long as the correct direction is adhered to and practice is dared, literary and artistic creation will definitely make progress.

Zhang Xinan: The skillful use of individualized language to reveal the distinctive character of the characters is a feature of "The Baise Uprising" in character portrayal. The film has many brilliant descriptions of Deng Xiaoping, often using the character's personality language to vividly portray him. For example, Deng Xiaoping's first appearance, facing the complex struggle situation in Guangxi, he said to Zhou Enlai with a slightly humorous tone: "Complex is good. If it's simple, there's no show to watch." After arriving in Guangxi, at a Party meeting encountering different opinions, even wrong opinions, Deng Xiaoping did not scold with a stern face but said humorously: "You can't perform two shows on one stage!" "You have to sing the song of the mountain where you are!" In the thatched house, Deng Xiaoping's conversation with the chairman of the peasant association Lei Jingtian while smoking a big pipe; in the right river camp, Deng Xiaoping's conversation with Zhang Yunyi, the women's director, and other masses, the language is simple and straightforward, frank and forthright, full of emotion, straight from the heart, with a thick Sichuan local flavor, and very fitting for the character's straightforward personality characteristics. In particular, Deng Xiaoping's speech in the film about proposing Li Mingrui to be the commander-in-chief of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army is moving and touching, vividly portraying a leader figure's respectful appearance and great soul.

Successful Creation Experience Worth Summarizing

Zhong Chengxiang: Our screen is in great need of such excellent films that highly exalt the spirit of revolutionary tradition and the main melody of socialist literary and artistic creation! However, it is undeniable that in recent years, such works have indeed fallen far short of the people's needs. Therefore, I admire and thank the Guangxi Film Studio and its production team for making this film. Guangxi Studio, a small studio on the border, has been able to clearly and wisely plan its film creation from the strategic goal of building socialist spiritual civilization and improving the overall cultural quality of the nation, ensuring that in every year's production of about 5 films, it concentrates its creative and economic advantages to present to the people excellent works that play the main melody of socialist literary and artistic creation (in the 6 films produced in 1988, they have produced two masterpieces, "The Republic Will Not Forget" and "The Baise Uprising"), which is particularly rare and precious. I think this not only has a profound enlightenment and warning effect on some production units that, for the sake of pursuing box office value, blindly cater to popular tastes and produce batches of low-quality "entertainment films" with "blood flowing like a river" and "sexually stimulating" content; but also has valuable reference significance and universal significance for the overall pattern of contemporary socialist film culture construction in our country.

Hou Kuizhong: In order to present this segment of history well, we, as screenwriters, have investigated more than 200,000 words of archival materials in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Guangxi, and visited relevant personnel. At that time, there were only 37 surviving old comrades of the Red Seventh Army, and we interviewed 35 of them. Based on the mastery of a large amount of materials, we studied, analyzed, and learned from the creation experience of some excellent revolutionary historical theme films in the past. It can be said that we are continuing to climb up based on the excellent achievements of our predecessors. We realized that the stronger the political connotation of the film, the heavier the political mission it carries, the higher the requirements for its artistry.

Gao Honghu: Sixty years ago, the Baise Uprising, a vivid and magnificent drama, took place in Guangxi. Therefore, bringing Comrade Xiaoping's glorious image to the screen has become our Guangxi Film Studio's unshirkable and extremely important historical mission. Guangxi Studio is a small studio with only a few hundred people. To complete such a major creation task is beyond our strength. The main reason why we were able to complete this revolutionary historical epic, which mobilized five or six hundred thousand people to participate in the shooting in a relatively short time (the entire shooting work was less than half a year) with relatively little money (the total cost was less than 4 million yuan), is that we received the precious instructions and strong support of the central leaders, the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, especially Vice Chairman Wang Zhen. Comrade Wang Zhen gave very specific guidance on the creation of the script, director, actor selection, and film shooting. The Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, the Film Bureau, the Central Leading Group for Major Revolutionary Historical Themes, the Party and government leaders of Guangxi, the leaders of the People's Liberation Army, the people of the old revolutionary base areas in Guangxi and Baise, and the old soldiers of the Red Seventh Army, etc., all gave great support to the shooting of this film. I, on behalf of Guangxi Studio, express my heartfelt thanks to these comrades!

With the famous director Chen Jialin at the helm, the production team is a disciplined and upright fighting collective. They have overcome various pressures and worked together to finally achieve success in both thought and art. Practice has once again shown the powerful vitality of ideological and political work.

    壮丽的画卷　动人的形象
    ——影片《百色起义》座谈会发言摘登
    编者按：7月26日，本报文艺部和广播电影电视部电影局联合召开座谈会，就革命历史巨片《百色起义》的成就和意义进行研讨。参加座谈的20多位同志发言或书面发言，现将其中部分同志的发言摘发如下：
    一部富于现实意义的好教材
    包同之：广西电影制片厂摄制的《百色起义》将在八一和观众见面。现在请大家座谈，发表观感。
    为庆祝国庆四十周年，八一厂拍出了《巍巍昆仑》，广西厂完成了《百色起义》，长春电影制片厂的《开国大典》刚刚摄制完成，国庆节前也将公演。为国庆献礼，我们还组织了其它一些影片的创作生产。我们相信，这批国庆献礼片的上映，将会改变电影创作生产不景气的面貌和一些不正确的倾向，进一步推动我们的艺术家创作出更多更好的反映革命历史斗争和现实生活的好影片。
    刘白羽：革命历史的钟声永远嘹亮长空。看了《百色起义》之后，我第一个感想就是，我们必须随着革命历史的钟声前进！
    由于资产阶级自由化灰尘不断弥漫在文艺阵地之上，《百色起义》使人有一种振聋发聩、耳目一新之感。一部革命历史题材影片所以有这样强大的催人奋发的思想力量、艺术力量，我想，首先由于它真实地再现了中国共产党披荆斩棘，开荒辟莽，创造社会主义新中国的历史。历史不是可以任人宰割，任人曲解的。在1926—1927年大革命惨遭摧残之后，血流成河，尸横遍野，中华民族生死存亡系于一发，危在旦夕。在那时刻，是中国共产党人抱着共产主义的伟大理想，从中国的实际出发，以反击白色恐怖的大智大勇，肩负起拯救人民、民族、国家于水火之中的重大责任，决然而起，进行搏斗。
    现在这部电影真实而生动地告诉人们，由邓小平同志在千危万险之中在广西点燃了革命的星星之火，领导了光辉的百色起义。在刚刚在北京平息了一场反革命暴乱之后，在银幕上再现老一辈无产阶级革命家当年从血泊之中，擦干烈士的血迹而创造的光辉业绩，对我们的教育太深刻了，使我们懂得“没有共产党就没有新中国”这一庄严的真理。
    我们对于60年前这一段历史作出多么高的评价都不会过分。马克思曾讲过一句话：“普罗米修斯是哲学历史书上最高尚的圣者和殉道者。”邓小平等同志那时的崇高的战斗的行为，就是普罗米修斯盗天火给人间创造新世界的壮举。
    影片真实而生动地刻画了青年革命家邓小平的形象，从艺术上形象地准确地再现了邓小平同志实事求是、敢于斗争的英雄的性格，因此达到了艺术上感染人、净化人的力量。由于正确地反映了历史人物，也就正确地反映了历史本质。当我沉醉于这激情洋溢的影片中，我就如同沉醉于悲壮、激昂的《国际歌》声中。这部电影对我们来说是一次很好的革命传统的教育，热爱社会主义祖国的教育，热爱中国共产党的教育。这一次反革命暴乱，又一次提醒我们必须牢记住一句话：忘记过去，就意味着背叛。60年前转动的车轮是永远前进，绝不倒转的。
    陈昊苏：电影工作者拍出《百色起义》这样歌颂老一辈无产阶级革命家业绩的影片，证明了自己与广大人民群众的感情是息息相通的。我们把在银幕上表现党和人民在社会主义的旗帜下为争取民族解放和国家进步而从事的伟大斗争，当做是自己的光荣责任。最近十年我们已拍摄了许多重大革命历史题材的影片，而《百色起义》是这个作品系列中最近的很有特色的一部。
      《百色起义》是一部成功的艺术作品，主创人员正确的政治立场和强烈的社会责任感当然有助于作品取得成功，但是决定性的因素还是他们在艺术生产过程中倾注的巨大的创新热情和从生活出发力求达到更高的艺术境界所付出的辛勤劳动。而这种成功的创新，集中地表现在影片塑造了一位活生生的青年革命家邓小平的艺术形象上面。
    黄式宪：《百色起义》是1989年银幕一个重大的收获，是一部历史巨片，它带有史诗的氛围、色彩和气度。
    我们有自己的历史，应该理直气壮地歌颂。但这段历史曾经被忽略了。从影片可以看出创作者的心态比较自由，艺术家主体如果得不到解放，不能进入历史，就搞不出这部作品。
    一段时间以来，“无主潮论”助长了自由化的倾向。创作者应该拿出引领时代主潮的有气度、有力度的作品，应该反映主流的意识形态。如果创作主体不能取得自由，不能面对历史，面对现实，反映人民所关切的问题，主潮当然会削弱。任何民族、任何时代都应该有自己的时代精神，反映时代精神，鼓舞自己的人民创造自己的历史。对于广西厂拍摄的《共和国不会忘记》、《百色起义》，应充分肯定它的思想价值和艺术价值。
      革命历史题材的成功之作
    梁光弟：一段时间以来，文艺界部分同志认为革命历史题材的作品过时了。我认为对这类题材的影片应加以重视，不仅仅对观众具有教育作用，对文艺队伍自身的发展也很有作用。
    《百色起义》是一部史诗性的影片，史与诗结合，史中有诗，诗中有史，忠实于历史，又从中挖掘出诗意，在刻画人物心理、性格、气质方面有其独到之处。《百色起义》是重大革命历史题材的影片，同时又是一部青年题材的影片，它成功地塑造了一个青年领袖的形象，是“国民精神的灯火”，对年轻的一代很有启示。
    荒煤：革命历史题材的创作，难度最大的，不仅是要求真实生动地再现历史的面貌，关键在于人物形象，尤其是革命领袖人物的形象是否生动鲜明，真实可信。生动鲜明的基础在于真实可信，人物的思想感情、心理行为、个性与品格恰如其人。中国有句老话叫做画龙点睛，这个“睛”就是一部影片中主要的领袖人物的形象。《百色起义》就是很好地实现了这一点的一部巨作。
    由此可见，中国共产党所领导的整个革命历史时期的斗争的题材，至今还是一个应该深深挖掘的极为丰富的创作源泉。新中国电影艺术的发展与繁荣，有一个重要的特色和优良的传统，就是反映中国漫长的、曲折的、复杂的革命斗争历史，努力塑造许多伟大的无产阶级革命家光辉形象和各种英雄人物的形象，使群众性较广的电影艺术在传播革命历史知识，进行革命传统教育，提高人民的思想、道德、文化素质方面发挥较大的作用。过去也的确拍摄了不少优秀的影片。可惜，这个问题近几年来被严重地忽视了。我这个退役的电影老兵也盼望电影界从今年开始，继《巍巍昆仑》、《百色起义》、《开国大典》之后，重新开拓反映革命历史题材的新境界。
    余倩：文艺创作无论反映现实，还是反映历史，都不是很轻易的。以为避开现实的矛盾而写历史就没有麻烦，就可以随心所欲，就容易让作品成活，容易出头露面或摘取艺术的桂冠，最低限度也是显得过于天真。虽然有不少随意捏弄历史而赚取了“大团结”，或得到了别的种种好处的“作品”存在，这和艺术创造却没有什么相干。革命历史斗争生活历来就是文艺创作的一个丰富源泉，但以重要革命史实为题材进行创作，好像比攀登珠穆朗玛峰还要艰难。把在中国共产党历史上有独创性，并对革命斗争作出了重要贡献的百色起义体现为银幕形象，是不是也意味着要在艺术上去攀登珠穆朗玛峰？《百色起义》的创作者，也感到“拍历史题材难，拍革命历史更难；拍领袖人物难，拍在世的领袖人物更难。搞过了不行，搞平了也不行”。而
  “搞过了”或者“搞平了”之所以“不行”，主要还在于关系到如何恰当表现杰出人物的历史作用，也就是如何真正把“历史的内容还给历史”的缘故。因此我很赞赏《百色起义》的创作者知难而进的勇气。
    杜高：《百色起义》充满丰富的革命历史内容，又塑造了非常亲切生动的艺术形象，既富于历史的真实，又充满了革命激情、诗情、人情。广大青年观众和广大人民需要了解中国革命的历史，在今天尤其如此。人们除了从教科书中了解中国革命史以外，还需要通过艺术作品，形象地了解党的奋斗史。
    文艺界有一种倾向，每当批判一种错误思潮时，总有些人会讲文艺还能不能繁荣，健康的创作情绪会不会被伤害，艺术家会不会沉默下去？过去，我们对一些好的作品评价不够，鼓励不够，而某些总体上说不是很健康的东西，往往能得到许多人的赞扬，形成革命的声音越来越微弱，另一面的声音反而越来越响亮。总结《百色起义》的创作经验，不仅对这部作品，对整个社会主义文艺创作的繁荣、提高、发展，都具有意义。
    艺术处理与领袖形象塑造
    丁峤：《百色起义》是一部壮丽的历史画卷，从中可以看到历史的进程，看到革命者推动历史进程的发展，感受到领袖之间情感的碰撞、激荡，展开了一个感情空间。这部影片的艺术魅力不在于它是革命历史题材，而在于创作者对历史作了高度的艺术概括，对历史的介绍十分凝炼。正如陈家林导演提出的：短小精悍，不拖泥带水。这正是这部影片的聪明之处和成功之处。
    可以看出，影片的故事发展有三条线：以俞作柏为代表的地方军阀；以郑介民为代表的蒋介石国民党政府；以邓斌为代表的中国共产党。三条线交织进行，决定着当时广西局势的变化，构成了历史的格局，也推动着戏剧的发展，推动着人物性格的完善和丰满。在1小时40分钟的影片里反映这样复杂的历史，是十分不易的，证明了导演深厚的艺术功力。
    李兴叶：60年前的那段历史，今天已很少有人知道了，尤其对这一场不是“乒乒乓乓”一番血战才见分晓，而是“龙画好了才显爪爪”的武装起义（邓斌语），了解的人就更少了。影片真实、生动又富有激情地展现了那个风起云涌的时代，再现了如火如荼的起义盛况，具有可贵的认识价值。
    影片的前半部以纪实手段，十分简洁地表现了邓斌在对俞作柏、李明瑞开展统战工作中面临的复杂形势。影片的后半部则富于激情地描绘了如火如荼的工农群众大革命的斗争场面，银幕上一幅幅气势磅礴、排山倒海的画面，描绘出一首壮丽的史诗，传递出广大工农群众发自内心的激情、欢乐与一往无前的英雄气概，使今天的观众感受到当年大革命热烈而又真实的气氛，从中感受到美与崇高，达到一种精神的升华。
    钟艺兵：《百色起义》是一部认真、严肃创作的厚积薄发之作。它为我们今后的革命历史题材文艺创作提供了许多可资借鉴的经验。比如，塑造无产阶级革命家真实、感人的艺术形象，必须共性、个性并重，共性、个性相溶。在成熟的作品中，这种个性刻画得最鲜明、生动的地方，往往也是最能体现出革命家所共有的崇高的思想情感的地方。《百色起义》对邓斌的塑造，是用了许多细节来展示他达观、开朗、平易近人、思路敏捷、善于决断、敢于负责的个性特征的，这恰恰深刻地体现着主人公的革命理想和抱负。
    再如，历史是一种客观存在，既不能改造、杜撰，也不能随意解释；但是，选择哪一段历史作为自己的写作题材，从哪个角度表现这段历史，才能引起今天观众的思索和共鸣，这决定于作家的思想感情，决定于作家对时代和人民的理解。成熟的作家在动笔之前，必须在历史的真实性与今天的时代感之间找到一个连接点。《百色起义》中的这个连接点就是：实事求是。
    陈播：《百色起义》通过对主要历史人物邓斌的思想性格，对他的坚定、自信、锐敏、乐观的特有风貌的刻画，推动剧情层层起伏；又从跌宕的情节发展中，完成主要人物的传神描绘，从而构成百色起义伟大历史事件的颂歌。
    我非常欣赏影片一开头，周恩来同志找邓小平同志，几声呼唤，不见其人，然后，从狭窄的阁楼上，下来了精干活泼的邓小平。小平接受了去广西的任务，接受了西装，而且还是“法国货”。这一组镜头，介绍了处在秘密艰苦环境下的历史背景，又强烈地介绍了敏锐活跃、风华正茂的邓小平形象。真是妙笔
  生花。
    在李明瑞安排的家宴上，针对俞作柏的疑虑，邓斌明确回答：“我说了算！”一句话表现了邓斌坚定、自信、锐敏的性格。这段艺术设计与表现，按历史生活真实，集中凝聚起来，刻画了邓斌作为一个共产党人敢于负责的令人起敬的形象。
    秦晋：《百色起义》特别强调人物的真实性和生活化。它把领袖人物写真了，写动了，写活了，而这一切都不是外加上去的，不是为了避免“神化”而特意加上一些富有生活情趣的内容和反映内心矛盾的情节或者说几句玩笑话，而是把思想谋略与性格情感融为一体，使人感到一个革命家的思考与行动、选择与决断等，一切都是内在的、自然的、合乎逻辑的和常人所能够理解的。它不是用豪言警语来表现人物的思想，而是通过刻画鲜明生动的人物性格，让人们感到了一种精神的力量、思想的力量、智慧的力量和品格的力量，自然地显示出风华正茂的邓小平同志的内在魅力。因此，我认为在处理领袖人物题材上，《百色起义》大胆拓进，达到了一个新的水平。《百色起义》成就的取得，既是坚持社会主义文艺方向、坚持现实主义创作道路的结果，同时也是大胆探索、创作思想和审美观念不断发展的结果。这说明只要坚持正确的方向又勇于实践，文艺创作就一定能够有所前进。
    张西南：善于运用个性化的语言，揭示人物的鲜明性格，是《百色起义》在人物塑造上的一个特色。影片中有不少描写邓小平的精彩之处，往往是通过人物的性格语言来传神写照的。如邓小平第一次出场，面对广西复杂的斗争形势，他以略带诙谐的口吻对周恩来说：“复杂好嘛。简单了就没得戏看了嘛”。到广西后，在党的会议上遇到不同意见甚至是错误的意见时，邓小平没有板起面孔训话，而有些幽默地说：“不能一个台子上演两出戏嘛！”“到哪个山头上唱哪个山头的歌嘛！”在茅屋里，邓小平抽大烟筒时与农会主席雷经天的对话；在右江营地，邓小平与张云逸、妇女主任以及其他群众的对话，语言简明豪爽，痛快淋漓，感情饱满，直抒胸臆，既有浓厚的四川地方风味，又十分切合人物的直率性格的个性特征。尤其是影片中邓小平关于提议李明瑞担任红七军、红八军总指挥的那番娓娓动听的讲话，表现得荡气回肠，感人肺腑，形神毕肖地刻画出一个领袖人物令人崇敬的音容笑貌和伟大灵魂。
    成功的创作经验值得总结
    仲呈祥：我们的银幕，太需要这样高扬着革命传统精神和社会主义文艺创作主旋律精神的优秀影片了！而不容讳言的是，近年来这样的作品离人民群众的需求确实差距甚大。因此，我钦佩和感谢拍制这部影片的广西电影制片厂及其摄制组。广西厂这样一个地处边陲的小厂，近两年来能有胆有识地清醒地从建设社会主义精神文明和提高全民族文化素质的战略目标出发，统筹规划自身的电影创作，保证在每年年产5部左右的影片中集中创作优势和经济优势，为人民奉献出高奏社会主义文艺创作主旋律的优秀作品（在1988年投产的6部影片中，他们就拿出了《共和国不会忘记》和《百色起义》两部力作），这是殊为难能可贵的。我以为，这一点不仅对某些为了片面追求票房价值而一味迎合市趣、粗制滥造成批的“杀”声震天、“血”流成河、“性”相刺目的低劣的“娱乐片”的制作单位，具有深刻的启迪和警策作用；而且对我国当代社会主义电影文化建构的总体格局，也都具有宝贵的借鉴意义和普遍意义。
    侯堉中：为了表现好这段历史，我们作为编剧，先后在北京、广州、广西等地查访了200多万字的档案材料，走访了有关人员。当时还健在的红七军老同志只有37位，我们采访了其中的35位。在掌握了大量素材的基础上，我们研究、分析、学习以前的一些优秀革命历史题材影片的创作经验。可以说我们是在前人取得的优秀成果的基础上继续向上攀登的。我们意识到：影片的政治内涵越强，所负载的政治使命越重，对它的艺术性要求就越高。
    高鸿鹄：60年前，百色起义这场有声有色、威武雄壮的活剧就发生在广西，因此，把小平同志的光辉形象搬上银幕，就成为了我们广西电影制片厂义不容辞的、极其重大的历史使命。广西厂是个仅有三四百人的小厂，要完成这样重大的创作任务是力不从心的。我们之所以能够在较短的时间内（全片摄制工作不到半年）以较少的资金（全部费用不到400万）就完成了这部先后动员五六万人参加拍摄的革命历史巨片，最主要的原因，首先是我们得到了中央领导同志、老一辈无产阶级革命家，特别是王震副主席的宝贵指示和大力支持。王震同志从剧本创作、导演、演员选择到影片拍摄都作了十分具体的指导。广播电影电视部、电影局、中央重大革命历史题材领导小组、广西区党、政领导，解放军某部、广西百色等老区人民、红七军的老战士等等，都给予了这部影片的拍摄工作以巨大的支持。我代表广西厂向这些同志表示衷心的感谢！
    以著名导演陈家林同志为首的摄制组，是一个纪律严明、作风正派的战斗集体，他们顶着各种压力，通力合作，终于获得了思想和艺术上的成功。实践再一次说明了思想政治工作的强大生命力。
