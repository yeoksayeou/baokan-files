Kim Il-sung, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and President of the State, recently reiterated in a conversation with the editor-in-chief of Yugoslavia's "Liberation" newspaper that the Korean people will unify their country in the form of a federation based on the three principles of independence, peaceful unification, and national unity.

Kim Il-sung said that since the liberation of Korea more than 40 years ago, the North and the South have had different systems and have been influenced by different ideologies. Under these circumstances, to avoid confrontation and conflict between the North and the South and to achieve the peaceful unification of the motherland, the only viable path is to form a unified state in the form of preserving two systems and uniting two autonomous governments on the principle of coexistence without one side dominating the other.

He said that the proposal for the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo put forward by the Workers' Party of Korea is the most reasonable form of achieving Korean unification. This proposal aims to center on the common demands and interests of the nation, transcend ideological and systemic differences, achieve national unity, and build a unified state.

In discussing the North and South forming a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games, he said that the North and South forming a unified team to participate in the Asian Games will demonstrate the wisdom and unity of the Korean people, contribute to national reconciliation and unity, and promote cooperation and exchanges between the North and South.

    金日成主席重申
    以联邦制统一朝鲜
    依据自主、和平统一、民族大团结三项原则
    新华社平壤8月11日电　朝鲜劳动党中央总书记、国家主席金日成最近在向南斯拉夫《解放报》总编辑发表的谈话中重申，朝鲜人民将依据自主、和平统一、民族大团结3项原则，以联邦制的形式统一自己的国家。
    金日成说，朝鲜解放40多年来，北方和南方存在着相互不同的制度，受相互不同的思想支配。在这种情况下，要想避免北方和南方的对峙与冲突，实现祖国的和平统一，唯一可行的道路是，在北方与南方一方不压倒另一方的共存原则基础上，以保留两种制度和联合两个自治政府的形式形成一个统一的国家。
    他说，朝鲜劳动党提出的高丽民主联邦共和国方案是实现朝鲜统一的最合理的形式。这一方案旨在以民族共同的要求和利益为中心，超越思想与制度的差别，实现民族的联合，建立统一的国家。
    他在谈到朝鲜北方与南方组成统一队参加第11届亚运会时说，北方和南方组成统一队参加亚运会将显示朝鲜民族的智慧和统一意志，为谋求民族和解与联合，促进北方与南方的合作与交流作出贡献。
