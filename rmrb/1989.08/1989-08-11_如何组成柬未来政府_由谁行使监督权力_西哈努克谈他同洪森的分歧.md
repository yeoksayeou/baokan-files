According to Xinhua News Agency in Paris on August 10, Cambodian Chairman Sihanouk today elaborated on his views regarding the future government of Cambodia, the composition of international supervisory bodies, and a series of issues related to Vietnamese migration. He said that the Cambodian National Resistance Forces have significant disagreements with the Phnom Penh regime on these issues. Whether the two sides can reach a compromise depends on Vietnam.

Sihanouk expressed these views during an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters at his hotel this morning.

He recently submitted his proposal for the composition of a temporary government of the four Cambodian factions to the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue. He said that this proposal has been agreed upon by Son Sann and Khieu Samphan, and can thus be considered the proposal of the Cambodian National Resistance Forces. The formal name of the future government is the Cambodian National Unity Government, with Sihanouk serving as the State President and Prime Minister. The three vice presidents, listed in order of age, are: Son Sann, Khieu Samphan, and Hun Sen. He and the three vice presidents will directly manage the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The three other key departments—Ministry of Interior and Security, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Information—will each have four ministers, with the four participating factions each appointing one. There are also 12 departments handling agriculture, commerce, culture, and other matters, each with one minister, with the four factions each controlling three departments to ensure equal power. Hun Sen advocates for the establishment of a Sihanouk-Hun Sen two-party government, with a parallel Supreme Council headed by Sihanouk as the Head of State and Chairman of the Supreme Council. The vice chairmen will be Hun Sen, Son Sann, and a "moderate figure" from the Khmer Rouge who is acceptable, implying the exclusion of Khieu Samphan and Son Sen.

Regarding the composition of the international supervisory body, Sihanouk drew a diagram and explained: Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime oppose the United Nations leading this body and propose that it should be composed of 12 representatives from six countries. Among these six countries, two are from the Non-Aligned Movement, two from the West, and two from the Socialist bloc, totaling 600 supervisory personnel. Sihanouk, however, advocates that this supervisory body must be led by the United Nations, composed of several countries, with the four Cambodian factions participating in the work but not as members of the body. The number of supervisory personnel should be over 10,000. He said that the gap between the two sides on this issue is also significant.

    如何组成柬未来政府　由谁行使监督权力
    西哈努克谈他同洪森的分歧
    据新华社巴黎8月10日电（记者杨木、薛永兴、沈孝泉）民柬主席西哈努克今天在此间阐明他关于未来柬埔寨政府、国际监督机构的组成以及越南在柬移民等一系列主张。他说，柬埔寨民族抵抗力量在这些问题上与金边政权的分歧甚大。双方能否达成妥协，关键在于越南。
    西哈努克是今天上午在他下榻的旅馆接受新华社记者的专访时表达上述意见的。
    他最近已向柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议提出他对柬埔寨四方临时政府构成的建议。他说，这个建议已获得宋双和乔森潘的同意，故可称柬埔寨民族抵抗力量的建议。未来的政府正式称呼是柬民族团结政府，由西哈努克担任国家主席和政府首脑，三个副主席按年龄排列的顺序是：宋双、乔森潘、洪森。他及三名副主席直接管理外交部。另外三个重要部门——内政安全部、国防部及新闻部——各设四名正部长，由参加政府的四方平等派员组成。还有12个分管工农商文化等事务的部，每个部设一名部长，4方各掌握三个部，以示权力均等。洪森主张成立西哈努克—洪森两方政府，与政府平行的是最高委员会，由西哈努克担任国家元首及最高委员会主席，副主席由洪森、宋双和红色高棉中“一个可接受的温和派人物”组成，意即要排除乔森潘和宋成等人。
    谈到国际监督机构的组成时，西哈努克划了一张图表并解释说：越南和金边政权反对联合国领导这个机构，并主张它应由6个国家的12名代表组成。6个国家中，不结盟、西方和社会主义各占两个国家，共派出监督人员600名。西哈努克则主张，这个监督机构必须由联合国领导，由若干国家组成，柬埔寨四方应参与这项工作但不是这个机构的成员。监督人员应达1万人以上。他说，双方在这个问题上的距离也是很大的。
