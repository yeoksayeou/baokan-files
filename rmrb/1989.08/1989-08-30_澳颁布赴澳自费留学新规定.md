Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th.

Australian Ambassador to China, Mr. Hecolyn, announced today that the Australian government will not accept new applications for self-funded students from China for non-formal education programs with a duration of less than 12 months before January 1, 1990.

The ambassador said the primary reason for suspending new applications is to allow the embassy sufficient time to process the current backlog of applications at the Australian Embassy in China.

The new regulations state that applicants for self-funded study must be under 35 years old; applicants for courses lasting less than one year must not have any family members in Australia simultaneously. The new regulations also state that those who have already applied for self-funded study and have paid tuition and accommodation fees must complete a new survey form and must have completed the equivalent of 10 years of education. For those applying for self-funded study on or after January 1, 1990, they must have completed 12 years of education and pay a visa fee of 160 Australian dollars.

    澳颁布赴澳自费留学新规定
    本报北京8月30日电　记者陈功报道：澳大利亚驻华使馆公使何科林今天宣布，澳大利亚政府在1990年1月1日前将不再从中国招收非正规教育性质、学习期限少于12个月的自费留学生。
    这位公使说，暂停接收新的申请的主要目的是使使馆有足够时间处理目前滞压在澳驻华使馆的申请。
    新的规定说，自费留学申请者年龄不得超过35岁；课程期限不足1年的申请人不得与其任何家属同时在澳大利亚。
    新规定还说，已申请自费留学并已支付学费、住宿费的人必须填写一份新的调查表，必须已完成相当于10年的学业；对明年1月1日及之后申请自费留学的人必须完成12年的学业，并支付160澳元的签证费。
