According to relevant materials, in the coming years, Chinese families will exhibit the following six major trends:

1. **Nuclear Family Structure**: Most families will consist of a core unit of parents and their children. Childless couples will be in the minority. The challenge will be that a couple may need to care for four elderly parents.

2. **Diversification of Occupations**: There will be an increase in urban-rural families and individual household businesses. Young people will seek new meanings in "matching families." Family-run factories and stores will become more common.

3. **Educational Parity**: People will increasingly consider educational attainment as a crucial factor in choosing a partner. Couples with advanced degrees, college graduates, and those with vocational training will become more prevalent.

4. **Economic Disparities Among Families**: Families with members who are quick-thinking, have a strong sense of commodity economics, and are competitive will likely earn higher incomes. Conversely, families that cling to outdated ideas may see their incomes decrease.

5. **Democratization Within Families**: Those who can manage the family dynamics effectively will become the true "heads of the household." Families will no longer be seen as isolated units but as open systems connected to various aspects of society, becoming more open and interactive.

6. **Simplification and Automation of Household Labor**: Young families will increasingly use pre-packaged vegetables, cleaned fish and meat, and convenient lunches. Washing clothes without getting hands wet and automated cooking will become a reality.

    家庭新趋势
    据有关材料表明，近年内我国家庭将呈现出以下六大趋势：
    1、家庭核心化。大多数将是父子代的核心家庭。不要孩子的是少数，问题是将来一对夫妻要照顾4个老人。
    2、职业多样化。将出现不少城乡家庭、个体户家庭。青年人势必追求新含义的“门当户对”。家庭工厂、家庭商店会有所增加。
    3、文化相当。人们要求以文化程度作为重要的择偶条件，研究生夫妇、大中专生夫妇、工人夫妇将较为普遍。
    4、家庭之间在经济上将拉开差距。一些思维敏捷、商品经济观念强、有竞争能力的家庭成员可获得较高的收入；而那些抱住旧观念不放的家庭成员可能收入减低。
    5、家庭成员民主化。打得开家庭局面的人将成为真正的“家长”。人们不再把家庭作为一个相对封闭的组织。而是把它作为与社会各方面联系的渠道，成为开放型家庭。
    6、家庭劳动简便化、自动化。青年家庭更多地使用包装蔬菜、清洁鱼肉、方便午餐等等；洗衣不湿手，烧煮自动化成为现实。
