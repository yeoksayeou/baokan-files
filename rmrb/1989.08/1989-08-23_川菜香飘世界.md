Sichuan cuisine has gained international recognition. The first Sichuan restaurants abroad, Rongle Garden in New York, USA, and Jinjiang Village in Hong Kong, opened in June 1980. By April of this year, Sichuan Province had established 44 Sichuan restaurants in 24 countries and regions, spreading Sichuan cuisine around the world.

Sichuan restaurants abroad have generally received high praise from local patrons, achieving good social and economic benefits. Over the past nine years, they have earned a significant amount of foreign exchange for the country, trained and tempered a large number of talents, and promoted the export of raw and auxiliary materials to earn foreign exchange. Moreover, through these Sichuan restaurants, Chinese culture has been promoted, and friendships have been enhanced.

    川菜香飘世界
    一九八○年六月在美国纽约开张的荣乐园和在香港开张的锦江村川菜馆，是四川省在国外开设的第一批餐馆。到今年四月，四川已先后在二十四个国家和地区开设了四十四家川菜馆，川菜走向世界各地。
    在国外的川菜馆普遍受到当地好评，取得了较好的社会经济效益。九年来，为国家创取了大量外汇，培养、锻炼了一大批人才，带动了原辅材料出口创汇。同时，通过川菜馆这个窗口，宣传了中国文化，增进了友谊。
