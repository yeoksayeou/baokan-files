The sky was overcast with a cloud of uncertainty—economic sanctions, suspension of loans, all the noise and clamor. For years, Yao Chuk, Chairman of the New York International Product Exhibition Consulting Center, has been dedicated to promoting Sino-American trade. How does he feel about all this?

"I am not a politician, but as an American of Chinese descent and a businessman, I hope China will be stable and prosperous. A strong China will bring honor to those of us living abroad. After the Beijing incident, many American businessmen called to ask us: Will China continue to open up? Will the goods we ordered be delivered on time? I think trade cannot be interrupted. During my recent visit to Beijing, I specifically inquired with relevant leaders in the State Council and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Li Lanqing, and others. I have a clearer understanding now. I will soon return to New York. I will tell American clients: China's policies remain unchanged and will open up even more." On July 31, Yao Chuk spoke these words to a reporter at the Beijing Hotel.

An Extraordinary Man with Extraordinary Ideas

Yao Chuk, known as an extraordinary figure in the New York Chinatown business community, hails from Jieyang, Guangdong. He speaks fluent Teochew, is outgoing, and full of energy. In the 1960s, he started his business in Hong Kong, and in the early 1970s, he moved to the United States. In 1975, he began doing business with mainland China. At that time, curious Westerners were fascinated with Chinese martial arts, so Yao Chuk started selling Chinese martial arts weapons in his store, along with "kung fu shoes" produced in mainland China and "kung fu shirts" designed by himself. This was an unexpected hit. Yao Chuk became the appointed agent for "kung fu shoes" for relevant departments in China. His products were not only popular throughout America but also exported to South America and Europe. Adding to this, he successfully promoted Chinese medicinal pills and powders in the United States, truly riding the wave of success and making a fortune. In 1981, he established the Sino-American Commodity Trade Center within the China Trade Center in New York. Over the next eight years, more than ten provinces and cities in China held exhibitions here. Yao Chuk has made significant contributions to the development of Sino-American trade, and American newspapers have dubbed him the "eccentric genius" of the American business world.

The "eccentric genius" indeed has unique thinking and courage.

"Doing business is not just about transactions and markets; the essence lies in thinking of what others have not thought of and doing what others have not done." Yao Chuk's business acumen is unparalleled.

He is not content with just organizing exhibitions and facilitating deals. He understands that American businessmen generally have confidence in developing Sino-American trade, but due to the vast distance between China and America, they know little about Chinese products and the production capabilities of Chinese manufacturers. Although exhibitions are good, they are short-lived, and after the bustle, many gaps remain.

"Why can't Chinese products be displayed in America for a longer period? Why can't we set up a comprehensive, long-term product exhibition?" Yao Chuk's mind was racing again.

The idea of establishing an International Product Exhibition Consulting Center took shape.

A "Commodity Library"

After much effort, this new institution opened in January this year. In the past half year, 23 provinces and cities in China, with over 500 factories, have rented more than 300 booths here to display their products for an extended period. Chinese products are no longer a fleeting sight but bloom eternally.

Some call this place a "commodity library." Indeed, American businessmen coming here are like entering a library, where they can see samples, obtain materials, and inquire about various issues. They can conduct thorough research in advance on how to develop trade with China. The center uses modern information technology to provide consulting services for you; it can also handle orders on behalf of the exhibiting units.

"How many American clients have you contacted? How effective has the 'commodity library' been since its establishment?" the reporter asked.

Yao Chuk proudly presented several meters of computer records: "Look, we have entered over 3,000 major American clients into the computer, and there are tens of thousands of business contacts. American businessmen frequently come to the center to view products and take notes. Trade negotiations sometimes go on until late at night, around 2 or 3 a.m. They demand orders for Chongqing glass cups, Jiangsu shoes, Wuxi fabrics, Foshan light bulbs, Jiangmen door locks, and so on. Since the exhibition, Chinese factories have reached at least $90 million in trade with American clients."

Large-scale, short-term exhibitions are still being organized, and some short-term exhibitions are followed by long-term displays. Since this year, Shantou, Henan, Guangxi, and Shenzhen have all held large-scale exhibitions in New York.

Just in Time

Yao Chuk enthusiastically talked about the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone exhibition that ended on July 15: "After the June 4th incident in Beijing, our center's business cannot be said to be completely unaffected. Some even advised me not to proceed. However, I believe that abnormal phenomena are temporary. Moreover, this is the time when Sino-American trade channels can play a better role. In early July, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone organized 18 companies with strong foreign exchange earning capabilities and integrated industrial and commercial operations to hold an exhibition. In 12 days, they achieved transactions worth over $20 million. Shenzhen also rented 18 booths for long-term exhibitions. They are also preparing to set up a Shenzhen Hall in the center. This has strengthened the confidence of many American and foreign businessmen."

Flowers bloom eternally, water flows continuously.

The president of a trading company in New York told Yao Chuk: "My business is 70-80% in China. How can I not do business with China?" Another company, through the "center" established by Yao Chuk, completed a deal with Guangdong in just three days and issued the first batch of goods' letter of credit on June 22. Believe that the International Product Exhibition Consulting Center, this new window and channel for developing Sino-American trade, will surely shine even brighter!

    花自常开水自流
    ——访纽约“国际产品展示咨询中心”董事长姚楚克
    本报记者　计泓赓
    天空飘浮着一团乌云，什么经济制裁呀，中止贷款呀，喧嚣、鼓噪了一阵。长期为中美民间贸易浇注着心血的纽约国际产品展示咨询中心董事长姚楚克，他是怎么想的呢？
      “我不是政治家，但作为一个美籍华人，作为一个商人，希望中国长治久安，尽快富裕。中国富强了，在海外的人才光采，才被人看得起。北京事件后，很多美国客商打电话问我们：中国是否继续对外开放，我们订的货能否按时交来？我想，贸易哪能中断。这次我在北京特意向国务院有关领导探询，向经贸部副部长李岚清和其他人士打听。我心里明白多了。我马上就要回纽约。我将向美国客户大声说：“中国政策不变，而且将开放得更好。”7月31日，姚楚克在北京饭店对记者谈了这番话。
      奇人奇思
    被誉为纽约华埠商界奇人的姚楚克，祖籍广东揭阳，一口潮州官话，洒脱干炼，富有活力。60年代中在香港从商，70年代初移居美国。1975年就和大陆做生意。当时好奇的西方人迷恋中国武术，姚楚克便在自己商店推出中国练武的十八般武器，还配以大陆出产的“功夫鞋”，自己设计的“功夫衫”。大爆冷门。姚楚克为中国有关部门委任的“功夫鞋”代理商，商品不仅畅销全美，还远销南美和欧洲。再加上他最初在美国成功推销中国膏丹丸散，真是春风得意，大发利市。1981年，他又在经贸部的纽约中国贸易中心里边，创办了中美商品交易中心。8年间，我国十多个省市在这里举办过展销会。姚楚克对发展中美贸易屡有贡献，美国报纸称他为美国实业界的“怪杰”。
    “怪杰”确有独特的思维与胆识。
    “做生意不光要盯着买卖、市场，精髓还在于：别人没有想到的，你想到了；别人没有做到的，你去做了。”姚楚克的经商思维胜人一筹。
    他不满足于已张罗办了多少展销会，促成了多少笔买卖。他了解到，美国商人一般对发展中美贸易信心很足，但由于中美相距万里，他们对中国商品、中国厂家的生产能力和水平，仍知之甚少。展销会虽好，可惜时间短，忙乎一阵过去了，留下的仍是不少空白。
      “为什么不能让中国商品较长时间在美国亮相？为什么不能办一个综合的、长期的商品展示？”姚楚克的脑子又转开了。
    办一个国际产品展示咨询中心的构想形成了。
        “商品图书馆”
    几经努力，今年1月这个全新的机构在纽约开张了。半年来，中国已有23个省市的500多个厂家，在这里租用300多个展位，较长时间地展出产品。中国商品的展出，不再是昙花一现，而是鲜花常开了。
    有人把这里称之为“商品图书馆”。可不，美国商家来到这儿，就像进入图书馆一样，可见到样品，要到资料，查询多种问题，事先即可充分研究与中国如何开展贸易。中心利用现代化信息手段，代你提供咨询服务；还可代参展单位承接订单等。
    “你们联系的美国客户有多少？‘商品图书馆’创办以来实效如何？”记者问。
    哗啦啦，姚楚克向我们展示了几米长的电脑资料：“看，我们输入电脑的美国主要大客户即有3000多家，有业务往来的则达四五万家。美商不断来到中心看产品，做记录。贸易洽谈有时能谈至深夜两三点钟。他们要求订购重庆的玻璃杯，江苏的鞋类，无锡的面料，佛山的灯泡，江门的门锁等等。参展以来，中国厂家至少已与美国客户达成9000万美元的贸易额。”
    大型的、短期的展销会仍照样承接，有的短期展销后还转入长期展示。今年以来，汕头、河南、广西、深圳均来纽约办了大型展销会。
    正是时候
    姚楚克特别兴奋地谈起7月15日刚刚结束的深圳特区的展销会：“北京6月事件后，我们中心业务不能说不受一点影响。有人甚至劝我不要搞了。但是我相信不正常的现象是暂时的。而且，这正是中美民间贸易渠道可以更好发挥作用的时候。7月初，深圳特区组织了18家很有创汇实力、工贸结合的集团性公司来展销。12天展期共成交了2000多万美元。深圳还租了18个展位长期展销。他们还准备在中心搞一个深圳馆呢。这就使不少美商和外商增强了信心。”
    水流不因石而阻，花自常开水常流。
    纽约一家贸易公司的总裁对姚楚克说：“我的生意70—80％在中国，和中国的生意怎能不做？”另一家公司通过姚楚克创办的“中心”，用3天时间即与广东谈成了一笔生意，而且在6月22日开出了首批货品的信用证。相信，国际产品展示咨询中心这个发展中美贸易的新窗口、新通道，必将更放异彩！
