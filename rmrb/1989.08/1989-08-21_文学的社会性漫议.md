I believe that the social nature of literature mainly includes specific attributes such as national character, historical context, people's orientation, political stance, class consciousness, and party spirit. It involves various social factors such as social issues, social psychology, social activities, social trends, and social values, with extremely broad and rich implications. If we take a brief look back, we can find that all the literary works that have caused a sensation and become prominent in the literary world over the past decade are works with strong social relevance, rich in social meaning and value. They either delve deeply into the sensitive points, concerns, and excitements of society at that time, or meticulously depict the historical changes in social relations and practices, or expose major social problems, or are imbued with thick social trends and psychology. As for the most popular reportage literature today, it boldly exposes various real and significant social problems with its sharp and piercing pen, arousing the attention and resonance of the masses, and winning widespread acclaim. Conversely, any kind of literary work, if it lacks social relevance, cannot timely stir the nerves of society, or accurately touch the strings of the people's emotions, it will not be able to cause a sensation or stir the literary world.

It is clear that the presence or absence, strength or weakness of social relevance is directly related to the response of literary works and the prosperity or decline of the literary world. The social nature of literature is not an externally imposed attribute, but an inherent one. After all, society is the soil in which literary works are born, and the literary world is a part of human society. Literature and the literary world are destined to survive and develop only within society. They are always in tune with society, sharing its fortunes and misfortunes, joys and sorrows, and are inseparably linked. Since society exists before literature and the literary world, it is destined to constrain and influence the fate of literature. Even if the umbilical cord is severed, the genes, blood, and skin color are already predetermined and cannot be changed. Society, like a stern and just judge, ultimately examines, screens, and reviews literature to decide its fate, thus determining and influencing the outcome and fate of literature. Once the contradictions, needs, pains, wishes, and joys of society are sensed and artistically concentrated and expressed by literature, society will naturally respond with approval and affection. Conversely, if the contradictions, needs, pains, wishes, and joys of society are ignored or treated coldly, society will likewise retaliate, neglect, and forget literature.

The importance of the social nature of literature also lies in its ability to satisfy people's desire to understand society and life through reading. From the perspective of reception psychology, the vast majority of readers read literary works not only for artistic appreciation and aesthetic pleasure but also to use literature as a window to understand society and life. At this stage, most Chinese people are still in the initial stage of seeking survival and sustenance, far from reaching the level of seeking richness. People's concern for various existing social problems far exceeds their concern for artistic level and aesthetic appreciation.

Literature, as a spiritual product, is also a spiritual consumer good. Whether it can meet the needs of the masses, whether it is marketable and in tune with society and the masses, does not depend on the will of any individual. It must first enter the circulation field, participate in extensive social competition, and accept the ruthless selection and harsh criticism of society and the public. Ultimately, it is society's examination and needs that will select the best and eliminate the worst. Society's needs may seem intangible, but they are actually powerful and possess immense strength. Even the freest and most unrestrained literary gods cannot escape its control. It constantly dominates and influences the survival and development of literature, either openly or covertly, deciding the prosperity or decline of the literary world. Therefore, the success of a literary work largely depends on its ability to meet social needs. Those that can greatly satisfy will cause a great sensation and receive great acclaim, those that can slightly satisfy will cause a small sensation and receive small acclaim, and those that cannot satisfy or are unrelated to the world will inevitably be forgotten and abandoned, ultimately unable to survive. Similarly, the prosperity or decline of the entire literary world largely depends on whether it can meet the needs of society.

Some experimental and avant-garde literatures often face cold treatment, hardship, and criticism because they despise social content, overly focus on the self, and pay little heed to social needs. In this sense, literature, if it wants to thrive and develop, must consider the needs of readers, face the needs of society, pay attention to social psychology, and strengthen its connection with social life to serve society.

Of course, serving society does not mean that literature should only passively reflect, imitate, copy, and follow society, step by step, allowing itself to be controlled and manipulated by society. Literature that does not reflect social life is weak and pale, lacking autonomy and independent value. It can only reflect and imitate the world like a mirror with little use, inevitably facing the disdain and contempt of society and people. On the contrary, while reflecting, it should also transcend, create and elevate in recording and reflecting, and while serving society, it should not be vulgar or worldly, maintaining its own loftiness, dignity, and independence. Only then can literature win the love and attention of the people. Therefore, while deeply revealing, concentrating, and reflecting society, literature should also transcend society's current thoughts and ideas, lighting a lamp of ideals and a torch to guide the way, to guide and navigate. While providing people with enjoyment, it should also inspire and help people actively build and transform society, develop society.

    文学的社会性漫议
    蔡毅
    我认为，文学的社会性主要包括民族性、历史性、人民性、政治性、阶级性、党性等具体属性，涉及社会问题、社会心理、社会活动、社会思潮、社会价值等多种社会因素，含义极广极丰。只要我们稍作回顾，便可发现，凡是近十年来在文坛上引起轰动、蔚为大观的文学作品，莫不是社会性很强、富有社会意义和社会价值的作品。它们都或深入地涉及到了当时社会的敏感点、关注点和兴奋点，或细致地描绘了社会关系社会实践的历史变迁，或揭示了巨大的社会问题，或浸润着浓厚的社会思潮、社会心理。至于当今最走红的报告文学，更是以它的尖锐犀利的笔触大胆地揭示各种现实的重大社会问题，唤起广大民众的关注与共鸣，赢得了广泛的赞誉。反过来看，任何种类的文学作品，若社会性淡薄，不能及时地牵动社会的神经，不能准确地叩响民众的感情之弦，它便不可能引起社会的激动和轰动。
    很明显，社会性的有无、强弱，直接牵连着文学作品反响的大小和文坛的盛衰。文学的社会性不是强加的外在属性，而是一种内在属性。社会毕竟是文学作品赖以产生的土壤，文坛毕竟是人类社会的一方天地，文学与文坛都注定只能在社会中生存和发展，它们总是与社会声息相通、荣辱与共、悲喜交溶、紧密相联无法分割的。社会既先于文学文坛而生，这就决定了它将制约和影响着文学的命运，即便割断脐带，但它的基因血液肤色都已是命定而不可更改的；社会又像个威严公正的法官，它又最终检验筛选和审查着文学而决定自己的弃取，这又决定和影响着文学的结局和命运。社会的矛盾、社会的需求、社会的病痛、社会的愿望一旦被文学感应并浓缩集中艺术地表现出来，社会自然会对之报以赞许和厚爱；相反，社会的矛盾需求病痛苦乐愿望一旦受到漠视冷淡，它同样会施加报复，冷落和忘却文学。
    文学的社会性的重要，还在于它能够满足人们认识社会和人生的阅读欲望。从接受心理来看，绝大多数读者之所以爱读文学作品，不仅是要进行艺术鉴赏和获取审美愉悦，也是想借文学打开认识社会、洞悉人生的一扇窗口。现阶段的中国人大多尚处在求生存、求温饱的初级阶段，达不到求丰富的水平。人们对现存的各种社会问题的关注是远远超过对艺术水平、审美鉴赏之类的关注的。
    文学作为一种精神产品，它同时也是一种精神消费品。它能否满足广大民众的需要，是否适销对路并与社会和民众相通共振，并不取决于哪一个人的意志，它首先得进入流通领域，参与广泛的社会竞争，接受社会和公众无情的选择、苛刻的挑剔，最终由社会检验和社会需求来择优汰劣。社会需求表面无影无形，骨子里却强悍无比，拥有巨大的力量，任何自由不羁的文艺之神也难逃脱它的掌心与操纵。它无时无刻不在支配和影响着文学的生存与发展，或明或暗地决定着文坛的盛衰。因此一部文学作品成就的大小很大程度上取决于它能满足社会需要的大小。能大满足者则可以引起大轰动大赞誉，能小满足者则可引起小轰动小赞誉，不能满足者或与尘世无干的则免不了被人遗忘与抛弃，最终无法存活。同理，整个文坛的盛衰很大程度也取决于它能否满足社会的需要。
    某些探索文学、先锋文学的时常遭到冷遇、困顿和责难，常常也是由于它们鄙薄社会内容，过分专注自我，太不顾及社会需求所致。从这个意义上来说，文学欲兴旺发展，就必须要考虑读者的需求，正视社会的需要，重视社会心理，就要强化它与社会生活的联系，为社会服务。
    当然，为社会服务，并不意味着要求文学只消极地反映、摹仿、复制、追随社会，一步一趋地听任社会的支配摆布。不反映社会生活的文学是贫弱苍白、没有自主性、没有独立价值的文学，它由于只能折射摹仿再现世相如同一面用处不大的镜子，难免要遭到社会与世人的白眼与唾弃。相反，在反映的同时有超越，在纪录折射中有创造与升华，在为社会服务的同时不媚俗媚世，保持自己的崇高、尊严和独立自主，文学才更能赢得人民的喜爱与关注。因此，文学在深刻地揭示浓缩反映社会的同时，又要超越社会当时的所思所想，给社会燃起一盏理想的明灯、照路的火炬，来指路导航。它在给人以愉悦享受时，又要激励和帮助人们去积极地建设和改造社会、发展社会。
