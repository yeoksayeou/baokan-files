The Hong Kong Women's Football Association Chairman Chen Yaoqin revealed that Chinese Taipei has decided to send a team to participate in the seventh Asian Cup Women's Football Tournament to be held in Hong Kong in December.

Chen Yaoqin called the Chinese Taipei Football Association on the 19th to inquire about their intention to send a team to the Asian Cup Women's Football Tournament. A committee member of the Chinese Taipei Football Association said that the association has decided to participate in the tournament, but the formal reply letter needs to be sent after the chairman's signature.

It is understood that the Chinese Taipei Football Association will reorganize the women's representative team next month to prepare for the Asian Cup Women's Football Tournament and the women's football competition at the Asian Games to be held in Beijing next year.
