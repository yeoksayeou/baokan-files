A highway construction project with Chinese characteristics, focusing on standardization and beautification, is being smoothly implemented on some major highways in China and is gradually being promoted to all major highways nationwide. This marks a new level in China's highway construction.

The content of the standardized and beautified highway construction project involves using new maintenance methods and, as much as possible, combining them with construction methods to standardize the management of highway alignment, pavement, subgrade, bridges, culverts, and other structures, as well as roadside facilities and greening. The 108 National Highway managed by the Hanzhong Highway Bureau has achieved a 50% reduction in annual maintenance costs per kilometer for sections that meet the standardized and beautified road requirements.

    公路实施标准化美化工程
    本报讯　一项具有中国特色的公路标准化、美化建设工程，正在我国一些公路干线顺利推行，并逐步推广到全国所有的干线公路上。这标志着我国公路建设达到一个新水平。
    公路标准化、美化工程的内容，就是利用新的养护手段，并尽可能结合基建手段，对公路的线型处理、路面、路基、桥涵等构造物、沿线设施、公路绿化等进行规范化的管理。陕西汉中公路总段管养的108国道，凡实现了标准化、美化路要求的路段，年公里养护成本降低了50％。　（焦轩）
