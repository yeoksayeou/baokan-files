After the summer vacation, many middle schools organize travel activities, which undoubtedly helps to cultivate students' moral character and broaden their horizons. However, some students have a mindset of comparison and extravagance when it comes to spending money, leading to an incorrect consumption psychology.

The author saw a group of middle school students having a picnic in a park. Under the trees, each student had a variety of foods in front of them, including canned drinks, canned goods, champagne, sausages, fruits, and more than 10 different types of food. The author asked one of the students: "Can you eat all these foods?" The student replied: "Everyone else buys a lot of good food, and if I buy less, it seems embarrassing." The author even saw some students throwing food at each other, which was truly heartbreaking to witness.

The author hopes that teachers and parents in schools can guide students correctly in their travel consumption, helping them to develop good habits of thrift and frugality, and to establish a correct consumption concept.

    中学生旅游应注意节俭
    放暑假后，不少中学组织旅游活动，这无疑对陶冶同学们的情操和增长阅历大有裨益。但有的同学在花钱上存在攀比思想和大手大脚现象，形成一种不正确的消费心理。
    笔者在公园见到一群游园的中学生，他们在树下席地就餐，每人面前都摆着许多食品，有易拉罐饮料、罐头、香槟酒、火腿肠、水果等10多种食品。笔者问一位中学生：你们买这么多食品能吃了吗？他回答说：同学们都买许多好吃的，自己买少了显得寒碜。我甚至看见有的学生用食品互相扔着玩儿，浪费得实在让人痛心。
    笔者希望学校的老师和家长们能正确引导学生们的旅游消费，使他们养成勤俭节约的良好习惯，树立正确的消费观念。
