The progress in biotechnology research is rapid and ever-changing. In recent years, biotechnology research has made new developments, primarily by directly inserting exogenous target genes into plants or animals to produce drugs. Currently, scientists are actively researching the use of mammals themselves as future bioreactors, serving as fermentation tanks to produce drugs, industrial enzymes, and valuable items needed by humans.

A year ago, the American Integrated Gene Company obtained human tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) from the milk of recombinant transgenic mice. Later, the company also bred goats carrying the TPA gene and obtained TPA from goat's milk. Some predict that with just 300 goats expressing TPA, it would be enough for cardiovascular patients worldwide.

Recently, the Animal Physiology and Genetics Research Institute in Edinburgh, UK, has successfully transferred a human coagulation factor gene into sheep and achieved expression. This factor is a blood clotting protein that can be used to treat hemophilia. The institute also successfully transferred the α-1-antitrypsin gene into sheep, and α-1-antitrypsin has been detected in the sheep's milk. The company hopes to sell these products by the early 1990s, thereby reducing the cost of producing human proteins.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School in the United States have successfully created transgenic mice carrying human oncogenes and obtained the first patent for transgenic experimental animals. These mice can be used to identify anticancer drugs and screen for carcinogens. In the future, it may also be possible to develop transgenic mice for medical or drug trials for diseases such as AIDS and heart disease.

Another growth area in biotechnology for pharmaceutical research is the use of live cell therapeutics—second-generation drugs.

Currently, several newly established companies and old pharmaceutical factories in the United States are using live cells processed in vitro. Some insert a specific gene into cells to construct genetically engineered cells, compensating for the lack of certain biochemical substances in patients due to genetic defects. Then, these recombinant cells are injected into the patient's body to achieve therapeutic effects. For example, severe combined immunodeficiency is caused by damage to tissues that produce adenine deaminase, leading to immune deficiency. Now, this disease can be treated with gene therapy, which involves first expressing the gene that produces this enzyme in skin or blood cells using genetic engineering methods in vitro, and then transplanting the recombinant cells into the patient's body for treatment. In addition to gene therapy, live cell therapeutics have other forms, with research objects such as cancer. Some researchers are studying fetal cell transplants. This involves taking pancreatic precursor cells or precursor medullary tissue from aborted fetuses and transplanting them into patients to compensate for the lack of certain biochemical substances in patients. For example, pancreatic precursor cells can provide insulin for diabetic patients, and precursor medullary tissue produces 5-hydroxytryptamine, providing neural transmission for Parkinson's disease patients, thereby achieving a cure.

    医药产业传佳音
    张树庸
    生物工程研究进展，日新月异。近几年生物技术研究又有了新的发展，主要是把人们所需要的外源目的基因直接插入植物或动物，产生药物。目前，科学家们积极研究把哺乳动物本身视为未来的活体工厂，作为发酵罐，用以生产药物、工业用酶和人们所需要的珍贵物品。
    一年前美国集成基因公司从重组型转基因小鼠乳中得到了人组织型纤溶酶原激活剂（TPA）。后来该公司又培育出带TPA基因的山羊，从羊奶中得到了TPA。有人预测，只要有300只羊表达产生的TPA就够全世界心血管患者使用。
    不久前，英国爱丁堡动物生理和遗传研究所，已将人的一种凝血因子基因转移到绵羊中，并成功地获得表达。该因子是一种血液凝固蛋白，可用来治疗血友病。该研究所还成功地将a—1—抗胰蛋白酸基因转移到羊身上，从羊的奶汁中已测出α—1—抗胰蛋白酶。该公司希望在90年代初能销售这些产品，从而降低了人体蛋白的生产成本。
    美国哈佛大学医学院的学者研究成功了携带人类致癌基因的转基因老鼠，已获取第一个转基因实验动物专利。这是可用含有致癌基因的小鼠鉴定治癌药物，也可用以筛选致癌物质。将来也可以发展对艾滋病和心脏病进行医学或药物试验的转基因鼠。
    生物工程在医药研究上的另一个生长点是活细胞治疗剂——第二代药物。
    目前，美国几家新办的公司和老制药厂正在使用在体外加工好的活细胞。有的是将某一基因插入细胞内，构建成遗传工程细胞，以弥补因基因缺陷引起患者对某些生化物质的缺失，然后，再将这种重组细胞注入患者体内，达到治疗目的。如重度免疫缺陷综合症是因产生腺嘌呤核甘朊脒基酶的组织受损，造成免疫缺陷所致。现在，此病可进行基因治疗，这就是在体外先用遗传工程方法将此产酶基因在表皮或血液细胞中得到表达，把重组细胞移入患者体内进行治疗。活细胞治疗剂除基因治疗外，还有其他的形式，其研究对象是诸如癌症等。还有人研究胎儿细胞的移植。这就是从流产的胎儿身上取出前胰岛细胞或前髓组织，并将其植入患者体内，以弥补患者某些生化物质的缺乏，即前胰岛细胞能给糖尿病患者提供胰岛素，以及前髓组织产生5—羟色胺，给帕金森症患者提供神经传递，从而得到治愈。
