Recently, during a visit to a mountainous county, it was discovered that many households that had "escaped poverty" a few years ago had once again fallen below the poverty line and become targets of poverty alleviation efforts again. Some party and government officials lamented, "We patch one hole only to find another; we can't keep up."

Poverty alleviation work is a long-term and arduous task in impoverished mountainous regions, requiring a great deal of in-depth and solid work. The phenomenon of "escaping poverty" only to "relapse into poverty" is not only due to the fact that poverty alleviation efforts have not alleviated the spirit, focusing only on "blood transfusions" and neglecting the cultivation of the farmers' own blood-producing capabilities, but also because some party and government leaders in impoverished regions have contracted "acute poverty alleviation syndrome." They are often busy reporting poverty alleviation figures and are satisfied with signing various poverty alleviation responsibility letters, but they do not solve the long-term, fundamental practical problems of impoverished regions in a solid manner. Therefore, the phenomenon of "escaping poverty" only to "relapse into poverty" can occur. One important reason for the "acute poverty alleviation syndrome" is that some higher-level party and government departments lack a comprehensive understanding of the local situation, are satisfied with signing "timely poverty alleviation responsibility letters" and the like, and force lower-level cadres to engage in window dressing and falsify reports, which has a bit of the flavor of forcing the growth of seedlings. Higher-level departments should also reflect on this.

From this, it can be seen that to change the phenomenon of "poverty alleviation—escaping poverty—relapsing into poverty" and gradually move towards prosperity, the first step is for cadres to overcome the "quick victory" mentality, not to engage in window dressing, and to tailor measures to people, places, and times. While vigorously developing "short, flat, fast" economic projects, special attention should be paid to adjusting the industrial structure, enhancing production momentum, and strengthening self-sustaining capabilities. Only then can the "disease of poverty" be eradicated and the "roots of wealth" be firmly established!

    说“急性脱贫症”
    李国民　袁聪
    近日到一山区县采访，得悉该县许多地方前几年已经“脱贫”的农户有不少又重新处于贫困线以下，再次成了“扶贫”对象。一些党政机关的领导苦恼地说：“我们补了东墙又漏西墙，补不赢哟。”
    扶贫工作是山区贫困地区一项长期而又艰巨的任务，需要做大量深入扎实的工作。之所以出现“脱贫”而又“复贫”的现象，除了扶贫未扶志，只管“输血”，忽视了农民自身造血功能的培养等外，还在于一些贫困地区的党政领导犯了“急性脱贫症”。他们往往忙于申报扶贫的数字，满足于签订各种各样的扶贫责任书，而没有扎扎实实解决贫困地区长远的、带根本性的实际问题。因此，“脱贫”又“复贫”的事就有可能发生。造成“急性脱贫症”的一个重要原因是，一些上级党政部门对基层状况缺乏全面了解，满足于签订“限期脱贫责任书”之类的东西，逼迫下面的干部搞花架子，谎报“军情”，有点拔苗助长的味道。一些上级部门对此也是应该有所反思的。
    由此看来，要改变“扶贫——脱贫——复贫”的现象，逐步走上富裕的道路，首先是干部要克服“速胜论”，不搞花架子，因人、因地、因时制宜，在大力发展“短、平、快”等经济项目的同时，要特别注重产业结构的调整，增强生产后劲和自身造血功能，“贫病”才能除根，“富根”才能长牢！
