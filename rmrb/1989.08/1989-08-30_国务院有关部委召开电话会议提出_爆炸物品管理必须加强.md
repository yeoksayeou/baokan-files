The nationwide telephone conference on strengthening the management of explosives was held tonight at 8 PM at the Ministry of Public Security. Vice Premier and Minister of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry Zōu Jiāhuá presided over the meeting. Vice Premier and Minister of Public Security Wáng Fāng, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Materials Supply Lù Shùshēng, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry Táng Zhòngwén, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Chén Yàobāng, and Deputy Minister of Labor Lǐ Bǎoyǒng attended the conference and delivered speeches.

Deputy Minister of Public Security Yú Léi gave an important speech. After fully affirming the achievements made by various places in implementing the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Management of Civil Explosives," he pointed out that there are still some problems in the management of explosives, mainly manifested in chaos in key links such as use and sales, and the lack of implementation of safety management systems and measures. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, the failure to strictly implement the "Regulations," and on the other hand, some local public security organs do not attach enough importance to this work, failing to strictly manage, supervise, and inspect. Therefore, to truly strengthen this work, it is necessary to implement the principle of "whoever is in charge, whoever is responsible" and adopt various means, including administrative, economic, and legal measures, to promote the further implementation of the safety management systems and measures for explosives.

Yú Léi required local public security organs, under the leadership of local party committees and governments, to work with relevant departments to conduct a concentrated inspection and rectification of the safety management of explosives in their regions and, in accordance with the requirements of the "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Civil Explosives" issued by the General Office of the State Council in 1987, to truly strengthen the routine management of explosives.

    国务院有关部委召开电话会议提出
    爆炸物品管理必须加强
    本报北京8月30日讯　记者徐运平报道：全国加强爆炸物品管理电话会议今天晚上8时在公安部召开。国务委员兼机电部部长邹家华主持会议。国务委员兼公安部部长王芳、物资部副部长陆叙生、机电部副部长唐仲文、农业部副部长陈耀邦、劳动部副部长李伯勇等出席了电话会并先后讲话。
    公安部副部长俞雷作了重要讲话。他在充分肯定各地贯彻执行《中华人民共和国民用爆炸物品管理条例》方面所取得的成绩后指出，爆炸物品管理方面还存在一些问题，主要表现为在使用、销售等关键环节上存在混乱现象，安全管理制度和措施不落实。究其原因，一方面是没有严格执行《条例》，另一方面是一些地方公安机关对此工作重视不够，没有严格管理、监督、检查。因此，要切实加强这一工作，必须贯彻“谁主管、谁负责”的原则，采取行政的、经济的、法律的等各种手段，促使爆炸物品安全管理制度、措施的进一步落实。
    俞雷要求各地公安机关在当地党委、政府的领导下，会同有关部门对本地区爆炸物品安全管理工作开展一次集中的检查整顿，并按照国务院办公厅1987年《关于切实加强民用爆炸物品管理的通知》的要求，切实加强爆炸物品的经常性管理。
