	Soviet Scientist Proposes New Viewpoint: Global Warming is Beneficial

	Xinhua News Agency, London, August 29th — According to a report by the magazine "New Scientist," the renowned Soviet climatologist Mikhail Budyko believes that the "global warming caused by the greenhouse effect is a good thing." This viewpoint directly opposes the prevailing theory that the greenhouse effect is harmful.

	The majority of climatologists around the world believe that global warming will cause droughts in the mid-latitude grain-producing regions, and the recent droughts in the American Midwest over the past two years are a sign of this. Therefore, effective measures should be taken to prevent the greenhouse effect.

	However, Budyko argues that droughts are temporary. If global warming continues until the middle of the next century, rainfall will be more abundant, leading to greater harvests. He believes: "Restricting the consumption of carbon fuels is not only ineffective but also dangerous."

	Budyko predicts that the amount of rainfall in the Sahara Desert of Africa will increase by 30 centimeters, enough to allow nomadic tribes to move their cattle and sheep into new pastures; the amount of rainfall in the barren lands of Central Asia will increase by 50% compared to now, turning those areas into farmland. Climate warming will make the vast lands of the Soviet Union and Canada prosperous.

	Soviet scientists, based on their studies of ancient climates using tree rings and pollen fossils, have discovered that climate change has a cyclical pattern, repeating 20 times over the past 2 million years. The last ice age reached its peak 18,000 years ago, after which the Earth suddenly warmed up. From 8,000 years ago to 6,000 years ago, the Earth reached a warm period, then began to cool down, slowly moving towards the next ice age.

	The most recent warm period was the "climate optimum," similar to the impending greenhouse world. Eastern and Western paleoclimatologists agree that there were basically no deserts at that time, and crocodiles and hippos lived in the heart of the present-day Sahara Desert.

	The United Nations' international group studying climate change is currently advising politicians from various countries on the possible impacts of global warming. Budyko's arguments may spark a debate, ultimately determining which side may take the dominant position. This debate involves the strategies that various countries will adopt towards the greenhouse effect, making it a matter of great significance.

    苏科学家提出新观点  全球气候转暖是好事
    新华社伦敦8月29日电  据《新科学家》杂志报道，苏联著名气候学家米哈伊尔·布迪科认为，由温室效应引起的“全球转暖是一件好事”。这一观点同目前世界上流行的温室效应有害论针锋相对。
    世界上绝大多数气候学家认为，全球转暖会使中纬度世界产粮区发生干旱，近两年来美国中西部的旱灾就是一种迹象。因此，应采取有效措施阻止温室效应。
    但是，布迪科说，干旱是暂时性的，如果全球转暖继续到下个世纪中期，雨量会更加充沛，带来更大丰收。他认为：“限制碳燃料的消费不但没有用，而且是危险的。”
    布迪科预言，非洲撒哈拉大沙漠的降雨量将增加30厘米，足以使游牧民族赶着牛羊迁入新的牧场；中亚不毛之地的降雨量将比现在增加50％，使那里变成农田。气候转暖将使苏联和加拿大辽阔的土地繁荣起来。
    苏联科学家根据树木年轮和花粉等的化石研究古代气候时发现，气候变化有一个循环周期，在过去的200万年内重复了20次。在18000年前最近一次冰河期达到顶峰后，地球突然转暖。从8000年前到6000年前，地球达到暖期，然后又开始冷下来，慢慢地走向下一个冰河期。
    最近的一次暖期是“气候最佳期”，它类似即将到来的温室世界。东方和西方的古气候学家一致认为，那时候基本上没有沙漠，在现今的撒哈拉大沙漠中心有鳄鱼和河马。
    联合国研究气候变化的国际小组，现在正在就全球转暖的可能影响，向世界各国政治家提出建议。布迪科的论点可能引起一场辩论，最终将决定哪一派有可能占统治地位。这场辩论涉及世界各国对温室效应采取的对策，因此事关重大。
