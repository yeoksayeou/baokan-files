Longzi County is one of the major wheat-producing areas in our province, with an annual wheat planting area of over 160,000 mu. Wheat straw is an excellent raw material for papermaking. In recent years, some paper mills have purchased wheat straw without paying in cash, issuing IOUs instead, and delaying payment for the straw. Some farmers have had to visit the mills multiple times to demand payment without success. Some farmers have resorted to burning the straw as fuel.

This issue has drawn the attention of the Longzi County Committee and the county government. Before this year's wheat harvest, they collaborated with the county's 8 paper mills and over 200 specialized straw collection households, as well as the Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Agricultural Bank, to study and decide on three channels to solve the funding issue for purchasing straw: increasing bank loans, mills raising funds and tapping potential, and attracting some foreign investment. The county committee and government also tasked relevant departments with strengthening supervision and implementation to ensure fair transactions, with money and goods exchanged promptly and no delays in payment. Currently, the paper mills have sufficient raw materials, farmers' incomes have increased, and the utilization rate of straw has more than doubled compared to last year.

    把了一道关　增收三百万
    长子县收购小麦不打白条
    长子县是我省小麦商品粮基地之一，年播种小麦在16万亩以上。麦秸是造纸的好原料。近年来，有些造纸厂家收购麦秸时，不付现款，给农民打白条，拖欠麦秸款。有的农民登门讨要十几次还拿不到钱。有些农民便将麦秸当柴烧。
    这一问题引起了长子县委、县政府的重视。今年麦收之前，他们与本县的8家造纸厂和200多个收麦秸专业户，以及工商银行、农业银行等金融部门共同研究，决定通过银行增加贷款，厂家自筹挖潜，吸引部分外资3条渠道，解决收购麦秸的资金。县委、县政府还责成有关部门加强监督落实，确保买卖公平，钱货两清，概不拖欠。现在，造纸厂原料充足，农民收入增加，麦秸利用率较去年增长2倍多。
