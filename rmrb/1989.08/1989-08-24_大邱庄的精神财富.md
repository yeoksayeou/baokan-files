The prosperity of Dagang Village in Tianjin is well-known, and it is one of the wealthiest villages in the country. People often talk about its impressive material wealth, but its spiritual wealth is less known.

While creating material wealth, Dagang Village has also strengthened its collective cohesion, party and government construction, and promoted the spirit of Dagang Village. Yu Zuomin, the Party Secretary of Dagang Village Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Joint Company, said, "When material wealth is abundant, spiritual wealth must also be rich. The two civilizations are one; separating them will lead to failure."

Everyone feels the warmth of the collective

The wealth brought to the people of Dagang Village has not led to indifference or a decline in social ethics. Instead, the village retains a strong collective spirit and is filled with a rich socialist sense of community.

The people of Dagang Village live in a strong, wealthy, and reliable collective. They know that personal savings will eventually be spent, but the collective's business continues to develop, providing a strong support. Therefore, in Dagang Village, the collective is richer than the individual. Everyone can feel the superiority of socialism. For example, in Dagang Village, housing is free, and building a house costs nothing; electricity bills are paid per household, and medical fees are paid per person, with standards set for free services; single-child families receive subsidies, with girls receiving more than boys; school fees are fully waived, and junior high school students receive a substantial monthly scholarship; Dagang Village also has retirement benefits, with women aged 55 and men aged 60 receiving monthly subsidies, and funeral expenses are covered for the elderly.

In Dagang Village, everyone feels the warmth of the collective. Women who undergo sterilization surgeries receive visits from officials who bring money, eggs, and brown sugar to their homes, and there are no cases of overpopulation in the village; eligible young people in the village eagerly enlist in the military because military dependents receive an annual living allowance, and enlisted youth have no worries; bachelors also have someone to help them find a wife, with party committee members personally arranging marriages and providing assistance with housing, registration, and job placement. In this collective, the elderly are taken care of, and the young are educated, stabilizing people's hearts, smoothing their emotions, uniting their spirits, and mobilizing their enthusiasm. This is Dagang Village.

The villagers care about the collective

Every person in Dagang Village also cares about the fate of the collective. Farming expert Ma Delian, who suffered from cancer, spent his last three days before passing away inspecting Dagang Village's farmland, leaving behind the words, "Our land is not yet fully treated, and it still needs to be treated!" Ma Delian had a deep love for Dagang Village, as the collective had nurtured him, transforming him from an ordinary farmer into a farming expert, party member, Tianjin City Labor Model, and representative of Chinese farmers who visited France. When he fell ill, the general company sent people to invite doctors to treat him, and every possible method was used to prolong his life and reduce his pain. Ma Delian had elderly parents and three children in school, but because of his contributions to Dagang Village, the party committee called on the entire village to learn from him, providing his children with an annual allowance of 5,000 yuan until they grew up.

Is it because Ma Delian had a reputation that he received such special treatment? No, ordinary people also receive help from the collective when they encounter difficulties. Li Minliang, 70 years old, had a quiet life and made no special contributions to Dagang Village. He suffered from multiple chronic illnesses and found it difficult to go out for medical treatment. The general company specially installed a telephone in his home to make it convenient for doctors to visit. This incident had a significant impact on the villagers, who felt that the collective of Dagang Village cared for everyone.

In Dagang Village, when one person faces difficulties, everyone helps; when the collective faces difficulties, everyone works together to overcome them. Yu Zuozhang and Liu Wankui's sons were involved in a car accident, resulting in one death and one injury. Village cadres and villagers spontaneously donated more than 100,000 yuan, making them feel warm-hearted because they received something more precious than money. During the initial stage of building the electrical appliance factory, funds were scarce. To promote products, a contract signing meeting was held, and employees voluntarily donated more than 80,000 yuan. In the past two years, some of the factories established by Dagang Village needed funds for new projects, and the employees voluntarily proposed not to receive their salaries, choosing to share the difficulties together. As a result, salaries were delayed for half a year.

Li Fengzhuang, deputy director of the Dagang Village office, said to the reporter, "Each of our cadres has dedicated themselves to the collective, working from morning to night, rarely attending to household matters, because our personal affairs do not need to be taken care of by ourselves; the collective takes care of everything." This is the cohesive force of the Dagang Village collective. The spirit of collectivism permeates the behavior of every villager.

Party discipline and unity of the people

In the past, it was said, "Villages look at villages, households look at households, the masses look at cadres, and party members look at the party branch," and this still holds true in Dagang Village.

The party organization in Dagang Village has high prestige. The party committee's leadership is fair, has decision-making power, and represents the interests of the masses, forming a leadership core. The common people regard them as the backbone.

In Dagang Village, it is not easy to join the party. In Dagang Village, whoever contributes the most is respected the most. Therefore, joining the party is a wish that requires great effort to achieve.

The standards for selecting party members and cadres in Dagang Village are unique: those who have not made contributions, do not respect their parents, do not educate their children well, and men who are afraid of their wives (referring to not allowing their wives to participate in politics) are not allowed to be cadres. Without this, you would not be able to manage others with a straight and confident attitude. In addition, the party committee has strict regulations for party member cadres: they are not allowed to accept invitations from the masses, not allowed to accept gifts from the masses, not allowed to exchange gifts among party member cadres, not allowed to use public property to curry favor and build relationships, and not allowed to use their positions to handle personal matters. These requirements are known to the masses, and at the end of each year, the entire village discusses the cadres in various forms and venues, which is known as the "three difficult passes": the year-end summary pass, the public opinion pass, and the family pass. Calculate how much you have contributed to the collective this year, talk about your shortcomings in public morality and discipline, and if you have not done well, then you will not only not be able to hold your head high in the village, but you will also not be able to explain yourself to your parents, wife, and children.

Bad practices cannot gain a foothold in Dagang Village. If someone does something wrong and tries to slip away, it is not that easy. If you throw a piece of melon rind on the ground or pick a flower, someone will stop you. In the eyes of the common people, it is public property, and even a blade of grass or a tree should be cherished.

Dagang Village established a moral committee, which is composed of more than a dozen retired old party members and cadres. These respected old party members are responsible for mediating neighborhood disputes, managing weddings and funerals, managing market environmental sanitation, and evaluating good daughters-in-law in the village. As the old people say, "Whatever is immoral, we will manage; whatever is moral, we will promote."

The comprehensive management has produced a good party style and folk customs, the most important of which is the cultivation of the sense of honor of the people of Dagang Village. Whether they are party members or the masses, whether they are adults or children, they all strive for the glory of Dagang Village.

Dagang Village has a saying: "We are not worried about food and clothing, but we are worried about the lack of business development." They regard building achievements as a life pursuit, so the people of Dagang Village are always in a state of continuous progress. This year, during the rectification and reorganization, they proposed the "three cleans": cleaning up property, personnel, and thoughts. The people of Dagang Village want to leave more spiritual wealth for future generations.

    大邱庄的精神财富
    本报记者　孟晓云
    天津大邱庄的富有是早就出了名的，可以说是在全国也是名列前茅的。人们喜闻乐道的是它显赫的物质财富，而对它的精神财富可能知之不详。
    大邱庄创造物质财富的同时，在加强集体的凝聚力、党政建设、弘扬大邱庄精神的过程中，获得一笔比物质财富更加宝贵的精神财富。大邱庄农工商联合公司党委书记禹作敏说：“物质富了，精神也必须富有，两个文明是一家，分家必败家。”
    每个人都感受到集体的温暖
    财富给大邱庄人带来的并非人情淡薄，世风日下，相反，这个村庄依然保留着强烈的集体主义色彩，充满了浓郁的社会主义人情味儿。
    大邱庄人生活在一个强大、富裕、可靠的集体里，他们知道，个人存款再多，总有花完的时候；而集体的事业不断向前发展，才会有强大的靠山。因而，在大邱庄集体比个人更富有。每个人都能感受到社会主义的优越性。比如，在大邱庄住房不花钱，建房不要钱；电费按户、药费按人，订出标准，给予免费；对独生子女给予补贴，女孩比男孩补贴得多；学生学杂费全免，初三的学生每月发一笔可观的奖学金；大邱庄还有退休金，55岁的妇女、60岁的老头每月给补助，老人死了还有丧葬费。
    在大邱庄，每个人都感受到集体的温暖。妇女做结扎手术，干部把钱、鸡蛋、红糖送到家里，全村没有一户超生的；村里的适龄青年，应征踊跃，因为军属每年可领取一笔生活补贴，入伍的青年没有后顾之忧；老光棍汉说媳妇也有人管，党委成员曾亲自为他们穿针引线，并从住房、落户、安排工作方面给予照顾，在这个集体里，老有所养，少有所教，人心稳了，气顺了，心齐了，积极性也就调动起来了，这就是大邱庄。
    村民心中装着集体
    每一个大邱庄人也都关心着集体的命运。种田能手马德良患了癌症，告别人世的前三天还在地头转，查看着大邱庄的每一块农田，临终留下的遗言是“咱们的地碱还没有治完，还得治啊！”马德良对大邱庄有着发自内心的热爱，是这个集体养育了他，使他由一个普通的农民成长为种田能手，入了党，当上了天津市劳动模范，还做为中国农民的代表出访过法国。他病了，总公司派人四处请大夫为他瞧病，为了延缓他的寿命和减少痛苦，一切办法都想到了。马德良上有老下有三个读书的子女，因为他为大邱庄做过贡献，他死后，党委号召全村人向他学习，每年发给子女抚养费5000元，直到他们成人。
    是不是因为马德良有声望才获如此殊待？不，普通百姓有了困难，集体同样会伸出温暖的手。70岁的李民亮一生平平淡淡，对大邱庄也说不上有什么特殊贡献，他身患多种慢性病，出门看病很困难，总公司特为他家安了一部电话，为的是请大夫方便。这件事在乡亲们中反响很大，人们从中感到大邱庄这个集体在关注着每一个人。
    在大邱庄，一人有难，大家相助，集体有难，共度难关：禹作章和刘万全的儿子在一次车祸中一死一伤，村干部和村民自动捐款万元以上，他们俩心里热乎乎的，因为他们得到了比金钱更为宝贵的东西。电器厂建厂初期资金短缺，为了推销产品要开订货会，职工主动捐款8000多元；前两年，大邱庄办的一些厂子为了上新项目，需要资金，职工们主动提出，工资我们先不领了，咱们共度难关。结果工资晚发了半年。
    大邱庄办公室副主任李凤庄对记者说：“俺们每个干部都把自己交给了集体，从早忙到黑，很少过问家务，因为俺们个人的事不用自己操心，集体全包了。”这就是大邱庄集体的凝聚力。集体主义精神渗透在每一个村民的行为之中。
    党风正人心齐
    过去不是说“村看村，户看户，群众看干部，党员看支部”么？在大邱庄这一条至今仍然有效。
    大邱庄的党组织威信很高，党委一班人办事公正，有决策能力，代表了群众的利益，形成了领导核心，老百姓把他们看成主心骨。
    在大邱庄入党很不容易，在大邱庄谁贡献大，谁就受人尊敬。因此，入党是要做出很大努力才能实现的愿望。
    大邱庄选拔党员当干部的标准很独特：没做出贡献的、不孝顺父母的、教育不好子女的、男人怕老婆的（指不许夫人参政）统统不能当干部，不如此，你管别人就理不直气不壮。再加上党委对党员干部有严格规定：不准到群众家里吃请，不准接受群众的礼物，不准党员干部之间请客送礼，不准拿公物送人情拉关系，不准利用工作之便办私事。这些要求群众都知道，每逢年终，全村人以各种形式在各种场合普遍议论一次干部，人们称之为难过的三关：年终总结关，群众舆论关和家庭关。算一算你这一年对集体有多大的贡献，说一说你公德和纪律方面有什么毛病，如果你干得不怎么样，那么你不仅在村里抬不起头，在父母、老婆、孩子那里都交待不过去。
    歪风邪气在大邱庄成不了气候，一个人做错了事想滑过去也没那么容易，你随地扔块瓜皮、摘朵花都有人管，在老百姓心目中，是公共财产，哪怕是一草一木也要爱护。
    大邱庄成立了一个道德委员会，这是由十几位退下来的老党员、老干部组成的，这些德高望重的老党员在村里负责调解邻里纠纷，主办婚丧嫁娶，管理集市环境卫生，评比好儿媳妇等等。用老人们的话说：“凡是不道德的事，我们都管，凡是道德的事我们都提倡”。
    综合治理的结果，产生了好的党风和民风，其中最重要的一条是，培养了大邱庄人的荣誉感，不论党员还是群众，不论大人还是孩子，都为大邱庄争光。
    大邱庄有一句口头禅：“不愁吃不愁穿就愁事业没发展”，他们把建功立业当做一种人生追求，所以大邱庄人总处在一种不断的进取中。今年以来，他们在治理整顿中，又提出了“三清”，即清财物，清人员，清思想。大邱庄人要为后代留下更多的精神财富。
