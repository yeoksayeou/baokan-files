The Central Committee of the Communist Party held a discussion with representatives of the National Organization Department Directors' Conference. Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to focus on strengthening the Party's construction. Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Li Ruihuan attended and delivered important speeches. Song Ping presided over the meeting.

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 21 (Reporters Li Shangzhi and Sun Benyao) - General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Jiang Zemin, this afternoon, during a discussion with attendees of the National Organization Department Directors' Conference, pointed out that vigorously strengthening the Party's construction is a reliable guarantee for the smooth progress of China's reform and opening up and socialist modernization. Each level of the Party Committee must focus on strengthening the Party's construction.

Jiang Zemin said that the state of the Party organizations and the Party membership must be correctly assessed. Our Party has 48 million members and nearly 3 million grassroots organizations. The struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the rebellion has proven that our Party cannot be toppled by any hostile forces. The vast majority of Party organizations and the broad masses of Party members stand on the Party's side and have performed well; at the same time, there are many problems within the Party. This turmoil has exposed the seriousness of the problems within the Party. He emphasized that in analyzing the state of the Party, one must not underestimate the impact of international hostile forces attempting to make socialist countries undergo peaceful evolution on our Party; one must not underestimate the damage caused by the rampant bourgeois liberalization on Party construction; one must not underestimate the chaos and losses caused by Zhao Ziyang's mistakes in actual work.

This National Organization Department Directors' Conference of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government began on August 18. The theme of the conference is to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and discuss issues related to strengthening the Party's construction. The Central Committee attaches great importance to this conference. Members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan, along with Candidate Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat Ding Guan'gen, and Candidate Member of the Secretariat Wen Jiabao, held a discussion with all the attendees.

The discussion was presided over by Song Ping, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee. Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, Zhao Zongnai, reported on the discussion and the opinions and suggestions on Party construction work. Sheng Wen, Director of the Organization Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee, Zhong Shuyue, Director of the Organization Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Wang Jingmao, Director of the Personnel and Labor Bureau of the Aerospace Industry Department, spoke at the meeting, sharing their views on strengthening Party construction work in their respective regions and departments.

Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Qiao Shi, and Jiang Zemin then delivered speeches.

Li Peng said that this Organization Department Directors' Conference is very necessary and timely. It is an important conference that will have a significant impact on eliminating the erroneous influence of Zhao Ziyang in Party construction and on future Party construction and reform and opening up.

Li Peng said that Zhao Ziyang not only made mistakes in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party in this political struggle but also, during his tenure as the Party's General Secretary, advocated for "elite" governance of the Party and the country, which actually meant eliminating the Party's leadership. These actions have had a very harmful impact on Party construction work. In future Party construction work, we must vigorously eliminate these influences and build a strong Party.

He said that the recent turmoil and rebellion have been a strict test for every Communist Party member and cadre. The majority of Party members and organizations have clearly opposed the turmoil and rebellion, but some Party members and organizations have not been clear in their stance, have had confused thoughts, or have even made mistakes. He emphasized that for ordinary Party members and the masses, the main issue is one of ideological education. Through learning, we must change our thoughts and achieve the goal of uniting and educating the majority. However, for Party member leaders at all levels, there must be stricter requirements. Those leaders who sympathize with and support the turmoil must seriously reflect and engage in self-criticism, accept criticism and supervision from the masses, and truly solve problems from the heart.

Li Peng said that in recent years, we have achieved great success in selecting and using cadres according to the standards of revolutionization, youthization, intellectualization, and specialization. However, this turmoil and rebellion have also given us much to reflect on. A Party member cadre must have integrity and be upright, but this is not enough. We must also see if their communist faith is firm, their political stance is correct, and especially their attitude towards upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization.

Li Peng said that in future Party construction work, we must emphasize the principle of democratic centralism, which is that the minority must obey the majority, the individual must obey the organization, the lower levels must obey the higher levels, and the entire Party must obey the Central Committee. In a past period, the concept of democratic centralism within the Party has weakened, and there have been situations where orders are not followed and prohibitions are not heeded. Now, emphasizing this issue has practical significance.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee produced the Central Leadership Core with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary. All Party members must support and uphold this core. This is very important for the long-term stability and prosperity of our Party and country, for upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, for carrying out reform and opening up, and for advancing the cause of socialist modernization.

Jiang Zemin said that the broad masses of Party workers, including those on the organizational front, are the backbone of Party construction. They are the ones who uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, uphold reform and opening up, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and seriously implement the Party's basic line. Many comrades on the organizational front are not satisfied with and have resisted Zhao Ziyang's errors of weakening and undermining the Party's leadership.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that political system reform must be beneficial to strengthening and improving the Party's leadership. The purpose of political system reform is to strengthen and improve the Party's leadership, not to weaken or undermine the Party's leadership, and certainly not to eliminate the Party's leadership. He said that the Party's leadership is mainly reflected in: formulating and implementing a correct political line. The line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is correct and must be fully upheld with one central task and two basic points. The political core role of Party organizations at all levels must be fully played. The Party is a unified whole organized according to the principle of democratic centralism. Denying the role of grassroots Party organizations will inevitably weaken the Party's leadership. Leadership teams and cadres at all levels must be built according to the "four modernizations" policy and the principle of both virtue and ability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that the Party must manage the Party, first managing Party members and then managing cadres. The principle of the Party managing cadres must be upheld, and methods must be improved. The vanguard and model role of Communist Party members in the masses must be brought into play. The Party is the vanguard of the working class, and strengthening the Party's leadership must rely wholeheartedly on the working class.

Jiang Zemin said that we must seize the current favorable opportunity to seriously study, strengthen Party construction, and do a good job in cadre assessment work. Jiang Zemin emphasized that corrupt elements must be severely punished, and the relationship between the Party and the masses must be strengthened. He said that the spread of corruption within the Party has seriously damaged the relationship between the Party and the masses and has become an excuse for domestic and foreign hostile forces to subvert the Party's leadership and the socialist system. The blood-and-flesh bond between the Party and the people is the source of the Party's strength. As long as we always represent the interests of the people, our Party will be able to withstand any storm and will forever stand unshakable.

He said that the anti-corruption struggle is a matter of life and death for the Party. The Central Committee is determined to carry out the anti-corruption struggle to the end. No matter who is involved, as long as they have violated Party discipline and laws, they must be investigated to the end; no matter how many people are involved, corrupt practices that have become prevalent must be resolutely stopped. All disciplinary and legal cases must be handled according to the law. Starting from the Central Committee, we must vigorously promote the spirit of hard work and diligence, and do practical things that the masses care about. We must prevent formalism and not engage in short-lived campaigns. We must establish effective institutions to constrain the abuse of power and strengthen supervision and inspection of cadres at all levels.

Jiang Zemin said that thought construction must be placed in a prominent position in Party construction. Currently, we must use the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the important speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping to unify the thoughts of the entire Party. He said that the struggle against bourgeois liberalization must be carried out for a long time. This struggle must be combined with education to strengthen Party spirit. We must correct the thoughts that have been confused by bourgeois liberalization, including the chaos caused in the Party's ideological and theoretical construction, one by one.

Jiang Zemin said that democratic centralism is a good system and tradition that our Party has formed over several decades. As Comrade Li Peng just said, the minority must obey the majority, the individual must obey the organization, the lower levels must obey the higher levels, and the entire Party must obey the Central Committee. This is a principle that must be emphasized in future Party construction work. We must also educate Party members to prioritize long-term interests over immediate interests, national interests over personal interests, and overall interests over local interests. We must educate the entire Party and the people to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and diligence, work hard for a few years, and do a good job in the work of rectification and adjustment.

He said that youth is our future, and we must pay great attention to ideological education for young people. We must have a sense of responsibility, strengthen our work, and proactively work to educate the younger generation with proletarian ideology.

Jiang Zemin said that we must advocate for active ideological struggle within the Party. We must seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism, use correct thoughts to overcome incorrect thoughts, distinguish right from wrong, unify understanding, and strengthen unity. We must improve the Marxist theoretical quality of Party members, especially leading cadres. We must seriously study Marxist philosophy and political economy and use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to observe and handle problems.

Qiao Shi spoke on the current Party construction, which must be carried out around the basic line of one central task and two basic points, and strengthening the construction of leading cadres. Li Ruihuan spoke on anti-corruption and propaganda for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.

    党中央领导同全国组织部长会议代表座谈
    江泽民强调聚精会神抓党的建设
    李鹏乔石李瑞环出席并作重要讲话宋平主持会议
    新华社北京8月21日电　（记者李尚志、孙本尧）中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在同出席全国组织部长会议的同志座谈时指出，大力加强党的建设是我国改革开放和社会主义现代化建设顺利进行的可靠保证，各级党委一定要聚精会神地抓好党的建设。
    江泽民说，要正确估计党组织和党员队伍的状况。我们党是有4800万党员、近300万个基层组织的大党。制止动乱和平息暴乱的斗争证明，我们党是任何敌对势力也搞不垮的。绝大多数党组织和广大党员是站在党的立场上的，表现是好的；同时，党内也存在不少问题，这次动乱，集中暴露了党内问题的严重性。他强调指出，分析党内状况时，不可低估国际敌对势力企图使社会主义国家和平演变对我们党造成的影响；不可低估资产阶级自由化泛滥对党的建设的破坏；不可低估赵紫阳同志的错误在党内造成的混乱和对实际工作的损失。
    这次全国省、自治区、直辖市党委组织部长会议是8月18日开始召开的，会议的主题是贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神，讨论加强党的建设问题。中共中央对这次会议十分重视。中共中央政治局常委江泽民、李鹏、乔石、宋平、李瑞环，中共中央政治局候补委员、书记处书记丁关根，书记处候补书记温家宝，同出席会议的全体同志进行了座谈。
    座谈会由中共中央政治局常委、中共中央组织部部长宋平主持。中组部副部长赵宗鼐在会上介绍了大家讨论的情况和对党建工作提出的意见和建议。辽宁省委组织部部长尚文、湖北省委组织部部长钟书樵、航空航天部人事劳动司司长王景茂，先后在会上发言，结合他们地区、部门的情况，谈了对加强党建工作的看法。
    接着，李鹏、李瑞环、乔石、江泽民先后讲了话。
    李鹏在讲话中说，这次组织部长会议很必要、很及时，是一次重要的会议，它对消除赵紫阳同志在党的建设方面的错误影响，对今后党的建设和改革开放，都必将产生重要的作用。
    李鹏说，赵紫阳同志不但在这次政治斗争中犯了支持动乱、分裂党的错误，而且在担任党的总书记时期，在政治上和干部路线上搞“精英”治党治国，主张改造党、淡化党的领导，实际上是取消党的领导。这些，都对党建工作带来了十分有害的影响。在今后的党建工作中必须大力消除他的这些影响，把党建设好。
    他说，这次几十天的动乱和暴乱，对每一个共产党员和干部来说都是一场严格的考验，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱、暴乱的党员和党组织是大多数，但也有少数党员和党组织态度不够鲜明、思想混乱，甚至有过错误言行。他强调，对一般党员和群众主要是思想教育问题。要通过学习，转变思想，达到团结教育大多数的目的。但对各级党员领导干部，就要有更加严格的要求，那些同情、支持动乱的领导干部必须有认真的检讨和自我批评，接受群众的批评和监督，彻底转变立场，真正从思想上解决问题。
    李鹏说，这些年来，我们按照革命化、年轻化、知识化、专业化的标准，在选拔、使用干部方面成绩是很大的，但通过这次动乱和暴乱，也有值得反思的地方。一个党员干部品德端正、廉洁奉公都是必须的，但仅有这些还不够，还要看他共产主义的信仰坚定不坚定，看他的政治态度如何，特别是对坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的态度。
    李鹏说，今后在党的建设工作中，还要强调党的民主集中制的原则，这就是要少数服从多数，个人服从组织，下级服从上级，全党服从中央。过去一个时期，党内民主集中制的观念淡薄了，出现了一些有令不行，有禁不止的情况。现在强调这个问题有现实意义。
  　党的十三届四中全会产生了以江泽民同志为总书记的中央领导核心，全党同志都要支持和维护这个核心，这对我们党和国家的长治久安，对坚持四项基本原则，搞好改革开放，推进社会主义现代化事业，是非常重要的。
    江泽民讲话说，广大党务工作者包括组织战线的干部是党的建设的骨干力量。他们是坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放，反对资产阶级自由化的，是认真执行党的基本路线的。组织战线的许多同志对赵紫阳同志淡化、削弱党的领导的错误是不满意的，是有抵制的。
    江泽民指出，政治体制改革要有利于加强和改善党的领导。政治体制改革的目的在于加强和改善党的领导，决不是淡化和削弱党的领导，更不是取消党的领导。他说，党的领导主要体现在：要制定和执行一条正确的政治路线。党的十一届三中全会以来的路线是正确的，一定要全面坚持一个中心、两个基本点。要充分发挥各级党组织的政治核心作用，党是一个按民主集中制原则组织起来的统一整体，否认基层党组织的作用，必然削弱党的领导。要按照“四化”方针和德才兼备原则，建设好各级领导班子和干部队伍。邓小平同志说，党要管党，一管党员，二管干部。党管干部的原则要坚持，方法要改进。要发挥共产党员在群众中的先锋模范作用。党是工人阶级的先锋队，加强党的领导，必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。
    江泽民说，我们要抓住当前有利时机，认真搞好学习，搞好党的建设，搞好干部考察工作。江泽民强调，必须严惩腐败分子，密切党和群众的关系。他说，党内腐败现象的蔓延，严重破坏党和群众的关系，是国内外敌对势力颠覆党的领导和社会主义制度的借口。党同人民群众的血肉联系是党的力量所在。只要我们始终代表人民群众的利益，我们党就经得起任何风浪的考验，就会永远立于不败之地。
    他说，反腐败斗争是关系到党的生死存亡的问题。中央决心把反腐败斗争进行到底。只要是触犯了党纪国法的案件，不管涉及到谁，都要一查到底；对已成风的腐败现象，不管涉及多少人，都要坚决制止。所有违纪违法案件，该怎么处理就怎么处理。从中央开始，要大力发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，切切实实办一些群众关心的实事，要防止形式主义，不搞一阵风。要建立能有效约束滥用权力的制度，加强对各级干部的监督和检查。
    江泽民说，必须把思想建设放在党的建设的突出位置上。当前，要用十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志的重要讲话统一全党思想。他说，反对资产阶级自由化的斗争要长期坚持下去。这种斗争要同增强党性的教育结合起来。要把被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想，包括在党的思想理论建设上造成的混乱，一一纠正过来。
    江泽民说，民主集中制是我们党几十年形成的好制度、好传统。正如李鹏同志刚才所说，少数服从多数，个人服从组织，下级服从上级，全党服从中央，这是今后在党建工作中必须强调的原则。还要教育党员眼前利益服从长远利益，个人利益服从国家利益，局部利益服从全局利益。要教育全党和人民群众发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，埋头苦干过几年紧日子，把治理整顿工作搞好。
    他说，青年是我们的未来，我们要十分重视对青年人的思想教育工作，要有一种责任感，加强工作、主动工作，用无产阶级思想教育青年一代。
    江泽民说，要提倡积极的党内思想斗争。认真开展批评与自我批评，用正确的思想克服错误的思想，分清是非，统一认识，增强团结。要提高党员特别是领导干部的马克思主义理论素质，要认真学习马克思主义哲学和政治经济学，要用马列主义的立场、观点、方法来观察和处理问题。
    乔石就当前党的建设要围绕一个中心两个基本点的基本路线来进行和加强领导班子建设等问题讲了话。李瑞环在会上就反腐败和国庆40周年的宣传问题讲了话。
