Shandong Develops Yellow River Water Resources

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on August 28, (correspondent Sī Yìmín) the Yellow River regions of Shandong Province are actively developing and utilizing the water resources of the Yellow River, promoting irrigation, conducting siltation improvement of soil, and providing water for urban production and living needs. By the end of July, the province's Yellow River irrigation area had reached 25 million mu, and 2.4 million mu of land had been improved through siltation.

In the past decade, the state has invested more than 100 million yuan to build and renovate a number of Yellow River irrigation projects, developing 62 irrigation districts of more than 100,000 mu each, including 5 large irrigation districts of more than 1 million mu. There are 49 counties (cities, districts) along the Yellow River that benefit greatly from Yellow River irrigation. In 1988, the water diversion reached 8.7 billion cubic meters, setting a historical record. From January to July this year, 7.4 billion cubic meters of water have been diverted, an increase of 2 billion cubic meters compared to the same period last year.

Yellow River irrigation has injected vitality into the agricultural production of the drought-stricken Yellow River regions of Shandong, effectively promoting significant increases in grain and cotton yields in the irrigation areas.

    山东开发黄河水资源
    据新华社济南8月28日电　（通讯员司毅民）山东省沿黄地区积极开发利用黄河水资源，发展引黄灌溉，进行放淤改土，供给城市生产和生活用水。截至7月底，全省引黄灌溉面积已达2500万亩，放淤改土240万亩。
    近10年来，国家先后投资1亿多元，新建、改建了一批引黄工程，发展了1万亩以上引黄灌区62处，其中100万亩以上的大型灌区5处，沿黄有49个县（市、区）深受黄河灌溉之利。1988年引水量达到87亿立方米，创历史最高纪录。今年1至7月份已引水74亿立方米，比去年同期多引水20亿立方米。
    引黄灌溉给备受干旱之苦的山东沿黄地区农业生产注入了生机，有力地促进了灌区粮棉大幅度增产。
