Edition: 8

A scholar of Chinese descent residing overseas has delved deeply into classical Chinese poetry and lyrics in the cultural milieu of the West, offering unique insights that are both captivating and thought-provoking. Last year, this female scholar returned to her homeland and delivered lectures in Beijing, attracting unprecedented attention. However, those who had the fortune to listen to Professor Leaf's lectures in person were few. Fortunately, Professor Leaf's series of lecture notes have been compiled and published by Yuelu Publishing House under the title "Seventeen Lectures on Tang and Song Ci," providing a feast for those who love Chinese classics.

Upon reviewing the entire book, it is not difficult to discover Professor Leaf's unique perspective: she places traditional Tang and Song lyrics within the context of modern world culture, integrating ancient and modern, East and West, thereby revealing insights that others cannot, making the reader's eyes and ears open wide. Notably, she employs modern Western philosophical and aesthetic concepts and categories to analyze Tang and Song lyricists and their works, delving into the subtle and profound, which is one of her major characteristics.

Tragedy, as a clear aesthetic concept, has been a staple of Western culture since ancient Greece, but it is not a part of traditional Chinese culture. However, tragedy itself is a shared human experience. Professor Leaf introduces this concept into her analysis of Tang and Song lyricists, thus forging a unique path. For example, she believes that the lyrics of the Five Dynasties' Southern Tang poet Fan Yan are the most imbued with tragic spirit. During the reign of Li Jing, the middle ruler of Southern Tang, Fan held the position of prime minister. The gloomy atmosphere of the inevitable fall of Southern Tang shrouded his future, pressing heavily on his heart. "Not avoiding the mirror's reflection of a thin face," knowing that his "beautiful face" was already thin, he still "not avoided" looking at it in the mirror. This persistence in pain, struggle in difficulty, and awareness and unwillingness to fail before tragedy, truly leaves a deep impression.

Rationality and sensibility, subjectivity and objectivity, these pairs of categories are not originally part of traditional Chinese culture, but Professor Leaf uses them to distinguish the styles of lyricists, which is also very appropriate. For example, Professor Leaf believes that although lyricists are mostly sensuous, Yan Shu is extremely rational. He has a kind of restraint, self-reflection, and control over his emotions, which is rationality. Therefore, his lyrics are written in a leisurely, relaxed, and unforced manner, with a sense of sadness and worry, but also with a clear rational awareness that can dispel sorrow. Therefore, his lyrics are rich in emotional appeal and have the strongest impact on people. Again, Professor Leaf refers to Wen Tingyun as an objective lyricist and Wei Zhuang as a subjective lyricist, and the contrast between the two is very striking. Wen uses the association of beauty and language codes to deepen the meaning of the lyrics, and he is calm and objective when writing about the beauty of women; Wei, on the other hand, with his straightforward and sincere emotions, and the strength of his tone, directly moves the reader, and his subjective emotions are very obvious. The difference between the two lies here.

Professor Leaf also uses modern Western literary criticism theories and methods to re-examine traditional poetry and lyrics, and this feature is the most prominent. She often casually mentions these theories, speaking freely, and often comes up with new ideas, making one clap in admiration. Let me give an example: the Qing scholar Zhang Huisheng, in his "Ci Selection," comments on Wen Tingyun's "Pusa Man" saying: "'Reflecting on the flowers' four sentences, the meaning of the initial service in 'Li Sao'." This statement is hard to convince. Because Wen is known for being "thin on action, without restraint," how can such a person yearn for beauty and purity like Qu Yuan? How can he be as loyal and affectionate to the country and the ruler as Qu Yuan? However, Professor Leaf highly appreciates Zhang Huisheng's view, using Western hermeneutic theory to prove the rationality of this view. Professor Leaf also cites Wang Guowei's "Those who achieve great undertakings and great scholarship, all go through three kinds of realms" as evidence; since Wang Guowei can understand the three realms that the authors did not necessarily intend to express from the lyrics of Yan Shu, Ouyang Xiu, and Qin Kedi, then why can't people taste a pursuit of beauty like Qu Yuan from Wen's lyrics? The late Qing scholar Tan Xian said it most clearly in the preface to his "Futang Ci Lu": "The author's intention may not be so, but the reader's intention can be so."

In a broad cultural and historical context, Professor Leaf analyzes and explains the lyrics and works of 16 Tang and Song lyricists one by one, discussing them in detail and speaking eloquently, painting for us 16 vivid and distinctive pictures, and clearly outlining the history of Tang and Song lyrics and the process of lyricization of poetry. Reading Professor Leaf's book, you may not agree with some of her views, but you will definitely gain many new insights from her book.

    古今中西　融会贯通
    ——读叶嘉莹《唐宋词十七讲》
    宇凡
    一位侨居大洋彼岸的华裔学者，在西方文化的氛围里潜心研读中国古典诗词，其独到之识，自有一番引人入胜之趣。去年，这位女学者回归故里，在京传道授业，盛况空前。然而，有亲耳聆听叶先生讲座之幸者，终是少数。可喜叶先生系列讲座讲稿经整理后交岳麓书社出版，名《唐宋词十七讲》，是可飨爱好国学诸君。
    纵观全书，不难发现叶先生独到之处，就在于她把传统的唐宋词置于世界文化的现代座标之上观照与把握，古今中西，无不融会贯通，从而道出他人所不能道者，令人耳目一新。其中，运用西方的现代的哲学、美学观念与范畴来分析唐宋词人及其作品，以探幽发微，可谓叶先生一大特点。
    悲剧作为一个明确的美学观念，自古希腊以来一直是西方文化的专利，中国传统文化无此一说。然而，悲剧本身却是人类共有的，叶先生将此观念引入了对唐宋词人的分析，也就蹊径独辟。如她认为五代南唐冯延已的词就是最具悲剧精神的，南唐中主李璟在位时冯官至宰相，南唐必亡的悲凉浓雾笼罩了他的前途，进而沉沉地压到了他的心底。“不辞镜里朱颜瘦”，明知“朱颜”已瘦，他还“不辞”地从镜里照看，这种在痛苦中执著，在艰难中挣扎，在失败前的自觉与不甘心的悲剧意识与悲剧精神，真令人刻骨铭心。
    理性与感性、主观与客观，这两对范畴也本不为中国传统文化所有，而叶先生运用它们来区分词人的风格，也是恰到好处。例如，叶先生认为，词人虽多是感性的，而晏殊却是极理性的。他对自己的感情有一种节制、反省和把握，这就是理性，因而他的词写得闲淡、悠然、不着力，有伤感、忧愁，又有清醒的理智，能排解忧伤。因而他的词富有感发的力量，对人的冲击力是最强的。又如，叶先生把温庭筠称作客观词人，把韦庄称作主观词人，两人对比便极鲜明了。温用美感和语码的联想加深了词的意境，他在写美人的香艳时是冷静客观的；韦则以他感情的直率真挚，以他口吻的那种劲节直接感动读者，他的主观感情是极明显的。两人区别即在此。
    用现代的眼光去反观传统诗词，叶先生还运用了西方一些新的文学批评理论和方法，这一特点显得最为突出。对此她常常是信手拈来，随意而谈，而往往新意迭出，令人击掌称叹，试举一例为证：清人张惠言《词选》评温庭筠《菩萨蛮》称：“‘照花’四句，《离骚》初服之意。”这话总难令人信服。因为温一向以“薄于行，无检幅”著称，这种人，怎么会像屈子那般向往美好高洁（初服）？怎么会像屈子那般对国对君忠爱缠绵？然而叶先生却很赞赏张惠言的看法，她用西方阐释学的理论来证明这种看法的合理性，叶先生还举了王国维的“成大事业、大学问者，罔不经过三种之境界”为证；既然王国维能从晏殊、欧阳修、辛弃疾的词中领会出作者本来未必要表现的三种境界，那么，人们为什么不能从温词里体味到一种有如屈子那般的追求美好之情呢？清末的谭献在其《复堂词录序》里把话说得再浅显明白不过了：“作者之用心未必然，读者之用心何必不然？”
    在一个广阔的文化历史背景下，叶先生对唐宋16个词人及其作品逐一分析讲解，细细论述，侃侃道来，为我们描绘出16幅色彩鲜明、各具特色的画面，为我们清晰地勾勒出了唐宋词的发展史及词的诗化过程。读叶先生的书，对她的一些观点你可以不与苟同，但你一定会从她的书中得到许多新的启示。
