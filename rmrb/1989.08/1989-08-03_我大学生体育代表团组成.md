The Chinese university student sports delegation to participate in the 15th World University Games has recently been formed in Beijing.

This delegation, consisting of 106 people, is the largest team China has sent to participate in international sports competitions this year. The delegation leader is Liu Xing, Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, and the deputy leader is Yu Chenkui. Among the 70 male and female athletes, most are outstanding members of the national training team, and many participated in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The track and field team includes Huang Zhi Hong, Jin Ling, Hou Xue Mei, and Xiong Qi Ying, who have set Asian records. The rowing team includes Zhou Shou Ying and Hu Ya Dong, who won medals in the Olympics. The fencing team includes Sun Hong Yun and Xiao Ai Hua. The 12 members of the Chinese men's basketball team are Sun Feng Wu, Zhang Yong Jun, A Di Jiang, Wang Fei, Song Li Gang, Bai Jiang, Chen Zheng Hao, Zhang Tao, Ma Jian, Gong Xiao Bin, Wang Zhi Dan, and Dan Tao.

The World University Games began in 1959 and are held every two years. Due to the impact of the venue change, this year's games will have only 66 countries with nearly 2,000 athletes participating, featuring only four events: track and field, rowing, fencing, and men's basketball. The competition will be held from August 22 to 30 in Duisburg, West Germany.

    我大学生体育代表团组成
    本报北京8月3日讯　记者汪大昭报道：参加第15届世界大学生运动会的中国大学生体育代表团最近在京组成。
    这个由106人组成的代表团是我国今年派出参加国际体育比赛最庞大的队伍，团长是全国体总秘书长刘兴，副团长是于宸奎。70名男女运动员大部分是国家集训队的优秀选手，许多人曾参加过去年汉城奥运会。田径队中有曾创造亚洲纪录的黄志红、金玲、侯雪梅、熊其英等，赛艇队中有奥运会奖牌获得者周守英、胡亚东等，击剑队中有孙洪云、肖爱华等名将。中国男篮的12名队员是孙凤武、张勇军、阿的江、王非、宋力刚、白江、陈正昊、张涛、马健、巩晓彬、王志丹和单涛。
    世界大学生运动会始办于1959年，每两年一届。今年的运动会因受易址影响，仅有66个国家近2000名选手参加，只设田径、赛艇、击剑和男篮四个项目。比赛将于8月22日至30日在联邦德国杜伊斯堡举行。
