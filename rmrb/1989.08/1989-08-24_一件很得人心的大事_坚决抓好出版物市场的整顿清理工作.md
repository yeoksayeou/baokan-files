The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council held a telephone conference, calling on all levels of party committees and governments across the country to further mobilize, strengthen leadership, strictly implement policies, carefully organize, and concentrate efforts to conduct a comprehensive rectification and cleanup of the book, newspaper, magazine, and audio-visual markets before National Day. This is a practical step to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, as well as to oppose various "spiritual poisons" and "cultural garbage" in the publishing field. It is a highly popular major event.

In recent years, our book, newspaper, magazine, and audio-visual markets have been severely out of control. Many illegal, reactionary, politically erroneous, and obscene, violent, and superstitious publications and audio-visual products have flooded the market. In particular, some pornographic and obscene publications have polluted social customs, harmed young people, and caused serious harm, leading some people to commit crimes. Faced with these shocking facts, teachers are calling out, parents are calling out, and the entire society and the broad masses of the people are calling out: We must not allow these "spiritual opium" and "yellow currents" to spread their poison. It is time to completely eliminate them!

This rectification and cleanup of the book, newspaper, magazine, and audio-visual markets includes banning reactionary political books that advocate bourgeois liberalization and cleaning up and shutting down various publications that promote obscenity, violence, and superstition, commonly known as "anti-pornography." In the ideological front and cultural field, some people have gained fame by daring to criticize the Communist Party and socialism. They advocate "bravery in breaking through" and "daring to sing the opposite tune," peddling reactionary works. These reactionary works deceive the public, stir up trouble, and create chaos in thought and politics. They must be banned. However, the current focus of the rectification and cleanup is "anti-pornography," which is also an important part of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. Some of these "yellow" publications are displayed on street bookstalls, sold by underground book peddlers, or even published by state-owned publishers, printed by state-owned printing houses, and sold by state-owned bookstores. Some books, magazines, and audio-visual products should not appear in our socialist China, and even in some Western countries, they are not allowed. The chaotic situation in our publication market must be quickly reversed, and then the source of pollution must be addressed by rectifying the publishing units. Otherwise, the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization will be greatly harmed.

Rectifying and cleaning up the book, newspaper, magazine, and audio-visual product markets is an important political task for the entire Party and society. Local party and government leadership organs, especially the propaganda, public security, cultural, radio and television, industrial and commercial, news and publication, and customs departments, must work together to comprehensively manage the situation. It is impossible to thoroughly solve the problem by relying on a single department or region. The attitude towards rectification and cleanup must be resolute. Some individuals and units are not afraid of fines and repeatedly violate the rules without reform. Such individuals and units must be made to understand the severity of party discipline and state law. Against various illegal and criminal behaviors, we must fully use legal weapons to fight resolutely. Of course, during the rectification and cleanup, we must strictly implement policies, carefully examine, and avoid indiscriminate sweeping.

During the rectification and cleanup, we must pay attention to protecting and supporting healthy and good publications. Our rectification and cleanup of the publication market is not to suppress the publishing and cultural industries. On the contrary, our policy is to flourish socialist literary and artistic creation, flourish the socialist publishing industry, enrich the cultural life of the people, and provide the people with progressive, healthy, and inspiring spiritual nourishment. With the progress of society and the development of socialist causes, the people's demand for spiritual civilization is increasingly high. The decayed must be opposed, and the outdated must be innovated. After a serious rectification and cleanup, the publishing front will surely be as beautiful as a garden in full bloom.

    一件很得人心的大事
    ——坚决抓好出版物市场的整顿清理工作
    本报评论员
    党中央、国务院召开电话会议，号召全国各级党委和政府进一步动员起来，加强领导，严格执行政策，精心组织，集中力量在国庆节前对书报刊和音像市场进行一次全面的整顿清理。这是在出版领域坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化，反对各种“精神毒品”、“文化垃圾”的一个实际步骤，是一件很得人心的大事。
    近几年来，我们的书报刊及音像市场严重失控。不少非法的、反动的、有严重政治错误的、宣扬色情、暴力和封建迷信的出版物和音像制品泛滥成灾，特别是一些淫秽、色情书刊污染社会风气，毒害青少年，为害甚烈，致使有些人因此走向犯罪的道路。面对这些触目惊心的事实，教师在疾呼，家长在疾呼，整个社会和广大人民群众都在疾呼：决不能再听任这些“精神鸦片”、“黄色浊流”流毒四方，是到了彻底清除它们的时候了！
    这次整顿清理书报刊和音像市场，包括查禁宣扬资产阶级自由化的反动政治书籍，也包括清查和取缔各种宣传淫秽、色情、暴力和封建迷信的出版物，即通常所说的“扫黄”。在意识形态阵地，在文化领域，就有些人以敢骂共产党、敢骂社会主义而走红，他们标榜“勇于突破”、“敢唱反调”，大肆兜售反动作品。这些反动作品欺世惑众，煽风点火，在思想上、政治上制造了混乱，一定要查禁。但目前整顿清理的重点是“扫黄”，这也是反对资产阶级自由化斗争的一个重要组成部分。这些“黄色”出版物，有的在街头书摊摆放，有的在“地下”书贩手中倒卖，有的竟然是国营出版社出版、国营印刷厂印刷、国营书店销售的。有些书报刊和音像制品，别说在我们社会主义中国不应该出现，即使在一些西方国家，也是不允许出现的。我们的出版物市场的混乱状况必须迅速扭转，进而还要解决污染源问题，把出版单位整顿好。否则，建设社会主义物质文明和精神文明就会受到极大危害。
    整顿清理书报刊及音像制品市场，是全党和全社会的一项重要政治任务。各地党政领导机关，特别是宣传、公安、文艺、广播影视、工商、新闻出版、海关等部门要协同作战，综合治理。单靠某一个部门、某一个地区整顿清查是无法彻底解决问题的。清理整顿的态度要坚决。有些人和单位，罚款他不怕，一而再，再而三，屡教不改，对这样的人和单位，要使他们知道党纪国法的厉害。对形形色色的违法犯罪行为，要充分运用法律武器进行坚决的斗争。当然，在整顿清理过程中要严格执行政策，要看准了再搞，切忌不分青红皂白横扫一气。
    在整顿清理中，要注意保护和扶持健康的、好的出版物。我们整顿清理出版物市场决不是为了打击出版事业和文艺事业。相反地，我们的方针是要繁荣社会主义文艺创作，繁荣社会主义出版事业，活跃人民群众的文化生活，给人民群众提供进步、健康、激人奋进的精神食粮。随着社会的进步，社会主义事业的发展，人民群众对精神文明的要求越来越高，腐朽的要反对，陈旧的要创新，经过认真整顿清理后的出版阵地必将繁花似锦，春色满园。
