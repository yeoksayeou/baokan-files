The opening ceremony of this year's World University Games featured hundreds of students forming a "big ship," vividly depicting the theme of "rowing together in the same boat," leaving a deep impression. During the closing ceremony, this "big ship" will "fly" from the water to the sky.

It is reported that the closing ceremony of this year's World University Games will follow the final track and field event. At that time, athletes from various countries will gather again in the stadium. A choir of 400 people will, under the leadership of a famous singer, enthusiastically perform a grand chorus.

If the weather is good, two airships will carry the flags of the World University Games and rise from the stadium, symbolically flying towards the host city of the next World University Games, Sheffield. The organizers arranged this segment to indicate that this year's World University Games have been successfully concluded in Duisburg, but the theme of "rowing together in the same boat" will continue forever.

The Amusing and Annoying "Penguins"

After the full-scale start of this year's World University Games, vehicles around the Duisburg Weda Sports Park were congested, and three large "penguins" further caused traffic chaos.

The three "penguins" wanted to cross the road. The leader stood in the middle of the road, blowing a whistle to stop the vehicles. Suddenly, the "penguins" had a whim to board a public bus to have a look. The driver, smiling, opened the door, and the "penguins" one by one "jumped" onto the bus. Perhaps they did not find anything new, the "penguins" one by one "jumped" off the bus and "walked" across the road. The leader blew the whistle again, signaling the vehicles to pass.

The "penguins" made the spectators burst into laughter, and even the police on horseback forgot their duties and laughed heartily.

The World University Games is a grand gathering of young people from around the world, and it indeed needs a relaxed atmosphere.

    世界大学生运动会花絮
    从水中到天上
    本届大学生运动会开幕式数百名学生围成的一条“大船”，表现的“同舟共济”的主题给人留下了深刻印象。闭幕式上，这条“大船”将由水中“飞”到天上。
    据悉，本届大学生运动会闭幕式将紧接着最后一项田径项目举行。届时，各国运动员将再次在体育场相聚。四百人的合唱团将在著名歌星的带领下盛情的大合唱。
    如果天气好的话，两条飞艇将挂着大学生运动会会旗，从体育场升起，象征性地飞向下届大学生运动会的主办地谢菲尔德。组织者安排这一节目，是为了说明，本届大学生运动会已在杜伊斯堡圆满结束，但“同舟共济”的主题思想将永远继续。
    可笑又可恼的“企鹅”
    本届大学生运动会全面“开战”后，杜伊斯堡韦道体育公园周围车辆拥挤，而三只大“企鹅”更使交通陷入混乱。
    三只“企鹅”要过马路，领头的站到马路中间，吹着哨子，拦住路上的车辆。突然，“企鹅”又心血来潮，想上公共汽车参观参观。司机笑着打开车门，“企鹅”一个接着一个“跳”上汽车，可能是没有发现什么新鲜东西，“企鹅”又一个接着一个“跳”下汽车，“走”过马路。领头的又吹响哨子，示意汽车通过。
    “企鹅”们引得观众开怀大笑，骑着高头大马的警察也忘了执行“任务”，在一旁乐开了花。
    大学生运动会是世界各国青年人的大聚会，本来就需要一种轻松的气氛。
