Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 17th.

Egypt and the United States signed an agreement today, partially thawing the $2.1 billion in aid that the U.S. had frozen for Egypt in 1988. The agreement stipulates that $115 million will be paid to Egypt in cash.

The U.S. had originally agreed to provide Egypt with $2.1 billion in aid for the 1988 fiscal year, intended to support the development of Egypt's private sector and to fund imports. However, the U.S. later decided that Egypt had not taken sufficient measures in its economic reforms, leading to the freezing of the entire aid package for over a year.

Following Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's visit to the U.S. in April and discussions with American leaders, the U.S. agreed to partially thaw the 1988 aid. It is expected that the remaining portion of the 1989 aid will be paid to Egypt before the end of the U.S. 1989 fiscal year on September 30.

    美对埃及援助部分解冻
    新华社开罗8月17日电　埃及和美国今天签署了一项协议，美国将其冻结的1988年向埃及提供21亿美元援助部分解冻，支付给埃及1.15亿美元的现款。
    美国曾同意在1988财政年度向埃及提供21亿美元的援助，用以发展埃及的私营企业和资助进口。但是，美国后来认为埃及未能认真地在经济改革中采取措施，而将这笔援助全部冻结了一年多。
    今年4月埃及总统穆巴拉克访问美同美国领导人会谈后，美国同意将1988年的援助解冻，并将在今年9月31日美国1989财政年度结束前支付给埃及的1989年部分援助。
