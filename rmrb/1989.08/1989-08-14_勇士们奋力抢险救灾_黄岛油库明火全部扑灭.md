    Brave Fighters Strive to Rescue and Disaster Relief
    Yellow Island Oil Depot's Open Flames Extinguished

    Our reporter in Qingdao, August 14th—At 19:40 this evening, the last remaining open flame at the Yellow Island Oil Depot, the fire at Tank 3, was extinguished. Thus, the raging inferno that had burned for nearly 60 hours was finally brought under control.

    The leaders of the on-site fire-fighting command center reported that the strong southeast winds could at any moment cause the embers to reignite, making the situation still very severe. Hundreds of fire trucks are on standby, and hundreds of firefighters are still working tirelessly to extinguish the remaining fires in the oil tanks.

    Around 2:00 PM today, a sudden shift in wind direction from north to south blew the 30-meter-high flames from Tank 3 towards the new oil storage area, creating a highly dangerous situation. At 16:40, the decisive battle to extinguish the flames from Tank 3 began. Over 400 firefighters braved the intense heat and suffocating smoke to approach Tank 3. More than 50 fire trucks in three batches sprayed over a hundred tons of mixed foam. By around 19:00, the flames that had once reached 300 meters high had been reduced to mere wisps of smoke. However, there were still several spots of residual fire within the burning tank area. The firefighters were making their final push.

    The Yellow Island Oil Depot, which was struck by lightning and exploded, causing a fire, has been brought under control through the relentless efforts of the Party, government, military, and civilians who have been fighting day and night. The raging flames have been contained, thus initially securing the wharf, oil area, power plant, and 140,000 tons of crude oil and refined oil.

    The Yellow Island Oil Port, located 4 nautical miles from Qingdao City, is an important crude oil export wharf in China. Crude oil from the Shengli Oilfield is transported here via pipelines for storage and export. After the fire broke out at 12:00 PM on the 12th, the Party, government, military, and civilians of Shandong Province, under the care and support of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, have been fully committed to the fire-fighting and rescue efforts. The Shandong Province established a fire-fighting command center, which has been directing operations around the clock, following Premier Li Peng's instruction to "definitely protect the Yellow Island Oil Port." Nearly a hundred fire trucks have been mobilized from all directions to the frontline of the fire-fighting efforts. Over 100 tons of fire-fighting agents have been rushed to the fire zone at night. The Jinan Military Region and others dispatched aircraft and warships to transport supplies and rescue injured personnel from the air and sea, and to engage in emergency fire-fighting. Medical teams organized by the health departments have been saving injured personnel day and night. Various departments under the provincial government and large enterprises have transported fire-fighting equipment and urgently needed supplies to the scene.

    In the fight against the fire, the Party, government, military, and civilians of Shandong Province have also paid a heavy price. This fire has rendered 5 oil tanks unusable, burned 40,000 tons of crude oil, destroyed more than a dozen fire trucks, injured over 70 people, and resulted in at least 16 deaths.

    勇士们奋力抢险救灾
    黄岛油库明火全部扑灭
    本报青岛8月14日电　今晚19点40分，黄岛油库火灾的最后一股明火——3号罐火焰被扑灭。至此，燃烧了近60个小时的熊熊烈火，终于被稳定控制。
    在现场的灭火指挥部领导同志介绍说，强劲的东南风随时都可能导致死灰复燃，形势仍很严峻，上百辆消防车正严阵以待，数百名消防干警仍在奋力扑灭油罐残余火点。
    今天下午2点左右，突然由北转南的强风，把3号罐30多米高的火舌吹向储油的新罐区，情形万分危险。16时40分，扑灭3号罐烈火的攻坚战打响，400多名灭火勇士，冒着炽热火焰和令人窒息的浓烟，逼近3号罐，50多辆消防车分3批喷射了上百吨混合泡沫，到19点左右，曾一度高达300米的火焰，已化作有气无力的余烟，但在起火罐区内，仍有多处余火。消防干警在做最后拚搏。

    本报济南8月14日电　遭雷击爆炸起火的山东省黄岛油库，经党政军民奋不顾身地昼夜扑救，熊熊的火势得到遏制，从而初步保住了码头、油区、电厂以及14万吨原油、成品油。
    与青岛市区相隔4海里的黄岛油港，是我国重要的原油出口码头。来自胜利油田的原油通过输油管线送到这里储存外运。12日上午火灾发生后，山东省党政军民在党中央、国务院的关怀支持下，全力以赴地投入了灭火抢险的战斗。山东省成立灭火指挥部，昼夜坐阵指挥，遵照李鹏总理“一定要保住黄岛油港”的要求，从四面八方调集到灭火前线的消防车有近百辆，星夜运往火区的灭火药剂有100多吨，济南军区等派出飞机、军舰从空中和海上抢运物资、救伤员，突击灭火；卫生部门组织的医疗队伍日夜抢救伤员；省直有关部门和各大企业都把灭火器械和急用物资运到了现场。
    山东省党政军民在灭火斗争中也付出了巨大的代价。这场火灾使5个油罐报废，4万吨原油烧掉，十多辆消防车焚毁，70余人受伤，至少有16人死亡。
