Every month, publicly posting accounts of banquets and entertainment, listing the guests, accompanying personnel, and expenses for public scrutiny, is a new measure adopted by the Sixian Region in Anhui Province to strictly control the stubborn problem of excessive banquets and entertainment.

Sixian Region is a poverty-stricken old revolutionary base area, with an average annual income of less than 300 yuan per person. However, the problem of excessive banquets and entertainment is also very serious here and has been difficult to eliminate. The regional grain bureau spent 21,219 yuan on entertainment in the first five months of this year alone. Some local people are indignant, saying, "A public banquet is a year's grain for a peasant family." The variety of reasons for banquets is astonishing. According to reports from places like Houchou County and Shidian District, various teams such as family planning inspection teams, contract settlement teams, illegal construction demolition teams, cotton planting supervision teams, energy-saving teams, service teams for plucking live feathers from geese, ID photo teams, and agricultural bank loan evaluation teams all come down to be entertained.

The Sixian Regional Party Committee and Administrative Office have stipulated that starting this month, each unit must publicly post their accounts of banquets and entertainment every month, listing the guests and accompanying personnel by name, as well as the expenses incurred, for public scrutiny and supervision by higher authorities. Every quarter, the discipline inspection and supervision departments will report on the situation of banquets and entertainment from the township to the district, from the district to the county, and from the county to the region. Those found violating regulations to engage in banquets and entertainment will be publicly criticized the first time, have their names published in the "Wanxi Daily" the second time, and face disciplinary action the third time.

The Regional Party Committee also encourages the public to expose those who engage in banquets and entertainment. If a leading cadre is reported by the public for violating regulations to engage in banquets and entertainment, one month's salary will be deducted, and the informant will be rewarded 50 to 100 yuan.

    六安地区治顽症有良方
    张榜公布吃喝招待帐
    据新华社合肥8月10日电　（记者郭庆华）每月张榜公布吃喝招待账，把招待对象、陪客人员、开支金额全部向群众公布，这是安徽省六安地区在狠治吃喝顽症中采取的一项新措施。
    六安地区是贫困老区，全区人均收入还不到300元。但这里的吃喝风同样十分严重，而且屡禁不绝。地区粮食局今年头5个月就用去招待费21219元。有的群众气愤地说：“公家一席宴，农家一年粮”。吃喝名目之多令人咋舌。据霍丘县石店区等地反映，什么计划生育验收队、合同兑现清帐队、违章建筑拆迁队、抢种棉花督战队、节约能源捣灶队、活拔鹅毛服务队、颁发身份证照相队、农行贷款评估队等各种人员都下来吃请。
    六安地委和行署规定，从本月起，每个单位每个月都要公布一次吃喝招待帐，把招待对象和陪客的姓名以及开支多少公之于众，接受群众监督和上级检查。每一季度，纪检和监察部门由乡对区、区对县、县对地区，逐级汇报一次吃喝招待情况，发现违反规定搞吃喝的，第一次予以通报，第二次在《皖西报》上公布，第三次给予党纪政纪处分。
    地委还鼓励群众对搞吃喝者进行揭发，规定领导干部如被群众检举违反规定搞吃喝的，扣发一个月工资，对检举人员奖励50—100元。
