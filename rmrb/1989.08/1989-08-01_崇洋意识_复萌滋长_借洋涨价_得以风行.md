In Shanghai, goods labeled with English words are astonishingly expensive. Despite the fact that many of these items are clearly substandard or counterfeit, they still find buyers. Some insightful individuals have analyzed this peculiar phenomenon and concluded that the admiration for foreign goods is resurging, and price gouging using foreign names is becoming prevalent.

Today, Shanghai's market is filled with goods that have a foreign touch to their names. Although many of the "public and private" merchants have a limited understanding of the differences between Chinese Pinyin and English, this does not prevent them from using awkward handwriting and crude printing techniques to replicate "imported goods."

A simple 32-piece set of undershirts, once labeled with crooked English words like "Summer Shirt" or "GOOD-BYE," can see its price jump from the ten-yuan range. A pair of fake "Nike" travel shoes, marked with the "NIKE" logo, can sell for half a month's salary of a university assistant professor.

The trend of "inflating prices with a foreign name" is spreading in Shanghai's bustling streets and remote stalls. A stroll down Nanjing Road or Huaihai Road reveals many goods with names that blend Chinese and Western elements. Cosmetics, clothing, beverages, shoes, socks, and more are all branded with foreign names. According to Li Changde, manager of the fashion department at Shanghai's Huiliang Department Store, many of the "foreign-brand" T-shirts priced at 300 yuan each and "imported-brand" suits priced at 1,000 to 2,000 yuan seen on Shanghai's streets are actually counterfeit goods from places like Fujian and Wenzhou. This practice of "hiding a dog's meat under a foreign label" can sell several sets a day, earning more than an ordinary person's annual salary in just a few days.

Many state-owned and collective enterprises are also involved in this practice. Some collective enterprises produce cosmetics with formulas that are essentially the same but with new foreign-sounding names, instantly elevating their status to that of "foreign goods."

Using foreign names to make money is not a new phenomenon. Before 1949, people in Shanghai used ordinary syrups and liquids to play the trick of "Aerobrain Tonic," claiming it was the latest Western medical discovery. Today, this old trick is being repeated, naturally stirring waves in the hearts of Shanghai residents. Those in their fifties, the "old Shanghai" crowd, generally do not pay much attention to foreign names. They say: We've seen enough foreign goods before; even matches and nails were once called foreign matches and foreign nails. Why be so superstitious? Many people are also quite disgusted, feeling that now, in everything we eat, wear, use, and see, foreign goods are everywhere, leading to many counterfeit foreign goods being sold at high prices, while genuine domestic goods are losing money year after year, which is unacceptable.

Those who value foreign names more are the young people in their twenties and thirties. Some young people, knowing full well that the high-priced travel shoes labeled "NIKE" are counterfeit, still reluctantly pay for them. In their eyes, a fake "NIKE" is at least a bit more foreign than a domestic brand like "Láng" travel shoes. Among young workers, there have been instances where people wore clothes, shoes, hats, and accessories labeled "MADE IN CHINA," thinking they were foreign goods, genuinely wanting to be fashionable. Unfortunately, they ended up spending money for nothing and even making a fool of themselves.

Some scholars in Shanghai's social, cultural, and economic circles point out: Indeed, we must explore the deep-seated cultural psychology behind this phenomenon. Shanghai was once known as the "Ten-Mile Foreign Settlement," making it easy for the admiration for foreign goods to resurge. Coupled with the growing market awareness, it inevitably leads to the motive of making money by inflating prices with foreign names.

### “崇洋意识”复萌滋长  “借洋涨价”得以风行

     在上海，写着英文字的“进口货”价格惊人。尽管不少明明是次品、假货，但不乏买主。一些有识之士分析这一奇怪现象时认为——
    “崇洋意识”复萌滋长  “借洋涨价”得以风行
    今日上海市场上，很有点“洋”味的货名时有所见。尽管众多的“公私”商人中，有不少对汉语拼音与英文之异同还不甚了了，但这并不妨碍他们用不伦不类的笔法和粗糙的印刷术，复制“进口货”。
    一件普普通通的32支汗衫，一旦印上歪歪扭扭的“夏四衫”、“GOOD—BY”等东西洋文，它的价格就在十元这个档次上翻起了跟斗。一双打着“NIKE”商标的假“耐克”旅游鞋，卖价可以是一个大学助教半个月的工资。
    “借个洋名涨”，这股歪风正在上海的繁华街市和偏僻地摊出现。逛一下南京路、淮海路，可以看到许多令人莫辨中西的货名，都是一个个常用翻译汉字的组合。化妆品、服装、饮料、皮鞋、袜子等等，无不打有“洋”旗号的。据上海华联商厦时装部经理李昶德介绍，目前上海街头许多店摊挂着的300元一件“外国名牌”T恤、一二千元一套的“进口名牌”西装，十之八九是从福建、温州等地倒来的假货。这种“挂‘洋’头卖狗肉”的营生，一天一般能卖掉几套，获利超过普通人一年半载的薪水。
    不少国营、集体企业也参与其事。一些集体企业生产的化妆品，配方“换汤不换药”，起个“爱”什么之类的名，就俨然“洋货”身价了。
    利用“洋名”发财，本不是新鲜事。1949年以前，上海就有人用普通的糖浆、液剂，玩过所谓西洋最新医学成果“艾罗补脑汁”的把戏。而今旧戏重演，自然在上海人心中激起阵阵涟漪：50开外的“老上海”大多对“洋名”不以为然。他们说：洋货以前看多了，火柴、铁钉还叫过洋火、洋钉呢，何必那么迷信。许多人还十分反感，认为现在吃、穿、用、看，到处洋货充斥，引得许多假洋货出笼，乱卖高价，货真价实的“国货”反倒连年亏本，太不像话。
    比较看重洋名的，是二三十岁的年轻人。一些年轻人明知标着“NIKE”的高价旅游鞋是冒牌货，也忍痛掏钱。在他们看来，假的“NIKE”比之国产名牌“狼牌”旅游鞋，多少“洋”上一点儿。青年职工中，曾经有人穿戴着“MADEINCHINA”字样的服装、鞋帽、包饰之类，以为“洋货”，真诚想“摩登”一下。可惜，花钱买个当上，还闹笑话。
    一些上海社会、文化、经济学界人士指出：确实要追寻这一现象背后的市民深层文化心理。上海旧称“十里洋场”，“迷洋意识”是极易复萌滋长的，加之市场意识也在滋长，必然引发“借洋名涨价”的发财动机。
