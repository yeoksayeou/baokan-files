Hangzhou to Host "Autumn by West Lake"

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 17th — As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, Hangzhou will launch the "Autumn by West Lake" special tourism project, welcoming visitors with the city's clear moon over the lake, golden flowers in full bloom, fragrant osmanthus in autumn, and vast autumn waves.

Along the main scenic areas around West Lake, a variety of nighttime activities will be arranged: "Moon over the Lake" and "Three Ponds Reflecting the Moon" are the best spots for moon viewing; boating on the lake allows one to experience the scene of "a vast West Lake under a single moon, as if one is already in the Palace of the Moon"; the "Lovers' Seat" is set up at the Snow Viewing Pavilion on Solitary Hill; the "Willow Wave Night Garden" offers Yue opera, light music, and thrilling performances like "flying cars and wall-walking"; climbing Mount Wu (Chenghuang Mountain) provides a panoramic view of the lights along both West Lake and the Qiantang River.

    杭州将办“西湖之秋”
    新华社杭州八月十七日电（记者纪静如）临近中秋，杭州将推出“西湖之秋”特色旅游项目，以杭州的一湖明月、满园黄花、三秋金桂和万里秋涛欢迎游客。
    沿西湖的主要景区，将安排丰富多彩的夜游活动：“平湖秋月”、“三潭印月”是赏月最佳处；湖中泛舟，可领略“百顷西湖一明月，此身已在广寒宫”的意境；孤山清雪庐设有“情侣雅座”；“柳浪夜花园”，则有越剧、轻音乐和“飞车走壁”等游乐活动；登上吴山（城隍山），西湖和钱江两岸灯火则一览无余。
