Since Jiangsu Province implemented the strategy of developing an export-oriented economy, it has achieved good results in areas such as export earnings, utilizing foreign capital, introducing technology, and expanding tourism. Many people ask: What are the effective methods to achieve these results? Jiangsu Province's experience is to rely on two forces: one is township enterprises, and the other is urban large and medium-sized enterprises. In Jiangsu, people regard township enterprises as the backbone of developing an export-oriented economy, and urban large and medium-sized enterprises as the main force. When these two forces combine, they form various forms of enterprise groups, which can take big steps towards the international market.

Jiangsu Province's township enterprises play an active role and have a unique position in external development. Jiangsu's township enterprises are the earliest to start, fastest to develop, largest in scale, and highest in level in the country. The total industrial output value of township enterprises has always accounted for about 1/5 of the national total. In 1988, the total industrial output value of the province reached 88.766 billion yuan. This scale not only far exceeds the total agricultural output value but has also begun to surpass the total industrial output value of state-owned enterprises. In the economically developed Suzhou area, township enterprises are highly concentrated. Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Zhangjiagang, and other counties and cities have output values that have successively exceeded four to five billion yuan, not inferior to some medium-sized cities along the coast and inland. These township industries adhere to the direction of serving agriculture, large industries, people's lives, and exports. In recent years, they have made significant progress in serving exports. Since 1985, the annual average growth rate of export commodity procurement has been over 50%, developing a number of foreign exchange-earning flagship products. There are 125 relatively large enterprises where the export value accounts for more than 70% of the sales value. In addition, they have started to engage in "processing and assembly," establish joint ventures and cooperative enterprises, introduce applicable advanced technologies, and undertake construction contracts overseas. In 1988, Wujin County had 127 enterprises mainly producing export commodities, with the total export commodity procurement value reaching 230 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 times over the previous year. Xihu Township in Yangzhou City, located in northern Jiangsu, also has 46 categories of approximately 1,000 products exported to Asia, Europe, America, and Australia in more than 30 countries and regions. Therefore, in Jiangsu, regarding township industries as the backbone of developing an export-oriented economy is in line with reality.

Of course, praising township enterprises does not mean belittling the role of large and medium-sized enterprises in developing an export-oriented economy. Jiangsu Province's total industrial output value has been at the top of the country for many years; 40 industries have 12 at the top and 7 in second place nationwide; 61 major industrial products have 12 at the top and 10 in second place nationwide. According to statistics from 1987, the province has 184 large enterprises and 593 medium-sized enterprises, with their output value accounting for about 32% of the total industrial output. Many of these large and medium-sized enterprises are key enterprises for export earnings. The main export commodities, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, silk, clothing, canned food, hardware tools, cement, minerals, and some household appliances, have a large part of their raw materials, components, and final products coming from large and medium-sized enterprises. In recent years, many Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises have also been based on or supported by large and medium-sized enterprises. It is clear that without large and medium-sized enterprises, Jiangsu Province would not have today's prosperous situation in developing an export-oriented economy.

However, whether it is township enterprises or large and medium-sized enterprises, they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Township enterprises have been able to develop and open up externally because, in addition to being mainly small enterprises with flexible and agile characteristics, known as "small boats can turn quickly," they are basically self-managed, self-profitable, and self-developing, independent commodity producers and operators, with strong internal vitality. However, they are still mainly small, generally "small but complete," "small but rough," and "small but scattered," with relatively backward equipment and relatively rough technology. On the other hand, large and medium-sized enterprises, although more advanced in equipment and technology, have not yet fully released their internal vitality before the enterprise system reform is well done. In this situation, relying solely on township enterprises often leads to various resources flowing back to traditional industries; at the same time, relying solely on large and medium-sized enterprises shows insufficient vitality and cannot adapt to the rapidly changing international market.

Given Jiangsu Province's situation, the available option is: continue to play the role of township enterprises as the backbone, but gradually improve it; at the same time, further play the role of large and medium-sized enterprises as the main force, and deepen the reform to promote opening up. More importantly, organize these two forces into enterprise groups and push them towards the international market. This is because the international market is different from the domestic market. Most commodities are buyer's markets, and competition is fierce. Only by cultivating a group of enterprise groups with strong competitiveness can we participate in international market competition. The essence of international market competition is scientific and technological competition. Enterprise groups can, through synchronized planning, development, transformation, and management, reorganize various production factors originally scattered in member enterprises according to external requirements, improve the degree of specialization; and integrate the advantages of trade, industry, and technology, forming an economic entity with high technological development, transformation, imitation, and innovation capabilities, turning technological advantages into export advantages. In recent years, township enterprises and large and medium-sized enterprises have formed enterprise groups and transformed from inward-looking to outward-looking, becoming a powerful force in Jiangsu Province's development of an export-oriented economy. Changzhou City, with famous brand products as the leader, large and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone, and suburban county township enterprises as members, formed enterprise groups. In 1987, four textile groups and four machinery and electrical groups created 132 million US dollars in foreign exchange, accounting for 65% of the city's total export earnings. Wuxi City's "Meihua" electronic enterprise group, with township enterprises supplying some components and large and medium-sized enterprises assembling and conducting research and design, developed seven generations of products in eight years, with the quantity and value of exports continuously expanding. Due to the backbone and main force forming outward-looking or mainly outward-looking enterprise groups, Jiangsu Province's export earnings and the utilization of foreign capital and introduction of technology have reached one new level after another!

    乡镇企业和城市大中型企业联合，参加国际市场竞争是——
    发展外向型经济的一个有效办法
    沈立人
    江苏省实施发展外向型经济的战略以来，在出口创汇、利用外资、引进技术和扩大旅游等方面都取得了良好成绩。常有人问：取得这些成绩，有什么好办法？江苏省的经验是：依靠两支力量——一支是乡镇企业，一支是城市大中型企业。在江苏，人们把乡镇企业看作发展外向型经济的生力军，把城市大型企业或大中型企业看作发展外向型经济的主力军。两支力量拧在一起，形成多种形式的企业集团，就能大踏步地走向国际市场。
    江苏省的乡镇企业在外向开拓方面有其积极作用和特殊地位。江苏省的乡镇企业在全国是起步最早、发展最快、规模最大、水平最高的，乡镇工业总产值一直占全国的1／5左右。1988年，全省乡镇工业总产值达到887.66亿元。这个规模，不仅大大超过了农业总产值，也开始超过全民所有制工业总产值。经济发达的苏南地区，乡镇企业高度密集，无锡、江阴、武进、张家港等县、市，产值先后突破四五十亿元，不亚于沿海和内地的某些中等城市。这些乡镇工业，坚持为农业、为大工业、为人民生活和为出口服务的方向，近几年，为出口服务更有较大的进展。1985年以来，出口商品收购额每年平均增长50％以上，发展了一批创汇的拳头产品，并有125个较大企业的出口额占销售额的70％以上。此外，开展“三来一补”，举办合资和合作企业，引进适用的先进技术，到海外从事建筑承包等，也已迈开了步子。1988年，吴江县有127个企业以生产出口商品为主，全县乡镇工业出口商品收购额达2.3亿元，比上年增长1.3倍。地处苏北扬州市的西湖乡，也有46类约1000种产品远销亚、欧、美、澳四大洲的30多个国家和地区。因此，在江苏，把乡镇工业看作发展外向型经济的生力军，是符合实际的。
    当然，赞扬乡镇企业，决不意味着贬低大中型企业在发展外向型经济中的主力军作用。江苏省的工业总产值已经连续多年居全国各省、市、自治区的首位；40个行业的产值，有12个居全国首位，7个居全国第二位；61种主要工业的产量，有12种居全国首位，10种居全国第二位。据1987年统计资料，全省共有大型企业184个和中型企业593个，其产值约占全部工业的32％。这些大中型企业，不少是出口创汇的骨干企业。出口的主要商品棉纱、棉布、丝绸、服装和罐头食品、五金工具、水泥、矿产以及某些家用电器，很大部分的原材料、零部件和最终产品来自大中型企业。近几年来的中外合资和合作企业，不少也以大中型企业为基础或后盾。可见，离开了大中型企业，江苏省发展外向型经济决不会有今天这样的兴旺局面。
    但是，无论乡镇企业或大中型企业，都既有它的优势，又有它的弱点。乡镇企业之所以能够蓬勃发展和外向开拓，除了它以小型企业为主、具有灵活机动的特点即所谓“船小好掉头”外，主要是它基本上自主经营、自负盈亏、自谋发展，是独立的商品生产经营者，具有较强的内在活力。但是，它毕竟不仅以小型为主，并且一般属于“小而全”、“小而粗”、“小而散”，设备比较落后，技术比较粗放。相反，大中型企业虽然在设备、技术上比较先进，但是在企业体制改革还未搞好以前，蕴藏在内部的活力还未能充分发挥出来。在上述情况下，如果只是依靠乡镇企业，往往限于劳动密集型产品，将导致各种资源向传统产业倒流；同时，如果只是依靠大中型企业，却显得活力不足，不能适应瞬息万变的国际市场。
    根据江苏省的这个情况，可供选择的出路是：继续发挥乡镇企业的生力军作用，但要逐步提高；同时，进一步发挥大中型企业的主力军作用，并要深化改革，以改革促开放。更重要的是把这两支力量组织起来，以企业集团的形式推向国际市场。这是因为，国际市场与国内市场不同，多数商品是买方市场，竞争十分剧烈。只有造就一批有强大竞争力的企业集团，才能参与国际市场的竞争。国际市场的竞争，实质上是科学技术的竞争。企业集团能够通过同步规划、同步开发、同步改造、同步管理，把原来分散在成员企业的各种生产要素按外向要求加以重新组合，提高专业化程度；并集贸、工、技各方优势于一身，形成拥有高技术开发、改造、模仿、创新能力的经济实体，把科技优势转化为出口优势。近几年来，乡镇企业与大中型企业组成企业集团并从内向转为外向，成为江苏省发展外向型经济的强大力量。常州市以名牌产品为龙头，以大中型企业为骨干，联合所属郊县的乡镇企业组成企业集团，四家纺织集团和四家机电集团1987年就创汇1.32亿美元，占全市出口创汇总额的65％。无锡市的“梅花”电子企业集团，由乡镇企业供应部分元器件，由大中型企业总装并开展科研、设计，录音机在八年内开发了七代产品25种，出口的数量和金额不断扩大。由于生力军与主力军组成外向型或以外向为主的企业集团，江苏省的出口创汇和利用外资、引进技术都登上了一个又一个的新台阶！
