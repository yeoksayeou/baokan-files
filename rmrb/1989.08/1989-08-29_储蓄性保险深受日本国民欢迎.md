In Japan, as a method of personal savings, bank deposits rank first, and insurance ranks second. According to statistics, by the end of June this year, the reserve funds for compensation payments by insurance companies, including property insurance and life insurance, amounted to approximately 130 trillion yen, surpassing the postal savings balance for the first time. The reasons are as follows:

First, Japanese citizens have strengthened their awareness of choosing high-interest rates. One-time premium payment retirement insurance, with its interest rates higher than those of bank and postal savings, is deeply popular among citizens.

Second, with the advent of an aging society, people use insurance as a means to arrange for their later years, thereby increasing personal savings channels.

Currently, insurance companies, backed by their substantial financial resources, have strengthened the comprehensive financial functions of their own companies. In this way, the competition among insurance companies, banks, and postal savings has further intensified. How banks and postal departments will attract national funds in the future has become an important research topic.

    储蓄性保险深受日本国民欢迎
    在日本，作为个人存款的方式，占第一位的是银行存款，占第二位的就是保险。据统计，截至今年6月末，包括财产保险、人寿保险在内的保险公司作为支付赔款的准备金余额约为130兆日元，首次超过邮局存款余额。其原因：
    一是日本国民选择高利率的意识增强，而一次支付保费的养老保险由于利率高于银行和邮政存款利率，深受国民欢迎。
    二是由于高龄化社会的到来，人们为了安排晚年生活，利用保险的手段，增加了个人储蓄的途径。
    目前，保险公司以自己雄厚的资金量为后盾，加强了本公司综合金融机关的职能。这样，保险公司与银行、邮政储蓄的行业间竞争进一步激化。银行和邮政部门今后如何吸收国民的资金已成了一个重要的研究课题。
