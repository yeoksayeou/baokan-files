People's Daily, Nanjing, August 20th. Reporter Gong Yongquan reports: In mid-July, the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission received a letter from a citizen. The letter reported that a "Quality Management Enhancement and Hospital Management Mechanism Improvement Seminar" scheduled to be held in Changzhou on August 20th was actually a meeting disguised as a study session but intended for tourism. The letter also enclosed a copy of the meeting notice.

The notice stated that in addition to informing about the accommodation hotel and providing shuttle services for the meeting, it also mentioned the following: "Each attendee of the meeting is required to pay a conference fee of 250 yuan, and the accommodation expenses will be reimbursed by their units. The meeting will last for 5 days, and it is planned to visit Changzhou, Yixing, Suzhou, and Wuxi for learning and observation."

After receiving the letter, the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission promptly notified the Changzhou Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission to investigate. It was learned that this meeting was organized by the National Hospital Quality Management Cooperation Group, with about 300 participants from more than 20 provinces and cities across the country. Under the intervention of the provincial and municipal discipline inspection commissions, the Changzhou Municipal Medical Management Association, which was responsible for organizing the meeting, decided to cancel this seminar. All collected fees were refunded in full.

    江苏省纪委根据群众举报
    及时制止一次借研讨搞游玩的会议
    本报南京8月20日电　记者龚永泉报道：7月中旬，江苏省纪委收到一封群众举报信，反映拟于8月20日在常州召开的“强化质量管理与完善医院经营机制研讨会”是一次借开会为名、行旅游之实的会议。这封信还附有该会议的通知一份。
    通知内除了告知下榻宾馆及有会议专车接送外，耐人寻味的是以下内容：“出席会议的每位代表交会务费250元，住宿费回单位报销。会期5天，会议拟安排到本市、宜兴、苏州、无锡参观学习”。
    江苏省纪委接到该信后，及时通知常州市纪委调查。据了解，这次会议是由全国医院质量管理协作组召开的，会议规模300人左右，代表来自全国20多个省市。在省市纪委干预下，承办会议的常州市医学管理学会决定取消这次研讨会，所收的款项全部退回。
