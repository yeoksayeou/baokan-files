Beijing Military Region's certain army corps conducted a week-long exercise, adhering to the spirit of hard work and frugality. They strictly curbed the practice of excessive spending during exercises, such as buying gifts, decorating facilities, and distributing "souvenirs." The total expenditure for this exercise was less than 100,000 yuan, a stark contrast to the over 1,000,000 yuan spent on similar exercises last year.

In the past, when organizing such large-scale tactical exercises, the army corps often distributed items like sunglasses, work bags, and vests as "souvenirs," and engaged in reciprocal banquets, resulting in enormous expenditures. This time, the military leadership issued an order to the participating units to uphold the spirit of hard work and frugal training, focusing on improving efficiency, strengthening the headquarters, and tempering the troops.

Adhering to the principle of meticulous planning and resourcefulness, they made do with what they had and repurposed old materials. The participating units manufactured and welded 250 sets of training equipment, such as steel frames for shelters and work tables and chairs. Instead of being issued training tents, the regiments borrowed 20 tents from the warehouse and local railway departments for temporary use. When certain exercise equipment was not immediately available, they borrowed from local residents.

During this exercise, from the leadership to the participating officers and soldiers, no one purchased "souvenirs." Even items like flashlights and hats were bought by themselves. No one was found to have taken advantage of the exercise to visit scenic spots. Despite the low expenditure, the exercise achieved significant results, meeting the expected objectives.

    演习精打细算　耗资不足万元
    某军注重实效勤俭练兵
    本报太原电　北京军区某集团军在为期一周的演习中，始终贯彻艰苦奋斗的精神，狠治趁演习之际突击花钱购物、装潢“门面”、滥发“纪念品”等弊病，整个演习总耗资不足一万元，与去年同期此类演习耗资逾百万元形成鲜明对照。
    以往，这个集团军在组织此类规模的战役战术演习时，往往发变色镜、作业包、背心等各种“纪念品”，相互吃请，耗资惊人。这次演习，军领导就电令参演部队要发扬艰苦奋斗和勤俭练兵的精神，从提高效益出发，锻炼机关、摔打部队。
    他们本着精打细算的原则，因陋就简，修旧利废。参演各部队自制、焊接掩蔽工事钢架、作业桌椅等训练器材250件（套）。各团没有配发训练帐篷，他们便从仓库、地方铁路部门借了20顶帐篷暂用。有的演习用具一时没有，便向当地群众借。
    这次演习，这个集团军从领导机关到参演部队官兵，一律没有购买“纪念品”，就连手电筒、草帽也由自己去买，也没有发现一人乘演习之机去风景名胜游玩的。这次演习尽管耗资少，但收效大，达到了预期的目的。　（张邦邦　朱光伟）
