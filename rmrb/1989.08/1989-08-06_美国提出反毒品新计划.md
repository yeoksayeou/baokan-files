The People's Daily, Washington, August 4th

    The United States government's Director of Drug Enforcement (Director of the National Narcotics Control Bureau), William Bennett, today presented a new anti-drug strategy to the White House Domestic Policy Committee, calling for strengthened penalties against drug users.

    This 232-page plan suggests enacting new laws to mandate compulsory treatment for suspected drug offenders and impose harsher penalties on first-time drug offenders, including publishing their names in newspapers, revoking their driver's licenses, and detention. The plan proposes establishing a national anti-drug prevention service corps, a national anti-drug intelligence center, and a drug control research and development committee to strengthen anti-drug efforts. It also requires universities to implement strict anti-drug campus regulations.

    To this end, the federal government will increase funding to state and local governments to enforce these measures and allocate more funds for the construction of new prisons, drug rehabilitation centers, and anti-drug education programs.

    Bennett acknowledged that while this strategy is "serious and effective," it should not be expected to yield immediate results. He stated that there is currently no magic solution to quickly resolve the drug problem.

    美国提出反毒品新计划
    本报华盛顿8月4日电  美国政府缉毒总监（全国毒品管制局局长）威廉·贝内特今天向白宫对内政策委员会提出反毒品新战略，加强对吸毒分子的惩处。
    这份长达232页的计划建议制定新的法律，对可疑的吸毒犯进行强制治疗，对吸毒初犯分子给予更严厉的惩罚，包括在报上公布姓名、吊销汽车驾驶执照和拘留。计划提出建立全国预防吸毒服务队、全国反毒品情报中心、毒品控制研究与发展委员会，以加强扫毒行动，并要求各大学制定禁毒的有力校规。
    为此，联邦将向州和地方政府增加拨款以推行执法，并增加对建立新监狱和吸毒诊疗所以及开展反吸毒教育的经费。
    贝内特承认，虽然此项战略“严肃、有力”，但不能期望过高。他说，目前还没有神通的办法，能够迅速解决吸毒问题。
