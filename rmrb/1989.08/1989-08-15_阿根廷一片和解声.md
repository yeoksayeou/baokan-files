Argentina is experiencing a wave of reconciliation. In the month since Carlos Menem took office as the new president, the country's economic situation has shown signs of improvement, and various social conflicts are gradually easing.

On the day Menem took office, he called for national reconciliation and the establishment of a "unity government."

Firstly, on the sensitive issue of the military, although the government has not yet come up with specific solutions, the general approach is to seek a resolution that is "beneficial to national reconciliation." Menem has repeatedly stated that he will personally handle this matter and resolve it by the end of the year. Recently, the government has been hinting at the possibility of pardoning military personnel who were tried or sentenced for participating in three mutinies, human rights violations in the anti-subversion struggle, and the defeat in the Falklands War. Apart from some human rights organizations and the "left wing," other sectors have expressed support for this.

Secondly, in the economic sphere, Menem's government's austerity plan has gotten off to a successful start, as evidenced by: controlling high inflation, stabilizing prices, stabilizing the exchange market, increasing foreign exchange reserves, and business satisfaction. To compensate for the losses suffered by the salaried class due to the initial price hikes of the plan, both public and private sectors have appropriately increased workers' wages. Coupled with other subsidies, the actual purchasing power of the salaried class is recovering.

In foreign policy, the Menem government is attempting to improve relations with Britain, also reflecting a spirit of reconciliation.

Menem's policy of reconciliation both domestically and internationally is conducive to the country's political stability and economic development, and has been welcomed by various sectors of society.

    阿根廷一片和解声
    新华社记者　可大安
    阿根廷新总统梅内姆执政一个月来，国家的经济形势呈现良好势头，各种社会矛盾渐趋缓和。
    梅内姆就职头一天就呼吁全国和解，建立一个“团结政府”。
    首先，在十分敏感的军人问题上，政府虽然尚未拿出具体办法，但基调是要作出“有利于全国和解”的解决。梅内姆多次表示此事他要亲自处理，年底以前最终解决。近来，官方不断放出试探气球，要对因参加3次哗变、在反颠覆斗争中侵犯人权和马岛战争失利而受审或判刑的军人实行赦免。对此，除一些人权组织和“左派”外，其他各界均表示支持。
    其次，在经济方面，梅内姆政府执行的经济紧缩计划成功起步，主要表现在：高通货膨胀得到控制，物价趋于稳定，汇兑市场平稳，外汇储备增加，企业界表示满意。为补偿工薪阶层因计划执行初期物价猛涨而受到的损失，公私部门都相应地提高了职工工资。加上其他各种补助，工薪阶层的实际购买力在恢复。
    在对外政策上，梅内姆政府试图改善同英国的关系，也体现出一种和解精神。
    梅内姆总统对内对外推行和解的政策，有利于国家的政治稳定和经济发展，得到社会各界的欢迎。
