Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 7th.

According to a recent issue of the American "Oil and Gas Magazine," by the fourth quarter of this year, the global demand for oil from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is estimated to reach 21.6 million barrels per day.

The magazine states that unless an economic recession occurs, the situation in the global oil market appears to be turning in favor of OPEC.

After determining the production quotas for the first half of this year, OPEC significantly reduced the overproduction of its member countries, leading to a rise in oil prices.

The current production quota, which took effect in July this year, requires OPEC member countries to produce a maximum of 19.5 million barrels per day.

The magazine points out that in the first half of this year, OPEC's actual average daily production was 20.287 million barrels, although this exceeded the quota by a significant margin, it was not enough to put pressure on oil prices. In fact, throughout the first quarter, the export price of crude oil was on the rise.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th.

Jakarta News: Indonesian Minister of Mining and Energy Ginanjar Kartasasmita said on the 7th that the price of oil exported by Indonesia to Japan in the first three weeks of this month dropped to $17.26 per barrel.

The export price in July was $17.94 per barrel.

Ginanjar said that the current price set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is $16.58 per barrel.

He said, "As long as OPEC member countries remain united, a price of $18 per barrel is achievable."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 7th.

According to a recent issue of the American "Oil and Gas Magazine," the United States' oil production in the first half of this year is estimated to average 7.825 million barrels per day, a 5.3% decrease from the same period last year.

Part of the reason for the decrease is that the daily production of the Alaskan oil fields has decreased by 120,000 barrels, reducing the average daily production to 1.911 million barrels.

The magazine predicts that for the rest of this year, U.S. oil production will continue to decline at a slow pace, with daily production expected to drop to 7.79 million barrels by the fourth quarter.

    世界对欧佩克石油需求增加
    印尼石油出口价下跌  美国石油生产下降
    据新华社纽约8月7日电　据美国《油气杂志》最近一期报道，到今年第4季度，世界对石油输出国组织（欧佩克）的石油需求量估计达每天2160万桶。
    该杂志说，除非出现经济衰退，世界石油市场的形势看来正开始转向对欧佩克有利。
    欧佩克在确定今年上半年的生产定额以后，大大地削减了其成员国的超产部分，致使油价上扬。
    从今年7月份生效的欧佩克的现行生产定额，要求其成员国最高总产为每天1950万桶。
    杂志指出，今年上半年，欧佩克实际平均日产为2028.7万桶，虽然超过定额相当多，但还不足以对油价造成压力，事实上，在整个第1季度，出口原油价是上升的。
    新华社北京8月8日电  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚矿业和能源部长吉南贾尔·卡塔萨斯米塔7日说，印度尼西亚本月前三周向日本出口的石油价格降至每桶17.26美元。
    7月份的出口价格为每桶17.94美元。
    吉南贾尔说，石油输出国组织（欧佩克）的现行价格为每桶16.58美元。
    他说：“只要欧佩克成员国紧密团结，每桶18美元的价格是能够达到的。”
    据新华社纽约8月7日电  据美国《油气杂志》最近一期报道，美国今年上半年的石油生产估计平均每天为782.5万桶，比去年同期下降了5.3％。
    减产的部分原因是阿拉斯加油田日产量减少12万桶，使平均日产降到191.1万桶。
    该杂志预计，今年剩下的时间，美国的石油生产还将低速下降，到今年第4季度日产量将降至779万桶。
