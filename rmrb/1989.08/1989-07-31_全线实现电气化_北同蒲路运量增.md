Today morning, the last section of the electrification project of the Beiping-Tongpu Railway, a key project of the state's "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the Yuanping to Shuozhou section (the middle section of Beiping-Tongpu), successfully completed its first power transmission, thus making the entire electrification project fully operational. After the opening, the annual traffic volume of the middle section will increase from 5 million tons before the opening to over 14 million tons; the average annual traffic volume of the entire line will be 2.5 to 3 times higher than before electrification.
