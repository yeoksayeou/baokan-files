Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 2nd.

Five foreign trade units in Fujian recently set up examination halls in Fuzhou, Putian, and Zhangzhou to openly recruit talents from graduates of colleges, universities, and vocational schools across the province. Over 600 applicants will compete fairly to secure their desired professions.

Fujian Province previously attempted a method where college graduates could recommend themselves to employers, which caused much trouble for many graduates and their families. Graduates and their families, lacking knowledge of societal needs, had to rely on various connections to find jobs, and some students expressed dissatisfaction.

This open recruitment is jointly organized by the Fujian Provincial Personnel Bureau and the Provincial Foreign Economic and Trade Commission. The five foreign trade units—Fujian Provincial Foreign Economic and Trade Commission, Fujian Provincial Foreign Trade Corporation, Fujian International Economic and Technological Cooperation Corporation, Huafu Corporation, and Huamin Corporation based in Hong Kong—will recruit 218 business personnel and managerial staff through this examination.

A responsible person from the Fujian Provincial Personnel Bureau stated that this method of openly recruiting talents is an attempt to reform the allocation system for college and university graduates. This not only provides graduates with the opportunity to compete fairly for popular professions but also strongly promotes the reform of higher education and accelerates the cultivation of high-quality talents that meet societal needs.

    闽涉外经贸单位设考场公平竞争求取热门职业
    新华社福州8月2日电  （通讯员许东、记者周俊祥）福建省5家涉外经贸单位最近在福州市、莆田市、漳州市设立考场，在全省大中专以及职业大学应届毕业生中公开招考人才。报名应考的600多名考生将通过公开竞争，求取自己满意的职业。
    福建省今年曾一度试行让高校毕业生自荐找用人单位的办法，这给不少毕业生和家长带来烦恼。毕业生和家长不了解社会需求，只好托各种关系走后门，一些学生甚有抱怨。
    这次公开招考是福建省人事局和省外经贸委联合举办的。5家涉外经贸单位——省外经贸委、省外贸总公司、中国福建国际经济技术合作公司、华福公司和驻香港的华闽公司，将通过这次招考，录用218名业务人员和管理干部。
    福建省人事局负责人说，这种公开招考人才的办法，是改革大中专毕业生分配制度的一种尝试，这不仅使毕业生有了公平竞争、求取热门职业的机会，对大中专院校改革教育、加速培养符合社会需求的高素质人才也是有力的促进。
