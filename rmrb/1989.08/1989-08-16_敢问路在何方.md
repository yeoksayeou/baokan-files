How can we quickly change the backward situation of transportation? The People's Daily has been discussing this issue since the article "Railways Are Struggling and Crying Out" was published on March 9. Many comrades have enthusiastically written letters and articles, analyzing the current situation and problems of railway construction, and discussing strategies and methods to change the backward situation. This has attracted the attention of decision-making departments at all levels.

Changing the backward situation of transportation is not just about railways; roads are an extremely important component. If railways are the "main arteries," then roads are the vast network of large and small "veins" that permeate the entire country. Developing China's transportation, without the development of roads, is unimaginable. "Where Is the Road?" tells us that in the past 40 years, China's roads have increased by 11 times, totaling one million kilometers. In terms of absolute numbers, road construction has achieved significant results. However, road construction is far from meeting the needs of national economic development, with insufficient quantity and low standards. How to accelerate road construction and alleviate transportation difficulties is an urgent problem that needs to be solved.

"Where Is the Road?" is intended to spark discussion. We welcome contributions from all sectors. Please send your articles to the Economic Department, Transportation Discussion Group of the People's Daily (mark as Transportation Discussion).

If railways are the "main arteries," then roads are the vast network of large and small "veins" that permeate the entire body. The development of China's transportation industry naturally cannot do without the development of road transportation. So, what is the current situation of China's road transportation?

Since liberation, roads have developed rapidly, but compared to the needs of national economic development, they are still insufficient in quantity, low in standards, and poor in quality. Currently, there are 999,900 kilometers of roads nationwide, 80.5% of which are built on the basis of simple rural paths. Roads can no longer withstand the pressure of rapidly increasing traffic.

By the end of 1988, China's road mileage was 999,553 kilometers, 12 times that of 1949. In just the past 10 years of reform and opening up, nearly 150,000 kilometers of new roads have been built. A few years ago, first-class roads and expressways, which were still unfamiliar to the Chinese people, have now made a breakthrough, with 1,673 kilometers and 147 kilometers respectively marked on the map of the Republic. It can be said that in the past 40 years, China's road construction has achieved significant results.

However, in terms of land area, China has only 103 meters of roads per square kilometer, which is only 5% to 20% of developed countries. Moreover, the road conditions are quite troublesome. A folk song goes: "Driving is tough, driving is tough, the driver's heart is pounding. The roads are not smooth, often obstructed, and we are most afraid of landslides blocking the car."

Among nearly one million kilometers of roads, 805,400 kilometers are fourth-class roads and below. There are 106,000 kilometers of national highways, of which 43,800 kilometers are fourth-class roads and below. Of the 162,000 kilometers of provincial roads, 96,600 kilometers are low-grade roads. There are 12,000 kilometers of "bottleneck roads" on national highways, known as "esophageal cancer" by the people, and 25,000 kilometers of "dead-end roads" on provincial roads. There are 160,000 bridges nationwide, of which more than 13,000 are dangerous bridges in urgent need of reconstruction. There are 648 road ferries nationwide, many of which are manually operated. Many ferries often cause vehicles to stop and wait, becoming a major headache for roads that are "disconnected and worrying."

Historically, the Chinese people have had a fine tradition of building bridges and repairing roads. Now, most of China's roads are built through non-capital construction methods such as "labor for construction," "public-private partnership," and "work relief." The road network layout has a high degree of randomness, and many existing trunk roads have long since reached their "retirement" age.

According to observations and statistics by relevant departments over the years, the current annual average daily traffic volume on national highways is 2,500 vehicles, and around major and medium-sized cities, it is generally around 10,000 vehicles. Roads are in a state of over-saturation and overload, with many roads' actual traffic volume exceeding their design capacity by 4 to 5 times.

Road construction has no budget in the state, and the limited road maintenance fees and vehicle purchase surcharges are like the flesh of Tang Monk, making many people envious. The "reverse tilt" policy in road construction makes existing roads thinner and thinner, and new road construction faces numerous difficulties. For a long time, China's road construction investment, except for national defense and border roads, has had no budget in the state's basic construction budget. From 1950 to 1987, the state allocated only 6 billion yuan for road construction, less than 0.6% of the basic construction budget during the same period. This meager investment is not enough even for national defense and border road construction.

In the past 10 years, the call to "get rich first by building roads" has become louder and louder. In 1984, the state made three major decisions on road construction: first, to raise the road maintenance fee collection standard; second, to levy a vehicle purchase surcharge; and third, to allow roads and bridges built with collective funds and loans to collect tolls. These three decisions have injected vitality into road construction and, to some extent, reversed the previous situation of no funding for road construction.

Of the 10 billion yuan in road maintenance fees collected each year, only about 20%, or 2-3 billion yuan, is used for road construction, excluding routine road maintenance and major repairs. If calculated by the average of 30 provinces and cities, each province has only 700 million yuan, which can only build 10-20 kilometers of first-class roads or 30-40 kilometers of second-class roads.

Even so, it is still quite difficult to get things done. Currently, the state collects 15% of the total amount each year as the energy and transportation construction fund, and the road maintenance fee is collected based on the total amount collected. As the name suggests, this fund should be used for key energy and transportation construction, but in reality, it is included in the state's financial budget revenue and is not used for specific purposes. The funds collected from the transportation department are not returned to the transportation department.

Starting this year, the state has also levied a 10% national budget adjustment fund to control the construction of funds outside the budget. China's road construction is now encouraged to develop vigorously and does not have this problem. However, relevant departments still collect road maintenance fees as usual. In addition, the current tax rate for collecting land occupation tax for transportation construction is too high. According to the road construction scale during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the national road construction needs to pay approximately 1 billion yuan, not including the numerous extortions and levies in many places.

The "one tax and two funds," plus the annual traffic management subsidy allocated to the public security department, account for more than 30% of the road maintenance fee income, basically offsetting the policy subsidies given to roads by the state. Some places cannot even guarantee the wages of road maintenance workers and the funds needed for simple reproduction.

Transportation has long been listed as a strategic focus for national economic development. Some people involved in road construction have called for correcting the "reverse tilt" phenomenon and implementing a genuine "tilt policy" now.

A red flag waving along the road, it's either toll collection or fines. Road management is chaotic. Cars, tractors, animal-drawn carts, bicycles, pedestrians, and motorcycles all mix and drive on the road, with an average speed of only 37 kilometers per hour for cars, and two cars are equivalent to one in use; about 50,000 people die in traffic accidents each year.

Someone conducted a survey and found that there are at least five or six major departments conducting inspections on the road under various names: public security, transportation, agricultural machinery, industry and commerce, taxation, forestry, etc.

To deal with the numerous inspections, drivers usually carry more than 10 certificates in their pockets, with the most carrying more than 20, to the point of shaking out their bags when encountering inspections and letting others choose. Arbitrary fines are quite common. A driver humorously said: "Nowadays, traffic management is 'stopping cars to salute safety, tearing tickets to fine and detain licenses.'"

The responsibilities given to the road management department by the state are to build and maintain roads, and to manage the transportation industry, road management, and traffic management, and to be responsible for the collection of road maintenance fees, transportation management fees, and other statutory fees. However, due to inconsistent orders, the road management department is now often restricted by relevant departments when executing tasks on the road, and even conflicts occur, making it difficult to timely and effectively inspect, stop, and handle many serious acts of damaging roads and their facilities, tax evasion, and refusal to pay road fees. Last year, in a certain province in the south, the road maintenance fee was overdue by several thousand yuan. How much is it nationwide? It is really an unestimable number. On one hand, road construction funds are severely lacking; on the other hand, a large amount of road maintenance fees and other statutory fees are not collected. The road department is worried.

Chaotic road traffic management has resulted in a high number of casualties. China has more than 50,000 people dying in traffic accidents each year, and about 180,000 people are injured or disabled. Worldwide, 500,000 people die in traffic accidents each year, and China accounts for 1/10. In 1988, 54,814 people died in road traffic accidents in China, equivalent to a fully loaded Boeing 707 crashing every day!

Some of China's trunk roads are not narrow, but now cars, tractors, animal-drawn carts, bicycles, motorcycles, and pedestrians are all crowded onto the roads, and they are each doing their own thing without yielding to each other. Some road sections even have cars not as fast as bicycles.

According to experts, if cars and other traffic elements on the road are appropriately separated, the traffic capacity can be increased by 1 to 2 times, and traffic accidents can be reduced by 70%.

Road traffic calls for a modernized management of vehicles, people, and roads.

The "hardening" of the railway's main artery has attracted worldwide attention; the serious lag in road construction must not be ignored. If road construction is not accelerated, it will not only seriously affect China's economic development in this century but also seriously hinder China's economic takeoff in the next century.

Road transportation is currently the most active, widespread, and promising mode of transportation in the world. Only it can reach every corner of society, with many points and wide coverage, flexible and mobile, and can achieve "door-to-door" transportation, which other modes of transportation cannot replace.

According to relevant departments, China's road transportation volume is growing rapidly, and by the year 2000, the road freight volume will be nearly 16 billion tons, with a turnover of 610 billion ton-kilometers; the passenger volume will be 17 billion person-trips, with a turnover of 890 billion person-kilometers. After the year 2000, for several years, the growth of road transportation volume will still be relatively high. Facing such a high demand for road transportation, many experts believe that from now until the first few decades of the next century, it is a critical period for China's road construction, and road construction needs a breakthrough:

First, update concepts and strengthen the awareness of "big transportation," truly acting according to the law of transportation first. Currently, it is necessary to quickly establish a development strategy for road transportation and implement a tilt policy. Even if we borrow money, we should build more roads, so we can do many things.

Second, reasonably adjust prices. In the past 40 years since liberation, China's road passenger and freight prices have not only not increased but have been reduced seven times. Many transportation enterprises are already operating at a loss. If the price policy is not adjusted, it will be unfavorable for the development of roads and also for the development of railways.

Third, implement the policy of "everyone building transportation," open up more channels, and raise funds from various sources to accelerate road construction. In the future, the state will mainly be responsible for the construction of national highways and important roads, encouraging local areas to use various forms such as social fundraising and labor for construction to build county and township roads.

Fourth, stabilize policies and secure funding channels to truly achieve the use of road construction funds for specific purposes. Currently, it is necessary to quickly improve the collection and use methods of the "one tax and two funds" in road construction.

Fifth, govern roads by law and seriously manage road traffic. The urgent task is to solve the problem of unclear responsibilities and poor working relationships between the public security and transportation departments in road traffic management. Seriously investigate and punish acts of damaging roads and their facilities, tax evasion, and extortion using power.

Sixth, rectify the transportation market and strengthen the control and management of social vehicles. Currently, China's civilian vehicle ownership has reached more than 4.6 million vehicles. According to a survey, every year, 48% of freight vehicles are empty, causing an economic loss of 5.9 billion yuan. Especially, enterprise vehicles participating in social commercial transportation do not pay taxes and profits, amounting to 3-4 billion yuan each year. In the future, it is necessary to strictly limit the blind development of vehicles in government agencies and enterprises and support the national team of professional road transportation.

Seventh, rely on technological progress to accelerate the construction of the national road backbone and strive to maintain the existing roads. According to expert arguments, to basically adapt to China's economic takeoff, China's road mileage should be more than 2 million kilometers. That is to say, in the next 10-20 years, we need to build more than 1 million kilometers of roads, otherwise, by the year 2000, China's road freight will face even heavier pressure, and passenger transportation will become a serious social problem.

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    敢问路在何方
    本报记者　张国荣
    我国交通运输发展为什么滞后？本报自3月9日《铁路在拚搏中呼喊》一文开篇展开讨论，许多同志满腔热情，来信来稿，分析铁路建设的现状和问题，谈改变滞后局面的对策和办法，引起了各级决策部门的重视。
    改变交通滞后局面，不仅是铁路，公路是极其重要的组成部分。如果说铁路是“大动脉”的话，公路则是遍布全国的大大小小的“血管”。发展我国交通运输，离开了公路的发展，那是不可想象的。《敢问路在何方》告诉人们，40年来，我国公路增长了11倍，全长百万公里。从绝对数来讲，公路建设取得了不小的成绩。但是，公路建设远远适应不了国民经济发展的需要，数量少，标准低。如何加快公路建设，缓解交通运输困难，是一个亟待解决的问题。
    《敢问路在何方》算是抛砖引玉，欢迎各界人士来稿。来稿请寄人民日报经济部工交组（注明交通讨论稿）。
                                  ——编者    
    如果说铁路是“大动脉”的话，那么公路则是由大大小小“血管”组成的遍布全身的循环网络。发展我国交通事业，自然离不开公路运输的发展。那么，我国公路交通的状况如何呢？
    解放以来公路有了迅速发展，但同国民经济发展的要求相比，还是数量少，标准低，质量差。全国现有99.9万公里公路，80.5％是在简易小道基础上搞起来的。公路已经受不住迅猛增长的交通量的压力
    截至1988年底，我国的公路里程有999553公里，是1949年的12倍。单是改革开放这10年间，就新修了将近15万公里的公路。几年前，对国人来说还十分陌生的一级路和高速公路，也实现零的突破，在共和国的地图上分别标出了代表1673公里和147公里的红线。应该说，40年来我国公路建设取得了不小成绩。
    然而，就国土面积来说，我国每平方公里仅有103米公路，只相当于发达国家的5％—20％。而且大量的路况让人“伤脑筋”。有首打油诗这样形容说：“上路苦，上路苦，司机心里直打鼓。道路不畅通，经常受拦阻，更怕塌方把车堵。”
    在将近100万公里的公路中，有80.54万公里是四级路和等外路。全国共有国道10.6万公里，四级路和等外路占4.38万公里。在16.2万公里的省道上，9.66万公里是低等级的路。国道上尚有1.2万公里被群众称为“食道癌”的卡脖子路，省道上有2.5万公里“断头路”。全国现有16万座桥梁，有13000多座危桥亟待改建。全国648处公路渡口，许多是人力摆渡。不少渡口常发生停车待渡，成为公路“联不上，愁断肠”的一大心病。
    历史上，我国人民素有修桥补路的优良传统。现在，我国的绝大部分公路也都是利用“民工建勤”、“民办公助”、“以工代赈”等非基本建设途径搞起来的，路网布局带有很大的随意性，而且现有的很多干线公路，路面早已到了“退役”年龄。
    据有关部门多年来的观测统计，现在国道年平均日交通量为2500车次，各大中城市周围，大都在1万车次左右。公路处于超饱和、超负荷的服务状态，许多公路的实际通过量已超过设计能力4至5倍。
    公路建设投资国家没有户头，仅有的养路费、车辆购置附加费，犹如唐僧肉，不少人看着眼馋。公路建设上的“倒倾斜”政策，使现有公路越养越瘦，新路建设困难重重长期以来，我国公路建设投资，除国防、边防公路外，在国家基本建设预算内没有户头。从1950年到1987年，国家对公路建设拨款仅60亿元，不足同期预算内基本建设拨款的0.6％。这点可怜的投资，单用于国防、边防公路建设都不够。
    近10年来，“要想富，先修路”的呼声越来越高。1984年国家对公路建设作出三项重大决策：一是提高公路养路费的征收标准；二是开征车辆购置附加费；三是允许集资和贷款修建的公路和桥梁征收通行费。这三项决策给公路建设增添了活力，一定程度上扭转了过去公路建设资金无来源的局面。
    在每年征收的100亿元养路费中，除用于经常性的公路养护和大修理外，用于公路建设的仅占20％左右，即每年20多亿元。若以30个省市平均计算，每省只有7000万元，用这些钱只能建一级路10多公里，建二级路30多公里。
    即使这样，事情办起来还是相当艰难。现在国家每年按总额15％开征能源交通建设基金，对养路费是按征收总额计征的。顾名思义，这项资金理应用于能源交通重点建设，但实际上是作为国家财政预算收入，没有专款专用，从交通部门征收的也没有返还给交通部门。
    从今年开始，国家又开征10％的国家预算调节基金，目的是控制预算外的资金的建设。我国的公路建设现在是国家鼓励大力发展，不存在这个问题。可是有关部门对养路费还是要照征不误。此外，现行关于征收交通建设耕地占用税的税率偏高，按“七五”期间的公路建设规模，全国公路建设需缴纳约10亿元，还不包括许多地方名目繁多的敲诈勒索。
    “一税两基金”，再加上每年拨给公安部门的交通管理补助费，足足占去公路养路费收入的30％以上，基本上将国家给予公路的政策性补贴，又都全部挖了回去。一些地方连养路工人的工资和维持简单再生产的资金都难保证。
    交通运输早被列为国民经济发展的战略重点，一些从事公路建设的人士呼吁，现在是纠正“倒倾斜现象”，正确实行“倾斜政策”的时候了。
    一路“红旗招展”，不是收费便是罚款。公路管理存在混乱现象。汽车、拖拉机、畜力车、自行车、行人混合行驶，汽车平均时速仅37公里，两辆车只顶一辆用；每年约有5万人死于交通事故
    有人作过调查，现在打着各种名义在公路上进行检查的大的部门至少有五六家：公安、交通、农机、工商、税务、林业等。
    为了应付名目繁多的检查，驾驶员兜里一般都要揣着10多本证件，最多的要带20多个，以至遇到检查不知需要哪个时就抖尽包包，任君挑选。任意罚款相当普遍。一位司机幽默地说：如今的交通管理就是“拦车敬礼说安全，撕票罚款扣证件。”
    国家赋予公路主管部门的职责是修路、养路，搞好运政、路政和行业管理，负责养路费、运管费等规费的征收工作。然而由于政令不一，如今公路主管部门上路依法执行任务却屡屡受到有关部门的钳制，甚至发生冲突，致使许多严重破坏公路及其设施，逃税、抗缴公路规费等违法行为得不到及时而有效的检查、制止和处理。去年，南方某省仅养路费欠收就达数千万元。全国知多少？实在是个难以估计的数字。一方面公路建设资金严重短缺；一方面大量的公路养路费等规费又收不上来。公路部门对此忧心如焚。
    公路交通管理混乱，带来的恶果之一是伤亡事故惨重。我国每年死于车祸的达5万余人，伤残18万人左右。全世界每年有50万人死于交通事故，我国占1／10。1988年我国道路交通事故死亡54814人，相当于每天坠毁一架满员的波音707客机！
    我国的一些干线公路并不狭窄，然而现在是汽车、拖拉机、畜力车、自行车、摩托车、行人等都往公路上挤，而且是我行我素，互不礼让，一些路段甚至汽车没有自行车快。
    据有关专家测算，如果将公路上汽车与其它交通元素适当分离，可提高通行能力1到2倍，交通事故也可减少70％。
    公路交通呼唤着车、人、路三位一体的现代化管理。
    铁路大动脉的“硬化症”，已为世人瞩目；公路建设的严重滞后，也切不可置若罔闻。再不加快公路建设，不仅要严重影响本世纪我国的经济发展，还要严重拖下个世纪我国经济腾飞的后腿
    公路运输是当今世界上最活跃、最广泛、最富有潜力的一种运输方式。唯有它的触角能伸向社会的各个角落，点多面广，机动灵活，能实现“门到门”的运输，是其他运输方式所无法替代的。
    据有关部门预测，我国公路运输量的增长很快，到2000年公路货运量近160亿吨，周转量为6100亿吨公里；客运量为170亿人次，周转量为8900亿人公里。2000年以后若干年内，公路运输量的增长仍将比较高。面对如此高的公路运输需求，许多专家认为，从现在到下个世纪的前十几年，是我国公路建设的关键时期，公路建设要有大的突破：
    第一，更新观念，强化“大交通”意识，真正按交通先行规律办事。当前需尽快确立公路运输的发展战略，实行倾斜政策，就是借债，也要多修点路，那样我们将可以办很多事情。
    第二，合理调整运价。解放40年来，我国公路客货运价非但没有提高，反而7次降价。许多运输企业已收不抵支。价格政策若不调整，对公路发展不利，对铁路发展也不利。
    第三，贯彻大家办交通的方针，广开门路，多方筹资，加快公路建设。今后国家主要负责国道和重要公路建设，鼓励地方利用社会集资、民工建勤等多种形式，大力修建县乡道路。
    第四，稳定政策，落实资金渠道，真正做到公路建设专款专用。目前，应尽快改进公路建设上“一税两基金”的征集和使用办法。
    第五，依法治路，认真搞好公路交通管理。当务之急是要解决好公安、交通两部门在道路交通管理中的职责范围不清、工作关系不顺的问题。严肃查处破坏公路及其设施，偷税漏税和利用职权敲诈勒索等违法犯罪活动。
    第六，整顿运输市场，加强社会汽车的控制和管理。现在我国民用汽车保有量已达460多万辆，据调查，全国每年有48％货运汽车在空驶，造成经济损失高达59亿元。特别是企事业单位汽车参加社会营业性运输，不缴税利每年有30—40亿元之多。今后应严格限制机关企事业单位汽车盲目发展，扶植公路专业运输这个国家队。
    第七，依靠科技进步，加快全国公路主骨架建设，努力养护好现有公路。据专家论证，为了基本适应我国经济建设的腾飞，我国公路里程以200万公里以上为宜。也就是说在今后一、二十年内，我们要再建100万公里以上公路，否则，到2000年前后，我国公路货运将面临更加沉重压力，客运将会成为严重的社会问题。
