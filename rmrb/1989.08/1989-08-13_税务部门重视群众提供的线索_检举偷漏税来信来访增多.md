Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 13th.

Tax authorities are paying more attention to tips from the public, leading to an increase in reports of tax evasion.

From the State Taxation Administration, it is learned that due to the strengthening of the letter and visit system by tax authorities, reports of tax evasion have significantly increased.

According to a summary and statistical analysis of 23 regions, a total of 13,202 letters from the public were handled last year. The number of letters requesting the implementation of policies to solve historical legacy issues has significantly decreased. Letters reporting tax evasion and misconduct by tax officials account for a large proportion. Using comparable data, the proportion of letters and visits reporting tax evasion has increased from 48.3% in 1987 to 59.2%.

Various local tax authorities have fully utilized the letter and visit system's supervisory role, using tips from the public to investigate and handle a number of tax evasion cases. According to incomplete statistics from Beijing, Hebei, Liaoning, and other regions, a total of 45.42 million yuan in unpaid taxes have been recovered through the letter and visit system.

    税务部门重视群众提供的线索
    检举偷漏税来信来访增多
    新华社北京8月13日电（实习生徐伟）从国家税务局获悉，由于税务部门加强信访工作检举偷税漏税信件和来访显著增加。
    据对23个地区上报的信访工作总结统计分析，去年共处理13202件群众来信，发现要求落实政策解决历史遗留问题的信访数量明显下降，检举偷税漏税和税务干部违纪的来信占有较大的比例。按可比口径计算，检举偷漏税的来信来访所占的比例由1987年的48.3％上升到59.2％。
    各地税务部门充分发挥信访渠道的监督作用，依据群众提供的线索，查处了一批偷税漏税案件。据北京、河北、辽宁等地不完全统计，通过信访渠道共查补税款4542万元。
