Many domestic and foreign tourists who come to Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, are captivated by the graceful scenery of Thousand Island Lake, and cannot help but express their admiration.

Every time I find myself in this picturesque landscape, I share the same sentiment with the other tourists, always being captivated by the grandeur and uniqueness of the scenery.

Isn't it true? As far as the eye can see, 800,000 mu of lush mountains stand tall and majestic, like waves and valleys, stretching along the 960-kilometer-long shoreline of the lake; 800,000 mu of clear green water shimmers like a dazzling, radiant jewel, nestled in its embrace, sparkling brilliantly; 1,078 green islands, like variously shaped potted plants, are embedded in the smooth, jade-like glass plate. In this world of green mountains, green water, and green islands, one can see everywhere the rugged and towering strange rocks and maze-like strange caves. No wonder people praise the green mountains, green water, green islands, and strange rocks and caves here as the "four wonders."

Thousand Island Lake is not just a paradise on earth, but also a "kingdom" of fish beneath the water. This is because the formation of Thousand Island Lake can be traced back to the end of the 1950s when the Xinanjiang Hydropower Station was built, blocking the river water and turning the once fertile fields and thriving livestock into a vast expanse of water, creating today's giant artificial lake. Due to the complex spatial conditions of high and low terrain and the significant differences in water levels, combined with the abundant organic matter, this has created a favorable environment for various fish to settle and reproduce. Additionally, the 800,000 mu of green mountains around the lake, mainly pine forests, when the pine trees bloom and fall, the cloud-like pollen carried by the wind into the lake, provides the fish with a large amount of the best nutrients. Therefore, this place is indeed an ideal world for the habitation and reproduction of freshwater fish. Now, there are more than 80 species of freshwater fish in the lake, in addition to the main domestic fish such as carp, grass carp, bighead carp, silver carp, crucian carp, and bream, there are also valuable wild fish such as mandarin fish, black carp, sturgeon, eel, perch, catfish, white fish, loach, soft-shelled turtle, and so on.

Coming to the "kingdom" of fish production, naturally, there is fish to eat everywhere. Don't believe it? Just go to the county seat, where it is truly "no fish, no meal." As for all the restaurants in the county seat, almost none of them do not serve fish dishes. Those who return from Thousand Island Lake, whenever they talk about fish dishes, cannot help but be enthusiastic and full of praise. What is particularly worth mentioning is the fish specialty restaurant located in the bustling center of the city. This is a six-story building with an ancient and elegant architectural style, with golden ceramic tile walls and green glazed tile roofs, flying eaves and brackets, painted beams and carved pillars. The three large characters "Fish Flavor Restaurant" on the door are written by the painter Ye Qianyu.

A master named Li Shuifa, who has been dealing with fish for more than 20 years, introduced: There are more than 80 species of freshwater fish in Thousand Island Lake, which can be cooked into more than 100 kinds of fish dishes. Just one bighead carp can be cooked into 12 kinds of fish dishes, and a five or six-pound mandarin fish can be cooked into six dishes and one soup.

A trip to Thousand Island Lake not only allows one to fully enjoy the grand and unique "four wonders" scenery, satisfying the eyes, but also allows one to comfortably and happily taste the various delicious fish dishes produced in the lake, satisfying the palate. This cannot be said to be a great pleasure in traveling.

    绰约风姿千岛湖
    饯美
    许多国内外游人来到浙江省淳安县，目睹千岛湖的绰约风姿，都不由得连声发出赞叹。
    每当我身临这似画的妙境，亦与众游人同感，总为那壮而且奇的美景所折服。
    不是吗？眼之所及，80万亩郁郁群峰，巍巍雄伟，似波峰浪谷，绵亘于环湖960公里长的岸线上；80多万亩澄碧绿水，似晶莹夺目的璀璨明珠，投卧其怀抱，熠熠生辉；1078座绿岛，有如百态千姿的盆景，镶嵌在光洁如玉的琉璃盘中。在这山青、水绿、岛翠的绿色世界中，还处处可见嶙峋突兀的奇岩和迷宫式的怪洞，无怪人们把这里的青山、绿水、翠岛和奇岩怪洞赞之为“四绝”。
    千岛湖上虽不失为人间仙境，而千岛湖水下也可称之为鱼的“王国”。此说之由，可要追溯到千岛湖之形成了。原来这里是良田沃野、六畜兴旺的农家，或是薪草遍地、杂树丛生的山丘，自从50年代末建设新安江水电站，拦蓄了江水后，便沦为水域泽国，成了今天这样一个巨大人工湖。由于湖中高低不平的复杂空间和深浅悬殊的水位条件，加之蕴藏着极其丰富的有机物，这就为各种鱼类来此安家落户、繁衍子孙创造了良好环境；还因湖周围的80万亩以松林为主的青翠群山，每当松树花开花落之时，如云似雾的花粉随风飘入湖中，又为鱼儿增添了大量最佳营养品，所以这里确是淡水鱼类栖息繁衍的理想世界。现在，湖中共有80多种淡水鱼，除了青、草、鲢、鳙、鲤、鲫、鳊等主要家鱼外，还有鳜、鲴、鲲、鳗、鲈、鲇、白花、干鳅、甲鱼等名贵野杂鱼。
    到产鱼“王国”来，自然是处处食有鱼。不信，请到县城走一遭，那真个是“无鱼不用餐”。至于县城所有大小餐馆，几乎没有一家不供应鱼味的。从千岛湖归来的人，每谈到鱼味，无不眉飞色舞，赞不绝口。尤值得称道的，是地处城镇中心闹市区的那家专营鱼味的餐馆。这是一座六层高楼房，建筑风格古朴典雅，金黄色的瓷砖墙面，绿色的琉璃瓦屋顶，飞檐斗拱，画栋雕梁，门上那苍劲有力的“鱼味馆”三个大字，是画家叶浅予所题。
    一位跟鱼打了20多年交道的李水法师傅介绍说：千岛湖中有80多种淡水鱼类，能烹制出100多个鱼味来，仅一条鲢鱼，就能烧出12个鱼味品种，一条五六斤重的鳜鱼，可烧出六菜一汤。
    到千岛湖一游，除了能尽情欣赏既壮又奇的“四绝”美景，大饱眼福，还能舒心惬意地品尝那产自湖中的各色鲜美鱼味，以饱口福，这不能不说是旅游中的一大快事。
