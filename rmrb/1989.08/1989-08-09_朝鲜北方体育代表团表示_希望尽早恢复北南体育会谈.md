The North Korean sports delegation expressed the hope for the early resumption of North-South sports talks.

New China News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, today, the head of the North Korean sports delegation, Kim Hyong-jin, sent a telephone notification to the chief representative of the South Korean sports delegation, Chang Chong-sik, through the Red Cross direct telephone line, requesting that North and South resume sports talks as soon as possible to form a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games.

The telephone notification stated that in the second North-South sports talks held in April this year, both sides agreed to complete the selection of athletes and begin joint training by October this year. Accordingly, the sports talks between the two sides should be resumed as soon as possible. However, the South Korean side has indefinitely postponed the third round of talks scheduled for July 18th, and has ignored the North's proposal to resume talks on August 10th. This cannot help but make one suspect whether the South Korean side is sincere about forming a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games. In the telephone notification, Kim Hyong-jin hoped that the South Korean side would not delay the third round of talks any further, and would promptly determine the date of the talks and notify the North.

According to a report by the South Korean Broadcasting Station today, the South Korean sports delegation will formally notify the North Korean sports delegation on the 9th that the third round of talks will be postponed again on the grounds that the "timing for dialogue is not ripe."

    朝鲜北方体育代表团表示
    希望尽早恢复北南体育会谈
    新华社平壤8月8日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜北方体育代表团团长金亨进今天通过红十字会直通电话向南朝鲜体育代表团首席代表张忠植发出电话通知书，要求北南方尽快恢复体育会谈，以便组成统一队参加第十一届亚运会。
    电话通知书说，在今年4月举行的第二次北南体育会谈中，双方同意在今年10月份前完成运动员选拔，并投入共同训练。据此，双方的体育会谈应当早日恢复。但是，南朝鲜方面无限期推迟了原定于7月18日举行的第三次会谈，对北方提出的8月10日恢复会谈的建议置之不理。这不能不使人怀疑南朝鲜方面是否有诚意组成统一队参加第十一届亚运会。金亨进在电话通知书中希望南朝鲜方面不要再推迟第三次会谈，尽早确定会谈日期并通知北方。
    据南朝鲜广播电台今天报道，南朝鲜体育代表团将于9日正式通知北方体育代表团，以“对话时机不成熟”为由再次推迟举行第三次会谈。
