Soviet Athlete Bagach Has Copper Medal Stripped for Doping

Xinhua News Agency, Duisburg, August 26 - Soviet male athlete Alexander Bagach has been stripped of his discus bronze medal from the European Cup athletics competition for using performance-enhancing drugs. The International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) announced this decision on the 25th.

The IAAF medical committee confirmed that a banned hormone was found in Bagach's sample.

The IAAF statement also said that the European Athletics Association has adjusted the final lineup for the World Cup athletics competition. Due to Bagach's disqualification, the Soviet men's track and field team's overall ranking in the European Cup athletics competition dropped from second to third. As a result, the team from the former East Germany, which was originally in third place, moved up to second.
