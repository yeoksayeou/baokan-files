On August 1st of this year, Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory celebrated its 50th anniversary. On this day, the workers of the factory did not engage in feasting or gift-giving but instead invited back the "Old Taihang" who had struggled to establish the factory during the war years, along with soldiers from a certain unit of the martial law troops, to recall the glorious traditions of Taihang. Premier Li Peng inscribed a message encouraging the workers: "The spirit of Taihang fosters entrepreneurship and education, perseverance in hard work endures."

This factory was established in the Taihang Mountains in 1939 and was originally the medical supplies factory for the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the 129th Division. Over the years, the factory's party committee has used various methods to educate the workers about the revolutionary traditions of Taihang. In 1984, the factory's workers' congress established the core spirit of "hard work and thrift in managing the factory" as the "Beijing Pharmaceutical Spirit." Subsequently, they sent people back to the old Taihang area multiple times, compiled a 210,000-word factory history, and invited the "Old Taihang" to give lectures every year. They also produced a video recording the hard work in the Taihang Mountains, using it as a political teaching material for educating the workers.

Due to the emphasis on ideological and political work, the workers' political and professional qualities have continuously improved. In May of this year, the workers of the factory overcame various interferences, and the total industrial output value reached a historical high. The output in June and July also exceeded the same period last year.

    太行精神创业育人  艰苦奋斗历久长新
    北京制药厂传统教育经常化
    本报讯  今年8月1日，北京制药厂迎来建厂50周年。这天，该厂职工没搞吃喝送礼，而是请回曾在战争时期为本厂艰苦创业的“老太行”和戒严部队某部共忆太行光荣传统。国务院总理李鹏题词勉励广大职工：“太行精神创业育人，艰苦奋斗历久长新”。
      这个厂是1939年建于太行山根据地的老厂，原为八路军总部和129师的卫生材料厂。多年来，厂党委利用多种形式，对职工进行太行革命传统教育。1984年的厂职工代表大会，确立了以“艰苦奋斗，勤俭办厂”为核心的“北药精神”。以后，他们又多次派人重返太行故地，编写了21万字的厂史；每年都请“老太行”们回厂作报告；还拍摄了记录太行山艰苦奋斗的录像片，作为教育职工的政治教材。
    由于平时注重思想政治工作，职工政治、业务素质不断提高。今年5月份，该厂职工排除各种干扰，工业总产值创历史最高水平，6—7月份也超过去年同期水平。
