Recently, Datong City decided to conduct a comprehensive review of companies that have already been cleaned up and rectified, ensuring that the cleanup and rectification are thorough and not just a formality.

Since last October, Datong City has listed 552 companies for cleanup and rectification. Among these, 88 companies have received various forms of punishment. Of the 26 party and government officials and 3 retired officials who held positions in these companies, 20 have been separated from the companies, and 9 have been separated from the party and government agencies. However, the cleanup and rectification have not been thorough. Some companies have only rectified themselves, without addressing their subsidiary enterprises. Some companies still have issues with their business methods, business scope, and the economic nature of their enterprises. The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have decided to focus on reviewing those companies that have been retained but have a significant impact on society and have received public complaints. For various types of companies, their subsidiary enterprises, and other enterprises, a thorough review will be conducted through annual inspections, re-registration, and license renewals.

    大同复查清理公司情况
    本报讯　最近，大同市决定，对已清理整顿的公司进行一次全面复查，把清理整顿搞彻底，不走过场。
    自去年10月以来，大同市列入清理整顿的552家公司，有88家公司受到各种处理。其中，在公司任职的26名党政机关干部和3名离退休干部，有20人与公司脱钩，有9人与党政机关脱钩。但清理整顿还很不彻底。一些公司只是对公司本身进行了整顿，其所属企业没有进行整顿；有些公司的经营方式、经营范围和企业的经济性质仍存在问题。市委、市政府决定重点复查那些已经保留，但在社会上影响大、群众又有反映的公司。对各类公司，及其下属企业和其他企业，要通过年检换照，重新登记，进行认真核实。　（王鸿）
