Two books on propaganda work will soon be published by the Central Party School Press. The first book, "Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De on the Party's Propaganda Work," is compiled by the Central Propaganda Department and includes the views of the four leaders on the party's propaganda and ideological work during their long-term revolutionary struggles and construction practices. These views still hold significant guiding importance for today's research on how to strengthen and improve the party's propaganda work.

The second book, "Selected Documents on the Party's Propaganda Work Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee," compiles documents, speeches, and articles from the past decade on the party's propaganda and ideological work, including those from the recent Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the National Conference of Propaganda Department Directors.
