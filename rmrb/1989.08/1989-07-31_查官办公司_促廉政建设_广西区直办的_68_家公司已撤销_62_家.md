The nearly thousand government-run companies in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have mostly or are in the process of ending the era of blurred lines between government and business, and the merging of official and commercial interests. The regional Party Committee and government firmly support the commercial departments in seriously investigating and punishing the illegal activities of government-run companies. This has been used as a breakthrough to investigate and punish corruption across the entire region, with noticeable effects.

Among the more than 7,800 companies listed for rectification in the entire region, 997 were run by government agencies. For example, the Guangxi Huaguang Industrial Development Company, run by the regional government's General Office, from April to June 1988, through the regional grain, oil, and food import and export company as an intermediary, had another company purchase and allocate foreign exchange and advance RMB, purchasing 1,560 tons of white sugar and 549 tons of fertilizer, reselling them at a profit of tens of millions of yuan. The Guangxi Petrochemical Industrial Development Company, run by the regional Chemical Industry Bureau, allocated 2,600 tons of fertilizer and 71 tons of scarce chemical raw materials from several fertilizer plants under the bureau, reselling them before the goods left the warehouse.

The regional Party Committee and government started by investigating and punishing the government agencies, especially the regional-level agencies that run companies, to combat corruption and purify the atmosphere. Among the 68 companies run by regional-level agencies, 62 have been dissolved, and 6 have been decoupled and turned into independent economic entities. The rectification and approval work for various companies across the entire region has been completed by 96.18%. Among the 5,447 party and government cadres who held positions in companies, 4,402 have resigned from their government or company positions.

Currently, the regional government has decided to focus on investigating 18 major cases. The regional bureau of commerce has dispatched personnel to form 5 working groups to assist and guide the investigation in various cities and prefectures.

    查官办公司　促廉政建设
    广西区直办的68家公司已撤销62家
    本报南宁7月31日电　记者郑盛丰报道：广西壮族自治区的近千家党政机关开办的公司，大多数已经或正在结束政企不分、官商合一的历史。区党委、区政府坚决支持工商部门严肃查处官办公司的官倒行为，并以此为突破口在全区范围内查处官倒，惩治腐败，成效日渐显著。
    在全区列入清理整顿范围的7800多家公司中，党政机关开办的公司就有997家。如区政府办公厅办的广西华桂实业开发总公司，于1988年4月至6月，通过区粮油食品进出口公司中介，由另一家公司代购调剂外汇并垫支人民币，购进白糖1560吨、化肥549吨，就地转手加价倒卖，获利数十万元。自治区石化厅开办的广西石油化工实业开发公司，从石化厅下属的几家化肥厂索调化肥2600吨、紧缺的化工原料71吨，货未出仓，转手倒卖。
    广西区党委、区政府从查处官商不分的党政机关特别是区直机关所办公司入手，惩治腐败，纯洁风气。自治区直属机关开办的68家公司，已率先清理完毕，其中撤销62家，脱钩转为独立的经济实体6家。全自治区各类公司的清理审定工作已完成96.18％。在公司兼职的5447名党政干部，已有4402人辞去机关或公司职务。
    目前，区政府决定重点查处18起大案，区工商局已抽调力量组成5个工作组分赴各地市协助指导查处。
