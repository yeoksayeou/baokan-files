The leader of the Philippine congressional delegation reiterated adherence to the "One China" policy.

The Chinese observer delegation, currently in Manila to attend the 10th General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization, held talks today with the Philippine congressional delegation. Both sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern.

Delegates from the Malaysian and Thai parliaments, as well as observers from Australia, also participated in the talks.

After the talks, Miguel Romulo, leader of the Philippine congressional delegation and vice-chairman of the Philippine House of Representatives Committee on Personnel, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: "This meeting was very successful."

He said that during the talks, the Philippine side reiterated the stance taken by President Corazon Aquino during her visit to China last year, when she told Chinese Premier Li Peng that the Philippines would continue to adhere to the "One China" policy in its trade relations with Taiwan. Romulo said that the "Reciprocal Trade Act with Taiwan" bill, proposed by some congressmen, is currently only being discussed within the scope of a subcommittee of the House of Representatives. He believed that there was no need to propose this bill because the Philippine Congress firmly supports the government's "One China" policy.

Romulo said that the Malaysian representative who participated in the talks stated that the Malaysian government adheres to the "One China" policy and firmly believes that Taiwan is a part of China. The representative also said that Malaysia views recent events in Beijing as purely China's internal affairs and that Malaysia will not interfere.

Ma Yong, leader of the Chinese observer delegation and vice-chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, told reporters after the talks that this meeting was fruitful and beneficial for promoting bilateral understanding and friendship between China and other countries. He also elaborated on China's domestic and foreign policies, as well as China's stance on the Cambodian issue and other international issues to the attending representatives from various countries. He stressed that China's current policy of reform and opening up will not change.

    菲国会代表团团长重申
    坚持“一个中国”政策
    新华社马尼拉8月23日电  正在这里出席东盟国会组织第10届会议的中国观察员代表团今天同与会的菲律宾国会代表团举行会谈，双方就双边关系以及共同关心的地区和国际问题交换了意见。
    与会的马来西亚、泰国议会代表和澳大利亚观察员代表团也参加了会谈。
    会谈结束后，菲律宾国会代表团团长、菲国会人事委员会副主席米盖·罗梅洛对新华社记者说：“这次会谈很成功”。
    他说，在会谈中，菲律宾方面重申了科·阿基诺总统去年访华时向中国总理李鹏表明的立场，即菲律宾在与台湾进行贸易往来时，将一如既往地坚持“一个中国”的政策。罗梅洛说，目前，由一些议员提议的《对台关系互惠法》法案仅限于在国会小组委员会范围内讨论。他认为提出这个法案是没有必要的，因为菲律宾国会坚持支持政府关于“一个中国”的政策。
    罗梅洛说，参加会谈的马来西亚代表在发言时表示，马来西亚政府奉行“一个中国”的政策，坚持认为台湾只是中国的一部分。这位代表还说，马来西亚认为北京最近发生的事情纯属中国内政，马来西亚不会进行干预。
    中国观察员代表团团长、全国人大外事委员会副主任姚广在会谈后对记者说，这次会谈是富于成果的，有益于促进中国与其他国家的双边理解和友谊。他还向与会的各国代表阐述了中国的对内、对外政策，以及中国在柬埔寨和其他国际问题上的立场，并表示中国现行的改革开放政策不会改变。
