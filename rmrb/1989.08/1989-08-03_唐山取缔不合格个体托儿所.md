Tangshan Shuts Down Unqualified Private Kindergartens

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang, August 2nd, (Trainee reporter Wang Yujuan, Reporter Zheng Zhanguo) Recently, Tangshan City in Hebei Province has shut down a number of unqualified private kindergartens.

There are 22 private kindergartens in the Luobei District of this city. Recently, the district government conducted an inspection and found that 13 of them were unqualified. Some kindergartens had more than 20 children crammed into a single room. Some did not maintain proper hygiene, leading to frequent cases of diarrhea and dysentery among the children. What is even more surprising is that more than half of the caregivers were illiterate.

The Luobei District Government has recently shut down these 13 unqualified private kindergartens and has also rectified the remaining 9.

    唐山取缔不合格个体托儿所
    据新华社石家庄8月2日电　（实习生王玉娟、记者郑战国）河北省唐山市最近取缔一批不合格的个体托儿所。
    这个市路北区共有22家个体托儿所。不久前区政府检查发现竟有13家不合格。有的托儿所20多个孩子挤在一间民房里。有的不讲卫生，致使孩子们经常闹肠炎、痢疾；尤其使人惊奇的是，保育员中竟有半数以上是文盲。
    路北区政府最近已经取缔了这13家个体托儿所，对剩下的9家也进行了整顿。
