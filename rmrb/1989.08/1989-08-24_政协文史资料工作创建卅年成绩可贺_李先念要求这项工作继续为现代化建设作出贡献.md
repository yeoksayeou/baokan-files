The work of collecting and publishing historical and literary materials by the CPPCC has achieved remarkable results over the past 30 years. Li Xiannian has called for this work to continue contributing to the modernization drive.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beidaihe on August 24, reporters learned from the meeting of the heads of the CPPCC Historical and Literary Materials Committees from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, which began today in Beidaihe, that over the past 30 years, the work of collecting and publishing historical and literary materials has gathered tens of billions of characters of materials related to politics, military affairs, economy, science and technology, culture, education, ethnic minorities, religion, and overseas Chinese. It has published over two billion characters and compiled more than 600 selections and thematic materials. As part of the CPPCC's work, the collection and publication of historical and literary materials have increasingly become an important aspect of the CPPCC's efforts to unite and connect people from all walks of life, to conduct patriotic and revolutionary tradition education among the people, and to provide materials for the study of China's modern and contemporary history.

In a congratulatory message to the meeting, Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, said that the counterrevolutionary riot in Beijing has left us with many issues that require serious consideration. Deng Xiaoping has pointed out that the biggest mistake in the past decade was the relaxation of ideological and political education for the people. The content of education is multifaceted, and its forms are varied. Among these, using historical facts for education, allowing the people to recognize the truth through specific and vivid facts, is a very good method. Over the past 30 years, the historical and literary materials departments have collected and published a large amount of materials, which have played a significant role in helping people understand the history of modern China, the struggle of the Chinese people over the past century to save the nation, and the truth that without the Communist Party there would be no new China, only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China. These materials have also provided historical lessons for China's economic construction and reform and opening-up work. Li Xiannian hopes that the work of collecting and publishing historical and literary materials by the CPPCC will make greater contributions to the socialist modernization drive in the new historical period.

Sun Xiaocun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the CPPCC Historical and Literary Materials Committee, reviewed the achievements of the CPPCC's historical and literary materials work in the past and proposed tasks for the future. Zhang Youyi and Yang Chengwu, who had previously served as Chairmen of the CPPCC Historical and Literary Materials Committee, attended the meeting and spoke.

    政协文史资料工作创建卅年成绩可贺
    李先念要求这项工作继续为现代化建设作出贡献
    据新华社北戴河8月24日电　（记者胡清海）记者从今天在北戴河开始举行的各省、自治区、直辖市政协文史资料委员会主任会议上获悉：政协文史资料工作创建30年来，已征集了十几亿字的政治、军事、经济、科技、文教、民族、宗教、华侨等方面的资料，出版了两亿多字，编印了600多种选辑和专题资料。作为人民政协工作组成部分的文史资料工作，正在日益成为政协团结联系各界爱国人士，对人民群众进行爱国主义和革命传统教育，为研究我国近现代历史提供素材的重要工作。
    全国政协主席李先念给会议写的贺信说，北京发生的反革命暴乱，留给我们许多需要认真思考的问题。邓小平同志曾经讲到，10年最大的失误是放松了对人民的思想政治教育。教育的内容是多方面的，形式也是多种多样的。其中，用历史事实进行教育，让人民群众通过具体的活生生的事实认识真理，是一个很好的办法。30年来，文史部门征集和出版了大量的资料，对于帮助人们了解近现代中国的历史，了解中国人民近百年来救亡图存的奋斗，了解没有共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义才能救中国，也只有社会主义才能发展中国的道理，起了很好的作用，做出了很大的成绩。文史资料还为我国经济建设和改革开放工作提供了历史的借鉴。李先念希望政协文史资料工作在新的历史时期为社会主义现代化建设作出更大贡献。
    全国政协副主席、全国政协文史资料委员会主任孙晓村在会上回顾了政协文史工作在过去取得的成绩，并提出了今后工作的任务。曾经担任过全国政协文史资料委员会主任的张友渔、杨成武出席了会议并讲了话。
