	Shanxi Investigates and Punishes Case of Reselling Poverty Alleviation Vehicles
	Fifteen People Held Criminally Liable; Over 900,000 Yuan Seized and Fined

	TAIYUAN, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- The case of reselling poverty alleviation vehicles in Shanxi Province's Lvliang Region has finally been resolved. Fifteen people involved in the case have been held criminally liable.

	In early 1988, the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas and the State Bureau of Materials, at a discounted price of 15% to 30% off, allocated 377 various types of trucks to Lvliang Region to support its economic development. However, some leading cadres violated the principles of vehicle allocation, using these poverty alleviation vehicles for personal gain rather than for poverty alleviation. Out of the 377 trucks, 107 were used for personal favors or resold for profit, causing a negative impact.

	The Jiaokou County Materials Company, upon receiving the poverty alleviation vehicles at the Tianjin port, resold 10 "Tatral" brand trucks at a markup of 20,000 yuan each to the Pingyi County Electrical and Mechanical Company in Shandong Province, earning an illegal profit of 200,000 yuan. The deputy manager of the Jiaokou County Materials Company, Zhao Zuoyi, also extorted 4,300 yuan from Pingyi County Electrical and Mechanical Company. Additionally, Pingyi County Electrical and Mechanical Company gave an extra 10,000 yuan to Jiaokou County Materials Company.

	The deputy county magistrates Zhang Douyou and Zhang Guojun of Lishi County, along with some section-level cadres, privately allocated 56 poverty alleviation vehicles to their acquaintances and relatives. The director of the Lan County Materials Bureau, Du Ruzhen, used the opportunity to take friends and relatives on a sightseeing trip, spending over 15,000 yuan. Upon return, four cadres each received a daily allowance of 1476 yuan.

	Last December, Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily publicly exposed this matter, drawing the attention of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Lvliang Regional Committee. The Lvliang Region, led by the executive vice governor, organized 700 people over 10 months, overcoming difficulties and breaking through obstacles, to finally uncover this major case. The 107 resold trucks were each marked up by an average of 5,971 yuan, totaling over 630,000 yuan in illegal profits. The highest profit from a single truck resale was 31,000 yuan.

	This case involved 66 people, including 26 party members. Those who violated the law have been handed over to public security and procuratorial organs for criminal liability, with 3 people being arrested. The industrial and commercial administration has recovered illegal profits and fines totaling 983,000 yuan. The disciplinary and supervisory departments are currently handling the other 48 cadres and workers who made mistakes.

    山西查处倒卖扶贫车案
    十五人被追究刑事责任  没收并罚款九十多万元
    本报太原8月4日电　记者王艾生、新华社记者张怀京报道：震动山西省的吕梁地区倒卖扶贫汽车案件，7月31日终于水落石出，涉及此案的15人被追究刑事责任。
    1988年初，国务院贫困地区经济发展领导小组和国家物资总局，以每台少收15％至30％的优惠价，拨给山西省吕梁地区各类载重汽车377辆，扶持吕梁地区开发经济。但是，担任领导工作的某些干部违反汽车分配原则，扶贫车不扶贫，这批卡车有107辆被用于徇私舞弊，或转手倒卖，牟取暴利，影响极坏。
    交口县物资公司在天津口岸接扶贫车时，以每辆加价2万元，将10辆“太脱拉”牌载重汽车，就地转手倒卖给山东省平邑县机电公司，从中牟取暴利20万元。该公司副经理赵作义还向平邑县机电公司索贿4300元，平邑县机电公司额外给交口县物资公司1万元。
    离石县副县长张都有、张国俊和一些科级干部，把国家分配的56辆扶贫汽车，私分给了他们的熟人和亲朋好友。岚县物资局局长杜汝珍，借接扶贫车之机带亲朋好友游山玩水，挥霍1.5万余元，回来后4个干部又按每人每天16元领取补助费1476元。
    去年底，新华社、人民日报公开披露此事，引起中共山西省委和吕梁地委重视。吕梁地区由行署专员负责，组织700余人，历时10个月，克服困难，冲破阻力，终于查清这一大案。被倒卖的107辆汽车，平均每辆加价5971元，共非法获利63万余元，最高一辆汽车倒卖后获利3.1万元。
    此案共涉及66人，其中党员26人。触犯法律的人员，有15人被移送公安、检察机关追究其刑事责任，3人被依法逮捕。工商行政部门已收回非法获利和罚款98.3万余元。纪检和监察部门正对其他犯有错误的48名干部、职工，做出相应的处理。
