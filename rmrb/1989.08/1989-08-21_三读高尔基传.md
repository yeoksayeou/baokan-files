A person's life is very short, and in the blink of an eye, several decades pass. It is rare for a book to be read, re-read, and read a third time over several decades, but it does happen. For me, this is the case with "The Revolutionary Writer Gorky" edited and translated by Zhou Tiaofen. This book covers Gorky's life from his birth (1868) to 1932, detailing his 40 years of literary activity comprehensively, vividly, and truthfully. Although Gorky passed away four years later, this book can still be considered his biography.

Zhou Tiaofen edited and translated this book in 1933 based on "Gorky and His Russia" by Professor Cohn of the University of California, and some parts were collected by the editor and translator. Therefore, it contains many materials that were rarely seen by later generations, which is very valuable. For example, Gorky himself once frankly said, "He had never formally joined any political party. In the revolutionary movement, he was only a 'sympathizer'—of course, a very active 'sympathizer'—using his time, his pen, his money, and his personal freedom (under continuous police surveillance, repeatedly imprisoned) to support the Russian revolutionary movement. It is said that he used less than 30% of his income for himself, and the rest was used to support various revolutionary organizations," which is something that most people do not know.

The circumstances of my reading this book three times are as follows:

The first time was in the spring and summer of 1943 at the detention center of the Garrison Command in Chongqing. In early 1943, when it was still snowing, the bookstore I opened in Fuling City, Sichuan, was suspected by the Nationalist authorities of being an underground base of the Communist Party of China (which was obviously a groundless suspicion). The bookstore had to close, and I returned to Chongqing to work as an assistant editor at the Southern Publishing House. A few months later, I was arrested. This detention center was a rare prison in the world. In one room, dozens of prisoners were detained, with straw mats laid out in two rows on the ground, leaving a narrow path in the middle. The prisoners were crammed together on both sides; in the innermost part, in the middle, there was a chamber pot. The urine and feces of these dozens of people were all excreted into it. The chamber pot was emptied once a day, and when it was full, it overflowed, with urine flowing all over the place, soaking the prisoners' straw mats, bedding, and clothes. The detention center had an unwritten rule: prisoners entering the center would first stay by the chamber pot, and when someone left, they would move forward. When I entered the center, I was staying by the chamber pot. The smell was much worse than that of a toilet because the toilet was at least at a certain distance from people. However, after staying for a while, it became tolerable. It was here that someone brought a copy of "The Revolutionary Writer Gorky" and begged to borrow it to read. It was here that I first read this book. While reading, I was emotionally stirred, my soul flew to Russia, and I followed Gorky's footsteps, traveling through the villages and towns of Russia, from an apprentice in a drawing studio and an icon shop to a night watchman and a baker, learning, thinking, wandering, writing, and fighting. I felt extremely gratified and left a very deep impression. After finishing the book, I returned it to the person who lent it to me. Although I do not know his name, I will forever be grateful to this person.

Eight years later, in March 1951, I joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's battlefield cultural service team to work in the Korean battlefield. At that time, the people of our country donated many books to the volunteer army. We organized company libraries for the soldiers to read in Korea, and later, we summarized the experience and wrote a small booklet titled "How to Establish a Company Library," which was printed and distributed. Sometimes, the unit was very busy, and the soldiers did not have time to read, so we were relatively free and could read books. It was in late July 1951 that I read this book for the second time on the Korean battlefield. At that time, I was staying in the home of a Korean farmer. Korean farmhouses all have a custom of taking off shoes upon entering, with mats laid out on the kang (a heated brick bed). Some families have a small table, and people eat, work, and sleep on the kang. It was on this kang that I read the book. This book was donated by the masses and was probably an old edition. I cannot remember the version.

The third time was when I read the revised edition published by the Shanghai branch of Sanlian Bookstore in June 1987. This was the first book published by the store. The so-called revision only added a preface, illustrations, and footnotes where necessary, while "to respect his (Zhou Tiaofen's) original work, the entire text is printed according to the 6th edition of 1941, with no changes made" (Guo Baoguan, "Postscript to the New Edition"). This makes the book more complete, allowing readers today to generally understand its entire process of circulation in China.

Gorky is the most familiar great writer among the older generation of Chinese readers. Although his works were not read by everyone in the 1940s and 1950s, they were well-known; he, like Lu Xun, is a figure greatly admired by people, especially Gorky's lonely and hard childhood, youth, and early adulthood, which are deeply respected by millions of Chinese youth.

Gorky is the pride of the Soviet people. He always loved his country, his people, and the revolutionary cause. His life is closely connected with the suffering and rebirth of Russia. For this reason, I believe that the re-publication of this book is a precious gift for the young readers of my country.

    三读高尔基传
    刘岚山
    人的一生是很短促的，一转眼间几十年就过去了。一本书在几十年间能够初读、再读而三读的事很少，但总是有的。邹韬奋编译的《革命文豪高尔基》，对于我就是这样。这本书将高尔基从出生（1868）到1932年，即他从事文学活动的40年间，作了全面的、详细的、生动的、真实的叙述与描绘，虽然四年后高尔基去世了，但这本书仍可算做高尔基传。
    邹韬奋是1933年根据美国加利福尼亚大学俄国文学教授康恩的《高尔基和他的俄国》而编译的，有一些则是出于编译者的搜集，故有许多当时的材料为后来人们所少见，这是非常宝贵的。例如高尔基自己曾经很坦白地说过，“他从未正式加入任何政党。在革命运动里面，他不过是一个‘同情者’——当然是一个很积极的‘同情者’——用了他的时间，他的笔，他的金钱和他的个人的自由（受到继续不断的警察监视，屡次入狱），来赞助俄国的革命运动，据说他的收入，自己用去的不到30％，其余的都用于赞助各种的革命团体”等等，就是一般人很少知道的。
    我三读这本书的情况是这样的：
    第一次是1943年春夏之交在重庆卫戍司令部稽查处拘留所里。因为1943年初，天还落着雪的时候，我在四川涪陵城内开设的山野书店，被国民党当局怀疑为中国共产党的地下据点（这当然是想入非非），书店不得不关门，我回到重庆，在南方印书馆编译部做助理编辑，几个月后就被捕了。这个拘留所是世界上罕见的监狱，一间房子里关押着五六十个犯人，地上分两排铺着稻草，中间留一条路，犯人们个挨个地挤在两边；最里边的中间放着一只尿桶，这五六十人的尿屎都拉在里面，尿桶一天倒一次，满了就溢出来，满地流淌，沾湿着犯人的铺草、铺盖和衣服。拘留所有个不成文的规矩：犯人入所，先住在尿桶边，有人走了就向前移，我入所时就是住在尿桶边的。那种气味比厕所要难闻多了，因为厕所毕竟与人有一定距离。然而住久了，也就无所谓了。就是在这里，有人带来一本《革命文豪高尔基》，乞求着借来一读。我就是在这里第一次读这本书的。在读的过程中，我感情澎湃，魂飞俄罗斯，沿着高尔基的足迹，走遍俄国的大小乡村和城镇，从绘图师、神像店的学徒到守夜的阍人和糕饼店的师傅，学习、思考、漂泊、流浪，写作、斗争。我感到异常的欣慰，留下了极为深刻的印象。书读完就还给借给我书的那人，我虽不知道他的姓名，但我永远感激这个人。
    8年后，即1951年3月，我参加中国人民志愿军战地文化服务队赴朝鲜战地工作。那时，祖国人民捐赠了许多图书给志愿军，我们在朝鲜战地组织连队图书室给战士阅读，后来还总结经验，由我编写成一本《怎样建立连队图书室》小册子印发下去。有时候，部队很忙，战士没有时间看书，我们就比较清闲，可以看看书，我就是1951年7月下旬在朝鲜战地第二次读这本书的。当时住在朝鲜老乡家中，朝鲜农家都是一进门就脱鞋，炕上铺着席子，有的人家有张小桌子，人就在地炕上吃饭、做活、睡觉，我就是在这种炕上读书的。这本书是群众捐赠的，已经记不得版次了，大概总是一本旧书吧。
    第三次就是最近读的1987年6月由三联书店上海分店出版的修订本，这是该店出版的第一本书，所谓修订，只不过增加了序跋、插图和在必要的地方加了脚注，而“为了尊重他（邹韬奋）的原著，全文按1941年第6版排印，未加任何改动”（戈宝权《新版校订后记》）。这样就使本书更加齐全，令现在的读者大体能够了解它在中国流传的全过程。
    高尔基在老一代中国读者中是最为熟悉的伟大作家，他的作品在四五十年代虽不是人人都读过，但却是众所周知的；他同鲁迅一样是人们最为景仰的人物，尤其是高尔基的孤苦伶仃的童年、少年、青年时期的经历，更为千千万万中国青年所敬重。
    高尔基是苏联人民的骄傲，他始终热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱革命事业，他的一生是与俄罗斯的苦难和新生相连结的。正因为这样，这本书的重新出版，我以为对我国青年读者是一份贵重的礼物。
