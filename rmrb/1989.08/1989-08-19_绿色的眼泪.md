Green eyes, large and small, long and round, very beautiful. They are the eyes of a young girl.

"Mom, why does the big poplar tree have eyes?"

"To see the world."

I was also surprised. I looked at her, and she looked at me.

Four rows of neatly aligned poplar trees stood tall on both sides of the road. After dinner, we would walk under the poplars. The cool breeze washed away the heat, making it very comfortable. The children played hide and seek around the trees, and the poplar eyes also laughed merrily. Those eyes were full of joy, innocence, and carefreeness, like someone who had done a good deed and was shyly smiling, a modest and gentle smile, with a gentle and pure green light in their gaze.

Every time a branch was pruned, a green eye would grow on the trunk. The trunk grew straight up, taller than the six-story buildings.

When they were happy, they would also playfully tease people. Several times, I heard the sound of rain, pattering loudly, and I was about to take cover. Suddenly, I looked up, and the blue sky was sparkling at the treetops, white clouds were drifting among the branches, and the golden glow of the sunset was flashing on the leaves. It turned out that the leaves were rustling in the wind, like many children clapping and laughing. Listening to the rain was very interesting. I admired Ouyang Xiu's "Autumn Colors" as a timeless classic, and sometimes I would deliberately close my eyes, imagining the sudden rain and the heroic spirit of clashing swords and horses.

Talking with these green eyes, enjoying their generous gifts, the fatigue of the day disappeared. They became indispensable friends every day.

Suddenly, one day, the poplar trees were felled, and the screeching sound of the saw was heart-wrenching. The saw teeth gnawed at the thick trunks, and the sap oozing out was their blood.

I hoped that new saplings would be planted in their place. The eyes that had not been felled were also hoping, radiating a gaze of hope amidst despair and sorrow.

But years passed, and what emerged from the ground were still tree stumps. The sawed-off cross-sections were uneven, weathered by snow and frost, trampled by feet and animals, the wood grain blurred, and had turned black. Some were buried in the soil, and the rotting traces were vaguely visible. If you dug them out, you would see red-brown wood fragments, like congealed blood clots. My heart trembled.

I counted, 42 stumps. Some of the surrounding concrete blocks proved that there used to be a poplar tree here, with the roots covered by the stalls of shoe sellers or the wheels of tea vendors.

The city was expanding outward. Originally, a hundred meters away was a forest and fields, but now the forest had disappeared, and the fields retreated four kilometers away. This place became a bustling market. The road was filled with cars and horses, dust flying, horns and bells competing, and the blue smoke from car exhausts swirled, forming a noisy and polluted torrent...

The vegetable sellers and various street vendors also crowded in, making the road narrower and narrower, and congestion was common.

Since the poplar trees were felled, we no longer came here for a walk because it was too dirty and chaotic, with rotten vegetable leaves and roots in the dust, and urine at the walls at night...

There were 34 poplar trees left, though they had grown a few more years, but they were not in good condition. Two more had already died, and in the spring, there were no new leaves on the branches, only iron-like dead branches reaching towards the sky, venting their deep sorrow. Two more had only a few scattered green leaves on the small branches around their waists, and the eyes on the trunks had a dying expression...

The surviving eyes had long lost their vitality, filled with sorrow and despair. Some were crying, with large tears flowing down the trunk, long and endless; some were bleeding, blurry and ready to die...

The pure, carefree, and vibrant laughter of theirs could no longer be seen.

Around them, people were haggling and arguing:

"Have you no conscience?"

"The price is high, but it's not enough!"

They saw deceit, bare-faced quarrels, naked self-interest, and money transactions. There was no longer freshness, tranquility, and purity here.

The green eyes turned into gray scars.

    绿色的眼泪
    张惠芳
    绿色的眼睛，大大小小的，长长圆圆的，很美丽。是少女的眼。
    “妈妈，大杨树为什么长眼睛？”
    “为了看世界。”
    我也惊奇，我看着她，她也看着我。
    四排整整齐齐的白杨挺挺地站立在路两旁。晚饭后，我们来白杨下散步，清凉的微风洗去燥热，很惬意。孩子们绕着树捉迷藏，白杨的眼睛也在嘻嘻地笑。那眼睛是欢乐、天真、无忧无虑的，如同做了好事而腼腆地笑，是羞涩恬静的笑，目光中荡漾着温柔清纯的绿色。
    每逢削掉一枝，树干上就长出一只绿眼睛，那树干直楞楞地往上长，直高过了六层楼房。
    她们高兴时，还狡黠地逗人。有几次，忽听雨声大作，哔哔啦啦，真要躲雨了，猛抬头，蓝天在树梢上闪烁，白云在枝间飘悠，晚霞的金辉在叶面上一亮一亮的，原来是叶们在风中喧闹，好像许多孩子在拍手笑。听雨，很有意思。我佩服欧阳修《秋色赋》谱成千古绝唱，有时也故意闭上眼睛，想像那骤雨忽至，金戈铁马的气概。
    和这绿色眼睛谈心，享受着她们的慷慨赐予，一天的劳顿消散了。她们成了每天不可缺少的朋友。
    忽一日，一株株白杨倒下了，那嘶嘶啦啦的锯声揪心裂肺，锯齿向粗壮的树干啃咬着，沁出的液汁是她们的血。
    我盼着在她们倒下的地方再栽上新苗儿。没有倒下的眼睛也在期待着，放射着失望悲怆中的 希望的目光。
    可是，几年过去了，露出地面的仍是树墩，锯掉的横断面凸凹不平，雪压霜欺，脚踢畜踩，木纹模糊，已变成黑色。有的埋在土里，那沤糟了的痕迹隐约可见，扒一扒，露出红赭色的木的碎片，像冷凝了的血块。我的心颤抖了。
    数了数，树墩42。有的从周围砌的水泥方块可考证这里曾是一株白杨，根上铺着掌鞋者的生意摊，或压着卖茶人的车轮子。
    城市在向外扩展，原先百米外就是林地麦田，现在林地消失了，麦田退到4公里外。这里变成了闹市。路上车水马龙，尘土飞扬，喇叭声、车铃声争先恐后，汽车尾气的蓝烟团团缭绕，汇成嘈杂污浊的洪流……卖菜的和各种小摊小贩也挤上来，路越挤越窄，梗阻是常见的。
    自从白杨树被锯倒后，我们再也不来散步，因为这里太脏太乱，尘土里有腐烂的菜叶菜根，墙根夜里还有人撒尿……
    白杨树还剩34株，虽多长了几年，但很不精神。又有两株已死去，春来，再没见那枝头发出新叶，只剩铁似的枯枝刺向天空，发泄满腔悲愤。还有两株只腰部的小枝还挂着零星几片绿叶，那树干的眼睛，神色是垂死的……
    活下来的那一只只大眼睛早没了生气，忧郁、失望，有的在流泪，泪滴大大的，顺着树干往下流，很长，很长；有的在流血，模糊一片，准备着去死……
    再也看不到她们的笑，那纯真的、无忧无虑的、生机勃勃的笑。
    在她们身边，人们在讨价还价，在叫骂：
    “你良心狗吃了？”
    “价钱高还不够秤！”
    她们看到了尔虞我诈、撕破脸皮，赤裸裸的坑人利己、金钱交易。这里没有了清新、宁静和纯真。
    绿色的眼睛变成了灰色的伤疤。
