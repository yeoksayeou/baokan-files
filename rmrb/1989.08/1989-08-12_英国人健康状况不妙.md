The Royal College of Physicians in Britain recently conducted a survey revealing that Britain is currently one of the industrialized nations with the poorest health conditions. A report from the survey indicates that Britain has the highest mortality rates for heart disease and lung cancer among industrialized nations. The infant mortality rate is also higher than in other European countries, and the work on preventing and treating diseases ranks last among Western European nations. Therefore, the medical college has called on all British people to pay attention to their health and strive to improve Britain's health situation by the year 2000. Experts have urged citizens to adopt scientific diets and quit smoking, believing that these measures could save thousands of lives each year.

Experts have pointed out that more than half of Britain's annual traffic accidents are caused by drunk driving, and they have called for people to reduce their alcohol consumption. Experts have also urged the government, businesses, and trade unions to pay more attention to the health of citizens, hoping to see a "healthy Britain" in the next century.

    英国人健康状况不妙
    据英国皇家医学院最近所作的一项调查，眼下英国属于工业国家中国民健康状况最糟的国家之一。一份调查报告称，英国的心脏病及肺癌死亡率在工业国家中是最高的，婴儿死亡率也高于其他欧洲国家，而疾病防治工作在西欧诸国列倒数第一。因此，该医学院要求所有英国人关心自己的健康，并努力使英国在2000年前摆脱“健康困境”。专家们呼吁公民采用科学食谱和戒烟，认为此举每年能减少数以千计公民的早逝。
    专家们指出英国每年的交通事故有一半以上是酒后驾车引起的，要求人们节酒。专家们还敦促政府、企业界和工会对公民的健康问题予以更多的重视，期望在下一世纪出现一个令人刮目相看的“健康的英国”。
