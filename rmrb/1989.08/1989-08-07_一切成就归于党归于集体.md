The International Technology and Technology Exchange Conference and the International Institute of Technology awarded me a medal and title this year, recognizing my work in "China's rocket and missile technology, aerospace technology, and systems engineering theory." I think the two characters "China" are indispensable and very important. Reflecting on my journey, I went to the United States in 1935 and returned to China in 1955, spending 20 years in the U.S. For the first three or four years, I was studying, and for the next ten or so years, I was working. All of this was preparation for returning to my homeland to serve the people. During my 20 years in the United States, I never thought about staying there for the rest of my life. I have reasons for saying this. In the United States, once a person starts working, they usually save part of their income in an insurance company for retirement. During my time in the U.S., people asked me several times if I had saved any insurance money, and I said I hadn't saved a single dollar. They found this strange. Actually, there was nothing strange about it because I am Chinese and had no intention of living in the United States forever.

By 1950, I learned about the founding of New China and felt that the opportunity had come to return to my homeland. However, the ruling class in the United States was hostile to the Chinese people and created numerous obstacles to prevent me from returning, causing me to stay for an additional five years. I vividly remember that on August 1, 1955, Sino-American ambassadorial talks began in Geneva. Wang Bingshan, representing the Chinese government, conducted negotiations and struggles with the U.S. representatives according to the instructions of Premier Zhou. Thus, on August 5, I received a notice from the U.S. government that I could return to China. Of course, I was deported as a prisoner of the United States, escorted back to China. Along the way, I was not allowed to disembark because once I did, the U.S. government would no longer be responsible for my safety. This segment of history, I will never forget. It made me deeply understand what imperialism is and what American "democracy" and "freedom" are like. Therefore, I have deep feelings for the Communist Party of China. I remember when the ship arrived in Manila, a United Press reporter came on board to interview me. He asked if I was a Communist, and I replied, "I am not yet qualified to be a Communist Party member. Communists are people with the highest ideals of humanity." He heard my answer and did not dare to ask a second question, slinking away.

After returning to my homeland, I felt overjoyed and hoped to start working as soon as possible. However, the leadership instructed me to visit various places first. Initially, I went to the Northeast to visit the Military Engineering Academy in Harbin. The academy's commander, General Chen Gong, specially returned from Beijing to Harbin to meet me. His first question was, "Can the Chinese develop missiles?" I replied, "If foreigners can do it, why can't the Chinese?" General Chen said, "Good! That's the spirit." Little did I know that this one sentence determined my lifelong career in rockets, missiles, and aerospace. Looking back now, although I boldly said we could develop missiles, the actual challenges were immense. Because New China had just been established, the economic and technological conditions were far from what they are today. However, we successfully developed atomic bombs and missiles, and did so at a rapid pace. The reason? I believe the most important factor was the Party's leadership. Specifically, it was the personal leadership of Premier Zhou Enlai and the organizational efforts of Marshal Nie Rongzhen. We, the comrades present, all cherish that era. In my experience, Premier Zhou and Marshal Nie applied the methods they used to organize large-scale military operations during the War of Liberation to scientific and technological work, mobilizing tens of thousands of scientific and technological personnel. Therefore, despite the many difficulties we faced in economics and technology, we were able to achieve success quickly due to effective organization and leadership.

Reflecting on this history, I feel that individuals have only done a little of what they should have done, which is very limited. If we talk about achievements, we should first attribute them to the Party's leadership and secondly to the efforts of the broad masses of scientific and technological personnel. In the field of missile and aerospace technology, it was initially the old Fifth Academy, followed by the Seventh Machine Industry Department, the Aerospace Industry Department, and now the Aerospace Industry Department. It is the collective effort of tens of thousands of scientific and technological personnel in this field. Compared to the Party's leadership and the collective's strength, an individual's contribution is very small. Just looking at my work, it can fully illustrate this point. Premier Zhou and Marshal Nie gave me this task, and my approach was to rely on the collective. I remember that every Sunday afternoon, I would invite several chief designers, including Ren Xinmin, Tu Shouti, Huang Weilu, Liang Shupan, and Zhuang Fenggan, as well as Comrade Lin Shuang, to my home to discuss matters. We would raise any issues and solve them together. Different opinions should be fully expressed, but once a decision is made, it must be executed. If any mistakes are found during execution, they should be corrected as soon as possible. Our Chinese missiles were developed this way. Therefore, the achievements belong to the collective, including the Aerospace Industry Department, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission (then called the National Defense Science Commission), various test bases, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and various relevant departments of the State Council. At that time, it was called national cooperation, and all relevant units made contributions. Therefore, today's award to me, saying it is the first time a Chinese has received this award, I say the key is the three characters "Chinese people." This "Chinese people" should include the tens of thousands of people who have made contributions to this.

As for systems engineering, it is not the achievement of one person. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, many people realized the importance of systems engineering and began research in this area, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University. Therefore, even the contributions in the field of systems engineering theory are the result of everyone's collective efforts. This is why I believe that the words "China's rocket and missile technology, aerospace technology, and systems engineering theory" in the award document from the International Technology and Technology Exchange Conference and the International Institute of Technology are the most important. It should be an honor for all the people in China who have made contributions to this.

On the other hand, I must point out that on the day Ambassador Han Xu represented me to receive the award, June 29, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment to "sanction" China. They distorted the facts, maliciously slandering and attacking the just stance and necessary measures taken by the Chinese government to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Their actions, along with the performances of "Voice of America" and others, tell us that class struggle has not been extinguished. Today, broadcasts and newspapers say that Marshal Nie wrote a letter to comfort the martial law troops, mentioning that we should not forget class struggle. There is still imperialism in the international arena, and there are still a few class enemies within the country, so how can we say there is no class struggle?

Of course, international affairs are complex. The International Technology and Technology Exchange Conference awarded me this prize after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, indicating that they are still friendly. The American people are friendly to the Chinese people, and I have deeply felt this. Even during the period from 1950 to 1955 when the U.S. government was persecuting me, many American friends comforted me and went to great lengths to help me solve difficulties, showing me true friendship. Until the very end, when we boarded the ship to leave the United States, they organized a welcoming team on the shore to see us off. This is my personal experience. I have a good American friend, Professor William Sears. A few years ago, he came to China, and I visited him. He saw many American businessmen in his residence and, upon seeing me, said, "These people come to China to cut your flesh, be careful." He is an American, but he warned us not to be deceived. This is the true friend of China in America. Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin, in his meeting with our ambassadors abroad, said that we should use the two-point theory, that is, in foreign relations, we should talk about both economics and politics; both friendship and struggle; both principles and strategies. I think this is very correct. We must oppose the leftist slogan of "class struggle as the key link," and at the same time, we must oppose the theory of the extinction of class struggle. We should remember Comrade Jiang Zemin's two-point theory.

We are engaged in scientific and technological work, but we must also consider economic and political issues. I often discuss this with Comrade Zhu Guangya, who works with me. In such a complex situation, the Party and the state have given us, some scientific and technological workers, important responsibilities, asking us to serve as scientific and technological advisors. This is not a simple matter. At that time, we were developing missiles and artificial satellites, and the tasks were relatively clear and specific—we just had to do it. It was not a matter of choosing directions or paths; the general direction and paths had already been decided by the Party Central Committee. However, now, when we engage in scientific and technological work, especially in high technology, there are expert committees or expert groups. I deeply feel that the position of the group leader is not easy because now, scientific and technological competition in the world is so fierce, it is a technological war, an intelligence war. Choosing what to do, what not to do, and how to do it, if the advice given by experts is a bit off, the country will suffer great losses. Therefore, the responsibility of the chief scientist is much heavier and more complex than ours at that time. Only a scientific and technological strategist can do it! Therefore, we must especially pay attention to cultivating young successors. I estimate that we need about 200 such people, and these 200 people are crucial. They must be scientific and technological experts who also understand dialectical materialism, can use the two-point theory to analyze problems, and understand the complex situation in the world. Only then can the plans they design not go wrong and achieve victory. This is a bit of our experience in developing large-scale systems engineering and attacking cutting-edge technologies under the leadership of Zhou Enlai and Nie Rongzhen at the National Defense Science and Technology Commission. The leaders of the Science and Technology Commission of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission probably have to bear this responsibility. I am a bit older, so I can only serve as a senior advisor to the Science and Technology Commission of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission. I am very unworthy of the encouragement from everyone, but I am not discouraged and will continue to do my best for the construction of Chinese socialism.

    一切成就归于党归于集体
    钱学森
    国际技术与技术交流大会、国际理工研究所今年授予我奖章和称号，说是表彰我“对中国火箭导弹技术、航天技术和系统工程理论”方面所做的一些工作。我想这里面“中国”两个字是不可缺少的，是非常重要的。因为回想起来，我从1935年去美国，1955年回国，在美国呆了20年。20年中，前三、四年是学习，后十几年是工作，所有这一切都是在做准备，为了回到祖国后能为人民做点事。我在美国那么长时间，从来没想过这辈子要在那里呆下去。我这么说是有根据的。因为在美国，一个人一参加工作，总要把他的一部分收入存入保险公司，以备晚年退休之后用。在美国期间，有人好几次问我存了保险金没有，我说一块美元也不存，他们听了感到奇怪。其实没什么奇怪的，因为我是中国人，根本不打算在美国住一辈子。到1950年我得知新中国成立，认为机会到了，应该回到祖国去。但是美国的统治阶级与中国人民为敌，制造了种种麻烦，阻止我回国，使我多呆了5年。我清楚记得，1955年8月1日中美大使级会谈在日内瓦开始，王炳南大使代表中国政府参加会谈，他按照周总理的旨意，与美方代表进行了交涉和斗争，于是我在8月5日即接到美国政府的通知，说我可以回国。当然，我是作为美国的犯人，被驱逐出境，押送回国的。一路上我不能下船，因为一下船，美国政府对我的安全就不负责任了。这一段历史，我决不会忘记，它使我深深懂得了什么叫帝国主义，我也领教了美国的“民主”和“自由”，深知美国的“民主”是什么样子。所以我对中国共产党是怀有深厚感情的。记得船到马尼拉，有一个美联社记者到船上来找我。问我是不是共产党，我的回答是：“我还不够格做一名共产党员呢！共产党人是具有人类最崇高理想的人。”他听了回答，没敢再问第二个问题，灰溜溜地跑了。
    回到祖国以后，我感到欢欣，希望早日投入工作，但领导上让我先到各地看看。开头是去东北，到哈尔滨参观军事工程学院，当时的院长陈赓大将专程从北京赶回哈尔滨接见我，他问我的第一句话是：“中国人搞导弹行不行？”我说：“外国人能干的，中国人为什么不能干？”陈赓大将说：“好！就要你这一句话。”谁知这一句话，决定了我这一生从事火箭、导弹和航天事业的生涯。现在回想起来，当时我冒说一句可以搞导弹，但是真正干起来，困难真多呀。因为新中国成立不久，从经济到技术，各方面的条件与现在比，相差是很远很远的。然而，原子弹、导弹，这两项尖端技术终于被我们攻克了，而且是以很快的速度搞成的。原因何在？我认为，最最重要的原因，是党的领导。具体地说，就是周恩来总理的亲自领导和聂荣臻元帅的具体组织。我们在座的同志都怀念那个时代。按照我的体会，周总理、聂老总就是把他们过去在解放战争中，组织大规模作战的那套办法，有效的用到科技工作中来，把成千上万的科技大军组织起来了。所以尽管我们在经济、技术上有许多困难，但由于组织领导有方，还是很快搞成了。
    回顾这一段历史，我觉得，个人只是尽力做了一点应该做的工作，那是很有限的。要说功劳的话，首先要归功于党的领导，第二是广大科技人员的努力。在导弹航天技术方面，那就是最初的老五院，以后是七机部、航天工业部，现在叫航空航天工业部，是这个领域成千上万科技人员的功劳，个人的贡献要是与党的领导和集体的力量相比，那是非常渺小的。仅就我的工作而言，也能完全说明这个问题。周总理、聂老总给我这个任务，我的办法就是依靠集体。记得那时，每个星期天下午，我就把任新民、屠守锷、黄纬禄、梁守槃、庄逢甘等几位总师，还有林爽同志请到我家去议事，有什么问题，大家提出来共同研究解决。不同的意见要尽量发表，但议定的事都要执行。执行中发现有什么差错，要尽快改正。我们中国的导弹，就是这么干出来的。所以成就是集体的，这包括航空航天工业部，国防科工委（那时叫国防科委），各试验基地，还有国家科委，中国科学院，国务院各部等有关协作单位。那时，叫全国大力协同，各有关单位都作出了贡献。因此，今天给我的奖，说是第一名中国人得此奖。我说，要紧的是“中国人”三个字，这个“中国人”，应该包括中国成千上万为此作出贡献的人。
    至于说到系统工程，那也不是我一个人的功劳。从十一届三中全会以后，许多人都感到系统工程的重要性，在做这方面的研究工作，包括中国科学院的，北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学的等。所以，就是系统工程理论方面的贡献，也是大家共同努力的结果。这就是为什么我认为国际技术与技术交流大会、国际理工研究所在授奖文件中所说的“对中国火箭导弹技术，航天技术和系统工程理论”方面的贡献这段文字中，“中国”两个字最重要的原因，应该表彰的是中国所有对此做出贡献的人们。
    另一方面，我要指出的是，韩叙大使代表我领奖的那一天是今年6月29日，就在这一天，美国国会参议院通过“制裁”中国的修正案，歪曲事实真相，对中国政府在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱中所采取的正义立场和必要措施，肆意进行污蔑和攻击，并提出一系列“制裁”的措施。他们的这一行为，还有“美国之音”等的一系列表演，都告诉我们，阶级斗争并没有熄灭。今天广播、报纸上说，聂老总写信慰问戒严部队，信中也说到不能忘记阶级斗争。现在国际上还存在帝国主义，国内还有一小撮阶级敌人，怎么能说没有阶级斗争呢？
    当然国际上的事情是复杂的。国际技术与技术交流大会在平息反革命暴乱以后给我这个奖，表明他们还是友好的。美国的人民对中国人民是友好的，这一点我深有体会。就在1950—1955年期间，美国政府整我的时候，就有许多美国朋友安慰我，千方百计地给我解决困难，对我表示了真正的友情。直到最后，我们上船，要离开美国了，他们还组织了一个岸上欢送队来送我们。这是我亲身感受的。我有一个很好的美国朋友，是威廉·西尔斯教授，几年前他到中国来，我去看他。他在住的地方看到不少美国商人，见到我头一句话就说，这些人来中国是要割你们肉的，你们要小心。他是美国人，但他提请我们不要上当。这才是美国真正对中国友好的人。最近江泽民同志在接见我国驻外使节时讲，要两点论，即在对外关系上，既要讲经济，也要讲政治；既要讲友好，也要讲斗争；既要讲原则，也要讲策略。我觉得这是非常正确的。我们要反对“以阶级斗争为纲”这个左的口号，同时也要反对阶级斗争熄灭论，要记住江泽民同志讲的两点论。
    我们是搞科学技术的，但也要考虑经济、政治问题。我常和一起工作的朱光亚同志说这件事。在这样复杂的情况下，党和国家给我们一些科技工作者重要的责任，要我们作科学技术参谋，这件事可不简单。那个时候，我们搞导弹、人造卫星，任务比较清楚、明确，反正就是要干出来，是具体干的问题，而不是要选择方向、途径的问题，大的方向、途径是党中央已经决定了的。但是现在搞科学技术，特别是高技术，有专家委员会或专家组。我深感专家组长不好当，因为现在科学技术在世界上竞争这么激烈，叫科技战，智力战。选择干什么、不干什么、怎么干，对这些问题专家出的主意要是差一点，国家的损失就大了。因此首席科学家的任务比我们那时重得多，复杂得多，要是科学技术战略家才好！所以我们要特别注意培养年轻的接班人，我估计这样的人大概需要200人左右，这200人可是关键。他们既要是科学技术专家，同时又要懂得辩证唯物主义，会用两点论分析问题，了解世界复杂的情况。这样的人设计出的方案才不会出乱子，才会出奇制胜。这是我们国防科委在周恩来和聂荣臻同志领导下，搞大规模系统工程，攻尖端技术的一点体会。科工委科技委的领导同志恐怕要扛起这个担子，我的年纪大了些，只能起国防科工委科技委高级顾问的作用。各位给我的鼓励我很不敢当，但我不泄气，还要尽其所能，为中国的社会主义建设奋斗下去。
