The water level of the Nenjiang River at the Qiqihar section reached 148.35 meters this morning, exceeding the warning water level by 1.35 meters.

This is the third-largest flood since the founding of the People's Republic of China, causing extensive farmland in the suburbs of Qiqihar to be submerged.

Last night at 9 PM, a 13-kilometer-long flood prevention dike in the Meilis area of Qiqihar, known as the Happiness Dike, breached. The raging floodwaters poured through. By this afternoon, 180,000 mu of farmland, 330,000 mu of grassland, 11 farms and fisheries, and 10 villages were flooded to varying degrees. The 1,353 households and 6,766 disaster-affected people who were trapped by the floodwaters have now been evacuated to safe areas.

Since this morning at 3 AM, the four breaches that were opened by the Nenjiang River's major flood last August have been flooded again. Experts predict that they may breach again. Currently, nearly a thousand soldiers and civilians are rushing to the scene to reinforce the defenses.

    嫩江水位越警戒线
    齐齐哈尔郊区大片农田被淹
    新华社哈尔滨7月31日电  嫩江齐齐哈尔江段今晨水位已高达148.35米，超过警戒水位1.35米。
    这次建国以来嫩江第3位大洪水，使齐齐哈尔郊区大面积农田被淹。
    昨晚9时，齐齐哈尔梅里斯区的一条长13公里的农防大坝——幸福坝决口，汹涌的洪水倾泄而下。到今天中午有18万亩农田、33万亩草原、11个农场渔场、10个村屯不同程度地被淹。被洪水围困的1353户、6766名灾民现已陆续撤离到安全地带。
    从今晨3时起，去年8月被嫩江特大洪水冲开的4个决口处又被洪水漫过，专家预测可能再次决口，现在近千名抗洪军民正在抢险。
