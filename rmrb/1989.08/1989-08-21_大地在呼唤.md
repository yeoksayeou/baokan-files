Within the past year, 11 international conferences have been held to discuss global environmental issues, fully demonstrating the international community's concern for environmental problems.

Throughout the long history of human society, a large portion of the earth's land was once covered by forests, and rivers were clear and transparent. Therefore, people often use the phrase "mountains and rivers are clear and beautiful" to describe the beauty and purity of nature.

However, with the rapid increase in population and the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the land and oceans that all living things depend on, as well as the ozone layer surrounding the Earth, are being seriously polluted and damaged.

Due to the large-scale use of mineral fuels, the world emits 5.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. About 50% of this is absorbed by plants and oceans, while the rest remains in the atmosphere, producing a "greenhouse effect" that raises temperatures.

According to experts from the United Nations Environment Programme, the Earth's temperature today is only 5 degrees Celsius higher than it was 10,000 years ago at the end of the 8,000-year-long ice age. In the past 100 years, the Earth's temperature has risen by about 0.7 degrees Celsius. In the next 60 years, the Earth's temperature is expected to rise by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius.

Some scientists predict that due to the rise in temperature, the polar ice caps will melt, causing sea levels to rise by 20 centimeters to 1.4 meters. Some island nations, archipelagos, and coastal regions will be submerged by the sea, and water, drought, and wind disasters will become more frequent and severe.

Due to excessive logging, not only will temperatures rise, but large areas of arable land will turn into deserts and many species will become extinct.

According to a report released by the United Nations Population Fund on May 19 last year, tropical rainforests are decreasing at a rate of 11 million hectares (27 million acres) per year. Each year, 2.6 billion tons of topsoil are lost, and 6 million hectares of land turn into desert. "In Europe and North America, 31 million hectares of forests have already been affected by acid substances in the air and soil. Toxic and dangerous waste is continuously being transported across borders." According to a report released by the European Community Executive Committee on July 27 this year, the tropical rainforests that existed at the beginning of this century had already been reduced by half by the early 1980s. According to figures provided by experts and cited by the United Press International on July 14 this year, 40% of the forests in Central America and a quarter of the forests in Africa have already disappeared.

According to the Japanese magazine "Technology and Economy" in May 1989, from 1978 to 2000, tropical rainforests will decrease by an average of 20 million hectares per year, with 6 million hectares of land becoming barren and 20 million hectares of land losing functionality.

According to the United Nations, by the year 2000, the global area affected by desertification will exceed 24 million square kilometers, which is three times the area in 1977. Scientists estimate that out of the 5 to 10 million species currently existing, 20,000 had already become extinct by 1986, and by the year 2000, 500,000 to 1 million species will become extinct.

Due to the large-scale use of chlorofluorocarbons, the ozone layer is being severely damaged.

The ozone layer, located approximately 20 to 30 kilometers above the Earth's surface, acts like a natural barrier, absorbing more than 99% of ultraviolet rays to protect all living things on Earth. If the ozone layer is damaged, it will lead to a rise in the Earth's temperature and an increase in the incidence of certain diseases.

Scientists believe that chlorofluorocarbons are the main culprits in the destruction of the ozone layer. Chlorofluorocarbons are mainly used in the production of refrigerants, foaming agents, cleaning agents, and propellants. Currently, the global production of chlorofluorocarbons is approximately 1 million tons. According to the Soviet magazine "Companion" in its first issue of 1989, a single chlorine atom can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules, converting ozone into pure oxygen and losing its ability to absorb ultraviolet rays.

According to scientists' observations, the "ozone hole" over the Antarctic is as large as the United States, and the ozone concentration over the Arctic is also periodically becoming thinner.

The Earth calls out: Protect the global environment for future generations. From the international conferences that have already been held, there has been more discussion and fewer concrete measures and actions taken.

Scientists believe that protecting the global environment is a shared responsibility of the international community. Existing international economic and financial institutions should coordinate and assist countries, especially developing countries in need of significant help, in financial and technological aspects.

It is estimated that industrialized countries produce 75% of the world's chlorofluorocarbons and consume 75% of the world's mineral fuels. Therefore, industrialized countries should exert more effort in managing and protecting the global environment.

The summit of the seven major Western countries held in Paris in mid-July expressed that the participating countries will work together to protect the global environment, "to achieve common economic and social goals and fulfill obligations to future generations." Many countries hope that these promises will be turned into actions.

    大地在呼唤
    新华社记者　李长久
    在过去一年之内，世界各国已举行过11次国际会议，讨论全球环境问题，这充分说明国际社会对环境问题的关注。
    在人类社会漫长的历史时期里，地球陆地的很大一部分曾经被森林覆盖，河水清澈见底，因此，人们常常以“山清水秀”形容大自然的美丽和洁净。
    然而，随着人口的急剧增加和工农业生产的大发展，万物赖以生存的大地和海洋以及围绕地球的臭氧层正在遭受严重污染和破坏。
    由于人类大量使用矿物燃料，世界每年排放到大气中的二氧化碳达55亿吨，其中约50％被植物和海洋吸收，其余留在大气层中，产生“温室效应”，使气温升高。
    据联合国环境规划署的专家估计，如今地球的气温，与一万年前结束的历时8000年的冰河时期期间的气温相比，仅上升了5摄氏度。在过去的100年里，地球气温约上升了0.7摄氏度。在今后的60年里，地球气温将上升1.5至4.5摄氏度。
    有些科学家预计，由于气温升高使极地冰帽融化，海平面将上升20厘米至1.4米，一些岛国、群岛和沿海地区将被海水淹没，水、旱、风灾将更加频繁和严重。
    由于过量采伐森林，不仅将导致气温升高，而且将使大面积良田变成沙漠和大量物种绝种。
    据联合国人口基金会去年5月19日发表的一份报告说，热带雨林以每年1100万公顷（2700万英亩）的速度在减少，每年有260亿吨的土壤耕作层流失，600万公顷的土地变为沙漠。“在欧洲和北美，3100万公顷的森林已经受到了空气中和土壤里酸性物质的影响。有毒和危险的废物在不断地运出国界。”据欧洲共同体执行委员会今年7月27日发表的报告中说，本世纪初存在的热带雨林到80年代初已经减少一半。据合众国际社今年7月14日援引专家们提供的数字，中美洲森林的40％和非洲森林的1／4已不复存在。
    据日本《技术和经济》月刊1989年5月一期预计，从1978年到2000年，热带雨林平均每年减少2000万公顷，每年约有600万公顷的土地荒废，2000万公顷土地机能下降。
    据联合国预测，到2000年全球沙漠化面积将超过2400万平方公里，将是1977年的3倍。科学家们估计，现存的500万到1000万种生物种中到1986年已有2万种绝种，到2000年将有50万到100万种绝种。
    由于大量使用氯氟烃，臭氧层正在遭到严重破坏。
    在离地球表面大约20至30公里高度的臭氧层，如同一道天然屏障，能吸收99％以上的紫外线，以保护地球上的生灵万物。臭氧层遭到破坏，将导致地球气温上升和一些疾病发病率提高。
    科学家们认为，氯氟烃是破坏臭氧层的元凶。氯氟烃主要用于制造制冷剂、发泡剂、洗净剂和推进剂，现在全世界的氯氟烃产量约100万吨。据苏联《伴侣》杂志1989年第一期报道，一个氯原子可以破坏10万个臭氧分子，使臭氧变成纯氧，丧失吸收紫外线的性能。
    据科学家们探测，南极上空的“臭氧空洞”已大如美国面积，北极上空的臭氧浓度也在定期地变得稀薄。
    大地在呼唤：为子孙后代保护全球环境。从已经举行过的有关国际会议看，多属议论多、采取的切实措施和行动少。
    科学家们认为，保护全球环境是国际社会的共同责任，现有国际经济和金融机构应在财政和技术上协调和帮助各国特别是需要大力帮助发展中国家。
    据估计，工业发达国家的氯氟烃产量占世界氯氟烃总量的75％，这些国家消费的矿物燃料占世界矿物燃料总消费的75％。因此，工业发达国家应对治理和保护全球环境付出更多的力量。
    今年7月中旬在巴黎举行的西方七国首脑会议表示，与会国家将共同努力来保护全球环境，“以实现共同的经济和社会目标以及履行对子孙后代的义务”。很多国家希望它们能够把这些许诺变成行动。
