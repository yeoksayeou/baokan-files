The suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots and the successful convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee are a great victory. This turmoil has given everyone a rich lesson on building socialism. Drawing lessons from this experience is of profound significance.

This turmoil exposed two types of contradictions. One is the contradiction between a small number of anti-party and anti-socialist elements colluding with reactionary forces abroad and the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, which has a clear confrontational nature. The other is the contradiction between party and government leadership and the masses, caused by our mistakes. This contradiction cannot be avoided and should not be avoided. It is precisely because this internal contradiction was exploited by domestic and foreign reactionary forces that the situation became so complex and eventually developed into a counter-revolutionary riot. Fortunately, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other veteran proletarian revolutionaries at the helm, the riot was quickly suppressed, preventing greater losses.

This turmoil was not an accident but the result of the continuous intensification and interaction of the two types of contradictions mentioned above. The most important reason for the intensification of these contradictions is the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization ideology into various fields, including theory, literature, news, publishing, culture, and education, among others, though to varying degrees.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we firmly and comprehensively implemented the correct line, principles, and policies for about five or six years. All work was full of vitality, and reform and opening up achieved great success. In the spring of 1979, when the bourgeois liberalization ideology first emerged, Comrade Xiaoping immediately countered it by advocating the Four Cardinal Principles, suppressing those who attempted to create turmoil, and maintaining peace for several years. However, by 1983, the bourgeois liberalization ideology resurfaced. The rectification of the Party and the campaign against spiritual pollution, both decided by the Twelfth Central Committee, were not well implemented, especially the campaign against spiritual pollution, which was aborted after 28 days, giving those who wanted liberalization the green light. In the spring and summer of 1987, soon after Comrade Zhao Ziyang became the acting general secretary, he abruptly halted the ongoing struggle against liberalization. Since then, the bourgeois liberalization ideology has become increasingly rampant, and foreign reactionary ideas and vices have taken advantage of the situation, running amok. In the past two or three years, Comrade Zhao Ziyang has been passive towards the Four Cardinal Principles, making many mistakes. Problems in economic construction have also accumulated, the most obvious being the uncontrollable inflation and the increasingly serious issue of unfair distribution. Additionally, there are many hidden dangers. The Party does not manage the Party, the government is not clean, leadership is weakened, work styles are deteriorating, many grassroots organizations are paralyzed and degraded, many Party and government cadres are seriously alienated from the masses, and various corrupt practices are rapidly spreading, causing discontent among the people, especially the practice of official profiteering, which is deeply despised by the people. Meanwhile, overseas and foreign reactionary forces, either secretly plotting or openly inciting, have stirred up trouble. Thus, internal contradictions have intensified, and contradictions between domestic and foreign reactionary forces and the Party and the state have also intensified. External factors have played a role through internal factors. In this turmoil, reactionary elements also raised slogans against official profiteering, corruption, and bureaucratism, deliberately exploiting internal contradictions to deceive some uninformed masses. From this, we can draw a lesson: we must not do things that alienate the masses and lose their support, lest we be used by the enemy.

Only by correctly handling the aforementioned two types of contradictions can we stabilize the overall situation and truly restore a politically stable and united atmosphere. Currently, we should continue to focus on suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots to correctly resolve confrontational contradictions. In the long term, the fundamental solution lies in addressing various issues related to internal contradictions, winning the trust of the people, and restoring the authority of Party and government leadership in the eyes of the people. Issues such as punishing official profiteering, eliminating corruption, regulating the economy, stabilizing prices, rectifying Party discipline, strengthening education, purifying organizations, and severely cracking down on various criminal elements to maintain normal order are all matters of great concern to the people and should be addressed promptly. The communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session states that several matters of general concern to the people will be addressed, and that the Party will not let down the people's expectations, which has been well received. Matters such as official profiteering, which are deeply despised by the people, should indeed be addressed by high-level leaders, and those with problems among their own children should set an example by taking drastic measures. Comrade Jiang Zemin's remarks at the meeting with non-Party personages about the work of thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots and stopping the turmoil, which emphasize the need to be both resolute and strict in distinguishing between different types of contradictions, are accurate and powerful. If this matter is truly addressed, it will also win the hearts of the people.

To correctly handle the aforementioned contradictions, several issues of ideological understanding need to be addressed.

First, regarding class struggle. In the past, emphasizing class struggle as the key link and using political movements to persecute people was very wrong. However, if we go to the other extreme and believe that the world is peaceful and that class struggle at home and abroad is about to die out, that is also incorrect and very dangerous. History tells us: during periods of severe crisis in the capitalist world, some communists are prone to the error of seeking quick success; while in periods of relative stability and development in capitalist countries, some communists are prone to losing direction, even to the point of attempting to negate Marxism. We should re-evaluate international capitalism and learn from it what is beneficial to socialism, but we must not believe that they have become saints and completely abandoned their plans to eliminate the communist movement. At home, the exploiting classes have long been eliminated, but enemy forces will exist for a long time. In recent years, various anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization, and new and old criminals have joined forces, forming a reactionary force that is becoming increasingly rampant and receiving support from foreign reactionary forces. Many of these people are the backbone of this counter-revolutionary riot. Reactionary forces will not accept defeat, and we must not take them lightly or be complacent.

Second, regarding political leadership. Insisting on the Four Cardinal Principles is insisting on political leadership. Comrade Mao Zedong proposed that all work in building socialism should be politically led, which is not wrong. Focusing on economic construction does not contradict insisting on political leadership. The series of policies and principles since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, especially the simultaneous development of material and spiritual civilization and the one center and two basic points, are all about insisting on political leadership. However, in implementation, it has gradually changed. Comrade Zhao Ziyang abandoned the Four Cardinal Principles, weakened ideological and political work, allowing liberalization to spread everywhere and corruption to flourish. The former is a direct result of abandoning political leadership, and the latter is an indirect result. After this turmoil, the new central leadership decided to carry out education and struggle against bourgeois liberalization, insisting on the Four Cardinal Principles, strengthening spiritual civilization construction, emphasizing long-term persistence, and not giving up halfway. They also took practical actions to oppose corruption and strengthen clean governance, which is completely correct. Now, we should start building a capable team of cadres on the ideological front. We are engaged in socialist economic construction and socialist reform and opening up. Once we deviate from the Party's leadership and the socialist path, that is, abandon the principle of political leadership, we will inevitably go astray.

Third, regarding economic laws. Marxist economics tells us that objective laws are unyielding, and we should take a completely honest attitude towards them. We often remember objective laws only after suffering setbacks. But when economic development is smooth, we often forget this point, even pushing it aside. Some of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's mistakes in economic work are due to not listening to different opinions, not starting from reality, not considering China's actual situation, and violating objective economic laws, resulting in economic overheating and serious supply-demand imbalances. The lesson is very profound. Of course, there are objective laws common to any society, objective laws unique to socialist society, and special objective laws in building socialism in China. The primary task of Chinese communists and revolutionaries is to strive to understand and master the laws of building socialism that suit China's national conditions, as required by Comrade Xiaoping.

Fourth, regarding the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. No one will oppose this, but few people really work hard at it, and even fewer people truly understand and apply it. Under the influence of the rampant bourgeois liberalization ideology, a strange phenomenon has emerged: some so-called Marxist-Leninist scholars are anti-Marxist-Leninist, and some have even become key figures in this turmoil. Of course, this is a special situation. Without studying Marxist-Leninist theory, it is difficult to distinguish right from wrong and do a good job. Most Party and government leaders are very busy, working overtime, and very hardworking. It seems unreasonable to ask them to read Marxist-Leninist works every day, so they can only arrange it themselves. But there are indeed some leaders who do not work hard, do not read books, do not read Marxist-Leninist works, and still feel at ease. Now, many young students do not want to attend political classes or read Marxist-Leninist works, which cannot be said to have nothing to do with this trend.

In recent years, with the rampant bourgeois liberalization ideology, pragmatism has also become highly valued. China has long been dominated by small-scale peasant economy, which reflects in ideology as a tendency towards one-sidedness, absolutism, and extremism. Comrade Mao Zedong often required communists to learn Marxist epistemology and dialectics, which was very targeted. In the future, the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, especially philosophy, must be emphasized. Now, we should use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to specifically analyze the various aspects, causes, and consequences of this turmoil and riot, summarize experiences, draw lessons, raise awareness, improve work, overcome difficulties, and avoid repeating mistakes.

    从平息暴乱中认真总结经验教训
    梅行
    平息反革命暴乱，顺利召开党的十三届四中全会，是一大胜利。这场动乱给大家上了一堂内容丰富的关于建设社会主义的政治课。由此总结经验，吸取教训，有着深远的意义。
    这场动乱暴露了两种矛盾。一种是极少数反党反社会主义分子勾结国际上反动势力，同中国共产党和中国人民的矛盾，它具有明显的对抗性质。再一种，是由于我们工作失误引起的党政领导同人民群众之间的矛盾。这一矛盾不能回避，也不应回避。正是因为这种人民内部矛盾被国内外反动势力所利用，使情况变得非常复杂，最后发展成为反革命暴乱。幸有邓小平同志等老一辈无产阶级革命家掌舵，暴乱才得以很快平息，避免了更大的损失。
    这场动乱确实不是偶然发生的，是上述两种矛盾不断激化并相互作用的结果。两种矛盾所以激化，最重要的一点，就是资产阶级自由化思潮侵入到各个领域，理论、文艺、新闻、出版、文化、教育等等，无一例外，只是程度有所不同而已。
    党的十一届三中全会以后的五六年间，我们坚定地全面地执行正确的路线和方针、政策，各项工作生气勃勃，改革开放取得很大成就。1979年春，资产阶级自由化思潮一露头，小平同志就针锋相对，提出坚持四项基本原则，把那些企图制造动乱的人压了下去，天下太平了好几年。但是，到了1983年，资产阶级自由化思潮抬头，党的十二届二中全会决定的整党和反对精神污染两件大事，都没有做好，特别是反精神污染搞了28天就夭折，更为那些一心想搞自由化的人开了绿灯。1987年春夏之交，赵紫阳同志代理总书记不久，又把正在进行的反自由化斗争一棍子打掉。此后，资产阶级自由化思潮日益泛滥，国外反动思想和丑恶东西也乘虚而入，肆意横行。近两三年，赵紫阳同志消极对待四项基本原则，出现了不少失误。经济建设事业本身的问题也越积越多，最明显的是通货膨胀难以抑止，分配不公日益严重，并且潜伏着不少隐患。加之，党不管党，政不廉洁，领导削弱，作风日坏，一些基层组织瘫痪变质，不少党政干部严重脱离群众，社会上种种腐败现象迅速滋长，引起群众不满，尤其是官倒歪风为人民深恶痛绝。与此同时，海外国外的反动势力，或暗中策划，或明火执杖，挑拨离间，兴风作浪。于是，人民内部矛盾激化了，国内外反动势力同党和国家的对抗性矛盾也激化了。外因通过内因而起作用。在这次动乱中，反动分子也提出反官倒、反腐败、反官僚主义的口号，就是有意利用人民内部矛盾，使一些不明真相的群众受到了蒙蔽。从这里可以得出一条教训，我们决不要做脱离群众、丧失民心的事，以免为敌所用。
    只有正确处理上述两种矛盾，才能稳定全局，真正恢复安定团结的政治局面。在目前，首先应当继续抓紧做好平息反革命暴乱的工作，使对抗性矛盾得到正确解决。从长远看，根本之计在于解决人民内部矛盾的种种问题，取信于民，恢复党政领导在人民群众中的威信。诸如惩治官倒、清除腐败、治理经济、稳定物价、整顿党风、加强教育、纯洁组织，以及严厉打击社会上各种犯罪分子以维护正常秩序等等人民群众最关切的问题，应抓紧抓好。四中全会公报说，要切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情，决不辜负人民对党的期望，大家听了很高兴。像官倒这种人民深恶痛绝的事，确实应该由高级领导人带头惩治，自己子女有问题的，要大义灭亲，做出榜样。江泽民同志在党外人士座谈会上讲的关于彻底平息反革命暴乱和制止动乱的工作，既要坚决抓紧，又要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾那段话，准确有力。这件事真做好了，也可大得民心。
    正确处理好上述矛盾，还要解决几个思想认识问题。
    第一，关于阶级斗争。过去以阶级斗争为纲，并且用政治运动的方式整人，是很错误的。但如果走向另一极端，以为天下太平，国内外的阶级斗争行将熄灭，也不正确，而且危险很大。历史告诉人们：在资本主义世界发生严重危机时期，有些共产党人容易犯急于求成的错误，总想一举成功；而在资本主义国家相对稳定和发展时期，有些共产党人又容易迷失方向，甚至发生企图否定马克思主义的错误。我们对国际资本主义要再认识，并从中取得有益于社会主义的东西，但决不能认为，它们已经立地成佛，彻底放弃消灭共产主义运动的图谋了。在国内，剥削阶级早已消灭，但敌对势力将长期存在。近几年，各种反党反社会主义的分子，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，新旧犯罪分子等等，他们呵成一气，形成一股反动势力，日益猖獗，并且得到国外反动势力的支持。这股势力中的许多人，是制造这次反革命暴乱的骨干。反动势力是不会甘心失败的，我们决不能等闲视之，掉以轻心。
    第二，关于政治领导。坚持四项基本原则就是坚持政治领导。毛泽东同志提出建设社会主义的各项工作都要政治领导，并没有错。以经济建设为中心与坚持政治领导并不矛盾。党的十一届三中全会后的一系列方针政策，特别是物质文明和精神文明一起抓，一个中心和两个基本点，都是坚持政治领导的。但在执行中逐渐变了样。赵紫阳同志就是把四项基本原则抛在一边，削弱思想政治工作，使得自由化思潮到处泛滥，腐败现象丛生，前者是放弃政治领导的直接结果，后者是其间接结果。经过这次动乱，中央新的领导集体决定开展坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争，加强精神文明建设，强调长期坚持，决不半途而废，并且用实际行动反对腐败，加强廉政建设，是完全正确的。现在就应着手在思想战线上建立一支得力的干部队伍。我们进行的是社会主义的经济建设，是社会主义的改革开放，一旦离开党的领导和社会主义道路，即放弃政治领导的原则，必然走到邪路上去。
    第三，关于经济规律。马克思主义经济学告诉我们，客观规律铁面无私，我们应取完全老实的态度。我们往往受了挫折才想到客观规律是不能冒犯的。但一到经济发展顺利时，往往就淡忘了这一点，甚至把它丢到一边。赵紫阳同志在经济工作中的一些失误，就是听不进不同意见，不从实际出发，不顾我国实际情况，违背了客观经济规律，以致发生经济过热、供求严重失衡等问题，教训是极其深刻的。当然，有任何社会都通行的客观规律，有社会主义社会专有的客观规律，还有在中国建设社会主义的特殊规律。中国共产党人和革命者首要的任务，是按照邓小平同志的要求，努力去认识和掌握符合中国国情的建设社会主义的规律。
    第四，关于学习马列理论。这一条谁也不会反对，但真下苦功夫的不多，学懂能运用的人就更少了。在资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥下，出现了一个怪现象，就是有些所谓研究马列的人反马列，有的人竟在这次动乱中成了风云人物。当然这是特殊情况。不学马列，就分不清大是大非，做好工作也难。我们党政机关多数领导人，工作很忙，加班加点，辛苦得很，要求他们每天读马列著作，似为苛求，只能请他们自己安排。但确有一些领导干部，工作不上劲，又不读书，更不读马列，还心安理得。现在有许多青年学生不愿上政治课，不读马列著作，不能说与这种风气没有关系。
    近年来，随着资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，实用主义也身价十倍。我国过去长期小农经济占统治地位，反映到意识形态上，就容易产生片面性，搞绝对化，走极端。毛泽东同志过去经常要求共产党人学习马克思主义的认识论和辩证法，是很有针对性的。今后，学习马列理论这件事，特别是学哲学，必须抓起来。现在，就要用马列主义的立场、观点和方法，对这次动乱和暴乱的各个方面、前因后果作具体分析，总结经验，吸取教训，提高觉悟，以改进工作，克服困难，并避免错误重犯。
