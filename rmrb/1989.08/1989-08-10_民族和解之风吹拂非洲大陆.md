The wind of national reconciliation is sweeping across the vast African continent. Following the recent handshake between Angolan President Dos Santos and the leader of the rebel group UNITA, Savimbi, which marked the end of a 14-year civil war and the beginning of national reconciliation, a political trend towards resolving domestic conflicts and seeking national reconciliation has emerged:

	— The Mozambican government has begun constructive contact with the leaders of the resistance movement to politically resolve the 13-year war. Kenyan President Moi recently flew to Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, to mediate, and was welcomed by both sides.

	— After the Ethiopian Parliament proposed a six-point peace initiative to resolve the Eritrean issue, the relevant parties seized the opportunity to actively mediate. Former U.S. President Carter visited Ethiopia for this purpose. It is expected that peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, which have been fighting for 28 years, will soon begin.

	— Sudan's new Prime Minister Bashir, upon taking office, made resolving the southern conflict an urgent priority. To show his sincerity, Prime Minister Bashir unilaterally declared a ceasefire and actively prepared for formal peace talks with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in August.

	— Somali President Siad recently expressed his willingness to negotiate with armed opposition groups at any time and place to end the northern conflict as soon as possible.

	In summary, several African countries that have been plagued by long-standing internal wars are showing signs of ceasefire and reconciliation. This is the most prominent new development in the political landscape of African countries this year and will have a positive impact on the peace and development of the continent.

	The trend of national reconciliation in Africa is not an isolated or accidental phenomenon but a necessary result of the changing international situation and the desire of relevant countries for peace and development. For many years, some African countries have been ravaged by war, leading to barren fields, widespread suffering, and economic collapse. The desire for peace and reconciliation has become a shared aspiration of the people. The warring parties have gradually come to realize from harsh realities that further fighting will only lead to mutual destruction, and that national reconciliation is the wise choice. At the same time, the economic gap between many African countries and developed countries, as well as other developing countries, has widened in recent years. They fear that if they do not change their course, they will be further marginalized and perpetually trapped in a state of backwardness in the changing international political and economic landscape. Driven by a sense of collective crisis and urgency, they have strengthened their efforts to achieve regional peace in an "African way."

	On the other hand, the superpowers have adjusted their policies towards Africa within the framework of East-West détente and comprehensive power competition, hoping to reduce the financial burden of supporting internal wars and to some extent disengage. Therefore, they are willing to see relative stability in the African region and have changed their previous overt interference in the internal affairs of African countries. They, along with some other Western countries, have reduced military and weapons aid to the relevant countries and participated in the process of promoting peace talks. Moreover, since last year, several regional hotspots in Africa have cooled down or been initially resolved. Namibia's independence is in sight, and South Africa's aggression and harassment of neighboring countries have also subsided. This has improved relations between the relevant countries, making it more feasible and possible to address the issue of politically resolving domestic conflicts. The process of African countries resolving internal conflicts through political dialogue and achieving national reconciliation has just begun and will not be smooth sailing. The internal conflicts of African countries have lasted for many years and are intertwined with historical disputes, tribal conflicts, and demands for national autonomy, making the political and social background complex. The warring parties have deep-seated differences and grievances, and external forces are involved, making political resolution difficult. It seems that true peace and stability will take time. However, looking at the overall situation, due to significant changes in the international environment and the situation in Africa, a political atmosphere and objective conditions conducive to resolving conflicts through negotiations and dialogue have initially emerged. Moreover, the development issues of Africa have become increasingly urgent and prominent, and the desire for peace and change has become a trend. Therefore, the basic trend of African countries politically resolving conflicts and achieving national reconciliation will continue to develop, bringing new hope to the troubled African continent.

    民族和解之风吹拂非洲大陆
    刘鲁　明非
    随着安哥拉总统多斯·桑托斯同反政府游击队安盟领导人萨文比不久前握手言好，宣布结束14年兄弟相煎的内战，实现民族和解，一股政治解决国内战乱、谋求民族和解的习习熏风，开始吹拂广袤的非洲大陆：
    ——莫桑比克政府为政治解决持续13年的战乱，最近开始同抵抗运动领导人进行建设性接触。肯尼亚总统莫伊日前飞往莫首都马普托进行居间调解，受到莫对立双方的欢迎。
    ——埃塞俄比亚议会提出解决厄立特里亚问题的六点和平倡议后，有关各方趁热打铁，积极进行斡旋，美国前总统卡特为此日前访问了埃塞俄比亚。预计埃政府同交战28年的厄解放阵线之间的和谈帷幕，不久即将拉开。
    ——苏丹新总理巴希尔执政伊始，即把和平解决南方战乱问题作为当务之急。为表明诚意，巴希尔总理单方面宣布实行停火，同时积极筹备在8月份同反政府武装苏丹人民解放军正式举行和谈。
    ——索马里总统西亚德在最近召开的执政党代表大会上，表示愿同武装反对派在任何时间、地点进行谈判，以求尽快结束北方战乱。
    总之，非洲几个经年内战不息的国家，近来几乎都呈现出停战求和趋势，这是今年以来非洲国家政局中最突出的新动向，对该大陆的和平与发展将产生积极的影响。
    非洲出现的民族和解势头，并非孤立的偶然现象，而是国际形势演变及有关国家渴求和平、发展的必然结果。多年来，一些非洲国家战火连绵，致使田园荒芜，生灵涂炭，国家不堪重负，经济濒临崩溃。厌战思和，早已成为各国人民的共同心愿。交战双方也日渐从严酷的现实中认识到，再打下去只能两败俱伤，民族和解才是明智之举。同时，广大非洲国家近年来同发达国家和其他发展中国家集团之间在经济上的差距日益拉大，它们担心在变化了的国际政治和经济格局面前，如不改弦更张将有被进一步冷落和永远陷入落后状态的危险，因而在一种集体危机感和紧迫感的催动下，加强了
  “以非洲方式”谋求实现地区和平的努力。导致安哥拉民族和解的巴多利特宣言，就是扎伊尔等非洲国家领导人经过艰苦调解直接促成的。
    另一方面，超级大国在东西方缓和及综合国力较量的架构内调整了对非政策，希望减轻各自支持内战的财政包袱和有限度地脱身，因而愿意看到非洲地区保持相对稳定，并改变以往露骨干涉非洲国家内政的作法。它们和其他西方一些国家，减少了对有关国家的军事和武器援助，并参与推动和谈的进程。再者，去年以来，非洲几个地区热点问题普遍降温或得到初步解决，纳米比亚独立在望，南非对邻国的侵略和骚扰亦有所收敛。这使有关国家之间的关系得以改善，因而较前有条件和精力顾及政治解决国内战乱问题。非洲国家通过政治对话解决内乱、实现民族和解的进程刚刚起步，不会是一帆风顺的。非洲国家的内部战乱均已持续多年，且同历史纠纷、部族矛盾、民族自治要求等棘手问题交织在一起，政治社会背景错综复杂；交战双方歧见和积怨甚深，再加外部势力插手，政治解决的难度很大。看来要真正实现和平与稳定还得假以时日。但综观全局，由于国际环境和非洲形势已发生显著的变化，初步出现了有利于通过谈判、对话解决战乱的政治氛围和客观条件，而且非洲的发展问题又变得日益紧迫、突出，人心思和求变已成大势所趋，所以，非洲国家政治解决战乱、实现民族和解的基本趋势会继续发展下去，为多灾多难的非洲大陆带来新的希望。
