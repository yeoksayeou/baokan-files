The second Chinese Art Festival, named "Swan Song," officially opened in Harbin today, marking the beginning of a 10-day series of activities.

After the "Swan Song" closes, 11 activity points in other provinces and cities across the country will continue, forming a two-month-long second Chinese Art Festival.

The "Swan Song" festival, featuring over 1,800 performers and staff, showcases 22 programs from various art genres created by Heilongjiang Province in recent years. The programs are rich in content and diverse in form. Additionally, there are three mass art competitions and three exhibitions, demonstrating the achievements of the people of the northern frontier in implementing the Party's "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy.

Ying Ruocheng, deputy head of the organizing committee of the second Art Festival and vice minister of the Ministry of Culture, attended the event and delivered a speech. He said that holding an art festival is to inspire the creative enthusiasm of a wide range of professional and amateur artists, to ensure that art advances along the socialist path of health, unity, and encouragement for the people. He hoped that artists would cherish the current stable situation, firmly implement the Party's art policy, adhere to the four cardinal principles, further open up the path of reform and opening up, and promote and develop socialist art.
