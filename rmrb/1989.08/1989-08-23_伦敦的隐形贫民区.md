London is bustling, beautiful, and has a high standard of living, which is undeniable. However, despite not intending to seek out the opposite corners, the countless Londoners wandering the streets still inevitably catch your eye.

Just a few dozen meters from where we live, on a bench next to the church steps, there is always an older man in his fifties with a full beard sitting there every evening. He closes his eyes, tilts his head to one side, and places his hands, which are folded together, on his stomach. Throughout the year, he always wears the same slightly shiny black suit and a pair of leather boots. His entire belongings are a gray suitcase. At night, a worn-out blanket keeps him warm; on clear days, the bench is his bed; on rainy days, the church doorway becomes his bedroom.

In fact, he is just one of the countless homeless people. In some corners of the London Underground, you can often see people in tattered clothes and dirty appearances holding signs that say "unemployed" or "homeless," with a container in front of them for passersby to donate. In the evenings, pedestrians often encounter beggars, many of whom are middle-aged men. By night, the subway stations, restaurant eaves, street benches, and even the stone steps of statues in the squares become their shelters.

The *Independent*, a national newspaper, recently reported that the Psychology Department of Surrey University published a survey at the end of July, stating that London has a slum area whose scale is comparable to some cities in Latin America. The difference is that London's slum area is "hidden." The report estimates that there are currently 75,000 homeless people in London, and adding those who have ended up on the streets for other reasons, the total number reaches 130,000.

According to the report, 400 volunteers participated in the survey conducted by Surrey University. In April, on a cold and damp night, the investigators walked the streets, searching for traces of the homeless. They found 753 people sleeping rough. This number is three times that of a similar survey conducted in 1965.

Mr. De Stockley, who is involved in this research at Surrey University, expressed the hope that the use of government funds should help alleviate this increasingly urgent social problem. It seems that what is hidden is actually visible. This considerable "hidden poor" army has already drawn attention.

### 伦敦的隐形贫民区

    伦敦的隐形贫民区
    张文英
    伦敦繁华、美丽、生活水准高，无可置疑。然而，尽管你无意去寻找那与之相反的犄角旮旯，但一个个浪迹街头的伦敦穷人，还总不免要闯入你的眼帘。
    在离我们住处几十米远的教堂台阶旁的一条长凳上，每天傍晚总坐着一位五十开外、满脸络腮胡子的男人。他双目紧闭，头歪向一边，一双搭合在一起的手放在肚子上。一年四季，他总穿着那身有些油亮的黑色衣衫，脚穿一双皮靴。他的全部家当是一只灰色行李箱。入夜，一块破旧的花毯御寒；晴天，长凳就是他的床；雨天，教堂门洞便是他的卧室。
    其实，这只是成千上万无家可归者中的一员。在伦敦地铁的一些过道角落，你常可以看到一些衣衫破旧，形容污秽的人举着“失业”、“无家可归”的牌子，面前放一个让行人施舍的器皿。傍晚漫步街头，行人常常受到讨钱人的纠缠，其中不少竟是壮年男子。到了晚上，地铁车站、饭店屋檐下、街头长椅，甚至广场塑像石阶上，便成了他们的栖身之所。
    《独立报》这家全国性大报，最近报道说，萨里大学心理系于7月底发表一份调查报告称，伦敦有一个贫民区，其规模犹如拉丁美洲国家一些城市的贫民区，不同的是，伦敦的贫民区是“隐形”的。报告估计，现在，伦敦无家可归者有75000人，再加上由于其它原因流落街头者，总数达13万人。
    据报道，有400名自愿者参加了萨里大学的这项调查工作。今年4月，在一个寒冷、潮湿的夜晚，调查者走街串巷，寻觅无家可归者的踪迹，他们发现了753位露宿街头者。这个数字是1965年类似调查的三倍。
    萨里大学从事这项研究工作的德·斯托克利先生表示，希望政府基金的使用应有利于缓解这一日趋紧迫的社会问题。看来，道是隐形却有形。这支数量可观的“隐形贫民”大军，已引起人们的关注。
