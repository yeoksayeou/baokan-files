Title: A Butter Tea Bowl

A small, delicate, and shiny wooden bowl with a red base adorned with silver foil, has been sitting in my bookcase for over a decade. This is a butter tea bowl commonly used by the Tibetan people. Every time I see it, I can't help but miss the old lady, Central Zong, from the northern Tibetan plateau...

Fifteen years ago, I was assigned from the interior to a small county in the northern Tibetan plateau to teach. One winter morning, I rode a horse to the county town, about a hundred miles away, to buy textbooks for my students. Unexpectedly, halfway through the journey, the weather changed abruptly, and a severe snowstorm hit the grasslands. In the blinding snow, I lost my way. Worse still, in the evening, the horse was startled by a hare that darted out from a thicket of red willows, and it bucked, throwing me off and injuring my ankle. I couldn't stand up, and the usually docile white horse, which had been left behind, ran away with the wind.

Night fell. A nearby frozen river occasionally cracked with a sharp sound. The snowstorm still hadn't stopped, and the extreme cold made my blood seem to freeze solid. My limbs were stiff and numb, but my mind was still clear. Lying in the snow, a wave of desperate sadness washed over me. I thought of my parents, bent over from farm work on the Loess Plateau, and my grandmother with her head full of silver hair. My students, Nima, Dawa, and Solang... Farewell, my loved ones! Perhaps the final note of my life will be written on this vast snowfield! I don't know how long I lay there before I lost consciousness from the cold.

I don't know how much time passed, but I felt a bright light in front of my eyes. It was sunlight; the sky had cleared! I thought, and opened my eyes to see a butter lamp in front of me, its flame flickering in the wind. I was lying in a tent, with thick sheep skins and cushions underneath me, and a warm Tibetan blanket over me. A pair of frozen feet were being warmed by an old Tibetan woman's chest, and the lamp's light shone on her wrinkled face. Her head was adorned with countless small braids, many of which were white. Her loving gaze made me feel familiar and warm. Ah, wasn't that the same look my mother had when she looked at me? I couldn't help but call out, "Mother!"

"Blessed by the Buddha! You finally woke up, child!" She took a small pot from the cow dung fire: "Drink some hot milk. I'll feed you."

I shook my head.

Seeing that I wouldn't eat, she comforted me, saying, "Child, you have a fever. Coqma has already ridden to the county to get a doctor for you."

"Mother, how did I get to your tent?" I asked, puzzled.

She continued to gently rub my feet to restore circulation while explaining.

It turned out that my startled horse had run about ten miles to Central Zong's sheep pen to hide from the wind. The old lady guarding the pen saw a horse with an empty saddle in the middle of the night and suspected that its owner had met with an accident in the blizzard. She woke up her daughter, Coqma, to take her place, and she herself took the herding dog and led the horse, following the faint hoofprints in the snow, to find me. She carried me, unconscious from the cold, back to the tent on the horse. Coqma recognized me in the lamplight as the teacher who had gone to the county to buy books for them, and she cried bitterly. Central Zong immediately sent her daughter on horseback to the county to get a doctor, and she herself stayed by my side. This love from another ethnic group's mother moved me to tears.

Listening to the howling north wind outside the tent, I realized that the blizzard hadn't stopped. In such harsh weather, sending a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl to ride alone for fifty or sixty miles at night was incredibly dangerous!

The next noon, the county hospital's ambulance arrived, but Coqma did not return with it. The doctor told us that Coqma had frostbite on her left foot the night before, and after a consultation, it was decided to amputate the frostbitten toes.

"Buddha, how could you do this to an innocent little lamb!" Central Zong sobbed. The doctor's eyes also reddened, and I gripped Central Zong's hand in guilt, not knowing what to say.

The ambulance was about to leave with me, but Central Zong still had to take care of a flock of pregnant ewes and couldn't come with us to visit the injured daughter. She climbed onto the ambulance, tucked my blanket in, and stuffed a butter tea bowl with a silver base into my shoulder bag: "Take it with you, child. You can't do without a butter tea bowl on the grasslands!"

More than a decade has passed. Today, as I gaze at this butter tea bowl, I once again bless Central Zong, wishing her happiness, joy, and good fortune!

    一只酥油茶碗
    樊总辉
    一只玲珑光亮、底座上镶着缕花银箔的红色小木碗，放在我书柜中已有十多个年头了。这是一只藏族常用的酥油茶碗。每当看到它时，我就不禁怀念起远在藏北高原上的央宗阿妈……
    15年前，我从内地分配到藏北高原一个边陲小县的牧区当教师。一个冬日的早晨，我骑马到百里之外的县城给学生买课本，没料到半路上天气突变，一场特大的暴风雪袭击了草原，在漫天风雪中我迷失了方向。更糟糕的是，黄昏时候，马被红柳丛中窜出的一只野兔惊得猛一纵身，将我摔下了马背，扭伤了踝骨，疼得站不起来，而那匹平日老实温顺的大白马，此时丢下我顺着风一溜烟地跑了。
    夜幕降临了，身旁的一条冰河，不时发出冻裂的嚓嚓声。风雪仍没有停止，极度的严寒，使我周身的血液似乎被冻得凝固了，我四肢僵硬麻木，但头脑还清醒，卧在雪地里，心中涌起一阵绝望的悲哀。我想起了远在黄土高原被农活累弯了腰的父母，想起满头银发的老奶奶，我的学生尼玛、达瓦、索朗……别了，亲人们！我生命的休止符大概就画在这茫茫的雪原上了！不知过了多久，我冻得失去了知觉。
    又不知过了多久，我觉得眼前一片光亮，是阳光，天晴了！我想，睁开眼一看，原来头前放着盏酥油灯，灯火被风吹得直跳。原来，我躺在一座帐篷里，身下铺着厚厚的羊皮和卡垫，身上盖着暖和的藏被，一双冰砣子似的脚，被一位藏族大娘抱在胸前用身体温暖着，灯光照在她那爬满皱纹的脸上，她头上那无数的小辫已有不少白发了。她充满慈爱的目光，使我觉得熟悉而又亲切，啊，那不是母亲看着我时的那种目光么！我情不自禁地喊了声“阿妈！”
    “菩萨保佑！你终于醒过来了，孩子！”她从牛粪火上端下一口小锅：“喝些热牛奶吧！我来喂你。”
    我摇了摇头。
    她见我不吃东西，就安慰我说：“孩子，你在发烧，卓玛已经骑马到县上给你请医生去了。”
    “阿妈，我怎么到了您的帐篷？”我疑惑地问。
    她一边用手轻轻揉搓着我的双脚活动血脉，一边就讲开了。
    原来我那匹受惊的马摔下我后，跑了10来里路到了央宗阿妈的羊圈躲风。守圈的阿妈发现半夜里跑来匹备着空鞍的马，估计是马的主人在暴风雪中遭到不测，于是叫醒女儿卓玛替她守圈，自己带上牧羊狗，牵着马顺着雪地上时隐时现的马蹄印找到了我，她把冻得昏迷的我用马驮回了帐篷。央宗阿妈的独生女儿卓玛在灯光下认出我就是为她们去县上买书的老师时，伤心得哭了起来。央宗阿妈立刻打发女儿骑马去县上请医生，她自己就一直守候在我的身边。此情此景，这来自另一个民族母亲般的爱，使我感动得鼻子直发酸。
    听着帐篷外面呼啸的北风，我意识到暴风雪还没有停止，在这样恶劣的天气里，让一个十五六岁的小姑娘夜里独自骑马走五六十里路，这有多么大的危险！
    第二天中午，县医院的救护车开来了，但卓玛没有随车回来。医生告诉我们，卓玛昨天晚上在暴风雪中冻坏了左脚，经医生会诊，决定截掉冻得坏死的脚趾。
    “菩萨，您怎么能这样对待一只无罪的小羊！”央宗阿妈抽泣着。医生的眼圈也发红了，我内疚地握着央宗阿妈的手，不知说什么才好。
    救护车拉着我就要开走了，但央宗阿妈还要照看一群即将产羔的母羊不能马上跟我们一起去看望冻伤的女儿。她爬上救护车，为我掖好被子，又给我的挎包里塞进一只镶着银底的酥油茶碗：“带上它吧，孩子。到了草原是离不开酥油茶碗的！”
    十几年过去了，今天，我凝视这只酥油茶碗，再次为央宗阿妈祝福，祝愿她幸福欢乐、吉祥如意！
