The Channel Tunnel, a project to build an underwater tunnel beneath the English Channel, is hailed as "the greatest engineering feat of the century." The British and French governments are responsible for overall planning and control, while the financing for the project is handled by the Eurotunnel Group, the company constructing the tunnel, through issuing stocks and obtaining bank loans. After securing 50 billion francs, the company began construction at the end of 1987.

For over a year, the stock of the tunnel company has been performing well, with the price per share rising from 54 francs to 126 francs in the first half of this year, making it a "star" in the stock market.

However, since mid-July, a wave of selling has hit the stock market. In French exchanges, an average of 3 million shares are sold daily, five to six times the usual trading volume. Simultaneously, the stock price has plummeted, dropping by 20% in less than a week.

Why did a stock that was previously performing well suddenly drop? Rumors spread in British exchanges, claiming that cracks had appeared in the tunnel and that parts of the construction site were flooded. More rumors suggested that construction costs had risen, leaving the tunnel company facing severe financial difficulties.

The chairman of the European Tunnel Company recently admitted that there were indeed financial difficulties due to increased construction costs. For example, the cost of the shuttle trains designed to transport cars and trucks through the tunnel had doubled. Thus, the originally planned 50 billion francs were insufficient, and an additional 100 billion francs were needed. To secure this additional funding, the tunnel company is in talks with over 200 banks. The chairman stated that the tunnel construction is progressing smoothly and will be completed as planned by the summer of 1993. Long-term investors in this project will reap substantial profits, with an estimated return of 30% from 1987 to 1995. Economic analysts also believe that, despite some risks, the additional funds required are likely to be secured.

With the truth revealed, the stock market turmoil has subsided. However, the exchange business committee has doubts about the cause of the turmoil: Why was the news of increased construction costs leaked before it was officially announced? Why did the stock market in both Britain and France experience a simultaneous plunge? It is possible that insiders from the tunnel company deliberately leaked the information to disrupt the stock market and engage in stock speculation. Investigations are currently underway.

### 欧洲隧道公司股票下跌风波

    欧洲隧道公司股票下跌风波
    英吉利海峡海底隧道工程，被称为“本世纪最伟大的工程”。对于隧道的建设，英、法两国政府只负责宏观调控，资金的筹措则由这项工程的承建者——英法“欧洲隧道集团公司”通过发行股票和银行贷款的方式解决。在筹得500亿法郎的资金后，该公司已于1987年底开始施工。
    一年多来，隧道公司的股票行情一直看好，在今年上半年的几个月内，每股的价格从54法郎上升到126法郎，成为股市上的“明星”。
    但是，今年7月中旬以来，股市上却出现了抛售隧道公司股票的狂潮。在法国的交易所里平均每天抛售出300万股，为平日交易额的五六倍。与此同时，股票的价格急骤下跌，不到一周时间，每股的价格下跌幅度达20％。
    行情一向看好的股票为何骤跌？原因在英国的交易所里谣言四起，说隧道里已出现裂缝，部分工地被水淹没了。更多的传言是工程费用上涨，隧道公司面临资金短缺的严重困难。
    欧洲隧道公司的董事长最近承认，确实出现了资金短缺的问题，因为工程的造价提高了。例如，隧道里专门运送小汽车和卡车的穿梭列车的造价就翻了一番。这样，原定的500亿法郎就远为不够，估计要增加到600亿法郎。为筹得这100亿追加资金，隧道公司正和200多家银行商谈。这位董事长说，隧道工程进展很顺利，能按原定计划在1993年夏竣工。为这项工程作长期投资者，将能获得丰厚的利润，预计从1987年到1995年，投资者可获利30％。经济分析家们也认为，虽有一定的风险，但是，要追加的资金是有可能筹措到的。
    事情的真相澄清了，股票狂跌的风波也就随之而平息了。但交易所业务委员会对这次风波的起因却产生了怀疑：为什么工程费用上涨的消息在未正式公布之前就泄露了出去？为什么在英、法的交易所里几乎同时出现狂跌的风潮？很可能是隧道公司里的知情人有意把情报捅出去，达到捣乱股市、进行股票投机的目的。目前，调查正在进行之中。
