The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army sent a condolence telegram to the Hebei Provincial Government today, representing all military personnel in expressing deep sorrow and longing for the passing of the renowned patriot and model supporter of the military, "Mother of the Soldiers," Rong Guanshu. They also extended heartfelt condolences to her family.

The telegram from the General Political Department stated that Rong Guanshu was a beacon of patriotism and support for the military. Her passing is a great loss to the soldiers, who have lost a beloved "mother." We believe that the broad masses of military and civilian personnel will turn their grief into strength, carry forward the fine traditions of supporting the military and caring for families of military personnel, and further strengthen military-civilian unity. This will help promote reform and opening up, and the Four Modernizations, achieving even greater success.
