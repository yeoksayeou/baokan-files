Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 24th.

Tibet has decided to allocate one million yuan specifically for improving the medical and health care of farmers and herdsmen. Starting from the second half of this year, the Tibet Autonomous Region government will allocate 1.1 million yuan for this purpose.

This special fund will be allocated by the Tibet Finance Department and distributed to various counties, specifically for the free medical treatment of farmers and herdsmen. The Tibet Autonomous Region government emphasizes that all levels of government must not misuse this special fund. If any misuse is found, it must be seriously dealt with. At the same time, the per capita medical fee of 3 yuan per year for farmers and herdsmen in the counties' contract amounts must not be used for other purposes due to the government's increase in special funds.

    本报拉萨8月24日电　记者刘伟报道：西藏自治区政府决定，从下半年起，拨专款110万，用于提高农牧民医疗保健水平。
    此项专款由西藏财政厅拨出，下达各县，专项用于农牧民免费医疗。西藏自治区政府强调，所属各级政府不准挪用该专款，如有挪用现象必须严肃处理。同时，各县包干基数中农牧民每人每年的3元医疗费，不能因政府增加专款而作它用。
