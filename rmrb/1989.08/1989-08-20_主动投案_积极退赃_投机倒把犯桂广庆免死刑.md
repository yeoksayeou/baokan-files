    According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on August 19, (Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Zhengjun, Legal Daily reporter Wang Qinglin) Gu Guangqing, who was sentenced to death for his involvement in a major speculation case in Wuhan, was given a reduced sentence of life imprisonment due to his voluntary surrender and active return of illicit gains.

    Gu Guangqing was formerly the director of Wuhan Metallurgical Research Institute and had served as a member of the Wuhan Municipal Political Consultative Conference and vice-chairman of the Hanyang District Political Consultative Conference. In July 1988, Gu Guangqing abused his position as director to sell 5 tons of nickel plates, which were part of the 30 tons allocated by the Metallurgical Department to Wuhan Metallurgical Research Institute, to Changsha General Electric Company, earning 45,000 yuan illegally. Later, he sold the remaining 3 tons of nickel plates to a Wuhan unemployed individual named Tao for 115,000 yuan per ton, earning 358,000 yuan illegally. In total, he illegally gained 403,000 yuan.

    On November 24, 1988, Gu Guangqing voluntarily surrendered to the Municipal Procuratorate and returned all the illicit gains.

    The presiding judge of Wuhan Intermediate People's Court stated at today's public trial that, considering Gu Guangqing's voluntary surrender and confession, as well as his active return of all illicit gains, the court decided to reduce his sentence for the crime of speculation to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life.

    主动投案　积极退赃
    投机倒把犯桂广庆免死刑
    据新华社武汉8月19日电　（新华社记者方政军、法制日报记者汪青林）论罪应判处死刑的武汉市特大投机倒把犯桂广庆，因投案自首，积极退赃今天被依法从宽判处无期徒刑。
    桂广庆原系武汉冶金研究所所长，曾担任武汉市政协常委、汉阳区政协副主席等职。1988年7月，桂广庆利用所长职权将冶金部拨给武汉市冶金研究所计划内的30吨镍板中的5吨，私下倒卖给长沙通用电器公司2吨，非法获利45000元；后又将余下的3吨镍板以每吨11.5万元的高价倒卖给武汉市无业人员陶某，非法获利35.8万余元，以上两项共获赃款40.3万余元。
    1988年11月24日，桂广庆自动到市检察院投案自首，并退回全部赃款。
    武汉市中级人民法院审判长在今天的公判会上说，鉴于桂广庆主动自首坦白，积极退还全部赃款，决定以投机倒把罪减轻判处其无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
