Premier Li Peng today met with the departing Zambian Ambassador to China, Mainza Chona, and reiterated that the Chinese government and people will always stand firmly with the governments and peoples of the frontline states, "whether in times of success or difficulty, we will be reliable friends of the peoples of the frontline states."

Li Peng said that the Chinese government and people have consistently opposed the apartheid and racial discrimination policies pursued by the South African authorities, and have sympathized with and supported the just struggles of the frontline states to maintain their independence and sovereignty.

He said, "We are pleased to see that, with the support of the international community, the peoples of Africa, especially those of the frontline states, have achieved significant results through their long and unremitting struggles, such as the start of Namibia's independence process and the easing of tensions in the southern African region." However, Li Peng added, "We are also aware that the struggle against South African apartheid and racial discrimination is not yet over. We believe that the governments and peoples of the frontline states will continue to unite and strive for this goal."

Premier Li Peng said that the Chinese government and people have always been attentive to the achievements of the Zambian people under the leadership of President Kaunda. He asked Chona to convey his warm greetings from the Chinese leadership to Kaunda.

Li Peng asked the ambassador to convey to President Kaunda upon his return to Zambia: The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has produced a new leadership core; China's political situation is stable, and the economic situation is good. The various current policies of the Party and government are supported by the broad masses of the people, "We are full of confidence in China's future."

Li Peng thanked Chona for his effective work over the five and a half years of his term in promoting friendly cooperation between Zambia and China. Chona took up his post as Zambian Ambassador to China in March 1984.

Chona said that throughout his long political career, especially during his more than five years in China, he had witnessed the sincere support and aid of the Chinese government and people for Zambia and other Third World countries. He said that China and Zambia have always been friendly, as President Kaunda had vividly pointed out: "The Zambian people are always China's 'all-weather friends.'"

    李鹏会见赞比亚离任大使时强调
    中国是非洲前线国家可靠朋友
    新华社北京8月14日电  国务院总理李鹏今天会见即将离任的赞比亚驻华大使迈因扎·乔纳时重申，中国政府和人民将始终如一地站在前线国家政府和人民一边，“不管是在顺利还是困难的情况下，我们都将是前线国家人民的可靠朋友”。
    李鹏说，中国政府和人民一贯反对南非当局奉行的种族歧视和种族隔离政策，同情和支持前线国家为维护独立和主权所进行的正义斗争。
    他说：“我们高兴地看到，非洲各国人民特别是前线国家人民，在国际社会的支持下，经过长期不懈的斗争所取得的成就，如纳米比亚已开始独立进程，南部非洲地区的局势趋于缓和。”但李鹏说：我们也清醒地看到，反对南非种族歧视和种族隔离的斗争尚未结束，我们相信前线国家政府和人民将团结一致，继续为此作出努力。
    李鹏总理说，中国政府和人民一直注视着赞比亚人民在卡翁达总统的领导下所取得的成就。他请乔纳转达中国领导人对卡翁达的亲切问候。
    李鹏请大使回国后转告卡翁达总统：中国共产党不久前举行的十三届四中全会产生了新的领导核心；中国的政局是稳定的，经济情况也是好的，党和政府的各项现行政策是得到广大人民支持的，“我们对中国的前途充满信心”。
    李鹏感谢乔纳在长达五年半的任期内为发展赞比亚和中国之间的友好合作关系所做的卓有成效的工作。乔纳于1984年3月出任赞比亚驻华大使。
    乔纳说，在他长期的政治生涯中，特别在华五年多的任职期间，他目睹了中国政府和人民对赞比亚和其他第三世界国家的真诚的支持和援助。他说，中赞两国一向是友好的，正如卡翁达总统所形象地指出的：赞比亚人民永远是中国人民的“全天候朋友”。
