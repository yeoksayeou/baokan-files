Japan's economic planning agency today released the 1989 economic white paper, stating that Japan's economic development has entered a new stage.

The economic white paper, titled "Economic Report for the First Year of Heisei," states that Japan's economy has now entered a new stage of development. The main characteristics of this stage are the "high-level" development of industries and living standards, the "globalization" of the economy, and the "assetization" of the economy.

The white paper points out that the "high-level" development of Japanese industries is the result of enterprises continuously adapting to the changing international economic environment. This development, primarily driven by microelectronics and information technology, enables enterprises to achieve high added value and low costs for their products, improve production processes and promote the development of new products, enhance information technology levels, and expand business scope.

When discussing the trend of "globalization" in the Japanese economy, the white paper states that Japan aims to achieve simultaneous development both domestically and internationally.

The "assetization" of the economy refers to the increasing proportion of financial assets and land in the national GDP. The white paper states that currently, the annual transaction volume of land and financial assets has exceeded 100 trillion yen (approximately 714.286 billion US dollars).

    日经济已进入新阶段
    据新华社东京8月8日电  日本经济企划厅今天发表的1989年度经济白皮书说，日本的经济发展目前已进入新阶段。
    题为《平成元年度经济报告》的经济白皮书说，日本经济目前已经进入新的发展阶段。其内容为产业和生活的“高级化”、经济的“全球化”和“资产化”。
    白皮书指出，日本产业的“高级化”是企业不断适应变化了的国际经济环境的结果，它是以微电子化和信息化为主进行的，产业的这种“高级化”发展使企业有可能实现产品的高增值价值和低成本、改善工艺技术和推进新产品开发、提高信息化水平和扩大经营领域。
    白皮书在谈到日本经济的“全球化”倾向时说，日本希望能达到国内和海外同时发展这两个目标。
    经济的“资产化”是指金融资产和土地等在国民总产值中所占比例不断增大。白皮书说，目前，土地和金融资产的交易规模每年已超过1亿亿日元，（约合71.4286万亿美元）。
