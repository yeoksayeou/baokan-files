The fragrance of flowers not only benefits longevity but also can improve work efficiency. Nowadays, fragrant buildings have emerged in Japan and are developing rapidly.

The famous Japanese company Shiseido, the largest producer of cosmetics in Japan, has recently launched a "fragrant building" design plan and conducted successful trials. The company advocates incorporating certain fragrant substances that people enjoy into the air conditioning system controlled by computers when building office buildings. This automated system can automatically adjust according to indoor temperature, humidity, and various natural factors, continuously releasing a fragrant scent that is refreshing to the lungs.

Recently, the Japanese company Tajima Corporation successfully conducted a comprehensive trial of this "fragrant building." More than 1,000 employees participating in the trial did not find anything unusual when they first entered the trial building. When they took their seats and prepared to work, they heard the air conditioning start and immediately smelled a faint fragrance. People suddenly became excited.

The comprehensive analysis of the trial results showed that although the participants had different preferences for various fragrances, they generally felt that working in a fragrant environment made their minds clear, their moods pleasant, and their fatigue reduced. It could also overcome midday drowsiness, and work efficiency increased significantly. The organizers of the trial said: "In Japan, where the average workweek is currently 38.7 hours, fragrant buildings have great significance and prospects for us."

According to a survey, among various fragrances, people prefer lemon and jasmine the most. Women particularly like the scent of jasmine. Therefore, related companies have arranged "jasmine office buildings (rooms)" in buildings and rooms where women are concentrated, achieving very ideal results.

    在花香中工作
    柯谱　宝成
    花卉香味不仅有益于延年益寿，而且可以提高工作效率。如今，花香建筑在日本问世，并方兴未艾地发展着。
    日本著名的资生堂公司——全日最大的装饰品生产厂家——新近已推出“芳香建筑”设计方案，并通过了试验。该公司主张在建筑办公楼时，事先把一些为人们喜闻的芳香物质注入计算机控制的空调系统。这个自动化系统可以根据室内温度、湿度、以及各种自然因素，进行适宜的自动调整，不断释放出沁人肺腑的香味。
    最近日本田岛株式会社对这种“芳香建筑”进行了成功的综合试验。参加试验的1000多名工作人员在开始进入试验大楼时并不觉得有何稀奇。当他们各就各位，准备办公时，只听得空调启动，随即嗅到阵阵幽香。人们陡然兴奋起来。
    试验结果的综合分析表明，参试者虽对各种芬香好恶不一，但总的认为在花香中办公头脑清醒，心情舒畅，疲劳消除，还可以克服中午瞌睡等现象，工作效率成倍提高。组织试验者说：“在日本眼下实行每周38.7平均工作小时的情况下，花香建筑对于我们是很有意义和前途的。”
    据调查，在各种香味中，人们对柠檬香味和茉莉香味最为欢迎。妇女尤喜茉莉花味。于是，有关公司已在妇女集中的大楼、房间，布置了“茉莉办公楼（室）”，取得了十分理想的效果。
