The Alcoholics Anonymous Association in Japan was established in 1958 and became a nationwide organization in 1963. It is officially named the "All-Japan Alcoholics Anonymous Association," with a membership of 50,000. In addition to the group singing the "Pledge to Quit Drinking," the association also performs a special song for family members called "Pledge for Family Members." After joining, members' alcohol consumption decreases to varying degrees, which is welcomed by their families.

To support the anti-alcoholism campaign, the Soviet Union produced a 50-minute wide-screen color film titled "Poison of Alcohol." The film is uniquely directed, humorous, and disgusting in its depiction of drunkenness, making even alcoholics lose their interest in drinking after watching it.

Sweden has "Alcohol Rehabilitation Hospitals" in various locations. Police can detain drunkards at any time, and then the police doctor conducts a mental examination and blood test. If someone's blood alcohol content exceeds one-tenth of one percent, they are forcibly sent to the rehabilitation hospital for a three-month treatment. In Sweden, there are no bars, and all restaurants and dining establishments are only allowed to serve a small amount of alcohol during dinner. Those who wish to drink at home must obtain a "Special Alcohol Purchase Permit" to buy alcohol from designated locations. Individuals holding such permits must pay a significant amount of tax.

    外国戒酒趣闻
    戒酒协会　日本在1958年成立戒酒协会，1963年发展成为全国性组织，正式名称为
  “全日本戒酒联盟”，会员已达5万人。在协会的活动中，除了全体合唱“戒酒誓言”外，还要专门为家属演唱“为家属之誓言”。入会后，会员酒量都有不同程度的减少，受到家属的欢迎。
    戒酒电影　苏联为配合反酗酒运动，专门拍摄了一部名为《酒毒》的宽银幕彩色片，放映时间为50分钟。这部影片编导奇特，滑稽可笑，醉酒模样又令人作呕，即使是酒鬼看后也会对酒没有好感。
    戒酒医院　瑞典各地设有
  “戒酒医院”。警察发现醉汉可随时拘留，然后由警方医官进行神志测验和血液检查，若发现谁血液中的酒精含量超过千分之一，即强迫送戒酒医院治疗3个月。在瑞典没有酒店，所有餐馆和饭店只准在晚餐时供应少量的酒。人们想在家中饮酒，要持“购酒特许证”，到指定的地点购买，而持有这种特许证的人，则要缴纳不少的税款。
