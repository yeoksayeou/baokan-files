Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Ma Chengguang and Yin Yunqiu report from Beijing: Some outstanding forest guards who have spent most of their lives in the deep mountains and forests, enduring various hardships, were invited to Beijing by the Ministry of Forestry today. They gathered to share their experiences in forest protection and discuss strategies for forest conservation.

These forest guards, who carry the scent of the earth, including forest rangers, timber inspection station inspectors, forestry station management personnel, forestry public security officers, and armed forest police, have been fighting on the front lines of forestry work for many years. To strengthen forest resource management, protect national and collective forest assets, and maintain order in the forest areas, they have done a great deal of arduous and outstanding work.

Whether in the scorching summer or the bitter winter, they often traverse mountains and rivers, either to investigate and solve cases of illegal logging on the spot, or to stand guard, resolutely fighting against those who steal and transport timber illegally. They endure humiliation and strictly enforce the law, never retreating in the face of danger and remaining unmoved by money. Some have even sacrificed their precious lives in the struggle against lawbreakers.

Minister of Forestry Gao Dezhan said, "They are indeed strong forest guards. Their lofty spirit of devotion to forestry and their spirit of hard work in the forest areas should be respected and loved by the whole society."

    基层优秀森林卫士进京共商护林大计
    本报北京8月2日讯　新华社记者马成广、本报记者尹韵秋报道：一些大半生埋迹深山老林、历尽各种艰难困苦的优秀护林工作者，今天受林业部邀请来北京，交流护林经验，共商护林大计。
    这些满身带着“土”味的护林员、木材检查站检查员、林业工作站的林政管理人员、林业公安干警和武装森林警察，常年战斗在林业工作第一线，为了加强森林资源管理，保护国家和集体的森林资产，维护林区秩序，做了大量艰苦卓绝的工作。
    不管是酷暑还是寒冬，他们经常跋山涉水，或到现场侦破盗伐案件，或坚守岗位，同盗伐偷运木材者进行坚决斗争；他们忍辱负重，严格执法，在危险面前不后退，在金钱面前不动心。有的同不法分子斗争不惜献出宝贵的生命。
    林业部部长高德占说，他们不愧为坚强的森林卫士。他们献身林业的崇高思想和身居林区艰苦奋斗的精神，应当受到全社会的尊敬和爱戴。
