People's Daily, Tegucigalpa, Caracas, August 4th.

After a full day of dialogue, the Nicaraguan government's talks with 21 political parties finally yielded results. President Daniel Ortega and representatives of various political parties signed a political agreement, guaranteeing the promotion of democratic reforms and paving the way for next year's elections and the disarmament of anti-government forces.

The political agreement calls on the heads of state of the five Central American countries to take action, in accordance with the decisions of the previous summit, to immediately disband the anti-government forces in Honduras. The Nicaraguan government, in the political agreement, pledged to simultaneously implement an unconditional amnesty, calling on relevant countries not to interfere in Nicaragua's domestic election process. President Ortega pledged to suspend conscription from this September to next February before the elections, to quickly submit to the National Assembly draft amendments to the press law, the law on maintaining order and public security, and the regulations on the judicial responsibilities of the Sandinista police. He also agreed to allow opposition parties to use official television networks during the election process and required news organizations to treat all parties equally. Both sides agreed that the president and vice president elected on February 25th next year will take office on April 25th of that year. The political agreement reached agreements on a series of detailed rules for voter registration, campaigning, voting, supervision, and verification. The agreement requires the United States to respect Nicaragua's sovereignty and prohibits the CIA from operating in Nicaragua's elections. President Ortega also pledged to continue dialogue with various domestic parties. Since the heads of state of the five Central American countries proposed at the previous meeting that the disbandment of anti-government forces should be conditional on Nicaragua's domestic democratization process, the above agreement will put Nicaragua in a favorable position at the summit.

    尼政府与反对派达成协议
    解除反政府武装  加速民主化进程
    综合本报特拉、加拉加斯8月4日电　记者郭伟成、朱满庭报道：经过整整一天的对话，尼加拉瓜政府召集的与21个政党的对话终于取得成果，奥尔特加总统与各政党代表签署了一项政治协议，保证推进民主改革，为明年的大选和解除反政府武装铺平道路。
    政治协议呼吁中美洲5国首脑会议采取行动，按照上次首脑会议的决议，立即遣散在洪都拉斯境内的反政府武装。尼政府在政治协议中承诺，将与此同时实行无条件大赦，呼吁有关国家不要干预尼加拉瓜国内的大选进程。奥尔特加总统承诺，在今年9月至明年2月大选前停止征兵，尽快向全国人大提出新闻法修改草案、取消维持秩序和公共安全法案及桑地诺警察司法职责条例的修改草案，允许反对党在大选进程中使用官方的电视网，要求新闻单位对各党派一视同仁。双方同意明年2月25日当选的总统与副总统在当年4月25日就职。政治协议对选民登记、竞选、投票、监督与核查等一系列实施细则达成了协议。协议要求美国尊重尼加拉瓜主权，禁止美国中央情报局在尼大选中进行活动。奥尔特加总统还承诺继续与国内各党派对话。由于中美洲5国首脑在上次会议中提出，遣散反政府武装应以尼加拉瓜国内民主化进程为条件。因此，上述协议将使尼加拉瓜在首脑会议上处于有利的地位。
