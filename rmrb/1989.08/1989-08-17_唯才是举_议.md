    On the Principle of "Promoting Based on Talent"
    Xī Cūnián

    Chinese ancient reformers advocated the principle of "promoting based on talent," which naturally has progressive significance. However, if this principle is interpreted to mean that talent can only be recognized through official positions, and that not being promoted to an official position means being buried or not being fully utilized, then this interpretation is flawed.

    Currently, with the implementation of reform and opening-up policies, various sectors need talent. Allowing talented individuals to take up leadership positions and play their roles is entirely appropriate. The question is, what kind of person qualifies as talent? Researchers in the field of talent studies have different answers. Some say those with senior professional titles are talented, others say those with degrees are talented, and still others say those with inventions and outstanding contributions to society are talented. If all these are considered talent, then leadership positions would hardly be able to accommodate them. For example, a university might have hundreds of professors and associate professors. If each of them were to become a president or vice-president, wouldn't the university be overwhelmed? Moreover, when a unit selects leadership cadres, talent is not the only criterion; other conditions, especially political conditions, must also be considered.

    I believe that talented individuals do not necessarily need to enter the officialdom. As long as they strive, they can become experts in various fields such as philosophy, science, literature, art, history, and education, and there is no limit to the number of such experts. For instance, Einstein was invited by the Israeli government to become the president. From the perspective of "promoting based on talent," not only should he have accepted the position, but such a high-ranking post would also be considered an honor for his family. However, Einstein firmly declined and continued to focus on his research in physics. If he had accepted the presidency, it is uncertain whether he could have governed the country well, but it is certain that he would have been overwhelmed by administrative duties, potentially ruining his talent. There are countless such examples.

    I am not saying that officials and talent are contradictory. There have always been many individuals who are both talented and successful officials. However, it is also important to recognize that not every talented person is suitable for official positions. As Han Yu said, "The understanding of the Way comes in sequence, and skills have their specializations." If one is not proficient in what they study and is hastily promoted to an official position, they will have power but will not be able to lead effectively, potentially causing harm. As for those who have no talent or learning but manage to secure official positions, they are even more harmful to the country and the people. In this regard, I think the former Chinese female volleyball stars Hou Yuzhu and Zheng Meizhu were very wise. They made significant contributions to China's women's volleyball team winning the world championship. Before retiring, a reporter asked if the organization would arrange a job for them like they did for previous team members. Hou Yuzhu clearly stated, "I have no intention of becoming an official after retiring." She also said, "We all need to learn, to learn the knowledge and skills needed by society." Listen, she does not want to become an official; instead, she wants to learn to increase her "knowledge and skills" to adapt to "societal needs." This is truly the voice of talent.

### “唯才是举”议

    “唯才是举”议
    奚椿年
    中国古代改革家倡言“唯才是举”，其进步意义自然不可低估。但如果据此演绎为人才只有当官才是天经地义，否则就是被埋没或者说没有得到重用，那就欠妥了。
    当前实行改革、开放政策，各方面都需要人才，让人才站到领导岗位上来，发挥他们的作用，完全是应该的。问题是究竟什么样的人算是人才？人才学研究者回答各不相同，有的说是有高级职称的，有的说是有学位的，有的说是有发明创造、对社会作出杰出贡献的……如果这都算人才，那领导岗位就绝难容纳得了。举个例子来说吧：一个大学的教授、副教授数以百计，个个当校长、副校长的话，学校岂不是会被“挤垮”？何况，一个单位在选拔领导干部时，才也不是唯一条件，还要考虑其它条件，特别是政治条件呢。
    我认为，有才干的人，不必都挤身官场。只要自己努力，在哲学、科学、文学、艺术、历史、教育等不同领域中都可以成为这样或那样的专家，且数量上绝无限制。当年爱因斯坦被以色列当局邀请去当总统，从“唯才是举”的眼光看来，不只是该当，而且如此“位高极品”，可谓是光宗耀祖的了。可是，爱因斯坦却断然拒绝，还是一心一意研究他的物理学。如果那时他真的坐上了总统宝座，能否把这个国家治理好且不说，单就政务而言，怕也会缠得他头昏脑胀的，倒可能会毁了他的才。这样的例子举不胜举。
    我这倒不是说官与才矛盾，既有才又当官，而且当得很好的历来很多。但是，又要看到，并不是任何一个人才都适合当官的。韩愈说得好：“闻道有先后，术业有专攻。”所攻非所学，糊里糊涂地被“举”到官位上，有了权力，瞎指挥，不但做不好工作，反而会坏事。至于那些本来就无才无学的人，居然钻营到了一官半职，更是害国害民的。在这里，我倒觉得中国前女排名星侯玉珠、郑美珠很明智，她俩为中国女排获得世界冠军立下了汗马功劳，退役前有记者问，组织上是否像安排前几任女排国手退役那样给安排个工作岗位？侯玉珠明确表示：“退役后无意当官。”还说，我们“都需要学习，学习社会需要的知识和技能。”听，不当官，要学习，以增加自己的“知识和技能”，适应“社会的需要”，这确实是人才的心声。
