The militia in Hunan Province have been actively cooperating with public security officers to maintain social order. Across the province, militia joint defense teams and small teams for protecting factories, stations, shops, roads, bridges, and lines have been universally established. In Zixing City, a few lawless elements attempted to sabotage the Dongjiang Reservoir dam. The Zizhou Military Sub-district and the Zixing City People's Armed Forces Department immediately led 400 militiamen, along with public security officers, to form three defensive lines on the Dongjiang Dam, thus protecting the dam. In Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and other places, many factory People's Armed Forces Departments have organized young militiamen to guard their posts and continue production, striving to be models of maintaining safety and unity, and to be vanguards in developing production, aiming to complete half of this year's production tasks by half of the year. The military sub-districts and People's Armed Forces Departments in the Dongting Lake area have organized militia flood prevention and rescue strike teams based on the changing flood situation in the lake area, and have made all preparations for flood relief and disaster rescue.
