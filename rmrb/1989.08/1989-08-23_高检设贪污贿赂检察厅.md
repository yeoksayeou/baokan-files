The Supreme People's Procuratorate recently decided to rename the Economic Prosecution Bureau as the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Prosecution Bureau. It also decided to consolidate the reporting and investigation work, which were previously handled by two separate departments, under the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Prosecution Bureau. This move aims to streamline the process of reporting, preliminary investigation, case filing, and investigation into a single, integrated workflow.

According to the information, approximately 80% of the cases handled by the original Economic Prosecution Department were related to embezzlement and bribery.

    高检设贪污贿赂检察厅
    新华社北京8月23日电　记者从最高人民检察院获悉，最高人民检察院最近决定将经济检察厅易名为贪污贿赂检察厅，并决定将原来分别由两个业务部门办理的举报工作和侦查工作统一归贪污贿赂检察厅办理，实行举报、初查、立案、侦查工作一条龙。
    据介绍，检察机关原经济检察部门所办理的案件80％左右是贪污、贿赂案件。
