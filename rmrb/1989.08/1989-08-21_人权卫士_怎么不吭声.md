In the early hours of yesterday, a horrifyingly mutilated body of a young boy was found near the village of Beira in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

The boy had obviously been tortured before being shot. His teeth were shattered, his body bore burns from cigarette butts, his skull was fractured, and his left eyeball had been torn out. A bullet fired at close range had pierced his heart.

Many residents in the vicinity of Beira witnessed the boy being taken away in an Israeli military jeep last Wednesday. His family soon learned of his arrest.

Every day, young souls are killed by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but why has this particular atrocity been so quickly and so thoroughly reported? It turns out that the boy was an American citizen. The autopsy confirmed that the boy's name was Hussein Jabril, aged 14, born in the United States, and of Palestinian-American descent. The boy's wrist still bore the watch he wore before his death.

The boy's parents reported the incident to the U.S. Consulate two days after it happened, detailing the circumstances, but it was not until the boy's body was found in the street that the U.S. Consul in Jerusalem demanded a detailed explanation from the Israeli authorities.

This incident in U.S.-Israeli relations is something that some people do not want to publicize, hoping to brush it off lightly. However, it is strange that the "human rights guardians" of the United States have gone silent. In the face of such a blatant violation of human rights, why are they not speaking up?

    “人权卫士”怎么不吭声
    本报记者　林皎明
    昨天凌晨，在约旦河西岸以色列占领区贝拉附近，发现一具惨不忍睹的少年尸体。
    这孩子显然是被施酷刑后遭枪杀的。他的牙齿被打碎，浑身留下香烟头灼伤的痕迹，头颅破裂，左眼珠脱落。一颗近距离发射的子弹击中他的心脏。
    贝拉附近的许多居民上星期三眼见这个少年被抓上以色列士兵的吉普车。他的家人不久得知孩子被捕。
    约旦河西岸和加沙地带每天都有死在以色列大兵枪口下的少年冤魂，怎么唯独这一起暴行这么快、这么详细地见诸报端？原来，这孩子是个美国人。验尸证明，孩子名叫侯赛因·杰布利勒，今年14岁，出生在美国，是美籍巴勒斯坦人。尸体手腕上留有杰布利勒生前所用的手表。
    孩子的父母在出事的第2天，就到美国领事馆报案，申诉原委，可直到孩子暴尸街头，美国驻耶路撒冷新闻领事才要求以色列当局作出详细交待。
    美以关系中的这桩官司，有人很不愿意声张，巴不得轻描淡写地敷衍过去。可奇怪的是，美国的“人权卫士”跑到哪里去了？面对如此践踏人权的暴行，怎么一声不吭？
