On the eve of the 28th anniversary of the construction of the Berlin Wall, the German Democratic Republic reiterated that as long as the reasons for building the wall persist, the GDR will never demolish the Berlin Wall.

The *Neues Deutschland* today published an editorial stating that at that time, some people in the West took advantage of the open borders between the two Germanys and between the GDR and West Berlin to economically sabotage the GDR and create political unrest. Some people even formulated military plans for armed invasion of the GDR. The Berlin Wall and the border facilities between the two Germanys, established on August 13, 1961 with the support of fraternal countries, prevented a war disaster and played a positive role in easing the situation between Eastern and Western Europe, promoting cooperation between the East and West, and developing relations between the two Germanys.

The GDR also took this opportunity to respond to some Westerners who repeatedly called for the demolition of the Berlin Wall. The GDR side pointed out that NATO Secretary-General Werner proposed to establish a "new European order"; West German Federal Finance Minister Weigel proposed to restore the borders of the German Empire in 1937. Under these circumstances, the GDR felt that its security was directly threatened and that the post-World War II border status was being challenged. At this time, the GDR absolutely could not demolish the Berlin Wall.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 12 - On the eve of the 28th anniversary of the construction of the Berlin Wall, U.S. President Bush today once again urged the Soviet Union to make Berlin "a place of cooperation rather than confrontation."

In a statement issued from Camp David, Bush called on the Soviet Union to work with Western countries to "eliminate the division of Berlin and Europe." Bush referred to the Berlin Wall as a "monument to an old era and failed policies."

During his visit to the Federal Republic of Germany in May this year, Bush had called on Soviet leader Gorbachev to help demolish the Berlin Wall and make Europe a complete and free Europe. However, Soviet officials have consistently stated that the demolition of the Berlin Wall is a matter for the German Democratic Republic to decide.

The *Neues Deutschland* of the German Democratic Republic published an editorial today stating that the Berlin Wall cannot be demolished because the country's security is still threatened by the West.

    在柏林墙建造28周年前夕民德报纸发表社论指出
    只要威胁在就不拆柏林墙
    布什说把柏林变为合作的地方
    新华社柏林8月12日电  民主德国在柏林墙建造28周年前夕重申，只要建墙的原因继续存在，民主德国就绝不会拆除柏林墙。
    《新德意志报》今天发表社论指出，当时西方有人利用两德之间和民主德国同西柏林之间的开放边界，对民主德国在经济上进行破坏，从政治上制造动乱；有的人制定了武装入侵民主德国的军事行动计划。1961年8月13日在兄弟国家支持下建立起来的柏林墙和两德边界设施，避免了一场战争灾难，对东西欧之间局势的缓和，东西方间的合作、两德关系的发展，都起到了积极作用。
    民主德国还借此机会对西方一些人一再要求拆除柏林墙的呼吁作了回答。民主德国方面指出，北约秘书长维尔纳提出要建立“欧洲新秩序”；西德联邦财政部长魏格尔提出重建1937年德意志帝国疆界。在这种情况下，民主德国感到自己的安全受到直接威胁，第二次世界大战后形成的边界现状受到挑战。这种时候民主德国是绝不能拆除柏林墙的。
    新华社华盛顿8月12日电  在柏林墙建造28周年的前夕，美国总统布什今天再次敦促苏联将柏林变为“一个合作的地方，而不是一个对抗的场所”。
    布什在戴维营发表的一份声明中，要求苏联同西方国家一道，“消除柏林和欧洲的分裂”。布什称柏林墙是一个“旧时代和失败政策的纪念物”。
    布什在今年5月访问联邦德国期间，曾呼吁苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫帮助拆除柏林墙，使欧洲成为一个完整和自由的欧洲。然而苏联官方人士一直表示，拆除柏林墙是由德意志民主共和国去决定的事情。
    德意志民主共和国的“新德意志报”今天发表社论说，柏林墙不能拆除，因为国家安全仍然受到西方的威胁。
