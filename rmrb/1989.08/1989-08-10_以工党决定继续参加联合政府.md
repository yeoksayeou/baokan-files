	Tel Aviv, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the Israeli Labor Party decided on August 8 that the party will continue to participate in the coalition government, with the principle of "land for peace" as the guideline for negotiations with the Palestinians.

	The report said that this decision was made after a full meeting of 1,350 central committee members, thus ending the government crisis that arose from the Likud bloc's proposal on July 5 to impose additional conditions on elections in the occupied territories.

    以工党决定继续参加联合政府
    据新华社开罗8月9日电　特拉维夫消息，以色列工党中央委员会8日决定，工党继续参加联合政府，以土地换和平作为同巴勒斯坦人进行谈判的指导原则。
    报道说，这一决定是1350名中央委员举行全会以后通过的，从而结束了由利库德集团7月5日对在被占领土的选举提出附加条件而出现的政府危机。
