Friends haven't gathered for a long time, and when they meet, they naturally ask, "How have you been recently?" "Well, how should I say it? Living an average life."

"Average," what a dispiriting word, yet it has become a common phrase on the streets these days. — The weather is average — Life is average — Love is average — Work is average. In short, many people feel that everything is average.

Today, the sky is clear, and the sun shines brightly; or it's cloudy, with a soft rain falling poetically; or perhaps on a trip in the countryside, you encounter a sudden downpour without a raincoat, so you take off your shoes and socks, roll up your pants, and walk barefoot on the muddy path, feeling the yellow mud ooze between your toes, experiencing the warmth of nature. How can one say the weather is average?

In the afternoon, you walk under the scorching sun with your hand shielding your eyes, and suddenly notice a small elm sapling growing in the cracks of an old building's wall, its roots stretching desperately towards the soil and water, growing tenaciously and bravely upwards. How can one say life is average?

After a hard day's work in the workshop, the wife returns home, quickly changing out of her greasy work clothes into a bright dress, then putting on an apron. The kitchen fills with the sound of sizzling and frying. The busy wife sneaks a moment to give her husband, who is squatting on the floor brushing his work uniform while studying English vocabulary, a kiss. How can one say love is average?

Work is frustrating, efficiency is low, and the "Report on Rational Adjustment of Production Structure" that you stayed up for several nights to write after gathering data from the archives is sleeping in the drawer of the section chief. You feel a belly full of grievances about being unappreciated. But the important thing is that you are always trying, and everyone is trying to change the situation. How can one say work is average?

Perhaps you don't have the grand vision to start a global company. Perhaps you can't win the national "March 8th Red Banner" award. Perhaps you have a wealth of knowledge but are not being utilized. Perhaps you have already retired and can't bear to remember the past when you issued orders.

But try, you can always do something to lift your spirits. Give your girlfriend an unexpected small gift. Iron your young husband's handkerchief flat and neatly, folding it and placing it in his shirt pocket. Give a friendly smile to your stranger neighbor on the bus. Revise your production conversion report again, making it more persuasive. Hold a gateball stick under your arm and quietly climb the stairs, placing a summary of your job experience on the desk that once issued countless red documents.

Do you feel it? From this moment, you become proactive. Perhaps the people around you will change subtly because of your change. Who knows, it might be like a snowball, with more and more people consciously or unconsciously becoming proactive. At that time, the whole society will quietly and firmly advance its steps in the proactive spirit of the people.

    悄悄走出“一般化”
    陈漫雪
    朋友很久没聚，见了面自然要问“最近怎么样？”“嗯，怎么说呢？活得一般化。”
      “一般化”，多让人提不起劲的词，却成了这年头街上到处飞的说法。——天气一般化——生活一般化——爱得一般化——工作一般化，总之不少人感觉一切都一般化。
    今天天晴，太阳热烈地照着；或者天阴，蒙蒙雨诗一般多情地下着；也可能在郊外的途中突遇暴雨，没穿雨衣，那么索性把鞋袜也脱掉拎在手中，挽起裤腿，深一脚浅一脚走在泥路上，看黄黄的稀泥浆从脚趾缝里溢出，感受着大自然的亲切。怎么能说天气一般化？
    午后你手搭凉篷走在烈日下，忽然发现那幢旧楼的墙缝里长出一棵小榆树苗，根须拚命向有墙土、积水的地方伸去，顽强而勇敢地向上长着。怎么能说生活一般化？
    在车间劳累一天的妻子回到家里，很快脱下油腻的工作服，换上线条明快的连衣裙，又罩上围裙，厨房里响起“嗞嗞啦啦”的炒菜声。忙得不亦乐乎的妻子偷闲拿着锅铲跑出来，给蹲在地板上边刷那件女工作服边背着英语单词的丈夫一个吻。怎么能说爱得一般化？
    工作扯皮，效率不高，你跑资料室查数据熬了几个通宵写的“合理调整生产结构的报告”躺在主任抽屉里睡大觉，憋了一肚子怀才不遇的窝囊气。可重要的是你一直在努力着，大家也都在努力着改变现况。怎么能说工作一般化？
    也许你不具备组建环宇公司的宏才大略。也许你不能问津国家“三八”红旗手奖。也许你空怀满腹才学却不被重用。也许你昨天已办了离休手续，不忍忆发号施令的过去。
    可是，试试看，你总可以做点什么使情绪不再消极的事情。送你女朋友一件出乎意料的小礼物。把年轻的丈夫的手绢熨得平平展展，叠好放进他的上衣口袋。在公共汽车上给你的陌生邻座一个友好的微笑。把你的转产报告再修改一遍，润色得更具说服力。腋下挟着门球杆悄悄爬上楼，把一份任职经验总结放在那张曾签发过无数红头文件的办公桌上。
    你感觉到了吗？从这一瞬间你变得积极起来。也许周围的人会因你的改变而发生潜移默化的改变。说不定还会像滚雪球一样，越来越多的人都自觉不自觉地变得积极。那个时候，整个社会便会在人们的积极中不露声色地坚定前行的步子。
