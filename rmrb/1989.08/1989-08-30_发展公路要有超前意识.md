	Quickly Establish a Road Development Strategy
	Road transportation has become an important component of China's social and economic development. However, China's road transportation remains backward and has become a significant constraint on the development of the national economy. This issue discusses, in connection with the situation in some countries, and based on China's actual conditions, suggestions for quickly establishing a road development strategy. — Editor

	Develop Roads with a Forward-Looking Mindset
	Inner Mongolia, Yao Zongnan

	Looking at the development of land transportation in various countries over the past 30 years, many of the economically developed countries today began to establish "road development strategies" in the 1950s or 1960s. In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress established a "road development strategy," and by the mid-1970s, the United States had built a fairly developed national road network. After the war, Japan, after a period of recovery, seized the opportunity in the mid-1950s to establish a "road development strategy"; after 30 years of construction, Japan's road transportation developed rapidly. Road transportation almost replaced railways. In Europe, Asia, and Australia, some countries that have become economically developed today, both large and small, also established "road development strategies" in the 1950s or 1960s. Due to the development of roads, transportation modernization was promoted, which in turn drove the development of the automobile manufacturing industry. The automobile manufacturing industry then drove many other industrial sectors. This multi-faceted positive feedback relationship, the original driving force all comes from the "road development strategy." This has stimulated the vitality of the entire country, greatly promoting social exchange and the development of the national economy.

	In the past, many people thought that our national conditions were suitable for the development of railways and that it was too early to develop modern road transportation. In fact, most countries established "road development strategies" not under conditions of highly developed economies and abundant capital accumulation, but rather at a relatively low economic level, even in difficult conditions. Developing roads ahead of time is a strategic choice.

	Over the past 40 years, China's road transportation has achieved some success. However, due to the long-term lack of sufficient recognition of the strategic significance of road development for the country's economic development, China's road transportation development remains backward and has become a significant constraint on the development of the national economy. Therefore, I suggest learning from the successful experiences of other countries and, in combination with China's actual situation, quickly establishing a road development strategy for China. For a long time, there has been a vague idea that there must be a considerable amount of passenger and freight traffic before investing in road construction. If this way of thinking persists, a country's transportation backwardness will be difficult to break through, and vast backward regions will only be able to sigh at the lack of roads!

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

　　尽快确立公路发展战略
    公路运输已成为我国社会经济发展的重要组成部分。但是，我国的公路运输仍然很落后，成为制约国民经济发展的重要因素。本期讨论，作者联系一些国家的情况，根据我国的实际，提出尽快确立公路发展战略的建议。　　　　　——编者
    发展公路要有超前意识
    内蒙古　姚宗南
    从近30年世界各国陆上交通的发展来看，现在的一些经济发达国家都是从五十年代或六十年代开始就确定了“公路发展战略”的。五十年代美国国会就确立了“公路发展战略”，到七十年代中期美国已建成相当发达的全国公路网。日本在战后经过一段恢复，于五十年代中期，不失时机地确定了“公路发展战略”；经过30年的建设，日本的公路运输得到了飞快的发展。公路运输几乎取代了铁路。欧洲、亚洲、澳洲一些现在经济发达起来的国家，有大国也有小国，大都也是在五十年代或六十年代确定了“公路发展战略”的。由于公路的发达，促进了运输的现代化，同时带动了汽车制造业的发达，汽车制造业又带动许多产业部门，这种多元良性循环关系，其原动力都是来源于“公路发展战略”。这就激发了整个国家的活力，大大促进了社会交流与国民经济的发展。
    过去，不少人认为，我们的国情适宜发展铁路，要发展现代化公路运输为时尚早。实际上多数国家确立“公路发展战略”都不是在经济高度发达，积累了大量资金的条件下确定的，而是在一种较低的经济水平，甚至比较困难的情况下确立的。超前发展公路是一种战略选择。
    我国的公路运输40年来取得了一定成就。但是由于长期未充分认识公路发展对国家经济发展的重大战略意义，使我国公路运输发展仍然很落后，成为制约国民经济发展的重要因素。为此，我建议，借鉴国外的成功经验，结合中国实际情况，尽快确立我国公路发展战略。长期以来，有一个模糊的观念，认为需有相当的客流、货流才能向那里投资修路。如果是这种思想，一个国家的交通滞后状态就很难突破，大片的落后地区，只能望路兴叹！
