Shenyang Third Rubber Factory mobilizes workers to tap potential, "Daily Savings of One Million Yuan" shows significant results

People's Daily, Shenyang, August 14th — Reporter Duan Xinqiang reports: In the face of severe production difficulties this year, Shenyang Third Rubber Factory launched the "Daily Savings of One Million Yuan" campaign. In the first half of the year, the factory saved 5.52 million yuan, achieving a profit and tax revenue of 27 million yuan, an increase of over 15% compared to the same period last year.

Shenyang Third Rubber Factory is the birthplace of the first rubber aircraft tires in China. Factory Director Li Jian told the reporter, "This year, as soon as we opened our doors, we faced numerous difficulties: raw materials and energy were in short supply and prices were rising. We had to absorb 25 million yuan just to maintain the same level as last year. Even with increased production and expanded profits, we still had a 3 million yuan deficit. The factory informed the workers of these difficulties, and everyone unanimously declared, 'We will overcome them!' Thus, the 'Daily Savings of One Million Yuan' campaign was launched throughout the factory.

The potential of the enterprise lies within the workers. As soon as the campaign began, each workshop was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone proposed their own savings targets. The factory emphasized practicality, avoiding unrealistic high targets, ensuring the campaign was solid and effective. The reporter saw the savings chart for the first half of the year, showing that the first, second, and third workshops had all completed more than half of their savings plans. In particular, the fourth workshop had more detailed savings measures, paying attention to every detail, and not wasting even a single piece of nylon thread. In the first half of the year, they saved 3.5 million yuan, which is 70% of their annual plan.

The 'Daily Savings of One Million Yuan' campaign has stimulated the creativity of the workers. In the first workshop, workers Sun Shaojian and Li Wangen adjusted the distance of the curtain lines during the bonding process, not only improving the quality of the tires but also saving 7 tons of nylon thread annually, worth 2 million yuan.

    沈阳第三橡胶厂发动群众挖潜
    “每日节约万元”收效明显
    本报沈阳8月14日电　记者段心强报道：沈阳第三橡胶厂在今年生产遇到严重困难的情况下，发动职工开展“每日节约万元”活动，上半年节约552万元，利税达到2700万元，比去年同期增加15％以上。
    沈阳第三橡胶厂是我国第一条橡胶飞机轮胎的诞生地。厂长李健告诉记者，今年一开门，困难真不少：原材料、能源紧张，且涨价，要消化2500万元才能与去年持平。满打满算，除增产扩利可抵消一部分涨价外，还有300万元的窟窿堵不上。厂里把困难告诉群众，职工们一致表示：“我们把它吃掉！”于是，上下齐心，“每日节约万元”活动在全厂展开了。
    企业的潜力在群众中。活动一开始，各车间热情高涨，纷纷提出自己的节约目标。厂里讲究一个“实”字，不要没把握的高指标，使活动开展得扎扎实实。记者在全厂上半年节约图表上看到，一、二、三车间都完成节约计划一半以上。特别是四车间，节约措施更细，坑里壕里都注意到，一条尼龙线也不扔掉，上半年节约35万元，占年计划的70％。
    “每日节约万元”活动激发了职工群众的创造性。一车间工人孙绍刚、李万根在挂胶时把帘子线的距离适当扩大，既提高了轮胎质量，一年又可节约尼龙线7吨，价值20万元。
