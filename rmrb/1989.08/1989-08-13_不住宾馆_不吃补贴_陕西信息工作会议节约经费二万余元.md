Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 12th.

The Shaanxi Provincial Government System Information Work Conference, which concluded on August 10th, implemented a "walking conference" approach, resulting in expenditures amounting to only one-eighteenth of similar conferences in previous years.

Over 200 people participated in this information work conference, which lasted for two days. If the traditional method of staying in hotels and receiving conference subsidies had been followed, the total expenditure would have been 28,000 yuan.

This conference adopted the "walking conference" method, where participants did not stay in hotels, did not receive conference subsidies, and did not have conference meals. The main conference hall was provided by the provincial government, and the smaller group meeting rooms were borrowed from various bureaus. The materials distributed during the conference were printed by the relevant departments. Except for the necessary expenses for those returning from out-of-province offices to stay in ordinary rooms and have meals, all other participants returned to their respective systems or units for meals. The total conference expenditure was only 1,500 yuan.
