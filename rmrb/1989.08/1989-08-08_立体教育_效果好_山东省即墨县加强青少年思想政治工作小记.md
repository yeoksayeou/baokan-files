Recently, during an interview at the Jimo County Education Bureau in Shandong Province, it was learned that the enrollment rate, retention rate, graduation rate, and universal education rate of primary schools in the entire county are all above 99%; junior high schools have sent over 1,000 new students to colleges and universities in the past two years. Among the 160,000 students in primary and secondary schools in the county, not a single student has committed a crime in the past two years. This is the result of Jimo County's emphasis on school ideological and political work, leveraging the roles of schools, society, and families to provide students with "three-dimensional education."

County leaders personally mobilize

In recent years, due to the influence of the social climate, the crime rate among young people has been increasing year by year. To strengthen ideological and political education for primary and secondary school students, the Jimo County Party Committee and the county government organized a joint investigation team in 1987 to conduct a sample survey of the moral education work in some primary and secondary schools in the county. The county secretary and county magistrate personally visited schools to understand the situation of the students. The county Party Committee and the county government issued the "Opinions on Strengthening Ideological and Political Work in Primary and Secondary Schools," which stipulated a series of assessment, reward, and punishment measures and measures. In February 1989, the county Party Committee and the county government held a full county moral education "three-in-one" meeting. County, township (town), and village party and government leaders and educators, totaling 11,200 people, attended the meeting. The county secretary and county magistrate both spoke at the meeting on how to further strengthen ideological and political education in primary and secondary schools and made arrangements. Soon, a trend of "comparing which level of government, which unit, which family does a better job in caring for the education of the next generation" emerged among all levels of party and government organizations and the people in the county. The county Party Committee and the county government timely and correctly guided this trend and forwarded the county Political Consultative Conference's "Report on the Investigation of the Jimo County Agricultural Bureau Party Committee's Strengthening of Youth Education" to the entire county, promoting their experience.

Combining teaching with education

Primary and secondary school students are in a transitional period from adolescence to adulthood. Their thoughts are active, their ability to discern is weak, and they are highly malleable. Each school, based on the students' actual thoughts, implemented a series of moral education contents by grade and level, combining the imparting of knowledge and the development of intelligence with socialist ideological and moral education, closely linking teaching with education. The schools restored and established the practice of raising the national flag and singing the national anthem; conducted education on the "Student Code of Conduct" and "Daily Behavior Norms for Primary and Secondary School Students"; carried out activities such as learning from Lei Feng, striving for the "Three Good" (good student, good classmate, good child), and creating civilized schools, civilized classes, and civilized young people; invited the military to conduct military training in schools, and invited veterans from the Old Mountain Front, old workers, and labor models to give special lectures in schools. In the student conduct evaluation method, they implemented the reform of "the average score of evaluations from the student, group, parents, and class as the conduct score." This not only helps students correctly recognize and educate themselves but also greatly mobilizes the educational enthusiasm of all parties, which is beneficial for target management. Last year, they also promoted the "Little Class Leader Activity" of the 28th Middle School throughout the county, where each student takes turns being the class leader for a day in the class, which exercises the students and improves their awareness and sense of responsibility for caring for the collective.

The whole society cares for the next generation

Starting from 1988, many party and government agencies, enterprises, and institutions in this county successively established mass organizations—"Care for the Next Generation Association" ("Care Association")—to assist schools in conducting ideological education for primary and secondary school students in a planned and targeted manner. The judicial bureau and procuratorate established legal education liaison points in schools. The court and public security bureau produced audio and video recordings of criminal interrogations and provided specific cases to conduct legal education for students in combination with reality. Sentencing meetings were held on Sundays so that students could participate and receive living legal education. Some factories and enterprises also provided practical education activity venues for schools. In addition to regular home visits, schools also stipulated "Parent School Day," where parents and class teachers meet once a month to exchange information about students' performance in and out of school, with a focus on studying how to help backward students. Urban and township schools opened "Parent Schools," where experienced teachers lectured to student parents on educational psychology, and invited parents who had successfully educated their children to share their experiences, inspiring parents to help individual parents change their rough education methods and practices of indulgence and favoritism. Through learning and exchange, parents generally improved their methods of educating their children.

    “立体教育”效果好
    ——山东省即墨县加强青少年思想政治工作小记
    崔振玉
    最近在山东省即墨县教育局采访时获悉，全县小学的入学率、巩固率、毕业率、普及率均在99％以上；中学两年向大专院校输送新生1000多名。全县16万中小学在校生两年来无一人触犯法律。这是即墨县重视学校思想政治工作，发挥学校、社会、家庭的作用，对学生进行“立体教育”的结果。
  县长县委书记出面动员
    近几年来，由于受社会大气候的影响，社会青少年犯罪率逐年上升。为了加强对中小学学生的思想政治教育，即墨县委、县政府1987年组织联合调查组对全县部分中小学的德育工作进行了抽样调查，书记、县长亲自到学校了解学生情况。县委、县政府下发了《关于加强中小学思想政治工作的意见》，规定了一系列考核、奖惩办法及措施。1989年2月，县委、县政府又召开全县德育“三干会”，县、乡（镇）、村的党政主要负责人和教育工作者11200人参加了会议，县委书记和县长都在会上就如何进一步加强中小学思想政治教育提出要求，做了部署。很快，在全县各行各业各级党政组织和百姓中出现了“比比看看哪级政府、哪个单位、哪个家庭在关心教育下一代中做得好”的攀比风。县委、县府及时正确引导，并向全县转发了县政协《对农牧局党委加强青少年教育的考察报告》，推广他们的经验。
  把教书与育人联系起来
    中小学生是由少年向青年过渡的时期，他们的思想活跃，辨别力差，可塑性强。各学校针对学生的思想实际，按年级、分层次实施了系列化的思想品德教育内容，将传授知识、发展智力与社会主义思想道德教育结合起来，把教书和育人紧密结合起来。恢复和建立了升国旗、唱国歌制度；进行《中小学生守则》、《中小学生日常行为规范》教育；开展了学雷锋、争三好，创文明学校、文明班级、文明青少年活动；请解放军进校军训，请老山前线战士、老工人、劳动模范到学校作专题报告。在学生操行评定方法上进行了“本人、小组、家长和班级4方面评定打分后的平均分为操行分数”的改革，这样不仅有利于学生正确认识自己、教育自己，同时也极大地调动了各方面的教育积极因素，有利于目标管理。去年，他们又在全县推广了28中的“小班长活动”，在班级中实行每人轮流当一天班长，使学生受到了锻炼，提高了关心集体的自觉性和责任感。
    全社会关心下一代
    从1988年起，这个县许多党政机关、企事业单位相继成立了群众组织——“关心下一代协会”（“关协”），有计划、有针对性地协助学校做中小学生的思想教育工作。司法局、检察院在学校建立了法制教育联络点，法院、公安局制作提审罪犯的录音、录像和提供具体案例，结合实际对学生进行法制教育，宣判大会安排在星期天举行，为的是让学生参加，接受活生生的法制教育。有些厂矿企业还为学校提供实践教育活动场所。学校除定期进行家访外，还规定了“家长访校日”，家长和班主任每月会面一次，交流学生在校内、外的情况，重点研究如何帮助后进生。城、镇学校开办了“家长学校”，让有经验的教师给学生家长讲授教育学、心理学，还请教育子女有方的家长现身说法，介绍教育子女的经验，发动家长启发家长，帮助个别家长改变粗暴的教育方法和溺爱、护短的做法。通过学习、交流，家长们普遍改进了对子女的教育方法。
