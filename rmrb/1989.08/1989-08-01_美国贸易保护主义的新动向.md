Since the 1980s, as the U.S. trade deficit has gradually widened, trade protectionism in the country has intensified, and the principle of "free trade" is being replaced by "managed trade" and "fair trade" principles. Bilateralism is strengthening, and the use of "gray area measures" has significantly increased.

The "Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act" passed by the U.S. last year has a strong flavor of trade protectionism. For example, the law added the "Super 301" and "Special 301" provisions. The former is aimed at foreign countries that set up trade barriers against U.S. products and services; the latter is aimed at intellectual property protection issues. These two provisions stipulate that the U.S. Trade Representative's Office can identify countries that restrict U.S. market access or do not provide adequate and effective protection for intellectual property. The office can then conduct investigations and take retaliatory measures against these countries' unfair trade practices. The law also requires the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to submit an annual "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" to Congress by April 30, strengthening the U.S. government's unilateral retaliatory capabilities. On April 28, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office released a "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers," accusing Japan, Brazil, India, and 31 other countries and regions, as well as two trading blocs, of setting up trade barriers against U.S. exports. At the same time, according to the "Special 301" provision on intellectual property, 25 countries and regions were placed on a watch list for failing to provide adequate and effective protection for U.S. intellectual property and for refusing market access to U.S. companies that rely on intellectual property. Among them, China, Brazil, South Korea, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand were placed on the priority watch list.

The U.S. has changed its trade policy and launched attacks on its trading partners using the "Super 301" and "Special 301" provisions for deep-seated reasons:

Firstly, the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has slowed. In 1988, the U.S. trade deficit improved significantly, dropping from $171.2 billion the previous year to $135.7 billion. However, in the fourth quarter of last year, the trade deficit increased again due to a lack of increase in exports and unchanged import demand. Although the deficit improved slightly in the first four months of this year, the upward trend in the dollar exchange rate will weaken export momentum. In recent years, U.S. manufacturing has undergone a massive wave of corporate mergers and acquisitions, strengthened technological upgrades in traditional industries, and streamlined and rationalized enterprises, leading to improved labor productivity. However, the export competitiveness of the manufacturing sector is still not as strong as some Asia-Pacific countries and the European Community. Many industries that once led the way, such as semiconductors, home appliances, and automobiles, have lost their advantages, and even the aerospace industry, which has long been a leader, is facing the risk of losing competitiveness. Currently, the U.S. savings rate is still far below that of its allies, and the habit of spending lavishly is difficult to change in the short term. It seems that the trade deficit this year will only improve slightly. Faced with the still enormous trade deficit, U.S. politicians and the public cannot ignore its serious political consequences. At the same time, the U.S. debt burden is becoming increasingly severe, with foreign debt exceeding $500 billion last year, which will further jeopardize the U.S. position in the world. Therefore, the U.S. has no choice but to take drastic unilateral measures to pressure trading partners to open their markets.

The rise in the dollar exchange rate has forced the U.S. to take countermeasures. Since late 1985, the dollar has depreciated significantly, which has played a positive role in improving U.S. export competitiveness and reducing the trade deficit. However, due to the limited effect of exchange rate adjustments on export competitiveness and the resurgence of inflation due to economic overheating, the U.S. government has shifted its focus to curbing inflation. Interest rates have risen, leading to a rapid appreciation of the dollar. By mid-June, the dollar's exchange rate against the yen and the Deutsche Mark had risen by approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, compared to the beginning of the year. U.S. authorities recently stated that the current dollar exchange rate is appropriate and have no intention of stopping its recent developments. In this situation, the U.S. will increasingly rely on trade measures rather than monetary measures to reduce the trade deficit, that is, by opening up the markets of its old trading partners to increase U.S. trade exports.

Furthermore, the U.S. believes that its major trading partners have not opened up their exports to the U.S. sufficiently. In recent years, Western countries have coordinated policies such as adjusting exchange rates and opening markets in surplus countries, which have had some effect in correcting trade imbalances. However, the problem is far from solved. Last year, Japan's trade surplus only decreased slightly, while West Germany's surplus continued to rise. Notably, last year, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan accounted for 44% of its total deficit, and in February and March of this year, it accounted for 53% and 67%, respectively. Therefore, Japan is at the top of the list of countries conducting unfair trade practices this time.

The U.S. also believes that West Germany and South Korea have been ineffective in reducing their trade surpluses with the U.S.

Intellectual property protection issues are directly related to the improvement of the U.S. trade deficit. Intellectual property (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, software, etc.) has always played a very important role in U.S. foreign economic relations. After the war, the U.S. relied on its technological leadership to achieve extraordinary success in economic and trade development. The export of technology drove the export of goods, and U.S. trade was in a surplus position for a long time. However, through the international exchange of intellectual property, Japan and Western Europe, among other countries, have benefited greatly. In particular, Japan has used U.S. advanced technology to mass-produce and innovate, gradually taking over the U.S. market. Japanese products have also entered the U.S. market in large quantities, exacerbating the contradictions among developed countries over intellectual property. Since the late 1970s, the U.S. trade position has rapidly declined, and the trade deficit has continued to widen. Therefore, the U.S. has taken the lead in raising the issue of intellectual property protection.

The U.S. can no longer control the multilateral trade system to serve its interests. In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. was able to use the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to a considerable extent to serve its interests. However, since the mid-1970s, as the U.S. hegemonic position has weakened and the number of countries participating in the organization has increased significantly, many issues have become difficult to resolve through the multilateral trade system in a way that is favorable to the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. has adopted a two-pronged approach, on the one hand, working to strengthen the role of GATT and promote multilateral trade negotiations to solve some problems in global trade, and on the other hand, taking various bilateral actions, even ignoring domestic and international opposition, to take unilateral measures.

The new development of U.S. trade protectionism has caused strong dissatisfaction and widespread concern among various countries, fearing that it will inevitably lead to a trade war, strain relations between major trading countries, and have an adverse impact on the development of world trade. Various countries generally criticize the U.S. for unilateral actions that violate the principles of GATT.

However, Western countries acknowledge that sustained, severe trade imbalances and slow progress in structural adjustments are the root causes of trade protectionism and international trade friction.

Due to the rise of U.S. trade protectionism, trade friction between the U.S. and countries around the world, especially Western countries, will intensify. However, the U.S. and its Western trading partners may still reach some compromises on certain issues to ease tensions for their own interests. This is a trend worth noting.

    美国贸易保护主义的新动向
    倪薇芬
    80年代以来，随着美国对外贸易逆差的逐渐扩大，贸易保护主义在这个国家日趋强烈，“自由贸易”原则正在被“管理贸易”、“公正贸易”原则取代，双边主义倾向在加强，“灰色区域措施”的使用大为增加。
    去年美国通过的《综合贸易法》具有浓厚的贸易保护主义色彩。
    例如，该法增加了“超级301条款”和“特殊301条款”，前者是针对外国对美国产品和劳务出口设置进口壁垒；后者是针对外国对知识产权保护问题。这两个条款规定，美国贸易代表办公室对于限制美国进入其市场的国家，或对知识产权没有提供充分有效保护的国家进行认定，并可自行根据301节对上述国家不公正贸易的做法进行调查和采取报复措施；要求美国贸易代表办公室每年4月30日以前向国会提交一份按国别的“国家贸易估计报告”，以强化美国政府的单边报复能力。4月28日美国贸易代表办公室发表了一份“关于外国贸易壁垒的全国贸易估计报告”，指责日本、巴西、印度等34个国家和地区以及两个贸易集团对美国的出口设置贸易壁垒。同时，根据关于知识产权的“特殊301条款”将25个国家和地区列入观察名单，因其未能充分有效地保护美国的知识产权和拒绝那些依靠知识产权的美国公司进入市场。其中中国、巴西、南朝鲜、印度、沙特阿拉伯、墨西哥、台湾、泰国被列入重点观察名单。
    美国改变贸易政策，启用“超级301条款”和“特殊301条款”向其贸易伙伴发起进攻有其深刻的原因：
    首先是美国贸易逆差改善趋慢。1988年美国贸易逆差出现了较大的改善，即从上年的1712亿美元降至1357亿美元，但去年第四季度由于出口并没有增加，而进口需求仍未减少，贸易逆差又出现增长，今年头四个月虽继续有所改善，但随着美元汇率上升，出口的势头将趋减弱。近年来美国制造业通过规模巨大的企业兼并浪潮，对传统工业技术改造的加强以及企业的精简和合理化，劳动生产率有所提高，但制造业的出口竞争力仍不如某些亚太国家和欧共体。许多曾一度领先的行业如半导体、家用电器、汽车业已失去优势，甚至连一直领先的航天航空业也面临失去竞争力的危险。目前美国的储蓄率仍远低于其盟国，大手大脚花钱的习惯短期内难以改变。看来今年的贸易逆差将只有小幅度的改善，面对依然十分庞大的贸易逆差，美国朝野不得不考虑其严重的政治后果。同时，美国债务负担日趋严重，去年外债已逾5000亿美元，这将进一步危及美国在全世界的地位。因此，美国只能孤注一掷，采取单方面的断然措施，压贸易伙伴对其开放市场。
    美元汇价上升迫使美国采取对付措施。1985年后期以来，美元汇价大幅下跌，对提高美国出口竞争力、改善贸易逆差起了积极作用，但由于汇率调整对出口竞争力的提高有一定的限度，而且由于经济过热，去年以来通货膨胀又有复燃之势，美国政府已将重点放在制止通货膨胀上，利率一升再升，导致美元迅速升值，截至6月中旬，美元对日元和西德马克的汇价，比年初分别升约15％和18％。美国当局最近表示，目前美元处在合适水平，对美元汇价最近发展无意制止。在这种情况下，今后美国将更加依赖贸易措施而较少依赖货币措施来削减贸易逆差的政策，即通过其老贸易伙伴开放市场，以增加美国的贸易出口。
    另外，美国认为，主要贸易伙伴对美出口开放程度不够。近年来，西方各国通过政策协调如调整汇率、贸易顺差国开放市场等，对纠正贸易失衡起了一定作用，但问题远没有解决。去年日本的贸易顺差仅有少量下降，西德顺差则持续上升。尤其值得注意的是去年美国对日本的贸易逆差占其总逆差的44％，今年2、3月份更分别占53％和67％。因此，这次列出的进行不公正贸易的重点名单中日本名列榜首。
    美国还认为西德和南朝鲜在削减对美贸易顺差方面十分不力。
    知识产权保护问题已直接关系到美国贸易逆差的改善。知识产权（包括专利权、版权、商标、软件等），在美国对外经济关系中一直占非常重要的地位。战后，美国依靠其技术力量的领先，在经济、贸易发展上取得过非凡的成就。技术的出口带动了商品的出口，美国的贸易曾长期处在盈余的地位。但通过知识产权的国际交流，日本和西欧等国受益匪浅。特别是日本，利用美国的先进技术大量仿制和创新，不断夺取了美国商品的市场。日本的产品还大量进入美国市场，从而使发达国家之间在知识产权上矛盾日益尖锐。70年代后期以来，美国贸易地位急剧下降。贸易逆差日趋扩大。于是，美国率先提出知识产权保护问题。
    美国已难驾驭多边贸易体制为其服务。50年代和60年代，美国在关贸总协定中在相当程度上能利用该组织为其利益服务，但70年代中期以来，随着美国霸主地位的削弱，加上参加该组织的国家大大增加，很多问题已很难通过多边贸易体制取得有利于美国的结果。因此，美国采取双管齐下的方针，一方面致力于增强关贸总协定的作用，促进多边贸易谈判，以解决全球贸易中的一些问题，一方面采取各种双边行动，甚至不顾国内外反对，采取单边措施。
    美国贸易保护主义的新发展，已引起各国强烈不满和普遍关注，担心这将不可避免地导致贸易战，造成主要贸易国之间关系紧张，对世界贸易发展造成不利影响。各国普遍指责美国单边行动违反了关贸总协定原则。
    但是，西方各国承认，持续的、严重的贸易失衡以及结构调整进展迟缓，是贸易保护主义和国际间贸易磨擦的根源。
    由于美国贸易保护主义抬头，美国同世界各国特别是西方国家之间的贸易磨擦将日益加剧。但是，美国和它的西方贸易伙伴为了自身的利益，还可能在某些问题上达成一些妥协，以缓和矛盾。这方面的动向值得注意。
