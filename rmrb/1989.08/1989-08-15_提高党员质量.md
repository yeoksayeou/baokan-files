Editor's Note:

The actions of Communist Party members serve as a mirror. The quality of party members directly affects the party's prestige among the people, as well as the party's fate and the country's future.

What should a Communist Party member be like? The Party Constitution stipulates: "A member of the Communist Party of China is a vanguard fighter of the Chinese working class with communist consciousness." The Party's advanced nature is embodied by the advanced nature of its members. Therefore, from the moment they take the oath of joining the Party, every member must support the Party's program, observe the Party's constitution, fulfill their duties as a party member, carry out the Party's resolutions, strictly observe Party discipline, keep Party secrets, be loyal to the Party, work actively, strive for communism throughout their life, and be ready to sacrifice everything for the interests of the Party and the people at any time. If party members play their vanguard and exemplary role well, the Party's style of work will improve, the Party's cohesion and fighting strength will be enhanced, and the Party's leadership position will be secured.

If we ask why the prestige of the Communist Party among the people is not as high as it used to be, one of the main reasons is the decline in the quality of party members. Among the 47 million party members nationwide, there are quite a few who do not meet the standards, and there are also some who are corrupt. Therefore, in the new historical period of reform and opening up, it is an extremely important issue in Party building to adhere to the basic qualifications of party members and improve their quality.

To improve the quality of party members, first of all, we must strictly control the admission of new members, accepting new party members according to the standards of a Communist Party member. We must attract excellent elements into the Party, but we must not allow those who do not meet the standards to join. Secondly, we must strengthen the regular ideological education of the broad masses of party members, so that they always remember that they are Communist Party members and understand the significance of the honorable title of a Communist Party member. Currently, it is particularly important to focus on education regarding communist beliefs, wholeheartedly serving the people, and integrity. This will ensure that all party members stand firm in the face of major issues, strive and dedicate themselves in all work and social life, and resist temptation in the face of money and material goods. Thirdly, we must handle organizational matters well. For those who do not meet the standards and do not improve after education, we must use methods such as persuasion and expulsion to make them leave the Party organization. For those who violate laws and discipline, we must handle them all.

As long as we combine party member education and organizational handling work organically and do a good job of it, the advanced nature of party members and the purity of the Party organization will be guaranteed. Undoubtedly, the quality of party members will also be improved, and the people will genuinely praise the Communist Party from the bottom of their hearts.

### 提高党员质量

    提高党员质量
    共产党员的行动是一面镜子。党员的质量如何，直接关系到党在人民群众中的威望，关系到党的命运和国家的前途。
    共产党员应该是什么样的人？党章规定：“中国共产党党员是中国工人阶级的有共产主义觉悟的先锋战士。”党的先进性，是由党员的先进性而体现的。因此，每一个党员，从入党宣誓起，就要做到拥护党的纲领，遵守党的章程，履行党员义务，执行党的决议，严守党的纪律，保守党的秘密，对党忠诚，积极工作，为共产主义奋斗终身，为党和人民的利益随时准备牺牲一切。党员的先锋模范作用发挥得好，党风就会好，党的凝聚力、战斗力就会增强，党的领导地位就有保证。
    如果要问，现在共产党在人民群众中的威信为什么不如过去那么高了？重要的原因之一是党员质量下降。在全国4700万党员中，不合格的党员为数不少，党的败类也非个别。因此，在改革开放新的历史时期，坚持党员基本条件，提高党员质量，是党的建设中一个极其重要的问题。
    要提高党员的质量，首先要把好入党关，依照共产党员的标准，接收新党员。既要把那些优秀分子吸收到党内，又绝不能把不够条件的人拉进党。其次，要加强对广大党员经常性的党性教育，使他们随时随地想到自己是一名共产党员，懂得共产党员这一光荣称号的份量。当前，尤其要抓好共产主义信念、全心全意为人民服务和廉洁奉公教育，使全体党员在大是大非面前，站稳立场；在一切工作和社会生活中，艰苦奋斗，勇于奉献；在金钱物质面前，不被诱惑。第三，做好组织处理工作。对于不合格的党员经教育又不改的，要采取劝退、清除等办法，让他们离开党组织。对于那些违法乱纪的党员，有多少就应处理多少。
    只要我们把对党员教育和组织处理工作有机地结合起来，抓紧做好，党员的先进性和党组织的纯洁性就有了保证。无疑，党员质量也就随之提高了，人民群众就会从内心深处称赞共产党。
