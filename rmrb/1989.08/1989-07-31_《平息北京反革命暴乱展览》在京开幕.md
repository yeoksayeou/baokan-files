The exhibition "Suppressing the Beijing Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion" opened today at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing. The exhibition is jointly organized by the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The exhibition, which opened this morning, was inaugurated by Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and Yang Baibing, a member of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department.

The exhibition is divided into five sections: The Truth and Essence of the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion; The Wise Decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission; The Loyal Guardians of the Republic; The Contributions of the People of the Capital to Suppressing the Rebellion; and Thoroughly Suppressing the Rebellion and Continuing to Advance. It features 400 photographs and approximately 2,000 exhibits. The exhibition powerfully exposes the conspiracies of a small number of people against the Party and socialism, as well as the criminal acts of the counter-revolutionary rioters. It reflects the great victory achieved in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion by the martial law troops and the people of the capital under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, who united as one and fought bravely.
