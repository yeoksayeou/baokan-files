	Tomorrow (August 17th) marks exactly 400 days until the opening of the 11th Asian Games. On this occasion, Beijing will launch another week-long campaign to welcome the Asian Games. At the same time, Beijing will prepare a series of activities and measures to combine welcoming the Asian Games with strengthening the city's spiritual civilization and comprehensive management, creating a beautiful environment and maintaining good order.

	To this end, today the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government held a mobilization meeting at the Moon Block Gymnasium with the participation of more than 2,500 people. The meeting was presided over by Mayor Chen Xitong. Li Sixian, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, and Deputy Secretaries Li Qiyang and Zhang Baifeng gave mobilization speeches at the meeting. They called on all citizens of Beijing to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, to build national self-confidence and pride, and to regard hosting the Asian Games as a glorious duty that every Beijing citizen cannot shirk. They pointed out that after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, holding this international sports event in Beijing is even more significant and has drawn more attention from the world. The people of Beijing must not disappoint the trust of the Asian people and the entrustment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They must work together to prepare the material conditions and spiritual civilization, and do everything possible to make the Asian Games a success.
