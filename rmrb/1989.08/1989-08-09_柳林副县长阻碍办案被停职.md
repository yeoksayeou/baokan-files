    Deputy County Head of Liu Lin, Shanxi Province, Gao Aiyou, obstructed and interfered with the investigation of a case, and has recently been suspended by the Liu Liang Regional Discipline Inspection Commission and the Liu Liang Administrative Office. Gao Aiyou is one of the key informants in the case of the county's illegal sale of poverty alleviation vehicles. When the investigation team questioned Gao about whether the county's Township and Village Enterprises Bureau Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Liu Tuan purchasing two poverty alleviation vehicles was approved by him, Gao shouted loudly: "Liu Tuan is also a citizen of Liu Lin. If others can buy, Liu Tuan can also buy." In response to Gao Aiyou's mistakes, the Liu Liang Regional Discipline Inspection Commission and the Administrative Office decided to suspend him for investigation.

    柳林副县长阻碍办案被停职
    本报太原电　记者王艾生报道：山西省柳林县副县长高爱友抵制、阻碍查处案件，最近被中共吕梁地区纪委、吕梁行署停职。高爱友是该县倒卖扶贫汽车案件的重要知情人之一。调查组向高调查，问到该县乡镇企业局供销公司刘团购买两辆扶贫汽车是不是他批的时候，高大声叫喊：“刘团也是柳林的一个公民，别人能买，刘团也能买。”针对高爱友的错误，吕梁地区纪委、行署决定其停职检查。
