The fourth National Star Program Work Conference, which concluded this afternoon, reiterated that the Star Program's purpose, content, and policies remain unchanged. The conference emphasized the need to raise the banner of the Star Program higher and to quickly turn the spark into a blazing flame.

The fourth National Star Program Work Conference was held in Lanzhou from August 16 to 19. The conference gave a high evaluation of the implementation of the Star Program.

Delegates at the conference used numerous facts to illustrate that the Star Program, in accordance with the "short, flat, fast" requirements, has promoted the development and application of advanced technologies. It has planted the "embryo" of science and technology in the rural economy, making full use of the natural and social resources of the regions and enterprises that have benefited from the Star Program. Labor productivity has increased several times over. For example, the more than ten thousand Star Program demonstration points scattered across the country have strengthened the scientific consciousness of millions of cadres and the masses, igniting their strong desire for technology. A large number of scientific and technological achievements have been applied in rural areas, a large number of scientific and technological leading economic entities have been established, and a large number of pillar industries that drive local economic takeoff have been developed, demonstrating the powerful driving force of the Star Program for the revitalization of the rural economy.

The conference focused on the topic of vigorously developing regional pillar industries to create a new situation for Star Program work. The experience of many regions shows that promoting the economic revitalization of a region, although the chosen breakthrough points are different and the measures and methods taken are not exactly the same, all involve forming and vigorously developing several pillar industries within a region.

The conference required that at all levels of science and technology departments, in the implementation of the Star Program and the promotion of "science and technology for rural development," they should take the formation and development of regional pillar industries as the key focus of their work for the next period.

    全国星火计划工作会议重申
    星火计划宗旨不变
    本报兰州八月十九日电  记者张述圣报道：今天下午结束的第四次全国星火计划工作会议重申，星火计划的宗旨不变，内涵不变，政策不变。要更高地举起星火计划的旗帜，让星星之火尽快形成燎原之势。
    第四次全国星火计划工作会议八月十六日至十九日在兰州举行。会议对星火计划的实施给以高度评价。
    与会代表用大量事实说明，星火计划按照“短、平、快”的要求，推动先进技术的开发与应用，将科技的“胚胎”植入农村经济，使受惠于星火计划的地区和企业的自然、社会资源得到利用，劳动生产率成倍提高。如繁星点点撒遍全国的一万多个星火项目示范点所发出的无声呼唤，强化了亿万干部群众的科技意识，引发出他们强烈的求技若渴的欲望。一大批科技成果在农村应用，一大批科技先导性经济实体的兴办，一大批带动地方经济腾飞的支柱产业的发展，显示了星火计划对农村经济振兴的强大推动力。
    大力发展区域性支柱产业，开创星火工作的新局面，是这次会议的主要话题。许多地区的经验表明，促进一个地区的经济振兴，尽管选择的突破口不同，采取的推动措施和办法不完全一样，但无一不是在一个区域内形成并大力发展若干支柱性产业。
    会议要求各级科技部门在实施星火计划和开展“科技兴农”时，都要把推动区域性支柱产业的形成与发展作为今后一个时期的工作重点。
