Title: Fighting Corruption Cannot Rely Solely on Tips

	Fighting corruption cannot rely solely on tips. Mass tip-offs are a good measure for rectifying party discipline and punishing corruption, especially for those illegal and disciplinary actions that are conducted secretly and known only to a few people. Tip-offs from those who know the situation can be quite effective. However, if the focus of anti-corruption work is solely on handling tip-offs, it would be somewhat one-sided. The party's disciplinary inspection work and the government's supervision work are not the same as the criminal law's "complaint-based prosecution," where "if the people do not complain, the officials do not investigate."

	The reason for saying this is that recently, I have heard of a few anti-corruption cases that have given me some thoughts. For example, several bureau-level cadres used public funds amounting to tens of thousands of yuan to renovate their homes. The public reported it, and it was also seriously handled. This is, of course, good. It is known that if the public reports and the leaders do not investigate, or even if they investigate, they turn major issues into minor ones and minor ones into nothing, such situations are not rare. But if we think more deeply, if we push further, large-scale construction is obviously a public matter, right? Other leaders who visit their homes must be there, right? Their renovation funds are to be reimbursed, right? Such things should be handled by daily disciplinary inspection work. But it was not handled, and only after the tip-off was it handled. Shouldn't the disciplinary inspection department of that unit learn a lesson and improve their work? There are many similar cases, such as using public funds for banquets and public-funded travels. These are all done openly, so why wait for tip-offs? Handle them directly! If known matters are not handled and only after tip-offs are made are they investigated, can it still be considered an achievement of anti-corruption work? It is worth considering.

	Fighting corruption and promoting integrity needs tip-offs, but should not wait for tip-offs. Clarifying the relationship between tip-offs and normal anti-corruption work, and organically combining the two, can make anti-corruption work better and more convincing to the people.

    肃贪不能光靠举报
    景天光
    群众性的举报工作，是端正党风、惩治腐败的一项好措施，特别是对那些隐秘进行、只有少数人了解情况的违法违纪行为，发动知情人举报，作用较大。但如果把廉政工作的重点都放在处理举报上，那就未免失之偏颇了。党的纪检工作、政府的监察工作同刑法上的“告诉才处理”，即“民不告，官不究”毕竟是不能等同的。
    之所以这样说，是因为最近听到几起廉政案件心有所感。例如，有几位局级干部动用万元公款装修住房，群众举报了，也严肃处理了。这当然很好。要知道，群众举报，领导不查，或者虽然查了，大事化小，小事化了，这种情况并不是很少的。但事情怕细想，如果再深一步推究，大兴土木这样的事不是明摆的吗？到他们家中去的其他领导干部总是有的吧！他们的装修款不是要拿去报销吗？这种事日常的纪检工作就该办。可是却没办，待举报之后才办。那该单位的纪检部门不是也应该吸取一点教训，对工作加以改进吗？类似的事是不少的，比如公款吃喝、公款旅游，这些事都是明着干的，何须等着举报？处理就是了！如果对明知道的事不处理，等人举报了才去查，还算廉政工作的成绩，就值得考虑了。
    肃贪倡廉需要举报，但不应坐等举报。弄清举报与正常廉政工作的关系，把两者有机地结合起来，才能把廉政工作做得更好，让群众信服。
