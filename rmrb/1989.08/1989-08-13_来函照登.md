People's Daily:

On July 31st, the fifth edition of the People's Daily published an article titled "Still the Soldiers of Yesteryear." In the sentence "rescued more than 60 people including Jiao Ruogu," there was an error. Jiao Ruogu was not among the "more than 60 people." This mistake was due to the author's incorrect note-taking during the interview. This will serve as a lesson for the future.
