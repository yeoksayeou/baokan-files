    Full Chinese Character Encoding Technology Successfully Developed

    BEIJING, Aug. 11 (Xinhua) — Reporter Jiang Jianke reports: The "Full Chinese Character Encoding Input and Character Output Technology" jointly developed by Taiwanese computer expert Mr. Zhu Bangfu and the Computer Laboratory of the Shenzhen Science and Technology Industrial Park was successfully tested today in Beijing under the supervision of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    This technology decomposes the shapes of all Chinese characters into 108 basic structural components, which are categorized and arranged on 24 English letter keys. At the same time, a set of simple and easy-to-learn coding rules is established, allowing for the encoding of 6 million character shapes, including 60,000 characters found in Chinese dictionaries. This scheme is particularly suitable for large-scale data processing in fields such as ancient book compilation and research, bibliographic information, and household registration management, where other methods are difficult to implement.

    全汉字编码技术开发成功
    本报北京8月11日讯  记者蒋建科报道：由台湾电脑专家朱邦复先生和深圳科技工业园总公司电脑实验室联合开发成功的“全汉字编码输入与字形输出技术”，今天在此间通过中国科学院主持的技术鉴定。
    这项技术把全部汉字的字形分解成108个基本字形结构，归类安排在24个英文字母键上，同时规定一组简明易学的组码规则，可以对600万个字形编码，其中6万个见诸中文字典。这种方案特别适用于古籍整理研究、图书情报、户籍管理等别的方法很难完成的大型数据处理领域。
