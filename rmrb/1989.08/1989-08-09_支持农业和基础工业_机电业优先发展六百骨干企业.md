Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 9th.

A senior official from the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics said this afternoon that to further adjust the industrial structure and revitalize large and medium-sized key enterprises, the ministry has recently decided to prioritize the development of 600 key enterprises in the machinery and electronics sector. This is an important measure they have taken to strengthen macro-control and support the development of agriculture and basic industries.

According to the official, these 600 key enterprises were selected from several hundred enterprises in the industry after classification and repeated screening, based on the State Council's recent decision on the key points of current industrial policy.

The official said that these 600 key enterprises in the machinery and electronics sector are responsible for providing equipment for energy, transportation, raw materials, and other basic industries and agriculture. They are also a significant source of national fiscal revenue. He pointed out that revitalizing these enterprises, which are urgently needed for national development and are particularly important, is of great significance in increasing fiscal revenue, enhancing national strength, and stabilizing the economy. He said that this list will also serve as an important reference for the financial sector in implementing credit structure adjustments and preferential policies during the period of tightening.

The Ministry of Machinery and Electronics official said that this list includes a group of old enterprises that directly serve national key construction projects and new enterprises that have developed with state support in recent years. It also includes advanced enterprises such as the First Heavy Machinery Plant, the Second Heavy Machinery Plant, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Second Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Dongfang Power Station Equipment Company, Shenyang Cable Factory, Shaanxi Cathode Ray Tube Factory, Wuxi Microelectronics United Company, and Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, which enjoy a good reputation internationally.

He pointed out that many of these 600 key enterprises are currently facing difficulties in fund turnover due to reasons such as rising raw material prices and arrears in "triangular debts." Therefore, active measures must be taken to ensure their normal production and operations. He expressed that the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics has, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council leaders, worked with the banking sector to study solutions to help these enterprises overcome their difficulties.

    支持农业和基础工业
    机电业优先发展六百骨干企业
    本报北京8月9日讯　机械电子工业部负责人今天下午在这里发表谈话说：为进一步调整产业结构、搞活大中型骨干企业，该部最近确定，对机电行业的600家骨干企业在产业发展序列中实行优先发展的政策。这是他们为加强宏观调控、支持农业和基础工业发展而采取的一项重要措施。
    据介绍，这600家骨干企业是机电部根据国务院不久前作出的《关于当前产业政策要点的决定》，对全行业的几百家企业进行分类排队并经过反复筛选后确定的。
    这位负责人说，机械电子行业的这600家骨干企业担负着为能源、交通、原材料等基础工业和农业提供装备的重要任务，也是国家财政收入的重要来源。他指出，搞活这些国家急需发展的和特别重要的企业，对于增加财政收入、增强国力和稳定经济具有不可替代的重要意义。他说，这个名单确定后，对金融部门在紧缩中实施信贷结构调整和倾斜政策也有重要的参考价值。
    机电部负责人说，这个名单包括直接为国家重点建设服务的一批老企业和近年来在国家扶持下发展起来的新兴企业，也有像第一重型机器厂、第二重型机器厂、第一汽车制造厂、第二汽车制造厂、东方电站设备成套公司、沈阳电缆厂、陕西显像管总厂、无锡微电子联合公司、太原重机厂等一批在国际上享有声誉的先进企业。
    他指出，这600家骨干企业目前有相当一部分因原材料涨价、“三角债”拖欠等原因，不同程度地出现了资金周转困难。为此，要采取积极措施，保证它们生产经营的正常进行。他表示，机械电子部已按照国务院领导同志的指示，会同银行部门抓紧研究办法，帮助这些企业解决困难。
