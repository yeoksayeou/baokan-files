The signing ceremony for the investment agreement of the first phase of the Shanghai Cold-Rolled Thin Plate project, a joint venture between Chinese and foreign partners, was held in Shanghai on July 28. The Shanghai Yichang Thin Plate Co., Ltd., jointly established by the four investing parties, was also officially announced at the same time.

Currently, there is a significant gap between the supply and demand for cold-rolled steel plates in China, requiring a large amount of foreign exchange for imports each year. To quickly alleviate this contradiction, the Shanghai First Iron and Steel Plant, Shanghai Real Estate Company, China Resources Development Investment Company, and Shanghai Pacific Joint-Stock Company decided to jointly invest in the construction of the Shanghai Cold-Rolled Thin Plate project. After completion, this project will have an annual production capacity of 300,000 tons of cold-rolled thin plates, with 80% of the total production being the extremely scarce 0.2–0.5MM thin plates. Mayor Zhu Rongji of Shanghai and others attended the signing ceremony.

The first national drug exchange fair was held in Meihekou City.

The People's Daily, Changchun, August 5—The Jilin Province Longbai Mountain Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Materials Group Company, composed of 37 agricultural, industrial, commercial, and pharmaceutical production and sales enterprises from three cities and one prefecture in Jilin, Tonghua, Hunjiang, and Yanbian, began holding the first national drug exchange fair in Meihekou City today.
