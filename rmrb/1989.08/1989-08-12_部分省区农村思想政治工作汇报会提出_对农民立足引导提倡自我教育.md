We must also focus on educating the current stage of the Party's various policies in rural areas. At the same time, we must raise the banner of patriotism, emphasize national conditions education, and education on patriotism, socialism, self-reliance, and hard work. Through education, we can further make the broad masses of farmers understand why we must adhere to the socialist road and why we must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party. We should actively guide farmers to summarize experiences, educate themselves, and improve themselves, firmly believe in the Party's leadership, resolutely walk the socialist road, and inspire their enthusiasm and creativity for building a socialist modern new countryside.
