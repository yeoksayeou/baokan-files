Sichuan, abbreviated as "Shu," has a name related to silkworms. The name "Shu" is derived from the silkworm. During the Han and Five Dynasties periods, Chengdu was famous for its brocade, hence the name "Brocade City."

Although Sichuan silk was already renowned in the Tang Dynasty for its superior quality, earning it the title of "Tianbao's finest treasure," and was exported to Europe and Asia, being treasured by various countries, its true development began after the establishment of New China, particularly in the past decade. In 1979, Sichuan's cocoon production reached 1.1 million piculs, a tenfold increase from the early days of liberation, making it the highest in the country. During the decade of reform, the Sichuan Provincial Committee proposed the development policy for Sichuan silk: adjusting the structure, improving quality, increasing varieties, and expanding the market; using reform to oversee the entire situation, and taking a path that combines the advantages of raw materials and structural adjustments. Over the past decade, Sichuan silk has flourished in the reform, regaining its former glory, and its position and reputation in domestic and international markets have significantly improved. The Sichuan silk industry has undergone a tremendous transformation:

- The foundation of sericulture has been significantly strengthened, and the advantage of raw materials has become more pronounced. In 1988, the province's cocoon production reached 2.5 million piculs, accounting for 1/3 of the national and 1/5 of the world's production, a 22-fold increase from 1949.

- A relatively complete silk processing system has been formed, and structural adjustments have made significant progress. The capacity for reeling silk has more than doubled compared to ten years ago, and the production of raw silk has increased by 55 times compared to 1949, while silk fabrics have increased by 1600 times. Thirty true silk knitting and silk garment processing enterprises have been developed, filling some gaps. Last year, the total output value of the silk industry exceeded 1.07 billion yuan, which is 2.5 times and 220 times that of ten years ago and 1949, respectively.

- The ability to earn foreign exchange through exports has greatly increased, with considerable potential for expanding exports. Sichuan silk began self-operated exports in 1985 and is now sold in 26 countries and regions, with more than 150 major customers. Last year, it earned 228 million US dollars through exports, and this year it is expected to reach 250 million US dollars. Silk has become one of the pillar products of Sichuan's foreign trade exports.

    巴蜀丝绸之路
    四川简称“蜀”。蚕似蜀。“蜀”之得名，与蚕有关。汉及五代时，成都因织锦闻名，故称“锦城”。
    尽管四川丝绸早在唐代就已“胜苏杭品质之优，享天宝物华之誉”，称誉神州，远销欧亚，被各国视为珍宝；但其真正的长足发展，还是新中国建立以后，尤其是在最近的10年间。1979年，四川蚕茧产量达110万担，比解放初期增长了10倍，居全国首位。10年改革中，四川省委提出四川丝绸的发展方针：调整结构，提高质量，增加品种，开拓市场；以改革总揽全局，走发挥原料优势和调整结构相结合的路子。10年来，四川丝绸在改革中蓬勃发展，重放异彩，在国内外的地位和声誉显著提高。四川丝绸业发生了巨变：
    ——桑茧生产这一丝绸行业的基础明显加强，原料优势更为显著。1988年，全省蚕茧产量达250万担，分别占全国和全世界产量的1／3和1／5，比1949年增长22倍。
    ——较完整的丝绸加工体系形成，调整结构取得重大进展。缫丝能力比10年前增加2倍多，生丝产量则比1949年增长55倍，丝织品增长1600倍。真丝针织、丝绸服装加工企业发展了30家，填补了一些空白。去年丝绸业总产值逾10.7亿元，分别是10年前和1949年的2.5倍和220倍。
    ——出口创汇能力大增，具有相当大的扩大出口潜力。四川丝绸自营出口从1985年始，目前已行销26个国家、地区，基本客户逾150家。去年出口创汇2.28亿美元，今年可达2.5亿美元。丝绸已是四川外贸出口产品的支柱之一。
