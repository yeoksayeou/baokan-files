A horrifying counter-revolutionary riot has been largely suppressed. Now, people should engage in sober reflection on some issues.

For a period of time, many people have harbored an anti-historical and anti-scientific misconception, believing that university students are the pride of the times, the future and hope of the nation. Therefore, any time university students take to the streets to protest and demonstrate, it is naturally justified and patriotic, and should be unconditionally supported and backed. This misconception has been particularly prominent among some Beijing residents this year. However, it is clear that with this mindset, it is difficult to distinguish right from wrong, and one unconsciously becomes a tool for those who create turmoil and riots. Otherwise, the social life of the capital would not have been so severely disrupted, and other cities in the country would not have been influenced to the extent that they followed suit.

Are student movements naturally correct and should they be supported? Not necessarily! Historically, on February 22, 1946, in Chongqing, there was a large-scale protest by middle and high school students known as the "2.22" anti-Soviet, anti-Communist demonstration. They even smashed the offices of the Xinhua Daily. This was after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when the reactionary Kuomintang, with the support of the United States, was eager to create public opinion for launching a civil war. They used a minor incident on the Sino-Soviet border, through their vast network of spies, to deceive, incite, and organize middle and high school students to participate. Later, the students realized they had been tricked.

There is also the well-known "Cultural Revolution" of the 1960s, where millions of "Red Guards" rose up in rebellion. Under the manipulation and command of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques, they turned the entire country upside down, bringing the national economy to the brink of collapse and plunging the people into disaster. These two so-called "student movements" have now been condemned by history. Unfortunately, some university students in the 1980s, nurtured by the Party and the people, were incited by a few counter-revolutionaries to overthrow the Party and government of the people. How heartbreaking!

Anyone with a bit of common sense can see that from the beginning of this turmoil to the riot, there is a shocking and strange situation: that is, malicious slander and defamation of the Party and government are rampant, and these rumors mainly come from "Voice of America." "Voice of America" has long been infamous, being a base for manufacturing rumors to overthrow other countries. Our students openly disseminated the rumors created by "Voice of America," using them as ammunition to attack the Party and government. This clearly shows two points: first, some who shout slogans of patriotism while creating turmoil and riots have actually taken foreign, especially American, reactionary forces as their backers. Their true purpose is not to fight corruption and official malfeasance, but to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert the socialist republic. Second, some who shout slogans of patriotism are actually a group of very weak individuals who rely on spreading rumors to attack the government, and their rumors are one by one exposed by facts.

Those with a bit of historical knowledge know that from the "May Fourth Movement" to the "December 9th Movement" to the eve of liberation, all truly patriotic and progressive student movements had two important contents: opposing the traitorous reactionary government internally and opposing imperialist aggression externally. This is the fine tradition of China's truly patriotic student movements. The nature of such student movements determines that they will not rely on foreign reactionary forces and will not use the means of manufacturing and spreading rumors, because they hold the truth, and the truth is the most powerful weapon. Some people in this student movement have raised the banner of inheriting the spirit of the "May Fourth Movement," but in reality, it is a great insult to the spirit of the "May Fourth Movement."

### 学生运动是天然合理的吗？——澄清一种颇为流行的糊涂观念

    学生运动是天然合理的吗？
    ——澄清一种颇为流行的糊涂观念
    钟知
    一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱已经基本平息。现在人们应当对一些问题进行清醒的反思了。
    一段时间以来，许多人脑子里存在一种反历史反科学的胡涂观念，认为大学生是时代的骄子、国家的未来和希望，因此凡是大学生上街游行示威，就是天然合理和爱国的行动，就应当无条件支持和声援。这种糊涂观念今年在北京的一些市民中表现得特别突出。殊不知事实证明，有了这种观念，就不易分辨是非，就不自觉地为那些制造动乱和暴乱的人所利用，不然首都的社会生活不会遭受如此严重的破坏，国内其它一些城市也不会受首都的影响而跟着闹得那么厉害。
    “学生运动”是否天然正确应当声援呢？不见得！从历史上看，1946年2月22日，在重庆就发生过一次大中学生的“2·22”反苏反共游行示威，还砸了新华日报报馆。那是抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动派在美国支持下，迫不及待要为发动内战制造舆论，利用中苏边境一件小事，通过其庞大的特务组织蒙骗煽动和组织大中学生搞起来的。事后学生们才明白自己受骗上当了。
    再有就是今天的中老年人熟知的十年“文化大革命”，成百万的“红卫兵”起来造反，在林彪、江青两个反革命集团的利用操纵指挥下，把整个中国“造”翻了天，国民经济濒于崩溃，人民陷入灾难。上述两次所谓的“学生运动”如今不都已被钉上了历史的耻辱柱吗？不幸的是，八十年代受到党和人民哺育的一些大学生，竟然在极少数反革命分子煽动下，要打倒人民自己的党和政府，这是多么令人痛心的事！
    凡是稍有头脑的人，都可以发现从这次动乱到暴乱有一个惊人而奇怪的情况，那就是恶毒中伤诽谤党和政府的谣言满天飞，而这些谣言又主要来源于“美国之音”。“美国之音”者，几十年来早已臭名昭著，乃专门为了颠覆别国而制造谣言的大本营也。我们的大学生们却公然把“美国之音”制造的谣言到处传抄张贴散布，以此作为炮弹来攻击党和政府。这就清楚地表明两点：一、某些高喊爱国口号而搞学潮、动乱的人原来已经把外国的特别是美国的反动势力作为后台靠山，他们的真正目的并不是什么反腐化反官倒，而是要推翻共产党的领导和颠覆社会主义人民共和国。二、某些高喊爱国口号的人原来是一伙十分虚弱的只有依靠造谣来攻击政府的卑鄙之徒，而他们制造的谣言又一个个地被事实所戳穿。
    多少有一点历史知识的人都知道，从“五四”到“一二·九”到解放前夕的所有真正爱国的进步的学生运动，都具有两个重要内容，即对内反对卖国的反动政府，对外反对帝国主义的侵略。这是中国真正的爱国学生运动的优良传统。这样的学生运动的性质决定了它决不会去依靠外国反动势力，决不会采用制造传播谣言的手段，因为他们手中有真理，真理才是最强大的武器。这次学潮中的某些人曾经打出继承“五四”精神的旗号，实际上是对“五四”精神的莫大污辱。
