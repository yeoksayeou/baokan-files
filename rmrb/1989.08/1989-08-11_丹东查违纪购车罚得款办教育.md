Dandong recently took action against 61 vehicles purchased in violation of regulations, seizing them and imposing fines on the purchasing units. All the funds collected were allocated to education.

In addition to seizing these vehicles, the municipal government also fined the units that purchased them illegally a total of 470,000 yuan. The seized vehicles and the fines, totaling 3,220,000 yuan, were all used to supplement the shortage of educational funds and were not allowed to be used for other purposes. For the seized vehicles, the municipal government decided to allocate and sell them to units that meet the vehicle allocation regulations, have funding sources, and do not require financial allocations.

    据新华社沈阳八月十一日电（通讯员王黎明）辽宁省丹东市最近对查出违纪购买的六十一台车辆作出没收并对购车单位实行罚款的处理。所收款项全部用于办教育。
    市政府除全部没收这些车辆外，还按照有关规定对违纪购车单位罚款四十七万元，将没收车辆折价款和罚款共三百二十二万元全部用于补充教育经费的不足，不准挪做他用。对没收的车辆，市政府决定分配售给符合配车规定，有资金来源，不需财政拨款的单位。
