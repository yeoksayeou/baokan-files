On April 3, this newspaper published a report titled "A Few Things About Party Secretary Fang Zhao Xiang" on the front page, briefly introducing the diligent and clean governance practices of Fang Zhao Xiang, the 46-year-old Party Secretary of Anqing City. Afterwards, many people asked me: How does he manage to maintain integrity and clean governance? With this question in mind, I interviewed him again.

Fang Zhao Xiang shared his thoughts.

Middle-aged and young cadres have taken up leadership positions under specific historical conditions. They bear the historical mission of carrying on the legacy and revitalizing China. For them, the biggest challenge in achieving success lies in overcoming their own limitations and blind spots. Only by recognizing themselves can they gain the trust of others.

From the experiences of the past few years, we have encountered the following challenges:

First, the degeneration of a pure heart. Before being selected, the majority of middle-aged and young cadres were outstanding individuals among the masses. They were good because they had a pure heart, placing their personal gains and losses in the appropriate social context, maintaining integrity, and serving the Party and the country. However, it must be acknowledged that when their social status changes significantly, if they fall into blind spots, they may create conditions for negative outcomes. Facts have shown that such degeneration has already begun: some believe that once they become officials, they must maintain a certain image and face. They must ride in cars, even for a few hundred meters, and must be driven, with good cars and new models, even causing unpleasant incidents over car disputes. When speaking, they must have secretaries write the speeches, and if not, they feel disrespected, making it impossible for leaders to surpass the level of their secretaries, thus losing their advantages.

Second, excessive self-reflection. Everything has its limits. If one cannot grasp the key points of self-reflection, being overly modest can lead to a loss of confidence. Especially in critical moments of emergency and adaptation, if one lacks confidence, this common weakness among middle-aged and young cadres can lead to a loss of self-confidence if superiors do not understand, tolerate, or even look down upon them.

Third, an overemphasis on "immediate success." Middle-aged and young cadres are naturally good at getting things done, tackling issues head-on. However, after becoming leaders, they often retain this mindset. People often see them rushing from morning to night, not trusting others to handle matters, often taking on tasks that should be handled by their peers or subordinates, affecting others' initiative. As a result, after a year of hard work, their achievements are meager.

If these problems are addressed well, it will be beneficial for the leadership team to consistently uphold "one central task and two fundamental principles," achieving both integrity and diligence. Of course, solving these problems requires social support. Social public opinion should create a good environment for them to recognize themselves. The understanding, help, and support from the people are crucial.

However, solving problems mainly relies on their own efforts. Regardless of how long middle-aged and young cadres have been in politics or how high their positions are, they should not overestimate their cohesion and influence. Therefore, they must maintain integrity; without integrity, they lose the basic condition for being in politics. Second, they must adhere to the principle of equality, always treating subordinates and the general public as equals, genuinely understanding the people's sentiments, and having the people's scale in their hearts to weigh out any personal desires. Third, they must keep a cool head. When faced with societal praise, if they do not remain calm, they may drift away from the people.

Middle-aged and young cadres must also focus on breaking static equilibrium. The improvement of a cadre's qualities is not a one-time process, and success does not mean stagnation. The objective world is constantly changing, and only by diligently studying political, economic, and scientific knowledge, being good at acquiring and utilizing information, and comprehensively managing, can they continuously improve their ideological and leadership levels, and keep moving forward.

Fang Zhao Xiang's final conclusion is: The fundamental way for middle-aged and young leaders to consistently achieve both diligence and integrity is to be good at recognizing themselves.

    中青年领导干部如何做到既勤政又廉政？中共安庆市委书记方兆祥认为——
    要善于认识自己
    本报记者　张振国
    今年4月3日，本报在一版发表了《市委书记方兆祥二三事》的通讯，简介了46岁的安庆市委书记勤政和廉政的事迹。事后，有很多人问我：他为何能坚持廉洁奉公？带着这个问题，我又访问了他。
    方兆祥掏出了心里话。
    中青年干部是在特定的历史条件下走上领导岗位的。他们肩负着承前启后、振兴中华的历史使命。对于他们来说，要想取得成功，最难克服的困难在于自身的局限性和盲目性。唯有认识自己，才能赢得其他。
    从近几年的实践看，我们中青年干部在以下几个问题上遇到了挑战：
    一是质朴心态的蜕化。中青年干部在入选之前，绝大多数都是群众中的优秀分子。他们好就好在有一种质朴的心态，把自己的荣辱得失放在社会的恰当位置上，廉洁奉公，为党为国。但也毋庸讳言，当社会地位发生明显变化时，如果陷入盲目性，那就可能为走向反面创造条件。事实证明，这种蜕化的苗头已经出现：有的以为当了官，就得讲排场，要面子。出门就要坐车，几百米的路程也要接送，车况要好，型号要新，甚至发生争车之类不愉快的事。讲话，也要秘书写稿，不写就认为瞧他不起，这样领导就无法超过秘书水平，把好端端的优势弄得荡然无存。
    二是自省行为的过度。凡事都有个度。如果把握不住自省的关节点，过于自谦，就会丧失自信。特别是在应急、应变的紧要关头，心理发怵，信心不足，对于中青年干部的这种常见弱点，如果上级不理解，不宽容，乃至瞧不起，那就可能使他们丧失自信。
    三是过于崇尚“直接成功”。中青年干部本来都是一把干事的好手，遇事一抓到底。可是他们当了领导干部之后，依然故我。人们常常看见他们从早到晚东奔西忙，凡事自己不介入，就不放心，往往揽了同级的事，也越了下级的权，影响了别人的积极性。结果忙了一年，政绩寥寥。
    如果这些问题解决得好，就有利于领导班子始终坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”，既廉政，又勤政。当然，解决问题离不开社会的力量。社会舆论应为他们认识自己创造一个良好的环境。人们的理解、帮助和支持太重要了。
    但是，解决问题主要依靠自身的力量。中青年干部不论从政时间有多长，职位有多高，都不能过高地估计自己的凝聚力和影响力。为此，一要做到廉洁，不廉洁就失去了从政的基本条件。二要坚持平等的法则，时时处处与下级干部和一般群众平起平坐，实打实地体察民情，心里有了群众这杆秤，什么样的私心都可称得出。三要头脑冷静。当社会上赞誉之声鹊起时，若不冷静，就可能脱离群众。
    中青年干部还要注重打破静态平衡。一个干部素质的提高，不是一次完成的，成功之后也不可能一成不变。客观世界不停地发生变化，只有勤奋学习政治、经济、科学技术知识，善于掌握信息，运用信息，综合管理，不断提高思想水平和领导水平，才能不断前进。
    方兆祥最后的结论是：中青年领导干部要始终做到既勤政又廉政，根本途径就是要善于认识自己。
