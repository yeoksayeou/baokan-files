Industrial enterprises face challenges such as rising raw material prices and capital shortages. In the face of numerous adverse factors, there are two distinctly different attitudes: one is to complain endlessly, reaching out to higher authorities and consumers; the other is to look inward, adjusting the enterprise's product structure and tapping into potential.

Those who adopt the first attitude try every means to request that higher authorities reduce profit contract targets, apply for tax exemptions, or use the excuse of "rising water lifting the boat" to apply for price increases. Some actually succeed, appearing to have gained an advantage on the surface. But such enterprises have no internal mechanism changes, lack the ability to withstand difficulties, and if they encounter other adverse factors in the future, they will continue to rely on reaching out to higher authorities or raising product prices to get by. Their path will become narrower and narrower, ultimately leading to a dead end and defeat in competition.

The second attitude focuses on self-improvement within the enterprise, enhancing its ability to withstand difficulties, which is the fundamental way out. Zhoukou MSG Factory is a good example. When facing rising raw material prices and other adverse factors, it does not reach out to higher authorities but instead relies on its own efforts to carry out technological transformations, strengthen internal management, and improve production and efficiency. Its output has increased significantly year by year, and its quality has won gold medals at both the National Food Expo and the 12th World Food Expo. Prices remain stable. Due to its high quality and low price, the product is in high demand, and the market coverage rate continues to expand. The factory's vitality is also becoming more robust, digesting 11.3 million yuan in increased expenditure over three years, with output and tax revenue increasing at an average annual rate of 54% and 88%, respectively.

This year, the national refrigerator market is basically saturated, sales are sluggish, and some models are stagnant and accumulating inventory. However, Beijing Snowflake brand refrigerators are still selling well. This is the result of Snowflake Electrical Appliance Company's efforts to enhance the enterprise's digestive capacity, maintain product quality as a famous brand, and keep prices lower than similar products, thereby establishing a good reputation among users.

The examples of Zhoukou MSG Factory and Beijing Snowflake Electrical Appliance Company provide inspiration. They show that an enterprise's ability to withstand difficulties is closely linked to its vitality. If most enterprises, especially large and medium-sized enterprises with strong technical strength and great potential in management, can mobilize the broad masses of workers to improve the enterprise's internal production conditions, there will be a turn for the better. Enterprises with the ability to withstand difficulties generally have advantages in quality and price and will inevitably eliminate those with low technical levels, high consumption, and reliance on price increases to get by in the competition. This will free up some raw materials, capital, and electricity, and from a macro perspective, it will be beneficial for adjusting the product structure and improving social benefits.

### 消化力和生命力

    消化力和生命力
    李言
    工业企业遇到原材料涨价、资金短缺等困难和挑战，在诸多不利因素面前，有两种截然不同的态度：一种是叫苦不迭，向上伸手，向消费者伸手；一种是眼睛向内，调整企业的产品结构，深挖潜力。
    持第一种态度的，千方百计地请求上级主管部门核减利润承包指标，申请减免税收，或者以“水涨船高”为理由，申请产品随“船”涨价。会哭的孩子多吃奶，有的也真正得手，表面上看起来沾了便宜。但这样的企业内部机制没有什么变化，缺乏承受能力，今后如果再遇到其它客观不利因素，继续靠向上伸手或调高产品价格度日，路子越走越窄，最后只能走投无路，在竞争中败北。
    后一种态度在企业自身改造上下功夫，增强自身的承受能力，这是根本的出路。周口味精厂就是这样，在遇到原材料涨价等客观不利因素时，不向上伸手，自力更生进行技术改造，加强内部管理，搞好双增双节，产量年年大幅度增长，质量先后获全国食品博览会和十二届世界食品博览会金奖，价格稳定不涨。由于质优价廉，产品供不应求，市场覆盖率不断扩大，工厂的生命力也日益旺盛，3年间消化了1130万元增支因素，产值和利税平均每年以54％和88％的速度递增。
    今年全国电冰箱市场基本饱和，销售疲软，有些品种滞销积压，而北京雪花牌电冰箱却畅销不衰。这也是雪花电器公司努力增强企业的消化能力，产品质量保持名牌优质，价格却低于同类产品，在用户中树立信誉的结果。
    周口味精厂和北京雪花电器公司的事例给人以启示。它说明企业的承受力与生命力紧紧连接在一起。如果多数企业，特别是技术实力雄厚、管理方面潜力很大的大中型企业，都能把广大职工发动起来，努力改善企业内部的生产条件，那就会“柳暗花明又一村”的。凡有承受能力的企业，在质量、价格上一般都具有优势，在竞争中必然要淘汰那些技术水平低、消耗多、靠涨价过日子的工厂，这就可以腾出一部分原材料、资金和电力，从宏观上看，对调整产品结构，提高社会效益也大有好处。
