The 15th World University Games is nearing its end. About two-thirds of the athletes have already left, and the joyful atmosphere in the Weidau Sports Park has faded. The practice fields are empty, the temporary commercial street has few visitors, and the news center's telecommunication service girls are leisurely playing chess to pass the time.

Today, the final event of the fencing competition—the men's épée team event—was held. The Italian team defeated the Cuban team 9-7 to win the championship. The Chinese team, after losing to France and the Soviet Union, was eliminated from the top 8. With this, all 10 fencing events of this tournament have concluded. Italian athletes performed the best, winning 10 medals, including four golds. Most of the medals were won by European athletes from the homeland of fencing. Among Asian countries, only Chinese girls won two bronze medals.

After 68 matches, the men's basketball tournament saw the U.S. team emerge victorious in all their games. Tonight, they defeated the Soviet Union 88-80 to win the championship. In the afternoon, the Chinese team defeated Poland 86-78 in the placement match, securing the 13th position.

On the track and field, although six finals were held today, three events saw the tournament records broken by 14 athletes. In the women's 5-kilometer race walk, six Italian athletes, including Salvadore, all surpassed the tournament record of 21 minutes and 51 seconds. Romanian athlete V. Ghican completed the women's 10,000-meter race in 31 minutes and 46.43 seconds. The 18-year-old Japanese girl Ishizaka Masami, standing at 1.51 meters and weighing only 35 kilograms, finished just 29.81 seconds behind the taller and heavier Ghican. However, the audience's applause for Masami was much louder, and photographers took many more pictures of her. Five other athletes also broke the women's 10,000-meter tournament record. The women's heptathlon record was broken today by Soviet athlete Nikitina with a total score of 6847 points. Chinese athlete Wu Pin finished 12th in the heptathlon with a total score of 5538. Additionally, the gold medals for the men's 800 meters, men's discus throw, and men's triple jump were won by athletes from Finland, the U.S., and the Soviet Union, respectively.

The rowing, fencing, and men's basketball competitions of this tournament have all concluded by tonight.

    世界大学生运动会接近尾声
    美国男篮获冠军
    新华社杜伊斯堡8月29日电　（记者王训生）第15届世界大学生运动会接近尾声，约2／3的运动员已陆续离开这里，韦道体育公园充盈的欢乐气氛随之淡落下来，练习场上空无一人，临时组成的商业街人流稀少，新闻中心的电讯服务小姐在悠然弈棋消磨时光。
    今天，击剑进行了最后一个项目——男子重剑团体赛，意大利选手以9∶7战胜古巴队获得冠军，中国队在接连负于法国、苏联队后，被排出前8名。至此本届运动会击剑10个项目的比赛全部结束，意大利选手成绩最好获得10枚奖牌，其中有四项冠军。大多数的奖牌被击剑运动故乡的欧洲选手所得。亚洲唯有中国姑娘夺取其中的两枚铜牌。
    男子篮球经过68场的较量，还是美国队技高一筹连战皆捷，最后在今晚以88∶80战胜苏联队后获得冠军。中国队今天下午在名次赛中以86∶78战胜波兰队，取得第13位的名次。
    田径场上今天虽然进行了6项决赛，却有3个项目的大会纪录被14人刷新。在女子5公里竞走比赛中，意大利选手萨尔瓦多尔等6人的成绩，均超过了大会21分51秒的成绩。罗马尼亚运动员维·吉坎仅用31分46秒43的时间跑完了女子万米的赛程。身高1米51，体重仅35公斤的日本18岁姑娘石坂雅美仅比身高马大的吉坎多用了29秒81的时间，但观众给她的掌声远比给吉坎的响亮，摄影师拍摄她的镜头也多得多。超女子万米大会纪录的还有5人。女子7项全能的大会纪录，今天被苏联的尼基季娜以总分6847分所打破。中国运动员吴频在7项全能比赛中名列第12位，总分只有5538。另外，今天决出的男子800米、男子铁饼和三级跳远的金牌，分别归于芬兰、美国和苏联的运动员之手。
    本届运动会所设的赛艇、击剑、男子篮球三项的比赛到今晚先后结束。
