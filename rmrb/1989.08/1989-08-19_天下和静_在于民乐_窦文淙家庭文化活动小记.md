Pushing open the door, both the large and small rooms were filled with people. Some played instruments, some sang, and some performed, creating a lively atmosphere.

This was retired teacher Dou Wencong hosting his weekly "Weekend Family Cultural Evening." The "main venue" was set up in the 14-square-meter large room, and the "sub-venue" was in the 10-square-meter small room. Inside and outside, everyone's face was lit up with smiles.

"I'll go, the next act is mine." Perhaps there were guests in the house, and the children were a bit shy. The 74-year-old Dou Wencong stood in the center of the "stage." "I'll perform a segment of 'Zhan Ma Su.' ... Oh no, I didn't bring my erhu."—usually, he played and sang by himself.

"It's okay, I have a 'meat string.'" His second son pointed to his throat and began to "play" the introduction.

After singing a segment of Beijing opera, his elderly wife with silver hair, lying on the bed and fanning herself, said, "Not bad, but think about the old days..."

The room erupted in laughter like a wave.

Next, his second son sang a segment of the high tenor song "I Guard the Bridge for My Country"; his grandson sang a segment from the TV drama "The Legend of the Wooden Fish" and another from the theme song of "Wanquan Wind and Clouds." The family softly clapped and sang along...

Dou Wencong's eldest daughter, who works as the director of Shenzhuangzi Street Health Clinic, introduced, "Our family has 25 members. Besides our parents, there are six smaller families. Every Saturday, everyone voluntarily gathers here to hold a family cultural evening. The reason is simple: life is better now, we are happy, and we want to sing and dance."

...The cultural evening became more and more lively. There were performances of Beijing drum singing, Hebei bangzi opera, and male-female duets. The granddaughter, not yet five years old, sang a segment of "Asking the Way." Suddenly, the format changed. The children in middle school and university performed an English dialogue, asking quickly and answering swiftly, making the room buzz with excitement.

Family cultural life has transformed the family. Out of the six smaller families, three have been recognized as municipal and district-level "Five-Good Families."

Mass cultural activities in Tianjin have blossomed everywhere, with family culture being a prominent feature. Now, Tianjin often sees family music competitions, family opera competitions, family dance competitions, family variety show competitions, and family cultural series competitions. Early this year, the Ministry of Culture held a mass cultural activities conference in Tianjin, commending and recommending Tianjin's family cultural activities. Mayor Li Ruihuan happily said: "Harmony in the world lies in the people's joy. This is called being rich and thinking of culture, being happy and thinking of culture."

    天下和静  在于民乐
    ——窦文淙家庭文化活动小记
    推开房门，大屋小屋全是人。有的弹，有的唱，有的表演，好不热闹。
    这是退休老教师窦文淙在举行每周一次的“周末家庭文艺晚会”。“主会场”设在14平方米的大屋，“分会场”设在十平方米的小屋。里里外外，每个人的脸上都挂着笑。
    “我来，下一个节目归我。”大概屋内来了客人，孩子们有些扭捏。74岁的窦文淙站到了“台”中央。“我来一段《斩马谡》。……坏了，没带京胡。”——平时他自拉自唱。
    “不要紧，我有‘肉弦’。”二儿子指了一下嗓子，开始“拉”过门。
    一段京剧唱下来，满头银发的老伴儿在床上摇着蒲扇说：“不怎么样，想当年……”
    屋子里响起潮水般的笑声。
    接着，二儿子唱一段男高音《我为祖国守大桥》；外孙唱一段电视剧《木鱼石的传说》插曲，又唱一段电视剧《万泉风云》主题歌，一家人轻声击节伴唱……
    在沈庄子街卫生院当院长的大女儿窦天珠介绍说：我们家共有25口人，除了父母，还有六个小家庭。每到了周六，大家主动聚到这里举办家庭文艺晚会。其实，道理很简单：现在生活好了，心里高兴，就想唱，就想跳。
    ……文艺晚会越开越热闹。有唱京韵大鼓的，有唱河北梆子的，还有男女声合唱的，不到五岁的小孙女唱一段《敢问路在何方》。一会儿，变了形式。上中学、大学的孩子们来一段英语对话，问得急、答得快，屋子里像开了锅。
    家庭文化生活使家庭变了样。六个小家庭中有三个被评为市、区级“五好家庭”。
    群众性的文化活动在天津已经遍地开花，家庭文化是其中一个突出特色。现在，津城不时会出现一些家庭音乐大赛、家庭戏曲大赛、家庭舞蹈大赛、家庭曲艺大赛、家庭文化系列大赛。今年初，文化部曾在天津召开群众文化活动会议，表扬并推荐了天津的家庭文化活动。李瑞环市长则高兴地说：天下和静，在于民乐。这叫做富而思文，乐而思文。
