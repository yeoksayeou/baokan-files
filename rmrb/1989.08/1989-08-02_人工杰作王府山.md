	Man-Made Masterpiece: Wangfu Mountain
	Yang Feng

	Most famous mountains in the world are natural formations created by the earth, but Wangfu Mountain in the western part of Beiguan Street, Nanyang City, Henan Province, is a man-made mountain constructed from various types of stones. According to historical records, the 23rd son of the Ming Dynasty's founding emperor, Zhu Gan, was enfeoffed as the Prince of Tang in the 24th year of the Hongwu reign. In May 12th of the 6th year of the Yongle reign, he took up residence in Nanyang. This mountain was part of the prince's residence, hence the name Wangfu Mountain.

	The stones used to build Wangfu Mountain were mostly sourced from Taihu Lake, with the largest weighing over 3,000 jin. These stones were transported to Nanyang using a relay method. The garden architects of that time used Song and Yuan dynasty landscape paintings as their blueprint and innovated a unique style of rockery art. Over the course of two years, they constructed a mountain in the style of a pagoda with five levels, decreasing in size from bottom to top, forming a conical shape. The mountain is 18 meters high, with a base circumference of 21 meters, covering an area of 346 square meters. At the foot of the mountain, there is a temple, and the mountain gate bears the inscription "Chao Tian Palace." Scattered throughout the mountain are pavilions, stone caves, and inscriptions. At the peak, there is a hexagonal pavilion. Inside the mountain, there are winding paths, stone caves of various shapes, and statues of Buddhas, each with its own unique expression. There is also a secret passage leading to a distant part of the garden. Entering the mountain, one feels as if in a stalactite cave, ascending the spiral stairs to the top, one feels as if in a painted screen; looking out, the white river flows like a ribbon, and a solitary peak shines like a green gem under the blue sky. Looking back at the city, one sees a harmonious blend of green trees and red tiles, vibrant and heart-stirring.

	Wangfu Mountain has stood for over 580 years, surviving numerous earthquakes during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and remains steadfast. It showcases the superb architectural skills of ancient laborers and is a marvel in garden architecture.

    人工杰作王府山
    杨锋
    大凡天下名山，多系天地造化形成，而河南省南阳市北关大街西的王府山，则是用各种异石堆砌的一座假山。据有关资料记载，明太祖第二十三子朱柽，于洪武二十四年封为唐定王，永乐六年五月十二日就藩南阳。此山因系王府建筑一部分，故名王府山。
    修建王府山所用之山石，大都来自太湖，最大者3000余斤，用接力的方法辗转运到南阳。当时的园林建筑大师以宋元以来山水画为蓝本，又独创出别具一格的叠山艺术。历时两年，建成了一座仿楼阁式转塔结构，五级，自下而上依次递减，呈圆锥状。山高18米，底围21米，占地面积346平方米。山麓建有神庙，山门题额“朝天宫”。山间亭台散点，石窟比联，山顶有一六角攒尖的亭台。山内栈道盘岩穿穴，层层阶梯依势螺旋回绕，石窟各异，一尊尊佛像各显神态风韵。里边还有一暗道，通向园林很远的地方。走进假山之内，犹如钟乳石洞，沿台阶盘旋而上，登至山顶，如置身画屏之中；举目远眺，白水如锦带蜿蜒，独峰似一块绿宝石，在蓝天下熠熠闪光。回首市区，只见绿树红瓦融为一体，和谐明快，叫人砰然心动。
    王府山建成至今，历580多年，经明清以来多次地震而不动，巍然屹立，显示出古代劳动人民高超的建筑艺术，堪称园林建筑中一绝。
