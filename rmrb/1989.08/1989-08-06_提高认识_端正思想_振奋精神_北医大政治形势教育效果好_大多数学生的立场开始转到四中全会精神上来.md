Beijing Medical University was the first to start the new semester in Beijing. In the first week of the new semester, the school's Party Committee organized a concentrated political situation education for all students. This activity, centered around the serious study and dissemination of the documents from the Central Committee's Fourth Plenum, linked personal thoughts and actions during the recent turmoil in Beijing, conducted a deep reflection, and aimed to enhance understanding, rectify thoughts, and boost spirits. According to the feedback from the leaders of various colleges and departments, this was the most organized and effective political study activity the school has held in recent years.

The school officially started classes on July 31. Over 3,000 students (including more than 500 graduate students) attended the study sessions, except for a few dozen who were unable to due to difficulties in buying tickets back from their hometowns or special family circumstances. They all wrote reflection papers. From these papers, it can be seen that the students have seriously reflected on the entire process from the student movement to the turmoil and then to the riot in Beijing. The political stance and attitude of the majority of students have begun to align with the spirit of the Party's Fourth Plenum.

A responsible comrade from the school's Party Committee told the reporter that before the study sessions, they were concerned that some students might resist. However, this phenomenon was rare. The reason is that, through the correct guidance of public opinion in recent times, the patience and help of teachers and parents, the students had relatively sufficient mental preparation. The school's Party Committee and the leaders of various colleges and departments had clear attitudes, dared to educate, and dared to demand, ensuring that the spirit of the Party Central Committee's documents was fully and accurately disseminated and studied.

In terms of the study format, they adopted the methods of central meetings for dissemination, small group discussions, and individual heart-to-heart talks. The school leaders, including the president and the Party Committee secretary, all said that individual heart-to-heart talks were the most effective. This time, the school organized 300 teachers who were politically firm and had experience in political and ideological work to go deep into the student body. Each teacher was responsible for 10 students, organizing discussions and having heart-to-heart talks with each student. "Discussions have more official language, while heart-to-heart talks have more genuine words." Heart-to-heart talks helped many students unravel some difficult "knots," dispelled their worries, and boosted their spirits. According to the reporter's understanding, the school leaders, including President Qu Mianyu and Party Committee Secretary Peng Ruicong, all had talks with the students. In particular, the school leaders and teachers were mostly able to link their own actual situations, speak from their own experiences to help students improve their understanding. Many senior professors and middle-aged and young teachers, as well as attending physicians working on the medical frontline, all put down their busy research and work, from morning to night, to do ideological work for the students, which deeply moved the students. Professor Xu Hou'en had just returned from an academic visit to the United States. During his stay in the United States, he was often asked about the situation regarding the turmoil and riot in Beijing. He jokingly said he had already given 107 "defenses." This time, he combined the domestic and international situations to explain the harm and losses caused by the turmoil and riot to the Party, the country, and the modernization drive, and the importance of quelling the riot, which was widely welcomed by the students. The speeches and recordings of some leaders were also welcomed by the students. Some students, due to illness, were hospitalized but had some unresolved questions in their minds. They were discharged early to participate in the study sessions. A few students who missed the study sessions will be organized to make up for this lesson upon their return to school.

According to Vice President and Party Committee Deputy Secretary Xu Tianmin, to connect this period of concentrated study with future ideological and political education and to solve some deep-seated problems in the students' minds from a theoretical perspective, the school has organized efforts to prepare for specialized lectures on the domestic and international background of the turmoil, democracy, freedom, the rule of law, and the reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, using some of the theoretical class time in the future.

The school also took this political situation education as a turning point to strictly enforce school discipline and regulations. It revised the original management methods and regulations regarding student records, dormitories, life, campus management, classroom discipline, extracurricular activities, and posting large slogans, big-character posters, setting up forums, doing business, and small dance parties within the school.

On August 5, the instructors and college leaders began signing off on the qualified reflection papers. A few students whose reflection papers were not qualified will not be registered and must further rectify their understanding before they can be registered.

    提高认识　端正思想　振奋精神
    北医大政治形势教育效果好
    大多数学生的立场开始转到四中全会精神上来
    本报北京8月6日讯　北京医科大学是新学期北京市开学最早的一所大学。开学第一周，学校党委对全体学生进行了一次集中的政治形势教育。这项活动以认真传达学习中央四中全会文件为中心，联系个人在北京前段动乱中的思想言行，进行深刻反思，以提高认识、端正思想、振奋精神为目的。据各学院和系的领导反映，这是该校近年来组织纪律性和效果最好的一次政治学习活动。
    该校7月31日正式开学。全校3000多名学生（包括500多名研究生），除数十人因外地车票难买、家有特殊情况外，都按时参加了学习，并写出了思想小结。从小结看，同学们对前一段北京发生的由学潮到动乱、由动乱到暴乱的全过程进行了认真反思，大多数同学的政治立场和政治态度开始转到党的四中全会精神上来。
    校党委的负责同志告诉记者，学习前他们担心有的同学会“顶牛”，但实际上这种现象很少，其原因是，经过近期来舆论宣传的正确引导，老师和家长们的耐心帮助，同学们对学习有了比较充分的思想准备，校党委和各院系的领导态度鲜明，敢于教育，敢于要求，保证了党中央文件精神全面、准确地传达学习。
    在学习形式上，他们采取了中会传达、小会讨论、个别谈心的方式。校长、党委书记们都说，个别谈心效果最佳。这次全校组织了300名立场坚定、有做政治思想工作经验的老师深入到学生中去，每人负责10名学生，组织大家讨论，一个一个谈心。“讨论会上官话多，个别谈心真话多”，个别谈心使许多同学解开了一些难解的“扣子”，解除了顾虑，振奋了精神。据记者了解，校长曲绵域、党委书记彭瑞聪等领导同志都和学生谈了话。特别是校领导和老师们大都能联系自己的实际，现身说法帮助同学们共同提高认识。一些老教授、中青年教师，在医疗第一线工作的主治医师们，都是放下繁忙的科研和工作，从早到晚做学生的思想工作的，使同学们很受感动。教授徐厚恩刚从美国作学术访问归来，在美国期间，常有人问起有关北京动乱和暴乱的情况，他笑称自己已作了107次“答辩”，这次他又结合国内外情况，给同学们讲解动乱、暴乱对党、对国家、对四化大业造成的危害和损失，讲平息暴乱的重要意义，受到学生的普遍欢迎。一些领导同志的讲话和录音，入情入理，也受到学生的欢迎。有的同学因病住院，可脑子里有些问题纠缠不清，提前出院回校参加了学习。个别耽误了学习的同学，返校后将组织他们补上学习这一课。
    据副校长兼党委副书记徐天民介绍，为了把这一段集中学习和今后的思想政治教育衔接起来，并从理论上解决同学们头脑里一些深层的问题，学校已组织力量做准备，将利用今后部分理论课时间，就动乱的国内外背景，关于民主、自由、法制和苏联东欧的改革等举行专题讲座。
    该校还把这次政治形势教育作为严格校风校纪的转折点，从学籍、宿舍、生活、校园管理和课堂纪律、课外活动以及关于在校内张贴大标语、大小字报、开设讲坛、经商、小舞会等方面对原有的管理办法和规章制度加以修订。
    8月5日，辅导老师和学院领导开始在合格的小结上签字，少数小结不合格的同学，学校不予注册，须进一步端正认识后才可注册。
