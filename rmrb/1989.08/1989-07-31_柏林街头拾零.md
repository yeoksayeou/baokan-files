Late spring and early summer, the reporter, along with the People's Daily delegation, visited the capital of the German Democratic Republic, Berlin. Although the time spent was short, this beautiful and ancient city left me with many unforgettable and pleasant impressions.

	The Timetables on the Stops
	The German people's meticulous and disciplined spirit is world-renowned. Even the public trams and buses in Berlin operate strictly according to the timetable. Each tram and bus stop has a timetable, allowing people to plan their journeys in advance, much like taking a train. The operating times of the subway and trams and buses are coordinated, so getting off one train allows you to catch another.

	There are no dedicated ticket collectors on the subway and trams and buses. Passengers voluntarily insert a 20 Pfennig coin into a special device on the vehicle to print out a ticket, or they punch a pre-purchased ticket. Passengers with monthly passes show their passes to other passengers on the vehicle. It is said that there are occasional checks, but it is rare to find anyone "riding without a ticket."

	Various Museums
	During our tour of the city, we discovered that Berlin has not only the usual historical, artistic, and art museums, but also various other types of museums, including postal, barber, folk, religious, handicraft, worker's life, natural history, and cultural history. Berlin has a wide variety of museums, with more than 20 listed in the tourist guidebook alone.

	Many museums are converted from old churches, with an ancient and elegant exterior. The interior displays make full use of the original church's advantages, thus preserving the ancient architecture while serving the public, truly a harmonious blend.

	The exhibits in the museums are also unique. For example, in a cultural history museum, we saw many glass artifacts in the craft exhibition hall, including wine bottle bases from several hundred years ago, or even earlier, with the family crest or similar patterns of an ancient family engraved on them. They are collected as craft artifacts.

	Berlin's museums not only collect valuable historical and cultural heritage from their own country but also collect treasures from different regions, different ethnic groups, different religious beliefs, and different historical cultures around the world. Visiting these museums not only helps us understand that human history is a development history of diverse civilizations but also makes us proud of the brilliant historical culture that humans have created.

	The City of Peace with Blossoming Flowers
	The scenery of Berlin is so beautiful that it is dazzling: the blue sky is clear and clean, the forests and green spaces are lush, and colorful flowers bloom in parks, green spaces, in front of buildings, and under windows. The people of Berlin proudly told us: there is not an inch of bare land here, everywhere is green life and blooming flowers. Berliners love flowers and gardening. Each balcony with a unique style is like a charming pocket garden, with nothing but blooming flowers and decorative crafts according to personal preferences, and no other clutter.

	The clear and bright Spree River flows gently from east to west through the city, with ducks, cranes, and other waterfowl floating leisurely on the water, and graceful white swans swimming freely.

	In famous places such as Marx-Engels Square and Thälmann Park, many doves symbolizing peace walk around, pecking at food or strolling peacefully, presenting a memorable scene of peace and tranquility. May the god of peace forever bless Berlin.

    柏林街头拾零
    本报记者　苏宁
    春末夏初，记者随人民日报代表团赴民主德国首都柏林访问，时间虽短，但这座美丽而又古老的城市，却给我留下许多难忘的美好印象。
      站牌上的时刻表
    德意志民族循规蹈矩、遵章守纪的认真精神是世界闻名的。就连柏林的公共电、汽车，都严格按照时间表运行。每个电、汽车站的站牌上都有一个运行时间表，人们可以像坐火车一样预先安排好自己的行程。地铁和电、汽车的运行时间相互衔接，下了这趟车，就能赶上另一趟车。
    在地铁和电、汽车上没有专职售票员，全凭乘客自觉地在车上的一个专用设施里，投入20芬尼硬币，摇出一张票来，或自动给预购好的车票打孔。使用月票者上车后则主动向车上的乘客出示一下月票。据说，偶尔也进行抽查，但很少发现有人“逃票”。
    形形色色的博物馆
    游览市容时，我们发现柏林除了一般常见的历史、艺术、美术等博物馆外，还有其它形形色色的博物馆，内容包括邮政、理发、民俗、宗教、手工艺、工人生活、自然历史、文化历史等等。柏林博物馆种类繁多，仅在旅游手册里“榜上有名”的就有20多个。
    很多博物馆是利用原来的教堂改建的，外观古色古香，里面陈设也充分发挥了原教堂的优势，这样既保护了古建筑，又能用于为社会公众服务，真可谓相得益彰。
    博物馆里的展品也很独特，如在一个文化历史博物馆里，我们看到工艺品展厅里展出很多玻璃制品，其中竟有几百年前、甚至更早的酒瓶底子，上面镌刻着某个古老家族的族徽或类似的图案，它们被作为工艺品收藏下来。
    柏林的博物馆不仅收藏本国历史文化的宝贵遗产，而且收藏世界各个不同地区、不同民族、不同宗教信仰、不同历史文化的人类瑰宝。参观了这些博物馆，不仅了解到人类历史是一个多元文明的发展史，而且也为人类曾经创造过这样灿烂辉煌的历史文化感到骄傲。
    鲜花盛开的和平城
    柏林的风光美丽得令人目不暇接：碧蓝的天空洁净如洗，森林、绿地郁郁葱葱，五彩缤纷、争奇斗妍的鲜花怒放在公园、绿地、楼前、窗下。柏林人自豪地对我们说：这里没有一寸裸露着的土地，到处是绿色的生命和盛开的鲜花。柏林人爱花种花。一个个风格各异的阳台，简直就是一个个赏心悦目的袖珍花园，除了盛开的鲜花和根据各人爱好装饰的工艺品，再没有其它任何杂物。
    清澈透亮的施普雷河像一条玉带，由东向西从柏林市区缓缓流过，野鸭、白鹤等水禽悠然自得地浮在水面，洁白秀美的白天鹅也在河里畅游。
    在著名的马克思、恩格斯广场和台尔曼公园等处，许多象征和平的鸽子旁若无人地或低头觅食，或安详踱步，展示出一幅令人难忘的和平、宁静的景象。愿这和平之神永远保佑柏林。
