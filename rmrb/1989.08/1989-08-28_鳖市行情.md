In the Dong segment of Hefei's central vegetable market, there is a famous turtle market. Various types of turtles such as green turtles, mixed turtles, brick turtles, tile turtles, silver plate turtles, and horse hoof turtles are available year-round, with about two to three hundred kilograms coming to market each day. These turtles are sold both locally and in bulk to other regions.

In recent years, the price of turtles has surged, making them a high-end aquatic product. Some customers in the market do not even bother to haggle and simply buy and leave, causing the supply of older turtles to become increasingly scarce. Ordinary families dare not even inquire about the prices.

Recently, there have been subtle changes. During a visit to the turtle market, the reporter saw rows of large plastic basins filled with turtles, their green-bean-sized eyes moving up and down, as ordinary citizens gathered around to observe.

"These are standard green turtles, priced at thirty-four yuan per kilogram. Comrade, would you like to buy some?" As soon as I stood by one stall, the vendor enthusiastically introduced his products.

"Hmm, the price has dropped by four yuan per kilogram compared to a few days ago," a nearby customer muttered to himself.

At that moment, a vendor on the right side loudly called out, "Come and see my turtles, smaller ones, selling at a discount. Twenty yuan per kilogram."

A gray-haired retiree immediately took out ten yuan and bought two turtles. He shook his net bag and said, "In the past, coming here to ask about the price, it was several dozen yuan per kilogram, wanting to eat but couldn't afford it. Now it's cheaper, and we can buy a pound or two to try."

From the west end to the east end of the turtle market, almost every basin of turtles was full, and the prices were similar. Du Yun'an, a commercial and industrial official accompanying me on the market tour, encountered a man leisurely browsing the market. The two struck up a conversation.

"Little Jin, why aren't you acting as a middleman anymore?"

"In the past, restaurants like 'Galaxy' and 'Longevity Spring' would order more than ten kilograms a day. Now they order very little, and the goods can't be sold. Why should I buy turtles?"

Leaving this person, Du told me that this person is named Jin Qisong, an individual business owner. There used to be five or six people like him in the turtle market, specializing in purchasing turtles for the city's dozen or so large hotels and restaurants. People called them "middlemen." Now, the use of public funds for banquets has decreased, and even if there are any, the banquet standards are much lower than before, so high-end dishes like old turtles are no longer served. This reflects, to some extent, the effectiveness of curbing extravagance and promoting clean governance.

    鳖市行情
    新华社记者　陈宝善
    合肥中菜市东段有个鳖市，远近闻名。什么青鳖、混鳖、砖鳖、瓦鳖、银盘鳖、马蹄鳖，四季不断，每天上市两三百公斤，既销售本地，又批发外埠。
    近几年，鳖的身价陡然大升，成为高档水产品，市上有人口不还价，买了就走，以致老鳖越来越紧俏。寻常百姓家则不敢问津。
    最近变化悄然发生。记者到鳖市采访，看见一溜排的塑料大盆里，睁着绿豆样眼睛的老鳖上下翻动，一些普通市民围着观看。
    “这是标准青鳖，三十四元一公斤。同志买吧？”我在一个摊前刚站下，摊主就热情介绍。
    “咦，每公斤比前几天又降四元。”旁边一位顾客自言自语说。
    这时，右边的一家摊主高声喊起来：“看看我的鳖，小一点，便宜卖了。二十元一公斤。”
    一位头发花白，退休工人模样的人当即掏出十元钱，买了两只。他抖抖网袋说：“过去来这里一问，好几十元一公斤，想吃吃不起。现在便宜一些，我们也能买上斤把尝尝鲜。”
    从鳖市的西头到东头，只只鳖盆差不多都满满的，价格也都差不多。陪同我逛市场的工商干部杜云安，这时遇到一个甩手逛市场的人，两人搭讪起来。
    “小金，怎么不当二传手啦？”
    “过去‘银河’、‘寿阳春’这种饭店一天要十多公斤，现在要得很少，货送不掉，我买鳖干什么呢？”
    离开这人，杜同志告诉我，这个人叫金启松，是个个体户。像他这样的人鳖市上原来有五六个，专门给本市的十几家大宾馆、大饭店在市场上代购老鳖，人家就叫他们“二传手”。现在用公款请客的减少，即使有，宴请的标准也比过去大大降低，上不了老鳖之类高档菜了，这从一个侧面反映刹吃喝风、廉政建设的成效。
