Recently, in a grocery store in Lanzhou, the reporter spent over 4 jiao to buy a tube of uniquely packaged small sugar balls for a child. Upon opening it, the reporter found that the small sugar balls inside were worth no more than 5 fen, and by then, it was too late to do anything about it!

Like many consumers, the reporter often experiences such frustrations in daily life. Currently, the market is rife with such dishonest practices, which have sparked strong dissatisfaction among consumers.

According to many consumers and the reporter's observations, some manufacturers are deceiving consumers with attractive packaging. There are two main tactics: First, they make the packaging cost much higher than the production cost of the product itself, selling the "skin" rather than the product, causing consumers to spend a lot of money unnecessarily. Second, some manufacturers produce low-quality products but are unwilling to improve the quality. Instead, they focus on innovative packaging. In daily consumer goods, this phenomenon is particularly severe. Beverages, candies, pastries, biscuits, canned goods, tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, and other products with elaborate packaging are often displayed in stores where consumers cannot easily inspect the contents, leading many to be deceived.

A colleague who studies product packaging and design pointed out that good products, when paired with elegant and distinctive packaging, can be pleasing to the eye and add a unique charm. Some packaging can even be collected as valuable artworks. However, the product itself and its packaging are like "skin" and "fur"—if the "skin" is gone, the "fur" will have nothing to attach to. Deceptive tactics will not be effective in the long run. Product manufacturers should understand this simple truth and stop deceiving people with packaging!

    莫以包装骗人钱
    日前在兰州市一家副食品店，记者花四角多钱给孩子买了一管包装颇有新意的小糖球，不料打开一看，里面的小糖球大约值不上5分钱，连呼上当，已晚矣！
    记者同许许多多消费者一样，在日常生活中饱受这种难言之苦。现在的市场上，类似这种坑人骗钱的不地道做法屡见不鲜，已引起了广大消费者的强烈不满。
    据许多消费者反映和记者观察，现在有些厂家靠好看的包装坑人骗钱，招术有二：一是让商品包装的成本大大高于商品自身的生产成本，靠“货卖一张皮”，使广大消费者多花大把的冤枉钱。二是个别厂家的产品质量本来就十分低劣，又不愿在提高质量上下功夫，于是在包装上不断变花样。在日用消费品方面，这种坑人的现象更为严重。那些包装五花八门的饮料、糖果、糕点、饼干、罐头、烟酒、化妆品等，由于包装考究，在商店里又不好打开，很多人不详其内而上当受骗。
    一位从事商品包装装潢研究的同志指出，好的商品辅之以精美优雅、特色各异的包装装潢，会让人赏心悦目，另生一番情趣，有的包装装潢甚至可以做为珍贵的工艺品收藏。但商品本身和包装装潢毕竟是“皮”和“毛”的关系，“皮之不存，毛将焉附？”骗人的把戏不会长久有效。商品生产者应懂得这个简单的道理，靠包装坑人骗钱的事不要再干了！
