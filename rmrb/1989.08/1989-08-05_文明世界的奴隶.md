In our so-called "civilized" world, there are more than 100 million slaves.

    The "Genuine" Slaves
    In Mauritania, Africa, there are 100,000 "genuine" slaves. Most of these slaves are illiterate and belong to herdsmen. They are descendants of black slaves captured by Arab invaders in the regions south of the Senegal River several hundred years ago, and they have been slaves for generations. After the country gained independence in 1960, the government repeatedly called on herdsmen to free their slaves. In 1980, a compulsory abolition of slavery law was issued, providing compensation to herdsmen who freed their slaves. However, after more than 20 years of effort, some stubborn individuals still refuse to comply, and there are still 100,000 slaves who have not been freed.

    Debt Slaves
    Countries like India have a significant number of "untouchables," whose conditions are similar to those of slaves. Among them, some are debt slaves who have lost their freedom due to debt contracts. Their total number is around 25 million. The "Harijans" in India are the lowest caste in the country, numbering over 100 million. The poorest among them, due to their inability to repay debts, become slaves in the households of their creditors to repay their debts. The number of these debt slaves is estimated to be between 5 million and 20 million, but the official figure recognized is only a few hundred thousand. These debt slaves have no fixed term for their contracts and can only be freed when their masters declare that the "debt has been repaid."

    Pitiful Child Slaves
    According to a report by the International Labour Organization, there are 200 million child laborers under the age of 15 worldwide, some of whom have lost their personal rights and are treated poorly, essentially becoming slaves. Even some developed Western countries have traces of child slaves. The British "Sunday Mail" once exposed this issue with the headline "Scandal—2 million child slaves in Britain." In Italy, at least 500,000 child laborers live in slave-like, inhuman conditions.

    Miserable Female Slaves
    Female slaves are a significant category of slaves. They either become servants or are forced into prostitution. They are a group of people who have completely lost their personal freedom and are at the mercy of others. The five Gulf countries employ more than 400,000 foreign female domestic workers, with Kuwait employing about 100,000. Most of these women are under 30 years old and come from rural areas in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Many of them are deceived and sold by human traffickers to the Gulf markets. Some live in inhuman conditions in their employers' homes, are sexually assaulted by their employers but dare not speak out, are beaten to death or injured with no place to appeal, and some are even forced by their employers to sell their bodies for profit.

### 文明世界的奴隶

    文明世界的奴隶
    在我们这个“文明”世界中，存在着1亿多奴隶。
    “正牌”奴隶　非洲毛里塔尼亚存在10万“正牌”奴隶。这些奴隶多为文盲，属牧主所有，是几百年前阿拉伯人入侵塞内加尔河以南地区时掠回的黑奴的后裔，代代为奴。1960年该国独立后，政府不断号召牧主释放奴隶，1980年发布强制性废奴法令，给释放奴隶的牧主补偿金。但是，经过20多年的努力，还有些死硬派顶着不办，至今仍存10万奴隶未解放。
    债务奴隶　印度等国都有数目可观的“贱民”，他们虽不等于奴隶，但其境遇接近奴隶。其中有一部分是负债立约入债家为奴的，完全失去了自由，被称为“债务奴隶”。总人数达2500万左右。印度的“哈里真人”是该国最下等的种姓，人数逾亿。其中最贫穷的部分，因借债难还而进债主家为奴偿债，其人数一说500万，一说2000万，官方正式承认的只有几十万。这些债务奴隶没有解约期限，直到主人宣布“债务已还清”，自愿释放为止。
    可怜的童奴　据国际劳工组织报告，全球15岁以下童工达2亿人，其中部分失去人身权利，待遇恶劣，实际是奴隶。一些发达的西方国家，也不乏童奴的踪迹。英国《星期日邮报》曾以《丑闻——英国存在200万童奴》为题，揭露了这个问题，意大利至少有50万童工过着奴隶式的非人生活。
    悲惨的女奴　女奴是奴隶中的一大门类，她们或沦为奴仆，或被迫卖淫。她们是一群完全丧失了人身自由、任人宰割的羊羔和泄欲工具。海湾五国共雇佣外国女佣40多万名，其中科威特占10万名左右。她们多是30岁以下的农家女，来自南亚、东南亚，许多人被人贩子骗卖到海湾市场，一些人在雇主家过着非人的日子，被雇主奸淫不敢声张，被打死殴伤也无处申诉，有的甚至被雇主强迫出卖肉体以牟利。
