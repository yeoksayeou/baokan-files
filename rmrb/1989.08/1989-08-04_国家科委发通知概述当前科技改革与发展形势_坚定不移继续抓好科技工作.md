The State Science and Technology Commission today issued a notice, requiring all science and technology departments and the broad masses of science and technology personnel across the country to take the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party as a new starting point for China's science and technology work. They are to continue, as before, to be bold in exploration and innovation, and to firmly grasp and do a good job of the current science and technology work.

The notice states that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, especially since the issuance of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Reform of the Science and Technology System," China's science and technology work, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, has adhered to the policy of reform and opening up and achieved remarkable results, which have had a great impact both domestically and internationally. In recent years, the broad masses of science and technology workers have resolutely implemented the central government's strategic policy that economic construction must rely on science and technology, and that science and technology work must be oriented towards economic construction. They have made unremitting efforts on all fronts to promote scientific and technological progress and the development of the science and technology cause, achieving remarkable progress. In the reform of the science and technology system, the reform of the operating mechanism has driven the adjustment of the organizational structure and the reform of the management system for science and technology personnel. With the commercialization of technological achievements as the turning point, a technology market has been established and developed; different management methods for tasks and funds have been implemented for different types of scientific and technological activities; the management policies for scientific research institutions and science and technology personnel have been relaxed and activated, promoting the entry of science and technology into the economy in various forms; the important policies of promoting scientific and technological progress in enterprises and rural areas and promoting horizontal cooperation between science and technology and the economy have been implemented. New management systems such as the scientific fund system, technical contract system, lump-sum system, director responsibility system, and contract management responsibility system have been implemented, effectively promoting the combination of science and technology with the economy and the development of science and technology itself.

The notice states that in recent years, reform and opening up have been closely combined with development and improvement, gradually forming a science and technology work layout with three levels: facing the main battlefield of economic construction, tracking high-tech research and promoting its industrial development, and strengthening basic research and applied research. While continuing to implement the national science and technology key projects, the "Spark" program has been implemented nationwide to serve the revitalization of rural economy, and extensive science and technology poverty alleviation work has been carried out; the high-tech research and development program and the "Torch" program for the development of high-tech industries have been promoted, and a number of high-tech industrial experimental zones have been established; policies and measures to strengthen basic research have been formulated; the promotion and application of scientific and technological achievements have been promoted, and the digestion and absorption of introduced technologies have been strengthened. Progress has also been made in strengthening the construction of science and technology policies and regulations and soft science research, and in vigorously developing international science and technology cooperation and exchanges.

The notice requires that all science and technology departments and the broad masses of science and technology workers firmly grasp and implement the various policies, plans, and tasks of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council on the reform of the science and technology system and the work of science and technology development. They should seriously grasp and do a good job of the tasks deployed in the government work report of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. In reform and opening up, they should continue to advocate the spirit of bold exploration and innovation. Currently, they should focus on doing a good job of rectification and deepening reform work, combining their own specific situations to summarize and analyze the experience, shortcomings, and mistakes in science and technology work, and actively improve and perfect specific policies and measures. They should vigorously promote scientific and technological progress in rural areas and enterprises, especially large and medium-sized enterprises; in science and technology foreign affairs activities, they should actively and broadly carry out work, strive to ensure that official, non-official, bilateral, and multilateral international science and technology cooperation and exchange plans, projects, and activities are implemented as planned, and actively create conditions to strive for greater development.
