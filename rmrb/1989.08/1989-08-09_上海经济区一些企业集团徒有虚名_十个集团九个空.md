The term "enterprise group" has emerged as a new type of economic organization in China over the past two years. According to investigations, there are more than 2,000 such enterprises nationwide that are either called enterprise groups or have the initial characteristics of enterprise groups. In the Shanghai Economic Zone, which includes the provinces and municipalities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian, and Anhui, there are more than 700 to 800 of these new-type enterprises, which combine, control, and link more than 10,000 enterprises and institutions.

However, upon closer examination of some of these enterprise groups, we found that many of them are merely names without substance. As some comrades have put it: "Out of ten groups, nine are empty."

The Hangzhou West Lake Electronics Group has 97 member units, spanning 11 provinces and municipalities, with fixed assets of 600 million yuan, 54,000 employees, an annual industrial output value of 2.3 billion yuan, and taxes and profits of 400 million yuan. Its strength is indeed formidable. However, upon checking its registration, it was found that its registered capital is only 10 million yuan, which is not even a fraction of the 80 million yuan in fixed assets of its subsidiary, the Hangzhou Television Factory. Therefore, some peers jokingly refer to it as the "empty West Lake."

The relevant departments in Hangzhou City conducted a survey, and it was found that all 14 enterprise groups in the city with a certain influence are in a similar situation to "West Lake."

Why does this phenomenon exist? Economists believe that the fluctuations and changes in reform policies, as well as the inertia of traditional ideas, have made it difficult for enterprise groups to overcome numerous obstacles from the moment they were born.

The purpose of the birth and development of enterprise groups is to seek the reallocation of existing resources and to achieve the optimization of production factors. However, the government initially advocated enterprise mergers on the premise of "three unchanges" in ownership, affiliation, and fiscal remittance channels. This essentially does not allow enterprises to reallocate resources and optimize production factors, and enterprise groups born under such conditions are bound to fall into difficulties. Later, although the "three unchanges" were abolished, national policies in the reform process have undergone some reversals: the segmented management system originally could not make administrative interference withdraw from the economic field, but measures such as separate fiscal management have further strengthened local interests and further intensified market fragmentation and closure.

Moreover, people demand the establishment of groups, but their thinking is still stuck in the horizontal economic association category. Many groups are formed with an eye on short-term interests, such as finding a backer, dividing some products to get through production difficulties; solving the danger of raw materials, establishing a stable supply channel; and so on. Therefore, the current establishment of enterprise groups can only be large enterprises combining small enterprises, profitable enterprises merging, leasing, or taking over bankrupt or severely loss-making enterprises. True optimization of combinations and strong-strong alliances are difficult to achieve.

Members of the group believe that the key to establishing a group at present is the distribution of interests. Therefore, to get rid of the difficulties faced by enterprise groups, a mechanism that can coordinate the interests of all parties must be found. At present, many places are developing enterprise groups from the three aspects of enterprise mergers, equity participation, and enterprise contracting enterprises, and have achieved good results. Therefore, some comrades suggest, can enterprise groups be allowed to take the lead in these three aspects of reform? In this way, by adjusting the asset relationship to carry out in-depth reform, and combined with other reform measures, enterprise groups will gradually become substantial.

### 上海经济区一些企业集团徒有虚名  “十个集团九个空”

    上海经济区一些企业集团徒有虚名
    “十个集团九个空”
    有关人士认为：进行深层次改革，配上其他措施，这种新型经济组织才会逐步“实”起来
    据新华社上海8月9日电　记者马常青、李巍、李正华述评：“企业集团”作为一种新崛起的经济组织，近两年来在我国迅速发展。据调查，全国称为企业集团或初具企业集团性质的新型企业已达2000家以上。上海经济区所辖江、浙、沪、闽、皖5省市，就有这类新型企业七八百家，组合、控制、联系的企事业单位达1万家以上。
    但是，当我们深入了解了一些企业集团的实际后，却发现不少集团徒有虚名。正如有的同志所说：
  “十个集团九个空”。
    杭州西湖电子集团有97个成员单位，横跨11个省市，拥有固定资产6亿元，职工5.4万名，年工业总产值23亿元，税利4亿元，实力可谓强矣。可是一查“户口”，它的注册资金只有100万元，不抵它所属的杭州电视机厂8000多万元固定资产的“零头”。由此，一些同行戏称它是“空荡荡的西湖”。
    杭州市有关部门作过一次调查，全市14家有一定影响的企业集团，都类似“西湖”的境遇。
    为什么会产生这一现象？经济界的同志认为，改革政策的波动变化，思想观念上的习惯势力，使企业集团从它“脱胎”开始，就面临着重重障碍。
    企业集团的诞生和发展，目的是寻求现有资源的重新配置，实现生产要素的优化组合。但是政府当初倡导企业间的联合却是以所有制、隶属关系和财政上缴渠道“三不变”为前提的。这实际上是不允许企业重置资源和优化生产要素，在这种情况下诞生的企业集团必然陷于困境。后来虽然取消了“三不变”的提法，然而国家政策在改革中又发生了一些倒置：条块分割的体制本来就不能使行政干预退出经济领域，而财政分灶吃饭等措施，却更强化了地方的利益动机，进一步加强了市场的分裂与封闭。
    另外，人们要求组建集团，而思想却在横向联合体的范畴里徘徊。不少集团是着眼于短期利益组合起来的，如为了找一个靠山，分一点产品，以渡生产难关；为解决原材料之危，搞一个稳定的供应渠道；等等。因此，目前企业集团的组建，只能是大企业联小企业，盈利企业兼并、租赁倒闭或严重亏损的企业。真正的优化组合、强强联合就很难。
    集团界的同志认为，目前组建集团的关键是利益分配问题。因此要摆脱企业集团面临的困难，必须找出一个能协调各方利益的机制来。现在不少地方从企业兼并、参股控股和企业承包企业三方面入手发展企业集团，取得了较好的效果。由此，不少同志建议，能否允许企业集团在这三方面的改革上先走一步？这样从调整资产关系上进行深层次改革，再配上其他改革措施，企业集团一定会逐步“实”起来的。
