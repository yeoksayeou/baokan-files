On July 31, the foreign ministers of the Arab Three-Party Committee issued a statement in Algiers, announcing that the committee's efforts to resolve the Lebanese crisis had reached an impasse. They would provide a detailed report to the leaders of Arab countries on the committee's work to resolve the Lebanese crisis, in order to reconsider efforts to help Lebanon out of its disaster. The failure of the Arab League's mediation efforts has made the deteriorating situation in Lebanon even more worrying.

In May of this year, the most important agenda item at the Arab Summit in Casablanca was the Lebanese crisis. After extensive discussions and consultations, the summit established a three-party committee composed of the King of Saudi Arabia, the King of Morocco, and the President of Algeria to replace the six-party committee, led by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah, which had been working for nearly half a year to resolve the Lebanese crisis. From the outset, the three-party committee held frequent meetings and consultations to study and implement the measures and opportunities to resolve the Lebanese crisis within a six-month deadline, as previously determined in Rabat and Oran. To quickly restore stability in Lebanon, the plan was to start with specific measures such as consolidating the ceasefire, opening the east and west passages in Beirut, and lifting the blockade on the eastern region. Then, the transition would be made to achieving dialogue among the relevant parties. The three-party committee also suggested holding the Lebanese Parliament sessions outside Lebanon to facilitate the restoration of normal activities of constitutional institutions and the political reform of Lebanese society, thereby achieving justice, peace, and reconciliation, and thoroughly avoiding the division and civil war in Lebanon.

The foreign ministers of the three-party committee and the Arab League envoy Ibrahim received the committee's mandate to shuttle between Beirut, Damascus, and Baghdad, the capitals of the relevant Arab countries, over a short period of two months. They held multiple consultations with the leaders of these countries on the committee's plans and schemes and mediated and reconciled among the relevant factions in Lebanon.

After contacting the relevant parties in Lebanon, the Muslim and Christian factions expressed support and cooperation for the three-party committee's efforts on the surface, but their opinions diverged greatly on specific issues, and the committee's efforts yielded no results. The east and west passages in Beirut remained closed, the eastern port was still under blockade, and the international airport remained closed. As for holding parliamentary sessions outside Lebanon, the deputies of the two major Christian and Muslim factions argued endlessly and could not reach a consensus.

During consultations with the Syrian leadership, the Syrian side reluctantly agreed to open the east and west passages, but when discussing security and formal reform issues, the Syrian side insisted that Lebanon must first carry out political reforms, including ceasefires, and all security measures should be addressed later. The Syrian side also advocated establishing comprehensive relations between Syria and Lebanon, including strategic security, economic, and social fields. This was far from the thoughts of the three-party committee, and the talks remained at a standstill.

Just as the three-party committee was making every effort to mediate the various contradictions to ease the Lebanese crisis, the armed conflicts between the Christian faction led by Lebanese military government Prime Minister Oren and the Muslim faction's armed forces escalated. Oren called for a "liberation war" by the Christian faction to drive the Syrian army out of Lebanon. The Muslim faction, citing Iraq's supply of missiles and advanced weapons to Oren, continuously strengthened the defense of the eastern port, and both sides frequently used cannons and missiles to bombard each other's residential areas, resulting in the deaths of many civilians. Since March of this year, three-quarters of Beirut's residents have fled. Foreign media described Beirut as a "ghost city." Facing Oren's challenge, Syria intensified its support for the Muslim faction, continuously escalating the civil war. Syria expressed its refusal to negotiate with Oren and stated that Oren could no longer be a party to the negotiations, thus blocking the path to dialogue between the two sides.

Facing the difficult Lebanese crisis, the three-party committee's mediation efforts were extremely arduous. The long-suffering Lebanese people, while deeply disappointed by the results of the three-party committee's statement, still hoped that they would rally and make a final effort to resolve the Lebanese crisis.

    调解黎巴嫩危机的艰难努力
    本报记者　吕志星
    7月31日，阿拉伯3方委员会外长在阿尔及尔发表一项公报，宣布三方委员会解决黎巴嫩危机的努力已陷入绝境，他们将向阿拉伯各国领导人提供一份有关给委员会解决黎危机工作情况的详尽报告，以便重新考虑寻求帮助黎巴嫩摆脱灾难的努力。阿盟调解努力受挫，使日益恶化的黎巴嫩局势更加令人忧虑。
    今年5月，在卡萨布兰卡举行的阿拉伯首脑会议上，首脑们提出的最重要的议题就是黎巴嫩危机。会议经过充分的讨论和协商，成立了一个以沙特国王、摩洛哥国王和阿尔及利亚总统组成的三方委员会，取代了以科威特外交大臣萨巴赫为首的为解决黎巴嫩危机而奔走近半年的六方委员会。三方委员会成立伊始，首脑们就进行了频繁的会晤和协商，研究贯彻和执行先后在拉巴特和奥兰确定的限期6个月的解决黎巴嫩危机的机会和措施。为使黎巴嫩尽快恢复安定局面，计划首先从巩固停火、开放贝鲁特东、西通道和解除对东区封锁等具体措施着手，然后过渡到实现有关各方进行对话。三方委员会还建议，在黎巴嫩以外的地方召开黎巴嫩议会会议，以便利议员们协商恢复宪法机构的正常活动和进行黎巴嫩社会的政治改革，进而实现公正、和平与和解，彻底避免黎巴嫩的分裂和内战。
    三方委员会外长和阿盟特使易卜拉希米受委员会的委托，在短短的两个月时间内，穿梭于贝鲁特、大马士革和巴格达等有关阿拉伯国家首都，同这些国家的领导人就委员会计划和方案进行多次磋商，并在黎巴嫩有关各派间进行斡旋和调解。
    在同黎有关各方接触后，穆斯林教派和基督教派对三方委员会的努力，表面上表示支持和合作，但在具体问题上，两派意见大相径庭，三方委员会的努力未取得任何成果。贝鲁特东西区通道迟迟不能开放，东区港口始终处于封锁状态，国际机场一直关闭，至于在黎巴嫩以外的地方召开议会会议问题，基督教和穆斯林两大教派议员更是争吵不休，难以取得一致意见。
    三方委员会在同叙利亚领导人磋商时，叙方勉强同意开放东西区通道，而在讨论安全和正式改革问题时，叙方坚持黎巴嫩必须首先进行政治改革，包括停火在内的各项安全措施都应放到以后解决。叙方还主张，叙黎应建立包括战略安全、经济、社会等领域的全面关系。这同三方委员会的想法相去甚远，会谈始终踏步不前。
    就在三方委员会竭尽努力调解各方矛盾，以缓和黎巴嫩危机的时刻，以黎军政府总理奥恩为首的基督教派同穆斯林教派武装力量的武装冲突不断升级。奥恩号召基督教派进行一场“解放战争”，把叙利亚军队赶出黎巴嫩。而穆斯林教派以伊拉克向奥恩运送了导弹和先进武器为由，不断加强对东区港口的防守，双方不时使用大炮和导弹，轰击对方的居民区，使大批平民丧生。自今年3月以来，贝鲁特已有3／4的居民逃离。外电称贝鲁特城已成为“鬼城”。面对奥恩的挑战，叙利亚加紧支持穆斯林教派，不断使内战升级。叙表示拒绝同奥恩会谈，并称奥恩已不能作为谈判的一方，这就堵死了双方对话的道路。
    面对棘手的黎巴嫩危机，三方委员会的调解努力举步维艰。饱经忧患的黎巴嫩人民在对三方委员会公报结果深感失望的同时，仍然渴望他们重振旗鼓，为解决黎巴嫩危机作最后的努力。
