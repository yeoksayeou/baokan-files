In October 1987, after Wang Xuwu took office as the director of our county's agricultural electricity bureau, the first thing he thought about was how to submit a satisfactory answer sheet to the Party and the people. Through investigations and research, he discovered that the county's power grid was outdated and in disrepair, reaching its limit of use, with frequent accidents and an average annual power loss of around 200,000 kWh, causing significant losses to the state, collectives, and individuals. Therefore, after careful consideration, it was decided to upgrade and transform the county's power grid. Facing financial difficulties, Wang Xuwu proposed that starting from June 1, 1988, over a period of three years, every electricity user in the county would pay an additional 0.02 yuan per kWh to solve the problem of funding shortages. The county people's congress quickly discussed and approved this proposal.

After several months of preparation, the first phase of the town's voltage-raising project was launched in October of the previous year. Director Wang was either personally directing the frontline operations or helping with material procurement and transportation. He also paid great attention to the welfare and safety of the construction team members, promptly addressing their thoughts and political work.

This phase of the project involved the transformation of 155.9 kilometers of power distribution lines, the replacement and transformation of 84 energy-saving transformers, and the addition of 171 drop-out switches, benefiting 22 villages and 26 enterprises and institutions. It is estimated that this will save 577,000 kWh of electricity annually, increasing the enterprise's economic benefits by more than 60,000 yuan and the social economic benefits by 1.58 million yuan. Currently, he is working tirelessly to complete the comprehensive upgrade and transformation of the power grid, aiming to build a standardized electric county.

    富裕县农电局长的答卷——
     更新改造供电网络
    1987年10月，王旭武同志走马上任我县农电局长后，首先想到的是怎样向党和人民交上一份满意的答卷。他通过调查研究，发现全县供电网络年久失修，已到使用极限，事故不断，平均年损失电量达20万度左右，给国家、集体、个人造成很大损失。为此，经过研究，决定对全县供电网络进行更新改造。针对资金困难，王旭武提出了从1988年6月1日起，利用3年时间，采取全县用电户每度电附加2分钱的办法，解决资金短缺问题的建议，县人大会议很快讨论通过。
    经过几个月的准备，第一个镇内升压工程战役于去年10月打响了。王局长不是亲临一线指挥，就是帮忙备料、运料。他还十分关心施工队员的冷暖和安全，及时做好职工的思想政治工作。
    这期工程共改造配电线路155.9公里，更换改造节能变压器84台，新增跌落开关171只，使22个村和26个企事业单位受益。预计每年节电57.7万度，增加本企业经济效益6万多元、社会经济效益158万元。而今，他正在为全面地完成供电网络的更新改造任务，建成标准化电气县而忘我工作着。
