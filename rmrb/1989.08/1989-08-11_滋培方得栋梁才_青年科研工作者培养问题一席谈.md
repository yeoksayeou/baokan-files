Graduates assigned to research institutions feel honored to participate in the construction of a socialist, modernized motherland and to make contributions. However, some do not know how to improve their research capabilities. The reporter visited Zong Shaolu, a research fellow at the Chinese Aerospace Standardization Research Institute, a rocket guidance expert, and deputy director of the Science and Technology Commission, who has extensive experience in cultivating young scientific and technological personnel. The reporter asked him to share his views on this issue.

Reporter: University graduates transitioning from campus to research institutions inevitably go through an adaptation process. Could you discuss the research capabilities they should possess upon entering the workplace and the areas in which they should continue to cultivate and deepen their knowledge?

Zong Shaolu: The fundamental quality of a research worker is, first and foremost, creativity. Creativity is the soul of a research worker. Without creativity, there is no research activity. Since research activities involve exploring unknown laws, researchers must always maintain a productive creative force to secure a place in the unknown scientific realm and become pioneers in their field. Behind every major research achievement lies the vibrant creative ability of the researchers.

Secondly, there is practicality. The source of research topics and research ideas comes from practical needs. Throughout history, including mathematical sciences, all disciplines have emerged and developed due to practical needs. Practical needs and problems that arise in practice are the sources of creative new ideas and the foundation of research work. In our country, research topics derived from practical needs align with the main theme of socialist modernization, thus possessing strong vitality. A scientist with profound knowledge often demonstrates the ability to propose topics based on practical needs and establish correct, creative new ideas.

Reporter: Do you think the professional knowledge of university graduates is sufficient for research work?

Zong Shaolu: A research worker should have a deep understanding of their specialized knowledge and a broad foundation of basic knowledge, which is also a very important research capability. Graduating from university only indicates that they have learned a part of the most basic knowledge in their major, and they are still far from mastering all of the specialized knowledge. Additionally, our educational structure has some deficiencies. University students rarely encounter related knowledge from other disciplines during their studies, resulting in shallow and narrow learning. To become a genuine research expert, one must not only be proficient in their major but also expand and penetrate into related disciplines. Especially mathematics, it is a discipline that is very useful for all research work. Mastering modern mathematical analysis methods is beneficial for scientific research in any discipline.

Reporter: Non-intellectual factors of research personnel should also not be overlooked, right?

Zong Shaolu: Yes. Firstly, perseverance is particularly important for research workers. Generally, major achievements are made after multiple failures. Failure is a part of success. Research workers often feel "at the end of their rope," and at this time, only those who dare to face difficulties, persist, and overcome obstacles can achieve success and reach a new horizon. The joy of research workers overcoming difficulties and achieving results is no less than that of mountain climbers reaching the summit, and it is truly indescribable.

Secondly, a research worker should have a good spirit of cooperation. Modern research activities are vastly different from the old-style scientific activities of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were based on individual efforts. Today's research activities are characterized by large-scale, broad professional scope, and deep mutual penetration, reflecting the group effect of research workers. This requires scientists to have both individual creativity and a cooperative spirit. It is difficult to achieve major research results by working in isolation today.

A rigorous research style is also indispensable. A scientific worker should be serious and meticulous in every formula derivation, every experimental detail arrangement, every result analysis, and every technical report writing. Any small oversight can lead to complete failure. In scientific research, one must advocate for "bold imagination" while being "cautious and meticulous."

Additionally, research workers should have solid basic skills. For example, a high level of foreign language proficiency, the ability to skillfully use electronic computers. Even to fully utilize scientific and technological information, one must also master a high level of written and expressive skills.

Reporter: From which aspects should young research personnel be cultivated to quickly form the aforementioned research capabilities?

Zong Shaolu: Young research workers should be educated in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and in materialism and dialectics, to correct their guiding ideology of learning and working for the modernization of the four aspects of our country. Only in this way can they not fear hardship, not fear failure, dare to strive, and achieve results in research work.

In cultivating research capabilities, I believe the following aspects should be noted.

Firstly, give young people responsibilities, let them undertake research topics, so they can learn by doing and apply what they learn. When the task of the topic is placed on their shoulders, they will find that what they learned in school is not enough, and they will actively seek advice from senior researchers, consult materials, conduct investigations, and address their own weaknesses. This method of learning and applying knowledge in combination accelerates the growth of young research workers, achieving the goals of producing results, talents, and benefits.

Secondly, "mentoring by seniors" is also very important. Senior researchers, after decades of research work, have developed good research capabilities. This is something that cannot be learned from books. Only through the research process itself and the personal guidance of senior scientists can one truly learn. Strict teachers produce excellent students, and the guidance, help, and mentoring of senior colleagues play a crucial role in the growth of young scientific and technological personnel. In the process of mentoring by seniors, senior researchers can also learn many new things from their younger colleagues.

Reporter: Young people who are new to research institutions often feel aimless and unsure of where to start, which is very detrimental to their growth.

Zong Shaolu: This requires giving them an early professional development direction and formulating short-term plans and long-term development ideas based on each individual's characteristics. Only in this way can young people have a goal to strive for, have a direction to follow in their professional development, and achieve the purpose of encouraging young scientific and technological personnel to progress. Of course, having a plan requires measures, and the implementation process should be checked.

Conditions should also be created to allow young research workers to participate in various academic conferences, professional conferences, professional training classes, audit university professional courses and graduate courses, and visit professional exhibitions. Let them receive and utilize more scientific and technological information, activate academic thoughts, and broaden academic horizons.

    滋培方得栋梁才
    ——青年科研工作者培养问题一席谈
    本报记者　柏生
    分配在科研单位的一些大学毕业生为能参加社会主义祖国四化建设并做出贡献感到十分光荣，同时也感到担子很重。但有的人不懂得如何提高科研素质。记者走访了对培养青年科技人员颇有经验的中国航天标准化研究所研究员、火箭制导专家、科技委员会副主任宗绍录同志，请他谈谈对这一问题的认识和看法。
    记者：大学生从校园到研究所势必有一个适应过程，您能否谈谈他们走上工作岗位后应该具备哪些科研素质，应在哪些方面继续培养和深造呢？
    宗绍录：科研工作者的基本素质，第一是创造性。创造性是科研工作者的灵魂。没有创造性，就没有科研活动。科研活动既然是探索未知规律的活动，科研人员就必须始终保持富有成效的创造力才能在未知的科学领域中占有一席之地，才能成为该领域的先锋。每一项重大科研成果后面都跃动着科研人员勃发的创造能力。
    第二是实际性。科研课题的来源，科研“思想”（idea）的来源都出于实际需要。追古索今，包括数学科学在内的所有学科都是由于实际的需要而产生并发展的。实际的需要、实际中出现的问题是产生创造性新思想的源泉，是科研工作之本。在我国，从实际需要产生的科研课题切合着社会主义现代化的主旋律，因而具有强大的生命力。一个有造诣的科学家常常表现在能够依据实际需要提出课题并建立起正确的富有创造性的新思想。
    记者：那么，您认为大学毕业生的专业知识在科研工作中是否够用了呢？
    宗绍录：一个科研工作者应具有深厚的专业知识及广阔的基本知识，这也是很重要的科研素质。大学毕了业只表明他学到本专业一部分最基本的知识，距掌握全部的专业知识还相差甚远。另外，我国教育结构有一定缺陷，大学生在校时很少涉及与本专业有关的其它专业知识，所学不深不广。要成为一个名副其实的科研专家不只要成为本专业知识的行家里手，也要对相关专业进行扩展及渗透。尤其是数学，它是对所有科研工作都十分有用的学科，掌握现代数学分析方法对从事任何专业的科学研究工作都有用。
    记者：科研人员的非智力因素应该也是不容忽视的吧？
    宗绍录：是的。首先，坚韧不拔的毅力对科研工作者特别重要。一般来说，重大成果都是在多次失败的基础上取得的。失败是成功的一部分。科研工作者经常会感到“山穷水尽疑无路”，在这时，只有那些知难而进、锲而不舍、勇于克服困难的人才能摘取成功桂冠，抵达“柳暗花明又一村”的境界。科研工作者克服艰难险阻取得了科研成果，那种欣喜若狂的心情不亚于登山运动员登上高山险峰，真是难以言表。
    其次，一个科研人员应具有良好的协作精神。当代的科研活动规模之大、专业面之广、相互渗透之深等方面大大不同于十八、十九世纪那种古老的以个人为单位的科学活动，而是体现着科研工作者的群体效应。这就要求科学家既要有个人独创又要有相互协作精神。闭关自守、单干搞科研在今天很难搞出重大的科研成果。
    严谨的科研作风也是不可缺少的。一个科学工作者对于每一个公式的推导，对于每一个试验细节的安排，对于试验结果的分析，对于书写技术报告都应严肃认真、一丝不苟。任何细小的疏忽都可能导致全盘失败。在科学研究上既要提倡“大胆设想”，又必须“谨小慎微”。
    另外，科研工作者还应具有扎实的基本功。例如较高的外语水平，熟练使用电子计算机的能力。甚至为了能充分利用科技信息，还须掌握较高水平的文字及书写表达能力。
    记者：应从哪些方面对青年科研人员进行培养，才能使之尽快形成上述科研素质呢？
    宗绍录：要对青年科研工作者进行马列主义、毛泽东思想的教育，进行唯物论与辩证法的教育，使他们端正为祖国四个现代化而学习和工作的指导思想。只有这样才能在科研工作中不怕吃苦，不怕失败，敢于拚搏并做出成绩来。
    在科研素质培养上，我认为应注意下面几个环节。
    第一，给年轻人压担子，让他们承担科研课题，才能边干边学，学以致用。当课题任务压到他们肩上时，学校学的不够用，他们就会主动请教老科研人员，查阅资料、搞调查研究，针对自己弱点缺什么补什么。这种学用结合的培养方法使青年科研人员成长较快，达到出成果、出人才、出效益的目的。
    第二，“以老带新”也很重要。老科研人员经过几十年科研工作的磨练，具备了较好的科研素质。这是在书本上学不到的。只有通过科研过程本身，只有通过老科学工作者的言传身教，才能学到手。严师出高徒，老同志的传、帮、带，对于青年科技人员的成长起了关键作用。在以老带新过程中，老科研人员也可以向青年同志学到不少新的东西。
    记者：一些年轻人新到科研单位往往会有无所事事、无从下手之感，这对他们的成长是很不利的。
    宗绍录：这就需要给他们尽早规定专业发展方向，针对每个人的特点制订近期规划及长远发展设想。这样才能使年轻人有奔头，在专业发展上有方向可循，起到激励青年科技人员上进的目的。当然，有规划，就要有措施，对其实施过程要有检查。
    还应创造条件让青年科研人员参加各种学术会议、专业会议、专业学习班，旁听大学专业课及研究生课程，参观专业展览。让他们更多的接收和利用科技信息，活跃学术思想，扩大学术视野。
