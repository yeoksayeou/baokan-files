Title: A Major Misunderstanding in Chinese Pharmaceutical History: Current Calcium Supplements All Mislabel Calcium Content

If you are deficient in calcium and follow your doctor's advice to take a certain type of calcium tablet three times a day, two tablets each time, you are actually only taking 1/10 of the prescribed calcium amount! This is because all current calcium supplements in China mislabel the calcium content. This conclusion is based on years of research by Mi Zhao, a deputy researcher at the Trauma Orthopedics Research Institute of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. His findings sparked considerable thought and attention at a recent national conference on calcium and phosphorus metabolism.

Mi Zhao pointed out that there are significant issues with the calcium supplement market in China. Currently, a large number of chemically synthesized calcium supplements, such as calcium gluconate and calcium lactate, are widely used. These supplements have high solubility but very low calcium content. Calcium gluconate contains only 9% calcium, while calcium lactate contains about 12%. The most serious problem is that manufacturers and clinical doctors have been confused about the dosage of these synthetic calcium supplements. Manufacturers indicate the "calcium content" in the drug instructions as the "total drug amount" and incorrectly specify the daily dosage based on the total drug amount. As a result, doctors prescribe the dosage as indicated by the manufacturers, leading patients to consume only 9% to 12% of the required calcium amount. For example, the instructions for calcium gluconate state that each tablet contains 0.5 grams of calcium, but in reality, it contains only 45 milligrams, making the total drug amount and the actual calcium content differ by a factor of 11.

Some pediatricians, when treating rickets in children with no apparent effect, mistakenly believe that the calcium is not being absorbed. They then shift the treatment focus to high doses of vitamin D. Reports indicate that in some regions, the use of vitamin D exceeds the physiological requirement by tens of times, leading to a significant increase in cases of vitamin D poisoning. This is a major misunderstanding in pharmaceutical history! Mi Zhao emphasized that this issue needs urgent attention and resolution.

### 我国药剂史上空前的误解  现有钙剂均标错钙含量

    我国药剂史上空前的误解
    现有钙剂均标错钙含量
    如果你缺钙，并遵医嘱每日3次、每次服某种钙片2片时，其实你才服用了应服钙量的1／10！因为我国现有钙剂均标错了钙含量。这是北京积水潭医院创伤骨科研究所副研究员米昭曾经多年研究得出的结论。在不久前召开的全国钙磷代谢讨论会上，他的这一论断引起了医务界和有关方面的思考和重视。
    米昭曾认为，我国钙剂市场存在较大问题，目前大量应用的是以葡萄糖酸钙、乳酸钙为代表的化学合成钙剂，其溶解度高但钙含量却很低。葡萄糖酸钙含钙量仅为9％，乳酸钙也不过12％。最为严重的是，生产厂家和临床医生对这类合成钙剂的运用剂量始终混淆不清。厂家在药品说明中标示的“钙含量”实际是“全药量”，并错误地按全药量指定了每天的用量，致使医生照搬厂家规定的用量开出处方。这样，无数患者只服用了应用钙量的9％—12％。以葡萄糖酸钙为例，药品说明文中标出每片含钙0.5克，事实上仅为45毫克，全药量和钙含量整整差11倍。
    一些儿科医生治小儿佝偻病不见效时误认为是钙不被吸收，于是将治疗重点错误地转向大剂量维生素D。据报道，某地区维生素D用量竟超过生理需要量数十倍，致使维生素D中毒患儿猛增，这是药剂史上空前的误解！米昭曾说，上述现象亟须引起重视并应尽快加以解决。
