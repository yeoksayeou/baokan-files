The second China-Japan Go Championship began today in Shanghai. After a 7-hour and 45-minute intense battle, Japan's Cho Chikun defeated China's Liu Xiaoguang by one and three-quarters points.

This is the first match of this year's China-Japan Championship. As in the previous year, Cho Chikun won the coin toss and chose to play black, adopting the "star small knight" formation. Liu Xiaoguang responded with the "wrong small knight" formation, aiming to disrupt the opponent's "Chinese style" setup. On the 22nd move, Liu Xiaoguang took half an hour to consider his move, falling into a passive position. In the morning, both players made 24 moves. In the afternoon, when Liu Xiaoguang made his 122nd move, he made a mistake, allowing Cho Chikun to take the lead in the endgame and maintain his advantage until the end of the game.

    第二届中日围棋天元赛
    日本赵治勋胜刘小光
    新华社上海8月23日电  （记者郭礼华）第二届中日围棋天元赛今天在上海开战。经过7小时45分钟的鏖战，日本的赵治勋胜中国刘小光一又四分之三子。
    这是本年度中日天元赛的首局比赛。与上届一样，赵治勋幸运地猜得了黑棋，并以“星小目”的布阵；刘小光则以“错小目”相对，意在破坏对方构成“中国流”阵式。在第22手时，刘小光长考半小时，一度处于被动。上午双方共下了24手，下午刘小光行至第122手时，一着不慎，使赵治勋先手收官，并一直保持优势至终局。
