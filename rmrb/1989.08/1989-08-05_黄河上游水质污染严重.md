The environmental geology comprehensive evaluation report on the section of the Yellow River from Longyangxia to Liujiaxia, submitted by the 906 Hydrogeological and Engineering Geological Brigade of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, indicates that due to the increasing amount of wastewater and waste discharged into the Yellow River along its banks, and the lack of effective measures to prevent water pollution, the water quality in the upper Yellow River is becoming increasingly severe. The content of some harmful and toxic ions exceeds the national drinking water standards, seriously threatening the health of the people living along the Yellow River.

Since 1972, the content of harmful and toxic ions in the Yellow River has been increasing year by year. Starting from 1973, ions such as arsenic, volatile phenols, mercury, hexavalent chromium, hydrogen sulfide, and oil have appeared in the Yellow River water. According to measurements, the content of arsenic, volatile phenols, and mercury ions all exceed the national drinking water standards by 2-3 times. Hydrogen sulfide, hexavalent chromium, and oil also exceed the standards to varying degrees. The water quality of major tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Daxia River, the Tao River, and the Huangshui River, also contains harmful and toxic substances that exceed the standards.

The reasons for the increasingly severe water pollution in the upper Yellow River are: first, some factories and enterprises along the banks of the upper Yellow River have not taken any pollution prevention measures and have been randomly discharging wastewater, exhaust gases, and waste residues; second, the management of domestic waste by residents along the banks is poor, and some directly dump it into the river.

    黄河上游水质污染严重
    地质矿产部九○六水文地质工程地质大队提交的黄河上游龙羊峡至刘家峡段《环境地质综合评价报告》表明，由于沿岸排入黄河的污废水日益增加，防治水质污染措施又不得力，致使黄河上游水质污染日趋严重，部分有害有毒离子含量大大超过国家生活饮水标准，严重威胁着黄河沿岸人民的身体健康。
    自1972年以来，黄河水体中有害有毒离子逐年增加。从1973年起，黄河水体中出现砷、挥发性酚、汞、六价铬、氢化物、油类等离子。据测定，砷、挥发性酚、汞3种离子数均超过国家生活用水标准的2—3倍。氢化物、六价铬、油类也不同程度超标。黄河大型支流大夏河、洮河、湟水等水质中也有超标有害有毒物质。
    造成黄河上游水质污染日趋严重的原因，一是黄河上游沿岸的一些厂矿企业没有采取防污措施，随便排放污水、废气、废渣；二是沿岸居民的生活垃圾管理不善，有的直接倒入河中。
