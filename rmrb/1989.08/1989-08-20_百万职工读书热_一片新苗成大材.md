Shanghai's "Revitalize China" reading activity began in 1982 and has now entered its seventh year. Numerous facts indicate that the reading activity initiated by the Shanghai General Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Liberation Daily, and the Shanghai People's Publishing House, among other departments and units, is also an effective form of ideological and political work in the new situation. It is an effective way to strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. During the reading boom of the previous few years, it is estimated that nearly a million workers in the city participated in various forms of reading activities, organizing nearly 80,000 reading groups, forming a network of reading activities.

The Shanghai Municipal Reading Guidance Committee recommends a batch of book lists each year. Participants in the reading activities read nearly 10 recommended books each year. Initially, the focus was on the "Three Histories" (History of Social Development, History of Modern China, and History of the Chinese Revolution). Later, the focus expanded to areas such as ideological cultivation, philosophy, political economics, and science and technology.

The reading fever has yielded abundant results, and many workers have established a correct outlook on life. Many young workers at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant initially had doubts about the superiority of the socialist system. The factory organized everyone to study the basic theories of Marxism and Leninism. Through study, they improved their understanding and became more firmly convinced of socialism. Young workers Hong and Chai became "instructors" for the reading activities among young workers. Taking the Metallurgical Bureau as an example, in recent years, 3,137 reading enthusiasts in this system have joined the Communist Party, 151 have joined the Communist Youth League, 2,051 have taken up leadership positions, 16,119 have become production backbones, and 844 backward youths have shown different degrees of improvement.

Reading has also made many workers into specialists. There are many examples of self-improvement through reading activities. They have published nearly a thousand articles in various newspapers and journals and have published nearly 20 monographs. Xu Qi, the head of the storage and transportation section of the Shanghai Department Store, is over fifty years old but still studies diligently. Combining his business practice, he has written and published a 300,000-word book titled "Packaging Engineering." Yue Lu of the Shanghai Huimin Battery Factory has read extensively in the field of enterprise management and has compiled books such as "Modern Management Handbook for Team Leaders" and "Concise Dictionary of Quality Management." Yu Guo, a worker at the Shanghai Watch Factory, has loved reading since childhood but lacked guidance. After participating in the reading activities, he shifted from general reading to specialized research, writing papers and books such as "On Special Talents—Geniuses" and "The Aurora of Talent."

The reading activity has received attention from central leaders. During 1984 and 1985, central leaders received representatives of reading activity enthusiasts multiple times, rapidly expanding the reading activity nationwide.

    百万职工读书热
    一片新苗成大材
    上海市的振兴中华读书活动始于1982年，至今已进入第七个年头。大量事实表明，由上海总工会、共青团上海市委、解放日报、上海人民出版社等部门和单位发起的读书活动，也是新形势下一种有效的思想政治工作，是加强社会主义精神文明建设的有效途径。在前几年读书高潮时期，估计全市有近百万职工参加了各种形式的读书活动，组织了近8万个读书小组，形成了读书活动的网络。
    上海市读书指导委员会每年推荐出一批书目，参加读书活动的人每年要读近10本推荐书。一开始，主要读“三史”（社会发展史、中国近代史、中国革命史），其后又向思想修养、哲学、政治经济学和科学技术等领域渗透。
    读书热成果累累，很多职工因此树立起正确的人生观。上钢三厂不少青年，起初对社会主义制度优越性存有疑虑，厂里就组织大家学习马列主义基础理论。通过学习提高了认识，更加坚定了社会主义信念，青工小洪、小柴还成了青工读书热的“辅导员”。以冶金局为例，这个系统的读书积极分子几年来就有3137人加入共产党，151人加入共青团，2051人走上领导岗位，16119人成为生产骨干，844名后进青年有了不同程度的转变。
    读书也使不少职工成了专门人才，读书活动中自学成才的不乏其例。他们在各种报刊上发表各类文章近千篇，出版了各种专著近20本。上海百货公司储运科仓务组长徐琦，年过半百，犹苦读不已，结合业务实际，缩写出版了30万字的《包装工程》一书，上海汇明电池厂岳鲁，大量攻读企业管理方面的书籍后，编写了《班组长实现现代管理手册》、《简明质量管理词典》等书。上海手表厂工人俞果，从小热爱读书，但苦于无人指导。参加读书活动后，他从泛泛而读转向专题研究，先后写出了《试论特殊人才——鬼才》、《人才的极光》等论文和书。
    读书活动受到中央领导的重视，在1984年、1985年期间，中央领导同志多次接见了读书活动积极分子的代表，使读书活动迅速向全国扩展。
