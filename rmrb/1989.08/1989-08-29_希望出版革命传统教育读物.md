In recent years, we have spoken less to young students about the glorious revolutionary traditions and the selfless spirit of heroes. According to a newspaper report, a significant number of primary and secondary school students do not know who Lei Feng, Dong Cunrui, or Huang Jiguang are.

This is undoubtedly an educational oversight and a matter of great regret and reflection.

Conducting revolutionary tradition education for young students, helping them love the Communist Party of China and the socialist motherland, is an important part of current school ideological and political work.

However, in carrying out this educational activity, we deeply feel the lack of revolutionary tradition education materials. When we try to organize students to read stories, diaries, and biographies of heroic figures, the school library has few such books, and the book market has very few suitable books for students to read, almost none at all.

Teachers often lament, “When conducting revolutionary tradition education, teachers have no textbooks, and students have no reading materials. They do not know who the heroes are or what they did. Teaching them with half-baked knowledge is really difficult!”

In stark contrast, the book market still has books and magazines with content involving murder, violence, and obscenity, spreading spiritual pollution.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that the publishing sector will quickly publish some revolutionary tradition education materials. At the same time, we also hope that the film and television sector will produce more films and television shows about revolutionary heroes and historical films about revolutionary struggles. If efforts are made in these areas, it will be more convenient for schools and society to better conduct revolutionary tradition education for young students.

### 希望出版革命传统教育读物

    希望出版革命传统教育读物
    近几年来，我们对青年学生讲光荣革命传统少了，讲英雄人物的献身精神少了。据一家报纸透露，有相当数量的中小学生对雷锋、董存瑞、黄继光为何人都一无所知。
    这不能不算是教育的失误，是令人非常痛心而又值得深思的。
    对青年学生进行革命传统教育，使他们热爱中国共产党和社会主义祖国，是当前学校思想政治工作的一项重要内容。
    可是，我们在进行这一教育活动中，深感革命传统教育的读物匮乏，想组织学生阅读英雄人物的故事、日记、生平，学校图书馆没有这类藏书，图书市场上适合学生阅读的这类图书所见无几，寥若晨星。
    教师们十分感慨地说：“对学生进行革命传统教育，教师无教材，学生无读物，对英雄人物不知其人，不明其事，搞一知半解的说教，实在难办！”
    与此形成鲜明对照的是，图书市场上仍不同程度地存在着一些有凶杀武打、淫秽内容的书刊，扩散精神污染。
    因此，我们恳切希望出版部门尽快出版一些革命传统教育的读物；同时，也希望影视部门多拍一些革命英雄人物的影视片和革命斗争题材的历史片。如果能在这些方面切切实实下功夫，就便于学校和社会更好地对青年学生进行革命传统教育。
