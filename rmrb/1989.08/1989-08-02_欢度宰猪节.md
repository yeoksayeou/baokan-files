On a winter afternoon, I, along with dozens of foreign journalists, braved the biting cold to visit the village of Strebá in eastern Slovakia, at the invitation of the villagers, to celebrate the Pig-Slaughtering Festival.

Strebá is nestled in the picturesque Tatras Mountains, surrounded by dense forests and snow-capped peaks. The village was blanketed in white, a pristine sight. As we stepped out of the car, several women dressed in vibrant traditional costumes approached us, offering bread and salt. This is the most formal way for villagers to welcome guests.

The hosts invited us to board the village's old-fashioned horse-drawn carriages, which took us directly to the pig-slaughtering ground. Three skilled butchers swiftly killed a large white pig weighing over a hundred kilograms. They then quickly scalded the pig in a large pot of boiling water, removed the innards, made blood sausages, and cooked the meat. Within an hour, the aroma of the roasting meat filled the air. Several elderly women of the village, who were highly respected, brought us steaming plates of pork and homemade grape wine to sample. I took a piece of the meat and put it in my mouth. Although the meat was quite fatty, it was not greasy, and the more I chewed, the more fragrant it became.

After enjoying the delicious food and wine, we headed to the village clubhouse to watch the villagers perform traditional dances. The people here are skilled in singing and dancing, and it is common for them to sing and dance spontaneously. During the dances, the women wore intricately embroidered dresses with white silk skirts, looking graceful and elegant. The men wore sleeveless vests and white pants, with feathered hats on their heads. The villagers first performed a celebratory dance. Men and women formed a circle, singing ancient tunes and dancing. The villagers also invited the guests to join in the dance. I am not good at dancing, and when a Slovak girl came up to me and invited me to dance, I immediately broke out in a sweat. As a guest, it is impolite to refuse, so I mustered up the courage to join in.

After the celebratory dance, the villagers performed the Shepherd's Dance, the Forest Fire Dance, and the Weaving Dance. These dances are based on folk legends and customs, full of the flavor of everyday life. The Shepherd's Dance was performed by several young men dressed in lambskins. Accompanied by beautiful music, they mimicked the playful antics of lambs and the lively jumps of mountain goats, perfectly imitating the movements of sheep, eliciting cheers from the audience.

The Weaving Dance is based on the historical life of local women, showcasing the hard work and wisdom of rural women. Two older women spun an ancient spinning wheel, singing weaving songs as the wheel hummed. A group of girls in colorful dresses, holding spindles, danced gracefully. The dance was simple and beautiful, vividly depicting the ancient national traditions and the hard work of women weaving.

The people of Strebá are warm and hospitable, frequently offering us cups of fragrant grape wine and various sweet snacks. Curious, I asked a Slovak friend about the origins of the Pig-Slaughtering Festival. He smiled and said, "This is an ancient custom. Usually at the end of the year or the beginning of the new year, the whole village gathers to slaughter pigs, drink wine, celebrate the harvest, and welcome the new year. Over time, the meaning has changed. Whenever there is a significant celebration in the village or when honored guests arrive, the villagers will slaughter a pig to entertain the guests, sharing the joy of meeting and the friendship."

Time flew by amidst the singing and dancing. As the sun began to set, we bid farewell to the villagers of Strebá. The warm-hearted villagers saw us off to the village outskirts and only left after our car had started. At that moment, I looked out of the car window towards the distance and was immediately captivated by the breathtaking scenery. The snow-covered mountains stood side by side, stretching endlessly. Wisps of white clouds lingered among the peaks. The setting sun seemed to roll in the colorful clouds, then sank into the layers of mountains. The afterglow of the setting sun bathed the mountains, making the Tatras even more vibrant and colorful.

    欢度宰猪节
    孙希有
    一个冬日的下午，我和数十名外国记者冒着隆冬凛冽的寒风，应邀来到捷东部边陲的斯特尔巴村，同村民一起欢度宰猪节。
    斯特尔巴村坐落在风光旖旎的塔特拉山间，四周为茂密的森林和皑皑的山峰所环绕。村庄银装素裹，一片洁白。我们一走下汽车，几位身着艳丽民族服装的妇女手捧面包和盐走到我们面前，请我们品尝。这是乡村欢迎客人最隆重的礼节。
    主人请我们坐上村中保留着的四个轱辘的老式马车，径直来到村中的宰猪场，观看宰猪的全过程。三位宰猪能手个个身材魁伟，十分麻利地将一头百多公斤重的大白猪杀死，然后在广场上架起的开水锅中迅速地将猪退毛，取出内脏，灌制雪肠，煮肉。约有一个多小时的光景，肉香便扑鼻而来。村中几位年长而又有威望的老婆婆端着热气腾腾的猪肉和村中自酿的葡萄酒来到我们面前，请大家品尝。我拿起一块肉放入口中，肉虽然很肥，但入口内并不觉腻，越嚼越香。
    饱尝美酒香肉，我们一行来到村中俱乐部大厅，观看村民表演民间舞。这里的人们能歌善舞，随唱随跳习以为常。跳舞时妇女们穿上自己精心绣制的图案新颖的花衣，腰系白色的纱裙，显得婀娜多姿。男子们身穿无袖夹衣和白色裤子，头上戴着一顶插着羽毛的毡帽。村民首先跳欢庆舞。男男女女环成一圈，边唱古老的曲子，边跳舞。村民们还邀请来宾共舞。我跳舞是外行，当一个斯洛伐克姑娘走到我跟前，邀我一起跳舞时，汗一下子从我脑门冒了出来。主人来请不能拒绝，否则会被认为不尊重主人，我只好硬着头皮跟着踢踏起来。
    欢庆舞后，村民们还表演了牧羊舞、森林灭火舞、纺织舞。这些舞蹈取材于民间传说和习俗，有着浓厚的生活气息。牧羊舞由几名披着羔皮的小伙子表演。他们在优美的音乐伴奏下，时而像羊羔儿相互戏耍，时而像淘气的山羊满山蹦跳，把羊的动作模仿得惟妙惟肖，激起人们阵阵喝采声。
    纺织舞是根据当地妇女的历史生活实践编排的，体现出农村妇女的勤劳和智慧。两位年长的妇女摇起了古老的纺车，在嗡嗡的纺纱声中唱起了织布歌。一群身穿艳丽服装的姑娘，手持纺梭，翩翩起舞。舞蹈朴实自然、优美，再现了古老的民族传统和妇女们辛勤纺织的情景。
    斯特尔巴村人热情好客，不时给我们送上一杯杯醇香的葡萄酒和各式各样的甜点心。我好奇地问一位斯洛伐克同志，宰猪节起源于什么时候，他笑着说，这是一个古老的习俗。一般在岁尾或年初，全村人聚在一起，宰猪喝酒，庆丰收，迎新春。后来逐渐改变了意思，每当村中有重大喜庆日子或尊贵的客人到来，人们就杀猪款待来宾，与客人共享相识的欢欣和友好的情谊。
    歌舞声中，时间过得飞快。当太阳要落山时，我们告别了斯特尔巴村。热情的村民把我们送到村外，直到汽车开动方才离去。这时我从车窗向远方眺望，立即被这里的奇丽景色迷住了。放眼望去，白雪皑皑的山峦相互偎倚、绵延不绝。缕缕白云在山峰中倘佯。夕阳似乎在彩霞中滚动，然后坠入层层叠叠的群山之中。落日的余辉洒满山间，使塔特拉山显得更加绚丽多彩。
