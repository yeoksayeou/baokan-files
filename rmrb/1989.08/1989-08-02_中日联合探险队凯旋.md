The Sino-Japanese Joint Expedition Team has completed all its exploration activities. Yesterday, the northern detachment, which crossed the Tian Shan Mountains and circled the Taklamakan Desert, arrived in Urumqi. The southern detachment, which conquered the Snow Lotus Peak, also successfully reached Turpan. Tomorrow, the two detachments will reunite in Urumqi.

The northern detachment, consisting of 9 Japanese and 10 Chinese members, set out from Xiatai on the northern foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains on July 1st, advancing towards the Tian Shan Mountains. They braved heavy rain, snow, and hail, forging ahead along treacherous mountain paths, and crossed more than 10 perilous rivers. Finally, they broke through the ice and crossed the mountain range, successfully crossing the Tian Shan Mountains on July 9th.

The southern detachment, consisting of 7 Japanese and 8 Chinese members, set out from Aksu by car on June 21st, heading north to reach Po Chengzi.

The Japanese members of the expedition team will rest and sightsee briefly in Urumqi before returning home via Beijing.

    中日联合探险队凯旋
    新华社乌鲁木齐8月2日电　（记者姜志武）中日联合探险队探险活动已全部结束。昨天，跨越天山山脉和环绕塔克拉玛干大沙漠的北路别动队安抵乌鲁木齐，征服雪莲峰的南路别动队也顺利到达吐鲁番。明天，这两路人马将在乌鲁木齐会师。
    由9名日本人和10名中国人组成的北路别动队，是7月1日由天山北麓的夏台出发，向天山山脉挺进的。他们冒着雨雪冰雹的疯狂袭击，沿着崎岖难行的山路前进，还涉过了10多条险恶的河流，最后又凿冰架索，奋力攀登，才于7月9日成功地翻过了天山山脉。
    由7名日本人和8名中国人组成的南路别动队，是6月21日由阿克苏乘车北上，抵达破城子的。
    这支探险队的日方人员将在乌鲁木齐作短暂休整和参观，然后经北京回国。
