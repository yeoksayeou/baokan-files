    Japan's New Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki

    On August 9, the new head of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kaifu Toshiki, was elected as Japan's 76th and 48th Prime Minister.

    The 58-year-old Kaifu is the first Prime Minister born in the Showa era. He hails from Aichi Prefecture and was born in Nagoya City in 1931 into a family that ran a photography studio. After graduating from middle school, he first enrolled in Chuo University and later transferred to Waseda University, where he was a member of the "Waseda Debate Society." In 1960, at the age of 29, he entered politics and became the youngest member of the Diet at the time. He has since been elected to the House of Representatives 10 times.

    Within the Liberal Democratic Party, Kaifu belongs to the Kawamoto faction (formerly the Miki faction) and serves as the representative convener of the Kawamoto faction. He has held various positions within the party, including Chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Committee on Cultural Affairs. During the Miki cabinet, he served as Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary. In the Fukuda cabinet and the second Nakasone cabinet, he served twice as Minister of Education. Politically, he admires the late former Prime Minister Miki Takeo and has received Miki's favor. In this election for the LDP presidency, he emphasized the importance of addressing political reform and political ethics issues. In foreign relations, he prioritizes Japan-U.S. relations, coordinates with Western Europe, and seeks to strengthen ties with neighboring Asian countries. Kaifu has visited China several times.

    Kaifu enjoys reading novels and appreciating art, and does not smoke or drink. His favorite motto is "A man without integrity stands for nothing." He is known for his eloquence and is one of the few skilled orators within the Liberal Democratic Party.

    日本新首相海部俊树
    8月9日，新任日本自民党总裁海部俊树被选为日本第76届、第48位首相。
    现年58岁的海部是日本第一位昭和年代出生的首相，爱知县人，1931年生于名古屋市一个照相馆之家。中学毕业后先考入中央大学，后转入早稻田大学，是早大“雄辩会”成员。1960年29岁时进入政界，是当时最年轻的国会议员，至今10次当选为众议员。
    海部在自民党内属河本派（前身是三木派），是河本派代表召集人，在党内先后任国会对策委员长、文教制度调查会长。三木内阁时期任内阁官房副长官，在福田内阁和第二次中曾根内阁中曾两次任文部相。政治信念方面他尊前首相三木武夫（已故）为师，颇受三木青睐。这次自民党总裁选举中，他表示把政治改革、政治伦理问题作为重要的解决课题；对外关系中要以日美关系为中心，协调西欧，增进与亚洲邻国的关系作为外交支柱，海部曾数次访问过中国。
    海部爱好读小说和美术鉴赏，不喜烟酒。喜欢的格言是“人无信不立”，他能言善辩，是自民党内屈指可数的雄辩家。
