The Navy Party Committee organized over 100 senior military leaders to study revolutionary theory in relation to their actual work, engage in deep reflection, and achieve noticeable improvements in their ideological and theoretical understanding.

These senior military leaders, building on their previous systematic study of revolutionary theory, began a 10-day intensive study session on August 5. They focused on the works and speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, as well as relevant documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. During the study period, the Navy Party Committee invited officials from the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Central Propaganda Department, and other relevant departments to provide briefings on the current international situation, China's domestic and foreign policies, and the manifestations of bourgeois liberalization. They also invited professors from the Central Party School and the National Defense University to provide theoretical guidance. Through diligent reading and study, and by linking theory to practice, these senior military leaders achieved a new level of ideological and theoretical understanding. They not only wrote over 100 study notes and reflection articles but also preliminarily summarized the lessons learned.

	• Senior cadres must lead in strengthening the study of Marxist theory to resist the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization. The participating senior military leaders summarized that party cadres at all levels must never relax their study of Marxist theory. They are determined to undertake a systematic review of the basic theories of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.

	• Senior cadres must lead in upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and withstand the "dual tests" of governance and reform and opening up. Everyone clearly sees that only by leading in upholding the Four Cardinal Principles can cadres become clear-headed Marxists and guide the modernization of the military in the correct direction. As leaders, they must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles without wavering; not deviate from the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee; not relax ideological and political work; and not lose the glorious traditions of the Party and the military.

	• Senior cadres must lead in gaining the trust of the people, maintaining integrity, and revitalizing Party discipline. The participating senior military leaders, in conjunction with the issue of clean governance, studied theory and reflected on their practices. They believe that senior cadres leading in maintaining integrity and revitalizing Party discipline is the best way to link theory with practice and reflect. Through their studies, the senior military leaders expressed their determination to start with themselves and begin now, gaining the trust of the people through practical actions, maintaining integrity, and revitalizing good Party discipline.

    带头学习  深刻反思  重振党风
    海军军以上干部学理论求共识
    据新华社北京8月15日电（记者黄彩虹）海军党委组织100多名军以上领导干部联系实际学习革命理论，深刻反思，从思想理论的提高上取得了明显效果。
    这些军以上领导干部在前一段系统学习革命理论的基础上，从8月5日开始集中10天时间，深入学习邓小平同志论坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的文献集和重要讲话，同时结合学习党的十三届四中全会有关文件。在学习中，海军党委邀请了国务院、外交部、中央宣传部等有关方面的负责同志分别介绍了当前国际形势和我国对内、对外政策，及资产阶级自由化的表现；还请中央党校和国防大学的教授作了理论辅导。通过认真读书学习，联系实际深刻反思，这些军以上领导干部在思想上理论上有了一个新的提高，不仅写出了100多篇读书笔记和体会文章，而且初步总结了应该记取的经验教训。
    ——高级干部要带头加强马克思主义理论学习，抵制资产阶级自由化思潮的侵蚀。参加学习的军以上领导干部总结出党的中高级干部任何时候都不能放松马克思主义理论学习这个深刻的教训，决心进行一次系统的马克思主义、毛泽东思想基本理论再学习。
    ——高级干部要带头坚持四项基本原则，经受执政和改革开放的“双重考验”。大家清醒地看到，领导干部只有带头坚持四项基本原则，才能做一个清醒的马克思主义者，指导部队现代化建设沿着正确的方向发展。作为领导干部应该做到：坚持四项基本原则动摇不得；执行党的十一届三中全会路线偏离不得；思想政治工作放松不得；我党我军的光荣传统丢失不得。
    ——高级干部要带头取信于民，廉洁奉公，重振党风。参加学习的军以上领导干部结合廉政建设问题，一边学理论，一边反思。大家认为，高级干部带头廉洁奉公，重振党风是最好的理论联系实际和反思。通过学习，军以上领导干部表示首先要从自己做起，从现在做起，以实际行动取信于民，廉洁奉公，重振好的党风。
