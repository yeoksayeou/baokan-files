After the storm, reflecting on the pain, we must seriously review the youth thought political work of recent years. The lessons and insights are profound and can be summarized as "six more, six less":

1. As peace and development gradually become the themes of the contemporary world, we have focused more on domestic peace and production and life, but we have analyzed and exposed less the sinister intentions of international capitalism in their "peaceful evolution" strategy against us.

2. When Western capitalist ideologies and various "theories" flood in, we have introduced them without proper discernment and criticism more often, but we have propagated and educated on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought less.

3. When Western countries show certain economic developments due to specific conditions, we have talked more about their supposed "strengths," but we have propagated and educated less on the unparalleled advantages of socialism.

4. When facing the rampant bourgeois liberalization trend and the urgent need to strengthen the Party's leadership, we have weakened the thought political work teams more, but we have taken concrete measures to strengthen them less.

5. When encountering certain temporary difficulties in reform and construction, we have talked more about the mistakes and problems in the work, but we have exposed less the malicious intentions of a few people who use these issues to drive a wedge between the Party and the people.

6. When it is urgent to inspire the whole nation to strive hard together to build the Four Modernizations, we have talked more about money, enjoyment, and demands, but we have propagated and educated less on ideals, dedication, and the principle of serving the people.

    风波之后的反思
    ——谈青年思想政治工作的“六多六少”
    风波之后，痛定思痛，对近年来青年思想政治工作进行认真反思，启示和教训是深刻的，可归纳为“六多六少”：
    一、当和平与发展逐渐成为当今世界的主题时，对国内和平的生产和生活看得多，对国际资本主义对我“和平演变”之心不死的卑劣用心分析揭露得少。
    二、当西方资本主义思潮和形形色色的“理论”一涌而进之时，对此不加鉴别和批判地介绍得多，对马列主义毛泽东思想的正面宣传教育少。
    三、当西方国家近年来依赖各种特定条件而使经济呈现某些发展之时，对它们的所谓“长处”说得多，而对社会主义无可比拟的优越性宣传教育得少。
    四、当面对资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，急需加强党的领导之时，思想政治工作队伍被削弱的多，真正采取切实措施予以加强的少。
    五、当改革和建设出现某些暂时困难之时，对工作中的某些失误和问题说得多，对少数别有用心的人以此离间党和人民关系的险恶用心揭露得少。
    六、当急需激励全国人民艰苦奋斗共建四化之时，对金钱、享乐、索取说得多，对理想、奉献、为人民服务的宗旨宣传教育得少。
