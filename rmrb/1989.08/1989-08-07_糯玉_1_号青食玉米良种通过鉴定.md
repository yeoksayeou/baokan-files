The "Niuyu 1" green eating corn variety bred by the Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Corn Research Institute recently passed expert identification in Jinan.

Waxy corn originated in China, with rich genetic resources, but low yields and few people cultivating it. Researchers used hybrid methods to breed "Niuyu 1," which not only has thin seed coats, fresh ears suitable for eating raw, and a sticky, fragrant taste, but also has high disease resistance and high yield. After trials in five counties and cities including Liangshan County, Shandong Province, the average yield per mu was 437.5 kilograms, a 24% increase over the control variety "Yan Dan 5." Experts believe this is currently the best variety of green eating corn in China.

    糯玉1号青食玉米良种通过鉴定
    新华社济南8月7日电  （记者尹建华）山东农科院玉米研究所选育出的“糯玉1号”青食玉米良种，日前在这里通过专家鉴定。
    糯玉米起源于我国，品种资源丰富，但产量很低，极少有人种植。科研人员采用杂交方法选育出的“糯玉1号”，不仅籽粒皮薄，鲜穗青食，粘香可口，而且抗病高产。经山东省梁山县等5个县市试种，平均亩产437.5公斤，比对照品种“烟单5号”增产24％。专家们认为，这是目前我国最适宜作青食玉米的优良品种。
