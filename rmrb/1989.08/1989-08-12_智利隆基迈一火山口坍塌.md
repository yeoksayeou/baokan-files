Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, August 11th.

The "Navidad" crater of the Lonquimay volcano, located 670 kilometers south of Santiago, the capital of Chile, collapsed on the 10th. Molten rock debris fell from the top of the 250-meter-high crater, destroying a quarter of it.

This 2,800-meter-high volcano, which had been dormant for a century, began erupting on December 25 last year. The "Navidad" crater on the northeastern slope of the volcano was gradually formed at that time.

From an airplane, one can see the large pit formed by the collapse of the crater's top. Due to the significant reduction in the size of the crater, magma flowed in all directions, and hot gases occasionally erupted, rising to a height of 2,000 meters. The Lonquimay Valley was shrouded in a thick smoke.

    智利隆基迈一火山口坍塌
    新华社圣地亚哥8月11日电　位于智利首都圣地亚哥以南670公里处的隆基迈火山“纳维达德”火山口10日坍塌。溶岩碎屑从高达250米的火山口顶部喷落下来，使四分之一的火山口遭到了破坏。
    这座海拔2800米的火山在沉睡了一个世纪后于去年12月25日开始喷发。位于火山东北坡的“纳维达德”火山口是在那个时候逐步形成的。
    从飞机上可以俯瞰到因火山口顶部倒塌而形成的大坑。由于火山口大大缩小，岩浆四处溢流，灼热的气体不时喷出，升腾到2000米高空，隆基迈山谷笼罩在一片浓烟之中。
