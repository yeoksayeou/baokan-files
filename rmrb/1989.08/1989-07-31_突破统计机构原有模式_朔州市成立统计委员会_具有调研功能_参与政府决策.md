Shanxi Province's first municipal-level statistical committee was recently established in Shuozhou City. This is the second such committee at the municipal level in the country, following Henan Province's Sanmenxia City.

Shuozhou City is the only city in China, excluding Hainan Province, that is conducting economic and political system reforms in the form of "small government, big society." As a think tank for the municipal government, the newly established statistical committee has made significant breakthroughs in its functions compared to the previous statistical bureau. It has merged with the municipal economic information center, operating under two names but with a single team. This integration ensures that the information center is built on a rich information resource base, making the management of information collection, processing, storage, transmission, analysis, release, and publication systematic and holistic. This will change the previous practice of "layer-by-layer reporting," giving the committee the function of policy research for the government. It will participate in the entire process of government macro-decision making through statistical surveys and economic analysis.

The Shuozhou City government has decided that in the future, the evaluation and assessment of the performance of various levels, departments, units, and their leaders will be entrusted to the statistical committee. Shuozhou City will also pioneer the implementation of statistical supervision and special envoy systems. In handling cases of violations of statistical regulations, there will not only be "yellow cards" but also "red cards." The statistical committee will regularly report to the People's Congress on the completion of national economic and social development plans and issue bulletins to the entire city, ensuring that the government truly has a comprehensive view and accurate information in its macro-decision making.

    突破统计机构原有模式
    朔州市成立统计委员会
    具有调研功能　参与政府决策
    本报太原7月31日电　山西省第一家地市级统计委员会，日前在朔州市成立。这是继河南省三门峡市之后全国第二个地市级统计委员会。
    朔州市是我国除海南省以外唯一的一个以“小政府，大社会”的形式进行经济体制改革和政治体制改革的试点城市。作为市政府的智囊团体，新成立的统计委员会较之原先的统计局在职能上有了重大突破。它与市经济信息中心融为一体，实行两块牌子，一套人马，从而使信息中心建立在丰富的信息资源基础上，使信息采集、处理、存贮、传递、分析、发布、出版的管理系统化、整体化。它将一改过去那种“层层报表”的工作程式，具有政府政策调研功能，用统计调查、经济分析参与政府宏观决策的整个过程。
    朔州市政府决定，今后将各级各部门、各单位及其领导人的政绩考核、评价权赋予统计委员会。朔州市还将率先实行统计监督、特派员制度，在查处违反统计法规的案件上，不仅有“黄牌”，而且还有“红牌”。统计委员会定期向人大报告国民经济和社会发展计划的完成情况，向全市发布公报，使政府在宏观决策上，真正做到“胸怀全局，心中有数”。　（康怀英）
