Shanghai's six scientific and technological armies have grown and strengthened over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, serving as a formidable force in overcoming challenges.

According to common perception, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and central government research institutions in Shanghai are referred to as the "mobile army," while higher education institutions and research bodies under various systems and departments are known as the "regular army." Research institutions established within factories and enterprises are called the "local troops," and the privately-run scientific and technological institutions set up during the reform of the scientific and technological system can be considered the "guerrilla forces." These six armies are striving and working hard within 622 independent research and development institutions.

They form a powerful contingent of natural science professionals, a force dedicated to scaling the heights of scientific and technological advancement. From the artificial synthesis of ribonucleic acid to the Long March 4 carrier rocket, from satellites exploring space to hand reconstruction technology and the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer, these achievements that have captivated the world are all the result of the wisdom and sweat of Shanghai's 426,000 scientific and technological personnel. In 1988, Shanghai achieved 2,062 major scientific and technological results, of which 446 reached the world's advanced level, accounting for 22% of the total scientific and technological achievements; 762 were first in the country, accounting for 37%.

These six scientific and technological armies, aiming for the nation's revitalization and Shanghai's development, have shifted their focus to the main battlefield of economic construction. Many research institutions have, to varying degrees, entered enterprises or enterprise groups. The "variable speed hydraulic coupler" developed by the 711 Research Institute, when applied in steel mills and cement plants, has saved the nation 160 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. The "machine-washable resin M trial and application" used in wool sweaters has reduced the area shrinkage rate to less than 1%, meeting the international standard for machine-washable products. The "upper induction brazing of oxygen-free copper" is widely used in electronic vacuum devices, ventilation cables, and high-temperature conductors, with its main performance reaching the current international advanced level. In the past two years, 420 scientific research achievements have been promoted, beginning to produce significant economic and social benefits. These scientific and technological achievements, with a total investment of 130 million yuan, have generated 1.009 billion yuan in new output value and 258 million yuan in new taxes. The investment in major scientific and technological breakthrough projects organized by Shanghai during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period has been fully recovered. On average, every 1 yuan of investment brings 7.37 yuan of output value and 1.6 yuan of taxes.

The scientific and technological armies have also shown unprecedented enthusiasm in participating in Shanghai's key industrial battle projects. When the Municipal Science and Technology Commission publicly tendered 136 key projects, 979 units and 1,638 individuals came to discuss, accept projects, and receive 8,676 project books, which is 6.8 times the number of key projects.

    六路科技大军争攀高峰
    上海六路科技大军，是建国40年来成长壮大的攻坚力量。
    按照人们习惯的形象的说法，中科院和中央在沪科研机构是“野战军”，高等院校和各系统各部门的科研机构是“正规军”，设在厂矿企业中的科研机构则是“地方部队”，在科技体制改革中建立起来的民办科技机构可谓“游击队”。这六路大军，分别在622个独立科研开发机构中奋发图强，辛勤劳动。
    他们是一支自然科学专业人员的强大部队，是攀登科学技术高峰的攻坚力量。从人工合成核糖核酸到长征四号运载火箭，从遨游太空的卫星到再造手技术、肝癌诊断与治疗，这些令世人瞩目的成就，无不凝聚着上海42.6万科技人员的智慧和汗水。在1988年上海取得的2062项重大科技成果中，达到世界先进水平的有446项，占科技成果总数的22％；国内首创的有762项，占37％。
    这六路科技大军为着国家的振兴，上海的发展，纷纷把攻坚的目标转向经济建设的主战场。一批科研机构不同程度地进入企业或企业集团。711研究所研制的“调速液力耦合器”，在钢铁厂、水泥厂应用后，为国家节电1.6亿度。“机可洗树脂M试制和应用”用于羊毛衫，其面积毡化收缩率下降至1％以下，达到国际规定的机可洗水平。“上引法无氧铜焊”广泛应用于电真空器件、通风电缆、耐高温导体等行业，主要性能达到了当代国际先进水平。近两年来组织推广的420项科研成果，开始产生显著的经济效益和社会效益。这批总投资为1.3亿元的科技成果，已新增产值10.09亿元，新增利税2.58亿元。上海在“六五”期间组织的重大科技攻关项目，所用投资已全部回收。平均每投资1元，带来7.37元的产值和1.6元的利税。
    科技大军参加上海市工业重点会战项目也表现了前所未有的热情。在市科委公开136项攻关项目招标时，有979个单位、1638人前往洽谈、承接项目、接受标书8676份，为攻关项目的6.8倍。
