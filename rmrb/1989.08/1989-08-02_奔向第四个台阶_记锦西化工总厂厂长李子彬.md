The story goes that five years ago, a joint working group from the Chemical Industry Department, Liaoning Province, and Jinzhou City, visited the Jinxi Chemical Plant to find a leader and a solution. They interviewed 40 people, but all the responses were disappointing.

This is understandable. The Jinxi Chemical Plant was established in 1939 and was an old factory with strong technical capabilities. After liberation, many new chemical products successfully developed by China were born here. The reason "Jinlon" (a type of synthetic fiber) is named with the character "Jin" is because it was successfully developed in the Jinxi Chemical Plant. However, in the early years, it became a "difficult case." The entire factory was filled with garbage, with 3,311 trucks of waste removed in one go; machinery was outdated, and leaks were everywhere. In the first half of 1984, the books showed a profit of 320,000 yuan, but in reality, it was a loss. Many experts and technicians were transferred to Dalian, Nanjing, and Shanghai, a phenomenon known as "The Peacocks Fly Eastward." Who would dare to take on such a mess!

At this time, Deputy Chief Engineer Li Zibin stepped forward. He told the working group members: The current situation facing Jinxi Chemical Plant is both a challenge and an opportunity. There are three reasons: First, this place was originally a national experimental factory with nearly a thousand engineers and more than 2,000 technicians. These years, they have been holding their breath, with some production projects in hand; second, there are many old workers with good technical skills and ideological qualities; third, chemical products are in demand, and if produced, they will sell well and make a profit. He analyzed: "Why are there thorns and weeds on this fertile land of chemicals? It is because the leaders have neglected cultivation." His insights refreshed the working group members. After a democratic election, in July 1984, Li Zibin became the plant director.

Li Zibin graduated from Tsinghua University and loves literature, philosophy, and history. He is down-to-earth but not short-sighted, has long-term plans but does not aim too high. His strategy is: Improve old products to ensure survival and develop new products to seek development.

Producing old products requires the efforts of all employees in the factory. He broke down the annual profit of 5.39 million yuan into workshops and put them out to bid. Regardless of which faction, those who can do it sign the contract and take office; those who cannot, regardless of who they are, should step down. According to the contract, this move worked, and by the end of the year, the profit was 5.83 million yuan, exceeding the plan.

Li Zibin said: The plant director is just a "red manager," only barely passing. He is not, he wants to be the "leading goose." In the past nine years, he has led all the employees of the factory to cross three steps—

He and the technical personnel conducted market research, analyzed domestic and foreign data, and found that epoxy propane polyether can be used for artificial leather, carpets, and insulation materials, with development prospects; polyvinyl chloride can be used for plastics, beverage bottles, food bags, syringes, and agricultural films, which are urgently needed domestically; bisphenol A, made into high-grade engineering plastics, is both corrosion-resistant and wear-resistant, but has always relied on imports. Therefore, Li Zibin, upon taking office, gathered the plans of the technical personnel for these production projects and began the development of new products. In 1986, the profit and tax revenue exceeded 20 million yuan, reaching the first step.

The production of engineering projects requires water and electricity to keep up. Li Zibin then started the construction of the second-level power station project and water supply project. Chemical production has many slags and ashes that are discarded, polluting the environment and costing money to transport out. They implemented comprehensive utilization, building a cement plant with an annual output of 60,000 tons, arranging surplus labor, and ensuring the supply of cement for construction, significantly improving economic benefits. In 1987, the profit and tax revenue reached more than 30 million yuan, reaching the second step.

Li Zibin learned that the offshore oil drilling team discovered a large amount of natural gas in Bohai Bay, which can be used to produce fertilizers. He immediately organized forces to investigate and verify, and reported to the leadership that building a large fertilizer plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea in their chemical plant, relying on existing technical strength, production equipment, and living facilities, would save more than 50 million yuan compared to building a new fertilizer plant. Thus, he won the project. In 1988, the profit and tax revenue reached 78.46 million yuan, reaching the third step.

Now, Li Zibin is leading the entire factory to stride towards the fourth step: expanding the production of Jinlon and caustic soda, and building new factories for caprolactam and ortho-dichlorobenzene. After the completion of these projects, the annual output value of Jinxi Chemical Plant will reach 2.3 billion yuan, with a tax and profit of 1 billion yuan. By then, they will enter the ranks of the world's leading chemical industries.

    奔向第四个台阶
    ——记锦西化工总厂厂长李子彬
    本报记者　段心强
    话说5年前，化工部、辽宁省、锦州市联合工作组，在锦西化工总厂换个儿找干部谈话，寻找治厂的人和办法。可一连找了40人，回答都令人失望。
    这也难怪。锦西化工总厂本是1939年建的老厂，技术力量雄厚。解放后中国自己试制成功的许多化工新产品都在这里诞生。“锦纶”之所以冠个“锦”字，就因为它是在锦西化工总厂试制成功的。可头几年却成为“老大难”。全厂垃圾成山，一次就拉出去3311车；机器老化，到处跑冒滴漏。1984年上半年，帐面上有32万元利润，实际上却是亏损。一些专家、技术员纷纷调往大连、南京、上海，人们称之为“孔雀东南飞”。就这样一个残局，谁还敢立军令状！
    这时，副总工程师李子彬站出来了。他对工作组的同志说：当前锦西化工厂所面临的，既是困境，也是机遇。理由有三：一、这里原是国家的试验厂，工程师近千名，技术员2000多人。这些年都憋着一口气，手中有一些生产项目；二、老工人多，技术水平和思想素质都比较好；三、化工产品走俏，能生产出来就畅销、赢利。他分析：“在这片化工的沃土上，为什么会长满荆棘和杂草？是领导者忽视了耕耘。”他的见解使工作组成员耳目一新，经过民主选举，1984年7月，李子彬当了厂长。
    李子彬毕业于清华大学，又热爱文学、哲学和历史。他脚踏实地又不只顾眼前，有长远规划又不好高骛远。他的策略是：搞好老产品以求生存，开发新产品以求发展。
    生产老产品要靠全厂职工。他把全年539万利润分解到车间，招标承包。不管哪一派的，能干的签上合同，上任；干不了的，不管什么人，请让出位子。按照承包合同办事，这一招真灵，年底获利583万元，超了计划。
    李子彬说：厂长仅仅是个“红管家”，只能算刚刚及格。他不是，要当“领头雁”，9年来，他率领全厂职工已跨越了三个台阶——
    他和科技人员一起，作市场调查，分析中外资料，了解到环氧丙烷聚醚可做人造革、地毯、保温材料，有发展前途；聚氯乙烯可做塑料、饮料瓶、食品袋、注射器、农膜，国内迫切需要；双酚A，作成高级工程塑料，既防腐，又耐磨，但一直靠进口过日子。因此，李子彬一上任便把科技人员对于这些生产项目的规划集中起来，开始新产品开发。1986年利税突破2000万元大关，上了第一个台阶。
    生产工程需要水、电跟上，李子彬又开始建设二级电站工程和供水工程。化工生产有许多渣和灰弃掉，既污染环境，又要花钱顾人往外拉送。他们搞综合利用，建成年产6万吨的水泥厂，既安排了剩余劳力，还保证了基建中的水泥供给，较大地提高了经济效益。1987年实现利税3000多万元，上了第二台阶。
    李子彬得知海上石油钻井队在渤海湾发现大量天然气，可以生产化肥，马上组织力量调查论证，向领导机关说明，在他们化工总厂建一个年产30万吨合成氨、52万吨尿素的大化肥厂，依靠现有的技术力量、生产设备，以及生活设施，要比新建一个同样的化肥厂节省5000多万元，因而争得了这个项目。1988年实现利税7846万元，上了第三个台阶。
    现在，李子彬正带领全厂向第四个台阶飞奔：扩大锦纶、烧碱产量，新建已内酰胺、对二氯苯分厂。这些项目完成后，锦西化工总厂年产值将达到23亿元，税利10亿元。到那时，他们就进入世界化工强林之中。
