	The first domestically produced fully enclosed high-power air-conditioned train in China departed from Changsha Station at 5:50 PM today, beginning its operation on the Jingguang Line between Changsha and Guangzhou.

	This train was designed by the Fourth Vehicle Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways and jointly manufactured by more than ten factories, including the Fourth Vehicle Factory and the Changchun Railway Vehicle Factory. The air-conditioning system has a maximum cooling capacity of 40,000 calories per hour, which means that under a high temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, the system can reduce the temperature inside the carriage to around 24 degrees Celsius within half an hour. Other technical indicators also surpass those of imported similar trains.

	The train is equipped with luxurious facilities and comfortable seats.

    首列全封闭空调列车运营
    本报长沙8月25日电　今天下午5点50分，我国第一列国产全封闭大功率空调列车从长沙车站徐徐开出，在京广线长沙—广州区段投入运营。
    这列车是由铁道部四方车辆研究所总体设计，四方车辆厂、长春客车厂等十几家工厂联合试制的。空调车的最大制冷量40千卡／小时，即在37摄氏度高温条件下运行，开机半小时，可使车厢内温度降到24摄氏度左右，其它各项技术指标也优于引进的同类车。
    这列车设备豪华，座位舒适。　（吴兴华　夏业斌）
