    Black Dragon River Wheat Can Be Increased

    According to Xinhua News Agency in Harbin on August 2, this year, Heilongjiang Province's 25 million mu of spring wheat has achieved a bumper harvest. Relevant departments predict that the total output can reach 3 billion to 3.25 billion kilograms, an increase of more than 500 million kilograms compared to last year.

    Heilongjiang Province encountered severe drought during the wheat sowing period this year, but during the jointing and grain-filling stages, the rainfall was abundant, resulting in wheat that is generally thick-stalked, large-ear, and full-grained. The main reason for Heilongjiang's wheat increase this year is that the state appropriately raised the wheat price, coupled with the education of farmers in various places to consider the overall situation, resulting in an increase of 6.67 million mu in sowing area compared to last year.

    黑龙江小麦可增产
    据新华社哈尔滨8月2日电　（记者张广远）黑龙江省今年2500万亩春小麦喜获丰收。有关部门预测，总产量可达30亿至32.5亿公斤，比去年增产5亿公斤以上。
    黑龙江今年小麦播种时遇到了严重干旱，但进入拔节、灌浆期雨量充沛，小麦普遍秆粗、穗大、籽粒饱满。黑龙江今年小麦增产，主要由于国家适当提高了小麦价格，加上各地对农民进行了顾大局的教育，播种面积比去年增加667万亩。
