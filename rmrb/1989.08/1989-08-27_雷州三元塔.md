The Three Pagodas of Leizhou

The line “登临几度生秋兴，咫尺身依日月光” (Deng lin ji du sheng qiu xing, zhi chi shen yi ri yue guang) was written by Chen Shan, a jinshi (advanced scholar) from Haikang, Leizhou, during the early Qing Dynasty, as he toured the Three Pagodas.

The Three Pagodas, located southeast of Haikang County in the Leizhou Peninsula, is a famous brick pagoda in Guangdong Province. Originally named the Qixiu Pagoda, it signified “promoting literary talent and producing scholars in succession.” Later, during the excavation of the foundation, three snake eggs were unearthed, which was interpreted as an omen of “achieving the top three positions in the imperial examinations.” Hence, it was renamed the Three Pagodas.

According to historical records, during the Tang Dynasty, there was a temple called Kaiyuan Temple here, with a stone pagoda beside it. By the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty, the temple had fallen into ruin and the pagoda had been destroyed. At that time, Eu Yangbao, the magistrate of Leizhou Prefecture, rebuilt the current brick pagoda on the original site of the stone pagoda.

The Three Pagodas stands nine stories high, in an octagonal shape, and is 57 meters tall. From a structural and design perspective, it is built with angular bricks and linear bricks layered in an interlocking manner to form eaves, giving it a majestic and elegant appearance. The base is larger than the top, with each layer gradually tapering inward.

At the base of the pagoda, there is a large stone platform with intricate carvings on all eight sides. These carvings include depictions of auspicious scenes such as mythical creatures, lions playing with balls, dragons and tigers fighting, rabbits and lingzhi mushrooms, phoenixes facing the sun, and monkeys picking peaches. The lines are bold and the figures are lifelike, making it a precious example of Ming Dynasty stone carving art with local characteristics. Now, after restoration, the Three Pagodas stands even more magnificently, attracting many domestic and international tourists. Standing at the top and leaning on the railing to gaze out, one can take in all the scenic beauty of Leizhou.

    雷州三元塔

    “登临几度生秋兴，咫尺身依日月光”。这是清初雷州海康进士陈瑸在游览三元塔时写下的诗句。
    三元塔，位于雷州半岛海康县城之东南，是广东省著名的砖塔。它初名启秀塔，意即“启发文风，人才辈出”。后在挖地基之时，挖出蛇卵三个，即认为这是“三元及第”之兆，因此，改称为“三元塔”。
    据史志载：唐朝时这里建有开元寺，寺旁有座石塔，至明代万历年间寺废塔毁，当时雷州府推官欧阳保乃在原石塔遗址上重建现在这一砖塔。
    三元塔，分九层，呈八边形，高57米。从造型和结构上看，它是以棱角牙子砖和线砖互相叠涩出檐，显得冠盖嵯峨，重叠雅观。塔下大上小，逐层递减收分。
    塔的底层，筑有很大的石刻须弥座，八面皆有精美的浮雕石刻，如麟趾呈祥、狮子戏球、龙争虎斗、玉兔灵芝、双凤朝阳以及猴子摘桃等，线条粗犷，神态栩栩如生，乃是具有地方风格的明代石刻艺术珍品。现在，三元塔经过整修，更加英姿焕发，矗立雷州，吸引了许多海内外游人。登临极顶，倚栏眺望，则雷州胜景，尽收眼底。
