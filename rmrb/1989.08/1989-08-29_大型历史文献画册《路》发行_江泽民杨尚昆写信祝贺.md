Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 29th. (Reporter Li Guangru) The extraordinary journey of the Chinese revolution is vividly depicted in the large historical documentary album "The Road." The first issue ceremony of this album was held today at the Great Hall of the People.

"The Road" is a collection of works by the renowned Chinese photographers Xu Xiaobing and Hou Bo, a married couple. For the publication of this large album, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin and Chairman of the State Yang Shangkun wrote letters of congratulation.

Comrade Jiang Zemin wrote in his letter: "The album truthfully records the arduous journey of the older generation of Chinese Communists in establishing and building New China. It is also a vivid textbook for educating and inspiring the entire nation, especially the younger generation, to strive for the revitalization of China and the realization of the Four Modernizations." Comrade Yang Shangkun wrote in his letter: "It is beneficial for helping people understand the arduous journey of the Chinese revolution and for helping people recognize the image and character of Chinese Communists. At the same time, it will surely inspire the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle."

Both Xu Xiaobing and Hou Bo grew up drinking the waters of the Yanhe River. Over half a century, they have immersed themselves in the fiery life, capturing the most rich and moving scenes, especially successfully recreating the appearance and demeanor of the older generation of revolutionaries. The book selects 188 photographs, arranged in chronological order from 1937 to 1966, divided into four parts: Yan'an, Taihang, Beijing, and New China.

Today, the 70-year-old Xu Xiaobing appeared very excited. He said: "My wife and I will use all the royalties to purchase 100 copies of the album, to be given to the capital's martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers." Zhou Ketyu, Li Lianxiu, and Mou Xinsheng accepted the gifts on behalf of the soldiers and officers.

Huang Zhen, Wang Fang, Kang Keqing, Yang Chengwu, Wang Renzhi, Ai Zhisheng, Mu Qing, Xue Ju, Wu Shaozu, Song Mumu, Wang Guangmei, and Ye Zilong, as well as some well-known figures from the capital's literary and artistic circles, attended today's first issue ceremony. The meeting was presided over by Li Qi, Director of the Central Committee's Documentation Research Office.

    据新华社北京8月29日电  （记者李光茹）中国革命不平凡的历程，在大型历史文献《路》中得到再现。这本画册的首发仪式今天在人民大会堂举行。
    《路》是我国著名摄影家徐肖冰、侯波夫妇的作品选集。为这本大型画册的面世，中共中央总书记江泽民、国家主席杨尚昆写了贺信。
    江泽民同志在信中说：“画册真实地记录了老一代中国共产党人为创建和建设新中国所走过的艰苦历程，也是今天教育和激励全国人民尤其是年轻一代为振兴中华、实现四化而奋斗的生动教材”。杨尚昆同志信中写道：“它有益于帮助人们去了解中国革命的艰巨历程，有益于帮助人们去认识中国共产党人的形象和品格。同时，也必将激励人民解放军指战员继承和发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。”
    徐肖冰、侯波都是喝延河水长大的。半个世纪以来，他们投身火热的生活，获取了最丰富、最动人的场景，尤其是成功地再现了老一辈革命家的音容笑貌。书中选用了188幅照片，按1937—1966年的时间顺序，分为延安、太行、北平和新中国四个部分。
    年过70的徐肖冰今天显得很激动。他说：“我们老两口用全部稿费购得100本画册，分别送给首都戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警。”周克玉、李连秀、牟新生代表指战员接受了他们的馈赠。
