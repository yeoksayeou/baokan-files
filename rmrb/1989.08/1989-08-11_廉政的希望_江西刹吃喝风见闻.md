One billion yuan, a shocking figure. In the years when the banquet culture was rampant, the party and government agencies in Jiangxi Province spent approximately one billion yuan annually on banquets.

Now, Jiangxi has successfully curbed the persistent banquet culture, and people see a glimmer of hope for clean governance.

This hope lies not only in the significant reduction of extravagant banquets but also in the firm resolve and determination demonstrated by the Party and government in this special battle:

Scene 1: On June 5, 12 leaders from the provincial and municipal discipline inspection commissions of Jiangxi visited Wannian County for an opening ceremony. They were rare guests in this remote county town, but during their meal at the county guesthouse, each person had only one dish and one bowl of soup in front of them.

Scene 2: “A few yuan, just let it go if the manager isn't around. Comrade Zhang, let's hurry and get in the car.” A leader from Qingtang Town urged. “No, we must pay the meal fee according to the regulations.” Ningdu County Party Secretary Zhang Shengwei insisted on paying.

Scene 3: Member of the Central Advisory Commission Rao Shoukun, accompanied by Shangrao Municipal Secretary Shao De, visited Wuyuan County. The county used the individual meal system to host him. The old man smiled and said, “This is good, this is good!”

These scenes occurred after the implementation of Jiangxi Province's regulations to curb the banquet culture on June 5, in the old revolutionary base areas that had suffered greatly from the “banquet plague.”

In May this year, Jiangxi Province, after thorough research and extensive consultation, formulated the “Provisional Regulations on Resolutely Curbing the Banquet Culture.” Before June 5, the “regulations” were published in full in newspapers and radio stations at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, and were posted in various hotels and guesthouses, making them public.

People praised this “regulation” for being genuine and strict, with clear differences from previous ones:

	•	In the past, Jiangxi's regulations to curb the banquet culture were often vague and difficult to implement. They often resulted in “top-down policies, bottom-up countermeasures”; when “four dishes and one soup” were mandated, the response was “four bowls and one vat”; when canned drinks were banned, larger bottles were used instead. Moreover, there were countless excuses for hosting banquets, such as welcoming new leaders with the excuse of it being the first time, or entertaining old leaders with the excuse of past support. This time, the province clearly specified the form, quantity, and quality of meals. For example, “implement the individual meal system, with one dish and one bowl of soup per person, with no more than three types of ingredients in the dish, at least one of which must be a vegetarian dish.” Expensive dishes like sea cucumber, turtles, crabs, shrimp, shark fins, and fish maws were specifically banned. It was also emphasized that no welcome or farewell banquets should be held, and no one should dine with any excuse.

	•	In the past, the banquet culture could not be curbed because of mutual observation and competition, with the belief that “whoever does not host a banquet loses out.” This time, the “regulation” required that starting from June 5, the entire province would uniformly implement the individual meal system, with no exceptions. For example, for enterprises, the regulation stated, “Economic activities between enterprises in the province should also follow the regulations to implement the individual meal system or purchase tickets for meals.” For meetings, the regulation stated, “Promote the individual meal system. For those that need to dine together, only four dishes and one soup are allowed, with no expensive dishes, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, fruits, or drinks.”

	•	The penalties in the “regulation” are very strict and specific. For example, “reimbursement of banquet expenses to participants,” and fines equivalent to the amount of the meal for both the host and the guest. “Those who violate the regulations four times (i.e., four meals) will be demoted or removed from their posts depending on the severity of the offense,” and for accounting personnel who provide reimbursements, “20% of their monthly salary and all bonuses for that month will be deducted, and those who violate the regulations four times will be removed from their positions and transferred from financial positions.” For supervisory departments, “if no action is taken within half a month after receiving a report, it will be considered dereliction of duty or malfeasance.”

	“If one's conduct is upright, orders are followed without command; if one's conduct is not upright, even with orders, they are not followed.” Jiangxi's crackdown on the banquet culture starts from the top, demonstrating an unprecedented resolve. In early July, Party and government leaders such as Provincial Party Secretary Mao Zhiyong and Governor Wu Guanzheng went to the countryside to inspect flood damage, leading by example in implementing the individual meal system and voluntarily paying for their meals. No unit in various places used cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, fruits, or drinks to entertain them. On July 6, Mao Zhiyong, after finishing dinner at the New Yu City Party Committee guesthouse, the reception staff brought three small slices of watermelon to his room. Mao Zhiyong initially refused to accept them, but later paid two jiao for each slice. After that, the reception staff no longer dared to give the secretary “special treatment.”

	From June 13 to 17, Deputy Director Wang Binfa of the Cultural and Educational Bureau of Yingshan District, Yingtan City, and his team, during an inspection of dangerous school buildings in the district, accepted school banquets, eating seven meals, six of which included cigarettes and alcohol, spending 292.69 yuan of public funds, and were reported by the masses. Wang Binfa was quickly given an administrative demerit, fined, and publicly criticized.

	According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months, the province has handled more than 20 cases of violations of disciplinary regulations regarding banquets, and more than 100 “banquet officials” have been fined, with two receiving disciplinary and administrative penalties.

	The reporter has a document showing the changes in the crackdown on the banquet culture in Ningdu County, a revolutionary base in Jiangnan, compared to the same period last year: last June, the county's reception expenses were 221,000 yuan, while this June, they were 54,000 yuan, a 75% reduction.

	At the same time, the reception expenses of party and government agencies have been significantly reduced. In the past year, 22 township units in Yushui District, New Yu City, spent no less than 400,000 yuan on receptions, but now, following the regulations, 300,000 yuan is enough for a year. In the past, Changkai Town in Lingchuan City was often bustling with cars and guests, with 6,000 bottles of beer consumed in one summer, and up to 17 tables set up in one day. In 1988, the town government alone spent 870,000 yuan on receptions. After the implementation of the regulations to curb the banquet culture, the number of guests here has significantly decreased, and it is estimated that 200,000 yuan in reception expenses can be saved annually. According to the relevant departments of the province, based on the situations reported by various places, the reduction in reception expenses of party and government agencies in the province is around 80%. If this continues, the province can save 80 million yuan in expenses annually.

	“No oil in the stomach, go to the countryside for a walk; no taste in the mouth, go to a meeting.” This was a rhyme that Jiangxi people used to mock “banquet officials.” Now, seeing the new situation of the crackdown on the banquet culture in Jiangxi, the people are all in high spirits, and someone has composed a new rhyme: “Corruption has a cure, the key is to be genuine, curb the banquet culture, and promote clean governance and a strong nation.”

    廉政的希望
    ——江西刹吃喝风见闻
    新华社记者  杨健  徐金鹏
    一亿元，一个惊人的数字。在吃喝风肆虐的岁月，江西省党政机关每年约有一亿元资金在觥筹交错中化为乌有。
    现在，江西刹住了屡禁不止的吃喝风，人们从中看到了廉政的希望。
    这希望不仅在于疯狂的吃喝风已大大收敛，更在于党和政府在这场特殊战斗中表现出的坚定决心和意志：
    镜头之一：6月5日，江西省省、地纪委12名领导干部来到万年县开片会。他们是这座偏远县城的稀客，但是，在县招待所用餐时，摆在每个人面前的都是一盘菜、一碗汤。
    镜头之二：“块把钱，管理员不在就算了。张书记，快上车吧。”青塘镇一位领导干部催促着。“不行！按规定必须交伙食费。”宁都县委书记张声炜硬要交款。
    镜头之三：中顾委委员饶守坤在上饶地区行署专员邵德陪同下来到婺源县，县里以分餐制接待他。老人笑呵呵地说：“这样好，这样好！”
    这是自6月5日江西省刹吃喝风规定生效之后，出现在饱受“风灾”之害的老区几个生动场面。
    今年5月，江西省经过认真研究和广泛征求意见，制订了《关于坚决刹住吃喝风的试行规定》。6月5日前，“规定”在省、地、县各级报纸、电台全文刊播，并在各宾馆、招待所张贴，公之于众。
    人们盛赞这个“规定”动真格的，动硬的，具有不同以往的明显特点：
    ——江西过去刹吃喝风的规定大都笼统含糊，操作较难。往往造成“上有政策，下有对策”；明令实行“四菜一汤”，下面就搞“四盆一缸”，禁上易拉罐，就上容量更大的宝特瓶。而且各种请吃的借口五花八门，如新领导干部来，说是第一次，下不为例；老领导干部来，又说过去对我们支持大，一杯薄酒，不成敬意。这次省里明确规定了用餐的形式、数量和质量。如“实行分餐制，一律一盘菜一碗汤，盘里的菜不得超过三个品种，至少要有一个素菜。”名贵菜肴逐一点名禁止上，如海参、甲鱼、螃蟹、对虾、鱼翅、鱼肚等。并强调不准搞“接风”“送别”宴会，“不准任何人以任何借口陪餐。”
    ——过去吃喝风刹不住，一个重要原因是相互观望、攀比，认为“谁不请吃谁吃亏。”这次“规定”要求从6月5日起全省上下一律执行分餐制，无一例外。如对企业的规定是“本省企业间的经济活动亦按规定实行分餐制，或购票就餐。”对会议的规定是“提倡实行分餐制。需要集中用餐的，只准四菜一汤，不准上名贵菜肴和烟酒、饮料、水果。”
    ——“规定”中的处罚措施十分严格具体。如“宴请费用向参加就餐者分别追还”，同时对宴请者、吃请者“处以相当补交餐费数额的罚款。”“违反四次（即四餐）者按情节轻重给予降职或撤职处分”，对给予报账的财会人员“扣发当月工资的20％和当月全部奖金，违反四次者，撤销职务，调离财务工作岗位”，监督部门
  “接到举报后半个月内不进行查处，按失职渎职论处。” 
    “其身正，不令而行，其身不正，虽令不从。”江西刹吃喝风从上做起，表现了前所未有的决心。7月上旬，省委书记毛致用、省长吴官正等党政领导干部分头下乡考察洪涝灾情，带头执行分餐制，主动交纳用餐费，各地也没有一个单位用烟酒、饮料和水果招待他们。7月6日，毛致用在新余市委招待所用毕晚餐后，接待人员将三小片西瓜送到他的住处。毛致用开始坚决不收，后来按每片两角钱付了款。以后，接待人员再也不敢给书记“特殊照顾”了。
    6月13日至17日，鹰潭市月湖区文教局副局长王斌发一行，在检查区内中小学校舍危房时，接受学校宴请，连吃七餐，其中六餐备有烟酒，花费公款292.69元，被群众举报。王斌发很快受到行政记过和罚款、通报处分。
    据不完全统计，近两个月来，全省已查处20多起违纪吃喝行为，100多名“吃喝干部”受到罚款处理，两人受到党纪政纪处分。
    记者手头有一份材料，表明赣南老区宁都县刹吃喝风一个月与去年同期对比的变化：去年6月全县招待费22.1万元，今年6月5.4万元，招待费下降75％。
    与此同时，党政机关的吃喝招待费用大大减少。新余市渝水区22个乡镇单位过去一年招待费不少于40万元，现在按规定办，一年3万元就够了。临川市的唱凯镇过去经常是车水马龙，宾客如云，一个夏天要喝掉6000瓶啤酒，最多一天摆17桌。1988年仅镇机关就花去招待费8.7万元，刹吃喝风规定实行后，这里食客大减，预计一年可节约招待费20万元。据省有关部门根据各地报来的情况估算，全省党政机关招待费下降幅度在80％上下。照此下去，全省一年可节约8000万元的开支。
    “肚里没有油，下乡走一走，口中没有味，出去开个会。”这是江西群众过去为讽刺“吃喝”干部编的顺口溜。如今，群众看到江西刹吃喝风出现的新气象，无不心情舒畅，有人又编了一首顺口溜：“腐败有药治，贵在动真格，刹住吃喝风，廉政又强国。”
