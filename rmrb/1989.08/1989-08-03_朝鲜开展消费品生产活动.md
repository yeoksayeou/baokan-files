North Korea has launched the "August 3rd People's Consumer Goods" production activities across the country to increase the supply of consumer goods in the market and meet the daily needs of the people.

The "August 3rd People's Consumer Goods" production activities began in August 1984. The main purpose of this production activity is to mobilize various local and organizational efforts to produce daily consumer goods, utilizing waste materials, by-products, and leftover materials to produce consumer goods needed for residents' daily lives.

Over the past five years, various regions in North Korea have established tens of thousands of workshops, work teams, and auxiliary teams specifically for the production of "August 3rd People's Consumer Goods." The number of people engaged in this work has reached several hundred thousand. Currently, the production units of "August 3rd People's Consumer Goods" have increased the variety of consumer goods to over 50,000, accounting for 9.5% of the sales volume of state-run commercial outlets.

The capital, Pyongyang, is at the forefront of the "August 3rd People's Consumer Goods" production activities nationwide. The city has established more than 1,200 new consumer goods production units using waste materials on the basis of the existing "family work teams." The variety of consumer goods produced has increased to 29,000. The production value and sales volume have both increased by 1.8 times compared to five years ago. Each district within the city has established specialized commercial networks and commercial service teams to organize and sell products from "family work teams" and other units.

    朝鲜开展消费品生产活动
    据新华社平壤8月3日电  （记者张锦芳）朝鲜各地开展“8月3日人民消费品”生产活动，增加市场消费品的供应，满足人民日常生活的需要。
    “8月3日人民消费品”生产活动是1984年8月3日开始进行的。这项生产活动的主旨是动员各地和各单位对生产日用消费品的积极性，利用废旧材料、副产品和下脚料，生产居民日常生活所需的消费品。
    5年来，朝鲜各地相继建立了几万个专门从事“8月3日人民消费品”生产的车间、作业班和副业班等生产实体，这类从业人员达几十万人。目前，“8月3日人民消费品”生产单位生产的消费品品种增加到5万多种，销售额占国营商业网点销售额的9.5％。
    首都平壤在“8月3日人民消费品”生产中走在全国前列。全市在原有的“家庭作业班”的基础上，新组建了1200多个以废旧材料为原料的消费品生产单位，增加生产消费品2.9万种。产值和销售额比5年前各增加了1.8倍。市内各区建立了专门的商业网和商业服务队伍，组织和销售“家庭作业班”等单位的产品。
