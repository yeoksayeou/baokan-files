Traditional fire extinguishers, while effective, have an unsightly appearance. Placing them on the plain walls of exhibition halls, hotels, and conference venues is far from aesthetically pleasing.

An American inventor has designed a frame-style fire extinguisher. At first glance, it looks like an ordinary picture frame, but it is thicker and has a layer at the bottom containing high-efficiency fire-extinguishing materials. When in use, open the valve and nozzle on one side of the frame, and it functions like a regular fire extinguisher.

Normally, this fire extinguisher hangs on the wall like a picture frame, with a painting or photograph in front, thus serving a decorative purpose as well.

    画框式灭火机
    传统灭火机虽然灭火性能良好，但外形不美，置于展览馆、宾馆、会场的粉墙上实在不够雅观。
    美国一位发明家设计了一种画框式灭火机——粗看与一般画框并无两样，但较厚实，内底夹层中放有高效灭火材料，使用时打开框架一侧的阀门和喷嘴，即可像普通灭火机一样灭火。
    平时，这种灭火机像画框一样高悬于粉墙上，前边装有图画、照片，因而颇富装饰作用。                林静
