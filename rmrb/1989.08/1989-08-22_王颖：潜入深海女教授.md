	Professor Wang Ying: The Woman Professor Who Ventured into the Deep Sea

	When the celebratory cannon shots of the founding of New China echoed, Professor Wang Ying was a 14-year-old girl, and the sea was merely a mirage in her dreams. At 17, she stepped into the classrooms of the Department of Geomorphology at Nanjing University's Geography Department. From then on, her footprints could be found along the coastlines of our motherland.

	In 1981, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in eastern Canada, as a visiting scholar from Nanjing University, 46-year-old Wang Ying, with her extraordinary courage, dove alone into the 216-meter-deep sea to conduct a two-hour survey of the underwater canyon, becoming the first Chinese scientist to venture into the deep sea for research. This feat astonished even international marine geologists.

	She loves the sea, but she loves her country even more. The following year, Wang Ying declined repeated invitations from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Canada and returned to her school as scheduled. Over the years, she has published more than 20 papers domestically and internationally. Her book "Atlas of Quartz Sand Surface Structures" has been praised by experts from China and abroad as a model reference. Last year, her name was included in the World's 5000 Notable People by the American Bibliographic Institute.

    王颖：潜入深海女教授
    当新中国成立的礼炮声奏响的时候，王颖教授还是个14岁的姑娘，大海也只是她梦中的幻影。17岁时她走进了南京大学地理系地貌学专业的课堂。从此，祖国海岸线上，处处留下了她的足迹。
    1981年，在加拿大东部的圣劳伦斯湾，作为南大的访问学者，46岁的王颖以其非凡的勇气，只身潜入216米深的海底，进行了两个小时的海底峡谷考察，成为我国第一位潜入深海考察的科学家。这一壮举，连国际海洋地质学家也为之吃惊。
    她爱大海，更爱祖国。翌年，王颖谢绝了加拿大贝德福海洋研究所的一再挽留，按期回到学校。几年来，她先后在国内外发表20多篇论文，她的《石英砂表面结构图集》一书，被中外专家誉为典范资料文献。去年，她的名字被美国文献研究所载入世界5000名人录。
