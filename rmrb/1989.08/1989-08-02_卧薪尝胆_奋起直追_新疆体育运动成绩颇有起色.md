Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 1st - Recently, at the 48th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Congress, the chairman of the Autonomous Region Sports Commission, Ke Yumu Ba Wudong, reported on the new developments in the region's sports work, in response to the inquiries and criticisms from last year's People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members.

At the end of 1987, at the Sixth National Games held in Guangdong Province, Xinjiang did not win any gold medals, and the team's overall ranking dropped from 20th place in the previous session to 26th place. This incident caused a strong reaction among all ethnic groups and sectors in the region. In early 1988, at the first session of the Seventh People's Congress and the first session of the Sixth CPPCC in the region, the People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members raised questions and made suggestions to the regional government regarding the problems in Xinjiang's sports work.

The regional government made serious arrangements and plans to quickly change the backward situation of sports work. At the same time, it promptly adjusted the leadership of the Sports Commission and strengthened the leadership of sports work. The government's leadership visited the sports departments several times to investigate, study, formulate measures, and help solve specific difficulties. Last year, despite financial difficulties, special funds were allocated to build training venues and facilities, creating better conditions for athletes' training. Meanwhile, political and ideological work was further strengthened, the management system was reformed, and specific measures for the management and training of excellent teams were promulgated and formulated, thereby inspiring athletes and coaches of all ethnic groups to endure hardships, train diligently, and fight a comeback battle.

After more than a year of efforts, Xinjiang's sports achievements have shown an upward trend. In 1988, in national-level official competitions, Xinjiang won 14 gold medals, 7 silver medals, and 17 bronze medals, with 89 individuals finishing in the top 8. In the first half of this year, in the National Speed Skating Championships, 5 gold medals and 3 silver medals were won. In bilateral and multilateral international friendly competitions with athletes from the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries, 5 individuals broke 4 national records and won 10 first-place finishes, bringing honor to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    卧薪尝胆　奋起直追
    新疆体育运动成绩颇有起色
    新华社乌鲁木齐8月1日电　（通讯员楼望皓）最近，在新疆维吾尔自治区人大常委会召开的第48次主任会议上，自治区体委主任克尤木·巴吾东汇报了自治区体育工作出现的新起色，以回答去年人大代表的质询和政协委员的批评。
    1987年底，在广东省举行的第六届全国运动会上，新疆未获得金牌，团体总分名次由上届的第20位下降到第26位。这件事在全疆各族各界引起了强烈反响。1988年初，在自治区召开的七届人大一次会议和六届政协一次会议上，人大代表和政协委员对新疆体育工作的问题，向自治区人民政府提出了质询和批评建议。
    自治区人民政府对迅速改变体育工作落后状况做出认真部署和安排。同时，及时调整了体委的领导班子，加强了对体育工作的领导。政府的领导多次深入体育部门，调查研究，制定措施，帮助解决具体困难。去年在财政十分困难的情况下，拨出专款，修建训练场、馆，为改善运动员的训练创造了条件。与此同时，进一步加强了政治思想工作，改革了管理体制，颁布和制定了优秀运动队的管理和训练工作的具体措施，从而激发了各族运动员、教练员卧薪尝胆，刻苦训练，打好翻身仗的决心。
    经过一年多的努力，新疆体育运动成绩出现了上升趋势。1988年在全国性的正式比赛中，新疆已获得金牌14枚、银牌7枚、铜牌17枚，并有89人次获得前8名。今年上半年在全国速滑锦标赛上，又夺得5枚金牌，3枚银牌。在与苏联、波兰等国运动员举行的双边、多边国际友谊比赛中，有5人打破4项全国纪录，夺得10个第一名，为新疆各族人民争得了荣誉。
