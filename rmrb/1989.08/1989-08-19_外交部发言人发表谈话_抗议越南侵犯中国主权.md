	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Issues Statement Protesting Vietnamese Infringement of Chinese Sovereignty

	New China News Agency, Beijing, August 19 - The spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry today issued a statement protesting Vietnamese infringement of Chinese sovereignty.

	The spokesperson said that recently, the Vietnamese authorities decided to establish a science and technology economic comprehensive zone in the offshore continental shelf reef areas of the Hoang Sa (Paracel) Islands and Truong Sa (Spratly) Islands. According to this decision, some buildings are to be constructed on parts of the islands and reefs of the Spratly Islands. This is a blatant infringement of China's territorial sovereignty.

	He said: "It is well known that the Spratly Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and China has indisputable sovereignty over these islands and their surrounding waters. The aforementioned decision by the Vietnamese authorities is illegal and invalid."

    外交部发言人发表谈话
    抗议越南侵犯中国主权
    新华社北京8月19日电　中国外交部发言人今天发表谈话，抗议越南侵犯中国主权。
    发言人说，最近，越南当局决定，在头顿——昆仑岛特区的沿海大陆架暗礁地区建立一个科技、经济综合区。按照这一决定，有些建筑物竟然要建在中国南沙群岛的部分岛礁上。这是对中国领土主权的粗暴侵犯。
    他说：“众所周知，南沙群岛自古以来就是中国的领土，中国对该群岛及其附近水域拥有无可争辩的主权。越南当局的上述决定是非法的、无效的。”
