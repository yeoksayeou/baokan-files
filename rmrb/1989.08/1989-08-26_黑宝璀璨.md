The vastness of the Yulin desert is like this: the sky is boundless, the land stretches endlessly, and the sand dunes, large and small, rise and fall in layers upon layers, growing endlessly in desolation. It's like an abandoned tattered mat, ignored by all; like a colorless, expressionless face, its reputation is left to chance. Walking for hundreds of miles, you might come across a village with only two or three households, each with sand bushes as tall as a person growing in front of their doors. Trees are also present, some thin and weak, others old and twisted in strange shapes: the trunks split into three or four parts, then twisted a few times, hollowed out, and then opened up in all directions, like a silent explosion of a landmine buried a hundred years ago. It is said that there are fields around the village, but these fields are like the footprints of an explorer on the moon, even a telescope can't find them.

Walking and walking, suddenly there is yellow soil, rocks, mountains, and lively towns, but all of this flashes by in an instant and is swallowed up by desolation again. A river called the Kuye River rolls in from the horizon, wild as its name, like a howling wolf, adding more desolation to this world. The water is the color of mud, the banks are the color of mud, and the riverbed is also the color of mud. The riverbed is vast and expansive, walking along it, the area is measured in tens of thousands of acres, but there isn't a single furrow, not even a blade of grass to be seen. Along the road, there are occasionally ancient ruins and remnants of walls on the hillsides, and sometimes a few rusted spearheads can be dug up from the riverbed, making one's ears ring with the faint sound of the ancient flute.

Whether it's the Yulin desert or the banks of the Kuye River, there are many strange place names: Bahaicaidang, Erlin Tu, Huoji Tu, Boluo, Huangtu Gai, Hala Gou, Xihulu Su... The place names match the scenery, and the scenery matches the place names, like the lyrics and melody of a song. The only things that don't match are the outsiders. Outsiders might be famous singers, or they might have stirred up a "Northwest Wind" that swept the nation, but they can't sing this song.

Looking at the scenery before you and listening to the place names, you might feel like you've arrived at some distant exotic land, but reason reminds you that you haven't left the borders of Shaanbei. However, you have indeed traveled a long way, and you are very close to the southern part of Mongolia. So, who gave these place names? Were they given by the Han people? By the Mongols? Or were they given by the Mongols and then transliterated by the Han people? No one can say for sure. What can be said for sure is that Han culture and Mongol culture have blended together here. The folk songs here are called "Shan Ge" (Mountain Songs), which is the name for Shaanbei folk songs; they are also called "Climbing Songs," which is the name for Inner Mongolian folk songs; and there is another name that simply combines the two, called "Mongol-Han Tune."

Just as insects can bring a bit of color to a prison cell, the people who have lived here generation after generation have brought life to this desolate land, with the sounds of roosters crowing and dogs barking, and the lively, fiery, and cheerful atmosphere. They plow and hoe on the slopes, build roads on the cliffs, and when they rest, they often wrestle: men wrestle with men, women wrestle with women, and sometimes, when the mood strikes, women wrestle with men. When someone gets married, the suona horns blow, and the bridal sedan chair flashes by, blowing a golden whirlwind and flashing into a phantom fireball, with seven or eight dishes and bowls on the table, drinking and guessing riddles, shouting and laughing, making a ruckus until the sky and earth are dark.

The land where the wind of freedom blows is here; the carefree and vibrant souls are here; countless Wang Gui and countless Li Xiangxiang are here. Here, men and women are equal, as equal as poetry, as songs, as paintings. Taking cooking as an example, women naturally have to cook, but men can't just come back from the fields and lie down on the kang, waiting for the food to be served; men also have to help. The men's cooking skills are so proficient that outsiders are amazed: they use both hands and feet, chopping buckwheat on the stove with one hand while stuffing firewood into the stove with their bare feet, and in no time, a family's meal is ready.

Although the harsh natural environment has tempered people's optimistic character, poverty is an unavoidable fact of life. Poverty is like the mysterious "Mao Gui" (Hairy Demon) in the legends here, impossible to kick away or beat off, always clinging and not letting go of people. Some families have five or six people sharing one quilt; some people can only eat a bowl of yellow millet porridge on New Year's Day. There is a folk song that goes: "Women dig bitter vegetables, men go to the border." If this summary of the ancestors' miserable days is still a bit bland, then the vast wilderness where bitter vegetables are dug, the road to the border, and the Mongol-Han tunes that echo through the wilderness and the road, are enough to make even the hardest hearts crumble.

Is this vast land really so poor?

For thousands of years, and even for a long time after the founding of New China, no one had ever asked this question.

But this land seemed to have had enough, finally revealing something to us.

In 1954, an official from the Yulin Prefecture, driven by a strong sense of responsibility, rode a donkey to Shuide (at that time, there was no road between Yulin and Shuide), and then took a car from Shuide to Xi'an, panting and breathless, reporting to the relevant departments of the province: "There is coal in Shenmu, a lot of coal, and the coal is self-igniting!" He also requested that the province quickly send people to extinguish the fire and quickly develop the coal!

But what he saw was a look of disdain: "We know, we know. The coal in your place, the province is fully aware, there is a bit, but it lacks industrial value."

The heart of that prefecture official, and the hearts of the poor people on this vast land, like the desolate land, also fell silent.

Is this vast land really so poor?

After that, no one would ask such a question. If someone still asked, wouldn't that be deliberately causing trouble? Besides, we have too many questions to ask, and they are questions burning with the flames of anger: questions about "rightists," questions about Peng Dehuai, questions about Liu Shaoqi; who has the time to ask such strange questions!

The 1950s passed, the 1960s passed, and the 1970s also passed. By the early 1980s, an old cadre from Shenmu working in a central government agency, a reporter, and then another reporter, finally picked up the question mark on this land and turned it into a heavy bomb-like exclamation mark, throwing it in front of the world: "There is a coal sea in Shaanbei, high quality and easy to mine!" After several years of hard exploration, the result was that wherever you drill, there is coal, and it is high-quality coal and gasification coal that is rare in the world!

People finally discovered that this Shaanbei, this Yulin region of Shenmu and Fugu, this vast land, is a land of unparalleled richness!

And in fact, its richness had long since leaped out in black, had long since shouted in black, it's just that we didn't pay attention for a long time, and we are ashamed of it.

Isn't it true? If we just delve a little deeper here, the problem would be completely clear.

No matter which road you take, if you just turn your head, whether in the desert, in the ditches, or in the rock layers, on these vast patches of mud-like color, your eyes will touch the shocking black, the exposed coal seams. Their thickness ranges from one to two meters, some even up to four meters. The animals, carts, and tractors you encounter on the road are mostly carrying coal. On the road with a little snow, white, yellow, and black are mixed together, white is snow, yellow is soil and sand, black is coal, in a dazzling display of colors, like a beautiful carpet of infinite length. Locals say that historically, there have always been many small coal mines here. In the 1930s, the first to rebel were a group of "coal miners," who formed the "Red Seventh Brigade" and bravely fought the enemy, achieving many victories. The reason for this is that they were at the bottom of society. "From a distance, they look like beggars, up close, they are coal miners." This local saying reveals the miserable lives of coal miners. The coal they dug was not valuable, their income was meager, just a little better than beggars, and they rarely washed their faces, even if they did, they would immediately turn black again, so they often returned home looking like black people. It is said that someone, during the New Year, washed his face clean and returned home, but his children didn't recognize him, crying and hiding in their mother's arms. In fact, such things happened a lot, because there were many small coal mines.

In the numerous large and small rivers, it is difficult to find stones, but it is easy to find coal lumps, which are everywhere. Some coal lumps have been rolling in the river water for many years, completely smooth and round, just like pebbles. And in some river sections, the entire riverbed is black, completely made of intact coal seams, standing in front of it is like facing a great night, seeing the night's movement, the night's black clothes fluttering. But the water is often muddy, and there is a lot of sediment at the bottom, so this strange scene is rarely seen. But no matter which riverbed you come to, as long as you dig away the top two meters of mud and sand, it is an open-pit mine. People affectionately call it "small open-pit." There are as many "small open-pits" as there are black lambs here.

Some river sections do not have ready-made coal, and the locals are too lazy to go far to carry it, just waiting for the river water to bring it. When a mountain flood suddenly surges, the waves carry the coal, the coal rolls with the waves, the waves roar and the coal roars, as if calling out to every household: "Coal, it's here, take it!" People are naturally happy, shouting and calling, men and women yelling, rushing from the hills, from the gullies, from every road, all heading to the riverbed. Only to see the coal lumps in the flood, like watermelons, like pigs and sheep, like cows, like millstones, like houses, and even like black giant wheels, rolling majestically from the surging waves. No matter who it is, as long as they have the strength, they can enjoy picking it up. Our country has had several waves of buying frenzies, buying color TVs, refrigerators, and even coal. For coal, here it is neither buying nor snatching, the coal flows endlessly, no need to queue, no need to push and shove, everyone can take what they need in harmony, and everyone is happy. One year, a particularly large coal lump, no, a coal mountain, was washed to the edge of a village, and the entire village of more than 20 households used pickaxes to break it up and shared it, burning it for three or four years, and some people still haven't burned it all.

Walking into some mountain villages, it's as if you've entered a black castle, surprising everyone. The walls are made of coal, the pigpens are made of coal, and even the toilets are made of coal. Whoever builds a new house, the foundation of the new house is a square and solid coal block. The village-run primary school is short of funds, so the students sit on coal, and use coal to support a wooden board as a desk. If the roadside collapses, use coal to fill it; if the embankment collapses, use coal to repair it. Coal is everywhere in life and production. Some mountain villages, however, do not have a single piece of coal, and you might think this place is short of coal, but that's a big mistake, it's because there is too much coal here, too close at hand, within reach, not bothering to store it by your side. Often, when it's time to cook, the adults, while taking out the matches, will tell the children: "Go pick up a few coal lumps." The children walk a few steps, turn a corner, dig a couple of shovels, and that's it. The coal here has a very low ignition point and is easy to burn, a couple of yellow weeds can be used as kindling.

The harsh northwest wind in winter is not a problem because there is plenty of cheap coal. Whether it's government agencies or ordinary people, they are all surrounded by coal; whether it's the host or the guest, they don't mind the trouble and burn as much as they want. There are no frozen corpses here, but there are people who have been burned. It is common to see people burning the kang mat or the quilt, and sometimes even burning themselves. People burn large blocks of coal, weighing dozens or hundreds of kilograms. The coal dust that is generally seen in other places is never touched here; it's not an exaggeration to say that even if you give it away, no one wants it. There was a story in Shenmu County: the coal company had a mountain of coal dust that they couldn't handle, and the company leaders were worried about what to do, fortunately, the power plant agreed to take it, so they quickly let them come and take it every day. In this way, the power plant generated electricity for three years without spending a penny on fuel, and the coal company was still grateful to them for cleaning up their garbage. The real black humor is here, not abroad.

During the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival, in addition to lighting lanterns like other places, they also light fire towers. Fire towers are made of coal and are usually one or two meters high. When the fire towers are lit, from the city to the countryside, in every street and alley, in every hill and valley, in front of every household, there is a brilliant and bright scene. Government agencies naturally have a bigger scale, and some build a fire tower that uses up three full truckloads of coal. Such a large and magnificent fire tower burns all night, and the next day, the sky is still blue, the clouds are still white, and there is not much garbage left, each coal tower turns into a layer of snow-like ash. This shows how excellent the quality of the coal here is. Scientific identification shows that it is low in ash, sulfur, and phosphorus, and the gas content is almost zero.

There is a tributary of the Kuye River called the Wulanmulun River. Driving along the Wulanmulun River, looking ahead, the mountains are covered with blooming flowers, like a red dawn, all glowing with a faint red light. It's like a burning mountain. Up close, the layers of rocks are like blood-soaked, like hot coals, still emitting a scorching heat. These are burning coal fields. It is said that in some places, the upper layer has burned, but the lower layer is still intact, while in some places, it has burned from top to bottom for tens of miles, leaving no coal behind. For millions of years, for thousands of years, generation after generation, month after month, how much has been burned? Even with computers and fast calculation methods, it's hard to calculate. And some are still burning today, with wisps of smoke coming out of the mountain cracks. Ask the coal field: "When were you formed?" The coal field said, using words that the locals find very unfamiliar, like something dug out of the Qin Emperor's tomb or fished out of the Pacific Ocean. It said it was the "Jurassic Period." The "Jurassic Period" is 140 million years ago. Millions of years of longing, millions of years of waiting, millions of years of expectation, how can it not burn like madness!

But we have finally become close to it, and we can see its beautiful face, like a black peony, more clearly. Half of its face is here, in the Shenmu and Fugu areas, called the Shenfu Coal Field; half of its face is in the southern part of Inner Mongolia, in the Dongsheng area, called the Dongsheng Coal Field. The two coal fields together are called the Shenfu Dongsheng Coal Field, truly a vast coal sea. More importantly, there is a sea under the sea, a sea under the sea, a sea under the sea, a total of five seas. The total reserves are equivalent to 165 times that of Fushun, and it can be said to be unparalleled in the world, ranking first among the world's eight largest coal fields. No wonder some foreign visitors, while praising it, jokingly said that they were a bit jealous of this. Oh, our ancient continent, our land that has experienced great disasters like our nation, how can it not hide such rich hopes!

The news spread, and the entire earth trembled. More than ten countries, including the United States, Japan, France, and England, felt it and expressed great interest in investing. The people on this land needless to say, were all like they had been injected with new life, running around telling each other: "We used to say we only have white treasure (wool), now we have black treasure too!"

Summoned by the dazzling black treasure, the modern coal mining teams walked into the ancient desolate land. In Dagoutai, 38 people came first, known as the "38th Army," and then 129 people, known as the "129th Division." What a proud coal mining army! In the desert, in the river channels, in the gullies, the magnificent scene of coal mining unfolded, like a world-class performance. One river separates the two sides, the west is Shaanxi, the east is Inner Mongolia, and both sides are working hard. Because of the coal mines, some small towns that once had fewer than 30 households have now increased to three or four million; some farmers who never sold anything before are now carrying baskets of eggs. Restaurants, inns, photo studios, department stores, bathhouses... sprang up like bamboo shoots after a rain, presenting a prosperous scene.

Walk to one place: mine. Walk to another place: mine. Those mines are mostly dug into the roots of the mountains, creating horizontal and inclined shafts. Horizontal shafts are horizontal snakes, inclined shafts are inclined snakes, towering mountains press down on them, and they open their mouths wide, spitting, spitting, spitting out endless coal. And the large open-pit mines present another magnificent scene. Coal seams tens of meters thick, like flawless black jade, without a single rock. It is a cliff of pure coal, a precipice of pure coal, a high-rise building of pure coal. People say that this pure coal can be used for gasification, and the coal powder can be sprayed with water, burning like gas. And this coal is so abundant. The sky and earth almost close, it is coal that pushes them far apart. Standing on top of the coal and shouting, you have to listen carefully to hear, and the voice is dyed black. Looking at this deep coal seam, you can't help but exclaim in amazement, you can't help but be overjoyed at the richness of this land. This is a magnificent Chinese painting, only Chinese ink and brush can paint it. When painting, how heavy is the brush, how rich and thick is the ink, even if it takes 800 years, it is hard to estimate. The iron machinery is roaring. It seems a bit dejected. It asks: "With so much coal, when will it be mined?" The mine director laughs and answers: "Just this mine, it won't take many days, maybe 200 years." It seems that the entire Shenfu Coal Field will be enough for us to mine with peace of mind. This coal field has been listed as a key national construction project during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," and the focus of coal production in China will shift from the east to the west. May a strong desert wind carry this news to every corner of the motherland!

Legs walk here, eyes see here, everywhere is a rich scene. The desolation, desolation, desolation that was once in the impression will forever say goodbye to this place. Shenfu high-quality coal is exported in large quantities, already earning a lot of foreign exchange. The train's whistle has been ringing here. Hope is at hand. However, the coal seams here do not contain rocks, but the development of the coal field contains worries. People painfully see that such a precious resource is being rushed: the state mines, the province mines, the region mines, the county mines, the township mines, the village mines, the collective mines, the individual mines, and even people from unknown places mine. The crowd is dense, pushing and shoving, surging, mining, digging holes, and rushing to grab. Many people just dig where they see quick profits. The topsoil and rubble are piled up in disorder. Halfway through the digging, they just throw it away. In a few years, many sections of this coal field have been dug to the point of being disfigured, covered in scars, and broken beyond recognition. Fortunately, this serious situation of reckless resource destruction has attracted the attention of relevant departments and has improved somewhat. However, people must say that more powerful measures must be taken to completely stop it. After all, damaging this coal field is damaging the black pupils of our beloved motherland!

    黑宝璀璨
    刘成章
    要知榆林大漠模样，这就是了：苍苍天无边，茫茫野无沿，沙丘大大小小、起起伏伏、重重迭迭，疯长着无涯的荒寂。像一领被扔弃的破席，没人再去理会；像一张无血色又永无表情的脸，毁誉由之。走上百八十里，偶见一村庄，只两三户人家，门前都长着一人高的沙蒿；树也是有的，或细弱，或老而奇形怪状：树干分裂为三四，又扭了几扭，又空了心子，又向四方龇开，如百年前埋下的一颗地雷作无声的爆炸。据说村庄周围也有田园，但这田园就像探险者踩在月球上的几片脚印，连天文望远镜也觅不出它在什么地方。
    走着走着，忽而有了黄土，有了石头，有了山，有了鲜活的城镇，然而这一切只晃了一瞬，又被荒寂吞没了。一条叫做窟野河的大河从天边滚滚流来，野得就像它的名字，就像一只嗥叫着的狼，给这天地间又增添了几分荒寂。水是泥浆的颜色，岸是泥浆的颜色，河滩也是泥浆的颜色。河滩宽阔博大，一路走上去，面积以万亩计，十万亩计，可惜没有一分田垄，甚至连一棵草茎也看不到。路边山梁上偶有古塞残堞，河滩有时也能掘出几块生了锈的戟铁，使人耳畔依稀啸过胡笳的悲鸣。
    无论榆林大漠还是这窟野河两岸，都有许多奇特的地名：巴虾采当、尔林兔、活鸡兔、波罗、黄土?垓、哈拉沟、西胡芦素……地名与风物相配套，风物与地名相和谐，有如一首歌子的词和曲。不配套不和谐的，只是远方来客。远方来客也许是著名歌星，也许扇起过风靡全国的“西北风”，却唱不了这首歌子。
    看眼前风物，听耳边地名，从感觉上，以为走到什么遥远的异域了，而理智却提醒你，还没出陕北的边界。不过确已走了很远很远，不过确已离蒙南高原很近了。那么，这些地名是什么人起的呢？是汉人起的？是蒙人起的？抑或是蒙人起下汉人又音译如此？谁也说不清楚。可以说清楚的是，汉文化与蒙文化，已在这儿交融在一起。这儿的民歌既叫“信天游”，是陕北民歌的名称；也叫“爬山歌”，是内蒙民歌的名称；还有一种叫法是干脆把二者化于一舌，就叫“蒙汉调”了。
    如同虫子也能教牢房产生点灵动色彩，世世代代繁衍在这里的人们，也使这一片死寂的土地，有了活气，有了鸡叫狗吠声，有了激激扬扬的红火热闹。他们耕锄于山坡，修路于崖畔，歇息时，往往就摔跤：汉子和汉子摔，婆姨和婆姨摔，有时兴致来了，婆姨和汉子也摔。逢上谁家娶媳妇，唢呐便吹，花轿便闪，吹出金黄的旋风，闪成虚幻的火球，还要七碟子八碗端上桌，猜拳，豪饮，喧嚣不住，欢笑不住，闹它个昏天黑地。
    吹荡着自由之风的乐土，在这里；洒脱蓬勃的灵魂，在这里；无数王贵无数李香香，在这里。在这里，男女好平等，平等如诗，如歌，如画。以做饭为例，婆姨固然得做，汉子也不能下地回来就往炕上一躺，只等着端来张口；汉子也得帮一手。汉子做饭功夫的熟练老到，常使外地人为之叹服：上下开弓，手脚并用，手在锅台上剁荞面，赤脚片子往灶膛里填柴禾，不一会，一家人饭就做好了。
      尽管严酷的自然环境磨练出人们的乐观性格，然而生活的贫困，确是无法回避的事实。贫
  困就像这儿传说的神秘的“毛鬼神”，踢不开，打不走，老是纠纠缠缠的不肯放开人们。有的人，一家五六口伙盖一块被子；有的人，大年初一只能吃上一顿黄米捞饭。有一首民谣是这么说的：“女人掏苦菜，男人走口外。”如果说，这种对人们祖祖辈辈凄惶日子的概括，还有些平淡的话，那么，那掏苦菜的旷野，那走口外的路上，那旷
  野和路上一声一声催人泪下的蒙汉调，却是令铁石心肠也会变得不堪一击的。
    这一片辽阔的土地，果真是那么贫困？
    千百年来，甚至在新中国建立后的好长一段时间里，谁也没有这么问过。
    但这块土地却似乎耐不住了，终于向我们泄漏了点什么。
    1954年，榆林专署的一个干部，出于高度的责任感，骑骡子跑到绥德（那时榆林和绥德之间还不通车），又从绥德搭车奔赴西安，气喘嘘嘘地向省上有关部门报告：神木有煤，煤很多，煤都自燃了！他还吁请省上，赶快派人灭火，赶快派人开发！
    然而看到的却是不屑一顾的脸色：“知道了，知道了。你们那儿的煤，省上完全了解，有是有那么一点，可是缺乏工业价值。”
    那个专署干部的心，那一片辽阔土地上穷苦老百姓的心，如同那片死寂的土地，也死寂了。
    这一片辽阔的土地，果真是那么贫困么？
    从那以后，更没有人会这么问了。如果还要这么问，那不是存心打岔么？何况，我们需要问的问题太多了，而且是燃烧着愤怒火焰的厉声质问：质问“右派分子”，质问彭德怀，质问刘少奇；谁有闲谈工夫发那样的邪问呢！
    五十年代过去，六十年代过去，七十年代也过去了。到了八十年代初，一位在中央机关工作的神木籍老干部，一位记者，接着又有一位记者，终于先后在这片土地上捡起问号，又把这问号铸为重型炸弹一般的惊叹号，抛掷在世人面前：陕北有煤海，优质易开采！随后经过几年的艰苦勘探，结果是，钻钻下去都有煤，而且是世界上少有的优质煤和气化煤！
    人们终于发现，原来，这陕北，这榆林地区的神木、府谷一带，这一片辽阔的土地，是一片富饶绝伦的土地！
    而其实，这儿的富饶，早已作黑色的跃出，早已作黑色的呐喊，怨只怨我们在相当长的年月里，心思没有用到正当地方，愧对它了。
    难道不是么，只要我们稍稍在这儿深入一下，问题就完全清楚了。
    不管沿着哪条道路走，偶一转脸，或于荒沙中，或于沟壕里，或于岩层间，在这些看着令人疲倦的泥浆般的大片底色上，你的目光便会触到惊心的黑，触到裸露的煤层。其厚度有的一米半米，有的两米三米，有的竟有四米之多。路上遇见的牲口、架子车、拖拉机，多是运的煤。落小雪的路上，白、黄、黑三色相杂，白的是雪，黄的是土，是沙，黑的是煤，斑斑驳驳，色彩对比鲜明，如铺着一条其长无比的美丽地毯。当地群众讲，历史上，这儿的小煤窑一直很多。30年代最先揭竿而起的，就是一伙“炭毛子”，他们组成了“红七支队”，奋勇杀敌，屡建奇功。之所以如此，是由于他们处于社会的最底层。“远看像个要饭的，近看是个掏炭的。”这儿流传的这个顺口溜，道出了掏炭人一直过着可怜日子。他们掏下的炭很不值钱，收入微薄，仅比乞丐强一点，绝少洗脸，即使洗了也立刻黑了，所以每每回家都像黑人一般。传说有人过年时洗净脸走回家来，孩子反倒认不得他了，吓得哇哇直哭，直往妈妈怀里钻。其实这类事情多的是，因为小煤窑很多。
    在大大小小的无数河流里，找石头难，找煤疙瘩易，煤疙瘩俯拾即是。有的煤疙瘩不知在河水中滚荡了多少年了，竟无棱无角，浑圆光滑，完全像卵石一样。而在有些河段，整个河槽竟都是黑的，黑黑然，彻头彻尾由完整的煤层构成，站到跟前如临大夜，看到了夜的走，夜的行，夜的黑衣飘动。但水多是浑的，水下又多沉淀着泥沙，这样的奇景很少得以一窥。但不管来到哪片河床上，只要把表面一层两米厚的泥沙挖走，便是一个露天矿。人们把它亲切地称为“小露天”。“小露天”多如这儿的黑羊羔。
    一些河段没有现成的煤，河边群众也懒得去远处搬运，只等河水送来。等到山洪一暴发，浪卷着煤，煤掀着浪，浪啸煤吼，似唤村村户户人：“煤，送到了，收下吧！”人们自是高兴，便大呼小叫，男喊女嚷，从山峁上，从背沟里，从条条路上，一齐涌向河滩。只见那洪流中的煤疙瘩，若西瓜，若猪羊，若牛，若碾盘，若房子，甚而至于若黑色的巨轮，从滚滚的波涛中威武驶来。不管是张是李，只要有力气，就尽兴去捞。我国曾几次掀起抢购风，抢购彩电，抢购冰箱，也抢购过煤。对于煤，这儿既不是购，也不用抢，煤之流源源不断，用不着排队，用不着挤挤搡搡，可以一团和气，各取所需，皆大欢喜。那一年，有块其大惊人的煤块，不，煤山，被冲到一个村子的地头，全村20多户人家用钢钎打碎分了，烧了三四年，有些人至今还没有烧完。
    走到一些山村，恍若踏入黑色的城堡，使人惊诧不已。院墙是煤砌的，猪圈是煤砌的，厕所也是煤砌的。不知谁家盖新房，那新房的基础就是四方四正的煤块子。村办小学经费困难，学生娃娃就坐在煤上，而用煤支起一条木板，就是桌子了。路畔塌了，用煤填；堤堰垮了，用煤补。煤，充斥在生活和生产的各个方面。也有些山村却不见一块煤，你以为这儿是缺煤的了，然而大谬，那反是因为这儿煤太多，煤太近，扬手可得，不必碍事绊脚地在身边储存。往往要烧火了，大人一边取火柴，一边才对孩子说：“拾几疙瘩炭去”。孩子随便走几步，随便转个山疙瘩，随便挖两镢头就是。这儿的煤燃点极低，烧着也不费事，一棵两棵黄蒿用来引火，便行。
    冬季的西北风虽硬，因为煤多煤贱，冷却是不怕的。不论是机关单位还是普通百姓，都是煤天煤地；无论是主家还是客人，不怕麻烦尽管烧。这儿没有冻死鬼，烧死鬼却是有的。常见一些人不是把炕席烧着了，就是把被子烧着了，有的连人也被烧伤。人们烧的都是大块大块的煤块子，几十斤重，几百斤重。外地一般见到的那种煤末子，从来无人问津；绝不是夸张，送人都没人要。神木县发生过这样一个故事：煤炭公司的煤末子堆积如山，无法处理，公司领导熬煎得不知如何是好，幸好电厂答应要了，就赶紧让他们天天来拉。这样，电厂发了三年的电，燃料没花一分钱，而煤炭公司还千恩万谢，感激为他们清除了垃圾。国外流行什么黑色幽默，真正的黑色幽默，原在这里。
    过春节与元宵节，这儿除了和一般地区那样点灯笼之外，还要点火塔。火塔用煤砌成，大多一两米高。火塔点亮的时候，从城镇到农村，大街小巷，前山后洼，家家户户门庭前，都是一片辉煌一片明。机关单位气魄自然要大得多，有的砌个火塔，就要用去满满三卡车的煤。如此多而雄伟的火塔彻夜点燃，翌日看，天却还是蓝漾漾的，云却还是白生生的，也留不下多少垃圾，每个煤塔只化作一层白雪似的灰烬。这儿煤的品位之优，于此便可窥知一二。经科学鉴定，它低灰，低硫，低磷，瓦斯的含量几乎等于零。
    窟野河有一条支流，叫做乌兰木伦河。沿着乌兰木伦河驱车飞驰，举目望去，连绵群山之上，那山花竞放，如朝霞漫染，尽皆泛着隐隐的红光。如是火烧山。近了看，一层一层的山岩，如热血浸透，如炉膛滚出，还似散发着烤人的余温。那是火烧岩。火烧山和火烧岩，都是煤田自燃的结果。据说，有些地方上层燃了，底层还完好无损，有些地方则从上自下燃了一二十里深，不复存一块煤炭。几万年来，几千年来，朝朝代代，年年月月，已经燃去多少？够多少工厂多少家庭烧多少年多少月多少日子？纵有电脑，纵有史丰收的快速计算法，也很难算出。而有些至今还在燃，缕缕青烟飘出山缝。问煤田：“汝成于何时？”煤田说了，说的却是庄户人觉得非常陌生的名词，像从秦皇陵中掘出来的，像从太平洋中捞起来的。它说是“侏罗纪”。“侏罗纪”距今已有1.4亿多万年。亿万年的相思，亿万年的等候，亿万年的期待，怎不教它燃烧得如癫如狂！
    但我们总算和它亲近了，总算更清晰地看清它的黑牡丹似的姣好容颜了。它半截脸在这儿，在神木、府谷一带，叫神府煤田；半截脸在内蒙南部的东胜一带，叫东胜煤田。两片煤田合起来，完整的名字是神府东胜煤田，真真是个浩瀚的煤海。更可喜的是，海下有海，海下有海，海下有海，海，有五重。总储量相当于165个抚顺，可以说盖世无双，居于世界八大煤田之首。难怪有些前来考察的外宾，一边赞叹，一边幽默地说，对此，真教他们有点儿忌妒了。哦，我们这块古大陆，我们这片如同我们民族一样经历过巨大灾难的土地，怎能不深蕴着如此丰厚的希望！
    消息传出，整个地球为之一颤。美、日、法、英等十多个国家，都感觉到了，都表示了十分热切的投资兴趣。这片土地上的人们更不用说了，一个个像在生命中注入了新的活力，一个个奔走相告：“从前总说咱们只有白宝（羊绒），现在，咱们又有黑宝啦！”
    被灿灿发光的黑宝所召唤，万古苍凉之地，现代化的采煤队伍走来。在大柳塔，先来了38人，号称“38军”，尔后又是129人，号称“129师”。多么自豪的采煤大军！在大漠，在河道，在沟洼，采黑宝的宏伟场面铺开了，有如世界热潮舞的演出。一河为界，河西是陕西，河东是内蒙，都干得大汗淋漓。因为有了煤矿，一些曾经是连30户人都不到的小镇子，现在骤增为三四万；一些从来不会卖东西的庄户人，也提起了鸡蛋筐子。饭铺、旅社、照相馆、百货商店，浴池……雨后春笋般拔地而起，一派繁华景象。
    走一处：矿。又一处：矿。那些矿多是冲着山根凿进去，凿出平井斜井。平井是平卧的蟒，斜井是斜卧的蟒，巍巍高山猛压着它们，它们就张开大口，吐，吐，吐出不尽的煤。而大型露天矿又是另一番壮观景致。十几米厚的煤层，如无暇墨玉，无一矸石。那是精煤的悬崖，精煤的绝壁，精煤的高楼大厦。人都道，此精煤可气化使用，还可把这煤粉和水一道喷出去，也像可燃气一般好烧。而这煤又是如此之多。天和地几欲合拢，是煤，才把它们远远撑开。站在煤顶上喊话，你必须细听才能听清，而那声音是被染黑了的。望着这深厚煤层，你不由一番惊叹接着一番惊叹，你不能不为这块土地的如此富饶而欣喜万端。这是一幅奇伟的中国画，只有中国的笔墨才能画出。画的时候，笔有多重，墨有多饱多浓，即令花上八百年时间，也难以估透。钢铁的机械震响着。它似乎有些垂头丧气。它问：“这么多的煤，何时方可采完？”矿长笑答：“光咱这个矿，用不了多少日子，二百年吧。”看来，整个神府煤田，够我们放心采了。这片煤田已被列入“七五”期间国家重点建设项目，我国煤炭生产的重点，将要由东部转到西部。愿一股大漠来风，将此信息，传遍祖国四方！
    腿在这儿走，眼在这儿看，到处都是富饶的一片。曾在印象中的荒寂、荒寂，荒寂，将永远和这儿告别了。神府精煤源源出口，已经换取了大宗外汇。火车的汽笛已在这儿声声长鸣。希望在即。然而，这儿的煤层没有夹矸，煤田的开发中却含着忧患。人们痛心地看见，如此宝贵的资源，却一哄而上：国家挖，省上挖，地区挖，县上挖，乡上挖，村上挖，集体挖，个人挖，弄不清来自哪儿的人也挖。人群密密麻麻，挤挤挨挨，咕咕涌涌，在挖，在打洞，在抢噬。好多人都是看见什么地方得利快就挖什么地方。表土和杂石乱堆。挖下半截就甩了。几年之间，这片煤田的许多地段，竟被挖得体无完肤，疮痍满目，破碎不堪。幸好，对这种野蛮破坏资源的严重局面，已经引起有关部门的注意了，并且略有改观。但是，人们要说的是，还必须采取更加有力的举措，使它得到彻底止息。须知，损伤这片煤田，就是损伤我们心爱的祖国的黑黑的瞳仁啊！
