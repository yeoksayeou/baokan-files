The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today, announcing the suspension of diplomatic relations with Grenada.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

On July 19, 1989, the Grenadian government announced the establishment of so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities. The Chinese Ambassador to Grenada, acting on instructions, repeatedly lodged a serious protest with the Grenadian government. However, the Grenadian government ignored the Chinese government's position and insisted on its erroneous decision.

The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Grenadian government's erroneous decision violates the principles of the 1985 Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and Grenada and the Grenadian government's commitment that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, acting on instructions, announces: The Chinese government suspends diplomatic relations with Grenada. All consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the Grenadian government.

The Chinese government's consistent position on the Taiwan question has been understood, respected, and supported by all countries that have established diplomatic relations with us. We firmly oppose the establishment of official relations and official-level exchanges between countries that have diplomatic relations with us and Taiwan. We do not object to economic and cultural exchanges of a purely civilian nature between them and Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities' so-called "flexible diplomacy," seeking "dual recognition," and plotting to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" are doomed to failure. The Chinese people will ultimately achieve the great cause of national reunification, which is the trend of history and the will of the people, and no force can stop it.

The Chinese people value the friendship with the Grenadian people. We hope that the Grenadian government, from the perspective of the long-term interests of Sino-Grenadian relations, will correct its erroneous decision, return to the principles and positions of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and Grenada, and restore normal relations between the two countries, so that friendly cooperation between the two countries can continue to develop.

### 外交部发表声明  我国中止同格林纳达外交关系

    外交部发表声明
    我国中止同格林纳达外交关系
    本报北京8月7日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天发表声明，中国中止同格林纳达的外交关系。
    声明全文如下：
    1989年7月19日，格林纳达政府宣布与台湾当局建立所谓“外交关系”。中国兼驻格林纳达大使奉命一再向格林纳达政府进行了严正交涉。但是，格林纳达政府仍无视中国政府的立场，坚持其错误决定。
    中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。格林纳达政府的错误决定，违背了1985年中格建交联合公报的原则和格林纳达政府关于台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分的承诺。中华人民共和国外交部奉命宣布：中国政府中止中国同格林纳达的外交关系，由此而产生的一切后果，应由格林纳达政府承担。
    中国在台湾问题上的一贯立场，得到了世界上所有同我建交的国家的理解、尊重和支持。我们坚决反对与我建交国家同台湾建立官方关系和进行具有官方性质的往来，对它们同台湾之间完全属于民间性质的经济贸易和文化往来则不持异议。台湾当局推行所谓“弹性外交”，搞“双重承认”，制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”的图谋是绝对不可能得逞的。中国人民终究要实现祖国的统一大业，这是大势所趋，人心所向，是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    中国人民珍视同格林纳达人民的友谊。希望格林纳达政府从中格关系的长远利益出发，纠正其错误决定，重新回到中格建交公报的原则立场上来，使两国关系得以恢复正常，两国友好合作得以继续发展。
