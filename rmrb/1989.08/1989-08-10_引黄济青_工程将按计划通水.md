The "Yellow River Water Transfer to Qingdao" project, a key construction project in China's "Seventh Five-Year Plan," aims to solve the water shortage problem in Qingdao City by diverting water from the Yellow River. Currently, 90% of the project has been completed, and water will flow as scheduled in October this year.

The *Construction Daily* reported that this project is another large-scale inter-basin water transfer project following the "Transfer Water from Luan River to Tianjin." The entire project includes the construction of a 248.6-kilometer-long open canal, five levels of water pump stations along the route, the Qixia Reservoir in the suburbs of Qingdao City for water storage, and a 24-kilometer-long low-pressure underground pipeline to deliver water to the water treatment plants.
