In the past, rural youth had a common saying: "Worst comes to worst, I'll go back home and fix the Earth," as if the iron rice bowl of farmers was secure. Now, in some places, even "fixing the Earth" requires qualifications!

The Impact of the "Green Card" System

Xinhua News Agency reporters Jiang Shan and Li Jinghua

In the suburbs of Beijing, in the village of Banbi in Daxing County, farmer Zhang Xingtai, despite being over sixty, rides his bicycle to the county seat every Monday, covering over 30 kilometers each way, leaving early and returning late, regardless of the weather. Is he going to the market? No. Is he visiting relatives? No. It turns out that since last summer, he has been paying to attend a county-level fruit tree technology training class.

Old man Zhang Xingtai is so passionate about learning agricultural technology because he is aiming to obtain a "Green Card" certificate.

What is the "Green Card"? When the reporter asked Daxing County Magistrate Liu Zhenshan about this, the response was: The "Green Card" system can be considered a "business license" for fixing the Earth.

Daxing County is located in the southern suburbs of Beijing, in the Yongding River basin, with vast areas of sandy land suitable for growing various fruits. The county has 100,000 mu of fruit trees. However, for many years, many fruit tree managers have not undergone specialized technical training and are accustomed to extensive management and exploitative operations, resulting in low and unstable fruit yields. This situation is far from the requirement to quickly build Daxing County into a modern fruit base for Beijing. It is clear that the main problem lies in the low quality of agricultural laborers.

How to accelerate the process of farmers learning scientific and technological knowledge? Daxing County government, referring to the practice of some developed countries in the West that implement a "Green Card" system for vocational education in rural areas, issued the "Several Provisional Regulations on the Technical Qualifications Required for Contracting Fruit Trees" in April last year, deciding to implement the "Green Card" system starting from the end of this year.

This system clearly stipulates that only those who obtain the "Fruit Tree Contracting Technical Permit" issued by the county government have the qualifications for fruit tree management, otherwise, they will not be considered. Since this "Fruit Tree Contracting Technical Permit" is a green-covered card, it is simply referred to as the "Green Card." Soon, county-run and township-run fruit tree technology training classes emerged in Daxing County.

Daxing County's move quickly attracted attention. Two months later, the joint investigation team of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference conducted investigations in 8 counties (districts) in the suburbs of Beijing, including Daxing and Fangshan. They wrote in their report: "All developed countries have developed vocational and technical education. The system of 'training first, then employment' should be promoted. County (district), township (town), and village-run enterprises should first recruit graduates from vocational and technical schools; individuals with 'Technical Training Completion Certificates' can be given priority to contract orchards, vegetable gardens, and collective pig farms and chicken farms, etc." Thus, the "Green Card" system blossomed in many places in the suburbs of Beijing.

Coincidentally, in other rural areas of China, the "Green Card" system has also begun to be implemented. For example, in Quxian County's Erhui District in Sichuan Province, last year, the land contracting system was changed to a land leasing system, and several land leasing conditions were formulated, including the level of scientific farming. Farmers must undergo qualification reviews by the village committee before participating in land leasing bidding. Those who do not meet the conditions cannot participate in the bidding.

Hunan Province's Taoyuan County is another example. The county party committee and government formulated the "Green Card" system for the next few years, gradually implementing primary, intermediate, and advanced three levels of "Green Card" certificates. For example, primary level holders must have junior high school education and primary technical level, which is the basic qualification for obtaining land contracting and operating rights. The county government will give preferential treatment in technical promotion, economic loans, and children's further education to those who obtain the "Green Card."

There are also places like Zhoujiazhuang Township in Jinxian County, Hebei Province, and some counties in the suburbs of Shanghai, where the government has formulated relevant regulations for the implementation of nine-year compulsory education in rural areas, clearly stipulating that rural youth under the age of 16 and with less than junior high school education cannot participate in agricultural production, contract farmland, or work in township and village enterprises.

From the actual situation of implementing the "Green Card" system in various places, they all have the following characteristics: First, they have specific requirements for the scientific and technological knowledge that farmers should master, and many places use the current agricultural college or vocational school textbooks; second, the issuance of certificates is strict, mostly handled and approved by a department designated or entrusted by the county government; third, the issuance of the "Green Card" system is done by the county and township governments. Several educators told the reporter: "Such matters can only be spoken by the government to have authority and be effective. If it is only done by the education department, it will not work."

The implementation of the "Green Card" system in some rural areas of China has strongly promoted the development of farmers' vocational and technical education, forming a powerful impact, which is indeed:

A Stone Throws Up...

Impact Wave One: Promoting farmers' enthusiasm for learning technology.

After the implementation of the land leasing qualification review in Erhui District, Quxian County, the farmers' iron rice bowl was shaken, making them realize their own value. In the past, some farmers who went out to work would always say, "Worst comes to worst, I'll go back home and fix the Earth," as if the farmers' iron rice bowl was secure. But now, if someone goes to the villages of Erhui District, Quxian County, and says this, they might suffer a great loss. A farmer who had the money to pay the rent but lacked scientific farming skills and was eliminated said, "I didn't expect that I could earn money but didn't have the qualifications to farm. In the future, I can't be an unqualified farmer anymore." In the past, when the government spent money to "hire" farmers to learn scientific and technological knowledge, some farmers thought it was a waste and didn't want to study. Now, farmers are flocking to pay to study, even finding ways to get in, changing from passive learning to active learning.

Impact Wave Two: Strengthening adult education work in rural areas.

Wang Peijin, director of the Daxing County Adult Education Bureau, told the reporter that for many years, adult education work in rural areas has been optional, loose, and in a state of self-flow. The implementation of the "Green Card" system has made adult education work institutionalized and regularized. Taking the fruit tree management technology training class as an example, the county government stipulated that the "Green Card" system will be implemented by the end of this year. Thus, the 100,000 mu of fruit trees in the county, with an average of 50 mu per contractor, need to train about 2,000 people, turning the soft task of farmers' adult vocational education into a hard task that must be done. In the past, when the county adult education bureau's staff went to the countryside, the township and village cadres would avoid them because they thought this work was difficult to grasp and didn't want to grasp it; now, each township and village is eager to invite the county adult education bureau's staff to discuss how to run schools. Now, Daxing County not only has county-run farmer training classes, but also township-run and village-run classes, forming a three-level training class system of county, township, and village for adult education.

Impact Wave Three: Enhancing the awareness of middle and primary school students to study science and culture.

In Taoyuan County, since the county announced the implementation of the "Green Card" system, some slogans urging people to study hard have spread in schools: "From now on, uneducated people are not allowed to farm!" "Contracting farmland also requires a technical certificate!" Those who have good grades have already seen through this and are studying even harder; those who usually don't study hard or haven't been admitted to junior high school or high school are scratching their heads in anxiety; those who dropped out of school have quietly returned to their desks.

Call for Rule by Law in Education

"To do anything well, there must be pressure and motivation," Liu Zhenshan analyzed to the reporter, "The government's announcement of the implementation of the 'Green Card' system makes farmers feel that learning is their own business, and it can also be said that this kind of learning has a certain coercive nature."

This is rule by law in education. In an article, Shen Peixin, deputy director of the Anhui Provincial Education Commission, wrote: "The existence of students' dislike for school and dropping out of school in primary and secondary schools is not only due to the subjective reasons of the schools themselves, such as knowledge being detached from reality, but also has deep-seated social reasons. One of the most prominent is the weak social awareness of compulsory education and the lack of strict rule by law in education. Many parents think that whether their children go to school or not is a family matter and do not know that forcing children to drop out of school to earn money is an illegal behavior. Therefore, to ultimately solve this problem, it is necessary to rely on the rectification of social order, turning 'soft law' into 'hard law,' and improving the laws and regulations that are not perfect, especially the procedures and division of responsibilities of the enforcement agencies, to clarify the responsibilities and obligations of the government, schools, parents, and students."

"The 'Green Card' system has long been implemented abroad." Wang Mingda, deputy director of the State Education Commission, told the reporter that some Western countries have established strict graduation examinations and certificate issuance systems for farmers' technical education. For example, the governments of France, Britain, Japan, and other countries stipulate that farmers must complete a certain amount of agricultural vocational and technical education, and those who pass the examination are issued a "Green Card" or "Agricultural Competence Certificate," etc. Only then do they have the qualifications to be farmers. Since these countries began to formulate and use a series of laws, regulations, and systems in the 1950s to compel farmers to learn and promote agricultural technology, the level of scientific farming has been significantly improved. Many countries have gone from being import countries to export countries for agricultural and sideline products.

Yes, the reality in China is so severe: Although the income level of Chinese farmers has been continuously improving in recent years, the number of illiterates has been decreasing, and the number of illiterates and scientifically illiterate people has been increasing. It is obvious that relying solely on farmers' self-awareness to carry out literacy and the promotion of agricultural technology is not enough. It is necessary to adopt legislative measures to compulsorily promote compulsory education and adult education for farmers.

The impact wave of the "Green Card" system calls for rule by law in education!

### “绿卡制度”的冲击波

专栏：

    过去农村青年有句口头禅：“大不了回家修地球”，似乎农民的铁饭碗是稳端的了。如今在一些地方，“修地球”还要看你有没有资格呢！
    “绿卡制度”的冲击波
    新华社记者　江山　李京华
    北京市郊区大兴县半壁村农民张兴太，别看年逾六旬，每个星期一都要骑自行车到县城跑一趟，来回就是30多公里，早出晚归，风雨无阻。去赶集？不是。去探亲？也不是。原来，他从去年夏天开始，自费参加了县果树技术培训班的学习。
    张兴太老汉如此醉心于学习农业技术，却是为了获得一张“绿卡证书”。
    “绿卡”是怎么回事？当记者这样问大兴县县长刘振山时，得到的回答是：“绿卡制度”可以说是——
    修理地球的“营业执照”
    大兴县地处北京市南郊永定河流域，境内多沙地，适宜栽培多种瓜果，全县仅果树就有10万亩。但是，多年来，不少果树管理人员没有经过专门的技术培训，习惯于粗放管理，搞掠夺式经营，致使瓜果产量低而不稳。这种状况，同尽快把大兴县建成北京市现代化瓜果基地的要求相距甚远。显而易见，主要问题在于农业劳动者的素质太低。
    怎样加快农民学习科技知识的进程？大兴县政府参照西方一些发达国家对农村职业教育实行“绿卡证书”的做法，于去年4月做出了“关于承包果树必须取得技术资格的几项暂行规定”，决定从今年底开始实行“绿卡制度”。
    这一制度明确规定，只有获得县政府颁发的“果树承包技术许可证”者，才具备果树管理的资格，否则不予考虑。由于这本“果树承包技术许可证”是个绿色封面的卡片，因而简称为“绿卡”。不久，一个个县办、乡办果树技术培训班就在大兴县应运而生了。
    大兴县的这一举动很快引起了人们的注意。两个月后，中共北京市顾委和市政协联合调查组先后到市郊大兴、房山等8个县（区）进行调查。他们在报告中这样写道：“凡是发达的国家都有发达的职业技术教育，应推行‘先培训，后上岗’的制度。县（区）、乡（镇）和村办企业在招收新职工时，必须首先从职业技术学校毕业生中优先录用；对持有《技术培训结业证》的个人可优先承包果园、菜园和集体猪场、鸡场等。”这样，“绿卡制度”在北京市郊区许多地方开花了。
    无独有偶。在我国农村的其他地方，也有开始实行“绿卡制度”的。如四川省渠县二汇区，去年将土地承包耕种制改为土地租赁耕种制，制定了若干土地租赁条件，其中包括科学种田水平。农民在参加租赁投标前，必须接受村民委员会的资格审查。不够条件者，不能参加租赁投标。
    湖南省桃源县是另一个例子。这个县的县委、县政府于去年制定了在今后几年内逐步试行初、中、高三个等级“绿色证书”的制度。像初级者必须具有初中文化和初级技术水平，这是取得土地承包和经营权的起码资格。对于“绿色证书”的获得者，县政府将在技术推广、经济贷款、子女深造等方面给予优惠。
    还有的像河北省晋县周家庄乡、上海市郊区一些县的政府，对农村实行九年制义务教育制定了有关的规章制度，明文规定农村青少年凡年龄不足16周岁、文化程度不足初中水平者，不得参加农业生产劳动、承包农田或进入乡村企业工作。
    从各地实行“绿卡制度”的实际情况来看，它们都具有这样几个特点：一是对农民应掌握的科技知识有具体的要求，许多地方采用了目前农业大专或中专学校的通用教材；二是颁发证书掌握较严，多是由县政府指定或委托县里某个部门负责办理和审批；三是出面制定和颁发“绿卡制度”的都是县、乡政府。几位教育界人士对记者说：“这样的事，只有政府出面说话，才能有权威、行得通，如果单靠教育部门来办就不行。”
      “绿卡制度”在我国一些农村的试行，有力地推动了农民职业技术教育事业的发展，形成了强大的冲击波，正是——
    一石激起……
    冲击波之一：促进了农民学习技术的积极性。
    渠县二汇区实行租种土地资格审查后，触动了农民的铁饭碗，使他们认识到了自身的价值。过去，有些外出做工的农民遇到什么事情，总有一句口头禅：“大不了回家修地球。”似乎农民的铁饭碗是端稳了的。可现在，如果谁要是到渠县二汇区的乡村去说这句话，那他就可能要吃大亏。一位有钱交租金却无科学种田水平而被刷下来的农民说：“没想到，我有办法挣钱，却无资格种田，今后再不能当不合格的农民了。”过去，由政府出钱“雇”农民学习科学技术，有的农民还以为“花不来”、“吃了亏”，而不愿上学。现在，农民们纷纷自费甚至走后门上学，由被动学变成了主动学。
    冲击波之二：强化了农村成人教育的工作。
    大兴县成人教育局局长王丕金告诉记者，多年来，农村成人教育工作一直是可有可无，可松可紧，处于自流状态。“绿卡制度”的实行，使成人教育工作走上了制度化、正规化。就拿果树管理技术培训班来说，县政府规定今年底实行“绿卡制度”，这样全县的10万亩果树，按平均50亩一个承包者，大约需要培训2000人，使农民成人职业教育的软任务一下子变成硬任务，非搞不可。过去县成人教育局的干部下乡，乡、村干部都躲着走，因为他们担心这项工作不好抓，也不愿抓；现在各乡、村都抢着请县成人教育局的干部去他们那儿，共商办学之事。如今，大兴县不仅县上办农民培训班，乡里也办，村里也办，全县已形成了由县、乡、村三级培训班组成的成人教育系统。
    冲击波之三：增强了中小学生学好科学文化的自觉性。
    在桃源县，自从县上宣布要实行“绿色证书”后，一些劝导人们好好学习的“警言”在学校里不胫而走：“从今往后，大老粗不让种地了！”“承包农田也要有技术证书了！”那些学习成绩好的，早看透了这步棋，学得更加上劲了；平时学习不用功的，或者没有考上初中、高中的，抓耳挠腮着了急；中途退了学的，又悄悄地回到了课桌旁。
    呼唤以法治教
    “干任何事情都必须有一种压力和动力，这样才干得好”，刘振山对记者分析道，“政府宣布实行‘绿卡制度’，使农民觉得学习是自己的事，也可以说，这种学习带有一定的强制性。”
    这就是以法治教。安徽省政府教委副主任沈培新在一篇文章中写道：“中小学生存在厌学、弃学现象，除了学校本身存在知识脱离实际等主观原因外，还有其深层的社会原因，其中比较突出的就是整个社会依法普及义务教育的观念淡薄，依法治教不严。有相当多的家长认为，子女上不上学是家庭的事，不懂得逼子女辍学挣钱是违法行为。因此，最终解决这个问题，必须有赖于社会秩序的整治，变‘软法’为‘硬法’，对法律、法规不完善的地方，特别是执法程序和职能部门的分工要日趋完善，明确政府、学校、家长以及学生各自的责任和义务。”
      “国外实行‘绿卡制度’早已有之。”国家教委副主任王明达告诉记者，西方一些国家对农民技术教育建立了严格的毕业考试和发放证书等制度。比如法国、英国、日本等国政府规定，农民必须完成一定的农业职业技术教育，考试合格者发给“绿色证书”，或称“农业能力证书”等。这样，才有资格当农民。由于这些国家从50年代开始，制定和运用一系列法律、法规和制度，来强制农民学习、推广农业技术，农业科学种田水平有了显著的提高，许多国家的农副产品由过去的进口国，一跃成为出口国。
    是的，中国的现实是这样的严峻：中国农民的收入水平近年来虽然在不断提高，脱盲人数却在下降，文盲、科盲不断增加，可见单靠农民自觉求知来开展扫盲和推广农业技术是不够的，必须采取立法手段，强制推行义务教育和农民成人教育。
    “绿卡制度”的冲击波，向人们呼唤以法治教！
