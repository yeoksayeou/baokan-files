New China News Agency, Harbin, August 10th.

A symposium on Deng Xiaoping's theory of party building concluded today in Harbin.

Representatives from the Central Committee's Organization Department, the Central Party Building Leadership Group, the Central Party School, and party workers from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, as well as managers and party secretaries from some large and medium-sized enterprises, attended the symposium. Participants agreed that Deng Xiaoping, using Marxist principles, has made significant contributions to the political, ideological, and organizational aspects of party building. Deng's thoughts on strengthening party building are an integral part of Mao Zedong's theory on party building and represent a development and enrichment of Mao's ideas. Studying and researching Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on party building is crucial for strengthening party leadership, ensuring the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

In response to the ideological confusion and the spread of bourgeois liberalization in the previous period, some representatives emphasized that strengthening ideological party building is fundamental to ensuring that party organizations implement party lines, principles, and policies, and to enhancing the party's combat effectiveness. The party must strengthen the ideological education of its members and lead the ideological domain.

Delegates also had in-depth discussions on party organizational building, work style, standards for party members in the new era, and the role and position of party organizations in enterprises.

The four-day symposium was jointly organized by the *Study* magazine and the provincial organization departments of the three northeastern provinces.

    有关方面人士聚会哈尔滨
    研讨邓小平党建理论
    新华社哈尔滨8月10日电　（记者胡清海）邓小平党的建设理论研讨会今天在哈尔滨结束。
    中共中央组织部、中央党建领导小组、中央党校等有关方面的研究人员和辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省的一些党务工作者、部分大中型企业的厂长、党委书记出席了研讨会。与会者认为，邓小平同志运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，对党在政治思想、组织作风和制度建设方面作出了重大贡献。邓小平关于加强党的建设的一系列重要思想是毛泽东建党理论的有机组成部分，是对毛泽东建党理论的丰富和发展。学习、研究邓小平同志关于党的建设的思想，对于加强党的领导，保证改革、开放的顺利进行，建设有中国特色的社会主义具有十分重要的意义。
    针对前一时期思想混乱、资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的状况，一些代表认为，加强党的思想建设，是党组织贯彻党的路线、方针、政策，提高党的战斗力的根本保证。党必须加强对广大党员的马克思主义理论教育，必须加强对意识形态领域的领导。
    与会代表还对党的组织建设、作风建设、新时期党员的标准、企业党组织的地位和作用等问题进行了认真讨论。
    历时4天的研讨会是由《学习》杂志社和东北三省省委组织部联合举办的。
