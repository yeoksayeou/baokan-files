Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 1st.

The reporter learned from yesterday's mobilization meeting on eliminating corruption and improving service quality in the city's health system that the Shanxi Provincial Health Bureau has decided to launch a large-scale campaign to promote medical integrity and quality service, with the provincial capital as the focus, and throughout the entire province.

The decision points out that during this campaign, the focus will be on strengthening medical ethics education, prohibiting the use of medical practices for personal gain or the misuse of power; prohibiting the acceptance of gifts, red envelopes, or kickbacks under any pretext; and prohibiting the exploitation of patients' difficulties to extort money or engage in unscrupulous personal "revenue generation." Medical integrity should be included as a key component in the evaluation and reward/punishment system for departments and individuals.

The decision requires all medical and health institutions to rectify medical order, strengthen job responsibilities, and strictly enforce labor discipline. The boundaries between regular work and part-time services, as well as between regular work quotas and over-quota work, must be strictly delineated. While ensuring the timely, high-quality, and quantitative completion of regular duties, part-time and secondary jobs are permitted, but must be organized, managed, and billed uniformly by the institution, with revenues distributed uniformly.

The decision emphasizes the importance of rational drug use and strictly prohibits the issuance of large prescriptions, emotional prescriptions, and the indiscriminate prescription of nutritional, tonic, and health supplements.

    廉洁行医
    山西卫生系统清除腐败现象
    据新华社太原8月1日电  （记者薄先锋）记者从昨天召开的省城卫生系统清除腐败现象、搞好优质服务动员大会上获悉：山西卫生厅做出决定，从现在起，以省城为重点，在全省范围内大张旗鼓地开展廉洁行医优质服务活动。
    决定指出，在这一活动中，重点是加强医德教育，不准以医谋私、以权谋私；不准以各种理由和形式吃请受礼、拿“红包”吃“回扣”；不准乘人之难索收钱财和不择手段提取个人“创收”。要把廉洁从医列入对科室和个人进行考核、奖惩的重要内容。
    决定要求各医疗卫生单位整顿医疗秩序，加强岗位职责，严格劳动纪律。严格分清正常工作和业余服务、正常工作定额和超定额工作的界线，在保时、保质、保量完成本职工作的前提下，允许开展业余和兼职服务，但必须由单位实行统一组织、统一管理、统一收费和统一分配。
    决定强调坚持合理用药，严格杜绝“大处方”、“人情方”和滥开营养、滋补保健药品。
