Over the past year, our region has implemented a series of policies to encourage pig farming, resulting in a steady increase in the pig inventory. In the first quarter of this year, our region's pig inventory reached 416,000 head, an 18% increase over the same period last year. Currently, the entire region still has more than 30,000 market-ready pigs weighing over 100 kilograms.

The main reasons for the current pig accumulation are as follows: First, although it is currently the peak season for selling pigs, consumption has shifted to the off-season, and the cold storage capacity of commercial food departments is limited, with most storage facilities already full. Second, the allocation channels are not smooth, and the main pig-producing areas generally have more production than sales, making it difficult to export. Third, the pig-to-grain price ratio is unreasonable. Currently, the market price of corn is 0.72 yuan per kilogram, while the average purchase price for pigs is 2.2 yuan per kilogram. Pig farming is less profitable than selling grain, causing farmers to rush to sell their pigs. Fourth, funds are severely insufficient. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of April, our region's food department owed farmers 1.4 million yuan in pig sales payments. Under normal business operations, our region currently needs to supplement an additional 6 million yuan in funds.

The issuance of IOUs not only dampens farmers' enthusiasm but also has a negative impact on pig production. According to investigations, the price of piglets has dropped from around 6 yuan per kilogram before and after the Spring Festival to around 2 yuan per kilogram now, and it continues to decline. Due to the low returns from raising sows, farmers occasionally sell or slaughter their sows. According to the pig production cycle, if the current accumulated fat pigs cannot be sold in time, next year's pig production may decline.

The article is written in the style of a report, presenting the facts and issues related to the difficulties in selling pigs in the rural areas of Huimin. The tone is informative and objective, reflecting the challenges faced by farmers and the need for policy adjustments to support pig farming and ensure smooth sales channels.

### 惠民农村出现卖猪难

    惠民农村出现卖猪难
    去年以来，我地区采取了一系列鼓励养猪的政策，生猪存栏量稳步上升。今年第一季度，我地区生猪存栏达41.6万头，比去年同期增长18％。目前，全区仍有100公斤重以上的商品猪3万多头。
    造成当前生猪积压的主要原因：一是眼下正值生猪出售旺季，而消费却转为淡季，商业食品部门冷库容量有限，大都库存饱和。二是调拨渠道不畅通，生猪主要产区普遍产大于销，外调难度大。三是猪粮比价不合理，现在，市场上玉米价格每公斤0.72元，而生猪收购价格平均每公斤2.2元，养猪不如卖粮，致使农民急于抛售。四是资金严重不足，据不完全统计，至4月底，我区食品部门已拖欠农民卖猪款140万元。按正常业务开支，目前我区还急需补充资金600万元。
    白条子出现，既挫伤了农民的积极性，又给生猪生产带来不良影响。
    据调查，我地区仔猪价格由春节前后的每公斤6元左右，下降到现在的每公斤2元左右，并且仍有下降的趋势。由于饲养母猪收益低，农户出售、宰杀母猪的现象也时有发生。按照生猪生产周期，如果现在积压的肥猪不能及时出售，来年的生猪将出现滑坡。
