China's first test-tube calf was born today at 11:20 AM at the Experimental Animal Research Center of Inner Mongolia University. The male calf weighs 30 kilograms.

This achievement follows the birth of China's first batch of test-tube sheep in the same location. The project was led by Dr. Xurijigan, a renowned biotechnology expert known as the "father of test-tube sheep," and completed by his research team after more than two years of hard work. This project is a key research initiative of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" and has been included in the national 863 High-Tech Development Plan this year. It is a research achievement at the international advanced level.

    我国生物工程又一重大成果
    第一胎试管牛诞生
    新华社呼和浩特8月15日电　（记者白斯古郎）我国第一胎“试管”牛，今天11时20分在内蒙古大学实验动物研究中心诞生。这头雄性小牛体重30公斤。
    这是继我国首批“试管绵羊”在这里诞生后的又一项重大科研成果。这个项目是由被称为“试管羊”之父的我国著名生物工程专家旭日干博士指导的科研小组，经过两年多艰苦拚搏完成的。该项目是内蒙古自治区“七五”重点科研项目，今年又被列入国家863高技术发展计划中，是一项具有国际先进水平的科研成果。
