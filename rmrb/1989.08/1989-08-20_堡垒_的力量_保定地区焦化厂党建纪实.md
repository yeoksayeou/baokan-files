The Baoding Region Coking Plant in Hebei Province is a medium-sized enterprise with over 1,300 employees. From 1984 to 1988, the plant's economic performance steadily improved, achieving a total profit and tax revenue of 23.72 million yuan, making it the top profit-generating enterprise in the region. The unity and hard work of the plant's staff and workers have created this situation, with the key factor being the plant's party organization playing its role as a fighting fortress.

For a period, the plant implemented a factory director responsibility system, and many political workers from nearby factories and mines took on administrative roles. The saying "following the secretary exhausts your legs, but serving the director gets you a cup of water" became popular among the staff and workers, weakening the party's construction and ideological and political work. Factory Party Secretary Cai Shengchun felt very heavy-hearted and discussed with Factory Director Liu Zhi what should be done. Liu Zhi said, "A socialist enterprise cannot deviate from the political track. No matter what economic changes occur, we cannot abandon the party's leadership and the socialist direction. Our party construction and political work team can only be strengthened, not weakened. If the party's leadership is weakened, it will definitely bring disaster to the enterprise. Even if economic benefits rise temporarily, they will not last long." These words were exactly what Cai Shengchun wanted to hear, and the two smiled at each other.

Soon, the factory party committee decided to strengthen party organization and political work team building. All six major workshops in the factory were equipped with full-time party branch secretaries. The party committee's operational agencies were not only not reduced but also added a propaganda and education department, selecting and appointing more than 20 comrades with good political qualities, higher cultural levels, and strong vitality to political work positions, ensuring that the party's work channels did not break down.

To make party building more systematic and efficient, the coking plant's party organization established and improved several systems over the past few years, including the democratic evaluation of party members, party committee members' life meetings, examination of active party member candidates, and party committee guarantee and supervision procedures. At the same time, using a combination of full-time and part-time methods, the party organized members to systematically study basic party knowledge, Marxist philosophy, scientific socialism, political economics, and modern management knowledge. The implementation of these systems and measures improved the quality of party members, strengthened party consciousness, and concretized the party's leadership in the enterprise, while also curbing the occurrence of corruption. Over the past five years, except for two mid-level party member cadres who were severely investigated for violating financial discipline and stealing materials, more than 50 mid-level and above party member leaders remained clean and upright, passing the test in the new situation of reform and opening up.

The fighting strength of the party organization has brought new vitality to the ideological and political work of the entire factory. To adapt to the factory director responsibility system, the factory party committee promptly organized the establishment of a leadership committee for ideological and political work, with the factory director as the chairman, the party committee secretary as the deputy chairman, and the heads of party, political, and trade union departments participating. Each workshop also established a leadership group for ideological and political work, forming a new pattern with administrative cadres as the main body, political workers as the backbone, and party and league members doing ideological and political work, making ideological and political work truly penetrate the entire production and operation process. Since 1986, they have focused on vocational skill training for employees while conducting solid "four-haves" education for all factory staff and workers, striving to cultivate enterprise spirit, organizing workers to discuss "the factory prospers, I am proud; the factory declines, I am ashamed," arousing the political honor and production enthusiasm of cadres and workers, and truly establishing the consciousness of masters. At the beginning of last year, when the factory faced a severe shortage of circulating funds, all employees voluntarily raised 24 million yuan for production, solving the factory's urgent problem. The factory produced more than 120,000 tons of high-quality coke in two years, exceeding the designed capacity by 20%; more than 10 chemical products maintained the best level for two consecutive years. In the "create achievements and contribute" campaign, 71 collectives and 325 cadres and workers have been awarded for their achievements.

Currently, the coking plant has a culture of mutual care, understanding, and respect among cadres and workers, with many touching stories.

    “堡垒”的力量
    ——保定地区焦化厂党建纪实
    李林渊
    河北省保定地区焦化厂是个拥有一千三百余名职工的中型企业。一九八四年至一九八八年，该厂经济效益稳步增长，共实现利税二千三百七十二万元，成为全区所属企业中的利税首户，全厂干部职工团结奋斗，爱厂如家。这种局面的出现，关键在于该厂党组织发挥了战斗堡垒作用。
    有段时期，工厂实行厂长负责制，附近许多厂矿的政工干部纷纷兼任行政职务，干部职工中盛传“跟着书记跑断腿，不如给厂长倒杯水”，削弱了企业党的建设和思想政治工作。厂党委书记柴盛春心情十分沉重，找到厂长刘芝商量到底该怎么办。刘芝说：“社会主义的企业绝不能脱离政治轨道，不管在什么样的经济变化中，都不能放弃党的领导和社会主义方向。我们厂党的建设和政工队伍只能加强，不能削弱。如果削弱党的领导，那必定给企业带来灾难，经济效益一时上去了，也不会长久。”这番话正合柴盛春的心意，两人相对笑了。
    很快，厂党委便作出了加强党的组织建设和政工队伍建设的决定，全厂六个主要车间都配备了专职党支部书记；党委办事机构不但没有裁减，还增设了宣传教育科，选调了二十余名政治素质较好、文化水平较高、年富力强的同志充实到政工岗位，使党的工作渠道没有出现断路。
    为使党的建设有章可循，提高效率，焦化厂党组织在近几年中相继建立和完善了民主评议党员制度、党委成员生活会制度、入党积极分子考查制度和党委保证监督程序。同时，采取脱产和半脱产相结合的办法，组织党员系统地学习党的基本知识，学习马克思主义哲学、科学社会主义、政治经济学等基本理论以及现代管理方面的知识。这些制度和措施的落实，提高了党员的素质，增强了党性观念，使党的领导在企业中得以具体化，同时遏制了腐败现象的发生。五年多来，除两名中层党员干部因违犯财经纪律和偷盗物资受到严肃查处外，五十多名中层以上党员领导干部两袖清风，一身正气，在改革开放新形势下经受住了考验。
    党组织的战斗力不断增强，给全厂的思想政治工作带来勃勃生机。为了适应厂长负责制，厂党委及时组织成立了由厂长任主任、党委书记任副主任、党政工团等部门负责人参加的思想政治工作领导委员会，各车间也相应成立了思想政治工作领导小组，形成了以行政干部为主体、政工干部为骨干、党、团员人人做思想政治工作的新格局，使思想政治工作真正渗透到了生产经营的全过程。一九八六年以来，他们在抓紧对职工进行职业技能训练的同时，扎扎实实地对全厂干部职工进行“四有”教育，努力培养企业精神，组织职工开展“厂兴我荣、厂衰我耻”的讨论，激发了干部职工的政治荣誉感和生产积极性，真正树立起主人翁的思想。去年初，在厂里流动资金严重短缺的情况下，全厂职工自愿集资二百四十万元用于生产，解决了厂里的燃眉之急。全厂两年生产优质焦炭十二万多吨，超过设计能力百分之二十；十多种化工产品连续两年保持最好水平。在开展“创业立功”活动中，已有七十一个集体、三百二十五名干部职工立功受奖。
    目前的焦化厂，干部职工互相关心、互相理解、互相尊重，已形成风气，出现了许多动人的事迹。
