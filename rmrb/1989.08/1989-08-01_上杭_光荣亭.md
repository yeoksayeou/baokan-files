The "Glory Pavilion" is located in Caixi Village, Shanghang County, western Fujian. It is surrounded by towering green mountains on all four sides, with a small bridge and stream to the south, white-walled and black-tiled houses to the north, and lush cypress trees on the east and west. Above the pavilion's entrance hangs a plaque with three bold characters, "Glory Pavilion," written by Comrade Mao Zedong. The pavilion was completed on July 5, 1933. Inside, there stands a monument awarded by the Fujian Provincial Soviet Government, which reads, "We are the first model district." The pavilion displays hundreds of awards, including plaques, banners, and certificates. On either side of the pavilion, stone tablets stand tall, inscribed with the names and brief biographies of martyrs from the district. During the Red May campaign, 199 people from Caixi Township alone joined the Red Army, and the local people donated 8,949 pairs of straw shoes and an uncountable amount of vegetables. In the democratic revolution, 5,901 people from Shanghang County made the ultimate sacrifice. The Glory Pavilion is a monument built with funds from the Fujian Provincial Soviet Government to honor the selfless people of Shanghang.

On this land soaked with the blood of martyrs, the people of Shanghang, following the Communist Party, dared to be the first in the world. In today's reform to eliminate poverty, the people of Shanghang have updated their conservative and closed-minded thinking to embrace the concept of reform and opening up. They have transitioned from the ancient and single-minded practice of plowing with oxen and hoes to the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, broadening the path to prosperity. They are realizing the aspirations of the martyrs, transforming this remote and impoverished land into a land of fish and rice, and nurturing a group of entrepreneurs and specialized households who donate to public welfare, doctors who contribute patented prescriptions, engineers who share technology for free, and world champions in badminton who bring glory to the nation.

    上杭“光荣亭”
    刘玉志
    “光荣亭”坐落在闽西上杭县才溪村东，四面巍巍青山环抱，南有小桥流水，北有白墙黑瓦人家，东西两侧是郁郁葱葱的翠柏。亭前匾额上，是毛泽东同志写的酣畅淋漓的“光荣亭”三个大字。光荣亭落成于一九三三年七月五日，亭中树立着当年福建省苏维埃政府授予的
  “我们是第一个模范区”的光荣碑，陈列着数百件奖匾、奖旗、奖状光荣碑，两旁石碑林立，上面刻着全区烈士名讳和简历。在当年红五月工作中，仅才溪乡就有一百九十九人参加红军，群众送红军草鞋八千九百四十九双，蔬菜不计其数。在民主革命中，上杭县有五千九百零一人光荣牺牲。光荣亭，是福建省苏维埃政府拨款为具有献身精神的上杭人建立的丰碑。
    在这块浸着先烈血迹的土地上的上杭人民，跟着共产党，敢为天下先，在今天消灭贫困的改革中，上杭人又把保守封闭的意识更新为改革开放的观念，从古老单一的牵牛扶犁耕作，变为农林牧副渔全面发展，拓宽了致富之路。他们正实现着先烈们憧憬的目标，已将穷乡僻壤建设为鱼米之乡，造就出一批捐资公益事业的企业家和专业户，献出配制药方专利的医师，无偿传授技术的工程师，为国争光的羽毛球世界冠军。
