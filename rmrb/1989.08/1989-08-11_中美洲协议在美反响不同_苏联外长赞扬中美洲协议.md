The new agreement signed by the presidents of the five Central American countries on August 7th to demobilize the anti-government forces in Nicaragua has elicited differing reactions in the U.S. political arena. Some express support, while others voice dissent. Supporters commend the peace efforts of the Central American leaders, hoping that the anti-government forces will be demobilized according to the timeline proposed in the agreement and safely return to their homeland. Those who hold opposing views believe that the camps of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces in Honduras should not be disbanded before the Nicaraguan government fulfills its promise of holding free elections.

The White House, though having reservations about the new Central American agreement, finds it inconvenient to openly oppose it. However, official spokespeople emphasize that the dissolution of the resistance forces is a "voluntary process" that "more importantly depends on the creation of safe and democratic conditions by Nicaragua."

Since the Bush administration took office, although it has abandoned Reagan's previous stance of intervening militarily in Nicaragua's internal affairs and adjusted its policy towards Nicaragua, it still hopes to use the Nicaraguan anti-government forces to pressure Nicaragua into making greater concessions in domestic democracy and freedom according to U.S. wishes. However, this intention of the U.S. government not only faces opposition internationally but also may not garner support domestically. This issue is bound to reignite debates between the two parties in Congress and between Congress and the government.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made a statement to reporters on the 10th, expressing that the Soviet Union highly values the agreement reached by the five Central American leaders in Honduras and is willing to promote the implementation of the agreement in any way possible.

Shevardnadze stated that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated for the Central American countries to resolve their regional issues independently without external interference. He praised the wisdom, courage, and realistic attitudes displayed by the five leaders during the negotiations. He hopes that the U.S. and Nicaragua can resume direct dialogue to normalize bilateral relations.

### 中美洲协议在美反响不同  苏联外长赞扬中美洲协议

    中美洲协议在美反响不同
    苏联外长赞扬中美洲协议
    本报华盛顿8月10日电  记者张启昕报道：中美洲五国总统8月7日签订的关于遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装的新协议，在美国政界引起了不同反响，一部分人表示支持，另一部分人则表示异议。支持者赞赏中美洲国家首脑的和平努力，希望按照协议提出的时间表遣散尼反政府武装，让他们安全返回本国。持反对意见的人则认为，在尼加拉瓜政府履行自由选举的诺言前，尼反政府武装在洪都拉斯的营地就不应该解散。
    白宫虽对中美洲新协议有保留，却不便公开反对，但官方的发言人强调，抵抗力量的解散是个“自愿的过程”，“更有赖于尼加拉瓜为之创造安全和民主的条件”。
    布什政府上台以来，虽然摒弃了里根昔日以武力干涉尼加拉瓜内部事务的主张，调整了对尼政策，但仍希望借助尼反政府武装力量压尼加拉瓜按美国的意愿在国内民主、自由方面作出更大的让步。然而美国政府的这种意图不仅在国际上遭到反对，而且在国内也未必能得到支持。这个问题势必再度引起国会两党之间、国会与政府之间的争论。
    新华社莫斯科8月10日电苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽10日对记者发表谈话表示，苏联高度评价中美洲5国首脑在洪都拉斯达成的协议，并表示苏联愿意以任何方式促进协议执行。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，苏联一贯主张由中美洲国家自己在不受外来干涉的条件下解决本地区的问题。他赞扬5国首脑在谈判中表现的智慧、勇敢和现实主义的态度。他希望美国和尼加拉瓜能恢复直接对话，以便使两国关系正常化。
