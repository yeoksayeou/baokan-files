During the season of fragrant rice and litchis, we visited Putian City in Fujian Province, known as the "City of Electronic Watches." In recent years, Putian City has fully utilized the various preferential policies available in open regions, actively improved its infrastructure, and vigorously attracted foreign investment to establish electronic watch assembly plants. Currently, the city has 23 export-oriented electronic watch assembly plants, capable of producing 25 million liquid crystal watches, electronic quartz watches, quartz clocks, stopwatches, and more than ten other varieties annually. In 1988, 130 million electronic watches and watch movements were assembled and exported to Hong Kong, the Indian subcontinent, Europe, the Americas, the Soviet Union, and other regions, accounting for 70% and 30% of the low-end electronic watch market in Hong Kong and the world, respectively.

During our visit, we learned that although Putian City's low-end electronic watches have captured nearly one-third of the global market, they are still in the initial stage of "assembly on demand" and "processing with supplied materials," where production is in China and trading is in Hong Kong, with foreign merchants controlling production and sales channels. Obviously, this is not conducive to Putian City's electronic watch manufacturers occupying the international market with final products, thereby reducing risks and losses from intermediary links. It is also not conducive to establishing its own electronic watch industrial system and improving economic benefits.

In the municipal government office, Vice Mayor Yang Xueming, who oversees the electronics industry, told us that relevant department leaders have recognized this crisis. They have proposed the strategic idea of "sailing out in a fleet" and established the "Tianlong (China) Electronic Timing Enterprise Joint Company." Currently, the joint company has begun providing matching components for various electronic watch assembly plants in the city. Putian City will achieve domestic production of 20 million electronic watch components annually, increasing export earnings by five to six million dollars.

    由装配基地向出口基地迈进
    ——访“电子表城”福建省莆田市
    林中奇　张建山
    稻香荔红之际，我们来到有着“电子表城”称誉的福建省莆田市采访。近几年来，莆田市充分利用开放地区所享有的各种优惠政策，积极改善基础设施，大力吸引外资兴办电子表装配厂。目前，全市有外向型电子表装配厂23家，年可装配生产液晶表、电子石英表、石英钟，跑表等十多个品种25000万只。1988年装配出口到香港、印度次大陆、欧洲、美洲、苏联等地的电子表和表芯13000万只，分别占香港和世界低档电子表销量的70％和30％。
    在采访中，我们了解到莆田市低档电子表虽已占领了世界销售市场的近1／3，但仍处在“生产在国内，交换在香港”、由客商调度生产，控制销售渠道的“来件装配”、“来料加工”的初级阶段。显然，这既不利于莆田市电子表厂家以最终产品的形式挤占国际市场，从而减少中间环节带来的风险和损失；也不利于建立自己的电子表工业体系和提高经济效益。
    在市政府办公室，分管电子工业的杨学明副市长告诉我们，市有关部门领导已认识到这种危机。他们提出了“组船出海”的战略设想，并组建了“天龙（中国）电子计时企业联合公司”。目前，联合公司已开始为市内各电子表装配厂提供配套件。莆田市全年将有2000万只电子表元器件实现国产化，增加出口创汇五六百万美元。
