The U.S. Attorney General and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation held a joint press conference recently to announce that a federal grand jury had submitted a 400-page indictment to the federal court in Chicago. The indictment accuses 46 traders and brokers from the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of defrauding clients, manipulating prices, and tax evasion. The number of suspects and the despicable methods used are unprecedented in the history of these two major futures exchanges.

This highly publicized indictment came after the FBI conducted a two-year undercover investigation. Since early 1987, FBI investigators had infiltrated the Chicago futures market, posing as traders or brokers. These "traders," dressed in high-end designer clothes, stayed in luxury hotels in the city center, dined in upscale restaurants, and frequently attended gatherings hosted by traders and brokers. The targets of suspicion and surveillance had no idea that the secret devices hidden on these "colleagues" were recording their conversations in various settings. To avoid detection, these investigators received professional training in futures trading. On the trading floor, they appeared to be conducting business while actually conducting on-site investigations and gathering evidence.

In January of this year, the authorities made the investigation public. Since then, investigators have spoken with over 500 people, issued 500 subpoenas, and reviewed over a million documents and materials.

According to disclosures, over the years, the 46 defendants engaged in illegal trading without scruples. During the severe drought in North America in 1988, the Chicago Board of Trade faced a shortage of goods. Some grain traders and brokers took advantage of the situation by hoarding supplies and conducting secret transactions with "friendly merchants" instead of selling in the open market, thereby reaping huge profits. For example, brokers used "inside information" to profit first before "routine business." Several brokers often reached private agreements before public trading, engaging in favoritism, deceiving clients, or conducting illegal transactions after public trading ended. Some brokers also extorted clients, forged letters, and evaded taxes. Many brokers became instant millionaires, while clients suffered significant losses.

The news of the indictment of 46 traders and brokers left their colleagues in the Chicago futures market silent and reluctant to comment, as they couldn't tell who was a genuine trader or broker and who was an investigator. The media, however, reacted with shock. The *Wall Street Journal* described the scandal as a "nightmare." A prominent futures market analyst in New York said, "This is undoubtedly another blow to the credibility of the U.S. commodity trading market." Many called for reforms in the supervision and management of the futures market to prevent such scandals from recurring.

The defendants have not yet been arrested, but the authorities have ordered them to surrender within 10 days. Attorney General Thornburgh also stated that if found guilty, the heaviest sentences could be 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The investigation into the Chicago futures market is ongoing, and more individuals may be implicated.

### 敲诈勒索  操纵价格  偷税漏税  芝加哥期货市场又爆丑闻本

    敲诈勒索  操纵价格  偷税漏税
    芝加哥期货市场又爆丑闻本
     报记者　张亮
    美国司法部长和联邦调查局局长在日前举行的联合记者招待会上宣布，一联邦大陪审团已向芝加哥联邦法院提交一份长达400页的起诉书，控告芝加哥谷物交易所和商品交易所的46名交易商和经纪人欺骗客户、操纵价格和偷税漏税……涉嫌人数之多、手法之肮脏，在这两大期货交易所史上还属罕见。
    这一众所瞩目的起诉是在联邦调查局经过两年多的秘密调查之后提出的。从1987初开始，联邦调查局的调查人员就装扮成交易商或经纪人，潜入芝加哥期货市场。这些身着高档名牌服装的“交易商”在市中心的豪华旅馆下榻，在高级餐馆用餐，还经常参加交易商和经纪人举办的各种聚会。那些被怀疑和跟踪的对象万万没有料到，暗藏在这些“同事”身上的秘密装置已录下了他们在各种场合的谈话内容。为了不露马脚，这批调查人员接受过有关期货交易的专业训练。在交易场上，他们表面上是在做生意，而实际上则在进行现场调查和搜集确凿证据。
    今年1月司法当局将调查工作公开化。此后，调查人员先后找过500人谈话，发出500张传票，并查阅了100万份的各种文件和材料。
    据披露，几年来46名被告不择手段地进行非法交易。1988年北美大陆发生特大旱灾期间，芝加哥谷物交易所货源紧张，一些谷物交易商和经纪人趁机囤积居奇，不在公开市场上出售，而是秘密地与“友好商人”进行非法交易，从中牟取暴利。又如，经纪人利用自己掌握的“内部情报”先捞一把，然后才“例行公事”。还有，几个经纪人经常在公开交易前就私下达成交易，营私舞弊，欺骗客户，或在公开交易结束后进行各种非法交易活动。有的经纪人还对客户敲诈勒索，伪造信件，偷税漏税。许多经纪人因此成了暴发户，而客户则蒙受了很大损失。
    46名交易商和经纪人被起诉的消息传出后，芝加哥期货市场上的同行们个个都沉默寡言，不敢置评，因为他们搞不清谁是真正的交易商和经纪人，谁是调查人员。而舆论界则顿时哗然，《华尔街日报》称这桩丑闻是一场“最可怕的恶梦”。纽约一位颇有影响的期货市场分析家说，“它对美国商品交易市场的信誉无疑又是一个打击”。许多人还呼吁当局改革对期货市场的监督和管理制度，以杜绝此类丑闻再度发生。
    现在被告尚未被捕，但司法当局限令他们在10天之内投案自首。司法部长索恩伯勒还声称，如果判定他们有罪，重者将被判处20年徒刑和25万美元罚款。目前，对芝加哥期货市场的调查仍在继续，可能还有一批人将会落入法网。
