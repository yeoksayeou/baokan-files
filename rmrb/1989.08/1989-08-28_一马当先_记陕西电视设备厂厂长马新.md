Those who enjoy reading newspapers might recall that on January 17, 1980, the *People's Daily* published a prominent headline on its front page: *"Such Chaos, How Can We Build the Country?—Shanxi Province's Relevant Departments Blindly Converted the Changcheng Electromagnetic Wire Factory into a Tractor Factory, Changing Product Models Three Times, Causing Severe Losses."* This was the sharp criticism directed at the predecessor of the Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory—the Qinchuan Tractor Factory at that time.

This criticism immediately sparked a strong response. The provincial authorities went through great lengths to negotiate with the Ministry of Electronics, relocating the Tongchuan 762 Factory and Xianyang Color Television Factory to the Qinchuan Tractor Factory, merging them to form the Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory. The relocation process alone took several more years. By the end of 1985, after much careful management, the factory produced 50,000 televisions a year, but accumulated a surplus of over 20,000 units, tying up 250 million yuan in capital, and the enterprise fell into another "valley of confusion."

A factory with over 3,000 employees could not afford to be disrupted any further. The provincial authorities decided to appoint Ma Xin, the Party Secretary and Director of the Luonan Huada Radio Factory, as the Director of the Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory.

Upon taking office, Ma Xin quickly addressed the issues, tackled the surplus, and revitalized the market. He formulated a corporate strategy of "comprehensive diplomacy, three-dimensional publicity, focusing on the northwest, breaking through Tongguan, learning from the coastal regions, and going global." He stood behind the counter, visited customers, and gathered information. On the radio, television, and in newspapers, "Ru Yi" televisions frequently appeared. By the end of 1986, the previous year's surplus televisions and the year's production were all sold, and the factory's annual output value exceeded one billion yuan for the first time, turning a stagnant pool into a lively stream.

Ma Xin believed that for an enterprise to take off, it needs two wings: one is extensive publicity to raise awareness; the other is a focus on quality to ensure survival. The latter is the foundation, and without good quality, the more publicity, the more counterproductive it becomes. Therefore, he regarded quality as the lifeblood of the enterprise. Every process in the factory strictly controlled quality. Within three years, the factory was upgraded from a third-level metrology unit to a first-level one.

Ma Xin proposed establishing a corporate culture of "harmony and trust" and fostering a corporate spirit of "all as desired." He implemented a recruitment system and contract system for employees, breaking the "iron chair" and "iron rice bowl," injecting great vitality into the enterprise. Now, the factory produces six series of radio transmitters with over 20 varieties and three series of televisions with 16 varieties, winning 3 national awards and 7 provincial awards. The factory's total output value in 1988 reached 380 million yuan, with taxes and profits amounting to 26.72 million yuan, and export earnings of 10 million US dollars.

At the end of 1988, Ma Xin became the first factory director in Shaanxi's industrial sector to be unanimously elected as a model worker by all employees. In April 1989, the Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory and Ma Xin were awarded "Shaanxi Province's Advanced Reform Unit" and "Outstanding Reformer" by the Provincial Party Committee and Government, respectively. People praised, "This is truly leading the way, with all horses galloping forward!"

    一马当先
　　——记陕西电视设备厂厂长马新
    岳安民
    喜爱看报的同志也许记得，1980年1月17日，《人民日报》头版显著位置刊登了这么一条新闻：《如此折腾怎么搞建设——陕西省有关部门盲目将长城电磁线厂改为拖拉机厂，三易产品型号，造成严重损失》。这就是陕西广播电视设备厂的前身——秦川拖拉机厂当时所受到的尖锐批评。
    这一批评立刻引起强烈反响。省上费尽周折，与电子部协商，将铜川762厂、咸阳彩色电视机厂先后迁入秦川拖拉机厂，合并组建陕西广播电视设备厂。仅拆迁就又折腾了好几年。到1985年末，经过一番苦心经营，一年生产5万台电视机，竟积压了两万多台，占用资金达2500多万元，企业再度陷入“迷谷”。
    3000多人的厂子，再不能折腾下去了。省上决定，调洛南华达无线电厂党委书记兼厂长马新担任陕西广播电视设备厂厂长。
    马新赴任伊始，对症下药，处理积压，搞活流通。他制定出“全方位外交，立体式宣传，立足西北，打出潼关，学习沿海，走向世界”的企业经营战略；他站柜台，访顾客，摸情况。在广播中、电视里、报纸上，“如意”电视不时出现。1986年底，头年积压的电视和当年产品全部销完，全厂年产值首次突破亿元，一潭死水变活了。
    马新认为，企业要腾飞，得有两只翅膀：一是广泛宣传，提高知名度；二是狠抓质量，以质量求生存。前者以后者为根本，质量不好，越宣传越是适得其反。因而，他把质量看作是企业的生命。全厂上下各道工序，严把质量关。三年内，该厂由三级计量单位晋升为一级。
    马新提出在全厂建立“和诚信”的企业文化，树立“皆如意”的企业精神。对干部实行招聘制和聘任制，对新工实行合同制和协议制，搬掉“铁交椅”，砸烂“铁饭碗”，给企业注入极大活力。如今，这个厂生产广播发射机6大系列20多个品种，生产电视机3大系列16个品种，荣获3项国优、7项省优。全厂1988年总产值达3.8亿元，利税达2672万元，出口创汇1000万美元。
    1988年底，马新成为陕西工业战线第一个被全厂职工全票选为劳动模范的优秀厂长。1989年4月，陕西广播电视设备厂和马新被省委、省政府分别授予“陕西省改革先进单位”和“优秀改革者”，人们赞誉道：“这可真是一马当先，万马奔腾啊！”
