Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki's cabinet has been in power for less than a month, and on August 30th, he began his visit to the United States, Mexico, and Canada. For Kaifu, who is making his debut on the international stage as Prime Minister, the visit to the U.S. is the highlight of this trip and is also a routine for every Japanese Prime Minister.

Within half a year, the Japanese cabinet has changed twice, and the Kaifu administration has emerged. Compared to his predecessors, Takeo Bunnaka and Sosuke Uno, the international community knows very little about Kaifu. Increasing his visibility and changing the image of being an "inexperienced diplomat" is one of the main goals of Kaifu's visit to the U.S. To this end, a rich and varied schedule has been carefully arranged, including a summit meeting between the leaders of Japan and the U.S., meetings with prominent American figures, and attending the opening ceremony of a baseball game. The intention is to show the American side that Kaifu is a young, knowledgeable, and intellectually active new leader of Japan.

Like his predecessors, Kaifu also needs to assure the U.S. that his government will maintain the continuity of diplomacy and adhere to the Japan-U.S. relationship as the axis. Given the background of the Liberal Democratic Party losing its majority in the House of Councillors and the uncertain outcome of the House of Representatives election, reaffirming the importance of the "axis" seems to have special significance. Considering the U.S. side's concern about the instability of the Liberal Democratic Party's government, emphasizing the "axis relationship" is intended to imply to the U.S. side: In the context of Japan's turbulent political situation, if the U.S. side exerts pressure on economic friction issues, it will not only affect the stability of the Liberal Democratic Party's government but may ultimately shake the alliance between the two countries.

Regarding the timing of the visit to the U.S., Kaifu seems to have put a lot of thought into it. Starting from September 4th, high-level officials from the economic circles of Japan and the U.S. will gather in Tokyo to hold the first round of Japan-U.S. economic structural consultations. Holding a summit meeting before this will be beneficial in creating a relaxed atmosphere for the consultations. Since the 1960s, when Japan's trade with the U.S. shifted from a deficit to a surplus, the proportion of economic issues in Japan-U.S. summit meetings has been increasing. For many years, the two countries have been arguing over individual products. The U.S. has found that micro-level attacks and defenses have not fundamentally improved economic friction. Now, with a U.S. trade deficit of over $100 billion, the trade deficit with Japan still accounts for more than half, at over $50 billion. Japan and the U.S. are trying to explore solutions to economic friction from a macro perspective, hoping that the structural consultations will provide a good prescription. To avoid the structural consultations turning into a heated argument, Kaifu seeks to set the tone for the consultations through this Japan-U.S. summit meeting and exert influence.

Kaifu's visit to the U.S. also brings some new proposals to demonstrate Japan's active efforts to strengthen Japan-U.S. relations and its commitment to "contributing to the world." Kaifu expressed his intention to propose expanding exchanges between intellectuals of the two countries, increasing mutual understanding through mutual visits and discussions, and easing the recent distrust of the American people towards Japan as an economic power. Kaifu will also propose that Japan bear all the expenses to establish a Japan-U.S. cooperative research institution on global environmental issues. In addition, on international issues such as the accumulated debt of developing countries, Kaifu will also exchange views with the U.S. side, coordinate steps, and seek to increase Japan's voice in international issues within Japan-U.S. cooperation.

The Kaifu cabinet has been in power for a short time, and in the short term, Kaifu's visit aims to break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. economic friction and to seek to consolidate his government through diplomacy. At the same time, coordinating the alliance relationship and seeking new strategies for Japan's diplomacy in the 1990s is also an important goal of Prime Minister Kaifu's visit to the U.S.

    海部访美初试外交
    本报记者　于青
    日本首相海部俊树组阁还未满月，8月30日开始出访美国、墨西哥和加拿大三国。对于就任首相后在外交舞台初试身手的海部，访美是此行的重头戏，也是历届日本首相的“例行公事”。
    半年之中，日本内阁两度更迭，海部政权应运而生。与前首相竹下和宇野相比，国际社会对海部知之甚少。提高知名度，改变“外交外行”的形象，是海部访美之行的主要目的之一。为此精心安排了日美首脑会谈、与美国知名人士接触、参加棒球比赛开幕式等丰富多彩的日程，意在向美国方面表明，海部是日本年轻、知识型、思想活跃的新领导人。
    同前任首相一样，海部也要向美国保证，本届政府将保持外交的连续性，坚持以日美关系为基轴。因为在参院自民党失去多数议席，众院选举胜负难卜的背景下，重申“基轴”的重要性似乎具有特殊意义。考虑到美国方面对自民党政权不稳的担心，强调“基轴关系”，意在暗示美国方面：在日本政局动荡不安的形势下，美国方面在经济摩擦问题上施加压力，不仅影响自民党政权的稳定，最终可能会动摇两国同盟关系。
    对于访美时机的选择，海部似乎费了一番心机。9月4日开始，日美两国经济界高层人士将聚首东京，举行第一轮日美经济结构协商。在此之前举行首脑会谈，有利于为协商制造缓和的气氛。自60年代日本对美贸易由逆差转为顺差以来，经济话题在日美首脑会谈中的比重日趋增加。多年来，两国一直围绕个别产品争论不休。美国发现，在微观上攻守角逐，经济摩擦未取得根本改观。现在高达1000亿美元的美国对外贸易逆差中，对日贸易逆差仍占500多亿美元的半数之多。日美试从宏观角度探讨解决经济摩擦途径，期待结构协商能开出良方。为避免结构协商重演面红耳赤的场面，能够平心静气地对话，海部力求此次日美首脑会谈为结构协商确定基调，施加影响。
    海部访美，还带去一些新建议，以表现日本积极加强日美关系和致力于“为世界作贡献”的姿态。海部表示将提议扩大日美知识界人士的交流、通过互访和讨论增进相互了解，以缓解近来美国人把经济大国日本视为最大威胁的不信任情绪。海部还将提议由日本负担全部经费，建立有关地球环境问题的日美合作研究机构。除此之外，在发展中国家的累积债务等国际问题上，海部也将与美国方面交换意见，协调步伐，寻求在日美合作中，增加日本对国际问题的发言权。
    海部内阁成立时日尚短，从近期着眼，海部出访意在打开日美经济摩擦僵局，并想通过外交得到巩固政权。同时，协调同盟关系，为90年代日本外交寻求新的策略，也是海部首相访美的重要目标。
