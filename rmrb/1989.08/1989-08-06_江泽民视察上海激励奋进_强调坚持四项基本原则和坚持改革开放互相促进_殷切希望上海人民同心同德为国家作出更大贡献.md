    Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, emphasized during his inspection of Shanghai that adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and persisting with reform and opening up are mutually reinforcing and complementary. This historical lesson, bought with blood, must never be forgotten. He sincerely hopes that the people of Shanghai will unite and work together to resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization, take bigger and faster steps in reform and opening up, and strive to boost economic development, making greater contributions to the country.

    From August 2 to 6, Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji, and Deputy Party Secretaries Huang Ju, Wu Bangguo, and Chen Zili, visited various grassroots levels. He met with workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres from different sectors, and personally comforted steelworkers and textile workers on the production frontline. He also met with Shanghai's party, government, and military leaders, as well as some veteran comrades. He expressed his deep gratitude to the people of Shanghai for their support and assistance during his stay in Shanghai and spoke about studying and implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Deng Xiaoping's important speeches, firmly adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, opposing bourgeois liberalization, and furthering reform and opening up.

    During his talks with various sectors in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed the need to fully implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" established by the Thirteenth Party Congress. He said that adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles is the foundation of the state, while reform and opening up is the path to strength. The two are complementary and mutually reinforcing. He urged Shanghai comrades to free their minds and take bigger and faster steps in reform and opening up.

    Jiang Zemin said that Shanghai, as the largest industrial city and economic center in the country, and an important international port, should and has the conditions to achieve new results in expanding reform and opening up. Shanghai has great potential in this regard, with many opportunities to make a difference and much hope for the future.

    Jiang Zemin pointed out that in the process of opening up to the outside world, we must strive to learn and borrow advanced science and technology and successful management experiences from foreign countries, and bring in everything beneficial to our modernization drive. At the same time, we must guard against the infiltration of decadent capitalist ideology.

    Jiang Zemin urged Shanghai to invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises through deepening reforms. He said that large and medium-sized enterprises play a leading role in the national economy. If they are revitalized, their backbone role in economic construction can be fully played, and there is hope for economic development.

    During his inspection of rural areas, Jiang Zemin talked with county officials and stressed the need to firmly establish the guiding ideology of "agriculture as the foundation." He said that China has limited land and a large population, and land is precious. We must strive to ensure that no arable land is abandoned, using legal means to protect arable land; and we must do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area and the output of land. On this basis, we should develop township and village enterprises in a step-by-step manner.

    During his stay in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin met with leaders of the garrison troops and the Armed Police Corps, visited the soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company" on Nanjing Road, and called on everyone to learn from the revolutionary spirit of hard work and the noble character of "resisting corruption and never being tainted" of the "Good Eighth Company." He also attended the Shanghai Public Security and Armed Police Summary and Commendation Conference for suppressing the turmoil, and awarded prizes to public security officers and armed police soldiers who had made outstanding contributions.

    江泽民视察上海激励奋进
    强调坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放互相促进
    殷切希望上海人民同心同德为国家作出更大贡献
    新华社上海8月6日电　（记者陈毛弟）中共中央总书记江泽民视察上海时强调指出，坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放，两者相辅相成，互相促进。这个用血换来的历史经验教训，在任何时候都不能忘记。他殷切希望上海人民同心同德，团结一致，切实进行反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，迈出改革开放的更大步伐，千方百计把经济建设搞上去，为国家作出更大的贡献。
    8月2日至6日，江泽民同志由上海市委书记、市长朱镕基和市委副书记黄菊、吴邦国、陈至立等分别陪同，深入基层，同工人、农民、知识分子和干部等各界人士广泛接触座谈，亲切慰问在生产第一线挥汗劳动的炼钢、纺织工人。他还会见了上海市党政军负责同志和部分老同志，深切感谢上海人民对他在上海期间工作的支持和帮助，并就学习贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志的多次重要讲话，认真坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化和进一步改革开放等问题讲了话。
    江泽民同志在与上海各界人士谈话中，反复强调要全面贯彻执行党的十三大确定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线。他说，坚持四项基本原则是立国之本，坚持改革开放是强国之路，两者相辅相成，互相促进。他要求上海同志解放思想，把改革开放的步伐迈得更大、更快些。
    江泽民说，上海是全国最大的工业城市和经济中心，也是一个重要的国际港口，完全应该也有条件在扩大改革开放方面做出新成绩。上海在这方面的潜力很大，有许多文章可做，是大有可为、大有希望的。
    江泽民指出，在对外开放中，既要努力学习和借鉴外国先进科学技术和成功的管理经验，把一切有利于我国“四化”建设的好东西学过来，又要注意抵制资本主义腐朽没落的思想侵蚀。
    江泽民要求上海通过深化改革，进一步增强大中型企业的活力。他说，大中型企业在国民经济中占主导地位，大中型企业搞活了，它们在经济建设中的骨干作用可以得到充分发挥，经济搞上去就有希望。
    江泽民同志在农村调查，同郊县干部谈话时，要求大家牢固树立“以农业为基础”的指导思想。他说，我国地少人多，土地宝贵，要努力做到一不撂荒耕地，用法制手段保护好耕地；二要千方百计提高单位面积产量，提高土地产出率。在这个基础上，有步骤地发展乡镇工业。
    江泽民同志在上海期间，会见了驻沪部队和武警总队负责同志，看望了“南京路上好八连”指战员，号召大家学习“好八连”艰苦奋斗的革命精神和“拒腐蚀，永不沾”的高尚情操。他还参加了上海市公安、武警制止动乱总结表彰大会，向立功的公安干警和武警指战员授了奖。
