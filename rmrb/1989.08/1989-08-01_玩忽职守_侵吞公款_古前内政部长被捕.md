	Negligence of Duty and Embezzlement of Public Funds:
	Former Cuban Interior Minister Arrested

	Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 31

	The Cuban newspaper "Granma" reported today that former Cuban Interior Minister Jose Abranetes was detained for negligence of duty and illegal appropriation and embezzlement of public funds.

	At the same time, the following individuals were also arrested: Immigration Director Carenio Gomez, Customs Director Castaneda Isquiedo, the head of a company under the Interior Ministry, Cavonell Mendes, and General Roberto Gonzalez.

	The decision was announced in an official communiqué issued by the Cuban Communist Party's leadership committee today. The communiqué stated that based on the investigation results of the drug trafficking case involving officials from the armed forces and the Interior Ministry, there were illegal and disorderly behaviors within the leadership of the Interior Ministry. To maintain discipline, the leadership committee decided to detain them.

	Abranetes took office as the Interior Minister in 1985 and had been considered one of the key figures in Cuban politics in recent years. He was dismissed after the government exposed the involvement of some military and Interior Ministry officials in international drug trafficking on June 12. The main participants in the drug trafficking, General Ochoa and four other high-ranking military officers, were executed on July 13.

	At the same time as the former Interior Minister was arrested, five generals were demoted and ordered to retire from active duty.

    玩忽职守  侵吞公款
    古前内政部长被捕
    新华社哈瓦那7月31日电　古巴《格拉玛报》今天报道，古巴前内政部长何塞·阿夫兰特斯因玩忽职守和非法挪用与侵吞公款等罪行而被拘留。
    同时被捕的还有移民局长卡雷尼奥·戈麦斯、海关总署署长卡斯塔涅达·伊斯基耶多、内政部下属的一家公司的负责人卡沃内尔·门德斯以及罗伯托·冈萨雷斯将军。
    上述决定是古共领导委员会在今天发表的一份官方公报中宣布的。公报说，根据对武装部队和内政部官员的毒品走私案的调查结果，内政部领导层存在着违法乱纪的行为。为了严肃纪律，古共领导委员会决定将他们收审。
    阿夫兰特斯是于1985年出任内政部长的，近年来一直被认为是古巴政界要人之一。他于政府6月12日揭露军方和内政部一些人参与国际贩毒事件后被解职。贩毒主要参与者奥乔亚将军和另外4名高级军官于7月13日被处决。
    这次在前内政部长被捕同时，5名将级军官受到降级处分并被勒令退出现役。
