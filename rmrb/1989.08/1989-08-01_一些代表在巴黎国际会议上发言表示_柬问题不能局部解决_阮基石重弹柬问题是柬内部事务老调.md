Some representatives at the Paris International Conference on Cambodia stated that the Cambodian issue cannot be resolved locally. Nguyen Co Hoi repeatedly emphasized the old tune that the Cambodian issue is an internal matter.

Our reporter, Zhang Qihua and Lü Wangda, reported from Paris on August 1st: The Paris International Conference on Cambodia continued its plenary session yesterday. Foreign ministers from Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, and Vietnam, as well as representatives from the Democratic Kampuchea, Son Sann and Khieu Samphan, delivered speeches at the conference.

Thailand's Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila pointed out that the so-called "partial resolution" plan cannot be accepted, and a comprehensive political resolution plan is needed to fundamentally solve the Cambodian issue. He proposed that the conference should focus on solving the following problems: first, there should be a comprehensive political resolution plan that includes all aspects of the Cambodian issue; second, the issue of national reconciliation must also be resolved, and efforts should be made to establish a four-party interim coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk, under the supervision of the United Nations, and to organize national elections at an appropriate time; third, an international supervision mechanism should be established, and only the United Nations has the authority and experience to complete this task.

Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar said that within the framework of a comprehensive political resolution to the Cambodian issue, the first step is to withdraw foreign troops. ASEAN countries have stated their position at the UN General Assembly every year, and our current efforts are to ensure lasting peace and stability in Cambodia. After the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, peace was not achieved, and conflicts continued. We cannot repeat the historical mistakes in Cambodia.

Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans believed that if this conference does not simultaneously resolve the internal and external issues of Cambodia, does not comprehensively resolve the problem, and abandons its responsibilities, it can only prolong the war in Cambodia and the suffering of its people.

Japan's Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata pointed out that there are many obstacles to achieving peace in Cambodia, and temporary and unstable so-called ceasefires cannot be adopted. Only through a comprehensive political resolution can the Cambodian issue be fundamentally resolved. The withdrawal of Vietnamese troops should be carried out under effective international supervision, and the ultimate goal is to seek a comprehensive political resolution plan.

Prime Minister Son Sann of the Democratic Kampuchea government fully supported Prince Sihanouk's statement on resolving the Cambodian issue. He pointed out that Vietnam is strenuously advocating that the Cambodian issue is an internal issue. If the issue of internal reconciliation in Cambodia is avoided, Cambodia will not have lasting peace, and it will create the roots of instability.

He believed that the prospects for resolving the Cambodian issue are only two: either leading to civil war, or establishing a four-party interim coalition government as proposed by Prince Sihanouk, uniting all Cambodians, under the supervision of the United Nations and peacekeeping forces, preventing anyone from seizing power by force, and truly realizing the people's right to self-determination.

Vice Chairman Khieu Samphan of the Democratic Kampuchea government stated that the Cambodian issue essentially has only one aspect, which is the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia. The Phnom Penh regime is the result of Vietnamese occupation. We suggest that the international supervision organization must ensure the control and inspection of the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops invading Cambodia, including Vietnamese military personnel hiding in the Cambodian puppet regime and all stored weapons. He said that Prince Sihanouk's peace plan is a comprehensive plan to resolve the Cambodian issue, which has made significant concessions.

Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Hoi repeatedly used the Cambodian internal affairs as an excuse to oppose international involvement. He believed that there are three plans to resolve the Cambodian issue: first, to recognize it as an internal affair of Cambodia; second, in the event that all parties cannot reach a consensus, the conference makes a decision to impose a Cambodian interim coalition government; third, the conference should create conditions to establish a temporary institution, not interfere with its work, not favor any side, and abide by the agreements of all parties. Foreign countries, especially neighboring countries, should not support one side to attack another, and should abide by the long-term neutrality principle of Cambodia. Nguyen Co Hoi clearly expressed his support for the first plan.

    一些代表在巴黎国际会议上发言表示
    柬问题不能局部解决
    阮基石重弹柬问题是柬内部事务老调
    本报巴黎8月1日电　记者张启华、吕网大报道：柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议昨天继续举行大会，泰国、日本、马来西亚、澳大利亚及越南等国外长、民主柬埔寨代表宋双、乔森潘先后在大会上发了言。
    泰国外长西提指出，不能接受所谓“局部解决”的方案，而需要一个全面从根本上解决柬埔寨问题的政治解决方案。他提出，会议应着重解决以下几个问题：一是要有一个全面政治解决的方案，应包括柬埔寨问题的各个方面；二是民族和解问题也要解决，要推动成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，在联合国监督下，在适当时候组织全国大选；三是建立国际监督机制，只有联合国最有权威与经验完成这个任务。
    马来西亚外长奥马尔说，在全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的范围内，首先要撤出外国军队。东盟国家每年在联大会议上都表明它的立场，我们现在所做的努力就是要保证柬埔寨持久的和平和稳定。阿富汗撤军之后，并没有实现和平，冲突反而在继续，我们不能在柬埔寨重复历史的错误。
    澳大利亚外长埃文斯认为，这次会议如果不是同时解决柬埔寨内部外部问题，不是全面解决问题，放弃自己的责任，那就只能延长柬埔寨战争和人民的痛苦。
    日本外相三塚指出，在柬埔寨实现和平存在许多障碍，不能采取临时的不稳定的所谓停火，只能通过全面政治解决才能根本解决柬埔寨问题。越南撤军应在有效的国际监督下进行，最后目标是寻求一个全面政治解决的方案。
    民柬政府总理宋双在发言中，完全支持西哈努克亲王关于解决柬埔寨问题的声明。他指出，越南竭力宣扬柬埔寨问题是内部问题。如果回避柬埔寨内部的和解问题，柬埔寨就不可能有持久的和平，会造成不安定的祸根。
    他认为，柬埔寨问题的解决前景无非两条，一是最后导致内战；一是在西哈努克亲王提出的建立四方临时联合政府，团结所有的柬埔寨人，在联合国和维持和平部队的监督下，防止任何人用武力掌握政权，真正实现人民的自决权利。
    民柬副主席乔森潘发言说，柬埔寨问题实质上只有一个方面，那就是越南对柬埔寨的侵略和占领，金边政权只是越南占领造成的结果。我们建议国际监督机构必须保证控制及检查所有侵柬越军的撤退，包括潜藏在柬伪的越南军事人员及所有贮存的武器。他说，西哈努克亲王的和平计划是一个全面解决柬埔寨问题的方案，已经作了很大的让步。
    越南外长阮基石在发言中一再以柬埔寨内政问题为由，反对国际社会的参与。他认为解决柬埔寨问题有三个方案，一是承认这是柬埔寨的内部事务；二是在各方达不成和解的情况下由大会作出强加于人的建立柬埔寨临时联合政府的决定；三是会议要创造条件，建立临时机构，不干预它的工作，不倾向哪一方，遵守几方的协议，外国特别是邻国不要支持一方打击一方，要遵守柬埔寨长期的中立原则。阮基石明确表示赞同第一个方案。
