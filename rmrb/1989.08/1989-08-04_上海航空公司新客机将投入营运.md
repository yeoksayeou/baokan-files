Shanghai Airlines, the first domestic trunk airline in China to operate independently, has procured three Boeing 757-200 aircraft from the United States through a joint investment scheme. The first aircraft arrived in Shanghai recently and is scheduled to commence operations on August 15. The other two aircraft will also arrive in Shanghai shortly.

Since its establishment in December 1985, Shanghai Airlines has adhered to the principles of "safety first, passengers foremost, and quality service." The company's business has been continuously expanding. Given that the previously introduced 707 aircraft are now outdated, the company decided to upgrade its fleet.

In July 1988, Shanghai Airlines placed an order with Boeing Commercial Airplanes for three new 757 aircraft.

    上海航空公司新客机将投入营运
    本报上海电  我国第一家自主经营国内干线的地方航空公司——上海航空公司采取集资形式，从美国引进3架波音757—200型新客机。第一架日前抵沪，拟在8月15日开始营运，另两架不久也将抵沪。
    上海航空公司自1985年12月成立后，坚持“安全第一、旅客至上、优质服务”的方针，业务不断拓展。公司鉴于原来引进的707飞机已属老龄型，决定更新飞机。
    1988年7月，他们向美国波音民用飞机公司订购了3架757新型客机。
