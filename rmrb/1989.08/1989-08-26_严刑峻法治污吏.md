Title: Severe Laws to Punish Corrupt Officials

The story of Zhuge Liang weeping as he beheaded Ma Su and demoted himself three ranks, reflecting on his own "leniency in handling affairs" and "inappropriate appointments," is a brilliant example of his strict adherence to the law and his self-discipline.

Zhuge Liang's principles of governing the military and the country were "rule by law and clear rewards and punishments." This means he advocated for strict enforcement of the law. The legal code of Shu, known as the "Shu Ke," and his personal works such as "Fa Jian," "Ke Ling," and "Jun Ling," provided a legal framework for the entire Shu kingdom. The regulations within, such as the "Eight Duties," "Seven Taboos," "Six Fears," and "Five Dreads," primarily aimed to ensure that officials at all levels were honest, diligent, and loyal to their duties, preventing corruption.

This approach was not unique to Zhuge Liang; many wise rulers and officials in Chinese history followed similar governance principles. The "Great Tang Edicts and Orders," a collection of nearly 300,000 characters, includes thirty edicts, with corrupt officials often being excluded from amnesty. For example, the "Edict of the Second Month of the Fourth Year of Zhenguan" clearly stipulates that those who accept bribes and pervert justice are not to be pardoned. The penalties for corrupt officials were severe. According to the "Tang Code with Commentaries," officials who accept bribes and pervert justice face severe punishments. Accepting a bribe of one foot of cloth results in one hundred strokes with a heavy rod; accepting a bribe of one roll of cloth results in an increased penalty; accepting a bribe of fifteen rolls of cloth results in the death penalty. According to the "Zizhi Tongjian," during the Zhenguan period, the Governor of Guangzhou, Pang Renhong, acted arbitrarily and amassed over one million in illicit gains. He was impeached, and despite the efforts of the Tang Taizong to intervene on his behalf, Pang was executed according to the law. Tang Taizong even criticized himself for his actions. The Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang detested corrupt officials and punished them severely. "If local officials accept bribes, the people are allowed to report it. If the bribe amounts to sixty taels or more, the official's head will be displayed publicly, and his skin will be stuffed with grass." At the time, the tea prohibition was strict, and the Prince Consort, Ouyang Lun, felt he had the backing to act with impunity. He repeatedly sent people to smuggle tea out of the country for profit, and even high-ranking officials dared not question his illegal actions. When Zhu Yuanzhang heard about this, he was furious and had Ouyang Lun "executed for smuggling." Even Empress Ma's pleading was to no avail.

    严刑峻法治污吏
    诸葛亮挥泪斩马谡上疏自贬三级，检讨自己“恤事多闇”“授任无方”，是他率先执法、严于律己的精采一例。
    诸葛亮的治军治国之道是“行法治，明赏罚”，也就是主张执法必严，他主持制订的蜀国法典《蜀科》和他亲著的《法检》、《科令》、《军令》等，使蜀国上下有法可依。其中的“八务”，“七戒”、“六恐”、“五惧”等条规，主要是规范文臣武将和各级官吏廉洁奉公、忠于职守，防止腐败的。
    其实这不独是诸葛亮的治国之道，我国历史上的明君贤臣几乎无不厉行此种治国之道，一部近几十万字的《大唐诏令集》，计有赦令三十条，而贪官污吏常属不赦之列。如《贞观四年二月大赦》中明确规定不赦“官人枉法受财”的罪犯。对赃官在律刑上规定也很严厉。据《唐律疏义》诸监临、主司受财而枉法者，如果接受一尺布的贿赂，处杖刑一百；数量达到一匹，量刑加一等；受贿布匹达十五匹者，即处以绞刑。据《资治通鉴》记载，贞观年间广州都督党仁弘恣意妄为，“赃百余万”，被人弹劾，大理寺办案官员硬是驳了唐太宗为其说情的面子，党仁弘终于依法被诛，为此唐太宗还作了自我批评。明太祖朱元璋对贪官污吏深恶痛绝，总是严惩不贷。“凡守令贪赃，许人民陈诉，赃至六十两上，枭首示众，仍剥皮囊草。”当时茶禁方严，附马欧阳伦自觉有恃无恐，私下屡屡派人贩茶出境以牟暴利，连封疆大吏都不敢过问他的违法行为。朱元璋闻言大怒，将欧阳伦“以私贩论死”，马皇后苦苦求情也白搭。
