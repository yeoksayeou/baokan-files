The impoverished and backward region of northern Jiangsu, plagued by frequent waterlogging disasters, has witnessed a monumental struggle against water over the past 40 years since the founding of New China. This struggle has achieved the remarkable feat of constructing a new water system for flood control, irrigation, and drainage, transforming the landscape of northern Jiangsu. The long-held aspiration of the people—"leading the Dragon King by the hand"—has finally become a reality.

Northern Jiangsu is situated at the downstream of the five major rivers: the Yangtze, Huai, Yi, Shu, and Si. The region is low-lying and has long been known as the "flood corridor." Among various natural disasters, floods have been the most devastating. Concentrating efforts to first control the floods of the Yi and Shu Rivers was the first major battle in the struggle against water in northern Jiangsu.

The ancient Yi and Shu Rivers flow through the southern and northern parts of the Yimeng Mountains in Shandong, meandering through the Huai River Plain in Jiangsu before emptying into the sea. With short and rapid flows, these rivers can flood suddenly, causing extensive damage. After years of treatment, the banks of the Yi and Shu Rivers are now dotted with reservoirs and pumping stations, which have tamed the once-raging waters. The rivers now flow according to human will, irrigating the fertile lands on both sides. Huaiyin City, which once relied on grain supply, has seen its grain production rank first in Jiangsu for many consecutive years.

The large-scale treatment of the Huai River in northern Jiangsu was the second major battle in the struggle against water. From the winter of 1951 to the spring of 1952, a 160-kilometer-long North Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal was opened, connecting the Huai River with the Yellow Sea. This canal serves as a passage for the Huai River to flow into the sea and can also irrigate millions of acres of farmland along its route. The once-unruly Huai River has begun to serve the people. After the excavation of the North Jiangsu Irrigation Main Canal, the dikes of Hongze Lake were reinforced, and a control gate and a ship lock were built at the southern end of the dikes at Sanhekou. This controls the water level of Hongze Lake, connects the Grand Canal and the Huai River for navigation, and has built the Huai River's entrance to the Yangtze River. This has achieved flood control and drainage for over a million acres of farmland in the Baihe Lake and Baoying Lake regions, and has fully controlled the entrance of the Huai River to the Yangtze River. The people of northern Jiangsu have used their own hands to tame the dragon, ending the tragic history of being ravaged by Huai River floods. By 1974, the 5 million acres of single-crop paddy fields in the disaster-prone and low-yielding Lixiahe region had been basically transformed into double-crop water and dry rotation fields. Grain production has continuously reached new heights, making it one of the important commercial grain bases in Jiangsu.

In the 1960s, the struggle against water in northern Jiangsu entered a new stage, breaking through the boundaries of river basins and conducting inter-basin water transfer and treatment. A large amount of water from the Huai and Yangtze Rivers, which previously flowed wastefully into the Yangtze River and the sea, was diverted to the water-scarce Xuhuai region to prevent waterlogging and drought, achieving stable yields regardless of drought or flood. The first battle in inter-basin water transfer and treatment was the northward diversion of Huai River water. Between the Huai River and the Yi River, an inter-basin water transfer was conducted, opening a 196-kilometer-long new Huai-Shu River. This waterway was completed in the 1970s, diverting river and lake water northward to supply industrial and agricultural production needs, and also allowing the Huai River and Yi-Shu-Si Rivers to complement each other.

The second battle in inter-basin water transfer and treatment was the northward diversion of the Yangtze River water. Through the Jiangdu Water Hub project, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu was used as the main waterway, with multi-stage pumping northward, connecting Hongze Lake, Luoma Lake, and other lakes and reservoirs for inter-basin regulation. By 1985, a water transfer project system had been basically formed. Due to the implementation of the Yangtze River northward diversion project, the rice planting area in the Xuhuai region has stabilized and developed from over 2 million acres to about 10 million acres, becoming a key grain and cotton production area in the country. Today, northern Jiangsu is crisscrossed by rivers and canals, with boats visible in the distance. In summer, the wheat waves roll, and in autumn, the rice fields are fragrant, and the cotton fields are silver. The landscape is beautiful.

    牵着“龙王”走
    贫穷、落后、水涝灾害频繁的苏北地区，新中国成立40年来，进行了波澜壮阔的治水斗争，取得了全面建成防洪灌溉排涝新水系的巨大成就，使苏北大地发生了翻天覆地的变化。人民群众多年来的美好愿望——“牵着龙王走”，终于变成了现实。
    苏北地处江、淮、沂、沭、泗五大河流下游，地势低洼，历来是“洪水走廊”，在各种自然灾害中，以洪水为害最烈。集中力量先把沂河、沭河的洪水控制住，是苏北治水斗争的第一战役。
    古老的沂河、沭河，纵穿山东沂蒙山区南北，经江苏淮北平原漫流入海，源短流急，一发洪水，来时一闪电，一淹一大片。经过多年的整治，沂沭河两岸拦洪蓄水库和抽水站星罗棋布，滔滔沂沭河按照人们意志，用自己甜美的流水灌溉着两岸肥沃的土地，吃粮靠供销的淮阴市，粮食总产连续多年居江苏第一位。
    苏北大地上大规模治理淮河，是苏北治水斗争的第二大战役。1951年冬至1952年春，新开了一条160公里长的苏北灌溉总渠，西起洪泽湖，东至黄海，把淮河和黄海连接起来，成为淮水入海的通道，并能引洪泽湖水灌溉沿线数百万亩农田，放荡无羁的淮河，开始为人民谋福利。在开挖苏北灌溉总渠后，又加固了洪泽湖大堤，在大堤南端三河口兴建了节制闸和船闸，控制洪泽湖水位，沟通运河和淮河的航运，兴修了淮河入江水道，使白马湖、宝应湖地区100多万亩农田实现了洪涝分治，淮河入江门口全面得到控制。苏北人民用自己的双手缚住苍龙，结束了被淮河洪水肆意吞噬的悲惨历史。到1974年，多灾低产的里下河地区500万亩一熟沤田，基本上改造成稻麦两熟的水旱轮作田，粮食生产不断登上新台阶，成为江苏重要的商品粮基地之一。
    进入60年代，苏北治水斗争开始了一个新的阶段，突破了流域界限，进行跨流域调水治理。把大量的白白流入大江、大海的淮水和江水，调到缺乏水源的徐淮地区，为农业除涝治旱，做到旱涝保收。流域调水治理的第一仗是淮水北调。在淮河和沂河之间进行跨流域调水，从洪泽湖至连云港市，新开一条长196公里的淮沭新河。这条河道已于70年代建成，把河水和湖水向北调送，供应工农业生产需要，还使淮水和沂沭泗水互调互济。
    流域调水治理的第二仗是长江水北调。经江都水利枢纽工程，利用京杭运河苏北段作为输水干河，多级提水北上，串联洪泽湖、骆马湖等湖泊水库，跨流域进行调节。到1985年，已基本形成调水工程系统。由于江水北调工程的实施，徐淮地区水稻面积从200多万亩稳定发展到1000万亩左右，成为全国重点粮棉产区。如今苏北大地，河渠纵横，船帆隐现，夏季麦浪滚滚，秋季稻谷飘香、棉海缀银，一派秀丽景色。　丁峰　旭东
