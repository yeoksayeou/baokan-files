Dear Editor,

In recent years, with the adjustment of rural industrial structures, many farmers have moved to cities to work and do business. Most of these individual business owners have shifted from "nomadic" operations to fixed-point operations, gradually becoming de facto urban residents.

However, many places have overlooked a problem: Party members who move to cities to work and do business, due to their long-term absence from their hometowns, although some Party organizations have the desire to strengthen their contact, due to the barriers of time and space, their management is "beyond reach." The individual business associations, industrial and commercial departments, and local Party organizations, due to lack of clear responsibilities, lack management, and the original Party member education content lacks pertinence, some of which are no longer suitable for the new era's requirements, resulting in individual business owner Party members not receiving Party organization education, supervision, and assistance for a long time. Some Party members have not participated in organizational life for a long time, have not paid membership dues, and some have gone astray, gradually forgetting that they are Communist Party members.

Therefore, it is suggested that Party organizations at all levels should, in combination with local realities, adopt various forms to strengthen Party organization building and improve Party life systems among individual business owners, and put the Party class education of individual business owner Party members on the agenda, so as to fully mobilize their enthusiasm.

### 对个体户党员要加强管理

    对个体户党员要加强管理编辑同志：
    近年来，随着农村产业结构的调整，不少农民进城务工经商。这些个体户大多数已由“游牧式”经营转向定点经营，逐渐成为事实上的城市常住户口。
    但是，不少地方却忽视了一个问题：进城务工经商的党员，由于长期离开乡土，有些党组织虽有加强同他们联系的愿望，然而，由于时间、空间的阻隔，对他们的管理“鞭长莫及”；个体协会、工商部门及当地党组织由于没有明确职责，缺乏管理，加之原有的党员教育的内容缺乏针对性，有的已不适应新时期的要求，致使个体户党员长期得不到党组织的教育、监督和帮助。一些党员长期不过组织生活，没有交纳党费，有的放任自流，逐渐忘了自己是一名共产党员。
    因此，建议各级党组织应结合当地实际，采取多种形式，在个体户中加强党组织建设和健全党内生活制度，把个体户党员的党课教育提到议事日程上来，以充分发挥他们的积极性。
