	Shizuishan Establishes Labor Dispute Mediation Committee to Protect Workers' Rights

	According to a report from our newspaper, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's Shizuishan City has been actively utilizing the labor dispute mediation role of enterprise trade unions to protect the legal rights of enterprise employees.

	Over the past year, 204 state-owned enterprises in Shizuishan City have successively established labor dispute mediation organizations, with a total of over 400 mediators. Since their establishment, these organizations have actively protected workers' legal rights. A worker at the First Factory of the Northwest Coal Mining Machinery General Factory violated labor discipline, and the factory decided to dismiss him. The mediation committee believed that he had the potential to be reformed, and after guidance, the young man "reformed" and became a key figure in production. A worker at the Electric Motor Factory of the same general factory had a recurrence of high blood pressure during a business trip, resulting in hemiplegia. The worker requested to be treated as a work-related injury, while the factory planned to handle it as a regular illness and labor insurance matter. The dispute was later resolved satisfactorily through the mediation of the factory's mediation committee.

    石嘴山维护工人权益成立劳动争议调委会
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区石嘴山市积极发挥企业工会的劳动争议调解作用，维护了企业职工的合法权益。
    去年以来，石嘴山市204个全民企业中相继成立了劳动争议调解组织，调解人员达400多人。这些组织成立以来，积极维护工人的合法权益。西北煤矿机械总厂一厂一名工人违犯劳动纪律，厂里决定开除他，调委会认为他有教育好的可能，经帮教这个青年“浪子回头”，成了生产中的骨干。该总厂电机厂一名工人出差时高血压病复发造成半身不遂，本人要求按工伤处理，厂方拟按病伤和劳保对待，双方发生争议，后经厂调委会调解得到妥善处理。　（赵玉文）
