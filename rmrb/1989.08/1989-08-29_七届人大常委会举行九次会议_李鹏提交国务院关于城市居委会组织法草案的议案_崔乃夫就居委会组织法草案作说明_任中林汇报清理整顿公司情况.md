The ninth session of the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee began today at the Great Hall of the People.

Wan Li, the Chairman, presided over the meeting.

At the start of the meeting, Peng Chong, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General, explained the draft agenda for this session. The delegates approved this agenda.

Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, submitted to the Seventh NPC Standing Committee a proposal from the State Council to consider the draft of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Urban Residents' Committees. The proposal stated that this law is intended to ensure that urban residents can exercise self-governance, handle their own affairs in accordance with the law, develop socialist democracy at the grassroots level in cities, and promote the material and spiritual civilization of cities. The NPC Standing Committee decided to include the consideration of this proposal in the agenda for this session.

At today's meeting, Cui Naifu, Minister of Civil Affairs, was entrusted by the State Council to explain the draft of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Urban Residents' Committees. Cui Naifu mentioned in his explanation that the draft of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Urban Residents' Committees was drafted in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, in combination with the current situation in China's cities, and also with reference to the basic spirit of the Provisional Regulations on the Organization of Village Committees. The purpose is to make the new law suitable for the new situation in China's cities today, and to truly build the residents' committees into grassroots self-governing organizations that fully embody democracy, adhere to the mass line, and are managed, educated, and served by the masses themselves.

On behalf of the State Council, Ren Zhonglin, Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, reported to the meeting on the situation of cleaning up and rectifying companies. He said that companies are an indispensable economic organizational form for the development of socialist commodity economy, and the establishment and development of companies have played a positive role in promoting production and activating circulation. However, in recent years, the excessive and disorderly development of companies has disrupted the economic order, exacerbated social inequity, interfered with clean governance, and affected social stability. To promote the healthy development of socialist planned commodity economy and ensure the smooth progress of the reform and opening-up and socialist modernization, it is necessary to seriously clean up and rectify various types of companies.

Ren Zhonglin said that cleaning up and rectifying companies is not about not establishing companies or denying the positive role of companies in economic life. Instead, it is to solve the problems existing in the operation and development of companies, change the current chaotic situation, and facilitate better implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, revitalize the economy, and develop the economy.

Vice Chairpersons Xi Zhongxun, Zhu Lirong, Yan Jizhi, Rong Yiren, Ye Fei, Liao Hansheng, Ni Zhifu, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, and Wang Hanbin attended the meeting.

State Councilor Song Jian, President of the Supreme People's Court Zhang Jianxin, and Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Liu Fuzhi attended the meeting as non-voting participants.

In the afternoon, the delegates held group discussions.

    新华社北京8月29日电　七届全国人大常委会第九次会议今起在人民大会堂举行。
    万里委员长主持会议。
    会议开始时，副委员长兼秘书长彭冲首先就这次会议的议程草案作了说明，委员们通过了这个议程。
    国务院总理李鹏向七届全国人大常委会提交了国务院关于提请审议中华人民共和国城市居民委员会组织法草案的议案。议案中说，制定这部法律是为了保障城市居民实行自治，由城市居民群众依法办理自己的事情，发展城市基层社会主义民主，推动城市社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设。全国人大常委会决定把审议这个议案列入本次常委会议的议程。
    在今天的会议上，民政部部长崔乃夫受国务院委托，就城市居民委员会组织法草案作了说明。崔乃夫在说明中谈到，城市居民委员会组织法草案是根据宪法的规定，结合目前我国城市的实际情况，同时参照村民委员会组织法（试行）的基本精神起草的。目的是使新的法律适合目前我国城市新的情况，真正把居民委员会建设成为充分发扬民主，坚持群众路线，由群众进行自我管理、自我教育、自我服务的基层群众性自治组织。
    受国务院委托，国家工商行政管理局局长任中林向会议作了关于清理整顿公司情况的汇报。他在汇报中说，公司是发展社会主义商品经济必不可少的经济组织形式，公司的建立和发展对于促进生产、活跃流通起到了积极的作用。但近几年公司发展过多过滥，扰乱了经济秩序，加剧了社会分配不公，干扰了为政清廉，影响了社会安定。为了促进社会主义有计划商品经济的健康发展，保证改革开放事业和社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行，必须对各类公司进行认真的清理整顿。
    任中林说，清理整顿公司，不是不要办公司，也不是否定公司在经济生活中的积极作用，而是为了解决公司经营和发展中存在的问题，改变目前的混乱状况，以利于更好地贯彻改革开放的方针，搞活经济，发展经济。
