According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 17th (reporters Ye Shitao, Liu Jun) Dean Xu Zhen of Fudan University's School of Journalism said that universities should provide the news industry with "reliable talent" who are politically trustworthy.

Professor Xu Zhen said, "Reliable talent" first and foremost have good political qualities, can adhere to the correct political direction, and can consciously play the role of the party's ears, eyes, and mouth once they enter the workplace.

Xu Zhen said, in recent years, the bourgeois liberalization trend has been rampant, and some bourgeois journalistic viewpoints in the news industry have had a significant impact on students within the school. We say that newspapers are the ears, eyes, and mouth of the party, government, and people, but some people only vaguely refer to them as "media for dissemination," ignoring their class nature; we say that news should propagate the party's policies and guidelines, but some people only emphasize so-called social interests, even claiming that the audience's interests are the starting point and end goal of newspapers; we talk about the party nature of news, but some people say that people's nature is above party nature. He said, during this turmoil, some people in society proposed so-called "news freedom," and students followed suit, holding banners that read "news freedom, return our guidepost" and marching in the streets. In reality, these students don't understand what news freedom is. In a class society, news does not have freedom above classes. Some people advocate for "news freedom," isn't that just giving them the freedom to oppose the central government's major decisions and incite the overthrow of the legal government?

How to cultivate politically qualified news reserves? Professor Xu Zhen emphasized the need to strengthen students' education in Marxist-Leninist theory, establish a revolutionary worldview and methodology; strengthen historical education, understand China's national conditions, and continuously conduct education on the party's journalistic theory, journalistic work traditions, and the professional ethics of journalists. Of course, the study of news business and skills cannot be neglected. Useful experiences from capitalist countries' news work should indeed be introduced and absorbed, but the current trend of introducing more and evaluating less should be changed.

This dean is currently drafting a long-term reform plan. He envisions that future journalism majors will be selected from young people with news practice experience, and another group will be recruited through examinations from students who have already completed two years in other majors. This way, the students' political maturity and knowledge base will be better than those who have just graduated from high school.

### 复旦大学新闻学院院长提出  新闻专业要加强政治教育  向新闻界输送“信得过的人才”

    复旦大学新闻学院院长提出
    新闻专业要加强政治教育
    向新闻界输送“信得过的人才”
    据新华社上海8月17日电（记者叶世涛、刘军）复旦大学新闻学院院长徐震说，大学要向新闻界输送政治上“信得过的人才”。
    徐震教授说，“信得过的人才”，首先是政治素质好，能坚持正确的政治方向，将来踏上工作岗位能自觉地发挥党的耳目喉舌作用。
    徐震说，这几年资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，新闻界一些资产阶级新闻观点对院内学生有很大影响。我们说报纸是党、政府和人民的耳目喉舌，有人只笼统讲是‘传播媒介’，抹杀了阶级性；我们讲新闻要宣传党的方针、政策，有人只强调所谓社会兴趣，甚至认为受众兴趣是报纸的出发点和归宿；我们讲新闻的党性原则，有人却说人民性高于党性。他说，这场动乱中，社会上有人提出所谓的“新闻自由”，学生们也跟着起哄，打着“新闻自由、还我导报”的横幅上街游行。其实这些学生根本不懂什么叫新闻自由。在阶级社会里，新闻没有超阶级的自由。某些人提倡“新闻自由”，不就是让他们有反对党中央重大决策、煽动推翻合法政府的自由吗？
    怎样培养政治上合格的新闻后备力量？徐震教授强调要加强对学生进行马列主义理论教育，树立革命的人生观和方法论；加强历史教育，了解中国的国情，并且要自始至终地进行党的新闻理论、新闻工作传统和新闻工作者职业道德的教育。当然新闻业务和技巧的学习也不能放松。对资本主义国家新闻工作有用的经验固然要介绍和吸收，但应改变目前介绍多、评述少的倾向。
    这位院长正在酝酿一个长远的改革方案。他设想将来的新闻专业学生一是从有新闻实践经验的青年中选择，另一个是从已读过两年大学的其他系的学生中招考。这样生源比普通高中毕业生政治上要成熟，知识面也广些。
