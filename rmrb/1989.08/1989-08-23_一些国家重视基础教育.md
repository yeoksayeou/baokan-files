Many countries around the world, particularly developed ones, attach great importance to popularizing basic education. Although these countries have different national conditions, and the policies, measures, and conditions for popularizing basic education vary, they have formed some common development trends in their practice of popularizing basic education.

Firstly, many countries regard popularizing basic education as a foundational project for promoting national modernization. Today, people increasingly realize that the competition between nations in economic and military strength is not mainly determined by natural resources, but by the overall scientific and technological level of the country and the cultural quality of the entire nation. Therefore, the challenge of the new technological revolution is not primarily a technological one, but a challenge to the educational systems of various countries and a challenge to the preparation of talent. Currently, international educational competition is intensifying, which reflects this situation.

The function of modern education is not only to ensure the reproduction of the labor force but also to directly promote the great development of material and spiritual production.

According to statistical analysis, about 50% of the economic growth rate in the Federal Republic of Germany is attributed to the popularization of national basic education. After the war, Japan popularized nine-year basic education, providing and reserving a large number of high-quality human resources, thereby greatly promoting the development of Japan's productivity and economic takeoff. Therefore, many developed countries have successively regarded the popularization of basic education as a fundamental national policy for strengthening the country and enriching the people.

Secondly, there is a general trend to extend the duration of basic education. Looking at the history of popularizing basic education in various developed countries, one can find that the duration of basic education is generally adapted to the stage of scientific and technological development.

For example, during the era of the electrical technology revolution, it was required that workers on average have a cultural level equivalent to a junior high school graduate. At that time, many countries popularized nine-year basic education. In today's era of the new technological revolution, it is required that workers on average have a cultural level equivalent to a high school graduate. Therefore, developed countries are now generally extending the duration of basic education, popularizing 11-13 years of basic education. Currently, the countries at the forefront of popularizing basic education are the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, Britain, and the Federal Republic of Germany. The duration of basic education in these countries is also at the forefront of the world. Currently, some states in the United States have extended the duration of basic education to 13 years; Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries have extended the duration of basic education to 12 years, reaching the high school graduation stage.

Thirdly, attention is paid to the integration of basic education and vocational education. With the shortening of the cycle of technological application and promotion in production, many new and complex jobs have emerged, leading to changes in the occupational structure and the job market. Thus, in some developed countries, the popularization of basic education has shown a new trend, that is, the "vocationalization" of basic education, which continuously adjusts, integrates, and enriches the requirements and content of vocational education and labor education in basic education, introducing vocational education and labor education knowledge and skills into basic education.

The United States has proposed the concept of "livelihood education," and in the process of popularizing basic education, vocational high schools, technical schools, or vocational centers have emerged, aiming to provide basic vocational training for all students during their basic education period.

The Soviet Union combines secondary basic education and vocational education, establishing specialized vocational guidance teachers and vocational guidance consultation institutions for students, led by basic education and production combined institutions.

    一些国家重视基础教育
    余逸群
    世界上许多国家，尤其是发达国家普遍重视普及基础教育。虽然这些国家的国情不同，实施普及基础教育的政策、措施和条件也各异，但是，它们在普及基础教育的实践过程中形成了一些共同的发展趋势。
    首先，许多国家都把普及基础教育作为促进国家现代化的奠基工程。当今，人们越来越深刻地认识到，当代国际之间经济和军事实力的竞争，主要不是取决于自然资源，而是取决于整个国家的科技水平与整个民族的文化素质。因此，新技术革命时代的挑战，首先并非是技术上的挑战，而是对各国教育体制的挑战，对人才准备的挑战。现今，国际教育竞争正愈演愈烈，就是这种形势的反映。
    现代教育的功能，不仅是为了保证劳动力的再生产，而且也直接推动物质和精神生产的极大发展。
    据统计分析，目前联邦德国的经济增长率中的50％左右应归功于国家基础教育的普及；战后，日本普及了九年制基础教育，提供和储备了大批良好的人力资源，从而大大促进了日本生产力的发展和经济的腾飞。所以，许多发达国家都纷纷把普及基础教育作为一项强国富民的基本国策。
    第二，普遍延长普及基础教育的年限。纵观各发达国家普及基础教育的历史，可以发现普及基础教育的年限大体上是同科技发展阶段相适应的。
    例如，在电气技术革命时代，要求劳动者平均应具有初中毕业的文化程度和水平，当时许多国家都普及了九年制基础教育。而在今天的新技术革命时代，要求劳动者平均应具备高中毕业的文化程度和水平，所以，现在发达国家普遍延长基础教育的年限，普及11—13年的基础教育。当今走在普及基础教育前列的国家当推美国、苏联、日本、英国和联邦德国，这些国家普及基础教育的年限也同样居世界各国前列。目前，美国有些州基础教育的普及年限已高达13年；日本、联邦德国等普及基础教育的年限为12年，达到了高中毕业阶段。
    第三，注重基础教育与职业教育的渗透。伴随着科技在生产上的应用和推广的周期的缩短，出现了许多新的复杂工作，导致了职业结构和就业市场的变化。这样，一些发达国家普及基础教育就出现了一个新的趋势，即“基础教育的职业化”，就是不断调整、融合、充实普及基础教育中的职业教育、劳动教育的要求和内容，把职业教育和劳动教育的知识、技能引进到基础教育中来。
    美国提出了“生计教育”的构想，在普及基础教育过程中随即出现了职业高中、技术学校或职业中心，旨在使所有的学生在接受基础教育期间，接受基本的职业训练。
    苏联则将中等基础教育和职业教育合为一体，专门设立负责职业定向专职教师，并建立基础教育和生产联合机构领导学生的职业定向咨询工作。
