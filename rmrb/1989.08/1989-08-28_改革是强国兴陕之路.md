Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially during the 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Shaanxi Province has broken out of its long-term state of closure and stagnation, and all aspects of its development have seen tremendous progress. The fundamental practice of Shaanxi's 10 years of reform is that, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have led the entire province's Party members, cadres, and the people to adhere to the four cardinal principles, carry forward the Yan'an spirit, take economic construction as the center, strive to overcome poverty and achieve prosperity, and realize the historic transformation from weakness to strength.

In the practice of reform and development, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, in combination with the provincial characteristics, have determined the economic development strategy of Shaanxi and the corresponding reform measures: First, based on the contrast between the strong scientific research institutions and colleges in Shaanxi's large and medium-sized cities and the low cultural and technical qualifications of laborers in remote areas, the strategy of "education as the foundation, science and technology for the revitalization of Shaanxi" has been formulated. The education system is reformed, basic education is strengthened, and a batch of urgently needed talents for economic construction are cultivated. The "double release" policy is implemented for scientific research institutions and scientific and technological personnel, and the development of scientific research, teaching, and production combination is vigorously promoted. 50,000 scientific and technological personnel are organized to contract factories, breeding, and planting in enterprises, rural areas, and increase the ability to convert science and technology into productive forces. Second, based on the production structure characteristics of the central and two wings of Shaanxi, the strategic layout of "focusing on the development of Guanzhong, actively developing southern and northern Shaanxi" has been formulated. Gradually, Guanzhong is built into an outward processing base, grain, cotton, and oil base, and a tourist area with humanities as the characteristic; gradually, northern Shaanxi is built into an important energy and chemical industry base and a commercial base for forestry and animal husbandry, and southern Shaanxi is built into a commercial base for electricity, mining, and local specialties. Third, the unreasonable industrial structure, product structure, and enterprise structure of the province are adjusted based on the characteristics of weak basic industries and backward transportation in Shaanxi. Fourth, the advantage of having many state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in Shaanxi is utilized, and the focus of economic work is placed on large and medium-sized enterprises, and preferential policies for supporting the strong are formulated. In 12 large and medium-sized enterprises under the province, reform pilot projects are organized, and preferential policies are given; for 49 tax-paying enterprises, a slanting policy is implemented, making the output value and tax revenue of large and medium-sized enterprises significantly increase. Fifth, the advantage of having many military enterprises in Shaanxi and strong technical strength is utilized to implement the policy of "combining military and civilian use," focusing on the development of high-starting, high-technology, and high-value-added products, making the civilian product value of military industry 14 times higher than before the reform. Sixth, the advantage of having a large labor force in Shaanxi, and the relatively developed industry, technology, education, and market in large and medium-sized cities is utilized to formulate a regional development model of urban-rural economic integration with central cities as the support. Seventh, the advantage of having many cultural relics and rich tourism resources in Shaanxi is utilized to formulate a development strategy of the tertiary industry with tourism as the leading factor, enhance Shaanxi's international influence, and make the province a non-trade foreign exchange earning base. Eighth, in the reform, socialist spiritual civilization construction is strengthened, and the education of adhering to the four cardinal principles and the "four haves" is widely carried out, and attention is paid to the ideological and political work of workers, mobilizing the socialist enthusiasm of the broad laborers.

Ten years of reform have initially changed the situation of low productivity and poverty in Shaanxi, realizing the doubling of nine economic indicators such as national gross output value, rural social total output value, industrial total output value, and per capita net income of farmers. The urban and rural economies have shown an unprecedented active situation, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have been significantly improved. People's ways of thinking, spiritual outlook, and economic and social life have undergone profound changes.

The four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strengthening the nation and revitalizing Shaanxi. Reform and opening up represent the fundamental interests of the people and are in line with the hearts of the Party and the people. We must, in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, remove various obstacles, and more boldly deepen the reform, promote opening up, and promote the stable and coordinated development of Shaanxi's economy and all undertakings.

    改革是强国兴陕之路
    中共陕西省委书记　张勃兴
    陕西省省长　侯宗宾
    建国40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来的10年间，陕西省结束了长期封闭和停滞的局面，各项事业都有了巨大发展。陕西10年改革的基本实践，就是在党中央、国务院的领导下，省委、省政府带领全省党员、干部和人民群众，坚持四项基本原则，发扬延安精神，以经济建设为中心，治穷致富，实现由弱变强的历史性转变。
    省委、省政府在改革和发展的实践中，结合省情特点，确定了陕西经济发展战略以及与之协调配套的改革措施：一是根据陕西大中城市科研机构、大专院校多，技术力量强，边远地区劳动者文化技术素质较低的反差情况，制定了“教育奠基、科技兴陕”的战略方针，改革教育体制，加强基础教育，培养一批经济建设的急需人才。对科研单位、科技人才实行“双放”政策，大力发展科研、教学、生产联合体，组织5万名科技人员到企业、农村承包工厂、养殖业和种植业，增强科技转化为生产力的能力。二是根据陕西中部和两翼生产力结构特点，制定了“重点发展关中，积极开发陕南陕北”的战略布局。逐步把关中建成以机械、电子、纺织为主的外向加工基地、粮棉油基地和以人文为特点的旅游区；逐步把陕北建成重要能源化工基地和林牧业商品基地，把陕南建成电力、采矿和山货土特产商品基地。三是抓住陕西基础工业薄弱、交通落后的特点，对我省不合理的产业结构、产品结构和企业结构进行调整。四是利用陕西国有大中型企业多的优势，把经济工作的重点放在大中型企业，制定放宽搞活的扶优政策。在省属12户大中型企业组织了改革超前试点，给予优惠政策；对49家利税大户，实行倾斜政策，使大中型企业的产值、利税有了大幅度提高。五是抓住陕西军工企业多，技术力量雄厚的特点，贯彻“军民结合”的方针，重点开发高起点、高技术、高附加值产品，使军工的民品产值比改革前增长了14倍。六是利用陕西劳动力较多，大中城市工业、技术、教育、市场比较发达的优势，制定了以中心城市为依托，实行城乡经济一体化的区域发展模式。七是利用陕西文物古迹多、旅游资源丰富的优势，制定以旅游为龙头的第三产业发展战略，增强陕西的国际影响，使我省成为非贸易创汇基地。八是在改革中，加强社会主义精神文明建设，广泛进行坚持四项基本原则和“四有”教育，注意抓好职工的思想政治工作，调动广大劳动者的社会主义积极性。
    10年的改革，使陕西生产力低下和贫困落后的状况得到初步改变，实现了国民生产总值、农村社会总产值、工业总产值和农民年人均纯收入等9项经济指标翻番。城乡经济出现前所未有的活跃局面，人民物质文化生活水平显著提高，人们的思维方式、精神面貌以及经济生活、社会生活都发生了深刻的变化。
    四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国兴陕之路。改革开放代表了人民的根本利益，顺乎党心民心。我们要按照党的十三届四中全会精神，排除各种困扰，更大胆地深化改革，推动开放，促进陕西经济和各项事业稳步协调地继续向前发展。
