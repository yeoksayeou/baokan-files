Ten rioters involved in the March 5 disturbances in Lhasa were publicly sentenced today by the Lhasa Intermediate People's Court and the Chengguan District People's Court of Lhasa.

In early July, the Lhasa Municipal People's Procuratorate and the Chengguan District People's Procuratorate filed public prosecutions against 10 defendants, including Bianba, Nyima, and Zhande. The Lhasa Intermediate People's Court and the Chengguan District People's Court of Lhasa tried the cases of Bianba, Nyima, and others for counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement; Laba, Qiangba Danzeng, and others for disrupting public order; and Qundai, Quji, and others for intentionally damaging public and private property.

The sentencing meeting announced: Criminal Bianba actively participated in counter-revolutionary rioting on March 6 this year, leading the shouting of reactionary slogans, waving the "Snow Lion Flag," and wantonly destroying public property. According to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, Bianba was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for one year. Criminal Laba Dunzhu, during the March 5 disturbances, went on a rampage of beating, smashing, looting, and burning, constituting the crime of intentionally damaging public and private property and disrupting public order, and was sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment. The other eight criminals were sentenced to less than two years' imprisonment for crimes of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, disrupting public order, and intentionally damaging public and private property.
