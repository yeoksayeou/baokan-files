Mid-August, the author visited Hu Xiuqiong, a prominent pig farmer in Jinma Township, Sifu Village, Wenjiang County, located in the Sichuan Basin.

Her home is surrounded by lush green trees and a small bridge over flowing water. The family's two mu of contracted land includes 1.5 mu for the pig farm. Led by Hu Xiuqiong, we toured her pig farm. We saw 21 pig pens arranged in two rows. The pigs inside lay quietly, undisturbed by our presence. She said, "This year, we have already sold over 250 fat pigs, and there are still over 60 pigs weighing more than 60 kilograms in the pens!"

When talking about raising pigs, her husband Shi Xingyou was enthusiastic: "In every dynasty and for every person, who doesn't eat meat? As people's living standards improve, pork sells well. Farmers, after all, have to farm and raise pigs!"

Shi Xingyou mentioned that while the price of compound feed is a bit high, green feed, bran water, and restaurant waste water are also usable. Last year, they sold over 420 pigs, and this year, they sold over 450. In the future, they plan to expand and aim to produce 1,000 fat pigs annually. He pointed to the back of the house and said, "The collective supports us, and expanding the pig farm won't be a problem."

County Livestock Bureau Director Sang Mingxin was also excited: "Over 1,000 households, accounting for 2% of the county's farmers, are specialized pig farmers, contributing 10% of the commercial pigs. Sichuan pigs are famous nationwide, and specialized farmers make a significant contribution."

Over the past decade of reform, Sichuan's pig farming industry, characterized by the rise of specialized farmers, has shown strong advantages: the province's annual output of fat pigs has continuously increased, from over 20 million, over 40 million, to over 57 million last year, accounting for 1/5 of the nation's output.

Currently, Sichuan's pig farming industry has become one of the province's major advantages. In addition to meeting the local pork demand, it also exports tens of thousands of tons annually to support over 20 provinces and cities nationwide, earning the reputation of "Sichuan pigs everywhere."

Sichuan pigs are famous, and livestock workers have worked hard. The province has promoted a set of practical and advanced pig farming technologies, changing the traditional pig farming landscape, saving feed, and reducing fuel costs, benefiting pig farmers. The proportion of lean meat-type crossbred pigs in the province has increased from around 10% in 1978 to over 65%. Visitors from other provinces praise, "Sichuan has plenty of pork, and the pigs have a lot of lean meat." The secret lies here.

### 四川猪肉多

    四川猪肉多
    8月中旬，笔者访问了川西平原上温江县的养猪大户胡秀琼。
    她家坐落在金马乡四友村四组。院前绿树浓荫，院侧小桥流水，全家两亩承包地，猪场占了1.5亩。由胡秀琼领着参观她的猪场。但见21眼猪圈，分成两排，圈内的猪，静静躺着，见人不惊。她说：“今年我家已卖肥猪250多头，圈里60公斤以上的还有60多头！”
    说起养猪，她丈夫石兴友眉飞色舞：“哪个朝代哪个人不吃肉？人民生活提高，猪肉好销，农民嘛，种粮养猪不得拐！”
    石兴友说，眼前配合饲料价钱有点“冒”，但青绿饲料、粉渣粉水、宾馆潲水也要得。去年卖猪420多头，今年卖450多头，往后再发展，争取年出肥猪1000头。他指着屋后说：“集体支持我，扩大猪场没问题。”
    在旁的县畜牧局长桑明鑫也很兴奋：“全县占农户2％的1000多户养猪专业户，提供商品猪占10％。川猪遍天下，专业户贡献大。”
    改革10年，以专业户崛起为特点的四川养猪业，显示出强大优势：全省年出栏肥猪连续跨越3个“台阶”，由2000多万头、4000多万头上升到去年5700多万头，出栏肉猪占全国1／5。
    目前，四川养猪业已经成为全省的一大优势产业，除省内猪肉充分敞开供应之外，每年还要调出二三十万吨支援全国20多个省、市，赢得了“川猪遍天下”的美誉。
    川猪享有盛名，畜牧工作者付出了辛劳。全省推广一整套养猪实用先进技术，改变了千百年来养猪格局，节约饲料，节省燃料，养猪农民深受其益。全省瘦肉型生猪杂交面由1978年10％左右提高到65％以上。外地客人来成都，称赞“四川猪肉多，猪的瘦肉也多”，奥妙就在这儿。
