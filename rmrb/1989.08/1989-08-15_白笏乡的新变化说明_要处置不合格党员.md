    In the past, Baihu Town in our county was plagued by gambling and fighting, primarily due to the negative influence of some party members. Some party members wore compasses around their necks to practice superstition as a profession; some organized gambling, leading to some gamblers selling their oxen to pay off debts; some resorted to violence, causing trouble in the town; some spread rumors and stirred up trouble, creating incidents. There was a serious problem of weakened will and lax discipline among party members. In December last year, our county committee conducted a pilot program to properly handle unqualified party members in this town. Through democratic evaluation by the masses, out of 303 party members in the town, 283 were found to be qualified or basically qualified, 20 were basically unqualified or unqualified, 13 party members were given a deadline to correct their behavior, and 7 party members were persuaded to leave the party.

    Dealing with unqualified party members has brought about new changes:

    Party members are taking the lead in various tasks. In Putang Village, the couple Zhou Changfu and Zhuang Juhua are both party members. Their daughter-in-law had long been a candidate for sterilization, but they had always prevented it, resulting in Putang Village failing to complete its family planning tasks year after year. During the democratic evaluation of party members, Zhou Changfu and Zhuang Juhua were given a deadline to correct their behavior. This spring, during the family planning work, they voluntarily sent their daughter-in-law for sterilization. Following their lead, all 32 sterilization candidates in the village underwent the procedure, making Putang Village the first in the town to complete its family planning tasks.

    Spirits have been revived. In recent years, many rural party members in our county have been reluctant to serve as officials. In the past, when the villagers of Tanghe Village elected Wang Fubao as the group leader, he refused to take the position. After the democratic evaluation of party members, he realized his weakened will. During this year's group leader election, he willingly took on the role of village group leader. In Tanghe Village, the party member Zhou Chong'an of Waotang Village has rich work experience but thought that being an official was a disadvantage, so he did not serve as an official for 10 years. This year, he took on the responsibility of village group leader. On his first day in office, he led the villagers to repair water conservancy projects, inspect the power station, and eliminate long-standing water disputes in the village, ensuring that more than 100 acres of low-lying farmland can be harvested regardless of drought or flood.

    The fighting spirit has been enhanced. This spring festival, four party members in this village group firmly banned gambling. They pooled money to buy paper to write slogans and the "Regulations on Public Security Administration Punishments" and posted them, set up an anti-gambling propaganda board, and organized patrols on their own. So far, there have been no gambling incidents in this village group. In the past, Bailian Village had rampant illegal logging, and no one dared to intervene. After the democratic evaluation of party members, the party members organized patrols on the mountain and managed it strictly. Now, the village has completely stopped illegal logging.

    Because the party members have revived their spirits, the positive atmosphere in Baihu Town is on the rise.

### 白笏乡的新变化说明——要处置不合格党员

    白笏乡的新变化说明——
    要处置不合格党员
    我县白笏乡过去赌博、斗殴盛行，主要是一些党员起了坏作用。有的党员胸挂罗盘看风水，以迷信活动为职业；有的党员聚众赌博，致使有的赌徒偷卖耕牛还赌债；有的党员动辄拔拳相见，横行乡里；有的党员传播谣言，搬弄是非，制造事端。党员中意志衰退，纪律涣散现象严重。去年12月，我县县委在这个乡开展妥善处置不合格党员试点。通过群众民主评议，全乡303名党员，合格或基本合格的党员283名，基本不合格或不合格的党员20名，13名党员限期改正，7名党员被劝退出党。
    处置不合格党员带来了新变化：
    党员在各项工作中起模范带头作用。蒲塘村周长富、枟菊南夫妇俩都是党员，儿媳早就是结扎对象，但一直被他们拦阻没有结扎，致使蒲塘村计划生育任务年年不能完成。民主评议党员时，周长富、枟菊南受到限期改正处置。今春计划生育工作中，他们夫妇俩主动送儿媳结扎。在他们带动下，全村32名结扎对象全部做了结扎手术，在全乡率先完成计划生育任务。
    焕发了精神。近几年来，我县不少农村党员不愿当干部。过去塘和村杨咀村民选党员汪福宝当组长，他死活不愿干。民主评议党员后，他认识到自己意志衰退。今年村民组长改选时，他乐意地当了村民组长。塘和村洼塘村民组党员周崇安工作经验丰富，但认为当干部吃亏，10年没有当干部。今年他主动挑起村民组长的重担，上任的第一天就带领群众兴修水利，检修电站，消除了这个村民组多年水事纠纷的隐患，并使100多亩低洼农田可旱涝保收。
    斗争性增强。今年春节，这个村民组4名党员坚决禁赌，他们自己凑钱买纸写标语和《治安管理处罚条例》张贴，办禁赌宣传栏，并自动组织巡逻。到目前为止，这个村民组没有出现过赌博现象。白联村过去乱砍滥伐林木无人敢管。民主评议党员后，党员们组织巡山，严格管理，现在这个村已杜绝了乱砍滥伐现象。
    由于党员们振奋了精神，现在白笏乡正气上升。
