The Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting, published by the Shanghai Calligraphy and Painting Publishing House, has won the "National Grand Prize" at this year's Leipzig International Book Art Exhibition.

The Leipzig International Book Exhibition is held annually, with a major exhibition every six years. This year marks a major exhibition, with over 80 countries and regions providing more than 5,000 books for the exhibition.

The Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting is the first comprehensive collection of Chinese paintings in the history of China, compiled and printed by the Ming Dynasty artist and publisher Hu Zhengyan. This collection includes over 300 works by famous scholars and artists of the time, and was printed in 1619 and completed in 1633.

Due to the passage of time, the remaining copies of the Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting are extremely rare. The Shanghai Calligraphy and Painting Publishing House, in order to preserve the cultural heritage of the motherland, spent two years searching for the original copies in eight major cities' cultural and historical units and collectors. After selecting the base copy, they meticulously printed it over three years, resulting in today's Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of Calligraphy and Painting.

    《十竹斋书画谱》获国际大奖
    新华社上海8月13日电　（通讯员舒民）上海书画出版社出版的《十竹斋书画谱》，在今年莱比锡国际书籍艺术大展中荣获“国家大奖”。
    莱比锡国际书展每年一小展，六年一大展。今年适逢大展，80多个国家和地区为大展提供了5000多册图书。
    《十竹斋书画谱》是我国历史上第一部卷帙浩繁的中国画套印画册，由明代艺术家、出版家胡正言编印。这个画谱收集了当时名人时贤作品300余件，付梓于1619年，完成于1633年。
    因年代久远，留存于今的《十竹斋书画谱》的残本已凤毛麟角。上海书画出版社为保存祖国文化遗产，费时两年、遍访八大城市的文博单位和藏家寻找原本。在选定底本以后，精印三年，方成今天的《十竹斋书画谱》。
