As growth regulators for crops, the rare earth elements lanthanum and cerium are being applied to an increasing area of farmland each year. By the first five months of this year, the area of farmland in China's rural regions where rare earth elements have been applied has expanded rapidly from 8 million mu in 1986 to over 20 million mu, achieving significant economic benefits.

Rare earth elements are a relatively abundant group in China's non-ferrous metal resources, with proven industrial reserves ranking first in the world. In the early 1970s, China began exploring the use of rare earth elements in agricultural production. After more than a decade of collaborative research by relevant scientific research institutions, the research on rare earth agricultural technology has reached an internationally leading position. Experiments have shown that, on the basis of ensuring other measures, the application of small amounts of lanthanum and cerium as crop growth regulators can promote rooting, germination, and chlorophyll production in crops, enhance the absorption and transport of nutrients such as phosphorus, increase the accumulation of dry matter, and increase the yield and improve the quality of some crops.

This technology was officially promoted on a large scale after being accepted by relevant state departments in early 1986. The main crops to which rare earth elements are applied include spring wheat, sugarcane, vegetables, peanuts, and tobacco leaves. After hundreds of yield measurements and inspections in various places, it has been found that the yield of spring wheat increases by 8.2% per mu after the application of rare earth elements; the yield of fresh sugarcane increases by about 300 kilograms per mu, and the sugar content increases by 0.3 to 0.7 percentage points. The effect of rare earth elements on crops such as Chinese cabbage and watermelon is significant, with an increase in yield of over 10%. In recent years, the economic benefits of crops to which rare earth elements have been applied nationwide have exceeded 300 million yuan, with an increase in grain production of about 500 million kilograms. The ratio of investment to return for rare earth elements is approximately 1:7 for grain crops and 1:10 for economic crops, with the cost of applying rare earth elements per mu being about 0.4 to 0.5 yuan.

Due to the simplicity, low cost, and significant effects of rare earth agricultural technology, it has been welcomed by state farms and farmers across the country. From January to May this year, the national consumption of rare earth elements was nearly 800 tons, and the area of farmland where rare earth elements are applied exceeded 20 million mu.

    资源丰富  方法简单  成本低廉
    我国推广稀土农用技术  收效显著处于领先地位
    新华社北京8月10日电　（记者余富棠）作为农作物生长调节剂的稀土镧、铈两种元素，推广施用的农田面积正在逐年扩大。今年1至5月，我国农村推广施用稀土的农作物面积已由1986年的800万亩迅速扩大到2000多万亩，并获得良好的经济效益。
    稀土，是我国有色金属资源中较为丰富的一组元素，已探明的工业储量居世界首位。七十年代初，我国开始探索将稀土元素用于农业生产。经过有关科研单位10多年协作攻关，稀土农用技术的研究已居国际领先地位。试验证明，在其他措施保证的基础上，应用少量稀土镧、铈两种元素作为农作物生长调节剂，可促进农作物生根、发芽和增加叶绿素，促进农作物对磷等养分的吸收和运转，增加干物质的积累，使部分农作物增加产量和改善农作物品质。
    这项技术于1986年初经国家有关部门验收后开始大面积推广。施用稀土的农作物主要有春小麦、甘蔗、瓜菜、花生和烟叶等。经过各地上百次的测产和验收表明，春小麦施用稀土后每亩增产8.2％；甘蔗每亩增产鲜蔗约300公斤，提高含糖量0.3至0.7个百分点。稀土对大白菜、西瓜等作物效果明显，增产幅度在10％以上。几年来，全国施用稀土的农作物增加的经济效益超过3亿元，约增产粮食5亿公斤。施用稀土的投资与收益之比，对粮食作物约1∶7，对经济作物为1∶10，每亩地施用稀土的成本约0.4元至0.5元。
    由于稀土农用技术简单，成本低，效果明显，受到各地国营农场和农户的欢迎。今年1至5月，全国稀土使用量近800吨，稀土农用面积突破2000万亩。
