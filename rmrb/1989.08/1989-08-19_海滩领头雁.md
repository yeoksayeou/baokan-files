Jianxi Village is just 1 kilometer from the sea and was once a patch of pitted and potholed wasteland. Two years ago, there were no roads, no electricity, no drainage ditches, no boats for fishing, and no shops. Within a 3600-acre area, 260 households with over 1000 people lived there, sustaining themselves through self-cultivation and self-sufficiency.

In May 1987, the organization appointed Yang Changbao to establish Jianxi Village. His first task upon arriving was to conduct a household survey. Facing the numerous difficulties in production and life and the doubting yet hopeful gazes of the people, he said, "Let's work together. First, we'll spend a year digging ditches, paving roads, building boats, and bringing in electricity." He presented the plan discussed by the party branch: First, develop water conservancy projects, dig channels, and excavate 140,000 cubic meters of earth. The earth would be used to build east-west channels on both sides, sold to households for construction, and could generate over 10,000 yuan to pay for labor costs. Second, the village collective would take out loans to build 3 boats for fishing, which would be contracted out to individuals to start operations. Those who wanted to go fishing could also get loans from the village to build boats. Third, Yang Changbao had already borrowed 15,000 yuan from relatives, and other cadres had also contributed their savings, totaling 30,000 yuan. Everyone would contribute a little more. The power station agreed to raise 40,000 yuan to ensure electricity by the end of the year. Fourth...

Before Yang Changbao could finish, the crowd erupted in excitement: "We'll follow the village party branch's lead, no matter how hard it is, we'll work together!"

Two years have passed. Jianxi Village has dug east-west channels and north-south drainage ditches totaling 5300 meters, built 4 drainage culverts, and doubled agricultural output. There are now 27 sea vessels, with an annual fishery income of 1.2 million yuan. High and low-voltage power lines have been installed, and every household has electricity. The per capita net income in 1986 was 600 yuan, and by 1988, it had increased to 1240 yuan.

Among these big and small changes, what Jianxi villagers will never forget is: when digging channels, Yang Changbao did not carry less dirt than anyone else; when erecting poles and laying lines, he worked with the people for over 90 days; in the coldest days of winter, he led the way across the frozen central river to bring electricity into the village. Yang Changbao often led the village cadres to serve on the ships, and the shipowners wanted to pay the "shiphead fee," but he firmly refused, and none of the other cadres accepted it. At the year-end performance evaluation and distribution last year, the village party secretary should have received 1400 yuan in bonuses. Yang Changbao told the accountant, "Keep my bonus to repay the village collective's loan." After learning this, the other cadres also asked the accountant to do the same.

    海滩领头雁
    杨春蕖
    弶西村，离海只有1公里，原是一片坑坑洼洼的海滩荒地。两年前的这儿，没有路，没有电，没有一条排水沟，没有一条可以出海捕鱼的船。没有一家商店。方圆3600亩地盘内散居着260户1000多人口，过着自垦自食的生活。
    1987年5月，组织上委派杨昌宝组建弶西村，进村第一件事，是走家串户调查摸底。面对群众生产上、生活上的重重困难和一双双疑惑而又期待的目光，他说：“我们一起干，先用一年时间挖沟、铺路、钉船、通电。”他把支部讨论好的方案端了出来：第一、兴修水利，开渠挖沟，累计14000多土方，把土垒在东西渠道的两侧作价卖给建房户，可收1万多元，正好支付民工工资。第二、由村集体贷款钉3条船出海捕鱼，承包给个人先干起来；其他想要出海的，村里也可以帮助贷款钉船。第三，杨昌宝已经找亲戚借了15000元，其他干部也都掏了家底，现已凑足3万元，大家每人再集资一点。农电站答应，要集资4万元，保证今年过年通电。第四……不等杨昌宝说完，群众便沸腾起来了：“我们听村支部的，再苦也跟着干！”
    两年过去了，弶西村开挖了东西渠道和南北排水沟10条，总长5300米，修造排水涵洞4座，农业产值翻了一番；现有海船27条，年渔业收入120万元；架设高、低压电线路，家家户户电灯亮……全村人均纯收入1986年600元，1988年增长到1240元。
    在这大大小小的变化中，令弶西村民不能忘记的是：开渠挖沟，杨昌宝不比一般人少担土方；立杆架线，他跟群众一起抬杆子90多天；数九寒天，是他带头趟过结冰的中心河，把电线架进村里。杨昌宝经常带领村干部出海服务到船头，船主要发“船头费”，他坚决不收，其他干部也没有一个收的。去年年终考核分配时，村支书应得1400元奖金，杨昌宝对会计说：“把我的奖金留下还村集体的贷款。”其他干部知道后，也都叫会计这么做了。
