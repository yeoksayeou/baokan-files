The rapid development of contemporary high technology is driving progress in many fields and at various levels, influencing economic changes and shifts in international relations. At the same time, high-tech development itself has formed some new characteristics.

The competitive landscape is diversifying. In recent years, as high technology has continued to advance, competition among countries has intensified. Japan has made significant strides in computer hardware, microelectronics, optoelectronics, robotics, biotechnology, and new materials, surpassing the United States in some areas and becoming its main competitor. Western Europe, relying on its overall strength and basic research capabilities, is challenging the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Japan in aerospace, biotechnology, and nuclear energy utilization. The space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is heating up. Developing countries and regions such as China, India, Brazil, and South Korea are also advancing into high-tech fields and have achieved notable success in some areas.

To gain and maintain an advantage, many countries are increasing their research investments. The U.S. has seen a 6% annual increase in basic research funding over the past decade, while Japan's basic research funding has surged by 12% in recent years. The Soviet Union and Britain have seen even larger increases in basic research investments. Meanwhile, the competition for talent among countries has intensified. The European Community plans to invest 1.67 billion European Currency Units to establish a large-scale community research institution to attract European scientists to participate in research.

Today, the U.S.'s monopoly in the high-tech field has been broken, and a multipolar competitive landscape has taken shape.

Research results are being industrialized. High technology, with its strong industrial linkage effect, has spawned a batch of new industries and transformed and equipped a batch of traditional industries, injecting new vitality into traditional industries. Currently, optoelectronic technology has become a pillar of the information society, with the optoelectronic industry growing faster than the electronics industry. It is expected that by the end of the century, the market size will reach $200 billion. Japan has used new ceramic materials to develop high-efficiency car engines, which went into production last year. The value of electronic components in each car has risen from $300 to $900. The Soviet Union extracts 120 million tons of single-cell protein from microbial synthesis factories each year. Singapore has made remarkable achievements in using information technology to transform traditional industries. After equipping the port authority with a computer expert system, the time each cargo ship stays in port has been reduced from 9 hours to 4 hours. "Computer banks" even allow customers to conduct various transactions from their home terminals. Currently, many countries have established science parks or high-tech development zones, providing policy advantages in investment, taxation, and other areas to encourage the integration of research and development, and the collaboration of government, industry, and academia. Currently, the cycle for converting scientific and technological achievements into commodities is shortening. In some developed countries, updating products generally takes only 5 to 8 years, and some advanced products take only 2 to 3 years. The industrialization process of high technology is accelerating, and its scope is expanding.

Research is market-oriented. Contemporary high-tech research, whether basic or applied, has a clear market orientation. Last August, Britain established the "Science and Technology Development Application Center," whose tasks include analyzing market opportunities, setting research topics, promoting research and development, accelerating the conversion of results, and solving market problems for scientific research results. South Korea's high-tech development plan prioritizes the research and development of microelectronics and fine chemicals, which have good market prospects and high returns. Currently, high-tech research in some developed countries is aimed at both short-term and long-term markets, not only reflecting technological competition but also market occupation and expansion competition.

Scientific research is internationalizing. The development of contemporary society continually presents humanity with many common concerns, such as food shortages, resource depletion, and ecological deterioration, which require international cooperation to address. Additionally, many major and cutting-edge research topics are becoming increasingly complex, requiring significant human and financial resources, making it difficult for a single country to bear the burden. Both objective and subjective factors are driving high-tech international cooperation to become increasingly widespread. Last September, the U.S., Japan, Canada, and nine Western European countries signed an agreement to jointly build a large-scale permanent orbital space station, with a total investment of $23 billion. The Soviet Union has proposed jointly exploring Mars with the U.S. and has begun preliminary cooperation. In response to Japan's call, last June, the seven Western countries reached an agreement on cooperation for the "Human New Domain Research Program." The Soviet Union, the U.S., and Western Europe have established an international group to study nuclear fusion. International cooperation to study and solve issues such as the "greenhouse effect" and "saving the Earth" is also in the works. Both cooperation and competition in the high-tech field on an international scale will be a long-term trend.

    当代高科技发展的特点
    谢伏瞻
    当代高科技的迅猛发展正在许多领域和不同层次上推动社会进步，影响经济变革和国际关系变化。同时，高科技自身的发展也形成了一些新的特点。
    竞争格局多元化。近些年来，随着高科技的不断发展，各国之间的竞争明显加剧。日本在计算机硬件、微电子、光电子、机器人、生物工程、新材料等领域的许多方面追赶美国，有些领域的研究成果超过了美国，成为美国的主要竞争对手。西欧依靠其整体力量和基础科研能力，在航空航天、生物工程和核能利用等方面向美苏日发起挑战。美苏之间的空间竞争愈演愈烈。包括中国在内的一些发展中国家和地区如印度、巴西、南朝鲜也向高科技进军，并在部分领域取得了显著成就。
    为了取得优势和保持优势，不少国家纷纷追加科研投资。美国的基础科研经费10年来年均增长6％，日本近年基础科研经费的增幅高达12％，苏联、英国对基础科研投资的增幅更大。与此同时，各国之间人才争夺加剧。欧共体为防止人才外流拟投资1.67亿欧洲货币单位筹建大规模的共同体研究机构，吸引欧洲科技人员参加研究。
    今天，美国在高科技领域的垄断地位已被打破，群雄并起的多极竞争格局基本形成。
    科研成果产业化。高科技以其很强的产业关联效应带动了一批新产业的诞生，同时也改造和武装了一批传统产业，为传统产业注入了新的活力。目前，光电子技术已经成为信息社会的一大支柱，光电子产业增长率超过了电子产业，预计到本世纪末，市场规模将达到2000亿美元。日本利用新型陶瓷材料研制的高效能汽车发动机去年投产。每辆汽车中装备的电子器件的价值已从300美元上升到900美元。苏联每年从微生物合成工厂提取120万吨单细胞蛋白。新加坡在应用信息技术改造传统产业方面成绩蜚然，该国港务局装备计算机专家系统以后，每只货船的留港时间从9小时减至4小时，“计算机银行”甚至可使顾客在家中的终端上进行各种联系。目前，许多国家建立了科学园或高技术开发区，从投资、税收等方面给予政策优惠，鼓励研究与开发结合，官、产、学结合。目前，科技成果转化为商品的周期缩短，在一些发达国家，更新产品一般只需5至8年，某些先进产品只需2至3年。高科技的产业化进程正在加速，范围也在拓广。
    科研瞄准市场。当代高科技的研究，无论是基础研究还是应用研究，市场取向成了一个明显因素。去年8月，英国成立了“科技开发应用中心”，其任务就是分析市场机会、确立研究课题、促进研究开发、加速成果转化，解决科研成果的市场问题，南朝鲜的高科技发展计划把市场前景好、效益高的微电子和精细化工的研究开发作为优先发展方向。目前，一些发达国家的高科技研究既瞄准近期市场，也放眼远期市场，不仅表现为技术水平的竞争，更表现为市场占有和扩张的竞争。
    科学研究国际化。当代社会的发展不断向人类提出许多共同关心的问题，如粮食短缺、资源枯竭、生态恶化，这些都需要国际性合作，才有可能研究解决。另外，许多重大、尖端的研究课题越来越复杂，需要投入大量人力、财力，一国难以单独承担。主客观方面的诸多原因促使高科技的国际合作日趋广泛。去年9月，美国、日本、加拿大和9个西欧国家签署了共同建成大型永久性轨道空间站的协议，总投资230亿美元。苏联主动提出与美国共同探索火星，已开始了初步合作。响应日本的呼吁，去年6月，西方7国就“人体新领域研究计划”的合作达成协议。苏联、美国、西欧成立了研究核聚变的国际性团体。共同研究、解决“温室效应”、“拯救地球”的国际性大协作也在酝酿之中。国际范围内高科技领域既有合作，也有竞争将是长期的发展趋势。
