A conference of petition office directors and heads of petition offices from 10 provinces and municipalities concluded in Beijing today. The conference conveyed the important opinions of CCP Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin and CCP Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member Qiao Shi on petition work.

Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that petition work is an important channel for our party and government to promote democracy, understand public sentiment, and maintain contact with the masses. Currently, to better implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, all levels of party committees and governments must strengthen their leadership over petition work, enabling it to play a greater role in building socialist democracy and the rule of law, and in strengthening the relationship between the party and government with the people.

Comrade Qiao Shi pointed out that petition work is an important task for the party and government to maintain close ties with the people. It is essential to ensure that channels are open and that the issues raised by the people are treated seriously. Coordination with relevant departments and localities is necessary to clarify the situation and resolve issues appropriately.

This conference was convened by the Central Office and the General Office of the State Council on August 16 in Beijing. Representatives from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Liaoning attended the meeting.

During the conference, attendees carefully studied the important opinions of Comrades Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi. They reported on the implementation of Premier Li Peng's requirements in March this year that petition work should "contribute to the long-term stability and prosperity of our country." They exchanged experiences in petition work during the suppression of turmoil and the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and focused on studying how petition work can serve the implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

A responsible comrade from the General Office of the State Council attended the conference.
