Economic criminals in Chongqing are severely fleeing with funds. From January 1988 to March 1989, the city had 61 economic cases involving 73 criminals who fled with funds, totaling over 1.68 million yuan in illegal and criminal funds, an increase of 36% compared to 1987. Currently, 33 criminals have been captured, and over 1.2 million yuan in illicit funds have been recovered.

The characteristics of economic criminals fleeing with funds are as follows:

1. Embezzlement and misappropriation cases are prominent. There are 44 cases of embezzlement and misappropriation involving criminals fleeing with funds, accounting for 72% of the total economic cases with fugitives.

2. Major and serious cases are prominent. There are 30 cases involving criminals fleeing with funds where the illegal and criminal funds exceed 100,000 yuan, accounting for 49.2% of the total cases with fugitives. For instance, the cashier of Southwest Normal University, Yan Hua, embezzled and misappropriated 420,000 yuan in public funds, fleeing with over 50,000 yuan. On January 5, 1988, the procuratorial organ captured him in Luliang City.

3. Criminals involved in sudden, one-time offenses are prominent. These economic criminals seize opportunities to commit crimes, either not stealing at all or stealing a large amount in one go and then fleeing. There are 38 cases of one-time offenses involving criminals fleeing with funds, accounting for 63% of the total cases with fugitives.

4. Employees handling money and goods are prominent. Among the 73 criminals who fled with funds, over 40 are from financial, supply and marketing, grain, commercial, and construction departments, directly managing money and goods as cashiers, accountants, business operators, and tax collectors. They exploited opportunities to handle checks, collect payments, and issue goods to commit crimes and flee, accounting for 54.8%.

5. Young and middle-aged criminals fleeing with funds are prominent. Those under 30 years old account for 42, those between 30 and 40 years old account for 23, and those over 40 years old account for only 8. For example, Huang Kui, an 18-year-old salesperson from the urban branch of Changshou County Department Store, took the opportunity when other salespersons were away to steal 2,500 yuan in business funds and fled to squander it all.

6. Non-Party members committing crimes and fleeing are prominent. The vast majority of those who fled with funds are non-Party members. Among the 73 fugitives, 56 are non-Party members, accounting for 76.7%, 16 are league members, accounting for 21.9%, and 1 is a Party member, accounting for 1.4%.

The reasons why economic criminals can flee with funds include:

1. Negligence and lax management by the units where the crimes occurred, failing to discover the crimes or report them to judicial organs in a timely manner, allowing economic criminals to escape. There are 48 such cases, accounting for 78.7% of the total cases with fugitives. For example, the metal recycling factory of Bishan County Materials Bureau entrusted all checks, accounting seals, and financial seals to a 19-year-old female cashier, Liu Qi. Over two years, no financial inspection system was established, and the factory leadership never checked the accounts. Liu Qi and her boyfriend, Xia Ruihua, conspired to forge 40 checks, embezzling 94,000 yuan in public funds and fleeing. It was only when an external unit came to the factory to demand payment for goods that the leadership discovered the crime and reported it.

2. Lack of necessary and effective compulsory measures. Investigating economic cases involves first gathering evidence and then capturing the criminals. When the procuratorial organ conducts preliminary investigations into economic case leads, they often "alert the snakes," allowing criminals to escape upon hearing the news. There are 15 cases of criminals fleeing during the preliminary investigation stage, accounting for 25% of the total cases with fugitives. Even when measures such as surveillance residence and bail pending trial are taken, some surveillance units and bailors are highly irresponsible, failing to exert the necessary compulsory effect, allowing economic criminals to escape. Due to ineffective compulsory measures, over 20 criminals fled, accounting for 27.4% of the total fugitives.

    重庆经济犯罪分子携款潜逃严重
    我市经济违法犯罪分子携款潜逃严重。仅1988年1月至1989年3月，全市就有61件经济案件的73名案犯携款潜逃，共涉及违法犯罪金额168万余元，比1987年上升36％。目前已捕获案犯33人，追回赃款120多万元。
    案犯携款潜逃的经济案件表现出6个“突出”：
    一是贪污挪用案件的案犯逃跑突出。全市有44件贪污、挪用案件的案犯携款潜逃，占携款潜逃经济案件的72％。
    二是重特大案件的案犯逃跑突出。违法犯罪金额在万元以上重特大案件的案犯携款潜逃的有30件，占携款潜逃案件的49.2％。西南师大出纳员严华贪污挪用公款42万元，携款5万余元潜逃，去年元月5日，检察机关在涪陵市将其捕获。
    三是突发性的一次作案案犯逃跑突出。这类经济犯罪分子见机行贪，不“捞”则已，一
  “捞”就大“捞”一把，“捞”了就跑。全市一次性作案携款潜逃的经济案件38件，占携款潜逃案件数的63％。
    四是管钱管物的业务人员作案潜逃突出。携款潜逃的73名案犯中，在金融、供销、粮食、商业、建筑部门，直接经管钱物的出纳、会计、营业、税收等业务人员，利用保管支票、收款、提货等机会作案潜逃的就有40余名，占54.8％。
    五是中青年携款潜逃突出。30岁以下的携款潜逃人员占42人，30—40岁的23人，40岁以上的仅占8人。长寿县百货公司城内门市部18岁的营业员黄魁，乘柜组其他营业员离开时，将清点好的营业款2500元装进自己包里外逃挥霍殆尽。
    六是非党团员作案逃跑突出。携款潜逃的绝大多数是非党团员。73名潜逃案犯中，非党团员56人，占76.7％，团员16人，占21.9％；党员1人，占1.4％。
    经济犯罪分子能够携款潜逃，除了逃避法律惩罚、急于挥霍享受等主观原因外，在客观上有：
    一、发案单位管理的疏漏和松懈，没有发现或者发现后不及时向司法机关报案，致使经济犯罪分子乘机出逃。这类案件有48件，占携款潜逃案件的78.7％。璧山县物资局金属回收公司加工厂将支票、会计印章、财务印章全部交由19岁的女出纳员刘茜保管；而且两年多时间不建立财务检查制度，厂领导也没有检查过一次帐目。刘茜与其男朋友夏瑞华共谋，私填支票40张，贪污公款9.4万余元后潜逃。直到外单位到该厂追要货款时，厂领导才发现，报案。
    二、缺乏必要的、有效的强制措施。查办经济案件是先找证据，后捕人。检察机关对经济案件线索进行初查时，往往“打草惊蛇”，案犯得以闻风而逃。发生在检察机关初查时潜逃的案件就有15件，占潜逃总件数的25％。即使采取了监视居住，取保候审等强制措施，但一些监视单位、取保人严重地不负责任，起不到应有的强制作用，致使经济案犯活动失控，有机可逃。由于强制措施不力，而潜逃的案犯就有20余人，占潜逃总人数的27.4％。
