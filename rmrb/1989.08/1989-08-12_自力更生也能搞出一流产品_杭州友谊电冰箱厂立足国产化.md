In the current intense market competition for refrigerators, Hangzhou Friendship Refrigerator Factory, which adheres to the path of self-reliance and domestic production, has entered the domestic and international markets with its high-quality products. Starting from August, the factory will successively hold product exhibitions and sales in cities in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. A batch of new products has been well received by consumers.

Currently, the factory has achieved an annual production capacity of 120,000 refrigerators. A central leader, after learning about this, praised the factory for adhering to the path of self-reliance and hard work, developing domestic production, and embodying a national spirit.

Hangzhou Friendship Refrigerator Factory was established in 1983 by converting from sewing machine production to refrigerator production. Initially, it had only 100,000 yuan in capital. They used this money to purchase a few imported refrigerators as samples, collaborated with military enterprises to design and manufacture production lines, and bought some raw materials and components to start self-manufacturing.

The compressor is a key component of the refrigerator. Hangzhou Friendship Refrigerator Factory did not have foreign exchange to purchase imported ones. Fortunately, a military enterprise in Shaanxi had developed a domestic compressor that was not in demand. Factory director Shen Lequn, upon learning this, went to the enterprise and became its first customer.

The factory needed to expand its scale but did not have the conditions to introduce equipment. The factory continued to collaborate with military enterprises, achieving full domestic production of all production lines. The three production lines for 60,000 units of 200-liter, three-door, four-star refrigerators, except for a microcomputer on the computer testing machine that was imported, were all designed and manufactured domestically by referencing advanced foreign technologies, costing only 600,000 yuan. If relying on imports, it would have cost two to three million US dollars.

The factory's leadership believes that domestic refrigerators must have certain advantages over imported ones to stand firm in the competition. In recent years, they have worked with technicians to develop several new products with first-class advanced levels, obtaining six national patents.

    自力更生也能搞出一流产品
    杭州友谊电冰箱厂立足国产化
    本报讯　在当前电冰箱产销竞争激烈的时候，自力更生走国产化道路的杭州友谊电冰箱总厂以它的优质产品挺进国内外市场。从8月起，这个厂陆续在华北、东北、西北一些城市举行产品展销，一批新产品受到消费者的青睐。
    目前，这个厂已形成年产12万台冰箱的规模。中央一位领导同志了解后，称赞该厂坚持自力更生、艰苦创业的道路，发展国产化生产，有一种民族精神。
    友谊电冰箱总厂于1983年由缝纫机转产电冰箱，起步时只有10万元资金。他们拿这点钱购置几台进口冰箱作样品，与军工企业合作设计制造生产流水线，购买一些原材料和器件，便开始自行制造。
    压缩机是电冰箱的关键部件，友谊冰箱总厂没有外汇购买进口货。正好，陕西一家军工企业研制出国产压缩机，无人问津。厂长沈乐群知道后，便找上门去，成为它的第一个用户。
    工厂要扩大规模，但没有条件引进设备。该厂仍然走与军工企业合作的道路，使全部生产线实现国产化。年产6万台4星级200升3门冰箱的三条生产线，除了电脑测试机上的一台微型计算机是进口的以外，其余都是参考国外先进技术自行设计制造的，只花了60万元人民币。如果依靠进口，需要二三百万美元。
    这家厂的领导认定：国产冰箱要在竞争中站稳脚跟，必须有超越进口货的某些优点。这几年，他们和科技人员埋头研究，相继开发出几种具有一流先进水平的新产品，曾获得6项国家专利。
