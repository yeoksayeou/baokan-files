Iran's new President Rafsanjani today, after taking the oath of office, pledged to rebuild the country's economy, which has been severely damaged by war, and to avoid new conflicts.

According to the Islamic Republic News Agency of Iran, Rafsanjani said that the new Iranian government must start preparing for large-scale economic construction now.

He opposed the idea that Iran only needs political independence and does not need to develop production. He stressed that only when the country is economically strong will independence have meaning.

Iranian television broadcast Rafsanjani's speech after he took the oath of office.

It was also reported that Rafsanjani, during his meeting with the visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Jacob Khan, reiterated that if the United States changes its hostile policy towards Iran, Iran will help release Western hostages held in Lebanon. He ruled out the possibility of talks between the U.S. and Iran, saying: "The United States has not shown any sincerity."

    拉夫桑贾尼就任总统后保证
    重振经济　避免战争
    新华社德黑兰8月17日电  伊朗新总统拉夫桑贾尼今天在宣誓就职后表示，保证重建受到严重战争创伤的伊朗经济，避免发生新的战争。
    据伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社报道，拉夫桑贾尼说，伊朗新政府必须从现在开始为更大规模的经济建设作准备。
    他表示，反对那种伊朗只要政治独立而不需要发展生产的观点。他强调说，只有国家经济上强大，独立才有意义。
    伊朗电视台转播了拉夫桑贾尼宣誓就职后发表的讲话。
    另据报道，拉夫桑贾尼当天在会见来访的巴基斯坦外长雅各布·汗时重申，如果美国改变其对伊朗的敌对政策，伊朗将帮助释放关押在黎巴嫩的西方人质。他排除了美伊进行谈判的可能性，因为他说：“美国尚未表现出诚意。”
