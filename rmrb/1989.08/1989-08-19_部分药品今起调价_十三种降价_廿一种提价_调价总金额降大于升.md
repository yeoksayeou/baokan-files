People's Daily, Beijing, August 19th. Reporter Wang Jinhu reports: With the approval of the State Council, the State Price Bureau and the State Pharmaceutical Administration have decided to adjust the prices of certain chemical drugs starting from August 20th. Thirteen items, including Pioneer 4 and Methiocarb, will have their prices reduced; 21 items, including Aspirin and Anacin, will have their prices increased. The total amount of the price adjustments will result in a net decrease.

According to relevant departments, in recent years, some commonly used therapeutic drugs have seen price reductions and increases in the prices of grains and chemical raw materials, leading to increased costs, production losses, reduced output, and a growing number of items out of stock. Meanwhile, some health supplements and newly introduced drugs have seen rapid development due to high prices and profits, with many items becoming overstocked. To implement the rectification and adjustment policy, guide enterprises to reasonably adjust their product structures, and ensure the supply of medical drugs, relevant departments have decided to adjust the prices of certain drugs that are priced too high or too low, and are severely unreasonable, with some prices increasing and others decreasing.

    部分药品今起调价
    十三种降价  廿一种提价
    调价总金额降大于升
    本报北京8月19日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：经国务院同意，国家物价局、国家医药管理局决定从8月20日起调整部分化学药品价格：先锋4号、甲氰咪呱等13个品种降低价格；阿斯匹林、安乃近等21个品种适当提价。调价总金额是降大于升。
    据有关部门介绍，近几年来，一些常用治疗药品因价格偏低和粮食、化工原料价格上涨，成本增大，生产亏损，产量下降，市场脱销品种不断增加；而一些滋补药和移植新药因价高利大发展过快，不少品种已滞销积压。为贯彻治理整顿的方针，引导企业合理调整产品结构，保证医疗用药，有关部门决定对部分价格偏高偏低、严重不合理的药品，有升有降地调整价格。
