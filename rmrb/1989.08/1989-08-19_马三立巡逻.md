Ma Sanli on Patrol

In the Keyi Residential Area of Guajiasi Street, Hexi District, Tianjin, most of the residents are from the scientific and artistic communities.

One day, an elderly man with a frail but spirited appearance walked out of a building. On his left arm, he wore a large red armband with two yellow characters: "On Duty." This was the renowned crosstalk performer Ma Sanli.

Today, this elderly artist had a different demeanor from his usual humorous and witty self; he looked solemn and serious. It turned out that he was on a patrol duty to maintain public order. Two years ago, the neighborhood committee called for elderly artists to join the volunteer public order patrol team. At that time, 75-year-old Ma Sanli was the first to respond. Following his lead, artists such as Zhao Songqiao, Qiu Aihua, and Wang Zezhao also joined the team.

Despite his age and frailty, Ma Sanli's presence alone was enough to deter potential criminals, who would flee at the sight of him. In his own words, "I may not be intimidating, but the red armband I wear is. It's like a talisman that wards off evil!"

When Ma Sanli patrolled the streets, people recognized him. Those riding bicycles and tricycles would stop and gather around. Ma Sanli, seeing the crowd, urged, "Everyone is busy, please go about your work! I am on patrol now. You can all come to my place for a visit another time; I live right here in this building." As people began to disperse, he reminded everyone to be careful while riding.

The patrols have created a safe environment for the residents of this area.

Residential volunteer patrol teams like the one in Keyi Residential Area are scattered throughout Tianjin. They are responsible for preventing theft, fire, and maintaining public order. Together with the professional patrol teams from the public security and armed police, they form a comprehensive patrol network for the city, playing a crucial role in maintaining Tianjin's public order.

### 马三立巡逻

    马三立巡逻
    天津市河西区挂甲寺街的科艺里，居住的大部分是科技、文艺界人士。
    这天，从一栋楼门里，走出一位瘦骨嶙峋而又精神矍铄的老人，左臂的大红袖标上，写着两个黄色大字：“值勤”。他就是著名相声表演艺术家马三立。
    今天，这位老艺人一改往日诙谐、幽默的神态，表情庄重严肃。原来，他在执行治安巡逻任务。两年多以前，居委会号召老艺人参加义务治安巡逻队。当时七十五岁的马三立第一个响应。在他的带动下，赵松樵、裘爱花、王则昭等老艺术家也加入了这个行列。
    别看马三立人老体弱，可是企图伺机作案的人，远远地见了他就逃之夭夭。用马三立的话说：“我这个人，一口唾沫就能唾个跟头，坏人不是怕我，是怕我戴的红箍，红箍能避邪！”
    马三立巡逻到街上，人们认出了他，骑自行车的，蹬三轮车的，纷纷停下来围观，马老急了：“大家都挺忙的，快工作去吧！我现在正巡逻，改日你们大家上我家串门去，我就在这楼里住。”人们开始离去，他嘱咐大家要注意行车安全。
    巡逻为这一片居民区创造了良好的治安环境。
    像科艺里这样的居民义务巡逻队，遍布天津市各个角落，担负着居民区的防盗、防火、维持治安秩序等任务。他们与公安、武警的专职巡逻队相配合，形成了全市的治安巡逻网络，对维护天津市的治安环境起到了重要作用。
