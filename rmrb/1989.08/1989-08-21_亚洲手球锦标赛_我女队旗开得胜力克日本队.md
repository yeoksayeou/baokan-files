    亚洲手球锦标赛
    我女队旗开得胜力克日本队
    本报北京8月21日讯　记者刘小明报道：亚洲男女手球锦标赛今天进入第二天，共有4场赛事。中国女队旗开得胜，以25∶21战胜强硬对手日本队，为打入前两名奠定良好基础。奥运会女子手球金牌得主南朝鲜队今天遇到实力较弱的香港队，轻松地以51∶8大胜。在另外两场男子比赛中，日本队以33∶20胜中国台北队，南朝鲜队以32∶19胜卡塔尔队。
    中国女子手球队主教练张玉林比赛后对记者说：“同日本队一战很关键。我们队刚调整，新手多，这场比赛我们打得艰苦。我对队员们的表现基本满意，下半时比上半时打得好。现在我们队技术上有不少薄弱环节，这个队再过两年我看还是大有希望的。”
