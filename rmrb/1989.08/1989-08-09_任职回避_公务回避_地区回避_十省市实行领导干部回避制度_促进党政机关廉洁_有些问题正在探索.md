The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department has provided information indicating that provinces such as Shaanxi, Hebei, and Hainan, as well as municipalities like Beijing, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, and Jiangxi, have established and implemented a system of avoidance for leading cadres in party and government organs over the past few years, tailored to their local conditions, and have achieved notable results.

Most of these provinces and municipalities began this reform in 1986. At that time, many places had varying degrees of issues where leading cadres and their relatives worked in the same unit or department, and local cadres had been serving in their home regions for extended periods. In Shaanxi Province, for instance, in ten units including Zhouzhi County, 36.8% of the 114 county-level and above cadres had relatives working in the same unit. According to statistics from Sichuan, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Tianjin, out of 1051 county-level party secretaries, mayors, discipline inspection commission secretaries, organization department heads, and labor and personnel bureau heads, 53% were local cadres.

The situation where cadres and their relatives work in the same unit or department, along with cadres serving long-term in their home regions, has brought about several issues: it restricts the cadres' vision, making it difficult for them to work with a broad perspective, affecting their growth; it hinders the correct implementation of party and state policies on cadres and employment, fostering improper practices; it can lead to complex internal personnel relationships within units; and it results in bloated organizations and redundant personnel. In one region, out of five leading cadres in an intermediate court, four had spouses or children working in the court. Cadres and the public commented, "The court has become a 'family business,' a 'husband-and-wife shop,' a 'network of relatives.'"

In light of these issues, starting from early 1986, the Central Committee's Organization Department conducted extensive investigations and research, and proposed some ideas and principles regarding the establishment of an avoidance system for leading cadres in party and government organs. Subsequently, many places began to establish and implement avoidance systems suitable for their local conditions.

The avoidance systems established and implemented by various places generally include three main components:

- **Position Avoidance**: Cadres holding leading positions in party committees, governments, and discipline inspection commissions, public security, courts, and procuratorates should not have their spouses, children, or relatives hold leading positions with direct supervisory relationships. They should not hold leading positions in the office, organization, personnel, labor, supervision departments, or the same-level discipline inspection agencies of the cadre's unit. Generally, they should not work in the same unit as the cadre.

- **Official Duty Avoidance**: Leading cadres in party and government organs should not be involved in any business-related work concerning their own appointments, demotions, file management, and transfer, nor should they instruct or hint at others to interfere. In matters such as cadre appointments, salary adjustments, party membership, professional title evaluations, the investigation of legal and disciplinary cases, the selection of personnel for overseas assignments, recruitment of workers, allocation of college graduates, and the placement of demobilized military personnel, if any of these involve the cadre's relatives, the cadre should proactively inform the organization and implement avoidance, not participating in investigations, discussions, approvals, or instructing and hinting at others to interfere. The cadre's spouse, children, relatives, and staff should not use the cadre's name or work conveniences to participate in the aforementioned duties that require avoidance.

- **Regional Avoidance**: County (city) party secretaries, mayors, discipline inspection commission secretaries, organization department heads, personnel bureau heads, public security bureau heads, court presidents, and procurators should not be local cadres. Cadres born in the county (city) who are elected to hold the aforementioned positions should not continue to serve in the same place after completing one term.

The scope of avoidance subjects is generally similar across regions, with a few areas having slightly broader scopes. The subjects of position avoidance generally include cadres with spousal relationships, near relatives (parents, children, siblings), and in-laws (spouses of children and their parents).

In implementing the avoidance system for leading cadres in party and government organs, various places have emphasized doing a good job in ideological and political work. They have analyzed the causes of cadres and their relatives working in the same unit or department in a realistic and reasonable manner, not blaming individuals for problems that arise under normal circumstances or due to institutional flaws. Most regions have also used various forms to propagate the significance of implementing the avoidance system for party and government leading cadres, creating a favorable public opinion environment for the implementation of cadre avoidance, and making the avoidance subjects and their relatives genuinely establish the idea of subordinating personal interests to the interests of the party and the people, willingly accepting the organization's arrangements.

In implementing the cadre avoidance system, various places have emphasized starting from local conditions, properly solving problems encountered in avoidance work, and not adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. For local cadres in remote mountainous areas, impoverished regions, and areas with concentrated minority populations, generally more flexible policies and methods are adopted. For leading cadres who are close to retirement age, have health issues, or have family members with special difficulties, and who are indeed not suitable for regional avoidance, the avoidance is implemented by changing their positions. For all avoidance subjects, adjustments are made as much as possible to match their professional and technical skills, enabling them to exert their talents in new positions.

Many places have, while establishing the avoidance system for leading cadres in party and government organs, paid attention to building and improving systems for cadre recruitment, terms of office, exchanges, appointments, and dismissals. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee has stipulated that in the future, cadres with spousal relationships, three generations of direct and collateral relatives, and in-laws should, in principle, not work in the same organ. The allocation of college graduates, recruitment of cadres, and the placement of demobilized military personnel should, except for special professional needs, avoid placing relatives in the same unit as much as possible. For those who need to consider family relationships, arrangements should be made nearby. Some places have also clearly stipulated the cancellation of internal recruitment for workers and cadres.

Currently, the aforementioned regions are further exploring solutions to some problems that have emerged in the previous practice, such as narrow regional views hindering cadre mobility, how to unify the implementation of the avoidance system with the principle of equal competition and the selection of outstanding cadres, how to unify it with democratic elections, and how to combine it with the implementation of the exchange system.

    任职回避  公务回避  地区回避
    十省市实行领导干部回避制度
    促进党政机关廉洁  有些问题正在探索
    本报讯　中共中央组织部提供的情况表明，陕西、河北、海南等省，北京、山西、黑龙江、四川、贵州、河南、江西等省市的部分地区，从当地的实际情况出发，近几年来先后建立、实行党政机关领导干部回避制度，取得了成效。
    上述省、市的这一改革，多数始于1986年。当时，不少地方不同程度地存在着领导干部与其亲属在同一单位或部门工作，当地干部长期在本地任职的状况。陕西省周至县等十个单位，114名县处级以上干部中，在本单位内有亲属关系的占36.8％。据四川、江苏、河北和天津市对231个县的统计，在1051名县委书记、县长、纪委书记、组织部长和劳动、人事局长中，本地干部占53％。
    干部与其亲属在同一单位或部门工作与干部长期在原籍任职的状况，带来了许多弊端：干部视野受到限制，难以放开手脚干工作，影响了干部的成长；妨碍党和国家干部政策和用工政策的正确执行，助长了不正之风；容易导致单位内部人事关系的复杂化；造成机构臃肿、人浮于事。某地区中级法院5名领导干部，有4人的配偶、子女在法院工作。干部、群众说：“法院成了‘父子兵’、‘夫妻店’、‘裙带网’了。”
    鉴于上述情况，从1986年初开始，中央组织部做了大量的调查研究工作，并就建立党政机关领导干部回避制度的问题提出了一些设想和原则性的意见。此后，相当多的地方开始建立和实行适合当地情况的党政机关领导干部回避制度。
    各地建立和实行的党政机关领导干部回避制度，包含三个主要内容：
    ——任职回避。在党委、政府和纪委、公安、法院、检察院担任正副领导职务的干部，其配偶、子女、亲戚不得担任与该领导干部有直接上下级关系的领导职务，不得担任该领导干部所在机关的办公厅（室）、组织、人事、劳动、监察部门和同级纪检机构领导职务，一般也不得在该领导干部所在单位工作。
    ——公务回避。党政机关领导干部不得参与有关本人的任免、档案管理与传递等各项业务工作，也不得指使、暗示他人施加影响，进行干预。在干部任免调配、调整工资、入党、评定和聘任专业技术职称、查处违法违纪案件、选派出国出境人员，以及招工招干、大中专毕业生分配、军队转业干部安置工作中，凡涉及领导干部亲属的，领导干部本人应主动向组织说明并实行回避，不得参加考察、调查、讨论、审批，不得指使和暗示他人进行干预。领导干部的配偶、子女、亲戚和身边工作人员，不得以领导干部的名义或利用工作上的方便，参与上述应该回避的公务。
    ——地区回避。县（市）委书记、县（市）长、县（市）纪委书记、组织部长、人事局长、公安局长、法院院长、检察长，不得由本籍干部担任。本县（市）出生的干部，在本县（市）当选担任上述职务的，任期满一届后，不能继续在原地连任。
    回避对象的范围，各地大致相同，少数地区略宽。任职回避的对象，一般包括夫妻关系、夫妻双方的近亲关系（父、母、子、女、同胞兄弟姐妹），以及儿女姻亲关系（子女的配偶同子女配偶的父母）的干部。
    各地在实行党政机关领导干部回避制度的过程中，重视做好思想政治工作，对党政机关内部干部与其亲属在同一单位或部门工作等状况的成因作实事求是、合情合理的分析，不把正常情况下出现的问题和用人制度上的缺陷造成的问题归咎于个人。多数地区还运用多种形式宣传实行党政领导干部回避制度的意义，造成有利于实行干部回避的舆论环境，使回避对象及其亲属切实树立小道理服从大道理、个人利益服从党和人民的利益的观念，自觉听从组织的安排。
    各地在实行干部回避制度中，强调从当地的实际情况出发，妥善解决回避工作中遇到的问题，不搞一刀切。对边远山区、贫困地区、少数民族聚集地区的本籍干部的回避，一般采取较为灵活的政策和办法。对接近离退休年龄和身体有病及家属有特殊困难，确实不宜进行地区回避的领导干部，用更换工作岗位的办法实行回避。对所有回避对象的调整，尽可能注意专业、业务对口，使其能够在新的岗位上发挥聪明才智。
    不少地方在建立党政机关领导干部回避制度的同时，注意建立健全干部录用、任期、交流、任免等项制度。陕西省委规定，今后凡有夫妻、夫妻双方三代直系亲属和旁系亲属关系及儿女姻亲关系的干部，原则上不得在同一机关工作。大中专毕业生分配、招干分配和复员转业军人安置，除专业上的特殊需要外，要尽可能从单位上避开亲属关系。需要照顾家属关系的，从地域上就近安排。还有一些地方已明确规定，取消招工招干中的“内招”。
    目前，上述地区对前一段实践过程中暴露出来的一些问题，如狭隘的地域观念阻碍干部流动，执行回避制度与贯彻平等竞争的原则、择优选拔干部如何统一，与民主选举如何统一，与执行交流制度如何结合起来等问题，各地正在进一步探索。
