The crackling of firecrackers never stopped.

“When the plane flew over Nanchang, I thought, 40 years have passed, what has become of Liujia Village in Baima Temple?”

“Yes, we eight old friends from Taiwan discussed it over and over. When we left Baima Temple, we were all young men. Now, with silver hair, we dream of our hometown. Even if we die, we must see our birthplace one last time!”

“We each contributed some money. We heard that people on the mainland are having a hard time, so we want to give a gift to our relatives and fellow villagers to cheer them up…”

Upon arriving at Nanchang Yueliang Airport, they inquired about Baima Temple, but no one knew the name. Oh no, this is bad! They began to panic.

Several shiny Santana sedans slowly pulled up. The doors opened, and two young men in neat suits and red ties stepped out, their rugged, clean faces looking especially handsome.

“You are all from the original Liujia Village in Baima Temple, returning from Taiwan, right?”

“Ah, yes, yes!” The visitors from Taiwan exclaimed.

“Please get in the car. We represent the entire village of Warm-hearted People in welcoming you—”

“Warm-hearted Village?” Just as they were about to step into the car, their feet hesitated.

“Don’t misunderstand. Liujia Village in Baima Temple has long been renamed Warm-hearted Village.” The two young men explained.

“Our fellow villagers sent cars to pick us up?” The Taiwanese visitors looked at the cars, which had no “TAXI” signs on the roof, and were puzzled.

At this moment, a young man who had gotten into the first car took out a walkie-talkie: “Hello, hello, we’ve picked them up and are leaving the airport…”

“May I ask, does the village have its own cars?”

“Yes, we have a total of 48 cars, including 7 sedans.” The other young man replied.

Liu Haiping scratched his gray hair: “Hey, where have we come to? We’ve returned to the mainland?”

It was like a flashback in a movie: Baima Temple Liujia Village. The village was crisscrossed with foul-smelling ditches. The low, dilapidated houses were leaning in all directions. People wore rags, had nothing to eat in the morning, chewed on chaff at noon, and looked at the moon in their bowls at night. Life was unbearable, so we went to Taiwan to join the army, and it’s been these many years…

The firecrackers crackled. The villagers rushed out.

As they got out of the car, there were no more foul-smelling ditches in sight. Looking around, several imposing high-rise buildings stood tall. Walking to the center of the village, they saw that each household had a two-story small villa. Inside the houses, there were color TVs, carpets, refrigerators, and telephones. They used gas cylinders for cooking. The young people in the village were all healthy and robust.

The village hosted a banquet for these guests. After toasting with hometown wine, Liu Moxiang, the head of Warm-hearted Village, said with a smile: “When you left, I was just a seven or eight-year-old child. Today, you eight senior fellow villagers from Taiwan have returned to see the changes in Baima Temple, and we are very happy. You should not only see the changes in Baima Temple but also visit many beautiful places and famous scenic spots in mainland China. In the past, you were in bitter water, never leaving Liujia Village, and even after going to Taiwan, you hadn’t seen Beijing or Shanghai. Our village has decided that after you rest for a few days and visit relatives and friends, we will send someone to accompany you to tour other places. All expenses will be covered by us…”

“What, what?” The eight Taiwanese visitors thought they had misheard Liu Moxiang.

“Does your village have so much money to support our tourism?” Liu Haiping asked in surprise.

“Yes, yes.” Deputy Village Head Liu Youshui smiled and extended his hand, saying: “Last year, our village earned 500 million yuan and paid 182 million yuan to the state!”

The “relief money” they had planned to give to their fellow villagers could not be taken out. Liu Haiping did not expect that his nephew, Liu Chunbao, would forcefully give him 8,000 yuan, saying: “You go on a tour. This is for your spending, buy whatever you like to eat or buy!”

“Who is saving whom here?” Liu Haiping whispered to his returning companions.

II. The First Move

If you don’t work hard, it’s not difficult to get rich. The transformation of Warm-hearted Village took only seven years.

Warm-hearted Village has 106 households, with only about 150 mu of farmland and ponds. One household has only a few mu of land. After deducting the food for the family, what else can be grown to sell? In the 30 years after liberation, although the village name was changed, the root of poverty was not eradicated as easily as changing a village name.

In 1982, the state built the Internal Combustion Engine Repair Factory, which requisitioned 120 mu of land from Warm-hearted Village, and thus gave the village 12 million yuan in compensation.

This was a considerable sum of money.

“Divide it up! Each household gets tens of thousands of yuan to live a rich life.”

“Those who can enter the factory should enter the factory. Those who cannot should use this money as capital to do business!”

Everyone looked at Liu Moxiang. He was over 40 years old, not very tall, with a square face that never lost its smile despite poverty. His two big eyes often flashed with a gentle light. “In these years, we all wanted to improve our lives, but it was like a water buffalo falling into a well, unable to use its strength.” Liu Moxiang said: “You want money, and I want money too. But if we divide this money, in a few years, what if we have no money? We farmers have left the land, and without money, do we still want to live?”

“Then what do you suggest?”

“Let’s hear the method you village cadres have discussed and researched!”

Liu Moxiang gently looked at everyone and said: “Drinking wine shows one’s capacity, carrying a pole shows one’s strength. Today, I’ll tell you the bottom line, and then we’ll discuss it. As the saying goes: Only with a stable home can one enjoy work. Our ancestors left us these dilapidated houses, leaning in all directions, making it difficult to walk and for water to flow. Let’s demolish them all, plan them in rows and columns, and then build houses uniformly, one two-story house per household. How about that?”

“Good!”

“How much will it cost?”

“We’ll do the work ourselves, and the old bricks can be used to fill the foundation. We only need to buy new bricks, lime, cement, and steel bars. 50 million yuan will be enough.”

“What if the higher-ups only approve of nest-building but not slope-repairing?”

“Everyone eats the fried beans, and one person bears the blame. I’ll handle the higher-ups.” Liu Moxiang smiled and said: “The remaining 70 million, we’ll use to start a factory.”

“Start a factory? Can we do it?”

“Why not? The first generation of workers weren’t farmers turned into workers! We can also transform.” Liu Moxiang said: “We still have about 30 mu of vegetable fields and ponds. Those that can be farmed will be farmed, and those that can be fished will be fished. We’ll rely on the factory to support the entire village, old and young.”

That year, Warm-hearted Village indeed built 100 houses. Red bricks were used for construction, with two stories, and a small courtyard was enclosed. North and south rows formed a street, with trees planted, creating a beautiful and tidy environment. This immediately caused a sensation in Nanchang City.

People flocked to find Liu Moxiang, praising his idea. At least the previous filth, disorder, and squalor of Warm-hearted Village had completely changed. Just for this, the television station reporters would not let him go.

Who would have thought that Liu Moxiang and a few others were in Shanghai, engaged in bitter negotiations!

III. The Blossoming Plum

Liu Moxiang would never forget this incident: The train was rushing, the car was like a steamer, and it was hot and thirsty. He saw someone selling water, in small glass bottles, very pure. He looked, it was mineral water. He thought: This bottle of water can be drunk in a few sips, mineral water is just natural cold water, it should be 1 jiao per bottle! He wanted to buy one. The vendor told him: “Foreign exchange certificate 1.2 yuan.” “What?” He was stunned. “This is Laoshan mineral water, do you understand!”

At that time, he did not understand. Now, in Shanghai, he understood.

Nanchang is famous for being a furnace. During the hottest days of summer, if someone could walk for an hour on the street without drinking a sip of water, they could be called a hero. Nanchang’s ice popsicles and beverages were in high demand, with supply not meeting demand. The village had 70 million yuan, which could be used to start a beverage factory. To start a factory, it had to be a high-quality one. Thus, he and others went to Shanghai to investigate. They stayed in a small alley for 2 yuan per night in a communal dormitory. Every day, they had to drink some soda water. Shanghai had the most varieties of soda water, and only by drinking could they compare which factory’s soda water was the best. After comparing, it was still the soda water supplied to park visitors by the Garden Soda Water Factory that suited the taste of Nanchang locals. “Your soda water is excellent!” They went to find the person in charge of this factory. It can be said that no factory leader would refuse to listen to praise for their products. The mood became harmonious. “We also plan to start a factory. Would you like to cooperate? We can pay your technology transfer fee.” The shrewd Shanghai people were moved by his expression, and since soda water production had no secrets to keep, they immediately agreed.

At this time, an unexpected piece of news came: A subordinate unit of the East China Sea Fleet had a few technicians with a new technological achievement: artificial mineralized water, specially used for sailors at sea. That is, using ordinary clean tap water, placing it in specially designed equipment for special treatment, and then the water flowing out would contain the calcium, magnesium, sodium, and other components unique to mineral water. Undoubtedly, artificial mineralized water is very beneficial to the human body. Liu Moxiang’s mind sparked with an idea.

The scene from the train flashed before his eyes again. Mineral water could not just be for foreigners. Why couldn’t we combine modern technology with traditional soda water formulas to produce mineral water beverages?!

“Buy this artificial mineral water technology, give it a few hundred thousand yuan!” Liu Moxiang decided, and invited the technical personnel from the Shanghai Garden Soda Water Factory to help start the factory.

Warm-hearted Village established the first mineral water beverage factory in Jiangxi, with the factory design, layout, and equipment being top-notch. The product was called Lushan Mineral Water Beverage, and when it first hit the market, the price per bottle was double that of other sodas, naturally attracting no customers.

“How will people know your product is good? Even the villagers don’t know! Give every household a free box, let them taste the flavor.” Liu Moxiang told the village head Liu Qi: “Also, prepare to hold an order meeting.”

“Hold it in the village?”

“No, at the best hotel in Nanchang, Jiangxi Hotel!”

“Won’t it be too expensive?”

“It has to be. To promote a new product, how can we not spend some publicity money? Your product is good, so you have to have this style. A factory director without confidence can’t run a good factory.”

Sure enough, merchants from all over the province came, and even merchants from neighboring provinces rushed over. People picked up these glass-bottled beverages, took a sip, and were stunned: sweet with a hint of sour, strong orange flavor; after drinking, there was no greasy feeling in the mouth, indicating that it was not like other sodas that added sugar and flavorings. Although the price was 0.25 yuan per bottle, it was still cheaper than Laoshan mineral water and much better to drink than general sodas. After testing, the product was made from orange juice, artificial mineral water, and white sugar, which not only quenched thirst but was also beneficial to the human body.

“I’ll try to sell 50 boxes first, can I?”

“I’ll order 100 boxes.”

“I’ll also order 100 boxes, but with one condition: it has to be quick!”

The mineral water beverage factory officially started production in its first year, with a production value of 30 million yuan and a profit and tax of not less than 50 million yuan. The product won the provincial and municipal excellent product award. The first shot was fired!

The plum blossom bloomed outside the wall. Many reporters from the province and city heard the news and went to interview Liu Moxiang, praising him as the plum blossom that bloomed outside the wall. But they couldn’t find him, as he had gone to Shanghai again.

IV. Climbing the High Building with a Ladder

“Now people eat for nutrition. We still have a lot to do.” After the mineral water beverage market opened, Liu Moxiang gathered a few village heads and held a discussion meeting.

The village had developed, and several capable assistants were needed. Liu Moxiang found Liu Qi, Liu Yunfei, Liu Jiugen, and Liu Youshui, all of whom were in their 30s and had graduated from high school. The business needed a big change, and it was impossible to do without a group of capable people to manage it. Originally, the village was like a ragged coat with a poor foundation. In addition, the old generation of Liujia Village firmly believed in that way of life: “As long as there is food and a place to sleep in winter, and fire in winter, except for immortals, it’s me.” As for what kind of food and what kind of home, they did not care. To change this self-satisfied and self-sufficient old habit, it was necessary to have a young and educated generation to lead the charge.

“Friends looking at their future mother-in-law, friends visiting relatives, children respecting parents, now it’s fashionable to send royal jelly. Why can’t we start a nutritional supplement factory?”

“Right, that’s a good idea. Use the money earned from the mineral water beverage factory to invest, chickens lay eggs, eggs lay chickens.”

“Still find Shanghai, there are many scientific and technological personnel there, advanced equipment, we can borrow the ladder to climb the building.”

Shanghai was a place where talents gathered. Too many talents meant that any technological achievement to be transformed into production was not as easy as one, two, three. Liu Moxiang saw this “specialty” that could only be found in big cities. “We call this borrowing from all sides, borrowing the east wind from all directions, we can’t just take from others. The fruits of intellectual labor are worth a lot of money, we spend a few hundred thousand yuan to buy it ready-made, immediately turn it into a new product, this is called eating a small loss for a big gain!”

He walked into the “Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Nutrition and Diet Therapy Research Association” and related pharmaceutical factories with a smile on his face, inviting experts to come to Warm-hearted Village to take a look. Not only did he buy the technology at a high price, but he also invited them to turn the technology into products. What equipment to add, how to install the equipment to make it excellent, where to purchase the raw materials, how to process in order, how to package the products, he listened to these experts. When starting the “bee milk,” a factory was needed. Liu Moxiang pointed to the village’s guesthouse and said: “This guesthouse is far from the station in front of the village and far from the city behind it, it hasn’t been of much use, change it to industry, make it a nutritional supplement factory.”

“But the guesthouse earns a few hundred yuan a day!”

“That’s not enough to fill a tooth gap. The factory earns a few million or even tens of millions, that’s satisfying!”

Say change and change, no need for left and right approvals, dragging mud and water. The equipment was installed, and the products came out one after another. Soon, they saw that there were many only children in society, and young parents all hoped their children would grow up healthy. They went to consult experts again, resulting in the production of “chicken embryo baby essence,” as a kind of powder, sweet and tasty, containing various vitamins, which could be added to milk, soy milk, porridge, and was not sugar but better than sugar. Children who ate it increased their appetite and were beneficial for growth.

Thus, the nutritional supplement factory, children’s nutritional supplement factory, and packaging and printing factory were established, with a total of more than 20 products. These factories created a production value of more than 50 million yuan. The mineral water beverage factory and these two factories all needed packaging paper, so a packaging and printing factory was also established, with a production value of 80 million yuan last year. The factories were established one by one, and the products came out one by one, each receiving praise. “Chicken embryo baby essence” even won the national gold award three times. The once impoverished Liujia Village in Baima Temple, with 106 households, had developed into Warm-hearted Village with a production value of more than 60 million yuan and a profit of nearly 10 million yuan, ranking among the top in the country in terms of per capita income.

At this time, someone said to Liu Moxiang: “After working hard for a few years, can you take a break?”

“After we become a billion-yuan village.” Liu Moxiang smiled. This person indeed had the ability to foresee the future. As early as 1987, he said to the village cadres: “Isn’t it said that small ships are easy to turn around? Indeed, village-level enterprises are the smallest ships in China, and turning around is faster. But once a storm comes, small ships can’t withstand it, and turning around is too late. An aircraft carrier is not afraid of any storm. Our village also needs to build an ‘aircraft carrier.’” Liu Moxiang finished speaking and looked at everyone. Everyone looked at him in confusion.

“Build a large pharmaceutical factory! Now there are many retired experts in society, invite them to be. The raw materials for the pharmaceutical factory are corn, and China has plenty of corn. I’ve asked, producing terramycin base is a scarce item in the international market.”

The next day, several unexpected guests came to the home of Li Benchang, the former director of Jiangxi Jiangnan Pharmaceutical Factory: “Director Li, are you bored at home after retirement? Come to our place to be a consultant and build a factory. We want to build a large pharmaceutical factory.”

“Do you have the ability?”

“Yes! We have already invited the retired chief engineer of the Chemical Machinery Factory, he will be responsible for the equipment; you only need to be responsible for the drug production of the entire factory…”

“Great!” Li Benchang waved his arm: “I was just bored with so much strength and nowhere to use it!”

The grand “Hongcheng Pharmaceutical Factory” immediately broke ground. The first phase of the project, with an investment of 15 million yuan, was completed in one year. Daily production of terramycin base was 700 kilograms, exported to West Germany, Portugal, and other countries, with an annual production value reaching 19 million yuan. Now the second phase of the project is also underway.

Now, other enterprises are facing difficulties because banks do not lend money, and turning around is useless, and they are halting production. However, customers coming to Warm-hearted Village to buy goods are bringing money but may not be able to buy the goods.

V. The New Thinking of the Warm-hearted People

In recent years, the Warm-hearted People have had many “strange” incidents.

Strange Incident 1: A notice was posted in the streets and alleys of Nanchang: Nanchang City Nutritional Supplement Factory, Children’s Nutritional Supplement Factory, Mineral Water Beverage Factory, Hongcheng Pharmaceutical Factory, and Xinxin Packaging and Printing Factory are publicly recruiting workers. Those with urban household registration in Nanchang City, with junior high school education or above and in good health, can apply. After passing the exam, they will be selected based on their abilities, and salaries will be paid according to state regulations, with bonuses paid based on performance. Applicants please go to the Warm-hearted Village Committee in the suburbs of Nanchang City…

From ancient times, only rural youth went to the city. Now, it’s the rural areas recruiting urban youth, and they even have to pass an exam. Applicants came in droves. Finally, Warm-hearted Village “introduced” more than 1,000 urban youth to work in various enterprises.

Strange Incident 2: Liu Moxiang traveled dozens of miles to Luojiaji Township in Nanchang County and found the township government. The township leaders had long admired him and were waiting for him.

Liu Moxiang took out “A Shima” and gave one to the other person, lighting his own.

“Speak, what brings you here!” After taking a long drag, the other person urged Liu Moxiang to open his mouth.

“You have some wasteland here, how about selling some to us?” Liu Moxiang said directly.

“You want to buy land?” The other person was surprised: “How much?”

“100 mu, how about it?”

“How much money?”

“According to state regulations, not a penny less.”

“Wow, you’re something!”

Luojiaji Township gave up 100 mu of wasteland, and Liu Moxiang paid 13 million yuan. After all the procedures were completed, he immediately mobilized the labor force to plow the wasteland, then raise pigs, grow vegetables, raise chickens and ducks, dig ponds to raise fish. Liu Moxiang made this place the agricultural and sideline product production base of Warm-hearted Village, responsible for solving the agricultural and sideline product supply for those working in Warm-hearted Village.

“People are working hard in our factory, where is the time to line up to buy vegetables, meat, and fish? If they can’t buy and eat, how can they have the heart to work hard!” Liu Moxiang smiled and said: “People’s hearts are made of flesh. We have to take care of them. Setting up such a small farm solves our workers’ worries. Every day, vegetables are delivered in the afternoon, 1 jin per person; every month, 4 jin of meat, 2 jin of fish, 2 jin of eggs, 3 chickens, 1 duck, and a fixed amount of rice are supplied, all for free! As long as everyone can eat well and be happy, the money spent on a little more work will be recovered.”

A reporter asked: “How much money does this cost?”

“Only about 40 to 50 million yuan a year, a small matter.”

Another reporter asked him: “Your ‘A Shima’ is quite expensive, and when guests come, you give them cigarettes to smoke. How do you handle it?”

“That’s easy.” Liu Moxiang lit a cigarette, “I pay for it myself. The village cadres in our village smoke cigarettes, and the village does not reimburse a single penny. The annual income of cadres is at most 4,800 yuan. For me, half of it is spent on cigarettes.”

Strange Incident 3: Someone found Liu Moxiang: “The original household registration in our village, Zhou Xiangzi, was driven to Sanjia Village during the Cultural Revolution, and now he is a 70-year-old widower, living by picking up trash every day!”

“Is it true?” Liu Moxiang held his breath and suppressed his smile. “People will get old. Quickly bring her back, and our village will support her!”

Zhou Xiangzi never dreamed that someone would bring her back, giving her 66 yuan in “retirement” money every month. When she first received these tickets, tears rolled down from her cloudy eyes.

From then on, Warm-hearted Village made a hard rule: Anyone over 60 years old does not need to work and receives a retirement allowance, ranging from 66 yuan to 90 yuan. This spring, the weather was particularly cold, and each old person’s home was knocked on, and a quilt was delivered, “This is from the village for you old people, you won’t be cold if you cover yourselves with it.”

Last summer, Nanchang reached over 40 degrees, and many people died from heatstroke, mostly the elderly. However, the elderly in Warm-hearted Village did not have a single case of illness, because they were all arranged by Liu Moxiang to avoid the heat in Xiaolushan. The money spent was all covered by the village. When the elderly returned, it was already autumn, and everyone was happy.

“Communist Party members should especially respect the elderly and understand humanism!” Liu Moxiang said: “Flowers don’t bloom forever. The elderly have worked hard for decades, now let them relax. Relaxation brings back youth!”

Liu Moxiang’s “elderly policy” had an unexpected effect. If a young person is late to work, leaves early, or is lazy, when they return home, the elderly will scold them: “Have you eaten your heart out?” In this village, these years have not seen a single case of gambling, theft, or fighting. As long as a few people gather, as soon as the poker and money are taken out, the elderly will interrupt: “Watch TV, study books, what can’t you do, why do this?! You’ve gone blind, Liu Ke Nong’s son went to college, and the village rewarded him with 1,000 yuan, why not learn from the good?” When strangers come to the village, every household’s elderly will automatically monitor and immediately report it by phone. The factory naturally also has a security and defense team, which is to prevent outsiders from coming to the village to steal and rob.

Strange Incident 4: “One person steps on the grass, many people walk on the sunlit path.” Liu Moxiang came up with a brilliant idea: “Government-run, privately managed.” There are more than 20 retired engineers alone helping out in the village, and he hopes that college graduates and capable people from other units will also come to his village to work. But now society is still in the primary stage of socialism, and people’s subconscious minds cannot do without an “appointment.” College graduates entering village-run enterprises, with the appointment in the village, there are not many in such a large country. To take care of the mentality of scientific and technological personnel, set up a scientific and technological development company, affiliated with the Science and Technology Commission of Nanchang Suburban District Government, and the appointment is state-owned. However, salaries, bonuses, medical expenses, office expenses, etc., are all paid by the village, and the Science and Technology Commission can also share a little “management fee” from the village every year. If the scientific and technological personnel want to leave, they will be transferred by the Science and Technology Commission, and there is no need to worry about the iron rice bowl being smashed. It’s a good thing Liu Moxiang thought of the government-run, privately managed strategy, and indeed, he attracted more than 30 capable people in one go. Last year, two college graduates also joined, with state-owned appointments, working in village-run enterprises, receiving bonuses from village-run enterprises. Last year, each person’s bonus alone was a few thousand yuan. “You have to start from reality! We haven’t suffered a loss, and we have also taken care of the face and future of scientific and technological personnel. This method is clever!”

Recently, Liu Moxiang has been thinking of new ideas: building a rare earth factory. Rare earth is a non-ferrous metal, known as the magical additive of the next century that will enter various fields of social life. Jiangxi has abundant rare earth resources. This factory has started construction.

Liu Moxiang leads the entire village in striving and charging forward…

    热心人〔报告文学〕
    赵相如
    一、白马村成热心村
    噼噼啪啪的鞭炮声响个不停。
    “飞机到了南昌上空，我就想，40年了，这白马庙刘家村会变成咋个样？”
    “是啊，我们8个老乡在台湾商量了又商量，离开白马庙的时候都是青年后生，如今满头银发，魂牵梦绕着家乡，就是死也得再见一眼生我养我的故土啊！”
    “我们每人还凑了一笔款，听说大陆的人日子过得艰难，我们总要给个见面礼，让子侄乡亲高兴一下……”
    到了南昌向塘机场一打听，白马庙这个地名没人知道。啊呀，这下糟了！他们发急了起来。
    几辆锃亮的桑塔纳轿车徐徐地开了过来。车门打开，两名年轻人穿着笔挺西服，红色领带把洁净粗犷的脸庞映衬得格外俊气。
      “你们都是原先白马庙刘家村的先生，从台湾回来的吧？”
    “啊呀呀，是的，是的——”台湾来客欢叫着。
      “快请上车吧，我们代表热心村的全体乡亲欢迎你们——”
      “热心村？”刚跨上车的脚，又缩了回来。
    “别误会。白马庙刘家村早已改名叫热心村了。”两个年轻人解释说。
      “老乡亲派轿车来接我们？”台胞看着这些轿车顶上没有“TAXI”的字样，有些纳闷。
    这时坐进第一辆车里的小伙子拿出对讲机：“喂，喂，我们接着了，现在离开了机场……”
      “请问，村里有自己的汽车？”
      “有，一共有48辆。”另一个小伙子答道：“其中小轿车7辆。”
    台胞刘海平搔搔自己灰白头发：“嘿嘿，这是到了哪儿？回到大陆来了？”
    好像电影一个闪回：白马庙刘家村。臭水沟纵横交错。矮破房东倒西歪。人们身上挂着破布条，早上咽菜午嚼糠，夜里碗中照月光。日子真没法过，我们这些人才去当兵跑到台湾，一走就是这些年……
    鞭炮脆响着。乡亲们拥了出来。
    下得车来，哪里还见什么臭水沟。放眼望去，几幢有气派的高楼耸立。走到村中心，只见每户人家都是一幢2层小楼。进得楼里，彩色电视机、地毯、冰箱都有。不少人家装了电话。烧的是煤气罐。看看眼前的青年人，个个红光满面，身强力壮。
    村里宴请这些来客，在敬完家乡的酒之后，热心村的负责人刘模祥笑呵呵地说：“你们走的时候，我不过是七八岁的小伢。今天你们8位叔伯辈乡亲从台湾回来看看，我们十分高兴。你们不光要看看这白马庙的变化，你们还应该去看看大陆好多地方的美好山水、名胜风光。当年你们泡在苦水里，足不出刘家村，去了台湾也没见过北京上海。我们村里决定了，你们休息几天，会过亲朋之后，我们派个人陪你们到外地去观光游览，一切花销统统由我们出……”
      “什么，什么？”8名台胞以为听错了刘模祥的话。
    “你们村里有这多钱供我们去旅游？”刘海平惊诧地问。
      “有的，有的。”副村长刘友水笑着伸出巴掌说：“去年我们村里赚到500万，给国家上交了182万呐！”
    本来想给乡亲们的“救济金”拿不出来了。刘海平没有想到，侄子刘春保硬塞给他8000元钱，说：“你去旅游，这给你零花，爱吃啥吃点，爱买啥就买！”
      “这到底是谁救济谁呐？”刘海平跟回来的伙伴暗暗地说。
         二、第一着高招
    要是不穷折腾，富起来并不难。热心村的这个变化，只不过花去7年的光阴。
    热心村106户人家，统共不过150来亩田地和水塘。1户人家合到亩把田，除去吃的口粮，还能种什么去卖钱？解放以后的30来年，虽然把村名改掉了，但是拔掉贫穷的根子还没有改个村名那么容易。
    1982年，国家建内燃机修造厂，征用了热心村120亩田地，于是给了村里120万元征地费。
    这可是一笔不小的钱财。
    “分掉它！每户有万把元钱，过过富日子。”
    “能进厂去就进厂，不能进厂的靠这钱作本，做买卖去！”
    千人行路有个头。大家都把眼光盯住刘模祥。他40多岁，个子不高，方方的脸上并不因为贫穷而减少笑容。两个大大的眼睛常常闪出一种柔和的光。“这些年我们大伙不是不想把生活搞上去，可总像是水牛掉进井里头，有力使不上。”刘模祥说：“你们想钱，我也想。可是这些钱一分掉，用不了几年，没钱了怎么办？我们农民离开了土地，又没了钱，还想不想活命？”
      “那你说怎么办？”
      “把你们村干部讨论研究的办法亮出来看看！”
    刘模祥温和地看了大家一眼，说：“喝酒看肚量，挑担看肩膀。今天给大家交个底，大家再商量。俗话说：安居才能乐业。祖祖辈辈给我们留下的东倒西歪房子，横七竖八地立着，走路不顺，流水不畅，干脆全部掀翻了它，一行行、一排排规划一下，然后，统一建房，一户一幢二层楼，怎么样？”
      “好！”
      “那要花多少钱？”
      “活儿我们自己来干，拆下旧砖可以填基，只要买新砖、石灰、水泥、钢筋的钱，有50万元就够了。”
      “要是上边有人批你只管窝不治坡咋办？”
      “炒豆大家吃，砸锅一人担。由我去对付上边。”刘模祥笑着说：“余下的70万，我们办厂子。”
      “办厂？能行吗！”
      “咋不行？不会可以学。最早第一代工人不也是农民转化的！我们也可以转。”刘模祥说：“还有30来亩菜地、水塘，能种菜的种，能养鱼的养，再靠办厂来养活全村的老老小小。”
    就在当年，热心村果然盖起了百幢楼。红砖砌筑，上下两层，围起一个小院。南北两行，中间形成了一条街，种上了树，环境幽美，整齐清爽，顿时轰动了南昌市。
    人们纷纷要找刘模祥，他这个想法太妙了，起码热心村以前那种脏乱差完全改观了，就凭这一点电视台记者也不会放过他。
    哪里知道，刘模祥和几个人正在上海进行苦苦的谈判呐！
               三、出墙的红杏
    刘模祥永远忘不了这么一件事：火车在急驰，车厢里像蒸笼，天热口渴，他见有卖水的，小玻璃瓶装，很纯清。他一看，是矿泉水。想：这一瓶水几口可以喝光，矿泉水不就是天然的冷水吗，估计1角钱1瓶吧！他要买1瓶。售货员告诉他：“外汇券1元2角。”“什么？”他怔住了。“这是崂山矿泉水，懂吗！”
    当时他不懂。此刻，在上海他懂了。
    南昌是有名的火炉。三伏天在马路上走一个小时不喝一口水的，可以称做奇人了。南昌冰棒、饮料的生意很好，供不应求。村里有70万元，可以开办个饮料厂。要办厂，就要办个高质量的。于是他和人去上海考察了。住在小弄堂2元钱一夜的统铺里。每天总要喝点汽水。上海汽水品种最多，只有喝了才能比较哪个厂的汽水最好。比下来还是供应公园游客的园林汽水厂的汽水合南昌老表口味。“你们的汽水呱呱叫！”他们去找了这个厂负责人。可以说，没有一个厂领导对夸奖自己产品的话拒绝听取的。感情一下子融洽了。“我们也准备办一个厂，请你们合作怎么样？我们可以支付你们的技术转让费”。精明的上海人被对方的神情所感动，再说汽水生产无机密可保，立即爽快地答应了。
    这时传来一个意外消息：东海舰队有个下属单位，几个技术人员有一项最新科技成果：人工矿化水，专门用来给出海的战士喝的。就是说，用一般洁净的自来水，放在特制的设备里经过特殊处理后，再流出来的水就含有矿泉水所特有的钙、镁、钠等各种成份。毫无疑问，人工矿化水对人体是大有好处的。刘模祥心中电火花一闪。
    火车中自己经历的那一幕又在眼前出现了。矿泉水不能只是外国人的专用品。为什么我们不能把现代科技成果与传统的汽水配方结合起来，生产矿泉水饮料呢？！
    “把这项人工矿泉水的技术买下来，要几万就给几万！”刘模祥拍了板，并且邀上海园林汽水厂技术人员来帮助办厂。
    热心村办起了江西第一家矿泉水饮料厂，厂房设计、布局、设备都是数一数二的。产品叫庐山牌矿泉水饮料，刚上市每瓶价格比别的汽水贵一倍，自然无人问津。
    “人家怎么知道你的货色好呢！连本村的人都不知道嘛！全村每户免费送一箱，让大家品尝品尝味道怎么样。”刘模祥对村长刘琪说：“再准备开一次订货会。”
      “到村里来开吗？”
    “不，南昌最好的宾馆是江西宾馆吧？就在那儿开！”
    “花费太大吧？”
    “要的，新产品打出去不花点宣传费怎么行？你产品好，就要有这个气派。没有自信的厂长怎么搞得好工厂？”
    果然全省的客商来了，邻省的客商也赶来了。人们拿起这些玻璃瓶装的饮料，一喝之后愣住了：甜中略酸，桔子味重；喝下去，口中没有腻味，说明不像别的汽水那样放糖精、香精。价格虽然0.25元一瓶，可是比崂山矿泉水还是便宜，比一般汽水好喝多了。经过化验，产品是用桔子原汁、人工矿泉水、白砂糖制成的，喝了不光解渴，而且对人体有益。
      “我先试销50箱，可以吗？”
      “我订100箱。”
      “我也订100箱，就是有个条件：要快！”
    矿泉水饮料厂正式投产第一年，产值300万，利润税金不下50万。产品获得了省市优质产品奖。第一炮打响了！
    红杏一支出墙来。省市不少记者闻讯，去找刘模祥采访，夸他是出墙的红杏。可是找不见他，他又到上海去了。
        四、借了梯子上高楼
    “现在人们吃讲营养。我们还大有文章可做”。矿泉饮料销路打开之后，刘模祥把村里几个头头召拢来，开起了讨论会。
    村子有了发展，需要几个得力的助手。刘模祥找的刘琪、刘云飞、刘久根、刘友水，都是30来岁高中毕业的年轻人。事业要有大变化，非得有一批能人来经营不可。本来村子是蓑衣绣花底子差，加上刘家村老辈人笃信那种生活方式：“有饭有窝冬有火，除了神仙就是我”，至于吃的是什么饭、住的是什么窝，并不去计较，要革掉这种自满自足的旧习，一定得有年轻的有文化的一代人来领头攻坚。
    “男朋友看未来的丈母娘，朋友去探望亲属，子女孝敬父母，现在都作兴的是送蜂皇浆。我们为什么不能搞一个营养补剂厂呢？”
    “对，有道理，把矿泉水饮料厂赚的钱投资进去，鸡生蛋，蛋生鸡。”
      “还是找上海，那里有好多科技人员，有先进设备，我们可以借了梯子爬高楼。”
    上海是个人才济济的地方。人才太集中了，任何一个科研成果要转化到生产上去，却不是三下五除二那么轻易实现的。刘模祥看准了大城市里才能有的这个“特殊性”。“我们这叫八面请诸葛、四方借东风，不能白要人家的。脑力劳动的产物值大钱，我们花几万元现成买来，马上可以变成一项新产品，这叫吃小亏占大便宜！”
    他满脸笑呵呵地走进了“上海中医营养食疗研究会”和有关的药厂请能人到热心村去看看，不光用高价买下技术，还请他们把技术变成产品。要添置什么设备，设备怎么安装才呱呱叫，原料哪里去采购，怎么按顺序加工，产品怎么包装，他都听这些专家的。开始上“蜂乳”的时候，需要厂房。刘模祥指指村办旅社的那幢楼说：“我们这个村前边离车站远，后边离市区远，这个招待所没起多少作用，改掉它，搞产业，作营养补剂厂厂房。”
      “招待所每天多少也有二三百元进帐呐！”
      “塞牙缝都不够。厂搞起来几百万、上千万进来，那才过瘾呐！”
    说改就改，不用左批右审，拖泥带水。设备安装起来了，产品很快一个接一个出来了。不久，他们看到社会上独生子女多，年轻父母都盼望自己孩子长得健康。他们又去请教专家，结果生产出“鸡胚宝宝素”，作为一种冲剂，甜津津的，含有多种维生素，放在牛奶、豆浆、稀粥里都可以，不是糖、胜过糖，孩子吃了增加食欲，有利于发育。
    就这样，营养补剂厂、儿童营养补剂厂办起来了，产品出了20多个，这几个厂创造了5000多万产值。矿泉水饮料厂和这两个厂都需要包装纸，又办起了一个装璜彩印厂，去年有800万产值。厂子办一个成一个，产品出来一个就得到一片称赞。“鸡胚宝宝素”还得了国家级3次金奖。穷得叮当响的白马庙刘家村106户人家，已经发展到有6000多万产值，利润近千万的热心村，以人均计在全国屈指可数。
    这时有人对刘模祥说：“辛苦了这几年，可以歇口气了吧！”
    “让我们成了亿元村之后。”刘模祥笑着说。这个人真有一股预知未来的本事。还是在1987年的时候，他就对村干部说了一番如今让人拍手叫绝的话：“不是讲船小好掉头嘛！不错，村级企业是中国最小的船了，掉起头来要快便点。不过，一来了风浪，船小可受不住，要掉头也来不及了。航空母舰什么风浪也不怕。我们村也得搞个‘航空母舰’。”刘模祥说完，看了大伙一眼，大家疑惑地盯住了他。
      “办个大药厂！现在社会上退休的专家有的是，请来就是。药厂原料是玉米，玉米中国多得很。我问过人了，生产土霉素碱，正是国际上的缺档货。”
    第二天，原江西江南制药厂厂长李本堂工程师家里来了几位不速不客：“李厂长，退休在家心烦，到我们那儿去当顾问办厂吧，我们要办个大药厂。”
      “你们有这能力？”
      “有！我们已经请了化工机械厂退下来的总工程师，他会负责办理设备；你只需要负责全厂的药物生产就行……”
      “好极了！”李本堂挥挥胳臂：“我正愁有力无处使呐！”
    规模宏大的“洪城药厂”立即破土动工。第一期工程投资1500万，一年就完成了。日产土霉素碱700公斤，出口到西德、葡萄牙等国家，年产值达到1900万。现在第二期工程又上马了。
    如今别的企业因为银行不贷款，“掉了头”也不顶用，纷纷停产。到热心村来买货的客商，却带了钱还未必能买得到货。
     五、“热心”人的新思维
    富起来的热心人，近些年“怪”事迭出。
    “怪”事之一　一张布告张贴在南昌的大街小巷：南昌市营养补剂厂、儿童营养补剂厂、矿泉水饮料厂、洪城药厂、新欣装璜彩印厂公开招工，凡南昌市城镇户口，有初中以上文化水平身体健康者均可报名，经过考试，量才选用，工资按照国家规定发给，奖金按效益发给。报名者请到南昌市郊区热心村委会……
    自古以来只有农村青年往城里跑，现在到好，农村向城市招工，而且还要经过考试。报名者络绎不绝。终于，热心村“引进”1000多名城市青年，到各个企业当工人。
    “怪”事之二　刘模祥跑了几十里路来到南昌县罗家集乡，找到了乡政府。乡领导早就慕名，在恭候了。
    刘模祥摸出了“阿诗玛”，给对方一支，自己也点燃了火。
      “说吧，有何贵干！”长长呼出一口烟，对方催促刘模祥快打开闷葫芦。
      “你们这里还有不少荒地，怎么样，卖点给我们？”刘模祥直通通地说。
      “你们要买地？”对方吃一惊：“买多少？”
      “100亩，怎么样？”
      “出多少钱？”
      “按国家规定办，决不少一分一厘。”
      “嗬，真有你的！”
    罗家集乡让出100亩荒坡地，刘模祥付出130万元。一切手续办妥之后，他马上调出劳动力，把荒地犁翻，然后养猪、种菜、饲鸡鸭，挖塘养鱼，刘模祥把这儿作为热心村的农副产品生产基地，负责解决在热心村干活的人农副产品的供应。
      “人家在我们厂里拚命干活，哪有时间去排队买菜买肉买鱼呢！买不到吃不上，哪有心思干好活！”刘模祥笑呵呵地说：“人心都是肉长的，我们要照顾到家。办这么一个小农场，就解决了我们职工的后顾之忧。每天下午把菜送来，每人1斤；每月供应每人4斤肉、2斤鱼、2斤蛋、3只鸡、1只鸭和定量大米，统统不要钱！只要大伙能够吃好、吃顺心，多干点活出来，这点钱都收回来了。”
    有记者问道：“这得花多少钱？”
    “一年也不过四五十万，小意思。”
    又有记者问他：“你抽的‘阿诗玛’挺贵的，客人来了又要给人抽，怎么办？” 
    “这好办。”刘模祥点起了烟，“自己掏钱就是了。我们村里的干部抽烟，村里一分也不报销。干部每年收入最多4800元，拿我来说，一大半是给这烟烧掉的。”
    “怪”事之三　有人找到刘模祥：“原先户口在我们村的周香仔，‘文革’中给赶到了三家村去了，如今70来岁孤寡老人一个，每天靠拣垃圾过日子哩！”
      “是真的？”刘模祥屏住了呼吸，收敛了笑容。“人都会老的。赶快把她收回来，我们村上把她养起来！”
    周香仔做梦也没有想到，有人会把她接回去，每个月给她66元“退休”金。她第一次拿到这些票子时，泪水从混浊的眼里滚落了下来。
    从此热心村作了个硬规定：凡是年过60岁的老人不用干活了，一律拿退休金，从66元到90元不等。今年春上天气特别冷，每个老人的家里房门给敲响了，一床床羽绒被子送来了，“是村上给你们老人家的，你们盖了就不怕冷了。”
    去年夏天，南昌热到40多度，热死病死不少人，多数属老人。可是热心村的老人没有一个发病的，因为他们都被刘模祥安排在小庐山避暑，所花的钱统统由村里开支。老人下山后，已是天凉了，个个乐得合不拢嘴。
      “共产党最应该讲尊老爱幼，最应当懂得人道主义嘛！”刘模祥说：“花无千日红。老人累死累活了几十年，现在让他们心宽一下，心宽出少年唦！”
    刘模祥的“老人政策”收到意想不到的奇效。哪一个后生要是干活迟到早退、吊儿郎当，回到家老人就会劈头盖脸地教训他：“良心给狗吞啦！”这个村，这些年没有发生一起赌博、偷盗、打架斗殴之类的事，只要有几个人围坐着，扑克、钞票刚掏出来，老人就会从中插一横杠：“看电视、学课本啥不能做，要干这个？！你们瞎了眼啦，刘克农那伢子考上大学村里奖1000元，怎么不向好的学？”村里来了不三不四的人，家家户户老人会自动监控，立即拿起电话报告。厂里自然也设安全保卫联防队之类，那是为了防止外边人进村来偷摸抢骗的。
      “怪”事之四　“一人踩倒地下草，众人踏出阳光道。”刘模祥想出了一条妙策：“官府民办”。单是退职的工程师就有20多人在村里帮忙，他还希望大学毕业生和别单位的能人都来他村里干。但现在的社会还是处在社会主义初级阶段，人们的潜意识里少不了个“编制”，大学毕业生进村办企业，编制在村里，偌大的中国至今还数不出几个来。照顾一下科技人员的这种心态，搞一个科技发展公司，挂钩在南昌市郊区政府的科委里，编制就是国营的了，但是工资、奖金、医疗费、办公费等等一切由村里支付，科委每年还可以从村里分享一点“管理费”。假如科技人员要走，由科委调动，就不怕铁饭碗砸烂。亏他刘模祥想得出官府民办这一招，果然一家伙吸收了30多个能人进来，去年两个大学毕业生也进来了，国营的编制，村办企业里干活，拿村办企业的奖金，去年每个人单奖金有二三千元。“你总要从实际出发嘛！我们又没吃亏，还顾全了科技人员的面子和退路，这办法灵着哩！”
    最近刘模祥又在想新的点子了：办稀土厂。稀土是有色金属，号称下一个世纪登上社会生活各个领域的奇妙的搀合剂。江西有丰富的稀土资源。这个厂开始破土动工了。
      刘模祥带领全村人总是在搏击，在向前冲刺……
