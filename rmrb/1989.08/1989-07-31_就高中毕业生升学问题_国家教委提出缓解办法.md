Recently, the State Education Commission issued a notice to local education departments. The notice states that this year's enrollment plan for regular higher education institutions has been adjusted, which may affect the admission rates of senior high school graduates in some regions. To alleviate this contradiction, local areas can adopt the following measures based on specific situations:

1.	Appropriately increase the enrollment plan for regular undergraduate programs in television universities. When increasing the enrollment for television university undergraduate programs, consideration should be given to the quality of the student intake, the conditions for running the programs, and the funding available. It is also important to consider the potential for employment placement after graduation.

	The number of additional enrollments should be strictly controlled within the range of the reduced enrollment numbers for regular higher education institutions in each region.

2.	Currently, secondary vocational schools and secondary normal schools that enroll senior high school graduates can, as a special case this year, continue to enroll senior high school graduates. Schools that have decided to enroll junior high school graduates will not change back to enrolling senior high school graduates.

3.	When adjusting enrollment plans, regions and departments should pay attention to maintaining a balance between the number of students enrolled in liberal arts and science programs. They should avoid the tendency to only reduce the enrollment of liberal arts programs. For liberal arts majors that have a high social demand, clear educational direction, and good conditions for running the programs, a certain number of enrollments should be maintained.

4.	Without the approval of the State Education Commission, any worker's college, farmer's college, or management cadre academy, and other adult higher education institutions, are not allowed to enroll senior high school graduates from society.

    就高中毕业生升学问题  国家教委提出缓解办法
    本报北京7月31日讯　最近，国家教委向各地教育部门发出通知。通知说，今年普通高等学校招生计划调整，对部分地区的应届高中毕业生升学率可能有一些影响。为了缓解这一矛盾，各地可根据具体情况，采取下列办法：
    一、适当增加电视大学普通专科班的招生计划。增加电大普通专科班的招生，要考虑到生源质量、办学条件及办学经费等项条件，也应充分考虑到学生毕业后就业安排的可能。
    增加招生计划的数量，应严格控制在各地普通高校招生调减数范围内。
    二、现在中等专业学校、中等师范学校招收高中毕业生的，今年作为特殊情况，可维持招收高中毕业生。已决定改招初中毕业生的学校，不再改招高中毕业生。
    三、各地区、各部门在调整招生计划时，要注意文科和理科招生数之间的相对平衡，要避免仅减文科招生的倾向。对社会需求量大、办学方向明确、办学条件较好的应用性文科专业，要保持一定的招生数量。
    四、未经国家教委批准，任何职工高等学校、农民高等学校、管理干部学院等成人高校，仍不得面向社会招收高中毕业生。
