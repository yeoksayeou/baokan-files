The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Politburo decided to focus on seven key issues that are of great concern to the people in the near future. This news, once announced, spread like a strong wind across the country. From this series of special reports by some of our reporters, you can feel a great force.

These issues must be addressed immediately
August 1. The meeting room of the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee. An unusual discussion was taking place: the Central Committee has decided to focus on seven key issues that are of great concern to the people in the near future, how should we proceed?

The atmosphere was both heated and serious. An old comrade said: "The children of leaders at the vice-provincial level and above who are engaged in business, I know of quite a few, some are in the country, some are abroad, some are sons, and some are grandsons. If you include those at the bureau level, there would be even more."

"Such a situation must be changed!" The Standing Committee members listed some thought-provoking facts: Every time the provincial leadership holds a meeting, some bureaus have several leaders each sitting in different cars, causing the venue inside and outside to be filled with cars. During the latest meeting, because the cars were parked on the road, traffic was blocked for 15 minutes. These issues, if not addressed immediately, how can they be resolved!

Do more practical work and less empty talk. Integrity must be practical. Some comrades suggested that housing issues should also be included in the integrity measures. The housing conditions of workers are severely unequal, but some leaders see a new house and want it, and even after moving into a new house, they do not give up the old one!

There are many things to do, and they are very difficult. Where is the difficulty? The Standing Committee members pointed out that the difficulty lies in the leadership, not in the lower levels. Because every integrity measure, when it is introduced, inevitably touches the personal interests of some leading cadres...

The meeting decided to do a few things that will gain the trust of the people in the near future. Li Zichi said: "These things, no matter how difficult, must be done, the more difficult, the better they must be done!"

Leaders must take the lead in enforcing discipline
July 28, after the Central Television broadcast the decision to focus on seven key issues in the near future, the secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, Sun Weiben, was excited. He asked the secretary of the provincial party committee to immediately notify the standing committee members and party member vice-governors that when they go to various places to participate in organizational life meetings, they must include the handling of disciplinary cases of leading cadres as an important agenda item. The Central Committee is focusing on seven key issues, and we must be even bolder in our actions!

This year, Heilongjiang investigated 18 major cases and publicly handled seven cases involving bureau-level cadres, relying on the provincial party committee secretaries taking the lead. Take the investigation of the "old difficult problem" - the case of embezzlement of 500,000 yuan and a loss of 4 million yuan by the provincial International Cultural Exchange Center, for example. In 1987, the provincial party committee dispatched vice-secretary Zhou Wenhua and vice-governor Du Xianzhong to "handle" the case. The other side, relying on the fact that the person in charge of the center was a provincial-level cadre, threatened to "appeal to the emperor." During the period when the manager of the Longhuan Company of the center, Yu Shaojiang, was under investigation, the person in charge of the center appointed him as the deputy general manager of another company...

The investigation team was intimidated. Sun Weiben, Zhou Wenhua, and others expressed: "We must resolutely handle this according to the law!"

The Central Committee has shown its determination, and the several secretaries have more confidence. Therefore, the provincial party committee's tight-drum beating to crack down on major cases has become even more intense.

On July 29, Governor Shaoji Hui convened a meeting with the leaders of the provincial supervision bureau to discuss major cases while inspecting Fujin County; Vice Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Wang Haiyan talked with the person in charge of the International Economic and Technological Cooperation Company to investigate serious economic problems; and the standing committee member of the provincial discipline inspection commission drafted a plan to investigate the problems of 123 cadres at the county level and above.

On July 30, the provincial party committee notified the local party committees to discuss the public handling of seven bureau-level cadres, using one to reflect on many, and exposing corruption problems in their own units and regions.

On July 31, the provincial party committee formally approved the plan to investigate the problems of 123 cadres at the county level and above. On the same day, the province deployed a meeting to investigate the construction and allocation of houses by leading cadres for personal gain.

On August 2, at 5:30 PM, after a day of standing committee meetings, the secretaries drank water, ate fried bread, and gathered around to have a working dinner, focusing on studying how to ensure the implementation of the investigation of 123 cadres. Facing a pile of problems, the provincial party committee secretary sighed: "Now it is difficult to expose problems, difficult to file a case, difficult to gather evidence, difficult to close a case, and even more difficult to handle! Many cases, if the superior leaders do not take the lead, are difficult to handle. But to punish corruption, who else can play the role of Judge Bao if the leaders do not?"

The key is to take action
July 29, in front of a newspaper stand on the streets of Zhengzhou, a reporter asked a middle-aged man who was reading the newspaper intently: "What do you think of the seven things the Central Committee wants to do?" The middle-aged man replied: "The seven things are all practical. But it's not about how it's said, the key is how it's done."

The key is to take action. The leaders of Henan Province also understand it this way.

During the hottest days of this summer, from July 16 to 18, Governor Cheng Weigao and two vice-governors led 25 bureau-level leaders to Xinyang to hold a working meeting. The journey from the provincial capital to Xinyang is hundreds of kilometers, and there was no grand procession of cars, with all leaders taking the train. During the meeting, no local subsidies were accepted, from the governor to the staff, everyone ate a set meal, and each person paid 0.5 kilograms of grain tickets and 5.5 yuan for meals. Local cadres all went home to eat. No fruits, drinks, or cigarettes were served during the meeting.

From July 26 to 28, the provincial industrial conference with 5,000 representatives did not gather in the provincial capital, but was held in 17 cities and prefectures, watching the TV broadcast locally.

These two seemingly small actions were seen by local cadres and the masses; those not in the local area saw and heard them through the media. Thus, there were joyful discussions...

A Communist Party member named Zhao Wenfu said: From this, I see the hope of integrity.

The central government sets an example, and the grassroots level is even more enthusiastic
Xi'an City's Xincheng District is a pilot area for the construction of integrity systems by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee. In recent days, the most heated topic here has been the "seven things" that the Central Committee wants to do.

The straightforward deputy instructor of the Xiyilu Subdistrict Office, Fan Gang, commented: Integrity construction requires high transparency. In the past, our subdistrict office solved the problem of "agricultural to non-agricultural" household registration, and the indicators were never published. Those with connections and influence could solve the problem first. This year, the policy, procedures, indicators, processes, and results of "agricultural to non-agricultural" were made public, and the results were handed over to the public supervision team for evaluation. In the first half of the year, 12 households with 21 people were solved, and most of them were ordinary residents. The 33 people reported by the provincial government office did not meet the conditions according to the regulations, and none were solved.

The party branch secretary of the Xisanlu Housing Management Office, Liu Changwen, held up their "Public Affairs Handling Regulations Handbook" and stated solemnly: "The Central Committee has set an example, and we grassroots leaders are even more enthusiastic about integrity construction." The Housing Management Office deals with the public every day. In the past, the handling procedures were not complete and not public, plus the sluggish work style and some people's eating, drinking, and extortion, the residents had many complaints. Now, the handling procedures are made public, and there are almost no complaints and appeals, and many long-standing "old difficult problems" have also been solved.

Ensuring the right to supervision, what "protective layer" can't penetrate
The Central Committee's announcement of the seven things to be done in the near future immediately made the Tianjin Economic Crime Reporting Center, which had just been established for a week, bustling. A mother brought her son, who had been living in fear day and night, to the door and handed over 20,000 yuan that her son had embezzled.

In the past year, the center has received 6,445 leads of various types, with economic crime leads accounting for 73.2%. After filing a case for investigation, 89 people were arrested, and 7.46 million yuan in illegal gains and items were seized, breaking several cases of embezzlement and bribery involving tens of millions of yuan. However, the procuratorial officials are still pondering a question: There are still very few major and important cases involving leading cadres...

Prosecutor Tao Yimin revealed to the reporter: The municipal court recently established a major case investigation team, screened 11 important leads as key cases, and first handled several cases in county-level and above party and government agencies.

Anti-corruption requires the enthusiasm of the masses. To protect the masses' reporting, the city has handled 6 cases of retaliation against reporters and rewarded a batch of meritorious reporters.

The director of the municipal people's congress standing committee, Wu Zhen, said: The right to supervision of the people is guaranteed, and what "protective layer" can't penetrate!

    鼓起清廉之风
    ——甘肃黑龙江河南陕西天津五省市见闻
    本报记者
    中共中央政治局全体会议决定，近期做好人民群众关心的七件事情。这个消息公布后，有如长风，鼓荡神州。从本报部分记者采写的这组特写中，你可以感受到一种巨大的力量。
     这些事，再不抓怎么得了
    8月1日。甘肃省委常委会会议室。不寻常的一场讨论在进行着：中央决定近期做七件群众关心的实事，我们怎么干？
    空气热烈而严肃。一位老同志说：“副省级以上的领导干部子女经商，仅我知道的就不少，有在国内的，有在国外的，有儿子辈的，还有孙子辈的。如果把厅局长级的算上，就更多了。”
    “这种状况非改变不可了！”常委们在罗列着一些发人深省的事实：省上每次召开领导干部大会，有些厅局有几个头头就分坐几辆车，弄得会场内外车满为患。最近一次开会，因汽车停靠在马路上，阻塞交通达15分钟之久。这些事，再不抓怎么得了！
    多办实事，少说空话。廉政就应当抓实的。有一些同志建议，住房问题也要列入廉政措施。职工住房严重苦乐不均，可是一些领导见了新房就要，住上新房老房还不退！
    要办的事很多，又很难。难在哪里？常委们指出，难就难在领导层，而不是难在下面。因为，每项廉政措施的出台，都不可避免地要触动一些领导干部的自身利益呀……会议决定，近期内做几件取信于民的实事。李子奇说：“这些事，再难也要去办，越难越要办好！”
　（张述圣）
    领导人不扮黑脸包公谁扮
    7月28日，中央电视台播出中央近期要抓7件事的决定后，黑龙江省委书记孙维本兴奋了。他请省委秘书长立即通知常委和党员副省长，到各地参加组织生活会时，要把抓领导干部违纪案作为重要议题。中央抓7件事，我们要更大胆地干！
    今年，黑龙江查处18起大案，近期公开处理7个厅局级干部，靠的是省委书记们披挂上阵。就说查处“老大难”——省国际文化交流中心贪污50万元和亏损400万元的这个案件吧，1987年，省委派副书记周文华和副省长杜显忠“包”案。对方仗着中心负责人是省级干部，扬言“告御状”。在中心的龙环公司经理于绍江已处于被审查期间，中心负责人又让其到另一公司任副总经理之职……办案人员发怵了。孙维本、周文华等表示：“要坚决按法律办事！”
    中央表明了决心，几位书记更有信心。于是，省委狠抓大案要案的紧锣密鼓敲得更响。
    7月29日，省长邵奇惠在考察富锦县途中召集省监察厅领导研究大案要案；省委副书记王海彦为查处国际经济技术合作公司的严重经济问题，与该公司负责人谈话；省纪委常委草拟审查123名县以上干部问题的方案。
    7月30日，省委通知各地党委，对公开处理7个厅局级干部进行讨论，举一反三，揭发本单位、本地区的腐败问题。
    7月31日，省委正式批准审查123名县以上干部的方案。同一天，全省部署清查领导干部建房分房中以权谋私的会议召开。
    8月2日，下午五点半，开了一天常委会的书记们喝开水、吃烤饼，围在一起进工作晚餐，抓紧研究如何保证审查123名干部的实施问题。面对成堆的问题，省委书记无限感慨：“现在揭发问题难，立案难，取证难，结案难，处理更难！许多案子，上级领导不出面不好办。可是，要惩治腐败，领导人不扮黑脸包公谁扮！”　（武培真）
       关键是做起来
    7月29日，在郑州街头一架阅报栏前，记者问一名专心看报的中年人：“你对中央要做的7件事怎样看？”中年人回答：“7件事件件实在。但不能看说得怎样，关键要看做得怎样。”
    关键是做。河南省领导也这样理解。
    今夏最炎热的7月16至18日，省长程维高和2名副省长率25名厅局长到信阳召开办公会议。省城到信阳行程数百公里，一路没有浩浩荡荡的车队，所有领导一律坐火车。会议期间不要地方补贴1分钱，从省长到工作人员一律吃份饭，每人每天交0.5公斤粮票、5.5元伙食费。当地干部统统回家吃饭。会议期间不摆水果、饮料、香烟。
    7月26日至28日的全省工业会议，5000名代表没有云集省城，而是分散在17个地市就地收看电视转播。
    这两件不大不小的举动，当地干部群众亲眼看到了；不在当地的，通过新闻媒介看到、听到了。于是，就有了欣喜的议论……
    一位名叫赵文甫的共产党员说：从这里我看到了廉政的希望。　（李而亮）
    中央做表率，基层劲头就更足了
    西安市新城区是陕西省委、西安市委抓的廉政制度建设试点。连日来，这里议论最热烈的就是中央要做的“七件事”。
    心直口快的西一路派出所副教导员樊刚评述：廉政建设要透明度高。我们派出所过去解决“农转非”户口，指标从来不公布，门道大、有脸面的人就能优先解决。今年将“农转非”的政策、手续、指标、程序、结果五公开，并且交给群众监督员评议。上半年解决12户21人迁入户口，大都是普通居民。省政府大院申报的33人，按规定不够条件，一个也没有解决。
    西三路房管所党支部书记刘长文，拿着他们的《公开办事制度手册》，一板一眼地陈述：“中央做出表率，我们基层领导抓廉政建设劲头就更足了。”房管所天天与群众打交道。过去办事制度不健全也不公开，加上作风拖拉和个别人吃喝卡要，住房户意见很大。现在公开办事制度，上访告状的基本没了，许多拖了多年的“老大难”问题也得到解决。

         保障监督权，什么“保护层”穿不透
    中央政治局公布近期要做的7件事，使恰好成立1周年的天津经济罪案举报中心顿时热闹起来。一位母亲带着她日夜心惊胆颤度日的儿子，登门交出了儿子贪污的2万元钱。
    举报工作开展一年来，这里共收各类线索6445件，经济犯罪线索占73.2％，经立案侦查，逮捕89人，追缴赃款赃物计746万余元，破获几宗贪污受贿数十万元的大案。然而，检察机关干部还在深思着一个问题：真正涉及领导干部的大案、要案，还寥寥无几……陶毅民检察长向记者透露：市院最近成立了大案侦查队，筛选了11件重要线索做为重点，并且先办出在县处级以上党政机关的几个案件。
    反腐败，需要有群众的热情。为了保护群众举报，市里已对6起打击报复举报人的事件作了处理，还奖励了一批举报的有功人员。
    市人大常委会主任吴振说：保障了人民的监督权，什么“保护层”穿不透！　（肖荻）
