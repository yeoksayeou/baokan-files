Qatari youth Saleh Hassan Shameeri left Kuwait on August 16th riding a camel, continuing his second global journey, which will take him to Beijing in 30 months.

Saleh's journey began in July from the Saudi Arabian holy city of Mecca. He arrived in Kuwait on August 6th and will travel 25,000 kilometers, passing through Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, before finally reaching Beijing.

Before his departure, he told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the main purpose of his trip is to promote peace in the countries he visits.

He said that during his journey, he will meet with leaders of various countries, visit the elderly, youth, orphans, and disabled people to understand their way of life, and prepare to write travelogues about how these countries serve these people.

The 32-year-old Saleh was previously a set designer at the Qatari television station. Two years ago, he quit his job and began his first global camel ride journey.

Saleh's wife, Najat, said that her husband's global journey is a "noble cause." Although Arab traditions prevent her from accompanying her husband on the journey, and despite the many difficulties this will bring to the family, she still supports him.

    卡塔尔青年骑骆驼来北京
    卡塔尔青年萨勒赫·哈桑·谢迈里16日骑骆驼离开科威特，继续他的第2次环球旅行，30个月后将抵北京。
    萨勒赫的这次旅行是7月份从沙特阿拉伯圣城麦加开始的。他于8月6日来到科威特，并将行程25000公里，经伊拉克、土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦，最后抵达北京。
    他在临行前对新华社记者说，他此行的主要目的是到他所访问的各个国家宣传和平。
    他说，在旅行中，他将拜会各国领导人，看望老人、青年、孤儿和残疾人，以了解他们的生活方式，并准备写一些国家如何为这些人提供服务的游记。
    今年32岁的萨勒赫以前曾是卡塔尔电视台的布景工程师。两年前，他辞去了工作并开始了他的第一次骑骆驼环球旅行。
    萨勒赫的妻子纳吉特说，丈夫的环球旅行是“高尚的事业”，尽管由于阿拉伯传统习俗不能陪同丈夫同游，尽管这将给家庭带来许多困难，但她还是支持他。　（据新华社）
