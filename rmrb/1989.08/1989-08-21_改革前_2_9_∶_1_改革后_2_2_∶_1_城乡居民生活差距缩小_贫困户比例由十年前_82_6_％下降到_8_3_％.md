The gap between urban and rural residents' living standards has narrowed from 2.9:1 before the reform to 2.2:1. According to statistics, from 1978 to 1988, the living consumption level of farmers increased by an average of 9.7% per year, while urban residents saw an average increase of 5.6% per year, indicating that the living standards of farmers improved faster than those of urban residents.

It is the reform and opening-up policy that has brought about unprecedented changes in the lives of farmers. In 1988, the national average net income of farmers reached 545 yuan, an increase of 411 yuan compared to ten years ago. Calculated at comparable prices, the average annual growth rate was 11.8%. Currently, according to the national poverty standard of per capita net income below 150 yuan, which has been raised to below 200 yuan, the proportion of poor households in rural areas has decreased from 82.6% ten years ago to 8.3%. Meanwhile, out of every 100 rural households, 47 have a per capita net income of over 500 yuan.

The long-held dream of "eating fine grains, living in new houses, and wearing new clothes" has now become a reality for many farmers. Today, out of every 5 kilograms of grain consumed by farmers, 4.075 kilograms are rice and flour, whereas ten years ago, more than half of their grain consumption was coarse grains. Meat, poultry, eggs, fish, and shrimp are no longer rare on the tables of rural families. Last year, the consumption of sideline products by farmers exceeded that of staple foods. Currently, each farmer consumes an average of 2627 kilocalories per day, an increase of 416 kilocalories compared to ten years ago, approaching the level of middle-income countries in 1980. In terms of housing, over the past decade, 75 out of every 100 rural households have built new houses, and the per capita living space has increased from 8 square meters to 17 square meters.

In terms of durable consumer goods, on average, 31 out of every 100 rural households own a television. Color televisions, double-door refrigerators, motorcycles, cameras, and washing machines have also started to appear in rural homes. The average savings of each farmer in banks and credit unions have increased from 7 yuan ten years ago to over 200 yuan, and it is estimated that they hold about 100 billion yuan in cash. Currently, more than half of the purchasing power in society is held by farmers, and more than 60% of retail social commodities are sold in rural areas. This indicates that the 800 million farmers have provided a vast and potential market for the development of the national economy.

    改革前——2.9∶1　改革后——2.2∶1
    城乡居民生活差距缩小
    贫困户比例由十年前82.6％下降到8.3％
    据新华社北京8月21日电  （记者焦然）我国城乡人民的生活差距已由改革前的2.9∶1缩小到2.2∶1。据统计，从1978年至1988年，按可比价格计算，农民生活消费水平平均每年提高9.7％，而城市居民则平均每年提高5.6％，农民生活水平提高的速度快于市民生活水平提高的速度。
    是改革开放使农民生活发生了改革前难以想象的巨大变化。1988年全国农民人均纯收入达545元，比10年前增加411元，按可比价格计算，平均每年增长11.8％。目前，按国家贫困户标准由人均纯收入150元以下提高到人均200元以下计算，全国农村贫困户占农户总数的比例由10年前的82.6％下降到8.3％；同时，每100户农民，已有47户人均纯收入在500元以上。
    “吃细粮、住新房、穿新衣”，这种长期被亿万农家当成奢望的生活，如今神话般地降临在头上。农民每吃5公斤粮食中，就有4.075公斤是大米、白面，而10年前一半以上是粗粮；肉、禽、蛋、鱼、虾上餐桌在农家已不稀罕，去年全国农民副食品消费额已大于主食消费额。现在每个农民每天摄入的热量为2627千卡，比10年前增加416千卡，已接近中等收入国家1980年的水平。在住房上，10年来，每100户农民就有75户盖了新房，人均住房由8平方米增加到17平方米。
    在高档耐用消费品方面，平均每100个农户就有31户有电视机。彩色电视、双门电冰箱、摩托车、照相机、洗衣机也都开始在农家使用。平均每个农民在银行、信用社的储蓄已由10年前的7元，增加到200元以上；此外，估计他们手持现金有1000亿元左右。目前，全社会一半以上的购买力在农民那里，零售社会商品60％以上销向农村。这表明，8亿农民已为国民经济发展提供了一个广阔的、有潜力的巨大市场。
