The Tengwang Pavilion, which has stood for over 1,300 years and has been rebuilt several times, now stands proudly on the north bank of the Gan River. With its poetic lines "The setting sun and lone wild ducks fly together, the autumn water and long sky blend into one," it is a treasure of historical and cultural significance in the city of Nanchang. Along with the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou Memorial Hall in the south, which houses the works of Zhu Da, known for his "crying and laughing" style, the Qingliang Terrace in the west, and the "August 1st Uprising Memorial Hall" in the city center, these sites are the jewels of Nanchang's tourism.

Heading north from Nanchang, one can reach Jiujiang, known as the "Hub of Nine Provinces." In the cool world of Mount Lu, the steep cliffs, changing clouds, misty waterfalls, and winter snowscapes are breathtaking. The Three-Falls Waterfall splashes like jade, the Cloud Path in the Brocade Valley is enchanting, the Donglin Temple is the origin of the Pure Land sect, and the inscriptions on the peaks are numerous, offering endless enjoyment for visitors.

Descending from Mount Lu, one can travel east from Jiujiang by car to the world-renowned "Porcelain Capital," Jingdezhen, to appreciate ancient porcelain. Heading south to Yingtan, one can visit the birthplace of Taoism, Longhushan, and enjoy the scenic beauty similar to that of Guilin's Li River. One can also explore the mysteries of the ancient cliff tombs from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.

Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Jiangxi Province's tourism industry has developed rapidly. With 38 international tourist hotels, over 4,400 standard beds, and 43 travel agencies, Jiangxi's tourism system hosted 4.5 times more overseas tourists in 1988 than in 1978, and the foreign exchange earnings were 8 times higher. Jiangxi Province, like a green leaf fluttering on the map of China, is now dotted with tourist attractions, sparkling with gems. Climbing Mount Jinggang, one can relive the arduous journey of the founding of New China, admire the Longtan Waterfall, enjoy the sea of clouds at Huangyangjie, and wander through the ten-mile stretch of wild azaleas. Ascending Mount Sanqing, one cannot help but marvel at the praise "Surpassing the Five Sacred Mountains, the best scenery is on Mount Sanqing." In the spring, one can ascend Tongtian Rock to overlook the southern metropolis of Ganzhou; in the winter, one can listen to the calls of the world's largest flock of wintering white cranes in the natural reserve of Poyang Lake. For those who still yearn for more, there is the "Fireworks Capital of China," Pingxiang City, the famous Buddhist mountain of Yunju in Southeast Asia, and the ancient pass of Dayu Meiling, which controls the throat of Guangdong and Jiangxi, all eagerly welcoming visitors.

    山水美如画  人在画中游
    经1300余年历史烟云、几经兴废今又重立于城北赣江之滨的滕王阁，以其“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”的诗情，与城南八大山人纪念馆中朱耷“哭之笑之”的画意，城西北西山万寿宫的清境，以及城中的“八一起义纪念馆”，堪称历史文化名城南昌的旅游珍宝。
    从南昌北上，可到素有“九省通衢”之称的九江。在庐山这个清凉世界里，奇峰险崖、变云幻雾、飞瀑银泉和冬春雪景蔚为壮观。三叠泉瀑布溅玉，锦绣谷云中栈道，东林寺净土宗源，秀峰碑刻如林，任人尽兴畅游。
    下得庐山，从九江乘车东进，便能到举世闻名的“瓷都”景德镇访古购瓷。南下鹰潭，进入中国道教发源地龙虎山，还能欣赏到类似桂林漓江的山水风光，并一探春秋战国时代遗下的“古崖墓群之秘”。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，江西省旅游事业发展迅速。拥有38家涉外旅游饭店、4400多张标准床位和43家各类旅行社的江西旅游系统，1988年接待海外游客相当于1978年的4.5倍，创汇额相当于1978年的8倍。在祖国版图上飘逸如一片绿叶的江西省，旅游胜地已星罗棋布，满目珠玑。上井冈山，除了重温新中国诞生的艰难历程外，还能观龙潭瀑布，赏黄洋界云海，流连于十里野生杜鹃林带之中。登三清山，使人无法不叹服“揽胜遍五岳，绝景在三清”的赞誉。春到赣州，可攀通天岩眺赣南重镇；冬去鄱湖，可聆听候鸟自然保护区中世界最大的越冬白鹤群引颈和鸣。意犹未尽时，还有中国烟花之乡萍乡市，东南亚佛教名山云居山，扼粤赣咽喉古关所在地大余梅岭等，都将伸出双臂热情欢迎人们的到来。    （吕峻　孙琳娜）
