Wuhan's tax authorities, in collaboration with the city's taxi management department, have implemented source control on tax collection for individual taxi services, strengthening management and achieving significant results. The average annual tax burden for small taxi services has increased from 589.92 yuan to 2104.80 yuan, a 2.57-fold increase.

In recent years, the management of tax collection for individual taxi services in Wuhan has been chaotic, resulting in substantial tax revenue losses. Starting from last September, the city's individual taxi services have been managed jointly by the Jiang'an District Tax Bureau and the Wuhan Taxi Management Office. They have re-registered for tax purposes and submitted tax declarations, established systems for the use of invoices and handling of violations, and strengthened inspection and enforcement. In just May and June of this year, over 210,000 yuan in back taxes and fines were collected from taxi operations at the Hankou Railway Station and other central locations.

    武汉整顿个体客运税收
    本报讯　武汉市税务部门与客运出租汽车管理部门配合，对个体客运汽车的税收实行源泉控制，加强管理，成效显著。小汽车出租行业年户平均税负由原先的589.92元增加到现在的2104.80元，增长2.57倍。
    近年来，武汉个体客运业税收管理混乱，税款大量流失。从去年9月开始，这个市个体客运出租汽车税收由江岸税务分局和武汉市出租汽车管理处集中管理，重新进行税务登记和纳税申报，健全了发票额使用、违章处理等制度，并加强了查缉工作。仅今年5、6两个月，对汉口火车站等出租汽车集中经营点就补税罚款21万多元。
