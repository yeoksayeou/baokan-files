To encourage farmers to support education, education must serve the farmers. The Shanxi Province city of Changzhi has adopted this principle, reforming rural secondary education by implementing the "3+1" education model, thereby promoting education and prosperity.

The "3+1" education model involves students receiving three years of general education followed by one year of vocational and technical training.

Located in the Taihang Mountains, Changzhi has historically lagged in rural education. In 1984, various levels of government in Changzhi mobilized farmers to invest in education. However, because education was severely disconnected from rural realities, many graduates lacked practical skills.

How to bridge the gap for rural students? Changzhi County's Dabutou Township took the lead in finding a new path. The township established vocational courses in agriculture, animal husbandry, and processing at its township-run middle school. Two years later, 204 graduates returned to their villages and quickly became technical leaders and wealth-creation pioneers in various rural industries.

The Changzhi education department promptly summarized the experience of Dabutou Township, naming it the "3+1" education model, and promoted this teaching method across the city. Local areas continued to innovate, developing new ways to implement the "1" year of vocational training in township factories, at specialized households, and in the fields. The content and duration of the "1" year have also become more diverse. Currently, more than half of the township-run middle schools in the city use the "3+1" model.

According to the Changzhi education department, although the "3+1" education model has only been promoted for two years, it has already trained thousands of junior-level technical personnel for rural areas.

### 初中设技专　兴学又富民  长治推广“3＋1”教育

    初中设技专　兴学又富民
    长治推广“3＋1”教育
    据新华社太原8月15日电（记者张伟）要让农民为办教育出力，就要让教育为农民服务。山西省长治市本着这一思想，改革农村中等教育结构，实行“3＋1”教育，既兴了学又富了民。
    “3＋1”教育，即初中学生在学习3年的基础上，再加1年的专业技术教育。
    位于太行山区的长治市，过去农村教育一直比较落后。1984年，长治市各级政府发动农民集资办学。但由于教育严重脱离农村实际，许多学生毕业后无一技之长。
    如何为农家子弟长才干搭起桥梁？长子县大堡头乡率先走出了一条新路。这个乡在乡办中学开设了种、养、加工专业技术课，两年后204名毕业生回到村里，很快成了农村各业的技术和致富带头人。
    长治市教育部门及时总结了大堡头乡的经验，取名为“3＋1”教育，并向全市推广这种教学方式。各地又不断总结，发展了把“1”办到乡镇工厂，办到专业户家里、地里等新的办学方式；“1”的内容、时间也更加多样化。目前，全市有一半以上的乡办中学采用了“3＋1”模式教学。
    据长治市教育部门介绍，“3＋1”教育虽然推广只有两年，但已为农村培养了数千名初级技术人员。
