Lin Xiuqing, a representative of the South Korean National University Student Council, announced on August 1 at the "Unity Pavilion" on the northern side of Panmunjom that she would end her six-day hunger strike and decided to return to her hometown in the South via Panmunjom on August 15, the 44th anniversary of Korea's liberation.

In her statement, Lin Xiuqing said that although the hunger strike had ended, it did not mean the end of the struggle. She stated that the hunger strike had achieved great victories, demonstrating the desire of the 1 million students of the "National Student Council" to build a bridge of unified will on the military demarcation line.

Yesterday, Lin Xiuqing also wrote a letter to Kim Sang-gyu, the president of the South Korean Red Cross, expressing her intention to return to South Korea via Panmunjom to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. She hoped that Kim Sang-gyu could assist her in safely passing through Panmunjom.

Lin Xiuqing began her hunger strike on July 27 after failing to return to her hometown through Panmunjom as she had wished. Members of the International Peace March who participated in the hunger strike with Lin Xiuqing also ended their strike on the same day and issued a statement, calling on people around the world to support Lin Xiuqing's struggle to return to South Korea through the military demarcation line.

    林秀卿停止绝食
    决心15日经板门店回南方
    本报平壤8月2日电　记者徐宝康报道：南朝鲜全国大学生代表协议会代表林秀卿1日在板门店北方一侧的“统一阁”发表声明，宣布停止6天的绝食，并决心在8月15日朝鲜光复44周年之际，经板门店返回故乡南方。
    林秀卿在声明中说，虽然绝食斗争停止了，但这不意味着斗争的结束。她说，绝食斗争取得了巨大胜利，显示了“全大协”100万大学生希望在军事分界线上，建立一条通往统一意志的桥梁。
    林秀卿昨天还写信给南朝鲜红十字会总裁金相浃，表示她拟经板门店回南朝鲜是为了促进祖国和平统一。她希望金相浃能协助她安全通过板门店。
    林秀卿是7月27日在她未能如愿以偿地通过板门店返回故乡后，宣布进行绝食的。随同林秀卿一起参加绝食斗争的国际和平大行军部分成员同一天也停止绝食，并发表声明，呼吁世界各国支持林秀卿通过军事分界线，返回南朝鲜的斗争。
