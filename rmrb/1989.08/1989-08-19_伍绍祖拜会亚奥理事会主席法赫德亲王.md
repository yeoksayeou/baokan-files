Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 19th.

Wu Shaozu, Director of the State Sports Commission and Executive Chairman of the 11th Asian Games Organizing Committee, paid a visit to Prince Fahd Al-Sabah, President of the Olympic Council of Asia, at the Beijing Shangri-La Hotel this afternoon.

During the meeting, Fahd said that through his interactions with various Chinese officials over the past two days, he has gained a deeper appreciation for the ability of China's leaders and people to successfully host the Asian Games. Wu Shaozu stated, "After quelling the unrest, we have unified our thoughts and clarified our tasks. Especially with the support of the Olympic Council of Asia, led by you, we are greatly encouraged. This is a favorable guarantee for successfully hosting the Asian Games. As the Chinese saying goes, 'True friendship is revealed in times of adversity.'"

Wu Shaozu added, "Hosting a successful Asian Games is not just our sincere wish, but something we are definitely capable of achieving. Firstly, we have friends like you. So far, we have not received any news from the members of the Olympic Council of Asia that they will not participate in the Asian Games. Secondly, we have the strong support of the Party, the government, and the people of the entire nation. Therefore, with the joint efforts of all parties, we are fully confident and capable of successfully hosting the Asian Games."

Fahd expressed agreement, saying, "Hosting the Asian Games in China is not only a decision by the Olympic Council of Asia, but also the wish of all young people in Asia. Therefore, any force or organization that opposes the holding of the Asian Games in Beijing is not only opposing China but also going against the will of the Asian people."

Wu Shaozu hoped that the Prince would thoroughly inspect the Asian Games projects and other preparations during his stay in Beijing. Fahd said, "True friends should be candid with each other. This morning, he had already raised some questions about the preparations with Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa."

    伍绍祖拜会亚奥理事会主席法赫德亲王
    本报北京8月19日讯　记者李北大报道：国家体委主任、第11届亚运会组委会执行主席伍绍祖今天下午前往北京香格里拉饭店，拜会了亚奥理事会主席谢·法赫德亲王。
    会见时法赫德说，通过两天来与中国各方面官员的接触，更加感到中国的领导人和中国人民能够办好亚运会。伍绍祖说：“我们在平息暴乱后统一了思想，明确了任务。特别是得到以您为首的亚奥理事会支持，对我们鼓舞很大，这是办好亚运会的有利保证，用中国话说就是‘患难见真情’。”
    伍绍祖说：“开好亚运会不单是我们的良好愿望，而且是一定能实现的。首先，我们有像您这样的朋友，到目前为止尚未接到亚奥理事会所属成员不参加亚运会的消息。其次，我们得到了党和政府，以及全国人民的大力支持。因此，在各方面共同努力下，我们完全有信心有能力开好亚运会。”
    法赫德对此表示赞同，他说，由中国承办亚运会不仅是亚奥理事会的决定，同时也是亚洲所有青年人的心愿，所以任何一种势力、一种组织反对在北京举办亚运会，也就不仅是反对中国，也是违背亚洲人民的意愿。
    伍绍祖希望亲王在北京逗留期间详细查看亚运会工程以及其它筹备情况。法赫德说，真朋友应该坦诚相见，今天上午他已向张百发副市长提出筹备工作的一些问题。
