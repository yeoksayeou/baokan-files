	The nationally renowned poverty-stricken area of Bijie in Guizhou has embarked on a path of synchronizing poverty alleviation with ecological construction, striving for new breakthroughs.

	Bijie has summarized historical experiences and recognized that to break the vicious cycle of poverty, ecology, and population, it is necessary to focus on development. Without development, there is no accumulation or investment, making it impossible to solve the problem of basic sustenance, improve the ecological environment, or address the issue of raising the population's quality. Based on the summary of historical experiences, the regional committee and administrative office proposed a comprehensive treatment report for the entire region. In 1988, Bijie was designated by the state as an "Experimental Zone for Poverty Alleviation and Ecological Construction." After the establishment of the experimental zone, a series of intensive efforts were launched: First, strive for the "Five Achievements," namely, planting fast-growing trees on mountain tops (wearing hats), planting economic trees on mountain slopes (tying belts), covering slopes with green manure and tea leaves (spreading carpets), developing various industries and township enterprises at the foot of the mountains (making money), and planting grains in the fields (growing rice). Second, focus on industry. Initially, projects that cover a wide area and drive thousands of households out of poverty and into prosperity were prioritized. Bijie is one of the national bases for high-quality tobacco, so the production capacity of re-drying factories and cigarette factories was expanded, driving the development of tobacco production, making the tobacco leaf series a major economic pillar in the area; established wool spinning, leather, and a number of food processing enterprises, stimulating the development of animal husbandry; established key industries with good economic benefits, supporting and driving the development of township enterprises, of which 98% are household and joint household enterprises. This enabled hundreds of thousands of farmers to quickly transition from limited arable land. Third, send more than 5,000 cadres to the countryside to help villages and households formulate ecological construction and commodity economic development plans, improve land contract management; establish a number of forest, fruit, medicinal, and tea bases, and carry out the construction of economic forests, fruit forests, fast-growing forests, and tea "three forests and one tea" projects; strictly control population growth, keeping the natural population growth rate within the planned requirements; decentralize personnel and financial powers to the districts and counties, and through the implementation of remuneration and other measures, restore the operation of village and group organizations, and connect the "heaven and earth line."

	Through arduous efforts, the experimental zone has shown initial results. Last year, more than 500,000 rural residents in the region escaped poverty, and fiscal revenue increased by 100 million yuan. The long-standing vicious cycle of poverty, ecology, and population has begun to ease, and a new turning point has emerged.

    开发扶贫与生态建设同步
    毕节试验区治穷脱贫闯新路
    全国有名的贫困地带——贵州毕节地区，开发扶贫与生态建设同步进行，勇闯新路。
    毕节地区通过总结历史经验，认识到要摆脱贫困、生态、人口三者的恶性循环，必须从抓开发入手。不抓开发，没有积累和投入，解决不了温饱，改善不了生态环境，也解决不了提高人口素质的问题。地委、行署在总结历史经验的基础上，提出全地区的综合治理报告。1988年毕节被国家定为“开发扶贫、生态建设试验区”。试验区建成后，展开了一系列的紧张工作：一、力争“五子登科”，即山顶戴帽子（种速生林）、山腰拴带子（种经济林木）、坡地铺毯子（种绿肥和茶叶）、山脚抓票子（发展多种经营和乡镇企业）、田里种谷子（抓粮食）。二、认真抓工业。首先抓覆盖面广、带动千家万户脱贫致富的项目。毕节是全国优质烟基地之一，于是便扩大复烤厂、卷烟厂生产能力，带动了烤烟生产的发展，使烟叶系列生产成了当地主要经济支柱；建起毛纺、皮革和一批食品加工企业，刺激了畜牧业发展；建立经济效益好的骨干产业，支持和带动了乡镇企业，而乡镇企业98％是户办和联户办的，这使得几十万农民从有限的耕地上迅速转移出来。三、派5000多干部下乡，帮助乡乡村村和千家万户制订生态建设和商品经济发展规划，完善土地承包管理；建起一批林果药茶基地，开展经济林、果木林、速生林、茶叶“三林一茶”工程建设；严格控制人口增长，将人口自然增长率控制在计划要求内；下放人权财权充实区乡，通过落实报酬等恢复村组班子运转，接通了“天地线”。
    经过艰苦的努力，试验区已初见成效。去年全地区有50多万农村人口脱贫，财政收入净增1个亿，长期困扰人们的贫困、生态、人口恶性循环的局面开始缓解，出现新的转机。
