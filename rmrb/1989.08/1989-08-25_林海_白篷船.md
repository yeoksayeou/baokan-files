Title: White Sailboats in the Forest Sea

In the green waves of the forest sea,
Sail a few white sailboats,
These are the tents of the forest survey team,
Carrying the hopes and expectations of the motherland.

Cutting through the vast expanse of pine waves,
They sail into the "harbors" of rocky cliffs,
In an instant, they drift down to the valley floor filled with fragrant wildflowers,
In a moment, they leap to the mountain peaks shrouded in white clouds!

In the morning,
They are like a few dew-kissed, crystal-clear peonies,
In the evening mist,
They are like a cluster of tender, loving water lilies.

The "white sailboats" light their "fishing fires,"
Wild game under the moonlight;
In the cold wind, the team leader organizes photographs and charts,
The team members, checking their spirit levels and compasses in their hearts.

A tune of Shandong drum ballad is so rough and powerful,
A melody of Jiangnan flute is so clear and soft,
Fatigue disappears by the joyful "fishing fire,"
Dreaming of a green spring, lulled by the pine waves!

    林海“白篷船”
　　张育瑄
    在绿波荡漾的林海里，
    “航行”着几艘白色的篷船，
    那是森林调查队员的帐篷，
    把祖国的希望和期待载满。
    劈开万顷松涛，
    又驶进石崖“港湾”，
    瞬间，飘落在野花芬芳的谷底，
    须臾，又跃上白云缭绕的山巅！
    清晨，
    似几朵露珠晶营的牡丹，
    暮霭中，
    又像一簇含情脉脉的睡莲。
    “白篷船”升起了“渔火”，
    野味就着月光；
    寒风中，队长整理照片和图表，
    队员们，校着心中的水平仪和罗盘。
    一曲山东梆子何等粗犷宏亮，
    一腔江南的笛声何等清脆婉转，
    疲劳，消逝在这欢乐的“渔火”旁，
    枕着松涛，睡梦里憧憬着绿色的春天！
