Comrade Fu Zhong, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal and steadfast communist warrior tested by time, a revolutionary of the proletariat, an outstanding political work leader of our army, former member of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China, former Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and former Vice Chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, passed away at 1:40 AM on July 28, 1989, in Beijing, due to long-term illness and ineffective treatment. He was 89 years old.

Comrade Fu Zhong was born on June 28, 1900, in the city of Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, into a scholarly family. In his youth, he loved his country, studied diligently, admired progressive reformers, and championed democratic, scientific, and new cultural thoughts. Influenced by the May Fourth Movement, he actively participated in student movements against imperialism and feudal warlords. In the winter of 1920, to learn skills for national salvation, he, along with Zhou Enlai and others, traveled to France to study and work. In France, he worked in a steel factory while studying Marxism and participating in propaganda and education work for Chinese workers organized by Zhao Shiyan and others. In the winter of 1921, he established contact with the Paris Communist Youth Group and later participated in the establishment of the Communist Youth Party of China in Europe, becoming a member of the Communist Party of China. In 1922, he led the establishment of the "Book and Newspaper Mobile Reading Society" at the Brive School in France to propagate revolutionary ideas. In 1923, he transferred to a rubber factory to continue his work and participated in the "Communist Research Correspondence" activities and the struggle against anarchist and nationalist thoughts. In 1925, he served as the Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party in Europe and organized and led meetings of Chinese in France to support the May 30th Movement in China. In early 1926, he left Paris and went to Moscow's Sun Yat-sen University to study, also serving as the Deputy Secretary of the Student Branch. In 1927, he transferred to the Lenin Military-Political Academy in Leningrad and graduated at the end of 1929. During his time in the Soviet Union, he attended the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and participated in the work of the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Fu Zhong returned to Shanghai in the spring of 1930 and worked in the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China on cadre and military supply work. He also participated in the translation of Soviet Red Army regulations and statutes. In the summer of 1931, he was sent to the E-Yu-Huai Soviet area, serving as the Secretary of the Political Department of the Fourth Red Army, Political Commissar of the Twelfth Red Brigade, Director and Political Commissar of the Red Fourth Army Mobile School, Director of the Political Department of the Peng-Yang Military and Political Cadres School, and Director of the Political Department of the Tenth Red Army, among other positions. In the arduous and tense environment of the anti-encirclement campaigns, he compiled documents and teaching materials such as "Red Army Handbook" and "Platoon Commander's Handbook," and personally taught courses, training a large number of cadres and grassroots leaders for the troops. In the winter of 1932, he entered Sichuan with the Fourth Red Army to help establish the Sichuan-Shanxi Soviet area, serving as the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Fourth Red Army (later also the Northwest Military Region) and simultaneously editing newspapers and magazines such as "Red Army News" and "Essential Reading for Cadres." In the battles against the enemy's "three-pronged attack," "six-pronged attack," and the Yinan, Yingqu, and Xuanda campaigns, he did a great deal of ideological and organizational work to cultivate the troops' good combat style, ensure victory in battles, expand the Soviet area, and develop the Red Army. The documents he drafted, such as the "Temporary Detailed Work Regulations for the Political Departments of the Army and Brigade," "Temporary Detailed Work Regulations for the Political Departments of the Regiment," and the "Resolution on Political and Party Work of the Fourth Red Army," played an important role in improving the political quality of the troops and strengthening the construction of political organs.

Comrade Fu Zhong participated in the Long March with the Fourth Red Army. In the spring of 1935, during the Guangzhao Campaign and the Southern Shaanxi Campaign to support the Central Red Army's northward advance and the entry of the Twenty-Fifth Red Army into Shaanxi, as well as the long-distance battles of crossing the Jialing River and advancing into northwestern Sichuan, he actively carried out political work and participated in the leadership of logistics support and local work to mobilize the masses. After the First and Fourth Red Armies met, he did a lot of beneficial work to strengthen the unity and friendship between the two armies. In November of the same year, he served as the Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Sichuan-Kang Border Province Committee, leading the opening of new Soviet areas in counties such as Tianquan, Lushan, and Baoxing. In July 1936, after the Second and Fourth Red Armies met in Ganzi, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China established the Northwest Bureau, and he served as the Director of the Organization Department, actively carrying out ideological and political work among cadres to maintain the unity and solidarity of the Party, and assisting comrades such as Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Liu Bocheng, and Xu Xiangqian in thwarting Zhang Guotao's splitist plots. After arriving in Shaanbei, he successively served as the Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Red Army University and the Political Department of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and in late March 1937, he attended the enlarged meeting of the Politburo, actively participating in the struggle to expose and criticize Zhang Guotao's serious errors.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Comrade Fu Zhong attended the famous Luochuan Conference. After the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army, he successively served as the Director of the Mass Work Department of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army, and Director of the Field Political Department of the Eighth Route Army, working tirelessly to mobilize the masses, expand the united front, strengthen the people's army, carry out guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear, and establish anti-Japanese democratic bases. From 1938 to 1940, he drafted documents such as the "Political Reorganization Plan for the Eighth Route Army Headquarters" and the "Political Reorganization Order," which played an important role in the army's adherence to the Party's leadership and strengthening political work. He paid great attention to studying new problems in military political work in the context of the anti-Japanese national united front, and to summarizing new experiences in political work in the army under harsh, dispersed, and prolonged combat conditions. His articles, such as "Experience in Political Work of the Eighth Route Army in the War of Resistance" and "On the Problem of Revolutionary Army Building," timely guided the army's political work. Starting in 1941, he served as the Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission, and in 1943, he concurrently served as the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Shan-Gan-Ning-Jin-Sui Border Region Army. In 1945, he attended the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China as a formal representative and delivered a speech titled "Strengthening Party Unity and Opposing Factionalism," summarizing historical experiences and lessons, and was praised by comrades such as Mao Zedong at the meeting.

In early 1946, Comrade Fu Zhong, as part of the Communist Party of China delegation led by Zhou Enlai, went to Chongqing, serving as the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Editor-in-Chief of the Xinhua Daily. He actively implemented the Communist Party of China's policy of striving for peace, democracy, unity, and national reunification, writing editorials and articles to propagate the Party's democratic revolutionary program and the achievements of the military and people in the liberated areas during the eight years of resistance against Japan, and criticizing the Kuomintang government's betrayal of the "Double Ten Agreement," the ceasefire agreement, and the Political Consultative Conference. After the Kuomintang launched a full-scale civil war, he returned to Yan'an as ordered and continued to serve as the Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission. Due to the original staff of the General Political Department being transferred to various battlefields in the liberated areas, he was responsible for rebuilding a streamlined General Political Department, participating in the leadership of the General Political Department's work during the War of Liberation under the direction of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission and the Director of the General Political Department. During this period, he participated in the drafting of important regulatory documents such as the "Draft Regulations for the Party Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," "Regulations for Branch Work," and "Regulations for the Revolutionary Soldiers' Committee." These important regulatory documents played an important role in strengthening the Party's unified leadership of the army, improving the Party committee system of our army, strengthening grassroots political work, and ensuring the completion of combat missions. In the spring of 1948, he wrote the "Initial Summary of the New-style Army Reorganization" for the General Political Department. Subsequently, he assisted Comrade Liu Shaoqi in convening the entire army's enemy work conference, making important deployments for our army's political offensive and the disintegration of the Kuomintang army in the strategic offensive stage. In July 1949, he attended the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers as instructed by Comrade Zhou Enlai and delivered an important report on "Work in the Army's Literary and Art Circles."

After the founding of New China, Comrade Fu Zhong long served as the Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, maintaining the Party's leadership of the army, inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions of our army's political work, and making contributions to the revolutionary, modern, and regular construction of our army. In his management of theoretical education and literary and art work, he emphasized the study of Marxist basic theories, the importance of theory linking with practice, understanding the spirit and essence of Marxism, and opposing the practice of taking things out of context. He proposed that the army's literary and art work is an important part of the army's political work, advocating that literature and art serve the construction of the army, continuously improving the ideological and artistic level of literary and art creation, and playing the role of literature and art in uniting the people and inspiring the army's fighting spirit. He often went deep into various literary and art units of the army to guide work and was deeply loved by the broad masses of literary and art workers. During the "Cultural Revolution," he was falsely accused of being a "black line figure" by the Lin Biao counter-revolutionary clique and was persecuted. After the Gang of Four was smashed, he wholeheartedly supported the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, actively supporting the rectification of wrong cases, eliminating the influence of "leftist" thoughts, and supporting young cadres taking up leadership positions at various levels. As one of the responsible persons of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he cared about the study and unity of the literary and art circles, emphasizing the Party's leadership of literary and art work, carrying forward the fine traditions of revolutionary literature and art, and vigorously promoting socialist literature and art. He also cared deeply about the lives of literary and art workers and did his best to help them. He often remembered his early friends and classmates in Taiwan, France, and the Soviet Union, and repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with them to contribute to the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Comrade Fu Zhong was a representative of the Seventh and Eighth National Congresses of the Communist Party of China, a specially invited representative of the Thirteenth National Congress, and a member and standing member of the Central Advisory Commission elected at the Twelfth National Congress; a member of the First, Second, and Third National Defense Councils; a member of the Standing Committee of the Third and Fifth National People's Congresses; and a Vice Chairman of the Third and Fourth Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In 1955, he was awarded the rank of Senior General and received the First Class August First Medal, the First Class Independence and Freedom Medal, and the First Class Liberation Medal. In 1988, he was awarded the First Class Red Star Merit Honor Medal.

Throughout his long, tortuous, and arduous revolutionary struggle, Comrade Fu Zhong was infinitely loyal to his country, his people, and his Party. He always worked diligently with full political enthusiasm. He was morally upright, did not seek personal gain, did not abuse power, and did not calculate personal gains and losses. He was good at uniting with comrades and non-Party friends to work together. He cared for cadres, cared for the masses, was approachable, strict with himself, and honest and upright. In his later years, while hospitalized for treatment, he always paid attention to the construction of the Party and the army during the reform and opening up, cared about the progress of literary and art work, actively supported the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, and insisted on studying and organizing his old works, publishing the book "Basic Problems of Political Work."

Throughout nearly 70 years of revolutionary career, whether in good times or bad, Comrade Fu Zhong always stood with the Party through thick and thin, loyally and steadfastly. For the liberation of the Chinese people and the cause of socialist construction, he endured hardships and devoted his life, contributing his heart's blood and establishing immortal merits. His life was a revolutionary life, a life of struggle, and a life of service to the people. The passing of Comrade Fu Zhong is a great loss to our Party and our army. We mourn Comrade Fu Zhong and turn our sorrow into strength, learning from his revolutionary spirit, noble character, and excellent style, resolutely implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, striving to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country, and to build our army into a modernized and regular revolutionary army.

Comrade Fu Zhong will be forever remembered!

    傅钟同志，1900年6月28日出生于四川省叙永县城的一户书香门第。青少年时期，他热爱祖国，勤奋读书，仰慕倡导革新的仁人志士，崇尚民主、科学和新文化思想。在“五四”运动影响下，他积极参加反对帝国主义和封建军阀的学生运动。1920年冬，为了学习救国救民的本领，他同周恩来等一起，远渡重洋，赴法国勤工俭学。到法国后，一面在钢铁厂做工，一面学习马克思主义，参加由赵世炎等组织的对华工的宣传教育工作。1921年冬，与巴黎共产主义小组取得联系，随后参加筹建旅欧少年中国共产党的活动，成为中国共产党党员。1922年，他在法国布里佛中学领导成立“书报流动阅览社”，宣传革命思想。1923年转到一家橡胶厂当工人，继续参加了“共产主义研究通信”活动以及同无政府主义思想和国家主义派进行的斗争。1925年，他任中共旅欧总支部书记，曾在巴黎组织领导旅法华人集会，声援国内“五卅”运动。1926年初离开巴黎，到苏联莫斯科中山大学学习，并担任学生总支部局副书记。1927年转入列宁格勒托尔马乔夫军事政治学院学习，1929年底毕业。他在留苏期间，曾列席联共（布）第十五次代表大会，参加共产国际执委扩大会的工作。
    第二次国内革命战争期间，傅钟同志于1930年春回国到上海，在中共中央军委机关从事干部工作和兵运工作。他还参加了翻译苏联红军条令、条例的工作。1931年夏天，他被派到鄂豫皖苏区，先后担任红四方面军政治部秘书长，红十二师政委，红四方面军随营学校校长兼政委，彭（湃）杨（殷）军政干部学校政治部主任兼红十师政治部主任等职。在反“围剿”作战的艰苦紧张的环境中，他编写了《红军须知》、《连队指导员手册》等文件、教材，并亲自授课，为部队培养了大批骨干和基层干部。1932年冬，随红四方面军入川，参加创建川陕苏区，任红四方面军（后兼西北军区）政治部副主任，同时主编《红军报》、《干部必读》等报刊。在粉碎敌人的“三路围攻”、“六路围攻”和仪南、营渠、宣达等战役中，他为培养部队良好的战斗作风，保证作战胜利，扩大苏区和发展红军，做了大量的思想工作和组织工作。他主持起草的《军、师政治部暂行工作细则》、《团政治处暂行工作细则》和《红四方面军政治与党务工作决议》等文件，对提高部队政治素质，加强政治机关建设起了重要作用。
