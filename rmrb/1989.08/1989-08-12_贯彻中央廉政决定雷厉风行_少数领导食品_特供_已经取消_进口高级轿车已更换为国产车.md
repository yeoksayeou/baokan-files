According to the decision by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council to address several issues of concern to the public in the near term, the Beijing Municipal Food Supply Bureau has discontinued the special food supply for certain leaders starting from August. Relevant departments under the State Council have also begun replacing imported luxury cars used by leaders of the Central Committee and the State Council with domestically produced cars.

It is reported that the Beijing Municipal Food Supply Bureau was established in the 1950s and operates as an independent, self-financing commercial enterprise. Its primary tasks include ensuring food supply for major national events, foreign hotels and restaurants, foreign experts and students, foreign embassies in China, and organizing and supplying goods uniformly. It also handles the food supply for a small number of leaders, which accounts for about 1% of the bureau's annual sales revenue. The food supplied by this bureau is priced according to the market price set by the Beijing Municipal Price Bureau or higher tourist prices. Previously, the Beijing Municipal Food Supply Bureau supplied grain and oil to certain leaders based on ration coupons at market prices, with an additional 1.5 kilograms of subsidized cooking oil per household per month. Meat, sugar, and eggs were supplied without quantity limits at the prices set for Beijing residents, with pork, beef, and mutton priced about 10% higher than market prices due to quality. After the discontinuation of the special supply, the additional 1.5 kilograms of subsidized cooking oil per household per month has been canceled, and meat, sugar, and eggs are now supplied according to the ration standards for Beijing residents.

According to the decision by the Central Committee and the State Council, the imported luxury cars used by members of the Politburo, the Secretariat, and members of the State Council Standing Committee have been gradually replaced with domestically produced cars. The relevant departments believe that the leaders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council setting an example by not using imported luxury cars will help curb the recent trend of competing for high-end cars, promote the Party's fine traditions, and have a positive impact on the development of China's automotive industry.

It is reported that some other leaders have also requested to replace their cars according to the decision by the Central Committee and the State Council. The relevant departments propose that, given the significant funds required for car replacements and the limited availability of replacement cars, these leaders should continue using their current imported cars for as long as possible. Replacements should only be made when the cars meet the conditions for scrapping and renewal to avoid new waste.

    贯彻中央廉政决定雷厉风行
    少数领导食品“特供”已经取消
    进口高级轿车已更换为国产车
    新华社北京8月12日电　根据中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定，北京市食品供应处已从8月份起取消了对有关领导同志的食品“特供”；国务院有关主管部门对中共中央、国务院领导同志使用的进口高级轿车也已陆续更换为国产轿车。
    据介绍，北京市食品供应处是50年代成立的，属独立核算、自负盈亏的商业经营企业，其主要任务是做好国家重大活动、涉外宾馆饭店、外国专家和留学生、外国驻华使馆等的食品供应，统一组织货源，统一供应政策，同时也承担了对少数领导同志的食品供应，这部分食品的年销售额占整个供应处年销售总额的1％左右。这个食品供应处所供应的食品均执行北京市物价局确定的市场价或高于市场价的旅游价。过去，北京市食品供应处对少数领导同志所需的粮、油，均凭粮票、油票按市场价格供应，只是每户每月照顾增供1斤半平价食油；肉、食糖、鸡蛋的供应不限量，按北京市居民定量供应的牌价供应，其中猪、牛、羊肉等实行优质优价，一般高于市场价的10％。取消“特供”后，原对领导同志每户每月照顾增供的1斤半平价食油已经取消，同时，肉、食糖、鸡蛋均按北京市居民的定量标准限量供应。
    根据中共中央、国务院的决定，中央政治局委员、书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员使用的进口高级轿车已经陆续更换为国产轿车。有关主管部门认为，党中央、国务院领导同志带头不坐进口高级轿车，对于制止近几年来互相攀比争相乘坐高级轿车的奢侈风气，发扬党的优良作风，以及对于促进我国汽车工业的发展，必将产生良好的影响。
    据反映，目前其他一些领导同志也要求按照中共中央、国务院的决定更换轿车。有关主管部门提出，由于更换轿车需要不少资金，而当前能够替换的轿车又有限，因此希望这些领导同志现在使用的进口轿车，尽可能继续使用，待符合报废更新条件时再行更换，以免造成新的浪费。
