At today's meeting of the United Nations Subcommittee on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Chinese observer Yu Zhizhong clearly pointed out that suppressing the riots is China's internal affair, and no country or international organization has the right or reason to interfere.

In the past two days, at the meetings of the United Nations Subcommittee on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, some representatives from Western countries and non-governmental organizations, under the guise of "protecting human rights," have wantonly attacked China's actions to suppress the riots.

Yu Zhizhong pointed out that during the turmoil, those who plotted, incited, and launched the turmoil and riots, as well as the rioters who engaged in beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing, disregarded the constitution and laws. Their actions have nothing to do with protecting human rights.

He said: "Our government's suppression of the turmoil, the quelling of the riots, and the legal punishment of a small number of criminals who severely disrupted social order, engaged in beating, smashing, looting, burning, killing, and attempted to overthrow the constitutional government, is precisely to safeguard the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the vast majority of the people. This is something that any sovereign state should do."

He specifically refuted the so-called lies that the military killed hundreds or even thousands of students in Tiananmen Square and that tanks ran over people. He said that during the process of students withdrawing from the square, the troops did not kill a single person, nor did they run over anyone with military vehicles. The claim that Tiananmen Square was awash with blood is a groundless fabrication.

Yu Zhizhong reiterated that the Chinese government attaches great importance to human rights and has always supported and will continue to support the United Nations' various efforts to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.

According to Thai official sources, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Chunhan said tonight: "Thailand has always had close relations with China. China's suppression of the turmoil in early June is China's internal affair, and Thailand has no intention of interfering."

Chatichai made these remarks when receiving a delegation from the Thai House of Representatives' Military Committee that is about to visit China.

He also said: "In solving the Cambodian problem, Thailand's policy is consistent with China's, that is, recognizing only the four-party coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk."

Xinhua News Agency, Bogota, August 18th

Jose Maria Gomez, who is about to take up his post as Colombia's ambassador to China, said on August 18th in Bogota that the Colombian government supports the stance taken by China in recently suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots.

Gomez made these remarks at a reception held by the Chinese Embassy in Colombia for Colombian students who are about to go to China for study.

He believes that the recent events in Beijing are purely China's internal affairs, and other countries have no right to interfere.

    我观察员在联合国一小组委员会会议上
    驳斥对中国平暴的攻击
    泰国和哥伦比亚支持我平暴立场
    新华社日内瓦8月18日电　在今天举行的联合国防止歧视及保护少数小组委员会会议上，中国观察员俞志忠明确指出，平息暴乱是中国内政，任何国家和国际组织均无权也无理由进行干涉。
    最近两天，在联合国防止歧视及保护少数小组委员会举行的会议上，一些西方国家和非政府组织的代表打着所谓“保护人权”的旗帜，肆意攻击中国平息暴乱的行动。
    俞志忠指出，在动乱中，那些阴谋策划、煽动和发动动乱与暴乱的人以及搞打、砸、抢、烧、杀的暴乱分子置宪法与法律于不顾，他们的所作所为与保护人权毫不相关。
    他说：“我国政府制止动乱、平息暴乱并依法惩处极少数严重破坏社会秩序、搞打、砸、抢、烧、杀和企图推翻宪法政府的犯罪分子，正是为了保障广大人民的人权和基本自由。这是任何一个主权国家理应做的事。”
    他特别驳斥了所谓军队在天安门广场打死几百甚至几千名学生、坦克压死人等谎言。他说，在学生撤离广场的过程中，部队没有打死一个人，也没有用军车轧伤一个人，所谓天安门广场血流成河是毫无根据的捏造。
    俞志忠重申，中国政府是重视人权的，并且一贯而且将继续支持联合国各种促进人权和基本自由的努力。
    新华社曼谷8月18日电　（记者马胜荣）据泰国官方透露，泰国总理差猜·春哈旺今天晚上说：“泰国同中国关系一直很密切。中国6月初平息动乱事件是中国的内政，泰国无意干预。”
    差猜总理是在接见一个即将访问中国的泰国下议院军事委员会代表团时说这番话的。
    他还说：“在解决柬埔寨问题方面，泰国同中国的政策是一致的，即只承认以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。”
    新华社波哥大8月18日电　即将上任的哥伦比亚驻中国大使何塞·玛丽亚·戈麦斯18日在波哥大指出，哥伦比亚政府支持中国最近平息反革命暴乱所采取的立场。
    戈麦斯是在出席中国驻哥伦比亚大使馆为即将前往中国学习的哥伦比亚留学生举行的招待会上讲这番话的。
    他认为，北京最近发生的事件纯属中国内部事务，其它国家无权干涉。
