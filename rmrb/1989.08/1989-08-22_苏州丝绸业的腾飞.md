If Suzhou is a city of paradise, then Suzhou silk is the colorful clouds in that paradise. If the 40 years since liberation have seen the silk industry of Suzhou take a path of vibrant colors, then the past 10 years of reform and opening up have been a golden road to prosperity. In these 10 years, the various types of silk produced in Suzhou could wrap around the Earth 45 times, adding much beauty to our planet!

The traditional silk industry of Suzhou has a history of 3,000 years, with a heyday of "half the city in the northeast, the sound of looms in ten thousand households." However, under the corrupt rule of the old China, although silk industrialists struggled to keep the industry alive, by the eve of liberation, the silk industry of Suzhou was on the brink of collapse. Socialism brought new life to Suzhou's silk industry. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Party, the workers of Suzhou's silk industry have worked tirelessly with a sense of ownership, bringing about tremendous changes in the industry. Especially with the policy of opening up to the outside world, a window to the world has been opened. To ensure that Suzhou's silk industry both inherits and develops its traditional characteristics while aiming for international advanced standards, relevant departments at the provincial and municipal levels have formulated a 10-year technological renovation plan for Suzhou's silk industry. Over the past 10 years, 294 technological renovation projects have been carried out, with an investment of 485 million yuan. Advanced equipment and technology from around the world have been gathered in Suzhou, making many old workers in the silk industry emotional, saying, "We never imagined that Suzhou's silk industry would be like this today!" Some foreign visitors, after touring the silk enterprises in Suzhou and Wuxian, exclaimed, "The hope of the world's silk industry is in China!"

Today, Suzhou's silk industry, from reeling, weaving, dyeing and finishing, clothing, machinery and equipment manufacturing, design samples to scientific research and education, has formed a relatively complete system. The production and export volume of silk have both increased by one fold compared to 10 years ago, making Suzhou the leader in the country. Suzhou silk is popular in more than 100 countries and regions. In 1981, Prince Charles of the United Kingdom specified the purchase of Suzhou silk for his wedding attire; the former First Lady of the United States, Nancy Reagan, also sent someone to Suzhou to buy silk to make luxurious gowns; many Arab merchants came to Suzhou and, seeing the dazzling silk, felt as if they had entered a fairy tale, praising Suzhou silk as "the fairy in the heavenly palace." Currently, Suzhou produces more than 10 major categories of silk products, including satin, gauze, silk, damask, crepe, brocade, chiffon, velvet, hemp, and raw silk, with more than 160 varieties and 3,000 patterns, making it the most comprehensive silk production base in the country. Over the past 10 years, the industry has won 7 gold quality awards and 10 silver quality awards from the state, and more than 100 department and provincial excellent awards.

The silk industry of Suzhou is striding confidently into the 1990s and the 21st century!

    苏州丝绸业的腾飞
    如果说苏州是天堂城市，苏州丝绸就是天堂里的彩霞；如果说解放40年来苏州丝绸工业走了一条七彩之路，那改革开放10年则是一条金子铺成的康庄大道。10年里苏州生产的各类丝绸可绕地球45圈，给地球平添了几多春色！
    传统的苏州丝绸已有3000年的历史，曾有过“东北半城、万户机声”的盛况。但在旧中国的腐败统治下，丝绸实业家们虽然苦力支撑，至解放前夕，苏州丝绸业已处于奄奄一息的境地。社会主义使苏州丝绸业枯木逢春。40年来，苏州丝绸职工在党的领导下，以主人翁的姿态艰苦奋斗，使苏州丝绸业发生了巨大的变化。特别是对外开放政策，打开了瞭望世界的窗口，为了使苏州丝绸业既继承发扬传统特色，又瞄准国际先进水平，省市有关部门制定了苏州丝绸业10年技术改造规划。10年来，共进行了294项技改项目，投资4.85亿元，世界先进的装备、技术，荟萃于苏州，使许多丝绸业的老职工心潮难平，说：“没有想到我们苏州丝绸业会有今天！”有的外宾参观了苏州和吴江的丝绸企业后惊叹：“世界丝绸业的希望还是在中国！”
    现在的苏州丝绸业，从缫丝、织造、染整、服装、机械及器材制造、设计试样到科研教育，已形成比较完整的体系，丝绸产量和出口量都比10年前增加了一倍，已跃居全国之首。苏州丝绸风靡一百多个国家和地区，1981年英国查尔斯王子举行婚礼，指定订购苏州丝绸作为婚礼服；美国前总统里根夫人也慕名请人到苏州购买丝绸制作豪华礼服；许多阿拉伯商人来到苏州，看到绚丽夺目的丝绸，恍如进入童话世界，称誉苏州丝绸是“神宫中的仙女”。目前，苏州全市生产的丝绸产品有绫、罗、绸、缎、纺、绉、锦、绡、纱、绒、葛、绢等10多个大类，160多个品种，3000种花样，成为全国丝绸品种最多最全的生产基地，10年来，全行业共获国家质量金质奖7块，银质奖10块，部、省优奖100多个。
    苏州丝绸业，正意气风发地迈向90年代，迈向21世纪！
