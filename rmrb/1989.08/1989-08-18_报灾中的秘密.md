	Secrets in Disaster Reporting

	This year, several places have experienced floods. Once a disaster occurs, reporting and relief efforts become the necessary work of the Party and the government.

	However, in disaster reporting, there are often abnormal phenomena: minor disasters are reported as major ones, and major disasters are reported as catastrophic ones, with the disaster situation being arbitrarily exaggerated. In a certain township in Jiangnan, a flood disaster destroyed more than 10 houses and flooded over 200 acres of farmland, along with other losses. After the township cadres conducted an investigation, they estimated the loss to be 800,000 yuan. Later, a county work team's investigation suggested the loss might be 1.3 million yuan. But the final reported total loss to the county was 3.3 million yuan. This increase was to match the estimate made by the county leaders.

	Disaster situations are objectively existing facts. The loss is what it is, but why can it be inflated by several times? It is simply to use this as an opportunity to ask for more money from higher authorities. This way, it can comfort the disaster victims and help them recover production more quickly; secondly, it can also show that one has the ability to handle the situation. Why not do it? Unfortunately, this throws the national interest to the winds.

	If one says that those who falsely report disaster situations all have such thoughts, it might be an overstatement. Some people falsely report disaster situations out of helplessness. In reporting disasters, they are not unaware of the need to truthfully reflect the situation, nor are they unaware of Party principles and discipline. But when they consider, "For disasters of similar severity, others report more, and higher authorities give more. If I report truthfully, I might get less. If that happens, how can I explain it to the disaster victims?" They then make up their minds: inflate and overreport. This phenomenon not only increases the country's unreasonable expenditures but also fosters an unhealthy trend. Although there have been many stories in Chinese history of people being punished for falsely reporting disasters, today, such stories are still rare.

	The key issue is how to verify disaster situations. Some places do not pay enough attention to verification work, allowing those who falsely report to gain an advantage, or even hinting to subordinates to falsely report. These are likely the root causes of the trend of overreporting. From this perspective, in disaster reporting, it is particularly necessary to emphasize national interests, Party principles, and discipline, and to establish an effective system for verifying disaster situations.

### 报灾中的秘密

    报灾中的秘密
    今年，若干地方闹水灾。既然出现灾情，于是报灾、救灾就是党和政府必然的工作。
    但在报灾中，却往往出现一些不正常现象，就是把轻灾报成重灾，把重灾报成特重灾，随意扩大灾情。江南某乡，遭受了一次洪水灾害，被冲毁民房10多间，冲毁粮田200多亩，还有其它损失。乡干部调查后，估计损失80万元，后经县工作组调查，说可能损失130万元。但最后确定报县总损失数是330万元。这一次加码，是因为要凑合县领导人作出的估计数。
    灾情，原是客观存在的。损失多少就是多少，但为什么能以几倍之数“上浮”呢？无非是借机向上级多要钱。这样一来可以安慰灾民、帮助他们较快地恢复生产；二来也可显示出自己有本领，何乐而不为？只可惜把国家利益抛到九霄云外去了。
    若说虚报灾情者都是这种想法，恐怕也是言过其实。有些人虚报灾情，也是出于无可奈何。他们在报灾中，不是不考虑到要如实反映情况，不是不考虑到党性和纪律，但当他考虑到，“差不多重的灾情，人家多报了，上级就多给，我若如实报了，就可能少给，若这样，我怎能向灾民交待呀！”于是就横下了一条心：加码多报。这种现象，不但增加国家的不合理开支，并且还助长了不正之风。中国历史上虽有过不少因虚报灾情而被惩办的故事，但现今，这类故事毕竟还是罕见少闻。
    关键问题是如何核实灾情。有些地方对核实工作不够重视，让虚报者占了便宜，或者甚至暗示下级虚报，这些恐怕是造成虚报风的根源。如此看来，在报灾中，强调国家利益，强调党性和纪律，并制订出一套有效的核实灾情的工作制度，就显得十分必要了。
