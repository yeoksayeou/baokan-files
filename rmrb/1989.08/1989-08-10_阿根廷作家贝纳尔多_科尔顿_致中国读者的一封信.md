	Argentinean writer Bernardo Kordon's
	Letter to Chinese Readers

	Editor's Note: Bernardo Kordon, an Argentinean writer in his 70s, has been engaged in Sino-Argentinean friendship work since the 1950s. He has visited China eight times and has been received by Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and Vice Premier Chen Yi. Kordon is very familiar with China and has written several books introducing the Chinese revolution and construction. Recently, he wrote a letter to our correspondent in Argentina, expressing his views on the events that took place in Beijing in June this year. His letter is published below:

	What happened in China in June this year? I have visited China eight times and know China. I absolutely cannot believe that the People's Liberation Army would suppress the people instead of serving the people.

	I remember during one of my visits, I met Chairman Mao Zedong. What surprised me was that Chairman Mao asked me if I had visited the units of the People's Liberation Army. I replied, "No." "You don't know our army? You should get to know it. It is a unique army in the world," Mao Zedong said this in the tone of a loving father talking about his own son. The next day, I was to leave for Europe, but I promised that I would follow Chairman Mao's advice on my next visit to China.

	Later, I indeed visited a tank unit in Jinan, Shandong Province. It was snowing heavily. An officer and several soldiers welcomed me in the camp. They were all dressed in the same military uniform. I looked around; the camp was very simple. After the visit, I found that, as Chairman Mao had introduced, it was indeed a unique army. When soldiers enlisted, in addition to receiving their uniforms, they were also given a needle and thread to mend their uniforms. This army helped farmers harvest crops, cleaned courtyards, and grew their own food. In the hotel where I stayed, every night a squad of soldiers came to the dining hall to help wash dishes and kitchen utensils. In short, this is an army trained with Mao Zedong's principle of serving the people. I cannot imagine this army would "suppress the people" as reported by American news agencies.

	Americans always talk about "democracy." When they were carrying out genocide in Vietnam, they also talked about "democracy." Today, they talk about democracy on one hand and support the anti-government forces in Nicaragua on the other, trying to restore the United Fruit Company's plantations in Nicaragua. Whenever we Latin Americans hear the Americans mention the word "democracy," we put our hands on our gun handles, because when the Americans armed invaders into Mexico and Cuba, they also demanded "democracy." The Chinese people should never forget that at the beginning of this century, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China to conquer the Chinese people, and the United States was also part of it. The commander of the Eight-Nation Alliance, German imperialist Marshal von Waldersee, admitted that the Chinese people have limitless vitality, and no European country or Japan has the spiritual and military strength to divide China. These words were written to Kaiser Wilhelm II. It was this emperor who, before sending troops to China, told his soldiers that they were "representing German civilization to fight against Chinese barbarism." Times have changed, and the word "civilization" has been replaced by "democracy." I support the Chinese leaders not bowing to this "democracy" produced by the United States.

	Dear Chinese friends, no one knows better than you the sufferings of the Chinese people before liberation, and no one knows better than you the great changes that have benefited 1 billion Chinese people. The Chinese people live in peace, with three meals a day guaranteed, and decent clothes to wear. People who have been mired in ignorance for centuries have received education and training and have jobs. Workers and farmers can save for the future, the sick receive free medical treatment, and the elderly are respected and can live out their days in dignity. Science, culture, industry, trade, and other fields have achieved brilliant results. But please note, all these achievements are the result of solid, step-by-step efforts. China has made mistakes, this is a fact. People make mistakes everywhere. In China, a country that had been isolated from the world for several centuries and had a long and rigid feudal system, it is impossible to realize the ideals we all yearn for in one night.

### 阿根廷作家贝纳尔多·科尔顿  致中国读者的一封信

专栏：

    阿根廷作家贝纳尔多·科尔顿
    致中国读者的一封信
    编者按：年过7旬的阿根廷作家贝纳尔多·科尔顿，从50年代起就从事阿中友好工作，曾经8次访华，受到毛主席、周总理和陈毅副总理的接见。科尔顿很了解中国，写过几本介绍中国革命和建设情况的书。最近，他写信给本报驻阿根廷记者站，语重心长地向中国人民表达他对今年6月北京发生的事件的看法。现将他的信刊载如下：
    中国今年6月发生了什么事？我曾经8次访问过中国，了解中国。我绝不能相信人民解放军会镇压人民而不是为人民服务。
    记得在一次访问中，我会见了毛泽东主席。使我感到十分意外的是，毛主席问我是否访问过解放军部队。我回答说“没有”。“你不了解我们的军队？应该了解它，这是一支世界上独一无二的军队。”毛泽东说这话的口吻就像慈父在谈论自己的爱子。第二天我就要去欧洲，但我答应下次访华时一定接受毛主席的建议。
    后来我果真在山东济南访问了一支坦克部队。天下着大雪。一位军官和几个战士在营区内迎候我，他们穿着一样的军服。我环顾四周，营区极为简朴。参观以后我发现，正如毛主席介绍的那样，这是一支独一无二的军队。士兵在入伍时，除了领到军装，还发给一根针一绺线，用来缝补军装。这支军队帮助农民收割庄稼，打扫庭院，他们种自己吃的粮食……在我下榻的饭店，每天晚上都有一队士兵来餐厅帮助刷洗盘子、炊具。总之，这是一支用毛泽东的为人民服务的原则培养出来的军队。我不能想象这支军队会像美国新闻机构所说的那样“镇压人民”。
    美国人总在谈论“民主”。当他们在越南进行种族灭绝的屠杀时，谈论的也是“民主”。今天，他们一边侈谈民主，一边资助尼加拉瓜反政府武装，企图恢复联合果品公司在尼加拉瓜的庄园。我们拉丁美洲人一听到美国人念叨“民主”这个词时，就会把手按到腰间的枪把上，因为当年美国武装入侵墨西哥和古巴时，要求的也是“民主”。中国人永远不应忘记，本世纪初8国列强联合入侵中国企图征服中国人民时，美国也是有份的。8国联军总司令、德国帝国主义者瓦德西元帅承认，中国人具有无限的生命力，任何一个欧洲国家以及日本都没有精神的和军事的实力来分割中国。这段话是他写给德皇威廉二世的。正是这位皇帝在发兵前往中国时，对将士们说他们是“代表德国的文明去同中国的野蛮作战的”。时代变了，“文明”一词被“民主”取代。我赞成中国领导人不向这种美国出品的“民主”低头。
    亲爱的中国朋友们，没有人比你们更清楚解放前中国人民遭受的苦难，也没有人比你们更了解使10亿中国人受益的巨大变化。中国人生活安定，人们每日三餐有保证，有像样的衣服穿。多少世纪以来陷于愚昧的人们受到教育和培训，有职业。工人和农民能够为将来储蓄，病人得到免费医疗，老人受到尊敬并能体面地安度晚年。科学、文化、工业、贸易等都取得了辉煌的成就。但是请注意，所有这些成就都是脚踏实地一步一步取得的。中国也犯过错误，这是事实。世界各处都有人犯错误。在中国，这个曾与世界隔绝了几个世纪、有过漫长而僵化的封建制度的国家里，不可能一个晚上就实现我们大家都渴望的理想。
