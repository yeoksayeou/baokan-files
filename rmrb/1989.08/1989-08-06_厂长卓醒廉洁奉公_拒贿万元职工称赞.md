Factory Director Zhao Xing of the Lingui Pharmaceutical Factory in Guangxi has consistently rejected various forms of bribery while leading production and business activities, maintaining integrity and dedication to public service. This has earned him the praise of the workers.

The Lingui Pharmaceutical Factory is located in the scenic Xicheng District of Guilin City. It is a pharmaceutical enterprise that primarily produces traditional Chinese medicines, raw materials, and Western pharmaceutical preparations, while also engaging in the production of health beverages. Over the past few years, there have been frequent instances of drug merchants offering substandard and overpriced raw materials to the factory. Their tactic is to offer "goodwill fees" to achieve their goals, with Zhao Xing often being their primary target. Once, two drug merchants from Zhejiang Province came to the factory to push 3 tons of white atractylodes. Due to the poor quality and high price, Zhao Xing rejected the offer. That night, the two merchants went to Zhao Xing's home, repeatedly asking him to accept the white atractylodes, and forcibly left a paper package before quickly leaving. The next day at work, Zhao Xing handed over the unopened package to the Party Branch Secretary. Upon opening and checking, it was found to contain 400 yuan in cash. Zhao Xing instructed the office to immediately return the money to the two merchants. In April of last year, two drug merchants from Inner Mongolia came to Zhao Xing's home, asking him to purchase 5 tons of fritillary, and promising 8,000 yuan as a kickback. This was also rejected by Zhao Xing. According to incomplete statistics, Zhao Xing has rejected nearly 100,000 yuan in kickbacks over the years, thereby safeguarding the interests of the state and consumers.

Zhao Xing's rejection of corruption has fostered a good factory culture, and the workers have increased their production enthusiasm. Last year, the factory was named an "Advanced Unit in Economic Efficiency" by the Autonomous Region.

    厂长卓醒廉洁奉公  拒贿万元职工称赞
    新华社南宁8月6日电  （记者肖美俊）广西临桂县制药厂厂长卓醒，在领导生产和经营活动中，拒收各种贿赂，廉洁奉公，受到职工们的赞誉。
    临桂制药厂位于风景秀丽的桂林市西城区，是一个生产中成药、原料药和西药制剂为主兼营保健饮品的医药企业。几年来，经常有一些药商拿着质次价高的药材到厂里推销，而采取的手法都是用给“好处费”来企图达到目的，卓醒厂长往往成为他们的主要目标。有一次，浙江省两名药商到厂打算推销3吨白术。因质差价高，被卓醒拒绝了。当天晚上，这两名药商到卓醒家里，一再要求他收下白术，并强行留下一个纸包，迅即离开。第二天上班，卓醒把纸包原封不动地交给党总支书记。经开包检点，里面包着人民币400元。卓醒叫厂部办公室立即把钱退还给两个药商。去年4月，又有两个内蒙古来的药商找到卓醒家里，要求他买下5吨贝母，并许口8000元作为回扣费，同样被卓醒拒绝了。据不完全统计，卓醒几年来拒收回扣费近万元，维护了国家和消费者的利益。
    卓醒厂长拒腐蚀的行为带出了一个良好的厂风，职工们也增添了生产干劲。去年这个厂被评为自治区“经济效益先进单位”。
