    Egypt's agricultural "pyramid" has collapsed!
    Egyptian agricultural experts have sounded the alarm. Today, this country, once known as the "granary of the Nile," is facing a severe food crisis. Due to a significant reduction in arable land, a sharp decline in crop yields, and increasingly tight urban food supplies, 28,000 villages across the country are unable to be self-sufficient in food. The government spends huge amounts of foreign exchange to import large quantities of food from abroad.

    Statistics show that Egypt spent tens of billions of dollars last year to import nearly 6.5 million tons of grain from the United States, Australia, and the European Community. The amount spent on grain imports accounts for 70% of Egypt's total imports! Egypt is now one of the world's leading grain importers.

    Currently, Egypt's self-sufficiency rate for grain is only 21%, while in 1978, this figure was 53%.

    Egypt's grain production has reached self-sufficiency levels in the past. However, since the early 1960s, it has begun to import grain. The average annual grain consumption per person has increased from less than 100 kilograms in the early 1970s to around 180 kilograms today, nearly doubling.

    Egyptian agricultural experts believe that the main reasons for the current agricultural crisis in Egypt are as follows:

    — Due to the long-term implementation of the state's grain procurement and distribution system, farmers are forced to sell grain to the state at designated prices. However, the prices of agricultural production materials have risen sharply, thus dampening farmers' enthusiasm for grain production. Additionally, Egypt's subsidy policy for agricultural products has kept agricultural product prices low, reducing farmers' income.

    — The area of arable land and crop cultivation has not been expanded for a long time and has even decreased. From 1965 to 1985, Egypt's arable land area remained around 13 million feddans (1 feddan is equivalent to 6.3 acres). The wheat cultivation area from 1982 to 1986 did not exceed 1.3 million feddans, while the cotton cultivation area decreased from 1.55 million feddans to about 1.24 million feddans in recent years.

    Egypt's population is growing rapidly. Now, the population increases by 1 million every 10 months, with the current total population nearing 53 million. The natural annual population growth rate is approximately 3%, while the annual grain growth rate is only 2.6%, leading to a decrease in per capita arable land and per capita grain availability.

    — Large numbers of farmers are leaving rural areas to seek livelihoods in cities or to earn foreign exchange in the Gulf and other Arab countries. Therefore, rural labor has significantly decreased, labor costs have risen, leading to increased agricultural production costs. Additionally, farmers' lack of modern agricultural knowledge and management skills also affects agricultural production development.

    To address Egypt's current food shortage, some Egyptian and foreign agricultural experts and scholars have proposed the following suggestions:

    ① Adjust Egypt's agricultural policies, improve the state's grain procurement and distribution and subsidy systems, so that farmers can gain more benefits and increase their enthusiasm.

    ② Adjust the agricultural production structure, increase the proportion of wheat and rice among major crops, and expand the cultivation area of economic crops.

    ③ Develop and improve land, using modern technology to maximize the use of existing arable land. On undeveloped land, develop livestock farming.

    ④ Promote the cultivation of short-growing, high-yield crops, practice reasonable dense planting, and promote the interplanting and rotation of crops.

    ⑤ Take measures to stop the blind influx of rural populations into cities, encourage college graduates to engage in agricultural production. Provide farmers with sufficient agricultural production funds and ample production materials, and conduct cultural and technical training for farmers.

    埃及面临粮食危机
    齐前进
    “埃及农业的金字塔倒塌了！”
    埃及农业专家们敲响了警钟。今天，这个昔日有“尼罗河粮仓”之称的国家面临严重的粮食危机。由于耕地面积大幅度减少，农作物产量急剧下降，城市粮食供应日趋紧张，全国2.8万个村庄粮食不能自给，政府花费巨额外汇从国外进口大量粮食。
    据统计，埃及去年花费几十亿美元从美国、澳大利亚和欧洲共同体国家进口了近650万吨粮食。粮食进口额占埃及总进口额的70％！埃及在世界上主要粮食进口国中已名列前茅。
    埃及目前粮食自给率只有21％，而在1978年，这个比率曾达53％。
    埃及粮食生产曾达到过自给水平。但从60年代初起就开始进口粮食。个人年平均粮食消费量从70年代初不足100公斤上升到现在的180公斤左右，几乎增加一倍。
    埃及农业专家们认为，造成目前埃及农业危机的原因主要有以下几方面：
    ——由于国家长期以来对粮食实行统购统销制度，强迫农民以指定价格把粮食出售给国家，但农业生产资料价格大幅度上升，因此打击了农民生产粮食的积极性。另外，埃及对农产品实行补贴政策也使农产品价格偏低，农民收入减少。
    ——农作物种植面积和耕地面积长期得不到扩大甚至减少。1965年到1985年，埃及耕地面积一直徘徊在1300万费丹（1费丹相当于6.3市亩）。
    小麦种植面积1982年到1986年间不超过130万费丹，而棉花种植面积则从155万费丹减少到近年的124万费丹。
    埃及人口急剧增长。现在，每10个月人口增加100万，目前总人口接近5300万。人口自然年增长率约为3％，而粮食年增长率仅为2.6％，从而导致人均耕地面积减少，人均粮食占有量下降。
    ——农民大批离开农村到城市谋生，或到海湾和其他阿拉伯国家挣取外汇。因此，农村劳动力大量减少，劳动力价格上涨，导致农业生产成本增加。其次，由于农民缺乏现代农业科学知识和管理能力，也影响到农业生产的发展。
    为了解决埃及目前缺粮的状况，一些埃及和外国农业专家和学者提出了以下几点建议：
    ①调整埃及农业政策，改进国家对农产品的统购统销和补贴制度，使农民能够得到更大利益，调动他们的积极性。
    ②调整农业生产结构，增加小麦、稻米在主要农作物中的比重，同时，扩大经济作物种植面积。
    ③开发和改良土地，依靠现代技术尽最大可能利用现有耕地。在未开发的土地上，发展畜牧业。
    ③发展生长期短、产量高的农作物，进行合理密植，推广套种和轮种农作物生产。
    ④采取措施制止农村人口盲目涌入城市，鼓励大学毕业生从事农业生产。给农民提供足够的农业生产资金和充裕的生产资料，并开展对农民的文化技术培训。
