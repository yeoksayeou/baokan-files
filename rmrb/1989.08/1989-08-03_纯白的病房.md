The Pure White Ward
Tian Yajie

The night was deep, and he was still leaning on his crutch, wandering in the hospital corridor. The crutch tapped out a steady rhythm. For some reason, my thoughts were also infected by that short, abrupt rhythm:
Bed 7, male, bone tumor, amputation, left leg, 25 years old...

This rhythmic cutting made one's nerves tense, unbearable.

White angel, what a romantic name. Yet, accompanying the angel is the demon of disease. Healthy bodies are shrouded by the shadow of illness. Disability, old age, worry, moans, death—all force you to feel sympathy, compel you to feel sorrow, and drive you to worry. Facing the misfortune of patients, the angel cannot freely laugh and joke, sing and dance, dress in bright colors, chew gum, or show happiness; facing the unfortunate patients, the angel also cannot frown, hang one's head, remain silent, smile without showing teeth, or be at a loss...

The ward should be purely white, allowing no other colors.

"Don't walk anymore, go back and rest!" I finally couldn't help but say to him. My tone was commanding, to show the authority of a nurse.

"Sorry, nurse. I won't walk tomorrow. Just let me today."

Tomorrow? Surgery! I suddenly realized.

"No more walking, no more walking, no more walking..." He muttered, heart-wrenching. His eyes were filled with tears.

People, how many threads are there that cannot be cut between us, layer upon layer, endless, like a net, like hemp. At this moment, he wanted to walk, needed support. Here, only I could help. Is it responsibility? Duty? Necessity? Of course, one can think of nothing, and then it is nothing. Angels, angels also need to sleep. Tired, just lean on the table and doze off.

But, the repeated pleas, the glistening tears, were enough to change one's heart rhythm.

I put his crutch aside and supported him, walking back and forth in the corridor... For me, this night was long. For him?

The ward remained purely white, along with the passing time.

He was going to be discharged. The nurses came to see him off. With the help of others, he stood on one leg and bowed deeply. Before leaving, he handed me a letter.

The content of the letter made me stunned and confused, my face burning hot, as if I had received a thick gift meant for someone else. I tried hard to recall, all the things I did for him were very ordinary: giving injections, changing dressings, washing his face, bringing him meals, finding a book, delivering a message, and then the night before the surgery. To be honest, at that time, I was very tired and wanted to take a nap.

Just these things, could they make one feel "grateful as a mountain"?

The letter, throughout, repeated only these four words.

    纯白的病房
    田亚杰
    夜深了，他还拄着拐，在病房的走廊里徘徊。拐杖以不变的节奏敲出了声响。不知怎的，我的思绪也被染上了那间续短促的节奏：
    7号床、男、骨瘤、要截肢、左腿、25岁……
    这节奏的切割让人神经紧张，难以忍受。
    白衣天使，多浪漫的称呼。可陪伴天使的是病魔。健康的肌体被疾病的阴翳裹围。病残、衰老、愁容、呻吟、死亡，强制你动心，逼迫你伤感，驱策你劳神。面对着病人的不幸，天使当然不能纵情说笑，不能且歌且舞，不能衣饰花俏，不能口嚼香糖，不能喜形于色；面对着不幸的病人，天使当然也不能愁眉紧锁，不能垂头丧气，不能一言不发，不能一笑不露，不能一筹莫展……
    病房，仿佛就该纯白一色，不容异彩。
      “别走了，快回去休息！”我终于忍不住对他说。口气是命令式的，以显示护士的威严。
      “对不起，护士大姐。明天就不走了。容我今天吧。”
    明天？手术！我恍然。
      “再也不走了，不走了，不走了、不……”他喃喃低语，痛彻人心。眼里滚动着莹光。
    人与人，到底有多少剪不断的丝缕相连哟，层层叠叠，绵绵絮絮，如网如麻。此刻，他渴望走，需要扶助。这里，只有我。是责任？是义务？是必须？当然，可以什么也不想，也就什么也不是。天使，天使也需要睡觉。困了，尽管趴在桌上打盹。
    可是，声声请求，点点泪光，便足以改变人心的律动。
    我把他的拐杖立在一边，搀扶着他，在走廊里来回走着、走着……对于我，这一夜，很长。对于他呢？
    病房，仍是纯白一色，连同那流逝的时光。
    他要出院了。护士们来送他。在人搀扶下，他单腿站立，深深地鞠躬。临走，他塞给我一封信。
    信的内容使我怔然懵懂，脸热辣辣的，像错收了一份本应是送与他人的厚礼。我极力回想，为他所做的事都极其平常，打针、换药、洗脸、端饭，还有找本书、捎口信，再有就是手术前的那个夜晚。说实话，那会儿，我好困，想打个盹。
    仅这些，就能使人获得
  “恩重如山”的感受吗？
    那信，通篇反复就这四个字。
