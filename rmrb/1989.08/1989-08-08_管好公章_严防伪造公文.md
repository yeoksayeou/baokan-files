Properly Manage Official Seals and Strictly Prevent Forged Documents

Due to work-related reasons, I have come across numerous cases of Party members and cadres violating discipline or committing crimes. I have noticed a problem worth paying attention to: some people take advantage of their positions or work opportunities to provide blank letterheads with official seals to lawbreakers to forge official documents, thereby accepting bribes.

For example, in May 1987, Zhang Zonglin, the head of the Xuanwei County Township Enterprises Office in Kunming, requested that Xu Xinyuan, the former deputy director of the Provincial Construction Commission Office, help him obtain a permit for tin ore to leave the province. Xu Xinyuan agreed but demanded a handling fee. On May 19, Xu Xinyuan handed over a blank letterhead with the seal of the Provincial Planning Commission Office, which he had privately kept from his time working at the Provincial Planning Commission, to Zhang Zonglin. He instructed Zhang Zonglin to forge a permit for 500 tons of tin ore to leave the province, allowing over 35 tons of tin ore to be illegally transported out of the province, thereby gaining illegal profits. Xu Xinyuan received a bribe of 14,700 yuan from this. On June 18, 1987, Xu Xinyuan, at the request of Ning Borui, the foreman of the Xuanwei County Vibrant Construction Company, handed over two blank letterheads with the seal of the Provincial Planning Commission Office to Ning Borui and demanded a handling fee of 500 yuan. After the case was exposed, Xu Xinyuan returned all the illicit money totaling 19,700 yuan, was expelled from the Party, and sentenced to seven years in prison.

Shen Xuegui, the former deputy director of the Kunming Institute of Electronics, participated in an economic fraud gang starting in 1986, defrauding over 18,000 yuan. To facilitate this group of fraudsters, Shen Xuegui stole seven blank introduction letters with the seal of the Kunming Institute of Electronics. After the case was exposed, Shen Xuegui was expelled from the Party and sentenced to three years in prison.

I hope that all units will strengthen the management of official seals, especially to thoroughly clean up blank letterheads and blank introduction letters with official seals, to prevent criminals from taking advantage of any opportunities.

### 管好公章  严防伪造公文

    管好公章  严防伪造公文
    因工作关系，我接触过不少党员干部违纪或违法犯罪的案件，发现一个值得注意的问题：有的人利用职务或工作之便，将盖有公章的空白信笺提供给不法分子伪造公文，从中收受贿赂。
    例如，1987年5月，我省宣威县乡镇企业局驻昆明办事处主任张宗林，要求省建委办公室原副主任徐鑫泉帮助办一份锡砂出省证明。徐鑫泉表示同意，但提出要手续费。5月19日，徐鑫泉将原在省计委工作期间私自保留的、盖有省计委办公室公章的一张空白信笺交给张宗林，授意张宗林伪造一份省计委批准500吨锡砂的出省证明，将35吨多锡砂私自倒运出省，牟取暴利。徐鑫泉从中受贿1.47万元。1987年6月18日，徐鑫泉应宣威县振兴建筑公司包工头宁伯瑞的要求，又将两张盖有省计委办公室公章的空白信笺交给宁伯瑞，并向宁索要手续费500元。案发后，徐鑫泉退出了全部赃款19700元，被开除党籍，判刑7年。
    昆明电科所办公室原副主任沈学贵，1986年以来参加经济诈骗团伙，诈骗钱财1.8万多元。为了给这伙诈骗者提供方便，沈学贵窃取盖有昆明电科所公章的空白介绍信笺7张。案发后，沈学贵被开除党籍，判刑3年。
    希望各单位加强对公章的保管，特别要对盖有公章的空白信笺、空白介绍信作认真的清理，不给犯罪分子以可乘之机。
