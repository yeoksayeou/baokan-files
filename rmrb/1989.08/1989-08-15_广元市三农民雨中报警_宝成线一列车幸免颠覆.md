The Chengdu Railway Bureau today announced the commendation of three farmers from Guangyuan City, Sichuan, who, in a critical moment during a heavy rain-induced landslide, cleverly signaled to prevent a train derailment. The three farmers, Zhao Guoshu, Yang Jinshu, and Yang Wenyi, were each awarded 100 yuan.

On the morning of August 11th, a landslide occurred near the entrance of the Miaoziling Tunnel on the Baocheng Line, covering 25 cubic meters of mud and rocks over the railway. This location is on a curve, making it difficult for the driver to see clearly. Passing by this area, the three farmers, Zhao Guoshu, Yang Jinshu, and Yang Wenyi, quickly took safety measures upon discovering the danger. Yang Jinshu sent his son, Yang Wenyi, to signal the train coming from the Baoji direction, while he and Zhao Guoshu went to stop the train coming from the Chengdu direction. Just then, a freight train from the Chengdu direction rushed towards them. Yang and Zhao immediately shouted and waved their hands, cleverly using a red umbrella to signal danger. The train driver immediately applied the emergency brake, stopping the train just short of the accident site, thus avoiding a potential train derailment.

    广元市三农民雨中报警  宝成线一列车幸免颠覆
    本报成都8月14日电　成都铁路分局今天通报表彰了在暴雨造成塌方的关键时刻，机智地打信号，有效地防止了一起列车颠覆事故的四川广元市农民赵国书、杨金书、杨文义3人，同时给他们分别奖励100元。
    8月11日上午10时半，宝成线庙子岭隧道口不远处突然塌方，有25立方米的泥石覆盖铁路。这里地处弯道，司机了望条件较差。路过此地的赵国书3位农民发现险情后，果断地采取安全措施，杨金书让其子杨文义向宝鸡方向去给列车发信号，他和赵国书朝成都方向去拦停列车。就在这时，从成都方向一列货车急速驶来，杨、赵立即大声呼喊、挥手，并机智地张开红色雨伞报警。机车司机立即紧急制动，列车距出事地点不远处停下，从而避免了一场列车颠覆事故。
