The Soviet Union's parliament on August 3 called on all countries to work towards the early signing of an international convention banning the production, stockpiling, and use of all chemical weapons.

In January, 149 countries met in Paris to discuss the issue of banning chemical weapons and adopted the "Final Declaration," condemning the use of such weapons and calling for the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention to ban chemical weapons.

The Soviet parliament believes that parliamentarians can play an important role in urging their respective countries to participate in the drafting of the future convention. To this end, the Soviet parliament has made three proposals: first, the Inter-Parliamentary Union should hold a meeting in the near future to discuss how parliaments can contribute to accelerating the drafting of the convention to ban chemical weapons; second, it is requested that the Geneva Disarmament Conference provide the opportunity for parliamentarians to meet in Geneva to understand the progress of the negotiations; third, under the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, meetings or discussions should be held to study the role that parliamentarians can play in promoting the entry into force of the future convention.

According to reports from major U.S. newspapers, the Soviet Union recently accepted a U.S. proposal to conduct inspections of chemical weapons before the formal signing of a chemical weapons ban treaty. This concession by the Soviet Union was made by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker in Paris last week. According to the agreed procedure between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, each country will submit information on the locations and data of its stored and produced chemical weapons, followed by inspections to determine the quantity of chemical weapons held by each side. U.S. government officials said that the Soviet concession resolved a major disagreement between the two countries, paving the way for the Geneva Disarmament Conference to complete the chemical weapons ban treaty. However, there are still some disagreements that need to be resolved.

    苏呼吁签订禁止化学武器公约
    同意美国建议首先核查化学武器
    新华社莫斯科8月3日电  苏联议会3日呼吁各国为尽早签订一项关于禁止生产、贮存和使用一切化学武器的国际公约而努力。
    今年1月，149个国家在巴黎开会，讨论禁止化学武器问题，并通过了《最后宣言》，谴责使用这类武器，同时要求早日缔结一项全面禁止化学武器的国际公约。
    苏联议会认为，各国议员在促使自己国家参加制订未来公约方面能起重要作用。苏联议会为此提出3点建议，一，各国议会联盟在近期举行一次会议，讨论议会为加速制订禁止化学武器公约应作哪些贡献的问题；二，吁请日内瓦裁军会议提供可能，以便议员们在日内瓦会晤谈判中了解会谈进展情况；三，在各国议会联盟的主持下举行会晤或讨论会，研究议员在促使未来公约生效方面能起哪些作用的问题。
    本报华盛顿8月2日电  据美国主要报纸报道，苏联不久前接受美国的一项建议，同意在正式签订禁止化学武器条约前，对化学武器先进行核查。苏联的这一让步是苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽上周在巴黎会见美国国务卿贝克时作出的。根据美苏同意的程序，各国将提交本国储存和生产化学武器的地点和资料，然后进行核查，以确定各方化学武器的数量。美国政府官员称，苏联的让步解决了两国之间的一个主要分歧，为日内瓦裁军谈判会议完成禁止化学武器条约铺平了道路，但双方仍有一些分歧需要加以解决。
