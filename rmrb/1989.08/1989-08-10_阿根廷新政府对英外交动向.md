After the new government of Argentina took office, the most notable move in its foreign relations was its willingness to restore normal relations with Britain. President Menem called for the resumption of negotiations to normalize relations between the two countries without discussing the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. This appeal has received a positive response from Britain. Argentina is prepared to formally declare the end of the state of hostility and has already lifted restrictions on the import of British goods. It seems that the long-stalled Argentina-Britain relations may have a chance to ease.

In April 1982, Argentina and Britain engaged in the Malvinas Islands War, leading to the suspension of diplomatic relations and economic trade between the two countries. Although the United Nations General Assembly passes resolutions each year calling for negotiations to resolve the Malvinas dispute, informal contacts between the two sides have continued. However, the dispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands has effectively prevented formal negotiations from taking place.

The state of hostility between Argentina and Britain not only frequently creates tension in the southern waters of Argentina but also directly affects Argentina's economic exchanges with the European Community. Western Europe is a traditional market for Argentine products and a major source of funds. In recent years, Argentina has signed bilateral cooperation agreements with individual European Community member states Italy and Spain. However, as an economic union, the European Community, due to the confrontation between its member state Britain and Argentina, cannot engage in normal economic cooperation with Argentina.

Currently, Argentina is facing a severe shortage of funds and economic stagnation, urgently needing to expand its export markets and seek external funding. The economic integration of the European Community is about to reach a higher level. In this context, the stalemate in Argentina-Britain relations is highly unfavorable for Argentina. It is generally believed that the Menem government's new strategy on the Malvinas issue is based on this consideration.

Given that the country is facing an unprecedented economic and social crisis, the Argentine government has adjusted its foreign policy. In his inaugural address, President Menem explained the principles of economic independence and political sovereignty proposed by the founder of the Justicialist Party, General Perón, as follows: For this government, economic independence means ending the stagnant state, achieving victory in production and development; economic independence is about developing mineral resources, increasing exports, and engaging in fair trade with other countries; advocating a constructive concept of sovereignty, integrating Argentina with the world, and ensuring that opportunities outweigh risks.

In discussing the differences between the new government's foreign policy and that of the previous administration, Foreign Minister Cavallo stated that Argentina's traditional principles of foreign policy will continue to be implemented, but the forms and methods of handling bilateral relations with other countries on the international stage will change. He explicitly stated that Argentina is experiencing a severe economic crisis with serious social consequences, and this government seeks a favorable international environment. Therefore, it will focus its efforts on discussing issues related to the country's problems.

The above statements give the impression that the core and fundamental starting point of Argentina's foreign policy is to serve the country's economic and social interests. From this overall policy, Argentina will likely take the initiative to break the stalemate in Argentina-Britain relations and adopt flexible approaches in its foreign relations as needed. Its stance on some major international issues may also undergo certain changes.

    阿根廷新政府对英外交动向
    本报记者　李志明
    阿根廷新政府就职后，在对外关系上最引人注目的动作是表示愿意同英国恢复正常关系。梅内姆总统呼吁在不讨论马岛主权的条件下恢复两国关系正常化的谈判，此项呼吁已得到英国的积极响应。阿根廷准备宣布正式结束敌对状态，并已取消对进口英国产品的限制。由此看来，多年陷入僵局的阿英关系有松动的可能。
    一九八二年四月，阿根廷和英国之间发生了马尔维纳斯群岛战争，两国的外交关系及经济贸易交往随之中断。虽然联合国大会每年都通过决议要求阿英两国谈判解决马岛争端，双方也一直保持着非正式接触，但是关于马岛主权的争执使双方正式谈判实际上未能举行。
    阿英关系实际上所处的敌对状态，不仅使阿根廷南部海域经常出现紧张气氛，而且直接影响到阿根廷与欧洲共同体的经济往来。西欧是阿根廷产品的传统市场和资金的主要来源之一。近年来，阿根廷与欧共体个别成员国意大利及西班牙分别签署了双边合作协议，但是欧共体作为一个经济联合体，碍于其成员国英国与阿根廷的对抗，不能与阿根廷进行正常的经济合作。
    目前，阿根廷资金短缺，经济停滞日益严重，极需扩大外销市场寻求外部资金，而欧共体的经济一体化即将跨入更高层次。在这种形势下，阿英关系的僵持局面对阿根廷很不利，一般认为，梅内姆政府在马岛问题将可能采取的新策略，正是基于这种考虑。
    鉴于国家处于前所未有的经济社会危机中，阿根廷政府对外交政策进行了调整。梅内姆总统在就职演说中，对正义党创始人庇隆将军提出的经济独立、政治主权原则，作了如下解释：对本届政府来说，经济独立意味着结束停滞状态，生产取得胜利，发展取得胜利；经济独立就是开发矿藏、增加出口、与其他国家公平贸易；主张一种建设性的主权概念，使阿根廷与世界联为一体，使机会多于风险。
    外交部长卡瓦洛在谈到新政府与上届政府的外交政策的区别时说，阿根廷外交政策的传统原则将继续实行，但将改变出现于国际讲坛上的形式和处理与他国双边关系的方式。他明确表示，阿根廷正经历一场社会后果极其严重的经济危机，本届政府谋求一种有利的国际环境，因此将把主要精力用于讨论与本国问题有关的题目。
    上述表示给人们这样一种印象；阿根廷外交政策的核心和基本出发点是服务于本国的经济社会利益，从这一总方针出发，阿根廷将会以打破阿英关系僵局为开端，在对外关系上视需要采取灵活作法，在一些重大国际问题上的态度也可能发生某些变化。
