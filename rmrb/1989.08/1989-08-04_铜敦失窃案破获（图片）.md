Recently, the theft of the bronze ding from the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall in Zichuan County, Hubei, was solved in Jianli County, Hubei. The thieves, Li Jinfei, Li Jianxin, Yang Tongxin, Li Mu Ping, Li Youping, and the accomplices in transporting the stolen artifacts, Wang Yuanqing and Li Zhongming, have been arrested by the police.

The valuable artifacts from the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall were stolen on June 4, 1988. The thieves climbed up to the second floor, broke into the exhibition hall through a window, and stole nine precious artifacts from the Warring States period, including a bronze ding with a coiled dragon pattern. The bronze ding was later seen at the Sotheby's auction house in New York in October of the same year.

Currently, the public security authorities have seized four artifacts that have not yet been sold, including a bronze ding without flowers, a bronze pot, a gold ornament, and a set of bells. They have also recovered stolen money and artifacts worth a total of 460,000 yuan.

After the bronze ding was smuggled into the United States, relevant Chinese authorities, through multiple negotiations with the American side, finally retrieved the bronze ding from New York on May 29 this year.

	National treasure - the Bronze Ding from the Warring States period. It was an ancient food vessel and also a precious gift.

    铜敦失窃案破获
    湖北秭归县屈原纪念馆战国铜敦失窃大案最近在湖北监利县破获。盗窃分子栗金飞、李建新、杨同新、栗木平、李又平和盗运文物分子王元清、李忠明7人已被依法逮捕。
    屈原纪念馆的珍贵文物是于1988年6月4日被盗的。窃贼搭梯攀上二楼撬窗进入展厅，偷走蟠龙纹铜敦等战国时期的珍贵文物9件，其中铜敦于同年10月在美国纽约索斯比拍卖行露面。
    目前，公安机关已缴获尚未销赃的文物无花铜敦、铜壶、金饰器、编钟共4件，追回赃款赃物共值46万余元。
    战国铜敦被盗运美国后，我国有关方面经与美方多次交涉，今年5月29日，铜敦终于从纽约“完璧归赵”。
