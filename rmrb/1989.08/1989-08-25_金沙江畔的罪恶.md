Eyewitness Account:

Since 1974, the state has utilized the Yalong River and Jinsha River for timber rafting. Both Sichuan and Yunnan provinces have issued regulations to protect the timber. However, in the sections of the river within the borders of Yongshan, Zhaotong, Ludian, and Qiaojia counties in Yunnan, the local people openly seize, cut, chop, and intercept the rafting timber during the flood season. Over the past sixteen years, timber worth over 1.6 billion yuan has been stolen by these individuals.

On July 6th, along a stretch of road less than ten kilometers long in Jinyang County, I saw twenty-seven timber theft sites on the opposite bank. The remnants of wood and debris covered the sandy shore, and people were constantly carrying, dragging, and hauling the timber back and forth without any hesitation. They were openly fighting over and seizing the timber in the river, and the noise of people and horses continued day and night along the shore. When will this evil under the sun and the lamplight finally come to an end?

    金沙江畔的罪恶
    一九七四年以来，国家利用雅砻江、金沙江漂运木材。川滇两省也曾颁布保护漂木的条令。可是云南省永善、昭通、鲁甸、巧家县境内江段一岸的群众，每到洪水季节，就公开捞、砍、劈、截漂木，十六年来已有价值十六亿多元的木料被这些人窃为私有。
    七月六日，在金阳县不足十公里的沿江公路上，我就看到对岸有二十七个窃木场，这些场点的残木余渣遍白沙岸，背、抬、扛、拖漂木的人往返不息，毫无顾忌地在江里争捞游夺，沿岸昼夜人喧马嘶。不知这阳光（下图）和灯光（左图）下的罪恶何时才能终止！？
