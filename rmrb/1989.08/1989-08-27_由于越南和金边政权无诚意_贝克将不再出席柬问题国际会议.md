Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 25th.

The U.S. State Department said today that, given the lack of progress in the international conference on the Cambodian issue currently being held in Paris, U.S. Secretary of State Baker will not attend the ministerial-level meeting scheduled for next week.

State Department spokesman Boucher said that since Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime have shown no sincerity during this conference, "a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue is not currently in sight." However, Boucher said, the United States will send Richard Solomon, the official in charge of East Asian and Pacific affairs, to attend the conference scheduled for August 28 to 30.

    由于越南和金边政权无诚意
    贝克将不再出席柬问题国际会议
    据新华社华盛顿8月25日电　美国国务院今天说，鉴于正在巴黎举行的柬埔寨问题国际会议并未取得进展，美国国务卿贝克将不出席该大会下星期召开的部长级会议。
    国务院发言人鲍切说，由于越南和金边政权在这次大会期间并无诚意，因此，“全面解决柬埔寨问题的方法目前并不可见。”然而，鲍切说，美国将派遣负责东亚及太平洋事务的理查德·所罗门出席于8月28日至30日召开的会议。
