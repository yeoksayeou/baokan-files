The State Taxation Bureau Issues a Notice to Rectify the Tax Order of Individual Industrial and Commercial Households

Today, the State Taxation Bureau has widely posted the "Notice on Rectifying the Tax Order of Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Households" across the country.

The "Notice" points out that tax laws are an important part of national laws, and it is the duty of every citizen to pay taxes in accordance with the law. However, at present, some individual industrial and commercial households have serious issues with tax evasion and avoidance, and some even openly refuse to pay taxes. To uphold tax discipline, in accordance with the "Decision of the State Council on Rectifying Tax Order and Strengthening Tax Administration," it is decided that from August to September 1989, a comprehensive inspection and rectification of the tax order of urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households will be carried out nationwide.

The "Notice" contains 10 clauses:

1. All individual industrial and commercial households engaged in industrial, commercial, transportation, construction installation, catering services, repair and assembly, and other business activities in urban and rural areas must, within 20 days of the issuance of this "Notice," conduct a self-inspection of their tax payments since 1988 and report the results truthfully to the tax authorities.

2. Individual industrial and commercial households must comply with national tax laws, pay taxes in accordance with the law, and accept supervision and management by tax authorities.

3. Individual industrial and commercial households must, within 30 days of obtaining a business license or starting operations, go to the local tax authorities to apply for tax registration. If there are any changes in the registration information, they must, within 30 days of the change, report to the competent tax authorities to apply for a change in registration or re-registration, or cancellation of registration.

4. Individual industrial and commercial households must establish accounts in accordance with the regulations of the tax authorities, keep accurate records, and correctly calculate their taxes.

5. Individual industrial and commercial households must purchase, use, and keep invoices in accordance with the regulations of the tax authorities, issue and obtain invoices truthfully, and must not lose invoices. It is strictly forbidden to reuse, lend, transfer, issue on behalf of others, alter, privately print, sell, or forge invoices.

6. Individual industrial and commercial households must submit tax return forms, financial statements, and other tax-related materials to the tax authorities in accordance with the regulations. They must truthfully declare and pay taxes. It is strictly forbidden to falsify information, evade taxes, or engage in tax avoidance. Individual industrial and commercial households that pay taxes on a fixed-period, fixed-amount basis must report to the competent tax authorities to adjust the fixed amount when their income increases to the level specified by the tax authorities.

7. Individual industrial and commercial households operating outside their registered area must apply to the competent tax authorities for a tax management certificate for out-of-area operations and report to the tax authorities in the operating area for verification and registration, accepting tax management. Those who go out to sell or purchase goods must carry the tax management certificate for out-of-area operations or purchase invoices issued by the tax authorities, with the goods and invoices matching.

8. If individual industrial and commercial households have disputes with tax authorities regarding tax payments or penalties, they must first pay the taxes, late payment fees, and fines in accordance with the decisions of the tax authorities.

9. Any unit or individual has the right to report, expose, and stop individual industrial and commercial households from evading taxes and other violations of tax regulations. Those who report such violations will not be retaliated against. Tax authorities should widely mobilize the masses to report tax evasion, set up reporting mailboxes and hotlines, and keep the reporters' identities confidential and reward them according to regulations.

10. For individual industrial and commercial households that voluntarily discover and report their own issues, they can be dealt with leniently, only requiring them to pay the outstanding taxes without fines or with reduced fines; for those who do not conduct a thorough self-inspection or refuse to self-inspect and are found out, they should be severely punished; for those whose actions constitute a crime, they should be handed over to judicial authorities for criminal prosecution.

The "Notice" also clarifies that the inspection and rectification of the tax order of private enterprises will be carried out in accordance with this "Notice."

    整顿个体工商业户税收秩序
    本报北京8月1日讯　今天，国家税务局在全国城乡广为张贴《关于整顿城乡个体工商业户税收秩序的通告》。
    《通告》指出，税法是国家法律的重要组成部分，依法纳税是每个公民应尽的义务。但是，当前一些个体工商业户偷税漏税的情况比较严重，有的甚至公开抗税不缴。为了严肃税收法纪，根据《国务院关于整顿税收秩序加强税收管理的决定》，定于1989年8月至9月在全国范围内对城乡个体工商业户税收秩序进行全面的检查整顿。
    《通告》内容共10条：
    一、一切从事工业、商业、交通运输、建筑安装、饮食服务、修理装配以及其它经营活动的城乡个体工商业户，必须自《通告》发布之日起20日内对1988年以来的纳税进行自查，并将自查情况如实报告税务机关。
    二、个体工商业户必须遵守国家税法，依法纳税，接受税务机关监督管理。
    三、个体工商业户必须自领取营业执照或开业之日起30日内到当地税务机关申报办理税务登记。登记事项如有变化，必须自发生变化之日起30日内，向主管税务机关申报办理变更登记或重新登记、注销登记。
    四、个体工商业户必须按照税务机关的规定建帐，如实记帐，正确核算。
    五、个体工商业户必须按照税务机关的规定购买、使用、保管发票，如实开具、取得发票，不得丢失发票。严禁重用、转借、转让、代开、涂改、私印、私售、倒卖和伪造发票。
    六、个体工商业户必须按照税务机关的规定报送纳税申报表、财务会计报表和其它有关纳税资料，如实申报纳税。严禁弄虚作假、偷税漏税。
    实行定期定额缴税的个体工商业户，在收入额增长幅度达到税务机关规定的申报幅度时，必须向主管税务机关申报调整定额。
    七、到外地经营的个体工商业户，必须向主管税务机关申请领取外出经营税收管理证明，并向经营地税务机关报验登记，接受税务管理。凡外出销售或购买商品、货物的个体工商业户，必须持税务机关开具的外出经营税收管理证明或购货发票，货票同行。
    八、个体工商业户同税务机关在纳税或违章处理问题上发生争议时，必须首先按照税务机关的决定缴纳税款、滞纳金、罚款。
    九、对个体工商业户偷税漏税和其它违反税收法规的行为，任何单位和个人都有权检举、揭发和制止。对检举揭发者，不得打击报复。税务机关应广泛发动群众检举揭发偷税漏税行为，设立举报信箱和电话，并为检举者保密和按规定给予奖励。
    十、对个体工商业户主动自查出的问题，可以从宽处理，只补税，不罚款或少罚款；对自查不认真或拒不自查而被查出的问题，应从严处罚；对情节严重、构成犯罪的，应移送司法机关依法追究其刑事责任。
    《通告》还明确说明，对私营企业税收秩序的检查整顿比照该《通告》执行。
