In a courtyard filled with blooming flowers on Linqiao South Road in Lhasa, Tibet, resides the Langtang family. The late elder father was the former vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress, Langtang Gonge Wangqiu, who was the nephew of the 13th Dalai Lama. This relationship makes the family highly influential in Tibet.

This is a patriotic family. In 1951, when Tibet was peacefully liberated, the People's Liberation Army's 18th Army entered Lhasa. At that time, Gonge Wangqiu, who served as the chief of the Kashag government, generously offered a building and a park to the PLA. The Langtang family's love and help for the PLA are countless. In 1959, when the reactionary forces of the local Tibetan government staged an armed rebellion, the Langtang family firmly upheld national unity. Gonge Wangqiu's eldest daughter, Baimu, bravely gave speeches on the streets, advocating for patriotism and unity. In the 1980s, the winds of reform and opening up blew into the plateau. The 80-year-old mother, Ciren Wangmu (who passed away in April this year), resolutely contributed 200,000 yuan of family property to start a moderately-sized Zaxi Hotel with her children, becoming the first individually-operated tourist hotel in Lhasa.

This is a family that gathers cultural elites. If the father of the 13th Dalai Lama, Gonge Renqing, became the first generation of the Langtang family due to being granted the title of duke, then the fourth generation now stands tall. The fourth generation are mostly middle-aged intellectuals in their forties and fifties. The aforementioned Baimu is a member of the National Drama Association and the deputy director of the Tibetan Opera Troupe. The eldest son, Banjue, is a writer who writes in Tibetan and has won multiple awards domestically, currently serving as the deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The second daughter, Ciren Zoma, works in translation, and her husband, Cheren Jinmei, has made significant achievements in studying Tibetan literature and is now a visiting scholar in Japan. The second son, Gongbao Cidan, works in a bank and is the only financial expert in the family. The fifth generation is the most vibrant generation in the family, with graduates from the Beijing Dance Academy and Sichuan Music Academy, painters, doctors studying abroad, and engineering students at Tibet University. Now, the sixth generation is already playing around.

This is one of the most modern families in Lhasa. The fourth and fifth generations, whether in thinking, speech, or lifestyle, will not make one think of the farming family in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. I asked Banjue about his hometown "Langtang," and he expressed a desire to trace his roots but knew very little about it.

The car traveled at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour along the Yarlung Zangbo River to the east. I was thinking about Chongxi (Chong means birthplace, and Xi is a manor) all the way.

On May 5, 1876, the reincarnated soul child who was later confirmed to be the 13th Dalai Lama was born in a ordinary farming family in Langtang Village. At that time, the 12th Dalai Lama had been deceased for more than a year. To find the soul child, the Kashag government invited the 8th Panchen Lama to cast lots, and then successively invited the Samye Monastery and Nyenchen Thangla Monastery to invoke spirits, and went to Qokhor Lake to see the reflection. Finally, after secret investigations, it was confirmed that it was the son of Gonge Renqing, a farmer in Langtang Village. In March 1877, the Guangxu Emperor approved the memorial and exempted the golden urn drawing (lottery confirmation). After that, the village name was changed from "in front of the elephant mountain" (Langtang) to "birthplace" (Chongxi).

After crossing the Jacha Mountain, the driver suddenly pointed to a lush area on the north bank of the river: "Look, that's Chongxi." Oh, what a charming place. That day was May 5, the birthday of the 13th Dalai Lama, a wonderful coincidence.

Whether it was due to unfamiliarity or closeness, when we interviewed the village cadres, the onlookers surrounded the office building so tightly that not a drop of water could pass through. The young people pushed and shoved, and everyone vied to answer our questions before the village head. When taking photos, young people, including young monks from nearby temples, all gathered around. The little children followed and jumped excitedly, as if a grand festival was about to arrive.

The village is not very wealthy. There are 38 households, with a total of 187 people, 435 head of livestock, and 318 acres of cultivated land, with an average yield of 450 jin per acre. Last year, the per capita net income was 392 yuan. In addition to being self-sufficient in grain and vegetables, digging caterpillar fungus and selling walnuts are the main sources of income. The older people in the village used to be beggars, so they are very content. What they hope for is to have electricity and enough butter tea, but what we regret is that the village only has a primary school. Students who want to go to a complete primary school have to walk 25 kilometers to Lang County, so few go, which is a pity for those intelligent and lovely children.

The house where the Dalai Lama was born is still there, and the village is thus officially named "Chongkang" (Kang: house). The locals light incense to the "Chongkang" every morning, which is also their main religious activity. They are still very devout, but when they casually mention "wanting electricity," they still rely on and expect the people's government.

The Elephant Mountain is vaguely visible, and "Langtang" by the Yarlung Zangbo River has been forever left in Lhasa.

	Graduated from the Beijing Dance Academy, Bai Jia is the fifth generation of the Langtang family. She is currently a performer with the Tibet Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe. Her solo dance "Spring" won the third prize in the second National Dance Competition. The 24-year-old Bai Jia is currently a member of the Tibet Autonomous Region Youth Federation.

    朗顿与冲溪
    本报记者　卢小飞
    西藏拉萨林廓南路一所种满鲜花的大院里，住着朗顿一家。已故的老阿爸是原西藏自治区人大常委会副主任朗顿·贡噶旺秋是十三世达赖的嫡侄，这层关系使这个家族在西藏举足轻重。
    这是个爱国之家。1951年西藏和平解放，人民解放军十八军进驻拉萨。当时任噶厦政府司伦的贡噶旺秋慷慨让出家里的一栋楼和一片林卡给解放军住。朗顿一家对解放军的热爱与帮助是说不完的。1959年，西藏地方政府反动势力武装叛乱，朗顿一家坚决维护祖国统一，贡噶旺秋的大女儿白姆冒着危险在街头演讲，宣传爱国、统一。八十年代，改革开放之风吹进高原，年届八旬的阿妈次仁旺姆（今年四月逝世）毅然拿出20万元家产，和孩子们办起小有规模的扎喜旅馆，成为拉萨第一个个体经营的旅游饭店。
    这是个荟萃了文化界名流的众口之家。如果说十三世达赖的父亲贡噶仁钦因受封公爵而成为朗顿世家的第一代，那么如今鼎立门户的当是第四代。第四代大都是四五十岁的中年知识分子。前面提到的白姆是全国戏剧家协会的会员、藏剧团副团长。长子班觉是用藏文写作并多次在国内获奖的作家，现任中共拉萨市委宣传部副部长。二女儿次仁卓玛搞翻译工作，他丈夫车仁
  ·晋美研究西藏文学颇有成就，如今赴日做访问学者。二儿子贡保次旦在银行工作，是家里唯一的金融家。第五代是家里朝气蓬勃的一代，有北京舞蹈学院和四川音乐学院毕业的文艺工作者，有画家，有正留学海外的医生，还有西藏大学的理工科学生。如今，第六代也已满地玩耍了。
    这是拉萨最具现代气息的家庭之一，第四代和第五代，无论是思维、谈吐，还是生活方式，都绝不会使人联想到雅鲁藏布江中下游的那户农家。我向班觉问起了故乡“朗顿”，他流露出寻根的热望，但却知之甚少。
    汽车以每小时70公里的速度沿雅鲁藏布江东去。我一路想着冲溪（冲意为诞生地，溪是庄园）。
    1876年5月5日，那个后来被确认为是十三世达赖的转世灵童降生在朗顿村一户普通农家。此时，十二世达赖圆寂已一年有余。为寻访灵童，噶厦政府请八世班禅打卦问卜，又先后请桑耶寺和乃冏寺降神，并到曲科甲圣母湖看显影，最后经密查暗访，确认就是朗顿村农民贡噶仁钦的儿子。1877年3月，光绪皇帝在奏折上批示认定，并免予金瓶掣签（抽签认定）。那以后，村名也由“象山前面”（朗顿）改称“诞生地”（冲溪）了。
    翻过加查山，司机忽然指着江北的一片葱茏：“瞧，那就是冲溪。”哦，好一处幽雅的所在。那天是5月5日，正是十三世达赖的诞生日，绝妙的巧合。
    不知是隔膜还是亲近，在我们采访村干部的时候，观摩者竟把队部围得水泄不通，青少年们拥前挤后，七嘴八舌地抢在村长前面回答我们的问题。照相的时候，年轻人、包括附近寺庙的小僧都凑上来，小娃娃们尾随着、雀跃着，那情形仿佛盛大节日来临。
    这村不算富裕。38户人家，男女老少187人，牲畜435头（只），耕地318亩，平均亩产450斤，去年人均纯收入392元。除了粮食、蔬菜自给有余外，挖虫草、卖核桃是来钱的主要门路。村里年长些的，过去大都当过乞丐，因而非常知足。他们盼望的事情是安上电灯和吃上足够的酥油，而我们感到遗憾的是村里只有“初小”，小学生们要上“完小”得步行25公里到朗县，因而去者寥寥，可惜了那些聪明可爱的孩子。
    达赖诞生的房子还在，这个村由此对外正名为“冲康”
  （康：房子）。当地人每日清晨要给“冲康”上香，这也是他们主要的宗教活动。他们依然虔诚无比，可当他们脱口说出“想安电灯”的时候，他们信赖与期待的还是人民政府。
    象山依稀可见，而雅鲁藏布江边上的“朗顿”已经永远地留在拉萨。
