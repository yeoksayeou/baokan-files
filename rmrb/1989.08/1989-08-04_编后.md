In 1987, some regions across the country saw a decline in pig production, leading to a shortage of pork, rising meat prices, and difficulties in obtaining meat in some cities. The state had to allocate a significant amount of funds for subsidies, which is still fresh in people's minds. After the state implemented a series of supportive policies for farmers to raise pigs last year, the situation improved somewhat. However, pig production is facing another crisis this year, and it is estimated that by the end of this year to the beginning of next year, the problem of difficulty in obtaining meat may reoccur. This is not an exaggeration. The investigations and calls from the countryside published here reveal this information.

These investigations have summarized some regular issues in pig production, pointing out the reasons why pig production has fluctuated repeatedly over the years. One of the most commonly mentioned issues is the lack of consistent policies from relevant departments to ensure stable pig production. The public's phrase "cut when there is too much, drive when there is too little, and ignore when there is just enough" reflects the instability of policies. Decision-making departments lack long-term vision and neglect overall planning, making it difficult for farmers to see the future and gain benefits, which inevitably affects their enthusiasm for raising pigs.

Relevant departments should seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of pig production in recent years, systematically study the factors affecting pig production, and formulate practical policies that can be consistently implemented. They should also address any new issues that arise in the production, procurement, transportation, and sales of pigs in a timely manner to ensure the continuous and stable development of pig production.

    1987年，全国一些地区生猪生产滑坡，肉源紧张，肉价上涨，一些城镇出现吃肉难，国家财政拿出大量资金进行补贴，人们记忆犹新。去年国家对农民养猪采取了一系列扶持政策后，这个问题有所缓解，但是，今年的生猪生产却又出现危机端倪，预计今年底到明年初，吃肉难的问题有可能再度出现，这不是危言耸听，这里刊登的一组来自农村的调查和呼声就透露出这个信息。
    在这些调查中，都总结出了生猪生产的一些带规律性的问题，指出了多年来生猪生产屡屡产生波动的原因，其中大家意见比较多的，是有关部门对稳定生猪生产缺少一贯性的保障政策，群众所谓的“多了砍，少了赶，不多不少没人管”，就是政策不稳的表现。决策部门缺乏长远眼光，忽视统筹安排，农民看不到前景，得不到实惠，必然影响养猪的积极性。
    有关部门应该认真总结近几年生猪生产的经验教训，对影响生猪生产的因素进行系统研究，制定出切实可行的政策，始终如一地贯彻下去，并随时解决生产、收购、调运、销售各个环节出现的新问题，确保生猪生产持续、稳定地发展。
