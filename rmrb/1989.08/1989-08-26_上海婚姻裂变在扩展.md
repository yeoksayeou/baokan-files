The phenomenon of marriage breakdowns is spreading like a stain, affecting happy families. Shanghai's divorce rate has been increasing year by year. According to statistics from relevant municipal departments, the divorce rate in 1988 was 2.12‰, an increase of 17.13% compared to 1987.

Last year, 25,825 couples in Shanghai applied for divorce through marriage registration offices and courts, with 13,411 couples granted divorces. The remaining 12,414 couples reconciled after mediation. Last year, the divorce rate per thousand people in the city was 2.12, an increase of 0.31 compared to the previous year.

Among the divorce cases handled last year, the majority were due to poor emotional foundations and incompatible personalities. However, there were also new trends: some young men and women hastily obtained marriage certificates for purposes other than marriage, only to separate before even holding a wedding ceremony. Additionally, social phenomena such as the "fever" to go abroad, gambling, and extramarital affairs continued to be significant factors leading to divorce. Furthermore, the number of divorces due to one spouse having a physical illness or sexual incompatibility has been quietly increasing.

Contrary to the rising divorce rate, the number of marriages in Shanghai has been decreasing year by year. Last year, 147,381 couples applied for marriage registration, with 147,018 couples approved. Additionally, 802 marriages involving foreigners, overseas Chinese, and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots were approved, totaling 147,820 approved marriages. Among these, 279,138 were first-time marriages, 14,898 were remarriages, and 464 were remarriages of previously divorced couples. Last year, the marriage rate in the city was 23.45‰, with the number of marriages per thousand people decreasing by 1.4 compared to the previous year.

    上海婚姻裂变在扩展
    婚姻裂变对幸福家庭的覆盖，正在呈浸润型扩展。上海的离婚率出现逐年递增的现象。据市有关部门的统计资料表明，1988年全市的离婚率为2.12‰，比1987年上升17.13％。
    去年，上海向婚姻登记机关、法院提出离婚的有25825对，判决离婚的有13411对，余下的12414对，经过调解，重归于好。去年全市每千人口中的离婚者为2.12人，比前年增加0.31人。
    在去年承接的这些离婚案件中，因感情基础差，性格不合等导致婚姻死亡的仍占大多数，但也出现了一些新的情况，如：一些男女青年为达到婚姻以外的各种目的，草率领取结婚证，最终连婚礼都未举行就分道扬镳，还有社会上的“出国热”、赌博、婚外恋等一些社会现象，仍是造成夫妻离异的重要因素；另外，因夫妻一方有生理疾患或性生活不和的离婚人数也在悄悄地增多。
    同离婚率上升相反的是，上海的结婚人数却在逐年下降。去年全市申请登记结婚的有147381对，准予登记结婚的有147018对。
    另批准涉外及华侨、港澳台同胞结婚登记802对，共计批准结婚登记数147820对。在这些结婚人数中，初婚279138人，再婚14898人，复婚464对。去年全市的结婚率为23.45‰，每千人口的结婚人数比前年减少1.4人。
