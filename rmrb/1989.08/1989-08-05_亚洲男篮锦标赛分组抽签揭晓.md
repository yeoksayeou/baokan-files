The draw for the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship has been announced. The Chinese men's football team's journey to Rome is not yet over, and the Chinese men's basketball team's competition for a ticket to next year's World Championship is about to begin. The Chinese men's basketball team will, for the first time, participate as the host in the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship, which will be held in Beijing from September 15 to 24. The champions and runners-up of this tournament will have the right to represent Asia in the 1990 World Men's Basketball Championship in Argentina.

Today, the draw ceremony for the 15th Asian Men's Basketball Championship was held in Beijing. The president of the Asian Basketball Confederation, Cheng Wancui, came from Hong Kong to preside over the draw. The results of the draw are as follows: Group A: China, Thailand, Singapore, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia; Group B: South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan; Group C: Japan, India, Bahrain, Syria; Group D: Philippines, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Bangladesh. Additionally, Sri Lanka has also registered, but it is not yet decided whether it will participate. The organizing committee of this tournament expressed that they welcome Asian Basketball Confederation members who have not yet registered to continue to register for this largest-scale tournament in the history of the Asian Men's Basketball Championship.

This tournament will first conduct a round-robin within the groups. In the second stage, the top two teams from each of the four groups will be divided into two groups for another round-robin. The first and second place teams from each group will then play a crossover match, with the winner deciding the championship and runner-up, and the loser competing for the bronze medal.

Since 1975, the Chinese team has participated in the Asian Men's Basketball Championship seven times, except for the 1985 13th Championship where they lost, they have won the championship six times. At the beginning of this year, the Chinese men's basketball team was reorganized, with Sun Bang replacing Qian Chenghai as the head coach. In May, the new Chinese men's basketball team consecutively lost to old rivals South Korea and Japan in the Japan International Competition, drawing public attention. It seems that if the Chinese men's basketball team wants to defend their Asian championship title this time, they will face a tough challenge.

    亚洲男篮锦标赛分组抽签揭晓
    本报北京8月5日讯　记者刘小明报道：中国足球队进军罗马的征程还未结束，中国男篮争夺明年世界大赛入场券的比赛又要开始了。中国男篮将首次作为东道主参加9月15日至24日在北京举行的第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛。这次比赛的冠亚军有权代表亚洲参加1990年阿根廷世界男篮锦标赛。
    今天，第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛抽签仪式在京举行。亚篮联主席程万琦专程从香港前来主持抽签。抽签分组结果是：A组：中国、泰国、新加坡、科威特、沙特阿拉伯；B组：南朝鲜、马来西亚、印度尼西亚、伊朗、巴基斯坦；C组：日本、印度、巴林、叙利亚；D组：菲律宾、中国台北、香港、孟加拉国。此外，斯里兰卡也已报名，它能否参赛还未最后决定。本届比赛组委会负责人表示，欢迎还未报名的亚篮联成员继续报名参加这次亚洲男篮锦标赛史上规模最大的赛事。
    此次比赛先进行分组循环赛，第二阶段获四个小组前两名的8个队再分成两个组进行单循环赛，两个组产生第一、第二名后，相互进行交叉赛，胜者决冠亚军，负者争铜牌。
    中国队自1975年起曾7次参加亚洲男篮锦标赛，除1985年第13届锦标赛失利外，共6次夺魁。今年年初，中国男篮重新组建，孙邦接替钱澄海任主教练。5月，新的中国男篮在日本国际比赛中接连负于老对手南朝鲜队和日本队，引起人们关注。看来，中国男篮此次若想蝉联亚洲冠军，将面临艰苦考验。
