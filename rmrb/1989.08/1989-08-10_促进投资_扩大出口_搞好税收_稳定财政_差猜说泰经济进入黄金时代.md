	BANGKOK, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan last night delivered a nationwide radio and television broadcast marking the first anniversary of his government's rule, pointing out that Thailand's economy has entered a golden age and the government will continue to strive to complete various economic development plans.

The government has provided various conveniences for investors, accelerated the implementation of the East Coast and Southern Coastal Development Plan, so that in the future, Thai products will not have to be exported through Bangkok. Due to the adoption of correct policies and measures, commodity exports have increased by 27% compared to the past, reaching 51 billion baht.

	2. Develop the economy comprehensively and improve the living standards of all people, especially develop the rural economy in the interior. The government held a mobile cabinet meeting to understand local conditions, diagnose and treat problems, and solve problems in a practical and realistic manner. The government also improved the wages of government officials and the minimum wage of ordinary workers while developing the economy, improving people's lives.

	3. The government has made efforts to maintain the balance and stability of the country's financial revenue and expenditure, and manage taxes well. At present, tax revenue has reached over 31 billion baht. To solve the problem of domestic liquidity shortage, the government has allowed the deposit interest rate to float freely, encouraging people to save and accumulate funds for investment.

	Chatchai also pointed out that the Thai government has made efforts to promote peace and stability in the region. The Thai government has taken an active attitude and approach to promote the resolution of the Cambodian issue, so as to eliminate the tense situation in the Indochina Peninsula. The long-term goal of the Thai government is to maintain peace in the region.

    促进投资　扩大出口　搞好税收　稳定财政
    差猜说泰经济进入黄金时代
    本报曼谷8月10日电　记者刘爱成报道：泰国总理差猜·春哈旺昨晚就该政府执政一周年发表全国广播、电视讲话，指出泰国经济已进入黄金时代，政府将继续努力，完成各项经济发展计划。
    差猜总理说，该政府执政一年来，在发展经济方面主要采取了三项措施。
    1、继续促进投资，扩大出口。政府为鼓励投资，向投资者提供了各种方便设施，加快了东海岸及南部沿海发展计划的实施，使未来泰国产品出口不必经过曼谷。由于采取了正确的政策与措施，商品出口比过去增加了27％，达到了5100亿铢。
    2、全面发展经济，提高全民生活水平，尤其是发展内地农村经济。政府举行了巡回内阁会议，了解当地民情，对症下药，实事求是地解决问题。政府还在发展经济的同时，提高政府官员工资及普通工人最低工资，改善人民生活。
    3、政府尽力保持国家财经收支平衡与稳定，搞好税收。目前税收已达310多亿铢。为了解决国内流动资金短缺问题，政府使存款利率自由浮动，鼓励人民储蓄，积累资金，用于投资。
    差猜总理还指出，泰国政府为促使本地区的和平与稳定作出了努力。泰国政府以积极的态度和方法促使柬埔寨问题的解决，以便消除印支国家的紧张局势。泰国政府的长期目标是维护本地区的和平。
