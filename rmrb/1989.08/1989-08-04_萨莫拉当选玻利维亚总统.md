People's Daily, Buenos Aires, August 3rd, reported by Li Zhiming: In the Bolivian election held on May 7th, the left-wing Revolutionary Movement candidate, Paz Estenssoro, who came in third, has become the de facto elected president with the support of General Banzer. He stated that the new government will not make significant changes to the current economic policies and will continue to seek national stability and development.

According to the final election results, the ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement's Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, the Nationalist Democratic Action Party's Hugo Banzer, and the Revolutionary Left Movement's Paz Estenssoro were the top three candidates, but none of them secured more than half of the votes. Therefore, the Congress will decide among them through voting. The three parties have 49, 46, and 41 seats in the Congress, respectively, none of which are enough to reach the required 79 seats for election. Over the past two months, intense negotiations have taken place among the three sides. Yesterday, on the day the Congress convened, Banzer announced his withdrawal from the election, and his party's representatives switched their support to Paz Estenssoro.

Paz Estenssoro is 50 years old and a lawyer by profession. He is the nephew of the current President, Victor Paz Estenssoro.

The new president will take office on August 6th.

    萨莫拉当选玻利维亚总统
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯8月3日电　记者李志明报道：在玻利维亚5月7日大选中得票居第三位的左派革命运动候选人帕斯·萨莫拉在得到班塞尔将军的支持后，已成为实际上的当选总统。他表示，新政府不会对现行经济政策作重大改变，将进一步寻求国家的稳定和发展。
    据公布的大选最后计票结果，执政党民族主义革命运动的贡萨罗·桑切斯·德罗萨达、民族主义民主行动党的乌戈·班塞尔、左派革命运动的帕斯·萨莫拉得票居前三名，但都未超过半数，因此要由议会大会在他们中间投票决定。三个党在议会中的席位分别是49、46和41席，都不够当选所需的79席。两个多月来，三方之间进行了紧张的谈判。昨天，在议会大会召开的当天，班塞尔宣布退出竞选，他的党的议员改为支持帕斯·萨莫拉。
    帕斯·萨莫拉现年50岁，律师职业，是现任总统埃斯登索罗的外甥。
    新总统将于8月6日就职。
