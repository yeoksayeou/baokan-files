In Sweden, a farmer or farm owner typically joins several agricultural cooperatives. These cooperatives have their own unique management styles, and cooperation among different types of cooperatives is quite effective.

We visited Ben Johnson near Lund. He is a member of five cooperatives. The milk he collects daily is picked up, processed, and transported by the local dairy cooperative. His beef cattle are sent to the meat cooperative for slaughter and grading. His grain is sent to the grain sales cooperative, and the timber he logs is piled by the roadside for the forestry cooperative to transport to the wood processing plant. He deposits most of his income into the agricultural cooperative bank.

Johnson took us on a tour of his farm. He has 37 hectares of cultivated land, 12 hectares of which are rented from his neighbors. This land is mainly used to grow wheat, oats, and pasture grass, as well as some winter wheat. His livestock barn houses 30 dairy cows, 22 beef cattle, and 11 young dairy cows. Johnson also has 60 hectares of forest. Apart from hiring a few workers during the busy farming and logging seasons, he and his wife, Orlin, handle most of the farm work themselves. During the off-season, they also find work outside to supplement their income. This farm is considered a medium-sized operation, and about 50% of the 100,000 farms in Sweden are of similar size.

He explained that Sweden's agricultural cooperatives first appeared in the form of sowing and harvesting teams, where farmers helped each other. Since the 1930s, they have developed on a large scale. Currently, there are over 600 agricultural cooperatives across the country, which can be divided into 15 types based on their specialization. More than 90% of farmers and farm owners are members of these cooperatives. About 75% of the agricultural products in the Swedish market come from cooperatives.

We asked Johnson to introduce the organizational structure of the cooperatives. He said that agricultural cooperatives, like other cooperatives, operate on the principles of voluntary membership and democratic management. However, what sets them apart is that the cooperatives and farms operate independently in terms of economics. All expenses related to farm activities are the responsibility of the farm owner, and there is no hierarchical relationship between them. Therefore, a farmer or farm owner can join multiple cooperatives with different specializations. Johnson must pay membership fees to each of the cooperatives he belongs to, and the amount is determined by the quantity of agricultural products he sells to the cooperative. The profits from the cooperative's operations, after setting aside a portion for development, are distributed based on the membership fees. The remaining profits are provided to members in the form of low-cost production materials. The cooperatives do not allow some members to benefit at the expense of others. Johnson has annual production agreements with the cooperatives, and he must sell all his products to the relevant specialized cooperatives, while the cooperatives must purchase all the products.

What benefits do farmers or farm owners gain from joining cooperatives? Johnson mentioned that cooperatives primarily help him with the processing and sales of his products. Since cooperatives have their own processing enterprises and have established fixed supply and sales relationships with consumer cooperatives and supermarkets, the sales channels are guaranteed, and he can obtain relatively good prices. He can also purchase high-quality seeds, fertilizers, feed, and machinery at low prices from the cooperatives. The dairy products and butter his family needs are also purchased at a discounted price from the cooperatives. The cooperatives also help him obtain market and technical information, work with him to formulate production plans, avoid overproduction, and produce as many market-needed products as possible. Additionally, the cooperatives provide services such as agricultural machinery repairs and veterinary care.

Johnson pointed out that cooperatives also play a significant role in stabilizing the market prices of agricultural products. Local agricultural cooperatives and agricultural unions jointly form the National Farmers' Association. According to a bill passed by the Swedish Parliament, the market prices of agricultural products are determined through negotiations among the Farmers' Association, Consumers' Association, and the government, ensuring that prices do not exceed what consumers can afford while guaranteeing the income of farms.

Swedish friends told us that Sweden's arable land accounts for only 1/10 of the total land area, and the average growing period for crops is less than 200 days. Agricultural labor accounts for less than 4% of the national workforce, yet it can stably meet the market demand for agricultural products. They believe that while there are many reasons for this, the role of agricultural cooperatives in management and operations cannot be underestimated.

    瑞典的农业合作社
    本报记者　顾耀铭
    在瑞典，一个农民或农场主通常同时加入几个农业专业合作社。这些合作社在经营管理方面有自己的特色，各种合作社之间的协作较好。
    我们在隆德附近访问的本·约翰松就是五个合作社的成员。他每天挤获的牛奶由当地奶制品合作社收运加工，饲养的肉牛交给肉类合作社屠宰定级，生产的粮食送往粮食销售合作社，把采伐的木材堆在路边，由林业主合作社运往木材加工厂。他把所得收入大部分存入农业合作社银行。
    约翰松领我们在他的农场转了一大圈。他有37公顷耕地，其中12公顷是租用邻居家的。这些土地主要用于种植小麦、燕麦和牧草，还种一些冬小麦。牲畜棚里有30头奶牛、22头肉牛和11头小奶牛。约翰松还有60公顷的森林。除农忙和砍伐树木时少量雇工外，大部分农活都是靠他和妻子奥林亲自干。农闲时，他们还到外面找工作补充收入。这个农场称算得上中等规模，在瑞典现有10万个农场中近50％差不多这么大小。
    他介绍，瑞典的农业合作社最早是以播种和收割队的形式出现，互相帮工，从30年代后有了大规模的发展。目前各地的农业合作社有600多个，按专业可分15种类型，90％以上的农民、农场主加入了合作社。瑞典市场约75％的农产品来自合作社。
    我们请约翰松介绍一下合作社的组织情况。他说，农业合作社在自愿加入、民主管理等方面同其它合作社相似，所不同的是合作社与农场在经济上是独立核算的，属于农场活动的开支一律由农场主负担，彼此不存在领导与被领导的关系，因此一个农民、农场主可以同时加入几个不同专业的合作社。约翰松必须向他所属的各个合作社交纳股金，股金的多少是根据他向合作社出售农产品的数量而定。合作社经营中的赢利除留部分作发展基金外，部分按股金分成，其余部分以较低价格提供生产资料的方式给社员。合作社不允许让一部分社员从另一部分社员中得利。约翰松每年同合作社有生产协议，他必须把生产的所有产品交给所属专业合作社，而合作社必须全部收购。
    农民或农场主加入合作社可以得到哪些好处？约翰松谈到，合作社首先帮助他解决了产品的加工、销售，因为合作社有自己的加工企业，同消费合作社、超级市场等建立了固定的供销关系，因此销路有保证，而且能得到比较好的价格。他还能以低价从合作社得到良种、肥料、饲料和机械。他们家需要的奶酪、黄油等食品也是以便宜价从合作社购入。合作社还帮助他得到市场和技术信息，同他一起商订生产计划，避免生产过剩，尽可能多生产市场需要的产品。此外，合作社提供农机修理、兽医等服务。
    约翰松指出，合作社在稳定市场农产品价格方面也发挥了很大作用。各地农业合作社和农业工会联合组成了全国农民协会。按照瑞典议会通过的法案，农产品的市场价格要由农民协会、消费者协会和政府三方协商决定，使价格既不能超出消费者所能接受的水平，也要保证农场的收入。
    瑞典朋友告诉我们，瑞典的可耕地只占全部土地的1／10，作物平均生长期不到200天，农业劳动力占全国劳力不到4％，却可稳定保证市场对农产品需求。他们认为其中原因虽多，但农业合作社在经营管理方面所起作用不可低估。
