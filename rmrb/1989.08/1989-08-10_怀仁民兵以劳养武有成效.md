The People's Daily reports that Shanxi Province's Huairen County has incorporated the work of the county's military affairs department into the overall local work framework, making commendable attempts to explore new paths for militia construction in the new situation.

The county committee and the military affairs department, starting from the characteristics of the dynamic combination of rural labor, have established a militia force that adapts to the forms of rural production and operation. In addition to establishing militia organizations in 38% of township enterprises, they have also implemented the class and platoon structures of the militia in groups such as transportation and breeding.

To solve the financial difficulties of militia activities, the county committee strongly supports the establishment of economic entities by militia organizations and has formulated preferential measures such as priority loans, priority leases, and priority contracts. Currently, the county has established 27 economic entities with the militia as the main body, achieving an annual profit of over 70,000 yuan. Some township and village militia activity funds are basically self-sufficient, paving a new path of "combining labor and military training."

    怀仁民兵以劳养武有成效
    本报讯　山西怀仁县把人武部工作纳入地方整体工作的轨道，在探索新形势下民兵建设的新途径上作出可喜尝试。
  县委和人武部从农村劳力动态组合的特点出发，建立与农村生产经营形式相适应的民兵队伍。除在38％的乡镇企业中建立民兵组织外，还把民兵的部分班、排建制落实在运输、养殖等行业群体中。
    为解决民兵活动的资金困难，县委大力支持民兵组织兴办经济实体，并制定了优先贷款、优先租赁、优先承包等优惠措施。目前，全县已兴办以民兵为主体的经济实体27个，每年实现利润7万多元。部分乡村民兵活动经费基本自给，走出一条“以劳养武”的新路。
