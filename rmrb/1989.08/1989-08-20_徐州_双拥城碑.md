The "Double Support City" Stele is located in the Chóngwén Flower Garden on Huáihǎi East Road in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. The stele is adorned with three large characters, "Double Support City," personally inscribed by Marshal Xu Xiangqian.

The "Double Support City" Stele consists of a main stele and a recumbent stele, with a circular stele pond beneath them.

The base of the main stele is made of reinforced concrete, and the surface of the stele seat is inlaid with deep green granite slabs. The stele body is 16.9 meters high, golden yellow in color, and composed of two stele bodies, symbolizing the unbreakable relationship between the military and the people.

The recumbent stele stands in front of the main stele, measuring 1.8 meters high and 1.5 meters wide, made of granite. The front of the stele is inscribed with the "Double Support City" Stele Inscription, which praises the military and civilians of Xuzhou:

Xuzhou, an ancient city, has long been a strategic stronghold and a key to both the northern and southern regions. During the Huaihai Campaign, the People's Liberation Army fought bravely, and millions of people supported the frontline, sharing life and death together, with a deep bond like fish and water. With the rise of the five-starred red flag, forty years have passed. The story has been passed down through three generations, and the people of Xuzhou still support the military and care for their families. The stationed troops, despite changes, have always been a force that supports the government and loves the people. The city and countryside residents treat soldiers as their own children, doing practical things for the stationed troops in Xuzhou and helping local military personnel. Soldiers strive to excel in battle, and news of their achievements frequently arrives. The stationed troops regard Xuzhou as their second hometown, bravely rescuing people in disasters, assisting local projects, beautifying the ancient land, and jointly building a civilized society. They have sweated over the mountains and rivers, setting a good example for future generations. The double support spirit blossoms, competing with the spring of Huaihai, with military and political harmony promoting each other. The spirit of supporting the military spreads throughout the countryside, and the reputation of loving the people fills the military camps. To commend the achievements of Xuzhou's military and civilians in double support, the title of "Double Support City" is conferred upon Xuzhou, and this stele is erected to praise the new spirit.

The stele pond is circular, with a diameter of 16 meters and a depth of 1.5 meters. The water is clear, and fish can be seen swimming. This symbolizes the inseparable bond between the military and the people. There is a fountain in the pond, symbolizing the unity and enthusiasm of the military and the people. Around the stele pond, there are lush evergreen trees, symbolizing the everlasting friendship between the military and the people.

    朱信忠
    “双拥城碑”坐落在苏北徐州市淮海东路崇文花园内。碑的南北两面镶嵌着徐向前元帅亲笔题写的“双拥城”三个大字。
    “双拥城碑”由主碑、卧碑两部分组成，下面另有一圆形碑池。
    主碑碑基为钢筋混凝土浇铸的整体结构；碑座面层镶贴深绿色花岗岩石板；碑体高16.9米，金黄色，由两块碑体凝聚而成，象征军民关系坚如磐石。
    卧碑立在主碑前侧，高1.8米，宽1.5米，花岗岩制成，正面镌刻褒扬徐州军民的《双拥城碑文》：
    古城徐州，向为北国门户，南国锁钥，屯戍要塞，膏腴之地。淮海战役中，人民解放军浴血征战，数百万人民全力支前，生死与共，鱼水情深。五星升起，四十春秋。人传三代，依然拥军优属之民；驻军数易，均是拥政爱民之师。城乡百姓待军人若子弟，既为驻徐部队办实事，又为本籍军人纾忧难；志士从戎争先，立功喜讯频传。驻徐部队视徐州为第二故乡，奋勇抢险救灾，力助地方工程，美化古彭大地，共建两个文明，汗洒云龙山水，嘉行垂范后人。双拥花开，争春淮海，军政和谐，竞相促进，拥军新风遍乡里，爱民美誉满军营。为褒扬徐州军民双拥成绩，决定授予徐州市双拥城称号，并立碑志文，以彰新风。
    碑池为圆形，直径16米，深1.5米，池水清澈见底，游鱼可见。喻军民鱼水之情不可分。池中有喷水装置，象征军民团结、奋发向上的激情。碑池的四周有生长旺盛的四季长青林带，象征着军民友谊四季长青。
