	Chinese Chess in the UK
	Xinhua News Agency, London, August 7 (Reporter Zhang Mingde) About a decade ago, when M. Zantre was studying for his Ph.D. in chemistry at Newcastle University in the UK, he was a member of the university's international chess team. By chance, he encountered Chinese chess and was immediately captivated by its profound Eastern wisdom and intricate strategies. From then on, he bid farewell to the black-and-white 64-square chessboard and devoted himself to the battlefield between the Chu and Han rivers.

	Several years later, Dr. Zantre moved to London and met some Chinese chess enthusiasts, forming friendships over the game. In 1986, under Zantre's initiative, the first Chinese chess association in British history was established, and Zantre was elected as its chairman. The association now has over 30 members. In 1987, Zantre led the British team to participate in the "Qixing Cup" chess tournament held in Chengdu. The following year, the fifth European Chinese Chess Championship was held in London. This year in August, the British Chess Association hosted the first "Hong Kong Telecommunications Cup" open chess championship. To prepare and organize these activities, Dr. Zantre has been tirelessly working, saying that currently, countries like the UK, France, and West Germany have established chess associations. His next goal is to plan the establishment of the European Chess Federation to further promote the development of this sport in Europe.

	Dr. Zantre believes that compared to international chess, Chinese chess is more dynamic and aggressive, thus possessing a unique charm. He said that he and other members of the association will continue to promote Chinese chess in the UK, so that more British people can understand and appreciate this sport. Zantre's wish has already begun to bear fruit in his son Michael. Michael is 7 years old this year. He started learning chess two years ago and now has a good grasp of the game. In 1988, he won the youth division championship at the fifth European Chess Championship; this year in the UK, he won the championship in the under-10 age group and tied for first place in the under-18 group. In this year's "Hong Kong Telecommunications Cup" tournament, he again won the youth championship. When asked what his favorite sport is, he replied without hesitation: "Chinese chess!" He believes that Chinese chess will have new developments in Europe.

    中国象棋在英国
    新华社伦敦8月7日电　（记者张明德）十几年前，马·赞特莱在英国的纽卡斯尔大学攻读化学博士时，是学校国际象棋队的成员。一次偶然的机会，他接触到了中国象棋，立即被那饱含着东方智慧的种种奥妙强烈地吸引住了。从此，他告别了黑白相间的64格棋盘，专心致志地驰骋于楚河汉界的大地之间。
    几年后，赞特莱博士来到伦敦，结识了一些中国象棋爱好者，以棋会友，其乐融融。1986年，在赞特莱的倡导下，英国有史以来的第一个象棋协会诞生了，赞特莱被推举为主席。现在，该协会共拥有30余名会员。1987年，赞特莱率英国队参加了在成都举行的“七星杯”象棋赛。翌年，在伦敦举办了第五届欧洲象棋锦标赛。今年8月，英国象棋协会又主办了首届“香港电讯杯”象棋公开锦标赛。为筹备、组织这些活动，赞特莱博士忙前跑后，不遗余力。他说，目前英国、法国、联邦德国等都成立了象棋协会，他的下一个目标是，筹划成立欧洲象棋联合会，以促进这一运动在欧洲的进一步开展。
    赞特莱博士认为，和国际象棋相比，中国象棋更富于动感和攻击性，因而具有独特的吸引力。他说，他与协会的其他成员将不断致力于中国象棋在英国的推广，使更多的英国人了解并喜爱这一运动。赞特莱的这一愿望已经在他的儿子迈克尔身上初见成效。迈克尔今年7岁，他两年前随父学弈，现在行棋布阵已颇有几分模样。1988年，他在第五届欧洲象棋赛上获得少年组冠军；今年在英国又夺得10岁以下年龄组冠军；同时并列18岁以下级第一名。他在本届“香港电讯杯”赛上又获少年冠军。记者问他最喜欢的运动是什么，他毫不含糊地答道：“中国象棋！”他认为中国象棋在欧洲将会有新的发展。
