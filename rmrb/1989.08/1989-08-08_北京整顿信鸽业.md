Beijing is cracking down on pigeon fancying. According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th, the Beijing Pigeon Fancying Association has begun to rectify the conduct of its 15,000 members.

The association, established seven years ago, has made certain contributions to the development of pigeon fancying. However, currently, some members and pigeon enthusiasts do not clean their pigeon coops regularly, causing foul odors that have aroused public discontent. Additionally, some individuals have built pigeon coops haphazardly, occupying public land. The Beijing Pigeon Fancying Association recently held a meeting and decided that members who do not adhere to the member code of conduct and the association's charter, do not participate in pigeon racing, and do not actively participate in voluntary pigeon releases will have their memberships revoked. The meeting also decided that illegally constructed pigeon coops must be demolished.

    北京整顿信鸽业
    据新华社北京8月8日电  （通讯员李春生）北京市信鸽协会日前开始对15000名会员进行整顿。
    这个协会成立七年来，为信鸽事业的发展做出一定贡献。可是目前一些会员和信鸽爱好者的鸽舍不常打扫，臭气熏天，引起群众不满；还有的人乱建鸽舍，挤占公共用地。北京市信鸽协会最近召开会议决定，凡是不遵守会员守则和信鸽协会章程，不参加信鸽竞翔，不积极参加义务放飞信鸽者，一律吊销会员证。会议还决定，违章搭建的鸽舍，必须拆除。
