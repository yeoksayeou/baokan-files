Commercial Department Information Center recently provided materials indicating that in the first half of this year, the sales of large durable consumer goods across the country showed a significant downward trend, and rural markets were more sluggish than in previous years.

Statistics show that in the first half of the year, the sales of sewing machines decreased by 24.6% compared to the same period last year, bicycles by 13.2%, televisions by 16.4%, tape recorders by 10.8%, electric fans by 15.2%, washing machines by 24.1%, and refrigerators by 9.2%.

Due to the state's reduction in the scale of construction projects, the return of migrant workers to their hometowns, as well as natural disasters in some regions and the poor performance of some township enterprises, farmers' income growth has slowed, making rural markets more sluggish than in previous years. For example, in Jiangsu Province, farmers' average cash income in the first quarter was 259.24 yuan, an increase of 16.7% over the same period last year, which is 11 percentage points lower than the growth rate of the same period last year. Therefore, from January to May this year, the province's rural retail sales of commodities only increased by 17.3% compared to the same period last year, while the growth rate of commodity retail sales in urban areas (including county towns) was more than 26% during the same period.

    上半年各地市场信息：
    大件消费品销势回落  农村市场比往年清淡
    本报北京8月12日讯　商业部信息中心日前提供的材料表明：今年上半年，全国市场大件耐用消费品出现大幅度回落趋势，农村市场则显得比往年清淡。
    据统计，上半年，缝纫机销售比去年同期回落24.6％，自行车回落13.2％，电视机回落16.4％，录音机回落10.8％，电风扇回落15.2％，洗衣机回落24.1％，电冰箱回落9.2％。
    由于国家压缩基建规模，外出做工农民陆续回乡，再加上部分地区遭受自然灾害，以及部分乡镇企业生产经营不景气等原因，农民收入增幅降低，农村市场比往年清淡。如江苏省农民一季度现金人均收入259.24元，比去年同期增长16.7％，增幅低于去年同期11个百分点。因此，今年1至5月，该省农村商品零售额只比去年同期增长17.3％，而同期城市（包括县城）商品零售额增长幅度却在26％以上。
