	“I Only Act According to the Law”
	—Recording the Incident of Zhang Duo Refusing Bribes at the Datong Railway Transportation Procuratorate

	Zhang Duo, the procurator of the Datong Railway Transportation Procuratorate in Shanxi, is renowned for his adherence to the law.

	One year ago, the Datong Railway Transportation Procuratorate accepted two major economic crime cases involving embezzlement, bribery, and bribe-giving from the Datong Railway Signal and Power Supply Sections. Among the 15 suspects, who were officials, some were former subordinates of Zhang Duo, and some had old relationships with him. When the procuratorate was about to handle these two cases, three relatives of the suspects sought Zhang Duo to plead for leniency and offered him expensive gifts. One person, seeing that Zhang Duo’s furniture was old, bluntly said, “If you can exempt Li from punishment or give him a suspended sentence, I will give you a set of combined furniture.” Zhang Duo replied frankly, “Those who came to plead for them include people who have committed bribery and bribe-giving crimes. If you bribe them again, isn’t that violating the law?” Zhang Duo’s words deeply educated the person who came to plead.

	This embezzlement and bribery case involved joint criminal acts. Due to the different attitudes of the suspects towards confessing, the investigation faced some difficulties. One of the suspects, Li Linshan, had a good attitude towards confessing and played an important role in clarifying the entire case. Based on this, the procuratorate, in accordance with the law, treated him leniently and decided not to prosecute. Li Linshan and his wife went around asking about Zhang Duo’s home and insisted on visiting to express their gratitude. Zhang Duo knew about this and told them, “If you come to my home to express gratitude, you are wrong. It was not Zhang Duo who decided to exempt you from prosecution, but the state’s laws and the party’s policies. I only act according to the law.”

	The thief Guo, who stole public property worth 1100 yuan, was sentenced to two years in prison. After the court’s verdict, some spectators commented, “Guo and Zhang Duo, the procurator, are relatives, yet he didn’t show any favoritism.” “Guo and the procurator are relatives, how come we didn’t know?” The procuratorate’s staff were puzzled. It turned out that Guo was a distant relative of the procurator. Before Guo was arrested, his relatives went to Zhang Duo’s home to ask the procurator to do something. Zhang Duo did not agree. Later, his relatives brought heavy gifts of cigarettes and alcohol and asked Zhang Duo again, “For the sake of our relationship, please do something to keep his job.” Zhang Duo said earnestly, “The more we are related, the less we should show favoritism. Today, if you are visiting as relatives and bringing me gifts, I will accept them, but if you are bribing me for Guo, I will not accept a single cent.”

    “我只依法办事”
    ——记大同铁路运输检察院张垛拒贿事迹
    山西大同铁路运输检察院检察长张垛依法办事，被传为佳话。
    一年前，大同铁路运输检察院受理了大同铁路电务段和水电段的两起贪污、受贿、行贿重大经济犯罪案件，案犯有15名是干部，他们中有的曾是张垛的老部下，有的同他有老关系。检察院正着手审理这两起案件时，3名案犯的亲属便托人找张垛说情，并表示馈赠贵重礼物。有一人见张垛家的家具已旧，单刀直入地说：“如果能给案犯李某某免罚或判个缓刑，送您一套组合家具。”张垛直言不讳地说：“你来替他们说情的这些人，其中有的就犯有受贿、行贿罪，如果你再替他们行贿，不就是知法犯法吗？”张垛的衷告，使前来说情人深受教育。
    这起贪污、受贿案，属共同犯罪。由于案犯的认罪态度不同，给侦查工作带来了一定难度。案犯之一的李林山在审理中认罪态度好，并对查清整个案件的犯罪事实起了重要作用。据此检察院依法对他从宽处理，予以免予起诉。李林山和老伴四处打听张垛的家，非要登门拜谢。张垛知道后对他们说：“你们要去我家感谢就错了。不是我张垛决定对你免诉，而是国家的法律和党的政策有规定，我只依法办事”。
    盗窃犯郭某某，因盗窃价值1100元的公共财物被判处有期徒刑二年。法庭宣判后旁听群众有人议论，“郭××和张垛检察长还沾亲呢，一点也没照顾。”“郭××和检察长沾亲，我们怎么一点也不知道？”检察院的办案人员感到纳闷。原来郭××是检察长的一门远亲，郭还未被逮捕时，其亲属就到张垛家求检察长想点办法，张垛没答应。后来其亲属又拿上烟酒等重礼，再次求张垛：“看在沾亲带故的份上，想办法给留个饭碗。”张垛语重心长地说：“越是沾亲带故，越不能徇私情。今天你如果是走亲戚给我带点礼物，那我收下，但你是为郭××说情送礼，因而一分钱的东西我也不收。”
