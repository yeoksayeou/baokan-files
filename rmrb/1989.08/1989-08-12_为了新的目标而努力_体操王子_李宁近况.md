Retired Chinese gymnastics champion Li Ning recently called on people from all walks of life in Beijing to show concern for the 11th Asian Games and contribute to the success of this globally watched sporting event.

This renowned athlete, known as the "Prince of Gymnastics" by the international sports community, has participated in numerous major international competitions, including two Olympic Games, two Asian Games, and two World University Games. He said that every time a sports event is held, it promotes various aspects of the host country, whether it be the economy or culture, and provides an excellent opportunity to showcase the national spirit.

Li Ning said that hosting the Asian Games is a first in Chinese history, and Chinese people should be proud of this. Despite the fact that many people still have various objections to hosting the Asian Games, he remains confident. He believes that the Asian Games will definitely be a success, and that the Chinese people have the capability to do so.

Li Ning believes that some people currently have a shallow understanding of hosting the Asian Games, only seeing the surface and the expenditure. In fact, they have not seen the other side of the matter. Through the Asian Games, the world will have a new understanding and recognition of Chinese culture and the spirit of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people themselves will have a new understanding of various aspects of their motherland.

As a seasoned athlete, Li Ning's ambition is not only to win the world gymnastics championship but also to hope that one day his motherland can host large-scale international events like the Asian Games and the Olympics, showcasing the prowess of a sports powerhouse. Now that this long-cherished wish is about to come true, how can he not be thrilled? Whether he goes north to Beijing or south to Guangdong, or wherever his footsteps take him, he talks to everyone about the significance of hosting the Asian Games and encourages colleagues and friends to support the preparations for the Asian Games whenever he gets the chance. As the first and only Asian representative on the International Olympic Committee Athletes' Commission, he is fully utilizing his influence to seek support and assistance from various international sports organizations for the 11th Asian Games.

    为了新的目标而努力
    ——“体操王子”李宁近况
    已退役的我国体操名将李宁日前在北京呼吁，全国各界人士都来关心第十一届亚运会，为办好这一世界瞩目的运动会出力。
    这位被世界体育界誉为“体操王子”的著名运动员，曾参加过数十次重大的国际比赛，其中包括两次奥运会、两次亚运会和两次世界大学生运动会。他说，每次运动会的举行，都对主办国的各方面起到促进作用，无论是经济，还是文化，促进作用都很大，而且还是各国民族精神发扬光大的好机会。
    李宁说，举办亚运会，这在中国历史上是第一次，中国人应该为此而感到骄傲。尽管现在还有许多人对举办亚运会有种种非议，但他对亚运会仍抱有信心。他相信亚运会一定能办好，中国人是有这个能力的。
    李宁认为，现在一些人对举办亚运会认识不深，仅仅看到表面，看到花钱。其实，他们没有看到事情的另一面。通过亚运会，全世界都会对中国的文化、中国人的精神风貌，以至对中国有新的了解和认识，中国人自己也会对祖国的各方面有更新的认识。
    作为一名久经沙场的运动员，李宁的夙愿不仅想摘取世界体操冠军的桂冠，而且希望有朝一日自己的祖国能承办像亚运会、奥运会这样大型的国际赛事，一展体育大国的雄姿。如今，这个梦寐以求的愿望已经快要实现，他怎么能不激动万分呢。他不论是北上京城，还是南下广东，以至足迹所到之处，逢人就讲举办亚运会的意义，一有机会就鼓励同事和朋友支持亚运会的筹备工作。作为国际奥委会运动员委员会第一位也是唯一的亚洲代表，他充分运用自己的影响，为得到一些国际体育组织对第十一届亚运会的支持和帮助而正奔走游说。
