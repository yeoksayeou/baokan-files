During the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, people have felt that addressing corruption and regaining the trust of the people is a major task that must be tackled. On this issue, I believe that as a Communist Party member and cadre, it is necessary to consciously compare oneself against the Party member standards, conduct a self-criticism, and calmly reflect on one's past, seriously considering one's future.

In the previous study sessions, when discussing the issue of corruption, some Party members and cadres often saw themselves as "outsiders" or "spectators," criticizing others while ignoring their own problems. Indeed, Party members have the responsibility to give suggestions to leaders and point out problems, but at the same time, they should also see that some of their own problems cannot be ignored. The Party organization focusing on building the Party is indeed very important, but each Party member consciously maintaining integrity and uprightness is equally important. The collective image of the Party is inseparable from the individual image of Party members. Addressing corruption and regaining the trust of the people requires the joint efforts of the entire Party.

Over a period of time, some comrades have not emphasized Party principles and have abandoned the Party's fine traditions. Some Party members, despite not holding leadership positions, have used their limited authority to seek personal gain, and even accepted bribes, leading to corruption and degeneration. Although such Party members are few in number, their influence is very bad, damaging the Party's image and causing harm to the Party's cause. Reflecting on the past, these comrades should bravely come forward to admit and correct their mistakes. If they think they can get away with it, they will only compound their errors, and the result will be that "the clever will be outsmarted by their own cleverness," falling deeper and harder.

Some comrades say, "I have not embezzled or accepted bribes, and I have a clear conscience." We say that being law-abiding and honest is only the most basic behavioral standard. As a Party member, this is far from enough. Even if one has indeed maintained "two clean hands," it is still necessary to ask oneself, "Have I maintained 'one upright spirit'?" Communist Party members should use their upright spirit to resolutely fight against all corrupt behavior. This is also what Party members should do. However, some comrades, in the face of corruption, fear confrontation, fear being cursed at, and fear retaliation. They clearly dislike corruption but choose to be "good-natured" instead. This is also wrong.

In reality, there are indeed many Party members and cadres who strictly demand of themselves, remain untainted, and resolutely resist corruption. We hope these Party members will seriously summarize their experiences, further firm up their convictions, and continue to sing the "song of integrity" and the "song of uprightness."

In summary, regardless of the type of Party member, it is necessary to seriously reflect on one's past and future. This is not about "everyone passing inspection," but about summarizing experiences, raising awareness, finding shortcomings, clarifying directions, and better playing the role of Party members as vanguards and models.

    党员都应想想“我”的过去与未来
    郭登明　凌焕新
    在学习邓小平同志讲话过程中，人们感到，整治腐败、取信于民是一件大事，一定要抓好。在这个问题上，我认为，作为一个共产党员和党员干部，也有必要自觉对照党员标准，开展一次批评和自我批评，冷静地回顾一下自己的过去，认真地考虑一下自己的未来。
    前一段学习中，议及腐败问题，一些党员和党员干部，往往把自己当成“局外人”、“旁观者”，对上议论纷纷，对己高高挂起。诚然，党员有责任给领导提意见，找问题，但同时还应该看到，一些党员的自身的问题也不容忽视。党组织聚精会神抓党的建设，固然十分重要，每个党员自觉坚持清正廉洁、一身正气，也一样不可忽视。党的集体形象同党员的个体形象是分不开的。整治腐败，取信于民，离不开全党上下的共同努力。
    一个时期以来，一些同志不大讲党性，把党的优良传统丢掉了。有的党员尽管不担任领导职务，也利用自己掌管的一点点权力谋取私利，甚至受贿索贿，腐化堕落。这样的党员虽然为数不多，但影响极坏，损害了党的形象，给党的事业造成了损失。反思过去，这些同志应该勇敢地站出来承认错误，改正错误，如果自以为可以蒙混过关，那就错上加错，其结果只会“聪明反被聪明误”，跌得更深，摔得更惨。
    有的同志说，我没有贪污受贿当倒爷，问心无愧。我们说，安分守己，遵纪守法，只是最起码的行为准则。作为党员，远不能满足于此。即使确确实实做到了“两袖清风”，也还有必要问一问自己，有没有做到“一身正气”。共产党员要以自己的耿耿正气，与一切腐败行为作坚决斗争，这也是党员应该做到的。然而，有些同志在腐败面前，怕撕破脸皮，怕跳脚骂娘，怕打击报复，明明对腐败看不惯，却甘当“好好先生”。这也是不对的。
    现实生活中，确有不少党员和党员干部，对自己严格要求，一尘不染；对腐败现象坚决抵制，一身是胆。人们希望这些党员认真地总结一下经验，进一步坚定自己的信念，唱好“清廉曲”、“正气歌”。
    总之，无论是哪一种类型的党员，都有必要对自己的过去与未来进行一番认真的思考。这不是“人人过关”，而是总结经验，提高认识，找出不足，明确方向，更好地发挥党员的先锋模范作用。
