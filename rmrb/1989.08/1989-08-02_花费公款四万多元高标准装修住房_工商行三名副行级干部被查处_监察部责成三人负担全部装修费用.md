Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 2nd.

Three vice-director level (equivalent to deputy minister level) officials of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have been disciplined for using over 40,000 yuan of public funds to renovate their homes at a high standard. The State Supervision Bureau has ordered the three individuals to bear the full cost of the renovations.

According to a report by reporter Shū Yú from Beijing on August 2nd, the State Supervision Bureau recently investigated and dealt with a case of disciplinary violations at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Three vice-director level officials who spent over 40,000 yuan of public funds to renovate their homes at a high standard have been disciplined.

At the beginning of last year, three vice-director level officials of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China each received new homes. One of them received two apartments totaling six rooms, while the other two each received three apartments totaling six rooms. Despite having spacious new homes, they still sought luxury and extravagance.

According to the relevant regulations of the State Council, only officials at the vice-minister level and above are allowed to use public funds to renovate their homes to a certain standard. The three vice-director level officials of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ignored this regulation. In January of last year, with the approval of Vice President Huang Yuzhun, the bank first renovated the home of one vice-director level official by wallpapering and installing seven expensive aluminum alloy windows, costing over 12,000 yuan.

In September of last year, the other two vice-director level officials' new homes were renovated. Not only were the walls of all the rooms, hallways, and corridors wallpapered, and hanging lines installed, but the floors were also tiled. The rooms were equipped with heating covers and curtain boxes. The kitchens and bathrooms were tiled, and floor tiles or mosaics were laid. Mirror cabinets were also installed. The average renovation cost per household was over 14,300 yuan.

The State Supervision Bureau deemed that the three officials of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China spending tens of thousands of yuan of public funds to renovate their personal homes was a violation of discipline and an act of extravagance and waste. It was decided to give Huang Yuzhun, the vice president who bears the main leadership responsibility for the home renovations, a demerit; to give Wang Zhuxiang, the vice president who is directly responsible for the home renovations, a warning; and to have the bank deal with other related responsible parties. Additionally, Huang Yuzhun and the other two officials were ordered to bear the full cost of the renovations to their personal homes.

    花费公款四万多元高标准装修住房
    工商行三名副行级干部被查处
    监察部责成三人负担全部装修费用
    本报北京8月2日讯　记者舒瑜报道：国家监察部近日查处了中国工商银行一起违纪案。3名用4万余元公款高标准装修住房的副行级（正厅级）干部，分别受到处理。
    去年初，中国工商银行3名副行级领导干部分得了新房，其中1人分得两套共6居室，另两人各分得3套共6居室。他们有了宽敞的新住房后，得陇望蜀，还要追求奢侈豪华。
    根据国务院有关规定，只有副部级以上干部才能用公款按一定标准装修住房。中国工商银行的这3名副行级（正厅级）干部对此置若罔闻。去年1月，经该行副行长黄玉峻同志批准，该行先为一名副行级领导干部的住房加贴了壁纸，并安装了7个价格昂贵的铝合金窗，耗资12000余元。
    去年9月，该行的另两名副行级干部的新房接着装修。不仅所有居室、门厅及过道的墙面都贴了壁纸，安装了挂镜线，地面均铺上地板块，居室内还加装了暖气罩和窗帘盒，厨房和卫生间里都贴上瓷砖，铺了地面砖或马赛克，装了镜箱等。平均每户装修费用14300余元。
    监察部认为，中国工商银行三名领导干部花费数万元公款装修自家住房，是违反政纪、奢侈浪费的行为。决定给予对装修住房负有主要领导责任的副行长黄玉峻同志行政记过处分；给予主管行政工作、对装修住房负有直接责任的副行长王占祥同志行政警告处分；其他有关责任者由工商银行另行处理。此外，责成黄玉峻等3位领导干部负担装修本人住房的全部费用。
