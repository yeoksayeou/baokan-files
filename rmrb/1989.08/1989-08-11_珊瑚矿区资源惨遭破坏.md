The Coral Mine is a major base for the export of tin and tungsten products in Guangxi. The refined tin ingots produced here are sold to various countries in Europe and America. Over the past two years, many locals have rushed into the mine, engaging in chaotic and illegal mining activities, looting, and stealing, which has disrupted the management order of the mine area and caused severe damage to the country's mineral resources. In the hills surrounding the Coral Mine area, numerous private mining sites have sprung up, far exceeding the limits set by the government, and competing with state-owned mining enterprises for the same mineral veins. Some have blown up passages connecting private mining sites with state-operated tunnels, leading to looting of tin and tungsten ore in state-owned mining sites. For example, since May last year, more than 10 tunnels in the 75th section of the 59th mining site have been blown up, causing a major collapse in the entire mining site, which has not yet been restored to production.

Some private mining sites, after connecting with state-operated tunnels, have allowed criminals to enter state-owned mining sites to steal and loot semi-finished ore, causing the country to lose at least tens of millions of yuan annually. According to statistics, last year, the public security and mine protection teams in the Coral Mine area apprehended more than 1,000 criminals involved in looting and stealing state-owned mineral products. Some people often sneak into mine shafts using ropes and ladders, descending tens to hundreds of meters to steal ore, resulting in many deaths or severe injuries.

Relevant departments should take measures to stop the trend of damaging the country's mineral resources.

    珊瑚矿区资源惨遭破坏
    珊瑚矿是广西主要的锡钨产品的出口基地。生产的精锡锭远销欧美各国。近两年来，这个矿区周围的不少群众纷纷涌入矿山，乱挖滥采，哄抢盗窃，扰乱了矿区的管理秩序，使国家矿产资源遭到严重破坏。在珊瑚矿区周围山头上，民间矿点星罗棋布，大大超越了政府规定的界限，并与国家矿山企业争挖同一矿脉。有的将民间矿点通道与国家开采的巷道炸通，到国营采矿场哄抢锡钨矿砂。例如，75中段59采矿场去年5月以来，有10多条巷道先后被炸塌，引起了整个采矿场大塌方，至今无法恢复生产。
    有的民间矿点与国家采矿场的巷道打通后，不法分子进入国家采场盗窃哄抢半成品矿砂，使国家每年至少损失上百万元。据统计，去年，珊瑚矿区公安机关和护矿队就抓获哄抢偷盗国家矿产品的不法分子1000多人。有的人常常摸黑用绳索、软梯爬下几十米、上百米深的矿井偷矿砂，不少人枉送性命或者摔伤致残。
    有关部门应采取措施，刹住破坏国家矿产资源的歪风。
