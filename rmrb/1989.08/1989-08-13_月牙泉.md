		Should the Crescent Spring be developed?

		As soon as I stepped into the Dunhuang County Guesthouse, I saw a notice on the window of the registration desk calling for donations to develop the famous Crescent Spring. Upon closer inspection, the notice stated that this rare spring in the Gobi Desert was facing extinction due to excessive siltation and damaged buildings. The relevant authorities were appealing for assistance to save it. Beside the window, there was a list of donations from various visitors. Notably, Japanese friends had contributed the most, but I can't recall the details of the others.

		This time, I came to Dunhuang with the intention of visiting the Crescent Spring. Seeing the notice, I decided to go the next afternoon.

		On the way to the Crescent Spring, we passed by the Singing Sand Mountain. Standing at the peak, I could see the shimmering spring water in the distance. After climbing the sand dunes, my feet were scorched by the hot sand, and my mouth was parched. Seeing the clear spring water, I felt like I had emerged from the clouds to see the sun, overjoyed and exhilarated. This experience alone was enough to understand why the locals call this spring the "miracle spring."

		The Crescent Spring is also known as the "miracle spring" for another reason: the desert dunes are constantly shifting with the wind, but after thousands of years, the Crescent Spring has not been buried by the sand. This is a rare phenomenon in the desert!

		As I approached the spring, I cupped my hands and drank the water. The water was so clear that I could see the bottom. A few reeds swayed gently, and a sense of coolness enveloped me. Even more miraculous was that the spring water, which has flowed for thousands of years, is home to small fish swimming and playing. It's hard to understand how fish can thrive in such shallow water. After washing up, I looked around the spring. I saw two crescent-shaped pools, with only a few old willows by the edge. Beyond that, there was nothing but endless sand, making the scene look desolate and despondent.

		According to the guide materials, in the past, the banks of the Crescent Spring were lush with trees, especially mulberry and willow trees. There were also many ancient-style buildings and pavilions on the south and east banks, creating a magnificent sight. However, during the ten years of turmoil, these structures were demolished and have not been restored since. No wonder the appeal to save the Crescent Spring has become urgent.

		The Crescent Spring is the only spring in the northwestern Gobi Desert of China. If funds can be raised or collected to develop it and restore its former glory, it would indeed be a significant achievement. I hope this can be implemented as soon as possible.

    月牙泉

    月牙泉，也需要开发?？
    刚一迈进敦煌县招待所的大门槛儿，便望见住宿登记处的窗口上粘着一张请资助开发名胜月牙泉的呼吁书。靠近细读，呼吁书的大意是：我国戈壁名胜罕见名泉，近因积淤过多，建筑又遭破坏，泉水渐少，面临被覆灭之危，有关部门呼吁各方予以援助，以期挽救云云。在窗上的一旁壁上粘有各界游人捐资的情况，上边捐资者很多，略注意些，见日本友人捐募数目最多，其余不能记忆了。
    这次来敦煌，本有一览月牙泉之意，看见这个呼吁便于第二天下午抽暇赴月牙了。
    到月牙泉经过沙鸣山，站到沙鸣上之巅远远便看见那炙热中的一片澄澄的泉水了。
    因为翻超沙山，脚被热沙烫得难耐，嘴里又干又渴，乍见清泉，真是如同拨云见日，大喜若狂，只此一点点体会，就足以证明这片戈壁上的清泉为什么附近人都称它为神泉了。
    月牙泉被称为神泉还有一事实：这片沙漠丘陵风砂常至，每逢风过，丘移沟平，可是经历千百年，月牙泉竟不被风砂淹没，这也是所有沙漠中罕见的奇观！
    奔临泉边，掬水痛饮，但见水清见底，几丛芦苇摇曳，清凉顿生！更神奇者，千年不涸之泉水中小鱼游嬉，使人想不通，如此浅水，为什么鱼类竟能繁衍至今？洗濯已毕，环视泉之四外，但见两弯新月之池，池边只有老柳数行，别无他物，荒沙无垠，确实显得败颓凄凉了。
    据导游材料，过去月牙泉岸，不仅绿树繁多，桑柳甚盛，而且南岸、东西岸，各有古式建筑、亭台多处，蔚为大观。自从十年动乱时被拆毁后，迄今无力恢复，难怪呼吁设法挽救月牙泉成为当务之急了。
    月牙泉，中国西北戈壁沙漠中唯一之泉，如果募资或集资开发，恢复往日盛况，实乃一件大事，盼望早日付诸实施。
