The professional technical title appointment system has taken a significant step forward, but after several years of trial implementation, many issues remain unresolved. How can the title system reform navigate the crossroads?

Reporter Xiao Guan Gen

Hu Ze Si, 58 years old, is currently a deputy bureau chief. He has led large-scale projects such as the "Research on the Current Situation and Strategic Countermeasures for Talent Utilization in Shanghai," which has had a significant impact nationwide. Recently, he completed the "Strategic Research and Countermeasures for Deepening the Title System Reform," serving as the project leader.

Reporter: The professional technical title appointment system is a crucial reform in talent management. It has been implemented in various regions for several years. From the feedback, the majority of intellectuals welcome this reform. It adds a professional technical title evaluation system outside of administrative leadership positions, which is beneficial for motivating enthusiasm. However, in practice, many imperfections have been discovered, mainly due to the lack of a good competitive mechanism, which has left many technical personnel dissatisfied. Is this the case?

Hu Ze Si: Yes, it is. This reform has achieved significant results, but there are also many problems. The primary issue is the full-time appointment. Due to the implementation of the "evaluation and appointment combined" system, and the fact that it can only be conducted within the closed circle of the unit, along with other restrictive factors, it is difficult to achieve selection and employment, dismissal, and resignation. As a result, it can only be a full-time appointment without competition. According to a survey of 15,000 professional technical personnel from 13 units in Shanghai that first implemented the professional technical title appointment system, only 57 people were not appointed, accounting for 0.38%.

Secondly, the phenomenon of seniority is severe. The appointment work initially faced sharp contradictions in innovation and policy implementation, as well as resolving historical legacy issues. Many unit leaders and evaluation committees had to sacrifice the principle of competition and adopt a conciliatory approach to ease tensions. In the survey, when evaluating high-level positions, 42% of the evaluation committee members considered academic qualifications or seniority as the primary factor.

Thirdly, talent mobility is difficult. Due to the control of indicators by higher authorities, in the situation of "many monks and little porridge," it is necessary to adopt a "wall policy." Coupled with the overall social environment and the lack of a social security system, mobility is very difficult. According to a survey by the Shanghai Municipal Title Reform Office of 285,263 professional technical personnel in the city's public institutions, only 5,283 people moved in the first title reform, accounting for 1.85% of the total.

Reporter: There are many conflicts in the implementation of the appointment system, and the expected effects have not been fully achieved. Can you further analyze the reasons?

Hu Ze Si: I think it can be analyzed from three aspects: theory, policy, and method.

This title system reform lacks theoretical preparation. In personnel management, there are currently two different management philosophies worldwide: one is "people-centered," emphasizing personnel management, with the core being the rank system; the other is "task-centered," emphasizing task management, with the core being the position system. These two philosophies are reflected in the management of professional technical personnel as the title system and the appointment system. China's previous title system was designed based on the rank system, while the current appointment system is based on the position system, determining positions based on tasks and personnel based on positions. China is a country that has long implemented the rank system, and suddenly switching to the position system lacks a foundation, making it difficult to achieve a one-step transition (from rank to position). Due to the lack of in-depth research and scientific verification on this theoretical issue, the appointment system deviates from the original intent of the reform. Currently, the position has evolved into a three-layer composite: the main layer is the professional technical position set according to needs, functioning as a position. There are two additional layers: one is the title layer, functioning as a qualification and title rank; the other is the salary layer, functioning as the distribution of consumption resources. Economically.

Theoretically, the relationship between evaluation and usage also needs to be resolved. The title represents the level and ability of a professional technical personnel, determined by the evaluation organization. As long as the professional technical personnel meet the corresponding title conditions, they should be evaluated for the title, which is the evaluation mechanism. The position is determined by the post, has a certain quota, has a term, and is decided by the administrative leadership on whether to appoint, which is the usage mechanism. The former is "evaluation," and the latter is "appointment." The current practice combines the two fundamentally different concepts of evaluation and usage, returning the position appointment to the original title evaluation but not fully following the principles of title evaluation, restricted by the position quota, making a considerable number of qualified professional technical personnel unable to obtain the corresponding technical titles, dampening their enthusiasm.

Secondly, the policies for implementing the appointment system are not coordinated, and related links such as talent mobility, salary system, and corresponding political system reforms have not been synchronized and coordinated, leaving the appointment system in a state of deep penetration. In the end, it has to operate along the old system's track.

The third important reason why the appointment system has not been successful is that the basic work of position classification, assessment technology, and other large-scale work it relies on has not been done well. Without position classification, the series setup lacks clear principles and standards, and the series setup is becoming more and more, with many that should not belong to the professional technical position setup range also opening series. Some series, such as the economic series, have a very vague scope. In terms of assessment, there is also a lack of a scientific assessment index system and evaluation methods, and it can only follow some of the old title evaluation practices.

Reporter: So, in further deepening and improving the title system reform, what countermeasures does your project team propose?

Hu Ze Si: The countermeasures we propose can be summarized in one sentence: implement a system where qualifications, titles, and positions coexist. To this end, we have designed three models:

In universities and research institutions, implement a system where academic titles and positions coexist. Academic titles include professor, associate professor, researcher, and associate researcher, granted by an expert group through evaluation, defense, and assessment methods to confirm their ability level, and positions are appointed by the unit's administrative leadership based on the needs of the post.

In engineering, agriculture, experiments, translation, and other series, implement a system where titles and positions coexist. Titles include senior engineer, engineer; senior agronomist, agronomist; senior experimentalist, experimentalist; senior translator, translator, etc. Granted by an expert group through evaluation, defense, and assessment methods to confirm their ability level.

In law, medicine, accounting, statistics, construction, and other series, implement a system where entry qualifications (i.e., license and certificate system) and positions coexist. Entry qualification holders are equivalent to the intermediate level, granted by a social examination organization through examination.

Reporter: What are the specific methods for implementing such a model?

Hu Ze Si: The specific method is "evaluation and appointment separation," that is, separating evaluation from usage. The so-called evaluation is that an expert group composed of an evaluation committee or a social evaluation system evaluates the qualifications and titles of professional technical personnel based on their academic qualifications, seniority, level, and ability. Qualifications and titles can accompany a person for life but are not linked to salary. The so-called appointment is that the unit's administrative leadership appoints positions based on the needs of the post. Positions have a term and are linked to salary.

Reporter: Is "evaluation and appointment separation" more suitable for China's national conditions than "evaluation and appointment combination," and thus have greater advantages?

Hu Ze Si: Yes. Our productivity level is low, and the finances are tight, and the position classification and assessment evaluation system have not been established. Therefore, implementing "evaluation and appointment separation" can better handle the contradiction between the ability, level of professional technical personnel, and the needs of the post, and balance the number of qualified personnel in various departments and units, the number of personnel needed for work posts, and the amount of increased salary that the finance can bear.

More importantly, implementing "evaluation and appointment separation" is conducive to strengthening the competitive mechanism and promoting talent mobility. The qualification and title evaluation or examination is the first competition, and the position appointment is the second competition, which can form a competitive environment and inspire professional technical personnel to strive for progress.

Reporter: But as I understand it, many professional technical personnel and unit leaders have reservations about implementing "evaluation and appointment separation." Do you think this method can work?

Hu Ze Si: I think our plan has great potential. For example, we have paid attention to policy coordination and proposed to gradually establish a qualification examination system, implement competitive appointment and contract management, establish a professional technical position classification, establish a corresponding salary system, and open a talent market. The Shanghai talent market has officially opened, which not only can store talent but also has social security, job transfer training, and vocational introduction functions, initially creating conditions for the implementation of this idea.

For example, we emphasize the need to conduct pilot projects, gain experience, gradually promote, and achieve step-by-step results. During the transition to the qualification, title, and position coexistence system, we adopt the "smooth transition" approach of new people, new methods, and old people, old methods, which will avoid unnecessary confusion of thought and work contradictions.

### 专业技术职务聘任制已迈出可喜一步，但试行几年仍有不少问题未能解决——职称改革如何走出十字路口

    专业技术职务聘任制已迈出可喜一步，但试行几年仍有不少问题未能解决——
    职称改革如何走出十字路口
    本报记者　萧关根
    胡泽思，58岁，现在是副局长巡视员。他曾主持过大型软课题《上海人才使用现状及其战略对策研究》，在全国产生了较大影响。最近完成的《深化职称制度改革的战略及其对策研究》，胡泽思是课题组长。
    记者：专业技术职务聘任制是人才管理制度的一项重要改革，在各地试行已有几年。从各方反映看，广大知识分子是欢迎这项改革的，它在行政领导职务之外增加了一个专业技术职务评价系统，有利于调动积极性。但在实践中也发现尚有许多不完善之处，主要是竞争机制未能很好建立，不少专业技术人员对此不满意，是不是这样？
    胡泽思：是这样。可以说这项改革成绩不小，问题也不少，存在的问题首先是全员聘任。由于这次聘任制实行“评聘结合”，而且只能在单位内部封闭圈中进行，加上其他制约因素，使选聘与择业，解聘与辞聘很难做到，结果只能是无竞争的全员聘任。据上海首批实行专业技术职务聘任制试制点的13个单位15000名专业技术人员调查，未聘人员仅57名，只占0.38％。
    其次是论资排辈现象严重。聘任工作一开始就面临变革求新和落实政策以及解决历史遗留问题等方面的尖锐矛盾，不少单位的领导和评委只能牺牲竞争原则，采取照顾、摆平的做法以缓和矛盾。调查中，评委会成员在分析评审高级职务首先考虑的因素时，42％的人认为只能首先考虑学历或资历。
    第三是人才流动困难。由于各单位的指标由上级直接控制，在“僧多粥少”的情况下，不得不采取“壁垒政策”，加上整个社会环境特别是社会保障制度尚未形成，流动十分困难。据上海市职改办对全市事业单位285263名专业技术人员调查，在首次职改中只流动5283人，占总数的1.85％。
    记者：聘任制实施过程中矛盾很多，没有完全达到预期效果，你能进一步分析一下原因吗？
    胡泽思：我想可以从理论、政策和方法三方面来分析。
    这次职称改革，理论准备是不足的。在人事管理上，目前世界上有两种不同的管理思想，一种是“以人为中心”，强调对人的管理，其核心是品位制即品位分类；一种是“以事为中心”，强调对事的管理，其核心是职位制即职位分类。这两种思想体现在专业技术人员管理中，就是职称制度和聘任制度。我国以往的职称制度是按品位制来设计的，目前的聘任制是以职位来考虑的，以事定岗，以岗定人。我国是一个长期实行品位分类的国家，一下子搞职位分类没有基础，在职务聘任中很难一步到位（即由品位到职位）。由于对这一理论问题没有作深入研究，缺乏科学论证，因而在聘任制实施过程中，背离了改革初衷。现在的职务事实上已演变成了三层复合体：主体层面是根据需要设置的专业技术职务，起着职位功能。还有两个附加层面，一个是职称层面，起着资格、称号的品位功能；另一个是工资层面，起着消费资源分配的经济功能。
    理论上还需要解决评价与使用的关系问题。职称代表一个专业技术人员的水平和能力，由评审组织决定。只要专业技术人员符合规定的相应职称条件，都应该给他评定职称，属评价机制。职务是由岗位来确定的，有一定限额，有任期，由行政领导决定是否聘用，属使用机制。前者的工作是“评”，后者是“聘”。现行做法把评价与使用两个根本不同的概念合在一起，将职务聘任退回到原先的职称评定，但又没有完全按职称评定的原则办，受到职务指标的限制，使相当一批有水平的专业技术人员不能获得相应的技术职称，挫伤了他们的积极性。
    其二，实施聘任制的政策不配套，与之密切相关的人才流动、工资制度等有关环节以及相应的政治体制改革都没有同步配套，聘任制处于孤军深入的境地，最后不得不沿着旧体制的轨道运行。
    聘任制没有搞好的第三个重要原因，还在于它赖以运行的职位分类、考核技术等大量的基础工作没有做好。没有进行职位分类，使系列设置缺乏明确的原则和标准，系列设置越来越多、不少本不应属于专业技术职务设置范围的也开设了系列。有些系列，如经济系列，范围十分模糊。在考核方面，也缺乏一套科学的考核指标体系和评审方法，只能沿用过去职称评定的一些做法。
    记者：那么，在进一步深化和完善职称改革方面，你们课题组提出了什么对策？
    胡泽思：我们提出的对策，用一句话来概括，就是实行资格、称号评定与职务聘任并存的制度。为此，我们设计了三种模式：
    在高校、科研单位实行学衔与职务并存。学衔设教授、副教授、研究员、副研究员，由专家集团采取评审、答辩、考核等方式确认其能力水平后授予，职务由单位行政领导根据岗位需要聘任。
    在工程、农业、实验、翻译等系列实行称号与职务并存制度。称号设高级工程师、工程师；高级农艺师、农艺师；高级实验师、实验师；高级翻译、翻译等。由专家集团采取评审、答辩、考核等方式确认其能力水平后授予。
    在律师、医生、会计、统计、建筑等系列实行起点资格（即许可证等证照制度）与职务并存制度。起点资格获得者相当于中级层次，由社会考试机构通过考试后授予。
    记者：实行这样模式的具体方法是什么？
    胡泽思：具体方法是“评聘分开”，就是把评价与使用分开。所谓评，是指由专家集团组成的评审委员会或社会评价系统，根据专业技术人员的学历、资历、水平、能力，评定任职资格和称号。资格称号可以伴随终身，但不与工资挂钩。所谓聘，就是由单位行政领导根据工作需要设置的岗位聘任职务。职务有任期，与工资挂钩。
    记者：“评聘分开”较之“评聘结合”是否更适合我国国情，从而有较大的优越性呢？
    胡泽思：是的。我们的生产力水平很低，财政拮据，职位分类、考核评价等制度尚未建立。因此，实行“评聘分开”，就能较好地处理专业技术人员的能力、水平与岗位需要之间的矛盾，处理好各部门单位中合格人员数量、工作岗位需要人数和财政可承担的增资额三者之间平衡问题。
    更重要的是，实行“评聘分开”有利于强化竞争机制，促进人才流动。资格称号评审或考试是一次竞争，聘任职务是第二次竞争，这就可以形成竞争的环境，激发专业技术人员奋发向上的精神。
    记者：但据我了解，不少专业技术人员和单位领导对实行“评聘分开”是有顾虑的。你估计这个办法能行得通吗？
    胡泽思：我认为，我们的方案颇具可能性。比如，我们注意了政策配套，提出了逐步建立资格考试制度，实行竞争聘任、合同管理，建立专业技术职位分类，建立相应的工资制度以及开放人才市场等政策。而目前上海人才市场已正式开放，它不仅能储存人才，还有社会保障、转岗培训和职业介绍等功能，给这个设想的实施初步创造了条件。
    再如，我们强调要通过试点、取得经验、逐步推开、分步到位。在向资格称号和职务并存制度过渡时，采取新人新办法、老人老办法的“平滑过渡”，这会避免不必要的思想混乱和工作矛盾。
