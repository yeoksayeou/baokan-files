The city of Dalian is brimming with the unique vitality of an open city. Walking along the bustling streets and new development zones, numerous modern-style international hotels, international exhibition centers, Silver Sail Hotel, overpasses, and other buildings come into view. Hundreds of foreign-invested enterprises are scattered throughout the various districts. Opening up has brought Dalian onto the international stage. Recently, major international economic and trade activities and academic events such as the Sino-Japanese Economic Development Seminar, the Dalian International Economic Cooperation Seminar, and the Northeast China and Inner Mongolia Export Commodities Fair have been held here, attracting tens of thousands of guests. One cooperation project after another has been realized here.

What has driven Dalian's takeoff?

Dalian has focused on strengthening the city's economic power, adopting the strategy of bringing in, going out, bringing in again, and going out again.

Dalian's opening up started three to four years later than the southern regions that were the first to open up. However, Dalian residents do not compete on speed but rather emphasize practical results. The city's leaders and a group of practical workers have focused the reform and opening up on enhancing the city's economic strength. They have concentrated their efforts on transforming old enterprises, establishing foreign-invested enterprises, developing zones, and increasing export capabilities.

Dalian has thousands of old enterprises that need technological upgrades. The municipal Party committee and government decided to first focus on transforming these old enterprises. Over the past five years, the city has spent hundreds of millions of dollars purchasing advanced technology and equipment or collaborating with foreign enterprises through various forms such as joint production and joint ventures. This has brought in over a thousand items of advanced foreign technology and equipment, transforming more than 600 enterprises. Some enterprises have seen "leapfrog" improvements.

Dalian residents suggested we take a look at some of these transformed old enterprises. Indeed, although the factory buildings of these old enterprises are not as modern as those of joint ventures, the interiors have undergone a metamorphosis. The Dalian Shipyard, with a history of 90 years, has absorbed foreign technology in recent years, raising its shipbuilding technology to the level of the 1980s. It has built dozens of new ships with the title of "national first," with export contracts exceeding $300 million, and foreign orders are pouring in. The Dalian Heavy Machinery Plant, established in 1914, originally produced outdated products, and the entire factory was worried about not having enough to eat. After 1984, they seized the opportunity of opening up, developing cooperative production with more than 20 companies from countries like West Germany and Japan, and taking the path of introducing technology, cooperative production, digestion, and innovation. They quickly raised six major product categories to an advanced level, providing a batch of equipment originally intended for import to key national industrial projects such as Shanghai Baosteel, Shandong Stone Mill Port, and Qinhuangdao Port. Last year, it was approved as a base enterprise for exporting mechanical and electrical products.

There are many other enterprises that have undergone such significant changes. Opening up has enabled a large number of old enterprises in Dalian to play a pillar role in the economy. In recent years, the city's self-operated export earnings have increased by $100 million each year.

Utilizing foreign capital is another wheel in Dalian's opening up. By the end of June this year, the city had approved 657 foreign-invested projects with a contract value of $1.45 billion. The city has established 291 foreign-invested enterprises, many of which are excellent projects. They are not only large in scale and high in technology, but also strong in foreign exchange earnings. Moreover, they have a significant demonstration effect in management, technological progress, and other aspects. In recent years, the Dalian Huanying-Xiaoyodaka Cement Co., Ltd., a Sino-Japanese joint venture with a total investment of $150 million, the Japanese-invested Wanbao Motor Co., Ltd. with a total investment of over $30 million, and the production of advanced valves, non-shaped refractory materials, and disposable medical devices are among the outstanding foreign-invested enterprises. When they start production, they will play an important role in the city's economic takeoff in the 1990s and the next century.

Opening up has pushed Dalian onto the international stage. Facing both domestic and international markets, opportunities and competition are breeding new mechanisms and releasing new vitality.

Since the end of last year, like many other cities in the country, Dalian has faced pressures of insufficient funds and raw materials. However, in the first five months of this year, the city's industrial output value increased by 11% compared to the same period last year, and realized profits and taxes increased by 14.8%, with the growth in benefits exceeding the growth in speed. People have different opinions on this, but one view is becoming more consensus: the benefits of the new mechanisms bred by opening up.

Opening up has given Dalian the opportunity to fully leverage its various advantages. As the "window" of Northeast China, Dalian continuously provides conditions and services for the development of the hinterland, while the hinterland provides a material foundation for the development of the "window." Thus, Dalian's radiation effect on both domestic and international fronts is rapidly increasing, and the scope of its international exchanges is becoming increasingly broad. Opening up has also pushed many enterprises in the city onto the world market, and enterprises are showing unprecedented vigor. A responsible person from the Dalian Refrigeration Machinery Factory told us that currently, there are more than 700 competitors in the domestic industry, and the competition is very fierce. They believe that competing in the domestic market is not true skill, and participating in international competition is the real test of skill. This factory has improved its operating mechanism in the process of reform and opening up, making the enterprise full of vitality. Now, its products are exported to 24 countries and regions including Japan and Hong Kong. In the international bidding for industrial refrigeration equipment system projects, it defeated strong competitors from the United States, Japan, Denmark, and other countries with advantages in quality, price, and other aspects, and won the bid.

Dalian used to have no foreign trade rights, but today it is the largest foreign trade port in Northeast China. More than 70 trade organizations from around the world have set up offices here, and thousands of businessmen from various countries come to negotiate business every year. Dalian's old enterprises, new enterprises, and township enterprises are seeking opportunities and facing new challenges in this new world.

Implementing "one reform and three improvements," an environment suitable for the survival and development of foreign-invested enterprises has been initially formed.

The main idea of Dalian's transformation and improvement of its own conditions is: starting from long-term opening up, implementing "one reform and three improvements," that is, improving the investment environment, improving work efficiency, improving civilization, and improving service attitudes, to establish a relatively complete investment environment; in the economic and technological development zone, breaking the old model, gradually establishing a set of environments suitable for the survival and development of international capital, making the production and living guarantee system better than the old urban areas.

While carrying out infrastructure construction, the city leaders have focused on improving work efficiency. They first made changes in the organizational structure, breaking the old pattern of government departments dividing responsibilities, and concentrating the relevant approval units for introducing projects into one place to form an authoritative and powerful Foreign Economic and Technological Cooperation Management Center, allowing foreigners to complete all approval procedures in one building. In the development zone, which is ahead in reform, a "concentrated power" agency, the Project Promotion Center, was established. In the past, foreigners had to go through more than 20 departments and 30 procedures, including industrial and commercial administration, taxation, finance, banking, planning, and urban construction, to approve a project in the development zone. Now, foreigners only need to enter one door to handle many things, saving a lot of time compared to the past. The improvement of regulations and the initial formation of markets for funds, production materials, and talents have also formed a new situation between the Development Zone Management Committee, as a dispatched agency of the municipal government, and enterprises.

During the interview, someone told us that in November last year, at the invitation of Premier Li Peng, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry organized more than 90 businessmen to come to China to inspect the investment environment of major open cities, leaving a deep impression on Dalian. Some comments said that Dalian's investment environment is practical and reliable, a place where one can invest with confidence. This is almost the same as the feedback we have heard from many foreigners.

    开放在大连（上）
    陆振华　沙秀敏
    大连市充满着开放城市的特有生机。
    走在车水马龙的大街上和新兴的开发区，许多富有现代色彩的国际酒店、国际博览中心、银帆宾馆、高架桥等建筑物映入眼帘；数百个外商投资企业坐落在各街区；开放已使大连走上国际舞台。最近，日中经济开发研讨会、大连国际经济合作研讨会和中国东北地区暨内蒙古出口商品交易会等重大涉外经济贸易和学术活动相继在这里召开，成千上万名宾客纷至沓来，一项项中外经济技术合作构想在这里成了现实。
    大连的起飞靠的是什么？
    把开放的基本点放在增强全市经济实力上，引进来，打出去，再引进来，再打出去
    大连对外开放比南方率先开放的地区起步晚三四年。但是大连人不攀比速度，着重求实效。市领导和一批实干家把改革开放的着眼点放在增强城市经济实力上。在改造老企业，兴办外商投资企业，建设开发区，增强出口能力等方面下功夫。
    大连有数千个老企业需要技术改造，市委、市政府决定首先在改造老企业上做好文章。5年多来，全市拿出数亿美元购买先进技术设备或同国外企业进行合作生产、合资经营等多种形式，引来了上千项国外先进技术设备，使600多个企业得到改造，有些企业出现了“跳跃式”的提高。
    大连人建议我们看看那些经过改造的老企业。果然，这些老企业厂房虽不如合资企业那样洋气，但厂房内几乎发生了脱胎换骨的变化。具有90年历史的大连造船厂，近年来吸收了国外技术，使自己的造船技术提高到80年代水平，先后建造了数十种具有“全国第一”之称的新船舶，出口成交额超过3亿美元，国外订单应接不暇。建厂于1914年的大连重型机器厂，原来产品落后，全厂职工都为“吃不饱”犯愁。1984年以后，他们紧紧抓住开放契机，先后与联邦德国、日本等国家的20多家公司发展合作生产，走出了一条引进技术、合作生产、消化创新的路子，很快把六大类产品提高到先进水平，为上海宝钢、山东石臼所港、秦皇岛港等国家重点工业建设提供了一批原准备进口的设备。去年还被批准为机电产品出口基地企业。
    像这样变化大的企业还有许多。开放使大连一大批老企业发挥了经济支柱的作用。近年来，全市自营出口创汇能力每年递增1亿美元。
    利用外资是大连开放中的另一个轮子。到今年6月底，全市已批准利用外资657项，合同金额达14.5亿美元。全市兴办外商投资企业291家，许多是不可多得的好项目。它们不仅规模大，技术水平高，创汇能力强，而且在经营管理、技术进步方面具有较大的示范作用。近年来批准的总投资为1.5亿美元的中日合资企业大连华能——小野田水泥有限公司，总投资3000多万美元的日本独资企业万宝至马达有限公司，以及制造先进阀门、不定型耐火材料、一次性医疗器具等，就是外商投资企业中的佼佼者。当它们投产后对这个城市90年代以至下个世纪的经济起飞产生重要作用。
    开放把大连推向国际舞台。面对国内国外两个市场，机遇和竞争孕育着新的机制，激发出新的活力
    去年底以来，大连和全国许多城市一样，遇到了资金、原材料紧缺的压力，但是今年前5个月工业产值比去年同期增长11％，实现利税比去年同期增长14.8％，效益增长高于速度增长。对此人们看法不尽相同，但有一种意见趋于一致：得益于开放后孕育的新机制。
    开放，使大连市的各种优势获得充分发挥的机会。作为东北“窗口”的大连，不断为腹地发展提供条件和服务，腹地为“窗口”发展提供物质基础。于是，大连对内对外的辐射作用迅速增加，参与的国际交换领域越来越广泛；开放，又把市内众多的企业推向世界市场，企业呈现出从未有过的旺盛活力。大连冷冻机厂一位负责人告诉我们，当今国内同行业有700多家，竞争十分激烈，他们认为在国内市场“争饭吃”，不算真本领，参与国际竞争，这才算真本领。这个厂在改革、开放中全面完善经营机制，使企业生机勃勃。现在，该厂产品已出口日本、香港等24个国家和地区，在工业制冷设备系统工程国际招标中，以质量、价格等优势击败美、日、丹麦等国的世界强手，一举中标。
    大连过去没有外贸权，今天已是东北地区最大的外贸口岸，世界上70多家贸易机构在此设了办事处，每年成千上万名各国厂商前来洽谈生意。大连的老企业、新兴企业和乡镇企业在这新的世界里寻找机遇，迎接新的挑战。
    实行“一改三提高”，现在一个适应外商投资企业生存、发展的环境已初步形成
    大连市改造和完善自身条件的主要思路是：从长期开放出发，实行“一改三提高”，即改善投资环境，提高办事效率，提高文明程度，提高服务态度，建立一个比较配套的投资环境；在经济技术开发区，打破旧模式，逐步建立一套适合国际资本生存、发展的小环境，使生产和生活保障系统优于老市区。
    在进行基础设施建设的同时，市领导把眼睛盯在提高工作效率上。他们首先在机构上动了一刀，打破政府各部门分兵把口的旧格局，把有关审批引进项目的单位集中在一起，组成一个有职有权的对外经济技术合作管理中心，让外商在一个楼里迅速办完所有审批手续。在改革先走一步的开发区，成立“集权式”的办事机构——项目推进中心。过去外商在开发区审批项目，需要经过工商、税务、财政、银行、规划、城建等20多个部门、30多道工序，现在外商只进一个门，就可以办成许多事，所花时间比过去节省许多倍。法规的健全，资金、生产资料、人才市场的初步形成，使作为市政府派出机构的开发区管委会，和企业之间的关系也形成了新局面。
    在采访的时候，有人告诉我们，去年11月，应李鹏总理的邀请，日本通产省曾组织90多名企业家来华考察主要开放城市的投资环境后，对大连留下了深刻的印象。有的评论说，大连的投资环境配套实用，是个放心投资的地方。这同我们听到的许多外商的反映几乎完全一样。
