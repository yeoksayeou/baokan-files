Title: The Harder the Better to Investigate

The Ministry of Public Security recently reported four serious cases of extortion and bribery, involving a household registration police officer from a public security sub-bureau, a deputy secretary of a regional political and legal committee, a director of a public security bureau, a director of a household registration office, and an official from the exit-entry management office of a public security bureau.

In the public security forces, such individuals are in the minority. However, they are law enforcement officers who break the law, which is particularly heinous. Under the guise of public security personnel, they commit wrongdoings more conveniently, more effectively, and are harder to investigate. It is precisely because criminals in party and government agencies and key departments often rely on their "strong credentials" and "large offices," and even have "backers" and "networks," that the struggle against these criminals is even more arduous.

The harder it is, the more we must investigate. To investigate and deal with criminals in party and government agencies and key departments, in addition to relying on the supervision and exposure of the broad masses of the people, it is even more important for the relevant agencies to voluntarily expose corruption and voluntarily eliminate corrupt elements in the process of strengthening their own clean governance. The aforementioned four cases are examples of how local public security agencies, under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Security and local party committees and governments, have seriously addressed clean governance and handled these cases. The Ministry of Public Security's report reflects the importance and determination of the fight against corruption.

    越难越要查
    民仆
    公安部日前通报了四起严重索贿受贿案，案犯有公安派出所户籍警、地委政法委副书记、公安处处长、公安局户政科科长、公安厅出入境管理处干部。
    在公安队伍中，这样的人是极少数。但他们是执法人员，执法犯法，尤其恶劣。他们顶着公安人员的名义干坏事，比一般人更方便，更厉害，更不容易查处。正是因为党政机关和要害部门的违法犯罪分子往往自恃“牌子硬”、“衙门大”，甚至还有“后台”和“关系网”，因此和这些犯罪分子的斗争就更艰巨。
    越难越要查。要查处党政机关和要害部门犯罪分子，除了要靠广大人民群众的监督、揭发，更要靠有关机关在加强自身廉政建设中自觉揭露腐败现象，自觉清除腐败分子。上面的那4起案件，就是各地公安机关在公安部和当地党委、政府领导下，认真抓廉政建设中查处的。公安部这个通报，反映的是对腐败斗争的重视和决心。
