Xinhua News Agency, London, August 7th.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has agreed to direct talks between Britain and Argentina. This is seen as a signal that the two countries may restore normal diplomatic relations and that Buenos Aires may formally end its state of hostility in the South Atlantic.

The *Times* reported today that the ambassadors of Britain and Argentina to the United Nations will meet directly in New York within the next two weeks. This will be the first direct contact between the two countries since their representatives attempted to hold direct talks in Bern, Switzerland, in 1984, which failed due to the sovereignty issue over the Malvinas Islands. The relationship between Britain and Argentina has been complex since the Malvinas conflict in 1982. The recent breakthrough is the result of the two countries' concerted efforts over the past seven to eight weeks, particularly in light of the recent announcement by Argentina's newly elected president to lift trade restrictions against Britain.

The report said that although the sovereignty issue over the Malvinas Islands is not on the agenda for the New York meeting, the talks will cover all other major issues. The report said that Argentina will push for Britain to lift the 150-mile protection zone around the Malvinas Islands. In return, Argentine President Menem will formally declare an end to the state of hostility.

The report said that Thatcher's decision to agree to direct talks between Britain and Argentina was made after the new Argentine president clearly stated that the talks could avoid mentioning the sovereignty issue over the Malvinas Islands.

    玛·撒切尔首相同意
    英阿直接谈判
    本报伦敦8月7日电　记者陈特安报道：英国首相撒切尔夫人已同意英国与阿根廷直接谈判，这是两国可能恢复正常外交关系以及布宜诺斯艾利斯可能正式结束在南大西洋与英国敌对状态的一个信号。
    《泰晤士报》今天在报道这一消息时说，英、阿两国驻联合国大使将于今后两周内在纽约举行直接会晤。这是继1984年英、阿两国代表试图在瑞士伯尔尼直接谈判因马岛主权问题未果之后，两国之间的第一次直接接触。英、阿两国自1982年马岛冲突后关系曲折，目前出现的这一新的突破，是两国在过去七八周内精心努力的结果，尤其与最近阿根廷新上任总统宣布解除对英贸易限制更有密切的关系。
    报道说，尽管马岛主权问题没有列入纽约会晤的日程，但会谈内容将包括所有其它重大问题。报道说，阿根廷方面将努力推进英国解除马岛周围150英里保护区；作为回报，阿根廷梅内姆总统将正式宣布结束敌对状态。
    报道说，撒切尔夫人同意英阿直接谈判的决定，是在阿根廷新总统明确表示会谈可不提及马岛主权问题后作出的。
