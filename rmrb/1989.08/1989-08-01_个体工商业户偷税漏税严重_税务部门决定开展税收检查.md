Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 1st.

Individual industrial and commercial households that earn income through honest labor and legal business operations are protected, but they must pay taxes in accordance with the law. Starting from August, the tax authorities will conduct a nationwide inspection of the tax situation of individual industrial and commercial households over the next two months. Through this inspection, the tax authorities aim to rectify tax order, strengthen tax collection and management, stop tax evasion, plug income loopholes, and alleviate issues of unfair distribution.

It is reported that as of now, there are over 14.5 million individual industrial and commercial households nationwide, employing over 23 million people. The development of the individual economy has played a positive role in promoting production, activating the market, facilitating daily life, expanding employment, and increasing fiscal revenue. Statistics show that in 1988, individual industrial and commercial households paid a total of 9.2 billion yuan in various taxes. However, currently, tax evasion among individual industrial and commercial households is still widespread, with evasion rates generally reaching 70-80%. More seriously, some lawless individuals among these households resort to violent tax resistance, attacking tax authorities, and verbally or physically assaulting tax officials, severely disrupting the lawful execution of duties by tax personnel.

Gold said these phenomena not only result in significant tax revenue losses, reducing national fiscal income, but also disrupt normal economic order, exacerbate social distribution inequalities, and provoke public discontent. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen management and conduct an inspection and rectification of the tax situation of individual industrial and commercial households.

The scope of this inspection and rectification includes individual industrial and commercial households engaged in industries such as manufacturing, commerce, transportation, construction, catering services, repair and maintenance, and other business activities. The focus will be on large individual industrial and commercial households, those with frequent changes in business operations, and those with poor tax payment records. The main inspection contents include the tax registration status of individual households; accounting and voucher situations; procurement links and wholesale tax deduction situations; whether the production, operation, procurement, sales, inventory, and income situations of individual households match their declarations, and if there are any tax evasion issues.

Gold told reporters that the State Taxation Administration has made strengthening the tax collection and management of individual industrial and commercial households a key task for the year, aiming to achieve breakthrough progress by the end of the year. For any tax evasion issues discovered, it is necessary to resolutely enforce the law.

    个体工商业户偷税漏税严重  税务部门决定开展税收检查
    本报北京8月1日讯　记者王锦鹄、李克夫报道：国家税务局局长金鑫今天在这里说，个体工商业户通过诚实劳动、合法经营所取得的收入受保护，但必须依法纳税。从8月份起，利用两个月时间，税务部门将在全国进行一次个体工商业户税收情况大检查。通过整顿税收秩序，进一步加强征收管理，制止偷漏税行为，堵塞收入漏洞，缓解分配不公的问题。
    据悉，截至目前为止，全国已有个体工商业户1450多万户，从业人员2300多万。个体经济的发展，对于促进生产、活跃市场、方便群众生活、扩大劳动就业、增加财政收入等方面都起到了积极作用。据统计，1988年全国个体工商业户交纳各项税款达92亿元。但是，目前个体工商业户偷税漏税现象仍比较普遍，偷漏税面一般高达70—80％。更严重的是，个体工商业户中少数不法分子以暴力抗税，围攻税务机关，谩骂殴打税务干部，严重干扰了税务人员依法执行公务。
    金鑫说，这些现象不仅导致大量税款流失，减少国家财政收入，而且干扰了正常的经济秩序，加剧了社会分配不公的矛盾，引起群众不满。因此，必须切实加强管理，对个体工商业户税收情况进行一次检查整顿。
    这次检查整顿的范围包括从事工业、商业、交通运输、建筑安装、饮食服务、修理修配以及从事其它经营活动的个体工商户。检查重点是个体工商大户、经营情况变化频繁和纳税情况差的个体户。检查内容主要是个体户的税务登记情况；帐务、票证情况；进货环节和批发扣税情况；个体户生产经营、购销存货情况和收入情况是否与本人申报相符，有无偷漏税问题等。
    金鑫告诉记者，国家税务局已把加强个体工商业户税收征管确定为今年的工作重点，争取年内取得突破性进展。对查出的偷漏税问题，必须坚决依法办事。
