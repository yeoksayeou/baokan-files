"The Republic and Me – Reflections on National Day"

When mentioning "The Republic and Me," every Chinese citizen living in this era will surely recall many personal experiences and have much to say. Especially now, as October 1st approaches. On October 1st, 1949, a great historical voice echoed across Tiananmen Square: "The Chinese people have stood up!" Forty years later, this voice has resonated across the land of China and around the world.

Looking back, the journey has been filled with challenges and remarkable achievements that inspire the heart; looking forward, there are even greater tasks ahead and more glorious creations to be made, which fill us with anticipation. Our great motherland is in its prime, and socialism is full of vitality. Reflecting on the past and the future, every Chinese person who shares the fate of the Republic cannot help but feel filled with passion and pride, courage and strength.

To celebrate the great achievements of the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially the magnificent accomplishments of the 10 years of reform and opening up, to reflect the heroic deeds of the people on all fronts, and to express the sincere love for the Party and the People's Republic, our newspaper has decided to launch the "The Republic and Me – Reflections on National Day" essay contest starting today. Dear readers, please pick up your pens and write about the extraordinary journey of the past 40 years, the tremendous changes in the Republic, and your own growth and the changes around you, expressing your sincere patriotic feelings.

Essays should be written in the first person, with completely true content, focusing on events and incorporating emotions. The ideal length is around 1500 words. The deadline is September 30th. Please send your submissions to the editorial office of People's Daily (Postal Code: 100733), clearly marking "essay contest," and affixing sufficient postage. We regret that we cannot return manuscripts.

After the contest, we will select 3 first prizes, 5 second prizes, and 10 third prizes, and provide appropriate awards.
