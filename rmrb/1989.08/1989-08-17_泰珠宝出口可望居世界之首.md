Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 16th.

According to a recent report released by Thailand's Export Promotion Bureau, after nearly a decade of development in the gem industry, Thailand is poised to become the world's largest gem exporter.

Currently, Thailand's gemstone exports rank second in the world, just behind India, and its jewelry exports rank second, following Italy. In recent years, Thailand's gem exports have been on the rise, while exports from countries like Italy have been declining.

Gemstone and jewelry exports have become Thailand's fourth-largest source of foreign exchange earnings. Last year, they generated $550 million in foreign exchange.
