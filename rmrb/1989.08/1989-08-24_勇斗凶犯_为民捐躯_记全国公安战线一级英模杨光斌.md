On August 4 of this year, the Ministry of Public Security issued an order, posthumously awarding Yang Guangbin, a police officer from the Shayan City Public Security Bureau in Hubei Province, the title of National Public Security First-Class Hero Model.

As long as there is a breath of life, criminals must not be allowed to escape

At dawn on June 9, a sharp gunshot echoed through the night sky. "Someone is armed and robbing!" The Shayan City Public Security Bureau quickly set up roadblocks and prepared to capture the armed criminals. Officers from the Qinghekou Substation of the Fan Dong Public Security Bureau, including Yang Guangbin, were stationed at the Qinghe Bridge, ready to apprehend the criminals. The substation chief, Liu Fuxiang, whispered, "Guangbin, they have submachine guns. Are you afraid?" Yang Guangbin smiled calmly and said, "In our line of work, as long as we have a breath of life, we cannot let the criminals escape!"

At 11 AM, the substation chief arranged for Yang Guangbin and others to return to the substation to continue handling the robbery case that occurred on June 6. The criminals, Yang Bo and two others, robbed the Xinyang County Hospital, and Yang Bo was captured on the spot, while the other two fled. After much effort, the cunning Yang Bo revealed the whereabouts of his accomplice, Li Xingzhang.

That evening at around 9 PM, Yang Guangbin led the officers Mao Qinghe and the public security volunteers Zheng Xingxiong and Lu Shunguang, escorting the criminal Yang Bo, through a narrow alley, to a resident's home near Dacai Dong Road. Yang Bo pointed to the second-floor room with an awning on the north side and said, "That's where Li Xingzhang rents a room."

Yang Guangbin and Zheng Xingxiong quickly went upstairs. Little Zheng knocked on the door. Someone inside asked, "Who is it?" Yang Guangbin replied, "Me!" The person inside asked again, "Are you Gao Xiaolin (Li Xingzhang's accomplice)?" Yang Guangbin quickly responded with a "yes." The door slowly opened, and Zheng Xingxiong quickly pushed the door open. In this small room of less than 7 square meters, there were two men and two women. Li Xingzhang, seeing that it was the police, was startled and quickly stood up from the bed, pointing a new submachine gun at Yang Guangbin and Zheng Xingxiong, shouting, "Get out, get out! If you don't get out, I'll shoot!"

Yang Guangbin remained calm. His professional instincts told him that this was not an ordinary criminal but a desperate, armed robber. He suppressed his anger and tried to reason, "Little Li, don't be reckless. Your father, Li Tian Shu, sent me to find you. He misses you." The criminal shouted back, "Don't play that trick with me. Today, it's either you or me!"

Yang Guangbin saw that the cornered criminal was showing his true colors. He quickly drew his gun from its holster and chambered a round.

Yang Guangbin signaled with his eyes for Little Zheng to jump through the back window to disarm the criminal. Little Zheng understood and was about to move, but the cunning Li Xingzhang roared, "You won't get away with that!"

The criminal, Li Xingzhang, in a desperate move, fired his gun, "Bang, bang, bang..." The muzzle flashed with a streak of blue light.

Almost simultaneously, Yang Guangbin bravely retaliated, firing two shots, hitting Li Xingzhang in the chest and abdomen. Li Xingzhang let out a scream, covering his wounds, and turned off the light, rushing out of the room, ready to spray bullets at the residents.

At this critical moment, Yang Guangbin, despite being hit by five bullets and on the verge of death, summoned his last ounce of strength to fire his final shot. Li Xingzhang was killed instantly.

Zheng Xingxiong was hit in the head and died a heroic death. Yang Guangbin lay in a pool of blood. The officers carried him to the Xinyang County Hospital. However, Yang Guangbin, only 35 years old, closed his eyes forever.

Yang Guangbin, with his boundless love for the people and his deep hatred for criminals, left us so suddenly! He had submitted his application to join the Party, and the Party organization had already included him in this year's "July 1" development plan, but he didn't have time to fill out the "Party Membership Application Form"; his 9-year-old son had just taken an exam, and he didn't have time to look at the results; his elderly mother had broken her arm, and he didn't have time to take her to the hospital...

The public security officers turned their grief into strength, set up roadblocks, and pursued the criminals. Through thorough investigation and interrogation, they captured all 7 accomplices within 16 hours.

From Militia to Anti-Pickpocket Expert

Yang Guangbin was born into a peasant family. After graduating from junior high school, he became a militia member. One evening, he caught someone stealing a battery from the Xinyang Bearing Factory, seized it, and returned it to the factory. Later, someone in the village advised him to mind his own business, but he said, "When bad guys do bad things, I have to stop them!" He trained hard and became a famous "sniper" and "grappling expert" in the area, and was promoted to the rank of militia squad leader.

In August 1974, Yang Guangbin was selected by the city Public Security Bureau to serve as a detention center guard. A year later, he was transferred to a police officer, fulfilling his dream of becoming a people's protector.

Seeing this strong and capable young man, the team leader nodded in satisfaction and said, "Good, you will go to the anti-pickpocket team!" In the anti-pickpocket team, Yang Guangbin worked for seven years. His case records show a series of numbers: 7 years, 210 pickpocket cases solved, 420 pickpockets caught, making him the team's pickpocket expert.

In the autumn of 1981, to catch a pickpocket, Yang Guangbin chased the suspect from the train station to Xinhua Road. The pickpocket jumped over a wall into a cesspool, and Yang Guangbin followed. In the chest-deep sewage, a struggle ensued. The pickpocket took advantage of Yang Guangbin's momentary loss of balance, pounced on him, and tried to push him under the sewage. Yang Guangbin choked on a few mouthfuls of sewage, seized the opportunity, and performed a "water grab," followed by a body twist and chokehold, subduing the pickpocket.

Just after the Spring Festival this year, the Qinghekou Substation received several reports of theft. The substation chief assigned Yang Guangbin to investigate several theft cases. Yang Guangbin conducted open and covert investigations, based on information provided by the public, and together with all the officers in the substation, uncovered a major theft gang. They solved 81 cases, including 10 major cases, arrested 15 criminals, and seized cash and stolen goods worth 21,000 yuan.

Upholding Integrity and Justice is His Motto

In October 1988, the son of the director of the Construction Department of the Municipal Electronics Industry Bureau, Zhang Jianjun, was arrested for theft. Yang Guangbin was in charge of the case. The director found out Yang Guangbin's address and visited him several times, trying to bribe him to "show mercy." Yang Guangbin politely declined. The director then held a banquet at the Municipal Second Reception Hall, which Yang Guangbin also declined. The director couldn't believe there were people who didn't love money, so he found out that Yang Guangbin's parents lived in the suburbs and needed some lumber, paint, and steel for their dilapidated house. He immediately found Yang Guangbin and whispered, "I'll take care of all the building materials for your parents' house," and then said, "Only you and I know about this, and nothing will go wrong." Yang Guangbin sternly replied, "I do need these building materials, but I cannot use my power for personal gain."

Before his death, Yang Guangbin owed more than 1,000 yuan for helping his parents build their house.

Yang Guangbin upheld justice in his cases. His superior's brother was caught pickpocketing, and he arrested him three times. Finally, he gathered enough evidence to send him to labor reform for three years. Someone reported to him that a leader's son had committed a crime, and he asked, "Do you dare to catch him?" Yang Guangbin followed the leader's son and, when he was about to flee after committing a crime, Yang Guangbin quickly caught him and took him back to the criminal investigation squad. A well-meaning friend worried for him and said, "Aren't you afraid they will make things difficult for you?" Yang Guangbin said, "I only recognize the law, not the person. No matter who it is, if they break the law, I will handle it!"

After the deaths of Yang Guangbin and Zheng Xingxiong, the Hubei Provincial Government approved them as revolutionary martyrs. The Shayan City Committee posthumously approved Yang Guangbin as a formal member of the Communist Party, and the city government posthumously awarded him the title of "Heroic Police Officer Who Bravely Fights Against Enemies."

    勇斗凶犯　为民捐躯
    ——记全国公安战线一级英模杨光斌
    张敢　王齐生　刘树明
    今年8月4日，公安部发布命令，追授湖北省襄樊市公安局民警杨光斌同志全国公安战线一级英雄模范称号。
    只要一息尚存，就不能让凶犯逃掉
    6月9日凌晨，一阵清脆的枪声震憾夜空。“有人持枪抢劫！”湖北省襄樊市公安局迅速设卡堵截，张网以待。市樊东公安分局清河口派出所民警杨光斌等同志守候在清河桥头，准备缉拿持枪案犯。所长刘福祥悄声问：“光斌，他们有冲锋枪，怕吗？”杨光斌淡淡一笑说：“搞我们这行的，只要有一口气就不能让罪犯跑掉！”
    上午11点，所长安排杨光斌等同志回所继续办理6月6日抢劫案。案犯杨波等3人在襄阳县医院抢劫作案，杨犯被现场抓获，另两犯逃走。几经周折，才迫使狡猾的杨波交待出同伙李兴章及住处。
    当晚9时许，杨光斌带领民警毛清河和治安联防队员郑兴雄、鲁顺群，押着案犯杨波，穿过狭窄的小巷，来到大庆东路一户居民家附近。杨波指着二楼北侧有凉棚的房间说：“那儿就是李兴章租的房子”。
    杨光斌和郑兴雄迅即上楼。小郑敲门，屋内问：“谁？”杨光斌答：“我！”屋内又问：“你是不是高小林（李兴章的同伙）！”杨光斌机警地“嗯”了一声。门徐徐打开，郑兴雄急速推门进屋。这间不足7平方米的小屋，正混居着两男两女。李兴章见是派出所来人，大吃一惊，“嗖”地从床上站起，端着崭新的轻型冲锋枪，黑洞洞的枪口对着杨光斌、郑兴雄，凶神恶煞地吼道：“出去，给老子出去！不出去就开枪！”
    杨光斌镇定自若。职业的敏感，使他立即看出这不是一般的案犯，而是极度疯狂、持枪抢劫的凶犯。他强压怒火，巧妙周旋：“小李子，莫胡来，你老爹李天书叫我来找你回去，他很挂念你”。凶犯狂叫：“你们莫来这一套，今天不是你死就是我亡！”
    杨光斌见穷途末路的案犯凶相毕露，右手敏捷地从枪套里拔出手枪，推弹上膛。
    杨光斌用眼神示意小郑从后窗翻进夺枪，小郑心领神会，正欲动步，狡猾的李兴章咆哮道：“你们休想夺枪！”
    案犯李兴章狗急跳墙，凶恶地扣动扳机“哒哒哒……”枪口喷出一串罪恶的蓝光。
    几乎在同时，杨光斌英勇还击，连射两弹，击中李犯胸部、腹部。李犯“啊”地惨叫一声，捂着伤口，靠在墙上，拉熄电灯，冲出房门，正欲对居民区群众扫射。
    在这千钧一发之际，身中五弹生命垂危的杨光斌以惊人的毅力，打响了最后一枪，李兴章当场毙命。
    郑兴雄头部中弹，壮烈牺牲。杨光斌倒在殷红的血泊中，干警们将他抬往襄阳县医院。然而，年仅35岁的杨光斌却永远地闭上了双眼。
    杨光斌带着对人民的无限热爱和对罪犯的刻骨仇恨走了，走得那样匆忙！他递交了入党申请书，党组织虽已将他纳入今年“七·一”发展计划，他还没来得及填写《入党志愿书》；9岁的儿子考试后，他还没来得及看看成绩通知单；老母亲胳膊摔断，也还没来得及带她到医院治疗……
    公安干警化悲痛为力量，围截追捕，深查细访，仅16小时就将7名同案犯全部抓获。
    从基干民兵到反扒能手
    杨光斌出生在一个农民家庭，初中毕业后他当上了基干民兵。一天晚上，他发现有人从襄阳轴承厂偷出一个电瓶，上前拦住，夺了下来，送回工厂。事后，村里有人劝他少管闲事，他说：“坏蛋做坏事，我就要制止！”他刻苦训练，成了远近闻名的“神枪手”和“擒拿能手”，被提拔为基干民兵排长。
    1974年8月，杨光斌被市公安局选拔担任收审所看守员，一年后转为民警，实现了当人民卫士的愿望。
    面对这个身强力壮的小伙，队长满意地点点头说：“好，你就到反扒队吧！”到了反扒队，杨光斌一干就是七年，侦破记录本上记载着一串数字：7年共破获扒窃案件210起，抓获扒手420名，是全队反扒能手。
    1981年秋，为抓一个扒手，杨光斌从火车站追到新华路。扒手翻墙跳入粪池，他也翻墙跳入粪池。在齐胸深的粪水中，展开了搏斗，扒手乘杨光斌没站稳，猛扑上去卡住脖子往粪水里按。杨光斌呛了几口粪水，乘势来个“水中捞月”，接着转体锁喉，制服了扒犯。
    今年春节刚过，清河口派出所不断接到报案电话。所长把侦破几起盗窃案的任务交给杨光斌。杨光斌明查暗访，根据群众提供的情报，与全所干警一道，挖出一个重大盗窃团伙，破案81起，其中大案10起，逮捕案犯15名，缴获现金和赃物折款21000元。
    廉洁秉公是他的座右铭
    1988年10月，市电子工业局基建科科长的儿子张建军因盗窃作案被收审，杨光斌经办这起案件。科长多方打听杨光斌住址，三番五次登门送礼，想要杨光斌“高抬贵手”，杨光斌婉言谢绝了。科长又在市二招大摆宴席，又被杨光斌推辞了。这位科长不相信世上还有不爱钱的人，他打听到杨光斌父母住郊区因房屋破旧急需一些木材、油漆和钢筋后，马上找到杨光斌，悄声地说：“你父母房子的建筑材料我都包了”，接着又说：“这事只有天知地知你知我知，不会出什么问题的”。杨光斌义正严辞道：“我是急需这些建筑材料，但我不能拿权力做交易”。
    在杨光斌牺牲前，因帮父母建房欠款1000多元。
    杨光斌秉公办案。他的顶头上司的弟弟扒窃作案，他先后抓获3次，最后落实材料，将其送劳教3年。有人向他反映，某领导干部的儿子作案，你们敢不敢抓？杨光斌得知后跟踪这位领导干部儿子，正当他作案后准备溜走时，杨光斌一个箭步上前，将其抓获，押回刑警大队。好心的朋友为他担心说：“你不怕他们给你穿小鞋？”杨光斌说：“我只认法不认人。不管什么人只要他犯了法我就要管！”
    杨光斌、郑兴雄牺牲后，湖北省人民政府批准杨光斌、郑兴雄二同志为革命烈士。襄樊市委追认杨光斌同志为中共正式党员，市政府追授杨光斌同志“顽强歼敌英雄民警”称号。
