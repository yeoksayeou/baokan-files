Since the founding of New China, our country has carried out large-scale economic construction in a planned manner, achieving remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, from 1950 to 1988, the cumulative fixed asset investment of state-owned enterprises nationwide reached 215.38 billion yuan. A total of 4,393 large and medium-sized projects have been completed and put into operation, adding 156.19 billion yuan in fixed assets. This has laid a relatively solid material and technological foundation for the development of productive forces, the adjustment of production layout, and the improvement of people's lives.

In the field of industrial construction:

By 1988, compared to 1949, the production capacity of industries such as coal, electricity, steel, and textiles had increased by several times, even tens of times. During this period, new industrial sectors such as automobiles, tractors, aircraft, electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace, and nuclear industry were established. Now, China has built an independent and relatively complete industrial system. The industrial layout has also improved, with new industrial bases built in the vast interior and regions with concentrated ethnic minorities.

In the field of agriculture and water conservancy:

The treatment of major rivers has been significantly effective, with a total length of approximately 170,000 kilometers of new dikes built, and over 80,000 reservoirs constructed. Generally, flood disasters have been controlled. The effective irrigated area of farmland has expanded to over 44 million hectares. Agricultural machinery has developed from nothing to a significant presence, with a total agricultural machinery power of 265.8 billion watts.

In the field of transportation:

The total length of national railway operating lines has increased from 21,800 kilometers at the beginning of the founding of the country to over 50,000 kilometers. Many lines have been doubled, and all main railway lines have achieved internal combustion and electric locomotive traction, improving transportation capacity. Except for Tibet, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have railway access. Sichuan, which was previously isolated, has the Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Kunming, and Sichuan-Guizhou railways passing through it, becoming the transportation hub of the southwestern region. Railways have also been built in Fujian, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia. Road transportation has developed such that all counties, except for one, have road access. Civil aviation has opened 350 domestic and international routes, forming a comprehensive air transportation network. Water and pipeline transportation have also seen significant development. The facilities and handling capacity of coastal ports have been markedly improved, with over 100 ten-thousand-ton berths newly built or expanded.

In the field of postal and telecommunications:

The total length of national postal routes and rural delivery lines has increased from 706,000 kilometers at the beginning of the founding of the country to 5 million kilometers, growing by more than six times, of which 309,000 kilometers are airmail routes, growing by more than 200 times. Long-distance telephone and telegraph circuits have grown multiple times. Program-controlled telephones and optical fiber communication technologies have begun to be used in some cities' communications.

    我四十年经济建设成绩卓著  四千多大中型项目建成投产
    新华社北京8月25日电　新中国成立以来，我国有计划地进行了规模巨大的经济建设，取得了举世瞩目的成绩。据国家统计局统计，从1950年到1988年，全国全民所有制单位固定资产投资累计达21538亿元，建成投产的大中型项目有4393个，新增加固定资产15619亿元，为发展社会生产力，调整生产布局，改善人民生活，奠定了比较雄厚的物质技术基础。
    在工业建设方面：
    1988年同1949年相比，煤、电、钢铁、纺织等工业的生产能力分别有了几倍甚至几十倍的增长。在此期间，还建立了汽车、拖拉机、飞机、电子、石油化工、航天、核工业等新的工业部门。现在我国已建成了独立的、门类比较齐全的工业体系。工业布局也有所改善，在辽阔的内地和少数民族集中的地区，兴建了一批新的工业基地。
    在农业水利方面：
    大江大河的治理成效显著，新修堤防总长度约17万公里，兴建了水库8万多座，一般洪水灾害得到控制。农田有效灌溉面积扩大到4400多万公顷。农业机械从无到有发展起来，现已拥有农业机械总动力2658亿瓦特。
    在交通运输方面：
    全国铁路营业里程由建国初期的2.18万公里增加到5万多公里，不少线路铺设了双轨，全部铁路干线实现了内燃机车和电气机车牵引，提高了运输能力。各省、自治区、直辖市，除西藏外都通了火车。四川过去交通闭塞，“蜀道之难难于上青天”，现已有宝成、成渝、襄渝、成昆、川黔等铁路经过境内，成为西南地区的交通中心。福建、新疆、青海、宁夏的铁路也从无到有建设起来。公路运输，全国除一个县以外，县县都通了汽车。民用航空开通了350条国内、国际航线，构成四通八达的蓝天运输网络。水运、管道运输也有较大发展。沿海港口的设施和吞吐能力明显提高，新建和扩建了100多个万吨级泊位。
    在邮电通信方面：
    全国邮路和农村投递线路总长度由建国初期的70.6万公里增加到500万公里，增长6倍多，其中航空邮路30.9万多公里，增长200多倍。长途电话和电报电路成倍增长。程控电话、光导纤维通信技术已开始在一些城市的通信中应用。
