Edition: 6

The resumption of bus service on the Bozhou-Guantang Road has been achieved. On April 5, your newspaper's sixth edition published a letter from a reader titled "Road Bullies Monopolize Passenger Transport and Block Buses," which drew the attention of local party committees and transportation departments. The head of the Bozhou Municipal Transportation Bureau led relevant personnel to Guantang District, where they worked with district party committee leaders to address and resolve the issue of bus operations between Bozhou City and Guantang District. When the buses resumed operation, the Guantang District Party Committee specifically assigned a public security officer from the district's public security bureau to accompany the buses to maintain order and prevent road bullies from obstructing the operation of public buses.

    亳观公路班车已通
    4月5日你报第六版刊登了《路霸垄断客运阻拦客车》的读者来信后，引起了当地党委和交通部门的重视。市交通局负责人带领有关人员来到观堂区，与区委负责同志共同研究落实了亳州市至观堂区班车运行问题。班车恢复运营时，观堂区委还专门从区公安派出所抽出一位治安员随车维持秩序，制止路霸阻碍公家客车运行。
