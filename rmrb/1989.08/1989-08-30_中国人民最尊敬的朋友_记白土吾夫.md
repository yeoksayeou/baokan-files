It seems as if fate had a peculiar arrangement, as my novel reflecting the Anti-Japanese War, the second volume "Abyss," had just been published and I was in the process of revising the third volume, I found myself stepping onto Japanese soil and making acquaintances with many Japanese friends. Among them was Mr. Hitoshi Watari. Though he had entered his senior years, his hair was still as black and shiny as ever. His clean-shaven, fair face, his bright eyes full of profound meaning, his calm, pure, and gentle demeanor, all combined with his overly serious expression, gave one the impression that in his youth he must have been robust, handsome, and dignified. Before meeting him, I had already heard from my fellow writer Chen Xiru that from his university days, he had participated in the left-wing student movement. For the shared misfortunes of his compatriots and the Chinese people, he entered the anti-Fascist struggle, like a storm in the wilderness, chasing the rolling clouds. After the founding of New China, Hitoshi Watari rejoiced with the Chinese people and served as a cultural exchange envoy between China and Japan, visiting China over a hundred times. Premier Zhou Enlai had received him more than forty times. Premier Zhou and Deng Yingchao both called him, in a loud and affectionate voice, "The most respected friend of the Chinese people."

On May 1, 1989, the day after he returned to Tokyo from Beijing, he hosted a banquet for us, the Chinese writers' delegation visiting Japan. Besides him, there were Mrs. Fujiyama Junko, with her graying hair and squinting eyes, and the handsome Mr. Yokogawa Ken, both of whom had dedicated themselves to the cause of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and shared joys and sorrows with the Chinese people. The Chinese writers present were Jiang Zilong, Lin Xi, Ao Erzhe, Chen Xiru, and myself. We sat around a round table covered with a pristine white tablecloth, drinking and pouring out our hearts to each other. When we talked about the history of Sino-Japanese culture, which is as enduring as an endless river, Hitoshi Watari suddenly mentioned "River Elegy."

"You deny the traditional culture of the Chinese nation in your 'River Elegy,' which we absolutely cannot agree with," he said. "Chinese culture is not only a precious heritage of China but also nurtured Japan!" His face showed a serious and somewhat agitated expression.

This TV program, though it had sparked anger among many people in China, had received the support of the highest authority, Zhao Ziyang. Zhao Ziyang even presented it as an important gift to a foreign leader. Knowing the Chinese cultural circle well, Hitoshi Watari must have known this. We looked at him in astonishment and nodded in agreement.

At first, I felt that the atmosphere of courtesy and deference pervading the room constrained us. Gradually, unconsciously, it became lively, free, and full of laughter. Hitoshi Watari talked about China's resources, about reforms, about hopes, the more he talked, the more I was moved by his sincere and friendly heart, and by a new joyous emotion I had never experienced before. In a moment of silence, he suddenly turned to me and asked:

"Was your father a martyr who sacrificed his life in the Anti-Japanese War?"

His deep understanding of me made me feel surprised. His thick eyebrows framed eyes that were exceptionally bright, gazing at me with an expression beyond mere friendliness. His clean-shaven face bore a serene, benevolent smile, and I felt an indescribable joy.

"Yes," I replied. "I also participated in the Anti-Japanese War."

"Japanese fascist militarism committed unforgivable atrocities in China!" he said angrily. "In Nanjing alone, they massacred tens of thousands of Chinese civilians!" With his anger, sighs, hatred, and hopes, I recounted how in 1942, the Japanese fascist army, during their mopping-up operation in the eastern part of Hebei, surrounded Panjiayu Village in Fengneng County, herding over a thousand men, women, and children into a large courtyard, and carried out a brutal massacre. Not a single person knelt before the bayonets and machine guns. Some people, in their madness and helplessness, rammed into the stone walls of the courtyard, while others stood stiffly. People fell under the machine gun fire, hit in the head or chest. The living and the dead lay together like mowed wheat. The wounded writhed on the blood-soaked straw. Some half-dead individuals tried to crawl away, but they were finally stabbed to death with bayonets or beaten to death with rifle butts. In the end, the Japanese soldiers set the straw on fire, throwing even the crying children into the raging flames..."

Hitoshi Watari's face, turned towards me, showed a stern, thoughtful, and pained expression, looking at me with a retrospective gaze, listening intently.

"I believe that Japanese fascist militarism, by waging a war of aggression, pushed China into the abyss of disaster while also dragging the Japanese people into the abyss of disaster," I said. "Therefore, the title of the second volume of my novel is 'Abyss.'" I looked at our friend with the same gaze. "I hope that history will never repeat itself!"

"Mr. Hitoshi Watari," Jiang Zilong interrupted, "how did defeated Japan, under what conditions, become such a prosperous economic power in such a short time?" Jiang Zilong asked lightly and happily, obviously wanting to change the overly serious atmosphere.

Hitoshi Watari swept his kind and upright eyes over us. "There are many conditions," he said, "but our raw materials in Japan are all imported. If the supply is cut off, we will collapse." His deep, thoughtful expression made us look at him attentively. "While China can be self-reliant and feed itself." He continued, and smiled slightly. "To put it metaphorically, we Japanese are riding bicycles, and we have gone ahead. China is a tank, because of some malfunctions, it has fallen behind." He supplemented his words with gestures. "But ultimately, the tank will overtake the bicycle." I thought, only a benevolent soul could have such a magnanimous and loving heart. I believed that through repeated injuries and pain, the ideal of human friendship—mutual help, concern, and encouragement between nations and peoples—had already been manifested in him.

The conversation at the dining table interrupted my thoughts. I saw that the expressions on the faces of those present had taken on a seriousness. This expression was a sense of unease and worry about the rapidly deteriorating turmoil in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. Hitoshi Watari, with his characteristic demeanor, calmly, kindly, and resolutely said: "No matter what changes occur in our government, we will never change."

Obviously, he had already sensed something or knew that the Japanese government was preparing to take certain measures against the Chinese government. I strongly felt the seriousness and importance of the phrase "we will never change." The "we" he spoke of was naturally the broad masses of the Japanese people united by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange Association.

When the turmoil in Beijing developed into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, and when the military began imposing martial law in parts of Beijing, Hitoshi Watari and the famous Japanese writer Mizukami Tsutomu led a delegation from the Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange Association, calmly and composedly, braving lightning and heavy rain, to China for a friendly visit. In this world of deceit and change, do you have such loyal friends? When some people under the Western sky were spreading rumors and slandering the Chinese government, taking advantage of the chaos, did you hear such friends vowing "we will never change"?

    中国人民最尊敬的朋友
    ——记白土吾夫
    管桦
    好像是命运的奇特安排，我反映抗日战争的长篇小说第二部《深渊》刚出版不久，正抄改第三部的时候，踏上了日本国土，并且结识了众多的日本朋友，白土吾夫先生便是其中的一位。他虽已进入老年，但头发却黑得发亮。他的剃刮得很干净的白净的面庞，含有无限深意的黑亮的眼睛，他的沉静、纯朴、温和的外貌，调合了他过份严肃的神态，可以想象到他年轻时候是如何的健壮、漂亮、潇洒而又尊严。见面前，我已经从结伴同行的作家陈喜儒嘴里知道，他从大学时代就参加了左翼学生运动，为了他和同胞以及中国人民共有的灾难，走入反法西斯的斗争行列，如同荒野中的风暴，愤怒地追赶着滚滚云涛。新中国成立以后，白土吾夫和中国人民共庆，并做为中日人民文化交流友好使者，往来中国一百多次。周恩来总理生前接见过他四十多次。周总理和邓颖超同志都以响亮的声音，亲切地称他为“中国人民最尊敬的朋友”。
    1989年5月初，他从北京回到东京的第二天，就设宴款待我们正在日本访问的中国作家代表团，除他以外，还有鬓发灰白、眯缝着笑眼的藤山纯子女士和英俊的横川健先生，他们都是投身于日中文化交流事业，同中国人民共尝过悲哀与欢乐的老朋友。中国作家有蒋子龙、林希、敖尔则、陈喜儒和我。大家围坐在铺着洁白餐布的圆桌边，一面畅饮，一面互相倾吐胸怀，当我们谈到中日文化比奔流无尽的江河还要悠久的历史时，白土吾夫忽然提到《河殇》。
    “你们的《河殇》把中华民族的传统文化予以根本否定，我们是无论如何不能同意的。”他说，“中华文化不但是中国的宝贵遗产，还哺育了日本嘛！”他的脸上显出了严肃的、并且相当激动的表情。
    这部电视片，在国内，虽然曾引起许多人的愤怒，却得到最高权力人物赵紫阳的支持，赵紫阳还把它做为重要礼品赠送给一位外国领导人。深知中国文化界的白土吾夫当然会知道的，我们惊讶地望着他，并且赞成地点了点头。
    最初我觉得弥漫在屋子里的谦恭礼让的气氛束缚着我们。渐渐的，不知不觉的变得活泼、自由，而且谈笑风生了。白土吾夫谈到中国的资源，谈到改革，谈到希望，愈谈，我愈被他真诚友好的心灵所感动，被从未体验过的新的快乐情绪所支配。在谈话停顿的片刻，他忽然转过脸来问我：
    “您的父亲是在抗日战争中牺牲的烈士吗？”
    他对我如此深刻的了解，使我感到意外。他浓重的双眉下，异常明亮的眼睛，带着超乎亲切的表情直瞧着我，他那剃刮得干净的脸上，浮现出安详、友善的笑容，对于朋友的微笑，我感到无上的欢欣。
    “是的。”我回答说，“我也参加过抗日战争。”
    “日本法西斯军国主义，在中国犯下了不可饶恕的滔天罪行！”他愤怒地说，“在南京一下子就屠杀了几十万中国老百姓！”随着他的愤怒、叹息、仇恨和盼望，我讲述了1942年扫荡冀东的日本法西斯军队，包围了丰润县的潘家峪，把全村男女老少一千多人圈到一个大院里，进行灭绝人性的大屠杀，但是没有一个人在刺刀和机关枪口前面下跪。有些人疯狂无助地向石砌的院墙撞击，有的直挺挺地站着。人们在机关枪的扫射中倒下了，射中了头部或胸部。生者和死者像割倒的麦一般倒在一起。受伤者在血染的干草上蠕动着。有些半死的人企图爬开，但他们终于被刺刀刺死，被枪托打死。最后，日军把干草点着，连哭喊的孩子也被扔进熊熊烈火……”
    白土吾夫向我侧过来的脸，现出严正的、深思的、痛苦的表情，以回顾的眼神望着我，在细细地倾听。
    “我以为，日本法西斯军国主义的侵略战争，把中国推进灾难深渊的同时也把日本人民拖进灾难的深渊。”我说，“所以我的长篇小说第二部的书名就叫《深渊》。”我以同样的目光注视着我们的朋友，“我希望那历史永远不再折回！”我说。
    “白土吾夫先生，”蒋子龙打断了我的话，“战败的日本是靠什么条件，在短短的时间里变成这样一个经济繁荣的强国？”蒋子龙轻松愉快地问，显然他要改变一下过分严肃的气氛。
    白土吾夫用他善良而正直的眼睛扫视着我们，“条件是很多的，”他说，“但是我们日本的生产原料，完全靠外来。一但断绝来源便会倒架。”他那深沉思虑的神情，使我们注意地看着他。“而中国却完全可以自力更生，自己养活自己。”他继续说，并且微笑了一下，“打个比喻，我们日本骑着自行车，走到前面了。中国是一辆坦克，因为出些故障，落在后面了。”他用手势补充着话里的重要意义，“终久坦克要赶过自行车的。”我想，只有至善的灵魂，才有如此宏大博爱的胸怀。我相信通过重复的毁伤和痛苦，在国与国之间、民族与民族之间，要建立起互相帮助，互相关心，互相鼓励的人类之友爱的理想，已经在他的身上显示出来。
    餐桌上仍在继续的谈话打断了我的沉思。我看到在座人的面孔上，出现了认识一种严重性的表情。这表情是对北京天安门广场正在急剧恶化的动乱引起的不安和忧虑。白土吾夫以特有的风度，安详地、友善地并且是坚决自信地说道：“不管我国政府发生什么样的变化，我们是永远不会变的。”
    显然，他已经预感到了什么，或是已经知道日本政府对中国政府准备采取某些措施。我强烈地感觉到“我们永远不变”这句话所包含的严肃性与重要性，他说的“我们”自然是日中文化交流协会所团结的广大日本人民了。
    当北京发生的动乱发展成反革命暴乱的时候，当军队在北京部分地区开始戒严的时候，白土吾夫和日本著名作家水上勉带领着日中文化交流协会组成的代表团，冷静而镇定地冲过闪电和急雨来到中国，进行友好访问。在这伪诈和多变的世界里，你有这样忠诚的朋友吗？当西方的天空下，有些人正在对中国政府造谣中伤，趁火打劫的时候，你听过这样的朋友发出的“我们永远不变”的誓言吗？
