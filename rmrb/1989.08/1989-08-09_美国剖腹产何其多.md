Title: Why So Many Cesarean Sections in the United States

In recent years, obstetricians in the United States have shown a sudden keen interest in "cesarean sections," leading to a sharp increase in the proportion of women undergoing this procedure. In 1970, the cesarean section rate in the United States was only 7% of all births. By 1980, this had risen to 15%, and now, one in every four newborns is delivered by cesarean section. The high rate is puzzling.

If one were to say that American women are willing to undergo cesarean sections, it would be a gross misrepresentation. A young mother from New Jersey provides a clear example: "Neither of my children showed any signs of needing a cesarean section, yet the doctor insisted on it both times. I had no choice but to refuse."

So, what is the reason behind the sudden increase in cesarean sections in the United States? John Graham, an expert from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, explains, "The equipment used to monitor fetal heartbeats is not ideal. If there is any uncertainty, doctors opt for a cesarean section."

However, those with a keen eye know that this is not the real issue. The true reason is that the doctors responsible for deliveries are afraid of lawsuits.

It turns out that, according to U.S. law, if the parents of a newborn discover any abnormalities in their child that could be related to injuries sustained during delivery, they have the right to sue the doctor. In cases where the parents win, the compensation they receive is tax-free and can amount to as much as $7 million. The parents' defense lawyers also benefit, often receiving half of the compensation. Therefore, lawyers have a special fondness for such cases.

From delivery to the courtroom, this unfortunate situation has left obstetricians scratching their heads. Every delivery is a potential lawsuit.

It is reported that 70% of doctors in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have been sued at least once. Therefore, doctors have taken to choosing the safer option during deliveries: cesarean sections. John Graham notes, "I have never heard of a doctor being sued for performing too many cesarean sections."

Experts believe that at least half of the cesarean sections performed in the United States are inexplicable.

Facing this phenomenon, New York State recently established a committee of 25 experts to investigate hospitals with high cesarean section rates and declare "war" on the overuse of cesarean sections.

New York State authorities hope to set an example for the rest of the country by reducing the cesarean section rate to 10%. However, many people are skeptical about the effectiveness of this measure, as "officials and legislators are often lawyers."

### 美国剖腹产何其多

    美国剖腹产何其多
    近年来，美国的接生大夫们突然对“剖腹产”发生浓厚兴趣，以至美国产妇挨刀切的比例直线上升。一九七零年，美国的剖腹产比例只占产妇总数的百分之七，一九八零年，便上升到百分之十五，而今，在每四个新生儿中，便有一个是剖腹产而生。比例之高，令人不解。
    如果说美国的产妇愿意剖腹产，那着实冤枉。有新泽西州一位年轻母亲的微词为证：“我的两个孩子出生时，从未有过需要剖腹产的征兆，可是，医生两次都要剖腹产，我不得不拒绝。”
    那么，美国剖腹产急剧增加的原因何在呢？美国产科学院的专家约翰·格雷厄姆的解释是，“监测胎儿心脏跳动的仪器不理想。稍没把握，医生便选择剖腹产。”
    然而，明眼人却知道这并非问题的真正所在。真正的原因是，负责接生的医生们害怕“吃官司”。
    原来，按照美国法律，新生儿的家长如果发现孩子有异常现象，而这异常又可能与分娩过程中受过的创伤有关时，便有权上告法庭，追究医生的责任。家长在胜诉情况下得到的赔偿款无需上税，而赔偿款有时高达七百万美元。家长的辩护律师自然也可分肥，赔偿款的半数可流进律师的腰包。因此，律师对这种诉讼案有着特殊的偏爱。
    始于接生、了于法庭。这种倒霉事令接生大夫们伤透脑筋。每次接生都是一场“潜在的官司”。
    据悉，美国产科学院百分之七十的大夫都至少吃过一次官司。于是，大夫们在接生时，便纷纷选择明哲保身的作法：剖腹产。约翰·格雷厄姆对此下的注脚是，“从未听说医生因滥用剖腹产而吃官司的。”
    专家认为，在美国的剖腹产中，至少半数是根本解释不通的。
    面对此种现象，美国纽约州最近成立了一个由二十五位专家组成的委员会，对本州剖腹产比例偏高的医院进行检查，向剖腹产的泛滥“宣战”。
    纽约州当局希望在这方面成为全美国的“典范”，使剖腹产比例降到百分之十。但此举能否奏效，不少人持怀疑态度。因为，“官员和议员们都是律师”。
