	There is Cohesion Here
	Nian Wei Jia Hu Jun Hua

	“In such a harsh environment, being able to unite the cadres and soldiers into a cohesive force to build a modern warehouse fully demonstrates the power of the party committee. From this leadership team, I feel there is a tremendous cohesive force…” This is what an experienced old general said after inspecting the logistics warehouse of the Jinan Military Region. He was deeply moved.

	This warehouse has a history of over 20 years, located in a remote mountainous area. “Look up and see mountains, look down and see stones. The soil is like gold, and the water is like oil.” To this day, difficulties in transportation, water supply, vegetable supply, and watching television still plague this warehouse. Newly assigned comrades all have a sense of unease. However, the party committee of the warehouse believes: although poor mountains and bad water cannot hold people back, the exemplary role of Communist Party members can move people and keep them here.

	This warehouse has been in operation for over 20 years, but the leaders still live in temporary barracks built during the warehouse's construction. The barracks, made of stones and mud, often leak and are very damp. The political commissar's family member contracted rheumatoid arthritis due to this. The management department allocated some funds from production and operations to build a chief's building, and a site was selected. However, when the plan was submitted to the party committee for discussion, it was rejected. The party committee members believed that the soldiers' living conditions were not very good either. We should carry forward the party's fine tradition of caring for the people and first improve the soldiers' housing conditions. The party committee used this money to build a dormitory for the soldiers, allowing all soldiers to live in new rooms. The soldiers were moved and said: With such a leadership team, no matter how bitter and difficult the mountain valley is, we are willing to work hard.

	The party committee members rarely pay attention to their own family affairs, but they always keep the soldiers' well-being in mind. Soldier Li Shengliang contracted hemorrhagic fever and was sent to the county hospital in the garrison area. The warehouse director and political commissar visited him twice in one week. An elderly retired cadre suffered from high blood pressure and urgently needed treatment in Jinan. In the absence of a vehicle, the warehouse political commissar, Qiu Yiyang, spent 500 yuan to rent a car and personally sent him to Jinan, ensuring that the retired cadre received timely treatment.

	People say the biggest difficulty in this warehouse is the transportation. But the party committee members have a bright road in their hearts. Over the years, the party committee members have led all the cadres and soldiers to move 50,000 cubic meters of soil and stones, haul 40,000 cubic meters of sand, and quarry 20,000 cubic meters of stones. They built a 5-kilometer-long camp road by themselves. They also built a mink farm, a poultry farm, a stone material factory, and other facilities through self-reliance. The stone material factory alone can generate an annual profit of over 400,000 yuan. They built soldiers' dormitories, cultural halls, and installed closed-circuit televisions, fundamentally improving the soldiers' material and cultural lives.

    这里有凝集力
    年维佳　胡君华
    “在这样坚苦的环境中，能把干部战士拧成一股劲，建设现代化仓库，这充分证明了党委的力量。从这个班子里，我觉得有股巨大的聚集力……”这是一位身经百战的老将军视察了济南军区后勤某仓库时，深有感触说的一段话。
    这个仓库已有20多年的历史，地处偏僻的山区，“抬头见山头，低头见石头，土似金，水如油。”至今行路难、吃水难、吃菜难、看电视难困扰着这个仓库。刚刚分配到这里的同志心里都有种心绪不定的感觉。但仓库党委“一班人”却认为：穷山恶水虽拴不住人，可共产党员的模范带头作用却能感动人，留住人。
    这个仓库建库20多年，可是库领导依然住着建库时的临时工棚，用石块和泥沙垒起来的工棚，经常漏雨，也很潮湿，政委家属因此而患上了关节炎病。管理处从生产经营中抽出一部分钱，准备给常委盖一幢首长楼，选好了地皮，可是方案提交党委讨论时被否定了。党委“一班人”认为，战士们居住也不算太好，我们应该发扬党的关心群众的优良作风，首先改善战士们的住房条件。党委用这笔款为战士们盖了一幢宿舍楼，让所有战士都住上了新房，战士们感动地说：有这样的领导班子，山沟再苦、再难，我们也心甘情愿地干下去。
    党委“一班人”很少留意自己家的事，而战士们的温暖他们却时刻挂在心上。战士李圣良得出血热病被送到驻地县医院，仓库主任、政委曾在一个星期内两次抽出时间去医院探望他。有位离休老干部因患血压高，急需送到济南治疗。在没有车的情况下，仓库政委邱以旺花了500元钱租车亲自送他到济南，使这位离休老干部得到了及时治疗。
    人们说这个仓库最大困难是行路难。但党委“一班人”心中确有一条光明大路。几年来，党委“一班人”带领全库干部战士运土石5万多立方米，拉沙4万多立方米，采石2万多立方米，自己动手建起了一条长达5公里的营区公路。自力更生建起了养貂场、养鸡场、石料厂等。仅石料厂一项，就可年赢利40多万元。建起了士兵楼，文化厅，安装了闭路电视，使战士们的物质文化生活出现了根本好转。
