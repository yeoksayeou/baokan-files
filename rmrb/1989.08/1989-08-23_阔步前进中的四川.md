The 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a time for the people of Sichuan, along with the rest of the nation, to reflect on the glorious journey they have undertaken under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The achievements in socialist construction are immense. Today, as we celebrate the great victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the significance of marking the 40th anniversary of our nation's founding is even greater.

In the old society, Sichuan was mired in severe feudal fragmentation and warlord conflicts, leaving the people in dire poverty. After liberation, the people of Sichuan, from all ethnic groups, became masters of the state. Under the Party's leadership, they completed the great transition from the new democratic revolution to socialism. They have effectively carried out large-scale socialist modernization, transforming the old landscape and building a new Sichuan, profoundly changing the face of the land of abundance.

	• In a province that was once almost entirely agricultural, a modern industrial system with a relatively complete range of industries and considerable strength has been established. Today, Sichuan has a presence in all 38 major industrial sectors nationwide. In fields such as machinery, electronics, metallurgy, chemicals, and defense, Sichuan holds an important position nationally. By the end of last year, the total value of fixed assets in the province's state-owned industrial enterprises ranked second in the country, and the proportion of industry in the economy has risen from 16% at the time of liberation to 67%.

	• Agricultural production has seen significant development. Traditional self-sufficient agriculture is transforming into commercial agriculture, making Sichuan a major production base for several important agricultural and sideline products. Sichuan leads the nation in the production of grain, rapeseed, tung oil, silkworm cocoons, citrus, and medicinal herbs, as well as in the number of pigs slaughtered. Thanks to the development of agriculture, Sichuan, with only 1/16 of the nation's arable land, has basically ensured the needs of 1/10 of the national population for agricultural and sideline products. It has also exported large quantities of grain, pigs, timber, and other products to support national construction.

	• Transportation has developed rapidly. Since liberation, railways have gone from non-existent to a network of 6 main lines and 14 branch lines. Civil aviation, inland waterway transport, and urban and rural road networks have greatly changed the old image of "Shu Dao Nan" (difficult roads in Sichuan).

	• Science and technology, as well as education, have made remarkable progress. Before liberation, the province had only two research institutions and four specialized stations and bureaus, with fewer than 200 researchers. Now, there are over 600 research institutions at various levels, with more than 30,000 researchers, many of whom are high-level scientists working on cutting-edge technologies. The education sector has also seen significant development, cultivating a large number of talents for socialist construction.

	• Foreign trade and economic and technological cooperation have entered a new phase. While adhering to the state's unified foreign trade policy, Sichuan has developed direct import and export business and the use of foreign capital. It has established trade and economic cooperation relations with over 80 countries and regions. Sichuan is stepping onto the global stage, and the world is beginning to recognize Sichuan.

	• The living standards of the people have improved significantly. After liberation, the people of Sichuan freed themselves from the brutal exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class and embarked on the socialist path to common prosperity. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, people's incomes and living standards have improved markedly. For the vast majority, the days of not having enough to eat are over. The 100 million people of Sichuan are transitioning from a state of basic sustenance to one of moderate prosperity.

Forty years is but a brief moment in the long river of human history. Why have such tremendous changes occurred in these 40 years? This is mainly because the people of Sichuan have adhered to the Party's leadership, followed the socialist path, and carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. Especially in the past decade, they have adhered to the policy of reform and opening up.

Sichuan's economic foundation is weak. During the 40 years of construction, the state, at different times, especially during the "Third Front" construction period, concentrated considerable financial and material resources in Sichuan for large-scale construction. Without the socialist system based on the public ownership of the means of production, the liberation of productive forces and the rational development of natural resources and the economy in a planned and step-by-step manner would not have been possible. The people of Sichuan have deeply felt in practice that only socialism can save China and revitalize China.

The 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee have been the fastest and best period of economic development since liberation, and the period in which the people have benefited the most. This is mainly because the people of Sichuan, while adhering to the four cardinal principles, have resolutely followed the path of reform and opening up designed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to strengthen the country. Sichuan was a major disaster area during the Cultural Revolution. After the Gang of Four was smashed, the people eagerly wanted to change the backward situation. Therefore, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's policy of reform and opening up was enthusiastically supported by the 100 million people of Sichuan, who actively participated in this surging tide. Through reform, the socialist system has been further improved, promoting the development of productive forces.

Over the past 40 years, Sichuan's construction has achieved unprecedented successes that no other 40-year period in history can match. However, compared to other provinces and municipalities, there is still a considerable gap, and the requirements of the central government and the State Council are still far from being met. The difficulties facing future development are also not few. But we have confidence that we can overcome these difficulties. We will definitely follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's requirements, calmly reflect on the past, continue what is right, and work harder on what is lacking to catch up. At the same time, we will calmly consider the future, stand on a new historical starting point, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, firmly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, comprehensively and accurately, and consistently adhere to the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," rely on our own efforts, work hard, and strive for new victories in Sichuan's socialist material and spiritual civilization construction.

    阔步前进中的四川
    中共四川省委书记　杨汝岱
    社会主义的中华人民共和国成立40周年了。四川人民同全国人民一道，在中国共产党的领导下，走过了这一段光辉的历程，取得了社会主义建设事业的巨大成就。在取得平息北京反革命暴乱伟大胜利的今天，庆祝建国40周年这一光辉节日，更有重大意义。
    在旧社会，四川长期处于严重的封建割据和军阀混战之中，人民群众贫困不堪。解放后，四川各族人民翻身成了国家的主人，在党的领导下，完成了新民主主义到社会主义的伟大转变，卓有成效地进行了大规模的社会主义现代化建设，改造旧山河，建设新四川，使天府之国的面貌发生了深刻变化。
    ——在一个基本没有现代工业的农业省，建成了门类比较齐全、有较强实力的现代工业体系。如今，全国38个主要工业部门，四川都有，其中机械、电子、冶金、化工、军工等，在全国还占有重要地位。到去年底，全省全民所有制工业企业拥有固定资产原值已居全国第二位，工业在工农业中的比重，已由解放初的16％上升到67％。
    ——农业生产得到较大发展，自给自足的传统农业正在转变成为商品性农业，成了全国一些重要农副产品的生产基地。粮食、油菜、油桐、蚕茧、柑桔、中药材的产量和生猪出栏数，均位居全国之首。由于农业生产的发展，四川不仅以全国1／16的耕地基本保证了全国1／10人口对农副产品的需要，还调出大量粮食、生猪、木材等，支援了国家建设。
    ——交通事业发展迅速。解放以来，铁路从无到有，全省共建成6条铁路干线和14条支线；民用航空、内河航运、城乡公路网的建设，大大改变了“蜀道难”的旧貌。
    ——科技教育事业突飞猛进。解放前，全省仅有两个科研机构和4个专业站、所，科研人员不过200人。现在，已有各级科研机构600多个，科研人员3万多人，其中不少是担负研究尖端技术重任的高级科研人员。教育事业也有较大发展，培养出了一大批社会主义建设人才。
    ——对外贸易和经济技术合作出现新局面。在服从国家统一外贸的同时，四川先后开展了直接进出口业务和直接利用外资的工作。现已同80多个国家和地区建立了贸易和经济协作关系。四川正在走向世界，世界已开始认识四川。
    ——人民生活水平普遍提高。解放后，四川人民摆脱了反动统治阶级的残酷剥削和压迫，走上了共同富裕的社会主义道路。特别是党的十一届三中全会以后，人民收入和生活水平显著提高。对绝大多数人来说，那种不得温饱的境况已经成为过去，一亿四川人民正在由“温饱型”向小康型过渡。
    40年，在人类历史长河中仅是短暂的一瞬。为什么这40年能发生如此巨大的变化呢？这主要是由于四川人民坚持了党的领导，坚持走社会主义道路，坚持发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，特别是近10年来坚持了改革开放的总方针。
    四川经济基础差。在40年的建设中，国家在不同时期，特别是“三线”建设时期，集中了相当的财力和物力，在四川大规模投资搞建设。而这没有以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义制度对生产力的解放和有计划、有步骤地合理开发自然资源，发展经济，是不可能实现的。四川人民在实践中深深体会到，只有社会主义才能救中国、才能振兴中国。
    十一届三中全会以后的10年，是四川解放以来，经济发展最快最好、人民群众所得实惠最多的时期，这主要是由于四川人民在坚持四项基本原则的前提下，坚决走小平同志为我们设计的改革、开放的强国之路的结果。四川是“文革”的重灾区，粉碎“四人帮”后，人民群众迫切要求改变落后面貌，因此，小平同志提出的改革、开放政策得到了四川一亿人民的衷心拥护，人民积极投入这一滚滚洪流中。通过改革，使社会主义制度得到进一步完善，促进了生产力的发展。
    40年来，四川的建设虽然取得了以往历史上任何一个40年都无法比拟的巨大成就，但同兄弟省市相比，还有相当的差距，离中央和国务院的要求还很远。今后发展面临的困难也还不少。但我们有信心，能够克服困难。我们一定按照小平同志的要求，冷静地思考过去，做得对的继续发扬，不足的加把劲，努力赶上去。同时也冷静地考虑未来，在新的历史起点上，在党中央、国务院的正确领导下，坚定不移地贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，全面准确、一以贯之地坚持党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，夺取四川社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设的新胜利。
