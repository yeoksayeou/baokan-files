The author of this book has dedicated himself to the study of ancient Chinese characters, a journey marked by diligence and perseverance over more than a decade. His initial foray into the field began with the "Shuowen Jiezi" (Explaining Graphs and Analyzing Characters), from which he delved into oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, and further explored pre-Qin classics. His efforts have been meticulous and extensive.

Given his solid foundation in ancient literature, the author has conducted in-depth observations and reflections on the evolution of ancient Chinese characters. He has also collected a vast amount of ancient character data, drawing on the strengths of various schools of thought to develop his own set of methodologies. Through persistent effort, he has successfully deciphered a batch of oracle bone inscriptions. The book presents over fifty of these newly interpreted oracle bone characters.

This monograph offers new interpretations of many difficult characters and employs unique methods of decipherment. While the book primarily focuses on the identification of individual characters, it also emphasizes the exploration of their origins and usage. Additionally, it delves into the historical and cultural context of the Shang Dynasty, aiming to address some of the issues in Shang Dynasty studies. The book holds significant academic value.

    作者从事古文字研究走着一条艰苦的道路，十多年来刻苦钻研，致力颇多。他最初从《说文》入手渐治卜辞金文，旁及先秦典籍，用功甚勤。由于他在古文献方面具有扎实的根底，对古文字的源流变迁做了深入的观察思考，并搜集了大量的古文字资料，广泛吸取诸家之长，形成自己的一套法则。经过长期锲而不舍的努力，现已新释出一批甲骨文。本书所释的五十多个甲骨文就是这些成果中的一部分。
    这部专著新释读出不少疑难字，释读方法也有独到之处。此书固以单字辨识为主，注重字源及用法的探索，但同时也注意开掘卜辞史料，探讨商代的历史文化，以解决商史研究中的一些问题，具有重要的学术价值。    （王先时）
