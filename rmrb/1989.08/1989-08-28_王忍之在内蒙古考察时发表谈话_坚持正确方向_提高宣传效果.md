Wang Renzhi, the head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke to the heads of the propaganda departments in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region on August 22. He emphasized that the ideological front must combine a firm and correct political direction with efforts to improve propaganda effectiveness, and carry out various tasks in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

From August 17 to 22, Wang Renzhi conducted a six-day inspection tour in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. He said that during the recent turmoil and counterrevolutionary riots in some parts of the country, including Beijing, the propaganda front in Inner Mongolia had performed well. Practice has proven that this team is qualified.

Wang Renzhi said that the current tasks facing the propaganda departments and the ideological front are very arduous. Work must be done in accordance with the "Notice on Strengthening Propaganda and Ideological Work" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Now that the turmoil and riots have been suppressed, there are still many misconceptions among some people, and a great deal of painstaking and detailed work needs to be done. We must have a clear understanding of this. The ideological issues reflected in this turmoil and riot are the result of the rampant bourgeois liberalization. Through the cleanup of the bourgeois liberalization reflected in the turmoil and riots, we must make people believe that only the Communist Party can lead us to build a prosperous, civilized, and democratic socialist China, thereby gradually solving various ideological issues from shallow to deep. Do not underestimate the significance of guiding people to correctly understand the essence of this incident and the correctness of the central government's decisions. Once this issue is resolved, many specific issues will be easier to address. Therefore, uniting the understanding of the turmoil and riots with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech is a major task that will have a significant impact on future long-term work.

Wang Renzhi emphasized in his speech that propaganda work must effectively combine the establishment of a firm and correct political direction with efforts to improve propaganda effectiveness. The first priority in propaganda work is to have a firm and correct political direction, to do a good job in accordance with the Party's line, principles, and policies, and to adhere to one central task and two fundamental points. If there are problems in this area, everything will go wrong. On the other hand, if the art of propaganda is not valued, it will not have the desired effect. The propaganda departments, theoretical circles, news media, and literary and artistic circles all have the task of both adhering to a firm and correct political direction and being able to attract and educate the masses, and this task must be solved well.

Wang Renzhi stressed that improving the overall environment must be combined with strengthening grassroots party building and ideological and political work. He said that if there are problems with news guidance, theoretical propaganda, and literary and artistic propaganda, grassroots units will be affected. Efforts must be made to improve the overall environment and atmosphere, and the news, propaganda, and other public opinion fronts must provide the people and society with good and healthy spiritual products. At the same time, grassroots party building and ideological and political work must also be done well.

Wang Renzhi pointed out that unity and reliance on intellectuals, and the full play of their role, cannot be shaken. We should believe that the vast majority of intellectuals support the Party and socialism, and only a very small number of people stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance. Some intellectuals have been influenced by bourgeois liberalization and erroneous theories, which is a matter of ideological understanding. Through education, help, and their own reflection, they will be able to get rid of the erroneous influence. We believe that the vast majority of intellectuals will play a major role in achieving the Four Modernizations and building socialism with Chinese characteristics. However, those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engage in conspiracies must not be tolerated. Tolerating them does not serve the interests of the Party and the people, and ultimately does not serve the interests of the vast majority of intellectuals. We must resolutely implement the Party's policy of uniting and relying on intellectuals. During this turmoil and riot, some scoundrels in the intellectual circle plotted behind the scenes and incited in front, playing a very bad role, and they cannot represent the vast majority of Chinese intellectuals.

Wang Renzhi said that we must care for and cherish intellectuals. We should advocate that intellectuals go to practice, understand life, understand the masses, and understand the national conditions of China. This is also a way of caring for and trusting intellectuals. This point was not emphasized much in the past, but it should be strongly advocated in the future.

    王忍之在内蒙古考察时发表谈话
    坚持正确方向　提高宣传效果
    据新华社北京8月28日电  中共中央宣传部部长王忍之8月22日在对内蒙古自治区宣传部门负责人讲话中强调，思想战线要把坚持坚定正确的政治方向同努力提高宣传效果结合起来，按照党的十三届四中全会精神做好各项工作。
    8月17日至22日，王忍之到内蒙古自治区作了为期6天的考察。他说，这次来内蒙古总的印象是，在这次全国部分地区发生动乱和北京发生反革命暴乱事件中，内蒙古宣传口的各条战线表现是好的。实践证明，这支队伍是合格的。
    王忍之说，当前，宣传部门和思想战线面临的任务十分繁重，要按照中共中央《关于加强宣传、思想工作的通知》做好工作。现在动乱和暴乱平息了，但在一部分群众中还存在不少模糊认识，需要做大量艰苦细致的工作。对此，要有清醒的认识。这次动乱、暴乱中反映出来的思想问题，是资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的结果。要通过对动乱、暴乱中反映出来的资产阶级自由化思潮造成的恶果的清理，让人们相信只有共产党才能领导我们建设富强、文明、民主的社会主义中国，从而使各种思想问题由浅入深地逐步得到解决。不要小看引导人们正确认识这次事件的实质、认识中央决策正确性的意义。这方面的认识问题解决了，许多具体的认识问题也就好解决了。因此，把对动乱、暴乱的认识统一到四中全会精神和小平同志讲话精神上来，是一项对今后长期工作有重大影响的任务。
    王忍之在讲话中强调，宣传工作要把树立坚定正确的政治方向和努力提高宣传效果很好地结合起来。宣传工作第一位的是要有坚定正确的政治方向，按照党的路线、方针、政策做好工作，坚持一个中心、两个基本点。在这方面出了问题，就会一错百错。另一方面，如果不重视宣传艺术，也起不到应有的作用。宣传部门、理论界、新闻界、文艺界都有一个既坚持坚定正确的政治方向、又能够吸引群众、教育群众的课题，一定要努力解决好。
    王忍之强调，要把改善大的环境同加强基层党的建设和思想政治工作结合起来。他说，新闻导向、理论宣传、文艺宣传如果出了问题，基层单位就会受到冲击。要着力搞好大的环境、大的气候，新闻、宣传等舆论战线都要为人民、为社会提供好的健康的精神产品。同时，也要做好基层党的建设和思想政治工作。
    王忍之指出，团结、依靠知识分子，充分发挥知识分子的作用，这一点不能有任何动摇。我们应该相信，绝大多数知识分子是拥护党、拥护社会主义的，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的只是极少数人。有些知识界人士受到资产阶级自由化和错误理论的影响，这是个思想认识问题，经过教育帮助和他们自己的思考，是会摆脱错误影响的。我们相信广大知识分子在实现四个现代化，建设有中国特色的社会主义的过程中会发挥重大作用。但是，对顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞阴谋的人，绝不能姑息纵容。对他们姑息纵容，不仅不符合党和人民的利益，最终也不符合广大知识分子的利益。我们要坚决执行党的团结、依靠知识分子的政策。在这次动乱和暴乱中知识界的一些败类幕后策划、台前煽动，起了极坏的作用，他们根本不能代表中国广大知识分子。
    王忍之说，要关心和爱护知识分子。提倡知识分子到实践中去，了解生活，了解群众，了解中国的国情，这也是对知识分子的一种爱护和信任。这一点前些年讲得不多，今后要大力提倡。
