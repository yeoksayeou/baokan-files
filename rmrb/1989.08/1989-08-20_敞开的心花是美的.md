One night during the Islamic "Jumu'ah" (Friday prayer), I attended a wedding rich in ethnic characteristics.

The groom, Zhang Xiaohua, is a Hui Muslim from Dacamp Village in the high-altitude region of Songming County, Yunnan Province. The bride, Cai Jinju, is a beautiful Han woman from the neighboring Longyuan Village.

At the wedding banquet, the elders of the Hui community spoke with ease and humor, the young men and women smiled sweetly like "golden lotus" (a symbol of good fortune and happiness in Hui regions), the imam's voice was clear as he recited the "nikah" (marriage contract), and the Hui people's joyful voices as they offered the Han family "youcha" (a tea made from mixing buckwheat and glutinous rice flour, then frying with beef or mutton oil) created a unique festive atmosphere.

Dacamp and Longyuan have been connected by land and water for generations, each with over 500 households. However, one side is Hui, and the other is Han; one side follows Islam, and the other follows Buddhism. According to the elders, over the past hundred years, the two villages have had several clashes due to ethnic differences, leading to grudges. After liberation, with the implementation of the Party's ethnic policies, the relationship between the two villages gradually improved, and conflicts gradually eased. However, unexpectedly, between 1981 and 1982, the two villages had two more significant clashes, leading the provincial, municipal, and county governments to send work teams to mediate and calm the situation. At that time, the village cadres did their best to promote unity, educating their own ethnic groups to solve their problems. With the help of the work teams, it was difficult to finally allocate over 100 acres of land originally belonging to the Hui village to Dacamp. The storm gradually subsided, but people's hearts took a long time to calm down.

For such two villages with a history of enmity to have inter-ethnic marriages, outsiders would not believe it in their dreams, but it is indeed true.

"This is indeed true. In recent years, the two villages have had 12 pairs of Hui and Han young men and women who have happily tied the knot!" The next morning, I sat in the bright and clean new room of Chen Xuekuan, the director of the Dacamp Office, a Hui and a Communist Party member. He happily told me. I was puzzled and asked him to tell me the story.

He lit a cigarette and laughed happily, "This matter is complicated if you want to say it is. The history of discord between the two villages is at least a hundred years old; but if you want to say it is simple, it is the Party's policy of enriching the people that has brought about the unity of Hui and Han. The elders all say that the historical clashes were mostly due to 'poverty,' fighting over land, water, and grain; the two clashes over land between 1981 and 1982 were also due to 'poverty.' In those years, this place was known as the 'pocket village' in the county, with one work point worth 1.3 fen, spending money relying on loans, and eating grain relying on returns. After 1983, with the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, everyone's life became better day by day. In addition to farming, most of the Hui in Dacamp took advantage of the local conditions to start fur trading, accumulating 250,000 yuan to build the second-largest fur trading market in Yunnan Province, with a daily turnover of over 300,000 yuan; most of the Han in Longyuan developed fur, mountain products transportation, construction, and planting flowers and fruits, with grain surplus every year, an annual per capita income of over 400 yuan, 80% of the people built new houses, and purchased cars, tricycles, tractors, motorcycles, televisions, and tape recorders.

Life became richer, and everyone's hearts became broader, thinking further ahead. Everyone voluntarily contributed to build irrigation canals, open paddy fields, build schools, and pave roads. In these common public welfare activities, the two ethnic groups interacted more frequently. Every year during the two planting and harvesting seasons, the Hui lacked labor, and Longyuan Village sent nearly 100 people every day to help the Hui manage the fields; when the Hui needed to transport furs or build houses, as long as they sent a message, the Han farmers would come to support them; when spring drought or autumn floods occurred, some households in Longyuan lacked grain, and the Hui would actively carry grain to their doors. In the past two years, Hui and Han young men and women have also invited each other to go to the market, learn culture and skills, sing and dance; the elders have also visited each other, drunk sugared tea, and talked business... Under such circumstances, the phenomenon of inter-ethnic marriages, which has never happened in history, also appeared, which is not surprising! Ha, ha..."

Bidding farewell to Old Chen, I walked on the new and clean village road, with the young people's laughter and joy carried by the gentle breeze. I couldn't help but think of a proverb: An open heart is beautiful. I silently wished that the hearts of the Hui and Han people in Dacamp and Longyuan would bloom more beautifully and beautifully under the spring breeze of reform.

    敞开的心花是美的
    丁峻
    一个伊斯兰教“主麻日”的夜晚，我参加了一个极富民族特色的婚礼。
    新郎是云南省嵩明县高寒山区大营村回族张小华，新娘名叫蔡金菊，是紧连着的龙院村的一位秀美的汉族姑娘。
    婚礼席上，回族老人们舒心风趣的谈吐，姑娘伙子们那“金盏花”（回族地区一种金色的象征吉祥幸福的花）一般甜的笑脸，阿訇念“米柯罕”（即喜经）的清朗之声，回民向汉家敬油茶（一种用荞麦面与糯米面掺拌后，用牛羊油炒出来的茶）的欢快之声，汇成了这次婚宴的特有的喜庆气氛。
    大营和龙院自古土地连接、山水相依，都是拥有500多户人家的大村，但一边是回民，一边是汉家；一边信奉伊斯兰教，一边信奉佛教。据老辈人回忆，近百年来，两村人因为民族间隔阂，曾多次发生械斗，结下冤仇。解放后，随着党的民族政策的落实，两村的关系逐步改善，矛盾日渐缓和。可是，不料想，1981年至1982年，两村又相继发生了两次规模较大的械斗，以至省、市、县派工作组来调解、平息。当时两村的干部尽量本着团结的愿望，教育本族群众，解决好自己的问题。在工作组的帮助下，好不容易才将原属回民村的100多亩地，划归了大营。风波渐渐平息下来了，然而人们心里好长时间宁静不下来。
    对这样两个有着村仇的回汉族人家通婚，外人是做梦也不敢相信的，但这毕竟是真的。
    “这的确是真的，近年来，两村已有12对回汉姑娘、小伙子喜结良缘呢！”第二天早晨，我坐在回民、大营办事处主任、共产党员陈学宽明亮整洁的新房里，他高兴地对我说。我迷惘了，请他把事情的根由讲给我听听。
    他点燃一支烟，开心地笑着说：“这事要说复杂，两村群众不和的历史至少上百年；要说简单，回汉一家亲是党的富民政策带来的。老人们都说，历史上的械斗，多半因为‘穷’，为争地、争水、争粮；1981年至1982年的两次为争土地发生的械斗，也是因为‘穷’。那些年，这儿是全县有名的‘口袋村’，一个工分值一角三分钱，花钱靠贷款，吃粮靠返销。1983年以后，随着联产承包责任制的落实，大家的日子一天比一天富裕起来，在栽田种地之余，大营的多数回民因地制宜地做起了皮毛生意，积资2.5万元，建起了云南省第二大皮毛交易市场，每天的成交额达30余万元；龙院的多数汉家开展了皮毛、山货运输、建筑施工、栽花种果等多种经营，粮食年年有余，年人均收入达400多元，80％的群众盖起了新房，购置了汽车、三轮车、拖拉机、摩托车、电视机、录音机等。
    生活富裕了，大家的心也宽了，想的也远了，大家自愿集资修水渠、开水田、建学校、铺车路。在这些共同的公益活动中，两族群众来往日益密切。每年栽插、收割二季，回民劳力缺乏，龙院村每天几乎都出动100多人帮回民管理农田；回民要运皮货、盖房屋，只要捎个口信，汉族农户便来支援；遇上春旱秋涝，龙院的一些农户缺粮，回民们便主动背着粮食送上门去。近两年来，回汉姑娘伙子们还相互邀约赶街，学文化技术，唱歌跳舞；老辈子人相互串门子、喝糖茶、谈生意……在这种情况下出现回汉两族通婚这种历史上从未有的现象，也就不足为奇罗！哈、哈……”
    辞别了老陈，我走在崭新光洁的村道上，缕缕清风吹送过来年轻人的欢声笑语。不由得我想起了一句谚语：敞开的心花是美的。我默默祝愿大营、龙院回汉群众的心花，在改革春风的吹拂下，越开越大，越开越美。
