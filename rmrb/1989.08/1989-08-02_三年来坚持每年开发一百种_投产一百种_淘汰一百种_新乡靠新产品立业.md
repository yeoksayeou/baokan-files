Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 2nd.

Over the past three years, New Xiang City in Henan Province has consistently developed 100 new products, produced 100 new products, and phased out over 100 old products each year. This approach has gradually established pillar industries led by high-quality products. From January to May this year, the city's total industrial output value and realized tax profits increased by 18.6% and 19.42% respectively compared to the same period last year.

New Xiang City is a medium-sized industrial city primarily focused on light textiles and electronics. Most of the city's industrial enterprises are small to medium-sized, with few advantageous products. The municipal Party committee and government, adhering to the guiding principle of "small factories can stand tall with good products," have consistently focused their efforts on technological upgrades of existing enterprises, with an emphasis on developing new products. Each year, two-thirds of the production funds are allocated to technological upgrade projects. Over the past three years, the city has developed 355 new products, phased out 311 old products, and completed nearly 100 technological upgrade projects. These efforts have added 500 million yuan in new output value, 1.2 billion yuan in new tax profits, and created over 40 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

To ensure the successful development of new products, New Xiang City meticulously compiles an annual new product development plan, with the municipal government overseeing the city's technological upgrades. The development of each new product, from the initial proposal, must undergo rigorous screening by a specialized agency and strict review by experts to ensure the plan's infallibility. Subsequently, the projects are implemented through a contracting system to ensure quality. Over the years, the city's new product development success rate has reached 100%, with an input-output ratio of 1:3. Many new products, such as refrigerators, color televisions, oxygen-free copper, and synthetic leather printing fabrics, have quickly become advantageous products, securing a significant market position in competitive markets.

    三年来坚持每年开发一百种  投产一百种  淘汰一百种
    新乡靠新产品立业
    本报郑州8月2日电　记者李杰报道：河南省新乡市三年来坚持每年开发100个新产品，投产100个新产品，淘汰100多个旧产品，逐步形成以优质产品为龙头的支柱产业。今年1至5月，全市工业总产值、实现税利分别比去年同期增长18.6％和19.42％。
    新乡市是一个以轻纺和电子工业为主的中等工业城市，市属工业大多是中小企业，优势产品不多。市委、市政府本着“厂不在小，产品好才能立业”的指导思想，几年来始终把主要精力放在以开发新产品为导向的对现有企业的技术改造上，每年都把2／3的生产资金用于技术改造项目。自1986年以来的三年中，全市开发新产品355个，淘汰旧产品311种，完成与此相配套的技术改造项目近百项。仅此，全市新增产值5亿元，新增税利1.2亿多元，多创外汇4000多万美元。
    为把开发新产品落到实处，新乡市每年都精心编制全年新产品开发计划，由市政府统揽全市技改的全局。开发每个新产品，从立项开始都必须经过专设机构的反复筛选和专家的严格论证，求得方案上的万无一失。然后，以承包的方式落实到项目承包人，确保项目的质量。几年来，这个市新产品开发的成功率达到100％，投入产出比达到1∶3。许多新产品如电冰箱、彩电、无氧铜、人造革印染布等，很快成为优势产品，在市场竞争中占有相当的位置。
