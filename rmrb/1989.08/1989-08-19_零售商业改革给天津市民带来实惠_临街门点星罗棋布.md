    Retail business reform has brought convenience to the people of Tianjin in recent years. According to incomplete statistics, the city has established nearly 30,000 new retail outlets. These small and medium-sized stores, scattered throughout the city, include grain and oil, food, and general merchandise stores that provide daily necessities to consumers, as well as newly renovated cultural, book, and audio-visual specialty stores.

    In January of last year, the Tianjin municipal government accelerated the reform of the retail business system. Six retail industries closely related to people's lives—department stores, vegetables and food, catering, services, repairs, and confectionery—were all transferred to the districts. Instead of being managed by the bureau, municipal companies, and district companies in layers, they are now directly managed by the districts. After the retail business was transferred to the districts, it broke away from the old management model. Personnel, finances, and materials are now managed by the districts, which has mobilized the enthusiasm of each district to organize people's lives. These small business outlets have utilized their advantages, paid attention to filling gaps, and ensured a variety of small commodities and complete varieties, making it convenient for residents to shop.

    The transfer has also quickly solved the long-standing problem of supply difficulties in remote areas. New residential areas such as Wanxin Village and Wangdingdi have formed self-contained shopping districts, and residents praise this as another good deed by the government to care for the people's lives.

    Tianjin's price increase index is at the lowest level in the country. In addition to the government's effective measures to stabilize prices, it is also inseparable from the three-level price supervision network that covers the entire city. This team of more than ten thousand inspectors safeguards the interests of consumers. Thus, Tianjin residents, who have benefited from this, start praising the government for doing practical things for the people from their dining tables.

    零售商业改革给天津市民带来实惠
    临街门点星罗棋布
    本报讯　天津的老百姓这两年都感到，买东西方便多了。据不完全统计，目前全市新建的商业网点已近3万个。这些星罗棋布的中小商店中，既有为消费者提供日用商品的粮油、副食、百货的临街门点，也有装潢一新的文化、图书、音像专业商店。
    去年1月，天津市政府加快了零售商业体制改革。百货、蔬菜副食、饮食、服务、修配、糖果等6个与人民生活密切相关的零售行业全部下放到区，由过去局、市公司、区公司层层管理，改为由区直接统管。零售商业下放到区后，摆脱了旧的管理模式，人、财、物归区管理，调动了各区组织人民生活的积极性，打破了过去那种死气沉沉的局面。这些小商业网点，利用自己的优势，注意拾遗补缺，做到小商品花色多、品种全，便利了居民购买。
    下放，使多年难以解决的边远区供应困难也迅速得到解决。万新村、王顶堤等新建居民区形成了一个个功能齐全的购物小区，市民们称赞这是政府关心群众生活的又一善举。
    天津的物价上涨指数处于全国最低水平，除了市政府稳定物价措施得力外，还与触角遍布全市的三级物价监督网络分不开，这支拥有万余人的检查队伍，维护着消费者的利益。于是，得到了实惠的天津人，从餐桌上就开始夸政府为民办实事了。　孙惠英　黎燕生
