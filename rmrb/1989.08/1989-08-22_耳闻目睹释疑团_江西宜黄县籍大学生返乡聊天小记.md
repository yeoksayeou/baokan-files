Since the summer vacation, more than 100 university students from Yiyang County in Jiangxi Province have returned home from Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. They often gather in groups of three or five to discuss their hometown, school life, and national affairs. Through the effectiveness of their hometown's anti-corruption efforts, they have dispelled the doubts in their minds.

We recorded one of their conversations:

“Every year they try to stop extravagant banquets, but every year it’s the same old story. Now it seems they are finally getting serious,” someone started the topic.

A student surnamed Liu responded, “I’m not so sure. They might stop openly, but they still do it in secret. Who can see that?”

“No, it’s not like that now,” said Huang Jianguo, a 23-year-old Ph.D. student from Fudan University, wearing wide-rimmed glasses. “My mother works in the county’s reception center kitchen. In the past, when I came home, I saw officials in the large and small dining halls of the reception center drinking like ‘Guans’ (a reference to Guan Yu, a famous warrior known for his bravery and love for wine). The floor was littered with empty bottles, melon rinds, and fruit peels. The annual reception expenses were as high as 500,000 yuan. The pigs in the center ate better than the common people. This year is different. The county’s leaders have taken the lead in implementing the regulations to stop extravagant banquets, setting an example by eating simple meals when they go to the countryside and not entertaining guests when higher-ups come. According to Xiao Huang, the reception expenses for the first half of the year were reduced by 76% compared to the same period last year, and the county saved more than 200,000 yuan in the first six months alone by stopping extravagant banquets.”

“The results are quite obvious,” a student interjected, “In the past, soft-shelled turtles cost more than 20 yuan per pound and were hard to buy. Now, they cost only 4 to 5 yuan per pound and have made it to the tables of ordinary people.”

Xiao Huang continued, “From what I can see, the various levels of government are indeed not as weak and powerless in resisting extravagant banquets and combating corruption as we have heard in school. Seeing is believing. There is hope for rectifying the party’s style.”

“Maybe the banquet problem will improve, but party and government officials still build private houses with their power, doing as they please,” some students still grumbled.

“On this issue, I have something to say,” said Yu Junlang, a student from Beijing Normal University who lives in the suburban area of the county. “For many years, I have been very disgusted with the ‘official village’ near my home. I despise those officials who rely on their power to build private houses illegally. This time when I returned home, my family and relatives told me that these people have been punished according to party and government regulations, and some have even been punished by law.”

“Maybe those few unlucky ones got caught, but the others are just criticized and then live comfortably for the rest of their lives,” someone else asked.

“I don’t see it that way,” Yu Junlang said. “From what I know, 90% of the party members and officials in the county, including those in the forestry area of Lixi Township, have not built private houses with their power in 15 years. This shows that a large number of party members and officials are upright. I think it’s time for us students to reflect. In the past, students believed that ‘the party is corrupt beyond redemption’ and other such statements, failing to see the mainstream of the party and government, leading to good patriotic wishes being exploited, and ultimately leading to blind participation in street protests, which was a painful lesson! Now, the ironclad facts make me completely believe that our party has the ability to effectively combat corruption and promote clean governance through democratic and legal channels.”

“Returning to the hometown and seeing and hearing for myself, I have deep feelings,” said Li Xiaorong, a graduate from Northeast Forestry University who lives in Huangpi Town. “Now, in our hometown, you can no longer see the couplet that says, ‘I won’t buy high-priced fertilizer, I won’t sell low-priced grain, don’t blame the government.’ Since this year, the town government has taken the supply of fertilizer as a political issue of whether the farmers trust the party and as a breakthrough for clean governance. They have seriously implemented the methods of public distribution, certificate issuance to households, and comprehensive supervision for exclusive operation.”

“Is it really that good? I’m skeptical. Those township officials won’t keep a few bags for personal favors?”

“Believe it or not, it’s up to you. Anyway, in our town, the nearly 40 tons of contract fertilizer and special fertilizer allocated in the first half of the year have all been distributed to households. The allocation situation has been layer by layer through the town’s radio station and the town and village blackboard newspapers. The town and village leaders have not issued a single note, nor have they raised a single cent. The farmers are all satisfied with this!”

“Honestly, I’m worried that it will be a storm from above and a drizzle from below. After the first day of the lunar month, the fifteenth will be different again,” a student surnamed Zhao said.

Li Xiaorong replied, “You can’t say that. Now the government has started off well. I believe that as long as every party member and official can start with themselves and be strict with themselves, our party will have hope, and our country will have a bright future.”

    耳闻目睹释疑团
    ——江西宜黄县籍大学生返乡聊天小记
    江西宜黄县委宣传部　鲁安　永灿
    暑假以来，从北京、上海、南京等地陆续回到家乡的100多名宜黄籍大学生，经常三五成群在一起议家乡、说校园、谈国事。他们透过家乡廉政建设的成效，驱散了心头的疑团。
    我们记录了其中的一段：
    “年年制止吃喝，年年边治边喝，现在总算开始动真的了”，不知谁先挑出了话题。
    一个姓刘的同学答道：“我看不一定，明里不吃，暗里吃，谁看得到？”
    “不，现在可不是这样。”戴着宽边眼镜的23岁的复旦大学博士研究生黄建国接过话题说：“我母亲是县委招待所炊事员。往年我回家，看到县招待所大小餐厅里干部个个喝得像‘关公’，酒瓶、瓜皮、果壳满地。一年招待费高达5万元。所里的猪吃得比百姓吃得还要好。今年不同了，县里各级领导带头执行有关制止吃喝风的规定，以身作则，下乡吃份餐，上级来人也不陪吃了。”据小黄了解，招待所上半年招待费比去年同期减少76％，6个月全县制止吃喝一项就节约资金20多万元。
    “效果是很明显”，有个同学插话说，“过去甲鱼20多元钱一斤还买不到，现在甲鱼一斤只要4至5元，已经爬上了一般群众的饭桌。”
    小黄接着又说：“现在看来，各级政府抵制吃喝，惩治腐败，确实不像我们在学校所听到的那样软弱无力。百闻不如一见，端正党风，是有希望的。”
    “也许吃喝问题会好点，可党政干部以权谋私建私房还不是我行我素。”有的同学依然忿忿不平。
    “这个问题我有发言权”，家住县城郊区的北京师范大学学生余俊浪说：“多年来我对家门附近的‘官府村’十分反感，我鄙视那些依仗权势违法乱纪营建私房的‘官老爷’。这次回家，家里人和亲友告诉我，这些人已分别受到党纪、政纪处分，有的甚至还受到法律制裁。”
    “可能那几个倒霉的是碰上了，其他人还不是批评一阵子舒服一辈子。”又有人反问道。
    “我倒不那样看，据我了解，全县90％的党员干部，还有地处林区的力溪乡干部，15年无一人以权谋私建私房。可见大批党员干部还是一身正气。我想现在该是我们同学们反思的时候了。过去同学们相信‘党腐败到无可救药的程度了’等说法，看不到党和政府的主流，导致良好的爱国愿望被人利用，最后盲目上了街头，教训实在惨痛！如今铁的事实使我完全相信我们的党有能力通过民主与法制的渠道，有效地惩治腐败，抓好廉政建设。”
    “回到家乡耳闻目睹，深有感触”，家在黄陂镇的北方林业大学毕业生李小荣接上话头：“现在在我们家乡‘高价肥料我不买，平价粮食我不卖，政府莫怪’的对联已看不到了。今年以来，镇政府把抓好化肥供应看成是全镇农民群众对党是否信任的政治问题，当作廉政的突破口认真抓好，采取分配公开、发证到户、全面监督的方法进行专营。”
    “真有那么好？我才怀疑呢，那些乡干部就不会私下留几包做个人情？”
    “信不信在你，反正我们镇上半年调进的近40吨挂钩化肥和专项化肥全部发放到户，并通过镇广播站和镇、村黑板报将分配情况层层分开，镇、村领导没批一张条子，没涨一分钱。农民对此都叫好呢！”
    “说实话，我真担心上面一阵雷，下面一阵雨，过了初一，十五又不一样”，一个姓赵的同学说。
    李小荣回答道：“话不能那么说，现在政府已开了个好头，我相信只要每个党员干部都能从我做起，严于律己，我们党就有希望，我们国家就前途无量。”
