Title: The Difficulties of Trade Wars, Resource Competition, and Price Control: A Reflection on Contemporary "Feudal Economics"

	Various macro-control measures often end up being half-hearted, with orders not being followed through. This is not entirely due to the mistakes of decision-makers.

	Frequent "trade wars," such as the "hemp war" and the "tea war," often originate from administrative border areas.

	Guangdong is short of grain and has to use a large amount of foreign exchange to import Thai rice, while Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have surplus rice piled up in their warehouses with nowhere to sell.

	These and other "abnormal" phenomena are related to the "feudal economic" structure that has already formed in our country.

	China's economic system reform began with reforming the highly centralized planning system to increase the autonomy and flexibility of local economic decision-making. However, the administrative decentralization from top to bottom, while increasing the enthusiasm of local governments, also led to a return to a quasi-centralized system where administrative interference in the economy is rampant. During the rectification and adjustment process, the allocation of price control indicators, the implementation of various monopolistic systems, and price control policies further exacerbated regional economic friction. The "feudal economy" has become a circle within a circle, making the open and active policies advocated since the reform difficult to implement, pushing China's economy towards a loose structure.

	The two most prominent features of the "feudal economy" are mutual trade barriers and resource competition.

	Regional trade barriers make the market's self-regulating mechanisms subordinate to administrative rules, increasing the risk of horizontal mergers between enterprises.

	Regional barriers increase the difficulty of market price control. Coastal developed regions block industrial consumer goods, causing dual pricing or price increases in other areas, leading to high retail prices in inland provinces. After experiencing the pain of industrial consumer goods blockades, raw material-producing provinces also have no choice but to adopt "strategies." Tolls and prohibition notices are everywhere, causing raw material and energy prices to rise and supply-demand contradictions to intensify. Although coastal provinces have sufficient financial resources to compete with inland regions for resources, they cannot break through the administrative intervention that has formed a separatist force. Because coastal provinces have lost control over raw material prices, they cannot stabilize product costs, leading to a cycle of price increases.

	Moreover, regional barriers make enterprises lose their flexibility, and administrative interference makes enterprises overly dependent on the government, causing the state to move slowly like a snail when delegating management authority.

	The "feudal economy" is a "monstrosity" born in the process of transition between old and new systems in China. It is completely at odds with the future unified commodity economic system.

### 贸易大战难息  资源争夺难禁  物价上涨难控  当代“诸侯经济”忧思录

    贸易大战难息  资源争夺难禁  物价上涨难控
    当代“诸侯经济”忧思录
    各项宏观控制措施每每半途而废，令行不止，并非皆出自决策者的失误。
    频频告急的“财贸大战”，诸如“黄麻大战”，“茶叶大战”，偏偏发源于行政区域交界地带。
    广东缺粮食，只得用大把外汇进口泰国大米，而安徽、江西等省大米积压库中，无处求佛。
    以上诸多“异常”现象，同我国业已形成的“诸侯经济”格局有关。
    中国经济体制改革首先从改革高度的中央集权体制入手，以增加地方经济决策的自主权和灵活性。然而，由上至下的行政性放权，在提高了地方政府积极性同时也引起了行政过多干预经济的变相集权式体制复归。在治理、整顿过程中物价控制指标的分配，各种专营制度、限价政策的实施，又进一步滋长了地区间的经济摩擦，“诸侯经济”俨然圈中之圈，使得改革以来倡导的开放、搞活方针受到困扰，推动着中国经济向松散型转变。
      “诸侯经济”的两个最显著特征是彼此间的贸易封锁和资源争夺。
    区域贸易封锁使得市场自身的运行规范屈从于行政规则，增加了企业间横向联合的风险。
    区域封锁增加了市场物价控制的难度。沿海发达地区对工业消费品封锁，内外二价或易地涨价，致使内地省份零售物价高涨；原材料省份在饱尝了工业消费品封锁之苦后，也不得不起用“良策”。一时间关卡林立，禁运通知纷纷扬扬，致使原材料、能源价格上扬，供求矛盾加剧。尽管沿海省份有充足财源与内地争夺资源，但无论如何也无法冲破行政干预形成的割据势力。由于沿海省份失去了对原材料价格的控制，也就无法稳定产品成本，由此出现物价轮番上涨。
    不仅如此，区域封锁使企业失去了灵活性，行政干预又使得企业过分依赖于政府，使得国家在下放管理权限中，仍像蜗牛一样负重爬行。
    “诸侯经济”是我国新旧体制交替进程中产生的“怪胎”，它和未来的统一的商品经济新格局是完全相悖的。
