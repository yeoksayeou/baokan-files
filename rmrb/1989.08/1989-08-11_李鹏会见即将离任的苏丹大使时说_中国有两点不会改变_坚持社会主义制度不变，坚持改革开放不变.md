Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 11th.

Premier Li Peng today met with the outgoing Sudanese Ambassador to China, Muhammad Matal, and reiterated: China is also a developing country, and the Chinese people sincerely wish to develop friendly and cooperative relations with the peoples of the world, including the peoples of Africa and the Arab world, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Li Peng said, "The Chinese people will never forget their friends who supported them in times of difficulty."

During the meeting, Li Peng expressed his gratitude to Matal for his positive contributions to the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Sudan, as well as between China and African and Arab countries, during his nine-year tenure in China.

Matal has served as the Sudanese Ambassador to China since October 1980. He is also the head of the diplomatic corps in China and the head of the diplomatic corps of African and Arab countries in China.

Li Peng fondly recalled his visit to Sudan in 1984. He said, "Time flies! In these five years, the world situation has undergone great changes; overall, it has developed in a direction that is beneficial to the peoples of the world and conducive to world peace."

Li Peng said that in these five years, China has also undergone great changes, and it has developed in a positive direction, benefiting the people.

He said, "Recently, we have successfully suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in Beijing. History will prove that the suppression of the riots is not only beneficial to China's current development but also to China's long-term development, and it is in the fundamental interests of the broad masses of Chinese workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other sectors of the people."

Li Peng hoped that Matal would share his observations and personal experiences in China with other African friends upon his return to his country and explain to them that regardless of the changes in China, two points will remain unchanged: first, the adherence to the socialist system; second, the adherence to reform and opening up.

Premier Li Peng said that these two points are not contradictory but complementary. Reform and opening up are aimed at improving the socialist system and providing more favorable conditions for socialist modernization. He said, "These two points represent the common aspirations of the Chinese people. Anyone who goes against this historical trend will ultimately fail."

Matal congratulated China on its progress in socialist construction. He said that the Sudanese people and the Chinese people are friends in times of adversity. The positive changes in China are beneficial to the Chinese people and the peoples of the world.

Matal expressed that he would continue to work for the development of friendship between Sudan and China, regardless of his future position.

Li Peng asked Matal to convey his greetings to the Sudanese leadership upon his return to his country.

    李鹏会见即将离任的苏丹大使时说
    中国有两点不会改变
    坚持社会主义制度不变，坚持改革开放不变
    新华社北京8月11日电  国务院总理李鹏今天会见即将离任的苏丹驻华大使穆罕默德·马塔尔时重申：中国也是发展中国家，中国人民真诚愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上，同包括非洲人民和阿拉伯人民在内的世界各国人民发展友好合作关系。
    李鹏说，中国人民永远不会忘记在困难的时候支持他们的朋友。
    会见时，李鹏对马塔尔在华长达9年的任期内，为发展中国和苏丹间的友好合作关系以及中国同非洲、阿拉伯国家之间的友好合作关系作出的积极贡献表示感谢。
    马塔尔从1980年10月起出任苏丹驻华大使。他还是外国驻华外交团团长以及非洲和阿拉伯国家驻中国外交团团长。
    李鹏愉快地回忆了1984年他对苏丹的访问。他说：“时间过得真快！在这5年中，世界形势发生了很大变化；总的看，是朝着有利于世界人民，有利于世界和平的方向发展。”
    李鹏说，在这5年中，中国也发生了很大变化，也是向着好的方向，向着有利于人民的方向发展。
    他说：“最近我们胜利地平息了发生在北京的反革命暴乱。历史将证明，暴乱的平息不仅有利于中国当前的发展，也有利于中国长远的发展，符合中国广大的工人、农民、知识分子和其他各界人民的根本利益。”
    李鹏希望马塔尔回国后将自己在华的所见所闻和亲身感受告诉其他非洲朋友，并向他们说明：中国无论发生什么变化，有两点是不会改变的——一是坚持社会主义制度不变；二是坚持改革开放不变。
    李鹏总理说，这两点不是对立的，而是相辅相成的。改革开放是为了完善社会主义制度和为社会主义现代化建设提供更加有利的条件。他说：“这两点代表了中国人民的共同愿望。无论是谁，如果他违背了这一历史潮流，最终都将以失败而告终。”
    马塔尔对中国在社会主义建设中取得的进步表示祝贺。他说，苏丹人民和中国人民是患难中的朋友。中国发生的积极变化对中国人民和世界人民都是有利的。
    马塔尔表示，今后无论在什么岗位上工作，他都将继续为发展苏丹和中国的友谊作出努力。
    李鹏请马塔尔回国后向苏丹领导人转达他的问候。
