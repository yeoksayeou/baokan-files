Edition: 6

The long-form biography *The Tragedy of the Commander-in-Chief – A Biography of Zhao Shangzhi* has been published by Huanghe Literature and Art Publishing House. Since the publication of the long-form biography *China's Summer Yang – A Biography of Zhao Shangzhi*, it has been warmly received and widely discussed by readers. Its sequel, *The Tragedy of the Commander-in-Chief*, has now been released to readers.

Zhao Shangzhi was a heroic figure who shook the world. In the midst of the stormy and bloody battles in the mountains and forests of Northeast China, he struck like a thunderbolt, appearing and disappearing without trace, and striking the Japanese invaders. He achieved victory after victory, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy. At that time, the Soviet Red Army praised him as "China's Summer Yang." Even the arrogant Japanese Kwantung Army had to admit that in the "small 'Manchukuo,'" they had encountered the formidable Zhao Shangzhi.

Zhao Shangzhi was not only a brilliant military strategist but also a tragic figure who faced numerous hardships. He was expelled from the Party twice, which left his anti-Japanese armed forces leaderless and suffered repeated setbacks, ultimately falling into the hands of the enemy. Zhao himself was captured and died heroically in battle. The injustices he suffered were not rectified until nearly half a century later, after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, when he was posthumously reinstated into the Party.

*The Tragedy of the Commander-in-Chief – A Biography of Zhao Shangzhi* mainly depicts the tragic history of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's journey from victory to defeat. The entire book is filled with sorrow and grandeur, provoking deep thought, and brimming with patriotic passion. The author, in portraying vivid characters, reveals the broad historical panorama of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's struggle.

The author, Wang Zhongyu, is a professional writer from Heilongjiang Province. He has written many long-form novels, including *Eagle Strikes the Sky*, *Thunderclap*, and *Li Zhaolin*.

    《总司令的悲剧——赵尚志传》〔长篇传记〕
    作者王忠瑜　黄河文艺出版社出版
    长篇传记小说《中国的夏伯阳——赵尚志传》出版以来，受到广大读者的欢迎和关注，其续集《总司令的悲剧》最近又与读者见面。
    赵尚志是一位叱咤风云的英雄，他在腥风血雨的白山黑水之间，似霹雳旋风，神出鬼没地打击日本侵略军。他出奇制胜，屡建奇功，使敌人闻风丧胆。当时的苏联红军称赞他是“中国的夏伯阳”。连不可一世的日本关东军也不得不承认，在“小小的‘满洲国’，遇上了大大的赵尚志”。
    赵尚志既是一位足智多谋的军事家，又是一位遭遇坎坷，屡经磨难的悲剧人物。他曾两次被开除党籍，致使他领导的抗日武装，群龙无首，几经挫折，最终葬送在日寇之手，而他自己也在一次战斗中被捕，壮烈牺牲。他自己所受的不白之冤，经历近半个世纪，到党的十一届三中全会之后才得以昭雪，重新恢复了党籍。
    《总司令的悲剧——赵尚志传续集》主要描写了北满抗日联军由胜利走向失败的悲剧史。全书悲怆豪壮，发人深思，充满爱国主义激情。作家在刻画生动的人物形象时，揭示了东北抗联斗争广阔的历史画面。
    作者王忠瑜是黑龙江省专业作家，写过如《鹰击长空》、《惊雷》、《李兆麟》等多篇长篇小说。
