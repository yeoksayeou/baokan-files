Nicaraguan anti-government forces have declared that they will return to the mountains of Nicaragua with their weapons to continue the armed struggle until the government achieves "complete democratization."

Currently, reporters from the Honduran newspaper *El Tiempo* had the opportunity to enter the camp of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces on the southern border and conducted on-site interviews. According to the newspaper, the Nicaraguan anti-government forces accused the presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador of "not forcing the Nicaraguan government to democratize first." Therefore, the anti-government forces are drafting a report to be submitted to the International Verification Commission, outlining several conditions under which they would agree to "demobilization." These conditions include government guarantees for their safe return home; complete democratization; general amnesty; separation of the state, parties, and the military; abolition of socialist cooperatives; and reduction of the military, among others.

The headquarters of the anti-government forces stationed in Honduras claims that they still have 21,000 military personnel ready for combat, rather than the "12,000" usually reported by the five presidents and the international media.

    尼反政府武装声称将坚持战争
    本报特古西加尔巴（洪都拉斯）8月11日电　记者郭伟成报道：尼加拉瓜反政府武装声称，他们将带着武器回到尼加拉瓜山区里去坚持武装战争，直到政府实现“完全的民主化”。
    目前，洪都拉斯《新闻报》记者有机会进入了南部边境尼加拉瓜反政府武装的营地，进行了实地采访。据这家报纸报道说，尼加拉瓜反政府武装指责哥斯达黎加、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多4国总统“没有迫使尼加拉瓜政府先实行民主化”，为此，反政府武装正在拟订一份将要递交国际核查委员会的报告，提出若干他们服从“遣散”的条件。其中包括政府提供他们回国的“充分保障”；实行完全的民主化；普遍大赦；国家、政党与军队分离；取消社会主义合作社；裁减军队等等。
    驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的反政府武装总参谋部声称：他们还拥有21000名可以投入战斗的军事人员，而不是“五国总统与国际新闻界通常说的12000人。
