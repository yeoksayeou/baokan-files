The Eight-Sided Tower of Chifeng

People's Daily reporter Huang Caizhong

This eight-sided tower is not located in the revolutionary base of Jinggangshan. It resembles a flat dumbbell, with two eight-sided buildings standing four stories high, facing the wind in all directions, and standing out with its unique design in the suburbs of Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia.

Its owner, Sun Xuezheng, the general manager of Chifeng Eight-Sided Tower Industrial Company, instructed the designers at the beginning of the construction: "Innovative and unique, a permanent advertisement, as a symbol of the village-run enterprises in the countryside." As expected, after a few years, "Gongnongcun" gradually faded from people's memory, but the "Eight-Sided Tower" became famous in Chifeng City and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. After investigating this village-run enterprise, Chairman Buhe of the Autonomous Region Region spontaneously wrote a poem: "Building the Eight-Sided Tower, earning millions annually, farmers running factories, everyone is capable."

I arrived in Chifeng and, like many passersby, was quickly attracted by the "unique" Eight-Sided Tower. Relevant parties provided me with some figures: this enterprise, known as the Eight-Sided Tower, earned 16.22 million yuan last year, with an average of over 1,100 yuan in taxes paid to the state per worker, and an average income of over 1,100 yuan per person. I understood: this is not a coastal area, but a region where culture and technology were previously relatively backward, and it is not easy to achieve such good results. "How did you manage to do so well?" The villagers almost unanimously replied: "Our village has a few good leaders, and they have a good set of management methods." Old farmer Sun Yugui told me: "Although we villagers earn more than those in neighboring villages, our cadres earn less than others." Of course, it is not that the cadres of the Eight-Sided Tower do not want to work hard, nor is it that their abilities are lower than others. Sun Xuezheng has long mastered the construction industry. When others invited him to take on business, promising a 10 million yuan deal with a 1 million yuan kickback, Sun Xuezheng shook his head and replied, "No point," and turned them away. Deputy General Manager Wang Lin is responsible for business operations. Every few days, clients would secretly offer him bribes, but this veteran village cadre and old Party member has no special affection for money. He said: "The development of the Eight-Sided Tower to this day has been difficult, and it is not worth it for just one person to get rich!" Villagers An Falin and Li Lijun took me to visit their newly built two-story villa and then took me to see Sun Xuezheng's 1972-built four-room flat. They intentionally wanted me to compare.

With the same question, I interviewed Sun Xuezheng. Old Sun did not hide his views: "In a place, for example, our suburban township, it is easy for one person to get rich, and it is not difficult for ten people to get rich. However, if a hundred or a thousand people want to get rich, it becomes difficult. We cadres should fulfill our duties and help more fellow villagers get rich; now we have enough to eat and drink, have a certain foundation, and are not like before when we could not get by. It is worth it for a Communist Party member to sacrifice some personal interests." This "old three-class" student, who came to Gongnongcun from Chengde, Hebei Province in 1968 to work in the countryside, has done everything from farming to beekeeping, raising pigs, building roads, and constructing houses. He and more than 700 young and middle-aged villagers spent more than a decade, using their sweat to nurture the tall "Eight-Sided Tower." Recruiting workers and moving to the city did not attract him, and he became a "People's Representative" who stayed in Gongnongcun.

On the morning of July 15, 1985, at 9:00 AM, something happened that shocked everyone in the Eight-Sided Tower: five key cadres under Sun Xuezheng suddenly proposed to leave the Eight-Sided Tower to make big money elsewhere. Fortunately, the pillars were not shaken, and the Eight-Sided Tower would not collapse so easily? Sun Xuezheng said: "The collective has a future and can withstand tests. I cannot leave the Eight-Sided Tower collective, especially those widows and orphans who only know how to work hard and do not understand technology. I am even more reluctant to abandon them!" Those who wanted to leave left the Eight-Sided Tower, and those who stayed worked even harder. Sun Xuezheng led the villagers to establish 12 factories under the Eight-Sided Tower, producing bricks, steel windows, construction, and more. Every time a new business was started, he was the first to pave the way, plan and design, master the technical essentials, and then pass on the entire set of skills to the villagers. That year, he went to Harbin to learn how to produce cables. The car broke down in Shenyang, and Old Sun's face was cut by glass, stitched with dozens of stitches, his eyes were covered, and his mouth could not open. After the operation, almost without rest, Old Sun rushed back to Harbin; it took more than half a month in total, and he returned to Chifeng only after obtaining the true skills. The cable factory is the one they established that saw the fastest results, investing 8 million yuan and recovering 3.5 million yuan in half a year. Now, the cables of the Eight-Sided Tower are popular all over the country, and the villagers say that Old Sun has invested the most effort.

The leaders in charge work the most but earn the least. In recent years, when the Eight-Sided Tower implemented the principle of distribution according to work, the villagers gradually formed a consensus: focusing only on the present is not good, and focusing only on personal gain is also not good. They pay taxes to the state in Chifeng as an advanced unit, like paying public grain in the past, not a penny less, not a day late. After the collective has money, a considerable part of it is used for accumulation and expansion of production, maintaining an average annual income growth of 5%. Everyone deeply feels the importance of science and technology, and is willing to invest in intelligence, spending 2 million yuan just to establish their own primary school. The cable factory bought 150 tons of aluminum at the beginning of last year, at 6,300 yuan per ton, and later the market price rose to 12,000 yuan. The "price difference" made them unexpectedly "profit" by fifty or sixty million yuan, with an average of seven or eight thousand yuan per person. The company's leaders discussed: is this considered potential or operational profit? Neither, so this money cannot be distributed. Last year, the average wage for a worker in the cable factory was 5 yuan and 2 jiao, only 2 jiao more than the previous year. In contrast, the brick and tile factory workers had a much higher workload, and last year, due to the poor quality of the clay, the price of the tiles was affected, and the average wage for a worker was only 1 yuan per day. Later, after a discussion by the company's leaders, it was decided to still supplement it to 5 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao and 5 fen over the previous year.

These things spread outside, and many people found them "strange," but the villagers proudly told me: "This is also the unique feature of the Eight-Sided Tower."

    赤峰的八角楼
    本报记者　黄彩忠
    这座八角楼不在革命根据地井冈山。它像一只平放的哑铃，两幢四层高楼八面临风，以其独特的样式屹立于内蒙古赤峰市郊。
    它的主人——赤峰八角楼实业公司总经理孙学政，在建楼伊始就向设计人员交待了他的设想：“新颖而奇特，永久性广告，作为工农村村办企业的象征”。果不出所料，刚过几个年头，“工农村”在人们记忆中逐渐淡忘了，“八角楼”却在赤峰市、在内蒙古自治区叫响了。自治区政府布赫主席调查这个村办企业后，即兴赋诗：“自建八角楼，年利百万金，农家办工厂，行行有能人。”
    我来到赤峰，和许多过往行人一样，很快就被“独此一家”的八角楼吸引住了。有关方面向我提供了一些数字：这个名为八角楼的企业去年收入1622万元，平均每个职工向国家纳税1100多元，人均收入也是1100多元。我心里明白：这里不是沿海，而是文化、技术原先都较落后的少数民族地区，能有这么好的成绩实在不容易。“你们怎么干得这么出色？”村民几乎异口同声地回答：我们村里有几个好带头人，他们有一套经营管理的好办法。老农孙玉贵告诉我：“别看我们当老百姓的比邻村的都挣得多，可是我们的干部却比人家收入少。”当然不是八角楼的干部舍不得干，也不是他们能力比别人低。孙学政早把建筑这一行摸透了，人家请他去揽生意，答应100万元的买卖回扣10万元。孙学政脑袋一摇，回答一句“没意思”，就把人家拒之门外了。副经理王林具体分工管业务，三天两头遇上客户悄悄送好处费，这个当了几十年村干部的老党员对金钱没有特殊的感情。他说：“八角楼发展到今天不容易，让我一个人发了，犯不上！”村民安法利、李丽君领我去参观他们新建的两层小洋楼后，又领我去看孙学政家1972年盖的4间小平房。他们有意让我比一比。
    带着同样的问题采访孙学政。老孙毫不隐瞒自己的观点：“在一个地方，例如我们城郊乡，一个人发财容易，十个人发财也不难，一百个，一千个人想发财就困难了。我们当干部的应尽点义务，帮助更多乡亲富起来；眼下我们吃喝不愁，有一定的基础，又不像以前那样过不下去，共产党员牺牲点个人利益值得。”这位“老三届”、1968年从河北承德来工农村插队的知青，种菜、养蜂、喂猪、修路、建房……样样干过，他和700多名青壮村民花了十几年功夫，用汗水浇灌出了高大的“八角楼”。招工、进城，都吸引不了他，他成了长住工农村的“人民代表”。
    1985年7月15日上午9点钟，发生了一件轰动八角楼上上下下的事：孙学政手下5名得力的干将突然提出离开八角楼，外出挣大钱。好在摇晃的不是顶梁柱，八角楼哪能这样就散了摊？孙学政说：“集体有前途，经得起考验，我离不开八角楼这个集体，尤其是那些孤儿寡母、只会卖力气不懂技术的穷哥们，我更舍不得抛开他们！”想走的离开了八角楼，留下的干得更起劲。孙学政领着乡亲们办了八角楼所辖12家工厂，烧砖瓦、造钢窗、搞建筑……开创每一项事业无不是他首先去开路，规划设计好了，掌握了技术要领，再手把手地将全套本事交给乡亲。那年到哈尔滨学习生产电缆，汽车跑到沈阳出了车祸，老孙的脸被玻璃划破，缝了几十针，眼睛蒙住了，嘴都张不开。做完手术，几乎没休息，老孙就马不停蹄地往哈尔滨赶；前前后后花了半个多月时间，取到了真经才回赤峰。电缆厂是他们办的见效最快的一个厂，投资80万元，半年就收回了35万元。如今八角楼的电缆畅销大江南北，村民们都说老孙花的心血最多。
    当家主事的干得多，拿的少。八角楼这几年落实按劳分配原则时，村民们也就逐渐形成了这样一个共识：光顾眼前多得不行，光顾个人多得也不行。他们向国家纳税在赤峰是先进单位，像过去交公粮一样，一分不少，一天不迟。集体有了钱，相当多的一部分用于积累扩大再生产，人均收入保持每年增长5％的水平。大家深感科学技术的重要，智力投资舍得花钱，光自办小学就投了20万元。电缆厂去年初买了150吨铝，每吨6300元，后来市价涨到12000元，“价格差”使他们意外“盈利”五六十万元，人均七八千元。公司的头头们讨论说：这算挖潜来的呢，还是经营来的？都不是，所以这个钱不能分。去年，电缆厂平均一个工5元2角，只比上年增加2角钱。相反，砖瓦厂工人劳动强度大得多，去年因陶土质量差，影响了瓦价，平均每个职工干一天只能分得一元钱。后来，经公司头头们讨论，决定还是补到5元，比上年增加1角5分钱。
    这些事传到外边，不少人都觉得“怪”，村民们却自豪地告诉我：这也是八角楼的独特之处。
