		Urgent telegrams, like snowflakes, are flying in. The head of the Textile Industry Department recently warned: Due to the imbalance in cotton supply and demand, costs are skyrocketing, and a large-scale shutdown is threatening China's cotton textile industry.

		Cotton is an important pillar of the national economy. Cotton accounts for 70% of the raw materials in the textile industry. Cotton textiles are the leading export commodity. In the aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, cotton supports an entire army. Nearly 500 million yuan of cotton textiles are provided to the state's fiscal revenue.

		However, the cotton textile industry, known as the "money tree," is facing the risk of shutting down. The raw material allocation plan cannot be fulfilled, adulteration and false labeling are becoming more serious, causing a decline in national yarn and fabric production in the first half of the year, and enterprises are barely profitable or even making losses. The "money tree" has become a "bitter flower."

		"Save the National Team"

		Not long ago, the managers and directors of the top ten textile enterprises in the country jointly issued an urgent appeal: Save the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. The "national team" of the textile industry cannot collapse.

		This year, to complete the cotton spinning production plan assigned by the state, there is a significant gap in cotton supply. In the first seven months of the cotton year, the three major textile bases in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai received only about 55% of the cotton that should have been supplied. While the 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Shenyang, Harbin, and Chongqing, actually received less than 40% of the planned cotton supply. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises cannot obtain cotton, and they are crying out in pain. However, the small cotton spinning mills operated by the supply and marketing cooperatives involved in cotton procurement are blooming everywhere, with ample raw material supply. According to incomplete statistics, the small yarn mills and small cotton spinning mills operated by the supply and marketing cooperatives in Hebei and Shandong alone consume more than 500,000 dan of cotton each year.

		Not Benefiting Farmers

		The state divides textile cotton into five grades, but raising the grade and price has become a "trick" for making huge profits in the cotton distribution process.

		For many years, under normal weather conditions, first-grade cotton in Hebei Province has accounted for only about 2% of the total cotton production. However, this year, the operating departments in the province supplied 80% of the so-called first-grade cotton to the textile industry. The fiber inspection institution in Beijing re-examined four batches of "first-grade cotton" purchased by the Beijing Cotton Mill from cotton-producing areas, and the results showed that one batch was second-grade, one batch was fourth-grade, and two batches were fifth-grade. The Textile Industry Department summarized the situation of large and medium-sized enterprises nationwide, and found that the cotton sold by cotton operating units in various places was, on average, two grades higher than the actual grade. This alone can earn a profit of 1.5 billion yuan.

		Is the profit from raising the grade and price used to support cotton farmers? The fiber inspection station in Henan Province checked 32 cotton procurement stations in 14 counties and found that the procurement grade matched the national standard at a rate of over 95%, indicating that there was basically no grade-raising phenomenon when purchasing cotton from farmers. However, at the same time, the cotton purchased by cotton mills in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and other places from the designated state-operated departments was found to be generally two grades higher than the actual grade, with a matching rate of less than 10%. This shows that the profit from raising the grade and price is mostly retained in the middle link, while farmers get almost nothing.

		In addition to raising the grade and price, many operating departments in various places have, in addition to the state-regulated cotton supply price, cunningly created various fees such as labor fees, organizational fees, storage fees, freight fees, and loss fees, totaling more than ten items. Enterprises complain that these fees do not enter the national treasury and do not enrich farmers, but often amount to a 50% increase in raw material costs.

		Adulteration and Fraud Harming the State

		Adulteration in cotton has developed from adding water, cotton lint, yellow cotton, and other materials to adding bricks, cement blocks, sand, and mud bricks. The Benxi Second Cotton Mill found 30,000 kilograms of bricks and other impurities in the 680,000 kilograms of cotton it purchased. Even more astonishing, the fiber inspection station in Handan City, Hebei Province, inspected 500 dan of cotton from a cotton gin in Yongnian County and found that the cotton contained a large amount of talcum powder. Cotton mixed with talcum powder looks particularly white, but the cohesion of the cotton fibers is greatly reduced, making it impossible to spin into yarn.

		Due to the severe adulteration of cotton, accidents of machine damage in textile mills have increased, and many enterprises have to operate at reduced speeds. Some famous and high-quality products and export products have difficulty in matching cotton, and the quality has generally declined. The adulteration of raw materials is threatening the international market and reputation that China's textile industry has struggled to gain over decades.

		It's Time to Crack Down on Illegal Activities

		Cotton is a state-monopolized commodity. In theory, textile enterprises and raw material operating departments can resolve disputes over cotton grades, quality, and prices through relevant institutions for inspection, evaluation, and arbitration. However, most enterprises prefer to suffer in silence rather than seek justice. For enterprises, winning a "lawsuit" is not difficult, but the "small shoes" given by the operating departments will never end. A textile mill in a certain region of Guangdong won a lawsuit against a cotton supply unit in a cotton-producing area and even received compensation, but afterwards, the supply unit cut off the cotton supply to all textile mills in that region.

		In addition, the current trend of demanding money and goods from enterprises in cotton operations is becoming more and more rampant. Some demand plain-price cloth, cars, refrigerators, and color TVs, while others demand pesticides, fertilizers, coal, and white sugar. These items are either sold by the unit or go into personal pockets, seriously undermining the party's style of work and social ethics.

		The cadres and workers of the textile industry, after reporting the above problems to the reporters, called on the relevant departments to crack down on the pests that disrupt the cotton distribution order and thoroughly investigate their illegal and disciplinary activities. They should take effective administrative and economic measures to ensure that the state's cotton allocation plan is completed on time, in quantity, and in quality, especially to ensure the cotton supply for the production of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and to ensure the stable growth of state fiscal revenue. The benefits of cotton price increases should be directly given to cotton farmers to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for cotton production. Before the new cotton is on the market, the state should arrange to transport part of the cotton reserve to alleviate the urgent need of many enterprises facing shutdown.

    整顿棉花流通秩序
    保护“国家队”正常生产
    新华社记者　李安定　本报记者　莫新元
    告急的电报，雪片似地飞来。纺织部负责人日前警告说：由于棉花供需失衡，成本激增，大面积停产的严峻局面正威胁着我国棉纺工业。
    棉花，是国民经济的重要支柱。棉花，占纺织工业原料的70％。棉纺织品，居出口商品之首。衣食住行中，棉花支撑着一个方面军。国家的财政收入里，棉纺织品提供了近50亿元。
    然而号称“摇钱树”的棉纺工业正面临断炊之虞。原料分配计划无法兑现，掺杂使假、等级虚高日益严重，造成上半年全国纱、布产量滑坡，企业微利以至亏损，“摇钱树”成了“苦菜花”。
    “救救国家队”
    不久前，全国十大纺织企业的经理、厂长联名发出紧急呼吁：救救国营大中型企业，纺织行业的“国家队”不能垮。
    今年，要完成国家下达的棉纺生产计划，棉花供应的缺口很大。京、津、沪三大纺织基地在本棉花年度的头7个月里，仅得到应该供应棉花的55％左右；而黑龙江、吉林、浙江、福建、湖南、广东、四川及沈阳、哈尔滨、重庆等17个省、自治区和计划单列市棉花实际进货不到计划的40％。国营大中型企业拿不到棉花，叫苦不迭，而从事棉花收购工作的供销社系统自办的小棉纺厂却遍地开花，原料供应十分充足。据不完全统计，光是河北、山东供销社系统自办的小纱厂、小棉纺厂每年吃掉的棉花就高达50多万担。
    并非农民得到实惠
    国家规定纺织用棉共分五个等级，而采取抬级加价成了棉花流通过程中牟取暴利的一个“高招”。
    多少年来，按正常年景，河北省一等棉花只占棉花总产量的2％左右，而今年该省经营部门供应纺织工业的棉花中，所谓一级棉竟占了80％。北京纤维检验机构复查了京棉一厂从产棉区购进的四批“一级棉”，结果一批为二级、一批为四级、两批为五级。纺织工业部汇总全国大中型企业情况，各地棉花经营单位售出的棉花，平均虚高两个等级，仅此一项，即可获利15亿元。
    是不是经营部门在收购棉花时，把抬级抬价的好处用于扶持棉农呢？河南省纤检所对全省14个县32个棉花收购站进行检查，收购品级与国家标样相符率在95％以上，说明收购农民棉花时基本没有抬级现象。但与此同时，对郑州、开封等地棉纺厂从国家指定的专营部门购进的棉花进行检查，都发现普遍虚高两个品级，相符率竟不到10％。由此可见：抬级抬价的好处大部分留在中间环节，而棉农却所得无几。
    除了抬级抬价，不少地区的经营部门在国家规定的棉花供应价格之外，还巧立名目，强行收取劳务费、组织费、保管费、运杂费、亏损费等十多项费用。企业抱怨说，这些费用进不了国库，富不了农民，加起来往往相当原料成本上涨50％。
    掺杂使假坑害国家
    在棉花中掺假，从掺水、掺棉短绒、掺黄棉等发展到掺砖头、水泥块、砂子、土坯等各种硬杂物。本溪第二棉纺厂在购进的6.8万公斤棉花中竟捡出1.2万块砖头等3万公斤杂物。更有甚者，河北省邯郸市纤维检验所抽查永年县某轧花厂的500担棉花，发现棉花中竟大量掺有滑石粉。掺了滑石粉的棉花看上去格外洁白，但棉纤维抱合力大大下降，根本无法纺成棉纱。
    由于棉花掺杂严重，纺织厂机器损坏事故增多，许多企业只得降速运行，一些名优产品和出口产品配棉发生困难，质量普遍下降。原料掺杂已威胁到我国纺织工业努力拚搏数十年获得的国际市场和信誉。
    该治一治不法行为
    棉花是国家实行专营的物资，按说，纺织企业和原料经营部门在棉花等级、品质、价格等方面发生纷争，完全可以通过相应的机构进行检验、评判和仲裁，然而，大部分企业宁愿自认倒霉，而不愿去寻求公道。对于企业来说，打赢一场“官司”并不难，但以后经营部门给的“小鞋”就穿不完。广东某地区一个纺织厂和产棉区某供棉单位就棉花等级争执打赢了官司，还得到赔款，但事后供应单位卡断了这一地区所有纺织厂的棉花供应。
    此外，目前在棉花经营中向企业索要钱物之风越来越盛。有索要平价纱布、小轿车、电冰箱、彩电的，也有索要农药、化肥、煤炭、白糖的，这些物品或用于单位倒卖，或进个人腰包，严重败坏了党风和社会风气。
    纺织行业的干部和职工们在向记者反映了上述问题后，呼吁有关部门要治治扰乱棉花流通秩序的蛀虫，彻底清查他们的违法乱纪活动。要采取有力的行政、经济手段，保证国家棉花调拨计划按质按量按时完成，尤其应重点保证国营大中型企业生产用棉，确保国家财政收入稳定增长。要把棉花提价的好处直接给予棉农，鼓励农民种棉积极性。在新棉上市之前，由国家安排调运部分棉花储备，以缓解众多企业面临停产的燃眉之急。
