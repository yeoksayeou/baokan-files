	For Comrade Ma Siqi's Root Artwork
	Chang Renxia

	Drink from the wells of the Great Wall
	Let loose your hair by the Yi River
	Stand tall to open the earth
	Cross the Yellow River through wind and rain

	Note: The root artwork "Horse in the North of Hebei" is a work by Ma Siqi, the president of the Root Art Research Society of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Association. Following 1987, it was again selected this year as the award emblem for the "Liu Kaituo Root Art Award."
