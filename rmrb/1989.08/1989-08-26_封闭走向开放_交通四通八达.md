Shanxi, an inland province where hilly and mountainous terrain accounts for 80% of its total area, has seen modern transportation break through natural barriers and isolation. The narrow-gauge railways and dead-end roads of the past have been replaced by a comprehensive network of railways, highways, air routes, and waterways. In 1949, the province had only 532 kilometers of railway. By 1988, the total length of railways in the province reached 3,315.3 kilometers, with 2,364.7 kilometers in operation. The double-track railway lines extended to 1,159 kilometers, and electrified railways developed from none to 912 kilometers. Additionally, five local railways totaling 468 kilometers were constructed. Shanxi's civil aviation has opened 10 routes, connecting directly to cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenyang. The Yellow River waterway has also been developed. Particularly noteworthy is the rapid development of highway transportation. In 1988, the total length of highways in the province reached 29,875 kilometers, an increase of 22 times compared to 1949. The length of paved highways reached 21,456 kilometers, accounting for 71.8% of the total, which is 136 times that of 1949.

The province has achieved the goal of having paved roads in every county, with 96.9% of townships and 94.2% of administrative villages connected by roads. The province now has over 180,000 civilian vehicles, which is 860 times the number in 1949. The volume of highway freight and passenger transport is 3,070 times and 1,255 times that of 1949, respectively. On average, 10 fully loaded coal trucks leave Shanxi every minute.

    封闭走向开放  交通四通八达
    丘陵山地占总面积80％的内陆省份山西，现代交通冲破了自然的封闭隔绝。昔日的窄铁轨、断头路，已被四通八达的铁路、公路、航空、水运交通网所代替。1949年，全省仅有532公里铁路，到1988年，全省铁路正线里程达3315.3公里，营业里程达到2364.7公里，铁路复线里程达1159公里，电气化铁路从无到有发展到912公里，还兴建了五条总长468公里的地方铁路。山西民航已开辟10条航线，可直达北京、上海、广州、成都、沈阳等城市。黄河航运也已开发。特别是公路交通有了迅猛发展。1988年，全省公路通车里程达到29875公里，比1949年增长22倍，油路面公路达到21456公里，占总里程的71.8％，为1949年的136倍。
    全省已实现县县通油路，有96.9％的乡镇通了公路，94.2％的行政村通了汽车。全省民用汽车已达18万辆以上，是1949年全省汽车的860倍，公路货运量和客运量分别是1949年的3070倍和1255倍。平均每分钟就有10辆满载煤炭的汽车开出山西。
