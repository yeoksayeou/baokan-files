Hou Dejian, a composer who hid in a foreign embassy after the counter-revolutionary riot, returned to his residence in Beijing's Shuangyushu yesterday. He was one of the last people to leave Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4.

This afternoon, Hou Dejian was interviewed at his home. He wore a dark gray T-shirt and black-rimmed glasses.

The reporter asked: "Some overseas newspapers reported that you were injured. Is that true?" Hou Dejian said: "I'm fine, I wasn't injured." He then recounted to the reporter his experience of leaving the square on June 4 and what he saw.

Hou Dejian said that on the night of June 3, the situation in the square was chaotic, and students were divided on whether to leave. After midnight, students gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes. Hou Dejian and three others who participated in the "72-hour" hunger strike were among them.

Hou Dejian said that at the time, including himself and the other 30-something participants, many people were not calm. At this point, two doctors from the Red Cross suggested they negotiate with the martial law troops. Around 3 AM on June 4, Hou Dejian and another hunger striker, accompanied by two Red Cross doctors, boarded an ambulance to meet with the martial law troops.

Hou Dejian said that they were stopped by the martial law troops on Chang'an Street in front of Tiananmen Square. A political commissar from the martial law troops came to meet with them and told them that the southeast corner of the square was left open for students to leave.

Hou Dejian then returned to the Monument to the People's Heroes to persuade the students to leave. At that time, students were deciding whether to leave or not by the loudness of their shouts. Hou Dejian said that at the time, he couldn't hear clearly which side was louder, but he didn't care. He saw students and pulled them away, persuading them to leave. By then, many students had already started to leave towards the southeast of the square.

He said that at the time, both the students and the soldiers were tense, and neither side knew what the other was going to do. Some soldiers held their guns horizontally, but when Hou Dejian gestured for them to point their guns upwards, most of the soldiers did so.

Hou Dejian said that during the entire evacuation process, he did not see any students, civilians, or soldiers being killed. He also did not see any tanks or armored vehicles pressing into the crowd. He saw three or four tanks parked outside the square. He said that he heard gunshots in the square and saw tear gas being released in the southwest corner. However, he said that the guns were fired into the air, and some were fired at the loudspeakers on the Monument to the People's Heroes.

Hou Dejian said that he was the last to leave the square, lying on a stretcher with some others. He said: "At the time, I was wrapped in a coat, and when I heard the gunshots, I was very scared, but the doctor told me not to be afraid, that the guns were fired into the air."

When the reporter asked about the situation of those "student leaders" at the time, Hou Dejian said that Wu'erkaixi announced on the radio that he was not feeling well, possibly due to a heart attack. Around 1-2 AM, he was carried to the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes by medical staff in the square. After Hou Dejian negotiated with the troops and returned, Wu'erkaixi was gone. Chai Ling and others were also in the square at the time, but when Hou Dejian went to find Chai Ling to negotiate with the martial law troops together, Chai Ling said: "I am the overall commander of the square and should stay in the square." Later, it was heard that Chai Ling left with the first batch of people to leave the square. Hou Dejian said that he did not know Wang Dan, but he heard that Wang Dan had come to the hunger strike tent once on the night of June 3, but he did not see him.

Hou Dejian said that he had detailed his observations during that period in the form of a diary. The original manuscript of this material is still in that foreign embassy in China and is planned to be published overseas soon. At the same time, he also agreed to publish it domestically. Hou Dejian said: "After writing this material, many friends at the time were very surprised, saying that this material is very different from what they heard, but I wrote what I actually saw."

After hiding in a foreign embassy on June 4, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had repeatedly made representations, stressing that it is illegal for foreign embassies in China to harbor Chinese citizens and that he should be allowed to leave as soon as possible.

Hou Dejian told the reporter today that during this period, he had contacted relevant departments and gradually understood the situation outside, deciding to leave the foreign embassy. Yesterday afternoon, he returned to his residence.

    侯德健谈“六·四”凌晨广场见闻
    撤离过程中无一人被打死也没见坦克压人
    新华社北京8月17日电　（记者长征、李志高）反革命暴乱发生后躲进某一个国家驻华机构的作曲家侯德健已于昨日返回他在北京双榆树的寓所。他是6月4日凌晨最后一批撤离天安门广场的人之一。
    今天下午，侯德健在家中接受了记者的采访。他身穿深灰色的T恤衫，戴黑色丝边眼镜。
    记者问：“当时一些海外报纸说你被打伤了，是真的吗？”侯德健说：“我很好，没有受伤。”随后，他向记者谈起了他6月4日撤离广场的经过和他看到的情形。
    侯德健说，6月3日那天夜里，广场上情况很混乱，学生们对是否撤离广场意见不一。零时以后，学生们聚集到纪念碑周围。侯德健和另外三名参加“72小时”绝食的人也在内。
    侯德健说，当时包括他们几个30多岁的人在内，很多人都不冷静。这时，红十字会的两名医生建议他们去和戒严部队交涉。6月4日凌晨三时许，侯德健和另外一名参加绝食的人在两名红十字会医生的陪同下，搭乘一辆救护车去戒严部队。
    侯德健说，他们在天安门广场前的长安街上被戒严部队拦住。戒严部队一位政委前来和他们会面，告诉他们广场的东南角留有让学生撤离的通道。
    随后，侯德健返回到纪念碑劝说学生撤离，当时学生们正用喊声的大小来决定撤还是不撤。侯德健说，当时他也听不清楚哪种声音更大，但他管不了那么多，见到学生就拉起他们，劝说他们撤离。这时，已有许多学生开始向广场的东南方向撤离了。
    他说，当时学生和部队战士的情绪都很紧张，双方都不知道对方要干什么。有些战士平端着枪，但当侯德健打手势要求他们把枪口朝上时，大部分战士这样做了。
    侯德健说，在整个撤离过程中，他没有看到一个学生、市民或解放军战士被打死，也没有见到坦克或装甲车压向人群。他见到有三四辆坦克停在广场外边。他说，他在广场上听到了枪声，并且看到在广场西南角施放了催泪弹。但是他说，枪是朝天开的，有的是朝纪念碑上的喇叭放的。
    侯德健说，他是躺在担架上和一些人一起最后撤离广场的。他说：“当时我被蒙在大衣里，听到枪声后很害怕，但医生告诉我不要怕，枪是朝天放的。”
    当记者问到当时那几个“学生领袖”的情况时，侯德健说，吾尔开希在广播时说他身体不舒服，可能是因为心脏病发作，大约一两点钟他被广场上的医护人员抬到纪念碑座上，当侯德健和部队交涉后回来就不见吾尔开希了。柴玲等人当时也在广场上，但当侯德健去找柴玲要她一起与戒严部队谈判时，柴玲说：“我是广场总指挥，应留在广场。”后来听说，柴玲随第一批撤离广场的人走了。侯德健说，他不认识王丹，只听说王丹6月3日晚上曾来过绝食棚一次，但他没有见到。
    侯德健说，他曾以日记的形式详细记述了那一段时间他的所见所闻，这份材料的原稿现仍留在那家外国驻华机构里，并准备最近在海外发表。同时，他也同意在国内发表。侯德健说：“我的这份材料写出来后，当时很多朋友都很吃惊，说这份材料与他们听到的情况差别很大，但我写的确实是我看到的实际情况。”
    侯德健于6月4日躲进某一个国家的驻华机构后，中国外交部曾多次提出交涉，强调指出：外国驻华机构收留中国公民是不合法的，应及早让他出来。
    侯德健今天对记者说，他在这期间和有关部门取得了联系，逐渐了解了外界情况，决定离开这家外国驻华机构。昨天下午他返回了自己的寓所。
