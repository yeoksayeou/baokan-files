Wang Chaowen, the Governor of Guizhou Province, recently emphasized at the provincial economic work conference that developing the economy must be based on stabilizing reform and opening-up policies. All policies and measures for reform and opening-up, which were formulated by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, and have been proven effective in promoting the development of productive forces through practice, must continue to be implemented without arbitrary changes. Even if individual policies need to be adjusted and improved, they must be carried out in an organized and step-by-step manner according to the deployment of the Central Committee and the requirements of the province. Local authorities must not act on their own and are strictly forbidden to arbitrarily change current policies.

Wang Chaowen said that specifically, the following policies must be stabilized:

1. Continue to implement the "Enterprise Law" and the factory director responsibility system without wavering.
2. Continue to promote various forms of contract responsibility systems. Except for individual enterprises that need necessary adjustments due to significant changes in external conditions, generally, no changes should be made.
3. Continue to implement the policy of linking enterprise wages with performance, stabilize policies in this area, and continuously summarize and improve them.
4. Continue to promote horizontal economic cooperation and develop enterprise groups in a planned and step-by-step manner.
5. Continue to adhere to the combination of planned economy and market regulation, and absolutely not revert to the old path of rigid economic control.
6. Continue to promote the development of various economic components under the premise of a predominantly public ownership system.
7. Continue to develop township enterprises. Adopt the policy of adjusting the structure, leveraging advantages, and vigorously developing them, and protect the enthusiasm of farmers and grassroots cadres in developing township enterprises.
8. Strengthen economic and technological cooperation and exchanges with the outside world, actively attract foreign investment, and more boldly implement the policy of opening up to the outside world.
9. Continue to focus on the work of the reform experiment zones and further explore experiences in deepening reforms.
10. Consistently implement the Party's policy on intellectuals and fully utilize the role of intellectuals in socialist construction.

Wang Chaowen emphasized that an important aspect of stabilizing reform and opening-up policies is to ensure that the thoughts of a broad range of cadres, especially those at the county level and above, are aligned with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the recent important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This is the ideological guarantee for stabilizing reform and opening-up policies.

    王朝文说，具体来讲，主要稳定以下政策：1、继续贯彻《企业法》，实行厂长负责制不能动摇；2、继续推行各种形式的承包责任制，除个别企业确因外部条件发生重大变化需要作必要调整外，一般不作变动；3、继续实行企业工资与效益挂钩办法，稳定这方面政策，并不断总结完善；4、继续开展横向经济联合，有领导、有步骤地发展企业集团；5、继续坚持计划经济与市场调节相结合，绝不能重新回到老路上去，把经济搞得死死的；6、继续坚持在以公有制为主体的前提下，促进多种经济成份的发展；7、继续坚持发展乡镇企业。要采取调整结构、发挥优势、大力发展的方针，保护农民和基层干部发展乡镇企业的积极性；8、加强对外经济技术合作与交流，积极引进外资，更大胆地实行对外开放政策；9、继续抓好改革试验区的工作，进一步探索深化改革的经验；10、一如既往地贯彻执行党的知识分子政策，充分发挥知识分子在社会主义建设中的作用。
    王朝文强调指出，稳定改革开放政策的一个十分重要的方面，就是要切实把广大干部特别是县以上干部的思想统一到十三届四中全会和邓小平同志最近的重要讲话精神上来，这是稳定改革开放政策的思想保证。
