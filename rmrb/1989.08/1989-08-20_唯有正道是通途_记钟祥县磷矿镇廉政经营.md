Only the Right Path Leads to Success
—A Record of Dingxiang County Phosphate Mine Town's Clean Governance

“Smoke and alcohol open the way, gifts and banquets come first,” in some township enterprises, this seems to have become a norm. However, Hubei Province Dingxiang County Phosphate Mine Town, this new industrial town, with its own business practices, has broken through the mundane cycle, becoming a new star among the township enterprises on the Jianghan Plain.

In 1988, the town's industrial output value was 19.25 million yuan, an increase of 37.2% over the previous year, accounting for 65.3% of the town's total industrial and agricultural output value, and the profits and taxes increased by 58.6% over the previous year. In the first half of this year, the town's industrial output value and profits and taxes increased by 34.9% and 20.8% respectively compared to the same period last year.

When discussing business practices, the town's deputy mayor in charge of industrial production, Zeng Xianliang, and deputy mayor Tian Jiabao, in one breath, shared their experiences of "three rely on, three do not rely on": relying on reform rather than connections, relying on quality rather than gifts, and relying on credibility rather than feasting.

Anlingdu Water Cement Factory once had good performance and was an advanced enterprise in Jingzhou Region. As the saying goes, "the bigger the tree, the more wind it attracts." Many "connections" demanded that the factory arrange jobs for their relatives and friends. In order to smooth things over, the factory arranged many "connections" in the office, with non-production personnel reaching dozens. As a result, the enterprise not only did not "activate," but also hurt the enthusiasm of the employees. Some technical and production backbone personnel left the factory, and the enterprise incurred a loss of over 500,000 yuan. After investigation, it was found that other enterprises in the town also faced varying degrees of threats from these "connections." The town party committee realized that relying solely on the leadership of the enterprise to resist these "connections" reaching out to the enterprise was not enough. They must deepen the enterprise reform, let the employees become the masters of the enterprise, and jointly resist the "nepotism." At the beginning of last year, 17 town-owned enterprises all implemented full staff risk mortgage contracting, reduced a large number of non-production personnel, enhanced the sense of responsibility of the employees, and when "connections" reached out to the enterprise again, the employees all had the right to question and resist. Some "connections" saw this situation and had to "keep silent." Last year, three enterprises in the town turned losses into profits, and 17 town-owned enterprises all achieved good economic benefits.

Some people say that the economic benefits of an enterprise are achieved by spending money to "send" and "eat." The positive and negative experiences of the Second Cement Factory drew the opposite conclusion: only by relying on quality and credibility can an enterprise survive. The former factory director, due to a deviated management idea, neglected the use of technical personnel and relaxed the management of product quality. By relying on feasting and gifts, he achieved "good" benefits, but the good times did not last long. Eventually, due to poor product quality, a user's dangerous house collapsed, causing huge economic and credibility losses to the factory. The new factory director, Liu Min, upon taking office, broke away from the "vicious circle" of feasting and gifts, invited back a batch of technical talents who had left, and focused on improving product quality, making the product qualification rate reach 94%. In October last year, a construction company from another province purchased a batch of cement with unexpired stability from the factory. Factory director Liu Min discovered this and that night, along with the supply and marketing department director, rushed to the company, persuading them not to use this batch of cement, and took compensation measures. The construction company was very moved and soon signed a long-term supply contract for 3,000 tons of cement with the cement factory.

Liu Min is like this, winning with quality, surviving with credibility, and bringing this enterprise that was on the verge of bankruptcy back to life. In the first half of this year, the factory did not treat a single guest, did not send a single gift, and the sales increased by 119% compared to the same period last year.

According to the town, more than ten town-owned enterprises have been praised by higher authorities as "contract-abiding and creditworthy enterprises."

At the beginning of this year, the town's industrial office held an annual phosphate ore supply meeting. The meeting, originally planned for 3 days, was shortened to 1 day. There were 68 company representatives from 12 provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as municipal and county leaders. During the meal, there were six dishes and one soup, no high-grade cigarettes and souvenirs were prepared, and the accommodation fees were self-paid. This supply meeting only spent 4,600 yuan, saving 150,000 yuan compared to last year's order meeting. In addition to signing a 300,000-ton phosphate ore supply contract, the supply meeting also secured 1 million yuan in advance payment, 80 tons of gasoline, 1,460 tons of diesel, and 3,000 tons of fertilizer and other urgently needed industrial and agricultural materials.

    唯有正道是通途
    ——记钟祥县磷矿镇廉政经营
    张道国　杨兴国
    “烟酒开路，吃送先行”，在一些乡镇企业似乎成了惯例。然而，湖北省钟祥县磷矿镇这个新型的工业集镇以自己的经营之道，冲破了世俗的怪圈，成为江汉平原上乡镇企业的一颗新星。
    1988年，全镇工业产值1925万元，比上年上升37.2％，占镇工农业总产值的65.3％，利税比上年上升58.6％。今年上半年，全镇工业产值、利税分别比去年同期上升34.9％和20.8％。
    谈起经营之道，分管工业生产的镇长曾宪亮、副镇长田家宝一口气说出了不靠关系靠改革、不靠送礼靠质量、不靠吃喝靠信誉的“三靠三不靠”的经验。
    安岭渡水泥厂一度效益很好，曾是荆州地区先进企业。树大招风，一些“关系户”纷纷要求安排亲朋好友进厂。厂里为了搞活关系，安排了不少“关系户”进科室，科室非生产人员多达数十人。结果，企业不但没有“搞活”，反而挫伤了职工的积极性，一些技术和生产骨干纷纷外流，企业亏损50多万元。经调查了解，镇里其它企业也不同程度地面临着这些“关系户”的威胁。镇党委深知，仅靠企业的领导来抵制这些向企业伸手的“关系户”，力量是不够的，必须通过深化企业改革，让职工都来当家做主，共同抵制“裙带风”。去年初，17家镇办企业全部实行了全员风险抵押承包，削减了大批非生产人员，增强了职工的责任感，“关系户”再向企业伸手，职工们都有权过问、抵制。一些“关系户”看到这种状况，只好“免开尊口”。去年，全镇3个企业扭亏增盈，17个镇办企业都取得了较好的经济效益。
    有人说，企业的经济效益是靠花钱“送”出来、“吃”出来的。第二水泥厂正反两方面的经验教训，得出了相反的结论：只有靠质量和信誉，企业才能求生存。原任厂长由于经营思想偏差，忽视了技术人员的使用，放松了产品质量管理，借助于吃请送取得了“好”效益，但“好”景不长，终因产品质量低劣，造成一用户的危房倒塌，使厂里经济和信誉受巨大损失。新厂长刘敏善一上任，跳出吃请送的“怪圈”，请回一批外流的技术人才，埋头猛攻产品质量关，使产品合格率达到94％。去年10月，外地一家建筑公司从该厂购回一批安定性未到期的水泥，厂长刘敏善发现后，当晚和供销科长赶往这个公司，劝阻使用这批水泥，并采取了赔偿措施。建筑公司十分感动，不久，便与水泥厂签订了3000吨的长期供货合同。
    刘敏善就是这样，以质量取胜，靠信誉求生存，使这个濒临倒闭的企业起死回生。今年上半年，这个厂未请一桌客，未送一份礼，销售比去年同期上升119％。
    据镇里介绍，十几家镇办企业都被上级誉为“重合同守信用企业”。
    今年初，镇工办召开全年的磷矿石供货会，会期由原计划3天缩短为1天，到会的有12个省、直辖市的68个厂家负责人，还有地、县领导，席间六菜一汤，没备高级香烟和纪念品，住宿费自理。这次供货会仅开支4600元，比去年的订货会节约开支1.5万元。供货会除签订了30万吨磷矿石供货合同外，还争取到了100万元预付定金、80吨汽油、1460吨柴油和3000吨化肥等工农业生产紧缺物资。
