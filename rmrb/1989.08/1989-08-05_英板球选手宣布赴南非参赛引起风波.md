On August 1, 16 English cricket players announced that they would travel to South Africa in early 1990 and 1991 for two matches. This action violates the regulations of the International Cricket Council and has sparked widespread criticism both in the UK and abroad.

Due to the South African government's stubborn adherence to apartheid policies, most international sports organizations currently refuse to allow South African athletes to participate in international competitions and do not permit athletes under their jurisdiction to travel to South Africa. The International Cricket Council explicitly stated in January this year that any cricket player traveling to South Africa would automatically be disqualified from participating in international competitions for five years. This measure is quite severe. So, why are the English cricket players still determined to go? The reason is that South Africa is offering a large sum of money. It is reported that the 16 English cricket players will each earn $165,000 for their two trips to South Africa. Clearly, where there is a high reward, there are those who will take risks. On August 3, former English cricket team captain Mike Gatting, who will lead the team to South Africa, faced protests during a domestic match, with some demonstrators holding signs that read "dirty money" in protest.

However, the impact of this incident goes far beyond cricket. Colin Moynihan, the British Minister of State for Sport, pointed out, "If they (the cricket players) really go, this matter will have an impact beyond cricket... the entire British sports community and next year's Commonwealth Games will be affected." These words highlight the crux of the matter and the real concerns of those involved.

People still vividly remember that three years ago, because Britain refused to take measures to sanction South Africa, more than 30 Commonwealth member countries refused to participate in that year's Commonwealth Games, causing the host country Britain great embarrassment. Now, with the cricket incident causing another stir, will there be another wave of boycotts at next year's Commonwealth Games? People are paying close attention to this.

According to a recent statement by an anti-racism activist, African countries this time will change their strategy. They will attend the Commonwealth Games as scheduled in Auckland, New Zealand, while seeking to expel Britain from the Games. The outcome of the situation is currently uncertain.

### 英板球选手宣布赴南非参赛引起风波

    英板球选手宣布赴南非参赛引起风波
    8月1日16名英格兰板球选手宣布，将于1990年初和1991年两度去南非参加比赛。这一举动违反了国际板球联合会的有关规定，在英国内外引起一片非议。
    由于南非当局顽固坚持种族隔离政策，目前多数国际体育组织都拒绝南非选手参加国际比赛，也不允许本组织管辖下的运动员前往南非。国际板球联合会今年1月曾明确规定，任何前往南非的板球选手都将在5年之内被自动取消参加国际比赛的资格。应该说，这一措施是相当严厉的。那么，为什么英格兰的板球手们还要一意成行呢？原因是南非出了大价钱。据透露，英格兰16名板球手两度赴南非比赛，每人将可有16.5万美元的收入。可见，重赏之下必有铤而走险者。8月3日，将率队前往南非的前英格兰板球队队长麦克·盖廷等人在国内参赛，一些示威者手举写有“肮脏的钱”的标语牌以示抗议。
    然而，事情的影响远不止于此。英国负责体育事务的国务大臣科林·莫伊纳汉指出，“如果他们（板球选手）真的成行，这件事的影响将超出板球的范围……整个英国体育以及明年的英联邦运动会都将受到损害。”这番话道出了事情的焦点和有关人士真正的忧虑所在。
    人们仍然清楚地记得，3年前，由于英国拒绝采取措施制裁南非，30多个英联邦成员国拒绝参加当年的英联邦运动会，使主办国英国极为尴尬。现在，围绕板球事件又起风波，明年的英联邦运动会是否会再次出现抵制风潮呢？人们对此十分关注。
    据一位反种族歧视人士近日说，非洲国家这次将改变策略，它们将如期前往新西兰的奥克兰参加英联邦运动会，同时谋求把英国开除出运动会之外，事情前景如何，目前尚难预料。
