The first joint sales group in China's textile industry—the North China Five Provinces and Cities Textile Industry Joint Sales Group—has fully leveraged its cooperative advantages to facilitate information exchange, market expansion, and market activation for enterprises, demonstrating robust vitality.

The North China Five Provinces and Cities Joint Sales Group was established in 1987 with the support of over 700 textile enterprises from Beijing, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Yantai. The group has an annual output value of 12 billion yuan, with over 4 billion yuan worth of textile products entering the market through various sales activities organized by the group each year. This year, textile enterprises from Dalian and Shijiazhuang have also joined the group.

Cooperation facilitates market expansion. Last year, they held a nationwide order conference in Jiujiang, where products made a significant impact in the southern market, with a transaction volume of 430 million yuan. Through joint sales activities, production enterprises in various regions can also exchange new technologies, new products, and new information.

    北方五省市纺织业紧密合作
    联合销售　搞活流通
    本报讯　我国纺织工业企业第一个联销集团——北方五省市纺织工业联合销售集团，充分发挥联合的优势，为企业沟通信息、开拓市场、搞活流通显示出旺盛的活力。
    北方五省市联合销售集团是以北京、天津、黑龙江、吉林和烟台市的700多家纺织企业为后盾，于1987年组建起来的，年产值120亿元，每年有40多亿的纺织品货源通过集团组织的各种销售活动投入市场。今年大连和石家庄两市的纺织企业也加入了这个集团。
    联合起来有利于开拓市场。去年他们在九江举办了一次面向全国的订货会议，产品在南方市场一炮打响，成交额达4.3亿元。联合起来开展销售活动，各地生产企业还可以互相交流新技术、新产品和新信息。
