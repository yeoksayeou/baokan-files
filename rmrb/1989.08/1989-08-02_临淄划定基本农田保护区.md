Linzi Designates Basic Farmland Protection Area

	BEIJING, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Linzi District of Zibo City in Shandong Province has designated basic farmland protection areas, bringing land management under legal regulation and effectively solving the problem of arbitrary occupation and misuse of arable land.

	Linzi District is a grain-producing area and also a major national petrochemical base. In recent years, the conflict between increasing population and decreasing arable land has become increasingly pronounced. After completing the land survey, the district, in accordance with the overall land use plan, designated 524,400 mu (approximately 35,000 hectares) of basic farmland protection areas, accounting for 83 percent of the total arable land.

	The district government issued a "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Basic Farmland Protection Areas," stipulating that within the protection areas, it is prohibited to build residential houses or enterprises, to convert arable land into orchards or fish ponds, to excavate soil or sand, to burn bricks, to build graves, or to leave land fallow and idle.

    临淄划定基本农田保护区
    本报讯　山东省淄博市临淄区划定基本农田保护区，把土地管理纳入法制轨道，有效地解决了乱占滥用耕地的问题。
    临淄区是粮产区，又是国家大型石油化工基地。近几年来，人增与地减的矛盾越来越突出。为此，这个区在土地详查工作结束以后，按照本区土地利用的总体规划，划定了基本农田保护区52.44万亩，占总耕地面积的83％。
    区政府颁布《关于加强基本农田保护区管理的布告》，规定在保护区内不准建住宅、企业，不准毁田成片植树，不准建鱼藕池，不准毁田取土、取沙和烧砖瓦，不准建坟，不准撂荒闲置。
