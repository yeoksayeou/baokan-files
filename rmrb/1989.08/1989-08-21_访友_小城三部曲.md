Visiting a Friend
— A Triptych of a Small Town

Kites

Memory is the long line in my hand
Flying in the sky
The youth in his prime
Dancing gracefully
I blame you for being too fragile
Unable to withstand the wind's praise
The line in my hand broke, I heard you fell in a small town

The Small Town

The small town is like your appearance
No makeup or adornment
No flaunting of beauty
No pilgrims' worship
No devotees' blessings
You weren't like this when you first arrived in the small town
The small town made you pure and simple
The small town wasn't like this in the past either
Where did the town's scholarly voices come from?
Now you are a famous figure in the small town
Students spread across the country
At this moment, I feel the small town is too big
Not as good as your small study

The Small Room

Day and night
Lose their color within the small room
Reading books turns one's hair white
The shadow on the wall
Draws a curved bow
Time rushes on the bow
Stretching time into a line
Age is abandoned outside the door
Fame and wealth
Have long since fled
Discussing heroes over wine, words fall like rain
Falling all night
The window sill is wet in the morning
Pushing open the small room, one is greatly surprised
Half a century has passed

    访友
    ——小城三部曲
    木斧
    一、风筝
    记忆是我手中长长的线
    放飞天空
    那风华正茂的少年
    舞姿蹁跹
    怨你生来太轻薄
    经不住风的赞扬
    我手中的线断了，听说你落在一座小城中
    二、小城
    小城如你的相貌
    不涂脂抹粉
    不炫耀艳丽
    没有旅游者的朝拜
    没有进香人的祝愿
    你初坠小城可不是这个样儿
    小城把你磨纯朴了
    小城当年也不是这个模样
    哪来满城琅琅的读书声？
    如今你是小城的大名人
    桃李遍天下
    这时候我觉得小城太大了
    不如你一间读书的小屋
    三、小屋
    白昼和黑夜
    在小屋内失去颜色
    读书读白了头
    人影在粉墙上
    画出了弯曲的弓
    岁月在弓上急驰
    把时光拉成一条线
    年龄，被遗弃在门外
    功名与富贵
    早已逃之夭夭
    煮酒论英雄，话雨纷纷
    落了一夜
    一夜湿了窗棂
    推开小屋大吃一惊
    半个世纪流逝了
