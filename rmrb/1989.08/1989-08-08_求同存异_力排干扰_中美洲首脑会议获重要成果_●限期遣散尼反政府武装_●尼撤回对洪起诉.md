The Central American summit, held this afternoon in Tela, Honduras, on the Atlantic coast, has pushed the peace process in the region forward significantly. The five countries reached an agreement to voluntarily disband, repatriate, and resettle the Nicaraguan anti-government forces currently stationed in Honduras within 90 days. Nicaragua will withdraw its lawsuit against Honduras in the International Court of Justice in The Hague after the disbandment is implemented. The five countries also called on the Salvadoran guerrillas to abandon armed struggle, voluntarily disband, and join the national democratic legal process.

The fifth Central American summit, after three days of intense work, officially concluded this afternoon. The host, Honduran President Azcona, read the final document, the "Tela Declaration," along with two annexes: the "Joint Plan of the Five Central American Countries for the Voluntary Disbandment, Repatriation, and Resettlement of Nicaraguan Anti-Government Forces and Their Families" and the "Agreement Between Nicaragua and Honduras on the Lawsuit in the International Court of Justice."

The final document of the summit stated: "The five countries decide, in accordance with the provisions of the second Esquipulas (Central American Peace Agreement), not to use their territories to subvert other Central American countries. They will formulate a joint plan to voluntarily disband, repatriate, and resettle the Nicaraguan anti-government forces in Nicaragua or other third countries, and assist all individuals involved in armed actions in the region to voluntarily disband."

The additional documents of the meeting stipulate that starting from August 7, within 30 days, an "International Support and Supervision Committee" will be formed, including the United Nations Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States. This committee will persuade the Nicaraguan anti-government forces to accept disbandment and mediate with third countries to accept those who do not wish to return. The disbandment will be completed within 90 days, and international verification will be conducted within 180 days. Nicaragua will withdraw its lawsuit against Honduras, and friendly neighborly relations will be established.

The Central American summit opened on August 5. The presidents of Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica, with the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, overcame various interferences, and achieved significant results. Public opinion believes that this summit has created new conditions for the early realization of peace in the Central American region.
