The book "The Historical Path of China's Democratic Parties" edited by Wu Zhitang and Shen Yan, published by Shenyang Publishing House, comprehensively and systematically narrates the historical process of the birth, formation, and development of China's democratic parties. It scientifically evaluates their historical status and role during the periods of the Chinese revolution and construction. With compelling historical facts, it illustrates that the implementation of a multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is determined by China's national conditions. The formation, adherence, and improvement of this political system are a necessary requirement of China's historical and realistic conditions. The book covers the period from 1924 when Sun Yat-sen established the policy of allying with Russia, the Communist Party, and assisting the workers and peasants, and the initial formation of the democratic faction within the Kuomintang, up to December 1986. The materials are relatively systematic.
