The funeral of Comrade Tao Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, a member of the Financial and Economic Committee, and former Deputy Director of the State Commission for Economic System Reform, was held this morning at the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery in Beijing.

Leaders such as Li Peng, Wan Li, Li Xiannian, Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, Zhang Jinfu, Duan Junyi, Huang Zhen, Hab Comrade, Peng Chong, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Hanbin, and Gu Mu sent wreaths. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, and other units also sent wreaths.

Comrade Tao Li passed away in Beijing on July 26 at the age of 68. Tao Li was a native of Penglai County, Shandong Province. In his youth, he actively participated in anti-Japanese and national salvation activities and joined the Party in 1938. He served in various positions, including Secretary of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army Field Army, Secretary of the County Committee of Pingyin County and Tai'an County, Shandong Province. After the founding of New China, Tao Li successively held the positions of Deputy Director of the North China Machinery Bureau of the First Machinery Industry Department, Director and Party Secretary of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, Member and Party Group Member of the State Economic Commission, Second Secretary of the Party Committee of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Deputy Director and Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the State Materials Bureau, Deputy Director of the State Machinery Commission, and Deputy Director and Party Group Member of the State Commission for Economic System Reform. In March 1988, he was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress and a member of the Financial and Economic Committee.

Comrade Tao Li was always loyal to the Party and the people, with a firm stance and clear distinctions between right and wrong. He dedicated his life to the revolutionary and construction causes of the Party and the people. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he firmly implemented the basic line of "one center, two basic points," adhered to the four cardinal principles, insisted on reform and opening up, and resisted and opposed bourgeois liberalization. In the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, despite being seriously ill, he still cared deeply about the future and fate of the Party and the country. He clearly demanded that the Party Central Committee take decisive measures to stop the turmoil. He firmly supported the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Comrade Tao Li worked diligently throughout his life, adhered to principles, was upright and unyielding, and maintained the Party's tradition of hard struggle and excellent style.

Comrades Zhang Jinfu, Hab, Peng Chong, Ni Zhifu, and Chen Muhua attended the funeral of Comrade Tao Li today.
