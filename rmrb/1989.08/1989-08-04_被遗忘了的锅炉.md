The Forgotten Boilers

In April 1987, the Yingtan Railway Bureau purchased two brand-name boilers at a cost of tens of millions of yuan each and transported them to the Yingtan Station freight yard. Since then, no one has paid any attention to them. Later, the Yingtan Bureau was disbanded, and these two boilers have been left in the open grassy area of the freight yard, exposed to the sun and rain for over three years.

What is puzzling is: since the Yingtan Bureau has been disbanded, why hasn't the bureau's property and assets been promptly cleared and handed over? Instead, the problem has been left to the leaders in charge of the freight yard, making things difficult for others? The fact that these two boilers have been forgotten suggests that the former leaders of the Yingtan Bureau cannot simply brush it off as a matter of "negligence" or "momentary confusion," can they?

   被遗忘了的锅炉
    1987年4月，鹰潭铁路分局以每台数十万元的价格购进两台名牌锅炉，运到鹰潭车站货场后便无人过问。后来，鹰潭分局撤销，这两台锅炉就一直存放在货场露天草丛中，日晒雨淋，迄今已3载有余。
    令人不解的是：鹰潭分局既然撤销了，分局的物资财产为何没有及时清理、交割，却将问题遗留给主管货场的领导，令他人作难？这两台锅炉的被遗忘，原鹰潭分局的领导同志怕不是能用办事“疏忽”、一时“糊涂”所能开脱的吧！
