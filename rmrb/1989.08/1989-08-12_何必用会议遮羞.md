Title: Why Use Meetings to Cover Up Shame

Nowadays, many departments treat holding meetings as their primary work, and the number of meetings held in a year occupies a significant portion of the annual work summary.

However, the way some meetings are conducted is quite questionable. For example, meeting materials are already printed and ready, but a grand ceremony is still held to have leaders read them aloud. Another example is inviting some high-ranking officials to sit on the stage, who neither speak nor are relevant to the meeting. What is even more infuriating is that some people's intentions lie outside the meeting; after going through the formalities according to the agenda, they proceed to host grand banquets and distribute souvenirs. Such meetings, apart from wasting resources and breeding "meeting addicts," have what value?

In a sense, the "sea of meetings" is more harmful than the "mountain of documents." Reports and materials can be sent out, and the recipient can choose not to read them without affecting work; although paper is expensive, it is still cheaper than hundreds of tables of feasts. As for those who line up a strong lineup of attendees, they also spare the invitees the trouble of "being forced to attend," so it might as well be straightforward: if you want to invite someone to eat, just invite them to eat; if you want to give gifts, just give gifts. This way, both sides are convenient, and there is no need to use meetings to cover up shame.

As the pace of life continues to accelerate, those who make a living, enjoy, and delight in meetings should consider how to hold fewer meetings and hold better ones. Especially, they should exclude non-meetings from the circle. If this can be done, those strange symptoms of fearing meetings or rejoicing at meetings will surely be cured without treatment.

    何必用会议遮羞
    王亚平
    现在许多部门把开会当作主要工作，组织召开了多少次会议，在全年工作总结中占很大比重。
    但有些会的开法很值得商榷，比如：会议材料已经打印齐全，却兴师动众让些领导照本宣科念上一遍。又如：特邀一些大干部坐满主席台，既不发言又不相干。更可气的是有些人意在会外，照议程走完过场后即大摆宴席，大发纪念品。此种会议，除了劳民伤财、养殖“会虫”之外，还有什么价值？
    从某种意义上讲，“会海”比“文山”危害更大。简报、材料发下去，对方可以不看，不误工作；且虽言神州纸贵，毕竟贵不过成百上千桌的酒菜。至于排出强大列席阵容的，也免了被邀者“陪绑”之苦，倒不如想请吃的单纯请吃，要赠礼的直接赠礼，两下方便，不必以会遮羞。
    随着生活节奏的不断加快，那些以会为业、为生、为乐者们不妨探讨一下如何少开会、开好会，特别要将非会之“会”划出圈外。若能如此，那些闻会丧胆、闻会大喜等怪异病症定能不治自愈。
