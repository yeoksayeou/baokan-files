There is a strange theory circulating in today's society that seems to suggest that everything foreign is better, and that capitalism is superior to socialism. Is this really the case?

In late July, we discussed this issue, which has garnered significant public attention, with several experts and professors from the Beijing Military Area General Hospital who have studied, taught, conducted research, engaged in technical exchanges, and visited relatives and friends abroad. They stated that while they had witnessed the advanced industrial civilization of Western societies during their time abroad, they had also observed the hypocrisy and decadence of capitalist money-driven societies. The numerous facts they witnessed and heard firsthand led them to conclude that the moon overseas is not rounder than in China.

The supposedly free and equal American society is rife with inequality

Dǒng Xiùrú (Former Deputy Director of the Department of Anesthesiology. She went to the United States in 1987, where her brother is a government official in Maryland. Her recent research project on "the impact of anesthetic drugs on certain substances on red blood cell membranes" will fill a gap in domestic research): In the United States, although there are many Black people, the vast majority of them are discriminated against. They are treated unequally not only in terms of personal dignity and politics but also in terms of job positions and economic income. The phenomenon is very obvious in the George University Hospital where I studied. In the department where I was, there were more than 30 doctors, but not a single one was Black. Only a portion of the nurses were Black, and all the cleaning staff were Black. Doctors earn an annual salary of 130,000 to 150,000 US dollars, nurses 50,000 to 60,000 US dollars, and cleaning staff only 10,000 to 20,000 US dollars.

Jiǎ Fènglán (Associate Professor. She went to the University of Texas Molecular Medical Research Institute in 1984 to conduct postdoctoral research. In 1988, she received the third-class national health department Sun Family Encouragement Medical Research Fund and this year received the second-class military science and technology progress award. She stated): In the United States, regardless of who commits a crime, as long as they pay a corresponding ransom, they can be released. However, the ransom amount is usually astronomically high. For example, if a capitalist and a regular worker commit the same crime, the capitalist can pay tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in bail to secure their freedom, while the regular worker cannot afford this amount and is left to serve hard labor in prison. In other words, in capitalist countries, wealthy capitalists rarely go to jail. As for the "equality for all who step onto American soil" propaganda by American news media, it does not exist in the United States.

The self-proclaimed "guardians of human rights" in the United States are constantly violating human rights

Jiǎ Fènglán: In the United States, the personal rights of foreign researchers are often not protected. American law stipulates that the research results of foreign researchers in the United States can only be attributed to a certain American research institution when participating in international exhibitions and awards, and the nationality of the researchers cannot be mentioned. If you disagree, all your results will not be recognized. Their open theft of credit and reputation seriously infringes upon the rights of researchers. My mentor, Professor Huáng Zhēnxiáng, conducted molecular biology research in the United States in the early 1950s, which was considered the second milestone in biology by the international medical community and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. However, because he insisted on returning to serve the new China at that time, the United States canceled his nomination for the Nobel Prize in Medicine, depriving him of the highest honor in medical research.

Despite their material wealth, the spiritual emptiness and moral decay in these societies are shocking

Xú Shǎotīng (Chief Physician. One of the four members of the International Spinal Cord Injury Association in China, Director of the Military Trauma Orthopedics Research Center. He has received one second-class national progress award and four second-class military science and technology progress awards. He has visited and inspected the United States, Australia, and Hong Kong multiple times): During my technical exchange in the United States, I visited and inspected the U.S. Navy General Hospital, the U.S. Air Force General Hospital, and the NATO base hospital in Australia. In these three hospitals, I found alcohol treatment rooms, drug addiction treatment departments, and venereal disease specialty clinics. At the time, I was quite puzzled. On my second visit to the U.S. Navy General Hospital, I asked a friend accompanying me, "Why do military hospitals have such clinics and patients?" Seeing my surprised expression, he explained, "In the United States and its overseas bases, this is a common occurrence. Near our military camps at home and around our overseas bases, there are U.S. military clubs. On Saturdays or holidays, officers and soldiers can spend the night with female hosts. Because of this, 1/10 of the U.S. military has had venereal diseases. As for alcoholism and drug addiction, many of our children's hospitals have such specialties, let alone the military, which consists of young men."

Hú Míngdào (Chief Physician. Graduated from the Showa Medical College in Japan in the 1940s, he has visited Japan multiple times in recent years to visit relatives and friends and engage in academic exchanges. His "pleurodesis" has received a second-class military science and technology progress award): In such a highly developed country as Japan, there are temples and shrines everywhere, and even every family has an altar. Even on the world-famous modern street of Tokyo, Ginza, there are large and small temples visible everywhere, with daily activities of worshipping gods, seeking blessings, and fortune-telling. People in various professions worship their respective idols. Students worship Tenjin, farmers worship the rice god, and lovers worship the god of love. I asked a Chinese resident in Japan: In such a highly developed society as Japan, why do people seek help from spirits? They said, "In this world where people fight to the death for money, a person might be a millionaire today and bankrupt tomorrow. Everything seems colorful, but many people live very tired, difficult, and painful lives. In Japan, all interpersonal relationships, including those between fathers and sons and relatives, revolve around money. With theft, rape, and murder occurring every day, people have no choice but to seek the protection of God and spirits."

Cuí Jíjūn (Chief Physician. He has visited the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria as a member of the National People's Congress delegation for inspections and visits): During a visit to Hamburg, Germany, we stayed in a five-star international hotel near the "red-light district." The "red-light district" had public brothels, "sauna" baths offering male and female massages, striptease clubs, and bars where women accompany customers for drinks, all selling sex. The official in charge of our reception candidly introduced, "The 'red-light district' is officially tolerated, and many cities and tourist destinations have such places. All sexual behavior within the 'red-light district' is not subject to legal constraints, as long as you need it and have money, anyone can enter." I asked the official, "Where do the young women in the 'red-light district' come from? Isn't this a form of abuse against women?" He laughed and said, "Of course, they come from Southeast Asia, Africa, and some underdeveloped countries and backward regions in the world." He made a helpless gesture, "Poverty makes them willing to do anything for money." This is the cruel reality of the capitalist "paradise" that sings high about "human rights."

     外国月亮并不比中国的圆
    ——北京军区总医院一些从国外回来的专家教授谈西方金钱社会的虚伪性和腐朽性
    当今社会上有种怪论，似乎什么都是外国的好，什么都是资本主义比社会主义优越。真是这样吗？
    7月下旬，我们就这个颇为人们关注的问题，请教了北京军区总医院一些到国外留学深造、从事教学科研、技术交流及探亲访友的专家教授们。他们说，在国外，他们既看到了西方社会发达的工业文明，也看到了资本主义西方金钱社会的虚伪性和腐朽性。耳闻目睹的大量事实使他们深深感到：外国的月亮并不比中国的圆。
    标榜自由平等的美国社会，到处都存在着不平等
    董秀茹（麻醉科原副主任。1987年去美国，其兄是马里兰州政府官员。最近她搞的“麻醉药物对红细胞膜上某些物质的影响”研究项目将填补国内空白）：在美国，黑人虽然数量不少，但他们的绝大多数却受到歧视。不仅在人格上、政治上受到不平等的待遇，在工作地位和经济收入上也低人一等。我进修学习的乔治大学医院里，这种现象非常明显。我在的那个科，30多个医生没有一个黑人，护士里只有一部分黑人，清洁员则全是黑人；医生年薪为13—15万美金，护士5—6万美金，清洁员只有1万多美金。
    贾凤兰（副教授。1984年到美国得克萨斯州分子医学研究院从事博士后研究工作。1988年获得国家卫生部孙氏鼓励医学科研基金个人三等奖，今年又获得1989年军队科学技术进步二等奖）：在美国不论谁犯了罪，只要缴纳一笔相应的赎金就能获释。但赎金数额通常大得惊人。比如一个资本家和一个普通工人犯了同样的罪，资本家能够拿出几十万、上百万保释金使自己获得自由；而普通工人就拿不起这笔赎金，只有被囚禁在监狱里服苦役。就是说，在资本主义国家，腰缠万贯的资本家轻易是不会坐牢的。至于美国新闻媒介所宣扬的那种“踏上美国国土，人人享受平等”的事儿，在美国是根本不存在的。
    自封人权“保护神”的美国统治者，却处处干着侵犯人权的勾当
    贾凤兰：在美国，外籍科研人员的个人权益常常得不到保护。美国法律规定，外籍人员在美国搞出的科研成果，在参加国际展览和评奖时，只能写美国某某科研单位，不许标明研究人员的国籍，你不同意，就不承认你的一切成果。他们这种公开盗名窃誉的行为，严重地侵害了研究人员的权益。我的导师黄桢祥教授50年代初在美国搞的生物学分子研究，被国际医学界视为生物学的第二个里程碑，曾获得诺贝尔医学奖提名，就因为他当年坚持要求回国为新中国服务，美国就取消了他诺贝尔医学奖的提名，剥夺了他在医学研究上的最高荣誉。
    别看他们物质上富有，但精神空虚、道德沦丧的现象让人触目惊心
    胥少汀（主任医师。国际截瘫协会中国四名成员之一，全军创伤骨科研究中心主任。他的一项研究成果获国家进步二等奖，四项获军队科技进步二等奖。先后数次到美国、澳大利亚、香港访问考察）：我在美国从事技术交流期间，曾访问考察过美国海军总医院、空军总医院，在澳大利亚参观考察过北约部队基地医院。在这三所医院里，我发现都有酗酒治疗室、吸毒治疗科和性病专科。当时我非常不解。再次去美国海军总医院时，便问一位陪同的朋友，军队医院怎么会有这种科室、这样的病人？看到我惊讶的样子，他解释说：“在美国本土和驻外基地中这是很平常的事。在我们国内的军营附近和在国外的基地周围都有美军俱乐部，星期六或节假日的夜晚，军官和士兵都可以和女招待一起过夜。正因为如此，在美军中患过性病的占1／10。至于酗酒和吸毒，我们许多儿童医院都有这样的专科，何况军人都是年轻男子呢？”
    胡明道（主任医师。40年代毕业于日本昭和医学院，近几年多次去日本探亲访友，进行学术交流。他搞的“胸膜成型术”获军队科技进步二等奖）：在日本这样高度发达的国家里，到处是庙宇、神社，甚至每个家庭都有神坛。就连世界上著名的现代化大街——东京的银座，也是大庙、小庙抬头可见，天天有拜神求佛、烧香算命的活动。从事各种职业的人拜各自的偶像，上学的拜天满神，种庄稼的拜稻禾神，谈恋爱的拜亚日神。我问一个在日本定居的华人：在日本这样高度发达的社会里，为什么一切要求助于神灵呢？他们说，在这个为金钱斗得你死我活的世界里，一个人今天可能是百万富翁，兴许明天就会破产；看起来一切都五光十色，实际上很多人都活得很疲劳、很艰难、很痛苦。在日本，各种人际关系，甚至包括父子、亲朋之间都是以金钱为转移。加上偷盗、强奸、凶杀每天都在发生，人们只好求上帝和神灵来保佑自己。
      崔吉君（主任医师。曾作为人大代表团成员去过联邦德国、奥地利等国考察访问）：访问联邦德国时，我们住在汉堡旅馆，在那个五星级的国际旅馆附近就有“红灯区”。“红灯区”内有公开的妓女院、有提供男女按摩的“桑那”浴池、有脱衣舞厅、有女郎陪饮的酒吧等出卖色情的场所。负责接待我们的官员坦率地介绍：“红灯区是官方默许的，许许多多城市和旅游地都有这类场所。在“红灯区”内的一切性行为都不受法律的约束，只要你需要和有钱，什么人都可以进入。我问那位官员，“红灯区”内的年轻女性来自哪些地方？这不是对女性的一种摧残吗？他哈哈一笑：“当然是东南亚、非洲和世界上一些不发达的国家和落后地区。”他做出一个无可奈何的手势，“贫困使她们愿意为金钱去干一切。”这就是高唱“人权”的资本主义“天堂”极为残酷的现实。
