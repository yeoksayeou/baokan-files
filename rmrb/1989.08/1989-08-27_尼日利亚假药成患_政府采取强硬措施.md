The Nigerian military government has announced strong measures to combat the production, import, and sale of counterfeit drugs.

A decree issued by Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida today states that any individual or company found producing, importing, or selling prohibited or adulterated drugs will face a fine of 500,000 naira (approximately $70,000) or 15 years in prison, or both.

Furthermore, anyone selling any medication without the proper authorization from relevant authorities will be fined 5,000 naira (approximately $700) or sentenced to two years in prison, or both.

President Babangida also announced the establishment of federal and state special task forces to enforce this decree.

The proliferation of counterfeit drugs has become a serious social issue in Nigeria. According to investigations, half of the drugs sold in Nigerian markets are either counterfeit or do not meet standards. Since mid-July, the police have conducted large-scale operations, arresting 41 individuals, shutting down 9 pharmaceutical factories, and sealing hundreds of stores involved in the production and sale of counterfeit drugs.

    尼日利亚假药成患  政府采取强硬措施
    新华社拉各斯8月26日电　尼日利亚军政府宣布采取强硬措施，打击生产、进口和出售假药。
    尼日利亚总统巴班吉达今天发布的一项法令说，任何生产、进口或出售被禁止或搀假药品的个人或公司将被罚款50万奈拉（约合7万美元）或判以15年的徒刑，或者罚款和徒刑并判。
    此外，任何未经有关部门许可而兜售任何药品的个人将被处以5000奈拉（约合700美元）的罚款或两年徒刑，或者罚款和徒刑并判。
    巴班吉达总统还宣布成立联邦和各州特种部队，专门负责实施这项法令。
    假药成患，已成为尼日利亚严重的社会问题。据调查，尼日利亚市场上出售的药品中有一半是假药或不符合标准的药品。自7月中旬以来，警察采取了大规模的行动，逮捕了41人，关闭了9家制药厂，查封了数百家生产和出售假药的商店。
