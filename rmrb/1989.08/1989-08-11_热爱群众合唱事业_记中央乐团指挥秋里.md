One Sunday morning, I went to visit the renowned conductor of the Central Orchestra, Qiu Li, but found him absent. His wife told me that he had gone with the amateur chorus he conducts. She also mentioned that apart from his morning rehearsals and work at the orchestra, he dedicates all his remaining time to social work.

Indeed, this influential figure in the music world has been tirelessly dedicating his personal time and energy to the art of mass chorus over the past few years.

Qiu Li, though in his sixties, has a robust physique and the bearing of an athlete, appearing quite youthful. As early as 1954, he took on the role of conductor for the Red Flag Chorus, an amateur chorus organized by the Chinese Musicians Association. The members of the amateur chorus came from all directions, with varying levels of skill. Conducting them required a lot of gesturing and explaining, making it quite strenuous, but he never complained about the amateur chorus members. He said, "There are no unteachable choruses, only unqualified conductors." Because of his warm personality, lack of pretension, and willingness to come when asked, as well as his ability to tap into the potential of the chorus members and help them improve through artistic means, more and more amateur choruses invited him to be their conductor. Over the past decade, he has successively conducted the Beijing Workers Chorus, the Ministry of Culture Senior Cadres Chorus, the Teachers Chorus, and choruses composed of university students, middle school students, and elementary school students. He also frequently goes to factories, universities, cultural palaces, and cultural activity centers to teach music knowledge.

Through singing, he has come to understand the characteristics of workers, teachers, and students of different ages, and has enriched his artistic imagination. This has made him increasingly love the art of mass chorus and has also made him good friends with them.

For the sake of the amateur chorus, Qiu Li does not hesitate to ride his bicycle from his residence in the northeast corner of Beijing to various parts of the capital. One afternoon in 1986, after conducting a rehearsal with the Senior Cadres Chorus, it was already late. He hastily ate something on the street, looked at the time, and rushed to the Labor People's Cultural Palace on his bicycle. Due to the heavy traffic during rush hour, he fell and scraped his leg, bleeding quite a bit. Passersby advised him to go home and rest, but thinking of the hundred or so members of the Workers Chorus waiting for him, he endured the pain and arrived on time. It was not until he conducted the rehearsal over and over again, with blood seeping through his pants, that everyone noticed. They were deeply moved by the spirit of this dedicated and responsible conductor.

    热爱群众合唱事业
    ——记中央乐团指挥秋里
    张世英
  一个星期天的早晨，我去看望中央乐团著名指挥家秋里，不料扑了一个空。他的爱人告诉我，秋里指挥业余合唱团去了。她还告诉我，他除了上午在团里排练、工作，其它大部分时间全部用在社会工作上。
    的确，这位在音乐界有影响的指挥家，近年来总是这样不辞辛苦，牺牲个人时间，把全部精力献身于群众合唱艺术。
    秋里，虽已年届花甲，但体格健壮，很有运动员的风度，显得很年轻。早在1954年，他就担任了中国音协组织的由业余音乐爱好者参加的红旗合唱团的指挥。业余合唱团员来自四面八方，水平参差不齐，指挥他们要连说带比划，汗流浃背，十分吃力，然而他却从不埋怨业余合唱的团员，他说：“只有不称职的指挥，没有不可教的合唱团。”由于他为人热情，没有架子，一请就来，又善于挖掘团员的潜力，通过艺术手段使他们得到提高，所以请他担任指挥的业余合唱团也越来越多。近十年来，他先后担任了北京工人合唱团、文化部老干部合唱团、教师合唱团以及大学生、中学生、小学生等组成的合唱团指挥，还经常到工厂、大学、文化宫、群艺馆去讲授音乐知识。
    他通过歌唱手段，掌握了不同年龄的工人、教师、学生的特点，了解了各种形象、性格，丰富了自己的艺术想象，这使他越来越热爱群众的合唱艺术，还和他们成了好朋友。
    为了业余的合唱事业，秋里不辞辛苦骑着自行车，从自己的住处北京市区东北角往返于首都的各个角落。1986年的一天下午，他指挥老干部合唱团排练之后，天色已晚，在街上随便吃了一点东西，一看时间不早，就骑车急奔劳动人民文化宫。由于正是下班时间，人多车挤，他摔倒了，腿被蹭破，流了不少血。路人劝他赶快回家休息，可他想到一百来位工人合唱团的团员在等着自己去指挥，便忍着疼痛按时赶到了。直到他一遍又一遍地指挥练唱，血渗透了他的裤子，才被大家发现。他们深深为这位认真负责的指挥家精神所感动。
