After your newspaper published a letter to the editor titled "Investigate These Counterfeit TVs" on the fifth page on September 21 last year, our court conducted an investigation and found that the situation is basically true.

In March last year, Zhao Qingping, an individual business owner from Shiting Village, Xialing Township in our county, forged a contract to purchase 600 units of Xingxiang-brand black-and-white TVs from Shanghai Lianjiang Electrical Factory. He then forged another contract to purchase 600 units of Feiyue-brand black-and-white TVs from the same factory. Zhao used the fake contract to negotiate with the Qingshan Bridge District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, obtaining 250,000 yuan in advance payment. Subsequently, he obtained fake Feiyue-brand black-and-white TV labels, packaging boxes, manuals, and other items, and passed off 250 units of Xingxiang-brand black-and-white TVs as Feiyue-brand TVs to the Qingshan Bridge Supply and Marketing Cooperative. This batch of TVs caused over 50,000 yuan in losses to the Qingshan Bridge District Supply and Marketing Cooperative due to quality issues. Zhao illegally profited over 8,000 yuan, while two accomplices each profited over 2,000 yuan.

Zhao Qingping's actions have violated Article 127 of the Criminal Law, constituting the crime of counterfeiting trademarks. On May 3 this year, our court decided to arrest him according to law.

    冒牌电视机出笼经过已查明
    你报去年9月21日第五版刊登了读者来信《查查这批冒牌电视机》后，经我院立案侦查，情况基本属实。
    去年3月，我县霞岭乡石瑭村个体户赵清平，在与上海练江电器二厂签购600台星象牌黑白电视机合同后，伪造了一份与这个厂签购600台飞跃牌黑白电视机合同。赵持假合同与青山桥区供销社联系，骗得货款25万元。尔后，他搞来假飞跃牌黑白电视机商标、外包装箱、说明书等，将250台星象牌黑白电视机，冒充飞跃牌电视机交给青山桥供销社。这批电视机因质量问题给青山桥区供销社造成5万多元的损失。赵从中非法获利8000多元，两个合谋者分别获利2000多元。
    赵清平的行为已触犯刑法第127条，构成假冒商标罪。今年5月3日，我院决定对其依法逮捕。
