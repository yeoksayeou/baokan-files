Valuable Resources for Studying and Researching the Party's Historical Experience: The "Collection of Central Committee Documents" to be Published Openly

The "Collection of Central Committee Documents" (Pre-Liberation Period) will be published openly starting this year. This is a valuable resource for studying and researching the Party's historical experience.

Approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, edited by the Central Archives, reviewed by the Central Party Literature Research Office, and published by the Central Party School Press, this large-scale collection will be published openly both domestically and internationally. The collection spans from 1921 to 1949 and includes 17 volumes with over 7 million words.

This collection of documents was compiled by the Central Archives starting in 1986, based on the original internal edition. It includes a wide range of materials collected, excavated, organized, and edited by the Central Archives. The collection features major documents issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China before liberation, including important reports, resolutions, proposals, directives, telegrams, and drafts.

The key features of this publication are as follows:

(1) The documents are strictly compiled according to the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and respecting history. All included documents are printed based on the original historical records, preserving their original form.

(2) The selection of versions and textual collation is meticulous. The collection primarily uses historical originals. If originals are not available, the most reliable versions are used as the base. In textual collation, after careful verification and research, errors, omissions, and typos in the originals are clearly marked with proofreading symbols and corrected or supplemented.

(3) A large number of additional documents have been included. The original internal edition consisted of 14 volumes with approximately 60 million words. This open edition, covering the period from 1921 to 1949, has added many documents, resulting in 17 volumes with over 70 million words. Many historical documents that have never been publicly released before are now fully included.

(4) To facilitate readers, experts and scholars from the Central Archives, Central Party School, and Central Party Literature Research Office have provided concise annotations.

The open publication of the "Collection of Central Committee Documents" is a significant event that will have a profound impact on strengthening the Party's political and ideological work.

The first batch of volumes 1-6 of the "Collection of Central Committee Documents" will be published in September this year.
