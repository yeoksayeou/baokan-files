Daiyun Mountain in autumn is like a cool dream.

To collect plant specimens, I ventured into Daiyun Mountain. The lush forests surrounding the mountain form deep blue and light green pools in the hollows, quiet and serene, making one feel like a small boat drifting into a world painted with trees, vines, grass, and flowers. In the autumn sun, the cuckoos lead the way, casting a dream-like glow. I frequently pick the medicinal plants that lie along the path, feeling like Ali Baba discovering a treasure trove, intoxicated, as if I had become a mythical figure myself.

Suddenly, a dawn redwood—a living fossil—appeared before me. As I was intently observing it, the bushes a few meters away rustled, and a sika deer with magnificent antlers leaped out. It glanced at me briefly before disappearing like the wind. I looked towards where the deer had come from, and the flowers in the trees swayed again. A girl in a white shirt with blue floral patterns emerged from the bushes, barefoot, with her pants rolled up to her calves, and jumped to the clear stream.

I approached her and struck up a conversation. I learned that she was a deer herder. As she washed, beads of water rolled down her neck from under her tousled black hair, the clear spring water reflecting her perfectly proportioned waist. The deer park on Daiyun Mountain has been practicing the northern deer southern breeding method for six years, and the eight sika deer from Jilin have grown to over sixty. The girl, with her red lips and white teeth, spoke passionately about raising deer, gesturing enthusiastically: "Deer have excellent memories. They remember the paths they take when they go out and return the same way. The lead deer is very diligent; as long as it is in the pen, you don't need to count the others. When the male deer grow antlers, they become very docile. They don't fight or make noise, fearing injury to their antlers. They often go to the spring to admire their reflections, like young ladies who love to preen. Do you believe it?"

The girl let out a sharp whistle, and the leaves rustled as the deer herd gathered. The male deer that had glared at me earlier approached the girl and rested its head on her high chest. "Look, that's the lead deer!" the girl said, a bit coquettishly, but she stroked the deer's neck repeatedly. Behind her, on the sunlit grass, the deer were either frolicking, grazing, or lost in thought...

The leaves of the soapberry tree had turned yellow, shiny and bright, making a racket; wild chrysanthemums bloomed modestly everywhere, their petals slightly open; there were also unknown wild fruits, hanging on the trees and the ground like plump exclamation marks. The autumn fields of Daiyun Mountain were heavy with fruit, filled with a fragrant aroma.

I then turned to the open valley. In a short while, a green kingfisher flew swiftly past the treetops, the mist gradually returning to chaos, and then the rain poured down, pounding the leaves like popping beans. Daiyun Mountain was shrouded in a gray rain curtain. A young man rushed out from a small grass hut by the forest and pulled me inside to chat.

The young man was also a deer herder. He was harvesting soybeans on the front mountain: "Sika deer need to be fed high-quality feed when they grow antlers. We also plant chestnuts and tea to increase income and expand the deer park." The young man's right hand was wrapped in bandages, thin but energetic. He talked to me about the work in the deer park: cutting wood, building deer pens, herding in the wild, protecting the fawns in winter, and collecting grass leaves, among other things. "Of course, it's hard work, but selling six catties of deer antlers can buy a mountain tractor!" I talked with the young man about the girl and her pride in her work. The young man said with concern, "It's not that easy. She has cried before. That lead deer was very wild, but she insisted on taming it. She fell and rolled for eight or nine days, her knees were scraped raw, and she almost had to be carried out of bed."

"Who are you talking about? Tell me!" Amidst the rain, the girl happened to barge into the grass hut, carrying a large bundle of deer grass, her clothes soaked and clinging to her body, yet she still giggled non-stop.

"About a wild girl!" The young man quickly started a fire, letting me warm up first. Although he didn't look at her, he seemed fair, but I knew the fire was for the girl.

Sitting by the fire, I understood their relationship. The young man was originally a city worker, now learning to herd deer here. The girl's father was the young man's mentor. I had only heard of rural girls going to the city, but today I saw a city boy going to the countryside. A little hard work and fatigue, what's the big deal? In the changing society, he was seeking his own life value.

The rain clouds scattered, coming like lightning and disappearing like a storm. The young people rushed out like birds leaving their cages. The young man first climbed the steep rocks and then pulled the laughing girl up. Below the mountain, there was a vast world, deer pens, villages, clear springs, and the distant city hidden among the green trees. The two stood under the blue sky, like a long green vine entwined with a red maple tree. The lead deer wandered behind them, tame.

"In the future, we could build a sika deer research institute here, wouldn't that be great!" The gentle mountain breeze brought soft whispers, the voice becoming smaller and smaller, like the fragrance of orchids, like the affection between clouds and mountains.

The sky cleared, and the green birds flew far away over the lake. I descended the wet mountain path, the air after the rain filled with the fragrance of a thousand flowers and grasses. The sinqiu flowers on the tall trees held up their bright red "brush tips," writing the emotions of Daiyun Mountain. The larks sang joyfully in the blue sky, singing this new song of deer herding.

    戴云山牧鹿人
    林万春
    秋天的戴云山，是一个清凉的梦。
    为采集植物标本，我进了戴云山。环山的葳蕤林莽在凹地上漾出一个个阒寂的“潭”，深蓝浅碧，渺渺幽幽，人便似独木舟，漂进树、藤、草、花浓抹而成的世界。秋阳中，斑鸠领着路，折射着梦似的光晕。我频摘匍匐一路的药用植物，像阿里巴巴叩开宝窟，心醉醉的，好似自己也成了神话中人。
    一株水杉——活化石，蓦地出现在我的面前，正当我怀着浓厚的兴趣观望它的时候，数米外的灌木丛飒飒摇动，一头梅花鹿顶着珊瑚大角猛蹿出来。它对我稍作张望，便如风遁去。我向鹿回头处看，林间又一片花摇动起来。树丛中转出个穿白底蓝花格子衫的女孩子，裸着双足，裤筒卷到小腿上，一路蹦到清清涧水边。
    我上前攀谈，才知道她是牧鹿的姑娘。洗濯之中，她蓬松乌发下的脖颈不时滚下一粒粒水珠，清泉泠泠，映出那恰到好处的腰身。戴云山鹿园，进行北鹿南养已经六年了，8只吉林梅花鹿发展到60多头。牧鹿姑娘唇红齿白，说起养鹿神采飞扬，直打手势：“鹿记性可好，出门走哪条道，回家还照原样走。头鹿看群可尽心了，入栏只要看它在，那就不用点数。公鹿到长茸时才乖呢，它们不打不闹，怕伤茸，还常到泉边照影子，像女儿家爱花俏，你信不信？”
    姑娘打了个响亮的呼哨，落叶沙沙作响，鹿群拢了过来，刚才瞪过我一眼的雄鹿，走到姑娘面前，放肆地把头倚在她高高的胸脯上。“你看，它就是头鹿！”姑娘不无几分娇嗔，却频频摩挲着鹿颈。后面洒满阳光的草地上，鹿们有的在撒欢，有的在嚼草，有的则像在沉思……
    眼前皂荚树叶黄了，像打上蜡，鲜亮亮地喧哗；到处有野菊花矜持的笑影，芳唇微启；还有不知名的野果，树上树下垂挂着肥硕的“惊叹号”。戴云山的秋野是沉甸甸的，充满沁心的芳芬。
    我又转到开阔的山坳。一会儿工夫，长嘴翠鸟惊叫着掠过枝梢，山岚氤氲，渐归混沌，随即雨点“蓬蓬”地砸向草叶，变成炒豆子般的急骤，戴云山整个拉起灰蒙蒙的雨幔。林边的小草寮里冲出个小伙子，把我拉了进去闲聊。
    小伙子也是牧鹿人，他在前山收大豆：“梅花鹿长茸得喂精料，我们也栽棕种茶，为了增加收入，扩大鹿园。”小伙子右手掌缠着纱布，清瘦而精干，他和我谈起鹿园的活计，砍木头、搭鹿栅，野外放牧，越冬护羔，采草叶等等。“当然是苦，不过出口六斤鹿茸，能换回一台山地拖拉机呢！”我和小伙子谈到那姑娘，谈到她对牧鹿的自豪，小伙子心疼地说：“没那么好玩，她可是哭过鼻子的。那只头鹿原来可野了，她偏要去驯，跌跌滚滚了八九天，膝盖头都被磨破了，差点叫人抱着下床。”
    “你说我啥？说说！”夹着雨点，那姑娘正巧闯进草寮，她抱着一大捆鹿草，衣裳冷渍渍地贴着，竟还咯咯笑个不停。
    “我在说一个野姑娘！”小伙子很快生起一堆炭火，让我先去烤烤。虽然他目不斜视，貌似公允，但我明白这火是他为姑娘生的。
    火边围坐，我才明白他们之间的关系。小伙子原是城里的工人，现在到这里学牧鹿，姑娘的阿爸，就是小伙子的师傅。过去光听乡下姑娘进城，今天却看到城里小伙子下乡，苦点累点又算啥，在社会变化中，他寻觅着自己的人生价值呢。
    浮云带雨，来如闪电，去似彪风。年轻人像小鸟出笼般扑出去，小伙子先攀上巉岩，又回身拉住笑嚷嚷的姑娘。山下有广阔的世界，鹿栏、村舍、清泉以及绿树隐隐的远方城市。两个人站在蓝天下，像一缕长青藤挽住一株丹枫树。那只头鹿温驯地在他们身后转悠。
    “将来在这里盖个梅花鹿的研究所，多好！”习习山风送来喁喁低语，声音越来越小，像带着幽兰的气息，像云与山的依恋。
    天放晴了，绿鸟向湖塘远飞，我沿着湿漉漉的山道下山，雨后的空气里散发着千花百草的清芬，高树上的辛夷花举着鲜红的“笔毫”，抒写着戴云山的情愫。云雀在蓝天上拍翅欢叫，唱着这崭新的牧鹿之歌。
