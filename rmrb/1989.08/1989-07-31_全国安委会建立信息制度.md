To timely and accurately grasp the occurrence of various types of injuries, fatalities, and occupational diseases nationwide, the National Safety Production Commission recently established an information system.

The establishment of this system will facilitate the dissemination of information from the top down and from the bottom up, enabling relevant departments of the State Council to comprehensively, coordinate, and research major safety production issues. The system stipulates that the National Safety Commission will promptly report to local authorities on the safety production situation, including instructions and opinions from leaders on safety production, key areas of safety production work, and related information. At the same time, it requires local safety commissions to promptly report to the National Safety Commission on major injuries and fatalities in industries such as mining, railways, highways, waterways, civil aviation, and fires, and to regularly submit safety assessment reports for local areas and key industries.
