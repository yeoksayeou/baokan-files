Qingdao, known as the "Pearl of the Yellow Sea," has gained fame both domestically and internationally, largely due to its products. Apart from well-known products like Qingdao Beer, the city has recently seen the rise of new products such as the "Qingdao-Liebherr" refrigerators, Qingdao-brand televisions, Qingdao-brand 135 cameras, split-type air conditioners, "Qingdao-Sharp" washing machines, and Qingdao Chardonnay dry white wine. These products have frequently won awards both domestically and internationally, adding luster and vibrancy to Qingdao. Qingdao residents refer to these new products as the "proud offspring of reform and opening up." From these products, one can see Qingdao's strides in catching up with advanced global technologies through opening up.

Scenic beauty, pleasant climate, excellent harbor, and a relatively strong industrial base—these were once the advantages that Qingdao residents took pride in. However, after implementing the policy of opening up to the outside world, Qingdao residents, with a global perspective, deeply felt that Qingdao had fallen behind. Statistics from 1981 showed that in Qingdao's light industry system, 34% of the equipment was from before the 1950s; in the textile system, 57% of the old spinning frames and 31% of the old looms were from before the 1950s. In May 1984, Qingdao City formulated a plan focusing on utilizing foreign capital, introducing technology, and transforming old enterprises, determined to catch up with advanced global technologies.

Qingdao City's technology introduction work has its own characteristics. Firstly, it insists on a high starting point in technology, emphasizing both the practicality and forward-looking nature of the technology. Since 1984, Qingdao City has cumulatively completed 497 technology projects with foreign partners, 86% of which are at the international technological level of the late 1970s or early 1980s.

Secondly, it insists on combining introduction with digestion and absorption, accelerating the pace of domestication while introducing technology. Currently, the domestication rate of 47cm color TV components is 91%, 135 cameras is 55%, air conditioners is 35%, refrigerators is 80%, and washing machines has reached 100%.

Taking the path of opening up and introduction has enabled Qingdao's production technology in most industries to achieve leapfrog progress. Currently, more than half of the city's large and medium-sized enterprises have upgraded their technological equipment from the pre-1950s level to the international level of the late 1970s or early 1980s. The leap in technological levels has brought about improvements in product quality, an increase in new-generation products, and an expansion in foreign exchange earnings from exports. Qingdao's industrial production has entered a period of vigorous development. Last year, the total value of exported goods reached 1.95 billion yuan, an increase of 1.2 times compared to 1984. The city's total industrial output value reached 21.02 billion yuan, with a net increase of over 100 billion yuan in three years, equivalent to the development level of the 36 years since the founding of the nation.

    青岛——对外开放的窗口
    陈大良
    一个作家的知名度来自于他的作品，一个城市的知名度也往往来自于它的产品。青岛，被誉为“黄海明珠”，扬名国内外，多半也源于此，且不说青岛啤酒等老产品，单是近几年崛起的“琴岛——利勃海尔”电冰箱、青岛牌电视机、青岛牌135照相机、分体式空调器、“琴岛——夏普”洗衣机、青岛查当尼干白葡萄酒等在国内外频频获奖的新产品，确为青岛增了光，添了彩。青岛人把这些新产品称为“改革开放的骄子”。从这些“骄子”身上，可以看到青岛市在开放中赶超世界先进技术的脚印。
    风光秀丽，气候宜人，港湾良好，工业基础比较雄厚，这曾是青岛人引为自豪的优势。可是，实行对外开放以后，青岛人放眼世界，深切地感到：青岛落后了。1981年的统计数字表明：青岛轻工系统，50年代前的老设备占34％；纺织系统50年代前的旧纱锭占57％，旧布机占31％。1984年5月，青岛市制订了以利用外资、引进技术、改造老企业为重点的方案，决心追赶世界先进技术。
    青岛市的技术引进工作具有自己的特点。首先是技术上坚持高起点，既注重技术的实用性，也注重技术的超前性。1984年以来，青岛市累计对外成交技术项目497项，其中86％属于国际70年代末或80年代初的技术水平。
    再是坚持引进同消化吸收相结合，在引进的同时加快国产化的步伐。目前，引进的47厘米彩电零部件国产化已达91％，135照相机达55％，空调器达35％，电冰箱达80％，洗衣机达到100％。
    走开放、引进之路，使青岛大部分行业的生产技术实现了跳跃式前进，目前全市一半以上的大中型企业的技术装备已由50年代前的水平，跃为国际70年代末或80年代初的水平。技术水平的飞跃，带来了产品质量的提高、换代产品的增加和出口创汇的扩大，青岛市工业生产进入了一个蓬勃发展的新时期。去年，全市出口商品收购总值达19.5亿元，比1984年增长1.2倍，全市工业总产值达到210.2亿元，3年净增100多亿元，相当于建国后36年的发展水平。
