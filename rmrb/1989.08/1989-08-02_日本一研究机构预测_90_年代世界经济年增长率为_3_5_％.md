A Japanese private research institution, the National Economic Research Association, recently released a report stating that the global economy will experience an annual growth rate of approximately 3.5% in the 1990s.

The research report points out that the reasons for the smooth growth of the global economy in the 1990s are as follows: first, the trend of easing relations between the East and the West; second, the global trend of privatization and deregulation has enhanced market vitality; third, the practical application of new technologies in industry; fourth, the rise of the Asian newly industrialized economies and ASEAN countries, as well as the implementation of economic opening policies by socialist countries; fifth, the trend towards unification of the world market, such as the European Community, has expanded the scope of economic activities.

The report believes that the U.S. economy has begun to achieve a "soft landing," and will realize an annual growth rate of 2% to 3% in the 1990s, eliminating both fiscal and trade deficits by the end of the century. During this period, Japan will accelerate technological innovation, with both personal consumption and equipment investment booming, and the national economic development speed will reach 4.8%. China's economy will maintain an average annual growth rate of approximately 4% to 5.5% over the next decade or so by the end of the century. The Soviet Union's economic growth rate during the same period will be around 2.5%.

    日本一研究机构预测
    90年代世界经济年增长率为3.5％
    本报讯　日本民间研究机构国民经济研究协会日前发表的一份报告认为，世界经济在90年代将出现年率约3.5％的高速经济增长。
    研究报告指出，90年代世界经济顺利增长的理由是：一、东西方关系趋于缓和的潮流；二、世界性的民营化和放宽限制的潮流增强了市场活力；三、新技术在工业中的实际应用；四、亚洲新兴工业经济群体、东盟国家经济的崛起和社会主义国家实行经济开放政策；五、欧洲共同体等世界市场趋于统一，扩大了经济活动范围。
    报告认为，美国经济开始实现“软着陆”，90年代将实现年率2％～3％的增长，至本世纪末将消除财政和贸易双赤字；这一期间日本将加快技术革新，个人消费和设备投资双旺，国民经济发展速度将达4.8％；中国经济到本世纪末的10余年内，经济发展速度平均约为4％到5.5％。苏联在同一期间的经济增长率约为2.5％。
