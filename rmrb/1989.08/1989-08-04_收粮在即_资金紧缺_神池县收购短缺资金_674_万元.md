	Grain procurement is imminent, but funds are short. Shenqi County is short of 6.74 million yuan for grain procurement.

	This year, the grain and oil crops in our county are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The county needs 10.02 million yuan for grain and oil procurement, but there is at least a shortfall of 6.74 million yuan. Although the relevant departments of the county have made every effort, by mid-July, the shortfall in funds has still not been resolved. If this situation continues, our county will have to issue IOUs for grain and oil procurement, and the farmers in the entire county are worried, while the government is concerned about not being able to complete this year's grain and oil procurement task.

    收粮在即　资金紧缺
    神池县收购短缺资金674万元
    我县今年粮油作物长势喜人，丰收在望。全县需要收购粮油资金1002万元，收购粮油资金至少短缺674万元。县有关部门虽经多方努力，到7月中旬，短缺的资金仍无着落。照此下去，我县收购粮油不得不打白条，全县农民忧心忡忡，政府担心完不成今年的粮油收购任务。
