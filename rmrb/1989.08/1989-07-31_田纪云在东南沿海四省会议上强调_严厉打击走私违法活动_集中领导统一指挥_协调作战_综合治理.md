    Tian Jiyun, Vice Premier of the State Council, emphasized at today's opening of the meeting on combating smuggling in the four coastal provinces of the southeast that severely cracking down on illegal smuggling activities is an important measure to implement the speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the Fourth Plenum. It is a crucial part of rectification and combating corruption, and it is of great significance for safeguarding national interests and ensuring the smooth progress of economic construction and reform and opening up. This must be taken seriously and handled promptly.

    Tian Jiyun pointed out that the smuggling problem in some regions is currently quite serious. It not only seriously damages national interests and disrupts economic order but also severely undermines the construction of spiritual civilization and corrupts social morals. It is a reflection of class struggle in the economic and ideological domains.

    He pointed out that "one center, two basic points" is the basic line determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress, which must be firmly and unwaveringly implemented. To implement the basic line of the Thirteenth Party Congress and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up, we must adhere to Deng Xiaoping's proposal of "two hands." That is, one hand to promote reform and opening up, and the other hand to severely crack down on economic crimes; one hand to promote material civilization, and the other hand to promote spiritual civilization. Neither can be neglected, and we cannot be strong in one hand and weak in the other. It must be made clear that the reform and opening up we advocate is under the leadership of the Communist Party, adhering to the socialist path, opening the door to the world, and activating the economy. We selectively introduce advanced technology and scientific management methods from abroad, but we absolutely do not allow any backdoor deals, speculation, smuggling, or decadent practices. We will not allow our country to be led down the capitalist road. Therefore, we must adopt a resolute attitude and powerful measures to severely crack down on smuggling activities, suppress their arrogance, and fight to the end.

    Tian Jiyun demanded that all regions must concentrate leadership, unify command, coordinate operations, and comprehensively manage smuggling activities. We must persist in regular efforts. The anti-smuggling struggle in Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, and Zhejiang, the four southeastern coastal provinces, must be strengthened, and other regions must not relax their efforts. We must strictly administer according to law and handle cases according to law. For smuggling cases that violate administrative regulations and criminal laws, they must be seriously dealt with. For enterprises, institutions, and organizations involved in smuggling, in addition to confiscating the smuggled goods and imposing fines according to law, if any Communist Party members are involved in smuggling activities, they must be disciplined according to party regulations, and their supervising officials and directly responsible persons must be held criminally liable. For smugglers with serious offenses and repeated violations, they must be severely punished. We must strengthen public supervision and transparency in law enforcement, and extensively and deeply carry out propaganda and education for the anti-smuggling struggle.

    Dai Jie, Director of the General Administration of Customs and Chairman of the National Anti-Smuggling Coordination Group, presided over today's meeting and delivered a speech.

    田纪云在东南沿海四省会议上强调严
    厉打击走私违法活动
    集中领导统一指挥　协调作战　综合治理
    本报北京7月31日讯　记者梅洪如报道：国务院副总理田纪云在今天开幕的东南沿海4省打击走私工作会议上强调，严厉打击走私违法活动，是贯彻落实邓小平同志讲话和四中全会精神的重要措施，是治理整顿、惩治腐败的重要内容，对维护国家权益、保证经济建设和改革开放顺利进行具有重要意义，必须认真抓紧抓好。
    田纪云指出，当前一些地区的走私问题相当严重。它不仅严重损害国家权益，扰乱经济秩序，而且严重地破坏精神文明建设，败坏社会风气，是阶级斗争在经济领域和政治思想领域中的反映。
    他指出，“一个中心、两个基本点”是十三大确定的基本路线，必须坚定不移地贯彻执行。为了贯彻十三大基本路线，保证改革开放顺利进行，必须坚持邓小平提出的“要两手抓”。即一手抓改革开放，一手抓严厉打击经济犯罪；一手抓物质文明建设，一手抓精神文明建设。二者不可偏废，不能一手硬一手软。必须明确，我们所说的改革开放，是在共产党领导下，坚持社会主义道路，打开国门，搞活经济，有选择地引进国外的先进技术和科学管理方式，而决不允许搞邪门歪道，搞投机倒把，搞走私贩私和腐化堕落的那一套，更不允许把我们的国家引到资本主义道路上去。因此，我们必须以坚决的态度、有力的措施，狠狠地打击走私贩私活动，把他们的嚣张气焰压下去，将斗争进行到底。
    田纪云要求各地要集中领导，统一指挥，协调作战，对走私贩私活动进行综合治理。要坚持经常抓。广东、福建、海南、浙江东南沿海4省的反走私斗争要加强，其它地区也不能放松。要严格依法行政，依法办案。对触犯行政法规和触犯刑律的走私案件，要严肃处理。对参与走私的企事业单位、机关团体，除依法没收走私货物并处以罚金外，凡是共产党员参与走私活动的，要给予党纪处分，还要追究其主管人员和直接责任人的刑事责任。对情节严重、屡教不改的走私犯罪分子，要严加惩办。要加强舆论监督和执法透明度，广泛深入地开展反走私斗争的宣传教育。
    海关总署署长、全国打击走私协调小组组长戴杰主持了今天的会议并讲了话。
