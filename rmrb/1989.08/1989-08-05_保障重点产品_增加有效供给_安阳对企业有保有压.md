AnYang implements a policy of "support and pressure" for industrial production, promoting product structure adjustments and supporting the development of key products and enterprises. In the first half of this year, the city's marketable products increased by 10.9% compared to the same period last year. The city's total industrial output value and budgeted industrial profits increased by 6.9% and 5.87% respectively.

At the beginning of this year, AnYang conducted a survey of 124 enterprises to identify 46 key products and 44 key enterprises. These enterprises received priority in funding, electricity, and raw materials. Production of long-term surplus and unsold products was strictly halted.

This policy has led to a balanced development of light and heavy industries in the city. Most raw materials, energy, agricultural support, and some light industrial and electronic products with high market demand have seen increased production, thereby increasing the effective supply in the market.

    保障重点产品　增加有效供给
    安阳对企业有保有压
    本报讯　河南省安阳市对工业生产实行“有保有压”的倾斜政策，促使产品结构调整，扶持发展了一批重点产品、重点企业。今年头6个月，该市适销对路产品比去年同期增产10.9％，工业总产值、预算内工业实现利润分别比去年同期增长6.9％、5.87％。
    今年初，安阳市根据市场需求，对124户企业进行了摸底调查排队，确定46种重点产品和44个重点企业，在资金、电力、原材料等方面给予优先安排照顾。对于市场长期积压滞销的产品，坚决停止生产。
    倾斜政策使该市轻重工业协调发展，原材料、能源、支农及部分市场需求较大的轻纺和电子产品多数超产，增加了市场有效供给。
