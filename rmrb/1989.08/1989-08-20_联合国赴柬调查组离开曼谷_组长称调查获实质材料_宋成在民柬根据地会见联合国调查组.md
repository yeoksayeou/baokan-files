The United Nations investigation team led by Major General Martin Weedsette left Bangkok this evening for Paris, France, to report their findings to the UN Secretary-General and the Paris International Conference on Cambodia.

Weedsette told reporters at the airport, "We have a written report," which will be directly submitted to UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

When asked by a Xinhua News Agency reporter, Weedsette said, "We were deeply impressed by what we saw and heard. This was a very substantive investigation." He declined to comment on how to distinguish between Vietnamese disguised as Cambodians and genuine Cambodians, and refused to disclose more details. He said that the substantive materials are not suitable for disclosure at this time.

The Democratic Kampuchea Radio broadcasted today that the Minister of the International Committee of the United Front for the Struggle of the Kampuchean People and Commander-in-Chief of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, Song Chan, met with the entire delegation of the UN investigation team led by Major General Martin Weedsette on August 17th in a base area controlled by the Democratic Kampuchea.

Song Chan stated during the meeting that the tasks of the UN international supervisory body should include supervising the withdrawal of 1 million openly and covertly stationed Vietnamese in Phnom Penh's fake army and residents from Cambodia, and supervising the various weapon storage points set up by Vietnam in Cambodia.

Song Chan reiterated that the Democratic Kampuchea side advocates for the UN to dispatch an international supervisory group and peacekeeping forces. He believes that effective supervision can only be achieved if the future interim government led by Prince Sihanouk, representing the four parties, is allowed to participate in the supervision.

According to the Democratic Kampuchea Radio broadcast, Song Chan also introduced the situation of the guerrilla bases of the Cambodian resistance forces and the distribution of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.

    联合国赴柬调查组离开曼谷
    组长称调查获实质材料
    宋成在民柬根据地会见联合国调查组
    据新华社曼谷8月19日电  （记者马胜荣）由马丁·韦德塞特中将率领的联合国赴柬埔寨实地调查组今天晚上离开曼谷前往法国巴黎，向联合国秘书长和讨论柬埔寨问题的巴黎国际会议报告调查结果。
    韦德塞特在机场对记者说：“我们已经有了一份书面报告”，这份报告将直接交给联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔。
    在回答新华社记者时，韦德塞特说：“我们对所见所闻印象很深，这是一次富有实质性的考察。”他不愿就如何区别伪装成柬埔寨人的越南人和真正的柬埔寨人作出评论，并拒绝透露更多的细节。他说，实质性的材料目前不宜公布。
    新华社北京8月20日电  民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民柬联合政府国际委员会部长级成员、民柬国民军总司令宋成17日在民柬控制的某根据地会见了马丁·韦德塞特中将率领的联合国赴柬埔寨实地调查组全体成员。
    宋成在会见时说，联合国国际监督机构的任务应当包括监督把100万公开的和隐蔽在金边伪军和居民中的越南人撤出柬埔寨，并监督越南设在柬埔寨的各种武器储存点。
    宋成重申，民柬方面主张由联合国派遣国际监督小组和维持和平部队。他认为，只有允许未来以西哈努克亲王领导的4方临时政府代表参加监督才能进行卓有成效的监督。
    据民柬电台广播，宋成还向马丁介绍了柬埔寨抵抗力量游击队根据地的情况及越军在柬的分布情况。
