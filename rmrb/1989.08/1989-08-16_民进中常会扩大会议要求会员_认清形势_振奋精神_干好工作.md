The third enlarged meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) began in Beijing today. The meeting called on all levels of the CDL and its members to face the situation, enhance unity, boost morale, strengthen confidence, and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in their future work.

CDL Chairman Lei Jieqiong said at the meeting that since the unfortunate passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang in mid-April, a few individuals incited a student movement in Beijing, which escalated into political turmoil and eventually a counter-revolutionary riot. Due to the leadership of the CPC, headed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other senior revolutionaries, decisive measures were taken to suppress the riot, achieving a decisive victory.

Lei Jieqiong said that over the past two months, the CDL, from the central to local levels, has closely followed the developments. This reflected the broad membership's concern for the country and the people, and their hope for national stability and unity. As assistants to the CPC, our organizations at all levels have done a lot of work to stabilize the situation. On June 28, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said at a meeting with non-CPC personages that during this incident, members of the democratic parties, in general, considered the bigger picture and did a lot of work in difficult circumstances, playing an active role in stabilizing the situation. In connection with our CDL, it can be said that we have also undergone a serious test, maintaining the glorious tradition of standing together with the CPC through thick and thin.

Lei Jieqiong said that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee was a very important meeting. The four tasks proposed by the meeting are the common goals for the struggle of the entire nation. The CDL should, as always, adhere to the fundamental principles of the state, take the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country, further strengthen and develop unity and cooperation with the CPC, strengthen its own organizational and ideological construction, and serve the construction of the two civilizations and the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Vice Chairpersons of the CDL Central Committee Zhao Puci, Chen Shungli, Ge Zhicheng, Chu Zhuang, Ye Zhishan, Mei Xiangming, and Deng Weizhi attended today's meeting.

    认清形势　振奋精神　干好工作
    新华社北京8月16日电  民进八届中央常委会第三次扩大会议今天在北京开始举行。会议要求民进各级组织和成员认清形势，增进团结，振奋精神，增强信心，把中共十三届四中全会精神落实到今后工作中去。
    民进中央主席雷洁琼在会上说，自从4月中旬胡耀邦同志不幸逝世后，在极少数人的挑动下，北京发生了学潮，进而发展成为政治动乱以至反革命暴乱。由于中国共产党有邓小平同志为首的老一代革命家掌舵，采取了坚决果断的措施，才使暴乱得到平息，取得了决定性的胜利。
    雷洁琼说，近两个多月来，民进从中央到地方，广大会员密切关注事态的发展，反映了广大会员忧国忧民和希望国家安定团结的心情。我们各级组织，作为共产党的助手，为稳定局势，都做了很多工作。江泽民总书记6月28日在党外人士座谈会上说，在这次事件中，各民主党派成员，从总体上说是顾全大局的，在困难的情况下，做了大量的工作，对稳定局势起了积极作用。联系我们民进，可以说也是经受了一场严重的考验，保持了同中国共产党风雨同舟、患难与共的光荣传统。
    雷洁琼说，中共十三届四中全会是一次非常重要的会议，会议提出的当前要抓好四项工作，是全国人民共同的奋斗目标。民进要一如既往，坚持四项基本原则的立国之本，走好改革开放的强国之路，进一步加强与发展同中国共产党的团结合作，加强自身的组织建设和思想建设，为两个文明建设服务、为和平统一祖国大业服务。
    民进中央副主席赵朴初、陈舜礼、葛志成、楚庄、叶至善、梅向明、邓伟志，出席了今天的会议。
