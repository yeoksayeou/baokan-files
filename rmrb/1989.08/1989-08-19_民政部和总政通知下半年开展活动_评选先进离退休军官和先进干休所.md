The Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Political Department recently issued a notice stating that in the second half of the year, a nationwide campaign will be launched to select and commend advanced military retirees, advanced workers, and advanced rest homes.

Currently, civil affairs departments have accepted over 50,000 retired military personnel transferred from the military and have established more than 1,300 rest homes.

The notice points out that this selection activity should be guided by the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and the central government's instructions on doing a good job in the work of retired cadres. It should deeply carry out propaganda and education, extensively carry out learning from advanced examples, so that military retirees can better maintain their revolutionary integrity and make new contributions to the Four Modernizations. It should also enable the majority of workers to further do a good job in the placement of military retirees, promote the comprehensive construction of rest homes, and raise the service and management work to a new level. This will strengthen military-civilian unity, maintain a stable social environment, and promote the smooth progress of economic construction.
