	Zhaodong in Heilongjiang Province has focused on rectifying the wholesale market as part of its efforts to restore economic order. From the beginning of the year to now, out of the original 381 state-owned and collective wholesale enterprises (including those that also engage in retail) in the city, 71 have been retained after rectification, while the remaining 247 that did not meet the conditions have been converted to retail (128), turned into individual operations (36), or closed down (83). Out of 88 individual wholesale operators, only 3 have been retained after strict examination. The rectification work has achieved significant economic and social effects.

	Through investigations and research, the city has recognized that the root cause of chaotic market prices lies in the disorderly management of the circulation sector, particularly the wholesale industry. Since 1985, the number of wholesale businesses in the city has more than doubled. While these businesses have played a role in revitalizing the economy, management has lagged behind, leading to various problems. In addition to some wholesale operators having improper business ethics, engaging in price gouging, and infringing on consumer rights, some do not keep proper accounts, evade taxes, or engage in hoarding and speculation, disrupting the normal supply of certain commodities in the market.

	According to a report in the Heilongjiang Daily: The principles guiding Zhaodong's rectification of the wholesale industry are as follows: First, crack down on illegal operations. Second, ensure that state-owned wholesale businesses play a leading role. For example, the wholesale of drugs and medicinal materials is exclusively handled by 11 state-owned specialized wholesale companies with permits, with collective and individual operations strictly prohibited. Third, clean up out-of-scope operations. For example, important production materials, state-controlled commodities, agricultural supplies, and negotiated-priced grains and oils are managed by designated departments, with specialized companies handling wholesale operations, and efforts are made to reduce cross-operations and redefine the scope of operations for some.

	After the rectification, the order in the circulation sector has significantly improved. A number of unscrupulous operators who engaged in hoarding and speculation have been shut down. Due to the widespread implementation of price tagging and the enforcement of maximum price measures, the city's overall price trend has shown signs of stabilization.

    打击非法经营　强化管理机制
    肇东整顿批发业
    本报讯　黑龙江省肇东市在整顿经济秩序工作中，从实际出发，重点整顿批发市场。从年初到现在，全市原有的381户国营和集体批发企业（含批零兼营），经过整顿保留71户，其余247户不够条件的，变零售128户，转个体36户，废业83户。88户个体批发商，经严格审查仅保留3户。整顿工作已取得重大经济和社会效果。
    这个市通过调查研究认识到，市场价格混乱，主要根源于流通领域特别是批发业管理混乱。全市自1985年后，批发业户数猛增两倍以上。它们虽对繁荣经济起到了一定作用，但因管理工作跟不上，出现了许多问题。除部分批发商经营思想不端正，哄抬物价，侵犯消费者利益外，有的不建帐、建假帐、偷税漏税，有的套购抢购，囤积居奇，扰乱一些商品的市场正常供应。
    据《黑龙江日报》报道：肇东市整顿批发业的原则，首先是打击非法经营。其次是从组织上保证国营批发商业的主渠道作用。如药品、药材的批发业务，统一交给持有许可证的11家国营专业批发公司经营，集体、个体经营权一律取消。第三是清理超范围经营。如重要生产资料、国家专控商品、农资、议价粮油等，实行归口管理，专业公司批发，尽力缩减交叉经营，有的重新核定经营范围。
    经过整顿，全市流通领域秩序明显好转。一批靠囤积居奇和中间盘剥的不法经营者被取缔。由于普遍推行了价格标签制，实行了最高限价措施，促进了全市物价回落趋势。
