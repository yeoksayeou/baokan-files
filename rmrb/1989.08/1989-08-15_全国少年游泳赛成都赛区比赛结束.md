The National Youth Swimming Competition Chengdu Division concluded after five days of intense competition on August 14 in Chengdu. Guangdong's He Jinghui set a new national youth record in the boys' 12-year-old 100-meter freestyle event, finishing with a time of 1 minute 1.51 seconds, breaking the previous record of 1 minute 1.60 seconds.

This competition, held according to regulations from the State Sports Commission, featured 112 events in both all-around and individual categories. Hunan's young athletes secured 39 championships, Guangdong won 30, Hubei took 19, while Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou won 11, 6, 5, and 2 championships respectively.

A total of 215 young athletes aged 10 to 13 from seven provincial teams, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei, and Hunan, participated in the event. The competition was divided into four age groups: 10, 11, 12, and 13 years old. To encourage the all-around development of young athletes and to cultivate talent, the State Sports Commission mandated that each participant must choose one of the four swimming styles—backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle—and compete in three different distances. Additionally, they must participate in two mixed-style events.
