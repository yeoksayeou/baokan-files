    第三届世运会闭幕
    我蹼泳选手获八枚奖牌
    新华社卡尔斯鲁厄7月30日电　（记者翁振葆）第三届世运会结束了历时10天的比赛和表演，今晚在这里的欧洲体育馆内举行了盛大的闭幕式。在欢乐的气氛中，卡尔斯鲁厄市长庄严地将世运会会旗递交给下届承办者荷兰海牙市长。我国8名选手只参加了蹼泳一项，获得2枚金牌、5枚银牌和1枚铜牌。
    在闭幕式举行的同时，欧洲体育馆外燃放了烟火。
    世运会开始于1981年，每4年举办一次。本届世运会共有21个比赛项目，两个表演项目、25个观众参与项目和众多的文化、娱乐活动，有60多个国家和地区的4000多名运动员和20万观众参与和观看了比赛和表演，规模大大超过前两届。国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇把世运会称为“乙级奥运会”。他认为，此次世运会是世运会的“真正的开端”。
    世运会发言人温克勒先生对新华社记者说，他认为本届世运会取得的主要成就有两点：提高了世运会的知名度和创造了世运会的“卡尔斯鲁厄模式”。他说，这种模式的特点是有三根支柱支撑着世运会，这就是比赛、表演和群众性的文化娱乐活动。
    世运会的最后名次计算采用奥运会的方法，意大利队以20枚金牌居首位，联邦德国队居第二位，苏联队居第三位。
