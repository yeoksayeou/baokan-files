As of August 26, 12 days after the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued the "Notice on the Requirement for Embezzlement, Bribery, and Speculative Crimes to Surrender and Confess Within a Limited Period," 1,082 criminals have surrendered to the procuratorate, turning in nearly 8 million yuan in illicit funds and a batch of stolen goods.

The Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security held a joint press conference today to introduce the above situation. It was reported that among the 1,082 surrendered criminals, the majority were embezzlement and bribery criminals. Next were the major cases, totaling 284 cases of embezzlement and bribery exceeding 10,000 yuan, and 39 officials at the county and department level or above.

After the "Notice" was issued, the masses actively reported crimes, and some criminals also actively exposed others' illegal and criminal activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30 (Reporter Zhou Lixian) The Supreme People's Court today released two cases. In one case, the criminal voluntarily surrendered and returned all the illicit funds, receiving a lighter sentence. In the other case, the criminal fled in fear and was sentenced to death, executed today.

At the press conference held today by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security, the two courts introduced the situation since the issuance of the "Notice" and reported the above two cases.

According to Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Zhu Mingshan, at the meeting, the former director of Wuhan Metallurgical Research Institute, Gui Guangqing, used his position to sell state-allocated nickel plates, illegally gaining and accepting bribes totaling 403,000 yuan. In November 1988, Gui Guangqing voluntarily surrendered to the procuratorate, truthfully confessed his crimes, and returned all the illicit funds. Gui Guangqing's crimes, according to the law, should be sentenced to death. However, considering his voluntary surrender and active return of the illicit funds, the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court, according to the Criminal Law and the "Notice" of the two courts, sentenced Gui Guangqing to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life. Gui Guangqing appealed. The Hubei Higher People's Court, after reviewing the case, believed that the first-instance judgment appropriately applied the relevant provisions of the "Notice" of the two courts and sentenced him lightly. However, considering the defendant's voluntary surrender and return of all the illicit funds, according to the spirit of the "Notice," the sentence should be even lighter. Therefore, the Hubei Higher People's Court yesterday made a final judgment on this case, changing the sentence to 15 years of imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for 3 years.

Zhu Mingshan introduced another case where the criminal was severely punished. The former chief accountant of a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China in Guiyang, Deng Anwei (female), colluded with an individual businessperson, Song Shunwen, to embezzle bank funds totaling 143,000 yuan in seven instances from November 1986 to March 1987. On March 10, 1987, fearing that their embezzlement would be exposed, the two criminals used the illicit funds to purchase a small truck and fled the country. They were extradited back to China in October 1988. On June 26, 1989, the Guiyang Intermediate People's Court sentenced Deng Anwei and Song Shunwen to death and deprivation of political rights for life for embezzlement and illegally crossing the border. Deng and Song appealed. The Guizhou Higher People's Court upheld the original judgment on July 1989 and reported it to the Supreme People's Court for review. On August 24, the Judicial Committee of the Supreme People's Court discussed and decided that the defendants Deng Anwei and Song Shunwen embezzled 140,000 yuan from the bank, a huge amount, and fled the country after the crime, making their criminal acts particularly serious and deserving severe punishment. According to the law, the death sentences for Deng Anwei and Song Shunwen were approved.

    在“两院”《通告》威慑下
    千余犯罪分子投案自首
    高法公布两案例：主动交代获轻判，畏罪潜逃被处决
    本报北京8月30日讯　记者张志业、毛磊报道：截止8月26日，最高人民法院、最高人民检察院《关于贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪分子必须在限期内自首坦白的通告》发布12天，全国有1082名犯罪分子到检察机关投案自首，交出赃款近800万元和一批赃物。
    最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、公安部今天联合召开的新闻发布会介绍了上述情况。据介绍，在投案自首的1082名案犯中，绝大多数是贪污受贿案犯。其次是大案较多，共有贪污、受贿万元以上的284件，县处级以上干部39人。
    《通告》发布以后，广大群众踊跃举报，也有相当一些犯罪分子积极检举揭发他人的违法犯罪问题。
    新华社北京8月30日电　（记者周立宪）最高人民法院今天公布了两个案例，一例案犯主动投案自首，并退回全部赃款，得到从轻判处；一例案犯畏罪潜逃，被判处死刑，今天被处决。
    最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、公安部在今天召开的新闻发布会上，介绍两院发布《通告》以来的情况，通报了上述两起案件。
    据最高人民法院副院长祝铭山在会上介绍，原武汉冶金研究所所长桂广庆利用职务之便，倒卖计划内镍板，非法获利和受贿40.3万多元。1988年11月，桂广庆自动到检察机关投案自首，如实交待罪行，并退回全部赃款。桂广庆所犯罪行，论罪应该判处死刑，但鉴于他主动投案自首，积极退赃，武汉市中级法院根据刑法和两院《通告》的规定，判处桂广庆无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身。桂广庆不服，提出上诉。湖北省高级人民法院经审理认为，一审判决对此案适用两院《通告》的有关规定，从轻判处是应当的。但根据被告人主动投案自首，并退回全部赃款的具体情况，按照《通告》精神，还应当判得轻一些。因此，湖北省高级人民法院于昨天对此案作出终审判决，改判桂广庆有期徒刑15年，剥夺政治权利3年。
    祝铭山介绍了另外一起对案犯从严惩处的案例。原中国农业银行贵阳支行某营业所主办会计邓安薇（女），勾结个体工商户宋顺文，从1986年11月至1987年3月，先后7次共贪污银行公款14.3万元。1987年3月10日，两犯唯恐贪污罪行暴露，便用赃款购买小货车一部偷越国境，潜逃国外。1988年10月被引渡回国。1989年6月26日，贵阳市中级人民法院以贪污罪和偷越国境罪判处邓安薇、宋顺文死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。邓、宋不服，提出上诉。贵州省高级人民法院于1989年7月作出二审判决，驳回上诉，维持原判，并依法报送最高人民法院复核。8月24日，最高人民法院审判委员会讨论认为，被告人邓安薇、宋顺文贪污银行公款14万元，数额巨大，且作案后畏罪潜逃国外，犯罪情节特别严重，应予严惩。依法核准了对邓安薇、宋顺文的死刑判决。
