Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd.

At 9:55 AM on August 12th, the Huangdao oil depot was struck by lightning, causing a fire and explosion. The news reached Zhongnanhai, and the leaders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council were deeply concerned. A "hotline" was immediately established between Zhongnanhai and Huangdao. General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, made three consecutive phone calls to Qingdao to inquire about the disaster situation. The day after the fire, Premier Li Peng flew to Qingdao to visit the scene of the fire. The fire at the Huangdao oil depot had been completely extinguished, and the people's hearts were filled with the deep affection between Zhongnanhai and Huangdao.

At midnight on August 12, 1989, after seeing several telegrams about the fire at the Huangdao oil depot, General Secretary Jiang Zemin called Qingdao to inquire about the situation in Huangdao.

Deputy Mayor Qin Jiahua reported the disaster situation of the Huangdao oil depot fire and explosion over the phone, saying: "The wind was blowing from the south this afternoon, and the strong wind pushed the fire towards the oil port, making the situation very dangerous. Now the wind direction has changed, which is very beneficial for disaster relief, and the oil port can be saved."

Jiang Zemin asked, "What was the cause of the fire?"

Qin Jiahua replied, "It was caused by lightning."

Jiang Zemin asked further, "Is there no lightning rod? Did the lightning rod not work?"

Qin Jiahua replied, "It is said to be a ground roll, and the lightning rod lost its effectiveness."

Jiang Zemin asked Qin Jiahua, "Who is in charge on the frontline now, and how is the organization and implementation going?"

Qin Jiahua told the General Secretary, "The municipal Party Secretary Liu Peng and Mayor Guo Songnian are both on the frontline. Vice Governor Li Chunting of Shandong Province also flew to Huangdao by helicopter to participate in the fire-fighting command."

Jiang Zemin then inquired about the rescue of the injured.

Qin Jiahua reported, "Twenty-seven people were injured, fourteen are missing, nine fire trucks, one fire command vehicle, three jeeps, and vans were burned. The military dispatched helicopters to participate in the rescue, and most of the injured have been transported to Qingdao for treatment. Water planes also participated in the fire-fighting."

Jiang Zemin asked with concern, "Do the water planes have any effect on fire-fighting?"

Qin Jiahua replied, "The fire is intense, and the water load of the planes is relatively small, so the effect is not yet clear."

Jiang Zemin, knowing that the crude oil was leaking, asked Qin Jiahua with concern, "Can the masses be mobilized to block the leaking crude oil?"

Qin Jiahua reported, "We have organized military and civilian personnel on the frontline to make every effort to intercept the leak."

Jiang Zemin asked, "What other difficulties do you have?"

Qin Jiahua said, "Secretary-General Luogan of the State Council has called, preparing to send a plane to transport some fire-extinguishing agents."

To timely understand the first-hand materials of fire-fighting and disaster relief, General Secretary Jiang Zemin noted the direct-dial phone number of the fire-fighting command headquarters on the frontline: 0532—286037.

A short while later, at 00:07 on August 13, General Secretary Jiang Zemin called the Huangdao fire-fighting command headquarters again to inquire about the latest situation.

At 11:07 AM on August 13, Deputy Mayor Yu Zhengsheng received the third phone call from General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who instructed Yu Zhengsheng to convey the greetings of the Party Central Committee to the comrades participating in the fire-fighting.

While General Secretary Jiang Zemin was making consecutive phone calls to inquire about the fire situation, Premier Li Peng decided to fly to the scene of the fire.

At 10:00 AM on August 13, Premier Li Peng, along with Secretary-General Luogan of the State Council and Minister of Energy Huang Yicheng, boarded a military plane to Qingdao. The plane circled over Huangdao for one round, and Comrade Li Peng observed the overall situation of the fire scene.

Premier Li Peng got off the plane and urgently inquired about the disaster and the fire situation. Qingdao Municipal Party Secretary Liu Peng spread out a map and reported to the Premier. Li Peng said, "From the plane, I saw that the old tank area's No. 5 and No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 oil tanks were all burning. Now we must prevent the fire from spreading and make every effort to protect the new tank area."

At 2:30 PM, Premier Li Peng, together with Shandong Provincial Party Secretary Jiang Chunyun, took a boat across the sea to Huangdao.

At the frontline command headquarters, after listening to the report by Qingdao Mayor Guo Songnian on the disaster situation and fire-fighting measures, Premier Li Peng proposed to go to the fire-fighting scene to have a look. Mayor Guo Songnian said, "The situation can also be clearly seen from the top of the command headquarters." Despite Premier Li Peng's insistence, Guo Songnian accompanied Li Peng to the scene. Premier Li Peng saw the scene of firefighters bravely fighting the fire from about 20 meters away from the fire site, and was deeply moved. He shook hands with each firefighter and said with deep emotion, "Comrades, you have worked hard!"

Returning from the fire-fighting scene, Premier Li Peng made important instructions, requiring the personnel participating in the fire-fighting to continue to fight tenaciously and ensure the safety of the oil wharf. He said that the current focus is on fire-fighting, and the next step is to summarize the experience and lessons.

Premier Li Peng cares about the oil depot and even more about the people participating in the fire-fighting. He said with deep emotion, "In this life-and-death struggle, the fire-fighters have suffered heavy casualties. They have withstood the severe test. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend my sincere greetings to the comrades who have made contributions in this struggle, express my deep condolences to the martyrs, and extend my condolences to the families of the injured and deceased. He instructed that every effort should be made to extinguish the fire, restore production as soon as possible, and carefully take care of the injured.

When Premier Li Peng returned to Beijing and heard the news that the Huangdao fire had been extinguished and production had been restored, he was very pleased. On the evening of August 18, Li Peng instructed that a phone call be made in his name to the responsible comrades of Shandong Province to express congratulations.

    中南海与黄岛
    8月12日9时55分，黄岛油库遭雷击起火爆炸。消息传到中南海，党中央、国务院领导同志极为挂心。中南海与黄岛即刻搭起一条“热线”。中共中央总书记江泽民接连三次给青岛打电话，关切地询问灾情。国务院总理李鹏在火灾的第二天，乘飞机赶赴青岛，到火灾现场。黄岛油库大火已经全部扑灭了，人们的心头记下了中南海与黄岛的深情。
    1989年8月12日接近午夜，江泽民总书记看到关于黄岛油库火灾的几份电报后，给青岛市打电话询问黄岛的情况。
    秦家浩副市长在电话里汇报了黄岛油库起火爆炸的灾情后说：“下午刮的是南风，大风将火势扑向油港，情况相当危险。现在风向转了，对救灾很有利，油港可以保住。”
    江泽民又问：“起火原因是什么？”
    秦家浩回答：“是雷击起火。”
    江泽民追问：“没有避雷针吗？避雷针不起作用吗？”秦家浩回答：“据说是地滚雷，避雷针失去了作用。”
    江泽民问秦家浩：“你们现在谁在第一线，组织落实情况怎么样？”
    秦家浩告诉总书记：“市委书记刘鹏、市长郭松年都在第一线，山东省副省长李春亭也乘直升飞机赶赴黄岛参加灭火指挥。”
    江泽民总书记又关心地询问伤员的抢救情况。
    秦家浩报告说：“伤27人，有14人失踪，烧坏9辆消防车、1辆消防指挥车、3辆吉普车和面包车。部队出动直升飞机参加救护，大部分伤员已运到青岛治疗，水上飞机也参加了灭火。”
    江泽民关切地问：“水上飞机灭火起不起作用？”
    秦家浩答：“火势大，飞机载水量比较小，明显作用还看不大出来。”
    江总书记得知原油外漏，关切地问秦家浩：“能不能发动群众堵截原油外漏？”
    秦家浩报告说：“我们已组织军民在第一线全力阻截。”
    江泽民问：“你们还有什么困难？”
    秦家浩说：“国务院秘书长罗干同志已打来电话，准备派飞机运送一些灭火剂。”
    为了及时了解灭火救灾的第一手材料，江泽民总书记记下了灭火第一线指挥部的直拨电话号码：0532—286037。
    时隔不久，13日零时7分，江泽民总书记又挂电话到黄岛灭火指挥部，询问最新情况。
    13日上午11点刚过，副市长俞正声接到江泽民总书记的第三次电话。江泽民总书记要求俞正声向参加灭火的同志们转达党中央的问候。
    在江泽民总书记接连打电话询问火情的同时，国务院总理李鹏决定飞赴火灾现场。
    13日上午10时，李鹏总理与国务院秘书长罗干、能源部部长黄毅诚乘一架军用飞机飞往青岛。飞机在黄岛上空盘旋一周，李鹏同志察看了火灾现场全貌。
    李鹏总理走下飞机，急切地询问灾情、火势。青岛市委书记刘鹏摊开地图，向总理作了汇报。李鹏同志说：“在飞机上看到老油罐区的五号和一、二、三、四号油罐都燃烧了。现在要防止火势蔓延，全力保住新罐区。”
    下午两点半，李鹏总理与山东省委书记姜春云一起乘船过海，到了黄岛。
    在前线指挥部，李鹏总理听取了青岛市市长郭松年关于灾情和灭火措施的汇报后，提出到灭火现场去看一看。郭松年市长说：“在指挥部的楼上也能看清楚。”在李鹏总理执意要求下，郭松年陪李鹏总理乘车驶往现场。李鹏总理在离火场20多米处看到消防人员奋力灭火的场面，十分激动。他与消防队员一一握手，深情地说：“同志们辛苦了！”
    从救火现场归来，李鹏总理又作了重要指示，要求参加灭火的人员继续顽强战斗，确保油码头的安全。他说，现在的中心是救火，下一步要总结经验教训。
    李鹏总理关心油库，更加关心参加灭火的人。他语重心长地说：“在这场生死搏斗中，灭火人员遭受重大伤亡，他们经受住了严峻的考验。我代表党中央、国务院向在这场斗争中做出贡献的同志表示亲切的慰问，向牺牲的同志表示沉痛的哀悼，向伤亡同志的家属表示慰问。”他指示，要尽全力把火扑灭，及早组织恢复生产，要精心护理伤员。
    当李鹏总理回到北京，听到黄岛火灾已经扑灭、生产已经恢复的消息时，十分高兴。18日晚，李鹏让以他的名义给山东省负责同志打电话表示祝贺。      新华社记者　杨凤山　张荣大
