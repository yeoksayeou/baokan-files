During a visit to Huinan County in Jilin Province, a reporter discovered that the first floor of the county's New China Bookstore had been cleared of books, which were replaced by jeans, dresses, and various other fashion items. A small number of books were relegated to a corner on the second floor. Similarly, the first floor of the New China Bookstore on Dama Road in Changchun had also been cleared of books, making way for a savings bank, photography equipment, and decorative materials.

It is understood that this phenomenon of bookstores turning into shopping malls is occurring in many places across the country. The manager of the New China Bookstore on Dama Road in Changchun recounted his "bitter experiences" to the reporter. He said that since the implementation of multi-channel book distribution, the New China Bookstore has faced significant challenges, with sales plummeting and inventory increasing. Currently, this bookstore incurs an annual loss of 35,000 yuan from book sales alone, making it difficult to pay the salaries of its 40-plus employees. As a result, the bookstore had no choice but to rent out the first floor for an annual rent of 70,000 yuan.

The New China Bookstore faces numerous difficulties. In the past, various enterprises, institutions, and university libraries placed many book orders with the New China Bookstore. Now, they can obtain books from other sources, and with the increase in book prices and the reduction in institutional budgets, the quantity of books purchased has correspondingly decreased. Like other enterprises, the New China Bookstore not only has to pay sales taxes but also rent, water and electricity bills, education fees, urban construction fees, energy taxes, and more. The original 25% gross profit from sales has been reduced to 6-7%, and in some cases, the bookstore is operating at a loss. Some bookstores have accumulated inventory, and banks are reluctant to provide loans, making it difficult to turn over books and publications. As a result, bookstores are forced to sell accumulated books at a discount, leading to a "vicious cycle" in operations.

How can bookstores turn into shopping malls? This phenomenon, which has become commonplace, cannot continue. The New China Bookstore, as the main channel for book sales, should proactively occupy the cultural market. It is also hoped that the relevant higher authorities will introduce policies to provide active support.

### 书店为何变商场

    书店为何变商场
    记者在吉林省辉南县采访，发现这个县新华书店一楼的图书已“不翼而飞”，取代这些精神食粮的是牛仔裤、连衣裙等各式时装，有少量图书被挤在二楼的一角出售。无独有偶，长春市大马路新华书店一楼的图书也都“请”出了柜台，而被储蓄所、照相器材和装饰材料所占领。
    据了解，全国许多地方都出现了书店变商场的现象。长春市大马路新华书店负责人向记者叹起了“苦经”。他说，自从图书多渠道发行以来，新华书店受到很大冲击，销书量锐减，库存增加。现在这家书店每年经营图书亏损3.5万元，连40多名职工的工资都难以发出。无奈，书店只好以每年7万元的租金把一楼租了出去。
    据了解，新华书店经营困难，原因很多。过去各企事业单位和大学图书馆向新华书店订书较多，现在他们可以从其它渠道进书，加之书价上涨，单位经费压缩，购书量相应减少。和其他企业一样，新华书店除了要交销售税外，还要交纳房租、水电费、教育费、城建费、能源税等等，原本占销售收入25％的毛利只剩下6％—7％，甚至亏损。有的书店库存积压，银行不肯贷款，书刊无法周转，只好将积压图书降价出售，于是，书店经营出现了“恶性循环”。
    书店怎能变商场？这种见怪不怪的现象不能再继续下去了。新华书店作为图书销售的主渠道，应当主动去占领文化市场。也希望主管的上级领导部门拿出政策来，给以积极的扶持。
