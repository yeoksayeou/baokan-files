The TV series "Aili and Heke" does not possess the grandeur of an epic, but it radiates a lofty poetic spirit that purifies the soul.

Strictly speaking, it is not a dramatic narrative (the plot is rather loose), but rather an ode to the selfless and fearless souls of noble individuals.

When the camera slowly and powerfully pans over the undulating peaks of the Qilian Mountains, the vast and desolate deserts and grasslands serve as a backdrop to the brilliant historical footprints left by the great internationalist warriors Louis Aili and his young British friend George Heke. The six-episode TV series "Aili and Heke," co-produced by the Gansu Provincial Drama Troupe and Gansu Television, does not follow trends or cater to popular tastes. Instead, it delves deeply into history, elevating the artistic image to a level of simple yet intense noble beauty. Compared to the current state of serious art, which has fallen into a difficult "low valley," the pursuit of such a creative aesthetic realm is, in my view, truly rare and precious.

The two protagonists portrayed in the series are not as well-known as Norman Bethune, nor have they achieved great feats in history to gain fame. However, they have demonstrated a noble human value through their open-hearted and selfless spirit. Louis Aili was a renowned New Zealand writer and poet who arrived in China in 1927 and remained until his death in Beijing in 1987. For sixty years, he steadfastly contributed to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation and the world peace movement. George Heke was born into a British middle-class family and graduated from the prestigious Oxford University. In 1937, he came to China as a journalist and later collaborated with Aili to establish education in the northwestern countryside. He died of illness in 1945 at the age of 30 and was buried in Shandan, Gansu. This TV series does not attempt to summarize their glorious lives but rather focuses on a segment of their shared experience during the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, when they established the Peili Arts and Crafts School in Shandan. The narrative is simple yet rich in historical depth.

In the creation of biographical TV dramas, "Aili and Heke" has achieved a commendable artistic breakthrough. The visual design and narrative structure of the series seamlessly blend realism with lyricism, and Aili's sincere, solemn, and passionate monologues run throughout the entire drama. This achieves both a concise narrative and expands the work's profound thought content and visual tension. For example, in the prologue, the series uses documentary footage of a "funeral," showing Aili's relatives scattering his ashes in the Shandan Siba Beach, where he had led the Peili students to cultivate the land. The voiceover is his reflective monologue: "One of the gifts China has given me is to make a person's life a little meaningful to humanity." This heartfelt language resonates through the vast sky and earth, revealing the inner richness and strength of a noble and pure person. Perhaps this is also the central theme of the entire series. Louis Aili once wrote in his autobiography: "Although I knew little when I came from New Zealand, I gradually came to appreciate the greatness of Chinese civilization and its potential. China is a crucible that forges a new type of person through countless trials and tribulations," and he also said, "I have a close connection with the advancing China, and I will always be deeply gratified to participate in its great cause of struggle." The inspiration and creative passion of the directors and writers of "Aili and Heke" are derived from their comprehensive observation of Louis Aili's life, which was closely intertwined with the struggle of the Chinese people. Aili's establishment of the school in Shandan, facing the impoverished children and youth of the northwestern countryside, explored a creative educational form of half-work and half-study, forging new people through labor. This process was imbued with both lofty love and a vibrant historical creative spirit.

Many touching scenes and details in the drama revolve around the artistic theme of "forging new people." For instance, Aili's rescue of the young girl Yanzhu, who was sold to a small inn, helping her escape the cage and enter school, reveals Aili's humanitarian love for the poor and helpless children. In dealing with the student Li Amo, who was tempted by evil to steal and sell equipment, Aili both criticized him sternly and gave him sincere guidance. After removing the corrupt Chen Manager, he appointed Amo to take over the financial management, encouraging him to correct his mistakes through action. These scenes, highlighted with thick ink, vividly depict Aili's open-hearted and broad-minded approach to forging new people, leaving a strong impression on the audience and providing profound thoughts.

The portrayal of the young "Principal Heke" (Heke) is concise yet deeply moving. As a young man who had just graduated from "Oxford" with a bright future, he willingly abandoned the comfortable material life in the West and came to the impoverished western wilderness of China, covering himself with a worn quilt and caring for two orphans of martyrs. He devoted his youth to the cause of the Peili School. This life choice itself has immense spiritual appeal.

Yes, international friends like Aili and Heke, who dedicated themselves to the Chinese revolutionary cause and even sacrificed their lives, and those who made their lives shine brilliantly in the struggle, are worthy of praise and song. Nobility here not only signifies a spirit of selflessness and the greatness of life but also embodies an aesthetic realm that purifies the heart. Such an aesthetic realm is precisely what we should advocate in today's artistic creation.

The success of this TV series is also inseparable from the artistic creation of the two leading actors. Aili's nephew, David Somerset, and Heke's nephew, Mark Toss, respectively played Aili and Heke. Although they are not professional actors, they successfully and vividly recreated the spiritual demeanor of Aili and Heke in their youth, with a deep admiration and understanding of their parents' noble character and inner qualities. This deserves our sincere gratitude. Although the visual design of "Aili and Heke" is unique and elegant, the pacing is too slow, the plot is somewhat diluted, and certain historical backgrounds are not clearly explained. This undoubtedly creates some obstacles for the audience's viewing and reception (especially for television as a "family screen"). This flaw should be noted by the creators.

    献给崇高灵魂的歌吟
    ——观电视剧《艾黎与何克》感言
    黄式宪
    诚然，它并不具有史诗的恢弘气度，但却焕发出一种荡涤心灵的崇高诗情。
    严格说，它也不是剧（情节趋于散淡），而是献给无私无畏的灵魂崇高者的歌吟。
    当镜头沉缓有力地从祁连山起伏的峰峦摇过，那莽莽苍苍的戈壁、草坡，俨然烘托起伟大的国际主义战士路易·艾黎和他年轻的英国朋友乔治·何克当年在这里留下的闪光的历史足迹。由甘肃省话剧团和甘肃电视台联合摄制的六集电视剧《艾黎与何克》（姚运焕编剧，谢小晶导演），不趋时，不媚俗，独向历史的深层开掘，使艺术形象升腾出一种质朴而灼热的崇高美。相对于目前严肃艺术跌入“低谷”的艰窘状态而言，能这样执著地追求创作的美学境界，在我看来确属难能可贵。
    剧中所塑造的这两位主人公，并不像白求恩那样广为人知，也不曾在历史上建树丰功伟绩而声名显赫，但他们却以襟怀坦荡、无私奉献的精神而显示了一种崇高的人生价值。路易·艾黎是新西兰著名作家和诗人，1927年踏上中国土地，直到1987年逝世于北京，六十年如一日，始终坚定地为中国人民的解放事业和世界和平运动贡献力量；乔治·何克出生在英国中产阶级家庭，毕业于著名的牛津大学，1937年以记者身份来到中国，后来协同艾黎到西北农村兴办教育，1945年不幸病卒，葬于甘肃山丹，年仅30岁。这部电视剧并不企图概括他们光辉的一生，而只是撷取了抗日战争艰苦年代他们共同在山丹创办培黎工艺学校这段经历，朴素而富于历史厚重感地展开了艺术叙事。
    在传记体裁的电视剧创作里，《艾》剧的编导取得了令人欣喜的艺术开拓。它的画面造型和叙事构架，将纪实性与抒情性密切交融，并以艾黎真挚、凝重而富于激情的独白贯穿全剧，一是达成了叙事的凝炼，二是拓展了作品深沉的思想容量和画面的张力。如序幕，借用纪录片“葬礼”的镜头，表现艾黎的亲属遵照他的遗嘱将骨灰撒在当年他亲自带领培黎师生开荒的山丹四坝滩上，画外是他沉思的独白：“中国赠予我的礼物之一是使一个人的生命对人类有点儿意义。”这深情的语言，回荡在漠漠天地之间，透现着一个高尚的人、一个纯粹的人内心的充实和力量。或许，这也正是统贯全剧的题旨之所在。路易·艾黎曾在自传中这样写道：“尽管我从新西兰来时知之甚少，但我逐渐对中国文明的伟大和它将会发挥的潜力有了认识。中国是通过千难万险的考验来铸造一种新型的人的熔炉”，又说，“我同前进中的中国有密切的联系，对于能参与它的伟大事业的斗争我永远感到莫大的欣慰。”《艾》剧编导的灵感和创作激情，正是从对路易·艾黎与中国人民斗争事业血肉相连的生命价值的总体观照中提取的，艾黎在山丹办学，面对的是西北农村的穷苦娃娃和青年，探索着一种半工半读、在劳动中锻铸新人的创造性教育形式，这其间高扬着的既是崇高的爱，也是一种生气勃勃的历史创造精神。
    剧中许多感人肺腑的场面和细节，无不是环绕着“锻铸新人”这一艺术命题而呈现的。如艾黎救助被卖到小客店里的小姑娘燕子，帮她挣脱牢笼而进校读书，淡淡几笔，揭示了艾黎对贫苦无告的孩子所寄予的人道主义的爱心；在对待管库房的学生李阿毛被坏人诱惑而犯了盗卖器材的错误上，他既作了严厉批评，又给予谆谆教诲，在将拖阿毛下水的陈主任撤职后，又命阿毛接替他主管财务，鼓励他以行动改正错误，这几场被浓墨予以渲染的戏，绘形传神地刻画了艾黎在锻铸新人上既严厉又宽厚的坦荡胸襟，带给人以强烈的心灵震撼和思想启迪。
    对年轻的“何校长”（何克）的刻画，笔触不多，却感人至深。作为一个刚从“牛津”毕业、前程无量的英国青年，却甘愿抛弃西方优裕的物质生活，只身来到中国贫困的西部荒原，盖着一条破棉被，身边还抚养着两个烈士的遗孤，把一腔热血献给了培黎的办学事业，这一人生的抉择，本身就具有巨大的精神感召力。
    是的，像艾黎与何克这样为中国革命事业尽力甚至奉献了生命的国际朋友，像他们那样在战斗中使生命焕发出绚丽光辉的崇高的人，是值得礼赞和歌吟的。崇高在这里不仅意味着一种奉献精神和生命之伟力，更体现为一种荡涤人心的审美的境界。这样一种审美的境界，恰恰正是我们今天艺术创作中应予以张扬的。
    这部电视剧的成功，还与两位主角扮演者的艺术创造分不开。由艾黎的外甥大卫·萨默塞特，何克的外甥马克·托斯，分别饰演艾黎与何克，他们都不是专业演员，但怀着对父辈崇高品格、内在气质的景仰和深刻理解，成功地、形神毕肖地再现了艾黎与何克当年的精神风貌。这是应当向他们致以深切谢意的。尽管《艾》剧的画面造型构思独特、别致，但节奏过于迟缓，情节趋于淡化，某些历史背景交待不够清晰，这对观众的观赏和接受显然造成若干障碍（特别是电视作为可选择的“家庭屏幕”）造成美玉之瑕，似应引起创作者注意的。
