Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, July 31st.

The Arab League's Three-Party Committee for the resolution of the Lebanese crisis released a statement today in Algiers. The statement noted that the committee's mediation efforts in the areas of security and politics have reached a stalemate. The committee will submit a comprehensive and detailed report to the leaders of Arab countries to re-examine the steps that can be taken to help Lebanon out of its predicament.

Despite the Three-Party Committee's efforts to engage with Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries, and to implement the resolutions of the Casablanca Arab Summit and its action plan, the committee has not been successful in achieving its stated goals.

The Three-Party Committee expressed concern and indignation over the recent deterioration of the situation in Lebanon. Reports indicate that on July 29th, residents of Beirut continued to flee, and nightly shelling between the eastern and western parts of the city persisted. Since the resumption of the civil war on March 8th, at least 552 people have been killed and 2,407 injured across the city.

    阿盟三方委员会认为
    调解黎危机陷入僵局
    新华社阿尔及尔7月31日电　阿拉伯解决黎巴嫩危机3方委员会今天在这里发表的一项公报中认为，该委员会在安全和政治方面的调解使命已陷于僵局，委员会将向阿拉伯国家领导人提交一份全面和详尽的报告，以便重新研究可以采取的步骤以帮助黎巴嫩摆脱困境。
    尽管3方委员会同黎巴嫩、叙利亚、伊拉克以及其他国家进行了接触，为实施卡萨布兰卡阿拉伯首脑会议的决议和实施其行动计划作出了相应的努力，但是3方委员会未能成功地实现其既定目标。
    3方委员会在公报中对黎巴嫩近日局势恶化表示忧虑和义愤。据报道，7月29日贝鲁特居民继续外逃，贝鲁特东西区夜间的炮战仍在继续。从3月8日内战重开以来，全市至少已有552人死亡、2407人受伤。
