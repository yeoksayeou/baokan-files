The sequel to "Governance Requires Integrity," edited by the Research Office of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, is soon to be published by the People's Daily Press.

Early this year, the People's Daily Press published the book "Governance Requires Integrity," which was well-received by readers and praised by relevant departments. The 100,000 copies quickly sold out. To support the construction of a clean government, the Research Office of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has compiled the sequel, "Governance Requires Integrity." This book mainly collects materials related to integrity and anti-corruption from the second half of last year to the period before and after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. It includes relevant regulations from the Party Central Committee and the State Council, speeches by central leaders, newspaper commentaries, articles, and typical cases. The book has a total of 200,000 words.
