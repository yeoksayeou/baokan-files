The fishpond contractor, Xia Jinchen, from Zhanan Village, Wulie Township, Dongtai City, incurred a loss of over 8,000 yuan from 1984 to 1986 due to some connections coming to fish in the pond. Later, Xia decided not to allow anyone to fish in his contracted fishpond.

On August 10 of last year, six people from the Dongtai City Personnel Bureau came to Zhanan Village, Wulie Township, to fish. Xia Jinchen disagreed. The director of the village plastic factory, Xia XX, intervened and agreed to have the plastic factory pay 50 yuan per hour for each fishing rod. These six people fished for an hour each, and the plastic factory paid 300 yuan for the fishing fee. That noon, the plastic factory also treated them to a meal, costing 278 yuan. After eating their fill, these people took home over 30 kilograms of fish they had caught, for their wives, children, and elderly to enjoy.

    连吃带拿的钓鱼人
    东台市五烈乡扎南村鱼塘承包人夏尽臣1984年至1986年，因一些关系户来塘钓鱼等原因而亏损8000余元。后来，夏就下了决心不准任何人在自己的承包鱼塘里钓鱼。
    去年8月10日，东台市人事局的6个人来五烈乡扎南村钓鱼，夏尽臣不同意。村塑料厂厂长夏××就出面做工作，并答应由塑料厂出钱，每把钩钓每小时付款50元。这6个人各钓了一个小时，塑料厂为他们付了300元的钓鱼费。这天中午，塑料厂又招待他们吃了一餐，花费278元。这些人在吃饱喝足之后，还将自己钓的三十多公斤鱼拿回家去，供妻儿老小享受。
