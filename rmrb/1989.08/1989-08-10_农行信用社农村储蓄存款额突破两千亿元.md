	The People's Daily, Beijing, August 10th — By reporter Jiang Xia: By the end of July, the rural savings deposits of the Agricultural Bank of China and the Rural Credit Cooperatives have surpassed the 200 billion yuan mark, reaching 202.456 billion yuan. This is an increase of 28.852 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, exceeding the annual savings deposit plan. The rapid growth of savings deposits has, to a certain extent, eased the contradiction between the supply and demand of rural funds.
