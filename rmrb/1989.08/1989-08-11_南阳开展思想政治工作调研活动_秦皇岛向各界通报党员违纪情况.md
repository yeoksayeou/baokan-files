Nanyang Launches Research on Ideological and Political Work

How can ideological and political work in the new era be effectively implemented? The Nanyang region of Henan Province has launched a large-scale investigation and research effort to gather firsthand materials, ensuring that ideological and political work is targeted and effective.

Since late April this year, the Nanyang Regional Committee has initiated a research activity that first focused on 1,330 state-owned, collective, and "three-resource" enterprises across the region. After a short period of training, 683 cadres were dispatched to various enterprises. They focused on long-standing issues such as the role and leadership structure of ideological and political work in enterprises, the construction of organizational teams, and educational content. They formulated 42 specific investigation topics, concentrating their efforts on both advanced and lagging enterprises. They also used the investigation process to encourage reflection among workers and cadres and to promote mutual learning among enterprises. So far, various regions have written 13 comprehensive investigation reports, summarized 48 typical experiences with different characteristics, and proposed 158 suggestions.

Based on careful analysis and research, the Nanyang Regional Committee has come up with a set of concrete measures to strengthen ideological and political work in enterprises. These measures include establishing a strict system and standards to enhance the role of enterprise party organizations in ideological and political work; improving the quality and treatment of enterprise political workers to strengthen the team of full-time political workers; and formulating a systematic plan to strengthen political education for enterprise cadres and workers, focusing on the Four Cardinal Principles, to build a team of "four-haves" workers.

Qinhuangdao Reports Party Members' Disciplinary Violations

The city of Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province began this year to report cases of party members' disciplinary violations to various democratic parties and sectors of society. By openly disclosing "internal problems," the city is actively seeking supervision, increasing transparency in anti-corruption efforts, and promoting clean governance across the city.

Qinhuangdao does not cover up or merely go through the motions of reporting these issues. Before reporting, they prepare thoroughly, writing accurate and responsible reports, and inviting representatives from various democratic parties to attend. During the meetings, they use both written materials and face-to-face dialogues to solicit opinions and demands from attendees regarding clean governance. After the meetings, they follow up with visits. In terms of content, they both introduce the overall situation of party members' disciplinary violations and highlight typical cases.

To make this practice institutionalized and regular, Qinhuangdao has adopted various forms of reporting based on different levels, holding more than 30 meetings to report on the handling of disciplinary violations, solicit opinions on clean governance, and promote democratic supervision. A responsible person from the China Agricultural and Industrial Party in the city said that the ruling party accepting supervision from democratic parties and using the form of reporting party members' disciplinary violations is a wise move. Responsible persons from the China Democratic National Construction Association and the China Democratic League expressed their support and willingness to assist the disciplinary inspection departments in their work.

    南阳开展思想政治工作调研活动  秦皇岛向各界通报党员违纪情况
    本报郑州电  记者李而亮报道：怎样才能把新时期思想政治工作抓到实处？河南南阳地区通过开展大规模的调查研究，以扎扎实实的第一手材料，保证新时期思想政治工作对症下药、抓出成效。
    南阳地委从今年4月下旬开始的调研活动，首先在全区1330个全民、集体和“三资”企业中展开。683名干部经过短期培训后，分赴各个企业。他们紧紧围绕企业思想政治工作在地位作用、领导体制、机构队伍建设、教育内容等长期困惑不解的难点，列出42个专项调查题目，集中主要力量对先进与落后两类企业进行重点调查，并结合当前形势和社会现象，把调查研究的过程变成职工干部反思和各企业间取长补短的过程。到目前为止，各地区共撰写出综合性调查报告13份，总结出不同特点的典型经验48份，提出各种建议158条。
    在通过认真分析研究的基础上，南阳地委拿出了一套硬措施，为加强企业的思想政治工作办好几件实事，其中包括制定一套严密的制度和规范，提高企业党组织的地位，保证其在思想政治工作中发挥核心作用；从提高企业政工干部素质、解决其待遇入手，充实专职政工干部队伍；制定系统的规划，对企业干部职工强化以四项基本原则为内容的政治教育，建设“四有”职工队伍等。
    本报石家庄电  记者陈国琦报道：河北省秦皇岛市今年开始向各民主党派及社会各界通报党员违纪情况，主动张扬“家丑”，自觉接受监督，增加了反腐败的透明度，促进了全市廉政建设。
    这个市扬“家丑”，不搪塞遮掩，不流于形式。通报情况前，作好充分的准备，准确负责地写出文字材料，登门邀请各民主党派到会，讲明通报的内容；会上采用书面材料与当面对话两种形式，征求与会者对廉政建设的意见和要求；会后跟踪走访。在通报内容上，他们既注意介绍党员违纪的全面情况，又坚持突出重点，披露典型案例。
    为使这种作法制度化、经常化，秦皇岛市通报情况根据不同层次采用了多种形式，共召开处理违纪党员通报会、廉政建设意见征求会、民主监督会等30余次。市农工党一位负责人说，执政党接受民主党派监督，采用通报党员违纪情况这种形式，是明智之举。市民建、民进负责人表示，要关心和支持纪检部门的工作。
