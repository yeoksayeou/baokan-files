Canada's developed fisheries are world-renowned, and anyone who has visited Canada has a deep impression of this. During the summer, in many inland rivers and lakes, fishing does not require bait. Even someone with no fishing experience can catch hundreds of pounds of fish in a day.

However, in this country rich with fish, fishing and catching fish are not "free." In provinces including Newfoundland, every angler must purchase a permit. When buying the permit, one receives a small booklet about fishing rules. Anglers must carefully study these rules; otherwise, if they violate the law, they will face fines, have their fishing gear confiscated, or even face legal trouble, leading to many problems.

The fishing rules inform people about the times and areas where certain fish species can be fished each year to protect their reproduction. For some species, regulations specify the size at which they can be fished; if caught below the specified size, they must be released immediately. Fishery protection officials have the right to check permits and search vehicles and homes suspected of hiding fish. Canadians are generally law-abiding, and even when no one is watching, they do not engage in illegal activities.

In Newfoundland, the focus of fishery resource protection is the management of the fishing industry, with the core being the permit and quota system. From large fishing companies to over 20,000 individual fishermen, all must have permits and quotas to go out to sea and fish.

The manager of the largest fishing company in St. John's, the Fishery Products International Company, told the reporter that their most important annual task is to determine the quotas. The quota targets are issued by the provincial government and then allocated through discussions among industry peers.

Each year, the quotas for various fish species are different, determined by the research results of several fisheries research institutes. In St. John's, the reporter visited the North Atlantic Fisheries Research Center, which is under the federal government's Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

It was introduced that the federal government allocates substantial funds each year to support the center's research work. Last year, to investigate the number of seals, several helicopters were dispatched for aerial surveys, costing several million Canadian dollars. This is because seals eat fish, and their numbers directly affect the fish population.

Additionally, a patrol and monitoring team composed of ships and aircraft ensures that quotas are not exceeded, and if necessary, they can also receive assistance from the navy.

Canada also actively participates in the management of fishery resources outside the 200-nautical-mile economic zone to prevent overfishing that could harm the ecosystem.

Canada also values scientific research and the development of aquaculture. In St. John's, the reporter also visited a large marine aquaculture experimental laboratory. Its main task is to study the breeding and accelerated growth of certain fish species to promote the development of artificial aquaculture. Since its establishment in 1967, the laboratory has achieved leading-edge results in many fields.

Around Newfoundland Island is the world-famous Grand Banks, making Canada one of the world's major fish product exporters.

Admirably, Canadians have not overfished or overharvested just because they have a naturally rich fishing ground; instead, they have prioritized resource protection.

### 加拿大重视保护渔业资源

    加拿大重视保护渔业资源
    本报记者　郭文福
    加拿大渔业发达是世界闻名的，到过加拿大的人都对此有较深的印象。到了夏季，在许多内河湖泊钓鱼是不需鱼饵的。即使毫无垂钓经验的人，一天钓个百把斤鱼也不稀奇。
    可是，在这个多鱼的国家里，钓鱼和捕鱼却很不“自由”。在包括纽芬兰在内的各个省，每个钓鱼者都得购买许可证，在买许可证时，可得到一本有关钓鱼规则的小册子。对规则，垂钓者必须细细研读，否则违了法，就会遭罚款或被没收渔具，甚至吃官司，麻烦就多了。
    钓鱼规则告诉人们，为保护某些鱼种的繁殖，每年何时、在何区域可以钓何种鱼类。对有的鱼种，还规定长到什么尺寸才可以钓，小于规定尺寸的，钓到后必须立即放生。鱼类保护官员有权检查证件，搜查有嫌违法者的车辆甚至家中藏鱼的地方。加拿大人大多是自觉遵纪守法的，即使在无人知晓的情况下，也不做违法的事。
    在纽芬兰岛，渔业资源保护的重点是对捕鱼业的管理，核心是许可证和配额制度，上至渔业公司，下到2万多个体捕鱼户，都必须有许可证和配额才能出海捕鱼。
    圣约翰斯最大的渔业公司——鱼产品国际公司负责人告诉记者，他们每年最重要的任务就是制定配额。配额指标由省政府下达，然后在渔业同行的会议上协商分配。
    每年各种鱼类的配额都不相同，政府是依据几家鱼类资源研究所每年的研究成果来确定的。在圣约翰斯，记者参观了隶属联邦政府海洋渔业部的北大西洋渔业资源中心。
    据介绍，联邦政府每年都拨巨款支持中心的研究工作。去年，为了调查海豹的数量，曾出动几架直升机进行航测，花掉几百万加元。因为海豹是食鱼的，其数量多少直接影响着鱼的数量。
    此外，一支由舰艇和飞机组成的巡逻监视队伍负责确保配额不被突破，必要时还可得到海军的协助。
    加拿大对200海里经济区以外的渔场资源，也积极参与管理，防止出现有损生态的过量捕捞。
    加拿大还重视科研，发展养殖业。在圣约翰斯，记者还参观了一所大型的海生物养殖试验室。它的主要任务是研究某些鱼种的繁殖和加快生长，以促进人工养殖业的发展。试验室自1967年创办以来，在许多领域取得了领先世界的成就。
    纽芬兰岛周围是世界著名的大渔场，它使加拿大成为世界上最主要的鱼产品出口国。
    令人钦佩的是，加拿大人并没有因为有了得天独厚的大渔场就滥捕多捞，而是把保护资源放到了第一位。
