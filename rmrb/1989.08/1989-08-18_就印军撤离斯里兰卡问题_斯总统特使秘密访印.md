To accelerate the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan President's special envoy, Bradman Weerakoon, held three days of secret talks with Indian government officials here.

An Indian government spokesperson said that Weerakoon met with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi today before returning to Sri Lanka. The spokesperson did not disclose the specifics of the talks, only stating that the purpose of the talks was to further discuss the proposals made during the recent bilateral talks.

The spokesperson said that Weerakoon will report the results of the talks to President Premadasa and that a statement will be issued soon.

From July 29th to August 4th, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lalith Athulathmudali held talks with Indian government officials in New Delhi. During the talks, India proposed to withdraw its 45,000 troops in Sri Lanka at a rate of 1,500 troops per week. According to this proposal, India will not have completely withdrawn its troops by next February. However, the Sri Lankan side hopes that India will complete its withdrawal by mid-September of this year.

An official source said today that the Sri Lankan President's special envoy will visit India again in the near future, bringing new proposals from President Premadasa.

    就印军撤离斯里兰卡问题
    斯总统特使秘密访印
    新华社新德里8月17日电　为加速印度从斯里兰卡的撤军进程，斯里兰卡总统特使布拉德曼·维拉孔与印度政府官员在这里举行了3天秘密会谈。
    印度政府发言人说，维拉孔今天拜会了印度总理拉·甘地后返回了斯里兰卡。发言人未透露会谈的具体内容，只是说会谈的目的是进一步讨论不久前两国会谈中提出的建议。
    发言人说，维拉孔将向普雷马达萨总统汇报会谈结果，并且很快会发表一项公报。
    7月29日至8月4日，斯里兰卡外长兰扬·维杰拉特内与印度政府官员在新德里举行了会谈。会谈中，印度提议它将以每星期撤军1500名的速度撤回其驻斯4.5万名军人。按照这一建议，在明年2月前，印度不会全部撤回军队。而斯里兰卡方面则希望印度于今年9月中旬前全部撤军。
    此间官方人士今天说，斯里兰卡总统特使将在近日内再度访问印度，并带来普雷马达萨总统的新建议。
