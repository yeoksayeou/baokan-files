Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 14th. Reporter Pan Gang reports: Minister of Commerce Hu Ping and Vice Minister Zhang Shiyao emphasized at the "Double Increase, Double Conservation" telephone conference of the commercial system this evening: The focus of market arrangements for the next few months is to strive to maintain the stable development momentum of the first seven months and to do everything possible to ensure a smooth National Day market.

Hu Ping pointed out that there are many favorable factors for the market in the latter half of this year, but we must also see the difficulties. For example, the remaining purchasing power continues to increase, putting more pressure on the market; commercial inventory is insufficient, and regulatory measures are weak; controlling price increases remains difficult, especially with tight credit funds, which will affect both production and procurement. Additionally, a significant trade deficit will also impact the import of raw materials and goods. Therefore, in the next few months, we must first expand procurement and reduce demand; second, ensure the supply of major commodities such as grain, oil, and cotton; third, continue to stabilize the market for subsidiary foodstuffs; fourth, further arrange the supply of daily industrial goods.

Zhang Shiyao emphasized that the "Double Increase, Double Conservation" campaign in the commercial sector must focus on supporting production, stabilizing the market, expanding sales, improving services, and increasing efficiency. Currently, we need to focus on the procurement of important commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, as well as various marketable goods. The specific goals for the commercial system's "Double Increase, Double Conservation" campaign this year are: the commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives' commodity sales should increase by more than 10% compared to last year, the profits of state-owned commerce should increase by about 10%, all enterprises in the system that are operating at a loss should turn a profit by 25%, and the purchasing power of social groups should be reduced by 20%. The level of commodity circulation costs in the second half of the year should be lower than in the first half.

    商业系统“双增双节”电话会议提出
    继续保持市场稳定
    本报北京8月14日讯　记者潘岗报道：商业部部长胡平、副部长张世尧今晚在商业系统“双增双节”电话会议上提出：今后几个月市场安排的重点是争取保持前7个月平稳发展的好势头，千方百计安排好国庆市场。
    胡平指出，今年后几个月市场有利因素不少，但必须看到困难的一面，如结余购买力继续增加，对市场的压力越来越大；商品库存不足，调控手段薄弱；控制物价上涨的难度仍很大，特别是信贷资金紧张，对生产、收购都将产生影响。此外，外贸逆差较大，也会影响原材料和商品进口。因此，今后几个月一要扩大收购，压缩需求；二要搞好粮、油、棉等重大商品的供应；三要继续稳定副食品市场；四要进一步安排好日用工业品供应。
    张世尧强调，商业部门的“双增双节”运动，必须以支持生产、稳定市场、扩大购销、改进服务、提高效益为重点。当前要抓好关系国计民生的重要商品和各种适销商品的收购。商业系统今年“双增双节”的具体目标是：商业、供销社的商品销售比去年增长10％以上，国营商业的利润增长10％左右，系统所有企业，凡属经营性亏损都要扭亏25％，社会集团购买力支出压缩20％。下半年的商品流通费用水平要做到低于上半年。
