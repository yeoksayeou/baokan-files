No Rats, No Flies: Chifeng Deserves the Title of Cleanest City in China

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hohhot, August 3rd, (reporters Huang Zhenggen, correspondent Liang Xiulin) The new city of Chifeng in the Inner Mongolian desert has been vigorously promoting socialist spiritual civilization construction and carrying out a mass patriotic hygiene campaign centered on pest control and disease prevention. The entire city has achieved the status of being rat-free and fly-free, making it the cleanest city in the country.

	Since 1981, the city of Chifeng has consistently maintained the honor of the "Ajinai" (meaning "soaring steed" in Mongolian) Award for Patriotic Hygiene in the autonomous region. It has been named a "National Hygiene Advanced City" by the state and has become the first prefecture-level city in the country to achieve a rat-free status. Its infectious disease management ranks first in the national evaluation.

	Recently, reporters visited this city of 220,000 people by reputation. They saw that this place was indeed unique. The streets, alleys, courtyards, and public places were all clean and tidy, with no accumulation of sewage or exposed garbage. During the summer, fruits were fragrant, and cold drinks were on sale. Whether in bustling markets or secluded alleys, there was no littering of fruit peels or flying flies. Coupled with the lush trees and vibrant flowers in the city, it truly felt like entering a "paradise on earth."

	Currently, the health level of the people in Chifeng city has significantly improved, and the average life expectancy is increasing year by year. In 1988, the average life expectancy for men was 71.04 years, and for women, it was 74.29 years, reaching the high levels of Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. The infant mortality rate is only 1.4%, ranking among the lowest in the country.

    无老鼠出没　无苍蝇乱飞
    赤峰当称全国最干净城市
    据新华社呼和浩特8月3日电　（记者黄正根、通讯员梁秀林）内蒙古塞上新城赤峰狠抓社会主义精神文明建设，大力开展以除害灭病为中心的群众性爱国卫生运动，全城已经实现无鼠害、无苍蝇，成为全国最干净的城市。
    自1981年以来，赤峰城一直保持了自治区爱国卫生“阿吉奈”（蒙语“飞腾的骏马”）奖的荣誉；荣获国家命名的“全国卫生先进城镇”的称号；成为全国第一个无鼠害的省辖市市区；传染病管理在全国评比中名列第一。
    记者最近慕名访问了这座有22万人口的新城，看见此地确实与众不同，大街小巷，楼院胡同，公共场所，干净整洁，见不到积存的污水和暴露的垃圾；盛夏季节，瓜果飘香，冷饮上市，无论是繁华的市场还是偏僻胡同，没有人乱扔果皮和发现乱飞的苍蝇。再加上城区绿树成荫，繁花似锦，真令人有进入“世外桃源”之感。
    现在，赤峰城区人民健康水平明显提高，人均寿命逐年增加，1988年男性为71.04岁，女性74.29岁，达到津、京、沪较高地区水平。而婴儿死亡率仅为1.4％，列为全国最低水平。
