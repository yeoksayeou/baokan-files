Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th.

Members attending the ninth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress yesterday afternoon conducted group deliberations on the draft of the Urban Residents' Committee Organization Law. The members believed that it is very necessary to formulate the Residents' Committee Organization Law and suggested that it be promulgated as soon as possible. At the same time, they proposed amendments to some issues in the draft.

Yang Lieyu, a member, said that previously we had the Regulations on the Organization of Urban Residents' Committees to follow, which had a relatively good positive effect. However, after the Cultural Revolution, the work of the Residents' Committees was greatly weakened, and the composition of urban residents had changed significantly. Now it is necessary to clarify this legally, establish an organization, and make it play a better role, which is objectively welcomed by the people. It is suggested to expedite the deliberation and implementation.

Zhang Ke, a member, said that the work of urban Residents' Committees is an important part of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to do a good job in grassroots work in the city. Formulating the Organization Law provides a legal basis and guarantee for the work of Residents' Committees, and it is very necessary to strengthen the work of urban Residents' Committees.

Xu Yunbei, He Manfen, and Zhou Zhan'ao, members, believed that the Residents' Committee is the basic unit of urban society. If well-managed, it will be beneficial to implement the Party's and the state's lines, principles, and policies. The recent turmoil reflects that there are many problems in the urban grassroots. The work of the Residents' Committees needs to be greatly improved and strengthened, and the socialist direction should be adhered to. It should be clearly stated in this law how to adhere to the four cardinal principles.

Guo Lifu, a member, said that from the perspective of China's national conditions, the Residents' Committee is not only an organization for self-management, self-education, and self-service, but it should also accept the leadership of the Party and the government, and not just emphasize the aspect of self-governance.

He Yipu, a member, said that the Residents' Committee should serve as a link between the people and the people's government. The main tasks of the Residents' Committee are to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of residents; handle public affairs and public welfare for residents; and provide living services for residents. Other tasks should be in a supporting position, otherwise the tasks will be too heavy. It should be stipulated that the Residents' Committee is elected by residents' meetings or representatives' meetings.

Wang Houde, a member, said that the Residents' Committee Organization Law is an important law. It, along with the Village Committee Organization Law, is one of the two laws related to the people's self-management, self-education, and self-service. Our other laws are almost all about controlling people, while these two laws are about the people having self-governance rights. The current problem is that the grassroots government organizations are in chaos, some are almost paralyzed, and the relationship between cadres and the masses at the grassroots level is tense. The environment for implementing the law needs to be good in order to ensure its implementation.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th.

The ninth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress today conducted group discussions on the report by Ren Zhonglin, Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, entrusted by the State Council, on the rectification and cleanup of companies. The members affirmed the achievements made in the rectification and cleanup of companies in the previous period, and proposed that further efforts should be made to resolutely carry out this important policy of winning the trust of the people.

Clear understanding and resolute attitude are required for the rectification and cleanup of companies

Hu Daiguang, a member, said that various departments have done a lot of work on the rectification and cleanup of companies and have achieved some results, but it is still only preliminary and far from the expected effect. Therefore, we cannot be complacent and must make a firm decision to solve the problems of excessive and overheated companies. The understanding must be clear, and the attitude must be resolute. The masses are concerned not about the issue of fines, but about how to deal with illegal acts. Now, those who have committed embezzlement, bribery, and speculation are required to confess and surrender within the prescribed time limit, and those who actively return the ill-gotten gains will be given lenient, mitigated, or exempted punishment according to the law, otherwise they will be severely punished according to the law. The masses believe that this policy has had some effect now, but the effect is not enough. It is necessary to create a momentum and timely publicize some typical cases of severe punishment to better and more effectively achieve a thorough victory in the rectification and cleanup of companies.

Aisin Gioro Puyue, a member, believes that the complexity and seriousness of the rectification and cleanup must be recognized, otherwise it will become an incurable disease. First of all, from top to bottom, from the central to the local levels, everyone must be responsible and involved, and it is absolutely not allowed to use a one-time campaign approach, especially not to have a big noise but little rain, or to cover up, or even to be tight on top and loose at the bottom.

Ding Guangxun, a member, said that Director Ren Zhonglin's report is not satisfactory. When reporting to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, there should be more transparency, and the difficulties and interferences in the rectification and cleanup work should be fully exposed. The seven major tasks decided by the Party Central Committee are very inspiring, and people are most concerned about how the central government will eliminate corruption among high-ranking officials. Whether it can win the trust of the people can almost be said to depend on this. It must be done with great determination and boldness, otherwise it will not be enough to eliminate corruption. The

The rectification and cleanup of companies should not be overestimated. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should play a supervisory role

He Ying, a member, said that since the reform, we have established many companies, some of which have played a role in promoting commodity circulation, developing the economy, and promoting development-oriented production. But overall, there are too many companies in the circulation sector. The work of rectifying and cleaning up companies has only achieved initial results and should not be overestimated. It must be continued and carried through to the end. Only in this way can we account to the people. It is absolutely not allowed to go through the motions, nor to retreat when encountering difficulties or to give up halfway. This rectification and cleanup is related to the overall situation of rectification, rectification, and deepening of reform, and it is related to the punishment of corruption and the construction of clean government. The rectification and cleanup of companies is not only an economic issue but also a very serious political issue. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress must fully play its supervisory role. To do a good job in this regard, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and use public opinion. Some major cases should be publicly reported.

Duan Suquan, a member, said that the rectification and cleanup of companies is just the beginning, and in the future, it should be carried out in earnest. The focus should be on rectifying and cleaning up the companies under the State Council. The current rectification of the five major companies is still on the books, and it is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation of their large-scale rebates, import and export license handling fees, as well as the buying and selling of import and export licenses, buying and selling of foreign exchange, and financial loan guarantee commissions.

Deng Jiatai, a member, said that regarding the report on the rectification and cleanup of companies, I think that various levels of industrial and commercial management departments have done a lot of work and found many problems, which is commendable and should be affirmed. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should supervise the work of rectifying and cleaning up companies to ensure that the work of rectifying and cleaning up companies is done well. I do not agree with the "self-inspection" method. It is necessary to mobilize the masses and organize various levels of government departments, deputies to the National People's Congress, and members of the Political Consultative Conference to participate in a comprehensive investigation of all companies. Those who engage in illegal buying and selling and bribery, especially major cases, must be thoroughly investigated, and it is absolutely not allowed to go through the motions.

The rectification and cleanup should start from the central government

Zhou Zhan'ao, a member, said that the rectification and cleanup of companies should start from the central government. Once the central government is transparent, the local governments will also be transparent. It is requested that experts and relevant personnel from various provinces and cities come to investigate the companies at the central level, and the grassroots level monitors the central government, so the effect will be better. The rectification and cleanup of companies should be done equally. The central, provincial, municipal, and grassroots levels should all be involved. It should start from major cases, start from cadres, and formulate some measures to manage companies and cadres well.

Wei Minghai, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Shaanxi Province, said that the specific cases listed in the report are all local cases, while those at the central level are not listed. The various departments under the State Council have hundreds of companies with import and export rights and preferential treatment. This has not been listed as a key point in this report. The central government should set an example and take a few major cases in the companies run by the central government, resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and win the trust of the people.

Strengthen economic legislation and strengthen the management of companies

Wu Dakun, a member, said that the current companies have many problems, which have caused dissatisfaction among the people and must be rectified. Regarding the legislation of companies, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should take collective action and suggest that the Financial and Economic Committee of the National People's Congress participate in the legislation from the perspective of the National People's Congress. From a modern perspective, China's modern companies, in terms of quantity and quality, are still not enough compared to the West. In the process of rectification and cleanup, it should not be overdone, and it is still necessary to support a batch of beneficial companies, otherwise it would be a negative rectification. It is suggested that the State Planning Commission draft an opinion to plan the national industries and sectors that need to vigorously develop modern companies, so as to reflect the state's planned and organized leadership over the development of companies.

Deng Jiatai, a member, said that companies that meet the needs of developing commodity economy and engage in legitimate business should be retained and managed. Companies that violate laws and disciplines and engage in illegal buying and selling should be resolutely investigated and dealt with, regardless of who is involved, and they should be severely punished according to the law and publicized. In this regard, if only the illegal gains are confiscated (which is necessary), but the illegal acts of the perpetrators are not seriously dealt with, it will not be possible to fundamentally punish official profiteering and eliminate corruption.

Hu Daiguang, a member, suggested that the Company Law should be promulgated as soon as possible. At the same time, according to the current situation, the specific regulations for the approval and management of companies should be formulated first to prevent the phenomenon of excessive companies from continuing to occur.

    人大常委会进行分组审议和讨论
    建议居委会组织法尽快出台  强调彻底搞好清理整顿公司
    新华社北京8月30日电　出席七届全国人大常委会第九次会议的委员，昨天下午分组审议了城市居民委员会组织法草案。委员们认为，制定居委会组织法很有必要，建议尽快出台。同时他们就草案中一些问题提出了修改意见。
    杨烈宇委员说，以前我们有城市居民委员会组织条例遵循，且有较好的积极作用。但经过文化大革命，居委会工作大大削弱了，而且城市本身和街道居民构成变化很大，现在需要从法律上加以明确，建立组织，使之发挥更好的作用，客观上也是为人民群众所欢迎的，建议尽快审议通过执行。
    张忱委员说，城市居委会工作，是城市发动群众、依靠群众做好基层工作重要的组成部分。制定组织法对居委会工作提供法律依据和保障，加强城市居委会工作很必要。
    徐运北、何浣芬、周占鳌委员认为，居委会是城市社会细胞，搞好了，有利于贯彻党和国家的路线、方针、政策。这次暴乱反映了城市基层中存在很多问题。居委会的工作需要大大改进和加强，应坚持社会主义方向，在此法中应明确如何坚持四项基本原则。
    郭力文委员说，从我国国情来看，居委会不仅是自我管理、自我教育、自我服务的组织，而且应该接受党和政府的领导，不能只强调自治性这一面。
    郝诒纯委员说，居委会应做为人民群众与人民政权的联系纽带，居委会任务主要是维护居民合法权益；办理居民公共事务和公益事业；以及办理居民的生活服务。其他各项任务则处于协助地位，否则任务太重了。应规定居委会由居民会议或居民代表会议产生。
    王厚德委员说，居委会组织法是一个重要的法律，它和村委会组织法一样，是两个有关人民实行自我管理、自我教育、自我服务的法律。我们的其他法律几乎都是管人的，只有这两个法律是群众拥有自治权的。现在的问题是基层政权组织很乱，有的几乎瘫痪，基层中干群关系紧张，实行群众自治的小环境还有问题。需要有个好的执法环境，才能保证它的贯彻执行。
    新华社北京8月30日电　七届人大常委会第9次会议今天分组讨论了国家工商行政管理局局长任中林受国务院委托所做的关于清理整顿公司的报告。委员们肯定了前一段时间清理整顿公司所取得的成绩，同时提出，要进一步下大决心，把这一有关取信于民的重要政策不失时机地贯彻下去。
    清理整顿公司认识要清楚，态度要坚决
    胡代光委员说，各部门对清理整顿公司做了不少工作，取得一定成效，但还只是初步的，还远远没有达到预期的效果。因此，不能满足，要下定决心解决公司过滥、过热的问题。认识要清楚，态度要坚决。群众关心的不是罚款问题，而是对违法行为究竟怎样处理。现在让犯有贪污、受贿、投机倒把行为的人在规定的期限内坦白交待，对积极退赃者依法从轻、减轻或免予处罚，否则依法从严惩处。群众认为，这项政策现在起到了一些作用，但作用还不够，应造成声势，及时公布一些从严处理的典型案件，以便更好地更有力地使清理整顿公司的工作取得彻底胜利。
    爱新觉罗·溥杰委员认为，要认清清理整顿的复杂性和有关全局的严重性，否则会酿成不治之症。首先是从上到下、从中央到地方人人有责、人人有份，决不能用一阵风式的办法，尤其不能雷声大雨点小，或是掩掩盖盖，更不能上松下紧。
    丁光训委员说，任中林局长的汇报不能令人满意。对人大常委会作汇报，应当有更多的透明度，把清理整顿工作中的困难、干扰充分揭开。党中央决定要做的7件事很振奋人心，人们最关注的是中央怎样清除高干中间存在的腐败现象。能不能取信于民，几乎可以说在此一举。一定要雷厉风行，大刀阔斧，不如此不足以消除腐败现象。对
    清理整顿公司工作不能估计过高  人大常委会要发挥监督作用
    何英委员说，改革以来，我们成立了很多公司，有些公司发挥了促进商品流通、发展经济、推动开发性生产的作用。但从总体上看，流通领域中的公司是太多了。清理整顿公司的工作，只取得了初步成效，不能估计过高，要继续抓下去，抓到底。这样才能向人民交待。绝不能走过场，决不能遇难而退、半途而废。这次清理整顿，关系到治理、整顿和深化改革的全局，关系到惩治腐败和廉政建设。清理整顿公司不仅是经济问题，而且是一个非常严肃的政治问题。全国人大常委会必须充分发挥监督作用。抓好这项工作，要发动群众，要利用舆论力量，一些大案要案要公开报道。
    段苏权委员说，整顿公司仅仅是开始，今后还应扎扎实实搞下去，集中力量清理整顿好国务院所属的公司。对5大公司的清理目前还是帐簿上的，还应对其大宗的回扣，进出口许可证手续费以及买卖进出口许可证，买卖外汇，金融借贷担保酬金等作彻底清查。
    邓家泰委员说，关于清理整顿公司的汇报，我认为各级工商管理部门做了大量工作，查出了许多问题，是有成绩的，应当肯定。人大常委会对清理整顿公司的工作应进行监督，确保清理整顿公司的工作抓紧抓好。清理整顿办法，我不赞成“自查”。应发动群众，组织各级政府部门、人大代表、政协委员参加，对所有公司广泛进行一次普查，对那些倒买倒卖、行贿受贿的坏人坏事，特别是大案、要案，一定要彻底查清，决不能走过场。
    清理整顿要从中央做起
    周占鳌委员说，清理、整顿公司，要从中央抓起，中央透明了，地方也就透明了，请各省市的专家、有关人士来查中央一级的公司，由基层来监督中央，这样效果就会好些。清理、整顿公司要一律平等。中央、省市、基层一块抓。要从大案要案抓起，要从干部抓起，要制订一些措施、管好公司、管好干部。
    陕西省人大常委会副主任韦明海说，报告中所列的具体案件，都是一些地方的案子，而中央一级的没有列举。国务院所属各部门有几百个公司都有进出口权，都有优惠。这次报告中没有将这个列为重点。中央机关应起表率作用，在中央机关所办公司中实实在在地抓一两件大案，坚决贯彻四中全会的精神和党中央、国务院的决定，取信于民。
    要加强经济立法工作  加强对公司的管理
    吴大琨委员说，现有的公司有很多问题，引起人民的不满，非整顿不可。关于公司立法问题，全国人大常委会应有个集体行动，建议全国人大财经委从人大的角度参与立法。从现代化的角度看，我国的现代化公司与西方相比，数量和质量上都还不够，在整顿清理的过程中，不要过头，尚需扶持一批有益的公司，否则就形成消极地整顿。建议国家计委起草一份意见，全面规划一下全国哪些行业、领域需要大力发展现代化公司，以体现国家对公司发展的有计划、有组织的领导。
    邓家泰委员说，对那些符合发展商品经济需要、正当经营的公司，应予保留，并加强管理。对那些违法乱纪、倒买倒卖的公司要坚决查处，不管涉及什么人，都应依法严办、并公布于众。在这方面如果仅仅没收非法所得（这是应当的），而不严肃处理违法犯罪的当事人，就不可能从根本上惩治官倒、消除腐败现象。
    胡代光委员建议，应尽快制定公司法。同时，根据目前情况，首先将公司审批、管理的具体条例制定出来，防止公司过滥的现象继续发生。
