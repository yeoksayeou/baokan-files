Early in June, shortly after the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Tangshan Iron and Steel Company held a meeting for managers and above. At the meeting, the company's manager, Tian Xie'en, solemnly said, "Comrades, the current severe situation is before us. Our company's two key projects are at a critical stage of debugging, and most of the experts have withdrawn, posing a serious threat to the projects. We have no other choice. We must mobilize the workers and rely on our own strength to face the difficulties head-on."

The expansion of the iron smelting project and the high-speed wire rolling mill project are key projects of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan," with a total investment of nearly 900 million yuan. Most of the equipment is imported from abroad and represents the advanced level of the 1980s internationally. After they are put into production, they will produce 750,000 tons of iron and 350,000 tons of wire annually, making them the lifeline projects of Tangshan Steel. Now that the experts have withdrawn, what should we do? If we stop and wait, we will incur a loan interest of 180,000 yuan per day and affect efficiency by 300,000 yuan. Moreover, delaying the schedule will disrupt the entire project plan and put us at a disadvantage. The company leadership decided to mobilize the workers to overcome the difficulties.

For the iron smelting furnace, debugging started from the raw material system. Workers worked more than 12 hours a day, with some working day and night. Their work was meticulous. They revised the design of the material yard more than 50 times, modified 60 pieces of equipment, and discovered an error made by the foreign experts during installation, thus avoiding an equipment accident. During the debugging of the furnace top material system, they encountered a problem where the special module could not input data. They sent a telegram to the foreign company, but there was no reply. In this situation, they were not deterred by the difficulties. They consulted a large amount of technical materials, verified thousands of data points, and corrected the errors in the original design, solving the problem. The foreign company had estimated that the debugging of the furnace top material system would take at least one and a half months. However, they completed the task in just 20 days, ensuring both quality and quantity.

In contrast to the iron furnace, the biggest challenge in debugging the high-speed wire rolling mill was the rear process of the pressing and bundling machine. After the foreign experts withdrew, due to technical secrecy, they only left outline drawings without dimensions, and some drawings did not match the actual equipment. The members of the factory's attack team dismantled the equipment piece by piece during the day, verified each circuit, and calculated each data point. At night, they studied the drawings and documents, often working through the night. After dozens of on-site trials, they finally successfully produced the first roll of wire on July 16. The cable frame of the PF drawing machine is made of cast aluminum and was introduced from abroad with the equipment. During the installation process, due to the carelessness of the construction unit, the frame developed cracks. The foreign experts had determined before their withdrawal that it was beyond repair and a new set of equipment had to be imported. To save foreign exchange, "Welding Champion" Yang Shunxing repeatedly experimented and finally succeeded in welding it with argon arc welding.

    唐钢工人的志气
    邢鸿儒
    6月初，在北京刚刚发生反革命暴乱后不久的一个早上，唐山钢铁公司召开了一次厂处以上的干部会议。会上，公司经理田锡恩严肃地说：“同志们，当前严峻的形势摆到了我们面前，我公司两项重点工程在调试的关键时刻，大部分专家相继撤离，给工程造成严重威胁。我们没有别的选择。只有发动职工，依靠自己的力量，迎难而上。”
    扩建炼铁工程和高速线材轧机工程是国家“七五”重点建设项目，总投资近9亿元，大部分设备从国外引进，具有80年代国际先进水平。投产后，年产铁75万吨，线材35万吨，是唐钢的命脉工程。现在专家撤离了，怎么办？停下来等，一天就要付出贷款利息18万元，影响效益30万元，而且延误工期将会打乱全部工程计划，造成被动。公司领导决定发动职工，闯过难关。
    炼铁高炉从原料系统开始调试，工人每天工作12小时以上，有的昼夜奋战，工作一丝不苟，仅一次料场设计就更改50多项，改造设备60多项，并发现一起原外国专家安装的错误，避免了设备事故。在高炉上料系统调试中遇到了难题，炉顶特殊模块调试时打不进数据，给外商打电传，迟迟没有回音。在这种情况下，他们没有被困难吓倒，查阅了大量技术资料，核对了上千个数据，修改了原设计上的错误，使问题迎刃而解。原外商预定高炉上料系统调试，至少用一个半月时间，结果他们仅用20天就保质保量完成了任务。
    与高炉相反，高速线材轧机调试的最大难题是后部工序的压紧打捆机。外国专家撤离后由于技术保密，只留下没有尺寸的外型图，而且有的图纸与实物不符。厂攻关小组的同志们，白天围着设备一个部件一个部件地手拆，一条线路一条线路地校验，一个数据一个数据地计算；夜晚查阅资料，研究图纸，一干就是一个通宵。经过数十次现场试验，终于在7月16日成功地打出了第一卷线材。PF件打图机的托缆架是铸铝材质，由国外随设备引进。在安装过程中，因施工单位不慎，缆架出现裂纹，外国专家撤离前曾认定要报废，不能修复，必须再引进一套新设备。公司“焊工状元”杨顺兴为节省外汇，反复试验，终于用氩弧焊接成功。
