    Scientific investigations and research have shown that the massive forest fire in the Great Xing'anling region two years ago not only severely affected the forest landscape in this area but also had a significant impact on the local ecological environment.

    In a research report recently released, Associate Director of the Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Researcher Xiao Duning pointed out that this fire caused a major change in the natural forest landscape. The original forest vegetation types were destroyed, and forest regeneration had to start anew.

    The massive forest fire that occurred in May 1987 in the northern part of the Great Xing'anling, China's largest natural forest area, in the Da Xing'anling larch forest region, lasted for more than 20 days, burning an area of 1.3 million hectares and destroying 80 million cubic meters of standing timber.

    The research report believes that although most of the dead trees can be utilized, the severely burned areas have basically lost their natural regeneration capacity. The potential growth capacity and reserve resources of the forest have been far more severely damaged than the current forest resources.

    The report points out that the large area of this forest fire will inevitably affect changes in the regional microclimate, increasing the likelihood of soil erosion and floods. Additionally, sunny slopes will become more arid, while low-lying areas will experience increased marshland formation. The animal and plant populations in the forest will also undergo corresponding changes, with bears and deer either burned to death or fleeing, and birds like hazel grouse experiencing a sharp decline. Notably, because this fire spread along the river valleys, it will have a significant impact on corridor species.

    Xiao Duning believes that most of the burned forest areas can be restored through natural regeneration and artificial promotion of natural regeneration. However, for the 200,000 hectares of burned areas without mother trees, artificial reforestation and planting measures must be taken. After completing the forest regeneration task in the disaster area within 5 to 8 years, this region will form a new landscape pattern.

### 森林景观被毁　生态环境受损  大兴安岭火灾后果严重

    森林景观被毁　生态环境受损
    大兴安岭火灾后果严重
    据新华社沈阳8月2日电　（记者李希光）科学考察与研究表明，两年前的大兴安岭特大森林火灾，不仅对这一地区的森林景观，而且对这里的生态环境，都造成了严重影响。
    中国科学院沈阳应用生态研究所副所长肖笃宁研究员在日前公布的一份研究报告中指出，这场大火使天然林区的森林景观发生了重大变化，原来的森林植被类型被烧毁，森林更新被迫重新开始。
    1987年5月在我国最大的天然林区大兴安岭北部的兴安落叶松林区发生的这一场历时20多天的特大森林火灾，燃烧面积达130万公顷，过火森林蓄积量8000万立方米。
    研究报告认为，虽然死亡树木的木材绝大部分可以利用，但严重火烧材地区基本上失去了天然更新的能力。森林潜在生长能力和后备资源的损失远大于森林资源现存量的损失。
    报告指出，这次森林大火面积之大还必将影响区域小气候发生变化，水土流失和洪水发生的可能性增大。此外，局部阳坡有旱生化，低平地则会加重沼泽化。林区的动植物种群也有相应变化，熊、鹿等动物被烧死或逃走，榛鸡等鸟类急剧减少。特别值得注意的是，因为这次火灾沿河谷推进，对走廊物种将会产生较大影响。
    肖笃宁认为，大部分过火林地可通过天然更新和人工促进天然更新来恢复森林资源，但对于20万公顷的无母树火烧迹地，必须采取人工补播和植苗等措施。5至8年完成灾区森林更新任务后，这一地区将形成新的景观格局。
