A large factory with a workforce of tens of thousands, Tianjin Alkali Plant has weathered 70 years of storms and stands at the forefront of China's chemical industry. Like countless other enterprises in China, it faces sharp challenges in the waves of commodity economy and the clash of old and new values.

Ideals cannot be bought with money

On June 13, a train loaded with raw materials finally entered the factory after being delayed for several days, immediately sparking a wave of cheers. The reporter happened to be at Tianjin Alkali Plant that day. Party Secretary Zhao Kuisheng explained to me the significance of this cheer.

As early as the 1980s, Tianjin Alkali Plant was renowned nationwide for its "Three Histories" education. They systematically educated the young workers about modern Chinese history, party history, and factory history, opening a window to the national situation for them. This helped them understand the hardships of the past, appreciate the hard-won progress, and grasp the historical logic that without the Communist Party there would be no New China and only socialism can save China. This had a good effect on the young workers.

However, in recent years, ideological and political work has faced severe tests:

"Now it's all about practical benefits. Give enough money and everything is easy."

"Preaching is outdated. Now is the era of dialogue."

Zhao Kuisheng shared his views with the reporter:

"Practical benefits and equal dialogue are both necessary. Empty preaching and the 'I hit you, you understand' approach have never worked. In the new era, we should have new language and new methods."

At Tianjin Alkali Plant, there is a modern atmosphere. The economic responsibility system is implemented layer by layer, rewarding diligence and punishing laziness. There have been 380-plus heart-to-heart discussions on price issues. The factory's closed-circuit television broadcasts the top 10 news figures of the month, all of whom are ordinary people from the front lines, each with their own strengths. Multi-level training classes are held to popularize quality management. On weekend evenings, there are sometimes popular songs...

"But there is one thing we have consistently adhered to. The main body of economic construction is people. People should have the correct ideals. And ideals cannot be bought with money, nor can they grow spontaneously."

In recent years, Tianjin Alkali Plant has proposed a "One-Four-One" policy for ideological and political work: focusing on development, conducting education on the four cardinal principles, and taking young workers as the key. In addition to the "Three Histories" education, they have extended to education on common ideals, legal education, and professional ethics. During the systematic education of young workers, they engage in dialogue where appropriate and give lectures where appropriate. This has laid a foundation for helping young people gain a broad vision and breadth of mind.

Under the influence of the "everything for money" wind, some young workers once complained that soda ash has low profits and that other factories have higher bonuses, considering "jumping ship." Through systematic education, they have had new thoughts: 10,000 tons of soda ash, though only sold for over 400 million yuan, injects vitality into thousands of metallurgy, chemical, petroleum, textile, and other enterprises, creating over 20 billion yuan in economic benefits. A sense of pride replaced the sense of loss. During the second quarter's turmoil and riots, the railway was disrupted for many days, and raw materials were in short supply. The workers did everything possible to dig out the remaining inventory. Even those who had disagreements on personal issues strictly disciplined themselves and stood their posts. A miracle is that at this critical moment, the factory's soda ash production increased by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.

Actions speak louder than words

Surrounding issues of improper conduct and unfair distribution, thousands of eyes are fixed on the actions of party members and cadres. Any stain or corruption on the party's body will be met with public outrage. The Tianjin Alkali Plant Party Committee believes that integrity is more important than words in today's ideological and political work. With this in mind, they have formulated "Ten Regulations on Rectifying Party Style, Factory Style, and Strengthening Organizational Discipline" for "accident-prone links" and have agreed to practice what they preach.

People's eyes are a scale. The public praises these actions: At the end of 1988, Tianjin Alkali Plant recruited workers, and "letters of recommendation" flew in like snowflakes, with old superiors and old colleagues asking for favors... The factory party committee decisively made the recruitment system and results public, widely accepting public supervision, and eliminating all backdoor deals. Party Committee member and deputy factory director Zhang Zhenxin went to Sweden for negotiations, and the other party gave him a return ticket. Someone suggested reporting it together, but Zhang insisted: "Unjustified gains, not a penny taken."

Discipline is strict because rewards and punishments are clear. A staff member in the spare parts department received a bribe of 8,000 yuan when purchasing equipment and was arrested and prosecuted. The same department's party member Li Zhigang refused a bribe of over 9,000 yuan when purchasing goods and was publicly commended.

Diligence can make up for shortcomings, and frugality can cultivate integrity. At Tianjin Alkali Plant, cadres still insist on the old tradition of participating in voluntary labor every week. This is not just a stroll, "just for show." The lime kiln forms lumps that need to be immediately removed, and the temperature inside reaches 140 degrees. If you wait for it to cool down, it will delay production. The cadres put on asbestos clothes and take turns crawling in to smash the lumps, often fighting for three days and nights, sweating profusely, until they win completely. Cleaning the ammonia tower is stuffy and irritating, but no one wrinkles their brows. At the end of last year, the party branch secretary of the casting workshop, Li, led the team to work continuously for four shifts to remove 120 tons of lime, with lime burning their eyes and skin, but not a word was said. The young people gave him a thumbs up: "Well done!" This factory's party members and activists have participated in over 6,600 activities to serve the people in the first quarter of this year alone, and they feel a special kind of joy from this.

A bookkeeper from Shanghai's industrial sector asked Zhao Kuisheng when he visited Tianjin Alkali Plant: "In special circumstances, do you have confidence that your factory will not cause trouble?"

Zhao Kuisheng calculated:

"Party members account for 16.6% of the total workforce, evenly distributed in offices and front-line positions, with a good vanguard role. Over 900 applicants for party membership, plus cadres and activists from all sides, account for over 70% of the advantage in the entire factory. We have confidence."

Life has proven his judgment: the fighting strength of the party organization is the foundation of the enterprise's prosperity and the pillar in the storm.

"The herd has become a thoroughbred"

The tide of reform and opening up has made workers' thoughts more active than ever. After more than 70 springs and autumns, Tianjin Alkali Plant is facing a critical period of replacing old and new equipment and management. This factory still has American machines from the 1920s in operation, urgently needing to open its arms to fully absorb advanced technology from home and abroad.

However, there have been various discussions:

"Why do our money all go to the 'foreigners'?"

"In the past, it was military invasion, now it is economic invasion!"

The Tianjin Alkali Plant Party Committee, in its systematic education of young people, combines adhering to the four cardinal principles with adhering to reform and opening up, explaining the logic that closing the door and locking it up will never get rid of backwardness, and that opening up to the outside world is necessary for modernization. They explain: patriotism cannot be blindly xenophobic, nor can it be sycophantic to foreigners...

The resolution of ideological knots has released endless vitality. In recent years, Tianjin Alkali Plant has absorbed advanced technology from all over the world, introducing or designing and installing the largest carbonization tower and soda ash filter in the country today, making the matched soda ash production equipment highly efficient.

The road of introducing technology and equipment is also not smooth. At the end of last year, an 800-ton steam calcination furnace was introduced from abroad, and the production capacity was only 200 tons during the trial run last year. Factory director Cai Chaoqun and chief engineer Chen Yaohan organized a breakthrough, and the technical personnel collectively improved the fully enclosed rotating valve of the imported steam furnace and adjusted the voltage and current. Then, they politely invited the foreign experts to see. With a press of the button, the motor spun rapidly, quickly reaching the designed capacity.

Indeed, the Chinese people adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and release the enormous energy that comes from it. Who can measure it? In two and a half years, Tianjin Alkali Plant has transformed the small, low-efficiency, high-consumption "herd" on the equipment into large, high-efficiency, low-consumption "thoroughbreds." The world-renowned "Red Triangle" soda ash has leaped from 90,000 tons in the early days of liberation to 580,000 tons. Last year, Tianjin Alkali Plant achieved synchronous growth in seven areas: soda ash production, sales revenue, realized profits and taxes, and workers' income. In the first half of this year, they continued their efforts and achieved half the time, half the production task. This steady and solid pace tells us a lot, a lot...

    “红三角”的闪光点
     ——天津碱厂思想政治工作采风
    本报记者  肖荻
    万人大厂、历经70年风风雨雨，立于国内化工先列的天津碱厂，在商品经济浪潮的激荡和新旧价值观念的碰撞中，像中国千千万万个企业一样，面对着种种尖锐的较量……
          理想，不是钱能买来的
    6月13日，满载原材料的火车在隔绝多日后驶进厂区，顿时引起一阵欢呼。记者恰在那天到天碱采访。党委书记赵魁生向我解释了全厂这一欢呼声的内涵。
    早在80年代初，天碱以开展“三史”教育闻名全国。他们以中国近代史、党史、厂史的系统教育，在全厂青工面前打开中国国情的窗子，让大家明白祖国灾难深重的过去，深知今天的进步来之不易，懂得没有共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义才能救中国的历史逻辑，在青年中收到良好效果。
    但，近年来，思想政治工作经受着严峻的考验：
    “现在讲的是实惠，钱儿给足嘛都好办。”
    “说教已经过时，现在是对话的时代。”
    赵魁生向记者谈到他们的见解：
    “经济实惠，平等对话，都是必要的。空洞说教，‘我打你通’那一套，什么时候也不行。新时期，更应该有新的语言，新的作法。”
    在天碱，不乏现代生活气息。奖勤罚懒的经济承包层层落实。围绕物价问题进行的对话，推心置腹，达380多次。厂区闭路电视每月放映当选的10大新闻人物，那都是第一线的普通人，各有所长。多层次培训班上在普及质量管理学。周末晚会上，有时兴的通俗歌曲……
      “但，有一点我们又是一贯坚持的。经济建设的主体是人。人就应有正确的理想。而理想是不能用钱买来的，也是不可能自发成长的。”
    天碱几年来在思想政治工作上提出一个“一四一”方针，即围绕发展这个中心，进行四项基本原则教育，并以青工为重点。他们除“三史”教育，又延伸到共同理想教育、法制教育、职业道德教育。他们在进行青工轮训教育时，宜对话者则对话，宜讲课者则讲课。这些，在帮助青年获得一个宏阔的视野和胸襟上，铺下了基石。
    在“一切向钱看”之风吹打下，曾有些青工埋怨纯碱微利，不如别厂奖金高，寻思“跳槽”。通过系统教育有了新的思考：1万吨纯碱虽仅售400多万元，但为千万家冶金、化工、石油、纺织……企业注入活力，可创造20多亿元经济效益。自豪感代替了失落感。二季度动乱、暴乱中铁路中断多日，原料告急。职工们千方百计，把库存挖地3尺。就连平时在一些个人问题上有歧见的人，也严格自律，坚守岗位。一个奇迹是，在这一严峻时刻，这个厂纯碱的产量比去年同期增长3.9％。
        身教重于言教
    围绕风气不正和分配不公等敏感点，千百双眼睛盯紧党员和干部的举手投足。党的肌体上任何玷污和腐败，都会招致群众愤懑地戳脊梁骨。天碱党委认为，廉政，在今天的思想政治工作中，身教重于言教。有鉴于此，他们针对“事故多发环节”，制定了《关于端正党风、厂风，加强组织纪律性的十项规定》，相约身体力行。
    人眼是个秤。群众称道这些作法：1988年底天碱招工，“条子”雪片般飞来，老上级、老同事请求照顾……厂党委断然公开招工制度和结果，广泛接受群众监督，杜绝一切后门。厂党委委员、副厂长张振新去瑞典洽谈，对方赠回程票，有人主张一起报销，老张坚持：非分之财，不取分文。
    纪律严明，在于奖惩分明。备件科一干部在订购设备时收受贿赂8000元，被逮捕法办。同科室的党员李志刚在订货时拒贿9000多元，被公开表彰。
    勤能补拙，俭以养廉。在天碱，干部依然坚持每周参加义务劳动的老传统。那不是去蹓跶一趟，“意思意思”。白灰窑结瘤需立即排除，那里面高温达140度，如等冷却下来就要延误生产。干部们穿上石棉衣，轮流钻进去冲砸结瘤，常常苦战三昼夜，一个个大汗淋漓，直至全胜方休。清理蒸氨塔又闷又呛，没有谁蹙头。去年底，铸造车间党支部李书记为清除120吨白灰，带队连续奋战4个班，叫白灰烧红眼睛，烫破皮肤，一声不吭，被青年们挑大拇指：好样的！这个厂的党员和积极分子，仅今年第一季度就有6600多人参予为群众办实事的奉献活动，他们由此感受到一种格外的愉快。
    上海一位管工业的书记来天碱参观时曾问赵魁生：“在特殊情况下，你们厂有把握不闹事吗？”
    赵魁生一算：
      “党员占职工总数16.6％，科室、一线分布均匀，先锋作用良好。900多名申请入党积极分子，加上干部和各方面积极分子，在全厂占70％以上优势。我们有信心。”
    生活证实他的判断：党组织的战斗力，是企业兴旺之本，是风浪里的中流砥柱。
      “羊群”变成了“骏马”
    改革、开放新潮涌动，职工思想空前活跃。度过70多个春秋的天碱面临新老设备和经营管理大交替的关键期。这个厂迄今还有20年代美国老机器在运转，迫切需要张开双臂充分吸取国内外的先进技术。
    但是，出现了种种议论：
    “我们的钱，为什么都让‘老外’赚走了？”
    “过去是军事侵略，现在是经济侵略！”
    天碱党委在对青年进行系统教育中，把坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革、开放结合起来，讲清闭关锁国永远摆脱不了落后，对外开放是现代化建设所必需的道理。讲清：爱国，既不能盲目排外，也不能崇洋媚外……
    思想疙瘩的化解引发了生生不已的活力。几年来，天碱多方吸收国外先进技术，引进或设计安装了当今国内最大的碳化塔、滤碱机，使成龙配套的制碱设备实现了高效化。
    引进技术和设备的道路也并不平坦。前年底，从国外引进设计能力为800吨的蒸汽煅烧炉，去年试车，产量仅达200吨。厂长蔡超群、总工陈耀汉组织攻关，技术人员群策群力逐一改进了进口蒸汽炉的全封闭转动阀，调整了电压、电流。而后彬彬有礼地将外国专家请来一视。一按电钮，电机飞快转动，迅速达到设计能力。
    确实，中国人坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革、开放，从而释放出来的巨大能量，谁能估得透呢？历时两年半，天碱使设备上的小型、低效、高耗的“羊群”，一跃而为大型、高效、低耗的“骏马”。蜚声全球的“红三角”纯碱从解放初年产9万吨跃为58万吨。去年天碱实现了纯碱产量、销售总额、实现利税、职工收入等7个同步增长。今年上半年再接再厉，又实现了时间过半、完成生产任务过半。这一稳健扎实的脚步告诉我们的信息很多，很多……
