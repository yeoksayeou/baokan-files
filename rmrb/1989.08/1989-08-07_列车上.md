Title: On the Train

One evening this spring, my wife and I were waiting in the soft-seat waiting room of a train station to board a train back to Beijing. Around 9:30 PM, a group of passengers rushed in. Two elderly people dressed in jackets and trousers, carrying small bags and dragging large ones, sat down on the opposite sofa. A few fashionably dressed young people followed, pushing and pulling luggage, as if they were seeing them off. Strangely, after the elderly people sat down, they still held onto their belongings tightly, as if afraid of losing them.

The two elderly people, one wearing a yellow cap and the other with short gray hair, one fat and one thin, both were tall and in their eighties. They didn't look like overseas Chinese or Hong Kong and Macau compatriots; they were likely Taiwanese Nationalist Party veterans.

The service staff called for boarding, and the passengers rushed to the platform. My wife and I followed behind, boarded the soft-sleeper car, and found our berths. On the opposite berth, the elderly man wearing the cap was sitting, with a young man beside him speaking in Beijing dialect, insisting on exchanging foreign currency.

"Give me some! Just a little!" the young man pleaded.

"I went home last year and didn't bring much money this year," the elderly man replied in a Henan accent, repeatedly saying these two sentences.

The two engaged in a tug-of-war. The elderly man looked worried and fearful; the young man's tone was urgent, unwilling to give up.

I couldn't bear to watch anymore and said to the young man, "Don't be shameful! These people have been away for decades to visit their relatives on the mainland. Why are you pressuring him?"

"Shameful? What's shameful?" the young hoodlum looked at me, an old man, daring to interfere, blocking his path to money, and shouted at me, "I'm offering a high price to exchange! What business is it of yours?"

"This is currency speculation! It's illegal! Anyone can intervene!" I shouted back, "If you don't leave, I'll call the train police!"

The young hoodlum, caught off guard, backed down, glaring at me before slinking away. Soon, one of his accomplices stood outside the window, shaking his fist and shouting obscenities, "Old man! Do you dare to come down?"

"I'm afraid of you? You're the one doing wrong and causing trouble!" I shouted back.

A young man in a red shirt walked past the cabin door and threw down two sentences, which I recognized as one of the hoodlums' accomplices.

"Don't argue! We're all countrymen!"

The thin elderly veteran dragged his luggage back, saying that the man in the red shirt had taken him to another cabin, insisting on exchanging foreign currency. He had no choice but to give him 20 yuan, which is why he looked so pleased earlier.

"Don't tell anyone," the thin elderly veteran warned, still shaken.

I asked how they got tangled up with them, and the fat elderly veteran explained, "As soon as we arrived at the station, they surrounded us, saying they would help the elderly with their luggage. We didn't trust them and didn't let go, but they insisted on following us onto the train."

During the conversation, the fat elderly veteran said his surname was Cao, from Huixian, Henan, and the thin elderly veteran's surname was Liang, from Baoding, Hebei. Both were former Nationalist Party air force ground crew members who fled to Taiwan with the army forty years ago. After retiring, they lived in the countryside near Kaohsiung, relying on pensions for living, never remarrying, and living alone in a foreign land, constantly missing their families. Taiwan lifted restrictions, and Mr. Cao returned home last year, reuniting with his blind wife and grandchildren. This year, he encouraged his old colleague Mr. Liang to return with him. They arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong during the day and encountered this unpleasant incident on the train at night, making both of them very unhappy.

The train started, and the wheels rumbled, stirring my thoughts: After the opening up, a large number of tourists came from overseas, and last year tens of thousands of Taiwanese compatriots returned to the mainland to visit relatives. Customs, civil aviation, trains, hotels, and taxis are all windows to the country. Unfortunately, some management is not good, leaving a bad impression on visitors. Flights are delayed, taxis overcharge, and there are thefts, robberies, and violent incidents on trains! Since the Ministry of Railways stipulates that buying soft-sleeper tickets has level restrictions for mainland residents and checking IDs when boarding, why can a few hoodlums board the train freely? Is it because of a lack of responsibility? Fear of retaliation? Or is there another reason? I think these hoodlums must have extorted passengers on soft-sleeper cars before.

Thinking of this, I walked to the train crew's rest room. Inside, a male train attendant and a police officer were sitting. I told them what had just happened, and they said they didn't know.

"Since there have been serious incidents, regulations stipulate that buying soft-sleeper tickets has level restrictions, and IDs are checked when boarding, why are some shady characters allowed on the train?" I asked seriously.

"They don't necessarily come in through the main entrance; both ends of the car are connected," the train attendant said.

"Why not lock the doors at both ends when passengers board?"

"They can open them even if they are locked!" the train attendant looked at me impatiently and asked in return, "Who are you? Which unit do you work for?"

I said, "Anyone who encounters such a thing should intervene. Once passengers are on the train, you have the responsibility to protect them."

Just then, a female train attendant ran from the back car and told the police officer, "There's a fight over there, hurry up!"

"Damn it!" the police officer stood up and left. I returned to the cabin. The thin elderly veteran, Mr. Liang, was lying on the upper berth resting, and the fat elderly veteran, Mr. Cao, was sitting on the lower berth smoking, offering me a cigarette, saying it was from Taiwan. I couldn't refuse and took it, lighting it up.

"Tonight, I really appreciate your help, Mr. Cao, or I wouldn't know what to do," Mr. Cao sighed.

"Both of you rarely come back, and such a thing shouldn't have happened," I said apologetically.

Mr. Cao quickly changed the subject, "It's so troublesome to return to the mainland now! Every time you have to apply, return within the time limit, and go through Hong Kong. If you could come and go freely, fly directly from Taipei, it would save so much time and money! We are all Chinese!"

"That would be great!" I agreed, "I hope that day comes soon."

Mr. Cao lay down and fell asleep. I silently smoked, thinking deeply about the current social atmosphere...

    列车上
    白刃
    今年春天的一个晚上，在某火车站的软席候车室里，我和老伴等候乘列车回北京。21点多钟，门外涌进一群旅客。两个穿夹克衫西服裤的老人，提着小包拖着大包走到对面沙发，几个衣着新潮的青年跟着推拉行李，像是送客的，奇怪的是老人们坐下后，还抓紧自己的东西，似乎怕丢失。
    两个老人，一个头戴黄卡叽布帽，一个露着灰白短发，一个胖，一个瘦，都是古稀之年的高个子。不像海外华侨，不似港澳同胞，八成是来自台湾的国民党老兵。
    服务员招呼上车，旅客们拥向站台。我和老伴跟在后面，上了软卧车厢，找到包房睡铺。对面卧铺上，坐着那个戴帽的老人，身旁一个小伙子，一口北京腔，缠着老人要换外币。
    “换给一点吧！多少换一点吧！”
    “我去年回过一趟家，今年没带多少钱。”老人操着河南口音，不断重复这两句话。
    两人拉锯般地相持着。老者愁眉苦脸，为难加害怕；少的口气紧迫，不到手不罢休。
    我实在看不下去，厌恶地对那青年说：
    “别丢人啦！人家离开几十年回大陆探亲，干吗逼着他呢？”
    “丢什么人？”小痞子看我这老头儿，居然敢管闲事，破了他的财路，气汹汹地朝我嚷道：“我用高价给他换，你管得着吗？”
    “你这是套汇！犯法的！谁都可以管！”我大声喝道：“你再不走！我喊乘警啦！”
    小痞子做贼心虚，吃软不吃硬，果然站起来，恶狠狠瞪我一眼，灰溜溜走了。不一会儿，和他一个哥儿们，站在车窗外，向我挥着拳头，不干不净地喊着：
    “老家伙！你敢下来吗？”
    “我怕你呀？你这小子干了坏事，还撒野！”我也不示弱地吼着。
    包房门口走过一个穿红衬衫的青年，朝我们丢下两句话，我认出是小痞子的同伙。
    “别吵了！都是自家人嘛！”
    瘦高个老兵拖着行李回来，听说红衬衫挟他到另一包房，死缠着要换外币，没法子只得给他20块钱，怪不得刚才他那得意的样子。
    “可别说呀！”瘦老兵心有余悸地吩咐。
    我问怎么给他们缠上，胖老兵说道：
    “刚到车站，他们围上来，说是帮助老年人拿行李，我们不放心，不敢松手，他们硬跟着上车。”
    交谈中，胖老兵说他姓曹，河南辉县人，瘦老兵姓梁，河北保定人。两人都是原国民党空军地勤人员，四十年前随军逃到台湾，退伍后住在高雄乡间，靠养老金生活，没有再成家，孤独一身在异乡，日夜思念妻儿老少。台湾开禁，曹先生去年回来探亲，和双目失明的老妻及儿孙团圆。今年他鼓励旧同事梁先生结伴回来，白天从香港到广州，晚上就遇上这扫兴的窝囊事，弄得两人很不痛快。
    火车开了，车轮轰隆响，我的心潮跟着翻腾：开放以后，海外来了大量游客，去年几十万台胞回大陆探亲，海关、民航、火车、宾馆和出租汽车，全是国家的窗口，奈何有些管理偏偏不好，让人家带着坏印象出境，飞机晚点，“的士”敲竹杠，还有火车上盗窃、抢劫、行凶等恶性事件！既然铁道部规定买软卧车票，内地人限定级别，上车时检验证件，为什么几个小痞子可以随便上车？是责任心不强？是怕他们报复？还是另有文章？小痞子们上软卧车厢敲诈旅客，我想决非首次吧。
    想到这里，我不由走到列车员休息室。室内坐着一个男列车员和一个乘警，我告诉他们刚才的事，他们说不知道。
    “既然发生过恶性案件，规定乘软卧级别，上车时看证件，怎么随便让些不三不四的人上车。”我严肃地问。
    “他们不一定从正门上来，两头车厢都通着啦。”列车员说。
    “旅客上车时，为什么不把两头车门锁上？”
    “锁上他们也能开呀！”列车员不耐烦地瞧我一眼，反问道：“你是哪里的？什么单位？”
    我说：“任何人碰到这种事都该管。旅客上了车，你们有责任保护他们。”
    正说着，后面车厢跑来一个女列车员，对乘警说道：
    “那边打架了，快去！”
    “真要命！”乘警站起来走了，我回到包房里。瘦老兵梁先生在上铺躺下休息，胖老兵曹先生坐在下铺抽烟，递来一支香烟，说是台湾出的，我推辞不过，接着点了起来。
    “今晚上多亏您先生帮忙，不然我还不知道怎么好啦！”曹先生感叹地说。
    “二位难得回来一趟，本不该发生这种事呀！”我不无歉意地说。
    曹先生忙换个话题：“现在回大陆太麻烦！每次都要申请，限期回去，还要绕道到香港，要能自由来去，从台北直飞过来，该省多少时间和金钱呀！都是中国人嘛！”
    “那敢情好！”我赞同地说，“但愿这一天早日到来。”
    曹先生躺下睡着了。我默默抽着烟，沉重地想着，目前的社会风气……
