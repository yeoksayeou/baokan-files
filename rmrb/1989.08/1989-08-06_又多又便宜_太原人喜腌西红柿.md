Taiyuan residents, who enjoy noodles, have the habit of pickling tomatoes every year during the beginning of autumn. This year, Taiyuan residents are pleased to find that the market supply of tomatoes is both abundant and affordable.

The Taiyuan municipal government has arranged for the supply of 4.5 million kilograms of tomatoes in August, an increase of 1 million kilograms compared to the same period last year, with an average supply of nearly 3.5 kilograms per person in the city. The price of tomatoes in state-run vegetable markets remains the same as last year.

Relevant departments have established five prohibitions for the sale of tomatoes in state-run vegetable markets: no preferential sales to large buyers, no sales to resellers, no exports, no competition with the public for purchases by staff, and no supply to collective catering units.

    又多又便宜
    太原人喜腌西红柿
    据新华社太原8月6日电  （记者李仁虎）喜爱面食的太原人每年立秋时节都有腌制西红柿的习惯。今年令太原人高兴的是，市场上供应的西红柿又多又便宜。
    太原市政府8月份安排供应450万公斤西红柿，比去年同期增加100万公斤，全市人均供应近3.5公斤。国营菜市场西红柿售价与去年持平。
    有关部门为国营菜市场销售西红柿制订五不准：不准卖大户、不准卖给二道贩子、不准外销、职工不准和群众争购、不准供集体伙食单位。
