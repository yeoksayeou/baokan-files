In the tropical savannas of black Africa, there grows a peculiar tree known as the "snake tree" because its roots are an ideal remedy for snake bites.

Within the roots of this tree, there is a substance similar to snake venom, but it is harmless to humans. This substance can absorb venom and neutralize it. If this tree is planted around the perimeter of a house, even poisonous snakes will not dare to approach. Farmers dry the roots and grind them into powder, taking one gram before going to work, and they will not fear snake bites. If bitten by a poisonous snake, immediately taking the same dose can turn danger into safety. The roots of this tree are also an excellent remedy for rheumatism. If one contracts intestinal parasites, sprinkle a pinch of the powder into half a cup of water and drink it, repeating this for three days, and recovery is guaranteed. Nowadays, snake tree roots are a staple medicine in many households.

    蛇树
    在黑非洲的热带草原地区，生长着一种奇妙的树木，因树根是理想的蛇药，被人称之为
  “蛇树”。
    在这种树的根里，有一种类似蛇的毒液的物质，但对人体无害。这种物质可以吸收毒液，并使其解除武装。若在房屋四周种上此树，毒蛇甚至不敢靠近。农民将树根晒干研成粉末，去干活前服用一克，就不怕蛇咬。若被毒蛇咬伤，立即服用同等剂量，亦可化险为夷。这种树根还是治疗风湿性关节炎的良药。若是染上肠道寄生虫病，将一撮粉末撒进半杯水里喝下，连服三日，定能康复。现在，蛇树根已是许多家庭必备的常药。　（汝生）
