	Local authorities across the country are establishing teams of infectious disease management supervisors to build and improve the system for managing and supervising infectious diseases.

	According to information from the Ministry of Health, a group of infectious disease management supervisors will be appointed from health administrative departments and various levels of health and epidemic prevention institutions. These supervisors will strictly enforce the "Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases," which comes into effect on September 1. They will supervise and inspect the prevention, treatment, monitoring, control, and management of infectious disease outbreaks. They have the authority to order corrections within a specified period for any non-compliant areas and to impose administrative penalties on those who violate the "Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases."

	Infectious diseases are a diverse group of illnesses caused by various pathogenic microorganisms, characterized by their infectious nature, tendency to spread, and recurrence. These diseases pose a significant threat to human health. Statistics show that the number of people currently suffering from infectious diseases in the country exceeds 100 million.

	Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has vigorously carried out work to prevent and treat infectious diseases. In recent years, this work has been further strengthened, and the total number of cases has gradually decreased each year. In 1980, the number of cases for 25 types of infectious diseases in China was 20.31 million, which decreased to 5.02 million by 1988.

	The "Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases," which will begin to be implemented in September, is the first comprehensive law on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases since the founding of the People's Republic. Officials say that to ensure the effectiveness of the regulations, it is necessary to implement the supervision and management of the law and establish a team of high-quality supervisors.

	It is reported that the work of appointing infectious disease management supervisors in various places has begun in succession. The appointed infectious disease management supervisors will be issued certificates by the health administrative departments at the provincial level and above.

    各地建监管队伍预防传染病流行
    新华社北京8月7日电　（实习生温闽、记者于长洪）我国将聘任一批传染病管理监督员，以建立健全传染病管理监督体制。
    记者从卫生部获悉：从卫生行政部门和各级各类卫生防疫机构中聘任的传染病管理监督员，将严格执行9月1日起实施的《传染病防治法》，对传染病的预防、治疗、监测、控制和疫情管理措施进行监督检查，对不符合要求的地方有权责令其限期改进，并对违反《传染病防治法》的人给予行政处罚。
    传染病是由多种病原微生物引起的种类繁多的一群疾病，具有传染性、流行性、反复性等特点，严重危害人体健康。据统计，全国现患传染病的病人数在1亿以上。
    建国后，我国大力开展传染病防治工作。近年来，这项工作得到进一步加强，总发病数逐年有所下降。1980年我国25种传染病发病数为2031万人，到1988年下降为502万人。
    已定于9月份开始施行的《传染病防治法》是建国以来第一部全面针对传染病防治管理工作的卫生大法。有关人士称，要使法定的规范起到实效，还必须落实法的监督管理工作，建立一支素质较高的监督员队伍。
    据悉，各地聘任传染病管理监督员的工作已陆续开始，受到聘任的传染病管理监督员由省级以上政府卫生行政部门发给证件。
