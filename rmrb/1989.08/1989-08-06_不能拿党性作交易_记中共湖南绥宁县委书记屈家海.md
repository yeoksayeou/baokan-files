Recently, at the meeting held by the Communist Party of China's Hunan Provincial Committee to commend advanced grassroots party organizations, outstanding Communist Party members, and party cadres, the story of Xu Jiāhǎi, the secretary of the Suining County Committee, who strictly disciplines himself, serves the public with integrity, and promotes the entire leadership team's anti-corruption efforts through his actions, spread throughout the venue.

Whenever Xu Jiāhǎi goes to the countryside, he never calls ahead to notify anyone. He does not smoke or drink, and insists on eating, living, and discussing matters with local officials and the masses. Sometimes, if the canteen adds a few dishes, he insists on paying for them. Over time, this became a rule, and wherever he goes, people are very warm and do not treat him as a guest.

Last year, when his eldest child got married, he wanted to buy a color TV. He called the finance and planning commission officials in advance, telling them not to issue a voucher for his child. In the end, the color TV used for his child's wedding was still purchased at a negotiated price from another province.

His wife was sent down from Changsha to Suining in 1958 and has been teaching at the county's forestry children's school ever since. The school is two kilometers away from the county committee office. Well-meaning people advised him to transfer his wife to a closer location or even into the office, but he always just smiled and shook his head.

He has two elder brothers and two elder sisters in his hometown of Liuyang. His nephews and nieces are all in the countryside. They all wanted to find jobs in the county through his connections, but he did not seek any personal benefits beyond policy.

Suining is one of the four major forestry counties in Hunan Province. Friends have repeatedly suggested that he help them buy some timber, but he has never opened his mouth to do so. When his cousin built a house and needed timber, he did not agree. He also politely declined his in-laws, who are Christians, when they wanted to buy a coffin. A friend from the same year of work had a daughter getting married and needed furniture, but he did not agree to that either. As a result, he did offend some relatives and friends.

Xu Jiāhǎi always reminds himself to remember the glorious mission of a Communist Party member and to build an iron wall in his mind to resist corruption.

In recent years, to revitalize the county's economy, he and other leaders have introduced $1.55 million in foreign exchange and helped some enterprises solve raw material difficulties and promote products, doing a lot of beneficial work. Some enterprises, according to their own rules, wanted to give him and other leaders some "service fees" and "credibility fees," but he and the other leaders did not agree.

Xu Jiāhǎi always consciously opposes and resists the trend of accepting free meals and gifts. He has an unspoken rule for himself: for any business meetings, negotiation meetings, or annual meetings held by grassroots units, he insists on not attending if invited to eat, not accepting souvenirs, and not accepting gifts. At the end of last year, an enterprise held a celebration for its completion and operation, and after the meeting, a banquet was arranged and generous souvenirs were given to the attendees. Several times they invited him, but he declined each time. Later, someone sent him a souvenir, but he immediately returned it.

Xu Jiāhǎi not only strictly requires himself to be upright but also pays attention to leading a team of people to serve the public with integrity.

In the spring of 1986, when he served as the deputy secretary of the county committee and took charge of the county committee's work, he reiterated the county committee's past requirements for rectifying party style and put forward some new opinions, which were issued as the county committee's No. 1 document for that year to all grassroots party organizations in the county. This document, like a spring breeze, deeply impressed the hearts of all county officials. Later, on this basis, it was continuously revised and supplemented, forming the "Eight Regulations," "Seven Measures," and "Fifteen No's," which became the behavioral norms for officials to serve the public with integrity.

With the establishment of the system, he emphasized implementation. He successively announced to the county construction bureau and the land and resources bureau that land for private housing construction could not be approved for officials. Then, he repeatedly reported to the municipal and provincial discipline inspection leaders, requesting a clear ban on officials building private houses. At the same time, he insisted on doing detailed ideological and political work. Once, he heard that a county committee standing committee member had also approved land for house construction and bought timber, so he went to the committee member's home to have a heart-to-heart talk, persuading him and inspiring him to hope that he would set a good example. This committee member finally gave up the idea of building a private house.

Because the main leaders' attitudes were clear and their measures were decisive, out of 40 county-level officials, not a single one built a private house in the past few years, although some comrades' housing did not meet the standard.

In promoting the anti-corruption efforts of the leadership team, he also emphasized the role of the county-level "several families" in group functions. He insisted on holding a democratic life meeting every quarter, concentrating on learning, exchanging ideas, and asking everyone to "point out problems" and strengthen supervision. In this way, the self-awareness of county-level officials to serve the public with integrity has been continuously improved, and they generally maintain a rigorous lifestyle and high moral character. In recent years, the leaders of the county-level "several families" have all been able to maintain a clean and upright style. Among the 40 county-level leaders, there are still 7 comrades whose spouses have not been arranged for work.

    不能拿党性作交易
    ——记中共湖南绥宁县委书记屈家海
    李仲恒　邹旭阳　刘运益　王汉雄
    前不久，在中共湖南省委举行的表彰先进基层党组织、优秀共产党员和党务工作者大会上，中共绥宁县委书记屈家海严于律己、廉洁奉公，用实际行动推动整个班子廉政建设的事迹，传遍了会场内外。
    屈家海每次下乡，从不事先打电话通知，烟酒不沾，坚持同当地干部群众同吃同住同商量。有时食堂加几个菜，他都坚持付钱。这样时间一久，就成了规矩，他走到哪里，哪里都很亲热，不把他当客人招待。
    去年他大孩子结婚，想买彩电。他事先给财委、计委负责人打招呼，不许给孩子批条子。结果，孩子结婚用的彩电，还是到外地议价买来的。
    他爱人是1958年从长沙下放绥宁的，在县林业子弟学校任教至今。学校到县委机关往返有两公里，好心人劝他将爱人调近些或干脆调进机关，他总是微笑着摇摇头了事。
    他在浏阳老家有两个哥哥和两个姐姐，侄儿、外甥都在农村。侄儿、外甥们很想通过他的关系到县城里找份工作，他没有为亲友谋求政策以外的任何私利。
    绥宁是湖南省四大林区县之一，亲友多次提出要他帮助买点木材，他没开过一次口子。堂哥盖房子要买木材他也没答应，信奉基督教的岳父母要置办棺木他婉言拒绝，有一位同时参加工作的老朋友的女儿结婚要置家具，他同样没有答应。为此，确也得罪了一些亲戚朋友。
    屈家海同志时时告诫自己，要牢记共产党人的光荣使命，从思想上筑起抵制腐蚀的铁壁铜墙。
    近几年，为了搞活县里的经济，他和其他领导成员一道，引进外汇155万美元，还帮助一些企业解决原材料困难，推销产品，做了大量有益的工作。有些企业按照自订的规矩，要给他和其他领导一些“服务费”、“信誉费”。他和其他领导均未同意。
    对白吃、白拿之风，屈家海总是自觉反对和抵制。他给自己立了一条不成文的规矩：凡基层单位召开经营业务会，洽谈会或各种年会等，坚持请吃不去，纪念品不要，送礼不收。去年底，一个企业建成投产，召开庆祝会，会后安排了宴请并发给与会者丰厚的纪念品。几次请他，均婉言谢绝。事后托人送来一份纪念品，他又当即退了回去。
    屈家海不仅从严要求自己如玉，还注意带领一班人廉洁奉公。
    1986年春，他担任县委副书记主持县委工作时，重申了县委过去对端正党风的一些要求，并提出了一些新的意见，作为当年县委的1号文件发到全县基层党组织。这个文件像一股春风，深深地印在全县干部的心里。以后又在这个基础上，不断进行修改补充，形成为“八条规定”、“七条措施”、“十五个不准”，成为干部清廉从政的行为规范。
    有了制度，就要抓落实。他先后对县城建局和国土局宣布，不能给营建私房的干部批土地。接着，又向市和省纪委领导多次反映，要求明令禁止干部营建私房。与此同时，又坚持做过细的思想政治工作。有一次，他听说一位县委常委也批了建房土地，买了木料，就登门找这位常委谈心，说服他，启发他，希望他带个好头，这位常委终于放弃了建私房的打算。
    由于主要领导态度鲜明，措施果断，40名县级干部中几年来没有一个营建私房的，尽管部分同志住房远没有达到标准。
    在抓一班人的廉政建设中，他还特别强调发挥县级“几大家”的群体功能。坚持每个季度一次民主生活会，集中学习，交换思想，并请大家“挑刺”，加强监督。这样，全体县级干部清廉为政的自觉性不断提高，普遍都能保持严谨的生活作风和高尚的道德情操。这些年来，县级“几大家”的领导干部都能保持廉洁清正的作风。40名县级领导中，至今尚有7位同志的爱人没有安排工作。
