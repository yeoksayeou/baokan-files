The creation of Malaxiangfu's novel "Vast Grasslands" (in two parts) is quite peculiar. The first part was completed in 1956, and upon its publication, it received widespread acclaim and awards. At that time, the author was in his prime, full of vigor. In the autumn of 1959, he completed the second part. Unfortunately, during the year when class struggle was emphasized, the first part, which had already won an award, was criticized, and the second part was not published. The current printed version is not the author's original manuscript; the original manuscript was destroyed in that well-known disaster. Thirty years later, we are finally fortunate to read the complete work of "Vast Grasslands" in two parts.

"Vast Grasslands" unfolds with a vast canvas and a grand momentum, depicting the sharp and complex struggles on the grasslands of Chahar during the War of Liberation, as well as the intertwined behaviors and fates of various characters in these struggles. The work presents a highly tense and complex ecological environment: there are battlefields where two armies clash with weapons drawn; there is the identification and trial of wolves like Gongge'er and Wangdan who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks; within the party, there is the identification and struggle against ultra-leftist distortions of the party's ethnic policies; outside the party, there is the education, persuasion, and winning over of upper-class Mongolian figures like Damu'ting and Wacier; there are trials by fire and iron bars, there is the arduous work of turning enemies into friends, and there is a psychological battlefield broader than the sky and deeper than the ocean.

Compared to the first part of "Vast Grasslands," the second part attempts to break free from a relatively narrow and single-minded thinking space, moving towards a literary transformation that is rich in contemporary consciousness, multi-dimensional vision, and multi-value functions. This transformation in literary concepts is reflected in the portrayal of characters. In this novel, there are dozens of characters from the enemy, self, and friend camps, and the author has accurately grasped the real interpersonal relationships, personalities, and fates of people in the context of two camps facing off. The images of the party leaders Luobusan and Suring are written through sharp and complex environments. The rigid and serious military life has not hindered their two rich hearts; Suring is steady and reserved, possessing the keen insight of a female politician, while Luobusan is dignified and rugged, upright and outspoken. Through the thick layers of historical clouds, Malaxiangfu goes beyond the general construction of the souls and images of soldiers, fully depicting their sacred sense of responsibility and mission. This emotional arousal comes from a deep concern for the fate of their own nation's history, and the work also gives full play to the moral integrity of these two soldiers.

It is worth mentioning that the images of the young Mongolian revolutionaries Xiqin, Tiemu'er, and Shaketi, who have grown up in a sharp and complex struggle environment, are quite successful. The author tightly focuses on the different fates of these three different characters, making one feel the surging of magnificent life. In the second part of "Vast Grasslands," Xiqin, a Mongolian girl who has suffered cruel class oppression and been humiliated and harmed by Gongge'er, has already taken on the heroic posture of a revolutionary soldier. Her heroic qualities are dissolved like scattered gold and jade in the river of life. This respect and cherishing of the heroic qualities hidden in countless ordinary people is the author's new breakthrough. Tiemu'er, after undergoing the trial of iron bars and fire, still has personal heroism and narrow nationalist sentiments that occasionally recur. Tiemu'er quickly realized his mistake and played a crucial role in the planning of the Hatou mutiny. This highly self-aware revolutionary heroism not only contains the heroic nature of life itself but also aligns with the direction of history, becoming a driving force for historical progress. Different from Tiemu'er's situation, the author gives Shaketi, a son adopted by a herdsman, another scenario. His rich soul rejects the pain brought by fate and grows freely. His life is full of vitality in the revolutionary ranks.

The novel has made a multi-faceted exploration of the internal roots of heroes. The national psychological qualities of the Mongolian people in a specific historical period are fully expressed. History has created the Mongolian people and shaped their spiritual and cultural psychology. The national qualities of the Mongolian people are often summarized as simplicity, openness, and frankness. Their spirit of progress and pursuit of idealism is often overlooked. In fact, this nation, which occupies a vast territory but has a small population and has experienced many hardships, has a tenacious vitality precisely because of their tenacious pursuit of ideals. This is the spiritual pillar that the Mongolian people rely on for survival and development. I believe that Malaxiangfu's grasp and vivid depiction of this characteristic of his own nation is his new contribution to literary creation.

While depicting the confrontation between two armies, the author opens up another dimension—the psychological, moral, and human dimension. The heart-rending reunion and heart-wrenching separation of Tiemu'er and Xiqin, the moral and rational parting of Shaketi and Laibo'erma that makes one deeply shiver, and the emotional and spiritual fusion and reunion, as well as the soul's call that drives them to transcend the constraints of discipline or yield to the control of fate, are all expressed without any concealment. The protagonists' life choices, ideals, life feelings, inner experiences, and personal integrity are all deeply moving. The author has understood the true and complex psychological processes of the characters in the novel. The author has not avoided human hearts, emotions, and nature, but has also properly placed their time and space positions. "Vast Grasslands" is a symphony of fate burning with passion.

    激越的命运交响曲
    ——评《茫茫的草原》
    邢莉（蒙古族）
    玛拉沁夫的长篇小说《茫茫的草原》（上、下部）创作历程是十分奇特的。上部完稿于1956年，书一问世，便受到好评，并获奖。当时作者风华正茂，血气方刚，1959年秋，便将下部完稿。适逢“阶级斗争为纲”之年，已经获奖的上部受到批判，下部未能出版，现今的印本已不是作者的原稿，原稿已毁于那场众所周知的罹难。时隔30年后的今天，我们终于有幸读到《茫茫的草原》上、下两部的全书。
    《茫茫的草原》以开阔的画面和磅礴的气势展开了解放战争时期察哈尔草原上尖锐、复杂的斗争以及在斗争中互相交杂的各种人物的行为与命运。作品展示了一个高度紧张复杂的生态环境：这里有两军对垒兵刃相交的战场；有对钻入革命阵营内部的豺狼——贡郭尔和旺丹等人的识别与审判；在党内有对歪曲党的民族政策的极左主张的识别与斗争；在党外有对达木汀、瓦其尔等蒙古族上层人士的教育、感化与争取；有铁窗烈火的考验，有化敌为友的艰苦工作，还有比天空更广阔、比海洋更深邃的人物的心理战场。
    与《茫茫的草原》上部相比，在下部作者力图从那种比较狭小、比较单一的思维空间下解脱出来，向着富于当代意识的、多维视野的、多价值功能的文学嬗变。这种文学观念的嬗变体现在人物形象的塑造上。在这长篇里，敌、我、友三方的人物多达三四十人，作者较为准确地把握了两营对垒中现实的人际关系、人的性格和命运。党的领导者洛卜桑和苏荣的形象就是通过尖锐复杂的环境中写出来的。刻板一律、紧张严肃的军旅生涯并没有阻碍他们两颗丰富的心灵，苏荣稳重含蓄，具有女政治家的敏锐的洞察力，洛卜桑矜持而粗犷，刚正而直言。玛拉沁夫透过厚厚的历史云层，超越一般意义上的对军人形象和灵魂的构建，而尽情描绘了他们的神圣的责任感和使命感，而这种情感的激发，源于对自己民族历史命运的极大关注，同时作品对这两位军人的道德襟怀也予以酣畅淋漓的张扬。
    值得提出的是，在尖锐复杂的斗争环境中成长起来的蒙古族青年革命者斯琴、铁木尔、沙克蒂尔的形象是颇为成功的。作者紧紧扣住这三个不同人物的不同命运，使人感受到壮丽生命的涌动。在《茫茫的草原》的下部，斯琴这个遭受过残酷的阶级压迫，又被贡郭尔侮辱与损害过的蒙古族的善良少女，已经具有了革命军人的雄姿健影。她的英雄气质如散金碎玉般地溶解在生活的长河中，这种对蕴藏在千千万万的普通人身上的英雄素质的尊重和珍视，正是作者的新开拓。铁木尔经历了铁窗烈火的考验，但他身上存在的个人英雄主义和狭隘的民族情绪也时有反复。铁木尔很快地意识到自己的错误，并在策划哈吐倒戈起义中立下了功劳。这种高度自觉的革命英雄主义不仅仅包容着生命本体的英雄性，而且与历史的走向相吻合，化为推动历史前进的动力。与铁木尔的情境不同，作者赋予沙克蒂尔这个过继给牧主的儿子以另一种情境。他的丰富的心灵摒弃了命运给他带来的痛苦而自由生长。他的生命在革命的队伍里充盈着活力。
    小说对英雄内在根源的理解做了多方面的开掘。蒙古民族在特定的历史阶段中的民族心理素质得到淋漓尽致地表现。历史创造了蒙古民族，造就了蒙古民族的精神文化心理。蒙古民族的民族素质时往往被概括为朴讷、坦荡、开朗，他们奋进向上的精神和理想主义的追求，往往被忽视。实际上，这个占有广阔的地域而人数不多又历经磨难的民族之所以具有顽强的生命力，正是因为他们对理想的韧性的追求。这是蒙古民族赖以生存、发展的精神支柱。我以为，玛拉沁夫对自己民族的这一特性的把握和淋漓酣畅的描绘，是他对文学创作的新贡献。
    作者在描绘两军对垒的同时，开辟出另一层面——心理的、道德的和人性的层面。铁木尔与斯琴铭心刻骨的欢聚和撕肝裂胆的分离，沙克蒂尔与莱波尔玛道德的、理智的那令人深深颤栗的分手与感情的、心灵的融洽与团圆，还有那驱使他们越过纪律的约束或听任命运支配的灵魂的呼叫。都毫不掩饰地表现出来。主人公们的人生抉择、理想志趣、生命感觉、内心体验，人格操守等都表现得深沉动人。作者领悟了小说中人物真实而又复杂的心理历程，作者没有回避人心、人情、人性，但又摆好了他们的时空位置。《茫茫的草原》是一部燃烧着激情的命运交响曲。
