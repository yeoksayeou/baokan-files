Shanghai has completed a major project during the Seventh Five-Year Plan: the Jujiamen Coal Wharf at Shanghai Port. The wharf has recently passed the completion inspection and started operations. This will play an important role in alleviating the tight coal supply situation in Shanghai and the eastern region of China.

The Jujiamen Coal Wharf is located on the eastern bank of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, 14 kilometers away from Wusongkou. The wharf has a shoreline of approximately 302 meters, an average water depth of 10 meters, and covers an area of 11 hectares. Its annual handling capacity is 3.9 million tons, including 2 million tons for unloading coal and 1.9 million tons for loading coal. The wharf is equipped with a 25,000-ton berth and a 1,000-ton berth, as well as large-scale machinery, coal storage facilities, and other supporting infrastructure. The wharf employs advanced technology, including closed-loop bucket elevators, conveyor belts, and walkways for loading and unloading. The production management is automated using electronic computers. The wharf's ability to prevent coal dust pollution meets international advanced standards.
