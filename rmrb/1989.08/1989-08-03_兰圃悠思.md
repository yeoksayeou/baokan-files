	Meditations in the Orchid Garden
	Yan Yan

	Having lived in the bustling city for so long, I was taken aback when I first stepped into this place. I couldn't quite believe or accept that this was the same world. For a moment, I was at a loss, unsure of where I had ended up. The first thing that struck me was the thick, dense, and lush green all around. It covered the ground and reached up to the sky, layer upon layer, creating a hazy, intoxicating, and bewildering scene in this 50,000-square-meter garden. The towering banana trees with their dense foliage blocked out the sunlight; the tall, straight bamboo shoots swayed in the air, rolling out one golden fairy tale after another. The shorter, sturdier plants included members of the jasmine family like the jasmine itself, and the orchid family like the laughing orchid, along with many other rare and precious flowers whose names I couldn't recall. Each step revealed a new scene, a new wonder, a new place to linger and lose track of time, making one wonder if the world was originally green.

	Is green the theme of the orchid garden? No.

	The orchid garden is named for the cultivation of nearly a hundred varieties and tens of thousands of potted orchids. Therefore, the main attraction of the orchid garden is the orchids. When the garden is in full bloom, the air is filled with a faint, sweet fragrance, a subtle charm, and an ethereal grace. Many rare specimens that are not seen in the north, such as Silver-edged Dagon, Large Phoenix Tail, Silver-edged Bodhi, and Five Octopus Dagon, will surely delight and expand your horizons. The flowers are vibrant yet elegant, charming yet not vulgar—this is not just my opinion.

	Under the shelter of the tall, dense greenery, I walked along the winding, tree-lined path, feeling as if I had stumbled into Tao Yuanming's peach blossom spring. Beneath the lush greenery, entwined with vines, were rugged rocks, cascading waterfalls, babbling springs, and red goldfish swimming in the green water. There were also neatly arranged bamboo gates leading to a garden within a garden.

	This garden within a garden is the Fragrant Garden, which won the International Garden Award in Munich, West Germany. It truly showcases the skill of artisans who have outdone nature, condensing the scenic beauty of the southern region into a small garden. The southern charm is embodied here, the southern soil is piled up here, and the southern dialect echoes here. To experience the south, a visit to the Fragrant Garden is enough.

	Curious, I walked up to a very tall tree with leaves as large as banana fans, known as the Big-flowered Dillenia. I picked up one of its fruits, thinking it would be a juicy, sweet peach. But it wasn't. It was just layer upon layer of tightly wrapped flower buds.

	Who would have thought that Guangzhou, with its Five Rams Statue and the bustling China Import and Export Fair Complex, could hide such tranquility, such elegance, and such charm?

	To visit Guangzhou and not see the orchid garden would be a missed opportunity, I believe.

    兰圃悠思
    严妍
    在杂遝的闹市居住惯了，刚一跨进这门槛，真有点不敢承认这里，不敢接受这里。一时我也闹不明白，究竟闯到了哪番天地。迎面扑来的是厚厚的、浓浓的、密密的深绿，下铺地，上连天，层层叠叠，使这五万平方米的园子，顿生一片朦胧醉人而迷离的幻景。那密匝匝枝繁叶盛的耸天的芭蕉树，硕大的叶子把阳光都挡到了天外；一根紧挨一根的直挺秀竹，尖叶在空气中扭动着，翻滚出一个又一个的金色童话。那相比之下个头矮些，却墩墩实实的是一株株属于茉莉科的宝巾、兰花科的含笑，还有许多我叫不上名来的名花珍品。一步一个景致，一步一个奇观，一步一个流连忘返，真让人怀疑世界原本就是绿色的。
    绿色，是兰圃的主题吗？不。
    兰圃是因栽培上百个品种，近万盆兰花而得名。所以，逛兰圃主要赏兰花。当满园兰花盛开的时候，弥腾着一缕缕淡淡的清香，幽幽的怡韵，飘逸的神采。很多在北方不曾见到的珍品，如银边大贡、大凤尾、银边菩提素、五鱿大贡等，更会使你大饱眼福，大开眼界。花艳气高雅，花俏志不俗，这不会是我一个人的见解。
    在高大的浓绿庇护下，我沿着那曲折的林荫小径，真以为误入了陶渊明的世外桃园，苍翠氤氲之下，藤萝缠绕之中，是嶙峋的山石，飞泻的瀑布，潺潺的泉水，还有那红色的金鱼浮于绿水上，编排整齐的竹门拱托着一座园中园。
    这座园中园就是曾经获西德慕尼黑国际庭院式园林大奖的芳华园。真可谓能工巧匠夺了天工妙手，将风光旖旎的南国风景缩成一个小小的园林。南国的风情体现在这里，南国的乡土堆积在这里，南国的语音萦绕在这里。要体会南国，逛一个芳华园就足够了。
    我好奇地走到一棵很高、叶子有芭蕉扇一般大小、名叫大花第伦桃的树前，俯身捡起一颗它的果实，以为桃子一定是淌着奶白色的甜汁，有着厚厚的肉体，其实不然，这只是一层一层紧裹着的花蕾。
    谁能想到，以五羊群塑为标志，以商品交易会大厦为特征的喧闹的沸腾的广州市，居然偷生出这般悠静，这般雅致，这番情趣。
    到广州不游兰圃，乃为憾事，我这样认为。
