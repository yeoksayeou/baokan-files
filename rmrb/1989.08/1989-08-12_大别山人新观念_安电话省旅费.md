		Recently, reporters visited Shancheng in Ludian County, located in the heart of the Dabie Mountains in Hubei Province, and discovered a peculiar phenomenon: the telephone directory issued by the postal and telecommunications department lists private telephone numbers as half of the total.

		According to the county postal and telecommunications bureau, the people of the Dabie Mountains now have a new concept—installing telephones can save travel expenses. The small town of Shancheng has a total of 972 telephones, of which 470 are private residential telephones. Currently, the postal and telecommunications bureau has received over 200 applications for the installation of private telephones, with people coming to inquire every day.

		With the reform and opening up and the development of the commodity economy, the once closed and impoverished people of the Dabie Mountains have also opened their doors to the world, both domestically and internationally. Therefore, the demand for private residential telephones has emerged.

		County Party Secretary Yan Haiyun expressed strong support, saying that using telephone communication not only saves various travel expenses for those on business trips but also ensures faster delivery and earlier information.

		It is understood that the postal and telecommunications department here offers preferential policies for private installation of residential telephones, waiving the initial installation fee. The cost of installing one telephone is around 700 to 800 yuan, which is affordable for most users.

    大别山人新观念——
    安电话省旅费
    据新华社武汉8月12日电　（记者方政军、通讯员胡召平）记者最近在地处大别山腹地的湖北省罗田县山城采访，发现一个奇特的现象：邮电部门印发的电话号码簿上，私人电话号码竟占了一半。
    据县邮电局介绍，大别山人现在有了新观念——安电话可以节省差旅费。小小罗田山城电话机总数有972门，其中私人住宅电话达470门。目前，邮电局又收到要求安装私人电话的申请200多份，天天有人上门来催问。
    随着改革开放和商品经济的发展，一向封闭贫困的大别山人也打开了山门，走向国内外。因此，私人住宅电话热应运而生。
    县委书记晏海云表示积极支持，他说，利用电话通讯不仅节省出差人员的各种旅差费，而且时效快，信息早。
    据了解，这里的邮电部门对私人安装住宅电话者采取优惠政策，一律免收初装费，装一部电话需七八百元左右，一般用户都安得起。
