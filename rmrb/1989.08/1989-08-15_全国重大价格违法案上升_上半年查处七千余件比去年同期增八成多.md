According to materials provided by the Price Inspection Department of the State Price Bureau, in the first half of this year, various levels of price inspection agencies across the country investigated and handled a total of 363,009 cases of price law violations and related incidents. They seized illegal gains amounting to 487.3479 million yuan, of which 414.1729 million yuan has been confiscated, and imposed fines totaling 21.8654 million yuan. Among these, the number of major cases has significantly increased, with 7,165 cases, an 87.6% increase compared to the same period last year.

It is understood that major cases of price law violations in industrial and commercial enterprises, material supply and marketing enterprises, and wholesale commercial enterprises totaled 5,537 cases, with illegal gains amounting to 314.451 million yuan. These figures account for 77.3% of the total number of major cases handled and 77.1% of the total illegal gains, respectively. Some units have creatively established non-commodity fee items, especially in the medical and health, and transportation sectors, where there has been a surge in illegal fees and price gouging, leading to a rise in major non-commodity violation cases. Additionally, it is known that the violation rates in retail commercial enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households are relatively high, with individual industrial and commercial households accounting for 57.9% of the total number of cases.
