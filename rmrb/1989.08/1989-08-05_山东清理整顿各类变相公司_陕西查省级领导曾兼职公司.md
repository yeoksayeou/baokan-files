Shandong Cleans Up and Rectifies Various Shell Companies

	Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 5th: Reporter Jià Jiànzhōu reported that Shandong Province recently dissolved and merged 40 more provincial-level companies. Vice Governor Mǎ Shìzhōng today said that the cleanup and rectification of various companies, especially those that blur the lines between government and enterprise, has reached a critical stage.

	Shandong Province has already detached or dissolved 867 companies run by party and government organs, accounting for 94%. The provincial government decided that in the next step, some entities that do not call themselves companies but have similar functions, such as management departments, sales departments, and business departments, will also undergo necessary cleanup and rectification. It is required that all localities and departments, especially provincial-level agencies, firmly resist lobbying from various quarters and see the cleanup and rectification of companies through to the end.
