	On the Stage and Beyond
	—My View on the Crisis in Opera
	Yu Jun

	In the past, some people worried about the fate of opera. Recently, there has been a "menopause theory" suggesting that the decline or "crisis" in opera is like a person's transition from middle age to old age, temporarily exhibiting various symptoms. Once self-adjusted or treated, it will quickly return to normal old age. After all, opera is an ancient art form.

	Upon careful consideration, this theory is quite melancholic. It seems that the "menopause theory" in the metaphor is inevitably "lame." While the proponents do not worry about its quick demise, they fear it will not last long. "Menopause" means entering old age, "the setting sun is beautiful, but it is near dusk." The "setting sun theory" is a pessimistic judgment that many people have about the current state of opera.

	I believe the "menopause theory" is not entirely accurate.

	For a specific opera genre, the "menopause theory" is only half correct because many once-popular genres that are famous in opera history have indeed declined. How can you say they will not die out? However, as an art form, opera differs from a living human body. Although it may decline, as long as talented individuals emerge and adapt to the times, there is no inevitability of decline. Different genres within the Chinese opera system have some that remain evergreen, which is the reason. Opera is created by people, and the rise and fall of a genre are actually determined by the emergence of creative talent. We cannot say that the form of any genre is absolutely unable to adapt to the times. The revival of a genre first requires the emergence of talent. The creativity of talent determines the vitality of a genre, and the level of talent determines the quality of a genre. Mastering the laws and cultivating talent can ensure the genre's perpetual existence. Now, more than ever, we need a systematic approach to "producing talent and operas"!

	From the perspective of the overall Chinese opera, it is even more difficult to conclude that opera art will inevitably decline and perish. From ancient times to the present, Chinese opera has been continuously developing and changing. If we regard the overall opera as the human race, then we can compare genres to individuals. Genres can die out like generations of individuals, but the overall opera can continue like the human race. The creation and exploration of each generation ensure the development and progress of the human race; the creation and exploration of each genre ensure the prosperity and flourishing of the overall opera.

	This year is the Year of the Snake. According to legend, the snake is a symbol of eternal life. The snake is reborn through successive molts. Comparing opera to the snake may be more appropriate. Those successive molts are like the continuous renewal of opera or genres, and the shed skins are like some declining genres. So, let's compare the current opera crisis to the snake's "molting period"! Let us see the turning point from the crisis and find the vitality.

	Therefore, opera genres and troupes must focus on "producing talent and operas," striving to cultivate batches of talented individuals, the more the better.

    出人与出戏
    ——我看戏曲危机
    羽军
    以前有人担心戏曲的命运，近来则更是提出一种“更年期”说。意谓戏曲的不景气或“危机”，如人之由壮转老的更年期，暂时出现的种种病象，一经自我调整或医治，便很快转为正常的老人。因为不可否认，戏曲是古老的艺术。
    细细品味，此说颇为悲凉。看来，“更年期”说比喻中难免“跛脚”。论者虽不愁其速死，欲知其难久于人世。“更年”乃更入老年，
  “夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”。“夕阳论”是很多人因戏曲现状而产生的悲观判断。
    我认为“更年期”的说法似是而非。
    就某个具体剧种而论，“更年期”说只对了一小半，因为不少曾经流行一时，名标剧史的剧种的确早已衰亡，你怎能说它不会老死呢？但作为一种艺术形式的戏曲与血肉之躯的活人有所不同，虽然可能衰亡，只要人才辈出，因时而变，就没有衰亡的必然性。中国戏曲体系之内的不同剧种，有的经久不衰，就是这个道理。戏剧是人创造的，剧种的兴衰实际是由创造性人才的兴衰多寡决定的。我们很难说哪个剧种形式本身绝对不能适应时代。剧种的振兴，首先是人才的涌现。人才的创造力决定着剧种的生命力，人才的水平决定着剧种的品位。掌握规律，培养人才，就可以保证剧种生生不息。现在尤需要出人出戏的系统工程！
    从中国戏曲的总体看，更难以作出戏曲艺术必将老朽而衰亡的结论。自古而今，中国戏曲是不断发展变化的。如果我们把戏曲总体看作人类总体，则可把剧种比为个人。剧种可以像一代代个人那样死去，但戏曲总体却像人类总体那样绵延不断。一代代个人的创造和开拓，保证着人类的发展前进；一代代剧种的创造和开拓，保证着戏曲总体的繁荣昌盛。
    今年是蛇年，传说中灵蛇是永恒生命的象征。蛇在一次次蜕变中不断新生。把戏曲比为灵蛇也许更为恰当。那一次次蜕皮正如戏曲或剧种一代代不断更新，那些蜕下的空皮囊恰像某些衰亡的剧种。那么，还是把当前的戏曲危机比作灵蛇的“蜕皮期”吧！让我们从危机中看到转机，找到生机。
    因此，戏曲剧种和团体必须落实到“出人出戏”，努力造就一批批人才，多多益善。
