	Beidaihe has seen a significant reduction in publicly funded tourists this summer, while self-funded tourists have noticeably increased.

	According to the Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on August 9th, since the height of summer this year, the number of publicly funded tourists in Beidaihe has drastically decreased, while the number of self-funded tourists has significantly increased.

	Beidaihe received 50 million tourists last year, with more than half being publicly funded tourists and vacationers. According to Yan Shenglin, the director of the Beidaihe Tourism Bureau, the number of tourists this year has decreased by nearly 10 million. The main reason is that the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a notice to cancel the summer vacation for government agencies and public institutions. However, the number of self-funded tourists has rapidly increased since late July, already surpassing the same period last year.

    北戴河今夏公费游人锐减
    据新华社石家庄8月9日电　今年盛夏以来，北戴河公费游客大量减少，而自费游人显著增多。
    北戴河去年接待游客达500万人次，其中半数以上是公费旅游和休假者。据北戴河旅游局长严升林介绍，今年的游人减少了近100万人，其主要原因是，中共中央、国务院办公厅下达了关于取消机关、事业单位暑期休假的通知。而自费游客自7月下旬以来却迅速增加，已超过去年同期人数。
