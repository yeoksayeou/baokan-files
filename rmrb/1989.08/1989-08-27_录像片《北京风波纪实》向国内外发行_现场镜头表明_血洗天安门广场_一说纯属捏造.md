A documentary that systematically introduces the truth about the political turmoil that occurred in Beijing during the spring and summer of this year—“Beijing Turmoil: The Facts”—will soon be released domestically and internationally.

This documentary, with a wealth of precious on-site footage, takes viewers back to those thrilling days that were crucial to the fate of the Republic. Viewers can see the march of the martial law troops from the east and west through Muzi Di, Fuxingmen, Liujiaqiao, Wangfujing, and Nanchizi towards Tiananmen Square, as well as the entire process of clearing the square. The on-site footage shows that on the early morning of June 4, 1989, students and the masses peacefully withdrew from Tiananmen Square. The claim of a “massacre at Tiananmen Square” is purely fabricated. Viewers can see in this documentary the planners and organizers of the turmoil, including Liu Xiaobo and Wu Bin, who was in charge of the “Tiananmen Square Reception Station.” Liu Xiaobo said that starting from June 2, he and Hou Dejian and three others went to the square to go on a hunger strike. By the early morning of June 4, they were still on the square. He said, “The atmosphere on the square was extremely tense. We four discussed and decided to have the students withdraw peacefully.” They decided that Hou Dejian and two others would go to negotiate with the martial law troops, while Liu Xiaobo would “stay on the square to mobilize the students.” Liu Xiaobo was among the last batch to withdraw from Tiananmen Square at 6:30 AM on June 4. He said, “I did not see the military firing at the students. I did not see any dead bodies myself.” Wu Bin was awakened by the martial law troops while they were checking the tents and was persuaded to leave the square. Wu Bin said, “After I got up, I saw the troops calling for the students to withdraw from the square. I quickly put on a sweater. A soldier came up to me and asked, ‘Do you have anything left behind?’ I picked up my wallet. He asked, ‘Did you leave anything behind?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Hurry up and leave the (People’s Heroes’) Monument.’ So I walked towards the monument. At that time, the students were concentrated in the southeast corner of the square, from where they withdrew. I did not see any bloodshed, let alone anyone being killed.”

This 55-minute documentary, in addition to copies with commentary in Mandarin and Cantonese, also has copies with commentary in English, French, Japanese, German, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and Vietnamese. The documentary was jointly produced by the China Audio-Visual Publishing House, China Huayi Audio-Visual Industry Co., Ltd., and Beijing Audio-Visual Company.

    录像片《北京风波纪实》向国内外发行
    现场镜头表明“血洗天安门广场”一说纯属捏造
    新华社北京8月27日电　记者从有关方面获悉，一部系统地介绍今年春夏之交发生在北京的政治风波真相的录像片——《北京风波纪实》，即将向国内外发行。
    这部录像片以大量珍贵的现场镜头，把观众带回到关系到共和国生死存亡的那些激动人心的日子。人们从片中可以看到戒严部队从东西两个方向，经过木樨地、复兴门、六部口、王府井、南池子等路口向天安门行进的情况，以及天安门广场清场的全过程。现场拍摄的镜头表明，1989年6月4日凌晨，大学生和群众是和平撤离天安门广场的，所谓“血洗天安门广场”的说法纯属捏造。观众从这部录像片中可以看到动乱的策划者、组织者之一刘晓波和“高自联广场接待站负责人”吴斌追述当时天安门广场的情况。刘晓波说，他于6月2日开始同侯德健等四人去广场绝食，到6月4日凌晨他们一直在天安门广场。他说，6月4日凌晨，“广场上气氛特别紧张”，“我们四人临时商量了一下，准备叫同学们和平撤离广场”。他们决定由侯德健等二人去找戒严部队商量，刘晓波则“留在广场做学生的动员工作”。刘晓波是6月4日晨6点30分最后一批撤离天安门广场的。他说：“我没有看见军队向学生开枪。我自己也没有看见死人。”吴斌是戒严部队在清场检查帐篷时，将他叫醒劝他离开广场的。吴斌说：“我起来之后，看到部队开始叫学生撤离广场，当时我赶紧套了一件毛衣。有个部队战士走到我的跟前，把我叫起来，他问我，‘你还有什么东西’，我拿起钱包。他问，‘有没有丢下什么东西’，我说，‘没有’。他说，‘你赶紧离开（人民英雄）纪念碑’。于是我往纪念碑走去。当时学生都集中在广场东南角，从那里撤出。我没有看到流血事件，更不用说打死人了。”
    这部55分钟的录像片，除有用汉语普通话和广东话解说的拷贝外，还有用英、法、日、德、俄、西班牙、阿拉伯、越南8种外语解说的拷贝。这部录像片是由中国录音录像出版总社、中国华艺音像实业有限公司和北京音像公司共同制作的。
