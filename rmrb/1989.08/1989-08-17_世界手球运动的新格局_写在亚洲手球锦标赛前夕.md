In sports where physical contact is frequent and on-court confrontations are intense, it is often the tall and strong who have the advantage. However, handball might be an exception.

This sport, which originated in European stadiums at the end of the 19th century, has long been dominated by European players. However, the situation has begun to change in recent years. Tall and strong European players have suffered consecutive defeats at the hands of rising Asian teams, even to the point of surrendering. In just the past two Olympic Games, Chinese women first broke through in Los Angeles to win a bronze medal, and then the South Korean women's team defeated the old world champion to claim the title, while their men's team finished second, right behind the Soviet Union. The consensus among international handball experts is that the landscape of world handball has shifted from Eastern Europe's dominance to a contest between Eastern Europe and East Asia.

This change in the landscape and reversal of fortunes is not due to the decline of the former hegemons but is the inevitable result of Asian teams developing a unique set of tactics suited to their physical characteristics.

Ever since handball was introduced to Asia in the 1950s, young Chinese players began the arduous task of exploration. To counter the height advantage of their opponents, they did not simply select tall players to compete for control of the airspace. Instead, they focused on speeding up lateral movements, expanding attack points, increasing defensive layers, and fully utilizing their own agility and flexibility. They strove to create winning opportunities in the lower third of the court and developed effective scoring methods such as quick shots. As pioneers of the Asian handball style, the first generation of national team players once led Asia for several years. After handball was revived in China in the 1970s, these veterans, still in their prime, once again dominated the Asian championship.

In recent years, teams from South Korea, Japan, and others have followed suit, not only adopting the "secret weapons" of Chinese players but also developing along the same lines. They have achieved even greater success in challenging the world's top teams, creating a more powerful wave of impact on traditional handball tactics.

Of course, Asian handball has taken a leading role in competitive sports with strong confrontational elements, achieving a position equal to that of European powers in just 30 years. Apart from the correct development direction, another reason is that the rules of handball competition are more stringent. It does not allow for reasonable collisions like those in football and basketball, which to some extent restricts the natural advantages of European players and allows relatively shorter Asian players to fully utilize their agility and flexibility.

In the upcoming Asian Handball Championship, spectators will have the opportunity to appreciate this Asian style, developed through the efforts of millions, which has given European powers a headache. They will also gain a deeper understanding of the true essence of sports competition.

    世界手球运动的新格局
    ——写在亚洲手球锦标赛前夕
    在身体接触频繁、场上对抗激烈的体育竞赛项目中，往往是人高马大者占上风，身强力壮者有优势，但手球也许是个例外。
    这项运动上世纪末发轫于欧洲球场，历来为欧洲选手所垄断。然而，近年来局面却开始改观。身高力大的欧洲选手们在突然崛起的亚洲队伍面前连遭败绩，甚至拱手称臣。仅在近两届奥运会上，便先有中国姑娘在洛杉矶闯关夺隘，一举摘取铜牌；后有南朝鲜女队力克老牌世界冠军，问鼎成功，其男队则排在苏联队之后，坐上亚军交椅。世界手球运动格局业由东欧称雄变为东欧与东亚两方抗衡，已是国际手球界人士的共同看法。
    格局的嬗变，大势的逆转，并非昔日霸主的衰落所致，而是亚洲诸队别开生面，形成了一套适合自己体态特点的战技术的必然结果。
    早在50年代手球运动传入亚洲伊始，年轻的中国选手们便率先开始了这种艰苦的探索。为了对付对手身高的优势，他们不是单纯地挑选大个队员，一味去争场上制空权，而是琢磨加快横向移动的战技术，拓展攻击点，增加防守层，充分发挥自己小巧灵活的特点，努力在下三路创造致胜机会，并创造出诸如快板射门等一系列行之有效的得分手段。作为亚洲手球风格的先行者，第一代国手们曾在亚洲独领风骚，达数年之久。70年代手球运动在中国恢复后，这批老将宝刀不老，又威风凛凛地雄居亚洲冠军之席。
    近年来，南朝鲜、日本等队纷纷起而效仿，不仅全盘学去了中国选手的“秘密武器”，而且沿着同样的思路大加发展，终于在向世界劲旅的挑战中取得了更大的成绩，形成了向传统手球打法更加猛烈的冲击波。
    当然，亚洲手球在对抗性强的项目中先行一步，30年工夫便取得了与欧洲诸强平起平坐的地位，除了发展方向正确外，还有一个原因，那就是手球的竞赛规则更为严格，它不允许有像足球和篮球那样的合理冲撞，在某种程度上使身材相对矮小的亚洲选手得以更充分地发挥自己的敏捷灵巧的特点，而使欧洲选手的天生优势有所制约。
    在即将开始的亚洲手球锦标赛上，观众们将有机会欣赏这种经过千百万人努力所发展起来的、令欧洲诸强大伤脑筋的亚洲风格，同时也可从中领略到深刻的体育竞赛的真谛。
