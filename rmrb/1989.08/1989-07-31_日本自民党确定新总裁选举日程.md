The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan has set the schedule for the election of a new president one week after Prime Minister Uno Sosuke indicated his intention to resign. The party's presidential election management committee today confirmed the timeline for the new presidential election.

The specific schedule is as follows: Announce the election procedures on August 1. Nominate candidates on August 5, and hold a joint press conference. On August 7, candidates will jointly hold a policy speech meeting. On August 8, the Liberal Democratic Party's parliamentary members' meeting will be convened to vote for the new president.

Compared to the election procedures, public opinion is more focused on the candidates. Members of the Diet from the Takeshita faction account for one-quarter of the Liberal Democratic Party's total Diet members, making them the main force in determining the new presidential election. This afternoon, the Takeshita faction officially stated that it will not nominate a presidential candidate, and the Abe faction has made a similar statement. Public attention has shifted to Kawamoto faction's 78-year-old veteran Kawamoto Toshio and the 58-year-old young politician Kiichi Miyazawa. The situation remains unclear, and the final outcome will depend on the intentions of the major factions within the Liberal Democratic Party.

    日本自民党确定新总裁选举日程
    本报东京7月31日电  记者于青报道：日本首相宇野宗佑示意辞职一周后，自民党总裁选举管理委员会今天确定了新总裁选举日程。
    具体时间表是：8月1日宣布选举程序。5日提出候选人，共同举行记者会见。7日候选人共同举行发表政见演说会。8日召开自民党国会议员大会，投票选出新总裁。
    与选举程序相比较，舆论更关注候选人物。竹下派国会议员占自民党国会议员总数的1／4，是左右物色新总裁选举形势的主力。今天下午，竹下派正式表明，该派不推举总裁候选人，加之安倍派也有同样表示，舆论的注意力转向河本派78岁的元老人物河本敏夫和58岁的少壮人物海部俊树。至今形势仍不明朗，判明大势将取决于自民党内主要派系的意向。
