It's amusing, isn't it? The famous line by Li Shangyin, "Heartstrings resonate in unspoken understanding," has been borrowed by Xu Fu, who lived ten centuries earlier, to instruct Emperor Qin! If you hadn't watched that long, detailed television series *The First Emperor*, how could you believe it?

Decades ago, Mr. Hou Baolin humorously mocked "Grandpa Han" for inventing "Guan Yu fighting Qin Qiong." However, I doubt even Mr. Hou could have imagined that today, there would be even more "Grandpa Hans." Not only do they come from ordinary folks, but also from those who dabble in literature.

Of course, "Grandpa Hans" don't read books, so they wouldn't know if Guan Yu could have a chance to fight Qin Qiong. Therefore, we shouldn't blame them too much. But what about the directors and scriptwriters of *The First Emperor*? No matter their level, they should at least know the difference between the Qin and Tang dynasties and not have Qin people reciting Tang poetry, right?

Whether true or false, the more flashy and lively, the better. The plot can be arbitrarily woven, with the emperor often wandering alone in wild waters and mountains, humble dwellings, but avoiding the blow from the prime minister's wife. Language can be arbitrarily used, with ancient, medieval, and modern characters all speaking contemporary Cantonese. Etiquette can be arbitrarily fabricated, with the prime minister and the empress having the chance to be alone together, pulling and tugging. Clothing can be arbitrarily worn, without distinguishing between Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. Objects can be arbitrarily arranged, as if the era of Yao and Shun already had Ge and Ru fine porcelain... In short, once in their hands, the iron-clad history becomes a clay figurine that can be arbitrarily played with. Is this also a kind of artistic creation?

Three years ago, writer Junqing mentioned in a letter about certain historical television programs: "All are in contemporary vocabulary, truly making one laugh and cry. But to make it match history, how difficult! It requires extensive historical knowledge and classical Chinese literacy." These few words can be said to hit the nail on the head.

    秦人吟唐诗有感
    王玉祥
    滑稽不，李商隐的名句“心有灵犀一点通”被比他早十个世纪的徐福借用来说教秦皇！不看那部长长的富有细节描写的电视连续剧《秦始皇》，你怎么肯相信呢？
    早在几十年前，侯宝林先生就幽默地嘲讽过“韩老太爷”发明的“关公战秦琼”。然而恐怕连侯先生当初也未必能料到，如今这“韩老太爷”会愈来愈多。不惟出自引车卖浆之辈，亦复见于舞文弄墨者流。
    当然，“韩老太爷”们不读诗书，对于关公能否有缘与秦琼一战，自是不知，所以对他们亦无须苛责。而《秦始皇》剧编导呢，水平无论如何，总还不至于不晓得秦、唐两代孰先孰后，而让秦人吟唐人之诗吧。
    不管真真假假，怎么花哨怎么热闹就怎么干，情节可以随意编织，万乘之尊每每独来独往于野水荒山，蓬门茅舍，却躲不过宰相夫人当头一棒；语言可以随意使用，远古、中古、近古人物一视同仁，统操时下港白；礼仪可以随意杜撰，丞相与皇妃居然有机会单独在一起拉拉扯扯；服饰可以随意穿戴，不分什么秦汉唐宋元明清；器物可以随意陈设，仿佛尧舜时代就有了哥汝细瓷；……一句话，到了手里，铁脊铮铮的历史顿时成了可以随意捏玩的面人儿。这也算是一种艺术创造？
    三年前，作家峻青先生在一封信中就谈及某些历史电视节目：“全是今人语汇，真令人啼笑皆非。然欲做到与历史吻合，谈何容易，需多方面历史知识及古文素养。”寥寥数语，可算是点到了节骨眼儿上。
