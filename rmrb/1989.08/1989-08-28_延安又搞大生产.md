Yan'an is the birthplace of the major production movement. At that time, to defeat Japanese imperialism and break the economic blockade imposed by the Kuomintang, every mountain and valley in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was ablaze with the fires of land reclamation and farming. The air echoed with stirring songs: "In the liberated areas, hooray! Major production, hooray! Men and women of the border region, all together, hooray! Everyone mobilized, hooray!"

The major production drive of those days enabled the people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to achieve self-sufficiency in food and clothing. Today, the spirit of the major production movement still blows strongly over the loess hills. Those who were once accustomed to wielding old hoes are now operating switches and modern machinery, producing four key products: oil, cigarettes, coal, and wool textiles. From 1970 to 1979, the Yan'an region's industrial sector accumulated losses of 70 million yuan, with a loss of 9.6 million yuan in 1978 alone. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the entire region adjusted its metallurgy, rectified its fertilizer and machinery industries, and vigorously developed energy and light textile industries. It built and renovated 145 enterprises. For example, the Yanchang Oil Field, which has the first oil well on the mainland, produced only a few thousand tons of oil annually in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic. Since 1980, it has developed into a large-scale enterprise group with four oil fields, three refineries, one petroleum machinery factory, two chemical plants, and seven drilling and extraction companies, employing nearly 10,000 workers, producing 200,000 tons of oil annually. The "four key products" have driven the development of the region's industry. By 1988, the total industrial output value reached 535 million yuan, surpassing the total agricultural output value and growing 3.35 times compared to 1978, with taxes and profits increasing 25-fold.

While focusing on grain production, the people of Yan'an are actively developing four major industries: tobacco, fruit, sheep, and potatoes. The Yan'an region has become a national base for flue-cured tobacco, apples, and sheep. Nearly 100,000 farming households have embarked on the path to prosperity. By 1988, the per capita net income of rural residents had increased from 66.8 yuan in 1978 to 303 yuan in the previous year.

The Yan'an spirit is being carried forward, and the Yan'an economy is taking off. It can be foreseen that Yan'an in the 1990s will present an even more splendid appearance.

    延安又搞大生产
    银笙
    延安，是大生产运动的发源地。那时候，为了打败日本帝国主义，粉碎国民党的经济封锁，陕甘宁边区的山山沟沟，到处燃起开荒种地的篝火，回荡着震撼人心的歌曲：“解放区呀么呼嗨，大生产呀么呼嗨，边区的男男女女齐哩哩哩刷啦啦啦索啦啦啦呔，齐动员呀么呼嗨……”
    当年的大生产使延安和陕甘宁边区军民实现了丰衣足食。今天，大生产运动的雄风仍在黄土沟梁上劲吹。那些握惯了老镢头的泥腿子，操纵起电钮和现代化的机器，一下子抛出了石油、卷烟、煤炭、毛纺4个拳头产品。1970年至1979年，延安地区工业累计亏损7000万元，仅1978年就亏损960万元。党的十一届三中全会后，全区调整冶金，整顿化肥、机械，大力发展能源和轻纺工业，建设和改造了145个企业。像拥有大陆第一口油井的延长油矿，建国初期年产石油仅几千吨。从1980年以来，发展为4个油矿、3个炼油厂、1个石油机械厂、2个化工厂、7个钻采公司近万名职工的大型企业联合集团，年产石油20万吨。“四大拳头”带动了全区工业发展，截至1988年，工业总产值达到5.35亿元，超过了农业总产值，较1978年增长3.35倍，税利增长25倍。
    延安人在抓粮食生产的同时，积极开发烟、果、羊、薯4大主导产业。延安地区成了全国的烤烟、苹果、羊子基地……近十万农户走上了脱贫致富之路。截至1988年，农村人均纯收入已由1978年的66.8元增加到去年的303元。
    延安精神正在光大，延安经济正在起飞。可以预料，90年代的延安，将展现更绚丽的姿容。
