The Soviet government, in an official memorandum handed to the Austrian government today, stated that Austria's application to join the European Community is inconsistent with its policy of permanent neutrality.

The memorandum was handed over by the Soviet Ambassador to Austria, Shikin, to Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. The Soviet Union believes that the status of a member of the European Community would deprive Austria of the "practical possibility of implementing a neutral policy," since the European Community is not only an economic community but is also developing into a political union with a unified foreign and security policy.

The Soviet Union also believes that "permanent neutrality is not only Austria's most valuable political asset, but also an important factor for stability, trust, and mutual understanding in all of Europe."

The Austrian government immediately responded to the Soviet Union's statement. Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said that Austria's European Community policy is entirely Austria's own affair, but "as a government, we will never allow people to harbor doubts that Austria will deviate even slightly from its neutral policy."

Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock also stated in a press release from the Foreign Ministry today that he does not consider this memorandum to be a "principled obstacle" to Austria's entry into the European Community.

    苏对奥加入欧共体提出非议
    奥地利总理表示不会偏离中立政策
    新华社维也纳8月10日电  苏联政府在今天递交给奥地利政府的一份正式备忘录中表示，奥地利申请加入欧洲共同体的行动是与其奉行的永久中立政策不相符的。
    这份备忘录是由苏驻奥地利大使希金转交给奥地利总理弗拉瓦茨基的。苏联在备忘录中认为，欧共体成员国的地位将使奥地利失去“实行中立政策的实际可能性”，因为欧共体不仅是个经济共同体，而且还将要发展成为一个具有统一外交和安全政策的政治联盟。
    苏联还认为，“永久中立不仅是奥地利最宝贵的政治财产，而且也是整个欧洲稳定、信任和相互理解的重要因素。”
    奥地利政府对苏联这一表态立刻作出了反应。奥地利总理弗拉瓦茨基说，奥地利的欧共体政策完全是奥自己的事，但“作为政府，我们决不会使人们产生这样的怀疑，即奥地利会丝毫偏离其中立政策。”
    奥地利外长莫克今天也在外交部发表的公报中说，他不认为这份备忘录是奥地利加入欧共体的“原则性障碍”。
