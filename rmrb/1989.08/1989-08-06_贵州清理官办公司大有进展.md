Out of the original 2,047 party and government officials (including retired officials) who held positions in these companies, 1,841 have now been decoupled according to regulations. Guizhou Province has stipulated that the remaining officials must be fully decoupled by the end of August this year. Those who violate the regulations will be subject to disciplinary action.
