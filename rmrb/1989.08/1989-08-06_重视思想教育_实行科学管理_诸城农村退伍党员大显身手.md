Shandong Province's Zoucheng City has strengthened ideological education and management for rural retired soldiers who are party members, emphasizing their leading role in various aspects of rural development. In recent years, 1,860 retired soldiers who are party members have been recognized as advanced figures in various categories in rural areas.

To leverage the role of retired party members in developing rural commodity economies, the city has implemented "three types" of management:

	Standardized archival management. Methods such as archiving by the military affairs department, card registration by the organization department, and registration by the civil affairs bureau are used to meticulously record the age, educational background, technical skills, and performance in the army of retired party members. These records are then categorized and compiled into books, with their work performance and conduct regularly documented.

	Goal-oriented management. Based on the actual abilities of party members, responsibilities, goals, and tasks are assigned at the beginning of each year, with annual inspections, evaluations, summaries, and commendations conducted at the end of the year.

	Socialized guarantee management. Retired party members are given "three priorities": priority in political promotion and employment; priority in production support; and priority in living care and attention.

Over the past four years, 731 party member veterans have taken up positions as village committee members or higher; 704 have become key figures in township and village enterprises; and 610 have become experts in farming, repair, and business. Under their leadership, the city has seen the emergence of 37 specialized processing villages led by retired soldiers, 960 retired soldier cooperatives, and 1,860 specialized households of retired soldiers.

    本报济南电　记者宋学春、王彦田报道：山东省诸城市加强对农村退伍军人党员的思想教育和管理，注意发挥他们在农村各方面的带头作用，近几年已有1860名退伍军人党员被评为农村各类先进人物。
    为了发挥退伍党员在发展农村商品经济中的作用，这个市对他们实行了“三化”管理：
    正规化档案管理。采取武装部建档、组织部立卡、民政局登记等办法，详细记录退伍党员的年龄、文化程度、技术特长和在部队表现等情况，然后分类造册，对其工作实绩和表现定期填写。
    目标化管理。按照党员的实际能力，每年初给他们定责任、定目标、定任务，年底进行检查评比、总结表彰。
    社会化保障管理。对退伍党员采取“三优先”：政治上优先提拔使用；生产上优先扶持；生活上优先关心照顾。
    4年来，这个市已有731名党员复退军人担任了村支部成员以上的职务；有704人成为镇办、村办企业的生产骨干；有610人成为“种养能手”、“维修能手”、“经商能手”。在他们带动下，全市出现37个以退伍军人为主体的专业加工村，960个退伍军人联合体，1860个退伍军人专业户。
