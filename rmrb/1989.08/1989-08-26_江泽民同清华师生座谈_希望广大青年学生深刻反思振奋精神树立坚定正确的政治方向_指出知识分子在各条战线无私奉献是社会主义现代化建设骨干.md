Jiang Zemin Discusses with Tsinghua University Students and Faculty
Hopes Broad Masses of Young Students to Deeply Reflect, Revitalize Spirit, and Establish a Firm and Correct Political Direction
Points Out Intellectuals Selflessly Devoting Themselves on All Fronts Are the Backbone of Socialist Modernization Construction

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 26 (Reporter He Ping) — On August 25, CCP Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin, during a discussion with some students and faculty at Tsinghua University, hoped that all students would revitalize their spirits, raise their awareness through learning, draw lessons, and cultivate themselves into reliable successors of the socialist and communist cause.

Jiang Zemin said, "Youths are the future and hope of the motherland. Our attitude towards you is: both full of enthusiasm and strict requirements."

Not long ago, a student from Tsinghua University wrote a letter to General Secretary Jiang Zemin, hoping that central leaders could come to the university to listen to the thoughts and opinions of the students and faculty. General Secretary Jiang Zemin attached great importance to this and, on the afternoon of August 25, he specially took time out to discuss with Li Tieming, Li Ximing, Chen Xitong, and other comrades at Tsinghua University with the students and faculty.

During the discussion, several undergraduate and graduate students and faculty members from Tsinghua University, including Jiang Feng, Zhu Dequan, Li Luming, Han Qing, Wu Jianping, Li Dongzhou, Luo Bendi, Li Bin, Ju Yiguang, Ni Yixin, Hao Jimin, Li Jun, Miao Shukui, Fang Fang, and Li Yinchun, actively spoke, reporting to the General Secretary their reflections on the recent turmoil and offering their opinions and suggestions on how to improve university work.

In nearly four hours of discussion, General Secretary Jiang Zemin had an open and frank exchange with the students and faculty, and the atmosphere was very lively.

In their speeches, they mentioned that through studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Deng Xiaoping's speeches, as well as relevant documents, and gradually understanding the truth of the event, the broad masses of students and faculty have significantly improved their understanding of this political struggle concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, clarifying many vague understandings. The students and faculty in their speeches believed: through this turmoil, some weaknesses in university students were exposed: they have patriotic enthusiasm but lack a firm and correct political direction; they have democratic aspirations but lack democratic qualities and legal awareness; they have demands for independence but lack a realistic and self-critical attitude; they have great ambitions but lack a spirit of hard work and moral cultivation. In the future, universities must strengthen ideological and political work, allowing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the educational front, and educating the broad masses of students in patriotism, socialism, and communism; helping them establish a correct worldview, improve their theoretical knowledge and ideological awareness, and enhance their ability to distinguish right from wrong, consciously resisting the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization and other decadent thoughts. At the same time, it is necessary to advocate the fine tradition of combining theory with practice and integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers among the broad masses of students.

After listening to everyone's speeches, Jiang Zemin said, "Through this turmoil, not only young students but also each of us should reflect deeply. In recent years, the struggle between the two social systems and the two ideologies has been talked about less; the Party's leadership has been weakened; ideological and political work has been weakened; adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization has not been consistent."

Jiang Zemin reiterated that the Party's policy towards intellectuals remains unchanged. He said, "Socialist modernization construction cannot do without science and technology and education. Intellectuals, as part of the working class, are active in production, scientific research, education, health, news, publishing, literature, and art on all fronts, working selflessly and dedicating themselves, and are the backbone of socialist modernization construction. The broad masses of young students have patriotism and a sense of justice, are full of enthusiasm, and are very sensitive to new things. This is your strength. But at the same time, it should be seen that you also have the weakness of lacking practical training and political experience. Everyone hopes to develop China's economy, but how to do it? First, we must have a stable and united political situation. Once social unrest occurs, everything will be out of the question. I hope that through this turmoil, the broad masses of young students will reflect deeply, learn, draw lessons, continuously improve, establish a political direction of adhering to the Party's leadership and the socialist system, correctly understand our national conditions, understand the development process of the Chinese revolution, especially the modern history of China since the Opium War, strengthen national pride and self-confidence, learn humbly from the broad masses of workers and peasants, temper themselves in the combination of theory and practice, overcome the weakness of being easily arrogant in times of success and easily discouraged in times of setbacks."

Li Tieming and Li Ximing also spoke during the discussion. The secretary of the Tsinghua University Party Committee, Fang Huijian, presided over the discussion.

Before the discussion, Jiang Zemin and other leaders also visited the university-run machinery factory, looking after the students who were practicing in the workshop and the workers who were teaching.

    江泽民同清华师生座谈
    希望广大青年学生深刻反思振奋精神树立坚定正确的政治方向
    指出知识分子在各条战线无私奉献是社会主义现代化建设骨干
    新华社北京8月26日电　（记者何平）中共中央总书记江泽民25日在同清华大学部分师生座谈时，希望广大学生要振奋精神，通过学习，提高认识，吸取教训，把自己培养成为社会主义、共产主义事业的可靠接班人。
    江泽民说，青年人是祖国的未来和希望。对你们，我们的态度是：既满腔热忱，又严格要求。
    不久前，清华大学一位学生曾给江泽民总书记写信，希望中央领导同志能到大学来听取师生们的想法和意见。江泽民总书记对此十分重视，25日下午，他专门抽出时间，同李铁映、李锡铭、陈希同等同志一起，到清华大学同师生们座谈。
    座谈时，清华大学的一些大学本科生、研究生和教师姜峰、朱德权、李路明、韩庆、吴剑平、李东洲、罗本东、李斌、琚贻光、倪以信、郝吉明、李军、苗树柯、方方、李迎春等先后踊跃发言，向总书记汇报他们对这场风波的反思，并对如何改进高校工作等提出了自己的意见和建议。
    在将近4个小时的座谈中，江泽民总书记同师生们坦诚交谈，会场气氛十分活跃。
    他们在发言中谈到，通过学习党的十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志的讲话等有关文件以及对事件真相的逐渐了解，广大师生对这场关系到党和国家生死存亡的政治斗争的认识有了较大提高，澄清了许多模糊认识。师生们在发言中认为：通过这场风波，暴露出了大学生中存在的一些弱点：有爱国热情，但缺乏坚定、正确的政治方向；有民主愿望，但缺乏民主素质和法制观念；有自立要求，但缺乏实事求是和自我解剖；有雄心壮志，但缺乏艰苦奋斗精神和道德修养。今后在高校必须切实加强思想政治工作，让马列主义、毛泽东思想占领教育阵地，对广大学生进行爱国主义、社会主义和共产主义的教育；帮助他们树立正确的人生观，提高理论修养和思想觉悟，增强辨别是非的能力，自觉抵制资产阶级自由化等腐朽思想的侵蚀。同时，还要在广大学生中提倡理论联系实际，与工农兵相结合的优良传统。
    听了大家的发言，江泽民说，经过这场风波，不光青年学生，我们每个人都应该很好地进行一下反思。这些年来，两种社会制度、两种意识形态的斗争讲得少了；党的领导被淡化了；思想政治工作被削弱了；坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化没有一贯到底。
    江泽民重申，党的知识分子政策不变。他说，社会主义现代化建设离不开科学技术和教育。知识分子作为工人阶级一部分，他们活跃在生产、科研、教育、卫生、新闻、出版、文学、艺术等各条战线，忘我工作，无私奉献，是社会主义现代化建设的骨干。广大青年学生有爱国心和正义感，满腔热情，对新事物十分敏感，这是你们的长处。但同时也应当看到，你们身上也存在着缺乏实践锻炼和政治经验的弱点。大家都希望把中国的经济建设搞上去，但怎么搞？首先要有一个安定团结的政治局面。出现社会动乱，一切都无从谈起。希望广大青年学生通过这场风波，深刻反思，通过学习，吸取教训，不断提高，树立坚持党的领导，坚持社会主义制度的政治方向，正确认识我们的国情，了解中国革命的发展历程，特别是自鸦片战争以来的中国近代史，增强民族自尊心和自信心，向广大工农群众虚心学习，在理论与实践的结合中锻炼自己，克服顺利时容易骄傲，遇到挫折容易灰心丧气的弱点。
    李铁映、李锡铭也在座谈时讲了话。清华大学党委书记方惠坚主持座谈会。
    座谈之前，江泽民等领导同志还参观了清华大学校办机械厂，看望了正在车间实习的学生和进行教学的工人师傅。
