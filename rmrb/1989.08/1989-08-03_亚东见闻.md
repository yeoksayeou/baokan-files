	Observations in Yadong
	By Liu Wei, People's Daily Reporter

	The Past and Present of Xia Sima Town

	Opening the map of Tibet, Yadong is located in the narrow strip of land at the southern foot of the Himalayas, bordering Bhutan to the east and Sikkim to the west. The small town of Xia Sima in the valley is the seat of the Yadong County government.

	Xia Sima Town still has several small Western-style buildings, which are historical evidence of British imperialism's invasion of Tibet. In 1904, British troops invaded Tibet and forced the local Tibetan government to sign the unequal "Lhasa Treaty," opening Yadong as a commercial port and establishing a British commercial agency. The Tibetan people bravely fought against the British invaders on numerous occasions.

	Perhaps due to historical and geographical reasons, compared to other towns in Tibet, Xia Sima Town, apart from its unique wooden building style in the forest area, has a vibrant commercial trade. Last year, the per capita income of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen was 380 yuan, but in Xia Sima Town, it reached 1,200 yuan. The town mayor, Cidan, introduced that more than half of the 292 households in the town are engaged in trade, transportation, processing, and catering services. Merchants from Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and other places have opened about 20 shops. Bhutanese border residents also frequently come to Xia Sima in groups to trade freely with the local people. I interviewed a street vendor named Luobu, a Ladakhi who is an overseas Chinese. Luobu said that in 1957, he came to Yadong from Kashmir via India. Now, at over sixty years old, his four children have become Chinese citizens. He said that his small stall alone earns a net income of over 500 yuan per month.

	Border Town Family

	Crossing the wooden bridge over the Yadong River and following the road, one can see some newly built wooden houses. Among them, one stands out with its red and green decorations, and a wooden sign with the Tibetan words "Happy Tea House" hangs on the wooden pillars of the porch. A small shop in front is in business.

	This is the home of retired cadre Zaxi. His two sons work outside, and the four-room apartment upstairs comfortably houses three generations of seven people.

	The living room is furnished with sofas and Tibetan cushions. The Tibetan cabinet decorated with floral patterns holds a television and a tape recorder. The bedroom wall has a Buddha statue, and side-by-side frames contain photos of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai meeting with the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama.

	Zaxi, 59, is a Tibetan from Aba, Sichuan. At 17, he went to Lhasa to worship Buddha and later, with nothing but the clothes on his back, wandered and begged for food until he reached Yadong. Zaxi said that he used to work as a porter for British and Indian merchants. At that time, there were no roads, and he often had to carry heavy goods over snow-capped mountains. In 1959, he started working and married the daughter of a local craftsman, settling down in Yadong.

	The hostess, Ciren Zhuoma, frequently refills our cups with butter tea. She is very talkative. "The family has many children, and in the past, we relied on Zaxi's low wages and a bit of self-cultivated land to make ends meet, which was very difficult. Now, the changes in the family are all thanks to the Party's policies. I cook and make tea every day and also arrange the tasks for the family members. If I just sat around and basked in the sun, I would only live a life of poverty. The car in the family was bought by my son Basang a few years ago with a loan of 7,000 yuan from the bank. He transports firewood and timber to Shigatse and Lhasa and brings back goods. This house was built at the end of last year, costing 200,000 yuan."

	Zaxi pointed to the Tibetan certificate on the wall and introduced that his family was rated as a "millionaire household" in 1986, a "five-good family" in 1987, and a "civilized and wealthy household" for two consecutive years.

	The County Head's Wish

	The county head, Benba Ciren, has the greatest wish to build a medium-sized hydropower station in the near future.

	"Energy is the foundation for economic development. From the perspective of long-term development of Yadong's economy, and also considering the maintenance of ecological balance and the protection of forest resources, it is imperative for Yadong to build a medium-sized power station."

	The rapid Yadong River flows down from the plateau, passing through Xia Sima Town and plunging into the Indian Brahmaputra River, eventually flowing into the Indian Ocean.

	During our interviews, we learned that the county's 250-kilowatt power station is far from meeting the development needs and can only maintain general work and lighting. In the three nights we spent in Yadong, the lights were as dim as candlelight, and the county television station relied on the support of a small power station from the garrison. Due to the shortage of energy, the forest has been severely damaged. Just for fuel, the county government, the masses, and the garrison consume 6,000 truckloads of firewood annually, approximately 20,000 cubic meters.

	County Head Benba introduced that in recent years, Tibet has relaxed its economic policies and implemented a policy of recovery and development. The living standards of the people in Yadong have significantly improved. In 1977, the per capita income was 154 yuan, and by 1988, the county's per capita income reached 759 yuan. Now that the people have money, the forest area has decreased. If we rely on the mountains for short-term gains, in a few years, Yadong will become a barren mountain, and we will have no face to show to future generations of Yadong. Yadong has a forest climate and can develop economic forests. Yadong is only 45 kilometers away from the nearest railway line in India, with good open conditions. The current problem is solving the energy issue.

	This Tibetan county head looked weary. "The Yadong County Government formulated a plan in March 1986 to build a 3,000-kilowatt hydropower station, requiring an investment of 16.5 million yuan, but the funds have not been secured. In August 1987, the county government formulated another plan to build a 1,260-kilowatt hydropower station, submitted to the relevant departments of the Autonomous Region and the Prefecture, but so far, the preliminary expenses have amounted to over 50,000 yuan, and the urgently needed hydropower station for Yadong is still on the drawing board."

    亚东见闻
    本报记者　刘伟
        今昔下司马镇
    翻开西藏地图，亚东就在喜马拉雅山南麓的狭长地带，东邻不丹，西邻锡金。峡谷之中的林区小镇下司马，是亚东县府驻地。
    下司马镇至今还可见数幢西式风格小楼，这也是英帝国主义入侵我西藏的历史证据。1904年英军入侵西藏，强迫西藏地方政府签订不平等的《拉萨条约》，把亚东辟为商埠，并设英商务代理处。西藏人民多次进行英勇的抗英斗争。
    也许是历史和地理环境的原因，下司马镇和西藏其它城镇比较，除其独特的林区木楼建筑特色外，商业贸易在此充满活力。去年西藏农牧民人均收入是380元，在下司马镇，人均高达1200元。镇长次旦介绍，全镇292户居民半数以上从事贸易、运输、加工和饮食服务业，仅从四川、甘肃、青海等地来的商人就开了20来个店铺。不丹的边民三五成群也常来下司马，和当地群众自由贸易。我采访一个摊贩，他叫洛布，是拉达克人，属外籍侨民。洛布说，1957年他从克什米尔经印度来亚东，如今年过花甲，4个儿女已入中国籍。他说仅这个小摊每月净收入500多元。
          边镇一人家
    过了亚东河木桥，沿公路边可看见一些新盖的木楼，其中一幢描红画绿格外醒目，门廊木柱上挂着“幸福茶馆”的藏文木牌。门前新盖的小卖部正在营业。
    这是镇上退休干部扎西的家。他两个儿子工作在外，楼上四居室宽松地住着老少三代7人。
    客厅布置有沙发、藏式卡垫，描有花卉图案的藏柜上摆着电视机、录音机。卧室墙上有佛像，并排的镜框里是毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来会见达赖和班禅的照片。
    59岁的扎西是四川阿坝的藏族，17岁到拉萨朝佛，尔后两手空空，四处流浪讨饭到了亚东。扎西说，他当年给英国和印度商人当背伕，那时没有公路，时常背沉重货物翻越雪山。1959年参加工作后，娶了当地一个手工匠的女儿，在亚东成家立业。
    主妇次仁卓玛不时向我们的杯子里斟酥油茶。她很健谈。“家里孩子多，过去靠扎西低工资和种点自留地维持生活，很困难。现在家里的变化全靠党的政策，我每天做饭打茶，还要安排家里人该做的事。如果光是晒太阳，一辈子都只能过穷日子。家里的汽车，是儿子巴桑前几年从银行贷款7000元买的，拉柴禾、木料去日喀则和拉萨，再拉百货回来。这楼房是去年底盖的，花了2万元。”
    扎西指着墙上的藏文奖状介绍说，他家1986年被评为县万元户，1987年被评为县“五好家庭”，连续两年还被评为“文明富裕户”。
                县长的心愿
    县长边巴次仁最大的心愿是：在近期建一座中型水电站。
    “能源是发展经济的基础，从长远发展亚东经济的角度，同时也考虑到维持生态平衡、保护森林资源，亚东建中型电站势在必行。”
    急湍的亚东河从高原流下，经下司马镇直泻印度拉马普特拉河流入印度洋。
    我们在采访中了解到，县里250瓩电站远不能适应发展的需要，仅能维持一般工作和照明用电。在亚东的三个晚上，电灯昏暗如同烛光，县电视台用电还靠驻军小电站支援。由于能源匮乏，森林遭到极大破坏。仅是燃料用柴，亚东机关、群众、驻军一年就消耗6000卡车，约2万立方米。
    边巴县长介绍，近几年西藏放宽经济政策，实行休养生息，亚东群众生活水平有明显提高。1977年人均收入154元，到1988年，全县人均759元。群众手里有钱了，森林面积也减少了。如果靠山吃山注重眼前效益，不需几年，亚东将变为光秃秃荒山，我们将无颜对亚东后人。亚东是林区气候，可以发展经济林木，亚东距印度最近的铁路线仅45公里，具有良好的开放条件。现在的问题是解决能源。
    这位藏族县长看上去满面倦容。“亚东县政府1986年3月就制订了建3000瓩水电站的计划，需投资1650万元，但资金无从落实。1987年8月，县府又制订了建1260瓩水电站计划，呈报自治区、地区两级有关部门，至今，前期费用花去5万多元，亚东急需的水电站还在图纸上。”
