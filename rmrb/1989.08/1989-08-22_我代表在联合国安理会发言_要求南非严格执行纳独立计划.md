China's Representative at the UN Security Council Speaks, Demanding South Africa Strictly Implement Namibia's Independence Plan

	UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council continued its discussion on the Namibia issue today. Li Luye, China's Permanent Representative to the UN, spoke at the meeting, hoping that the South African authorities would keep their promises, fulfill their obligations, and not take any actions that would disrupt the fairness and freedom of Namibia's elections or any actions that would be detrimental to Namibia's independence on schedule.

	Li Luye listed several instances where the South African authorities had failed to implement Resolution 435 and the independence plan. For example, the "riot control units" that were supposed to be disbanded according to the independence plan have had many of their members incorporated into the "South West African Police," who continue to intimidate and harass the people of Namibia. The command structure of the "South West African Territorial Force," which was supposed to be dismantled, has not been disbanded. Additionally, there have been incidents of non-Namibians registering as voters. He pointed out, "All of these actions are in violation of the Namibia independence plan that all relevant parties have agreed to."

    我代表在联合国安理会发言
    要求南非严格执行纳独立计划
    本报联合国8月21日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天继续审议纳米比亚问题。中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野大使在会上发言，“希望南非当局信守诺言，认真履约，不要采取破坏纳米比亚大选的公正、自由以及一切不利于纳米比亚如期独立的行动。”
    李鹿野列举了南非当局没有履行435号决议和独立计划的行为，如按照独立计划本应解散的“防暴部队”，有不少人被编入“西南非警察”中，并不断对纳米比亚人民进行恫吓和骚扰；本应撤销的“西南非领土军”指挥机构至今也未撤销；此外，还发生了非纳米比亚人作为选民登记的情况。他指出，“所有这些都是违反有关各方已接受的纳米比亚独立计划的”。
