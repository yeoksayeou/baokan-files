A recent sampling inspection by relevant departments in Liaoning Province revealed shocking results. Out of 1,167 businesses inspected, 1,654 products and 2,794 batches were checked, with only 1,233 batches passing the quality test, accounting for just 44.1% of the inspected products. In response to this situation, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to prioritize the crackdown on counterfeit and substandard goods as a key measure to stabilize prices, which has been widely supported by the public.

Since the beginning of this year, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have organized the departments of industry and commerce, technical supervision, and standards metrology to form a quality inspection network. They regularly inspect businesses across the province, identify issues, and address them promptly. The industry and commerce department in Shenyang had doubts about the authenticity of the famous liquor "Wuliangye" sold in the provincial supply and marketing cooperative service building. They requested assistance from the technical supervision bureau and the standards metrology bureau. After chemical analysis and verification, it was found that all the liquor was fake; further investigation at the "Wuliangye" liquor factory confirmed that the invoices were forged. After exposing the truth and dismissing various interferences, they publicly exposed those who intervened and displayed the approval documents on television. Ultimately, they took decisive action: confiscating all illegal gains, imposing a fine of 100,000 yuan, and holding the directly responsible individuals accountable for criminal charges of speculation and profiteering.

They also mobilized the public to report counterfeit and substandard goods. In Fushun, a type of "fresh orange juice" tasted unusual, and the public reported it to the standards metrology bureau. The standards metrology bureau, in cooperation with the industry and commerce bureau, traced the source of the "fresh orange juice" from the store to a clandestine black factory in Xianju County, Zhejiang, operated by a few individuals. According to policy, they shut down the factory and dealt with the individuals involved in a serious manner.

In the crackdown on counterfeit and substandard goods, Liaoning Province not only dealt with the producers of these goods but also seriously handled the distributors. A private enterprise in Jinzhou produced feed with a soil content as high as 71.84%, severely affecting the development of animal husbandry. After the Provincial Technical Supervision Bureau investigated and found the issue, they revoked the business license of the enterprise and ordered it to compensate the customers for their economic losses. At the same time, they seriously dealt with the responsible person of the distributor, Jinxi Feed Company, to enhance their sense of responsibility.

    辽宁稳定物价采取重要措施  严肃检查打击假冒伪劣商品
    本报沈阳8月8日电　记者段心强报道：辽宁省有关部门前不久的一次抽样调查使人大吃一惊。全省抽查1167个经营企业，检查1654种商品、2794个批次，合格的只有1233个，占抽查商品的44.1％。针对这种情况，辽宁省委、省政府决定把打击假冒伪劣商品作为稳定物价的重要措施来抓，受到人们拥护。
    今年以来，辽宁省委、省政府组织工商部门、技术监督部门、标准计量部门合作，形成质量检查网，经常对全省的经营企业进行检查，发现问题，及时处理。沈阳市工商部门对省供销社服务大楼经销的名酒“五粮液”有怀疑，就请技术监督局和标准计量局协助。经过化验、核准，发现这些酒全是假的；到“五粮液”酒厂调查证明，发票是伪造的。水落石出后，他们排除各种干扰，对说情者予以“曝光”，对批的条子通过电视示众，最后对此作了严肃果断的处理：没收全部非法所得，罚款1万元，有关直接负责人被定投机倒把罪，追究刑事责任。
    他们还发动群众举报假冒伪劣商品。抚顺市一种“鲜桔汁”很不对味，群众报告了标准计量局。标准计量局与工商局合作，从经销这种“鲜桔汁”的商店顺藤摸瓜，最后查清，这是由浙江仙居县几个人开办的一家地下黑工厂生产的伪劣饮料。根据政策，他们关闭了这家工厂，并对当事人进行了严肃处理。
    在打击假冒伪劣商品中，辽宁省不仅处理这些商品的生产者，而且严肃处理经销者。锦州市一家私营企业生产饲料，含土量竟高达71.84％，严重影响畜牧业的发展。省技术监督局查清后，吊销了这家企业的营业执照，并令其赔偿顾客的经济损失。同时，对经销者——锦西市饲料公司负责人进行了严肃处理，以提高他们的责任感。
