Title: The Villain Strikes First

On August 15, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in the Panama Canal Zone conducted a military exercise in the center of Panama City to "defend" the U.S. Embassy. Their arrogant and blatant disregard for another country's sovereignty is unprecedented. However, the U.S. Embassy in Panama accused the Panamanian authorities of "actions" that "threaten the safety and operation of American citizens and the canal."

This is a classic case of the villain striking first. The fact is, on August 15, three American soldiers drove a military vehicle into Colón. When they were subjected to a routine check by the Panamanian Defense Forces, they cursed the Panamanian soldiers. After being detained for a few hours, they were released. This was the Panamanian Defense Forces exercising their legitimate authority on their own soil, yet they were accused of "threatening the safety and operation of American citizens and the canal." Clearly, it is the Americans who are showing off their military might in Panama, yet they boldly claim that others are "threatening" their safety. Isn't this the same tactic used during the colonial era?

Since early May, when Panama declared the elections invalid and fell into crisis, the U.S. has increased its troops in the Panama Canal Zone by 2,000 and conducted over 20 military exercises there, invading Panamanian sovereignty more than 100 times in an attempt to force the Panamanian government and people to submit to its hegemony. The U.S. is blatantly violating the canal treaties signed by the two countries and grossly interfering in Panama's internal affairs. Yet, the U.S. Embassy has turned the tables, repeatedly and aggressively accusing the Panamanian government of infringing on "the rights enjoyed by the U.S. under the treaty," and declaring that "necessary exercises" will continue.

Obviously, the U.S. is trying to create a "he said, she said" situation to confuse the world and evade responsibility. However, people's hearts are the scale. In this "trial" between the U.S. and Panama, the only one who should be in the defendant's seat is the American interferer. This tactic of the villain striking first is futile.

    恶人先告状
    8月15日，驻巴拿马运河区的美国海军陆战队在巴拿马首都市中心进行了一场“保卫”美国大使馆的军事演习，其盛气凌人、肆意践踏别国主权的行为实属罕见。然而，美国驻巴拿马大使馆却指责巴拿马当局的“行动”“威胁着美国公民和运河的安全与运营”。
    这完全是恶人先告状。事实是，8月15日有3名美国兵驾驶一辆军车进入科隆，在按规定接受巴拿马国防军检查时，竟破口大骂巴拿马官兵，被巴国防军扣押几个小时后释放。这本来是巴拿马国防军在自己的土地上行使正当权利，反被诬为“威胁着美国公民和运河的安全与运营”，明明是美国在巴拿马耀武扬威，却振振有词地咬定别人“威胁”它的安全。美国人今天在巴拿马奉行的此种行为准则，难道不是殖民时代的故伎重演吗？
    自5月初巴拿马因宣布大选无效陷入危机后，美国向巴拿马运河区增兵2000人，并在那里举行过20多次军事演习，上百次侵犯巴拿马的主权，妄图迫使巴拿马政府和人民屈从于它的强权政治。美国这样做是明目张胆地破坏两国签署的运河条约，粗暴干涉巴拿马内政。可是美国大使馆却倒打一耙，多次气势汹汹地指责巴拿马政府侵犯了“美国在条约规定中享受的权益”，并声称“还要进行必要的演习”。
    显然，美国是想制造一场“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”的官司迷惑世人，逃避罪责。但是，人心是秤。在美巴冲突这场“官司”中，坐在被告席上的只能是美国干涉者，来恶人先告状这一手也是无济于事的。　·立中·
