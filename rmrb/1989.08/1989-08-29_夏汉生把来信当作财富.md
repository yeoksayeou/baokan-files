Xia Han Sheng, the secretary of the municipal committee of our city, has read and handled 720 letters from the public since he took office in July 1987.

In Xia Han Sheng's five notebooks, the key points of the public's letters and the investigation results are recorded clearly. Once there is a result for the issues raised by the public, he will inform the letter writers through various means. For cases that have not yet been resolved, he keeps pressing for updates.

"Letters from the public are a valuable asset. They provide us with information that we cannot obtain in meetings," Xia Han Sheng often says. About one-quarter of the letters are about exposing corruption and decadence among officials. He forwards these to the relevant departments for serious investigation and often follows up on them. A staff member at the municipal letters and visits office said, "Secretary Xia checks the office's work once a month and pays close attention to the issues raised in the letters. For a major economic case involving the municipal road segment, he followed up six times." Under his supervision, seven officials in the city have been disciplined, including being demoted or removed from their posts.

    夏汉生把来信当作财富
    我市市委书记夏汉生，自1987年7月上任以来，阅处、督办群众来信720件。
    在夏汉生的5大册记事本上，群众来信要点、查处情况记录得很清楚；群众反映的事情一旦有了结果，他便通过多种形式，对写信人有所交待；对还没见结果的有关信访案件，他就不断催问。
    “群众来信是笔宝贵财富，它使我们得到了许多会上得不到的东西。”夏汉生经常这样说。来信中约有1／4是检举干部贪污腐化问题，他便批给有关部门认真查处，经常督办。市信访办一工作人员说：“夏书记每月到信访办检查一次工作，对来信反映的问题抓得很紧。市公路段的一个重大经济案件，他就督查了6次。”在他的过问下，全市有7名干部分别受到党纪和行政撤职、降职等处分。
