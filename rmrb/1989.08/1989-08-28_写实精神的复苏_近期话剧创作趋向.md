The wave of anti-traditionalism in theater is subsiding, and stages that once leaned towards anti-character and anti-plot creation are seeking a new balance. The works of Stanislavsky, once scorned, are back on the bedside tables of some actors, and the style of Lao She, which was once suppressed, is once again a hot topic. His three thick volumes of plays are once again attracting attention on stage and screen. This phenomenon is not, as some people say, a case of being tired of rich flavors and wanting to return to a vegetarian diet. The fact is that people will not always be satisfied with shallow pools of technical tricks, and when people demand to dive into the deep waters of life and art, they once again recognize the value of realism and realistic style. Thus, the spirit of realism is revived at a new starting point. This new starting point provides historical possibilities for today's realism to advance in breadth and depth.

The main sign of the revival of the spirit of realism is the resurgence of character-driven and plot-driven methods, and the strengthening of internal rational spirit, which clearly distinguishes it from the avant-garde experimental plays of the previous two years that opposed character and plot and pursued irrationality. Although the three-dimensional realistic style of the script, performance, and stage design of "The Number One Restaurant in the World" was criticized by some critics for being outdated in concept and technique, it created the highest box office in the capital's theater in recent years. Obviously, true customs and manners, vivid and distinct personalities, and dramatic and plot-twisting narratives are still what the masses love. Certain historical relics deemed non-contemporary have not yet become history. "The Chronicles of Sangshuping," praised as the culmination of recent experimental theater, is fundamentally a firm individualistic method in its artistic technique. Although general commentary focuses on the use of directing techniques such as rotating stages, female statues, symbolic props like dancing cows, choruses, and dances, what primarily shocks the audience is the true and believable characters and their destinies. "Building Blocks," highly praised by experts, shows a clear tendency to return to tradition in its plot structure and dramatic scene development. The three adaptations of "Mourning Becomes Electra" (including Yue opera) at the O'Neill Theater Festival showed a strong tendency towards plot-driven narratives, and it is not an exaggeration to call them plot-driven plays. Even "The Great God Brown" and "You and I," which were created with expressionist techniques or spirit, received individualized character treatments from the directors. Even in small theater performances like "The God of Fire and the Autumn Woman," there is a different character from "The Station" and other small theater plays. The former is a perspective from a special individual to a general humanity, while the latter clearly wants to skip individuality and directly enter general commonality; the former has a complete story narration, while the latter deliberately breaks the plot norms, letting the picture, light, sound, and shape directly express the meaning.

The surge of this trend on the theater stage is not like the film industry's call for entertainment and commercial films, with a large number of critics cheering. It is like a quiet late tide, silently raising the water level, but the tide is vast and boundless, and difficult to stop. Some methods introduced or created in the experimental theater wave of the past two years, such as reconstructing multi-dimensional stage time-space styles, dance-like and rhythmic human body movements and shapes, abstract and symbolic stage designs, are further chewed, digested, and absorbed into the drama, serving the characters and plots. The conceptual expansion and technical exploration achievements of experimental theater over the years have broadened the vision of realism and greatly enriched its forms.

Form innovation has shifted from being the goal to being a means. Therefore, although the overall look of the theater stage and performance styles is quite different from the plays before the theater reform, there are fewer instances of methodical heat seeking to make a sensation. Although a batch of plays on the margins of the drama genre have emerged, with names such as lyric musical drama, sketch drama, rock dance drama, musical sculpture drama, novel-style lyric psychological drama, etc., many artists no longer pursue methods as the goal. An internal classical spirit is extended. New and unique methods lose their novelty effect, indicating that these methods or creation methods have been familiarized and recognized by people, and the shift in purpose is a sign of creation deepening. People's perspectives have shifted from the level of technical skills to the main body of drama—the human being.

    写实精神的复苏
    ——近期话剧创作趋向
    高鉴
    戏剧的反传统狂潮开始跌落，为反性格、反情节创作所倾斜的舞台开始寻求新的平衡，曾被鄙夷的斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的书重新回到一些演员的枕边，被一度轻抑的老舍风范重又成为热门话题，他的三部厚墩墩的剧作又在舞台和荧屏上引人注目。这现象并不像某些人说的那样是吃腻了荤腥，又想回头去吃全素斋。事实是，人们不会老满足于在手法层面的浅水池中扑腾，而当人们要求潜入生活和艺术的深水领域的时候，却再度认识了现实主义和写实风格的价值。于是，写实精神在新的起点上复苏。这一新的起点为今天的现实主义在广度和深度上的掘进，提供了历史的可能性。
    写实精神再度兴起的主要标志在于性格化、情节化手法重新抬头，内在的理性精神加强，这一趋向明显地区别于前两年反性格、反情节、追求非理性的先锋实验剧。《天下第一楼》编剧、表演、舞美、音响的立体型写实风格虽然受到部分批评家的轻抑，责其观念、手法陈旧，然而却创造了近年来首都话剧舞台最高的上座率。显然，真实的风俗人情、生动鲜明的个性和跌宕富于戏剧性的情节依然是群众钟爱之物，某些被批为非当代性的历史陈迹尚未成为历史。被誉为集近年来实验戏剧之大成者的《桑树坪纪事》，究其艺术手法的深层内核，依旧是坚定的个性化方法。虽然一般评论的兴趣焦点凝聚于转台、女人石像、舞牛的象征道具、歌队、舞蹈等导演手法的运用，但从整体上震撼观众的首先是真实可信的人物和他们的命运。很为行家们称道的《搭积木》在情节结构、戏剧场面的开掘上表露出明显的回归传统的倾向。奥尼尔戏剧节三台《悲悼》（包括越剧）的改编表现了强烈的情节化倾向，称它们为情节剧毫不过分。连《大神布朗》和《尤奕》这些以表现主义手法或精神写成的戏，也得到人物个性化的导演处理。即便像小剧场演出的《火神与秋女》，也表现出与《车站》等小剧场戏剧迥然不同的品格，前者是由特殊个性向一般人性的透视，而后者明显地要跳过个性直接进入一般共性；前者故事叙述完整，后者则故意敲破情节规范，让画面、光声、造型直接表达意蕴。
    话剧舞台上的这股潮流的涌出，并不像电影界呼唤娱乐片、商业片那样有大批评家摇旗呐喊，它像一股静静的晚潮，在无声无息中抬高了水位，然而那潮水却浩淼连天、难以阻遏。前两年实验戏剧大潮中引进或创造出来的一些手法，如复构多维的舞台时空样式，舞蹈化、韵律化的人体动作和造型，抽象化、象征化的舞台设计，进一步被咀嚼、消化，吸收在戏剧中，为人物、情节服务。多年来实验戏剧在观念上的拓展和在手法探索上的成就，开扩了现实主义的视野，大大丰富了它的形态。
    形式创新从目的转化为手段，因此虽然从整体看，话剧舞台、表演样式已大不同于话剧形式革命前的剧目，但是也较少看到手法热时那种故作惊人之笔了。虽然出现了一批处在话剧体裁边缘地带剧目，其称谓诸如抒情音乐话剧、写意话剧、摇滚舞蹈话剧、音乐造型剧、小说体抒情心理剧等等，但很多艺术家已不把手法的追求作为目的了。一种内在的古典精神得到伸展。新奇的手法，失去了新奇效应，说明这些手法或创作方法已为人们熟悉和认可，而目的转换则是创作深化的表征，人们的视点已从手法技巧的层面挪移到戏剧的主体——人的身上。
