Some developed economies have placed significant emphasis on energy development. Over the past decade, the energy cost per dollar of gross national product has decreased by 23% in the United States and by 31% in Japan. This sustained reduction in energy costs can be attributed to adjustments in industrial structure, advancements in energy technology, and effective policies and measures.

The U.S. Department of Energy has long encouraged domestic enterprises to adopt advanced energy technologies. The "Karina Cyclic Boiler Combustion Technology," developed in 1986, has undergone two years of testing and will be promoted in several cities this year. California has already invested $10 million in building a 3,000-kilowatt Karina power plant. Compared to the 150-year-old Rankine cycle, this advanced steam power cycle technology can improve thermal efficiency by 20% to 30%. If fully promoted across the United States, this could save $20 billion in fuel costs annually.

European Community countries generally believe that the 21st century will face energy shortages, so improving energy utilization and energy efficiency is an important way to alleviate energy shortages. The EC's goal is to increase energy utilization efficiency by 10% by the end of the century, based on the current level. This could save $250 billion to $350 billion in electricity investment. To save energy, Austria has been promoting high-efficiency civilian boilers nationwide since 1988. These boilers can burn waste and produce minimal pollution. The Netherlands is currently promoting "economic power stations," which have a comprehensive energy utilization rate of over 60%. These power stations not only supply electricity but also provide heat and hot water, reportedly saving 30% of energy consumption costs.

Japan has long prioritized energy conservation as a national policy. Over the past decade, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has spent 100 billion yen on energy conservation technology research. In 1987, the Japanese government identified key energy conservation technology research projects, including the development of large-scale energy storage batteries, commercial applications of fuel cells, heat pump technology, superconductivity and power transmission technology, and the development of ceramic internal combustion engines. According to the Japan New Energy Development Organization, Japan's energy structure will change by the year 2000, with a significant reduction in the proportion of oil in energy consumption.

There have been new developments in the utilization of nuclear energy. The United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and Japan are developing small, safe nuclear reactors to address local power and energy supply issues. The United Kingdom will launch four safe integral reactors by the end of the century. The United States is developing and manufacturing small nuclear reactors for home use.

    一些经济发达国家重视能源建设
    在过去十年中，一美元国民生产总值消耗的能源费用在美国降低了百分之二十三，日本降低了百分之三十一。据分析，能源费用持续下降应归功于产业结构的调整，能源技术的进步以及正确的政策、措施。
    美国能源部长期以来鼓励国内企业采用先进的能源技术。一九八六年开发成功的“卡里那循环锅炉燃烧技术”经过二年试验，今年将在部分城市推广。加州去年已投资一千万美元兴建容量为三千千瓦的卡里那电厂。同已经有一百五十年历史的朗肯循环比较，这种先进的蒸汽动力循环技术的热效率可提高百分之二十至百分之三十。如果美国全面推广，每年可节省燃料费用二百亿美元。
    欧共体国家普遍认为，二十一世纪将面临能源紧张的局面，因此，提高能源利用率和节能是缓和能源紧张的重要途径。欧共体的目标是，到本世纪末，在现有基础上将能源利用率再提高百分之十，这样可节省二百五十亿至三百五十亿美元的电力投资。奥地利为了节能，从一九八八年起在全国推广高效民用锅炉，这种锅炉不仅可燃烧废屑垃圾，而且污染很小。荷兰目前正在推广一种“经济型电站”，这种电站的综合能源利用率可达百分之六十以上，电站除供电外，还兼供热源、热水，据称可节省能耗费用百分之三十。
    长期以来，日本一直把节能列为国策。过去十年，通产省用于节能技术研究的费用高达一千亿日元。一九八七年日本政府确定的重要节能技术研究项目有：大型贮能电池开发、燃料电池的商业性应用、热泵技术、超导和电力输送技术以及陶瓷内燃机的研制。据日本新能源发展机构透露，日本在二○○○年以前能源结构将发生变化，石油在能耗结构中的比重将明显下降。
    核能的利用已有新的进展。美、英、西德和日本等国正在发展小型安全核反应堆，以解决局部区域供电供能的问题。英国将于本世纪末启动四台安全整体式反应堆。美国正在开发研制家用微型核反应堆。        （刘林森编译）
