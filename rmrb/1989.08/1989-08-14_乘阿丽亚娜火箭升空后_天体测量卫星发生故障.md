Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 12th.

In the early hours of Wednesday, an Ariane rocket successfully launched two satellites into their designated orbits. However, when the ground control center issued the command for the engines to fire and enter the synchronous orbit, the astrometric satellite showed no response. Over the past three days, researchers have made several attempts to restart the engine, but all have failed. The researchers are at a loss, unsure whether the issue lies with the engine, the remote control system, or the electronic system. If emergency measures are not taken promptly, the satellite will drift aimlessly in space, gradually approaching Earth, and eventually burn up upon re-entering the atmosphere. This incident has significantly impacted the French aerospace community, as years of hard work and billions of dollars in investment may be lost.

It is reported that the other satellite, a German television broadcast satellite, has successfully entered its operational orbit.

    乘阿丽亚娜火箭升空后
    天体测量卫星发生故障
    本报巴黎8月12日电　记者吕网大报道：本周三凌晨，欧洲阿丽亚娜火箭把两颗卫星送上预定轨道。可是地面控制中心发出发动机点火进入同步工作轨道的指令后，天体测量卫星竟毫无反应。3天来，科研人员经过几次努力，企图使发动机重新工作，均未成功，科研人员对此一筹莫展，不知是发动机毛病还是遥控系统或电子系统发生了故障。若不及时采取紧急措施，这颗卫星只能在天上“随波逐流”，在运行中逐渐接近地球，最后进入大气层时被烧毁。这次事故对法国宇航界震动很大，数年的辛勤劳动和几十亿资金也许就付之东流。
    据悉，搭乘阿丽亚娜火箭的另一颗德国电视直播卫星已顺利进入它的工作轨道。
