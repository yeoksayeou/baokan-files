On August 4th, under the blazing sun, five farmers in Dongshi Town, Zhijiang County, Hubei Province, hurriedly carried two large plaques towards the town. At the door of the town's grain management office, the five farmers lit firecrackers and presented the plaque inscribed with "Supporting Agriculture, Providing Excellent Service" to the office's head. The leading farmer, holding the hand of the grain management office director Huang Fenglu, said emotionally, "The grain management office has been great to us farmers. The 1,500-plus households in Caodian and Zhouping have asked us to represent them in expressing our gratitude."

Dongshi Town is a famous grain-producing area in the Yichang region. By 1982, within a radius of 100 kilometers, there were only 2 grain stations and 1 purchasing point. Many farmers had to travel over 20 kilometers to sell their grain. When farmers, drenched in sweat, finally reached the grain station with their grain, they either had to wait in long lines or endure the cold shoulders of the purchasing staff.

To make it easier for farmers to sell their grain, the Dongshi grain management office first increased the number of purchasing points from 2 to 11. During the peak purchasing season, they set up 5 mobile purchasing points and provided door-to-door service for revolutionary martyrs' families, teachers, and large grain sellers. The road in front of the grain management office was in poor condition, causing farmers' vehicles to often get stuck in muddy pits. They spent 250,000 yuan to pave the road smoothly. When farmers selling grain had nowhere to rest in the shade from the heat, they spent over 1 million yuan to build 7 permanent shade shelters at various purchasing points. Additionally, they constructed convenience halls and grain farmers' dining rooms.

During the spring plowing season this year, due to low temperatures, many households in the town had very low seed germination rates, causing farmers to worry as they watched their double-cropping area shrink. The grain management office immediately organized over 10 people to rush and purchase seeds, quickly allocating more than 110,000 kilograms of seeds, ensuring that the town's 23,000 mu of second-season rice was planted in the fields.

The "caring for grain farmers" spirit of the Dongshi grain management office staff is reflected in their protection of farmers' interests. In recent years, they have fully implemented the "three opennesses and one supervision" policy in purchasing, making prices, quality standards, and samples public, accepting farmers' supervision, and adhering to the principle of pricing based on quality. During this summer's harvest, the grain management office was short of 10 million yuan in purchasing funds. To avoid issuing "IOUs" to farmers, they raised nearly 10 million yuan on their own. In the past two years, Dongshi Town has been the first in the Yichang region to complete the grain storage task and has been named an advanced unit for excellent service in the provincial grain system for five consecutive years.

    情系粮农
    施友谊
    8月4日，骄阳似火。在湖北省枝江县董市镇的一条乡间小道上，5位农民模样的人抬着两块大匾，匆匆向镇子里赶去。在镇粮管所的大门口，这5位农民点燃鞭炮，把写有“支援农业，优质服务”的匾送到粮管所负责人手中。为头的那个农民拉着粮管所主任黄凤禄的手动情地说：“粮管所对我们农民没说的，我们曹店、洲平1500多农户要我们当代表，向你们道谢。”
    董市镇是宜昌地区著名的粮仓，到1982年，方圆百里，才只有2个粮站和1个收购点。不少农民卖粮要跑20多公里，当农民汗流浃背地把粮食挑到粮站时，不是摆“长蛇阵”，就是看收购员的“白眼”。
    为方便农民卖粮，董市粮管所首先把收购点由2个增加到11个，并在收购旺季设置5个流动收购点，对烈军属、教师、售粮大户定时上门收购。粮管所门前的路面不好，农民送粮的车常常陷在泥坑里，他们就拿出2.5万元，把路修得平平整整。卖粮农民天热找不到荫凉处休息，他们拿出上万元，在各收购点修建了7个固定歇荫棚。此外，他们还修建了便民厅，粮农食堂……
    今年春耕时，由于低温，镇上许多农户的种子发芽率极低，农民心急如焚，眼睁睁地看着复种面积就要落空。粮管所立即组织10多人，星夜兼程买种，很快调剂了11多万公斤种子，保证了全镇2.3万亩二季稻落种下田。
    “情系粮农”，董市粮管所干部职工的“情”体现在保护农民利益上。近年来，他们在收购中全面推行了“三公开一监督”，将价格、质量标准、样品公开，接受农民监督，坚持依质论价。今年夏收时，粮管所收购资金缺100万元。为了不给农民打“白条子”，他们自筹资金近百万元。最近两年董市镇在宜昌地区率先完成粮食入库任务，已连续五年被评为全省粮食系统优质服务先进单位。
