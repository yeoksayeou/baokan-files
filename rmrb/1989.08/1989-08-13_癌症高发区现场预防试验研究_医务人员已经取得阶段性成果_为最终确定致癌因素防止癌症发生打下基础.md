The preliminary results of China's large-scale field trials for cancer prevention in high-incidence areas have been achieved. Experts say these stage-wise results lay the foundation for ultimately determining the causes of cancer, preventing its occurrence, and controlling precancerous lesions.

Currently, China has approximately 1.2 million new cancer cases each year, with liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, and six other types being the most prevalent. Each type has its corresponding high-incidence regions. In recent years, key cancer prevention and treatment sites have been established in Jiangsu, Henan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Jiangxi, among other places. These sites conduct comprehensive research combining laboratory, clinical, and field studies, with some basic research already ranking among the world's leading efforts.

In Lin County, Henan, a high-incidence area for esophageal cancer, traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat precancerous lesions—severe esophageal epithelial hyperplasia—yielding initial results. The eight-year cumulative cancer transformation rate has decreased from 21.78% to 5.45%. The medical community hypothesizes that supplementing the diet with various vitamins and minerals can reduce cancer incidence. In 1985, China and the United States collaborated on a large-scale nutritional intervention trial involving over 30,000 adults aged 40-69 in Lin County, and some valuable responses have been tracked.

Qidong County in Jiangsu is a high-incidence area for liver cancer. Medical personnel have implemented comprehensive preventive measures, including preventing hepatitis B, removing mold and toxins, and improving water quality. Traditional Chinese medicine has also been used for precancerous treatment, achieving short-term results in reducing liver cancer incidence. Currently, China is collaborating with the World Health Organization to implement a globally significant "hepatocellular carcinoma immune prevention strategy" in Qidong. The goal is to prevent hepatitis and reduce liver cancer incidence by vaccinating against hepatitis B, thereby verifying and establishing the causal relationship between hepatitis B virus infection and liver cancer. To date, over 2,000 newborns within a population of 230,000 have received hepatitis B vaccinations, achieving good short-term results.

Additionally, Chinese medical researchers have discovered in field experiments that the trace element selenium has the effect of inhibiting the carcinogenicity of various carcinogens. Based on this result and the fact that many places are deficient in selenium, relevant Chinese institutions are collaborating with foreign counterparts to conduct population trials to prevent cancer by supplementing selenium.

    癌症高发区现场预防试验研究  医务人员已经取得阶段性成果
    为最终确定致癌因素防止癌症发生打下基础
    据新华社北京8月13日电　（记者于长洪、实习生温闽）我国开展的世界规模癌症高发区现场预防试验研究已经取得初步成果。有关专家称，这些阶段性成果的取得为最终确定致癌因素、防止癌症发生和控制癌前病变打下了基础。
    我国现在每年约有癌症病人120多万，以肝癌、胃癌、食管癌等9种为主，每种都有其对应的高发地区。近年来，江苏、河南、广东、云南、江西等地建立了重点癌症高发区防治现场，开展实验室、临床和现场三结合的综合研究，其中某些基础研究已进入国际先进行列。
    在食管癌高发地区河南林县，利用中医药物治疗食管癌前病变——食管上皮重度增生获得了初步成果，增生的八年累积癌变率已从21.78％下降到5.45％。通过膳食补充各种维生素和矿物质来降低癌症发病率是医学界的一个假设，1985年，中国与美国合作对林县3万多名40—69岁成年人进行了大规模人群营养干预试验，现已追踪到一些有价值的反应。
    江苏启东是肝癌高发县，医务人员在当地采取了防治乙型肝炎、防霉去毒、改变饮水质量等综合性预防措施，并运用中药等进行癌前治疗，已经收到了减少肝癌发生的近期效果。目前我国正与世界卫生组织合作，在启东现场实施具有世界意义的“肝癌免疫预防战略”，以求通过接种乙型肝炎疫苗预防肝炎来降低肝癌发生率，从而验证和确立乙型肝炎病毒感染与肝癌的病因相关关系。至今已对23万人群范围内的2000多名新生儿进行了乙型肝炎疫苗预防接种，收到了较好的近期效果。
    另外，我国医学工作者在现场实验中发现：微量元素硒具有抑制多种致癌物致癌的作用。针对这一结果和很多地方人体中缺少硒的实际，我国有关机构正与外国合作着手进行通过补充硒制剂来预防癌症的人群试验。
