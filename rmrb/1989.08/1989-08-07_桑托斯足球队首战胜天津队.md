More than 20,000 Tianjin football fans braved the high temperatures tonight at Minyuan Stadium to watch the friendly match between the Brazilian Santos Football Club and the Tianjin team. They witnessed the brilliance of world-renowned player Socrates. The result was a 4-1 victory for the Brazilian Santos team.

Both teams ended the first half with a 0-0 draw.

In the second half, the Brazilian team intensified their attacks. Five minutes in, due to a foul by the Tianjin team's goalkeeper inside the penalty area, they were awarded a penalty kick. The 8-numbered captain, Socrates, who stands at 1.91 meters tall, scored with a powerful shot. Before the applause could fade, the Brazilian team's 17-numbered player, Juarley dos Santos, scored another goal in the melee in front of the Tianjin team's goal.

Despite conceding two goals, the Tianjin team remained composed and launched several swift counterattacks. In the 20th minute, the 5-numbered Zhang Yu scored with a long-range shot, making the score 1-2. However, shortly after, the Brazilian team's 17-numbered black player scored another goal. In the 41st minute, Socrates, without waiting for the ball to drop, struck a powerful left-footed volley from the air, sending the ball directly into the net. The Brazilian team maintained a 4-1 lead until the final whistle.

    桑托斯足球队首战胜天津队
    新华社天津8月6日电  （记者孙永盛）今晚，二万多名天津球迷冒着高温，在民园体育场观看了巴西桑托斯俱乐部足球队同天津队的友谊赛，目睹了世界球星苏格拉底的风彩。结果，巴西桑托斯队以4∶1获胜。
    双方上半时以0∶0战平。
    下半场巴西队加强了进攻，5分钟后因天津队守门员在禁区内犯规，获罚点球机会。身高1.91米的8号队长苏格拉底主罚一脚命中。掌声未落，巴西队17号儒阿里·多斯桑托斯在天津队门前混战中又踢进一球。
    天津队虽连失两球，但方寸不乱，频频展开快速反击，5号张钺在第20分钟时一记远射，球从左下角入网，把场上比分追成1∶2。可是过了不久，巴西队17号黑人队员又射进一球。比赛进行到第41分钟时，苏格拉底在天津队门前未等球落地，左脚凌空怒射，皮球直飞入网。此后，巴西队把4∶1的比分保持到终场。
