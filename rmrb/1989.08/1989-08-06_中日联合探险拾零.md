The more than 30 members of the Chinese and Japanese teams who had conducted joint expeditions in the Tian Shan Mountains and the Taklamakan Desert parted ways here today. However, the deep memories filled with joy and sorrow will forever bind them together.

		A Horse Without a Name

	The horses became the most loyal friends of the expedition team.

	When the Northern Detachment braved the onslaught of rain, snow, and hail, they arrived at the Wuzharte Pass at an altitude of over 3,800 meters. The horse team carrying high-altitude equipment moved with great difficulty. On July 2, they encountered an ice crevice! It was a mysterious abyss of unknown depth, and the sound of a hidden river could be heard from within. The team members, along with the horses, carefully crossed over a giant boulder that spanned the crevice. Suddenly, a horse carrying 80 kilograms of supplies slipped and fell. When it tried to stand up for the second time, it had already slid to the edge of the crevice. Before the team members could rescue it, the horse fell into the crevice—without even a whinny, it disappeared forever.

		A Shared Birthday

	Two people sharing one birthday.

	On July 26, the team that had conquered the Snow Lotus Peak returned to the base camp. This day happened to be the 21st birthday of the Chinese team member Wang Yong. The previous day was the 22nd birthday of the Japanese team member Yamaoka Hideaki. At that time, he was descending from the mountain and had no time to celebrate. So, he simply moved his birthday to the 26th and celebrated it together with Wang Yong. The team members prepared a sumptuous dinner for them and, following Chinese folk customs, gave each of them a red-skinned egg. There were no red dyes on the mountain, so the red skin was actually a layer of red paper wrapped around the egg...

	As night fell, everyone lit candles, sang blessing songs, and danced joyfully until 4 a.m.

		A Poet

	At first, many people thought that Fujikawa Kiyoshi had a peculiar personality. Look, during the several dozen days of exploring Tian Shan and circling the great desert, he was always quiet and liked to think alone. However, when the expedition ended, at a celebration banquet, Fujikawa Kiyoshi, with tears in his eyes, loudly recited the lyrics of his newly created song "Tian Shan." People seemed to be instantly infected by his passionate and unrestrained emotions!

		“...
		Tian Shan accompanies our joys, sorrows, and griefs
		In a day, we have lost our way and returned countless times
		Time is like melting snow water
		The glacier is flowing endlessly…”

		This is a very talented poet. It is said that in Japan, his poems and lyrics are highly praised by young people.

		He said he wants the most famous composer in Japan to compose music for "Tian Shan," so that people all over the world can sing this song.

    中日联合探险拾零
    曾在天山山区和塔克拉玛干沙漠进行联合探险的中日双方30多名队员，今天在这里分手了。然而，那些充满欢乐与忧伤的深深记忆，却将他们紧紧连在一起，永远永远……
            一匹未取名的马
    马成了探险队最忠诚的朋友。
    当北路别动队冒着雨雪冰雹的疯狂袭击，来到海拔3800多米的木扎尔特达坂时，驮运高山装备的马队行进十分艰难。7月2日，偏偏又遇上了冰裂缝！那是一道神秘莫测的万丈深渊，里面的暗河传来哗哗的水声。队员们带着马，小心翼翼地从一块横搭在裂缝上的巨石上通过。突然，一匹驮着80公斤物品的马，在石旁失蹄滑倒了。当它第二次挣扎着想爬起来的时候，已滑到了裂缝边缘。还未等队员们设法搭救，它就又不由自主地跌进了冰裂缝——连一声嘶鸣都未能发出就永远消逝了。
            一个合过的生日
    一个生日俩人过。
    7月26日。征服雪莲峰的队员撤回了登山大本营。这天正好是中方队员王勇的21岁生日。而前一天，又是日方队员岩渊英人的22岁生日，由于当时他正从山上下撤，根本顾不上过。于是他就索性把生日挪到26日，和王勇合在一块庆贺。队友们为他们准备了丰盛的晚餐，还按照中国的民间习俗，给他们每人赠送了一只红皮鸡蛋。山上没有红色染料，那红皮儿实际上是裹着的一层红纸……
    夜幕四合，大家燃起了蜡烛，唱起了祝福的歌，跳起了欢快的舞，直闹到凌晨4点。
            一位诗人
    开始，许多人还觉得藤公之介性格有点古怪呢。你瞧，在翻天山和环绕大沙漠的几十天探险活动中，他始终寡言少语，喜欢独自思索。然而，当探险结束，在一次庆祝宴会上，藤公之介含着热泪高声朗读了他新近创作的歌词《天山》，人们却仿佛一下子被他那炽烈、奔放的情怀感染了！
          “……
    天山伴随着我们喜怒哀乐
    一日间不知曾几度迷途忘返
    时间犹如融化的雪水
    冰河在不断流淌……”
    这是一位颇有才气的诗人。据介绍，在日本，他的诗和歌词很受青年人的推崇。
    他说，他要让日本最有名的作曲家，为《天山》谱曲，让全世界的人都来唱这首歌。
