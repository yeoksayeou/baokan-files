A survey and analysis of the fee collection situation in Ren Tian Town of our county reveals that currently, rural areas have various fees, fundraising, and fines with numerous items and diverse forms, placing a heavy burden on farmers. Since 1988, this town has collected a total of 1.22 million yuan in various fees, amounting to 27.5 yuan per person, which is equivalent to 10% to 15% of the farmers' per capita net income. The existing problems are as follows:

	1.	Creating various names for unreasonable fees. In addition to the taxes and contributions to the village committee as stipulated by the province, farmers also have to bear unreasonable fees such as agricultural economic service fees, town construction fees, diesel management fees, certificate issuance fees, business license fees, and vehicle passage fees. Ren Tian's primary and secondary schools have 31 fee items, with 18 items added unilaterally by the schools.

	2.	Layered fees. For example, the building approval form costs 3 yuan at the township government and an additional 1 yuan at the village committee; the student admission examination fee is stipulated to be 8 yuan, but Ren Tian Middle School charges 15 yuan; timber fees, in addition to the unified collection by the forestry department as stipulated by the state, the township government also collects township management fees and forest compensation fees, and the village committee collects village management fees, etc. According to statistics, the purchase of 1 cubic meter of fir wood requires 150 yuan in various fees, equivalent to 1/4 of the current fir wood sales price.

	3.	High fees for reasonable items. For example, the marriage registration fee is stipulated to be 2 yuan, but Ren Tian charges 7 yuan; the school class fee is stipulated to be 2 yuan per student, but actually 2.5 yuan is collected, and so on.

	If necessary management and control measures are not taken to reverse this situation, it will inevitably affect the development of agricultural production.

### 江西瑞金县壬田镇——农村各样收费名目繁多

    江西瑞金县壬田镇——
    农村各样收费名目繁多
    一份我县壬田镇的收费情况调查分析表明：当前农村各种收费、集资、罚款，名目繁多，形式多样，农民负担繁重。这个镇自1988年始，各种收费总额达122万元，人均27.5元，相当于农民人均纯收入的10％—15％。其中存在的问题是：
    巧立名目乱收费。农民除负担省里规定的税费和上缴村委会积累，还要负担农经服务费、圩镇建设费、柴油管理费、出具证明用印费、乡村企业许可证费、车辆放行费等不合理费用。壬田中小学收费项目达31项，学校擅自增加的收费达18项。
    层层加码多收费。如建房审批表，乡政府收3元，村委会加收1元；学生升学报考费，上面规定收8元，而壬田中学竟收15元；木材收费，除国家规定的林业部门统一收费外，乡政府又加收乡管理费、森林补偿费，村委会加收村管费等。据统计，现购买1立方米杉木，各种收费要花去150元，相当于现行杉木销售价的1／4。
    合理项目高收费。如结婚登记费规定标准2元，可壬田收7元；学校班务费规定每个学生2元，实际收2.5元，等等。
    这种状况，如不采取必要的管理和控制措施加以扭转，势必影响农业生产的发展。
