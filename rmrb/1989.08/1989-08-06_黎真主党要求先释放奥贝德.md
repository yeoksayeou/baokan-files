The Hezbollah, supported by Iran, issued a statement in Beirut on August 5, demanding that Israel first release Hezbollah leader Obeid, before considering any proposal to exchange three Israeli soldiers.

The statement said that it is currently impossible to exchange hostages and release three Israeli soldiers as suggested by Israel.

On July 28, Israeli commandos kidnapped Obeid and two of his relatives in southern Lebanon. They proposed exchanging them and dozens of captured Lebanese Muslims for three Israeli soldiers and 16 Western hostages held by the Lebanese Shiite militia organization. Among the hostages, eight are American citizens.

The Algerian ambassador to Lebanon and the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Ghalib are currently mediating the release of the hostages.

The statement issued by Hezbollah on August 5 has seriously dampened hopes for an early resolution to the hostage crisis.

    黎真主党要求先释放奥贝德
    新华社贝鲁特8月6日电  伊朗支持的黎巴嫩真主党8月5日在这里发表声明，要求以色列首先释放真主党领袖奥贝德，然后再提出交换3名以色列士兵的建议。
    声明说，现在不可能按以色列的建议交换人质，释放3名以色列士兵。
    以色列突击队员7月28日在黎巴嫩南部绑架了奥贝德和他的两位亲属，建议用他们和几十名被俘的黎巴嫩穆斯林交换黎巴嫩什叶派民兵组织拘留的3名以色列士兵和16名西方人质，人质中有8名是美国人。
    阿尔及利亚驻黎巴嫩大使和联合国副秘书长古尔丁正在为释放人质问题进行斡旋。
    真主党8月5日发表的声明严重地打击了早日解决人质危机的希望。
