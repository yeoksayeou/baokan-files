Life is full of countless pleasures. For me, one of the greatest joys is buying vegetables.

Strolling through the vast meat and vegetable market, I see the fresh green of cabbages, the vibrant green of cucumbers, the fiery red of tomatoes, the long, jade-like lotus roots, the colorful array of green onions and garlic cloves. Chickens and geese, stretching their necks in the bustling market. A riot of colors, too much to take in, a dazzling spectacle of joy.

Walking here and there, looking around, I can freely choose the best, pick the fleshy and discard the lean. I can chat about anything, haggle over prices, no need to be cautious with words or weigh every phrase. Unrestrained, free and easy, this is another kind of joy.

You ask for 80 cents, I offer 50, back and forth we go, settling at 65 cents, both smiling as we part ways. Sometimes, over a mere cent or two, we argue until our faces are red and saliva flies. Why bother arguing over such small gains? The answer is: it's not about the tiny profit, but the joy of haggling.

Listen here to talk of national affairs, how the capital is flourishing as ever; listen there to gossip about children's marriages, how the countryside still has flowery bridal processions. At the stalls and counters, people discuss prices, criticize the party's conduct, spread rumors about some actor's sudden wealth, or rage about some official's abuse of power. All this, without buying a ticket, without any effort, listening to the grumbles of the alleys, the witty remarks of the market, peeking into the true feelings of people, this is yet another joy.

After buying vegetables, I head straight to the kitchen to start cooking. Whether it's stir-frying, steaming, or deep-frying. Sometimes I make a dish of spicy tofu, a plate of pickled cucumbers, a bowl of egg and squid soup. Buying the vegetables I love, cooking the dishes I love, the whole family gathered around the table, tasting and enjoying, this is a joy of savoring.

With these joys, it's like a rare treat. Therefore, every time there's a holiday or a day off, I eagerly go to the market to buy vegetables. My wife and daughter laugh and say, there are thousands of interests and hobbies in the world, but few like me who find joy in buying vegetables. I say, everyone has their own joys, and my joy in buying vegetables has its own story!

In the past, I experienced so many days of poverty, how could I not find joy in today's abundance?
In the past, I experienced so many monotonous days, how could I not find joy in today's vibrant colors?
In the past, I experienced so many stifling days, how could I not find joy in today's freedom and openness?
In the past, I experienced so many constrained days, how could I not find joy in today's unrestrained freedom?
In the past, I experienced so many bitter days, how could I not find joy in today's delicious tastes!

These words made my wife and daughter nod in agreement, deep in thought. Because of this, I hurriedly lit the lamp and spread the paper, recording this joy of buying vegetables, hoping that everyone who buys vegetables will have this joy too.

    买菜乐
    姚成友
    人生有数不清的乐趣。在我，以买菜为乐。
    徜徉于偌大的肉菜市场，看白菜嫩翠，黄瓜鲜绿，西红柿红若火焰，大莲藕长似玉臂，葱苗蒜瓣，杂陈斑驳之巷，黄鸡白鹅，引颈烦嚣之市。万紫千红，目不暇给，眼花缭乱之乐也。
    东站站，西走走，南瞧瞧，北望望，由我品头评足，挑肥拣瘦；任我说东道西，论斤计两，无须谨言慎行，不必字斟句酌。无拘无束，自由自在之乐也。
    你要八毛，我还五角，讲来还去，以六角五分成交，互相微笑而别。有时为了一角一分，争得面红耳赤口沫横飞。何必为了区区小利多费口舌？答曰：意不在蝇头微利，而在讨价还价之乐也。
    听这里高谈国事，京城又是繁荣如昨；听那边逼儿女婚嫁，乡间依旧花轿来去。摊前档边，谈物价，议党风，传某演员如何大发其财，怒某干部如何仗势欺人。如此等等，不用买票，无须费力，听里巷牢骚，市井妙语，窥人间真情之乐也。
    买菜回来，即行下厨点火升烟，或小炒，或清蒸，或油煎。或特作麻辣豆腐一盘，酱拌黄瓜一碟，鸡蛋鱿鱼汤一碗。买喜爱之菜，作喜爱之味，合家一桌，你品我尝，津津有味之乐也。
    有此数乐，等同于是一番难得的享受。因此，每逢节日假日，我都争着上街买菜。妻子女儿笑说，世上有千种兴趣万种嗜好，很少有像我这样以买菜为乐的。我说，人各有其乐，我这买菜之乐，可也是有些来历的哟！
    从前，我经历过那么多贫乏的日子，怎么能不以今天的丰盛繁富为乐呢；
    从前，我经历过那么多单调的日子，怎么能不以今天的斑斓蓬勃为乐呢；
    从前，我经历过那么多憋闷的日子，怎么能不以今天的舒心畅怀为乐呢；
    从前，我经历过那么多拘束的日子，怎么能不以今天的自由自在为乐呢；
    从前，我经历过那么多苦涩的日子，怎么能不以今天的津津有味为乐呢！
    一番话说得妻子女儿点头称许，若有所思。为此，忙拉灯铺纸，记下这买菜之乐，以愿天下买菜之人都有此乐也。
