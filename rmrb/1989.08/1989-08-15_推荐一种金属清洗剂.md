Recommendation for a Metal Cleaning Agent

When maintaining various vehicles and tractors, maintenance personnel often use high-quality gasoline and diesel as metal cleaning agents, which is a waste. For a 5-ton truck undergoing a third-level maintenance, at least 2.5 kilograms of gasoline is required; for a major overhaul, more than 10 kilograms are needed. The HX-3 type metal cleaning agent has a cleaning effect similar to gasoline and diesel, is non-corrosive, and is inexpensive. Last year, the Haining City Agricultural Machinery Supervision Station recommended this metal cleaning agent to more than 3,000 hand-held tractor drivers in the city, saving over 20 tons of diesel and more than 300,000 yuan. If all vehicles, tractors, and various mechanical equipment across the country use this metal cleaning agent during maintenance and repairs, it will save the nation a significant amount of energy each year.

    推荐一种金属清洗剂
    各种车辆、拖拉机保养时，维修人员总爱把高质量的汽油、柴油当作金属清洗剂，这是一种浪费。一辆5吨载重汽车做一次三级保养，起码要用2.5公斤汽油；大修一次，则在10多公斤以上。一种型号为HX—3型金属清洗剂，清洗效果如同汽油、柴油，无腐蚀性，且价格低廉。海宁市农机监理站去年向全市3000多辆手扶拖拉机手推荐了这种金属清洗剂，节约了20多吨柴油和3万多元钱。如果全国的汽车、拖拉机和各种机械设备在保养维修时，都用这种金属清洗剂，每年将为国家节约许多能源。
