    The city of Ma'anshan, which was originally a small village named Jinjiazhuang with only 78 households during the early days of liberation, has now developed into a prefecture-level city with a population of over 400,000. The Ma'anshan Steel Company (Ma'gang), one of the nine largest steel enterprises in the country, is the economic backbone of this city. The 40-year development history of Ma'gang is a microcosm of the development of China's steel industry.

    In the 1950s, the foundations for mining and iron smelting were laid. In the early 1960s, steel smelting and rolling were developed, and the unique nationwide railway wheel and tire factory was built. During the ten years of reform and opening up, the steel city has flourished. Large-scale steel smelting plants, initial rolling mills, and advanced high-speed wire rod mills with world-class technology have been put into production, enabling Ma'gang to achieve an annual steel production capacity of 20 million tons. In the past ten years, the realized profits and taxes have exceeded the total of the previous 25 years.

    The development of Ma'gang has driven the prosperous development of various industries in the city, including chemical, light textile, building materials, power, machinery, electronics, and higher education, as well as research institutes.

    欣欣向荣的钢城马鞍山
    马鞍山，解放初期原是仅住有78户人家的金家庄，现在已发展成为40余万人口的省辖市。全国9个特大型钢铁企业之一的马钢，是这个市的经济主体。马钢40年发展史是新中国钢铁工业发展的一个缩影。50年代，打下采矿、炼铁基础；60年代初，发展了炼钢、轧钢，并建成举国无双的火车轮箍厂。十年改革开放，钢城大放异彩，大型炼钢厂、初轧厂和具有世界先进水平的高速线材厂相继投产，使马钢达到年产钢铁200万吨的规模。近十年实现利税超过前25年的总和。
    马钢的发展带动了全市化工、轻纺、建材、电力、机械、电子和高等教育、科研院所等各行各业的蓬勃发展。
