Chinese scientists have made a significant breakthrough in the field of cow embryo division biotechnology. Researchers have successfully divided a cow embryo into four equal parts and successfully birthed a quarter-embryo calf.

This research was jointly completed by Tan Liling, an associate researcher at the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, her graduate student Li Leyi, and senior veterinarian Liao Hemo from the Phoenix Mountain Dairy Farm of Chengdu Agricultural Reclamation Company.

The researchers used a simple method to divide a seven-day-old cow embryo, which was not surgically collected, into two halves. They then divided each half into two, resulting in four equally sized quarter-embryos. These quarter-embryos were transplanted in pairs into surrogate mother cows. Two of the surrogate cows became pregnant. One surrogate cow gave birth to a pair of 1/4 embryo twin calves on July 17th of this year, and another surrogate cow gave birth to a 1/4 embryo calf on July 30th. Thus, China has the world's earliest three 1/4 embryo calves. These three calves are all healthy, of normal size, and their birth weights are the same as those of naturally born single or twin calves.

Experts explained that if this research result is popularized and promoted, it can increase the number of embryos and calves severalfold, and cow embryo transplantation will achieve greater benefits. Moreover, multiple births from a single embryo through multiple divisions will greatly promote the development of theoretical research in basic disciplines such as genetics and developmental biology, with important theoretical significance and practical application value.

    我国科学家新的研究成果
    奶牛胚胎四等分成功  四分之一胚牛犊出世
    新华社北京8月4日电　（记者杨兆波）我国在奶牛胚胎分割生物工程领域取得重大突破。研究人员首次成功地完成了四等分奶牛胚胎并获得四分胚牛犊。
    这项研究是中国科学院遗传研究所副研究员谭丽玲和她的研究生李乐义与成都市农垦总公司凤凰山乳牛场高级兽医师廖和模等共同合作完成的。
    科研人员使用简单分割二分胚的方法，先把一个非手术采集的七天奶牛胚胎分割成两半，再将这两个半胚各分为二，得到四个大小相等的四分胚。把这些四分胚成对地移植给受体母牛，结果有两头母牛妊娠。一头受体母牛在今年7月17日顺利产下一对同卵双胎1／4胚牛犊，另一头受体母牛在7月30日产下一头1／4胚母犊。这样，在我国就出现了世界上最早的三头1／4胚牛犊。这三头小牛均健康，大小正常，出生体重与自然生产的单胎或双胎牛犊一样。
    专家介绍，这项研究成果如果普及推广，可使胚胎和小牛数增加几倍，牛胚胎移植也会获得更大的效益。而且胚胎多次分割产生一卵多胎，将会大力推动遗传学、发育生物学等基础学科理论的研究与发展，具有重要理论意义和实际应用价值。
