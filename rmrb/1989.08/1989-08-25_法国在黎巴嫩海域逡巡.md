The French government decided yesterday to withdraw three warships that had entered Lebanese waters and to slow down the advance of the aircraft carrier "Foch." On the same day, President Mitterrand reiterated that France's military actions in Lebanese waters are aimed at "protecting its citizens." This indicates that after a few days of tense military operations, France may be adopting a more cautious stance.

Among Western countries, France has reacted most strongly to the armed conflicts in Lebanon. On August 12, France dispatched five envoys to relevant countries to lobby. Starting from the 16th, within five days, it sent four warships, including an aircraft carrier, to the eastern Mediterranean, rapidly increasing the number of French naval vessels there to eight. France's actions have been criticized by internal factions in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and have drawn close attention from the international community. People have raised a series of questions about the extent and nature of France's military intervention.

Firstly, regarding the objective of this military operation. The French government has repeatedly stated that the mission of the French navy is to provide humanitarian aid. However, this claim is not convincing. People will ask, why is it necessary to use an aircraft carrier to rescue citizens? Moreover, the factors causing the turmoil in Lebanon are complex, and France cannot have failed to foresee that its actions would inevitably provoke different reactions from various factions. Indeed, this is the case. The Christian faction led by Oron hopes for French aid and expects France to intervene militarily and provide weapons; while the Muslim faction strongly criticizes France's military actions, accusing France of pursuing a gunboat policy. Some Syrian media have also criticized France's "colonialist policy" from different angles. In this situation, the appearance of French warships, is it helpful in resolving the crisis or is it adding fuel to the fire? The answer is obvious.

Another question people are considering is that the Lebanese issue should be resolved politically. On August 16, the United Nations Security Council issued a statement on the Lebanese conflict, calling for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire from both sides and supporting the efforts of the Arab Three-Party Committee. As a member of the Security Council, France should take responsibility for effectively resolving the Lebanese conflict. However, after France's envoys met with representatives from the governments of Algeria, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia, but failed to achieve the expected results, it hastily dispatched warships, adding new contradictions and further complicating the situation, also making some Arab countries feel embarrassed. The public opinion believes that France's actions have somewhat exceeded the scope emphasized by the Security Council statement. Its consequences may be to make the problem more complicated. One cannot ignore the possibility of military escalation. A country gathering so many warships in a sea area always contains some dangerous factors. Imagine if the relevant countries take military actions in response, it will inevitably provoke the resentment of some factions in Lebanon, leading to counterattacks, and then the situation will be even more difficult to control.

After World War I, France long "administered" Lebanon. There, France has its "long-term interests." It wants to use Lebanon as a "base" for French Middle Eastern diplomacy. Based on these reasons, France has always invested considerable effort in the Lebanese situation.

In March and April of this year, the French side initiated a diplomatic whirlwind in Lebanon. It also meticulously organized a so-called "humanitarian" relief operation, but it failed due to the lack of support from both factions in Lebanon.

This time, France's advance into Lebanese waters has been criticized by relevant parties. The French Defense Minister announced last night that it would reduce its eight warships there to five. It is hoped that France's aforementioned new decision is the beginning of a wise move to reduce military intervention.

### 法国在黎巴嫩海域逡巡

    法国在黎巴嫩海域逡巡
    本报记者　张启华
    法国政府昨天决定后撤3艘进入黎巴嫩海域的军舰，同时放慢“福煦”号航空母舰前进的速度。同一天，密特朗总统重申，法国在黎巴嫩海域的军事行动是“保护侨民”。这表明，经过几天紧张的军事行动后，法国可能转向比较谨慎的态势。
    在西方国家中，对待黎巴嫩的武装冲突，法国反应最为强烈。8月12日，法国派出5名特使分赴有关国家游说。从16日开始，5天之内接连三次派遣包括航空母舰在内的4艘军舰开进东地中海，使那里的法国海军舰只迅速增加到8艘。法国的这些作法遭到黎巴嫩内部、叙利亚、伊朗方面的抨击，也引起国际社会密切的关注，人们对法国的军事介入的程度、性质提出了一系列疑问。
    首先，关于这次军事行动的目标问题。法国政府一再重申，法国海军的使命是进行人道援助。但这种说法难以令人信服。人们会问，营救侨民何须动用航空母舰？而且，导致黎巴嫩动乱的因素错综复杂，法国不可能不预见到它的行动势必引起各派不同的反应。事实正是如此，以奥恩为首的基督教派期待法国的援助，希望法国进行军事干预，提供武器；而穆斯林教派则猛力攻击法国的军事行动，指责法国奉行炮舰政策。叙利亚的一些舆论也从不同角度抨击法国的“殖民主义政策”。在这种形势下，法国军舰的出现，到底是有利于解除危机还是给严重的局势火上浇油？答案是不言而喻的。
    人们思考的另一个问题是，黎巴嫩问题应该政治解决。8月16日，联合国安理会已就黎巴嫩冲突通过一项声明，要求冲突双方立即全面停火，并支持阿拉伯三方委员会所作出的努力。法国作为安理会成员国，应当为有效地解决黎巴嫩冲突负起责任，可是，在法国特使会见了阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯三国政府的代表，但未能取得预期效果之后，它就匆匆忙忙地派出军舰，这就增加了新的矛盾，使局势进一步复杂化，也使一些阿拉伯国家感到为难。舆论认为，法国这一行动，多少是超越了安理会声明所强调的范围。它的后果可能是使问题更加复杂化。人们不能不考虑到军事失控的可能性问题。一个国家在一个海域结集这么多的军舰，总是包含着某种危险的因素。试想，如果有关国家也借此采取军事行动，必然会引起黎巴嫩一些派别的反感，进而开炮反击，那末局势就会更难以控制。
    第一次大战后，法国长期“代管”黎巴嫩。在那里，法国有它的“长远的利益”。它想把黎巴嫩作为法国中东外交的“据点”。基于这些原因，法国对黎巴嫩局势一直倾注相当力量。
    今年3、4月间，法国方面曾掀起一股黎巴嫩外交的旋风。它还精心组织一次所谓的“人道主义”的救援活动，但由于没有得到黎巴嫩两派的支持而受挫。
    此次，法国向黎巴嫩海域的进军，受到有关各方的批评，法国国防部长已于昨晚宣布将它在那里的8艘军舰减为5艘。人们希望，法国的上述新决定是它走向减少军事干预的明智行动的开端。
