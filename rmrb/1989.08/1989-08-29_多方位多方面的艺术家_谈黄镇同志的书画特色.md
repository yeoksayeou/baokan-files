When I took up my pen to write the preface for Comrade Huang's painting collection, I naturally thought of his extraordinary life, filled with a strong sense of legend.

Huang Zhen is a veteran of the Long March, a renowned diplomat who has served as ambassador to countries in Asia, Europe, and America, such as Indonesia, France, and the United States, and has been a key figure in China's foreign affairs. Later, he served as the Minister of Culture of the Central Cultural Department. In his early years, he studied at the Shanghai School of Fine Arts and the Shanghai New China Art University. During the national crisis, he took up arms and became a prolific artist.

In the 1950s, we discovered a sketchbook titled "Westward Sketches" at an old bookstall in Beijing. It was undoubtedly a survivor from the difficult years of civil war and cultural suppression, a rare revolutionary relic. We visited the editor of the book, Comrade A Ying, who only knew that it was passed on by someone who participated in the Long March, but he did not know who the author was. It was only later, when discussing this matter with Huang Zhen himself, that we learned it was his work. This shows that even in the harsh conditions of the Long March, he did not put down his brush. Moreover, at that time, he also wrote the scripts for the plays "Broken Shoes" and "Brave March to the Frontline," which were widely performed and circulated in the Red Army, especially in the First Front Army, inspiring the morale of the troops and the people. At the historic meeting celebrating the union of the First and Fourth Front Armies, the play "Broken Shoes" was performed and received a warm welcome from the broad masses of soldiers and civilians.

Huang Zhen is a Red Army leader who knows how to wield two weapons. He understands that battles are not just about blood and iron but also about the power of literature and art. He recognizes the aesthetic power and value of literature and painting that can touch people's hearts. During the Long March, he was the only one who could compile a collection of paintings. In recent years, the "Long March Painting Collection" has been published and distributed in English, French, Japanese, and other languages, receiving a warm welcome from readers at home and abroad.

Now, Comrade Huang is in his advanced years, but in his busy schedule, he still diligently paints, writes calligraphy, and seals. Subjects such as the strength of pines, the pride of plums, the fragrance of orchids, the soaring of eagles, the purity of lotuses, the firmness of stones, the majesty of mountains, and the rapidity of rivers all come from his brush. His calligraphy and painting are bold and rustic, with a mighty force like a thousand catty weight, and his seal carving, calligraphy style, and painting style are deeply rooted in national characteristics without falling into the ordinary. Indeed, his brushwork reveals a vast world, and mountains, rivers, and flowers all have emotions. It is not difficult to see that the author pays great attention to the profound thematic significance of his works, thus forming the noble intelligence and character of his works.

Because Comrade Huang's works are scattered among leaders, military and local cadres, soldiers, numerous ordinary workers, and international friends, it is very difficult to compile them into a collection. Although the task is difficult, it is even more respectful to Comrade Huang's approachable and amiable character.

Comrade Huang is an artist who understands the art of life, the art of work (diplomacy), and cultural art, with a legendary life experience and expertise. To this day, he is still creating high-level cultural and artistic wealth amidst his busy schedule.

    多方位多方面的艺术家
    谈黄镇同志的书画特色

    当我提笔为黄老画集写序的时候，便自然的想到他不平凡的带着浓重传奇色彩的经历。
    黄镇是经过举世闻名二万五千里长征的老红军老干部；也是中外闻名的外交家，在国际风云变幻中历任亚、欧、美，如驻印度尼西亚、法国、美国等国家的大使，和我国外事工作负责干部之一；后来又任我国文化工作的主要领导人——中央文化部部长。他早年曾就学于上海美术专科学校和上海新华艺术大学。在国难当头时投笔从戎，并且是创作了大量作品的美术家。
    回想在50年代，我们曾经在北京一个旧书摊上，发现了一本现场速写——长征内容的《西行漫画》的画册，它无疑是在那苦难内战年月文化专制主义时的一本幸存者，一本难得的革命文物。我们访问了该书编者阿英同志，他也只知道是由参加长征的人转来的，但不知作者是谁。只是后来同黄镇本人谈及此事时，才知道就是他的作品。由此可见，就是在那长征艰难的环境中，他并没有放下画笔。不但如此，当时他还写了《破草鞋》、《英勇上前线》等话剧和歌剧的剧本，在红军中，特别是在红一方面军中，广为演出流传，鼓舞了军队和人民群众的革命士气。在有历史意义的红军一、四方面军会师庆祝大会上，话剧《破草鞋》公演时受到了广大指战员和群众的热烈欢迎。
    黄镇是懂得使用两种武器的一位红军领导干部，他知道战斗不只是铁血的较量，有时也是文墨的战斗，他认识文与画是具有可以入人心腑的美学力量与价值。在长征中可以集画成集者亦仅此一册而已。近年来，《长征画集》又以英、法、日等外文出版发行，受到国内外读者的欢迎。
    如今，黄老年事已高，在繁忙的工作之余仍孜孜作画、写字、篆刻。诸如松之刚劲、梅之傲雪、兰之幽香、鹰之腾飞、荷之高洁，以及石之坚也，山之峻也，川之湍也……均出其笔下。其书画运笔豪放而质朴，有气势磅礴千钧之力，金石篆刻、书风画风系民族特质而不堕；真是笔下一墨见大千，山川花卉均有情；不难看出作者十分注意作品具有主题意义的深刻内涵，这就形成了他作品高尚的心智与品格。
    因为黄老的作品大都是散在领导人、军队与地方各级干部、战士、众多的普通工作人员，以及国际友人的手中，汇集成册十分困难，编事虽难，但倍感对黄老平易近人之敬佩。
    黄老是一位懂得人生艺术、工作（外交）艺术、文化艺术，并具有传奇性经历与经验的多方位多方面的艺术家；至今，他仍一如往昔——在繁忙中创造着高层次的文化艺术财富。
