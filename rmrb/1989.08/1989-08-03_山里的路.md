Title: Paths in the Mountains

    There are no paths in the mountains.
    The paths in the mountains
    Grow from under the feet of lumberjacks
    From under the feet of those who traverse the mountains.
    The paths in the mountains choose the steep and rugged places to grow,
    Twisting and narrow, like snakes dancing naturally.
    The youthful period of the paths in the mountains is very short;
    After their youthful period, they yield to the next youth.
    The paths in the mountains string together mountains and mountains.
    In the near future, the paths in the mountains
    Will also string together mountains and mountain-like buildings.

专栏：

    山里的路
    芦笛
    山里没有路
    山里的路
    是从伐木人的脚下
    从跑山者的脚下长出来的
    山里的路专拣险峻的去处生长
    且弯且瘦　如自然舞动的蛇
    山里的路青春期极短
    青春期过后便让位给青春
    山里的路把山和山串缀起来
    很近的将来　山里的路
    也会把山和山样的楼群串起来
