In early May of this year, Li Mingzhu, the secretary of the Xingtai Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province, rode his bicycle to Xingtai Normal College to have a dialogue with the students and faculty. When he reported on the region's efforts to build a clean government, the audience applauded 17 times. This incident reflects, to some extent, that the Xingtai Regional Committee's work on clean government has formed a new "mini-climate."

Since last July, the Xingtai Regional Committee has been resolutely determined to genuinely and firmly tackle the issue of building a clean government. They first focused on issues that the public pays close attention to and are relatively easy to address: curbing the four major forms of corruption—eating (feasts), receiving (gifts), housing (accommodation), and transportation (vehicles). Next, they targeted the critical issue of money-for-power exchanges, focusing on hidden cases within party and government agencies and departments that manage personnel, finances, and materials, where money is exchanged for power and vice versa. At the beginning of this year, they expanded the clean government campaign to grassroots law enforcement agencies, public utilities, enterprises, towns, and villages. Due to the Regional Committee's genuine efforts, phenomena such as using power for personal gain, feasting, gift-giving, and entertaining have been curbed, and the party's, government's, and public's conduct has begun to improve.

The wind of using public funds for feasting has been largely curbed; the phenomenon of "no gifts, no service; gifts, chaotic service" has significantly diminished; the issue of using power to secure special housing has been basically corrected; the problem of using public vehicles for private affairs has been resolved; and a number of serious cases of corrupt governance have been investigated and dealt with. According to statistics, over the past year, the region's reception expenses have been reduced by two-thirds, 35 households of officials in regional government agencies have returned illegally occupied houses, 200 million yuan of illegally used funds, 164 plots of land, and 249 rooms have been recovered from county (city) government agency officials and staff involved in private housing construction, the qualifications of 1,592 people who falsified their credentials for professional and technical titles have been revoked, 318 officials and workers who were transferred from enterprises and public institutions to party and government agencies in violation of policies have been removed, and 802 cases of embezzlement, bribery, and "official profiteering" have been investigated, with 405 corrupt officials receiving punishments.

The Xingtai region's clean government work has formed a climate primarily because the Party Committee secretary attaches importance to it and unifies the thinking of the "leadership team," truly regarding clean government building as an extremely urgent issue in the Party's work. Initially, some people thought that the improper winds had become "chronic diseases" and that "without changing the big climate, it is difficult to change the small climate." During their investigations, the Regional Committee leaders learned that officials and the public strongly opposed corrupt practices. In one county, nearly 100 million yuan was spent on receptions and feasts in a single year; just the fuel costs for regional government agency leaders' small cars for commuting amounted to over 2.3 million yuan annually. These phenomena made the Regional Committee realize that without the Party Committee's determination to tackle clean government issues, it would be difficult to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of officials and the public. The key to forming a clean government climate in a place does not lie in external conditions but in whether the Party Committee takes action and how it does so.

Having the determination to tackle clean government issues, the most important thing is to do so genuinely and firmly. The key here is: first, to start from the leaders of the Regional Committee and the Executive Office, and from the regional government agencies, gradually expanding to counties and cities, from top to bottom, setting an example at every level. In July last year, after the Regional Committee and the Executive Office issued regulations prohibiting the use of public funds for feasting, the secretary and the executive followed the regulations strictly, did not accept cigarettes and alcohol when going to the countryside, did not have special meals, ate with the locals, and paid for meals according to regulations, setting an example for those below. Recently, the Regional Committee and the Executive Office issued another regulation, canceling the special cars for the main leaders of the region and counties (cities). Second, to be genuine and dare to tackle hard cases. For major cases, the leaders of the Regional Committee and the Executive Office personally intervened, removed obstacles, and firmly investigated and dealt with them. Third, to genuinely rely on the masses. The Regional Committee and the Executive Office formulated various clean government systems, invited the public to participate, and let the public supervise; they established reporting centers and boxes at every level to allow the public to expose problems; for the handling of major cases, they also organized public discussions. In March of this year, the Regional Committee conducted a survey of 10,000 people, collecting over 11,000 opinions from the public on clean government work. To open up channels for the public to express their opinions, the secretary of the Regional Committee, Li Mingzhu, publicly announced his telephone number and seriously handled letters and visits from the public. In the year since he took office, he personally handled over 1,900 letters from the public and received over 700 visits, discovering a large number of cases of officials violating laws and discipline.

### 痛下决心　抓实抓狠  邢台地区形成廉政小气候

    痛下决心　抓实抓狠
    邢台地区形成廉政小气候
    本报讯　今年5月初的一天，河北省邢台地委书记李明珠骑着自行车到邢台师范专科学校对话。当他通报全区抓廉政建设的情况时，师生们前后鼓掌17次。这件事从一个侧面反映了邢台地委的廉政工作已形成了新的“小气候”。
    邢台地委从去年7月起痛下决心，实打实地抓廉政建设。他们首先从群众盯得紧、又比较容易抓的问题入手，狠刹吃（吃喝）、送（送礼）、住（住房）、行（坐车）四个方面的不正之风；接着抓住钱权交易这个要害问题，重点对党政机关和掌管人、财、物的实权部门中以钱换权、以权换钱等较隐蔽的案件进行查处；今年初，又将廉政建设扩展到基层执法部门、公用事业单位和企业、乡村。由于地委真抓实做，以权谋私、吃喝送请等不廉现象受到遏制，党风、政风、民风开始好转。
    公款吃喝的歪风基本刹住；“不送礼不办事，送礼乱办事”的现象大为收敛；利用职权在住房上搞特殊化的问题基本纠正；用公车办私事的问题得到了解决；一批严重为政不廉的案件受到查处。据统计，一年来全区接待费用比过去减少2／3，收回地直机关35户干部多占的房子，清退县（市）直机关干部职工在营建私房中违纪占用款项200多万元、宅基164处、房249间，取消了在专业技术职称评聘中弄虚作假、不够条件的1592人的聘任资格，清退了318名违犯政策规定从企事业单位调入党政机关的干部和工人，立案查处了贪污受贿、“官倒”等违法违纪案件802起，405名为政不廉的干部受了处分。
    邢台地区廉政工作能形成气候，首先是由于党委书记重视，并统一“一班人”思想，真正把廉政建设当作党的工作中一个极为紧迫的问题来抓。开始有人认为，不正之风已成“顽症”，“大气候不变，小气候难办”。地委领导同志在调查中了解到，干部群众对腐败现象反映强烈。有个县一年招待吃喝就花了近百万元；仅地直机关领导干部上下班坐小车一年油费达23万多元。种种现象使地委认识到，党委不下决心抓廉政，就难以调动广大干部群众的积极性。而一个地方要形成廉政的小气候，关键不在外部条件，而在于党委抓不抓、怎样去抓。
    有了抓廉政的决心，最重要的是抓得实，抓得狠。这里的关键在于：一是从地委、行署领导做起，从地直机关抓起，逐步扩展县、市，从上到下，层层做出表率。去年7月，地委、行署做出禁止用公款吃喝的规定后，书记、专员自觉遵守，严格执行，下乡不动烟酒，不开小灶，随乡入俗吃便饭，每次就餐都按规定交费，给下边做出样子。最近，地委、行署又作出规定，取消了地县（市）主要领导干部的“专车”。二是动真的，敢碰硬。对于较大的案子，地委、行署领导亲自出面，排除阻力，坚决查处。三是真心实意依靠群众。地委、行署制订各项廉政制度，请群众参与，让群众监督；层层设立举报中心和举报箱，让群众检举揭发问题；重大案件的处理，还要组织群众议论。今年3月，地委开展了万人问卷调查，收集群众对廉政工作的意见11000多条。为了疏通群众反映的渠道，地委书记李明珠向社会公布自己的电话号码，并认真对待群众来信来访。他到职一年来，亲自处理群众来信1900多封，接待群众来访700多人次，从中发现了大量干部违法乱纪的问题。　（石玉春　王殿银）
