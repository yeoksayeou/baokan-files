Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial city, endured a combined assault of typhoon, high tide, and heavy rain from last night to this morning. The city's 80,000 anti-flood and rescue troops fought through the night at critical points and key departments. At 6:30 AM this morning, Typhoon No. 13, which had been heading straight for Shanghai, made landfall in Chuansha County and swept across the city. Shanghai remained unscathed, with no casualties, no collapsed buildings, and normal production and living order.

Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Shanghai Municipal Flood Control Command Center held an emergency telephone conference to announce the emergency alert for Typhoon No. 13. The entire city immediately entered a state of readiness for flood control and rescue. Emergency measures to prevent major disasters were prepared, from guarding dangerous sites to preparing rescue materials, from evacuating people and materials to protecting key facilities such as electricity, water, gas, and transportation, all were ready for the worst-case scenario.

At 3 AM today, the water level in the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek reached 5.04 meters, exceeding the warning water level by 64 centimeters and 1.54 meters above the surface of Nanjing Road. This is the second-highest water level recorded in Shanghai since 1913. Leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Government, including Zhu Rongji, visited the Huangpu River to inspect the water level, direct flood control efforts, and express their concern for the frontline troops fighting against the typhoon and floods.
