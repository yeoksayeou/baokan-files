Today's Six Swans City
By People's Daily reporter Wang Jin

"Isn't that place poor? What's there to see?!" someone advised me before I went to Guizhou's Six Swans City for an interview. At the end of July, when I set foot on this land, the scene before my eyes was that of a newly emerging city.

Six Swans City is located in the western part of Guizhou, on the eastern slope of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. It is rich in energy resources. Since the mid-1960s, the state has been developing it as a key area for the Third Front construction, investing a total of 3 billion yuan, forming the embryonic form of a highland energy and building materials city.

In December 1978, the State Council officially approved the establishment of Six Swans City. After 10 years of construction, this city with a population of over 2 million has risen like a brilliant new star from the Wumeng Mountains, with the city's gross domestic product rising from 580 million yuan to 1.34 billion yuan.

In the evening, the breeze is cool. The reporter strolls along the wide Zhongshan Street. There are few cars and bicycles, and the quiet environment contrasts sharply with the noise of northern metropolises. Along both sides of the street, under the shade of green trees and red flowers, various buildings such as department stores, libraries, theaters, hospitals, schools, and entertainment venues stand in rows. The lively music from the dance hall, the fashionable clothes of the young men and women walking on the sidewalk, and the various goods displayed in the shops all make one strongly feel the tremendous changes that the reform and opening up have brought to the closed environment of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.

If the city service network of Six Swans City is just beginning to take shape, then the most indicative of the city's economic strength is the industrial system with energy development as its mainstay. The city is known as the "coal sea of the south." The 99,000 square kilometers of land under its jurisdiction have coal reserves of 15 billion tons. At the same time, it has also discovered more than 20 kinds of metal and non-metal minerals such as iron, lead, zinc, copper, mercury, and uranium, as well as rare elements such as cadmium, germanium, gallium, indium, and silver. Currently, a number of large enterprises such as the Six Swans, Panjiang, Shuicheng Mining Bureau, and Shuicheng Steel Company have risen in Six Swans City.

The attraction of Six Swans City is obvious. At a symposium, the reporter was surprised to find that among the six participants, most were "old pioneers" who had come from Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Hubei, and other places to support the Third Front construction in the 1960s and had stayed here ever since. I asked Zhang, who is in his fifties and from Shanxi, "Do you want to go back to your hometown?" He slowly shook his head and said, "Even if the order to transfer me back comes, I wouldn't want to go!" "Why?" He listed several advantages of Six Swans City and said happily, "I have gotten used to living in this developing city. Not only does it have a good development prospect, but the climate is also pleasant."

Local visionaries told the reporter that Six Swans City has both advantages and disadvantages: First, the transportation capacity cannot meet the needs of energy development. Taking the Shuicheng Mining Bureau as an example, from January to June this year, the planned coal production was 1.9726 million tons, the railway approved transportation volume was 1.80316 million tons, but the actual transportation volume was only 1.63746 million tons, completing only 88.5% of the total transportation volume. The mine's production capacity can reach 1,200 tons of coal per day. According to this calculation, 170 carloads are needed, but now only about 100 carloads are supplied, far from meeting the production needs. Second, in the vast remote rural areas under the city, economic development is slow, and 40% of the farmers have not solved the problem of subsistence. Currently, the national transportation department is comprehensively considering plans to improve Six Swans City's transportation. The expressway from Pan County Special Economic Zone to Baise, Guangxi, and the section from Hongguo to Nanning of the Nanning-Kunming Railway are expected to be completed in the next few years. The municipal party committee and government are drafting the "Subsistence Project" and "Vegetable Basket Project," attempting to drive rural economic development through technological radiation.

    今日六盘水

    “那是个穷地方，有什么值得看的？！”赴贵州六盘水采访前，有人这样劝我。7月末，当我踏上这片土地时，视野里的画面是：一座新兴的城市。
    六盘水市地处贵州西部、云贵高原东斜坡地带，能源丰富，自60年代中期，国家就开始把它作为三线建设的重点进行开发，先后投资30亿元，形成了高原能源、建材城市的雏形。
    1978年12月，国务院正式批准成立了六盘水市。经过10个年头的建设，这座拥有200多万人口的城市像一颗璀璨的新星从乌蒙山冉冉升起，全市国民生产总值从5.8亿元上升到13.4亿元。
    傍晚，凉风习习。记者漫步在宽阔的钟山大街上。汽车和自行车很少，幽静的环境与北方大都市的嘈杂形成鲜明的对照。街道两旁绿树红花的掩映中，综合商场、图书馆、影剧院、医院、学校、娱乐场所等各式建筑鳞次栉比。舞厅里传出的那节奏明快的音乐，人行道上漫步的青年男女时髦的衣装，以及商店里陈列的琳琅满目的商品，都让人强烈地感受到改革开放给云贵高原封闭环境所带来的巨大变化。
    如果说，六盘水的城市服务网络刚刚形成的话，那么最能显示这个城市经济实力的，则是以能源开发为主的工业体系。该市素有“江南煤海”之称。全市所属的9900平方公里的土地上，煤炭保有储量150亿吨，同时还探明含有铁、铅、锌、铜、汞、铀等20多种金属、非金属矿产及镉、锗、镓、铟、银等稀有元素。目前雄踞六枝、盘江、水城三个矿务局和水城钢铁公司等一批大型企业已崛起在六盘水。
    六盘水的吸引力是显而易见的。在一次座谈会上，记者意外地发现，参加座谈会的六人中，大多是60年代从北京、河北、山西、湖北等地支援三线建设至今留在这儿的“老开拓”。我问来自山西、现年已五十好几的老张：“还想回老家吗？”他慢悠悠地摆摆手说：“下调令拉我回去，我都不乐意走！”“怎么啦？”他历数了六盘水的几大优势，乐呵呵地说：“我住惯了这个发展中的城市，这里不仅开发前景好，而且气候也宜人。”
    当地有识之士告诉记者，六盘水市有优势也有劣势：一是运输能力不能满足能源开发的需要。仅以水城矿务局为例。今年1—6月份安排原煤产量197.26万吨，铁路批准运量180.316万吨，而实际运量只有163.746万吨，只完成总运量的88.5％。该矿生产能力日产煤可达1200吨，照此推算需车皮170个左右，而现在只能供给车皮100个左右，远远满足不了生产的需要。二是在市属大片偏僻的乡村，经济发展步履维艰，40％的农民还未解决温饱。目前，国家交通部门正在通盘考虑改善六盘水交通的计划，盘县特区至广西百色的大公路和南昆铁路红果至南宁段可望在近几年修通。市委、市政府正在拟定“温饱工程”和“菜篮子工程”，试图通过科技辐射，带动乡村经济。
