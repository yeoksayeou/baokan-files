Some market inspectors from the Baoding City Tax Bureau in Hebei Province have reported that collecting scattered taxes is difficult, and collecting scattered market taxes is even more challenging.

Some taxpayers do not distinguish between taxes and fees, have a weak tax awareness, and are very assertive. From mid-April to mid-May this year, Qingyuan County alone saw three incidents of taxpayers assaulting tax officials. On April 19, Yan Haikuan, an inspector from the Quankun Tax Bureau, was collecting taxes at the Qingliangcheng market in the county. Villagers Zhou Heiqiu and Li Xiaoying, under the pretext of inquiring about tax policies, started a disturbance. When Yan Haikuan refuted them, he was struck on the head, resulting in a concussion. At the Lianmeng Road Tax Bureau, ten market inspectors have been assaulted by taxpayers. Market personnel are complex, with most having low educational levels, and some are even released criminals. Some threaten tax officials, saying, “If you make me pay taxes again, I’ll stab him!” Such taxpayers leave inspectors feeling helpless.

Tax enforcement is a serious issue in current tax work. Tax authorities have few and weak enforcement measures. When violent tax evasion incidents occur, they have to seek help from local police stations. However, some provisions in the current tax laws are not specific enough, making enforcement difficult.

Therefore, they call for: strengthening tax collection and management measures, enhancing tax legislation, and ensuring that tax collection is carried out in accordance with the law. Let the law truly become their protector.

    税收立法亟待加强
    河北保定市税务所的一些市场专管员反映，征零散税难，征市场零散税更难。
    有的纳税户分不清税与费，纳税意识淡薄，态度十分强硬。今年4月中旬至5月中旬，仅清苑县就发生3起殴打税务干部案件。4月19日，全昆税务所专管员阎海宽到该乡清凉城集市征税，清凉城村民翟黑球、李小迎二人借询问税收政策为名寻衅闹事。当阎海宽反驳时，头部被打成脑震荡。在联盟路税务所，先后有10名市场专管员遭纳税人殴打。市场人员复杂，大多数文化水平较低，甚至还有刑满释放分子，有的威胁税务人员：“再让我交税就捅了他！”对这样的纳税户，专管员感到无可奈何。
    税收软化是当前税收工作中的一个严重问题，税收部门执法手段太少、太弱，一旦发生暴力抗税事件，要寻求公安派出所的帮助。但现有税法中一些条例规定得不太具体，执法部门感到很为难。
    因此，他们呼吁：强化税收征管手段，加强税收立法，把依法治税落到实处。让法真正成为他们的保护神。
