Shanxi Province places great importance on the protection of cultural relics. In recent years, it has allocated over 9 million yuan for the maintenance, repair, and preservation of historical sites.

Shanxi is one of the cradles of the Chinese nation and is known as the "treasure house of ancient Chinese architecture." It boasts the largest number of ancient buildings in the country. In recent years, the provincial government has prioritized the protection of cultural relics. In January 1987, the provincial People's Congress passed the "Implementation Measures for the Protection of Cultural Relics in Shanxi." The Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics mobilized over 1,800 experts and officials to conduct a comprehensive survey of cultural relics in counties, towns, and villages across the province, thereby establishing a clear inventory of Shanxi's cultural relics. A total of 31,401 cultural relics were identified, and 180 provincial-level key cultural protection units were announced.

Shanxi strictly enforces the Cultural Relics Protection Law, delineating protection zones and construction control areas for 154 national and provincial-level key cultural relics. Most counties, towns, and villages have established a three-tier network for cultural relics protection, implementing a responsibility system for cultural relics protection. The province invested 190,000 yuan to install iron doors, windows, safes, and alarm systems in the cultural relics storage facilities of five key cities.

In addition to national investments, Shanxi Province has invested 9 million yuan to meticulously repair a batch of precious ancient buildings, including the Shuxiang Temple in Datong and the Jin Temple in Taiyuan, enhancing their historical, artistic value, and charm.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 12th (reporter Zhang Shuying) Providing citizens with joyful and healthy cultural lives has been one of the key initiatives undertaken by the Tianjin municipal government and cultural authorities in recent years. In the past two years, Tianjin's cultural stage has been vibrant and diverse.

Tianjin has a large number of theater enthusiasts. The Municipal Bureau of Culture organizes an average of six large-scale theatrical performances each year. To meet the diverse cultural needs of the public, Tianjin has also hosted multiple "Spring of Ballet" and "World Famous Music Appreciation" concerts. The city has established a dedicated venue for traditional Chinese folk arts, "Zhonghua Quyuan," and the Municipal Performance Company frequently invites troupes from other regions to perform in Tianjin, averaging over 100 performances per year. Last year, Tianjin staged over 2,000 performances of opera, music, dance, drama, folk arts, and acrobatics, attracting more than 2.5 million viewers; this year, despite the impact of political unrest, 700 performances have been organized in the first half of the year.

    山西重视文物保护  天津舞台绚丽多姿
    本报太原8月12日电　记者王艾生报道：山西省重视文物保护，几年来拨款900余万元管护、修缮、保存文物古迹。
    山西是中华民族发祥地之一，有“中国古代建筑宝库”之称，遗留的古代建筑数量居全国之首。近几年，省政府重视文物的保护，1987年1月，省人大通过《山西文物保护实施办法》，省文物局系统抽调1800余名专家、干部，对全省县、乡镇、村的文物古迹逐个调查，查清了山西文物的底子。共查出文物古迹31401处，同时还公布省级重点文物保护单位180处。
    山西严格执行文物保护法，划定国家级和省级重点文物保护单位的保护范围以及建设控制地带154处。大多数县、乡、村设立三级文物保护网，实行文物保护责任制。省投资19万元，对5个重点地市的文物库安装铁门、铁窗、铁柜和警报器。
    除国家投资外，山西省投资900万元，对大同下华严寺、太原晋祠等一批国家级省级的珍贵古代建筑，进行精心修缮，使这些古建筑更加显露出它们特有的历史、艺术价值及魅力。
    据新华社天津8月12日电　（记者张淑英）让市民们享受到欢乐、健康的文化生活，这是近几年天津市政府和文化主管部门办的实事之一。这两年天津市的文艺舞台，可以说是好戏连台、丰富多彩。
    天津“戏迷”比较多，市文化局平均每年都组织6次大型戏剧演出活动。为了适应群众多样的文化需求，天津还多次举办“芭蕾之春”、“世界名曲欣赏”等歌舞晚会，市里设立了专门演出曲艺的场所“中华曲苑”，市演出公司经常邀请外地的剧团来天津演出，平均每年就有百余个。去年天津市共演出戏曲、音乐、舞蹈、话剧、曲艺、杂技等两千多场，观众达250多万人次；今年上半年虽受政治动乱的影响，仍组织700多场演出。
