Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 6th.

Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze stated on August 6th in Kabul that the Soviet Union fully supports the political policies of the current regime and will continue to provide assistance in all aspects.

Currently, the political and military situation in Afghanistan is complex. The Mujahideen have intensified their attacks on several major cities and strategic locations, and the capital Kabul has been repeatedly hit by rocket and missile strikes. At present, out of Afghanistan's 31 provinces, 6 have been seized by the Mujahideen. It is under these circumstances that the Soviet Foreign Minister has come for a visit.

Although Shevardnadze only stayed in Kabul for one day, he met with all the key figures, including the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Interior of the Kabul regime.

According to TASS, both sides expressed during their talks the desire to resolve the Afghan conflict peacefully and believe that there are now more favorable conditions for achieving a ceasefire based on rational compromise and national unity. However, the Afghan side emphasized that it will respond appropriately to any attempts by the Mujahideen to seize power by force. The Soviet side fully understands and supports this policy.

    谢瓦尔德纳泽在喀布尔表示
    苏联继续支持喀布尔政权
    新华社莫斯科8月6日电  苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽6日在喀布尔表示，苏联完全支持现政权的政治方针，并将继续向它提供各方面援助。
    当前，阿富汗政治军事局势复杂，游击队向一些大城市和战略要地加强了攻势，首都喀布尔连遭火箭和导弹袭击。目前阿富汗全国31个省，已有6个省被游击队占领。苏联外长正是在这种情况下前来访问的。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽虽然只在喀布尔逗留一个白天，但会晤了包括喀布尔政权总统、总理、外长、国防部长和内务部长等在内的所有要人。
    据塔斯社报道，双方在交谈中表示要以和平方式来解决阿富汗冲突，并认为现在出现了在理智妥协和民族团结基础上实现停火的更为有利的条件。但同时，阿富汗方面强调，它将给游击队试图用武力夺取政权的行动以应有的打击。苏联方面则完全理解和支持这一方针。
