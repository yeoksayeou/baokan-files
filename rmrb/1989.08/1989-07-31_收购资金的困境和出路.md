Sharing the predicament of issuing "white slips" (IOUs) for procurement, which hurts farmers' feelings, damages the government's credibility, and also troubles the Agricultural Bank. However, procurement involves many aspects. Let's take a look at the situation in Xiangfan.

The Predicament and Solutions for Procurement Funds
Reporter: Jiang Xia

This year, despite some local areas suffering from disasters, Xiangfan, which accounts for more than half of Hubei Province's summer grain, still had a good harvest. The grain is in hand, but farmers are still worried, not knowing how much cash they will get after selling the grain. Xiangfan Agricultural Bank President Yang Qiyou responded decisively: "This year, we have made up our minds. For the summer grain contract procurement and the negotiated price conversion to the planned price, we will either pay in cash or issue transfer checks, completely at the farmers' discretion, and resolutely eliminate 'white slips.' No matter what, we cannot let down the farmers. The lessons from last year were quite profound."

When it comes to last year's "white slips," bank presidents still have "aftershocks." Despite the efforts of various levels of the Agricultural Bank to borrow from all sides, farmers still ended up with about 50 million yuan in "white slips," with some not being redeemed until May of this year. Some farmers, after failing to redeem the slips several times, angrily tore them up on the spot.

Xiangfan is a major producer of various agricultural and sideline products. In the past two years, raising procurement funds has become a "sore spot" for the Agricultural Bank at all levels. Some branches start preparing as early as the Lantern Festival. Spring cocoons, ramie, tea, shiitake mushrooms all come to market in April and May, summer oil and summer grain start harvesting in June, followed by tobacco and sesame, and by September and October, the mid-season rice hasn't been procured yet, and cotton procurement is already pressing. Some grains and cotton are not fully stored until the next year. Out of the 12 months in a year, the Agricultural Bank is busy for 10 months, with procurement funds accounting for more than 40% of the bank's total loans. They jokingly say that the Agricultural Bank is becoming a "procurement bank."

The funds for agricultural and sideline product procurement are enormous and concentrated. Due to the increasing procurement volume and rising prices, the demand for procurement funds is growing. After the credit tightening in 1988, the contradiction became more pronounced. According to the current fund management system, the central bank does not guarantee the funds of specialized banks, and the upper-level banks of specialized banks do not guarantee the funds of lower-level banks. The increased procurement funds mainly have to be balanced by the Agricultural Bank layer by layer, relying on new deposits to solve the problem. However, in reality, the Agricultural Bank finds it difficult to bear this burden. By the end of 1988, the deposits of the Agricultural Bank in Nanxian County had increased by 41.45 million yuan compared to the end of 1985, nearly doubling, but the agricultural and sideline product procurement loans had increased by 65.66 million yuan in the same period. Even if all the new deposits were used for agricultural and sideline product procurement, they would still not meet the needs.

The Agricultural Bank is not a "procurement bank," and new deposits cannot all be used for procurement. Spring plowing, summer sowing, autumn planting, and profitable township enterprises, the supply and marketing cooperatives purchasing production materials—all of these need money. If spring and summer are not supported, what will be procured in the autumn? As a result, the Agricultural Bank is forced to operate with high leverage, borrowing a large amount of short-term funds to make up for the shortage of procurement funds. It is reported that from 1986 to 1988, the Agricultural Bank in Xiangfan borrowed an average of 102 million yuan from the People's Bank and other banks each year. The funds borrowed last year to redeem the "white slips" have not been repaid yet. Due to the tight procurement funds, in addition to severely cutting industrial loans, the Agricultural Bank in Xiangfan had to reduce spring plowing production loans by more than 50% compared to the same period last year.

Procurement funds are not only insufficient in total but also suffer from severe leakage. The Agricultural Bank's disbursement increases, while recovery decreases, and the turnover is very abnormal. In the first two quarters of this year, the total procurement of agricultural and sideline products in Xiangfan City was 5.6 billion yuan, but the Agricultural Bank only recovered 1.6 billion yuan in loans. The rest was largely delayed, blocked, occupied, and misappropriated by various parties at various levels.

Grain, cotton, and oil are important commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, and procurement funds must be guaranteed first. Therefore, some procurement departments boldly misappropriate procurement funds to build houses, buy cars, and make up for the funds that the financial department should allocate but did not. When the procurement season arrives, they cry out for help everywhere, even hanging up signs saying "The Agricultural Bank has no money." At this time, local governments step in to intervene, and the bank has no choice but to provide the funds. According to checks by the Agricultural Bank branches in six counties (cities and districts) including Xiangyang, the grain department alone misappropriated 305.8 million yuan in working capital loans for fixed asset investments in 1987; by the end of 1988, one-third of the procurement loans in the grain department of Xiangyang County were misappropriated. According to a survey by relevant departments, some grain procurement departments in Yicheng County, to avoid bank supervision, transferred 44.05 million yuan in procurement funds to three other specialized banks, some of which were even high-interest fixed-term deposits.

From the procurement of grain to the recovery of loans, there should be a reasonable time difference. However, now this "difference" is being stretched longer and longer, sometimes for several months, sometimes for half a year or a year, becoming a regular occupation. One important reason is that the management of funds for grain from the production area to the sales area is cut off in the middle. Most of the grassroots procurement departments below the county level have accounts in the Agricultural Bank, drawing loans from the Agricultural Bank, while most of the grain transfer and entry departments above the county level have accounts in the Industrial and Commercial Bank. These units' loans to be paid must be remitted back to the Agricultural Bank through the Industrial and Commercial Bank. The long chain has loopholes everywhere. After the products are transferred out, there are those who delay payment; those who give money but are occupied by the specialized bank that opened the account, top up the deficit, deduct and repay loans; and there are also cases where specialized banks mutually set up barriers, press remittances, return remittances, and intercept grain transfer funds.

The money for selling things is delayed in coming back, and the Agricultural Bank's occupied inter-bank remittance differences and short-term loans borrowed are also difficult to settle in time. In 1988 alone, Xiangfan Agricultural Bank was fined 1.58 million yuan for this.

This year, Xiangfan had a bumper harvest of rapeseed, and the summer oil procurement task has been completed without issuing a single "white slip" to the farmers; the funds for the summer grain contract procurement and the negotiated price conversion to the planned price have been secured, but there is still a gap for the negotiated price part; after the summer harvest, the autumn harvest will follow, and after getting through this year, what about next year?

Recently, the Agricultural Bank in Xiangfan City and its subordinate branches invited some experts and scholars from research and business departments in the provincial capital and Beijing to discuss the situation, find the root causes, and seek solutions, jointly studying the problem of agricultural and sideline product procurement funds. People discovered from the exchange that the practitioners have already done what they can:

- In the past two years, Hubei Province has implemented a system of hierarchical and departmental responsibility for procurement funds, which has been effective. Government departments take the lead, the People's Bank, the Agricultural Bank, other specialized banks, the financial department, and the grain department each take responsibility, layer by layer to ensure the implementation, and coordinate the arrangement of procurement funds;
- The Agricultural Bank in Xiangfan has begun to take measures to strengthen the supervision, management, and service of procurement enterprises. Funds are no longer supplied "openly," and management methods such as "scale control" are implemented, and assistance is provided to collect commodity funds;
- The city of Dangyang implements a "one-stick" management system for grain from procurement to sales, which greatly reduces the occupation of funds in settlements.

But there are also some problems that are beyond the Agricultural Bank's ability to solve and can only stay at the stage of "sitting and discussing." For example: calling on the central bank to fully consider the special nature of procurement funds as policy loans and include them in the currency issuance plan; calling for a normal financial order, strict settlement discipline, and ensuring smooth remittances; establishing a diversified procurement fund supply system, and specialized banks that extend their institutions to the countryside and organize deposits should share the supply of procurement funds in proportion; the state should issue special bonds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and raise funds from various sectors of society in a multi-channel manner for special use...

To get out of the predicament of procurement funds, if it is only to "cut flesh to fill wounds," treating the symptoms and not the root cause, there will be no way out. Only by working on reforming the system, rectifying the order, and straightening out the relationship can there be a solution.

### 收购资金的困境和出路

    收购打“白条”，伤农民心，损害政府威信，也困扰着农业银行。但是，收购牵涉到方方面面。我们不妨从襄樊的情况，看一看——
    收购资金的困境和出路
    本报记者　江夏
    今年，尽管局部地区遭了灾，但夏粮占湖北省一半以上的襄樊仍然是好年景。粮食到了手，可农民心里还是犯嘀咕，不晓得卖了粮，能拿到多少现钱。襄樊农行行长杨期友对此毫不含糊地回答：“今年我们下了决心，夏粮合同定购和议转平部分，或支付现金，或开转帐支票，完全随农民的意，坚决杜绝‘白条’。无论如何不能亏待农民。去年的教训够深刻的了。”勉　力　苦　撑
    说起去年的“白条”，行长们至今“心有余悸”。尽管各级农行四处奔波，东拆西借，最后，农民手里还是攥着5000万元左右的“白条子”，迟的今年5月份才兑现。有的农民几次兑不到现金，气愤地当场把条子撕掉。
    襄樊是多种农副产品的产区，近两年，筹措收购资金成了这个地级市农行上上下下的一块“心病”。有的支行正月十五吃过元宵就开始做准备。春茧、苎麻、茶叶、香菇都在四五月份上市，夏油、夏粮6月开始收获，此后烟叶、芝麻陆续登场，9、10月份，中稻还没收购完，棉花收购又压上来，部分粮、棉，直到转过年才全部入库。一年12个月当中，农行倒有10个月为此投入大量精力，忙得无喘息之机，收购资金已占到农行全部贷款的40％以上，他们自己戏谑地说，农业银行快成了“收购银行”了。
    农副产品收购资金，数额巨大，投放集中，由于收购量逐年增加，且价格渐升，收购资金需要量越来越大。1988年信贷紧缩之后，矛盾更为突出。按照现行资金管理体制，中央银行不包专业银行资金，专业银行的上级行不包下级行资金，因收购规模扩大而增加的收购资金，主要得由农行层层自求平衡，依靠新增存款解决。可是实际上农行却很难承受。到1988年底，南漳县农行存款比1985年底净增4145万元，增长近两倍，但同期农副产品收购贷款净上升6566万元。就是把新增存款全部用于农副产品收购，也满足不了需要。
    农行毕竟不是“收购银行”，新增存款也不能全部用于收购。春耕、夏种、秋播，效益好的乡镇企业，供销社购进生产资料，哪样不要钱？春夏不扶持生产，秋后收购什么？结果农行只好被迫高额负债经营，大量拆入短期资金，弥补收购资金的不足。据介绍，襄樊全市农行1986—1988年间，每年平均向人民银行及同业借入资金1.02亿元。去年为兑现“白条”而借的款，到现在还未还清。收购资金紧张，襄樊市农行除了狠压工业贷款外，今年春耕生产贷款不得不比去年同期减少50％多。多　方　拖　欠
    收购资金不仅总量不足，而且流失严重，农行投放增加，回笼减少，周转很不正常。今年前两季度，襄樊市调销农副产品总额5.6亿元，但农行只收回贷款1.6亿元，其他大部分被各方面在各个环节拖欠、堵截、挤占、挪用了。
    粮、棉、油是关系国计民生的重要商品，收购资金必须优先保证。于是，一些收购部门放心大胆地挪用收购资金盖房、买车、弥补财政应拨未拨款，把“硬缺口”甩给农行。收购旺季到来，就四处告急，甚至挂出“农行没钱”的牌子。这时自有地方政府出面干预，不怕银行不拿钱。据襄阳等6个县（市）区支行检查统计，1987年粮食部门仅挪用流动资金贷款，搞固定资产投资就达3058万元；1988年底，仅襄阳县粮食部门，就有1／3的收购贷款被不合理占用。另据有关部门调查，宜城县一些粮食收购部门，为逃避银行监督，居然把440多万元收购资金，转存其他三家专业银行，其中有少数还是定期高息的。
    从粮食调销出去到收回贷款，本来有一个合理的时间差，可是现在这个“差”拉得越来越长，少则数月，多则半载、一年，变成了一种经常性的占用。其中一个重要原因是，粮食从产区到销区，资金管理被拦腰截开，县以下基层收购部门大多在农行开户，从农行取得贷款，而县以上粮食中转和调入部门大多在工商行开户。这些单位承付的贷款要通过工商行汇划回农行。长长的链条，到处是空子。产品调出后，买方拖款者有之；买方给了钱，被开户的专业银行占用，顶汇差、补缺口、扣还贷款者有之；专业银行之间相互设卡、压汇、退汇、拦截粮食调销资金的也不乏其例。
    卖东西的钱迟迟收不回来，农行占用的联行汇差、拆借的短期贷款也难以及时结算，仅1988年襄樊农行就因此被罚款罚息158万多元。寻　求　出　路
    今年，襄樊油菜籽大丰收，现在夏油收购任务已经完成，没给农民打一张白条；夏粮合同定购和议转平部分资金虽已落实，但议价部分还有缺口；夏收过后，秋收将接踵而至，挺过了今年，明年会怎么样呢？
    襄樊市农行及其下属支行，最近从省城和北京，邀请了一些研究部门和业务部门的专家、学者，摆情况，找症结，想对策，共同研究农副产品收购资金问题。人们从交流中发现，实干家们已经把能做的事情做了起来：
    ——近两年湖北省实行收购资金分级分部门负责制，颇见成效，政府部门牵头，人行、农行、其他专业银行、财政以及粮食部门，各负其责，层层落实，统筹安排收购资金；
    ——襄樊农行开始采取措施，强化对收购企业的监督、管理和服务。资金上不再“敞口供应”，实行“规模控制”等管理方法，并协助其清收货款；
    ——当阳市实行粮食从购到销，归口农行的“一条鞭”管理，大大减少了结算中的资金占用。
    但也有一些问题，非农行一家的力量所能为，还只能停留在“坐而论道”的阶段。比如：呼吁中央银行充分考虑收购资金这一政策性贷款的特殊性，将其列入货币发行计划；呼唤正常的金融秩序，严肃结算纪律，保证汇路畅通；建立多元化的收购资金供给体系，在农村下伸机构、组织存款的各专业银行按比例分担收购资金的供应；国家专门发行农副产品收购债券，多渠道向社会各方面专项筹资、专项使用……
    要走出收购资金的困境，如果只是剜肉补疮，哪儿痛医哪儿，不可能有出路。只有在改革体制、整顿秩序和理顺关系上下功夫。
