Swedish and British research has proven that obese children are likely to grow into obese adults and face a 10-year reduction in lifespan, highlighting the need to start preventing heart disease in childhood.

Sweden began tracking over 500 obese children 40 years ago. The results showed that 55 of them had died, with men averaging a lifespan of 63 years and women 68 years. The mortality rate was two-thirds higher than the general population of the same age, and their average lifespan was 10 years shorter.

The primary cause of death among these individuals was cardiovascular disease. Among the more than 500 tracked, two-thirds had cardiovascular disease or other chronic illnesses like diabetes.

The Swedish study also indicated that obesity in children has genetic factors. Whether these children grow into obese adults appears to be related to the obesity levels of their grandparents and parents, particularly their mothers.

Mike Rayner, a senior researcher in the prevention of coronary heart disease in Britain, believes that heart disease actually begins at a very young age. If measures are taken during childhood, heart disease can be prevented.

It has been discovered that by the age of 5 or 6, children's arteries already have fatty streaks; by around 18 years old, fat starts to accumulate in the blood vessels. Therefore, preventive measures such as weight reduction should be taken early, as unhealthy diets can form habits in children that are difficult to change later.

In Britain, three-quarters of schoolchildren get more than 35% of their energy from fat. Among British obese individuals, 40% are men and 32% are women.

    瑞典和英国研究证明
    肥胖儿寿命短
    新华社伦敦8月27日电  （记者王国瑞）瑞典和英国的研究证明，肥胖儿童可能长成胖子，并有早死10年的危险，预防心脏病应从儿童抓起。
    瑞典在40年前开始跟踪研究500多名肥胖儿童。结果是，其中55人死亡，男子平均寿命63岁，女子平均寿命68岁。死亡率比总人口同年龄组高2／3，平均寿命比总人口短10年。
    这些人死亡最普遍的原因是心血管病。在被跟踪的500多人中，2／3的人有心血管病或糖尿病等其他慢性病。
    瑞典这项研究还证明，肥胖儿童有遗传因素。他们以后是否长成胖子，看来同他们的祖父母和父母，特别是母亲的肥胖程度有关。
    英国预防冠心病高级研究员迈克·雷纳认为：心脏病实际上在年龄很小时就开始了，如果在儿童时期就采取措施，就可以预防心脏病。
    已经发现，5—6岁儿童的动脉里有脂肪条纹；到18岁左右，血管里开始脂肪堆积。因此，应尽早地采取减肥等预防性措施，因为不健康的饮食使儿童养成习惯后再去预防就晚了。
    英国在校儿童的3／4从脂肪摄取的能量占35％以上。在英国的胖子中，男子占40％，女子占32％。
