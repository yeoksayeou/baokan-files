The market in Beijing before National Day will feature various exhibitions and sales of famous, high-quality, and new special products, as well as preferential sales events. At the same time, the retail enterprises of the First Commercial Bureau will extend their business hours by half an hour each day in September and October. A responsible person from the First Commercial Bureau recently revealed that these measures are taken, first, to facilitate the public's purchasing and enrich the market, and second, to make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and riots.

It is understood that in May and June of this year, the sales of the First Commercial System in Beijing were affected, resulting in a loss of 270 million yuan in sales and a reduction of 31 million yuan in profits. To make up for the losses, the First Commercial Bureau decided to continue organizing suitable goods sources and strive to reduce various expenses while doing everything possible to expand sales. In addition, efforts will be made to improve service attitudes and actively promote and increase sales.

Regarding the National Day market, the responsible person said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, and the capital's market should have a richer variety of goods and a better appearance than last year. Currently, arrangements have been made for 48 major holiday commodities, and an additional 200 million yuan in funds will be sought to enrich the market and activate the holiday atmosphere.

    北京一商系统扩大销售
    首都国庆市场将好于去年
    本报北京8月18日讯　记者潘岗报道：国庆节前的首都市场，将有各种名优新特产品展销、优惠酬宾展卖等活动。与此同时，9、10两月，一商局系统零售企业将每天延长营业半小时。市一商局负责人日前透露：采取这些措施，一是为了方便群众购买、丰富市场，二是为了夺回动乱、暴乱造成的损失。
    据了解，今年5、6两月，北京市一商系统影响销售达2.7亿元，减少利润3100万元。为挽回损失，市一商局决定在继续组织适销货源、努力降低各项费用开支的同时，千方百计扩大销售。另外，还要通过改善服务态度，主动推销、增销一些。
    谈到国庆节市场，这位负责人说，今年是建国40周年，首都市场要做到商品丰富多彩，面貌好于去年。目前，对48种主要节日商品已经作出安排，并再争取2亿元资金专项用于丰富市场、活跃节日气氛的货源。
