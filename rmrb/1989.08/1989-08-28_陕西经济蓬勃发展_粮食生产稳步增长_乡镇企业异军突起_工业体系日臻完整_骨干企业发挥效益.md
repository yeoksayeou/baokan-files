Shaanxi, one of the birthplaces of Chinese agriculture, has seen its agricultural production rapidly develop since the founding of New China, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The province's rural economy has begun to transition towards specialization, commercialization, and modernization. In 1988, the total social output value of the province's rural areas reached 20.05 billion yuan, nearly three times that of 1978. Grain production achieved a balance between procurement and sales, with surplus production. Tobacco leaves, fruits, tea, meat, eggs, milk, wool, cocoons, and other products all reached historical highs. With the development of the rural economy, farmers' living standards have significantly improved. The per capita net income of farmers in the province increased from 133 yuan in 1978 to 404 yuan in 1988.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, Shaanxi's grain production has increased from 3.31 billion kilograms in the early days of liberation to 9.82 billion kilograms in 1988. The average yield per mu has increased from 60 kilograms to 161 kilograms. In 1988, farmers in the province sold a total of 2.06 billion kilograms of contracted and negotiated grain to the state. The steady increase in grain production is due to several factors: the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, which has significantly boosted farmers' enthusiasm; improved production conditions, with the number of large, medium, and small reservoirs increasing from none in the early days of liberation to over 1,400 today, and the effective irrigated area reaching over 19 million mu; and the application of 32 kilograms of fertilizer per mu, up from 0.05 kilograms in the early days of liberation. Additionally, the promotion of practical technologies such as high-yield wheat varieties, plastic film corn, hybrid rice, and dryland farming techniques has also played a significant role in increasing grain yields. The industrial structure of rural areas has undergone significant changes, particularly since 1984, with township enterprises emerging as a pillar of the rural economy. By 1988, the total output value of township enterprises reached 10 billion yuan, surpassing the total output value of agriculture. 2.47 million workers formed over 500,000 enterprises, producing more than 6,000 types of products. Among these, 114 products won national awards and department-level excellence titles, 40 products won provincial-level excellence titles, and more than 60 products entered the international market, with an annual export value of 62 million yuan.

The rich inland region of China—Shaanxi—is basking in the spring breeze of reform and opening up, ushering in a new era of industrial prosperity.

In the 800-li Qin Basin, industries such as military, machinery, metallurgy, transportation, and building materials are thriving, forming a relatively complete industrial system. In the ancient city of Xi'an, textile cities, electronic cities, electrical cities, and aircraft cities have risen from the ground. In the loess plateau of northern Shaanxi and the mountainous regions of southern Shaanxi, energy industries such as coal and petroleum, as well as processing industries, are flourishing. Especially in the past decade of reform and opening up, the industrial front of the entire province has continuously improved the socialist enterprise operation mechanism, and production efficiency has been continuously improved. By the end of 1988, the total industrial output value had increased from 286 million yuan in the early days of the nation's founding and 9.648 billion yuan in 1978 to 33.174 billion yuan. Products are sold to more than 100 countries and regions both domestically and abroad.

Defense industry enterprises are roaring like tigers. Shaanxi's defense industry is an important national defense industrial production and research base, with 260,000 employees, over 80,000 technical personnel, and fixed assets (original value) of 5.4 billion yuan, second only to Sichuan Province and ranking second in the country. Since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, defense industry enterprises have leaped out of the small world of defense production and entered the main battlefield of modernization, developing over 670 types of civilian products. Among these, more than 70 types have filled domestic gaps, over 30 types have been listed as import substitution products, 27 types have won national gold and silver awards, and 101 types have won provincial and ministerial-level excellent product awards. The output value of civilian products has increased from 700 million yuan in 1979 to 1.38 billion yuan in 1988.

The textile industry is thriving. A relatively complete industrial system centered around cotton spinning, including wool, hemp, silk, chemical fiber, knitting, dyeing, textile machinery, and research, has been formed. In recent years, advanced equipment such as air-jet spinning and water-jet looms have been introduced, further boosting textile production.

Black gold flows abundantly underground. Shaanxi's coal-bearing strata cover about one-third of the province's area, with coal reserves ranking third in the country. Since the founding of New China, the province has successively built and expanded the four major coal mines of Tongchuan, Hanzhong, Chenghe, and Puba, making it one of the ten coal-exporting provinces in the country. Currently, the largest coal field in China, the Shenfu high-quality coal field, is being developed.

Aircraft manufacturing enterprises are taking off. Shaanxi's aviation industry has a core team of over 20,000 technical personnel, forming a complete aviation industry system. The province's capabilities in major aircraft systems, such as airframes, engines, power sources, navigation, and brakes, are at the forefront of the country. The Xi'an Aircraft Manufacturing Company has Asia's largest assembly workshop. The "Yun-7" aircraft developed by the Xi'an Aircraft Manufacturing Company is soaring on 65 domestic routes and 2 international routes. The company's production of the vertical tail for Boeing 737-300 aircraft and 20 components for Boeing 747 aircraft has won the praise of foreign customers.

The future of the electronics industry is bright. The electronics industry is a new and rapidly developing industry in Shaanxi, with a number of large and medium-sized backbone enterprises and flagship products that hold an important position in the country. It has made significant contributions to the launch of China's rockets, missiles, and experimental communication satellites. The integrated circuit research at the Lishan Microelectronics Company is at the forefront of the country. The Shaanxi Color Picture Tube Factory, with an annual production of 1.28 million color tubes, has won the national gold award for its "Caihong" brand picture tubes. The "Ruyi," "Yellow River," and "Sea Swallow" color televisions produced in Shaanxi all won first prizes in the 1988 national color television competition.

    陕西经济蓬勃发展
    粮食生产稳步增长  乡镇企业异军突起
    工业体系日臻完整  骨干企业发挥效益
    本报讯　陕西是我国农业的发源地之一。自古以来，勤劳的陕西人民，在“沃野千里”的关中平原、“渔米之乡”的汉中盆地和“卧马之地”的陕北高原从事农业生产。新中国成立后，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，陕西的农业生产迅速发展，农村经济开始向专业化、商品化、现代化转变。1988年，全省农村社会总产值达200.5亿元，比1978年增长近3倍。粮食实现了购销平衡、自给有余，烟叶、果、茶、肉、蛋、奶、羊毛、蚕茧等均创历史最高水平。随着农村经济的发展，农民生活得到极大的改善，全省农民人均纯收入由1978年的133元增加到1988年的404元。
    建国40年来，陕西粮食产量从解放初的33.1亿公斤提高到1988年的98.2亿公斤，平均亩产从60公斤增加到161公斤。1988年，全省农民交售给国家的定购、议购粮共达20.6亿公斤。粮食生产稳步增长，一是由于实行联产承包责任制，农民积极性空前提高。二是生产条件有了显著改善。解放初，全省没有一座水库，现有大、中、小水库1400多座，有效灌溉面积达1900多万亩。化肥施用量从解放初的每亩0.05公斤增加到现在的32公斤。三是推广了实用技术，小麦良种、地膜玉米、杂交稻、旱作技术等都对粮食增产起到促进作用。全省农村产业结构发生了重大变化，特别是1984年以来乡镇企业异军突起，已经成为农村经济的支柱。到1988年，乡镇企业总产值达100亿元，继续超过农业总产值，247万劳动力组成50多万个企业，生产6000多种产品，其中，114种产品获国家奖和部优称号，40种产品获省优称号，有60多种产品打入国际市场，出口年产品交货值达6200万元。

    本报讯　祖国富饶的内陆腹地——陕西，沐浴着改革开放的春风，迎来了她工业蓬勃发展的新时期。
    在八百里秦川，军工、机械、冶金、交通、建材等各业蓬勃发展，已形成较为完整的工业体系，在古城西安旧城垣四周，纺织城、电子城、电工城、飞机城拔地而起，在陕北黄土高原和陕南山区，以煤炭、石油等能源和加工业方兴未艾……特别是改革开放十年来，全省工业战线不断完善社会主义企业运行机制，生产效益不断提高。截至1988年底，工业总产值分别由建国初的2.86亿元和1978年的96.48亿元达到331.74亿元，产品销往国内各地和海外100多个国家和地区。
    军工企业如虎下山。陕西军工企业是国家重要的国防工业生产、科研基地，拥有26万名职工，各类科技人员8万多人，固定资产（原值）54亿元，仅次于四川省，在全国居第二位。“六五”以来，军工企业如猛虎下山，跳出军工生产小天地，投入四化建设的主战场，共开发各类民用产品670多种，其中70多种填补了国内空白，30多种被列为替代进口产品，27种获国家金质、银质奖，101种获省部优产品奖，民品产值由1979年的7000万元增长到1988年的13.8亿元。
    纺织工业蓬勃发展。现已形成了以棉纺为中心的毛、麻、丝绸、化纤、针织、印染、纺织机械、科研等配套比较完整的工业体系。近年先后引进了气流纺纱、喷水织机等先进设备，更使纺织生产如虎添翼。
    地下乌金滚滚涌流。陕西含煤地层面积约占全省幅员的1／3，煤炭储量居全国第三位。新中国成立以来，全省先后新建和扩建了铜川、韩城、澄合、蒲白四大统配煤矿，是全国十个煤炭调出省之一。现在我国最大储量的神府优质煤田正在开发。
    飞机制造企业正在腾飞。陕西航空工业拥有一支两万多名科技人员的骨干队伍，形成完整的航空工业体系。飞机的主要系统，如机体、发动机、电源、导航、刹车等专业配套能力居全国首位。陕西飞机制造公司拥有亚洲最大的总装车间。西安飞机制造公司研制的“运七型”飞机已翱翔在国内65条航线和2条国际航线上，该公司为美国波音公司生产的波音737—300飞机垂直尾翼和波音747飞机20项组合件深得外商的赞赏。
    电子工业前景广阔。电子工业是陕西近年来迅速发展起来的一门新兴工业，有一批大、中型骨干企业和“拳头”产品，在全国居于重要地位，曾为我国火箭、导弹和试验通讯卫星的发射作出了重要贡献。骊山微电子公司的集成电路研制居全国之首，年产彩管128万只的陕西彩色显像管总厂出产的“彩虹牌”显像管荣获国家金质奖；陕西生产的“如意”、“黄河”、“海燕”彩色电视机，在1988年全国彩色电视机评比中，均获一等奖。　（徐来见）
