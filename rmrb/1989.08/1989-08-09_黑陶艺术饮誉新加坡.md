This June was the Singapore Arts Festival, with artists from various countries gathering in the "Lion City" to showcase their skills. Chinese pottery artists from Shandong, Qiu Zhihai and his son Qiu Shisen, were invited by the Singapore Cultural Arts Association to participate in this grand event, displaying their research and creative works on the 4,000-year-old "Longshan Black Pottery."

The Black Pottery Art Exhibition was held on the first floor of the Raffles Hotel in the heart of Singapore, a luxurious high-rise building known as the first skyscraper in Asia and a center for political, cultural, and economic activities. Over a hundred pieces of black pottery art, each with unique shapes, were displayed in pristine showcases. Surrounded by floral arrangements from dignitaries and a large banner, the exhibits were even more captivating.

The exhibition's location was ideal, with visitors coming in from morning till night. They praised the Chinese black pottery craftsmanship, signing the guestbook and taking photos with the artists. An American couple commented, "Chinese people are so clever, two people can put on such a great exhibition, truly amazing!" A local Singaporean artist visited the exhibition three times, inspired by the excellent Chinese culture, and stayed up all night after the exhibition. He later bought a favorite piece for a thousand Singapore dollars.

After the exhibition, the Singapore Ministry of Culture held a ceremony to accept the donated items. The black pottery artworks will be permanently preserved as important artifacts in the Singapore Museum.

    黑陶艺术饮誉新加坡
    今年六月是新加坡文化艺术节，来自各国的艺术家云集“狮城”竞献技艺。中国山东陶塑艺术家仇志海、仇世森父子应新加坡文化艺术协会邀请，参加这一艺术盛会，在海外展出他们对四千年前“龙山黑陶”的研究创作成果。
    黑陶艺术展览设在位于新加坡中心的莱佛士大酒店一层大厅，这是一座高层豪华建筑，号称亚洲第一大厦，是新加坡政治、文化、经济活动的中心之一。形态各异的一百多件黑陶艺术陈列在洁白的展柜内，周围是各界知名人士送来的花篮，巨幅标语悬空，黑陶展品更显得魅力夺人。
    这次展览地点得天独厚，参观人员从早上到深夜络绎不绝，他们对中国黑陶工艺赞不绝口，纷纷在留言簿上签名，争相与作者合影留念。一对美国夫妇说：“中国人很聪明，两人能办这样好的展览，真了不起！”一位新加坡华人艺术家三次观展，为中国优秀文化所激动，他看后一夜未眠，展览结束后他以千元新币高价买下了如意展品。
    展览结束后，新加坡文化部举行仪式，接受赠品。黑陶艺术品将作为重要文物永久珍藏在新加坡博物馆。（济文）
