	Cases of theft and sabotage of communication lines have surged dramatically this year, posing a serious threat to the safety and smooth operation of China's communication networks. In some regions, communication has even been paralyzed. Today, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Supreme People's Court, and the Ministry of Public Security held a joint telephone conference. They demanded that local public security organs and postal and telecommunications security departments concentrate their efforts to severely crack down on and strictly punish criminals who sabotage communication lines.

	According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year, there were 1,674 cases of communication line sabotage nationwide, a threefold increase compared to the same period last year. Over 1.44 million meters of wires and cables were stolen, along with 668 poles, resulting in direct economic losses of 4.44 million yuan, nearly five times the amount from the same period last year. Sabotage of communication lines often leads to the disruption of communication in an entire province or a large region, and even international communication, severely interfering with the normal work and life of society and causing significant economic losses. On May 9th and 11th this year, the national first-class trunk line from Beijing to Lanzhou via Xi'an, Jiayuguan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang was sabotaged, causing the capital and other regions to lose communication with the northwestern regions for over 2,300 minutes, with very bad consequences.

	Today's conference deployed a focused campaign to crack down on criminal gangs specializing in theft and sabotage of communication lines. It will also conduct a comprehensive cleanup and rectification of scrap collection points in various regions, shutting down illegal operators. The conference also hopes that local authorities will do a good job of promoting community watch programs to prevent criminals from finding opportunities, thereby reducing the incidence of such cases.

    破坏通信线路案剧增
    邮电和公检法部门联合部署  要求各地严厉打击犯罪分子
    据新华社北京8月22日电　（记者李玫）今年以来，盗窃、破坏通信线路案件的急剧上升给我国通信安全畅通造成了严重威胁，有的地区甚至因此而通信瘫痪。邮电部、高检、高法和公安部今天联合召开电话会议，要求各地公安机关和邮电保卫部门要集中力量严厉打击，从严惩处破坏通信线路的犯罪分子。
    据不完全统计，今年上半年，全国共发生破坏通信线路的案件1674起，比去年同期增加3倍；被盗电线、电缆144万余米，电杆668根，直接经济损失444万元，比去年同期增长近5倍。通信线路被破坏，往往造成一个省或一个大区的通信甚至国际通信阻断，严重干扰社会正常的工作生活秩序，并使经济蒙受巨大损失。今年5月9日、11日两天，北京经西安通兰州、酒泉和青海、新疆的国家一级干线被破坏，使首都和其他地区通往西北地区的电路中断达2300多分钟，影响很坏。
    今天的电话会议部署了重点打击专门盗窃、破坏通信线路犯罪团伙的专项斗争，并将对各地的废品收购站点进行全面清理整顿，取缔一些非法经营者。会议还希望各地做好群众联防护线的宣传，使犯罪分子无机可乘，减少发案率。
