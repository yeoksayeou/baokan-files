Special Correspondent Guo Weicheng

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) — The fifth summit of Central American heads of state opened today in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

At 2:20 p.m., the presidents of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias; Guatemala, Marco Vinicio Cerezo; Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega; El Salvador, Alfredo Cristiani; and Honduras, José Simón Azcona, gathered at a makeshift venue by the pool of the "Tegucigalpa Mar" hotel to meet with journalists from around the world. They accepted the honorary title of "distinguished guests" and a symbolic wooden key to the city from the mayor of Tegucigalpa, marking the official opening of the summit. The five presidents then began a tense, secret meeting. According to the resolution of the fourth summit held on February 14, this meeting was originally scheduled for May 15. Due to the presidential election in El Salvador and other reasons, the date was changed several times before finally opening today. This is the first time that El Salvador's new president, Alfredo Cristiani, is attending the Central American summit.

It is understood that the main agenda of this meeting is for the five countries to formulate a joint plan to disband the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces currently stationed in Honduras with U.S. support; to review the implementation of the Central American peace agreement; and to politically evaluate the various achievements made so far. Other topics on the agenda include the economic situation and foreign debt in Central America, eradicating drug trafficking, and establishing a Central American parliament. Honduras Foreign Minister Luis López predicted that the meeting would "make some progress" and said that the meeting would discuss the issue of the Salvadoran guerrillas. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega revealed upon his arrival that he had met with the leader of the Salvadoran guerrillas and brought a letter from the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front of El Salvador to the presidents of the Central American countries. Ortega expressed his support for the Salvadoran guerrillas' suggestion in the letter to negotiate with the government.

About 500 journalists from various countries have arrived in Tegucigalpa to cover this summit.

    中美洲第五次首脑会议开幕
    讨论中美洲和平进程等问题
    本报特拉（洪都拉斯）8月5日电　记者郭伟成报道：中美洲第五次首脑会议今天在洪都拉斯的特拉开幕。
    下午2点20分，哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯、危地马拉总统塞雷索、尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加、萨尔瓦多总统克里斯蒂亚尼、洪都拉斯总统阿斯科纳一起来到设在“特拉玛尔”旅店游泳池边的简易会场与来自世界各国的记者们见面；接受了特拉市长向他们宣布的“荣誉贵宾”称号与象征性的木制城门钥匙，首脑会议宣告开幕。随后，五位总统开始紧张的秘密会议。根据今年2月14日第四次首脑会议的决议，这次会议本应在5月15日举行。由于萨尔瓦多大选换届及其它种种原因，几易会期，终于在今天开幕。萨尔瓦多新总统克里斯蒂亚尼是第一次出席中美洲首脑会议。
    据悉，这次会议的中心议题是五国制订一个共同计划，遣散目前驻扎在洪都拉斯境内、得到美国支持的尼加拉瓜反政府武装部队；检查中美洲和平协议的执行情况；对已经取得的各项进展作政治评价。列入议题的还有中美洲经济形势与外债，根除贩毒及组建中美洲议会等传统问题。洪都拉斯外长洛佩斯预言会议将会“取得一些进展”，并说会议将讨论萨尔瓦多游击队问题。尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加在抵达此地时透露，他曾会见了萨尔瓦多游击队领导人，并带来了萨尔瓦多游击队法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线给中美洲各国总统的信。奥尔特加表示，他赞成萨尔瓦多游击队在信中建议与政府进行的谈判。
    大约500名各国记者赶到特拉采访这次首脑会议。
