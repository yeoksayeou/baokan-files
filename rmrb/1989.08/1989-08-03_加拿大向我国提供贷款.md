Canada Provides Loan to China

Our reporter Guo Wenfu reports from Ottawa: The Canadian federal government recently approved a loan of 100 million Canadian dollars to China. The loan will be used to purchase Canadian communication equipment. This is the first loan approved by the Canadian government to China since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing.

According to reports, this decision was made during a routine cabinet meeting last week. The loan was proposed by Minister of External Trade Crosby and will be provided to the Bank of China through the Export Development Corporation of Canada.
