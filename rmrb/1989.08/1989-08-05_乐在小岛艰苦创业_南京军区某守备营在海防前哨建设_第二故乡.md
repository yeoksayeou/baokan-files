Soldiers of a garrison regiment of the Nanjing Military Region stationed at the forefront of the East China Sea consider guarding the small island as their "second home." They have been transforming the face of their second home with their own hands, earning the approval and praise of Yang Baibing, Director of the General Political Department, who inscribed: "Contribute to building a good second home for soldiers."

The island where this regiment is stationed is far from the mainland and close to international waters, with an area of just over 2 square kilometers. The environment is harsh, with no flat ground and no clear skies for three days at a time. Heavy rain, strong winds, and thick fog often "lock" the small island, forcing ships to stop sailing and cutting off transportation, causing many inconveniences for the soldiers' lives.

Over the years, the regiment's leadership has persistently educated the troops on hard work and frugality, inspiring all soldiers to learn from the older generation of island guards and lead by example in hard work, dedicating their youth to their second home. Under the leadership's exemplary influence, the regiment's officers, despite facing various difficulties, have been able to handle them correctly. Some young officers, due to being isolated on the island, have had trouble finding partners; some, although they have found partners, face difficulties in meeting and communicating, affecting their emotional exchanges; some officers have devoted all their time and energy to building the company, and after being married for three or four years, have only spent a few months together, to the point where their children do not recognize them as "father"; some officers, due to long-term work on the island, have developed rheumatism and other island-related illnesses, but they still deeply cherish their island company. For the sake of the company's construction, many officers have repeatedly given up opportunities to work in larger island headquarters, finding joy in hard work and entrepreneurship on the island.

In the past, the regiment's vegetables mainly relied on purchasing from outside the island. Crossing the sea to buy vegetables once, the vegetables were expensive, and sometimes encountering waves, they could not return for ten days or half a month, forcing the officers and soldiers to rely on soy sauce soup for their meals. The regiment decided to grow their own vegetables to increase the self-sufficiency rate. They dug out more than 50 plots of "shoe sole fields" and "palm-sized lands" from the cracks in the mountains and between the rocks, ranging from a few square meters to over 20 square meters, planting green vegetables, lettuce, cauliflower, cabbage, celery, chili peppers, eggplants, and other seasonal greens. The island is windy, so they brought stones from the mountains to build windbreaks around the vegetable fields.

The soldiers used their labor income to successively purchase electric fans, cupboards, install dining tables, and build a military entertainment center with 14 projects including chess, ball games, music, books, television, and video.

They used their own hands to beautify the island's environment, making their second home more charming. The soldiers built the "Youth Road," cultivated the "Youth Fields," planted the "Youth Forest," and created the "Seaside Park" and other ten scenic spots on the island.

In June of this year, the party committee of a certain unit on the East China Sea frontline forwarded the deeds of this garrison regiment to its subordinate units, calling on all soldiers to learn from them, carry forward the spirit of hard work, love the island and the grassroots, and strive for entrepreneurship and progress.

### 乐在小岛艰苦创业——南京军区某守备营在海防前哨建设“第二故乡”

    乐在小岛艰苦创业
    ——南京军区某守备营在海防前哨建设“第二故乡”
    南京军区驻守在东海最前哨的某守备营官兵，把守卫小岛当作“第二故乡”，用双手改变着第二故乡的面貌，受到了总政治部主任杨白冰的肯定和赞扬，并为他们题词：“为建设好军人的第二故乡作贡献”。
    这个营驻守的这个小岛，远离大陆，紧靠公海，面积只有2平方公里多一点，环境艰苦，岛上地无三尺平，天无三日晴。暴雨、狂风和大雾，经常“锁”住小岛，迫使航船停驶，交通断绝，给官兵生活带来了很多不便。
    多年来，这个营领导坚持不懈地对部队进行艰苦奋斗、艰苦朴素的教育，启发全营官兵向老一代守岛人学习，并带头艰苦奋斗，带头把青春献给第二故乡。在领导模范作用的带动下，守备营的干部虽然遇到了各种各样的困难都能正确对待，有的年轻干部由于偏居小岛，一直找不到对象；有的虽然找了，但因和女朋友见面难，通信也难，影响了感情交流；有的干部把时间和精力都花在连队建设上，结婚三四年，夫妻团聚的时间只有几个月，以致孩子见了面也不肯喊“爸爸”；有的干部由于长期在小岛工作，得了风湿性关节炎等海岛病，但他们仍然深深地留恋自己的小岛连队。为连队建设，不少干部多次放弃了到大岛机关工作的机会，乐在小岛基层艰苦创业。
    过去，守备营吃菜主要靠出岛购买。飘洋过海买一次菜，菜贵不说，有时遇上风浪，十天半月回不来，干部战士只好靠酱油汤下饭。营里决定自己种菜，提高蔬菜的自给率。他们在山缝中、石块间抠出了50多块“鞋底田”、“巴掌地”，大者20多平方米，小者几平方米，种上了青菜、莴苣、花菜、卷心菜、芹菜、辣椒、茄子等，四季常青菜。岛上风大，他们从山上运来石头，在菜地旁筑起了一堵堵挡风墙。
    官兵们用自己的劳动收入，先后添置了电风扇、碗橱，装了餐桌面，建起了有棋类、球类、音乐、图书、电视、录相等14个项目的军人娱乐中心。
    他们用自己的双手，美化小岛环境，使第二故乡更具魅力。官兵们在岛上修筑“共青路”，开垦“共青田”，栽种“共青林”、“海滨公园”等十大风景点。
    今年6月，东海前哨某部党委向所属部队转发了这个守备营的事迹材料，号召全体官兵学习他们发扬艰苦奋斗精神，热爱海岛、热爱基层，艰苦创业，开拓前进。
