Medical workers from the Guizhou Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Station have spent seven years investigating and have confirmed that hemorrhagic fever is primarily prevalent in the mountainous regions of Guizhou. The disease predominantly affects middle-aged individuals, with a higher incidence in males compared to females.

The medical workers began their investigation of this disease in 1982, covering all 86 counties and cities in the province. They have successfully identified the distribution patterns, characteristics, affected areas, host animal species, and human infection status of hemorrhagic fever, completing the investigation two years ahead of the national schedule.

Hemorrhagic fever is a naturally occurring infectious disease for which there is currently no effective treatment or prevention method. Consequently, it has a high incidence and mortality rate. Guizhou Province is one of the regions in China with a high incidence of hemorrhagic fever. Recently, the epidemiological research findings on hemorrhagic fever in Guizhou Province have passed expert evaluations. Relevant experts believe that these research findings provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of this infectious disease in Guizhou Province.

    贵州医务人员七年努力  查清流行性出血热疫情
    新华社贵阳8月14日电　（记者刘扬深）贵州省卫生防疫站的医务人员经过7年调查研究，确认流行性出血热在贵州主要流行于山区，多发病于壮年人，男性又多于女性。
    医务人员从1982年开始调查这种病，足迹遍及全省86个县市，终于查清了流行性出血热的分布规律、特征、疫区范围、宿主动物种类和人群感染情况，提前两年完成了国家规定的调查任务。
    流行性出血热是一种自然疫源性疾病，至今尚无特效的药物和防治办法，所以发病率和病死率都比较高。贵州省又是我国流行性出血热高发地区之一。最近，贵州省流行性出血热流行病学研究成果通过了专家鉴定。有关人士认为，这一研究成果为贵州省防治这种传染病提供了科学依据。
