Recently, we visited the Xinzi Mountain Forestry Station in Yishui County, Shandong Province, and observed that many pine trees were infested with caterpillars about an inch long. Some pine trees had been eaten to the point where only bare branches remained. According to the county forestry bureau, there are 11,000 acres of state-owned pine forests in the county that have been similarly affected by pests. If timely measures are not taken to control the pests, these pine forests will be destroyed by the caterpillars.

Due to a lack of funds, there is currently no solution for pest control. We appeal to relevant departments to assist the state-owned forestry stations in Yishui County in resolving the current difficulties as soon as possible.

    毛虫吞噬万亩松林　缺资少药林场无策
    最近，我们在山东沂水县辛子山林场看到，不少松树上爬着许多寸余长的松毛虫，有的松树已被蚕食得剩下光秃秃的枝干。据县林业局介绍，全县像这样受虫害的国营松林达1.1万亩。若不及时防治，这些松林将毁于毛虫之口。
    由于资金不足，防治虫害目前尚无着落。呼吁有关部门帮助沂水县国营林场尽快解决眼下困难。
