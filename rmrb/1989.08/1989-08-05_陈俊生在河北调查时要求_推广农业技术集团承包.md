State Councilor Chen Junsheng recently pointed out during an investigation of agricultural issues in Hebei that agricultural technology group contracting is an important path to accelerate agricultural development and is a beneficial attempt at deepening agricultural reform and achieving agricultural modernization through science and technology. Areas with the necessary conditions can promote this approach according to local conditions, while further investigating and summarizing the contracting forms to gradually improve them.

Hebei Province is one of the earliest provinces to implement agricultural technology group contracting with notable results. This year, Yi County contracted 27,000 mu of cotton through technology group contracting. Two county leaders took the lead, organizing the agricultural, science and technology commission, planning commission, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments with 57 people to form a contracting group that signed a contract with the county government. The contract includes economic benefit indicators and reward and punishment measures. The contracting group is responsible for technical training, technical guidance, and various services before, during, and after production.

Chen Junsheng said, agricultural technology group contracting has at least three advantages for agricultural production. First, it is conducive to the promotion of agricultural technology. An important way to increase China's grain production is to rely on science and technology, focusing on improving agricultural labor productivity, increasing the yield per unit area of crops, and effectively utilizing resources. Agricultural technology group contracting precisely finds a suitable form for the combination of scientific and technological research with agricultural production practice, enabling agricultural new technologies to be rapidly promoted and shortening the promotion cycle. Moreover, the application information of agricultural new technologies is promptly fed back to the scientific research departments, promoting the development of scientific research. Second, technology group contracting is led by administrative leaders and involves multiple departments, multiple disciplines, and multiple levels of joint contracting. It can coordinate the relationships among various aspects, reduce contradictions, and work together, ensuring that agricultural production has reliable guarantees in terms of technology, funds, and materials. This is a good method that does not change the conventional management system but can effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of various departments to jointly focus on agricultural production. Third, technology group contracting is a good form for various levels of leaders to pay attention to agricultural production and is a way to strengthen agricultural leadership.

    陈俊生在河北调查时要求
    推广农业技术集团承包
    新华社北京8月5日电　国务委员陈俊生日前在河北调查农业问题时指出，农业技术集团承包是加快农业发展的重要途径，是深化农业改革、实现科技兴农的有益尝试。有条件的地方可以因地制宜地推广这一做法，同时对承包形式进一步调查总结，使之逐步完善。
    河北省是开展农业技术集团承包较早、效果突出的省份。今年，易县对27000亩棉花进行了技术集团承包，两位县领导牵头，组织农业、科委、计委、供销等部门57人组成承包集团与县政府签订合同。合同包括经济效益指标和奖惩办法等内容。承包集团负责技术培训、技术指导，产前、产中和产后的各项服务。
    陈俊生说，农业技术集团承包对农业生产至少有三点好处：第一，有利于农业技术的推广。提高我国粮食产量的一条重要出路就是紧紧依靠科学技术，在提高农业劳动生产率，提高农作物单位面积产量和有效利用资源上下功夫。而技术集团承包恰恰为科学技术与农业生产实践的结合找到了适宜的形式，使农业新技术得以迅速推广，推广周期大大缩短。而且农业新技术应用的信息及时反馈到科研部门，又促进了科学研究的发展。第二，技术集团承包是由行政领导牵头组织多部门、多专业、多层次的联合承包，它可以协调各方面的关系，减少矛盾，相互配合，使农业生产在技术、资金、物资等投入上都有了可靠的保证。这是一种不改变常规管理体制，又能很好调动各部门积极性，共同抓好农业生产的好办法。第三，技术集团承包是目前各级领导重视农业生产的一种好形式，是一种强化农业的领导行为。
