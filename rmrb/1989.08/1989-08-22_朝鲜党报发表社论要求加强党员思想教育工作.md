	North Korea's party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, published an editorial today calling on all levels of leadership to strengthen ideological education for party members and the masses.

	The editorial states that vigorously conducting ideological work has always been a principle upheld by the Korean Workers' Party. It is necessary to further improve and strengthen the party's ideological work according to the development of the revolutionary cause and the current situation. Currently, an important aspect of the party's ideological education work is to make party members and the masses deeply understand the superiority of the socialist system, so that they have a sense of pride and confidence in the socialist system and resolutely defend it. At the same time, they should love their own nation, possess a lofty revolutionary spirit and national independence spirit, and selflessly struggle for the prosperity of the country and the nation.
