For a long time, a small number of stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization have repeatedly promoted the idea of implementing an American-style system of tripartite separation of powers in China. Some people in society also have a vague understanding of the tripartite separation of powers system and its economic, political foundations, especially its class nature. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the tripartite separation of powers system and clarify why China cannot follow the path of tripartite separation of powers but must adhere to the People's Congress system.

The Essence of Tripartite Separation of Powers is the Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie

Tripartite separation of powers, also known as the separation of powers, is a political system widely practiced in Western capitalist countries. Its main content is that the legislative, administrative, and judicial powers of the state are separately exercised by the parliament, government, and courts, respectively, while the three powers also mutually constrain each other, attempting to maintain a balance of power and prevent the abuse of power or the concentration of power leading to tyranny.

During the long process of the bourgeoisie's opposition to feudal autocracy, due to the different national conditions, the specific forms of tripartite separation of powers are varied. The United States adopts a "presidential system" where the Congress, President, and Supreme Court are independent and mutually check each other. Britain, Japan, and other countries adopt a "parliamentary cabinet system" where the cabinet is responsible to the parliament. Of course, in practice, each country's tripartite separation of powers system has been continually adjusted to adapt to the needs of the ruling class. For example, after World War II, although the United States still adheres to the principle of separation of powers and checks and balances, the administrative power represented by the President has gradually expanded, while the power of Congress has relatively weakened.

Tripartite separation of powers abolished the highly centralized autocratic system of feudal monarchs, replacing it with a system of separation of powers among the state's legislative, administrative, and judicial powers. It broke the feudal patriarchal bloodline rule, replacing it with elected government officials, which is conducive to preventing individual autocracy and the restoration of the autocratic system, maintaining the overall rule of the bourgeoisie over the state. The bourgeoisie's tripartite separation of powers system is a negation of the feudal autocratic system and has a certain historical progressiveness. Tripartite separation of powers is an upper structure produced on the basis of capitalist private ownership. The free competition and anarchic state of capitalist commodity economy necessarily require the breaking of autocracy and privilege, the implementation of separation of powers and checks and balances, in order to continuously adjust the contradictions and conflicts among different interest groups within the bourgeoisie, consolidate the rule of the bourgeoisie. While tripartite separation of powers can, to some extent, meet the requirements of "interest balance" within the ruling class, avoiding the danger of a single group or a few leaders seizing power and endangering the overall interests and rule of the bourgeoisie. As the organizational form of the bourgeoisie's political power, the essence of the tripartite separation of powers system is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat and the broad masses of working people. Behind the seemingly fair and reasonable tripartite separation of powers, the true master is the bourgeoisie's political party. The bourgeoisie, through its representative parties, controls the majority of seats in the parliament, actually manipulating the legislative power; through the head of the ruling party serving as the President or Prime Minister, actually controlling the administrative power; and through the appointment of the Chief Justice or judges of the Supreme Court by the President or Prime Minister, actually influencing the judicial power. It is through the control of the three powers by the parties representing its interests that the bourgeoisie consolidates its class rule.

In fact, tripartite separation of powers is not as perfect as some people claim. First, tripartite separation of powers often leads to mutual restraint and sabotage among the various power centers, seriously affecting the normal operation of the state machine. Bourgeois representatives in the parliament, in order to protect the interests of the groups they represent, engage in endless debates, often making it difficult to decide on major issues, even leaving them unresolved for a long time, causing the government's operations to be sluggish and inefficient. For example, the annual budget review by the U.S. Congress sometimes fails to pass due to disputes over shares among different regions or interest groups, forcing government departments to rely on temporary appropriations from Congress or temporarily suspend operations. Second, tripartite separation of powers does not, as some people describe, play a balancing role in various decisions, avoiding mistakes. For example, the "Gulf of Tonkin Resolution" passed by the U.S. Congress in 1964 at the proposal of President Johnson led to the direct U.S. intervention in Vietnam, escalating the Vietnam War. This not only seriously undermined international peace but also plunged the United States into a quagmire of war and internal and external difficulties, facing strong criticism from both domestic and international society. Furthermore, the so-called "checks and balances" is not, as some people exaggerate, an effective mechanism to curb the corrupt behavior of government officials. The Western political system based on money is itself a breeding ground for corruption, which determines that cases of using power for personal gain, bribery, and corruption are rampant. It can be seen that the tripartite separation of powers system has its inevitable class limitations. The idea of treating tripartite separation of powers as a panacea for all power crises is extremely naive and childish.

The Political System of Tripartite Separation of Powers Cannot Work in China

Different economic bases determine different superstructures. As mentioned above, the private ownership of capitalism has produced a corresponding tripartite separation of powers political system. However, the main body of China's economy is the socialist public ownership of the means of production, that is, state ownership and collective ownership by the laboring masses. Although with the deepening of economic system reform, China's diverse ownership economy has developed, the position of socialist public ownership as the mainstay has not changed and will not change. The reality of socialist public ownership of the means of production in China necessarily requires the establishment of a socialist political system that represents the interests of the entire people and unifies the exercise of state power, rather than copying the bourgeois tripartite separation of powers system. Marxist classics have always held a negative attitude towards the tripartite separation of powers system when discussing the new type of state organization of the proletariat, believing that it is contradictory to the unity of state power. Marx, in summarizing the experience of the Paris Commune, pointed out that the proletarian dictatorship should not be parliamentary in nature but should unify the exercise of state power.

The establishment of what kind of political system is determined by the nature of the state, that is, the class nature of the state. The Chinese Communist Party, leading the Chinese people through a long revolutionary struggle, thoroughly smashed the state machine of the exploiting classes and established a socialist state of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Due to the elimination of the exploiting classes and the system of exploitation, the inherent contradictions and conflicts between capital and labor in capitalist society, as well as the contradictions and conflicts within the ruling class, no longer exist. The fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in the country are consistent. This determines that there is no class basis for the bourgeois tripartite separation of powers system to exist in China. The state nature clearly stipulated in the Constitution of China requires that the political system must ensure that the people truly become the masters of the state and society. To achieve this goal, China can only adopt the People's Congress system as its fundamental political system. The People's Congress system implements the principle of democratic centralism, which is centralized on the basis of democracy. The people, through various levels of People's Congresses, unify the exercise of state power. The National People's Congress is the highest state power organ, which not only exercises the legislative power of the state but also produces and supervises the state administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs. The administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs are responsible to the People's Congress and are supervised by it. They, under the premise of the unified exercise of state power by the People's Congress, have a division of labor and work in a coordinated manner. This is fundamentally different from the mutual restraint and confrontation of the three major state organs that separately exercise legislative, administrative, and judicial powers under the bourgeois tripartite separation of powers system.

The tripartite separation of powers system and the bourgeois multiparty system are Siamese twins. This is because the so-called parliamentary democracy of the bourgeoisie is realized through the multiparty system or different factions of a party. Such parties or factions are actually the faithful spokesmen of different interest groups within the bourgeoisie. The national conditions in China are fundamentally different from those in the West. More than half a century of historical experience has proven that the Chinese Communist Party is the core force leading our cause. In China, in addition to the Communist Party in the leading position, there are other democratic parties that have long coexisted and cooperated with it, which is fundamentally different from the multiparty rotation in power in Western countries. The multiparty cooperation system led by the Communist Party is historically formed and accepted by all democratic parties. In the 40 years since the founding of the country, various democratic parties and the Chinese Communist Party have shared honors and disgrace, worked together in harmony, and continuously pushed the socialist cause forward. Practice has proven that the interests of the Chinese Communist Party and the interests of the entire people, including the interests of various democratic parties, are completely consistent. The Chinese Communist Party has no special interests other than the fundamental interests of the people. This eliminates the theoretical and practical basis for multiparty rotation in power and the emergence of factions representing different interest groups within the party, thus determining that China cannot copy the tripartite separation of powers and multiparty rotation in power system of the West.

Adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party, adhere to the People's Congress system, and the Communist Party realizes its political leadership over state affairs through the People's Congress system. The people, through the various levels of People's Congresses elected by themselves, unify the exercise of state power and decide on state affairs according to the principle of democratic centralism. Implementing such a fundamental political system is a historical choice made by the Chinese people in their long-term revolution and construction. From Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's promotion of constitutional monarchy to Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the bourgeois democratic revolution, how many patriots and scholars have painfully groped in the dark, seeking the truth of saving the country and the people from the West, and repeatedly attempted to oppose feudal autocracy and transform China according to the theory of tripartite separation of powers. But their attempts all ended in failure. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once pointed out profoundly that to regard the tripartite separation of powers system as a "long-term stable plan" is not to be trusted, and if copied to China, the evils are difficult to remove and the consequences are even worse. History has proven that the bourgeois tripartite separation of powers political system is not feasible in China.

Adhere to the Implementation of the People's Congress System

Our country is a socialist state of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. All state power belongs to the people. This state nature of people's democratic dictatorship, when reflected in the form of state power organization, requires an organ that guarantees the unified exercise of state power by all the people. The Constitution of China stipulates: The organ through which the people exercise state power is the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at various levels. That is to say, state power (including legislative power, decision-making power on major issues, supervisory power, and important personnel appointment and removal power, etc.) can only be exercised unitarily by the People's Congresses elected by the people. On this basis, the powers of the state administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs are clearly defined, so that the state organs can each perform their duties and work in a coordinated manner. The correct use and gradual improvement of this form of power organization can prevent the excessive concentration of power, avoid the various drawbacks of the tripartite separation of powers system, and can take the advantages and strengths of decision-making democratization and scientification and improve work efficiency.

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party summarized the historical experience since the founding of the country, especially the painful lessons of the "Cultural Revolution," and made the strategic decision to develop socialist democracy and improve socialist legal system, putting the improvement of the People's Congress system on the important agenda. In the past decade, the People's Congress, as the state power organ, has played an increasingly important role in the political life of the state and has achieved visible progress and achievements. The legislative work of the state has made significant progress, and a socialist legal system with the Constitution as the basis has been initially formed; the People's Congress has strengthened the supervision of the administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs according to law; it has further improved the rules and procedures for the people to exercise state power and has focused on the organizational and institutional construction of the People's Congress itself. This has played an important role in promoting reform and opening up and socialist modernization, consolidating and developing a stable and united political situation. Of course, there are still some problems with the work of the People's Congress at present, and the role of the state power organ has not been fully played. But this is not caused by the People's Congress system itself, nor can it be used as an excuse to copy the tripartite separation of powers system of the West. A small number of people advocating bourgeois liberalization have vigorously promoted the copying of the tripartite separation of powers system in China, which is essentially to replace the People's Congress system with the parliamentary democratic system of the bourgeoisie; to negate the leadership of the Communist Party with the multiparty system of the bourgeoisie.

The essence and core of socialist democratic politics is that the people are the masters of the country. Striving to improve the People's Congress system is an important part of China's political system reform. With the deepening of political system reform, it is necessary to further clarify the relationship between the Party committee, the People's Congress, and the government; to improve the supervision system of the People's Congress and make it legalized; to improve the composition of the people's representatives and enhance the quality of the people's representatives; to continue to strengthen the construction of the People's Congress itself. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out incisively: "In political system reform, one thing can be affirmed, that is, we will adhere to the system of the People's Congress, not the American-style tripartite separation of powers system." As long as we adhere to this correct direction and work hard, we will be able to better guarantee the people's right to be the masters of the country and build a higher and more practical democratic politics than Western countries.

    中国不能走三权鼎立的道路
    金建
    长期以来，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，一再鼓吹在中国实行美国式的三权鼎立的政治制度。社会上有一些人也对三权鼎立制度及其赖以建立和发展的经济、政治基础，特别是阶级实质不甚了解，存在模糊认识。因此，有必要对三权鼎立制度作些考察，弄清我国为什么不能走三权鼎立的道路，而必须坚持实行人民代表大会制度。
    三权鼎立的实质是资产阶级的阶级专政
    三权鼎立也称三权分立，是西方资本主义国家普遍实行的一种政治制度。其主要内容是，国家的立法、行政、司法三种权力分别由议会、政府、法院独立行使，同时三者又相互制约，试图以此维持权力间的制衡，防止走向滥用权力或集权专制的道路。
    在资产阶级反对封建专制的漫长过程中，由于各国的国情不同，三权鼎立的具体形式也五花八门。美国采取的是国会、总统、最高法院彼此独立、相互制衡的“总统制”。英国、日本等国则采取内阁对议会负责的“议会内阁制”。当然，在实践中各国的三权鼎立制度为适应统治阶级的需要还不断变换调整。如第二次世界大战以后，美国虽然仍坚持分权与制衡的原则，但在三大权力之间的运作上，以总统为代表的行政权力日趋扩大，国会权力则相对削弱。
    三权鼎立废除了封建君主高度集权的专制制度，代之以国家立法、行政、司法三权的分权制度。它打破了封建宗法血缘统治，代之以选举产生的政府官吏，有利于防止个人专断与专制制度的复辟，维护整个资产阶级对国家的统治。资产阶级的三权鼎立制度，是对封建专制制度的否定，有着一定的历史进步性。三权鼎立是在资本主义私有制经济基础上产生的上层建筑。资本主义商品经济的自由竞争和无政府状态，必然要求打破专制和特权，实行分权与制衡，以便不断调节资产阶级内部不同利益集团的矛盾及冲突，巩固资产阶级的统治。而三权鼎立就在一定程度上可以满足统治阶级内部各派“利益均衡”的要求，避免个别集团或少数领导人专权而危及资产阶级的整体利益和统治。作为资产阶级政权的组织形式，三权鼎立制度的实质，是资产阶级对无产阶级及广大劳动人民的专政。在貌似公正合理的三权鼎立背后，真正起主宰作用的是资产阶级政党。资产阶级通过代表自己利益的政党控制议会中的多数议席，实际操纵立法权；通过执政党首脑人物出任总统或首相，实际掌握行政权；又通过由总统或首相任命最高法院院长或法官，实际影响司法权。资产阶级正是通过代表其利益的政党控制三大权力来巩固它的阶级统治的。
    其实，三权鼎立并不像极少数人吹嘘的那样完美无缺。首先，三权鼎立往往会造成各个权力中心之间的互相掣肘拆台，严重影响国家机器的正常运转。资产阶级议员们为维护各自所代表的集团利益在议会喋喋不休地争论，往往使一些重大问题议而难决，甚至长期搁置，政府的运作也因此迟滞不灵，效率低下。例如，美国国会一年一度的政府财政预算审议，有时因不同地区或利益集团互争份额而使预算法案迟迟不得通过，政府有关部门只好靠国会临时拨款度日或被迫暂停上班。其次，三权鼎立并不像有人描绘的那样，可以在各项决策中起制衡作用，避免失误。如1964年美国国会根据总统约翰逊提议而通过的“东京湾决议”，导致美国直接出兵越南，扩大侵越战争，这不仅严重破坏了国际和平，也使美国深陷战争泥潭和内外交困的境地，遭到国内朝野和国际社会的强烈抨击。另外，所谓“以权力制约权力”也并非像某些人渲染的那样，是遏制政府官员腐化行为的有效机制。以金钱为基础的西方政治制度本身便是产生腐败的温床，这就决定了以权谋私、贪赃枉法、行贿受贿等案件屡禁不止。由此可见，三权鼎立制度有其不可避免的阶级局限性。那种把三权鼎立看作是包医权力危机百病的万应灵药的想法，是极为天真幼稚的。
    三权鼎立的政治制度在我国行不通
    不同的经济基础决定不同的上层建筑。如上所说，资本主义的私有制产生了与之相适应的三权鼎立的政治制度。而我国经济的主体是生产资料的社会主义公有制，即全民所有制和劳动群众集体所有制。尽管随着经济体制改革的深入，我国的多种所有制经济有所发展，但社会主义公有制为主体的地位没有也不会改变。我国生产资料的社会主义公有制这一现实，必然要求建立一种代表全国人民利益的、统一行使国家权力的社会主义政治制度，而不能照搬资产阶级三权鼎立的制度。马克思主义经典作家在论述无产阶级新型的政权组织形式时，一向对三权鼎立制度持否定态度，认为它同国家权力的统一是相矛盾的。马克思在总结巴黎公社的经验时肯定地指出，无产阶级政权不应当是议会式的，而应当是统一行使国家权力的。
    建立什么样的政体，要由国体也就是国家的阶级本质来决定。中国共产党领导中国人民经过长期的革命斗争，彻底打碎了剥削阶级的国家机器，建立了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。由于消灭了剥削阶级和剥削制度，资本主义社会中固有的资本与劳动的对立，以及统治阶级内部不同利益集团之间的矛盾和冲突已不复存在，全国各族人民的根本利益是一致的。这就决定了在我国没有资产阶级三权鼎立制度赖以存在的阶级基础。我国宪法明确规定的这种国体，要求国家的政体必须保证人民真正成为国家和社会的主人。为了实现这一目的，我国只能以人民代表大会为根本政治制度。人民代表大会实行民主集中制的原则，在民主的基础上实行集中，人民通过各级人民代表大会统一行使国家权力。全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关，它不仅行使国家立法权而且产生和监督国家行政、审判、检察机关。行政、审判、检察机关对人大负责，受人大监督。它们在人民代表大会统一行使国家权力的前提下，既有分工，又协调一致地进行工作。这同资产阶级三权鼎立制度下分别行使立法、行政、司法权力的三大国家机关的互相牵制和抗衡，有着本质的区别。
    三权鼎立制度和资产阶级多党制是暹逻双胞胎。这是因为资产阶级的所谓议会民主，是通过多党制或一个政党的不同派系出面实现的。这样的政党或派系，实际上是资产阶级内部不同利益集团的忠实代言人。我国的国情与西方根本不同。半个多世纪的历史经验证明，中国共产党是领导我们事业的核心力量。在我国，除了处于领导地位的共产党外，还存在与之长期共存、互相合作的其他民主党派，这同西方国家的多党轮流执政是根本不同的。共产党领导的多党合作制是历史形成并为各民主党派所共同接受的。建国40年来，各民主党派和中国共产党荣辱与共，和衷共济，不断把社会主义事业推向前进。实践证明，中国共产党的利益和全体人民的利益，包括各民主党派的利益是完全一致的。中国共产党除了人民的根本利益之外，没有自己的任何特殊利益。这就排除了多党轮流执政以及党内出现代表不同利益集团的派别的理论和实践根据，从而决定了我国决不能照搬西方的三权鼎立和多党轮流执政的制度。
    坚持共产党的领导，坚持人民代表大会制度，共产党通过人民代表大会制度实现其对国家事务的政治领导，人民通过由自己选举产生的各级人民代表大会统一行使国家权力，按照民主集中制的原则决定国家事务。实行这样的根本政治制度，是中国人民在长期革命和建设中作出的历史性选择。从康有为、梁启超推行的君主立宪到孙中山领导的资产阶级民主革命，多少仁人志士在黑暗中痛苦摸索，向西方寻找救国救民的真理，多次试图按照三权鼎立的学说来反对封建专制，改造中国。但他们的尝试都以失败而告终。孙中山先生曾经深刻指出，把三权鼎立制度说成是“长治久安之计，那是不足信的”，如照搬到我国，流弊难除，恶果更甚。历史已经证明，资产阶级三权鼎立的政治制度在中国是行不通的。
    坚持实行人民代表大会制度
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。国家的一切权力属于人民。这种人民民主专政的国体反映到国家政权组织形式上，就要求有一个保障全体人民统一行使国家权力的机关。我国宪法规定：人民行使国家权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。这就是说，国家权力（包括立法权、重大问题决定权、监督权、重要人事任免权等）只能由民主选举产生的人民代表大会统一行使。在这个前提下，又明确划分了国家行政、审判、检察等机关的职权，从而使国家机关各司其职，协调一致地工作。这种政权组织形式的正确运用和逐步完善，既可以防止权力的过分集中，又可以避免三权鼎立制度的种种弊端，能够兼取决策民主化、科学化与提高工作效能的优势和长处。
    党的十一届三中全会总结了建国以来的历史经验，特别是“文化大革命”的沉痛教训，作出了发展社会主义民主、健全社会主义法制的战略决策，把完善人民代表大会制度提到重要议事日程上。十年来，人民代表大会作为国家权力机关，在国家政治生活中发挥了越来越大的作用，取得了有目共睹的成绩和进步。国家的立法工作取得了重大进展，初步形成了以宪法为基础的社会主义法律体系；人民代表大会依法加强了对行政、审判、检察机关的监督；它进一步完善了代表人民行使国家权力的规章和程序，抓紧了自身的组织建设和制度建设。这对于推进改革开放和社会主义现代化建设，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，都起了重要的保障作用。当然，目前人民代表大会的工作还存在着一些问题，国家权力机关的作用还没有更好地发挥出来。但这并不是人民代表大会制度本身造成的，更不能作为照搬西方三权鼎立制度的借口。极少数搞资产阶级自由化的人大肆鼓吹在中国照搬三权鼎立那一套，其要害就在于：以资产阶级的议会民主制取代人民代表大会制度；以资产阶级的多党制来否定共产党的领导。
    社会主义民主政治的本质和核心是人民当家做主。致力于人民代表大会制度的完善，是我国进行政治体制改革的重要内容。随着政治体制改革的深入进行，需要进一步理顺党委、人大、政府的关系；健全人大的监督制度并使之法律化；改善人民代表构成，提高人民代表素质；继续加强人民代表大会的自身建设。邓小平同志最近精辟地指出：“在政治体制改革方面，有一点可以肯定，就是我们要坚持实行人民代表大会的制度，而不是美国式的三权鼎立制度。”只要我们遵循这个正确的方向扎扎实实地工作，不断完善人民代表大会制度，就一定能更好地保障人民当家做主的权利，建立起比西方国家更高、更切实的民主政治。
