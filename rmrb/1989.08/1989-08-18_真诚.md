Sincerity
Yixigao

Scholars, though outwardly modest, harbor a certain wildness within. I visited the First Brigade of the Oil Construction Company in the Central Plains Oilfield and met the brigade's Party Secretary, Wang Changhong. As he spoke about their brigade's recruitment of 10 contract workers, he unconsciously deviated from his modest demeanor, and the wildness within him overflowed onto his face, plain for all to see.

Sitting in his office, he enthusiastically offered "Xinyang Maojian" tea. The vibrant green tea leaves floated up and down in the transparent glass cup, filled with emotion. The aroma of "Maojian" tea rose with the steam, exuding an inviting fragrance. Although the snow outside had not yet melted into trickling streams, the room was filled with the scent of spring. He said that this year, the company had given them a heavier task, but there was a surprising shortage of manpower. When he said this, his tone was calm, and there was no exaggeration in his expression, as if the increased workload was perfectly normal, not even a hint of the phrase "whipping a fast horse."

Not for the present, but for next year, the year after, the year after the year after, and the year after that... Thinking long-term, they decided to recruit 10 more contract workers from society. However, this time, the contract workers they recruited were different from those in the past; they were not hired for manual labor but to learn skills. Isn't society full of vocational schools? Students have to pay a considerable amount of tuition, and they have to take care of their own food and lodging. The contract apprentices they recruited, on the other hand, received wages and bonuses. The news spread, and the entire brigade's workers wanted their relatives to be the first to apply.

However, people also had a lot to say. The topic boiled down to one point: This gives the leaders another good opportunity to open the back door.

Facing this noise, Wang Changhong did not condemn the workers for their loose tongues from a high position. The social atmosphere was indeed a bit hard to praise, though not as bad as people said. Since it exists in society, why not let people talk? The problem is to use facts to correct people's terrible prejudices.

They decided to conduct an exam and select the best candidates.

Indeed, they conducted a closed-book exam with sealed test papers. The supervisors included worker representatives, union and political work cadres, and security personnel. The papers were graded on the same day. The scores were posted, and the answer sheets were made public for anyone to review at any time. The examiners, who were notified at the last minute, were "protected" until after the exam before being "released." The strictness was no less than that of the national college entrance exam.

The exam results selected 10 candidates from the highest to the lowest scores.

I suddenly remembered how I came to know Wang Changhong. He was originally the Party Office Director of the Oil Construction Company. Perhaps the leadership intended to cultivate him, so they removed him from his position as Party Office Director and sent him to the grassroots for training. As soon as he arrived at the First Brigade, he showed his organizational talent. Not to mention the transformation of the First Brigade's base from a "muddy courtyard" into an environment suitable for workers to work and live safely, healthily, reasonably, and civilly; not to mention effectively solving the employment of workers' wives and sons, and the issues of tickets, housing, and vegetable baskets (people said they were "five successes"); just this time, recruiting contract apprentice workers...

Just as I was thinking about this, an old worker came in. He looked tired, with bloodshot eyes and wrinkles filled with worry on his face, obviously having had a sleepless night.

"Changhong!" The old worker called his name affectionately, like an elder, without flattering him as Secretary Wang.

Seeing someone come in, our conversation naturally stopped. I casually picked up the tea cup, it was hot, I blew on it, and the tea surface rippled.

"Changhong, I... I..." The old worker stammered.

Because the exam had just ended, he sensed that something might have happened. Was someone coming to expose a cheater in the exam? There had been an announcement of a rule: if someone was found to have cheated, even if they were selected, they would be disqualified. Of course, the informant's identity would be kept secret.

"Changhong, I..." The old worker mustered his courage, "I made a mistake!"

Wang Changhong was taken aback! But the look he gave was still encouraging and trusting, not alert and scrutinizing.

"Sigh!" The old worker sighed heavily, hitting his head hard, "I was completely confused!"

Wang Changhong did not rush him, waiting patiently.

"I thought this exam was just a show for people to see. I was afraid of being tricked again, so I asked someone to take the exam for me... I didn't expect you to be serious this time, not deceiving us workers. I have to be honest..."

After hearing the old worker's self-reproach, Wang Changhong did not criticize or scold him. The wildness within him turned into a joyful smile. With the most heart-touching words, he warmly comforted him.

Perhaps it was because they had tasted the sweetness, they did everything with great sincerity, thus winning the trust of the vast number of workers. No wonder in 1988, their entire brigade completed a construction volume of 41 million yuan, with an average of 80,000 yuan per person (the state stipulated 15,000 yuan), far ahead of the rest of the country in the same industry.

Now, Wang Changhong works smoothly. With a heart full of aspirations, a heart full of plans, and a heart full of joy, he needs to sort it out and savor it carefully.

    真诚
    易希高
    念书人虽然表面谦抑，内心也有一份狂狷。我到中原油田油建公司一大队去，见到该大队的党委书记王场宏，他谈起他们大队招收10名协议工的时候，下意识地违反了他谦抑的性格，内心的那份狂狷，漫溢到了脸上，一览无余。
    坐在他的办公室里，他热情地冲上“信阳毛尖”。色彩嫩绿的茶汁在透明的玻璃杯里感情饱满地上下浮动，“毛尖”的香味随着蒸气腾腾上升，透出阵阵诱人的清香。外面的积雪虽然还没有化作涓涓清泉，室内却充满了春的气息。他说，今年公司给他们大队下达的任务又重了，而人手出奇的短缺。说这话的时候，语气平和，也没有夸张的表情，好像加重任务是很正常的，连那么一点说鞭打快牛的意味也没有。
    不是为目前，而是为明年、后年、大后年、大后年的大后年……长远着想，他们决定又面向社会招收10名协议工。只是，这次招收的协议工和以往招收的协议工不同，不是干粗活，而是学技术。社会上不是到处开办什么职业学校吗？入学者要交纳数目不少的学费，食宿还需自理。他们招收的协议学徒工，恰恰相反，还有工资、奖金发。消息一传开，全大队职工都想自己的亲戚捷足先登。
    但是，人们也议论纷纷。议题归纳到一点：又给领导一个开后门的良好机会。
    面对这烦喧，王场宏没有居高临下地指责职工们嘴短舌长。社会风气委实有点不敢恭维，虽然不像人们传说的那样可怕。既然是社会存在，怎么不让人家说话呢？问题在于，要用事实来纠正人们可怕的偏见。
    他们决定，通过考试，择优录取。
    也真叫真，搞闭卷考试，还是密封卷。监考者有工人代表和工会、政工干部，保卫部门也去了人。当天阅卷。分数张榜公布。答卷公开，可供人随时翻阅查对。临时通知的出题人一直“保护”到考试完后才“释放”出来。严格的程度，不亚于国家的高考。
    考试结果，从高分往低分择优录选了10名。
    我油然地想起是怎么认识王场宏的来。他原是油建公司的党办主任。也许是领导有意培养他，卸去了他党办主任的职务，把他放到基层去锻炼。他一到一大队，又锋芒毕露出组织才干。且不说改造了一大队基地的“泥浆大院”，建设成为一个适于职工能安全、健康、合理而文明地进行劳动和生活的环境；也且不说有效地解决了职工们的妻子、儿子的就业，和票子、房子、菜篮子问题（人们说他们是“五子登科”）；单是这次招收协议学徒工……
    正想到这儿，进来了一位老工人。他神情疲惫，眼里布满了血丝，脸上的皱纹间堆积着忧郁，显然昨晚上严重地失眠了。
    “场宏！”老工人长辈般地亲切地叫着他的名字，没有恭维地称他王书记。
    见到来了人，我俩的谈话自然中止了。我油然地端起茶杯，烫，吹吹，茶水面上打起了皱纹。
      “场宏，我……我……”老工人嗫嚅着。
    因为刚考试完，他敏感地意识到似乎出了点什么事。是不是来揭发考试中的舞弊者？曾经宣布过一条规定，一旦发现有人做了手脚，即使录取上班了，也得除名。当然得替检举者保密。
    “场宏，我……”老工人鼓足勇气，“我犯了错误！”
    王场宏不禁一惊！但是送过去的目光仍然是鼓励和信任，不是警觉与审视。
    “唉！”老工人沉重地叹了口长气，使劲地捶了一下自己的头，“我浑透了！”
    王场宏没有催促他，耐心地等待着。
    “我以为，这次考试也不过是做个样子给人看的。我怕又被耍了，所以请人代考……没想到，你们来了真格的，不是欺骗我们工人。我得凭良心……”
    听了老工人的自责，王场宏没有批评、教训。内心的狂狷，化作了欣喜的微笑。用最能打动人心的话，热情安抚他。
    也许是食髓知味吧，他们一件事一件事都干得十分真诚，因而赢得了广大职工的信任。难怪1988年，他们全大队完成建设量4100万元，人均8万元（国家规定是1.5万元），在全国同行业中遥遥领先。
    如今，王场宏工作得得心应手。满心的抱负，满心的构想，满心的快乐，得好好整理细细品味。
