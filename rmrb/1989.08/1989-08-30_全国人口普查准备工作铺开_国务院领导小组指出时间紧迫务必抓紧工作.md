Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th.

On the afternoon of August 29th, the State Council's Fourth National Census Leading Group held its second meeting. The meeting was chaired by State Councilor and Chairman of the State Council's Fourth National Census Leading Group, Li Tieying. Members of the leading group attended the meeting.

The meeting noted that since the State Council's Fourth National Census Leading Group held a teleconference on July 25th, the census preparation work has been fully launched nationwide. Currently, the population census leading groups and their offices in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have been established, and leading group meetings have been held to deploy local census work. The trial census work in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities will be carried out in September and October of this year. The meeting believed that the progress of census preparation work in various places is smooth, but there are imbalances in development, and work must be further accelerated.

After discussion, the meeting approved the "Measures for the Fourth National Census," which will be implemented after approval by the State Council. According to the census measures, the standard time for the Fourth National Census is 00:00 on July 1, 1990. There are only 306 days left until this standard time, and all preparatory work is very urgent and must be expedited.

According to the census measures, this census will use the principle of registering permanent residents, and each person needs to be registered in their permanent residence.

This census has a total of 21 items. Compared to the Third National Census in 1982, to reflect the changes in population migration since the deepening of economic reforms, two migration items have been added.

At the meeting, Comrade Li Tieying emphasized the need to do a good job in mobilizing social forces and propaganda and education on census and population awareness, and to improve the household registration and management work in prefecture-level and above cities through the census.

    全国人口普查准备工作铺开
    国务院领导小组指出时间紧迫务必抓紧工作
    新华社北京8月30日电  8月29日下午，国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组召开第二次会议。会议由国务委员、国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组组长李铁映主持，领导小组成员出席了会议。
    会议认为，7月25日国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组召开电话会议后，全国各地的人口普查准备工作已经全面展开。目前，全国30个省、自治区、直辖市人民政府人口普查领导小组及其办公室相继成立，并召开了领导小组会议，部署了当地的人口普查工作。各省、自治区、直辖市的人口普查试点工作将于今年9、10月间普遍展开。会议认为，各地的人口普查准备工作进展是顺利的，但发展不平衡，应进一步抓紧工作。
    通过讨论，会议通过了《第四次全国人口普查办法》，这一办法待报国务院审批后将颁布实行。根据普查办法规定，第四次全国人口普查的标准时间是1990年7月1日零时。今天距这个标准时间只有306天了，各项准备工作是十分紧迫的，必须抓紧进行。
    根据普查办法规定，这次普查采用按常住人口登记的原则，每个人都需在常住地进行登记。
    这次人口普查的项目共有21项，同1982年第三次全国人口普查比较，为了反映经济改革深入开展以来我国人口的迁移变化情况，增加了两个迁移项目。
    会上，李铁映同志强调要做好社会力量的动员和人口普查、人口意识的宣传教育工作，并要求通过人口普查搞好地级以上城市的户口整顿和户口管理工作。
