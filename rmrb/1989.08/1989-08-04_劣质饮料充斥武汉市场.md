Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 4th.

In the hot summer of Wuhan, various inferior beverages are rampant in the market. It is revealed that out of 91 soda production companies applying for new production and product qualification certificates, 36 were found to be substandard. Among these, 20 companies had both substandard production conditions and products.

Since June, reporters have found that in various crowded places such as train stations, docks, cinemas, dance halls, and swimming pools in the city, many individual vendors sell beverages that are mostly unbranded inferior sodas and expired drinks. Some large supermarkets and grocery stores sell boxed and bottled beverages like soy milk and orange juice, some of which have long passed their expiration dates, and some do not even have expiration dates marked. Some stores also alter the expiration dates on the bottom of cans to pass off inferior products as good ones.

According to the reporters' understanding, the main reason for the rampant inferior products in the Wuhan beverage market is the issue with the production companies, in addition to some sales units involved in the problem.

    劣质饮料充斥武汉市场
    据新华社武汉8月4日电  （记者熊金超）盛夏武汉，各种劣质饮料在市场上泛滥成灾。据透露，全市91家申请换发生产及产品合格证的汽水生产厂家，有36家不合格，其中生产条件和生产产品均不合格的厂家多达20家。
    6月以来，记者在市区各车站、码头、电影院、舞厅、游泳场等人群集中的活动场所发现，一些个体商贩出售的饮料大多是没有商标的劣质汽水和过期饮料。少数大型商场和副食品商店出售的豆奶、橙汁等盒装、瓶装饮料，有的早已过了有效期，有的连有效期都没有注明；有的商店还涂改了易拉罐底部的有效期，以次充好。
    据记者了解，武汉饮料市场之所以劣质商品泛滥成灾，除了部分销售单位从中做了一些手脚外，主要原因是生产厂家的问题。
