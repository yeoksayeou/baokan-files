Shahe City Government Proactively Accepts Supervision

The People's Daily reports: The government of Shahe City, Hebei Province, has been seriously handling proposals from the People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), proactively accepting supervision, promoting clean and diligent governance among government officials, and strengthening the relationship between the government and the people.

This year, the Shahe City Government has addressed issues such as unclear responsibilities, procrastination, and poor quality in handling proposals and motions from the past. The government decided to establish proposal handling groups in various departments. A total of 78 handling groups have been established across the city to handle 144 proposals and motions.

The Shahe City Government has established systems and procedures for handling proposals and motions. For proposals and motions transferred to the city government by the People's Congress and the CPPCC, they are categorized and sorted, and a tracking and handling card is filled out in triplicate. One copy is sent to the handling unit, one is kept by the tracking unit, and one is sent to the government's supervising leader. For major proposals and motions related to the city's reform and construction, a tracking system is implemented to ensure they are implemented and take effect as soon as possible. During the handling process, coordination between different departments is emphasized to avoid disputes.

The government has made the handling process public and accepted supervision. The city government has publicly displayed the content of the proposals and motions from the People's Congress representatives and CPPCC members, as well as the handling units and personnel, in the government's public affairs column. The handling results are also made public, increasing the transparency of the proposal handling work.
