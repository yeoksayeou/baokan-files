A year ago, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, in order to push the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement through the parliament, repeatedly emphasized how beneficial the agreement would be for the development of Canada's economy. One of the main points was that the implementation of the agreement would eliminate all obstacles for Canadian businesses to invest in the United States—a market ten times larger than Canada's. A year later, as more and more Canadian businesses began to invest in the United States, many experts found that the resulting changes were not as optimistic as people had originally imagined.

One of the main reasons attracting Canadian businesses to invest in the United States is that the investment environment in the United States is far superior to that in Canada. Canadian businesses can "spend less and achieve more" when investing in the United States. The executive director of an electrical company in Toronto, Steiger, said: "I can build a building in the United States for $10 million, but in Canada it would cost $100 million or more." Some businesses invest in factories in the United States and then sell the products back to Canada. It is estimated that this year, Canadian businesses will earn $41 billion through investments in the United States. Due to many factories that originally produced goods for export to the United States moving to the United States, coupled with the declining market conditions for automobiles in the United States, the export of Canada's main export products to the United States, automobiles and their parts, has been severely affected, leading to a decrease in the trade surplus. The surplus for the first quarter of this year was $2.8 billion, a 27% decrease from the same period in 1987.

At the same time, the growth rate of the Canadian economy is slowing down. The fiscal budget for 1989-1990, published in April, estimated the economic growth rate for this year to be 3%, while the economic growth rate from 1983 to 1987 was 4.3%, the highest among the seven major industrialized countries in the West, and 3.8% in 1988, second only to Japan. Canadian economic experts attribute this situation to the influence of the U.S. economy. Anthony Burke, editor-in-chief of the Montreal Bank Credit Analyst magazine, said: "We are the tail, and the United States is the dog. The tail cannot wag the dog."

Since exports to the United States account for 75% of Canada's total exports, the huge trade and fiscal deficits in the United States in the next two years will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the growth of the Canadian economy. This background for the development of the Canadian economic situation will undoubtedly encourage more businesses to turn to investing in the United States, and the flow of Canadian funds to the United States will in turn weaken the development of the domestic economy, forming a vicious cycle.

Some economists in both Canada and the United States who are cautious about this situation believe that if Canadian businesses continue to turn to investing in the United States, it will not only seriously affect the Canadian economy, leading to increased unemployment and a decline in living standards, making the long-standing budget and labor cost problems faced by the Canadian government even more complex. More seriously, it will also affect Canadians' attitude towards the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, bringing trouble to the Progressive Conservative Party government that has worked hard to pass the agreement.

Peter Moritz, a Canadian business expert at the University of Maine, emphasized: "The real danger is that the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will be blamed for bringing many problems to Canada's economic structure."

    加拿大：南下投资热的隐忧
    丁刚
    一年前，加拿大进步保守党为使加美自由贸易协定在议会通过，曾反复宣传这一协定对发展加拿大经济如何有利。其中主要的一项就是，协定的实施将消除加拿大厂商向美国——一个比加拿大大10倍的市场——投资的所有障碍。一年后，当越来越多的加拿大厂商开始把资金投向美国时，不少专家发现，由此引起的一系列变化并不如人们原来想象的那么乐观。
    吸引加拿大厂商南下的重要原因是，美国投资环境远比加拿大优越。加厂商在美国投资可以“少花钱，多办事”。多伦多一家电器公司执行总裁斯特杰说：“我在美国花100万美金就可以建一座楼，在加拿大则要花1000万或更多。”有些厂商在美国投资建厂，把生产的产品返销加拿大。据估计，今年加厂商通过在美投资将获利410亿美元。由于许多原先生产对美出口商品的工厂迁移美国，再加上美国汽车市场行情看跌，严重影响了加拿大对美主要出口产品汽车及其配件的出口，因而导致对美出口顺差减少。今年第一季度顺差为28亿美元，比1987年同期减少了27％。
    与此同时，加拿大经济的增长速度正在放慢。今年4月公布的1989—1990年度财政预算估计本年度的经济增长率为3％，而1983年至1987年加拿大经济增长率为4.3％，居西方七个主要工业国之首，1988年为3.8％，仅次于日本。加拿大经济专家将此种状况归咎于美国经济的影响。蒙特利尔《银行信贷分析家》杂志总编辑安东尼·伯克说：“我们是狗尾巴，美国是狗，尾巴是摇不动狗的。”
    由于对美国出口商品额占加拿大总出口额的75％，所以今后两年美国的巨额外贸和财政赤字仍将大大影响加拿大经济的增长。加拿大经济形势发展的这一背景无疑将促使更多的厂商转向美国投资，而加拿大资金流向美国反过来又会削弱本国经济的发展，从而形成恶性循环。
    对此状况持谨慎态度的加美两国的一些经济学家认为，如果加拿大厂商继续转向美国投资，不仅会使加拿大经济受到严重影响，造成失业率增加，生活水平下降，使长期以来加拿大政府头痛的预算和劳动力价格问题更加复杂。更为严重的是，它还会影响加拿大人对加美自由贸易协定的态度，给为通过这一协定作出努力的执政的进步保守党政府带来麻烦。
    美国缅因大学加拿大商业专家彼得·莫瑞茨强调：“真正的危险是，加美自由贸易协定将会因为给加拿大的经济结构带来许多问题而受到指责。”
