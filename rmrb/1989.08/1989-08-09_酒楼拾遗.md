With the opening up and reform, all industries are thriving, and the most bustling places are the restaurants and teahouses.

The development of the economy has given rise to restaurants and teahouses. People in the Pearl River Delta all say that restaurants are places for socializing, windows for information, and gates to wealth. Once managers step into a restaurant, a deal can be struck with a single clap, and once procurement personnel sit at a table, business information can flow to the four seas. Once businesspeople clink glasses, wealth can roll in from the three rivers. With hearts content and faces flushed, they speak in classical Chinese, leisurely and happily as if in a fairyland.

“People live to eat, and officials eat first.” The feasting in restaurants and teahouses is not just for common people, beggars, and ragpickers; even high-ranking officials and low-level clerks are feasting, regardless of how loudly superiors issue orders. The restaurant business is booming and shows no signs of waning. All kinds of delicacies and specialties are displayed on the tables. With guests filling the seats and strange and unusual conversations flying, they devour the food like a whirlwind, wipe their greasy mouths, and leave triumphantly. Even the biggest and smallest “imperial edicts” cannot stop that greedy mouth, and the wind of gluttony is blowing everywhere!

At the intersection of a small town, there are two restaurants, one to the north and one to the south. In the 1970s, both were state-run guesthouses. In the early 1980s, when the trend of economic liberalization was popular, the northern restaurant hired a team from Macau to renovate, spending tens of millions of yuan to make it luxurious and brand new. Even just looking at the facade, people couldn't help but praise it, saying, “A first-class restaurant with ultra-modern standards.” The manager of the northern restaurant changed several times before it was finally leased out. The lessee, Manager A, had a large nose, thick eyebrows, smooth skin, a big mouth, and a face full of good fortune, dressed in a suit and leather shoes. The employees called him “Money Manager.” Money Manager had a knack for business, pursuing profit with boundless flexibility. Whether it was cigarettes or alcohol, customers could get receipts from the restaurant for whatever they bought, and the amounts could be inflated. The restaurant made money, and the staff had perks to enjoy, benefiting both ends. They manipulated the receipts, evading taxes on banquets. As Manager A put it, “There are policies from above, and countermeasures from below. You have laws, and I have strategies.” Indeed, the restaurant was always full, with guests coming in droves.

The employees' income was naturally generous, with bonuses given to the point of sweetness and gifts given to the point of laughter. The manager's income was even more, and everyone was proud and content, making outsiders both envious and admiring.

Now, let's talk about the southern restaurant. Manager B, over 50 years old, had been in charge for over 20 years. He had a smiling face, a set of standard old routines, an ordinary appearance, and simple attire, with no extravagance or flamboyance. The restaurant didn't bother with renovations, just repainted the walls and tidied up a bit, maintaining a face that was neither luxurious nor rustic.

He managed the southern restaurant's business, sticking to the orthodox way. The northern restaurant overcharged by issuing multiple receipts to evade taxes, and the “working meal” of four dishes and one soup was served on oversized plates. He just didn't get it, issuing receipts for whatever was eaten, adhering to the standards set by the “red-headed” documents, and the “working meal” was not oversized four dishes and one soup. Overcharged banquets were not split into multiple receipts, and taxes were paid according to regulations. Relying on low prices, fresh ingredients, credibility, practicality, and enthusiastic service to attract customers, of course, it was mainly doing business with familiar units and ordinary citizens, with income just enough to get by. Sometimes, the high income of the northern restaurant would reach Manager B's ears, and the employees would often complain, saying he was inflexible and “as rigid as an iron plate.” But he still insisted on his old ways. “What kind of flexibility is there in corrupt practices?”

No one expected that soon, higher authorities would indeed issue documents to clean up corruption, oppose “official profiteering,” and begin rectification. The good times didn't last long, and the northern restaurant really had to suspend operations for rectification. People from the disciplinary committee, supervision bureau, tax bureau, and industrial and commercial bureau came, as well as police, prosecutors, and court officials, constantly questioning. The investigation made everyone anxious, the accounts were rumpled, Manager A was dejected, the financial personnel were sweating, and the employees were “mumbling.”

“Those who evade taxes must pay back!” “Those who inflate receipts must be fined!” “The tens of millions of unreasonable bonuses must be returned!” The higher authorities' decisions were made one after another. The employees were greatly demoralized, and customers became fewer and fewer each day, each blaming their parents, cursing heaven and earth. People said, those who act lawlessly and do as they please will never pass.

However, the manager of the southern restaurant sat steady in his “fishing boat,” with business always stable. The campaign to clean up corruption continued to deepen, and corrupt practices were curbed. Party discipline and social ethics improved, and the southern restaurant's customers not only increased but also its reputation rose. Manager B said, I knew that such practices could not spread and continue. The employees said, it's still our manager's idea that's good, with strict controls and proper business practices.

This time, the handling of the northern restaurant made people clap their hands in approval and discuss enthusiastically. “It seems that this time, from the central to local authorities, there is a firm resolve to oppose corruption,” “Those who do not rely on the right path will fall,” and so on.

I felt a bit guilty. In recent years, I have done a lot of reception work, and I have eaten with superiors and been treated by subordinates. This time, when I walked into the southern restaurant, seeing the enthusiastic Manager B and the attentive service staff, I added a few more respects in my heart. When the standard “working meal” of four dishes and one soup was served, I seemed to see the scenes of the superior-subordinate relationship and the harmonious relationship between people unfolding before my eyes. I seemed to have gained something. Ah, isn't it? The excellent tradition of sharing weal and woe with the people and the glorious tradition of the superior and subordinate being in step, which had been lost for so long, wasn't it retrieved in the southern restaurant?

    酒楼拾遗
    何德桓
    开放改革，百业俱兴，生意兴旺热闹起来的可数酒楼茶馆了。
    经济的发展，酒楼茶馆应运而生，珠江三角洲的人都说，酒楼是交际楼、信息窗、致富门。经理们一进酒楼门，一宗买卖一拍即合，供销员一坐上席，生意信息能通四海，经商人的酒杯一碰，财源滚滚可达三江。心畅脸红，“之乎者也”言之，悠哉乐哉如入仙乡。
    “民以食为天，官也以吃为先”。酒楼茶馆的吃喝，不止于平民百姓乃至乞丐拾破烂的光顾，连上官下吏也在对着吃，不管上级三令五申地叫得震天响，酒楼的生意还是日趋兴盛经久不衰。什么山珍海味、贡品特产摆满酒台。高朋满席，奇言怪论无所不谈，就“风卷残云”，油嘴一抹，扬长而去，大小“圣旨”也禁不了那张贪吃的嘴巴，吃风处处劲吹矣！
    小城的街口有南北两家酒楼。70年代均是国营招待所。80年代初搞活经济追赶潮流盛行时髦，北楼便请了一个澳门的装修队，花了几十万元重新整葺得富丽堂皇，焕然一新。别说进去，就算看看门面的人也赞叹不止，“一间超现代水准的一流酒楼”。北楼的经理换了几届后搞了承包，承包的A经理鼻大眉浓，皮滑肉油，眼乌口大，一脸福相，一身西装革履。职工们叫他“钱”经理。钱经理生意经营有“方”，唯利是图，灵活得无边无际，不管是烟还是酒，顾客买什么东西都可转开餐厅发票，数额还可加大。酒楼既有钱赚，办事人又有油水可捞，两头有利。尽在发票上做手脚，宴席税也能逃避，按A经理说，“上有政策，下有对策，你有法律，我有权术”。真是日无虚座，宾客盈门。
    职工的收入当然可观，发奖金发到心甜，领实物领到发笑。经理的收入更多，肚饱眼腻大家都趾高气扬，十分得意，引得外人既嫉妒又羡慕。
    再说南楼，50多岁的B经理已任职20多年，一张笑脸，一套正规老调，相貌平平，穿着朴素，无起无发，酒楼不舍得装修，只是粉刷墙身，稍为收拾一下，保留着不豪华也不土气的面目。
    他掌管南楼的生意，死守正统。北楼超标的采取多开几张发票逃避税收，“工作餐”四菜一汤是用加大的菜盘应付。他老是不开窍，吃什么就开什么发票，接待的标准都按“红头”文件，“工作餐”是不加码的四菜一汤，超标的酒宴也不分席，不多开发票照章纳税，靠的是价廉物美味鲜，讲究信誉讲求实惠和热情周到招徕顾客，当然是靠做些熟客“清水”单位和一般市民的生意，收入勉强过得去。有时，北楼的高收入自然会传到南楼B经理耳中，职工们老提意见，说他不灵活“铁板一块”。但他还是“独断专行”，他有他的老一套。“腐败类的邪门歪道哪算灵活？”
    谁也没想到，不久上头果然发了文件，清除腐败现象，反对“官倒”，开始了整顿。好景不长，北楼真的停业整顿。纪委监察局的人来过，税务局工商局的人来过，连公安、检察、法院的人也不断来问话。查得人心惶惶，翻得帐本柔柔皱皱，审得A经理垂头丧气，累得财会人员满头大汗，弄得职工“唔清唔楚”。
    “瞒税的要补税！”“扩大发票的要罚款！”“私分的几十万不合理奖金要清退！”上头的处理决定一项接一项，职工们大伤元气，顾客也一天比一天少，个个恨爹怨娘责天怪地。人们都说，违法乱纪为所欲为的始终不能过关。
    南楼的经理却稳坐“钓鱼船”，生意一直稳稳当当。清除腐败现象不断深入开展，邪门歪道有所收敛，党风和社会风气也有好转，南楼的顾客不但越来越多，而且名誉也越来越高。B经理说，我早就知道这种风气不能蔓延和持续下去的。职工们说，还是我们经理的主意好，把关严和业务端正。
    这次处理北楼，人们都拍手称快，议论纷纷。“看来这次反对腐败现象从中央到地方下死决心了”，“不靠正道上去的也会跌下来”……
    我感到有些内疚，近年来多做接待工作，陪吃也不少，常在北楼接待上级和被下级接待。这次当我走进南楼时，看到兴致勃勃的B经理和热情周到的服务小姐，心里就添了几分的敬意。当四菜一汤的标准“工作餐”端上来时，我似乎感到，过去那种上下级关系、人与人之间的和睦关系一幕幕地展现在眼前。我好像得到了些什么，啊，不是么？已遗失多年的与人民同甘共苦的优良作风和上下步调相一致的光荣传统，在南楼不是拾回来了吗……
