	New York Times, August 19 - According to a report by Kyodo News on the 19th, a chicken farm in Mizuho Town, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, suffered a power outage due to a lightning strike, leading to a lack of oxygen in the chicken coop and the death of approximately 20,000 chickens.

	At around 4:30 PM on the 17th, farm workers heard a loud thunderclap nearby and immediately went to inspect the chicken coop but found nothing unusual. However, when they returned to check at around 7:00 PM, they discovered that one of the coops had been struck by lightning, causing a short circuit in the integrated circuit of the power distribution panel. As a result, 12 ventilation fans stopped working, leading to a lack of oxygen inside the coop. Approximately 20,000 chickens died almost instantly.

    新华社东京8月19日电　据日本共同社19日报道，日本福冈县三潴町一养鸡场因遭雷击断电，造成鸡舍缺氧，致使2.5万只鸡丧生。
    17日下午4时半许，鸡场工作人员听到附近响了一声炸雷，随即到鸡舍巡视，没有发现异常。但7时左右再去察看时，发现方才没巡视到的1栋鸡舍因雷击中配电盘造成集成电路短路，12台换气扇停转，室内缺氧，约2.5万只鸡几乎全部死亡。
