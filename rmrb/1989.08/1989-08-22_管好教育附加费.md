	Managing the Education Surcharge

Currently, the education surcharge collected from farmers in rural areas is poorly managed, and there are serious instances of misappropriation. According to an investigation, a certain town in our county collected over 110,000 yuan in education surcharges last year, but only received over 80,000 yuan, with only over 40,000 yuan actually used for education. The rest was misappropriated for other purposes, resulting in the inability to pay the salaries of over 90 contract teachers on time. This year, seven contract teachers have left, affecting the teaching quality in rural schools. The public has strongly reacted to this issue. It is suggested that relevant departments take timely measures. First, conduct a comprehensive audit of the collection and use of rural education surcharges, and severely punish units or individuals that misappropriate education surcharges. Second, the collected education surcharges should be deposited in a special account in a bank to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose. Third, establish a set of specific management procedures for the collection and use of education surcharges to ensure that they are promptly and fully used for the development of rural education.

    管好教育附加费
    目前，农村从农民手中收取的教育附加费，管理混乱，被挪用的现象较为严重。据调查，我县某镇去年应收教育附加费11万元，实收8万多元，真正用于教育仅4万多元，其余均被挪作它用，使这个镇90多名民办教师工资不能按时发放。今年先后有7名民办教师“改嫁”，影响了农村学校的教学质量，群众对此反映强烈。建议有关部门及时采取措施，一是对农村教育附加费的征收使用情况来一次全面清理审计，对挪用教育附加费的单位或个人要给以严肃处理；二是收起来的教育附加费要在银行开设专户存储，确保专款专用；三是对教育附加费的征收使用要制定一套具体管理办法，使教育附加费能及时如数地用于发展农村教育事业。
