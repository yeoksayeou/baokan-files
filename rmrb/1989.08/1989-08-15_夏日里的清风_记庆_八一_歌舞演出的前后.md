Like a cool breeze in the summer, the four performances organized by the General Political Department to celebrate the "August 1" Army Day brought a refreshing joy to the military and civilians of the capital who had been suffering from the heatwave. People sincerely exclaimed, "It has been a long time since we have seen such an inspiring performance!"

Why did a single evening show touch so many viewers' emotions?

The author arrived at the Air Force Gymnasium just in time for the final performance. Performers from the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe, General Political Department Opera Troupe, Comrade Art Troupe, Navy Political Department Art Troupe, and Air Force Political Department Song and Dance Troupe were all neatly preparing for their stage appearances. Among them were well-known veterans of the music scene like Li Shuangjiang, Ma Guanguang, and Kelimu, as well as young singers and dancers who had been active on stage in recent years, such as Peng Liyuan, Dong Wenhua, Yu Junjian, Yan Weiwen, Wang Xiufen, Hua Chao, Liu Jun, and Li Qingming. In recent years, the military's artistic creation and performance industry has developed rapidly, producing a batch of talents and excellent programs. For example, in several national art competitions or evaluations held in recent years, such as the "New Era Ten Years of Golden Songs and 1988 Golden Star Selection," the "Second National Dance Competition," and "Listeners' Favorite Singers," military performers and works often won a large proportion of the awards. This celebration of "August 1" with song and dance can be said to be a showcase of the high-level creation and performance of military arts workers.

"Organizing such a performance is the wish of the broad masses of our military personnel," said Zhu Li, the main designer of the performance and deputy director of the General Political Department's Cultural Department, in the rest room. After the celebration of the "July 1" arts performance, to commemorate the 62-year glorious journey of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Central Military Commission and some senior generals of the three general departments unanimously agreed that it was very necessary to hold a performance to vividly, diversely, and fully present the artistic image of "The People's Army Loves the People." The main leaders of the General Political Department listened to the progress reports of the preparations several times and repeatedly instructed the relevant departments: Through the form of song and dance, evoke people's memories of the glorious traditions, purposes, and brilliant achievements of our army, and deepen the feelings between the people and the army.

On the stage backdrop of this performance, seven dazzling large characters were hung: "The People's Army Loves the People." Zhu Li explained that this is the main theme of this performance, and the determination of this theme is also the opinion of the military commission leaders. The fundamental factor in the growth of the People's Liberation Army from small to large and from weak to strong is the support of the people. Without the strong backing of the broad masses of the people, the development of the People's Army would be unthinkable.

The performance was so inspiring, with a grand and magnificent stage, and a powerful and vigorous atmosphere. Over 1,000 arts workers and over 2,000 soldiers from the army, navy, and air force stationed in Beijing, as well as the martial law troops, sang and danced together, sometimes in chorus, sometimes solo, accompanied by group dances and solo dances, interwoven with the symphony of a large orchestra, creating a continuous series of pictures and peaks. The 40-plus songs selected for the performance are all artistic treasures that emerged in various historical periods since the founding of the army. These songs have been sung for decades and are still popular and enduring, such as "Four Crossings of the Red Water, Strange Tactics," "South Ditch," "Song of the Guerrillas," "Mountain Flowers Bloom Red," "Praise of the Red Plum Blossom," and "Song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," all of which have strong vitality. The dance art director for this performance is the famous dancer Liu Ying. In recent years, the dances he has choreographed, such as "Seagull" and "Soldiers' March," have won numerous awards in the country. His dance style is vigorous and powerful, bold and unrestrained, with an inherent masculine beauty. Many of the dances in this performance have inherited his performance style, rough but not lacking in delicacy, powerful yet internally elegant, with a distinctive military character, adding much to the overall performance.

This high-quality song and dance performance, from rehearsal to the official performance, took only about 20 days, showcasing the relatively high ideological and artistic quality of military arts workers. People noticed during the viewing that this performance had a distinct feature: a proper stage presence. All the performers were spirited and vibrant, and the stage design was elegant and dignified. The soldiers from the army, navy, and air force participating in the grand chorus formed several color blocks, appearing neatly and uniformly, powerfully and majestically before the audience. The performance proceeded from beginning to end in a solemn, celebratory, and exciting atmosphere. This contrasts sharply with the stage trends of recent years. Many performers believe that they are military arts workers, and every artistic move represents the image of the military and the army. A performer standing on stage not only has to be responsible to themselves but also to the audience. Artists should advocate for a sense of social responsibility.

On July 29, the party, government, and military leaders who attended the performance all praised the performance. Some leaders, when they saw the chorus "South Ditch," couldn't help but hum along softly in their seats. Some said, "Hearing your songs, I am taken back to those days." These songs and dances are not only loved by the older generation but also by the younger generation. A young man under 20 years old managed to watch six rehearsals and performances, excitedly saying, "I have never heard so many powerful songs."

    夏日里的清风
    ——记庆“八一”歌舞演出的前后
    陈大鹏
    像夏日里一股清新的凉风吹拂心头，由总政治部主办的四场庆祝“八一”建军节歌舞演出，给受热浪袭扰的首都军民带来阵阵快意。人们由衷地赞叹：“许久没有看到这样令人振奋的演出了！”
    为什么一台晚会牵动了那么多观众的情愫？
    笔者来到了空军体育馆，正赶上最后一场演出。来自总政歌舞团、总政歌剧团、战友文工团、海政文工团、空政歌舞团等文艺团体的演员们正井井有条地做着上场的准备工作。他们中间有很早以前就为人们所熟悉的音坛老将李双江、马国光、克里木，也有近几年活跃在舞台上的青年歌手、青年舞蹈家彭丽媛、董文华、郁钧剑、阎维文、王秀芬、华超、刘军、李清明等。近几年，军队的文艺创作、表演事业发展很快，出现了一批人才和优秀节目。以近几年举办的几次全国性艺术比赛或评比为例，如“新时期十年金曲和1988年金星评选”、“第二届全国舞蹈比赛”、“听众最喜爱的歌手”等，军队的演员和作品的获奖往往占很大的比例。这次庆祝“八一”的歌舞演出，可说是军队文艺工作者高水平的创作和表演的展示。
    “举办这么一场演出，是我军广大指战员的心愿。”演出的主要设计者、总政文化部副部长朱力在休息室里对我介绍说，继庆“七一”的文艺演出后，为了纪念中国人民解放军走过的62年光辉历程，中央军委和三总部的一些高级将领们一致认为非常有必要举办一场演出，以生动、多采、丰满的艺术形象来表现“人民军队爱人民”这一宗旨。总政的主要领导同志一次又一次地听取筹备情况的汇报，一再指示有关部门：要通过歌舞的形式，唤起人们对我军光荣传统、我军宗旨、我军光辉业绩的回忆，加深人民和军队之间的感情。
    在这次演出的舞台背景上，悬挂着七个耀眼的大字：“人民军队爱人民”。朱力解释道，这是这次演出的主旋律，确定这个主题也是军委领导的意见。人民解放军从小到大、从弱到强的一个根本因素就是靠人民的支持，没有广大人民作坚强的后盾，人民军队的发展也就无从谈起。
    演出是那样的振奋人心，场面恢宏壮观，气势雄伟刚劲。1000多名文艺工作者、2000多名驻京陆海空三军和戒严部队指战员且歌且舞，时而合唱，时而独唱，并伴以群舞和独舞，其中交织着大型乐队的合奏，令场上画面迭出，高潮频起。演出中选用的40多首歌曲，都是建军以来各个历史时期涌现出的艺术珍品。这些歌曲唱了几十年，仍然脍炙人口，经久不衰，如《四渡赤水出奇兵》、《南泥湾》、《游击队之歌》、《山丹丹开花红艳艳》、《红梅赞》、《中国人民志愿军战歌》等，都具有很强的生命力。担任这次演出的舞蹈艺术的指导是国内著名的舞蹈家刘英。这几年，由他编排的舞蹈《海燕》、《士兵进行曲》等多次在国内获大奖。他的舞蹈风格遒劲有力、豪迈奔放，具有内在的阳刚之美。这次演出的舞蹈有不少承袭了他的表演风格，粗犷而不失细腻，刚劲又内藏秀雅，具有鲜明的军队特色，所创造的氛围为整台演出增色不少。
    这台高质量的歌舞表演，从排练到正式演出只花了20多天的时间，显示了军队文艺工作者较高的思想和艺术素质。人们在观看中注意到，这台演出有一个鲜明的特点就是：台风正。参加演出的所有演员一个个英姿飒爽，精神振奋，舞美设计也典雅庄重。演出场地上参加大合唱的陆海空三军指战员形成几个色块，整齐划一、威武雄壮地展现在观众面前，演出自始至终在一种庄严、欢庆、激奋的气氛中进行。这和近几年有些舞台的风气形成了鲜明的对照。不少演员认为，他们是军队的文艺工作者，艺术上的一举一动都代表了军人的形象、军队的形象，一个演员站在舞台上不仅要对自己负责，还要对观众负责。应该倡导艺术家的社会责任感。
    7月29日，出席观看演出的党政军领导对表演无不叫好。有的领导在看到合唱《南泥湾》时，情不自禁地在座位上小声哼唱起来。有的说：“听了你们的歌声，我又回到了那个年代。”这些歌舞不仅老一辈人爱看，就是年轻一代也爱看。一位不满20岁的青年人想方设法观看了六场排练和演出，兴奋地说：“从来没有听过这么多有气势的歌。”
