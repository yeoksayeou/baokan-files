Mongolia Establishes Diplomatic Relations with the European Community

	Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 6 - According to today's report in Mongolia's *Truth Newspaper*, Mongolia and the European Community established diplomatic relations on July 31 of this year.

	The report states that Mongolia hopes to sign a cooperation agreement with the European Community and develop economic and trade relations.

	In recent years, Mongolia has changed its foreign policy from one based on ideological lines to one that emphasizes economic interests. While maintaining traditional friendly relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Mongolia has actively developed relations with Asian countries and Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and Japan. Currently, Mongolia has established trade relations with over 200 companies from 20 Western countries and is preparing to establish joint ventures with these countries.
