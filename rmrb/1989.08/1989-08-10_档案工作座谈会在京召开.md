The State Archives Bureau recently held a symposium on archives work in Beijing to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting proposed to adhere to the principles of party nature and political nature in archives work, to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, and to adhere to the direction of serving socialism.

At the beginning of the meeting, Feng Zizhi, Director of the State Archives Bureau, delivered a speech.

The meeting believed that China's archives work, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, is a socialist archives cause that implements unified management of party and government archives. It is a highly party-natured work and a highly political work. Only by adhering to the party principle and the direction of serving socialism can China's archives cause develop continuously on the correct track.

The meeting emphasized that in the study of archival science, the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought should be adhered to, the principle of combining theory with practice should be implemented, and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy should be continued. The correct guidance of archival science research should be adhered to. Archival science research should be innovative and developed, but innovation should not deny the four cardinal principles and should not deny the theories that have been proven correct by practice.

    据新华社北京八月十日电国家档案局日前在北京召开档案工作座谈会，贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神。会议提出，坚持档案工作的党性和政治性原则，坚持改革开放的方针，坚持为社会主义服务的方向。
    国家档案局局长冯子直在会议开始时讲了话。
    会议认为，我国档案工作是在中国共产党领导下，实行党、政档案统一管理的社会主义档案事业。它是一项党性很强的工作，是一项政治性很强的工作。只有坚持党性原则，坚持为社会主义服务的方向，才能使我国的档案事业在正确的轨道上得到不断地发展。
    会议强调，在档案学研究中要坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想的指导，贯彻理论联系实际的原则，继续执行“双百方针”，要坚持对档案学研究的正确引导。档案学研究要创新，要发展，但创新不能否定四项基本原则，不能否定已被实践证明是正确的理论。
