Central Military Commission Deputy Secretary Hong Xuezhi published an article titled "Perseverance and Progress" in the 8th issue of "China's Elderly."

The article states that this year's Army Day holds special and extraordinary significance. It comes at a crucial moment when the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital has achieved decisive victory, and the world's attention is focused on the successful conclusion of the Party's 13th Fourth Plenum. As a soldier who has participated in the revolution for 60 years, along with countless old comrades, I feel deeply gratified. Let us together celebrate the great victories of the Party and the country, and with full confidence, continue to advance along the direction indicated by the Fourth Plenum!

The article says that whether in the military or among retired comrades in the localities, you, as the older generation of revolutionaries, have, in the years of war, fought bravely for the liberation of the nation and the happiness of the people, making significant contributions. Your deeds are forever recorded in the annals of the People's Republic, and your achievements are forever inscribed in the history of the people's army. In the period of peaceful construction, you have remembered the noble mission of serving the people as communists, and have not forgotten the fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance of our Party and army. You have devoted your heart and soul to the cause of socialist construction, achieving remarkable results. In the new historical period of reform and opening up, old comrades not only remain spirited and enthusiastic, always firmly in line with the Party Central Committee, upholding the four cardinal principles, and making new contributions to economic construction, but also persist in educating the younger generation in patriotism and the revolutionary tradition of hard work. Especially in this special battle to oppose turmoil and suppress the rebellion, old comrades have shown a high degree of awareness and sense of responsibility in loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving the socialist cause. In the struggle against the enemy, they have demonstrated the heroic spirit and iron will of old communists. The Party thanks you, and the people thank you.

The article says that old comrades have shown a lofty revolutionary spirit, facing dangers without fear, and not seeking personal glory. When they grow old, for the sake of the revolutionary cause having successors, generation after generation, they put the overall situation first and happily retired, embarking on a new journey in life. You have not rested on your laurels because of your high achievements and reputation, but continue to contribute your remaining strength and strive unceasingly. Some have taken on the voluntary task of educating the next generation; some have returned to the places where they once fought the revolution, offering advice for the construction of the old revolutionary base areas; some have conducted in-depth investigations and research, providing consultation for decision-making bodies; and some have written books, summarizing their decades of military life, leaving valuable spiritual wealth for future generations, fully embodying the unyielding spirit of old comrades and their noble sentiments of serving the people. At the same time, they have also provided fresh experiences for the construction of the Party and the army in the new era through their personal practice.

The article expresses confidence that with the far-sighted leadership of comrades like Deng Xiaoping and other veteran revolutionaries who have been tested by the Party, and with the guidance and personal example of old comrades, and with the unity of the old and new generations, working together, our socialist modernization construction will definitely develop healthily. Our tradition of perseverance, self-reliance, and frugal construction will definitely be passed down from generation to generation. Our cause is great, and our future is bright.

    艰苦奋斗　继往开来
    新华社北京7月31日电　中央军委副秘书长洪学智在《中国老年》第8期发表题为《艰苦奋斗继往开来》的文章。
    文章说，今年的建军节具有特殊的不平凡的意义。它是在平息首都反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利，举世瞩目的党的十三届四中全会圆满成功的关键时刻来到的。我作为参加革命60周年的1名军人与千千万万老同志的心情一样，感到十分欣慰，让我们共同祝贺党和国家取得的伟大胜利，满怀信心地沿着四中全会指引的方向继续前进！
    文章说，无论是军队，还是地方的离退休老同志们，你们作为老一代的革命者，在战争年代，为了民族的解放，人民的幸福，南征北战，英勇奋斗，立下了汗马功劳，在人民共和国的功勋册里，永记着你们的功勋；在人民军队的战史上，永存着你们的业绩。在和平建设时期，你们牢记共产党人为人民服务的崇高宗旨，不忘我党我军艰苦奋斗的优良传统，为社会主义建设事业呕心沥血，政绩卓著。在改革开放的新的历史时期，老同志们不仅精神焕发、斗志昂扬，始终坚决与党中央保持一致，坚持四项基本原则，为经济建设作出新的贡献，还坚持对青年一代进行爱国主义和艰苦奋斗的革命传统教育。特别是在这次反对动乱、平息暴乱的特殊战斗里，老同志们又体现出热爱祖国，热爱人民，热爱社会主义事业的高度自觉性和责任感，在同敌人的斗争中表现出了老共产党人的英雄本色和铮铮铁骨。党感谢你们，人民感谢你们。
    文章说，老同志们一生艰险不辞，功成不居，具有崇高的革命品质。当自己年龄大了时，为了革命事业后继有人，一代一代传下去，又以大局为重，愉快地退下来，走向新的人生旅程。你们没有因功高望重而颐养天年，而是继续发挥余热、奋斗不息。有的义务承担起教育下一代的任务；有的回到当年闹革命的地方，为老区建设献计献策；有的深入实际调查研究，为决策机关提供咨询意见；还有的著书立说，总结几十年的戎马生涯，为后人留下宝贵的精神财富，充分体现了老同志们永不衰竭的进取之心和为人民谋利益的高尚情操。同时，也用你们的亲身实践为新时期党的建设、军队建设提供了新鲜经验。
    文章表示相信，有邓小平同志等党内久经考验的老一辈革命家的深谋远虑，鼎力支持，有老同志们的言传身教，身体力行，有新老团结，携手并进，我们的社会主义现代化建设事业一定会健康地发展。我们的艰苦奋斗，自力更生，勤俭建国的光荣传统一定会一代一代传下去，我们的事业是伟大的，前途是光明的。
