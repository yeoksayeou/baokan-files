China's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shuqing spoke yesterday afternoon at the second ministerial-level meeting of the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue, reiterating China's stance. Liu Shuqing said, "In the past month, our conference has done a lot of work and made strenuous efforts. We cannot say there have been no results, but on some important issues, no agreement has been reached, so the progress of the conference is disappointing."

Liu Shuqing emphasized that the Cambodian issue was created by the country that invaded Cambodia, and solving the Cambodian issue today depends on the sincerity of that country. If there is genuine sincerity, the few difficulties encountered in this international conference are not hard to resolve.

Vice Minister Liu Shuqing believes that the core of these difficulties is how to supervise Vietnam's complete withdrawal from Cambodia and the establishment of a four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk during the transitional period. If these two most difficult problems are solved, it is believed that other problems will be relatively easier to solve.

He pointed out that any solution for the arrangement of the interim government of Cambodia during the transitional period must reflect the principles of four-party unity and leadership by Prince Sihanouk. Only in this way can the spirit of national reconciliation be embodied, and the peace within Cambodia ensured, creating good conditions for holding free and fair elections in the future. Those who come to Paris with the sincere wish to truly restore peace in Cambodia and to comprehensively solve the Cambodian issue need to seriously consider this issue.

Vice Minister Liu Shuqing finally said, "Our conference has reached a crucial stage. The whole world is watching us, expecting the conference to achieve positive results, to soon eliminate this regional hotspot that has dragged on for more than a decade, to end the disasters and misfortunes of the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples, and to contribute to the peace and stability of Asia and the world. The Chinese delegation has been working tirelessly for the success of the international conference since arriving in Paris. We will continue to work with all parties attending the conference to contribute to the success of this ministerial-level meeting."

    刘述卿在巴黎国际会议上指出
    解决柬问题要看越南诚意
    本报巴黎8月29日电　中国副外长刘述卿昨天下午在柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议第二次部长级会议上发言，再次阐述中国立场。刘述卿说，一个月来，我们的会议进行了大量的工作，作出了艰苦的努力，不能说没有成果，但在一些重要问题上未能达成任何协议，因而会议的进展是令人失望的。
    刘述卿强调指出，柬埔寨问题是由出兵入侵柬埔寨的那个国家造成的，今天解决柬埔寨问题就要看那个国家的诚意。如果真有诚意，我们这次国际会议碰到的几个难题是不难解决的。
    刘述卿副外长认为，几个难题中的核心问题是如何监督越南从柬埔寨真正全部撤军，以及在过渡时期成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府的问题。如果这两个最困难的问题解决了，相信其他问题也就比较容易解决了。
    他指出，任何解决方案对过渡时期柬埔寨临时政府的安排，必须反映四方联合和以西哈努克亲王为首的原则。只有这样，才能体现民族和解精神和确保柬埔寨国内和平，并为未来举行自由公正的大选创造良好的条件。凡是希望柬埔寨真正恢复和平和怀有全面解决柬埔寨问题的真诚愿望而来巴黎的人，都需要严肃认真地考虑这个问题。
    刘述卿副外长最后说，我们的会议已到了最后关键的阶段。全世界人民都在注视着我们，期待着会议取得积极成果，以早日消除这个拖了十多年的地区热点，结束柬埔寨人民和越南人民的灾难和不幸，为亚洲乃至世界和平与稳定作出贡献。中国代表团从踏上巴黎的时刻时起，一直在为国际会议的成功进行着不倦的努力。我们将继续同与会各方一道，为这次部长级会议的成功作出自己的贡献。
