The Beijing delegation, which ranked 20th in the first National Youth Games four years ago, announced at a press conference today that their focus for the second Youth Games is on training and developing talent.

Since the first Youth Games, the Beijing Sports Delegation has keenly felt the shortage of reserve talent. In response, the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission made a strategic decision at the 1986 Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau meeting to establish a four-tier training system. This system includes the city's top sports teams, sports schools, district and county sports branches, amateur sports schools, and key traditional sports schools and middle school representative teams. The goal is to meet the needs of Beijing's competitive sports development.

During the five-month preliminary competition for this Youth Games, the Beijing delegation showed early promise. In the 23 events they participated in, 251 athletes from 22 events qualified for the finals, placing the delegation fifth nationally.

    青运会北京代表团表示
    培养人才重在练兵
    本报北京8月3日讯　记者江正茂、李北大报道：四年前曾在第一届全国青少年运动会上名列第20名的北京代表团，在今天举行的新闻发布会上宣布，此次参加第二届青运会，重在练兵，培养人才。
    北京体育代表团自从第一届青运会后，才真切地感受到后备人才不足的严重性。为此，在1986年北京市体工会上，市体委作出部署，决定建立由市优秀运动队、市运动学校、市区县体育分校、市业余体校、包括重点传统体育项目学校及中小学代表队组成的四级训练体制，以适应北京竞技运动发展的需要。
    在这次历时5个多月的青运会预赛中，北京代表团初露锋芒，在所参加的23个项目的角逐中，有22项251人取得决赛权，位居全国第五。
