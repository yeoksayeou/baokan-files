	Ma Chunji, the director of the Jinan Automobile Parts Factory, created the "Interlocking Contracting Method," which has brought significant benefits to the factory since its implementation. In June of this year, this method won the Modern Management Achievement Award of Shandong Province.

	The "Interlocking Contracting Method" links the production, sales, finance, supply, and quality inspection departments, contracting the overall operational indicators of the entire factory. In addition to completing their own indicators, each department is also responsible for the indicators of other departments. If a department fails to meet its own indicators, it will have its bonus revoked, and other departments will also have a certain percentage of their bonuses deducted. This forms an interdependent chain among the departments, effectively overcoming the problem of inter-departmental friction and blame-shifting that affects the overall benefits of the factory.

	The "Interlocking Contracting Method" embodies the principle of "regardless of the reason, if there is no overall benefit, the individual unit will not receive or will receive less bonus." This has suppressed the past phenomenon of only focusing on work hours without considering quality, only focusing on production without considering sales, and has eliminated the unreasonable situation of "poor enterprise performance but generous individual bonuses." Several key operational departments have basically formed an organic whole, making the best use of limited manpower, financial resources, and materials. In the first seven months of this year, the factory's output value, sales revenue, and realized profits all reached historical highs, increasing by 25%, 25%, and 137% respectively compared to the same period last year. The growth rate ranks first in the national automobile parts industry.

### 马纯济创“连环承包法”  体现总体效益  有利协调作战

    马纯济创“连环承包法”
    体现总体效益  有利协调作战
    本报讯　济南汽车配件厂厂长马纯济创造的“连环承包法”，在本企业推行后获益匪浅。今年6月，此法获山东省管理现代化成果奖。
    “连环承包法”把生产、销售、财务、供运、质检5个主要生产经营科室拴在一起，承包全厂的经营指标。每个科室除完成自己的指标外，还对其他科室的指标负有一定责任。一个科室若完不成自身指标，则实行奖金否定，其他科室也扣除一定比例的奖金。这样，各科室之间形成了一个彼此协同作战的连环套，较好地克服了因扯皮推诿而影响全厂整体效益的弊端。
      “连环承包法”由于体现了“不管什么原因，只要没有总体效益，小单位也不得或少得”的原则，使过去那种只顾工时不管质量、只管产量不管销量的现象得到抑制，并消除了“企业效益不佳，单位奖金不少”的不合理现象，几个主要经营科室基本形成一个有机的整体，使有限的人财物力发挥出了最佳效应。今年头7个月，全厂的产值、销售收入、实现利润均创历史最高水平，比去年同期分别提高25％、25％和137％，其增长幅度列全国汽车配件行业之首。
