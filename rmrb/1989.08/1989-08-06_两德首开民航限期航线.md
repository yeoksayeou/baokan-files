The two Germanys will open limited airline routes for the first time. According to a report by the German News Agency on August 4, the national airline of the German Democratic Republic and Lufthansa of the Federal Republic of Germany will open routes from Leipzig to Dusseldorf and from Frankfurt to Leipzig on August 10 and 11, respectively. This is to expand air traffic to the Leipzig Trade Fair and provide more convenient transportation for tourists and businesspeople. The two routes will operate until the end of October this year.

According to sources, the airlines of the two countries will fly these two routes twice a week, forming fixed routes. However, the aircraft of both countries must pass through the airspace of a third country, Czechoslovakia, to reach the other side's airport. This is because a post-World War II treaty stipulates that only aircraft from the three major Western Allied powers—Britain, France, and the United States—can use the air corridors to travel between the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin. No other country's aircraft are allowed to fly over the border between the two Germanys. Additionally, to avoid any impact on the three Western countries' airlines, the German Democratic Republic is not allowed to establish passenger transfer services between Leipzig Airport and Berlin-Schönefeld Airport, nor can it arbitrarily change ticket prices.

Since 1973, when Lufthansa's aircraft first flew to Leipzig, air traffic between the two Germanys has only been limited to the Leipzig Trade Fair period.

    两德首开民航限期航线
    新华社柏林8月4日电  据德通社4日报道，本月10日和11日，民主德国国际航空公司和联邦德国汉莎航空公司将首次分别开辟莱比锡至杜塞尔多夫和法兰克福至莱比锡的航线，以扩大前往莱比锡博览会的空中交通，为游客和商人提供更方便的交通条件。两条航线将开至今年10月底。
    另据此间人士透露，两国民航飞机每周将分别在这两条航线上往返两次，并将形成固定航线，但两国飞机都必须经第3国捷克斯洛伐克领空才能飞往对方机场，因为第二次世界大战后有条约规定，除西方英法美3大战胜国的飞机可利用空中走廊往返于联邦德国与西柏林之间外，其他任何国家的飞机都无权飞越两德边界。此外，为了不对西方3国航空公司造成任何影响，民主德国方面不得在莱比锡机场与柏林—舍内菲尔德机场之间设立旅客接送业务，也不得随意改变机票价格。
    自1973年汉莎航空公司的飞机首次飞往莱比锡至今，两个德国间的空中交通还只限于莱比锡博览会期间。
