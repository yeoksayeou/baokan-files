General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to Shanghai. In just four or five days, he visited the grassroots, extensively interacting with workers, peasants, military personnel, intellectuals, and cadres from all walks of life, engaging in warm conversations. Everyone felt particularly close to him.

“Let’s shake hands with the General Secretary!”

At the front of the No. 2 Converter Shop of Shanghai No. 1 Steelworks, workers enthusiastically surrounded Jiang Zemin, who was wearing a safety helmet, eager to say, “Let’s shake hands with the General Secretary.” Jiang Zemin warmly shook hands with the steelworkers, exchanging greetings. At this moment, the General Secretary suggested, “Let’s sing a song together, how about ‘We Workers Have Strength’?”

“Good!”

“We workers have strength, hey, we workers have strength! Every day and every day we work hard, hey, every day and every day we work hard…” Under Jiang Zemin’s direction, a resounding chorus echoed. As they sang, Jiang Zemin noticed that some workers were not very familiar with the lyrics, so he said, “We should sing such songs often!” Witnessing this scene, one comrade said: I haven’t seen such a scene in many years!

During his visit to the No. 4 Workshop of Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, the General Secretary inquired about a young operator, Li Yongzhi, who had only been in the factory for three months, and then extended his hand. Little Li hurriedly took out a lint cloth to wipe his hands. “It’s okay!” Jiang Zemin said. Before Little Li could wipe his hands clean, his hand was already firmly grasped by the General Secretary.

At the intellectuals’ symposium, Jiang Zemin greeted Xie Jin, Wang Yinglai, Zhang Junxiang, Zhang Ruifang, Yuan Xuefen, Cao Peng, and others one by one, saying: We are old friends, let’s chat today. During the symposium, Xie Jin mentioned the four famous Kunqu Opera performers from the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe who refused monetary temptations and resolutely returned to the motherland. Jiang Zemin suggested, “Why don’t we ask them to stand up so everyone can recognize them!” Thus, in the midst of enthusiastic applause, Liang Guying, Yue Meiti, Liu Yilong, and Wang Quanzhen all stood up.

At the party, government, and military cadres’ meeting, Jiang Zemin walked around the round tables, shaking hands with each comrade. He emotionally told everyone, “I feel a bit reluctant to leave Shanghai.”

This time, the General Secretary returned to Shanghai, as he put it, “There is a sense of farewell, but also a sense of handover.”

The General Secretary talked with Shanghai comrades about how, in late July of this year, he visited Hubei and passed by the Yellow Crane Tower. “At that time, seeing the Yellow Crane Tower, I thought of Shanghai. I thought, I don’t want to be like the yellow crane that never returns!” He also mentioned his “connection” with Shanghai: before liberation, he studied at Jiaotong University in Shanghai; after liberation, he stayed until 1954 before leaving; during the three years of natural disasters, he returned to work in Shanghai, and after four years, he left again; after the Gang of Four was smashed, he came to Shanghai as a member of the central work team sent to Shanghai, and then left again; in 1985, he came to work in Shanghai for four years. He left countless footprints in Shanghai, and Shanghai left a deep impression in his heart.

This time, the General Secretary returned to Shanghai, not just for farewell and handover, but also to directly understand the actual situation and listen to the voices of the people.

At the workers’ symposium, after Zheng Jinxiu, the group leader of the No. 1 Weaving Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, finished reading her prepared speech, Jiang Zemin affectionately said to her, “I have a request, which is that I really want to know what problems and difficulties your factory still has, what the actual situation is like. You can say more after you finish your speech, okay?” At the intellectuals’ symposium, when he heard that due to time constraints, everyone’s speeches would be limited to “one hour,” he immediately said, “How about one and a half hours? I want to hear what everyone has to say first.” During his speech, Wang Huning, a deputy professor at Fudan University, mentioned that he was recently writing a theoretical article on “anti-corruption,” and Jiang Zemin immediately said, “Can you photocopy a copy of this article for me to read!” At the symposium in Tangwan Township, Shanghai County, when the township party secretary and the director of the municipal agricultural commission, Zhang Yan, talked about the investment of Shanghai’s suburban counties in agricultural infrastructure amounting to 200 million yuan annually, and the county party secretary, Sheng Yafei, talked about the county’s plans to carry out work to enhance the relationship between the people and the party and government, Jiang Zemin immediately took notes. He listened very carefully to the situation of the collective economy in rural areas, foreign trade production, family planning, and other matters, and frequently took notes. In his notebook, he recorded Shanghai’s suburban counties’ plans to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum: to strengthen party discipline, carry out socialist, patriotic, and arduous struggle education, and enhance education on the concept of national planning; he recorded the Shanghai people’s enthusiastic expectations for the Party Central Committee and the State Council’s decision to carry out seven major tasks in the near future: “The seven major tasks make the people happy and concerned,” “The seven major tasks are decided well”; he also recorded the various difficulties encountered in Shanghai’s key construction projects, as well as suggestions on how to carry out ideological and political work. On the morning of the 5th, he also watched with interest the newly modified Shanghai Santana sedan, expressing satisfaction with the smooth progress of localization.

During his stay in Shanghai, the General Secretary rode a medium-sized van with the municipal committee comrades every day, and wherever he went, it was just a cup of plain tea, with no one offering any drinks. Jiang Zemin insisted on eating at home.

Jiang Zemin, who had long worked and lived in Shanghai, expressed his hopes for the people and work of Shanghai this time.

Jiang Zemin hoped that through extensive and in-depth learning and solid ideological and political work, the spirit of the Fourth Plenum would be deeply rooted in Shanghai. At various symposiums, he spoke in a conversational tone and shared his experiences, helping everyone to have a deeper understanding of the spirit of the Fourth Plenum.

At the workers’ symposium, more than 100 workers, engineering and technical personnel, factory directors, and secretaries heard the General Secretary’s expectations for the working class: to overcome difficulties, tighten belts for a few years, and the working-class older brothers should take the lead! No matter what, Shanghai’s various industries must boost the economy! The General Secretary also required Shanghai to further enhance the vitality of large and medium-sized enterprises through deepening reforms. He said that large and medium-sized enterprises play a leading role in the national economy. Once large and medium-sized enterprises are revitalized, their backbone role in economic construction can be fully played, and there is hope for economic development.

In the countryside, Jiang Zemin repeatedly emphasized to rural cadres that food is the primary need of the people, and agriculture should be the foundation. In front of a high-yield test field in Wujing Village, Tangwan Township, Shanghai County, he mentioned a figure to the cadres: Our country has only over one mu of arable land per capita, while the United States has 15 mu, and Canada has 30 mu. Every inch of cultivable land should be fully utilized, and efforts should be made to increase the yield per unit area.

Jiang Zemin once said during his time as the Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary, “Difficulties and hopes coexist, opportunities and challenges appear together.” Now, the people of Shanghai still face such a situation. The people of Shanghai will remember the General Secretary’s sincere expectations for Shanghai this time: Shanghai is the largest industrial city and economic center in the country, and an important international port. It should and has the conditions to make new achievements in expanding reform and opening up. Shanghai has great potential, with many things to do, and it is full of hope and opportunities.

Yes, the people of Shanghai will bravely face the challenges, tenaciously overcome difficulties, and stride forward in reform and opening up, modernization construction, striving to make greater contributions to the country!

    总书记在上海人民中间
    江泽民同志到上海来了。短短四五天，总书记深入基层，同工人、农民、解放军指战员、知识分子和干部等各界人士广泛接触，热情交谈，大家都感到格外亲切。
      “阿拉跟总书记握握手！”
    在上钢一厂二转炉车间前，工人们一下子热情地围住了头戴安全帽的江泽民同志，争着说：“阿拉跟总书记握握手。”江泽民同志热情地握住钢铁工人们的手，相互问好。这时，总书记提议：“我们一起来唱个歌，唱《咱们工人有力量》好不好？”
      “好！”
    “咱们工人有力量，嗨，咱们工人有力量！每天每日工作忙，嗨，每天每日工作忙……”在江泽民同志的指挥下，响起了嘹亮的歌声。唱着唱着，江泽民同志发现有些工人不太熟悉后面的歌词，便说：“这样的歌我们还是经常要唱啊！”目睹此情此景，有位同志说：我已经好多年没有见到这样的场面了！
    在上海第二纺织机械厂四分厂参观时，总书记在一台数控车床前向进厂才三个月的青年操作工李永志询问后，向他伸出了手。小李赶忙拿起回丝擦手。“不要紧！”江泽民同志说。小李还没来得及擦干净，他的手已经被总书记紧紧地握住了。
    在知识分子座谈会上，江泽民同志主动向谢晋、王应睐、张骏祥、张瑞芳、袁雪芬、曹鹏等一一招呼，说：我们是老朋友了，今天一起谈谈心。座谈中，谢晋谈到了上海昆剧团四位著名演员拒绝金钱引诱，坚决回到祖国，江泽民同志建议：“是不是请他们站起来，让大家认识一下！”于是，在全场热烈的掌声中，梁谷音、岳美缇、刘异龙、王芝泉都站了起来。
    在党政军干部会议上，江泽民同志走到一张张圆桌旁，同每一位同志亲切握手。他动情地对大家说：“我离开上海，真有点依依不舍。”
    这次总书记回上海，用他自己的话来说：“有告别之意，也有交接之意。”
    总书记同上海同志谈起，今年7月下旬，他到湖北视察，车子经过黄鹤楼，“当时我见了黄鹤楼便想起了上海，我想，我可不要‘黄鹤一去不复返’啊！”说得大家都笑了起来。他还说起了他同上海的“缘份”：解放前在上海交大读书，解放后一直到1954年才离开；三年自然灾害时又回到上海工作，隔四年又离开了；粉碎“四人帮”以后，他作为中央派驻上海工作组的成员来到了上海，之后又离开；到1985年又来到上海工作了四年。他在上海留下了无数的脚印，上海在他心中留下了深深的感情。
      直接听听人民群众的心声
    这次总书记回上海，除了告别和交接，大家还看得出来，他十分想直接了解实际情况，听听人民群众的心声。
    在工人座谈会上，上棉一厂南织布机一班组长郑锦秀拿着事先写好的发言稿念完后，江泽民同志亲切地对她说：“我有一个要求，那就是我很想知道你们厂里究竟还有些什么问题，还存在些什么困难，实际情况究竟怎么样，你离开稿子后等一会儿还可以再说说，好吗？”在知识分子座谈会上，当他听说由于时间关系，大家的发言将要被规定在“一个小时之内”时，立刻说：“一个半小时吧，我要先听听大家说些什么。”复旦大学副教授王沪宁在发言中谈到，他最近正在写一篇关于“反腐败”的理论文章，江泽民同志立即说：“你这篇文章是否复印一份给我看看！”在上海县塘湾乡的座谈会上，由农村党委书记、市农委主任张燕谈到了上海郊县的乡镇工业对农业基本建设的投资每年为2亿，上海县县委书记盛亚飞谈到了县里准备开展增进群众同党和政府感情的工作，江泽民同志都立即用笔记了下来。对于这里农村集体经济的状况、外贸生产、计划生育等情况，他都听得十分仔细，并不时地作着记录。在他的笔记本上，还记下了上海郊县贯彻四中全会精神的打算：抓好党风建设，开展社会主义、爱国主义和艰苦奋斗的教育，增强国家计划观念的教育……；记下了所到之处上海人民对党中央和国务院决定近期做七件事的热烈期望：“七件大事人民高兴、人民关心”，“七件大事决定得好”；也记下了上海在建设重点工程中遇到的各种困难，以及如何开展思想政治工作的建议等。5日上午，他还饶有兴趣地观看了新改型的上海桑塔纳轿车，对国产化进展顺利表示满意。
    总书记在上海期间，每天同市委的同志乘坐一辆中型面包车，所到之处都是清茶一杯，也不见有人递过任何饮料。江泽民同志一直坚持在家里用餐。
    对上海人民、上海工作的厚望
    曾经在上海长期工作、生活过的江泽民同志，这次来到上海，对上海人民、上海的工作提出了厚望。
    江泽民同志希望在上海能够通过广泛深入的学习和扎扎实实的思想政治工作，使四中全会精神深入人心。在各种座谈会上，他针对各界人士的思想实际，用谈心的口吻、谈体会的方式，使大家对四中全会精神有更进一步的认识。
    在工人座谈会上，100多位工人、工程技术人员、厂长、书记们听到了总书记对工人阶级的期望：要克服困难，过几年紧日子，工人老大哥要带头！上海的各行各业无论如何要把经济搞上去！总书记还要求上海通过深化改革，进一步增强大中型企业的活力。他说，大中型企业在国民经济中占主导地位。大中型企业搞活了，它们在经济建设中的骨干作用可以得到发挥，经济搞上去就有希望。
    在农村，江泽民同志不止一次地对农村干部强调，民以食为天，要以农业为基础。在上海县塘湾乡吴泾村一块丰产试验田前，他对干部们提到了这样一个数字：我国人均的耕地只有一亩多，而美国是15亩，加拿大是30亩。要充分利用每一寸可耕的土地，努力提高单位面积的产量。
    记得去年江泽民同志在上海担任市委书记时，曾在一次会上仿照唐代诗人王勃《滕王阁序》中的名句“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”，说过这样一句形容当时上海形势的话：“困难和希望同时并存，机会和挑战一起出现”。现在，上海人民面临的仍然是这样的局面。上海人民将记住总书记这次对上海的衷心期望：上海是全国最大的工业城市和经济中心，也是一个重要的国际港口，完全应该也有条件在扩大改革开放方面做出新成绩。上海在这方面的潜力很大，有许多文章可做，是大有可为、大有希望的。
    是的，上海人民一定会勇敢地迎接挑战，顽强地克服困难，在改革开放、建设四化中大踏步前进，努力为全国作出更大的贡献！
