Winning the Wimbledon tennis championship is the dream of every tennis star. The American veteran John McEnroe, who has tasted victory three times, is no exception. However, in the recently concluded Wimbledon tournament, his luck was not on his side. After losing in the semifinals to Edberg, this famous "bad boy" of the tennis court told reporters with a touch of sadness: "The only consolation I have is thinking that I can quickly return home to see my wife and children."

McEnroe is undoubtedly one of the most talented athletes in tennis history. In the 1981, 1983, and 1984 Wimbledon tournaments, he almost effortlessly defeated all the "tennis giants," becoming the undisputed king of the world tennis scene. However, in January 1986, he unexpectedly lost to the relatively unknown compatriot Gilbert. It is said that after the match, he angrily muttered: "If you lose to someone like Gilbert, you should really think about it."

So he left the tennis court and went into seclusion to "reflect." Half a year later, he reappeared in the fifth US Open, attempting to regain his former glory, but suffered a crushing defeat. The famous Czech athlete Ivan Lendl sarcastically remarked: "If tennis has made a big leap forward in the past half year, McEnroe has almost forgotten all his skills." Soon after, due to a particularly poor performance that matched his "bad boy" reputation, McEnroe was suspended from competing for three months. That period was truly unlucky for him.

In the summer of 1986, McEnroe married the very beautiful but indifferent American actress Tatum O'Neal, and quickly became a father. Naturally, his lovely wife and child took up a lot of his energy. People still remember the scene at the beginning of this year when O'Neal, with a displeased expression, ran to her husband's press conference to tell him, "Kevin won't go to sleep." Many people were worried: Would marriage put an end to McEnroe's tennis career? Lendl put it more clearly: If McEnroe knew when to quit while he was ahead, he would be remembered as a genius in the annals of tennis; otherwise, he might not even be able to keep his current fame.

McEnroe, however, didn't care about fame or infamy. He wanted to play tennis; he couldn't imagine his life without it. Perhaps it is this stubbornness that people have come to like, along with a bit of sympathy for a declining king of the court. Despite McEnroe's continuous defeats, people have grown even more fond of this unlucky "bad boy." Every major tournament, no matter where it is held, as long as McEnroe appears, the cheers of the fans are directed at him.

However, McEnroe is not playing for the sympathy of the crowd. His goal is to reign supreme in the world of tennis once again and to win the Wimbledon men's singles title for the fourth time.

Achieving this goal is not easy. The "bad boy" is already nearing 30, his serves are no longer as formidable as before, and his running is always a step behind the ball. The improvement in the world tennis level is astonishing, and Lendl was right about that. To counter the relentless challenges of the new generation of athletes, McEnroe, with the help of his coach, formulated a rigorous physical training plan and carried it out diligently, like a good student. This was something he had never done before. Moreover, family life is not as disruptive to his training as people might think. To a large extent, it has influenced the "bad boy's" character, making him more patient and tolerant, like a father. In short, many people who know McEnroe say that in the past two years, he has almost become a different person—from a "bad boy" to a hardworking, down-to-earth good athlete.

The hard training finally paid off. At the beginning of this year, McEnroe won several major tournaments in a row. In the Dallas World Tennis Championships held in February, he defeated his old rival Lendl, who had often spoken ill of him, and took a long breath of relief after two years of frustration, and won the gold medal in this competition.

The goal of winning the Wimbledon gold medal seemed within reach, almost within arm's reach. All commentators also listed McEnroe as one of the most likely gold medal contenders in this tournament. People hoped that the competition would give a definitive answer. Unfortunately, in the moment of reaching for the gold, McEnroe was still a step behind Boris Becker of West Germany. What caused much discussion was whether this was the same step he always lagged behind in his running to return the ball?

    麦肯罗慢了一步
    胡锡进
    摘取温布尔登网球赛的金牌，是所有网球名星梦寐以求的目标。曾经三次尝过冠军滋味的美国老将麦肯罗也不例外。不过在不久前结束的今年温布尔登大赛上，他的时运欠佳，半决赛输给埃德伯格之后，这位有名的网球场上的“坏孩子”不无伤感地对记者说：他现在唯一的安慰就是“想到能很快回家见到爱妻和孩子”。
    麦肯罗可谓是网球史上最富天才的运动员。1981年、1983年和1984年的温布尔登网球赛上，他几乎只是“耍了点小聪明”，就使所有“网球大将”拜倒在他的拍下，成为世界网坛无可争辩的霸主。然而1986年1月他却意外地输给了不很有名的同胞吉尔贝尔特。据说赛后他忿忿地骂了一句：“如果你连吉尔贝尔特这号人都输的话，就该好好思考一番了。”
    于是他离开网球场，闭门“思考”去了。半年以后，他才在第五届美国网球公开赛上再次露面，试图重振雄风，结果遭到惨败。捷克著名运动员伦德尔十分刻薄地挖苦道：如果说网球运动在这半年里往前跨了一大步的话，麦肯罗可是把自己的本事忘得差不多了。不久，由于一次与他的“坏孩子”的名声十分相符的恶劣表现，麦肯罗受到被停止比赛资格三个月的惩罚。那段时间他真是倒霉透了。
    1986年夏天，麦肯罗与十分漂亮、但却对他的网坛前途不感兴趣的美国女演员奥妮尔结为伉俪，并且很快做了父亲。娇妻爱子自然要分去他不少精力。人们都还记得今年年初奥妮尔面带愠色跑到丈夫的记者招待会上，告诉他“凯文不肯睡觉”的情景。许多人为此担心：婚姻将给麦肯罗的网球生涯打上一个句号。伦德尔则说得比较明确：如果麦肯罗识时务，适时激流勇退的话，他将作为一个天才载入网球史册；否则，他连既得的名声也保不住。
    麦肯罗则不管什么名声不名声。他要打球，离开网球他简直无法想象自己的生活。人们大概正是喜欢上了他这股子倔犟劲，当然，其中也掺杂不少对衰落中的一代球王的同情，尽管麦肯罗在网球场上连连败北，但却越发偏爱起这个不走运的“坏孩子”来。每次大赛，无论它在哪里举行，只要麦肯罗一出现，球迷们的拉拉声便有了统一的方向。
    然而麦肯罗可不是为了得到人们的怜悯才继续打球的。他的目标是：重新称雄世界网坛，第四次摘取温布尔登男子单打的桂冠。
    要实现这个目标并非易事。“坏孩子”毕竟已年近30了，发球不再像过去那么锐不可挡，奔跑也总是比球慢一步，而世界网球水平的提高速度却是惊人的，这一点伦德尔没有说错。为了对付新一代运动员咄咄逼人的挑战，麦肯罗在教练的帮助下制定了严密的身体素质训练计划，并且像小学生一样认真地加以完成。这在过去是从来没有过的。此外，家庭生活并不像人们想象的那样只是“干扰”他的训练，在很大的程度上，它影响了“坏孩子”的性格，使他多了点父亲特有的随和和耐心。总之，许多熟悉麦肯罗的人都说，这两年他几乎变成了另外一个人——从“坏孩子”变成一个训练刻苦、脚踏实地的好运动员。
    艰苦的训练终于见到了成果。今年年初，麦肯罗在一系列重大比赛中频频取胜。在2月份举行的达拉斯世界网球锦标赛上，他战胜了多次对他出言不逊的老对手伦德尔，长长地舒了一口憋了两年的恶气，并且夺得了这次比赛的金牌。
    夺得温布尔登金牌的目标变近了，几乎到了伸手可及的地步，所有评论家也都把麦肯罗列为这次比赛最有可能的金牌得主之一。人们期望比赛能做出肯定的回答。遗憾的是，在扑向金牌的一刹那，麦肯罗还是比联邦德国的贝克尔“慢了一步”。使人们议论纷纷的是，这是否就是他在接球的奔跑中总要慢下的那一步呢？
