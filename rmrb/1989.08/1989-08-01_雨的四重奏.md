Title: Rain Quartet

Rain falls in fine strands, dampening my hair, the brown branches, the slopes by the bridge, and the thin stream that has endured a winter of drought.

Eyes brighten. Willows sprout new buds, plums bloom, and grass turns a vivid green. The stream, nourished, swells. Spring, with your delicate hand, comes swaying...

Listen to your whispers through the night, pattering softly.

Push open the window to see the courtyard strewn with fallen petals, red and scattered. You, so capricious, have vanished without a trace!

A thick curtain descends from the clouds, blocking out the sunlight, isolating the swallows, and transmitting only the faint rumble of thunder.

Finally, you tire and cease, reluctantly pierced by the sun's fiery gaze. The curtain evaporates into a faint cloud of smoke.

When you return with the seasonal winds, every silver thread of yours conducts heat and electricity.

Sometimes bold, sometimes stingy, sometimes melancholic, sometimes tender, and sometimes so vibrant.

No one can fathom your temperament. Have you grown worldly, or have we become shallow?

Yet, I always love to sit by the lamp, listening to you plucking the roof tiles and ridges like a wind chime. That is true elegance.

Willow branches turn yellow, and phoenix trees shed their leaves. Even the plump, glossy banana leaves do not turn into Cantonese music under your beat. But the wild honeysuckle in the suburbs grows even deeper green, and the wild chrysanthemums bloom in a riot of colors.

You persist, raining for days and nights without end.

No wonder some people feel melancholy, adding an extra quilt early. But they do not know that every drop you bring is a ripe fruit!

I always thought the snowflakes dancing in the sky were your soul manifest. Why do you act so frivolously and vainly?

The biting northwest wind drives away the sun, and you cannot hold your ground?

Without a trace of you, the withered fields yearn, their hearts cracked from longing. Swallows no longer coo in their nests, disappointed, seeking new love in the south. Even the cicadas, who always sing against you, shed their skins and burrow underground, unwilling to look at you again.

You are oblivious.

In one twilight, you finally arrive late, leaving a trail of moisture, then quietly depart.

It turns out, you just went on a journey to a distant place, not as unfeeling as imagined...

    雨的四重奏
    陈益
    丝丝缕缕，湿了额发，湿了褐色的裸条，湿了桥畔的坡岸，也湿了消瘦了一冬的小溪。
    双眸亮了。见柳吐嫩芽，梅绽新萼，草设明绿。溪流因滋润而丰满。春，搀着你的纤手袅袅婷婷地走来……
    听一夜你的絮语，淅淅沥沥。
    推窗看去，庭院里竟已是落英缤纷，残红遍地。任性的你却无影无踪！
    是一匹厚厚的帘子，从云罅垂挂而下。阻断阳光，隔绝飞燕，只传导隐隐雷声。
    你终于累乏了，消消停停了，无奈地被火球般的太阳穿越而过。帘子顿时烤成淡淡烟云。
    当你随着季风重返故里时，每一寸银色的纤维都传热导电。
    忽而豪爽，忽而吝啬，忽而抑郁，忽而缠绵，忽而又是那么鲜亮。
    谁也摸不清你的脾性。是因为你变得世故了，还是人变得肤浅了？
    可我总爱守在灯下，听你叮叮咚咚地弹拨着瓦楞和屋脊的风铃。那才叫清趣。
    柳条转黄了，梧桐叶落了。连肥厚油亮的芭蕉也不因你的敲打而成为广东音乐。但郊外的女贞愈加绿得深沉，野菊花们则被浇灌得五彩纷呈。
    你居然十分韧性，几日几夜不肯停歇。
    难怪有人滋生愁思，早早地添一袭寒衾。却不知你携来的每滴水珠，都是一枚成熟的浆果！
    总以为漫天飞舞的雪花就是你的灵魂化就。你为什么表现得这样轻浮和虚荣？
    凛冽砭骨的西北风逼退了骄阳，你也守不住自己的操节？
    不见你的踪迹，麦草萎黄的田畈者因思恋过度而心扉皲裂。燕子不再在巢中呢喃，失望地去南方另寻新欢。连始终和你唱反调的蝉儿，也弃了蝉衣，钻到地下，不愿再看你一眼。
    你浑然不知。
    在一个黄昏，你终于姗姗迟来，洒了一路温润，随即又悄然离去。
    原来，你只是去远方旅行了一次，并非臆想的那般薄情……
