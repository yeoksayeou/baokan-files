    Lixian County in Hebei Province has launched a special cleanup of "hotspot" issues that the public is most concerned about, focusing on curbing malpractice, misuse of public funds, and officials building private houses. This effort has significantly promoted the construction of a clean government.

    In April and May of this year, the Lixian County Committee organized a two-week "study and rectification" campaign in county-level departments. Following this, they initiated the "Building a Clean Government, Striving to Be an Honest Official, and Contributing to the People" campaign, guiding everyone to reflect on their own and their unit's actual situations.

    Based on this, the Lixian County Committee targeted the most severe corruption issues that the public is most concerned about for "special cleanup." Through joint efforts from top to bottom, four issues have been initially or thoroughly cleaned up. First, the issue of malpractice in professional title evaluations. Four hundred ninety-three unqualified individuals have been removed or corrected, accounting for 23.6% of the total number of people who received professional titles in the county over the past year. Second, the issue of improperly occupying public funds. Currently, 276 officials and staff members have returned the occupied public funds, totaling over 230,000 yuan. Third, the issue of malpractice in recruitment. Through re-examination, three individuals who recently passed the exam but did not meet the recruitment conditions had their employment qualifications revoked; six individuals who took the exam for others have been reported to the disciplinary and supervisory departments for necessary party and administrative disciplinary actions. Fourth, the issue of officials and staff building private houses. The county committee clearly stated: regardless of the level, whoever has issues will be investigated, and the work has started from county-level officials. This work is currently underway.

    蠡县专项清理“热点”问题
    大刹舞弊、乱占公款、干部建私房等歪风
    本报讯  河北省蠡县县委从思想教育入手，抓住群众关心的“热点”问题进行专项清理，促进了廉政建设。
    今年四五月份，蠡县县委在县直机关组织了为期半个月的“学习整风”，进而开展
  “建设廉政机关、争当廉洁干部、为人民建功立业”活动，引导大家联系自身及本单位实际自查反思。
    在此基础上，蠡县县委针对群众最为关心的、存有严重腐败问题的“热点”进行“专项清理”。经过上下共同努力，目前已有四个问题得以初步或彻底清理。一是职称评聘舞弊问题。有四百九十三名不合格者被清理或纠正，占去年以来全县获得职称人员总数的百分之二十三点六。二是非正常全占用公款问题。目前已有二百七十六名干部职工归还了占用的公款，总计二十三万多元。三是招干舞弊问题。通过复审，对近期已通过考试的三名不符合招干条件的人员取消了录用资格；对六名在考场中替他人参考的人员已提请纪检、监察部门给予必要的党纪、政纪处分。四是干部职工建私房问题。县委明确提出：不管是哪级干部，谁有问题就查谁，并已开始从县级干部清起。目前该项工作正在进行中。（李伟  根永  郁思）
