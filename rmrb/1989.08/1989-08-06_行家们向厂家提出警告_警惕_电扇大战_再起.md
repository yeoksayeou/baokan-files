    Experts Warn Manufacturers: Beware of a Repeat of the "Fan War"

    According to a report in today's issue of "Market News," after experiencing three major "fan wars" in 1979, 1982, and 1986, China's electric fan industry has undergone continuous self-adjustment. The number of production plants has decreased from over 2,000 to around 300, and the annual production volume has stabilized at over 40 million units in recent years. This year, while the sales of other household appliances such as color TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, and VCRs have declined, electric fans continue to sell well. Some manufacturers have resumed production.

    Experts believe that the strong sales of electric fans this year are due to multiple factors. Among the six major categories of household electrical appliances, only electric fans are not subject to group purchasing controls, allowing government agencies, enterprises, and institutions to purchase them for cooling and heat relief. For urban and rural residents, electric fans are essential for staying cool.

    In previous years, China exported about 40 million electric fans annually. Last year, the export volume doubled to 80 million units, and this year's exports are expected to maintain last year's level. This is another reason for the strong sales of electric fans.

    However, behind the "hot" sales of electric fans, there are also concerns. Due to the high commercial profits from selling electric fans, the profit margin from the factory to wholesale is 12%, and from wholesale to retail, it increases by another 12%. With multiple layers of transactions and intense competition, according to a survey by relevant departments, nearly half of the 40 million electric fans produced in China in previous years were stuck in commercial inventory. Last summer's prolonged high temperatures led to a buying spree, which once again stimulated commercial sales enthusiasm, with businesses competing to stock up and increase inventory. In reality, a significant number of electric fans have not yet reached consumers. Therefore, manufacturers must not act rashly and blindly expand production.

### 行家们向厂家提出警告  警惕“电扇大战”再起

    行家们向厂家提出警告
    警惕“电扇大战”再起
    本报讯　针对今年出现的电扇生产过热情况，行家们及时提醒：警惕“电扇大战”重演。
    据今天出版的《市场报》报道，我国电扇行业经过1979、1982和1986年3次大战之后，不断进行自我调整，生产厂由2000多家减少到300多家，产量近几年一直稳定在4000多万台。今年以来，在彩电、冰箱、洗衣机、录像机等家用电器销售走下坡路的情况下，电扇仍然保持旺销势头。一些厂家又开始恢复生产电扇。
    行家们认为，电扇今年旺销原因是多方面的。在冰箱、彩电、空调等6大类家电产品中，唯独电扇不属集团控购范围，机关、企事业单位都可购置用于防暑降温。对城乡居民来说，电扇是必备的纳凉用品。
    前几年我国电扇出口每年400万台，去年出口量翻了一番，达800万台，今年出口可望保持去年的水平。这是电扇旺销的另一个原因。
    然而，在电扇“热”的背后也有隐忧。因为经销电扇商业利润高，出厂到批发，利润12％，批发到零售，利润又加12％，层层转手，多家竞销。据有关部门调查，我国前几年每年生产的4000多万台电扇中，几乎有一半库存积压在商业部门。去年夏季持续高温，继而出现抢购风，又一次刺激了商业销售的积极性，纷纷争相进货，填补和增加库存量。实际上，现在有相当数量的电扇并没有卖到消费者手里。因而，厂家切不可头脑发热，盲目扩大产量。
