Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, August 20th

The 19th European Swimming Championships concluded today here, with athletes from the German Democratic Republic (GDR) securing the top spot in the overall standings.

The competition, which began on August 12th, featured over 1,500 male and female athletes competing in 43 events across swimming, diving, water polo, and synchronized swimming. GDR athletes won 16 gold medals, 11 silver medals, and 11 bronze medals, leading the overall standings. However, out of the 16 gold medals, 15 were won by female athletes, and none of the events saw a world record broken.

Soviet athletes secured 6 gold, 10 silver, and 6 bronze medals, placing second in the overall standings. The French team came in third with 4 gold, 4 silver, and 1 bronze medal. The West German team, with 3 gold, 3 silver, and 3 bronze medals, saw a decline in performance compared to the previous edition, trailing behind Italy (4 gold, 1 silver, 6 bronze) and Hungary (3 gold, 4 silver, 1 bronze).

Although Italian athlete Gio Lanberti and British athlete A. Moorhouse set world records in the men's 200-meter freestyle and 100-meter breaststroke respectively during this championship, local commentators noted that the number of world records set paled in comparison to those achieved at the ongoing Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Tokyo.

    欧洲游泳锦标赛结束
    新华社波恩8月20日电  （记者翁振葆）第19届欧洲游泳锦标赛今天在这里降下了帷幕，民主德国选手夺得总分第一名。
    本届比赛是从8月12日开始的，有1500多名男女运动员参加了游泳、跳水、水球和花样游泳共43个项目的角逐。民主德国选手获得了16枚金牌、11枚银牌、11枚铜牌，总分遥遥领先。但16枚金牌中有15枚是女选手所得，没有一项打破世界纪录。
    苏联选手获得6金、10银和6铜，总分居第二位。法国队以4金、4银、1铜居第三位。联邦德国队获得金、银、铜牌各3枚，成绩比上一届下降，位居意大利队（4金、1银、6铜）和匈牙利队（3金、4银、1铜）之后。
    虽然本届锦标赛期间意大利人乔·兰贝蒂和英国人艾·穆尔豪斯分别创造了男子200米自由泳和100米蛙泳世界纪录，但是，此间舆论认为，同目前在东京举行的泛太平洋地区游泳锦标赛创造的众多世界纪录相比，未免有点黯然失色。
