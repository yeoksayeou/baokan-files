    Strengthening Internal Constraints and External Supervision: Cangzhou and Anqing Tax Bureaus Take Strict Measures

    Qí Yùlín, Director of the Cangzhou City Tax Bureau in Hebei, writes: Due to the nature of tax work, some units and individuals try every means to offer benefits to tax officials to avoid or reduce tax payments. Therefore, cultivating honest and clean tax officials is very important.

    According to regulations, tax officials are not allowed to accept lavish meals or gifts during tax inspections, but this practice persists. To address this, our bureau sent an open letter to the units being inspected, stipulating the following: 1. Tax inspections will be conducted openly. We will insist on civilized inspections, act according to the law, not show favoritism, and not accept meals, entertainment, or any gifts; 2. We will seriously listen to opinions and suggestions from all sides; 3. We welcome supervision of enterprises' tax payments and tax officials' law enforcement and discipline. We have published the tax bureau's supervision hotline. We printed the "Open Letter" on banners and made them into couplets. Tax officials must carry these when conducting inspections in enterprises and hang them up to accept supervision.

    Dǒng Jīnyú from the Propaganda Department of the Anqing City Committee in Anhui writes: To strengthen self-discipline, our city's tax bureau conducts a week-long tax wind and discipline education session every spring, focusing on tax system units and county bureaus. During these sessions, we summarize and exchange experiences in building a clean government, check for issues such as embezzlement, accepting bribes, using personal connections to replace the law, and causing tax losses. Once any illegal or disciplinary issues are discovered, they are promptly investigated and dealt with. Since 1988, the entire city's tax system has received 285 reports of tax officials' disciplinary issues, of which 264 have been investigated and dealt with. Sixteen individuals have received administrative penalties, been criticized in public announcements, or had their position allowances deducted. In August of last year, a tax official from the suburban district bureau lent 2,000 yuan to a relative to buy a refrigerator at an enterprise under his jurisdiction, causing a negative impact. After receiving the report, the bureau's leadership had him make a self-criticism at the party branch meeting, immediately return the loan, and apologize to the enterprise. His position allowance was also deducted. A tax official from the county-level tax bureau in Susong County was reported for participating in a meal during a tax inspection. The county bureau immediately investigated and ordered him to pay back the meal fee of 7.74 yuan.

    This mechanism of self-discipline combined with internal and external supervision has promoted the clean governance of tax officials, reducing instances of using tax for personal gain and replacing the law with personal connections.

    强化内部制约和外部监督  沧州安庆税务局措施严厉
    河北沧州市税务局局长祁玉林来信：由于税务工作的特点，一些单位和个人为了少交纳或不交纳税款，就千方百计想给税务干部一些好处。所以，培养清正廉洁的税务干部很重要。
    按纪律，税务干部检查税收时不准大吃大拿，但久禁不止。为此，我局向被检查单位送去公开信，规定：1、税务检查公开。坚持文明检查，依法办事，不徇私情，不得接受吃喝招待和各种馈赠；2、认真听取各方面的意见和建议；3、欢迎对企业的纳税情况和税务干部的执法遵纪情况给予监督。公布了税务局的监督电话。我们将《公开信》印在条幅上，制成挂联，税务人员下企业检查必须携带，张挂在企业，接受监督。
    安徽安庆市委宣传部董金余来信：我市税务局为加强自我约束，每年春节后，以市区分局和县局为单位集中一周时间进行税风税纪教育，总结交流廉政建设体会，检查贪污受贿、以税谋私、以情代法、损失税款等问题，一旦发现违法违纪现象，便严肃查处。1988年以来，全市税务系统接到举报税务干部违纪线索285起，已查处264起，有16人分别受到行政处分和通报批评、扣发岗位酬金。去年8月，郊区分局一税务干部在分管区一企业私借2000元给亲戚买冰箱，造成不良影响。接到举报后，分局领导责其在支部大会做检查，立即返还了借款，并向企业赔礼道歉，还扣发了这个同志的岗位酬金。宿松县直税所一税干在税务检查中参与吃请被程集区一人举报后，县局立即进行了查处，令其补交了就餐费7.74元。
    这种以自我约束为主、内外结合的监督机制，促进了税务人员自身的廉政建设，减少了以税营私，以情代法现象的发生。
