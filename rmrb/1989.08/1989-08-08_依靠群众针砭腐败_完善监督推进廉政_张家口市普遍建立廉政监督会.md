In the border city of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, there are active grassroots organizations known as the "Clean Governance Construction Workers' Supervision Union." These organizations, through various channels and methods, criticize corruption, reflect the voice of the masses, and propose suggestions for clean governance, effectively promoting the clean governance of party and government organs and leading cadres.

The "Clean Governance Construction Workers' Supervision Union" in Zhangjiakou City appeared in March of this year. They rely on various levels of trade union organizations and enterprise and institutional worker congresses, in accordance with the constitution, using methods such as consultation, dialogue, criticism, suggestions, and reports, to cooperate with the discipline inspection, supervision, and news units to supervise the clean governance of leading organs and cadres. For example: serious cases of using power for personal gain and infringing on the interests of the state, collective, and the masses; cases of bribery, using power to protect and harbor lawbreakers; cases of embezzlement, extortion, and blackmail; cases of fabricating false information, exaggerating achievements, and deceiving for fame and profit; cases of using power for speculation, buying and selling; cases of serious bureaucratism and dereliction of duty, etc.

The Supervision Union has played an important role in the construction of clean governance. They have set up report boxes, report stations, and report hotlines in various supervision agencies, established systems for receiving letters and visits from the masses and legal consultations, encouraged the masses to report, reflected the opinions of the masses, and protected the legal rights of reporters. The Supervision Union has formed a wide range of mass supervision networks. The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government issued several regulations on clean governance last year, but after publication, the masses felt they were not comprehensive or avoided the key issues. The Supervision Union reflected the opinions of the masses through dialogue, and the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government immediately revised and improved the regulations. This year, in the military recruitment work in Xuanhua District, according to the requirements of the Supervision Union, the 70-plus reports from the masses were all investigated and verified, and the new recruits were made to appear publicly on the television screen, effectively preventing "relationship soldiers" and "backdoor soldiers." The Public Security Bureau of Qiaodong District, with the participation and support of the workers' supervision organization, was the first in the city to implement the "rural-to-urban" open system, publicly posting the "rural-to-urban" objects, greatly increasing the transparency of this "hot" and "difficult" work, and receiving praise from the masses.

    依靠群众针砭腐败　完善监督推进廉政
    张家口市普遍建立廉政监督会
    本报石家庄电　在塞外山城河北省张家口市，活跃着一个个倡廉反腐的群众性组织——“廉政建设职工监督联合会”。这些组织通过多种渠道和形式，针砭腐败现象，反映群众呼声，提出廉政建议，有力地促进了党政机关和领导干部的廉政建设。
    张家口市“廉政建设职工监督联合会”出现于今年3月。它们以各级工会组织和企事业单位职代会为依托，按照宪法规定，用协商对话、批评建议、举报控告等多种手段，配合纪检、监察等职能部门和新闻单位，对领导机关和领导干部进行廉政监督。如：严重以权谋私和侵犯国家、集体和群众利益的行为；贪赃枉法，以权纵容、包庇违法乱纪的行为；贪污受贿，敲诈勒索行为；弄虚作假，虚报浮夸，骗取名利的行为；仗权投机倒把，倒买倒卖行为；严重官僚主义、弄权渎职行为等等。
    监督联合会已在廉政建设中发挥了重要作用。他们在各监督机构设举报信箱、举报站和举报电话，建立群众来信、来访和法律顾问接待日制度，鼓励群众举报，反映群众意见，维护举报人的合法权益。监督联合会处处把关，形成了较大范围的群众性监督网络。市委、市政府去年曾作出廉政建设的若干规定，但公布后群众认为不全面或避重就轻。监督联合会通过对话把群众意见反映上去，市委、市政府立即对规定进行了修改和完善。今年，宣化区在征兵工作中根据监督联合会的要求，将群众70多起举报一一查证核实，还让新兵征选对象在电视屏幕上公开“亮相”，有效地杜绝了“人情兵”和“后门兵”。桥东区公安分局在职工监督机构的参与支持下，在全市率先实行“农转非”公开制度，将“农转非”对象张榜公布，大大增强了这一“热点”、“难点”工作的透明度，受到了群众的好评。
