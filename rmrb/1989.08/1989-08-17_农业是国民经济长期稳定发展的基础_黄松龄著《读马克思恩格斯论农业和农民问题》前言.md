The posthumous work "Reading Marx and Engels on Agriculture and Peasant Issues" by Comrade Huang Songling (published by Hubei People's Publishing House) is another monograph on agriculture and peasant issues following his "Huang Songling's Manuscripts on Socialist Economic Issues" (compiled by the Economic Research Institute of the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences and the Political Economy Teaching and Research Office of the Central Party School, published by Tianjin People's Publishing House in 1980). Huang Songling was born in November 1898, and this year marks the 90th anniversary of his birth. The editing and publication of this book to commemorate and honor this late renowned economist and old revolutionary of our Party has significant meaning.

Comrade Huang Songling's research in economic theory covered a wide range, with a particular focus on agriculture and peasant issues. As early as his youth, he conducted extensive research on the rural and peasant issues in China and the Soviet Union, publishing numerous articles on these topics. During the Great Revolution, he taught courses on peasants and land issues as a political instructor at the Central Political and Military Academy and the Central Peasant Movement Training Institute. In the mid-1930s, he organized the "Land Problem Research Society" among progressive students in some universities in Beijing, guiding them to understand the nature and significance of the peasant revolution. Especially after 1958, recognizing the crucial role of agriculture and peasant issues in China's socialist construction, he conducted in-depth investigations of the actual situation in China's rural areas. At the same time, he devoted considerable time and effort to systematically studying Marx and Engels' views on agriculture and peasant issues. In 1961, in his article "The Direction of Current Agricultural Development," he pointed out: "The classic writers of Marxism have always attached great importance to agricultural issues, believing that human beings entered true productive labor from agriculture. The agricultural production process is a process of material exchange between humans and nature through their activities. Once people engage in agricultural production, their lives begin to stabilize and have initial guarantees, and all economic and cultural development has a foundation. The level of agricultural labor productivity determines the extent to which people can participate in other activities, thus determining the level of all economic and cultural development." In 1962, he emphasized in his speech "What is Socialism": "Agriculture as the foundation is a long-term policy issue. Even if agriculture accounts for only 1% in the ratio of industry to agriculture, it is still the foundation. People cannot live without food; agriculture is the foundation of people's livelihood. This does not necessarily manifest in the ratio of industry to agriculture. For example, in the United States, it has a lot of grain, but its agriculture still accounts for less than 10% in the ratio of industry to agriculture. Furthermore, if the level of agricultural production is too low and there is no surplus labor to provide, then industry cannot develop. Therefore, agriculture as the foundation means that agriculture must be overcome." In his posthumous work "Reading Marx and Engels on Agriculture and Peasant Issues," he adhered to the materialist view of history in Marxism, regarding the development of productive forces as the ultimate cause of human society's existence and development, and systematically expounded on agriculture and peasant issues.

Studying Comrade Huang Songling's posthumous work is of great practical significance for us in the process of deepening comprehensive reforms, adhering to the standard of productive forces, and further recognizing the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy under new historical conditions. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized: "Agriculture is the foundation, do not forget it," "There are many issues in agriculture, and we have not yet solved them." The 13th Party Congress pointed out: Agriculture is an extremely important issue related to the overall situation of construction and reform, and it is the foundation for the long-term stable development of the entire national economy. At the rural work conference held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on November 3, 1988, it was also reminded: "Our country's agricultural foundation is still fragile. It should be seen that the agricultural issue is not a local issue, but a comprehensive issue; it is not a general economic issue, but a major economic strategic issue, and also a political issue. Therefore, it is necessary to make a decision, exert effort, invest money, and strive to develop agriculture." It can be seen that doing a good job in agricultural production is of great strategic significance for balancing the contradiction between total demand and total supply, for rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, deepening comprehensive reforms, and ensuring the long-term stable development of the national economy. Comrade Huang Songling's posthumous work is a rare textbook to help us understand the principles of Marxism on agricultural issues and the spirit of the central authorities.

    农业是国民经济长期稳定发展的基础
    黄松龄著《读马克思恩格斯论农业和农民问题》前言
    宋涛
    黄松龄同志的遗著《读马克思恩格斯论农业和农民问题》（湖北人民出版社出版），是继他的《黄松龄社会主义经济问题遗稿》（天津社会科学院经济研究所与中共中央党校政治经济学教研室编选，天津人民出版社1980年出版）之后的另一部关于农业和农民问题的专著。黄松龄同志生于1898年11月，今年是他诞辰90周年，以此书的编辑与出版，来纪念和缅怀这位已故的著名经济学家、我们党的老一辈无产阶级革命家，具有重大意义。
    黄松龄同志在经济理论研究中，探索的范围较广，其中关于农业和农民问题的探讨较深。早在青年时代，他对中国和苏联的农村和农民问题就进行过较多的研究，发表过不少关于这类问题的文章。大革命时期，在中央政治军事学校和中央农民运动讲习所任政治教官时讲授过农民和土地问题。30年代中期，在北京的一些大学的进步学生中组织了“土地问题研究会”，引导他们认识农民革命的性质和意义。特别是从1958年以后，他鉴于农业和农民问题在我国社会主义建设中所处的重要地位，一方面深入我国农村进行实际情况的调查，同时又用较多的时间和精力，系统地研究了马克思恩格斯关于农业和农民问题的论述。1961年，他在《当前农业发展的方向》一文中指出：“马克思主义经典作家，历来都十分重视农业问题，认为人类进入真正意义上的生产劳动是从农业开始的。农业生产过程是人类通过自己的活动，向自然界进行物质交换的过程。当人们进入农业生产活动后，人的生活开始走向稳定，并有了初步的保障，一切经济文化的发展才有了基础。农业劳动生产率的发展程度，决定人们参加其他活动的程度，从而决定一切经济文化的发展程度。”1962年，他又在《什么是社会主义》的讲话中强调：“农业为基础是个长期的方针性问题，在工农业比重中，哪怕农业只占1％也是基础。人不吃饭是不行的，农业为民生之本。这并不一定表现在工农比重方面，例如美国，它的粮食很多，而它的农业在工农业比重中还占不到10％。再说，如果农业生产水平太低，没有剩余劳动可以提供，那么工业也就发展不了。所以农业为基础就是要农业过关。”他在《读马克思恩格斯论农业和农民问题》这部遗稿中，坚持了马克思主义的唯物史观，以生产力发展为人类社会存在和发展的终极原因，全面系统地对农业和农民问题进行了阐述。
    学习黄松龄同志的这部遗稿，对于我们在全面深化改革的过程中，坚持生产力标准，进一步认识在新的历史条件下农业在整个国民经济中的基础地位，有着重大的现实意义。邓小平同志曾多次强调：“农业是根本，不要忘掉”，“农业文章很多，我们还没有破题”。党的十三大指出：农业是关系建设和改革全局的极端重要的问题，是整个国民经济长期稳定发展的基础。1988年11月3日，中共中央、国务院召开的农村工作会议也提醒我们：“我国农业这个基础还是脆弱的。应该看到，农业问题，决不是局部问题，而是一个事关全局的问题；不是一般经济工作问题，而是一个重大的经济战略问题，也是一个政治问题。因此，必须下决心、花力气、下本钱大力发展农业。”可见，搞好农业生产，对于平衡总需求和总供给的矛盾，对于治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革，保证国民经济长期稳定地发展，都具有重大的战略意义。黄松龄同志的这部遗作，是一本帮助我们领略马克思主义关于农业问题原则和中央精神的难得的教材。
