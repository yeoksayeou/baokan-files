Liao Ning Begins to See Results in Combating Corruption
Leaders Tackle Major Cases, Encourage Citizens to Sue Officials

People's Daily, Shenyang - Reporter Duan Xinqiang reports: The Liao Ning Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have mobilized the masses to expose corrupt practices, encouraged citizens to sue officials, and had leading cadres personally handle major cases. Initial results have been achieved in combating corruption. So far, the province has uncovered 2,332 cases of disciplinary violations, including 628 economic cases, 354 major cases of power for personal gain, and 79 cases of bureaucratism causing huge losses. A total of 1,212 party members have been disciplined, including 75 county-level cadres and 6 department-level cadres.

The relocation section chief of the Dalian Urban Construction Development Company, Yu Mingkuan, along with three others, hid rooms multiple times while selling commercial housing and privately sold them, obtaining illicit funds of 358,000 yuan and privately dividing them. After the masses exposed this, the issue was not resolved for a long time. The municipal party committee and government leaders personally "handled" this case, which then proceeded smoothly.

In handling corrupt practices, Liao Ning Province has paid special attention to the role of the procuratorate, public security, and courts. For corrupt practices that violate the law, cases have been promptly filed and investigated. An executive of the Dalian Civil Aviation Bureau, Wei Fuxing, engaged in illegal buying and selling for personal gain. After the procuratorate investigated, he was taken into custody. From his home, 34 gold rings, 4 gold earrings, 92,000 yuan in cash, 35,000 yuan in foreign exchange certificates, and over 4,000 Hong Kong dollars were seized. The deputy director of the Liao He Chemical Factory, Bai Hongyuan, and the deputy mayor of Liao Yang County, Wang Xiaozhang, were both arrested and taken into custody for bribery.

    辽宁惩治腐败初见成效
    领导抓大案　鼓励民告官
    本报沈阳电　记者段心强报道：辽宁省委、省政府发动群众揭发腐败现象，鼓励民告官，领导干部亲自抓大案，惩治腐败初步取得成果。到目前为止，全省已查出违纪案件2332起，其中经济案件628起，重大以权谋私案件354起，官僚主义造成巨额损失案件79起。处分党员1212人，其中县级干部75人，厅局级干部6人。
    大连城建开发公司动迁科长于明宽伙同其他3人在出售商品房时多次隐匿房间，私自变卖，获得赃款35.8万元，私自分掉。群众揭发后迟迟不能解决。市委、市政府领导亲自“包”这个案子，才使办案顺利进行。
    辽宁省在查处腐败现象时，十分注意发挥公、检、法的作用，对于触犯法律的腐败现象，及时立案查处。大连民航的一个经理魏福兴，倒买倒卖牟取暴利。检察院查实后将他收审，从他家搜出非法所得的金戒指34个，金耳环4个，现金9.2万元，外汇券3.5万元，港币4000多元。辽化二厂副厂长白洪源和辽阳县副县长王孝昌因受贿问题分别被捕和被收审。
