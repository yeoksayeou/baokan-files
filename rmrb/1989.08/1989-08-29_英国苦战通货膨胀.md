British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson recently stated that the annual inflation rate of 8.3% has peaked. The implication is that Britain's inflation has begun to decline.

Indeed, according to statistics released by the British Central Statistical Office on the 14th, Britain's total retail sales in July were 0.6% lower than in June and below the average for the first half of the year. This is the second consecutive month of decline, following a 1.8% drop in June compared to May. Analysts believe this indicates that overheated consumer demand is beginning to be curbed, and "the government's anti-inflation plan is taking effect."

Britain had previously succeeded in controlling inflation, but over the past year, it has once again been plagued by inflation. Ten years ago, the Thatcher government made controlling inflation its primary economic policy goal. After several years of effort, the inflation rate had dropped from 21.9% in May 1980 to 2.4% in June-July 1986. However, since the end of 1987, inflation has resurfaced and risen steadily to 8.3% in June this year. Inflation has once again become a wild horse, causing the Thatcher government considerable headaches and making it difficult to control.

The resurgence of inflation in Britain is closely linked to its domestic and international economic environment.

Domestically, excessive investment and consumer demand are the primary causes of inflation. According to British official statistics, the growth rate of fixed capital investment in 1987 and 1988 was more than double that of the previous two years; the increase in consumption expenditure was nearly equal to the increase in investment expenditure, both around £13 billion. The growth in investment and consumption expenditure naturally leads to price increases.

Inflation is also related to the uncontrolled growth of the money supply. In recent years, due to the development of financial liberalization in Britain, various banks and non-bank financial institutions have competed to lend money, and various new financial instruments have emerged, leading to an accelerated growth in the money supply. The decline in oil prices has lowered Britain's inflation rate, masking the need to control the money supply and the rapidly growing domestic demand.

At the same time, the Conservative government's budgets in the early years of its administration all included significant tax cuts, which greatly stimulated personal consumption and brought about the largest "consumer boom" since the 1970s.

Internationally, global inflation is also a factor influencing Britain's inflation. According to statistics, the average inflation rate of the seven major Western industrialized countries rose from 3.1% in June last year to 4.8% in June this year; due to factors such as rising global food prices, the entire OECD member countries are expected to see an inflation rate increase of one percentage point this year compared to last year. Britain, which has had a significant trade deficit in recent years, is undoubtedly also affected.

In its efforts to control inflation, the Thatcher government has spared no effort. Its main policy measures are:

1. Raising interest rates. From June last year to May 24 this year, there have been 12 increases, with interest rates reaching 14%. The budget for this fiscal year also states that interest rates will be maintained at around 13%.

2. Slowing down the long-term goal of reducing personal income tax to 20% to reduce consumption stimulation, and reducing the growth rate of domestic demand from 6.5% last year to 2.5% this year and 1.5% in the first half of next year.

3. Continuing to strictly control public sector spending.

4. Controlling the money supply. The growth rate of the money supply has been reduced from 7% in the previous fiscal year to 1-5% in this fiscal year. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson emphasized that this is "the fundamental measure to control inflation."

It is estimated that starting from the second half of this year, Britain's inflation rate will gradually and slowly decline, reaching around 6% by the end of the year. However, due to increased employment and rising average personal incomes, many industries have agreed on wage increases of 8.8% or more. Economists believe that for the government to achieve its medium-term plan of reducing the inflation rate from 8.3% to 2.5%, it is necessary to slow down the growth rate of labor costs. This shows that the British government's task of controlling total demand and thus controlling inflation remains quite arduous.

### 英国苦战通货膨胀

    英国苦战通货膨胀
    本报记者　陈特安
    英国财政大臣劳森最近说，8.3％的通货膨胀年率已经见顶。其潜台词是，英国的通货膨胀已经开始下降。
    的确，据英国中央统计局14日公布的统计数字，英国7月份的零售总额比6月份下降了0.6％，并低于上半年的平均数。这是继6月份零售额比5月份下降1.8％后连续第二个月下降。分析家认为，这表明过热的消费需求已开始受到抑制，“政府反通货膨胀的计划正在发挥作用”。
    英国曾成功地控制通货膨胀，但一年多来又重新受到通货膨胀的困扰。10年前玛·撒切尔政府以控制通货膨胀作为首要经济政策目标，经过几年的努力，通货膨胀率已从1980年5月份的21.9％下降到1986年6至7月份的2.4％，但自1987年底以来，通货膨胀又卷土重来，节节回升到今年6月份的8.3％。通货膨胀又成为桀骜不驯的脱缰之马，令玛·撒切尔政府深感头痛，难以驾驭。
    通货膨胀在英国复燃，这同英国经济的国内和国际环境是分不开的。
    从国内环境看，国内投资和消费需求过大是导致通货膨胀的主要原因。据英国官方统计，1987年和1988年的固定资本投资增长率比上两年的增长率高出一倍多；消费支出的增长额与投资支出的增长额接近，均在130亿英镑左右。投资和消费支出的增长自然会导致物价的上涨。
    通货膨胀还与货币供应量增长失控有关。近年来，由于英国金融自由化的发展，各种银行和非银行金融机构竞相贷款，各种新的金融工具层出不穷，从而造成货币供应量增长加快。石油价格的下跌则拉低了英国的通货膨胀率，掩盖了控制货币量和迅速增长的国内需求的必要性。
    同时，保守党政府在执政初期的几个预算中都采取了较大幅度减税措施，从而大大刺激了个人消费，带来70年代以来最大的“消费繁荣”。
    从国际环境看，世界性的通货膨胀也是影响英国通货膨胀的一个因素。据统计，西方七大工业国的平均通货膨胀率从去年6月的3.1％上升到今年6月的4.8％；由于受到世界食品价格上涨等因素的影响，整个经合组织成员国预计今年的通货膨胀率也比去年上升一个百分点。近年来有较大贸易逆差的英国，无疑也要受到影响。
    在想方设法控制通货膨胀方面，玛·撒切尔政府可谓不遗余力。其主要政策手段是：
    一、调升利率。从去年6月到今年5月24日，已调升12次，利率高达14％，本财政年度的预算也称要把利率保持在13％左右的水平上。
    二、放慢将个人所得税减至20％的长期目标，以减少消费刺激，并把国内需求的增长率由去年的6.5％减至今年的2.5％和明年上半年的1.5％。
    三、继续严格控制公共部门开支。
    四、控制货币供应量。货币供应量的增长率由上个财政年度的7％减至本财政年度的1—5％。财政大臣劳森强调，这是“控制通货膨胀的根本措施”。
    据估计，从今年下半年开始，英国的通货膨胀率将逐步缓慢下降，到年底约下降至6％左右。但是，由于就业增加而个人平均收入也随之增加，许多行业劳资双方达成的工资增长幅度均在8.8％以上，而经济学家认为，政府要实现通货膨胀率从8.3％降至2.5％的中期计划，放慢劳动成本的增长幅度是必要的，由此可见，英国政府要控制总需求从而控制通货膨胀仍然相当艰巨。
