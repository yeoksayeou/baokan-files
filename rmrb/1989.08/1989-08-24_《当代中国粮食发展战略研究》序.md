In recent years, the economic sector has conducted strategic research on the long-term and comprehensive issue of food, which is very meaningful.

Food is the foundation of life, and grains are the primary source of food. This is likely to remain unchanged in China for a long time. Although there are many types of food, grains are the basic staple and the foundation of people's livelihood. Moreover, without grains, modern food and brewing industries would be like a river without a source; without grains, the feed industry would be like a kitchen without rice; without grains, adjusting the rural industrial structure would lack necessary conditions. Abundant grains mean increased agriculture, a thriving market, and a stable economy. This has been repeatedly proven by historical experience. From ancient times, there has been the saying "with enough food comes a strong army," and in modern times, grains remain an important strategic material for national defense. All of this shows that grains are still a treasure in China, related to the continuous, stable, and coordinated development of the economy, and undoubtedly, research on the development strategy of this basic industry has strategic significance for the entire national life and economy.

In a country as populous and vast as China, researching the food development strategy is a systematic project. It should not be confined to a simple buying and selling perspective, focusing solely on grains, but should start from the overall national economy. Solving China's food problem requires continuous production as the foundation, activating circulation as the key, and rational consumption as the basis. A complete food strategy should not isolate circulation from other factors but should include production, circulation, and consumption as organic components. Starting from a rational consumption structure, adjusting and optimizing the industrial structure, and establishing a circulation structure that adapts to both, including the intermediary role of the grain business.

According to research and verification by relevant experts, to enable the Chinese people to achieve a moderately prosperous life by the end of this century, the total demand for grains should be at least 500 billion kilograms. This is a strategically challenging task. However, it is also a necessary and achievable strategic task. As long as correct policies are adopted, advanced science and technology are utilized, and necessary investments are made, it should be possible to achieve the strategic goal of grains reaching a new level.

To improve grain circulation, it is necessary to continue deepening reforms in the direction of combining planned economy with market regulation. Based on China's basic national conditions of a large population, limited arable land, and constrained grain resources, at least in the near and medium term, grain circulation can only be implemented through a "dual-track system," that is, the state plans to purchase a certain amount of grain, and urban residents' grain rations are guaranteed by planned supply; grains outside the state's planned purchase quantity are regulated by the market. To ensure that grain circulation is active and orderly, it is necessary to establish and improve a market with organizational, open, and competitive characteristics, including the establishment of a small number of grain wholesale markets, gradually realizing the standardization of grain trading behavior. Through steady reform, ultimately establish a new grain circulation system with state-owned grain businesses as the main channel and other necessary channels as auxiliary channels.

Food, and even food consumption, should occupy an important position in the grain strategy. Due to national conditions and grain resource constraints, China can only adopt a moderate consumption strategy in this stage, and blindly advocating high consumption is more harmful than beneficial. Eating three meals a day seems to be a very ordinary thing, but eating contains rich cultural and scientific knowledge. People eat to obtain necessary nutrients, ensure a strong physique, prolong life, be energetic, and work effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a scientific food structure that suits national conditions and cannot simply copy the food structure dominated by animal food in the West. In ancient China, there was the proposal of a food structure of "five grains for nourishment, five livestock for benefit, five fruits for assistance, and five vegetables for supplementation." We should, on the one hand, carry forward the advantages of our country's food structure, and on the other hand, learn from the strengths of the Western food structure, complementing each other to establish a frugal and scientific food structure for China.

Solving the food problem for a country with more than a billion people is a very arduous strategic task. The long-term situation of China's grains is not surplus but shortage. Generally speaking, the grain problem should not be overly optimistic or pessimistic. Objectively, we have both heavy pressure and great potential. In the total arable land area of the country, 2/3 of the arable land is still medium and low-yield fields, with great potential for increase. While increasing the production of gramineous grains, it is important to expand food resources, develop grass-eating animals, aquaculture, woody grains and oils, which are very important for solving China's grain problem.

    《当代中国粮食发展战略研究》序
    胡平
    近几年来，经济界对关系长远性、全局性的粮食问题进行战略研究，这是很有意义的。
    民以食为天，食以粮为主源。这在我国恐怕长期难有大变。固然，食物有多种多样，但粮食是基础性食料，是民生之本。还有，没有粮食，现代食品、酿造业便成为无源之水；没有粮食，饲料工业会变成无米之炊；没有粮食，调整农村产业结构会失去必要条件。粮食丰，农业增，市场兴，经济稳定。这为历史经验反复证明。自古有足食强兵之说，到现代粮食仍然是对巩固国防具有重要意义的军用战略物资。所有这些说明，粮食在我国仍然是宝中之宝，关系到经济持续、稳定、协调发展，不失为基础产业地位。无疑，研究这项基础产业的发展战略，对整个国民生活与国民经济具有战略意义。
    在人口如此众多、地域如此辽阔的我国，研究粮食发展战略，是一个系统工程，不可囿于单纯购销观点，就粮食论粮食，而应该从国民经济全局出发。解决中国粮食问题，持续增产是基础，搞活流通是关键，合理消费是基点。一个完整的粮食战略，不能孤立地就流通论流通，除人口、资源等相关因素外，应当包括生产、流通、消费等有机构成内容。从合理的消费结构出发，调整优化产业结构，建立适应二者的包括作为中介的粮食商业的流通结构。
    根据有关方面专家研究和论证，为使我国人民本世纪末达到小康生活水平，粮食总需求量至少为5000亿公斤。这是一个难度相当大的战略任务。但是，这又是一个必须和可能完成的战略任务。只要采取正确的政策，运用先进的科学技术，追加必要的投入，实现粮食登上新台阶的战略目标，应当说是能够实现的。
    搞好粮食流通，在于继续沿着计划经济和市场调节相结合的方向深化改革。从我国人口多、耕地少、粮食资源属约束型的基本国情出发，至少在近、中期内，粮食流通还只能实行“双轨制”，即：国家计划收购一定量粮食，城镇居民口粮坚持计划供应；国家计划收购量以外的粮食由市场调节。为保证粮食流通活而有序，应健全和完善具有组织性、开放性、竞争性特点的市场，其中还应建立少量粮食批发市场，逐步实现粮食交易行为规范化。通过稳步深化改革，最终建立起以国营粮食商业为主渠道、其他必要渠道为辅渠道的多形式的粮食流通新体制。
    粮食，乃至食物消费，在粮食战略中应占有重要地位。受国情和粮食资源的制约，我国现阶段只能采取适度消费战略，盲目提倡高消费弊多利少。一日三餐的吃饭，似乎是普通而又普通的事，但吃饭中含有丰富的文化科学知识。人们吃饭是为了获取必要的营养，保证体质强健，益寿延年，精力充沛，有效劳动。因此，需要采取切合国情的科学的食物结构，不可简单照搬西方以动物食物为主的食物结构。我国古代有“五谷为养，五畜为益，五果为助，五菜为充”的食物结构的主张。我们应该一方面发扬本国食物结构的优点，另一方面吸取西方食物结构的长处，取长补短，以建立我国节约型的、科学的食物结构。
    解决拥有十多亿人口的中国的粮食问题，是一个十分艰巨的战略任务。我国粮食的长期情势不是患多，而是患短缺。总体而言，粮食问题既不容盲目乐观，又不能悲观失望。客观考察，我们既有沉重压力，又有巨大潜力。在全国耕地面积中，有2／3的耕地还是中低产田，增产潜力很大。在增产禾本科粮食的同时，广辟食物资源，发展草食动物、水产养殖、木本粮油等，对解决我国的粮食问题有很重要的作用。
