A long-focus lens tracks a criminal gang, capturing a series of sinister scenes:

Scene 1: On the night of April 28, 1989, more than 70 people from the village of Taocun in Caimen Town, Hunsuan County, Shanxi Province, used four high-tonnage trucks to storm a construction site in Ningwu County. The security guard could only watch as the gangsters forcibly loaded 30 tons of steel onto the trucks and drove away.

Scene 2: In August 1988, cars traveling on the Jingyuan Highway between Xinkou and Jinshanpu had to take detours. Every night, six or seven thieves would use the cover of darkness to steal goods from the trucks, including 1,200 meters of white cotton cloth, 7 color televisions, 3 black-and-white televisions, and 20 pure wool blankets, totaling over 45,000 yuan in value.

Scene 3: In June 1988, 3,000 meters of military copper wire from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center to the capital was stolen, causing serious consequences. The regional public security authorities apprehended all seven members of the gang that stole the cable. These seven gang members stole military copper wire eight times in the month before the launch of a meteorological satellite.

In recent years, due to various reasons, criminal gangs have significantly increased. According to statistics, in 1988, 178 criminal gangs were uncovered in Xinzhou Region, involving 784 members, an increase of 109.4% and 152.1% respectively compared to 1987. From January to May 1989, the entire region uncovered 61 various criminal gangs and arrested 327 criminal members, with gang crimes still on the rise.

Gang crimes seriously threaten social stability. In 1988, Xinzhou Region had 976 gang-related cases, accounting for 88.9% of the total number of cases for the year. Gang crimes have the following characteristics:

Unified purpose: The members of these criminal gangs all have a common criminal intent, some seeking money, others seeking pleasure, all committing crimes together. Last year, the region uncovered 153 gangs involved in theft, robbery, fraud, and trafficking of women, accounting for 85.9% of the total number of gangs.

Members with criminal tendencies: A large proportion of gang members have criminal records. Last year, 251 out of the 784 gang members uncovered in Xinzhou Region had criminal records, accounting for 32%. These individuals had been detained, sent to labor camps, or even imprisoned multiple times. Due to lack of proper rehabilitation, they reunited and returned to crime after release. Zhang Wenbao, Yin Xinmao, and Zhen Guifen are all from Daixian County. In 1983, Zhang and Yin were sentenced for theft, and Zhen Guifen was detained for gambling. After returning to society, they formed a gang to steal safes. Starting from 1987, the three criminals roamed through 19 counties and cities in Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, stealing from 73 units, 42 safes, and stealing goods worth 150,000 yuan.

Low age of criminals: Out of the 784 gang members investigated, 713 had an education level of junior high school or below, with a large portion being illiterate. Age-wise, 82% were under 25, with 21% under 17, the youngest being only 11 years old. A significant portion were dropouts or current students. For example, six students from Xinzhou No. 2 Middle School, including Li Jingwu, formed a gang and committed 12 crimes, stealing a total value of 6,742 yuan.

Premeditated crimes: Criminal gangs are selective in their members, meticulous in their planning, and covert in their operations, with multiple methods to evade capture. Before committing a crime, they usually conduct research, scout the location, choose tools, assign roles, and have specific plans. In late April this year, Liu Xiuqian from Dongwang Village in Xinzhou City, in collusion with Zhang Baobing and Zhang Lianghe, scouted the area and found that the villagers' livestock management was lax. Thus, they stole 10 mules in just a few days, worth over 100,000 yuan.

Versatile methods: Some criminals now combine theft, robbery, rape, and murder. If they fail to steal, they resort to robbery, and if they fail to rob, they resort to murder. These criminals not only have brutal methods but also rich criminal experience.

It is suggested that relevant departments severely punish the ringleaders of criminal gangs, enhance the deterrent effect of the law, and decisively strike against criminal gangs. All units should seriously implement security measures to prevent criminals from finding opportunities, and the public should enhance their self-defense awareness and collective defense awareness.

    团伙犯罪沉思录
    长焦距镜头跟踪着犯罪团伙，摄下了一组罪孽的画面：
    镜头一：1989年4月28日夜，山西浑源县菜村镇套村村民高四喜、仝保才等70多人，动用4辆高吨位卡车，浩浩荡荡开进了宁武县一处建筑工地。工地门卫只好眼睁睁地看着30多吨钢材被这伙歹徒强行装上汽车，扬长而去。
    镜头二：1988年8月，京原公路忻口至金山铺段施工，南来北往的汽车只好绕便道而行。每到夜晚，六七名盗贼便利用夜幕掩护，盗窃汽车运载物品，先后盗窃白棉布1200多米、彩色电视机7台、黑白电视机3台、纯毛毯20多条等物，总价值达4.5万多元。
    镜头三：1988年6月，太原卫星发射中心通往首都的军用电缆铜线被盗割3000多米，造成严重后果。地区公安机关将盗割电缆线团伙的7名成员全部抓获。这7名团伙在气象卫星发射前一个月，先后8次盗割军用电缆铜线。
    近几年，由于种种原因，犯罪团伙明显增多。据统计，1988年，忻州地区就查获犯罪团伙178个，涉及成员784名，分别比1987年上升109.4％和152.1％。1989年1至5月，全地区共查获各类犯罪团伙61个，抓获犯罪成员327人，团伙犯罪仍呈上升趋势。
    团伙犯罪严重威胁社会安定。1988年忻州地区团伙作案976起，是全年发案统计数的88.9％。团伙犯罪具有以下特点：
    目的一致性。这些犯罪团伙成员都有共同的犯罪欲望，有的贪图钱财，有的追求淫乐，共同违法犯罪。去年，我地区查获盗窃、抢劫、诈骗、拐卖妇女等团伙153个，占团伙总数的85.9％。
    成员劣根性。团伙成员中有前科劣迹的占有很大比例。去年忻州地区查获的团伙成员中，有前科劣迹的251人，占32％。这些人曾多次被拘留、劳动教养乃至判刑。由于他们没有得到很好的改造，释放后又重新聚合，重新走上犯罪道路。张文保、尹信卯、甄贵文都是代县人，1983年，张、尹二人曾因盗窃分别被判刑，甄贵文因赌博曾被拘留。他们重新回到社会后，结成盗保险柜团伙。从1987年开始，3犯先后流窜于山西、河北、河南3省的19个县、市，盗窃73个单位，盗保险柜42个，共盗得价值15万元的财物。
    罪犯低龄化。所调查的784名团伙成员中，713名系初中以下文化程度，其中大部分是文盲。从年龄结构分析，25岁以下的占82％，其中17岁以下的占21％，最小的只有11岁，有相当一部分是辍学生和在校生。如忻州市二中李靖武等6个学生，结成团伙，先后作案12起，盗窃总值达6742元。
    犯罪预谋性。犯罪团伙在人员组合上有选择，作案过程有预谋，且活动方式隐蔽，逃避打击的手段多样。作案前一般都经过研究，事先踩点，选择作案工具，确定人员分工，望风的、行盗的、掩护的、运输的各司其职，有的甚至定出周密的作案计划。今年4月下旬，忻州市东王村刘秀根勾结张宝兵、张亮和，经事先踩点，发现周围农民的牲畜管理不严。于是，他们在短短的几天内，偷盗骡子10头，价值1万余元。
    手段多能性。现在一些犯罪分子偷、抢、奸、杀集于一身，有的盗不成就抢，抢不成就杀。这类犯罪分子不仅手段凶残，而且作案经验丰富。
    建议有关部门严惩犯罪团伙首要分子，增强法律威慑力，稳、准、狠地打击犯罪团伙。各单位要认真落实安全防范措施，使犯罪分子无隙可乘，同时，全民要增强自身防卫意识和群体防卫意识。
