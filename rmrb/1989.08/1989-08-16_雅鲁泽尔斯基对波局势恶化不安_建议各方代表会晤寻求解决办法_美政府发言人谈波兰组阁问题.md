Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 15th - Polish President Jaruzelski expressed concern today over the deteriorating political and economic situation in the country. He suggested that representatives of Poland's major political and social forces hold a meeting as soon as possible to seek "reasonable solutions."

Jaruzelski made the remarks after Prime Minister Kiszczak announced on August 14th that he was prepared to resign and give up the task of forming a new government.

On August 2nd, the Polish parliament accepted the collective resignation of the previous government led by Rakowski. At the same time, it approved by a majority vote the nomination of Kiszczak as the new prime minister, proposed by President Jaruzelski. However, during the vote, all the Solidarity Trade Union deputies voted against it. Solidarity leader Walesa repeatedly stated his opposition to Kiszczak becoming prime minister and proposed that Solidarity, the United Peasants Party, and the Democratic Party form a coalition government, aiming to exclude the United Workers' Party from the government.

The Central Secretariat of the Polish Democratic Party formally stated on August 15th that it welcomed Kiszczak's announcement of his intention to resign, while emphasizing that "every effort must be made to realize Walesa's proposal." The United Peasants Party expressed that it would seriously consider Walesa's proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 15th - The U.S. government stated today that "the formation of a new government in Poland is an internal matter to be decided by the Polish people." It is believed that this is a warning to the Soviet Union not to interfere in Poland's situation.

    美政府发言人谈波兰组阁问题
    新华社华沙8月15日电（记者董福生）波兰总统雅鲁泽尔斯基15日对国家政治经济形势的恶化“表示不安”。他建议波兰各主要政治和社会力量的代表尽快举行会晤，寻求“合理的解决办法”。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基是在基什查克总理14日宣布准备辞职和放弃组阁后作上述表示的。
    今年8月2日，波兰议会接受了以拉科夫斯基为首的前政府的集体辞呈，同时以多数票赞成任命由总统雅鲁泽尔斯基提名的基什查克为新政府总理。但在表决时，团结工会派议员全部投了反对票。团结工会主席瓦文萨一再表示，反对基什查克出任总理，并建议由团结工会、统一农民党和民主党联合组阁，企图把统一工人党排除在政府之外。
    波兰民主党中央书记处15日正式声明，对基什查克总理宣布准备辞职表示欢迎，同时强调“必须尽一切努力实现瓦文萨的建议”。统一农民党则表示将认真研究瓦文萨的建议。
    新华社华盛顿8月15日电  美国政府今天表示，“波兰新政府的建立是由波兰人民自己决定的内部事务。”人们认为这是警告苏联不要干预波兰局势。
