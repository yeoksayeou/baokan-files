In the realm of education, the concept of "walking with three legs" has been widely discussed. This metaphorical phrase refers to the integration of three key elements: the school, the family, and the society. Each of these components plays a crucial role in the holistic development of a student.

The school is the primary institution where formal education takes place. It provides structured learning environments, qualified teachers, and a curriculum designed to impart knowledge and skills. However, the influence of the school is often limited to the academic aspects of a student's life. To ensure comprehensive development, the involvement of the family and the society is essential.

The family is the first social unit a child encounters. Parents and guardians play a significant role in shaping a child's values, attitudes, and behaviors. They provide emotional support, instill moral values, and create a nurturing environment that fosters growth and development. The family's influence extends beyond the home, as children often mirror the behaviors and values they observe in their families.

Society, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of influences. It includes peers, community leaders, media, and cultural norms. Society provides opportunities for social interaction, exposure to diverse perspectives, and the development of civic responsibilities. It also offers resources and support systems that can enhance a student's educational experience.

The integration of these three elements—school, family, and society—is essential for the holistic development of a student. Each component complements the others, creating a supportive network that addresses the academic, emotional, and social needs of the student. This integrated approach ensures that students receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for the challenges of the future.

In conclusion, the concept of "walking with three legs" emphasizes the importance of a collaborative effort between the school, the family, and the society. By working together, these three entities can provide a comprehensive educational experience that fosters the growth and development of students, preparing them to become responsible and contributing members of society.
