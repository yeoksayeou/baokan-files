Title: Paying Attention to the Slump in Pig Production

Recently, we conducted a sample survey of pig farming in our city and found that pig production has declined this year. Among the 441 households surveyed, a total of 1,295 pigs were raised, a decrease of 25.7% compared to the same period last year; the number of pigs on hand was 845, a decrease of 35.6% compared to the same period last year; there were 54 sows, a decrease of 17.9% compared to the same period last year. The number of large-scale pig farmers has significantly decreased, with those raising 30 pigs or more dropping from 40 households last year to just 2 this year.

Currently, households are raising more large pigs and fewer small pigs, and there is a serious backlog of fattened pigs. The city has approximately 45,000 fattened pigs weighing 75 kilograms or more, an increase of 50.1% compared to the same period last year, making it difficult to timely introduce piglets for raising.

The main reasons for the decline in pig production in our city this year are:

	1.	Feed prices have soared. In April of this year, the market price of feed in our city was 38.9 yuan per 50 jin, an increase of 68.4% compared to the same period last year. The cost of raising one 90-kilogram fattened pig has increased by 126 yuan compared to the same period last year; however, the purchase price of fattened pigs has shown a downward trend.

	2.	Difficulty in obtaining piglets. This year, our city needs to purchase 112,000 piglets from other places, accounting for 21.2% of the annual piglet replenishment. Due to insufficient local piglets, the price of piglets has risen. In April of this year, the selling price per kilogram of piglets was approximately 11 yuan, an increase of 54.9% compared to the same period last year, with each piglet priced at over 100 yuan. Purchased piglets are not only expensive but also, after long-distance transportation, have weak constitutions and high mortality rates. According to the survey, the mortality rate of purchased piglets is 1.5 times higher than that of local piglets and they easily bring in pig diseases from other places.

	3.	Insufficient purchase funds. From January to April, the food company in our city purchased 4,566 fattened pigs, a decrease of 74.2% compared to the same period last year. The 30 food business outlets in the city need a loan of 700,000 yuan for normal business operations, but the bank only provided 350,000 yuan. Due to the impact of "difficulty in selling pigs," the backlog of pigs has further worsened.

### 关注生猪生产的滑坡现象

    关注生猪生产的滑坡现象
    最近，我们抽样调查了我市生猪情况，发现今年的生猪生产已出现滑坡。被调查的441个农户，共饲养生猪1295头，比去年同期下降25.7％；生猪存栏量为845头，比去年同期下降35.6％；母猪54头，比去年同期下降17.9％。养猪大户明显减少，养猪30头以上的大户由去年同期的40户减少到2户。
    现在，农户饲养的大猪多、小猪少，肥猪压栏现象严重，全市75公斤以上的肥猪约有4.5万头，比去年同期增加50.1％，造成仔猪难以及时入圈饲养。
    我市今年生猪滑坡的主要原因是：
    饲料价格猛涨。今年4月，我市市场饲料价格为每50斤38.9元，比去年同期上涨68.4％。喂养1头90公斤重的肥猪，成本比去年同期增加126元；而肥猪收购价格却出现下跌趋势。
    猪源难以为继。今年我市要从外地购进仔猪11.2万头，占全年仔猪填栏量的21.2％。由于本地猪源不足，造成仔猪价格上涨。今年4月，每公斤仔猪售价约达11元，比去年同期上涨54.9％，每头仔猪要价100多元。外购仔猪不仅价格贵，而且经过长途贩运，体质弱、死亡率高。据调查，外购仔猪的死亡率比本地仔猪要高1.5倍，还容易将外地的生猪疫病带入本地。
    收购资金不足。1月至4月，我市食品公司收购肥猪4566头，比去年同期减少74.2％。全市30个镇乡食品营业所按正常业务量需贷款70万元，但银行只贷款35万元。由于“卖猪难”的影响，生猪压栏现象进一步加重。
