Yang Zhikuo was originally the supply and sales section chief of the cement factory on Liangshan Hill in Shandong. Last year, he competed to become the factory director and won with 390 votes to 1. Many people supported him, but also worried for him. Although the cement factory is not large, the morale of the workers is not united, and whoever becomes the director has a tough job ahead. However, Yang Zhikuo has his own methods: start with the people. He set a goal: let the vast majority of the factory workers do something good, big or small.

The original director, Yu Jialin, who lost the competition, was just over 40 years old and full of vigor. Before the competition, he declared: "If I win, I will continue to carry the burden; if I lose, I will still work hard." But after actually losing, the pressure was immense. On the first day of Yang Zhikuo's tenure, he first talked to Yu Jialin: "Jialin, let's work together. You will be the first deputy director, overseeing production." However, Yu Jialin said: "I can't do it anymore, I'm leaving!" Seeing that Yu Jialin had made up his mind, Yang Zhikuo knew that forcing him would not work, so he sincerely said: "Finding a more suitable place is also good, perhaps you can play a greater role there." Yu Jialin ran away for two months, but his job transfer did not go through, and his face was even more disgraced, to the point where he did not want to go out. Yang Zhikuo learned of this and went to his house: "Jialin, don't leave. I will handle the work with the masses." He went everywhere to persuade people: competition is a mechanism for progress, and through competition, each generation surpasses the previous one. Competition inevitably has winners and losers, and one should not be overly surprised or treat the losers differently. Seeing Yang Zhikuo's broad-mindedness, Yu Jialin decided to stay and work. Yang Zhikuo appointed him as the deputy commander of the newly built oil factory, and he turned pressure into motivation, working day and night on the construction site, completing the oil factory two months ahead of schedule.

After taking office, Yang Zhikuo did not hold grudges and used people based on their abilities. A financial section chief who had once opposed him had a heavy burden after Yang Zhikuo became the director. Yang Zhikuo talked to him frankly: "The past is past, you are familiar with the work, so continue to do a good job as the section chief." The section chief in charge of raw materials was Yang Zhikuo's "iron brother," honest but lacking in ability. Yang Zhikuo let him become a worker. A temporary worker with abilities was appointed as the section chief.

Yang Zhikuo had his own theory: as a leader in an enterprise, one must especially pay attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers. He went deep into the workers' lives to understand what they were thinking and then did the work from their hearts.

There was no canteen in the factory area, and workers ate in the workshop, where it was cold in winter, hot in summer, and there was a lot of wind and sand. He decided to build a canteen in the factory area, with fireplaces in winter and electric fans in summer, making the workers' meals more comfortable and increasing their enthusiasm.

Children had a long way to go to school, and there was a bus station in between, causing parents to worry every day. Yang Zhikuo specially allocated a bus, with an aunt taking care of the children, picking them up and dropping them off, solving the workers' worries.

The underground water pipes were broken, and they had not been repaired for five years, causing workers to fetch water from far away. Yang Zhikuo sent a deputy director to lead the repair team, finding more than ten blockages, repairing what needed to be repaired and replacing what needed to be replaced, completing the work in 20 days, and delivering water to every household...

Yang Zhikuo did more than ten practical things for the workers, and the workers all felt that they could not afford to slack off. Last year, the factory's contracted profits and taxes doubled. This year, despite the increase in raw material and fuel prices and financial difficulties, their profits and taxes still doubled.

The workers praised Yang Zhikuo for his broad-mindedness, always thinking of the people in everything he did. This silent ideological and political work is exactly what the people need.

    杨志魁的胸怀
    本报记者　段心强
    杨志魁原是山东梁山坡上水泥厂供销科长。去年竞争当厂长，以390票比1票获胜。许多人在支持他干的同时，也为他捏一把汗。水泥厂虽不大，可人心不齐，谁当厂长也够喝一壶的。然而，杨志魁自有他的招法：先从人抓起。他提出一个目标：让全厂绝大多数人大小都干点好事。
    竞争中失败的原厂长俞家麟，刚40出头，血气方刚。竞争前表态说：“胜利了，继续扛大梁；失败了，拉偏套也使大劲。”可真失败后，压力也很大。杨志魁上任的第一天，首先找他谈心：“家麟，干吧，你任第一副厂长，全面抓生产。”可俞家麟却说：“不能干啦，走！”杨志魁见老俞主意打定，知道强扭的瓜不甜，便诚恳地说：“找个更适合的地方也好，也许能发挥更大的作用。”老俞一跑两个月，工作没有调成，面子上更不好看，连门也不愿出。杨志魁知道后又到他家里：“家麟，就不要走啦。群众的工作由我来做。”他到处游说：竞争是一种进步的机制，搞竞争，一代强过一代。而竞争，必然有胜有败，不能大惊小怪，更不应对失败者另眼相看。老俞见杨志魁这么宽阔的胸怀，下决心干！杨志魁任命他为新建油脂厂的副总指挥，他变压力为动力，日夜在现场指挥安装，使油脂厂提前两月建成。
    杨志魁上任后不记恩怨，唯才是用。一个管财务的科长曾整过他，杨志魁当厂长后这个科长一度思想包袱很重。杨志魁找他明说：“过去的永远过去啦，你业务熟，应继续当好科长。”管进料的科长是杨志魁的“铁哥们”，人老实，但能力差。对不起，杨志魁让他去当工人。让一个有才能的临时工当了科长。
    杨志魁有他自己的理论：在企业里当领导要特别注意调动工人的积极性。他深入到工人中了解大伙儿在想什么，然后把工作往大家心里做。
    厂区没有餐厅，吃饭在车间，冬天冷，夏天热，风沙大。他决定在厂区盖餐厅，冬有火炉，夏有电扇，工人吃得舒坦，干劲大增。
    孩子上学路远，中间又有一个汽车站，家长天天牵肠挂肚。杨志魁专批一辆汽车，由一个阿姨照顾，来回接送，解决了工人的后顾之忧。
    地下的自来水管坏了，5年没有修好，害得工人到远处提水。杨志魁派一名副厂长带领维修队，找出“肠梗阻”十多处，该修的修，该换的换，20天完工，自来水送到各家各户……
    杨志魁一连为职工做了十几件实事，职工们都觉得不好好干对不起他。去年全厂承包的利税翻了一番。今年原材料和燃料涨价，资金又困难，他们的利税仍能翻番。
    职工们称赞杨志魁胸怀宽阔，时时事事都想着群众，这无声的思想政治工作，更是群众所需要的。
