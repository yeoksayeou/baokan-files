The UN investigation team led by Major General Martin Weedsette concluded a week-long investigation in Cambodia and began conducting investigations along the Thai-Cambodian border yesterday.

Today, in the afternoon, the UN investigation team observed the village of Kong Lu in Aran County, Prachinburi Province, Thailand (where the Thai military camp is stationed). This village was chosen as a future logistics supply base for the international supervisory body that will oversee the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. It is reported that the UN investigation team had previously visited the opposite side of the village in Cambodia for an investigation last week.

Major General Martin Weedsette also spoke to reporters about the team's activities on the border over the past two days. He said that yesterday afternoon, they met with the commander-in-chief of the West Khmer National Army, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, at one of their bases in Cambodia. This morning, they met with General Sak Sutsakhan, the leader of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, primarily discussing the future of Cambodia. He said that the investigation team will continue its activities on the border tomorrow and will meet with the leader of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, Khieu Samphan.
