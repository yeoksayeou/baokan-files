**Socialist Undertakings Are Advancing**

**Rockets and Satellites Soar Through Space, Cars and Planes Traverse the Country, Old Base Rises with New Industries**

Shanghai—China's oldest industrial base is now showcasing its new charm to the world. Today, whether on land, in the sky, or in space, Shanghai has products that are at the forefront of global standards. "Sitting still and traveling eight thousand li a day, gazing far into the heavens and seeing a thousand rivers"—Shanghai's industry has a new source of pride!

If foreign friends were to take an aerial route to inspect Shanghai's burgeoning industry, they would have the opportunity to board the MD-82 large passenger aircraft jointly produced by Shanghai and the American McDonnell Douglas Company. By July of this year, the Shanghai Aviation Industry Corporation had delivered 9 large passenger aircraft to China's civil aviation, each flying an average of 8.5 hours per day. These aircraft have accumulated over 20,000 hours of flight time on domestic and international routes.

Previously, only the United States, the Soviet Union, and the European Airbus consortium could independently assemble large aircraft of global standards. During the four years of cooperation with the American side, the Shanghai base has fully absorbed and digested the most advanced aircraft assembly technology in the world today; introduced first-class aviation industry production management experience from around the world, trained and cultivated a professional technical team, and rapidly narrowed the technological gap in the production of large civilian aircraft.

If visitors have the leisure to stroll around Shanghai's streets, they will notice that many of the cars on the roads and parked by the side of the streets are "Santanas." These cars, produced at the Anting Automobile City with 1980s standards, are deeply loved by people.

Shanghai has a history of nearly 30 years of producing sedans. In the early 1960s, Shanghai produced its first sedan, named the Phoenix, which was later changed to the Shanghai brand. In 1985, Shanghai and Volkswagen of West Germany jointly established the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Company, and labor productivity has since increased by 3.5 times. Shanghai's automotive industry has become a "national industry that has leaped to international standards in one step."

Currently, at the Shanghai Volkswagen construction site, one construction project after another is being completed. Asia's top-class sedan engine manufacturing plant and five major production facilities for Santana sedans, including the body and transmission, are under construction. By the end of this year, the domestic production rate of Shanghai Santana sedans can reach 50%, striving to reach 60%.

If visitors to Shanghai do not go to the Minhang-based New China Machinery Factory, they will not have a complete impression of Shanghai's burgeoning industry. As China's aerospace industry's first window to the world, the New China Machinery Factory has received over 700 delegations totaling more than 1,000 foreign visitors over the years, including heads of state and high-level Western aerospace delegations.

More than 20 years ago, it was still a modest machine factory. Today, with the New China Machinery Factory and a batch of other assembly and design units as the backbone, the Shanghai Aerospace Base has established an aerospace industry cooperation network consisting of more than 300 units, including colleges and universities, research departments, and manufacturing plants. It can independently and completely design, develop, and produce large launch vehicles and artificial Earth satellites, forming a new aerospace industry system. Out of the 25 artificial satellites launched nationwide, Shanghai participated in the launch of 12 satellites. In particular, in the past decade, Shanghai has independently or participated in the launch of 9 satellites, with a 100% success rate, creating a rare record in the history of global aerospace.

The technological advantages of Shanghai's aerospace industry are being transformed into enormous social and economic benefits. Using these technologies, China's first 800,000x electron microscope, the first teaching robot, the first blood rheometer, the first electronic surveillance system, as well as satellite television ground receiving systems and large-scale broadcasting and television audio systems, have been manufactured. Some of these products have entered the international market. The tactical missiles of three types—ultra-low altitude, low altitude, and medium altitude—developed by the Shanghai Aerospace Base have also been successively equipped for the troops.

The rise of these three major new industries is just one aspect of Shanghai's rapid industrial development over the past 40 years since its liberation. Shanghai's more than 10,000 enterprises, especially the more than 500 large and medium-sized enterprises that are the backbone of Shanghai's industry, have undergone tremendous changes in the 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially in the past 10 years. Shanghai's fiscal revenue accounts for 1/10 of the nation's total, and the total value of exported goods accounts for 1/12 of the nation's total. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of all parts of the country, Shanghai has made due contributions to the development of China's economy and the improvement of people's living standards.

### 火箭卫星遨游太空  汽车飞机穿梭神州  老基地崛起新产业

    火箭卫星遨游太空  汽车飞机穿梭神州
    老基地崛起新产业
    上海——中国最老的工业基地，今天正在向世界展示她新的风姿。
    如今，地上跑的、天空中飞的、太空中遨游的，都有了具有世界先进水平的“上海牌”产品。“坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河”——上海工业又有了新的骄傲！
    假如，各国的友人取道空中来考察上海新兴的工业，那么，就会有机会乘坐上海与美国麦道公司合作生产的MD—82大型客机。到今年7月，上海航空工业公司已向中国民航交付9架大型客机，每架机日平均飞行8个半小时。这些飞机在国内外航线上累计飞行已超过2万小时。
    以前，世界上只有美国、苏联和欧洲空中客车联合体能独立装配具有世界水平的大型飞机。上海基地在4年与美方合作生产飞机期间，全面地吸收、消化了代表当代世界最先进的飞机装配技术；引进了世界上第一流的航空工业生产管理经验，锻炼和培养了专业技术队伍，迅速缩短了在制作大型民航机方面的技术差距。
    假如，来访者有暇到上海街头徜徉，就会发现在路上开的，在街边停的轿车中，“桑塔纳”特别多。这些从安亭汽车城生产出来具有80年代水平的轿车，深受人们的喜爱。
    上海制造轿车已有近30年历史，60年代初，上海生产出第一辆轿车，定名为凤凰牌，后来改成上海牌。1985年，上海与西德大众汽车公司合资建立的上海大众汽车有限公司，劳动生产率至今已提高了3.5倍，上海汽车工业成为“一步跳到国际水平的民族工业”。
    目前，在上海大众公司改造工地，一个又一个的建设项目正在竣工。在亚洲堪称一流的轿车发动机制造厂和桑塔纳轿车车身、变速箱等五大生产设施，正在紧张施工。到今年底，上海桑塔纳轿车的国产化率可达到50％，力争达到60％。
    假如，来沪考察不到地处闵行的新中华机器厂去看一看，那么，他对上海新兴的工业还不能获得完整的印象。新中华厂作为中国航天工业向世界开放的第一个窗口，多年来接待了700多批共计1000多位外国来访者，其中有国家元首，也有西方高级的宇航代表团。
    在20多年前，它还是一个简陋的机器厂。今天，以新中华厂等一批总装厂、总设计单位为中坚的上海航天基地，建立了包括大专院校、研究部门和生产工厂300多个单位组成的航天工业协作网，已能独立地、完整地设计、研制、生产大型运载火箭和人造地球卫星，形成了新兴的航天产业体系。在全国发射的25颗人造卫星中，上海参与了12颗卫星的发射。尤其是近十年期间，上海独立或参与发射9颗卫星，成功率达100％，创造了世界航天史上罕见的纪录。
    上海航天工业的技术优势正在转化为巨大的社会经济效益，应用这些技术制作了中国第一台80万倍电子显微镜、第一台教学机器人、第一台血液流变仪、第一套电子警戒系统，以及卫星电视地面接收系统、大型广播电视音响系统等，有些已进入国际市场。上海航天基地研制的超低空、中低空三种型号的战术导弹，也已陆续装备部队。
    上述三大新产业的崛起，仅仅是上海解放40年来工业建设迅速发展的一个侧面。上海万余家企业，尤其是作为上海工业支柱的500多家大中型企业，在建国40年中，特别在近10年中，都发生了巨大的变化。上海财政收入占全国1／10，外贸出口商品总值占全国1／12。在党的领导和全国各地的支援下，上海为我国经济发展，为人民生活水平提高，作出了应有贡献。
