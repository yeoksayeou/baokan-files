Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 16th.

Today's issue of the CCP Central Committee's theoretical journal *Seeking Truth* publishes the full text of a speech by Li Tieying, a member of the CCP Central Committee Political Bureau and State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission, at the National Conference on Higher Education Work. The speech is titled: "Higher Education Must Uphold the Socialist Direction."

The speech is approximately 6,000 words long and consists of four parts: 1. Seriously studying and understanding the great historical significance of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and resolutely implementing the spirit of the plenary session; 2. Effectively strengthening the Party's leadership over schools, strengthening ideological and political work in schools, educating students with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and upholding the socialist direction of education; 3. It is necessary to clearly and persistently carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization; 4. We must adhere to the general policy of reform and opening up, deepen educational reforms, and promote the development and prosperity of the education cause.

The article states that, on the basis of studying and implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, unifying thoughts, and uniting the whole Party, is the most important political task for the whole Party and the whole nation at present. It is the key to summing up the past, opening up the future, and doing a good job in the current work. The Party organizations in colleges and universities must take the task of organizing the dissemination and study of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session as their primary task. Through serious study and discussion, the entire Party membership and the broad masses of cadres, teachers, and students should fully recognize and understand the great historical significance of the Fourth Plenary Session, further clarify the nature and serious harmfulness of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, and more closely unite around the Party Central Committee to achieve unity of thought and political unity, and strive to do a good job in various aspects of college work.

The article points out that education, undeniably, has class characteristics. Any social system will use its ideology to educate and influence students. As a socialist country, China naturally requires education to serve socialism and to cultivate builders and successors of the socialist cause with a firm and correct political direction. Therefore, our educational work must uphold the socialist direction. Upholding the socialist direction of education means educating students with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, conducting ideological and political work on students, and cultivating them into successors of the socialist cause. This is an important principle of our educational work. Upholding the socialist direction of education means strengthening and maintaining the Party's leadership over schools, ensuring the leadership and political core role of the Party organization in educational work. Since the founding of the nation, several leadership systems have been implemented in higher education institutions. Summarizing practical experience, the Party committee-led president responsibility system is more suitable for the actual situation and work needs of Chinese higher education institutions. Currently, a few schools are trying out the president responsibility system. Those with good results can continue to explore and summarize experiences. Those with poor results should decide to change to the Party committee-led president responsibility system. In the future, the scope of the president responsibility system trial will not be expanded. Regardless of which system is implemented, the Party's leadership over schools must be strengthened. In summary, adhering to the education of students with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and adhering to the Party's leadership over schools, are the fundamental and unshakable principles for upholding the socialist direction of higher education in China.

The article states that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the country and also the lifeline of Chinese higher education. Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles in higher education institutions means using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to clearly and persistently criticize bourgeois liberalization. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought were formed and developed in the struggle against various bourgeois ideologies. If we do not struggle against various bourgeois liberalization trends and allow them to spread, we will lose this important battlefield of higher education. What socialist direction, what Party leadership, what cultivating successors of the socialist cause, will all become empty talk.

The article emphasizes that after the decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, whether the Party and government's basic policies on education will change, and whether the Party's policy towards intellectuals will change, are issues of concern to many people at home and abroad. Here, it can be clearly told to everyone that the Party and government's basic policies on developing and reforming China's education cause, and the entire set of policies respecting knowledge and talents, not only will not change, but will also be striven to do better. Higher education institutions, as well as the entire education front, will continue to implement the basic line of "taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adhering to reform and opening up," and the policy of "education must serve socialist construction, and socialist construction must rely on education." The Thirteenth Party Congress clearly pointed out that education is the foundation for a hundred-year plan, and put education in the first place in economic construction and social development. We not only need to adhere to this development strategy, but also to implement it better in practical measures. In short, all educational policies that are conducive to upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up will not change. Only by adhering to reform and opening up will the socialist education cause have hope. Of course, the reform and opening up we implement in the field of education are reform and opening up under the premise of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, and are not the "complete Westernization" advocated by those stubbornly adhering to bourgeois liberalization.

### 李铁映撰文强调  高等教育必须坚持社会主义方向

    李铁映撰文强调
    高等教育必须坚持社会主义方向
    新华社北京8月16日电　今天出版的中共中央理论刊物《求是》杂志，刊登了中共中央政治局委员、国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映在全国高等学校工作会议上的讲话全文，题为：《高等教育必须坚持社会主义方向》。
    讲话约6000多字，共四个部分：一、认真学习领会十三届四中全会召开的重大历史意义，坚定不移地贯彻执行全会的精神；二、切实加强党对学校的领导，加强学校的思想政治工作，用马列主义、毛泽东思想教育学生，坚持教育的社会主义方向；三、必须旗帜鲜明地、深入持久地开展反对资产阶级自由化的斗争；四、要坚持改革、开放的总方针，深入进行教育改革，促进教育事业的发展和繁荣。
    文章说，在学习、贯彻十三届四中全会精神的基础上统一思想，团结全党，是当前全党、全国最大的政治任务，是总结过去，开创未来，做好当前工作的关键。高校党组织必须把组织好四中全会精神的传达与学习，坚定和端正广大师生员工的政治立场，当作首要的任务。通过认真地学习、讨论，使全体党员和广大干部、师生充分认识和领会四中全会的重大历史意义，进一步认清这场动乱和反革命暴乱的性质和严重危害性，更加紧密地团结在党中央周围，实现思想上的统一和政治上的团结，努力做好高校的各项工作。
    文章指出，教育无可否认是具有阶级性的。任何一种社会制度都要以它的意识形态来教育和影响学生的。我国作为一个社会主义国家，理所当然地要求教育必须为社会主义服务，为社会主义事业培养具有坚定正确政治方向的建设者、接班人。因此，我们的教育工作必须坚持社会主义方向。坚持教育的社会主义方向，就必须用马列主义毛泽东思想教育学生，坚持对学生进行思想政治工作，把他们培养成社会主义事业的接班人，这是我国教育工作的一个重要原则。坚持教育的社会主义方向，就必须坚持和加强党对学校的领导，保证党组织在教育工作中的领导和政治核心作用。建国以来我们在高等学校中先后实行过几种领导体制。总结实践经验来看，党委领导下的校长负责制更加适合我国高等学校的实际情况和工作需要。现在有少数学校在试行校长负责制，效果好的可以继续探索，总结经验。效果不好的就应下决心改为党委领导下的校长负责制。今后一个时期，不再扩大校长负责制的试点范围。无论实行哪一种体制，都要加强党对学校的领导。总之，坚持对学生的马列主义毛泽东思想的教育和坚持党对学校的领导，这是坚持我国高等教育社会主义方向的不可动摇的根本原则。
    文章说，四项基本原则是立国之本，也是我国高等教育的生命线。在高等学校坚持四项基本原则，就必须运用马列主义和毛泽东思想，旗帜鲜明地批判资产阶级自由化思潮。马列主义毛泽东思想是在同形形色色的资产阶级思潮作斗争的过程中形成和发展的。不同资产阶级自由化思潮作斗争而任其蔓延，我们将失去高等教育这块重要阵地。什么社会主义方向，什么党的领导，什么培养社会主义事业的接班人，都将成为一纸空谈。
    文章强调，在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利以后，我国党和政府关于教育的基本方针政策会不会改变，党对知识分子的政策会不会改变，这是国内和国外很多人士所关注的问题。这里，可以明确地告诉大家，党和政府关于发展和改革我国教育事业的基本方针政策，关于尊重知识、尊重人才的一整套知识分子政策不仅不会改变，而且要努力搞得更好。高等学校以至整个教育战线将继续贯彻“以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革、开放”的基本路线，贯彻“教育必须为社会主义建设服务，社会主义建设必须依靠教育”的方针。党的十三大明确指出，百年大计，教育为本，并且把教育摆在经济建设和社会发展的首要位置。我们不仅要坚持这一发展战略，而且要在实际措施上比过去落实得更好。总之，一切有利于坚持四项基本原则，有利于改革开放的教育政策，都不会改变。只有坚持改革、开放，社会主义的教育事业才有希望。当然，我们在教育领域实行的改革、开放，是在坚持四项基本原则前提下的改革、开放，决不是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人所鼓吹的“全盘西化”。
