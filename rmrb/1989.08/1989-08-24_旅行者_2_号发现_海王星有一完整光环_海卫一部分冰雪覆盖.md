    Voyager 2 Discovers Neptune Has a Complete Ring and Triton Partially Covered with Ice and Snow
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 22

    American astronomer Smith said in Pasadena on August 22 that the space probe Voyager 2 has discovered that Neptune is surrounded by a faint, complete ring.

    On August 11, Voyager 2 discovered two incomplete rings around Neptune. However, further analysis of the photographs sent back by Voyager 2 indicates that one of them is a continuous ring. Smith said that this is Neptune's first ring, and it indeed exists and is always continuous.

    Voyager 2 has also recently discovered that Neptune's atmosphere is turbulent, with white clouds composed of frozen natural gas and a large-scale cyclone similar to Earth's, followed by a long series of storms.

    Voyager 2 has also discovered that Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, is brighter, colder, and smaller than scientists had originally imagined. The photographs sent back by Voyager 2 indicate that Triton may be partially covered by snow and frozen water, and it occasionally snows on Triton. There are many black spots near Triton's equator.

    “旅行者2”号发现
    海王星有一完整光环  海卫一部分冰雪覆盖
    新华社华盛顿8月22日电  美国天文学家史密斯22日在帕萨迪纳说，“旅行者2”号太空探测器发现海王星周围有一暗淡的完整光环。
    8月11日，“旅行者2”号发现两条不完整的海王星光环。但是，对“旅行者2”号送回的照片的进一步分析表明，其中一条是连续的光环。史密斯说，这是海王星的第一个光环，它确实存在，而且始终是连续的。
    “旅行者2”号最近还发现，海王星的大气层动荡不定，大气层里含有由冰冻的天然气构成的白云和一股像地球那样大面积的气旋，跟随在气旋后面的是一长串风暴。
    “旅行者2”号还发现，海王星的最大卫星——海卫一比科学家们原先想象的更亮、更冷和更小。“旅行者2”号发回的照片表明，海卫一可能部分地被雪和冻结的水所覆盖，海卫一上还不时地下雪。海卫一的赤道附近有许多黑斑。
