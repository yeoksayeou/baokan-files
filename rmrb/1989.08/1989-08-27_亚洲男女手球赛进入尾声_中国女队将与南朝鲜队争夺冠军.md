Despite the fact that the Asian Men's and Women's Handball Championship still has two days to go before its conclusion, the strong South Korean men's team has already secured the gold medal, successfully defending their Asian title. Today and yesterday, they consecutively defeated two other strong teams, Kuwait and Japan, with scores of 27:26 and 24:19 respectively, at the Yuetan Sports Stadium. They finished their entire competition with an undefeated record. Kuwait and Japan will compete for the silver medal in the 5th Asian Men's Handball Championship on the 29th.

Currently, both teams have won all three of their matches in the round-robin tournament. The other three women's teams have already finished their competitions. Japan, with two wins and two losses, secured the third place. Chinese Taipei, with one win and three losses, is in fourth place, and Hong Kong, with four losses, is in fifth place.

Today, the Chinese men's team competed against Saudi Arabia for the 4th to 6th places. In the first half, for the first 20 minutes, the competition between Saudi Arabia and China was intense, with neither side able to gain a clear advantage. It was not until the 25th minute that China launched a series of rapid counterattacks, widening the score to 14:8 at the end of the first half. In the second half, China played at a higher level, allowing their opponents to score only 3 points in 30 minutes. The final score was 30:17 in favor of China.

China will face Qatar in their final match on the 29th to determine the 4th and 5th places. Qatar and Saudi Arabia's match on the 26th ended in a 22:22 draw, the only draw in this tournament so far.

The rankings for the 7th to 9th places in the men's competition have been decided. Chinese Taipei is in 7th place, Iran is in 8th place, and the Hong Kong men's team, like their women's team, is in last place.
