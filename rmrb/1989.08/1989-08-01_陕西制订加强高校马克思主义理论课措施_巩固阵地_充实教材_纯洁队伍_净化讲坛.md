Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 1st.

"Blood lessons have taught us that the banner of Marxism must not fall, and the teaching position of Marxist theory must be firmly defended!" Over 50 Marxist theory teaching and research room directors from various universities in Shaanxi recently issued this call in Xi'an. The provincial education department decided to take measures to strengthen the teaching of Marxist theory in higher education institutions.

Shaanxi Province has 49 higher education institutions with nearly a thousand Marxist theory teachers. In recent years, most teachers have persisted in Marxist theory teaching under very difficult and complex conditions, making arduous efforts. However, due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization, in some universities, the Marxist theory teacher team is weak, the position has been lost, and the lecture platform has been polluted.

Learning from these lessons, the Shaanxi Provincial Education Department decided that before the start of the new semester, each school should organize Marxist theory teachers to attend study or discussion classes, clear their minds, train cadres, and use the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee to distinguish right from wrong and unify thoughts. After the start of the new semester, time should be concentrated on conducting Marxist political education and legal education for students, helping students understand the causes, nature, and correctness of the government's decision-making during the turmoil, and striving to ensure that the vast majority of students have a basically correct political attitude. At the same time, Marxist philosophy teaching should be strengthened to analyze and criticize bourgeois liberalization views using Marxist basic principles and to arm a wide range of students with Marxist historical materialism.

The Shaanxi Provincial Education Department has made arrangements for Marxist theory research and textbook compilation. Based on the hotspots in students' thoughts and the difficult points in teaching during this political turmoil, a list of must-read Marxist books has been determined. Teachers will be organized to divide tasks and write a series of thematic papers and textbooks on Marxist principles, the history of the Chinese Revolution, and the construction of Chinese socialism.

In response to the problems existing in the teaching team of Marxist theory courses in universities, the Shaanxi Provincial Education Department proposed to purify the team and clean up the lecture platform. Teachers who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization views should be resolutely adjusted. Education and training should be strengthened for the majority of theoretical course teachers. The provincial education department also decided to allocate 100,000 yuan in special funds for the construction of Marxist theory course teaching.

    陕西制订加强高校马克思主义理论课措施
    巩固阵地  充实教材  纯洁队伍  净化讲坛
    本报西安8月1日电　记者孟西安报道：“血的教训告诫我们，马克思主义的旗帜不能倒，马克思主义理论教学阵地必须坚守！”来自陕西各高校的50多名马克思主义理论教研室主任，日前在西安发出这一呼声。省高教局决定采取措施，加强高等院校马克思主义理论课教学。
    陕西省49所高等院校共有马克思主义理论课教师近千名。近年来，大多数教师在十分困难、复杂的情况下，坚持马克思主义的理论教学，作出了艰苦的努力。但是，由于资产阶级自由化思潮影响，在有的高校中，马克思主义理论教师队伍力量单薄，阵地丢失，讲坛被污染。
    吸取这一教训，陕西省高教局决定，开学前，各校集中时间举办马克思主义理论课教师学习班或研讨班，清理思想，培训骨干，用十三届四中全会精神分清是非，统一思想。开学后，集中时间对学生进行马克思主义的政治教育和法制教育，帮助学生认识动乱的原因、性质和政府采取决策的正确性，争取绝大多数学生有一个基本正确的政治态度。同时，要加强马克思主义哲学教学，用马克思主义的基本原理分析、批判资产阶级自由化观点，用马克思主义唯物史观武装广大学生。
    陕西省高教局对马克思主义理论研究和教材编写作了部署。根据这次政治动乱中学生思想上的热点和教学中的难点问题，确定一批马克思主义的必读书目，组织教师分工落实，就马克思主义原理、中国革命史、中国社会主义建设等方面写出一批专题论文和教材。
    针对高校马克思主义理论课教学队伍存在的问题，陕西省高教局提出纯洁队伍，净化讲坛。对于顽固坚持资产阶级自由化观点的教师，要坚决调整。对广大理论课教师要加强教育与培训。省高教局还决定拨出10万元专款，用于马克思主义理论课教学的建设。
