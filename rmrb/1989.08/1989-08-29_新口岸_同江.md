Tongjiang City is located across the river from the Soviet city of Khabarovsk. In 1986, with the approval of the State Council, the Tongjiang Port, which had been closed for more than 20 years, was officially reopened for trade with the Soviet Union.

This year, the trade volume between Tongjiang City and the Soviet Union has reached over 80 million Swiss francs in the first half of the year. Including labor exports and forestry operations, the total trade volume has reached over 200 million Swiss francs. In the first half of this year, more than 500 domestic and foreign delegations have come to discuss trade, and 16 economic and technological cooperation projects have been successfully negotiated.
