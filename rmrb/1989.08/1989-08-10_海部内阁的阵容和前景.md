People's Daily, Tokyo, August 10th

On August 9th, Kaifu Junichiro was elected as the Prime Minister of Japan and simultaneously formed a new cabinet. In Japan, where the economy is continuously growing and the people's lives are stable, the political situation is turbulent, with the cabinet changing twice in just a few months. This cannot help but draw the attention of the international community.

The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has traditionally selected its president and prime minister based on "seniority." This means prioritizing faction leaders and members of parliament who have been elected and served in the cabinet more frequently. Exceptions are rare and usually occur as temporary measures during extraordinary times. Kaifu belongs to the small and weak Kawamoto faction within the LDP and has never held a leadership role within the party or an important position in the cabinet. His ability to be elected smoothly is entirely due to the support of the Kono, Abe, and Nakasone factions. The major factions supporting a smaller faction is primarily motivated by the desire to maintain influence over the political situation. The powerful Kono faction is the main force behind the scenes, so the opposition parties refer to the Kaifu cabinet as the "Bamboo Shadow Cabinet" or the "Third Kono Cabinet."

Kaifu's cabinet formation naturally did not forget the favor he received, maintaining the balance of factional interests. The number of cabinet members from the major factions is almost unchanged from the previous cabinet; the Kawamoto faction, to which Kaifu belongs, increased by one member; the Miyazawa and Niijima factions each decreased by one member, possibly due to their dissenting views during the presidential election. This can be seen as a clear reward and punishment.

Within the framework of maintaining the basic structure of factional composition, Kaifu also sought innovation. The inclusion of two women in the cabinet is a first. The appointment of economic commentator Takahara Sumiko, a journalist by background, is unprecedented for a civilian woman to enter the cabinet. Excluding the Prime Minister, 13 out of the 20 ministers are first-time cabinet members, a result of Kaifu's intention to present a fresh face.

After forming the cabinet, Kaifu referred to the new cabinet as the "Dialogue and Reform Cabinet." Kaifu, known for his eloquence since his university days when he won the national college debate championship, has a well-established reputation. The new cabinet includes individuals with backgrounds in journalism, radio broadcasting, economic commentary, and political activism, providing ample talent for dialogue. Learning from the LDP's consecutive election failures, the power of female voters cannot be ignored. Appointing women as ministers can strengthen dialogue with female voters and counter the "women's whirlwind" led by the Socialist Party leader Doi Takako. This is a preliminary arrangement for future policy debates and election speeches with the opposition parties.

Looking ahead to the prospects of the Kaifu cabinet, the outlook is not optimistic. Similar to when Uno took office, the media has already started speculating on the lifespan of the new cabinet, referring to it as a "caretaker cabinet for elections." The implication is that if the Kaifu cabinet avoids major mistakes, it can be re-elected by the end of October, and the fate of the cabinet will depend on the outcome of the LDP in the general election following the dissolution of the House of Representatives. If they fail again, the day of the election will be the end of the cabinet's term. Dissolving the House of Representatives and announcing an election is a cabinet prerogative, and the Kaifu cabinet will certainly seize the opportunity to exercise this power at a time favorable to the LDP. The prerequisite for a favorable time is that the Kaifu cabinet achieves something.

The success of the Kaifu cabinet in addressing major issues will determine its effectiveness. Compared to foreign policy, domestic policy is more directly related to the fate of the government, and foreign policy is far less connected to votes. Among domestic issues, the urgent ones are the "three major issues" that led to the LDP's election failures: political reform, consumption tax, and agricultural problems. When Uno was in power, he referred to his cabinet as the "Progressive Reform Cabinet," but he made little progress on political reform. People hope that the Kaifu cabinet will do something concrete to eliminate the evils of the money-politics system, rather than repeating past mistakes. Regarding the widely criticized consumption tax, Kaifu has promised to make amendments. The opposition parties have already indicated that they will propose a bill to abolish the consumption tax, which will be the first test for the Kaifu cabinet. Whether they can present a satisfactory amendment plan in the second half of the fiscal year starting in October will be a test of the Kaifu cabinet's ability to handle domestic issues. The agricultural problem is also tricky; opening the agricultural market to foreign countries faces opposition from farmers, while adopting protectionism will be condemned by international opinion, making it a difficult equation to solve. With numerous issues to address and answers required before the dissolution of the House of Representatives, the Kaifu cabinet feels significant pressure.

Kaifu admires the former Prime Minister Miki Takeo the most in the political arena. Miki often quoted Confucius, saying, "A person without trustworthiness is unworthy of being known." Kaifu also frequently mentions this. The LDP faces its greatest crisis since its establishment, and the root cause is the loss of political trust among the people. Kaifu is aware that only by solving the current issues can the people "know his worth," and only then can the new cabinet survive.

### 海部内阁的阵容和前景

    海部内阁的阵容和前景
    本报记者　于青
    8月9日，海部俊树当选日本首相，同日组成新内阁。在经济持续增长，百姓生活安定的日本，政局风雨飘摇，数月之内内阁两次更迭，不能不引起国际社会的注意。
    自民党推选总裁和首相，向来根据“资历序列”。即优先考虑派阀首领和议员当选、入阁次数较多的人。偶有例外，多是非常时期的权宜之计。海部在自民党内属于人少势单的河本派，又未曾担任过党内领导角色和内阁重要职位。之所以能顺利当选，全靠党内竹下、安倍和中曾根三派合力支持。主要派阀支持弱小派阀，概出自易于保持对政局影响力的动机。人多势众的竹下派是幕后纵横捭阖的主要力量，因此在野党称海部内阁是“竹影政权”、“第三次竹下内阁”。
    海部组阁自然不会忘记承蒙关照之恩，内阁人事依然维持派系平衡的格局。主要派阀入阁人数与前内阁几乎没有变化；海部所在河本派增加1人；宫泽派和二阶堂派各减少1人，许是念及这两派在选举总裁时持有异议。可谓赏罚分明。
    在维持派系构成基本格局的范围内，海部也力求新意。两名女性同时进入内阁，算是创举。启用记者出身的经济评论家高原须美子，女性民间人士入阁是首开先例。除总理大臣外，内阁中20名大臣有13人是第一次入阁，也是海部着意面目一新的结果。
    海部组阁之后，把新内阁称为“对话和改革内阁”。海部大学时代曾获全国大专学校辩论比赛第一名，其能言善辩早有定评。新内阁中不乏报社记者、电台播音员、经济评论家和政界鼓动家出身的人物，为对话做了充分的人才准备。吸取自民党在选举中接连失败的教训，女性选民的力量不可忽视。启用女性担任大臣，可以加强与女性选民的对话，加强与社会党委员长土井多贺子刮起的“女性旋风”抗衡。为日后与在野党展开政策论争和竞选演说事先布阵。
    展望海部内阁前景，不容乐观。与宇野上台时相同，海部内阁诞生伊始，舆论界已开始推算新内阁的寿命，认为这是一届“管理选举的内阁”。其含意是，海部内阁如无闪失，任期到10月底时可连选再任，内阁命运取决于自民党在解散众院大选中胜负如何。如果再次失败，选举之日就是内阁寿终之时。解散众院、宣布大选是内阁职权，海部内阁当然会审时度势，选择有利于自民党的时机行使这一职权。有利时机出现的前提是海部内阁有所作为。
    海部内阁能否有所作为在于对面临的主要课题能否做出令人满意的答案。内政和外交相比较，前者更直接关系到政权命运，外交远不如内政与选票关系密切。内政课题中急待解决的无非是导致自民党在选举中失败的那“三大件”，即政治改革、消费税和农业问题。宇野执政当初，把自己的内阁称为“改革前进内阁”，然而在政治改革上没有取得什么进展。人们期待海部内阁为消除金权体制的弊端能做些实事，而不是重蹈覆辙。对于怨声载道的消费税，海部许诺进行修改。在野党已表示将提出废除消费税法案，这是海部内阁面临的第一次较量。在10月份开始的下半期会计年度能否拿出消费者满意的修改方案，是考验海部内阁处理内政问题能力的试金石。农业问题也很棘手，向国外开放农产品市场遭到农民反对，采取保护主义将受国际舆论谴责，这是一道难解的方程式。众多课题又是限期在解散众院之前做出答案，海部内阁深感压力不小。
    海部在政界最崇拜前首相三木武夫。三木生前经常提示的子曰“人而无信，不知其可也。”海部也不时挂在嘴边。自民党面临结党以来最大危机，原因在于政治失信于民。海部自知，只有解决面临课题，才能使民“知其可也”，才能延续新内阁生存。（本报东京8月10日电）
