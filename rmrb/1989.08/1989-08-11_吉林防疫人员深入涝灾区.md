Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 11th.

Nearly a thousand health and epidemic prevention personnel from Jilin Province have entered the front lines of the disaster-stricken areas to provide medical services to the people. Currently, the province has effectively controlled the spread of infectious diseases in the disaster areas, and so far, no village has reported any outbreaks.

In mid-July, Jilin Province experienced a major flood disaster, affecting 1.15 million people. The provincial government and the provincial health department allocated 80,000 yuan in special funds to purchase disinfection drugs for disaster relief.

Leaders from the provincial health department braved the heavy rain to rush to the disaster areas, where they arranged and implemented disease prevention measures. They also issued a regulation that all sick disaster victims would be treated immediately and free of charge.
