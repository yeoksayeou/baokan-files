    诸路世界足坛名将莫斯科献技
    新华社莫斯科8月12日电　（记者张志强）10日，不同时期的世界足坛名将汇聚莫斯科，以精湛的球艺庆祝苏联足坛宿将亚申的60寿辰。
    亚申是五六十年代驰骋世界足坛的著名守门员。他所在的莫斯科狄纳莫队5次夺得苏联全国冠军，他还代表国家队夺取了1956年的奥运会冠军。亚申不仅技艺精湛，而且有良好的体育道德。球王贝利认为他是现代足球史上最出色的守门员。
    这次庆祝比赛是在莫斯科狄纳莫体育场进行的。比赛分两场，第一场是由苏联莫斯科、基辅、明斯克、第比利斯的4支狄纳莫足球队老队员组成的元老队对世界元老队。在这场比赛中，联邦德国的贝肯鲍尔、英格兰的查尔顿和葡萄牙的埃塞比奥等“誉满全球”的名宿披挂上阵，使未有机会目睹他们当年风姿的年轻一代球迷大饱眼福。
    第二场比赛是由上述4支球队的现役队员对世界明星队。世界明星队上场的有巴西的小阿尔贝托、联邦德国的鲁梅尼格和布里格尔等人。
