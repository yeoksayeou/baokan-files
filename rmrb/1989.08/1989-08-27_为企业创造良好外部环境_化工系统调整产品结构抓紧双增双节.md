The Minister of the Chemical Industry, Gù Xiùlián, recently urged the chemical industry to continue focusing on rectification and restructuring, combining product structure adjustments with the "double increase and double savings" campaign.

This year, the state plans to produce 85 million tons of fertilizers and 200,000 tons of pesticides. These production targets have been broken down and assigned to various regions and production enterprises, but there are still many difficulties in completing this plan. The Ministry of the Chemical Industry proposes to further strengthen scheduling and coordination, take various effective measures, and help enterprises solve problems related to energy, raw materials, and transportation, creating a relatively good external environment for production.

Currently, the structural contradictions in chemical products are prominent, and the sales of some chemical products have shifted from smooth to stagnant. This is an opportunity for the chemical industry to adjust its product structure. The Ministry of the Chemical Industry proposes to focus on developing and supporting agricultural chemical products, basic chemical raw materials for light textiles, electronics, and machinery, organic chemical raw materials, synthetic materials, fine chemical products that meet market demand, as well as urgently needed rubber and plastic processing products. Production and development of small paints, dyes, and rubbers should be restricted, and a number of township enterprises that pollute the environment, waste resources, and produce shoddy products should be rectified, adjusted, and shut down. At the same time, exports should be significantly increased to enhance foreign exchange earnings.

The chemical industry is a major energy consumer with great potential. Another way to improve economic efficiency is through the "double increase and double savings" campaign. The Ministry of the Chemical Industry requires that, while strengthening management and plugging loopholes, key loss-making enterprises, loss-making industries, and loss-making products should be targeted. The goal of reducing losses should be effectively implemented in enterprises.

    为企业创造良好外部环境
    化工系统调整产品结构抓紧双增双节
    本报北京8月27日讯　化工部部长顾秀莲日前要求化工系统继续抓好治理整顿，把调整产品结构和大力开展“双增双节”运动结合起来。
    今年，国家计划生产化肥8500万吨、农药20万吨，生产指标已逐级落实到各地、各生产企业，但完成这个计划困难还很多。化工部提出，要进一步加强调度、协调工作，采取多种有效措施，帮助企业解决能源、原材料和交通运输等困难，为企业生产创造一个较好的外部环境。
    当前，化工产品结构性矛盾突出，部分化工产品销售由畅转滞。这是化工部门调整产品结构的机会。化工部提出，重点发展和支持农业化工产品，为轻纺、电子、机电产品服务的基本化工原料、有机化工原料、合成材料，适销对路的精细化工产品，以及市场急需的橡胶、塑料加工制品。限制小油漆、小染料、小橡胶的生产和发展，整顿、调整、关掉一批污染环境、浪费资源、产品粗制滥造的乡镇企业。在此同时，大力增加出口，提高创汇能力。
    化工行业是耗能大户，潜力很大，提高经济效益的另一手是“双增双节”。化工部要求在加强管理、堵塞漏洞的同时，针对重点亏损企业、亏损行业和亏损产品，切实抓好扭亏增盈工作，把减亏的目标落实到企业。　　　（曲华真）
