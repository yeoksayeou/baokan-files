Ren Zhonglin, Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, reported to the ninth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress today that by the end of last year, there were 294,946 various types of companies nationwide (including 477,431 branch institutions). There were 40.88 million people employed in these companies. Nationwide, 47,956 cadres from county-level and above party and government organs were concurrently holding positions in companies (enterprises). Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a thorough cleanup and rectification of various types of companies.

Ren Zhonglin said that among the cadres concurrently holding positions in companies (enterprises), there were 37,380 in-service cadres and 10,576 retired cadres. Among them, there were 246 cadres at the provincial and ministerial level, 2,324 at the municipal and bureau level, and 8,193 at the county and section level.

Ren Zhonglin said that among the various types of companies nationwide, 43% were state-owned, 53% were collectively owned, and 4% were joint ventures and other types. By industry, 25.3% were production and technological development companies, 63.6% were in the commercial, material supply, and circulation sectors, and 11.1% were in other industries. By time, 114,900 companies were established in the second half of 1986, accounting for 39% of the total.

He said that the reason for the rapid increase in companies is that many places and departments, in the context of economic overheating and the pursuit of profits, saw that making money was easy in the circulation sector, and established too many companies, deviating from the actual needs of the development of the commodity economy. Many agencies and units did not firmly implement the central government's decision to prohibit party and government organs from engaging in business and enterprise operations, and instead established companies to streamline administrative organs, place cadres, solve funding issues, or blindly advocate for "income generation." Additionally, the relevant laws, regulations, and systems for companies were not perfect, there was multi-headed approval, loose controls, and poor supervision and management, leading to the chaotic development of companies.

Ren Zhonglin pointed out that this round of "company fever" has four characteristics: First, there are many party and government organs engaging in business and establishing companies, and many party and government cadres (including retired cadres) holding concurrent positions in companies. In 1985, during the cleanup and rectification of companies, 27,000 enterprises run by party and government organs were either dissolved or decoupled, but by the end of October 1988, various levels of party and government organs, mass organizations, and social groups had established 23,913 companies. Second, there are many companies in the circulation sector and those engaged in the trading of important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods. Nationwide, there are 187,500 companies in the commercial, material supply, and circulation sectors, accounting for 63% of the total number of companies. Among the more than 110,000 companies established in the second half of 1986, most are in the circulation sector, and other types of companies also mostly engage in commodity purchasing and selling. Third, there is a lot of business overlap. For example, among the 26 travel agencies or tourism companies registered with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, apart from the three major travel agencies under the National Tourism Administration, the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, many state organs, mass organizations, and companies have also established their own travel agencies or tourism companies. Fourth, there are many companies engaging in illegal and law-breaking operations. According to incomplete statistics, 23,367 companies have discrepancies between their registered capital and actual capital, and 35,575 companies are engaged in illegal and law-breaking operations.

He said that from the situation in various places, some companies have various problems, and some problems are quite serious, mainly manifested in the following: (1) Some party and government organs and cadres, including retired cadres, use the power of the organs and the relationships of the cadres to engage in business and enterprise operations, engage in illegal business activities, and illegally seek excessive profits. (2) Some companies do not separate politics from business, having both administrative power and engaging in business activities. Some of these companies use administrative powers such as project approval, material allocation, and fund distribution to engage in business, some sell important production materials at a markup, and some collect improper fees, seeking profits for their units or small groups. (3) Some companies use various means to engage in illegal operations, some sell important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods, some speculate in foreign exchange, and even sell import and export commodity permits, seeking excessive profits. Some companies engage in fictitious trading, use fake economic contracts to commit fraud, and some engage in counterfeit and shoddy goods, seriously harming the interests of consumers. (4) Many companies violate financial management systems, some embezzle profits, some evade taxes, some companies, detached from China's national conditions, set high wages, issue bonuses and subsidies arbitrarily, some entertain and give gifts, waste money, and some people use their authority to embezzle, delay payment of public funds, and even engage in corruption, bribery, extortion, and acceptance of bribes.

Ren Zhonglin said that from the above problems, it can be seen that in recent years, the chaotic development of companies has disrupted the economic order, exacerbated social inequity, interfered with clean governance, and affected social stability. To promote the healthy development of socialist planned commodity economy, ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and socialist modernization, it is necessary to conduct a thorough cleanup and rectification of various types of companies. Cleaning up and rectifying companies is not to stop establishing companies, nor is it to deny the positive role of companies in economic life, but to solve the problems in the operation and development of companies, change the current chaotic situation, and better implement the policy of reform and opening up, activate the economy, and develop the economy.

    任中林向人大常委会九次会议汇报
    全国各类公司逾29万个
    公司发展过多过滥　必须认真清理整顿
    新华社北京8月29日电　国家工商行政管理局局长任中林今天在七届全国人大常委会第九次会议上说，截至去年底，全国共有各类公司294946户（如果包括分支机构为477431户），从业人员4088万多人。全国县以上党政机关共有47956名干部在公司（企业）兼任职。因此，必须对各类公司进行认真的清理整顿。
    任中林说，在这些在公司（企业）兼任职的干部中，在职干部37380名，离退休干部10576名，其中，省部级干部246名，地厅局级干部2324名，县处级干部8193名。
    任中林说，全国各类公司中，按所有制形式分，全民所有制的公司占43％；集体所有制的公司占53％；联营和其它类型的公司占4％。按行业分，生产和科技开发型公司占25.3％；商业、物资供销等流通领域的公司占63.6％；其他行业的公司占11.1％。按时间分，1986年下半年以后成立的公司有114900户，占总数的39％。
    他说，公司增加得这样快的原因是，许多地方和部门在经济过热和片面追求利润的情况下，看到在流通领域赚钱容易，脱离商品经济发展的实际需要成立了过多的公司；许多机关和单位贯彻中央禁止党政机关经商办企业的决定不坚决，为精简行政机构、安置干部、解决经费或盲目提倡“创收”而开办公司；再加上有关公司的法律、法规和制度不健全，多头审批，把关不严，监督管理工作跟不上，导致了公司的发展过多过滥。
    任中林指出，这次的“公司热”有四个特点：一是党政机关经商办公司和党政机关干部（包括离退休干部）在公司兼职任职的多。1985年清理整顿公司时，全国党政机关办的27000户企业已经撤销或脱钩，但到1988年10月底，各级党政机关、群众组织和社会团体又办起了23913户公司。二是流通领域和经营重要生产资料及紧俏耐用消费品的公司多。全国商业、物资供销等流通领域的公司有187500户，占公司总数的63％。在1986年下半年以后成立的11万多户公司中，多数是流通领域的公司，其他类型的公司也大多兼营商品购销业务。三是业务重叠的多。如已在国家工商行政管理局登记的26家旅行社或旅游公司中，除国家旅游局、国务院侨办、团中央所属的国旅、中旅、青旅三大旅行社外，许多国家机关、群众组织和公司，也设立自己的旅行社或旅游公司。四是违章违法经营的多。据不完全统计，注册资金与实有资金不符的公司有23367户，违法违章经营的公司有35575户。
    他说，从各地情况看，一部分公司存在这样那样的问题，有些问题相当严重，主要表现在：（一）一些党政机关和党政干部，包括离退休干部利用机关的权力和干部的关系经商办企业，从事违法经营活动，非法牟取暴利。（二）有些公司政企不分，既有行政权，又从事经营活动。其中一些公司利用立项审批、物资调拨、资金分配等行政权力经商，有的加价倒卖重要生产资料，有的收取不正当的费用，为本单位或小团体牟利。（三）一些公司采取各种手段违法经营，有的倒卖重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品，有的炒买炒卖外汇，甚至倒卖进出口商品许可证，牟取暴利。还有的公司买空卖空，利用假经济合同进行诈骗，有的经营假冒伪劣商品，严重损害消费者的利益。（四）不少公司违反财务管理制度，有的截留利润，有的偷税漏税，一些公司脱离我国国情自定高工资，乱发奖金、补贴，有的请客送礼、挥霍浪费，还有一些人利用职权，挪用、拖欠公款，甚至贪污、行贿、索贿、受贿。
    任中林说，从上述问题可以看出，近几年来公司的发展过多过滥，扰乱了经济秩序，加剧了社会分配不公，干扰了为政清廉，影响了社会安定。为了促进社会主义有计划商品经济的健康发展，保证改革开放事业和社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行，必须对各类公司进行认真的清理整顿。清理整顿公司，不是不要办公司，也不是否定公司在经济生活中的积极作用，而是为了解决公司经营和发展中存在的问题，改变目前的混乱状况，以利于更好地贯彻改革开放的方针，搞活经济，发展经济。
