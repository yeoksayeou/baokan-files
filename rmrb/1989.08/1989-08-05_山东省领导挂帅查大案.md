The provincial Party committees and governments of Shandong have made combating corruption and investigating cases of disciplinary and legal violations a major priority. They have concentrated their efforts on investigating cases within Party and government agencies involving the misuse of power for personal gain, bribery, embezzlement, illegal transactions, and illegal construction of private homes. Special attention has been given to investigating serious cases of lawlessness and indiscipline among Party and government leaders. To ensure the smooth progress of these investigations, the provincial Party secretary, governor, deputy governors, secretary of the provincial disciplinary commission, and the heads of the provincial court and procuratorate have each taken charge of 16 major cases, aiming to resolve and punish them before National Day.

From January to June this year, the provincial disciplinary inspection system investigated 5,200 cases of Party members violating discipline, resulting in the punishment of 4,920 Party members. Various levels of procuratorates investigated 1,900 cases of economic crimes. Various levels of supervisory bodies investigated 2,300 cases of administrative violations, with 437 individuals receiving administrative penalties. The provincial industrial and commercial administration investigated 13,000 cases of various types, imposing fines and confiscations totaling 16 million yuan, including 323 cases involving amounts over 100,000 yuan.
