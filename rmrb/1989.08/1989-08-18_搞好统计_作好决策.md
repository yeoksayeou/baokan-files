In the course of building a modernized country, it is essential to have a clear understanding of our national conditions and strengths, social trends, and public sentiment. We must analyze the interactions among various internal factors thoroughly to make strategic decisions that can guide the national economy and social development. Statistics play a crucial role in this process.

Statistics, encompassing statistical surveys, analysis, data provision, and supervision, are fundamental to modern management science. They serve functions such as information feedback, consultation provision, supervision implementation, and decision support. In recent years, as reform and opening up have deepened, as people's scientific and technological knowledge has increased, and as practical experience and painful lessons have accumulated, the importance of statistical work has become increasingly recognized. However, how can we improve statistical work? What principles should statistical work adhere to?

The principle of seeking truth from facts. A report or a form that truthfully reflects the actual situation can provide a reliable basis for decision-making. Seeking truth from facts requires statistics to be genuine, with one being one and two being two, without substituting falsehood for truth or fiction for reality. It also requires precision, with meticulous quantitative analysis and attention to the smallest details.

The principle of unity. Statistical data should be collected and organized according to unified regulations regarding the scope, indicators, calculation methods, and timeframes. It is not permissible to set individual standards or act independently.

The principle of independence. Since statistical work has a supervisory function, it must maintain relative independence and not be subject to interference from various parties.

Currently, the main issues with statistical figures stem from administrative intervention and leadership directives. Some leaders, for personal gain, embellish the materials they submit, engaging in practices such as false reporting, concealment, forgery, and alteration. We must firmly oppose such illegal and disorderly behaviors in statistics. Statistical personnel must be loyal to their duties. Those who suppress or instruct statistical personnel to engage in deception must be held accountable.

Of course, to improve statistics, there is also the issue of scientific methods, such as how to conduct surveys, how to collect dynamic and static data, quantitative analysis and qualitative research, and how to combine macro and micro research. Local authorities should train statistical cadres and disseminate statistical knowledge and modern social survey techniques to more people.

### 搞好统计　作好决策

    搞好统计　作好决策
    在四化建设中，要对我们的国情国力、社会动向、民意心态了解得一清二楚，对社会内部多种因素相互作用的关系分析得头头是道，能够作出“运筹帷幄之中，决胜千里之外”的英明决策、决定，正确指导国民经济和社会发展，统计工作其中起着关键作用。
    统计，包括统计调查、统计分析、统计资料的提供、统计监督，是现代管理科学的一项基本内容，它具有信息反馈、提供咨询、实施监督、支持决策的功能。近些年来，随着改革开放的深入，随着人们科学技术知识的日益增长，随着实际工作中的丰富经验和惨痛教训的积累，人们已越来越认识到统计工作的重要性。但是如何搞好统计工作呢？统计工作应该遵循什么样的原则呢？
    实事求是的原则。一张报表、一份报告，实事求是地反映事物的本来面目，才能为决策提供可靠的依据。实事求是，首先要求统计要真实，一是一，二是二，不能以假充真，以虚为实；其次要准确，做好量的分析，毫厘必计，一丝不苟。
    统一的原则。统计的数据，要按统一规定的统计范围、指标口径、计算方法、时间来搜集整理，不得自立标准，各行其是。
    独立性的原则。由于统计工作具有监督的职能，所以必须保持工作的相对独立性，不受来自各方面的干扰。
    现在，统计数字中出现不实问题，主要来自行政干预、领导意志。有些领导人为了自己的私利，在上报的材料中大作文章，什么虚报、瞒报，什么伪造、涂改等，不一而足。我们要对有这种毛病的同志大喝一声：创政绩靠实干，谋利益靠贡献。靠吹牛、蒙骗过日子，是违法犯罪行为。为了使我们的决策立于不败之地，工作中减少或避免失误，必须同那些统计中违法乱纪行为进行坚决斗争。统计人员要忠于职守。对于打击统计人员或授意强迫统计人员弄虚作假的，要追究领导人的责任。
    当然，要搞好统计，还有一个科学方法问题，如，怎样进行调查，怎样在调查中把整体性与层次性、动态资料与静态资料收集、量的解析与质的研究、宏观研究与微观研究等结合起来。各地方应培训统计干部，向更多的群众传授统计知识和现代社会调查知识。
