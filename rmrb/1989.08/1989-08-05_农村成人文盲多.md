	The rural economic and social investigation team of Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County conducted a survey on the labor force quality in Hongwei, Macamp, and Baojia villages. The survey found that currently, more than half of the rural labor force are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Strengthening rural literacy campaigns is an important task that cannot be overlooked.

	Hongwei, Macamp, and Baojia villages have a total of 2,712 laborers, including 1,401 male laborers and 1,311 female laborers. Among them, 178 people have a high school education, accounting for 6.6% of the total labor force. 294 people have a junior high school education, accounting for 10.84%. 877 people have an elementary school education, accounting for 32.3%. 1,363 people are illiterate or semi-illiterate, accounting for 50.26%.

	The aforementioned three villages are located in a relatively developed area of Minhe County in terms of culture and education, and their labor force quality is relatively good. The labor force quality in other areas is even worse.

	This cultural situation not only affects economic development but also hinders the deepening of rural reforms. This issue deserves high attention.

    农村成人文盲多
    民和回族土族自治县城乡社会经济调查队对红卫、马营和鲍家三个村劳动力素质情况进行了调查，发现当前农村劳动力中，文盲和半文盲竟占一半以上，加强农村扫盲工作是不容忽视的一件大事。
    红卫、马营和鲍家三个行政村共有劳动力2712人，其中男劳力1401人，女劳力1311人。具有高中文化程度的178人，占劳动力总数的6.6％，初中文化程度的294人，占10.84％，小学文化程度的877人，占32.3％，文盲与半文盲1363人，占50.26％。
    上述三村地处民和县文化教育比较发达地区，劳动力素质相对来说是较好的，其它地区的劳动力素质情况就更差了。
    这种文化状况不仅影响了经济的发展，也影响着农村改革的深化。这一问题应引起高度重视。
