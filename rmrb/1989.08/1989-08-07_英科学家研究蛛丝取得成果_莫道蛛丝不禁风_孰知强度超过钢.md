British scientists have made significant progress in the study of spider silk, as reported in the latest issue of the British journal "Nature."

Spider silk is an ideal high-tech material: it has excellent elasticity, strong impact resistance, and a tensile strength five times greater than steel wire.

A spider web is woven from two types of silk:
The radial silk, which forms the spokes of the web, is a single strand with a diameter of 1 micron (1 millimeter equals 1,000 microns, and a human hair is approximately 60 microns in diameter). The radial silk serves as the web's framework, transmitting vibrations to inform the spider of prey in the web and supporting the weight of both the spider and its prey.

The concentric circular silk is composed of two strands, each with a diameter of 0.7 microns. The outer surface of the circular silk is evenly coated with a sticky liquid containing amino acids and other components, with a water content of 80%.

The goal of studying spider silk is to use genetic engineering technology to mass-produce artificial spider silk for industrial applications. Artificial spider silk can also be used in bulletproof vests and even missile defense systems.

    英科学家研究蛛丝取得成果
    莫道蛛丝不禁风　孰知强度超过钢
    新华社伦敦8月6日电  此间最新一期《自然》杂志发表了英国牛津大学科学家研究蛛丝的成果。
    蛛丝是理想的高技术材料：弹性好，耐冲击性能强，强度为钢丝的5倍。
    蜘蛛网用两种蛛丝织成：
    成辐射形的径向蛛丝是单丝，直径1微米（1毫米等于1000微米，一根头发丝约60微米）。径向蛛丝是蛛网的骨架，用于传递信息振动，告知有猎物投网；并起支持蜘蛛和猎物重量的作用。
    呈同心圆的环状蛛丝由直径为0.7微米的两根丝组成。环状蛛丝的外面均匀地涂了一层粘性液体。粘性液体含有氨基酸等成分，含水量80％。
    研究蛛丝的目的是用遗传工程技术大量生产人造蛛丝用于工业。人造蛛丝还可用于防弹背心以至导弹防御系统。
