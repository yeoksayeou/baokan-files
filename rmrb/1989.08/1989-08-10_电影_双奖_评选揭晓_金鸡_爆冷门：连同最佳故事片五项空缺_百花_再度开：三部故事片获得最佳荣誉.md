People's Daily, Beijing, August 10th - Reporter Yi Kai: The 9th Golden Rooster Awards and the 12th Hundred Flowers Awards for the year 1988 were announced this morning in Beijing. The highest award for comprehensive film art in China, the Golden Rooster Award for Best Feature Film, was declared vacant because none of the three nominated films, "The Evening Bell," "The Republic Will Not Forget," and "The Mischief-Maker," received more than half of the votes from the jury, marking the biggest upset in the history of Chinese film awards.

In addition to the Best Feature Film, the Golden Rooster Awards for Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenwriter, Best Music, and Best Sound Recording were also declared vacant, creating a notable gap.

At a press conference, the Film Association's responsible person, Shi Fangyu, summarized his reflections on this "gap" with the phrase "both unexpected and expected." He believed that while the films of 1988 had achieved some successes, they lacked the groundbreaking, heart-stirring masterpieces of previous years. The results of the Golden Rooster Awards genuinely reflected the current state of the film industry. He emphasized that it is time for the film industry to forge a closer connection with the times and the people.

The 36-year-old young director Wu Ziniu won the Golden Rooster Award for Best Director with his works "The Evening Bell," "Heroes of Joy," and "The Realm of Yin and Yang." Newcomers Tao Zelu and Xie Yuan jointly won the Best Actor Award, while Xu Shouli won the Best Actress Award, and Sun Min won the Best Supporting Actor Award.

The Golden Rooster Award for Best Children's Film went to "Dreamy Season," the Best Animated Film to "Mountain and Water," the Best Documentary to "The Price of Growth - Population and Economy," and the Best Documentary to "The Symphony of Shekou."

The results of the Hundred Flowers Awards, selected by audience voting, are as follows: The Best Feature Films are "Spring Peach," "The Widow Village," and "The Republic Will Not Forget." The Best Actor and Actress Awards went to Jiang Wen and Liu Xiaqing from "Spring Peach," the Best Supporting Actor Award to Shen Junyi, known for his villain roles, and the Best Supporting Actress Award to Gong Li.

A concerning issue is that this year's Hundred Flowers Awards received only 120,000 votes. Of the three films that won the Best Feature Film award, only "Spring Peach" received nearly 70,000 votes, while the other two received only 20,000 votes each. This reflects a certain level of indifference from the audience towards films.

Vice Minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, Chen Haosu, spoke at the "Double Awards" announcement ceremony. He stated that some films being poorly made does not negate the achievements of the entire film industry. He called for society to adopt a positive and supportive attitude towards films.

It is reported that the "Double Awards" ceremony, originally scheduled to be held in Urumqi, Xinjiang, was changed to a "door-to-door" award presentation due to insufficient preparations by relevant Xinjiang departments, which were focused on implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The China Film Association decided that this year's "Double Awards" would not hold a large-scale event.

### 电影“双奖”评选揭晓  “金鸡”爆冷门：连同最佳故事片五项空缺  “百花”再度开：三部故事片获得最佳荣誉

    电影“双奖”评选揭晓
    “金鸡”爆冷门：连同最佳故事片五项空缺
    “百花”再度开：三部故事片获得最佳荣誉
    本报北京8月10日讯　记者易凯报道：1988年度电影第9届“金鸡奖”、第12届“百花奖”今天上午在此间当众开奖。代表我国电影综合艺术最高水平的大奖——“金鸡奖”最佳故事片，由于三部提名电影《晚钟》、《共和国不会忘记》和《顽主》均未获得评委会过半数票而宣告空缺，爆出了新中国电影评奖史上最大的冷门。
    与最佳故事片一齐宣告空缺的还有最佳女配角、最佳编剧、最佳音乐、最佳录音等四项“金鸡奖”，它们在一起构成引人注目的空白。
    影协负责人石方禹在记者招待会上用“既意外又不意外”的感叹概括了自己对这段“空白”的反思。他认为，1988年度电影从总体上讲虽然也取得了不少成绩，但缺少像往年那样令人耳目一新、震撼人心的尖子作品，“金鸡奖”评选结果基本如实地反映了电影界现状。电影是到了应该和时代、人民取得更紧密联系的时候了。
    36岁的青年导演吴子牛，以自己力作《晚钟》、《欢乐英雄》及《阴阳界》摘取了本届“金鸡奖”最佳导演的桂冠。陶泽如、谢园两名新人并列最佳男主角，徐守莉获最佳女主角，孙敏获最佳男配角。
    获本届“金鸡奖”最佳儿童片的是《多梦时节》，最佳美术片为《山水情》，最佳科教片为《增长的代价——人口与经济》，最佳纪录片为《蛇口奏鸣曲》。
    由观众投票选举的“百花奖”结果如下：获最佳故事片的有《春桃》、《寡妇村》、《共和国不会忘记》，最佳男女主角由《春桃》一片中的男女主人公姜文和刘晓庆荣获，最佳男配角为擅演反派角色申军谊获得，最佳女配角为巩俐。
    令人忧虑的是，本届“百花奖”收回票数仅12万多张，获最佳故事片的3部影片，除《春桃》获近7万张选票外，其余2部只有2万多张选票。这从一个侧面反映出观众对电影的冷漠。
    广播电影电视部副部长陈昊苏在“双奖”揭晓会上讲了话，他认为，某些影片拍得不好，并不能否定整个电影界的成绩；他呼吁全社会对电影采取积极支持和爱护的态度。
    据悉：原定在新疆乌鲁木齐举行的“双奖”颁奖活动，因新疆有关部门正集中精力贯彻党中央四中全会精神，准备不足。中国影协决定，今年“双奖”颁奖方式改为送奖上门，不再举行大的活动。
