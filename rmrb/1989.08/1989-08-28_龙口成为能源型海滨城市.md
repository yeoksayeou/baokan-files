    Longkou, a city located on the shores of Bohai Bay in Shandong Province, has in recent years, with the successive construction of national key projects, developed into an important energy-based coastal city in China.

    Along the city's 59-kilometer-long coastline, there is a hidden coal field. Preliminary surveys have revealed a total reserve of 2.6 billion tons both on land and under the sea. The state and local authorities have planned to invest 930 million yuan for its development and construction. Currently, five mines have been built and put into operation, producing nearly 20 million tons of raw coal annually. A large-scale coal gasification plant will be built in the mining area, primarily to supply gas for residential and industrial use in Longkou, Yantai, and Qingdao.
