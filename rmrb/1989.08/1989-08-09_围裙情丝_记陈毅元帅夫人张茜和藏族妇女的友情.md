Looking at a group photo I snapped of Zhang Qie more than 30 years ago, I can almost see her as she was then, tying on this rainbow-colored apron, her voice and smile vivid in my mind.

It was May 1956. Led by Vice Premier Chen Yi, a delegation from the Central Government went to Lhasa, Tibet, to attend the founding ceremony of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Later, they visited Tibet's second-largest city, Shigatse.

One day, several Tibetan women representatives came to pay their respects to the female delegate from the Central Government, Zhang Qie. After the visit, they presented Zhang Qie with a set of traditional Tibetan women's festival attire and asked her to wear it for a group photo.

"Zhang Qie, 'Jo De Ma' (hello)!" The Tibetan women representatives greeted Zhang Qie warmly upon seeing her.

"Comrades, 'Jo De Ma'!" Zhang Qie replied enthusiastically, shaking hands with them. Then, both sides exchanged pure white khatas and wished each other "Tashi Delek" (good luck).

As Zhang Qie tied on the apron, she happily said in a mix of Chinese and Tibetan: "'Tujieqi' (thank you), I really like this precious Tibetan 'Lubu' (treasure). It symbolizes the deep bond between Han and Tibetan sisters, like the 'Gesanmeiduo' (blessed flowers) blooming on the grasslands under the 'Nima' (sun). It makes me cherish this 'Gebasangbu' (happy time)."

The warm and enthusiastic greetings and blessings between them were as deep as the "thousand-foot waters of the Peach Blossom Spring." Their laughter and joy often drifted far away.

After the visit, they bid each other farewell reluctantly. When Zhang Qie returned to the sentry post after seeing off the guests, I and the on-duty sentry looked at the colorful apron with envy. Zhang Qie noticed and stopped, smiling, "Look, this apron not only has a strong ethnic flavor and is very beautiful, but it also carries deep feelings of national unity."

That afternoon, Panchen Erdeni, the first vice chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, hosted a banquet for the Central Government delegation. Many Tibetan women representatives gathered around Zhang Qie, who was wearing the Tibetan apron, for a group photo. Due to my duty, I could only anxiously try to capture the moment, but the platoon leader noticed my urgency and pushed me, saying, "Go, grab the shot!" I managed to squeeze to the front, adjusted the focus, aperture, and speed, and was just about to press the shutter when Zhang Qie and the Tibetan women representatives lowered their raised hands to disperse. I couldn't help but sigh. This sigh was heard by General Chen, who quickly said to Zhang Qie, "Wait, let our soldier journalist take a photo, otherwise, he will be disappointed. He has been paying attention to this apron for a long time."

"Alright!" Zhang Qie smiled and raised her arm with a Tibetan woman again. I finally captured this precious photo.

Time flies. More than 30 years have passed. Now, every time I see this photo, I still remember General Chen's words from his poem "Driving Over Snowy Peaks": "Tomorrow, we will meet friends in Lhasa, and Han and Tibet will share their parting feelings."

    围裙情丝
    ——记陈毅元帅夫人张茜和藏族妇女的友情
    王震学
    望着30多年前我给张茜同志抓拍的这张合影，我眼前仿佛又浮现出当年她系起这条彩虹般的围裙时的音容笑貌来。
    那是1956年5月的一天，由国务院副总理陈毅率领的中央代表团，前赴西藏拉萨，参加庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会，尔后又来到西藏第二大城市——日喀则。
    一天，几位西藏的妇女代表，前来拜见中央代表团的女代表张茜同志。拜见之后，她们把一套藏族妇女最喜爱的节日盛装赠送给张茜同志，并请她穿上合影留念。
    “张茜同志，‘乔德姆’（你好）！”几位前来拜见的藏族妇女代表，见到张茜同志之后，先是亲切的问候。
    “同志们‘乔德姆’！”张茜同志高兴地边热情地和她们握手，边说。接着，双方相互敬献了洁白的哈达，又互祝“扎西德勒”（吉祥如意）！
    张茜同志边系围裙边高兴地用汉藏语掺半地说：“‘图吉其’（谢谢），我非常喜欢这件藏族的珍贵‘罗布’（宝贝），它象征着汉藏姐妹亲如一家的友情，它，就像草原上迎着‘尼玛’（太阳）盛开的‘格桑梅朵’（吉祥花，又名幸福花）一样，使我难忘这‘格巴桑布’（美好的时光）。”
    那亲切而又热情的相互问候、祝愿，颇有
  “桃花潭水深千尺”之感，那欢声笑语，不时地飞向远方。
    拜见结束，她们依依告别。当张茜同志送走客人返回经过哨位时，我和执勤的哨兵，还用羡慕的目光端详这条彩色艳丽的围裙，张茜同志发现后停步笑着说：“看吧，这条围裙不仅有强烈的民族色彩，非常美，而且还有深深的民族大团结的友情。”
    当天下午，西藏自治区筹备委员会第一副主任班禅额尔德尼大师，设宴款待中央代表团，不少藏族妇女代表簇拥着身系这条藏族围裙的张茜同志合影，我因有执勤任务在身，只是焦急的抓不上镜头，还是班长看出了我的急切心情，推了我一把说：“快去抢镜头！”谁知，我好不容易挤到前边，对好焦距，调好光圈、速度，刚准备压快门时，不料张茜已和合影的藏族妇女代表放下了挽起的手，要散去，我情不自禁地叹了一声。这感慨声却被身旁的陈老总听见了，他忙对张茜说：“等等，让咱们的战士记者拍一张，不然，他会感到扫兴的。他对这条围裙早注意上了”。
    “好吧！”张茜同志边笑着边再次与身边的一位女藏胞挽起手臂，我终于拍下了这张珍贵的照片。
    时光如流，30多年过去了，如今，每当我看见这张珍照时，还仿佛记起陈老总当年《乘车过雪峰》中的两句诗：“明日拉萨会亲友，汉藏一家叙别情”。
