Next spring, the Finnish market will see a new type of packaging bag and baby diaper liner made from biodegradable plastic. The price of these products will be comparable to that of paper bags.

As plastic products become increasingly common, their non-biodegradable nature makes them difficult to dispose of and harmful to the environment. A Finnish company has invented a new type of plastic that includes starch additives, allowing microorganisms in nature to easily decompose and biodegrade it. The decomposition rate of this new plastic is ten times faster than that of ordinary plastic.

    芬兰制出可腐烂塑料
    新华社赫尔辛基电　（记者郄霜涛）明年春季，芬兰市场上将出现一种用可腐烂的新型塑料制作的包装袋和婴儿尿布衬，其价格与纸口袋相差无几。
    在塑料制品日益普及之时，塑料难于被分解的特性使之成为难于处理、污染环境的有害垃圾。芬兰一家公司发明的新型塑料中掺入了淀粉物质添加剂，使自然界中的微生物能够十分容易地将其分解、腐烂。其被分解的速度比普通塑料快10倍。
