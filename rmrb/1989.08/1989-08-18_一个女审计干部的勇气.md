The Courage of a Female Auditor

Last July, Qian Yingyu was transferred to the Anhui Electric Power Workers' Sanatorium to handle auditing and review work. As soon as she took office, she began auditing the financial accounts of the institution based on public feedback. She identified issues and promptly reported them to the leadership, proposing solutions. In September of last year, the Perch Lake City Housing Management Bureau sought to collect 2,600 yuan in property survey fees. Qian Yingyu, during her audit, found that the sanatorium's payment was unreasonable, with an excess of 1,300 yuan. She patiently persuaded the housing management department to collect the fees according to the regulations. In March of this year, during the handover of the labor service company's accounts, Qian Yingyu discovered that 30 sets of silk bedspreads purchased for the guesthouse were missing. She immediately conducted an investigation. Some people advised her, "This incident happened nearly a year ago, why bother to offend people?" Qian Yingyu believed that if an auditor finds a problem and does not investigate, it is dereliction of duty. She insisted on getting to the bottom of it and eventually found that 10 sets had been taken by individuals, who were then made to compensate for the loss.

Qian Yingyu not only meticulously audits past financial issues but also dares to tackle "old and difficult" problems. The pharmacy of the sanatorium had not been inventoried since its establishment in 1985. In November of last year, Qian Yingyu and the accountant, despite the pressure, carried out a thorough inventory of the pharmacy with printed inventory sheets. The inventory revealed that the pharmacy's drug procurement was chaotic, with over 5,000 yuan worth of drugs either piled up or spoiled. After the inventory, Qian Yingyu promptly assisted in establishing and improving the pharmacy's management system.

    一个女审计干部的勇气
    钱映玉去年7月调进安徽电力职工疗养院担任审计复核工作。一上任，她就根据群众意见，对院内财务帐目逐项进行审计，发现问题，及时向院领导反映，提出解决办法。去年9月，巢湖市房产管理局要征收房屋勘察费2600元，钱映玉审计时，发现本院付款不合理，多了1300元，便耐心说服了房管部门按文件规定收款。今年3月份，院劳动服务公司会计办理交接手续，钱映玉查帐目、对实物时，发现招待所买的220床丝绸被面少了30床。她当即进行追查，一些人劝她说，这件事已过去近一年时间了，何必得罪人。钱映玉却认为，审计干部发现了问题不追查，那是失职。她坚持一查到底，终于查出私人拿走10床，让拿者补了款。
    钱映玉不但能认真追审过去的帐务问题，而且敢于审计“老大难”问题。院内的药库自1985年建院以来没有进行过盘点。钱映玉去年11月和会计顶住压力，带着印好的盘点表，进行清仓查库。盘点中发现药库进药混乱，积压和霉变药品达5000多元。查完后，钱映玉又及时协助院内建立健全了药库管理制度。
