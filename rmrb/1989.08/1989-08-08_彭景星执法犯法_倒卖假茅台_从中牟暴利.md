Peng Jingxing, former director of the Office of the Judicial Bureau and deputy secretary of the Party branch in the Tongren region of Guizhou, took advantage of his position and work opportunities from July to September last year to engage in speculative trading of Maotai wine with others. They labeled wine priced at 7.5 yuan per bottle as Maotai wine, changed the packaging to that of Maotai wine, and used fake invoices from the Maotai wine factory to sell the wine at prices of 125 yuan and 135 yuan per bottle. They sold a total of 700 cases, amounting to 8,400 bottles of fake Maotai wine. Peng Jingxing alone made a profit of over 190,000 yuan from this, making it a major speculative trading case in the region. Recently, the Intermediate People's Court of the Tongren region sentenced Peng Jingxing to death for the crime of speculative trading. He truly deserves his punishment.

    彭景星执法犯法倒卖假茅台　从中牟暴利
    贵州原铜仁地区司法局办公室主任、党支部副书记彭景星，利用工作与职务之便，从去年7月到9月，伙同他人进行茅台酒的投机倒把活动。他们给进价每瓶7.5元的台渡窖酒，贴上茅台酒的商标，换上茅台酒的包装，使用茅台酒厂的假发票，以每瓶125元、135元的价格卖出。他们前后倒卖假茅台酒700件，计8400瓶，彭景星一人从中牟取暴利19万多元，成为当地一起特大投机倒把案。最近，铜仁地区中级人民法院以投机倒把罪判处彭景星死刑。真是罪有应得。
