Xi'an has taken significant steps to address environmental sanitation issues, particularly focusing on the removal of garbage. The city has made notable progress by accepting public supervision and intensifying efforts to clean up the environment. According to statistics, since August, over 20 "garbage mountains" have been cleared, 925 garbage accumulation points have been cleaned up, and 24,588 tons of garbage have been removed.

As summer approached, the city of Xi'an saw an increase in fruit and vegetable waste, leading to piles of garbage on many streets. The municipal committee and government took these issues seriously after hearing public feedback. Leaders such as Secretary An Qiyuan and Mayor Yuan Zhengzhong personally inspected 68 streets in the city and participated in the cleanup efforts alongside officials and residents.
