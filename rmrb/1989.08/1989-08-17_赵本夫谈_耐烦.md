Title: Zhao Benfu on "Patience"
Author: ZHU XINZHONG

Edition: 8

In the season when willows bloom and peach blossoms open, the author met writer Zhao Benfu in Feng County, Jiangsu.

Since being elected as the vice-chairman of the provincial writers' association in 1985, Zhao Benfu still lives in a small courtyard by the river in Feng County. Some say it is to experience life, others say he does not want to be far from his mother. Zhao Benfu's courtyard has a strong rural atmosphere, with chickens, ducks, geese, cats, and dogs. In his spare time from writing, he plays chess or rides his bicycle around. Feng County is the birthplace of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, Liu Bang, as evidenced by the stone tablet in Zhongyangli. There are also Dragon Spring, Qin bricks, Han tiles, ancient city walls, and ruins of towers.

Zhao Benfu's life seems very leisurely. He is not in a hurry, and he does not rush to write a large number of works. Although many people commission him to write, he does not want to hastily publish his works. Many magazines write to him, saying they are "waiting for rice to cook." Zhao Benfu says: "You can't just give them 'instant noodles' because they are 'waiting for rice to cook.'"

He not only stays calm and unhurried in his writing but also does not rush to find people to write reviews for him. Once a work is written, how critics review it is not something the writer should interfere with. The writer should not stick out his tongue to compete with critics for a living. Critics can criticize your novel to pieces or praise it to the skies. Whether the novel can win an award or the work can be passed down is someone else's business, the business of future generations. Can the writer decide that?

Writing is an individualized labor. One should write according to what one thinks is right, not constantly looking left and right, changing this way and that. If Zhang says it's good that way, then write that way; if Li says it's good this way, then write this way. He says: Literary creation requires "patience," that is, sticking to one's path and avoiding impatience. Once you choose a path, you must patiently walk it. Changing this way and that way is not "patience." Always being impatient will lead to change. Literary paths are like mining in the mountains; it's hard to say where there is ore and where there isn't. You have to patiently search for it. Ore is found through exploration. You have to keep walking, always walking, that's the path. As Lu Xun said: "Paths are made by people walking on them." "Patience" means enduring hardship and sticking to one's own path.

In the past two years, Zhao Benfu's output has not been very high. However, he is very "patient." He devotes more of his energy to exploring some major themes. From a macro perspective, he explores the life consciousness of the nation and the survival state of humanity. His works reflect his continuous progress in artistic individuality. The novella "Dry Creek," published in the fourth issue of "Zhongshan" in 1987, depicts a village after the Yellow River breaches, where people struggle to survive amidst floods and sandstorms. In hardship and difficulty, they reproduce and live tenaciously. This village in the desert has not been extinguished, and in the old riverbed, it has been passed down from generation to generation. To survive, they have paid hard work, humiliation, and done many things they do not want to do. The novella "Bat," published in the sixth issue of "Huacheng" in 1988, depicts an ancient small city with Ghost Hill, Dragon Well, Qin bricks, Han tiles, ancient rivers, and ruined towers. Thus, there are water carriers and all kinds of people. The bitter history of the common people. The title "Bat" itself has symbolic significance. The past and the present, the present and the future, life and death, day and night in nature are all changing silently. The bat is a mysterious small animal that flies out at dusk and returns at dawn. During the day and night, few people see it. It always leads people from day to night and from night to dawn. The transition between day and night is completed silently. It is like the process of life and death, the change of social development, which is not always carried out in a spectacular and earth-shaking manner. The process of social life and the development of life often change silently.

Zhao Benfu says that literary creation requires "loneliness" and "patience," but he is not advocating "isolation." One still needs to face reality.

### 赵本夫谈“耐烦”

    赵本夫谈“耐烦”
    朱信忠　宋体金
    柳绽鸭黄、桃吐蕊芳的季节，笔者在江苏丰县见到了作家赵本夫。
    1985年赵本夫当选为省作协副主席至今，仍住在丰县城河旁一个农家小院里。有人说他是为了体验生活，也有人说他不愿远离母亲……赵本夫居住的小院农家气息很浓，养一群鸡鸭鹅，有猫，有狗。写作之余，或摆盘棋，或登上自行车转一圈。丰县是汉高祖刘邦出生之地，中阳里石碑就是见证，还有龙园泉水、秦砖汉瓦、古城河以及残塔……
    赵本夫的整个生活显得很悠然。他一点也不着急，写东西也不是拚命的赶数量。虽然约稿的人很多，但是他不愿乱发作品，许多刊物来函恳切地说：在“等米下锅”。赵本夫说：不能因为“等米下锅”，就给你们“方便面”。
    他不仅在创作上能沉住气、不着忙，而且从不忙着瞎窜窜找人为自己写评论。作品写出来，评论家如何评论，作家不应该去参与，作家更不应该伸长舌头去与评论家争饭吃。评论家可以把你的小说说得一塌糊涂，也可以说得天花乱坠。至于小说能不能得奖，作品能不能流传，那是别人的事，是后人的事。作家自己能决定吗？
    写作是一种个性化的劳动，要按照自己认为的那个样子去写，不要老是东张西望，慌慌张张的变来变去。张三说那样好，就那样写，李四说这样好，就这样写。他说：搞文学创作需要“耐烦”，也就是认“死门”，且忌浮躁。认准一条路，就要耐着烦走下去。一会儿这样一会儿那样，就是不“耐烦”，老是不“耐烦”，不就变了吗？文学路如深山探矿，很难说哪里有矿、哪里无矿，要耐着烦去找矿、寻矿。矿是探出来的。要走下去，一直走下去，就是一条路。正如鲁迅说的：路是人走出来的。“耐烦”就是要耐着烦坚持走自己的路。
    近两年，赵本夫的作品数量不算太多。但是，他十分“耐烦”。他更多的精力是倾注在探讨一些大的主题。从宏观上，探寻民族的生命意识，人类的生存状态。作品体现了他艺术个性上的不断进步。1987年发表在《钟山》第四期上的中篇小说《涸辙》写一个村庄黄河决口以后，人们在洪水侵袭以及风沙弥漫中如何顽强求生存，在一种艰难困苦中，繁衍生息，顽强生活。这个村子在大漠之中没有泯灭，在故道之中一代一代传下来，为了活下去，付出了辛劳、屈辱，做出了许多自己不愿做的事情。发表在1988年《花城》第六期上的中篇小说《蝙蝠》写一座古老小城，有鬼岗子、有龙井、有秦砖汉瓦、古河残塔，于是便有了挑水夫，也有各色人等。娘子、老妓女、屠狗户……芸芸众生的辛酸史。凸现了小城的沧桑图。作者命题《蝙蝠》本身有象征意义。过去和现在，现在和明天，人的生与死，自然界的白天与黑夜等等都在悄然地变化着。蝙蝠是一种神秘的小动物，傍晚飞出来，黎明飞回去，大白天，大黑夜很少有人看到它。它总是把人们从白天引渡到黑夜、又从黑夜引渡到黎明。而白天和黑夜的交替是在一种无声无息之中完成的。像是生与死的一种进程，社会发展的一种变化，它并不都是在轰轰烈烈、惊天动地中进行的。而这种社会生活的进程、生命发展的进程常常是无声无息地在进行悄然地变化着。
    赵本夫说搞文学需要“寂寞”和“耐烦”当然他不是主张“闭塞”，还得面对现实生活。
