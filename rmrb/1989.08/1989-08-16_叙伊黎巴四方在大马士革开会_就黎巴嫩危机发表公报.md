Yesterday afternoon, representatives from Lebanon's Islamic Patriotic Forces and political parties, along with various organizations of the Palestinian "Salvation Front," convened in Damascus. The meeting was chaired by Syrian Foreign Minister Shara and Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati. A joint statement was issued.

The statement pointed out that Israel's occupation of Lebanon and the continuation of the political sectarian system in Lebanon have laid the foundation for Israel's conspiracy. Only by eliminating Israel's occupation and eradicating the political sectarian system can the Lebanese crisis be resolved. The participants condemned Israel's abduction of Obeid and called on the international community to condemn Israel's terrorist and aggressive actions. They urged the international community to make every effort to secure the release of Obeid and all those detained in Israeli prisons.

The participants firmly supported the Palestinian people's uprising against Israeli rule, asserting that armed struggle is the path to liberating Palestine and safeguarding the Palestinian cause.
