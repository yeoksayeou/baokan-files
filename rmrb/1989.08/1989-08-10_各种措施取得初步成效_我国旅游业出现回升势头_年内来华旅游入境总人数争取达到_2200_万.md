	Various measures have achieved initial results, and China's tourism industry is showing signs of recovery. The goal is to attract 22 million inbound tourists this year.

	BEIJING, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- China's tourism industry is gradually recovering from a significant decline in tourist numbers. Currently, the market is showing signs of improvement, with several Western tour groups visiting China and expressing satisfaction with the safety and overall reception of their trips.

	According to He Guangwei, Deputy Director of the National Tourism Administration, the first four months of this year saw a good start for China's tourism industry, with 586,000 foreign tourists visiting, a 10.2% increase over the same period last year. However, due to the impact of disturbances and riots, the situation began to reverse in May, with a 17.5% decrease in organized foreign tourists compared to the same period last year, resulting in negative growth. In June, the decline reached 64.6%, an unprecedented drop.

	Looking at the first half of the year, the total number of inbound tourists was 12,897,800, a 14.3% decrease from the same period last year. The number of organized foreign tourists received nationwide was 1,776,700, a 15.9% decrease. Of these, the tourism sector received 1,083,000, a 28.3% decrease. The total tourism foreign exchange earnings nationwide were $970 million, a 1% decrease.

	Recent signs indicate that the tourism industry's recovery may be faster than originally predicted. First, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made decisive and correct decisions, laying the foundation for the industry's recovery. Second, a large number of business travelers have returned to China out of their interests, and Taiwanese officials have been allowed to visit the mainland starting July 1, which will help create a new wave of Taiwanese relatives visiting the mainland. Meanwhile, the tourism sector's various proactive measures have achieved some success, and overseas promotional efforts are steadily progressing. Based on this, He Guangwei believes that the adjusted goal of attracting 22 million inbound tourists this year and achieving $1.3 billion in tourism foreign exchange earnings is achievable.

    各种措施取得初步成效
    我国旅游业出现回升势头
    年内来华旅游入境总人数争取达到2200万
    本报北京8月10日讯　记者刘霄报道：我国旅游业正在从客源大滑坡中缓慢地解脱出来。目前客源市场有所回升，一批西方团队开始来华旅游，并对旅程的安全和各方面的接待表示满意。
    据国家旅游局副局长何光暐介绍，今年上半年，我国旅游业起步状态良好，头4个月来华旅游的外国人为58.6万，比去年同期增长10.2％。由于动乱和暴乱的影响，5月份形势开始逆转，全国有组织接待的外国游客比去年同期下降17.5％，呈负增长；6月份比去年同期下降64.6％，出现了前所未有的大滑坡。
    综观上半年情况，来华旅游入境总人数1289.78万人，比去年同期减少14.3％；全国有组织接待的外国旅游者177.67万人，比去年同期减少15.9％；其中旅游部门接待108.3万人，减少28.3％。全国旅游外汇收入9.7亿美元，减少1％。
    最近一系列迹象表明，我国旅游业走出谷底的步伐会比原先预测的要快些。首先，党中央、国务院采取了果断、正确的决策，为旅游业的回升奠定了基础。其次，大量的商务旅游者出于在华利益的考虑已陆续返华，加上台湾公务人员获准于7月1日起可以回大陆探亲，有助于形成台胞探亲旅游的新高潮。与此同时，旅游部门采取的各种积极应变措施取得了一定成效，对外宣传招揽工作稳步推开。鉴于此，何光暐认为，年内来华旅游入境总人数争取达到2200万人，全国旅游创汇争取达到13亿美元的调整目标，是可以实现的。
