The Yellow River basin, the cradle of Chinese civilization and ancient culture, has become a crucial energy base in China after 10 years of accelerated development and construction during the reform era. People now refer to it as the "energy corridor."

Currently, the river basin has gradually formed an energy industry layout: hydropower in the upper reaches, coal in the middle reaches, and oil in the lower reaches. According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, these bases provided 32% of the nation's coal, 29% of the crude oil, and 10% of the hydropower.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, with the treatment of the Yellow River, the mineral resources buried in the basin have been gradually explored and developed to serve economic construction. According to data released by relevant departments, the proportion of proven energy mineral reserves in the Yellow River basin to the national total is: coal 46.14%, oil 25.6%. At the same time, the installed capacity of water resources that can be developed is over 28 million kilowatts.

The development and construction of the Yellow River basin energy base began with hydropower. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, the state took the utilization of hydropower resources in the upper reaches of the Yellow River as a key development area, successfully carrying out hydropower cascade development and construction on the main stream of the Yellow River. The Liujiaxia, Qingtongxia, Yankouxia, and Bapanxia hydropower stations were all completed before the 1970s, with a total installed capacity of 1.96 million kilowatts. Among them, the Liujiaxia hydropower station's annual power generation exceeds the national power generation in 1949. Since the 1980s, the Longyangxia hydropower station, known as the "first dam of the ten-thousand-li Yellow River," has been built, and the construction of the Lijiaxia hydropower station has begun. It is understood that there are still several hydropower stations to be built in the cascade development of the upper reaches of the Yellow River.

The oil base in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has risen with the progress of China's science and technology. In 1964, the Shengli Oilfield drilled the first well. Since the 1980s, oilfield exploration and development have continued to advance. In 1988, the annual crude oil production was 33 million tons, accounting for 24% of the national annual crude oil production, second only to the Daqing Oilfield. The Zhongyuan Oilfield, which the State Council decided to accelerate exploration and development construction in 1983, has the potential to become another natural gas production base in eastern China.

The coal base in the middle reaches of the Yellow River includes the Jungar, Shenfu Dongsheng, and Shanxi, Yuxi coalfields. Some experts believe that the exploitation of the large coalfields on both banks of the middle reaches of the Yellow River marks a strategic shift in China's coal mining from the east to the west. It is estimated that by the 2030s, this area will provide approximately 600 million tons of coal to the country annually.

### 上游水电  中游煤炭  下游石油  黄河两岸成了能源流域  改革十年来开发加快  黄土带崛起能源工业

    上游水电  中游煤炭  下游石油
    黄河两岸成了能源流域
    改革十年来开发加快  黄土带崛起能源工业
    据新华社郑州8月29日电  （记者杨英兰）我国历史发源地和古文化的摇篮黄河流域，经过改革10年的加快开发建设，成为我国举足轻重的三大常规能源基地。人们把它称为“能源的流域”。
    目前，大河上下已逐渐形成能源工业的布局：上游水电基地、中游煤炭基地、下游石油基地。据不完全统计，1988年，这些基地提供了占全国32％的煤炭，29％的原油，10％的水电。
    建国以来，随着黄河的治理，沉睡在流域地下的矿产资源被逐步勘探开发出来，为经济建设服务。据有关部门公布的勘探数字，黄河流域已探明能源矿产地质储量占全国储量的比例为：煤炭46.14％，石油25.6％。同时，水能资源可开发的装机容量为2800多万千瓦。
    黄河流域能源基地的开发建设从水电开始。建国初期，国家就把黄河上游水能资源的利用作为开发重点，成功地在黄河干流上进行水电梯级开发建设。刘家峡、青铜峡、盐锅峡和八盘峡4座水电站，全部在70年代前建成，总装机容量196万千瓦，其中刘家峡水电站一年发电量就超过1949年全国的发电量。进入80年代以来，继续兴建了被称为“万里黄河第一坝”的龙羊峡水电站，并开工建设李家峡水电站。据了解，黄河上游梯级开发待建的水电站还有几座。
    黄河下游石油基地是伴随着我国科学技术的进步而崛起的。1964年，胜利油田打出了第一口井。进入80年代以来，油田勘探开发不断向前发展，1988年原油年产量3300万吨，占全国原油年产量24％，产量仅次于大庆油田。1983年国务院决定加快勘探开发建设的中原油田，有可能建成为我国东部地区又一个天然气生产基地。
    黄河中游煤炭基地包括准格尔、神府东胜和山西、豫西煤田。一些专家认为，黄河中游两岸大煤田的开采，标志着中国煤炭开采的重点从东部向西部作战略性转移。预计下世纪30年代，这里每年将向全国提供约6亿吨煤。
