The once heavily polluted ancient channels of Zhong River and Dong River in the urban area of Hangzhou have now been transformed into rivers with clear water, well-arranged banks, and beautiful scenery. The greenery, flowers, bridges, pavilions, rockeries, and sculptures along the rivers create a picturesque view.

Zhong River and Dong River are man-made ancient channels with a history of over 1,000 years. Zhong River is 9.6 kilometers long, and Dong River is 4 kilometers long, running from south to north through the urban area of Hangzhou. In the past, due to sediment accumulation, blocked river mouths, and industrial wastewater and garbage dumped by residents along the rivers, the water became black and foul-smelling. This significantly marred the reputation of the famous city of Hangzhou.

To remove this stain, the State Council, Zhejiang Province, and Hangzhou City decided to jointly invest in a comprehensive renovation of the two ancient channels. The first phase of the project includes: laying 16 kilometers of sewage interception pipes along the banks of Zhong River and Dong River; constructing a 7-kilometer-long second sewage trunk line in Hangzhou; building a large-scale sewage treatment plant capable of processing 400,000 tons of sewage per day; constructing a rolling weir and a water level regulation gate at the outlet of Dong River connected to the Grand Canal to control the water level; and dredging the riverbed, planting trees, arranging sculptures, and establishing riverside parks along the rivers. After more than six years of construction, the first phase of the project has recently passed the national final inspection and has been officially put into use.

Once the sediment of time is removed, the river regains its youth. Zhang Aiping, the commander who led the troops to liberate Hangzhou, personally inscribed the "Silver River Returns" stele to praise the revival of these two ancient rivers.

    “银河双落”杭州城
    治理中河东河古道　首期工程圆满竣工
    本报讯　昔日污染严重的杭州市区两条古河道——中河、东河，如今变成了流水潺潺、岸石齐整的河道。绿树鲜花、道桥亭榭、假山雕塑交相掩映的美景，呈现在人们眼前。
    中河、东河是人工开挖的古河道，距今已有1000多年历史。中河长9.6公里，东河长4公里，由南至北纵贯杭州市区。过去，由于泥沙淤积，河道入口阻塞，再加上工厂排放的污水和沿河居民倾倒的垃圾，使河水发黑发臭。驰名中外的名城杭州因之大煞风景。
    为摘掉这顶破脏帽子，国务院、浙江省和杭州市决定共同投资，彻底根治这两条古河道。第一期工程包括：在中、东河两岸埋设长16公里的污水截流管；新建一条长7公里的杭州第二污水干管；兴建一座日一级处理污水40万吨的大型污水处理厂；在连接大运河的东河出水口建造滚水坝、调节水闸，以控制水位；沿河驳坎、疏浚河床、遍植树木、布置雕塑和建立河畔公园等。经过6年多的施工，第一期工程近日通过国家总验收，正式交付使用。
    岁月的沉积一旦清除，河流便恢复了青春。当年曾率部解放杭州的兵团首长张爱萍亲笔题写“银河双落”碑，称颂这两条古河的复活。
