As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow"—Anshan Steel Corporation has consistently emphasized ideological and political work, which has motivated the broad masses of workers to produce more. The production of steel and iron has respectively completed the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" targets two and four years ahead of schedule, and profits and taxes have increased by 10% annually for five consecutive years. In June of this year, despite the disturbances and tight energy and raw material supplies, all eight major products met their production targets.

Anshan Steel Corporation and its Party Committee believe that as China's steel base, Anshan Steel must adhere to the socialist direction under the leadership of the Party, producing both steel and talented individuals. The company leadership has proposed: "Production must be balanced with ideological and political work," and "To manage an enterprise well, one must rely not only on technology and management but also on the guiding role of ideological and political work." The Party Committee has proposed that ideological and political work must revolve around production, serving and supporting production and construction. The Party and the government have insisted on working together, ensuring that ideological and political work is not only not abandoned but also continuously strengthened. Past erroneous practices from the "Leftist" era have been eliminated; outdated methods are no longer used; successful methods from the past that are still effective today continue to be used; and new, effective methods are constantly being created.

They have drawn from the examples of old heroes and models like Meng Tai and Wang Chonglun to summarize the enterprise spirit: innovation, pragmatism, struggle, and dedication. They then use this spirit to cultivate a new generation of "Anshan Steel people." This year, during the first quarter, when the power supply was tight and production faced the risk of halting, the workers were anxious, and the cadres were worried. The company's Party and government leaders promoted the Anshan Steel spirit, proposing "Less complaining, more working." The workers, inspired by Meng Tai's spirit, voluntarily suggested, "Think more about solutions and work harder." To save electricity, offices and hallways were kept dark, workers did not watch television or use refrigerators, and large light bulbs in the workshops were replaced with smaller ones, saving 260,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, equivalent to the electricity consumption of a medium-sized factory. When funds were tight, the broad masses of workers, inspired by the Anshan Steel spirit, raised 24 million yuan in cash within a week, solving the urgent production needs.

They focus ideological and political work on production difficulties. In 1987, during the construction of the wire rod project, foreign experts estimated it would take 28-30 months to complete, but General Manager Li Huazhong said: "We will complete it in 13 months." During the construction, the Party and government worked together to strengthen ideological and political work; the trade union organized labor competitions; the youth league organized youth shock teams. Indeed, it was completed in just 13 months, which is only 40% of the time estimated by foreign experts. Subsequent projects were almost all completed at the same speed, earning the title "Anshan Steel Speed" from some experts.

    思想政治工作常抓不懈
    鞍钢多出人才多产钢材
    本报鞍山8月11日电　记者段心强报道：种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆——鞍钢坚持思想政治工作，调动了广大职工的生产积极性。钢、铁产量分别提前2年、4年完成“七五”规划指标，利税连续5年以10％的速度递增。今年6月，在动乱干扰，能源、原材料紧张的情况下，八大产品全面完成计划。
    鞍钢公司和公司党委认为，鞍钢作为中国的钢铁基地，必须在党的领导下，坚持社会主义方向，出钢材、出人才，公司领导提出：“抓生产必须与思想政治工作并重”，“搞好企业不仅要靠技术、管理，而且要发挥思想政治工作的导向作用”；党委提出：思想政治工作必须围绕生产进行，服从于、服务于生产建设。党政坚持同种“一块地”、同唱“一台戏”，思想政治工作不但没有被“改造”掉，而且不断加强。过去“左”的年代的一些错误做法，受到清除；一些过时的做法，不再使用；过去成功至今仍有效的做法继续使用；新的行之有效的方法，不断创造。
    他们从孟泰、王崇伦等老英雄模范人物身上，总结出企业精神：创新、求实、拚争、奉献。然后用这种精神培育新一代“鞍钢人”。今年一季度，电力供应紧张，面临停产的危险，职工着急，干部心焦。公司党政领导宣传鞍钢精神，提出“少发牢骚多干活”，职工发扬孟泰精神，主动提出：“多想办法干好活”。为了节电，办公室、走廊一律不亮灯，职工不看电视，不用冰箱，车间里大灯泡换小灯泡，一天节电26万度，相当于一个中型厂矿的用电量。资金紧张，广大职工发扬鞍钢精神，一周内凑集2400万元现金，解决了生产的燃眉之急。
    把生产的难点作为思想政治工作的重点。1987年线材工程建设中，外国专家说要28—30个月完成，可总经理李华忠说：我们要用13个月的时间建成。在施工中，党政齐心协力，加强思想政治工作；工会搞劳动竞赛；青年团搞青年突击队，果然只用了13个月就完工了。建设时间只相当于外国专家测算的40％。以后几个工程几乎都以同样的速度完成，被一些专家称为“鞍钢速度”。
