The 620 cubic meter blast furnace at the Handan Iron and Steel Group in Hebei Province completed its overhaul in just 39 days. On August 9, the first batch of iron was successfully smelted, setting a new record for the shortest overhaul period for a medium-sized blast furnace in local iron and steel enterprises nationwide.

In China, the overhaul period for medium-sized blast furnaces in local iron and steel enterprises generally remains at over 50 days. Twelve years ago, the first overhaul of this blast furnace at Handan Steel also took 59 days. This time, Handan Steel planned to complete the overhaul in 45 days. Over 30 construction teams worked tirelessly, ultimately reducing the overhaul period by another 6 days.
