Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 26th.

The 95th International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting is currently being held in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico.

The one-week-long meeting is attended by 92 representatives, including IOC executive committee members and the president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, He Zhenliang. They will elect new leaders for the IOC and discuss issues related to the next Olympic Games.

He Zhenliang, who is staying at the Hilton International Hotel in San Juan, said in a telephone interview tonight that the meeting will elect a new IOC president. Since Antonio Samaranch, who has held the position since 1980, is the only candidate, he is expected to be re-elected for another four-year term.

The meeting will also elect a new vice president. It is reported that many members of the IOC hope that He Zhenliang will run for this position. The IOC currently has three vice presidents: Prince de Merode of Belgium, former Canadian Olympic Committee president Paul Poulin, and Moubarak of Senegal (currently a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague). The meeting may approve the following two decisions: starting from the 1992 Olympics, the age limit for Olympic football players will be set at 23 years old; and tennis will be confirmed as an official Olympic event.

    国际奥委会大会在圣胡安举行
    新华社华盛顿8月26日电　（记者陆文岳）第95届国际奥委会大会目前正在波多黎各首府圣胡安举行。
    参加为期一周的本届国际奥委会大会的共有92位代表，其中包括国际奥委会执委、中国奥委会主席何振梁。他们将改选国际奥委会主要领导人和讨论一些与下届奥运会有关的问题。
    下榻于圣胡安希尔顿国际大饭店的何振梁今晚在接受记者的长途电话采访时说，这次大会将改选国际奥委会主席。由于从1980年担任该职务至今的安东尼奥·萨马兰奇是唯一的候选人，所以他可望继续当选下届（任期4年）国际奥委会主席。
    本届大会还将增选一位副主席。据悉，国际奥委会中已有许多人希望何振梁竞选这一职务。国际奥委会现有3位副主席，他们是比利时的梅罗德亲王、加拿大前奥委会主席庞德和塞内加尔的穆巴伊（现任海牙国际法院大法官）。本届大会可能批准下列两个决定：从1992年奥运会起，把奥运会足球队员的年龄限制在23岁以下；确认网球为正式奥运会比赛项目。
