On May 2, the circular spinning machines at our county's cotton textile mill, which were operating normally, suddenly stopped with a series of "clack, clack" noises. Upon inspection, the workers were astonished to find bricks mixed in with the cotton. They then opened 38 unopened bales of cotton and discovered that each bale contained bricks and brick pieces. The number of bricks ranged from six to over a dozen per bale, with each brick weighing an average of 2.6 kilograms. The mill was forced to halt production.

This batch of cotton, totaling 80 tons and 1280 bales, was purchased from Guozhuang Village in Xincun County, Shandong Province, in April of this year. In addition to the bricks and brick pieces, the quality of the cotton did not meet the agreed-upon standard for grade 4 cotton in most cases. The factory director stated that this batch of substandard cotton caused them a direct economic loss of 200,000 yuan. We hope that the relevant authorities will promptly investigate and address this issue.

    棉花包里塞砖头
    5月2日，我县棉纺织厂正常运转的圆盘机，在一阵“咔啦、咔啦”的怪叫声中，突然停机。检查时，工人们吃惊地发现棉花中卷着一块块砖头，随即拆开尚未开包的38包棉花，看到棉包中都掺有砖块、砖坯，每包少则6块，多则十几块，平均每块砖头重2.6公斤。工厂被迫停产。
    这批棉花是这个厂于今年4月从山东莘县燕店郭庄购进的，共80吨，1280包。这批棉花除了掺有砖头、砖坯之外，质量也绝大多数达不到双方协议的4级棉花的标准。厂长说，这批劣质棉花给他们造成直接经济损失20万元。希望有关部门迅速查处。
