    Chongqing "Jialing" motorcycle economic alliance was born 9 years ago on September 26 this year. Over the past 9 years, they have leveraged the collective advantages of enterprises, organized group competitions, and demonstrated the powerful force of unity. Now, the alliance has grown to 12 member companies, with 220 long-term cooperative enterprises, forming a powerful economic group.

    Group competition has kept "Jialing" motorcycles in an unbeatable position. Over the past decade, the Chinese motorcycle market has experienced "three ups and three downs." Due to the advantages of the "Jialing" motorcycle group, with its low cost, high quality, large batch production, and high level of localization, it has withstood the test and gained a high reputation in the market. In 1987, 180,000 vehicles were sold, and by this year, 134,000 vehicles were sold from January to July. The motorcycles are not only sold to various provinces and cities across the country but are also exported to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. The economic benefits of the enterprise are also continuously improving. Now, all 12 companies within the alliance are profitable, making significant contributions to the country.

    重庆“嘉陵”驶向全国
    今年9月26日，是重庆“嘉陵”摩托车经济联合体诞生9周年。9年来，他们发挥企业间的群体优势，组织集团竞争，显示了联合起来的强大威力。现在联合体成员已发展到12家，长期协作企业220家，形成了一个强大的经济集团。
    集团竞争，使“嘉陵”摩托车始终立于不败之地。近10年来，我国摩托车市场经历了“三起三落”。由于“嘉陵”摩托发挥集团的优势，以成本低、质量高、批量大、国产化水平高而经受住了考验，在市场上赢得了较高的声誉。1987年售车18万辆，今年1至7月售车达13.4万辆，不仅销售到国内各省市，而且还远销欧、美和东南亚等国家，企业的经济效益也不断提高。现在联合体内的12家企业家家盈利，为国家作出了重大贡献。
