	Li Guixian, at the meeting of the heads of the People's Bank of China's provincial branches, proposed that the fight against corruption, maintaining integrity, and strengthening the construction of the team should be an important task for the bank at present and in the future.

	In the first half of this year, economic cases in the financial system, especially major cases, have increased significantly. The practice of using loans for personal gain has also evolved from the general practice of taking bribes to more serious forms of corruption. Some use loans to pressure enterprises and companies to arrange jobs for their children and relatives; some demand that enterprises help with personal home renovations, or provide cheap building materials and labor to build private houses; some first give loans to enterprises and then borrow money from enterprises for their relatives to do business; others buy cheap household appliances or local specialties from enterprises.

	Li Guixian said that those who engage in the practice of using loans for personal gain, and even dare to break the law and engage in economic crimes, are indeed a small number in the financial workforce. However, since the bank is a credit institution and plays a very important role in the overall operation of the national economy, we must not underestimate the damage and harm to the bank's reputation caused by these corrupt behaviors.

	Li Guixian demanded that all levels of banks and insurance companies organize forces to concentrate on a period of time to conduct a comprehensive investigation of economic crime cases, focusing on investigating and dealing with cases of party members and leading cadres who violate laws and disciplines. Those who should be punished by criminal law, regardless of who they are, should be handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment, and there should be no leniency or indulgence.

    李贵鲜在人民银行分行长会议上提出
    金融系统全面清查经济犯罪
    不能让腐败行为破坏银行信誉
    本报北京8月6日讯　记者施明慎报道：在昨天召开的人民银行全国分行长会议上，国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜提出，要把惩治腐败、保持廉洁、切实加强队伍建设，作为银行当前和今后的一项重要工作抓紧抓好。
    今年上半年，金融系统经济案件、特别是大案要案大幅度上升，以贷谋私情节也由过去一般性的吃、拿、卡、要向更为严重的腐败行为发展。有的通过发放贷款，要企业、公司安排自己的子女亲友；有的要企业为个人装修住房，或解决廉价建材和施工力量以营造私房；有的先给企业贷款，再从企业借款为亲友经商使用；还有的从企业购买廉价家用电器等商品或土特产品。
    李贵鲜说，那些搞以贷谋私不正之风，甚至不惜以身试法，大搞经济犯罪活动的人，在金融职工队伍中毕竟是极少数。但由于银行是信用机构，在整个国民经济运行中担负着十分重要的任务，绝不能低估这些腐败行为造成的损失和对银行信誉的破坏。
    李贵鲜要求各级银行、保险公司，要组织力量，集中一段时间，对经济犯罪案件进行一次全面清查，重点查处党员领导干部违法违纪案件。凡依法该受刑事惩罚的，不管是谁，一律交司法部门惩罚，决不能姑息迁就。
