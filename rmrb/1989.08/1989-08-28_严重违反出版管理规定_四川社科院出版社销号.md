	Seriously Violating Publishing Management Regulations,
	Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences Press is Revoked

	Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 28th. Reporter Luomaocheng reports: Sichuan provincial authorities have decided to expel Zhang Li, the president of the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences Press, and editor Li Jiwei from the Party, remove Zhang Li from his position as president of the press, and reduce his salary by two levels. Given that Zhang and Li's actions have violated the law, judicial authorities are currently handling the case according to law. The press's publishing license has been revoked by the State Press and Publication Administration.

	The Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences Press was established in March 1983. Its mission was to publish academic works, compilations, and various periodicals by researchers from the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences. However, the press has seriously violated publishing management regulations, exceeding its professional scope, and published many books with low taste and unhealthy content, such as "Heavenly Strange Cases." In 1985, it was punished by the State Publishing Administration with a suspension of business for rectification. Particularly serious was the press's publication in September 1988 of the anti-communist book "The Complete Biography of Du Yuesheng." This book contains numerous insults against the Communist Party of China, its leaders, and patriotic democrats, defames the workers' movement and the people's revolutionary struggles, praises Chiang Kai-shek's "anti-communist purge" and other counter-revolutionary crimes, and glorifies Du Yuesheng. The publication of such an anti-communist book is extremely rare in the history of publishing in New China and has had a detrimental political impact on society.

    严重违反出版管理规定
    四川社科院出版社销号
    本报成都8月28日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省有关部门决定开除擅自出版反共书籍《杜月笙全传》的省社科院出版社社长张力、编辑李嘉玮的党籍，撤销张力出版社社长职务，降两级工资。鉴于张、李的行为已触犯了刑律，司法机关正在依法处理。该社的社号被新闻出版署撤销。
    四川省社科院出版社是1983年3月成立的。该社任务是出版四川省社会科学院科研人员的论著、资料汇编和本院编的各种刊物。但是，该社严重违反出版管理规定，超出专业分工范围，出版了许多诸如《天国奇案》等格调低下、内容不健康的图书，曾于1985年受到国家出版局停业整顿的处分。特别严重的是该社于1988年9月出版了反共书籍《杜月笙全传》。此书多处辱骂中国共产党、共产党领导人及爱国民主人士，诬蔑工人运动和人民革命斗争，赞颂蒋介石“清党”等反革命罪行，美化吹捧杜月笙。这样一本反共的书籍得以出版，在新中国出版史上极为罕见，在社会上造成恶劣的政治影响。
