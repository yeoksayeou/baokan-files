The Chinese Academy of Sciences has established more than 50 ecological research stations across the country to strengthen research and monitoring of China's deteriorating ecological environment.

Over the past few decades, problems such as deforestation, overgrazing, soil erosion, environmental pollution, and desertification have seriously affected China's economic development and ecological improvement. To accurately understand the changes and processes of renewable natural resources and the ecological environment, and to explore reasonable management methods and establish demonstration sites for reasonable management models, CAS has established ecological research stations covering major natural, semi-natural, and artificial ecosystems across the country.

It is understood that these field stations conduct comprehensive, regular, and continuous monitoring and research on the ecological environment nationwide, providing necessary information for national decision-making departments to formulate timely prevention and remediation strategies. At the same time, these field stations have become important bases for Chinese scientists to conduct biological and geological research, as well as international cooperation, and provide typical demonstration sites for regional development and comprehensive environmental governance in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other sectors.

Relevant departments of CAS revealed that during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, CAS plans to allocate 50 million yuan to strengthen the equipment of the field stations and use computers to connect these more than 50 ecological stations into a network, building the Chinese Ecological Research Network. Experts believe that the establishment of this network marks that China's research and demonstration work on renewable natural resources and ecological environment management will enter a new stage.

    中科院加强生态监测
    五十多个野外站将构成生态研究网络
    据新华社北京8月1日电　（记者李希光）中国科学院已在全国各地建立了50多个野外生态研究站，对我国不断恶化的生态环境加强研究和监测。
    几十年来，森林过伐、草场过牧、水土流失、环境污染及沙漠化等已严重影响我国经济的发展和生态环境的改善。为了准确了解可更新自然资源与生态环境的变化与过程，探索合理经营的途径以及建立合理经营模式的场所，中科院在全国各地建立了覆盖主要的自然、半自然和人工生态系统的生态研究站。
    据了解，这些野外站通过在全国范围内对生态环境进行综合、定期、持续的监测研究，为国家决策部门及时制定防范、整治对策提供了必要的信息。同时，这些野外站还成为我国科学家从事生物学、地学研究以及国际合作的重要基地，并为各地区的开发及农、林、牧业建设和环境综合治理提供了典型示范的场所。
    中科院有关部门透露，在“八五”期间，中科院拟拨款5000万元加强野外站的装备，并利用计算机将这50多个生态站联结成网，建成中国生态研究网络。专家们认为，这一网络的建成，标志着中国的可更新自然资源与生态环境研究和经营示范工作将进入一个新的阶段。
