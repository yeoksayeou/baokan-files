    Over 90% of Companies in Guangdong Undergo Rectification
    Our reporter Liang Zhaoming reports from Guangzhou: The rectification of companies in Guangdong has entered a critical stage. Recently, the provincial government has demanded that relevant departments strengthen organizational leadership, conduct thorough checks and verifications, and prevent superficial compliance.

    It is understood that Guangdong Province has listed 27,700 companies for rectification, of which 26,300 have been rectified, accounting for 95%. Among the party and government officials (including retired and retired officials) serving in these companies, 3,017 have resigned from their company or government positions. The Guangdong Provincial Government has demanded that the rectification work be carried out to the end with a spirit of tackling "hard bones."

    广东清理整顿公司逾九成
    本报广州8月1日电　记者梁兆明报道：广东清理整顿公司工作已进入关键阶段。近日，省政府要求各有关部门进一步加强组织领导，逐个检查核实，防止走过场。
    据悉，广东省列入清理整顿范围的公司2.77万多户，已清理2.63万多户，占95％。党政机关干部（包括离、退休干部）在公司任职人员共3017名，已有2496名辞去公司或机关职务。广东省政府要求以啃“硬骨头”精神，把清理工作进行到底。
