Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 24th.

More than 1,200 university graduates assigned to work in the Shengli Oilfield are preparing to go to the grassroots level and production frontlines for training. This practice, which has been maintained for many years in the oilfield, has enabled young people who have taken up their posts to quickly become outstanding individuals.

Flipping through the list of advanced individuals in the Shengli Oilfield, one can find many university graduates who have rapidly grown through training at the grassroots level and production frontlines. Statistics show that from 1981 to 1988, the oilfield accepted a total of 6,063 university graduates. Among them, more than one-third were evaluated as labor models, advanced workers, dual civilization standard-bearers, and new Long March shock troops by various levels of units. They have become technical backbones in geological surveys, drilling, downhole operations, oil extraction, and other production frontlines.

Hu Yonghong, who was promoted to deputy director of the Production Office of the First Drilling Company last year, is a graduate of the East China Petroleum Institute in 1982. During his three years as a drilling team leader, he led his team to quickly drill many high-yield oil wells and set a national drilling record, earning him the title of oilfield dual civilization standard-bearer. There are also some university graduates who, after training for more than two years on the production frontlines, quickly produced research results once they arrived at research units due to their practical knowledge.

    胜利油田培养人才之路
    大学毕业先上基层一线
    据新华社济南8月24日电  （记者张绥文）1200多名分配到胜利油田工作的高等学校应届毕业生，已准备去基层工作和生产第一线锻炼。在这里坚持多年的这一做法，使走上岗位的青年人迅速成才。
    翻开胜利油田先进人物名册，有许多在基层工作和生产第一线锻炼而迅速成长起来的高校毕业生。据统计，全油田在1981年至1988年共接受高等学校毕业生6063人，其中1／3以上被各级单位评为劳动模范、先进工作者、双文明标兵和新长征突击手，他们在地质调查、钻井、井下作业、采油等生产第一线成为技术骨干。
    去年提为钻井一公司生产办公室副主任的胡永宏，是华东石油学院1982年毕业生。当钻井队长的3年时间里，带领队员快速打出许多高产油井，并创一项全国钻井纪录，被评为油田双文明标兵。还有一些在生产第一线锻炼两年以上的高校毕业生，因为有了实践知识，一到科研单位就很快拿出研究成果。
