The country with the largest population in the world is China, the province with the largest population in China is Sichuan, and the county with the largest population in Sichuan is Hechuan.

Hechuan has an average of only 8.3 mu of arable land per person. With a large population and limited land, if it were in a coastal area, it could take the "three-in-one, one-supplement" and industrial-leaning approach. However, Hechuan is located in the eastern part of the Sichuan Basin. Among its 1.47 million people, 1.3 million are farmers, making it a typical agricultural county. If it were in the western plain of Sichuan, it could enjoy the advantages of favorable weather and geography. But Hechuan is located in a hilly area where the Jialing River, Fu River, and Qu River converge, suffering from floods every year.

In terms of population, arable land, and grain production, Hechuan is faced with a world-class problem. However, it is precisely this severe challenge that has driven the people of Hechuan to work hard and come up with extraordinary solutions.

In this land, in 1988, 746,000 tons of grain, 1.18 million pigs, and 6,848 tons of cocoons were produced, all ranking first in the province. The production of citrus fruits also ranks among the top in the province.

How did Hechuan achieve this?

A responsible comrade from the county committee said, more than 60% of Sichuan's population and nearly 60% of its arable land are concentrated in hilly areas. We should find a path for the economic development and prosperity of the people in hilly areas. Indeed, if the economy of hilly areas is developed, Sichuan's development will be faster.

In this sense, Hechuan's agriculture can be seen as a microcosm of Sichuan's agriculture.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the reform and opening-up brought vitality to Hechuan. The county committee and county government, based on Hechuan's actual situation, took grain production as the foundation, and developed a coordinated approach to planting, breeding, and processing, forming a new pattern of agricultural, sideline, and industrial development. In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the county reached 111.8 million yuan, an increase of 2.84 times compared to 1978. The per capita income of rural residents was 580 yuan, an increase of 8 times compared to 1978.

The rapid development of Hechuan's economy reflects the spirit of hard work and perseverance of Hechuan's leaders and people. In the development of commodity economy, county and district leaders went to the fields and mountains, demonstrating and promoting new technologies and measures.

In 1981, Hechuan suffered a once-in-a-century flood, submerging the entire county seat and 59 townships. Despite this, the county's total grain production that year still increased by 35 million kilograms compared to the previous year. This year, after the floods came the drought, with the disaster exceeding that of 1981. The hardworking and brave people of Hechuan proposed the goal of ensuring that the annual production plan would not be reduced. They relied on their strong belief in the Party and their unyielding spirit of hard struggle.

On August 9, we visited Nanxi Village in Shaxi Township and met with Zhang Guanyun, the secretary of the village party branch. He said that the village has an average of only 0.67 mu of arable land per person. In the past, many people wandered to other places. Now, relying on the Party's policies and hard work, it has become a prosperous village with an average of 1,000 kilograms of fruit, 1,000 yuan, and 1,000 kilograms of grain per person. Nanxi Village is not the most outstanding village in Hechuan County; it is just one of hundreds of villages. In 1940, Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao came to Hechuan County's Yucai School and told the teachers and students about the beautiful prospects of a socialist society. Now, this beautiful scene is gradually becoming a reality.

    八分地上的大文章
    ——丘陵大县合川掠影
    世界上第一人口大国是中国，中国第一人口大省是四川，四川第一人口大县是合川。
    合川，人均耕地只有8分3厘。人多地少，如处在沿海地区，可以走“三来一补”、向工业倾斜的路子。但合川位于四川盆地东部，在147万人口中，有130万是农民，是典型的农业县；如果放在川西平原，可以得天时地利之便。而合川地处丘陵，嘉陵江、涪江、渠江三江汇合处，年年洪涝为患。
    在人口、耕地、粮食这三个基本问题上，合川注定面对一道世界难题。但是，正是这种严峻的挑战，使合川人民艰苦奋斗，做出了不同凡响的回答。
    就在这片土地上，1988年生产粮食74.6万吨，肥猪118万头，蚕茧6848吨，均居全省第一，柑桔产量也名列省内前茅。
    合川的路是怎样走出来的？
    县委一位负责同志说，四川有60％以上的人口、近60％的耕地集中在丘陵地区。我们应为丘陵地区走出一条经济发展、人民致富的路子。是的，丘陵的经济搞好了，四川的发展就会更快。
    从这个意义上说，合川的农业可称为四川农业的缩影。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，改革开放的大潮给合川带来了生机。县委、县政府从合川的实际出发，以粮食生产为基础，因地制宜，走种植业、养殖业、加工业协调发展的商品性开发农业的路子，形成了农、副、工全面发展的新格局。1988年全县工农业总产值达到11.18亿元，比1978年增加2.84倍，农村人均收入580元，比1978年增加8倍。
    合川经济的迅速发展，反映了合川县领导和合川人民艰苦奋斗精神。在发展商品经济中，县区各级领导上山下田，对一些新技术、新措施，带头示范、推广。
    1981年，合川遭受百年不遇的大洪灾，整个县城被吞没，59个乡被淹，当年全县粮食总产仍比上年增产3500万公斤；今年先洪后旱，灾情超过1981年，勤劳、勇敢的合川人民提出了确保全年增产计划不减少的目标。他们靠的是对党的坚强信念和不屈不挠的艰苦斗争精神。
    8月9日，我们在沙溪乡南溪村，见到村党支部书记张官云。他说，这个村人均只有0.67亩耕地，过去不少人流浪他乡。如今，靠党的政策，靠勤劳的双手，成了人均千斤果、千元钱、千斤粮的富裕村。南溪村在合川县算不上最冒尖的村，它仅是数以百计乡村中的一个。1940年，周恩来和邓颖超同志曾到合川县育才学校，给师生讲述了社会主义社会的美好前景。如今，这个美景正逐渐成为现实。（文贤书）
