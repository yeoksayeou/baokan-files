Premier Li Peng met with the departing Portuguese Ambassador Valerio this afternoon in Zhongnanhai.

Li Peng expressed his gratitude to the Ambassador for his efforts in promoting friendly relations between China and Portugal and in resolving the issue of Macau during his tenure in China.

Li Peng stated that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Portugal, the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries have continued to develop. Due to the joint efforts of both sides, the friendly relations and the implementation of the joint declaration on the issue of Macau have not been affected by the recent turmoil in Beijing. The meetings of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group on Macau have proceeded as usual, and we are pleased about this.

Li Peng said that the world is vast, and various events occur frequently. We believe that the overall trend in the international situation is moving from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue. Based on this fundamental analysis, we continue to implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy, which will not change due to temporary events. We are willing to maintain and develop relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to develop friendly relations with Portugal, and to continue close cooperation with the Portuguese side to implement the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on Macau and to maintain the stability and prosperity of Macau.

Li Peng requested that the Ambassador convey his greetings to the President and Prime Minister of Portugal upon his return to his country.

Ambassador Valerio said that through dialogue and negotiations, China and Portugal have successfully resolved the difficult issue of Macau and achieved the goals of stability and development in Macau. In this regard, Portugal has received full and close cooperation from the Chinese side. During the process of resolving the Macau issue and implementing the joint declaration, the Portuguese side has always felt the sincerity of the Chinese side. The close cooperation between the two sides in strictly implementing the joint declaration is a vivid embodiment of the friendly cooperative relations between China and Portugal.

The Ambassador said that world peace needs a stable China. He conveyed the good wishes of the Portuguese government and people to the Chinese government and people, wishing China stability and development.

    李鹏会见葡离任大使
    重申我外交政策不因一时一事而改变
    愿同葡方发展友好关系解决澳门问题
    新华社北京八月十八日电　国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海会见了即将离任的葡萄牙大使瓦莱里奥。
    李鹏对大使在华任职期间为发展中葡两国友好关系和解决澳门问题所做的努力表示感谢。
    李鹏说，中葡建交以来，两国友好合作关系不断得到发展。由于双方的共同努力，两国友好关系和贯彻执行关于澳门问题的联合声明的工作并没有因为不久前在北京发生的暴乱而受到影响。中葡关于澳门问题的联合联络小组的会议照常进行，我们对此感到欣慰。
    李鹏说，世界是如此之大，经常发生这样或那样的事件。我们认为总的国际形势的特点仍然是从紧张走向缓和，从对抗走向对话。正是根据这样的基本分析，我们继续执行独立自主的和平外交政策，这一政策不会因为一时一事而改变。我们愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上同世界各国保持和发展关系，同葡萄牙发展友好关系，并为贯彻中葡关于澳门问题的联合声明和保持澳门的稳定与繁荣而继续同葡方进行密切的合作。
    李鹏请大使回国后转达杨尚昆主席和他本人对葡萄牙总统和总理的问候。
    瓦莱里奥大使说，葡中双方通过对话与谈判很好地解决了澳门这个困难问题，通过双方的共同努力达到了澳门稳定和发展的目标。在这方面，葡萄牙得到了中方的充分和密切的合作。在解决澳门问题和执行联合声明的过程中，葡方一直感受到了中方的诚意。双方就严格贯彻联合声明进行密切合作，是中葡两国友好合作关系的生动体现。
    大使说，世界和平需要中国的稳定。他转达了葡萄牙政府和人民对中国政府和人民的良好祝愿，祝中国稳定和发展。
