Facing the severe challenges from Japan and Western Europe, U.S. high-tech companies have shifted their business strategy from competition to "strategic alliances."

The most typical example is the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which in June of this year, along with six other electronic computer and semiconductor companies, established a large joint venture specializing in the production of semiconductor chips—the American Memory Chip Company. Statistics show that since Congress relaxed the "Anti-Trust Law" in 1984, the United States has established over 100 similar large joint ventures. Related to this, U.S. high-tech companies in recent years have also strengthened their ties and cooperation with university professors and researchers. The Wall Street Journal referred to this as "strategic alliances."

Previously, U.S. high-tech companies competed with foreign rivals largely on their own, but now they have formed a united front to face external competition. From a macro perspective, Japan and Western Europe have made significant strides in the high-tech field in recent years, challenging the U.S.'s monopoly position. Certain high-tech products have even been surpassed by those from Japan and Western Europe. Experience has shown that the level of technological, especially high-tech, development is crucial to a country's economic prosperity. Therefore, many experts warn: if high-tech companies do not change their strategies, the U.S. may lose more ground in the tech sector, ultimately becoming a "second-tier economic power." Under these circumstances, U.S. high-tech companies have realized that only by uniting can they counter external competition and continue to maintain their global leadership. From a micro perspective, there are three main factors: first, the high cost, complexity, and risk of developing new technologies make it difficult for a single company to succeed; second, the internationalization of the market forces large companies to seek partners to help them enter overseas markets; third, a large number of foreign high-tech companies with strong human and financial resources and competitive strength have emerged, prompting U.S. companies to change their business strategies.

This new business strategy is borrowed from Japan and Western Europe. For example, in the late 1970s, Japan used joint ventures to dominate the global semiconductor market. Recently, 15 Japanese companies established a joint venture to produce large-screen high-definition television sets, aiming to compete with the U.S. for this vast potential market. As for the European Community, there are even more such joint ventures. The European Space Agency and Airbus are two examples. Just two days before the announcement of the establishment of the American Memory Chip Company, the European Community had already approved a $4 billion joint venture to produce chips. Undoubtedly, with the establishment of a unified internal market in Western Europe, this trend will further develop and strengthen.

The experiences of Japan and Western Europe show that establishing large high-tech joint ventures has many advantages. First, it can organize the technological elite of member companies to tackle key problems. Second, it helps avoid the duplication of research and waste of funds caused by individual efforts. Third, it reduces risk. Fourth, it lowers research costs, making research results internationally competitive in price. Fifth, new inventions can be quickly transformed into productive forces. It is these advantages that drive U.S. high-tech companies to emulate Western Europe and Japan, establishing large high-tech joint ventures.

So far, the large joint ventures established in the United States have been concentrated in the high-tech industry and have been limited to research projects because the U.S. "Anti-Trust Law" prohibits the establishment of giant joint production enterprises. However, if the American Memory Chip Company gains approval from relevant departments, a large number of joint production enterprises will emerge. Therefore, some people are concerned that the United States may once again see a few large enterprises monopolizing the market, causing harm to small and medium-sized enterprises.

Regarding the strategic shift of high-tech companies, the U.S. government holds an encouraging and approving attitude. The Secretary of Commerce recently stated that the establishment of the chip company is a "creative response" to the changing international market situation. On Capitol Hill, some congressmen have proposed bills to amend the "Anti-Trust Law" to pave the way for the establishment of large joint production enterprises. However, some experts point out that due to different specific situations, strategies that work in Western Europe and Japan may not necessarily be suitable for the United States. Despite differing opinions, the new development strategy of the U.S. high-tech industry is an inevitable trend.

    美国高技术工业改变经营战略
    本报记者　张亮
    面对日本和西欧的严重挑战，美国高技术公司的经营战略由竞争对手变为“战略性结合”。
    最典型的一个例子是国际商业机器公司，它今年6月间与另外6家电子计算机和半导体公司成立一个专门生产半导体芯片的大型联合公司——美国存储芯片公司。据统计，自1984年国会松动“反托拉斯法”以来，美国已组建100多个类似的大型联合企业。与此相关的是，美国高技术公司近年来还进一步加强了与大学教授和科研人员的联系及合作。华尔街日报称之为“战略性结合”。
    以往，美国高技术公司在与国外对手竞争中基本上是“孤军作战”，而如今则结成了同舟共济、一致对外的“统一阵线”。从宏观上来说，近年来日本和西欧在高技术领域奋起直追，美国的垄断地位随之发生动摇，某些高技术产品甚至已让位于日本和西欧。实践证明，科技特别是高技术发展水平的高低乃是一国经济兴衰之关键。因此，不少人士惊呼：如果高技术公司不“改弦易辙”，美国有可能在科技领域丧失更多的“地盘”，以致最终沦为“二等经济大国”。在此情势下，美国的高技术公司已认识到，只有联合起来才能对付外部竞争，进而继续保持其世界领先地位。从微观角度来看，其主要因素有三点，一是开发新技术费用高、复杂、风险大，
  “单枪匹马”显然力不从心；二是市场国际化迫使大公司寻求合作伙伴，以帮助它们打开海外市场；三是一大批人力和财力雄厚、竞争力强的外国高技术公司纷纷出笼，促使美国公司改变其经营战略。
    这种新的经营战略是从日本和西欧搬来的。譬如，在70年代末日本就是靠联合手段垄断了世界半导体市场。不久前，日本15家公司又建立了一个生产大屏幕高清晰度电视机的联合企业，其目标是与美国争夺这一巨大的潜在市场。至于欧共体，类似的联合企业更多，欧洲航天局和空中客车公司便是其中的两个。就在美国存储芯片公司宣告成立的前两天，欧共体已宣布批准一项耗资40亿美元联合生产芯片的大型项目。毫无疑问，随着西欧内部统一大市场的建立，这一趋势将会进一步发展和加强。
    日本和西欧的经验表明，组建大型高技术联合企业具有多种优势。首先，可以组织各成员公司的科技精英进行攻关。其次，有助于避免各自为战所造成的研究重叠和资金浪费现象。第三，风险小。第四，可降低研究成本，从而使其研究成果在价格上具有国际竞争能力。第五，新的发明创造能尽快转化为生产力。正是这些优势驱使美国高技术公司仿效西欧和日本，纷纷成立大型高科技联合企业。
    美国迄今成立的大型联合企业都集中在高技术工业，而且仅限于研究项目，因为美国的“反托拉斯法”禁止组建巨型联合生产企业。但是，如果美国存储芯片公司获得有关部门的认可，大批联合生产企业就会纷纷出现。因此，有人担心美国会再度出现由少数大企业垄断市场的局面，使中小企业遭受打击。
    对于高技术公司的这一战略转变，美国政府持鼓励和赞赏态度。商务部长最近声称，成立芯片公司是针对变化中的国际市场状况作出的一种“具有创造性的反应”。在国会山，有的议员已提出议案，要求修正“反托拉斯法”，为成立大型联合生产企业开绿灯。但也有专家指出，由于各自的具体情况不同，在西欧和日本行之有效的战略并不一定就适用于美国。尽管人们意见不一，美国高技术工业的这一新的发展战略已是大势所趋。
