    Huainan Busts Major Coal Smuggling Case
    Our reporter from Hefei reports: Recently, the public security authorities in Huainan, Anhui, have overcome numerous obstacles to crack a major coal smuggling case, unprecedented since the founding of the nation. It has been ascertained that this group has smuggled 239,000 tons of coal, earning illicit gains of 5.02 million yuan.

    The deputy director of the planning department of Huainan Power Plant, Zhu Miaoqing, the director of the transportation division, Li Fenju, and speculators from the labor service company of Ding County Power Supply Bureau, Liu'an County Power Supply Bureau, and the fuel company of Fuyang Region, have colluded internally and externally. They have taken advantage of their authority and business opportunities to engage in illegal coal trading through various means such as "price conversion," "contract conversion," and mixing a large amount of coal gangue into coal. This has severely harmed the state and users. This group of "coal rats" has committed 115 crimes, with 18 individuals earning over 100,000 yuan in illicit gains, the highest being 560,000 yuan. The entire case involves 6 provinces, 15 cities and regions, 120 units, and 109 individuals, including 57 party members and officials, and 12 officials at the section level or above. The Huainan Municipal Procuratorate has arrested 6 individuals, given 3 individuals re-education through labor, given administrative penalties to 4 individuals, and recommended disciplinary actions for 96 individuals. The authorities have recovered 4.05 million yuan in illicit gains and property.
