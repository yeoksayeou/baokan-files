As China's policy of opening up to the outside world expands from the coastal regions to the interior, it is also rapidly extending from south to north. The three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, along with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are fully utilizing their resource and geographical advantages, opening up both to the south and the north, and creating a new pattern of multi-directional openness.

During a visit to the Northeast, the reporter learned that in recent years, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as some of their cities, have promoted economic and technological cooperation with Japan, Europe, America, and Southeast Asian countries through sending delegations abroad, establishing sister cities with foreign cities, and exchanging representative offices with overseas trading companies. This has also driven trade and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, North Korea, Mongolia, and Eastern European countries. Since last year, this multi-directional opening approach has entered a new stage of contract signing and transactions in many cooperation areas. Statistics show that the total export value of the three provinces and one region in the first half of this year has exceeded 300 million US dollars. The fastest-growing exports are from Jilin and Liaoning, both of which have increased by more than 13% compared to the same period last year. Inner Mongolia's border trade with the Soviet Union last year reached over 130 million Swiss francs, an increase of 80% compared to the previous year. In the first five months of this year, Heilongjiang has signed import and export trade contracts with the Soviet Union worth nearly 600 million Swiss francs, an increase of three times compared to the same period last year. The variety of export products has also increased from a few dozen to over 4,000.

It is worth noting that the opening up of the three provinces and one region has extended to multiple forms and areas, including attracting foreign investment, developing import and export trade, processing with supplied materials, technological exchanges, engineering contracts, and labor cooperation. In recent years, the three provinces and one region have proposed over 500 economic and technological cooperation projects covering more than 10 industries. In addition to opening up the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone, the Yingkou Bayuquan Export Processing Zone, and the Shenyang Tiexi Industrial Zone as pilot areas, they have also focused on utilizing foreign investment in the Sanjiang Plain, comprehensive development and utilization of Daqing petrochemical products, renovation of old enterprises, and production and processing of agricultural and sideline products and daily consumer goods.

The extensive cooperation has attracted a large number of foreign businessmen. By the end of 1988, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang had approved the establishment of over 660 joint ventures and cooperative enterprises. Although there have been serious disruptions this year, the number of cooperation projects signed is still higher than the same period last year.

The previously isolated three provinces and one region now have both southern and northern doors open. In addition to Dalian developing into the largest trade center in the Northeast, new ports such as Changlingzi and Hulin have been opened to the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Eastern European countries. After the opening of the Liaodong Peninsula, new ports such as Dandong Dandong Port and Yingkou Bayuquan Port have also been opened. Meanwhile, the three provinces and one region have further improved the investment environment. Ports, airports, railways, highways, and communication facilities have been strengthened. The largest airport in the Northeast, Shenyang Taoxian Airport, and the high-speed road from Shenyang to Dalian have both been put into use, promoting the pattern of multi-port trade in the south and north. Currently, this region has developed economic and technological cooperation relations with more than 100 countries and regions around the world. With a series of preferential policies and significant progress in environmental construction, the three provinces and one region are becoming increasingly attractive to businessmen from various countries.

    充分发挥资源和地理优势
    黑吉辽蒙多方位对外开放
    三省一区上半年出口贸易额逾30亿美元
    本报讯　记者陆振华报道：我国对外开放由沿海向内地逐渐扩大的同时，迅速由南向北不断扩展，东北三省和内蒙古充分发挥资源和地理优势，南北两头敞开大门，出现了多方位开放的新格局。
    记者在东北地区采访时了解到，近几年来，辽宁、吉林、黑龙江和内蒙古三省一区及其一些城市，通过派代表团出访、和国外城市建立友好城市以及同海外商社互派代表机构等形式，不仅促进了和日本、欧美、东南亚各国的经济技术合作，还推动了与苏联、朝鲜、蒙古和东欧各国的贸易和经济合作。去年以来，这种多方位开放方式在许多合作领域已由过去考察探索进入成交签约的新阶段。据统计，今年上半年三省一区出口总额已逾30亿美元，增长最快的是吉林和辽宁，都比去年同期增长13％以上。内蒙古去年对苏边境贸易额已达1.3亿多瑞士法郎，比前年增加80％。黑龙江今年头5个月已与苏联签订进出口贸易近6亿瑞士法郎，比去年同期增长3倍，出口品种也由过去的几十种发展到4000多种。
    值得注意的是，三省一区开放已向引进外资、发展进出口贸易、来料加工、科技交流、工程承包、劳务合作等多形式多领域延伸发展。近几年三省一区已拟出包括10多个行业的500多个经济技术合作项目；除开辟大连经济技术开发区营口鲅鱼圈出口加工区和沈阳铁西工业区等开放先行区外，还把三江平原、大庆石油化工产品综合开发利用、老企业改造和农副产品、日用消费产品生产加工作为利用外资的重点。
    广泛的合作吸引了大量外国厂商。到1988年底，辽、吉、黑三省已批准兴办合资、合作企业660多家，今年以来虽受到严重干扰，但签订的合作项目仍比上年同期增加。
    过去闭塞的三省一区，现在南北大门都已打开。除大连发展成东北最大的贸易中心外，对苏、蒙、东欧国家，还相继开放了长岭子、虎林等一些新的口岸，在辽东半岛开放后又新开放丹东大东港、营口鲅鱼圈港。与此同时，三省一区进一步改善了投资环境，港口、机场、铁路、公路、通讯设施得到了加强，东北最大的沈阳桃仙机场和沈阳至大连的高速公路南北两段都已开通使用，促进了南北多口通商的格局。目前这里已和世界100多个国家和地区发展了经济技术合作关系。在一系列优惠政策和环境建设取得明显进展的情况下，三省一区对各国厂商的吸引力越来越大。
