In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, Shaanxi's scientific and technological undertakings have made significant progress. In 1949, Shaanxi had fewer than 10,000 science and technology personnel, only 3 research institutions, and just 3 institutions of higher learning. After 40 years, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the province's scientific and technological sector has taken on a new look. There are now 502 research institutions and over 560,000 science and technology personnel. The proportion of science and technology personnel in state-owned enterprises is 11.1%, second only to Beijing and the highest in the country. The number of institutions of higher learning has grown to 50 (excluding military academies). The Yangling District, with its complete range of disciplines, matching specialties, and numerous institutions, has become China's only modern agricultural science city. The defense industry has a strong scientific and technological force, serving as a crucial support for the development of the local economy. Between 1979 and 1988, the province achieved 4,068 major scientific and technological achievements, accounting for 55.5% of the total 7,331 achievements since the founding of the People's Republic. Among these, 33 were international firsts, and 193 reached international advanced levels. Incomplete statistics show that since 1981, the 939 achievements awarded by the provincial government alone have generated over 2.5 billion yuan in economic benefits.

The provincial Party Committee and government proposed the strategic policy of "Education as the Foundation, Science and Technology to Revitalize Shaanxi" in April 1988, and by the end of the year, they formulated the "Outline for Revitalizing Shaanxi through Science and Technology," setting long-term, medium-term, and short-term goals. In the short term (1988-1992), the plan is to mobilize and organize 50,000 science and technology personnel to enter the front lines of agricultural and industrial production, taking on 10,000 product and technology development projects and 20 million mu of planting. By 1992, the goal is to achieve an additional 5 billion yuan in output value and 1 billion yuan in taxes.

    教育奠基  科技兴陕
    本报讯　建国40年来，陕西的科学技术事业有了很大发展。
    1949年，陕西的科技人员不足万人，从事科研的机构只有3个，高等院校只有3所。经过40年特别是十一届三中全会以来的发展，全省的科技事业出现了崭新局面。现有各种科研机构502个，科技人员达到56万多人。全省全民所有制单位科技人员占职工总数的11.1％，仅次于北京，居全国第二位。高等院校也发展到50所（不含军事院校）。学科齐全、专业配套、机构众多的杨陵区，已成为我国唯一的现代化农业科学城。国防工业科技力量实力雄厚，是地方经济发展的一支重要依靠力量。1979—1988年全省共取得重要科技成果4068项，占建国以来成果总数7331项的55.5％。其中，属于国际首创的33项，达到国际先进水平的193项。据不完全统计，1981年以来，仅受省政府奖励的939项成果，已取得了25亿多元的经济效益。
    省委和省政府于1988年4月提出了“教育奠基，科技兴陕”的战略方针，年底又制定了《科技兴陕纲要》，确定了长期、中期和近期3个阶段的奋斗目标。在近期（1988—1992年）内，要动员组织5万名科技人员进入工农业生产第一线，承包1万个产品、技术开发项目和2000万亩种植业。到1992年，实现新增产值50亿元、利税10亿元。
