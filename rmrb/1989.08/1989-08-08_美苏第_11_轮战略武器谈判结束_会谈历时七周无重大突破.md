Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, August 7th.

The 11th round of US-Soviet strategic nuclear weapons talks, which lasted seven weeks, concluded on August 7th without significant progress. The talks were held in secret and involved intense negotiations.

At a press conference on the afternoon of August 7th, the chief US negotiator, Bert, admitted that the round of talks "did not achieve any major breakthroughs." However, he noted that some "small but meaningful" progress had been made.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Nazarkin, told reporters that both sides had exchanged drafts of the verification protocols and the strategic nuclear weapons treaty. He pointed out that the "negotiation atmosphere was very serious, constructive, and full of hope."

Nazarkin added that due to the complexity of the issues involved in the strategic nuclear weapons reduction talks, it is currently difficult to predict when an agreement can be reached.

The next round of US-Soviet strategic weapons talks will be held in Geneva on September 25th.

    美苏第11轮战略武器谈判结束
    会谈历时七周无重大突破
    据新华社日内瓦8月7日电　美苏第11轮战略核武器会谈经过7周的秘密讨价还价，在没有取得重大进展的情况下于7日结束。
    美国首席谈判代表伯特在7日下午的记者招待会上承认，这轮会谈“没有取得重大突破”。但他指出，谈判还是取得了一些“小的、但是有意义的”进展。
    参加这轮谈判的苏联代表团团长纳扎尔金对记者说，双方交换了关于核查的议定书和战略核武器条约草案的谈判文本。他指出，“谈判的气氛是非常认真的、建设性的和很有希望的”。
    纳扎尔金补充说，由于削减战略核武器谈判问题错综复杂，目前尚难预料何时能达成协议。
    下一轮美苏战略武器谈判将于9月25日在日内瓦举行。
