The General Administration of Customs has issued new regulations to encourage individuals both within and outside the country to report cases of violations of customs laws and to combat smuggling. Recently, Customs Commissioner Dai Jie signed the "Measures for Rewarding Individuals Who Report or Assist in the Detection of Customs Law Violations."

Compared to previous reward measures, the new "Measures" expand the scope of rewards to include cases of underreporting or concealing the taxable value of goods to evade taxes. The reward limit has also been increased. For reporters, Customs will award a reward within 10% of the actual value of the seized smuggled goods, with a maximum of 100,000 yuan. For cases involving the recovery of tax revenues and economic losses, Customs will award a reward within 3% of the total amount of back taxes and fines; for cases involving only fines, the reward will be within 3% of the fine amount. For reporters residing abroad, part or all of the reward can be paid in foreign currency. Customs will strictly keep confidential the identities of individuals and units that report or assist in the detection of smuggling cases.

The new "Measures" will come into effect on September 1, 2023, and will repeal the "Measures for Rewarding the Seizure of Smugglers" issued by the General Administration of Customs on January 15, 1985.

    海关总署作新规定
    检举走私有奖
    本报北京8月25日讯　记者梅洪如报道：为鼓励境内外人员检举违反海关法案件，同走私犯罪作斗争，海关总署署长戴杰最近签发《中华人民共和国海关对检举或协助查获违反海关法案件有功人员奖励办法》。
    与以往的奖励办法比较，新的《奖励办法》扩大了奖励范围，将检举低报或瞒报完税价格的偷逃税案件也包括在奖励范围之内，同时提高了奖励限额。对检举人，海关在实际查获私货变价收入的10％以内发给奖励金，最高不超过人民币10万元。属于补征税款挽回国家经济损失的案件，海关在补税和罚款总额的3％以内给检举人发奖励金；仅作罚款处罚的案件，则在罚款额的3％以内发给奖励金。对于居住在境外的获奖检举人，其奖励金部分或全部发给外币。海关将为检举和协助查获走私案件的个人和单位严格保密。
    新《奖励办法》将于9月1日开始实施，同时废止海关总署1985年1月15日公布的《中华人民共和国海关奖励缉私办法》。
