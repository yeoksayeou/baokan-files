Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, August 13th.

The Cuban troops stationed in Angola on August 11th withdrew nearly 400 pieces of heavy weaponry from the port of Namibe in southwestern Angola. These weapons were originally deployed in southern Angola's Cunene and Cuando Cubango provinces and were shipped back to Cuba by sea.

According to the Angolan National News Agency, the weapons included tanks, missile launchers, artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and various vehicles.

The withdrawal of these military equipment is in accordance with the agreement signed by Angola and Cuba in New York in December 1988 regarding the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The head of the UN inspection team in Angola, Brazilian Brigadier General Ferreira Gomes, led the team to supervise the withdrawal at the port of Namibe.

According to reports, General Gomes expressed satisfaction with the implementation of the New York agreement by both Angola and Cuba. The Cuban side announced that since the start of the withdrawal on January 10th of this year, Cuba has withdrawn 12,000 troops from Angola.

    联合国核查团现场监督
    古巴从安撤走重型军械
    新华社罗安达8月13日电　驻安哥拉的古巴军队11日从安哥拉西南部纳米贝市港口，把原部署在安南部库内内省和宽多库邦戈省的近400件重型武器装备经海运回国。
    据安哥拉国家通讯社报道，这些武器装备包括坦克、导弹发射器、大炮、防空火炮及各种汽车。
    运回这些军事装备是执行安、古1988年12月在纽约签署的关于古巴从安哥拉撤军的协议。联合国驻安哥拉核查团团长、巴西准将费雷拉·戈麦斯率领核查团在纳米贝港监督撤运工作。
    据报道，戈麦斯将军对安、古双方执行纽约协议的情况表示满意。据古巴方面宣布，自今年1月10日开始撤军以来，古巴已从安哥拉撤军1.2万人。
