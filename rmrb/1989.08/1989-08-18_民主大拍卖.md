New York City is gearing up for a new mayoral election. The competition for this position is likely to be second only to the race for the U.S. presidency, as New York is the nation's largest city with an annual budget of $26.6 billion. Therefore, both the Democratic and Republican parties are eagerly preparing for the mid-August primaries.

Elections have always been a source of pride for Americans as a demonstration of democracy. However, this American-style democracy is increasingly becoming a high-stakes, money-driven contest. The total election expenses for last year's presidential race, as well as for congressional and gubernatorial elections, reportedly exceeded $2 billion. This year's New York mayoral election is expected to break all records in terms of campaign spending.

The Republican Party is aiming to reclaim the mayoral seat they lost 20 years ago. Ronald Lauder, a cosmetics magnate and former ambassador to Austria, is likely to be the party's nominee, primarily because he is willing to invest heavily. So far, he has spent $8.5 million on promotional expenses for the nomination and has vowed to spend up to $20 million to ensure victory. This is nearly double the $7 million that the incumbent mayor, Koch, spent on his re-election campaign four years ago.

Republican voters in New York City are not particularly interested in Lauder's policy platform but are impressed by his lavish spending. A report in the *Christian Science Monitor* states: "People feel this is a democratic auction." The report also quotes a political observer as saying, "To make your name known among 400,000 Republican voters by spending $8 million or $9 million, even Donald Duck could be nominated as a candidate."

    民主大拍卖
    纽约市要选举新市长了。争夺这个职位的激烈程度大概将仅次于竞选美国总统，因为纽约是全国最大的都市，每年财政收支高达266亿美元，所以民主与共和两党都在摩拳擦掌准备下月中旬的提名初选。
    选举活动向来是美国引以自豪的民主表现形式，然而这种美式民主越来越成为赌博性的花钱大比赛。去年的总统大选以及国会议员和州长的竞选，参赛者所耗的竞选费用据说总数已超过20亿美元。这次纽约市长的竞选经费估计要打破纪录。
    共和党力图夺回已失去20年的纽约市长宝座。曾任驻奥地利大使的化妆品巨商罗纳德·劳德很可能被提名为该党候选人，主要原因是他舍得下大“赌注”。迄今他已经支出竞选提名的宣传费850万美元，并宣称不惜破费两千万务求必胜。这就比现任市长柯克4年前竞选连任所费的700万美元多出近两倍。
    纽约市的共和党选民对劳德所宣传的施政纲领并无多大兴趣，而对他的挥金豪举却印象深刻。《基督教科学箴言报》的一篇报道说：“人们觉得这简直是民主大拍卖”。该报还引述一位政治观察家的话说，为了使自己的名字家喻户晓，在40万共和党选民身上抛洒800万或900万美元，“连唐老鸭也可以被提名为候选人”。
