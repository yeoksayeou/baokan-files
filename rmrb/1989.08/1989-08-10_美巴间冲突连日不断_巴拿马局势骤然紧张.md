U.S.-Panama Conflict Escalates, Panamanian Situation Tense

Our reporter Zhu Manting reports from Caracas: The U.S. military stationed in the Panama Canal Zone has been creating disturbances over the past two days, leading to a sudden escalation in tensions in Panama, drawing international attention.

On the 8th, U.S. soldiers suddenly disarmed and detained seven active-duty Panamanian soldiers for three hours, marking the most serious conflict between the two countries' militaries in recent years. Yesterday, the situation worsened. A spokesperson for the Panamanian Defense Forces stated that military vehicles and soldiers from the U.S. Southern Command had sealed off the Amador Fortress, a military area jointly guarded by both countries. Ronald Skonnes, the public relations director of the U.S. Southern Command, claimed that the U.S. military took this action because the Panamanian military had detained two U.S. military police officers earlier that morning. One officer was arrested near the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, and the other was detained while negotiating the issue at the Amador Fortress. Consequently, the U.S. military also arrested two Panamanian military police officers at the checkpoint of the Amador Fortress. The U.S. military's blockade lasted approximately three hours.

During this time, the Panamanian Defense Forces ordered all national troops to be on high alert. Armed U.S. Marine Corps personnel and Panamanian Defense Forces who came to reinforce faced off against each other. Panamanian militias also gathered around the military area, waving national flags and chanting "Yankees go home." Meanwhile, anti-U.S. incidents occurred in the capital, Panama City, and other locations. Both sides were in a serious standoff, on the brink of a larger conflict.

After several hours of negotiations, the detained personnel from both sides were released yesterday afternoon. Although a larger conflict was avoided, the situation in Panama remains tense.

The Amador Fortress is located in the suburbs of Panama City. The joint command headquarters for Panama-U.S. canal defense and security is located in this area, and the office of Panama's top military leader, General Noriega, is also situated here.

    美巴间冲突连日不断  巴拿马局势骤然紧张
    本报加拉加斯8月10日电　记者朱满庭报道：驻守巴拿马运河区的美国军队近两日不断制造事端，巴拿马局势随之骤然紧张，引起国际社会关注。
    8日，美军士兵突然将7名巴拿马现役军人解除武装并扣押3小时，成为两国军队近几年中最严重的冲突事件。昨天，事态进一步发展，巴拿马国防军发言人说，美国南方司令部所属的军车和士兵封锁了由两国部队共同驻守的阿马多尔堡军事地区。美国南方司令部公关处主任罗纳德·斯孔叶斯声称，美军采取这一行动是因为巴拿马军方上午扣押了两名美国军事警察，一名军警在巴拿马国防军大本营附近被捕，另一名是在去阿马多尔堡军事地区交涉此事时被扣。因此美军也在阿马多尔堡军事地区入口处的岗亭逮捕了两名巴拿马军事警察。据报道，美军的封锁行动大约持续3小时。
    其间，巴拿马国防军曾命令全国所有官兵进入戒备状态。荷枪实弹的美国海军陆战队队员与前来增援的巴拿马国防军官兵怒目相视。巴拿马民兵也高举国旗，聚集到该军事地区周围，高呼“美国佬滚回去”的口号。同时，首都巴拿马城和其它地方也发生了反美事件。巴美双方处于严重对峙状态，大有一触即发之势。
    经过几小时的谈判交涉，昨天下午双方被捕人员都已获释。虽然避免了一场更大的冲突，但是巴拿马局势仍处于紧张状态。
    阿马多尔堡军事地区位于巴拿马城郊区，巴美运河防卫和安全联合指挥部巴方办公室设在这个区内，巴军方最高领导人诺列加将军在这里也设有办公室。
