People's Daily, Chengdu – Reporter Lu Maocheng reports: Shaxian County in Sichuan Province adheres to the principle of "first ensuring food security, then promoting development." In the construction of the Fuchuan Hydropower and Navigation Project, the county has balanced land acquisition with land reclamation, ensuring that construction land and reclaimed farmland complement each other. This approach has paved a new way for the project's rational land use.

Shaxian County is located in the middle reaches of the Fuchuan River. With an average of only 0.7 acres of arable land per person, the county faces severe land shortages. Additionally, the lack of energy and poor transportation infrastructure have significantly hindered the development of agriculture and industry. To boost production capacity, Shaxian County decided to invest 130 million yuan to build a comprehensive hydropower and navigation project at the Luosipu section of the Fuchuan River. The project will have a generating capacity of 31,500 kilowatts and produce 180 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Upon completion, the project will add over 700 million yuan to the county's social output value, generate over 100 million yuan in taxes, alleviate local power shortages, and improve river navigation.

According to the design, the project will occupy and submerge 1,023 acres of arable land, affecting some farmers who rely on this land for their livelihood. The question arose: should the project prioritize one over the other, leading to the loss of arable land for construction, or should it balance both needs? The county committee and government invited experts to discuss and decided to reclaim and construct land in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoir, which have wide river terraces.

They adopted a combination of professional and community reclamation methods, using excavated soil and stone materials from the project to fill and raise previously eroded farmland. The goal is to reclaim over 1,400 acres within a year, aiming to offset the land used for construction and have surplus reclaimed land.

    既保“吃饭”  又保建设
    射洪电航工程占地造地互补
    本报成都电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省射洪县坚持“一要吃饭，二要建设”的原则，在修建涪江电航工程中占地又造地，使建设用地和垦复耕地互补有余，为工程合理用地创出了一条新路。
    射洪县地处涪江中游，人均占有耕地只0.7亩。由于耕地严重不足，加上能源缺乏，交通不畅，严重制约全县工农业生产的发展。为增强生产发展后劲，射洪县决定自筹资金1.3亿元，在涪江螺丝池处修建具备发电、航运、灌溉、防洪和旅游等多种效益的电航工程，装机容量3.15万千瓦，年发电1.8亿度。建成投产后，该县每年可增加社会产值7亿多元，创税利上亿元，并可缓解当地电力供应紧张状况，改善涪江航运。
    根据设计，这个工程的建设要占用和淹没耕地1023亩，部分农民将失去赖以生存的土地。是顾此失彼、一兴一废，大量占用和淹没耕地来保工程建设，还是统筹兼顾、两业俱兴呢？县委、县政府专门请有关专家论证，决定在修建工程的同时，在库区上下游的4块宽阔的河滩地上垦复造地。
    他们采用专业垦复和群众垦复相结合的办法，用开挖工程的废弃土石料，填低垫高过去被冲毁的耕地，计划一年内垦复1400余亩，争取实现建设占地与垦复耕地相抵并有多余。
