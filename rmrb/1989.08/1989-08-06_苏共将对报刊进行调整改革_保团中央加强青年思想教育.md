Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th

The CPSU Central Committee recently passed a resolution to reform the party's central newspapers and publications.

The resolution, released by TASS on August 5th, states that the Soviet news media has played an active role in revitalizing society, but the media itself also needs to be improved and reformed to meet the party's requirements.

For some time, there have been differing opinions within the CPSU on editorial policies. Some advocate boldly exposing problems and publishing various "objective" reports; others believe that publishing articles that expose the dark side without analysis will have a negative impact on society.

The CPSU Central Committee's resolution criticizes the former view. The resolution states that some newspapers and publications sometimes misunderstand their role in implementing political and economic reforms, limiting themselves to exposing flaws in this or that area, rather than conducting in-depth analysis and mobilizing various social forces to solve urgent problems in the reform.

The CPSU Central Committee also decided to restructure some newspapers and publications. For example, _Socialist Industry News_ and _Construction News_ will be merged into the CPSU Central Committee's newspaper _Worker's Forum_ starting in 1990; starting in 1990, the CPSU Central Committee will launch a social and political publication _Dialogue_, while discontinuing the CPSU Central Committee's publications _Agitator_ and _Political Education_.

According to a report from BTA, the Dimitrov Communist Youth League of Bulgaria held its third Central Committee plenary session on August 4th. The resolution passed at the session states that, in the new revolutionary changes, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political education for youth. It is necessary to mobilize youth in all fields to actively and unwaveringly participate in the reform. The ideological and political education work for youth organizations includes educating youth in patriotism, communism, and love for labor. The current specific task is to actively participate in voluntary labor teams, ensuring the timely completion and overfulfillment of this year's production plan.

Bulgarian Communist Party Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Stoyanov said in his speech at the meeting that, to consolidate the youth organization and better complete various tasks, the youth organization itself must deepen the reform.

### 苏共将对报刊进行调整改革  保团中央加强青年思想教育

    苏共将对报刊进行调整改革  保团中央加强青年思想教育
    新华社莫斯科8月5日电  苏共中央最近通过一项决定，对党的中央报纸和刊物进行改革。
    由塔斯社5日发表的这项决定认为，苏联新闻媒介为复兴社会起着积极作用，但新闻媒介本身也需要完善和改革，以符合党所提出的要求。
    一个时期以来，苏共内部对办报方针存在不同看法，有的主张大胆揭露问题，刊登各种“客观”报道；有的则认为不加分析地登载暴露阴暗面的文章，会对社会产生消极影响。
    苏共中央的决定对前一种意见提出了批评。决定说，某些报纸和刊物有时片面理解自己在实施政治和经济改革中的作用，局限于揭露这方面或那方面的缺点，而未着力进行深入的分析和调动社会各种力量去解决改革中的迫切问题。
    苏共中央还决定对某些报刊进行结构调整。如将《社会主义工业报》和《建筑报》从1990年起合并为苏共中央日报《工人论坛》；从1990年开始创办苏共中央的社会政治刊物《对话》，同时取消苏共中央刊物《鼓动员》和《政治教育》。
    新华社索非亚8月4日电  据保通社报道，保加利亚季米特洛夫共产主义青年团4日举行第三届中央全会。全会通过的决议说，在新的革命变革的情况下，需要加强对青年的思想政治教育工作。动员各领域的青年毫不动摇地积极参加改革。青年组织的思想政治教育工作包括对青年进行爱国主义、共产主义和热爱劳动的教育。当前的具体任务是积极参加义务劳动队，保证按期完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。
    保共中央政治局委员、中央书记斯托扬诺夫在会上发表讲话说，为巩固青年组织更好地完成各项任务，青年组织自己也要加深改革。
