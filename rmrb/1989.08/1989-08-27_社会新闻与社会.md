Social news is the "signature dish" of local evening newspapers. How to reflect contemporary social life through reporting social news that the public enjoys, promote socialist moral standards, criticize negative social phenomena, and advocate for fair and healthy public opinion. The recently concluded National Evening Newspaper Social News Competition has conducted rich practices in this regard, leaving behind valuable experiences.

In this five-month competition, 41 evening newspapers participated in the activity, with 39 newspapers submitting entries, totaling over 2,100 social news articles. Among them, 93 news pieces won awards, 11 page layouts won layout awards, and 10 newspapers won organizational awards. This competition was a comprehensive review of social news by the national evening newspaper industry, showcasing a large number of outstanding entries, expanding the scope of socialist newspapers' reporting on social news, and to some extent enriching people's understanding of the connotations and extensions of social news.

What is social news? Previously, there was a view that social news is about reporting strange and unusual events and exposing the dark side of society, focusing on sensationalism. This is obviously a misunderstanding of how socialist newspapers should report social news.

The social news we refer to should reflect current social life, social events, social customs, and social issues, and have social educational significance. Looking at the over 2,000 entries in this National Evening Newspaper Social News Competition, the news perspective is quite broad, and the reporting topics are very rich. There are reports on new social trends that inspire people to strive forward and dedicate themselves to socialist causes, reflections on new types of relationships among people in a socialist society, exposures and criticisms of negative social phenomena, problem-oriented social news, and event-oriented social news, and so on. However, regardless of the type of topic, the reporting pays great attention to its social educational significance. It can be said that paying attention to the positive social significance of social news is an important feature that distinguishes our socialist news from bourgeois social news.

Social news should pay great attention to social educational significance, striving to advocate for positive energy, promote socialist moral standards, and promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization through typical social news. The entry from Xīn Mín Wǎn Bào, "Career, Love, Family," is a social news piece that pays attention to maintaining a high tone and has profound educational significance. This report tells the touching story of renowned female scientist Xiè Xīdé, who has been tirelessly caring for her seriously ill husband for many years. Because Xiè Xīdé is well-known, her little-known pure love story and her noble spiritual realm in family life have a unique infectious and educational effect. Although this is a story about a celebrity, it best reflects a person's character and spirit. The entry from Wǔhàn Wǎn Bào, "Blood-Stained Videotape," reports on the heroic deed of fire safety propaganda officer Chéng Jìngfā during the oil barge explosion accident in Wuhan on January 2nd. Chéng Jìngfā bravely filmed the scene, and when the barge exploded, he sacrificed his life. The videotape sank to the bottom of the river, and in the last 22 minutes, it shone with the light of the martyr's life. When people saw the videotape retrieved from the river, they were all moved to tears. He wrote a heroic epic with his life.

To resist the infiltration of decadent thoughts and eliminate various negative trends, social news should also frequently carry out newspaper criticism, expose negative social phenomena, and play a role in public supervision. For example, the social news piece from Hā'ěr Bīn Xīn Wǎn Bào, "Máo Ā Mǐn Evades Taxes by 300,000 Yuan," exposed the fact that this red singer earned 600,000 yuan in five days during her performance in Harbin during the Spring Festival and evaded 300,000 yuan in taxes, revealing a "Máo Ā Mǐn phenomenon" and sparking a strong social response. This news has profound social educational significance. It raises issues such as strict tax management, strengthening cultural market management, strengthening actor ideological education, and addressing social inequities, causing a stir across various social strata and becoming a hot topic of discussion nationwide, leaving a deep impression on people.

Problem reporting is not just about exposing the dark side of life but also about pointing out larger issues in life and preventing the occurrence and development of various negative trends. For example, the three consecutive reports from Yáng Chéng Wǎn Bào, "The Blind Tide," placed this spring's nationwide "migrant worker" problem in the context of reform and opening up, conducting multi-faceted thinking and analysis, and writing a series of reports with both narration and commentary, which are quite profound. This is the product of the reporter's strong sense of social responsibility and competitive awareness, playing a significant role in reversing the "blind flow" problem.

    社会新闻与社会

    社会新闻，是各地晚报的“特色菜”。如何通过报道群众喜闻乐见的社会新闻来反映当今社会生活，弘扬社会主义道德风范，鞭挞不良的社会现象，倡导公正健康的舆论。刚刚降下帷幕的全国晚报社会新闻大赛在这方面进行了丰富的实践，留下了可喜的经验。
    在这次历时五个月的大赛中，有41家晚报参加了活动，参赛晚报有39家，共发表参赛社会新闻稿2100多篇，其中有93篇新闻作品获奖，有11个版面获版面奖，10家晚报获组织奖。这次大赛是全国晚报界对社会新闻的一次大检阅，推出了一大批精彩纷呈的参赛作品，拓展了社会主义报纸对社会新闻的报道领域，也在一定程度上丰富了人们对社会新闻内涵和外延的认识。
    什么是社会新闻？过去有一种看法，认为社会新闻就是反映奇闻怪事和报道社会阴暗面，搞一些猎奇式的东西。这显然是对我们社会主义的报纸如何报道社会新闻的一种误解。
    我们所说的社会新闻应当是指反映当前社会生活、社会事件、社会风气和社会问题，并具有社会教育意义的新闻。纵观这次全国晚报社会新闻大赛的2000多篇参赛稿，新闻视野相当开阔，报道题材也十分丰富，有反映社会新风尚，催人奋进，激发人们献身社会主义事业的，有反映社会主义人与人之间的新型关系的，也有揭露鞭挞不良社会现象的，有问题性的社会新闻，也有事件性的社会新闻，如此等等。但不管属哪一类题材，其报道都十分注重其社会教育意义。可以说，注意社会新闻积极的社会意义是我们社会主义新闻区别于资产阶级社会新闻的重要标志。
    社会新闻应十分注重社会教育意义，力求通过典型的社会新闻倡导正气，弘扬社会主义道德风范，促进社会主义精神文明建设。新民晚报参赛稿《事业、爱情、家庭》就是一篇注意把握较高格调并具有深刻教育意义的社会新闻。这篇通讯，写的是著名女科学家谢希德常年累月无微不至地关心照顾重病中的丈夫的动人故事。由于谢希德有很高的知名度，所以她那鲜为人知的纯真爱情故事以及她在家庭生活中高尚的精神境界，就具有非同一般的感染力和教育作用。这虽是名人凡事，但最能反映出一个人的品格和精神。武汉晚报参赛稿《血染的录像带》，报道今年1月2日，武汉发生油驳燃爆事故中消防宣传干部程敬发的事迹。程敬发同志赴汤蹈火，拍摄现场录像，最后油驳爆炸，他以身殉职，录像带沉入了江底，在最后二十二分钟闪耀着烈士的生命之光，当人们看到从江中捞出的录像带时，无不为他潸然泪下，他用自己的生命谱写了一曲英雄凯歌。
    为了抵制腐朽思想的侵蚀和消除各种不良风气，社会新闻还应经常开展报纸批评，鞭挞不良社会现象，发挥舆论监督作用。如哈尔滨新晚报《毛阿敏一次逃税三万元》的社会新闻，通过披露这位红歌星春节来哈尔滨走穴，五天拿走六万元，逃税三万元的事实，揭示了一种“毛阿敏现象”，从而引起强烈的社会反响。这则新闻的社会教育意义极为深刻，它提出了严格税收管理、加强文化市场管理、加强演员思想教育工作以及解决社会分配不公等问题，引起社会各阶层的震动，在全国范围内成了议论的热门话题，给人们留下深远的启示。
    问题报道，不只是揭露生活中的阴暗面，而且能指出生活中的更大课题，防止各种不良倾向的发生和发展。如羊城晚报参赛稿《盲目的洪流》等三篇连续报道将今春发生的带有全国性的“民工”问题，放在改革开放的大背景中，进行多侧面的思考分析，写出了一组有述有评，颇具深度的报道，这是记者强烈的社会责任感和竞争意识的产物，对扭转“盲流”问题起了很大作用。
