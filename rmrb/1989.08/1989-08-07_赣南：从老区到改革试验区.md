Neighboring regions are rising, what will Gannan do?

This is a famous revolutionary base. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Central Revolutionary Base was established in Gannan. During the Long March, Gannan lost 250,000 people. Some say: Gannan has made a special contribution to the revolution.

This is a vast area of red soil hills. It is notoriously infertile. After the country gained power, the state provided Gannan with tens of millions of yuan in relief and subsidies each year. For over 30 years, the people of Gannan have struggled for basic sustenance. By 1987, the total industrial and agricultural output value of Gannan's 18 counties (cities) was less than half of that of Shaoguan in Guangdong. The per capita income of farmers was only about 300 yuan, and 13 counties were still in deficit, relying on imports for grain, cotton, and oil. Facing the rapid rise of neighboring Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which have opened up and become more dynamic, Gannan has obviously become an economic dwarf.

Gannan also has natural disadvantages: no railways, inconvenient transportation, poor information flow, insufficient energy, although there are underground mineral resources, they are only at the initial processing stage, and farmers lack commercial awareness. After repeated studies, the Jiangxi provincial leadership and Gannan regional leadership decided to designate Gannan as an economic reform experimental zone starting from January 1, 1988, allowing their policies to align with those of Guangdong and Fujian. What Guangdong and Fujian can do, Gannan can also do based on its actual situation.

Jiangxi wisely implements a preferential policy for Gannan.

Creating the Reform Experimental Zone

Practice has shown that the power of policy combined with ideological change is the forerunner of social change. The experimental zone has been in operation for only a year and a half, and people are increasingly aware of this.

In Longnan County's Xiaomu Village, there is a fishery with 307 mu of water surface and 12 workers. Each year, 5,000 yuan is invested, but only 9,000 jin of fish are produced, not even enough to support the workers. The relevant departments resolutely carried out reforms, publicly inviting talented individuals, and the result was that the fishery was contracted to Zhong Shuisheng and his wife. Two years later, 50,000 jin of fish were produced, of which 45,000 jin were sold, and 4,000 yuan in taxes were paid. The couple also raised 150 pigs. Zhong Shuisheng and his wife set an example for local farmers in commercial agriculture. Gannan region seized on this type of model, focusing on further consolidating and improving the household contract responsibility system and agricultural production responsibility system. Now, 80% of the state-owned agricultural, forestry, and fishery farms have been contracted through bidding.

In Gannan, each person has 8 mu of land and 8 mu of mountains, with over a million surplus laborers. In the past, farmers would sing such mountain songs: "In summer, there is rice; in winter, there is fire; a few hens and two pigs; even the gods in heaven are not as good as me." They stayed at home doing nothing, the mountains were bare, and the fields were abandoned. Agricultural investment is not necessarily monetary investment. If one laborer works 100 days a year, the surplus of a million laborers is an investment of over a billion workdays, which can create wealth by afforesting the mountains, aquaculture, developing township enterprises, and commercial circulation.

The Gannan leadership has issued several specific policy regulations on agricultural issues. Farmers' enthusiasm has been unleashed, and in the first year of the experimental zone, agricultural production has increased across the board. Citrus, tea, and aquatic products have all reached their highest historical levels, with an increase of 45 million jin of grain. This year, early rice is also expected to be bountiful. What is particularly gratifying is that last winter, oilseed rape was planted in fallow fields, and this spring, 750 million jin of oil and 1,500 million jin of oil cake were harvested. The days of Gannan relying on imports for oil are coming to an end.

Removing checkpoints and developing horizontal ties

The comrades in Gannan realized that they started the experimental zone without a large amount of capital investment, so they could not blindly copy the practices of special economic zones and ignore the guidance of the market. They could only start from reality and choose the right breakthrough point for development. For example, in the face of the geographical advantage of the Fujian and Guangdong special zones and the vast market of Hong Kong, Macao, and Southeast Asia, Gannan's circulation was not smooth. Therefore, improving the circulation environment, enhancing economic vitality, catalyzing market development, and activating circulation are things that can be effective without spending much money.

Gannan's border with Fujian and Guangdong is over 400 kilometers long. In the past, Gannan was afraid that agricultural and sideline products would flow into Fujian and Guangdong, so 189 checkpoints were set up. One incident made the comrades in Gannan brave enough to break through the barrier: Xingguo County had 70,000 pigs, each averaging 104 jin. Fujian and Guangdong buyers offered 3.8 to 4.6 yuan per jin, but higher authorities did not allow the pigs to be sold out, so they could only be sold within Jiangxi at 2.2 yuan per jin. Farmers were unwilling to sell and had many complaints. The Gannan regional leadership felt that this was not just a problem for Xingguo County, but also for other counties. They started from reality, encouraging farmers to develop pig farming, ensuring local market supply while removing checkpoints and allowing pigs to be sold to Fujian and Guangdong. This single move alone increased Xingguo County's income by over 14 million yuan. Farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs was aroused, and their commercial awareness was strengthened. Through this incident, the comrades in Gannan made up their minds to abolish all checkpoints that obstructed circulation and open up more than a hundred border markets. In the past, Quannan County's watermelons were only sold to Guangdong at 200,000 jin, but last year, 8 million jin were sold, and this county's rural income increased by 50 yuan per person from this alone. Shicheng County's white lotus is famous, and after the border market opened, it increased from 1.5 million jin to over 10 million jin. After Xinyu County opened its border, 90% of the county's fertilizer came from Guangdong, which was not only faster but also cheaper than transporting it from 500 kilometers away in Nanchang.

In a year and a half of removing checkpoints and trading, the region's net income from inter-provincial trade has reached 200 million yuan, equivalent to more than one times the current vertical investment and internal accumulation that can be used for investment. At the same time, the extensive horizontal economic ties that use trade as a catalyst have also been widely developed, with a total of 601 contracts signed, 5,394 ten thousand yuan of actual introduced funds, and a total trade volume of 427 million yuan, all of which have increased several times compared to before.

Reforming the internal mechanism of enterprises and promoting industrial development

Gannan's industry is underdeveloped, known as "small, poor, and lacking": small enterprises account for 97% of all enterprises in the region; enterprises are so poor that they lack the ability to develop themselves; enterprise management talents are in short supply, "frequent losers are often in charge, and the eighteen luohan are rotating." To change this situation, they opened up, implementing the contract and lease operation responsibility system in all industrial and commercial enterprises, and selecting operators through public bidding. As a result, talents from both inside and outside the region have come in. The proportion of state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises in the region that have implemented contract operations and leasing has reached over 95%. The reporter visited Gannan Wireless Factory, where all 631 employees originally owed 1,000 ten thousand yuan in debt. After implementing the contract operation, they made 300 ten thousand yuan in profits and taxes in one year, repaying 200 ten thousand yuan in loans, and this year's economic benefits are also good. The Gannan Machinery Factory, which has been in operation for 18 years, has accumulated a loss of 734 ten thousand yuan, becoming a heavy burden for Ganzhou City. After implementing the lease operation in 1987, it made 130 ten thousand yuan in profits and taxes in one year.

In the first year of the experimental zone, the region's industrial production achieved new breakthroughs, completing the annual production plan 40 days ahead of schedule, and the profits and taxes of budgetary industrial enterprises and the profits and taxes handed over to the state both exceeded historical highs. At the same time, Gannan's individual and private economies have also developed, with 25 people per thousand engaged in individual industrial and commercial activities. Last year, the tax revenue from individual and private economies accounted for 9.5% of the region's fiscal revenue. Township enterprises have also developed rapidly, with 2,100 cadres from the region being sent to various townships to take up posts and manage township enterprises well. Now, 310,000 people are working in township enterprises. The once-depressed old revolutionary base now has a number of towns with total incomes exceeding 100 million yuan and villages with total incomes exceeding 10 million yuan.

In a year and a half, the 18 counties (cities) in the Gannan reform experimental zone have, for the first time since liberation, achieved increased income in every county. The region's fiscal revenue increased by 80 million yuan in one year, and in the first five months of this year, fiscal revenue increased by 14% compared to the same period last year. The number of counties that have eliminated deficits has increased from 3 last year to 11.

For many years, how to get rid of poverty and become prosperous in "old, minority, border, and poor" regions has been a big problem. The rapid economic development of the Gannan region provides valuable experience for others to learn from.

    赣南：从老区到改革试验区
    本报记者　赵相如
      毗邻在崛起，赣南怎么办
    这里是著名的老区。在第二次国内革命战争时期，中央根据地就建在赣南。长征时，赣南人牺牲25万，有人说：赣南对革命做出了特殊的贡献。
    这里是一片红壤丘陵。贫瘠得出了名。全国取得政权以后，国家每年给赣南几千万救济和补贴，赣南人民为温饱苦斗了30多年。到1987年，赣南18个县（市）工农业总产值还不到广东韶关地区的一半，农民人均收入只有300元左右，还有13个县入不敷出，粮、棉、油统统要靠调入。面对着毗邻广东、福建开放、搞活之后的迅速崛起，赣南显然成了经济上的侏儒。
    赣南确也有天然的不足：没有铁路，交通不便，信息不灵，能源不足，虽有地下矿产资源，也仅停留在初级加工阶段，农民的商品意识不强。江西省领导与赣南地区领导经过反复研究之后，决定从1988年1月1日起，把赣南列为经济体制改革试验区，允许他们的政策与广东、福建衔接，广东和福建能干的，赣南从实际出发也可以去干。
    江西明智地对赣南实行倾斜政策。
        创办改革试验区
    事实证明，政策的力量加上思想的变革，是社会变革的先导。试验区创办才1年半，人们对这一点看得越来越清楚了。
    龙南县小慕村有个水产场，307亩水面，12个工人，每年投入5000元，只产鱼9000斤，连工人都养不活。有关部门坚决进行变革，公开招贤，结果由钟水生夫妇承包。2年后，产鱼5万公斤，其中出售4.5万公斤，交税4000元。他们夫妇还饲养150头猪。钟水生夫妇为当地农民搞商品农业作出榜样。赣南地区抓住这一类典型，在进一步巩固和完善家庭联产承包和农业生产责任制上下功夫。现在国营农林水产场招标承包面已达80％。
    赣南人均8分田、8亩山，剩余劳力上百万。以前，农民爱唱这样的山歌：“夏有米饭冬有火，几只母鸡二头猪，天上神仙不及我。”守在家里无所事事，山上光了，田地荒了。农业投入不一定是资金投入。如果一个劳力一年投入100个工，剩余的百万劳力就是投入上亿个工，去山上造林，下水面养殖，搞乡镇企业和商品流通，能创造出多少财富！
    赣南的领导就农业问题连续下了好几个具体政策规定。农民积极性发挥出来了，改革试验区的头一年，农业全面增产，柑桔、茶叶、水产品总量均创历史最高水平，粮食增产4500万公斤，今年早稻又丰收在望。特别可喜的是，去冬冬闲田种上了油菜，今春收获750万公斤油和1500多万公斤油饼，赣南多年调进油吃的日子快结束了。
      撤除关卡，发展横向联系
    赣南的同志认识到，自己是在没有大量资金投入的情况下办起的试验区，因此，不能盲目照搬照抄特区的做法和忽视市场的导向作用，只能从实际出发，选准发展的突破口。比如，在面临闽粤特区和港澳东南亚广阔市场的地理优势情况下，赣南却流通不畅，那么，改善流通环境，增强经济活力，催化市场发育，搞活流通，是可以不花多少钱就能见效的。
    赣南与闽粤的边界长达400多公里，以前赣南怕农副土特产品流入闽粤，设下189个关卡。有一件事让赣南同志勇于冲破了防线：兴国县有7万头猪，平均每头已到104公斤，闽粤来收购一公斤出价3.8元—4.6元，上级有关部门不准生猪出去，只能在江西收购，每公斤出价2.2元。农民不愿卖，很有意见。赣南地区领导觉得不光兴国县有这类问题，其它县也有类似情况。他们从实际出发，鼓励农民发展生猪生产，除了保证本地市场供应以外，撤除关卡，允许把猪卖到闽粤去。单这一招，就让兴国县增加1400多万收入。农民养猪积极性调动起来了，商品经济意识增强了。通过这件事，赣南的同志下定决心，撤销所有阻碍流通的关卡，开放上百个边界集市。以前全南县西瓜只销广东20万公斤，去年销800万公斤，这个县农村单这一项人均增收50元。石城县白莲出名，边界市场开放后，由以前外销150 万公斤发展到1000多万公斤。寻乌县开放边界以后，全县90％以上的化肥由广东进来，比从500公里外的南昌运，不仅快了，还便宜。
    撤卡通商的一年半，全地区通过省际贸易所获得的货币净收入已达2亿元，相当于目前纵向投入和区内积累可用投资的1倍多，同时以贸易为契机的多元横向经济联系也得到广泛发展，共签订合同601项，实际引进资金5394万元，物资协进协出总金额达4.27亿，均比以前成倍地增长。
    改革企业内部机制，推动工业发展
    赣南的工业不发达，叫做“一小二穷三缺”：小企业占全地区企业的97％；企业穷得没有自我发展能力；企业管理人才奇缺，“常败将军常挂帅，十八罗汉打转转”。要改变这个境况，他们放开手脚，在所有工商企业中推行承包、租赁经营责任制，通过公开招标择优选择经营者，结果本地区和外地区的人才源源而来。全地区预算内国有工业企业和商业企业承包经营、租赁面已达95％以上。记者来到了赣南无线电厂，全厂631名职工，原先欠债1000多万元。实行承包经营后，一年下来，实现利税300万元，归还贷款200来万元，今年经济效益也不错。赣南机械厂创办以来的18年累计亏损734万元，成了赣州市一大包袱。1987年后实行租赁经营，一年时间实现利税130万元。
    创办试验区头一年，全区工业生产取得了新的突破，提前40天完成全年生产计划，预算内工业企业实现利税、上交利税均超历史最高水平。同时，赣南的个体和私营经济也有了发展，每千人中有25人从事个体工商业，去年个体和私营经济提供税收就占全地区财政收入的9.5％。乡镇企业也有了大发展，全地区抽调2100名干部下到各乡挂职办好乡镇企业，现在已有31万人在乡镇企业劳动。过去沉寂的老区，现在有了一大批总收入超千万元的乡和超百万元的村。
    赣南改革试验区在一年半中，18个县（市）在解放以来第一次实现县县增收，全地区一年财政收入增8000万元，今年头5个月财政收入又比去年同期增长14％。消灭赤字的县从上年的3个增加到11个。
    多年来，“老少边穷”地区如何摆脱穷困，走向富裕，一直是个大问题。赣南地区经济飞速发展，所走出的路，向人们提供了可资借鉴的经验。
