Shenyang Railway Bureau Chief Li Daqiang recently revealed to reporters: Due to the entire bureau's workers upholding the spirit of ownership, the railway bureau has leveraged its overall advantages. This year, from January to July, seven major transportation production indicators, including daily car loading volume, cargo shipment volume, and transportation revenue, all set new historical records for the bureau. The bureau has also achieved 230 consecutive days of safe production.

Shenyang Railway Bureau is one of the 12 railway bureaus in China with the most workers and the longest operational mileage. In the first seven months of this year, the bureau encountered many unexpected difficulties: at the beginning of the year, cargo sources were unbalanced; from April to June, operations were disrupted and affected by the aftermath of the Beijing unrest; and since July, 13 lines have been disrupted due to floods and landslides.

Faced with these challenges, the bureau's leadership remained undeterred. From the start of the new year, they emphasized high targets and proposed the slogan "Safety for 100 days, tasks surpassing history" to inspire workers to overcome difficulties and strive forward. As a result, in the first quarter, they not only successfully completed production tasks but also won the Ministry of Railways' excellent continuous red flag. After the Beijing unrest, the bureau's workers remained undisturbed, maintaining an attendance rate of over 98%. At that time, some sections within the bureau were obstructed, but they found every possible way to increase speed and efficiency on the over 8,000 kilometers of operational lines within the bureau. When the bureau was hit by floods and landslides, they mobilized all available forces to repair 12 lines in a short time and, at the same time, utilized the bureau's large operational flexibility to more reasonably and effectively use transportation capacity.

    发扬职工主人翁精神
    沈铁运输创历史纪录
    本报讯　沈阳铁路局局长李大强日前向记者透露：由于全局职工发扬了主人翁精神，铁路局发挥了整体优势，今年1—7月份的日装车量、货物发送量、运输收入等7项主要运输生产指标，全都刷新了该局历史纪录，已连续安全生产230天。
    沈阳铁路局是我国12个铁路局中，职工最多、管辖营业里程最长的大型企业。今年前7个月，该局遇到了许多意想不到的困难：年初时货源不平衡，4—6月受到北京动乱冲击波的干扰和影响，7月以来又有13条线路因洪水和泥石流而中断。
    面对困难，该局领导不急不馁，新年伊始就强调奔高目标，提出“安全夺百日，任务超历史”的口号，激励职工克服困难，奋发向上。结果一季度不仅胜利完成生产任务，还夺得了铁道部优胜循环红旗。北京发生动乱后，全局职工不受干扰，坚持上岗到位，出勤率一直保持在98％以上。当时管内有些铁路路段受阻，他们就千方百计在管内的8000多公里营业线上多拉快运。在该局遭到洪水和泥石流的袭击时，他们一方面动员一切力量使12条线路在短时间内修复，一方面发挥本局回旋余地大的优势，更加合理有效地使用运输能力。
