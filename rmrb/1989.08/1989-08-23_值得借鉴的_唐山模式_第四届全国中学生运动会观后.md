For the more than 600 middle school athletes who participated, the recently concluded Fourth National Middle School Games (track and field competition) was not just a venue for competition but also a classroom for learning how to be a person.

As early as March this year, the State Education Commission, the State Sports Commission, and the Communist Youth League issued a notice for this games, emphasizing that the games should have the characteristics of a summer camp. The organizing committee decided to use the unique educational environment of the games to conduct ideological education for the athletes, especially on the spirit of hard work and patriotism. The committee also reformed the games from organizational form to content.

The athletes, along with their team leaders and coaches, stayed at Tangshan No. 1 Middle School for their meals and competitions, instead of staying in large hotels as usual. They slept in the school's dormitories, using bedding and pillows brought from home by the students. They had to tidy up their rooms, fetch water, clean dishes, and set the tables themselves. Every day, there was a competition to see which dormitory was the cleanest, which table was the neatest and had no waste, and a small red flag was awarded. The number of flags was an important condition for the post-event evaluation of moral excellence awards.

Traditional activities such as banquets, gift-giving, sightseeing, and large-scale group performances were canceled, replaced by new programs with educational significance.

The conference organized the athletes to visit the "City Rising from the Ruins" photo exhibition, the earthquake site, the anti-earthquake exhibition hall, and Tangshan Mine and Ceramics Factory. The participating athletes also received a special gift – the book "The Tangshan Earthquake." Several members of the Shanghai team told a reporter that the heroic people of Tangshan, especially the working class, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the superiority of the socialist system and the rescue of the people of the whole country and the People's Liberation Army, worked hard to build a new Tangshan from the ruins. "These facts, we will never forget in our lifetime."

As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." The combination of competition and education achieved good results. The competition atmosphere and the athletes' spiritual outlook were better than in previous years, with good deeds such as picking up lost items and helping others happening frequently. An Zhiqian, deputy director of the organizing committee and deputy director of the Hebei Provincial Education Commission, believes that the "Tangshan Model" of the Middle School Games is worth emulating.

    值得借鉴的“唐山模式”
    ——第四届全国中学生运动会观后
    对于参赛的600多名中学生运动员来说，最近刚结束的第四届全国中学生运动会（田径比赛）不仅是竞技的场所，而且是学习如何做人的课堂。
    早在今年3月，国家教委、国家体委和团中央在举办这届运动会的通知中，就强调要使运动会带有夏令营特点。组委会决定利用运动会这种特殊的育人环境对运动员进行思想教育，尤其是艰苦奋斗精神、爱国主义等教育，并对这届中运会从组织形式到内容进行了改革。
    运动员和他们的领队、教练的食宿、比赛均在唐山市第一中学，而未像往常一样住大宾馆、大饭店。他们睡的是一中学生宿舍里的上下床，铺的、枕的是一中学生从家里抱来的褥子、枕头。他们需要自己整理房间、取开水、清洗餐具、饭桌，自我服务。每天还要评比：哪个宿舍整洁，哪个餐桌卫生、无浪费现象，就插小红旗。旗子的多寡是会后评选道德风尚奖的重要条件。
    宴请、送纪念礼品、游览名胜古迹、大型团体操表演等传统项目均取消了，代替的是一些富有教育意义的新节目。
    大会先后组织运动员参观了《在废墟上崛起的城市》图片展览、地震遗址、抗震陈列馆以及唐山矿、陶瓷厂等。与会运动员还得到一件特殊的礼物——《唐山大地震》一书。上海队几名队员对记者谈观感时说，英雄的唐山人民特别是工人阶级在党的领导下，依靠社会主义制度的优越性，依靠全国人民和解放军的救援，艰苦奋斗，在虚墟上建设了新唐山，“这些事实，我们一辈子也忘不了。”
    种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。既竞技又育人收到了很好的效果，这届运动会的赛风、运动员的精神面貌都好于以往，拾金不昧、助人为乐等好人好事不断出现。大会组委会副主任、河北省教委副主任安效珍认为，中运会“唐山模式”值得借鉴。　（忻华）
