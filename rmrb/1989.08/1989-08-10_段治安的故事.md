Duan Zhian is the Party Branch Secretary, Village Committee Director, and Company Manager of Xixiaomozui Village, Yingchengzi Town, Ganpingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province.

Xixiaomozui Village is located by the picturesque Bohai Sea. Over the past few years, the 1,580 people of Xixiaomozui Village have developed agriculture, fisheries, and secondary industries simultaneously. Now, the village has become one with an annual total income exceeding ten million yuan. While wealth has flowed into the hands of the people, the integrity of a Communist Party member has not faded from the heart of Old Duan.

In today's era of a commodity economy, going out to discuss business inevitably involves eating a meal and drinking a cup of wine. Whenever such situations arise, Old Duan often pays out of his own pocket, spending thousands of yuan each year. In 1986, he went to Shenzhen to discuss business and upon his return, he only reported the car and accommodation expenses, covering over six hundred yuan in entertainment expenses himself. Last year, Old Duan led the village cadres to visit the Chengsha Factory in Kuandian County, staying in Dandong. They did not stay in the more comfortable Yalu River Grand Hotel but chose the more affordable guesthouse. Facing the scenic Yalu River, someone suggested he stay in Dandong for a couple of days, but he insisted, "We are here to work, not to play. How can we afford to delay production?" After completing the task, he quickly returned to the village.

The village has a minivan and a double-row sedan, but Old Duan rarely uses them for his outings. When the town holds meetings, some village cadres who live closer to the town take the car, but Old Duan always rides a bicycle. When higher-ups come to inspect work, whoever is involved accompanies them for a simple meal, and the rest of the cadres are not allowed to participate.

Whenever the village restaurant opens or someone invites him to a meal, Old Duan always declines. He often says, "Cadres cannot take advantage, eating and drinking will ruin the image of Party members and cadres." In 1987, the village arranged for Yu Tongle's son, the oil depot custodian, to work at the forging press factory due to work needs. Yu Tongle was very grateful and sent several bottles of wine and other gifts to Old Duan's home at the end of the year, but Old Duan politely declined. He said, "This is a work need, not a personal favor." The demobilized soldier Jia Defu, who returned to the village in 1983, had a difficult life, and the village helped him build three rooms. During the lunar month, he brought two bottles of wine to Old Duan's door. When leaving, not only did he take back the two bottles of wine, but he also received two bottles of wine and some clothes from Old Duan.

Duan Zhian's wife, Ju Yuping, suffers from hypertension. In 1984, the former village head, Yu Chuncheng, considering her illness, arranged for her to work as a janitor at the village school. In 1985, after Old Duan took over as the head, he felt that "my wife doing light work, the backbone of the secretary is not strong." He persuaded his wife to return to the vegetable field to work. At first, his wife was not convinced. Late at night, the two sat on the kang without saying a word. "You are the head, and I have to suffer?" After a long silence, his wife muttered, facing away from Old Duan. Old Duan saw that his wife had spoken, and quickly said, "I also feel sorry for you. I can't take care of the family all day, and it's not that I want you to work in the vegetable field. The problem is that no one wants to do it now. If we, the cadre's family, don't take the lead, who will? Isn't that the difference between us and the masses?" Seeing that Ju Yuping had no reaction, he added, "I think you've become lazy, not as hardworking as you used to be..." Before he finished, his wife exploded, "Who says I've become lazy?" Old Duan laughed. His wife was reasonable, and after a few days, she went to work in the vegetable field. Later, Old Duan arranged for a sick woman working in the vegetable field to become a janitor at the school.

Duan Zhian's father is a retired engineer. Over the years, the eight enterprises and the village committee office building that the village has undertaken were all designed by him. According to regulations, the village should pay over thirty thousand yuan in design fees, but Old Duan firmly refused to accept it. Other village cadres were unhappy, "The old man is already so old, working for you, Old Duan, not taking the money is fine, but working for the people of Xixiaomozui, he can't work for free! Not giving compensation, the elders and fellow villagers won't agree!" They secretly gave him one thousand yuan behind Old Duan's back. Old Duan found out and scolded his father severely.

Ju Yuping's relatives from her maternal home did not benefit from Old Duan. Duan Zhian's younger brother has been fishing at sea for many years; his sister-in-law also works in the vegetable field. The only one who has a bit of an "official" connection is his maternal uncle, Wang Qimin, who was originally the captain of the marine fishery team, but in 1986, because of his negligence in work, he was dismissed by Duan Zhian.

    段治安的故事
    夏春光
    段治安，是辽宁省大连市甘井子区营城子镇西小磨子村的党支部书记、村委会主任兼公司经理。
    西小磨子村座落在风景秀丽的渤海边。几年来，一千五百八十名西小磨子人农业、渔业、工副业齐头并进，如今已成为一个年总收入超过千万元的村庄。金银流进了群众手中，而一名共产党员的清廉作风并没有从老段心中淌出。
    在商品经济发展的今天，外出谈生意，免不了要吃顿饭、喝杯酒。凡是遇到这种情况，老段经常自己掏腰包，每年要自己贴上千元。一九八六年他去深圳洽谈业务，回来后只报了个车宿费，自己贴了六百多元钱的交际费。去年，老段带领村干部去宽甸县棚砂厂考察，路宿丹东，他们没有去住条件较好的鸭绿江大厦而是住进了价格便宜的招待所。面对风景迷人的鸭绿江畔，有人动员他在丹东玩两天，他却坚持说：“咱是来工作的，又不是来玩的，耽误生产怎么办？”办完事后就迅速返回村里。
    村里有辆面包车和一辆双排座汽车，平时老段出门很少坐。镇里开会，有些离镇里较近的村干部都坐车去，而老段从来都是骑自行车。遇到上边来检查工作，涉及到哪位村干部，谁就陪着吃顿便饭，其余干部一律不得沾边。
    每逢村里饭店开张或哪家吃请，老段都一一拒绝。他常说：“当干部的不能捞，吃吃喝喝把党员干部的形象喝没了、吃坏了。”一九八七年，村里根据工作需要安排了油库保管员于同乐的儿子到锻压厂工作，于同乐很感激，年底到老段家送去几瓶酒和其它礼品，被老段婉言拒绝了。他说：“我们这是工作需要，又不是看你个人关系。”退伍军人贾德阜，一九八三年回村后，生活很困难，村里帮他建了三间房。腊月里他拎着两瓶酒敲开了老段的家门。出门时，不但拎走了那两瓶酒，还多了老段送给他的两瓶酒和一些衣物。
    段治安的妻子叫鞠玉萍，患有高血压病。一九八四年村前任书记于春成考虑到她的病，安排她到村学校当勤杂工。一九八五年老段接任书记后，他觉得“自己老婆干轻巧活儿，当书记的腰杆子不硬。”于是，他动员老伴回到菜田干活。一开始老伴有些想不通。夜深人静了，两口子坐在炕上谁也不吱声。“你当书记，俺就得跟你倒霉？”半晌，老伴背对着老段嘟囔一句，老段一看老伴开口了，忙说：“俺也心疼你呀，我整天顾不了家，并不是我非得让你上菜田干活，问题是现在大家都不愿干，咱干部家属不带头谁带头？咱和群众的区别不就在这儿吗？”看到鞠玉萍没动静，他又将了一军：“我看你是变懒了，不如年轻时那么勤快了……”没等他说完，老伴就炸了：“谁说我变懒了？”老段一听乐了。妻子是通情达理的，没几天，就到菜田干活去了。接着，老段把一位在菜田干活的有病的妇女安排到学校当了勤杂工。
    段治安的父亲是个退休工程师，几年来，村里上马的八个企业和村委会办公楼，全是他一手设计的。按规定，村里应付三万多元的设计费，可老段坚决不要。其他村干部不干了：“老爷子这么一大把年纪的人了，给你老段干，不要行，可是给西小磨子人干，总不能白干吧？不给报酬，父老乡亲们也不能答应！”硬是背着老段给了一千元，老段知道后，狠狠地数落了父亲一番。
    鞠玉萍娘家的亲戚也没有人沾老段的光。段治安的弟弟在海上打鱼多年；弟媳也在菜田种地。唯一沾点“官”字的就是姨夫王其敏，他原是海上渔业队队长，但一九八六年因为工作不尽职尽责，被段治安撤职了。
