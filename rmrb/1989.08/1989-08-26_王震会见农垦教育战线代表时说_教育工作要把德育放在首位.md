Vice Chairman Wang Zhen said today morning at the Great Hall of the People while meeting with representatives attending the National Agricultural Reclamation Education Advanced Awards Conference that education work should prioritize moral education and strive to cultivate a new generation with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

Wang Zhen said, over the past 40 years, especially in the past 10 years, our education work has achieved great successes, but there are also many problems. In recent years, due to the spread of bourgeois liberalization, we have not properly implemented the correct educational policy set by the Party Central Committee at that time under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, that is, the policy of combining education with practical work and production labor. We have not prioritized moral education and have not properly implemented the policy of developing morality, intelligence, and physical fitness comprehensively. In the future, we must resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, cultivate successors to the cause of communism, and make the bourgeois prophets' dream of "peaceful evolution" placed on the third and fourth generations of China completely fail. The experts, professors, and teachers present are shouldering the responsibility of cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause. I believe you will definitely be able to make due contributions to the socialist modernization drive.

Wang Zhen pointed out that the broad masses of intellectuals on the agricultural reclamation front have made great contributions to the construction of the agricultural reclamation cause and the development of agricultural reclamation education work under harsh conditions. They are the outstanding representatives of Chinese intellectuals.

Wang Zhen expressed respect to the outstanding teachers who have made contributions to China's agricultural reclamation education cause. He hoped that the broad masses of educational workers on the agricultural reclamation front would carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, love the frontier, and take root in the frontier, making the socialist agricultural reclamation cause vibrant and prosperous.

The representatives attending the awards conference reported to Vice Chairman Wang Zhen on the basic situation and achievements of the agricultural reclamation education cause.

    王震会见农垦教育战线代表时说
    教育工作要把德育放在首位
    据新华社北京8月26日电　（记者任泽励）国家副主席王震今天上午在人民大会堂会见参加全国农垦教育先进表彰会的代表时说，教育工作要坚持把德育放在第一位，努力培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人。
    王震说，40年来特别是近10年来，我们的教育工作取得了很大成绩，但也存在不少问题。这几年，由于资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，没有很好地贯彻毛泽东同志那时的党中央定下的正确教育方针，即教育联系实际，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，没有把德育放在第一位，没有很好地贯彻德智体全面发展的方针。今后我们一定要坚决贯彻党的教育方针，培养共产主义事业接班人，让资产阶级预言家们把“和平演变”寄托在中国第三代、第四代身上的梦想彻底破产。在座的专家、教授和广大教师肩负着培养革命事业接班人的重任，相信你们一定能够为社会主义四化建设作出应有的贡献。
    王震指出，农垦战线的广大知识分子在艰苦的条件下屯垦戍边，为农垦事业的建设和农垦教育工作的发展作出了重大贡献。他们才是中国知识分子的杰出代表。
    王震对为我国农垦教育事业作出贡献的优秀教师表示敬意，他希望农垦战线的广大教育工作者发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，热爱边疆、扎根边疆，使社会主义的农垦事业生气勃勃、兴旺发达。
    参加表彰会的代表们向王震副主席汇报了农垦教育事业的基本情况和取得的成绩。
