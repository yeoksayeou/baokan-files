A new steelmaking method that uses a new type of carbon additive to replace pig iron as the raw material has emerged in China, reducing the cost per ton of steel by 54 yuan. This was announced at the recent National Steelmaking Iron-Saving Conference held in Hohhot.

It is understood that in recent years, some foreign countries have also begun to use smokeless coal, coke, and other additives to replace pig iron in steelmaking, but the overall economic benefits are not ideal.

China uses cryptocrystalline graphite as a carbon additive. Every 700 kilograms can replace 9 tons of pig iron. After trials at the Fushun Steel Plant, the results were significant, which is of great importance in alleviating the tight supply of pig iron raw materials in China's steelmaking operations.

It is reported that this cryptocrystalline graphite is found in the territory of Zhalute Banner, Chifeng League, Inner Mongolia. The proven reserves are 150 million tons.

    国内出现不投入生铁的炼钢法
    新华社呼和浩特8月12日电　（记者瞿振业）我国出现一种以新型增炭剂替代生铁作为炼钢原料的炼钢新法，可使吨钢成本降低54元。这是日前在这里召开的全国炼钢节铁会议上宣布的。
    据了解，近年来国外一些国家也开始用无烟煤、焦炭等作为增添剂取代生铁投入炼钢，但综合经济效益不太理想。
    我国采用隐晶体石墨作为增炭剂，每700千克可取代9吨生铁，在抚顺钢厂试用后效果显著，对缓和我国炼钢作业中生铁原料供应紧张状况有重要意义。
    据悉，这种隐晶体石墨蕴藏在内蒙古哲里木盟扎鲁特旗境内，现已探明储量为1.5亿吨。
