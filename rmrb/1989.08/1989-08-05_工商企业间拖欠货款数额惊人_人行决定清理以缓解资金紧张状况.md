People's Bank Decides to Clear Overdue Payments to Ease Financial Tightness

BEIJING, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) — According to information obtained by reporter Shi Mingshen from the meeting of the heads of the People's Bank of China's branches nationwide, one of the key tasks for financial work in the second half of this year is to expedite the clearing of overdue payments by enterprises.

Statistics show that the total amount of overdue payments by enterprises nationwide has reached 110 billion yuan. Such a severe obstruction in financial activities has become a prominent issue affecting current economic development. According to financial experts, the causes of overdue payments are multifaceted and cannot be resolved by the bank alone. It requires the coordination of various levels of government and the joint efforts of all parties to address the issue comprehensively.

It is understood that the main reasons for the significant increase in overdue payments by enterprises are as follows: after the bank tightened credit, loans to enterprises with poor economic performance could not be reduced immediately, making it difficult to ensure the funding needs of key enterprises and those with good economic performance, leading to difficulties in the turnover of funds for these enterprises. The reduction of construction investment also resulted in a large amount of overdue payments by enterprises. Additionally, as the settlement banks for enterprises, the enforcement of settlement disciplines is not strict, and they often fail to fairly protect the rights of both buyers and sellers, frequently refusing to pay or intentionally delaying payments, resulting in artificial overdue payments.

The meeting of the heads of the People's Bank of China's branches pointed out that, from the perspective of the bank, the work of clearing overdue payments must be combined with the adjustment of the credit structure and the clearing of inventory and potential. Some enterprises have overdue payments mainly due to the accumulation of a large amount of products and raw materials, many of which are in short supply in the market. The bank should take effective measures to promote their transportation and sales, and clear the overdue payments. During the process of clearing overdue payments, commercial bills should be vigorously promoted, and bank acceptance and discounting should be implemented to gradually standardize commercial credit. At the same time, the bank should, in accordance with relevant regulations, assist the financial and tax departments in resolving the issue of enterprises' tax arrears, and urge the financial department to promptly allocate the loss subsidies that have not been allocated. Enterprises with deposits should have their overdue tax payments collected by the bank without delay, and the bank should not withhold or use national treasury funds.

    工商企业间拖欠货款数额惊人
    人行决定清理以缓解资金紧张状况
    本报北京八月五日讯　记者施明慎从中国人民银行全国分行长会议上获悉：今年下半年金融工作的重点之一是，抓紧清理企业拖欠。
    据统计，目前全国企业拖欠货款总额达一千一百亿元，资金活动出现如此严重梗阻，已成为影响当前经济发展的一个突出问题。据此间金融界人士分析，拖欠货款的原因是多方面的，不能靠银行一家拿钞去解决，必须依靠各级政府，组织各方面力量，综合治理。
    据了解，造成企业拖欠货款大量增加的主要原因是银行在抽紧银根后，对经济效益差的企业贷款一时压不下来，所以对一些重点企业和经济效益好的企业资金需要也一时难以保证，致使这些企业资金周转发生困难。清理压缩基建投资也造成了企业的大量拖欠；此外，作为企业的开户银行执行结算纪律不严，不能公正维护购销双方的权利，往往站在开户企业的一方，无理拒付，有意拖压，造成人为拖欠。
    人民银行全国分行长会议指出，就银行方面而言，清欠工作必须和调整信贷结构结合起来，同清仓挖潜结合起来。有些企业拖欠货款主要是由于产品和原材料大量积压，其中不少是市场上紧俏的商品，银行要采取有效措施，促其调运、销售，清还拖欠。在清欠过程中，必须大力推行商业票据，银行承兑贴现，使商业信用逐步规范化。同时，银行还要按有关规定，一方面协助财政、税务部门解决企业欠税的问题，另一方面敦促财政把应拨未拨的亏损补贴尽快拨下去。企业有存款，到期交税的款项，后经收银行不准扣压、占用国库资金。
