Beijing's audit of 267 municipal contract-operated enterprises indicates that the contract responsibility system has strengthened the enterprises' incentive mechanisms. Most enterprises achieved their 1988 contract operation targets, completed or exceeded their remittance tasks, and saw increases in enterprise retained profits and worker incomes. However, the enterprises' self-regulatory mechanisms are insufficient, and some enterprises have issues with violating financial disciplines.

Last year, 419 municipal industrial enterprises in Beijing implemented the contract operation system. Recently, the Beijing Audit Bureau completed audits of 267 of these enterprises. The "two guarantees and one linkage" contract operation system clearly defined the interests of the state, enterprises, and workers, mobilizing the enterprises' enthusiasm. Despite factors such as rising material prices increasing costs, most contract-operated enterprises' main economic indicators still outperformed the previous year. The 267 contract-operated enterprises achieved a total profit and tax of 24.7 billion yuan, an increase of 20.5% over the previous year; the per capita labor productivity was 28,241 yuan, an increase of 10.4% over the previous year; 252 enterprises completed or exceeded their remittance tasks. Most enterprises also saw increases in retained profits and worker incomes.

The audit also revealed that enterprises lack self-regulatory mechanisms. Some enterprises have issues with violating financial disciplines, with a total of 40.045 million yuan in discovered violations. Some enterprises arbitrarily inflate costs, expand the scope of cost expenditures, artificially adjust profit figures, and cause enterprises' profits and losses to be inaccurate. Some enterprises create various pretexts to issue money and goods indiscriminately, expanding the consumption fund. Additionally, the technical renovation guarantee in the "two guarantees and one linkage" needs improvement.

Beijing's relevant departments have handled the discovered violations according to the circumstances and are currently studying methods to further improve the contract system.

    北京对承包企业审计发现
    利益激励机制增强  自我约束机制较弱
    本报北京8月17日讯　记者皮树义报道：北京市审计局对市属267户承包经营企业的审计表明，承包经营责任制增强了企业的利益激励机制，多数企业实现了1988年承包经营年度目标，完成或超额完成了上交任务，企业留利和职工收入也有增长，但是企业的自我约束机制不足，一些企业存在着违反财经纪律的问题。
    北京市去年有419户市属工业企业实行了承包经营，不久前北京审计局完成了对其中267户企业的审计。“两保一挂”承包经营明确了国家、企业、职工三者利益关系，调动了企业积极性。去年在原材料涨价等增支因素增多的情况下，多数承包企业主要经济指标仍好于上年。267户承包企业共实现利税24.7亿元，比上年增长20.5％；全员劳动生产率28241元，比上年提高10.4％；252户企业完成或超额完成了上交任务。多数企业的留利和职工收入也有一定增长。
    审计中也发现，企业缺乏自我约束机制。一些企业存在着违反财经纪律的问题，被查出的违纪金额达4004.5万元。有的企业乱挤乱摊成本，扩大成本开支范围，人为调节利润数额，造成企业盈亏不实；有的企业巧立名目，滥发钱物，扩大消费基金。此外“两保一挂”中的保技术改造也需要完善。
    北京市有关部门对发现的违纪问题分别情况做了处理，并正在研究办法进一步完善承包制。
