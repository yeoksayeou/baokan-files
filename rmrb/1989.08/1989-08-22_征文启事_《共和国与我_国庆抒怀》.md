*The Republic and Me—Reflections on National Day*

When the phrase "The Republic and Me" is mentioned, every citizen living in this era of China will surely recall many personal experiences and have much to say. Especially now, as October 1st draws near. On October 1st, 1949, a great historical voice echoed across Tiananmen Square: "The Chinese people have stood up!" This voice has resonated across the land and throughout the world for 40 years.

Looking back, the journey has been filled with twists and turns, and the achievements have been extraordinary, stirring the heart; looking ahead, there are even greater challenges and more glorious creations to come, inspiring the imagination. Our great motherland is in its prime, and socialism is full of vitality. Reflecting on the past and the future, every Chinese person who shares the fate of the Republic cannot help but feel a surge of passion and pride, and be filled with courage and strength.

To celebrate the tremendous achievements of the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, especially the magnificent accomplishments of the past 10 years of reform and opening up, to reflect the heroic deeds of the broad masses of people on various fronts, and to express the sincere love for the Party and the People's Republic, the newspaper has decided to launch the "The Republic and Me—Reflections on National Day" essay contest starting today. Dear readers, please pick up your pens and write about the extraordinary journey of the past 40 years, about the tremendous changes in the Republic, and about your own growth and the changes around you, to express your sincere patriotic feelings.

The essays should be written in the first person, with completely true content, focusing on personal experiences, and incorporating emotions and logic. The ideal length is around 1500 words. The deadline for submissions is September 30th. Please send your entries to the editorial office of the People's Daily (Postal Code: 100733), clearly marking "essay contest" and affixing sufficient postage. We regret that we cannot return manuscripts.

After the contest, we will select 3 first prizes, 5 second prizes, and 10 third prizes, and provide appropriate rewards.
