Our township is located in the deep mountains of western Hubei, where transportation is extremely inconvenient. For at least five months each year, external transportation is cut off. Our township is famous for producing garlic. In 1985, the county's self-sufficient finance office, despite having no technical personnel, no management staff, no funds, and insufficient electricity, and with the international market outlook being bearish, blindly introduced outdated equipment from outside and took out loans to build a dehydrated vegetable factory in our township with an annual production capacity of 300 tons. The factory has been in operation for nearly five years, with a cumulative production period of only nine months. Since August 1988, the factory has been shut down and closed, with all technical personnel and workers having left. The 460,000 yuan worth of fixed assets are left unattended. The factory owes 1.04 million yuan in debt, with the interest alone being a significant figure each year. Regarding the future of this factory, our township government has proposed constructive opinions and repeatedly reported to the county government and relevant departments (as the factory's ownership belongs to the county). However, there has been no response so far. The county's self-sufficient finance office has been disbanded, and neither the county finance bureau nor the county government has come up with a plan. The township government lacks the authority to make decisions. Seeing the state's assets being damaged, we, the grassroots cadres and the masses, are truly worried!

    厂停人撤机器生锈　负债百万谁来承担
    我乡地处鄂西北大山区，交通极为不便，每年至少有5个月时间对外交通中断。我乡盛产大蒜。1985年县财政自给办公室在一无技术力量、二无受理人员、三无资金、四缺电力且国际市场行情看跌的情况下，盲目地引进外地过时设备，贷款在我乡兴建一个年生产能力300吨的脱水菜厂。厂建成近5年时间，累计投产仅9个月。自1988年8月停产关门至今，技术人员和工人已全部走光，46万元的固定资产无专人照料。工厂欠债达104万元，光利息每年就是一个可观的数字。关于这个厂的出路，我乡政府提出了建设性的意见，并多次上书请示县政府和有关部门（因此厂产权属县）。但至今无音信。县财政自给办已撤销，县财政局和县府亦未拿出方案，乡政府又无权决策。眼看国家财产受损失，我们基层干部和群众真着急！
