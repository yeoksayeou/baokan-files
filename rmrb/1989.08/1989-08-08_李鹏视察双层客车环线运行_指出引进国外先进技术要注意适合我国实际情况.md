Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 8th.

Premier Li Peng said today that the reform and opening-up policy has greatly advanced China's national economy. Over the past decade, China has primarily relied on self-reliance while actively introducing advanced foreign technologies, significantly improving our economic and technological levels. We must continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening-up.

This afternoon, Li Peng, along with Song Jian, Zhu Jiahua, and Secretary-General of the State Council Luogan, visited the circular test base of the Railway Ministry's Scientific Research Institute to inspect the operation of the double-decker train loop. After riding the double-decker train and electric train set on the circular track, Li Peng and his entourage also visited several new electric and diesel locomotives and passenger and freight vehicles, inquiring in detail about the performance and cost of the equipment. They listened to a report by Railway Minister Li Senmao on the development of China's locomotive and rolling stock industry and the research and development of new products over the past few years.

The 25.5-meter double-decker train recently developed by the Railway Ministry's Puzhen Vehicle Factory and soon to be put into operation is a key project during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The first batch of 12 double-decker trains underwent a series of safety and reliability tests in early March this year. The test results showed that the train's dynamic performance, stability index, and other technical indicators all met the design requirements. Compared to ordinary trains, this double-decker train can increase passenger capacity by more than 50%. The second-generation double-decker train is mainly suitable for medium and short-distance passenger transport needs, with doors, corridors, and staircases arranged to accommodate large volumes of passengers boarding and alighting.

Li Peng said that in recent years, China's locomotive and rolling stock industry has made significant progress, developing many new products, which are also achievements of the reform and opening-up policy.

Li Peng said that in developing industry, we should focus on expanding and technologically upgrading old enterprises, renovating old equipment, introducing new technologies, and adding necessary advanced equipment and testing methods to fully tap the potential of old enterprises. We should avoid building new factories as much as possible, especially avoid low-level duplication. When introducing advanced foreign technologies, we must pay attention to their applicability to China's actual situation. When importing equipment from abroad, we should adhere to the principle of combining technology with trade.

Li Peng pointed out that in developing the manufacturing industry, we must have a holistic view, avoiding both large-scale and small-scale self-sufficiency. We should emphasize professional division of labor and collaborative cooperation. This approach can achieve twice the results with half the effort.

Li Peng said that railways are the lifelines of the country and are crucial to the development of the national economy. In addition to building necessary new lines, we should focus on the renovation and upgrading of railways, adopting new equipment and technologies to ensure the safe operation of railways, so that railways can make greater contributions to the development of the national economy.

Leaders from relevant departments of the State Council were invited to participate in the inspection activity.

    李鹏视察双层客车环线运行
    指出引进国外先进技术要注意适合我国实际情况
    新华社北京8月8日电  （记者陈乃进）国务院总理李鹏今天说，改革开放使我国的国民经济取得很大发展。十年来，我国以自力更生为主，同时积极引进国外先进技术，使我国的经济技术水平取得长足进步，我们必须继续坚持改革开放的方针。
    今天下午，李鹏、宋健、邹家华和国务院秘书长罗干等领导同志到铁道部科学研究院环行试验基地视察双层客车环线运行。李鹏总理一行乘双层客车和电动车组环线运行后，还参观了一些新型电力、内燃机车和客货车辆，详细询问设备的性能、造价等情况，听取了铁道部长李森茂关于几年来我国机车车辆工业的发展和新产品研制情况的汇报。
    最近由铁道部浦镇车辆工厂研制成功并即将投入运营的25.5米双层客车，是国家“七五”期间重点攻关项目，首批12辆1列的双层客车，今年3月上旬进行了一系列安全和可靠性试运试验检测。试验结果表明，列车动力学性能、平稳性指标及其它技术指标都达到了设计任务书规定要求。这种双层客车同一般客车相比，可增加载客50％以上。第二代双层客车主要适用于中短途旅客运输的需要，车门、走廊、楼梯布置，适合大流量旅客上下。
    李鹏说，近几年，我国机车车辆工业取得了很大发展，研制出不少新产品，这些成就也是改革开放取得的成果。
    李鹏说，发展工业，要着重对老企业进行扩建与技术改造，改造老设备，引进新技术和增加必要的先进设备、先进检测手段，充分发挥老企业的潜力，尽量少建新厂，特别应避免低水平的重复。引进国外先进技术要注意适合我国的实际情况，从国外引进设备，要贯彻技贸结合的方针。
    李鹏指出，发展制造工业要有全局观点，不要搞大而全，小而全，要强调专业分工，联合协作。这样做，可以收到事半功倍之效。
    李鹏说，铁路是国家的大动脉，对国民经济的发展十分重要，除了建设必要的新线外，要着重铁路的更新改造，采用新设备与新技术，要确保铁路安全运行，使铁路为国民经济发展做出更大贡献。
    国务院有关部委的负责同志应邀参加了视察活动。
