Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 29th.

The leadership of the Communist Parties in the three Baltic republics of the Soviet Union responded in various ways on the 28th to the statement issued by the CPSU Central Committee regarding the situation there. They emphasized the inseparable relationship between the three republics and the Soviet Union, while also hoping that the international community would understand the local situation.

Recently, large-scale demonstrations took place in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-German pact. Some extremists shouted slogans such as "Down with the CPSU" and "Separate from the Soviet Union." On the 26th, the CPSU Central Committee issued a statement expressing grave concern over the situation in the three republics and calling on local party and government leaders to take measures to stop it.

According to TASS on the 29th, the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party called on the people of the republic to recognize that Lithuania is politically and economically integrated with the Soviet Union. It stated that Lithuania can become a free and sovereign state within the union of equal republics.

The Central Committee of the Latvian Communist Party stated that it remains committed to seeking sovereignty for Latvia within the Soviet Federation and a new status for the Latvian Communist Party as an indivisible part of the CPSU.

The First Secretary of the Estonian Communist Party, Vaino Väljas, stated in a speech that the demand for Estonia to secede from the Soviet Union "can only harm the interests of the Estonian people." At the same time, he hoped for a fundamental transformation of the Soviet Federation and the restoration of Lenin's principles of national self-determination.

On the 29th, Soviet newspapers published responses from the Soviet public to the CPSU Central Committee's statement. The majority of the letters believed that at present, all forces must be united to counter nationalist and extremist elements, to oppose the incitement of national hatred and national estrangement.

Local officials believe that due to the complex situation in the aforementioned three republics, although the party leadership has made statements, the extent to which this will influence the development of the situation remains to be seen.

    苏共中央对三共和国局势声明发表后
    有关各方反应积极
    有人认为事态发展尚待观察
    据新华社莫斯科8月29日电  苏联波罗的海沿岸3个加盟共和国党的领导，28日以不同的方式对苏共中央就那里的形势发表的声明作出反应，既表示这3个加盟共和国与苏维埃联盟有着不可分割的关系，同时希望外界理解那里的局势。
    前不久，在立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚围绕苏德条约签署50周年发生了大规模的示威游行，一些极端分子提出“打倒苏共”和“脱离苏联”等口号。26日，苏共中央发表声明，对这3个共和国的形势表示严重不安，要求当地党政领导采取措施予以制止。
    据塔斯社29日报道，立陶宛党中央全会号召共和国居民要认识到立陶宛无论在政治和经济方面都与苏联结成一体，它“在权利平等的各共和国的联盟中可以成为自由和主权的国家”。
    拉脱维亚共产党中央局表示，它争取拉脱维亚在苏维埃联邦中的主权，争取拉脱维亚共产党——苏共不可分割的一部分——具有新的地位的立场不变。
    爱沙尼亚共产党中央第一书记维亚利亚斯发表讲话表示，提出爱沙尼亚脱离苏联的要求，“只能导致损害爱沙尼亚人民的利益”。同时他希望根本改造苏维埃联邦，恢复列宁关于民族自决的原则。
    29日苏联各报都刊登了苏联群众对苏共中央声明的反应。大多数来信认为，当前必须团结一切力量还击民族主义分子和极端分子，反对挑起民族仇恨和民族隔阂情绪。
    此间人士认为，由于上述3个共和国形势复杂，虽然党的领导作了表态，但究竟对事态的发展有多大影响，尚待观察。
