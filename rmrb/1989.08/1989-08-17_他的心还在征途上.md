On July 21, the news of the passing of Wang Yongjie, the former Party Secretary of the China National Textile Import and Export Corporation, a national model worker in the foreign trade system, and an outstanding Communist Party member of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, spread throughout the company, leaving everyone in deep sorrow. In accordance with his wishes, after the farewell ceremony for his body, the "Long March Cantata" was specially played for him as a send-off. As comrades listened to the unusual melody, scenes of Wang Yongjie working and fighting alongside everyone flashed before their eyes...

Wang Yongjie was a man who faced difficulties head-on. When political work was in vogue, he focused on business; when business was in vogue, he turned to political work. First, he took on the most challenging personnel work, and later, he took on the seemingly even more difficult role of Party Secretary. He had his own explanations: "I just don't believe that ideological and political work has no future. Our cause still needs it. Ideological and political work will one day be respected again."

In 1963, Wang Yongjie graduated from the Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade. In 1965, he was transferred to the China National Textile Import and Export Corporation. Studying foreign trade and working in foreign trade was a natural fit, and Wang Yongjie was happy. He first worked as a businessman in the Silk and Cotton Department for 9 years. Although he did not get to do much foreign trade work during that time, he learned a lot by osmosis, and since he was a graduate of a specialized school, his work was excellent.

Just as he was enjoying his work in the business sector, he was ordered to transfer to the personnel department. In 1974, he was transferred to the Personnel Department, and in 1977, he became the deputy director and then director of the Personnel Department. During this period, social concepts were in turmoil, with right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, progress and backwardness, and personal values being affirmed one moment and denied the next, often catching those doing political work off guard. Wang Yongjie was not an omniscient sage or a wise philosopher. He was also confused and troubled at times, but he always had one principle in mind: seek truth from facts. This principle really helped a lot. He not only gained the trust of the company's employees but was also highly respected. This was a great comfort to Wang Yongjie.

In 1984, Wang Yongjie became the Party Secretary of the company. In this position, he gained the love and respect of the people. The evaluation was: he had no spectacular achievements or earth-shattering deeds, but from his every word and action, we saw the noble qualities of a Communist Party member, the excellent style of a leader, and a sincere heart dedicated to the people.

People called Wang Yongjie an enlightened secretary. The era of reform and opening up naturally required an enlightened secretary, but how to be enlightened was not easy. Wang Yongjie came from a rural background, from elementary school to college, he only knew how to study and serve the country, never thinking about entertainment. Eating, he was satisfied with two meals a day of steamed buns and pickled vegetables. Clothing, even now, he still wears a blue Mao suit. He had no interest in singing or dancing. But as a Party Secretary, he had to understand people, he couldn't call everyone to his side and ask, "Comrade, do you have any problems?" That kind of political work was a mockery of political workers and a destruction of comradeship. Wang Yongjie was not that kind of person. He had no airs and couldn't put on airs. He was always sincere with people. He just felt that with the opening up, people's thoughts were active, and he should keep up. Although he didn't dance, he would attend company-organized activities, watching the young people's joy in dancing disco, he was also happy; listening to those not-so-pure and not-so-pleasant pop songs, he couldn't help but tap his feet along. Wang Yongjie always blended in with his comrades.

Ideological and political work is our advantage. It cannot be said that having ideological and political work and doing it well means having everything, but having it or not is a big difference. Ideological and political work may not directly create foreign exchange, but business is done by businesspeople. If businesspeople have problems, it is inevitable that it will affect foreign exchange earnings. Sometimes, those who oppose or belittle ideological and political work also have to find leaders and secretaries to talk about their problems: family, marriage, promotion, children's education and employment, titles, wages, etc. These are practical problems, and even more so, they are ideological problems. If solved well, everyone will live warmly, comfortably, and smoothly; otherwise, it will make people miserable all day, how can they concentrate on work? The secretary is the yeast that creates a good working environment.

Wang Yongjie said, doing people's work is sometimes more difficult than expected, and traditional ideas cannot understand it. For example, some people came to Wang Yongjie requesting to work abroad, some came to talk about promotion and advancement. These things were unimaginable in the past, but now they are boldly proposed. Are they completely wrong? Not necessarily. Isn't it advocated to recommend oneself? No matter what the situation is, the result is often not achieving the goal, you have to patiently explain to him, do ideological work. If a person has abilities, they should be recognized and seen, but work assignments still need to be considered by the organization according to needs.

People say that now people are not afraid of anything! They want what is theirs, and they also reach for what is not theirs, don't give it for free. The spread of this kind of ideological disease brings pressure and trouble to political workers that outsiders do not fully understand. In 1985, a young man in the company had a love affair breakup and committed a murder. The neighbors of the crime scene were a couple who went to work and immediately found Secretary Wang, claiming that they could not live in this place anymore, they demanded to change their housing, and they were unyielding, rude, and determined not to give up until they achieved their goal. Who doesn't know that housing in Beijing is hard to come by. The China National Textile Import and Export Corporation does big business, if not from them, then from whom, that's the mentality, unreasonable and unyielding. Secretary Wang did not lose his composure as a political worker, he patiently listened to their demands and reasons, remained calm and composed, and treated them sincerely, making them have to give in.

How thorny the matter was, whether it was the divorce of employees, death in the family, handling of violations, or even the lack of unity among cadres, living style, etc., Wang Yongjie treated them all sincerely, insisted on principles, reasoned with them, and moved them with emotion. How many contradictions he resolved with his heart, no one could say for sure, but everyone could mention a few.

Wang Yongjie's integrity was an important factor in gaining the trust of the employees. Wang Yongjie said, what you ask others not to do, you should not do it first; what you ask others to do, you should do it first. This was Wang Yongjie's work principle and also his life creed.

Wang Yongjie did personnel work for 10 years. His wife was weak and often sick, and he had two young children living long-term in the countryside. The difficulties of long-term separation did not affect his work. By 1984, with the help of leaders and comrades, his wife, who had been separated for more than 20 years, was finally transferred to Beijing. His family of four lived in two 20-square-meter rooms. When the company distributed housing, the general manager insisted on giving him a new house or moving him, but he refused. Wang Yongjie said, we were originally separated, and now we are reunited, being able to take care of each other is good enough, the house being small is not a big deal.

Wang Yongjie's two children were in school, his wife was an old patient, and she had no job or income. The whole family relied on his monthly income of over a hundred yuan, life was indeed difficult. His room was very spacious, and a sofa given by his classmate was the most luxurious decoration in the living room. The kitchen table was also given by a classmate. He went to the United States himself and only bought a watch with his pocket money. The 14-inch black-and-white TV was bought after selling the trees and house from his hometown.

Wang Yongjie's hometown often had villagers or old classmates coming to Beijing to find him, hoping to use his position in the headquarters and the influence of the headquarters to gain some benefits or convenience for his hometown. Wang Yongjie always handled things according to regulations and never used his power for personal or hometown benefits.

Wang Yongjie served as the Party Secretary, and according to regulations, he could have a car for official business, but unless the distance was too far, he always tried not to take a car. Whether it was going to a meeting or visiting a patient in the hospital, he mostly walked.

Before Wang Yongjie was officially diagnosed with stomach cancer, he had been in pain for more than a month. During this time, he would start feeling pain around 10 am and again around 4 pm. The pain made him suffer greatly, he would eat some soda crackers and endure it. His wife knew he had stomach pain every day and told him to come home at 5 pm to eat something and relieve the pain, but Wang Yongjie never did that. He always dragged his tired body home very late, until the day before he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, Wang Yongjie was still insisting on working.

Wang Yongjie was so poor and so strict with himself for the sake of his work, and in front of his work objects, he spoke with confidence, more importantly, he had no demands on life, he understood life as bringing favorable conditions for his work. Wang Yongjie said, now it is advocated that a part of the people should get rich first, I agree, but I do not agree that Communist Party members should get rich first, Communist Party members should let the people get rich first, the proletariat can only liberate itself after liberating all mankind. He also said, I do not agree with being poor, we cannot be too poor, it was too poor before liberation, but for me personally, I am satisfied with enough to eat and wear.

Now is the era of opening up, many people want to go abroad, most people want to achieve something, but there are also a few who want to go abroad to make a fortune. Who comes back from abroad without bringing back one or two items? But Wang Yongjie gave up doing business work and willingly did personnel work with fewer opportunities to go abroad. The organization wanted to take care of him to go abroad, but he said it was not his division of work, and it was not a work need, so he did not accept it. Wang Yongjie's spirit of strict self-discipline was deeply respected by everyone.

On July 3, 1987, Wang Yongjie had to go to the hospital for a check-up. It was found that there were polyps in his stomach. Wang Yongjie, who was knowledgeable about medicine, immediately understood: what he thought was a duodenal ulcer was actually stomach cancer. The blow to Wang Yongjie at that time was enormous. He hid it from his wife, endured it, and returned home. Seeing his wife lying in bed crying, he asked her what happened? His lifelong companion hid from her husband that nothing was wrong, just afraid he was in pain. What else was there to say? The feelings between husband and wife were thus silently communicated.

Wang Yongjie, suffering from a terminal illness, thought that he could not go to work in the short term, so he proactively wrote a letter to the department leaders: "I am scheduled to have surgery on July 10, and it seems that I cannot go to work for a short period. Considering that our textile import and export company has heavy tasks and busy work, the leadership team has a limited number of members, in order not to affect the work, I cannot continue to hold this position. I hope the leadership will not consider me too much because of my illness, which may cause me psychological pressure. I think as long as the various tasks of our textile import and export company can be well completed, and the honor of an advanced enterprise can be continued, this will be a greater comfort to me."

Comrades read this letter and were all moved by his noble and selfless character, their eyes blurred, and their throats choked up. Comrades from the bottom of their hearts wished him a speedy recovery.

However, the disease eventually took Wang Yongjie's life. On July 29, the leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the employees of the China National Textile Import and Export Corporation, and the comrades of the foreign trade system bid a silent farewell to this outstanding political worker with tears in their eyes. People missed him, people respected him, and people were proud of such a true Communist Party member.

    他的心还在征途上
    周继胜
    7月21日，中国纺织品进出口总公司原党委书记、全国对外经贸系统劳动模范、经贸部优秀共产党员王永杰逝世的消息传来，公司上下无不悲痛。遵照他的遗愿，在向他遗体告别仪式后，专门为他播放了《长征组歌》，为他送行。同志们听着那不同寻常的旋律，王永杰与大家一起工作、战斗的情景历历在目……
    王永杰是一个迎着困难走的人。搞政治吃香的时候，他在搞业务；搞业务吃香的时候，他却又去搞政治，先是做了最让人头痛的人事工作，而后又担任那个似乎更难的党委书记工作。对于这些，他有自己的解释：我就不相信思想政治工作就没有出路，我们的事业就不需要了？思想政治工作总有一天会重新受到尊重的。
    1963年，王永杰同志从北京外贸学院毕业，1965年王永杰调到中国纺织品进出口总公司工作。学的是外贸，做的是外贸，顺理成章，专业对口，王永杰很高兴。他先是在纱布处做了9年的业务员。虽然那段时间并没有能够正经去做外贸工作，但耳濡目染，再加上又是科班出身，工作自然是没得说。
    正当他在业务岗位上干得欢的时候，却奉命调到人事部门工作。1974年，他调到人事处，1977年后又任人事处副处长、处长。这个时期社会观念在激烈动荡，是非观、美丑观、先进落后观、人生价值观，一会儿肯定、一会儿否定，弄得做政治工作的人常常是措手不及。王永杰不是一个全能的智者，也不是先哲圣人。他也迷糊过，也苦恼过，但是他心里总有一条：实事求是。这一条可真帮了大忙，他不但受到公司职工的信赖，还颇受敬重。这对王永杰来说是莫大的安慰。
    1984年，王永杰任公司党委书记。在这个位子上，他得到了人们的爱戴、亲近。得到的评价是：他既没有什么轰轰烈烈的业绩，也没有什么惊天动地的壮举，然而从他的一言一行中我们看到了一个共产党员的高尚品质，看到了一个领导干部的优良作风，看到了一颗跳动着的对人民负责的赤诚之心。
    人们称王永杰为开明书记。开放时代自然要当开明书记，但是如何开明却很难。王永杰出身农村，从小学中学到大学，只知道读书报国，从没有想到玩乐。吃，一天两顿饭，窝头咸菜，已经很满足了。穿，直到现在还是一身蓝布中山装。唱歌、跳舞更无爱好。可当党委书记，要了解人，总不能一个一个叫到身边问：“同志呀，你有什么思想问题啊？”那样的思想政治工作是对政工工作者的讽刺，是对同志之间关系的破坏。王永杰不是这样的人，他没有架子也摆不了架子，他待人一向诚恳。他只是觉得开放了，人们思想活跃，自己应该跟上。虽然自己不跳舞，但公司组织活动，他都要到场，看看青年们跳迪斯科那高兴劲儿，自己也高兴；听听那些唱来音色不够纯正也不悦耳的流行歌曲，他也不禁跟着打拍子。王永杰永远和他的同志们融为一体。
    思想政治工作是我们的优势。虽不能说有了思想政治工作，做好了思想政治工作就有了一切，但有没有绝对是两回事。思想政治工作乍看起来并不直接创汇，但是业务是由业务人员去做的，业务员思想有了问题，就难免影响出口创汇工作。有时候就是那些反对思想政治工作或轻视思想政治工作的人，自己也不得不找领导、书记谈谈自己的问题：家庭、婚姻、晋级、子女升学就业、职称、工资……等等。这些是实际问题，更多的是思想问题，解决得好，大家就生活得温暖、舒心、顺气，否则就令人整日苦恼，哪里还谈得上一心工作？书记是创造良好工作环境的酵母。
    王永杰说，做人的工作难度有时是想不到的，用我们传统的思想更无法理解。比如有的人找到王永杰要求出国工作，有的来谈话要求晋级、提拔，这些事过去是不可想象的，可是现在大大方方地提出来了。完全不对吗？也不尽然。不是提倡毛遂自荐吗？无论是哪一种情况，结果总有不能达到目的的，你就要耐着性子向他解释，做好思想工作。个人有能力固然应当承认、看到，但工作分配还要根据需要由组织统一考虑。
    人们都说现在的人都不懔了！是自己的要，不是自己的也伸手，不要白不要。这种思想病的流行，给政工工作者带来的压力和麻烦是外人不大了解的。1985年，公司一个青年谈恋爱破裂，发生了凶杀事件。凶杀现场的邻居是一对夫妇，一上班就找到王书记，声称这个地方不能住了，他们要求调换住房，而且不依不饶，出言不逊，大有不达目的不罢休的劲头。谁不知道北京的房子难弄。纺织品进出口公司是做大生意的，不揩它的揩谁的，就是这么个心理，蛮横不讲理地纠缠。王书记不失政工工作者的涵养和身份，他耐心地听取他们的要求和理由后，镇定自若，和颜悦色，以理服人，诚恳待人，弄得对方不得不服了气。
    多么棘手的事，职工婚变、家中死人，处理违章事件，甚至于干部间不团结、生活作风等，王永杰都诚恳相待，坚持原则，晓之以理，动之以情。他以他的心化解了多少矛盾，谁也说不清，可是谁都能说出几件来。
    王永杰一身正气是他赢得职工信任的一个重要因素。王永杰说，要求别人不做的，首先自己不做，要求别人做的，首先自己做到。这是王永杰工作的准则，也是他生活的信条。
    王永杰做人事工作10年。妻子体弱多病，带着两个幼小的孩子长期在农村居住。长期分居的困难并没有影响他的工作。到1984年，在领导和同志们的帮助下，才把分居20多年的妻子调到北京。他一家四口住在两间20平方米的平房内。公司分房时，总经理坚持要给他分新房或调房，他坚持不肯。王永杰说，我们原来分居，现在团聚了，能互相照顾就很好，房子小点没有什么关系。
    王永杰两个孩子在上学，妻子又是老病号，而且没有工作，没有收入，全家只靠他一月百余元的收入，生活的确困难。他的房间里显得很空旷，他的同学送他一对沙发算是客厅里最排场的摆设了，连厨房吃饭桌子也是同学送的。他自己去美国，只用零用钱买回一块手表，14英寸黑白电视机还是卖了老家的树和房子才买上的。
    王永杰老家经常有老乡或老同学来京找他，希望能利用他在总公司的地位和总公司所具有的权力或影响，为家乡谋得一些好处或业务上的便利。王永杰总是公事公办，从不以自己手中的权力为个人和家乡亲友开方便之门。
    王永杰担任党委书记，按规定因公外出完全可以要车，但不是因为路程太远，他总是尽可能的不要车，不管外出开会，还是到医院看病号，他多数是步行走着去。
    正式查出王永杰胃癌之前，他已胃疼1个多月了。这段时间里，他每天上午10点来钟就开始疼，下午4点来钟又疼一次。疼痛使他痛苦不堪，他吃些苏打饼干硬挺着。他妻子知道他每天胃疼，嘱咐他5点下班就赶快回家，吃一些东西，缓解一下，但是王永杰从来做不到这一点，他每天都是拖着疲惫的身体很晚才回到家，直到查出胃癌的前一天，王永杰还在坚持工作。
    王永杰如此清贫，如此严格要求自己是为了工作，在自己的工作对象面前说话理直气壮，更重要的是他对生活本来无所求，他对生活的理解是要为他的工作带来有利条件。王永杰说，现在号召一部分人先富起来，我赞成，但不赞成共产党员先富，共产党员要让老百姓先富，无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己嘛。他还说，我不赞成穷，我们不能太苦了，解放前就是太苦了，但就我个人来说，我够吃够穿就行了。
    如今是开放的年代，很多人都想往外跑，多数人是要干一番事业的，但也确有少数人是想到海外捞世界的。哪一个出国回来不带个一件两件的呢？可是王永杰放着业务工作不干，心甘情愿地做出国机会很少的人事工作。组织上要照顾他出国，他表示不是自己分管的工作，不是工作需要没有接受。王永杰的这种严于律己的精神深得人们的敬重。
    1987年7月3日，王永杰不得已到医院检查，经查，胃里有息肉。富有医学常识的王永杰心里一下子全明白了：原来以为是十二指肠溃疡的毛病，原来是胃癌。当时给王永杰的打击是巨大的。他瞒着妻子，硬撑着回到家中，看到妻子躺在床上哭，就问她怎么回事了？相依为命的老伴瞒着丈夫说没什么，就是怕你疼。还有什么说的呢？夫妻的感情就这样彼此默默地交流了。
    王永杰身患绝症想到自己不可能在短期内上班工作，就主动给部领导写信：7月10日就要给我动手术了，看来短时间内不能上班工作了，考虑到我们纺织品公司任务重，工作忙，领导班子编制有限，为不影响工作，我不能再占着位置，请求免去我的职务。希望领导不要更多地考虑我有病，会不会给我造成思想负担，我想只要我们纺织品公司各项任务能很好地完成，先进企业的荣誉能够继续保持下去，这对我来说是更大的安慰。
    同志们看了这封信，都被他那高尚无私的品德所震撼，眼睛模糊了，嗓子哽咽了。同志们从心底里祝愿他早日康复。
    然而，疾病还是夺去了王永杰的生命。7月29日，经贸部领导、纺织品进出口公司职工和经贸系统的同志，含着热泪向这位优秀的政治工作者默默告别。人们怀念他，人们敬重他，人们为这样一位真正的共产党人感到自豪。
