In the Yiwu Military Horse Farm, a girl named Ping from the Hami Military District Propaganda Department asked me, "There's a place nearby called the Singing Sands Hill, one of the Eight Scenic Views of Barki. Would you like to go see it?"

Indeed, ahead of us was a vast expanse of sand dunes undulating like waves under the sun, their curves soft and graceful like a woman's body. I had only heard of the Singing Sands Mountain in Dunhuang and the Crescent Moon Spring, but never had the chance to see them. Climbing the Singing Sands Mountain in Barki, Xinjiang, wouldn't be so bad.

It was the season of melting snow. A Beijing Jeep drove us in a large circle through the grassy plain and dropped us off at the foot of the mountain.

Walking through the sand, each step left a footprint. After a few steps, looking back, the footprints seemed to stretch back through the years to my feet.

Sand filled my shoes, making each step heavier. I took off my shoes and climbed the mountain barefoot. The sand mountain looked high and steep, but it was very inviting, making me want to climb to the top to see the other side of the sand dunes...

Ping was a girl who grew up in a border defense camp in Barki. She told me that beneath the sand mountain lies an ancient legend: Long ago, Lady Fenglilua led a troop of female soldiers westward, and when they camped at the foot of the Singing Sands Mountain, a strange wind blew, burying the entire troop of women under the endless sands. Now, when the sand moves, you can hear the sound of jingling bells and ornaments... This legend was both cruel and beautiful, deeply captivating me. I quickly climbed to the top of a sand dune, stomped my feet, and pressed my ear to the sand. Unfortunately, I heard nothing. The sand dunes were silent. The sand was still wet from the melting snow. I was told that in the summer and autumn, the sound of the shifting sand has a metallic quality. If a strong wind blows, the sound is not like bells, but like the wailing of ghosts and howling of wolves, chilling to the bone.

The soft, fine, and clean sand dunes made me lose myself. I slid down the sand slope, rolled around on it, pressed my face gently against the sand, and then flipped over to stretch out in the sand, arms and legs spread wide. I scooped up handfuls of sand and felt the fine grains slip through my fingers... The pure sand mountain took me back to my childhood.

After climbing over a high sand dune, I heard Ping shout, "Look, the Lake of Illusions."

The Lake of Illusions, what a poetic name. At the foot of the mountain, there was indeed a grove of shrubs, and beside it, a small pool of water. Surrounded by sand dunes, the grove and the pool lay quietly in the embrace of the sand mountains. Neither dry nor disappearing, it was truly a miracle close to illusion! No wonder people gave it such a wonderful name.

That small grove of trees and the pool of water truly excited me! Lake of Illusions, you are not an illusion, you are reality. You live in the vast sea of sand, although the surrounding sand has imprisoned your body, it cannot imprison your illusions, nor can it make you bow or submit. You are the god of hope, you are willpower, you are strength. You show the tenacity and resilience of life.

Am I not also full of life?

Look at that grove of trees and the pool of water. Don't always complain; see the beauty of life and the greatness of life. I said this to myself in my heart.

    鸣沙山与幻想湖
    张际会
    在伊吾军马场，哈密军分区宣传科的萍姑娘问我：附近有沙坡鸣钟，是巴里坤八景之一，不去看看？
    前方果然有一片波浪般起伏的沙丘，在阳光里呈现着女性躯体般优美柔和的曲线。原只知敦煌有鸣沙山，有月牙泉，但无缘一睹。能爬爬新疆巴里坤的鸣沙山，倒也不坏。
    正是化雪季节，北京吉普在大草甸中绕了很大一圈，将我们送至山脚。
    沙中跋涉，一步一脚印。走几步一回头，脚印便岁月般通至脚下。
    鞋中灌满流沙，脚下越来越沉。干脆脱了鞋赤脚爬山。沙山看上去高而且陡，但极富诱惑，总想攀到山顶去看看那边的沙坡……
    萍姑娘是在巴里坤的边防军营中长大的孩子。她告诉我，沙山下埋着一个悠远的传说：当年樊梨花带一支女兵队伍征西，夜宿鸣沙山下，不料妖风刮来，一营女兵全埋在了漫漫流沙之下。如今流沙一动，就会听到叮当环珮之声……这传说有点残酷的美，深深地诱惑了我。我快步爬上一个山头，脚蹬手刨再把耳朵贴近沙面，很遗憾，我什么也没听见。沙坡是不鸣的。刚化完雪沙子潮湿。听说夏秋时节流沙的声音颇有金属感因为倘若刮起狂风，那声音已不是鸣钟，而是鬼哭狼嚎一般地瘆人了。
    柔和、细腻、洁净的沙坡，让我有些忘情。顺着流沙地滑，在沙坡上打滚，我把面孔静静贴于沙面，又翻转身在沙里四仰八叉地舒展身子，双手捧起沙来再细细体会指缝间酥酥的流感……纯洁的沙山使我回到了孩童。
    翻过一个高高的山头，只听萍姑娘喊一声：“瞧，幻想湖。”
    幻想湖，多富诗意的名字。山脚下果然有一片灌木林，丛林边有一片不大的水泊。四周沙山环绕，丛林和水泊就恬静地伏卧在沙山的怀抱。不干涸不消亡，真是一个近于幻想的奇迹！难怪人们送它这么一个美妙的名字。
    那片小树林和水泊真使我激动了！幻想湖，你不是幻想，你是现实。你生活在洪流的沙海里，虽然四野流沙囚禁了你的身躯，却囚不住你的幻想，更不能使你折腰、屈从。你是希望之神，你是意志，是力，你昭示的是生命的顽强和坚韧。
    我不是也具有生命的么？
    看看那片树吧，还有那水泊。不要老是埋怨，要看到生活的美好和生命的伟大。我这样自言自语，在心里。
