	Huangdao Oil Port, which had suspended operations for five days due to a fire at the Huangdao Oil Depot, resumed production at 17:35 today. The port began loading crude oil onto the Congo, a Liberian-registered oil tanker with a capacity of 60,000 tons, which was docked at the eastern berth of the upper wharf. With this, Huangdao Oil Port's production has officially resumed.
