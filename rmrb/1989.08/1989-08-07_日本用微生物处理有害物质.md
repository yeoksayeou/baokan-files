Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies has recently successfully developed a new method using microorganisms to treat high-tech pollutants.

According to the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, the new method involves cultivating microorganisms on the surface of activated carbon to decompose harmful substances, which is much more efficient than previous microbial treatment methods. The specific process is to introduce aerobic bacteria into the wastewater along with air, allowing them to proliferate on the surface of activated carbon. When water containing harmful substances such as trichloroethylene and chlorinated compounds flows to the surface of the activated carbon, these hard-to-decompose substances are adsorbed by the activated carbon. The aerobic bacteria then decompose the harmful substances. This method can simultaneously treat multiple harmful substances in the wastewater.

    日本用微生物处理有害物质
    新华社东京8月7日电　日本国立公害研究所最近研究成功用微生物处理高技术污染物质的新方法。
    据《日经产业新闻》报道，新方法是让微生物在活性碳表面繁殖来分解有害物质，它比过去的微生物处理法效率要高得多。具体作法是让向排放的污水中送入空气的好气菌在活性碳表面繁殖，当含有三氯乙烯和氯基化合物等有害物质的水流到活性碳表面时，这些难以分解的物质就被活性碳吸附，然后通过好气菌的作用将有害物质分解。采用这种方法，排水中有多种有害物质也能够同时处理。
