Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 9th.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karpov said in a commentary to a Tass reporter on August 9th that there are severe disagreements in the Soviet-American nuclear weapons and space weapons talks in Geneva.

Karpov pointed out that the disagreements mainly lie in the following two aspects:

	— The sea-based cruise missiles remain a stumbling block in the talks. The U.S. side opposes using a treaty to restrict them, and only suggests making a legally non-binding declaration. If the Soviet Union agrees to this suggestion, the U.S. side can increase sea-based cruise missiles without any restrictions.

	— Regarding air-based cruise missiles, the disagreements are still concentrated on the issue of how to calculate them: whether to calculate based on the actual number of heavy bombers equipped, or to stipulate their quantity.

    苏联副外长发表评论指出
    苏美核谈判分歧严重
    据新华社莫斯科8月9日电　苏联外交部副部长卡尔波夫9日对塔斯社记者发表评论表示，苏美日内瓦核武器和太空武器谈判存在着严重分歧。
    卡尔波夫指出，谈判分歧主要在以下两个方面：
    ——海基巡航导弹仍是谈判中的绊脚石，美方反对用条约来限制，只建议作出法律上不受约束的声明。如果苏联同意这一建议，美方就可以不受限制地随意增加海基巡航导弹。
    ——在空基巡航导弹方面，分歧仍然集中在如何计算问题上：是按实际装备的重型轰炸机来计算，还是规定其数量。
