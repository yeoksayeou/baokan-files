Recently, I read several articles in your newspaper calling for strengthened prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in our country, and I found them to be very pertinent. As a medical worker, I feel that the potential dangers within the medical and health departments must be addressed. For example:

1. The practice of using unsterilized needles and syringes is common in rural areas and even in some urban hospitals. Using the same syringe for skin tests with penicillin and tuberculin, changing only the needle, has been proven to cause infections in clinical settings.

2. Currently, the most widely used sterilization method in our country is high-pressure steam sterilization. However, a survey report indicates that the sterilization pass rate is only 42.9%.

3. There are many issues with chemical disinfection in clinical settings. Frequently used disinfectants themselves often contain bacteria and hepatitis B surface antigens. According to statistics, the pass rate for sold disinfectants is 55.97%, with iodine tincture at 52.4% and alcohol at 44.51%.

4. In many hospitals, the same test tubes and slides are used for multiple patients during routine blood tests, and the sterilization and disinfection in dental clinics need urgent improvement.

5. The sterilization and disinfection quality in individual medical practices and primary health stations is even worse, making them the most important sites for hospital-acquired infections.

6. In the barber and beauty industry, instruments are often shared among multiple people, leading to severe contamination with almost no management in place.

    谨防医源性传染
    最近读了贵报几篇呼吁加强我国传染病防治的文章，深感切中时弊。我是医务工作者，对医疗卫生部门内的潜在危险也感非抓不可。如：
    一、不经消毒共用针头针管的现象，在农村甚至城市的部分医院多有存在。做青、链霉素皮试和结核菌素实验，只换针头不换针管，临床证明是可以造成感染的。
    二、目前我国最主要的消毒灭菌方法——高压蒸汽灭菌法，有调查报告显示：灭菌合格率仅为42.9％。
    三、临床化学消毒问题多。经常使用的消毒液本身含有细菌和乙肝表面抗原。据统计，出售的消毒液的合格率为55.97％，其中碘酒合格率52.4％，酒精为44.51％。
    四、许多医院血常规化验时吸管、玻片多人共用，口腔科的灭菌消毒更急需改进。
    五、个体行医者和基层卫生站的消毒灭菌质量更差，是医源传染最重要的场所。
    六、理发美容业器械多人共用，污染严重而几乎没有管理。
