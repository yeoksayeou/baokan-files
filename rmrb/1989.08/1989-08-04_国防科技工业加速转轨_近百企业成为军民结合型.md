Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 4th — (Reporter Xǔ Zhìmǐn) Nearly 100 defense industry enterprises across the country have undergone key technological transformations, initially establishing military-civilian integration-type enterprises that can produce both advanced weaponry and civilian products.

According to relevant departments of the State Planning Commission, this is part of the 126 key technological transformation projects for defense industry enterprises approved by the State Council and the Central Military Commission in 1986. The transformation plans have made significant adjustments to the technology and equipment of defense industry enterprises, enabling the transformed enterprises to have two sets of capabilities: producing civilian products needed for national economic development in peacetime and rapidly switching to military production in wartime. Military and civilian sectors mutually promote each other, further leveraging the advantages of defense industries.

Currently, enterprises that have completed technological transformations have produced a batch of new civilian products, including air-jet spinning machines, refrigerator compressors, and microcars, gradually replacing imported similar products, with some even entering the international market. At the same time, they have provided nearly 100 types of advanced technological equipment for the energy, transportation, and raw materials sectors. According to relevant departments, the input-output ratio of these enterprises' technological transformations is on average above 1:4, with economic benefits approximately 100% higher than those of domestic similar machinery industries. Compared to newly built production lines of the same scale, investments are saved by nearly half, and construction periods are shortened by one to two years.

    国防科技工业加速转轨
    近百企业成为军民结合型
    据新华社北京8月4日电　（记者许志敏）全国近百家军工企业经过重点技术改造，初步建成既可制造先进武器装备，又能生产民用产品的军民结合型企业。
    据国家计委有关部门介绍，这是1986年国务院、中央军委批准的126项军工企业重点技术改造项目中的一部分。这批改造计划对军工企业的技术设备和产品结构作了较大调整，使改造后的企业具备两套本领，平时能生产国民经济发展需要的民用产品，战时能迅速转产军品。军民互相促进，军工优势进一步得到发挥。
    目前，完成技术改造的企业已生产出气流纺纱机、电冰箱压缩机、微型汽车等一批民用新产品，逐步取代了进口的同类产品，有的还打入了国际市场。同时，为能源、交通、原材料等部门提供了近百种先进技术装备。据有关部门测算，这批企业技术改造的投入产出比平均在1∶4以上，经济效益比国内同类机械行业高1倍左右。与新建同样规模的生产线相比，投资节省近一半，工期缩短一至两年。
