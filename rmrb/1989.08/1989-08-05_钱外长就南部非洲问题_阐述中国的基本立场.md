Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today held a press conference at the Harare International Conference Center, where he discussed the current situation in Southern Africa and China's basic stance on resolving issues in the region.

Qian said that he was visiting Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique at the invitation of these six countries. The situation in Southern Africa is undergoing positive changes, with a growing trend towards reconciliation and a brighter prospect for peace. He took this opportunity to share his views on the situation in the region and China's basic stance on resolving its issues:

1. The shift from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue in Southern Africa is the result of long-term struggles by the people, frontline states, and the broader international community, including other African countries. Today, Southern African countries and their people continue to seek solutions through negotiations, dialogues, and other means, making the prospect of peace even more encouraging. However, it should be noted that relaxation does not mean complete peace. The factors causing regional tension and instability have not been eliminated. Economic issues are becoming more prominent. The struggle against control and counter-control, threats and counter-threats, subversion and counter-subversion continues. The struggle to achieve lasting peace and stability in Southern Africa is arduous and requires sustained efforts. The Chinese government and people highly appreciate the efforts of the Southern African people to seek political solutions to regional problems and will continue to firmly support their correct policies and strategies based on the actual situation in their countries and the region.

2. To achieve peace, stability, development, and prosperity in Southern Africa, the most crucial step is to completely eliminate the root cause of the region's instability—the apartheid system in South Africa. Under the firm struggle of the South African people and the strong pressure of the international community, the South African authorities have made some changes in their domestic and foreign policies. However, they have not taken substantial measures on the fundamental issue of abolishing the apartheid system. We strongly urge the South African authorities to recognize the situation, follow the historical trend, adopt an enlightened policy, announce the abolition of the apartheid system and all laws and decrees of racial discrimination, immediately and unconditionally release South African black leader Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, recognize the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress and other national liberation organizations, and engage in dialogue with them to establish a united, democratic, free, and racially equal South Africa.

3. The issue of Namibian independence has long been a major problem in the situation in Southern Africa and a major concern for the international community, especially African countries. We are pleased to see that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, after being passed 10 years ago, finally came into effect on April 1 this year. The start of Namibia's independence process marks the imminent completion of Africa's historic mission of decolonization. The Chinese people are delighted by this historic change. Currently, Namibia has entered a new phase of preparing for elections. We believe that the successful holding of free and fair elections in Namibia and its timely independence are both the sacred rights that the Namibian people should enjoy and the objective requirements of the peace and development cause in Southern Africa. We hope that all parties concerned with the Namibian issue, especially the South African authorities, will keep their promises and fulfill their obligations, and will not take any actions that disrupt the fairness and freedom of Namibia's elections or any actions that are not conducive to Namibia's timely independence. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China will continue to play an active role in ensuring Namibia's timely independence. China will respect the choice of the Namibian people, and as long as the elections are free and fair, China will discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations with the government of Namibia that emerges from the elections on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

4. Development is a major issue facing Southern Africa. The establishment of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference has made collective efforts to revitalize the regional economy and break free from South African control. We hope that the international community, especially developed countries, will adopt wise and far-sighted policies and take effective measures to improve the external environment that seriously hinders African economic development and provide active support and sufficient aid to Southern African countries. China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity and, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, consolidate and develop friendly cooperative relations with them.

Qian Qichen concluded by saying, "We are confident that, through their own persistent efforts and with the close coordination and strong support of the international community, the people of Southern Africa will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and ultimately achieve the complete eradication of racism and the final victory of regional peace and development."

    钱外长就南部非洲问题
    阐述中国的基本立场
    新华社哈拉雷8月4日电  正在这里访问的中国外交部长钱其琛今天下午在哈拉雷国际会议中心举行的记者招待会上，就当前的南部非洲局势及中国对解决这一地区问题的基本主张发表了4点声明。
    钱其琛说，他此次应邀出访博茨瓦纳、莱索托、津巴布韦、安哥拉、赞比亚和莫桑比克6国，正值南部非洲地区的形势出现了积极的变化，和解势头逐渐增强，和平前景日趋明朗。他愿借此机会简要谈谈对这一地区形势的看法和对解决这一地区问题的基本主张：
    一、南部非洲地区形势从紧张转向缓和，从对抗转向对话，是这一地区人民、前线国家和包括其他非洲国家在内的广大国际社会长期斗争的结果。今天，南部非洲国家和人民在继续通过谈判对话等多种方式解决地区有关问题，和平前景更加令人鼓舞。但是，应当指出，缓和并不意味天下太平。导致地区紧张、动荡的各种因素并未消除。经济问题更加突出。控制与反控制、威胁与反威胁、颠覆与反颠覆的斗争仍在继续。争取实现南部非洲地区持久和平与稳定的斗争是艰巨的，还需要坚持不懈的努力。中国政府和人民高度赞赏南部非洲人民谋求政治解决地区问题的努力，并将一如既往坚决支持它们根据本国和本地区实际而采取的正确的政策和策略。
    二、要实现南部非洲的和平、稳定、发展、繁荣，最关键的就是必须彻底铲除这一地区动荡的最大根源——南非的种族隔离制度。在南非人民坚决斗争和国际社会的强大压力下，南非当局的内外政策作法有了某些变化。但是在废除种族隔离制度这个根本问题上，它并未采取实质性的政策和措施。我们强烈呼吁南非当局认清形势，顺应历史潮流，采取开明政策，宣布废除种族隔离制度和一切种族歧视法律和法令，并立即无条件释放南非黑人领袖纳尔逊·曼德拉和其他政治犯，承认南非非洲人国民大会和泛非主义者大会等民族解放组织，并与它们就建立一个统一、民主、自由和种族平等的南非进行对话。
    三、纳米比亚独立问题一直是南部非洲地区形势中的一个主要问题，也是国际社会特别是非洲各国关注的一个主要问题。我们高兴地看到，联合国安理会435号决议在通过10年之后终于在今年4月1日起得以实施。纳米比亚独立进程的开始，标志着非洲大陆即将胜利完成非殖民化的历史使命。对于这一具有历史意义的变化，中国人民感到欢欣鼓舞。目前，纳米比亚进入了大选准备工作的新阶段。我们认为，纳米比亚顺利举行自由、公正的大选、按期实现独立，既是纳米比亚人民应当享有的神圣权利，也是南部非洲和平与发展事业的客观要求。我们希望纳米比亚问题的有关各方，特别是南非当局，信守诺言，认真履约，不要采取破坏纳米比亚大选的公正自由，以及一切不利于纳米比亚如期独立的行动。中国作为联合国安理会常任理事国，将一如既往，继续为纳米比亚如期实现独立而发挥积极的作用。中国将尊重纳米比亚人民的选择，只要大选是自由和公正的，中国将同大选产生的纳米比亚政府在和平共处五项原则的基础上商谈建立邦交事宜。
    四、发展问题是南部非洲地区面临的一个重要问题。南部非洲发展协调会议的建立，为振兴地区经济，摆脱南非的控制，进行了集体的努力。我们希望国际社会，特别是发达国家采取明智而有远见的政策和切实有效的措施，改善严重阻碍非洲经济发展的外部环境，并向南部非洲国家提供积极的支持和充分援助。中国将继续在力所能及的范围内，向它们提供援助，并在平等互利的基础上，巩固和发展同它们的友好合作关系。
    钱其琛最后说，我们深信，南部非洲各国人民经过自己坚持不懈的努力，并在国际社会的密切配合和大力支持下，一定能够战胜一切艰难险阻，赢得彻底根除种族主义和实现地区和平与发展的最终胜利。
