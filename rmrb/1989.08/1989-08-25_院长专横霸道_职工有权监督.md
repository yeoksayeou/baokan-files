The Director's Arbitrary and Tyrannical Behavior: Workers Have the Right to Supervise

At the recent second session of the first Sichuan Petroleum Administration Bureau Workers' Congress, worker representatives exercised their supervisory rights to expose and criticize the arbitrary and tyrannical behavior of the director of the bureau's Second Workers' Hospital, Cong Jindao.

As the director, Cong Jindao should treat people with courtesy and equality. However, he frequently insults the masses. He calls one person a "shrew" and "stinking bitch," and another a "son of a bitch" and "son of a dog." The masses call him the "king of insults." In his work, Cong Jindao acts unilaterally and arbitrarily. Matters affecting the masses' immediate interests, such as salary adjustments, housing allocation, and rewards, are all decided by him alone. The masses call this phenomenon "workers are the masters, but the director is the boss." Cong Jindao withdrew 7,967 yuan from the Labor Service Company and decided to distribute "little red envelopes" to the section heads himself. He gave 350 yuan each to two officials, while the rest received only 20 to 100 yuan. Even the director's own bonus coefficient was determined by him: 1 for the director, 0.8 for the secretary and deputy director, and 0.6 for the union chairman and disciplinary committee secretary. In 1988, Cong Jindao received the highest contract bonus of 1,923 yuan for the entire hospital, while ordinary workers received only about 100 yuan. Why such a large disparity? Cong Jindao said, "The purpose is to improve the value orientation of enterprise managers."

When workers gave Cong Jindao suggestions or reported his problems to higher authorities, he retaliated. Administrative staff member He Xingquan exposed a problem where Cong Jindao altered an epidemic prevention station sewage treatment inspection report to fraudulently obtain an honor. Instead of investigating, Cong Jindao insulted He Xingquan and immediately removed him from his position as administrative staff member. Former personnel department head Liu Deguang resisted Cong Jindao's nepotistic personnel policy, and Cong demoted him from his position without approval from the bureau. Cashier Zhang Dengxing from the Labor Service Company was demoted by Cong Jindao for exposing the problem of Cong Jindao transferring funds and violating financial discipline.

Because Cong Jindao is unpopular, the representatives of the Workers' Congress demanded his removal from the position of director.

    院长专横霸道　职工有权监督
    在最近举行的四川石油管理局首届二次职工代表大会上，职工代表行使监督权，对该局第二职工医院院长丛金道的专横霸道作风进行揭发和批评。
    丛金道身为院长，理应礼貌平等待人，可是他动不动就辱骂群众，这个是“泼妇”、“臭娘们”，那个是“王八蛋”、“狗娘养的”，群众称他是“骂人大王”。工作上，丛金道独断专行，涉及到群众切身利益的调资、分房、奖励等事情，都由他一人说了算，群众把这种现象叫“职工当家，院长作主”。丛金道从劳动服务公司提款7967元，由他一人决定给科室干部发“小红包”。他给两个干部各发350元，其余的仅20元至100元。就连院长自己的奖金系数也由他圈定：院长为1，书记和副院长0.8，工会主席和纪委书记0.6。1988年丛金道拿到全院最高承包奖1923元，而一般职工有的仅得到100元左右。为什么要如此悬殊？丛金道说：“目的是提高企业管理者的价值取向。”
    职工们给丛提意见，向上级反映他的问题，他便报复。院行政股长何兴全向他揭露一件涂改防疫站污水处理检验单骗取荣誉的问题，丛金道不仅不查询，还辱骂何兴全并立即撤销了他行政股长的职务。原干部科长刘德光由于抵制丛金道的任人唯亲的干部政策，丛不经局的批准就免了他的干部科长。劳动服务公司出纳员张登兴，因揭露丛金道转移资金，违犯财经纪律的问题，也被丛金道给撤了。
    由于丛金道不得人心，职代会的代表要求免去他院长职务。
