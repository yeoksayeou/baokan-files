Recently, the trend of compiling and publishing biographical dictionaries and collections of reportage on entrepreneurs, engineers, teachers, and other notable figures has become quite fashionable. My unit receives one or two letters a month or hosts one or two visits from such individuals. They all have one additional condition: they request sponsorship. The amount ranges from a few dozen yuan to several thousand yuan. Some members of the editorial board even have significant influence. If the enterprise does not support them, they fear future difficulties in their work; if they do support, it amounts to tens of thousands of yuan a year, which is truly a waste of money.

It is indeed necessary for the state to plan and compile books that promote advanced and exemplary figures, which can inspire contemporary people's morale and leave a legacy for future generations to admire. However, the current situation, where the state, ministries, and provinces all compile such books, is becoming quite rampant. Some organizers even force notable figures to contribute book titles and forewords to expand their influence. We believe this is unnecessary. In essence, it is using propaganda as a cover to engage in extortion. In reality, some compilers have indeed made a small fortune.

The country is currently in a period of rectification and austerity, and all citizens need to tighten their belts for a few years. This phenomenon of indiscriminately publishing biographical dictionaries and biographies is detrimental to the overall situation and needs to be curbed.

### 名人辞典何其多

    名人辞典何其多
    近来编纂出版企业家、工程师、教师等名人辞典和人物报告文学集，成为一种时髦。我单位每个月都要收到一二封这样的来信或接待一二次来访。这些人都有一个附加条件：要求赞助。少则几十元，多则几千元。有些编委还很有来头，企业不支持吧，怕以后工作找麻烦；支持吧，一年要几万元，实在是一笔冤枉钱。
    国家有计划地编一些弘扬先进、模范人物的书籍，既可以激励当代人的斗志，也可以留给后人景仰，确是一项很必要的工程。但像现在这样国家编、部委编、省市也要编，大有泛滥之势，还有些组织者硬拖来一些名人题书名、写序言，以扩大影响。我们认为这大可不必。说穿了，还不是以宣传为名，行摊派之实吗。实际上一些编纂者确实也发了一笔小财。
    国家正值治理整顿之机，全国人民都要过几年紧日子。这种乱出名人辞典、传记的现象，与大局无补而有害，确有刹刹之必要。
