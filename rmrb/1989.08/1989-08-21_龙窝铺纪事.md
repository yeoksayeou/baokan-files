	Chronicles of Longwo Pu
	Cui Xue Ming  Lin Jing Fu

	Perhaps to enhance the village's prestige, several villages in Songshan Township, Qixia County, Shandong, have names that are grand and intimidating, such as: Hukou, Longcun, Hushan, Longwo Pu, and so on.

	A village name is a legend. For example, Longwo Pu actually has a "dragon's nest." It is located on a hillside to the east of the village, a deep, bottomless cave. The elders say that a giant snake, also known as a "small dragon," lives inside. Although the name is impressive, the village has always been extremely poor, and few outsiders visit. During the Cultural Revolution, the "struggle sessions" were quite lively.

	In July of this year, while reporting in Songshan Township, we happened to mention Longwo Pu. The township Party Committee Secretary Zhang Jinxue and the township head Tan Deshui both said that Longwo Pu has undergone tremendous changes in the past decade and insisted that we go and see for ourselves. Thus, we arrived at this village that we had not visited for over ten years.

	The village was almost unrecognizable. A new two-story building stood in the west. The old thatched houses were gone, replaced by new houses with cement roofs and whitewashed walls. The streets had become straight and wide. In the south of the village, two kilns stood on an open field—one for lime and one for cement. The roar of machinery echoed, as if saying: Longwo Pu has changed, changed...

	At the village committee, we met Lin Yuanbao, the village Party branch secretary. He is 48 years old and full of energy. Reflecting on the past decade of leading the villagers in their entrepreneurial journey, he sighed: "The reason Longwo Pu has changed so much is that our branch 'leadership team' has performed three key acts well." Lin Yuanbao's father was an old village secretary who was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution. As a result, Lin Yuanbao was also implicated and removed from his position as the village Youth League branch secretary. However, the villagers understood Lin Yuanbao. In 1979, he became the village Party branch secretary. At that time, some who had once bullied Lin Yuanbao were worried that he would seek revenge. However, to everyone's surprise, Lin Yuanbao announced at a meeting: "All past grievances are forgiven." The secretary led the way in eliminating factionalism and resolving conflicts, and the atmosphere of unity among Party members and villagers grew stronger day by day.

	The second act was to develop water conservancy and achieve high grain yields. In 1978, this "dragon's nest" was a dry hole. The entire village had only one shallow well, and there were very few irrigated fields. The grain yield per mu was not high. The villagers wanted to develop water resources but were afraid of wasting labor and money, fearing that both water and funds would be lost. Lin Yuanbao persuaded everyone to raise several million yuan to build a reservoir with abundant water. Later, they drilled four more wells and installed running water. The villagers no longer had to worry about irrigation and drinking water. Now, Longwo Pu has fully realized water conservancy. In 1988, the total grain production reached 440,000 kilograms, nearly 80% more than in 1978.

	The third act was to develop secondary and tertiary industries according to local conditions. They focused on the village's advantage of having abundant limestone and made the most of it. They successively built a medium-sized lime kiln factory, a small cement factory, and a stone factory. At the same time, using these three factories as a base, they mobilized households to provide "pre-production services" and "post-production processing" for the three factories. Now, Longwo Pu has become the most famous building materials specialty village in the county. In 1988, the per capita income was 850 yuan, ten times that of 1977. Longwo Pu truly became famous.

    龙窝铺纪事
    崔学明　林景福
    大概是为了壮大村威，山东栖霞县松山乡有几个村子的村名起得好大、好吓人，诸如：虎龙口、龙村、虎山、龙窝铺等等。
    一个村名，便是一个传说。比如龙窝铺，就真有“龙窝”。它位于村东的山坡上，是一个深不见底的弯石洞。老人们说这里面住着一条巨蛇，又称“小龙”。名虽不赖，可这村一直穷得叮当响，外人很少光顾。文革中“派仗”打得很热闹。
    今年7月里，到松山乡采访，偶然间谈到龙窝铺，乡党委书记张金学和乡长谭得水都说龙窝铺近十年发生了巨大变化，执意要我们去走走，看看。于是，我们来到了这个久违10多年的村庄。
    简直认不出这个村庄的模样了。村西耸立起一幢崭新的二层楼。昔日陈旧的草房不见影子了，水泥瓦盖顶、白石灰抹墙的新农房比比皆是。街道也变得笔直宽敞了。村南空地上，耸立起两座窑——一座是石灰窑，一座是水泥窑，机器的轰鸣声一阵阵传来，好像在说：龙窝铺变了，变了……
    在村委会，我们见到了村支部书记林美元。他今年48岁，精力充沛。回顾近十年带领群众走过的创业之路，他感慨地说：龙窝铺村能发生这么大的变化，关键在我们支部“一班人”唱好了三部曲。林美元的父亲是个老支书，文化大革命中被迫害而死。为此，林美元也受了牵连，被撤了村团支部书记的职务。但是，群众是了解林美元的。1979年，他担任了村党支部书记。当时，个别曾欺辱过林美元的人，很担心他会打击报复。然而，出乎意料，林美元在大会上宣布：“过去的一切恩恩怨怨都一笔钩销。”支书带头消派性，解疙瘩，党员、村民之间团结的气氛一天天浓起来。
    这第二部曲是兴修水利，夺取粮食高产。1978年时，这个“龙窝”是个旱窝窝，全村只有一眼浅机井，水浇地寥寥无几，粮食平均亩产不高。村里人既想搞水，又怕搞水，怕的是劳民伤财，水、财两空。林美元说服大家，集资数万元，建成一座水量丰富的平塘。以后他们又打了4眼机井，安上了自来水，全村人再也不用为浇地和吃水犯愁。现在，龙窝铺村已全部实现了水利化。1988年，粮食总产达44万公斤，比1978年增加了近80％。
    第三部曲是因地制宜发展工副业。他们瞄准了本村石灰石多的优势，大做石头文章。先后建起中型石灰窑厂、小型水泥厂和石子厂。同时，以这3个厂子为依托，发动农户为3个厂子搞“产前服务”和“产后加工”。如今龙窝铺成了全县最出名的建材专业村。1988年，全村人均收入850元，是1977年的10倍。龙窝铺真的名声大震了。
