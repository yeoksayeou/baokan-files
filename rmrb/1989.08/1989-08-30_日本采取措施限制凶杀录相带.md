Japan's Cabinet Management and Coordination Agency Director, Kiyoshi Mizuno, today proposed at a cabinet meeting that measures be taken to restrict video tapes containing violent murder content.

According to reports from local evening newspapers today, he urged the business community producing and selling such video tapes to voluntarily take restrictive measures. He also called on prefectures, districts, and counties to study and amend youth protection regulations, adding and strengthening the enforcement of provisions prohibiting the viewing of such video tapes. Additionally, he advocated for promoting the movement to purify the environment for youth protection organizations.

In Japan, video tapes, publications, films, and related facilities that promote obscenity and theft, as well as depict violent murders, are rampant. Although the government has various written restrictions, it is difficult to truly restrict and eliminate them due to the emphasis on respecting "human rights" and "art." The director's proposal today comes in the wake of a recent incident where a youth, imitating the content of a video tape, brutally murdered three innocent young girls, which shocked the nation.

After the arrest of the perpetrator in the aforementioned murder case, local governments in Tokyo, Mie Prefecture, and Yamanashi Prefecture have all expressed their intention to add provisions to their youth protection regulations prohibiting youth from viewing such harmful video tapes. Some Japanese television stations have also recently canceled scheduled broadcasts of programs containing violent content.

    日本采取措施限制凶杀录相带
    新华社东京8月29日电　日本内阁总务厅长官水野清今天在内阁会议上提出，要对录有残酷杀人内容的录相带采取限制措施。
    据此间晚报今天报道，他要求生产、推销这种录相带的企业界努力采取自觉限制措施；各都、道、府、县要研究修改青少年保护条例，增加和加强执行禁止观看这类录相带的有关规定；推进保护青少年团体净化环境的运动。
    在日本，诲淫诲盗、残酷杀人的录相带、刊物、电影及有关设施泛滥成灾，政府对此虽有种种明文限制规定，但由于标榜尊重“人权”和“艺术”，很难真正限制、取谛。总务厅长官今天的主张，是在最近一青年模仿录相内容，接连残酷杀害3名无辜幼女惨案轰动了全国后提出的。
    上述凶杀案破案后，东京都、三重县、山梨县等地方政府都表示要在保护青少年条例中增加禁止青少年看这类坏录相带的规定。日本一些电视台近期内纷纷取消原定播放的凶杀内容影片节目。
