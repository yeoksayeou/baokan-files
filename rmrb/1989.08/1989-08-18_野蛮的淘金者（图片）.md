Since the state implemented protective mining of gold deposits, hundreds of individual gold miners still gather around the gold dredging ships in the Sinan River sand gold mine in Muping County, Shandong Province every day. Order in the mining area is chaotic, with frequent fights, and some gold miners have even lost their lives in disputes over mining sand. Cases of theft and sabotage of mining equipment also occur from time to time. How to implement a protective mining plan is a major challenge facing the Sinan River sand gold mine. The image shows individual gold miners scrambling for mining sand.

    野蛮的淘金者
    国家对黄金矿产实行保护性开采以来，山东牟平县辛安河砂金矿采金船周围每天仍聚集着上百的个体淘金者。在争抢矿砂中，矿区秩序混乱，械斗不断，曾有淘金者因争抢矿砂丧命；盗窃和破坏采矿机具的案件也时有发生。怎样实行保护性计划开采，是辛安河砂金矿面临的一大难题。图为个体淘金者在争抢矿砂。
