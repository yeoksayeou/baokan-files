Notice to Readers

October 1st of this year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of our nation.

Over the past 40 years, our country has undergone tremendous historical changes. To comprehensively and fully reflect the outstanding achievements of various regions, starting today, our newspaper will publish special editions for each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government on the fourth page. These special editions, from topic selection, final drafts to page layout, have received high attention and active support from the leading organs and relevant departments of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, thus enabling them to be published in a relatively short time. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to them.

The publication dates of the special editions will be arranged in the order of submission.
