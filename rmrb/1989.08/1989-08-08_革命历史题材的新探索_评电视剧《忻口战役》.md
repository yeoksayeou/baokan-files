On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the television series "The Battle of Xinkou," which reflects the War of Resistance against Japan, has been well-received since its broadcast. This six-episode series, produced by Shanxi Xinzhou Television Station, focuses on the fierce battle between the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Communist Party of China in Xinkou, Shanxi Province, during the early stages of the War of Resistance against Japan. It vividly recreates the great battle that took place fifty years ago and successfully portrays numerous artistic figures, including leaders of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army such as Peng Dehuai, Zuo Quan, Nie Rongzhen, Liao Hansheng, and Chen Xilian, as well as Nationalist leaders like Wei Lihuang, Fu Zuoyi, Hao Mengling, Yan Xishan, Wang Jingguo, and Jiang Yuqing. This television series is a significant work in China's television industry that reflects the joint efforts of the two parties and two armies in resisting Japanese aggression. The creators of this series have infused it with deep reflections on history and reality, embodying their efforts to promote the spirit of our nation. "The Battle of Xinkou" uses a vast and magnificent historical canvas to emphasize the theme of the two parties cooperating again and the unification of the nation, which has significant thought-provoking value and contemporary relevance. It powerfully resonates with the most universal national sentiments and the desire for unification among the audience, making it an artistic work that revisits the history of cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists and calls for the return of Taiwan to the motherland.

"The Battle of Xinkou" has made many new pursuits in its artistic expression. Firstly, it demonstrates uniqueness and discovery in its choice of themes. It not only depicts the specific processes of battles with blazing fires and dense smoke but also focuses on the emotional world of individuals. It not only reveals the life-and-death struggles between justice and evil but also praises the heroic figures who stood tall during the critical moments of the nation's survival. Moreover, it reviews, grasps, and presents this historical period from a new historical and contemporary height, providing a three-dimensional and intersecting view of the comprehensive anti-war efforts of various individuals in the entire Chinese nation. It discovers unique and profound thought content from a faithful portrayal of historical facts, which is meaningful for the deepening of television drama creation on revolutionary historical themes.

"The Battle of Xinkou" also handles well the combination of describing the external actions of the war process and soldiers' battles with the focus on portraying characters' personalities and revealing their emotional turmoil. In character portrayal, "The Battle of Xinkou" is very successful. It starts from the living and breathing characters who are the main subjects of the war, rather than from concepts, consciously pursuing the artistic effect of capturing both form and spirit, creating a batch of true and believable, vivid and lifelike artistic images. Among these successful artistic images, the most impressive ones are Peng Dehuai, Wei Lihuang, Yan Xishan, and Jiang Yuqing. This is not only because the authors have devoted much ink to these characters but also because the directors have discovered personalities with considerable general significance in these characters. The ability to portray numerous historical figures and artistic images from multiple angles and levels in the play is a valuable exploration by the directors in their artistic handling, moving from the external appearance of characters to their psychology, and from the single-dimensional portrayal of characters to the multi-dimensional portrayal of their personalities.

    革命历史题材的新探索
    ——评电视剧《忻口战役》
    苏华
    在纪念我们新中国成立四十周年之际，反映抗日战争的电视剧《忻口战役》（编剧董耀章、郭秋池，导演白夫今，山西忻州电视台摄制），播出后受到好评。这部六集的电视剧以抗战初期国共两党、两军在山西忻口正面阻击日寇之血战为内容，真实地再现了五十年前的那场大会战，成功地塑造了我党、我军将领彭德怀、左权、聂荣臻、廖汉生、陈锡联，国民党将领卫立煌、傅作义、郝梦龄、阎锡山、王靖国、姜玉贞等众多的艺术形象，是我国视坛一部反映国共两党两军共同抗击日本侵略者的电视剧。这部电视剧熔铸了创作者对历史和现实的深层思考，体现了创作者对我们民族精神的弘扬。《忻口战役》通过驳杂恢宏的历史画卷所着力阐发的国共两党再次合作，“双流合抱”民族和平统一的题旨，是具有思考价值和现实意义的。它强有力地拨动着观众最普遍的民族感情和统一愿望，是重温国共合作历史，呼唤台湾回归祖国的艺术作品。
    《忻口战役》在艺术表现方面有许多新的追求。首先，我们看到它在题材选择上所显示的独特性和发现性。它不但描写了火光冲天、硝烟弥漫的作战的具体过程，同时又把视焦对准了人的感情世界；不但揭示了正义与邪恶的生死搏杀，赞美了在民族生死存亡时可歌可泣的一代脊梁，而且站在了新的历史高度和时代高度来回顾、把握和表现这段历史，立体交叉地展现了整个中华民族各方人士全面抗战的真实一隅。它从忠实于历史史实之中发现独特的、深邃的思想容量，对革命历史题材的电视剧创作的深化是有意义的。
    《忻口战役》在描写战争进程和将士战斗的外部行动与着力刻画人物性格和揭示人物内心世界的感情波澜的结合上，也有着较好的处理。
    《忻口战役》在人物性格刻画上是很成功的。它从活生生的作为战争主体因素的人物出发，而不是从概念出发，有意识地追求形神兼似的艺术效果，塑造了一批真实可信、有血有肉的艺术形象。在这一批成功的艺术形象中，给人印象最深的尤以彭德怀、卫立煌、阎锡山、姜玉贞等为重。这固然与作者在这些人物身上着墨颇多有关，但最主要的恐怕还在于编导在这些人物身上发掘出了具有相当概括意义的人物性格。众多的历史人物和艺术形象在剧中能多侧面、多层次的塑造，确属编导在艺术处理上由人物外表走向人物心理，由人物性格的单一走向性格多重的可贵探索。
