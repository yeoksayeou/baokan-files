Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Ní Xiǎolín and Zhào Xīnglín report from Beijing:

The largest state-owned retail business in the country—Beijing Department Store—has recently merged with Beijing Printing Factory No. 4 across industries.

Beijing Printing Factory No. 4 is a collective enterprise covering an area of 1,300 square meters. In recent years, the printing industry has faced fierce competition, making it difficult for Printing Factory No. 4 to develop and forcing it to seek a new path. Meanwhile, Beijing Department Store has seen continuous improvements in economic performance, with daily customer visits reaching 130,000 and a crowded 18,000 square meters of business space.

After the merger, Beijing Department Store plans to relocate its garment manufacturing factory, currently situated within the department store, to the premises of Printing Factory No. 4.

    北京百货大楼兼并一工厂
    本报北京8月20日讯　新华社记者倪小林、本报记者赵兴林报道：全国最大的国营零售商业企业——北京市百货大楼，最近跨行业兼并了北京印刷四厂。
    北京市印刷四厂是一家集体企业，占地1300平方米。近几年印刷行业竞争激烈，印刷四厂的发展十分艰难，面临重新选择出路的问题。而北京市百货大楼近几年经济效益不断提高，每日接待13万人次顾客、现有1.8万平方米营业面积拥挤不堪。
    兼并后，北京市百货大楼准备将设在大楼里的服装加工厂迁入印刷四厂厂址。
