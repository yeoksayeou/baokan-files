People's Daily, Washington, August 10th.

A report released today states that tuition fees at many American universities have risen by 9% this autumn, marking the sixth consecutive year that tuition has increased at a rate higher than inflation. This brings the average cost of a bachelor's degree to $85,000.

The increase in tuition fees at public universities is slightly lower than that at private universities. Tuition fees at two-year and four-year public universities have increased by 6% and 8% respectively, while private universities have seen a 9% increase. The inflation rate for the 12 months leading up to the end of June this year was 5.2%.

The report indicates that the annual tuition fees at some top-tier universities have reached a staggering $22,000. The most expensive university remains Bennington College in Vermont, with a total cost of $21,775 for tuition, room and board, and other miscellaneous fees. Harvard University and others follow closely, with various fees totaling around $20,000 to $21,000.

In the Washington area, the private Georgetown University's tuition fees also exceed $20,000.
