Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th.

According to information received here, after Iran vowed to retaliate against Israel for the abduction of Hezbollah leader Sheikh Abed al-Aziz Obeid, Israeli forces were placed on alert today.

Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi earlier stated that Israel's abduction of Obeid would provoke Muslim retaliation.

Meanwhile, a group calling itself "The Oppressed of the World" threatened to hang American hostage Frank Reed if Obeid was not released.

Obeid was abducted from his home in southern Lebanon on July 28. Israel suspects him of involvement in the abduction of Reed last year and supporting anti-Israeli activities.

    伊朗说将报复以色列  以军已处于戒备状态
    新华社开罗7月30日电　据此间收到的消息说，在伊朗表示要对以色列绑架黎巴嫩真主党领导人奥贝德事件进行报复后，以色列部队今天处于戒备状态。
    伊朗总理穆萨维早些时候说，以色列绑架奥贝德将会引发穆斯林的报复。
    与此同时，一个自称为“世界被压迫者”的组织威胁说，如果不释放奥贝德，美国人质希金斯将被绞死。
    奥贝德是7月28日在黎巴嫩南部他的家中被绑架的。以色列怀疑他参与了去年绑架希金斯事件和支持反对以色列活动。
