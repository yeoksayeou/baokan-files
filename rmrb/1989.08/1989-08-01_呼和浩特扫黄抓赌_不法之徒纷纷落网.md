Hohhot Cracks Down on Pornography and Gambling: Lawbreakers Fall into the Net

Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency Hohhot, August 1 (Reporter Shi Guiping) In recent days, the Hohhot municipal government has organized the public security, culture, industry and commerce, and urban management departments to thoroughly clean up and rectify the cultural market. A batch of pornographic books, videotapes, gambling tools, and prohibited items have been confiscated, and some criminals have fallen into the net. The general public has applauded this.

Due to the recent spread of bourgeois liberalization, some lawbreakers have taken the opportunity to become active. Pornographic books and obscene items have successively flowed into this border city, and phenomena such as gambling have been rampant and difficult to eradicate.

After Xinhua News Agency reported on July 23 that the New China Square in Hohhot had become a gambling den, the Hohhot Public Security Bureau, on the 24th, immediately followed the instructions of the municipal government. Along with the heads of various relevant departments, they led more than 400 people to clean up and rectify the New China Square. At the same time, they conducted a thorough investigation of the streets and alleys.

Currently, the Public Security Bureau has cracked down on 352 cases of gambling and dealt with 24 people. At the same time, they have solved 17 cases of spreading obscene materials, seized 99 pornographic videotapes, more than 300 obscene books, and sealed off more than 20,000 books awaiting examination.

    新华社呼和浩特8月1日电　（记者石圭平）呼和浩特市政府连日来组织公安、文化、工商、市容等部门，认真清理整顿文化市场，收缴一批黄色书刊、录像带、赌具、违禁物品，一些犯罪分子落入法网。广大市民为此拍手称快。

    7月23日本社播发呼市新华广场变成赌博场的报道后，呼市公安局24日即根据市政府的指示，会同各有关部门负责人带领400多人对新华广场进行了清理整顿，同时也对大街小巷进行了认真的清查。
