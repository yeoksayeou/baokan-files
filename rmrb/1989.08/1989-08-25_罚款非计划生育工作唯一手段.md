The People's Daily, August 5th, published an article titled "Exiting the Birth Trap," which highlighted the "five light and five heavy" birth traps: "preferring sons over daughters," "preferring the young over the old," "quantity over quality," "family over country," and "name over reality." These points are very pertinent. Currently, in some regions, to effectively control population growth, economic sanctions are imposed on those who exceed the birth plan, achieving some results. However, the author believes that this family planning work has become distorted, falling into a new dilemma.

Firstly, the imbalance in economic development has led to actual inequality in family planning. Some people, having become wealthy first, disregard national interests, blindly reproduce, and pass on the family line. Fines mean nothing to them. The author has a relative whose third child was an over-quota birth. No amount of persuasion worked. He told his wife, "Just go ahead and have the baby, I have the money." His wife indeed gave birth to twins, and the fine was 1,600 yuan, which he paid immediately. In the same county, a couple in Zhouwan Town who had an over-quota birth could not afford the fine and had to mortgage their house. Those who cannot pay the fine have no choice but to undergo sterilization. Some people joke that now, if you have money, you can have as many children as you want, with nothing to fear.

Secondly, economic sanctions, originally a means to control births, have in some regions become the goal itself, used to increase a unit's economic income. Some units focus on family planning work solely for collecting fines, resulting in substantial income but failing to control the population.

Thirdly, relying solely on economic sanctions strains interpersonal relationships, making family planning work even more difficult. People generally have grievances against party members and cadres because, when family planning work is enforced, party members and cadres lead by example by paying fines, allowing them to have over-quota births openly. The masses, while complying outwardly, are not convinced inwardly. This model of leading by example seems rather unglamorous. Moreover, during the process of fining and collecting fines, various interpersonal frictions are inevitable.

The author does not entirely deny the auxiliary role of fines in family planning work. However, facing this "most difficult" social project, relying solely on economic sanctions is unlikely to achieve significant results. This comprehensive project requires not only strengthening ideological and political work, propagating to the people the superiority of family planning in "benefiting future generations," but also comprehensive management in areas such as child healthcare, women's healthcare, and caring for the elderly.

### 罚款非计划生育工作唯一手段

    罚款非计划生育工作唯一手段
    贵报八月五日刊登了《走出生育误区》的文章，提出了“重男轻女”、“重幼轻长”、“重量轻质”、“重家轻国”、“重名轻实”的“五轻五重”的生育误区，切中时弊。目前，在某些地区为了有效地控制人口增长，对超计划生育实行经济制裁，收到了一定的效果。但笔者觉得这种计生工作发生了畸变，走进了新的困境。
    其一，经济发展的不平衡，导致了计划生育问题上的实际上的不平等。有的人先富了起来，就置国家利益而不顾，盲目生育，传宗接代，罚款根本不在他们话下。笔者有位亲属，第三胎属超生，对他做任何工作都没用。他对老婆说：“只管生，我有钱”。他老婆也真争气，生了双胞胎，罚款一千六百元，他当即如数付款。本县都镇湾镇的一对夫妇超生交不起罚款，只能拆房子作抵押。这些人交不出罚款，就只好节育了。有人挖苦说，现在是有钱就能生孩子，有恃无恐。
    其二，经济制裁本来仅仅是控制生育的手段，如今在某些地区手段演变成了目的，用于为单位增加经济收入。有些单位抓计划生育工作就是收罚款，到头来，进项颇为可观，人口控制却落了空。
    其三，单纯搞经济制裁导致人际关系紧张，计划生育工作更难开展。人们普遍对党员干部有意见，因为一抓计划生育工作，党员干部们带头交罚款，以便堂而皇之地超计划生育，群众对此口服心不服，这种模范带头作用似乎不那么光彩。此外，罚款缴款过程中难免发生各种各样的人际摩擦。
    笔者本非全盘否定罚款对计划生育工作的辅助作用。但是，面对这样一项“天下第一难”的社会工程，孤立地实行经济制裁恐怕很难收到实效。这项综合工程，不仅要加强思想政治工作，向人民群众宣传计划生育“造福子孙”的优越性，而且要在儿童保健、妇女保健、抚恤老人等方面进行综合治理。
