Far-Off View

Poetry by Yan Yan

	It seems as if you have come from the sun,
	All men bow their sturdy backs,
	Living in distant places with joy,
	And each sunrise brings a new
	Consciousness, a totem.
	Every piece of land is ready
	To receive the seeds,
	Every pair of giant hands is ready
	To connect with the clouds,
	We have made countless preparations,
	Standing tall,
	Our blood surges.

    远眺
    蒋建军摄影
    严妍配诗
    仿佛你是从太阳中
    走来  所有的男人都
    弓起厚厚的脊梁  生活
    在遥远的地方欢悦
    而每一次日出  便是一种
    新意识的图腾
    每一片土地都准备
    接受种子
    每一双巨手都准备
    接通和白云的邮路
    我们做好了无数个准备
    挺直胸脯
    热血在汹涌
