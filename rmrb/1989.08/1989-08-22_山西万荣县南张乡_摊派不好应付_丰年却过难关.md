This year's summer grain harvest was again bountiful, but farmers are worried about the various assigned quotas that are hard to handle. For this reason, I wrote a letter to the People's Daily. Soon, an editor from the People's Daily Mass Work Department called me, asking me to investigate the detailed situation. Thus, I conducted a detailed investigation and gathered evidence in some villages. The quotas for various townships (towns) and villages differ, ranging from six to seven yuan to twenty yuan.

Yao Family Village: Each Person Assigned 17 Yuan
In Yao Family Village, Nanzhang Township, Wanrong County, each person is assigned 17 yuan. Taking the Lou Wenlu family as an example, the family has three members and cultivates 8.1 mu of land. This year, on July 3, they delivered 202 kilograms of wheat according to the quota, amounting to 150 yuan. After deducting agricultural taxes and other fees, the family should receive over 80 yuan. However, the village committee deducted various fees totaling 51 yuan in the form of receipts, including 17 yuan per person (7 yuan per person for township government fees and 10 yuan per person deducted by the village committee). The Lou Wenlu family actually received 27 yuan from selling grain. The village's method is to have the village collect and deliver the grain collectively, and the farmers settle accounts with the village committee.

Yan Village: Each Person Assigned 20 Yuan
In Yan Village, Nanzhang Township, Wanrong County, each person is assigned 20 yuan. For example, Xue Shurong's family of two people cultivates 3.9 mu of land. This year, in June, they delivered 87 kilograms of first-grade wheat, which should have earned them over 65 yuan. After deducting agricultural taxes and other fees, they should have received over 39 yuan from selling the grain. However, the township government assigned each person 8 yuan in various fees, and the village committee assigned each person 12 yuan, totaling 40 yuan for the family. The village committee deducted the earned grain money of over 39 yuan, which was still not enough, so they had to pay an additional 3 jiao. Before this, the village committee did not explain to the villagers why the township government was deducting 8 yuan per person, nor did they explain what the 12 yuan per person deducted by the village committee was for. It is understood that the villagers have strong objections to the mandatory assignments and have been strongly complaining, but no one has reported this to higher authorities; they only discuss it privately.

I believe that reasonable assignments should be transparent. Some townships and villages have numerous assignment items, and farmers do not know what is reasonable and what is not. I suggest that all levels of government publicize reasonable assignments to the public to facilitate social supervision. Only in this way can farmers understand and accept reasonable assignments and voluntarily pay them. For those who arbitrarily assign quotas to farmers, once reported, they must be seriously dealt with to establish the authority of the Party and the government in people's minds and to prevent affecting farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain.

### 山西万荣县南张乡——摊派不好应付　丰年却过难关

    山西万荣县南张乡——
    摊派不好应付　丰年却过难关
    今年夏粮又是一个丰收年，但农民愁的是各样的摊派难以应付。为此，我给人民日报写了一封信，很快，人民日报群众工作部编辑来电话，要我把详细情况调查一下，于是我又到部分村庄作了详细调查和取证。各乡（镇）提留卖粮款不同，各村摊派各异，少则六七元，多则20元。
    姚家村每人摊派17元
    万荣县南张乡姚家村每人被摊派17元。以娄文录家为例，他家共有3口人，耕种8.1亩土地，今年7月3日按任务交售小麦202公斤，金额150元，扣除农业税等款后，他家应得80余元，而村委会又以收据形式扣去各项费用款51元，其中包括每人17元（乡政府提留各项费用每人7元，村委会每人扣10元），娄文录家实得卖粮款27元。这个村采取的办法是村里统一收交公粮，农民同村委会结算。
    阎村每人摊派达20元
    万荣县南张乡阎村向每人摊派20元。如，薛树荣家两口人耕种3.9亩土地，今年6月交售一等小麦87公斤，应得款65元多，扣除农业税等款外，应得售粮款39元多。但乡政府让其每人摊各项费用8元，村委会要每人摊12元，他家共需摊款40元，村委会扣除所得卖粮款39元多还不够，又让其本人交了3角钱。在此之前，村委会既未向村民说明乡政府为什么要扣每人8元钱，也没有讲明村委会每人所摊的12元钱干什么。据了解，村民对硬性摊派意见很大，反映强烈，村民们的意见大又无人向上级反映，只是在私下议论。
    我认为，合理的摊派应有透明度。一些乡、村的摊派名目繁多，农民们也搞不清什么是合理的，什么是不合理的，建议各级政府对一些合理的摊派，广布于众，以便社会监督。只有这样，合理的摊派，农民是能够理解和接受的，也会自动自愿地交的。对一些随意让农民摊派的各级负责人，一经举报，必须严肃处理，确立党和政府在人们心目中的威信，以免影响农民售粮的积极性。
