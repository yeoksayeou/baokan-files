On July 31, news that U.S. Marine Corps Colonel William Higgins was killed in Lebanon reached Washington, immediately sparking intense reactions across the United States.

President Bush, who was in Chicago attending the National Governors Conference, condemned this as "unpopular terrorism" and described it as a shocking event for the American people. He cut short his planned trip to the Midwest, returning to Washington to convene a National Security Council meeting to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that Defense Secretary Cheney brought a list of possible actions to the White House, but no action plan was announced after the meeting. White House spokesman Fitzwater stated in a written statement that President Bush had listened to the briefings from his advisors and called on all parties in the Middle East to immediately release all hostages. Local media believe that in the face of Higgins' death, the government is in a difficult position with limited options.

Higgins was originally the head of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and was kidnapped as a hostage on February 17, 1988. However, the situation changed dramatically on July 28 when Israeli commandos kidnapped a leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah, Obeid. A Shiite Muslim organization then declared that if Israel refused to release Obeid, Higgins would meet an unfortunate fate.

Regarding Higgins' death, opinions are divided within the United States. Senate Minority Leader Dole severely criticized Israel's actions for endangering American lives, but the government has not yet confirmed when, where, or how Higgins died, or whether Israel's actions led to his death. Internationally, there is widespread condemnation of Higgins' murder, and the Senate passed a resolution that night calling for retaliation. However, the hostage issue is a sensitive matter, and several U.S. presidents have struggled with it, fearing to take rash actions. Defense Secretary Cheney advised President Bush to be cautious and not overreact. The main members of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Dickinson, told the media that Bush faces a difficult choice; using the military is not an option, as it would cost more lives. Senate Democratic Leader Mitchell said this is a very difficult, dangerous, and tense situation. An American life has been taken, and the lives of eight other American hostages are in jeopardy. To ensure their safety, it is important for the president to have as many options as possible. The families of the eight American hostages have expressed their views, calling Higgins' death a tragedy but urging the president to exercise restraint. They hope for diplomatic action rather than military action. For this reason, after today's emergency meeting at the White House, Bush did not immediately issue any retaliatory orders nor did he dispatch warships to the troubled region.

    布什政府的困难处境
    本报记者  张启昕
    7月31日，当美国海军陆战队威廉·希金斯中校在黎巴嫩被杀害的消息传到华盛顿，立即引起美国各界的剧烈反响。
    正在芝加哥出席全国州长会议的布什总统指责这是“不得人心的恐怖主义”，是件使美国人民极为震惊的事件。他中断了计划中的中西部之行，当即返回华盛顿召集国家安全委员会会议，研究对策。据称，国防部长切尼奉命给白宫带去了可供采取行动的清单，然而会后白宫并未宣布任何行动计划，白宫发言人菲茨沃特在书面声明中称，布什总统听取了顾问们的情况介绍，呼吁中东各方立即释放所有人质。此间报界认为，面对希金斯之死，政府处境左右为难，选择余地甚小。
    希金斯原是联合国维持黎巴嫩和平部队的负责人，于1988年2月17日被绑架作为人质。但直到今年7月28日以色列突击队绑架1名黎巴嫩真主党领导人奥贝德之后，事态突变。一个什叶派穆斯林组织宣称，如果以色列拒不释放奥贝德，希金斯将遭不幸。
    对于希金斯之死，目前美国国内众说纷纭。参院少数党领袖多尔严厉指责以色列的行为危及美国人的生命，但政府尚未肯定希金斯是何时何地如何死的，以及以色列的行动是否促成希金斯的被害。国际上对希金斯被害一片谴责声，参院当晚通过决议要求采取报复。然而，人质问题是个敏感问题，几届美国总统都为之绞尽脑汁，不敢贸然行动。国防部长切尼建议布什总统谨慎行事，不要作出过分反应。众院军委会主要成员、共和党人迪金森则对报界说，布什面临困难的抉择，使用军队罢，这不行，这将付出更多生命。参院民主党领袖米切尔则说，这是非常困难、危险而紧张的局势。一个美国人的生命被夺去，另外8个美国人质的生命危在旦夕，为了他们，重要的是总统应有尽可能广泛的选择方案。8位美国人质的家属纷纷发表意见，认为希金斯之死是个悲剧，但呼吁总统表示克制，他们希望采取外交行动，而不愿看到军事行动。正因为这样，在今天的白宫紧急会议之后，布什没有立即发布任何报复性命令，也没有向生事地区派遣军舰。
