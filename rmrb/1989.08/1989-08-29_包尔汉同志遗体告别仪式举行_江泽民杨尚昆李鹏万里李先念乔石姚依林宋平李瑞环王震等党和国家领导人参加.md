Comrade Bao Erhan's life was a life of revolution, a life dedicated to maintaining national unity and ethnic solidarity, and a life dedicated to the development, prosperity, and progress of all ethnic groups. Before liberation, he firmly supported and participated in the struggle of the Xinjiang people against imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and at the same time, he clearly opposed all activities that attempted to split the country. After the founding of New China, he served as the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government and a member of the Northwest Nationalities Affairs Commission. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he worked tirelessly to build and develop Xinjiang, promote the economic and cultural development of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and made significant contributions. Even in his later years, he was very concerned about the construction of Xinjiang and ethnic unity.

Comrade Bao Erhan was frugal, honest, strict with himself, and lenient with others. He always loved his country and his people, and was always loyal to the cause of the Party and the people. He adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles and firmly supported the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Comrade Bao Erhan dedicated his life to maintaining national unity and ethnic solidarity and to the cause of the Party.

Today, those who came to pay their respects to Comrade Bao Erhan's body included relevant comrades from the Organization Department, the United Front Work Department, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau, the Islamic Association of China, and other units, as well as more than 500 friends and relatives of Comrade Bao Erhan.
