Zhū Jí has been battling cancer for 8 years, with death slowly approaching. However, over these 8 years, he has, with astonishing willpower, conducted 372 autopsies despite his illness and written over 50 academic papers. He is Zhū Jí, a forensic medical examiner and Communist Party member from the Public Security Bureau of Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province.

At 56 years old, Zhū Jí has been working in forensic medicine for over 30 years. In October 1981, he suddenly fell ill at a crime scene. After a hospital examination, he was diagnosed with late-stage nasopharyngeal cancer. The cancer robbed him of his ability to speak and made eating difficult. Last October, the Taizhou Public Security Bureau invited him to consult on a female corpse transported from Zhejiang. Despite bleeding from his nasal cavity, he braved the rain to rush to the Taizhou crematorium, working continuously for 4 hours to obtain reliable evidence, thereby correcting the original erroneous conclusion. Some were moved by his spirit, while others thought he was too meticulous. Zhū Jí said, "Autopsies are a matter of life and death. The slightest oversight could result in wrongful convictions, causing irreparable harm to the state and the people."

His condition worsened day by day. The bureau leaders repeatedly advised him to rest and take care of his health. Zhū Jí simply smiled in response. In February of this year, while lying in bed, he learned that a male corpse found by the Baodian Highway was difficult to examine. Without hesitation, he got out of bed and rushed to the scene.

Cancer has gripped Zhū Jí, but it cannot destroy his will and determination. He maintains a tight grip on his work. He often reminds himself, "I cannot wait for death. Even if I live for one more day, I will struggle for 24 hours." Besides going to work every day, he also uses the evenings to write academic papers, compiling his years of forensic medical work into written form. In recent years, over 10 provincial-level and above magazines, including *Jiangsu Traditional Chinese Medicine*, *Criminal Technology*, *Forensic Communications*, *Criminal Investigation Research*, and *Forensic Materials Compilation*, have published his articles. His paper "*Toad Poisoning*" was selected for inclusion in Professor Guo Jingwen's edited book *Practical Forensic Medicine*.

In 1988, Zhū Jí was named an outstanding party member and advanced worker in Taizhou City and a labor model in Yangzhou City. On August 5 of this year, the Taizhou Municipal Party Committee and Government called on all citizens of Taizhou to learn from Zhū Jí's advanced deeds.

    朱汲没被病魔压倒
    他身患癌症8年了，死神正一步一步地向他逼近。然而8年中，他以惊人的毅力抱病验尸（体）372件，撰写论文50余篇。他就是江苏省泰州市公安局法医师、共产党员朱汲。
    今年56岁的朱汲，从事法医工作30多年。1981年10月，他突然病倒在破案现场。经医院检查，确诊为鼻咽癌晚期。癌症使他失去了语言表达功能，饮食困难。去年10月，泰县公安局请他会诊一具从浙江运回的女尸，他不顾鼻腔出血，冒雨赶往泰县火化场，连续工作了4小时，终于取得了可靠的论证，从而纠正了原来的错误结论。有人为他的精神所感动，也有人认为他太认真了。朱汲却说：“验尸是人命关天的大事。稍一疏忽，就可能造成冤假错案，给国家和人民带来不可弥补的损失。”
    他的病情一天天恶化。局领导多次劝他休息，注意保养身体。领导的关心，朱汲只报之一笑。今年2月，他正躺在病床上，当得知该市鲍坝公路边的一具男尸检验困难时，他二话没说，翻身下床，及时赶赴现场。
    癌症攫住了朱汲，但并不能摧毁他的意志和毅力。他坚持工作的弦始终绷得紧紧的。他常提醒自己，“我不能等死，即使活一天也要拚搏24小时。”他除了每天按时上班，还利用晚间撰写论文，他要把他多年来从事法医工作的实践整理成文。近年来，《江苏中医》、《刑事技术》、《法医通讯》、《刑侦研究》、《法医资料汇编》等10多种省级以上的杂志都登载过他的文章。他的《蟾蜍中毒》一文被选入郭景文教授主编的《实用法医学》一书。
    1988年，朱汲被评为泰州市优秀党员、先进工作者，扬州市劳模。今年8月5日，中共泰州市委、市政府号召全市人民学习朱汲的先进事迹。
