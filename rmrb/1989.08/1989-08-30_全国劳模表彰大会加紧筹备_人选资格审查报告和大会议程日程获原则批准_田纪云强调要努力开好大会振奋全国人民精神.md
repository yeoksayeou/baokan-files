The preparations for the National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Awards Conference are in full swing. The report on the qualification review of the nominees and the agenda and schedule of the conference have been preliminarily approved.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun presided over the second full meeting of the preparatory committee for the National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Awards Conference this morning. He listened to the report on the conference preparations from the preparatory committee office and preliminarily approved the report on the qualification review of the national labor models and advanced workers and the agenda and schedule of the awards conference.

The nearly 2,800 national labor models and advanced workers who will attend the conference, scheduled for late September, come from 51 systems or industries, including industry, agriculture, transportation, finance and trade, construction, scientific research, and education. Among them, workers make up 30.5%, farmers 17.5%, scientific researchers and engineering technicians 11%, and workers in culture, education, health, and sports 11.2%. This labor model selection has identified outstanding role models from various fronts since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. Throughout the review process, the spirit of the instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council has been upheld, and the selection criteria have been strictly followed. The principles of democratic recommendation, emphasis on achievements, and selecting the best from the best have been adhered to, ensuring the advanced nature and representativeness of the labor models.

Tian Jiyun emphasized at the meeting the importance of holding the National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Awards Conference at this time. He said that holding this labor model conference after the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion have been suppressed will play an important role in inspiring the Chinese people to boost their spirits and better implement the policies of rectification and reform and opening up, and achieve the goals set by the Fourth Plenary Session. He hoped that all sectors would work together to make this awards conference a success.

Tian Jiyun proposed to continue doing a good job in the organizational work of the conference and to make this awards conference a high-quality one. For those selected as national labor models and advanced workers, the selection criteria must be strictly followed, the democratic recommendation procedures must be strictly followed, and a strict review must be conducted. Those who do not meet the criteria must not be selected. A strict review must be conducted to ensure that the national labor models and advanced workers truly have advanced nature and representativeness, and to guarantee the quality and effectiveness of the conference. He also demanded strengthening the publicity work for the awards conference, widely publicizing the advanced deeds of the model figures, fully playing the exemplary role, and inspiring people to strive forward.

It is reported that among this batch of national labor models and advanced workers, some have been working for many years in harsh industries or on the production front lines, working hard and enduring hardships without complaint. They not only have communist thoughts and a strong sense of ownership but also have excellent professional skills and good professional ethics. Some have made significant contributions to the development of agriculture and the rural economy. Some have made outstanding contributions to the development of China's science and technology and education. Some are committed to reform and innovation, making significant contributions to the development of production, improvement of management, and enhancement of economic and social benefits. Some have stood firm and clear in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, making significant contributions to the protection of national and people's interests.
