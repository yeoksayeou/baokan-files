The Sichuan Provincial Committee and Provincial Government decided today to remove Zheng Hengkang (a deputy ministerial-level cadre) from his positions as Vice Chairman and General Manager of the Sichuan New Light Industrial and Import-Export Company. Further investigation into his misuse of power and serious illegal business operations will continue, and appropriate action will be taken after the facts are clear.

The Sichuan New Light Company was established in May 1979, with Zheng Hengkang, the former Deputy Director of the Provincial National Defense Office, serving as Vice Chairman and General Manager. Due to Zheng Hengkang's severe bureaucratism and irresponsibility, the company caused enormous economic losses to the state. In September 1985, Zheng Hengkang, without consulting on the creditworthiness of the heavily indebted Hong Kong businessman Hong Chaohui, signed a joint venture agreement with Hong to establish the Shu Hui Company without proper approval. Our representatives in Hong Kong learned of the news from the newspapers and managed to find Zheng Hengkang, criticizing him for his actions. Zheng Hengkang ignored the criticism, falsely reported the situation, and officially established the Shu Hui Company in Hong Kong in April 1986. At the time of the company's establishment, Zheng Hengkang remitted 8 million Hong Kong dollars as per the contract, which was immediately misappropriated by Hong. In March 1988, Hong was sentenced to four years in prison by the Hong Kong court for defrauding a large sum of money, resulting in a loss of 3.33 million Hong Kong dollars that could not be recovered.

In March 1987, Zheng Hengkang, without proper authorization, signed off on a false report of 500 million yuan in funds (with no actual funds) and 400 employees (with only a few actual employees), and approved the establishment of the "New Light Tourism Service Company," a state-owned enterprise, with himself as the Chairman. After the tourism company was established, Zheng Hengkang handed it over to individuals like Wu Jinshun (who fled in early 1988 and was later apprehended), a group of parolees and individuals who had been detained by the public security authorities. Due to the company's chaotic management and illegal operations, its business license was revoked at the beginning of this year. Currently, the company owes 2.97 million yuan, and 18 creditors have sued the tourism company and the New Light Company, demanding repayment.

In March 1986, Zheng Hengkang signed a series of contracts with Hong Chaohui and a certain foreign businessman, Paul, to process and export axles and tapered sleeves worth 900 million US dollars, resulting in severe product backlog and occupying funds with interest and warehouse rent totaling over 6 million yuan.

In addition, the Sichuan Daily published a commentary on August 3 titled "Severe Negligence Must Be Punished." The article pointed out that while our Party is punishing corruption, bribery, and the misuse of power for personal gain, it also includes negligence and dereliction of duty caused by bureaucratism. The errors made by Zheng Hengkang are serious bureaucratic mistakes that have caused enormous economic losses to the state. The "tuition" paid by this wasteful behavior is something the state and the people cannot afford. Tolerating such behavior is a crime against the people.

    严重失职给国家造成巨额经济损失
   “新光”总经理郑亨康被撤职
    本报成都8月2日电　记者罗茂城、陈华报道：四川省委、省政府今天决定，撤销郑亨康（正厅级干部）四川省新光工业进出口公司副董事长、总经理职务，并对他以权谋私、严重违法经营等问题继续进行审查，待问题查清后再作处理。
    四川新光公司于1979年5月成立，原省国防工办副主任郑亨康担任副董事长、总经理。由于郑亨康官僚主义严重，不负责任，给国家造成了巨大经济损失。1985年9月，郑亨康没有对严重负债的港商洪朝辉的资信情况进行咨询，未报批即私自去香港，与洪草签合办蜀辉公司。我驻港澳机构从报纸上得知消息后，设法找到郑亨康，对其进行了批评。郑亨康置若罔闻，谎报情况，于1986年4月在港正式成立了蜀辉公司。公司成立时，郑亨康按合同汇去800万港元，即被洪挪用。1988年3月洪因串骗巨款被香港法院判刑4年，造成欠我方333万港元无法收回。
    1987年3月，经郑亨康签发虚报资金500万元（实际无资金）、从业人员400人（实际只有几个人），越权批准向成都市工商局申请成立全民所有制性质的“新光旅游服务公司”，郑亨康任董事长。旅游公司成立后，郑亨康即交给个体户吴谨春（1988年初潜逃，后抓回）等一批劳改释放和被公安机关收审过的人去经营。1987年3月，郑亨康又推荐尚未办理转业手续的儿子郑涛到旅游公司工作，4月被任命为副总经理。由于该公司管理混乱，违法经营，今年初被吊销营业执照。目前该公司负债达297万元，还有18家债主向法院控告旅游公司和新光公司，要求还债。
    1986年3月，郑亨康与洪朝辉及某外国皮包商保尔签定了加工出口价值900万美元的轴套、锥套的连环合同，造成产品严重积压，占用资金的利息和租库费高达60多万元。
    又讯　四川日报8月3日就查处郑亨康一案发表评论员文章《必须惩治严重失职行为》。文章指出，我们党在惩治贪污受贿以权谋私等腐败现象时对官僚主义造成的失职渎职行为，同样列入惩治之列。郑亨康所犯的错误，就属于严重官僚主义的失职错误，给国家造成了巨大经济损失。这种败家子作风所交的“学费”，国家交不起，人民交不起。姑息这种行为，就是对人民的犯罪。
