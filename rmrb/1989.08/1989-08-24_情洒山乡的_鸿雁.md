In the depths of the Yanshan Mountains in Beijing, along the narrow passes of the Jingyuan railway line, there are scattered sentries dressed in olive-green uniforms. Among them, the one known as the "wild geese of the countryside," Xuan Xiuhua, is an ordinary soldier in the armed police communications unit.

Xuan Xiuhua, who is in his early twenties, not only has to traverse mountains and tunnels every day to deliver newspapers, letters, and purchase daily necessities for his comrades, but also insists on walking over 20 miles of mountain roads to deliver newspapers and letters to 13 units and the public in the garrison area, including train stations, schools, and nursing homes.

Every time Xuan Xiuhua enters the post office with his mailbag, seeing the piles of letters that take ten days or half a month to reach the hands of the people, he thinks, as a soldier in the communications unit, if he could help the people solve the problem of communication difficulties in his spare time, that would be great! His idea quickly gained the support of the unit leaders. From then on, Xuan Xiuhua became the "volunteer mailman" for the countryside.

Although delivering newspapers and letters is not a difficult task, it is not so easy in the mountains. At the beginning, Xuan was unfamiliar with the people living in the scattered mountain areas. To avoid detours and ensure that the letters reach the people accurately, he often carried a small notebook, recording the addresses, names, and places of origin of the people in the surrounding units, as well as the various newspapers and magazines they subscribed to, and made a delivery route map.

One day, while delivering mail in a deep valley with no village in front and no shop behind, a heavy rain poured down. Xuan quickly took off his uniform, wrapped the letters, and hugged them tightly as he stumbled along the narrow path. When he appeared in front of the recipient like a mud man, a woman said, "Look at you, kid, you risked your life for all of us!"

As the saying goes, "A son travels a thousand miles, and his mother worries." Once, Xuan suddenly encountered a letter from Hebei addressed to "Beijing Shidu Tian Erwa," with no detailed address or postal code for the recipient. Xuan, holding this letter, searched for three days but could not find the recipient. Upon returning to the garrison, he heard that there were more than 50 newly recruited young workers in Coal Construction. Thus, he took the letter and asked along the way, finally finding the young worker nicknamed Tian Erwa. This young worker, Tian Erwa, was an only child. After going out, his elderly mother had a heart attack. Fortunately, Xuan delivered the letter, allowing him to return home in time.

Over the past three years, Xuan Xiuhua has walked more than 40,000 miles on the rugged mountain roads, delivering more than 15,000 letters, 1,000 mailbags, and 800 remittance slips for the people. He has warmed the hearts of the mountain people with a burning heart. He was awarded the honorable title of "National New Long March Pioneer" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and has been named an outstanding Communist Party member every year.

    情洒山乡的“鸿雁”
    赵宝玉
    在北京燕山深处的十渡山区，在京原线路列车钻山穿岭的隘口要道，分散驻守着一个个身着橄榄绿警服的铁道卫士。在他们当中，人称“山乡鸿雁”的玄绪华，是一名普通的武警通信员。
    二十出头的玄绪华，除了每天都要翻山越岭钻行隧道为战友们投递报刊、信件和购买日用品外，还坚持徒步20多里的山路，为驻地的车站、学校、敬老院等13个单位和群众义务投递报刊信件。
    每当玄绪华挎着邮包迈进邮电所的大门，眼看着那一叠叠厚厚的信件十天半月也送不到群众的手里时，他想，自己是部队的一名通信员，如果能在工作之余帮助群众解决通信难的问题，那该多好啊！他的想法，很快就得到了部队领导的支持。从此，玄绪华便当上了山乡群众的“义务邮递员”。
    虽说投递报刊、信件并不是件难事，可在山区就不那么容易。开始，小玄对分散居住在山区的群众都比较陌生，为了尽量少走弯路，使信件准确地能送到群众手中，他时常带着个小本子，对周围十几个单位人员的住址、姓名、原籍，以及他们订阅的各种报刊进行分类登记，并且自制了一幅投递路线图。
    一天，玄绪华送信走在一个前不着村，后不着店的深谷时，下起倾盆大雨，他赶忙脱下警服，把信件裹住，紧紧抱在怀里，跌跌撞撞地行进在羊肠小道上。当他像泥人一样出现在收信人面前时，一位大嫂心疼地说：“看你这孩子，为了我们大伙，连命都不顾了！”
    常言道：儿行千里母担忧。一次，小玄突然遇到一封从河北发来的“北京十渡田二娃”收的来信，小玄拿着这一封既无收信人详细地址，又无邮政编码的信件，连续找了三天都没有找到收信人，回驻地后，他听人说，煤建那儿有50多个新近招来的青工。于是，他又拿着这封信一路询问，终于找到了那个乳名叫田二娃的青工。这个名叫田二娃的青工，是个独生子，出远门后，年迈的母亲心脏病发作，幸亏小玄将信送到，才使他及时赶回家里。
    3年多来，玄绪华在崎岖的山道上徒步行程4万多里，为群众义务投递信件15000多封，邮包1000多个，汇款单800多个，他用一颗滚烫的心，温暖着山里人。他被团中央授予“全国新长征突击手”的光荣称号，并年年被评为优秀共产党员。
