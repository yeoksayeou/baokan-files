Yu De Gao, a platoon leader in a certain unit of the martial law troops, who gave up his chance of survival for the masses and took on the danger of death himself, was recently awarded the honorable title of "Guardian of the Republic" by the Central Military Commission.

On the afternoon of June 3, Yu De Gao's unit was ordered to march from Beijing's Nanyuan to Tiananmen Square to clear the area.

The convoy encountered difficulties as soon as it set off. Some rioters incited uninformed crowds to set up roadblocks and surround the military vehicles. Yu De Gao noticed that the rear of the truck had no cover, making it easy for people to throw things and injure the soldiers, so he pushed the new recruits to the front of the truck and stood at the rear himself. At Majiabu South Road, the convoy was blocked and could not proceed. The higher-ups ordered them to disembark and move eastward along the Third Ring Road on foot, feigning an attack to cover the main force. Yu De Gao quickly made a detailed deployment for the entire platoon and then led three squad leaders to the front of the formation. When the troops reached the railway crossing at Muxiyuan, a group of rioters took advantage of the darkness to throw stones from the embankment at them. The soldiers' helmets were hit with a clattering sound. Yu De Gao immediately rushed to the left side of the formation, directing the soldiers to spread out and quickly pass through the area. The thugs realized he was the commander and rained stones down on him. His waist and left leg were hit, bleeding profusely. He did not retreat but continued to command until all the soldiers had passed the railway crossing, then he left.

At around midnight on June 4, the troops advanced north along the line from Muxiyuan to Yongdingmen. By this time, the soldiers had gone 12 hours without food, and many were exhausted and falling behind. Meanwhile, a group of rioters followed about 10 meters behind the formation, occasionally throwing bricks and bottles. He volunteered to take on the rear guard duty. He loudly reminded the new recruits, "Hurry up! Don't fall behind!" and took turns helping the soldiers carry rifles and compressed food containers. Running along, Yu De Gao noticed that the new recruit Chen Lianxi was struggling to keep up and was about to fall behind. He quickly stepped over and put his right arm around Chen's arm, pulling him along. Then, he noticed another new recruit, Jia Qinglong, who was injured in three places and limping, falling behind the formation. Yu De Gao rushed over, took Jia's semi-automatic rifle, and put it on his own shoulder. He then took Jia's arm with his left hand and followed the formation forward.

Soon, the troops marched 7 kilometers and reached Zhushikou. While breaking through a roadblock, a 17-year-old new recruit, Jiang Xiaoping, was hit in the left leg by a stone thrown by a rioter and fell to the ground. Yu De Gao quickly bent down to pull up Jiang. At that moment, a rioter took advantage of Yu De Gao's distraction and swung an iron bar at his head, leaving a four to five centimeter long gash on the back of his head. Then, a brick flew in and knocked out two of Yu De Gao's front teeth, causing him to collapse to the ground. Later, thanks to the timely rescue of two plainclothes police officers, Yu De Gao narrowly escaped death.

"Being a soldier means sacrifice and dedication. When the party, the country, and the people need us, we must be willing to dedicate everything. This is the duty of a soldier," Yu De Gao often said to his comrades, and he lived by these words.

On the morning of May 20, the unit received orders to go to Beijing to carry out martial law. Yu De Gao was the first to submit a request to the party branch. Just as he was leading the entire platoon to prepare for the departure, he received a letter from his wife informing him that she had accidentally fallen and miscarried and was hospitalized. Shortly after, he received a telegram saying, "Mother has cancer, return immediately." The sudden double misfortune made this tough man shed tears. But he thought, "The republic is in danger, and it needs us soldiers to fulfill our sacred duty and protect the peace of the republic." He sent a telegram to his family saying, "Training is intense, cannot return," and sent 100 yuan, resolutely leading the entire platoon on the march to Beijing.

Yu De Gao expressed his loyalty to the party and the people with his blood. Now, severe brain trauma has caused Yu De Gao to temporarily lose his memory, but the people will never forget him.

    爱心献给人民
    ——记“共和国卫士”、空军某部排长游德高
    新华社记者　孙茂庆　新华社通讯员　李运斗
    游德高，这个把生的希望让给群众，把死的危险留给自己的戒严部队某部排长，最近被中央军委授予“共和国卫士”的光荣称号。
    6月3日下午，游德高所在部队奉命由北京南苑向天安门广场开进，执行清场任务。
    车队一上路就走得很艰难。一些暴徒煽动不明真相的群众，设置路障，围堵军车。游德高见车尾没有篷布遮挡，容易被砸伤，就把新战士推到车厢前部，自己站到车尾。在马家堡南路，车队受阻无法前进。上级命令他们连下车，徒步沿三环路向东佯动，掩护大部队通过。游德高迅速对全排作了周密的部署，然后自己带领三个班长走在队伍的最前面。当部队行至木樨园铁道口时，左侧有一伙暴徒趁着黑暗，用路基上的石块向他们猛砸，战士们的头盔被砸得乒乓直响。游德高立即冲到队伍左侧，指挥战士拉开距离，快速通过这一地段。歹徒们发现他是指挥员，石块雨点般地朝他打来，他的腰部和左腿被砸得鲜血直流。他毫不退缩，坚持指挥，直到战士全部通过铁路道口，他才离开。
    4日凌晨零点左右，部队沿木樨园、永定门一线向北开进。这时，战士们已经12个小时没有吃饭，不少人体力不支，开始掉队了。而一伙暴徒却气焰嚣张地尾随在队伍后方10多米处，不时投来砖块、酒瓶子。他主动要求担负后卫任务。他一边大声地提醒新战士：“快跟上！不要掉队！”一边轮换着帮战士扛机枪和压缩干粮筒。跑着跑着，游排长发现新战士陈连喜跑不动，要掉队了，他大步跨过去，用右臂挽住小陈的胳膊，拉着他跑。接着，他又发现三处负伤的新战士贾庆龙走路一拐一拐，落到了队伍的后边。游德高赶过去，把小贾的半自动步枪抓过来，背到自己肩上，用左手挽起小贾的胳膊，跟着队伍往前赶。
    紧接着，部队经过7公里强行军，到达珠市口，在冲过一道路障时，年仅17岁的新战士江小平被暴徒投掷的石头击中左腿，倒了下去，游德高赶紧俯下身子拉起小江。这时，一个暴徒趁游德高不备，举起铁棒朝他头部猛砸，游的后脑勺被打出一条四五厘米长的血口子。接着又飞来一块砖头，游德高两颗门牙被砸掉，一头栽倒在地上。后来，多亏两名便衣警察冒死相救，游德高才幸免于难。
    “当兵就意味着奉献和牺牲，当党和国家、人民需要的时候，要甘愿奉献自己的一切，这是军人的天职。”游德高常对战友们讲这番话，他也是这样做的。
    5月20日上午，部队接到了赴京执行戒严任务的命令。游德高第一个向党支部交了请战书。正当他带领全排作出发前准备工作时，收到妻子的来信，得知妻子不慎摔伤、流产住院的消息，紧接着又收到一封“母患癌症，速回”的电报。突如其来的双重不幸，使游德高这个硬汉子落下了眼泪。但他想到，共和国正处于危难之际，正需要我们军人履行神圣职责，保卫共和国的安宁。他给家里发了一封“训练紧，不能回”的电报，并寄去100元钱，毅然带领全排踏上了进京的征程。
    游德高用自己的热血表达了他忠于党、忠于人民的赤子之心。现在，严重的脑震荡使游德高暂时失去了记忆，可是，人民是永远不会忘记他的。
