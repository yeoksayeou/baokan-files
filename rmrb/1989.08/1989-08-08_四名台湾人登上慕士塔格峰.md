Following the successful ascent of a man and a woman from Taiwan on July 24th, four more Taiwanese individuals have conquered Mount Muztagh Ata in two separate groups.

The first group consisted of Mǎ Yùshēn and Lín Guāngyàn, who reached the summit on July 28th. The second group, Wú Jǐnxiōng and Lín Ruìxián, achieved the same feat on July 29th. Additionally, on July 28th, a Sherpa guide from Nepal who was hired also reached the summit with the Taiwanese climbers. This information was relayed by the Taiwanese mountaineering team that recently withdrew from the Muztagh Ata region.

In total, six Taiwanese members of the Muztagh Ata Mountaineering Team from Taiwan have successfully climbed the peak. This team, composed of 13 members from the Taiwanese mountaineering community, organized the expedition themselves.
