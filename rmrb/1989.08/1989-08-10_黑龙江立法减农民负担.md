	Heilongjiang Province has recently passed the "Heilongjiang Farmers' Burden Management Regulations," bringing the protection of farmers' legal rights and the reduction of their burdens into the realm of legal regulation.

	The "Heilongjiang Farmers' Burden Management Regulations" stipulate that farmers, in addition to paying taxes and fees as required by law and fulfilling their due obligations, shall not be subjected to any additional burdens by any department. The scope and standards for rural fees within the entire province shall be reviewed by the provincial agricultural commission in conjunction with the price and financial departments and submitted to the provincial government for approval. Village committees, cooperative economic organizations, and farmers have the right to resist and report or accuse any behavior that violates the regulations and arbitrarily increases farmers' burdens.

    黑龙江立法减农民负担
    据新华社哈尔滨八月十日电（记者张广远）黑龙江省人大日前通过了《黑龙江农民负担管理条例》，把保护农民的合法权益、减轻农民负担纳入了法制轨道。
    《黑龙江农民负担管理条例》规定，农民除依法缴纳税、费和承担应尽的义务外，任何部门不得增加农民的负担。全省范围的农村收费项目和标准，由省农委同物价、财政部门审核，报省政府批准。村民委员会、合作经济组织、农民对违反《条例》擅自增加农民负担的行为，有权抵制和检举、控告。
