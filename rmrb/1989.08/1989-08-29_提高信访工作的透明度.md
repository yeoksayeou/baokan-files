	In recent years, various levels of party and government departments have, through petition work, uncovered many major cases, doing a lot of work to combat corruption. However, as reform and opening up deepens, the role of petition work cannot meet the needs of the changing situation, and there are some urgent problems that need to be solved:

	First, there is secrecy and closure. This refers to the secrecy surrounding the review, transfer, and handling of petition cases, as well as the secrecy in determining the nature and punishment of cases. Many people do not know the rules and regulations regarding the division of labor and jurisdiction in petition work, leading to random seeking of help, many anonymous letters, and frequent instances of bypassing levels and repeated petitions.

	Second, there is lax discipline enforcement. Currently, some cases involving leading cadres are often difficult for the public to report, difficult to investigate and gather evidence, and difficult to handle fairly.

	Third, informants have three fears: fear that the case will be handled with "official protection," making it difficult to solve the problem; fear that solving the problem will be "ineffective," leading to retaliation; and fear of being accused of false accusations and framing if the report is not detailed.

	The formation of the above problems is partly due to the low transparency of petition work, making it difficult for the public to supervise.

	So, how can we improve the transparency of petition work?

	We need to break away from the traditional notions of secrecy and closure, and make the petition work system public to the people. We should regularly disclose the handling of cases and the results of case processing (except for those that cannot be disclosed). This way, we can speed up the case handling process and improve the quality of case handling.

	We need to change the passive and evasive bureaucratic style of "waiting for petitions" and "handling cases in the office," and establish a petition network and feedback system. We should open the doors of petition work, and establish a system for leaders and petition workers at all levels to visit the people. We should ensure that there is someone in charge at every level and someone to manage at every level.

	We need to change the practice of handling cases merely to close them, and ensure that cases are closed on time and with high quality. We need to change the situation of mutual buck-passing and reluctance to take responsibility, actively coordinate and cooperate, form a collective supervision pattern, and dare to help the people solve their problems.

	We need to change the practice of dropping cases once they are closed, and do a good job of follow-up visits and reviews. We should select petition cases with educational significance, and expand their influence through newspapers and radio, combining public supervision with media supervision.

    提高信访工作的透明度
    近年来，各级党和政府部门通过信访工作提供的线索，查处了很多大案要案，为惩治腐败做了很多工作。但随着改革开放的深入，信访工作的作用还不能适应形势发展的需要，存在着一些亟待解决的问题：
    一是神秘封闭。即对信访案件的阅批转办神秘，定性量纪神秘。不少群众也不知道信访工作分工归口等规章制度，有病乱求医，匿名信多，越级、重复信访多。
    二是执纪不严。现在，有些涉及领导干部的案件，往往是群众举报难，调查取证难，公正处理难。
    三是举报者心存疑虑有“三怕”。即一怕案件处理“官官相护”，问题难以解决；二怕解决问题“不疼不痒”，反遭打击报复；三怕检举不细，背上诬告陷害的罪名。
    形成上述问题的原因之一，在于信访工作透明度不高，群众无法监督。
    那么，怎样提高信访工作的透明度呢？
    要破除神秘化、封闭式的传统观念，向人民群众公开信访工作制度，定期公开案件查处情况，公开办案处理结果（不能公开的除外）。这样做，就能加快办案进度和提高办案质量。
    要转变“坐等信访”、“坐堂办案”的推挡式机关作风，健全信访网络和回访制度，敞开信访工作的大门，健全各级领导和信访工作人员下访制度。做到层层有人抓，级级有人管。
    要改变为结案而办案的应付交差的做法，把“按期”和“优质”结案率落到实处。要改变互相推诿怕负责任的扯皮状况，积极主动协调配合，形成群体监督格局，勇于为群众分忧解难。
    要改变一结案就甩手的做法，搞好“回访回查”。选择有教育意义的信访案例，通过报刊、广播扩大影响，把群众监督与舆论监督结合起来。
