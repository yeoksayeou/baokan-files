The People's Daily, Duisburg, August 24th

Wiedau Sports Park, covering an area of 3 square kilometers, includes a stadium that can accommodate 30,000 people, two lakes for water skiing and swimming, and a 2,000-meter standard rowing course adjacent to the lakes, which is one of the best rowing venues in the world. Additionally, there is a swimming pool and an indoor ice sports hall, making it an ideal location for hosting comprehensive sports events and training camps. The attached sports school frequently provides services for national team training.

Duisburg took over the hosting rights for this year's University Games from São Paulo, Brazil, fully considering the facilities of this park. Originally, this land belonged to the Krupp Company. In 1919, it "sold" the land to the city of Duisburg for a symbolic 1 Mark, with the condition that it could only be used for the development of sports. Over the past 70 years, the sports park has been continuously expanded and updated, resulting in its current form.

Under the initiative of the West German University Sports Federation, students from Cologne, Essen, and Bochum have started publishing a "University Games News" newspaper. They said, "Since this is a sports event for university students, why shouldn't West German university students take this opportunity to practice news writing?" With the support of the organizing committee, the newspaper was published on August 23rd, with a daily circulation of 5,000 copies. Each article is published in both German and English, featuring photos, reports, and match commentaries, making it quite professional.

I heard that the medical center had invited Dr. "David-Wet-Zhong Sun" from the Essen Medical School to serve as an acupuncturist and masseur for the Games. I thought it would be an elderly man, but upon meeting him, he turned out to be a young man. He was treating a Ugandan female athlete's left leg. The athlete had recently injured her knee joint, and after several treatments, there was no improvement, so she sought help from a Chinese masseur. As he massaged and treated her, he chatted with me. It turned out that he had been in West Germany for only two months, studying for a doctorate at the National Sports Commission's Training Bureau, focusing on the treatment and rehabilitation of sports injuries. He said, "Chinese medicine's massage and acupuncture, based on the theory of meridians, either tonify or disperse, which is completely different from Western massage. Foreign athletes are not familiar with this, but once they try it, the effects are quite good." In the past two days, he had treated more than a dozen patients, and they were all quite satisfied.

    世界大学生运动会花絮
    1个马克买来的体育公园
    威道体育公园占地3平方公里，除了一个可容3万人的运动场之外，还有两块湖面供水橇和游泳用，举行赛艇比赛的2000米标准艇道紧靠前两个湖边，是世界上最好的赛艇场地，此外还有游泳池和一个室内冰上运动馆，是举行综合性运动会和集训的理想之地。它附设的体育学校经常为国家队集训服务。
    杜伊斯堡从巴西圣保罗接过本届大学生运动会主办权，是充分考虑到了这个公园设施条件的。这块地原来属于克虏伯公司所有，1919年它把这块地“卖”给了杜伊斯堡市，收了象征性的1个马克，条件是只能用于发展体育运动。70年来，体育公园不断扩大更新，才有了当今的面貌。
    大学生为大学生运动员办报
    在西德大学生体联发起下，科隆、埃森和波鸿14个男女大学生办起了一份“大学生运动会新闻”报。他们说，既然是大学生们的体育活动，西德大学生何不借此机会锻炼一下新闻写作呢？在组委会的支持下，8月23日这份报纸出版了，每天5000份，每篇文章都有德英两种文字同版刊出，有照片，有报道，有比赛评论，像模像样的。
    来自北京的针灸推拿大夫
    听说医疗中心里请来了埃森医学院的“戴维—卫中·孙博士”在运动会上担任针灸推拿大夫，我心想大概是个老先生，谁知一见面，竟是个小伙子。他正在给一个乌干达女运动员治疗左腿。这个运动员不久前髁关节扭伤，这两天治了几次不见好，找中国人推拿来了。他一边给她推拿按摩，一边跟我聊。原来他到西德才两个月，是从国家体委训练局到这里读博士学位的，研究的就是运动创伤治疗和康复。他说：“中医的推拿针灸，按经络学说或泻或补，与西方的按摩完全不同。外国运动员不了解这一套，可一试效果都不错。”这两天他已治疗十几个病人，他们都挺满意。　本报记者　江建国
