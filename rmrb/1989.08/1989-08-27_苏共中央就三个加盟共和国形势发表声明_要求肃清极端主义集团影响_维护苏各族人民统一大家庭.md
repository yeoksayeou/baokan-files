The CPSU Central Committee has issued a statement on the current situation in the three Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, calling for decisive measures to eliminate the influence of extremist groups and maintain the unity of the Soviet people.

The statement, released by TASS on August 26, notes that the situation in these republics is becoming increasingly alarming, with the people facing serious threats as nationalist leaders drive them towards the abyss.

On August 22, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet's "Commission to Study the Consequences of the 1939 Soviet-German Pact" declared that the pact was illegal and invalid. It also stated that the 1940 declaration by the Lithuanian parliament on joining the Soviet Union and the 1940 Soviet law on accepting Lithuania into the Soviet Union were without legal force. On August 23, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-German pact, these three republics held large-scale demonstrations, with some extremists chanting slogans such as "Down with the CPSU" and "Separate from the Soviet Union."

The CPSU Central Committee's statement points out that the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet's commission's declaration is not an isolated incident. It is related to the recent stubborn pursuit of separatist lines by certain forces in the three Baltic republics. Some nationalist and extremist groups are exploiting democracy and openness to incite nationalist sentiments, attempting to separate these three republics from the Soviet Union. These individuals have anti-Soviet and anti-socialist intentions, aiming to establish political organizations similar to those during the bourgeois and fascist occupation periods. Some media outlets have become breeding grounds for nationalist sentiments.

The statement notes that these nationalist elements have also established contacts with foreign organizations, allowing them to interfere in the republics' internal affairs and act as advisors. The statement points out that these forces have become so brazen as to pass laws in the republics' state power organs that contradict the principles of the Soviet federation.

The statement believes that the leaders of these republics have failed to stop the development of negative trends and have not maintained a principled stance. Some party committees have shrunk back in the face of difficulties, and some have even pandered to nationalist sentiments.

The CPSU Central Committee calls on the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and Communist Party members in these republics to recognize the situation and stop the deterioration of the situation.

The statement emphasizes that maintaining the unity of the Soviet people and the unity of the CPSU ranks is the common responsibility of the people across the country.

    苏共中央就三个加盟共和国形势发表声明
    要求肃清极端主义集团影响  维护苏各族人民统一大家庭
    新华社莫斯科8月26日电  苏共中央就苏联波罗的海沿岸爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛3个加盟共和国当前的形势发表声明，要求采取坚决措施肃清极端主义集团对那里的改革的影响。塔斯社26日播发了这项声明。声明指出，上述3个共和国的形势越来越令人不安，那里的人民面临着严重的威胁，民族主义首领们正在把他们推向深渊。
    8月22日，立陶宛共和国最高苏维埃“研究1939年苏德条约及其后果委员会”宣布，这一条约是非法的、无效的，并称1940年7月21日立陶宛议会关于立陶宛加入苏联的宣言以及1940年8月3日苏联关于接纳立陶宛加入苏联的法律，均无法律效力。8月23日苏德条约签订50周年这一天，这3个共和国举行大规模示威游行，一些极端分子打出“打倒苏共”、“脱离苏联”等口号。
    苏共中央在声明中指出，立陶宛最高苏维埃上述委员会的声明并非个别事件，它与波罗的海沿岸3个共和国的某些势力近来顽固地推行分立主义路线有关。一些民族主义和极端主义集团利用民主和公开性，竭力挑起民族主义情绪，妄图使这3个共和国脱离苏联。这些人怀有反苏反社会主义目的，企图建立与资产阶级和法西斯占领时期相类似的政治组织。有些舆论工具则成为煽动民族主义情绪的温床。
    苏共中央的声明注意到，这些民族主义分子还同国外的组织建立了联系，让它们参与共和国的内部事务，让他们当顾问。声明指出，这些势力的活动已嚣张到导致在共和国国家政权机关通过了与苏联的联邦制原则相违背的法令的地步。
    声明认为，这些共和国的领导人未能制止消极倾向的发展，未能坚持原则立场。部分党委则在困难面前畏缩，有些人甚至讨好民族主义情绪。
    苏共中央呼吁这些共和国的工人阶级、农民、知识分子和共产党员要认清形势，制止事态向坏的方向发展。
    声明表示，维护苏联各族人民统一的大家庭和苏共各支队伍的团结是全国人民共同的责任。
