In recent years, rural processing industries have developed rapidly. In our county, there are over 230 small graphite processing factories built by farmers in the townships of Banchang and Xiaguan. For convenience in water usage and discharge, these factories are all built along the riverbanks, discharging approximately 700 to 800 tons of wastewater into the river daily.

Currently, the river flows with black water, the ditches by the village carry black water, and the fields are irrigated with black water. Villagers use black water for washing clothes and vegetables. Over 5,000 people in Xiaguan Township use the black water flowing down from upstream. At present, villagers are extremely distressed when it comes to water usage. They have repeatedly reported the issue to relevant departments, but the problem remains unsolved.

    加工石墨　吐黑排污
    板厂夏馆村民苦难言
    近两年来，农村加工业发展很快，我县板厂、夏馆两乡镇农民兴建的小石墨厂就有230多家。为了用水、排水方便，这些石墨厂都沿河岸而建，每天大约向河内排放污水七八百吨。
    现在，河里流的是黑水，村边沟渠淌的是黑水、稻田灌的也是黑水，农民洗衣、洗菜用的是黑水。夏馆镇5000多人用的是上游流下来的黑水。目前，村民们一提到吃水就叫苦不迭。他们曾向有关部门反映多次，但至今没解决问题。
