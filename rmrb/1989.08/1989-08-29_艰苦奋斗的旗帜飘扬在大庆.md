Daqing has stood tall on the northern wilderness for 30 years. Over these three decades, it has produced 1 billion tons of crude oil, nearly 1 billion tons of petrochemical products, and contributed nearly 100 billion yuan to the national treasury (equivalent to 22 times the national investment). Particularly, after achieving an annual crude oil production of 50 million tons, Daqing has maintained stable production for 14 years, a feat unparalleled in the world!

In the late 1970s, high-rise buildings replaced the former "mud huts" in Daqing. Wide roads, bustling cars, and beautiful architectural groups transformed the once rustic mining area into a modern new city. Amidst these changes, Daqing continues to uphold the banner of hard work and perseverance.

Hard work starts from the leadership. The offices of various levels of leaders in the oil field do not have sofas or air conditioners. The office of the Petrochemical General Plant (the command center of a super-large enterprise with an annual output value of over 2 billion yuan) is still located in the staff dormitory. Leaders going deep into the front lines to work and live with the workers is a long-standing tradition in Daqing.

The spirit of hard work and perseverance permeates every aspect of life and production in Daqing. During times of power shortages, each household is allowed only one 45-watt light bulb. To save oil for the nation, Daqing's public buses are equipped with natural gas tanks.

Daqing's hard work and perseverance are also evident in the continuous promotion of the spirit of "if there are conditions, go ahead; if there are no conditions, create conditions and go ahead." When installing ethylene equipment, to increase production and save resources, they broke the conventional rules and invented and implemented the "reverse startup method." This not only set a precedent in China for large-scale petrochemical projects to balance income and expenditure in the same year but also saved 50 million yuan just during the trial run. Even more challenging is solving the problem of maintaining stable production of 50 million tons of crude oil for another 10 years. To achieve stable production, old wells need to be tapped for potential. This is no easy task for an oil field entering the high-water period! A 35-year-old assistant worker, Pan Shijin, studied a large amount of literature and conducted extensive investigations. He developed the "flow restriction fracturing new technology," which can increase the production of each oil well by 30% to 60%. Oil layers that were previously considered uneconomical or difficult to exploit have become the backup oil sources for the stable and high production of the oil field. This single item alone can directly yield a benefit of 1.3 billion yuan.

The practice of "passing on skills" to cultivate a new generation of hardworking successors is also commendable. In Daqing, some people would rather let their romantic relationships fall through than leave their hardship posts; some, despite their old age and frail health, voluntarily go to the wilderness hundreds of miles away to work for years; and countless others have given up or sacrificed personal interests for scientific and technological breakthroughs. These are the new-age "Iron Men," shining brightly in people's eyes and hearts as vibrant banners.

    艰苦奋斗的旗帜飘扬在大庆
    ●武培真
    大庆，在北国荒原上屹立了30个春秋。30年来，生产原油10亿吨、石化产品近亿吨、财政上缴近千亿元（相当于国家投资的22倍）。尤其原油年产实现5000万吨后，已稳产14年，堪称世界奇迹！
    70年代末，大庆片片高楼取代昔日“干打垒”，宽阔的路，穿梭的车，漂亮的建筑群，把以往带着浓重乡土气的矿区打扮成一座现代新城。在这种情况下，大庆一如既往高举着艰苦奋斗旗帜。
    艰苦奋斗，领导带头。油田各级领导的办公室，不见沙发，没有空调。石化总厂的办公室（这是年产值20多亿元的特大企业的指挥部），至今设在职工宿舍。领导干部深入第一线与工人“三同”，是大庆一直保持的老传统。
    大庆的艰苦创业之风遍布生活、生产各领域。电紧缺时，每户只点一盏灯，不许超过45瓦。为给国家节油，大庆的公共汽车又背上天然气包。
    大庆的艰苦奋斗，还表现在继续发扬“有条件上，没有条件创造条件也要上”的拚搏精神。安装乙烯设备，为了增产节约，他们打破常规，发明、实施“逆式开车法”，不仅在我国开创大型石化工程当年收支平衡的先例，而且仅试车就节约5000万元。更为难者，算是解决5000万吨原油再稳产10年这一课题。要稳产，旧井须挖潜。这对于进入高含水期的油田来说，决非易事！35岁的助工潘时景，苦读大量书籍资料，广泛调查，研究出“限流法压裂新工艺”，使每口油井可增产30％至60％，过去认为没有开采价值或很难开采的薄油层成为油田稳产高产的后备油源。只此一项，直接效益可达13亿元。
    用“传帮带”培养一批又一批艰苦创业的接班人，更令人欣慰。在大庆，有的宁可对象吹掉，也不愿离开艰苦岗位；有的不顾年迈体衰，自愿到一二百里外的荒草甸子上长年值班；还有无数为科技攻关，放弃或牺牲个人利益的人。这是新时期的铁人，是人们眼前和心目中一面面鲜艳夺目的旗帜。
