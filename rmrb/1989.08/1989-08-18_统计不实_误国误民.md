Title: Falsified Statistics: Misleading the Nation and the People

To ensure the fulfillment of this year's grain procurement contracts, we visited a township and held a discussion with the local officials. The township Party secretary and several other leaders unanimously stated that the grain procurement task was heavy and difficult to complete. We bluntly pointed out that the township's grain production had increased year after year, and based on the procurement quota and the commercialization rate of the total grain production, the task was not heavy. To our surprise, the township Party secretary bluntly said, "Do you think the production figures we reported are genuine? There are discrepancies. Because the county set a target management percentage for us, there are rewards for increased production and penalties for decreased production. We work hard all year, so why should we forgo the bonus and face penalties?!" Another township official reflected: Last year, after the wheat harvest, the reported production figures did not meet the county's target requirements. The county leaders even came to the township government and insisted on reporting the production figures as 250 kilograms per mu, despite the township government's figures, which were verified through sampling surveys by cadres and technical personnel, being 225 kilograms per mu.

The falsification of grain production figures is just one aspect. In some places, there are also varying degrees of the following problems: the output value of township enterprises is based on "looking at the beams"; farmers' per capita income is "roughly the same"; family planning and population growth are "made up out of thin air"; fiscal revenue and expenditure are "rough estimates."

Have we not paid enough for the "empty talk" and "wind of exaggeration"!

    统计不实　误国误民
    因为落实今年的粮食定购合同，我们到一个乡和干部座谈，乡党委书记和几位领导人异口同声说粮食定购任务重，难以完成。我们直言提出该乡粮食年年增产，按定购数和粮食总产的商品率计算，任务并不大。不料乡党委书记直言不讳地说：“你道我们报的产量是实的吗？有水分。因为县里给我们定了目标管理百分赛，增产有奖，减产则罚，我们辛辛苦苦一年，干嘛放着奖金不拿而挨罚呢？！”另一个乡干部反映：该乡前一年麦收后报产量数未达到县里要求的目标，县里领导竟亲临乡政府，硬是把乡政府经过干部和科技人员抽样调查核实的产量每亩225公斤，上报成250公斤才算罢休。粮食产量上报不实仅是一个方面。有些地方也还不同程度存在这样的问题：乡镇企业产值是“看房檩”数；农民人均收入是“大概齐”；计划生育和人口增长是“凭空造”；财政收支是“大估堆”。
    “假大空”、“浮夸风”，让我们付出的代价还不够吗！
