When mentioning Côte d'Ivoire, people both praise its past economic miracle and lament its recent difficulties. Indeed, from 1960, the year of its independence, until the 1970s, Côte d'Ivoire's economy experienced a miraculous development. Per capita income rose from less than $150 in 1960 to over $1,200, earning it the title of "oasis in the desert." However, since entering the 1980s, due to the sharp decline in international market prices for primary products and the burden of massive external debts, Côte d'Ivoire's economic situation has been a mix of joy and sorrow. In 1989, the per capita GDP is estimated to be between $800 and $1,000.

What caused the dramatic changes in Côte d'Ivoire's economic situation? Manso Mangou, Deputy Director of the Economic and Social Research Center of Côte d'Ivoire, who attended the "International Conference on Development Strategies for Third World Countries," told the reporter: "Côte d'Ivoire's economic development benefited from opening up to the outside world. By introducing capital and technology from abroad and exporting products, Côte d'Ivoire's economy was able to develop at a high speed." People still remember that at the time of independence in 1960, while other African countries were implementing radical "nationalization" policies, Côte d'Ivoire not only adopted an attitude of retaining, protecting, and utilizing French enterprises, funds, and technical personnel but also attracted foreign funds and technical personnel that had been driven away by neighboring countries. Côte d'Ivoire used extremely favorable conditions and treatment, the method of "using honey instead of chili," to attract a large amount of foreign investment and aid. It was these continuous inflows of foreign investment and aid that enabled Côte d'Ivoire's economy to develop rapidly. Especially in the ten years after independence, Côte d'Ivoire's GDP grew at an average annual rate of 8%, increasing from 13.05 billion West African CFA francs in 1960 to 32.93 billion West African CFA francs in 1969. Although the annual population growth rate during the same period was as high as 3%, the per capita GDP growth rate still reached 5% per year.

Ten years of development not only greatly enhanced Côte d'Ivoire's economic strength but also brought about significant changes in its economic structure. Côte d'Ivoire began to reverse its single-economy situation. Industry and the service sector developed, with the number of industrial enterprises increasing from 180 in 1960 to over 700 in 1988. The cumulative investment total reached 71.7 billion West African CFA francs in 1970 and increased to 1,756 billion by 1986; business revenue increased from 13 billion West African CFA francs at the time of independence to 1,462 billion in 1986.

Although Côte d'Ivoire's economy created a "miracle," its economic model also had significant weaknesses: it was too heavily influenced by external market fluctuations and overly dependent on foreign investment. For example, from 1975 to 1979, consecutive years of good weather increased Côte d'Ivoire's cocoa and coffee production, while international market prices for coffee and cocoa rose sharply. In 1977, the prices of coffee and cocoa were 3.6 times and 2.2 times those of 1975, respectively, causing Côte d'Ivoire's export income to surge from $1.34 billion in 1975 to $2.674 billion in 1977. However, starting from the late 1970s, due to the economic crisis in Western developed countries, international market prices for raw materials, including agricultural products, fell sharply, causing Côte d'Ivoire's export income to suffer huge losses year after year.

However, the biggest blow to Côte d'Ivoire's economy was debt. Manso Mangou said: "In the first stage of economic development, we borrowed a large amount of external debt, which now needs to be repaid, causing great difficulties for our economic development." In 1977, Côte d'Ivoire's external debt was less than $2.7 billion, but by 1985, the total external debt had reached $8.4 billion, accounting for 86% of the GDP that year, with per capita debt of $800; the repayment amounts for 1986 and 1987 were $906 million and $1.17 billion, respectively, both accounting for about 30% of export income. Now, Côte d'Ivoire has become one of the 25 most indebted countries in the world.

    科特迪瓦经济的喜与忧
    本报记者　杨贵兰
    提起科特迪瓦，人们既对其曾经出现的经济奇迹交口称赞，又对它近年来所遇到的困难深表惋惜。的确，自一九六○年独立至七十年代的二十年间，科特迪瓦的经济得到了奇迹般的发展，人均收入由一九六○年的不足一百五十美元一度增加到一千二百多美元，赢得了“沙漠中的绿洲”的美称。然而，进入八十年代以来，由于国际市场初级产品价格大幅度下跌和巨额外债缠身，科特迪瓦的经济形势是喜中有忧，一九八九年人均国内生产总值预计在八百到一千美元之间。
    科特迪瓦经济形势的戏剧性变化究竟是怎么回事？出席“第三世界国家发展战略国际讨论会”的科特迪瓦经济社会研究中心副主任芒索·芒古先生告诉记者：“科特迪瓦的经济发展受益于对外开放。由于从外国引进资本和技术，向国外输出产品，科特迪瓦的经济才得以高速发展。”人们还记得，一九六○年独立之初，正当其它一些非洲国家竞相实行激进的“国有化”政策时，科特迪瓦不仅对法国的企业、资金和技术人员采取挽留、保护和利用的态度，而且还将邻国吓跑的外国资金和技术人员引进了国内。科特迪瓦以极其优惠的条件和待遇，即“靠用蜂蜜而不是辣椒”的办法大量吸引外资和外援。正是这些源源不断的外资、外援才使科特迪瓦的经济得以突飞猛进地发展。尤其是在独立后的十来年间，科特迪瓦的国内生产总值每年以百分之八的平均数递增，由一九六○年的一千三百○五亿西非法郎增加到一九六九年的三千二百九十三亿西非法郎，虽然同期的人口年增长率高达百分之三，但国内生产总值人均年增长率仍高达百分之五。
    十年的发展不仅使科特迪瓦的经济实力大大增强，而且也使其经济结构发生了较大变化。科特迪瓦的单一经济局面开始有所扭转。工业和服务行业得到了发展，各类工业企业由一九六○年的一百八十家增至一九八八年的七百多家。累计投资总额于一九七○年已达七百一十七亿西非法郎，一九八六年又增至一万七千五百六十亿；营业额由独立之初的一百三十亿西非法郎增至一九八六年的一万四千六百二十亿。
    科特迪瓦的经济虽然创造了“奇迹”，但其经济模式也存在着极大弱点：受外部市场行情变化影响太大，对外国投资依赖过重。例如，一九七五年至一九七九年间，连年的风调雨顺使科特迪瓦的可可、咖啡产量猛增，而国际市场的咖啡和可可价格大幅度上升。一九七七年的咖啡和可可价格分别为一九七五年的三点六倍和二点二倍，科特迪瓦的出口收入因而由一九七五年的十三点四亿美元骤增至一九七七年的二十六点七四亿美元。但是，从七十年代末开始，由于西方发达国家转嫁经济危机，国际市场包括农产品在内的原料价格大幅度下跌，致使科特迪瓦的出口收入连年遭受巨大损失。
    然而，给科特迪瓦经济打击最大的还是债务。芒索·芒古先生说：“在经济发展的第一阶段，我们举借了大量外债，现在都要偿还，这给我们的经济发展造成了巨大困难。”一九七七年，科特迪瓦的外债不足二十七亿美元，而一九八五年的外债总额竟高达八十四亿美元，占当年国内生产总值的百分之八十六，人均负债八百美元；一九八六年和一九八七年还本付息额分别为九点○六亿和十一点七亿美元，均占出口收入的百分之三十左右。现在，科特迪瓦已经成了世界上二十五个负债最重的国家之一。
