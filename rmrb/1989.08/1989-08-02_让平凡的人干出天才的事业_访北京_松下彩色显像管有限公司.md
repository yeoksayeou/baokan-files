Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 2nd.

“It's truly unexpected that our company's first color picture tube production line, imported from abroad, could be completed and put into operation in Beijing during the days of the counter-revolutionary riot, and even two months ahead of the contract deadline.” Zhang Zhongwen, the Chinese deputy general manager of Beijing Panasonic Color Picture Tube Co., Ltd., could not hide his excitement during the interview.

Beijing Panasonic Color Picture Tube Co., Ltd. stands at the northern end of the Jiu Xiang Qiao area, known as the capital's electronics city, covering an area of 136,000 square meters. It is a joint venture established with an investment of 600 million yuan by four Chinese units, including the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Bank Trust and Investment Corporation, and two Japanese companies, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. and Matsushita Electronics Corporation. It is the largest joint venture between China and Japan.

Absorbing foreign capital is a shortcut to international economic cooperation. Vice General Manager Zhang Zhongwen said: If we were to invest in such a large-scale enterprise on our own, we would need at least 500 million yuan and a considerable amount of foreign exchange. Following the conventional construction speed, it would generally take 2 to 3 years. Due to the efforts of the Fourth Company of China Construction First Bureau and the Installation Company, it actually only took 1 year and 10 months. If managed according to traditional domestic concepts, 1,800 to 2,300 workers would be needed, and it would take 5 years to recover the entire investment. By absorbing foreign management experience, only 1,300 workers are needed, and it is expected to recover the entire investment within 4 years.

It is not an exaggeration to say that this modern factory and equipment of the 1980s level are among the top enterprises even in foreign countries. Entering the factory area, the establishment of world-class "CPT" (English abbreviation for color picture tube) slogans can be seen everywhere. The quality consciousness of "Panasonic" people, as well as the fast pace of work, indeed connect everyone together.

We came to the technical department's data testing room. The staff pressed the button, and the screen displayed red, green, and blue colors in succession, almost in their natural hues. The products that have just entered mass production have reached this level, and the Japanese side is also satisfied. In the explosion-proof testing room, a steel ball weighing about a pound was thrown from a distance of 1.8 meters and a height of 1.5 meters at an incline towards the glass shell. With the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy, producing a force of 200 to 300 kilograms, the steel ball struck the glass shell with a "bang" sound, leaving only a white spot mark at the impact point. The test result was 5 points, 2 points higher than the passing standard.

Here, whether it is technical personnel or workers, everyone has a sense of mission to accelerate the localization of our color TVs. Young worker Zhao Qingchun said that although the quality standards and inspection methods executed by various countries are somewhat similar, "strictness" is the common point. The key is to start from the details. For example, the 28 characteristic test parameters of the glass shell need to be tested within 90 seconds. My responsibility is: feedback information must be fast, and no product with problems should enter the market. Otherwise, the consumers will suffer, the factory's reputation will be damaged, and my own "job" will be in jeopardy. A young worker who had gone to Matsushita Electric Company in Japan for inspection and study told the reporter, "Our factory and equipment dare to compare with 'Panasonic,' but there is a big gap in management. Therefore, the company's leadership is putting effort into introducing and digesting technology, and this path is correct." Young female worker Huang Tao, this college graduate was originally assigned to work in a design institute and later applied to work here. Her feeling is: working here breaks the seniority-based concept, and the content of evaluating each person's performance includes business ability, labor discipline, employment rules, etc. Those with abilities will rise, and those without abilities will be eliminated. There is a fair chance of competition, which is quite inspiring.

During the interview, from the company's leadership to ordinary workers, they all praised the "business god" of "Panasonic." What is the "business god"? How did this company bring in the "business god"? Deputy General Manager Zhang Zhongwen answered, the so-called "business god," in the words of "Panasonic" people, is "the success or failure of a business lies in people," "to manufacture products, first 'manufacture' people." That is, what they often say, "let ordinary people achieve extraordinary feats."

Learning and borrowing "Panasonic's" management experience, combined with our own actual situation, has already begun to establish a system of holding monthly consultation meetings in the company. The main topics of the consultation meetings are centered around developing production and communicating the thoughts of leaders with workers, and workers with workers. Due to the lively and flexible form of the consultation meetings, they have now become a good form for this joint venture to carry out ideological education work.

Requiring everyone to have professional ethics, first of all, needs to respect people. He said that not long ago, 10 newly recruited workers in the company had their birthdays, and the workshop held a party for them. The general manager and department heads of the company came to congratulate them, and the people present were very moved.

Another experience borrowed from "Panasonic" is to establish a morning meeting system in the company, that is, to use the time for arranging work every morning to emphasize that every worker in each class, system, department, and section must strictly follow the industrial patriotism, striving spirit, and service spirit established by the company.

All of these are for the work of cultivating people. In fact, some of the content is the effective experience of some enterprises in the 1950s. Therefore, it is not difficult to do, and both cadres and workers are willing to accept it.

Cultivating and educating people, the key is to improve the overall quality of the enterprise and enhance the sense of mission of each person. Zhang Zhongwen said that the company adopts the method of training first and then assigning jobs for every newly recruited employee, thereby laying a good foundation for managing the joint venture. Of course, the potential to deepen enterprise management and seek benefits from management is still great. The per capita industrial output value of Beijing in 1988 was less than 30,000 yuan, and our company will strive to achieve a per capita sales value of 400,000 yuan next year.

It seems that the road to successfully managing a joint venture is indeed arduous and long.

    “让平凡的人干出天才的事业”
     ——访北京·松下彩色显像管有限公司
    本报记者　赵兴林
    “真没想到我们公司从国外引进的第一条彩色显像管生产线，能在北京发生反革命暴乱的日子里建成投产，而且比合同规定日期提前了两个月。”北京·松下彩色显像管有限公司中方副总经理张仲文接受采访时，抑制不住内心的激动。
    北京·松下彩色显像管有限公司，矗立在有首都电子城之称的酒仙桥地区北端，占地面积13.6万平方米。它是由北京工商银行信托投资公司等4单位，与日本松下电器产业株式会社、日本松下电子工业株式会社，共同投资6亿元人民币兴建的合资企业，是中日两国间最大的合资企业。
    吸收外资，是国际经济合作的捷径。公司副总经理张仲文说：如果由我们自己投资建这样规模的企业，起码需要5亿元人民币和一笔数量可观的外汇，按常规速度建设，一般需要2至3年；由于承建施工任务的中建一局四公司、安装公司的积极努力，实际上只用了1年零10个月。如果按国内传统观念管理企业，需要招收1800—2300名职工，5年才能收回全部投资；吸收国外管理经验，只需1300名职工，4年内可望收回全部投资。
    毫不夸张地说，这座现代化的厂房和80年代水平的设备，即使在外国也是数得上的企业。进入厂区，建立世界第一流的“CPT”（英文彩色显像管缩写）张贴标语，随处可见。“松下”人的质量意识，以及工作快节奏感，的确把每个人连结在一起了。
    我们来到技术部数据测验室，工作人员按动电钮，屏幕上相继显示出红、绿、蓝的颜色，近乎自然本色。刚投入批量生产的产品达到这样水平，日方也是满意的。在防爆检验室，一个约一磅重的钢球，从1.8米远、1.5米高的倾斜度向玻壳重重击来。随着由势能转为动能、产出二三百公斤重力的钢球，“叭”的一声撞击到玻壳上，撞击处只留下一个白点痕迹。检验结果得5分，高出及格标准2分。
    在这里，无论是技术人员，还是工人，都有着加快我们的彩电国产化的使命感。青年工人赵庆春说，各国执行的质量标准、检验方式，虽说大同小异，但“严”是共同点。关键是从点滴做起。比如，玻壳的28个特性试验参数，需要在90秒内检验完毕。我的岗位责任是：反馈信息要快，不让一个有问题的产品进入市场。不然的话，吃亏的是消费者，厂家信誉受损，自己的“饭碗”会被敲掉。一位曾到日本松下电器公司考察学习归来的青年工人告诉记者，我们的厂房、设备，敢于同“松下”比，但经营管理上差距大。因此，公司领导下气力抓引进消化技术，这条路走对了。青年女工黄涛，这位大学毕业生原被分配到一家设计所工作，后来应聘来这儿。她的感受是：在这儿工作，打破了论资排辈观念，考查每个人成绩的内容包括业务能力，劳动纪律，就业规则等。有本事的就上，没本事的淘汰，竞争起来有公平的机会，——挺叫劲儿的。
    采访时，从公司领导乃至普通工人，对“松下的经营之神”啧啧称道。何谓“经营之神”？这个公司又是怎样把“经营之神”搬进来的呢？张仲文副总经理答道，所谓“经营之神”，用“松下人”的话说：“事业成败在于人”，“制造产品，先‘制造’人”。也就是他们常说的，“让平凡的人干出天才的事业”。
    借鉴学习“松下”的管理经验，结合自己的实际，已开始在公司建立起每月召开恳谈会制。恳谈会的主要议题是围绕发展生产，沟通领导与工人、工人与工人之间的思想交流。由于恳谈会形式的生活气息浓郁，运用自如，目前已成为这个合资企业开展思想教育工作的好形式。
    要求每个人讲职业道德，首先需要尊重人。他说，前不久，新招进公司的10名工人过生日，所在车间为他们举办联欢会。公司总经理、各部部长等前来祝贺，在场人员很受感动。
    借鉴“松下”另一经验是在公司建立朝会制，即利用每天早班布置工作之机，各班、系、科、部，都要强调每个职工严格遵循本公司确立的工业报国、奋发向上和服务奉献精神。
    所有这些，都是为了做人的工作。其实，有些内容就是我们50年代一些企业行之有效的经验。因此，做起来并不难，干部和工人都乐意接受。
    培养人，教育人，关键是提高企业的整体素质，增强每个人的使命感。张仲文说，公司对每个新招来的职工，都采取先培训、后上岗的办法，从而为管理合资企业打下良好的基础。当然，深化企业管理，向管理要效益的潜力还很大。北京市1988年工业系统人均创产值不足3万元，我们公司明年力争人均创销售40万元。
    看来，闯出管理好合资企业的成功之路，确实任重而道远。
