In the recently concluded graduation education, Beijing University students, through studying the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and relevant documents, and watching the "Truth About the Riots" video, have had their thoughts stirred. They believe that "this graduation education is timely and necessary, reflecting the party and government's concern for young students' politics," and "it is the most fruitful learning experience in the four years since enrollment." During the study, many students reflected on their thoughts and actions over the past two months, initially summarizing the lessons they should learn.

- University students must strengthen the study of Marxist theory to resist the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization ideology.
	+ Students believe that the spread of bourgeois liberalization ideology in recent years is the fundamental cause of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot. Because young students have relaxed their study of Marxism, their theoretical foundation is weak, and they cannot distinguish between right and wrong, they were used by conspirators. Some students said that in recent years, due to the passive attitude of Zhao Ziyang, the former General Secretary of the Party, towards opposing bourgeois liberalization, long-term neglect of ideological and political work, and weakening of class struggle awareness, Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought have become "unpopular" among university students, while some Western theories and trends have long permeated the minds of young students. After extensive exposure to Western culture and trends, some people developed an admiration for the capitalist system and doubts about the socialist system, with some even seeking spiritual support in Western democratic systems. Through reflection on the brutal facts of the past two months, students deeply feel the necessity of strengthening the study of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. Some students said that practice has proven that without a foundation in Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot have the ability to distinguish between the various people and events in society and will deviate from the correct direction at critical moments.

- University students must deepen their understanding of China's national conditions and avoid blindly copying foreign models.
	+ Students believe that being detached from reality, not understanding China's national conditions, and blindly copying foreign models are important reasons why many students were drawn into the student movement and turmoil. Some students said that from a young age, they have been detached from reality, from home to school, not understanding China's national conditions, not understanding the thoughts and feelings of 1.1 billion people, and viewing everything as very easy, often following their feelings, resulting in frequent deception. Some students said that due to a lack of understanding of national conditions and long-term detachment from reality, when studying a topic in a room, they often prioritize international over domestic issues, with a lot of background materials, speaking eloquently. But when faced with practical problems, the background is gone, the nature is unclear, and rational analysis is absent, leaving only impulsiveness. Some students said that in the eyes of some people, it seems that everything is better in foreign countries. As a result, some people advocate, and we believe, eager to bring American democracy wholesale to China. Ignoring China's national conditions and not starting from reality, blindly pursuing Western-style democracy, can only lead oneself astray. This painful lesson must not be forgotten.

- University students must correctly view themselves and not regard themselves as "the chosen ones."
	+ Students mentioned that many young students have a deep-seated arrogant and self-righteous "savior" mentality, a sense of superiority, believing themselves to be above others, as the "guides" of the masses, adopting an attitude of "who else but me," which is an important reason why young students cannot extricate themselves from the turmoil. Some students bluntly said that university students' sense of superiority is the "catalyst" for this turmoil, and the "savior" mentality makes it impossible for us to calmly distinguish between right and wrong, even when sometimes feeling guilty, we cannot let go of face, and with some people's malicious flattery, we become even more arrogant. Some students said that we have a tragic immaturity, with more enthusiasm than reason, and bad people take advantage of this. A student painfully said that from the student movement to the riot, there were always a few bad people manipulating, and we became their tools, which is a fact we did not want to admit but now have to admit. Everyone expressed that in the future, we must no longer be "the chosen ones," and must appropriately find our place in society.

- University students must strengthen their legal awareness and not expect to be "special citizens."
	+ Some students said that loving the country means loving the socialist motherland, developing democracy cannot be separated from the guidance of the four cardinal principles, and cannot be separated from the constraints of the constitution and laws. However, this student movement adopted anti-democratic and supra-legal means, resulting in the disruption of normal social order, causing social turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots. Some students, through serious reflection, painfully felt that they urgently need to strengthen their legal awareness and no longer ignore the dignity of the law.

Through study and education, the majority of Beijing University graduates expressed their determination to remember these painful lessons. After taking up their posts, they will further enhance their understanding of the nature, roots, and harm of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, strengthen self-cultivation, and contribute their wisdom and talents to the Four Modernizations. Some students also submitted their applications to join the Party during the study process. Among the more than 2,000 graduates of Beijing University, there are still some students whose thoughts are slow to change, and whose understanding of some issues is not yet clear, and who need to further deepen their study and improve their understanding in the future.

    加强理论学习  深刻认识国情  正确看待自己
    北大毕业生总结经验教训
    决心明辨是非抵制自由化思潮侵蚀
    本报讯　在刚刚结束的毕业教育中，北京大学广大毕业生通过学习邓小平同志重要讲话和有关文件，观看《暴乱真相》录像，思想受到触动，认为“这次毕业教育很及时，很必要，体现了党和政府对青年学生政治上的关怀”，“是入学四年来收获最大的一次学习”。在学习中，相当一部分同学反思了自己两个月来的思想和行为，初步总结了应该记取的教训。
    ——大学生要加强马克思主义理论学习，抵制资产阶级自由化思潮的侵蚀。
    同学们认为，近年来资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥是导致这次动乱和反革命暴乱的根本原因。而青年学生由于放松了马克思主义的学习，理论修养差，分不清大是大非，因而被阴谋分子利用。有的同学说，这些年由于作为党的总书记的赵紫阳同志对反对资产阶级自由化采取消极态度，长期忽视思想政治工作，淡化阶级斗争观念，致使马克思主义、毛泽东思想在大学生中“不吃香”，而西方的一些理论和思潮却长期浸润着青年学生的大脑。在大量地接触了西方文化和思潮后，一些人便产生了对资本主义制度的崇拜，对社会主义制度的怀疑，有的人竟然跑到西方民主制度那里去寻找精神支柱。通过对两个月来残酷事实的反思，同学们深感加强马克思主义、毛泽东思想学习的必要性。有的同学说，实践证明，没有马克思主义、毛泽东思想的根底，就不能有足够的能力来分辨社会上形形色色的人和事，就会在关键时刻偏离正确的方向。
    ——大学生要增进对中国国情的了解，不可照抄照搬外国的模式。
    同学们认为，脱离实际，不了解中国国情，照抄照搬外国的模式，是不少同学卷入学潮、动乱的一个重要原因。有的同学说，我们从小脱离实际，从家门到校门，不了解中国的国情，不了解11亿人民的思想感情，把一切看得十分容易，常常跟着感觉走，结果常常上当受骗。有的同学说，由于不了解国情，长期脱离实际，坐在屋子里研究一个课题时，往往先国际，后国内，背景材料一大堆，讲得头头是道。可一碰到实际问题，背景看不到了，性质认不清了，理智的分析不见了，只有冲动。还有的同学说，在一些人的眼里，似乎什么都是外国的好。结果是有人鼓吹，我们就相信，恨不得把美国的民主一股脑全搬到中国来。而不顾中国国情，不从实际出发，一味追求西方式的民主，只能使自己走上歧路。这个沉痛的教训不可忘记。
    ——大学生要正确地看待自己，不可把自己当作“天之骄子”。
    同学们谈到，不少青年学生的内心深处有着狂妄自大的“救世主意识”，有一种“超人感”，认为自己高人一等，是民众的“引路人”，摆出一副“舍我其谁”的架势，这是青年学生在动乱中不能自拔的一个重要原因。有的同学直截了当地说，大学生的优越感是这次动乱的“催化剂”，“救世主意识”使我们无法冷静下来认真辨别是非真伪，即使有时感到理亏，也丢不下面子，再加上一些人别有用心的吹捧，我们就更飘飘然起来。还有的同学说，我们有可悲的幼稚病，热情有余，理智不足，坏人就利用了这一点。一个同学痛心地说，从学潮直到暴乱的整个过程，始终有少数坏人操纵，我们成为他们利用的工具，这是我们曾不愿意承认、现在不得不承认的事实。大家表示，今后再不能做“天之骄子”了，要恰如其分地找到自己在社会中的地位。
    ——大学生要加强法制观念，不能企望当“特殊公民”。
    有的同学说，爱国就要爱社会主义祖国，发展民主不能离开四项基本原则的指导，不能离开宪法和法律的制约。而这次学潮却采取了反民主和超越法律的手段，其结果必然是破坏正常的社会秩序，造成社会动乱乃至反革命暴乱。有的同学通过认真反思，痛心疾首地感到，自己迫切需要加强法制观念，不能再漠视法律的尊严。
    通过学习和教育，北大广大毕业生表示要牢牢记取这些惨痛的教训，走上工作岗位后，要进一步提高对动乱和反革命暴乱的性质、根源和危害的认识，坚定不移地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，加强自身锻炼，用自己的智慧和才干为四化作贡献。还有的同学在学习过程中向党组织递交了入党申请书。北大2000多名应届毕业生中，也还有一些同学思想弯子转得较慢，对一些问题的认识还不够清楚，有待于今后进一步深入学习、提高认识。　（肖凯）
