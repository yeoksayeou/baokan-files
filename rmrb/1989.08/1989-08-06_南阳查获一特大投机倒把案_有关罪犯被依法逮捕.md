The People's Procuratorate of Nanyang City, Henan Province, recently cracked a major case involving the use of fake invoices, intra-city transfers, and layering to illegally sell metal materials and gain profits of over 1.26 million yuan. The criminals Yang Yufang, Du Xiaoxiao, Zhu Yupei, and Guo Hao have been arrested by law.

Yang Yufang, the former manager of the Nanyang Region Metal Materials Company, colluded with Du Xiaoxiao, the planning department head, and Guo Hao, the manager of the company's affiliated trading center, to defraud the state. On January 5, 1988, Du Xiaoxiao instructed the price clerk to transfer 1193.363 tons of planned steel into the non-planned category. By August of the following year, 1093.965 tons had been sold at a higher price, illegally gaining over 720,000 yuan. On June 14, 1988, Zhu Yupei, the deputy manager of the Henan Province Trading Center, instructed the invoice clerk Chen XX to issue an invoice for 118.7 tons of aluminum wire at a price of 7200 yuan per ton, which was then transferred to the Nanyang Region Metal Materials Company. Subsequently, the invoice clerk of the company's non-ferrous metals department, following Du Xiaoxiao's instructions, issued an invoice at a price of 8530 yuan per ton, which was then transferred to the affiliated trading center. Du Xiaoxiao, through the trading center director Guo Hao, provided blank invoices and issued an invoice at a price of 9500 yuan per ton, transferring it back to the provincial trading center. Through this process, the Nanyang Region Metal Materials Company and its affiliated trading center gained over 270,000 yuan. In late July of the same year, Zhu Yupei and Du Xiaoxiao used the same method of fake invoice transfers to illegally gain 270,000 yuan for the Nanyang Region Metal Materials Company and its affiliated trading center. The case is currently under further investigation.

    有关罪犯被依法逮捕
    本报讯　河南省南阳市人民检察院，最近破获一起采取发票旅行、同城转帐、层层加码的方法，倒卖金属材料非法获利126万多元的案件。罪犯扬予方、杜晓晓、朱玉佩、郭浩被依法逮捕。
    南阳地区金属材料公司原经理扬予方与公司计划科长杜晓晓、公司所属贸易中心经理郭浩相互勾结，坑害国家。1988年1月5日，杜晓晓指使物价员将计划内购进的钢材转入计划外1193.363吨，到去年8月，共加价售出1093.965吨，非法获利72万多元。1988年6月14日，河南省贸易中心副经理朱玉佩指使开票员陈××以指标铝线118.7吨，单价7200元名义，开出发票空转给南阳地区金属材料公司。随后，该公司有色科开票员按照杜晓晓的指使，以单价8530元的价格开票，空转给下属的贸易中心，杜晓晓又通过贸易中心主任郭浩提供的空白发票，以单价9500元开票，空转回省金属公司贸易中心。由此，南阳地区金属材料公司及所属的贸易中心从中获利27万多元。同年7月下旬，朱玉佩、杜晓晓又以完全相同的空转发票手段，为南阳地区金属材料公司及所属贸易中心非法牟利27万元。目前，此案正在进一步审理中。
