	Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today held a press conference in Harare, where he pointed out that it is dangerous for certain Western countries to formulate their policies towards China based on distorted reports and erroneous intelligence.

	Qian Qichen said that during his participation in the international conference on the Cambodian issue in Paris, he met with foreign ministers from major Western countries. Although these countries have recently announced the suspension of high-level exchanges with China, their foreign ministers all proactively requested meetings with him in Paris. These meetings were beneficial for enhancing mutual understanding.

	Qian Qichen said that during these meetings, he pointed out that it is not good to formulate policies towards China based on distorted reports about the situation in China and emotional impulses. It is not surprising that some people abroad are unhappy or have misunderstandings about what has happened in China. However, a government should formulate its policies based on accurate facts.

	Qian Qichen said that out of the 137 countries that have established diplomatic relations with China, only about 20 have responded to the events in China. The majority of countries, including African countries, neighboring Asian countries, Latin American countries, and socialist countries, consider this to be China's internal affair and believe that foreign countries should not interfere.

	Qian Qichen emphasized that China's foreign policy and reform and opening-up policy have not changed. China is willing to establish and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This, of course, depends on the joint efforts of both sides. But one thing is certain: sanctions against China will not be effective.

	In discussing his visit to six countries in southern Africa, Qian Qichen said that the purpose of this visit is: at a time when the situation in southern Africa is showing positive changes, he came to this region to gather firsthand information and to clearly express the support of the Chinese government and people for the just struggle of the people of southern Africa for independence and against apartheid policies.

	In response to a reporter's question about whether China would establish some form of contact with South Africa, Qian Qichen said that China has not had any official contact or communication with the South African authorities. Some South African tourists want to travel to China, some Chinese in South Africa want to return to China to visit relatives, and some South African scientists want to attend an international scientific conference held in Beijing. China cannot refuse these requests.

	Regarding the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue, Qian Qichen said that the meaning of a comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue is that foreign troops should completely withdraw from Cambodia, and the consequences caused by the invasion of foreign troops should also be eliminated. In other words, internal war should be prevented after the withdrawal of foreign troops, and national reconciliation should be implemented under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk to form a four-party joint government. This is the position of the majority of countries participating in the Paris International Conference and also the position of China. He said that China hopes that Cambodia can become an independent, neutral, and non-aligned country.

    钱外长在哈拉雷批评某些西方国家
    根据歪曲报道制订对华政策是危险的
    本报哈拉雷8月4日电  新华社记者张敬雷、本报记者李景卫报道：中国外交部长钱其琛今天在这里举行的记者招待会上指出，某些西方国家根据歪曲报道和错误情报来制订对华政策是危险的。
    钱其琛说，他在巴黎参加关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议时，会见了主要西方国家的外长。虽然这些国家最近相继宣布中断同中国的高级别的往来，但它们的外长在巴黎都主动要求举行会见。这些会见对增进了解是有益的。
    钱其琛说，他在这些会见时指出，根据对中国事态的一些歪曲的报道和凭感情冲动来制订对华政策是不好的。国外有人对中国发生的事情不高兴或者有误解，这并不奇怪。但是作为一个政府应该根据准确的事实来制订政策。
    钱其琛说，在与中国建交的137个国家中，只有大约20个国家对中国发生的事件作出了反应。多数国家，包括非洲国家、亚洲的邻国、拉丁美洲国家、社会主义国家都认为这是中国的内政，外国不应干涉。
    钱其琛强调，中国的外交政策和改革开放政策没有改变。中国愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同世界上各个国家建立和发展友好合作关系。这当然取决于双方共同的努力。但有一条可以肯定，对中国实行制裁是不可能奏效的。
    在谈到他这次南部非洲6国之行时，钱其琛说，此行的目的是：在当前南部非洲局势出现积极的变化时，他来这个地区了解第一手材料，同时明确表示中国政府和人民对南部非洲人民争取独立、反对种族隔离政策正义斗争的支持。
    在回答记者提出的中国是否会同南非建立某种接触时，钱其琛说，中国同南非当局没有进行过任何官方的接触或联系。有些南非的旅游者要到中国去旅游，在南非的一些华人要回中国探亲，一些南非科学家要出席在北京举行的国际科学讨论会，中国不能拒绝。
    关于全面解决柬埔寨问题，钱其琛说，柬埔寨问题全面解决的含义就是外国军队从柬埔寨全部撤出，同时，由于外国军队入侵造成的后果也应该消除。也就是说要防止在外国军队撤出后发生内战，应当实行民族和解，在西哈努克亲王领导下成立四方联合政府。这是参加巴黎国际会议多数国家的立场，也是中国的立场。他说，中国希望柬埔寨能成为一个独立、中立、不结盟的国家。
