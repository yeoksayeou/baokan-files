Is It the Township Government or a Gambling Den?

Last winter, a few township officials in our township secretly engaged in gambling. Since March of this year, some of the main officials in our township have also joined in, leading to a surge in gambling activities. Gambling dens have even been set up in the offices of some key officials.

On June 7, a township official told us: "A few days ago, I was dragged into it, gambling from 9 PM until 10 AM the next day, losing 63 yuan. On May 24, a middle school student came to get a signature for his college entrance exam form and was wandering around the courtyard, while the main township official was still playing mahjong and couldn't attend to his duties." Some farmers who frequently come to the township government office to fetch water said: "Lately, almost every morning, we can hear the sound of mahjong from the upstairs office."

    是乡政府，还是赌场
    去年冬天，我乡少数乡干部搞赌博偷偷摸摸。今年3月以来，我乡一些主要干部也加入了这一行列，致使赌风日趋猖炽，赌场居然设在一些主要干部的办公室内。
    6月7日，一位乡干部对我们说：“前几天，我被拉进去，从晚上9点赌到第二天上午10点，输了63元。5月24日，一个中学生找乡主要干部签盖考生表在大院内转来转去，而乡主要干部仍在玩麻将，顾不上办公。”一些常到乡政府大院内担水的农民说：“最近差不多天天早上都能听到楼上传来的麻将声。”
