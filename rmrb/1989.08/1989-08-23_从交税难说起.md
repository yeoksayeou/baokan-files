    It was reported that a young writer from the Kunming Military Region's Creative Studio earned several thousand yuan in royalties from a book and voluntarily paid the individual income adjustment tax. However, from the local tax bureau to the municipal and district tax bureaus, no one knew who should collect the tax or how to collect it. After a year of delay, the tax was "approved" to be temporarily collected at a 20% rate, and the writer was told, "Let's collect it this way for now, and we'll adjust the rate later if necessary."

    Similarly, last year, a foreign employee of a joint venture in a certain county went to the local tax authority to pay personal income tax, but the responsible officer dared not handle it and did not know whether to collect it or not.

    Previously, the tax authorities only emphasized the difficulty of collecting taxes, but they did not realize that taxpayers also face difficulties in paying taxes, and this is not an isolated phenomenon. This cannot but make us reflect deeply.

    Taking the individual income adjustment tax as an example, it has been levied since January 1, 1987. The State Council's "Provisional Regulations on the Individual Income Adjustment Tax of the People's Republic of China" clearly stipulates the taxable objects, the taxable income base, and the tax standards for different wage categories and different sources of income. The collection of personal income tax began even earlier. The "Individual Income Tax Law" promulgated and implemented in 1980 stipulates that foreigners in China must pay personal income tax. Several years have passed, but some tax authorities and their staff are still unaware of this, indicating that some tax officials lack professional knowledge and have low qualifications. It seems that while it is important to strengthen tax collection and management, plug income loopholes, educate citizens to develop the habit of paying taxes, and stop tax evasion, this is only one aspect. On the other hand, how tax authorities adapt to the situation and improve their work is also not to be neglected.

    In recent years, with the deepening of the reform and the development of the commodity economy, in order to strengthen macro-control, we have introduced some new taxes to play the role of the tax lever in the economy. However, some departments' leaders and business personnel lack sufficient understanding of this, and some even emphasize that their income is not much and the trouble is too much, fearing to "pick up sesame seeds and lose the watermelon." In fact, if the scattered taxes are well managed, they can also accumulate into a significant amount. Moreover, taxing personal income and earnings is intended to adjust the income gap among members of society, alleviate the contradictions of unfair distribution, and is related to maintaining social stability and overall stability.

    Another point to note is that in the past decade, about 200,000 new people have joined the tax team. Some of them started working without training, lack professional knowledge, and have poor abilities. Over the years, the leading organs of the tax departments have done a lot of work to improve the professional qualifications of tax officials. In the future, while expanding the tax team, we should pay more attention to improving the quality of the team, raising political awareness, strengthening business training, and making tax officials both able to uphold principles and act impartially, and familiar with business to do a good job. As the awareness of paying taxes among the people increases, more and more people will voluntarily pay taxes. Therefore, it is all the more important for tax departments to improve their work and efficiency and provide more convenience for taxpayers.

    从交税难说起
    钊拓
    报载，昆明部队创作室一青年作家著书得稿酬数千元，主动交纳个人收入调节税，然而，从所在地税务所到市、区税务局，竟都不知该由谁收、怎么收。拖了一年，才“经请示”按20％的税率暂收，还告诉这位作家，“先这么收了，以后明确税率再多退少补。”
    无独有偶。去年，某县一合资企业外方人员到当地税务机关交纳个人所得税，专管员居然不敢接办，更不知该收不该收。
    以前税务部门只是强调收税难，殊不知也有纳税人交税难的，而且不是个别现象，这不能不引起我们深思。
    就拿个人收入调节税来说，早于1987年1月1日就开征了；国务院发布的《中华人民共和国个人收入调节税暂行条例》，对纳税对象、各工资类别区各种收入来源不同的计税基数、纳税标准，均有明确规定。个人所得税征收时间则更早。1980年颁布实施的《个人所得税法》已规定在华外国人须交纳个人所得税。好几年过去了，有些税务机关及其工作人员，居然对此一无所知，说明一些税务部门的公务人员业务不熟，素质比较低。看来，要加强税收征管、堵塞收入漏洞，教育公民养成纳税习惯，制止偷税漏税行为固然重要，但这只是一个重要方面；另一方面税务机关如何适应形势，改进工作，也是不容忽视的。
    这几年，随着改革深入和商品经济发展，为了加强宏观调控，我们新设一些税种，以发挥税收的经济杠杆作用。但有些部门的领导和业务人员，对此缺乏足够认识，有的甚至片面强调其收入不多，麻烦不少，怕“拣了芝麻丢了西瓜”。其实，零散税收抓好管住，也能集腋成裘。更何况，对个人所得和收入征税，目的是为了调节社会成员之间收入悬殊，缓解分配不公的矛盾，关系到维护社会安定，稳定大局。
    还有一点须指出，近十年来，大约有20多万新人充实到税务队伍中来。其中有些未经培训就上岗，缺乏业务知识，能力较差。几年来，税务部门的领导机关为提高税务干部的业务素质做了许多工作。今后，在壮大税务队伍的同时，还应更加重视提高队伍的素质，提高思想政治觉悟，加强业务训练，使税务干部既能坚持原则、秉公办事，又能熟悉业务，做好工作。随着全民纳税意识的增强，主动、自觉纳税的人会越来越多，税务部门改进工作，提高效率，为纳税人提供更多方便，就越发显得重要了。
