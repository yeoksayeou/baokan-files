**What Does the U.S. Intend by Its Large-Scale Military Exercises?**

The U.S. military forces stationed in Panama conducted the largest military exercise in recent years on August 17 in the Panama Canal Zone. The U.S. Southern Command, headquartered in the Canal Zone, deployed 12,000 troops from the army, navy, and air force across 9 military bases along the canal from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The Panamanians have not threatened the canal or the safety of Americans, so why is the U.S. conducting such large-scale military exercises?

Firstly, it is to exert pressure on the ongoing three-party talks aimed at resolving the political crisis in Panama, thereby strengthening the position of the opposition party, which the U.S. supports, in the negotiations. After the May 7 election was nullified, the political crisis in Panama intensified, and the scheduled power transfer on September 1 encountered difficulties. The ruling party advocates for the establishment of a temporary national unity government, while the opposition party demands recognition of its victory in the election. With the mediation of the Organization of American States, the stalemate was broken, and the government, the ruling party, and the opposition party, including the military, began "three-party dialogue" on July 16 to seek a solution to the crisis. Although several rounds of dialogue have been held, due to the differing views of the ruling party and the opposition party, no substantial progress has been made so far. The U.S. intends to use military pressure to force the Panamanian government to make concessions to the opposition party in future power arrangements.

Additionally, some observers believe that the U.S.'s frequent military exercises may have the intention of actual combat. Recently, the U.S. government has repeatedly threatened to use all means, including force, to overthrow the rule of the strongman Noriega. American leaders have even threatened to "capture" Noriega and bring him to the U.S. for trial. The Panamanian government has stated that the U.S.'s consecutive military exercises are "provocations" against Panama and a prelude to a "military invasion."

The U.S.'s actions in Panama have sparked resolute resistance from the Panamanian people. Since July, various sectors in Panama have held continuous protests and demonstrations. Most Latin American countries also support Panama's just struggle to defend its national sovereignty. As the world is about to enter the 1990s, the U.S.'s bullying and pursuit of hegemony are clearly out of step with the times.

### 美国大举演兵意欲何为

    美国大举演兵意欲何为
    新华社记者　刘瑞常
    美国驻巴拿马武装部队17日在巴拿马运河区举行了近年来规模最大的一次军事演习，总部设在运河区的美国南方司令部1.2万名陆、海、空三军各兵种在从太平洋到大西洋运河沿岸14个军事基地中的9个基地上进行了演习。巴拿马人未曾危及运河与美国人的安全，美国为何要大举演兵？
    首先是为了向巴拿马目前正在进行的为寻求解决政治危机而举行的3方谈判施加压力，以加强它支持的反对党在谈判中的地位。5月7日大选作废后，巴拿马政治危机加剧，预定9月1日进行的政权更迭出现困难。执政党主张成立临时全国团结政府，反对党则要求承认它在大选中获胜。在美洲国家组织的斡旋下，僵局被打破，包括国防军在内的政府、执政党和反对党于7月16日开始进行“3方对话”，以寻求解决危机的办法。对话虽已进行过几次，但因执政党与反对党各执己见，到目前为止，尚未取得实质性进展。美国企图用施加军事压力的手段来迫使巴拿马政府在未来的政权组织方面向反对党作出让步。
    此外，一些观察家认为，美国如此频繁的军事演习很可能有实战的目的。最近，美国政府多次扬言，为推翻实权人物诺列加的统治，美国对巴拿马不排除包括使用武力在内的各种手段。日前，美国领导人甚至扬言要“抓获”诺列加到美国受审。巴拿马政府表示，美国接二连三的军事演习是对巴拿马的“挑衅”，也是美国准备对巴进行“军事入侵的先兆”。
    美国在巴拿马的所作所为，引起巴拿马人民的坚决反抗。自7月份以来，巴各界人士连续举行抗议示威，拉美多数国家也支持巴捍卫国家主权的正义斗争。在世界即将进入90年代的时候，美国如此恃强凌弱，推行强权政治，显然是不合时宜的。
