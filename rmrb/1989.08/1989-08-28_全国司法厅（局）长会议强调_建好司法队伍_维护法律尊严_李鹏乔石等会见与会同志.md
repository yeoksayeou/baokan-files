In the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the broad masses of judicial administrative cadres and police have remained loyal to the Party and the people, and have withstood the test of the storm. From August 23 to 27, the national conference of directors of judicial bureaus was held in Beijing, which fully affirmed this point. Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Wang Fang, Ren Jianxin, and others met with all the participants of the conference on August 26.

Minister of Justice Cai Cheng pointed out: In the coming period, work should focus on the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session, with one hand strengthening ideological and political work and the construction of the judicial administrative cadre team; and with the other hand, playing the role of the judicial administrative department, seriously doing a good job in various business work, and serving the Party and the state's central work. It must be recognized that the judicial administrative organs uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and have special and important significance; at the same time, those engaged in legal work must always uphold the interests of the proletariat and the people, uphold the dignity of socialist law, and resolutely fight against all actions that violate socialist law and the Constitution of our country. This requires a correct understanding of the reality of class struggle, strengthening the concept of enemy and the consciousness of people's democratic dictatorship. It is necessary to strictly govern the Party and strictly govern the police, and strive to build a team of judicial administrative cadres who are loyal to the Party and the people, proficient in business, have a strong style, strict discipline, honest and upright, and have fighting spirit.

Cai Cheng also pointed out that in recent years, judicial administrative work has undergone some reforms. The line of reform and opening up must be continued, but it must adhere to the socialist direction, strive to improve work quality, and provide excellent legal services and legal guarantees for rectification and deepening of reform.

    建好司法队伍  维护法律尊严
    李鹏乔石等会见与会同志
    本报北京8月28日讯　记者晓渡报道：在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，广大司法行政干警，忠于党、忠于人民，经受住了风浪的考验。8月23日至27日在北京召开的全国司法厅（局）长会议，充分肯定了这一点。李鹏、乔石、王芳、任建新等于8月26日接见了全体参加会议的同志。
    司法部部长蔡诚指出：今后一段时期的工作，要围绕四中全会提出的四件大事，一手抓思想政治工作和司法行政干警的队伍建设；一手抓发挥司法行政部门的职能作用，认真搞好各项业务工作，为党和国家的中心工作服务。要认识到，司法行政机关坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，具有特殊重要的意义；同时，从事法律工作的同志必须处处维护无产阶级及人民大众的利益，维护社会主义法律的尊严，同一切破坏社会主义法律、违反我国宪法的行为进行坚决的斗争。这就必须正确认识阶级斗争存在的现实，增强敌情观念和人民民主专政意识。必须从严治党，从严治警，努力建设一支忠于党和人民，精通业务，作风过硬，纪律严明，廉洁奉公，有战斗力的司法行政干警队伍。
    蔡诚还指出，几年来，司法行政工作进行了一些改革，改革开放的路线必须继续坚持，但必须坚持社会主义的方向，努力提高工作质量，为治理整顿和深化改革提供优良的法律服务和法律保障。
