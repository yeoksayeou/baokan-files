Jilin Province's Jiuxi County has reformed its cadre evaluation system by integrating the principle of integrity into its internal contract system, work target management, and open office procedures. The system determines the retention and promotion of cadres based on their integrity.

The county has stipulated that integrity is a significant factor in the evaluation of cadres. Those who do not meet the requirements will not be appointed. During their term, if a cadre performs poorly or engages in corrupt behavior, they can be dismissed at any time. After being dismissed, the cadre will undergo a study period of 1 to 3 months at their original unit, receiving only basic salary. Those who pass the examination after the study period can find a new appointment within their department; those who fail will extend their study period by 3 to 6 months, receiving 80% of the basic salary. After the extended study period, those who pass the examination will be assigned as probationary clerks. The probation period is 3 to 6 months, with only basic salary provided. Those who perform well during the probation period can be appointed as clerks upon completion, while those who perform poorly will be assigned to labor-intensive work and will not receive cadre benefits. They can also find a new unit to accept them, and the transfer procedures will be handled as for cadres.

Relevant personnel believe that this personnel system effectively addresses the issue of cadres, regardless of their integrity, all receiving the same treatment and holding the same positions. It shifts from treating integrity and lack of integrity the same way to making integrity and lack of integrity different, becoming an incentive mechanism for party and government cadres to be honest and upright. Currently, in the 16 departments of this county that are piloting the reform, 40 mid-level cadres have been dismissed, accounting for 17% of the total number of mid-level cadres in these departments; 21 general cadres have been dismissed, accounting for 3% of the total number of general cadres; and 17 honest and upright, young and energetic general cadres have been appointed as mid-level cadres.

Relevant parties believe that integrating personnel management, governance, and supervision in this way can subject all party and government cadres to supervision without exception. Moreover, because this supervision is institutionalized, it is more scientific, regular, and participatory.

    吉林蛟河县改革干部考核制度
    不廉洁就别当党的干部
    用人治事监督有机结合　形成廉洁奉公激励机制
    新华社长春8月3日电　（通讯员傅向东、钱曙林）吉林省蛟河县县直机关进行干部制度改革时，把干部廉洁贯彻于内部聘任制、工作目标管理和公开办事制度之中，并以廉洁与否决定干部的去留、升降。
    这个县在考核干部中明确规定，廉洁条件占相当比重，达不到要求者不予聘任。干部在受聘期间，表现不好，有腐败行为的可随时解聘。干部落聘后，由原单位组织学习，学期1至3个月，只发基本工资。学习期满经考试合格者，可在本部门自找聘任单位；不合格者延长学期3至6个月，发给80％基本工资。延期学习后经考试合格者，分配做见习科员。见习期3至6个月，只发基本工资。见习期间表现好的，期满可聘为科员，表现不好的分配做劳务性工作，不享受干部待遇。本人也可自找接收单位，按干部办理调动手续。
    有关人士认为，这种人事干部制度，较好地解决了干部当中不论廉洁与否同吃“大锅饭”、同坐“铁交椅”的问题，从原来的廉洁与不廉洁“一个样”，变成了廉洁与不廉洁“不一样”，成为各级党政干部廉洁奉公的激励机制。据了解，目前这个县先行试点的16个部门中，已有40名中层干部落聘，占这些部门中层干部总数的17％；21名一般干部落聘，占一般干部总数的3％；有17名廉洁奉公、年富力强的一般干部被聘为中层干部。
    有关方面认为，像这样把用人、治事、监督有机地结合起来，能使所有的党政干部，无一例外地受到监督，同时，由于这种监督形成了制度，就更带有科学性、经常性和群众性。
