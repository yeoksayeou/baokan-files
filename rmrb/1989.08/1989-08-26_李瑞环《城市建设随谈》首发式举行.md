Tianjin, August 26th - The launch ceremony for Li Ruihuan's book "Random Thoughts on Urban Construction" was held today in Tianjin. The author has been working in Tianjin for exactly one hundred months. Over the past eight years, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government, along with the city's eight million residents, have worked tirelessly to transform the old city of Tianjin, which was severely damaged by the Cultural Revolution and an earthquake, into a completely renewed new Tianjin. This 480,000-character book, compiled from a large number of excerpts, is both a collection of random thoughts on various topics, times, and scenes, and a systematic work on urban science with Chinese characteristics.

    李瑞环《城市建设随谈》首发式举行
    本报天津八月二十六日电  记者肖荻报道：天津市今天为李瑞环同志著的《城市建设随谈》一书举行了首发式。
    作者在津工作刚好一百个月。八年多来，天津市委、市政府率八百万市民艰苦奋斗，将遭受“文革”及地震双重破坏的老津城，变成焕然一新的新天津。从大量文摘中选编的这本四十八万字的《城市建设随谈》，既是随事、随时、随景、随意而谈，又是一部具有中国特色的系统的城市科学著作。
