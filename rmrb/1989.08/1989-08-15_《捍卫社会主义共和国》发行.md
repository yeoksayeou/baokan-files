A large-scale documentary and photographic book titled "Defending the Socialist Republic," which details the efforts of the capital's military and civilians to quell the turmoil and suppress the riot, was published and released today.

This 440,000-character book was edited by the General Political Department's Propaganda Department of the People's Liberation Army and the PLA Daily, and published by the Long March Press. It provides a rich and detailed account, through text and photographs, of the entire process of the capital's military and civilians stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot during the spring and summer. It reveals the international background and domestic social foundation of this struggle, exposes the evil deeds of a small number of people who conspired to overthrow the Communist Party and the socialist republic, and praises the heroic deeds of the capital's martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot. It also highlights the deep bond of love and unity between the military and the people in the capital. The book also includes excerpts from Deng Xiaoping's remarks on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, as well as important documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
