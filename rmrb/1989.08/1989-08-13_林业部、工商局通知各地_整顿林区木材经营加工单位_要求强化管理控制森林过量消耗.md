The Ministry of Forestry and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently issued a notice on strengthening the supervision and management of timber operations and processing units in forest areas. The notice requires local authorities to strengthen the protection and management of forest resources, effectively control the excessive consumption of forests, and rectify the chaotic situation in the timber circulation sector.

The notice states that local forestry authorities and industrial and commercial administrative departments should thoroughly clean up and rectify existing timber operation and processing units in forest areas and key timber-producing counties. This work should be combined with the cleanup and rectification of companies, annual inspections, re-registration, and license renewal. Timber operation and processing units that have already been registered must undergo an audit by the county-level or higher forestry authorities in their respective locations by the end of this year. After approval, the original industrial and commercial administrative departments should handle the annual inspection and license renewal procedures. Those that meet the conditions for re-registration should complete the re-registration process. Units that have already undergone annual inspections and license renewals, and whose operations and processing do not require changes in the scope of business registration, should be filed by the original industrial and commercial administrative departments. Units that have not been approved by the forestry authorities should apply to the original industrial and commercial administrative departments for changes in registration or cancellation of registration. Those that continue to operate without completing the above procedures will be dealt with as exceeding the scope of business.

The notice further states that forestry authorities should review timber operation and processing units based on the following conditions: (1) They must have sufficient working capital corresponding to the amount of timber they operate, with at least 50% of the total being their own funds; (2) They must have a fixed place of business; (3) They must have personnel corresponding to their production and operation scale; (4) Their scope of business must comply with national and provincial laws, regulations, and policies; (5) They must be conducive to the protection of forest resources. Based on the local forest resource situation and the annual timber harvesting quota or the "one-account" system for timber production, the number and scale of timber operation and processing units should be reasonably determined. For units operating timber within the county, stricter controls should be enforced. Especially in key timber-producing counties, the forestry department must manage and purchase timber from the mountains in a unified manner. Other departments must not enter the mountains to purchase timber directly without the approval of the forestry authorities at or above the municipal level. Individuals are not allowed to resell or transport timber.

    林业部、工商局通知各地
    整顿林区木材经营加工单位
    要求强化管理控制森林过量消耗
    新华社北京8月13日电  林业部、国家工商行政管理局日前发出关于加强林区木材经营、加工单位监督管理的通知，要求各地强化森林资源保护管理，有效控制森林过量消耗，整治木材流通领域中的混乱现象。
    通知说，各级林业主管部门和工商行政管理机关对林区和重点产材县现有的木材经营单位和以木材为原料的生产加工企业，要认真进行清理整顿。这项工作可与公司清理整顿、年检、重新登记注册和换照结合进行。已登记的木材经营、加工单位，在今年年底前，须经所在地的县级或县级以上林业主管部门审查，经审核同意后，由原登记的工商行政管理机关办理年检、换照手续，其中具备重新登记注册条件的公司，应办理重新登记注册。已办理过年检、换照手续，其经营、加工不引起经营范围变更登记的，由原登记的工商行政管理机关备案。未经林业主管部门审核同意的，应向原登记的工商行政管理机关申请变更登记或注销登记；如不履行上述手续继续经营的，按超越经营范围处理。新设立的木材经营、加工单位，按上述规定办理审查、登记手续。
    通知说，林业主管部门对木材经营、加工单位进行审查时，按以下条件掌握：（一）具有与其经营木材数量相适应的流动资金，其中自有资金应占总额的50％以上；（二）有固定的经营场所；（三）有与其生产经营规模相适应的从业人员；（四）经营范围必须符合国家和省、自治区有关法律、法规和政策的规定；（五）有利于保护林木资源，根据当地森林资源状况和年森林采伐限额或木材生产“一本帐”的规定，合理确定木材经营、加工单位的数量及其经营（加工）的规模。对经营本县木材的，更要从严控制。特别对重点产材县，必须坚持由林业部门统一管理和进山收购。其他部门未经地、市以上林业主管部门批准，不得进山直接收购木材。不允许个人倒卖和贩运木材。
