The forest resource crisis in our country has reached a very severe stage. According to the data from the recently concluded third national forest resource survey, although the area of afforestation has increased slightly in recent years, due to the sharp increase in social demand, the annual consumption of timber has increased from 1.96 billion cubic meters in the first survey (1973-1976) and 2.94 billion cubic meters in the second survey (1977-1981) to 3.44 billion cubic meters in the third survey (1984-1988). The consumption deficit has reached 97 million cubic meters. If the current consumption level is maintained, the available mature and over-mature forests can only last for seven or eight years. However, the near-mature forests that are supposed to replenish the resources are of poor quality and insufficient quantity, leading to a potential "gap" in timber production. If timely and decisive measures are not taken, the shrinking of forest resources will be irreversible, and the deteriorating terrestrial ecological system will further worsen, leading to more severe natural disasters nationwide.

Recently, at the China Forestry Development Strategy Youth Symposium held by the Beijing Forestry Society, some young forestry technologists addressed the forest resource crisis and made several reform suggestions to relevant authorities.

	Reject the traditional forestry model centered on timber production and reconstruct a modern forestry development model under the guidance of ecological economics. Zhou Yanfei from the Comprehensive Planning Department of the State Forestry Administration and Ma Aiguo from the Survey and Planning Design Institute believe that there are deviations in China's forestry guidance. Forestry economic management has long been biased towards timber production and neglecting afforestation. In planning management, the organic link between resource cultivation and timber harvesting is artificially severed, and the focus of planning is placed on simple timber extraction, resulting in a serious imbalance between extraction and cultivation. In statistics and financial accounting, a system of accounting, supervision, and assessment centered on timber production and profit indicators is implemented, making timber production a hard target and afforestation a soft task. Over-harvesting beyond resource carrying capacity is very serious. In investment structure, a tilted investment policy centered on timber production is implemented. Over the past 40 years, forestry basic construction investment aimed at resource extraction has accounted for two-thirds of the total investment, and afforestation work has no status, forming a depletion-type economic structure. To reverse the current chaotic economic management situation, the first step is to shift the forestry guidance to an ecological economic foundation, and based on the laws of forest growth and forestry economics, establish a forestry development model that suits the national and forestry conditions.

	Reform the current economic management system of state-owned forest areas and clarify the rights, responsibilities, and interests of forest management. According to Chen Ze from the Policy Research Office of the State Forestry Administration and Liao Yunfeng from Beijing Forestry University, the management system of state-owned forest areas, which account for 45.3% of China's forested land, is seriously outdated. The 131 state-owned forestry enterprises nationwide are managed by local governments in terms of personnel and taxes, while the central government is responsible for planning, investment, and timber extraction. There are multiple leaders, and the ownership of forest resources is unclear. The grassroots forestry bureaus have multiple functions such as production, operation, administration, and management, and the resource management system lacks necessary constraints. As a result, a situation has arisen where "the state wants timber, the local government wants profits, the enterprise wants to survive, and the workers want to eat." Everyone thinks they have the right to benefits, but no one cares about the growth and decline of resources. Especially after implementing the policy of unified collection and distribution for local governments, various places continue to increase the tax and profit indicators for forestry enterprises to increase local financial resources, resulting in a lack of investment in forest cultivation and a sharp increase in timber consumption, making it difficult to maintain the minimum level of reproduction. They believe that the urgent task is to promote the reform of the management system of state-owned forest areas, quickly solve the problems of the virtualization of ownership of state-owned forest resources, the lack of management, and the multiple interests, establish a constraint mechanism between management, operation, and timber extraction, and control the abnormal consumption of forests through economic and legal means to restore the vitality of enterprises.

	Properly handle the contradiction between timber supply and demand, and coordinate the relationship between importing timber and enhancing the vitality of timber production. Feng Guoqing from the Forestry Economics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, and Ning Yulin and Chen Jiancheng from Beijing Forestry University believe that some people think that importing timber can meet part of the domestic timber demand and is beneficial for forest regeneration. From a static perspective, this view seems reasonable, but from the actual situation of timber production in the country, it is a short-sighted behavior of "cutting flesh to cover wounds." They believe that forests are renewable resources. As long as simple labor is invested, they can be produced. Now, the country uses foreign exchange five to six times higher than the national afforestation operation to import timber, which, in a sense, is importing a large amount of simple labor. However, domestic simple labor is seriously in excess, and 44.3% of forestry land is not developed due to lack of funds. In the long run, this is not beneficial to the country or the people. Moreover, the import of timber has impacted the domestic timber market, leading to a decrease in timber prices and even causing timber accumulation, harming the interests of timber producers and inhibiting the development of domestic forestry. China has already become the second-largest timber importer in the world. It is not realistic to immediately stop imports, but it is necessary to limit the quantity. They propose that the country should save a little on timber use, tighten its belt for a few years, and allocate some funds to support the nearly collapsed domestic forestry. They suggest that the forestry department participate in the management of imported timber and, based on the domestic and international timber market situation, coordinate the increasingly severe supply and demand contradictions.

	Adjust and strengthen the support policies for fast-growing and high-yielding forest construction and forestry industry to prepare for the timber resource "gap" crisis. Jiang Xishan from the Afforestation Management Department of the State Forestry Administration believes that although the state has recently launched forestry project loans and actively supported the construction of high-yielding forests, the State Forestry Administration has also made plans based on future needs and plans to build a 100 million mu fast-growing and high-yielding forest base by the year 2000. However, the policy of issuing forestry project loans in various places lacks continuity, and the loan period is shorter than the production cycle of most tree species, which is not conducive to timber production. In addition, due to the difficulty in implementing the loan plan and the many links in loan issuance, the construction plan often fails, and afforestation work is facing many difficulties. He suggests that based on the characteristics of timber production and the requirements of project construction, the forestry loan method should be adjusted, the interest settlement method should be reformed, and the management function of the forestry management department should be fully played to ensure the continuity of the policy, so that the construction of high-yielding forest bases can achieve the expected effect. Shi Feng from the Planning Department of the State Forestry Administration believes that the structural gap in China's forest resources is inevitable. The role of new forestry products in compensating for resource structure changes and easing social demand cannot be underestimated. He suggests strengthening the scientific research work of forestry products, determining the medium-term development goals of the forestry industry, and formulating corresponding supporting policies to promote the rapid development of the artificial board industry, which has long been neglected and is still relatively backward.

    如何解决森林资源危机
    ——一些青年林业科技工作者的建议
    本报记者　谢联辉
    我国森林资源危机已经发展到十分严峻的程度。据刚结束不久的全国第三次清查所得资料，虽然近几年大力植树造林面积略有增加，但因社会需求量猛增，木材资源年消耗量从第一次清查（1973—1976年）的1.96亿立方米、第二次清查（1977—1981年）的2.94亿立方米，增加到第三次清查（1984—1988年）的3.44亿立方米，消耗量赤字已达9700万立方米。若按目前消耗水平推算，可采伐的成熟林和过熟林只能维持七八年，而近熟林接续资源又质差量少，木材生产面临“断档”，如不抓紧时机采取果断措施，森林资源萎缩局面无法挽回，正在衰退的陆地生态主体将进一步恶化，全国将要遭受更残酷的自然灾害惩罚。
    不久前，在北京林学会举办的中国林业发展战略青年研讨会上，一些青年林业科技工作者针对森林资源危机，向有关方面呼吁，并提出若干改革建议。
    摒弃以木材生产为中心的传统林业，在生态经济理论指导下重新构造现代林业发展模式。林业部综合计划司周亚非、调查规划设计院马爱国认为，我国林业指导思想有偏差，林业经济管理长期处于重森工生产、轻营林生产的倾斜状态。在计划管理上，人为地割断资源培育和采伐利用的有机联系，把计划工作重心放在单纯取材上，造成取育比例严重失调；在统计和财务核算上，实行以木材生产为主体、利润指标为核心的核算、监督、考核体系，致使木材生产成为硬指标，营林生产成为软任务，超资源承受力的盲目采伐十分严重，在投资结构上，实行以木材生产为中心的倾斜投资政策，40年来以索取资源为目的的森工基本建设投资占总投资的2／3，营林工作没有地位，形成一种耗竭型经济结构。要扭转目前经济管理无序状况，首先要把林业指导思想转移到生态经济基础上，根据森林生长规律和林业经济规律，建立符合国情、林情的林业发展模式。
    改变国有林区现行经济管理体制，明确经营森林的责权利。据林业部政研室陈泽、北京林业大学廖运凤分析，占我国有林地面积45.3％的国有林区，管理体制严重不适应。全国131个国有森工企业，地方政府管人事、收税利，中央政府管计划、给投资、要木材，多头领导，“婆婆多”，森林资源归属不清；基层林业局又集生产、经营、行政、管理等多种职能于一身，资源管理体制缺乏必要的约束机制。结果形成“国家要木材，地方要利润，企业要生存，职工要吃饭”的局面，大家都认为自己有收益权，而谁也不关心资源消长，特别是对地方实行统收统支政策后，各地不断增加林业企业税利指标以增加地方财力，致使培育森林缺乏投入，林木消耗剧增，难以维持最低水平的再生产。他们认为，当务之急是抓好国有林区的经营体制改革，尽快解决国有森林资源产权虚置、经营无主、多方争利的问题，建立管理、经营和采伐利用间的制约机制，通过经济和法律手段控制森林非正常消耗，恢复企业活力。
    正确处理木材供需矛盾，协同解决进口木材与增强林木生产活力的关系。林科院林经所奉国强、北京林业大学宁玉林和陈建成说，有些人以为进口木材能满足国内部分木材需求，有利于森林休养生息。从静态角度孤立地看待木材需求问题，似乎有理，但从全国林木生产实际情况来看，则是一种
  “割肉补疮”的短视行为。他们认为，森林是可再生资源，只要投入简单劳动力就能够生产，现在国家用高出全国营林经营五六倍的外汇进口木材，从某种意义上说是进口了大量简单劳动力，而国内简单劳动力严重过剩，44.3％林业用地因缺乏资金得不到开发利用，从长远看于国于民不利。另外，进口木材冲击了国内木材市场，导致木材价格下降，甚至造成木材集压，伤害木材生产者利益，抑制了国内林业发展。我国已经是世界上木材进口第二大国，要立即杜绝进口是不现实的，但有必要在数量上加以限制。他们主张，全国在木材使用上节约点，过几年紧日子，腾出一点资金扶持近乎衰败的国内林业。建议林业部门参加进口木材管理，根据国内外木材市场情况，协同处理日益加剧的供需矛盾。
    调整和强化速生丰产林建设和林工产业的扶持政策，为渡过木材资源“断档”难关作准备。林业部造林经营司姜喜山认为，虽然近些年国家开办林业项目贷款，积极支持营造丰产林，林业部根据未来的需要也作出规划，准备到2000年建设1亿亩速生丰产林基地，但各地发放林业项目贷款政策缺乏连续性，贷款期限比大多数树种生产周期短，不利于林木生产。再加上贷款计划难于落实、贷款发放环节过多等原因，建设计划往往落空，营林工作困难重重。他建议根据林木生产特点和项目建设要求，调整林业贷款办法，改革利息结算方式，充分发挥林业主管部门管理职能作用，保障政策的连续性，以使丰产林基地建设收到预期效果。林业部计划司石峰认为，我国森林资源结构性断档不可避免。新型林工产品在弥补资源结构变化、缓解社会需求方面的作用不可低估。他建议加强林工产品科研工作，确定林工产业中短期发展目标，制定相应的配套政策，促进长期不被重视、至今还较落后的人造板材工业快速发展。
