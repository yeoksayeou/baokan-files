Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 8th.

Starting from the 5th, 160,000 telephone operators, technicians, and installers from three telephone companies in the United States went on strike to protest the company's attempt to reduce their medical insurance benefits. The strike has spread across 15 states and the capital, Washington. Over the past three days, direct line services have not been affected, but services requiring operator assistance, inquiries, telephone repairs, and installations have been delayed.

This strike occurred after negotiations for a new labor contract between the two parties broke down. During the negotiations, the management demanded that workers contribute to their medical insurance costs, but this was met with strong opposition from the workers. The workers believe that it is unreasonable for the company to reduce their medical insurance benefits while making huge profits year after year. According to reports, the current labor contracts of another three telephone companies will also expire soon. If the two parties cannot reach a new agreement, the workers of these three companies will also go on strike.

    美国16万电话职工罢工
    本报华盛顿8月8日电　记者张亮报道：从5日开始，美国3家电话公司的16万名话务员、技工和安装工举行罢工，抗议公司当局试图削减他们的医疗保险福利。这次罢工遍及全国15个州和首都华盛顿。罢工3天来虽然直线电话未受影响，但需话务员转线、查询服务、电话修理及安装则被延搁。
    这次罢工是劳资双方在谈判新的劳资合同破裂后举行的。在谈判中，资方要求工人支付部分医疗保险费，但遭到工人的坚决反对。工人们认为，在公司连年获得巨额利润的情况下削减工人的医疗保险福利是说不过去的。据报道，另外3家电话公司的现行劳资合同也将在近日内期满。如果劳资双方达不成新的合同，这3家公司的工人也将举行罢工。
