Jiangxi, a major freshwater fish production area in China, saw its total aquatic product output reach 25.59 million metric tons in 1988, more than four times the 6 million metric tons produced in 1978. The per capita aquatic product availability in the province increased from 1.85 kilograms in 1978 to 7.1 kilograms in 1988. The long-standing issue of "difficulty in obtaining fish in a land of fish and rice" has been significantly alleviated.

Reforms in the procurement and sales system, as well as the management system, have played a crucial role in revitalizing Jiangxi's aquatic product market. Since 1984, Jiangxi's aquatic product departments have closely collaborated with relevant departments to implement an integrated production, supply, and sales system, and a unified fishery, industry, and commerce management system. This has effectively overcome the issues of inter-departmental coordination and resolved the difficulties in selling and buying, thereby promoting aquaculture production.

Previously, when the aquatic products were solely managed by the commercial department, they were only marketed for four to five months a year, effectively operating only during the peak season. At that time, due to state financial subsidies, employees preferred to be idle during the off-season rather than explore the market. After the liberalization of aquatic products, financial subsidies were abolished, and many collective and individual vendors began to trade in aquatic products. Facing competition, state-owned aquatic product companies had to change their operating methods, shifting from waiting for fish to be brought to them to actively seeking out fish in fishing areas and supporting aquaculture production. During the peak purchasing season, aquatic product companies would drive to the ponds and lakesides to purchase fish on the spot. What pleased the fishermen even more was that even when there was an abundance of fish, the companies did not suppress prices. Last spring, during the Chinese New Year, the Qing Shan Fish Farm in Boyang County had 30,000 kilograms of fresh fish in storage that could not be sold, but the aquatic product company still purchased all of it at market prices. They also actively supported fishermen in developing production by providing seedlings, production materials, funds, and information. In 1988, the province's aquatic product supply and marketing system provided a total of 924.54 million yuan in non-planned aquatic production materials to fishermen, nearly double the amount in 1977, and issued over 500 million yuan in loans.

The reform of the supply and marketing system has also benefited consumers. Before the liberalization, many urban areas required coupons to purchase frozen fish. Now, fresh fish are available year-round, with varieties expanding from the big three of carp, silver carp, and grass carp to more than 20 varieties including white amur, eel, mandarin fish, and soft-shelled turtle. The increase in sales points has made it more convenient for the public to purchase fish. The annual price increase for fish in the province does not exceed 10%, which is lower than the price increase for other food items. For example, during the peak season, 500 grams of live silver carp costs only 1 yuan, grass carp costs 1.5 yuan, and the more expensive soft-shelled turtle costs only 11-12 yuan.

With the development of production, the northward shipment of freshwater fish has significantly increased. In 1988, a total of 5,441 metric tons of freshwater fish were shipped to provinces and cities in Northeast and Northwest China. Some specialty aquatic products were also sold to Hong Kong and Macau regions.

### 产供销一条龙  渔工商一体化  江西水产市场活跃

    产供销一条龙  渔工商一体化
    江西水产市场活跃
    本报讯　记者毕月华报道：我国淡水鱼重要产区江西省，1988年水产品总产量已达到25.59万吨，为1978年6万吨的4倍多，全省人均水产品占有量由1978年的1.85公斤提高到1988年的7.1公斤。长期以来存在的“鱼米之乡吃鱼难”的状况，得到了明显改善。
    购销体制和经营管理体制的改革，对活跃江西水产品市场起了重要作用。从1984年开始，江西水产部门与有关部门密切配合，实行产供销一条龙、渔工商一体化的经营管理体制，有效地克服了部门间互相扯皮的弊端，解决了卖难、买难，有力地促进了渔业生产。
    原来水产由商业部门独家经营时，一年只经营四至五个月，独家经营实际上变成了只在旺季经营。那时，由于有国家财政补贴，淡季里职工宁可吃闲饭，也不去开拓市场。水产品放开后，取消了财政补贴，许多集体、个体商贩也纷纷经营水产品。面对竞争，迫使国营水产公司改变经营方式，由过去等鱼上门变为深入鱼区积极求购，主动扶持渔业生产。在收购旺季里，水产公司开车到塘头湖边、就地收购。更使渔民感到满意的是，鱼多也不压级压价。去年春节，波阳县青山鱼场存塘鲜鱼3万公斤卖不出去，水产公司仍按市价全部收购过来。他们还积极扶持渔民发展生产，如提供苗种、生产资料、资金和信息。1988年全省水产供销系统共向渔民提供计划外渔需物资总值924.54万元，比1977年增长近一倍，还发放贷款500余万元。
    供销体制的改革给消费者也带来了好处。放开前，许多城镇冻鱼也要凭票供应，现在市场上一年四季鲜鱼不断，品种由鲢、鳙、草三大家鱼发展到鳊鱼、鳝鱼、鳜鱼、甲鱼等20多个品种。网点增多，使群众购买方便了。全省鱼价上浮幅度每年不超过10％，低于副食品上涨幅度。以500克计，旺季里活鲢鱼只1元，草鱼1.5元，名贵的甲鱼也不过11—12元。
    生产发展后，南鱼北调大幅度增加。1988年调往东北、西北等省市的淡水鱼共5441吨。一些特种水产品还销往港澳地区。
