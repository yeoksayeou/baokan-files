    Beijing recently issued new regulations for the recruitment of students by private higher education institutions in the city for the 1989 summer semester. The regulations stipulate that the enrollment plans for private higher education institutions must be reviewed and approved by the Beijing Municipal Adult Education Bureau. Institutions that have not obtained approval are not permitted to recruit students.

    These institutions must include the phrase "private-run education" after their names in all recruitment advertisements and brochures. Such materials must be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Adult Education Bureau before they can be published, broadcast, or posted. Private higher education institutions are not allowed to issue graduation certificates to their enrolled students but can issue certificates of completion or proof of study. Private higher education institutions in Beijing are only permitted to recruit students within the city and are not allowed to recruit nationwide.
