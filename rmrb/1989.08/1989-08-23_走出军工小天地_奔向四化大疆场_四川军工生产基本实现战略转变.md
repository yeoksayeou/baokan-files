The Sichuan military-industrial system has earnestly implemented the policy of "combining military and civilian use," focusing its main efforts on developing products essential for people's livelihood and equipment and raw materials urgently needed for production. It has basically achieved a strategic transformation in military-industrial production. Last year, the total value of civilian products produced by military-industrial enterprises in the province reached 2.5 billion yuan, for the first time accounting for two-thirds of the total military-industrial output. In the first half of this year, the production of civilian products in the military-industrial sector has maintained a steady growth trend.

Sichuan is a key area for the Third Front construction. Over 30 billion yuan has been invested, concentrating on a large number of defense science and technology industry projects, making Sichuan basically form a defense science and technology industry system with complete industries, relatively diverse categories, and a combination of production and scientific research experiments. At present, the Sichuan military-industrial system has more than 140 production enterprises, research institutes, and experimental bases, with 370,000 employees and fixed assets of more than 8 billion yuan. The total production capacity ranks first in the national military-industrial system. The successful launch of China's man-made satellite, the successful launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the normal operation of large-scale high-flux reactors, and the completion and use of the Chinese Tokamak-1 nuclear fusion device, all of which have attracted worldwide attention, have the contribution of Sichuan's defense science and technology industry.

Currently, Sichuan's defense science and technology industry has developed and produced 27 categories and more than 1,200 types of civilian products, with more than 400 types having the capacity for mass production.

    走出军工小天地　奔向四化大疆场
    四川军工生产基本实现战略转变
    四川军工系统认真贯彻“军民结合”的方针，把主要力量用于发展人民生活必需品和生产急需的设备及原材料，已基本上实现了军工生产的战略转变。去年，全省军工企业的民品产值达25亿元，首次在军工总产值中占2／3。今年上半年，军工民品生产仍然保持了稳定增长的势头。
    四川是三线建设的重点，先后投资300多亿元，集中安排了一大批国防科技工业项目，使四川基本形成了行业齐全、门类较多、生产与科研试验相结合的国防科技工业体系。现在，四川军工系统拥有生产企业、科研院所和试验基地达140多个，职工37万余人，固定资产80多亿元，总的生产能力占全国军工系统第一位。我国的人造卫星上天、洲际导弹发射成功、大型高通量反应堆正常运转和中国环流一号核聚变装置建成使用等举世瞩目的科技成果，都有四川国防科技工业的功劳。
    四川的国防科技工业，目前已开发生产了27类1200多种民品，有400多种形成了批量生产能力。
