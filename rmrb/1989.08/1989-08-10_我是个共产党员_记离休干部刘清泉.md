Four years ago in July, 64-year-old Liu Qingquan stepped down from his position as the director of the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau.

His retirement brought joy to his wife and grandchildren, filling the entire family with a festive atmosphere.

Over the past few decades, Liu Qingquan had devoted all his energy to his work, rarely able to spend time at home with his family, enjoying the pleasures of family life. Now that he was retired, how could the family not be happy?

Regarding how to spend his retirement years, Liu Qingquan waited until his wife and grandchildren had calmed down before sharing his plans with them. He said, "Shanxi Province is an ancient land, and on this land grow many ancient and rare trees. These ancient trees bear witness to the changes of nature, record the rise and fall of human history, and are symbols of ancient culture and scientific research treasures. However, due to the passage of time, wind and rain, lightning strikes, and human damage, there are now very few of them left. If we do not conduct timely surveys and record them, we will never find their traces again, which would be a great loss to humanity. In the past, some people have done work in this area, but due to the hardships of long journeys, they gave up halfway. I want to use my retirement to complete the survey of ancient trees across the province!"

His wife and children were stunned and expressed their opposition.

Liu Qingquan then spoke to his family, saying, "If someone goes to the city to handle business, they cannot leave halfway without completing the task. The same principle applies to revolution. Once you have embarked on the revolutionary path, you must struggle for revolution all your life. You cannot do it halfway and then stop. Although I am old and no longer suitable for leadership positions, I cannot think that being in a leadership position is the same as doing revolutionary work. Once you leave the leadership position, you stop doing revolutionary work. I must consciously find a position to struggle for the revolution, and the position I have found is to survey ancient trees!"

Surveying ancient trees, however, is not an easy task. First, these ancient trees are unknown in their locations, and every time you arrive at a place, you have to visit the locals and read the county annals. Second, these ancient trees, like those with "shyness," are either hidden in deep valleys or grow in remote villages, making the roads difficult to traverse. To conduct on-site surveys, one must endure hardships.

However, Liu Qingquan was not deterred by these difficulties. In surveying ancient trees, he wanted his actions to shine with brilliant light.

It was a day in early 1986 when Liu Qingquan went to a place called Zhijia Gorge in the deep mountains of Jingbei Dingxiang County to survey a large magnolia tree. He started early in the morning, walking on a narrow mountain path for 11 hours. By the time he returned to the county seat in the evening, his feet were covered with blisters, and he was so tired that he collapsed onto the bed and couldn't get up.

The county forestry bureau chief, seeing him in such a state, said sympathetically, "Director Liu, you are already retired and at an advanced age. Why do you have to endure such hardships? Stay here for a few days to rest, and I will send you back."

Liu Qingquan laughed and said, "I am not made of mud, so how can I melt away with a little wind and rain! A Communist Party member is not in this world for personal enjoyment. Therefore, at any time, one must not stop struggling!"

These words made the county forestry bureau chief nod in agreement.

One day in late autumn of 1986, Liu Qingquan went to Yangcheng County in Jindongnan to conduct a survey. At that time, it was the rainy season, and the mountain floods had risen. To survey the ancient trees, he had to cross a small river called Menghe, which had no bridge. He had to step on the exposed rocks in the water to cross. Liu Qingquan stepped on a rock, but it was slippery, and he slipped into the raging waters. His companions struggled to pull him out. In the deep autumn of the Taihang Mountains, the cold was biting, and after getting out of the water, his clothes were soaked, and the mountain wind made him shiver. He continued to run on the mountain path in his wet clothes, running until he was sweating and his clothes were dry before slowing down.

A young companion, puzzled, asked him, "Some retired cadres, once they retire, either become consultants for some company or directors for some center. But you, once you retire, you find such a hard job. What are you aiming for?"

After thinking for a moment, Liu Qingquan replied, "I aim to complete my revolutionary path with my actions, to let the people say that I am a Communist Party member, a qualified old cadre!"

The young man was so moved that he shed tears of emotion.

Over the past three years, Liu Qingquan has traversed 118 counties (cities) in Shanxi Province with his own legs. In these three years, he has visited hundreds of thousands of people, surveyed 544 townships and 722 villages, covering a distance of over 15,000 kilometers; he has taken tens of thousands of photographs of various ancient and rare trees and collected nearly a million words of materials.

Based on this, Liu Qingquan carefully organized the photographs he took and the materials he collected, and wrote a highly valuable book, "Ancient Trees of Shanxi." In this book, he selected 1,114 photographs and used 300,000 words of text to vividly describe and record the history, age, appearance, current status, and legends related to 1,114 representative ancient and rare trees in Shanxi Province.

According to experts, Liu Qingquan's book is the first of its kind in the country. Even internationally, such detailed works on ancient trees are rare. The great value of this book can be compared to the unearthed Qin terracotta warriors and Han tombs. It not only fills a gap in China's forestry research, bringing honor to the Chinese nation, but also provides extremely valuable materials for the study of hydrology, geology, meteorology, and other fields.

    “我是个共产党员”
    ——记离休干部刘清泉
    新华社记者　杨玉良
    4年前的7月，64岁的刘清泉，卸去了山西省林业厅厅长的职务。
    他的离休，使老伴和儿孙们都兴高采烈，全家充溢着欢愉的气氛。
    在过去的几十年里，刘清泉把心思都操持在工作上，很少能在家里同亲人团聚，享受一下天伦之乐。这下，他离休了，全家人怎能不高兴呢！
    对于怎样来打发晚年的时光，刘清泉等老伴和儿孙们都安静下来后，便把自己的打算告诉了大家。他说：“山西省是块古老的大地，在这块大地上生长着许多古老而珍奇的树木。这些古树奇木，铭刻着大自然的变化，记录着人类历史的盛衰兴替，它是历史的见证，大自然的档案，古文化的象征，科学研究的宝库，但由于沧海变迁，风吹雨打，雷击人损，如今已所剩无几了。现在如不及时考察并记录在案，今后就再也找不到它们的踪迹了，这将是人类的一大损失。过去，也有人作过这方面的工作，然而，因受不了那长途跋涉的艰辛，就半途而废了。我要在离休后，利用离休后的时日，完成对全省古稀树木的考察任务！”
    老伴和儿女们听了他的打算，都愣住了，纷纷表示反对。
    刘清泉对着家人，又发表了这样的宏论：“一个人进城办事，不能事没办，走到半路就折回来了。干革命也是这个理呀，既走了革命道路，就要为革命奋斗一辈子，不能干半截就不干了！我虽然老了，不适合在领导岗位上干了，但不能以为在领导岗位就是干革命，离开了领导岗位就不干革命了，我要自觉地寻找为革命而奋斗的岗位，我找到的合适岗位，就是考察古稀树木！”
    考察古稀树木，却不是件容易的事。一是这些古稀树木不知生长在何处，每到一地，都要访群众，阅县志。二是这些古稀树木，像患了“羞病”似的，不是长在深山幽谷，就是生在穷乡僻壤，道路难行，要实地考察，就要涉危受苦。
    可是，刘清泉并没有被这些困难吓倒，在考察古稀树木中，要使自己的言行闪烁出绚丽的光彩。
    那是1986年初的一天，刘清泉到晋北定襄县一个叫智家沟的深山考察一棵硕大的丁香树。他一大早就爬山，在山中的羊肠小道上，走了11个小时，晚上回到县城，两只脚掌上打满了水泡，累得一头栽倒在床上起不来了。
    县林业局长看到他累成这个样子，心痛地说：“老厅长，您都离休了，又这么大年纪，何必受这份苦呢，在这里休息几天，我送您回去吧！”
    刘清泉一听笑了起来。他说：“我又不是泥捏的，哪能一遇风雨就化了！一个共产党员，不是为自己的享受才来到人世间的。因此，任何时候都不能停止自己的奋斗！”
    这几句话，说得县林业局长连连点头称是。
    1986年深秋的一天，刘清泉来到晋东南阳城县进行考察。当时，正值雨季，山洪暴发，要考察古树，就要经过一条叫蒙河的小河，由于河上没桥，得踩着裸露出水面的大石头趟水而过。刘清泉踩着石头，没想到石头又湿又滑，一不小心，便滑倒在滚滚的洪水之中，随行的同志费了很大劲才把他救上岸来。太行山里的深秋，已是寒气逼人，他上岸后，全身透湿，山风吹得他索索发抖。他仍穿着湿衣服，在山路上奔跑起来，一直跑得头上冒汗，衣服被风吹干，才放慢了脚步。
    随行的一位年轻人，对他大惑不解地问道：“人家有的老干部，一退下来，不是在这个公司当顾问，就是在那个‘中心’当理事，您一退下来，却找了这么个苦差事，您这是图的啥呀！”
    对着这样的提问，刘清泉沉思了一会，作了这样的回答：“我图的是用自己的行动，走完一生的革命道路，图的是让人民群众说我是个共产党员，是个合格的老干部！”
    这位年轻人听了他的这一席话，感动得流出了热泪。
    3年多时间一天又一天过去了，刘清泉用自己的双腿，走遍了山西省的118个县（市）。这3年多来，他访问了成千上万的人民群众，对544个乡镇和722个村庄进行了考察，行程15000多公里；拍摄了上万幅各种古稀珍奇树木的照片，收集了近百万字的资料。
    在此基础上，刘清泉把自己所拍摄的照片和收集的资料加以精心整理，撰写出了一部极有价值的著作——《山西古稀树木》。在这部著作中，他选用了1114幅照片，用了30万字的文字，对山西省有代表性的1114棵古老珍奇的树木从历史沿革、树龄、树貌、现状，以及因树而引起的传说故事等进行了生动的描述和记载。
    据有关专家介绍，刘清泉所著的这部巨著，在国内尚属第一部，就是在国外，像这样翔实的专门介绍古稀树木的著作，也是寥寥无几的。这部著作的巨大价值，真可同出土的秦俑汉墓相媲美，它不但填补了我国林业研究上的一项空白，为中华民族争了光，而且对研究水文、地质、气象等提供了极为宝贵的材料。（新华社供本报专稿）
