Ghana is famous for its gold. However, it has another product that can rival gold, and that is cocoa, known as the "green gold." As a major pillar of Ghana's economy, cocoa export earnings typically account for 65% of the country's annual foreign exchange income, and cocoa export taxes account for 30% of government revenue. Ghana has a large cocoa production force – out of its 14.5 million population, 3.6 million people are engaged in the cocoa industry.

Ghana has been cultivating cocoa for over a century. From the 1920s onwards, Ghana was the world's largest cocoa producer and exporter for a considerable period, with annual production reaching as high as 600,000 tons. There was a vivid saying: every three pieces of chocolate in the world, one is made from Ghanaian cocoa. Ghana thus earned the title of the "Cocoa Capital of the World."

During our visit to Ghana, we often saw such scenes: lush green grasslands, vibrant flowers, tall and straight palm trees, lush banana groves, and oil palm trees laden with fruits. However, what left the deepest impression was the vast cocoa plantations. A Ghanaian friend proudly said, "Among these vibrant green lives, only the 'green gold' cocoa brings greater wealth and hope to our country." In Ghana's cities and countryside, whether in state-owned shops or traditional markets, cocoa oil, cocoa powder, cocoa paste, cocoa butter, and various beautifully packaged chocolates made from cocoa are everywhere.

Our Ghanaian friends told us, "In Ghana, if you only look at the gold mines and ignore the 'green gold,' it would be a pity." Therefore, arranged by the Ghana News Department, one afternoon after visiting the Ashanti Gold Mine, we drove to a cocoa plantation in Kumasi. The hospitable female owner, upon learning that we were Chinese journalists, showed a pure and friendly smile, warmly shaking hands to welcome us. Inside the plantation, the cocoa trees were neatly arranged, with branches and leaves covering the sky, and heavy cocoa pods hanging from the branches, some golden yellow and some tender purple, very beautiful. The owner introduced and cut down a cocoa pod with a knife, breaking it open to show us the cocoa beans, which were slightly larger than soybeans. She said that after removing the pod, the cocoa beans are piled up and covered with leaves to ferment for three to four days, turning them over two to three times, and then spread out on mats to dry. Of course, larger plantations often use more advanced methods for processing. She took us to see the cocoa beans drying on the mats. Those fermented and dried brown cocoa beans emitted a strong aroma. She said that after fermentation, the cocoa beans are ground and processed into cocoa powder, one of the world's three major beverages. Cocoa powder, when mixed with milk, sugar, nuts, and other ingredients, can be made into delicious and fragrant high-grade chocolate. The news officer accompanying us said that because cocoa powder is rich in nutrients, not only is it loved by ordinary people, but it is also an important food for astronauts and pilots.

Ghana's cocoa plantations are widely distributed, with some areas stretching over a hundred kilometers. It is reported that the national cocoa planting area reaches 1.6 million hectares, accounting for 57% of the national arable land. The cocoa planting season is from March to April each year. For the first four years, it is generally intercropped with grain crops. After five years, it begins to bear fruit, and after 7-10 years, it enters the peak fruiting period, capable of continuous harvesting for over 40 years. During our visit to Ghana, it was the late harvesting season, and we often saw women carrying baskets on their heads, coming and going to transport cocoa pods in the shade-covered plantations; by the village, there were patches of mats covered with cocoa beans.

However, since the 1970s, due to Western consuming countries lowering cocoa prices and the government's purchase prices being too low, some cocoa plantations have become barren or have been replanted with other crops, reducing the cocoa planting area. Additionally, some cocoa trees have aged, pests and diseases have spread, and market management has been mismanaged, causing Ghana's cocoa industry to decline, significantly affecting the country's income.

After the "National Provisional Defense Council" took power, to change this situation, a series of measures were taken to promote the recovery and development of cocoa production. The Minister of Agriculture, during our meeting, said: "Since 1983, the government has raised the purchase price of cocoa products six times, increasing it from 4,000 cedis per ton to the current 140,000 cedis. Additionally, the government provides a subsidy of 10,000 cedis per ton to cocoa farmers, and has restored 150,000 acres of burned cocoa plantations." The government also awards various material rewards to cocoa farmers to encourage them to increase cocoa production. Recently, Ghana has also developed its own cocoa processing industry, building several cocoa processing plants, with products exported to dozens of countries in Europe and America.

To further increase cocoa production, the Ghanaian government began implementing a five-year cocoa revitalization plan last year, investing $89.1 million for this purpose. When talking about the current problems in cocoa production, the Minister of Agriculture said: "First, there is a lack of funds, and second, the price suppression by Western countries brings us difficulties, reducing $100 million in exports in 1988 alone." However, he firmly believes that as long as the revitalization plan is realized, the "green gold" will shine again in Ghana.

    为了“绿色金子”重放光芒
    ——加纳可可业一瞥
    本报记者　申明河
    加纳黄金世界驰名。而它还有一种可与黄金媲美的物产，那就是被称为“绿色金子”的可可。作为加纳经济的主要支柱，可可出口收入一般占这个国家年出口外汇总收入的65％，可可出口税占政府财政收入的30％。加纳有一支庞大的可可生产大军——全国1450万人口中就有360万人从事可可业。
    加纳种植可可已有百余年历史。从本世纪20年代起，加纳在相当长时期内曾是世界上最大的可可生产国和出口国，年产可可最高达60万吨。曾有一个形象的说法：世界上的巧克力糖每三块中就有一块是用加纳可可制作的。加纳因而有“世界可可之乡”美称。
    在加纳采访期间，记者不时看到这样的景色：碧绿柔软的草地、争奇斗艳的花卉、笔直高耸的椰树、苍翠欲滴的蕉林、硕果累累的油棕树。但印象最深的，还是遍野丛生的可可林……。加纳朋友不无自豪地说：“在这些生机勃勃的绿色生命中，唯有‘绿色金子’可可给我国带来更大的财富和希望。”在加纳城乡，无论是国营商店还是传统的市场，用可可制成的可可油、可可粉、可可酱、可可脂和各式包装的精美的巧克力糖举目可见。
    加纳朋友对我们说：“在加纳只看金矿而不看‘绿色金子’那将是件憾事。”于是，在加纳新闻部的安排下，一天下午在参观阿散蒂金矿后，我们驱车来到库马西市的一个可可种植园。好客的女主人听说我们是中国记者，脸上露出纯朴的笑容，热情握手欢迎。种植园内，可可树排列整齐，枝叶蔽天，沉甸甸的可可豆荚挂满枝头，有的金黄，有的嫩紫，煞是好看。女主人边介绍边用刀割下一个可可豆荚并破开取出比蚕豆稍大的可可豆给我们看。她说，剥去豆荚后的可可豆集中堆放，用树叶覆盖发酵三四天，并翻腾两三次，然后放在席子上晒干。当然，规模大的种植园往往采用更先进的方法加工。她带我们参观了在晒席上晾晒的可可豆。那些经过发酵后晾晒的棕色可可豆，散发出阵阵浓郁的香气。她说，发酵后的可可豆经过研磨、加工，最后制成可可粉，就成为世界三大饮料之一。可可粉配上牛奶、糖、果仁等原料就可制成美味香甜的高级巧克力。陪同我们的新闻官员说，由于可可粉营养丰富，不仅一般人喜爱，还是宇航员、飞行员等的重要食品。
    加纳的可可园分布极广，有些地方可可园绵延百余公里。据介绍，全国可可种植面积达160万公顷，占全国耕地面积的57％。可可种植季节是每年3至4月，头4年一般与粮食作物间作，5年后开始产果，7—10年进入盛果期，能连续采收40多年。我们在加纳采访期间，正值收获季节后期，不时看到在浓荫覆盖的种植园内，妇女头顶萝筐往返运送可可豆荚；村边一片片晒席上铺满了可可豆。
    但是，70年代以来，由于西方消费国压低可可价格，又由于政府收购价格偏低，有的可可园荒芜或被改种其他作物，可可种植面积减少，加之有些可可树老化、病虫害蔓延和市场管理失当，加纳可可业有所衰退，国家的收入大受影响。
    加纳“全国临时保卫委员会”执政后，为改变这种情况，采取一系列措施推动可可生产的恢复和发展。农业部长在会见我们时说：“1983年以来，政府6次提高可可产品收购价格，使每吨4000塞地提高到目前的14万塞地。另外，政府还给可可种植者每吨1万塞地的补贴，同时，恢复了15万英亩被烧毁的可可种植园。”政府还给可可农颁发各种物质奖励，以激励他们提高可可产量。近来，加纳还发展自己的可可加工业，兴建一些可可加工厂，产品远销欧美数十个国家。
    为进一步提高可可产量，加纳政府从去年开始实施一项五年可可振兴计划，为此，将投资8910万美元。在谈到目前可可生产存在的问题时，农业部长说：“一是缺乏资金，二是西方国家压价给我们带来困难，仅1988年一年就减少了一亿美元的出口。”但他深信，只要实现振兴计划，“绿色金子”终将在加纳重放光芒。
