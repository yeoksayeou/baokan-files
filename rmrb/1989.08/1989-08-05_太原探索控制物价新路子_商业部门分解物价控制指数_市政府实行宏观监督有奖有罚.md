Taiyuan Explores New Ways to Control Prices

The commercial departments decompose the price control index

The municipal government implements macro supervision with rewards and penalties

Our reporter Yan Xiaoming reported from Taiyuan on August 5th: In controlling prices, Taiyuan City has made some intentional explorations and recently introduced a new measure—the municipal government and the responsible persons of various commodity management departments sign price control target responsibility letters.

The main content of this measure is: the price control index of various commodities within the year is decomposed to the relevant departments, which are responsible for controlling, and specific requirements for achieving the target are formulated. The target responsibility system stipulates: for units that complete this year's price control target and meet the requirements, the government will commend the units and main responsible persons or give appropriate rewards; for those that fail to complete the task, the units and main responsible persons will be criticized or economically penalized.

Recently, Mayor Wan Liang said, controlling the rise of prices requires a two-pronged approach. One is to strengthen supervision and deal with one case at a time; the other is to control from a macro perspective, setting a specific price control target for units that have the conditions to raise prices and linking it to their economic indicators. In this way, the government, supervisory departments, and commodity management departments are tied together. The three are no longer opponents but form a "united front," making things much easier.

Currently, the departments that have signed price control responsibility letters with the government mainly include the management departments of grains and oils, eggs, vegetables, meat, poultry, clothing, daily necessities, fresh milk, medicines, and building materials.

It is reported that each department will also implement layer-by-layer price control target responsibilities internally.

    太原探索控制物价新路子
    商业部门分解物价控制指数
    市政府实行宏观监督有奖有罚
    本报太原8月5日电　记者阎晓明报道：在控制物价方面做出一些有意探索的太原市，最近又推出一项新措施——由市政府与各类商品主管部门的负责人签订物价控制目标责任书。
    这一措施的主要内容是：把各类商品年内的物价控制指数分解到有关的部门，由具体部门来控制，并制订了达标的具体要求。目标责任制规定：对完成今年物价控制目标及达标要求的单位，政府将通报表扬单位和主要负责人或给予适当奖励；对完不成任务的，给予单位和主要负责人通报批评或经济处罚。
    太原市市长万良适日前说，控制物价上涨要采取两手抓的办法，一是加强监督，抓住一个处理一个；二是从宏观上控制，给有条件涨价的单位限定一个具体的控制物价目标，并与它的经济指标联系起来。这样，就把政府、监督部门、主管商品的部门拴在一条绳子上。三家不再是对立面，而是结成“统一战线”，事情就好办多了。
    目前，与政府签订物价控制责任书的，主要是粮油、蛋菜肉禽、衣着、日用工业品、鲜奶、药材、建材等商品的主管部门。
    据悉，各部门内部也将实行层层的物价控制责任目标。
