The Party Committee of the Wa Fang Dian Bearing Factory in Liaoning Province has shown concern for and demanded political integrity from its party members, fostering a cadre of party members who are politically steadfast. In the intense struggle against the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion, thousands of party members stood out, leading and influencing tens of thousands of workers to firmly support the decisions of the Party Central Committee, playing a pivotal role. The experience of this factory's Party Committee is of typical significance in summarizing the struggle against the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion, and in considering the future of party-building work.

Caring for and demanding political integrity from party members has been the responsibility of party organizations since the Party's inception. The Party is the vanguard of the working class, and party organizations must, of course, urge party members to be good "vanguard fighters." It is regrettable that, under the impact of bourgeois liberalization, some party organizations have become so confused in their thinking that they seem to have forgotten this basic fact. Some party organizations pay no attention to the political qualities of party members, resulting in some party members being at a loss in the face of political storms; some party organizations have simply abandoned political demands on party members, watching helplessly as some use their party member status to brazenly attack the four cardinal principles and advocate bourgeois liberalization; and a few party organizations even mistakenly supported some illegal and disorderly "great democracy" activities during the turmoil and rebellion. Although these party organizations are in the minority, the damage they have caused to the Party's cause is not small.

Party organizations must care for and demand political integrity from party members, as this is determined by the Party's discipline. The history of the Party proves that the strength of the Party lies in the quality of its members, in the political qualities of its members, not in their numbers. Whether or not one has the desire and request to apply for Party membership is a matter of personal freedom. However, joining the Party has conditions, and once one has joined, one must consciously support the Party's political program, observe the Party's constitution, and consciously accept the Party organization's political demands and education. Wanting to obtain the title of party member while also wanting to live a "free" life without organizational supervision or political constraints is not acceptable; and for those who brazenly advocate bourgeois liberalization while claiming to be "party member elites," such absurd phenomena are even less acceptable. For these so-called "party member elites," we must clearly oppose them and strip them of their "Communist Party member" cloak. Without iron discipline, political demands will become empty talk, and political concern will inevitably be one-sided.

The recent turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion have provided our Party with many valuable lessons. Every loyal Communist Party member will recognize the importance of demanding political integrity from oneself, and realize that maintaining the correct direction in complex political struggles is not easy. If everyone, like the Party Committee of the Wa Fang Dian Bearing Factory, "regardless of east, west, south, or north wind, firmly holds onto the Party's leadership without relaxation," and closely revolves around "one central task, two basic points" to demand and care for party members, and strives to do so effectively and concretely, then improving the quality of the broad masses of party members will be guaranteed.

    从政治上关心要求党员
    本报评论员
    辽宁省瓦房店轴承厂党委从政治上关心党员，要求党员，带出一支政治上过得硬的党员队伍。在这场惊心动魄的反动乱和反暴乱斗争中，几千名党员挺身而出，带动和影响了几万名职工坚定不移地拥护党中央的决策，起到了中流砥柱作用。这个厂党委的经验对于总结反动乱和反暴乱的斗争，对于思考党建工作的未来，都有典型意义。
    从政治上关心党员，要求党员，从党诞生之日起就是党组织的职责。党是工人阶级的先锋队，党组织当然要督促党员当好“先锋队员”。令人痛心的是，在资产阶级自由化的冲击下，少数党组织思想混乱得连这个常识都似乎不懂了。有些党组织对党员的政治素质漠不关心，致使一些党员在政治风浪中无所措手足；有些党组织干脆放弃了对党员的政治要求，眼看着有人以党员身份猖狂地攻击四项基本原则、鼓吹资产阶级自由化而见怪不怪；还有极个别党组织甚至在动乱和暴乱中错误地支持某些违法乱纪的“大民主”行为。这些党组织虽然属于少数，但对党的事业造成的损失不可谓小。
    党组织要从政治上关心党员，要求党员，也是党的纪律所决定的。党的历史证明，党的力量从来在于党员的质量，在于党员政治素质，而不在于数量。一个人是否有申请入党的愿望和要求，是每个人的自由。但是，入党是有条件的，一旦入了党，就必须自觉地拥护党的政治纲领，遵守党的章程，自觉地接受党组织在政治上的要求和教育。既想获得党员称号，又想过没有组织监督、没有政治约束的“自由”生活，这是不行的；至于拚命鼓吹资产阶级自由化还标榜自己是“党员精英”，这种荒唐现象更为党的纪律所不容。对此类所谓的“党员精英”，要旗帜鲜明地与之斗争，剥下他们的“共产党员”外衣。没有铁的纪律，政治上的要求就会流于空谈，而政治上的关心也难免一厢情愿。
    刚刚过去的这场动乱和反革命暴乱给我们党提供了许多宝贵教材。每一个忠诚的共产党员都会认识到从政治上要求自己的重要性，醒悟到在复杂的政治斗争中坚持正确的方向并非易事。如果大家都像瓦房店轴承厂党委那样，“不管东西南北风，坚持党的领导不放松”，紧紧围绕“一个中心，两个基本点”要求党员，关心党员，并力求有声有色，切实有效，那么，提高广大党员的素质就有保证。
