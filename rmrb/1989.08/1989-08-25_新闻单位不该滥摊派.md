Recently, a manager of a street-level enterprise vented his frustrations to the author: "In the first half of this year, news organizations from the city have come to our door nearly ten times. Each time, reporters from newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations would start with: 'Your factory is doing well and has a bit of a reputation in our area. Our newspaper is planning to report on you, which will also increase your personal and enterprise's reputation. However, our newspaper is currently facing some difficulties, and your enterprise needs to provide 2,000 yuan in 'sponsorship fees' for a 1,000-word character report.'"

The manager continued, "Isn't it because the newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations control the power of public opinion that enterprises dare not offend them?!"

Coincidentally, a certain city's radio station recently broadcast a lengthy report on an individual entrepreneur, portraying a tax evader who had been fined as a model of individual moral excellence. After listening, one truly feels both angry and uncomfortable. Later, it was revealed that the radio station had received 700 yuan from him, which is why his reputation soared.

Currently, the widespread practice of arbitrary fees and excessive levies that has enterprises and individual entrepreneurs complaining is indeed related to the involvement of news organizations. News organizations are supposed to be the mouthpieces of the Party and the people, aiming to sing praises of righteousness and criticize social ills. However, some people are engaging in various forms of 'sponsorship fees,' 'fundraising fees,' and the like. How can public opinion propaganda be convincing in this way? Currently, various industries are undergoing rectification, and some people in certain news organizations who are enthusiastic about this should also reflect on themselves.

### 新闻单位不该滥摊派

    新闻单位不该滥摊派
    日前，一位街道企业厂长对笔者发牢骚道：“今年上半年里，市新闻单位就找上门近十次，每次报社、电台和电视台记者‘开场白’不外乎是：你们厂子搞的不错，在咱们地区小有名气，我们报社准备报一报，这样一来，也提高了你本人和企业的知名度。但是，目前，我们报社有些困难，你们企业得拿2000元钱的‘赞助费’，给你发一篇1000字左右的人物通讯。……”这位厂长接着又说道：“不就是因为报社、电台和电视台掌握着舆论宣传大权，企业得罪不起吗？！”
    无独有偶。某市电台近日接连播发了一位个体户的长篇报告文学，把一个偷税挨罚的典型，却偏偏写成了个精神文明个体户，听罢，真让人既气愤又别扭。事后据知情者透露，是电台收了他700元钱，才使之名声大振的。
    时下使企业、个体户怨声载道的乱收费、滥摊派的不正之风之所以屡禁不绝，且愈演愈烈，看来确与新闻单位的染指有关。
    新闻单位本是党和人民的喉舌，以讴歌正气，针砭时弊为宗旨，可有些人却乱搞什么“赞助费”、“集资费”等等，这样一来，舆论宣传怎能令人信服呢？目前，各行各业正在清理整顿，某些新闻单位热衷于此道的一些人也该反躬自问吧？
