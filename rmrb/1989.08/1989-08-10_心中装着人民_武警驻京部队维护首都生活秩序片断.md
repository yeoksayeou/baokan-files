Electricity, coal gas, and salt are indispensable items in people's daily lives. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in the capital Beijing, many people were constantly worried about the supply of electricity, gas, and salt. However, do you know that in those turbulent days, how many armed police officers silently fought day and night on their posts to safeguard the normal life order of the people in the capital!

	“This is the duty of the armed police soldiers”

	The 15th Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Armed Police Corps is responsible for guarding the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant. The officers and soldiers deeply understand that the power plant is responsible for the electricity needs of the people in the capital, and if it stops, it will have a great impact on the people's electricity use.

	“To safeguard the absolute safety of the power plant and ensure the power supply to the capital is the duty of the armed police soldiers!” The officers and soldiers expressed the same sentiment.

	Soldier Cui Xianfeng has a nasal tumor that bleeds when it gets hot. The doctor advised him to be hospitalized for surgery, but he insisted on going to his post. For more than 40 days and nights, he endured the pain with unyielding willpower and remained on his duty post.

	Soldier Wang Wenbin enlisted from Shanxi in 1987. During the turmoil and riots, he received a telegram from home saying, "Father is seriously ill, hurry back." To be honest, he really wanted to go home to see his old father who raised him. But then he thought, this is a critical moment of the battle, the company is short of personnel, and the patrol tasks are heavy... Thinking of this, he immediately dismissed the idea and vigilantly guarded the power plant.

	One day, a worker swaggered towards the factory gate. Wang Wenbin, according to the regulations, asked him to show his ID, but the worker not only refused to show it but also spoke rudely. Little Wang still spoke to him politely.

	“Standing guard and patrolling, though monotonous and tedious, is a heavy responsibility!”

	Soldier Tian Aiming has not had a good rest for many days and nights, and his eyes are filled with bloodshot. One day, it was his turn to patrol the power plant. Looking at the machines working normally, he thought of the people in the capital using electricity normally, and his heart was sweet.

	The machines roared, deafening. Tian Aiming searched from one machine to another. One hour... one and a half hours. Suddenly, he found that one machine seemed to have an abnormality. A closer look revealed that there was indeed a problem. He immediately reported this situation to the factory, avoiding a potential accident.

	“A True ‘Steel Ingot Unit’”

	“Steel Ingot Unit!” This is the high praise given by the workers of the Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Company's refinery to the armed police company guarding the refinery.

	It was the early morning of June 4th, and Beijing had just quelled the counter-revolutionary riots. At this moment, armed police soldiers Wang Long and Li Tie were on duty at the south gate of the refinery. For many days, they had not had a good rest, but they were still in high spirits. Suddenly, a chaotic sound of footsteps and noise came from afar. Immediately, a crowd surged out. Some of them were talking at the same time, some said, “What's the use of being a soldier now!” Others said, “Just hand over the guns to us, and we'll guard the gate for you!” To this, they firmly replied, “Protecting the refinery is the task given by the Party and the people, and it is the duty of the armed police soldiers!” The crowd then quietly slipped away.

	On one morning in late May, after the guards finished their breakfast, some were tidying up their quarters, and some were reading newspapers.

	“Fire!” Suddenly, a urgent call for help came from afar. The soldiers looked up and saw a thick smoke mixed with flames rising from afar.

	Fire is the order! Dozens of officers and soldiers immediately grabbed fire-fighting equipment and rushed to the scene at the fastest speed.

	The fire scene was an oil pool 80 meters long and wide. At this moment, hundreds of tons of waste oil were exploding and burning. Smoke billowed, and flames soared. Just ten meters away from the fire scene, the outside of the laboratory with several oxygen cylinders just filled with gas was already hot and could explode at any moment. To rescue state property, the officers and soldiers disregarded their lives, rushed forward without hesitation, and quickly moved 17 oxygen cylinders to a safe area. At the same time, two soldiers fiercely broke open the locked laboratory door, risking their lives to rescue flammable drugs.

	The fire became more and more intense, and the soldiers fought more bravely. Several officers and soldiers, together with the Yanshan Fire Brigade, fought fiercely in the light oil tank area. Here, only a road separated it from the fire scene. If the fire spread over, the consequences would be unimaginable. The officers and soldiers stood in knee-deep water, lined up like a barrier, holding fire extinguishers, and sprayed the fire scene. After more than 5 hours of fierce struggle, they finally extinguished the fire, saved the oil tank area, and ensured the supply of liquefied gas in the Beijing area.

	“The Salt Transportation Team for the People”

	Just after the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing were decisively quelled, due to traffic congestion, salt became a major problem in the lives of the people in the capital.

	“The difficulties of the masses are the difficulties of the troops!” The armed police troops stepped forward and immediately organized dozens of officers and soldiers from the rear service base to form a salt transportation team.

	At the gathering point, the deputy director of the logistics department of the armed police headquarters, Major General Wang Guozhong, issued a call to action: “We are the armed police, the children of the people. Today, the people of the capital are facing difficulties in getting salt, and we have the responsibility to help the people!”

	At the Xizhimen wholesale warehouse, people cheered and rushed towards the military vehicles. “Welcome the armed police officers!” The slogans echoed, and there was a deep bond between the police and the people.

	Under the leadership of Major General Wang Guozhong, the salt transportation team, loaded with the hopes of the people of the capital, slowly drove out of the warehouse. The red banner on the top of the car, “Armed Police Salt Transportation Team,” was prominently displayed.

	The caravan passed through layer upon layer of roadblocks, advancing with difficulty, and after several hours of hard work, finally delivered 50 tons of salt to 10 points in Haidian and Xicheng districts.

    心中装着人民
    ——武警驻京部队维护首都生活秩序片断
    电、煤气、食盐，是人们日常生活中不可缺少的生活用品。在首都北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，多少人的心时时担心着电、气、盐的供应呵。但是，你可知道，在那动荡的日子里，为保卫首都人民的正常生活秩序，有多少武警官兵日日夜夜、默默无闻奋战在自己的岗位上啊！
          “这是武警战士的职责”
    武警北京总队某部15中队担负着北京石景山发电总厂的警卫任务。干部战士深深明白，发电总厂担负着首都人民用电的需求，一旦停转，人民用电将会受到极大影响。
    “保卫发电厂的绝对安全，保证首都供电，这是武警战士义不容辞的职责！”指战员们发出同一个心声。
    战士崔贤峰鼻子长了个肉瘤，一热就流血，医生让他住院做手术，但他坚持上岗。40多个日日夜夜，他以顽强的毅力忍受病痛煎熬，始终坚守战斗岗位。
    战士王文斌是1987年从山西入伍的，在动乱和暴乱期间，一连收到从家寄来的“父病重速归”的电报。说实话，他是多么希望能回家见一面养育自己成人的老父亲呵！可转而一想，当前正是决战的关键时刻，中队人员紧张，执勤任务又重……。想到这里，他立即打消了这个念头，毅然警惕地守卫着发电厂。
    一天，一位民工大摇大摆地朝厂门走来，王文斌按照规定，请他出示证件，这个民工非但不示证，还出言不逊。小王仍好言讲道理。
    “站岗放哨，虽单调乏味，但却责任重大！”
    战士田爱民已有多少个日日夜夜没有好好休息，眼里布满了血丝。一天，又轮到他担任发电总厂的流动哨。他望着这一台台正常工作的机器，想到首都人民能正常用电，心里甜丝丝的。
    机器轰鸣着，震耳欲聋。田爱民一台机器一台机器地“搜索着”。一个小时……一个半小时。突然，他发现一台机器似乎发生了异常现象，仔细一看，果真出了问题。他立即将这一情况报告给了厂部，避免了一起可能发生的事故。
      名副其实的“钢锭部队”
    “钢锭部队！”这是北京燕山石化公司炼油厂职工对守卫炼油厂武警中队的高度赞誉。
    那是6月4日清晨，北京刚刚平息反革命暴乱。此时此刻，武警战士王龙、李铁笔正在炼油厂南大门执勤。多少个日子没有得到好好休整了，但他俩却依然精神振作。突然，从远处传来一阵杂乱的脚步声和嘈杂声。紧接着，一伙人群涌了出来，他们中有的七嘴八舌，有的说：“现在当兵有啥用！”还有的说：“还是把枪交给我们吧，我们替你们站岗！”对此，他俩坚定地回答：“保卫炼油厂是党和人民交给的任务，是我们武警战士的职责！”那伙人便悄悄地溜掉了。
    5月底的一天早晨，警卫中队干部战士吃完早餐，有的在整理内务，有的在读书看报。
    “救火！”突然，一阵急促的呼救声从远处传来。战士们抬头一看，只见远处一股浓烟夹着火头冲天而起。
    火光就是命令！数十名干部战士立刻携带扑火工具以最快速度奔赴火场。
    火场是一个长宽各80米的废油池。此刻，数百吨废油爆裂着、燃烧着。浓烟滚滚，火光冲天。离火场仅十米处的化验室外刚充足气的十几个氧气瓶已被烤得滚烫，随时有爆炸危险。为了抢救国家财产，干部战士置生死于度外，不顾一切地冲了过去，将17个氧气瓶一一迅速转移到安全地带。与此同时，两名战士猛烈撞开被锁着的化验室大门，冒着危险抢救出烈性药品。
    火势越来越猛，战士们也越战越勇。数名干部战士和燕山消防队一起，奋战在轻油罐区。这里与火场只一条马路之隔，一旦火势蔓延过来，后果不堪设想。指战员们脚踩没膝深的积水，一字排开犹如一堵屏障，手提灭火器，向火场猛射。经过整整5个多小时的激烈搏斗，终于扑灭了这场大火，保住了油罐区，保证了北京地区液化气的供应。
          “为民运盐队”
    北京平息反革命暴乱刚刚取得了决定性的胜利，由于交通阻塞，盐，一度成了首都人民的生活中一大难题。
    “人民群众的困难就是部队的困难！”武警部队挺身而出，立即由后勤基地抽调数十名干部战士组成了一支突击运盐队。
    在集结地，武警总部后勤部部长王国忠少将发出动员：“我们武警是人民子弟兵，今天，首都人民吃盐遇到困难，我们就有责任为人民群众解难！”
    西直门批发库，人们欢呼着涌向军车。“热烈欢迎武警官兵！”口号此起彼伏，一片警民鱼水之情。
    运盐车队在王国忠少将带领下，满载着首都人民的期望缓缓驶出了批发库。车顶上，“武警为民运盐队”红色横标赫然醒目。
    车队绕过层层路障，艰难行进，经过几个小时奋战，终于将50吨食盐一一分送到海淀和西城区的10个点。
