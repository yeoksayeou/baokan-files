Bulgaria's Savings Bank has been well-managed, with its total deposits increasing year by year. The latest statistical data published by the Bulgarian National Statistical Office shows that over the past nine years since 1980, the total deposits in Bulgaria's Savings Bank have increased by 73.7 percent. In 1988, the total investment for the development of the national economy accounted for only 71 percent of the year's bank deposits, and the investment for housing construction accounted for only 41.3 percent of housing savings.

The Savings Bank has been able to maintain a steady increase in deposits mainly due to the establishment of various incentive deposit projects, such as housing savings and car savings. Additionally, agreements have been made with relevant parties to give priority purchasing policies to those who save for specific purposes.

    保储蓄银行存款稳定增长
    保加利亚储蓄银行经营有方，存款总额逐年增长。保加利亚国家统计局最新出版的统计资料表明，在一九八○年以来的近九年中，保加利亚储蓄银行存款总额增加百分之七十三点七。一九八八年国家用于发展国民经济的总投资仅占当年银行存款的百分之七十一，住房建设投资仅占住房储蓄的百分之四十一点三。
    储蓄银行能长期保持存款稳定增长，主要是由于设立各种有鼓励作用的存款项目，如住房储蓄、汽车储蓄等，并同有关方面商定，对专项储蓄者实行购置优先政策。
