	This year, the supply and demand situation in the international oil market has become more reasonable, and oil prices have remained firm. Especially since March, oil prices have been rising steadily. On March 17, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil reached $20 per barrel, and by March 30, it surpassed $21 per barrel. By April 20, it had soared to $24.625 per barrel, the highest level since the oil price crash in early 1986. The second quarter is typically a low-demand season for oil, but the prices have remained so high, which was unexpected by most people and has revealed some noteworthy new features.

	The first feature is the robust demand, which has significantly eased the supply-demand imbalance. For several years, the oil market has been oversupplied, leading to weak prices. However, since the beginning of this year, despite OPEC's continued overproduction, the average daily production of OPEC in the first half of the year has been above 20 million barrels, but it has not put pressure on the market. Since this year, the International Energy Agency has repeatedly increased its estimates for the world's oil demand this year, with the latest estimate in June being 52 million barrels per day, a growth rate of 2.4%. This is mainly due to the sustained economic growth in Western developed countries, leading to strong oil consumption. At the same time, this also indicates that the low oil prices since 1986 have indeed stimulated oil consumption. The region with the most significant increase in oil consumption this year is the Asia-Pacific region, with a growth rate of 5%. In the first quarter, due to strong demand, the United States saw a significant increase in imports, reaching 7.8 million barrels per day, accounting for 45% of the total domestic demand, an increase of 560,000 barrels per day compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that this strong demand will continue until the early 1990s and even 1995. Due to the robust demand, this year may become a turning point for the international oil market, moving from chaos to order and from oversupply to a more balanced supply-demand situation.

	The aforementioned features of the oil market this year require us to pay sufficient attention to the role of demand changes in analyzing the supply-demand relationship in the future.

	The second feature is that various oil fields, pipelines, oil tankers, and refineries have experienced frequent unexpected accidents this year. For example, in late March, there was an oil spill incident in the Alaskan oil fields in North America. Following the platform explosion in the North Sea oil fields in the UK in July last year, another explosion occurred on April 18 this year due to a pipeline gas leak. A gas field explosion in the Soviet Union resulted in the deaths of 460 people. Additionally, there have been multiple explosions and shipwrecks involving oil tankers and refineries this year. These accidents are undoubtedly random, but they have had different degrees of impact on the market. At the same time, we should see the necessary factors behind these random events. This is that low oil prices have made it difficult to resume production in high-cost oil fields, and the reduction in maintenance costs for oil field facilities has significantly increased the accident rate in old oil fields. This makes it possible for these factors influencing oil prices to become regular factors.

	The third feature is that non-OPEC oil production has started to decline. Since 1989, non-OPEC crude oil production has decreased by 3.2%, with the most significant reductions in the United States and the UK. The United States' production has dropped to 7.6 million barrels per day, a decrease of 5.5%, with domestic oil accounting for less than 55% of total consumption, the lowest level since the 1960s, and this trend is continuing. The production in the North Sea oil fields in the UK has decreased by 700,000 to 800,000 barrels per day. The Soviet Union's production in the first quarter decreased by 2.5% compared to the same period last year, and so on. The decline in non-OPEC oil production has provided OPEC with a favorable opportunity to regain market share.

	The fourth feature is that internal conflicts within OPEC have relatively eased. The 84th and 85th OPEC meetings reached production quota agreements involving all member states, although the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were not satisfied with their respective quotas, they still agreed to participate in the agreement. This is less of a threat to OPEC compared to the share dispute between Iran and Iraq due to the war. This makes it easier for OPEC to coordinate internally compared to the previous two years. The current situation of easing supply-demand contradictions in the oil market makes it relatively easier for OPEC to resolve internal conflicts, and the reduction or easing of OPEC's internal differences, in turn, adds stability to the oil market.

	The fifth feature is that OPEC's production and income have significantly increased in the first half of this year, which is quite different from previous years. Before 1985, OPEC's market share was gradually being squeezed, and oil revenue was decreasing year by year; in 1986, although production increased and market share expanded, oil revenue plummeted due to the oil price crash; in 1987, oil prices rebounded, and revenue increased, but market share decreased again; in 1988, market share increased, but due to weak oil prices, revenue was not ideal. However, this year, OPEC not only has an average daily production of over 20 million barrels but also has significantly increased oil revenue due to firm oil prices. At the same time, due to the appreciation of the US dollar, OPEC's oil revenue purchasing power has greatly increased. In the past six months, the purchasing power of each dollar of oil revenue has increased by 11%, and each barrel of oil sold can purchase two-thirds more goods. Therefore, this year, OPEC can be said to have achieved a bumper harvest in both production share and oil revenue.

	The new features that have emerged in the international oil market have not only promoted the current rise in oil prices but will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future oil market.

    今年国际石油市场新特点
    王伟
    今年以来，国际石油市场供求情况趋于合理，油价保持坚挺。特别是进入3月份以后，油价节节攀升，美国西得克萨斯中质油3月17日每桶价格破20美元，3月30日破21美元，到4月20日竟高达24.625美元，这是1986年初油价暴跌以来的最高水平。二季度通常是用油淡季，油价仍保持如此高的水平，出乎大多数人的预料，同时显露了一些值得注意的新特点。
    特点之一是，需求旺盛，市场上供求矛盾大为缓和。几年以来石油市场供过于求，油价疲软。而今年年初以来，尽管欧佩克一直在超配额生产，上半年欧佩克平均日产量在2000万桶以上，但并没有给市场造成压力。今年以来，国际能源机构一再调高其对今年世界石油需求量的估计，6月份的最新估计为5200万桶／日，增长率为2.4％。这主要是今年西方发达国家经济增长势头不减，石油消费旺盛。同时，这也说明1986年以来的低油价确实刺激了对石油的消费。今年石油消费增长最为显著的是亚太地区，增长率达5％。今年一季度美国因需求旺盛，国内生产减少而导致进口量猛增，达到780万桶／日，占美国国内总需求量的45％，比去年同期增加56万桶／日。据估计，这种旺盛的需求将保持到90年代初以至1995年。由于需求旺盛，今年有可能成为国际石油市场由乱到治，由供过于求到供求较平衡的转折点。
    今年石油市场上出现的上述特点，要求我们今后在分析供求关系这对基本因素时，应该对需求变化的作用给予足够的重视。
    特点之二是，今年以来各地油田、油管、油轮、炼厂意外事故不断发生。如：3月底北美阿拉斯加油田漏油事件，英国北海油田继去年7月份平台爆炸事件之后，今年4月18日再次因管道漏气引起爆炸，苏联一次油气田爆炸事故致使460人丧生。此外，今年还发生过多起炼油厂和油轮爆炸以及沉船事件。这些事故无疑是偶然的，但均在不同程度上对市场产生着影响。同时，我们应从这一系列的偶然事件中看到其中包含着必然因素。这就是低油价使高成本油田的再生产遇到困难，油田设施维修费用的减少，使老油田的事故发生率明显增高。使得这类影响油价的偶然因素有可能变成经常性因素。
    特点之三是，非欧佩克石油产量开始下滑。1989年以来，非欧佩克原油产量下降3．2％，其中尤以美、英减产最为明显。美国产量降至760万桶／日，下降5.5％，国产油从占总消费量60％以上，降至55％，这是60年代以来的最低水平，且这一趋势仍在持续。英国北海油田产量减少70—80万桶／日。苏联一季度产量比去年同期下降2.5％，等等。非欧佩克石油生产的不景气给欧佩克重新扩大市场份额提供了有利的时机。
    特点之四是，欧佩克内部矛盾相对缓和。欧佩克第84、85届会议达成全部成员国参加的限产协议，尽管阿联酋、科威特对各自的配额水平很不满意，但毕竟还是同意参加协议，这比因战争而各不相让的两伊份额之争给欧佩克带来的威胁要小得多。这使欧佩克内部比前两年易于协调一致。目前石油市场供求矛盾缓解的形势使欧佩克相对地比较容易解决内部矛盾，而欧佩克内部分歧的缓和或减小又反过来使石油市场增加了稳定因素。
    特点之五是，今年上半年欧佩克产量和收入均有大幅增加。这与前几年有明显不同。1985年以前，欧佩克市场份额不断被挤占，石油收入逐年下降；1986年虽产量上升，市场份额增加，却因油价暴跌导致石油收入锐减；1987年油价回升，收入增加，但是市场份额再次有所下降；1988年市场份额增加，但因油价疲软收入不理想。而今年以来，欧佩克不但产量平均每日达2000万桶以上，由于油价坚挺，石油收入有大幅度增加。同时，因美元升值使欧佩克石油收入购买力大增，6个月以来，每一美元石油收入购买力提高11％，每卖出一桶原油可多购买三分之二的物品。因此，今年以来，欧佩克可以说是在产量份额和石油收入两个方面同时获得丰收。
    国际石油市场上出现的这些新特点，不仅对目前的油价上升起到了促进作用，而且对今后的石油市场无疑会产生大的影响。
