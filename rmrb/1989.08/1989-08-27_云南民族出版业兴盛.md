The ethnic publishing industry in Yunnan is thriving, characterized by a wide variety of languages and rich content. Various publishing units within the province have made serving ethnic minorities a priority. The Yunnan Nationalities Publishing House is the leading publisher of ethnic literature in China, capable of producing books in twelve different scripts, including Dehong Dai, Xishuangbanna Dai, Lisu, Wa, Lahu, Jingpo, and others. Over the past decade, the house has published 823 books, three times the number published in the twelve years before the Cultural Revolution. The house has released a series of books on ethnic folk literature and arts, as well as scholarly works like "China's Southwest and Southeast Asia's Cross-Border Ethnic Groups," which has been well-received by domestic and international academics.

The Dehong Nationalities Publishing House, located on the China-Myanmar border, is now able to publish books in five different scripts.

    云南民族出版业兴盛
    本报讯　记者袁晞报道：文种齐全、内容丰富是如今云南民族出版业的特点。省内各出版单位都把为少数民族服务列入议事日程。云南民族出版社是全国出版民族图书文种最多的出版社，能出德宏傣文、西双版纳傣文、傈僳文、佤文、拉祜文、景颇文等十二种文字的图书。十年间，这个社出书八百二十三种，是“文革”前十二年的三倍。该社出版了民族民间文艺作品的系列书；还出了具有较高学术价值的《中国西南与东南亚的跨境民族》，受到国内外学术界好评。
    地处中缅边界的德宏民族出版社，已能出版五个文种的图书。
