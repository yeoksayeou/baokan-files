Japan's government has decided to start lifting its advisory against travel to China, excluding Beijing, from tomorrow and to gradually resume various economic cooperation plans for this year. This was announced by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Director of Information, Watanabe, at a press conference today.

Watanabe stated that because Beijing is still under martial law, it is necessary to continue monitoring the security situation there, and the advisory against travel to Beijing will remain in place for the time being. Regarding the third yen loan and new economic cooperation plans for next year and beyond, these will be carefully studied in light of international developments.

The decision to advise Japanese citizens not to travel to China was made by the Japanese government in early June, and the implementation of economic cooperation plans was also suspended.

The Japanese tourism industry welcomed the government's measures, and various travel agencies have begun preparations to resume receiving tourists. In recent years, the number of Japanese tourists visiting China has increased by 10% each year, reaching 470,000 last year. According to statistics from the Japan Tourism Association, the number of people who canceled their travel plans to China after the government's advisory was issued reached 43,000 in June alone. A representative from the Japan Transport Company said that China is a very attractive destination for Japanese tourists. Looking ahead, there is still hope that the number of Japanese tourists visiting China this year will exceed 500,000.

    日决定逐步恢复对华合作计划
    本报东京8月17日电　记者于青报道：日本政府决定，从明天开始除北京以外，解除不要去中国旅行的劝告，逐步开始恢复年内各项经济合作计划。这是日本外务省外务报道官今天在记者会见中宣布的。
    渡边外务报道官说，因为北京还在实行戒严令，有必要继续注视北京的治安情况，暂不解除不要去北京的劝告。关于第三次日元贷款和明年以后新的经济合作计划，将视国际动向慎重研究。
    劝告日本人不要去中国的决定，是日本政府6月上旬作出的，经济合作计划的实施也随之停止。
    日本旅游业界对政府的措施表示欢迎，各旅游代理店已开始恢复接待游客的准备工作。近年日本赴华旅游人数每年递增10％，去年达47万人。据日本旅游业协会统计，自政府宣布劝告后，6月份内取消赴华旅游预约的人数达43000人。日本交通公司人士说，中国对日本旅游者是极有魅力的旅游地。从长远看，今年日本赴华旅游人数超过50万仍有希望。
