At 4:40 AM on July 10, the villagers of Shuangjiang Village, Group 8, Qujia Township, Hechuan County, Chongqing, will never forget this moment. A mudslide rushed down from the high clouds of Yunmen Mountain, and in an instant, 26 lives were mercilessly swallowed.

Communist Party member and provincial People's Congress representative Jing Shiquan heard the cries for help and rushed to the disaster-stricken Liujia Bay courtyard. All 74 houses were destroyed, leaving only piles of mud and stones. He pulled two people out of the mudslide, both lifeless. Amidst the lightning and thunder, Jing Shiquan suddenly saw a person hanging from a mulberry tree. He disregarded the mud up to his shoulders and rescued a survivor. Then, in the ruins and debris, he dug and pulled, managing to snatch 4 lives from the jaws of death. Under his leadership, the villagers rescued a total of 12 people.

On the evening of July 10, in the Municipal Committee meeting room, the Chongqing Municipal Committee held an emergency meeting on flood relief.

From early morning to evening, reports of disasters from Hechuan, Tongliang, Jiangbei... kept pouring in to Municipal Committee Secretary Xiao Yang, who was anxious. At the flood relief meeting, he announced: "From now on, I volunteer to take charge of the flood relief command center." He immediately issued two orders: first, to rescue people as quickly as possible, and second, for municipal and county leaders to take the lead.

A once-in-147-years heavy rainfall caused the rivers in Tongliang County to rise rapidly. Currently, 48 villagers from 7 villages and 5 communes in Nanguo Township are trapped on an "island" surrounded by floodwaters. Village Party Secretary Xia Qianzhen and Village Committee Director Xiao Shiren led 3 Communist Party members and 30 villagers, found small wooden boats, made rafts, and bravely headed towards the "island." Just as the 48 disaster victims, 50 million kilograms of grain, and other properties were transferred to a safe place, the rampaging floodwaters arrived, and the "island" disappeared!

In this flood disaster, 1,674 enterprises in Chongqing were affected, with Tianfu Mining Bureau being the hardest hit. On July 10, the transportation, communications, and water supply in the 100-mile mining area were completely cut off, and the mining area was in darkness. Many families were threatened by the floodwaters.

In times of crisis, Communist Party members stood out.

Lu Zhongcheng, soaked in water for 18 hours directing the repair of drainage pipes, his voice hoarse but still refusing to withdraw;

Huang Mingxiu, with water up to her waist at home, rushed to the air compressor room early in the morning, disregarding her family, and stood firm at her post;

Yang Xibing, while setting up water pipes, carried hundreds of pounds of pipes for others to repair...

The exemplary actions of the Communist Party members had a powerful appeal. The workers of Tianfu Mining Bureau stepped forward one after another. Worker Zheng Zhigang from Liujiagou Mine, upon discovering the disaster, together with the party members, first went door-to-door to wake up those still sleeping. A few households were trapped by the floodwaters, and he lifted the roof tiles to rescue others from the rooftops, while his own home was flooded.

The floodwaters gradually receded, but the image of the Communist Party members during the flood disaster remained etched in the hearts of millions of ordinary people. Along the riverside, people sang the praises of a village's 5 Communist Party members who, while rescuing the masses, went missing. A sincere voice rose from the hearts of the people: "Communist Party members, well done!"

    危难关头显本色
    ——记重庆抗洪救灾中的共产党员
    本报记者　陈华
    7月10日凌晨4时40分。重庆市合川县渠嘉乡双江村8组的村民永远不会忘记这一时刻。泥石流从高高的云门山头倾泻而下，顷刻间，26个生灵被无情地吞没了。
    共产党员、省人大代表荆世全听到呼救，奔到遭灾的刘家湾大院子。74间房屋全毁了，只有遍地的泥流石堆。他从泥石流中拉出了两个人，都断了气。电闪雷鸣中，荆世全突然看见一株桑树上挂着一个人。他不顾泥流没肩，救起了一个幸存者。接着，他在断壁残垣、烂泥乱石里掏着、抠着，硬是从死神手中夺回了4条生命。在他的带领下，村民们一共救出了12人。
    7月10日晚。在市委会议室，重庆市委召开抗洪救灾紧急会议。
    从凌晨到晚上，合川、铜梁、江北……一个又一个县的灾情不断传到市委书记肖秧的耳里，他心急如焚。在抗洪救灾会上，他宣布：“本人从现在起，自荐担任抗洪救灾指挥部指挥长。”随即下达了两条命令：一是赶紧救人，二是市县领导要打头阵。
    147年未遇的特大暴雨使铜梁县境内的河水陡涨，眼下南郭乡7村5社的48位村民正被洪水围困在一个“孤岛”上。村支书夏前正和村民委员会主任肖师伦带领3名共产党员和30个村民，找来小木船，扎好筏子，奋力向“孤岛”冲去。当48位灾民、5000万公斤粮食和其它财产刚转移到安全地带，肆虐的洪水到了，“孤岛”消逝了！
    在这次洪灾中，重庆有1674家企业受灾，天府矿务局是受灾最重的一个。7月10日那天，百里矿区的交通、通讯、供水全面中断，矿区一片漆黑。不少家庭面临洪水的威胁。
    危难时刻，共产党员站出来了。
    吕中成，浸泡在水中18个小时指挥抢修排水管道，嗓子哑了还坚持不撤离；
    黄明秀，家中的水淹到1米多深，可她一大早就赶到了压风机房，置家不顾，坚守岗位；
    杨细兵，在架设供水管道时，扛起上百斤重的水管让人抢修……
    共产党员们的模范行动具有强大的感召力。天府矿务局的工人纷纷挺身而出。刘家沟矿工人郑志刚发现灾情后，与党员一道首先挨门逐户的敲醒还在熟睡的人们。有几户被洪水封门了，他掀开屋瓦把别人从房顶救出，而他自己的家却被洪水淹没了。
    洪水渐渐消退了，可共产党员在洪灾中的形象却令千百万普通群众久久不能忘记。沿江两岸，人们传颂着一个村里5位共产党员为抢救群众至今下落不明的动人事迹。一个真诚的声音从人们心底发出：“共产党员，好样的！”
