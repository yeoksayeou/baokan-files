The leaders of the Jiedong District Committee in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, have demonstrated integrity and self-discipline in matters concerning their personal interests such as money, housing, and vehicles, earning praise from the public.

They let go of money. Since the 1985 wage reform, every time the district committee secretary and district head discussed salary adjustments, many people suggested using bonus points and flexible points to promote several leading cadres. These suggestions were all politely declined.

They let go of housing. In recent years, the district government has built four apartment buildings, distributing a total of over 180 units in two rounds. Although seven out of the eight committee members did not meet the housing standards at the time, not a single one requested a house.

They let go of vehicles. Usually, the committee members ride bicycles to and from work, strictly adhering to the rule of not using public vehicles for personal matters. Last year, the father of one committee member passed away in his hometown in Shandong. The funeral was urgent, and transportation was inconvenient. The district committee leaders suggested using a car to send him home. He insisted on not accepting, and finally took the train and a long-distance bus to return home for the funeral.

    石家庄市桥东区委领导廉洁自律
    让票子　让房子　让车子
    本报石家庄电　河北石家庄市桥东区区委领导干部，在涉及个人切身利益的票子、房子、车子问题上廉洁自律，受到群众称赞。
    让票子。1985年工资改革以来，区委书记、区长每次评议调资，都有不少人提议用奖励指标和机动指标给几位领导干部晋级，均被他们婉言谢绝。
    让房子。这几年，区机关先后盖起4栋宿舍楼，两次共分房180余套。8名常委尽管有7人当时住房未达标准，却无1人要房。
    让车子。平时，常委一律骑自行车上下班，坚持不用公车办私事。去年年底，一位常委的父亲在山东老家病故。丧期紧迫，交通不便。区委领导提议用汽车送他回家。他坚持不肯，最后坐火车转长途汽车回家奔丧。（陈国琦　群益）
