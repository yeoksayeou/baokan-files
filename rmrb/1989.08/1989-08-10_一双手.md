Title: A Pair of Hands

Throughout my life, I have shaken hands with countless people—old hands, young hands, dark hands, fair hands, rough hands, delicate hands, and even hands as soft and red as Tang Yuan's. But none of them left a deep impression.

In May 1988, the snow on the Xiaoxinganling Mountains had melted away, and the trees had opened their sleepy eyes. The people of the forestry area were shouldering their pickaxes and heading up the mountain to plant trees.

I went to the Wumahe Forestry Bureau in the mountains to conduct an interview. On the work site, I shook hands with a man. I dare say that no matter where I am in the future, if I shake hands with him again, I will immediately recognize it as Zhang Yingshan's hand.

Our meeting was like any other interview, with a polite handshake to start. In the instant our hands met, I was astonished: was this a hand? It felt like a piece of old pine wood!

I instinctively tried to pull my hand back, but I couldn't. His hand wrapped around mine like a thick quilt, holding it tightly.

I looked down to examine it. I turned it over to see the palm, and then the back of the hand.

The entire hand was the color of wood, with deep, rough lines stained with black soil. Clearly, he had washed his hands carefully with soap before our meeting.

The palm was as hard as leather, with calluses covering every corner. The fingers were thick and round. One finger looked like three segments of an old mushroom.

“Why do you wrap your knuckles with string?” I asked.

“To treat cracked hands,” Zhang Yingshan replied.

“Wouldn’t it be better to use bandages or hand cream?”

“Planting trees is manual labor. The roots and stones in the holes have to be picked out by hand. To ensure the seedlings don't get tangled, the roots have to be placed in the soil by hand. Planting one seedling requires sticking your hand into the soil three or four times. Bandages and hand cream won’t hold up.”

“How many trees can you plant in a day?”

“Over a thousand.”

Over a thousand trees a day! So, his hands would have to be inserted into the soil three or four thousand times a day! In ten days, twenty days... This pair of hands must be made of flesh and blood. If they were made of iron, they would surely be worn smooth and through.

“Wait a moment,” I said as I went into the inner room to get a measuring tape.

When I returned, he was still holding out his hand (in the same position as when we shook hands).

I measured his hand as if it were a piece of land: 24 centimeters long, 10 centimeters wide, 2.5 centimeters thick. This was the largest hand I had ever seen in my life.

After measuring, I rubbed my hand on his a few times. My hand felt like it was on fire, and when I looked, it was red. His hand remained the color of wood.

A responsible comrade from the forestry bureau's trade union introduced me, saying: “This pair of hands has planted over 260,000 trees. Between 1981 and 1985 alone, they planted 33 mu of forest, improved 44.5 mu of degraded forest and secondary forest, and produced 1,300 cubic meters of timber and 3,500 cubic meters of branches. This pair of hands has made this 32-year-old young forestry worker the youngest forestry hero in the Yichun forestry area, earning him the national 'May 1st' Labor Medal. The trees planted by this pair of hands have made the water in the Xibei River on the Xiaoxinganling Mountains clear. This is a pair of hands that have created a green treasury.”

Looking at this pair of hands, I heard the sound of trees falling and saw mountains of lush green forests... I vaguely realized: beauty comes at the cost of ugliness.

Yingshan's hands were large and thick, but his body was thin, not in proportion to this pair of large hands.

Perhaps the human body also follows the principle of distribution according to labor. The more the hands do, the more they naturally receive.

    一双手
    姜孟之
    今生我握过的手多得无其数——老手、嫩手、黑手、白手、粗手、细手，还有唐琬式的红酥手，但均不曾留下深印象。
    1988年5月份，小兴安岭上的雪化净了，树木睁开了惺忪的睡眼，林区人肩镐上山造林了。
    我去岭丘的乌马河林业局采访。在山场我握过一只手，我敢说，今后不论在什么地方，只要再握到它，就能马上说出，那是张迎善的手。
    我们见面和素常采访一样，礼节性地先握手。在两只手握到一起的一瞬间，我惊讶了：我握的是手吗？活像是半截老松木！
    我本能地想抽回手来，可是没能得逞。那只手似一条厚棉被，把我的手紧紧地裹住了。
    我低下头去察看。翻过来看手心，调过去看手背。
    整个手呈木色，手的纹络深、粗，染着黑土色。很明显，为了这次见面、握手，他事先用肥皂把这双手认真地洗过了。
    掌面鼓皮样硬，老茧布满每个角落，手指肥圆。一个手指似三节老甘蘑。
    左手大拇指没有指甲，长过指甲的地方，刻着四条形成上下两个“人”字形的黑且深的裂纹，手指各个关节缠着线，线染成了泥色。
    “指关节缠线做什么？”我问。
    “治手裂。”张迎善说。
    “手裂贴胶布涂手油多好？”
    “栽树是手活。穴里的草根根、石块块得用手拣出来。保证苗苗不窝根，苗根得用手送进土里。栽一棵苗，手得往土里插三四次。胶布手油不顶阵候。”
    “你一天能栽多少棵树？”
    “1000多棵。”
    一天栽1000多棵树！那么，他的手一天得往土里插三四千次！10天、20天呢？……这双手亏得是肉长的，若是铁铸的，怕也是磨光、磨透了。
    “你等着。”我边说边去里屋取来一圈米尺。
    我回来时，他仍在那伸着手（保持和我握手的姿势）。
    我丈量土地似的量起他的手来：长24厘米，宽10厘米，厚2.5厘米，这是我今生见到的天下第一号大手。
    量完，我用自己的手在他的手上“哗哗”搓了几个来回。我的手火燎燎地痛，看看，红了。他的手仍呈木色。
    林业局工会一位负责同志向我介绍说：“这双手已经栽树26万多棵。仅在1981至1985年间就造林33垧，改造迹地林和次生林44.5垧，这双手生产木材1300立方米，枝丫3500层积立方米。这双手让这位32岁的年轻林业工人，成为伊春林区最年轻的育林功臣，获得全国‘五一’劳动奖章。这双手栽的树使小兴安岭上的西北岔河水，由混变清。这是一双创建绿色金库的手。”
    看着这双手，我听到了“嘎嘎”的树倒声，看到了一山山的翠绿的森林……我隐约认识到：美，是以丑为代价的。
    迎善的手肥大，但身子单薄，和这双大手不成比例。
    人体内也在执行按劳分配制度吧，手做得多，得到的也自然多。
