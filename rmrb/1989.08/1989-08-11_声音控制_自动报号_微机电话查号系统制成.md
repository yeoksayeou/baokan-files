The first voice-controlled microcomputer telephone directory system in China has been successfully developed jointly by the Tangshan Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei Province and Tsinghua University. It recently passed the appraisal at a meeting attended by 18 units, including the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, and the Beijing Telecommunications Research Institute.

Experts unanimously agreed that this voice-controlled microcomputer directory system is at the forefront domestically in terms of voice recognition, voice synthesis, operation, and inquiry, and has reached the advanced international level of the 1980s.

The system uses voice input to query telephone numbers. After receiving the voice signal, it can prepare three user names and numbers in order of accuracy and display the first one on the screen. If the operator finds the displayed name correct, they can press the report number key, and the number will be automatically announced using voice synthesis. If the first display is incorrect, the operator can press the correction key, and the system will display the second prepared user name and telephone number.

According to the on-site appraisal test results, the accuracy rate of the first display reached 96%; for the first display errors, after pressing the correction key, the voice control accuracy rate reached 100%.

The system's ideal storage capacity for telephone numbers is 105,000. It can be used for "114" inquiry services in medium and small cities, as well as for "174" long-distance inquiry services in semi-automatic or fully automatic long-distance business offices. Operators no longer need to memorize a large number of numbers; they only need simple training to operate the system.

    声音控制　自动报号
    微机电话查号系统制成
    本报讯　我国第一套声控微机电话查号系统已由河北省唐山市邮电局和清华大学联合研制成功，最近在国家教委、邮电部、机械电子部、中国社会科学院、北京邮电学院和北京电信科研所等18个单位参加的鉴定会上通过鉴定。
    专家们一致认为，这种声控微机查号系统在语音识别、语音合成及操作、查询等方面，处于国内领先地位，达到80年代国际先进水平。
    该系统采用输入语音的方式进行电话号码查询。它接到语音信号后，可按准确程度依次准备3个用户名称及号码，并将第一个首先显示在屏幕上，话务员查看认为名称显示正确，可按报号键，号码则以语音合成方式自动报出。如第一个显示不对，话务员可按更正键，系统内准备的第二个用户名称及电话号码便显示出来。
    经现场鉴定测试结果，第一次显示准确率达到96％；对第一次显示有误的经按更正键以后，声控准确率达100％。
    该系统理想存贮电话号码容量为10.5万门，既可用于中小城市“114”台查询，又可用于具有半自动或全自动长途业务局的“174”长途查号台。话务员不用再背大量号码，只需经简单的训练便能操作。
