The funeral of Comrade Liang Hanbing, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China and a Marxist historian, was held today at the Baobing Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing.

Liang Hanbing passed away on August 9 due to illness at the age of 80.

Wreaths were sent by Yao Yilin, Hu Qiaomu, and the Organization Department and Propaganda Department of the Central Committee. Over 200 people from various circles, including Zhang Youyi, Nie Bichu, Ma Hong, and Liu Daye, attended the funeral.

Liang Hanbing joined the Communist Party of China in 1933. He had long been engaged in the Party's military work, united front work, and urban work, making selfless contributions to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people.

After the founding of New China, Liang Hanbing successively served as the Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee, the Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee and the President of Hebei University, the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in North China, the Secretary of the Party Group, Deputy Director, and Advisor of the Institute of Historical Research of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He made active contributions in the field of culture and education. During the "Cultural Revolution," Liang Hanbing was long persecuted by the "Gang of Four." He stood firm and clearly opposed the Lin Biao counter-revolutionary clique and the Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique.

As early as the 1930s, Liang Hanbing translated and published "Historical Materialism World History (Feudal Society)" and wrote "History of the Yin and Zhou Societies." After the liberation of the whole country, he persisted in studying Marxist theory and researching Chinese history and education issues. He edited and published works such as "Outline of Modern Revolutionary History in China," "Materialism and Idealism," "Chronicle of the War of Liberation," and "New Compilation of Local Chronicles Research." During the ten-year turmoil, he devoted himself to the study of Marxist historiography and compiled and published "Selected Works on the Theory of Historical Materialism." He also wrote "History of the Development of Chinese Society." After the "Gang of Four" was smashed, he actively promoted the restoration of the Chinese Historical Society and, at the age of 70, enthusiastically participated in the organization and leadership of the compilation of the "Great Dictionary of Chinese History." Through unremitting efforts, this massive historical reference work was published volume by volume. After 1980, Liang Hanbing participated in the organization and leadership of the compilation of new local chronicles nationwide, actively promoting the establishment of local chronicle institutions across the country.

Liang Hanbing, with unwavering dedication for decades, always prioritized the Party's cause, never mindful of personal status or gains and losses. He was diligent in his studies, hardworking, upright, open-minded, down-to-earth, brave in self-criticism, good at uniting comrades, and incorruptible. He was highly respected by many experts, scholars, and old comrades-in-arms.
