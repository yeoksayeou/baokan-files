Elders often worry that children, spoiled by indulgence, will grow up to be arrogant and incompetent "little suns." Fortunately, in Shanghai, a city known for setting trends, a group of "little suns" who navigate the maze of life has emerged—Shanghai's middle and primary school extracurricular science activities in a snapshot.

Newspaper reporters Wū Míngfēi and Liú Jūn

One day, Zhang Hong, a female student from Shanghai Normal University Affiliated High School, noticed unusual cloud formations and predicted, "In 10 days, there will be earthquakes in southeastern China and Japan." On the 11th day, Japan's central and western regions experienced 11 earthquakes. Four months later, she again predicted based on cloud patterns that Japan would experience another earthquake in 10 days. Nine days later, Japan indeed experienced a 6.2 magnitude earthquake. She smiled shyly. In the midst of the reform wave, Shanghai's middle and primary school students' extracurricular science activities have borne a series of enticing fruits.

Emerging from "Vague Nature"

These two students come from two different high schools but share a common trait—they are both playful.

Huáng Wénhuá grew up tending to insects. At the age of four or five, he would squat by the wall "helping" ants move. When he first entered Xiàngmíng Middle School, he would rush to the park to catch bees and butterflies as soon as school was over, resulting in poor grades and a house full of dragonflies, butterflies, and crickets. His parents sighed, "Oh, this child's soul has been taken by insects!"

However, his homeroom teacher saw potential and introduced him to the school's extracurricular biology interest group. Little Huang learned that "just catching insects isn't enough; you also need to learn to study them." He transitioned from a "vague nature" to a "clear interest." He combined his biology knowledge to conduct research on topics such as "Comparative Observation of Fruit Flies and House Flies," "Behavioral Study of Cats and White Mice Coexisting Peacefully," and "Research on Aphid Parasitic Wasp."

He was once again engrossed. The development period from egg to adult for fruit flies is one week, requiring samples to be taken every two hours to understand their growth patterns. During the day, Huang Wénhuá utilized class breaks to operate, and at night, he sat in the lab on a wicker chair, taking a nap every two hours to make slides, observe, and record, for an entire week without returning home. "A child enduring 7 days and 7 nights is truly amazing!" The nearly 60-year-old biology teacher, Gān Yìhuī, was moved to tears.

From junior high to senior high, Huang Wénhuá made over 400 insect specimens, wrote 9 biology essays, and won multiple city-level awards, becoming the president of the Shanghai Youth Insect Society. In Wuyi Mountain, he was praised as a "little entomologist" and discovered a new species of large insect—the 73mm long Zhōnghuá Chǐbèi Guō, which experts identified as a world-first discovery.

Zhuāng Wěidá, on the other hand, has always loved electronic products and would tinker with them whenever he had the chance. After entering the 67th Middle School, he was recommended to join the city's youth science station's electronics group, where he learned to assemble radios and tape recorders during his free time. "I want to learn to assemble TVs," he dreamed. From then on, he never missed the twice-weekly extracurricular assembly activities. With 200 resistors and over a thousand components, he memorized every detail. Under the guidance of his TV assembly group teacher, he quickly assembled his first black-and-white TV.

But he wasn't satisfied with that. During the summer vacation, he bought his own parts, tested them himself, and assembled another 12-inch TV. When the screen displayed a clear image, he excitedly carried the TV to the doorstep, calling out to his neighbors to come see his "masterpiece."

Meanwhile, the city and district-level youth science stations and some school science clubs have organized 160,000 middle school students and high-grade primary school students into various science groups, covering biology, mathematics, chemistry, electronics, aeromodeling, ship modeling, photography, computers, superconductivity, and dozens of other fields. Some children who love playing with small stones become "little rock collectors," and some "kite enthusiasts" become "little aeromodeling experts." Teachers, while delighted, concluded that when a child shows a keen interest in something, one should not scold them arbitrarily but rather guide them into the realm of science. Because interest and hobby are the greatest motivators for success.

A Black Umbrella Breaks the Mystery of Science

A black umbrella was found to have 26 flaws by a group of children:

"The umbrella's color is too monotonous, making it easy to grab the wrong one!"
"This umbrella blocks the view when facing the wind and rain, making it easy to collide with others."
"When folding the umbrella to get on a car, rainwater will drip onto others' pants or shoes. Can we install a water reservoir on the top?"
"At night, can we install a flashlight on the handle for walking with the umbrella?" ...

The above ideas from 70 students of Hétiánlù Primary School may seem naive, but their spirit of exploration is precious. "Science is right beside you," explained their teacher, Xià Zhōngzuò: "When you encounter inconveniences or dissatisfaction in life, you think of ways to improve them. This is also scientific invention!"

"Wow, science can be found right beside us!" The children listened attentively to their teacher. One day, a fifth-grader, Xú Chén, was doing homework at home when his younger brother played with an iron nail and inserted it into a live socket, causing him to collapse. His father scolded his brother when he returned. However, Xú Chén had an idea: "Children love playing with power outlets, which is very dangerous! Can we invent a shock-proof socket?" A year later, her "shock-proof socket" was born. At the World Youth Invention and Innovation Exhibition, where 31 countries participated, this invention won the "Best Work Award." This was the first time a Chinese youth won a gold medal for invention in the world.

Fāng Lí's creative inspiration came from the school basketball court. One cold winter day, Fāng Lí and her classmates were lined up at a basketball hoop, shivering. Fāng Lí suddenly had an idea: "Can we install multiple hoops on one basketball stand, allowing more students to practice?" Under the guidance of her teacher, she spent 14 months of effort to finally create a model of a "multi-use adjustable basketball stand" that can accommodate four people shooting at the same time. A vice-minister of the State Sports Commission remarked, "We have been wanting such a basketball stand for years, but it was a child who made it." Now, this basketball stand is being produced in factories.

Invention and innovation are one of the main contents of Shanghai's middle and primary school science activities. Small inventions from everyday life have greatly increased children's interest. In recent years, over 6,000 invention works by Shanghai's middle and primary school students have almost all come from daily life, such as Zhōu Lín's "automatic telephone recording machine" from Fùdàn Affiliated Middle School, Cài Huì's "home gas leak alarm" from Xiàngmíng Middle School, Lì Jìngdōng's "envelope sealing machine" and Bèi Mínggāng's "home rice cake cutting machine" from Fēnghuá Middle School ...

Children Stand at the Doorstep of Science

However, some parents began to worry: "Assembling a transistor, making small inventions, can children become smarter?"

"Through extracurricular science activities, children can consolidate the knowledge they have learned from books," answered Sū Wěihuá, a teacher from the city's youth science station's electronics group. "Some students find the electronics part of physics difficult, but by coming here to assemble radios and tape recorders, they remember many formulas and laws."

Experts once tracked 200 middle school students participating in science activities and were delighted to find that their comprehension and imagination abilities had increased by 30%, and their judgment abilities had also significantly improved.

A fifth-grader, Zhāng Jūn, became a "Shaolin fan" after watching the movie "Shaolin Temple," practicing martial arts all day, and his grades dropped. He eventually ran away to find Shaolin Temple. After being brought back, he saw his classmates making small inventions and was envious: "Teacher, my classmates all have invention ideas, but I don't!" "Your mind is full of weeds!" The teacher pressed his hand on his stomach. "You haven't learned your basic knowledge well, so you can't think of anything!" "Okay, I'll study hard from now on!" From then on, little Zhāng Jūn studied diligently. During the graduation exam, he scored an average of 96 in three main subjects and invented a small, portable "electric hair remover."

Even more delightful is that through science activities, children's hands have become more dexterous. Some children's manual abilities have increased by 60%. Some teachers said that some "little suns" have good academic performance but poor manual abilities, and once they enter life, they won't know how to do anything. However, those who have participated in science activities are generally more capable, and we don't need to worry about them!

Their creativity has also been enhanced through practice. Many children encounter difficulties or inconveniences in life and can think of ways to solve them themselves. This is in stark contrast to children who cry and make a fuss at the slightest difficulty. A sixth-grader, Zhèng Yīléi, lived with his family of four in a 12-square-meter room. They bought a three-seater sofa but couldn't fit a coffee table. The adults often sighed and complained, but the little one thought hard and invented a "three-seater sofa with a coffee table." When guests came, they placed the coffee table in the middle of the sofa, and when guests left, they could put it down and hang it on the wall.

The "little suns" have stood at the doorstep of science, receiving rigorous academic training and the spirit of perseverance. A middle school student participating in the meteorology interest group insisted on listening to weather broadcasts from various places at 5:15 AM every day and drawing simple weather maps. Once, a typhoon blew down a tree on the road, and heavy rain caused water to accumulate to a depth of one foot, but he still walked to school to record the weather. Such children, will they bow to difficulties in their future life journey?

    长辈们常常担心孩子们被宠坏了，将来会成为骄横而无能的“小太阳”。令人欣喜的是，在一向得风气之先的上海，涌出了一批——
    闯迷宫的“小太阳”
    ——上海中小学课外科技活动剪影
    新华社记者  邬鸣飞  刘军
    一次，上海师大附中女生张红发现天空云层异常，当即预报“10天后我国东南部以及日本将有地震”。第11天，日本中、西部连续发生了11次地震。时隔4月，她又根据云层预测10天后日本将再度地震。9天一过，日本果然又出现了6.2级地震。她腼腆地笑了。在改革大潮中应运而生的上海中小学生课外科技活动，居然结下了一连串诱人的硕果。
    走出“朦胧的天性”
    这两个孩子，来自两所中学，却有一个共同的特点——贪玩。
    黄文华是在侍弄昆虫中长大的。四五岁时，他就蹲在墙角边“帮助”蚂蚁搬家。刚进向明中学那阵，一放学便到公园采蜂扑蝶，结果成绩没上去，家里倒添了上千只蜻蜓、蝴蝶、蟋蟀。父母亲一个劲地叹气：“哎，这孩子的魂叫虫子勾去啦！”
    班主任却因势利导，把他介绍到校课余生物兴趣小组。小黄懂得了“光会捉虫子不算本事，还要学会研究”的道理，由“朦胧的天性”转向“明朗的兴趣”。他结合学习生物知识，先后开展了《果蝇和家蝇的对比观察》、《猫和白鼠“和平共处”行为考察》和《菜蚜茧蜂的研究》等课题的研究。
    他再次陶醉了。果蝇从卵到成虫的发育期为一周，要弄清其生长规律，必须每隔二小时取样一次。白天，黄文华利用课间操作，晚上他坐在实验室一张藤椅上打盹，两小时起来做一次涂片，观察、记录，整整一个星期没有回家。“一个孩子熬了7天7夜，真不容易呀！”年近花甲的生物老师甘忆晖心疼得差点掉泪。
    从初中到高中，黄文华自制了400多种昆虫标本，写了9篇生物学小论文，多次荣获市级奖励，并出任市青少年昆虫学会理事长。在武夷山，被誉为“小小昆虫家”的他，还采集到一种大型昆虫新种——73毫米长的中华齿背螽，经专家们鉴定，这在世界上属于首次发现。
    庄伟达则自小爱玩电子产品，一有空就拆拆弄弄。进了67中学，他被推荐参加市少年科技站的电子组，利用课余时间学会了装配收音机、录音机。“我还要学装电视机”。他有了新的梦幻。从此，每周两次的课外装机活动他从来不拉。一台电视机的200只电阻、上千个零件，在他那小脑袋里全记住了。在电视机组周老师的指导下，他很快装成了第一台黑白电视机。
    这还不过瘾。暑假里，他自己买零件，自己测试，又独自装了一台12英寸电视机。当荧屏上出现清晰的图象时，他高兴得把电视机抱到门口，大声招呼街坊邻居来看他的“杰作”。
    此间市、区两级少科站和一些学校科技俱乐部，共有16万中学生和小学高年级学生参加各科技小组，涉及生物、数学、化学、电子、航模、船模、摄影、计算机、超导等几十个领域。有的孩子爱玩小石头，结果成了“小矿石收藏家”，有的“风筝迷”成了“小航模专家”……老师们高兴之余得出这样的结论：当一个孩子对某一事物特别感兴趣时，不要随意训斥，看看能否以此为契机，引导他走进科学的殿堂。因为，兴趣和爱好是成才的最大动力。
    黑雨伞打破了科学神秘感
    一把黑色晴雨伞，竟被一群孩子找出了26个缺点：
    “伞布颜色太单调，放在一起容易拿错！”
    “这种伞挡迎面风雨时遮住了视线，容易撞到别人。”
    “收伞上车时，雨水会滴到别人的裤脚或鞋子里，能否在伞顶上装个储水器？”
    “雨夜打伞行走，能否在伞柄上装一只电筒？”……
    和田路小学70名学生的上述想法难免有天真之处，但这种探索精神很可贵。“科学就在你们身边”，指导教师夏钟作了通俗的解释：“你们在生活中碰到了不顺手、不称心、不满意的事情，你们想法子改进它，这也叫科学发明！”
    “哈，我们身边也找得到科学！”孩子们最听老师的话。一天，五年级学生徐琛在家做功课，弟弟玩耍时把一根铁钉插入带电的插座孔内，一下子被击倒在地。爸爸回来把弟弟狠狠骂了一顿。小徐琛的脑海里却闪出一个念头：“小孩喜欢玩电源插头，多危险哪！能不能发明一种防触电插座？”一年后，她的“防触电插座”诞生了。在有31个国家参展的世界青少年创造发明展览会上，这一发明荣获“最佳作品奖”。这是我国少年在世界上第一次获发明金牌。
    14岁的方黎的创造灵感，是在校篮球场上产生的。那是寒冬腊月的一天，方黎和同学们排着长队在一个篮球架下练球，冻得直哆嗦。方黎忽闪着大眼睛想开了：能否在一只篮球架上多装几只篮圈，这样不就可以让更多的同学练球了吗？在老师的指导下，她经过14个月的努力，终于制成同时可供4个人投篮的“多用升降篮球架”模型。国家体委一位副主任感慨地说：“我们多年来就想有这么一副篮球架，没想到被一个孩子搞出来了。”现在，这种篮球架已经在工厂投产。
    创造发明，是上海中小学科技活动的主要内容之一。身边触手可及的小发明使孩子们兴趣大增。几年来上海中小学生的6000多件发明作品，几乎都来自日常生活，比如复旦附中周林的“自动电话录音机”，向明中学蔡晖的“家用煤气泄漏报警器”，风华中学厉敬东的“信封封口机”和贝明纲的“家用切年糕机”……
    孩子们提前站到科学入口处
    然而一些家长开始忧心忡忡：“装个半导体，搞点小发明，孩子能变得聪明吗？”
    “通过课外科技活动，可以帮助孩子们巩固学到的书本知识”。市少科站电子组苏炜华老师这样作答：“有的学生感到物理的电子部分难，但到这儿来动手装一装收音机、录音机，许多公式、定律都记住了”。
    专家们曾对200名参加科技活动的中学生进行跟踪测定，欣喜地发现他们的理解能力和想象力分别提高了30％，判断能力也大大增强。
    小学五年级学生张军看了电影《少林寺》后，成了“少林迷”，整天“呀呀”地舞拳弄棒，成绩开“红灯”，最后干脆跑出去找少林寺了。小家伙被找回来后，看到同学们在搞小发明，很是羡慕：“老师，同学们都有发明的设想，我怎么没有？”“你这里全是草呀！”老师用手按着他的肚子说：“你的基础知识没学好，所以想不出来！”“那好，我今后保证好好学习！”从此，小张军发奋读书。毕业考试时，他三门主课平均96分，还发明了一个小巧玲珑的“电动拔毛机”。
    更可喜的是，孩子们通过科技活动，一双小手变得灵巧了。据测定，有些孩子的动手能力增强了60％。一些老师说，有的“小太阳”学习成绩好，但动手能力很差，一旦走向生活就什么也不会了，而参加过科技活动的一般都比较能干，不用我们担心！
    他们的创造意识也在实践中增强。许多孩子在生活中遇到困难或是不方便，能够自己想办法解决了。这与遇到一丁点困难就在大人面前撒娇甚至哭鼻子吵闹的孩子形成了鲜明的对照。六年级学生郑一雷全家4口人挤在一间12平方米的小屋里，买了三人沙发却搁不下茶几。大人们为此常常叹气、发牢骚，小家伙却冥思苦想，发明了“三人沙发连茶几”，客人来了把茶几安在沙发中间，客人走了可以放下挂到墙上。
    “小太阳”们提前站到了科学的入口处，接受着严谨的学风、锲而不舍拚搏精神的熏陶。一位参加气象兴趣小组的中学生，坚持每天凌晨五点一刻收听各地气象广播，画出简易气象图。有一次台风刮倒了马路上的大树，大雨使积水达一尺之深，但他仍步行到校做气象记录。这样的孩子，将来在人生的旅途上，难道还会向各种困难低头吗？
