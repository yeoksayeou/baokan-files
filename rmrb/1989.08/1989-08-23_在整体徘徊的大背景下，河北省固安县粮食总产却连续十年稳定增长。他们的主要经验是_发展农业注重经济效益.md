In the context of overall stagnation, the total grain production in Fixed County, Hebei Province, has steadily increased for ten consecutive years. Their main experience is to focus on economic benefits in agricultural development.

In recent years, while many places have been troubled by the stagnation and decline of grain production, Fixed County in Hebei Province has achieved a continuous 10-year increase in grain production at a rate of 9.1% for yield per unit area and 6.7% for total production. Last year, the total grain production reached 187 million kilograms, with a yield per unit area of 402 kilograms. Their experience shows that agricultural development should be market-oriented, adapt to local conditions, leverage strengths, and avoid weaknesses, and strive to maximize the economic benefits of land.

Seeking Benefits from the Market

Fixed County is located between Beijing and Tianjin, with relatively good land and water resources, and favorable market conditions. In 1985, based on extensive investigations and research, the county party committee and government, starting from the county's actual situation, first insisted on "two increases and three no reductions" in grain production: increasing grain yield per unit area and total production steadily; not reducing 450,000 mu of grain fields, 330,000 mu of wheat, and per capita grain possession of 500 kilograms. Secondly, facing the Beijing-Tianjin market, they fully leveraged the natural resource advantages of the locality, and made significant adjustments to the agricultural production layout, transforming from low-efficiency traditional agriculture to high-efficiency suburban agriculture. The county successively established five commercial bases for vegetables, fruits, and other products, significantly improving economic benefits. The annual output value of the five commercial bases reached 220 million yuan, accounting for 55% of the county's total agricultural income. Thirdly, facing the international market, they developed foreign exchange-earning agriculture. The formation of commercial bases and the development of foreign exchange-earning agriculture have driven the county's rural economy towards a path of pursuing benefits, with the agricultural commodity rate increasing from 53% to 72%, and the total agricultural output value rising from 200 million yuan in 1985 to 2.88 billion yuan in 1988.

Exploring Potential for Benefits

From the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee to 1985, Fixed County achieved six consecutive years of bumper grain harvests, with an annual increase of more than 7%. However, there were also issues of "three lows": low land output rate, low input-output ratio, and low agricultural labor productivity. Therefore, the county party committee and government decided to address these issues from two aspects. On one hand, they established a new accumulation and investment mechanism to strengthen agricultural infrastructure construction; on the other hand, they fully leveraged the power of science and technology. The input of science and technology brought high output. From 1985 to 1988, the grain production area in Fixed County decreased by 100,000 mu, but the total grain production increased by 69 million kilograms, and the output benefits significantly improved. Compared to 1985, the per mu land benefit increased by more than onefold, and farmers transformed from having income only in two seasons to having income in all four seasons.

Promoting Benefits through Services

Firstly, they developed cooperative organizations. All 16 townships and 421 natural villages in the county established economic cooperative societies, and more than 1,000 various specialized service organizations were established, including agricultural machinery, water and electricity, and information services. The establishment of various cooperative organizations reduced farmers' blind and repetitive purchases of agricultural machinery, improved the utilization rate of agricultural machinery, and lowered grain production costs. In 1987 alone, the county reduced repetitive purchases of agricultural machinery by 53.8 million yuan.

Secondly, the county's functional departments removed "interest barriers" and organized a "grand chorus" of socialized services. The county party committee and government required all functional departments to shift from competing with agriculture for benefits to benefiting agriculture and co-developing. Various functional departments, based on their own functional characteristics, worked around the economic interest community formed by production, supply, and marketing.

    在整体徘徊的大背景下，河北省固安县粮食总产却连续十年稳定增长。他们的主要经验是——
    发展农业注重经济效益
    薛伯昌
    近年来，在众多地方为粮食生产萎缩、停滞所困扰时，河北省固安县却连续10年以单产9.1％、总产6.7％的速度递增。去年粮食总产达1.87亿公斤，单产402公斤。他们的经验表明：发展农业要以市场为导向，因地制宜，扬长避短，尽可能提高土地的经济效益。
    向市场要效益
    固安县地处京津之间，土地和水利资源条件较好，市场条件也不错。1985年，县委、县政府在调查研究基础上，从县情出发，首先在粮食生产上，坚持
  “两提高、三不减”，即粮食单产、总产稳步提高；45万亩粮田不减，33万亩小麦不减，人均占有500公斤粮食不减。其次，面向京津市场，充分发挥本地的自然资源优势，对农业生产布局进行重大调整，由低效传统农业向高效城郊型农业转化。全县相继建起蔬菜、林果等5个商品基地，经济效益明显提高。5个商品基地年产值达2.2亿元，占全县农业总收入的55％。第三，面向国外市场，发展创汇农业。商品基地的形成和创汇农业的发展，使全县农村经济走向讲求效益的轨道，农业商品率由53％上升到72％，农业总产值由1985年的2亿元，猛增到1988年的2.88亿元。
    挖潜力求效益
    从党的十一届三中全会到1985年，固安县粮食生产连续6年丰收，年递增7％以上。但是，也存在“三不高”的问题，即土地产出率不高，投入效益不高，农业劳动生产率不高。因此，县委、县政府决定从两方面入手。一方面，建立新的积累投资机制，加强农业基础设施建设；另一方面，充分发挥科技的力量。科技投入带来了高产出，1985年到1988年固安县粮食面积减少了10万亩，粮食总产却增加了6900万公斤，而且产出效益显著提高。与1985年相比，亩耕地效益增长1倍多，农民由过去一年忙两秋，转变为四季有收入。
    靠服务促效益
    首先，他们发展合作组织，全县16个乡镇、421个自然村普遍建起经济联合社，并成立农机、水电流通、信息等各类专业服务组织千余个。各种合作组织的建立，减少了农民盲目重复购置农机具，提高了农机利用率，降低了粮食成本。仅1987年全县就减少重复购置农机具投资538万元。
    其次，县职能部门清除“利益障碍症”，组织社会化服务“大合唱”。县委、县政府要求各职能部门改与农争利为让利于农、共同发展。各职能部门根据本身职能特点，围绕由产供销各方结成经济利益共同体。
