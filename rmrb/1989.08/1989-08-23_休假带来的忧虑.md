    Worries Brought by Vacations
    Before traveling, the insurance broker from the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Turner, called his friends and colleagues to say, “I will be going abroad on vacation. I’ll see you when I return.” Little did he expect that his phone call had been tapped. Upon his return from vacation, he found his home had been ransacked. Every year from June to August is the peak vacation season for people in the Federal Republic of Germany. This year, approximately 100,000 families went on trips, providing thieves with ample opportunities. According to police statistics, a home is burglarized every three minutes across the country, with over 20,000 residential burglaries reported this year, resulting in economic losses exceeding 100 million Marks. Despite the police's best efforts, the clearance rate remains low.

    To prevent more families from suffering losses, home watch companies have emerged. Retirees, students, or those not traveling can sign up with these companies for temporary jobs. These temporary "watchers" not only help guard the homes but also manage the gardens, take care of the owners' dogs and cats, earning about 60 Marks per day. Additionally, radio and television stations repeatedly warn people before the vacation season begins: they should arrange with their relatives and friends to help watch over their homes, change to anti-theft locks, or install timers for lights to create the illusion that someone is home. A once-a-year vacation should be a joyful event, but it has brought worries to the people of the Federal Republic of Germany. Despite the government and residents' extensive anti-theft measures, burglaries remain difficult to prevent.

    休假带来的忧虑
    旅行之前，联邦德国保险经纪人特纳里法给朋友和同事打电话说：“我将到国外休假，回来后再见。”他万万没有想到，电话竟被人窃听了。他度假归来，发现家里被洗劫一空。每年六至八月，是联邦德国人的休假高峰期。今年约有十万个家庭外出旅行，这为梁上君子大开方便之门。据警方统计，全国每三分钟约有一所住宅被盗，民宅失窃案高达二万多起，经济损失今年已达一亿多马克。尽管警方作了很大努力，但破案率却很低。
    为了避免更多的家庭遭受损失，住宅看守公司应运而生。退休者、青年学生或不外出旅行者都可到公司报名求职。这些临时“看守”除了帮助看守住宅外，还管理花园，照料主人家的狗、猫，每天收入约六十马克。另外，广播、电视在度假期来临前也不断警告人们：应在旅行前同自己的亲朋好友说好，请他们帮助照看住宅，或换一把防盗锁，安装一盏能定时开关的灯，以造成屋内有人的假象。一年才一次的度假本是一件快乐之事，然而却给联邦德国人带来了忧虑。尽管官方和居民做了大量防盗工作，但依然防不胜防。
