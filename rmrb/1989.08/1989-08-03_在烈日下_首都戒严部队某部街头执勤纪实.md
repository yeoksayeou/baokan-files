In July, Beijing was scorched by the sun. The blazing sun felt like a fiery cauldron on one's head, making people restless. Young soldiers, wearing steel helmets and heavy leather boots, gripped their rifles and stood steadfastly under the scorching sun on the streets of the capital.

At noon, the sun's rays were at their most intense and scorching. The steel helmets became too hot to touch, with temperatures inside reaching over 40 degrees Celsius. Wearing them felt like being in a steamer, and the added weight of over three kilograms on their heads caused many soldiers to suffer from headaches. During the hottest part of the day, after just five minutes on duty, the soldiers' clothes would be soaked with sweat. The sweat would drip from under their helmets, down their cheeks and backs, and into their red leather boots. After an hour, everyone would be drenched in sweat, and their clothes would leave a white residue after drying.

This unit was responsible for several patrol points and nighttime patrols. Political Commissar Guo Chenggen told us, "In just over 20 days, 11 soldiers have fainted on duty." One day, a soldier from the 5th Company, Liu Xiang, stood guard on Chuwei Road under the blazing midday sun for over two hours without moving. The sun beat down like an electric heater, drying his body out. His lips were cracked, and he really wanted to step into the shade of a nearby tree... But when he saw the white banner on Chuwei Road that read "Six Martyrs' Spirits Live Forever," he tightened his grip on his rifle again... Finally, he collapsed from exhaustion at his post.

Soldier Cai Dong, who enlisted last year, held himself to high standards while on duty at Chuwei Road. He volunteered for the hottest shifts from 12 pm to 3 pm. Due to standing for extended periods, he felt dizzy and nauseous, eventually fainting and falling to the ground. His head hit the pavement, leaving a large bump. When he came to, he picked himself up, shouldered his rifle, and walked back to his post.

Platoon Leader Chen Jianliang from the 1st Company had developed foot rot from wearing heavy leather boots for extended periods. His toes and soles had rotted away, but he continued to treat his condition while on duty. From noon to 6 pm, the hottest part of the day, he stood at his post. Due to the swelling and pain in his feet and legs, walking was difficult. His fellow soldiers advised him to rest at home, but he refused, saying, "The entire battalion has over 230 people with foot rot, and 16 have severe cases. Some soldiers are worse off than me, but they still stand guard for seven or eight hours a day. Our platoon has few officers, and we can't be without a leader. I can't leave, but I can stand."

A heart full of love, a heart full of understanding. Our soldiers won the people's understanding and affection with their silent actions. The people sent tea, ice cream, soda, and watermelon to the soldiers on duty. There are countless such touching stories. Not long ago, one morning, Li Fuhong, an 84-year-old retired teacher from Beijing No. 40 Middle School, came with a neighbor's help to Gucheng Road and handed 1,000 yuan to Platoon Leader Li HuiPeng. She said, "You are standing guard in the sun for us. If you don't take it, I won't leave!" This old lady has no children and lives a very frugal life. This 1,000 yuan was saved over 10 years. Recently, the regiment's party committee sent a plaque to this old mother that read, "Patriotic Support for the Military, Deep Maternal Love."

    在烈日下
    ——首都戒严部队某部街头执勤纪实
    7月的北京，骄阳似火。火辣辣的太阳像顶在头上的火盆，使人焦躁不安。一个个年轻的战士头戴钢盔、脚穿翻毛皮鞋，紧握钢枪伫立在烈日下的首都街头。
    每到中午，是阳光最炽烈、最烫人的时刻，钢盔晒得烫手，里面的温度高达40多度，戴着像蒸笼，加上3斤多重的份量压在头上，战士们大都患有头痛病。天气最热的时候，上岗5分钟，战士身上的衣服就会湿透，汗水从钢盔下流出、顺着脸颊肩背流进战士脚下浅红色的翻毛皮鞋，一小时下来每个人都一身汗水，衣服干后留下一层白碱。
    这个部队担负着几个点的执勤站岗和夜间巡逻任务，政委郭成根向我们介绍说：“仅仅20多天以来，已有11名战士晕倒在岗位上。”一天，在翠微路站岗的5连战士刘祥，顶着中午的炎炎烈日，一站两个多小时，纹丝不动，阳光像电炉一样烤在身上，浑身就像晒干了似的，嘴唇干起了皮，他真想躲到身后的树荫下……但当他看到翠微路上“六烈士英灵永存”的白色横幅时，放松的双手又握紧了钢枪……最后，他终于因劳累过度晕倒在哨位上。
    去年入伍的战士蔡东，在翠微路执勤时，高标准要求自己，每次抢站12点到下午3点最热的一班，由于长时间站立，头昏目眩，恶心呕吐不止。终因劳累过度失去知觉摔到在马路上，头部摔起了大包。当他清醒后，撑起身挎起枪又朝哨位走去。
    一连排长陈建良因长期穿着翻毛皮鞋，患上了脚气，脚趾和脚板都已腐烂，但他一直坚持边治疗边执勤，每天中午到下午6点钟是最热的时候，他都在哨位上。由于脚腿肿疼，行走吃力，战士们劝他在家休息休息，但他坚决不同意：“全团已有230多人患了脚气，16人已腐烂，有的战士比我还厉害，但每天还要站岗七八个小时。咱们连干部少，不能没有带班的。我不能走，但能站”。
    一份情爱、一份理解。我们的战士用无声的行动赢得了人民的理解和爱戴。人民群众为执勤战士送茶水、买冰棍、递汽水、拿西瓜的动人事例数不胜数。……前不久的一天上午，北京40中的1959年退职的84岁高龄的女教师李傅红老大娘，在邻居的搀扶下来到古城路将1000元存款塞到带班排长李惠鹏手里。她说：“你们在太阳地里站岗，全都是为了我们啊，你们如果不收下，我就不走了！”这位老大娘无儿无女，生活相当节俭，这1000元是她用10年时间积攒起来的。最近，团党委向这位老妈妈送去了“爱国拥军，慈母情深”的大匾。
