On a summer night in 1987, on the steps of a church not far from New York's Central Station, a 19-year-old girl with a fair face shot herself with a handgun. The police recognized her as Savino, a well-known homeless youth who had long lived in Central Station. People lamented for a long time, sighing and discussing the true social causes of this tragedy. Only recently, American newspapers have fully revealed the details.

Savino came to New York Central Station at the age of 15, joining the 1.2 million-strong homeless youth group in America. Unlike other homeless youth, her parents were not poor. When Savino was very young, her parents divorced, and her mother opened a beauty salon in New York, which was doing well and could afford to send her and her brother to school.

At the age of 10, her brother, who was three years older, went to live with their father in California, leaving her alone with her mother, who was always busy and had little time to take care of her. Savino missed her brother and father very much, but since her father did not want to see her, her mother used the excuse that she did not have her father's phone number and could not get in touch with him to deceive and pacify her. Finally, under Savino's insistence, her father gave in and allowed her to stay with him for a week.

This week became a turning point in Savino's life. After returning to New York, she praised her father and stepmother for their warmth and hospitality, intending to provoke her mother. Mother and daughter began to quarrel and fight, eventually becoming uncontrollable. The mother had no choice but to send her to a mental hospital.

Thus, a 13-year-old girl began to shuttle between her family, mental hospitals, and boarding schools for sick children. She escaped multiple times and returned voluntarily. This went on for nearly three years. Finally, she escaped to New York Central Station.

Although Savino soon developed habits like drug abuse, she was always different from the others. She was always neat, warm-hearted, and honest, and never engaged in prostitution. From morning to night, she ran around the station, using various methods to encourage those who were downcast. When the charity organization's food truck arrived, she actively helped unload it and handed some of the food to sick children and the elderly. She carefully assisted the sick with their daily needs, feeding them water and food. When someone invited her to eat, she always remembered to save some of the good food to bring back to her unfortunate companions in the station. Here, she truly felt that there were people even more unfortunate than herself, who needed her care and love.

Savino's deeds were widely praised in Central Station. In the eyes of those weak patients, she was a "kind angel," while to those boys who always wanted to do bad things, she was a "strict disciplinarian." The station staff and police all knew her and had a good impression of her.

After Savino's death, many people claimed that they had tried to help Savino return to normal life, but all attempts failed due to various reasons. In fact, before her suicide, Savino had already become addicted to drugs and was unable to quit. Her body was also gradually weakening. People had long sensed that something tragic would happen to her. However, her family and society remained indifferent, watching this lovely girl step by step towards death.

The American media angrily questioned: Is it true that modern America has no power to save Savino's life? Why does the law allow a girl to destroy herself without any interference from the outside world?

    一个美国姑娘的悲剧
    1987年盛夏的一个夜晚，在离纽约中央火车站不远的一所教堂的台阶上，一个年仅19岁、面目清秀的姑娘用手枪自杀了。警察们认出来，她叫萨维诺，是长期住在中央火车站的那个颇有点名气的流浪儿。人们久久地惋惜着，哀叹着，谈论着造成这场悲剧的真正社会原因。前不久，美国报刊才对此作了全面披露。
    萨维诺15岁来到纽约中央火车站，加入了美国这支拥有120万人的庞大的流浪儿童队伍。与其它流浪儿不同，她的父母并不贫困。在萨维诺很小的时候，父母就离婚了，母亲在纽约开了一家美容院，生意不错，并有能力送她和哥哥去上学。
    10岁时，比她大3岁的哥哥去加利福尼亚与父亲同住，家中只剩下她和整天忙忙碌碌、很少有时间照顾她的母亲。萨维诺十分想念哥哥和父亲，但因父亲不想见到这个女儿，母亲只好以没有父亲的电话号码、无法取得联系为借口，加以欺骗应付。最后，在萨维诺的坚持下，父亲还是让了步，终于允许女儿到他那里住一个星期。
    这个星期成了萨维诺生活中的一个转折。回到纽约后，她成天夸奖父亲和后母对她热情相待，有意以此来刺激母亲。母女俩开始吵嘴、打架，一直发展到不可收拾的地步。母亲不得不把她送进精神病院。
    就这样，一个13岁的女孩开始在家庭、精神病院、收治病儿的寄宿学校之间进进出出。多次出逃，又主动返回。这样前后持续了将近3年，最后，她逃到了纽约中央火车站。
    尽管萨维诺很快染上了诸如吸毒一类的毛病，但她在火车站始终与众不同。她穿着整洁，为人热情、正直，从不卖淫。从早到晚她在车站上奔走，用各种办法为那些垂头丧气的人打气。慈善机构的食品车一到，她积极帮助卸车，并将一些食物送到生病的孩子和老人的手里。她细心地帮助病人起居，给他们喂水喂饭。遇到有人请她吃饭，她总忘不了把一些好吃的留下来，带给车站上不幸的同伴。在这里，她确确实实感受到，这个世界上还有比她更加不幸的人，他们需要她的关怀和爱。
    萨维诺的事迹在中央火车站广为传颂。在那些孱弱的病人眼里，她是一位“善良的天使”，而对那些总想干坏事的男孩子来说，她又是“管教严厉的野猫”。车站的职工和警察都认识她，并对她颇有好感。
    萨维诺死后，许多人声称他们曾经试图使萨维诺恢复正常生活，但都由于种种原因而没有成功。事实上，在自杀前，萨维诺已经吸毒成癖无法自拔，身体也日渐衰弱。人们早预感到在她身上将发生某种悲剧。但是家庭、社会还是熟视无睹，看着这个可爱的姑娘一步步走向死亡。
    美国舆论界愤怒地责问：难道现代美国就真的没有力量挽救萨维诺的生命吗？为什么法律允许一个女孩子毁灭自己而不受到任何来自外界的干涉？
