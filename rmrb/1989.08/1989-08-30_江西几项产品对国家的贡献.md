In 1988, the per capita grain production in Jiangxi was 427 kilograms, which was 65 kilograms more than the national average. From 1956 to 1988, Jiangxi annually exported an average of over 540,000 tons of grain (commercial grain), totaling 20 million tons over 36 years. On average, 25 train cars of grain were shipped out of the province daily.

Jiangxi has 2.5 billion cubic meters of standing timber, ranking second in East China, and 8.8 billion bamboo culms, ranking second in the country. Since the founding of the People's Republic, Jiangxi has annually exported approximately 1 million cubic meters of timber and 50 million bamboo culms.

Jiangxi has 28 types of mineral resources ranking in the top five nationally. Copper, silver, gold, tantalum, rubidium, cesium, and scandium are among the 11 mineral resources with the largest reserves in the country. Tungsten and tellurium are among the four mineral resources with the second-largest reserves in the country. The province's electrolytic copper production capacity accounts for one-fifth of the national total. Tungsten concentrate production accounts for more than half of the national total, primarily supplying national exports. Since liberation, it has earned the country $1.6 billion in foreign exchange.

Jiangxi's porcelain production, centered in Jingdezhen, provided 364 million pieces of export porcelain from 1985 to 1988, earning $102 million in foreign exchange, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total national porcelain exports during the same period.
