The implementation of paid use of homestead land in Linying County has led to over 7,000 households voluntarily returning excess occupied farmland.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, August 12th — (Reporters Gu Wenhong, Correspondent Gu Xuewen) Henan Province's Linying County has widely implemented the paid use of homestead land, leading to a new trend where cadres and the masses voluntarily return excess occupied homestead land and consciously save farmland.

In recent years, rural construction has surged, leading to an increasing trend of disorderly, excessive, and rushed occupation of homestead land. From 1982 to 1988, over 7 years, Linying County's rural construction used up 37,000 mu of farmland, accounting for 4.7% of the county's original farmland area.

To curb this trend, various levels of rural cadres have invested a large amount of time and energy, but with little effect.

Since this year, the county committee and county government, based on the experience of pilot projects, have decided to implement the paid use of homestead land across the county. According to the relevant regulations of the "Land Management Law" and the principle of linking homestead land with contracted responsibility land, the household's levy is divided into two parts, which are respectively borne by the contracted responsibility land and the homestead land. Each township and town, in combination with local conditions, formulates different standards for the use and payment of homestead land. For land within the standard, fees are collected annually to avoid increasing the burden on households; for excess land, it is legally recovered within a limited period, otherwise, the homestead levy is collected at double the rate.

Relevant parties believe that this method combines legal, economic, and administrative measures to manage homestead land, making it no longer profitable for those who originally occupied excess or disorderly land. So far, over 7,100 households in the county have voluntarily returned illegally occupied land, totaling more than 8,000 mu, and another 1,400 households have withdrawn their applications for homestead land.

These returned homestead lands, after unified planning by the collective, can ensure that farmers in the county will not occupy any more farmland for new homestead land allocation in the next 5-20 years.

    宅基地实行有偿使用
    临颍县七千多农户主动退出多占耕地
    新华社郑州8月12日电　（记者古文洪、通讯员谷学文）河南省临颍县普遍推行宅基地有偿使用办法，引来了干部群众纷纷退还多占宅基、自觉节约使用耕地的新气象。
    近年，农村建房成潮，随之乱占、多占、抢占宅基地现象日益突出。从1982年到1988年7年间，临颍县农村建房就用耕地3.7万亩，占全县原有耕地面积的4.7％。
    为抑制这种趋势，各级农村干部投入了大量的时间和精力，但实效不大。
    今年以来，县委、县政府在总结试点经验的基础上，决定在全县普遍推行宅基地有偿使用的办法，按照《土地管理法》有关规定和宅田挂钩的原则，将农户应交提留分为两半，分别由责任田和宅基地承担，各乡镇结合本地实际，制定不同的宅基使用和交费标准，对标准内的占地分年收费，尽量不增加农户负担；对多占的依法限期收回，否则加倍征收宅基提留款。
    有关方面认为，这种办法将法律、经济和行政手段结合起来管理宅基地，使那些原来多占或乱占地的户不得不扳着指头算算帐，多占宅基地不再合算。截至目前，全县已有7100多户农民主动退出非法占地，共计8000余亩，另有1400多户已申请宅基地的自觉撤回了申请。
    这些退还的宅基地经过集体统一规划，可以保证全县5—20年内农民新划宅基地不再占用一分耕地。
