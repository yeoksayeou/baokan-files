The Taiyang Lake embankment in our township has 1,500 mu of farmland, 1,200 mu of fish ponds, and a brick and tile factory with fixed assets of 480,000 yuan. The annual total industrial and agricultural output value of the embankment is 1 million yuan. However, it has also been a burden for the people. Since 1958, the people of the entire township have contributed over 1 million man-days of labor and raised over 800,000 yuan in funds. Every year, they carry soil, and every year, they spend money, but the embankments still collapse and the fields still flood. How to solve this problem? In 1987, Fang Xinguang, who had just been transferred to our township as the Party Secretary, went deep into the actual situation, visited cadres and the masses, inspected the embankments, and sought the opinions of the water conservancy department. He quickly made a decision to change the previous small-scale embankment heightening project into a comprehensive reinforcement and widening project to fundamentally solve the problem. After the project started, Fang Xinguang spent over 20 days on the construction site, guarding the lake slopes during the day and staying on the sandbanks at night. Under his leadership, the embankment reinforcement project was successfully completed. In recent years, the embankments have safely withstood the floods. The people of the entire township no longer have to worry about floods.

"The township government should work for the benefit of the people." In agricultural production, the people are most concerned about fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds. Regarding this, Fang Xinguang set a rule for himself and the township government cadres: no one is allowed to use their power for personal gain or to withhold even a single pound of fertilizer or a single ounce of pesticide from the people. He also announced at a meeting that he would accept the supervision of the people. This year, the township provided over 1,000 tons of agricultural fertilizers and 5,000 kilograms of pesticides, all of which were supplied to the farmers' households according to the plan. On June 10th of this year, during the hybrid late rice sowing season, someone suggested that the 10,000 kilograms of good seeds purchased from Zhanjiang by the township be sold at a higher price. However, Fang Xinguang said, "The township government is working for the benefit of the people. How can we, as officials, bear to make money from the farmers?" He insisted on supplying the seeds to the farmers' households at the original price.

    乘风乡党委书记的心思——
    急群众之所急
    我乡太阳湖堤垸，有农田1500亩，养鱼水面1200亩，还有一个固定资产48万元的砖瓦厂，垸内年工农业总产值100万元。可它又是群众一大负担。从1958年起，全乡群众先后投工100多万个，筹资80多万元，年年挑土，岁岁出钱，工用了，钱花了，还是三年两汛，堤溃垸渍。如何解决这个问题？1987年刚调来我乡任党委书记的方新群，就深入实际，走访干部群众，察看堤垸，征求水利部门的意见，很快作出决定，把往年小打小闹的堤坝加高工程改为加固加宽工程，彻底解决问题。工程上马后，方新群同志一头扎在工地上，日守湖坡，夜宿沙滩，一干就是20多天。在他的带领下，顺利完成了大堤加固工程。近几年堤垸都安全渡汛。全乡人民再也不用为水患发愁了。
    “乡政府要为群众谋利益”。农业生产中，群众最关心的是化肥、农药、种子。对此，方新群给自己和乡政府的干部们立下一条规矩：任何人不准以权谋私，克扣群众一斤化肥、一两农药。并在会上宣布，接受群众监督。今年全乡支农化肥1000多吨、农药5000公斤，全部按计划供应到农户手中。今年6月10日，正是杂交晚稻播种季节，乡里从湛江购进的1万公斤良种运回乡政府后，有人提出加价出售，可方新群同志说：“乡政府是为群众谋利益的，赚农民的钱，我们当干部的于心何忍？”他硬是主张按平价将种子供应到农户手中。
