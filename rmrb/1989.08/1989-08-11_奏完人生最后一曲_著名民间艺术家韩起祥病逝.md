Renowned folk artist Han Qixiang, who played the final tune of his life, passed away on August 6 at the age of 74. A memorial service for Comrade Han Qixiang was held on August 10 in Yan'an.

Han Qixiang was born in 1915 in Hengshan County, Shaanxi. He began his artistic career at the age of 13. After Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published, Han Qixiang became the first folk artist in China to perform and create new stories. He adhered to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, changing the outdated content of traditional folk performances. He created and performed new stories such as "Zhang Yulan Participates in the Election," "Wang Peiqin Travels South," and "The Heroic Fighter Liu Sihu." "Liu Qier's Reunion" is a representative work of the new female image in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, created after he went deep into the countryside of Huaixian County, Gansu.

After liberation, Han Qixiang did not stay in the big cities but rooted himself in the old revolutionary base areas of Shaanxi, using Yan'an's rural areas as his living base. He lived, worked, and labored with the peasant masses, creating numerous works such as "The Story of Liberation." After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, this elderly artist, over sixty years old, had even higher political enthusiasm. He walked with a cane, traversing mountains and rivers, going to the countryside to perform new stories, enthusiastically promoting the Party's line, policies, and new people and new events, and was praised as an artist of the people. Han Qixiang dedicated 60 years to the art of folk performances, creating 570 new stories totaling approximately 2.6 million words.

Before his passing, Han Qixiang was a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the China Quyi Artists Association.

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Office of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, the China Quyi Association, the China Blind Persons' Association, and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government and Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference sent condolences or wreaths. Several hundred people from various sectors of Yan'an attended the memorial service.
