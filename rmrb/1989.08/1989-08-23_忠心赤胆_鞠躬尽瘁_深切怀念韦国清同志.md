At midnight on June 14, 1989, the shocking news of the passing of Comrade Wei Guoqing, a loyal and tested Communist warrior, an outstanding military commander and political work leader of our army, a rare national leader of Zhuang ethnicity, and a revolutionary of the proletariat with remarkable leadership abilities, was suddenly announced. He left us without a will or any final words, but in his last moments, he was deeply concerned about the counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing in early June and was filled with unwavering confidence in the future of the Party and the Republic after the rebellion was suppressed.

Comrade Wei Guoqing was born into a poor peasant family in Donglan County, Guangxi. When he left school, the flames of the Great Revolution were rapidly spreading across the country, and the peasant movement in the Youjiang region of Guangxi was also developing rapidly. Under the influence of the democratic revolutionary ideology, he saw hope for the poor masses and the future of the Chinese nation, and thus harbored the desire to dedicate himself to the revolution. After the failure of the Great Revolution, his father, who initially served as the deputy head of the district peasant association and later joined the peasant self-defense army, was brutally killed by the reactionary authorities, and his family was destroyed. At the age of 14, Wei Guoqing, with a firm revolutionary conviction, joined the peasant movement and the armed struggle of the masses, becoming a member of the peasant self-defense army. In 1929, he joined the Communist Youth League of China, and in December of the same year, he participated in the famous Baise Uprising led by Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi, and was assigned to the Red Seventh Army. In February 1931, he joined the Communist Party of China.

Comrade Wei Guoqing, as a Communist warrior with lofty revolutionary ideals, is most admirable for his unwavering spirit and indomitable will in the face of adversity. He always resolutely executed the orders, instructions, and decisions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, and combined them with the actual struggle to complete tasks and open up new situations. In December 1934, after the Central Red Army entered Guizhou, the Party Central Committee held a Politburo meeting on New Year's Day 1935 on the south bank of the Wujiang River in Houjiang, once again rejecting the erroneous proposals of Bo Gu and issuing the "Decision on the New Action Guidelines After Crossing the River," reaffirming the already determined strategic tasks. According to the decision of the Party Central Committee, the Red Army immediately prepared to cross the Wujiang River. At that time, the task of building a pontoon bridge to cross the Wujiang River fell to the soldiers of the Special Operations Battalion of the Officer's Brigade. As the commander of the Special Operations Battalion, Comrade Wei Guoqing deeply felt that the success or failure of this task was crucial to the overall strategic operations. Without hesitation, he personally led the engineering battalion, under the direct command of Brigade Commander Chen Gong, to march 60 li overnight to the border crossing, organize the troops to overcome the shortages of materials, deep water, and rapid currents, cut bamboo, fell trees, and make bamboo rafts, and timely build the pontoon bridge to the other side of the Wujiang River, creating favorable conditions for the Central Red Army to quickly cross the Wujiang River and march straight to Zunyi.

During the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Wei Guoqing was transferred from the political commissar of the Ninth Brigade of the New Fourth Army to the brigade commander. In early December 1942, the Twenty-Sixth Regiment of the Ninth Brigade, after assisting the main forces outside the lines in eliminating the Japanese stronghold in Jinluo Town, moved to the Jujia Gang area of Suining County, Jiangsu. While the Japanese and puppet forces, totaling more than 1,000, were launching a surprise attack on Jujia Gang from Qingyang Town, Yanghe, and Guiren Town, the Twenty-Sixth Regiment, under the command of Comrade Wei Guoqing, fought bravely and repulsed the enemy's 10 attacks, finally defeating the enemy and achieving a significant victory in crushing the enemy's 30-day "mopping-up" operation in the Huaibei region.

Comrade Wei Guoqing had a broad vision and a deep understanding of the overall situation. He had a high degree of revolutionary self-awareness, always placing personal and local interests aside, and always prioritizing the overall interests. He consistently followed the Party's orders, ready to fight when called upon and to march when ordered, selflessly and fearlessly, always maintaining high revolutionary enthusiasm. During the War of Liberation, Comrade Wei Guoqing led his troops to carry out many diversionary and blocking tasks. He never complained but always prioritized the overall situation, observing the enemy's situation, seizing opportunities, and brilliantly completing the combat tasks assigned by his superiors. In February 1947, Comrade Wei Guoqing served as the commander and political commissar of the Second Column of the East China Field Army. To lure the enemy advancing from Xinan Town to Linyi to reinforce, in order to annihilate the reinforcing enemy, he was ordered to command his troops to annihilate the Nationalist Forty-Second Army. To avoid being detected by the enemy, he led his troops to march at night and hide during the day. On the night he received the order, he crossed the Longhai Railway, and on the second night, he circled behind the Nationalist Huang Baotou Corps and, in the Baita Pu area of Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, annihilated the Forty-Second Army headquarters and the Second and Fourth Divisions, capturing the army commander He Pengju. By the time the Huang Baotou Corps realized the attempt to reinforce, the Second Column, led by Comrade Wei Guoqing, had already completed the battle and returned to the north of the Longhai Railway. Subsequently, he led his troops to bypass Linyi, continuing the fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army, which was fearless of fatigue and hardship and capable of continuous combat, and immediately joined the Laiwu Campaign. In the same year, during the Menglianggu Campaign, Comrade Wei Guoqing led the Second Column and the Seventh Column to block the Nationalist Forty-Eighth and Eighty-Third Divisions at Qingtuosi. Facing the enemy's repeated frenzied attacks, he commanded with composure, with a fearless heroism to share the fate of the position, fighting the enemy for three days and nights, finally repelling the reinforcing enemy, and playing an important role in ensuring that the main attacking forces annihilated the elite Nationalist Seventy-Fourth Division.

In the short period of five months, he led his troops to launch a series of campaigns and battles, annihilating more than 20,000 enemy troops, effectively supporting the operations of our army in Shandong and the Central Plains, and further improving the war situation in the Huaihai region. In the Huaihai Campaign, which was unprecedented in scale and breadth, the troops under the command of Comrade Wei Guoqing mainly carried out the tasks of blocking and intercepting the enemy. It was only in the final stage of the campaign, when the Du Yuming group was encircled and annihilated, that they switched from blocking and intercepting to attacking as one of the three striking groups. For all these tasks, he always had a broad vision and resolutely executed the orders, leading the cadres and soldiers to bravely fight and achieve one victory after another.

Comrade Wei Guoqing was intelligent, flexible, brave, and good at fighting. He had both the fearless heroism and the meticulous strategies and insights. In the long-term military struggles, he was good at learning and applying Mao Zedong's military thoughts, making correct judgments and decisions through "thorough and necessary reconnaissance and the interconnected thinking of various reconnaissance materials," and timely and correctly deciding the deployment of combat, fighting battles with confidence. Therefore, the officers and soldiers who fought under his command all felt secure and at ease. Many old comrades affectionately called him "Little Zhaoge." During the War of Liberation, in the Huaihai Campaign, Comrade Wei Guoqing, in the first phase of the campaign to annihilate the Huang Baotou Corps, capture Suzhou, and isolate Xuzhou, led the Second Column, the Twelfth Column, the Eleventh Column of the Central Plains Field Army, and two artillery companies to carry out the task of flanking attack and threatening Xuzhou. From the start of the campaign to the end of the first phase, the situation on the battlefield changed rapidly. When he led his troops to the Longhai Railway, the Huang Baotou Corps fled west, and Generals He Jisheng and Zhang Keshu led more than 20,000 troops of the Nationalist Third Pacification Area to surrender, Comrade Wei Guoqing immediately changed the original deployment according to the changed situation, advancing from the middle of the two enemy forces stationed in Xinan Town to Alake and Haizhou, and then turning southwest, advancing from the south side of the Huang Baotou Corps. He led his troops, despite the fatigue of continuous pursuit and the shortage of food, to quickly advance towards the southeast of Xuzhou. When encountering the Nationalist One Hundred and Seventh Army on the way, he decisively commanded the troops to pursue and annihilate, forcing the army commander Sun Liangcheng and his headquarters and one division to surrender, and at the same time annihilating another fleeing division. Subsequently, he led his troops to threaten Xuzhou, blocking the escape route of the Huang Baotou Corps to Xuzhou, and organized four to five columns to attack the right wing of the Nationalist Qiu Qingquan Corps, tying down the strength of six divisions of the Qiu Corps, relieving the pressure on the frontline blocking forces; at the same time, coordinating with the Central Plains Field Army from the northeast to threaten the enemy in Bengbu, forcing the Nationalist Li Yan and Liu Yuming Corps not to dare to reinforce northward, ensuring that the main attacking forces annihilated the Huang Baotou Corps.

Comrade Wei Guoqing often said: A revolutionary should go where it is difficult. This simple and straightforward language vividly reflects his strong revolutionary will and noble political qualities. Comrade Wei Guoqing put his words into action. In the years of war, he was fearless of powerful enemies, unafraid of dangers, and worked hard to shoulder heavy responsibilities. In the winter of 1939, the Central Military Commission and the Eighth Route Army Headquarters ordered the First Division of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University to move from Jinzhong to the enemy-occupied areas of Shandong to establish a school. The leadership initially decided to appoint him as the principal of the First Division, but he considered that he had been engaged in school education work since before the Long March and requested the leadership to send him to the front line of the anti-Japanese war. In January 1940, Comrade Xu Xiangqian initially planned to assign him to a brigade in Jiaodong with better conditions and more personnel, but he repeatedly requested to go to a place with worse conditions and more hardships. Later, he was sent to the Luanhe Southward Advance Brigade, which was composed of several guerrilla units and had only a few hundred personnel, to serve as the political commissar. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the organization decided to transfer him to Beijing to engage in diplomatic work. He was preparing for this when the Vietnamese government requested that China send a military advisory group to Vietnam. In 1950, the Chinese government decided to appoint Comrade Wei Guoqing as the head of the military advisory group. He immediately packed his bags and, without hesitation, left the comfortable peace and did not consider the level of his personal position, and resolutely led the Chinese military advisory group to the jungles of Vietnam. For this, he was personally praised by Chairman Mao Zedong. In the same year, under the direct leadership of Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, he participated in the organization of the border campaign, smashing the entire defensive system of the French army from Cao Bang to Lang Son, turning the situation on the northern battlefield of Vietnam. Later, Comrade Wei Guoqing led the military advisory group to assist the Vietnamese People's Army in organizing a series of campaigns such as Trung Bo, Dong Bac, Ninh Binh, Tay Bac, and Thua Thien. In 1954, despite his illness, he, with his indomitable revolutionary will, made outstanding contributions in participating in the command of the Dien Bien Phu Campaign, which was decisive to the victory of the Vietnamese anti-French war.

During his time in the military, Comrade Wei Guoqing always resolutely implemented Mao Zedong's military thoughts, emphasized the inheritance and development of the excellent traditions of our Party and army, always attached great importance to the position and role of political work in the army, and accumulated rich political work experience, demonstrating outstanding political work leadership abilities. In the spring of 1940, Comrade Wei Guoqing was transferred to the Second Route Army Luanhe Southward Advance Brigade. This brigade was a newly established local guerrilla unit in December 1938. With the development of the situation, the Southward Advance Brigade was successively reorganized into the Third Brigade of the Eighth Route Army Fifth Column and the Ninth Brigade of the New Fourth Army Third Division. Comrade Wei Guoqing served as the political commissar all along. In 1941, the CPC Central Committee Huabei Bureau and the New Fourth Army Headquarters issued a call to build the New Fourth Army into a regular party army. Comrade Wei Guoqing, in accordance with the Party's military policies, combined the specific situation of the troops, correctly implemented the Party's cadre policies, united all cadres, strengthened the construction of grassroots party organizations and ideological work of the troops, and gave full play to the role of a few Red Army cadres, making all officers and soldiers work together to continuously improve their combat effectiveness, thus making this revolutionary force, which was established after the start of the war of resistance, into a model of hard struggle in a short period of time. In the spring of 1942, Liu Shaoqi, then secretary of the CPC Central Committee Huabei Bureau, mentioned at the first enlarged meeting of the Huabei Bureau that "the Ninth Brigade is one of the best-performing newly established units in Huabei after the war of resistance. It has become part of a regular party army and has created some excellent styles, improved combat effectiveness, and achieved considerable results in the work of opening up and restoring the Huabei and Subei base areas." This naturally included the efforts and dedication of the political commissar of the Ninth Brigade, Comrade Wei Guoqing. From 1977 to 1982, Comrade Wei Guoqing served as the director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, leading the political work of the entire army. Due to the internal turmoil of the "Cultural Revolution" and the long-term interference and sabotage of Lin Biao in the construction of the army, the ideological and political work of the troops, like the entire situation of the country, was seriously damaged, and many difficult problems were accumulated. In these five years, Comrade Wei Guoqing went deep into the troops and border defense islands, conducted extensive investigations and research, and based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, especially the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the direct guidance of Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping, inherited the excellent traditions of the army's political work since the Gutian Conference, summarized the positive and negative experiences of the army's ideological and political work in the struggle against the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques, analyzed the new situation of the army, and made many important decisions and policies to quickly correct the harm caused by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques to the construction of the troops, eliminate the influence of the "Left," rectify the wrongs, restore and carry forward the excellent traditions of the army, and oppose bourgeois liberalization. He organized and presided over four full military political work conferences, organized the high-level political work cadres of the entire army to study and discuss a series of major issues at the full military political work conference, such as how to carry out political work under new historical conditions to ensure the improvement of the troops' combat effectiveness; how to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the troops, adhere to the four cardinal principles, improve the awareness of implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies, ensure that the troops maintain political unity with the Party Central Committee, carry forward the revolutionary spirit, and build socialist spiritual civilization; how to build a cadre team that is revolutionary, knowledgeable, specialized, and young, strengthen grassroots construction, rectify the ideological style of various levels of party committees and organs, and so on. In May 1978, Comrade Wei Guoqing gave a report at the full military political work conference, emphasizing how to do political work under new historical conditions to truly ensure the improvement of the troops' combat effectiveness. He pointed out that improving political awareness is combat effectiveness, practicing tactics and techniques is combat effectiveness, good style is combat effectiveness, strict discipline is combat effectiveness, unity between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people is combat effectiveness, and improving the organizational command capabilities of cadres and the scientific and cultural knowledge of the troops is also combat effectiveness. How political work can play a role in all aspects, cultivate and improve the troops' combat effectiveness in peacetime is a new and important issue that must be solved. Comrade Wei Guoqing made important contributions to eliminating the poison and influence of the "Left," rectifying the wrongs, maintaining the Party's absolute leadership over the army, inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions of the army's political work, opposing bourgeois liberalization, comprehensively rectifying the troops, promoting the construction of the troops' spiritual civilization, and accelerating the revolutionary, modern, and regular construction of the troops.

Comrade Wei Guoqing was a person of broad-mindedness and integrity, always firmly implementing the Party's cadre policies and insisting on a broad-minded approach, never forming personal cliques. When he went to Guangxi, he only took one bodyguard with him. When he was transferred to the General Political Department, he only had one more secretary. Even in the midst of the ten years of turmoil, such a difficult and complex situation, he could get out of the whirlpool of personal grudges and treat the masses and cadres equally. Comrade Wei Guoqing was principled, strict with himself, honest, and selfless throughout his life. Whether in the years of war or in the period of peaceful construction, he never sought personal, familial, or staff privileges. He did not touch any of the spoils of war. When inspecting the troops, he never allowed extra dishes. In Vietnam, he suffered from gastric ulcers but did not ask for any special treatment, only relying on congee to support his body. He returned new products from local enterprises after inspection and did not allow them to be kept for personal use under the pretext of trial use. In 1977, after he took office as the director of the General Political Department, some comrades wanted to transfer one of his children into the army. Knowing this, he immediately stopped it. His two younger brothers are still farming in the countryside. During his inspections, he not only contacted cadres above the regiment level but also directly held meetings with company and platoon cadres, and was not bound by formalities. In his work at the General Political Department, he tried not to use the method of drawing circles but to use the form of office meetings to study and solve problems. In implementing the high-level cadre living standards, he immediately handed in the items that needed to be returned. From these ordinary things, we can see his noble character as a clean and selfless Communist.

Comrade Wei Guoqing's firm belief in communism, indomitable revolutionary will, noble character, and excellent qualities will forever be etched in our hearts. His revolutionary achievements will be forever recorded in history!

    忠心赤胆　鞠躬尽瘁
    ——深切怀念韦国清同志
    解放军总政治部
    1989年6月14日凌晨零点29分，猝然传来令人悲痛的噩耗，我党久经考验的忠诚的共产主义战士、我军杰出的军事指挥员和政治工作领导者、共和国少有的壮族出身的国家领导人、具有突出领导才能的无产阶级革命家——韦国清同志离我们而去了。
    没有遗嘱，没有留言，唯有在生命的最后时刻，还怀着对6月初发生在北京地区的反革命暴乱的极大关注；对平息暴乱后党与共和国的前途充满必胜的信心……
    国清同志出生于广西东兰县壮族一个贫苦农民的家庭。他走出小学校门时，正逢大革命的烽火迅猛燃向全国，广西右江地区的农民运动亦得到迅速发展。在民主革命思潮的耳濡目染下，他看到了穷苦大众的希望，中华民族的未来，从而萌生了献身革命的意愿。大革命失败后，他那最初担任区农民协会副会长，后又参加农民自卫军的父亲，惨遭反动当局杀害，家庭亦被摧残，于是，还不满15周岁的国清同志，以坚定的革命信念，毅然投入农民运动和群众武装斗争，成了农民自卫军的一员。1929年他加入中国共产主义青年团，同年12月参加了由邓小平、张云逸等同志领导的著名的百色起义，并被编入红七军。1931年2月转入中国共产党。
    国清同志作为一名胸怀崇高革命理想的共产主义战士，最令人敬佩的是：无论处于何种艰难困苦的情况，都能以顽强不屈、百折不挠的精神，坚决执行党中央、中央军委的命令、指示和决定，并结合斗争实际，努力完成任务，开拓局面。1934年12月，中央红军长征进入贵州后，党中央于1935年元旦这一天，在乌江南岸的猴场召开政治局会议，又一次否定了博古的错误主张，作出《关于渡江后新的行动方针的决定》，重申已确定的战略任务。按照党中央的决定，红军立即准备越过乌江。当时，为强渡乌江架设浮桥的任务，落在了干部团特科营工兵连官兵的肩上。担任特科营营长的国清同志，深感这一任务能否胜利完成，对全局战略行动至关重大。他毫不犹豫地亲自带领工兵连，在团长陈赓同志的直接领导下，星夜急行军60里，赶到边界渡口，组织部队克服器材短缺、水深流急等种种困难，砍竹、伐木，扎竹排，及时把浮桥架到乌江对岸，为中央红军迅速跨越乌江、直下遵义创造了有利条件。抗日战争进入相持阶段后期，国清同志由新四军九旅政委改任旅长。1942年12月上旬，九旅第二十六团在配合外线主力拔除金锁镇日军据点后，即转移到江苏泗洪县朱家岗地区。而日伪军1000余人，也由青阳镇、洋河、归仁集成三路偷袭朱家岗。二十六团在国清同志的指挥下，全体指战员沉着应战，先后打退敌10次冲锋，终将敌击溃，取得了粉碎日伪军对淮北地区30余天“大扫荡”这一具有重大意义的胜利。
    国清同志识大体，顾大局，具有把个人和局部利益置之度外，时时事事处处以全局利益为重的高度的革命自觉性，言行一致地做到了一切听从党调遣，叫打就打，叫走就走，无私无畏，始终保持着高昂的革命热情。解放战争时期，国清同志率部担负了许多牵制、阻击任务。他从无怨言，总是以大局为重，纵观战役敌我势态，审时度势，捕捉战机，出色地完成了上级交给的战斗任务。1947年2月，国清同志时任华东野战军二纵队司令员兼政委。为诱使从新安镇进犯临沂之敌东援，以便寻歼援敌，他奉命指挥所部歼灭国民党第四十二集团军。为了不被敌察觉，他率部夜行昼伏。在接到命令当晚越过陇海铁路，第二夜又绕到国民党黄百韬兵团后面，在江苏省东海县白塔埠地区，一举歼灭四十二集团军总部和第二、第四师，活捉了该集团军司令郝鹏举，待黄百韬兵团发觉企图增援时，国清同志率二纵队已胜利结束战斗，返回陇海铁路以北。随后，他又率部绕过临沂，发扬我军不怕疲劳、不畏艰苦、连续作战的战斗作风，立即投入莱芜战役。同年在孟良崮战役中，国清同志率二纵队与第七纵队在青驼寺担任阻击国民党第四十八、第八十三师的任务。面对敌人的多次疯狂进攻，他指挥若定，以与阵地共存亡的大无畏的英雄气概，与敌血战三昼夜，终于将援敌打退，对保证主攻部队全歼国民党军精锐部队整编第七十四师起了重要作用。1948年解放战争即将转入全面反攻阶段前，国清同志调任苏北兵团司令员，率部由山东胶县以南地区南下，独当一面，担负苏北战场的作战、执行吸引山东部分敌军南下和策应中原我军作战的任务。在短短5个月中，他率部连续发起了益林、盐（城）南、陇海路东段、众兴（泗阳）、涟水等战役、战斗，共歼敌两万余人，有力地策应了我军山东、中原战场的作战，进一步改善了华中地区的战争形势。在规模空前、战场广阔的淮海战役中，国清同志指挥的部队，主要也是执行打援、阻援的作战任务，只是在战役的最后阶段——围歼杜聿明集团时，才由牵制、阻击转为攻击的三个突击集团之一。对于这一切，他都是胸怀全局，坚决执行命令，率领干部战士英勇奋战，夺取了一个又一个胜利。
    国清同志机智灵活、英勇善战，既有大无畏的英雄气概，又有缜密善断的谋略与卓识。在长期的军事斗争中，他善于学习、运用毛泽东军事思想，通过“周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索”，作出正确的判断和下定正确的决心，适时地、正确地去决定作战部署，打有把握的仗。因而跟随他作战的指战员们，都感到心里踏实、放心。不少老同志都亲切地称他为“小诸葛”。解放战争中，国清同志在淮海战役歼灭黄百韬兵团、攻占宿县、孤立徐州的第一阶段作战中，率二纵队、十二纵队、中原野战军十一纵队和两个炮兵连，执行侧翼打援、威逼徐州的作战任务。从整个战役发起至战役的第一阶段结束，整整半个月的时间，战场的情况瞬息万变。当他率部进抵陇海铁路后，出现了黄百韬兵团西逃，何基沣、张克侠两将军率国民党第三绥靖区2万余人起义的新情况，国清同志即依据变化了的情况，改变了原来的部署，由从驻守新安镇至阿湖地区、海州地区两敌中间挺进楔入，后转向西南，从黄百韬兵团南侧向前赶超。他率部不顾连日奔袭的疲劳和缺粮的困难，向徐州东南方向疾进，在途中与国民党军第一○七军遭遇时，他果断指挥部队进行追击、围歼，迫使该军军长孙良诚率军部和一个师投诚，同时歼灭了窜逃的另一个师。随后率部抵近威胁徐州，挡住了黄百韬兵团逃向徐州的退路，并两次组织四至五个纵队并列猛攻国民党军邱清泉兵团右翼，牵制邱兵团六个师的兵力，减轻了正面阻援部队的压力；同时与中原野战军互相呼应，从东北方面威胁蚌埠之敌，迫使国民党军李延年、刘汝明两个兵团不敢放胆向北增援，保障了主攻部队歼灭黄百韬兵团。
    国清同志常说：一个革命者应该哪里艰苦就到哪里去。这简明朴素的语言，鲜明地反映了他坚强的革命意志和崇高的政治品质。国清同志说到做到。在战争年代，他不畏强敌、不避艰险、艰苦奋斗、勇挑重担。1939年冬，中央军委和八路军总部命令抗大一分校由晋东南深入到山东敌后办学。总部领导最初曾决定让他任一分校的校长，但他考虑到自己从长征前就开始从事学校教育工作，请求总部领导将他派至抗日最前线。1940年1月，徐向前同志原先准备分配他到胶东一个条件比较好、人数比较多的支队去，但他再三要求到条件比较差和艰苦的地方去，后来不得不把他派到由数支游击队组建才一年多、人数只几百人的陇海南进支队去任政委。中华人民共和国成立后，组织上曾决定将他调至北京，从事外交工作。他正在着手进行准备时，越南政府向我国政府提出派军事顾问团赴越南的要求。1950年，我国政府决定指派国清同志担任军事顾问团的团长，他立即打点行装，毫不留恋舒适的和平生活、毫不考虑个人职务的高低，从硝烟才散、炮声刚停的战场上又坚毅地率领中国军事顾问团走向越南的丛林。为此，他受到了毛泽东主席的亲口表扬。同年，在越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的直接领导下，他参与组织了边界战役，粉碎了法军从高平至谅山一线的全部防御体系，扭转了越南北部战场的战局。以后，国清同志率军事顾问团又协助越南人民军组织了中游、东北、宁平、西北、上寮等一系列战役。1954年他不顾病痛，以顽强的革命意志，在参加指挥对越南抗法战争胜利具有决定意义的奠边府战役中，做出了卓越的贡献。
    国清同志在军队工作期间，始终坚决贯彻执行毛泽东的建军思想，注重继承和发扬我党我军的优良传统，一贯重视我军政治工作的地位和作用，并且积累了丰富的政治工作经验，表现出了突出的政治工作领导才能。1940年春，国清同志调至二路军陇海南进支队。该支队是于1938年12月新组建的地方游击部队。随着形势的发展，南进支队又先后编为八路军五纵队三支队、新四军三师九旅。国清同志则一直担任政委职务。1941年中共中央华中局和新四军军部发出将新四军部队建设成为正规化党军的号召。国清同志按照党的建军方针、政策，有针对性地结合部队具体情况，正确执行党的干部政策，团结全体干部，抓好部队党的基层组织和思想工作建设，并发挥仅有的少数红军骨干的作用，使全体指战员同心同德不断提高自身战斗力，从而使这支抗战开始后才组建起来的革命队伍，在不长的时间里，就锻炼成为一支“在全军（新四军）来讲，艰苦奋斗精神堪称模范”的部队，1942年春，当时任中共中央华中局书记的刘少奇同志在华中局第一次扩大会议上，曾提到“九旅是华中抗战后，新成立部队中之成绩较优者，它已经成为正规化党军之一部，并创造了一些优良作风，战斗力提高了，它在开辟和恢复皖东北和苏北根据地工作中，有相当大的成绩。”这自然包含了九旅政委国清同志所作出的努力和付出的心血。1977年至1982年，国清同志出任人民解放军总政治部主任，主持领导全军政治工作。由于“文化大革命”的内乱和林彪长期对军队建设的干扰、破坏，部队的思想政治工作和整个国家的情况一样，受到严重的损害，积存着不少难题。在这5年的时间里，国清同志深入部队、边防海岛，在广泛调查研究的基础上，根据党中央、中央军委的指示，特别是党的十一届三中全会的精神，在军委主席邓小平的直接指导下，继承古田会议以来我军政治工作的优良传统，总结同林彪、江青反革命集团斗争中，我军思想政治工作的正反两方面的经验，分析了我军新的情况，就迅速纠正林彪、江青反革命集团对部队建设造成的危害，肃清“左”的影响，拨乱反正，平反冤假错案，恢复和发扬我军的优良传统，作出了不少重要决定，制定了许多重要政策，并处理了大量棘手的问题。他先后组织召开了4次全军政治工作会议，组织全军政治工作高级领导干部在全军政工会议上，先后着重研究、讨论了新的历史条件下军队政治工作建设的问题；政治工作如何围绕以加强党的建设为中心，带动现代化革命军队建设各个方面工作的问题；军队加强政治思想领导，坚持四项基本原则，提高贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策的自觉性，保证部队在政治上同党中央保持一致和发扬革命精神，建设社会主义精神文明的问题；建设革命化、知识化、专业化、年轻化的干部队伍，加强基层建设，整顿各级党委和机关的思想作风等一系列重大问题。1978年5月，国清同志在全军政工会议上作报告，着重阐述了新的历史条件下，怎样做好政治工作，真正保证部队战斗力提高的问题。他明确指出，提高政治觉悟出战斗力，苦练战术技术出战斗力，优良作风出战斗力，严格纪律出战斗力，官兵团结，军民团结出战斗力，提高干部的组织指挥能力和部队的科学文化知识也是战斗力。政治工作如何从各方面发挥作用，平时培养和提高部队战斗力，这是一个新的重要问题，也是必须解决的问题。国清同志为肃清“左”的流毒、影响，拨乱反正，维护党对军队的绝对领导，继承发扬我军政治工作优良传统，反对资产阶级自由化，全面整顿部队、促进部队精神文明建设，加速部队的革命化、现代化、正规化建设，作出了重要贡献。
    国清同志为人胸怀坦荡，光明磊落，无论走到哪里都坚决执行党的干部政策，坚持搞五湖四海，从不搞个人的小圈子。到广西时，他随身只带了一名警卫人员，调至总政治部时，跟随他的仅多了一位秘书而已。即使处在十年动乱，那样困难、复杂的局势中，他也能跳出个人恩怨的漩涡，一视同仁、平等地对待群众和干部。国清同志一生坚持原则、严以律己、清正廉洁、克己奉公。无论是在战争年代还是在和平建设时期，从不为个人、亲属和身边的工作人员谋求私利和特权。战场缴获的胜利品，他一点不沾。下部队检查工作，绝不允许加菜。在越南患胃溃疡，也不提任何特殊照顾，只靠稀饭支撑自己的身体。地方企业送审的新产品，审定即退，不准以试用等名义留作己用。1977年他任总政治部主任后，有的同志想把他的一个子女调进部队，他知道后马上加以制止。他的两个弟弟至今仍在乡村务农。检查工作中，他不仅接触团以上干部，还直接到团召开有连排干部参加的座谈会，并且不拘形式。他主持总政工作中，尽可能不采取画圈的方式而以办公会的形式研究解决问题。在贯彻执行党的高级干部生活准则中，规定原配发的东西，有的需要退还时，他立即上缴。从这些平凡的事情中，反映出他一个共产党员清正、无私的高尚品德。
    国清同志坚定的共产主义信抑、顽强的革命意志，崇高的情操和优秀品德，永远铭刻在我们的心中，他所创建的革命功绩，永载史册！
