New China News Agency, Manila, August 3rd.

More than 30 members of the Filipino-Chinese Delegation from Various Circles held a meeting on the evening of August 2nd to discuss their recent visit to China.

Xu Weixin, the leader of the delegation and the director of the Philippine Hongmen Progressive Party headquarters, said at the meeting that the delegation had learned the details of how the student movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square developed into a counter-revolutionary riot and had seen with their own eyes that after the riot was suppressed, Beijing's political situation was stable, people's lives were peaceful, and social order was restored. The facts were completely the opposite of the rumors and distortions spread by "Voice of America" and some newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan about the Tiananmen incident. Deng Xiaoping and the Chinese leadership's decision to take resolute measures to suppress the riot was responsible to the people.

Ding Jinchao, the deputy leader of the delegation and the director of the Philippine Zhulin Agreement Association, said that the turmoil in Tiananmen was due to foreign interference. They feared China's strength and tried to use the students' patriotic enthusiasm to create chaos in China. China, as an independent sovereign state, would not yield to external disruption and pressure, which was only natural. He said that the martial law troops in Beijing had a harmonious relationship with the people.

Member of the delegation Zhuang Zhongjian expressed his belief that after this turmoil, China would summarize its experiences and lessons, adhere to and accelerate the pace of reform.

Secretary-General Lin Ze'an said that the Chinese authorities had made a wise decision to stop the turmoil from spreading. Through this incident, China would definitely correct its mistakes in education, news propaganda, and other areas, and advance the cause of reform and opening up.

Li Kangxi, the president of the Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Caloocan City, and other members of the delegation also spoke at the meeting. They said they would help overseas Chinese and Chinese people in the Philippines understand the truth about the Tiananmen incident by exhibiting the photos they took during their visit to China and showing videos.

The delegation visited Beijing and Tianjin from July 25th to August 1st at the invitation of the Chinese government. They visited Tiananmen Square and factories, markets, and famous historical sites in Beijing and Tianjin. They also met and held talks with relevant officials from the Beijing martial law troops, the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, and the Beijing Municipal Government. Vice Premier Wu Xueqian met with the entire delegation.

    菲华各界北京考察团谈访华观感
    平息暴乱是对人民负责
    新华社马尼拉8月3日电  （记者翟树耀）菲华各界北京考察团30多名成员于8月2日晚在这里举行座谈会，畅谈他们最近访华的观感。
    考察团团长、菲律宾洪门进步党总部理事长许维新在座谈会上说，考察团在访问中了解了北京天安门由学潮发展到反革命暴乱的详情，亲眼看到暴乱平息后，北京政局稳定，人民生活安定，社会秩序井然。事实与“美国之音”和港、台一些报刊对天安门事件的造谣和歪曲报道完全相反。邓小平和中国领导人采取坚决措施平息暴乱是对人民负责。
    考察团副团长、菲律宾竹林协议会理事长丁晋朝说，天安门出现了动乱，是由于有外国力量插手，他们害怕中国强大，想利用学生的爱国热情，搞乱中国。中国是独立的主权国家，不屈服于外来的捣乱和压力，是理所当然的。他说，北京戒严部队与人民关系融洽。
    考察团成员庄中坚表示相信，中国经过这次动乱后会总结经验教训，坚持并加快改革步伐。
    考察团秘书长林泽安说，中国当局当机立断，坚决制止动乱蔓延，这是英明的。通过这次事件，中国一定会改正在教育、新闻宣传等方面的失误，使改革、开放事业迈进一大步。
    卡洛奥坎市菲华商会会长李康希和考察团其他成员也在会上发言。他们表示将通过展出他们拍摄的访华照片和放映录像，帮助旅菲华侨、华人了解北京天安门事件的真相。
    考察团从7月25日到8月1日应邀访问了北京和天津。他们参观了天安门广场以及京、津两地的工厂、市场、名胜古迹等，同北京部分戒严部队和国务院侨办、北京市人民政府等有关方面负责人进行了会见和座谈，吴学谦副总理会见了考察团全体成员。
