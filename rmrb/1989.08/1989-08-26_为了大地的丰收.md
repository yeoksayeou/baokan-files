For the Harvest of the Earth

Frying beans for everyone to eat, but the frying pan is your own. Who would do a losing business? I will!

The man walking towards us, over 50 years old, is Liang Qingzeng, an agricultural technician from Caoting Bridge Township, Yutian County, Hebei Province. Since 1974, he has been insisting on conducting seed comparisons and various fertilizer and pesticide experiments in his own fields and contracted lands for 15 years. If successful, he promotes it to more farmers; if it fails, he bears the loss himself. In the eyes of the world, he is doing a genuine losing business.

Many people do not understand him. But he says, "Chinese scientists have developed so many new grain varieties. If no one grows them and no one promotes them, aren't they just like flowers in a mirror and the moon in water?"

Spring has come, and everyone is busy planting. Liang Qingzeng's family is even busier. Others plant only one variety and sow once, but Old Liang's fields have to be sown with 11 varieties, each variety sown three times in parallel, making it 33 times. Look, there are rows of jars and pots at the edge of his field, like a small stall.

During the wheat harvest season, under the scorching sun and the threat of sudden rain, farmers are frantically cutting, pulling, and threshing. But why isn't Old Liang's family in a hurry? He pulls the wheat one ridge at a time, carries it one load at a time, rubs it one handful at a time, and fills the jars and pots, hanging a small sign...

Why does Old Liang do this? There is a story behind it. In his second year as an agricultural technician, the 5,000 mu of "Black Jade" corn seeds introduced to their village had high yields but short stalks, making it easy for rats to damage. The villagers angrily called it "Rat's Delight." Old Liang understood that although scientists develop many new varieties every year, due to different climates and conditions in various places, they must be tested and demonstrated before they can be promoted.

Liang Qingzeng's seed comparison experiments are like flowers that never fade in all four seasons. Rice, wheat, corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts, soybeans, and other grains, he does them all, and the more he does, the more enthusiastic he becomes. In the early years, he quietly conducted the experiments. Later, when he achieved results and gained fame, even the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences directly contacted him for experimental projects. Now, he undertakes two or three projects each year and more than ten seed comparison experiment tasks!

In the summer of 1987, after he promoted the high-yield corn variety Jingzao Six to society, he accepted the "Zhongdan 206" corn experiment project from the agricultural academy. That year, his neighbor's Jingzao Six yielded 600 kg per mu, while his "Zhongdan 206" yielded only 300 kg. Fortunately, the science and technology department gave some experimental funds; otherwise, he would have lost money again.

The next year, Old Liang held onto the last bit of hope and conducted the "Zhongdan 206" corn risk experiment alone. From the day the seeds sprouted, Old Liang was in the fields every day, with a small measuring box in his pocket, measuring the growth of the leaves every day. When autumn came, what was presented to Old Liang was still a heartbreaking scene. The strong seedlings suddenly showed early wilting, with leaves withering and roots dying. That year, his 2.2 mu of land yielded only 450 kg of grain, 500 kg less than others. Someone calculated for Old Liang that in 15 years, Old Liang had lost at least 2,500 kg of grain due to the experiments. Old Liang said, "No matter how much I lose personally, there is a limit. If we don't conduct experiments and blindly introduce seeds, the loss to the masses would be immeasurable."

Failure breeds success. In 15 years, Liang Qingzeng has conducted 64 projects and 72 variety comparison experiments for corn, early rice, wheat, and other crops. He has successively promoted 17 superior varieties to the county, city, province, and the whole country. Among them, the rice varieties Hanjiu and Beifeng, which he promoted through comparison experiments, can increase yield by more than 50 kg per mu. The corn varieties Yashan 4 and Jingzao Six can increase yield by 125 kg per mu.

Previously, the farmers here had to buy rice from outside for generations. Since 1982, when Liang Qingzeng successfully conducted early rice variety comparison experiments at home, it has now developed to over 10,000 mu.

With the footsteps of tens of thousands of visitors and the mailbags of seeds sent to Tibet, Guizhou, Anhui, and other five provinces and cities, Liang Qingzeng's name is known by more and more people. He has been evaluated as an advanced individual in the county and city for many years, and his family has been evaluated as a scientific farming demonstration household in Hebei Province.

    为了大地的丰收
    张宝华　郑书印
    炒豆大伙吃，炸锅是自家的，赔本的买卖谁做？
    我做！迎面走来的这位50多岁汉子梁庆增，是河北省玉田县彩亭桥镇农技推广员。他从1974年到现在整整15年，坚持在自家田园和承包地搞种子品比和各种肥料、农药试验。成功了，推广给更多的农民；失败了自己承担。在世俗的眼光里，他做的是一种地地道道的赔本买卖。
    好多人不理解他。可是他说：“中国的科学家们研究出那么多粮食新品种，没人试种，无人推广，岂不成了镜中花、水中月了吗？”
    春天来了，家家户户种田忙。梁庆增一家更忙。人家种地只有一个品种，播一次，可老梁这地就得播11个品种，每个品种并列重播三次，就是33次。瞧，他地头上摆着一排坛坛罐罐，像个摆小摊的。
    麦收时节，火辣太阳的直射，突降暴雨的威胁，庄稼人都拚命割，拚命拉，拚命地打。可老梁一家怎么也不着急？他麦子一垄一垄地拔，一趟一趟地背，一把一把地搓，还要装满坛坛罐罐，挂个小牌牌……
    老梁为啥要这样干？这里面还有一段故事。那是他当农技推广员的第二年，他们村引种的5000亩“黑玉”玉米种，产量虽高可秸秆过矮，竟便宜了老鼠，老百姓气愤地叫它“耗子乐”。老梁明白了，尽管科学家们每年都研究出许多新品种，但因各地气候和条件不同，必须试种、示范后才能推广。
    梁庆增搞的品比试验项目，就像一年四季开不败的花，水稻、小麦、玉米、白薯、花生、黄豆等五谷杂粮，他无一不搞，越搞越上劲儿。头些年，他只是默默地搞，后来出了成果，有了名气，连中国农科院都直接找他联系试验项目。如今他每年要承担两三个项目，十几个种子品比试验任务哩！
    1987年夏播季节，当他把试验成功的高产玉米京杂六号推向社会后，又接受了农科院的“中丹206”玉米试验项目。这一年，邻居家种的京杂六号亩产600公斤，而自己的“中丹206”才300公斤，幸亏科技部门给了点试验费，否则又亏本了。
    第二年老梁抱着最后一线希望，独自进行“中丹206”玉米风险试验。从种子破土那天起，老梁就天天在地里转，口袋里装个小盒尺，每天量量叶子生长的尺度。秋天来了，展现在老梁面前的仍然是痛心的场景，好壮的苗突然出现了早衰，叶枯根死。这一年他的2亩2分地仅打450公斤粮食，比别人家少打500公斤，有人给老梁算了一笔帐，15年来，老梁为搞试验至少损失2500公斤粮食。老梁却说：“俺个人损失再多也有个数，如果不搞试验，盲目引进种子，那群众的损失就没数了。”
    失败中孕育着成功。15年来，梁庆增共搞玉米、早稻、小麦等64个项目，72个品种品比试验，先后向县、市、省及全国推出优种17个。其中经他品比试验推出的水稻寒九、北风每亩可增产50多公斤，玉米掖单4、京杂六每亩可增125公斤。
    昔日这里的农民祖祖辈辈吃大米靠花钱到外地买，自从1982年梁庆增在家搞早稻品比试验成功后，如今已发展到1万多亩。
    随着上万参观者的脚步和邮袋里寄往西藏、贵州、安徽等5省市的种子，梁庆增的名字被越来越多的人所熟悉。他连年被评为县、市先进个人，全家被评为河北省科技种田示范户。
