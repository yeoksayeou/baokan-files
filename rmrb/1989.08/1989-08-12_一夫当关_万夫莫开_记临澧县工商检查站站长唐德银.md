	One Man Guards the Pass, Ten Thousand Cannot Open It
	—In Memory of Tang Deshen, Director of the Linli County Economic Inspection Station
	Yu Hanqing

	The Zhanggong Temple Ferry, located in the middle reaches of the Li River in Hunan, is said to have been where Zhang Fei camped during the Three Kingdoms period. Zhang Fei was known for his fiery temper, fair and honest dealings, and his respect for the local people. He did not disturb the locals, and he was deeply respected by the people. Later generations built a temple here in his memory, naming it Zhanggong Temple. Just beside the ferry where Zhang Fei once stood guard, the Linli County Economic Inspection Station was established last year. Tang Deshen is the director of this station.

	The Zhanggong Temple Ferry is on the national highway, with over four to five thousand vehicles passing through daily, sometimes reaching over ten thousand. When the station was first established, there were many complaints from those being inspected, and some even cursed Tang Deshen and his colleagues as the "Yamen's army." Whether people understood or misunderstood, Tang Deshen and his colleagues always upheld the law. The bureau's "Integrity Book" records: Over the past two years, the Economic Inspection Station has refused 34 invitations to dine, rejected 63 requests for favors, and refused 40 gifts and bribes, totaling over 13,000 yuan in cash and goods. Among these, Tang Deshen alone has refused over 4,000 yuan in bribes this year. As for other incidents such as offending superiors or friends, there are too many to count. The colleagues in the station and the surrounding community gave Tang Deshen a nickname: "Living Zhanggong," meaning to praise Tang Deshen for his fair and honest dealings, inheriting the excellent qualities of Zhang Fei.

	In February of this year, several tobacco smugglers brought six hundred thousand jin of roasted tobacco to the Zhanggong Temple Ferry, intending to sell it at a high price in Hubei. They were stopped by Tang Deshen, who was on duty that day. Tang Deshen said, "According to the regulations of the provincial government and the tobacco monopoly law, your tobacco leaves are being seized and will be dealt with accordingly." At first, the smugglers seemed calm. In their view, such inspections were just a show! In the two years they had been in the tobacco business, they had broken through countless checkpoints and did not believe they had entered the "gate of death" this time! They were confident in their "passing skills." After a stalemate, a middle-aged man tried to give Tang Deshen 2,000 yuan, which was pushed back by Tang Deshen. They then assumed that the reason Tang Deshen did not take their money was that it was too little. So, they took out 3,000 yuan and tried to give it to Tang Deshen again. Facing the 3,000 yuan, Tang Deshen thought of his own humble home: in 1985, he built three flat rooms and still owed 6,000 yuan, which had not been repaid. His television was a 14-inch model, and his son was nagging to buy an 18-inch color one. But Tang Deshen believed that personal hardship was a small matter, while losing party spirit and integrity was dangerous and tragic. He decided not to take the dirty money. The tobacco smugglers had high hopes for the 3,000 yuan, thinking that this "trick" could bring Tang Deshen down. The driver even started the car. They never imagined that Tang Deshen would take their money and give them a receipt with a big red seal for the fine.

	Tang Deshen does not yield to money, nor does he yield to pressure.

	In May of this year, a certain provincial government's directly-administered city bought a Volga car from Guangzhou, which was found by Tang Deshen to have evaded 20,000 yuan in taxes. The person involved, relying on their powerful backer, arrogantly demanded "special treatment." Tang Deshen, of course, did not agree. Two days later, a deputy director of the provincial commerce bureau came to Zhanggong Temple, asking Tang Deshen, "Why are you turning against your own people?" He also warned, "You are the director of the ferry, and I am the director of the bureau. You are a ninth-rank official, and I am a seventh-rank official. Do I know less about commercial regulations than you? We are colleagues and should row the same boat and paddle the same oar. Will your county's cars still go to our province in the future? You may also need to go to our place for cases in the future!" During these days, Tang Deshen received countless notes and calls, all from influential people, with one purpose: to release the car. For a while, he was "frantic." But in the end, Tang Deshen "twisted the arm of the thigh" and insisted on handling the matter according to commercial regulations.

	Tang Deshen, in order to do a good job in economic inspection, always insists on diligently studying business knowledge. He is familiar with 190-plus commercial regulations. When handling cases, he can quickly cite legal bases, making the parties involved speechless. These "sharpening skills" often make him achieve "effortless success" in handling cases. Once, the "speculators" used a cover-up tactic, placing banned items on the car first, then covering them with a tarp, and spreading sand on top. At first glance, it looked like a sand-carrying car! But when the car reached the Zhanggong Temple Ferry, Tang Deshen saw through the deception at a glance and dealt with it seriously. Afterwards, his colleagues asked him, "How did you know it was a disguise?" He told everyone, "Whether it's a disguise or not, it all depends on the steel plate and the tires. If it's carrying sand, it won't be light. If the steel plate doesn't 'show' and the tires don't 'mean' anything, it's definitely fake." Everyone had to admire his "keen eyes."

	Tang Deshen's enforcement of the law inevitably involves arguments with passing drivers and passengers. Sometimes, when inspecting vehicles, people on the car say sarcastic and mocking words, but Tang Deshen does not show his attitude. Instead, he patiently explains the regulations, propagandizes the necessity of economic inspection, persuades with reason, and moves with emotion, making others willing to accept.

	Soft words cannot soften him, hard pressure cannot subdue him, and deception cannot fool him. One man guards the pass, ten thousand cannot open it. This is Tang Deshen—a character of an ordinary Communist Party member!

    一夫当关  万夫莫开
    ——记临澧县工商检查站站长唐德银
    于汉卿
    位居湖南澧水中游的张公庙渡口，相传三国时张飞曾在此安营扎寨。张飞性情刚烈，处事公正廉明，不扰地方，深得老百姓敬仰。后人为了纪念他，就在这里修了个庙，取名为张公庙。就在当年张飞把守的渡口边，去年建起了临澧县工商局经济检查站。唐德银就是这个检查站的站长。
    张公庙渡口处在国道线上，每天经过渡口的车辆不下于四五千辆次，有时多达万余辆。刚建站时，被检查对象怨言甚多，还有骂唐德银和他的同事为“榜爷的部队”的。人们理解也好，误解也好，唐德银和他的同事们总是秉公执法。局里的“廉洁簿”上载明：近两年里，经济检查站拒吃请三十四次，拒说情六十三次，拒礼拒贿四十次，现金及实物折款计一万三千多元。其中唐德银今年以来一人就拒贿四千多元。至于其他诸如冒犯上级、得罪亲友的事就数不胜数了。站里的同志和周围的群众送给唐德银一个雅号：“活张公”，意思是夸奖唐德银办事公正廉明，继承了张飞的优秀品质。
    今年二月，几个烟贩子拖六万斤烤烟到了张公庙渡口，准备拉到湖北去卖高价，被当天值班的唐德银扣住。唐德银说：“根据省人民政府的规定和烟草专卖条例，现将你们的烟叶扣下来，听候处理。”开始，烟贩显得很平静。在他们看来，这类检查无非是个把戏！做烤烟生意两年来，多少次斩关夺隘，不相信这次就进了“鬼门关”！他们深信自己的“攻关术”！僵持一会后，一个中年人塞给唐德银两千元人民币，被唐德银用手挡了回去。他们进而断定，对方不收他们的钱，是嫌少了。于是拿出三千元，再次塞给唐德银。面对三千元人民币，唐德银不是没有想到自己寒酸的家：一九八五年建三间平房欠下的六千元，至今还未还完，电视机是十四英寸的，儿子吵着要买十八英寸带色的。但唐德银认为，个人寒酸事小，丢掉党性和人格才是危险而可悲的，不干净的钱决不能要。几个烟贩子对三千元人民币也寄予“厚望”，满以为这一“招”可以把唐德银打倒，司机甚至发动了汽车。他们万万没有想到，唐德银收了他们的钱，“报答”他们的竟是一张盖有大红印的罚款收据。
    唐德银不屈服于金钱，也不屈服于压力。
    今年五月的一天，某省一直辖市人民政府从广州买的一辆伏尔加小汽车被唐德银查出偷漏二万元税的问题，当事人自恃后台老板硬，蛮横地要求“作特殊情况处理”。唐德银当然不答应。两天后，直辖市一位工商局副局长专程赶到张公庙，责问唐德银“同室操戈相煎何急”？还带着威胁的口吻教训说：“你是渡口的站长，我是大局的局长，你是九品，我还是七品，工商法规我比你懂得少？我们是同行，应该同乘一条船，共操一把桨。你们县里的车今后还要到我们省去不去？你们今后办案也许还有去我们那里的时候呢！”就在这几天里，唐德银收到的条子、接到的电话不断，都是有来头的人，目的一个：放车。一度弄得他“焦头烂额”。但最终唐德银还是“胳膊拧过了大腿”，坚持按工商法规处理了这件事。
    唐德银为了做好经济检查工作，平时坚持孜孜不倦地学习业务知识。他熟悉一百九十多个工商法规。办起案子来，能迅速地说出法律依据，使当事人有口难辩。这些“磨刀工”使他常常在办案时收到“得来全不费功夫”之效。一次，“倒爷”们采取瞒天过海的办法，汽车上先堆放查禁物品，再在上面盖一层油布，油布上铺上砂子，乍一看，拖砂的！车开到张公庙渡口却被唐德银一眼识破，作了严肃处理。事后，同事们问他：“你怎么知道是伪装的呢？”他告诉大家：“伪装不伪装，全看钢板和轮胎。如果拖的是砂，决不是轻飘飘的样子。钢板没‘表示’，轮胎没‘意思’，肯定有假。”大家不得不佩服他的“火眼金睛”。
    唐德银执法把关，免不了要和来往司乘人员动口舌。有时检查车辆，车上的人说些讽刺、挖苦的话，唐德银也不耍态度，而是不厌其烦地讲法规，宣传经济检查的必要性，晓之以理，动之以情，使别人心悦诚服。
    软的软化不了他，硬的压服不了他，假的欺骗不了他。一夫当关，万夫莫开。这就是唐德银——一个普通共产党员的性格！
