	More and more Taiwanese businesses are coming to the mainland for investment and inspection. Increasingly, entrepreneurs are heading towards this "hope-filled market" on the mainland.

	According to a report by the Hong Kong-based "Ta Kung Pao," the Taiwan Machinery Association's gear subgroup has passed a resolution to organize a delegation for a 12-day visit to the mainland. The delegation is scheduled to depart on August 31, traveling from Hong Kong to Chongqing, Chengdu, Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai, where they will visit gear, machine tool, and measuring instrument factories to gain a firsthand understanding of the current situation in related industries on the mainland. Nearly 20 businesses have already signed up. Other industries in Taiwan are also preparing to visit the mainland for market inspections. The Taiwan Textile Machinery Association will participate in the apparel exhibition that opens on September 7 on the mainland.

	The "Economic Daily News" in Taiwan recently published a series of reports introducing the attitudes of Taiwanese businesspeople towards cross-strait economic and trade exchanges after the June Fourth incident. A Taiwanese businessman who has invested in a factory on the mainland for two years said that as long as the mainland's policy towards Taiwan does not change, there is still potential for investment on the mainland. The newspaper also pointed out that inspections by various industries in Taiwan to the mainland continue unabated, and new investments are also increasing. After ten years of reform, the sincerity of the Communist Party's opening-up policy has gradually been accepted by people. Coupled with signs of easing cross-strait relations, flexible and proactive Taiwanese entrepreneurs, facing this vast market, naturally do not want to fall behind. After some "pioneers" have made initial forays, more and more entrepreneurs are also stepping onto this "hope-filled market" on the mainland.

    愈来愈多台湾厂商前来大陆投资考察
    新华社香港8月8日电  据台湾报纸报道，前往大陆投资、考察的厂商日趋增多，愈来愈多的企业家走向大陆这块“充满希望的市场”。
    据香港《大公报》报道，台湾区机器公会齿轮小组已通过决议，计划组团前往大陆作为期12天的参观访问。这个团定于8月31日启程，由香港转赴重庆、成都、北京、南京、上海，沿线参观齿轮、机床、量具等工厂，实地了解大陆有关行业的现况。目前已有近20家业者报名。台湾其他一些行业也准备前往大陆考察市场。台湾纺织机械团即将参加9月7日在大陆揭幕的成衣展。
    台湾《工商时报》最近刊登系列报道，介绍北京六·四事件后台商对两岸经贸往来的态度。一位在大陆投资设厂两年的台商表示，只要大陆对台政策不变，在大陆的投资就仍有可为。这家报纸还指出，台湾各行业前往大陆的考察仍旧不断，新投资也继续增加。经过十年的改革，中共开放的诚意已逐渐为人们所接受，加上两岸关系有逐渐缓和的迹象，灵活积极的台湾企业家，面对此一广大的市场，当然也不愿落于人后，经过一些“拓荒者”的试探之后，愈来愈多的企业家也一步一步走向大陆这块“充满希望的市场”。
