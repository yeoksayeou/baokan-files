    Marshal Xu Xianqian has written the titles for two books: "History of Mass Work" co-authored by the General Political Department's Mass Work Department and Xi'an Political Academy, and "In the Republic's Moment of Crisis" co-authored by the General Political Department and Beijing Municipality.

    The first book showcases the glorious journey of the People's Liberation Army's close bond with the people, fighting side by side, and jointly achieving victory over the past sixty-plus years. It systematically summarizes the rich experiences of mass work in different historical periods. The second book reflects the new bond of fish-and-water relationship between the military and civilians in the capital during the suppression of the rebellion, serving as an excellent teaching material for traditional education and current ideological and political work.

    徐帅为《群众工作史》等题书名
    本报讯  日前，徐向前元帅为总政群工部和西安政治学院共同编写的中国人民解放军《群众工作史》及总政同北京市合编的《在共和国危急的时刻》两本书题写了书名。
    前一本书展现了我军创建六十多年来与人民鱼水相依、并肩战斗、共同夺取胜利的光荣历程，系统总结了不同历史时期开展群众工作的丰富经验。后一本书反映了平息暴乱中，首都军民相互支持结下的新的鱼水情谊，是传统教育和现实思想政治工作的好教材。
