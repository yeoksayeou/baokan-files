In mid-May, the authors went to a certain regiment of the Xinjiang Military Region to conduct research. While chatting with a few colleagues, they learned that the regiment's leaders were exemplary in their hard work and self-denial, setting a fine example for others.

The leaders of this regiment live in simple, makeshift houses built in 1965. The walls are made of mud bricks, the floors are concrete, and there are no bathrooms. The total area is only about 60 square meters. Four years ago, the military region conducted a survey of the barracks and found that the foundations of these houses were sinking, the walls had cracks, and the ceilings leaked. They were listed as dangerous and dilapidated, and 440,000 yuan was allocated in several installments to build new houses. When the regiment's leaders discussed the construction of new houses, they all said: "Our houses are a bit dangerous and dilapidated, but they won't collapse immediately, so we can manage for a few more years. There are still many officers in the regiment who have families but no houses. This money should be used to solve their urgent needs first." Now, 144 officers below the rank of colonel in the regiment's headquarters and directly affiliated units have moved into spacious and bright new buildings, while they continue to live in the old, dilapidated mud houses.

The regiment's units are highly dispersed. The regiment's leaders need cars to go to the units or to attend meetings at the military region. In the past, the regiment's car service only had Beijing Jeeps. Later, although the military region provided a "Patrol Boat" and a "Mitsubishi" car, there were still not enough vehicles for everyone. In recent years, many comrades in the regiment's headquarters have suggested that the regiment buy a few imported sedans, but these proposals were all rejected by the regiment's Party Committee. Last winter, five leaders of the regiment went to the military region for a meeting. They squeezed into a Beijing Jeep, freezing so much that they had to take turns sitting in the front to warm up.

When the interview ended, we discussed our impressions with the regiment's political commissar. He said calmly, "These things shouldn't be news. Our country is still poor and backward, and it will take several generations of hard work to change that. As the new generation of the '359th Brigade,' the spirit of Nanmoyuan is always in our hearts and will not be lost in our units."

The political commissar reflected on the past and said with emotion, "To advocate hard work and self-denial, leaders must take the lead. Only when leaders set an example can the call for hard work be implemented. Now, the people are not worried about how many difficulties we face, but whether the leaders are serious. As long as the leaders take the lead, the people will voluntarily follow."

### 心窝里装着“南泥湾”——新疆军区某师党委成员艰苦奋斗二三事

    心窝里装着“南泥湾”
    ——新疆军区某师党委成员艰苦奋斗二三事
    杨功成　李伦兴
    5月中旬，笔者到新疆军区某师调查研究，与几位同行
  “侃大山”时得知，这个师的领导干部艰苦奋斗，带头过“紧日子”的事迹很是感人。
    这个师领导干部的住房是1965年盖的简易平房，土坯墙，混凝土地面，没有卫生间，面积也只有60余平方米。四年前，军区普查营房，见这群住宅地基开始下陷，墙壁出现裂缝，顶棚漏水，便列为危破房屋，并先后拨款44万元，批准修建新房。师领导成员在讨论建房问题时都说：我们的住房尽管有些危破，但还塌不了，可以凑合几年。师里还有不少家属随军的干部没有屋子住，这笔钱应该先为他们解决燃眉之急。如今，师机关和直属分队的144名团以下干部相继住上了宽敞明亮的新楼房，他们却依然“坚守”在破旧简陋的土屋里。
    这个师所属部队高度分散。师领导下部队或到军区开会都离不开车子。过去，师小车班只有清一色的北京吉普，后来，尽管军区配备了一台“巡洋舰”、一台“三菱”车，但“僧多粥少”。这几年，师机关不少同志曾多次提议师里购买几台进口小轿车，每次都被师党委否决。去年冬天，5名师领导去军区开会，挤坐在一辆北京吉普里，冻得他们直打哆嗦，只好替换着到前排座位暖暖身子。
    结束采访时，我们同师政委谈起了采访的感受，他淡淡地说：“这些事情不该成为新闻。我们国家还贫穷、落后，需要几代人的艰苦奋斗才行。作为‘三五九旅’的新一代，‘南泥湾精神’始终装在我们的心窝里，决不会让这个老传统在我们部队失传。”
    师政委抚今追昔，感慨地说：“提倡艰苦奋斗过紧日子，首先要从领导做起。只有领导带头，艰苦奋斗的口号才能落实。现在群众并不担心我们面前有多少困难，而是担心领导动不了真格的。只要领导带头，群众就会自觉去做。”
