Over the past year, the issue of deceptive advertising in Japan has seen a sharp increase, leading to strong dissatisfaction among consumers. According to statistics from Japan's Advertising Review Organization, the organization received 1,940 inquiries related to advertising in 1988, a nearly 40% increase from the previous year's 1,397 inquiries. The scope of consumer complaints and inquiries is very broad, covering supermarkets, furniture stores, banks, high-interest loans, private schools, vocational education, real estate, and household appliances, among others. Among these, recruitment and home-based business advertisements are particularly problematic.

Recruitment advertisements are full of tricks. For example, one advertisement for sales representatives stated: "Earn 60,000 yen in 6 days," "No professional knowledge or experience required." In reality, it coerces job applicants into purchasing large quantities of fabric.

In the realm of home-based businesses, there are numerous cases of bait-and-switch tactics. One advertisement claimed: "Recruiting home workers to knit labor gloves and socks, suitable for retirees and housewives as a home-based business, with a guarantee to 'always purchase the products.'" However, when applicants purchase the knitting machine and produce the items, the advertiser refuses to buy them back, citing "product quality issues."

Even more serious are the advertisements from some educational institutions that mislead students. Some schools use the issuance of certificates as a lure to recruit students, boasting: "Students who obtain the certificate can start their own business, which also helps with employment and career changes." In reality, such certificates are not recognized by society. Additionally, these schools, in addition to tuition fees, impose various other fees under different names.

    弄虚作假的广告
    去年以来，日本广告弄虚作假的情况急剧增加，引起消费者强烈不满。据日本广告审查机构统计，1988年度该机构共受理了有关广告的查询1940次，比上一年度的1397次增加近40％。消费者投诉、查询的范围非常广泛，从超级市场、家具店到银行、高利贷、私塾、业余教育、不动产、家用电器等。其中，招聘、家庭副业方面的广告问题尤多。
    招聘广告骗人的花样繁多。例如有一征聘推销员的广告写道：“6天可赚6万日元”，“不需专业知识与经验”。但实际上是诱迫应聘人员购买大量布匹。
    家庭副业方面的广告挂羊头卖狗肉者层出不穷。有一广告称：征聘在家劳动者织劳动用手套、袜子，可作为退休人员、家庭主妇的家庭副业，并保证“永远购买其产品”。但糟糕的是，当应聘者购买编织机织出产品，做广告者却以“产品不合格”为由拒绝收购。
    更为严重的是，有些教育机构的广告误人子弟。有的学校以发给文凭为幌子招收学员，并吹得天花乱坠：“学生取得文凭后可以独立开业，也有助于就业、转职”。但实际上，这类学校的文凭社会不予承认。此外，这类学校除授课费外，还巧立名目收取繁多的费用。
