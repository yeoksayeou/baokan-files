In the United States, a country of many ethnicities, there is a significant number of Latin American immigrants. Some of them hold certain positions, but many face issues such as discrimination, low income, and low levels of cultural and educational attainment.

Latin Americans initially came to the United States as laborers. At the end of the 19th century, the first batch of Mexican workers arrived to help build the railways in the southwestern region. However, most of the Mexicans currently in the United States arrived in the 20th century. During World War II, the United States faced a labor shortage and signed an agreement with Mexico, bringing in a large number of seasonal workers to the north. In the 1960s, at least 4.8 million Mexican seasonal workers were employed in 38 states. Later, many Mexicans illegally crossed the border, becoming "illegal workers," and the immigration issue became a challenge between the two countries.

In the 1950s, Puerto Ricans became the first Latin Americans to arrive in the United States by air, with approximately 45,000 people arriving each year, most of whom settled in New York and surrounding areas. After the Cuban Revolution, a large number of middle and upper-class technical personnel settled in the United States. After the U.S. and Cuba signed a migration agreement in 1973, 257,000 Cubans moved to the United States. In 1980, Castro announced that Cubans could freely leave Cuba, and within four months, 117,000 people arrived in Florida, including many criminals.

Currently, there are immigrants from all Latin American countries in the United States, and there are Latin Americans in every state. Cities like New York have over 200,000 Latin American immigrants. In 1950, there were fewer than 4 million Latin Americans in the United States, but by 1984, this number had risen to 17.6 million. It is estimated that by the year 2000, this number will reach 30 to 35 million, accounting for 11-12% of the U.S. population.

Most Latin American immigrants come to the United States due to economic difficulties, overpopulation, high unemployment rates, and political turmoil in their home countries. They believe that finding employment in wealthy America is easy and that the standard of living is high, but they later discover that America is not the "paradise" they saw on television. Most Latin American immigrants in the United States are at the bottom of the social ladder, with low wages and basic living needs that cannot be met. Additionally, racial discrimination makes social relations in some minority residential areas very tense.

According to statistics, the family income of Latin Americans is only 68% of that of Americans, and 30% of Latin Americans live below the poverty line. Their unemployment rate is twice that of Americans. The proportion of Latin Americans with a university degree is only 7%, less than half of that of Americans.

The role and influence of Latin American immigrants in American society are increasing. For example, the mayors of San Antonio and Miami are Latin Americans. In the United States, there are 250,000 stores run by Latin Americans, with an annual sales volume of $12 billion. The annual consumption of Latin American immigrants reaches $50 billion, accounting for about 7% of U.S. retail trade.

Latin American immigrants living in the United States pay attention to preserving and promoting their own cultural traditions. There are 13 Spanish-language television stations in the United States. In Los Angeles, Latin Americans make up 35% of the population, and 67% of them watch Spanish-language programs. Latin American music is becoming increasingly popular, with an annual sales volume of $5 million for Latin American folk music records and tapes.

    美国的拉美移民
    管彦忠
    在美国这个多民族的国家里，拉丁美洲移民为数不少，他们之中有些人具有一定的地位，更多的则面临着受歧视、收入少和文化教育水平低等问题。
    拉美人最初是以劳工身份到美国的。上世纪末，美国修建西南地区的铁路时，第一批墨西哥劳工便到达那里。但目前在美国的墨西哥人大多数是20世纪移去的。二次大战期间，美国缺少劳动力，与墨西哥签署协议，大批季节工人到了北方。60年代，至少有480万墨季节工人在美国38个州干活。后来许多墨西哥人非法越过边界，成为“偷渡的苦工”，移民问题成为两国间的一个难题。
    50年代，波多黎各人成为第一批从空中到达美国的拉美移民，每年约4.5万人，大部分定居在纽约及附近地区。古巴革命胜利时，一大批中上层技术人员到美国定居。古美1973年签署移民协议后，25.7万古巴人移居美国。1980年，卡斯特罗宣布古巴人可以自由离开古巴，4个月内11.7万人抵达佛罗里达，其中有不少罪犯。
    目前，拉美所有国家在美国都有移民，美国各州都有拉美人，纽约等7个城市各有20万以上拉美移民。1950年，在美国的拉美人不足400万，1984年达到1760万，预计到2000年，将增至3000至3500万人，占美国居民的11—12％。
    多数拉美移民是因为本国经济困难、人口过多、失业率高以及政治动乱而到美国谋生的。他们以为在富裕的美国就业容易，生活水准高，但后来发现，美国并不是从电视上看到的“安乐园”。在美国的多数拉美移民处在社会下层，工资低，基本生活需要不能满足，再加上种族歧视，一些少数民族聚居区社会关系十分紧张。
    据统计，拉美人的家庭收入只相当于美国人的68％，30％的拉美人生活在贫困线以下，其失业率是美国人的两倍。拉美人中的大学毕业生比例只有7％，不到美国人比例的一半。
    拉美移民在美国社会生活中的作用和影响在增加，如圣安东尼奥市和迈阿密市的市长就是拉美人。在美国，拉美人经营的商店有25万家，年销售额达120亿美元，拉美移民年消费额达500亿美元，占美国零售贸易的7％左右。
    在美国生活的拉美移民，注意保持和发扬自己的文化传统。美国有13家西班牙语电视台。在洛杉矶，拉美人占居民的35％，其中67％的人收看西班牙语节目。拉美音乐日益普及，拉美民间音乐的唱片和录音带年销售额500万美元。
