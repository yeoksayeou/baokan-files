Poetry by Liu Lianyong

	Hasn't anyone told you,
	That the path ahead is fraught with difficulties?
	Drained by the clouds like hemp,
	Roasted by the wind until scorching;
	Haven't you felt beneath your feet,
	The surging waves pressing closer?
	All around, the tumultuous yellow waves,
	Swallow the sky and earth, blurring the direction.
	Why does the camel caravan still press on?
	Why does the camel bell still chime?
	The massive hoofprints and firm footprints,
	Sink in without a waver;
	Why like a ship cutting through the sand sea?
	Why like a sword piercing the wilderness?
	Insist on creating a verse of green,
	In the yellow-brown imagery!

   瀚海行舟
   赵亚洲　摄影
   刘连勇　配诗
   难道没人告诉你们，
   前方布满了困难？
   被云吸榨得像麻，
   被风煎炒得滚烫；
   难道没有感到脚下，
   一步步紧逼的气浪？
   四周汹涌黄色波涛，
   吞失了天地迷茫了方向。
   为什么驼队依然前行？
   为什么驼铃依然叮当？
   硕大的蹄印坚实的脚印，踏下去
   没有一丝摇晃；
   为什么像船剪开沙海？
   为什么像剑刺破蛮荒？
   偏要在黄褐色的意象里，
   创作一组葱绿的诗行！
