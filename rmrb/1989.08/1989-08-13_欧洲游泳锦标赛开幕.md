The 19th European Swimming Championships opened today in Bonn, West Germany.

A total of 1,500 athletes from 28 European associations will compete for 43 gold medals in swimming, water polo, diving, and synchronized swimming.

The powerful swimming nation, East Germany, has sent 37 athletes, including seven Olympic champions from the Seoul Games. Leading the team is Christine Otto, who won six gold medals, along with six athletes who have won medals in Seoul and nine who won titles in the 1987 championships.

For the host country, West Germany, it remains to be seen whether they can repeat their performance from the previous championships, where they won 17 medals (4 gold, 4 silver, 9 bronze).

    欧洲游泳锦标赛开幕
    新华社波恩八月十二日电（记者胡旭东）第十九届欧洲游泳锦标赛今天在联邦德国的波恩开幕。
    来自欧洲二十八个协会的一千五百名运动员将争夺游泳、水球、跳水和花样游泳等项目的四十三枚金牌。
    游泳强国民主德国派出了三十七名选手，其中有七名是汉城奥运会冠军，为首的应数六枚金牌获得者克里斯汀·奥托，还有六名选手曾在汉城获得过奖牌，九名运动员曾在一九八七年上届锦标赛上夺魁。
    对于东道主联邦德国来说，能否像上届一样夺得十七枚奖牌（四金、四银、九铜）还很难说。
