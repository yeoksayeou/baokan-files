    The Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases will be implemented starting September 1st. The 35 kinds of acute and chronic infectious diseases will be managed in three categories: A, B, and C. Mandatory isolation and treatment will be enforced for patients with Category A diseases and those with AIDS and pulmonary anthrax.

    Today, at a meeting to mobilize the entire society to study, promote, and implement the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, which will be implemented on September 1st, Vice Minister of Health He Jiesheng stated, "Currently, the situation for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in our country is very severe. Preventing and treating infectious diseases cannot be accomplished solely through administrative measures or the efforts of the health department; it requires the government to organize, departments to collaborate, and the entire population to work together for comprehensive management. Only by clearly defining the responsibilities of citizens, social organizations, and government departments through legal means and conducting social management in accordance with the law can we achieve lasting results in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases."

    He Jiesheng provided special explanations for several key points of the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. For example, the 35 kinds of acute and chronic infectious diseases that are subject to statutory management in our country, which have high incidence rates, wide spread, and serious harm, are classified into three categories: A, B, and C. This method, which has been proven effective through years of practice, focuses on key areas while addressing general issues economically. For patients with Category A infectious diseases, carriers of the pathogens, and patients with AIDS and pulmonary anthrax (which are classified as Category B), mandatory isolation and treatment will be implemented. From a legal perspective, this restricts the personal freedom of a few individuals, but it protects the health and safety of the majority and ensures the overall security of society.

    The Law also clearly defines the responsibilities of relevant social organizations and government departments through legal means. It is reported that the "Implementing Regulations of the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases of the People's Republic of China" will also be promulgated soon.

    传染病防治法9月1日起实施
    35种急慢性传染病按甲乙丙三类实行分类管理
    对甲类病人和艾滋病肺炭疽病人强制隔离治疗
    本报北京8月3日讯　记者艾笑报道：今天，在动员全社会学习、宣传、贯彻将于9月1日实施的我国《传染病防治法》的工作会议上，卫生部副部长何界生说：“当前我国传染病防治工作的形势十分严峻。防治传染病仅靠行政手段或卫生部门的力量难以完成，必须由政府组织、部门配合、全民动手综合治理。只有以法律形式明确公民、社会组织和政府部门的责任，依法进行社会管理，才能使传染病防治工作取得持久成效。”
    何界生对《传染病防治法》的几个有关问题作了特别说明。如：我国列为法定管理的发病率较高、流行面较大、危害严重的35种急慢性传染病，分为甲、乙、丙三类管理。这已被多年实践证明是突出重点，兼顾一般的经济有效方法。对甲类传染病病人，病原携带者和属于乙类的艾滋病病人，炭疽中的肺炭疽病人实行强制性隔离治疗，从法律角度看，是限制了少数人的人身自由，但保护了更多人的生命健康权，保证了整个社会的安全。
    《防治法》还以法律的形式明确规定社会有关组织和政府有关部门的责任。据悉，《中华人民共和国传染病防治法实施办法》近日也将颁布。
