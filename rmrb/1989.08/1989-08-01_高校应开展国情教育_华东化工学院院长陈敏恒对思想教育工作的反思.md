Two months ago, Chen Minheng, the president of the East China University of Chemical Technology, told the reporter: "Starting from next semester, we plan to replace the original four political courses with 'History and National Conditions,' 'Analysis of Western Society,' 'Socialism and Reform,' and 'Marxism and Philosophical Methodology.'" After the turmoil and unrest, university leaders are all reflecting. When I visited Chen Minheng again, he was even more determined to reform, clearly stating: All grades will take the new course 'History and National Conditions' next semester. I believe the biggest problem with college students is that they do not understand the national conditions.

Since the turmoil began, Chen Minheng has been on the front line, face-to-face with students. He debated with students advocating for a march at a school-wide meeting, wrote open letters answering students' questions and criticisms, and had individual conversations with dozens of students. Before May 4, no students in the entire school went out to march. However, after May 4, because someone in the central government publicly supported the turmoil and unrest, the school's work was ineffective.

The Misunderstanding of College Students: Lack of Understanding of National Conditions

Chen Minheng said that most of the students who came to talk to him were troubled in their thoughts. They were dissatisfied with the current state of society but also felt that causing a turmoil would not solve the problem. I told them that our country has seen phenomena such as official profiteering and corruption during the reform and opening up, so we need to rectify and regulate. This requires authority; otherwise, it cannot be rectified. How can students cause a turmoil to maintain the authority of the government? These students generally accepted this, so they did not participate in the march. As for those who led the turmoil, they would not come to talk to me. They admitted that they could not debate with me, but they still would not accept it. They proposed that the only way to solve the problem is "democracy." The democracy they want is to march on the streets and demand that the government accept their various demands. What is true democracy, and how to realize socialist democracy in China, they are not clear about. School leaders and teachers repeatedly told them that the construction of a democratic system requires a process. Our socialist system was established on the ruins of semi-feudal and semi-colonial rule, with deep influences of feudal ideology, and relatively backward economy and culture, especially the weak democratic consciousness and legal awareness of the people, so we cannot simply copy the democratic system of Western countries. The tragedy of the "Cultural Revolution" and the turmoil of 1986 have shown that if we adopt Western democracy in our country, it means turmoil. Even among college students with high cultural levels, a turmoil will cause chaos, which shows that students, including some intellectuals, are not mature. Unfortunately, many students cannot accept these reasons because they do not understand the national conditions of China.

Not understanding the national conditions, even the education of adhering to the four cardinal principles is not listened to, and on the contrary, the ideological trend of bourgeois liberalization is easily accepted. Chen Minheng said that adhering to the four cardinal principles, we have always been ringing the alarm bell, that is, to remind everyone that the four cardinal principles are absolutely not to be violated. However, for a long time, we have not really explained clearly the necessity of adhering to the four cardinal principles in the new era of reform and opening up? How to adhere to the four cardinal principles? As a result, the four cardinal principles have become an abstract shell, while the propaganda of bourgeois liberalization not only has many channels, the school cannot prevent it, but also is vivid and specific, and young students can easily accept it. Because they lack an understanding of China's national conditions, they expect that a highly democratic political system will appear overnight, and the level of productivity will reach that of developed Western countries.

In leading the reform of the East China University of Chemical Technology, Chen Minheng has devoted a lot of effort to improving ideological and political work and has made many beneficial explorations. The economic series of lectures organized by the school played a good role in clarifying students' vague understanding of China's economic system reform, and the cultural series of lectures provided a framework for students to think about problems.

Chen Minheng recalled these works and felt that because some of our young and middle-aged teachers do not truly understand the national conditions, they introduced more Western ideas and academic concepts. He said that originally, we wanted to do some enlightenment education on issues that young people discuss the most, such as freedom, equality, and the value of man, and then combine China's national conditions for in-depth education in the next step. We did not expect that we just took the first step, and the turmoil and unrest came. From the problems exposed in this turmoil, it is an urgent task to conduct national conditions education for college students, and the four new political courses we are going to take are an important way of national conditions education. Now we must hurry up and compile the textbooks.

Chen Minheng has not yet come up with a complete plan for how to conduct national conditions education, but he has some views on the content of education. He believes that talking about national conditions cannot be separated from talking about history, especially the history of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people to build a new China. However, the focus should be on the history of the past 40 years after liberation, the history of socialist construction, and the history of reform and opening up. Because this period of history is a period of much discussion and great controversy, it is also a period of history that is distorted and attempted to be completely denied by those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization.

Do Not Forget the Tragedy of the "Cultural Revolution"

Chen Minheng also believes that national conditions education must talk about the history of the 10-year "Cultural Revolution." The central government has made a resolution and has thoroughly denied it. However, have people truly recognized the "Cultural Revolution" and learned from the lessons? It is not the case. When we persuaded the students, we repeatedly reminded everyone not to forget the tragedy of the "Cultural Revolution." However, the students were still unmoved. Today's college students have not experienced the turmoil of the "Cultural Revolution," and they only have a simple conclusion or fragmented rumors about the "Cultural Revolution," lacking a comprehensive understanding, so the reminder is of no use. And from the whole process of this turmoil, some aspects are very similar to the "Cultural Revolution." For example, the vanguard is young students, and the result is that they are used by people with ulterior motives, evolving into a nationwide turmoil.

    高校应开展国情教育
    ——华东化工学院院长陈敏恒对思想教育工作的反思
    本报记者　萧关根
    两个月前，华东化工学院院长陈敏恒告诉记者：“从下学期起，准备把原来的4门政治课改为《历史与国情》、《西方社会分析》、《社会主义与改革》和《马克思主义与哲学方法论》。”学潮和动乱过后，高校的领导都在进行反思。当我再次访问陈敏恒时，他更坚定了改革的决心，明确地说：下学期所有年级都要上《历史与国情》这门新课。我认为大学生最大的问题是不了解国情。
    这次学潮开始后，陈敏恒一直在第一线面对面地做工作。他在全校大会上与主张游行的学生辩论，写公开信回答学生的疑问和责难，还同几十名学生个别谈话。5月4日以前，全校没有学生上街游行。然而，5月4日以后，因为中央有人公开支持学潮和动乱，学校的工作没有效果了。
    大学生的误区：不了解国情
    陈敏恒说，找我谈话的学生大多是思想上苦闷，他们对社会现状不满，但又感到闹学潮解决不了问题。我就告诉他们，我们国家在改革开放中出现了官倒和腐败现象，所以要治理整顿。这就需要有权威，不然无法整顿。学生这样闹怎么维护政府权威呢？这些学生一般都能接受，所以没有参加游行。至于那些带头闹的学生，他们是不会找我谈话的。他们承认辩论不过我，但就是不接受。他们提出，解决问题的唯一办法是“民主”。他们要的民主就是上街游行，要政府接受他们的种种要求。什么是真正的民主，在中国怎样实现社会主义民主，他们并不清楚。学校领导和教师反复告诉他们，民主制度的建设要有一个过程。我们的社会主义制度是在半封建半殖民地的废墟上建立起来的，封建思想的影响很深，经济、文化都相当落后，特别是人们的民主意识和法制观念还比较淡薄，所以不能照搬西方国家的那种民主制度。“文化大革命”的悲剧以及1986年的学潮都说明，在我们国家，如果搬用西方的民主，就意味着动乱。就是在文化程度很高的大学生中，一闹学潮也就会出乱子，这说明，学生们包括一些知识分子并不成熟。可惜的是，这些道理许多学生接受不了，因为他们不了解中国的国情。
    不了解国情，就连坚持四项基本原则的教育也听不进去，相反，对于资产阶级自由化的思潮却很容易接受。陈敏恒说，坚持四项基本原则，我们是一直作为警钟来敲的，就是要经常提醒大家，四项基本原则是绝对不能违背的。然而，长期以来我们没有真正讲清楚，在改革开放的新时期坚持四项基本原则到底有什么必要？怎样才能坚持四项基本原则？结果，四项基本原则变成了一个抽象的空壳，而资产阶级自由化的宣传不仅渠道多，学校防不胜防，而且是有血有肉，生动具体，青年学生很容易接受。因为他们对中国的国情缺乏了解，指望一夜之间就能出现高度民主的政治制度，就能达到西方发达国家的生产力水平。
    在领导华东化工学院改革中，陈敏恒对改进思想政治工作花了很大精力，做过不少有益的探索。学校组织的经济系列讲座，对澄清学生对我国经济体制改革的模糊认识起了很好的作用，文化系列讲座则为学生思考问题提供了思维框架。
    陈敏恒在回顾这些工作时感到，由于我们的一些中青年教师对国情也没有真正认识，比较多地介绍了西方的一些思想观点和学术概念。他说，原来，我们是想在自由、平等、人的价值等青年们议论最多的这些问题上做些启蒙教育，下一步再结合中国的国情深入教育，没想到刚刚走了第一步，学潮和动乱就来了。从这次动乱中暴露的问题来看，对大学生进行国情教育是很急迫的任务，我们要上的四门新政治课正是国情教育的重要途径。现在就要抓紧编写好教材。
    陈敏恒对怎样进行国情教育还提不出完整的计划，但他就教育的内容讲了点看法。他认为，讲国情离不开讲历史，特别是中国共产党领导中国人民创建新中国的历史。不过重点应该讲解放以后40年的历史，讲社会主义建设的历史，讲改革开放的历史。因为这段历史是人们议论多、分歧大的历史，也是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人集中加以歪曲企图全盘否定的历史。
    不要忘了“文革”动乱的悲剧
    陈敏恒还认为，国情教育一定要讲10年“文化大革命”的历史。中央对“文革”作了决议，已经彻底否定。但是人们是否真正认识了“文化大革命”并吸取了教训呢？并不这样。在劝阻学生时，我们一再提醒大家不要忘了“文化大革命”的悲剧。但是，学生们还是无动于衷。现在的大学生都没有经历过“文化大革命”的动乱，对于“文革”只有个简单的结论，或片断的传闻，缺少全面的了解，因而再提醒也没有用。而从这次动乱的全过程来看，某些方面是与“文化大革命”很相似的。如打头阵的是青年学生，结果被别有用心的人利用，演变成了一场蔓延全国的动乱。
