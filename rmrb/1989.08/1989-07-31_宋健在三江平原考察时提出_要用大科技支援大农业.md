Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 31st — (Reporter Wang Laixi) State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian recently proposed during an inspection of the Sanjiang Plain in Heilongjiang Province that advanced technology should be used to support large-scale agriculture, promoting grain production to a new level.

Song Jian led a Chinese government science and technology delegation to visit the Soviet Union and returned to the country via Suifenhe on July 25, directly conducting a five-day inspection of the Sanjiang Plain.

The Sanjiang Plain, commonly known as the "Northern Great Wilderness," is formed by the confluence of the Heilongjiang, Songhua, and Ussuri Rivers, covering a total area of 140,000 square kilometers with 51 million mu of cultivated land. There are 28 cities and counties and over 50 mechanized state farms here, making it one of China's important commercial grain bases.

The State Science and Technology Commission attaches great importance to the development and construction of the Sanjiang Plain. To change the situation of low yield and unstable total production, since the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," it has organized 11 universities, 48 research institutions, and 66 business departments, involving over 2,000 experts and technicians from multiple disciplines, to carry out comprehensive scientific and technological research and development activities. Five demonstration areas have been established, and 72 projects and over 150 topics have been tested and researched, achieving over 100 scientific research results, some of which have been widely promoted and applied.

Song Jian and his team inspected the 850th, 853rd, Baocheng County, and Fujin City comprehensive scientific and technological research and development demonstration areas, as well as the Friendship Farm's Fifth Brigade Second Team and the Honghe Farm, which are equipped with imported agricultural machinery. They observed the research and development results and experimental conditions, and met with experts and technicians at the research and development points, expressing warm greetings on behalf of the State Council.

Song Jian said that whether China's agriculture can advance to a new level in the coming period is a key issue for the survival and development of our country and nation. Therefore, agriculture needs to advance. For agriculture to advance, it cannot do without the support of advanced technology. Advanced technology must support large-scale agriculture. He hopes that basic research and high-tech research departments will tilt towards agricultural research. The research plan should increase investment in agricultural research. He required experts and technicians working in the Sanjiang Plain scientific and technological research and development demonstration area to bring a group of local apprentices. During the experiment, they should cultivate a group of local talents. If one person brings an apprentice, they can leave several dozen scientific and technological backbones for the local area when they leave. This is a matter of great significance. He also required the scientific research departments of state farms to open up to local areas, and local areas should select some people to learn from the farms.

How to promote scientific and technological progress in rural areas where family contracting and decentralized management are implemented? Song Jian introduced successful practices both domestically and internationally. He said that for farmers engaged in economic crops and livestock, cooperative associations should be gradually implemented, that is, organizing them to establish a full-service support system, responsible for technical guidance, pre-production and post-production services, market development, and post-production processing, and systematic, full-process scientific and technological services.

Heilongjiang Province Governor Shao Qihui, who was inspecting flood prevention work in the Sanjiang Plain, accompanied Song Jian to inspect some demonstration areas.

    宋健在三江平原考察时提出  要用大科技支援大农业
    据新华社哈尔滨7月31日电　（记者王来喜）国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健最近在黑龙江省三江平原考察时提出，要用大科技支援大农业，促使粮食生产登上一个新台阶。
    宋健是率中国政府科技代表团赴苏联访问，7月25日经绥芬河回国后，直接对三江平原进行为期五天的考察的。
    俗称北大荒的三江平原，由黑龙江、松花江、乌苏里江汇流冲积而成，总面积14万平方公里，现有耕地5100万亩。这里有28个市县和50多个机械化国营农场，是我国重要的商品粮基地之一。
    国家科委对三江平原的开发建设十分重视，为改变这里的单产不高，总产不稳的状况，“六五”以来，先后组织11个大专院校、48个科研单位、66个业务部门的2000多名多学科的专家和科技人员，开展三江平原综合科技攻关活动，先后建立了5个攻关试验示范区，进行了72个项目、150多个课题的试验研究，取得了100多项科研成果，有的已大面积推广应用。
    宋健一行先后考察了八五○农场、八五三农场、宝清县和富锦市四个综合科技攻关示范区，以及用引进农业机械装备起来的友谊农场五分场二队和洪河农场，观看攻关成果和试验状况，会见了攻关点上的专家和科技人员，代表国务院向他们表示亲切慰问。
    宋健说，全国农业能不能在今后一段时间内上一个台阶，是决定我们国家和民族能不能更好的生存，更好的发展的一个关键问题。所以，农业需要大上。农业要大上，离不开大科技的支援。大科技要支援大农业。希望基础研究，高技术研究部门，都要向农业研究方面倾斜。科研计划要增加向农业研究方面的投资。他要求在三江平原科技攻关示范区工作的专家和科技人员，要带一批当地徒弟。在试验过程中，为当地培养一批人才。一个人如果带一个徒弟，走时就能给当地留下几十个科技骨干。这是具有长远意义的大事。他还要求国营农场的科研部门要向地方开放，地方也要选一点人到农场去对口学习。
    农村实行家庭承包，分散经营，如何推广科学技术？宋健同志介绍了国内外的成功作法。他说，对经营经济作物和畜牧业的农户，要逐步实行合作协会的形式，就是组织起来，建立全程服务的支撑体系，负责搞技术上的指导，产前产后服务，市场开发，产后加工等系统的、全程的科技服务。
    正在三江平原检查防汛工作的黑龙江省省长邵奇惠，陪同宋健考察了部分示范区。
