A discussion on "freedom" and "democracy" in the United States was held by Wang, a lecturer at the Shanghai Air Force Political Academy, who had studied for a master's degree in American history in the United States and later spent eight months touring more than 20 states. During a class, he discussed with his students the true nature of "democracy" and "freedom" in American society, based on his personal experiences and vivid observations. Below is a transcript of the discussion.

**Few People Hear "Freedom of Speech"**

Student: Some people believe that the United States has "true freedom of speech," such as the right for ordinary Americans to criticize the president. Is this true?

Wang: Some people at home have idealized the concept of "freedom of speech" in the United States. I spent time among ordinary Americans and found that many of them do not value their "freedom of speech." If you praise them for having "freedom of speech," they often respond with, "Who listens to you?"

Student: Can you give an example to illustrate this?

Wang: (Pulls out a photograph) This is a photo I took at the White House. The old man in the photo was sitting on the grass near the White House, holding a sign that read, "Oppose Reagan's policy of increasing military spending!" The police were nearby but did not interfere with him. However, the old man sat there for many days, and no one paid attention to him.

Student: Can they express their opinions through the media?

Wang: Generally, the American media does not reflect the opinions of ordinary people. Take the old man in the photo, for example. After being ignored for a long time, he became angry and eventually took drastic measures.

Student: Did he commit suicide?

Wang: No. After returning to school, I saw this old man on the television news. He parked a truck under the Washington Monument, claiming that the truck was loaded with explosives and could blow up the monument at any time. Immediately, many reporters rushed to the scene, and the television broadcasted live coverage.

Student: I think our newspapers also reported this news at the time. Later, nothing happened with the Washington Monument, and there were no explosives in his truck, right?

Wang: Correct. There were no explosives in his truck. He saw the media arrive and thought his goal had been achieved. So, the old man got out of the truck and announced that there were no explosives in the truck. His purpose was simply to let the public hear his criticism of Reagan's policies.

Student: It is said that the American legal system is very strict. Is this true?

Wang: The United States has many legal provisions, and anyone can cite legal clauses. Criminals can hire famous lawyers to defend them, exploiting loopholes in the legal system to avoid punishment.

Student: The United States has many legal provisions, does this mean that the rights of the people to "democracy" and "freedom" are well protected?

Wang: Having many legal provisions does not mean that the people's rights to "democracy" and "freedom" are well protected. As I mentioned, criminals can also exploit loopholes in the legal system. Everyone knows that in American history, there have been multiple instances of presidents being assassinated. After Kennedy was assassinated, a large investigation team was formed, but in the end, it was inconclusive. The investigation into Reagan's assassination also had a similar conclusion to previous presidential assassinations, such as "personal impulse" and "mental illness." If the legal system cannot even protect the president, how can it protect the rights of ordinary citizens to "democracy" and "freedom"?

**Cunningly Crafted "Objective Reporting"**

Student: Some people say that Western media adhere to the principle of "neutrality" and generally provide "purely objective reporting" without propaganda or indoctrination. How should we understand this issue?

Wang: The American media is also controlled by various political forces and interest groups. They need to survive, so they cannot avoid serving certain interest groups. The American media's propaganda methods are just more sophisticated. Regarding their anti-communist propaganda, not only do ordinary Americans who are unaware of the situation get influenced, but even some young people in our country who lack social experience can unknowingly accept their views.

Student: Can you give a specific example to illustrate this situation?

Wang: For example, once I saw a segment in the "Mainland China" special program of the most influential Columbia Broadcasting Company in the United States. The reporter interviewed a platoon of our army in a certain infantry unit in North China. It first broadcast scenes of soldiers marching in formation and shooting, showing the soldiers' high morale. However, the next scene shifted to an auditorium where the American reporter asked our soldiers, "What will you do after demobilization?" The first soldier stood up and loudly replied, "Follow the country's arrangements!" The second soldier answered, "Listen to the party's arrangements!" Then, the third, fourth, and fifth soldiers followed suit. Just as the audience was about to laugh out loud, the television narrator slowly said, "Look, this is mainland China. There, people become screws on a machine, with no individual democracy and freedom, and their words are so repetitive..." The program ended abruptly. Who would doubt the authenticity of this video? I also believe that the soldiers answering the questions on the screen are real. But does this truly reflect the situation in mainland China? This requires actual experience of life in mainland China and a certain analytical ability to draw the correct conclusion. At that time, I told the Americans at my report meeting: The duty of a soldier is to serve the country. In such a solemn setting, seeing a group of blond-haired, blue-eyed, high-nosed Americans with cameras on their shoulders, how could they discuss "what to do after demobilization" with them? Who knows what their intentions are? If the same question were asked by their fiancées, parents, or close friends, then they would also talk at length about their personal plans. This is human nature. The American reporter concluded that mainland China has no democracy and freedom, which is a one-sided propaganda. Clearly, the video recorded does not equal a truly "objective report."

**Do Not Idealize the Two-Party System**

Student: Some people believe that the competition and rotation of power between the two parties in the United States is very democratic. How should we understand this issue?

Wang: The current competition between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States is not something the Americans created to embody the "democratic principle." The word "political party" does not appear in the American Constitution. The two-party system was naturally formed under certain historical conditions. When the United States was founded, it was not a two-party system. The founding father, President Washington, repeatedly warned the American people to beware of the harm of the two-party system and not to create a two-party system. In the course of historical development, the Federalist Party first appeared, and then the opposition Democratic-Republican Party. The Federalist Party disintegrated, and after a period of time, the Whig Party emerged. Before the Civil War in 1854, the abolitionists formed the Republican Party. Now, capitalist countries have a two-party system, a one-party system, and a multi-party system, all of which are formed under certain historical conditions and are not created to embody the principles of "democracy" or "dictatorship." It is the correct attitude to analyze various situations historically.

Student: Does the opposition party in the United States enjoy equal power with the ruling party? This refers to the power to compete in elections.

Wang: Not at all. In the United States, besides the Democratic and Republican parties, there are other small parties, which cannot enjoy equal election rights with the two major parties. For example, American law stipulates that each citizen pays one dollar per year in taxes to provide election funds, but parties that do not receive support from 5% of voters cannot receive this money. Therefore, the third party in the United States has never been able to develop.

Student: Do Americans today believe that their two-party system is a perfect embodiment of the democratic principle?

Wang: Today, Americans may not necessarily appreciate their two-party competition. I once discussed the two-party system with an American. He said, "You Chinese people must not idealize the two-party system. A one-party system can also practice democracy, which is very good." He also said, "Every four years, there is a big election, relying on money and empty promises to pull votes, scheming to outdo each other, and deceiving each other. Often, only half of the legal voters in the United States go to vote. The 'two-party system' in the United States does not give the people the right to make decisions, but rather a choice, 'choosing the lesser of two evils,' that's all."

Student: Does the United States have bureaucracy?

Wang: Yes. It is very serious. I often hear Americans complain about bureaucracy from their leaders. I discussed this issue with a department head at the McDonnell Douglas Company. He said, "Hey! The leaders above are extremely bureaucratic. After the plan is decided, if I have a small reform that can achieve very high efficiency, the leaders above require me to first submit a report and get approval before making any changes. The report goes up, and by the time it comes down, half a year has passed. I have another better reform plan. This time, forget it, at least another half year!" There are examples of high efficiency in Western management, but there are also examples of bureaucracy. They themselves are complaining. Do not idealize the West too much in this regard.

There is another phenomenon: Many Western scholars or Chinese scholars who have a deep understanding of Western culture often see more flaws in the West and hope to draw beneficial elements from Chinese culture and Eastern culture. They often have many words of praise for Eastern culture. At the seminar, both sides criticized their own cultural traditions and were particularly "humble." At the same time, both sides were surprised at how shallow the other side's understanding of their culture was. This is indeed an interesting phenomenon. I think, whether it is the West, the East, the United States, or China, none of them are perfect, nor are they completely worthless. We should conduct specific and practical analyses. When looking at the West and the United States, we should not only look at skyscrapers but also look behind the walls. Today, I mainly talked about problems, intending not to idealize the West too much. No matter what, we must stand on this piece of Chinese land, gradually develop ourselves, and perfect ourselves. Learn from others' strengths and make up for our own weaknesses, rather than simply imitating others. Imitating others has no future!

### 关于美国“自由”“民主”的一次座谈

专栏：

    关于美国“自由”“民主”的一次座谈
    上海空军政治学院王教员曾在美国读美国史硕士学位，尔后又曾用8个月时间考察了美国20多个州。在一堂课上，他同学员们就美国的“自由”“民主”问题进行了座谈，以亲身感受和生动的见闻剖析了美国社会所谓有“民主”、“自由”的真相，下面是座谈会上的对话。
    没有多少人听的“言论自由”
    学员：有些人认为，美国有“真正的言论自由”，比如，美国普通人都享有批评总统的“民主”权利。这些是真的吗？
    王教员：在国内确有一些人把美国的“言论自由”作了理想化的想象。我深入到美国普通人中间，发现许多美国人对他们的“言论自由”并不以为然。谁要赞扬他们“有言论自由”，他们常要反问一句：“谁听你的？”
    学员：能否举个例子来说明一下呢？
    王教员：（取出一张照片）这是我在参观白宫时，在白宫前面草坪上抓拍的一张照片。照片上这个老人在草坪旁静坐，身旁放着标语牌，上面写着：“反对里根增加军费政策！”警察虽在不远处站着，没有干涉他。但这个老人静坐了许多天，却没人理睬他。
    学员：是否可以通过新闻媒介来表示他们的意见呢？
    王教员：一般情况下，美国新闻媒介不会反映普通人的意见。就拿照片上这个老人来说，因长期无人理睬而被激怒了，最后走了极端。
    学员：是自杀了吗？
    王教员：不是。我回到学校后，在电视新闻里又看到这位老人，他开着一辆卡车停在华盛顿纪念塔下，声称卡车装满炸药，随时能炸毁纪念塔，顿时，许多记者赶到了现场，电视作了连续的现场直播。
    学员：这条新闻当时我们报纸好像也作过报道。后来并没有发生炸毁纪念塔的事，他车上并无炸药吧？
    王教员：对，他车上并无炸药。他看到新闻界来了，认为目的达到了，于是老人走出车来宣布卡车上根本没有炸药，此举目的只是为了让公众能听一听他对里根的政策的批评意见。
    学员：据说，美国的法制是很严密的，事实是这样的吗？
    王教员：美国法律条文很多，谁都引用法律条文。罪犯可以出钱请名律师辩护，钻法律条文的空子来逃脱惩罚。
    学员：美国法律条文很齐全，这是不是意味着人民群众“民主”、“自由”的权力很有保障？
    王教员：美国法律条文多，并不等于人民群众民主、自由的权力多。刚才说了，罪犯也可以钻法律条文多的空子。大家知道，美国历史上多次发生总统被刺。肯尼迪被刺，组成那么大的调查团，最终也弄了个不了了之。里根被刺的调查，也像历史上多次总统被刺的调查结论差不多，什么“个人冲动”、“精神失常”等等。美国法制对总统的保护力尚且如此，对普通老百姓民主、自由的保护力量更不能估价太高。
    巧妙编织的“客观报道”
    学员：有人说，西方新闻媒介信奉“中立”原则，一般都进行“纯客观报道”，而不在新闻中进行宣传说教。这个问题应该怎么认识？
    王教员：美国新闻媒介也受各种政治势力、利益集团所控制。它们要生存下去，不能不服从一定的利益集团。只不过美国新闻媒介宣传手段比较高明。对于他们的反共宣传，别说一般不知情的美国人会受影响，就是我国有些缺少社会经验的青年人也会在不知不觉中接受它们的观点。
    学员：你能否举一个具体例子来说明一下这种情况呢？
    王教员：比如，有一次我在美国最有影响的哥伦比亚广播公司“大陆中国”专题节目中看到这样一段录像：该公司记者访问我军华北某步兵连队。它先播出连队战士走队列、打靶等场面，使人看到我军战士昂扬的斗志，可是接下来的镜头转到了一个会场，美国记者向我们的战士提问：“你复员以后干什么？”第一个战士站起来高声回答：“服从祖国分配！”第二个战士回答说：“听从党的安排！”接着马上又叠上第三个，第四个，第五个……正当观众应接不暇想笑出声时，电视画外音缓缓地说：“请看，这就是中国大陆。在那里，人们成了机器上的螺丝钉，个人完全没有民主和自由，他们说的话是这样地千篇一律……”节目到此嘎然而止。谁会怀疑这段录相的真实性？我也相信，镜头上这些回答问题的战士，是真的。但这是不是真实地反映中国大陆的情况呢？这需要对中国大陆生活有实际的体验，加上一定的分析能力，才能得出正确的结论。我当时在美国的报告会上就对美国人说：战士的天职是报国，在那样严肃的场合，看到一批黄头发、蓝眼睛、高鼻子的美国人，肩上还扛着录像机，他们怎么同你们讨论“复员以后干什么”呢？谁知对方有何居心？同样的问题，如果是他们的未婚妻、或父母、或知心朋友所提，那么，他们也会滔滔不绝地说许多个人打算，这是人之常情，美国记者就此下结论说，中国大陆没有民主自由，就是一种片面的宣传。可见，录像录下来的东西也不等于真正的“客观报道”。
    不要把两党制理想化
    学员：有些人认为，美国的两党竞争、轮流执政很民主。这个问题应该怎么认识呢？
    王教员：美国现在的民主党和共和党的竞争局面，并不是美国人为了体现“民主原则”才搞起来的。美国宪法上没有“政党”的名词。两党制是在一定历史条件下自然形成的，美国开国时也不是两党制，开国元勋华盛顿总统一再告诫美国人：要警惕两党制的祸害，不要搞两党制。在历史发展过程中，先是出现了联邦党，后来又产生反对派，民主共和党。联邦党瓦解了，过了一段时间，产生辉格党。1854年南北战争前夕，废奴派又组成共和党。现在，资本主义国家，有两党制，也有一党制，也有多党制，这都是在一定历史条件下形成的，并不是为了体现“民主”或“独裁”的原则。对于各种情况都应作历史的分析才是正确的态度。
    学员：那么，美国的反对党是否同执政党一样享有平等权力？这里是指竞选的权力。
    王教员：并非如此。在美国除了民主党、共和党，还有其它各种小政党，这些小政党无法享有同两大党平等的竞选权力。比如美国法律规定，每个公民每年缴一元税金提供选举经费，但得不到5％选民支持的政党就拿不到这笔钱。因此，美国第三党始终发展不起来。
    学员：今天美国人是否认为他们的两党制是民主原则完善的体现呢？
    王教员：今天美国人也未必欣赏自己两党竞争的局面。我曾同一个美国人讨论两党制。他说：你们中国人千万不要把两党制理想化。一党执政也可以搞民主制，挺好的。他还说：每隔四年来一次大选，无非是靠金钱和空口诺言两张支票，绞尽脑汁拉选票，弄得你整我，我骗你。美国合法选民往往只有一半去投票。美国的“两党制”给人民的并不是当家作主的决定权，而是一种选择权，“两害相权取其轻”，如此而已。
    学员：美国有没有官僚主义？
    王教员：有。很严重哩。我在美国经常听到美国人抱怨他们的领导人官僚主义。我同美国麦道公司一个部门主任讨论过这个问题。他说：“嗨！上面领导官僚极了。方案定后，如果我有一个小小改革，可以取得很高效益。但上面规定非得先打报告经上面批准才能改动。报告上去，等批下来已半年过去，我又有一个更好的革新方案了。这次，得，别搞了，起码又是半年！”西方管理中有高效率例子，也不乏官僚主义例子。他们自己也在抱怨。这方面不要把西方看得过分理想化。
    还有另外一种现象：不少西方学者或对西方文化有较深入体验的华人学者，往往看西方弊病较多，希望从中国文化和东方文化中汲取有益的东西，他们反而对东方文化褒美之词颇多。研讨会上，双方都批判自己的文化传统，格外“谦虚”。而同时双方又对他方理解对面的文化太肤浅而大表惊讶。这实在是个有趣的现象。我认为，西方也好、东方也好，美国也好，中国也好，都不是十全十美，也不是一无是处。我们应该进行具体的、实际的分析。看西方、看美国，不光要看高楼大厦，还要看看大墙背后。今天我重点谈问题，意在不要把西方过分理想化。无论怎么说，我们总要脚踏中国这块实地，逐步发展我们自己，完善我们自己。取人之长，补己之短，而不是简单地模仿别人。模仿别人是没有前途的！
