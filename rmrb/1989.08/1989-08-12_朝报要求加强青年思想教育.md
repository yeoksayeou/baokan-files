People's Daily, Pyongyang, August 12th. Reporter Xú Bǎokāng reports: Today, the North Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* published an editorial calling on party organizations at all levels to pay special attention to the ideological education of youth, in order to thwart the current attempts by imperialists to corrupt the minds of the younger generation with bourgeois ideals, decadent culture, and lifestyles.

The editorial states that in order for youth to fulfill their responsibilities well, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education, making the youth a force that is not contaminated by "alien thoughts."

The editorial points out that the most important thing is to establish a sense of Juche aesthetics among the youth. Through ideological education, youth should understand that contributing everything for the party and revolution, subordinating personal interests to the organization and collective interests, and sacrificing oneself for revolutionary comrades is the most beautiful and noble thing.

    朝报要求加强青年思想教育
    本报平壤8月12日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表社论，号召各级党组织要对青年的思想教育给予特别关心，以粉碎当前帝国主义者企图以资产阶级人生观、颓废文化和生活方式，腐蚀年青一代思想的阴谋。
    社论说，为使青年很好的完成他们肩负的任务，必须加强思想教育，使青年队伍成为一支不受“异色思潮”污染的坚强队伍。
    社论指出，最重要的是在青年中树立主体的美学观。通过思想教育，使青年认识到，为党和革命贡献一切、个人利益服从组织和集体利益、为革命同志牺牲自己是最美好和高尚的。
