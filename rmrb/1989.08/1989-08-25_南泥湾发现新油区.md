    A new oil field has been discovered in Nanluwan, which is different from what it was in the past. Apart from having cattle and sheep everywhere, it has also discovered a new oil field. Recently, petroleum experts who returned from a survey in Nanluwan in northern Shaanxi revealed that the newly developed oil field, which has already started production, produced 658 tons of crude oil in July.

    The new oil field covers an area of approximately 5.6 square kilometers, with a reserve of 2.24 million tons. Among the 9 exploratory wells drilled, 5 oil-bearing layers suitable for extraction were found. Through trial production in 6 wells, it was shown that all have industrial extraction value. Experts believe that this oil field has a bright future and is a "treasure trove" for revitalizing the economy of Yan'an.
