Deyang City's illegal purchase of 261 small cars, totaling over 31 million yuan, has been investigated and punished. A total of 83 vehicles were confiscated, and fines were imposed on 148 vehicles. The fines and confiscated funds will be used for educational purposes. Mayor Yan Rugao received an administrative demerit.

According to investigations by relevant departments in Sichuan Province, from January to October last year, 483 various small cars were newly registered in the Deyang City Traffic Police Brigade (including a small number of used cars), with a total value of over 50 million yuan. Among these, 261 cars were purchased without approval from the Sichuan Provincial Control Office, costing over 31 million yuan. It was found that the registration of these 261 cars was either approved by relevant leaders, used public vehicles for private registration, or obtained licenses through illegal means. Among them, Mayor Yan Rugao of Deyang City exceeded his authority by approving the registration of 3 vehicles.

The "Leasing Company," "Dehai Company," and "Tenghua Company" established by the Deyang City Government, the Public Security Bureau, and other entities all engaged in illegal car trading. These companies established connections with the Traffic Police Brigade to register "black" cars, collecting handling fees and service fees totaling 500,000 yuan. The deputy director of the Deyang City Traffic Police Brigade's Vehicle Management Office, Huang Peili, demanded 8,000 yuan in bribes for registering one car. Lai Youfu from the Deyang City Light Industry Bureau received 120,000 yuan in bribes for registering a car for someone else through connections.

Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Zhi bears significant leadership responsibility for the illegal car purchases in Deyang City. Out of the 261 illegally registered cars, 106 were approved by the public security and traffic police departments under his leadership. Despite knowing about the "Tenghua Company" under the Public Security Bureau selling cars, he not only failed to stop it but also decided to forge fake documents and retrieve the seized vehicles. He received a serious party warning and an administrative demerit. Peng Youpin, the deputy chief of the Deyang City Traffic Police Brigade responsible for vehicle registration, is the direct culprit for the illegal car purchases in Deyang City. He signed the registration for 67 vehicles. Peng Youpin was expelled from the party and received an administrative demotion with retention.

    本报成都电　记者陈华报道：德阳市动用巨款违控购买261辆小汽车案件已经查清并得到处理。车辆被没收83辆，处以罚款的有148辆，罚没款收入用于教育事业。市长严如高受到行政记过处分。
    据四川省有关部门查证，去年1月至10月在德阳市交通警察支队新上户的各种小汽车达483辆（内有少量旧车），价值5000多万元以上。其中未经四川省控办批准擅自购买的261辆轿车，共花费3100多万元。据查证，这261辆小汽车的入户，都是经有关领导批准或用公车私户以及购买牌照等非法手段上户的。其中，德阳市市长严如高越权批准给3辆车上户。
    由德阳市政府批准成立的“租赁公司”、“德海公司”和公安局办的“腾华公司”等都非法经营汽车。这些公司打通与交警支队的关系，为“黑”车上户，从中收取手续费、服务费50万元。德阳市交警支队车管所副所长黄培利给车主一辆车上户竟索贿8000元，市轻纺局赖友福通过关系给他人一辆车上户受贿1.2万元。
    市公安局长张治在市小汽车违控中负有重要的领导责任，在全市违控261辆轿车中，他所领导的公安、交警部门批准上户的就有106辆，对公安局所属的腾华公司倒卖轿车，他知道后不但没有制止，还决定伪造假证件，派人取回被扣车辆，他受到党内严重警告处分和行政记大过处分。主管车辆上户的德阳市交警支队副队长彭佑品，是德阳市小汽车违控直接责任人，经他签字入户的达67辆。彭佑品被开除党籍，并受到行政开除留用处分。
