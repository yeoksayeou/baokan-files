The Tong-Ho Railway, spanning 417 kilometers, serves as the link between the Tongliao Power Plant and the Holin River Coal Mine. Over 4,000 railway workers have been toiling under extremely harsh conditions on this newly operational line for more than two years, ensuring its safe and smooth operation. Their deeds are ordinary; their spirit, however, is radiant.

Taking on the Nation's Burden on the New Line

The Tong-Ho Railway traverses grasslands, deserts, and mountains. Due to various reasons including planning and system issues, the railway was designed, constructed, and temporarily put into operation simultaneously, taking a decade to complete. By 1986, it still had many defects and did not meet the handover standards. Many stations along the line were still in a state of "five incompletes" – no electricity, water, gas, communication, or signaling.

The railway department calculated that to initially form a transport capacity, at least an additional 37 million yuan would be needed.

However, the railway workers had another set of accounts in mind. Currently, the state could not allocate more funds to the Tong-Ho line. If it were not promptly accepted and maintained, this new line might become a "mess." The Holin River Mine, built with advanced foreign equipment, and the Tongliao Power Plant had both been completed. The Northeast region was eagerly awaiting electricity, and the power plants were waiting for coal. If the railway could not be put into normal operation, the state's efforts to alleviate the energy crisis in the Northeast heavy industry base would be in vain, and the key energy base, built at great expense, would not be able to function as intended.

Complaints and grievances are of no use. After assessing the situation, the Ministry of Railways decided to fully accept the Tong-Ho Railway on December 21, 1986, at 18:00.

The order was like a mountain. On December 27 of that year, Han Diange, the director of the Tongliao Railway Bureau, led the first batch of over 400 cadres and workers, boarding a temporary special train, to enter the new line.

Where There is Hardship, There is Home

"Carrying a jar of pickled vegetables, a bag of dry rations; drinking water from a sack, opening doors with a kick (melting ice for water, pushing open frozen doors)." This folk rhyme circulates among the workers.

The workers count on their fingers: the Tong-Ho line has six major hazards: wind, snow, sand, water, wolves, and snakes. Out of the 36 stations along the line, most are "isolated stations" with no human settlements for dozens of miles around. "Yun Dian" is a small station located in the mountains of the Greater Khingan Range. It is rarely visited by people, and wolves roam freely. The 22-year-old duty officer Liang Yushan vividly recounts the story of railway workers fighting against wolves, making us shudder.

It is this young Liang who, with his family in Tongliao City, has spent the past three New Year's holidays at the small station.

"Do you not miss home?" we ask.

"How could I not miss it? My sister got married, my brother enlisted in the army, and my parents are the only ones left at home. But here, every job is crucial. If I go home, someone else can't. How can I complain to the organization about difficulties?" he says with a smile.

With this spirit, this small station, where eight out of twelve workers are Young Pioneers, has maintained a record of safety and no accidents since its acceptance, and has been named an advanced youth station by the Shenyang Railway Bureau Youth League Committee.

Track maintenance is the hardest and most labor-intensive work on the railway. Yet, the old foreman Yu Shaowu of the Zhengjiatun Track Maintenance Section has not only worked as a track maintainer all his life but also married his daughter to a track maintainer. His eldest son-in-law, Jiang Honghe, is the foreman of the Maogetu Work Area.

"Maogetu" in Mongolian means "snake nest." The name is well-deserved; as soon as spring arrives, snakes emerge from their holes and crawl into the houses, catching people off guard. In such a place, Old Yu is concerned that his son-in-law has no one to take care of him, which might affect his work. He strongly persuaded his eldest daughter to stop her salary and move her family to Maogetu to be the "logistics director" for Little Jiang. Moreover, every summer during the peak track maintenance season, this retired old worker would go to Maogetu. Every morning, Old Yu would carry a pickaxe and a lunch box onto the track, teaching by example until sunset in the desert, only returning with his son-in-law and colleagues under the setting sun. When we arrived at Maogetu, this "unofficial foreman" had already gone to another track maintenance area on the Tong-Ho line – he has another son-in-law there, who is also a foreman.

There are many similar cases of families moving from big cities and old lines to the new line on the Tong-Ho line. Baiyin Huoshuo Signal Section's signal experiment room director Li Xiangyi, along with his newlywed wife, voluntarily reported to the new line. Now, they have a "new generation of Tong-Ho people." Baiyin Huoshuo Track Maintenance Section's former section chief Sun Zhenjiang is a tiger who has carved out a career with a pickaxe. His wife, Zhang Xiuqin, originally worked at the Tongliao Station but willingly followed her husband to the new line. Little Sun did not want to let her suffer, but Zhang Xiuqin comforted her husband: "What's the big deal about hardship? Without hardship, where does sweetness come from?"

Cultivating the Tong-Ho Spirit

After more than two years of practice, the Tong-Ho Railway workers have cultivated the "hard work, strict management, and civilized construction" Tong-Ho spirit.

In the face of the current wave of commercial economy, some people advocate for "everything for money" and "if you can't get it, you're a loser!" The Tong-Ho line is located in an old, remote, poor, and border area, with income lower than that of the old line. How do they stabilize the team, unite the workers, and contribute to the nation? Huang Shivai, the party secretary of the Tongliao Railway Bureau, believes that the exemplary conduct of cadres and party members, leading by example, is the most powerful ideological and political work, and an important source of the Tong-Ho spirit.

On the Tong-Ho line, wherever there are difficulties, there are party members and cadres. In the cold winter, when the bureau leaders stoke the fire and cook, delivering bowl after bowl of hot porridge to the workers, people's hearts are warmed. When the Zhuhehua Traffic Section's 75 party members took the lead in moving and settling in the small stations, who else dared to demand to leave the line? The first section chief of this traffic section, Zhou Jixing, led a team after entering the line, helping stations along the railway solve work and living difficulties. At that time, Zhou Jixing was ill and had difficulty swallowing. After dragging his sick body through station after station, unfortunately, he was already in the late stages of esophageal cancer. He passed away at the age of 51. The workers miss this pioneering leader who endured hardship first.

The appearance of the Tong-Ho line has greatly changed. The track maintenance department has repaired the entire line twice, eliminating hidden dangers; the facilities along the line are complete and coordinated, with modern communication and signaling equipment. Train speeds have increased from 45 kilometers per hour to 75 kilometers per hour, and annual cargo volume has increased from over 100 million tons to over 300 million tons. Recently, when Shenyang Railway Bureau Director Li Daqiang inspected the work on the Tong-Ho line, he brought encouraging news: the Holin River Coal Mine's production will reach 100 million tons in 1991, the Tongliao Power Plant is expanding, and the local economy is developing rapidly. He demanded that the Tong-Ho people be prepared to welcome the arrival of large-scale transportation.

The hardworking and struggling people of Tong-Ho have been waiting for this day!

    平凡之中见精神
　　——访通霍铁路线上艰苦奋斗的工人们
    新华社记者　王启星　马义　通讯员　孟军
    通霍铁路，全长417公里，是连接通辽发电厂和霍林河煤矿区的纽带。4000名铁路工人在极其艰苦的条件下，奋战在这条运营仅两年多的新线上，维护着铁路安全畅通。他们的事迹，普普通通；他们的精神，光耀照人。
    替国分忧进新线
    通霍铁路穿越草原、沙地和山岭，由于计划、体制等多方面的原因，边设计、边施工、边临时通车，历时10载，到1986年仍存在许多缺陷，达不到交接标准。沿线许多车站还处在电、水、气、通讯、信号不通的“五不通”状态。铁路部门的同志算了一笔帐：通霍线要初步形成运输能力，至少还得再投资3700万元。
    但是，铁路职工心中还有一本帐。目前国家不可能再给通霍线拨款，如不及时接收过来，维护改造，这条新线很可能成为“烂摊子”。引进国外先进设备建设的霍林河矿区以及通辽发电厂都已相继落成，东北盼电，电厂等煤，铁路不能投入正常运输，国家为缓解东北重工业基地能源紧张局面，耗巨资重点建设的能源基地就无法发挥应有的作用。
    牢骚、埋怨于事无补。审时度势，铁道部决定1986年12月21日18点全线接收通霍铁路。
    “军令”如山。当年12月27日，通辽铁路分局韩殿阁局长带领首批抽调的400多名干部工人乘临时组成的专列开进新线。
    哪里艰苦哪安家
    “手拎咸菜罐，身背干粮袋；吃水用麻袋，开门用脚踢（背冰化水吃，冰冻封门推不开）。”职工中流传着这段顺口溜。
    工人们扳着指头数，通霍线有6大害：风、雪、沙、水、狼、蛇。全线36个站，大部分是方圆几十里没有人烟的“孤站”。“云端”是地处大兴安岭山中的一个小站。人迹罕至，野狼出没。22岁的值班员梁玉山讲述起铁路工人与野狼搏斗的故事来绘声绘色，听得我们毛骨悚然。
    就是这个小梁，家在通辽市，开线后的三个春节都是在小站上过的。
    “你就不想家吗？”我们问。
    “怎么不想，我姐姐出嫁，弟弟参军，家中只有父母二老。可这里一个萝卜一个坑，我要回家，别人就回不了家，哪能向组织叫困难呢？”说完，小梁一笑。
    靠着这股劲头，这个12名职工中有8名共青团员的小站自接收后一直保持着安全无事故的记录，被沈阳铁路局团委命名为先进青年站。
    养路是铁路上最苦最累的活。可郑家屯工务段老工长于绍武不仅自己干了一辈子养路工，还把女儿嫁给了养路工。大女婿江洪河就在毛告吐工区当工长。
    “毛告吐”蒙语是蛇窝的意思。这里名不虚传，一开春，蛇纷纷出洞往屋里爬，令人防不胜防。就这么个地方，老于头担心姑爷没人照顾，影响工作，硬是劝大女儿停薪留职，把家搬到毛告吐来给小江当“后勤部长”。不仅如此，每到夏天线路维修大忙之际，这位退休的老工长都要到毛告吐来。每天清晨老于头扛着洋镐，拎着饭盒上线路，言传身教，直到日落大漠，才和姑爷及其伙伴们踏着晚霞归来。当我们慕名赶到毛告吐时，这位“编外工长”却又上通霍线另一个养路工区去了——他还有一个女婿在那里，也是工长。
    类似这样把家从大城市、从老线搬到新线的，在通霍线扎根的大有人在。白音胡硕电务段信号实验室主任李向义当年和他新婚的妻子主动报名，双双来到新线，如今已添个“新一代通霍人”。白音胡硕工务段前段长孙振江是一员抡洋镐干出来的虎将，他的爱人张秀琴本在通辽站工作，心甘情愿随丈夫进了新线。小孙不忍带她吃苦，张秀琴反倒安慰丈夫：“苦怕啥？不苦哪来的甜！”
    培育通霍精神
    经过两年多的实践，通霍线铁路职工自己培育出了“艰苦创业，从严务实，文明建线”的通霍精神。
    在当今商品经济大潮的冲击下，有人鼓吹“一切向钱看”，“捞不着，是熊包！”通霍线地处老少边穷地区，收入比老线又不高，他们究竟靠什么稳住队伍，凝聚职工，为国家贡献、奉献？通辽铁路分局党委书记黄世纬认为，干部、党员的以身作则，率先垂范，是最有力的思想政治工作，是通霍精神形成的重要源泉。
    在通霍线上哪里有困难，哪里就有党员、干部。在数九寒冬，当分局领导盘炉搭灶，把一碗碗热稀饭送到职工面前时，人们的心是甜的。当珠斯花车务段75名党员带头搬家，扎根小站，安心工作时，谁还好意思要求离线？这个车务段第一任段长周吉兴，进线后带领一班人，沿着铁路帮助车站解决工作、生活中的困难。当时周吉兴正患病，吞食困难，待他拖着病体走完一个个车站后，不幸已是食道癌晚期，病逝时仅51岁。职工们对这位吃苦在前的创业人，说不尽地思念。
    如今的通霍线面貌大变。工务部门把公里线路全部维修了二遍，排除了隐患；沿线设施成龙配套，通讯、信号都用了现代化的设备。列车时速由45公里提高到75公里，年货运量由100多万吨增加到300多万吨。不久前，沈阳铁路局局长李大强到通霍线检查工作时，带来了振奋人心的消息：霍林河煤矿1991年产量将达到1000万吨，通辽电厂正在扩建，沿线民族经济也在飞速发展。他要求通霍人作好准备，迎接大运量的到来。
    艰苦创业、艰苦奋斗的通霍人，等的就是这一天！
