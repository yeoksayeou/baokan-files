Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 17th.

Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, accepted an interview from the Japanese *Yomiuri Shimbun* reporters' delegation in the Great Hall of the People on the afternoon of August 16th. He responded to questions from Japanese reporters regarding China's domestic and foreign affairs.

Yuan Mu said that despite some Western countries stirring up an anti-China wave after China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, China's basic assessment of the current world situation remains unchanged. China will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy.

He said that China's basic assessment of the current international situation is that, overall, the international situation is moving from tension to relaxation, from confrontation to dialogue, and that peace and development remain the two major themes of the world today. It is still possible for China to secure a relatively long period of international peace for its reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.

He said that during the recent period, some foreign hostile forces did intervene in the turmoil and rebellion in Beijing. After China suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, some Western countries distorted the facts in their public opinion guidance, criticized and condemned China politically, and harassed and sanctioned China economically. This is interference in China's internal affairs.

However, he pointed out that China's reference to foreign interference is not directed at the entire Western world, but rather at those forces that have consistently taken an anti-communist and anti-China stance. China is still willing to develop friendly relations with all countries, including Western countries, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to develop economic, trade, technological, and other exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He believes that the anti-China wave that has temporarily emerged will gradually subside and eventually disappear as the truth about China's suppression of the turmoil and rebellion becomes known and as China's domestic situation stabilizes.

He also expressed that China has noticed that some Western governments and leaders have already and are continuing to convey messages through various channels that they are willing to gradually ease relations with China.

A Japanese reporter asked whether the emphasis on strengthening the party's leadership and party building after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion means that the separation of party and government is no longer emphasized or implemented.

Yuan Mu replied that strengthening the party's leadership and party building is to ensure that the party maintains a firm and correct political direction, maintains good work styles, and maintains organizational purity. This does not contradict the separation of party and government functions.

He emphasized that an important lesson learned from the recent turmoil and rebellion is that the party's leadership and party building have been weakened. He personally believes that strengthening the construction of the Communist Party of China is to enable the party to better play three roles: First, to maintain the party's core leadership role in the country's political life, ensuring that the party and the country adhere to correct political directions and principles; second, to play a role as a fighting fortress in various government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and grassroots organizations; and third, to enable the broad masses of party members to play a pioneering and exemplary role in all aspects.

He explained that the so-called separation of party and government should more accurately be described as the separation of party and government functions. This will be beneficial for strengthening the party's leadership and party building, as well as for the government to exercise its powers and improve administrative efficiency. In the past, the party was too involved in specific administrative affairs, which was not conducive to strengthening the party's own construction, nor was it conducive to strengthening the party's political leadership and government work.

In response to questions about the nature of the rebellion and the imposition of martial law in some parts of Beijing, Yuan Mu said that the turmoil that occurred in Beijing more than two months ago was essentially a few people using terrorist methods and violent behavior to attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and the legitimate government of China, and to subvert the socialist People's Republic. This rebellion violated China's constitution and criminal law. Taking decisive measures to suppress such a rebellion is a just action that any sovereign country must take.

Yuan Mu also introduced that according to the spirit of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights signed in 1950, Chapter 1, Article 2 clearly stipulates that "defense against any person's illegal violent behavior," "for making a legal arrest or preventing a legally detained person from escaping," "for legally taking actions to suppress violence or rebellion," these are all included in the protection of human rights, and are legitimate and legal. This means that China's suppression of the rebellion is in accordance with China's constitution and laws, and also in accordance with international legal norms.

He said that the Chinese government and people believe that the rebellion that occurred in Beijing was of a counter-revolutionary nature because its purpose was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert China's socialist system. Those who committed such crimes committed counter-revolutionary crimes, and China's criminal law has clear definitions for this. However, some people in the West always regard China's suppression of the rebellion as the "suppression" of the so-called democratic movement, which is of course unacceptable to China. As for the majority of young students and other masses who participated in marches and demonstrations out of patriotic enthusiasm or ignorance, although we do not approve of some of their actions, in nature, they are completely different from the crimes of a few people.

He stressed that China does not force others to accept its views, but has always advocated that everyone, especially international public opinion, should respect the facts and should not distort the truth or spread rumors.

He said that the imposition of martial law in some parts of Beijing is the exercise of the power granted by the constitution, to quickly restore the normal order of the capital, which is legal and correct, and beneficial to the stabilization of China's situation. This has been fully proven in practice. Martial law is definitely for a limited period, but it cannot be lifted at present because it is necessary to continue to stabilize China's situation. He also said that martial law is only implemented in 8 districts of Beijing, and only in these areas, party and government key departments are strengthened and public security police are assisted to maintain order in some public places. Martial law is not the military taking over the administration of a region, which is different from the Western concept and some people's understanding. Some Western countries still insist on a claim that if China wants to resume exchanges with them, it must first lift martial law. This claim essentially means that they want China to exchange with them on the condition that China acts according to their will, which is interference in China's internal affairs. This is of course unacceptable to us. Their actions will certainly have an adverse effect on China's opening up to the outside world, but ultimately it will also be detrimental to them, and to those who are interested in China's current and potential huge market.

He said that in fact, the task of imposing martial law in some parts of the capital also includes the protection of the safety of foreign embassy areas, foreign business offices in Beijing, and foreign personnel and their residences in China.

In discussing how to resolve the issue of Fang Lizhi seeking asylum, Yuan Mu said that Fang Lizhi is currently being sheltered by the U.S. Embassy in China. The final resolution of the problem still depends on the U.S. authorities truly acting in accordance with the principles of respecting Chinese law and implementing international legal norms. The U.S. side's delay in resolving this issue, in my view, is actually giving themselves a burden.

Yuan Mu said that a reporter from the American National Broadcasting Company recently asked me whether the Chinese government would use force to arrest and bring Fang Lizhi to justice from the U.S. Embassy in China? Whether we agree to the U.S. Embassy in China sending Fang Lizhi to a third country or so-called "neutral country"? My answer at the time was: first, no, we do not need to do that; second, we do not agree, because the concept of a "neutral country" in this matter does not exist, which is fundamentally different from the concept of strictly maintaining "neutrality" during wartime for the warring parties. I also told the American reporter that if the U.S. side forcibly sends Fang Lizhi to a third country or so-called "neutral country," the country that is willing to accept it in this matter is also not "neutral," and is also mired in the quagmire of interfering in China's internal affairs. Whether there is such a country, I still express doubt.

The *Yomiuri Shimbun* reporters' delegation came to China this time for the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China. The delegation of 9 people will visit 26 cities across the country.

    袁木接受日《读卖新闻》记者组采访
    就内政外交有关问题答记者问
    ●我对世界形势基本估计没变外交政策因而也不会改变
    ●中国平息暴乱符合中国宪法和法律也符合国际法准则
    ●戒严肯定有限期出于继续稳定局势需要目前不能取消
    ●方励之避难问题美国拖而不决实际上给自己背上包袱
    新华社北京8月17日电　（记者杨子迪）国务院发言人袁木16日下午在人民大会堂接受了日本《读卖新闻》访华记者组的采访，就中国对内对外的一些问题回答了日本记者的提问。
    袁木说，尽管西方一些国家在中国发生动乱、暴乱过程中和平息反革命暴乱以后掀起了一股反华浪潮，但中国政府对当前世界形势的基本估计没有改变，中国坚持独立自主的和平外交政策因而也不会改变。
    他说，中国政府对世界形势的基本估计仍然是：总的来看，当前国际局势正从紧张趋向缓和，由对抗转向对话，和平和发展仍然是当今世界的两大主题。中国为自己的改革开放和社会主义现代化建设争取到一个较长时期的国际和平环境，仍然是可能的。
    他说，前一段时间，外国的确有些敌对势力插手了北京的动乱和暴乱。在中国平息反革命暴乱后，有些西方国家在舆论导向上歪曲事实真相；在政治上对中国进行指责和谴责，在经济上对中国进行刁难和制裁，这是对中国内政的干涉。
    但是他指出，中国所指的外国干涉并不是针对整个西方世界，而是针对那些一贯采取反共反华立场的势力而言的。中国仍然愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展同世界各国包括同西方国家的友好关系，在平等互利的基础上发展同世界各国的经济、贸易、技术等方面的交流与合作。他表示相信，一度出现的反华浪潮将随着中国制止动乱、平息暴乱的真相大白于天下，随着中国国内局势的稳定而逐步趋缓，乃至最终逐步趋于消失。
    他还表示，中国方面已经注意到，某些西方国家政府和当权人物，已经和正在通过各种渠道，透露了愿意同中国方面逐步缓和关系的信息。
    日本记者问到，中共十三大强调党政分开，而平息反革命暴乱后又强调加强党的建设和党的领导，这是否意味着党政分开不提了或不再实行了？
    袁木回答说，我们加强党的建设和加强党的领导，其目的是为了使党保持坚定、正确的政治方向，保持优良的作风，保持组织上的纯洁，这同实行党政职能分开并不矛盾。
    他强调说，从前一段时间发生的动乱乃至暴乱中，我们所得到的一条重要的经验教训就是党的建设和党的领导被淡化了，被削弱了。
    他说，我个人认为，加强中国共产党的自身建设是为了使党更好地发挥三个方面的作用：一是保持党在国家政治生活中的核心领导作用，使党和国家坚持正确的政治方向和政治原则；二是党在各级机关、团体、企事业单位和基层组织中的战斗堡垒作用；三是广大共产党员在各个方面起先锋模范作用。
    他解释说，所谓党政分开，准确地说应该是实行党政职能分开。这样做，将有利于加强党的领导和党的建设，也有利于政府行使职权和提高行政工作效率。过去党过多地陷入具体的行政事务，这不利于加强党自身的建设，也不利于加强党的政治领导和加强政府工作。
    在回答关于暴乱的性质以及有关北京部分地区实行戒严的问题时，袁木说，两个多月前北京发生的风波，实质上是极少数人采取恐怖主义的手段和暴力行为，企图推翻共产党的领导和中国的合法政府，颠覆社会主义的人民共和国。这一暴乱事件违反了中国的宪法，触犯了中国的刑律。采取果断措施平息这种暴乱，是任何一个主权国所不能不采取的正义行动。
    袁木还介绍说，根据联合国人权宣言精神于1950年签订的《欧洲人权公约》，其中第一章第二条就明确规定，“防卫任何人的非法暴力行为”，“为实行合法逮捕或防止合法拘留的人脱逃”，“为镇压暴力或叛乱而合法采取的行动”，这些都属于保护人权之列，是正当的和合法的。这也就是说，中国平息暴乱，是符合中国的宪法和法律的，也是符合国际法准则的。
    他说，中国政府和人民认为在北京发生的暴乱是反革命性质的，因为它的目的是要推翻中国共产党的领导和颠覆我国的社会主义制度。犯有这种罪行的人，犯的就是反革命罪，中国的刑法对此有明确的界定。但是西方有些人总是把中国平息暴乱看成对所谓民主运动的“镇压”，这种观点当然是中国所不能接受的。至于大多数青年学生和其他群众出于爱国热情或不明真相而参加游行示威等活动，被极少数制造动乱的人所利用，尽管我们并不赞成他们的一些行动方式，但在性质上同极少数人的罪行是完全不同的。
    他强调说，中国从不强迫别人接受自己的观点，但我们一贯主张任何人特别是国际舆论都应当尊重事实，更不应该歪曲真相甚至造谣惑众。
    他说，在北京部分地区实行戒严，是执行宪法赋予的权力，为了迅速恢复首都正常秩序，是合法的和正确的，是有利于中国局势的稳定的，实践已经充分证明了这一点。戒严肯定是有限期的，但目前还不能取消，因为这是继续稳定中国局势的需要。他还说，戒严只是在北京的8个城区实行，而且仅是在这些地区对党政要害部门加强警戒和协助公安干警维持好一些公共场所的秩序。戒严并不是由军方接管一个地区的管理，这与西方的概念和一些人的理解并不一样。有些西方国家仍在坚持一种主张，就是如中国要恢复与它们的交流，就必须首先解除戒严令。这种主张实质上是以它们与中国交往，要以中国应按外国的意志干这干那为先决条件，这是对中国内政的干涉。这当然也是我们所不能接受的。它们这样做，当然对中国的对外开放会产生不利影响，但最终也将对它们自己不利，对那些对中国这个现实的和潜在的巨大市场有兴趣的人不利。
    他说，其实，在首都部分地区实行戒严，其任务也包括对外国使馆区、外商驻京办事处和外国来华人士住处及其人身安全的保障。
    在谈到如何解决方励之的避难问题时，袁木说，方励之现在由美国驻华使馆庇护。解铃还需系铃人，问题的最后解决，还要由美国当局真正按照尊重中国法律和执行国际法准则的原则来行事。美国方面对这个问题拖着不解决，据我看，这实际上是他们自己给自己背上了一个包袱。
    袁木说，美国全国广播公司记者前不久采访我时，曾问到中国政府会不会用武力强行从美国驻华使馆将方励之逮捕归案？同不同意美国驻华使馆将方励之送到第三国或所谓的“中立国”？我当时的回答是，第一不会，我们还不需要那样做；第二不同意，因为在这个问题上的“中立国”概念是不存在的，这同战争期间对交战双方严守“中立”是根本不同的概念。我还对那位美国记者说过，如果美国方面强行将方励之送到第三国或所谓的“中立国”，愿意接受的国家在这个问题上也就不“中立”了，也就陷入了干涉中国内政的泥潭了。是否有这样的国家，我还是表示怀疑的。
    日本《读卖新闻》记者组此次是为新中国成立四十周年而来中国作采访的。记者组一行9人将分路访问全国26个城市。
