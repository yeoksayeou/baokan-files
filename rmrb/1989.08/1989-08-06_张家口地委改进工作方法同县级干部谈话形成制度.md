The Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province has consistently maintained a system of talking with county-level cadres. Over the past three years, the municipal committee leaders have held talks with more than 2,700 county (department)-level cadres, eliminating some misunderstandings among the leaders, promoting the ideological and work style construction of the leadership teams, and enhancing their cohesion.

This system has strengthened the self-discipline and self-improvement capabilities of cadres and leadership teams. For instance, the Party Committee Secretary and Director of a certain factory under the jurisdiction of the municipality had difficulty accepting different opinions from each other, which affected production and development. The municipal committee summoned them to the municipal committee meeting for collective talks, helping both parties to distinguish right from wrong, eliminate ideological misunderstandings, and create a cooperative and supportive working environment.

The system has also helped to resolve issues in their early stages. At the beginning of the year, two main leaders of a certain county had disagreements over work, leading to a situation where they did not communicate with each other. Two deputy secretaries of the municipal committee and the head of the organization department promptly went to this county, carefully understood the situation, and had face-to-face talks with these two leaders, pointing out the problems and shortcomings of each, and proposing corrective measures within a specified time. The two leaders made self-criticisms on the spot and expressed their willingness to work together to do a good job.

The system has facilitated the understanding and resolution of actual difficulties faced by cadres, thereby enhancing their work enthusiasm. Over the past year, the municipal committee has successively adjusted the housing for six cadres who are working in counties but living in Zhangjiakou City and facing severe housing difficulties.

    张家口地委改进工作方法同县级干部谈话形成制度
    本报讯　中共河北省张家口地委坚持与县级干部的谈话制度。地委领导成员3年多来先后与县（处）级领导干部谈话2700多人次，消除了一些领导成员之间的隔阂，促进了领导班子思想作风建设，增强了自身的凝聚力。
    增强了干部和班子的自我约束能力与自我提高能力。地属某工厂党委书记和厂长，相互听不进不同意见，影响生产发展。地委将他们召集到地委委员会上，集体进行谈话，帮助双方明辨是非，消除思想上的隔阂，工作中形成相互配合、支持的局面。
    将问题解决在萌芽状态。年初，某县委两位主要领导同志，因工作上的意见分歧，发展到互不讲话。地委两名副书记和组织部长及时深入这个县，认真了解情况，与这两位领导面对面进行谈话，明确指出各自存在的问题和缺点，提出限期改正意见。这两位领导当面做了自我批评，表示要通力合作搞好工作。
    便于了解和解决干部的实际困难，调动其工作积极性。去年以来，地委陆续为在县任职、家住张家口市的6名住房十分困难的同志调整了住房。
