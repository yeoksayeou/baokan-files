The reporter learned from relevant departments that the capital martial law troops recently conducted a mass inspection of discipline among the people. This inspection, conducted according to the requirements of the General Political Department and the martial law troops command, aims to further carry forward the glorious tradition of the people's army in observing discipline and loving the people, and to complete the martial law mission well.

This mass inspection of discipline among the people began in mid-to-late July. Martial law troops at the army, division, and regiment levels formed hundreds of inspection and acceptance teams, led by military leaders, and visited relevant district and county governments, agencies, enterprises, institutions, and street offices in Beijing. They widely solicited the opinions of local governments and people from all walks of life, and conducted a thorough and comprehensive inspection of the discipline observed by the troops in Beijing since the implementation of martial law. When the inspection and acceptance team of a certain unit went to Zhongshan Park for inspection, they found a stain left by a kitchen car on the cement floor. They immediately sent someone back with detergent and a broom to clean it up. The martial law troops patrolling Wangfujing Street and nearly a hundred stores conducted friendship activities, but did not take the opportunity to buy scarce and cheap goods. In the suburbs of Beijing, the martial law troops patrolling orchards and farms did not eat a single fruit from the people, no matter how hot the weather or how thirsty they were. During the period of being besieged, the people voluntarily sent some food and money, and each unit of the troops made a record and returned it item by item. For those donations that did not leave a unit name, the troops formed investigation teams to find them and return them to their original owners. The investigation teams of a certain unit found 46 units and 420 individuals who had supported the troops without leaving their names, and returned all the money and goods. For the property of the people that was damaged or lost during the patrol, the troops compensated for it at the original price.

Based on the opinions of local governments and the people, the martial law troops seriously absorbed the correct opinions and reasonable demands of the people, and formulated targeted improvement measures to promote the construction of the troops' style and discipline. To avoid affecting the work and rest of the local people, some units adjusted the time and routes for exercises and roll calls. For the few individuals who violated the discipline among the people, each unit dealt with them seriously according to the disciplinary regulations and local regulations.

    进一步发扬遵纪爱民光荣传统
    首都戒严部队开展群众纪律检查
    新华社北京8月15日电（记者赵苏、陈辉）记者从有关部门获悉，首都戒严部队最近普遍开展了群众纪律大检查。根据总政治部和戒严部队指挥部的要求进行的这次纪律大检查，旨在进一步发扬人民军队遵纪爱民的光荣传统，善始善终地完成戒严任务。
    这次群众纪律大检查是从7月中下旬开始的。戒严部队军、师、团各级组成了上百个检查组、验收组，由部队领导同志带领，分别走访了北京市有关的区、县政府、机关、企事业单位和街道办事处，广泛征求地方政府和各界群众的意见，对首都实行戒严以来部队执行群众纪律的情况认真地做了全面的检查。某部纪律检查验收组到中山公园验收时，发现部队住过的水泥地上有一块炊事车留下的污迹，立即派人带着洗衣粉、扫把回来洗刷干净。在王府井大街执勤的戒严部队和近百家商店开展了联谊活动，却从不借机购买紧俏便宜商品。在京郊一些果园、农场执勤的戒严部队，天再热，口再渴，也不白吃群众一个瓜果。戒严部队在被围困期间，群众主动送来一些食品、款项，各部队都一一造册登记，逐项做了偿还。对于那些没有留下单位姓名的赠款赠物，部队组成查访小组多方查找，物归原主。某部的8个查访小组找到了支援部队未留姓名的46个单位和420名群众，归还了全部钱物。在执勤中损坏、丢失的群众物品，部队照价做了赔偿。
    各戒严部队在广泛听取地方政府和人民群众意见的基础上，认真吸收群众的正确意见和合理要求，有针对性地制定了改进措施，促进部队的作风纪律建设。为了不影响驻地群众的工作、休息，一些部队调整了出操、点名时间和进出路线。对于极个别违犯群众纪律的官兵，各部队按照纪律条令和地方的规定，做了严肃处理。
