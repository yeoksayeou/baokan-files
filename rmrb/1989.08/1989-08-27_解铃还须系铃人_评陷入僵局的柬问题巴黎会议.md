Title: The Bell Can Only Be Unrung by the One Who Rang It

The second phase of the ministerial-level meeting of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia will be held on August 28. After three weeks of work, the various committees have made no substantive progress in preparing the final documents for the meeting. Pessimists outnumber optimists regarding the prospects for the final stage of the meeting. Today, an article in the French newspaper *Le Monde* suggests that the likelihood of the meeting reaching an agreement is very small, and people are only hoping for a miracle in the final minutes.

The goal of this Paris conference is to find, through consultations among all parties, a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian problem that can be accepted by all parties involved in the conflict. This involves forming a four-party interim joint government to facilitate the establishment of a neutral, peaceful, and independent Cambodian state through elections. However, the core issue of this conference has stalled after nearly a month of discussions.

So far, there are two opposing proposals regarding the composition of the future Cambodian government. The three resistance factions of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front have proposed establishing a four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk, with government members equally represented from all four parties. This is a plan that is conducive to national reconciliation and unity, taking into account the interests of all parties and the future of Cambodia. It is the best choice and has received broad support from the international community. Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime, on the other hand, are trying to create a different plan, attempting to form a joint government consisting of only Sihanouk and Hun Sen, effectively excluding other resistance forces and giving Hun Sen sole control. This is incompatible with the Paris conference's goal of seeking a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem. During the conference, some have tried to compromise between the two opposing plans, using the arrangement of "honorary positions" for the Khmer Rouge as a cover to exclude the Khmer Rouge. The key issue remains the maintenance of Hun Sen's sole control. People naturally ask, why can't a faction that has been resisting the Vietnamese invasion for many years participate in politics and hold power, while a puppet that is not recognized by the international community and the United Nations, and colludes with the Vietnamese invaders, not only can enter the government unchallenged but also hold sole power? The world has never seen such an unprincipled and unjust situation!

There is a Chinese proverb: "The bell can only be unrung by the one who rang it." The Cambodian problem was caused by Vietnam's military invasion, and this "bell" was rung by Vietnam itself. Therefore, the true solution to the Cambodian problem lies in Vietnam's sincerity and actions. There is no other way. It is puzzling that Vietnam, in this conference, not only failed to present a decent proposal or make necessary concessions but also, together with the Phnom Penh regime, created obstacles and even accused others of "sabotaging the international conference." Its proposal of six measures to completely exclude the Khmer Rouge is a testament to this. If these measures are implemented, they will only close the door to negotiations, which is the fundamental reason for the stalemate in this Paris conference. Meanwhile, on the eve of the second phase of the ministerial-level meeting, Vietnam has also sparked fighting on the Cambodian-Thai border, attempting to launch a full-scale offensive against the resistance forces before its withdrawal, while trying to undermine the resistance forces on both the conference and battlefield fronts. Vietnam's actions tell people that Vietnam's plan is to use the international conference to achieve its goals on the battlefield, that is, to continue occupying and controlling Cambodia. Therefore, it is clear to anyone without bias who is sabotaging the international conference.

According to reports, at this conference, Vietnam has also been causing trouble over the international supervisory body. Prince Sihanouk and the resistance forces have long advocated that the United Nations should lead and send peacekeeping forces to Cambodia. This proposal, which has been accepted by the international community and most of the participants, is opposed by Vietnam and the Hun Sen regime, who, using the excuse that the United Nations does not recognize the Phnom Penh regime, insist on excluding the United Nations from international supervision. This is unreasonable. The international supervisory body they advocate, consisting of six countries they name, has the sole purpose of excluding the United Nations and denying its role in solving the Cambodian problem.

It is clear that the two key issues to be resolved at this conference—the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops under UN supervision and the establishment of a four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk—have both been rejected and sabotaged by Vietnam.

Now, with the goodwill of resolving the Cambodian problem comprehensively, people are calling for the second phase of the ministerial-level meeting to be held. Obviously, its task is very arduous. But people believe that as long as everyone makes efforts and persists, there is still hope for a result. The key is how to induce Vietnam to change its stance. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach has said that Vietnam will change its stance. Now people want to see its actions again.

    解铃还须系铃人
    ——评陷入僵局的柬问题巴黎会议
    本报记者　张启华　吕网大
    柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议第二阶段部长级会议将于本月28日召开。各委员会经过3周的工作，在准备会议的最后文件中未取得任何实质性的进展。对最后阶段会议的前景，悲观者多于乐观者。今天，法国《世界报》发表的文章认为，会议达成协议的可能性极小，人们只是期待着会议最后一分钟出现奇迹。
    这次巴黎会议的目标，是要通过各方磋商，寻找一个全面解决柬埔寨问题、而又为冲突各方所能接受的方案。即组成一个四方联合临时政府，以便为下一步通过选举建立一个中立、和平、独立的柬埔寨国家。但近一个月的会议恰恰在这个核心问题上陷入僵局。
    迄今，在柬埔寨未来政府组成上，实际存在着两个对立的方案，民柬三方抵抗力量建议成立一个由西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府，政府成员由四方平等派员组成。应该说这是一个有利于民族和解和团结的方案，它照顾到各方的利益，考虑到柬埔寨未来的前途，是一种最佳选择，也得到国际社会广泛的支持。越南、金边政权则竭力另搞一个方案，企图炮制一个所谓西哈努克与洪森两方组成的联合政府，实质上就是要排斥其他抵抗力量，由洪森独家掌握实权。这同巴黎会议谋求全面、政治解决柬埔寨问题是格格不入的。会议期间，有人试图在两个对立的方案中折衷，以安排红色高棉“荣誉职务”为名，行排斥红色高棉之实，其要害仍是维护洪森独家掌权。人们自然要问，为什么多年抵抗越南入侵的一派不能参政、掌权，而一个不为国际社会和联合国所承认的、和越南入侵者沆瀣一气的傀儡却不仅可以让它大摇大摆进入政府，还要让它独家掌权？天下哪有这种不讲原则，不分是非的事情？！
    中国有句俗语，解铃还须系铃人。柬埔寨问题是由越南军事入侵造成的，这个“铃”是越南自己系上的。因此，真正解决柬埔寨问题，就要靠越南的诚意和行动。除此别无它路。令人难以理解的是，越南在这次会议上，不但没有拿出像样的建议，作出必要的让步，反而与金边政权一起制造障碍，甚至倒打一耙，指责别人“破坏国际会议”。它提出干净彻底排除红色高棉的6条措施，就是一个佐证。按此去办，只能使谈判大门关闭，这是这次巴黎会议陷入僵局的最根本原因。与此同时，在第二阶段部长级会议前夕，越南又在柬泰边境挑起战火，企图在撤军前夕再次向抵抗力量发动全面攻势，同时在会场和战场两条战线搞垮抵抗力量。越南的所作所为告诉人们，越南的如意算盘是想通过国际会议达到它在战场上达不到的目的，即继续占领、控制柬埔寨。因此究竟谁在破坏国际会议，这是任何不抱偏见的人都可以看清楚的。
    据报道，在这次会议上，越南还在国际监督机构上纠缠不休，制造麻烦。西哈努克亲王及抵抗力量一直主张必须由联合国领导，并向柬埔寨派出维持和平部队。这个早为国际社会和大多数与会代表所接受的建议，越南及洪森政权却以联合国不承认金边政权为借口，硬要把联合国排除在国际监督之外，这是毫无道理的。他们鼓吹的、由他们点名的6国组成国际监督机构，唯一目的就是要排斥联合国，否定它在解决柬埔寨问题中所能发挥的作用。
    事情非常清楚，这次会议要解决的在联合国监督下越南撤军以及建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府两个关键问题上，统统都被越南拒绝和破坏了。
    现在，人们本着全面解决柬埔寨问题的良好愿望，要求召开第二阶段部长级会议，显然它的任务是十分艰巨的。但人们相信，只要大家努力，坚持不懈，最后取得结果还是有希望的，关键是如何促使越南转变立场。越南外长阮基石曾表示，越南会改变立场的，现在人们愿意再次看看它的行动。
