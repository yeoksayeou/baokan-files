In Memory of Xian Yan
Xiao Ke

It has been over 40 years since Comrade Xian Yan passed away, and I still deeply miss him.

I first met Comrade Xian Yan in late October 1934, when the Red Second and Sixth Army Corps met in eastern Guizhou. Before the meeting, I had heard Bo Yibo mention that Xian Yan was from the Northeast, a Manchu, and had long been involved in youth league work. He had studied in Moscow and had recently transferred to the Hunan-Hubei-West Hunan Soviet area and the Red Army. These introductions made me quite fond of this northern comrade. After the meeting of the Second and Sixth Army Corps, under the leadership of He Long, Bo Yibo, and others, we marched towards western Hunan to establish the Hunan-Hubei-Chongqing-Guizhou border revolutionary base. Later, we embarked on the Long March, all the way to the great meeting in Shaanxi-Gansu. During this period, we traveled many roads together, fought many battles, discussed many issues, and came to know each other better.

I felt that he was a good revolutionary and leader with a strong proletarian party spirit. He was easy to get along with and approachable. He often shared interesting knowledge with me. Once, when talking about the errors of the adventurist period, he said, "Bukharin once joked about (and also criticized) our 'matchstick uprising.' He also told me about various episodes of the youth and cultural movements in big cities and about figures within the party, especially among the youth. Once, after talking about Chen Duxiu's mistakes, he spoke with a tone of praise and regret, 'Chen Duxiu's two sons are truly a pity, both like young dragons.' Although his conversations were not many, they gave me great inspiration.

He not only had a correct outlook on life but also had revolutionary emotions. Before and after the start of the War of Resistance, we both knew how to sing a few anti-war songs. He sang parts of "May Flowers" and "The Trilogy of Exile," which sounded particularly tragic. Once, when we talked about the September 18th Incident and the fall of the Three Eastern Provinces, and sang anti-war songs, I felt he had an indescribable sense of tragedy. He said, "Yes! After leaving home, I rarely thought of my hometown, but after September 18th, my mood seemed to change. Sometimes, I don't know how, a sudden inspiration, and the hometown's feelings appear before my eyes." Later, I thought, his hometown—the Northeast—had been occupied by Japan! His relatives had become slaves, and their fate was unknown. Later, I also learned that his birthday was on September 18th. This background could not help but reflect in his emotions. I once had a similar situation. In 1926, I read Hu Shi's translation of the British poet Byron's "Lament for Greece," and I was deeply moved. The entire poem of 16 stanzas was almost memorized. At that time, I read it as a literary work I liked, feeling but not deeply; after September 18th, reciting the poem's lines would evoke greater sympathy and even tears of sadness. He had me recite a few stanzas, the last two lines were, "This land of slaves is not my home, I break this cup to vow!"

I repeated these two lines, and he let out a long sigh, remaining silent for a long time.

Xian Yan was good at united front work. After the 120th Division arrived in Jinxi North, he saw the situation of the friendly parties and armies and believed that to establish Jinxi North as an anti-Japanese base, in addition to strengthening their own work, the first step was to do a good job in the united front. As the political commissar of the 120th Division and a party member, in addition to guiding the Jinxi North Party Committee to strengthen the party organization and fully mobilize the masses, he actively helped the Second War Zone War Mobilization Committee with its organization and work. Through the leftist Kuomintang member Xu Fan Ting (who later became a Communist Party member) and the secret party member Nan Han Chen, two social celebrities, he united these armies and promoted their progress. However, he made distinctions among them: for the Yan army, it was mainly about uniting and cooperating; for the Fu army, he also helped expand it; for the Death Defying Column, the Defense and Guard Brigade, and the New First Division (Xu Fan Ting served as the division commander), which appeared under the name of the united front but were led by our party, he promoted their development. In this way, the base was established and consolidated in just over half a year.

After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee, I went to work in the Suijiazhuang Advance Force, and we parted ways. It was not until May 1944 that I returned to Yan'an due to illness that we met again, but he was already seriously ill. I sometimes went to see him, but we could no longer have the free and easy conversations of the past. Not only that, but when I last saw him, he was extremely weak, as if an ominous shadow was following him. I then thought of some of his past deeds. I felt that this outstanding proletarian revolutionary and loyal communist warrior, from his youth, believed in Marxism, participated in the revolutionary movement, and used his actual actions to change China, this semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. He merged his revolutionary ideals with the peril of the Chinese nation, especially after September 18th, with his patriotic feelings. However, not long after the victory of the War of Resistance, he left the world. But it can be comforting to know that when he left, the national humiliation had been avenged, and "my land" was no longer a "land of slaves." Of course, if he could see today's society, that would be even better!

    怀向应
    肖克
    关向应同志逝世已经40多年了，他给我留下了深深的怀念。
    我和向应同志第一次见面是1934年10月下旬，是在红二、六军团于贵州东部会师的时候。会师之前，曾听到弼时同志讲向应是东北人，满族，长期做青年团工作，曾赴莫斯科学习，近几年才转到湘鄂西苏区和红军。这些介绍，使我对这位北方同志颇有好感。二、六军团会师之后，在贺龙、任弼时和他的领导下向湘西进军，建立了湘鄂川黔边革命根据地。此后举行长征，一直到陕甘宁大会师。这时期我们一起走了好多路，打了好多仗，商量好多问题，相互之间有了更多的了解。
    我觉得，他是个无产阶级党性坚强的好革命家，好领导人。同他相处，平易亲切。他常把他知道而有意思的知识告诉我。有一次谈到盲动主义时期的错误，他说：布哈林曾笑话（也是批评）我们搞“洋火暴动”。他还把大城市的青年运动和文化运动的若干情节及党内尤其青年中的人物同我讲。有一次谈到陈独秀的错误后，又以赞美而惋惜的口气说：“陈独秀的两个儿子真可惜，都像生龙活虎”。他的谈话虽然不很多，但给我启发很大。
    他不仅有正确的人生观，而且有革命情感。抗战开始前后，我和他都会唱几个抗战歌曲，他唱《五月的鲜花》和《流亡三部曲》一些段落，显得特别悲壮。有一次我们说到九·一八事变，东三省沦亡，并唱起了抗战歌曲。我觉得他有一片难以言传的悲壮感。他说：“是啊！我离家后，很少思念家乡，但九·一八后，情绪好像有点变化。有时不知怎样，灵机一闪，故乡的乡情便在眼前晃动”。后来我想，他的家乡——东北——是被日本占领了啊！他的亲属已经成了奴隶，生死未卜。后来，又知道他的生辰恰恰在九·一八那天，这种背景，不能不反映在情感上。我也曾有这种情况，1926年我读胡适翻译英国诗人拜伦的《哀希腊歌》，读后很感动，全文16段，几乎背下了。当时，是当作自己喜欢的文学作品读的，感而不深；九·一八后，背诵其中诗句就引起更大的同情心直至涌出悲伤之情了。他叫我背了几段，最后两句是“奴隶之国非吾土兮，碎此杯以自矢！”
    我把这两句重复一次，他一声长叹，良久无语。
    向应善于做统战工作，一二○师到晋西北后，他看清了友党友军的情况，以为要把晋西北建立为抗日根据地，除加强本身工作外，首先是作好统一战线工作。他以一二○师师政委和党员身份，除指导晋西北区党委加强党的组织和充分发动群众外，积极帮助第二战区战地总动员委员会的组织和工作的开展。他通过国民党左派续范亭（后成为共产党员）及秘密工作党员南汉辰两位社会名流，团结这些军队，推动他们进步。但对他们又有区别，对阎部主要是团结联合，对傅部还帮助其扩大，对以统一战线名义出现而由我党领导的决死纵队，工卫旅及新编第一师（续范亭兼任师长），则促其发展。这样，只半年多根据地就建立和巩固起来了。
    六届六中全会后，我去冀热察挺进军工作，我们分开了，直到1944年5月我因病回延安才见面，然而，他已重病了。我有时去看他，但再也不能像过去那样畅情长谈了。不仅不能，在我最后看他的时候，他极为虚弱，似乎有不祥的阴影伴着他。我就想到他过去一些事。我觉得这位杰出的无产阶级革命家，忠诚的共产主义战士，他从青年起就信仰马克思主义，参加革命运动，用自己的实际行动来改变中国这个半殖民地、半封建社会。他把自己的革命理想同中国民族的危亡，尤其在九·一八后的爱国之情，溶合起来了。可是，抗战胜利不久，他就离开了人世。但也可以告慰，他离世的时候，国仇已复，“吾土”已非“奴隶之国”了。当然，如果他能看到现在的社会，那该多好啊！
