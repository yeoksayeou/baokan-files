The People's Daily, Chengdu, August 12th - Reporter Luo Maocheng reports: Sichuan Province's Da County has employed a risk competition mechanism to publicly bid for the directors of agricultural service cooperatives, providing new experience in improving the dual management responsibility system of household contract management and collective unified management in rural areas.

In recent years, the leaders of Da County have discovered in practice that the lack of corresponding economic organizations at the village level has led to the loss of original collective property, resource destruction, and no collective accumulation. Because the collective has no money, it cannot handle matters that individual households cannot or do not want to handle, such as water conservancy, plant protection, disease prevention, mechanized farming, and collective enterprises, which have not been well managed. To further tap the potential of household contract management and collective unified management, Da County has transformed the original production teams into agricultural service cooperatives. For the selection of directors, the previous practice of "leaders nominating and the masses circling" has been changed to open bidding.

The specific method is as follows: candidates must base their bids on the five comprehensive indicators of "grain, money, people, culture, and governance" determined by the cooperative, write their own bid books and implementation plans, and give speeches and defend their bids at the public bidding meeting. The evaluation committee, composed of village cadres and community representatives, scores the bids, and community members vote in a public opinion poll. The final winner becomes the director and legal representative. The term of the director is generally two years. The director also serves as the group leader, responsible for forming the management committee, signing contracts with farmers on behalf of the cooperative, exercising the powers of management coordination, production services, and asset accumulation; externally representing the cooperative in economic activities, and protecting the legal rights and interests of the collective and community members. The winning director implements risk mortgages, with personal income linked to the achievement of the bid targets.

By the end of last year, more than 90% of the service cooperatives in Da County had selected directors through bidding. The newly elected directors have integrated duties, responsibilities, and rights, understand economics, are good at management, are supported by the masses, and are willing to work. In the places where they have taken office, generally, the collective economy has been strengthened, and the rural atmosphere has changed. According to statistics, last year, Da County added 6,200 new collective economic projects at the village and cooperative levels, transferred 35,000 laborers, and increased collective economic income by 84.9% compared to the previous year. This year, the total rural economic income reached 7.63 billion yuan, an increase of 12.1% over the previous year. Since last winter and this spring, basic farmland construction has been carried out solidly. The work that rural grassroots cadres used to find difficult, such as grain collection and family planning, has improved significantly. The contracted grain and oil and collective levies have been delivered and collected on time. Civil disputes have decreased by 29.45%, with the vast majority resolved within the cooperative. The birth rate has decreased from 16.96‰ last year to 14.44‰, and the entire rural work is full of vitality.

### 完善农村责任制的新经验  达县招标竞选农业服务社社长

    完善农村责任制的新经验
    达县招标竞选农业服务社社长
    本报成都8月12日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省达县运用风险竞争机制，公开招标竞选农业服务社社长，为完善农村家庭分散经营和集体统一经营的双层经营责任制提供了新鲜经验。
    近年来，四川达县领导在实践中发现，村级以下机构缺乏相应的经济组织，以致原有的集体财产散失，资源破坏，集体没有积累。由于集体没钱，对一家一户办不了、办不好的事，如水利、植保、防疫、机耕、集体企业等未能很好抓起来。为进一步挖掘家庭联产承包和集体统一经营的潜力，达县把原来的生产队改为农业服务社。对社长的产生，改变过去那种“领导定名单，群众划圈圈”的任命做法，而是实行公开招标竞选。
    其具体做法是：竞选者必须根据本社确定的“粮、钱、人、文、治”五项综合指标作为标的，写出自己的标书和实施办法，在公开招标会上演说、答辩，经村干部和社员代表组成的评委会评分，社员民意测验投票，最后确定谁中标。中标人即为社长、法人代表。社长任期一般两年。社长与村民小组长实行一身二任，负责组成管理委员会，对内代表服务社与农户签订承包合同，行使管理协调、生产服务、资产积累职能的权力；对外代表服务社进行经济交往，保护集体和社员的合法权益。中标社长实行风险抵押，个人收入与实现标的实绩挂钩。
    截至去年底，达县农村90％以上的服务社通过招标选出了社长。新当选的社长职、责、权三位一体，懂经济，善经营，群众拥护，自己愿干。在他们上任的地方，一般来说，集体经济有所增强，农村风气有所变化。据统计，去年，达县村、社两级新增集体经营项目6200多个，转移劳力3.5万多人，集体经营收入比上年增长84.9％。今年，农村经济总收入达7.63亿元，比上年增长12.1％。去冬今春以来，农田基本建设搞得扎扎实实。过去农村基层干部感到头痛的催粮催款、计划生育等工作大为改观。合同定购的粮油和集体提留基本按时交售、收齐。民事纠纷下降29.45％，其中绝大部分在本社就地解决。人口出生率由上年的16.96‰下降为14.44‰，整个农村工作充满生机。
