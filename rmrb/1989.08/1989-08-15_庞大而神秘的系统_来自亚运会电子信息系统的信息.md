    A Vast and Mysterious System
    – Information from the Asian Games Electronic Information System

    The Los Angeles Olympics saw the debut of a brand-new electronic information system, which, along with the excellent organizational skills of Auberon, was hailed as one of the most noteworthy achievements of the Games.

    Since then, this electronic information system, which integrates modern computer and communication technologies, has become an indispensable tool for organizing large-scale international comprehensive sports events. South Korea, with its strong economic power, spent a significant amount of money to purchase the patent from the Americans and made some improvements, making the electronic information system for the Seoul Olympics even more advanced than that of Los Angeles.

    The Beijing Asian Games Organizing Committee also decided to establish an electronic information system. But how to go about it? If they were to buy a ready-made system, just the software alone would cost over 4 million US dollars. After much deliberation, the committee decided not to buy the patent but to develop it themselves.

    The design task was entrusted to the Beijing Software Technology Development Center. A group of young scientists, averaging around 30 years old, took on the responsibility. They thought: while China may lack money, it certainly does not lack spirit and capability. After a year and a half of hard work, they have recently made the electronic information system take shape. The leader of the design team, Professor Wang Jizhong, recently accepted an interview with a reporter and said: "These young people are truly outstanding. During the turbulent period of April, May, and June, when the design and debugging tasks were at their most intense, not a single member of the design team put down their work to participate in any protests. When transportation was disrupted, the young men would eat and sleep in the office, working day and night to complete the task. If this is not true patriotism, then what is?"

    Wang Jizhong said that some foreign experts recently came to visit and were astonished to see that in such a short time, we had developed an electronic information system with our own unique features.

    He introduced that our system consists of 3 mainframes and 384 terminals. The mainframes are "fault-tolerant" super-minicomputers donated by an American company; the terminals, distributed across various venues in the city, the Organizing Committee, and the Asian Village, are microcomputers donated by the Chinese Great Wall Computer Company; the entire system is connected through optical fiber cables and other communication lines to form a large computer network. During the Asian Games, this system will provide fast and accurate services such as results bulletins, various information queries, medal statistics, and electronic mail. For example, within 5 to 15 minutes after the end of each match in the 27 competition events, reporters from various countries and officials, coaches, and team members from various delegations can obtain complete results from the terminals. The design and application of such a large-scale computer network is a first in the country.

    Professor Wang Jizhong confidently told the reporter: "The system we designed ourselves is not only not inferior to the one used in last year's Olympics, but it also has more functions and is more convenient to operate. It has both Chinese and English displays, with the option to choose either. Because we completed the design and installation ahead of schedule, we have more than a year of ample time for testing and adjustments, making it more perfect. When the time comes, this electronic information system will provide satisfactory and efficient services for all participants of the Asian Games."

    庞大而神秘的系统
    ——来自亚运会电子信息系统的信息
    洛杉矶奥运会上首次出现了一种崭新的电子信息系统，它同尤伯罗思出色的组织能力被列为此次奥运会最值得夸耀的东西。
    从此，这种集现代计算机和通信技术于一体的电子信息系统，成了组织大型国际综合运动会不可少的一种工具。南朝鲜经济实力雄厚，不惜重金从美国人手里买来专利，又稍加改进，使汉城奥运会的电子信息系统比洛杉矶更为先进。
    北京亚运会组委会也决定设立一套电子信息系统。可是怎么搞呢？如果买现成的，光一套软件，美国人就开价400多万美金。经过几番周折，组委会决定不买专利，自己搞。
    设计任务落到北京软件技术开发中心，一批平均年龄仅30岁上下的青年科技工作者担起重任。他们想：中国人缺钱，但是并不缺志气和能力。他们经过一年半的奋战，最近已使电子信息系统初见眉目。设计组领头人王继中教授近日接受记者采访时说：“这批青年人真是好样的，4、5、6月那一段动乱期间，正是设计调试任务最紧张的时候，设计组没有一个人放下工作参加什么游行。交通中断了，小伙子们就吃住在办公室，不分昼夜地抓紧干。要说爱国主义这才是真正的爱国主义。”
    王继中说，前些天一些外国专家前来参观，看到我们在这样短时间内就搞出有自己特点的电子信息系统，十分惊讶。
    他介绍说，我们的这套系统由3台主机和384台终端机组成。主机是美国一家公司赞助的“容错”型超小型机；分布在全市各场馆及组委会、亚运村等处的终端机是中国长城计算机公司赞助的微机；整个系统通过光纤电缆等通信线路组成一个计算机大网络。亚运会期间，这套系统将又快又准地提供成绩公报、各种有关资料查询、奖牌统计、电子邮件等多项服务。例如，27个比赛项目每一项每一场比赛结束后5分钟至15分钟，各国记者和各代表团官员、教练员便可从终端机上得到完整的成绩资料。像这样大规模计算机网络的设计和应用，在国内尚属第一次。
    王继中教授带着充满信心的口气告诉记者：“我们自己设计的这套系统不仅不比去年奥运会的那套差，而且功能更全，使用操作更为简便。有中、英文两种文字显示，任意选择。由于提前完成了设计安装，我们有一年多充足的时间进行试用、调整，使它更加完善。到时候这套电子信息系统将为亚运会所有参加者提供满意而高效的服务。”
