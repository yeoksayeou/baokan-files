The first Hongqi sedan was born in 1958. The emblem on the front of the car was not a red flag but a dragon. Chairman Mao Zedong rode in this car, and subsequently, it was stipulated that the Hongqi sedan was to be used only by officials at the level of minister (or provincial governor) and above, and by commanders and political commissars of large military regions.

The Hongqi sedan was more than just a car; to the common people, it represented a status, the highest political rank.

The decoration of the Hongqi sedan also reflected political symbolism. Initially, each side of the car was adorned with one red flag, later changed to five, and then to three. The meaning behind one flag and five flags is now hard to recall, but everyone agrees that the three flags represent the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

Around 1980, the production of Hongqi sedans at the First Automobile Works in Changchun began to slow down. At that time, supply exceeded demand, with 200 cars in stock. From 1958 to 1980, a total of 1,800 Hongqi sedans were produced. At that time, the price of one Hongqi sedan was 40,000 yuan, but the cost was 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Producing one car meant losing money on one car. The sedan division had to rely on the main factory, and the Hongqi sedan relied on the Jiefang truck.

The cessation of Hongqi sedan production was mentioned in a notice from the State Council in 1983, which cited high fuel consumption. That same year, the Central Committee meeting in Beidaihe formally decided to stop producing the Hongqi sedan.

At that time, in addition to high fuel consumption, people also complained that the Hongqi sedan had a low speed, slow start, and was not suitable for high-speed roads when used by foreign embassies. The speedometer of the Hongqi sedan indicated a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour, but people said it could only reach 170 kilometers per hour. Some drivers said that the Hongqi sedan was discontinued because many leaders' homes were in narrow alleys, and the wide and heavy Hongqi sedan was inconvenient to drive.

After the Hongqi sedan was discontinued, the sedan division of the First Automobile Works changed to producing 19-seat high-end tourist cars, which were produced until 1987, totaling more than a thousand vehicles. The factory that used to produce the Hongqi sedan now has a Volkswagen Audi car assembly line from West Germany, with plans to produce 30,000 cars annually starting in 1992.

After being out of favor for many years, what happened to the Hongqi sedan? Now, many Hongqi sedans have been assigned to lower-level government agencies, and some have even ended up in the hands of individual entrepreneurs. An individual entrepreneur in Hubei Province acquired a Hongqi sedan through various channels. It was smooth sailing on the streets, but when it came to registering with the industrial and commercial and traffic departments, it caused a lot of trouble for the officials: can individuals own a Hongqi sedan?

The workers at the sedan division of the First Automobile Works have not forgotten the Hongqi sedan and believe that it will regain its former glory. Last year in August, they built a new factory building of 3,672 square meters. Indeed, in March and April of this year, they received orders from higher authorities to resume production of the Hongqi sedan.

They wasted no time. The First Automobile Works has decided to produce 10 new Hongqi sedans by October 1.

There are rumors that the Hongqi sedan has undergone significant improvements. There are also rumors that the internal components of the Hongqi sedan are all imported, with only the Hongqi shell. However, a deputy manager of the China Automobile Industry Association said that the Hongqi sedan has not undergone any new improvements and will first resume production. An engineer from the First Automobile Works office in Beijing firmly denied that the Hongqi sedan has foreign parts: "The Hongqi is the Hongqi, how could it use foreign parts? The Hongqi may be a bit slow, but given the current road conditions in our country, being able to travel at 120 kilometers per hour is enough."

    红旗轿车兴衰记
    第一辆红旗轿车诞生于1958年，车前标志不是一面红旗，而是一条龙。这辆车由毛泽东主席乘坐，其后规定，红旗轿车只供正部（省）级和大军区司令员政委以上的首长乘坐。
    红旗轿车不仅仅是车，在老百姓看来，她更是一种身份，是最高的政治规格。
    红旗轿车的装饰也体现着政治。最初，车体两侧各饰有一面红旗，后改为五面，又改为三面。这一面和五面红旗各寓有什么政治含意，今人已说不大清了，但对三面红旗，大家众口一辞：它代表着总路线、大跃进、人民公社。
    1980年前后，长春第一汽车厂轿车分厂的红旗轿车生产渐缓下来。当时供大于求，库存200辆。1958年到1980年这22年中，共生产红旗轿车1800辆。当时，一辆红旗轿车售价四万元，成本却有八九万元，生产一辆赔一辆。只好轿车分厂“吃”总厂，红旗轿车“吃”解放卡车。
    红旗轿车停产见诸1983年国务院的一份通知，提到了红旗轿车油耗高。同年中央北戴河会议，正式决定停产红旗轿车。
    当时，红旗轿车除油耗高外，人们还反映其车速低、起动慢，驻外使馆使用时不适于高速公路。红旗轿车车速盘上标明最高时速是200公里，但人们说最多跑170公里。有的司机说，红旗轿车停产是因为许多首长家处深巷，而红旗轿车身宽体重，行走不便。
    红旗轿车停产后，一汽轿车分厂曾改产19座的高级旅游车，到1987年停产共制造了千余辆。当年生产红旗轿车的厂房，如今已铺起了一条西德大众汽车公司的奥迪轿车组装线，计划1992年出车，年组装30000辆。
    失宠多年，红旗轿车怎么样了？眼下，许多红旗轿车已下归较低级的机关单位，有的甚至跌入个体户的怀抱。湖北一个体户辗转买了台红旗轿车，过市闯街倒是畅通无阻，但到了工商交通部门办牌可难坏了官员们：私人也能拥有红旗轿车吗？
    一汽轿车分厂的工人可没忘了红旗轿车，相信红旗轿车还会重振雄风。去年8月他们又盖了3672平方米的新厂房。果然，今年3、4月间，接到上级命令，恢复红旗轿车生产。
    说干就干。一汽已决定，10月1日前一定拿出10辆新红旗轿车。
    有传闻，红旗轿车已有很大改进。还有传闻，红旗轿车里面的机件都是进口的，只是搭了一个红旗的壳。而中国汽车工业联合会一位副经理说，红旗轿车基本没有新的改进，先恢复生产再说。一汽驻京办事处的一位工程师则坚决否认红旗轿车有外国机件：“红旗就是红旗，怎么会用外国件？红旗是慢了点，但就我国现有的公路条件，能跑120公里就行了。”
