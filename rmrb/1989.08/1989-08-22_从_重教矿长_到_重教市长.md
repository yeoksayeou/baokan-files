Within a year, from August 1988 to August 1989, Xu Zhonghe, the mayor of Ruzhou City in Henan Province, effectively addressed the three major issues plaguing the city's education system: dilapidated school buildings, insufficient funds, and poor treatment of contract teachers.

Xu Zhonghe, now 48 years old, began his career as a coal miner. From 1984 onwards, he successively served as the director of Lianguan Coal Mine and the director and party secretary of Lianguan Mining Bureau in Pingdingshan City, Henan Province. Over four years, the mine allocated over 10 million yuan to build new school buildings, significantly improving educational conditions. To address the shortage of teachers, he recruited 52 college graduates for the schools, promoted 21 outstanding teachers, and resolved the issue of 31 teachers being separated from their families, converting their spouses' rural household registrations to urban status. People praised him as the "education-focused mine director."

In August 1988, Xu Zhonghe became the mayor. Soon after, he received a letter written on cigarette paper by a primary school student, which read: "Dear Mayor Xu, please come and save us! Hundreds of us students are studying in classrooms that are about to collapse..." Xu Zhonghe summoned the head of the education bureau and together they visited the school and inspected 16 primary and secondary schools in six counties. He discovered that the city's education funds were severely inadequate, with over 750 classrooms in 600 schools in danger of collapse, and 380,000 yuan in unpaid wages for contract teachers...

Xu Zhonghe had the television station record the dire state of education in the city and broadcast it publicly. At meetings with county and township leaders, he passionately declared, "Can we be at ease knowing that children are studying in classrooms that are about to collapse?" He demanded that each county and township immediately address the issue of dilapidated classrooms.

"Save the children, increase investment in education" became a hot topic of discussion among the people of Ruzhou. After half a year of hard work, all 751 dilapidated classrooms in the city were demolished, replaced by rows of newly built school buildings.

When drafting the 1989 budget for the city, Xu Zhonghe insisted that education should not be compromised, increasing the education budget from 6.4 million yuan in 1988 to 8.2 million yuan, a 26.9% increase. In May, the provincial education department required Ruzhou City to accelerate the construction of primary and secondary school laboratories. The education bureau leaders, knowing the city's financial constraints, hesitated to request additional funds during their work report. Xu Zhonghe, after listening to the report, immediately called the finance bureau, instructing them to find a way to allocate an additional 1.5 million yuan for education. He assured the education bureau, "Don't worry, if the finance bureau has difficulties, I will personally seek loans from other sources."

The city government signed responsibility contracts with each county and township. Xu Zhonghe emphasized the importance of universal education, improving educational conditions, and enhancing teachers' welfare, gradually addressing the long-overdue wages for contract teachers. He also allocated all 15 of his rural-to-urban conversion quotas to teachers. Thus, the people of Ruzhou City began to call him the "education-focused mayor."

### 从“重教矿长”到“重教市长”

    从“重教矿长”到“重教市长”
    楚扬
    从去年8月到今年8月，短短一年时间，河南省汝州市长徐中和便使困扰该市教育事业发展的“危房多、经费少、民办教师待遇差”三大难题得到了较好解决。
    徐中和今年48岁，矿工出身，从1984年起先后担任河南省平顶山市梨园煤矿矿长、梨园矿务局局长兼党委书记。4年间，矿上拨出100多万元建起新校舍，改善了办学条件。师资力量薄弱，便为学校引进52名大中专毕业生，并为21名贡献大的教师晋升工资，为31名教师解决了夫妻两地分居，办理了家属“农转非”。人们称赞他是“重教矿长”。
    去年8月，徐中和担任市长。不久，他收到一封小学生用卷烟纸写来的信，信中说：“敬爱的徐市长，快来救救我们吧！我们几百个同学天天都在快要倒塌的教室里上课……”徐中和叫来教育局负责人，一同驱车下乡，实地考察了那个学校，同时又考察了6个乡的16所中小学。他了解到，全市教育经费严重不足，600多所中小学危房竟达750多间，拖欠民办教师工资达38万元……
    徐中和让电视台把全市教育面临的困境录下像来，公开播映。在各乡镇、局、委负责人会议上，他大声疾呼：“孩子们坐在摇摇欲坠的房子里上课，我们的心能好受吗？！”他要求各乡镇立即着手，限期解决危房问题。
    “救救孩子，增加教育投入”，一时成为汝州人街谈巷议的热门话题。经过半年时间的艰苦努力，全市751间学校危房全部消灭，取而代之的是一排排新修的校舍。
    在编制1989年全市财政预算时，徐中和宁愿让别的部门压缩一下，也不让教育受委屈，把教育经费由1988年的640万元增加到820万元，增长率为26.9％。今年5月，省教委要求汝州市加快中小学实验室建设。教育局领导明知市财政紧张，在汇报工作时不好意思提要钱的事。徐中和听完汇报，立即打电话，要求财政局想尽办法为教育增拨15万元经费。他对教育局负责人说：“你们放心，如果财政局有困难，我出面到别处借款。”
    市政府与各乡镇签定责任书，徐中和要求把普及教育、改善办学条件、提高教师待遇作为重要内容，使长期拖欠的民办教师工资逐步兑现。他还把手中掌握的15个农转非指标全部给了教师……于是，汝州市群众又把他称为“重教市长”。
