The Zhongyuan Oil Field is located at the junction of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, with the current development area centered around Puyang in Henan. The geology here is extremely complex, with small fault blocks—over 80% are 0.5 square kilometers or less; numerous faults—drilling a well often encounters five or six faults; deep oil and gas deposits—usually around 3000 meters, with some reaching 4000 to 5000 meters; and low porosity and permeability—these parameters are tens of times lower than in oil fields with better geological conditions.

However, despite the extreme difficulty in exploration and development, the oil field has seen an average annual increase of over 700,000 tons of crude oil production in the past decade, with the growth rate leading all oil fields in the country. Last year, Zhongyuan reached a new level: producing 7.2 million tons of crude oil and over 500 million cubic meters of natural gas annually. It has become the "Fourth Largest Oil Field" after Daqing, Shengli, and Liahe. What is the secret? Lin Qi, the Party Committee Secretary of the Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, said that Deng Xiaoping emphasized that "science and technology are the primary productive forces," which is also the key to the "Fourth Largest Oil Field" mystery. During the interview, the reporter felt that from the leaders to the workers, there is a consensus: without pursuing technological progress, one will inevitably fall behind and be beaten.

"Science and technology are the pillars that keep an enterprise thriving,"—Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau Director Jin Yu'an emphasized this point during a conversation with the reporter. He counted on his fingers: When talking about the vitality of an enterprise, it essentially boils down to three things: having advanced and applicable products, having advanced processing methods and testing tools, and having the ability to continuously develop new products. These three aspects are all permeated with science and technology. In 1983, our exploration results in the Baimiao area showed that the oil and gas layers did not meet the industrial oil flow standard. Last year, we focused on fracturing technology, and the controlled oil reserves in the Baimiao area are several times those of 1983. This five-year transformation was achieved through the promotion and application of new technologies. Looking at the oil field development situation, the Zhongyuan Oil Field No. 2 Factory used 41 submersible pumps imported from abroad in 1986, increasing crude oil production by 540,000 tons in two years, achieving an economic value of over 71 million yuan, and recovering the entire investment for these imported submersible pumps in just 83 days.

Data shows that in developed countries, the contribution of technological progress to production growth is over 50%, and in some high-performing enterprises, it reaches 70%. In China, the input-output ratio of scientific and technological loans is 1:3.7, and the input-output ratio of promoting major scientific and technological achievements is as high as 1:10, which is far higher than the 1:1.1 input-output ratio of fixed asset investments.

The Zhongyuan Oil Field Party Committee often uses such concrete data to educate everyone to prevent the tendency of emphasizing external expansion over internal content and basic construction over technological transformation in their work. Whoever has a higher awareness of science and technology, stronger sensitivity to technological progress, and faster speed in developing and promoting new technologies, the Party Committee will support them. Once, the deputy director of the Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau in charge of scientific and technological work, Che Zhuoru, decided to import a batch of new-type drill bits from abroad after careful consideration. Some comrades, not being as thorough as Che Zhuoru in weighing the pros and cons, were somewhat concerned about whether it was worthwhile. The Party Committee firmly supported Che Zhuoru's decision. Someone did the math: this move saved the Zhongyuan Oil Field tens of millions of yuan in drilling costs: firstly, this new-type drill bit has performed exceptionally well in Zhongyuan, with one drill bit able to drill four times, reaching a depth of over 3670 meters; secondly, just as this batch of new-type drill bits was delivered to Zhongyuan, their price on the international market soared.

The oil field workers insist on technological progress, carrying out technical cooperation and exchanges with over 40 countries and regions, utilizing foreign capital to introduce over 4000 sets of equipment; sending over 500 engineering and technical personnel abroad for inspections; and inviting over 5000 foreign experts to serve in the oil field. Now, the exploration and development technology of the Zhongyuan Oil Field has reached the level of the late 1970s and early 1980s internationally; the new increased geological reserves of oil and exploration benefits in the Zhongyuan Oil Field rank third among nearly 20 oil fields in the country.

### “油老四”靠的是科技进步——中原油田采访札记

    “油老四”靠的是科技进步
     ——中原油田采访札记
    本报记者　鹿舫
    中原油田位于冀鲁豫三省交界处，目前开发的地区以河南濮阳为中心。这里地质构造十分复杂，断块小——0.5平方公里的断块占8成以上；断层多——钻一口井会碰到五六个断层；油气埋藏深——一般都在3000米，深的达四五千米；孔隙度和渗透率很低——其参数比地质条件好的油田差几十倍。
    然而，就是这样一个勘探开发难度极大的油田，近十年来原油产量平均每年递增70多万吨，增产幅度居全国各油田之首。去年中原上了个新台阶：年产原油720多万吨、天然气5亿多立方米。成了居大庆、胜利、辽河油田之后的“油老四”。秘诀何在？中原石油勘探局党委书记林洽开说，邓小平同志强调过，“科学技术是第一生产力”，这也是“油老四”之谜。记者在采访中感受到，这里，从领导到职工，有一种感觉，不追求科技进步必然落后挨打。
    “科学技术是保持企业长盛不衰的支撑点”，——中原石油勘探局局长金毓荪与记者交谈时很强调这一点。他扳着手指说：讲某个企业生命力旺盛，无非是因为它一有先进的适用的产品，二有先进的加工方法和检测手段，三有不断开发新的产品的能力。这三条无一不渗透着科学技术。1983年，我们在白庙地区的勘探结果表明，那里的油气层达不到工业油流标准。去年我们一抓压裂技术，在白庙地区控制的石油储量是1983年的好几倍。五年巨变靠的不就是新技术的推广应用么？再从油田开发情况看，中原采油二厂1986年利用从国外引进的41台电潜泵，两年增产原油54万吨，实现经济价值7100多万元，83天就收回了进口这些电潜泵的全部投资。
    有资料表明，世界上发达国家科技进步在生产增长中占的因素均在50％以上，在一些效益好的企业中，则达到70％。我国科技贷款的投入产出比为1∶3.7，推广重大科技成果的投入产出比则高达1∶10，这远远高于1∶1.1的固定资产投入产出比。
    中原油田党委常用这类实打实的材料教育大家在工作中防止出现重外延、轻内涵；重基本建设、轻技术改造的倾向。谁对科学技术的觉悟高，科技进步的敏感性强，开发和推广新技术的速度快，党委就支持谁。一次，中原石油勘探局主管科技工作的副局长车卓吾在审时度势之余，决计从国外引进一批新型钻头，有些同志由于未能像车卓吾本人那样反复权衡利弊，不免有些担心是否合算。党委坚决支持车卓吾的决策。有人算了两笔帐，此一举使中原油田节约钻井成本数十万元：其一，这种新型钻头在中原屡建奇功，一只钻头能下井四次，打进尺3670多米；其二，这批新型钻头刚运进中原，它在国际市场上的价格就扶摇直上。
    油田职工坚持科技进步，先后同40多个国家（地区）开展技术合作和技术交流，利用外资引进设备4000多台（套）；派出500多人次的工程技术人员出国考察；邀请5000多人次的外国专家来油田服务。现在，中原油田的勘探开发技术已经达到国际七十年代末八十年代初的水平；中原油田的新增石油地质储量和勘探效益在全国近二十个油田中名列第三。
