    AIDS Will Create a Generation of Orphans

    In recent years, the number of AIDS patients in the United States has been increasing. According to statistics, the total number of cases has reached more than 97,000, of which over 56,000 have already died. AIDS has not only become the "number one killer" in the United States today but has also caused many serious social problems. The most worrying issue is that it has turned tens of thousands of children into a generation of orphans.

    According to the _International Herald Tribune_, the number of children in the United States who have lost their parents to AIDS is increasing. In New York City alone, there are between 50,000 and 100,000 such children. Moreover, many of them have also contracted the AIDS virus. Those who have not contracted the virus also face a tragic fate, as many will become orphans. The New York City Department of Health predicts that by 1995, there will be 20,000 orphans in need of adoption. However, most Americans are afraid of AIDS and are unwilling to adopt children of AIDS patients. According to reports, in the next three years, 300,000 to 485,000 people in the United States will contract AIDS, and a "generation of orphans" may appear in the United States.

    艾滋病将造成一代孤儿
    近年来，美国的艾滋病患者不断增加，据统计，到目前为止，已达9.7万余人，其中5.6万多人已经死亡。艾滋病不仅成为当今美国的“头号杀手”，而且引起了许多严重的社会问题。最令人担心的是它使成千上万的孩子沦为一代孤儿。
    据美国《国际先驱论坛报》报道，目前美国被艾滋病夺去父母生命的孩子人数越来越多，仅纽约城一地，就达5万到10万人。而且，他们中间许多人也染上艾滋病毒。没有染上这种病毒的也面临可悲的命运，因为不少人要沦为孤儿。纽约市卫生部门预测，到1995年，将有2万名孤儿需要收养。然而，大多数美国人对艾滋病唯恐躲之不及，怎么愿意领养艾滋病患者的孩子呢？据报道，在今后3年内，美国将有30万至48.5万人染上艾滋病，“孤儿的一代”很可能会在美国出现。        　（胡白）
