	The Magic of Information

	Currently, private detectives in the United States are extremely busy. Many single men are seeking their help to investigate the background and whereabouts of potential marriage partners.

	According to the owner of a private detective agency, Vincent Peko, his agency's detectives were hired to conduct such investigations more than 150 times last year, a significant increase from previous years. "People have many reasons to follow each other," Peko said, "but they all want one thing in common—information, because information is the key to success."

	A woman who benefited from such an investigation happily told her friends: She had been in a close relationship with a businessman for eight months and was ready to get married, but she always had some doubts about her future husband. So, she hired Peko's detectives to investigate his background. To her surprise, she discovered that the businessman was already married. She immediately decided to end all contact with him.

	One of Peko's capable assistants, Jenny Konda, analyzed the reasons why more and more single men are turning to detectives. She said that due to the emergence of AIDS, more people are eager to get married. Therefore, they are keen to know everything about their partners: where they go, who they are with; what clothes they wear, who they meet; when they return home with whom, and so on. Konda gave an example: A man who wanted to get married and start a family was able to avoid three potential pitfalls with her help. The first was a female drug dealer, the second was a married woman with children, and the third was a woman with a complicated and immoral lifestyle.

	The chairman of the "World Association of Detectives," representing 47 countries, Lalee Weeb recently pointed out that the increasing number of single men tracking each other "is a global phenomenon," primarily due to the worsening AIDS epidemic. Therefore, "people are very cautious about those they associate with," and as soon as they have any doubts, they hire detectives to conduct investigations. "This is a global trend that is on the rise."

    信息的妙用
    眼下，美国的私家侦探正忙得不亦乐乎。许多单身汉登门求助，请他们调查准备与之婚配者的身世及行踪。
    据一家私人侦探公司的老板维森特·派柯宣称，他公司的侦探去年受聘从事这种调查不下一百五十次，比前几年大大增加。“人们有众多原因相互跟踪。”派柯说，“但他们都只要一样共同的东西——信息，因为，信息是成功的关键”。
    有位得益于这种调查的妇女不无欣慰地这样告诉朋友：她与一个商人经过八个月的密切过往，准备缔结良缘，但她对这位未来夫婿总有点不放心。于是，便雇佣派柯的侦探去调查背景，不查不知道，一查吓一跳。原来，那位商人竟已是有妇之夫。她当机立断，马上停止同他的一切关系。
    派柯的一位得力助手珍妮·孔达对越来越多的单身汉求助于侦探的原因作分析说，由于艾滋病的出现，有更多的人乐于成家。所以，他们急于了解对方的一切行踪：他（她）去哪里，同谁在一起；他
  （她）穿什么衣服，会见谁；他（她）何时又同谁
  一起回家，等等。孔达举例说，有位颇想成家立业的男子，由于她的帮助终于先后三次弄清对方背景而避免陷入困境。头一个是女毒贩子，其次是已有孩子的有夫之妇，第三个则是关系极为复杂、行为不轨的女人。
    代表四十七国私人侦探的“世界侦探联合会”主席拉莱·威勃最近也指出，愈益增多的单身汉相互追踪“是一种全球性现象”，其原因主要应归诸于艾滋病的日益严重。所以，“人们对同其来往的人非常谨慎”，只要稍有怀疑，便雇侦探进行调查，“这是一种世界性的趋向，正方兴未艾”。        士芳  编译
