The economic status of Black Americans will likely remain unequal to that of whites well into the next century. According to a report by the Washington Post, a research report released at the conclusion of the National Urban League's annual meeting on August 8 stated: aside from slight improvements in education and health, African Americans have made very slow progress in employment and other economic areas.

The league estimated, based on official statistics, that it will take Black Americans 54 more years to achieve equal employment in managerial and professional fields with whites. The report also mentioned that the poverty line for Blacks is significantly lower than the official poverty line for whites, estimating that it will take until the year 2154 for Blacks to achieve economic parity with whites.

    美国黑人经济地位堪忧
    本报讯　美国黑人的经济地位到下个世纪也很难和白人看齐。据《华盛顿邮报》报道，本月8日结束的全国城市同盟年会发表1份研究报告说：除在教育和卫生方面稍有改善外，非洲裔美国人在就业和其他经济范围内的进展极缓慢。
    这个同盟根据官方的统计数字估计，美国黑人要在54年以后才能在经理人员和专门行业就业方面取得和白人平等的地位。报告还说，黑人的贫困线大大低于官方规定的白人贫困线，估计要到2154年，黑人才可能在经济上和白人享有同等待遇。（封）
