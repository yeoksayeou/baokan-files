Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 7th.

The latest statistics from the State Statistical Bureau indicate that China's industrial production is currently showing two major trends: first, the production of energy, raw materials, and basic living necessities is steadily recovering; second, industrial inventories are significantly increasing, and industrial economic benefits are continuing to decline. This situation indicates that efforts to adjust industrial and product structures are urgently needed.

According to reports, the national industrial output value for July was 1.063 billion yuan, a 9.6% increase over the same month last year. Due to the impact of high temperatures, droughts, and floods, the average daily output in July decreased by 13.4% compared to the previous month. However, looking at the situation from January to July, industrial production has been relatively stable, with a cumulative industrial total output value of 7.463 billion yuan, a 10.2% increase over the same period last year. The production of energy, raw materials, and basic living necessities, which was sluggish at the beginning of the year, has now steadily recovered. From January to July, the total energy output increased by 5.9%, narrowing the gap with the industrial production growth rate. In July, the production of pig iron and steel materials increased by 4% and 4.2% respectively compared to the same month last year. The growth rates for industrial products such as ferroalloys, alumina, soda ash, ethylene, pesticides, and plastics ranged from 10.4% to 33%.

However, since this year, some household appliances, daily-use machinery, and investment-type electromechanical products have been significantly sluggish, leading to increased inventory. By the end of June, the inventory of finished products in state budgetary industrial enterprises increased by 1.8 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, a 36% increase. The State Statistical Bureau pointed out that if this situation continues, it will increase the effective use of funds and severely waste limited resources. Especially for state budgetary industrial enterprises, which are the foundation of national finances, the slowdown in fund turnover and the increase in production costs will lead to a continued decline in economic benefits. The realized profits of these enterprises in the first half of the year decreased by 12.1%. This issue must be given high attention, and industrial and product structures must be adjusted, and management must be improved to enhance benefits.

    工业生产呈现两个重要趋势
    能源原材料和基本生活品生产稳步回升
    工业库存大幅度上升经济效益继续下降
    新华社北京8月7日电　（记者吴士深）国家统计局最新统计显示，当前我国工业生产呈现两个重要趋势：一是能源、原材料和基本生活用品生产稳步回升，二是工业库存大幅度上升，工业经济效益继续下降。这种状况表明，调整产业结构、产品结构亟待下大功夫。
    据介绍，7月份全国工业产值完成1063亿元，比去年同月增长9.6％。由于受高温酷暑、洪涝灾害的影响，7月份平均日产值比上月下降13.4％。但从1至7月份情况看，工业生产形势比较平稳，累计工业总产值达7463亿元，比去年同期上升10.2％。年初不景气的能源、原材料和基本生活用品生产已经稳步回升，1至7月份能源总量增长5.9％，与工业生产增长速度差距缩小。7月份，生铁、钢材产量比去年同月分别增长4％和4.2％。铁合金、氧化铝、纯碱、乙烯、农药、塑料等工业品增长幅度为10.4％至33％。
    但是，今年以来，部分家用电器、日用机械、投资类机电产品明显滞销，积压增多。6月末，全国预算内工业企业产成品资金比年初增加180亿元，上升36％，国家统计局指出，这种状况如果继续下去，将加大资金的有效占用和有限资源的严重浪费。特别是作为国家财政基石的预算内工业企业资金流转减慢，生产成本上升，经济效益将继续下滑。上半年这类企业实现利润下降12.1％。对此，必须引起各方面高度重视，切实调整产业结构、产品结构，抓管理促效益。
