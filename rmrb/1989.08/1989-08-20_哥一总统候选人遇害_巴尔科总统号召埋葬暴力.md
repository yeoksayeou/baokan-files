Colombian Presidential Candidate Assassinated; President Barco Calls for Burial of Violence

Our reporter Zhu Manting reports from Caracas, August 20: The assassination of Luis Carlos Galan, a prominent Colombian politician and the leading presidential candidate of the Liberal Party, has caused a huge uproar across Colombia. President Barco delivered a speech stating that the Colombian government will take emergency measures to combat the recent wave of violence sweeping the nation and announced new anti-drug measures.

In recent times, drug trafficking organizations in Colombia have been extremely active, orchestrating multiple major assassination incidents. The other day, Galan, who had the highest support in the Liberal Party's primaries, was suddenly shot by a gunman during a rally in the southern suburbs of Bogota. Galan and two others were hit by bullets and immediately rushed to the hospital. Two hours later, Galan succumbed to his injuries despite efforts to save him. On the same day, in Medellin, a major hub for Colombian drug trafficking, drug traffickers intercepted Colonel Franklin Kindro, the police chief of Antioquia province (Medellin is the provincial capital), as he left his home and opened fire on him. Kindro was hit by numerous bullets and died on the spot. Subsequently, the notorious Medellin Cartel openly claimed that this was in retaliation for Kindro's anti-drug measures. Additionally, a high court judge and two city council members were also assassinated. The murders of Galan and others have shocked the entire country.

President Barco delivered a speech via national radio and television on the evening of the 18th, pointing out that this kind of assassination activity is not just aimed at the government or the judicial system, but is an attack on the entire nation. Therefore, the whole nation must respond to this. He announced the restoration of the extradition treaty with the United States and stated that all assets of drug traffickers will be seized. President Barco said that as long as all of Colombia remains truly steadfast and united, we can bury violence.

U.S. President Bush announced yesterday that the United States is prepared to cooperate in the swift extradition of Colombian drug traffickers.

    哥一总统候选人遇害
    巴尔科总统号召埋葬暴力
    本报加拉加斯8月20日电　记者朱满庭报道：哥伦比亚著名政治家、自由党最有希望的总统候选人路易斯·卡洛斯·加兰前天遇刺身亡，在哥伦比亚全国引起巨大震动。巴尔科总统发表讲话指出，哥伦比亚政府将采取紧急措施对付最近在全国范围内出现的暴力浪潮。并宣布了新的反贩毒措施。
    最近一个时期，哥伦比亚贩毒集团的活动气焰十分嚣张，先后制造多次重大暗杀事件。前天，自由党内预选中呼声最高的总统候选人加兰在波哥大南部郊区的群众集会上突然遭到一名枪手的扫射，加兰与其它两人同时中弹，立即被送进医院，两小时后，因抢救无效，加兰去世。同一天，在哥伦比亚贩毒集团的主要活动地区麦德林，贩毒分子阻拦了刚刚离开家门的安提奥吉亚省（麦德林是该省首府）警察局长弗兰克林·金德罗上校，并向这位上校猛烈开火，金德罗上校身中十数弹，当场身亡。事后，国际最著名的贩毒集团麦德林卡特尔公然声称，这是对金德罗上校采取反贩毒措施的“报复”。此外，一位大法官和两位市政议员也遭到暗杀。加兰等人惨遭暗杀震动了整个哥伦比亚。
    巴尔科总统18日晚通过全国广播电视系统发表讲话，指出（这种暗杀活动）不是针对政府、针对司法部门的，而是对整个国家的进攻，因此全国都要对此作出回答。他宣布，恢复与美国之间的引渡条约，所有贩毒分子的财产都将被没收。巴尔科总统说，只要全哥伦比亚保持真正的坚定和团结，那么我们就能埋葬暴力。
    美国总统布什昨天宣布美国准备进行配合尽快引渡哥伦比亚的贩毒分子。
