Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 21st.

North Korea reiterates that North and South should join the United Nations simultaneously.

The North Korean Foreign Ministry today emphasized that North and South Korea should join the United Nations simultaneously.

The statement said that the issue of joining the United Nations is an internal matter that should be resolved through dialogue and consultation between North and South Korea. North Korea also hopes to join the United Nations as soon as possible, but this is a matter of national survival that should be considered in conjunction with the issue of national reunification. Therefore, reunification should be achieved through a federal system, and then enter the United Nations with a unified name and a single seat. If South Korea joins the United Nations alone, it will have the serious consequence of legalizing the division of Korea internationally.

The statement calls on the international community to understand and support North Korea's position on the issue of joining the United Nations.

    朝鲜重申南北方应同时加入联合国
    新华社平壤8月21日电　朝鲜外交部今天强调说，朝鲜南北方应该同时加入联合国。
    声明说，加入联合国问题是应该由朝鲜北方和南方通过对话与协商去解决的民族内部问题。朝鲜北方也希望早日加入联合国，但这是关系到民族存亡的大事情，应该把它同国家的统一问题联系起来去考虑。所以，应该通过联邦制实现统一以后，以统一的国号和同一议席进入联合国。如果南朝鲜单独加入联合国，将会造成使朝鲜分裂在国际上合法化的严重后果。
    声明呼吁国际社会对朝鲜关于加入联合国问题的立场给予理解与支持。
