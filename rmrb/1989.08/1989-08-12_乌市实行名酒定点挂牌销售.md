The municipal Sugar and Liquor Company will supply the goods and implement a unified retail price. In case of further price reductions for famous liquors, the loss will be borne by the Sugar and Liquor Company. Retail units are not allowed to maintain the original price or raise prices arbitrarily. Additionally, all wholesale famous liquors will be stamped with the "Urumqi Specialized Sales" seal to prevent counterfeits.

    乌市实行名酒定点挂牌销售
    据新华社乌鲁木齐8月12日电　（记者杨生蒲）爱喝酒的乌鲁木齐市民从8月1日起，只要走进“国家名酒销售专店”便可以买到正牌名酒。
    为了防止坑害顾客的现象发生，市糖酒公司和市专卖事业局确定，将40家商店定为乌鲁木齐市的“国家名酒销售专店”，挂牌经销。由市糖酒公司供应货源，执行统一零售价。如遇名酒价格再次下调，其损失由糖酒公司负担，零售单位不得维持原价或乱涨价，同时，对批发的名酒均加盖“乌专监销”字样的印章，以防假冒。
