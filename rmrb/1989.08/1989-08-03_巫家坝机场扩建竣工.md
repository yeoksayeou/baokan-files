Wujiaba Airport Expansion Completed

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Kunming on August 2, the expansion project of Kunming Wujiaba Airport's flight area was completed and accepted today, and will be put into use in the near future.

	Kunming Wujiaba Airport was built in 1958 and could originally only accommodate medium and small aircraft. After the expansion of the flight area, the runway has been thickened on the original basis, extended to 3400 meters, and widened to 60 meters, allowing it to accommodate Boeing 747s, Airbus, and other large aircraft with a capacity of over 300 passengers. The airport's lighting and communication navigation systems, which are compatible with the runway, have also been completed.
