What is the current state of the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas? Can the Party's leadership be "diminished"? With these questions in mind, we visited some rural Party branches in counties such as Huangchuan, Shangcheng, and Guangshan in the Xinyang region of Henan Province.

"With Production Responsibility to the Household, We Still Need the Party Branch"

"With production responsibility to the household, we no longer need the Party branch," was a common misunderstanding in rural areas in the past. Some places even had the saying, "Party member or not, it's just a few cents (party dues)." After the implementation of the household responsibility system in rural areas, some Party members stopped paying even the few cents of party dues.

Facing reality, the Xinyang Regional Party Committee has invested a lot of effort in Party building work in recent years. They have carried out activities such as Party member evaluation, establishing Party member contact households, and Party members striving to be poverty alleviation and enrichment leaders. Since the end of last year, they have rectified 333 rural Party branches that were in a state of paralysis or semi-paralysis, further enhancing the Party's leadership role in rural areas. The facts have proven: "With production responsibility to the household, we still need the Party branch."

In 1979, the per capita income in Yan'gang Village, Huangchuan County, was only 60 yuan. By 1988, it had reached 560 yuan. The village had electricity, roads, schools, enterprises, a nursing home, and abolished the village levy, reducing the burden on farmers. None of these achievements would have been possible without the leadership of the Party branch.

Li Yongjiu, the Party branch secretary, is the "backbone" of the 3,100 villagers. Party members are the leaders. Of the 46 Party members, except for 6 who are elderly and ill, the rest either serve as village group leaders and leaders of village-owned brick kilns, flour mills, and forest farms, or as forest guards, water managers, accountants, and procurement staff, serving the community. Forest guard Huang Chuanping, to protect the village's 7,000 mu of Chinese fir forest, lived in a hut year-round, patrolling the mountains and forests, and died of exhaustion on a hillside at the age of 34.

Advanced Party Branches Need Good Branch Secretaries

Looking at the villages in the Xinyang region where poverty alleviation and enrichment have been effective, each has a strong Party branch. In villages where the Party branch is in a state of paralysis or semi-paralysis, although there are "capable people" and "millionaires," most villagers do not get rich, and work such as road construction, bridge building, water conservancy, agricultural tax collection, and family planning is also difficult to carry out.

An advanced Party branch first needs a branch secretary who is not afraid of losing out and is willing to sacrifice. Tang Liquan, the Party branch secretary of Lidian Village, Luoshan County, was once a famous poultry specialist, earning 13,000 yuan a year. He was also a student at the Agricultural Correspondence University. After being elected as the Party branch secretary of Lidian Village in 1986, he could no longer raise chickens, earn much money, or continue his correspondence studies, but he had no complaints. He led the villagers in scientific pig, cattle, and poultry farming, as well as in silk weaving, fruit tree grafting, and other activities. By 1988, the village had more than 200 households specializing in scientific pig farming. The village had an average of 3.7 pigs per household, and this alone increased per capita income by more than 300 yuan.

Li Youjin, the Party branch secretary of Chengang Village, Guangshan County, led the villagers in establishing a brick and tile factory. At a critical moment in the construction, it was time to harvest rice, and he insisted on working at the brick and tile factory to prevent the 200,000 yuan investment from being damaged, resulting in his own rice fields being flooded and the rice sprouting, causing a loss of more than 2,000 yuan. The village introduced a type of "olive-shaped" rapeseed from outside, and to be safe, he first planted it in his own 4 mu of responsibility land. In the spring, all the seedlings froze to death, causing a loss of more than 800 yuan. He believed that if there are losses, he should bear them first, and if there are benefits, the villagers should enjoy them first.

"The Masses Look at Party Members, Party Members Look at Cadres"

The village Party branch secretary is an active Party worker in the fields, who does not receive state salary and has no administrative rank. They jokingly refer to themselves as "external-level state cadres," truly "sesame officials." But they play a crucial role in the fate of a village with hundreds of households and thousands of people. Farmers often judge the image of the Party and accept the Party's leadership through these Party members and cadres. If the Party members and branch secretaries are not strong, the Party's role in rural areas cannot be fully played.

In several advanced Party branches, we saw that they have established strict systems. For example, the Party branch of Yan'gang Village, Huangchuan County, has three "no's" for branch committee members: one, do not eat in the village office without official business; two, do not borrow money from the village committee; three, do not use public funds to eat out while on a business trip. The Party branch of Xiamah River Village stipulates: village cadres are not allowed to attend village weddings and funerals, and if they violate this once, they will be fined 30 yuan each, and Party small group leaders and village group leaders who violate this will be fined 20 yuan each time.

Once a system is established, it must be implemented, especially the more difficult ones. In recent years, Xiamah River Village Party branch secretary Chen Wanlin has married two daughters-in-law, married off a daughter, and buried an elderly person, without holding a single banquet or receiving a single gift. Li Yongjiu of Yan'gang Village only bought two packs of cigarettes and two pounds of fruit candy when marrying a daughter-in-law. The family planning work in Oulou Village, Shangcheng County, has long been lagging behind, mainly because the branch secretary did not take the lead. With the support of the county Party committee organization department and the township Party committee, this branch held several life meetings, pointing out the branch secretary's problems, which had a great impact on him. He persuaded his daughter-in-law to undergo sterilization surgery, and soon, the family planning work in the entire village opened up a new situation.

    “还得靠支部”
    ——河南信阳地区农村党建工作散记
    钟家智　赵主明　李德民
    党在农村基层组织现状如何？党的领导能不能“淡化”？带着这些问题，我们走访了河南省信阳地区的潢川、商城、光山等县的一些农村党支部。
    “联产到了户，还得靠支部”
    “联产到了户，不再要支部”，这是前些年农村普遍存在的一种糊涂认识。有些地方原来就有“党员不党员，只差几分钱（党费）”的说法。农村实行联产承包责任制后，有些党员连几分钱的党费也不交了。
    中共信阳地委面对现实，近几年花大功夫抓了党建工作。他们先后开展了党员评格、建立党员联系户、党员争当扶贫致富带头人等活动。从去年年底以来，对全区333个处于瘫痪、半瘫痪状态的农村支部进行了整顿，进一步发挥了党在农村的领导作用。事实证明：“联产到了户，还得靠支部”。潢川县晏岗村1979年人均收入只有60元，1988年达到560元，通了电、修了路、建了学校、办了企业，盖了敬老院，取消了全村的提留款，减轻了农民的负担。办这些事，没有党支部的领导是根本不可能的。
    支书李永久是3100名村民的“主心骨”，党员是带头人，46名党员中除6名年迈多病，其余的或者担任村民组长和村办砖瓦厂、面粉厂、林场的领导，或者担任护林员、管水员、会计员、采购员，为大家办事。护林员黄传平为了保护村里的7000亩杉木林，常年住庵棚，巡山林，累死在山坡上，年仅34岁。
    先进党支部需要好支书
    看看信阳地区那些治穷致富效果显著的村，都有一个坚强的党支部；凡是党支部处于瘫痪和半瘫痪的村子，虽然也出“能人”，出“万元户”，但大多数村民富不起来，修路、修桥、修水利、收农业税、计划生育等工作也难以开展。
    一个先进党支部，首先要有不怕吃亏，勇于奉献的支部书记。罗山县李店村党支部书记汤礼全，原来是远近闻名的养鸡专业户，每年获利13000元，他还是农业函授大学的学生。1986年当选李店村党支书后，鸡养不成了，钱赚不多了，函授学习也中断了，可是他毫无怨言。他带领群众科学养猪、养牛、养禽，还搞抽纱刺绣、果树嫁接。1988年全村科学养猪专业户达200多户。全村户均饲养生猪3.7头，仅此一项，人均收入300多元。
    光山县陈岗村党支部书记李友金，领导村民办砖瓦厂，在施工关键时刻，赶上收割水稻，他为了使投资20万元的工程不受损失，坚持在砖瓦厂干，结果自家田里的水稻没有及时收割，泡在水里发了芽，损失2000多元。陈岗村从外地引进一种“橄榄型”油菜籽，为了保险起见，他先在自家4亩责任田种，开春后菜苗全部冻死，损失800多元。他认为，有亏要自己先吃，有便宜要让群众先占。
    “群众看党员，党员看干部”
    村支部书记是活跃田间地头的党的工作者，不吃“皇粮”，无行政级别，他们戏称自己是“国家干部等外级”，是真正的“芝麻官”。但对一个村几百户几千口人的命运，他们又起着关键作用。农民往往是从这些党员、干部身上去看党的形象，通过他们去接受党的领导。如果党员不过硬，支书不过硬，党的作用在农村是发挥不出来的。
    我们在几个先进党支部，都看到他们制定有严格的制度。比如，潢川县晏岗村支部给支委定有“三不准”：一、无公事不准在村部吃饭；二、不准在村委会借款；三、出差不准用公款下饭馆。下马河村党支部规定：村民办红白喜事，村支部和村委会干部不准吃请，如果违犯一次，每人罚款30元，党小组长和村民组长违犯的，一次罚款20元。
    定了制度就得执行，越难执行的越要执行。下马河村支书陈万林近几年娶两个儿媳妇，嫁一个闺女，安葬一位老人，没摆一桌酒席，没收一份礼。晏岗村李永久娶儿媳妇只买了两条烟、两斤水果糖。商城县欧楼村计划生育工作长期落后，主要原因是支书不带头，在县委组织部和乡党委的支持下，这个支部连续召开几次生活会，一针见血指出支书的问题，他受到很大的触动，动员儿媳妇作了结扎手术，随后，全村计划生育工作立即打开了新局面。
