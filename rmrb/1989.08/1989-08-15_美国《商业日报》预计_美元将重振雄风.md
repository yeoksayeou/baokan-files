The U.S. Business Daily on August 14 carried a report saying that the sharp rise in the dollar's exchange rate last week may signal the beginning of the dollar's recovery.

On the last trading day of last week, the dollar's exchange rate against the West German mark in New York rose from 1:1.9065 to 1:1.9390, and against the Japanese yen from 1:139.85 to 1:141.85.

Analysts believe that the main reasons for the sharp rise in the dollar's exchange rate last week were Japan's announcement that its foreign trade surplus for July had fallen from $4.89 billion in the same period last year to $3.82 billion, and the U.S. announcement that its retail sales of goods in July had risen and wholesale prices had fallen. Whether the dollar's exchange rate will continue to rise depends on whether the U.S. foreign trade deficit can be further improved.

    美国《商业日报》预计
    美元将重振雄风
    新华社纽约8月14日电  美国《商业日报》14日刊登的消息说，上周美元汇价大幅度上升可能标志着美元重振雄风的开始。
    上周最后一个交易日，纽约市场上美元对西德马克的比价从前一个交易日的1美元兑换1.9065西德马克上升到1美元兑换1.9390西德马克，对日元的比价从1∶139.85上升到1∶141.85。
    分析家们认为，上周五日本宣布其7月份的外贸盈余从去年同期的48.9亿美元下降到38.2亿，以及美国宣布其7月份的商品零售额上升和批发物价下降，是这次美元汇价大幅度上升的主要原因。美元汇价是否还会继续上升关键要看美国的外贸逆差是否可能进一步改善。
