The Minister of the Geological and Mineral Resources Department, Zhu Xun, recently inspected the mineral development situation in Qinghai. He stated that China's geological and mineral resources industry is gradually overcoming the challenges of financial shortages and workforce instability, and is beginning to emerge from its trough. The national geological market has taken shape, and diversified operations have seen new developments.

Zhu Xun introduced that the geological and mineral resources sector has long been plagued by issues such as insufficient funds, an increasing number of surplus personnel, and the outflow of talent. In recent years, the sector has implemented the policy of "primary business focus with diversified operations." It has actively utilized its own advantages to provide various paid services to society, such as water exploration, mineral exploration, and tunnel excavation. Additionally, it has organized a large number of non-technical personnel to engage in the tertiary industry and diversified operations, achieving a shift from relying solely on state allocations to a multi-channel funding model. Last year, the income from the geological market and diversified operations in the geological and mineral resources system reached 800 million yuan, accounting for approximately one-fifth of the total geological exploration fees for the year, thus alleviating the financial shortage to some extent.

Zhu Xun mentioned that out of the 80,000 surplus personnel in the geological and mineral resources system, 50,000 have now been transferred to the geological market or engaged in diversified operations. Provinces such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hubei, Liaoning, and Shandong have basically achieved the goal of having no surplus personnel, and the geological and mineral resources workforce is becoming more stable.

    摆脱资金紧缺队伍不稳困境
    地矿业正走出低谷
    新华社西宁8月13日电　（记者李建宏）地矿部部长朱训日前在青海考察矿产开发状况时说，我国地矿行业正逐步摆脱资金短缺、队伍不稳的困境，开始走出低谷。全国地质市场已形成规模，多种经营有新发展。
    朱训介绍，地矿部门长期被资金不足、富余人员增多和人才外流等问题所困扰。近几年来，地矿部门执行“以业为主，多种经营”的方针，积极利用自身优势，向社会提供找水、找矿、打坑道等多种有偿服务，并组织大批非技术人员发展第三产业，从事多种经营，实现了资金补给从单纯依靠国家拨款的单渠道向多渠道转变。去年，地矿系统地质市场和多种经营的收入达8亿元，约占当年全系统地勘费的1／5，从而在一定程度上缓解了资金短缺的矛盾。
    朱训说，地矿系统富余的8万人中，现已有5万人转入地质市场或从事多种经营。广东、浙江、湖北、辽宁、山东等省已基本做到了无编余人员，地矿队伍趋于稳定。
