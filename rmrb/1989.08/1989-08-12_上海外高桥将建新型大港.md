Shanghai will construct a new-type large port in the Waigaoqiao area of Pudong to alleviate the current capacity constraints of Shanghai Port, drive the development of the Pudong New Area, and promote the growth of an export-oriented economy.

Located six kilometers east of the mouth of the Wusong River, Waigaoqiao has excellent conditions for port construction. According to the plan, a new port area combining shore-based and excavated berths will be built here. The final scale will reach 40 to 50 ten-thousand-ton berths, equivalent to the total number of ten-thousand-ton berths in Shanghai Port at present.

Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji recently stated that without a new-type large port, Shanghai cannot become a true international city. The construction of Waigaoqiao Port is an urgent task for implementing Shanghai's overall urban planning.

    上海外高桥将建新型大港
    本报上海八月十二日电　上海将在浦东外高桥地区建设一个新型的大港，以缓解上海港当前通过能力不足的矛盾，带动浦东新区的开发，促进外向型经济的发展。
    位于吴淞口外以东六公里处的外高桥，具有良好的建港条件。这里将按规划建设一个顺岸式与挖入式港池相结合的新港区，最终规模可达四十至五十个万吨级泊位，相当于上海港现有万吨级泊位的总数。
    上海市市长朱熔基日前表示，没有一个新型的大港，上海就不可能成为一个真正的国际城市。建设外高桥港是实施上海城市总体规划的当务之急。
