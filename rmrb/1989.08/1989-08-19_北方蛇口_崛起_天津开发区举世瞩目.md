The Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, which started five years later than the Shenzhen Industrial Zone, has a short history of nearly five years. However, it has been recognized by tens of thousands of domestic and foreign visitors as the "Northern Shenzhen."

The Tianjin Development Zone is adjacent to the Tianjin New Port and backs onto the two major cities of Beijing and Tianjin. It has convenient water, land, and air transportation. A new city that combines the strengths of Eastern and Western architectural styles and has a "simulated" international investment environment has already stood proudly on the former salt flats, attracting domestic and foreign visionaries to showcase their talents. By the first half of this year, the development zone had signed 138 joint ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned projects with businesspeople from 15 countries and regions, including Hong Kong, the United States, Japan, Taiwan, France, West Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, the Philippines, Belgium, Panama, Australia, Singapore, Macau, and South Korea, with a total investment of over $220 million. Nearly 200 domestically funded enterprises from Tianjin, Beijing, and other provinces in North China have also been established here, initially forming an export-oriented industrial structure with four pillar industries: new building materials, fine chemicals, light textiles and daily necessities, and electronics and instruments. Although it is still in the stage of building and producing simultaneously, the total social output value in four and a half years has exceeded 1 billion yuan, with an industrial output value of nearly 800 million yuan, profits of over 150 million yuan, and foreign exchange earnings from exports of over $50 million.

The Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway, currently under construction, passes through the middle section of the development zone's start-up industrial and residential areas, making the development zone and Tianjin Port even more closely connected. The American MGM Commercial Company seized the opportunity to sign a project with the development zone—the largest foreign investment project in Tianjin to date—where the development zone's land bureau will lease 5.3 square kilometers of land adjacent to the expressway's port extension line in the eastern part of the start-up area to the American side for development. It is estimated that foreigners will invest nearly $3 billion in infrastructure and ongoing projects, with an annual output value of 10 billion yuan after completion. Additionally, a 211-meter, 52-story twin-tower building will rise here, symbolizing China's gateway to the world.

    “北方蛇口”崛起
    天津开发区举世瞩目
    本报讯　比蛇口工业区晚起步五年的天津经济技术开发区，虽然仅有近五年的创业史，却被数以万计的中外来访者认为是“北方蛇口”。
    天津开发区毗邻天津新港、背靠京津两大城市，水陆空运输便利，一座融中西方建筑风格之长、具有“仿真”的国际投资环境的对外开放新城，已经傲然屹立在昔日的盐碱滩上，吸引了海内外有识之士前来大显身手。到今年上半年，开发区已和香港、美国、日本、台湾、法国、西德、丹麦、瑞士、菲律宾、比利时、巴拿马、澳大利亚、新加坡、澳门、南朝鲜等15个国家和地区的客商签定中外合资、中外合作、外商独资项目138个，累计投资总额2.2亿多美元；津、京及华北等腹地省市前来建立的内资企业也近200家，初步形成了以新兴建材、精细化工、轻纺日用品、电子仪表四大行业为支柱的外向型产业结构。尽管这里还处在边建设边生产阶段，四年半累计社会总产值仍然突破10亿元，其中工业总产值近8亿元，利润1.5亿多元，出口创汇5000多万美元。
    正在修建中的京津唐高速公路，穿过开发区的起步工业区和生活区的中间地段，使开发区和天津港更紧密地连为一体。美国MGM商业公司不失时机地同开发区签定了一项天津市迄今最大的外资投资项目——由开发区土地局向美方出让位于起步区东侧、邻近高速公路进港延伸线的5.3平方公里土地供其划片开发。预计外商将投资近30亿美元用于基础设施与在建项目，建成后年产值可达百亿元，还有一座高211米、52层的门型双塔高楼将从这里崛起，象征中国走向世界的大门。　王玉梅
