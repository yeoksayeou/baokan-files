On October 1, 1974, it was the 25th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. According to Chinese tradition, the 5th and 10th anniversaries are celebrated with grand ceremonies. As usual, a grand reception was held in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People on the evening of September 30. However, this day broke the cheerful atmosphere of previous grand receptions. People's moods were unusually heavy, and there were no warm handshakes or enthusiastic greetings as in the past. In the silence, everyone eagerly awaited: Would our beloved Premier Zhou be able to come? His serious illness was an open secret. People frequently checked their watches and then looked towards the entrance of the banquet hall. The vast banquet hall was so quiet that even the slightest movement of footsteps could be heard clearly. Suddenly, someone said, "The Premier has arrived!" Immediately, the banquet hall erupted in joy. The Premier was thin, and his steps were a bit slow, but his spirit was as usual. When he stood on the stage, raised his glass, and toasted the guests and the people of the nation, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause. Many foreign guests were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. Five thousand domestic and foreign guests raised their glasses to wish the Premier good health! Accompanied by deep and gentle music, the Premier, as usual, toasted each guest in turn. Our waiters carried bottles of wine and followed behind the Premier to refill his glass at any time. Unlike the usual service for the Premier, this time the waiters' hearts were tightly gripped.

We will never forget that just before the "May Day" holiday that year, before the Premier underwent another surgery, during the reception of a foreign head of state, the Premier specifically requested that all the old waiters who had served him in the past come to serve at this banquet. Most of the old waiters knew that the Premier was seriously ill, but they did not know the extent of his illness and the possible consequences of the surgery. After the banquet, we escorted the Premier out of the north gate, from the second-floor banquet hall to the first-floor north hall, watching the Premier's kind figure and increasingly thin face, we couldn't help but feel a surge of pain in our hearts. Everyone understood the Premier's intentions, and the Premier also understood the feelings of these waiters who had worked by his side for many years. His kind gaze swept over each person, and he shook hands with everyone, asking about their well-being as usual. The waiters did not say "goodbye" as enthusiastically and innocently as they had done in the past when seeing the Premier off. Instead, they stood there, stunned, their hearts shaken by the Premier's thin figure, sincerely wishing the Premier a speedy recovery and a "return visit." But this shared wish was choked in their throats, and no one could say it out loud. Only one waiter softly said, "Please take care of yourself, Premier." Immediately, the tears that had been welling up in everyone's eyes flowed out.

People often say that tears are the most sincere expression of emotion. Our sincere feelings for Premier Zhou came from his spirit of "devoting oneself to the party and the people, working until death" that we had seen and heard over the years. It came from his careful care and guidance for the Great Hall of the People and us, the staff. It came from our admiration for his noble character.

The Great Hall of the People began construction on October 28, 1958, and was completed and put into use on September 10, 1959. At that time, Premier Zhou clearly pointed out that the entire task of the Great Hall of the People was to serve the political activities of the party and the state. To achieve this goal, he devoted his heart and soul to the daily management, business construction, personnel quality, and training of the Great Hall of the People from the very beginning. It was under Premier Zhou's direct care and specific guidance that a set of management systems and service work standards were basically formed in three to four years. A team of service personnel with excellent service quality, who could skillfully serve the central leaders, was established and trained.

The staff of the Great Hall of the People were mostly transferred from various parts of the country. Except for a few professional and technical personnel, from management cadres to front-line service personnel, no one was a "professional." After simple training, they went to work. The Premier paid the most attention to safety in the work of the Great Hall of the People. He repeatedly emphasized to the design and construction personnel during the review of the design drawings and the inspection of the construction process: "The safety of the Great Hall of the People is very important. Its lifespan should be longer than the Forbidden City and Zhongshan Hall, at least not less than 350 years." For this, he also mentioned the lesson of the collapse of the second-floor stage during the celebration of the "Seventh National Congress" in Yan'an, warning the design personnel to take it as a caution. He jokingly told the then deputy mayor of Beijing, Wan Li, and the chief designer, Zhao Pengfei, and Shen Bo: "You three must ensure the structural safety. If there is a problem, you will be the ones to take the blame." After the completion of the Great Hall of the People, the Premier said: "Built in one year, maintained in five years." Even in 1972, when the Premier knew he had an incurable disease, while reviewing the architectural model of the East Tower of the Beijing Hotel in Fujian Hall, he meaningfully told the relevant comrades: "In the future, the maintenance of the Great Hall of the People will depend on you." In the early 1960s, a fire occurred in the Tianjin Gymnasium. That night, after the Premier attended a meeting at the Great Hall of the People until after two o'clock in the morning, he still had the relevant comrades accompany him to inspect the safety of key areas of the Great Hall of the People from top to bottom, including the basement, for more than an hour before he could leave with peace of mind. Once, during the construction of the Jiangsu Hall, a window was accidentally set on fire. The Premier severely criticized, saying: "Those who lack a sense of responsibility cannot work here. This is the place where the party's central activities are held, and no accidents can occur." In daily service work, the Premier also put the safety of Chairman Mao and other central leaders in the Great Hall of the People in the first place.

Premier Zhou, with his extreme loyalty and high sense of responsibility to the party, the revolutionary cause, and the interests of the people, carefully cared for Chairman Mao's health. In our service work at the Great Hall of the People, we saw that whenever Premier Zhou accompanied Chairman Mao to participate in internal and external activities, he would first inspect the routes and halls where Chairman Mao would walk and activities. The chairs and sofas that Chairman Mao would sit on, he would shake, press, and first try sitting on them, and then tell the waiters: "After placing the chairs, you should sit on them to see if there are any problems; the seams of the carpets should be flat because elderly people have difficulty lifting their feet and may trip." The menus for the banquets that Chairman Mao attended, he would review again and again, all for the safety and health of Chairman Mao. Before the National Day reception in 1963, a foreign youth delegation requested a photo with Chairman Mao, originally scheduled in the reception hall, and had already stood on the photo frame. But when Chairman Mao arrived at the hall, the people immediately rushed down from the photo frame and surrounded Chairman Mao. To prevent Chairman Mao from being jostled, Premier Zhou immediately organized and, with the relevant personnel, formed a protective circle by holding hands, ensuring Chairman Mao's activity safety and successfully taking a photo with the foreign guests.

The "Cultural Revolution" began, and Premier Zhou immediately proposed that all work at the Great Hall of the People should start from "protecting Chairman Mao, protecting the party central, and protecting the Great Hall of the People." For this, he also clearly proposed: The "Cultural Revolution" of the Great Hall of the People should educate itself, not introduce external forms, and should focus on revolution and promote work. Unfortunately, under the interference of the person in charge of the Central Office at that time, the Premier's instructions were not carried out. Some rebels, armed with the "justified rebellion" talisman, began to arbitrarily rebel against anyone and anything. The 10,000-seat auditorium of the Great Hall of the People, a solemn political venue for the Chinese Communist Party and the National People's Congress to hold national congresses, was temporarily turned into a place to struggle against members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, vice premiers, and marshals of the People's Republic of China. The rebels of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a "criticism of Comrade Chen Yi meeting" in the Great Hall of the People and demanded that the Premier attend, but in reality, it was to let the Premier accompany the struggle. Because the central foreign affairs power had always been directly managed by the Premier. In those days, as the premier of the state, he was often powerless in many major issues, bearing humiliation and hardship. But Premier Zhou, who was good at struggle and dared to struggle, on the one hand, insisted on obeying the party's discipline, and on the other hand, used struggle tactics to fight tenaciously with the extremists manipulated by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique. He agreed to attend the "criticism of Comrade Chen Yi meeting," but first declared: "No shouting of 'down with,' no large banners, and no fighting." He sat next to Comrade Chen Yi, obviously sharing the humiliation suffered by this marshal. However, during the meeting, a large banner reading "down with Chen Yi" suddenly hung down from the second-floor balcony, and a few burly men tried to fight on the stage. The Premier was furious and immediately criticized the rebels: "You don't keep your word," ordering the immediate removal of the banner, and instructing the relevant personnel to protect Comrade Chen Yi and other comrades being struggled and accompanied out of the meeting venue, and then he left in anger.

In the early days of the "Cultural Revolution," the Premier, for the sake of the country's safety, protected a large number of old cadres of the party and the state. He often negotiated with the rebels at the Great Hall of the People, often from one hall to another, all night long. The Premier always patiently explained to the rebels of a province or a central department, but he severely criticized and stopped the rebels' unreasonable demands. At that time, the first secretary of the Northeast Bureau, Song Renqiong, and the second secretary, Ma Mingfang, were summoned to Beijing by the Premier to report on work. The rebels from the Northeast followed them to Beijing. The Premier, to protect the safety of Comrades Song Renqiong and Ma Mingfang, temporarily arranged for the Great Hall of the People to accommodate them in a hall, and asked the waiters to take good care of these two leaders who had been tortured to exhaustion. At the same time, in the East Hall on the first floor of the middle section of the Great Hall of the People, he negotiated with the rebels from the Northeast. The rebels did not listen to the Premier's advice and shouted loudly, demanding that if the Premier did not agree to their conditions, they would enter the Great Hall of the People to arrest Comrades Song Renqiong and Ma Mingfang. At this time, the Premier stood up and sternly warned: "If you want to enter the Great Hall of the People to arrest people, I will stand at the east gate of the Great Hall of the People and let you step over me." The Premier's will was firm, and he did not yield an inch on principles. We often saw the Premier sternly stop the rebels' arrogant demands with a cold stare, ensuring the safety of a group of old comrades.

In the later period of the "Cultural Revolution," the seriously ill Premier entrusted Comrade Deng to summon a group of party and state leaders who had not yet resumed work to study documents and discuss the situation in the West Conference Hall of the Great Hall of the People. At that time, we, the waiters on duty, often heard Comrade Deng convey the Premier's care for these old comrades. The Premier also personally told the waiters: "The temperature of the hall should be maintained well. You should open the windows to change the air every day you go to work, so that the air in the hall is fresh. Otherwise, elderly people are prone to catch a cold." In our daily service work, the Premier also cared deeply for the health of the central leaders. He once instructed us to number the high cups used by them for drinking water exclusively. He also said that these leaders were mostly elderly and some were in poor health, "You should strictly disinfect the tea sets, arrange the seats according to the situation of the elderly, and the sofas and chairs should be soft and hard, with some having cushions and footrests."

Since the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution," we, the waiters, clearly noticed that the Premier had become thin, and sometimes after an activity, we handed him a hot towel and a cup of water, gently telling him: "You should rest a bit." But our Premier would smile and say: "Do you think I can rest?" When some central leaders knew he was ill and reminded him to rest and take care of his health, we saw him always smile and say: "Now I only have eight words: 'Devote oneself to the party and the people, working until death.'"

On September 13, 1971, a Sunday evening. The Premier was in Fujian Hall with relevant personnel preparing the "Government Work Report" for the Fourth National People's Congress when a phone call suddenly came from Beidaihe, directly asking for the Premier. The waiter asked the Premier to take the call, and Beidaihe urgently reported to the Premier the situation of Lin Biao's escape. The Premier immediately took the car to Zhongnanhai to report to Chairman Mao. The Premier returned from Chairman Mao's place already late at night and immediately convened a Politburo meeting to make arrangements. The Great Hall of the People was in a state of readiness. The key figures of the Lin Biao counter-revolutionary clique were placed in several halls and controlled. The Premier, who lived in the North Small Hall of the West Grand Hall with only a few sofas, frequently went back and forth between the temporary residence of Chairman Mao in Hall 118 of the Great Hall of the People. The Premier, who was in a state of high tension, looked completely unfatigued, but his mood was unusually heavy. The meals sent upstairs were not seen to be eaten by the Premier; the water cup was not seen to be taken a few times; the Premier, who usually did not smoke, asked the waiter to prepare cigarettes for him at this time, sometimes smoking a few puffs, sometimes smelling them on his nose, and more often rubbing some menthol on his forehead to refresh his spirits. It was deep into the night, and the North Small Hall was too quiet. The waiter gently pushed open the door to observe whether the Premier was resting, and saw him sitting on the sofa, staring fixedly at the ceiling, thinking. In this way, our Premier, for 56 consecutive hours, did not close his eyes for three days and two nights. When he heard the news of Lin Biao's plane crash, he happily told the waiter: "Bring wine! Bring wine!" In the West Grand Hall, he raised a champagne glass with everyone to celebrate. For many days, this was the first time we saw the Premier so excited.

Premier Zhou was very familiar with all the etiquette and standards of reception service work. The layout of the halls, the training of the service personnel's thoughts and business skills, the construction of service operation standards and systems of the Great Hall of the People were all carried out under the Premier's care. He observed the reception service work of the Great Hall of the People in detail and gave very specific guidance. The reception halls of the Great Hall of the People were arranged with sofas and chairs according to their shape, generally forming a "horseshoe" shape according to the number of people using them. The Premier often stood by and directed us on how to arrange and place them when it was necessary to temporarily add positions or change shapes according to the number of people. He also instructed the person in charge of the hall layout during the construction of the Great Hall of the People: "The layout and furnishings of each hall should have different characteristics, but the sofas and furnishings should not be too heavy, so as not to make the service personnel too tired to move."

Before the "Cultural Revolution," the walls of the halls were decorated with traditional Chinese paintings. During the "Cultural Revolution," some people said that these were all "four olds" that should be swept away and should be replaced with quotations from Chairman Mao, creating a "red ocean." The Premier said sadly: "You are all children, you don't understand!" And he positively guided, saying that the most important expression of respect for Chairman Mao was to ensure his safety and do a good job in the service work.

The banquet for receiving foreign guests was usually Chinese cuisine. Chinese cuisine has many characteristics, and some foreign guests who came to China for the first time did not know the eating procedure. The Premier always asked the waiters to report the name of each dish and demonstrate the use of tableware when a dish was served, so that the guests could eat conveniently. Roast duck is a common dish in Chinese banquets, especially for foreign guests who come to Beijing for the first time. When it was found that the duck slices were a bit large, the Premier asked us to tell the chef: "Please ask the chef to cut the duck slices smaller and in a round shape, so that it is convenient for the guests to eat with pancakes." He also criticized some improper practices, saying: "Eating roast duck in the Great Hall of the People should have the characteristics of a state banquet and cannot bring the set of a roast duck restaurant here." To facilitate the guests, pay attention to hygiene and courtesy, he also proposed the practice of "eating Chinese food in the Western style."

The Great Hall of the People has a banquet hall with seats for 5,000 people. When reviewing the architectural drawings, the Premier pointed out that for 5,000 people to dine, the waiters should send the dishes and rice to the dining table at the same time, and a food transport car should be designed. This not only took care of the guests but also considered the work of the service personnel. This is the current practice of dividing several areas in the banquet hall for thousands of people to dine using food carts to deliver dishes. At that time, our state banquets not only had a grand scale and many diners but also had many dishes, taking up a lot of time and being wasteful. The Premier suggested that the relevant departments study the reform of state banquets, with fewer but better dishes, and not be impolite. The current state banquet of "four dishes and one soup" was personally determined by the Premier in 1963 and has continued to this day, embodying the hospitality of the Chinese nation and the frugality of the country.

Premier Zhou was meticulous and demanding in his guidance and requirements for the service and management work of the Great Hall of the People. Even the smallest matters were not overlooked. From the service procedures of Chinese and Western banquets to targeted services based on different service objects and cultural characteristics; from the cleanliness of the halls, the placement of spittoons to the deodorization of toilets, the washing and changing of towels, he pointed out problems in time and instructed how to do it to meet the standards and etiquette, making the guests satisfied. The tap water in Beijing has a high alkalinity. To ensure the clarity and fragrance of Longjing tea, the Premier asked us to add filter cloth to the hot water tap of the boiler. Sometimes the time for receiving foreign guests was short, so the Premier asked us to first pour a little water into the cup to soak the tea leaves, and then pour it full and serve it when the guests arrived, so that the guests could drink it at an appropriate time.

The Premier also required us to treat internal activities equally in our service work, and to serve tea and towels in order of seats. Sometimes we did not pay attention and started from the Premier, and he would criticize us on the spot: "You are 'chiefism,' I am also a servant of the people, why should I be treated specially?" For foreign affairs service, the Premier required us to strictly follow the etiquette and standards. Handing over towels, serving tea, and serving dishes must be done in the order of foreign guests first, then domestic guests, and foreign female guests first, then important foreign guests. The word "please" must come first, and the action must follow. He also educated us to write it down as a service standard to train new waiters. The Premier often instructed us: "You should learn some foreign languages and master some common foreign language conversations. Isn't it said that you need to provide first-class service? Can you do it without polite foreign language? And he jokingly criticized, saying: "If you cannot use common foreign languages to speak in front of foreign guests, I will send you to a school for the deaf and dumb."

The Premier shouldered heavy responsibilities, was strict with himself, dressed neatly, and had a tidy appearance. In foreign affairs work, his etiquette was meticulous. At the same time, he also strictly required us, the waiters, and reminded us: "Serving foreign affairs in the Great Hall of the People is politics. Clothing, appearance, and posture represent the civilized character of the Chinese nation. Respect for guests should be reflected in your service, showing warmth and friendliness."

I remember when the Great Hall of the People was just completed, we were all young people who had just started working, mostly around 17 or 18 years old, and we did not know what service standards were, let alone the etiquette standards for foreign affairs service work. It was under the Premier's careful guidance that, with the accumulation of long-term practical experience in service work, we gradually formed today's relatively systematic reception service work standards and etiquette and courtesy rules with the characteristics of the Great Hall of the People.

Premier Zhou was strict with himself and never let others do his personal things. Once, when he came to the Great Hall of the People to receive foreign guests, the waiter found that his shoelace was untied, and bent down to tie it for him. The Premier quickly bent down and helped the waiter up, saying kindly: "How can you do this for me? I'll do it myself." Once, after a meal, the Premier took off his dentures and put them in a small cup. The waiter was about to wash them, but the Premier quickly took them back, saying: "This is so dirty, how can I let you wash it? I'll do it myself." The Premier did not bother others with these things if he could do them himself.

The Premier's frugality and integrity in his personal life were also exemplary. Because he spent a lot of time in the Great Hall of the People, he often did not have time to eat. Sometimes he would ask for a bowl of corn porridge or noodles. Even when he had a normal meal, it was very simple, usually with only two dishes and one soup. Sometimes he would ask the waiter to eat with him, but the portion would be larger. His meal expenses and sometimes the expenses for asking the waiter to eat with him were all paid by himself. He would check the accounts and receipts in person. Even the expenses for haircuts and shaves were not forgotten. Sometimes if he forgot a bill or found that he had paid less money or coupons, he would ask to make up the payment.

The Premier cared more for the young waiters than ordinary people would think. He told the leaders of the Great Hall of the People: "You have many young people, you should think more for them, you should open a few cultural courses, such as language, mathematics, geography, history, to improve their cultural quality, to meet their future development needs." According to the Premier's instructions, the Party Committee of the Great Hall of the People made specific arrangements and set up a school with various subjects. From literacy classes to high school classes. It is a pity that this school was dispersed at the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution," and the Premier's instructions were not implemented, delaying the development of a generation of young people in the Great Hall of the People.

In the eyes of a generation of old waiters of the Great Hall of the People, the Premier was both a beloved national leader and a kind elder. Serving the Premier, we always felt a great sense of honor and pride, and an inexhaustible energy. He also had a great attraction, making us want to approach him. Whenever the Premier finished his work, even if there was only one or two minutes of free time, we would all want to go up and shake hands and say hello. The Premier also made full use of these opportunities to approach the masses, chat casually, and encourage us to do a good job.

In July 1975, the Premier felt that his days were numbered and came to the Great Hall of the People for the last time to see the halls he had worked in and the old comrades he was familiar with. The waiters welcomed him at the door, and the Premier said as soon as he saw us: "It's been a long time, I really miss you all! I came here specially to see you, to talk to you, and to listen to you sing." We shook hands with the Premier, tears and smiles on our faces, excitement and sadness intertwined, but at that moment, no one would have thought that this would be the last time we saw the Premier and the last time we had a warm conversation. The Premier's body was even thinner, and his steps were even more laborious. With a reluctant heart, the Premier spent two and a half days, from the north section, the middle section's grand auditorium and grand stage, to the south section, looking at many halls where he had held meetings, worked, and received foreign guests. As in the past, the Premier walked and talked, asking about the work, study, family, and children of each comrade who accompanied him, and said earnestly: "In the future, you will be the elders of the Great Hall of the People. You should do a good job of passing on your skills to the new comrades, teaching them the good thoughts, good style, and good traditions of the Great Hall of the People."

The Premier was leaving, and we sent him off to the car. As usual, we did not see any sign of fatigue on the Premier's face, only that his steps were more laborious. When we shook hands with the Premier to say goodbye, one comrade looked at the spots on his hand, and he smiled and said: "This is due to poor blood circulation." He used this to cover up the concern of everyone for his serious condition. To prevent the Premier from seeing our sad expressions for his condition, we all suppressed our hearts that were torn apart and said goodbye to him with smiling faces. After the car door was closed and slowly started, we could no longer suppress our heartbreaking feelings. This last time, the waiters of the Great Hall of the People welcomed the Premier with tears and sent him off with tears.

This year is the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the 30th anniversary of the completion and use of the Great Hall of the People. In the past 30 years, the ideological construction, business construction, and reception service work of the Great Hall of the People have been carried out under the direct care and specific guidance of Premier Zhou for half of the time. Now we can report to the Premier that the safety service work management system, business operation procedures, and professional ethics standards established under his guidance have been systematically and completely formed into written standards, guiding our work and being carried forward in the journey of reform and opening up.

    周总理与人民大会堂
    刘连杭
    1974年10月1日是中华人民共和国成立25周年。按中国的习惯，遇五逢十的国庆是庆祝大典。照例这一年的9月30日晚，在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大的招待会。但这一天却一破历次大庆招待会的欢快气氛，人们的心情显得异常沉重，互相之间没有以往那种亲切地握手、热烈地问候。沉默之中人们翘首以待：我们敬爱的周总理还能来吗？他重病在身已是一个公开的秘密。人们不时地频频低首看表，然后目光又一齐投向宴会厅的入口处。偌大的宴会厅寂静得稍有脚步挪动的声音就清晰听到。这时不知谁首先说了一句：“总理来了！”顿时宴会厅一片欢腾。总理啊，人消瘦了，步履也显得有些迟缓，但精神一如往常。当他站在主席台上，擎起酒杯向在座的中外宾客和全国人民祝辞时，全场爆发起一阵阵雷鸣般的掌声，许多中外宾客激动得热泪盈眶。5000名中外宾客一齐举杯向总理表示善良而友好的祝愿！伴着浑厚而委婉的乐曲，总理与往年一样依次向大家祝酒，我们的服务员捧着酒瓶跟在总理后侧，以随时为总理斟酒；但与往常为总理服务时总是那样面带笑容不同的是，此刻服务员的心却是紧揪着。
    我们不会忘记，就在这一年“五·一”节的前夕，也就是周总理再次动手术之前，在接待一位外国元首时，总理点名让凡是过去为他服务过的老服务员都要来为这次宴会服务。多数老服务员已得知总理病重，但并不知道总理病重的程度和再次手术及可能带来的后果。宴会结束后，我们送总理出北门，从二楼宴会厅到一楼北大厅，看着总理那慈祥的背影和日渐消瘦的面容，不觉心里涌上一阵酸痛。大家明白总理的意思，总理也理解这些多年在他身边工作的服务员的心情，亲切的目光扫过每一个人，并和大家一一握手，像往常一样问长问短。服务员则没有同历次送总理出门那样孩子般热情天真的
  “再见”声，只是呆呆地站在那里，为总理消瘦的身体，内心震撼着，由衷地祝愿总理早日康复后“再来”。但这共同的心愿话却因咽喉的梗塞谁也没说出来，只有一个服务员轻轻地说了一句：“请总理多保重”。顿时早已噙在大家眼角的泪水夺眶而出。
    人们常说，眼泪是最真挚感情的表露。我们对周总理的真挚感情，来源于他对党、对人民“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”的精神耳濡目染，来源于他对人民大会堂和我们工作人员的悉心关怀与教导，来源于对他那崇高品格的敬仰。
                                （一）
    人民大会堂是1958年10月28日破土动工、1959年9月10日建成、正式交付使用的。当时，周总理即明确指出，人民大会堂的全部工作任务是为党和国家政治活动服务。为了实现这一目标，他一开始就为人民大会堂的日常管理、业务建设、人员素质和培训工作贯注心血。正是在周总理的直接关怀和具体指导下，用了三四年的时间一套管理制度和服务工作规范才基本形成了；一批具有优良的服务素质、能熟练地为中央负责同志工作服务的服务人员队伍才建立并培养起来了。
    人民大会堂的工作人员大都是从全国各地抽调来的。除少数专业技术人员外，从管理干部到前台服务人员，没有一个是
  “行家”出身，只经过简单培训就上岗了。总理对人民大会堂的工作，抓得最紧的首先是安全。他还在审查设计图纸和视察施工过程中，就对设计、施工人员反复强调：“人民大会堂的安全十分重要，它的寿命要比故宫和中山堂长，起码不应少于三百五十年”，“一定要抓好大会堂的结构安全”。为此，他还讲了在延安“七大”的庆祝晚会上，礼堂二层挑台坍塌的教训，要设计人员引以为戒，并风趣地对当时负责施工的万里副市长、赵鹏飞同志和总设计负责人沈勃说：“你们三个人一定要抓好结构安全，如果发生问题，那就要‘三个人头一把火’。”在大会堂建
  成后，总理说：“一年建成，五年维修”。直到1972年，总理已得知自己身患不治之症，在福建厅审查北京饭店东楼建筑设计模型时，还意味深长地对有关同志说：“将来大会堂的维修就靠你们啦。”60年代初，天津市体育馆一次发生火灾，当天晚上总理在大会堂参加完一个会议后，已经凌晨两点多了，还让有关同
  志陪同，从内到外，一直到地下室，用了一个多小时认真检查
  了大会堂重点部位的安全情况，才放心离去。一次江苏厅施工
  修窗子不慎失火，总理严厉批评说：“责任心不强的人不能在这
  里工作，这是党中央活动的地方，不能发生任何事故。”在日常服务工作中，总理更是把毛主席和其他中央领导同志在大会堂
  活动的安全放在第一位。
      周总理以他对党、对革命事业、对人民利益的极端忠诚和
  高度责任心，无微不至地关怀着毛主席的健康。我们在大会堂
  服务工作中看到，凡是有周总理陪同毛主席参加的内外事活动，
  毛主席走过的路线和活动的厅室，他都要首先查看；毛主席要
  坐的椅子、沙发，他都要用手摇摇、按按和首先试坐，并且告
  诉服务员说：“椅子摆上去，你们要坐一下，看看有什么问题；地毯结缝要平展，因为年龄大走路脚抬不高容易绊着”。毛主席参加的宴会菜单，他总是一审再审，一切为了毛主席的安全和健康。在1963年国庆招待会前，一个国外青年代表团要求与毛主席合影，本来安排在迎宾厅，已在照相架上站好。但当毛主席来到大厅后，人们一下子从照相架上涌下来，将毛主席围拢起来。为了防止挤碰着毛主席，周总理立即组织并和有关人员手拉着手形成一个保护圈，保证了毛主席的活动安全和顺利地与外宾合影。

    “文化大革命”一开始，周总理就对人民大会堂的工作提出一切要从“保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫人民大会堂”的安全出发。为此，他还明确提出：大会堂的“文化大革命”要自己教育自己，不要把外面的形式引进来，要抓革命促工作。遗憾的是在当时中央办公厅负责人的干扰下，总理的指示没能得到执行。某些造反者凭仗着“造反有理”的尚方宝剑，便随心所欲地造任何人、任何事的反。人民大会堂的万人大礼堂是中国共产党、全国人大召开全国代表大会的严肃的政治场所，一时竟变成了批斗中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理、中华人民共和国元帅的地方。外交部造反者在大会堂大礼堂召开“批判陈毅同志大会”，要求总理参加，而实际上是让总理陪斗。因为中央的外交大权一直是总理直接掌管的。那年代，作为国家总理，在许多重大问题上力不从心，忍辱负重。但善于斗争，敢于斗争的周总理，一方面坚持遵守党的纪律，一方面讲究斗争策略，同林彪、江青反革命集团操纵的少数极端分子进行着坚韧的斗争。他同意参加“批判陈毅同志大会”，但首先声明：
  “不许喊打倒”、“不许挂大标语”、“不许武斗”，并且坐在陈毅同志身边，显然是替这位元帅分担着蒙受的屈辱。可是，正在开会中间，突然从二楼挑台上悬下一幅“打倒陈毅”的大标语，几个彪形大汉还要上台动武。总理怒不可遏，当即严肃批评造反者：“说话不算数”，责令立即撤去这条大标语，并指示有关人员，保护好陈毅及其他被批斗和陪斗的同志离开会场，尔后他自己愤然离去。
      “文革”初期，总理为了国家安危，保护一大批党和国家的老干部，在大会堂经常同造反者谈判，往往是从这个厅到那个厅通宵达旦。总理对一个省或中央一个部门的几派之间做工作总是耐心地讲道理，但对造反者的无理要求则是严厉批评制止。当时东北大区党的第一书记宋任穷和第二书记马明方同志是总理调他们来京汇报工作的。东北的造反者追踪到京。总理为了保护宋任穷和马明方同志的安全，临时要大会堂将他们安排在一个厅室里，并要服务员好好照顾这两位已经被折磨得精疲力竭的领导同志休息一下。同时在大会堂中段一楼东厅同来自东北的那伙造反者谈判。造反者不听总理劝告，并大喊大叫地提出总理如不同意他们的条件，就要进大会堂抓宋任穷、马明芳同志。这时总理拍案而起，严厉警告：“你们要进大会堂抓人，我就站在大会堂东门，让你们从我身上踩过去。”周总理意
  志坚定，原则上寸步不让，我们多次看到总理怒目冷对地严厉
  制止那些造反者的狂妄要求，保证了一批老同志的安全。
    “文革”中后期，病重中的总理还委托邓大姐将当时还没恢复工作的一大批党和国家领导同志召集起来，在人民大会堂西会议厅学习文件，座谈形势。当时我们在场工作的服务员，经常听到邓大姐传达总理对这批老同志的关怀。总理还亲自告诉服务员：“厅室温度要保持好，你们每天上班要先打开窗子换换空气，要使厅内空气新鲜。不然上了年岁的人容易患感冒。”在我们日常服务工作中，总理为中央负责同志的身体健康，也是关怀备至的。他曾经指示我们，要把他们使用的饮水高杯编号专用。还说这些领导同志大多年事已高，有的身体较弱，“你们要将茶具严格消毒，要根据老年人的情况布置座位，沙发和椅子要软硬适宜，有的还要放上靠垫和脚垫。”
    从“文革”开始，我们的服务员即明显地发现总理消瘦了，有时一个活动结束，我们递上一块热毛巾，送上一杯水轻轻地告诉总理：“您该休息一下了。”我们的总理却微笑着说：“你看我能休息吗。”当有的中央领导同志得知他患病后，提醒他要注意休息，保重身体时，我们见他总是淡然一笑地说：“现在我只有八个字，‘鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已’。”
    1971年9月13日，星期天。晚上，周总理正在福建厅与有关人员研究准备召开四届人大的《政府工作报告》，突然北戴河打来电话，直接找总理。服务员请总理接过电话，北戴河急切地向总理报告了林彪外逃的情况。总理立即乘车去中南海向毛主席汇报。总理从毛主席处回来已是深夜，立即召开政治局会议进行布置，大会堂处于战备状态。对林彪反革命集团的干将分别安置在几个厅室里，采取控制措施。住在大会堂西大厅只有几个沙发的北小厅的总理，不断往来于临时住进大会堂一一八厅的毛主席之间。处于高度紧张之中的总理，看上去全无倦色，但心情异常沉重。服务员送上去的饭菜没见总理吃几口；水杯没见端几次；平时不抽烟的总理，这时却要服务员给他备烟，有时抽几口，有时在鼻子上闻闻，更多是在自己额头上抹一点清凉油提精神。夜深了，北小厅里太寂静了，服务员轻轻推开门缝观察总理是否休息，几次都见他只是坐在沙发上目不转睛地看着天花板在思考问题。就这样，我们的总理，连续三天两夜56个小时没有合眼；而当得知林彪机毁人亡的消息后，他高兴地对服务员说：“拿酒来！拿酒来！”在西大厅高举香槟酒杯与大家表示祝贺。多少时日了，我们这还是第一次看到总理那样的异常兴奋。
                                （三）
    周总理熟谙招待服务工作的一切礼仪、规范。人民大会堂从建成使用后的厅室布置，服务人员思想和业务素质的培训，服务操作规范、制度的建设，都是在总理关怀下进行的。他对人民大会堂的招待服务工作观察入微，指导也非常具体。人民大会堂的会见厅室是根据其形状用沙发和椅子布置起来的，一般按照使用人数围成“马蹄”形。总理有时经常在一个厅室连续会见几起外宾，每当根据人数需要临时增添位置或改变形状，总理总是站在一旁指挥我们如何布置摆放，既符合礼仪要求，又省时省力。还在人民大会堂建设过程中，他就指示负责厅室布置的同志说：“各厅室的布置、陈设，既要有不同特点，沙发、陈设又不能太重，以免服务员搬动太累。”
    “文革”前厅室墙壁都是以中国传统国画装饰，“文革”造反了，有人说这些都是应扫除的“四旧”，要一律换上语录牌，搞“红海洋”。总理委婉又痛心地说：“你们都是娃娃，不懂事啊！”并且正面引导说，对毛主席的尊重，最重要的表现是保证他老人家的安全，把服务工作做好。
    招待外宾的宴会一般是中餐。中餐有其许多特点，有些初次来华的外宾不懂食用程序，总理总是要服务员每上一道菜报菜名，做一个使用餐具的示范动作，以方便客人。烤鸭是中餐宴会常用的，尤其是初次到北京来的外国客人更要关照。当发现烤鸭片有些大时，总理就让我们转告：“请大师傅鸭片分割得要小些，要成圆形状的，用烧饼夹才方便客人。”还针对一些做法不当批评说：“在大会堂吃烤鸭要有国宴特色，不能把烤鸭店的一套搬来嘛”。为方便客人，讲究卫生、礼貌，还提出了分食单吃，也就是我们现在常说的“中餐西吃”。
    人民大会堂设有5000人座位的宴会厅，总理在审查建筑图纸时就指出，5000人用餐，服务员要把菜饭同时送到餐桌上，要设计运菜车。既照顾了客人，又顾及了服务人员的工作。这就是现在宴会厅几千人宴会，分为若干区用餐车分送菜肴的工作法。当时我国国宴不但场面大，就餐人数多，而且菜的道数也多，占去的时间长，浪费大。总理建议有关方面研究一下国宴的改革，菜要少而精，还要不失礼仪。我们现在的国宴“四菜一汤”，就是总理1963年亲自确定的并一直延续至今，既体现了中华民族的热情好客，又符合我国节俭的国情。
    周总理对大会堂的服务与管理工作，既细心指导又严格要求，那怕是很微小的事也不放过。从中西餐宴会的服务程序，到根据不同的服务对象和文化特点有针对性的服务；从厅室卫生清扫、痰盂摆放到厕所除臭、毛巾洗换，他发现问题都及时给以指出，并交代如何做才合乎标准、礼仪规范，使客人满意。北京的自来水含碱量大，为保证龙井茶清澈、沁香的特点，总理让我们在锅炉的开水笼头上加过滤纱布。有时会见外宾时间较短，总理就让我们事先将杯中的茶叶滴点开水泡开，待客人到时再斟满端上，以便客人饮用时适宜可口。
    总理还要求我们在服务工作中，除外事活动的礼仪需要外，凡内部活动要一视同仁，上茶、让毛巾一律按座位顺序来。有时我们不注意，先从总理那开始，他会当场批评我们：“你们就是‘首长主义’，我也是人民的服务员嘛，为什么要我特殊？”
    外事活动服务，总理则要求我们必须严格遵守礼仪规范。递毛巾、上茶、让菜必须先外宾后内宾，外宾中有女宾的先主要女宾后主要外宾，而且必须“请”字在前，动作在后，并且教育我们要用文字规定下来作为服务规范，用来培养新的服务员。总理还经常指示我们：“你们要学一点外语，掌握一些常用外语会话，不要哑巴服务。不是要求你们一流服务吗，没有外语的礼貌语言能行吗？”并风趣地批评说：“如果你们在外宾面前服务不能用常用外语讲话，我就把你们送到聋哑学校去。”
    总理肩挑重任，严以律己，衣着笔挺，仪表整洁，在涉外工作中的礼仪一丝不苟。同时也这样严格要求我们的服务员，并告诫我们说：“在人民大会堂为外事服务就是政治。衣着、仪容、姿态代表着中华民族的文明气质，对客人的尊敬，要通过你们的服务体现热情友好。”
    记得人民大会堂刚刚建成时，我们初来乍到，大都是刚刚从事工作的十七八岁的青年，根本不懂什么叫服务规范，更不懂外事服务工作的礼仪标准，正是在周总理的处处悉心教导下，随着服务工作长年实践经验的积累，才逐步形成了今天这样较为系统的有人民大会堂特色的招待服务工作规范、礼节礼貌守则。
    周总理严于律己，个人的事情从不让别人替他做。一次来大会堂接见外宾，进门后服务员发现他的鞋带开了，欠下身去准备为他系上，总理急忙弯下腰把服务员扶起来，并亲切地说：“这怎么能让你为我系呢，我自己来。”一次饭后，总理摘下假牙放在小杯里，服务员准备替他洗洗，但总理却连忙拿过去说：“这么脏，怎么能让你洗呀，我自己来。”总理在这些事情上凡是能自己做的从不麻烦他人。
    总理在个人生活上的节俭与廉洁也堪称师表。他因在大会堂活动时间长，经常吃不上饭，有时就让弄一点玉米粥或一碗面条吃。即是平时正常吃饭也很简单，一般只有两个菜、一个汤。有时还让服务员和他一起吃，只是量大一点。他的饭费和有时请服务员和他一起吃的费用都由自己掏，钱和粮票如数交够，并且亲自过目帐单。连每次的理发、剃须费都不忘掉。有时哪一笔忘掉了或他发现钱、粮票交的少了，他都会提出补交。
    总理对年轻服务员的关怀要比一般人想得更远，他对大会堂领导人说：“你们青年人多，要替他们想的远些，要开几门文化课，如语文、数学、地理、历史，提高他们的文化素质，以适应将来他们发展的需要”。根据总理的指示，大会堂党委作了具体安排，办起了多种学科的业校。从扫盲、小学班直至高中班。只可惜这个业校“文革”开始就冲散了，总理的指示未能实现，耽误了人民大会堂的一代青年人。
    在人民大会堂一代老服务员眼里，总理既是敬爱的国家领导人，又是慈祥的长者。为总理服务，总感觉得有一种巨大的光荣感、自豪感，有一股用不完的劲。他又给人一种巨大的吸引力，使你愿意同他接近。总理工作一结束，哪怕只有一、二分钟空间，我们都想凑过去握握手、问个好。总理也充分利用这些机会接近群众，随便谈几句，鼓励我们做好工作。
    1975年7月，总理自感来日不多了，最后一次来人民大会堂要看看自己过去工作过的厅室和熟悉的老同志。服务员在门口迎接，总理一见我们就说：“多日不见了，真想你们啊！”我是特地来看你们的，跟你们谈心，听你们唱歌”。我们笑脸上挂着泪水和总理握手，激动与难过交织，但此时谁也不会想到这将是最后一次见总理和最后一次亲切的谈话。总理的身体更消瘦了，迈开的脚步也更吃力了。总理怀着依依不舍的心情，用了两个半天的时间，从人民大会堂的北段、中段的大礼堂和大礼堂舞台，到南段看了他曾经开会、办公、接待过外宾的许多厅室。像过去一样，总理边走边谈，询问陪他的每个同志的工作、学习、家庭和孩子的情况，并语重心长地说：“将来你们就是大会堂的元老了，对后来的新同志要搞好传帮带，把大会堂的好思想、好作风、好传统教给他们。”
    总理要走了，我们送他上车，像往常一样没见总理脸上有丝毫倦容，只是见他迈动的脚步更吃力了。和总理握手告别时，有一个同志看了看他手上的斑点，他笑慰着说：“这是血液循环不好造成的。”以此来掩盖人们对他病重的忧虑。为了不让总理看到我们为他病情难过的心情，我们都强压着像被撕碎的心痛、打着笑脸送他上车，待车门关好，徐徐启动后，我们悲恸的心情就再也无法强忍了。这最后一次，我们人民大会堂的服务员，对总理是流着泪水迎来，又流着泪水送走的。
    今年是庆祝建国四十周年，也是纪念人民大会堂建成使用三十周年。三十年来，人民大会堂的各项思想建设、业务建设和招待服务工作，有一半时间是在周总理直接关怀和具体指导下开展起来的。现在可以告慰总理的是，由他指导建立的各项安全服务工作的管理制度、业务操作规程和职业道德规范，已经系统完整地形成了文字规范，正指导着我们的工作，并在改革开放的征途上发扬光大。
