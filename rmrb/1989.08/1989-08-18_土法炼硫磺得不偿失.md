The county of Fenxi currently has over 360 traditional sulfur furnaces, producing 1,500 tons of sulfur annually. Recently, I investigated six sulfur plants in this county and found that traditional sulfur production has more drawbacks than benefits and should not be developed indiscriminately.

Traditional sulfur production releases large amounts of sulfur smoke, polluting the environment and affecting health. Around Chengjiazhuang Sulfur Plant, many areas of land have a white frost-like covering. The hillside opposite the plant, which was once covered in shrubs, is now barren and desolate. The 200-plus mu of farmland in Chengjiazhuang Village sees a reduction of five to six ten-thousand kilograms of grain production each year.

The waste from sulfur production is dumped into rivers and streams, polluting water sources and blocking waterways. For every ton of sulfur produced, seven tons of waste are discharged. With an annual production of 1,500 tons of sulfur, over 10,000 tons of waste are discharged. Three wells by the river in Chengjiazhuang Village have been rendered unusable due to sulfur waste pollution. Villagers now have to fetch water from two kilometers away.

Traditional sulfur production wastes resources. The recovery rate for refining sulfur is only 30%. For every ton of sulfur produced, two tons are wasted. This results in a yearly waste of 3,000 tons of sulfur. Additionally, a large amount of sulfur powder ore extracted is discarded. Based on the local sulfur selling price, Fenxi County discards sulfur worth 5.52 million yuan annually.

### 土法炼硫磺得不偿失

    土法炼硫磺得不偿失
    汾西县现有土炼硫磺炉360多座，年产土硫磺1500吨。最近我调查了这个县的6个硫磺厂，发现土法炼硫磺弊多利少，不可盲目发展。
    土法炼硫磺排放大量磺烟，污染环境，影响健康。成家庄硫磺厂周围，不少土地表面有一层白霜样的覆盖物。厂对面的山坡上，原先灌木丛生，现在，已衰败、荒芜。成家庄村200多亩耕地每年减产粮食五六万公斤。
    炼硫磺的废渣排入河沟，污染水源，堵塞河道。每炼1吨硫磺要排7吨废渣。年产1500吨硫磺，就要排1万多吨废渣。成家庄村河边的3眼水井因被硫磺废渣污染报废。村民只好到两公里外担水。
    土法炼硫磺浪费资源。提炼硫磺的回收率仅为30％，每产1吨硫磺，要浪费掉2吨硫磺，1年便要浪费3000吨硫磺。同时，开采出来的大量硫磺粉矿被丢弃了。按当地的硫磺售价，汾西县每年要扔掉价值552万元的硫磺。
