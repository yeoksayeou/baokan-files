	Li Ruihuan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, emphasized today that reform and opening up are historical necessities. Only by continuing reform and opening up can China prosper and become strong.

	The delegation led by Kirk Kerkorian, Chairman of the Board of MGM Enterprises Inc., arrived in Beijing after signing a contract for the development of a land parcel in Tianjin.

	Li Ruihuan said that this land use right transfer contract is the largest project signed by China after the suppression of the turmoil. It is the result of several years of joint efforts by both sides. The signing of the contract has caused a great response both domestically and internationally. Li Ruihuan praised Kerkorian's foresight and expressed his gratitude to the friends who have worked hard for this project.

	Li Ruihuan believes that the signing of this project strongly proves the continuity of China's reform and opening-up policy. Recently, many foreign friends have been concerned or worried about whether China's reform and opening-up policy can continue. He expressed his belief that if these foreign friends come to China to see the actual situation here, these concerns can be quickly dispelled.

	Li Ruihuan said that reform and opening up are necessary for China's modernization drive and are in the interests of the people. The history of the past ten years of reform and opening up has proven that implementing reform and opening up is of great significance for promoting the modernization drive, changing the national appearance, and improving people's lives. On the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, which are the foundation of the state, we must walk the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country. If we have had some problems in the past, it is because we have not done a good job of reform and opening up. As for how to solve the difficulties in the future, we must rely on continuing to do a good job of reform and opening up.

	Li Ruihuan said that opening up to the outside world must be insisted on, and must also be improved and adapted. Undoubtedly, due to our long-term closure, we are not very familiar with the situation abroad, plus the restrictions of economic and other conditions, we are not yet adapted in many aspects such as ideology, style, policy, and measures. Therefore, we must seriously summarize experience, humbly listen to opinions from all sides, and continuously improve the investment environment to make opening up to the outside world better and take bigger steps.

	Li Ruihuan expressed his appreciation for the presence of U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley, who specially went to Tianjin to participate in the contract signing ceremony. He humorously said that he hoped the ambassador would run around more such places and promote more such things, which is very interesting, and its significance may exceed the specific project itself.

	Present at the meeting were Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Li Lanqing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhu Qizhen, Director of the State Land Administration Wang Xianjin, and Vice Mayor of Tianjin Zhang Zhaorui.

    李瑞环会见美MGM商业公司总裁时强调
    只有继续改革开放中国才能繁荣富强
    据新华社北京8月10日电　中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记李瑞环今天晚上在会见美国MGM商业公司总裁马利克波尔时强调，改革开放是历史的必然，只有继续改革开放，中国才能繁荣富强。
    马利克波尔一行是在天津签署了划片开发的合同后来到北京的。
    李瑞环说，这个土地使用权出让合同是在平息暴乱后中国签署的最大的一个项目。这是双方几年来共同努力的成果，合同的签字在国内外引起了很大的反响。李瑞环对马利克波尔的远见表示赞许，对为此项目尽力的朋友们表示感谢。
    李瑞环认为，这一项目的签署有力地证明中国改革、开放政策的继续。最近，有许多外国朋友都很关心或者担心中国的改革、开放政策是否能持续下去。他表示相信，如果这些外国朋友到中国来看看这里的实际情况，这些顾虑就可以很快消除。
    李瑞环说，改革、开放是中国四化建设的需要，也是人民利益的需要。改革开放十年来的历史，大量的事实证明，实行改革、开放对于四化建设的推进、对于国家面貌的改变和人民生活的提高，都具有重大意义。在坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本的前提下，走好改革开放的强国之路，不是哪个人的愿望，而是历史的必然。如果说过去我们出现一些问题，那是因为改革、开放搞得还不够好，而今后的困难如何解决，也要靠继续搞好改革、开放。
    李瑞环说，对外开放必须坚持，也必须改进和适应。毫无疑问，由于我们长期封闭，对国外情况不太了解，加上经济等条件的限制，我们在思想、作风、政策、措施等许多方面还不适应。因此，我们必须认真总结经验，虚心听取各方面的意见，不断改善投资环境，使对外开放搞得更好，步子迈得更大。
    李瑞环对会见时在座的美国驻华大使李洁明专程到天津参加合同签字仪式表示赞赏。他风趣地说，希望大使先生多跑跑这种地方，多促成这类事情，这很有意思，其意义可能超过具体项目的本身。
    会见时经贸部副部长李岚清、外交部副部长朱启祯、国家土地管理局局长王先进和天津市副市长张昭若等在座。
