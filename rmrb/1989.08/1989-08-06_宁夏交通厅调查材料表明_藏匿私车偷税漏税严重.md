Ningxia Traffic Bureau, in collaboration with the Industrial and Commercial Administration, Tax Bureau, and Public Security Bureau, conducted an investigation in 10 counties (cities) and found that many individual car owners, by offering bribes to certain individuals or units, register their cars under government agencies, schools, administrative or public institutions, or mix them into state-owned or collective enterprises. They operate under the guise of public vehicles, evading a significant amount of state taxes. The result is that individuals benefit greatly, the state suffers heavy losses, and the units where the cars are registered gain minor advantages.

According to the investigation by the Ningxia Traffic Bureau in 10 counties (cities), there are 824 such privately owned cars registered under public licenses. In one county, only 8 individual cars are registered, but in reality, there are 82. Roughly estimating, if there are 1,000 such cars evading taxes, the state would lose nearly 5 million yuan annually just from tax evasion.

The methods of tax evasion for cars are numerous. Apart from privately registering under public licenses, there are also cars registered under licenses from other provinces. To avoid the state's "control and management" approval procedures and the 15% "control and management" tax, there are also cases of public cars registered under private licenses. In summary, cars are registered under the licenses of provinces or departments with lower taxes or easier tax evasion.

Currently, the Ningxia Traffic Bureau is taking measures to investigate and recover taxes evaded by individual cars. By July 20th, over 500,000 yuan in various taxes have been recovered.

### 宁夏交通厅调查材料表明  藏匿私车偷税漏税严重

    宁夏交通厅调查材料表明
    藏匿私车偷税漏税严重
    本报银川8月6日电　近日，宁夏回族自治区交通厅和工商、税务、公安等部门一起，对10个县（市）调查研究后发现，许多拥有汽车的个体户给某人或某单位以“好处”，把车靠挂在党政机关、学校、行政事业单位，或混入国营、集体企业之中，打着公车的招牌，大量偷漏国家税收，结果是：个人占大便宜，国家吃大亏，被挂靠单位得小利。
    据宁夏交通厅调查10个县（市）的结果表明，这种私车挂公家牌照的营运汽车多达824辆。有一个县登记的个体汽车只有8辆，而实际有82辆。按交通部门粗略估算，这种偷漏税的私挂公车如果按1000辆计算，光是偷漏税一项，一年国家便损失近500万元。
    汽车偷漏税的名目繁多，除私挂公牌的以外，还有挂外省的牌子的。为逃避国家“控办”审批手续和15％的“控办”税，也还有将公车挂私人牌照的。总之，哪个省（区）或部门交税少，能偷税，就挂哪个部门的牌照。
    目前，宁夏交通部门正在采取措施清查个体汽车漏偷税款，截至7月20日为止，已追回各项税款50多万元。
