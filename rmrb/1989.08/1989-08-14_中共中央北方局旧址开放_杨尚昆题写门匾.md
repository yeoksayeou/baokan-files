The former site of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's North China Bureau has been renovated and enriched with content, and has recently been officially opened to the public. Chairman Yang Shangkun inscribed the plaque for the site. The former site of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's North China Bureau is located in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, in the village of Wujia Yu. The North China Bureau was a dispatch agency of the Central Committee during the Anti-Japanese War. Liu Shaoqi, Yang Shangkun, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Xiaoping successively served as the bureau's secretary.

The renovated former site of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's North China Bureau has restored the former residence of Yang Shangkun, the former secretary of the North China Bureau, and the office of the bureau's organization. Using the attached buildings, a special exhibition hall titled "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's North China Bureau During the Anti-Japanese War" has been established. Through precious historical photographs and revolutionary relics, it re-creates the great revolutionary practice and immortal historical achievements of the North China Bureau in leading the local party in North China, coordinating with the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and the 129th Division, and firmly implementing the party's policy of expanding and consolidating the North China anti-Japanese base areas.

    中共中央北方局旧址开放
    杨尚昆题写门匾
    新华社太原8月14日电　（记者池茂花）中共中央北方局旧址，经过修葺和充实内容，近日正式对外开放。杨尚昆主席为旧址题写了门匾。中共中央北方局旧址在山西武乡县五家峪。北方局是抗日战争时期党中央的派出机关，刘少奇、杨尚昆、彭德怀、邓小平先后任北方局书记。
  这次修葺的中共中央北方局旧址，复原了原北方局书记杨尚昆同志旧居和北方局机关办公室，利用附属建筑举办了《抗日战争时期的中共中央北方局》专题陈列馆，通过珍贵的历史照片和革命文物，再现了北方局在此领导华北地方党，配合八路军总部和一二九师，坚定地执行党的放手发展与深入巩固的方针，开辟与创建华北敌后抗日根据地的伟大革命实践和不朽的历史功绩。
