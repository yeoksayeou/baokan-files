Li Ruihuan and others discuss with representatives of the National Conference on Cleaning Up the Cultural Market
Eliminate Spiritual Poisons  Enrich Cultural Arts
Let Works That the Masses Enjoy Occupy the Artistic Front

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 26th - Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat Li Ruihuan, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and State Councilor Li Tieying held a discussion this morning in Huairentang, Zhongnanhai, with some representatives attending the National Conference on Cleaning Up the Cultural Market, focusing on the issues of cleaning up the cultural market and striving to enrich cultural arts.

Li Ruihuan said, cultural arts are a part of people's lives. With the development of production and the improvement of material living standards, people who are rich seek culture and entertainment. We emphasize serving the people wholeheartedly, improving people's lives, which includes not only material life but also cultural life.

He pointed out that the arts community has a heavy responsibility. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the cultural and arts community has indeed achieved remarkable results. However, due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization, the problems are also very serious. Comrades in the arts community should bravely face the problems and not cover up for each other. Currently, it is an excellent opportunity to revitalize the arts. We must persist in opposing bourgeois liberalization for a long time, take the campaign against pornography seriously, and do it well, but avoid making it too dull. We must unite the broad masses of comrades in the arts community, enrich artistic creation, and occupy the artistic front with things that the masses enjoy and have vitality, making the arts industry flourish with a hundred flowers blooming and full of vitality.

Li Tieying said, all levels of party committees and governments should attach importance to cultural and artistic work. We must oppose and prohibit spiritual poisons that contradict the Four Cardinal Principles and confuse people's minds, and eliminate low-quality cultural dross and garbage. We must actively carry out artistic criticism. We must vigorously promote and support artistic works that inspire the national spirit and encourage people to move forward, thereby improving the cultural quality of the Chinese nation and enriching socialist artistic undertakings. We must unify the economic benefits and social benefits of art, and put social benefits first. Managing the cultural market is a long-term task. We must pay attention to policy guidance and strengthen management according to law.

At the meeting, Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, Gao Di, President of the People's Daily, Zhou Keyu, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and relevant comrades from Jiangsu, Guangxi, Liaoning, Guangdong, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces and municipalities spoke.

    李瑞环等与清理文化市场工作会议代表座谈
    扫除精神毒品  繁荣文化艺术
    让群众喜闻乐见的作品占领文艺阵地
    新华社北京8月26日电  中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记李瑞环，中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映今天上午在中南海怀仁堂同出席全国整顿清理文化市场工作会议的部分代表座谈关于整顿清理文化市场、努力繁荣文化艺术的问题。
    李瑞环说，文化艺术是人民生活的组成部分。随着生产的发展、物质生活水平的提高，富而思文，富而思乐，人民就要求丰富多彩的文化生活。我们强调全心全意为人民服务，改善人民生活，不仅包括物质生活，也包括文化生活。
    他指出，文艺界任务很重。十一届三中全会以来文化艺术界的确取得了显著的成绩，但是由于资产阶级自由化的影响，问题也是很严重的。文艺界的同志要勇敢地正视问题，不要护短。当前，是振兴文艺的极好机会。要把反对资产阶级自由化长期坚持下去，把“扫黄”作为一件大事，认真抓好，但注意不要搞得冷冷清清。要把文艺界的广大同志团结起来，繁荣文艺创作，用群众喜闻乐见的有生命力的东西占领文艺阵地，使文艺事业百花齐放，生机勃勃。
    李铁映同志说，各级党委和政府要重视文化艺术工作，对与四项基本原则相抵触、涣散人心的精神毒品，必须反对、禁止，对低劣的文化糟粕、垃圾必须扫除。要积极开展文艺评论。要大力提倡和扶持振奋民族精神、鼓励人民向上的文艺作品，从而提高中华民族的文化素养，繁荣社会主义文艺事业。要把文艺的经济效益和社会效益统一起来，把社会效益放在首位。管好文化市场是个长期的任务，既要注意政策引导，又要依法加强管理。
    会上，中宣部部长王忍之，人民日报社社长高狄，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任周克玉和江苏、广西、辽宁、广东、上海、四川、湖南等省、区、市的有关同志发了言。
