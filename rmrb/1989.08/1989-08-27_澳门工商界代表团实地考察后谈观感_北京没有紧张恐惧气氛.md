A delegation from Macau's business community, which recently visited Beijing, shared their observations with reporters upon their return.

The delegation's leader, Vice Chairman of the Macau Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Ho Tau Wai, said that visiting Beijing with an open and objective mindset was beneficial for better understanding the lives of Beijing residents, the social atmosphere, and the domestic situation.

During their stay in Beijing, the delegation held meetings and discussions, and also visited joint venture enterprises, the Asian Games Village construction site, and Tiananmen Gate. Ho Tau Wai mentioned that from Tiananmen Gate, one could see soldiers on duty, but their numbers were not large. Some tourists gave them ice cream and took photos with them. He added that the delegation also went for walks, and the overall impression was that the city was calm, society was stable, traffic was smooth, and everything was operating normally. There was no sense of tension or fear.

Delegation members Tao Kai Yu and Ng Fu also shared their observations. According to them, currently, soldiers are only stationed at government buildings, Tiananmen Square, and a few major thoroughfares. These soldiers did not interfere with the daily activities of the citizens. Ng Fu expressed that the business community is most concerned about social unrest and hopes for a stable environment. This trip to Beijing left the impression that the Chinese government understands the situation in Macau and the concerns of its residents, and is committed to maintaining the stability of Macau society.

    澳门工商界代表团实地考察后谈观感
    北京没有紧张恐惧气氛
    据新华社澳门8月26日电　（记者罗照明）刚刚结束对北京参观访问的澳门工商界代表团，昨天在此间向记者介绍了他们此行观感。
    代表团团长、澳门中华总商会副会长何厚铧表示，抱着主动、客观的态度实地看看北京的情况，对进一步了解北京市民生活、社会气氛和国内形势是很有好处的。
    代表团在京期间，除进行会见、座谈外，还参观了中外合资企业、亚运村建设工程以及天安门城楼等。何厚铧说，站在天安门城楼上眺望天安门广场，发现仍有军人站岗，但人数不多，有的游客给他们送冰棍，对着他们拍照。他说，代表团还曾外出散步，总的感觉是市面平静，社会安定，交通畅通，运作正常，没有感到紧张和恐惧的气氛。
    代表团成员陶开裕、吴福也谈了自己的观感。据他们观察，目前北京只是政府机关所在地、天安门广场和若干主要通道，有军人站岗。这些军人并没有干涉市民的日常活动。吴福表示，工商界最担心的是社会动荡，都希望有一个安定的环境。这次北京之行的印象是，中国政府很了解澳门的情况和澳门居民的忧虑，很重视继续保持澳门社会的稳定。
