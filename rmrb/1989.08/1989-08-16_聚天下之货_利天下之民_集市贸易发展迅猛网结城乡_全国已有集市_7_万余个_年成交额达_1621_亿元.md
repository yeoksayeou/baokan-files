In the daily lives of ordinary people, market trading has long ceased to be a mere supplementary activity. According to recent surveys by the National Bureau of Statistics on 106 cities and 140 county towns, urban residents spend an average of 152.28 yuan per year on food purchased from farmers' markets. The proportion of major food items purchased from farmers' markets is as follows: vegetables 73.5%, pork 51.6%, beef and mutton 52.2%, poultry 68.8%, fresh eggs 59.3%, and fish and shrimp 57.4%. Those who once complained about market trading have begun to accept the proliferation of markets with a calm attitude.

Over the past decade, market trading in China has developed rapidly. In 1983, when market trading was just restored, there were 48,803 market points in urban and rural areas, with a trading volume of 38.58 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 13.5% of the national market share. By the end of 1988, there were 71,359 urban and rural markets nationwide, with an annual trading volume of 162.1 billion yuan, far exceeding the growth rate of the national retail sales of state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises. In addition to tens of thousands of comprehensive markets, numerous agricultural and sideline product wholesale markets, industrial small commodity markets, second-hand markets, and recently emerged "futures markets" are scattered across the country, forming a multi-type, multi-level, and multi-functional market trading network that combines large, medium, and small markets and urban and rural areas. Among them, many large and medium-sized market trading centers have become important commodity distribution centers and regional economic activity centers.

    聚天下之货　利天下之民
    集市贸易发展迅猛网结城乡
    全国已有集市7万余个　年成交额达1621亿元
    据新华社北京8月16日电　（实习生徐伟、记者傅刚）在普通百姓的生活中，集市贸易实际上现在已不再是拾遗补缺的“小打小闹”。仅据国家统计局近年对全国106个城市、140个县城的抽样调查，城镇居民从农贸市场购买食品人均年支出达152.28元，在农贸市场上购买主要食品数量占购买总量的比重是：蔬菜73.5％，猪肉51.6％，牛羊肉52.2％，家禽68.8％，鲜蛋59.3％，鱼虾57.4％。昔日抱怨过集贸市场的人，也开始以平静的心态来对待如雨后春笋般的集市。
    近10年，我国的集市贸易得到特别迅猛的发展。就在集贸市场刚刚恢复的1983年，城乡集贸市场网点有48803个，贸易额达385.8亿元，在全国市场上占的份额约为13.5％；到1988年底，全国已有城乡集市71359个，全年成交额达1621亿元，大大超过了国营和合作商业社会零售总额的增长幅度。除了数以万计的综合性集市外，众多的农副产品批发市场、工业小商品市场以及旧货市场、新近出现的“期货市场”星罗棋布、遍布全国，构成了一个大中小结合、城乡结合的多种类、多层次、多功能的集市贸易网络。其中，许多大中型集贸市场已成为重要的商品集散地和区域性经济活动中心。
