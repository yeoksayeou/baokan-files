According to preliminary investigations by the tax authorities, Zhao Xue Ming, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Harbin known for treating psoriasis, has an operating income of over 400 million yuan but has never truthfully reported and paid personal income adjustment tax. The Dao Wai Tax Bureau and the Dao Wai District Procuratorate have decided to recover part of Zhao Xue Ming's personal income adjustment tax amounting to 406,000 yuan.

From January 1987 to June 1989, Zhao Xue Ming collaborated with local hospitals in Beijing and Qingdao to open clinics, earning substantial profits through revenue sharing. Since April 1987, the tax authorities have repeatedly urged Zhao Xue Ming to pay taxes in accordance with the law, issuing him two notices to report personal income adjustment tax this year alone. However, Zhao Xue Ming neither filled out the forms nor voluntarily paid the taxes.

    收入四百万从不交调节税  中医赵学铭被追缴四十万
    新华社北京8月18日电　据税务部门初步查证，以治疗牛皮癣闻名的哈尔滨市中医赵学铭营业收入达400多万元，从未如实申报缴纳个人收入调节税。哈尔滨市道外税务分局和道外区检察分院目前决定，追缴赵学铭部分个人收入调节税40.6万元。
    赵学铭1987年1月至1989年6月分别在北京和青岛与当地医院联合开设门诊，以营业收入分成方式获利累累。1987年4月以来，税务部门多次要赵学铭依法纳税，今年就向他下发两次申报个人收入调节税通知单。但赵学铭既不填写，也不主动交纳税金。
