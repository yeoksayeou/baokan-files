Since Poland liberalized food prices, the market supply situation remains unchanged. Meat and meat products are in severe shortage, with retail prices increasing severalfold. Officials believe that the situation will improve in two months.

The policy of liberalizing agricultural product procurement and sales prices, which began on August 1, is a crucial measure in Poland's economic reform and a strategic task to address the long-term shortage of food. The agreement reached at the Round Table Conference at the beginning of this year indicates that all sectors of Polish society support this measure.

This measure stipulates that from August 1, the policy of state-set prices will be abolished, and commercial entities will be allowed to set prices independently. Only a few types of food, such as the most common bread, baby milk products, and cheese, will maintain their current prices. After marketization, the rationing system that has been in place for 8 years will be abolished, and food subsidies, which account for more than half of the state budget, will be frozen at the current level and gradually reduced until they are eliminated.

Why has the marketization measure not produced the expected results since its implementation? The prevailing view here is that preparation was insufficient and the measure was implemented hastily; propaganda and explanatory work were inadequate; the government did not take necessary intervention measures against some illegal activities, and so on.

What is the prospect of marketization? Government officials believe that after decades of state-set prices, the current liberalization will inevitably lead to some chaos. After 6 to 8 weeks, producers and circulation departments will gain some experience, and the situation will gradually change.

    波兰放开食品价格举步维艰
    新华社记者　马云亮
    自波兰食品价格放开以来，市场供应情况依旧。肉和肉制品供应严重不足，零售价格增长了几倍。官方人士认为，两个月后情况将会趋向好转。
    从8月1日开始实施的农产品收购和销售价格放开的政策，是波兰经济改革的一项重要措施，也是为解决食品长期匮乏的一项战略性任务。今年初圆桌会议达成的协议表明，波社会各界都赞成采取这一措施。
    这一措施规定，从8月1日起取消国家规定价格的政策，改由商业单位自行定价的办法，只有个别几种食品，如最普通的面包、婴儿奶制品、奶酪等的价格仍维持现状。实行市场化以后，即行取消已实行8年的凭票证供应的制度，迄今占国家预算支出一半以上的食品补贴将冻结在现有水平上，以后将逐渐减少，直至取消。
    为什么市场化措施实行以来还没有收到预期的效果？这里较普遍的看法是：准备不足，仓促实施；宣传、解释工作不够；政府对一些违法现象没有采取必要的干预措施，等等。
    市场化的前景如何？政府官员们认为，实行了几十年的官定价格，现在刚刚开始放开，不可避免地会出现一些混乱现象，待6至8周后，生产者和周转部门取得一定经验，情况会逐渐发生变化。　（新华社华沙8月12日电）
