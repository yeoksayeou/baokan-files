Over 200 high-tech projects included in this year's national Torch Program

	BEIJING, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Science and Technology Commission's Torch Center organized experts to carefully review and decided to include 234 high-tech projects in the 1989 national "Torch" program.

	The "Torch" program was launched on August 5, 1988, with 38 projects initially approved, all of which are now being implemented smoothly.

	This year's approved projects were selected from 1,500 applications submitted by research institutes, universities, and factories across the country. The projects are mainly focused on new materials, biotechnology, electronics and information, mechatronics, new energy, and high-efficiency energy-saving technologies. The selection criteria include advanced technology levels, mature technological achievements, good market prospects for the products, the ability to generate foreign exchange through exports or save foreign exchange through imports, a short production cycle (generally 2-3 years), high economic benefits (with an input-output ratio of about 1:5), a tax rate of more than 25%, and significant overall economic benefits compared to general research projects. For example, the "hot isostatic pressing manganese-zinc ferrite gas head material" project is a key achievement from the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" and "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Some of its performance indicators surpass those of similar products from the United States and Japan. The project has a high input-output ratio, with a total investment of 8 million yuan, an expected annual output value of 40 million yuan, an annual tax revenue of 16 million yuan, and the ability to generate 4.2 million US dollars in foreign exchange annually.

	At today's press conference, Vice Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Li Xu'e pointed out that implementing the "Torch" program can quickly commercialize high-tech achievements, which is of great significance for the development of China's high-tech industry and national economic construction. He hoped that all levels of government would provide support in terms of manpower, resources, and funding to promote the development of these projects.

    二百多个高技术科技项目列入今年国家级火炬计划
    本报北京八月五日讯　记者何黄彪报道：国家科委火炬中心组织专家认真评审，决定把二百三十四个高技术项目列入一九八九年国家级“火炬”计划。
    “火炬”计划是一九八八年八月五日开始实施的，当时立项三十八个，现正在顺利实施。
    今年的立项项目是从全国研究院所、高等院校、厂矿企业申报的一千五百个项目中筛选出来的，主要限制在新材料、生物技术、电子信息、机电一体化、新能源、高效节能领域。立项原则是，技术水平先进，技术成果成熟；产品的市场前景好，能够出口创汇或替代进口节汇；投产周期短，一般为二至三年；经济效益高，投入产出比在一比五左右，利税大于百分之二十五，总经济效益大大高于一般科研项目。比如，被立项的“热等静压锰锌铁气体磁头材料”，是国家“六五”、“七五”重点攻关成果，部分性能优于美国、日本同类产品。该项目的投入产出比很高，总投资八百万元，预计年产值达四千万元，年利税一千六百万元，每年可创汇四百二十万美元。
    国家科委副主任李绪鄂在今天的新闻发布会上指出，实施“火炬”计划，能够把高科技成果迅速商品化，对我国高科技的发展和国民经济建设有着重要作用，希望各级政府从人力、物力和财力上予以支持，推动这些计划项目的发展。
