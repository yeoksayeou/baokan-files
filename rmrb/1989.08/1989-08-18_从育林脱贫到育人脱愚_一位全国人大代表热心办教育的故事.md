Who could have imagined that Xu Chuande, a seventh-term National People's Congress representative who transformed thousands of acres of barren mountains into a sea of forests and led tens of thousands of impoverished households to prosperity, still lives in the dilapidated thatched huts left by his ancestors? Moreover, his family does not even have basic modern household appliances like a tape recorder or a bicycle. Recently, he donated the 1,000 yuan he had saved to build a house to support the cause of education and inscribed a motto: "I would rather live in a humble abode forever, but I must let the children of the mountains go to school!" Inspired by him, hundreds of officials and ordinary people generously contributed, and this became a celebrated tale in the impoverished mountain village.

Xu Chuande, 39, is an ordinary farmer from Nan Zhuang Township in Yuexi County, Anhui Province, in the Dabie Mountains. The reforms of the past decade changed his fate, making him a pioneer of labor-led prosperity in the area. However, he remains humble and frugal. A few years ago, he took the lead in generously donating his hard-earned money to transform over 2,000 acres of barren mountains into a sea of forests! Subsequently, he self-funded three trips to Beijing to study science and technology, inventing the green feed concentrate, which saves grain and firewood and shortens the pig-raising cycle. He also adopted methods of teaching techniques, selling at a slight profit, and credit sales to help tens of thousands of impoverished households in the mountainous areas quickly achieve prosperity, becoming a model for poverty alleviation in the entire province. Through his practical experience, he deeply felt that poverty could not be eradicated without addressing ignorance. His hometown, Nan Zhuang Township, has only one dilapidated school. To attend junior high school, one must climb mountains and cross rivers to schools dozens of miles away. Therefore, most children return home after completing primary school, and junior high school students are rare. After being elected as a seventh-term National People's Congress representative, Xu Chuande heard the representatives' passionate speeches on education issues and became increasingly restless: "Education backwardness is the biggest problem in the mountains!"

In April of this year, Xu Chuande returned from a meeting in Beijing and hurried to the township government to propose a plan to raise funds for developing mountain education. With the support of the township leaders, Xu Chuande extensively sought opinions, traversing mountains and valleys to visit all four administrative villages in the township, meeting with party secretaries, village heads, and over 200 party and youth league members. The township party committee and government held a meeting of cadres and the masses for this purpose. Xu Chuande emotionally addressed the fellow villagers: "To alleviate poverty, we must first address ignorance. To revitalize Nan Zhuang Township, we must revitalize education!" He led everyone to "inspect" Nan Zhuang Primary School, where the school buildings were in disrepair, with walls full of cracks and barely standing, supported by wooden poles... Everyone couldn't bear to look. Xu Chuande then said, "What should we do? Should we passively wait, rely on others, and beg, or should we rely on ourselves and find solutions? I have spent the money I earned over the past few years on afforestation, pig farms, and feed factories. Until now, I still live in the old house left by my ancestors. For the sake of revitalizing education, I am willing to donate the 1,000 yuan I saved to build a house!"

"Xu Chuande is right. We should be poor but have dignity. Only by investing in intelligence can we completely eradicate poverty! I will donate 100 yuan!" Retired cadre Zhu Boshen took the lead in expressing his support.

High Bridge Village farmer Zhu Delai walked up to Xu Chuande and said, "Xu Chuande, your green feed concentrate can raise a fat pig in just five months. You gave me the technology to get rich and helped me out of poverty. Now you advocate for education for the sake of future generations. I fully support it and am willing to donate 100 yuan!"

"I haven't discussed it with my wife yet, but I will also donate 100 yuan first!" Huanggang Village farmer Xu Shenghao's words made everyone laugh. He is over 20 years old, already a father of two, and his burden is heavy. Two years ago, his younger son had bone tuberculosis, and he borrowed 2,000 yuan to treat the illness. Thanks to Xu Chuande's support in developing scientific pig farming, he has just paid off the debt.

"I will donate 300 yuan!" Township agricultural technician Xu Zheng is a junior high school graduate and is considered a "high-level intellectual" in the village, so he naturally understands Xu Chuande's approach. ... In this impoverished mountain village, more than 100 people quickly donated. A village doctor who had gone out for medical treatment returned to hear the news and immediately expressed his willingness to follow Xu Chuande's example and donate 1,000 yuan. Even a "poor scholar" in the provincial capital—an Anhui University young teacher—heard the news and donated 100 yuan, and also drafted a call to action, urging more people to extend a helping hand to the Dabie Mountains!

Xu Chuande is still busy raising funds. He has already raised over 30,000 yuan, although this is not a large sum, it is quite an achievement for a poor mountain village still struggling to meet basic needs. Xu Chuande feels the responsibility is heavy. He told the reporter: He will use the funds to restore the township's junior high school and set aside some money as an educational fund to establish a school-run factory, investing all the annual industrial profits into education, such as rewarding outstanding teachers and students, purchasing books, and subsidizing families who cannot afford tuition. He believes that as long as one is sincere, nothing is impossible!

    从育林脱贫到育人脱愚
    ——一位全国人大代表热心办教育的故事
    新华社记者　张传宣
    谁能想到，曾使千亩荒山变成林海，带动万家贫困户脱贫致富的七届全国人大代表徐传德，全家至今还住在老祖宗留下的几间破草屋里哩！而且连收录机、自行车等起码的现代化家庭设备都没有。最近，他又把准备盖房子的1000元拿出来支持教育事业，并立下陋室铭：“我宁愿永远住草屋，也要让山区的孩子都念书！”在他的感召之下，数百名干部群众纷纷慷慨解囊，这在贫困的深山窝里传为佳话。
    39岁的徐传德是大别山区的安徽岳西县南庄乡一个普通农民。十年改革改变了他的命运，成为当地劳动致富的开拓者。但他富而不奢，几年前带头慷慨解囊，用辛苦积累的资金一举把2000多亩光秃秃的荒山变成了林海！接着，他又自费三进北京学习科学技术，发明了节粮又省柴、养猪周期短的长绿牌饲料精，并采取传授技术、微利、赊销等办法帮助数以万计的山区贫困户迅速走上脱贫致富之路，成为全省扶贫的先进典型。他在实践中深深感到：治穷不治愚，穷根难拔除。他的家乡南庄乡只有一所破烂不堪的小学校，上初中就要爬山涉水到几十里外的学校。所以大多数孩子只念完小学就回家，中学生很稀罕。徐传德当选为七届全国人大代表后，听到代表们对教育问题慷慨激昂的发言，更加坐立不安：教育落后才是山区的最大落后啊！
    今年4月，徐传德从北京开会回来，迫不及待地跑到乡政府，提出集资发展山区教育的设想。得到乡领导的支持之后，徐传德又广泛征求意见，翻山越岭跑遍全乡4个行政村，从支书、村长到200多名党团员都访问了。乡党委、乡政府还为此召开了干部群众大会，徐传德十分动情地向乡亲父老们说道：“治穷要先治愚，振兴南庄乡，非得振兴教育不行哪！”他把大伙带到南庄小学“现场观摩”，只见校舍破烂不堪，开着大裂缝的墙壁摇摇欲坠，全靠用树棍支撑着……大家看不下去了。这时，徐传德又说道：“大伙看该怎么办？是消极悲观地‘等、靠、要’，还是自力更生想办法？我这几年挣点钱都花在造林、办猪场、办饲料厂上了，至今住的还是老祖宗留下的破房子，为了振兴教育，我愿意把积攒盖房子的1000元捐献出来！”
    “传德讲得对，咱们穷要穷得有志气，只有舍得智力投资，才能彻底拔掉穷根！我拿100元！”离休干部祝伯存带头表态。
    高桥村农民祝德里走到徐传德面前，说道：“传德，你的长绿牌饲料精养大一头肥猪，只要5个月就能卖了。你把致富的技术给了我，帮我脱了贫，现在又提倡办学为后代着想，我举双手赞成，愿意拿100元！”
     “还没和老婆商量，我也先拿100元！”黄岗村农民徐声号的话把大伙逗笑了。他20多岁，已是两个孩子的爸爸，负担本来就够重了，前年小儿子得骨髓炎，治病借债2000多元。多亏徐传德扶持他发展科学养猪，眼下刚刚还清了债。
    “我拿300元！”乡农民技术员徐正已是中学毕业生，算得上全村的“高级知识分子”了，当然更能理解徐传德的做法。……在这个贫困山乡里，很快就有100多人慷慨解囊。有个乡村医生出门行医去了。回来听说后，也立即表示向传德看齐，捐款1000元。连远在省城的一位“穷秀才”——安徽大学青年教师，闻讯也捐献100元，并且还起草一份倡议书，呼吁更多的人向大别山区伸出热情之手！
    徐传德还在为集资奔走着。他已经筹集了3万多元，尽管这不是什么大数字，但对于一个还在温饱线上挣扎的穷山乡来说，已经很不容易了。徐传德感到责任重大。他告诉记者：他将通过集资来恢复乡办初中，还要留一部分钱作教育基金，搞个校办工厂，把年年的工业利润全投到教育上，比如奖励优秀教师、优秀学生，购买图书，补助交不起学费的困难户等等。他相信，只要心诚，就没有办不成的事情！
