Judging historical political events requires scientific methodological principles. What is the nature of the political event that took place in Beijing over the course of two months? The Party's 13th Plenum and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have clearly pointed out: This was a political turmoil against the Party and socialism, which developed into a counter-revolutionary riot. The nature of this event is the opposition between bourgeois liberalization and the Four Cardinal Principles. Currently, the vast majority of Party members, cadres, and young students understand and support this judgment after studying it. However, there are still many people who do not have a clear understanding of this issue. They generally feel that the vast majority of students' intentions and mainstream are to fight corruption, support reform, and are patriotic, while those with ulterior motives are only a few. How can this be called a political turmoil?

To truly understand this issue, an important point is to use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to observe problems. Engels once said: "History is made in such a way that the final result always emerges from the mutual conflict of many individual wills, and each of these wills, in turn, is the product of many particular conditions of life, and thus there are countless intersecting forces, countless parallelograms of forces, and from this a total result emerges, i.e., a historical event, which can also be regarded as the product of a force acting as a whole, unconsciously and involuntarily. Because the will of any one person is obstructed by the will of any other person, and the final result is something that no one had hoped for." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 4, p. 478) Engels' statement has methodological significance for us today in understanding the objective nature and subjective motives of this event. It tells us that any historical event is not determined by the personal will of the participants. The objective nature of a historical event is not simply determined by the subjective wishes of the masses participating in the event, but rather by the social and historical background of the event, the actual forces that control, utilize, and dominate the development of the event; by their political program and the political goals they aim to achieve; by their methods of action, strategic means, and the consequences of the event.

Take the "Cultural Revolution" as an example. We say that the "Cultural Revolution" was a political turmoil, certainly not because the vast majority of the masses involved were causing turmoil, but mainly because the "Cultural Revolution" was actually utilized and controlled by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique to achieve their political goals of usurping Party power and overthrowing the socialist People's Republic; their methods of action and strategic means were to plot conspiracies, "great democracy," "kick out the Party committee and make a revolution" to the point of beating, smashing, and looting, seriously undermining the rule of law, etc.; the result was to bring serious disasters to the Party and the state, to the people of all nationalities in the country. Although the situation of this anti-Party and anti-socialist political turmoil is not exactly the same as the "Cultural Revolution," in terms of the nature of the problem not being determined by the subjective wishes of the masses involved, it is the same. In this event, a considerable number of young students were involved, but our Party has never said that the vast majority of young students were subjectively motivated to cause turmoil; on the contrary, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly said that the students' demands to fight corruption, punish officials, promote democracy, and deepen reform are consistent with the Party's stance, and are patriotic. Many comrades always simply use this point to misunderstand the nature of the turmoil. In fact, the logic is very simple. This is the same as when we say that the "Cultural Revolution" was a decade of turmoil, but we are not saying that the billions of people involved in the "Cultural Revolution" were all causing turmoil. Therefore, to deeply and correctly understand the nature of this event, we must grasp the Marxist methodological principles, place the event in a specific historical context, and conduct a comprehensive and objective analysis from the social background of the event's occurrence, the political forces that initiated the incident and played a dominant role; their political programs and goals, methods of action, strategic means, and the social consequences of the event.

First, we must look at the background and the political forces that play a dominant role in the turmoil. The occurrence of this political turmoil is not isolated or accidental but has a complex international and domestic background and deep social and historical roots.

From the international background, the reactionary forces in Western countries, led by the United States, have long pursued a strategy of "peaceful evolution," attempting to change China's socialist direction. Before and during this event, they intensified their anti-communist and anti-socialist activities, with "Voice of America" in particular playing a full role.

Domestically, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's passive and wavering attitude towards upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, the bourgeois liberalization trend has been rampant in recent years. Some people openly deny the leadership of the Communist Party, advocate that socialism is not as good as capitalism, and promote "political pluralism," "multi-party system," economic "privatization," and advocate the theory that "Marxism is outdated." Some newspapers and university classrooms spread various social trends of Western bourgeoisie without criticism or analysis, advocating bourgeois extreme individualism, anarchism, money worship, and decadent worldviews, life views, and moral views, causing extreme confusion in ideology. As a result, in the minds of some young students, the only ones worthy of admiration are Sartre, Nietzsche, Freud, James, and even Hitler. As for Marx, Lenin, and socialist, communist, collective, and revolutionary traditions, they have all become objects of ridicule. This situation is an important reason why many young students can be utilized and incited by a few people with ulterior motives. Only by understanding this domestic and international social background can we understand that this political event is the result of the interaction and malignant development of various anti-communist and anti-China and liberalization trends within and outside the Party.

Under the above domestic and international social background, who are the political forces that initiated the incident and played a dominant role in the event? Some people think that the patriotic actions of the vast number of students are the mainstream of the event, and the vast number of students are the political forces that play a dominant role in the event. We believe that this view is very superficial. In fact, the core forces that planned, organized, and directed this event in an organized and premeditated manner are as follows, and they played a dominant role in the entire event.

First, the leaders of the illegal organization "Beida Autonomous Federation" such as Wang Dan, Wu'er Kaixi (and later the "Workers' Autonomous Federation") are the direct organizers and commanders of this event. They are the core figures performing on the front stage and are the political forces that directly control the turmoil.

Second, the masterminds and instigators behind this event are first and foremost people within and outside the Party who have long been stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois liberalization stance and have political ambitions, such as Fang Lizhi and Yan Jiaqi. Next, there are those who collude with hostile forces overseas and abroad. Then, there are a few people within the Party and state organs who provide core secrets to illegal organizations. These people collude with each other, communicate up and down, and have long been preparing ideologically, in public opinion, and organizationally. The "Democracy Salon" at Peking University, planned by Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, is one of the important measures they took to prepare ideologically and organizationally to attack the Party and socialism.

Third, the direct participation of overseas, especially American, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong reactionary forces, has become an important part of instigating and supporting this political turmoil, playing a particularly vile role. The mouthpieces of international reactionary forces such as "Voice of America" have done their utmost to incite, spread rumors, sow discord, and fan the flames. The reactionary forces in Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as the reactionary organization "Chinese Democratic Alliance" overseas, have been involved in the student movement from the beginning. The reactionary organization "Chinese Democratic Party" composed of members of "China Spring" in the United States also wrote letters to incite "to urge the CCP to end its autocratic rule." They have long been in collusion with a few people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance, acting in cahoots.

Fourth, the domestic scum who hate the Party and socialism. A large number of facts have proven that the ringleaders of the criminal activities of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing, especially in the counter-revolutionary riot, are to a considerable extent, criminals who have not been reformed, released after serving their sentences, and remnants of the "Gang of Four," embezzlers, speculators, and profiteers. They harbor deep hatred for the Party and socialism. These people have become the "suicide squads" and "tiger teams" of this political turmoil.

It should be pointed out that the activities of the above-mentioned core members who planned, organized, and directly participated in the turmoil were so rampant because they could not be separated from the support and encouragement of Comrade Zhao Ziyang. When obvious signs of turmoil appeared in Beijing, he always adopted a tolerant and indulgent attitude, which encouraged the formation and development of the turmoil. When the turmoil had already formed and the situation became increasingly serious, he avoided a serious analysis and discussion of the nature of the event, causing the Party and the government to lose the opportunity to stop the turmoil in time. When the turmoil was about to be suppressed, in his speech to the Asian Development Bank representatives on May 4, he expressed opinions completely opposite to the spirit of the Politburo Standing Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, and the April 26 editorial of the People's Daily, which escalated the turmoil and rapidly worsened the situation. Later, he also incited the press to conduct erroneous public opinion guidance and, at the same time, took the opportunity of meeting Gorbachev to deliberately direct the focus of the struggle towards Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This caused the situation in the capital to become increasingly serious, forcing the government to take martial law measures. At this time, a few people who worked around Zhao Ziyang and controlled the core secrets of the Party and the state, out of counter-revolutionary political needs, leaked the martial law secrets to the leaders of the illegal student organizations, making the situation even worse and developing into a counter-revolutionary riot.

The above facts fully illustrate that this turmoil was deliberately instigated by a few people in a planned, organized, and premeditated manner. Among them, those who have long been stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois liberalization stance, those who collude with hostile forces overseas, and those who provide the core secrets of the Party and the state to illegal organizations are the so-called "backbone" of this event. As for the vast majority of young students, although they appear to be on the front line, in reality, most of them are unaware of the truth. Their patriotic enthusiasm to fight corruption and promote democracy was utilized by a few people from the beginning, and their patriotic demands did not become the mainstream of the event.

Second, we must look at the political program and political goals. Everyone knows that to judge the nature of any political event, we must examine the programs and slogans proposed by the planners and organizers, i.e., the political forces that control the event, because these programs are of great importance in determining the nature of the event.

The planners and organizers behind this turmoil are extremely reactionary. They proposed various programs and demands. As early as 1986, Fang Lizhi proposed the program of "complete Westernization" to take the capitalist road. After being criticized in 1987, instead of changing, he became even more brazen, advocating that China "should be dissolved and disintegrated," and raising the treacherous program of being willing to be a traitor to the country. Liu Xiaobo also advocated in Hong Kong that China "needs 300 years of colonial rule" to prosper. He said, "I don't care about patriotism or treason, if you say I am a traitor, I am a traitor." In his four programs, he explicitly proposed to replace public ownership and planned economy with private ownership and market economy. From this, it can be seen that the planners of this turmoil have long taken anti-Party and anti-socialist as their political program.

From the beginning of the student movement, the leaders of the illegal student organization "Beida Autonomous Federation" such as Wang Dan accepted the ideas of these planners. During the turmoil, the "Beida Autonomous Federation" and other illegal organizations that issued orders publicly proposed to negate the program of opposing bourgeois liberalization. On April 18, the leader of the "Beida Autonomous Federation," Wang Dan, threw out nine programs on Tiananmen Square, the core of which was, "Completely negate the 'cleansing of spiritual pollution' and the 'movement against bourgeois liberalization,' and rehabilitate the citizens who suffered unjustly in the movement." Everyone knows that "bourgeois liberalization" has a specific meaning, that is, "negating the socialist system and advocating the capitalist system." The leaders of the "Beida Autonomous Federation" took "negating the opposition to bourgeois liberalization" as their program, which means taking "negating the socialist system and advocating the capitalist system" as their program.

Under the planning and incitement of Fang Lizhi and the main leaders of the "Beida Autonomous Federation," for a time, dark clouds pressed down on the city, and the sky was filled with gloom. Many universities appeared with big-character posters that wantonly attacked and slandered the Party and the government, openly calling for the overthrow of the Communist Party's leadership. In April, the "Tianjin University" "Letter to All Young Students in the Country" posted at Peking University proposed: "Establish a Constitutional Amendment Research Association to remove the 'principles' and 'uphold' from the Constitution that are deeply hated by the people." The big-character poster "China's Hope - Private Ownership Declaration" posted at Beihang University attacked the socialist public ownership system as a "root of evil" and called for "ringing the death knell of public ownership as soon as possible." Some big-character posters slandered "Marxism is equal to utopia." Some big-character posters cursed the Communist Party of China as a "treacherous party," shouting "abolish the Communist Party and implement a multi-party system."

These facts show that negating the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrowing the socialist system, and leading China onto the capitalist road are the political programs and goals of the planners and organizers of this political event. Under such reactionary political programs, the mainstream of various activities can only be anti-Party and anti-socialist political turmoil, and it cannot be any "patriotic democratic movement." This is very clear.

Third, we must look at the methods of action, strategic means, and social consequences. In terms of methods of action and strategic means, whether it is a turmoil or not is relative to the legal system. Without the standard of the legal system, it is impossible to say clearly what is a turmoil and what is not. Therefore, in judging whether a historical event is a turmoil, in addition to looking at the political program of the political forces that control the event, an important standard is to see whether their actions are conducted according to legal procedures. If their political program is correct and their actions are within the legal system, then it is not a turmoil. On the contrary, if their political program is anti-Party and anti-socialist, and their actions violate the legal system, then it is a genuine anti-Party and anti-socialist political turmoil. This student movement developed into a political turmoil, not only because the political program and goals of the planners and organizers were to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert the socialist system, but also because they violated socialist legalism from the very beginning. Therefore, it is appropriate to say that it is an anti-Party and anti-socialist political turmoil.

First, the planners and organizers of the turmoil opposed the Four Cardinal Principles from the beginning, which itself is a violation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Article 1 of our Constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the leadership of the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The socialist system is the fundamental system of the People's Republic of China. No organization or individual may undermine the socialist system." Next, they ignored the abolition of the "Four Bigs" by the Constitution, did not listen to advice, and posted a large number of big and small-character posters on campus; they did not comply with the ten regulations of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee on parades, did not apply for approval, and repeatedly incited and organized large parades; they repeatedly stormed the Party Central Committee and the State Council's location, Xinhuamen; they violated the management regulations of Tiananmen Square and repeatedly occupied the square, affecting the normal conduct of state activities; they established illegal student organizations without registration and "seized power" from legal student unions and graduate student unions; they ignored laws and school regulations, seized offices, seized broadcasting stations, and did whatever they wanted; they created a large number of rumors, bewitched people's minds, and incited the masses... All these methods of action and strategic means are serious violations of the legal system. More seriously, after the martial law was issued, there were still many people, including some students, who disregarded the authority of the martial law, openly seized public vehicles, set up roadblocks, and obstructed military vehicles, seriously affecting and even destroying traffic order. All these extreme anarchist and ruthless trampling of socialist democracy and legalism, can it still be said that it is not a turmoil?

This turmoil has caused huge impacts and losses in the economic, political, cultural, and diplomatic aspects. In Beijing, counter-revolutionary riots occurred, and in many places, there were serious incidents of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing. Politically, it affected the normal progress of China's democratic and legal system construction, and psychologically and ideologically caused unnecessary shocks and chaos among the people. Internationally, it seriously damaged our country's image.

In summary, as long as we insist on using the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and conduct a comprehensive analysis from the above aspects, we can draw the following correct conclusion: This turmoil is absolutely not a "patriotic democratic movement" as some people say, and its mainstream is not a struggle against corruption, but a counter-revolutionary riot and an anti-Party and anti-socialist political turmoil.

    同青年朋友们谈谈认识动乱性质的方法论问题
    郑舍
    判断历史政治事件要有科学的方法论原则
    在北京发生的历时两月的这次政治事件的性质是什么？党的十三届四中全会和邓小平同志已经明确指出：这是一场反党反社会主义的政治动乱，并由政治动乱发展到反革命暴乱。这次事件的性质，就是资产阶级自由化与四个坚持的对立。对于这个论断，目前绝大多数党员、干部、青年学生经过学习是理解的和拥护的。但是，也有不少人对这个问题还认识不清。总觉得广大学生的本意和主流是反腐败的，是支持改革的，是爱国的，别有用心的人只是极少数，怎么能说这是一场政治动乱呢？
    把这个问题真正弄清楚，很重要的一条，就是要用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法观察问题。恩格斯说过：“历史是这样创造的：最终的结果总是从许多单个的意志的相互冲突中产生出来的，而其中每一个意志，又是由于许多特殊的生活条件，才成为它所成为的那样。这样就有无数互相交错的力量，有无数个力的平行四边形，而由此就产生出一个总的结果，即历史事变，这个结果又可以看作一个作为整体的、不自觉地和不自主地起着作用的力量的产物。因为任何一个人的愿望都会受到任何另一个人的妨碍，而最后出现的结果就是谁都没有希望过的事物。”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第4卷，第478页）恩格斯的这个论述，对于我们今天认识这场事件的客观性质和主观动机的关系具有方法论的意义。它告诉我们，任何历史事件，都不是以参加者的个人意志为转移的。一个历史事件的客观性质，并不是简单地取决于参加这一事件的广大群众的主观愿望，而是要看这一事件的社会历史背景，事件发展的过程实际上为哪一种政治力量所掌握、利用和支配；要看他们的政治纲领和所要达到的政治目的；要看他们的行为方式、策略手段以及事件所造成的后果。
    以“文化大革命”为例。我们之所以说“文化大革命”是一场政治动乱，当然不是说被卷入的绝大多数群众搞动乱，而主要是因为“文化大革命”实际上被林彪、江青反革命集团所利用和支配，来达到他们篡党夺权、颠覆社会主义人民共和国的政治目的；他们的行为方式和策略手段，是搞阴谋、“大民主”、“踢开党委闹革命”以至打、砸、抢，严重地破坏了法制等等；其后果是给党和国家，给全国各族人民带来严重的灾难。这次反党反社会主义的政治动乱，情况虽然和“文化大革命”不尽相同，但从问题的性质并不取决于被卷入的广大群众的主观愿望为转移这一点来说是相同的。在这次事件中，有相当多的青年学生被卷入了，但我们党从来未说广大青年学生的绝大多数在主观动机上是想搞动乱；相反，党中央一再说广大学生的反对腐败、惩治官倒、推进民主、深化改革等要求同党的主张是一致的，是爱国的。有不少同志总是简单地根据这一点，对动乱这个性质理解不了。其实，这个道理也很简单，这和我们说“文化大革命”是十年动乱，但并不是说被卷入“文化大革命”的亿万群众都在搞动乱的情况一样。所以，我们要深刻地、正确地认识这次事件的性质，必须掌握马克思主义的方法论原则，把该事件放在特定的历史联系之中，从该事件发生的社会背景，挑起事端并起支配作用的政治力量；他们的政治纲领和目的、行为方式、策略手段以及该事件产生的社会后果等方面进行全面的、客观的分析。
    一要看动乱的背景和起支配作用的政治力量
    这场政治动乱的发生不是孤立的、偶然的，而是有着复杂的国际、国内背景和深刻的社会历史根源的。
    从国际背景来说，以美国为代表的西方国家中的反动势力一直奉行“和平演变”策略，妄图改变中国的社会主义方向。在这次事件以前和事件中，更加紧了反共反社会主义的活动，《美国之音》尤其作了充分的表演。
    在国内，由于赵紫阳同志对坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化采取消极、动摇的态度，使得近年来资产阶级自由化思潮严重泛滥。有些人公开否定共产党的领导，宣扬社会主义不如资本主义，主张“政治多元化”、“多党制”、经济“私有化”，鼓吹马克思主义“过时论”。一些报刊和大学的讲堂上，无批判、无分析地传播西方资产阶级的各种社会思潮，宣扬资产阶级极端利己主义、无政府主义、拜金主义以及腐朽颓废的世界观、人生观、道德观，造成了思想上的极度混乱，以致在一些青年学生的心目中，值得崇拜的只是萨特、尼采、弗洛伊德、詹姆士，甚至希特勒，至于马克思、列宁，以及社会主义、共产主义、集体主义、革命传统等等马克思主义的世界观、人生观、道德观，都成了他们讥笑的对象。这一情况正是很多青年学生所以能被极少数的别有用心的人利用、煽动起来的一个重要原因。只有放在这样的国内外社会背景来认识，才能理解这场政治事件是国内外、党内外各种反共反华和自由化的思潮交互作用、恶性发展的结果。
    在上述的国内外的社会背景下，挑起事端并对事件起支配作用的政治力量是些什么人呢？有人认为，广大学生的爱国行动是事件的主流，广大学生是对事件起支配作用的政治力量。我们认为这种看法是很表面的。实际上，有计划、有组织、有预谋策划和组织这次事件的，是以下几种骨干力量，对整个事件起了支配的作用。
    第一，非法组织“高自联”的头目王丹、吾尔开希之流（以及后来的“工自联”），是这次事件的直接组织者、指挥者，他们是在前台表演的骨干人物，是对动乱起直接支配作用的政治力量。
    第二，这次事件的幕后策划者、挑动者首先是方励之、严家其等党内外长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的怀有政治野心的人。其次，是同海外、国外敌对势力相勾结的人。再次，是党和国家机关内部极少数向非法组织提供核心机密的人。这几种人相互勾结，上下串通，作了长期的思想上舆论上和组织上的准备。由方励之、李淑娴等一手策划的北京大学的“民主沙龙”，就是他们进行思想、组织准备，向党向社会主义发起进攻的重要措施之一。
    第三，国外、海外特别是美国、台湾、香港等地的资产阶级反动势力的直接参与，成为挑起和支持这次政治动乱的重要方面军，起了特别恶劣的作用。“美国之音”等国际反动势力的喉舌，极尽煽动、造谣、挑拨离间、推波助澜之能事。台湾、香港反动势力以及在国外的反动组织“中国民主联盟”从一开始就插手学潮。由在美国的“中国之春”成员组成的反动组织“中国民主党”，也写信煽动“促使中共结束其专制统治”。他们与极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，也早有勾结，狼狈为奸。
      第四，国内仇视党和社会主义的社会渣滓。大量的事实已经证明，这次政治动乱中尤其是反革命暴乱中，猖狂进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀等各种犯罪活动的首要分子，相当大的部分是没有改造好的、曾被劳改的犯罪分子和刑满释放分子，“四人帮”的残渣余孽，贪污盗窃、投机倒把分子，等等。他们对党和社会主义充满了仇恨。这些人成了这次政治动乱的“敢死队”、“飞虎队”。
    应当指出，以上几种策划、组织和直接参与动乱的骨干分子的活动，之所以如此猖狂，是与赵紫阳同志的支持纵容分不开的。在北京出现明显的动乱迹象时，他一直采取容忍和放纵的态度，助长了动乱的形成和发展。在动乱已经形成、事态日益严峻时，他回避对事件的性质进行认真的分析和讨论，使党和政府丧失及时制止动乱的时机。在动乱接近平息的时候，他在5月4日和亚行代表的讲话中，发表了同中央政治局常委、邓小平同志讲话和《人民日报》4月26日社论精神完全对立的意见，使得动乱升级，事态急剧恶化。以后，他又煽动新闻界进行错误的舆论导向，同时又利用会见戈尔巴乔夫的机会，有意识地把斗争矛头引向邓小平同志。致使首都局势越来越严重，迫使政府不得不采取戒严的措施。这时，在赵紫阳身边工作的极少数掌握党和国家核心机密的人，出于反革命的政治需要，向非法学生组织的头头泄漏了戒严的机密，使得事态更加恶化，以致发展到反革命暴乱。
    以上这些事实充分说明，这次动乱是极少数人有计划、有组织、有预谋地挑起来的。其中，那些长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，同海外敌对势力相勾结的人以及向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人，是支配这次事件的所谓“运动中坚”。至于广大的青年学生，从表面上看，他们是站在第一线的，实际上他们中的绝大多数人是不明真相的。他们反对腐败、推进民主的爱国热情一开始就被极少数人利用，他们的爱国要求并没有成为事件的主流。
    二要看政治纲领和政治目的
    大家知道，判断任何一次政治事件的性质，必须考察事件的策划者和组织者，即对事件起支配作用的政治力量所提出的纲领、口号，因为这些纲领对于确定事件的性质有着十分重要的作用。
    这次动乱的幕后策划者、组织者是极其反动的。他们提出了多方面的纲领、要求。方励之早在1986年就提出“全盘西化”的走资本主义道路的纲领。1987年受到批评后，不仅不改，反而变本加厉，鼓吹中国“要解散、要解体”，打出了甘当亡国奴的卖国主义纲领。刘晓波也在香港鼓吹中国“需要三百年殖民地”，才能繁荣起来。并说：“我无所谓爱国、叛国，你说我叛国我就叛国”。在他的四条纲领中，就明确提出要用私有制、市场经济代替公有制、计划经济。由此可见，这次动乱的策划者，早就把反党反社会主义作为他们的政治纲领。
    学潮从一开始，非法学生组织“高自联”的一些头头如王丹之流就接受了这些策划者的思想。在动乱中，发号施令的“高自联”等非法组织，公开提出否定反对资产阶级自由化的纲领。4月18日，“高自联”的头头王丹在天安门广场抛出了9条纲领，其中最核心的是，“彻底否定‘清理精神污染’、‘反对资产阶级自由化运动’，为在运动中蒙受不白之冤的公民平反。”大家知道，所谓“资产阶级自由化”有其特定的含义，即“否定社会主义制度，主张资本主义制度”。“高自联”的头头把“否定反对资产阶级自由化”作为自己的纲领，就是把“否定社会主义制度，主张资本主义制度”作为自己的纲领。
    在方励之及“高自联”主要头目的策划和煽动下，一时间，黑云压城，阴霾满天。不少高等学校都出现了肆意攻击和诋毁党和政府、公然号召推翻共产党领导的大字报。4月份，在北大张贴的“南开大学”《告全国青年学生书》中就提出：“成立修改宪法研究会，除去宪法中为人民所深恶痛绝的‘原则’和‘坚持’”。在北航贴出的《中国的希望——私有制宣言》的大字报，则攻击社会主义公有制是“祸根”，号召“早日敲响公有制的丧钟”。有的大字报污蔑“马克思主义等于乌托邦”。有的大字报谩骂中国共产党是“一代奸党”，叫嚣“取消共产党，实行多党制”。
    这些事实说明，否定共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，把我国引向资本主义道路是这次政治事件策划者、组织者的政治纲领和目的。在这样的反动政治纲领支配下的各种活动，其主流只能是反党反社会主义的政治动乱，而不可能是什么“爱国民主运动”，这是很清楚的。
    三要看活动方式、策略手段和社会后果
    从活动方式和策略手段来说，是否是动乱，是相对法制而言的。离开法制的标准，就说不清楚什么是动乱，什么不是动乱。因此判断一个历史事件是否是动乱，除了要看支配事件的政治力量的政治纲领以外，一个重要的标准，就是看他们的行动是否按法制的程序进行。如果他们的政治纲领是正确的，又是在法制范围内的活动，当然就不是动乱。相反，如果在政治纲领上是反党反社会主义的，而在行动上又破坏了法制，那就是名副其实的反党反社会主义的政治动乱。这次学潮发展到政治动乱，不仅是因为事件的策划者、组织者的政治纲领和目的是要推翻共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度，而且从一开始就严重违反了社会主义法制。因此，说它是一场反党反社会主义的政治动乱是恰如其分的。
    首先，动乱的策划者、组织者一开始就反对四项基本原则，这本身就是违背中华人民共和国宪法的。我国宪法第一条规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。社会主义制度是中华人民共和国的根本制度，禁止任何组织或者个人破坏社会主义制度。”其次，他们不顾宪法对“四大”的废除，不听劝阻，在校园内大量张贴大、小字报；他们不遵守北京市人大常委会关于游行的十条规定，不经申请批准，不断地鼓动并组织大游行；他们接连冲击党中央和国务院所在地新华门；他们违反天安门广场的管理规定，多次强行占据广场，影响到国事活动的正常进行；他们不经登记成立非法学生组织，向合法的学生会和研究生会“夺权”；他们不顾法纪和校纪，抢占办公室，抢占广播站，想怎么干就怎么干；他们大量制造谣言、蛊惑人心、煽动群众……，这一切的活动方式和策略手段都是严重违反法制的。更为严重的，是在戒严令发布以后，还有不少人，包括一部分学生，无视戒严令的权威，公然抢夺公共车辆，设置路障，拦阻军车，严重影响以至破坏交通秩序。所有这种极端无政府主义的、粗暴践踏社会主义民主和法制的行为，难道说还不是动乱吗？
    这场动乱在经济、政治、文化、外交等各方面造成了巨大影响和损失。在北京发生了反革命暴乱，不少地方发生了打、砸、抢、烧、杀等恶性事件，在政治上影响了我国民主法制建设的正常进程，在人民群众的心理上、思想上造成不应有的震荡和混乱，在国际上严重损害了我们国家的形象。
    总之，只要我们坚持运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，从上述几个方面进行全面分析，就可以得出以下正确结论：这场风波绝不是如一些人所说的那样是“爱国民主运动”，它的主流也不是什么“反腐败”的斗争，而是一场反党反社会主义的政治动乱和反革命暴乱。
