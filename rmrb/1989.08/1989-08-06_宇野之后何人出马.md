The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) suffered a crushing defeat in the House of Councillors election, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Ueno. The LDP is now in the process of selecting its third leader for the year. According to Japanese customs, the head of the majority party in the Diet is the natural choice for Prime Minister. In other words, the LDP president also represents the image of the Japanese government. Therefore, the attention on the new LDP president is not limited to within the party.

In the past, when selecting a new president, the LDP usually prioritized faction leaders, with backroom deals among factions determining the outcome. Many informed individuals have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with this practice. This time, the LDP did not follow the tradition of the outgoing president nominating a successor but instead opted for an election through anonymous voting by party members in the Diet. This is a choice made by the LDP in the aftermath of its defeat in the House of Councillors election and under pressure from the business community to nominate a new leader. According to the election rules, faction activities should be limited, and a candidate needs the support of 20 Diet members to run. In reality, the faction dynamics within the LDP have once again played a decisive role.

Similar to the circumstances when Ueno took office, the consideration of presenting a clean image led to the major faction leaders of the LDP, who were involved in corruption scandals, reluctantly giving up this opportunity. Among the 405 LDP Diet members, the Takeshita faction has 105 members. The Abe faction, considering future cooperation with the Takeshita faction, expressed a willingness to coordinate actions. The two factions, combined, form the main force influencing the selection of the new president. Initially, there was strong support within the party for Secretary-General Hashimoto Ryutaro. However, Takeshita faction chairman Kanemaru Shin instructed Hashimoto not to run, and Hashimoto complied. The five major factions within the party—Takeshita, Abe, Miyazawa, and Nakasone—all announced that they would not nominate candidates from their own factions, shifting the focus to the Kawamura faction's two candidates: 78-year-old Kawamura Toshio and 58-year-old Kaifu Toshiki. Kawamura, aware of his limited political future, was eager to run. However, the Takeshita and Abe factions persuaded him to refrain, emphasizing the need for a younger candidate. Without the support of the major factions, Kawamura had to abandon his plans and instead support his younger colleague Kaifu Toshiki, who received the approval of the Takeshita and Abe factions. The Miyazawa faction, displeased with the dominance of the Takeshita and Abe factions, joined forces with the Nishizawa faction to nominate Hayashi Yoshiro as a counter-candidate. The younger and middle-aged members of the "Liberal Reform Alliance" were also dissatisfied with the major factions' manipulations and hastily nominated Ishihara Shintaro. The media speculated that the formation of three candidates reflected the rifts within the LDP factions and the increasing democratic atmosphere and policy debates within the party.

An initial comparison of the three candidates shows a lack of distinct personalities and similar political views. None of the three have held significant roles within the LDP, such as Secretary-General or Chairman of the General Affairs Committee. They have also not held key positions in the cabinet, such as Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, or International Trade and Industry. The LDP's promotion of these individuals is not a good sign, often serving as a temporary measure rather than a long-term plan. In policy debates, all three candidates echoed the same sentiments: the LDP faces its greatest crisis, political reform is a crucial issue; listening to the voices of the people, amending the consumption tax; protecting domestic agricultural foundations, opposing the liberalization of rice imports, etc., all aligning with the LDP's promises during the House of Councillors election.

On the 8th, the new president will be elected by vote. Kaifu Toshiki hopes to secure more than half of the votes in the first round. Hayashi Yoshiro expects that no candidate will secure more than half in the first round, allowing for a reversal in the second round. Ishihara Shintaro anticipates a dramatic change in the anonymous voting. On the 9th, the new Prime Minister of Japan will be nominated in an extraordinary session of the Diet. The opposition parties, holding a majority in the House of Councillors, may propose another candidate for Prime Minister. Although the LDP, with its majority in the House of Representatives, has the advantage, the selection of the new Prime Minister will not be smooth.

Even before the new president and Prime Minister are determined, the LDP has already begun the behind-the-scenes struggle for cabinet positions. The Japanese public is concerned about how much real change the new leadership can bring to the country's politics.

    宇野之后何人出马
    本报记者　于青
    日本自民党在参院选举中惨败，宇野首相引咎辞职。自民党开始物色本年内第三任总裁。按照日本惯例，议会中占多数议席政党的首脑是内阁总理大臣的当然人选。换言之，自民党总裁也代表日本政府的形象。因此，关注自民党新总裁人选的并不局限于自民党内。
    过去自民党物色新总裁，通常是优先考虑派阀首领，派阀之间经过幕后交易产生。对此有识之士多次表示不满。这次自民党未采取由前任总裁指名后任的作法，改为通过该党国会议员无记名投票选举。这是自民党在参院选举惨败，财界暗示推举新人的非常时期，迫不得已的选择。按照选举规则，应该限制派阀活动，有20名国会议员推荐就可成为总裁候选人。事实上是自民党内的派阀力学决定论的故伎重演。
    与宇野上台时的背景相同处是，考虑到给人廉洁形象，牵涉利案丑闻的自民党主要派阀首领对这次机会只好忍痛割爱。在405名自民党国会议员中，竹下派占105名。安倍派念及日后有求于竹下派，表示与竹下派协调行动。两派联手，形成左右新总裁人选的主要势力。最初党内拥立干事长桥本龙太郎呼声较高。竹下派会长金丸信指示桥本不要出马，桥本只得言听计从。党内五大派中的竹下、安倍、宫泽和中曾根派都宣布不推荐本派候选人，注意力自然转向河本派的两个人选：78岁的河本敏夫和58岁的海部俊树。河本自知政治生涯来日无多，跃跃欲试。竹下安倍两派出面劝告河本自重，着眼年轻人。河本失去主要派阀支持，只好打消出马念头，转为推举同派后辈海部俊树，并得到竹下安倍两派首肯。宫泽派对竹下安倍两派左右大势愤愤不平，不甘心本派无所作为，遂联合二阶堂派推出林义郎与之对抗。中青年议员组成的“自由革新联盟”也对主要派阀指手划脚不满，匆匆推出石原慎太郎。舆论认为，形成3人竞选之势，既反映出自民党派阀之间和派内之中存有裂痕，也表明自民党内民主气氛和政策论争有所增加。
    比较3个候选人的初步印象是，缺少鲜明个性，政见大同小异。3人在自民党内部都未曾担任过类似干事长、总务会长等实力角色。在内阁中也未任过大藏、外务和通产大臣等重要职务。自民党内的破格提拔并非吉兆，多属权宜之计，并非长期打算。3人在政策论争中异口同声，无不是本党面临最大危机，政治改革是重要课题；倾听国民呼声，修改消费税；保护国内农业基础，反对大米进口自由化等等，与自民党在参院选举中的许诺如出一辙。
    8日投票选举新总裁。海部俊树希望一举获得过半数选票。林义郎期待第一次投票都不过半数，第二次投票中形势逆转。石原慎太郎企盼无记名投票出现有利于自己的戏剧性变化。9日在临时国会指名选举日本新首相。在野党在参院占多数议席，可能提出另外的首相候选人。虽然最终自民党占多数议席的众院有优先权，但新首相的产生也不会一帆风顺。
    新总裁和新首相还没问世，自民党内已开始进行瓜分内阁大臣交椅的幕后活动。日本广大民众关心的是，不论谁上台执政，对改变三流政治到底能做多少实事。
