The book "A Study of the Models of China's Economic System Reform," published by the Chinese Social Sciences Press, is another new achievement from the project "A Comprehensive Plan for China's Characteristic Economic System," led by Liu Guoguang and involving a group of renowned scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The book, with approximately 500,000 words, is innovative in its intent and broad in its scope, providing a systematic discussion on the reform of the economic system.

The book is divided into two parts, a preface, and an appendix, totaling 16 chapters. The first part focuses on the target model of the reform, while the second part analyzes the methods and paths of model transformation under a dual system, forming a complete strategic vision.

The target model is a strategic direction for the reform. As early as 1983, Liu Guoguang categorized the socialist economic system into five models: the military communist supply system, the traditional centralized planned economic system, the improved centralized planned economic system, the planned economic system that combines planning and market regulation, and the "market socialism" model. At that time, Liu Guoguang proposed the fourth model as the target model for China's reform. This book advances Liu Guoguang's original idea in three aspects. First, it adds an intermediate model, the indirect administrative control model, which indicates that the abolition of direct administrative control does not mean the establishment of an indirect control system through the market. Second, the author previously described the "target model" of the reform as a "planned economic model with market mechanisms," but the book describes it as a "market-coordinated model with macro-control under planning guidance." Third, the book adheres to the framework that the system model can be divided into five structural factors, providing a new summary of the target model from five aspects: ownership structure, decision-making system, economic interest system, economic regulation system, and economic organization system.

Regarding the transformation of models, Liu Guoguang essentially has three principles: the principle of gradualism, the principle of coordination, and the principle of the buyer's market. The book provides a detailed explanation and argument for these three principles. The author disagrees with the "rapid transition theory" and advocates for the "gradual transition theory." The author argues for the deep coordination between ownership reform and operational mechanism reform. The author also proposes several strategies to create a buyer's market during the reform process.

The coexistence of dual systems is the fundamental starting point for studying model transformation. The author believes that the coexistence of dual systems is not a result of our subjective errors but a necessary stage in the evolution of China's system. The author analyzes the various frictions and contradictions that arise from the coexistence of dual systems while fully affirming the positive significance of this coexistence.

Under the dual system, how can we strengthen macro-control and governance while preventing a reversal? The author proposes two strategies: "dual-channel control and mutual penetration" and "relative separation of two mechanisms." The term "dual-channel control and mutual penetration" refers to the state's use of planning regulation in one part of economic activities and market regulation in another part, with these two parts being mutually penetrating. The term "relative separation of two mechanisms" refers to defining boundaries for the traditional mechanism and the market mechanism to reduce the contradictions and frictions caused by the dual mechanisms and to minimize speculative behavior.

The book is based on the historical process of contemporary economic changes, grasping the conditions and foundations for the transformation of economic system models from the entire economic development system. It proposes a comprehensive plan for the simultaneous transformation of economic development models and economic system models. The author points out that, like the transformation of system models, the transformation of economic development models cannot be achieved overnight and similarly involves contradictions and frictions between two development models. The contradictions of dual development models and dual systems intertwine, creating a very complex situation. On one hand, the inertia of the old development model and the old system model mutually reinforce each other. On the other hand, during the dual transformation, management vacuums appear between the new and old systems, and the new and old development models appear out of sync, with the expansion of the old and the new, leading to excessive demand, shortages, and inflation, making both transformations fraught with difficulties. The author proposes that to reduce friction and govern the environment, not only should the reform strategy be adjusted, but the development strategy should also be adjusted.

    《中国经济体制改革的模式研究》评介
    肖杜
    中国社会科学出版社出版的《中国经济体制改革的模式研究》，是由刘国光主持、中国社会科学院一批知名学者参加的《中国特色的经济体制的总体设想》课题中的又一新成果。全书约50余万字，立意新颖，视野开阔，是一部系统地论述经济体制改革的专著。
    全书分上、下两篇，一个代序，一章附录，共16章。上篇集中阐述了改革的目标模式，下篇集中分析了双重体制下模式转换的方式和途径，形成一套完整的战略构想。
    目标模式是改革的战略方向问题。早在1983年，刘国光曾将社会主义经济体制划分为五种模式，即军事共产主义供给制的模式；传统的集中计划经济模式；改良的集中计划经济模式；计划调节与市场调节有机结合的计划经济模式；“市场社会主义”模式。当时，刘国光以第四种模式为我国体制改革的目标模式。本书从三个方面推进了刘国光原来的设想。其一，增添了一个中间性模式，即间接行政控制模式。它表明废除了直接指令的行政控制，并不等于通过市场所进行的间接控制制度的建立；其二，著者对改革的“目标模式”过去曾表述为“含有市场机制的计划经济模式”，本书则表述为“在计划指导下有宏观控制的市场协调模式”；其三，本书坚持体制模式可分为五个结构因素的框架，从所有制结构、决策体系、经济利益体系、经济调节体系与经济组织体系等五个方面对目标模式进行了新的概括。
    关于模式转换，刘国光实际上有三条原则，即渐进原则、配套原则和买方市场原则。本书对这三条原则作了详尽的阐发和论证。作者不同意“快速过渡论”，主张“逐步过渡论”。作者论证了所有制改革和运行机制改革两个基本方面的深层配套关系。作者提出了在改革进程中创造买方市场的若干对策。
    双重体制并存是研究模式转变问题的基本出发点。作者认为，双重体制并存并不是我们的主观失误，而是我国体制演变的必然阶段。作者分析了双重体制并存出现的各种的摩擦和矛盾，同时也充分肯定了双重体制并存的积极意义。
    在双重体制下如何既加强宏观控制、治理环境，又防止走回头路？对于这个问题，作者提出了两条对策，一条叫做“双渠调控、互相渗透”；另一条叫做“两种机制相对分割”。所谓“双渠调控、互相渗透”，是指国家在一部分经济活动中以计划调节为主，在另一部分经济活动中以市场调节为主，同时这两部分又是相互渗透的。所谓“两种运行机制相对分割”，是指为传统机制和市场机制各自划定界限，以减少双重运行机制产生的矛盾和摩擦，减少投机行为。
    本书立足于当代经济大变动的历史进程，从整个经济发展的大系统来把握经济体制模式转换的条件和依托，提出经济发展模式和经济体制模式同步转换的总体设想。作者指出，与体制模式转换一样，经济发展模式的转换也不可能一蹴而就，同样存在着两种发展模式的矛盾和摩擦。双重发展模式的矛盾与双重体制的矛盾交织在一处，形成十分复杂的局面。一方面，旧的发展模式与旧的体制模式的惯性互相强化；另一方面，双重转换中，新旧体制之间出现管理真空，新旧发展模式之间出现错落，旧的扩张加上新的扩张冲动，酿成需求过度膨胀、短缺加剧、通货膨胀，使双重转换都难免发生许多困难。作者提出，为减少摩擦，治理环境，不仅要调整改革战略，也要调整发展战略。
