Call for Submissions: National Day Reportage Literature

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. To commemorate this significant occasion, the Literature Department of our newspaper, in collaboration with the Jilin Chemical Industry Company, has decided to jointly organize a "National Day Reportage Literature" writing contest.

Content and Requirements: The contest focuses on the 40-year history of building a new life under socialism, led by the Communist Party of China. Participants are encouraged to vividly depict the achievements of the Chinese people from all ethnic groups. The works should not only review the victories already achieved but also look forward to the new paths that lie ahead. Special attention should be given to the tremendous achievements made in various fields over the past decade of reform and opening up. The writing should capture the spirit of innovation and the struggles of the people in creating new situations. Submissions should be between 3,000 to 6,000 words, with a maximum length of 9,000 words per piece. We eagerly await works that are thought-provoking, insightful, substantial in content, diverse in form, and unique in style.

Submission Guidelines: Selected submissions will be published, and renowned writers and critics will be invited to serve as judges to evaluate and award outstanding works. Please send your manuscripts to "People's Daily Literature Department National Day Reportage Literature Contest Group." Do not submit the same manuscript to multiple contests. Submitted manuscripts will not be returned.

Submission Period: From today until December 31, 1989.
