The international civil aviation market is currently experiencing unprecedented prosperity. Concurrently, competition among major aircraft manufacturers is intensifying.

Last year, the global number of air passengers reached 1 billion, and it is projected that this number will continue to grow over the next 10 years. By the year 2000, global air passenger traffic is estimated to double compared to last year.

The bustling air travel industry has led airlines worldwide to rush to order new aircraft. From 1985 to 1988, global aircraft orders totaled nearly 3,200 units, breaking the record set in the late 1960s when large jetliners first appeared. Boeing, the dominant player in the Western aircraft manufacturing industry, saw its aircraft orders increase by 70% in 1987 compared to 1984, and by another 70% the following year. This year, just in the first quarter, the order volume has already reached last year's total. Since the Boeing 707 entered service in 1958, Boeing has successively introduced new models such as the 737, 747, 757, and 767, maintaining a leading position in the international market. Currently, 60% of jetliners in operation are Boeing products. However, the Airbus, jointly produced by the UK, France, and West Germany, poses a significant threat to Boeing. The Airbus not only boasts advanced technology and efficient production lines but also receives substantial subsidies from the governments of the UK, France, and West Germany, enabling it to sell shares at low prices and consistently succeed in the stock market. In the early 1980s, the intense competition between the American McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Lockheed Corporation resulted in both companies suffering significant losses. Consequently, Lockheed's L-1011 TriStar aircraft was withdrawn from the market in 1984, and McDonnell Douglas was severely weakened. McDonnell Douglas is now working to resolve production issues with its stretched MD-11 model, which, once solved, will be a strong competitor to the Boeing 747.

Boeing's strategy remains focused on innovation. The company is expected to launch new models, the 767-X and the 747-400. The 767-X has 350 seats, slightly smaller than the 747. The 747-400 increases the range of the original 747 and fully implements electronic navigation screens in the cockpit, replacing the original 600-plus instruments and indicator lights with 9 electronic computer screens. The number of crew members has also been reduced from three to two. Currently, Boeing is recruiting specialists from companies like Lockheed to ensure the delivery of 57 Boeing 747s this year. In the production of the 747-400, Boeing aims to maximize deliveries by using engines from Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, and Rolls-Royce.

The Airbus's current production volume is not large, but it is stable. Its main challenge in competition is to strengthen financial management and reduce production costs. In April of this year, the governments of the UK, France, and West Germany decided to reduce the number of board members from 17 to 5 and to appoint a dedicated financial manager. McDonnell Douglas has also reorganized the company, reducing the number of managers. Its main competitive strategy is pricing; for example, the MD-80, which competes with the Boeing 737, is priced at $31 million, $6 million cheaper than the Boeing 737, while the MD-11, similar to the Boeing 747, is priced at $100 million, $20 million cheaper than the Boeing 747.

Despite the current favorable market conditions, major aircraft manufacturers are not complacent. As the president of Boeing said, "The boom created by large orders presents a rosy picture, but this rose is not within easy reach."

    国际民用客机市场的竞争
    本报记者  朱满庭
    目前，国际民航客机市场正处在前所未有的繁荣时期。同时，各大飞机制造公司之间的竞争也日渐激烈。
    去年，全世界飞机乘客达10亿人次，预计今后10年内乘客人数还会持续增长。到2000年，全世界的航空客运量估计要比去年翻一番。
    繁忙的客运业务使各国航空公司争相定购新客机，1985年到1988年，全世界的客机订货近3200架，打破了60年代末大型喷气客机问世以来的纪录。在西方客机制造业中执牛耳的波音公司，客机订单1987年比1984年增加了70％，去年一年又增加了70％，而今年仅头一个季度订货量就达到去年全年的水平。自1958年波音707型客机投入运营，波音公司又相继推出了737、747、757、767等新机型，在国际市场上一直遥遥领先，目前的喷气客机中60％是波音产品。不过，由英国、法国和联邦德国联合生产的空中客车对波音已形成威胁。空中客车不仅拥有先进的技术和高效率的生产线，而且从英、法、联邦德国政府得到高额补贴，使它得以用低价出售股票，在股票市场上一向得手。美国麦克唐纳——道格拉斯公司和洛克希德公司在80年代前期的激烈竞争中两败俱伤，结果洛克希德公司生产的L—1011三星式飞机在1984年退出了市场，麦道公司也大伤元气。麦道现正力图解决加长的MD11型生产中的问题，一旦这些问题解决，MD11将是波音747的有力竞争者。
    波音的战略仍是以新取胜。这家公司正可望推出767—X型和747—400型的新品种。767—X型有350个座位，比747略小。747—400型则加大747原有的航程，并且在驾驶舱全部实现导航仪表屏幕化，用9个电子计算机屏幕代替了原有的600多个仪表和指示灯。驾驶机组人员也由原来的3个减为两个。目前，波音正从洛克希德公司等处吸收有专长的人员，以确保今年57架747型机的交货。而在747—400型的生产中，波音为了最大限度地供货，已准备使用美国普拉特·惠特尼公司和通用电器公司以及英国罗斯·罗伊斯公司制造的发动机。
    波音的主要对手空中客车的产量目前不大，但生产稳定。它在竞争中面临的主要问题是加强财政管理，把生产费用压缩下来。今年4月，英、法、联邦德国三国政府决定将董事会成员由17人减至5人，并专门设立主管财政的领导人。麦道公司也对公司进行了改组，压缩了经理人数。它的主要竞争方式在于价格，如与波音737抗衡的MD80型售价3100万美元，比波音737便宜600万美元，而类似波音747的MD11售价1亿美元，比波音747便宜2000万美元。
    尽管当前市场情况良好，但各大飞机制造公司都不敢稍有懈怠，正如波音公司总裁所说：“大量订单形成的景气，使人眼前呈现出一片玫瑰色，但这玫瑰并非垂手可得。”
