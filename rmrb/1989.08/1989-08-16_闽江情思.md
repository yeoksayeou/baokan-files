    Thoughts on the Min River

    Zhu Guzhong

    The river valley stretches for a thousand miles, dotted with villages as densely as ancient lotus seeds;
    The sky and water meet in a single line, echoing the unbroken village accents of thousands of years;
    Gazing closely at the riverbank, the rocky peaks and caves are like scrolls of flying blue and red wall paintings;
    Looking down at the vast waters, the clear light and colorful clouds seem like bundles of swirling, radiating brushstrokes…

    Ah, Min River, fearless of mountains and peaks blocking your path, clouds and mist shrouding you, the ancient small boats that once scattered laughter, the carefree small boats, and the bitter hearts of wise men in turbulent times, the lonely gazes of unmatched women, where have they all sunk?
    And the beautiful, dreamlike fallen leaves on both banks, the monkey calls that stir the heart, the oar songs and mountain tunes, the washing women scattering a river of longing, where can they be found?

    Only the francolins are seen, flying and hiding…
    Only the new moon is seen, silently…

    Ah, Min River, absorbing the waters of a hundred rivers and eternal joys and sorrows, the rugged boatmen, who with their scorching sweat, forged a winding path through treacherous waters; the standing boat girls, who with their pink sleeves, adorned the dreams of many travelers; thinking of the ten years of plunder, the bloody winds from all sides, already buried in the river bottom, rotted into mud, the surging tides that shook the heavens, the waves that struck fear into hearts, pushed out how many dramas of rebirth from ruin? The fine waves touched by swallows, the gentle waves with the warbling of orioles, how many human wonders have they reflected?

    Again, the colorful clouds are seen, drifting everywhere…
    Again, the red sun is seen, burning brightly…

    Min River, Min River, as beautiful as a painting, as clear as a melody, as poetic as a poem, you approach the azure of the sea, you penetrate the depths of history; you forever record the changes of wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning, you forever convey the symphony of heaven, earth, and man; you forever flow in time.

    Flowing gently in the depths of people's eyes;
    Pouring magnificently into the hearts of people…

    闽江情思
    朱谷忠
    峡谷千里，散布着古莲子一般稠密的村落；
    水天一线，喧响着数千年不绝如缕的乡音；
    细眺江岸，岩峰石窟如幅幅飞青施朱的壁画；
    俯首沧波，晴光霞彩似束束回旋辐射的排笔……
    啊，闽江，不畏山堵峰截、云遮雾裹的闽江，那古时洒下浅笑的舴艋，放浪飘逸的小舟，以及乱世贤臣愤懑的心境、绝世处子孤独的目光，是在何处沉泯？而两岸美如幻梦的落木，叩人心弦的猿声，以及桨楫哼起的山歌小曲、浣女撒下的一江相思，又该去哪里追寻？
    只见鹧鸪，飞来隐去……
    只见新月，寂然不语……
    啊，闽江，容纳百川雪水、万古悲欢的闽江，那粗犷的纤夫，曾以滚烫的汗水，趟出险道不尽的逶迤；那亭立的船女，曾以淡红的衣袖，装饰多少游人的梦境；想十年劫掠、四野腥风已被埋入江底，萎成烂泥，那气势惊天的大潮，慑人心魄的涌浪，曾推出多少百废俱兴的活剧？那紫燕轻点的细浪，黄莺婉转的柔波，又叠映了多少人间的奇景？
    又见彩云，四处飘绕……
    又见红日，尽情燃烧……
    闽江，闽江，画一般秀丽、曲一般明快、诗一般优美的闽江啊，你向大海的蔚蓝逼近，你向历史的纵深渗透；你永远记录着风云雷电的变化，你永远传递着天、地、人的交响曲；你永远在时间中流淌。
    温柔地流淌在人们的眼波深处；
    壮美地倾泻在人们的胸臆之中……
