On June 3rd, Mr. Takashima Toshio and Ms. Ishida Yoneko accompanied us to visit the former site of Okayama Sixth High School, where Guo Moruo studied—now known as Okayama Asahi High School.

Guo Moruo spent ten years studying in Japan. In September 1915, after studying for a year and a half at the preparatory course of Tokyo First High School, he came to Okayama Sixth High School. He spent three years here. The school was destroyed by American bombing in June 1945. Seventy years later, the former site of Okayama Sixth High School, of course, no longer retains its original rustic charm. However, we still paid our respects to every blade of grass and tree here, imagining Guo Moruo's footsteps from years past.

I carefully examined the transcript of Guo Moruo's (then known as Guo Kaizhen) three years of study at Okayama Sixth High School, which Ms. Ishida Yoneko had prepared for us. Since he was preparing to study medicine, and Japanese medical education at the time was heavily influenced by Germany, his German language courses took up a significant portion of his studies. His German grades were as follows: 85, 71, 84 in the first year; 72, 87, 82 in the second year; 68, 75, 82 in the third year. His English grades were: 70 in the first year, 74 in the second year, and 93 in the third year. Additionally, there were grades for mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, and physical education. His average score over the three years was 73.5. Through this transcript, I truly felt the tenacity and thirst for knowledge of a poor and lonely Chinese student. He completed all the courses here and, in the summer of 1918, successfully enrolled in the medical department of Kyushu Imperial University.

In the school grounds, we gazed at the lush Mount Sōja, which made the campus even more beautiful. Guo Moruo often climbed this mountain during his free time. Among the pine trees and strange rocks, he recited poems by Tagore and Heine, inspiring a surge of creativity, and wrote passionate or delicate poems.

At the foot of Mount Sōja stands a stone inscribed with a poem by Guo Moruo, which he wrote in the summer of 1975 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of Okayama Sixth High School: "Ascending the slopes of Mount Sōja, the pine paths wind; Thinking of home, I gazed towards the horizon. Today, the four seas are my home, but I still miss Mount Sōja more than home."

In the afternoon, we visited Okayama Kōrakuen. This is one of Japan's three famous gardens. The artificial hills, strange rocks, pavilions, tea gardens, ponds, and plum groves within the garden are elegant and harmonious. In the winter of 1955, Guo Moruo led a delegation from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to visit Japan. Amid his busy schedule, he specially revisited Okayama Kōrakuen, cherishing deep feelings for the garden. While searching for familiar sights, he remembered the "U Castle"—an old black castle near the garden—and the red-crowned cranes. Unfortunately, both the "U Castle" and the red-crowned cranes were destroyed in World War II. Okayama Prefecture Governor Miki Kōji said, "Red-crowned cranes are rare in Japan, and it's difficult for us to obtain them. It's likely that this garden's famous sight will never be seen again." Guo Moruo immediately expressed that he would send a pair of red-crowned cranes to Kōrakuen upon his return to China. He wrote a poem at the request of his Japanese friends: "Kōrakuen still stands, but U Castle is gone. I wish to present red-crowned cranes, to stand by the plum grove." The following July, Guo Moruo indeed sent a pair of red-crowned cranes. Ms. Ishida Yoneko pointed out, "Look, the red-crowned cranes have bred several generations. This can also be said to be a symbol of everlasting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China!" Several cranes stood tall, spreading their wings, excitedly running back and forth, as if welcoming the Chinese guests from Beijing who had come to visit Guo Moruo's former residence.

    冈山纪行
    黄侯兴
    6月3日，高岛俊男先生与石田米子女士，陪同我们来到冈山朝日高等学校——原郭沫若的母校冈山第六高等学校旧址参观访问。
    郭沫若留学日本10年。1915年9月，他在东京第一高等学校预科学习一年半后，来到冈山六高读书，在这里度过了3个春秋。六高于1945年6月被美军炸毁。时隔70年，眼前六高旧址，当然不复是昔日乡镇素朴的风貌了，不过我们依然怀着一种敬意凭吊这里的一草一木，在遐想中追寻郭沫若当年走过的足迹。
    我细细翻看了石田米子女士预先为我们复制的一份郭开贞
  （即郭沫若）在六高就读3年的学业成绩单。因为准备学医，而日本医学当年以德国为祖，所以德语课时所占比重较大。德语分数：第1学年85、71、84，第2学年72、87、82，第3学年68、75、82；英语分数：第1学年70，第2学年74，第3学年93。此外还有数学，动物植物，物理，化学，体操等课的成绩。3学年的总平均是73.5分。……透过这份成绩单，我真切地感受到了一个贫困而孤寂的中国留学生勤奋上进的顽强毅力与求知精神。他终于修完了这里的全部课程，于1918年夏如愿地考入九州帝国大学医学部。
    在校园里，我们眺望郁郁苍苍的操山——它把校园装点得更加瑰丽多姿。郭沫若当年于课余时常常一个人登山游玩。在松林中、怪石旁，他吟诵泰戈尔的诗、海涅的诗，迸发了汹涌澎湃的灵感，一胸舒畅，写下了激愤的或婉约的诗篇。
    操山脚下，矗立一块诗碑，上面镌刻着郭沫若于1975年夏为纪念冈山六高建校70周年题赠的七绝一首：“陟坡操山松径斜，思乡曾自望天涯。如今四海为家日，转忆操山胜似家。”
    下午，我们游览了冈山后乐园。这是日本著名的3大公园之一。园内的假山、怪石、亭阁、茶园以及池塘、梅林，显得古朴典雅，错落有致。1955年冬，郭沫若率中国科学院代表团访问日本，在百忙中特意重游冈山后乐园，对此园怀有一片深情，而且在寻觅自己所熟悉的一切时，竟能忆起“乌城”——园旁一座乌色的古城堡和丹顶鹤。可憾的是，“乌城”和丹顶鹤都毁于二次大战了。冈山县知事三木行治先生说，“丹顶鹤在日本很少，我们很难弄到，以后这公园的‘一景’怕再也见不到了。”郭沫若当即表示，回国后一定送一对丹顶鹤给后乐园。他应日本友人的请求，赋诗一首：“后乐园仍在，乌城不可寻。愿将丹顶鹤，作对立梅林。”翌年7月，郭沫若果真送去了一对丹顶鹤。石田米子女士指指点点说：“你们看，丹顶鹤已经繁殖好几代了，这也可以说是日中两国人民世世代代友好的象征罢！”几只鹤鸟昂着首，舒展两翼，兴奋地来回跑动，好像在欢迎从北京郭沫若故居来访的中国客人哩！
