    In recent years, economic crimes have become quite serious. However, the number of economic crime cases handled by the people's courts has been decreasing year by year. According to our court's statistics, in 1986, the two levels of courts in the entire city handled 200 economic crime cases. In 1987, 150 cases were handled, a decrease of 25%; in 1988, 123 cases were handled, a decrease of 18%. The central government's policy of severely cracking down on economic crimes has not changed, and economic crimes are on the rise. Why has this anomalous phenomenon occurred? The main reasons are as follows: First, the phenomenon of substituting fines for criminal penalties is serious. Some administrative departments do not transfer cases that constitute economic crimes to judicial organs but only impose fines, allowing criminals to go free. Second, the methods used by economic criminals are becoming more concealed, and their counter-investigation tactics are becoming more sophisticated. Once a case is discovered, they cover for each other, making investigation and evidence collection very difficult.

    In the work of rectifying the economic environment and economic order, this strange phenomenon in economic cases should be given attention by relevant departments.

### 安阳市出现反常现象——犯罪活动有增无减  受理案件逐年下降

    安阳市出现反常现象——
    犯罪活动有增无减  受理案件逐年下降
    近几年，经济犯罪问题相当严重。然而，人民法院受理的经济犯罪案件数却逐年下降。据我院统计，1986年全市两级法院受理经济犯罪案件200件，1987年受理150件，下降25％；1988年受理123件，下降18％。中央从重从严打击经济犯罪方针没有变，经济领域中犯罪活动有增无减，为何出现这一反常现象？究其原因，一是以罚代刑现象严重。对构成经济犯罪的案件，有些行政部门不向司法机关移送，只作罚款处理，从而使犯罪分子逍遥法外。二是经济犯罪分子作案手段日趋隐蔽，为逃避罪责，反侦查手段愈来愈高。一旦案发，相互包庇，使侦查、取证十分困难。
    在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序工作中，经济案件中这一怪现象，应引起有关部门重视。
