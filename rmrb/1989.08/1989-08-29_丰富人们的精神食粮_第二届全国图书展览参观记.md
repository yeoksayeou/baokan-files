In recent days, the China International Exhibition Center in the northeastern suburbs of Beijing has become a gathering place for book lovers. The Second National Book Exhibition is being held here, showcasing the finest books published in China over the past decade. Every day, it attracts tens of thousands of visitors.

In the comprehensive exhibition hall featuring books selected by over 500 publishers, or in the exhibition rooms meticulously arranged by each publisher, readers from various industries can find their intellectual companions. Whether carefully examining the large volumes on the shelves or casually flipping through the small booklets on the display tables, visitors from all regions can discover their favorite new books. A small sign in the exhibition hall highlights the significant changes in China's publishing industry from 1979 to 1988: the number of publishers increased from 129 to 500, the number of book titles from 17,000 to 65,000, the number of books printed from 4 billion to 62 billion, and the number of printed pages from 17.2 billion to 26.9 billion.

Quantity is one aspect of development, but quality is the more important achievement. Here are a few examples from the exhibition hall to give a glimpse:

- The 60-volume second Chinese edition of the *Collected Works of Lenin* has already published over 40 volumes. This set is edited by China, with complete materials and accurate translations, and has a refreshing light green cover.
- The 60-volume *Complete Collection of Chinese Art* has been fully published, with exquisite binding that stands out in the exhibition hall. This massive work presents a snapshot of China's 5,000-year civilization through images.
- The *Flora of China* and *Fauna of China* published by the Science Press total over 100 volumes and are renowned in the international academic community.
- The *Chinese Buddhist Canon* published by Zhonghua Book Company has already published 30 volumes, and the complete works of Liang Qichao, *Yingbingshi Collection*, have been fully published, both of which are important accumulations of national culture.

Series books are a major feature of China's publishing industry over the past decade. The *World Classics in Translation* series by Commercial Press has already published 250 titles, with excellent selections and meticulous editing. Other series include *20th Century Foreign Literature*, *Contemporary China*, *Chinese Major Crops Cultivation*, and *Youth Encyclopedia*.

Another feature is the variety and practicality of dictionaries and reference books. The exhibition includes *China Encyclopedia*, *Concise Britannica Encyclopedia*, and *Chinese Dictionary*, among others.

Over 30 publishers from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau have also brought more than 1,000 books to the exhibition, adding color to the book fair.

The crowded sales area and the large number of orders at the ordering counter show the public's demand for books. On the first day of the exhibition, nearly one million books were ordered, with a total value of 2 million yuan. The sales area sold 3 million yuan worth of books in the first three days.

Although the Chinese publishing industry has faced some challenges in recent years, the trend of reform and opening up, with an abundance of good books, is very clear. This can be strongly felt in the exhibition hall.

The book exhibition is also a place for authors, editors, and readers to exchange ideas. When discussing the current situation in the publishing industry, many people share a common view: the problem of poor-quality books flooding the market must be thoroughly changed. The rectification work should both "cut off the source" from the publishers and "intercept the flow" from bookstalls. At the same time, they hope that the central government will guide cultural and economic policies to support the mainstream of publishing good books. Some publishing industry leaders say that we cannot publish everything at once, nor can we stop publishing anything at once. Moving from one extreme to another is harmful to the publishing industry. The central leaders' views on both rectification and the need for a vibrant and prosperous industry are very appropriate for the publishing industry. The publishing industry must seize this opportunity to use the mainstream of good books to wash away the muddy waters.

    丰富人们的精神食粮
    第二届全国图书展览参观记
    袁晞
    北京东北郊的中国国际展览中心这些天成了读书人汇聚的地方，第二届全国图书展览在这里举办，十年间中国出版的图书精品在这里荟萃，每天都吸引着上万观众。
    在五百余家出版社精选图书集中的综合馆，或是在每个出版社精心布置的版别室，各行各业的读者都能看到自己案头的知识伴侣；仔细瞧瞧书架上的大部头，或是信手翻翻展台上的小册子，各地的观众总能发现自己喜爱的新书。展厅中的一块小牌子标出了我国出版业从一九七九年到一九八八年十年间的大变化：出版社由一百二十九家增至五百家，图书品种由一万七千多种增至六万五千多种。图书印数由四十亿册增至六十二亿册，图书印张由一百七十二亿印张增至二百六十九亿印张。
    数量是发展的一个方面，质量是更重要的实绩，这里举几个展厅中见到书籍以斑窥豹：
    ——六十卷的《列宁全集》中文第二版已出书四十多卷，这套书由我国自己编辑，资料齐全、译文准确，淡绿色的封皮颇为清新；
    ——《中国美术全集》六十大本全部出齐，精美的装帧在展厅中十分惹眼。这部巨卷以图版形象展现出中国五千年文明史的缩影；
    ——科学出版社的《中国植物志》和《中国动物志》多达百余卷，享誉国际学术界；
    ——中华书局的《中华大藏经》已出三十册，梁启超全集《饮冰室合集》已出齐，都是重要的民族文化积累。
    丛书是十年中国出版界的一大特色，商务印书馆的《汉译世界学术名著丛书》已出二百五十种，选题好、编辑精。还有《二十世纪外国文学丛书》、《当代中国丛书》、《中国主要农作物栽培学丛书》、《少年百科丛书》等。
    辞书工具书品种多、实用性强也是特色之一，展品中有《中国大百科全书》、《简明不列颠百科全书》、《汉语大词典》等。
    台湾、香港、澳门的三十多家出版社也拿来一千多种图书参展，为书展增色。
    销售部拥挤的人群、订货处大量的成交都显示出人们对书的需求，开展第一天，订货处就订书近百万册，售价达二百万元；销售部前三天就卖出三十万元的书籍。
    尽管中国出版界近年有股股浊水，但改革开放，好书倍出的主流十分明显，在展厅中能强烈地感到这一点。
    书展也是图书作者、编者和读者交流的场所，谈到目前出版界的状况，许多人有共同的看法，认为坏书充斥图书市场的状况必须彻底改变，清理整顿工作要一面从出版社“断源”，一面从书商书摊“截流”，同时希望中央在文化经济政策的导向上利于出好书的主流。一些出版界负责同志说，我们不能一下子什么都出，也不能一下子什么都不让出，从一个极端到另一个极端对出版界都是有害的，中央领导同志既要清理整顿，也要活跃繁荣的观点对出版界非常适当，出版界一定要把握契机，用出好书的主流冲走污泥浊水。
