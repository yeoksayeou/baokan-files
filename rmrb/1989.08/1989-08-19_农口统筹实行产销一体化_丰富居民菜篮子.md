The Tianjin municipal government began in 1978 to boldly explore and implement production and sales integration reforms for dairy, aquatic products, pork, poultry eggs, and vegetables. A new system was established where the agricultural department is responsible for the overall management of the production and sales of subsidiary food products. This system combines responsibility, authority, and benefits, implements macro-control over the production and sales of subsidiary food products based on market demand, and solves the problems of disconnection between production and sales and mutual blame between agricultural and commercial sectors. It has formed a stable production of subsidiary food products, a rich market, and stable prices. Currently, the production of major subsidiary food products basically meets the supply needs of urban and rural areas. Poultry eggs and vegetables have been self-sufficient for several years; aquatic products, especially freshwater fish, have achieved the goal of "struggle for three years, eating fish is not difficult" proposed by the municipal government in 1985, one year and a half ahead of schedule, reaching basic self-sufficiency; meat and dairy production are also developing steadily with ample supply.

    农口统筹实行产销一体化
    丰富居民菜篮子
    本报讯　天津市政府从1978年开始，大胆探索，相继对牛奶、水产品、猪肉、禽蛋和蔬菜实行了产销一体化的改革，建立了由农口一家统筹负责副食品产销管理的新体制。它集责、权、利于一身，根据市场需求，对副食品产销实施宏观控制，解决了副食品产销脱节、农商两家相互扯皮的弊端，形成了副食品生产稳定，市场丰富，价格平稳的局面。目前，主要副食品生产基本满足了城乡供应，禽蛋、蔬菜已连续几年自给有余；水产品，特别是淡水鱼，提前一年多实现了市政府在1985年提出的“奋战三年，吃鱼不难”的目标，达到基本自给；肉类和牛奶生产也稳步发展，供给充足。
