Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 13th.

Shanghai's publishing industry has vigorously developed foreign book copyright trade. Over the past ten years, it has collaborated with 101 overseas publishers to publish 579 books, earning over 15 million yuan in foreign exchange.

According to the Shanghai Copyright Office's Ren Yan and Wang Weiwei, in the first half of this year, Shanghai's foreign copyright trade continued its upward trend, with 43 formal contracts signed and plans to co-publish 167 books. Key projects include Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House collaborating with Hong Kong Zhonghua Book Company to release the 1989 new edition of "Cihai" (a comprehensive Chinese dictionary), and with Taiwan's Donghua Book Company to co-publish a new edition of "Cihai" combined volume, with the latter alone earning tens of thousands of dollars. Parts of the "Hanyu Da Cidian" (Chinese Dictionary) will be published in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Continuous exploration has enabled Shanghai's publishing industry to gradually grasp the "pulse" of the global book market. Overseas audiences are interested in various topics related to Chinese culture and eager to understand the current state of China's science, technology, culture, and economy. After timely adjusting these topics, overseas publishing counterparts have eagerly collaborated. Shanghai Science and Technology Publishing House, at the Frankfurt International Book Fair, sought out copyright trade partners to offset the losses from publishing academic monographs domestically with income from copyright transfers. "China's Five Thousand Years of Costume" was co-published and later translated into French, English, and German editions, winning multiple international awards. Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House collaborated with Hong Kong and Taiwan counterparts to publish "Years and Landscapes - Illustrated History of China," which has been well-received overseas. It is reported that some Shanghai-published books have been translated into 12 languages for global readers.

Shanghai's foreign copyright trade is currently diversifying. Shanghai Translation Publishing House adopts a "two-way" approach, both importing and introducing, achieving good results.

    上海发展对外版权贸易
    已同海外合作出书579种获利1500万
    据新华社北京8月13日电（记者李光茹）上海出版界大力发展对外书刊版权贸易，十年间同海外101家出版社合作出版图书579种，已获利1500多万元外汇人民币。
    据上海市版权处任彦、王伟卫介绍，今年上半年上海对外版权贸易仍持上升趋势，已正式签约43份，拟合作出版167种图书。重点合作项目有上海辞书出版社同香港中华书局携手推出1989年新版《辞海》，同台湾东华书局合出新版《辞海》合订本，仅后一项的收益就有几十万美元；《汉语大词典》部分卷将分别在香港、台湾出版。
    不断地摸索，使上海出版界逐渐掌握了世界图书市场的“脉搏”。海外公众对中华文化的多种选题感兴趣，渴望了解中国科技、文化、经济等方面的现状，他们及时调整这类选题后，海外出版同行纷纷与之合作。上海科技出版社在法兰克福国际图书博览会上，注意寻找版权贸易合作伙伴，用版权转让中的收入，弥补国内学术专著出版的亏损。《中国服饰五千年》合作出版后，先后被译成法、英、德文版，并在国际上多次获奖。上海古籍出版社同香港、台湾同行合出的《岁月河山——图说中国历史》，在海外赢得了赞誉。据悉：一些沪版图书已被译成12种语言呈现于世界读者面前。
    上海的对外版权贸易目前已向多样发展。上海译文出版社采取“双向制”，既输入又引进，收到良好效果。
