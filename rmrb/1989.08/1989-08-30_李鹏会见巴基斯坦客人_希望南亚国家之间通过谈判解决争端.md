Li Peng Meets with Pakistani Guests
Hopes for Negotiated Resolution of Disputes Among South Asian Countries

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 30th - Premier Li Peng met with Pakistani Defense Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister Imtiaz Ali and his delegation this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People.

Ali conveyed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's warm greetings to Li Peng. He said that Prime Minister Bhutto, the Pakistani government, and the Pakistani people are eagerly looking forward to Premier Li Peng's official friendly visit to Pakistan in the latter half of this year.

Li Peng asked Ali to convey his greetings to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Li Peng said, "China and Pakistan have a long history of friendly relations. Since Benazir Bhutto took office as the head of the Pakistani government, she has pursued a policy of continuing to develop friendly relations with China. For the matter of China suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in June this year, the Pakistani government and people have expressed understanding and sympathy, and we appreciate this."

When discussing the situation in South Asia, Li Peng said, "All South Asian countries are developing countries and all face the task of developing their economies. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between them. Many of the disputes among South Asian countries are historical legacies that can and should be resolved through peaceful negotiations." When discussing the Cambodian issue, he said, "The international conference on the Cambodian issue held in Paris is in its final day. Due to the rigid stance of Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime, it seems the conference will not achieve the expected results. To justly and reasonably resolve the Cambodian issue, China is willing to continue making efforts with all relevant countries."

    李鹏会见巴基斯坦客人
    希望南亚国家之间通过谈判解决争端
    新华社北京8月30日电　李鹏总理今天下午在人民大会堂会见了巴基斯坦总理国防事务顾问伊姆蒂亚兹·阿里一行。
    阿里向李鹏转达了贝·布托总理的亲切问候。他说，布托总理、巴基斯坦政府以及巴基斯坦人民殷切期待着李鹏总理今年下半年对巴基斯坦的正式友好访问。
    李鹏请阿里转达他对贝·布托总理的问候。李鹏说，中国和巴基斯坦有着悠久的友好关系。贝·布托担任巴基斯坦政府首脑以来，奉行继续发展同中国友好关系的政策。对今年6月中国平息反革命暴乱一事，巴基斯坦政府和人民表示理解和同情，我们对此表示赞赏。
    在谈到南亚地区的形势时，李鹏说，南亚国家都是发展中国家，都面临发展经济的任务，相互间没有根本的利害冲突。南亚国家之间的争端，许多都是历史遗留下来的问题，完全应该也可以通过和平谈判来求得解决。他在谈到柬埔寨问题时说，在巴黎举行的柬埔寨问题国际会议已经到了最后一天，由于越南和金边政权的顽固立场，看来会议不会达到预期结果。为了公正、合理地解决柬埔寨问题，中国愿意和各有关国家继续作出努力。
