	Various Countries Continue to Focus on the Higgins Incident
	U.S. Welcomes Suspension of Execution of Another Hostage
	Israel Plans to Use Military Force
	South Yugoslavia Condemns Violence and Terrorist Activities

	BEIJING, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) — The Shiite Muslim group holding American hostages announced today that it has suspended the execution of another hostage. U.S. President Bush expressed his happiness and encouragement over the decision. White House spokesman Fitzwater issued a statement saying that this development is encouraging and full of hope, but added that it has not resolved the plight of foreign hostages in Lebanon. The statement called on all parties in the Middle East to use their influence to stop the kidnapping of hostages and release all those still being held.

	For nearly three days, the hostage crisis has been troubling the U.S. authorities. After the killing of U.S. Marine Corps Colonel William Higgins, another American hostage, Terry Anderson, faced the threat of execution. The U.S. had engaged in diplomatic contacts with more than a dozen countries to rescue American hostages. Meanwhile, the U.S. has deployed warships in the waters near Lebanon and Iran, preparing for possible military action. It is reported that the U.S. government has discussed a military action plan. If Anderson is killed, the U.S. President is prepared to order the Sixth Fleet's aircraft to attack terrorist bases in Lebanon, with one target being the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek, where Shiite Muslim militias and Iranian Revolutionary Guards are stationed. Today, after the Shiite group announced the suspension of the hostage execution, the U.S. announced that it has temporarily shelved its air strike plan.

	CAIRO, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) — The Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram today revealed that Israel is planning military action to resolve the current hostage crisis.

	The report said that Israel is preparing to invade Lebanon and is seeking U.S. approval for the operation.

	The report said that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has asked the U.S. to participate in the invasion to retaliate against the Lebanese Muslim group for hanging American hostage William Higgins and further threatening the life of a second hostage.

	According to the plan, Israel will launch a combined land, sea, and air attack on southern Lebanon to eliminate some organizations in the region, including Lebanese, Iranian, and Palestinian groups.

	According to the plan, Israel will attempt to avoid conflict with Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon.

	Israel has also requested that the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean provide cover for Israel's sea and air operations.

	MOSCOW, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) — Soviet Foreign Ministry First Deputy Director of Information Perfiliev said at a news conference today that on August 2, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, at the request of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Jack Matlock, discussed the current situation in Lebanon.

	Perfiliev said that the Soviet Union firmly opposes the escalation of violence and condemns any terrorist actions. The Soviet Union has taken and will continue to take active measures to prevent new crimes. The Soviet Union advocates the immediate release of all hostages being held in Lebanon.

	BELGRADE, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) — Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Vajger today issued a statement to domestic and foreign reporters on the hostage tragedy in the Middle East, saying that Yugoslavia strongly condemns the recent terrorist actions on Lebanese territory and expresses deep sorrow for the victims. Vajger pointed out that the killing of UN peacekeeping forces officer Colonel William Higgins and the kidnapping of Hezbollah leader Obeid are aimed at opposing the peace process in the Middle East and Lebanon. It also aims to add difficulties to the peaceful resolution of the extremely complex and worrying situation in this non-aligned country, which is contrary to the principles of international law and the standards of human civilization.

    各国继续关注希金斯事件
    美欢迎暂停处死另一人质
    以色列计划使用军事手段
    苏南谴责暴力与恐怖活动
    本报华盛顿8月3日电  记者张启昕报道：扣押美国人质的什叶派穆斯林组织今天宣布暂停执行处死另一名人质的决定，美国总统布什对此表示高兴和鼓舞。白宫发言人菲茨沃特发表一项声明称，这是令人鼓舞和充满希望的事态发展，但又称这并未解决在黎巴嫩的外国人质的困境。声明要求中东地区各方运用他们的一切影响停止绑架人质，并释放所有仍被扣留的人质。
    近3天来，人质危机困扰美国当局。在美国海军陆战队中校希金斯被杀害，美国另一名人质西西皮奥的生命受威胁之际，美国曾同十几个国家进行外交接触，拯救美国人质。与此同时，美国在黎巴嫩和伊朗附近海域集结军舰，准备采取可能的军事行动。据报道，美国政府已讨论了一项军事行动计划，如果西西皮奥被杀害，美国总统准备命令第六舰队的海上飞机空袭在黎巴嫩的恐怖分子基地，其中一个目标是驻有什叶派穆斯林民兵和伊朗革命卫队的黎巴嫩东部城镇——巴勒贝克。今天在什叶派组织宣布暂停处死人质之后，美国宣布暂时搁置其空袭计划。
    新华社开罗8月3日电  埃及《华夫脱》报今天透露，以色列正计划采取军事行动解决当前的人质危机。
    报道说，以色列正准备入侵黎巴嫩，并要求美国为此行动“开绿灯”。
    报道说，以色列总理沙米尔要求美国参与入侵行动，以报复黎巴嫩穆斯林组织绞死美国人质希金斯和进一步威胁第二名人质生命安全的行动。
    报道说，根据这项计划，以色列将对南黎巴嫩采取陆、海、空联合进攻，消灭在这一地区的黎巴嫩、伊朗和巴勒斯坦的一些组织。
    根据此计划，以色列将试图避免同驻扎在黎巴嫩的叙利亚军队发生冲突。
    以色列还要求美国在地中海的第6舰队向以色列的海、空行动提供庇护。
    新华社莫斯科8月3日电  苏联外交部新闻局第一副局长佩尔菲利耶夫3日在新闻发布会上说，8月2日，苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽应美国驻苏联大使马特洛克请求接见时，双方讨论了当前黎巴嫩局势。
    佩尔菲利耶夫表示，苏联坚决反对暴力升级，并谴责任何恐怖主义行动。苏联过去和现在都采取积极措施，以防止新的罪恶行径。苏主张立即释放所有在黎巴嫩被扣押的人质。
    本报贝尔格莱德8月3日电　记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫外交部发言人瓦伊格尔就中东劫持人质的悲剧向国内外记者发表声明说，南斯拉夫最强烈地谴责最近在黎巴嫩领土上的恐怖主义行动，并对其受害者深表哀悼。瓦伊格尔指出，杀害联合国维持和平部队军官希金斯中校和绑架真主党领导人奥贝德，旨在反对中东和黎巴嫩的和平进程，也为了给和平解决这个不结盟国家内非常复杂和令人担忧的局势增加困难，这是与国际法的原则以及我们人类文明的准则相对抗的行为。
