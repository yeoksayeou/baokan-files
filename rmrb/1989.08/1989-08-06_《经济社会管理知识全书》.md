    The "Comprehensive Book of Economic and Social Management Knowledge" is a large-scale reference book compiled by hundreds of experts and scholars according to academic disciplines.

It is a large-scale reference book with both theoretical and practical value.

    The book is organized by academic disciplines and compiled into four volumes. Its most prominent features are as follows: First, it is knowledge-based and scientific. This book, starting from the accurate summarization of knowledge, scientifically summarizes the achievements of human society in the fields of economics, society, and management, and accurately and concisely explains the knowledge of various disciplines to the readers. It emphasizes the socialist primary stage theory, the theory of socialist commodity economy with planning, the theory and practice of economic system reform, the theory and practice of modern scientific management, and the new achievements made by contemporary human society in production struggles and scientific experiments. Second, it is comprehensive and systematic. This is not only reflected in the extensive coverage of the knowledge entries included, the rich content, and the broad knowledge scope, but also in the systematic nature of the knowledge content of the disciplines introduced and the complete and rigorous internal logical structure. Third, the content is novel. The book does not merely adhere to outdated knowledge about economics and social management. Many of the disciplines included are new disciplines and new knowledge that have emerged in the fields of economics and science and technology in recent decades. The authors have made every effort to explain and revise these using the perspective and methods of Marxism. Fourth, it is strong in both theory and practicality.
