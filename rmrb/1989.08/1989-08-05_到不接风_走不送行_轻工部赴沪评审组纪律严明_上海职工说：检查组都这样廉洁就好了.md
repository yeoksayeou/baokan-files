Yesterday, the *Jiefang Daily* published a report praising the staff of the Light Industry Department who came to Shanghai to participate in the evaluation of national first-class enterprises. After the report was published, many workers in Shanghai commented that if officials from Beijing coming to the localities could all act this way, it would set a good example for anti-corruption efforts in various places and greatly reduce the burden of local reception work.

According to past practices, whenever higher-level inspection teams came to factories, the enterprises would elevate the reception standards, not only providing high-standard meals but also high-end gifts. However, this time, as soon as the evaluation team arrived in Shanghai, they clearly announced the discipline: no accepting banquets, no accepting gifts, no welcoming receptions upon arrival, and no farewell banquets upon departure; during meetings, no fruits, cigarettes, or drinks should be placed on the table; during meals, no alcohol, two dishes and one soup, and separate meals; no purchasing of products, including promotional products. They said what they did, strictly disciplined themselves, and left a good impression on the enterprises.

The last enterprise the evaluation team inspected was the Shanghai Watch Factory. The person in charge of reception was a bit uneasy and inquired with the other four factories, only to find out that the team indeed kept their word. When the work at the Shanghai Watch Factory was completed, according to the usual practice, each member of the inspection team could buy a new electronic watch at a discounted price, but no one bought any.

    到不接风　走不送行
    轻工部赴沪评审组纪律严明
    上海职工说：检查组都这样廉洁就好了
    本报上海8月5日电　昨天解放日报刊登一篇报道，表扬轻工部赴沪参加国家一级企业评审的工作人员。报道发表后，上海许多职工反映，从北京来地方的干部，如果都能这样做，将对各地的廉政建设起示范作用，也将大大减轻地方接待工作的压力。
    按过去惯例，凡上级派检查组来工厂，各企业招待无不提高规格，不但吃饭高标准，而且礼品必须高档次。但这次的评审组一到上海，就明确宣布纪律：不吃请，不受礼，来不要接风，去不要送行；开会，台面上不准放水果、香烟、饮料；吃饭，不上酒，两菜一汤分餐制；不买产品，包括广告产品。他们说到做到，严于律己，给企业留下良好印象。
    评审组评审的最后一家企业是上海手表厂。负责接待的同志心中有些不踏实，向其他4个厂打听消息，才知确实过得硬。在手表厂工作结束时，按例检查组每人可买一只优惠供应的新产品电子表，但谁也没有买。
