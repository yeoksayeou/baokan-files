The Arab world, composed of 22 Arab states, is a significant force on the international political stage. For a long time, due to various reasons, the Arab world has been fragmented, with intricate and often escalating conflicts, earning the region the reputation of being a "troubled area." Recently, with the easing of international tensions, a trend of reconciliation, unity, coordination, and cooperation has emerged among Arab states.

Egypt's return to the Arab League. Egypt is a major power in the Arab world. Whether in terms of strategic position, human resources, or military and political influence, it is a pivotal force on the Middle East political stage. Since 1979, Egypt's membership in the Arab League was suspended due to the signing of the Camp David Accords, the Arab world has undergone a painful period of division. After President Mubarak took office in 1981, he promptly adjusted Egypt's policy towards Arab states, making relations with Arab countries the cornerstone of Egypt's foreign policy. He adopted a policy of active engagement and restraint, patience, and waiting, achieving significant results. Over the years, Egypt has persistently worked to strengthen relations with Arab countries that have not severed ties, maintained multi-channel communication with Arab countries that have severed ties; supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people, promoted the advancement of the Middle East peace process; leveraged the developments in the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf situation to improve relations with Iraq and Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait; insisted on the Arab collective defense treaty, and engaged in military cooperation with some Arab countries; under the mediation of some Arab countries, gradually improved relations with deeply estranged Arab countries. Egypt's return to the Arab League marks a new stage in Arab unity, having a positive impact on the development of the situation in the Middle East.

Long-standing enmities among Arab states have been set aside, leading to reconciliation. At the end of May, the Arab Summit held in Casablanca saw Egyptian President Mubarak and Libyan leader Gaddafi shaking hands and greeting each other warmly. After the meeting, the two countries resumed air travel, and Gaddafi sent a special envoy to Egypt to discuss further improvement of bilateral relations. Mubarak and Syrian President Assad embraced and held talks, leading to further relaxation of relations between the two countries. Recently, Lebanon and Egypt resumed diplomatic ties. Assad and PLO Chairman Arafat, Gaddafi and Iraqi President Saddam, Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein also held meetings. This year, President Chadli visited Morocco, and King Hassan II approved the 1972 border treaty with Algeria, and the two countries signed an agreement to establish a joint venture for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Algeria through Morocco to Europe. The two countries also resumed passenger rail services that had been suspended for 13 years. The improvement of relations among these countries not only benefits the security and development of each country but also helps to further ease the regional situation.

The formation and development of three regional economic cooperation organizations. In 1981, the Gulf Cooperation Council, composed of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, has been advancing on the path of unity and strength. The six countries, based on economic and trade cooperation, have strengthened political consultations and coordination and are seeking to expand cooperation in military and security aspects. In February of this year, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Yemen formed the Arab Cooperation Council, and Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania formed the Arab Maghreb Union. Although these two organizations have been in existence for a short time, they have made rapid progress, and their organizational structures are already in place, with various works beginning to operate. The three Arab regional economic organizations include 15 of the 22 member states of the Arab League. These organizations not only complement each other economically but also coordinate their political positions and seek cooperation in military and security aspects. Their development trends will have a significant impact on the future changes in the power structure of the Arab world.

Relying on their own efforts to solve major problems facing the region is a positive change in Arab state relations. On one hand, Arab states cooperate with each other, continuously purify the Arab atmosphere, help some brotherly countries with long-standing grudges to eliminate differences, and achieve Arab reconciliation and unity. On the other hand, they propose using Arab wisdom and strength to solve major problems facing the Arab world. It is heartening to see that Arab states are playing an increasingly important role in resolving regional conflicts and easing the situation in the Middle East, and the ability of major powers to manipulate the development of Middle East affairs has significantly weakened.

The major changes in Arab state relations are in line with the wishes and interests of Arab states and peoples and will have a positive impact on the development and changes in the Middle East situation. People look forward to Arab states further strengthening their unity and playing a greater role in Middle East and international affairs. However, due to the long-standing and highly complex problems in the Arab world, Arab states need to make greater efforts to speak with one voice.

    阿拉伯国家关系的重大变化
    时延春
    由22个阿拉伯国家组成的阿拉伯世界，是国际政治舞台上一支重要力量。长期以来，由于种种原因，阿拉伯世界四分五裂，各种矛盾错综复杂，不时激化，被称之为“多事之秋”地区。最近一个时期，随着国际形势的缓和，阿拉伯国家之间吹荡起一股和解、团结、协调和合作之风。
    埃及重返阿拉伯国家联盟。埃及是阿拉伯世界中的一个大国，无论从战略地位、人力资源还是军事政治影响来说，它都是中东政治舞台上一支举足轻重的力量。自1979年埃及的阿盟成员国资格由于签署戴维营协议被中止以来，阿拉伯世界经历了一个分裂的痛苦过程。1981年穆巴拉克总统执政后，及时调整了对阿拉伯国家的政策，把埃及与阿拉伯国家关系作为其对外关系的基石，对其他阿拉伯国家采取积极主动做工作和克制忍让、耐心等待相结合的方针，取得显著成效。多年来，埃及一直以锲而不舍的精神，与未断交的阿拉伯国家巩固关系，同已断交的阿拉伯国家保持多渠道联系；支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，推动中东和平进程向前发展；利用两伊战争和海湾形势的发展，与伊拉克及沙特阿拉伯、科威特等海湾国家改善关系；坚持阿拉伯集体防务条约，与一些阿拉伯国家开展军工合作；在一些阿拉伯国家斡旋下，与积怨甚深的阿拉伯国家逐步改善关系。埃及重返阿盟，标志着阿拉伯团结发展到一个新阶段，对中东地区形势发展产生了积极的影响。
    长期交恶的阿拉伯国家捐弃前嫌实现和解。今年5月底在卡萨布兰卡召开的阿拉伯特别首脑会议，埃及总统穆巴拉克与利比亚领导人卡扎菲握手言欢，会后两国恢复通航，卡扎菲派特使访问埃及，就进一步改善两国关系交换了意见。穆巴拉克总统与叙利亚总统阿萨德拥抱晤谈，会后两国关系进一步松动。不久前，黎巴嫩与埃及复交。阿萨德总统与巴勒斯坦国总统阿拉法特、卡扎菲与伊拉克总统萨达姆、阿拉法特与约旦国王侯赛因也都进行了会晤。今年以来，沙德利总统访问摩洛哥，哈桑二世国王宣布批准1972年与阿尔及利亚签订的边界条约，双方签署了关于成立负责铺设由阿尔及利亚经摩洛哥通向欧洲的天然气管道混合公司协定，两国还恢复中断已13年的铁路客运。这些国家之间关系的改善，不仅有利于各国的安全和发展，也有助于地区形势的进一步缓和。
    三个区域性经济合作组织的形成和发展。1981年，由沙特阿拉伯、科威特、阿联酋、阿曼、卡塔尔和巴林6国组成的海湾合作委员会，在联合自强的道路上不断前进。6国在经贸合作的基础上，加强政治磋商和协调，正谋求在军事、治安等方面扩展合作。今年2月，埃及、伊拉克、约旦和阿拉伯也门4国组成阿拉伯合作委员会，摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、利比亚和毛里塔尼亚5国组成阿拉伯马格里布联盟。这两个组织成立时间虽短，但进展较快，其组织机构已经健全，各项工作开始运转。3个阿拉伯区域性经济组织包括阿盟22个成员国中的15个。这些组织不仅在经济上互惠互补，而且在政治上协调立场，在军事、治安方面谋求合作，其发展动向将对今后阿拉伯世界力量格局的变化产生重大影响。
    依靠自己的努力解决本地区面临的重大问题，是阿拉伯国家关系中一个可喜的积极变化。一方面，阿拉伯国家相互配合，不断净化阿拉伯气氛，帮助一些存在宿怨的兄弟国家消除分歧，实现阿拉伯和解、团结。另一方面，它们提出用阿拉伯自己的智慧和力量，解决阿拉伯世界面临的重大问题。人们高兴地看到，阿拉伯国家在解决地区冲突、缓和中东地区形势方面的作用不断增大，大国操纵中东事态发展的能力明显减弱。
    阿拉伯国家关系中出现的这些重大变化符合阿拉伯国家和人民的愿望及利益，对中东形势的发展变化将起一定积极作用。人们期待着阿拉伯国家进一步加强团结，在中东和国际事务中发挥更大作用。但由于阿拉伯世界存在的问题由来已久，且具有高度复杂性，阿拉伯国家要用一个声音说话，还需做出更大努力。
