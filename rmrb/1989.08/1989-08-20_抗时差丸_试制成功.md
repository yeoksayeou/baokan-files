People who travel long distances by airplane often experience fatigue and insomnia upon arrival at their destination due to jet lag. Many people who frequently travel for work dream of a medicine that can help the body adapt to time differences.

Scientists from the United Kingdom, France, and Australia have successfully developed a "jet lag pill" after years of research. This pill contains the component melatonin. The production process of melatonin is as follows: the hypothalamus in the brain acts like a metronome, regulating the body's activity rhythm and controlling the cycle of sleep and wakefulness. As night falls, the hypothalamus stimulates the pineal gland in the brain, which can continuously produce melatonin for ten hours. Once melatonin is produced, the person gradually falls asleep.

Based on this principle, scientists have developed a pill containing 8 milligrams of melatonin. Passengers can take the pill when it is time to sleep, and by the time they reach their destination, their body's biological clock will be synchronized with the local time, eliminating the need to spend one or two days adjusting to the time difference. A biologist from Lyon, France, conducted an experiment where he gave this pill to twenty passengers flying from Paris to Washington. As a result, seventeen of them did not experience jet lag.

The "jet lag pill" works differently from sleeping pills. It merely induces sleep rather than acting as a sedative, and it has no side effects. Scientists are confident about the market potential of this drug.

    “抗时差丸”试制成功
    乘飞机作长途旅行的人，在抵达目的地之后，往往有疲倦、失眠等时差反应。许多因公常年出差的人，梦想能有一种药品，使人体适应时差。
    英国、法国、澳大利亚的科学家经过数年研究，已试制成一种“抗时差丸”。这是一种含有乙酰甲氧色胺成分的药物。乙酰甲氧色胺的产生过程是：大脑中的下丘脑腺，犹如一个节拍器，调整着人的活动节律，掌握着睡与醒的循环过程。夜晚降临时，下丘脑腺就促使大脑分泌松果体腺，松果体腺能持续十个小时产生乙酰甲氧色胺，它产生后，人就慢慢入睡了。
    依据这个原理，科学家试制了八毫克的含乙酰甲氧色胺的药丸。乘客在该睡眠的时候服下药丸，抵达目的地时，体内的生物钟已和当地时间同步，不再需要花一、两天的时间去调整时差。法国里昂一位生物科学家作过一项试验，他给二十名由巴黎飞往华盛顿的乘客服用了这种药，结果十七人未出现时差反应。
      “抗时差丸”和安眠药的作用完全不同，它只是催人入睡，而不是麻醉剂，没有副作用。科学家们对这种药物投入市场充满信心。
