Cao Lianbao has been the manager of the Shenyang Air Force Japanese Car Repair Center for 6 years, distributing 20,000 business cards, which he calls live advertisements.

A small business card, with Cao Lianbao's name and title printed on the front, and a brief overview of the repair center on the back. With a business card in hand, people can get a general idea of the repair center's services and technical conditions.

In 1984, Cao Lianbao was tasked with establishing the car repair center. How to increase the enterprise's reputation? Some newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations came to the door seeking advertisements. Logically, spending some money on advertising is worthwhile, but Cao Lianbao had other thoughts: the enterprise is newly established, with a thin capital base, and cannot be extravagant. Moreover, advertisements are too prevalent now, and readers and viewers are resentful, so spending money may not achieve good results. He then thought of business cards.

After serving customers, Cao Lianbao always hands out a business card. In Fushun, a private taxi had been broken down for nearly two years, and after visiting several repair shops, it was not fixed. Cao Lianbao took on this car, carefully inspected and repaired it, and quickly fixed the broken car. The driver was very moved and wanted to pay more, but Cao Lianbao said, "If you think our technology is good, go back and promote us a bit." He casually handed over his business card. In less than half a month, 18 broken cars from the Fushun area came to request repairs.

Cao Manager distributes business cards, and the center's business personnel also give out business cards to customers when they go out. In 6 years, the entire center has printed 60,000 business cards, costing 4,000 yuan, which is much cheaper than advertising in newspapers, TV stations, etc.

One business card after another has expanded the enterprise's reputation, and excellent service has won the trust of customers. In the past 6 years, the Shenyang Air Force Japanese Imported Car Repair Center has grown from 68 people to several hundred, with an average annual tax revenue of 150,000 yuan per person, ranking at the forefront.

    曹经理的名片
    穆军涛　徐文深
    曹连宝当沈阳空军日本汽车维修中心经理6年，发出2万张名片，他管这叫活广告。
    小小的名片，正面印着曹连宝的名字、职务，背面印的是修理中心的概况。一张名片在手，人们就对修理中心的服务内容技术条件知道个大概。
    1984年，曹连宝受命组建了汽车修理中心。如何提高企业的知名度？有的报刊、电台、电视台找上门来征求广告。按理说适当花钱做一些广告也是值得的，可曹连宝心里的“小九九”是：企业刚办，家底薄，不能大手大脚。而且，现在广告太滥，读者、观众心里反感，花钱不一定达到好效果。他就想起名片来了。
    为用户服务之后，曹连宝总是递上名片。抚顺有一私人出租车坏了近两年，跑了好几家修理厂没有修好，曹连宝接下了这车，认真检修，很快把病车修好了，司机很感动，要多交钱，曹连宝说：“你要认为我们技术还行，回去替我们宣传一下就可以了。”他顺手掏出自己的名片。不到半月，抚顺地区来了18台坏车要求修理。
    曹经理送名片，中心的业务员们外出也向用户赠名片。6年算起来，全中心印了6万张名片，成本4000元，比起到报刊、电视台等地作广告省钱多了。
    一张张名片扩大了企业的知名度，良好的服务更赢得了用户的信赖。6年来，沈空日本进口汽车维修中心从68人发展到几百人，每年人均创利税1．5万元，名列前茅。
