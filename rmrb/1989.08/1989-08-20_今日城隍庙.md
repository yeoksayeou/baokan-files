“North there is Nanjing Road, south there is the City God Temple,” ten out of every ten tourists visiting Shanghai will visit these two commercial streets. If Nanjing Road is Shanghai’s “window to industrial goods,” then the Yu Garden Market in the City God Temple can be called the “kingdom of small commodities.”

The 60-plus shops in the Yu Garden Market have established connections with more than 2,000 regions and factories in 22 provinces and municipalities across the country. The more than 20,000 types of small commodities they operate daily are mostly from other places. The Shanghai Button Shop, unique in its kind, sells nearly 80 varieties of bamboo, wood, metal, and plastic buttons, but only one or two types are produced in Shanghai. Items that attract tourists, such as Yixing purple clay, Dalian utensils, Qingdao wigs, Anji fishing rods, Sichuan walking sticks, Hangzhou scissors, Fujian lacquerware, Changtu flower vases, and so on, all come from various provinces and municipalities. Last year, during the Lunar New Year of the Dragon, the market gathered more than 10 million yuan worth of small commodities from all over the country. Just the series of dragon-themed small commodities had nearly 100 varieties, attracting “thousands of merchants and tens of thousands of customers.” The market organizes its supply through various horizontal relationships such as joint ventures, establishing production bases, outsourcing processing, and special agency sales of famous brand products from other places. More than half of the small commodities are then distributed from here to various places, becoming a distribution center for small commodities that connects various places and radiates throughout the country.

As Shanghai’s door to the outside world opens wider, the small commodities in the Yu Garden Market are increasingly favored by foreign tourists. Those traditional small commodities, which are abundant and varied, are praised by them as “genuine Chinese goods” and are highly popular. The Yu Garden Market Joint Stock Company, established half a year ago, has already established trade relations with more than 20 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Redwood furniture, buttons, knives and scissors, kites, lanterns, purple clay tea sets, porcelain, lacquerware, walking sticks, antiques, and even incense and tin foil from all over the country are shipped overseas and enter thousands of households. A Japanese businessman wanted to order a batch of small bamboo lamp shades for lanterns, but couldn’t find them anywhere. He specially requested the Yu Garden Market to solve the problem. The market immediately arranged for a specialty craft production base in Zhejiang to produce the items, making the businessman very pleased. As Yu Garden’s characteristic small commodities spread throughout the country, they are quickly making their way around the world.

    “北有南京路，南有城隍庙”，来到上海的游客，十之八九要光临这两处商业街。如果说，南京路是上海“工业品的橱窗”，那么城隍庙的豫园商场则堪称“小商品的王国”。
    城隍庙豫园商场的60余家商店，同全国22个省市的2000多个地区、工厂建立了联系，每天经营的2万余种小商品，绝大部分来自外地。独此一家的上海钮扣店经营的各种竹、木、金属、塑料钮扣近80个品种中，仅有一二种是上海产品。引起游客兴趣的宜兴紫砂、大连料器、青岛假发、安吉渔杆、四川手杖、杭州剪刀、福建漆器、昌图花瓶等等，无不来自兄弟省市。去年龙年新春，商场一下子就从全国各地调集了1000余万元的小商品，光“龙”的系列小商品就有近百种，引得“三千商贩云集，五万顾客流连”。商场通过联营、建立生产基地、外发加工和特约经销外地名牌产品等多种横向关系形式组织货源，而一半以上小商品又从这里源源流向各地，成为沟通各地、辐射全国的小商品集散地。
    随着上海对外开放的大门进一步拓开，豫园商场的小商品已日益为外国游客所喜爱。那些琳琅满目的传统小商品，被他们称之为“真正的中国货”而大受青睐。联合成立半年多的豫园商场股份有限公司，已经和美国、日本、澳大利亚、加拿大、荷兰、泰国、香港等20多个国家和地区的客商建立了贸易往来。来自祖国各地的红木家具、钮子、刀剪、风筝、宫灯、紫砂茶具、瓷器漆器、手杖、古玩，甚至香烛、锡箔都远涉重洋，进入千家万户，一位日本客商要定制一批神灯上用的竹制小灯罩，踏破铁鞋无觅处，特意要求豫园商场解决，商场马上安排浙江的特色工艺生产基地拿出了产品，使这位客商欣喜不已。豫园的特色小商品在走遍全国的同时，正在迅速走向世界。
