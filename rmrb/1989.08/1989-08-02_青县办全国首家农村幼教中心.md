In Qing County, Hebei Province, the first rural early childhood education research center in China has been established. With the support and assistance of the National Education Commission's Early Childhood Education Research Institute and the international professional charity organization, the Bernard van Leer Foundation from the Netherlands, the center's work is progressing smoothly.

The center, with an investment of 1.4 million yuan, is responsible for training rural kindergarten teachers, compiling national kindergarten teacher training materials and educational guidelines, researching the management system for township kindergarten teachers, and serving as a national rural early childhood education experimental base. Since its completion last year, the center has adopted a combination of classroom teaching, extracurricular tutoring, and on-site visits. Nearly 150 rural kindergarten teachers from seven counties and districts in the province have received standardized international kindergarten teacher training.
