Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, August 18th.

The United Nations Secretary-General today issued a statement urging the leaders of Iran and Iraq to continue their efforts to fully implement Security Council Resolution 598.

The statement was issued on the occasion of the first anniversary of the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq. It pointed out that only by fully implementing Resolution 598 can the Iran-Iraq conflict be comprehensively resolved, and can neighborly relations between Iran and Iraq as well as peace and stability in the region be achieved. He also said that peace achieved without distinguishing between victors and vanquished will be more enduring.

De Cuellar said that since the ceasefire was implemented on August 20 last year, countless lives have been saved, and tensions have eased, which is a significant achievement. However, he said, it is unreasonable to be satisfied with this, because the region has not yet recovered security and stability. The armed forces of Iran and Iraq have not yet withdrawn to internationally recognized borders, and tens of thousands of prisoners of war have not yet been repatriated. He expressed his "deep regret" about this and pointed out that these are matters that Resolution 598 requires to be urgently implemented.

    联合国秘书长发表声明
    呼吁两伊全面执行598号决议
    本报联合国8月18日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天发表声明，呼吁伊朗和伊拉克领导人继续努力，完成执行安理会598号决议的任务。
    这项声明是德奎利亚尔在两伊停火一周年之际发表的。声明指出，只有完全执行598号决议才是全面解决两伊冲突的出路，才可带来两伊的睦邻关系以及该地区的和平与稳定。他还说，以不分胜者、败者的原则来解决两伊冲突，获得的和平才可持久。
    德奎利亚尔说，两伊自去年8月20日实施停火以来，无数生命免遭伤亡，紧张关系已经缓和，这是一项不小的成就。但是无理由以此满足，因为该地区尚未恢复安全和稳定。两伊军队尚未撤到国际公认的边界内，几万名两伊战俘尚未遣返，他对此“深表遗憾”，并指出，这是598号决议要求紧急执行的事。
