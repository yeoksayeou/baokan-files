According to reports, the Soviet Union destroyed a military reconnaissance satellite that had malfunctioned but was still in orbit in late July. This action was taken to prevent the satellite from falling into densely populated areas or into the hands of U.S. intelligence agencies. The magazine cited information from the U.S. Space Command, stating that U.S. military radar detected that the malfunctioning Soviet satellite, Cosmos 2030, was intentionally blown into over 50 pieces on July 28. These fragments are unlikely to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.

    苏摧毁太空失灵卫星
    据报道，苏联在7月底摧毁了一颗已失灵但仍处于太空轨道上的军事侦察卫星，以防该卫星落入人口稠密地区或美国情报部门手中。该杂志引用美军空间司令部的消息说，美军雷达发现苏联已失灵的宇宙2030卫星在7月28日被有意炸成50多片碎块。这些碎块不大可能重新进入大气层。
