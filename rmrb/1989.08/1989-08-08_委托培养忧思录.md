Sponsored education, as the name suggests, refers to the practice where employing units pay for students to be educated by universities, with graduates returning to work at the sponsoring unit. In a situation where state-funded educational resources are limited and some units urgently need talent, this is a good way to alleviate the shortage. This product of the combination of commodity economy and educational system reform has, after several years of nurturing and growth, become one of the "three brothers" in the new enrollment system of Chinese universities, alongside state-planned enrollment and self-funded enrollment.

However, just as certain species in the biological world undergo mutations from generation to generation, sponsored education has also undergone mutations contrary to its original intent in the past two years. The reporter's recent investigation into the situation of sponsored education in Anhui Province reveals some of these issues.

Sponsored education has become a form of employee welfare

In some economically robust factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions, having the company pay for education is seen as a welfare measure by employees, who therefore hope to solve their children's enrollment problems through sponsored education. To stabilize employee morale, these units have to pay a significant sum each year. A large enterprise in Anhui, for example, had basically solved the problem of certain talent shortages through sponsored education in the previous two years and could have reduced or even stopped sponsored education. However, during last year's college entrance examinations, many employees' children in this enterprise failed to meet the national planned enrollment score line and went to the enterprise leaders to request sponsored education for their children (the enrollment score line for sponsored education students can be reduced by a certain number of points compared to national planned enrollment). This resulted in the enterprise leaders' homes being besieged day and night. The enterprise had no choice but to negotiate with the enrollment department to increase the number of sponsored education students and the associated fees by more than double, only then satisfying some of the employees' demands.

There are also some sponsored education students who aim to become "non-agricultural" residents and secure a permanent cadre position.

Sponsoring units end up with empty hands

According to the principles of sponsored education, students should return to work at the sponsoring unit upon graduation. However, many sponsored education students, once they obtain their diplomas, immediately "jump ship" to find their ideal units.

Last year, a county in Anhui graduated over 40 sponsored education students from normal universities, who were supposed to teach at district and township schools. However, most of them had no intention of staying in the grassroots level and instead set their sights on party and government agencies. Many of them left their positions in the schools after just a few months and began "jumping ship," using various connections to transfer upwards. As a result, more than half of them left the schools and were transferred to county and district party and government agencies, as well as public security and judicial departments.

The mutations in sponsored education have brought about some negative effects, which are increasingly causing concern.

"Inbreeding" and "hereditary" employment. Some units, by using sponsored education as a key way to solve the enrollment problems of their own employees' children, refuse to sponsor the children of non-employees, which will inevitably lead to a "hereditary" system of employment. This is obviously not conducive to the rational combination and flow of talent. Some large sponsoring units in Anhui have already seen an excess of their own sponsored education students, while external talent with potential is unable to enter.

Unfair practices sneak in. Sponsored education enrollment is conducted within a reduced score range. However, some unit leaders, either through their authority or connections, send their children, who have lower scores than other examinees, to sponsored education. Their actions often use the legal form of "not exceeding the reduced score range," further adding to the hypocrisy of unfair practices. Some unit leaders, for their own children's sponsored education, do not hesitate to use public funds, while for other employees' children, they let them pay personally, favoring some and neglecting others, which is bound to cause resentment.

Fake sponsorship, true self-funding

Taking on debt to study, facing difficulties. Many sponsored education students do not have the fortune of being children of large factory and enterprise employees. They either have the government pay the majority and themselves pay a small portion, or themselves pay the majority and the government pay a small portion. As for students from impoverished regions accepting sponsored education, they have no connection to public funding and completely pay out of their own pockets. The reporter investigated four universities in Hefei, and these four universities enrolled a total of 1050 sponsored education students last year, of which more than 80% had their tuition fully paid by themselves, with some schools even exceeding 90%.

Self-funded sponsored education students face a terrifying expense: humanities majors pay 1750 yuan per academic year, science majors pay 2200 yuan per academic year, plus miscellaneous fees and personal living expenses, a two-year specialized sponsored education student needs to pay 5000-7000 yuan, and a three-year specialized sponsored education student needs to pay 7000-9000 yuan. Such a sum is a significant burden for some ordinary families; students from impoverished regions are even more overwhelmed. According to the reporter's investigation at a university, at least half of the sponsored education students in this school are studying through loans and borrowing. To the point where some students openly complain: "With money, you can go to college; without money, you're out of luck. 'Recruiting sponsored education students makes you a millionaire.'"

A middle school teacher who is a parent of a sponsored education student also complained to the reporter: "My monthly salary is 130 yuan, even if I save 30 yuan every month by living frugally, it would still take 16 or 17 years of savings to support a specialized sponsored education student, how can one bear it!"

Similarly, self-funded students feel even more aggrieved. Although both self-funded sponsored education students and pure self-funded students pay for their own education, the former can have a guaranteed job placement and become "non-agricultural" residents, while the latter have "nothing." Some self-funded students vent their frustrations: "Why is society so unfair to us?"

Loss of motivation to study. Because the future of sponsored education students is already determined and their job placement is guaranteed, many of them become lazy and indifferent, with the motto "60 is the magic number." Some even lack self-respect, self-discipline, and self-control, with disciplinary issues occurring frequently. The reporter saw from a university's academic affairs office's "Daily Behavior Assessment Form" that out of the school's over 300 sponsored education students, 12 were given warnings, demerits, probation, or expelled last year for cheating on exams, fighting, and causing disturbances.

Where is sponsored education heading?

There are various opinions on this issue, with no consensus.

Some people believe that with the implementation of the dual-choice system for college graduates, it is possible to provide a talent market for employing units, allowing them to directly select and "purchase" the talent they need from the market, without having to rely on sponsored education to cultivate talent. Therefore, sponsored education can be canceled in the future.

Others believe that sponsored education should still be continued, but the preferential policy of reduced score enrollment is a significant drawback, affecting the reputation of the college entrance examination and the quality of university students, while also providing convenience for social unfair practices and corruption. Therefore, in the future, the number of sponsored education enrollments should be strictly controlled, and sponsored education enrollment should be implemented with the same standards as national planned enrollment, with no score reduction for examinees.

Still, others believe that current sponsored education has actually become fake sponsorship and true self-funding, so it might as well be made public and uniformly implemented as self-funding without job placement, allowing students to compete on an open and fair basis.

Some education experts, after deep reflection, believe that sponsored education is a product of the transition from a socialist planned economy to a socialist market economy. It follows the principle of "who pays, who benefits" in the commodity economy, encouraging collective and individual investment in education. This not only taps into the potential of universities, increases educational investment, but also cultivates more talent for the country and should be affirmed in general. As for the mutations in sponsored education, these are influenced by various factors such as social unfair practices and the "anti-study" trend and can only be improved through strengthened management, promotion of clean governance, and deepening of reforms.

    委托培养忧思录
    新华社记者  蒋志敏
    委托培养，顾名思义，即由用人单位出钱，委托高校培养，毕业后到委托单位工作。在国拨教育经费有限而一些单位又急需人才的情况下，这是一条汲水解渴的好办法。这个商品经济与教育体制改革相结合的产儿，经过几年的抚育、成长，现已和国家计划招生、自费招生一起，成为我国高校招生新体制下的“三兄弟”。
    但是，正如生物界某些同种生物世代之间会发生变异一样，近两年来的委托培养也发生了与初衷相悖的变异。记者日前对安徽省委托培养情况的调查，足可窥见一斑。
      委托培养成了职工福利
    在一些经济实力比较雄厚的厂矿企事业单位，由公家出钱上学被职工视为一种福利措施，因此都希望通过委托培养来解决自己子女的入学问题。为稳定职工的情绪，这些单位不得不每年为此付出一笔巨款。安徽一家大型企业，前两年通过委托培养已基本解决了某些短缺人才的需要，本可以不搞或少搞委托培养。可是，在去年的高考中，这个企业有不少职工的子女因考分达不到国家计划招生的分数线，便纷纷去找企业领导，要求为其子女安排委托培养（委托培养生的录取分数线可比国家计划招生降低若干分），以致弄得企业负责人家一时门庭若市，昼夜不得安宁。企业无奈，只好与招生部门协商，将原来的委托培养计划中的人数、费用增加一倍多，才算满足了部分职工的要求。
    也有一些委托培养生是为了“农转非”，谋一个“永久牌”的干部身份。
            委托单位竹篮打水
    按照委托培养的原则，学生毕业后应回委托单位工作。然而，一些委托培养生一旦拿到文凭，便纷纷“跳槽”，寻找理想单位。
    安徽某县去年毕业了40多名师范院校的委托培养生，本应下到区、乡中学当教师。但是，他们多数无心留基层，两眼却盯着党政机关。不少人在基层栖身仅几个月就开始“跳槽”，通过各种关系一个劲地往上调。结果，有一半以上的人脱离了学校，调到了县、区党政机关和公安、司法部门。
    委托培养的变异带来的一些负效应，越来越使人感到忧虑。
    “近亲繁殖”，用人“世袭”。一些单位因为把委托培养作为解决本单位职工子女入学的重要途径，就拒绝委托培养非本单位的职工子女，今后必然导致用人的“世袭制”，这显然不利于人才的合理组合和流动。安徽一些委托培养大户单位，现在已经出现了本单位委托培养生过剩，而外来的有用人才又分不进去的怪现象。
    不正之风，乘机而入。委托培养招生是在降分的幅度内择优录取。但一些单位的领导干部或者凭借手中的职权，或者通过“关系户”，把自己的考分低于其他考生的子女送去委托培养。他们的做法，往往又是利用“不超过降分幅度”的合法形式来进行，更增添了不正之风的虚伪性。还有一些单位的领导，对自己的子女上委托培养不惜动用公款，而对其他职工子女上委托培养却让其个人出钱，厚此薄彼，怎不令人怨愤？
            假委托真自费
    负债上学，困难重重。很多委托培养生没有大型厂矿企业职工子女的那个福份。他们或者是公家拿大头、自己出小头，或者是自己拿大头、公家出小头。至于那些贫困地区的考生接受委托培养，更是与公费无缘，完全由个人掏腰包。记者调查了合肥地区的4所高校，这4所高校去年共招生1050名委托培养生，其中培养费完全由个人出的占80％以上，个别学校甚至超过90％。
    自费上委托培养的学生，面对的是一笔可怕的开支：文科每学年培养费1750元，理科每学年培养费2200元，加上学杂费和个人生活费，一个两年制专科委托培养生要支出5000—7000元，一个三年制专科委托培养生则要支出7000—9000元。这样一笔开支，对于一些普通家庭来说，不能不是一个很大的负担；那些来自贫困地区的学生更是不堪重负。据记者在一所大学了解，这个学校至少有一半以上的委托培养生是靠借债和贷款来上学的。以致有些学生公开抱怨：有钱上大学，没钱靠边站；“招收委托培养生，好了万元户。
    一位担任中学教师的委托培养生家长也向记者诉苦：“我一个月工资130元，就是省吃俭用每月积蓄30元，也需要十六、七年的积蓄才能供养起一个专科委托培养生，这如何承受得了！”
    同样自费，待遇悬殊。如果说自费的委托培养生叫苦不迭，那么，纯自费生更是感到委屈。因为二者虽然都是自己花钱上学，前者可以包分配、“农转非”，而后者则“一无所有”。一些自费生大发牢骚：“社会为什么对我们如此不公平？”
    学习松劲，缺乏动力。由于委托培养生出路已定，分配保险，不少人惰性抬头，懒懒散散，“60分万岁”成了座右铭。还有少数人更是缺乏自尊、自重、自律，违纪行为时常发生。记者从一所大学教务处的《学生日常行为考核表》上看到，在该校300多名委托培养生中，去年因考试作弊、打架闹事而受到警告、记过、留校察看和退学处理的就有12名。
        委托培养将被取代？
    委托培养向何处去？对此，众说纷纭，莫衷一是。
    有人认为，随着高校毕业生双向选择制度的推行，就有可能为用人单位提供一个人才市场，用人单位可以直接到人才市场上挑选、“购买”自己所需要的人才，不必再通过委托培养的办法来培养人才。因此，委托培养今后可以取消。
    也有人认为，委托培养还应当搞，但委托培养享受降分录取的优惠这一条弊病很大，影响了高考的声誉和高校生源质量，同时也为社会不正之风和腐败现象提供了方便之门。为此，今后的委托培养要严格控制招生人数，委托培养招生实行与国家计划招生同等标准，考生一律不降分。
    还有人认为，现在的委托培养实际已经变成了假委托、真自费，不如让其公开化，索性一律实行自费，不包分配，让学生在公开、公平的条件下实行竞争。
    一些教育专家深长思之，委托培养是社会主义产品经济向社会主义商品经济转轨时期的产物，它按照“谁出钱谁受益”的商品经济原则，鼓励集体和个人一起投资办学，这样既挖掘了高校的潜力，增加了教育投资，又为国家多培养了人才，应当在总体上给予肯定。至于委托培养的变异，这是受社会不正之风以及“厌学风”等多种因素交织影响而产生的，只能通过加强管理、推进廉政和深化改革来加以改进。
