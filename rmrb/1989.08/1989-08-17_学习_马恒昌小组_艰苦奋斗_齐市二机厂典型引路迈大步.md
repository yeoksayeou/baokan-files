The Second Machine Tool Factory in Qiqihar has persistently educated its employees to inherit and carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. The factory has produced batch after batch of "Ma Hengchang Groups," effectively promoting the deepening of enterprise reforms and significantly improving economic benefits.

The old members of the Ma Hengchang Group, during the War of Liberation, braved enemy bombings to continue production, earning numerous red banners for high quality and high productivity. After entering the socialist construction period, the group has had 16 different leaders and the members have changed several times, but the tradition of hard work has never been lost.

The factory, in response to some young workers' blind pursuit of high consumption, comparison, and lack of dedication to their jobs, timely organized an exhibition of the Ma Hengchang Group's achievements. They invited old members of the Ma Hengchang Group to share their stories and promoted the "Love Your Post, Compare Contributions" campaign across the factory to help everyone establish a correct view of hardship and happiness. Last year, the factory saw the emergence of 31 Ma Hengchang-style teams and 211 red-flag teams. The factory has over a thousand young employees who have excelled in production and operations each year, with nearly a hundred young workers completing more than two years' worth of work annually.

The factory leadership leads by example in frugality. Last year, the factory built a new office building, but the leaders allocated it to technical and business departments, continuing to work in the old, dilapidated building that has been in use for over 40 years. During overseas inspections, they saved every possible expense.

    学习“马恒昌小组”艰苦奋斗
    齐市二机厂典型引路迈大步
    本报讯　齐齐哈尔第二机床厂坚持不懈地教育职工继承和发扬艰苦奋斗精神，涌现出一批又一批“马恒昌小组”，有效地推进了企业改革的不断深化，经济效益大幅度提高。
    马恒昌小组老组员在解放战争时期冒着敌机狂轰滥炸的危险，坚持生产，获得一面面优质高产的红旗。进入社会主义建设时期以后，小组的组长换了16位，组员也换了十几茬，艰苦奋斗传统一直没有丢。
    这个厂针对一些青年工人盲目追求高消费、攀比、不安心本职工作的情况，及时举办马恒昌小组事迹展览会，请马恒昌小组老组长讲传统，在全厂广泛开展“爱岗位、比贡献”活动，帮助大家树立正确的苦乐观。全厂去年涌现31个马恒昌式班组、211个红旗班组。工厂每年有千余名青年职工在生产经营活动中立功，近百名青年工人每年完成两年以上工作量。
    厂领导带头节俭办事。去年工厂建起一座新的办公楼，厂领导把它分给技术和业务科室，厂领导仍然挤在40多年历史的简陋旧楼内办公。出国考察时，用费一省再省。
