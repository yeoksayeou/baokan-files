Outdated Training Facilities Hinder China's Athletics Potential

    NEW YORK, Aug. 11 (Xinhua) -- "China has a large number of athletes with tremendous potential, but outdated training facilities and poor-quality athletic shoes are hindering their efforts to reach the world's top levels."

    This is the consensus reached by several American track and field coaches who recently returned from a visit to China.

    The first group of American track and field coaches concluded nearly two weeks of lectures and training sessions in Beijing, Dalian, and Qingdao in mid-July. The organizers of the group, Glenda Moody, Neil Saloman, chairman of the International Cultural Foundation, and Ken Gibson, who led the U.S. team to the Seoul Olympics, said in an interview today that their visit to China was very fruitful. They saw the excellent qualities and great potential of Chinese track and field athletes, which gave them a good outlook for the future of Chinese track and field. They plan to organize more track and field coaches to visit China next year to contribute to the development of Chinese track and field.

    Moody, 43, told the reporter that she and the other five coaches who had just returned from China all agreed that, based on the qualities and potential of Chinese athletes, China could at least dominate the Asian track and field scene and possibly reach the top in some events. The former world high jump record holder Zhu Jianhua is a good example.

    However, she added, "Unfortunately, China's excellent track and field talents do not have access to advanced training facilities, and thus cannot fully develop their potential." She emphasized that China particularly needs several sets of modern universal weightlifting equipment and high-quality athletic shoes. Since most Chinese athletes wear poor-quality shoes and have insufficient upper body strength, they are very prone to injuries.

    Universal weightlifting equipment refers to a set of modern mechanical devices that allow many people to exercise different parts of their bodies simultaneously. It is reported that American track and field athletes can achieve world-class results mainly due to this equipment, while Chinese athletes use mostly barbells, which American coaches refer to as "primitive training methods." Currently, universal weightlifting equipment is widely used in Europe and America. Moody said that her International Crossers Company plans to donate several sets of universal weightlifting equipment and a batch of athletic shoes to China through social fundraising.

    Moody and Saloman also mentioned that during their stay in Beijing, they suggested to Chinese sports officials that they would like to fund a group of Chinese track and field coaches to study in the U.S., but these coaches must have good English listening and speaking skills. If it is difficult to find such coaches, they will consider sending more American coaches to China to teach. It is reported that this suggestion has been approved by Chinese sports officials.

    落后训练设施抑制中国田径的潜力
    新华社华盛顿8月11日电　（记者陆文岳）“中国拥有一大批潜力巨大的田径运动员，但是，中国的原始训练设施和运动鞋阻碍了他们向世界高峰冲击。”
    这是不久前访华归来的几位美国田径教练向记者表述的一致结论。
    首批美国田径教练团7月中旬在北京、大连和青岛进行了近半个月讲学教练活动。该团组织者格伦达·穆迪女士、国际文化基金会主席尼尔·萨洛农和率领美国队参加汉城奥运会的肯·吉布森教练，今天下午在接受记者专访时表示：这次访华收获甚大，中国田径运动员的优良素质和巨大潜力使他们看到了中国田径事业的良好前景。他们打算明年组织更多的田径教练访华，为促进中国田径事业贡献一份力量。
    43岁的穆迪告诉记者，她和其他5位刚从中国讲学归来的教练都认为，从中国运动员的素质和潜力来看，中国至少可称雄亚洲田坛，并可能在一些项目上登上世界田径高峰，曾经打破世界跳高纪录的朱建华便是一例。
    然而她接着说：“可惜，中国的优秀田径人才得不到先进的训练设施，因而无法充分发展自己的潜能。”她强调指出：中国尤其需要若干套现代化的万能举重设施和优质运动鞋。由于中国大多数运动员穿的是劣质运动鞋，再加上上身力量不足，所以很容易受伤。
    所谓万能举重设施，是一套可供许多人同时锻炼身体各个部位的现代化机械装置。据介绍，美国田径运动员之所以能取得国际一流成绩，除了身体素质外，主要得益于这种设备，而中国运动员锻炼肌肉力量所用的大都是杠铃，也即是美国教练们所称的“原始训练手段”。目前万能举重设施在欧美已经普及。穆迪女士说，她的国际跨越者公司拟通过社会募捐方式向中国赠送若干套万能举重设施和一批运动鞋。
    穆迪女士和萨洛农先生还谈到，他们在北京期间曾向中国体委官员建议，他们愿意出资邀请一批中国田径教练来美进修，但这些教练必须具备良好的英语听说能力。如果难以找到这样的教练，他们将考虑派更多的美国教练赴华执教。据说这项建议已获中国体委官员的赞许。
