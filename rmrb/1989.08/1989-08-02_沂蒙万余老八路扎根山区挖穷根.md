Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 2nd.

Over 10,000 old Eighth Route Army veterans in the Yimeng Mountain region of Shandong Province are working tirelessly to change the face of poverty in their hometowns and create new achievements.

The Yimeng Mountain region, with its glorious revolutionary traditions, saw tens of thousands of people join the army during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. After the liberation of the nation, most of them returned to farming. Today, more than 14,000 of these veterans still live in the countryside. In the effort to eradicate poverty in the mountainous region, these old Eighth Route Army veterans are drawing on the spirit of their wartime struggles and leading the charge against poverty. Among them, 2,300 have taken on the responsibility of managing mountains, orchards, and sideline production projects. Additionally, 800 have initiated over 700 economic cooperatives.

In Feixian County's Mato Cliff Village, 12 old Eighth Route Army veterans formed the "Old Qu Yuan Mountain Treatment Team." They took on the task of cultivating over 1,000 acres of barren mountains, planting trees, and generating over 60,000 yuan in annual income for the collective.

Nearly 70-year-old Wang Baokai, an old Eighth Route Army veteran from Linxi County, enlisted in 1944 and participated in over 100 battles, sustaining four injuries and receiving seven meritorious citations. For decades since his return to the countryside, he has quietly contributed to his hometown. To improve the local drought conditions, he, despite his injured body, worked alongside the locals to dig canals and manage water resources. Even when he fell ill, he refused to leave the worksite. Known as the "Living Li Xiangyang" in Rizhao City, old Eighth Route Army veteran Wei Zhendong was once a feared guerrilla leader. He never asked the organization for favors and, for decades since his return to the countryside, has worked in the fields alongside his fellow villagers. After the implementation of the household responsibility system, he took the initiative to manage the village's over 100 acres of fish ponds, continuing to toil for his fellow villagers through wind and rain.

    沂蒙万余老八路扎根山区挖穷根
    新华社济南电　（通讯员程鹏、记者王志耘）山东省沂蒙山区万余名老八路为改变家乡贫困面貌艰苦奋斗，创造新的业绩。
    具有光荣革命传统的沂蒙山区在抗日战争时期曾有几十万人参军。全国解放后，他们大都解甲归田。至今仍有1.4万余名在乡务农。在山区脱贫致富中，老八路发扬战争年代那么一股劲，率先向贫困宣战。他们中已有2300多人承包了山林、果园和工副业项目，有800多人牵头办起了700多个经济联合体。费县马头崖村12名老八路组成“老愚公治山队”，承包荒山开荒植树1000余亩，每年为集体创收6万余元。年近古稀的临沭县老八路王保科，1944年参军，参加过上百次战斗，曾4次负伤，7次荣立战功。回乡几十年来，他一直默默无闻地为家乡人民作奉献。为改变当地干旱状况，他拖着受伤的身体和群众一起开渠治水，累病了也不离开工地。被群众称为“活李向阳”的日照市老八路魏振东，当年是威震敌胆的武工队长。他从不向组织伸手，回乡几十年一直跟大伙一样下田劳动。实行生产责任制后，他又主动负责村里的上百亩鱼塘，风里雨里继续为乡亲们操劳。
