In the discussion on agricultural development problems, how to break through the stagnation?

We in Zibo City, Shandong Province, have only 0.7 mu of arable land per capita, which is half the national average. Under these circumstances, we have gradually established a new investment mechanism that integrates science and technology, policy, and investment. This has improved agricultural labor productivity and land output, accelerating the transformation from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture.

The development of agriculture is essentially a process of continuous transformation of agricultural inputs. Currently, the development of China's agricultural economy, especially in crop cultivation and animal husbandry, is basically a low-level cycle. Due to the lack of integration between material inputs and advanced and applicable scientific and technological advancements, the input-output ratio is very low. This inevitably forms a vicious cycle: on the one hand, the low efficiency of agricultural inputs requires continuous increases in inputs to maintain and increase output; on the other hand, due to the low efficiency of inputs, high agricultural costs affect the enthusiasm of farmers, collectives, and local governments to invest in agriculture. Zibo City has established a mechanism that integrates science and technology, policy, and investment, breaking out of this vicious cycle. Last year, despite a decrease in grain production across the province, Zibo City achieved a bumper harvest, with both yield and total production reaching historical highs. Compared to 1978, the grain field area decreased by 440,000 mu, but the total production increased by approximately 200 million kilograms. The production of fruits and vegetables increased by 14 times, the total fruit production increased by 1.4 times, and the total egg production increased by 5 times. The commercialization rate of agricultural and sideline products in the city reached 63.8%.

When establishing the new integrated investment mechanism, we focused on the following three points:

First, directing production factor inputs towards technological progress projects. In the past, when emphasizing the strengthening of agricultural inputs, we often overlooked the integration with science and technology, focusing only on increasing the input of funds, materials, and labor, resulting in low input efficiency. When formulating agricultural policies, we often neglected science and technology, making policies ineffective in promoting the penetration of science and technology into agriculture. When emphasizing agricultural science and technology, we often lacked policy support and necessary funds and materials, making farmers lack the initiative and conditions to apply advanced agricultural technologies. We have worked to change this fragmented situation, paying attention to integrating the three aspects, using science and technology as the guide, policies as the driving force, and material inputs as the guarantee, to promote and guide various production factors to flow towards technological progress projects, making agricultural development truly based on technological progress. The integrated investment mechanism not only mobilizes farmers' enthusiasm for using advanced technologies but also improves the efficiency of agricultural inputs. For example, the implementation of the "Harvest Plan" in agriculture has an input-output ratio of 1:8, which is much higher than the input-output ratio of simple agricultural material inputs and also higher than the current industrial project input-output ratio of 1:2.5.

Second, organizing agricultural technology promotion according to the laws of the commodity economy. Promoting agricultural technological progress is key to getting scientific and technological personnel into the main battlefield of rural economy. However, currently, agricultural technology promotion lacks motivation and vitality, resulting in a large number of mature and applicable technologies not being promoted and applied. Therefore, we combine rural economic system reform with scientific and technological system reform, introducing the mechanism of the commodity economy into agricultural technology promotion work. The city formulates policies to encourage scientific and technological personnel to provide paid agricultural technology services and technical contracting, linking the personal interests of scientific and technological personnel with those of farmers, using contracts to define the responsibilities, rights, and interests of both parties. This not only mobilizes the enthusiasm of scientific and technological personnel to promote technologies but also mobilizes farmers' enthusiasm to adopt technologies, accelerating the modernization of agriculture.

Third, placing the focus of investment on ensuring the long-term stable development of agriculture. Zibo City focuses its investments on "one construction and two developments," namely agricultural infrastructure construction and the development of plains and mountainous areas. Agricultural infrastructure is the material and technological foundation for agricultural development, fundamentally determining agricultural prosperity. In agricultural infrastructure construction, we have changed the previous practice of relying solely on labor and funds, paying attention to the combined use of science and technology, policies, and material inputs, making agricultural infrastructure transition from meeting the needs of traditional agriculture to meeting the needs of modern agriculture.

    建立三位一体投入新机制
    王怀远
    我们山东淄博市人均耕地只有0.7亩，相当于全国人均数的一半。在这种情况下，我们逐步建立科技、政策、投入三位一体新的投入机制，提高了农业劳动生产率和土地产出率，加速了传统农业向现代农业的转变。
    农业的发展过程，实质上是农业投入的不断转化过程。目前我国农业经济特别是种植业和养殖业的发展，基本上是在低层次上的循环。由于物质投入没有同先进适用的科学技术融为一体，投入效益十分低下，这就必然形成一个怪圈：一方面农业投入效益低，必须靠不断增大投入来维持和增加产出；另一方面由于投入效益低，农业成本高，影响了农民、集体和地方农业投入的积极性。淄博市由于建立了科技、政策、投入三位一体的投入机制，跳出了这一怪圈。去年，在全省粮食减产的情况下，全市粮食获得丰收，单产和总产均创历史最高水平，与1978年相比，粮田面积减少44万亩，总产却增加约2亿公斤，瓜菜产量增加14倍，果品总产增加1.4倍，禽蛋总产增加5倍，全市农副产品商品率达到63.8％。在建立三位一体新的投入机制时，我们注意抓好以下三点：
    一、把生产要素投入引向技术进步项目。过去，在强调加强农业投入时，往往忽略了同科技相结合，只是单纯地增加资金、物资和劳力投入，造成了投入的低效益；在制定农业政策时，往往与科技脱节，使政策起不到促进科技向农业渗透的激励和引导作用；在强调农业科技时，又往往缺乏政策配套和必需的资金、物资保障，使农民缺乏应用先进农业技术的积极性和必要条件。我们努力改变这种分割状况，注意把三者结合起来，以科技为导向，以政策为动力，以物质投入为保证，推动和引导各种生产要素向技术进步项目流动，使农业发展真正建立在依靠科技进步的基础上。三位一体的投入机制，既调动了农民运用先进技术的积极性，又提高了农业投入效益，如农业“丰收计划”的实施，投入产出比为1∶8，不仅大大高于单纯农业物质投入产出比，而且也高于目前工业项目1∶2.5的投入产出比。
    二、按商品经济规律组织农业科技推广。推进农业科技进步，关键是使科技人员进入农村经济主战场。但现在农业技术推广缺乏动力和活力，致使大量早已成熟的适用技术不能推广应用。于是我们把农村经济体制改革和科技体制改革结合起来，把商品经济的机制引入农业科技推广工作。市里制定政策，鼓励科技人员实行农业技术有偿服务和技术承包，把科技人员的个人利益同农民的利益结为一体，以合同的形式规定双方的责、权、利，既调动科技人员推广技术的积极性，又调动农民采用技术的积极性，加速了农业的现代化步伐。
    三、把投入的基点放在保证农业长期稳定发展上。淄博把投入的重点放在“一个建设、两大开发”上，即农业基础设施建设和平原开发、山区开发。农业基础设施是农业发展的物质技术基础，它从根本上决定着农业的丰歉。在农业基础设施建设方面，我们改变过去单纯劳力、资金投入的作法，注意结合运用科技、政策和物质投入的力量，使农业基础设施由适应传统农业需要向适应现代化农业需要转变。
