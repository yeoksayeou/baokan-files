Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, August 5th.

Alphu Aqing Jiemei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with the leaders of the Lhasa martial law troops at his residence today. He said that the Lhasa martial law troops have modelly executed the Party's ethnic policies, observed discipline among the people, and excellently completed the task of quelling the disturbances, making contributions to the stability and unity of Tibet.

Alphu Aqing Jiemei said that he is not unfamiliar with this troop. As early as the 1950s, when the People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet and liberated the eastern region of Changdu, he had already known this troop and established a deep affection with it. He said that when he was in Beijing, he had heard the high praise from the people of Lhasa for the troops, praising the "Bodhisattva Soldiers" who liberated millions of serfs as having returned to the midst of the Tibetan people.

Alphu Aqing Jiemei emphasized that in the future, we must further strengthen military-civilian relations, unite as one, and jointly safeguard the peace and stability of Tibet and the integrity of the country's territory.

    阿沛·阿旺晋美会见拉萨戒严部队
    新华社拉萨8月5日电　（西藏人民广播电台记者蒋小锋、本社记者多吉）全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美今天在他的住地会见拉萨戒严部队领导时说，拉萨戒严部队模范执行党的民族政策，遵守群众纪律，出色完成平息骚乱任务，为西藏安定团结作出了贡献。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，对于这支部队，他并不陌生，早在50年代初，人民解放军进军西藏、解放西藏东部的昌都地区时，他就认识了这支部队，并与之建立了深厚的感情。他说，他在北京时就听到了拉萨人民对部队的高度评价，称赞当年解放百万农奴的“菩萨兵”又回到了西藏人民中间。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美强调，今后要进一步加强军民关系，团结一致，共同保卫好西藏的和平稳定，保卫好祖国领土的完整。
