Visiting the market in Xishuangbanna is a delightful experience.

One spring day, I went to the agricultural market in Menghan Town, Jinghong County. Along the banks of the Lancang River, amidst the octagonal towers, a once-empty area was now vibrant and colorful, unlike the typical markets in inland China with their gray, blue, and white tones. The vendors selling cloth had arranged their bright, eye-catching fabrics in overlapping layers, hanging them high like colorful screens under the blue sky. Groups of Dai girls wandered around, admiring, pointing, and chatting. They were beautifully dressed in short tops and tube skirts, with long hair tied back with hairpins, naturally falling over their shoulders. The hairpins were adorned with flowers—rarely artificial, mostly fresh ones like roses, jasmine, orchids, night-blooming jasmine, and eggplant flowers. The colors were vivid, and the fragrance was intoxicating. Many of the girls also applied a bit of makeup, with fair faces, red lips, and jet-black hair. Each held a colorful parasol and carried a small, embroidered bag, walking gracefully like butterflies fluttering in a garden of flowers. I firmly believe that the Dai people are the most beauty-loving members of our national family, and this market is the most colorful one.

In front of one of the "colorful screens," five girls were discussing something. The clever vendor quickly took down some fabric and draped it over one of the girls, saying, "This makes a great tube skirt, and this makes a lovely top. It's only 10 yuan per meter, very affordable." After discussing among themselves, the girls made the purchase. The vendor was of average height, thin, and had a typical Sichuanese appearance. Upon asking, I found out he was indeed from Sichuan. He told me his name was Zhang Yun Gao and that he was from the outskirts of Zigong. He explained that their land was scarce, with each person only able to contract 0.36 mu of land. His wife and one son worked the land, while he brought two children to do business here for three years. Every year, he bought over 100 varieties of silk and blended fabrics from Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces, with daily sales reaching several hundred yuan. He happily said, "The party's open policy is great. With limited land at home, we came out to do business, earning three to four thousand yuan a year. We also got to visit famous scenic spots and big cities, broadening our horizons and gaining knowledge, while also helping ethnic minorities get the things they want." He was right! A Dai girl named Yu Zhen had just bought a piece of purple silk with white flowers from his stall and happily told me, "Now we can buy whatever fabric we want, unlike before. Look, there are so many choices of colors." Indeed, on both sides of Zhang's stall, there were over 10 more stalls, each with a variety of fabric colors. I thought that it was because of people like Zhang Yun Gao who brought "beauty" to the Dai people, making them even more beautiful and charming.

If the fabric market is a feast for the eyes, the fresh produce and food market is a feast for the taste buds. To the left of the entrance, there were pineapples topped with "green flowers," yellow and green; to the right, there were piles of sugarcane, shining purple-red; further along the aisles, there were large and small piles, colorful and vibrant. There were golden bananas and plantains, greenish-yellow papayas, bright green watermelons, unassuming coconuts, orange-colored tangerines, yellow pineapples with eyes, and green-purple ones without. There were red tomatoes, apples, pears, and some dried and fresh fruits we couldn't name. There were seasonal vegetables in abundance, and the meat was fresh and cheap. As for the Dai specialties like roasted fish, roasted chicken, roasted rosuo, and pickled bamboo shoots, they were even more appetizing. We bought watermelons for 0.4 yuan per kilogram and tomatoes for 0.1 yuan per kilogram, eating as we exclaimed, "We're experiencing summer early this year!" Indeed, even if there were watermelons in the north at this time, they would be expensive, but here, the market was full of fruits. Our country's vast land is truly amazing!

    迷人的傣寨市场
    本报记者　萧俊熙
    在西双版纳赶摆——逛市场，是一种美的享受。
    今春的一天，我赶到景洪县勐罕镇的农贸市场。澜沧江边，八角楼群中一块原本空旷的场地，此刻被赶摆的人装扮得五彩缤纷，同内地以灰、蓝、白色为基调的市场景观大不一样。卖衣料的货主为招徕顾客，把鲜艳夺目的各色衣料鳞状排列后高高挂起，像一张张彩色屏幕挂在蓝天之下，三五成群的傣家姑娘徘徊其前，观赏，指点，议论。她们梳妆漂亮，身穿艳丽的短衫和筒裙，长长的头发用发卡在脑后拢成一束，自然地飘洒在肩上。发卡处饰一圈花儿，少有绢花，多为鲜花，有玫瑰、蔷薇、兰花、夜来香、鸡蛋花……色彩斑斓，幽香阵阵。许多姑娘还略施脂粉，粉白的面庞，鲜红的嘴唇，墨玉般的秀发，加上人人手擎一把彩色小伞，腰挎一只各色绣花小包，迈碎步，袅袅穿行，真真像百花园里翻飞着的群群彩蝶。我深信不疑，傣族是我们这民族大家庭里最爱美的一员，这里的市场是色彩最丰富的市场。
    在一张“彩屏”前，5个姑娘正边看边议，机灵的货主忙随她们的眼神取下衣料，往一个姑娘身上一搭说：“这个做筒裙，这个做上衣，多漂亮。10元一米，不贵。”姑娘们交换意见后，买卖成交了。货主中等个儿，瘦瘦的，典型的四川汉子形象，一问，正是。他告诉我，他叫张允高，自贡市郊人。他们那里人多地少，每人只承包得0.36亩地，妻和一个儿子种地，他带两个孩子来这里经商3年了。每年从广东、浙江、江苏等地买进傣族人民喜爱的各色丝绸、混纺衣料等100多个品种，每天营业额几百元。他非常高兴地说：“党的开放政策好。家里地少不够种，我们出来做生意，一年能挣三四千元，又游览了祖国的名胜、大城市，开眼界，长知识，还帮助少数民族买到了他们想买的东西。”他说得对！叫玉珍的傣族姑娘刚在他的货棚买了一块紫色撒白花的绸料，满意地对我说：“现在我们想买什么衣料都能买到，同过去不一样了。你看，这么多衣料，选什么颜色的都能选出。”确实，在老张货棚两旁，还有10多家一溜儿排开，什么颜色的衣料都有。我想，正是因为有张允高们传递“美”，使傣族人民更加美丽、动人。
    如果说布匹市场可大饱眼福的话，鲜货、食品市场则让人垂涎。进门左边儿有顶着“绿花”的菠萝，黄黄绿绿；右边小山似的甘蔗，紫红闪亮；再看通道两旁，大堆小摊，五颜六色，金黄的香蕉、芭蕉，绿中透黄的木瓜，青而亮的西瓜，其貌不扬的椰子，桔色的柑橙，有眼的菠萝黄黄的，无眼的则青紫且大，红艳艳的西红柿，还有苹果、梨及一些我们叫不出名的干鲜果，琳琅满目。四季鲜菜应有尽有，肉类既鲜又便宜。至于傣家特制的烤鱼、烤鸡、烤罗索、酸笋等，更诱人食欲。我们花4角钱1公斤买了几只西瓜，1角钱1公斤买了一兜西红柿，边吃边嚷：“我们今年提前过夏天了。”可不是吗，此时北方即使有西瓜，也贵得令人咋舌，这里却瓜果满市了。祖国山河真辽阔啊！
