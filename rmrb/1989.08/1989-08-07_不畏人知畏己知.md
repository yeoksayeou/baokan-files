	Fear Not the Knowledge of Others, but One's Own

	While reading the "Caoming County Gazette," I came across the story of a clean official from Caoming during the Qing Dynasty, Ye Cunren.

	In the fourth year of the Yongzheng reign, Ye Cunren was recommended by the Minister of Rites, Wang Tubin, and subsequently served in various positions in Huaiyang, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan. He served for over thirty years, content with simplicity and never taking bribes. Once, when he was leaving his post, his subordinates sent a boat to see him off, bidding farewell with reluctance. The boat did not set off until the moon was high. Suddenly, a small boat was seen approaching. It turned out that the subordinates had sent him parting gifts, avoiding public attention by sending them at night. They thought that Ye Cunren, who usually did not accept gifts, was afraid of being soft-hearted if he took them. This time, they believed he would definitely accept the gifts. However, upon seeing this, Ye Cunren immediately ordered his attendants to prepare writing materials and wrote a poem on the spot. The poem read: "Under the bright moon and cool wind at midnight, a small boat sends me off reluctantly. I appreciate your deep feelings and return your gifts, fearing not the knowledge of others but my own." After finishing the poem, he returned the gifts to the subordinates.

	What is admirable is his ability to be strict with himself. During his tenure as the Prefect of Hangzhou, the Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi never took bribes or sought personal gain. However, after he returned home, he discovered that he had made a mistake: he had written a poem of self-reflection: "For three years as Prefect, I drank water and ate leaves. Only at Tianzhu Mountain, I took two pieces of stone. This is worth more than a thousand gold, and it is not right to damage my integrity." This refers to his taking two beloved stones from Tianzhu Mountain during his visit. He felt sorry for Hangzhou and Tianzhu Mountain, thinking that if visitors all took stones, Tianzhu Mountain would be "no longer a mountain." This loss was equivalent to embezzling a thousand gold, which was not something a clean official should do.

	People should have self-awareness and be able to be strict with themselves in solitude, fearing that their reputation will be damaged! However, some people know that accepting gifts and bribes will damage their integrity, but they still accept them without hesitation, having no fear. In their view, as long as others do not know and there are no receipts, they are not afraid of anything. They only fear the knowledge of others but not their own, and thus they act recklessly. "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." If one does not know they are wrong and is not afraid of being wrong, they are not far from "heart death." Once the heart dies, a person's core will rot.

   不畏人知畏己知
    读《咸宁县志》，见清代咸宁籍清官叶存仁的故事。
    雍正四年，叶存仁由礼部侍郎王图炳保举，先后在淮阳、浙江、安徽、河南等地任官。他为官三十余年，甘于淡泊，毫不苟取。有一次，他在离任时，僚属派船舶送行，依依话别，船迟迟不肯启程，直到明月高挂，但见划来一叶小舟。原来是僚属们为他送来临别馈赠，为避人耳目，特地夜里送来。他们满以为叶存仁平时不收礼物是怕拿人的手软，这次临别馈赠肯定会收下。但叶存仁看到这情景，立即叫随从备好文房四宝，即兴书诗一首，诗云：“月白清风夜半时，扁舟相送故迟迟。感君情重还君赠，不畏人知畏己知。”书毕，即将僚属的馈赠“完璧归赵”了。
    可贵之处，在于能够严于律己。唐代诗人白居易在任杭州刺史期间，从不贪污、苟得什么。但当他离任回家后，竟发现自己做了件错事，即写了一首自省诗：“三年为刺史，饮水复食叶，惟向天竺山，取得两片石。此抵有千金，无乃伤清白。”这说的是他在游天竺山时，带回两颗心爱的山石。他因此感到对不起杭州，对不起天竺山，若游客都这样带石子，天竺山便“山将不山”了。这种损失，抵得上贪污千金，不像为官清白者所应做的。
    人贵有自知之明，能够在“慎独”中严于律己，唯恐有损自己的声誉！但有些人明知接受别人的馈赠、贿物有伤自己的清白，却照受不误，毫无“畏”心。在这种人看来，只要别人不知道，“不开发票”，不留字据，就不怕什么。他们只“畏人知”，却不“畏己知”，因此便妄自为之。“哀莫大于心死”。自己身在错中不知错，不怕错，离“心死”不远了，心一死，人的内瓤就腐败了。　余仁
