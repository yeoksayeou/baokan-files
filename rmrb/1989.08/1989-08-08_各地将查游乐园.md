		Local authorities across the country will soon inspect amusement parks. In recent years, the amusement park industry has rapidly developed in various regions of China. However, due to inadequate management, lack of necessary quality supervision and safety measures, there are numerous potential hazards, and personal injury incidents frequently occur.

		The State Administration of Work Safety recently issued a notice requiring the China Amusement and Recreation Facilities Association to organize a nationwide safety inspection of amusement rides and facilities by the end of September. The inspection will focus on large and medium-sized amusement rides and will be conducted in three phases: self-inspection, mutual inspection, and key spot checks.
