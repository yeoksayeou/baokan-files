    Linyi Dispatches Officials to Strengthen Grassroots Poverty Alleviation, Implementing Responsibility, Authority, and Benefits Integration

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Shandong Province's Linyi Region has dispatched over 2,000 officials from the regional and county levels to underdeveloped areas to take responsibility for villages, factories, and research projects. This initiative has not only trained the officials but also improved the weak state of grassroots work, earning the welcome of the local populace.

    This work began last year.

    Linyi Region is an economically and culturally underdeveloped agricultural area. In the past, the Regional Committee and the Regional Government had selected many full-time officials to strengthen the grassroots. However, due to the lack of integration of responsibility, authority, and benefits, some of the dispatched officials lacked a sense of responsibility and often could not stay in their posts or get close to the people. To address this, the Regional Committee and the Regional Government have made three improvements to the work of dispatching officials: changing the responsibility area to a fixed-point contract system. For 1,800 officials dispatched to poverty alleviation, specific responsibility systems have been implemented, and 710 full-time officials have been selected to directly take up positions in underdeveloped units. Among them, 210 have taken on the roles of village party branch secretaries or village committee directors, while others have taken responsibility for underdeveloped enterprises and research projects, with contract periods generally ranging from 1 to 3 years; changing the assessment system to a contract, assessment, and reward-punishment system. Various indicators, requirements, timelines, and results have been signed in the form of contracts, linking them to the salaries, bonuses, and promotions of the dispatched officials. Semi-annual audits and annual summaries are conducted to ensure implementation; changing the management of various systems and departments to unified coordination by the organizational and personnel departments. The organizational and personnel departments register and file records, establish files, conduct regular assessments, and promote or reward those with outstanding contributions, significantly boosting their enthusiasm. Fei County dispatched 104 full-time officials last year to take responsibility for 75 impoverished villages. Over the past year, these officials have actively disseminated information, provided technical services, and led cadres and the masses in hard work and entrepreneurship. They have built over 200 kilometers of new roads, treated and cultivated over 5,000 mu of land, expanded and improved the area of irrigated land by over 5,000 mu, started 401 sideline and secondary industry projects, and arranged employment for 4,200 surplus laborers. The per capita income of the villages taken over last year increased by 50 yuan.

    临沂选派干部充实基层扶  贫实行责权利相结合
    本报讯　山东省临沂地区选派2000多名地、县脱产干部到落后地区包村包厂包科研项目，既锻炼了干部，又改变了基层工作薄弱的状况，受到群众的欢迎。
    这项工作是从去年开始的。
    临沂地区是一个经济文化比较落后的农业大区。过去，地委、行署也先后选拔过不少脱产干部充实到基层。但由于责权利没有很好结合，使一部分下派的干部缺乏责任感，往往蹲不住，靠不上。为此，地委行署这次对下派干部工作进行了3方面的改进：改包片定点为定标挂职承包。对地、县1800名挂职扶贫干部落实了具体的责任制，选拔了710名脱产干部直接到落后单位任职，其中有210人担任了村党支书或村委主任，还有的承包了落后企业和科研项目，合同期一般为1至3年；改定性考核为合同制、考核制、奖惩制结合。将各项指标完成的要求、时间、结果以合同的形式签订下来，同下派干部的工资、奖金、提拔使用挂起钩来，半年审计，年终总结兑现；改各系统、各部门分头管理为组织人事部门统一协调管理。组织人事部门登记造册，建档立卡，定期考核，有突出贡献的给予晋升工资或提拔重用，极大地调动了他们的积极性。费县去年选派104名脱产干部挂职承包75个贫困村。一年来这些干部积极传递信息，提供技术服务，带领干部群众艰苦创业，新修道路200多公里，治山整地5000多亩，扩大改善水浇地面积5000多亩，上工副业项目401个，安排剩余劳力4200人。去年被承包的这些村人均收入增加了50元。　（厉彦林　马黎明）
