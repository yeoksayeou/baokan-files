Tongliao has become the first county-level insurance market in China, with all four major insurance lines—enterprise property, motor vehicle, personal, and household property—exceeding the prescribed standards.

Tongliao City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has over a thousand industrial and commercial enterprises, with a total fixed asset value of 10 billion yuan. It is one of the major commercial grain production bases. Last March, a fire at the city's paper mill caused significant losses. However, because the mill had participated in insurance before the disaster, it received 2.08 million yuan in compensation after the fire, allowing the factory to quickly resume production.

    通辽成为首家县级保险市
    新华社呼和浩特8月16日电（通讯员刘梦杰、王永海）内蒙古自治区通辽市企业财产、机动车辆、人身和家庭财产四大险种的业务全部超过规定标准，成为我国第一个县级保险市。
    通辽市有工商企业上千家，城市全部固定资产达100亿元，是重要商品粮基地之一。去年3月，市造纸厂一场火灾造成巨额损失，由于灾前参加了保险，灾后获得208万元赔付，工厂迅速恢复了生产。
