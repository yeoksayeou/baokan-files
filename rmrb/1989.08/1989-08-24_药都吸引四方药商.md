The main production area for medicinal herbs in Anhui is in northern Huai, and the main production area for medicinal herbs in northern Huai is in Bozhou. The Qing Dynasty poet Liu Kai once wrote a poem praising it: "Outside the small yellow city, the peony flowers bloom, ten li or five li of morning glory, in front of the flowers and behind the flowers are all houses, and every house grows medicine like mulberry and hemp." This is a true portrayal of the hometown of Hua Tuo, which is famous for producing white peony. The people of Bozhou have been growing medicinal herbs for over 1,700 years. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Bozhou had already become a famous national center for the distribution of medicinal herbs, known as one of the "Four Great Medicine Cities" in the country. In the fields of planting, processing, and trading medicinal herbs, the people of Bozhou have rich experience and unique techniques. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the production and trading of medicinal herbs in Bozhou have developed significantly. Now, the area of medicinal herb cultivation has expanded to 100,000 mu, and the varieties have increased from the original dozens to more than 150. There are more than 360 licensed pharmacies and drugstores in the county. If mobile merchants and specialized households are included, there are more than 100,000 people in the city who are engaged in the cultivation and trading of medicinal herbs, with an annual turnover of more than 500 million yuan. Since 1985, Bozhou has held an annual "Medicine Trade Fair" in the autumn, attracting merchants from all over the country. The fair is bustling with activity, and the transaction volume increases year by year, reaching 180 million yuan last year.

    药都吸引四方药商
    安徽家种药材主要产地在淮北，而淮北的中药材产地又主要在亳州。清初诗人刘开曾写诗赞曰：“小黄城外芍药花，十里五里生朝霞，花前花后皆人家，家家种药如桑麻。”这是对盛产白芍的华佗故乡的真实写照。亳州人种中药材已有1700多年的历史了，明、清时亳州已成为全国著名的中药材集散地，被誉为全国“四大药都”之一。在中药材的种植、加工、经营等方面，亳州人有着丰富的经验和独到的技术。尤其是在党的十一届三中全会以后，亳州的中药材生产和经营有了很大的发展，现在中药材种植面积已扩大到10万亩，品种也由原来的几十种扩大到150多种，全县光挂牌营业的药行、药店就有360多家。如果加上流动行商和专业户，全市种植和经营中药材的有10万多人，每年营业额达5亿多元。自1985年以来，亳州每年秋天都举办一次全国规模的“药交会”，到时全国各地客商云集，热闹非凡，成交额逐年增加，去年达1.8亿元。
