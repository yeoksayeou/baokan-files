Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st.

The Supreme Soviet of the USSR today adopted an appeal to the US Congress on the issue of suspending nuclear explosions and stopping nuclear tests. The appeal states that the USSR is ready at any time to announce a suspension of all nuclear explosions on the basis of mutual equality.

The appeal says that the issue of a comprehensive cessation of nuclear test explosions has been raised for more than 20 years. To resolve this issue as soon as possible, the USSR is prepared to take all necessary and possible actions. Currently, the USSR advocates for the immediate start of specific studies on the issue of a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests at the Geneva Disarmament Conference.

The appeal proposes that legislators from the USSR and the US hold a meeting in the near future in Moscow or Washington to discuss the above issues.

In July 1985, Soviet leader Gorbachev proposed to the United States to stop all nuclear weapon tests comprehensively and announced that the USSR would unilaterally stop tests from August 6 to December 31 of the same year. The USSR later extended the suspension period several times until February 28, 1987, when the USSR resumed nuclear explosions. This was because the United States conducted two nuclear tests on February 3 and 11 of the same year.

Since the beginning of this year, the USSR has conducted 4 nuclear tests.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 2nd.

The German Democratic Republic supports the appeal made by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to the US Congress to suspend nuclear explosions and completely stop all nuclear tests, believing that this is in line with the requirements of the times.

On August 2nd, Deputy Spokesman of the GDR Foreign Ministry, Dennis Rue, made a statement to the German News Agency, pointing out that the proposals and initiatives put forward by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in the appeal are conducive to the realization of the goal of a nuclear-free world.

The spokesman said that the GDR has always advocated for multilateral talks on the issue of a comprehensive cessation of nuclear tests and believes that "the proposal for a comprehensive and thorough ban on nuclear tests by socialist countries and the GDR's proposal to sign a monitoring agreement can serve as the basis for discussion."

The GDR believes that the suspension of nuclear explosions by the USSR and the United States will create a beneficial atmosphere for talks among all countries on this issue.

    苏最高苏维埃向美国会发出呼吁
    平等地暂停一切核试验
    民德认为苏联呼吁符合时代要求
    新华社莫斯科8月1日电  苏联最高苏维埃今天就暂停核爆炸和停止核试验问题通过了致美国国会的呼吁书。呼吁书表示，苏联随时准备在相互平等的基础上宣布暂停一切核爆炸。
    呼吁书说，全面停止试验性核爆炸的问题已经提出20多年了，为了尽快解决这一问题，苏联准备采取一切必要的和可能的行动。目前，苏联主张在日内瓦裁军会议上立即开始具体研究全面禁止核试验问题。
    呼吁书建议，苏美两国议员近期在莫斯科或华盛顿举行会晤，以讨论上述问题。
    1985年7月，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫曾向美国建议两国全面停止核武器试验，并宣布苏联自同年8月6日至12月31日单方面停止试验。以后苏联又几次延长暂停期限，直至1987年2月底苏联才恢复核爆炸，这是因为同年2月3日和11日美国先后进行了两次核试验。
    今年以来，苏联已进行了4次核试验。
    新华社柏林8月2日电民主德国支持苏联最高苏维埃向美国国会发出的关于暂停核爆炸，彻底停止一切核试验的呼吁，认为这是符合时代要求的。
    民主德国外交部副发言人德尼斯·鲁2日对德通社发表谈话时指出，苏联最高苏维埃在呼吁中所提出的这些建议和倡议，有助于建立一个无核世界目标的实现。
    这位发言人说，民主德国一直主张就全面停止核试验的问题进行多边会谈，认为“社会主义国家提出的全面、彻底禁止核试验的建议和民主德国提出的签署一项监督协定的建议可以作为讨论的基础”。
    民主德国认为，苏联和美国暂停核爆炸，会为世界各国就这个问题进行会谈创造一种有益的气氛。
