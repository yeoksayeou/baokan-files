The Party Central Committee and the State Council have significantly increased investment in Tibet's infrastructure this year, despite the nationwide trend of reducing basic construction scales. Statistics show that this year's state investment in Tibet has increased by 57.4% compared to last year. Including local investments, the total investment in infrastructure this year amounts to over 450 million yuan.

This is the second significant investment in Tibet since 1984 and 1985, when the state invested in 43 construction projects. This year's investment is primarily directed towards transportation, energy infrastructure, and the renovation of old residential areas in Lhasa, as well as the construction of the city's water supply system.

Tibet is a region with immense economic potential waiting to be developed. From the early 1950s, when it was peacefully liberated, until 1988, the state provided Tibet with a cumulative financial subsidy and various special allocations totaling 15.97 billion yuan to support and assist in its economic development and to improve and elevate the people's living standards. Since 1980, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have further implemented policies to benefit ethnic minorities, adopting a series of tax exemptions and policies to promote recovery and development. These measures have injected new vitality into Tibet's economic development, significantly improving the living standards of its people.

This year, nearly 50% of the total investment is allocated to transportation and energy infrastructure, making it the largest scale in recent years. The state's investment of 190 million yuan in expanding Gonggar Airport will open a smoother air corridor for Tibet. The reconstruction of the Black (River) to Changdu (Chamdo) Highway has strengthened connections between Tibet and inland regions. The soon-to-be-completed section of the China-Nepal Highway from Quxu to Zham (Zhamkhar) will not only shorten the distance between Lhasa and southwestern Tibet but also facilitate economic and trade exchanges with Nepal and other South Asian countries. Additionally, the third phase of the Yangbajing Geothermal Power Station and the renovation of Lhasa's power supply system will improve industrial, ethnic handicraft, and residential electricity conditions in the autonomous region's capital.

This year, the state and the autonomous region have also invested over 62 million yuan in housing construction and the renovation of dangerous residential buildings in Lhasa, accounting for 13.5% of the total investment this year, the highest in history.

The North Suburb Water Plant, scheduled to go into operation in the fourth quarter of this year with a daily water supply capacity of 25,000 tons, will further improve the water supply conditions for Lhasa residents. Currently, more than ten key construction projects arranged by the state and Tibet are under intense construction.

    国家增加对西藏基建投资
    主要用于交通能源建设和拉萨老城区改造
    新华社拉萨8月1日电  （记者柴怀吉、张春保）党中央和国务院今年在压缩全国性基本建设规模的形势下，对西藏的基建投资有大幅度增加。据统计，今年国家对西藏投资较去年增加了57.4％，加上西藏地方投资，今年基建投资总规模达到4.5亿多元。
    这是继1984年、1985年国家投资在西藏兴建43项工程建设以来的又一次较大规模投资。这次投资主要用于西藏的交通、能源建设，以及拉萨的老城区居民住房改造和城市供水系统的建设。
    西藏是经济潜力巨大的待开发区。从50年代初和平解放至1988年，国家为支持和帮助西藏发展经济，改善和提高人民的生活，累计给予财政补贴和各项专项拨款达159.7亿元。从1980年以后，党中央和国务院进一步落实民族政策，对西藏采取了一系列免征免税的休养生息政策，给西藏的经济发展增加了新的活力，人民生活水平明显提高。
    今年占总投资近50％的交通、能源建设，是近几年中规模最大的。国家投资1.9亿元扩建的贡嘎机场，将为西藏打开一条更为顺畅的空中走廊；黑（河）昌（都）公路的改建，增加了西藏与内地的联系；即将建成的中尼公路曲（水）大
  （竹卡）路段，不仅缩短了拉萨与西藏西南部城乡的距离，而且使西藏与尼泊尔等南亚诸国的经济贸易往来更加密切；新增加投资的羊八井地热电站三期工程的实施及拉萨供电系统的改造，将使自治区首府的工业、民族手工业和居民用电条件得到改善。
    今年，国家和自治区还对一些县、区、乡的房建和拉萨市居民危房改造工程投资6200多万元，占今年总投资的13.5％，是历年来投资最多的年份。
    今年第四季度将要投产的日供水2.5万吨自来水的北郊水厂，可使拉萨居民用水条件进一步改善。现在，国家和西藏安排的十多项重点建设工程正在紧张的施工。
