Today's issue of the *Market News* published a letter from Nanjing resident Wang Aimin, questioning the value of the "Jinling Beer Festival," where vendors profit while citizens gain nothing.

The letter states that since 1987, Nanjing has added another festival: the "Jinling Beer Festival," held annually from July 12 to 19. In 1988, during the week-long festival, "Jinling Beer" was only available for two or three days. This year, the situation has worsened. I visited the sales points multiple times but saw only wholesale transactions, not retail. Thousands of bottles of "Jinling Beer" were all taken by individual vendors through various connections, leaving ordinary citizens with no benefits.

The *Market News* published an editorial titled "Rectifying Festival Trends." The editorial points out that in recent years, various festivals related to commodity circulation have increased. Using festivals as a medium to facilitate production and sales, and increase commodity sales, can be beneficial for both enterprises and consumers in today's socialist commodity economy. However, some festivals are poorly organized, and some are even disastrous. Some festivals only collect money from enterprises without proper promotion; some misuse public funds for lavish banquets, wasting resources; some claim to offer discounts but do not provide goods; some charge exorbitant ticket prices, with tickets costing 5 to 10 yuan each; some use the opportunity to push low-quality, stagnant goods...

The editorial suggests that relevant departments should investigate the festivals within their jurisdiction to see if there are any unhealthy trends behind the festive scenes.

### 商贩捞好处　市民无益处  “金陵啤酒节”风气不正

    商贩捞好处　市民无益处
    “金陵啤酒节”风气不正
    本报讯　今天出版的《市场报》刊登南京市民王爱民的来信，提出对商贩们捞好处，于市民却无益的“金陵啤酒节”，究竟还有多少保留价值的问题。
    信中说，自1987年起，南京市又多了一个节日，每年从7月12日到19日，举办“金陵啤酒节”。1988年，为期一周的啤酒节满打满算也只两三天能见到“金陵啤酒”。今年，可谓“王小二过年，一年不如一年”。我先后多次前往销售点，只见批发，不见零售，成百上千瓶“金陵啤酒”全部让个体商贩通过这样那样的关系“批发”走了，普通市民享受不到好处。
    《市场报》为此发表题为《端正“节”风》的社论。社论指出：这几年，与商品流通有关的各种“节”骤然增多。以节为媒，促成产销见面，增加商品销售。在发展社会主义商品经济的今天，这类节如举办得好，对企业、对消费者大有好处。
    但是，也有一些“节日”办得不怎么样，甚至是极糟的。有的只收企业的钱，却不管宣传；有的滥用公款，大宴宾客，挥霍浪费；有的美其名曰让利销售，却不见商品；有的门票贵得吓人，开价就要5元10元；有的借机推销劣质呆滞商品……
    建议有关部门查查所辖范围内的这个节那个节，看看在热闹的“节日景象”背后，是否有这样那样的不正之风。
