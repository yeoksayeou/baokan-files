To the spectators in Urumqi, this year's Eight-One Cup tournament was satisfying: the competition was fierce, the matches intense, and even after the final round, four teams had the same points, making it hard to distinguish between the top and bottom teams. However, in the eyes of basketball experts within the military, the situation was quite different: the teams were evenly matched, the competition was intense, but the overall level was not high. The impression the reporter got was that the level of men's basketball in the military is currently declining.

The decline of the powerhouse Eight-One men's basketball team can partly explain the situation. The Eight-One team had long dominated the domestic and even Asian basketball scene, maintaining a strong presence for many years. It has nurtured several generations of national team stars who were once celebrated by fans. In recent years, the team has struggled with a lack of talent and has gradually lost its dominance in national-level competitions, eventually falling to a dismal performance in this year's cup tournament, finishing second to last. On the court, the old players seem out of their depth, the new players are unable to shoulder the responsibility, and there is a lack of coordination between the old and new players. The decline of the Eight-One men's team has left the military without a team capable of challenging for Asian and world-level titles.

The decline of the Eight-One team does not mean the rise of other teams. Including this year's champion, the Air Force team, none of the teams were able to maintain an undefeated record. Teams like the Nanjing Military Region team and the Jinan Military Region team, which once had distinctive styles, now struggle to maintain their former fast and steady playing style. The Eight-One team's once formidable interior offense has also lost its edge. This situation has led to a mix of first and second-tier teams fighting it out, making it hard to see the differences in their levels.

The tournament showed that the main reason for the decline in level is a lack of talent. Many of the old stars have retired, and those still on the court are struggling to maintain their former glory. Teams like Eight-One, Beijing Military Region, and Jinan Military Region are all in this situation. Some teams, like the Shenyang Military Region team, have made efforts to train new players, with an average age that is not high, but have not yet produced any promising young talents. This may indicate that the low point for military men's basketball may not be a short-term issue. If better conditions for attracting talent are not provided, the outlook is not optimistic.

In contrast, the Eight-One women's team, which has long dominated the domestic women's basketball scene, has always been a key part of the national women's team. This is also a source of pride for the Eight-One team.

Considering the role of basketball in military sports and the responsibility to reach the world's highest levels, one cannot help but be concerned about the declining trend shown by the People's Liberation Army men's basketball team.

    忧虑与期待
    ——评第三届八一杯全军篮球赛
    在乌鲁木齐的观众看来，本届八一杯赛是令人满意的：争夺激烈，赛事紧张，直至打完最后一轮比赛仍有4个队积分相等，上下难分。但是在军内篮坛的行家们看来就大不相同了：实力相当，角逐激烈，水平不高。记者得到的印象是：部队男篮的水平目前正呈下坡趋势。
    劲旅八一男篮的衰落可以部分地说明问题。八一男篮曾经多年雄视国内乃至亚洲篮坛，可谓长盛不衰，它为国家队培养出的数代名将被爱好者传颂一时。近几年来，八一队开始人才不济，在全国性大赛上渐渐无法独占鳌头，直至滑落到本届杯赛上的惨败，仅获倒数第二名。从场上队员看，老队员显得力不从心，新队员无力担当重任，新老队员间又缺乏配合。八一男篮水平的下降，使部队缺少了一支向亚洲和世界水平冲击的队伍。
    八一队的衰落，并不能说明其它队伍的崛起。包括本次冠军空军队在内，各队均无法保持不败。曾经颇具特点的南京部队队与济南部队队，现在难以看出原来那满场飞奔、快速稳健的风格；八一队以前擅长的内线进攻也威力大减。这种情况造成本应不在同一级别上的甲乙级队伍间混战一团，看不出水平差别。
    赛事说明，水平下降的主要原因是缺乏人才。老的名将多已退役，尚在场上拚搏的大都力不从心，无力重现当年英姿。八一队、北京部队队、济南部队队都是如此。个别球队如沈阳部队队虽然下决心锻炼新手，队员平均年龄不大，却也尚未涌现具有发展前途的苗子。这也许预示着部队男篮的低谷可能不是一个很短的过程。如果不能得到更好的条件吸收人才，前景不乐观。
    与此相反，一直称霸国内女子篮坛的八一女队却始终是国家女篮中的骨干。这也是八一队值得骄傲和自豪之处。
    考虑到篮球运动在部队体育中的地位，考虑到攀登世界高峰的责任，就不能不使人们对解放军男子篮球显示的下降趋势而忧心忡忡了。
