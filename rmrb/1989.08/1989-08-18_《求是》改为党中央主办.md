The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided that the theoretical journal "Seeking Truth," which was previously published under the auspices of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, will now be published directly by the Central Committee. According to the Central Committee's requirements, "Seeking Truth" will, as a theoretical journal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, earnestly carry out propaganda for the central task of economic construction, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and persist in reform and opening up. At present, it will implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization. "Seeking Truth" will strive to propagate Marxism, actively carry out theoretical exploration and debate, and play a greater role in cultivating theoretical cadres.

    《求是》改为党中央主办
    新华社北京8月18日电　中共中央最近作出决定，原来党中央委托中共中央党校主办的全党的理论刊物《求是》杂志，改为党中央主办。根据中央要求，《求是》杂志作为中共中央的理论刊物，将认真作好以经济建设为中心、坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的宣传。在当前，要贯彻党的十三届四中全会的精神，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。《求是》杂志将努力宣传马克思主义，积极开展理论上的探索与争鸣，并在培养理论队伍方面发挥更大的作用。
