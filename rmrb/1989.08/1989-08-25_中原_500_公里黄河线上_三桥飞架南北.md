The Yellow River flows 500 kilometers through Henan Province. From 1977, tracing back to the dawn of our civilization, for thousands of years, there had never been a single highway bridge on this 500-kilometer stretch of the river. Even in the countless poems written by our poets about the Yellow River, there was not a single word or phrase about a bridge.

The myth has finally appeared in a mythical era!

— On January 1, 1977, the Luohe Yellow River Highway Bridge was successfully completed. The bridge is 3,428.9 meters long, allowing three large trucks to drive side by side. At that time, it was the longest highway bridge in China.

— On October 1, 1986, the Zhengzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge was inaugurated. The bridge is 5,549.86 meters long and 18.5 meters wide. At that time, it was again the longest highway bridge in China.

— According to news from the Yellow River in Kaifeng, we can now confidently announce: on October 1 this year, cars will travel south and north on the Kaifeng Yellow River Highway Bridge, which is 4,475.09 meters long and 18.5 meters wide.

From 1977 to 1989, in just 13 years, three bridges—Luo, Zheng, and Bian—have been built across the Yellow River, connecting the north and south. This is truly a miracle!

This miracle is remarkable because it is a stark historical contrast. The site of the Zhengzhou Bridge, Huayuankou, was once a massive wound for the Chinese nation—in 1938, the Kuomintang breached the dike here, causing the Yellow River to flood thousands of miles, turning 44 counties and cities in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, covering 54,000 square kilometers, into a marshland. Over 12 million people were displaced, and 890,000 people lost their lives in the flood. This was a horrific tragedy! Meanwhile, during the Anti-Japanese War, the local militia often tied gourds around their waists and swam across the Yellow River at night to attack the Japanese invaders, earning the title of "Gourd Squad." During the War of Liberation, our liberation army crossed the Yellow River here using wooden sailboats to pursue the Kuomintang reactionaries. The foundations of our bridges are firmly planted in this riverbed, rich with deep national hatred and heavy historical significance, making them incredibly sturdy.

This miracle is remarkable because it is a stark social contrast. Not far upstream from the Zhengzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge is an old retired railway bridge. Built by the Qing Dynasty in 1901 and contracted to a Belgian company, it took five years and 2.65 million taels of silver to complete. However, the foundations were only 14 meters deep, allowing only small locomotives to pass, and large amounts of stone had to be thrown into the river every year during the flood season to protect the bridge piers. This old bridge and the new double-track railway bridge next to it were completed and opened to traffic in 1960. Yuan Shikai, the Beiyang warlord, once planned to build a bridge here and invited experts from nine countries to present 29 bridge construction plans, but none could solve the problem of foundation depth. The Kuomintang government also tried twice to build a bridge with the help of American experts. The first time, a wooden pile was only driven 10 meters into the ground, and they gave up. The second time, they spent $100,000 on the design, but not a single drawing was produced. Our three highway bridges, however, were designed and constructed entirely by our country, by the province of Henan. The Zhengzhou Bridge was completed in just two years and two months, with foundations reaching 65 meters deep, ensuring the bridge can withstand a once-in-300-year flood and a magnitude 7 earthquake without moving an inch. This is not a vivid portrayal of the superiority of one social system over another?

The Luo, Zheng, and Bian Yellow River Highway Bridges are like three ribbons, tightly connecting the north and south of our motherland. Just on the Zhengzhou Bridge, thousands of vehicles pass through every day, heading north and south. The roar of the engines and the surging Yellow River waves together perform a new Yellow River symphony, singing the prosperity and flourishing of our motherland.

Ah, the Yellow River flows into the sea...

### 中原500公里黄河线上——三桥飞架南北

    中原500公里黄河线上——
    三桥飞架南北
    黄河入海流……
    滔滔黄河在河南境内有500公里长的河道。自公元1977年起上溯至我们文明史的开端，数千年间，这500公里长的河道上不曾有过一座公路桥的影子；就是在我们历代诗人们数不清的面对黄河的咏叹中，也不曾有过一字一句关于桥的“浪漫”。
    神话终于在神话般的时代出现了！
    ——1977年1月1日，洛阳黄河公路大桥胜利建成。大桥全长3428.9米，桥上可并驶三辆大卡车。这在当时是我国最长的公路大桥。
    ——1986年10月1日，郑州黄河公路大桥剪彩通车。大桥全长5549.86米，宽18.5米。这在当时又是我国最长的公路大桥。
    ——根据开封黄河河面上传来的新闻，我们现在可以完全自信地宣布：今年10月1日，汽车将在全长4475.09米、宽18.5米的开封黄河公路大桥上南来北往。
    1977年—1989年，短短的13年间，洛、郑、汴这三颗黄河的明珠上，长虹洒落人间，三桥飞架南北，这不能不说是人间奇迹！
    这人间奇迹奇就奇在它是一个鲜明的历史对照。郑州大桥的桥址花园口，曾经是中华民族的巨大伤口——1938年，国民党在这里扒堤决口，致使黄河浊浪一泻千里，豫皖苏三省44个县市、54000平方公里土地沦为泽国，1200多万人民流离失所，89万人民葬身洪流。这是何等的惨绝人寰啊！而洛阳大桥的河面上，抗日战争时期，这一带民兵经常腰系葫芦，夜间泅渡黄河袭击日寇，被誉为英雄的“葫芦队”；解放战争时期，我解放大军南下曾在这一带用木帆船强渡黄河，追击国民党反动派。我们的大桥的基桩就是扎在这样有着深厚的民族恨和浓重的历史感的河底，它当然是坚固无比的。
    这人间奇迹奇就奇在它是一个强烈的社会对比。郑州黄河公路大桥的上游不远处，有一座已经“退役”的老铁路桥。那是1901年清王朝承包给比国公司建造的，历时5年，耗银265万两，结果呢，基桩入土仅14米，只能通行小型机车，每年汛期还得抛掷大量片石防护桥墩。这座老桥和新公路桥中间的复线铁路大桥，是我们1960年建成通车的。北洋军阀段祺瑞曾想在这里建桥，请了9个国家的专家拿出了29个建桥方案，但没有一个能解决基桩的入土深度问题。国民党政府也曾两度请美国专家帮助建桥，头一次一根木桩只进土10米，再也无能为力，只好溜之乎也；第二次花了10万美元搞设计，结果连一张图也没有看到。而我们的三座公路大桥，是我国，是我们国家的一个省——河南省自己设计、自己施工的。郑州大桥仅用了两年又两个月的时间，基桩入土达65米之深，可保大桥在300年一遇特大洪峰和七级地震的冲击下岿然不动安如山。这难道不是两种社会制度孰优孰劣的立体写照吗？
    洛、郑、汴三座黄河公路大桥像三条彩带，把祖国的南北紧密地连在一起。仅在郑州大桥上，每天就有八九千辆车南北驰骋。隆隆的车轮声和滔滔的黄河浪演奏着一曲新的黄河大合唱，合唱着祖国的繁荣和昌盛。
    啊，黄河入海流……
