Members of the CPPCC Medical and Health Committee Discuss Improving the Hospital Contract Responsibility System with Health Department Leaders

New China News Agency, Beijing, August 8 — This afternoon, some members of the CPPCC Medical and Health Committee held a dialogue with leaders of the Health Department at the Nationalities Culture Palace to discuss issues that have arisen during the implementation of the hospital contract responsibility system in China.

Since the second half of last year, an investigative group formed by the CPPCC Medical and Health Committee has conducted extensive investigations into the current state of China's medical and health services. This investigative group, composed of renowned medical experts, has surveyed hundreds of medical and health institutions in 21 provinces and cities and distributed over 2,000 questionnaires.

A report from the investigative group suggests that the hospital contract responsibility system reforms implemented in some areas have achieved noticeable positive results. The problem of difficulty in seeing a doctor, which was prominent in previous years, has been alleviated to some extent, and the enthusiasm of medical workers has also improved. However, there are still many problems. Some medical institutions do not prioritize humanitarianism or social benefits but instead pursue economic benefits. In terms of medical ethics, medical standards, training new personnel, and improving preventive care, there are potential crises that affect the development of China's medical services. The investigative group has put forward their suggestions to change this situation.

During the dialogue, Minister of Health Chen Minzhang and others introduced the situation since the implementation of the hospital contract responsibility system. Chen Minzhang said that the purpose of this reform has never been to pursue economic benefits but rather to strengthen the target management of hospitals. They thanked the members of the CPPCC Medical and Health Committee for their concern for the medical services and hoped that the members would continue to contribute to the reform and development of China's medical services. Vice Chairman of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Medical and Health Committee Qian Zhengying attended the dialogue.

    政协医卫体委员会委员同卫生部领导探讨
    完善医院承包责任制
    新华社北京8月8日电　全国政协医卫体委员会的部分委员今天下午在民族文化宫同卫生部负责人就我国医院承包责任制实行中出现的一些问题进行了对话。
    全国政协医卫体委员会组成的调查组从去年下半年开始就我国医疗卫生事业的现状进行了广泛的调查，这个由著名医学专家组成的调查组，先后调查了21个省市的数百家医疗卫生单位，并发问卷2000多份。
    这个调查组提供的一份调查报告认为，我国目前在一些地方实行的医院承包责任制的改革取得明显较好的效果，前些年比较突出的看病难的问题在一定程度上得到缓解，医务工作者积极性也有了一定的提高。但是目前存在的问题也还不少，一些医疗单位不是从人道主义出发，不顾社会效益，片面追求经济效益，在医德、医风、医疗质量，培养新人，提高预防基础三方面存在着危机的隐患，影响了我国医疗事业的发展。为改变这种状况，调查组提出了他们的建议。
    卫生部部长陈敏章等在对话会上介绍了实行医院承包责任制以来的情况。陈敏章说，实行这项改革的目的从来就不是为了追求经济效益，而是为了加强医院的目标管理。他们感谢政协医卫体的委员们对医疗事业的关心，并希望委员们多为我国医疗事业的改革与发展出谋划策。全国政协副主席、医卫体委员会主任钱正英参加了对话会。
