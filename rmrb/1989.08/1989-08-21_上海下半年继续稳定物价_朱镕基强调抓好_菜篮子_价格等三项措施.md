Shanghai will continue to stabilize prices in the second half of the year, with a focus on three key measures, according to Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji.

Zhu Rongji emphasized that all economic work and measures in Shanghai for the second half of the year must prioritize and serve the goal of stabilizing prices. "Once prices are stabilized, the market will be stable, people's minds will be at ease, and their enthusiasm will be unleashed, leading to increased production and construction," he said.

It is understood that Shanghai's economy has maintained a stable development trend this year. In the first half of the year, the city's total industrial output value reached 65.9 billion yuan, a 10% increase over the same period last year. Fiscal revenue grew by 2.4% compared to the same period last year. Since February, Shanghai's price index has seen a monthly decline, bank deposits have significantly increased, the downward trend in foreign trade exports has been halted, and pork, poultry, eggs, fish, and vegetables have seen increased production. The city has achieved a stable market, stable prices, and stable public sentiment.

To further stabilize prices, Zhu Rongji stressed the need to continue implementing three key measures: First, stabilize the prices of "basket of goods" items. The city will firmly implement subsidies at the municipal, district, and county levels, with the municipal finance allocating 3 billion yuan this year for subsidies on grains, oils, and other food items. Every effort will be made to improve the scale and production efficiency of the "basket of goods" project, ensuring that the benefits reach the people. Second, stabilize the prices of industrial consumer goods. Continue to strengthen the monitoring of 51 basic consumer goods. Third, stabilize the prices of small commodities. The materials department will arrange for a portion of low-priced raw materials to support the production of small commodities.

    上海下半年继续稳定物价
    朱镕基强调抓好“菜篮子”价格等三项措施
    本报上海8月21日电　记者萧关根、刘士安报道：中共上海市委书记、市长朱镕基日前提出：“今年下半年上海经济工作的重点是继续稳定物价，为此，要坚持稳定物价的三项措施。”
    朱镕基强调，上海下半年一切经济工作和经济措施都要考虑和服从稳定物价。物价稳住了，市场稳住了，人心就安定了，人的积极性就会发挥出来，生产和建设就能够搞上去。
    据了解，今年以来上海经济保持了稳定发展的势头，上半年工业总产值达到659亿元，比去年同期增长10％，财政收入比去年同期增长2.4％。2月份以后上海物价指数涨幅逐月回落，银行存款有了较大幅度的上升，外贸出口滑坡趋势已得到制止，猪禽蛋鱼菜全面增产，全市出现了市场稳、物价稳、人心稳的局面。
    为了进一步稳定物价，朱镕基强调要继续坚持稳定物价的三项措施：一是稳定“菜篮子”价格。坚定不移地实行市、区、县三级补贴，市财政今年用于粮、油、副食品等项的全部补贴达30个亿。要千方百计提高菜篮子工程的规模效益和生产效益，让实惠真正落到群众手里。二是稳定工业消费品价格。继续加强对51种基本消费品的监控。三是稳定小商品价格。物资部门要增加安排一部分平价原材料扶持小商品生产。
