Upon entering the jurisdiction of Qinyang County, it feels like entering the "Glass Fiber Kingdom." Along the highway from Xixiang Township to Ziling Township, factories producing glass fiber products, operated by townships, villages, and joint households, are almost back-to-back.

County Magistrate Yan Yangde, like reciting a list of treasures, told the reporter: The world's first all-plastic car with a glass fiber body was born in Qinyang; a large glass fiber ball screen with world-advanced technology was unveiled in Qinyang; the largest glass fiber cooling tower in the country appeared in Qinyang; the ultra-low noise cooling tower produced by Qinyang people was installed in Zhongnanhai for use...

Qinyang was historically part of Huaiqing Prefecture and is located at the southern foot of the Taihang Mountains. In the early 1970s, when the glass fiber industry was quietly emerging, the astute people of Qinyang quickly recognized it as a "money tree" and pinned their hopes for prosperity on it.

Industrial development alone cannot rely on the wisdom of farmers. The people of Qinyang, in order to ride the wings of science and technology, flocked to affiliate with colleges, universities, and research design units. The Zhao Zhai Glass Fiber Factory alone hired more than 30 senior engineers and 90 engineers as technical consultants from outside, and established long-term business relationships with 39 research institutions.

Today, Qinyang's glass fiber industry has an annual output value of 180 million yuan. With a population of only 370,000, Qinyang has more than 380 glass fiber production enterprises. Qinyang County has developed into the largest glass fiber production base in China.

Old farmers like Niu Yurui and Chen Xiujian, who have spent half their lives tilling the soil, have now not only become outstanding farmer entrepreneurs but have also been elected as directors of the National Glass Fiber Industry Association. Almost all individual glass fiber production households in the county are members of the National Glass Fiber Industry Association.

In November 1988, the China Glass Fiber Industry Association commemorated the 30th anniversary of the development of the glass fiber industry and awarded certificates of honor. A large stack of them belonged to the people of Qinyang.

Qinyang County is indeed deserving of the title "Glass Fiber Kingdom"!

### 访“玻璃钢王国”

    访“玻璃钢王国”
    进入沁阳县境内，犹如来到“玻璃钢王国”。在西向乡通往紫陵乡的公路两旁，乡、村和联户办的玻璃钢制品厂几乎一座挨一座。
    县长阎仰德如数家珍般告诉记者：世界上第一辆全塑汽车玻璃钢车体在沁阳诞生；具有世界先进水平的大型玻璃钢球屏幕在沁阳问世；全国最大的玻璃钢凉水塔在沁阳出现；沁阳人生产的超低噪音冷却塔被送进中南海安装使用……
    沁阳古属怀庆府，位于太行山南麓。70年代初期，当玻璃钢工业悄然兴起的时候，精明的沁阳人就敏锐地认定这是一棵“摇钱树”，并把致富的希望系在了这棵树上。
    搞工业仅靠庄稼汉的精明不行。沁阳人为了插上科技的翅膀，纷纷挂靠大专院校、科研设计单位，仅赵寨玻璃钢厂就从外聘请了30多位高级工程师、90多位工程师担任科技顾问，还与39家科研单位建立了长期的业务联系。
    如今沁阳的玻璃钢工业年产值达1.8亿元，仅有37万人口的沁阳，却有玻璃钢生产厂家380多个。沁阳县已发展成为我国最大的玻璃钢生产基地。
    半辈子在土坷垃里刨食的老农民牛玉瑞、陈修俭，现在不仅成为优秀的农民企业家，而且还当选为全国玻璃钢工业协会的理事。全县的个体玻璃钢生产户几乎都是全国玻璃钢工业协会的会员。
    1988年11月，中国玻璃钢工业协会纪念玻璃钢工业发展30周年，颁发荣誉证书，属于沁阳人的就有一大摞。
    沁阳县被称为“玻璃钢王国”，确是当之无愧的！
