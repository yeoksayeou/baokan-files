Heihe, which is separated from the Soviet city of Blagoveshchensk by just a river, is the largest border city in China along the Sino-Soviet border and one of the earliest regions to engage in border trade. With the expansion of border trade and the opening of "one-day tours," there are now six scheduled flights per week to the provincial capital. The railway from Harbin to Heihe is expected to be operational within the year. Microwave telephone and fax services with the Soviet Amur Oblast are already in operation. Over the past year, economic and trade activities with the Soviet Union have developed rapidly. Barter trade contracts worth 2 billion Swiss francs have been signed, with 30% already fulfilled. There are over 700 types of imported and exported goods, and there are more than 60 trading partners.

    边贸重镇  黑河
    与苏联布拉戈维申斯克仅一江之隔的黑河，是中苏边境上我国最大的口岸城市，也是开展边贸最早的地区之一。随着边贸日益扩大和“一日游”的开通，现在每周有6次班机飞往省城。哈尔滨到黑河铁路年内也即将通车。与苏联阿穆尔州微波电话和传真也已经营业。一年多来，对苏经贸活动发展迅速，易货贸易签定合同2亿瑞士法郎，30％已履约，进出口品种700多个，贸易伙伴有60多家。
