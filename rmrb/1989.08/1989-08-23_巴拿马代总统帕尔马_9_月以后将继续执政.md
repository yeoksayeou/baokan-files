Panama Acting President Palma announced on August 22 that, given that the talks among the Panamanian military, the ruling party, and the opposition have not yet reached an agreement on the transfer of power, he may continue to serve after his term expires on September 1.

Palma pointed out that his decision is not out of a desire to hold onto the presidency, but to prevent a new political crisis from arising due to a power vacuum at that time.

    巴拿马代总统帕尔马9月以后将继续执政
    巴拿马代总统帕尔马8月22日宣布，鉴于巴拿马军方、执政党和反对党三方对话至今未就政权更迭问题达成协议，他可能在9月1日任职期满以后继续执政。
    帕尔马指出，他做出上述决定并不是因为留恋总统职位，而是为了避免因届时国内无人接掌政权而产生新的政治危机。
