The People's Daily, Hohhot — Correspondent Ào Tēng reports: "The secretary came to our banner to eat the local people's home-cooked buckwheat noodles, stayed in the banner committee's office, and chatted with people during tea breaks and after meals, learning a lot of information..." This is a segment from a letter written by several cadres from Inner Mongolia's Ikh Juu League praising a vice secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee.

According to the staff of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Office, traveling lightly and directly going to the masses is a significant feature of the recent change in the work style of the Autonomous Region Party Committee leaders. Recently, the secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee went to Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia. He immediately went to a Russian ethnic village on the northern border of Ergun Right Banner, which is rarely visited by others, to understand the difficulties in the production and life of the local people. He also went to the inconveniently located Khorchin sandy area, explained the spirit of the 13th Party Congress to the herdsmen, and discussed methods to combat desertification and poverty.

The chairman of the Autonomous Region Government recently led the cadres of the Autonomous Region Party and Government directly affiliated agencies to work with farmers in the suburbs of Hohhot and do good deeds for the people. The chairman of the Standing Committee of the Autonomous Region People's Congress and a vice secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee went to the poorest rural and pastoral areas of Ikh Juu League and Ulanqab League, respectively, to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses and discuss strategies for poverty alleviation and prosperity.

The leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee believed during the study of the documents of the 13th Party Congress that the image of the Party is largely reflected in the words and deeds of our leading cadres. We not only need to understand the masses but also need the masses to understand us. Only when the masses truly understand us will our words have the power to mobilize; only when we understand the masses will our decisions be more in line with the masses' needs and avoid mistakes. Therefore, the leadership of the Autonomous Region Party Committee decided to persist in changing the work style and maintaining contact with the masses, making it a system.

### 要了解群众　也要让群众了解  内蒙古区领导努力转变工作作风

    要了解群众　也要让群众了解
    内蒙古区领导努力转变工作作风
    本报呼和浩特电　记者傲腾报道：“书记来我旗吃当地老百姓的家常便饭荞麦面条，住在旗委办公室，他茶余饭后和人们聊天，了解了很多情况……”这是内蒙古伊克昭盟的几名干部写信表扬区党委一位副书记的一段话。
    据区党委办公厅的工作人员介绍说，下乡轻车简从，直接到群众中去，这是自治区党委领导最近改变作风的一大特点。自治区党委书记最近到内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟下乡，一下子就扎到平时很少有人问津的北部边境上的额尔古纳右旗的一个俄罗斯民族聚居村里，了解当地群众生产生活中的困难。他还来到交通不便的科尔沁沙窝子里，向牧民宣讲党的十三届四中全会精神，和他们商量治沙治穷之法。
    自治区政府主席最近两次带领自治区党政直属机关干部到呼和浩特市郊区和农民一起劳动，为老百姓办好事。自治区人大常委会主任和自治区党委一位副书记，分别下乡到伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟最贫困的农村牧区，和群众促膝谈心，共商治穷致富之策。
    内蒙古自治区党委领导班子在学习党的十三届四中全会文件时认为，党的形象很大程度上体现在我们领导干部的一言一行上。我们不仅要了解群众，也要让群众了解我们。群众真正了解了我们，我们说话才有号召力；我们了解了群众，决策才能更切合群众要求，避免失误。为此，自治区党委一班人决定把改变作风、联系群众的做法坚持下去，使其制度化。
