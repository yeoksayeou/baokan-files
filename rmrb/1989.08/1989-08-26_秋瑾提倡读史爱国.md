Qiu Jin was a famous figure in modern Chinese history, known as the "Jianhu Female Knight." During her time studying in Japan, she received a letter from her nephew, Qiu Rulin, who was from her hometown of Shaoxing. In the letter, Rulin mentioned that he had been admitted to a foreign language school and would soon start his studies. Upon reading the letter, Qiu Jin noticed that the language was not fluent and contained several errors. She immediately wrote back to her nephew, advising him, "Even if you are studying in a foreign language school, you should still be proficient in Chinese. It is unreasonable to abandon Chinese and focus solely on English." She further explained, "One must have a love for their country. If one does not understand their own country's language and history, they cannot develop a love for their country."

Qiu Jin advocated for reading history and loving the country, and she herself practiced what she preached. From a young age, she was deeply influenced by her family's scholarly traditions and had a particular fondness for historical books. She admired the patriotic figures in "Records of the Grand Historian" and was deeply moved by the patriotic thoughts in the poetry of Du Fu and Xin Qiji. She respected historical female heroes like Hua Mulan and Qin Liangyu, and aspired to learn from them. During her teenage years, Qiu Jin wrote a poem to express her aspirations:

	Meat-eating officials are all vegetarians,
	Faithful service to the country relies on red-faced women;
	What a heroine, discussing military affairs,
	Like Hua Mulan in the old days, standing on equal footing.

    秋瑾提倡读史爱国
    秋瑾是我国近代史上一位著名人物，人称“鉴湖女侠”。她在日本留学期间，收到她的侄子秋壬林从故乡绍兴寄来的一封信。壬林在信中说，自己已考上洋学堂，将去读书云云。秋瑾见信中文词欠通且有错别字，便立即给那位侄儿回信，谆谆告诫他：“虽入学堂，中文亦宜通达，断无丢失中文，专学英文之理。”并严肃地阐明了道理：“但凡爱国之心，人不可不有。若不知本国文字、历史，即不能生爱国心也。”
    秋瑾劝人读史爱国，自己更是身体力行。她幼承家学，尤爱阅读史书。她读《史记》，慕书中爱国人物之为人；她喜爱诗词，吟诵杜甫、辛弃疾等人的诗集，深受他们爱国思想的感染；她尊敬历史上的巾帼英雄花木兰、秦良玉，立志向她们学习。少女时代的秋瑾就曾作诗以明志：
    肉食朝臣尽素食，精忠报国赖红颜；
    壮哉奇女谈军事，鼎足当年花木兰。
