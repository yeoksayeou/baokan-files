The prolonged "wool war" in Inner Mongolia, which lasted for four years, has now subsided. The market order for wool and cashmere has improved, and prices have stabilized. According to quality inspection reports, the quality of wool and cashmere purchased this year in the autonomous region has returned to its historical highest level.

Inner Mongolia's sheep wool and cashmere production accounts for one-fourth and one-half of the national total, respectively. The wool and cashmere products from this region have always been in high demand in the international market, earning the region over $100 million in foreign exchange annually. The international market has praised these products as "fibrous gems." Due to the supply-demand contradictions in both domestic and international markets and the competition for interests among regions, the "wool war" and "cashmere war" have flared up intermittently. In particular, in 1988, multiple buyers from coastal regions and neighboring provinces drove the "wool war" and "cashmere war" to a peak, causing prices to soar and the mixing of inferior products to worsen. The comprehensive cleaning rate of wool dropped from 30% to around 20%, and the yield of dehaired cashmere fell from 40% to 23%. Thousands of tons of sand and impurities flowed into enterprises along with the wool and cashmere, causing significant losses to the state. To fundamentally reverse this chaotic situation, the autonomous region government began comprehensive regulation and rectification of the wool and cashmere market from the second half of last year, using administrative, economic, and legal measures.

Last year, various levels of industrial and commercial departments in the autonomous region investigated and handled over 150 major cases of illegal wool and cashmere trading, seizing 523 tons of wool and 34 tons of cashmere worth tens of millions of yuan. Among these, the main cashmere-producing area, Yikezhao League, handled 34 cases involving over 100,000 yuan each. The autonomous region government also formulated the 1989 wool and cashmere purchasing and sales management system and methods, deciding to implement specialized wool and cashmere operations starting this year. The base-level supply and marketing cooperatives will be responsible for unified purchasing, and the county-level livestock product companies will handle operations. The policy of pricing based on quality will be strictly adhered to, and price increases or decreases through level adjustments or other means will not be allowed.

To ensure the quality of wool and cashmere purchasing this year, the autonomous region government has formulated a series of quality supervision measures. First, national quality standards will be strictly enforced, and wool and cashmere purchasing personnel must obtain technical qualification certificates from fiber inspection departments before engaging in purchasing work. Uninspected wool and cashmere will not be allowed for trading. Second, all second-level stations and counties producing over 500,000 kilograms of wool annually, as well as regions and enterprises implementing direct transactions between herders and factories, will implement net wool pricing and sales. Third, specialized wool markets will be established to promote open trading and fair competition, standardizing market behavior. Fourth, cashmere combing factories will be subject to a licensing system to control the blind expansion of processing enterprises.

    采取行政经济法律手段综合治理
    内蒙古“羊毛大战”告停
    今年收购秩序好、价格稳、质量高
    新华社呼和浩特8月11日电（记者魏友林）经过治理整顿，内蒙古持续4年的“羊毛大战”已经平息。如今绒毛市场秩序良好，价格平稳。据质量部门的检查报告，自治区今年收购的绒毛质量已恢复到历史最高水平。
    内蒙古的绵羊毛和山羊绒产量分别占全国的1／4和1／2，这里产的无毛绒及其制品一直是国际市场的抢手货，年出口创汇达1亿美元，被国际市场誉为“纤维宝石”。由于近几年国内外市场的供需矛盾和地区间的利益竞争，“羊毛大战”时起时伏。特别是1988年沿海地区和毗邻省区的多头抢购，把“羊毛大战”、“羊绒大战”推向高峰，造成价格暴涨，掺杂使假愈演愈烈。羊毛的综合洗净率由30％下降到20％左右，无毛绒的出成率由40％降到23％，数以千吨计的沙土和杂物随着羊毛、羊绒流进企业，给国家造成重大损失。为了从根本上扭转这种混乱局面，自治区政府从去年下半年开始，采取了行政、经济、法律等手段综合治理整顿绒毛市场。
    自治区各级工商部门去年查处各种违法倒卖绒毛的大案要案150多起，查获羊毛523吨，羊绒34吨，价值数千万元。其中山羊绒主产区伊克昭盟，查处万元以上大案34起。自治区政府还制定了1989年绒毛购销经营新体制和管理办法，决定今年起实行绒毛专营，由基层供销社统一收购，旗县以上畜产公司经营；坚持按质论价，不许抬级抬价、变相加价或压级压价。
    自治区政府为确保今年绒毛收购质量，制定了一系列质量监督措施。一是严格执行国家质量标准，绒毛收购人员必须获得纤维检验部门颁发的技术合格证书方可从事收购工作。未经检验的绒毛不得进行交易。二是所有二级站、年产羊毛50万公斤以上的旗县实行工牧直接交易的地区和企业，一律实行净毛计价销售。三是建立羊毛专业市场，实行公开交易，公平竞争，以规范市场行为。四是对羊绒分梳厂实行许可证制度，控制加工企业盲目发展。
