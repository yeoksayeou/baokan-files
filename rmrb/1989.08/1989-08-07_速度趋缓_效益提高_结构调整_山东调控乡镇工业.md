Shandong Province has been focusing on rectification and restructuring, continuously strengthening the macro-control and guidance of township industries. Although the development speed has slowed down, economic efficiency has improved.

In the first half of this year, Shandong Province's township industries completed a production value of 2.527 billion yuan, with a growth rate 14.3 percentage points lower than the same period last year. Meanwhile, sales revenue increased by 38.4%, total profits and taxes increased by 25.1%, and the turnover of current funds accelerated by 15 days.

Through rectification and restructuring, the structure of township industries has developed in a more rational direction. This year, new investments in Shandong's township industries have significantly decreased, with the investment amount reduced from 3.13 billion yuan last year to 1.8 billion yuan. Out of the 2,605 projects carried over from last year, 655 were scaled down, and 617 were postponed, totaling 48.8% of the carried-over projects, relatively reducing the capital investment by 8.5 billion yuan. Through internal structural adjustments, the effective development of key industries such as agricultural and sideline product processing, building materials, and agricultural machinery, as well as famous, special, excellent, new, and export-earning products, has been ensured.

    山东调控乡镇工业
    本报讯  山东省以治理整顿为中心，不断加强对乡镇工业的宏观调控和指导，虽然其发展速度放慢了一些，而经济效益提高。
    今年上半年，山东省乡镇工业完成产值252.7亿元，增幅较去年同期下降14.3个百分点。同时，销售收入增长38.4％，利税总额增长25.1％，定额流动资金周转加快15天。
    通过治理整顿，乡镇工业结构向合理方向发展。今年，山东乡镇工业新增投入明显减少，投入额由去年的31.3亿元减少到18亿元。去年结转过来的2605个项目，压缩了655个，缓建了617个，两项合计占结转项目的48.8％，相对减少资金投入8.5亿元。通过内部结构调整，有效保证了乡镇农副产品加工、建材、农机等骨干行业和名、特、优、新、出口创汇产品的较快发展。
