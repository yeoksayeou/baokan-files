Title: A Night

Just after starting university, before we even found our classrooms, we were sent to this remote mountain area for military training. There were so many mosquitoes, and we had to sleep on hard boards... we accepted all that, but what we couldn't stand was the way the soldiers training us seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for us: on Saturday afternoons, when we were supposed to be resting, as soon as someone lay down, the platoon leader would give the order, and a whistle would send us all out for training; these days, with the typhoon and heavy rain, we still had to go through inspections and shooting practice, in the wind and rain, with no one showing any concern for us.

That night, it was our class's turn to stand guard. Everyone started complaining: "It's raining so hard, who would come as an enemy?" "We should just go through the motions."

Suddenly, an assembly whistle sounded at the door. We found out that the platoon leader, squad leader, and class leader had been called to an emergency meeting to go to the flood relief effort, and they wouldn't be back tonight. Not coming back? The tiger was gone, and the monkeys were jumping for joy. We hugged each other in excitement.

When would they return? We didn't know. Where did they go? We didn't know. How could they just leave like that? What do you mean "just leave"? Soldiers have to obey orders unconditionally.

With the sound of rolling wheels, the real soldiers of the entire company disappeared into the night.

Everything returned to calm.

We also regained our calm, but within that calm was worry and fear: they really just left like that? Tonight, it was our turn to stand guard. Now that we think about it, this stormy night is the perfect time for bad people to strike. We had to protect the armory, the company headquarters, and most importantly, the safety of over 90 "female soldiers"! What a heavy burden! If they were to... but they went to the flood relief effort, "flood relief," what a dangerous word. I hope nothing happens to them. If something were to happen, oh, it's too scary to even think about. The cruelty depicted in movies is so close to us today! This is what it means to be a soldier, a sacred, dangerous profession that is always ready to sacrifice.

They left, carrying their sacred mission. What should we do? In that moment, everyone suddenly grew up, became more mature. We calmly and carefully discussed: we must stand this night watch, take care of ourselves, and as long as we are here, we must ensure the safety of the entire company. We must check the armory more often, go to the kitchen early in the morning to help with cooking, most of the students don't know about the flood relief effort, if they find out, will they follow the rules? It seems we have to say that tonight the brigade will have an inspection, and all classes must turn off the lights and go to sleep on time, no one is allowed to move around... We discussed and gestured excitedly, our eyes burning with a fierce light, as if a fierce battle was about to begin. Aren't we also becoming real soldiers, real military personnel?

The lights-out bell rang, and we walked to our posts fully equipped. The rain beat against the umbrella like drumbeats, in front of us was the misty field under the dim lights, the accumulated water from the days of rain reflected the lights, the path under our feet was muddy, and with every step, it felt like we might slip. We shone our flashlights, tensely looking around. The company was stationed on the mountain, surrounded by tall, dark trees. A cold, bone-chilling wind blew, and I couldn't help but shiver: what a terrifying night! The most terrifying thing is that we have no one to rely on. Usually, we only know how to complain, but today we realize we are carrying such a heavy burden. And we, eighty or ninety young girls, even if we combine our strength, it is still so weak. But as long as we think that we few, with our equally weak bodies, are protecting the company, protecting all our comrades, we can't help but straighten our backs and continue patrolling in the wind and rain. In the morning, we rushed to the kitchen to make breakfast, only to find out that the entire company had returned on foot during the night. We let out a long sigh of relief.

After changing shifts, I fell asleep as soon as I hit the bed... a whistle woke me from my dreams, but my mind was still foggy. I got up, rubbed my eyes, and looked out the window: the soldiers had already assembled, waiting for us to do morning exercises together. A neat row of green walls, each one spirited and vibrant, as if nothing had happened last night.

My eyes were a bit teary, with respect, shame, and pride.

    一夜
    兰凝
    刚进大学，连教室都没找着，就被拉到这偏远的山区军训。多蚊，睡硬床板……这些我们都认了，更叫人吃不消的是训练我们的解放军，有时候简直就是专门和我们过不去：星期六下午明明是休息时间，刚有人躺下，连长就发了令，一阵哨就把我们全轰出去训练；这几天台风暴雨闹个不停，依旧是考核、射击，风里雨里，也没人心疼我们。
    晚上该我们班站岗，大家一起发牢骚：“暴雨天嘛，哪里会有敌人来？”“敷衍过去算了。”
    突然，一声集合哨在门口响起，一打听，原来是连长排长班长紧急集合去抗洪救灾，今晚不回来了。不回来了？老虎走了猴子跳，我们高兴得互相拥抱起来。
    那什么时候回来呢？不知道。到哪儿去？不知道。怎么糊里糊涂就走？什么糊里糊涂，军人，就是要坚决服从命令。
    随着一阵滚滚的车轮声，全连真正的军人就杳然不知所之了。
    一切都恢复了平静。
    我们也恢复了平静，平静中是忧虑和恐惧：真的就这样走了？这一夜，可是我们值班啊，现在想来，这暴雨的天才是坏人出没的好机会，我们得保卫军械库、连部，更重要的是90多位“女兵”的安全啊！这是一副多么重的担子！假如他们在……可他们抗洪救灾去了，“抗洪救灾”，多么危险的词儿，该不会出什么意外吧？万一，哎，真是想都不敢想，电影里描绘的残酷，在今天与我们是多么接近啊！这就是军人啊，神圣的危险的随时准备献身的职业。
    他们走了，带着神圣的使命，我们该怎么办？这一霎那，大家突然都长大了，懂事了，我们镇定而又仔细地商量着：站好这夜岗，自己管好自己，只要我们在，就要保证整个连队的安全。军械库要多察看，明早要去厨房帮着做饭，大多数同学还不知道抗洪的事，假如她们知道了，会不会不太遵守纪律？看来，只好说今夜团里要评比检查，各班务必准时熄灯睡觉，不准四处走动……我们激动地讨论着、比划着，眼里放着灼热的光，仿佛一场恶战近在眼前似的。我们不也正在成为真正的战士，真正的军人吗？
    熄灯铃响了，我们全副武装地走上了岗位。雨鼓点似地打在伞面上，前方是阴暗灯光下雾蒙蒙的操场，多日来暴雨留下的积水反射着灯光，脚下的路泥泞不堪，踩上去一深一浅，总像要滑倒。我们打着手电筒，紧张地环视着。连队驻扎在山上，四周都是黑压压的大树，冷冷地一阵刺骨阴风吹来，我不禁打了一个寒颤：多么可怕的夜啊！最可怕的是没有了依靠，平日里只知道抱怨，今儿才知道我们肩负着这样重的担子。而我们，八九十个小姑娘，哪怕全加在一起，力量也是多么薄弱啊。但只要一想到我们几个用自己同样弱小的身体保卫着连队、保卫着全连的战友，又不禁挺直了腰，冒着狂风暴雨继续巡逻。清晨，我们赶到厨房做早饭，才知道全连指战员都连夜徒步回来了，我们长长地吐了一口气。
    换了班我倒床便睡……一阵哨声把我从梦中惊醒，可脑子是昏沉沉的。我爬起来揉揉眼睛向窗外望去：战士们已经集合好，在等我们一起早操了，整齐的一排绿色城墙，个个精神抖擞的，仿佛昨夜一切都不曾发生。
    我的眼睛都有些潮了，有崇敬，有自愧，也有自豪。
