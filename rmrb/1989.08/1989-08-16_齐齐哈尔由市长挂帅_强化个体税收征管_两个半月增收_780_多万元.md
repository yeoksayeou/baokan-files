	Qiqihar has, since May this year, been led by the mayor in strengthening the management of individual tax collection. Various departments have collaborated closely, and in two and a half months, an additional 780 million yuan in taxes has been collected. Among these, personal income adjustment tax and individual industrial and commercial tax have increased by 10 times and 50 percent respectively compared to the same period last year.

	Qiqihar has long been a leading city in tax collection work in Heilongjiang Province. This May, the municipal government seized the opportunity presented by the rectification and adjustment efforts, with the mayor personally directing the strengthening of individual tax collection work. The people's governments of various counties and districts, as well as the municipal and county district tax, industrial and commercial, public security, and banking departments, worked closely together in a coordinated effort. They used various methods such as issuing announcements, setting up supervision and propaganda stations to promote tax declaration and supplementary reporting. In two months, 3,028 individuals voluntarily declared and paid personal income adjustment tax, and 21,725 individual industrial and commercial households voluntarily supplemented their tax reports for evaded taxes. Over a hundred tax evaders and resistors received strict punishments.
