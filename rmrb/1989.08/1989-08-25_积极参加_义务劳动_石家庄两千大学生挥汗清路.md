In the morning of the 24th, laughter and songs filled the streets on both sides of Liberation Road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. Over 2,000 students from five universities were energetically working, shoveling and digging. Passersby frequently cast approving glances.

To welcome the National Day with a clean city, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Communist Youth League initiated this volunteer labor activity, which received a positive response from the student unions and a wide range of students. Vice Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Lyu Chuanzan, and Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee, Li Haifeng, joined the students in the labor. After four hours of work, nearly 100 tons of garbage were transported away, and over 6,000 meters of flower beds were cleaned. A reporter asked a female student who was wiping her sweat for her thoughts. She spoke enthusiastically: "The most important thing is that the sweat from labor can wash away the dust in our minds."

    积极参加“义务劳动”
    石家庄两千大学生挥汗清路
    本报石家庄8月25日电  记者陈国琦报道：24日上午，河北省石家庄市解放路两侧，笑语欢歌。来自5所大学的2000多名大学生挥锨舞镐，紧张地劳动着。过往行人不时投来赞许的目光。
    为了干干净净迎国庆，石家庄团市委倡议组织这次义务劳动，得到各校团组织和广大学生的响应。省委副书记吕传赞、石家庄市委书记李海峰与大学生一同参加了劳动。经过4个钟头的劳动，装运垃圾近百吨，清理花坛6000多米。记者请一位正在擦汗的女同学谈谈感想，她快语直言：重要的是，劳动的汗水能荡涤思想上的灰尘。
