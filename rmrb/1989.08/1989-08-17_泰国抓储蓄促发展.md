Thailand's domestic funds for industrial development primarily come from savings. In recent years, the government has implemented various measures to encourage citizens to save.

Firstly, the government has abolished the maximum interest rate limit for deposits, promoting free competition among commercial banks. Previously, banks could only compete within the government's regulated limits. On June 1st, the government announced the removal of the maximum interest rate limit for fixed-term deposits of one year or more, providing commercial banks with greater competitive space and attracting more long-term depositors. Meanwhile, to encourage entrepreneurs to invest using domestic funds, the government has retained the maximum interest rate limit for loans.

Secondly, the government supports commercial banks in expanding their services to better serve the public. The government supports commercial banks in increasing deposit interest rates while adopting more flexible methods to attract deposits. The main measures taken by commercial banks include: establishing more branches. The 15 commercial banks in the country have all expanded their branches, increasing the total number from 1,184 in 1977 to the current 2,089; visiting customers at home. Previously, banks often waited for customers to come to them, but now they send staff to visit customers at home to encourage them to save; giving away gifts. During festivals and year-end, banks give customers gifts such as calendars, lamps, handbags, and suitcases; installing computers. Banks have added computer storage devices to facilitate communication between the head office and branches, and between branches, allowing customers to deposit and withdraw money at any branch nationwide. In many public places, automatic teller machines are also set up, enabling customers to deposit and withdraw money outside of banking hours; using credit cards. This greatly facilitates customers.

Thirdly, developing small banks in rural areas. The government emphasizes the development of small banks with only 3 to 5 employees in rural areas to accumulate funds in rural areas and facilitate government loans to rural areas, supporting agriculture and rural industries.

Fourthly, guiding the people to form the habit of saving. The government and financial institutions emphasize the promotion of the benefits of saving, making the public aware of saving as soon as they have money. The reporter found that many Thai colleagues deposit their salaries in the bank as soon as they receive them. They say, "The earlier you save, the more interest you earn. Not saving money is a waste, and saving money is beneficial for both individuals and the country."

Due to the implementation of the above measures, Thailand's domestic funds have significantly increased. In the first half of this year, the total funds of commercial banks alone increased by nearly 20% compared to the past. According to financial experts, since the abolition of the maximum interest rate limit for long-term deposits on June 1st, the deposit amount has also seen a new increase.

    泰国抓储蓄促发展
    本报记者　刘爱成
    泰国发展工业的国内资金主要来自储蓄。近年来政府采取了各种鼓励国民存款的措施。
    首先是取消最高存款利率限额，促使各商业银行自由竞争。过去只能在政府规定的限额内进行竞争。今年6月1日，政府宣布取消定期存款一年以上的最高利率限额，为各商业银行提供了更大竞争余地，使长期存款客户不断增多。同时，政府为了鼓励企业家利用国内资金投资，仍然保留了贷款利率的最高限额。其次支持商业银行扩大业务，方便群众。政府支持商业银行在提高存款利息的同时，采取更多更灵活的方式吸收存款。各商业银行采取的办法主要是：增设分行。全国15个商业银行均在各地增设分行，使分行总数从1977年的1184个增加到目前的2089个；上门找客户。过去往往是等客上门，现在则多改为派人分头登门拜访找客户，劝其存款；赠送礼品。在节日和年终，各银行都对客户赠送年历、台灯、手提包、手提箱等礼品或纪念品；设置电脑，各银行都添置了电脑储存设备，沟通总行与分行及分行之间的联系，这样客户在任何一家分行存款，都可以在全国各分行取款，在许多公共场所，还设置自动存取款机，使客户在银行营业时间外照样可以存取款；使用信用卡。这极大地方便了客户。
    第三，在农村发展小银行。政府特别强调要在农村发展只有3至5名工作人员的小银行，以利于积累农村的资金，同时也有利于政府向农村发放贷款，支持农业及乡村工业。
    第四，引导人民养成存款习惯，政府和金融机构重视宣传存款的好处，使群众做到有钱就存。记者发现许多泰国同行发了工资首先上银行存款，他们说，“早存一天就多一天的利息，有钱不存是浪费，存钱对个人和国家都有利。”
    由于采取了上述措施，泰国国内资金的积累大大增加。今年上半年，仅商业银行的总资金就比过去增长近20％。据金融界人士估计，自6月1日取消长期存款最高利率限额之后，存款额又有了新的增加。
