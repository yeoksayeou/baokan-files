Hubei Shuts Down a Batch of Township Enterprises

	This Year Has Basically Not Laid Out New Stalls

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on August 5 (reporter Shi Yongfeng), Hubei Province is vigorously reducing township enterprises that compete with large-scale industries for energy and raw materials.

	By the end of July, the province had shut down more than 5,600 such township enterprises. Additionally, it has halted operations of more than 20,000 small individual and joint ventures that are energy-intensive, low-efficiency, and environmentally polluting.

	At the same time, Hubei Province has strictly controlled the establishment of new township enterprises, and this year has basically not laid out new stalls.

	The closure of a large number of low-level, high-waste township enterprises has ensured the production factors for more than 590 key and export-earning township enterprises and more than 770 famous and high-quality products within the province.

    湖北关闭一批乡镇企业
    今年基本未铺新摊子
    据新华社武汉8月5日电　（记者施勇峰）湖北省大力压缩与大工业争能源、原材料的乡镇企业。
    到7月底，全省共关闭这类乡镇企业5600多家，并关停了2万多个耗能高、效益差、污染环境的个体和联办的小企业。
    同时，湖北省还从严控制乡镇企业上马，今年以来基本没有铺新摊子。
    一大批低水平、高浪费的乡镇企业的关闭，使省内590多个重点和出口创汇乡镇企业、770多个名优产品的生产要素得到保证。
