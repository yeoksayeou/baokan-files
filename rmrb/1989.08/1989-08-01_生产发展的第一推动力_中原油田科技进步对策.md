If closed-off rural life makes it difficult for people to enjoy the benefits of modern science and technology, then opening up to the outside world provides a good opportunity for technological progress in the Zhongyuan Oilfield. In recent years, advanced technologies from developed countries in areas such as seismic exploration, development, well logging, and drilling mud have been successively introduced to Zhongyuan, becoming a powerful lever for the production development of this oilfield, which is located at the junction of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces and is the fourth-largest oilfield in the country.

Focusing on the High Ground of New Technologies for Introduction

The director of the Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, Jin Yuxian, put it well: The development of productive forces is a gradual process that accumulates over time and is difficult to leapfrog. However, technology can, under certain conditions, jump from a lower level directly to a higher level. Moreover, learning an advanced technology is much easier and faster than researching and developing one. Japan's rapid advancement to world-class standards after World War II was partly due to its implementation of an "introduction strategy." From 1950 to 1977, Japan spent only $8 billion to introduce 30,000 new technologies, thereby obtaining research results that Western countries had achieved with $200 billion and 80 years of effort.

In the process of introducing foreign advanced technologies, the Zhongyuan Oilfield has been very selective. The secretary of the Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau Party Committee, Lin Zhi, said: It's like using the same amount of money to build houses—you can either build 500 high-quality ones or 1,000 that collapse the year after they are built. Which would you choose? Of course, you would choose the 500 high-quality ones. We need to focus on the high ground of new technologies in oil and gas exploration and development, introducing the most advanced technologies from the international oil industry to drive the transformation of general technologies, forming a multi-tiered technological structure from high to low.

According to Sun Ruiping, who is in charge of introduction work at the Zhongyuan Oilfield Foreign Affairs Office, the introduction of internationally advanced technologies such as numerical control well logging and repetitive formation testing has significantly improved the data interpretation accuracy of the Zhongyuan Oilfield, where well depths are generally over 3,000 meters, with a matching rate of 81.6%. The introduction of advanced exploration technologies such as 3D seismic and a high-quality drilling mud formula has resulted in a 100% success rate for drilling in the geologically complex Zhongyuan Oilfield. Liu Daichun, manager of the Zhongyuan Downhole Operations Company, revealed after repeated calculations: In 1986, the company introduced the most advanced well repair technologies and equipment from abroad, repairing 33 wells in two years, increasing crude oil production by more than 180,000 tons, and earning a net profit of over 13 million yuan.

Promoting New Technologies to Evaluate Scientific Researchers

The results of the introductions are so obvious, but the comrades of the Zhongyuan Oilfield do not stop at introductions. They believe that the promotion of new technologies is an intermediate link for quickly transforming modern science and technology into direct productive forces and is also a relatively weak link in the current enterprise. The Zhongyuan Well Logging Company took the lead in proposing a "one-stop" approach of "introduction (research and development)—promotion and application—development and operation." For every advanced technology introduced or research achievement made, they promote and apply one, never allowing it to remain in the stages of gifts, samples, or exhibits. A group of senior operators emerged during the promotion and application process. By the beginning of 1986, the Zhongyuan Well Logging Company had become the first numerical control well logging training center in the national petroleum system. The temperature monitoring device they introduced and modified is not only widely used in the oilfield but has also been transferred to sister oilfields for a fee.

The promotion and application of new technologies in an enterprise are often constrained by supporting conditions. In recent years, not only has the Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau been focusing on the coordination of eight technologies, including vertical seismic profiles and 3D seismic exploration, as a major issue related to the technological progress of the entire oilfield, but various factories and departments have also begun to focus on the coordination of their own key projects and critical technologies. For example, the drilling department is working hard to explore the rational design of wellbore structures, the optimization of mud types and performance parameters, and the coordination of well control and cementing technologies, finally overcoming the difficulty of drilling in high-pressure, high-salt oil and gas layers. Since 1986, the drilling speed of the Zhongyuan Oilfield has increased by 18.7% per year, and the cost has decreased by 5.3% per year, reaching the advanced level of the 1980s abroad.

The promotion of new technologies is often constrained by systems and habitual thinking. For example, when evaluating scientific research units and engineering and technical personnel, people often use the number of achievements, the level of appraisal, and the awards received as criteria, but rarely consider the promotion and application of these achievements. With the deepening of the reform, the Zhongyuan Oilfield has begun to use the promotion of new technologies as one of the criteria for evaluating scientific research units and engineering and technical personnel. This move is very effective. Units and individuals responsible for introducing or developing new technologies are no longer considered to have completed their tasks just by holding an acceptance or appraisal meeting. The deputy manager of the Zhongyuan Well Logging Company, Li Mingchun, humorously said: Nowadays, the workload for evaluating new technology promotion awards is getting bigger and bigger! But, we are happy to do this work...

Joining Universities and Research Institutes to Reserve New Technologies

The deputy director of the Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, Che Zhuowu, realized a truth during his long-term management of the oilfield's scientific and technological work: Just like basic science, scientific and technological development also has a reserve problem, a problem of being ahead of production. If the results of basic science often take ten years or more from completion to actual application, then the results of scientific and technological research often take more than five years from completion to actual application. For an ultra-large enterprise like the Zhongyuan Oilfield, with 70,000 employees and more than 10,000 large and medium-sized pieces of equipment, if it does not have its own scientific and technological reserves, it will lose the momentum for scientific and technological progress. A strong scientific and technological force is the source of scientific and technological reserves and progress.

Due to its relatively weak scientific and technological strength, the Zhongyuan Oilfield, while vigorously training and accumulating talent, has paid attention to fully utilizing social forces to implement a scientific and technological reserve plan. According to Jin Yuxian's analysis, many universities, research institutions, and military industries have the advantages of strong strength, knowledge concentration, and wide and accurate information provision. However, due to the current underdeveloped market, the conditions and environment for these units to enter enterprises are not ideal. Adopting a joint development approach can help enterprises borrow social forces to achieve scientific and technological reserves.

Since 1986, the Zhongyuan Oilfield has cooperated with more than 20 universities, research institutions, and more than 10 military industries to begin a three-year scientific and technological breakthrough campaign. By the end of last year, five technologies, including ancient buried hill research and deep well fracturing, had been broken through, and another ten technologies, including reservoir description and numerical simulation, had made significant progress. These are all project reserves for the Zhongyuan Oilfield in future competitions.

    生产发展的第一推动力
    ——中原油田科技进步对策
    本报记者　鹿舫
    如果说封闭的田园生活使人难以享受现代科学技术的恩惠，那么对外开放则为中原油田的科技进步提供了良机。近年来，发达国家的地震勘探、开发、测井、泥浆等先进技术，一一被引进中原，成了这家地处冀鲁豫三省交界处的全国第四大油田生产发展的强有力的杠杆。
    盯住新技术的制高点搞引进
    中原石油勘探局局长金毓荪说得好：生产力发展是一个日积月累的渐进过程，难以逾越。但是，技术在一定条件下可以从较低水平直接跳跃到较高的水平，何况学习一种先进技术比研究开发一种先进技术要容易得多、快得多。日本战后在较短的时间赶上了世界先进水平，原因之一就在于实行“引进战略”。从1950年到1977年，日本仅用了八十亿美元引进来三万项新技术，就得到了西方国家用二千亿美元和八十年时间取得的研究成果。
    在引进国外先进技术的过程中，中原油田非常注意选择。中原石油勘探局党委书记林治开说：好比用同一笔钱盖房，既可盖五百间质量高的，也可盖一千间今年砌明年塌的，你说怎么盖？当然要盖那五百间质量高的。我们的眼睛要盯着油气勘探开发新技术的制高点，把国外石油界最先进的技术引进来，推动一般技术的改造，形成多层次的从高到低的技术层次结构。
    据中原油田外事办公室负责引进工作的孙瑞莹统计，由于引进了数控测井和重复式地层测试等国际上最先进的测井技术，井深普遍在三千米以上的中原油田大大提高了资料解释精度，符合率达81.6％。由于引进了三维地震和一种优质泥浆配方等国外最先进的勘探技术，地质条件极为复杂的中原油田目前钻探成功率达100％。中原井下作业公司经理刘代臣在反复测算后披露：1986年该公司从国外引进了最先进的修井技术和设备，两年修井三十三口，增产原油十八万多吨，获纯利一千三百多万元。以推广新技术的实绩评价科研人员
    引进的效果是这样的明显，但中原油田的同志并不停留在引进上。他们认为新技术推广是使现代科技迅速转化为直接生产力的中间环节，又是本企业目前比较薄弱的环节。中原测井公司率先提出走“引进（研制）——推广应用——开发经营”一条龙的路子，引进一项先进技术或者自己搞成一项科研成果，就推广应用一项，决不让它长期停留在礼品、样品、展品的阶段。一批高级操作工在推广应用中脱颖而出。到1986年初，中原测井公司就成了全国石油系统第一个数控测井培训中心。他们在引进的基础上加以改造的加温巡查装置，不仅在本油田普遍采用，而且向兄弟油田有偿转让。
    新技术在一个企业推广应用，往往受到配套条件的制约。近几年，不仅中原石油勘探局在把垂直地震剖面、三维地震探测等八项技术的衔接作为关系全油田科技进步的大事来抓，而且各厂处也开始注重自身重点项目和关键技术的成龙。像钻井处的同志就在着力探索合理井身结构设计、泥浆类型和性能参数优选以及井控、固井技术的配套，终于攻克了有盐高压油气层的钻井难关。1986年以来，中原油田的钻井速度每年增长18.7％，成本每年下降5.3％，现已达到国外八十年代先进水平。
    新技术推广还往往受到体制和习惯观念的束缚。譬如，在评价科研单位和工程技术人员时，人们常常只用有多少项成果、通过了什么级别的鉴定、得了什么奖励来衡量，而很少考虑这些成果的推广应用情况。随着改革的深入，中原油田开始把推广新技术的实绩作为评价科研单位及工程技术人员的指标之一。这一招很灵。负责引进或研制新技术的单位和个人再也不是验收或鉴定会一开就算完成任务了。中原测井公司副经理李明春风趣地说：眼下新技术推广奖的评定工作量越来越大啦！不过，忙这事，咱乐意……
    加盟高校研究所储备新技术
    中原石油勘探局副局长车卓吾在长期分管油田科技工作的过程中悟出了一个道理：和基础科学一样，科学技术也有一个储备问题，走在生产前面的问题。如果说基础科学的成果从完成到实际应用，常常需要十年或更多的时间，那末科学技术研究的成果从完成到实际应用，往往也需要五年以上的时间。像中原油田这样拥有七万名职工、上万台大中型设备的特大型企业，如果自身没有科技储备，也就失去了科技进步的后劲。而强大的科研技术力量，则是科技储备和科技进步的源泉。
    由于自身的科技力量比较薄弱，中原油田在大力培训、积累人才的同时，注意充分利用社会力量实施科技储备规划。据金毓荪分析，许多高等院校、科研机构、军工部门有力量雄厚、知识密集、提供信息广泛准确等优势。但由于目前市场发育不健全，这些单位进入企业的条件和环境还不理想。采取联合开发的形式，有助于企业借助社会力量实现科技储备。
    从1986年起，中原油田与二十多家高校、科研所以及十多个军工部门合作，开始为期三年的科技攻关会战。到去年底，突破了古潜山研究、深井分层压裂等五项技术，另有油藏描述、数值模拟等十项技术获得重大进展。这些无一不是中原油田在未来竞争中的项目储备。
