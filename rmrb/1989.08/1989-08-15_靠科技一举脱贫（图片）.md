To help farmers escape poverty and achieve prosperity, Dian Guan Township in Xixia County, Henan Province, organized technical experts to scientifically evaluate the entire township's hilly and thin-soiled lands. They discovered that the soil and microclimate were suitable for growing white burley tobacco. After introducing the technology, training agricultural technicians, and compiling teaching materials, successful trial planting was achieved. The practice quickly spread. Currently, the township has become a major production base for white burley tobacco in the province, and farmers have successfully escaped poverty. The image shows Li Hongxuan, a farmer from the township, and his family drying tobacco leaves.
