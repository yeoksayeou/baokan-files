A survey plan that uses public safety perception as the main criterion to comprehensively assess the social security situation and the quality of public security management was recently approved in Beijing and received high praise from experts.

The Public Security Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security began a large-scale public safety perception sampling test in December 1988 in 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. The survey covered 38 questions related to the social security situation, reactions to illegal and criminal activities, and public security management, and sampled 15,000 urban residents. Out of the 14,822 returned questionnaires, respondents generally rated the current social security situation and their personal safety as "average to poor," leaning towards dissatisfaction, and expressed serious concern about social security issues. Regarding their personal safety, respondents answered as follows: 38.4% felt unsafe or somewhat unsafe; 30.4% felt average; 23.1% felt relatively safe; and 7.9% felt safe.

The survey plan, developed based on testing, research, and analysis, will help scientifically assess the security situation, improve macro-control of social security, and make public security decisions more scientific and democratic. The review committee suggested that the survey plan, after further refinement, be included in the overall planning of the public security system.

    综合衡量社会治安状况和公安管理质量
    公众安全感调查方案评审通过
    本报北京讯　一项以公众安全感为主要依据的综合衡量社会治安状况和公安管理质量的调查方案，不久前在京通过评审时受到了专家们的高度评价。
    公安部公共安全研究所从1988年12月起，在全国15个省、市、自治区中开展了一次大规模的公众安全感抽样测试，就社会治安形势、对违法犯罪的反应和公安管理等38个问题，抽测了15000名城镇居民。在收回的14822份调查问卷中，答卷者对我国目前社会治安状况和自身安全感的总的评价是“一般偏下”，偏向于不满意，对社会治安问题表示严重关切。对于自身安全感的回答是：不安全或不太安全的占38.4％；一般的占30.4％；比较安全的占23.1％；安全的占7.9％。
    在测试、研究和分析的基础上形成的调查方案，将有助于科学衡量治安形势，增进对社会治安的宏观调控和公安决策的科学化、民主化。评委会建议，这次评审通过的调查方案待进一步完善之后，列入公安系统整体规划。
