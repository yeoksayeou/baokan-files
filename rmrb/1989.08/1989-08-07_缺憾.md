The gentle rain is affectionate, like silk threads, entangling me and keeping me in these mountains.

"Staying is staying, what's the rush?" the landlord's young daughter said to me, trying to make me feel at ease after we had just gotten past the initial awkwardness. "Staying an extra day won't age you, will it?"

This little girl's beauty lies in her eyes and eyebrows. When she is surprised, she opens her eyes wide and stares at you without blinking; when she smiles, her eyes narrow into two tiny crescents, delicate and charming. A kind of pure elegance makes you want to praise her, but you find that all those beautiful words are utterly false.

She is a lovable little girl with an ordinary name: Xiangxiang.

After dinner, the small oil lamp was lit, casting a warm yellow glow that soothed my restless heart.

Xiangxiang could see that I was anxious, her expressions gave her away. Suddenly, she wanted to show me something, not waiting for my response, she dashed into the house. When she came out, she was holding a beautifully bound diary. As I reached out to take it, she pulled it back, playfully hiding it behind her back: "Guess."

A child's game. I smiled: "I already saw it."

She pursed her little mouth, looking mischievous: "Guess. If you can't guess… if you can't guess…"

"If you can't guess, I'll tell a story." I continued.

Xiangxiang laughed, her narrowed eyes full of liveliness and sweetness; but she didn't let me guess, instead, she handed it to me and opened it: a stamp collection.

"Whose is it?" I was surprised.

"A half is my dad's, a half is mine."

During the day, while chatting with Xiangxiang's mother, I learned that Xiangxiang's father was originally a village teacher here. During the Cultural Revolution, he became disabled and passed away two years ago. This stamp collection must hold so much bittersweet stories. I felt the weight in my hands.

I flipped through it page by page, appreciating the beauty within the small space: there were stamps from the First Five-Year Plan, Mei Lanfang, and various stamps of fish, insects, flowers, and birds from the 1950s and 1960s. Each stamp was like a small scene flashing by, piecing together fragments of a colorful history. I also love collecting stamps. Often, in my spare time, I would enjoy them alone, gaining unique insights. It's not just about the artistic beauty, but more about the memories of the times and the experiences of life; in the bitterness and sweetness, there is a longing for time and a cherishing of life.

I particularly liked a set of chrysanthemum stamps, but unfortunately, the third one was missing, leaving a small gap; that must also be a regret in Xiangxiang's father's life! After I finished looking at the dozens of sets of stamps that Xiangxiang's father had painstakingly collected, I found that only one was missing. Just one stamp, enough to make an ordinary person search for it all their life, and even in death, it couldn't be compensated, unintentionally leaving this regret to the child. Xiangxiang was frowning, with a hint of sadness in her heart.

I said I had a complete set, and as soon as I said it, I regretted it.

Xiangxiang relaxed her brows and then furrowed them again: "How can I take yours?"

"I promised, said I would give it, I'll send it to you when I go back." I finally said generously. To comfort the child?

Xiangxiang didn't say she wanted it, nor did she say she didn't want it, she became shy. I held her cold little hand, continuing to appreciate her very few stamps. Although there were few, for a mountain girl, it was already a great achievement.

The next day, when I left, Xiangxiang didn't come to see me off. Her mother said the child was foolish, crying in the house for some reason. I was again engulfed in the noisy whirlwind of the city, busy and tired, occasionally remembering the stamp I promised the child, my heart tightened. Xiangxiang must be sincerely waiting in the mountains every day. She must be.

When I took out that stamp, I suddenly hesitated, laughing at my seriousness. Couldn't bear to part with it? In an instant of self-struggle, I found many lies to deceive the child. I wrote a warm and enthusiastic letter, sending the lie to the mountains, asking her to forgive me. The letter was sent, but the distressing mood couldn't be sent away, it couldn't be freed, pressing heavily on my heart.

Half a month later, a letter was placed on my desk. I was timid and didn't dare to open it. I was afraid that the little girl would be inside, smiling with her beautiful eyes.

The letter was written by Xiangxiang's mother, asking not to send the stamp anymore, saying that Xiangxiang had lost her sight in a serious illness...

This sudden news completely knocked me down. I didn't want to be excited, nor did I want to shed tears of sorrow; now I could completely forgive myself: my selfishness, narrow-mindedness, ugliness, and guilt towards a child! This imperfection, this deep imperfection, could a small stamp compensate for it? This imperfection would leave a blank in my life forever.

I really want to go see her.

    缺憾
    峻峰
    小雨多情，如丝如缕的缠绵，竟把我留在这山里了。
    “留下就留下呗，看把你急得哟，多呆一天就把人呆老了么？”房东的小女儿与我刚解除陌生，她说这话是想留我。
    这小女孩长得好看全在眉眼上，她惊奇的时候把眼睛睁得大大的，使劲盯你不眨眼；笑的时候一下就眯成了两弯小缝，精致而迷人；一种纯雅之美让你想夸她，却又发现那些美丽的词儿全都虚假得彻底。
    她是一个可爱的小女孩，名字普通：香香。
    晚饭后，小油灯点亮了，黄黄的光给我焦躁的心以温馨。
    香香怕我急，能看出来，她的表情藏不住。突然就想到要找样东西给我看，不等我答一声就跑到屋里。出来时，手里拿着个精装的日记本。我刚要接，她又缩回去，乖巧地藏在背后：“猜”。
    孩子的方式。我笑了：“我都看见了”。
    她抿着小嘴，淘气的样子：“猜。猜不着……猜不着……”
      “猜不着讲故事。”我接了说。
    香香笑了，眯着的眼又生动又甜蜜；而她并不让我猜，递给我，打开：一本邮集。
      “谁的？”我很惊奇。
      “一半是俺爹的，一半是我自个儿的。”
    白天和香香妈唠话时，知道香香爸原是这里的山村教师，“文革”中下身致残，前年去世了。这本邮集，藏了多少辛酸和美好的故事呢？我感到手上沉沉的。
    我一页一页地翻看，领略方寸之间美的景观：有第一个五年计划的，有梅兰芳，有五六十年代发行的各种鱼、虫、花、鸟。一枚枚如一个个小小的镜头闪过，组接成历史缤纷的片断。我也爱集邮，每每闲暇独自欣赏，独有所得，不尽是艺术美的享受，更多的是对世事的回忆和对人生的体验；在苦涩与甜蜜中生出对时光的眷恋和对生命的珍惜。
    有一组菊花邮票我最喜爱，可惜在第三枚处是个空白，留下小小的空缺；那也是香香爸一生中的缺憾吧！当我看完香香爸苦心搜集的几十套邮票后，发现只缺那一枚。仅只一枚啊，便让一个普通人终身寻觅，至死也没有得以弥补，并无意又将这缺憾留给了孩子。香香正拧着眉，有淡淡忧伤在心上。
    我说我有一套全的，说出我就有些后悔了。
    香香松了眉又拧起：“俺咋能要你的呢”。
      “叔叔答应了，说给就给，回去我给你寄。”我终于还是说了慷慨话。哄哄孩子么？
    香香没说要，也没说不要，羞涩起来。我拉了她凉凉的小手握着，接着欣赏她的那很少的一半。虽说很少，但对于一个山里的孩子已经是很伟大的作为了。
    第二天走时，香香没来送我。她妈说小孩子不懂事，不知咋了在屋里抹泪。我重又陷入都市嘈杂喧嚣的漩涡，匆忙而疲劳，偶然想起我应允孩子的邮票，心便紧得慌。香香一定每日都在山中真诚地等着吧。一定的。
    我取出那张邮票时，突然犹豫了，笑我的认真。舍不得么？一瞬间的自我搏斗，便找了许多可以瞒哄孩子的谎言。写了一封热情洋溢的信，将谎言寄往山里，要她原谅。信寄走了，困扰我的情绪寄不走，不能解脱，沉压着我的心。
    半个月后，一封回信放在我的桌上，我怯怯不敢去拆，我怕那个小女孩就装在里面，会笑眯眯地钻出来，笑着她那好看的眉眼。
    信是香香妈请人代写的，说那邮票不要再寄了，香香的眼睛在一次大病中失明了……
    这突如其来的消息将惶惶的我彻底击倒，我不想有所激动，也不想伤感地流泪；这下完全可以原谅了：我的对一个孩子的自私、狭隘、丑陋和罪过！这缺憾，这深深的缺憾，是一枚小小的邮票可以弥补的吗？这缺憾，将给我终生留下生命的空白。
    我真想去看看她。
