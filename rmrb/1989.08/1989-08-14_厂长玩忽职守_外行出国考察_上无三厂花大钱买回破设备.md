Shanghai No. 3 Radio Factory's former director, Sun Dazhen, and others neglected their duties, spending $204 million to purchase a set of second-hand stereo record player heads that cannot function normally. Although Sun Dazhen was dismissed for incompetence, the batch of old machines he bought are still wrapped in plastic and "sleeping" in the workshop.

Shanghai No. 3 Radio Factory decided to import second-hand stereo record player heads to produce stereo record player heads compatible with tape recorders. Due to the irresponsibility of the project leader and former director, Sun Dazhen, out of the five members sent to inspect BSR Company in the UK and BSR Subsidiary in the US in April 1986, not a single member was a stereo expert. Their knowledge of stereo record players was hastily "imparted" by a university teacher just before the inspection. At the US BSR Subsidiary, the dust-covered old equipment was piled up in disorder in the warehouse and could not be operated at all. This situation violated the regulation that "when importing second-hand equipment, the production process and product quality must be inspected before dismantling and shipping can be supervised." However, the inspection team only made a general request for renovation and approved it.

The foreign party is also responsible for many problems in this equipment import, but the domestic project leader did not pursue the matter in a timely manner. For example, the delivery time was not met, equipment data and key spare parts were not provided as per the contract, and the equipment that was supposed to be renovated was not renovated. In particular, two key pieces of equipment, after repeated repairs and adjustments for half a year, still could not operate normally. Sun Dazhen still found it difficult to ask the foreign party for a refund or compensation.

    厂长玩忽职守　外行出国考察
    上无三厂花大钱买回破设备
    据新华社上海8月14日电　（记者陈继明）上海无线电三厂原厂长孙大振等玩忽职守，花204万美元买回一套无法正常使用的立体声唱机唱头二手设备。现在，虽然孙大振因工作不称职被免职，但他买回的这批旧机器却仍裹着塑料布在车间里“蒙头大睡”。
    上无三厂为了生产与收录机配套的收录唱组合音响，决定引进立体声唱机唱头二手设备。由于项目负责人、原厂长孙大振不负责任，1986年4月派去英国BSR公司和美国BSR分公司考察的5名成员中，竟没有一位唱机专家。他们的唱机知识基本上是在临考察前由某大学一位教师匆匆“灌输”的。在美国BSR分公司，尘垢满面的旧设备在仓库里堆放得乱七八糟，根本无法开动。这种情况违背“引进二手设备，必须考察生产流程及产品质量，然后方可监拆装运”的规定，但考察组仅提了笼统的整新要求便认可。
    外商对这项引进设备中的许多问题也负有责任，但我方项目负责人却未及时予以追究。比如交货时间未履约，未按合同提供设备资料和关键备件，应整新的设备未加整新等等。特别是两台关键设备，经反复整修调试大半年，仍无法正常运转。孙大振却还认为，颇难开口向外商提出退货索赔。
