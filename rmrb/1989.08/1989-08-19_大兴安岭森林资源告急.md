The Greater Khingan Range, severely damaged by the major forest fire of 1987, is now facing a crisis in its forest resources.

Zhang Yi, deputy secretary of the Greater Khingan Range Regional Committee, expressed his concern by comparing the results of two forest resource surveys conducted in 1964 and 1988:

Forest land has decreased from 6.32 million hectares to 5.38 million hectares, a reduction of 15%; the forest coverage rate has dropped from 70% to 64.7%; the total volume of standing timber has decreased from 720 million cubic meters to 580 million cubic meters, a reduction of 18.4%; vast areas of dense forest have turned into sparse forest; the volume of over-mature timber in commercial forests has decreased from 450 million cubic meters to 270 million cubic meters; out of the 8 forestry bureaus in the region, 3 have already exhausted their harvestable timber reserves and 22 out of 65 forest farms have either converted to other industries or will significantly reduce production. In 15 years, the entire forest area will have no timber left to harvest!

Even more alarming is the fact that the destruction of forest resources will lead to ecological deterioration!

The Greater Khingan Range serves as a natural barrier for the Songliao Plain, with functions such as regulating climate, conserving water, preventing wind erosion, purifying the environment, and protecting biological resources. Just considering water conservation, if the Greater Khingan Range loses its water storage capacity, it will lead to a sharp decrease in the water volume of the Nen River, directly affecting the water supply for the Daqing Oil Field and a number of industrial bases, and endangering the farmlands and urban-rural residents of Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.

Currently, most of the mountain tops and slopes in the region have thin soil layers, with rock debris and gravel already exposed, making it difficult to cultivate new trees. Therefore, addressing the forest resource crisis in the Greater Khingan Range is urgent.

The development and construction of the Greater Khingan Range forest area over the past 20 years have seen a rapid decline in forest resources. The reasons are as follows: for a long time, the state has implemented an economic policy in the forest area that prioritizes timber production, emphasizing logging over protection; utilization over cultivation; economic benefits over ecological and social benefits. This "big timber first" mentality has caused immense harm!

### 大兴安岭森林资源告急

    大兴安岭森林资源告急
    1987年特大森林火灾重创后的大兴安岭，当前又面临森林资源危机。
    大兴安岭地委副书记张毅忧心忡忡地对比了1964年与1988年两次森林资源调查结果：
    有林地从632万公顷减为538万公顷，减少15％；森林覆盖率由70％降至64.7％；活立木总蓄积由7.2亿立方米减至5.8亿立方米，减少18.4％；大面积密林演化成稀疏林；用材林中的过熟林蓄积由4.5亿立方米减至2.7亿立方米；全区8个林业局已有3个局可采蓄积将枯竭；65个林场已有22个转产或将大幅度减产。15年后整个林区将无木可采！
    更可怕的是，森林资源的破坏，将造成生态环境的恶化！
    大兴安岭是松辽平原的天然屏障，具有调节气候、涵养水源、防风固沙、净化环境、保护生物资源等多种功能。仅从涵养水源看，大兴安岭如果失去蓄水能力，将导致嫩江水量急剧减少，直接影响大庆油田及一大批工业基地用水，危及黑、吉两省农田及城乡居民的生活。
    目前，该地区绝大多数山顶、山坡的土层瘠薄，土层下岩屑和砾石已经裸露，培育新树不易成活。因此，解决大兴安岭森林资源危机已刻不容缓。
    大兴安岭林区开发建设20多年，森林资源如此迅速衰减，原因是：长期以来，国家在林区实行以木材生产为中心的经济政策，重采伐轻保护；重利用轻培育；重经济效益轻生态效益和社会效益。这种“大木头挂帅”的思想贻害无穷！
