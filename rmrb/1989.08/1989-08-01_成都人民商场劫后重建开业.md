	The Chengdu People's Department Store, which was destroyed by fire 56 days ago during the turmoil, reopened today.

	On the night of June 4th this year, the People's Department Store, located in the center of Chengdu City, was set on fire by criminals during the chaos. This store, with a business area of over 15,000 square meters and the largest in the southwestern region, was reduced to ashes. The loss of goods and some assets alone amounted to over 46 million yuan.

	After the People's Department Store was burned down, people from all walks of life extended helping hands. According to incomplete statistics, tens of thousands of people donated over 700,000 yuan for the reconstruction of the store. In just 30 days, a temporary business and office building covering 6,000 square meters was erected on the ruins.

    成都人民商场劫后重建开业
    新华社成都8月1日电  （记者南建）56天前在动乱中被烧毁的成都人民商场于今日恢复营业。
    今年6月4日晚，位于成都市中心的人民商场在骚乱中被歹徒纵火烧毁。这家营业面积1.5万多平方米的西南地区最大商场化为炭烬，仅商品和部分资产损失就达4600多万元。
    人民商场被焚毁后，社会各界纷纷伸出援助之手。据不完全统计，有数万名群众为重建商场捐款70多万元。仅30天，6000平方米的临时营业用房和办公用房就在废墟上拔地而起。
