Soviet Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Perfiliev said today at a press conference that rumors about the Soviet leadership proposing to exchange the Northern Territories for substantial Japanese economic investment in the Soviet Union are groundless.

The *U.S. News and World Report* recently stated that the Soviet leadership had proposed this in a secret letter to the Japanese government.

Perfiliev said that no such letter was sent, and it is impossible that such a letter could have been sent. "Japan's territorial demands on the Soviet Union have no basis, whether from a historical or international legal perspective. Our country's position on this issue has not changed."

    苏联外交部发言人声称
    苏对北方四岛立场未变
    新华社莫斯科8月9日电  苏联外交部发言人佩尔菲利耶夫今天在新闻发布会上说，关于苏联领导建议用北方四岛换取日本对苏经济大笔投资的传闻毫无根据。
    《美国新闻和世界报道》不久前说，苏联领导在给日本政府的密函中提出了这一建议。
    佩尔菲利耶夫说，没有发过这种信函，而且不可能发这样的信函。“日本对苏联的领土要求不论从历史还是从国际法角度来说，都没有根据。我国在这一问题上的立场未变。”
