If you have the opportunity to come to Guizhou, to the foothills of Wumeng Mountain, the depths of Miao Mountain, the banks of the Wujiang River, the shores of the Qingjiang River… then, perhaps, at the village entrance, on the cliffside grass slopes, you will not find it difficult to hear the passionate and enthusiastic Miao Keelang, the harmonious and melodious Dong Great Song, nor will you find it difficult to see the ingenious Buyi wax-resist dyeing, the exquisite and exquisite Tujia embroidery…

However, the world outside the mountains knows little about this.

In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, the Party and the government have always attached great importance to the work of excavating, collecting, and organizing ethnic folk art resources. Batch after batch of cultural workers have gone deep into ethnic minority areas to gather and learn, and batch after batch of ethnic folk art talents have come out from the small valleys. A large number of excellent works, such as the Qiang opera "Qin Nang Mei," "She Xiang Fu Ren," and the ethnic dance drama "Man Luo Hua," have won awards in various national art performances and competitions.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Guizhou has ended its long-term closed state. Guizhou's ethnic folk arts have not only been displayed in the country but have also shown their charming appearance to the world.

In April 1983, the performers of the Guizhou Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, with their richly colored ethnic folk song and dance programs, visited 13 cities in Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and other countries for nearly 50 days of friendly performances, opening a new chapter in Guizhou's first overseas performance of ethnic folk songs and dances. The passionate and unrestrained Miao "Treading Drum Dance" and "Ancient Gourd Dance," the deep and meaningful Buyi "Accompanying Marriage Song," and the rough and bold Water "Fighting Horn Dance" attracted the world's attention and interest in Guizhou's ethnic folk art treasures.

Thus, the advisor of the French Art Center came, the Okinawa Foundation Cultural Source Investigation Team from Japan came, the famous film director Joris Ivens came, and the music ethnologist Alan Lomax from Oxford University in the UK came… They were all amazed and fascinated by Guizhou's rich and brilliant ethnic folk culture. They came from the outside world into the valleys of Guizhou.

And Guizhou, with a more open attitude, actively introduced its ethnic folk arts, which it takes pride in, to the larger stage and world. In recent years, some of the essence of Guizhou's ethnic folk arts, such as the folk singing art of the Qidongnan Dong Women's Chorus, the ancient earth theater art of Anshun Cai Guan, the "Chinese Guizhou Ethnic Textile Art Exhibition" which showcases the costumes, silver ornaments, embroidery, batik, and other exquisite crafts of the Miao, Dong, Buyi, Water, Gejia, Hui, and Yi ethnic groups in Guizhou, the "Guizhou Ethnic Festival Cultural Exhibition Performance Team" which performs the ethnic festival customs of Guizhou, and the "Chinese Guizhou Nuo Mask Art Exhibition"… appeared on the stages, exhibition halls, and art festivals in Japan, Myanmar, and the Hong Kong region, and in the distant Monaco, Mexico, the United States, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Italy, Austria, and other countries…

During the Guizhou Provincial First Ethnic Folk Art Festival held in August this year, tens of thousands of guests from within the province, outside the province, and from overseas watched a more abundant display of ethnic folk arts. This is a grand gathering that marks the prosperity and development of ethnic folk arts over the past 40 years. Guizhou's ethnic folk culture is walking towards the country and towards the world.

    人山沟走向世界
    ——贵州的民族民间艺术
    何光渝
    如果你有机会来到贵州，走向乌蒙山麓、苗岭深处，走向乌江沿岸、清水江畔……那么，也许，在寨前村口，在崖畔草坡，你都不难听到高亢热情的苗族芦笙、和声谐协的侗族大歌，不难看到巧夺天工的布依族蜡染、精美绝伦的土家族挑花……然而，山外的世界对此并不十分了解。
    建国40年来，党和政府一直都很重视发掘、搜集、整理民族民间艺术资源的工作。一批批文艺工作者深入少数民族地区采风学习，一批批民族民间艺术人才从小山沟走出来。一大批优秀作品，如黔剧《秦娘美》、《奢香夫人》，民族舞剧《蔓萝花》等，在国内多次文艺调演、比赛中获奖。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，贵州结束了长期封闭的局面。贵州民族民间艺术不仅在国内，而且也向世界展露出了绰约风采。
    1983年4月，贵州省歌舞团各族演员，带着贵州的极富有浓郁民族色彩的民族民间歌舞节目，赴巴拿马、委内瑞拉、厄瓜多尔等国的13个城市，作了为期近50天的民间友好访问演出，揭开了贵州有史以来民族民间歌舞第一次出国演出的新篇章。那热情奔放的苗族《踩鼓舞》、《古瓢舞》，那情长意深的布依族《伴嫁歌》，那粗犷剽悍的水族《斗角舞》等，引起了世界对贵州民族民间艺术宝藏的关注与兴趣。
    于是，法国艺术中心的顾问来了，日本冲绳基金文化源流考察团来了，著名的电影大师伊文思来了，英国牛津大学的音乐人类学家艾伦·拉露来了……他们对贵州如此丰富灿烂的民族民间文化都感到迷惑、迷恋，他们从外面的世界走进了贵州的山沟中。
    而贵州，以更加开放的姿态，把自己引为骄傲的民族民间艺术，主动地介绍到外面的大舞台、大世界去。近年来，贵州民族民间艺术中的一些精华，如黔东南侗族女声合唱团的民间合唱艺术，安顺蔡官的古老地戏艺术，荟萃了贵州苗、侗、布依、水、仡佬、回、彝等民族服饰、银饰及挑花、刺绣、蜡染等精湛工艺的“中国贵州民族纺织工艺品展览”，“贵州民族节日文化展览表演队”令人惊叹的贵州各民族节日风情表演，“中国贵州傩戏面具艺术展”……出现在日本、缅甸以及香港地区，出现在遥远的摩纳哥、墨西哥、美国、西班牙、法国、英国、联邦德国、意大利、奥地利等国家的舞台上、展厅中、艺术节上……
    在今年8月间举办的贵州省首届民族民间艺术节期间，成千上万的省内外、海内外来宾，观看了更为丰富的民族民间艺术。这是标志40年来民族民间艺术繁荣发展的盛会。贵州民族民间文化正走向全国，走向世界。
