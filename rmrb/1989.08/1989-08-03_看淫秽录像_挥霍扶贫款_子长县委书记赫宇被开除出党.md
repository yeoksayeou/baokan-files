People's Daily, Xian, August 3rd. Reporter Meng Xi'an reports: He Yu, the Secretary of the Child County Committee in Shaanxi Province, has been expelled from the party for his corrupt behavior, including watching pornographic videos and squandering poverty alleviation funds amounting to over 20,000 yuan.

Child County is one of the poorest counties in the Yan'an region. In 1987 and 1988, the state provided subsidies and grants totaling 11.21 million yuan and 12.80 million yuan, respectively. During his tenure as deputy county magistrate in 1985, He Yu organized three gatherings to watch pornographic videos. After becoming the county committee secretary in 1988, he ignored the advice of his comrades and insisted on using funds from the Shaanxi Construction Technical Training to go on a "study tour." The county agricultural commission falsely created a 25,000 yuan "training plan" and withdrew funds from the county's old revolutionary base office for the "study tour."

Starting on September 26, He Yu led a 29-person delegation, consisting of township and county officials, on a grand tour. They spent less than three days in Wuxian County, Jiangsu, before abruptly changing their route to visit Hangzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Beijing, among other places, for sightseeing and leisure. The trip lasted 37 days and cost over 35,000 yuan, with 21,527 yuan spent on public-funded tourism. Additionally, he frequently failed to pay his party dues on time. Over two years, he used his position to accept free meals, drinks, and gifts worth 1,353 yuan.

    看淫秽录像　挥霍扶贫款
    子长县委书记赫宇被开除出党
    本报西安8月3日电　记者孟西安报道：陕西省子长县委书记赫宇，腐化堕落看淫秽录像，带领20多名干部游山玩水，挥霍扶贫款2万多元，最近被延安地委开除党籍。
    子长县是延安地区最贫困的县之一，1987年和1988年，先后由国家补贴、拨款1121万元和1280万元。赫宇1985年任副县长期间，曾3次聚众观看淫秽录像。1988年他担任县委书记后，不听同志们的劝阻，执意要用陕建技术培训费外出“考察”，由县农委凭空伪造了一份2.5万元“培训计划”，从县老区办取款用于外出“考察”。从9月26日起，赫宇带领由各乡镇书记、县有关部门负责人组成的29人考察团浩浩荡荡出发。他们到江苏吴县不到3天，突然改变路线，先后到杭州、上海、广州、深圳、北京等地游山玩水，历时37天，花费3.5万余元，其中用公费旅游的开支达21527元。此外，他长期不按时交纳党费；两年里，他利用职权白吃、白喝、白拿计人民币1353余元。
