Architecture professors often use the following example to illustrate the conflict between new functions and classical forms when teaching new students: The British Parliament building, started in 1840, is grand in scale, but unfortunately, it adopted the old feudal style, failing to reflect the image of a new state apparatus.

The modern architecture movement, however, aims to create an unprecedented image. It believes that the first element of modern architecture is to emphasize the functional use of the building and to use this as the starting point for architectural design; secondly, it pays attention to the characteristics of new materials and technologies. In the selection of "Excellent Works of Chinese Architecture in the 1980s," three public buildings that prioritize practicality won awards: the Shenzhen Sports Stadium (designed by Xiōng Chéngxīn, Liáng Yìngtiān, Wú Chíchǐn, etc.), the Dunhuang Airport Terminal (designed by Liú Chúnhàn, etc.), and the East China Electric Power Management Building (designed by Luó Xīnyáng, etc.). These are excellent works that take the functional use as the starting point of design and pay attention to the application of new materials and technologies.

The Shenzhen Sports Stadium is a multi-functional comprehensive venue. In its design, it fully embodies the structural characteristics of large-span buildings. Four giant supporting columns are exposed, and modern materials and technologies make the architectural image simple and robust, embodying the personality of sports architecture. The Dunhuang Airport Terminal, according to functional requirements, is set up with a rectangular passenger hall, a circular comprehensive building, and a control tower. The heavy rectangular hall and the light, white circular building form a contrast, symbolizing "Heaven is round, Earth is square." The building also appropriately uses local architectural symbols, giving it a strong regional flavor. The East China Electric Power Management Building in Shanghai is 120 meters high. If not handled well, it could become a dull office building. However, the designers cleverly conceived it, using the antenna tower and the sloping roof and the suspended dispatch layer on the upper floors to make the shape rich in variation, enriching the city's skyline. These highly practical buildings have created a new style for the times, showing that the development of modern architecture is an inevitable trend. Modern architecture draws its creative inspiration from the boundlessly rich social life. In this great era of "facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future," it is inevitable that pleasing modern architectural images will emerge.

However, some people view the imitation of ancient architectural forms as an artistic technique, which is a misunderstanding. The trend of architectural imitation still has a market. Ancient buildings with distinctive national characteristics are undoubtedly a peony in the garden of Chinese architectural art, but they should not be seen as the only orthodox style, viewing modern creative architecture as heretical. The modern architectural master Walter Gropius once ridiculed the architectural revivalists for "confusing architectural art with applied archaeology." Indeed, modern architectural art is not archaeology. The essence of modern architecture is creation. Architects, please be careful with your designs, and do not let down the trust of history.

    现代建筑艺术不是实用考古学
    王明贤
    建筑系老师给新生上课，常举下面的例子说明新的功能和古典形式的矛盾：1840年，开始建筑的英国国会大厦，规模宏大，遗憾的是套用了封建时代的古老式样，反映不出新的国家机器的形象。
    现代建筑运动却要创造亘古未有的形象。认为现代建筑的第一要素是重视建筑物的使用功能并以此作为建筑设计的出发点；其次是注意发挥新材料、新技术的特点。这次在“中国八十年代建筑艺术优秀作品”评选中获奖的有三项以实用为主的公共建筑：深圳体育馆（熊承新、梁应添、吴持敏等设计）、敦煌机场航站楼（刘纯翰等设计）、华东电业管理大楼（罗新阳等设计），正是以使用功能为设计的出发点、又注重新材料、新技术运用的佳作。
    深圳体育馆是一座多功能综合馆，在造型上充分体现大跨度建筑的结构特点，四根巨型支撑柱暴露在外，现代化的材料、技术使建筑物的艺术形象简洁、雄健，体现出体育建筑的个性。敦煌机场航站楼根据功能要求，设置了方形旅客大厅、圆形综合楼和塔台。厚重的方厅和洁白轻盈的圆楼恰成对比，暗喻“天圆地方”。该建筑还很适当地运用了当地建筑符号，具有浓烈的地域色彩。上海华东电业管理大楼，高达120米，倘若处理不好则成为呆滞的办公大楼。但设计者巧妙构思，利用天线塔楼及上部几层倾斜的屋面和调度层外悬等，使体型富于变化，丰富了城市的天际线。这些实用性很强的建筑，创造了时代的新风格，说明现代建筑的发展乃是大势所趋。现代建筑是以无限丰富的社会生活为创造源泉的。在“面向现代化、面向世界、面向未来”的伟大时代里，必然出现赏心悦目的现代建筑形象。
    但，有人却将古代建筑形式的袭用视为艺术手法，这是一种误解。建筑仿古思潮仍有市场。富有民族特色的古建筑，无疑是中国建筑艺术园地中的一朵牡丹，但决不可自封为唯一正宗，只此一家，视现代创造性建筑为异端。现代建筑大师格罗庇乌斯曾揶揄建筑界的复古主义者“把建筑艺术同实用考古学混为一谈”。是的，现代建筑艺术并非考古学。现代建筑的本质是创造。建筑师们，请下笔珍重，希望不要辜负了历史的重托。
