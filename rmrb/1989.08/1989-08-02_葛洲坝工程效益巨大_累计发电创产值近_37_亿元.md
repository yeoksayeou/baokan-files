Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 2nd.

The Gezhouba hydropower project, completed after 19 years of construction, has begun to yield tremendous benefits. By the end of June this year, all 21 generating units of the Dajian and Erjian power plants, with a total installed capacity of 2.715 million kilowatts, had started generating electricity. The cumulative electricity generation has reached 66.7 billion kilowatt-hours, creating nearly 3.7 billion yuan in value.

At today's press conference for the "The First Dam on the Ten-Thousand-Li Yangtze River" photography exhibition, officials from the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Energy revealed that since the completion of the Gezhouba Dam, the water level has risen, significantly improving the navigation conditions in the reservoir section. From the second half of 1981 to the end of June this year, the total cargo volume transported by waterways has reached 44.79 million tons, and the passenger volume has reached 17.57 million.

Additionally, the artificial breeding of Chinese sturgeon fry has been successful, with tens of thousands of fry released into the Yangtze River.

General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently praised the achievements of the builders during his inspection of the Gezhouba project.

    葛洲坝工程效益巨大
    累计发电创产值近37亿元
    本报北京8月2日讯　记者张何平、刘燮阳报道：葛洲坝水利枢纽工程在历时19年全部建成后，已开始发挥巨大效益。截至今年6月底，总装机容量271.5万千瓦的大江和二江电厂的21台机组全部发电，已累计发电667亿千瓦小时，创产值近37亿元。
    在今天召开的《“万里长江第一坝”摄影展览》新闻发布会上，水利部、能源部负责人还透露，由于葛洲坝建成后水位升高，改善了库区河段的航运条件，从1981年下半年至今年6月底，航运总货运量4479万吨，客运量1757万人次。同时，人工繁殖中华鲟幼鱼成功，长江投放幼苗数万多尾。
    中共中央总书记江泽民前不久在视察葛洲坝工程时，高度评价了建设者的功绩。
