“In the 1950s, we recalled hardships over bitter meals, in the 1960s, we were awakened by a call, in the 1970s, we engaged in extensive criticism, and in the 1980s, what should we do?” Nowadays, when it comes to ideological and political work among workers, many grassroots leaders feel like picking flowers from a thorny bush—it’s hard to get started. However, the party branch of the Second Team of the Transportation Engineering Division has a knack for finding ease in difficulty. They believe that grassroots ideological and political work must have its unique characteristics; it cannot be abstract or detached from reality. It must be face-to-face and heart-to-heart.

Face-to-Face

One day, a worker had a heart-to-heart talk with the party branch secretary: “To be honest, the reason why ideological and political work is not effective nowadays is simple: the officials only preach to others, not to themselves.” The speaker had no ulterior motive, but the party branch secretary took it to heart. He led the team to discuss a seemingly simple question: Would a stutterer have a good effect when giving a speech? The discussion concluded that a poor personal image is the main reason why ideological and political work is ineffective. Without hesitation, they immediately set three rules: leaders must work and live honestly. Over the past two years, several leaders in the team have refused bribes totaling several thousand yuan. Once, a brother unit, the Beizhouzhuang Station, sent a few small chickens for a feast, but the leaders insisted on sending them to the canteen to comfort everyone.

The party branch does not avoid contradictions. Workers who did not return to the team by the specified date should have their wages and bonuses deducted according to the regulations. Unexpectedly, this spring, several foremen and several production backbone workers were late in returning to the team. Some workers secretly rejoiced, thinking they could take advantage of the “good people’s” light. The party branch discussed and unanimously agreed that they could not show favoritism in the face of right and wrong. After the meeting, several committee members went to talk to the foremen and exchange opinions. The next day, at the general meeting of all workers, the handling decision was announced. The workers commented: The leaders handled the issue fairly, and even though the money was deducted, it made people feel good.

Heart-to-Heart

The party branch of the Second Team believes that ideological and political work cannot proceed without caring for, protecting, and understanding people.

There is a young worker in the team who works carelessly and is a stubborn “troublemaker.” Many workers think there is no hope for him. The young man also gives up, doing his job half-heartedly. Party branch secretary Old Wang took helping the young man as one of his key tasks.

One day, the secretary went to the work site to inspect the work. From afar, he saw the young man working hard. Walking up to him, the secretary praised the young man in front of everyone. Although he didn’t say much, the young man felt his face flush and his heart race, wanting to make friends with the secretary. Seeing that the young man had emotionally approached him, the secretary took the opportunity to guide him onto the right path. “With your talents, if you work hard, there’s no need to worry about the future.” The young man’s eyes lit up, feeling that the secretary’s words made sense. From that day on, the young man seemed like a different person, working diligently.

     ——铁道部第三工程局运输工程处二队是怎样做思想政治工作的
    “50年代忆苦饭，60年代一声唤，70年代大批判，80年代怎么办？”如今，一提起职工的思想政治工作，不少基层领导的感觉是刺窝里摘花——难下手。运输工程处二队党支部一班人却善于在难中找易。他们认为：基层思想政治工作要有独特之点，不能地对空，不能空对地，必须实对实，心对心。
    实对实
    有一天，一位职工和党支部书记“侃大山”：“说句实在话，现在思想政治工作之所以不灵，没别的理儿，就因为当官的理只对外，不对内，只教育别人，不教育自己。”说者无心，听者却有意，党支部书记领着一班人讨论了一个并不复杂的问题：口吃的人上台演讲，会不会有好的效果。讨论的结果，得出一个认识：自身形象不好，是思想政治工作不灵的主要原因。没二话，马上定下约法三章，咱当领导的要实实在在工作，实实在在做人。队里的几位领导，两年来先后拒贿几千元。有一回，兄弟单位北周庄车站送来几只打牙祭的小鸡，领导也坚持送到食堂慰劳了大伙儿。
    党支部一班人不回避矛盾。职工没按队里规定的日期归队，按制度必须扣除工资和奖金。没料到，今年春节后，晚归队的职工中有好几位工班长，还有几位生产骨干。有的职工暗暗欢喜，这回能借上“好人”的光了。党支部一班 人研究，一致认为在是非面前不能讲情面。会议一散，几位委员分头去做工班长的工作，交换意见。第二天，在全体职工大会上宣布了处理决定。职工议论说：领导解决问题公正，扣了钱也让人舒心。
    心对心
    二队党支部一班人认为，做思想政治工作，离开关心人，爱护人，理解人，没路走。
    队里有一位青年工人，工作吊儿郎当，是个软硬不吃的“刺头”。不少职工认为没指望。小伙子也破罐子破摔，当天和尚撞天钟。党支部书记老王把帮助小伙子作为自己的重点工作之一。
    有一天，书记到工点检查工作，老远看见小伙子活干得挺起劲。走到跟前，当着众人夸奖了小伙子。虽没说几句话，小伙子却感到脸红心跳，要和书记交朋友。书记见小伙子和自己在感情上接近了，趁机引导他走正路。“就凭你这一表人材，好好干工作，不愁没前途。”小伙子眼睛一亮，觉得书记说得有理。不蒸馒头蒸口气。打那以后，小伙子像变了一个人，工作干得呱呱叫。
