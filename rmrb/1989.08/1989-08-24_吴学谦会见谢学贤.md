Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 24th.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian said today that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should strengthen the "three links" (direct transportation, postal services, and trade), increase exchanges, and enhance understanding. This will help eliminate misunderstandings and reach a consensus.

Wu Xueqian met with Taiwanese guest Xie Xuexian, the first vice chairman of the "China Unification Alliance" and the executive director of the Taiwan Youth China Party, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this afternoon. Wu said that the history and culture of the Chinese nation have never been interrupted over the past few thousand years. We must be worthy of our ancestors and future generations. Therefore, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should strengthen mutual understanding and gradually reach a consensus on peaceful reunification.

He said that Chairman Li Xiannian told you yesterday that our policy of "one country, two systems" and peaceful reunification will not change. However, to achieve this goal, we need time and must proceed step by step. The current practical step is to strengthen the "three links," increase exchanges, and enhance understanding. This will help eliminate misunderstandings. He said that in recent years, the exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have developed quite well. By April this year, more than 700,000 Taiwanese compatriots had come to the mainland to visit relatives. The indirect trade volume between the two sides reached $1.1 billion from January to April this year. Other exchanges have also progressed quite well. Xie Xuexian agreed with this view. He believes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are complementary in economics and talent. If reunification cannot be achieved soon, it will be a great regret.

After the meeting, Wu Xueqian hosted a banquet for Xie Xuexian and his delegation. Relevant officials such as Yang Sided were present at the meeting.

    吴学谦会见谢学贤
    新华社北京8月24日电　（记者长征）国务院副总理吴学谦今天下午在会见台湾客人谢学贤时说，海峡两岸应当加强“三通”，增加往来，增进了解，这样就会消除隔阂，达成共识。
    吴学谦今天下午在钓鱼台会见了台湾“中国统一联盟”第一副主席、台湾青年中国党执行长谢学贤一行。吴学谦在会见时说，中华民族的历史和文化几千年来没有中断过，我们要对得起祖先，对得起子孙后代。为此，海峡两岸应当加强双方的相互了解，逐渐达成和平统一的共识。
    他说，昨天李先念主席对你讲了，我们的一国两制、和平统一祖国的方针政策不会变。但要实现这个目标我们需要时间，一步步地来，而当前现实的步骤就是要加强“三通”，增加往来，增进了解，这样就会消除隔阂。他说，近几年来海峡两岸的交流发展是相当好的。到今年4月份，来大陆探亲的台胞已有70多万，海峡两岸的间接贸易额今年1月至4月份达11亿美元，其他各种交流进展得也相当不错。谢学贤对此表示非常赞同。他认为，海峡两岸在经济和人才等各方面都是互补的，如果不能早点实现统一，实在是一大遗憾。
    会见后，吴学谦设便宴招待了谢学贤一行。有关方面的负责人杨斯德等会见时在座。
