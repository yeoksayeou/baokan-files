	Returning Sails (and one more)
	Chen Guangde

	Red and alluring, the pomegranate blossoms
	Filled with joy and rain
	The lone sail, in the fading atmosphere,
	Gradually approaches the shore
	The diving board is a long string of years
	Let contemplation lead to understanding
	The path in the depths of the willow wind
	Coiled in the heart
	The crescent moon, for whom?
	Painting a thirst
	All of this now
	Melts under the fiery gaze
	The blue sky presents a simple hue
	Purity is also profound
	Birth
	Fireworks call me, the night is gentle
	Spring couplets roar like a shout
	Fireworks burst forth
	Life is bright and vast
	The boundary between new and old
	Is nurtured in the time of falling yellow leaves
	First cry, earth-shattering
	Like a waterfall plunging down
	Two thousand years of repetition
	The temptation still lies ahead
	Raise the wine cup and drink deeply
	Let the soul, in that moment of seeming drunkenness,
	Ascend with the fireworks into brilliance
	At this moment, the bell rings
	The first light of day treads through the snow to join in
	Splashes a path of weariness
	And behind the ancient, unchanging screen
	A fresh segment is revealed

    归帆（外一首）
    陈广德
    红得撩人  石榴花
    装满喜悦和雨
    孤帆  在落幕的氛围里
    渐渐靠岸
    跳板是一串长长的岁月
    且用凝望领悟
    柳风深处的小径
    盘在心上
    月弯弯  为谁
    渲染渴意
    如今这一切
    都在如火的注视下融化
    蓝天呈现简略的色彩
    纯净也是深远
    诞生
    礼花召唤我  夜正温柔
    迎春爆竹如呐喊
    焰火喷涌
    生命明亮而浩瀚
    新和旧的临界点
    在黄叶飘零之时孕育
    初啼  石破天惊
    如飞瀑直下
    两千年周而复始
    诱惑仍在前面
    端酒碗仰脖畅饮
    让灵魂在似醉未醉的一瞬
    随礼花飞升成灿烂
    此时  钟声响了
    初日踏雪赶来助兴
    溅一路疲惫
    而亘古不变的屏风之后
    露出一段新鲜
