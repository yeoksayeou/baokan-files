The sun was blazing. Recently, Li Huanzheng, the secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, and several discipline inspection officials, specially came to Shaanxi's Shaanxi Province, Yanta District, Shui Chen Village, to discuss anti-corruption measures with the farmers.

In the village, many households had new wheat spread out to dry in front of their houses. Li Huanzheng knocked on the door of a house at the village entrance.

After exchanging a few words with the owner, Li Huanzheng asked, "Have you seen the seven practical things that the Central Government wants to do on television?"

"Yes, we've seen them. We've heard every word, and it all resonates with us. But we feel that the mountains are high and the emperor is far away. The Central Government's voice seems to be separated from us by thousands of mountains and rivers, and it can solve how many of our immediate problems?" the female owner replied.

"What is your biggest problem right now?"

"No water for irrigation! The team doesn't even have money to buy a water pump!" she said angrily, "In recent years, everyone has been taking care of their own business, and it seems like no one is managing the collective affairs!" Her 22-year-old nephew also fumed, "There are few village cadres who are honest, and many who are greedy. You can go and ask the village cadres what they are thinking and doing every day!"

Li Huanzheng had the township and village cadres called in and asked why they couldn't even solve the problem of buying a water pump. The village cadres had their reasons: "Even if we buy a water pump, we dare not install it! Because we have pulled several electric wires, and they have all been stolen by thieves. Some villages have even lost their water pumps!"

The village head, Yang Qinghai, said, "The current social security is too bad! Some public security bureaus catch thieves, and if they are given some money, they are released! The police stations handle cases, not only do they need to be entertained, but they also need case fees. The people do not want to report their losses, and the thieves are even more rampant..."

Li Huanzheng nodded silently, "The law enforcement agencies handling cases for commissions, how can they be fair and honest? This must be changed."

At this time, the village group leader, Wang Shungui, said, "General Secretary Jiang Zemin has issued seven orders since he took office, and the Provincial Party Committee has issued several orders?"

"The Provincial Party Committee has also drafted several items," Li Huanzheng told everyone about the several anti-corruption practical things that the province plans to do, saying, "The Provincial Party Committee will discuss it tomorrow, and I specially came today to listen to everyone's opinions."

"Having something is better than having nothing. Like this year, the province's efforts to ensure the supply of fertilizers are very good! Fertilizers are now operated by specialized agencies, and urea can be bought whenever needed. In the past, people ran around with money but couldn't buy it, and all the fertilizers were sold at high prices by those with connections."

"But the fertilizer supply has been announced, and the subsidized urea has not been supplied yet! This book should not become a deaf ear's earring—a fake!" "The road in front of the village, the city and district governments have said many times that they want to do practical things for the people, but how many years have they called for, and no one has repaired it!"

Li Huanzheng asked the district discipline inspection commission secretary, Geng Tianlu, to further implement the fertilizer supply issue and promised to report the road repair issue to the Xi'an Municipal Government. Then, they went to the fields.

The hot wind blew the corn rustling. The farmers in the field gathered around Li Huanzheng and his entourage, talking excitedly:

"The higher-ups deviate by an inch, and the lower levels dare to deviate by ten feet. To rectify the party discipline, it must start from the top!"

"The Central Government is serious this time, and I think the lower-level cadres will also be obedient!"

Yang Wen'an, an old man who had been silent and smoking, also spoke up, "Now, whether an official is good or corrupt, you can tell by looking at his house! In some places, being an official means getting rich!"

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone chimed in:

"We hope the Central Government will send more 'inspectors' to conduct secret inspections. The high-ranking officials in your province should also come down and walk around!"

"Now that there is no movement, it seems like no one is managing the party members and cadres. This time, the Party Central Committee has set an example. I hope the province will also be serious and clean up the ranks of party members and cadres!"

Every word was like a hammer hitting the secretary's heart. Li Huanzheng told everyone that he would definitely bring the farmers' opinions and his own thoughts to the Provincial Party Committee meeting tomorrow.

    村头田间话党风
    ——陕西省纪委书记
    下乡记本报记者　孟西安
    骄阳似火。不久前，陕西省纪律检查委员会书记李焕政和几位纪检干部，专程来到西安南郊雁塔区山门口的水沈村，与农民共商廉政大计。
    村子里，不少人家屋前晾晒着新麦。李焕政敲开村头一家的大门。
    李焕政与主人寒暄了几句后，问道：“中央要办的七件实事，你们从电视上看到了吧？”
    “看了。我们一条条都听了，句句说到俺们的心里。可总觉得山高皇帝远，中央的声音与咱隔着千山万水，能解决我们眼前多少困难？”女主人答道。
    “你们眼下最大的困难是什么？”
    “没水浇地！队里连个水泵都没人买！”她生气地说，“这几年都是各顾各，集体的事好像没人经管了！”她那22岁的侄子也忿忿然：“村干部姓‘廉’的少，姓‘贪’的多。你们去问问村干部整天在想什么，干什么！”……
    李焕政让人把乡和村干部找来，问为什么连水泵的问题都解决不了。村干部们却振振有词：“水泵买好了，不敢安装！因为拉了好几回电线，都被贼娃子偷割了，有的村连水泵都丢了！”
    村主任杨清海说：“现在社会治安太差！有的公安局抓了贼娃子，人家塞点钱，就又放了！派出所办案，不仅要吃请，还要破案费，群众丢了东西也不愿报案，小偷就更起劲了……”
    李焕政默默点头：“公安执法部门办案搞提成，怎么能秉公廉正？这要改。”
    这时，村民组长王顺礼又说：“江泽民总书记上台下了七道令，省委下了几道令啊？”
    “省委也拟了几条”，李焕政把省上打算办的几件廉政实事告诉大家，说，“明天省委常委就要讨论，今天特意来听听大家的意见。”
    “有总比没有强。像今年省上抓化肥供应就很好！化肥实行专营，碳氨啥时要都能买上。过去东跑西颠有钱买不上，都让有门有腿的人给倒腾卖高价了。”
    “不过化肥供应本发了，平价尿素至今还没供应！这本子可别成了聋子的耳朵——样子货呀！”
    “可不是，话说起来容易，‘嗖’的一声就从嘴里冒出来了，可要做起来，就不简单了。就说村前的路吧，市上、区上多次说要为群众办实事，可喊了多少年，也没人修！”
    李焕政要求区纪委书记耿天禄进一步落实化肥供应问题，并答应把修路一事转告西安市政府。随后，他们来到田间地头。
    炎热的风吹得玉米沙沙作响。下地的农民围着李焕政一行，七嘴八舌地议论起来：
    “上边斜一寸，下面就敢歪十尺，正党风，首先要从上头做起！”
    “中央这次动真的了，我看下边干部也就乖乖的了！”
    一直不言语、闷着头抽烟的杨文安老汉也开了腔：“现在是好官还是贪官，你到他屋里打眼一看就明白了！现在有些地方，当个官就肥了！”
    他的话音刚落，大家纷纷说：
    “希望中央多派‘巡抚大人’，下来明查暗访，你们省上的大官也常下来走走！”
      “现在没运动了，好像党员干部没人管了。这次党中央做了表率，希望省上也来真的，好好把党员干部队伍整理整理！”……
    句句话像重锤敲在纪委书记心上。李焕政对大伙说，一定要把农民群众的这些意见和自己的思虑，带到明天的省委常委会上去……
