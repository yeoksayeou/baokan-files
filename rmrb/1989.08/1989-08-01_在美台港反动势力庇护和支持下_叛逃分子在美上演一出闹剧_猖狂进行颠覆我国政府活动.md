Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 1st.

According to "Voice of America" and Western news agencies, defectors such as Yan Jiaqi and Wu'er Kaixi, who fled abroad, recently traveled from Paris to the United States. Under the shelter and support of anti-China forces in the U.S., Taiwan, and Hong Kong, they continued to brazenly carry out activities to overthrow the Chinese government. They participated in a so-called "First Conference of Chinese Students and Scholars in the U.S." in Chicago.

"Voice of America" extensively promoted and hyped this three-day "conference," which concluded on July 30. It broadcast the situation of the conference multiple times, each time for nearly half an hour. It is reported that during the conference, an organization called the "Autonomous Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars in the U.S." was established, and a "declaration" aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party of China and the People's Government was passed. The "conference" also "called for selective economic sanctions against China." According to reports, Yan Jiaqi, who recently declared at a press conference in Paris that he would "overthrow the Beijing government," cursed the "current regime" during his speech, saying it was bound to collapse. Wu'er Kaixi shouted during his speech that one day they would erect the Statue of Democracy on Tiananmen Square. It is reported that Wan Runnan and the wanted criminal, the leader of the "High Autonomy Alliance," Li Lu, also participated in this event.

The special correspondent of the Taiwan "United Daily News" reported from Chicago on July 28 that a significant portion of the funds for this "conference" was provided by pro-Taiwan "overseas leaders." The newspaper said, "Now, the anti-forces in the mainland overseas understand that actions require money, and Taiwan is one of the long-term reliable sources of funds," "Mainland democracy activists have no reason not to accept donations from pro-Taiwan overseas Chinese, but they certainly understand the political implications of accepting such donations."

The Taiwan "United Daily News" also reported on July 28 that "Wu'er Kaixi arrived in Chicago from Paris on July 25 and met with the director of the China Nationalist Party Overseas Work Committee, Zheng Xionghong, and had a photo taken together. This matter has caused widespread discussion among mainland students." The report said, "It is understood that the person who arranged this meeting was the president of the Chicago Taiwan Compatriots Association, Wu Yingyi... Wu Yingyi donated a significant amount of funds to this conference held by mainland students (the First Conference of Chinese Students and Scholars in the U.S.), thus gaining the trust of the responsible students."

It is also reported that earlier, Yan Jiaqi, Wu'er Kaixi, Wan Runnan, Su Shaozhi, Liu Binyan, and others issued a proposal in Paris on July 20 to establish a so-called "Democratic China Front," advocating the overthrow of China's socialist system. According to the Taiwan "United Daily News," the "Democratic China Front" "has had in-depth discussions on how to contact Taiwan's political forces and plans to proceed with cautious and gradual steps. In principle, as long as it supports the Chinese democratic movement, it is a common partner, so money from pro-Taiwan overseas leaders can be accepted." The secretary-general of the so-called "Democratic China Front," Wan Runnan, also told a reporter from the Taiwan "United Daily News" that he did not rule out the possibility of visiting Taiwan in the near future.

The Hong Kong "Oriental Daily" reported on July 30 that a Hong Kong organization called the "Hong Kong Citizens' Support for Patriotic Democratic Movement Union" had allocated 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars to Yan Jiaqi, Wu'er Kaixi, and others as activity funds.

The most enthusiastic supporter of the defectors' activities to overthrow the Chinese government is "Voice of America." During this period, the anti-government statements and activities of Yan Jiaqi, Wu'er Kaixi, and others have become the main content of "Voice of America"'s Chinese-language programs. Recently, "Voice of America" has broadcast two long interviews with Wu'er Kaixi, continuing to propagate the lie of the "Tiananmen Massacre." It claimed through Wu'er Kaixi that 3,000 people died in Tiananmen Square, and tens of thousands of people died in the entire city of Beijing. It also said that "almost all the patrol members of the 'Workers' Autonomous Federation' on Tiananmen Square were killed, dozens of people." However, Wu'er Kaixi, who claimed with such conviction that he "guaranteed" seeing people killed on Tiananmen Square, had to add that "of course, I did not see it with my own eyes."

Local sources pointed out that Yan Jiaqi, Wu'er Kaixi, and other defectors, with the support of anti-China forces in the U.S., Taiwan, and Hong Kong, no matter how brazenly they jump around, no matter what farcical organizations they establish, are merely a few more "Chinese Democratic League" and a few more Hu Ping and Wang Bingzhang-like clowns. Their plots have already ended in failure at home, and now, relying on anti-China forces in the U.S., Taiwan, and Hong Kong, they attempt to achieve their unspoken goals, which will also not succeed. As for "Voice of America," an official propaganda organ of the United States, it uses these defectors to shamelessly advocate the overthrow of the government of the People's Republic of China. This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs, which not only greatly hurts the national feelings of the Chinese people but also seriously damages the friendly relations between China and the United States. "Voice of America" will ultimately end up hurting itself.

    在美台港反动势力庇护和支持下
    叛逃分子在美上演一出闹剧  猖狂进行颠覆我国政府活动
    新华社北京8月1日电  据“美国之音”和西方通讯社报道，叛逃在外的严家其、吾尔开希等人近日由巴黎到达美国后，在美、台、港反动势力的庇护和支持下，继续猖狂进行颠覆我国政府的活动。他们在美国芝加哥参加上演了一个所谓“全美中国学生学者第一届代表大会”的闹剧。
    “美国之音”为这个为时三天已于7月30日收场的“会议”大肆宣传捧场。它在7月31日以每次近半小时的时间反复播出这个会议的情况。据称，在这个会议上成立了一个名叫“全美中国学生、学者自治联合会”的组织，并通过了一个旨在推翻中国共产党和人民政府的“宣言”。“会议”还“呼吁对中国进行选择性的经济制裁”。据报道，不久前在巴黎的一次记者招待会上宣称要“推翻北京政府”的严家其，在会上讲话时再次咒骂“现政权必然要垮台”。吾尔开希讲话时则叫喊“有朝一日将把民主女神竖立在天安门广场”。据报道，万润南和通缉犯、
  “高自联”头头李录也参加了这个会。
    台湾《联合报》特派记者在7月28日自芝加哥发出的报道中说，这次“会议”的经费很大一部分是由亲台湾的“侨领”资助的。这家报纸说，“现在大陆在海外的反对势力都明白，做事要钱，而台湾是长期可靠的经费来源之一”，“大陆民运人士没有理由不接受亲台湾华侨的捐款，可是他们当然了解接受这种捐款的政治影响”。
    台湾《联合报》7月28日还报道，“吾尔开希25日自巴黎飞抵芝加哥后，和中国国民党海工会（按：即‘海外工作会’）主任郑心雄见了面，并一起照了相。这事在大陆留学生群中引起广泛议论”。该报说，“据悉，安排这次见面的，是芝加哥台湾同乡联谊会会长吴英毅……吴英毅对这次大陆学生召开的大会（首届全美中国学生学者代表大会）捐献不少经费，因此获得大会负责同学信任”。
    另据报道，早些时候，严家其、吾尔开希、万润南、苏绍智、刘宾雁等人于7月20日在巴黎发表了一项成立所谓“民主中国阵线”的倡议书，鼓吹推翻中国社会主义制度。据台湾《联合报》报道，“民主中国阵线”“对于如何与台湾政治势力接触，有过深入讨论，打算以谨慎而渐进的步骤进行，基本上是承认只要是支助中国民主运动，都是共同伙伴，因此，亲台湾侨领的钱可以接受。”所谓“民主中国阵线”的秘书长万润南还对台湾《联合报》记者说，他不排除近期访台的可能性。
    香港《东方日报》7月30日报道，香港一个名叫“香港市民支援爱国民主运动联合会”的机构已给严家其、吾尔开希等人拨了120万港元，作为他们的活动经费。
    在公开支持叛逃分子推翻中国政府的活动中最卖力的是“美国之音”。这一个时期，严家其、吾尔开希等的反政府言论和活动，成了“美国之音”华语节目的主要内容。最近，“美国之音”就先后两次播送了对吾尔开希的长篇采访录音，继续宣传“血洗天安门”的谎言。它借吾尔开希之口又说什么天安门广场死了3000人，整个北京市死了几万人，还说什么“天安门广场上‘工自联’的纠察队员几乎全部被打死了，好几十人”。但是这个信誓旦旦地说什么他以“人格担保”看到天安门广场上打死了人的吾尔开希，却不得不附加说明，“当然不是我亲眼看到的”。
    此间人士指出，严家其、吾尔开希等叛逃分子，在美、台、港等反对新中国的势力的支持下不论如何猖狂蹦跳，不论成立什么闹剧班子，只不过是多几个“中国民联”和多几个胡平、王炳章之流的跳梁小丑而已。他们的阴谋已经在国内以惨败告终，现在靠美、台、港反动势力，企图达到他们不可告人的目的，也是不能得逞的。至于作为美国官方宣传机关的“美国之音”，竟然利用这些叛逃者肆无忌惮地鼓吹颠覆中华人民共和国政府，这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，不仅极大地伤害了中国人民的民族感情，也严重损害了中美两国之间的友好关系。“美国之音”这样做到头来只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
