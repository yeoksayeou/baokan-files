In recent years, agricultural high-voltage power lines in our county have frequently been stolen. Every year, approximately 6000 acres of farmland do not receive irrigation, resulting in an estimated annual grain production loss of about 850,000 kilograms.

The county's power bureau statistics show that from the second half of 1986 to the beginning of this year, a total of 68.7 kilometers of rural high-voltage lines were stolen, causing direct economic losses of 612,000 yuan. Among these, six dedicated irrigation lines to Wuli, Chahé, and Changcheng Townships were completely stolen, causing power outages for irrigation and lighting in the grain production bases of Egang, Baoping, Hongyang, Qiangyuan, and Dafeng villages. Additionally, out of the county's 22 rural pumping stations, 8 stations with 10 transformers were stolen, resulting in economic losses of 140,000 yuan. Over the past two years, the county government has allocated 211,000 yuan to repair 18 kilometers of damaged high-voltage lines and spent 120,000 yuan to purchase 9 transformers. However, the theft of agricultural power lines in the county continues to occur.

    农用电线被窃  影响粮食生产
    近几年来，我县农用高压电线经常被窃，年年约有6000亩农田得不到灌溉，据估计，每年粮食减产约85万公斤。
  县水电局统计，1986年下半年至今年初，全县农村高压线路被窃68.7公里，直接经济损失61.2万元。其中通往乌烈、叉河、昌城等乡镇的6条农田灌溉专用线被盗一空，致使峨港、保平、红阳、羌园、大风等村粮食基地的生产、照明用电中断。同时，全县22个农村抽水站中有8个站10台变压器被窃，经济损失14万元。两年多来，县政府曾先后拨款21.1万元修复了18公里被破坏的高压线路，用12万元购买了9个变压器。但是，县里农用电线被窃情况仍不断发生。
