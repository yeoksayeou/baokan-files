The autumn leaves rustle on the street. How many times have we encountered each other now?
You stand alone at the bustling crossroads, your face weary, hesitant to move forward...
You always crowd around to look at those new price tags.
You always squint your eyes to examine those faces as wrinkled as yours.
Ah, stranger, this small city must have been trampled by your footsteps countless times. Why do you still wander?
You smile bitterly.
Your forehead has the wrinkles of the Pacific Ocean.
Your heavy melancholy and childlike joy deeply moved me.
The setting sun is slowly descending upon your head.
Looking at the years drifting like mist in your eyes, I can't help but ask: Could it be that you are also a son of Dujiangyan?
You suddenly tear up.
Pointing to the towering buildings, you inquire about the names of some vanished alleys, shaking my hand to ask me to help you find your childhood...
Your convulsive passion infected me.
So, I took you to the rushing waters of Feisha Yan to listen to the sounds of childhood, to the top of Yulei Pass to pick a bunch of wild chrysanthemums from your childhood, to the edge of Fucang Pond to find the shadow of your childhood...
You finally walked away with a smile, reluctant to part with the setting sun.
Your gaunt figure I have grown familiar with...

    黄昏，徘徊街头的老人
    马及时
    街头秋叶窸窣。我们是第几次相遇了？
    白发苍苍的你孤零零地伫立在熙攘的十字口，满脸倦色，举脚不前……
    老是凑上前瞧那些崭新的吊牌。
    老是睐细眼睛打量那些和你一样多皱的面孔。
    呵，异乡人，这座小城不知被你的脚印覆盖多少遍了，你干吗还在徘徊？
    你苦笑了。
    你的额头有太平洋的皱褶。
    你的沉重的忧郁和孩子般的惊喜，深深地震撼了我。
    夕阳正在你头上徐徐降落。
    望着你眼里雾一般飘泊的岁月，我忍不住问道：莫非你也是都江堰的儿子？
    你忽然流泪了。
    指着高耸的楼群，你打听一些死去的小巷的名字，摇着我的手要我带你去寻找童年……
    你的痉挛的激情传染了我。
    于是，我带你到湍急的飞沙堰边聆听童年的声音，到玉垒关上采一束童年的野菊，到伏龙潭边找回童年的倩影……
    你终于微笑着走了，依依不舍地与夕阳一同归去。
    你那嶙峋的背影我已经熟悉……
