Eight Wuhan enterprises have proactively proposed to increase their production tasks for the second half of the year to reverse the downward trend in the city's machinery industry over the past period. The eight enterprises have collectively increased their production targets by 165 million yuan, a 24% increase over the original plan, and have increased their profit targets by 12 million yuan.

Since April this year, the collective enterprises in Wuhan's machinery industry have only completed 46.57% of their annual plan for the first half of the year. The cadres and workers of eight enterprises, including Wuhan Gas Valve Factory and Wuhan Wire and Cable Factory No. 2, have proactively proposed to raise the production targets for the second half of the year.
