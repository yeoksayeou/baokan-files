Yellow bungalows have replaced the Mongolian yurts that the Mongolian people cherish, hidden on the 2000-meter-high plateau of the Tianshan Mountains—Bayinbuluk Grassland.

The curtains are lifted, revealing the red dresses and green sleeves of Uighur women, along with their tall figures and rosy faces, all merging into the deepening twilight.

The car lights have gone out, and the train whistle is weary. Only the sound of Uighur language, "伊里哗啦," flows out from the courtyard-shaped guest rooms, showing the interest and charm of the travelers:

I couldn't understand the words of my Uighur roommates, so I sat quietly for a while. Suddenly, a beam of light poured in through the glass window, and a poem by Li Bai that my father taught me in childhood unexpectedly stirred the waves in my heart:

    "The moonlight shines through the window,
    Like frost on the ground,
    I raise my head to look at the bright moon,
    And lower my head to think of my hometown."

My hometown is far away in the distant Jiangnan, unreachable and unseen. So, I sought the moonlight of the grassland.

I lifted the door curtain and stepped out into the courtyard, walking aimlessly.

In the vast, hazy grassland, a faint blue light rises. I focused my gaze, and it turned out to be a huge crescent moon, like a freshly laid duck egg, faintly blue. It seemed to have nestled in the grass, still glistening with dew, pure, moist, and fresh.

I gazed at the moon, trying to forget the fatigue of the journey, but unexpectedly, the faint blue moon suddenly turned pale. It hung over the green grassland and suddenly appeared on long white silk ribbons. On the white silk, it seemed to be struggling to free itself from the ribbons' restraints, but it was so difficult. The ribbons pulled and wrapped it. Gradually, the ribbons lengthened and rose. Ah! The snow-capped Tianshan Mountains had not fallen asleep.

"Shao shao!"

The cold desert wind, which had howled all day, was now tired. From somewhere came the long neighing of a foal, echoing in the valley at night, sounding especially mournful. In the sound, there was clearly a sense of longing and yearning... it was a call from the hearts of living beings!

A dark shadow flashed past me, perhaps a Mongolian herder going on a night patrol of his beloved horse herd?

The shadow disappeared. Only my shadow was left for the clear moon, left for the night grassland.

The moon was still in the middle of the sky, and the frost began to rise, sparkling like pearls on the grass blades and stems, gradually turning into blocks of crystals, cold and gray-white.

My heart seemed to be frosted over, gradually becoming heavy. My body, wrapped in a wool sweater, felt the cold creeping in.

"Still not asleep?"

An old herder walked over from the other side. His eyebrows were frosted with a layer of shiny crystals. His eagle-like sharp eyes recognized me from afar. He took off a white sheep fur coat, shook off the frost, and insisted on draping it over my shivering body. We walked together into his warm room heated by cow dung. Soon, my body warmed up.

    巴音月色
    赵海洲
    黄色的平房，代替了蒙古族人恋居的蒙古包，隐匿在2000多米的天山高台——巴音布鲁克草原上。
    一幅幅珠帘掀启，那维吾尔妇女的红裳翠袖，伴着她们颀长的身影，红润的脸庞，一齐溶入愈浓愈暗的暮色中。
    车灯没了，汽笛也疲惫了，只有那伊里哗啦的维语声，从凵字型的客房中流泻出来，显示了旅人的兴趣与情趣：
    我听不懂同房维族同胞的话语，闷坐了一晌，忽见一道亮光，从玻璃窗棂泻进了房内，童年时父亲教我的李白那首五言绝句，无端的激起心潮的浪花：
    “窗前明月光，
    疑是地上霜，
    举头望明月，
    低头思故乡。”
    故乡，远在万里外的江南，寻不着，望不见。于是，我觅起草原的月色来。
    掀开门帘，踏出院坪，信步而走。
    茫茫的朦胧的草原的那边，升腾起一道淡青的亮光。我定神一望，原来是一弯偌大的半圆月，仿佛是刚下的鸭蛋，淡青青的。又好像它在草丛中偎依过，似乎还闪着水珠儿，洁净、湿润、水灵。
    我凝神望着月亮，竭力想把旅途的劳顿忘却，殊不料，淡青的月亮倏忽间苍白了，它从黛绿的草原上忽地挂在一匹匹长长的白练上。在白练上，殊不知它一挪一挪的，我想，它似乎要脱离白练的羁绊，却是那么的艰辛。白练在拉扯它裹着它。渐渐地，白练拉长了，升高了。啊！雪线上的天山并没有酣睡。
    “萧萧！”
    呼啸了一天的凛冽的漠风，现在倦了；哪里传来了马驹长长的嘶鸣，在夜阑人?的山谷，显得格外的凄切。声音里，分明有惆怅，有焦盼……那是从一个个生灵里迸发的呼唤啊！
    一道黑影从我面前掠过，许是蒙古牧人，去夜巡他心爱的马群？
    黑影消失了。只有我的影子留给了清月，留给了夜的草原。
    月眉还在中天，霜潮起来，在草叶上，在茎秆上，先是一点一点的闪着珠子似的光点，渐渐地，变成一块一块的晶体，冷冷的，灰白的。
    我的心似乎也潮着霜，逐渐地凝重了。裹着毛线衣的身体，似乎寒意袭人。
    “还没有睡着？”
    老牧人从那边走来，他的眉毛结了一层晶亮的霜花。他那双鹰般锐利的眼睛。远远地，他就认出了我。他把一件白板子羊皮衣脱下来，拍掉上面的霜花，硬要披在我颤栗的身上。我们一道走进了他那间牛粪火很旺的宿舍里。不多一会，身子暖和了。
