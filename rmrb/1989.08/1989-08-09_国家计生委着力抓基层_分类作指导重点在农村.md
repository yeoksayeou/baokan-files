The National Family Planning Commission is taking steps to ensure that its work is effectively implemented at the grassroots level. It is adopting new measures to provide classified guidance and planning for local work. Each year, it will focus on helping a portion of the regions to strengthen their grassroots work, aiming to improve the face of grassroots family planning work in stages over a few years.

In recent years, relevant departments have strengthened grassroots work, effectively controlling rapid population growth in some areas. However, overall, the grassroots work in most rural areas remains weak, and some places have even become paralyzed.

To address this, the Commission has set out three different requirements:

- In areas where the work foundation is relatively good, the goal is to further improve the work level, achieve scientific, institutionalized, and standardized management, and move towards pre-pregnancy management. The aim is to reduce the rate of induced abortions as much as possible;

- In areas where the work has a certain foundation, efforts should be made to mobilize and organize active participants to engage in family planning work. Comprehensive services, including technical services, should be improved to overcome weak links in the work and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the people;

- In areas where work is more challenging, efforts should be made to change the laissez-faire attitude, establish a village-level work network, and ensure that there are always people doing the work at the grassroots level. The focus should be on solving issues related to multiple births and early marriage and childbearing.

It is reported that some provinces and cities have already begun to help regions with high birth rates and multiple births to change their situation. Some Party and government leaders have taken on the responsibility of connecting with backward regions, frequently going down to help and inspect family planning work.

    国家计生委着力抓基层  分类作指导重点在农村
    新华社北京8月9日电  （记者于长洪、杜新）国家计划生育委员会为把工作落到实处，正采取最新措施：对各地基层工作实行分类指导，并做出规划；每年重点帮助一部分地区加强基层工作，在几年内分期分批地使基层的计划生育工作面貌得以改观。
    近年来，有关部门加强基层工作，使一些地方人口的快速增长得到有效控制。但总的看来，大部分农村的基层工作仍然薄弱，少数地方甚至陷入瘫痪。
    为此，计生委提出三种不同的要求：
    ——在工作基础较好的地方，要进一步提高工作水平，实现管理的科学化、制度化、规范化，向孕前型管理方向发展，尽可能减少人工流产率；
    ——在工作已有一定基础的地方，要发动和组织积极分子参与计划生育工作，认真搞好技术服务等多方面的服务，克服工作中的薄弱环节，密切党群关系；
    ——在工作困难较多的地方，要改变放任自流现象，健全乡村工作网络，保证在基层经常有人做工作，并着重解决多胎生育和早婚早育问题。
    据介绍，此前一些省市已开始帮助出生率、多胎率高的地区改变面貌，有的党政领导分工联系后进地区，经常下去帮助和检查计划生育工作。
