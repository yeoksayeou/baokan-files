Today morning, the Uno Cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting and decided to resign en masse. In the afternoon, the prime minister nomination elections for both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors were held. Based on the majority vote, the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors respectively nominated Liberal Democratic Party President Kaifu Toshiki and Socialist Party Chairman Doi Takako as candidates for the new prime minister. Since the decision of the House of Representatives takes precedence, it was finally announced that Kaifu Toshiki was elected as the 76th and 48th Prime Minister of Japan.

At 6:52 PM, Kaifu Toshiki entered the Prime Minister's Official Residence to form the cabinet. At 10:30 PM, Yamashita Tokuji, the new cabinet's Chief Cabinet Secretary and spokesperson, met with reporters at the Prime Minister's Official Residence and announced the list of new cabinet members: Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki, Minister of Justice Goto Masao, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nakayama Tarō, Minister of Finance Hashimoto Ryūtarō, Minister of Education Ishibashi Ichiyō, Minister of Health and Welfare Tsuboi Saburō, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Kanō Michihiko, Minister of International Trade and Industry Matsunaga Mitsuru, Minister of Transport Etō Takami, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Ōishi Chōhachi, Minister of Labor Fukushima Ryōji, Minister of Construction Harada Shōsa, Minister of Home Affairs and Commissioner of the National Public Safety Commission Watanabe Kōzo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yamashita Tokuji, Director-General of the Management and Coordination Agency Mizuno Kiyoshi, Director-General of the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Okinawa Development Agency Abe Fumio, Director-General of the Defense Agency Matsumoto Jūrō, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency Takahashi Sumiko (female), Director-General of the Science and Technology Agency Saitō Eizaburō, Director-General of the Environment Agency Moriyama Mayumi (female), Director-General of the Land Agency Ishii Kazuhiko.

The average age of the new cabinet members is 62.6 years. The selection of cabinet members still follows the principle of balancing factions. For the first time, a civilian woman has entered the cabinet, and two women have become cabinet ministers.
