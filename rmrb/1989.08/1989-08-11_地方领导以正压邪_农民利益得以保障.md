In May of this year, the Qingyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in our district purchased a batch of fertilizer from outside, intending to sell it to local farmers with tickets. Some leaders took this opportunity to act arbitrarily, issuing tickets and permits indiscriminately. As a result, some farmers who genuinely needed fertilizer could not obtain tickets, while a few individuals were engaged in the illegal sale of fertilizer and fertilizer tickets. A single bag of fertilizer could yield a profit of twenty to thirty yuan, and these individuals profited from this, disrupting the supply of fertilizer. The farmers were extremely indignant and reported the issue to the Qingyan Town Government en masse. The deputy secretary of the town committee in charge of agriculture, Tan Shengzhong, upon learning of the situation, immediately rushed to the Qingyan Supply and Marketing Cooperative's agricultural resources market to investigate. He personally apprehended one individual involved in the illegal sale of fertilizer tickets.

Subsequently, the town government dispatched personnel to conduct regular inspections, discovering instances of illegal fertilizer and fertilizer ticket sales, and confiscating them on the spot. The town government also decided to start the investigation from within, stipulating that if any cadres or party members were found to have infringed upon the interests of the masses or engaged in corruption, they would be severely punished and their cases would be made public.

    地方领导以正压邪  农民利益得以保障
    今年5月，我区青岩供销社从外地购来一批化肥，准备凭票卖给当地农民。个别领导便借机看人行事，乱批条子，乱发票证，一些真正急需化肥的农民得不到化肥票，而个别人却在倒卖化肥和化肥票。一袋化肥可赚二三十元，这些人从中牟利，扰乱化肥供应。农民群众对此气愤至极，纷纷向青岩镇政府反映。负责分管农业的镇委副书记谭盛忠得知后，立即赶到青岩供销社农资门市部了解情况，并亲自抓获一名倒卖化肥票的不法分子。
    之后，镇政府又派专人巡回检查，发现有人倒卖化肥、化肥票，当场没收。镇政府还决定从内部查起，凡干部、党员侵占群众利益，以权谋私者，一经查出，必须从严处理，公布于众。
