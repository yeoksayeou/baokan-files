When mentioning Wuxi County, people often praise its renowned township and village industries. However, the county's agriculture has also made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the construction of a three-tier agricultural service system at the county, township, and village levels. Each village has established an agricultural comprehensive service station, injecting new vitality into agriculture and ensuring stable increases in agricultural production. Last year, the county's 750,000 mu of grain fields achieved a record yield of 775 kilograms per mu, exceeding the state's grain procurement quota.

Over the years, Wuxi County has established 4,800 enterprises at the township and village levels, employing local farmers who often struggle to balance work and farming. Tens of thousands of procurement and sales personnel work outside the county year-round, leaving little time or energy to tend to their responsibility fields; some even let their fields lie fallow. The most challenging issue is pest control—either they can't buy pesticides, or they don't know how much to use or when to apply them. If the dosage is too low, it won't kill the pests; if it's too high, it will damage the crops. The realities of agricultural production urgently require strengthening specialized agricultural services. Starting in 1983, Wuxi County has strengthened the construction of its three-tier agricultural service system. By the end of last year, all 557 natural villages in the county had established agricultural comprehensive service stations. 14,525 agricultural technicians have taken on the responsibility of providing labor and technical services for the county's grain fields from sowing to harvesting, covering 100% of the area.

In the construction of village-level agricultural comprehensive service stations, the county first developed services such as water management, fertilizer and pesticide sales, and basic mechanized farming in economically underdeveloped villages. For villages with some economic strength, they strengthened specialized pest control, unified seed supply, and low-end agricultural machinery services. As the economic strength of these two types of regions grows, they continuously add specialized services. For economically robust townships and villages, they established standardized agricultural comprehensive service stations, equipped with advanced facilities, and provided comprehensive integrated services. The county allocates more than 10 million yuan annually from the profits of township and village industries to the agricultural service system. Last year, the county raised 35 million yuan for agricultural construction, focusing on agricultural infrastructure and purchasing farm machinery. The county renovated 330 kilometers of underground canals, built 4,509 mu of "three-hidden" (hidden irrigation, hidden drainage, hidden water reduction) grain fields, and added 294 large and medium-sized machines.

Wuxi County's township and village industries are well-developed, with surplus labor fully utilized. Initially, some specialized farming households expanded their operations but lacked the necessary production conditions, relying on hiring large numbers of workers to compensate, without achieving actual economies of scale. Some specialized farming households lacked production skills and poor management, resulting in widespread but shallow cultivation, becoming an economic burden. We spoke with many county, township, and village cadres, and they all agreed: developing village-level comprehensive services, integrating agricultural machinery, water conservancy, agricultural technology, fertilizer, and pesticide supply services into a unified system; when this service system reaches a certain stage of development, it will form a new industry with a strong economic entity. The agricultural technology department will then have sufficient strength to provide comprehensive supporting services, and the conditions for moderate-scale agricultural operations will gradually mature.

Currently, townships like Dongxu, Yanqiao, and Yuqi, which have successfully implemented moderate-scale operations, are also those that have done well in pre-production, in-production, and post-production comprehensive services. Dongxu Township started early and developed rapidly in moderate-scale agricultural operations. Now, 101 large grain farmers have taken on all the responsibility fields in the township. Due to the high-quality series of services provided by the village-level comprehensive service stations, such as "carrying without shoulders, transplanting without hands, harvesting without sickles, digging ditches without shovels, and pest control without backpacks," each mu of double-cropped rice and wheat only requires 6-8 labor days. In Wuxi County, 2.5% of the rural labor force engaged in specialized agricultural services has replaced 20% of the county's agricultural labor input.

Accompanied by Zhou Jinsheng, the head of Houzhuang Township, we visited Jian'an Bridge Village. Upon entering the village's agricultural comprehensive service station courtyard, a brand-new two-story building came into view. Old Zhou said that the building was constructed two years ago; the upper floor is the service station and the village office, while the lower floor is various warehouses and machine rooms. During our tour, we saw fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds neatly stacked, and the machinery maintenance rate was over 90%. The village's agricultural comprehensive service station has fixed assets worth 1.5 million yuan, over 100 machines and equipment, and 8 agricultural technical service personnel who take on most of the technical, material, and labor services for the village's responsibility fields from sowing to harvesting.

At a meeting held here, we learned that agricultural technical personnel are on the payroll of factories (township-owned enterprises), with salaries transferred to the station, and performance-based pay, earning 10% more than township and village enterprise employees, with high work enthusiasm. Farmers said that now hiring someone to transplant one mu of seedlings costs 25 yuan. The agricultural service station takes on all the major farming activities for one mu of land in two seasons, charging 30 yuan, which we are willing and satisfied with. Jian'an Bridge Village's sign factory salesperson Zhou Yi said, "In the past, my family's more than six mu of responsibility fields were difficult to manage, causing a lot of trouble. Now, harvesting, threshing, drying, and returning straw to the field are all done in one go. During harvest time, we only need to bring a bag to the field to collect the grain, which is very convenient."

In the fields, the high-yield wheat plots are connected in blocks, with heavy ears of wheat turning from green to yellow, swaying in the wind like waves welcoming a bountiful harvest. Surrounding the high-yield plots are crisscrossing ditches for irrigation and drainage. Strangely, there are no ridges or ditches in the wheat fields. As we were puzzling over this, Old Zhou explained. He said these high-yield wheat fields have "hidden irrigation, hidden drainage, hidden water reduction" pipeline projects, ensuring a stable harvest regardless of drought or flood. One-third of the township's farmland has reached this standard. Speaking of this, he suddenly changed the topic: Some places say that by making a phone call, fertilizers and pesticides will be delivered. Now we don't need to make phone calls; all agricultural materials and technical services are guided by production plans, implemented through technical contracts, and assigned to villages and individuals. The entire production activity proceeds in an orderly and conscious manner.

    服务站推动无锡农业
    占农村劳力2.5％的服务人员，取代了全县20％的农业劳动力的投入；服务站将一亩地两季的主要农活全包下，收费30元

    提起江苏无锡县，都会翘起大拇指，夸它乡镇工业闻名全国。其实，这个县的农业这几年也搞得很有特色，尤其是县、乡、村三级农业服务体系建设，村村建起农业综合服务站，给农业增添了新的活力，使农业生产连续稳定增产。去年，全县75万亩粮田，单产创775公斤的纪录，超额完成了上交国家的定购粮任务。
    无锡县这些年来乡村两级共办了4800个企业，做工的都是本乡本土的农民，他们亦工亦农，往往顾此失彼；上万名采购经销员常年在外工作，没时间、没心思侍弄责任田，有的甚至把田种荒；最头痛难办的事，要数防治病虫害，不是买不到农药，就是掌握不准用药量和治虫时机，药用少了治不死虫，用多了又烧死作物……农业生产的实际，迫切要求强化农业的专业服务。从1983年起，无锡县加强了县、乡、村三级农业服务体系建设。到去年底为止，全县557个自然村，村村建起农业综合服务站，14525个农民技术员，承包了全县粮田从种到收主要农活的劳务和技术服务，覆盖面达100％。
    在村级农业综合服务站的建设中，县里对那些经济不发达的村，先发展一些管水、代销化肥、农药及初级机耕等服务项目。对有一定经济实力的村，加强专业植保、统一供种和低档农机作业服务。这两类地区随着经济实力的增长，也不断增加了专业化服务项目。对那些经济实力雄厚的乡村，建立标准化的农业综合服务站，添置高档装备设施，开展综合配套服务。县里每年都从乡镇工业利润中拿出1000多万元投入农业服务体系建设。去年，全县提留建农资金3500万元，重点投放在农田基建和添置农机具。全县翻建地下渠道330公里，建“三暗”
  （暗灌、暗排、暗降）粮田4509亩，新添大中型机械294台。
    无锡县乡镇工业发达，全部剩余劳力安排完还不够。开始，有些种养专业户扩大经营规模后，因生产条件跟不上，通过大量雇工来弥补，没有获得实际的规模效益。也有些种养专业户缺乏生产技能，管理不善，广种薄收，反而成了一种经济负担。我们接触到不少县、乡、村干部，他们有一个共同的看法：发展村级综合服务，把农机、水利、农技、化肥农药等供应服务工作联成一体；这种服务体系发展壮大到一定阶段，建成有强大经济实体的新型产业，农技部门就有足够实力开展多方面配套服务，农业适度规模经营的条件也逐渐成熟。
    现在适度规模经营搞得好的东?、堰桥、玉祁等乡镇，也是产前、产中、产后综合服务搞得好的乡镇。东?镇农业适度规模经营起步早，发展快。如今，由101户种粮大户承包了全镇所有责任田，由于村级综合服务站为多数种粮大户提供了“挑担不用肩、插秧不用手、割禾不用镰刀、开沟不用铁锹、治虫不用‘背包’”的优质系列服务，每亩稻、麦两熟只需6—8个工。在无锡县，占农村总劳动力2.5％的农业专业服务人员的社会化服务，取代了全县20％的农业劳动力的投入。
    在后宅乡负责人邹金生陪同下，我们访问了建安桥村。进入村农业综合服务站大院，一幢崭新的二层楼映入眼帘。老邹说，这楼是前年盖的，楼上是服务站和大队办公室，楼下是各种库房和机房。参观中，我们看到化肥、农药、种子码放得整整齐齐，机械维修完好率在90％以上。村农业综合服务站有固定资产150万元，有各种机械100多台（件）。8个农技服务人员承包了全村责任田从种到收的大部分技术、物资、劳务服务。
    在这里举行的座谈会上我们了解到，农民技术人员编制在厂（乡办企业），工资转帐到站，实行考核发放，报酬比乡、村办企业工作人员高出10％，工作积极性很高。农民说，现在雇人插一亩秧要花费25元。一亩地一年两季的主要农活农业服务站全包了，每亩收费30元，我们愿意，也满意。建安桥村标牌厂购销员邹益说，过去我家6亩多责任田种不好，愁死人。现在收割、脱粒、飏谷、秸秆还田一气呵成，收获时只需带上麻袋到田里装装粮，太方便了。
    在田野，小麦丰产方块块相接，沉甸甸的麦穗由青泛黄，随风摇曳，如海浪笑迎丰收。丰产方四周沟渠纵横，能灌能排。奇怪的是麦田中无畦无渠，正在疑惑不解之时，老邹给解了疑。他说这些高产麦田中铺设了“暗灌、暗排、暗降”管道工程，旱涝保收。全乡有1／3的农田达到了这个标准。说到这，他忽然把话锋一转：有的地方说打个电话化肥、农药就送来了。我们现在不用打电话，一切农用物资和技术服务均由生产计划指导，通过技术承包，落实到村到人，整个生产活动自觉有序地进行。
