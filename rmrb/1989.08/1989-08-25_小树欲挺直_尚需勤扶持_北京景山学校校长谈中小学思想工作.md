At a recent meeting organized by the Beijing Municipal Dongcheng District Education Bureau, principals from various primary and secondary schools discussed the topic "The biggest mistake in the past decade of reform is education." The views expressed by Cui Mengming, the principal of Beijing Jing Shan School, were obviously the result of deep reflection.

School Education Cannot Withstand Unhealthy Social Trends

Principal Cui believes that when Deng Xiaoping mentioned the mistake in the past decade of reform being education, he was not referring solely to school education, but to the overall weakness in societal ideological education. For years, the focus has been on how to conduct ideological and political education in primary and secondary schools in the new context of reform and opening up, how to adapt, and how to guide, but effective methods have been lacking. Teachers are frustrated because no matter how much they teach in school, students seem to forget it all once they step out into society. Teachers struggle to keep up with students' thoughts, always feeling inadequate. Although the State Education Commission has issued guidelines for student behavior, they have not been very effective. Why? The impact of a commodity economy on the entire society, the influence of the "uselessness of studying" ideology, unhealthy films, books, and publications, and the interference of bourgeois liberalization, among other factors, are all very serious. School education seems weak and powerless in the face of these issues. In the previous phase of opposing bourgeois liberalization and "spiritual pollution," the lack of effective propaganda and measures at the higher levels led to confusion among some people about what bourgeois liberalization and spiritual pollution actually mean. We need to clarify the manifestations and dangers of bourgeois liberalization, as well as the relationship between reform and opening up and the opposition to bourgeois liberalization, to avoid making the opposition to bourgeois liberalization merely a formality that ends up being ineffective.

Behind High Scores in Political Exams

When teachers in political classes talk about the superiority of socialism and the inevitable victory of socialism, they do not do so with conviction. Students either do not bother to listen or laugh it off, because they have heard and seen many negative aspects of society. They believe what teachers say is not true, but in order to pass the college entrance exam, they must memorize these points to avoid losing points. In reality, the more they memorize, the more they resent it. Therefore, although students' political exam scores are not low, what is their true ideological state? Such educational methods, even if they do not completely fail, are at best minimally effective. Teachers lack the confidence to teach because they lack vivid examples and materials.

Therefore, in addition to improving the political curriculum, students should be given more opportunities for social practice and interaction with workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that they can personally experience the superiority of socialism and the class feelings of the people supporting socialism.

How Should Education Be Conducted?

In recent years, our country's psychological and educational research has been heavily influenced by Western ideas. Although there has been some criticism, many students and teachers generally believe that the West is better, leading to a trend of studying abroad. The focus is on key high schools preparing students for universities, universities preparing students for graduate school and studying abroad, and even some high school students having the opportunity to study abroad. Some people go abroad to better serve the country upon their return, but not everyone's motives and thoughts for going abroad are so healthy. In fact, Western universities are mainly better equipped, but some of our teachers and students blindly admire them, doubting the socialist system, reasoning that life on the mainland is not as good as in Taiwan and Hong Kong. These issues make it difficult for some teachers to respond, and thus education is ineffective.

The Guidance of Life View Cannot Be Ignored

In recent years, schools have also been weak in educating students on their worldviews and life views. This is because propaganda has emphasized self-design, self-realization, and self-struggle, stressing self-value. Primary and secondary school leaders feel powerless in this regard. In the 1950s and 1960s, Paul and Wu Yunduo were our living examples, and some of their famous sayings are still remembered today. Now when we talk about these things to students, they will say we are fools. The education of students' life ideals is also poor. After Comrade Deng Xiaoping proposed "four-haves" education, there was debate over whether to conduct ideal education for students. In fact, we emphasized ideal education right after liberation. The guidance of life view is a problem that plagues education. Extreme individualism leads to anarchism and the idea of lawlessness, doing whatever one wants, which will cause problems. Education should guide students on how to be a person, to be independent and self-reliant. Education and guidance should start from a young age, strictly requiring them to be humble and respectful to teachers. There is too little propaganda in this regard, so students think they are the pride of the heavens, unique and unmatched.

Primary and secondary schools should focus on cultivating the quality of people, conducting "three orientations" and "four-haves" education based on the foundation of one central task and two basic points, so that students can develop morally, intellectually, physically, aesthetically, and labor-wise. School education should clarify what to prioritize and what to center on.

Political and Ideological Education Should Be Curriculum-Based

Jing Shan School is a school that experiments with comprehensive reform. In the new school year, they plan to strengthen political and ideological education, making it curriculum-based, setting up courses on the situation and ethics; organizing various thematic activities to educate students on how to live a good life; focusing on strengthening political and history courses, and emphasizing the political and ideological education in language courses, implementing "unity of literature and morality," using thought to guide language, and integrating moral education into all subjects; and coordinating with families to improve family education. They plan to improve the status of teachers doing political work, giving them the role they deserve, to change the passive situation of political and ideological work.

    小树欲挺直  尚需勤扶持
    ——北京景山学校校长谈中小学思想工作
    本报记者　王娜梅
    在最近北京市东城区教育局组织的一次中小学校长座谈会上，与会人士就大家都很关心的“十年改革最大失误是教育”这一命题纷纷谈了自己的看法。北京景山学校崔孟明校长对于近年来中小学思想政治工作的观点，显然经过深思熟虑。
    学校教育难敌不良社会思潮
    崔校长认为邓小平说十年改革失误是教育，并不单指学校教育，而指整个社会思想教育工作薄弱。这几年一直在研究在改革开放新形势下中小学思想政治工作如何搞、怎样适应、怎样引导，但始终缺乏办法。教师们苦恼的是，学校教育哪怕说上1万句，学生一到社会上这1万句就全白说了。教师对学生的思想穷于应付，总是不得法，国家教委虽下发了中小学行为规范，也不大奏效。为什么？商品经济对整个社会的冲击，读书无用论的影响，不健康的影视书刊以及资产阶级自由化等等的干扰，都很严重。学校教育对此显得软弱无力。前一阶段反对过资产阶级自由化和“精神污染”，但由于上面没有抓紧，宣传和措施都不得力，下边一些人对什么是资产阶级自由化、什么是精神污染概念也没有弄清楚。我们还要搞清资产阶级自由化的表现与危害，以及改革开放和反对资产阶级自由化的关系，才不会造成反对资产阶级自由化只是走走形式，最后不了了之。
    在政治课考试高分的背后
    政治课上教师讲社会主义优越性、社会主义必然胜利时不理直气壮，学生也不屑听或一笑置之，因为他在社会上听到、见到了不少社会阴暗面，自以为你说的不是事实，但为了应付高考，他必须把这些背得烂熟，否则就要被扣分。事实上他越背越增加他的反感，所以虽然每次高考学生们的政治课考分都不低，但思想上的真实面貌又怎样呢！这样的教育方法即使不是根本达不到目的，也是收效甚微。教师讲课不理直气壮，因为手头缺乏生动的实例和材料。
    因此，政治课除改进教材外，要给学生增加社会实践和接触工农兵的机会，让他们亲身感受社会主义的优越性，亲身感受人民群众拥护社会主义的阶级感情。
    教育究竟怎么搞？这几年我国的心理、教育研究等等也都是偏重西方，当然也有所批判，但许多学生教师总的来说都认为西方好，出现出国潮。基本是重点中学为大学做预科，大学为研究生、大学生出国做准备，甚至一些高中生有机会也出国。有些人出国是为了将来回国后更好地为国家做贡献，但并不是每个人出国所抱动机和想法都那么健康。事实上西方大学主要是设备好一些，而我们的一些教师学生盲目崇拜，对社会主义制度产生怀疑，理由是大陆生活就是不如台湾、香港。这些问题，有的教师也感到不好回答，因此教育也起不到效果。
    人生观导向不容忽视
    另外这几年学校对学生的世界观、人生观教育也比较薄弱，这是因为近年来宣传上对自我设计、自我实现、自我奋斗方面讲得较多，强调自我价值，中小学领导对此感到无能为力。而50—60年代，保尔、吴运铎都是我们活生生的榜样，他们的一些名言警句直到现在我们还铭记在心。现在我们对学生讲这些，他们却会说我们是傻瓜。对学生的人生理想教育也很差，小平同志提出“四有”教育后，要不要对学生进行理想教育，理解上有不同、有争论，实际上我们刚解放时就强调理想教育。人生导向是困扰教育的一个方面，极端个人主义导至无政府主义、无法制观念，想怎么干就怎么干，就要出问题。应教育引导学生如何做人，自主自立，教育引导也要从小灌输，要严格要求他们谦虚好学、尊敬师长，这方面宣传太少，学生就认为自己是天之骄子，唯我独尊。
    中小学要重视培养人的质量，要在贯彻一个中心、两个基本点的基础上对学生进行“三个面向”、“四有”教育，让学生德智体美劳全面发展。学校教育应把什么放第一位、以什么为中心，应该搞清楚。
    思想政治教育课程化
    景山学校是搞整体改革实验的一所学校，准备在新学年的实验中加强政治思想教育，使之课程化，设形势课、品德课；开展各种主题活动，教育学生走好人生之路；重点加强政治课、历史课，强化语文课的思想政治教育，实行“文道统一”，以思想带文字，将德育寓于各科教学之中；并抓紧配合搞好家庭教育。他们设想提高做政治工作教师的地位，发挥其应有的作用，以改变政治思想工作的被动局面。
