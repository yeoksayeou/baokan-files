Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 10th.

At yesterday's bimonthly theoretical work symposium, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji proposed that we should better organize and rely on comrades who adhere to Marxism, understand the actual situation, and have a solid theoretical foundation to play their roles.

The bimonthly theoretical work symposium was established by Comrade Jiang Zemin during his time in Shanghai to strengthen the connection between the municipal Party committee leadership and theoretical workers, to timely understand the latest research results in the theoretical field, and to promote the democratization and scientific nature of the government's decision-making process. Comrade Jiang Zemin has participated in five such symposiums.

This symposium mainly discussed how Shanghai can further advance reform and opening up.

Zhu Rongji spoke at the meeting, saying that theoretical work is indeed very important. However, in the previous stage, our Marxist theoretical team did not play a sufficient role. Many truly capable comrades were not organized, while those who lack actual work experience and have only a superficial understanding of real theory were allowed to spread misinformation, which has hindered our work. He hopes that relevant departments and theoretical workers will work together to promote the integration of theoretical work and practical work, raising theoretical work to a new level. In terms of public opinion and propaganda, we need to strengthen the study of economic theory and the reporting of economic information to match Shanghai's economic status.

Zhu Rongji said that the vast majority of intellectuals in Shanghai stood with the Party and the people during the recent turmoil, and their performance was good. Although a small number of people performed poorly, they do not represent Shanghai's intellectuals. Zhu Rongji also emphasized that the Party's policy towards intellectuals will not change, nor will the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy. We should create a better environment and conditions for the academic community to discuss and research, so as to better adhere to the "one center, two basic points."

The symposium was chaired by Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Deputy Secretary and Propaganda Department Director Chen Zhilin.

    朱熔基在上海双月理论工作座谈会上提出
    把理论工作提高到新水平
    要发挥坚持马克思主义理论功底扎实同志的作用
    新华社上海8月10日电　（通讯员吴修艺、王禾庭）中共上海市委书记、市长朱熔基在昨天举行的双月理论工作座谈会上提出，我们要更好地组织和依靠坚持马克思主义、了解实际情况、有扎实理论功底的同志，发挥他们的作用。
    双月理论工作座谈会，是江泽民同志在沪工作期间，为了密切市委领导与理论工作者的联系，及时了解理论界最新研究成果，加强政府部门决策过程的民主化和科学化而建立的一项制度。江泽民同志曾先后参加过5次座谈会。
    这次座谈会主要讨论了上海如何进一步搞好改革开放的问题。
    朱熔基在会上发言说，理论工作确实非常重要。但是前一阶段，我们的马克思主义理论队伍发挥作用不够，一些真正有水平的同志没有组织起来，而让那些既无实际工作经验，又对真正的理论一知半解的所谓“精英”到处胡说八道，贻误了我们的工作。他希望有关方面和广大理论工作者一起，推进理论工作和实际工作的结合，把理论工作提高到一个新水平。在舆论宣传上，要加强经济理论的研究和经济信息的报道，这样才能与上海的经济地位相适应。
    朱熔基说，上海知识界的绝大多数同志在这次动乱中是站在党和人民一边的，表现是好的。虽然也有极少数人表现不好，但他们不能代表上海知识界。朱熔基还强调，党的知识分子政策不会变，双百方针也不会变。我们应该为学术界创造更好的探讨和研究的环境、条件，这样才能更好地坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”。
    座谈会由上海市委副书记、宣传部部长陈至立主持。
