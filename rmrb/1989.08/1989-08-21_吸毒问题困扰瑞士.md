The scenic Alps, precision watches, and fine chocolates attract many tourists to Switzerland. Who would have thought that in this wealthy country, where unemployment is virtually non-existent, the most troubling issue today is youth drug abuse.

Switzerland has become one of the countries with the highest per capita drug users in the world. Last year, 205 people died from drug abuse in Switzerland (compared to 136 in 1986). Statistics for the first half of this year indicate that this number will significantly increase. Neighboring West Germany, with a population ten times that of Switzerland (6.5 million), had only three times as many drug-related deaths in 1988. Not far from the Swiss National Museum in Zurich, the Platzspitz Park, once an ideal spot for picnics, has now become a gathering place for drug users. Switzerland's largest circulation newspaper, *Die Weltwoche*, exclaimed, "What's wrong with Switzerland? Are we too wealthy? Have our youth really lost their way?"

In search of solutions, a government-established committee suggested legalizing the possession and consumption of small amounts of drugs. The committee chairman, Lindt, said, "Punishing drug users for damaging their own bodies does not solve any problems. They need help." The Swiss Federal Council has yet to respond to this suggestion. Officials from Zurich's anti-drug department believe this proposal is "impossible and impractical." An official from Zurich's AIDS prevention organization also holds a different view. He believes that the drug problem is unsolvable. Instead, the urgent task is to control the spread of AIDS among Switzerland's 10,000 to 15,000 drug users. AIDS is highly likely to spread through the use of contaminated syringes.

According to the World Health Organization, Switzerland has 122.1 AIDS patients per million people, making it the country with the highest proportion of AIDS patients in Europe.

### 吸毒问题困扰瑞士

    吸毒问题困扰瑞士
    阿尔卑斯山的美景、精制手表和上等巧克力吸引着众多游人前往瑞士。谁曾想到，在这个连失业问题都不存在的富有国度里，今天最为恼人的问题却是青少年吸毒。
    瑞士已成为世界上按人口比例统计吸毒者最多的国家之一。去年，瑞士因吸毒死亡205人（1986年为136人），今年上半年的统计表明，这一数字将大幅度上升。与之相邻的联邦德国人口为瑞士人口（650万）的10倍，1988年因吸毒死亡人数仅为瑞士的3倍。离苏黎世国家博物馆不远的普拉茨施匹兹公园曾是人们野餐的理想场所，如今已成为吸毒者们的聚集地。瑞士发行量最大的《观察报》惊呼道：“瑞士出了什么毛病？我们太富有了吗？我们的青年真的迷失方向了吗？”
    为寻求解决办法，政府建立的一个专门委员会建议，使拥有及消费少量毒品合法化。该委员会主席林德说：“因吸毒者毁坏自己的身体而惩罚他们不解决任何问题。他们需要帮助。”瑞士联邦委员会还未答复这一建议。苏黎世警方反吸毒部门的官员认为，这种建议是“不可能和不切实际的”。苏黎世防治艾滋病机构的一位官员也持不同看法。他认为，吸毒问题无法解决。相反，当务之急是应控制瑞士1万至1.5万名吸毒者之中的艾滋病病毒。艾滋病极有可能通过使用带病毒的皮下注射针头而传染开来。
    据世界卫生组织统计，瑞士每百万人中艾滋病患者为122.1人，是欧洲艾滋病患者比例最高的国家。
