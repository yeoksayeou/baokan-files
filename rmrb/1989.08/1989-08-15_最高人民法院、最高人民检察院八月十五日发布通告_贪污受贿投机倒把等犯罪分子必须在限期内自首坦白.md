The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued a notice on August 15, stating that officials involved in embezzlement, bribery, and speculation must surrender and confess within the specified period.

Firmly punishing corruption and combating serious criminal activities such as embezzlement, bribery, and speculation in the economic field is an important task determined by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It is also a matter of great concern to the people. Serious economic criminal activities must be severely cracked down upon. In handling such cases, the principles of facts as the basis, law as the criterion, and equality before the law must be adhered to. The policy of combining punishment with leniency, being lenient to those who confess and strict to those who resist, must be strictly implemented. Anyone who violates the criminal law and constitutes a crime must be held accountable; anyone who surrenders and confesses within the specified period and performs meritorious service must be treated leniently.

To give criminals a chance to repent and reform, and to severely punish those who refuse to repent, according to the suggestions of the full meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held on July 27 and 28, 1989, and relevant legal provisions, the following notice is issued:

1. State functionaries who commit the crimes of embezzlement, bribery, and speculation, and the directly responsible persons and other directly responsible personnel of enterprises, institutions, organs, and groups who commit the crimes of speculation and bribery, must surrender to the procuratorial organs, public security organs, people's courts, or other relevant departments or their own units from the date of this notice until October 31, 1989, to confess and surrender their crimes, and seek lenient treatment.

2. Within the above-mentioned period, those who surrender and confess and actively return the illicit gains, or those who have meritorious service, shall be treated leniently according to the provisions of Article 63 and Article 59 of the Criminal Law. Among them, those whose crimes are particularly serious and who should be sentenced to death according to the law may be given a lighter or mitigated punishment and not sentenced to death; those whose crimes are relatively serious and who should be sentenced to heavy penalties according to the law may be given a lighter, mitigated punishment, or exempted from punishment; those whose crimes are relatively light and who should be sentenced to light penalties according to the law may be given a mitigated punishment or exempted from punishment.

Those who confess all their crimes after being subjected to compulsory measures and actively return the illicit gains, or those who have meritorious service, shall be treated leniently according to the above provisions.

3. Those who refuse to surrender and confess within the specified period; those who destroy evidence and transfer illicit funds and goods; those who collude with each other and form a defensive alliance; or those who flee to avoid punishment and refuse to surrender, shall be severely punished according to the law.

4. Anyone who knows or understands the circumstances of a crime has the duty to report it to the judicial organs or relevant departments. Those who report and expose crimes shall be protected according to the law. Those who report and expose crimes with meritorious service shall be rewarded.

Those who obstruct, threaten, or take revenge on law enforcement personnel and those who report and expose crimes shall be punished according to the provisions of Article 157 of the Criminal Law for obstructing public duties or Article 146 for revenge and entrapment, and shall be given heavier penalties.

Those who take the opportunity to fabricate facts and falsely accuse others shall be punished according to the provisions of Article 138 of the Criminal Law for false accusation and entrapment, and shall be given heavier penalties.

5. It is strictly forbidden to intercede, shield, or harbor criminals. Those who harbor or conceal criminals shall be punished according to the provisions of Article 162 of the Criminal Law for harboring and concealing crimes, and shall be given heavier penalties; those who hide, destroy evidence, or fabricate or produce false evidence for criminals shall be punished according to the provisions of Article 148 of the Criminal Law for false testimony, and shall be given heavier penalties.

6. This notice applies to other economic criminals outside the scope of Article 1 of this notice who surrender and confess, or report and perform meritorious service within the period specified in this notice.
