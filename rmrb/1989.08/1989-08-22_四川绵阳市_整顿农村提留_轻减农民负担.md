The Communist Party of China Mianyang Municipal Committee recently issued a notice requiring the rectification of village levies to effectively reduce farmers' burdens and accomplish several things that farmers will be happy about.

The Mianyang Municipal Committee, through investigation and research, concluded that the most prominent issue in rural areas at present is that farmers' burdens are too heavy, rural financial management is chaotic, levy items are numerous, and levy standards are increasingly high. Currently, farmers' burdens account for about 10% of their net income, far exceeding the standards set by the central government and exceeding farmers' bearing capacity. This has dampened farmers' enthusiasm, affecting the relationship between the Party and the government with the farmers. This rectification mainly aims to clear up levy items that violate policy regulations and various excessive levies. Focusing on the issue of reducing farmers' burdens, it clears up the behavior of arbitrarily imposing burdens on the grassroots level in rural areas and effectively corrects the erroneous practice of "layer-by-layer interception of benefits and layer-by-layer addition of burdens."

    四川绵阳市——整顿农村提留  轻减农民负担
    中共绵阳市委最近发出通知，要求整顿农村提留，切实减轻农民负担，办几件农民高兴的实事。
    绵阳市委通过调查研究认为，当前农村最突出的问题是，农民负担过重，农村财务管理混乱，提留项目繁多，提留标准愈来愈高。现在农民负担要占其纯收入的10％左右，大大超过了中央规定标准，超过农民的承受能力。这挫伤了农民的积极性，影响党和政府与农民的关系。这次整顿主要清理违背政策规定的提留项目和超限额的各种提留，围绕减轻农民负担这一问题，清理向农村基层乱摊派的行为，切实纠正那种“利益层层截留，负担层层加码”的错误做法。
