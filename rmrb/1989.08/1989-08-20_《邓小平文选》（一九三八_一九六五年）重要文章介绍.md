Introduction to Important Articles in "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" (1938-1965)

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Literature Editorial Committee has compiled "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" (1938-1965), which includes 39 important works by Comrade Deng Xiaoping from the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and the 17 years after the founding of the nation. The following is an introduction to the important articles:

"The Mobilization of New Recruits and Political Work Among New Soldiers" is the opening piece of this collection. Written in January 1938 by Deng Xiaoping when he was the Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army, the article states at the outset: "The final victory or defeat of the war will be determined in the course of a protracted resistance." The article emphasizes the need to mobilize as many people as possible to join the army to support the prolonged and arduous anti-Japanese war. It stresses the importance of political work in ensuring that new soldiers have high morale and initiative to march to the front lines, transforming ordinary civilians with strong family ties into skilled soldiers quickly.

"The Party and Anti-Japanese Democratic Governments" was published in April 1941. At the time, various levels of government in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Anti-Japanese Base Areas were about to be established. The article focuses on the relationship between the Party and the government, pointing out that the three-thirds system of government at the time was a joint dictatorship of several revolutionary classes against traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and reactionaries, and was the best form of government for the anti-Japanese struggle in the rear areas. Its essence is the democratic issue. The Party must uphold the spirit of democracy in leading government work. The Party's leadership responsibility lies in political principles, not in taking over everything. The article sharply criticizes the erroneous belief of some Party members that the Party's advantage is for Party members to take over everything, and that Party leadership means "Party power above all" or even "Party members above all." It points out that these erroneous ideas are a reflection of the Kuomintang's evil tradition of "rule by the Party" within our Party. The Party should adopt a policy of guidance and supervision over the government.

"Summary of Five Years of Struggle Against the Enemy" and "Organizational Work and Policy Implementation in Enemy-Occupied Areas" are two parts of a report made at the High-Level Cadres Conference of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Taihang Division in January 1943. At the time, the Anti-Japanese War was at its most difficult stage of stalemate. The report reviews the five years of intense and serious struggles against the enemy in North China, including military, political, economic, and cultural propaganda struggles. It summarizes ten very important experiences in the struggle against the enemy, pointing out that the struggle between the enemy and us is not just a competition of military strength, but a comprehensive struggle of all abilities, not just a struggle of strength, but more importantly, a struggle of intelligence. It is necessary to grasp the characteristics of a protracted war and the weakness of the enemy, to conceal and accumulate strength for a counterattack, to care about the people's problems, to protect the people's interests, and to win the support of the people in the enemy-occupied areas. All policies and work must start from firmly grasping the essence of the Sino-Japanese contradiction and developing the anti-Japanese national united front. Efforts should be made to build the base areas, adopt the policy of "advancing when the enemy advances" to seize the initiative in the struggle against the enemy, implement basic guerrilla warfare, and not relax mobile warfare under favorable conditions. The struggle in the rear areas should be used to influence the whole country and strive for unity and nation-building after the war. The report emphasizes that "every cadre in their work must carefully study the instructions of the Party Central Committee and higher authorities and apply them to their own work environment. This will become an important guarantee for overcoming serious difficulties, achieving victory in the war of resistance, and nation-building after the war."

"Economic Construction in the Taihang Area" was published in July 1943. At the time, the Japanese invaders implemented a policy of blockade and plunder in the anti-Japanese base areas, aiming to "destroy the survival of the resistance." The article determines that developing production is the foundation for breaking the enemy's blockade and building a self-sufficient economy, and that developing agriculture and handicrafts is the key to production. It emphasizes that "whoever has grain has everything." It also stipulates various specific policies for economic construction in the base areas. The article points out that under extremely difficult conditions in the rear areas, we have fought on the economic front. It is precisely because of this victory on the economic front that we have been able to persist in the resistance for six years in the rear areas and continue to persist.

"Speech at the Rectification Movement Mobilization Meeting of the North China Bureau Party School" was published in November 1943. At the time, the Taihang Area was carrying out the rectification movement. The article systematically expounds the purpose and significance of the rectification, pointing out the need to use proletarian Marxist-Leninist thought to overcome non-proletarian, non-Marxist-Leninist thought among our comrades. The article reviews the Party's historical experience, stating that after the Zunyi Conference, "the Party's cause has been completely under the guidance of Sinicized Marxism-Leninism, that is, Mao Zedong Thought, for nine years, and we have not made any mistakes, but have been developing victoriously." "Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee guided by Mao Zedong Thought, recalling the painful lessons of the past under opportunist leadership, every comrade will feel that these nine years have been very happy, and at the same time will feel more acutely the harm of the three incorrect tendencies."

"Victorious Situation in the Advance to Central China and Future Policies and Strategies" is a report made at the joint meeting of the Front and Rear Commissions of the Central Plains in Lu Mountain, Henan, in April 1948, during the turning point of the War of Liberation. The article points out that the Central Plains Field Army's advance from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, covering a thousand miles, has brought about a significant change in the strategic situation. The article states that the Central Plains battlefield "has attracted more than half of Chiang Kai-shek's forces in the south, ensuring the successful deployment of other regions. Although we have suffered the most and paid the price in the national scope, we have gained strategic initiative and achieved overall victory." It also states that the closer the revolution is to victory, the more arduous the struggle becomes. Those who yield to difficulties are not steadfast in the revolution. "True heroes are those who overcome difficulties, prepare to suffer, and bravely and resolutely fight across the Yangtze River." This article prominently reflects the author's strategic thinking of starting from the overall situation in the revolutionary struggle and the revolutionary spirit of daring to take on responsibilities, daring to struggle, and daring to win.

"Implementing the Central Committee's Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification" is an instruction drafted in June 1948 for the Central Plains Bureau by Deng Xiaoping, who was then the First Secretary of the Central Plains Bureau. Based on the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification, and starting from the actual situation in the Central Plains, he formulated a set of specific policies suitable for the new liberated areas for land reform and party rectification. This instruction was sent to the Central Committee, and Comrade Mao Zedong gave it a high evaluation and added two paragraphs. When Comrade Mao Zedong forwarded this document, he wrote in a letter to Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and others: "With this document from the Central Plains Bureau, the Central Committee does not need to issue such documents anymore."

"Several Opinions on Entering New Areas in the Future" is part of a comprehensive report written in August 1948 to the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. At that time, the War of Liberation had entered its third year, and new liberated areas were rapidly expanding, encountering many new problems in military operations, supply, social policies, and cadre preparation. Some of these problems had no experience in the period of internal war or the Anti-Japanese War. Based on the experience of work in new areas over the past year, Deng Xiaoping put forward several important opinions on entering new areas. The report proposes that in new areas, a military period must be experienced before entering a consolidation period. During the military period, the role of the government should be fully utilized, and propaganda work should be strengthened to concentrate the struggle on the most reactionary elements, unite the majority, stabilize public sentiment, and create a new atmosphere in the new areas.

"From Crossing the River to Occupying Shanghai" is part of a report made in August 1949 to the representatives of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference. Led by Deng Xiaoping as Secretary, the General Front Committee commanded the Second and Third Field Armies to successfully conclude the Huaihai Campaign and then launched the Jin-Hu-Hang Campaign, breaking through the Nationalist Party's carefully fortified Yangtze River defense line and liberating Nanjing, Shanghai, and the vast areas of Su, Zhe, Anhui, and Jiangxi. The report vividly introduces the situation of the river-crossing operation, pointing out that the victory of the river-crossing operation politically signifies the demise of the reactionary Nanjing government.

"Strategies for Work in the New Areas of Guizhou" is a telegram drafted in November 1949 for the Second Field Army Front Committee by Deng Xiaoping during the period when the People's Liberation Army advanced into the southwest. The telegram points out that it is not appropriate to propose the slogan of concentrating forces to strike the Central System (i.e., the forces planted and cultivated by Chiang Kai-shek in Guizhou) indiscriminately, as this may result in a broad front of attack. In fact, the vast majority of people in the Central System are wavering. The telegram requires that "upon entering the new area, attention should be paid to uniting all possible people, neutralizing all possible people, and splitting all possible people in the enemy camp, and this strategy should include the Central System." For the complex problems encountered after entering the cities, such as currency, price, wage issues, village grain borrowing issues, and public security issues, it is proposed to quickly convene representative meetings of all sectors to solve them.

"Report at the Southwest Region Newspaper Work Conference" was made in May 1950. The report points out that holding the pen is the main method of leadership. Publishing newspapers, broadcasting, and publishing periodicals, while closely linking with reality and closely combining with the central tasks, are more effective, broader, and have a much greater impact in implementing leadership intentions. It proposes: "To run a good newspaper, there are three conditions: combining with reality, connecting with the masses, and criticism and self-criticism. These three conditions cannot be achieved without leadership, otherwise the newspaper will have no power and easily become 'reporting everything heard.' Therefore, the premise of running a good newspaper is leadership." The thoughts discussed in this article still have practical significance today for strengthening the Party's leadership over news work.

"Overcoming Current Unhealthy Tendencies in the Southwest Party" is a report made in June 1950 at the Second Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China in Chongqing, which is actually a rectification mobilization report for the entire Southwest region. The article points out that the main erroneous tendencies in the Southwest Party are bureaucratism, especially commandism, as well as exclusivism in the united front and the developing tendency of degeneration and corruption. He says: "The root cause of these tendencies is that these comrades think that the revolution has been victorious, so they can sleep, be proud, enjoy themselves, and do not need to strive. This is very dangerous." He also says: "These tendencies also reflect that our Party's organizational life is poor, criticism and self-criticism are insufficient, especially among leading comrades." The purpose of rectification is to overcome these unhealthy tendencies. Can they be overcome? The article points out that in any revolutionary stage, there will always be some dregs that settle down. However, the vast majority of our comrades are good. Those who have been tainted with unhealthy work styles can, through serious criticism and self-criticism, change their thinking, correct their mistakes, and continue to advance.

"On the Minority Nationality Issues in the Southwest" is a speech made in July 1950 at a welcoming meeting for the Central Nationality Visiting Team to the Southwest. The article, starting from the reality that the Southwest region has the most minority nationalities and the most complex issues, proposes a series of principled opinions on doing a good job in nationality work. The article points out that the current central task of nationality work is to achieve unity and eliminate estrangement. Nationality work must not suffer from acute diseases. All aspects of political, economic, and cultural work must adhere to the principle of consulting with minority nationalities and must obtain the approval of the majority of them, especially the upper strata. In actual actions, strictly implement discipline and do not infringe upon their interests in the slightest. Reform within minority nationalities is necessary; without reform, the poverty of minority nationalities cannot be eliminated. However, this reform must be carried out only after the conditions within minority nationalities are ripe.

"The Six Principles of Financial Work" and "Local Financial Work Should Have a Global Perspective" are parts of a report and summary made at the National Conference of Financial Bureau Directors in January 1954. At the time, Deng Xiaoping was serving as Vice Premier and Minister of Finance. The report, in response to the unstable situation of national finances, proposes six principles for financial work. The purpose is to place national finances on a regular, stable, and reliable foundation, with the ability to cope with external threats and emergencies; to ensure the needs of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation; and to mobilize everyone to reduce expenditures and overcome waste. In the conference summary, the author emphasizes the relationship between the whole and the parts, the central and local governments, and the relationship between centralized and decentralized leadership. He points out that in these relationships, both are indispensable, but the former is the guiding principle. If there is a conflict, the latter should yield to the former. In short, small matters should yield to big matters.

"Pride and Self-Satisfaction Are the Great Enemies of Unity" is a speech made at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee on February 6, 1954. This plenary session exposed and criticized the activities of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi to split the Party and seize the highest power of the Party and the state. Deng Xiaoping's speech discusses how, after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, due to the great victories in all aspects of work, a sense of pride and self-satisfaction has grown among a considerable number of senior cadres in our Party. If this is not addressed, it will develop into a dangerous situation.

"Report on Amending the Party Constitution" is a report made at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on September 16, 1956. The report comprehensively and deeply discusses the issue of how a ruling party strengthens its own construction. It clearly points out that the position of a ruling party brings new tests to our Party. Generally speaking, the Party has withstood the test in the past seven years, but experience tells us that the position of a ruling party easily makes our comrades prone to bureaucratism, and the danger of becoming detached from reality and the masses has increased compared to the past. In addition to strengthening the ideological education of Party members, appropriate regulations should also be made in state institutions and Party institutions to strictly supervise the Party's organization and Party members from within the Party and from the masses and non-Party personnel. The report emphasizes the issue of the Party's mass line, the issue of democratic centralism and collective leadership, and the issue of Party unity and unity. This report is an important document on the construction of a ruling party and has had a wide influence both domestically and internationally.

"Marxism-Leninism Must Be Combined with China's Actual Situation" is a response to the first question raised by an international youth delegation during a meeting in November 1956. Deng Xiaoping said that the meaning or task of a Communist Party member in China, if expressed in general terms, is just two sentences: wholeheartedly serve the people, and regard the interests of the people as the highest criterion for every Party member. The goal is to achieve socialism and communism. The task of the Party is to gradually raise the awareness of Party members, so that they become genuine Communist Party members in thought and action. He said that the Seventh Congress established the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. This requires studying the characteristics of one's own country. To mechanically transplant foreign things without considering the characteristics of one's own country, this universal truth cannot be realized. This is the summary of our Party's historical experience.

"The Main Task Now Is to Build" is part of a report made at a cadre meeting in Xi'an on April 8, 1957. The report points out that since the basic completion of socialist transformation, the task of the revolution has also been basically completed. The main task now is to build. Building is more difficult than making a revolution, and on this issue, our entire Party is still a beginner, and our abilities are far from sufficient. He particularly emphasizes the need to build a poor and backward country into an advanced industrial socialist country with the ability to build thriftily. "If one does not understand how to build thriftily on a poor foundation, this country cannot be built well." The article criticizes some enterprises for being greedy for new and large things, engaging in formalism, and causing serious waste to the country. Deng Xiaoping proposes the guiding ideology in construction: one is to face the reality of the country, and the other is to face the needs of the masses. These thoughts still have guiding significance for our country's economic construction in the future.

"The Communist Party Must Accept Supervision" is also part of a report made at a cadre meeting in Xi'an on April 8, 1957. The article points out that "our Party is a ruling party with high prestige. A large number of our cadres are in leading positions. In China, who has the qualifications to make big mistakes? It is the Communist Party of China. The impact of making mistakes is also the greatest." Therefore, to lead well, the Party must constantly overcome subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, accept supervision, and expand the democratic life of the Party and the state. Supervision comes from three aspects: one is the Party's supervision; two is the masses' supervision; three is the supervision of democratic parties and non-partisan democrats. Whether the Communist Party has the qualifications to lead and whether it is qualified or not depends on the Party itself. "As long as the Party and Party members do not alienate the masses, as long as the Party and Party members accept supervision, as long as the Party and Party members learn humbly, as long as the Party and Party members continue to work and do ideological and political work, our Party will definitely be able to lead the construction of the state smoothly, just as it has led the revolution to victory in the past." This article has clear views and convincing reasoning, and has great practical and far-reaching significance for the construction of a ruling party.

"Correctly Propagating Mao Zedong Thought" is part of a speech made at the Central Committee's Tianjin Conference in March 1960. The article sharply criticizes the erroneous tendency of vulgarizing Mao Zedong Thought and separating Mao Zedong Thought from Marxism-Leninism. The article points out that the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very serious and principled issue and should not be vulgarized. When propagating Mao Zedong Thought, one must not forget the most fundamental thing, which is Marxism-Leninism. The article also mentions the issue of collective leadership, saying: Comrade Mao Zedong is the representative of our Party's collective leadership and the leader of our Party; his position and role are different from those of ordinary collective leadership members, but one must not separate Comrade Mao Zedong from the Party Central Committee because of this, and should regard Comrade Mao Zedong as a member of the Party's collective leadership, and speak of his role in our Party in a realistic manner. This speech shows the author's consistent attitude of adhering to principles and seeking truth from facts.

"Advocating In-Depth and Detailed Work" is a speech made in October 1961 when receiving all the comrades attending the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's work conference. At that time, the country was facing economic difficulties, and the influence of the bourgeoisie and social dregs had emerged. The speech calls on the Youth League organizations to do more work, especially in-depth and detailed work, during difficult times. The article points out that the work of the Youth League, after all, is to educate young people in communism. Young people should be educated to establish a great communist ideal, and even if they are poor, they should not have short spirits. The more difficult the times, the more they should have ambition. These thoughts should be widely and boldly propagated among the youth. This article has positive significance for doing a good job in youth work at present.

"Speech at the Enlarged Central Work Conference" was published on February 6, 1962. This is another historical document on the construction of a ruling party by Deng Xiaoping after the report on amending the Party Constitution at the Eighth Congress. The article proposes and discusses the advantages of our Party, the excellent traditions and styles formed by our Party over the past few decades, especially since the Zunyi Conference. At the same time, it points out that in recent years, the excellent traditions of our Party have been weakened, even seriously weakened, bringing great harm to our work. Many comrades are busy with specific work and do not often talk about Party issues and pay attention to Party building. The article emphasizes the issue of democratic centralism. It points out: without democracy, there is no centralism, and this centralism can only be truly and correctly realized on the basis of democracy. Without proletarian democracy and proletarian centralism, there is no socialism. Without centralized and unified leadership based on democracy, the Party has no combat effectiveness. To create a lively and vigorous political situation in our country, we must first create it within the Party. In short, "democratic centralism is the most fundamental system of the Party and the state" and "is a matter related to the fate of our Party and state." Deng Xiaoping's series of discussions on democratic centralism still have important guiding significance for our Party building today.

"Ways to Overcome Current Difficulties" is a speech made at the Central Committee's work conference in May 1962. At that time, the three years of economic difficulties had not yet passed, and this conference made the decision to fully implement the eight-character policy of adjustment, consolidation, enrichment, and improvement and to make a major adjustment to the national economy. Deng Xiaoping believes that to solve the current difficulties, two key links should be grasped: one is to reduce the urban population by 20 million, and the other is to strengthen the work of rural production teams. Deng Xiaoping particularly emphasizes the need to do a good job in the screening and rehabilitation of cadres, and proposes the "one-package solution" to quickly mobilize the enthusiasm of a large number of grassroots cadres.

"How to Restore Agricultural Production" is part of a speech made in July 1962. Deng Xiaoping believes that to overcome difficulties and achieve a fundamental improvement in financial and economic conditions, one should start with restoring agriculture. The policies for restoring agriculture are mainly two aspects: one is to mobilize the enthusiasm of the peasants for production, and the other is industrial support for agriculture. He said: "What form of production relations is the best? It seems that we should adopt such an attitude: whichever form can more easily and quickly restore and develop agricultural production in a certain place, we should adopt that form; whichever form the masses are willing to adopt, we should adopt that form, and make it legal." He points out that some practices should fully consider the different conditions and special circumstances of different regions and should not be too hasty in making decisions or easily implement national uniformity. He uses the vivid metaphor of "whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat" to illustrate this problem. He emphasizes that some practices should fully consider the different conditions and special circumstances of different regions and should not be too hasty in making decisions or easily implement national uniformity.

"Building a Mature and Combat-Ready Party" is an excerpt from two speeches made in 1965, which is the closing piece of this collection. The article points out that the formulation and implementation of correct strategies and tactics can only be done by each country's party based on its own specific situation. It is not easy for a party to become a mature party. "The core issue of a country's revolution is the party. Only with a good party can the revolution be led to victory. After the revolution's victory, building socialism also relies on a good party, otherwise the victory will not be solid."

    《邓小平文选》（一九三八—一九六五年）重要文章介绍
    新华社北京8月20日电　《邓小平文选》（1938—1965年）重要文章介绍
    中共中央文献编辑委员会编辑的《邓小平文选》（1938—1965年），收入了邓小平同志在抗日战争、解放战争以及建国后17年这三个历史时期的重要著作39篇。现将重要文章介绍如下：
    《动员新兵及新兵政治工作》是这本文选的开卷篇。这是1938年1月邓小平同志在担任八路军政治部副主任时所写的文章。当时，抗日战争开始还不久。文章一开头就指出：“战争的最后胜败，要在持久抗战中去解决。”文中着重要求利用一切可能动员广大民众加入军队，以支持长期艰苦的抗日战争；要从政治工作上保证新战士具有高度的热情和自动性开赴前线，使昨天还是一个有浓厚家庭观念的老百姓，很快成为军队中的熟练战士。
    《党与抗日民主政权》发表于1941年4月。当时晋冀鲁豫抗日根据地各级政府即将成立。文章着重论述了党与政权之间的关系。指出当时实行的三三制政权是几个革命阶级对汉奸、亲日派、反动派的联合专政，是敌后抗战最好的政权形式。它的实质是民主问题，党在领导政权工作时必须贯彻民主的精神。党的领导责任是放在政治原则上，而不是包办。文内尖锐地批评有些党员错误地以为党的优势就是党员包办，党的领导就是“党权高于一切”甚至“党员高于一切”。指出这些错误思想是国民党“以党治国”的恶劣传统在我们党内的反映，党对政权应该是采取指导与监督的政策。
    《五年来对敌斗争的概略总结》、《敌占区的组织工作与政策运用》是1943年1月在中共中央太行分局高级干部会议上所作报告的两个部分。当时抗日战争处于最困难的相持阶段。报告综述了五年来同敌人在华北进行的尖锐、严重的斗争，包括军事、政治、经济、文化宣传的斗争。总结出十条非常重要的对敌斗争经验，指出：敌我斗争不仅是军事力量的竞赛，而且是全副本领的斗争，不仅斗力，更主要的是斗智；要掌握住持久战与敌强我弱的特点，隐蔽积蓄力量，准备反攻；要关心人民的问题，保护人民利益，争取敌占区人民的支持；一切政策、一切工作的出发点，都必须紧紧掌握中日矛盾的实质，发展抗日民族统一战线；努力建设根据地；采取“敌进我进”的方针以争取对敌斗争的主动；实行基本的游击战，不放松有利条件下的运动战；以坚持敌后斗争去影响全国，争取战后团结建国。报告强调指出：“每一个干部在自己的工作中，对于党中央和上级的指示，必须精细地研究，并使之适用于自己的工作环境。这将成为今后克服严重困难，取得抗战胜利与战后建国的重要保障。”
    《太行区的经济建设》发表于1943年7月。当时日本侵略者对抗日根据地实行一面封锁一面掠夺的政策，目的在于“毁灭抗战生存力”。文章确定发展生产是打破敌人封锁、建设自给自足经济的基础，发展农业和手工业是生产的重心的方针。强调指出：“谁有了粮食，谁就有了一切。”并且规定了根据地经济建设的各项具体政策。文章指出，我们在敌后极端困难的条件下进行了经济战线的斗争，正因为有了这一经济战线的胜利，我们才能在敌后坚持抗战6年之久，并且还能继续坚持下去。
    《在北方局党校整风动员会上的讲话》发表于1943年11月。当时太行区正开展整风运动。文章系统地阐述了整风的目的和意义，指出要以无产阶级的马列主义的思想，去克服存在于我们同志中的非无产阶级的非马列主义的思想。文章回顾党的历史经验时说：遵义会议之后，“党的事业完全放在中国化的马列主义，即毛泽东思想的指导之下，直到现在已经9年的时间，不但没有犯过错误，而且一直是胜利地发展着”。“在以毛泽东思想为指导的党中央的领导之下，我们回忆起过去机会主义领导下的惨痛教训，每个同志都会感觉到这9年是很幸福的，同时也会更加感到三风不正对我们的毒害了。”
    《跃进中原的胜利形势与今后的政策策略》是解放战争处在转折时期的1948年4月在河南鲁山召开的豫陕鄂前委和后委联席会议上的报告。文中指出，中原野战军由黄河到长江跃进了一千里，使战略形势起了巨大变化。文章说：中原战场“吸引了蒋介石南线的一半以上的兵力，保证了其他地区的胜利展开。虽在全国范围吃苦头最多，付出了代价，但换取了战略上的主动，取得了全局的胜利”。又说：革命越接近胜利斗争越艰苦。屈服于困难的人就是革命不坚定的人。“真正的英雄，就是要克服困难，准备吃苦，准备勇敢坚决地打过长江。”这篇文章突出反映了作者在革命斗争中从全局出发的战略思想和勇挑重担、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。
    《贯彻执行中共中央关于土改与整党工作的指示》是1948年6月为中共中央中原局起草的指示。邓小平同志当时任中原局第一书记。他根据中央关于土改与整党工作的指示，从中原地区的实际出发，区别不同情况，制定了一整套适合新解放区的土改和整党工作的具体政策。这个指示报送中央，毛泽东同志给予了高度评价，并增写了两段文字。毛泽东同志转发这个文件时，在写给刘少奇、朱德、周恩来等同志的信中说：“有了中原局这个文件，中央就不需要再发这类文件了。”
    《关于今后进入新区的几点意见》是1948年8月写给中共中央和毛泽东同志的综合报告的一部分。这时，解放战争已进入第三年，新解放区迅速扩大，不论在作战、供应、社会政策以及干部准备等方面都遇到许多新的问题。其中有些问题，无论在内战时期或抗日战争时期，都没有经验。邓小平同志根据一年来新区工作的经验，提出了进入新区后的一些重要意见。报告提出，在新区必须经过一个军事时期然后才能进入巩固时期。在军事时期，应特别发挥政权的作用和加强宣传工作，将斗争对象集中于最反动的部分，团结大多数，以安定民心，造成新区的新气象。
    《从渡江到占领上海》是1949年8月向新政治协商会议筹备会代表所作的报告的一部分。以邓小平同志为书记的总前委，统率第二野战军和第三野战军胜利地结束淮海战役之后，又进行了京沪杭战役，一举突破国民党苦心经营的长江防线，解放了南京、上海及苏、浙、皖、赣等广大地区。报告生动地介绍了渡江作战的情况。指出渡江作战的胜利，在政治上表示了反动的南京政府的灭亡。
    《贵州新区工作的策略》是人民解放军挺进西南时期，在1949年11月为二野前委起草的给即将进入贵州新区的五兵团负责同志的电报。电报指出，不可笼统地提出集中力量打击中央系（即蒋介石在贵州安插和培植的势力）的口号，这样可能形成打击面过大的结果，事实上中央系中极大部分人都在动摇。电报要求：“在进入新区后，一开始就要注意团结一切可能团结的人，中立一切可能中立的人，分化敌人营垒中一切可能分化的人，这个策略应包括中央系在内。”对于进入城市后遇到的困难复杂的问题，如货币、物价、工资问题，乡村的借粮问题、治安问题等，提出要尽快召开各界代表会议来解决。
    《在西南区新闻工作会议上的报告》作于1950年5月。报告指出，拿笔杆是实行领导的主要方法。出报纸、办广播、出刊物，而又能做到密切联系实际，紧密结合中心任务，这在贯彻实现领导意图上，比其他方法更有效，更广泛，作用大得多。提出：“办好报纸有三个条件：结合实际、联系群众、批评与自我批评。这三条离开了领导也搞不好，报纸就没有力量，容易变成‘有闻必录’。所以办好报纸的前提在领导。”这篇文章论述的许多思想，在今天对于加强党对新闻工作的领导仍有现实意义。
    《克服目前西南党内的不良倾向》是1950年6月在中共重庆市第二次代表会议上的报告，实际上是整个西南地区的整风动员报告。文中指出，西南党内的主要错误倾向是官僚主义，特别是命令主义，还有统一战线中的关门主义，以及正在发展的蜕化腐朽思想。他说：“产生这些倾向的根源，是这些同志认为革命胜利了，可以睡觉了，可以骄傲了，应该享福了，不必努力了。这是非常危险的。”他又说：“这些倾向还表现了我们党的组织生活太差，批评与自我批评不够，特别是在领导同志中间。”整风的目的就是要克服这些不良倾向。能不能克服呢？文中指出，任何一个革命阶段，总有一些渣滓要沉下来。但是我们绝大多数同志的本质是好的。沾染不良作风的人，绝大多数经过认真开展批评与自我批评，是能够转变思想，纠正错误，继续前进的。
    《关于西南少数民族问题》是1950年7月在欢迎赴西南地区的中央民族访问团大会上的讲话。文章从西南地区少数民族最多、问题特别复杂这一实际情况出发，提出一系列关于做好民族工作的具有原则性的意见。文章指出，现在民族工作的中心任务是搞好团结，消除隔阂。民族工作一定不能患急性病。所有政治、经济、文化等一切方面的工作，都要掌握同少数民族商量的原则，一定要得到他们大多数人的赞成，特别是上层分子的赞成。在实际行动中严格执行纪律，不侵犯他们一丝一毫的利益。少数民族内部的改革是需要的，不改革，少数民族的贫困就不能消灭，但是这个改革必须等到少数民族内部的条件具备了以后才能进行。
    《财政工作的六条方针》、《地方财政工作要有全局观念》是1954年1月在全国财政厅局长会议上所作报告、总结的一部分。当时邓小平同志担任政务院副总理兼财政部长。报告针对国家财政不稳固的情况，提出财政工作的6条方针。目的是把国家财政放在经常的、稳固的、可靠的基础上，有力量应付外侮和应付万一；保证社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的需要；调动大家节减开支、克服浪费的积极性。在会议的总结中，作者着重阐述了全局与局部的关系、中央与地方的关系、集中统一与因地制宜的关系，指出在这些关系中，二者缺一不可，但是前者是主导，如果发生矛盾，后者应服从前者。一句话：小道理应该服从大道理。
    《骄傲自满是团结的大敌》是1954年2月6日在党的七届四中全会上的发言。这次全会揭露和批判了高岗、饶漱石阴谋分裂党篡夺党和国家最高权力的活动。邓小平同志的发言论述了新民主主义革命胜利以后，由于各方面工作的巨大胜利，在我们党内尤其是相当一部分高级干部中，滋长了骄傲自满情绪，如不注意克服，就会发展到危险的地步。
    《关于修改党的章程的报告》是1956年9月16日在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上的报告。报告全面深刻地论述了执政党如何加强自身建设的问题。明确指出，执政党的地位，使我们党面临着新的考验。过去7年，一般说来经受住了考验，但经验告诉我们，执政党的地位，很容易使我们同志沾染上官僚主义的习气，脱离实际和脱离群众的危险比过去增加了。为此，除了加强对党员的思想教育外，还要从国家制度和党的制度上作出适当的规定，以便从党的内部和来自群众与党外人士这两个方面对党的组织和党员实行严格的监督。报告着重讲了党的群众路线问题，党的民主集中制和集体领导问题，党的团结和统一问题等。这个报告是论述执政党建设的重要文献，在国内外产生了广泛的影响。
    《马列主义要与中国的实际情况相结合》是1956年11月会见国际青年代表团时对他们所提的第一个问题的回答。邓小平同志说，中国共产党员的含意或任务，如果用概括的语言来说，只有两句话：全心全意为人民服务，一切以人民利益作为每一个党员的最高准绳。他的目的是要实现社会主义、共产主义。党的任务是要一步一步地提高党员的觉悟，使他们在思想上行动上成为名副其实的共产党员。他说，党的七大确定了这样的原则，即马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合。这就必须研究本国的特点。离开本国的特点去硬搬外国的东西，这条普遍真理就不能实现。这是我们党历史经验的总结。
    《今后的主要任务是搞建设》是1957年4月8日在西安干部会上所作报告的一部分。报告指出，从社会主义改造基本完成时起，革命的任务也就基本上完成了，今后的主要任务是搞建设。搞建设比搞革命要困难一些，在这个问题上，我们全党还是小学生，本领差得很。他特别强调，要把我们这样一个贫穷落后的国家建设成为社会主义的先进的工业国家，需要有勤俭建国的本领。“如果在贫穷的基础上不懂得勤俭建国，这个国是建不好的。”文中批评了有些企业贪新贪大，搞形式主义，给国家造成严重浪费。邓小平同志提出在建设方面的指导思想，一是面对国家的现实，二是面对群众的需要。这些思想对今后我国的经济建设仍有指导意义。
    《共产党要接受监督》也是1957年4月8日在西安干部会上所作报告的一部分。文中指出，“我们党是执政的党，威信很高。我们大量的干部居于领导地位。在中国来说，谁有资格犯大错误？就是中国共产党。犯了错误影响也最大”。因此，党要领导得好，就要不断地克服主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，就要受监督，就要扩大党和国家的民主生活。监督来自三个方面：一是党的监督；二是群众的监督；三是民主党派和无党派民主人士的监督。共产党有没有资格领导，合格不合格，这决定于我们党自己。“只要党和党员不脱离群众，只要党和党员接受监督，只要党和党员虚心学习，只要党和党员不断地进行工作，进行思想政治工作，我们党就一定能同过去领导革命取得胜利一样，顺利地领导国家建设”。这篇文章观点鲜明，说理透彻，对执政党的建设具有重大的现实意义和长远意义。
    《正确地宣传毛泽东思想》是1960年3月在中共中央天津会议上讲话的一部分。文章尖锐地批评了把毛泽东思想庸俗化和把毛泽东思想同马克思列宁主义割裂开来的错误倾向。文中指出，对待毛泽东思想是一个很严肃的原则性的问题，不要庸俗化。在宣传毛泽东思想的时候，一定不要忘记了马克思列宁主义这个最根本的东西。文章还提到集体领导问题，说：毛泽东同志是我们党的集体领导的代表人，是我们党的领袖；他的地位和作用同一般的集体领导成员是不同的，但是切不可因此把毛泽东同志和党中央分开，应该把毛泽东同志看作是党的集体领导中的一个成员，把他在我们党里头的作用说得合乎实际。这篇讲话表明了作者一贯坚持原则、坚持实事求是的态度。
    《提倡深入细致的工作》是1961年10月在接见参加共青团中央工作会议的全体同志时的讲话。当时国家正面临经济困难，资产阶级的影响和社会渣滓的影响钻了出来。讲话号召团组织越是在困难的时候越要多做工作，越要做得深入细致。文中指出，共青团的工作，归根到底是要对青年进行共产主义教育。要教育青年树立共产主义的远大理想，人穷志不要短，越到困难的时候，越要有志气。要在青年里面广泛地、理直气壮地宣传这些思想，这篇文章对当前做好青年工作是有积极意义的。
    《在扩大的中央工作会议上的讲话》发表于1962年2月6日。这是继八大修改党章报告之后，邓小平同志在党的重要会议上论述执政党建设的又一篇历史性文献。文章提出和论述了我们党的优点，我们党几十年来，特别是遵义会议以来所形成的优良传统和优良作风。同时又指出最近几年党的优良传统受到了削弱甚至是严重的削弱，给我们的工作带来很大的危害。许多同志忙于具体工作，不大谈党的问题，不大注意党的建设。文章着重论述了民主集中制的问题。指出：没有民主就没有集中，而这个集中，总是要在民主的基础上，才能真正地正确地实现。没有无产阶级的民主和无产阶级的集中，也就没有社会主义。没有建立在民主基础上的集中统一，党就没有战斗力。要在我们的国家内造成生动活泼的政治局面，首先要从党内造成。总之，“民主集中制是党和国家的最根本的制度”，“是关系我们党和国家命运的事情”。邓小平同志关于民主集中制的一系列论述，对今天我们进行党的建设仍有重要的指导意义。
      《克服当前困难的办法》是1962年5月在中共中央工作会议上的讲话。当时三年经济困难时期还没有过去，这次会议作出了全面贯彻执行调整、巩固、充实、提高的八字方针和对国民经济进行大幅度调整的决策。邓小平同志认为，解决当前的困难应抓住两个中心环节，一是减少两千万城市人口，一是加强农村生产队的工作。邓小平同志特别强调做好干部的甄别平反工作，果断地提出“一揽子解决”的办法，以迅速调动广大基层干部的积极性。
      《怎样恢复农业生产》是1962年7月的一次讲话的一部分。邓小平同志认为，克服困难，争取财政经济状况的根本好转，要从恢复农业着手。恢复农业的政策主要是两个方面：一是把农民的生产积极性调动起来，一是工业支援农业。他说：“生产关系究竟以什么形式为最好，恐怕要采取这样一种态度，就是哪种形式在哪个地方能够比较容易比较快地恢复和发展农业生产，就采取哪种形式；群众愿意采取哪种形式，就应该采取哪种形式，不合法的使它合法起来。”他针对当时的情况，使用了“黄猫、黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”这一形象化的比喻，来说明这个问题。他强调有些做法应该充分地照顾不同地区的不同条件和特殊情况，不要太轻易下决心，不要轻易地实行全国统一。
    《建设一个成熟的有战斗力的党》是1965年两次谈话的节录，是这本文选的终卷篇。文中指出，制定和执行正确的战略和策略只能由各国党根据本国的具体情况自己来搞。一个党要成为成熟的党是不容易的。“一个国家的革命，核心问题是党。有了一个好党才能引导革命走向胜利。革命胜利后，搞社会主义也要靠一个好党，否则胜利就靠不住。”
