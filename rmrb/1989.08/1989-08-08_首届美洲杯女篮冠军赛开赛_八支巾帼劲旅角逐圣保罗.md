The first Americas Cup Women's Basketball Championship began this afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil's largest city.

The eight participating teams are: the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Argentina, and the host team, Brazil. The eight teams are divided into two groups, and they will first compete in a round-robin format within their groups. The top two teams from each group will advance to the semifinals. The first group consists of the United States, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Argentina. The second group includes Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Peru. Today, three matches were played: Canada defeated Peru 73-37, Brazil defeated Mexico 93-73, and Cuba defeated the Dominican Republic 96-39.

The top four teams from this tournament will represent the Americas in next year's World Women's Basketball Championship, which will be held in Malaysia. According to experts, the U.S. women's basketball team is superior to the other seven teams and is a strong contender for the championship. The teams from Cuba, Brazil, and Canada are of similar strength and are all considered world-class teams. The teams from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Peru are relatively weaker and are unlikely to make it into the top four.

    首届美洲杯女篮冠军赛开赛
    八支巾帼劲旅角逐圣保罗
    新华社巴西利亚8月6日电　第一届美洲杯女篮冠军赛今天下午在巴西最大城市圣保罗拉开战幕。
    参赛的8支女篮劲旅是：美国、加拿大、墨西哥、古巴、多米尼加共和国、秘鲁、阿根廷和东道主巴西队。8个队分为两组，先进行小组循环赛，获小组前两名的队进入半决赛。第一组由美国、古巴、多米尼加共和国和阿根廷队组成，第二组有巴西、加拿大、墨西哥和秘鲁队。今天共进行3场比赛，加拿大队在首场比赛中以73∶37的悬殊比分战胜秘鲁队，巴西队以93∶73击败墨西哥队，古巴队以96∶39轻取多米尼加共和国队。
    本届比赛的前四名将代表美洲地区参加明年在马来西亚举行的世界女篮冠军赛。据行家分析，美国女篮水平在其他7支球队之上，是本届比赛冠军的有力竞争者；古巴、巴西和加拿大三支球队水平接近，都属世界强队；墨西哥、多米尼加共和国和秘鲁队水平较差，难以进入前四名。
