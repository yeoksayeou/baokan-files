On the map of our motherland, Shandong Province, with its 153,000 square kilometers of land and over 3,000 kilometers of coastline, is like a great phoenix lying in wait. Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, and Weifang cities form its head, neck, and chest, reaching out into the sea. The central and western parts of Shandong are its belly, back, and tail, stretching deep into the heart of the country.

After the founding of New China in 1949, this great phoenix awoke from its slumber and prepared to take flight. In the 29 years leading up to 1978, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased from over 2.9 billion yuan to 39.9 billion yuan. However, it was only after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee that it truly spread its wings. In the following decade, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value soared to 150.3 billion yuan, achieving the first doubling three years ahead of schedule.

In its own history, Shandong's economy undoubtedly experienced a historic leap. However, the leading comrades of the provincial Party committee and government paid more attention to comparing Shandong's economy with the national economic landscape. When comparing comprehensive economic indicators such as total industrial and agricultural output value, gross national product, and national income, Shandong ranks among the top in the country. But with its large population, when comparing per capita figures, its ranking drops significantly, placing it only in the middle of the national rankings. This is clearly not in line with a resource-rich coastal province with a strong industrial and agricultural foundation. The comparison revealed the gap and the urgency. How can Shandong's economy advance to new heights? The main leaders of the provincial Party committee and government have been exploring this question from a strategic perspective.

In the spring of 1988, the central government made major decisions to expand the opening up of coastal areas and to develop the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Shandong's 44 counties (cities, districts) in the east were included in the Shandong Peninsula Open Area, and 83 counties (cities, districts) in the west were included in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain Development Area. The central government's decisions brought clarity to the provincial Party committee and government leaders. Implementing the coastal economic development strategy would add luster to the east; the development of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain would also inject new vitality into the western economy. Combining the two, using opening up to drive development and using development to promote opening up, achieving mutual complementarity between the east and west, and integrating them like gems and jades, would yield overall benefits. Based on this, the provincial Party committee and government clearly proposed the Shandong economic development strategy of "eastern opening up, western development, east-west integration, and common development."

"Following the current downstream is easy to reach." Because the economic development strategy aligns with Shandong's reality, despite the short implementation time, it has already achieved gratifying results. In the eastern region, leveraging the advantages of opening up, external-oriented economies are vigorously developed. "Three types of enterprises" and "three-in-one compensation" projects are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain, flourishing in coastal cities and towns. Many factories and enterprises, through "grafting" foreign capital and introducing technology, have undergone technological transformations, reaching international standards of the 1980s. Among the 44 counties (cities, districts) in the open area, 20 have already exceeded 100 million yuan in annual export commodity procurement value. The investment environment is increasingly improved, and the Qingdao and Yantai economic and technological development zones have entered a stage of rapid development. By the end of June this year, the Shandong Peninsula Open Area had cumulatively approved 323 "three types of enterprise" projects, with a total contracted foreign capital of 442 million US dollars.

Complementing the eastern opening up is the development wave sweeping across the western plains. Comrades in the western region see the coastal opening up and the development of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain as a rare double opportunity. On one hand, they implement comprehensive investments in funds, policies, and science and technology, and comprehensive development in production processing and commodity circulation. On the other hand, they proactively seek out opportunities to bring in foreign capital and advanced technology through the eastern region's open windows, and promote local products to the outside world. Implementing this strategy for just a short year has yielded encouraging results. By May this year, the western region of Shandong had invested 140 million yuan in development funds, completed 367 development projects, and increased wheat production by 2.68 billion kilograms this summer due to development measures, with a total income of 330 million yuan, including increased meat, eggs, and fish.

The symphony of opening up and development has brought a new pattern to Shandong's economic development. East-west dialogue and mutual complementarity have transitioned from leadership decisions and guidance to the conscious actions of various levels of government, economic departments, and enterprises, each opening their "city gates" and "fortress gates" to welcome each other. Various forms of paired support, economic cooperation, material coordination, technological alliances, and information exchange have opened countless channels between the eastern and western regions. Advanced technology, management experience, talent, and capital from the east are being introduced in large quantities to the west, while energy and raw materials from the west are continuously flowing into the eastern coastal cities. The traditional labor-intensive export products of the eastern region, such as spinning, embroidery, grass weaving, and carpets, are being rapidly transferred to the west, leveraging the advantages of abundant labor and rich resources in the western region. In 1988, the export commodity procurement value of the western region increased by 2.63 times compared to 1984.

The implementation of this new strategy in Shandong is essentially accelerating the rational allocation of production factors and the rational layout of productive forces across the province. The comprehensive benefits it will bring are difficult to quantify. However, it can be affirmed that through the implementation of this strategy, this great phoenix of Shandong will ride the winds of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and take flight.

    优势互补珠联璧合
    ——山东省实施东部开放、西部开发经济发展战略综述
    李芳木　许严刚
    在祖国的版图上，拥有153000平方公里土地、3000多公里海岸线的山东，就像一只伏卧的大鹏。青岛、烟台、威海、潍坊等市组成了它的头、颈、前胸，探入大海；而鲁中、鲁西则是它的腹、背、尾椎，深入祖国腹地。
    1949年新中国建立后，这只大鹏从沉睡中醒来，展翅欲飞。到1978年的29年间，全省工农业总产值由29亿多元增加到399亿元。而它真正展开翅膀，是在党的十一届三中全会之后。10年间，全省工农业总产值跃为1503亿元，提前3年超额实现了第一个翻番。
    在自己的历史上作纵向比较，山东经济无疑经历了一次历史性的飞跃。然而，省委、省政府的领导同志更看重把山东放在全国的经济大局中作横向比较。对比工农业总产值、国民生产总值、国民收入等综合性经济指标的绝对数值，山东在全国名列前茅；但山东人口众多，对比人均占有量，位次则大大退后，仅居全国中游。这显然与一个资源丰富、具有良好工农业基础的沿海省份很不相称。横比，比出了差距，比出了紧迫感。山东经济怎样向新的高度迈进？省委、省政府主要领导同志一直在从战略高度上探讨这个问题。
    1988年春天，中央先后作出沿海地区扩大对外开放和黄淮海平原开发的重大决策。山东省东部44个县（市、区）被列入山东半岛开放区，西部83个县（市、区）被列入黄淮海平原开发区。中央的决策，使省委、省政府领导豁然开朗。实施沿海地区经济发展战略，会使东部锦上添花；黄淮海开发也必将给西部经济发展注入新的活力。而把两者结合起来，以开放带动开发，以开发促进开放，实现东西部优势互补，珠联璧合，就能取得整体效益。据此，省委、省政府把“东部开放，西部开发，东西结合，共同发展”的山东经济发展战略明确提了出来。
    “循流而下易以至”。由于经济发展战略符合山东实际，尽管实施时间很短，已经取得可喜的成果。东部地区，凭借开放的优势，放手发展外向型经济。“三资”企业、“三来一补”项目如雨后春笋，在沿海城乡兴起。一大批工厂企业通过“嫁接”外资、引进技术，技术装备脱胎换骨，达到80年代国际水平。开放区44个县（市、区）中，已有20个县（市、区）年出口商品收购额超过亿元。投资环境日益完善，青岛、烟台两个经济技术开发区已经由起步阶段进入大踏步发展时期。到今年6月底，山东半岛开放区已经累计批准“三资”企业项目323个，合同外资金额达4.42亿美元。
    与东部开放相辅相承的是，开发大潮涌遍鲁西平原。西部地区的同志把沿海开放和黄淮海平原开发看成是千载难逢的双重机遇，一方面，实行资金、政策、科学技术综合投入，生产加工、商品流通综合开发；另一方面，主动出击，利用东部地区的开放窗口把外资和先进技术引进来，让本地的产品打出去。实施这一战略才短短一年时间，成果就令人鼓舞。截至今年5月，山东西部地区共投入开发资金1.4亿元，完成开发项目367个，今年夏季因开发措施而增产小麦26.8亿公斤，加上增产的肉、蛋、鱼类，收益达3.3亿元。
    开放与开发的协奏曲带来了山东经济发展的新格局。东西对话、优势互补已经由领导层的决策、引导，变为各级政府、经济部门、工厂企业的自觉行动，各自打开“城门”、“寨门”欢迎对方。各种形式的对口支援、经济联合、物资协作、技术联姻、信息交流，在东西部地区之间通开了无数条渠道，东部的先进技术、管理经验、人才、资金，大量引入西部，而西部的能源、原材料则源源不断地输入东部各沿海城市。东部地区传统的抽纱、刺绣、草编、地毯等劳动密集型出口产品的加工，正在加速向西转移，发挥了西部地区劳动力众多、资源丰富的优势。1988年，西部地区的出口商品收购额比1984年增长2.63倍。
    山东这一新战略的实施，实际上是在全省范围内加快实现生产要素的合理配置和生产力的合理布局。它所产生的综合效益到底会有多大，人们还难以估量。但可以肯定，通过实施这项战略，山东这只大鹏将乘着党的十三届四中全会的东风振翼腾飞。
