The political turmoil that occurred in the capital during the spring and summer and spread nationwide has sharply reminded people to pay attention to the issue of public opinion guidance, and has also led to serious reflection among the broad ranks of journalists.

It is well known that the political turmoil and counterrevolutionary riot initiated by a small number of people began with the creation of anti-Party and anti-socialist public opinion. They raised the banner of "press freedom," using various means such as distorting facts, spreading rumors, and inciting and provoking, to launch an attack on the Party and the people. In this struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the state, some leaders of the Party Central Committee, due to long-term indulgence, encouragement, and support for bourgeois liberalization, regarded the erroneous public opinion created by a small number of people as the "will of the people at home" and the "international progressive trend," directing the media to loosen restrictions and manipulate public opinion, thereby exacerbating the situation. For a period of time, the erroneous guidance of public opinion played a role in worsening the situation. The mistakes in public opinion guidance during this turmoil show that once newspapers, radio, television, and other public opinion tools are used to propagate erroneous political propositions and ideological viewpoints, they will cause political chaos, making some people mistakenly believe that this is the "voice of the Party Central Committee," leading to confusion and bewilderment in their thoughts, and also providing an opportunity for those with ulterior motives to peddle false goods. This profound lesson is worth serious reflection and learning, especially by those on the journalism front.

Public opinion is the views of people or social groups with similar economic status and political attitudes on a certain situation, and is a spiritual force that has a great impact on society. Correct, positive, and revolutionary public opinion has a great promotional effect on social progress; while erroneous, negative, and counterrevolutionary public opinion will hinder and destroy social stability and development. The different roles played by different public opinions in people's thoughts and behaviors during this turmoil once again fully prove this point.

The news industry plays an irreplaceable role in guiding social public opinion. Newspapers, news agencies, radio, and television have the most extensive audience, the longest reach, the fastest transmission, and the widest influence. These mass media, through reporting and commenting on facts, propagate certain viewpoints every day and every moment, and have a strong penetrative power in a subtle and imperceptible way. Therefore, any country, class, party, or social force must use news media to expand and strengthen public opinion that is beneficial to itself, suppress and oppose public opinion that is not beneficial to itself, and strive to make its ideological propositions gradually accepted by people, becoming the mainstream of social public opinion, thereby achieving effective social control. Every country regards guiding public opinion as a means of social control. Western societies regard public opinion as the fourth power after legislation, administration, and judiciary, and regard news tools as an important factor in controlling people's political behavior. The spokesmen of monopolistic capitalists do not hesitate to say: "Using one dollar in propaganda is equivalent to using five dollars in national defense."

Our country's news and public opinion tools belong to the people, and the news industry is a part of the overall socialist cause. Currently, the total circulation of various newspapers in our country reaches 150 million copies, and more than 80% of the population can obtain information in a timely manner through various news media. The news industry plays a very important role in our country's political, economic, and social life. Our news media are responsible for propagating the Party and the state's line, principles, and policies, and for maintaining close ties between the Party and the masses. They must firmly uphold the correct political direction, actively and effectively guide social public opinion, and mobilize and organize the people of all ethnic groups across the country to engage in the great cause of construction and reform. This is determined by the nature of the socialist news industry and is also the glorious duty of news workers.

Does emphasizing public opinion guidance impede press freedom? Generally speaking, press freedom, including freedom of publication and freedom of speech, is a democratic right realized through news transmission tools. Like other democratic and free rights, press freedom is concrete, not abstract. In class society, there has never been a class-transcending press freedom. Whichever class holds the news tools will inevitably reflect the interests of that class. In capitalist countries, newspapers often attack each other, and there is a lot of noise between newspapers and the government, giving the appearance of press freedom. In essence, this is just a manifestation of the struggle between various interests in public opinion on the premise of not endangering the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie. Like other democratic and free rights, press freedom is relative, not absolute. Press freedom must be regulated and constrained by law. The French "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" stipulates that while citizens enjoy freedom of speech and publication, they must be within the constraints of the law and bear the responsibility for abusing freedom. The United States, which always advocates press freedom, also imposes a series of restrictions on press freedom in its laws, such as "not disturbing social order," "not contempt of court," "not defaming and slandering others," and so on. The "Draft International Convention on Freedom of Information" adopted by the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information in 1948 clearly points out that anyone who discloses state secrets in news, endangers national security, incites others to change the government system by violence or disturb public order, or incites people to commit crimes, should be punished by law.

Socialist press freedom is fundamentally different from capitalist press freedom. Under the socialist system, the news industry is freed from the shackles of capital, providing material guarantees for the people to enjoy press freedom. The masses can use the news tools in accordance with the law to fully express various suggestions, criticisms, and opinions, exercise public opinion supervision over state affairs and social affairs, and exercise the right to be the masters of the country. This is completely different from the "press freedom" in capitalist countries where a few people monopolize and manipulate the news tools to maintain the bourgeoisie's rule over the broad masses of laboring people. At the same time, since our country is a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the fundamental interests of the people are completely consistent, which determines that there should be and can be a unified public opinion on political principles, political direction, and major issues. This uniformity of public opinion is a manifestation of the common will and aspirations of the people. Under the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, adhering to reform and opening up, and opposing bourgeois liberalization, it is universal and constant for public opinion among the people to be non-uniform. Through the discussion of various opinions, a unified understanding of thoughts is reached, making public opinion tend to be uniform. Through the cyclical movement of the contradiction between non-uniform public opinion and uniform public opinion, the thoughts and attention of the masses are guided to the track that is beneficial to social progress, promoting the continuous advancement of the cause of reform and construction. Whether it is the uniformity of public opinion based on the consistency of fundamental interests or the uniformity of public opinion formed by the people through democratic methods of self-education, this is unimaginable in capitalist countries. As socialist news workers, we must draw a clear line between bourgeois press freedom and socialist press freedom in both understanding and practice, and properly handle the relationship between press freedom and public opinion guidance. While exercising the right to press freedom, we must never forget the social responsibility of correctly guiding public opinion. Only in this way can we better shoulder the historical mission bestowed by the times and the people.

Of course, the development of socialist press freedom is inseparable from the development of the social economy, the construction of democratic politics, and the improvement of the people's ideological and cultural level. News reform is an important part of our country's political system reform. Currently, our news work has not been well integrated into the track of democracy and the rule of law, and there are still many problems in the management system of the news industry, and the quality of the news team needs to be improved. Adhering to the principles of promoting democracy and improving the legal system, developing socialist press freedom, is an urgent task facing us.

    试析舆论导向和新闻自由
    郗炽
    春夏之交发生在首都并波及全国的政治动乱，以极大的尖锐性提醒了人们对舆论导向问题的关注，也引起了广大新闻工作者的严肃反思。
    众所周知，极少数人掀起的这场政治动乱和反革命暴乱，首先是从制造反党反社会主义的舆论开始的。他们打出“新闻自由”的旗子，采用颠倒黑白、造谣诬蔑、蛊惑煽动等各种手段，向党和人民发起进攻。在这场关系到党和国家命运的斗争中，党中央的个别领导人由于长期纵容、鼓励和支持资产阶级自由化，把极少数人制造的错误舆论说成是“国内人心所向”和“国际进步潮流”，指使给新闻界松绑，策动舆论，扩大事态。一段时间里，错误的舆论导向对局势的恶化起了推波助澜的作用。这次动乱中舆论导向上的错误说明，报纸、广播、电视等舆论工具一旦被用来宣传错误的政治主张和思想观点，就会在政治上造成混乱，使一些群众误以为这就是“党中央的声音”，引起思想上迷惘和困惑，同时也给那些别有用心的人叫卖假货以可乘之机。这个深刻教训，很值得人们特别是新闻战线上的同志认真总结和汲取。
    舆论是社会上经济地位和政治态度相近的人们或社会集团对某一事态相近的看法，是一种对社会产生巨大影响的精神力量。正确的、积极的、革命的舆论对社会进步有很大的促进作用；而错误的、消极的、反革命的舆论则会阻碍和破坏社会的安定和发展。这次动乱中不同的舆论对人们的思想和行为各自所起的特殊作用，再一次充分地证明了这一点。
    新闻事业在引导社会舆论方面，有着其他舆论手段无法比拟的作用。报刊、通讯社、广播、电视等新闻媒介受众最多，射程最长，传播最快，影响最广。这些大众传播媒介通过报道和评价事实，每日每时都在宣传一定的观点，在潜移默化中具有很强的渗透力。所以，任何一个国家、阶级、政党和社会势力，都要借助新闻媒介，扩大和强化有利于自己的舆论，抑制和反对不利于自己的舆论，力图使自己的思想主张逐渐被人们所接受，成为社会舆论的主流，从而实现有效的社会控制。任何国家都把引导舆论作为社会控制的一种手段。西方社会把舆论视为仅次于立法、行政、司法的第四种力量，把新闻工具作为控制人们的政治行为的重要因素。垄断财团的代言人毫不讳言：“在宣传上使用一美元，等于在国防上使用五美元”。
    我国的新闻舆论工具属于人民所有，新闻事业是社会主义总的事业的一部分。目前，我国各类报刊的发行总量达1亿5千多万份，全国80％以上的人能够通过各种新闻媒介及时获得信息，新闻事业在我国政治、经济和社会生活中起着十分重要的作用。我们的新闻媒介担负着宣传党和国家的路线、方针、政策，密切党和群众联系的重任，必须旗帜鲜明地坚持正确的政治方向，积极而有效地引导社会舆论，动员、组织全国各族人民投身于建设和改革的宏伟事业。这是社会主义新闻事业的性质所决定的，也是我们新闻工作者的光荣职责。
    强调舆论导向是否会妨碍新闻自由？一般而言，新闻自由，包括出版自由和言论自由，是通过新闻传播工具实现的一种民主权利。和其它的民主、自由权利一样，新闻自由是具体的，而不是抽象的。在阶级社会中，从来没有超阶级的新闻自由。新闻工具掌握在哪个阶级手里，就必然反映那个阶级的利益。资本主义国家，报系之间以及报系和政府之间时常互相攻讦，吵吵嚷嚷，给人以新闻自由的假象，究其实质来说，这不过是在不危及资产阶级根本利益的前提下，各派利益互相争斗在舆论上的表现。和其它的民主、自由权利一样，新闻自由又是相对的，而不是绝对的。新闻自由总要受法律的规范和约束。法国的《人权宣言》就规定，公民在享有言论、出版自由的同时，必须在法律的限制内，承担滥用自由的责任。一向标榜新闻自由的美国就在法律中对新闻自由作了一系列的限制，如“不得扰乱社会”、“不得藐视法庭”、“不得诽谤和诋毁他人”等等。1948年联合国新闻自由会议通过的《国际新闻自由公约草案》明确指出，凡在新闻中泄露国家机密、危害国家安全者，意图煽动他人以暴力变动政府制度或扰乱治安者，意图煽惑人民犯罪者，均应依法予以惩罚。
    社会主义的新闻自由和资本主义的新闻自由有着本质的不同。在社会主义制度下，新闻摆脱了资本的奴役，为人民享有新闻自由权利提供了物质的保证。人民群众可以依法运用新闻工具充分发表各种建议、批评和意见，对国家事务和社会事务实施舆论监督，行使当家做主的权利。这和资本主义国家少数人垄断和操纵新闻工具，维护资产阶级对广大劳动人民统治的“新闻自由”有天渊之别。同时，由于我国是中国共产党领导下的社会主义国家，人民的根本利益是完全一致的，这就决定了在政治原则、政治方向和重大问题上应当而且能够有一致的舆论。这种舆论一律，是人民共同的意志和愿望的体现。在坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放、反对资产阶级自由化的大前提下，人民内部的舆论不一律又是普遍的、经常的。通过各种意见的讨论，达到思想认识的统一，使舆论趋于一律。通过舆论不一律和舆论一律的循环往复的矛盾运动，把群众的思想和注意力引导到有利于社会进步的轨道上来，推动改革和建设事业不断前进。无论是在根本利益一致基础上的舆论一律，还是通过人民用民主的方法进行自我教育形成舆论一律，这在资本主义国家都是不可想象的。作为社会主义的新闻工作者，必须从认识上到实践上划清资产阶级新闻自由同社会主义新闻自由的界限，妥当地处理新闻自由与舆论导向的关系。在行使新闻自由权利的同时，任何时候都不能淡忘正确引导舆论的社会责任。只有这样，才能更好地担负起时代和人民赋予的历史使命。
    当然，社会主义新闻自由的发展是和社会经济的发展、民主政治的建设以及人民思想文化水平的提高分不开的。新闻改革是我国政治体制改革的重要组成部分。目前，我国新闻工作还没有很好地纳入民主与法制的轨道，新闻事业的管理体制还存在不少问题，新闻队伍的素质还有待提高。遵循发扬民主、健全法制的原则，发展社会主义的新闻自由，是摆在我们面前的一项迫切任务。
