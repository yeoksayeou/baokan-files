Japanese friendship activist Yoshimura Sunzaburo passed away yesterday afternoon in Kyoto City due to illness. He was 105 years old.

After the end of World War II, Yoshimura actively advocated for the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, calling for the establishment of the Japan External Trade Organization to promote trade with China and worked tirelessly for this cause. He was the first vice president of the Japan External Trade Organization and later served as an advisor to the organization.

Yoshimura had a good relationship with our country's senior leaders such as Zhou Enlai. In 1979, he oversaw the establishment of the Zhou Enlai Premier Memorial Stone in Kyoto's Arashiyama. This stone has become a symbol of Sino-Japanese friendship.

    新华社东京8月4日电　多年来一直致力于中日友好活动的吉村孙三郎先生昨天下午因病在京都市逝世，享年105岁。
    第二次世界大战结束后，吉村先生积极主张恢复日中贸易，呼吁成立日本国际贸易促进协会开展与中国之间的贸易，并为此而努力。吉村是日本国际贸易促进协会的首任副会长，后来一直担任该协会顾问。
    吉村先生与周恩来等我国老一辈领导人有着良好关系。1979年，他主持建立了京都岚山周恩来总理纪念诗碑。这座诗碑已成为中日人民友好的一个象征。
