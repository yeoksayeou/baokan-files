The Chinese people, who have achieved decisive victories in suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion, are now stepping into the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation with joyful hearts and vigorous strides.

Looking back at the battles we have fought, we sincerely feel that these 40 years have been a time of pride and dignity for the Chinese people, a time of national strength and rejuvenation, and ultimately, a time of the triumph of socialism across the land. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of Shandong have raised the banner of socialism, restored the land, and transformed the old face of the land of Qi and Lu.

People will not forget that thousands of years of feudal society, more than a hundred years of imperialist aggression, and several decades of corrupt rule by the Kuomintang left the Chinese people with humiliation, poverty, and disaster. Before liberation, the land of Shandong was riddled with wounds and the people were in dire straits. After 40 years of reconstruction and development, today's Shandong, from cities to villages, presents a prosperous scene of thriving industries, harmonious governance, and people living and working in peace and contentment.

Over the past 40 years, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Shandong's overall economic strength has greatly increased. Compared to 1949, the province's total social output value has increased by 41 times, national income by 23 times, and the total industrial and agricultural output value by 38 times. In the past 10 years, Shandong has seen the fastest development of productive forces, rapid progress in various social undertakings, and the greatest benefits for the people. In just 6 years, the problem of food and clothing, which had not been solved for generations, was basically resolved. In 7 years, the first economic doubling was achieved. People's enthusiasm for reform and opening up and building modernization has reached an unprecedented height, and their spiritual outlook has been greatly improved. Such a long period of high-efficiency and high-speed development of the economy and social undertakings is unprecedented in old China and even makes contemporary developed capitalist countries envious.

Over the past 40 years, Shandong's agricultural production has increased significantly. In 1988, compared to 1949, grain yield per unit area increased from 53 kilograms to over 260 kilograms, total production from 8.7 million tons to 32.25 million tons, cotton from 800,000 tons to 1.13 million tons, peanuts from 540,000 tons to 1.94 million tons, and meat, aquatic products, and fruits have also increased several times or even tens of times. Farmers' lives are moving towards affluence and a moderately prosperous society.

Over the past 40 years, Shandong has formed a relatively complete industrial system with a reasonable structure and layout. The petroleum industry has gone from nonexistent to the establishment of an oil field producing 33 million tons of crude oil annually; before liberation, there were "no weapons," but now iron production has reached 2.48 million tons and steel 1.91 million tons; in 1988, the annual coal production was 32 times that of 1949; the annual power generation increased by 138 times. A number of large-scale chemical, mechanical, electronic, and light textile industries have been built and put into operation in recent years. Township and village enterprises are widespread, and their output value accounts for one-third of the total industrial output value, equivalent to 61 times the total industrial output value of the province in 1949. The province has formed a comprehensive transportation network connecting land, sea, and air, with roads reaching every corner of the province. The passenger and freight volumes have increased by 30 times and 71 times respectively compared to 40 years ago.

Over the past 40 years, Shandong's foreign trade has continued to expand, establishing trade relations with more than 150 countries and regions, with the total export volume increasing by 84 times compared to the early days of the founding of the nation, mainly achieved through reform and opening up. The overall development of foreign economic and trade cooperation, technology exchange, and exchanges is promising and has a broad prospect.

Over the past 40 years, Shandong's science, education, health, and sports undertakings have flourished. In the early days of the founding of the nation, the province had very few scientific research institutions and personnel, but now it has formed a relatively complete scientific research system. In the past 10 years, more than 10,000 important scientific and technological achievements have been made, accounting for 85% of the total since the founding of the nation. In old China, more than 80% of Shandong's population was illiterate, but now the province has 52 institutions of higher learning; the enrollment rate of school-age children has increased from 20% to 98.4%. In the era when the Chinese were called the "Sick Man of East Asia," the average life expectancy in Shandong was only 35 years; now, diseases such as smallpox, plague, and typhoid have been basically eradicated, and the average life expectancy has reached 71 years, with a significant improvement in health levels.

The development of the past 40 years has shown that socialism shines brightly on the ancient land of Qi and Lu. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; only socialism can save and revitalize China. This is the voice of the people and the conclusion of history. The claim that "the attempt and failure of socialism is a great legacy of the 20th century" is absurd and not worth refuting. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics on 9.6 million square kilometers of land is unprecedented, and it is inevitable that some setbacks and mistakes will occur. However, the mistakes made during the progress are all corrected by the Communist Party of China itself, by the self-development and improvement of the socialist system, and by the joint efforts of all ethnic groups. This further proves that the socialist system has a strong vitality.

The ancients said, "At the age of forty, one is free from confusion." After 40 years of trials and tribulations, the People's Republic of China, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has created and accumulated rich experience in building socialism. In recent years, the people of Shandong have summarized the great changes since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee as "relying on three things," and now, in addition to "relying on three things," they have extended it to "relying on four things": relying on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, relying on adhering to the four cardinal principles, relying on opposing bourgeois liberalization, and relying on doing well in four major tasks. As long as we consistently adhere to the basic line of "one center, two basic points," grasp both tasks firmly, and advance steadily according to the "three-step" strategy for economic development, the cause of socialism will shine even more brightly in Shandong.

    社会主义在山东大放光彩中共
    山东省委书记　姜春云
    在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱斗争中取得了决定性胜利的中国人民，正满怀着喜悦的心情，迈着矫健的步伐进入建国40周年。
    回眸走过的战斗历程，我们由衷地感到，这40年是中国人民扬眉吐气的40年，是祖国强盛、民族振兴的40年，归根结蒂是社会主义在神州大地节节胜利的40年。40年来，山东人民在中国共产党领导下，高举社会主义旗帜，重整河山，使齐鲁大地旧貌换新颜。
    人们不会忘记，几千年的封建社会、一百多年帝国主义列强的侵略和国民党反动派几十年的腐朽统治，留给中国人民的是屈辱、贫困和灾难。解放前的山东大地，更是千疮百孔，民不聊生。经过40年的整治建设，今日的山东，从城市到乡村，呈现了百业俱兴、政通人和、人民安居乐业的昌盛景象。
    40年间，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，山东整个经济实力大为增强。同1949年相比，全省社会总产值增长41倍，国民收入增长23倍，工农业总产值增长38倍。而近10年，又是山东生产力发展最快、各项社会事业突飞猛进、人民得到实惠最多的时期，6年间基本解决了世世代代没有解决的温饱问题，7年间实现了第一个经济翻番，人们改革开放、建设四化的积极性空前高涨，精神风貌为之一新。经济和社会事业这样长时期高效高速发展，为旧中国历代所没有，就是当代发达的资本主义国家也为之瞠目。
    40年间，山东的农业生产大幅度增长。1988年同1949年相比，粮食单产由53公斤增加到260多公斤，总产由870万吨增加到3225万吨，棉花由8万吨增加到113万吨，花生由54万吨增加到194万吨，肉类、水产、果品等也几倍、十几倍地增长。农民的生活正在向宽裕型、小康型迈进。
    40年间，山东已形成门类比较齐全、结构和布局日趋合理的工业体系。石油工业从无到有，建成了年产3300万吨原油的大油田；解放前“手无寸铁”，现在铁产量达到248万吨，钢191万吨；1988年原煤产量为1949年的32倍；年发电量增长138倍。一批大型化学、机械、电子和轻纺等新兴技术工业企业也在近几年建成投产。乡镇工业星罗棋布，产值已占整个工业总产值的1／3，相当于1949年全省工业总产值的61倍。全省已形成陆、海、空相衔接的四通八达的交通网，公路遍及全省城乡，客运量和货运量分别比40年前增长30倍和71倍。
    40年间，山东的对外贸易不断扩大，已与150多个国家和地区建立了经贸关系，出口总额比建国初期增长84倍，主要是改革开放以来取得的成就。整个对外经济贸易、技术合作与交流呈现出良好发展势头和广阔前景。
    40年间，山东的科技、文教、卫生、体育等事业蓬勃发展。建国初期全省科研机构和人员寥寥无几，现已形成门类比较齐全的科研体系。近10年取得重要科技成果一万多项，占建国以来总数的85％。旧中国，山东80％以上的人口是文盲，现在全省高等院校已发展到52所；学龄儿童入学率由20％提高到98.4％。在中国人被称为“东亚病夫”的时代，山东人口平均寿命只有35岁；现在，天花、黑热病、伤寒等恶性传染病已基本消灭，人均寿命达71岁，健康水平普遍提高。
    40年的发展，显示了社会主义在古老的齐鲁大地上大放光芒。没有共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义才能救中国、兴中国，这是人民的心声，历史的结论。那种“社会主义的尝试和失败是20世纪一大遗产”的说法，荒谬至极，不值一驳。在960万平方公里土地上建设有中国特色的社会主义，前无古人，不可避免会出现某些挫折和失误。而前进中的失误又都是靠中国共产党自身的力量，靠社会主义制度的自我发展和完善，靠各族人民的共同努力纠正的。这也更加证明，社会主义制度具有强大的生命力。
    古人曰：“四十而不惑”。中华人民共和国经过40年风风雨雨的磨练，在马列主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，创造和积累了建设社会主义的丰富经验。前几年，山东人民总结党的十一届三中全会以来的巨大变化，归结为“靠三”，如今在“靠三”的同时，引伸为“靠四”：靠党的十三届四中全会精神，靠坚持四项基本原则，靠反对资产阶级自由化，靠办好四件大事。只要我们始终如一地坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，坚持“两手抓”，坚定不移地按照经济发展的“三步曲”奋进，社会主义事业必将在山东放射出更加灿烂的光彩。
