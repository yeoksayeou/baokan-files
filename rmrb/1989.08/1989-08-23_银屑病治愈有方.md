More than 2,000 psoriasis patients have been cured and discharged from the Beijing Haidian District Yongfeng Psoriasis Specialty Hospital and the Shandong County Huagou Psoriasis Specialty Hospital. Both hospitals are led by the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Qi Zhen as the director.

Psoriasis, commonly known as "silver scale disease," currently has a cure rate of less than 50% with existing medications, and these treatments often have significant side effects. Qi Zhen, using a family-secret prescription, has developed an effective remedy. The treatment involves external application to address the symptoms and acupuncture to regulate the blood to treat the root cause. Using this "external application and bloodletting" method to treat psoriasis, the clinical cure rate exceeds 95%, and the recurrence rate within three years is less than 15%.

    银屑病治愈有方
    本报讯　2000余名银屑病患者，经北京海淀区永丰银屑病专科医院和山东桓台县华沟银屑病专科医院治愈出院。这两家医院都由中医师亓镇任院长。
    银屑病俗称“牛皮癣”，目前的药物治愈率不到50％，且毒副作用大。亓镇借助祖传秘方，研制出治癣良药，外敷治标，同时以刺穴调血治本。采用这种“外敷、刺血”法医治银屑病，临床治愈率超过95％，愈后3年以上局部复发率低于15％。　（徐之）
