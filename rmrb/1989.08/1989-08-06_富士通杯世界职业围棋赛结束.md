Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 5th.

Japanese top-tier Go player Takeyama Michiharu today defeated another top-tier player Nie Wei Ping in the final of the 2nd Fujitsu Cup World Professional Go Championship, relying on his formidable strength to successfully defend his title. Nie Wei Ping once again secured the runner-up position.

The final and the third-place match of the 2nd Fujitsu Cup World Professional Go Championship were held today in Tokyo. The finalists were the same as the previous year: Takeyama Michiharu against Nie Wei Ping. Playing black, Takeyama fully utilized the advantages of the "Cosmic Style," maintaining an advantage from the opening moves. Despite Nie Wei Ping's renowned tenacity, he was almost helpless today. After 209 moves, he conceded defeat.

The third-place match was between two South Korean players. Cho Hun-hyun, a 9-dan player, won against Seo Bong-soo in a middle-game victory, taking only three hours while playing black.

During the award ceremony of the 2nd Fujitsu Cup World Professional Go Championship, the organizing committee announced that the 3rd Fujitsu Cup World Professional Go Championship will be held from next April to August.

    富士通杯世界职业围棋赛结束
    新华社东京八月五日电　（记者姜占国）日本超一流棋手武宫正树今天在第二届富士通杯世界职业围棋赛决赛中，凭借雄厚的实力，再次击败另一名超一流棋手林海峰，蝉联冠军，林海峰再次获亚军。
    第二届富士通杯世界职业围棋赛决赛和争夺第三名的比赛今天在东京举行。参加决赛的棋手同上届一样，武宫正树对林海峰。执黑的武宫充分发挥了宇宙流的优势；从布局开始一直处于优势。林海峰尽管以顽强著称，但今天几乎一筹莫展弈至二百零九手时，他投子认输。
    争夺第三名的比赛在两名南朝鲜棋手之间进行。结果，曹薰铉九段仅用了三个小时执黑中盘胜徐奉洙。
    在第二届富士通杯世界职业围棋赛的发奖仪式上，主办单位人士宣布，第三届富士通杯世界职业围棋赛将于明年四月至八月举行。
