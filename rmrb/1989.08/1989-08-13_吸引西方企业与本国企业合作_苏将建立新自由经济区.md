This autumn, the Soviet city of Vyborg, which borders Finland, will establish a "free enterprise activity zone" to attract Western enterprises to cooperate with Soviet companies.

According to reports from local newspapers on August 12, the news about the establishment of the "free enterprise activity zone" was revealed by Soviet officials to members of the Finnish People's Democratic League parliamentary delegation visiting Vyborg on August 11.

Viktor Shlazov, the first secretary of the Vyborg City Committee, said that the political decision on this matter has been made, and it is expected that within the next two months, the Soviet government will discuss new legislation regarding the economic zone, granting Vyborg this special status.

It is reported that the primary goal of the Vyborg region is to produce goods with international competitiveness for the local market.

Vladimir Fedoseyev, a professor at the Leningrad State Planning Commission, said that joint ventures in the Vyborg region will enjoy complete tax exemption for the first three years, after which the tax rate will be 10%. Joint ventures will be guaranteed compensation for any losses incurred due to changes in enterprise legislation.

The free enterprise activity zone includes the entire city of Vyborg, covering an area of 7,500 square kilometers with a population of 210,000. The new joint ventures are expected to provide 50,000 to 60,000 jobs in this region. It is reported that in addition to Finland and West Germany, countries such as the United States, Britain, Japan, Sweden, and Norway have also expressed interest in cooperating with this free zone.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Moscow on August 10, the Soviet Union has decided to establish a new free economic zone in the Far Eastern city of Nakhodka.

This was revealed by Ivanov, the deputy chairman of the Soviet Foreign Economic Commission, in response to a question from a reporter from the weekly "Arguments and Facts." Ivanov said that Nakhodka focuses on deep processing of raw materials. Currently, plans are being accelerated to designate the tourist resorts of Novgorod and Sochi as tourist industrial zones.

    吸引西方企业与本国企业合作
    苏将建立新自由经济区
    新华社赫尔辛基8月12日电　今年秋天，与芬兰毗邻的苏联爱沙尼亚加盟共和国边境城市维堡地区将建立“自由企业活动区”，以便吸引西方的企业同苏联公司进行合作。
    据此间报纸12日报道，有关建立“自由企业活动区”的消息是苏联人士8月11日向访问维堡的芬兰人民民主联盟议会党团成员透露的。
    维堡市委第一书记维克托·什拉佐夫说，有关这一问题的政治决定已经作出，预计在今后2个月期间苏联政府讨论关于经济区的新的法案时，维堡将获得这一特殊地位。
    据介绍，维堡地区的首要目的是为当地市场生产具有国际竞争能力的商品。
    列宁格勒国家计委教授弗拉基米尔·费多谢杰夫说，维堡地区的合资企业建成后头3年享受完全免税待遇，之后征税率为10％。合资企业将获得担保，以便对由于企业立法可能发生的变化而造成的损失作出补偿。
    自由企业活动区包括整个维堡，其面积为7500平方公里，拥有21万人口。新的合资企业将为这一地区提供5万至6万个工作岗位。据悉，除了芬兰和西德，美国、英国、日本、瑞典和挪威等国也对这一自由区的合作表示有兴趣。
    据新华社莫斯科8月10日电　苏联决定在远东城市纳霍德卡建立新的自由经济区。
    这是苏联对外经济委员会副主席伊万诺夫日内在回答《论据与事实》周报记者问时透露的。伊万诺夫说，纳霍德卡以原材料深加工为主。目前正加紧制订将诺夫戈罗德和索契两个旅游胜地划为旅游工业区的方案。
