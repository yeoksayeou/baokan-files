Title: Children's Fly-Swatting: An Association

In the picture, this group of primary school students are holding fly swatters around a trash bin. What are they doing? Swatting flies.

What force drives these primary school students to disregard the filth and run around the streets where flies breed and gather? After the summer vacation began, some schools assigned fly-swatting tasks to their students.

Eliminating flies and mosquitoes and preventing epidemics, timely launching patriotic health campaigns, all of these are supported by the masses. However, some schools set fly-swatting quotas for students of different grades, forcing some children to swat flies around trash bins and piles of garbage in the scorching summer heat. This approach is not beneficial to the children's health.

In the summer heat, flies buzz, and mosquitoes bite. Who isn't annoyed? Who isn't irritated? I think local governments should take measures such as promptly removing garbage or spraying pesticides on trash bins to eliminate flies and mosquitoes. This approach would be more welcomed by the masses.

    儿童灭蝇的联想
    图中这群小学生手持蝇拍围着垃圾箱干什么？灭蝇。
    是一股什么力量驱使小学生们不顾肮脏奔走于街头蚊蝇孳生聚集处？暑假开始后，一些小学校给学生们布置了灭蝇任务。
    消灭蚊蝇、防止疫病，适时开展爱国卫生运动，群众拥护。但一些学校按不同年级给小学生规定灭蝇指标，使一些孩子不得不在大热天围着垃圾箱、垃圾堆拍打苍蝇，这种搞法，不利于孩子们的身体健康。
    夏日酷暑，苍蝇飞，蚊子咬，谁个不烦？哪个不恼？我看，各地政府应采取及时清运垃圾或对垃圾箱喷洒药物的办法来消灭蚊蝇，这样做会更受群众欢迎。
