The Soviet Union has expressed concern over Singapore's recent announcement that it plans to establish U.S. military facilities on its territory, which has sparked reactions in Southeast Asia. The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on August 14, saying that the development of the situation in Southeast Asia has drawn the attention of the Soviet Union.

The statement, read by the first deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Press Department, Gremitskykh, at a press briefing, noted that Singapore's plan has provoked strong reactions in many Southeast Asian countries.

The statement pointed out that this plan contradicts the ASEAN's idea of turning Southeast Asia into a zone of peace, freedom, and neutrality, and of ridding the region of nuclear weapons.

The statement said that the Soviet Union is concerned about the possible further expansion of U.S. military facilities in the region. It believes that the deployment of new U.S. military facilities in Southeast Asia will change the military and political situation in the region and worsen the political climate.

The statement concluded by saying that it is well known that the Soviet Union has proposed the idea of withdrawing military facilities from foreign territories by the year 2000 and firmly opposes the establishment of new military bases on foreign territories.

According to reports from Bangkok today, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan warned his cabinet members yesterday not to comment on the issue of Singapore providing military base facilities to the United States.

Yesterday, the Thai government held a cabinet meeting. Cabinet members generally agreed that, for the unity of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, all ministers should be told not to comment on this issue.

It is reported that within ASEAN, Thailand and Brunei believe that Singapore providing military bases to the United States is a matter for the two countries, but Indonesia and Malaysia have publicly expressed their opposition.

However, a Thai government spokesman said yesterday that even if Manila decides to close the U.S. Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines, the Thai government will not allow the United States to establish military facilities on its territory.

    苏关注新拟设美军事设施  泰对新加坡举措不予置评
    新华社莫斯科8月14日电（记者竺承军）苏联外交部发言人14日发表声明说，由于新加坡不久前表明，将在其领土上准备布置美国军事设施引起东南亚事态的发展，苏联对此表示关注。
    由外交部新闻局第一副局长格列米茨基赫在吹风会上宣读的这项声明指出，新加坡的这一计划在许多东南亚国家中引起了强烈的反应。
    东南亚国家认为，这一计划与东盟关于把东南亚变成和平、自由和中立区以及使该地区摆脱核武器的思想相违背。
    声明说，对美国可能在这一地区进一步扩大军事机构，苏联不能不表示担忧。声明认为，在东南亚部署美国新军事设施将导致该地区军事政治形势发生变化，而使政治气候恶化。
    声明最后说，众所周知，苏联曾提出在2000年前撤销在外国领土上的军事机构的想法，并坚决反对在外国领土上建立新的军事基地。
    新华社曼谷8月16日电  据此间报纸今天报道，泰国总理差猜·春哈旺昨天告诫其内阁成员，对于新加坡向美国提供军事基地设施问题，不要发表意见和看法。
    昨天，泰国政府举行内阁会议。
    阁员们普遍认为，为了东南亚国家联盟的团结，应告诉所有部长，不要对此发表评论。
    据报道，在东盟内，泰国和文莱认为新加坡向美国提供军事基地属于它们两国的事情，但印度尼西亚和马来西亚则对此公开表示反对。
    然而，泰国政府发言人昨天说，即使马尼拉决定关闭美国在菲律宾的克拉克空军基地和苏比克海军基地，泰国政府也不会允许美国在其领土上建立军事设施。
