French mountaineering team to ascend Mount Everest

Agence France-Presse reported on the 9th that this team of 22 members, with the ambition to achieve what no French person has yet accomplished, left Paris. They plan to ascend the summit, which is 8,848 meters high, from the northeastern ridge of Mount Everest on the Chinese Tibetan side.

Many members of this team have already climbed several peaks over 8,000 meters. The French have high hopes for the five female team members, hoping that a French woman will successfully conquer the world's highest peak.

    法登山队将攀登喜马拉雅山
    新华社巴黎8月9日电　（记者茅瑞清）法国登山队将在今后几星期内攀登喜马拉雅山。
    据法新社9日报道，这支由22名队员组成的登山队怀着要实现法国人至今还未实现的雄心壮志离开巴黎。他们计划从中国西藏一侧沿喜马拉雅山的东北山脊登上海拔8848米高的峰顶。
    这支登山队中许多人已登上过好几座8000米以上的山峰。法国人对该队中的5名女队员更寄予厚望，希望有一名法国妇女能成功地征服世界第一高峰。
