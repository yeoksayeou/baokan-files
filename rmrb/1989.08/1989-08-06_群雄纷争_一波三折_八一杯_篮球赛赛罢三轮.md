The third round of the "August First Cup" basketball tournament concluded yesterday, with the Guangzhou Military Region team defeating the powerful August First team 81:80. Currently, the Nanjing Military Region team and the August First team, who were the champions and runners-up of the previous "August First Cup," both have records of two wins and two losses, losing their chances to enter the top two this year.

The Jinan Military Region team, the Air Force team, the Shenyang Military Region team, the Beijing Military Region team, and the Guangzhou Military Region team all have records of two wins and one loss, with equal points. The national second-tier Air Force team has been particularly impressive, playing aggressively and actively in the first two rounds, defeating both the August First and Nanjing Military Region teams. The participating teams this time are closely matched in strength, making the competition extremely intense. The games often see dramatic twists and turns, with the outcome uncertain until the final second. This has created a chaotic situation where multiple teams are vying for the top spot, a scenario rarely seen in past military basketball tournaments. It is still uncertain which team will be crowned the winner of this "August First Cup." Additionally, in the three days since the tournament began, no team has remained undefeated, indicating the fierce competition. The era of a single dominant team in military men's basketball has ended, and it is also evident that military basketball has not seen significant development in recent years, making it difficult to produce representative teams with outstanding technical and tactical skills. This is a problem that the military basketball community should pay attention to.

    群雄纷争  一波三折
   “八一杯”篮球赛赛罢三轮
    本报乌鲁木齐8月6日电　“八一杯”篮球赛第三轮交战烽烟昨日已熄，广州部队队以81∶80把实力雄厚的八一队打落下马。目前，上届“八一杯”冠亚军南京部队与八一队成绩均是三战两负，失去进本届前两名的机会。
    济南部队、空军、沈阳部队、北京部队、广州部队队五支队伍成绩均是三战两胜，积分相等。全国乙级队空军队比赛中大出风头，在前两轮的比赛中，打得积极主动，敢于拚抢，先后战胜了八一、南京部队队。这次参赛的各路劲旅实力接近，比赛争夺异常激烈，赛中常常是一波三折，不打完最后一秒，胜负难卜，出现了群雄纷争天下的混战局面，这种错综复杂的情况，是以往全军篮球赛中罕见的。这届“八一杯”得主头衔授谁，尚难预料。同时，开赛三天来，没有一个队全胜，这说明竞赛激烈，某一个强队称霸军队男篮篮坛的时代已结束，同时说明近几年军队篮球运动发展不快，较难产生技战术水平冒尖的代表队，这是全军篮球界值得注意的问题。
