The Hong Kong Nan Tian Book Company published a collection of Zhou Zuoren's letters in January 1971, titled *Zhītáng Shūxín Jí*. This book is quite interesting. The letters collected in it, especially those from Zhou Zuoren's later years, often contain thoughts he did not express publicly—especially those he was not comfortable expressing publicly after the liberation. These letters can be compared with his previously published works, helping us better understand his views.

For example, in June 1945, Zhou Zuoren wrote an essay titled *Talking About Writing* (included in *Zhītáng Yǐyǒu Wénbiān*), in which he stated: "The most common mistake in writing is affectation, and when this happens, the writing is ruined. I have seen some writings that are not bad; they have meaning to convey and sufficient words and phrases to use, and they could have been written well. However, there is a difficult point here. Writing is done by an individual, but the audience is the general public, so it is similar to giving a speech, and giving a speech is not much different from acting. The speaker wants to persuade the audience, but it is easy to be controlled by the audience. If a phrase or action is appreciated by the audience, it is often unconsciously repeated, such as pounding the table and saying everyone should charge forward, receiving applause and cheers, then roaring that everyone must charge forward and cannot not charge forward, pounding the table so that the glass cups jump. In this way, the speech that guides the audience and the performance that entertains the audience are almost the same.... I read ancient and modern writings and often find flaws. This is to say, like a speaker, it seems as if he is straining his voice to shout, pounding the table, glaring and baring his teeth, all kinds of strange expressions come out from the paper.... Here I only speak abstractly, but I have seen many real examples, shocking to the eyes, deeply feeling that writing is not easy, and if one is not careful, one will reveal ugly appearances. Even if there is no base intention, it still looks very bad. We can try it ourselves. For example, if a few friends are chatting, when they chat enthusiastically, everyone easily speaks enthusiastically, and even if they do not make mistakes, they often emphasize their words, exceeding the original meaning. This experience is common to everyone, and if it is applied to writing, it makes the author's original intention confused. If there is also an intention to avoid, it becomes an ugly appearance, although the trace is very subtle, but to those who are slightly familiar with antiques, it is obviously known. Often, there are writings that are highly praised by the world, but I feel bad when I read them, such as the ancient Han Yu."

This passage is obviously not a general statement; it must have a specific target. The target is not the ancient Han Yu, but someone in the modern era. This is why he says he has seen real examples, shocking to the eyes.

So, who is the target?

I believe that Zhou Zuoren's remarks mainly target Lu Xun. This is deduced from his relationship with Lu Xun, his relationship with left-wing writers, and his literary thoughts and propositions. I am confident in my deduction, but deduction is not evidence. It was not until I saw *Zhītáng Shūxín Jí* that the evidence was found. In a letter dated January 20, 1958, to Cao Juren, he wrote: "There is no saint in the world, so people inevitably have flaws. Lu Xun's writing attitude is serious and tense, sometimes dramatic, and what he says is inevitably fictional, which is unreal." In another letter dated May 20, 1958, to Cao Juren, he said that Lu Xun "has a dramatic side" and that "Lu Xun's usual words and actions are also affected (everyone has this, and it is not surprising)." Here, the terms "dramatic," "fictional," and "affected" used in the attacks are the same as those in the essay *Talking About Writing*, such as "affectation" and "acting." By comparing these, it is clear that the latter mainly targets Lu Xun.

### 周作人攻击“文章作态”之所指

    周作人攻击“文章作态”之所指
    舒羌
    香港南天书业公司1971年元月出版《知堂书信集》一种，是很有意思的书。书中所收周作人晚年的书信，往往有他不肯公开说出——特别是他在解放以后不便公开说出的话，很可以与他曾经公开发表的文字参看，帮助我们的理解。
    例如，周作人1945年6月写过一篇《谈文章》（收入《知堂乙酉文编》中），中有云：“做文章最容易犯的毛病其一便是作态，犯时文章就坏了。我看有些文章本来并不坏的，他有意思要说，有词句足用，原可以好好的写出来，不过这里却有一个难关。文章是个人所写，对手却是多数人，所以这与演说相近，而演说更与做戏相差不远。演说者有话想说服大众，然而也容易反为大众所支配，有一句话或一举动被听众所赏识，常不免无意识的重演，如拍桌说大家应当冲锋，得到鼓掌与喝彩，下面便怒吼说大家不可不冲锋不能不冲锋，拍桌使玻璃杯都蹦跳了。这样，引导听众的演说与娱乐观众的做戏实在已没有多大区别。……我读古今文章，往往看出破绽，这便是说同演说家一样，仿佛听他榨扁了嗓子在吼叫了，在拍桌了，在努目厉齿了，种种怪相都从纸上露出来，……这里只抽象的说，我却见过好些实例，触目惊心，深觉得文章不好写，一不小心便会现出丑态来，即使别无卑鄙的用意，也说（原书排印如此。——引者注）很不好看。我们自己可以试验了看，如有几个朋友谈天，谈到兴高采烈的时候各人都容易乘兴而言，即不失言也常常要口气加重致超过原意之上，此种经验人人可有，移在文章上便使作者本意迷胡，若再有趋避的意识那就成为丑态，虽然迹甚隐微，但在略识古董的伙计看去则固显然可知也。往往有举世推尊的文章我看了胸中作恶，如古代的韩退之即其一也。”这一番话显然不是泛泛之谈，一定大有所指，所指并非古之韩愈，而是现代的什么人，这才说得上什么“见过实例，触目惊心”云云。
    那么，这究竟指的是谁呢？
    我认为周作人这段话主要是攻击鲁迅，这是从他与鲁迅的关系，从他与左翼作家的关系，从他的文学思想文学主张来推断的。我自信推断得有理，可是推断究竟不等于证据。直到看到《知堂书信集》，证据才算找到了。其1958年1月20日致曹聚仁函云：“世无圣人，所以人总难免有缺点。鲁迅写文态度本是严肃、紧张有时戏剧性的，所说不免有小说化之处，即是失实”。又同年5月20日致曹聚仁函中，说鲁迅“本有戏剧性的一面”，“鲁迅平常言动亦有做作（人人都有，原也难怪）。”这里所谓“戏剧性”，所谓“小说化”，所谓
  “做作”，这些攻击之词，同那篇《谈文章》里说的所谓“作态”，所谓“做戏”，如出一口。这么一对照，后者主要是指鲁迅，便十分清楚了。
