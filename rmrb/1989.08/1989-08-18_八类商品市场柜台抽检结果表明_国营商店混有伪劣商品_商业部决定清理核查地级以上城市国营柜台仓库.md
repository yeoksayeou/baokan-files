Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 18th.

An official from the Ministry of Commerce's Science and Technology Quality Bureau today briefed the capital's media on the inspection results of eight categories of goods from state-run commercial enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other parts of the country. The inspection covered 132 state-run commercial enterprises selling bicycles, synthetic detergent, wool textiles, fertilizers, pesticides, dyes, aluminum pressure cookers, and rubber-soled shoes. The data indicates that despite recent efforts to improve product quality and commercial management, the quality of goods in state-run stores and supply and marketing cooperatives remains a significant issue.

Bicycles: 13 models were inspected, with 91.04% meeting or basically meeting the standards, and 8.96% not meeting the standards.

Synthetic Detergent: 23 samples were inspected, with only 17.37% meeting the standards, 26.1% not meeting the standards, and 56.53% being counterfeit or substandard.

Wool Textiles: 80 samples were inspected, with 70% meeting the fiber content standards and 30% not meeting the standards.

Home Voltage Stabilizers and Refrigerator Protectors: 47 models were inspected, with 44.68% not meeting the standards and 55.32% being substandard.

Fertilizers and Pesticides: 22 samples were inspected, with 75.56% meeting or basically meeting the standards and 24.44% not meeting the standards.

Dyes: 32 samples were inspected, with 78.12% meeting the standards and 21.88% not meeting the standards.

Aluminum Pressure Cookers: 5 models were inspected, with 80% meeting the standards and 20% not meeting the standards.

Rubber-Soled Shoes: The physical and mechanical performance of the inspected samples reached the first-grade rate of only 47.6%, and the appearance quality reached the first-grade rate of only 37%.

In response to the inspection results of these eight categories of goods, the Ministry of Commerce has decided to conduct a thorough inspection and clearance of the counters and warehouses of state-run stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in cities at the prefecture level and above before the National Day. This is to ensure that counterfeit and substandard goods are strictly prevented from entering the market.
