On August 23, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and South African Acting President F.W. de Klerk held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting in Livingstone, Zambia, discussing the future of South Africa, the peace process in Angola, and the independence process of Namibia.

In recent times, relevant parties have frequently consulted on the issue of Southern Africa, actively seeking a peaceful resolution to the region's problems. On August 21 and 22, the Summit of the OAU Special Committee on Southern Africa and the Summit of the Heads of State of Eight African Countries on Achieving Peace in Angola were held in Harare. On August 25, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko held a bilateral meeting with De Klerk in Zaire to promote peace in Angola. On August 27, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rushed to South Africa to discuss issues in the reconciliation process between UNITA and the government with De Klerk. The high-level meeting in Livingstone was part of these efforts.

During his meeting with De Klerk, Kaunda exchanged views on South Africa's domestic "reforms" and negotiations between the South African government and the African National Congress (ANC). Since the beginning of this year, De Klerk, who succeeded to the chairmanship of the ruling National Party, has repeatedly claimed to strengthen "reforms" within South Africa. At the same time, the South African government has occasionally hinted that it is willing to negotiate with the ANC to resolve the issue of apartheid, and has continuously sent envoys to contact the ANC to understand the organization's stance and policies on resolving South Africa's racial issues. These actions by the South African authorities have attracted the attention of the international community, especially the frontline states. On the other hand, while the ANC has insisted on armed struggle, it has also adjusted its strategy on eliminating the apartheid system. In July, the imprisoned leader of the organization, Nelson Mandela, met with the then South African President P.W. Botha and stated, "Dialogue is the only way to end conflict and achieve peace in South Africa." On August 10, the Summit of the Frontline States, based on documents provided by the ANC, adopted a declaration on negotiating a resolution to the South African issue. This declaration was recognized by the Summit of the OAU Special Committee on Southern Africa on August 21. It will be submitted as an official OAU document to the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth. Before the meeting with De Klerk, foreign media reported that South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha had stated that if Kaunda handed over the declaration on the South African issue adopted by the OAU Special Committee to De Klerk, the South African side would be willing to discuss the contents of the document with Kaunda. After this meeting, De Klerk said that he had had an in-depth discussion with Kaunda on the future of South Africa and was willing to begin the negotiation process. However, he emphasized that the apartheid system is an internal matter of South Africa. This indicates that, with the promotion of the international community, although the relevant parties have taken a gratifying step in resolving the South African issue through dialogue, the true resolution of the problem will still be a long-term process.

If the South African authorities are sincere about resolving the issue of apartheid through negotiations, they should take concrete steps, first accepting the negotiation conditions proposed by the ANC: releasing all political prisoners, including Mandela, ending the state of emergency, and lifting the ban on the ANC and other anti-apartheid organizations. The international community is now watching what concrete actions the South African authorities will take after the early September elections.

    南部非洲形势缓和的又一幕
    史非  景卫
    8月23日，赞比亚总统卡翁达和南非代总统德克勒克在赞比亚旅游城利文斯敦举行了两个半小时会谈，讨论了南非的未来前途、安哥拉国内和平进程和纳米比亚独立进程等问题。
    最近一个时期以来，有关各方就南部非洲问题频繁磋商，积极努力寻求该地区问题的和平解决。8月21日和22日在哈拉雷分别举行了非统南部非洲问题特别委员会首脑会议和关于实现安哥拉国内和平的非洲8国首脑会议。25日扎伊尔总统蒙博托同德克勒克在扎伊尔举行了一次关于促进安哥拉国内和平的双边会谈。27日，安盟领导人萨文比赶赴南非同德克勒克磋商了安盟同政府实现和解过程中的问题，利文斯敦高级会晤正是这些努力的一部分。
    卡翁达在同德克勒克会晤中就南非国内“改革”和南非政府同南非非洲人国民大会和谈等问题交换了意见。德克勒克今年初继任南非执政的国民党主席职务以来，不断声称要加强南非国内的“改革”。与此同时，南非政府不时放风说，愿同南非非洲人国民大会和谈解决种族隔离问题，并不断派人与南非非洲人国民大会接触，了解该组织对解决南非种族主义问题的立场和政策。南非当局的这些言行引起了国际社会，特别是前线国家的关注。另一方面，南非非洲人国民大会在坚持武装斗争的同时，也在调整消除种族隔离制度问题的策略。7月，被监禁的该组织领导人曼德拉会见了南非当时的总统博塔，并发表声明说，“对话是结束冲突、实现南非和平的唯一道路”。8月10日，前线国家首脑会议根据南非非洲人国民大会提供的文件通过了一项关于和谈解决南非问题的宣言。该宣言于8月21日被非统南部非洲问题特别委员会首脑会议认可。它将作为非统正式文件提交联合国、不结盟运动和英联邦等国际组织备案。卡翁达同德克勒克会谈前，外电报道说，南非外长皮克·博塔曾表示，如果卡翁达将非统特委会会议通过的关于南非问题的宣言转交给德克勒克，南非方面乐意同卡翁达讨论文件内容。此次会谈后德克勒克说，他同卡翁达就南非前途问题作了深入讨论，表示愿意开始和谈进程。但又强调，种族隔离制度是南非的内政问题。这表明，在国际社会的促进下，尽管有关各方在通过对话解决南非问题上迈出了可喜的一步，但问题的真正解决仍将是一个长期的过程。
    南非当局如真有诚意通过和谈解决种族隔离制度问题，那么它就应当采取实际步骤，首先接受南非非洲人国民大会提出的和谈条件：释放包括曼德拉在内的一切政治犯，结束紧急状态法，解除对南非非洲人国民大会和其他反种族隔离组织的禁令。现在国际社会正在注视着9月初大选后的南非当局在这方面采取什么切实行动。　　　（本报哈拉雷8月29日电）
