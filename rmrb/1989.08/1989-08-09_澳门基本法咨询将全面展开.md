The consultation work on the Basic Law of Macao, conducted by the Macao Basic Law Consultative Committee, has been progressing smoothly and is about to be fully launched.

The Macao Basic Law Consultative Committee, composed of various sectors of Macao, began its preparations in November last year and was officially established in May this year. The committee held its first plenary meeting in mid-July, and everything is proceeding according to the original plan. Recently, to support the drafting of the Basic Law (draft) structure, the committee has established a special consultation subcommittee on the Basic Law structure to conduct consultation activities on this specific topic. In the future, as the drafting of the Basic Law progresses, corresponding special consultation subcommittees will be established.

Since the beginning of this year, some social organizations in Macao have successively established Basic Law attention groups, whose purpose is to promote and encourage citizens to contribute ideas and suggestions for the drafting of the Basic Law, and to collect and reflect the opinions and suggestions of the citizens.

At present, the special consultation subcommittee on the Basic Law structure has established contact with the attention groups of eleven social organizations and has held discussions on future consultation work. According to the secretariat of the consultative committee, in addition to maintaining close contact with various attention groups and collecting opinions through consultations, the special consultation subcommittee will also conduct multi-channel and multi-level consultation activities through public forums, public hearings, and questionnaires.

    澳门基本法咨询将全面展开
    新华社澳门8月9日电　（记者罗照明）澳门基本法咨委会成立以来，工作进展顺利，基本法咨询工作即将全面展开。
    由澳门各界人士组成的澳门基本法咨询委员会，于去年11月开始筹组，今年5月成立，7月中旬举行第一次全体会议，一切均按原定计划进行。最近，为了配合基本法结构（草案）的起草工作，咨委会成立了基本法结构专责咨询小组，就基本法结构这个专题进行咨询活动。今后，随着基本法起草工作的进展，还将设立相应的专责咨询小组。
    今年以来，澳门一些社团组织先后成立了基本法关注小组，其宗旨是推动和鼓励市民为起草基本法出谋献策，搜集和反映市民的意见和建议。
    目前，基本法结构专责咨询小组已同十一个社团的关注小组建立联系，并就今后的咨询工作进行过座谈。据咨委会秘书处介绍，专责咨询小组除了同各个关注小组保持密切联系、咨询收集意见外，还将通过公开论坛、公听会、问卷调查等多种形式，开展多渠道多层次的咨询活动。
