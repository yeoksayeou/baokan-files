Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 12th.

Some Indian parliamentarians have condemned the so-called "International Conference on Tibet and Peace in South Asia," which supports the Dalai Lama in creating splits and interfering in China's internal affairs.

Anand Sharma, a parliamentarian from the ruling Congress Party (I), said that holding such a conference in India would nullify the progress made in improving relations with China.

Sugumar Sen, a parliamentarian from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said the government should take measures to ensure that the Dalai Lama does not engage in activities that harm the improvement of relations between India and China.

Chidambaram Subramaniam, a parliamentarian from the All India Forward Bloc, said India should not allow activities against China to be carried out on its soil.

The conference was chaired by former Indian President Zail Singh.

The three-day conference was attended by politicians, religious leaders, and journalists from India and other countries.
