Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 24th.

Taiwanese businesses remain optimistic about the mainland market despite the impact of the June 4th incident. According to a report by Taiwan's "Economic Daily News," the "Chinese Economic Research Institute" recently analyzed that as of mid-July, half of Taiwan's manufacturers still hold hope for the mainland market. They predict that this year's cross-strait trade volume will exceed $30 billion. Additionally, due to factors such as the search for cheap labor and linguistic commonality, the future development of cross-strait economic and trade relations remains promising.

According to a survey by Taiwan's "Council for Economic Planning and Development," after the June 4th incident, 49% of manufacturers stated they would not invest in the mainland. However, by July 5th, 51% of manufacturers expressed an optimistic attitude, indicating that Taiwanese manufacturers still have a strong interest in the mainland market.

The deputy director of the Mainland Research Institute of the Chinese Economic Research Institute, Ye Xinxing, pointed out that cross-strait trade has surged from $47.68 million in 1978 to $2.72 billion in 1988, representing a 69-fold increase. The average annual growth rate is 67.5%, and over eleven years, Taiwan's trade surplus with the mainland has accumulated to $5.15 billion.

    台商看好大陆市场
    今年两岸贸易将超三十亿美元
    据新华社北京八月二十四日电　据台湾《工商时报》报道，台湾“中华经济研究院”日前分析指出，尽管“六·四事件”引起台商相当的震动，但截至七月中旬，仍有半数的台湾厂商对大陆市场存有希望。他们预计，今年海峡两岸转口贸易额将会超过三十亿美元，而且，由于台湾厂商寻找廉价劳力及语言相通等因素，未来两岸经贸发展仍然乐观。
    据台湾“经建会”的一份调查资料指出，“六·四事件”发生后，有百分之四十九的厂商表示不会再去大陆投资，但到七月五日，则有百分之五十一的厂商表示乐观态度，显示台湾厂商对大陆市场仍深具兴趣。
    台湾“中华经济研究院”大陆研究所副所长叶新兴表示，海峡两岸转口贸易自一九七八年的四千七百六十八万美元，激增到一九八八年的二十七点二亿美元，增长了六十九倍，年平均增长率高达百分之六十七点五，十一年来，台湾对大陆的贸易顺差累积已达五十一点五亿美元。
