    The Tangshan Iron and Steel Company's First Steel Plant recently achieved a milestone by ensuring that 124,000 furnaces of steel were checked and shipped without any mixing errors, setting a new national record.

    To address the issue of mixing different types and furnace numbers of ingots and billets during production, the plant created modern management process flowcharts and accident cause-and-effect analysis diagrams. They developed 8 technical safeguard measures and implemented a three-level inspection and supervision system consisting of "self-inspection, mutual inspection, and specialized inspection." Additionally, they optimized standard operating procedures, ensuring that all 124,000 furnaces of steel were shipped without any mixing errors.
