From last August to this June, Saitama Prefecture in Japan has seen four consecutive cases of child abductions. Despite the police's all-out efforts, no leads were found. Since August 10, the situation has taken a dramatic turn. A 26-year-old man named Miyazaki Tsutomu has confessed to committing three of the four cases. Two 4-year-old girls and one 5-year-old girl were all killed and dismembered by him.

Miyazaki lives with his parents and has a room of over 10 square meters to himself, which he does not allow his parents to enter. Inside his room, there are over 4,000 videotapes, most of which contain horrifying content. Titles include "Bloody Flower," "Demon Nurse," and "Introduction to Murder," among others. Miyazaki admitted that his methods of killing the children were modeled after the content of these videotapes. The police investigation revealed that his killing methods were similar to those depicted in the second episode of "Bloody Flower."

According to people who have interacted with Miyazaki, he is introverted and unsociable. Miyazaki's personality has made him an outcast among his peers, leading him to vent his frustrations on the weak and fill his spiritual void with terrifying videotapes. Public opinion holds that the societal background of unrestrainedly publishing such terrifying and trivial videotapes bears an inescapable responsibility for the formation of criminal psychology.

    杀人狂与录相带
    从去年8月到今年6月，日本埼玉县接连发生4起拐骗儿童案件。警方全力搜查未得线索。8月10日以来，形势急转直下。一名26岁名叫宫崎勤的青年，先后供认，4起案件中的3起是他干的。两名4岁一名5岁的女孩都被他杀害并碎尸。
    宫崎与父母同住一处，自己有间10多平方米的房间，平日不让父母进入自己房间。屋内录相带竟达4000多盘，恐怖内容居多。如《血肉之花》、《恶魔女医》，还有《杀人学入门》等。宫崎供认杀害儿童的方法是模仿录相带。警方调查表明，其杀害手法与《血肉之花》第二集相似。
    据接触过宫崎的人说，宫崎性格孤僻内向，不善交往。宫崎的性格使他在同辈人中成为被遗忘的角落，导致他向弱者发泄自己的苦闷，用恐怖内容的录相带充填精神的空虚。舆论认为，肆无忌惮地出版那些恐怖和无聊内容录相带的社会背景对犯罪心理的形成，负有不可推卸的责任。
