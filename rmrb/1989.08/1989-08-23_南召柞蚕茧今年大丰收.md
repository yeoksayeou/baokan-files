South Chuan's Oak Silkworm Cocoons See a Bumper Harvest This Year

	The People's Daily reports: This year, South Chuan County in Henan Province has overcome natural disasters such as wind, pests, and low temperatures, achieving a bumper harvest of oak silkworm cocoons. The total production reached 73,000 piculs, an increase of 16.6% compared to last year. The cocoons are generally large, have good color, and thick silk layers, with the weight of 10,000 cocoons increasing from 65 kilograms to 75 kilograms.

	South Chuan County has a history of over 2,000 years of silkworm rearing, with its production accounting for more than 50% of the entire province of Henan. To increase the rearing volume, last winter, farmers in the entire county scientifically pruned 500,000 mu of oak slopes. The county's sericulture department brought in 50,000 kilograms of high-quality cocoon seeds from other places and organized technical personnel to visit various townships to disseminate technology. They trained over 4,200 silkworm rearing cadres, improving the farmers' scientific silkworm rearing skills.

    本报讯　河南省南召县今年战胜风、虫、低温等自然灾害，夺得柞蚕茧大丰收，总产达到七点三万担，比去年增加百分之十六点六。蚕茧普遍个头大、色泽好、丝层厚，万粒茧重量由过去的六十五公斤增加到七十五公斤。
    南召县养蚕已有二千多年的历史，其产量占河南全省的百分之五十以上。为了提高放养量，去冬全县农民科学修剪柞坡五十万亩，县蚕业部门从外地调回五万公斤优良茧种，还组织技术人员到各乡镇巡回传播技术，先后培训养蚕骨干四千二百多名，提高了农民科学养蚕水平。　（徐自明）
