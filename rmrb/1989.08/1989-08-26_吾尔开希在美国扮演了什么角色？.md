Wu'er Kaixi, who admitted to defecting abroad with the assistance of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, became an instant "celebrity" in the U.S. after arriving from Paris in late July. He was either invited to lavish banquets or elevated to speak at various venues. One moment he was rushing from Chicago to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., the next he was flying from the East Coast to the West Coast. A few politicians in the U.S. Congress, various pro-Taiwan organizations in the U.S., and American and Taiwanese media outlets hailed him as a "democracy fighter" and "national hero."

Wu'er Kaixi was delighted by all this attention, becoming even more arrogant and self-important. To repay his benefactors, he decided to put on a big show in this "free world," characterized by spreading rumors, insulting others, and shouting empty slogans. Perhaps he thought that the more he cursed, the more famous he would become. However, intentions do not always align with outcomes. His series of vulgar performances only made more and more students, overseas Chinese, and American public see through this political upstart, realizing he was neither a "fighter" nor a "hero." Some who once "worshipped" him gradually became disillusioned. Many upright Americans, patriotic overseas Chinese, and even Taiwanese students and scholars privately said, "Wu'er Kaixi is just a small-time clown seeking attention."

A Toy in Politicians' Hands

From the moment Wu'er Kaixi set foot on U.S. soil, he was at the mercy of others. The U.S. government assigned security personnel to act as his "bodyguards," shadowing him 24 hours a day.

A few reactionary forces in the U.S., members of the Taiwan North American Coordination Committee, members of the Taiwan-controlled various overseas Chinese organizations, and members of the reactionary organization "Chinese Democratic Union," along with reporters from the United Daily News North America News Center and members of the Taiwan-controlled various overseas Chinese organizations, all played a role in orchestrating Wu'er Kaixi's activities. Upon his arrival in the U.S., they deliberately kept him out of the public eye for the first two days to create an air of mystery. Then they arranged for him to be interviewed on U.S. television, followed by an article in the Taiwan-controlled New York-based World Journal encouraging him to engage in public activities. They then organized one "welcome reception," "speech," and "press conference" after another, doing everything possible to infiltrate the White House and Congress to lobby high-ranking U.S. officials to "meet" with him, urging them to support Wu'er Kaixi and a few other defectors in their activities against the Chinese government, aiming to sow discord and disrupt Sino-U.S. relations.

A few politicians in the U.S. Congress saw Wu'er Kaixi's arrival as a golden opportunity, believing they could use him for their own gain. Some rushed to meet with him, some awarded him "medals," some hosted dinners and yacht rides... A senior U.S. journalist who wished to remain anonymous saw this and pointed out bluntly, "This Chinese youth, Wu'er Kaixi, is just a toy in the hands of these congressmen." He said, "These congressmen, they have always been out to gain votes, disregarding international relations norms and their own dignity and status, embracing and kissing any 'celebrity' as long as it ensures they remain on the path to fame and fortune."

Meeting with KMT Leaders Was No Accident

On the evening of July 25, Wu'er Kaixi arrived in Chicago from Paris to attend the so-called "All-American Chinese Students and Scholars Representative Conference." However, as soon as he stepped off the plane, he ignored the mainland students who had come to "welcome" him at the airport, getting into a car and heading straight to the home of a certain "doctor" to meet with the director of the KMT Overseas Affairs Council, Zheng Xinxiong. This "doctor" was Wu Yingyi, the president of the Chicago Taiwan Compatriots Association, who was also the initiator and organizer of the so-called "American Support for Chinese Democracy Committee."

The news of Wu'er Kaixi's meeting with Zheng Xinxiong quickly spread among mainland student groups and the broader community of Chinese students, sparking strong reactions. Seeing the situation was not in their favor, KMT agents quickly had Wu Yingyi come up with a plan to help Wu'er Kaixi get out of the predicament, suggesting, "It would be best for Wu'er Kaixi to explain himself to clear up any unnecessary misunderstandings." Wu'er Kaixi was also flustered, fearing that this secret meeting would be exposed and damage his "hero" image. He hastily made phone calls late at night to the leaders of Chinese student groups in various parts of the U.S., explaining that he had been "unaware" of the situation beforehand.

However, no excuses could cover up the fact of the "meeting." It is well known that Zheng Xinxiong arrived in the U.S. from Taiwan just before the Chinese students' conference in Chicago, as revealed by the New York-based China Times Weekly, with the purpose of doing work among mainland students and "supporting" their so-called "democracy movement."

Ignorant and Arrogant

In the midst of all the praise, Wu'er Kaixi became a "political star," always presenting himself as a student "leader," often joking in public that he was the "best backdrop" of 1989. The New York-based Chinese-language newspaper World Journal reported that Wu'er Kaixi "confidently said his theoretical level was high, his experience in the democracy movement was sufficient, and his organizational abilities were strong, making him capable of taking on leadership responsibilities."

Regardless of the fact that many Chinese students, especially those from Beijing Normal University, knew Wu'er Kaixi's background, even foreigners and overseas Chinese began to feel disgusted by his arrogant demeanor. The Los Angeles-based Chinese-language newspaper International Daily said in an editorial, "A Taiwanese student expressed disdain for Wu'er Kaixi's overinflated self-image, always speaking on behalf of mainland students, finding it extremely offensive."

Even more laughable was his unreasonable attack on former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Kissinger recently wrote in U.S. publications, from the perspective of international strategic dynamics and America's long-term interests, merely advising the U.S. government not to impose further sanctions on China. In discussing the Tiananmen Incident, he said, "No government in the world would tolerate a situation where tens of thousands of protesters occupy its capital's main square for eight weeks." Wu'er Kaixi knew these words were detrimental to the rumors he had been spreading in Congress and other venues, so he launched a tirade against Dr. Kissinger, calling him "shameless," "spouting nonsense," and "uttering rubbish." A visiting scholar at Columbia University said, "I never expected Wu'er Kaixi's level to be so low. Apart from shouting slogans and cursing, he has nothing substantial to offer."

The World Journal was quite worried about his low level and showed a bit of dissatisfaction, using a critical tone to say, "To effectively lobby in the U.S., one cannot rely on sharp language and slogans, but needs to carefully craft words that align with Western values, are specific, and honest." Recently, Wu'er Kaixi expressed his intention to visit Taiwan, perhaps to receive some training there to reach the level expected by the World Journal.

    吾尔开希在美国扮演了什么角色？
    魏谷
    自己招认在美国中央情报局协助下叛逃到国外的“高自联”头头吾尔开希，于7月下旬从巴黎飞到美国后，顿时成了那里的“风云人物”，不是“应邀”出席丰盛宴会，就是被抬到大小会场“讲演”，一会儿从芝加哥奔赴华盛顿国会山“朝拜”，一会儿又从东海岸飞到西海岸。美国国会中少数政客、台湾在美形形色色御用组织以及美国和台湾的新闻媒介把他吹捧为“民主斗士”、“民族英雄”等等。
    吾尔开希对这一切甚感得意，变得更加目空一切，狂妄自大。为了报恩，他决心在这个“自由世界”里大大表演一番，其特点是造谣、骂人和空喊口号，大概他认为这样更可“骂龙成名”。然而，动机与效果并非总是成正比，正是他的一系列低劣表演使越来越多的留学生、华侨和美国公众看清了这个政治暴发户既非“斗士”，亦非“英雄”，有些一度“崇拜”他的人也渐渐感到失望。不少正直的美国朋友，爱国华侨，甚至台湾留学生和学者私下里说：“吾尔开希只不过一个爱出风头的跳梁小丑而已。”
    政客手中的玩物
    吾尔开希从踏上美国国土的那天起，就身不由己地任人摆布。美国政府专门派了安全人员作他的“保镖”，24小时形影不离。
    美国少数反动势力、台湾北美事务协调委员会的一些人以及披着联合报系美加新闻中心记者外衣活动的台湾大陆留学生工作组成员和台湾控制的各种侨社组织，加上反动组织“中国民联”等一伙人，对吾尔开希的活动进行了精心策划。吾尔开希到达美国后头两天，他们故意不让他露面，制造一点神秘气氛，接着就安排他先在美国电视台接受专访，随及由台湾在纽约的喉舌《世界日报》发表文章鼓励他公开活动后，他们就组织了一个又一个“欢迎会”、“讲演会”和“记者招待会”，千方百计钻进白宫和国会去游说美国高级官员出来“接见”，呼吁他们支持吾尔开希等几个叛逃分子反对中国政府的活动，以达到离间和破坏中美关系的目的。
    美国国会中少数政客对吾尔开希的到来也如获至宝，认为又可以利用他投机一番，有的赶忙出来接见，有的颁发“奖章”，有的设家宴陪乘游艇，……一位暂时不希望披露姓名的美国资深记者看到这种情况后一针见血地指出：“吾尔开希这个中国青年只不过是议员们手中的玩物而已。”他说：“这些议员，他们向来是为了捞取选票，既可无视国际关系准则，也可不顾自己的人格和身份，不管什么样的‘风流人物’都可拥抱接吻，只要能保证会后继续登上名利双收的议员宝座就行。”
    会见国民党头目决非偶然
    7月25日傍晚，吾尔开希自巴黎抵达芝加哥，是为了参加所谓的“全美中国学生学者代表大会”的。可是，他一下飞机，却撇下到机场“欢迎”他的大陆留学生，乘车直奔一位所谓的“医生”家里去会见国民党海外工作会主任郑心雄。这位“医生”是芝加哥台湾同乡联谊会会长吴英毅，他是所谓“美中支援大陆民主委员会”的发起者和组织者。
    吾尔开希会见郑心雄的消息很快在大陆留学生团体和广大中国留学生中传开，反应强烈。国民党特务一看情况不妙，赶忙叫吴英毅出来为吾尔开希摆脱困境献计，说：“最好由吾尔开希自己出来解释，以澄清不必要的误解。”吾尔开希也慌了手脚，害怕这个不可告人的秘密行动一曝光将损害他的“英雄”形象，慌慌张张地连夜分别打电话给在美国各地中国留学生团体负责人进行解释，诡称他“事前不知情”。
    然而，任何遁辞都掩盖不了“会见”的事实。众所周知，郑心雄选在中国留学生芝加哥大会召开前夕专程从台湾赶到美国，就像台湾在纽约出版的《时报周刊》所透露的那样，目的就是来做大陆留学生工作，“支持”他们的所谓“民主运动”。
    无知而又狂妄
    吾尔开希在一片吹捧声中当上了“政治明星”，处处以学生“领袖”自居，屡次在公开场合自嘲为“1989年最佳布景”。纽约华文报纸《世界日报》报道说，吾尔开希“自信地说自己理论水平高，民运经验够，组织能力强，足以担当领导大任。”
    且不说有不少中国学生特别是北京师范大学的学生知道吾尔开希的底细，就是外国人和华侨看到他这副狂妄的样子也开始感到厌恶。洛杉矶出版的华文报纸《国际日报》在一篇社论中说：“一位台湾的留学生表示对吾尔开希自视过高，开口闭口代表大陆留学生，认为极其反感。”
    尤其令人嗤笑的是他对美国前国务卿基辛格那种蛮不讲理的攻击。基辛格最近在美国报刊上发表文章，从国际战略格局和美国的长远利益考虑，只是劝导美国政府勿再对中国采取进一步的制裁措施，他在谈到天安门事件时说：“世界上没有任何一个政府会容忍在其首都的主要广场，被几万名游行示威者占领达8个星期之久。”吾尔开希知道这些话对他在国会和其他场所散布的谣言不利，就破口大骂基辛格博士“无耻”、“胡说八道”、“狗屁不通”等等。哥伦比亚大学的一位访问学者说：“想不到吾尔开希的水平这么差，他除了唱高调、喊口号和谩骂之外，肚子里真没有什么货。”
    《世界日报》对他如此低劣的水平甚为着急，也流露出一点不满，用批评的口气说：要在美国进行有效的游说，“不能靠尖锐的措词和口号”，而“需要仔细拟出投合西方价值观念、具体、诚实的说词”。最近，吾尔开希表示要到台湾“访问”，也许到那里受训一番可能达到《世界日报》所期望的那种水平。
