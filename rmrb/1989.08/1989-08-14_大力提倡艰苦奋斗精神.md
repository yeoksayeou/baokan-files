The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee solemnly proposed to carry out hard work and self-denial education. This is an important aspect of strengthening ideological and political work at present, and a significant and targeted issue facing the entire Party.

We advocate the spirit of hard work and self-denial because it is determined by the difficulties and tasks we currently face, and more importantly, by the characteristics of the historical development stage in which our country is situated and the goals our Party aims to achieve in this historical stage. Currently, there are still many difficulties in our economic construction, and the tasks of rectification and deepening reform are arduous. We need to reduce the scale of fixed asset investment, control the rapid growth of consumption funds, and tighten our belts for a few years. This requires the entire Party and the people of the whole country to carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-denial. However, this does not mean that advocating hard work and self-denial is merely a temporary measure. As is known to all, our country is still in the primary stage of socialism, with a low level of productive forces development, and both the economic and cultural foundations are relatively backward. It is not easy to achieve a moderately prosperous society by the end of this century, and it is even more arduous to reach the level of a moderately developed country in the world by the middle of the next century. Apart from long-term hard work and self-denial, we have no other choice. There is no such thing as a free lunch, and gold coins do not grow on trees. Comfort and ease will not achieve modernization. Every economically and culturally developed country in the world has gone through a period of national struggle and hard work. Moreover, modernization is not a static concept. While we are advancing, others are also advancing; while we are struggling, others are also struggling. To stand firm in fierce competition, to gradually catch up with relatively developed countries in economics, science, technology, and other fields, how can we achieve this without exerting more effort, sweating more, and working harder than others?

Advocating hard work and self-denial is not only significant for material civilization construction but is also an important part of spiritual civilization construction, an important part of rectifying party style and social ethics, and an important part of cultivating and fostering tens of millions of "four-haves" new people. Hard work and self-denial reflect a spirit of striving upward and progressing, a spirit of fearlessness in the face of any difficulties and pressures, and a spirit of dedication to the interests of the people. This spirit embodies the essence of the Chinese working class and people of all ethnic groups, the essence of the Communist Party of China, and the essence of the socialist system. For this reason, the basic line determined by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party especially emphasizes the need to carry forward the spirit of "hard work and pioneering." Only by understanding the significance of hard work and self-denial in this way can we consciously and consistently advocate and carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-denial.

Since our country entered a new historical development period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized the need to strengthen ideological and political work and carry out education on hard work, self-denial, and pioneering. However, the comrades in charge of major leadership work in the Central Committee have not seriously implemented this, and instead, they have seriously neglected ideological and political work and advocated high consumption, among other things. Due to the guidance of this wrong ideology and other reasons, a trend of pursuing enjoyment and competing for luxury has become increasingly rampant within the Party and society, leading to a reversal where extravagance and waste are considered honorable and thrift is considered shameful. Many cadres and the masses have been affected, and especially a large number of young people who are inexperienced in the world have been poisoned. For a period of time, the Jian'gang Mountain spirit, Long March spirit, Yan'an spirit, Daqing spirit, Mengtai spirit, Iron Man spirit, Lei Feng spirit, and Jiao Yulu spirit that we created in the practice of revolution and construction seem to have become outdated and useless. This phenomenon is not isolated but is a prominent manifestation of the failure to consistently uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and the rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization. The lack of effective education on hard work and self-denial is one of our major mistakes. The lessons are profound. In the future, while strengthening the education on the Four Cardinal Principles and ideological and political work, we should regard the education on hard work, self-denial, and pioneering as an important and indispensable content. This is especially important for the broad masses of young people. Of course, education should be effective and not mechanically apply outdated methods from the past. It should be combined with patriotic education, life philosophy education, revolutionary tradition education, and labor education, and be carried out in a lively and vivid manner.

Here, it is necessary to clarify: the hard work and self-denial we advocate is not a concept limited to the scope of life but a concept that runs through the entire process of production, work, and life. It is a concept that runs through all practical activities of a person. To achieve the great goal of revitalizing China, it is completely correct for us to carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-denial in life, to live within our means, to be diligent and thrifty, to pay attention to saving, and to oppose waste. However, this is not enough; we must also carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-denial in work, production, and the cause of reform and opening up. With our wisdom and hard work, we should create more and better material and spiritual products for the motherland and the people, promote the rapid development of productive forces, promote the overall progress of society, and promote the improvement of people's material and cultural living standards. "Diligence is the money tree, and thrift is the treasure pot." Diligence and thrift are two aspects of the spirit of hard work and self-denial, and neither can be lacking. In a sense, hard work in work is a more decisive factor. How much treasure the "treasure pot" can gather ultimately depends on how much money the "money tree" can shake down.

To make the people of the whole country continuously carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-denial, while focusing on education, we should gradually establish a mechanism through reform that encourages people to work hard. In recent years, with the development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, the spirit of hard work and self-denial has been neglected, forgotten, and even despised. This is not only related to the neglect of propaganda and education but also to the important reason that a mechanism that encourages people to work hard has not been completely established. What kind of mechanism is a mechanism that encourages people to work hard? Is it the iron rice bowl, lifelong tenure, and the iron rice bowl system? Of course not. These things will only cultivate and promote laziness, laziness, not working for a living, complacency, and lack of ambition. Only by breaking these things, universally implementing the production and operation responsibility system, work post responsibility system, and contract responsibility system that are closely related to family interests and personal interests, universally implementing equal competition, and truly implementing the system of obtaining remuneration according to the size of contributions rather than other standards, and so on, can a mechanism that encourages people to work hard be established. Under this mechanism, if a person does not strive to work hard and contribute more to society, they will face a crisis, will fall behind in society, and will be eliminated by fierce competition. Our economic system reform, political system reform, and cultural system reform are precisely to establish such a mechanism that fully mobilizes the enthusiasm, creativity, struggle spirit, and pioneering spirit of all members of society, full of vitality.

Hard work and self-denial are not only requirements for the broad masses of the people but more importantly, requirements for cadres at all levels. Whether cadres at all levels set an example has a great impact on the whole society. The history of our Party has repeatedly proven that for a cadre to gain the support of the masses, they must first work hard themselves and second, care about the sufferings of the masses. If the leader only advocates "hard work and self-denial" in words but actually pursues comfort and enjoyment, then how many people will believe what you say? The only result will be to encourage extravagance and corruption. In recent years, the spirit of hard work and self-denial in society has gradually weakened, which is greatly related to some leading cadres competing with each other in material enjoyment by taking advantage of their positions. The greatest concern and worry of the people is precisely this. Before a new mechanism that is conducive to hard work and self-denial is established, the exemplary role of leading cadres at all levels is of decisive significance. Advocating the spirit of hard work and pioneering helps to overcome corruption and helps to maintain close ties with the masses. Comrade Deng Xiaoping as early as 1980 called for "our Party members and cadres, especially high-level cadres, to make every effort to restore the glorious tradition of Yan'an, learn from the example of Comrade Zhou Enlai and others, and set an example in hard work and pioneering." In recent years, many comrades have done well, some have not done very well, and a few have even done very poorly, failing to meet the standard. This is worth serious reflection. Recently, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Several Things That the Masses Care About in the Near Future" and is implementing it resolutely and step by step. In the construction of clean government, new steps have been taken. Leading organs and cadres at all levels should seriously implement the spirit of the decision of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, quickly improve their understanding, take action, and truly set an example in hard work and self-denial, so that the fine tradition of hard work and self-denial can shine with new luster.

Rectification and deepening reform cannot be separated from hard work and self-denial. The realization of the Four Modernizations and the revitalization of China cannot be separated from hard work and self-denial. The fate of the Chinese nation depends on hard work and self-denial. May the four characters "hard work and self-denial" forever become our motto.

    大力提倡艰苦奋斗精神
    本报评论员
    党的十三届四中全会郑重提出要努力开展艰苦奋斗的教育。这是当前加强思想政治工作的一项重要内容，是摆在全党面前的很有针对性的一个重要课题。
    我们提倡艰苦奋斗精神，是我们目前面临的困难和任务所决定的，更是由我国所处的历史发展阶段的特点和我们党在这个历史阶段要实现的目标所决定的。我国当前在经济建设方面还存在着许多困难，治理整顿、深化改革的任务很重。要压缩固定资产投资规模，控制消费基金的过快增长，过几年紧日子，需要全党和全国人民发扬艰苦奋斗精神。但这绝不是说提倡艰苦奋斗只是一种权宜之计。众所周知，我国还处在社会主义初级阶段，生产力发展的水平还很低，经济基础和文化基础都相当落后，要在本世纪末达到小康水平并非易事，要在下个世纪中叶达到世界上中等发达国家的水平更是十分艰巨，除了长期艰苦奋斗，我们别无选择。天上不会掉下馅饼，地下不会生出金币。舒舒服服不可能实现现代化。世界上任何一个经济文化发达的国家，无不经过一个全民奋起、艰苦奋斗的历程。况且，现代化不是一个静止的概念。我们在前进，人家也在前进；我们在奋斗，人家也在奋斗。要想在激烈的竞争中站住脚，要想在经济、科学、技术等领域逐步赶上比较发达的国家，不比人家多花力气、多流汗水、多费心血，怎么可能呢？
    提倡艰苦奋斗，不仅对物质文明建设有重要意义，它本身就是精神文明建设的重要内容，是正党风、正社会风气的重要内容，是培育、造就亿万“四有”新人的重要内容。艰苦奋斗，表现出一种奋发向上、锐意进取的精神，一种不怕任何困难和压力的精神，一种为人民利益而乐于奉献的精神，这种精神体现了中国工人阶级和各族劳动人民的本色，中国共产党的本色，社会主义制度的本色。也正因为如此，党的十三大确定的基本路线，特别提出要发扬“艰苦创业”的精神。只有这样来认识艰苦奋斗的意义，才能自觉地一贯地提倡和发扬艰苦奋斗精神。
    自从我国进入历史发展的新时期以来，邓小平同志多次强调要加强思想政治工作，抓好艰苦奋斗、艰苦朴素、艰苦创业的教育。但是在中央担负主要领导工作的同志并没有认真贯彻，相反，却严重忽视思想政治工作，提倡高消费等等。由于这种错误思想的指导，加上其他一些原因，使党内和社会上一股贪图享受、攀比奢华的歪风愈演愈烈，以至出现以铺张浪费为荣、勤俭节约为耻的颠倒，使很多干部和群众受到侵蚀，特别是使大量涉世未深的青年受到毒害。一段时间以来，我们在革命和建设的实践中创造出来的井冈山精神、长征精神、延安精神、大庆精神、孟泰精神、铁人精神、雷锋精神、焦裕禄精神似乎都过时了，不管用了。这种现象并不是孤立出现的，而是坚持四项基本原则不够一贯、资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥在一个方面的突出表现。艰苦奋斗的教育少而不得力，是我们很大的失误之一。教训是深刻的。今后，在加强四项基本原则的教育、加强思想政治工作的过程中，应当把艰苦奋斗、艰苦朴素、艰苦创业教育作为重要的、不可或缺的内容，对广大青少年更应当加强这方面的教育。当然，教育要得法，要讲求实效，不能机械地套用过去的某些过时的做法，要结合爱国主义教育、人生观教育、革命传统教育、劳动教育等一道，生动活泼地开展起来。
    在这里，需要明确：我们所说的艰苦奋斗不是一个只限于生活范围的概念，而是一个贯穿于生产、工作、生活的全过程的概念，是贯穿于人的全部实践活动的概念。要实现振兴中华的远大目标，我们在生活上发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，量入为出，克勤克俭，注意节约，反对浪费，是完全正确的。但是仅限于此还不够，还要在工作、生产和改革开放的事业中发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，以自己的智慧和辛勤劳动，为祖国、为人民创造更多更好的物质产品和精神产品，促进生产力的迅速发展，促进社会的全面进步，促进人们物质文化生活水平的提高。“勤是摇钱树，俭是聚宝盆”。勤与俭是艰苦奋斗精神的两个方面，缺一不可。从某种意义上说，工作上的艰苦奋斗是更有决定意义的东西。“聚宝盆”能聚多少宝，根本上还是取决于“摇钱树”能摇下多少钱来。
    要使全国人民持续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，在抓紧教育的同时，要注意通过改革逐步建立起促使人们艰苦奋斗的机制。近几年，随着经济的发展和人们生活水平的提高，艰苦奋斗的精神之所以被冷落、被淡忘、甚至被鄙弃，固然同忽视宣传、教育有关，还有一个重要原因就是没有完全建立起一种促使人们艰苦奋斗的机制。什么机制是促使人们艰苦奋斗的机制呢？是大锅饭、铁饭碗、终身制吗？当然不是。这些东西只会培植和助长懈怠、懒惰、不劳而获、安于现状、不思进取等萎靡消极的情绪。只有打破这些东西，普遍实行与家庭利益、个人利益密切相关的生产经营责任制、工作岗位责任制、承包经营责任制，普遍实行平等竞争，真正实行按照贡献大小而不是按照其他标准获取报酬的制度，等等，才是促使人们艰苦奋斗的机制。在这种机制下，一个人如果不奋力拚搏，努力为社会多做贡献，那就会面临危机，就会在社会上落伍，就会为激烈的竞争所淘汰。我们进行经济体制改革、政治体制改革、文化体制改革，正是要建立起这样一种充分调动社会全体成员的积极性、创造性、奋斗精神、创业精神的充满活力的机制。
    艰苦奋斗不只是对广大人民群众的要求，更主要的是对各级领导干部的要求。各级领导干部是否以身作则，对整个社会有极大的影响。我们党的历史反复证明，一个干部要得到群众拥护，一要自身艰苦奋斗，二要关心群众疾苦。如果领导者只是口头上说“艰苦奋斗”，而实际上却贪图安逸、追求享受，那么你讲的那一套有多少人相信呢？唯一的结果只能是助长奢靡之风、腐败之风。近些年来，社会上艰苦奋斗的风气日渐淡薄，同一些领导干部在物质享受上利用职权竞相攀比有极大关系。人民群众最大的忧虑、最大的担心也正在于此。在有利于艰苦奋斗的新机制建立起来之前，各级领导干部的表率作用具有决定的意义。提倡艰苦创业精神，有助于克服腐败现象，有助于密切联系群众。邓小平同志早在1980年就号召“我们的党员、干部，特别是高级干部，一定要努力恢复延安的光荣传统，努力学习周恩来等同志的榜样，在艰苦创业方面起模范作用”。这些年来，很多同志是做得好的，有些同志却做得不大好，少数同志甚至做得很不好，不及格。这是值得认真反思的。最近，中央政治局通过了《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》，并正在坚决地有步骤地贯彻实施，在廉政建设上迈出了新步子。各级领导机关和领导干部要认真贯彻中央政治局的决定精神，尽快提高认识，拿出行动，在艰苦奋斗方面真正发挥模范作用，使艰苦奋斗的优良传统焕发出新的光彩。
    治理整顿、深化改革，离不开艰苦奋斗。实现四化、振兴中华，离不开艰苦奋斗。中华民族的前途和命运系于艰苦奋斗。愿“艰苦奋斗”四个大字，永远成为我们的座右铭。
