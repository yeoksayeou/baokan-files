Recently, some individuals pretending to be spiritual or supernatural have infiltrated both urban and rural areas of our county, engaging in activities such as fortune-telling, palm reading, and divination. Many students initially approach these practices out of curiosity but gradually begin to imitate and believe in them. Some students copy and share books on fortune-telling, palm reading, and divination, and even practice these activities among themselves. Others use their free time, weekends, and holidays to visit places with statues of deities, burning incense and candles, and kneeling in worship.

In early April of last year, a high school student and three junior high school students from a certain township went to the west gate tunnel of Quxian City on a Sunday to consult a fortune-teller. The fortune-teller held the hands of the four students and said, "Your fortunes are excellent. Some of you will be able to attend key universities and become officials, while others will be able to attend vocational schools." The students generously gave the fortune-teller 10 and 15 yuan each. As a result, the high school student did not get into a university and went mad, while the junior high school students also failed to get into vocational schools. One student named Zhang even committed suicide by drowning. There was also a female student in the third year of junior high school who was a math prodigy and had won first place in the county's math competition. In mid-June of this year, a fortune-teller told her, "Your forehead is full and your palm has a purple mark, indicating a strong literary star. You will definitely get into a vocational school this year." The student became complacent and relaxed her studies, failing to even reach the preliminary selection line, and regretted it deeply.

If such problems are allowed to spread unchecked, they will seriously affect the healthy growth of middle and primary school students. It is suggested that schools at all levels should regard the elimination of superstitions as an important part of building a spiritually civilized school. They should organize various science popularization lectures to expose the deceptive nature of feudal superstitions. Parents should also educate their children not to believe in gods and ghosts. Relevant departments should take effective measures to crack down on superstitious activities.

    中小学生信神信鬼令人忧
    建议加强无神论教育
    近来，一些装神弄鬼的人窜到我县城乡，看相、算命、测字和求神。不少学生开始是好奇，逐渐到模仿相信。有的传抄看相、测字算命等类书籍，相互之间看相算命。有的学生利用课余、星期天和节假日到一些有菩萨的地方去焚香点烛，顶礼膜拜。
    去年4月上旬，某乡有一名高中生和3名初中生利用星期天到渠县城西门隧道口找一位算命先生算命。那位算命先生拉着这4位学生的手说：“你们的命太好了，有的能考进重点大学当官，有的能考上中专。”学生们一个个很大方地拿出了10元、15元钱给算命先生。结果那位高中生没有考上大学气疯癫了，几名初中生也没考上中专，其中有名姓张的学生跳水自杀了。有名初中三年级女学生，是数学尖子，曾经获得县数学竞赛第一名。今年6月中旬，一个算命先生对她说：“你天庭饱满，印中带紫，主文曲星运，今年考上中专十拿九稳。”这位学生沾沾自喜，从此放松学习，结果连预选线都未上，后悔莫及。
    这类问题，任其泛滥下去，会严重影响中小学生的健康成长。建议各地中小学把破除迷信的教育作为加强学校精神文明建设的重要内容来抓，举办各种科普讲座，揭露封建迷信活动骗人的实质；家长也要教育子女不要信神侍鬼；有关部门应采取有效措施，打击迷信活动。
