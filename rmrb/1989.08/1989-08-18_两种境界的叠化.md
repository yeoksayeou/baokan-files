Through the television program *The Dance Art of Yang Liping*, we can fully appreciate Yang Liping's dance art. The director, Zheng Ming, briefly introduces the protagonist's experiences in the opening credits, and then allows us to quietly feel the beauty of the young dancer in the slow music and scenes.

This is a television program where all the shots are edited using the overlay technique. In this constantly changing time and space, the spirit of nature is stirred on Yang Liping's fingers, sometimes like flowing raindrops, sometimes like a proud peacock. The colors also change with her dance movements: sometimes it's the "Three Colors of Xishuangbanna," sometimes it's the "Spirit of the Peacock" ... Yang Liping's artistic world is clear and pure.

The television program also shows us the dancer's artistic life. The clear handprints on the practice ground overlay into the swaying head of a peacock. She leaps lightly like petals falling after the rain. Even when applying makeup, a single feather gives a sense of the sanctity of art. Her dance is like her life. The director condenses these two arts on the stage and practice room, not only showing the skill of writing about a person through dance, but also expressing a tribute to the life embodied in Yang Liping's dance art.

This beautifully made television program does not focus on narrating ordinary experiences when filming people, nor does it emphasize the presentation of scenes when filming dances. It quietly flows, allowing you to unknowingly enter a profound realm. At this time, the lighting seems to have a spirit, outlining the dancer's hand into the contour light of a peacock's head, which is unforgettable; the red light at the end of the program, with Yang Liping's running, exudes a kind of vitality and strength. Through the overlay of the shots, whether it is the rhythm or the connection of the scenes, it exudes a kind of charm, achieving an effect that is difficult to reach when appreciating on stage.

Beauty is generous, but also stingy. Deep beauty requires an artist with keen insight. Zheng Ming's television program is like a spring of beauty, sending it into your heart, and we still deeply feel the realm of life that the dancer pursues.

    两种境界的叠化
    王永午
    通过电视片《杨丽萍的舞蹈艺术》，我们可以尽情欣赏杨丽萍的舞蹈艺术。编导郑鸣在片头用字幕扼要介绍女主人公的经历，接着便让我们在徐缓的音乐和画面中静静感受年轻舞蹈家其人其舞的美好境界。
    这是一部镜头组接全部采用叠化形式的电视片。在这不断叠化不断变化的时空中，大自然的灵性激扬在杨丽萍的手指上，忽而是流丽的雨丝，忽而是高傲的孔雀。色彩也随着她的舞姿在我们眼前变幻：一会儿是“版纳三色”，一会儿是“雀之灵”……杨丽萍的艺术世界清朗而纯净。
    电视片还向我们展示了舞蹈家的艺术生活。练功场上清晰的掌印叠化出孔雀头摆动。她轻轻一跃弹如雨后的落英。化妆时，即使带一翎羽毛也让人领悟到一种艺术的神圣感。她的舞蹈恰似她的人生。编导将这两种艺术浓缩在舞台和练功房中，不仅表现出以舞写人结构上挥洒自如的功力，也透出对杨丽萍舞蹈艺术所体现的生命的礼赞。
    这部制作精美的电视片，拍人却不侧重讲述一般经历，拍舞也不讲求场面的铺陈。它静静地流泻让你不知不觉中进入一个深邃的境界。这时候，灯光也似乎有了灵性，将舞蹈家的手勾成孔雀头的轮廓光，令人难忘；片尾的红光，随着杨丽萍的奔跑透出一种朝气，一种骨力。通过镜头的叠化，无论节奏还是场景的衔接，都逸出一种神韵，收到了在舞台上欣赏所难以达到的效果。
    美很慷慨，又很吝啬。深邃的美需要艺术家独具慧眼，郑鸣的这部电视片只是把美的感觉泉水般地往你心里送，我们还是深深感觉到了舞蹈家所追求的人生境界。
