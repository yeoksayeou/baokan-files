This year marks the 70th anniversary of "Saturday Voluntary Labor." On April 22, the 119th anniversary of Lenin's birth, which also happened to be a Saturday, a retired worker from the Moscow-Bryansk Railway, who had participated in over 50 "Saturday Voluntary Labor" events, sounded the familiar whistle at the famous Moscow-Sokolnikovo Depot, signaling the start of this year's "Red Saturday." From the shores of the Pacific to the Baltic Sea, from the cold scientific research stations within the Arctic Circle to the warm southern border towns, the entire Soviet Union became a bustling labor site. Even Tbilisi, which had experienced bloody riots just a few days earlier, saw a return to normal labor order.

On the evening of April 12, 1919, 13 Bolsheviks and two workers from the Moscow Sokolnikovo Depot did not go home after work. Instead, they worked for another 10 hours, repairing three damaged locomotives without asking for any payment. When they casually referred to this action as "Subbotnik" (Saturday Voluntary Labor), they never imagined that this would become the precursor to a great movement of the 20th century.

The term "Subbotnik" quickly spread along the Moscow-Bryansk Railway throughout the young Soviet state. People began to try a new, communist attitude towards their labor and life, linking the means of survival with a great pursuit and belief. By the spring of 1920, "Saturday Voluntary Labor" had developed into a nationwide activity, playing a very active role in restoring the national economy and consolidating the young Soviet government. Lenin joyfully referred to this form of labor as "the bud of communism," "a great initiative," and personally participated in the first all-Russian "Saturday Voluntary Labor" on May 1, 1920. The story of this great teacher and a common soldier competing to carry a log during this labor has long been a well-known tale among the Soviet people.

Seventy years have passed since then. "Saturday Voluntary Labor" has been a red historical bond tying together generations of Soviet people. In these 70 years, the Soviet people have organized countless voluntary labor activities, using the wealth created by these labors to build hospitals, schools, and sports fields; establish various social welfare funds; support national key projects; and aid refugees around the world. Since 1969, people have designated the Saturday before Lenin's birthday in the second half of April as the national voluntary labor day, proudly calling this day "Red Saturday." On this recognized memorial day, people voluntarily go to the streets, construction sites, or to their factories as usual. Various units and cities also establish special "Saturday Voluntary Labor Command Centers." Those on official business trips or vacations do not forget to work with the local masses on this day, and even diplomats and students studying abroad participate in some beneficial extra work in their own ways.

On this day, the first words people say to each other are greetings for the holiday. It is worth noting that this year's "Red Saturday" embodied the reform spirit advocated by the CPSU Central Committee. People actively proposed to oppose the formalism that appeared during the previous stagnant period, showing a more serious and responsible work attitude. "High efficiency, high quality" became the slogan for this "Saturday Voluntary Labor." In Moscow alone, laborers produced goods worth 29 million rubles, achieving the best results in the city's history of "Saturday Voluntary Labor." It is said that half of this money will be used to develop the city's medical and health services.

Reform has injected new vitality into "Saturday Voluntary Labor," and "Saturday Voluntary Labor" continuously renews itself through reform. Since the Soviet Union began its reforms, "Saturday Voluntary Labor" has been increasingly valued as an important means of conducting communist traditional education for the entire population. It constantly reminds people of the relationship between reform and Leninism, making people remember that the direction of reform is always socialism and communism. Someone has done statistics, and since 1983, the number of participants in each "Saturday Voluntary Labor" has been over 150 million, far exceeding the total number of registered workers in the Soviet Union, making it a true voluntary labor for the entire nation in the name of a belief, without any reward.

    伟大的创举——“星期六义务劳动”
    胡锡进
    今年是“星期六义务劳动”70周年。4月22日，列宁诞辰119周年这一天，又恰好是星期六。清晨，莫斯科——梁赞铁路一位参加过50多次“星期六义务劳动”的退休老工人在著名的莫斯科——索尔基洛夫车库的通道上拉响人们熟悉的汽笛，宣告了今年“红色星期六”的开始。从太平洋之滨到波罗的海沿岸，从寒冷的北极圈内的科学考察站到温暖的南部边界城镇，整个苏联成为一个沸沸扬扬的劳动工地，连4月初刚刚发生过流血骚乱的第比利斯也出现了正常的劳动秩序。
    1919年4月12日晚，莫斯科索尔基洛夫车库的13名布尔什维克和两名工人下班后没回家，他们继续苦干10个小时，修好三台损坏的机车，并且分文不取。当他们随口将这次行动叫做“苏鲍特尼克”即星期六义务劳动时，他们根本不曾想到，这次行动竟成为本世纪一场伟大运动的先导。
    “苏鲍特尼克”——这个新鲜词迅速沿着莫斯科——梁赞铁路传遍整个年轻的苏维埃国家。人们纷纷尝试着以一种新的、共产主义的态度对待他们的劳动和生活，把在过去仅仅用来谋求生存的手段与一种伟大的追求和信仰联系在一起。到了1920年春天，“星期六义务劳动”已发展成为一项具有全国规模的活动，为恢复国民经济、巩固年轻的苏维埃政权起着十分积极的作用。列宁欣喜地称这种劳动形式是“共产主义的萌芽”、“伟大的创举”，并亲自参加了1920年5月1日举行的第一次全俄“星期六义务劳动”。这位伟大的导师与一位普通士兵在这次劳动中争着抬圆木的粗头的故事，早已成为苏联人民家喻户晓的美谈。
    从那时起，整整70年过去了。“星期六义务劳动”像一条红色的历史纽带把一代代苏联人系结在一起。在这70年中，苏联人民举行过数不清的义务劳动，并用这些劳动创造的财富修建医院、学校、体育场；建立各种社会福利基金；支援国家重点工程建设；援助世界各地受灾的难民。从1969年起，人们把每年4月下半月列宁生日前后的一个星期六定为全国义务劳动日，并骄傲地将这一天称为“红色星期六”。每到这个公认的纪念日，人们便主动走上街头，来到建筑工地，或像平时一样去工厂上班。各单位、城市还为此成立专门的“星期六义务劳动指挥部”。因公出差、外出度假的人忘不了在这一天与当地群众一起干点活，连在国外工作、学习的外交官和留学生也要用他们方便的形式做一些额外的有益工作。
    这一天人们见面的第一句话都是互致节日的问候。值得指出的是，今年的“红色星期六”体现了苏共中央倡导的改革精神。人们主动提出反对以往停滞时期出现过的形式主义，表现出比以往更加认真、严肃的工作态度。“高效率、高质量”成为这次“星期六义务劳动”的口号。仅在首都莫斯科，劳动者就生产出价值2900万卢布的产品，创造了这个城市历年“星期六义务劳动”的最好成绩。据说，这些钱的一半将用录于发展该市的医疗卫生事业。
    改革为“星期六义务劳动”注入新的活力，“星期六义务劳动”不断在改革中更新着自己。苏联开始改革以来，“星期六义务劳动”愈加受到重视，成为对全体人民进行共产主义传统教育的重要手段。它不断地提醒人们改革与列宁主义的关系，使人们牢记改革的方向永远是社会主义和共产主义。有人做过统计，1983年以来每一次“星期六义务劳动”的参加者都在1.5亿人以上，远远超过苏联在册的工作人员的总数，是名副其实的为一种信仰进行的、不计报酬的全民义务劳动。
