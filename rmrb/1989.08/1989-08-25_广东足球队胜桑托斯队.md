The Guangdong football team broke the unbeaten record of the Brazilian Santos football team in their visit to China. The match ended with Santos losing 1:2.

The renowned Santos football team has been in China since August 4, playing against six Chinese teams and maintaining an unbeaten record with 5 wins and 1 draw. However, this record was broken in their last match in Guangzhou.

The match started under the cheers of nearly 60,000 spectators. In the first half, Guangdong's attack and defense were slow, and they failed to organize a strong offensive in front of the opponent's goal. In the 38th minute, Santos' No. 5, Cesar Sampaio, headed the ball into the net after receiving a pass from his teammate on the right, scoring the first goal. In the second half, Guangdong substituted in national team players Wu Qunli and Guo Yijun and accelerated their offensive pace. Just 6 minutes into the second half, forward Wu Qunli scored in the chaos in front of the opponent's goal, equalizing the score. The atmosphere on the field became heated, and Guangdong's morale soared as they launched a massive offensive. In the 10th minute of the second half, Wu Qunli again scored a goal after receiving a pass from the left and breaking through the defense of two opponents, adding another point. Despite Santos' desperate counterattacks, Guangdong tightened their defense, occasionally counterattacking. With Socrates being tightly marked by Guangdong's No. 6, Cao Yang, Santos ultimately could not turn the tide.

The Brazilian Santos football team will depart Guangzhou for Hong Kong tomorrow.

    广东足球队胜桑托斯队
    新华社广州8月24日电  （记者张家昌、何惠飞）巴西桑托斯足球队访华比赛保持不败的纪录今天晚上在广州天河体育场被广东足球队打破，以1∶2败北。
    久负盛名的桑托斯足球队自8月4日访华以来，先后与我国6支球队交锋，获5胜1和的不败战绩。然而在广州的最后一场比赛中，这一纪录却未能保住。
    这场比赛在近6万观众的欢呼声中开始。上半场，广东队攻防节奏慢，没能在对方门前组织起强有力的进攻。第38分钟时，桑托斯队5号塞萨尔·桑巴伊奥在广东队禁区内接队友右侧妙传，一记头球攻门，先得1分。下半场，广东队及时换上国脚吴群立和郭亿军，并加快了进攻节奏。下半时开场仅6分钟，前锋吴群立在对方门前的混战中倒地把球踢入网内，扳回1分。顿时，场上气氛热烈，广东队气势如虹，大举进攻。下半时第10分钟时，又是吴群立在中路接得左边传球后，带球突破，并在对方两名后卫的夹击之下，将球劲射入网，再添1分。尔后，虽然桑托斯队竭力反攻，但广东队紧缩防区，时而反击，加上苏格拉底被广东队6号曹阳死死盯住，桑托斯队终于回天乏术。
    巴西桑托斯足球队将于明天离开广州前往香港。
