Standing in the southern part of Anhui Province, Mount Huang is a brilliant gem among China's famous mountains and rivers, and it is also a renowned mountain tourism destination worldwide. Within the 154-square-kilometer Mount Huang scenic area, towering peaks rise, ancient pines stand tall, clouds and seas spread out, and unique rocks are naturally formed. Birds sing in the valleys, and warm springs flow. Domestic and international tourists all praise the wonders of Mount Huang, calling it a "paradise on earth." In 1985, a nationwide selection of China's top ten famous scenic areas was conducted, and Mount Huang was chosen, being the only mountain scenic area, on par with the Great Wall and the Three Gorges.

Mount Huang is the most beautiful in all of China, but in the past, it was overgrown with thickets and weeds, and smoke from burning wood obscured the paths, hidden deep in the mountains and unknown to people. After liberation and until the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Mount Huang was still limited to accommodating internal recuperators. In 1979, Comrade Xiaoping inspected Mount Huang and made important instructions for the development of Mount Huang's tourism industry. Anhui Province officially announced the opening of Mount Huang to the outside world, and Mount Huang's rich tourism resources were quickly protected, developed, and utilized, becoming a new global tourism hotspot and attracting numerous foreign tourists. Now, Mount Huang's tourism infrastructure has taken initial shape, with luxurious modern facilities like the Taoyuan Hotel, the Yun Valley Resort with Ming and Qing Dynasty styles, and the West Sea Hotel, a Sino-Hong Kong joint venture in the full Nordic style. Over ten years of reform and opening up, the number of tourists to Mount Huang has increased by 40% annually. By the end of 1988, Mount Huang had received 9.3 million domestic and international tourists, including 400,000 inbound tourists, more than five times the total from 1950 to 1978. In 1986, Mount Huang completed the longest cable car in East Asia, the White Cloud Cableway, which increased the tourist flow.

The most beautiful spot in this mountain is the Yu Ping Pavilion. Nearby are several ancient pines over a thousand years old, named by ancient people as the "Greeting Pine," "Welcoming Pine," "Accompanying Pine," and "Seeing-Off Pine," which are quite thought-provoking. The most famous "Welcoming Pine" painting has been hanging in the Great Hall of the People to welcome distinguished guests from all over the world. The first lesson in training service staff at various hotels in Mount Huang is "sincerely welcoming guests with smiles." In March of this year, after visiting and touring Mount Huang, Steve and Mr. Chen, leaders of the American China Friendship Association, said: "The scenery of Mount Huang is magical, beyond imagination, making one feel as if in heaven; the people here are warm and hospitable, making us feel like living in paradise."

Surrounding Mount Huang, there are many other tourist attractions in Anhui Province, including the most famous of the "Three Rocks of the Yangtze River," Jishi Rock, one of the four major Buddhist sites, Jiuhua Mountain, one of the four major Taoist mountains, Qiyun Mountain, and the natural reserves of green jade Niubiejiang and Qingliang Peak.

Friends, come to Anhui, come to Mount Huang, the Welcoming Pine is stretching out its arms to welcome you!

    欲入仙境上黄山
    屹立于安徽南部的黄山，是中国名山胜水中一颗璀璨的明珠，也是享誉世界的山岳游览胜地。一百五十四平方公里的黄山风景区内，群峰耸峙，奇松苍挺，云海漫铺，巧石天成，鸟语幽谷，泻泉香温。海内外游客无不赞叹黄山奇观，称之为“人间仙境”。一九八五年，全国范围评选中国十大著名风景区，黄山中选，是其中唯一的山岳景区，与长城、三峡等齐名。
    黄山秀甲九州，但过去一直是榛莽菑翳，薪蒸蔽道，藏在深山人未知。解放后到十一届三中全会前，黄山仍局限于接待内部疗养者。一九七九年小平同志视察黄山，对发展黄山旅游事业作出了重要指示。安徽省正式宣布黄山对外开放，黄山丰富的旅游资源迅速得到保护、开发、利用，成为世界新兴的旅游热点，吸引了众多的国外旅游者。现在，黄山的旅游基础设施已初具规模，有豪华的现代化的桃源宾馆，有明清风格、古色古香的云谷山庄，还有中港合资全北欧式的西海饭店等。十年改革开放，黄山游客每年以百分之四十的速度递增，到一九八八年底，黄山接待中外游客达九百三十万人次，其中接待入境游客达四十万人次，比一九五○年至一九七八年之和增长了五倍多。一九八六年，黄山建成了远东最长的白云索道，增加了客流量。
    这座奇山风景最佳处是玉屏楼，旁边有几棵寿逾千年的古松，被古人分别命名为望客松、迎客松、陪客松、送客松，十分耐人寻味。最著名的迎客松铁画一直高挂在人民大会堂里迎接四海的贵宾。黄山各宾馆培训服务员第一课就是“以诚待客，微笑服务”。今年三月，美国美中友协领导人史迪夫和陈先生参观游览了黄山后说：“黄山景色神奇，真难以想象，使人仿佛置身天上；这里的人民热情好客，我们就像生活在天堂。”
    围绕黄山，安徽境内还有众多的旅游胜地，其中有“长江三矶”中最著名的采石矶，四大佛教胜地之一的九华山，道教四大名山之一的齐云山，绿色宝石牯牛降、清凉峰自然保护区等。
    朋友，到安徽去，到黄山去，迎客松正伸出双臂欢迎您！
