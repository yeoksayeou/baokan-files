Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th August

The mastermind of a major economic fraud case, Zhang Zhenzhong, who was wanted by Chinese public security authorities, was extradited by Chinese police from the Philippines on the afternoon of August 10.

Zhang Zhenzhong, a 34-year-old male from Lankao County, Henan Province, was an employee of Qinghai Provincial Material Service Company before the case. In June 1988, Zhang Zhenzhong colluded with domestic and foreign criminals to defraud 2.4 million yuan from Qinghai Provincial Material Service Company under the pretense of purchasing cars. He then exchanged the money for foreign currency in Guangdong and fled the country. In October of the same year, he changed his name to Zhang Qinghai and used a forged Philippine passport to escape to Manila.

Chinese public security authorities investigated the criminal facts of Zhang Zhenzhong. After the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines made extensive efforts to verify Zhang's situation in the Philippines, they contacted the Philippine authorities through diplomatic and Interpol channels. The Philippine Immigration Bureau verified Zhang's identity and, finding that he was illegally residing in the Philippines, detained him and agreed to hand him over to the Chinese authorities. After negotiations between the two countries, Chinese public security authorities sent three officers to Manila on August 10. After completing the handover procedures at the Manila airport, they escorted Zhang back to China on the same flight.

A responsible person from the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security said today that the extradition of Zhang was fully cooperated by the Philippine Immigration Bureau and other relevant authorities, for which they express their gratitude. After Zhang is extradited back to China, he will be tried by the public security authorities, procuratorates, and courts of Qinghai Province and will be punished according to the law.

    重大经济诈骗案主犯张振忠由我警方自菲律宾押解回国
    新华社北京8月11日电　被我公安机关通缉的重大经济诈骗案主犯张振忠，8月10日下午由中国警方自菲律宾押解回国。
    张振忠，男，34岁，河南省兰考县人，案发前系青海省物资服务公司的聘用人员。1988年6月，张振忠与境内外不法分子勾结，以购买汽车为名诈骗青海省物资服务公司人民币240万元，在广东倒换成外汇后携款出逃。同年10月，他化名张青海，持伪造的菲律宾护照逃往马尼拉市。
    我公安机关查明张振忠犯罪事实，经中国驻菲使馆多方努力，核查张犯在菲律宾的情况后，即通过外交渠道和国际刑警渠道与菲律宾方面联系。菲律宾移民局对张振忠的身份进行了核查，鉴于张在菲律宾系非法居留，遂将其拘留，并表示交与中方。中菲双方经协商，我公安机关于8月10日派出三名警官赴马尼拉，在马尼拉机场完成交接手续后，乘原机将张犯押解回国。
    公安部刑侦局负责人今天说，押解张犯回国之事，得到了菲律宾移民局等有关方面的充分合作，对此表示感谢。张犯被押回国内后，将由青海省公安机关、检察院、人民法院负责审理，依法惩处。
