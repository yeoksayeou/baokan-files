Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 19th

Audit agencies have conducted follow-up audits and discovered that the actual reduction in ongoing projects is minimal, while many stopped projects are listed falsely. Over 500 projects continue construction despite the ban.

According to the audit agencies' follow-up audits of projects that have been decided to stop or slow down, only a few of these projects have actually been reduced. Most are projects that have not started or are in the planning stage.

Since March this year, audit agencies across the country have conducted follow-up audits on fixed asset investment projects that have been decided to stop or slow down. So far, 7,526 projects have been audited. However, the audit found that most of these so-called stopped or slowed projects are either projects that have not started or are in the planning stage. In the projects audited by Nanjing, 51 projects are in the intention stage and have not incurred any expenses, accounting for 54%; 23 projects have been approved but have not started, accounting for 24%; only 16 projects are actually under construction, accounting for 17%. In the 45 projects audited by the Shanghai Special Office, 36 projects have not started or do not have the conditions to start, accounting for 80%.

The follow-up audit also found that 508 ongoing projects are not executing the stop or slow down decisions and are still under construction, with a total investment of 870 million yuan. These projects either use the excuse of awaiting review; or use the pretext of changing production to deceive; or change the project name and start a new one, engaging in "relay" construction. There are over 240 such projects in Hunan and Hubei provinces alone, with a total investment of over 200 million yuan.

According to Chen Guangjian, director of the State Council's Office for the Cleanup of Ongoing Projects, the current reasons why the scale of fixed asset investment cannot be reduced are: first, local and enterprise interests drive the pursuit of projects and scale; second, each region has its own demands, with coastal regions demanding leniency and inland regions demanding to catch up with developed regions, making it difficult to reduce investment; third, the decentralization of approval authority has led to management chaos; fourth, there are many types of special funds, and the "cage" cannot contain them.

Deputy Auditor General Zheng Li believes that for projects that continue construction despite the ban and for issues related to poor management of follow-up work, the handling cannot be left unresolved.

### 审计机关跟踪审计发现  在建工程实压甚少  停缓项目虚列居多  五百多项目有禁不止仍在施工

    审计机关跟踪审计发现
    在建工程实压甚少  停缓项目虚列居多
    五百多项目有禁不止仍在施工
    据新华社北京8月19日电　（通讯员王倩、记者傅刚）据审计机关对停缓建项目的跟踪审计发现，真正压缩的在建项目只是少数，而多数是虚列的在建项目。
    据了解，今年3月以来，各地审计机关对已决定停缓建的固定资产投资项目普遍开展了跟踪审计，目前已审计7526个项目。但审计发现，这些所谓的停缓建项目大部分都是未开工的和规划中的项目。南京市审计的停缓建项目中，处于意向阶段，并未发生费用开支的有51个，占54％；已立项尚未开工的有23个，占24％；确属在建的只有16个，仅占17％。上海特派员办事处审计的45个项目中，未开工和不具备开工条件的有36个，占80％。
    跟踪审计还发现，共有508个在建项目不执行停缓建决定，仍在继续施工，总投资8.7亿元。这些项目，有的借口等待复议；有的以转产为名弄虚作假；有的改头换面重新立项，搞“接力”建设。这类有禁不止的建设单位仅湖南、湖北两省就有240多个，总投资2亿多元。
    据国务院清理在建项目办公室主任陈光健分析，当前固定资产投资规模压不下来的原因，一是地方、企业的利益机制牵动上项目、争规模；二是各地都有自己的要求，沿海地区要求网开一面，内地要求跟上发达地区，因此压缩投资下不了决心；三是审批权层层下放，致使管理混乱；四是多种专用资金名目繁多，“笼子”装不下。
    审计署副审计长郑力认为，对于有禁不止、继续施工的项目，对于善后工作管理不力等问题的处理，不能不了了之。
