Contemporary renowned performer Laurence Olivier passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 82. However, his life was anything but peaceful.

On July 15, four days after his passing, I watched the biographical documentary "The Life of Olivier" and his 1980s performance in Shakespeare's tragedy "King Lear." His tumultuous yet brilliant life, his sincere and deeply convincing performances, how could they not make one admire and respect him?

"King Lear" is the crowning achievement of Olivier's later artistic career, praised by the film industry as an "unparalleled" accomplishment.

Like many artists, Olivier did not have a happy childhood.

He lost his mother in his early years and grew up in poverty. With his father's support, he entered the magical world of theater.

At the age of 10, he performed as Brutus in "Julius Caesar." At 15, he took on roles in Shakespeare's works. At 17, he was admitted to the London Central School of Speech and Drama, and two years later, he spent three years honing his craft at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, becoming a professional actor.

During this period, he thoroughly read all of Shakespeare's works and deeply studied all the important roles in Shakespearean plays, laying a solid foundation for his future acting career. In the mid-1930s, he successfully starred in "Romeo and Juliet" and "Hamlet" at the famous Old Vic Theatre in London, gaining fame and establishing an unshakable position in the British theater world.

He then went to the United States to film "Wuthering Heights," "Rebecca," and "Pride and Prejudice," becoming internationally famous.

In his pursuit of art, he never stopped advancing.

Over 50 years, he played various roles in more than 120 plays, over 50 films, and 15 television dramas.

However, Olivier's greatest achievement was not in creating countless distinct characters or leaving a deep impression on audiences with his flawless acting. It was in his daring and boldness to bring Shakespeare's "Henry V," "Hamlet," "Richard III," "Othello," and "King Lear" to the screen, allowing global audiences who previously found Shakespeare's plays too profound to understand and appreciate the immortal works of the Bard. His extraordinary talent and unique contributions earned Olivier three Academy Awards, making him the first actor to be elevated to the British House of Lords.

Olivier loved his profession as an actor and dedicated his acting art to the audience.

He said, "As an actor, during a performance, you must not only feel and love your character but also feel and love your audience. An actor must do everything possible to immerse the audience in everything you do."

When creating a character, an actor—like other artists—enters an unknown realm.

Olivier believed that at this stage, one must be both confident and extraordinarily humble. "Maintaining balance is extremely difficult. If you go too far in one direction, you become ridiculous; if you lean too much the other way, you become ineffective and achieve nothing."

His profound and philosophical explanation of acting art is the crystallization of his experiences of pain, humiliation, failure, and success.

He never forgot that in the early 1930s, in pursuit of artistic development, he crossed the Atlantic to Hollywood, only to be met with indifference. Full of ambition but unrecognized, he was once prepared to co-star with the famous actress Greta Garbo in "Queen Christina," but during the audition, Garbo thought he was not in character and fired him. He had no choice but to return to the London West End stage, dejected.

This setback hurt Olivier's pride but also fueled his determination to become an outstanding actor.

Six years later, he finally won acclaim and applause in Hollywood.

However, the success of his career did not erase the pain in his personal life. Dark clouds often hung over his head, with three marriages and two failures.

His romance with the famous actress Vivien Leigh seemed to be another tragic love story from Shakespeare's pen.

They began romantically, spent 21 years together, but when she was 45, at the time she needed him most; when she was suffering from manic depression and needed him by her side, he left her.

What caused this couple, who loved each other deeply, to part ways?

The world may never know, for neither of them revealed the reason.

However, Olivier conducted a deep self-analysis:

"I am always too romantic, enduring, thorough, and incurable. I am too passionate about pursuing love, so I am tormented by love even more."

Life is a never-ending song, and the path of life is always bumpy.

What pained Olivier the most was also the torment of illness.

Since the 1970s, he was plagued by numerous ailments, but he fought back with the thunderous might of a Shakespearean king.

Yes, no matter how much his spirit and body were battered by storms, he stood firm, pursuing his beloved career—acting—until the age of 81, still performing on stage and creating characters on screen.

For him, life and art are inseparable.

### 生命和事业紧紧相连——世坛奇才奥利弗

    生命和事业紧紧相连
    ——世坛奇才奥利弗
    师秀峰
    当代著名表演艺术家劳伦斯·奥利弗以82岁的高龄在睡梦中平静地离开人世。然而，他的一生不是平静的。
    7月15日，在他逝世后的第4天，我观看了电视传记艺术片《奥利弗的一生》和他80年代初主演的莎士比亚悲剧《李尔王》的录像。他那波澜曲折而又灿烂不凡的一生，他那真挚自然而又深沉逼真的表演，怎能不让人为之赞叹、仰慕。
    《李尔王》这部片子是奥利弗晚年艺术生涯的光辉结晶，被影视界誉为“无与伦比”的成就。
    如同许多艺术家不曾有过幸福的童年一样，奥利弗的童年也不幸福。
    幼年丧母，家境贫寒，在父亲的支持下，他迈进奇妙的戏剧世界。
    10岁登台扮演《凯撒大帝》中的勃鲁托斯，15岁在莎士比亚作品中担任角色。17岁考取伦敦中央戏剧艺术学校，两年后又到伯明翰剧团学艺3年，成为职业演员。
    在此期间，他精读了莎士比亚的全部作品，潜心钻研了莎剧所有重要角色，为其日后的演艺事业奠定了坚实基础。30年代中期，他在著名的伦敦老维克剧团，成功地主演了《罗密欧与朱丽叶》和《王子复仇记》，从而声名雀起，确立了在英国戏剧界不可动摇的地位。
    随后，他赴美国拍摄了电影《呼啸山庄》、《蝴蝶梦》和《傲慢与偏见》，一举扬名天下。
    在追求艺术的征途上，他不停地迈进。
    在50年的悠悠岁月里，他在120多部戏剧、50余部电影和15部电视剧中担任各种角色。
    然而，奥利弗最大的成就不在于他创造了无数迥然各异的人物形象，也不在于炉火纯青的演技给观众留下深刻印象，而在于他以惊人的魄力与胆识，将莎士比亚的《亨利五世》、《哈姆雷特》、《理查三世》、《奥赛罗》和《李尔王》5部名著，成功地搬上了银幕，使从前认为莎剧高深莫测、不敢问津的全球观众，在银幕上得以理解和欣赏了莎翁的不朽名篇。超凡的才华及特殊的贡献使奥利弗三次荣膺奥斯卡金像奖，成为英国历史上第一位上议院的演员。
    奥利弗热爱自己的演员职业，把自己的表演艺术献给观众。
    他说：“作为一名演员，在演出过程中不仅要感受和热爱你的角色，还必须感受和热爱你的观众。演员就是要想尽一切办法，使观众沉湎于你所做的一切之中。”
    在创造一个角色时，演员——同其他艺术家一样——踏进了一个未知的天地。
    奥利弗认为，在这个阶段，必须既要信心百倍，又要谦卑异常。“要做到保持平衡是极其困难的。如果你在这一头走得太远，就显得滑稽可笑；如果你偏向另一端，则将无所作为，一事无成。”
    对表演艺术精湛而富哲理的解释，是他历经痛苦、屈辱、失败、成功的结晶。
    他从未忘记：30年代初为追求艺术上的发展，他横渡大西洋到美国影城好莱坞所遭到的冷遇。踌躇满志，却不被赏识的他，曾准备与大明星葛丽泰·嘉宝联袂主演《瑞典女王》，可是试拍时，嘉宝认为他根本不入戏，而遭解雇。他最后只好败兴回到伦敦西区舞台。
    此次打击伤害了奥利弗的自尊，但激发了他立志做一名出色的演员。
    6个寒暑过去后，他终于在好莱坞赢来鲜花朵朵，掌声片片。
    事业的成功，并未荡涤他个人生活的痛苦。他头上时时阴霾笼罩，三次婚姻，两次失败。
    他与著名影星费雯丽的罗曼史仿佛成了莎翁笔下的又一幕爱情悲剧。
    他们以浪漫的方式开始，经过21个春秋的共同生活，当她45岁，一生中最需要他支持的时候；当她为狂郁精神病所苦，需要他陪伴在侧的时候，他却离开了她。
    是何种原因使这对爱得死去活来的情侣分手了呢？
    世人将无法清楚，因为他们谁也没有透露。
    不过，奥利弗对自己作了深刻的剖析：
    “我总是过于浪漫，经久不衰，彻头彻尾，不可救药。我太热衷于追求爱情，所以被爱情折磨得格外痛苦。”
    生活是一曲唱不完的歌，而生活的道路总会有坎坷。
    最令奥利弗痛苦的还有病魔的折磨。
    自70年代起，他百病缠身，但他都以莎剧君王的雷霆之势愤怒还击。
    是的，无论是精神和肉体受到何种风雨的侵袭，均未使他倒下。他顽强地挺立着，执著地追求固有的事业——演戏，直至81岁高龄仍在舞台上演出，在银幕上创造形象。
    对于他，生命和艺术紧紧相连。
