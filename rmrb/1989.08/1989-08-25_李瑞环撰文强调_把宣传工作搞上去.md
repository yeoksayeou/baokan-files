The ninth issue of the magazine *Thought and Political Work Research*, soon to be published, features an article by Li Ruihuan, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, titled *The Urgent Tasks of Propaganda and Ideological Work at Present*.

The article is divided into four parts. In the first part, Li Ruihuan emphasizes the need to seize the current favorable opportunity to strengthen propaganda work. He states that over the years, Zhao Ziyang's approach has been akin to that of bourgeois liberalization, severely weakening the party's work. The party's propaganda work is in crisis, with many places seeing dispersed teams, lost battlefields, and chaotic thoughts. After the suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the propaganda and ideological fronts face a complex situation, arduous tasks, and serious difficulties. The party's propaganda work must recognize, from the perspective of whether socialism or capitalism will prevail internationally, the historical responsibility it bears to both uphold reform and opening up and to resist infiltration and transformation.

In the second part, the article proposes several concrete measures to strengthen ideological and political work. It states that currently, it is necessary to deeply carry out education on the two fundamental points of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up. There is a question of improving ideological and political work, but the primary issue is whether it is necessary. To reverse the weak state of ideological and political work, it is now necessary to grasp it firmly, concretely, and with practical measures.

In the third part, Li Ruihuan stresses the importance of organizing the study of Marxist theory. He points out that those advocating bourgeois liberalization attack Marxism theoretically, spreading the notion that Marxism is "outdated," with the goal of denying Marxism's guiding role and shaking our theoretical foundation. Currently, a major political task facing the entire party is to strengthen the study, propaganda, and research of Marxist theory, clear up theoretical confusion, and unify and elevate people's ideological understanding.

In the final part, Li Ruihuan points out the need to strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the propaganda team. Currently, efforts must be made to rectify the ideology and organization of the propaganda team, and to strengthen and adjust the leadership teams of some departments and units in the ideological realm. At all levels, propaganda departments should discover talents and expand their teams through practical struggles.

    李瑞环撰文强调
    把宣传工作搞上去
    本报北京八月二十五日讯  即将出版的第九期《思想政治工作研究》杂志，刊登了中央政治局常委李瑞环的文章《当前宣传思想工作的紧迫任务》。
    这篇文章共分四个部分。李瑞环在第一部分提出，抓住当前有利时机把宣传工作搞上去。他说，这些年，赵紫阳同志实际上是以资产阶级自由化的态度对待我们党，致使党的整个工作被严重削弱了。党的宣传工作出现了危机，许多地方队伍散了，阵地丢了，思想乱了。平息动乱和反革命暴乱后，宣传、思想战线面临着复杂的局面、艰巨的任务、严重的困难。党的宣传工作要从国际上社会主义与资本主义谁胜谁负的高度，认识自己所担负的既要坚持改革开放，又要反渗透、反演变的历史责任。
    文章的第二部分提出，办好几件加强思想政治工作的实事。文章说，当前，要深入进行坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放两个基本点的教育。思想政治工作有一个改进的问题，但第一位的是要不要的问题。为了扭转思想政治工作的薄弱状况，现在必须抓紧抓实，抓实事，办实事。
    在文章第三部分，李瑞环强调要组织好马克思主义的理论学习。他指出，搞资产阶级自由化的人，从理论上集中攻击马克思主义，散布马克思主义的“过时论”，其目的就是要否定马克思主义的指导地位，动摇我们的理论基础。当前，摆在全党面前的一个重大政治任务，就是加强马克思主义理论的学习、宣传和研究，廓清理论上的迷雾，统一和提高人们的思想认识。
    在文章最后部分，李瑞环指出，要加强宣传队伍的思想和组织建设。当前首先要下力量做好宣传队伍的思想整顿和组织整顿工作，同时要加强和调整意识形态领域的一些部门和单位的领导班子。各级宣传部门要在斗争实践中发现人才、壮大队伍。
