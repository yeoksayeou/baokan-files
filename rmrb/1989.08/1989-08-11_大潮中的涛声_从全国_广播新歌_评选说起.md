The sound of singing is a unique marker of national spirit and folk customs; the sound of singing is a good way to express emotions and aspirations; the sound of singing is the melody of an era; the sound of singing is an invisible banner.

Songs are everywhere on the earth. The quality of songs is not just a small matter of individuals humming and singing to express their feelings, but a big deal related to the spiritual civilization construction of the country.

The annual "Broadcast New Songs" competition organized by the Central People's Broadcasting Station this year saw 46 radio stations participating, submitting 350 entries. After a final evaluation by a panel of experts, 30 songs were selected as winners.

From the songs in this competition, the themes are quite broad. There are songs praising the motherland such as "The Voice of China," "October, Your Birthday," and "Forty Years of China," as well as songs that sing of local customs and folkways like "The Path of Mulberry Picking" and "The Village in the Magpie's Nest." There are songs that shine with regional characteristics such as "Love for the Yellow Earth," "Northeast, My Black Land," and "My Love, the Great Plains," as well as colorful and diverse ethnic songs like the Tibetan "Love on Mount Everest," the Miao "The Miao Mountains Smile," the Hui "Everywhere in the Motherland is Home to the Hui," and the Jing "Jing Family Girl." There are songs reflecting military life like "Spring on the Mountain, Autumn Down the Mountain," as well as love songs like "The Love of the Tugboat Worker," "Autumn Harvest," and "Ayi Mei." The subjects of these songs are multi-layered and multi-faceted. There are songs about the older generation like "The Sunset Carrying Stars," and songs about youth like "I Am Eighteen," "Sixteen-Year-Old Red Candle," and "The Little Girl from the Foot of the Great Wall." These songs come in various forms and styles. There are heart-stirring songs like "Drum Dance of Bashan," and inspiring songs like "Give Me the Rope." There are also sweet and tender songs like "Song-like Salimang," and "Dreams of Men and Women." There are powerful choral songs like "Mountains Embracing the Sea," and fresh, cheerful, witty, and humorous children's choral songs like "Mountain Children." Particularly, "Mountain Children" topped the list and was widely praised. It vividly describes the excellent qualities of the new generation of "mountain children" who love labor and life, and vividly depicts the happiness and beauty of contemporary children. It is rich in life's breath; the melody is beautiful and romantic. This song competition can be said to have gathered the best of the year's broadcast new songs, praising excellent songs that have both national characteristics and the spirit of the times.

In the previous period, there was an issue of media guidance. Is there a guidance issue in music? This also requires us to calmly consider the past and the future.

Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, song creation has broken free from years of constraints, producing a batch of excellent songs loved by the masses. However, some songs have become increasingly distant from life, reality, and the times, detached from the people, and not grounded in reality. Song creation should have the main melody of the times. It should oppose both "fake, grand, empty" and "high, sharp, hard," as well as "crazy, wild, chaotic" and "fake, evil, ugly." Song creation should enthusiastically sing the praises of the times, express patriotism, foster a spirit of vigor, and spread the voice of Yan and Zhao. Only then will it have vitality. However, we must also guard against another tendency, which is to go back to the past and return to the closed era of single-minded artistic creation. We should boldly innovate in national culture and create more excellent song works for the times and the people.

    大潮中的涛声
    ——从全国“广播新歌”评选说起
    石祥
    歌声，是国风民气的一种特殊标志；歌声，是抒情言志的一种良好形式；歌声，是一曲时代的旋律；歌声，是一面无形的旗帜。
    大地无处不飞歌。歌曲的优劣，不只是个人哼哼唱唱抒发情感的小事，而是关系到国家精神文明建设的大事。
    中央人民广播电台主办的一年一度的“广播新歌”评选，今年共有46家广播电台参加，选送了350首应征歌曲，经各方专家组成评委会进行终评，最后评出30首歌曲获奖。
    从这次评选的歌曲来看，题材相当广泛。既有歌唱祖国的《中华之声》、《十月，你的生日》、《中国四十年》，也有吟咏乡土民情的《采桑小路》、《喜鹊窝里的小山村》；既有闪耀地区特色的歌曲《黄土恋》、《东北，我的黑土地》、《我的爱恋，大平原》，也有绚丽多采的民族歌曲，如藏族的《爱的珠穆朗玛》、苗族的《苗山笑了》、回族的《祖国处处有回回的家》、京族的《京家女》；既有反映部队生活的《春上山，秋下山》，也有爱情歌曲《纤夫的爱》、《摸秋》、《阿依妹》。在反映的对象上也是多层次、多侧面的。有歌唱老一辈的《夕阳背着星星》，也有《我正十八岁》、《十六岁的红蜡烛》、《长城脚下的小妞妞》等。这些歌曲形式多种多样，风格多采多姿。不仅有撼人肺腑的《巴山鼓舞》、催人奋进的《请给我纤绳》，还有甜蜜柔美的《歌一样的撒丽曼》、《男儿梦、女儿梦》；不仅有气势磅礴的合唱《大海拥抱的高山》，还有清新、欢快、风趣、幽默的童声合唱《山童》。尤其是《山童》，名列榜首，受到普遍赞扬。它绘声绘色地描述了新一代“山童”热爱劳动、热爱生活的优良品质，生动活泼地表现了当代儿童青春的幸福和美好，富有生活气息；曲调优美动听，充满浪漫色彩。这次歌曲评选，可以说荟萃了一年来广播新歌的上乘之作，褒扬了具有民族特色又有时代气息的优秀歌曲。
    前一个阶段，舆论有个导向问题。音乐有没有一个导向问题？这也需要我们很冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，歌曲创作冲破了多年的禁锢，出现了一批广为群众喜爱的优秀歌曲。但也有的歌曲离生活越来越远，离现实越来越远，离时代越来越远，不食人间烟火，脱离人民群众。歌曲创作应该具有时代的主旋律。应该既反对“假、大、空”和“高、尖、硬”，也要反对“疯、狂、乱”和“假、恶、丑”。歌曲创作只有热情讴歌时代，抒爱国之情，壮阳刚之气，播燕赵之声，才有生命力。然而目前还要防止另一种倾向，就是走回头路，重新回到文艺创作单一化的封闭时代。应该大胆创民族文化之新，为时代为群众多创作上乘的歌曲作品。
