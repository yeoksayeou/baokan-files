Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 12th.

Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with U.S. Senator Warren Rudman this afternoon. Wan Li said that further developing relations between China and the United States is beneficial for the peoples of both countries and also for world peace and stability.

Wan Li expressed the hope that Sino-American relations could be further developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Wan Li briefed the American guests on the development of the recent turmoil in Beijing, from the student movements to the counter-revolutionary riot. He said, "The U.S. Congress, based on some rumors, passed a resolution to impose sanctions on China, rudely interfering in China's internal affairs. We cannot but respond strongly."

Rudman shared his views on Sino-American relations with Wan Li. He said that Sino-American relations are important for China and also important for the United States. He hoped that the traditional relations between the two countries could be further strengthened.

Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Cai Zemin, attended the meeting. Rudman arrived in Beijing yesterday at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
