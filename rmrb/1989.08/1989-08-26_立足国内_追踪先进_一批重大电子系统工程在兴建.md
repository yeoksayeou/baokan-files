People's Daily, Beijing, August 26th. Reporter Pí Shùyì reports: China's electronics industry is currently focusing on domestic development, constructing a batch of national-level major electronic system projects. Some of these projects have made breakthrough progress.

These projects include the development and production of new models of domestically produced color TVs, VCRs, and digital TVs, as well as the construction of the national banking satellite communications network, color display tube base, and aviation control systems, among others.

According to the China Electronics Information Industry Group (CEI Group), which is responsible for these projects, significant progress has been made in the development of two domestically produced color TV models. This year, 2,000 units will be produced for trial. For new products such as high-definition TVs and digital TVs that are emerging globally, Chinese researchers are also tracking these developments and have formed a digital TV club to collaborate and tackle key issues.

The establishment of the national banking satellite communications network can effectively strengthen financial regulatory functions and accelerate the turnover of 10 billion yuan in transit funds. CEI Group has taken on the overall design, equipment procurement and manufacturing, installation and debugging, and personnel training for this project, adhering to the principle of domestication and making full use of domestic resources. By the end of the year, the main station and 200 sub-stations will be connected and put into operation. The aviation traffic control system project undertaken by the group's Ruida System Equipment Company has already delivered the first system to Jinan Airport for trial use, with good results.

    立足国内　追踪先进
    一批重大电子系统工程在兴建
    本报北京8月26日讯　记者皮树义报道：我国电子行业正立足国内，兴建一批国家级重大电子系统工程，其中一些项目已取得突破性进展。
    这些项目包括：国产彩电新机型、录像机、数字电视的研制与生产，全国银行卫星通信网、彩色显像管基地和航空管制系统的建设等等。
    据承担上述项目的中国电子信息产业集团公司介绍，目前我国在开发TA两片国产化彩电新机型方面，已获重大进展，今年将试产2000台。对世界上初露头角的高清晰度电视、数字电视等新产品，我国科研人员也正在追踪，组成了数字电视俱乐部，协作攻关。
    建立全国银行卫星通讯网，可以有效地强化金融调控功能，加速1000亿元在途资金的周转。中电集团对这项工程的总体设计、设备采购制造、安装调试、人员培训实行了总承包，坚持以国产化为主，充分利用国内资源，到年底将建成主站和200个小站并联网开通。该集团所属的瑞达系统装备公司承包的全国空中交通管制系统工程，一号系统已交付济南机场试用，效果良好。
