A Step Ahead

— Report on the Current Status of Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Co., Ltd.

Reporter: Lin Gang

Domestic First, Asian First-Class

Every time I visit "Volkswagen," there are changes. This time, I was even more impressed.

At Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Company, the most striking feature is the engine assembly workshop. The windows are bright, the floor is clean, and there is not a speck of dust, making one almost doubt whether one has entered a high-tech laboratory. Workers, after rigorous training, operate electric multi-head drills skillfully and lightly. Each screw is tightened under computer control, with the screen displaying the work status at any time to ensure quality. Due to high automation, the entire workshop has only about 20 workers. We were informed that the engines produced here will be exported to the Federal Republic of Germany. This will be the first time that a message is sent to the world: Chinese-made car engines have reached advanced international standards.

The paint shop, converted from an old factory, is undergoing trial runs. This is a fully enclosed, pollution-free automated workshop. We visited the pre-treatment, cathodic electrocoating, dust-free painting, wax spraying, anti-corrosion body sealing, energy-saving drying room, and ground conveyor line sections in sequence. According to the introduction, the key equipment in this workshop is imported from abroad, while the supporting equipment is domestically produced. Its comprehensive level has reached the international first-class standard. The paint shop director, Heinz Krambehl, introduced to the visitors: "Next year, the paint will be domesticated, and the surface paint quality of Shanghai Santana will definitely surpass Europe."

I remember that four years ago, during my first visit to Anting, I was surprised to see that the beautiful cars were assembled on a simple production line by manual operation. Now, what is presented to me is a magnificent modern assembly workshop. In the huge factory, the suspended conveyor belt is winding, and the red, white, and dark green car bodies are slowly moving forward. The 587-meter-long total assembly line controlled by electronic computers has 66 workstations and can simultaneously assemble 90 cars. Along the line, there are various modern lifting devices, liquid filling equipment, and various quality assurance testing instruments. I whispered: Why are there no robots? The escort replied: Robots are too expensive, and the current production volume is still very low, making it uneconomical.

It is truly a transformation from decay to brilliance. In just four years of operation, an old, dilapidated factory is becoming a modern car factory with 1980s standards. In terms of technological progress, it has leaped forward by 30 years. Experts believe that, at present, this is a "domestic first, Asian first-class" level. This fact illustrates that using the method of Sino-foreign joint ventures to carry out technological transformation of old enterprises is a shortcut. The open policy cannot be shaken.

Domesticization Begins Strategic Offensive

Developed countries manufacture cars with a strong and technologically advanced parts industry as a support. Our car industry started too late and can only first introduce a basic model and then organize forces to try every means to replicate it.

The first introduced car model is the Santana. In the past 30 years, we produced very few cars, so the car parts industry was almost non-existent. With no other choice, we had to start with imported parts assembly and then gradually establish our own car parts industry during the domesticization process.

Now, in the automotive industry, there is a consensus: "The domesticization of Santana is of high quality." In four years of struggle, there have been many hardships. Each factory has a history of hardship: trial production, failure; retrial production, failure again, until reaching international standards. Clearing the way, breaking through, overcoming difficulties, and achieving success. By the end of June this year, a cumulative total of 632 parts have been successfully trial-produced, and the acceptance rate of tooling samples has reached 34.6%. "Domesticization is now entering the strategic offensive stage," General Manager Wang Rongjin introduced: "This year, we will lay the foundation for the domesticization of the five major key assemblies: engine, transmission, body, front axle, and rear axle."

Deputy Director Zhao Yunpeng of the Shanghai Santana Domesticization Coordination Office said: "The domesticization work of Santana cars has passed its incubation period, overcome the passive situation that once appeared, and is now on a stable and balanced development path."

Sincere Cooperation

German experts can be seen in every workshop. They are focused in their work, efficient, and even walk quickly. A young technician told me in English: "The foreigners" all adhere to this principle: work hard when working, and play hard when playing. I have also encountered Germans in automobile parts factories in other provinces. Upon inquiry, they are "free technical consultants," a batch of retired automobile experts organized by the German government at the request of the Chinese government.

The success of a joint venture largely depends on whether the cooperation between the Chinese and foreign parties is harmonious. Shanghai Volkswagen has submitted a satisfactory answer sheet. Technical Director Paul has introduced experiences to countries such as the Netherlands and Singapore. Of course, due to cultural differences and different values, there are also conflicts and frictions in cooperation. But conflicts are handled well and promptly. Germans insist on not compromising on quality issues. Among the vast number of workers, the idea of strictly following the standards of Volkswagen in the Federal Republic of Germany has long been deeply rooted and has become a conscious action. Including the German executive director, 17 experts form a "promoter" group, often going deep into various supporting factories to inspect and supervise quality, and help solve technical problems. At the beginning, Chinese workers found it difficult to adapt to the strict requirements of Germans. It is said that some workers would rather not earn high wages than "endure this hardship." The escort pointed to the bustling workshop and said: "Look at how hard and energetic our workers are working!" The labor intensity of Shanghai Volkswagen is far greater than that of ordinary state-owned enterprises.

The Beijing turmoil caused Shanghai traffic to be blocked for a while. In 15 key departments, German experts and Chinese workers together guarded their posts. Many people took detours to come to work. Deputy General Manager Dr. Weigand accepted an interview with the reporter and said: "We did not leave. We will not leave in the future. We will strengthen long-term cooperation with Chinese friends and contribute to the development of China's automobile industry." Mayor Zhu Rongji visited the factory to express his gratitude and praised: "This is sincere cooperation."

General Manager Wang Rongjin is an old comrade who has grown and developed with China's automobile industry. He participated in the establishment of the First Automobile Works and also made contributions to the development of the Second Automobile Works. Three years ago, he was transferred to Volkswagen. Highly advanced car production technology is also unfamiliar to him. According to his observations and analysis, in the field of automobiles, our technology is 20-30 years behind. Ignoring various pressures from all sides, he has always advocated that the industrial front should also "learn from foreigners" and advocated "learning skills from foreigners honestly."

A short visit did not allow me to conduct an in-depth investigation. My notebook recorded the following facts: In the past three years, Shanghai Volkswagen has twice been listed on the "Top Ten Joint Ventures"; in November last year, a team of experts from Volkswagen in the Federal Republic of Germany came to the factory for inspection. The investigation report showed that among the five countries currently producing Santana series products in the world (the other four countries are Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Nigeria), Shanghai has caught up and ranked first in the total quality score. It can be said that Shanghai Santana is the crystallization of the successful cooperation between China and Germany.

Dare to Be the First in the World

Changchun, Wuhan, Shanghai. Our car industry is forming a tripod. The 30,000-car leading project of the First Automobile Works has just started construction, and the Second Automobile Works is still in negotiations with its partners. Currently, Shanghai Volkswagen is in a leading position, not only in quantity but also in product quality, production management, after-sales maintenance services, and other aspects.

The first-phase project, with an investment of 1 billion yuan from both China and Germany, will be completed on schedule. Shanghai Volkswagen will soon form an annual production capacity of 60,000 cars and 100,000 engines. The domesticization rate will reach 85%, and the production cost will be much lower than now. Santana cars will first occupy the domestic market.

One step ahead, step by step ahead. However, can Shanghai maintain this momentum? On the track, the person who initially runs in the first place does not necessarily maintain it to the finish line. Moreover, the other two competitors, the First Automobile Works and the Second Automobile Works, are so powerful and have such strong momentum. But during the days of my visit to Shanghai, I deeply felt that from the mayor to the workers, from the main factory to the parts factory and research institutions, everyone has a spirit of "breaking away from backwardness and striving for strength."

The sense of mission is the external pressure that produces this precious spirit. The state has taken measures to block the import of cars, but it cannot suppress the objectively existing social demand. Economic activities and social exchanges are accelerating, and people yearn for modern transportation tools. Shanghai automobile workers believe: Shanghai, which has produced the most cars since the founding of the country, has the responsibility to provide more and better cars for the motherland.

The sense of responsibility is the internal driving force. The comrades in Shanghai said: Through many years of cooperation with Volkswagen in the Federal Republic of Germany, Shanghai has first possessed the conditions to build a modern car base in terms of technology and management. A car parts supporting network has been formed around Santana's domesticization.

When Jiang Zemin was the mayor of Shanghai, he announced: The car industry is Shanghai's leading pillar industry. After Mayor Zhu Rongji took office, he repeatedly emphasized that the revitalization of Shanghai mainly relies on the development of the car industry. A car industry technology development research center with world-class standards will be established in Shanghai, and a car industry college will be set up. The car industry needs to have momentum and needs to develop on a large scale. The decisive factor is to have its own technological development capabilities.

The world is divided into three parts, and there must be competition. A colleague in the industry analyzes: One-on-one competition among enterprises, Shanghai Volkswagen is not a match for the First Automobile Works and the Second Automobile Works. However, relying on the comprehensive advantages of Shanghai, the largest city in the country as a backing, they dare to be the first in the world.

    领先一步
　　——上海大众汽车有限公司近况报道
    本报记者　林钢
    国内第一　亚洲一流
    每次去“大众”，必有变化。这回更觉耳目一新。
    在上海大众汽车公司，最吸引人的是发动机装配车间，窗明地净，一尘不染，简直怀疑自己是走进了高科技实验室。经过严格培训的工人熟练而轻巧地操作着电器多头风钻，紧拧每一枚螺丝都由电脑控制，屏幕上随时显示工作状况，以保证质量。由于高度自动化，全车间仅20余名工作人员。我们被告知，这里生产的发动机将出口联邦德国。这将是第一次向世界发出信息：中国制造的轿车发动机，达到了国际先进水平。
    由老厂房改建的油漆车间正在试车。这是一个全封闭、无公害的自动化车间。我们顺序参观了预处理、阴极电泳、无尘喷漆、喷蜡、防腐蚀车身密封、节能烘房、地面运输线各工段。据介绍，这个车间的关键设备由国外引进，配套设备却是国产制造，它的综合水平达到国际一流水平。油漆车间主任海因茨·克拉姆贝尔向参观者介绍：“明年油漆实现国产化，上海桑塔纳的面漆质量肯定可以超过欧洲。”
    记得四年前第一次访问安亭，看到漂亮的轿车竟是在一条简陋的生产线上，靠手工操作装配出来的，着实吃了一惊。如今呈现在我面前的，则是一个气象万千的现代化总装车间。在巨大的厂房里，盘旋悬挂式输送链上，一辆辆红色的、白色的、墨绿色的轿车车身在缓缓向前移动。电子计算机控制的全长587米的总装线，有66个工位，同时可以装配90辆轿车。沿线备有各种现代化的举升装置，加液设备，以及保证质量的各种检测仪器。我悄声问：何以不见机器人。陪同答：机器人太昂贵，目前产量还很低，不合算。
    真乃化腐朽为神奇。开业仅仅4年，一家破旧的老厂，正在变成具有80年代水平的现代化轿车厂。就技术进步而言，整整跨越了30年。行家认为，就目前而言，这是“国内第一，亚洲一流”的水平。这说明一个事实：用中外合资的方式对老企业进行技术改造，是条捷径。开放政策不能动摇。
    国产化开始战略攻坚
    发达国家制造轿车，有强大而技术先进的零部件工业作为依托。我国轿车工业起步太晚了，只能先引进一个基本车型，然后组织力量千方百计地把它照样造出来。
    第一个引进的轿车车型，就是桑塔纳。过去卅年我们很少生产轿车，所以轿车的零部件工业几乎等于零。别无选择，只能从进口散件组装开始，然后在国产化过程中逐步建立起自己的轿车零部件工业。
    如今在汽车行业，已有定评：“桑塔纳的国产化是高质量的。”四年拚搏，甘苦备尝。每家工厂都有一段苦难的历程：试制，失败；再试制，再失败，终于达到国际标准。披荆斩棘，闯关夺隘，历尽艰险。到今年6月底，累计已有632项零部件试制成功，工装样品认可率达到34.6％。“国产化目前已进入战略攻坚的阶段。”总经理王荣钧介绍说：“今年，我们要为实现发动机、变速箱、车身、前桥和后桥这五大关键总成的国产化打好基础。
    上海市桑塔纳国产化协调办公室副主任赵云鹏说：“桑塔纳轿车的国产化工作，度过了它的孕育期，摆脱了一度出现的被动局面，现在已经走上稳定、均衡发展的道路。”
    真诚的合作
    每个车间都可见到德国专家。他们在工作中神情专注，讲求效率，连走路也来去匆匆。一青年技术员用英语对我说：“老外”都奉行这样的信条：工作时认真工作，玩儿时尽情地玩。我在外省的零部件工厂，也多次遇见德国人。经询问，他们是“免费技术顾问”，是应我国政府之请，联邦德国大众组织来华的一批退休汽车专家。
    合资企业的成败，很大程度上决定于中外双方合作得是否和谐。上海大众交了一份令人满意的答卷。执行技术经理保尔曾到荷兰、新加坡等国家介绍经验。当然，毕竟文化不同，价值观念不同，合作中也有矛盾，有摩擦。但矛盾处理得很好，很及时。德国人始终如一地坚持：在质量问题上，决不让步。而在广大职工中，严格按照联邦德国大众标准的思想也早已深入人心，化为自觉行动。包括德方执行经理在内的17名专家，组成“促进者”小组，经常深入各配套厂家检查监督质量，帮助解决技术难题。对于德国人的严格要求，开始中国工人难以适应。据说，有的工人宁可不挣高工资，“也不愿受这份累”。陪同者指着沸腾的车间说：“你看看我们的工人干得多辛苦，多卖劲！”上海大众的劳动强度，远远超过一般的国营企业。
    北京动乱，上海交通也一度阻塞。在15个关键部门的德国专家和中国职工一起坚守岗位。许多人绕道赶来上班。德方副总经理魏格纳博士接受记者采访时说：“我们没有走。以后也不会走。我们还要加强和中国朋友的长期合作，致力于中国轿车工业的发展。”朱熔基市长到厂里慰问，称赞说：“这是真诚的合作”。
    总经理王荣钧是随中国汽车工业一起成长发展的老同志，他参加了一汽的创建，也为二汽的发展作出过贡献。三年前调来大众。高度先进技术的轿车生产对他也是陌生的。据他的观察与分析，在汽车领域，我们的技术落后了20—30年。不理会来自各方的压力，顶住各种闲言碎语，他始终主张工业战线也要“洋为中用”，主张“老老实实地向外国人学本领。”
    短暂的访问不允许我作深入考察。我的采访本上记录了下列事实：三年里上海大众两次荣登“十佳合资企业”的金榜；去年11月，联邦德国大众派专家组来厂检查，调查报告表明，在目前世界上生产桑塔纳系列产品的五个国家中（其他四个国家是墨西哥、巴西、阿根廷、尼日利亚），上海后来居上，质量总分名列第一。可以这样说，上海桑塔纳是中德双方成功合作的结晶。
    敢为天下先
    长春——武汉——上海。我国轿车工业正在形成鼎足之势。一汽的3万辆轿车先导工程刚刚动工兴建，二汽尚在与合作伙伴谈判。目前，上海大众处在领先一步的地位。不仅在数量，而且在产品质量、生产管理、售后维修服务等方面。
    第一期工程，中德双方投资10亿元，就要如期完工。上海大众即将形成年产轿车6万辆，发动机10万台的能力。国产化率将达到85％，生产成本比现在低得多，桑塔纳轿车将先期占领国内市场。
    一步主动，步步主动。然而上海能保持住这个势头吗？田径场上，最初跑在第一的人，未必都能保持到终点。何况另外两个对手——一汽和二汽两大企业集团，实力如此雄厚，后劲如此强大。但在上海采访的日子里，我深切感受到，从市长到工人，从主机厂到配件厂、科研机构，上上下下都有一股“摆脱落后、奋发图强”的精神。
    使命感是产生这种可贵精神的外部压力。国家采取措施挡住了轿车进口，但是无法抑止客观存在的社会需求。经济活动和社会交往日益加快节奏，人民渴望现代化的交通工具。上海汽车工人认为：建国以来生产轿车最多的上海，有责任为祖国提供更多更好的轿车。
    责任感是其内在动力。上海的同志们说：通过和联邦德国大众多年合作，上海在技术上和经营管理上已经首先具备了建成现代化轿车基地的条件。围绕桑塔纳国产化，又已形成了轿车零部件配套网络。
    江泽民总书记在担任上海市长时就宣布：轿车工业是上海居首位的支柱产业。朱熔基市长到任后，多次强调，振兴上海，主要依靠发展轿车工业。要在上海筹建具有世界水平的汽车工业技术开发研究中心，筹办汽车工业学院。轿车工业要有后劲，要大发展，决定性的因素是要有自己的技术开发能力。
    天下三分，必有竞争。同行中的一位行家这样分析：企业之间一对一的较量，上海大众不是一汽和二汽的对手。然而，凭借上海这样全国第一大城市的综合优势作后盾，他们敢为天下先。
