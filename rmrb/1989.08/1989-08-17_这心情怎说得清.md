This Heart, How Can It Be Explained?

Huamingyue

Many times I imagined how joyful it would be to cross the threshold of the college entrance examination, but I never expected that as soon as I received my admission notice, the dream-like days of high school would suddenly dissipate. Although I knew that one day life would settle down and no longer indulge in boundless fantasies and speculations, I was unwilling to accept that this day would come so soon, so abruptly, and so suddenly that a strong resistance began to grow in my subconscious.

Just out of three years of fierce competition, freshmen are inevitably skeptical about friendship. Roommates are polite but distant, and it is difficult to discuss matters with those nearby, so one can only ponder and think deeply. Unable to sleep, some walk down to the courtyard for a stroll, some quietly turn on the lamp to read old newspapers, and some wash clothes in the bathroom late at night, washing away troubles along with the soap on the collar. The sound of water splashing nearby also echoes, and a familiar face turns around, only then realizing that insomnia is not just one person's problem...

Sigh, no one is used to parents and teachers letting go, but they have indeed completely let go and relaxed: having crossed the threshold of the college entrance examination, what more obstacles lie ahead?

But the path behind the college entrance examination is not a smooth road. The university's tree-lined path is too wide and too long, with a canopy of green trees forming a "dome," walking in this green cave feels a sense of pressure: the glory of being the center of attention in high school has vanished, who would have thought that beneath the leisurely appearance of university life lies an even more intense competition? Especially after 18 years of being supported in every way, suddenly losing all support, this suppression becomes even heavier.

For a long time, the mind is difficult to balance, always feeling that the carefree days of happiness are like colorful butterflies, thrown out and flying in arcs with sunlight, but hating that there is no magician's trick to call them back.

Only after discarding the initial arrogance and seclusion, being able to get along happily with new friends, and calmly accepting an ordinary and real self, deciding to walk steadily forward, did the world become clear and bright again.

At this moment, the young heart, without exception, begins to fill up, but it still lacks the shell of adult wisdom, lightly touched, will flow out either sour or sweet juice.

At the moment of happiness, everyone guarantees that if there is ever a lush and perfect moment, no matter what the future outcome is, they will maintain a heart without regret; once they have to part, no one can casually wave their hand, waving their hand cannot cut off the rain that reaches the sky...

We will regard every success as the inevitable result of our own hard work, and every failure as an unfair accident of fate; when things are going well, people's kindness will definitely be magnified a thousand times in the pupils, and when things are not going well, the bitterness of the world will also spread in the eyes...

At that time and place, how can one explain this feeling?

Only one thing is clear: after this age, time filters out the losses and worries, and past life will become the purest and most beautiful. At the same time, coming out of the dream, step by step approaching reality, there is a sense of social responsibility and the joy of maturity.

    这心情怎说得清
    华明玥
    无数次地设想过，跨过了高考这道门该有多快活，却从没料到拿到录取通知书那一刻起，中学时代花市般的梦境就倏然消散了。虽然早知道总有一天生活会沉淀下来，不再作漫无边际的遐想和猜测，却不甘心这一天来得这么快，这等突然，突然得潜意识里滋生出某种强烈的抗拒。
    刚从三年剧烈的竞争中走出来，大学一年级的新生难免对友情抱一种将信将疑的态度，同寝室的人彬彬有礼却相当疏远，遇事很难跟近在咫尺的人商量，只得自个儿反复掂量，苦思冥想。想得睡不着，有的摸下宿舍楼去操场散步，有的悄悄开了台灯看陈年八代的报纸，有的深更半夜跑到水房洗衣服，将烦恼连同肥皂一起打在衣领上，旁边“哗哗哗”的水声也响了，一张熟悉的脸转了过来，这才发现闹失眠的不仅仅是一个……
    唉，谁都不习惯父母老师撒手不管，可他们确实完全放了心也放了手，精疲力竭地舒了口气：领过高考这道门槛，往后的日子还有什么沟沟坎坎？
    可高考这道山门后并不是柏油马路哩。大学的林荫道太宽太长，绿森森的树冠搭成穹形的“洞顶”，走在这绿色的山洞里受到一股压力：中学时代众星捧月似的荣耀已一去不复返，谁曾想过大学生活悠游自在的外表下孕育着更激烈的竞争呢？尤其在18个年岁处处扶持的日子之后，忽然失去了所有的依傍，这种压抑就愈加沉重。
    心理上很长一段时间难以平衡，总觉得快乐的不知天高地厚的日子像彩色飞蝶，抛出去的时候一个个划着弧线盛着阳光好惬意，却恨无魔术师的特技，能拍拍双手叫它回来。
    直到摈弃了初来时孤傲自闭的心理，能与新朋友愉快地相处，并心平气和地接受了一个平凡真实的自己，决定踏踏实实地走下去之后，方觉风清云淡，世界重新变得安定而明朗。
    此刻，年轻的心，无一例外地开始丰盈起来，但毕竟缺少成人理智的外壳，轻轻一触，就会流出或酸或甜的汁液。
    幸福的当口，谁都保证只要有过葱茏完美的一刻，不论将来结果如何，都会保持无怨无悔的心情；一旦不得不分手，谁都没法潇洒地挥一挥手，挥挥手也不能挥断连天的雨丝啊……
    我们会把每一点成功认作自己百般努力的必然，也会把每一点失败看成命运不公正的偶然；顺利的时候，人们的善意一定在瞳仁里放大千倍，不顺利的时候，世情的辛酸也会在眼底蔓延……
    当时当地，怎么说得清，这种心情？
    只有一点是明确的，过了这个年龄，时间滤尽了失落和烦忧，昔日的生活又会变得最为纯净最为美丽。同时，从梦幻中走出来，一步步贴近现实，便有了社会的责任感和成熟的欣喜。
