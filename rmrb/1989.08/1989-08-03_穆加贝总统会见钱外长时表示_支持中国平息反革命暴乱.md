Mugabe Expresses Support for China's Measures to Quell Counter-Revolutionary Riots

HARARE, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe today expressed support for China's measures to quell counter-revolutionary riots during a meeting with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

Mugabe said that Zimbabwe has consistently supported China's policies and refused to join the current anti-China wave initiated by Western countries. He said that Western countries attempted to establish a government in China to their liking, which made Zimbabwe concerned. Later, China took decisive measures to quell the disturbances, which made Zimbabwe feel relieved and happy.

Mugabe also briefed Qian on the current situation in Southern Africa. He said that while there is a easing atmosphere in the region, with Namibia moving towards independence according to UN Resolution 435 and Angola achieving a ceasefire, and Mozambique showing signs of reconciliation, the white regime in South Africa is still creating obstacles, hindering Namibia's independence process, and maintaining apartheid policies domestically, opposing majority rule through one person, one vote.

Qian said that the purpose of his visit to Southern African countries is to understand the real situation in the region and to express China's sincere support for the just struggle of Southern African countries and peoples against racism.

Qian also briefed Mugabe on the situation regarding the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue. Mugabe said that as the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, he would make further efforts to promote a political solution to the Cambodian issue.

Qian arrived in Harare this morning after participating in the Paris International Conference on the Cambodian issue. Before this, Qian had visited Botswana and Lesotho. He will also visit Angola, Zambia, and Mozambique.

    穆加贝总统会见钱外长时表示
    支持中国平息反革命暴乱
    本报哈拉雷8月3日电  新华社记者张敬雷、本报记者李景卫报道：津巴布韦总统罗伯特·穆加贝今天在这里向来访的中国外交部长钱其琛表示，津巴布韦支持中国采取的平息反革命暴乱的措施。
    穆加贝总统说，津巴布韦支持中国的政策是一贯的，津巴布韦拒绝参加当前西方国家掀起的反华浪潮。他说，西方国家企图按照自己的意志在中国建立一个他们喜欢的政权，这使津巴布韦感到忧虑；后来中国采取果断措施，平息了动乱，使津巴布韦感到放心和高兴。
    穆加贝总统还向钱其琛外长通报了当前南部非洲局势。他说：南部非洲地区一方面出现了缓和气氛，纳米比亚按照联合国435号决议正在走向独立；安哥拉实现了停火；莫桑比克也出现了和解势头。但另一方面，南非白人政权仍然在设置障碍，阻挠纳米比亚独立进程，在国内坚持种族隔离政策，反对通过一人一票实现多数人掌权。
    钱其琛外长说，他这次到南部非洲国家访问的目的是：了解南部非洲局势的真实情况，并表示中国政府和人民对南部非洲国家和人民反对种族主义的正义斗争的真诚支持。
    钱外长还向穆加贝总统通报了关于讨论柬埔寨问题巴黎国际会议的情况。穆加贝表示，以他为主席的不结盟运动将进一步作出努力推动柬埔寨问题的政治解决。
    钱其琛外长是在巴黎参加关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议后于今天上午抵达哈拉雷对津巴布韦进行为期3天的访问的。此前，钱外长已访问了博茨瓦纳和莱索托。他还将访问安哥拉、赞比亚和莫桑比克。
