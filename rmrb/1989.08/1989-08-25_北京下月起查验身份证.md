The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau announced today that Beijing will start checking residents' ID cards beginning September 1. Beijing residents and out-of-town visitors to Beijing must carry their resident ID cards or other valid identification documents with them at all times for inspection.

It is understood that strengthening ID card inspections is aimed at better serving the public, managing the city, and creating a good social environment for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the upcoming 1990 Asian Games. Currently, out of the more than 800 million people nationwide who should have ID cards, over 500 million citizens have already obtained them.

Additionally, Beijing will also strengthen the inspection of motor vehicle driver's licenses.
