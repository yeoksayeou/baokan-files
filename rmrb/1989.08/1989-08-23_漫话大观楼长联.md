Title: Rambling About the Long Couplet of the Great View Pavilion

The origin of couplets is a matter of debate. Some scholars trace it back to the Five Dynasties, when it began with the use of peach wood charms. Later, during the Song Dynasty, people started to use them on the pillars of buildings, and it became popular during the Yuan and Ming dynasties. The majority of traditional Chinese architecture is made of wood and earth. Carving couplets on the numerous pillars and walls is a form of artistic decoration. This is especially true for famous historical sites, where scholars and literati often visit and write couplets on the spot, some of which are indeed masterpieces. The long couplet at the Great View Pavilion in Kunming is one such renowned work. The author is Sun Ran. It is said that he was a stranger who, due to his failure in the imperial examinations, fell into poverty and wandered to Kunming. He often drank tea at the Great View Pavilion, facing the vast expanse of Dian Lake, and wrote this couplet inspired by the scenery. Each half of the couplet consists of 90 characters, totaling 180 characters.

Historically, opinions about this couplet have been mostly positive, but during the Qianlong and Jiaqing reigns, there was a scholar named Yuan Yuan, who served as the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou, who was not satisfied with Sun Ran's couplet and even took it upon himself to revise it. To save space, I will transcribe Sun Ran's original couplet below and attach Yuan Yuan's revised phrases in parentheses for comparison and appreciation of their merits and demerits.

	Upper Couplet: Five hundred li of Dian Lake, rushing into the eye. Opening the robe and hat (leaning on the railing and looking far), delighting in the boundless expanse (waves) without end: seeing the eastern divine steed (golden horse), western spirit rooster (azure rooster), northern winding dragon (leaning on the coiled dragon), southern flying white (tame elephant), high-minded scholars, why not choose a victory and ascend (regret the flowing water and time)! Taking advantage of the crab islets and snail mounds, combing and wrapping the wind hair and mist brows (lining up the blue cliffs and green walls); moreover, the lotus sky and reed earth, adding some green feathers and red clouds (early return of thin mist and dew), do not let down the surrounding fragrant rice, ten thousand acres of clear (seagull) sand, nine summers of lotus, three springs of willows.

	Lower Couplet: Countless years of past events, recorded in the heart. Holding wine in the void, sighing at the rolling heroes who are gone? Thinking of the Han's naval ships, Tang's iron pillars, Song's jade axes, Yuan's leather bags, great achievements and merits (Chuan chief and Meng chief), exhausting the spirit and strength to move mountains! All the pearl curtains and painted beams, cannot roll up the evening rain and morning clouds; even the broken steles and ancient inscriptions (moss-covered steles and mossy inscriptions), all are left to the desolate smoke and setting sun, only gaining a few sparse temple bells, half a river of fishing fires, two rows of autumn (geese), one pillow of clear frost (a piece of desolation)!

With comparison, there is distinction. Sun Ran's original couplet is written in one breath. The upper couplet describes the scenery, using ethereal language to replace concrete objects, the ink's aura truly makes one feel boundless! The lower couplet reflects on the historical changes of thousands of years, lamenting the vicissitudes of life. This is similar to the famous works "Lan Ting Xu" and "Yue Yang Lou Ji," where the author deeply expresses the contradictions between the universe and human life, thereby producing complex emotions.

It comes from a wandering scholar's mouth, which is more likely to arouse people's sympathy and admiration. On the contrary, Yuan Yuan, who held a high position, could not understand the author's feelings. Look at his revised phrases; not only do they not improve the original couplet, but the literary elegance is also not superior, even though he was a scholar of classical studies. I do not intend to comment on all the revised phrases one by one, but will only elaborate on the most important ones.

	Example one: The revised phrases "leaning on the railing and looking far" and "waves without end" in the upper couplet are superfluous. The original clearly states "five hundred li of Dian Lake rushing into the eye," so what is the need for "leaning on the railing and looking far"? Changing "boundless expanse" to "waves" is also inappropriate. The original does not just refer to water but also includes the sky, so "boundless expanse" is used to summarize. Without the sky, the water cannot show its vastness.

	Example two: The actual scenery around Dian Lake indeed has the Golden Horse, Azure Rooster, Snake Mountain, and Crane Mountain. The original uses ethereal brushstrokes to depict these real scenes, making the still objects come to life, with great artistic charm, making people's imagination soar. The revised version is like listing names in a formation, lacking vitality.

	It should also be noted that this Yuan gentleman changed the phrase "great achievements and merits" in the lower couplet to the absurd "Chuan chief and Meng chief." It must be known that the original four characters serve as a warning, summarizing the past glory, first praising positively, and then triggering the following sentence with a negative meaning of "exhausting the spirit and strength to move mountains," opening up endless historical reflections. It is inseparable from the upper and lower sentences. But after Yuan's revision, the following sentence becomes awkward and powerless. Why did Yuan change it? According to the letter he wrote to his disciple Liang Zhangju, he said: Sun Ran only wrote about the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, without mentioning the current dynasty, and should add a note about Wu Sangui and others, otherwise "great achievements and merits are all in vain, how can it be said to be about our dynasty!" Adding this sentence, "so as to support the right and eliminate the wrong."

	According to him, the characters "Chuan" and "Meng" refer to the minority ethnic groups on the border of Yunnan and Guizhou. The former was anciently called the "Meng Meng" tribe, now called the Yi tribe; the latter was anciently called the "Meng" tribe, now called the Bai tribe, mostly residing in the Dali area. Yuan's praise of the Qing dynasty inadvertently aroused the dissatisfaction of the minority ethnic groups. Soon after Yuan's resignation, the revised couplet was removed and the original by Sun Ran was rehung. Yuan knew about this and helplessly said: "Those who have complaints, the Meng chief did not understand!" This shows how this Governor-General's political bias did not respect and understand the feelings of minority ethnic groups.

	Did the long couplet begin with Sun Ran? Are there any others after him?

	As far as I know, during the Republic of China period, there was a long couplet of 226 characters at the Victory Pavilion by Moqu Lake in Nanjing, written by Zhao Daiwen. Besides this, there is a long couplet of 256 characters at the newly renovated Tengwang Pavilion, written by the dramatist Shi Linghe. These two long couplets were both inspired and influenced by Sun Ran.

    漫话大观楼长联
    袁啸
    楹联起于何时，其说不一。有人考证说肇始于五代的桃符。以后用之于楹柱，则是宋人带的头，到了元明才兴旺起来。我国自古以来的建筑结构，绝大多数是土木，在众多的楹柱和墙壁上张刻一些对联，不失为一种艺术的装饰。尤其是名胜古迹，文人墨客到此即兴挥毫，其中确也不乏佳作。昆明大观楼的长联，便是脍炙人口的佳作之一。作者名孙髯。据传是一位异乡人，因科场不得意，穷愁潦倒，流落昆明。他常在大观楼饮茶，面对滇池的浩渺烟波，即景感怀。所撰联各90字，共180字。
    历来舆论对它褒多贬少，但在乾嘉之际，有一位阮元，任云贵总督，却对孙髯此联不甚满意，居然动手修改。现在为了节省篇幅，我把孙氏的长联抄录如下，把阮氏的改句用括弧附于原句之后，以便对照欣赏，优劣自现。
    上联：五百里滇池，奔来眼底。披襟岸帻（凭栏向远），喜茫茫空阔（波浪）无边：看东骧神骏（金马），西翥灵仪（碧鸡），北走蜿蜒（倚盘龙），南翔缟素（驯宝象），高人韵士，何妨选胜登临（惜抛流水光阴）！趁蟹屿螺洲，梳裹就风鬟雾鬓（衬将起苍崖翠壁）；更苹天苇地，点缀些翠羽丹霞（早收回薄雾殊露），莫辜负四围香稻，万顷晴（鸥）沙，九夏芙蓉，三春杨柳。
    下联：数千年往事，注到心头。把酒凌虚，叹滚滚英雄谁在？想汉习楼船，唐标铁柱，宋挥玉斧，元跨革囊，伟烈丰功（爨长蒙酋），费尽移山心（气）力！尽珠帘画栋，卷不及暮雨朝云；便断碣残碑（藓碣苔碑），都付与苍（荒）烟落照，只赢得几杵疏钟，半江渔火，两行秋（鸿）雁，一枕清霜（一片沧桑）！
    有了对比，就有了鉴别。孙髯原作，两联一气呵成。上联写景，以空灵代实体，墨气所射，真觉四表无穷！下联则就千百年来的历史更替，感慨人世间的苍黄反覆。这和《兰亭集序》、《岳阳楼记》两篇名作一样，作者深刻地抒发了宇宙与人生之间的矛盾，由此而产生的复杂的感应。
    它出自于一个落泊异乡的文士之口，更易激起人们的同情与激赏。反之，身居高位的阮元，是不可能理解作者的心情的。试看他的改句，不但无补于原联，文采也未见高明，尽管他还是一位经学家。我不想就全部改句逐一评论，仅就其中最主要的予以阐述。
    例一：上联的改句“凭栏向远”和“波浪无边”，就是画蛇添足。因为原作分明说了“五百里滇池奔来眼底”，还要“凭栏向远”作甚？把“空阔”改作“波浪”，也不妥。原作不单指水，还有天空，所以用“空阔”来概括。无天空的水也显不出水的“茫茫”来。
    例二：滇池四面的实景，确有金马、碧鸡、蛇山和鹤山诸胜。原作对于这些实景全用虚笔烘托，把静物写得栩栩如生，极具艺术的魅力，使人浮想联翩。而改作恰如列阵点名，了无生趣。
    还应该指出的是：这位阮大人竟把下联的“伟烈丰功”四字，荒唐地改作“爨长蒙酋”。须知原作的这四个字所起的警句作用，它既概括了前朝盛事，先作了正面的颂扬，从而反激起下句含有消极意义的“费尽移山心力”，展开了不尽的历史反思。承上启下，完全不可分割。但经阮氏一改，便显得下句转合不畅，苍白无力。阮氏为什么这样改？据他写给门生梁章巨的信中说：孙髯只写了汉唐宋元，未提本朝，应把吴三桂等人补写一笔，否则“伟烈丰功总归一空为主，岂不骎骎乎说到我朝”！补上这一句，“所以扶正而消逆也”。
    按：“爨”、“蒙”二字，都指的是云贵边境的少数民族。前者古称“猡猡”族，今称彝族；后者古称“蒙”族，今称白族，多居大理一带。阮氏对清廷歌功颂德，却不料引起了少数民族的不满。在阮氏卸任不久，改一联即被地方撤去，重新挂上了孙髯的原作。阮氏知道以后，无可奈何地说：“啧有烦言者，蒙酋未达耳！”由此可见这位总督大人的政治偏见，对少数民族的情感是如何不尊重，如何的不理解。
    长联始于孙髯，这以后还有没有呢？
    据我所知，民国时期在南京莫愁湖的胜棋楼，有一副长联共226字，作者名赵戴文。除此而外，还有新中国修缮的滕王阁，有长联共256字，是戏剧家石凌鹤的手笔。这两副长联都受孙髯启发影响。
