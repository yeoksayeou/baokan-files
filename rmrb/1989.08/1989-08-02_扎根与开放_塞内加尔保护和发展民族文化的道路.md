Known as the "Little Paris of West Africa," Dakar is not only picturesque and pleasant, but also a true "city of art." Whether in the bustling city center or the tranquil seaside, exquisite wood carvings, ivory carvings, horn carvings, sand paintings, glass paintings, bronze artifacts, and artistic tapestries can be found everywhere, dazzling the eyes. If you visit "West Africa's Corner," "Art Village," and Goree Island, you will be even more amazed and appreciate the charm of traditional African art. These exquisite artworks are not only witnesses to African black civilization but also symbols of the wisdom and intelligence of the Senegalese people.

The Senegalese government's efforts to protect and develop national culture are evident. Its guiding ideology comes from the "Négritude" philosophy of former President Senghor, which can be summarized as "rooted and open." This means that developing national culture must be rooted in the fertile soil of Africa, cultivating art that suits the country's characteristics; at the same time, it advocates for cultural openness to absorb the essence of foreign cultures, continuously enriching and promoting the development of the country's culture. President Diouf has inherited Senghor's cultural policy, emphasizing that "culture is closely tied to a country's fate," and has incorporated the development of culture into the country's overall development plan. The specific measures are as follows:

The state values cultural undertakings and plays the role of functional departments. The government emphasizes that culture is both the starting point and the destination of all undertakings. Cultural development and socio-economic development are inseparable, with culture enhancing national consciousness and generating immense material power, while economic development creates the necessary conditions for cultural development. The state allocates large sums of money each year to develop cultural and educational undertakings. The Ministry of Culture has departments for literature, historical heritage, and public libraries, and sends cultural advisors to various regions. Cultural facilities are well-equipped, with various art troupes, art academies, museums, research centers, and more.

Implementing a decentralized cultural policy and organizing mass cultural activities. At the beginning of independence, Senegal's cultural facilities were mainly concentrated in a few large cities such as Dakar and Saint-Louis. To change this unreasonable situation, the government proposed a "cultural decentralization" policy, encouraging and supporting local cultural development. The government provides support in terms of finance, materials, and personnel, first establishing "cultural centers" in various regions nationwide; setting up numerous "cultural reading centers" in rural areas; and offering art education courses in primary and secondary schools, providing art education instructors. All cultural and artistic training institutions in Senegal are open to the public, encouraging professional art troupes to perform in local and grassroots areas.

Cultivating a large number of artistic talents and encouraging diverse artistic styles. Previously, Senegal had only one art academy, the "Maison des Arts de la Mer." After independence, it established the "Higher School of Art Education," "National School of Fine Arts," "Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama," "School of Architecture and Urban Planning," and more, cultivating a large number of art talents, and setting up many research centers. The "Senghor Foundation" provides annual support to scientists, cultural workers, and educators, awards literary works, provides scholarships to students studying abroad, organizes art troupes to visit other countries, and holds exhibitions, lectures, and seminars. The state protects the freedom of literary and artistic creation, and under the premise of respecting educational and moral principles, artists can create freely according to their own styles and preferences.

Inheriting national cultural heritage and protecting historical relics and ancient sites. The government attaches great importance to excavating the national art treasury and paying attention to the collection and organization of folk literature. All artifacts, ancient sites, artworks, religious holy places, and natural scenic spots with collection and preservation value are listed as national protected objects, classified, and registered for public announcement. The "Museum of Fundamental Research on Black Africa" at Dakar University alone has over 27,000 collected artifacts and specimens. The former "slave fortress" - Goree Island has been listed as a world-class cultural heritage site by UNESCO, and five museums have been built on this small island.

Actively carrying out cultural exchanges with the outside world to enrich and flourish national culture. The government seizes every possible opportunity to develop cultural cooperation with foreign countries, especially West African countries, through various channels and forms, and continues to develop traditional cultural exchanges with France. In recent years, it has increasingly valued cultural exchanges and cooperation with other developed countries.

To further develop cultural undertakings, promote national economic development, and social progress, the Senegalese government is drafting a "Cultural Charter." People believe that the promulgation and implementation of this charter will make this garden of African arts even more colorful and vibrant.

    扎根与开放
    ——塞内加尔保护和发展民族文化的道路
    本报记者  杨汝生
    素有西非“小巴黎”之称的达喀尔，不仅风光旖旎，气候宜人，它还是一座名副其实的“艺术城”。不论是在繁华的市区，还是静谧的海滨，随处都能欣赏到一件件木雕、牙雕、角雕，还有那些沙土画、玻璃画、青铜制品和艺术挂毯等，让人目不暇接。若是去“西非之角”、“艺术村”和戈雷岛，更是令人大开眼界，领略到非洲传统艺术的风采。这些精美的艺术品既是非洲黑人文明的见证，也是塞内加尔人民聪明智慧的象征。
    塞内加尔政府重视保护和发展民族文化是有目共睹的。它的指导思想来源于前总统桑戈尔的“黑人学”思想，其政策可归纳为“扎根与开放”。也就是说，发展民族文化只能植根于非洲这块固有的沃土，培育适合本国特点的艺术花朵；同时又主张文化对外开放，吸收异邦文化之精华，不断丰富和促进本国文化的发展。迪乌夫总统继承了桑戈尔的文化政策，强调“文化与一个国家的命运休戚相关”，把发展文化纳入国家的整个发展规划之中，其具体做法如下：
    国家重视文化事业，发挥职能部门的作用　政府强调文化既是各项事业发展的起点，也是归宿。文化发展与社会经济的发展是不可分割的整体，文化可以提高民族意识，产生巨大的物质力量，而经济发展又为文化发展创造必要的条件。国家每年都拨出大笔资金用于发展文化和教育事业。文化部设文学司、历史遗产司、公共图书馆司等，并向各大区派文化顾问。文化设施十分齐备，各种各样的文艺团体、艺术院校、博物馆、研究中心等应有尽有。
    实行文化分散政策，开展群众性文化活动　独立之初，塞内加尔的文化设施主要集中在达喀尔、圣路易等几个大城市。为了改变这一不合理现象，政府提出了“文化分散”政策，鼓励和支持地方发展文化事业。政府在财力、物力和人员方面给以支援，首先在全国各大区建立了“文化中心”；在广大农村兴办了许多“文化阅读中心”；在中小学开设艺术教育课，配备了艺术教育辅导员。塞内加尔所有的文化艺术培训机构均向全民开放，鼓励专业文艺团体到地方和基层演出。
    培养大批艺术人才，鼓励作品风格多样　从前，塞内加尔全国只有一所艺术院校，即“马里艺术之家”，独立后不仅创建了“高等艺术师范学校”、“国立美术学校”、“音乐舞蹈、戏剧学院”、“建筑城市规划学校”等，造就了大批文艺人才，还设立了许多研究中心。“桑戈尔基金会”每年还向科学、文化、教育工作者提供资助，颁发文学作品奖，向出国学生发助学金，组织文艺团体出访，以及举办展览会、报告会和研讨会等。国家保护文学艺术创作自由，在尊重教育和道德原则的前提下，艺术家可根据自己的风格和爱好而自由创作。
    继承民族文化遗产，保护历史文物古迹　政府极为重视发掘民族艺术宝库，注意民间文学的搜集和整理。凡有收藏和保存价值的文物、古迹、艺术品、宗教圣地和自然风景区等均列为国家保护对象，并列出等级登记造册，向全民公布。在达喀尔大学的“黑非洲基础研究博物馆”里，仅收藏的文物和标本就有2.7万多件。昔日的“奴隶堡”——戈雷岛已由联合国教科文组织列为世界级文化遗产，在这个小小的岛屿上竟修建了5个博物馆。
    积极开展对外文化交流，丰富繁荣民族文化　政府利用一切可能的机会，通过多种渠道，采取各种形式，发展与外国、尤其是西非国家的文化合作，并不断发展与法国的传统文化交流。近年来，它还日益重视同其他发达国家的文化交往与合作。
    为了进一步发展文化事业，推动国家经济的发展和社会进步，塞内加尔政府正着手制订一部“文化宪章”。人们相信，这个宪章的颁布和实施将会使这个非洲艺术的百花园变得更加斑斓多姿。
