The first set of triplets born via in vitro fertilization on the Chinese mainland were delivered today at the Third Hospital of Beijing Medical University. The three healthy boys were born between 2:34 AM and 2:41 AM, within a span of 7 minutes. Their weights were 2650 grams, 2210 grams, and 2225 grams, respectively.

The mother, Xu Li, is 29 years old and an ophthalmologist from Anshan, Liaoning Province. She suffered from pelvic tuberculosis and bilateral fallopian tube obstruction and sought treatment at the Third Hospital of Beijing Medical University at the end of last year. She was treated by the renowned obstetrician and gynecologist Professor Zhang Lìzhū. On December 28 of last year, doctors performed a laparotomy to remove the lesions and extracted six eggs. Four of the fertilized embryos that developed well were then implanted into the uterus. Twelve days later, Xu Li's pregnancy test was positive. Two months later, an ultrasound examination revealed three fetuses in her abdomen.

    三胞胎试管婴儿降生
    据新华社北京8月26日电  （记者朱玉）我国大陆首例三胞胎试管婴儿今天在北京医科大学第三医院降生。这三个健康男婴分别降生于2点34分至2点41分的7分钟内，体重分别为2650克、2210克、2225克。
    怀孕36周多的产妇徐丽今年29岁，是辽宁省鞍山的一名眼科大夫。她因患盆腔结核、双侧输卵管梗阻等症于去年年底来北医三院求医，得到了著名妇产科专家张丽珠教授的诊治。去年12月28日，医生为徐丽开腹切除病灶并取出6个卵子，尔后又将4个分裂良好的胚胎植入宫腔，12天后，徐丽妊娠试验为阳性。两个月后，B超检查发现其腹内有3个活胎。
