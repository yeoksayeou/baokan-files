Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, August 11th.

The Jiaodong Peninsula has added another gold-producing county, as Haiyang has begun producing gold for the first time, yielding 90 taels.

This spring, Shandong Province's Haiyang County discovered a sand gold mine with a relatively high gold content in the ancient riverbed of Guocheng Town. This marks the beginning of Haiyang's gold industry. After nearly 70 days of trial smelting, 90.72 taels of refined gold were produced on August 9th, valued at 130,000 yuan, which has been fully remitted to the state treasury. It is estimated that 500 taels of gold will be produced by the end of the year.
