　　The Story of Borrowing a Lantern
    One of the Scattered Notes from the Hong Zhao Campaign
    Jin Sha
    After Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Huoxian were liberated, stories of the Eighth Route Army's strict discipline and not taking a single needle or thread were everywhere. These stories spread from the towns to the vast countryside, bringing infinite excitement and encouragement to the people there.

    On Dehua Street in Hongdong, an old lady told me about her "strange" encounter and her "new discovery."

    Her expression was excited and agitated, her two dry eyes gleaming with surprise, her voice a little trembling:

    "With the roar of artillery fire, my whole family huddled trembling under the table. Zhang Conglong (the puppet military leader entrenched in Hongdong, the county magistrate appointed by Yan Xishan) said that the Eighth Route Army would kill everyone and leave no chickens or dogs alive. I thought that the common people would suffer from the fighting, so I had to pray to God for protection."

    "Suddenly someone knocked on our door. I didn't dare to open it at that moment, but I couldn't not open it! So I slowly opened the door, taking one step forward and one step back. An Eighth Route soldier came in and wanted to borrow a lantern. I was afraid of being beaten, so I hurriedly lent him the lantern. I thought: this lantern is gone for good. I could only pray to God for protection again, just asking for nothing else to happen."

    "My whole family was on pins and needles, not daring to sleep until midnight. Oh no, someone knocked on the door again. I was shaking uncontrollably. I opened the door, and it was the same Eighth Route soldier as before, holding my lantern in his hand. I wondered what else he wanted to borrow. God, please protect us!"

    "Just as I was racking my brains, that Eighth Route soldier smiled and handed over the lantern, saying, "Old lady, isn't this your lantern? I'm returning it to you now. Thank you!"

    "'Old lady, I'm sorry to bother you. You rest!' With that, the Eighth Route soldier gave a proper salute and left."

    "I didn't say a word, standing blankly at the door with the lantern in my hand for a long time..."

    "The next day, several Eighth Route Army officers came out of the Wang family next door and walked to my house. They spoke like juniors to elders. They said that the Eighth Route Army was like my own sons, and if the Eighth Route Army did anything wrong, I should also discipline them. They also asked if I had suffered any losses?"

    "I said, 'You borrowed a lantern from me. When you borrowed it, it was half-full of oil. You used it for one night, and when you returned it, it was full. What other losses could there be?'"

    On her old, wrinkled face, a unique joy of youth was revealed. She wiped her tear-filled eyes with the back of her hand, gazing at my armband with the character "八" (eight) for a long time. Suddenly, she tightly grabbed my arm and said:

    "Comrade, I understand now, the Eighth Route Army is actually our own people!"

　　借马灯的故事
    洪赵战役散记之一
    金沙
    在洪洞、赵城、霍县被解放以后，到处都有着八路军纪律严明、秋毫无犯的故事，这些故事从城镇流传到广大的农村，它们到了那里就带给人们无限的兴奋与鼓舞。
    在洪洞的德化街上，一个老太太向我诉说她的“奇异”的遭遇和她的“新发现”。
    她的神情兴奋而激动，两只干枯的眼内，闪耀着惊喜的光芒，声音有点发抖：
    “炮火连天，俺全家钻在桌子底下发抖，张从龙（盘据洪洞的伪军头子、阎锡山加委的县长）说八路军进来要杀得鸡犬不留，俺想打了仗还不是老百姓吃亏，只得祷告天爷保佑。”
    “忽然有人敲俺家的门，俺这时不敢去开门，但又不能不开呀！就走一步退一步的慢慢的把门开了，进来一个八路，要借一个灯，俺怕挨打，就急忙把马灯借给人家，俺想：这个马灯借去算完了，只好又祷告天爷保佑，只求往后没事。”
    “俺全家人提心吊胆的，直到半夜里都没敢睡觉，糟了，又有人敲门了，俺抖得不成样了，开开门来，又是先前的那个八路，手里提着俺的马灯，俺想不知他又要借什么东西，天爷保佑保佑吧！”
    “俺正在胡思乱想的当儿，人家那个八路却笑嘻嘻地拿过灯来说：“老太太，这不是你的灯吗？现在还你，谢谢你！”
    “‘老太太，对不起，打扰你了，你休息吧！’说着那个八路规规矩矩地打个招呼就走了”。
    “俺一句话也没说，提着马灯在门口呆呆的站了半天……”
    “第二天，几个八路军当官的从隔壁王家走出来又走到俺家来，他们像晚辈对长辈说话的一样，就八路军就是俺的儿子，八路军要是有什么不对，俺也该管教管教。他们又问俺有什么损失没有？”
    “俺说：‘你们借了俺一个马灯，借去时里边是半下子油，用了一黑，还来时却是满满的一下子油，还有啥损失？’”
    在她年老多绉的脸上，流露出年青人特有的欢欣，她用手背擦了擦充泪的眼睛，向我的有着“八”字的臂章凝视了半天，忽然紧紧地抓住我的膀子说：
    “同志，我知道了，八路军原来就是俺自己的人！”
