    Tokyo Dispatch: Shiga Yoshio, one of the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party, met with the Cabinet Secretary on the 6th, lodging a serious protest against the government's measure of taking over radio broadcasting enterprises to suppress worker strikes. The Japanese Radio Workers' Union launched a strike on the 5th, with workers at all Japanese radio stations, except for communications for the American and British occupation forces, ceasing work. On the 6th, the Yoshida government attempted to take over the radio stations to crack down on the strike by completely replacing the workers.
    Tokyo Dispatch: JCP member Masamune was arrested by the Yoshida Cabinet and charged in the Tokyo District Court with so-called "defamation of the Emperor."

In response, Masamune declared: "This slogan is a summary of the current social situation in Japan."
