Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. Shenjitu, Security Commander of the Otog Banner in the Ikezhao League, Chief of Staff Qi Wenfeng, and Adjutant Ri Qingzhabu (acting on behalf of Prince Suochuk Jin Yu's eldest son), a group of eight people, arrived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region last month on the 16th after traversing the Ordos grassland, and came to Yan'an a few days ago. The Northwest Central Bureau of the CCP, the Border Government, and the United Headquarters held a welcoming party in the auditorium of the Border Council the night before last. Liu Jingfan, Vice Chairman of the Border Government, delivered a welcome speech on the spot, inviting Commander Shenjitu to speak. Commander Shenjitu, wearing a blue woolen overcoat and stroking his beard, delivered a speech in Mongolian. He first represented the Mongolian people of the banner in wishing health to the leaders present, and after recounting the history of the ethnic movement in the Otog Banner, he said: "The people of Inner Mongolia have been backward in culture due to the influence of the Kuomintang authorities' policy of deceiving the people for many years, but during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Otog Banner was not affected by disasters, which was entirely due to the Communist Party of China and the Eighth Route Army under its leadership." He said that the purpose of his leading the Mongolian delegation to Yan'an was to follow the CCP and the national democrats in striving for China's independence, democracy, and peace. The People's Theater Troupe performed "Defend Peace" at the evening party to add to the enjoyment.

    【新华社延安五日电】伊克扎盟鄂托克旗保安司令申计秘图，参谋长奇文峰及日清扎布副官（代理王爷所楚克金域的大公子”等，一行八人在横跨鄂尔多斯草原后，于上月十六日抵陕甘宁边区，并于日前来延，前晚中共西北中央局，边府及联司在边参议会大礼堂举行欢迎晚会，边府刘景范副主席即席致欢迎词，请申计秘图司令讲话，申司令着蓝呢大衣，捻八字须，以蒙语演说，他首先代表该旗蒙民祝到会各首长健康，继述及鄂旗民族运动的历史后，说：“内蒙古人民，因多年来遭受到国民党当局的愚民政策的影响，文化落后，但在八年抗战中，鄂旗却没有受到灾害，这完全是中共和它领导下的八路军所赐予的缘故。”他说他率领蒙古参观团来延的目的，是追随中共与全国民主人士之后，为致力于中国的独立、民主、和平而奋斗。晚会上由民众剧团演出“保卫和平”助兴。
