　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Reports from various sources indicate that the United States is experiencing its greatest meat shortage in history. Across the country, there are laments of "no meat to eat," and meat has virtually disappeared from the tables of New York City, a city of over five million people. The American people have expressed extreme resentment towards this situation, as this meat shortage is caused by large slaughterhouses hoarding in order to force prices higher before selling. At the same time, it is generally believed that with the US Congressional elections approaching, the Republican Party must have planned much of the meat shortage, which could be used as evidence of the Democratic Party's incompetence. Democratic candidates have called on Truman for help in order to defeat the Republican strategy. The Truman government's efforts to import meat from Argentina and the United Kingdom have encountered great difficulties.

　　美国肉荒空前严重
    【新华社延安十二日电】各方报导：美国已遭受历史上最大之肉荒，全国各地已有“食无肉”之叹，五百余万人口之纽约餐桌上肉食几已绝迹。美国人民对此已表示异常愤恨，因此次肉荒造成为大屠宰商屯积居奇，以便迫使提高物价，然后出售。同时一般估计美国国会选举举行在即，共和党对肉荒之造成亦必多所策划，借可用作攻击民主党无能之证据。民主党各候选人已向杜鲁门呼救，以便击败共和党之策略。杜鲁门政府向阿根廷及英国输入肉类之举遭到很大的困难。
