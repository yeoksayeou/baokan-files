　　(This dispatch from Yangcheng, 24th) After a year of mass movements, Yan Village in the first district of Jincheng has achieved "land to the tiller." The feudal system of exploitation has been eliminated, and there are no longer landlords or the extremely poor. Fundamental changes have taken place in class relations. More than 80% of the farmers have acquired between two and four mu of land. Those with less than two mu account for only one-tenth of the total population, and those with more than seven mu account for only slightly more than 9% of the total population. Therefore, in this year's autumn harvest, the hardworking farmers have obtained their own harvest for the first time. Among the 84 households in the village, 7 households, accounting for 8% of the total, harvested an average of more than six shi per person. Nineteen households, accounting for 22% of the total, harvested an average of four to six shi per person. Twenty-one households, accounting for slightly more than 25% of the total, harvested an average of three to four shi per person. Twenty-five households, accounting for slightly more than 28% of the total, harvested between two and three shi per person. Only twelve households, accounting for 16% of the total, harvested less than two shi. This means that more than half of the households in the village harvested an average of more than three shi of autumn grain per person. Living conditions have greatly improved. The twelve households with less than two shi per person are also not experiencing any problems due to a better summer harvest this year.

　　阎庄实现耕者有其田半数农民均收粮三石
    【本报阳城廿四日电】晋城一区阎庄村，经过一年群众运动，已实现了耕者有其田。封建剥削制度消灭了，地主与赤贫均不复存在，阶级关系发生了基本变化。十分之八以上的农民取得二亩至四亩土地，二亩以下者仅占全人口的十分之一，七亩以上者亦只占全人口的百分之九强。因此今年秋收中，勤劳耕种的农民第一次获得自己的收获物。该村八十四户中，每人平均收获六石以上者七户，占总户数百分之八。每人平均四石至六石者十九户，占全户数的百分之二十二。每人平均三石至四石者二十一户，占全户数的百分之二十五强。两石至三石者二十五户，占全户数的百分之二十八强。不足两石者仅十二户，占全户数的百分之十六。即是说全村有一半以上户口，平均每人可收秋粮三石以上。生活大为改善，每人不足两石的十二户，因今年夏收较好，生活亦无问题。
