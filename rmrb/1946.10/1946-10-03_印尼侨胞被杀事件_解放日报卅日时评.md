Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: According to various news agencies, fierce fighting has broken out between Indonesians and Overseas Chinese in the Ba Yan area of Sumatra. As of the 25th, over 200 Overseas Chinese have been killed, and another 20,000 are in extreme danger. According to representatives sent to Batavia by local Overseas Chinese, armed Indonesians invaded Ba from neighboring islands on the 14th, killing several Overseas Chinese. Ba is garrisoned by Dutch troops, who are allowing the situation to develop. On the 19th, the Indonesians launched an organized attack. Note: The largest conflict between native Indonesians and local Overseas Chinese was the Wendeng incident near Batavia in May, which resulted in the deaths of 800 Overseas Chinese. According to an analysis by the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Association in Yogyakarta, the Indonesian animosity towards Overseas Chinese is a result of incitement by Dutch imperialists. The Dutch forced Chinese compatriots who had been seized by Japanese寇 to fight against Indonesians, causing misunderstandings. After the Wendeng incident, the Nanjing government's Consul General in Batavia requested the Dutch army to issue weapons to the Overseas Chinese to fight against Indonesians, which aroused even greater dissatisfaction among the Indonesian government and people.

The conflict between our compatriots in the Ba Yan area of Sumatra and the Indonesian people has resulted in the sacrifice of 200 Overseas Chinese. This is another unfortunate event following the massacre of Overseas Chinese in the Wendeng area of Java in late May. Our compatriots at home and abroad express infinite concern for the safety of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies and regret the bloodshed between the Dutch East Indies people and our compatriots, who are both oppressed by imperialism.

The tragedy occurred primarily because the Dutch authorities systematically incited the feelings between the Chinese and Indonesian people. The Dutch forced our domestic compatriots, who had been seized by Japanese寇 to fight in the Dutch army against the Indonesian Republic, causing misunderstandings and animosity towards Overseas Chinese in some war zones. This is precisely what the Dutch imperialist elements hoped for. They hoped to divert the Indonesian hatred of Dutch invaders to the Overseas Chinese. They hoped that Indonesia and the Overseas Chinese would be weakened in the conflict, weakening both the Indonesian revolutionary forces and the status of the Overseas Chinese, thus facilitating their re-domination of Indonesia and the seizure of all the interests of the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. This is a common and vicious double-edged trick used by imperialist elements. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek government must bear major responsibility for this bloody incident. This government relies on the breath of imperialist elements, opposes its own people internally, opposes the independence movements of weak nations externally, and exchanges the lives and tears of Overseas Chinese for the pleasure of imperialists. When the Wendeng incident occurred, the Chiang Kai-shek government's Consul General in Batavia not only failed to conduct necessary negotiations, mediation, and propaganda with the Indonesian Republican government and people, so that both sides could reach a reasonable agreement, but instead stood on the side of the Dutch authorities in every way, begging for help from the Dutch authorities and asking them to issue guns to the Overseas Chinese, gradually turning the Overseas Chinese into tools and sacrifices of the Dutch war of aggression against Indonesia. This aided the Dutch imperialists' vicious plan to incite the Indonesian people against the Overseas Chinese, and in turn, harmed the lives and property of our compatriots.

Our Chinese people and the Indonesian people have no hatred to speak of. We are both fighting for national independence and freedom and can be called brothers in distress. Our Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people are even more closely related and suffer the same oppression from Dutch imperialism. They should unite and seek liberation together. The Ba Yan incident and the previous Wendeng incident should not have occurred. We hope that the Indonesian Republic authorities recognize the Dutch imperialists' tricks, value the common interests of the Chinese and Indonesian people, appropriately mediate the disputes between our Overseas Chinese and the local Indonesian people, fairly compensate the murdered Overseas Chinese, stop the killings of our Overseas Chinese, and explain to the Indonesian people that Chiang Kai-shek's policy of working for imperialism is opposed by the Chinese people and the Overseas Chinese. At the same time, we hope that the Overseas Chinese in the East Indies will prioritize the unity of the Chinese people, not fall for the Dutch authorities' incitement, and not be deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek government's policy of relying on imperialist elements. We must resolutely refuse to participate in the Dutch imperialist war against Indonesia. Overseas Chinese organizations must organize themselves to carry out national diplomacy to safeguard their own interests, conduct extensive propaganda to the Indonesian people to eliminate the hatred between the Indonesian people and the Overseas Chinese, and develop the friendship and cooperation between the Indonesian people and the Overseas Chinese. This is the correct path to the safety of our compatriots.

　　印尼侨胞被杀事件
    解放日报卅日时评
    【新华社延安卅日电】据各通讯社报导：苏门答腊巴硭地区印尼人与华侨发生激战，迄廿五日止，已有二百余华侨被杀，另二万华侨正陷于最危险境地。据当地华侨派至巴达维亚的代表称：武装印尼人于十四日自邻岛侵入巴，杀害华侨若干，巴门为荷军所镇守，荷方听任事件发展，十九日印尼人遂发动有组织的袭击。按：印尼土著与当地华侨发生冲突，最大一次为五月间巴达维城附近的文登事件，华侨死亡达八百人。据日惹华侨协会主席分析，印尼人对华侨的仇视乃荷兰帝国主义者挑拨的结果，荷方强迫使用前被日寇抓赴南洋的我国同胞，对印尼人作战，致造成印尼人对华侨的误会。文登事件后，南京政府驻巴达维亚总领事，曾要求荷军发枪械予华侨，以对印尼作战，致引起印尼朝野更大不满。
    苏门答腊巴门地方我国侨胞与印尼人民发生冲突，已有二百侨胞牺牲，这是继五月下旬爪哇文登地区侨胞遭受屠杀后的又一不幸事件。我国内外同胞对于荷印侨胞的安全表示无限的关切，对于同受帝国主义压迫的荷印人民与我侨胞发生流血事件表示惋惜。
    这惨剧的发生，首先是由于荷兰当局有计划的挑拨中国和印尼两民族的感情，荷方强迫被日寇抓到东印度的我国内同胞参加荷军，进攻印尼人民共和国，致造成若干战线地区印尼人对华侨的误会和仇视。这正是荷帝国主义分子所希望的，他们希望把印尼人对荷兰侵略者的仇恨转移到华侨身上去，他们希望印尼和华侨在冲突中两败俱伤，既削弱印尼革命力量，又削弱华侨的地位，这样就便利他们重新统治印尼和夺取华侨在印尼的所有利益。这是帝国主义分子常用的恶毒的一箭双雕办法。同时蒋介石政府也要为这流血事件负重大责任，这个政府仰帝国主义分子鼻息，对内反对本国人民，对外反对弱小民族的独立运动，并拿侨胞的生命血泪来换得帝国主义者的欢心。当文登事件发生后，蒋介石政府驻巴达维亚总领事，不但未向印尼共和政府人民进行必要的交涉调解和宣传，使双方能够取得合理的协议，他反而处处站在荷兰当局方面，向荷兰当局乞援，请荷兰当局发枪给华侨，一步一步地把华侨变成荷兰对印尼侵略战争的工具和牺牲品，这样助成了荷兰帝国主义者挑拨印尼人民与华侨的恶毒计划，复而侵害我侨胞的生命财产。
    我们中国人民与印尼人民本来没有什么仇恨可言，我们都是为民族的独立自由而奋斗，堪称难兄难弟。我国侨胞与印尼人民更是休戚相关，同受荷兰帝国主义的压迫，自应团结一致，共谋解放。此次巴门事件以及前此的文登事件，都是不应该出现的。希望印尼共和国当局认识荷兰帝国主义的诡计，重视中印人民的共同利益，适当的调解我侨胞与当地印尼人民的纠纷，公平地抚恤被杀的华侨，制止杀害我侨胞的事件，并向印尼人民解释清楚蒋介石为帝国主义作伥的政策是受中国人民和华侨所反对的。同时我们又希望东印各地侨胞以中国人民团结为重，不中荷兰当局的挑拨毒计，更不要为蒋介石政府代表事件仰承帝国主义鼻息的政策所惑。我们要坚决拒绝参加荷兰帝国主义进攻印尼的战争，华侨各界团体要组织起来，进行维护自身利益的国民外交，对印尼人民进行广泛的宣传，消除印尼人民与华侨间的仇恨，发展印尼人民与华侨的友谊合作，这样才是我们侨胞安全的正确道路。
