　　The Path of National Industrialists
    ——Introducing Mr. Wang Yinggu and Yongsheng Chemical Factory
    Rong Yinong

National industry is being devastated and annexed in the Kuomintang areas, while it is being cherished and supported in the Liberated Areas. National industrialists are being squeezed out and persecuted in the Kuomintang areas, while they are welcomed and respected in the Liberated Areas. National industry and national industrialists are on the verge of extinction in the Kuomintang areas, while they are heading towards infinitely bright development prospects in the Liberated Areas. Mr. Wang Yinggu, a national industrialist who came to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area from Gansu, and the Yongsheng Chemical Factory he founded here, are the best proof.

Mr. Wang founded alkali-making industries twice in Gansu, and both times they were annexed and crushed by Kuomintang bureaucratic capital. However, with his broad vision, firm courage, and魄力[pò lì - boldness; resolution], he came to the Liberated Area, and after only half a year of effort, the machines of another large-scale chemical factory have already begun to turn.

The facts tell us that Mr. Wang Yinggu has already opened up a new path for national industrialists in the Kuomintang areas.

Mr. Wang is originally from Shandong. He is an alkali-making expert who is not involved in politics and focuses on the chemical industry. In the spring of 1940, he and four classmates from Yenching University pooled their shares and opened an alkali plant in Lanzhou. By 1943, it was able to produce sodium sulfide on a large scale. Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists Du Yuesheng and Wang Zhengting saw that the alkali plant run by Mr. Wang and others had great development prospects, so they ordered the alkali plant to merge into the Kuomintang-run Gansu Hexi Industrial Company, becoming the Lanzhou Alkali Plant of the company.

From then on, Mr. Wang and others felt that national capitalists had no future in the Kuomintang areas. At the same time, Mr. Wang had many classmates working in the Liberated Areas. From them, he heard that the Liberated Areas welcomed national capitalists to invest in industry and commerce, and that they could also get help from the democratic government and the broad masses of the people. From that time on, he longed to come to the Liberated Area to set up a factory. However, because of the Kuomintang reactionaries' heavy restrictions and blockades, he could not realize it for a while. He began to swallow his anger and look for another way out.

Later, Mr. Wang discovered saltpeter and coal mines in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, and began to operate arduously, creating enterprises for soda ash and sodium sulfide. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists hoarding and speculating massively dumped American goods, and Mr. Wang's alkali plant was once again squeezed out and completely collapsed. The machinery and assets in the alkali plant were all annexed by the Kuomintang-run Gansu Hexi Industrial Company. Mr. Wang felt more deeply that staying in the Kuomintang area was a dead end, so he resolutely detoured through the Ping-Sui Railway to the Liberated Area to set up a factory.

In the late autumn of last year, Mr. Wang encountered the Kuomintang army's large-scale offensive against Suiyuan and the various threats of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Ningxia. He tried all kinds of methods, detoured through Zhengzhou, Henan, crossed the Yellow River, and after experiencing all kinds of hardships, finally arrived in Jiaozuo.

The disturbances and fatigue along the way caused Mr. Wang's years of stomach problems to flare up again. But as soon as he arrived in Jiaozuo—the location of the Fourth Administrative Office of Taihang—his spirit immediately relaxed and became cheerful. Mr. Wang said when he met me: "We received all kinds of cordial care from the Fourth Administrative Office of Taihang. Commissioner Du Yu personally received us, which made me feel that the Liberated Area is truly a cordial and happy big family. I came to Jiaozuo to further understand the policies and situation of the Liberated Area, which further strengthened my determination to set up a factory in the Liberated Area."

After Mr. Wang arrived at the Border Region Government, as soon as he heard that national capitalists Mr. Shi Lihe and Mr. Cui Zhicheng were going to start a chemical factory, he asked to participate.

Under the policy of "private operation with public assistance, rewarding industry," the Liberated Area government never gives up any opportunity to help private individuals start factories. After Mr. Wang and Mr. Shi and Mr. Cui decided to start a factory, the Border Region Chemical Research Institute immediately asked the Jinnan Bank to lend 15 million yuan in low-interest loans to supplement their private capital and help the chemical factory succeed.

Capital was available, but there was no machinery. Under the Kuomintang's strict blockade, machinery could not be imported. But Mr. Wang grasped a rule, that is, the industry of the Liberated Area, like other construction in the Liberated Area, is developed from nothing to something, and from something to greatness and soundness. Therefore, he confidently proposed: "If we don't have machines, let's go to various places to collect them."

Mr. Wang, carrying his stomach problems, ran around and went to many cities and villages to collect the mechanical parts and scrap copper and iron destroyed by the enemy. With the help of the democratic governments in various places, he found one piece here and put together one piece there. By the beginning of August, they had already installed a 20-horsepower boiler with power, four sets of boilers without power, and one set of boilers. There was also a 20-horsepower car head with power, and blowers, sprayers, pumps, distillation pots and various parts and tools. Mr. Wang said excitedly:

"These many machines are invaluable treasures. With these things, the chemical factory doesn't have to worry."

The success of the career made his stomach problems better.

With the machines, they started to build factory buildings. Now they have built more than 40 spacious large houses, and there are still 30 to 40 rooms under construction. Various raw materials are also ready. While continuing to build houses, they continue to collect various machines. Soon, the local alkali in the Border Region can be made into refined alkali, and the local salt can be made into refined salt. Magnesium carbonate can also be extracted from salt making to make paper; glycerin can be extracted from alkali-making soap to develop various industries.

They believe that this chemical factory can develop permanently in the Liberated Area and has unlimited prospects, so it is named "Yongsheng Chemical Factory."

Now, the soap factory of Yongsheng Chemical Factory has started operations and has begun to produce some soda ash. The glory of the success of the career began to shine on Mr. Wang's face, and his family life is also becoming more and more happy. His wife, Ms. Wu Manhui, went to the Liberated Area and immediately fulfilled her desire to study, and has gone to Northern University to study. The democratic government is trying to bring his old mother, who has been separated from him for more than eight years, from Shandong to reunite them.

When the reporter asked him what he thought about setting up a factory in the Liberated Area, he pondered for a while and said, "I now quite regret that if I had made up my mind to come earlier, the scale of this chemical factory would definitely be larger."

　　民族工业家之路
    ——介绍王膺固先生和永生化学工厂
    荣一农
    民族工业在国民党区横遭摧残吞并，而在解放区则备受爱护扶持，民族工业家在国民党区横遭排挤和迫害，而来到解放区则备受欢迎和尊重，民族工业和民族工业家在国民党区奄奄一息，而在解放区则正走向无限光辉的发展前途。从甘肃来到晋冀鲁豫解放区的民族工业家王膺固先生，和他在这里创办起来的永生化学工厂，就是最好的证明。
    王先生两次在甘肃创办制碱工业，两次都被国民党官僚资本所吞并、压垮。但是，凭着远大的眼光、坚毅的勇气和魄力，他来到了解放区，经过短短半年余的努力，另一座规模宏大的化学工厂的机器已有一部分开始转动了。
    事实告诉我们：王膺固先生已经替国民党区的民族工业家们开辟了一条新的道路。
    王先生原籍山东，是一个不问政治专心致力于化学工业的制碱专家。民国二十九年春天，他和燕京大学四位同学集股，在兰州开办了一个制碱厂，到三十二年，已能大规模的制造硫化碱。国民党官僚资本家杜月笙和王正廷看见王先生等办的制碱厂很有发展前途，就勒令这个制碱厂并入国民党官办的甘肃省河西实业公司，成为该公司的兰州制碱厂。
    王先生等从此就感到了民族资本家在国民党区域是没有前途的，同时，王先生有很多同学在解放区工作，从他们那里他听说解放区欢迎民族资本家投资经营工商业，并且还能得到民主政府及广大人民的帮助。从那时起，他就憧憬着到解放区来办工厂。但因为国民党反动派重重的限制、封锁、一时未能实现。他开始忍气吞声的另谋出路。
    后来，王先生又在甘肃省的永昌县境发现了硝磺和煤矿，开始艰苦的经营，又创造了纯碱和硫化碱的企业。日寇投降后，囤集居奇的国民党官僚资本家大量倾销美货，王先生的制碱厂又被排挤得全部垮台。制碱厂里的机器、资财，又全部被国民党官办的甘肃省河西实业公司所吞并，王先生更深切的感觉到留在国民党区只有死路一条，就毅然绕道平绥路，到解放区来开办工厂。
    去年秋末，王先生在宁夏遇到国民党军大举进攻绥西及蒋特的种种威胁，想尽各种办法，辗转绕道河南郑州，渡过黄河，又经历了种种艰难困苦，终于到了焦作。
    沿途的惊扰和疲劳，使王先生多年的胃病又发作了。但是一到焦作——太行四专署的所在地，他的精神立刻轻松愉快起来。王先生见我时说：“我们受到太行四专署种种亲切的照顾，杜毓＠专员亲自招待我们，使我感到解放区真是一个亲切愉快的大家庭。我到焦作进一步了解了解放区的政策和情况，更坚定了在解放区办工厂的决心。”
    王先生到了边区政府后，一听说解放区民族资本家史立和崔之成两先生要创办化学工厂，他就要求参加。
    在“民办公助、奖励工业”的政策下，解放区政府从不放弃任何一个帮助私人创办工厂的机会。王先生和史、崔两先生决定创办工厂之后，边区化学研究所就立刻商请冀南银行贷给一千五百万元的低利贷款，以补他们私人资本的不足，帮助这个化学工厂的成功。
    资本是有了，但是没有机器，在国民党严密的封锁下，机器又进不来。但是王先生掌握了一个规律，即解放区的工业和解放区的其他建设一样，是由无到有，由有到壮大和健全的。因此他充满信心的提议：“没有机器，咱们到各地去收集。”
    王先生带着自己的胃病，东奔西走，到许多城市和乡村中去收集敌寇破坏了的机械零件和碎铜烂铁，在各地民主政府的多方帮助下，东找一件，西凑一件，到八月初，他们已经把收集起的零件装置起有动力的二十匹马力的锅炉，没有动力的四节锅炉和一节锅炉各一套，还有一付有动力的二十匹马力的汽车头，和鼓风机，喷雾机、抽水机、蒸溜锅及各种零件工具。王先生兴奋的说：
    “这许多机械、都是无价宝，有了这些东西，化学工厂就不愁了。”
    事业的成功兴奋得胃病也好了。
    有了机器，他们就着手建筑厂房，现在已经建筑起四十多间宽敞的大房舍，正在建筑中的还有三四十间。各种原料亦已齐备。他们一面继续建筑房舍，一面继续搜集各种机器，不久就可把边区的土碱制成精碱、土盐制成精盐。制盐时还可提出炭酸镁造纸；从制碱造肥皂中提炼甘油，开展各种工业。
    他们相信这个化学工厂在解放区可以永久发展，前途无量，所以命名为“永生化学工厂。”
    现在，永生化学工厂的肥皂厂已经开工，并开始出一部分纯碱。事业成功的光辉开始在王先生的脸上照耀，而他的家庭生活也日益美满，他的夫人吴曼辉女士到了解放区，马上满足了求学的愿望，已经到北方大学去读书了。民主政府正设法从山东把他离别了八年多的老母接了来，使他们母子重获团圆。
    记者问到他到解放区办工厂有什么感想，他沉思了一会说：“我现在颇为后悔，如果我早一点下定决心来，这个化学工厂的规模一定更大些。”
