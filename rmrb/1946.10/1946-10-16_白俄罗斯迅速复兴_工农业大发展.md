Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 13th dispatch: Minsk News - Due to the rapid pace of recovery work, the current industrial output of the Belorussian Republic has increased by 21 times compared to the spring of 1913. During the war, the Hitler bandits destroyed all the country's industry and took away all the equipment. After the war, several large factories were rebuilt in a short period of time, and agriculture is also recovering. Near the country's towns and villages, 200,000 houses have been built, and more than 900,000 people have moved into new homes. 11,000 schools with approximately 1.5 million students have reopened, and dozens of special secondary schools, universities, and colleges have been restored. The new five-year plan stipulates that Belarus's industrial output will increase by at least 16 percent compared to pre-war levels. The funds allocated to the country's major projects are 69.5 billion rubles, which is more than the previous three five-year plans combined. Machine manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing will be greatly developed. A quarter of Belarus is forest, and several civil engineering factories are about to start work, with the construction area reaching 5.3 million acres by 1950.

　　白俄罗斯迅速复兴
    工农业大发展
    【新华社延安十三日电】明斯克讯：由于恢复工作的迅速，目前白俄罗斯共和国工业产品较一九一三年春增加二十一倍。战时希特勒匪徒摧毁了该国所有的工业，拿走了一切装备，战后若干大工厂在较短时期内已重建，农业也正在恢复中。在该国村镇附近，已修建起二十万所房屋，九十万以上的人民已迁入新居，容有约一百五十万学生的一万一千所学校已重开，几十所特别中等学校、大学、专科学校已恢复，新五年计划规定白俄罗斯工业产量至少较战前增加百分之十六。分配于该国主要工作的资金为六十九万万五千万卢布，较战前三次五年计划还要多。机器制造及机器工具制造业将大大发展。白俄罗斯四分之一都是森林，若干土木工厂即将开工、工地面积至一九五○年将达到五百三十万公亩。
