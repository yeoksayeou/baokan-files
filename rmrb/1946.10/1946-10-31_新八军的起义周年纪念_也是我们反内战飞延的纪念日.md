　　The Anniversary of the New Eighth Army's Uprising
    Is Also the Anniversary of Our Anti-Civil War Flight to Yan'an

    Last September, we returned to the embrace of our victorious motherland with joyful hearts. However, after a short stay in Shanghai, we saw that the government's receiving personnel were corrupt, selfish, autocratic, and lawless. Major traitors were at large, and some even became high-ranking officials in the Chiang government. Wherever these KMT officials took over, the common people unanimously said it was worse than under the enemy and puppet regime, and some even longed for the days of the Japanese. Such acts of harming the country and the people made our lives depressed and unhappy, and listening to Yan'an's broadcasts at night was our only entertainment. I envied the lives of the people in the Liberated Areas, and I yearned for the revolutionary holy land—Yan'an. One day, I heard the news of General Gao Shuxun's uprising on Yan'an's radio, and my spirit was unexpectedly excited. My life seemed to have gained a new strength, and I vaguely saw a new path of light. General Gao's uprising gave us new enlightenment. During the fifteen-day ceasefire this June, the Kuomintang army, under Chiang Kai-shek's order, actively prepared to attack the Liberated Areas. At this time, we were ordered to transport military supplies. We really couldn't go against our conscience any longer, so we responded to Chairman Mao's call to oppose the American aid to Chiang law, and responded to the peaceful demonstration of 100,000 people in Shanghai. On June 26th, we came to Yan'an—this happy shore of the people. Our flight to Yan'an was entirely inspired by General Gao Shuxun's uprising; therefore, it can be said that October 30th is also the anniversary of our flight to Yan'an.

　　新八军的起义周年纪念
    也是我们反内战飞延的纪念日
    刘善本
    去年九月，我们怀着欢娱的心情，由美国回到了胜利的祖国的怀抱。然而，当我们在上海住了一个短时期，我们看到的是政府接收人员腐败、自私、专横、犯法，大汉奸逍遥法外，还有的作了蒋政府的高官，凡是经过这些国府官员接收过的地方，一般人民都异口同声的说还不如敌伪时代，大有些追念日本人之慨。这种祸国殃民的行为，使我们的生活变得抑郁不乐，只有在晚上听延安的广播作为唯一的娱乐。我羡慕着解放区人民的生活，我遥慕着革命的圣地——延安。一天从延安广播里听到了高树勋将军起义的消息，我的精神上受到了一种意外的兴奋，我的生命似乎获得了一种新的力量，隐约的望见了一条新的光明之路。高将军的起义，给了我们新的启示。今年六月十五天停战期间，国民党军队在蒋介石手令下，积极布署准备进攻解放区，这时我们被命令着去运送军火，我们实在不能再昧着良心，于是便响应了毛主席反对美国援蒋法案的号召，响应了上海十万群众的和平示威游行，在六月二十六日，我们来到了延安——这个幸福的人民之岸上。我们的飞来延安，完全是高树勋将军的起义给了我们的启示；所以，可以说十月三十日也是我们飞来延安的纪念日。
