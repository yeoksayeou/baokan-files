　　【This newspaper, Handan, 24th】General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, recently gave an interview to this newspaper's reporter regarding the current situation. General Liu began by stating: "While Chiang Kai-shek is continuing his mad offensive against the Liberated Areas with more than 85% of his forces, he is releasing a smokescreen of peace. The so-called 'impartial mediators' from America, and the ridiculous politicians of the Youth Party, acting as supporting players for the Kuomintang, are doing their best to exaggerate this. But this is just a vicious irony. Now, the Chiang troops fighting in the Juye and Jiaxiang areas of the Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area are none other than the American-equipped Fifth Army and Eighteenth Army (Organized Eleventh Division), using all kinds of American weapons. Coordinating with this, those indiscriminately bombing our peaceful residents are none other than American-made planes and flying fortresses." General Liu sternly pointed out: "If Chiang Kai-shek had even a little bit of sincerity for peace, why would he issue a 'Communist Suppression Handbook' while holding the Double Tenth negotiations? Why would he sign the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference with one hand, and then destroy these agreements with the other, mobilizing large armies to attack us? It is very clear that today's 'peace' smokescreen is just a conspiracy to shift the responsibility for the war onto the Communist Party, and to cover up his larger-scale military offensive. Therefore, the more Chiang Kai-shek sings of 'peace,' the more we must be vigilant against his inhumane bloody slaughter!" General Liu warned Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries not to be overly happy because the People's Army has temporarily withdrawn from cities such as Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Heze, and Huaiyin. We have never valued the gains and losses of one city or one place, because what determines the war is not one city or one place, but the ebb and flow of living strength. In the past three months, we have already eliminated 25 brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and captured alive several thousand officers, including Zhao Xitian, commander of the Tenth Army. His most elite first-class American-equipped Fifth Army and the Eighteenth Army have also suffered more than 6,000 casualties recently in Juye Longwangji and Zhangfengji. If Chiang Kai-shek insists on playing tricks and does not honestly withdraw from all illegally occupied Liberated Area land, implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and restore the position of January 13th, we will never stop our just self-defense resistance, and will give him an even more severe counterattack. We firmly believe that in the near future, we will continue to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's second 25 brigades, his third 25 brigades, capture alive the second Zhao Xitian, and the third Zhao Xitian, until we completely smash his offensive, recover all lost territories, restore domestic peace, and realize the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference!"

　　刘伯承司令警告蒋介石
    如不退出侵占地区我决予更沉重反击
    蒋越高唱“和平”我更须警惕其血腥屠杀
    【本报邯郸二十四日电】晋冀鲁豫军区司令员刘伯承将军顷就目前形势对本社记者发表谈话，刘将军首称：“蒋介石在以百分之八十五以上的兵力继续向解放区疯狂进攻之时，放出和平烟幕，所谓‘公正调停’的美国人，充当国民党配角的青年党无聊政客，正竭力从旁渲染。但这只是恶毒的讽刺，现在，在冀鲁豫解放区巨野、嘉祥地区作战的蒋军不是别的，而是美械的第五军和十八军（整十一师），使用着一切种类的美式武器；与此配合向我和平居民滥肆轰炸的也不是别的，而是美造的飞机和空中堡垒。”刘将军严正指出：“如果蒋介石有一点点和平诚意的话，为什么一面举行双十谈判，又一面颁发‘剿共手册’？为什么一手签订停战令和政协决议，又一面一手破坏这些协议，调动大军向我进攻？很显然的，今天的‘和平’烟幕只是阴谋把战争的责任推卸到共产党身上，掩盖其更大规模的军事进攻。因此，蒋介石越是高唱‘和平’，我们越要警惕他毫无人性的血腥屠杀！”刘将军警告蒋介石和美国反动派，不要因为人民军队暂时撤离张家口、承德、荷泽、淮阴这些城市而过分高兴；我们从来没有看重一城一地的得失，因为决定战争的不是一城一地，而是有生力量的消长。三个月以来，我们已消灭了蒋介石二十五个旅，活捉第十军军长赵锡田以下军官数千，其最精锐的第一等美械部队第五军及第十八军也在最近巨野龙＠集、张凤集损失六千人以上。如果蒋介石一味耍阴谋，而不老老实实的从所有非法侵占的解放区土地上退出去，实行政协决议，恢复一月十三日的位置，我们决不停止正义的自卫抵抗，并且会给他更沉重的反击。我们坚信在不久的时间内，我们将继续消灭蒋介石第二个二十五个旅，第三个二十五个旅，活捉第二个赵锡田，第三个赵锡田，直到彻底粉碎其进攻，收复一切失地，恢复国内和平实现政协决议为止！”
