Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The area of activity of the Sichuan People's Armed Uprising has expanded to seventy-four counties. In addition to the previously reported sixty-one counties, according to Chongqing and Chengdu newspapers in August and September, People's Armed Uprisings have also been discovered in Jiangjin, Qijiang, Qingfu, Zizhong, Ziyang, Pengshui, Liangshan, Dazhu, Fengdu, Jiangbei, Leshan, Renshou, and Meishan counties. In southern Sichuan, Chen Zhanrong's troops, numbering about 400, are based in Tucao and Wenshui on the Sichuan-Guizhou border. They have recently frequently attacked Chiang's troops in Jiangjin and Qijiang. This unit is fully equipped with rifles and machine guns, including dozens of machine guns. The People's Armed Uprising in various townships of Qingfu County are also quite active, relying on the mountainous terrain. In central Sichuan, at the junction of Zizhong, Ziyang, and Lezhi counties, there is also a People's Armed Uprising of several hundred people, possessing many Zhongzheng rifles, semi-automatic machine guns, light machine guns, and several small cannons. The troops are strictly disciplined and "there are no incidents of looting" (September 1st, Chengdu New China Daily Ziyang Communication). In eastern Sichuan, in Pengshui, Liangshan, Dazhu, Fengdu, Jiangbei and other counties, several People's Armed forces of hundreds and dozens of people appeared in August. On September 2nd, a unit of dozens of fully armed people rushed into Shaping Township (under the jurisdiction of Jiangbei County), only forty miles away from Chongqing, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Zhuang Ding of the landlord Xu Yaoguang's family for more than two hours. Finally, they blew open the gate of Xu's house and forced all of his Zhuang Ding to surrender, but no one was injured. The People's Armed Uprising in western Sichuan have recently been active in Leshan, Renshou, and Meishan. The various ferries on the upper reaches of the Minjiang River are frequently controlled. According to the Chongqing National Daily News on September 18th, Chen Ruixiang's troops on the Sichuan-Guizhou border have recently moved to the Renjiangling area, about one hundred miles away from the Gulan county seat.
