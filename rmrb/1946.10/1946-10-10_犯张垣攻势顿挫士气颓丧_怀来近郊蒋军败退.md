Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui East Line, 7th: Chiang's troops on the Ping-Sui East Line, who fiercely attacked Huailai City, have suffered 5,700 casualties, causing their offensive to falter and their morale to plummet. The battle line has retreated from the vicinity of Huailai to a line 20 *li* east of Huailai. On the 5th and 6th, the Chiang side constantly sent planes to harass and reconnoiter, and skirmishes continued between the two sides' outposts, but there were no fierce battles. Currently, Chiang's troops are reorganizing their defeated forces, planning to wait for reinforcements before attacking again. After heavily damaging the invading Chiang troops, the heroic Eighth Route Army soldiers on the front line are in high spirits and are waiting in a strict formation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Chiang Kai-shek's military system is in chaos because Chiang's troops suffered severe setbacks on the Ping-Sui East Line and the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, with losses of over 10,000 men. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on the 6th, "When Chiang's troops were blocked from advancing on Zhangjiakou and Baoding was attacked," "the civil war suddenly turned in favor of the CCP," and senior Chiang military personnel quickly gathered in Peiping "to hold a special meeting." Chief of Staff Chen Cheng also rushed to Peiping on the 4th. Previously, a spokesman for the Peiping Executive Headquarters had falsely claimed that there was "absolutely no such thing" as an attack on Zhangjiakou, but a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 5th stated: When reporters asked Bai Chongxi whether there was a possibility of a ceasefire in the attack on Zhangjiakou, Bai replied: "A ceasefire in one area will not help the matter." This shows that Chiang Kai-shek is determined to attack Zhangjiakou, plunging China into complete division. The Central News Agency dared not disclose a single word about the Chiang troops' recent series of failures on the Ping-Sui East Line. However, following the lie of "occupying Huailai," the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station said on the 6th that they had "occupied Shacheng and Xiahuayuan." In response, the Zhangjiakou Jin-Cha-Ji Daily's commentary, "A Week of Defense in Chahar Province," stated: "Indeed, Chiang's troops not only arrived at Huailai, have been to Shacheng and Xiahuayuan, but also to Zhangjiakou. But, unfortunately, they all had no weapons."

### 犯张垣攻势顿挫士气颓丧  怀来近郊蒋军败退

　　犯张垣攻势顿挫士气颓丧
    怀来近郊蒋军败退
    【新华社平绥东线七日电】向怀来城猛击之平绥东线蒋军在损失五千七百人后，攻势顿挫，士气极为颓丧，战线已由怀来近郊后退至怀来东二十里一线。五六两日，蒋方不断以飞机出扰、侦察，双方前哨仍不断冲突，但无激烈战斗。现蒋军正整顿败军，图待增援再犯。前线八路军健儿在重创进犯蒋军后，士气旺盛，严阵以待。
    【新华社延安七日电】蒋介石的军事系统，因蒋军在平绥东线及平汉北段遭受了万余人损失的严重顿挫，手忙脚乱起来。据美联社北平六日电称：“当蒋军向张家口前进被阻，保定受击，”“内战突然一转而有利于中共时，”蒋军高级军事人员迅即群集北平，“举行特别会议”。而参谋总长陈诚亦于四日急忙赶到北平。前时北平行辕发言人曾诡称进攻张垣“绝无其事”，但合众社五日南京电称：记者询问白崇禧进攻张家口有无停止可能时，白氏答：“一个地区之停战无补于事。”足见蒋介石决心进攻张家口，陷中国于全面破裂。对于蒋军最近平绥东线接二连三的失败，中央社不敢披露一个字。但继“占领怀来”的谎言后，六日南京中央广播电台竟说他们已经“占领了沙城、下花园”。对此，张家口晋察冀日报《察省一周保卫战》的时评中称：“的确，蒋军不但到达怀来，到过沙城、下花园，而且也到了张家口。但是，可惜他们都是已经没有武器了的。”
