　　【Xinhua News Agency, Suimeng Front, 14th】The Eighth Route Army at Julebao, 50 miles east of Datong, has repelled three invasions by Ma Zhanshan's cavalry in recent days. The Ping-Sui Railway, from Julebao in the west to the outskirts of Zhangjiakou in the east, is still under the effective control of the Eighth Route Army. On the 12th, two regiments of Ma Zhanshan's cavalry stationed at Shilipu, ten miles east of Datong, invaded Julebao town, but were unsuccessfully met with a vigorous counterattack by a certain regiment of our defending troops. Until the evening, Ma's troops fiercely attacked Qianjiashan, five miles south and eight miles southwest of the town, but the Eighth Route Army firmly defended its position and repelled them. In the battle until 4:00 a.m. on the 13th, the enemy circled around to attack Julebao Station and Zhangjiazhuang south of the town, and were again severely attacked, with heavy casualties to Ma's troops. They are currently in a standoff.
