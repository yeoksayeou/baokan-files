　　Cruel Landlord Ruthlessly Starves Hired Laborer to Death, Seizes His Meager Property
    Masses in Five Villages of Bo'ai Grieve for the Deceased and Demand Revenge and Compensation
    [This newspaper Bo'ai News] More than 1,200 workers and peasants from five villages, including Beishi in Bo'ai, gathered to struggle against the tyrannical landlord Zhang Siyin and to mourn Zhang Chunfu, a hired laborer who was starved to death by him. Chunfu had worked for Zhang as a hired laborer for fifteen years. He was known for his loyalty, diligence, early rising, late working, meticulous farming, and was praised by the masses. However, Zhang was inherently cruel and exploited him in every possible way. Using the excuse of famine, he deducted food rations. Chunfu suffered from hunger, was weak in all four limbs, but still persisted in working, and finally starved to death on the way while carrying coal. Zhang, on the contrary, seized all of his ancestral property of four and a half mu of land, pots, bowls, and clothing. The hired laborer Zhang Shuhao carried water for Zhang's family, but Zhang refused to drink the second bucket, saying, "It has fart on it!" The hired laborer Zhang Cheng had all his teeth kicked out by livestock and was almost driven out the door by Zhang. Zhang's cruelty towards hired laborers was well known to everyone, young and old. At the meeting, the masses roared slogans such as "Oppose mistreatment of hired laborers, improve the lives of workers," demanded a settlement of wages from Zhang, and questioned, "Why did you starve Zhang Chunfu to death? Did you want to seize his land and kill him?" Zhang was at a loss for words and admitted to compensating the masses for their losses and providing a proper burial for the deceased.

    博爱五村群众痛悼死者复仇索债
    【本报博爱讯】博爱北史等五个村一千二百多工、农群众，集会斗争恶霸地主张思寅，并追悼被其饿死的雇工张纯福。纯福给张当雇工达十五年，忠厚勤谨，起早搭黑，精耕细作，为群众所一致称道；讵张刻毒成性，多方虐待压榨，并借口灾荒，克扣饭食；纯福饱受饥饿，四肢无力，仍坚持劳动，终于驮煤时饿死途中。张反将其祖产四亩半地及锅碗衣物全部霸占。雇工张述好给张家担水，张不吃后一桶，说：“放上屁了！”雇工张成被牲口踢掉了满口牙，差点被张赶出大门。张刻薄雇工的恶毒，妇孺皆知。会上群众怒吼：“反对虐待雇工，改善工人生活”等口号，向张清算工资，质问“为啥要饿死张纯福？是不是想霸占他的地，就要害死他？”张理屈词穷，承认包赔群众损失，并厚葬死者。（丙冒、建忠、丙让、周波）
