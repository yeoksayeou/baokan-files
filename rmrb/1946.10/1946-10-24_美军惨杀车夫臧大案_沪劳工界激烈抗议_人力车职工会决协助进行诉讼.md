Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st -- Shanghai Dispatch: Labor circles here are fiercely protesting the American military's heinous murder of Zang Da's two sons. The Rickshaw Workers' Union has stated its determination to assist with the lawsuit. Labor Association Director Zhu Xuefan, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Zhu Xiangyun, and others have all issued statements to the press, expressing their indignation and support. The American military authorities and the government authorities attempted to threaten and bribe Zang's younger brother, Zang Chenghai, to settle the Zang case privately, but he firmly refused, saying: "I have been a cleaner for sixteen years and have already been poor my whole life. I will never think of getting rich off the dead. Justice must be served!" More than forty rickshaw pullers complained to the press that American soldiers often do not pay or underpay fares, and even beat them up or drag them into police stations for detention. Many rickshaw pullers are beaten for not knowing the locations of secret prostitution dens. American soldiers driving "Jeeps" who charge around on the roads often jump out of their vehicles and brutally beat them without reason, and do not allow them to argue.

Furthermore: As of the 6th, the Zang Case Support Association's fundraising drive for Zang had received over 670,000 yuan within one week, via the Wenhui Daily. The majority of donors were workers from various industries, including unemployed and impoverished workers.

　　美军惨杀车夫臧大案
    沪劳工界激烈抗议
    人力车职工会决协助进行诉讼
    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪汛：此间劳工界激烈抗议美国惨杀臧大二子案，人力车职业工会表示决协助进行诉讼，劳协理事朱学范、市总工会理事长朱祥云等均一致向报界发表谈话，表示愤慨与声援。美军当局与政府当局想要威胁利诱臧之弟臧成海，要将臧案私下了结，他坚予拒绝说：“我做了十六年清道夫，已经贫苦一世，决不在死人身上转发财念头。冤是一定要伸的！四十多个人力车夫向报界控诉说：美兵常不付或少付车资，甚至反而将他们痛打一顿，或拖入警局坐禁闭。好多车夫因不知道秘密卖淫的地方而至挨打。在马路上横冲直闯的驾“吉普”美兵，常从车上跳下横蛮无理的痛打他们，并不准抗辩。
    又：臧案支援会发起之援臧募捐，截至六日止，一周间，文汇报已代收到六十七万余元，捐献者大多数为各业工人，且有失业困苦之工人。
