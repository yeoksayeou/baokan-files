[Our Newspaper, Lingchuan News] After the mass emancipation movement in Yetou Village, this county, most of the land issues have been resolved. The cadres were also very active and responsible during the movement, but unfair distribution of the fruits of labor led to dissatisfaction among the masses, resulting in low attendance at Farmers' Association meetings. The masses said, "The emancipation benefited the cadres." While the cadres retorted, "No one sees how much work the cadres have been delayed." A divide formed between the cadres and the masses, greatly hindering the in-depth progress of the movement. The leadership, upon discovering this situation, decided to reform the cadres' work style: on one hand, cadres were organized into groups for self-reflection and "face-washing"; on the other hand, Farmers' Association members and the masses were encouraged to speak freely and give the cadres their opinions. The masses raised more than fifty issues, including selfishness, corruption, favoritism, and unfair distribution of the fruits of labor among the cadres. Because cadres have always lacked democratic living habits, they were initially more dissatisfied with the masses when they saw them giving opinions. The leadership pointed out: the cadres are basically good and have made contributions to the movement, but they should wash their faces and correct their shortcomings; after the shortcomings are corrected, the masses and superiors will trust them even more. After further discussion, the cadres cleared their minds and became happy. Ou Hubao said, "The masses should have brought this up earlier so I could have known and corrected it sooner!" The chairman of the Farmers' Association said, "In the past, the accounts of the fruits of labor were unclear, and there was no bottom line, so no wonder the masses had opinions." Six cadres voluntarily returned seventeen mu of good land to the masses. Hubao even wanted to return six houses, but the masses said, "Forget it, you have many brothers, it's not enough to live in!" Seeing that the cadres had accepted their opinions and changed, the masses said, "They helped the Eighth Route Army when the Japanese were here and led us to emancipation. Let them continue to do it, as long as they correct their work style!" Seeing that the masses did not dwell on the past, the cadres were deeply moved and said, "We must continue to wash our faces in the Farmers' Association." The village's Farmers' Association membership has now surged from the original one hundred and sixteen to two hundred and forty-six, and a further movement is brewing.

　　冶头村干部经自我检讨
    退出多分果实给群众
    干部群众间益趋亲密团结
    农会会员倍增酝酿新斗争
    【本报陵川讯】本县冶头村经过群众翻身运动，已解决了大部土地问题，干部在运动中也很积极负责，但因果实分配不公，引起群众不满，致农会开会时会员多不到会。群众说：“翻身是干部翻身了。”而干部却说：“干部误了多少工就没人看见”。干部群众形成对立，深入运动受了很大阻碍，领导上发现这种情况，决定改造干部作风：一面将干部组成小组进行反省洗脸，一面发动农会会员和群众本知无不言，言无不尽精神给干部提意见。群众提出了干部自私、贪污、包庇及分配果实不公等问题五十余件。干部因一向缺乏民主生活习惯，最初看见群众纷纷给自己提意见，更加对群众不满，领导上乃向大家指出：干部基本上是好的，在运动中有功劳，但有缺点应该洗脸改正，缺点改正后，群众和上级会更加相信。干部又经过讨论，思想打通了。都高兴起来，欧虎保说：“群众该早提，我早知道早改好啦！”农会主席说：“过去果实账目不清楚，也没有个底，怨不得群众提意见。”六个干部自动给群众退出好地十七亩，虎保还要退出六间房子，群众说：“算了吧，你弟兄们多，不够住！”群众见干部接受意见转变了，都说：“日本在时他们就帮助八路军有过功劳，又领导咱们翻身，还是叫他们干吧，只要改正作风就好了！”干部见群众不究既往，深为感动，都说：“还得在农会继续洗脸。”现该村农会会员已由原有一百一十六人激增至二百四十六人，正酝酿进一步的运动。                      （武艾巍）
