　　Fengzhen: The Tomb of Fu Zuoyi
　　Yuan Bai
　　The Fu puppet troops who occupied Fengzhen were cavalry commanded by Sun Lanfeng, a chaotic force composed of puppet soldiers, bandits, traitors, and secret agents. In the past, they had been pillaging and slaughtering along the Ping-Sui Railway line, committing all kinds of evils. When they appeared on the streets of Fengzhen with American automatic rifles, the entire city was shrouded in an atmosphere of gloomy silence. Fengzhen had already become a ghost town when the Fu puppet troops arrived. Not a single table, chair, or bench could be found in the railway station, barracks, county government offices, or other public institutions and residences. The electrical wires had been taken away, the poles cut down, there was no grain in the warehouses, and not a single item of merchandise could be found in the shops. All usable materials had been thoroughly hidden by the masses. In order to suppress the people's silent resistance, the villains frantically arrested and killed people. In the first batch, more than ten city residents were seized. At a desolate mass meeting, three innocent old people were executed, and seven young men from Li Si Gou and Chen Qi Dan villages in the west of the city were buried alive. Former traitors and local bullies such as Hu Zhanliang, Liu Jian, and Xue Fengyi, along with Lei Shitong, the former head of the Japanese-controlled Industrial and Technological Association, strutted about, knocking on doors in the east and looting houses in the west. The cries of the city's women could be heard from time to time. The Fu puppet troops confiscated the remaining homespun cloth in private businesses, claiming it was "Eighth Route Army supplies," and swept away the small amount of flour, meat, and food that the citizens had left. Sun Lanfeng even forced all businesses to open, but very few did so, and even the theater stopped performing. The common people privately discussed: "When the Eighth Route Army was here, Fengzhen was lively and prosperous, but now it has become the tomb of Fu Zuoyi." Every citizen held a firm belief: "The Eighth Route Army will be back soon." They witnessed firsthand the panic and embarrassment of the Fu puppet troops. Because the Fu officers and soldiers feared being annihilated by the Eighth Route Army, they did not take off their clothes at night, and the horses were not unsaddled. One night, a grenade suddenly exploded with a loud bang. The Fu troops were thrown into confusion, and even the headquarters of Commander Sun Lanfeng, located in the Earth Temple in the city, hurriedly retreated north. Later, it was discovered that it was a grenade that had gone off by accident from a Fu puppet soldier on sentry duty.

　　丰镇  傅作义的坟墓
    元白
    侵占丰镇的傅伪军，是孙兰峰指挥的骑兵，是由伪军土匪汉奸特务组成的一支乱七八糟的队伍，他们过去就在平绥线上各城镇掳掠屠杀无恶不作，当他们拿着美国自动步枪出现在丰镇街头时，全城笼罩着一片阴森死寂的空气。丰镇在傅伪军到来时早已变成了一座空城，在火车站、营盘、县政府等公共机关住宅，找不到一张桌椅板凳，电线被收走了，电杆砍断了，仓库里没有粮食，商店里找不到一点货物，一切可被利用的物资，都被群众坚壁一空。恶棍们为了镇压人民沉默的抗拒，疯狂的捕杀人民，在城内第一批捉了十多个市民。在一次冷落的群众大会上，三个无辜的老百姓被处死，城西刘家村李四狗、陈七旦等七个青年被活埋了。过去的汉奸恶霸胡占良、刘建、薛凤仪等败类，与前日寇工学组合负责人雷世通，趾高气扬的东家扣门，西街劫舍，全城妇女哀嚎惨声时有所闻，傅伪军把私人商号中残存的土布称是“八路军物资”，加以没收，将市民仅存的麦粉、肉类、食粮等扫劫一空。孙兰峰更强令各商号营业，但开门者寥寥无几，连剧院也停演了。老百姓私下议论说：“八路军在时，热闹红火的丰镇，现在变成傅作义的坟墓了。”每个市民都抱着一个坚强的信念：“八路军很快就要打回来的。”他们亲眼看到傅伪军的恐慌狼狈情形。傅军官兵因恐八路军聚歼，晚上人不脱衣，马不下鞍。一个夜里，轰然一声手榴弹突然爆炸了，傅军张惶失措，住在城内土堂子的孙兰峰司令部也匆匆北撤，后来才发觉是傅伪军哨兵的手榴弹走了火。
