　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th (Delayed Dispatch): Recently, the 315th Regiment of the 105th Brigade of the 49th Division (original army) of the Chiang troops, which was transferred from Rugao to Huangqiao (Note: Huangqiao was re-occupied by the Chiang troops on September 19), dispatched two companies to Fenjie (20 li northeast of Huangqiao) on the 13th. The local people's armed forces attacked them. One company of the Chiang troops was completely wiped out in Xiguanzhuang, eight li east of Huangqiao, and another company was also defeated. In this battle, more than 100 Chiang troops were killed or captured, and seven 60mm light machine guns, five Canadian portable machine guns, two grenade launchers, and twenty-seven rifles and carbines were seized. The Chiang troops were very panicked by this blow and withdrew the small garrisons stationed at Hetouzhuang, Shijiabao, Yaojiadai, and other places on the Tai (xing) Huang (qiao) highway to Huangqiao and Taixing. On the evening of the 5th of this month, a unit of the New Fourth Army, in coordination with the militia, counterattacked the Chiang Kai-shek's "Armed Homecoming Corps" that harassed from Donghai, and recovered 49 villages, capturing 20 Chiang soldiers and killing or wounding 6. On the 10th, a unit of the New Fourth Army, in coordination with the local armed forces, launched a night attack on the Chiang Kai-shek stronghold in Dongheshangchang, Zaohe Town (40 li northwest of Suqian), capturing more than 10 Chiang soldiers and seizing more than 20 rifles.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th (Delayed News): A certain unit of the Suzhong New Fourth Army launched a counterattack on the Chiang troops occupying the Grand Canal line on the 15th, and recovered the important town of Fanshui (between Gaoyou and Baoying), which was occupied by the Chiang troops in a north-south pincer movement three days ago (on the 12th). After a whole night of fighting, most of the Chiang troops of the 120th Regiment of the 40th Brigade of the 25th Division (original army) and the "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in the area were annihilated.
