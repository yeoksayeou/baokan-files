　　Warning!
    Armed Secret Agents Harass Wharf, Besiege Militia, but are Repelled by Us
    [This newspaper report] On the evening of the 16th of this month, dozens of armed secret agents of Chiang Kai-shek, who had sneaked into Matou Town, Cixian County, suddenly surrounded the local militia's residence, wounding three people including the militia captain. They then rushed straight to the residence of the Turn-Over Team and forced the militia to shout for the Turn-Over Team to hand over their guns. The Turn-Over Team calmly fought back and finally defeated the gang of secret agents. This matter should arouse the vigilance of all our Party, government, military, civilians, and militia, strengthen joint defense, strengthen sentry posts, and strictly check pedestrians to prevent secret agents from infiltrating.

    武装特务袭扰码头包围民兵被我击退
    【本报讯】本月十六日晚十时潜入我磁县马头镇蒋记武装特务数十名，突然包围该地民兵住舍，击伤民兵队长等三名，继向翻身队住舍直扑，并强迫民兵喊翻身队缴枪，翻身队沉着应战，终将该股特务击溃。此事应引起我党政军民兵全体警惕，加强联防，加强岗哨，严查行人，以防特务混入。
