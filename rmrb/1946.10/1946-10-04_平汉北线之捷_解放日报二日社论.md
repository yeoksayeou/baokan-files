Victory on the Pinghan Northern Line
*Liberation Daily* Editorial, 2nd

The Eighth Route Army on the Pinghan Front launched a self-defensive counterattack on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway at 10 PM on the 29th, just nineteen hours after Chiang Kai-shek issued the order for a general offensive on Zhangjiakou. They recovered more than ten towns and stations including Wangdu and Xushui, controlled 250 *li* of the Pinghan Railway, and annihilated more than 2,500 Chiang and puppet troops, dealing a heavy blow to the Chiang army's offensive system in North China. This is another great victory following the Longhai and Datong-Puzhou (Tongpu) campaigns. This victory has greatly inspired the soldiers and civilians on the self-defense front in various regions, especially the self-defense soldiers and civilians on the Ping-Sui line.

This victory once again proves that the contradiction between Chiang Kai-shek's ambitious strategic intentions and his extremely insufficient troop strength is insurmountable. Just as Chiang Kai-shek is sticking his head out to invade Zhangjiakou, his rear is exposed to attack. This victory once again proves that in the war of aggression against the Liberated Areas, Chiang Kai-shek is not only unable to occupy a vast area, but the points and lines he has occupied are also isolated and unstable. These points and lines are surrounded by the vast army and people of the Liberated Areas, and are subject to attack at any time. The larger the scope of the Chiang army's invasion, the longer its lines of communication become, and the more dispersed the defensive forces at points and lines become. The more opportunities for the army and people of the Liberated Areas to carry out annihilation strikes. When the Chiang army advances in a big way, it is not only blocked in front and on the flanks, but also in its rear, on its lines of communication, and in its weakly defended areas, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and local forces can launch sudden counterattacks at any time, catching it off guard, opening up new battlefields, and coordinating with frontal operations. This puts the Chiang army in a passive situation of being unable to attend to everything at once. Whether in the front or the rear, the Chiang army will continue to lose its effective strength, while the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army will, on the contrary, continue to increase their effective strength. The attack on the Pinghan Railway vividly demonstrates this process, but the victory on the Pinghan Northern Line is only a beginning.

Chiang Kai-shek dreams of opening up seven railways before Double Ten Day. According to a dispatch from the United Press in Nanjing on the 30th, "Nationalist sources believe that all battles will cease by October 10, at which time the government's war to clear the Communist army from the railways can be declared completed." However, objective facts are contrary to Chiang Kai-shek's subjective wishes. Double Ten Day is only a week away, and not only has not a single railway been opened, but the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, which has been under control for quite some time, has been cut off again.

The victory on the Pinghan Northern Line shows that Chiang Kai-shek's plan will never work. At present, Chiang Kai-shek and the US side are spreading "peace" rhetoric, attempting to seize the opportunity to replenish and reorganize when Chiang's civil war actions have encountered numerous difficulties, in order to more frantically invade the Liberated Areas. This conspiracy will also not work. The Liberated Areas and the people of the whole country yearn for peace, but only if Chiang Kai-shek immediately ceases his attacks on the Liberated Areas and withdraws from the areas he has occupied since the beginning of the year, can there be true peace. Otherwise, the just self-defense of the army and people of the Liberated Areas will never cease.

### 平汉北线之捷  解放日报二日社论

　　平汉北线之捷
    解放日报二日社论
    平汉前线八路军，于二十九日晚十时即蒋介石下总攻击张家口命令以后的十九小时，向平汉路北段举行自卫出击，收复望都、徐水等十余城镇车站，控制平汉铁路二百五十里，歼灭蒋伪军二千五百余人，给予华北蒋军的进攻体系以沈重一击，这是继陇海、同蒲战役后又一次的大胜利。这一胜利给各地自卫战线上的军民，特别是平绥线上的自卫军民以极大的鼓舞。
    这次胜利再次证明：蒋介石战略意图庞大与兵力非常不足的矛盾是无法克服的；正当蒋介石伸着头进犯张家口的时候，他的屁股只好亮着挨打。这次胜利再次证明：蒋介石在进攻解放区的战争中，不仅无法占领广大的面，而且他所侵占的点和线也是孤立和不稳固的；这些点和线处于解放区广大军民的包围之中，时时刻刻有被袭击之可能。蒋军的进犯范围愈大，它的交通线愈加延长，点线的守备力量亦愈分散，解放区军民进行歼灭性的打击的机会也就愈多。当蒋军大举前进的时候，他不仅在前面和侧面遭到阻击，而且在他的后方，在他的交通线上，在他的守备薄弱的地方，随时可以出现八路军新四军和地方兵团的突然反击，打他一个措手不及，开辟新的战场，配合正面作战。这样使蒋军处于顾此失彼的被动境地，不管在前方或后方，蒋军都要不断地损失有生力量，而八路军新四军则相反地不断增长有生力量。平汉路的出击，正生动的表现了这样过程，可是平汉北线之捷还仅仅是一个开端。
    蒋介石梦想在双十节以前打通七条铁路，据合众社南京三十日电报导：“国民党各方面的表示，相信一切战事至十月十日即将停止，届时政府自铁路肃清中共军之战可告完成。”可是客观事实却偏偏和蒋介石的主观愿望作对，双十节距今只一星期了，不但一条铁路也未打通，而且已控制颇久的平汉北段却又被打断。
    平汉北段之捷，说明蒋介石的计划是永远行不通的。目前蒋介石和美方正在散布“和平”空气，企图在蒋之内战行动已遇到重重困难之时取得补充休整的机会，以便更疯狂地进犯解放区，这种阴谋亦是行不通的。解放区和全国人民渴望和平，但是只有蒋介石立即停止对解放区的进攻，并撤出年初以来侵占的地区，才有真正的和平之可言，否则解放区军民的正义自卫决不会中止。
