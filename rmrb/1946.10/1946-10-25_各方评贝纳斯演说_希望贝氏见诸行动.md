Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd -- Reports from various sources: After Byrnes delivered his radio address, the French newspaper "l'Humanité" said that Byrnes' speech was "a plagiarism of Wallace." The newspaper's headline was "On the Eve of the American Elections, Byrnes Seems to Have Become a Realist." The French newspaper "Libération" praised Byrnes' frank expression of his stance toward the Soviet Union, but pointed out: "If it is not translated into action, Byrnes' gesture is worthless in the eyes of the Kremlin." U.S. Democratic Senator Pepper agreed with the policy of friendship with the Soviet Union, hoping that Byrnes' speech would lead to the best understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said that he hoped Byrnes would pay attention to the American people's desire to implement a policy of just neighborliness and world peace.

　　各方评贝纳斯演说
    希望贝氏见诸行动
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据各方讯：贝纳斯发表广播演说后，法国“人道报”说贝氏演说是“抄袭了华莱士”。该报的标题为“在美国选举的前夜，贝纳斯似乎变成现实主义的了”。法国“解放报”称许贝纳斯对苏立场的坦白表示，但指出：“假如不见诸行动的话，贝纳斯此一姿态在克里姆林宫的眼中，是毫无价值的”。美民主党参议员泼贝尔赞成对苏友谊政策，希望贝纳斯的演说使美苏间有最好的谅解。前商务部长华莱士称：他希望贝纳斯注意美国人民要求实行正义睦邻与世界和平政策之愿望。
