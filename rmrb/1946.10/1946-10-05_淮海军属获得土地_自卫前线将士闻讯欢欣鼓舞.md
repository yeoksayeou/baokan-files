　　Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 2nd: The families of the Huaihai Sea Army soldiers have universally obtained land, giving a great boost to the morale of the soldiers guarding the self-defense front. During the land reform movement, 80% of the officers and soldiers of the 1st Battalion of a certain regiment received letters from home, informing them that their parents and wives had completely turned over and obtained enough land to live on. Ma Junzhang, a machine gun squad leader from a poor peasant background, received a letter from home, and his comrades eagerly passed it around, discussing the good news that Old Ma's family had received three mu of paddy fields, seven mu of sorghum, and five mu of soybeans. Wang Yuanxing, the Quartermaster of a certain battalion, whose family received two mu of sorghum, two mu of rice, and ten mu of irrigated land, said happily, "Since I joined the army in 1941, I have always been worried about my family's livelihood. Now I have no more worries, and I can wholeheartedly defend my hometown."
