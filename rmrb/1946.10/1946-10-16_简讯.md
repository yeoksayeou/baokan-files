　　Brief News

　　The Changzhi City Hengsheng Sundries Store, correctly implementing the government's trade policy, has seen its business flourish, earning a net profit of 600,000 yuan in the past three months. This store is a joint venture with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. Since the end of June, it has specialized in transporting and selling essential goods such as homespun cloth, cotton, and salt, supporting small merchants and peddlers, and implementing the policy of promoting local products and serving the masses. Internally, the store implements a democratic leadership style, adopts a wage system, and improves employee benefits. The manager's monthly salary is 225 jin of millet, while accountants, salespeople, and apprentices have their wages determined based on their business ability, with the highest being 190 jin of millet and the lowest being 70 jin. As a result, employees are united and highly enthusiastic, and the business is thriving. Since the city's merchants launched a study movement, the store has established a study system, and Manager Dong enthusiastically encourages his colleagues to study. Currently, they study current affairs and business every morning.

　　In the Qin, Bo, Wu, and Xiu areas of the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang, excessive autumn rains have led to the prevalence of seasonal diseases (mostly malaria, typhoid fever, and relapsing fever). In Qinyang's Second District, patients account for over 27% of the entire district. In Encun District, 1,800 villagers are ill in ten administrative villages, accounting for 15% of the population. In Zaodi and Fuchengdian, each village has 40 to 50 patients, which not only affects the autumn harvest and autumn planting but also hinders the progress of the mass emancipation movement. The Jiaozuo City Government has specially allocated a large sum of money from the social welfare and public health funds to purchase medicines and organize mobile medical teams to go to the countryside to diagnose and treat the masses. The team is divided into four groups, each equipped with one Western doctor and two traditional Chinese medicine doctors. They have already set off in recent days and will waive all handling fees. Poor farmers and families of military cadres will also be exempt from medicine fees, and ordinary people will only be charged half price. (Xiao Shan)
