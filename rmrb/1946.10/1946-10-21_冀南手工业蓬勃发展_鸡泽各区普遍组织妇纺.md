　　Flourishing Handicraft Industry in Southern Hebei
    Jize District Organizes Women's Textile Production Universally
    [Reported from Weixian on the 19th by our newspaper] The handicraft industry in southern Hebei is flourishing. The Jize Mass Cooperative has provided loans for cotton and organized 578 textile groups in 73 villages, with 2,854 women participating in textile production. In half a month, they have woven 1,294 feet of cloth, earning a net profit of 5,176 jin of cotton. Based on the current price of cloth, this can be converted into over 1.55 million yuan, which can be exchanged for 345.7 shi of grain, enough to feed 150 people for a whole year. The masses are very happy, saying, "The Mass Cooperative asks us to buy shares, not only can we share dividends, but it also allows us to earn money from weaving, it's really good!" Currently, the entire county is universally establishing textile groups and small cooperatives. The towel industry in Xujiazhuang, Weixian County, has received government loans, solving the problems of raw materials and sales, and production has rapidly expanded. Currently, the entire village with 320 households has 212 looms, and there are still more than 20 carpenters in the village rushing to make looms. Currently, the entire village can weave over 400 dozens per day, with a net profit of 400 yuan per dozen, earning over 160,000 yuan per day, enabling every household to have sufficient food and clothing. Not only that, the towel weaving handicraft industry in the village has also absorbed spinners from villages within a dozen li around them to spin yarn for them, organizing the production of the masses in that area. In the small iron factory in Xiaohuzhuan Village, Second District, although there are only more than 20 craftsmen, the production tools they manufacture for farmers are quite considerable, producing over 10,000 textile spindles, 250 manure rakes, 900 iron muzzles, 500 hoes, 600 mud boards, and over 2,000 pieces of various farm tools annually.

　　冀南手工业蓬勃发展
    鸡泽各区普遍组织妇纺
    【本报威县十九日电】冀南手工业生产蓬勃发展。鸡泽大众合作社贷款贷棉并组织七十三个村成立起五百七十八个纺织组，参加妇女两千八百五十四人，从事纺织，半月间即织布一千二百九十四尺，共赚净棉五千一百七十六斤。如以目前布价计，可折款一百五十五万余元，可换细粮三百四十五石七升，可供一百五十人全年食用。群众都很高兴的舆论着：“大众合作社叫咱入股，不但可以分红，还叫咱纺织赚钱，真好！”目下全县正普遍建立纺织组与小型合作社。威县徐家庄的毛巾业获得政府贷款，解决了原料、销货问题，生产已迅速扩大，现全村三百二十户有机子二百十二架，尚有二十多个木匠正在该村赶制机子。现全村每天能织四百余打，每打纯利四百元，每日可赚十六万余元；可做到家家丰衣足食。不仅如此，该村的织毛巾手工业还吸收了周围十几里内村庄的纺妇给他们纺线，组织了那一带群众的生产。二区小胡转村之小型铁工厂内，虽然只有二十多个工匠，但为农民制造出的生产工俱却很可观，年出纺织锭子万余根，粪耙子二百五十个，铁笼头九百个，锄头五百个，泥板六百个，及各种农俱二千余件。
