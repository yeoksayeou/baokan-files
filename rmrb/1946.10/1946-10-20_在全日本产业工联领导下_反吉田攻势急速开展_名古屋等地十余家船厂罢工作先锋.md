　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Tokyo Dispatch: The ten-day offensive against the Yoshida Cabinet, led by the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, is rapidly unfolding. More than ten shipyards affiliated with the All-Japan Machine Workers' Union in Shinagawa, Nagoya, and other places have launched strikes, acting as the vanguard of the offensive. More than a thousand coal miners in Yamaguchi Prefecture have launched a responsive strike. Yoshida is utilizing the right wing of the Socialist Party to carry out sabotage within the Federation of Industrial Unions. The chairman of the Federation, Kikunami, issued a statement on the 14th, warning the right-wing Socialist Party saboteurs that if they continue to act as Yoshida's lackeys, they will be expelled from membership. This is because, during the meeting of the Supreme Military Committee of the Federation on that day, the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party repeatedly prevented the issuance of a general strike order.

    【新华社延安十六日电】东京讯：全日本产业工会联合会领导下的反吉田内阁十日攻势，正急速展开，全日本机器工会所属新＠、名古屋等十余家造船厂已发动罢工，作为攻势的先锋。山口县千余煤矿工人，已发动响应罢工。吉田正利用社会党右派在产业工会联合会中进行破坏工作。该会主席菊波于十四日发表谈话，警告社会党右派破坏分子，如仍继续充当吉田走狗，即将开除其会籍。因当天该会最高军事委员会开会时，社会党右派领袖一再阻止发布总罢工命令。
