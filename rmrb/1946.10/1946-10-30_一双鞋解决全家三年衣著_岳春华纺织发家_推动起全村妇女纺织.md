    Yue Chunhua Becomes Wealthy Through Textile Production
    Promoting Weaving Among Women in the Entire Village
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Yue Chunhua, a textile hero from Qiushuyuan Village in the Third District of this county, used one pair of shoes as capital, solving her family's clothing needs for three years and promoting weaving among women throughout the village. In the winter of 1943, Yue Chunhua sold a pair of shoes for 200 silver dollars, bought four catties of cotton, and wove 28 feet of cloth. In the first month of 1944, she sold the cloth for 700 silver dollars and bought 9.5 catties of cotton. Afterwards, she continued to spin and weave, continuously exchanging for cotton. After a year, besides using 6.6 zhang of cloth for clothing for her family of three, she still had 16 catties of cotton left. In 1945, she used this cotton as capital and continued to spin and weave. Until October of this year, besides using 18 zhang of cloth for clothing, she still had 6 catties of cotton and 16 zhang of cloth left, and earned an additional 5,000 silver dollars. For the past three years, Yue Chunhua has relied on textile production to solve many difficulties for her family, significantly improving her life. This year, all 58 women in the village, influenced and encouraged by her, have participated in textile production. There are now 50 spinning wheels and 15 looms, with 35 skilled workers and 23 semi-skilled workers. In the past ten months, they have spun 462 catties of cotton and woven 3,234 feet of cloth. Besides the clothing consumption of the entire village, they have also sold 400 feet of cloth, worth over 60,000 silver dollars. They have also woven 570 catties of cloth for other villages, earning 39,900 silver dollars in wages. (Dai Yun)
