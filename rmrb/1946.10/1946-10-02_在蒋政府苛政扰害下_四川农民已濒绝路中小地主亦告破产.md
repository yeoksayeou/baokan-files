　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Chongqing News: Sichuan farmers, under the harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's government's heavy taxes and natural disasters, are on the brink of ruin. More than 90 counties reported disasters in early July, and the 40-odd counties that suffered floods in the autumn are not included. As a result, Sichuan's harvest this year has been greatly damaged. Some counties lack as much as 70% of their grain. What makes farmers even more miserable is that the Chiang Kai-shek government's requisition of real goods and miscellaneous taxes have increased rather than decreased. During the War of Resistance, Sichuan had already been requisitioned 90 million shi of land tax in kind and requisitioned and borrowed. This year, another 13 million shi of grain will be requisitioned. According to the "Sichuan Economic Quarterly," there are as many as 240 kinds of miscellaneous taxes. The "Victory Public Bonds," "Township Public Welfare Savings," "Air Defense Donations," "City Dingle Fees," "Grain Storage Payments in Lieu," "Subsidies for Food and Rice for Baojia Chiefs," "National Soldiers Training Fees," "Bandit Suppression Equipment and Ammunition Fees," and firewood for the army passing through, etc., are generally levied in various places. The financial department's regulations on tax collection and the names of the Baojia chiefs who apportion it at any time are not included. The Baojia chiefs are the "local emperors" of one township and one Bao. They arbitrarily kill people, arrest draftees, or apportion donations and taxes. A folk song in northern Sichuan says: "When bandits come, they are like combing with a comb; when soldiers come, they are like combing with a fine-toothed comb; the Baojia masters shave with a razor." Conscription and miscellaneous taxes not only make farmers unable to prevent disasters, but also make farmers more vulnerable to hunger and death. For example, in Yibin County, which is known for its prosperity, 97% of the farmers in more than 20 towns are poorly clothed, and many young girls are unable to cover their shame due to tattered clothes; even small and medium-sized landlords feel that life is difficult. A landlord who manages mountains wrote to the "Southwest Daily" saying that his family of six had an annual rent of more than 60 shi. Before the war, life was prosperous and he never knew what worries were, but now prices have soared and he is in debt every year. This year, the mountains are severely dry and the harvest is less than 30%. In addition, the requisition of real goods will begin again, and there is no way to borrow money. He had no choice but to declare bankruptcy.

　　在蒋政府苛政扰害下
    四川农民已濒绝路中小地主亦告破产
    【新华社延安二十九日电】渝讯：四川农民在蒋介石政府苛捐及灾荒等扰害下，生活已濒绝路，在七月初先后报灾的竟达九十多县，而秋来遭受水灾的四十多县还不在内。因此今年川省收成大受损害，有些县份粮食缺乏达十分之七，更使农苦的就是蒋介石政府的征实和苛杂的有增无已。四川在抗战中已被征了九千万石的田赋征实与征借，今年又要征收一千三百万石粮食。各种苛捐杂税，据“四川经济季刊”的数字，名目已有二百四十种之多，普遍在各地征收的有“胜利公债”、“乡镇公益储蓄”、“防空捐”、“城丁费”、“积谷代金”、“保甲长食米津贴”、“国民兵训练费”、“剿匪械弹费”，以及军队过境的马干柴草等等，而财部规定税收及保甲长随时摊派的名目尚不在内。保甲长都是一乡一保的“土皇帝”，他们任意杀人抓丁或摊派捐税款项，川北民谣说：“匪来如同梳子梳，兵来就是篦子篦，保甲老爷剃刀剃”。抓丁与苛杂不仅使农民无力防灾，而且使农民更陷于饥饿与死亡。例如素称富庶的宜宾县，二十多镇农民百分之九十七衣不蔽体，许多大姑娘衣服破烂不能遮羞；甚至中小地主也感生活困苦。一位管山的地主写信给《西南日报》说，他一家大小六口年收租六十多石，战前生活优裕，从不知什么忧思，可是现在物价高涨，年年负债，今年各山大旱，收成不及百分之三十。再加征实又将开始，告贷无门，他只好宣告破产了。
