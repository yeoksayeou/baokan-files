Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party received Mr. Steele, a correspondent from the New York Herald Tribune in China, on the 29th of last month, and answered the questions raised by Mr. Steele as follows:

    Question: Does Your Excellency believe that the U.S. mediation of the Chinese civil war has failed? If U.S. policy continues in its current form, what will be the outcome?

    Answer: I highly doubt that the U.S. government's policy is so-called mediation. Based on the fact that the United States has provided massive assistance to Chiang Kai-shek, enabling him to launch an unprecedented large-scale civil war, it seems that the U.S. government's policy is to use so-called "mediation" as a cover to strengthen Chiang Kai-shek in all aspects and, through Chiang Kai-shek's policy of slaughter, to oppress China's democratic forces, so that China will actually become a U.S. colony. If this policy continues, it will inevitably arouse all patriotic people in China to rise up in resolute resistance.

    Question: How long will the Chinese civil war last? What will be the result?

    Answer: If the U.S. government abandons its current policy of unilateral support for Chiang, withdraws U.S. troops stationed in China, and implements the Moscow Three-Power Agreement, then the Chinese civil war can be ended sooner. If not, there is a possibility of it becoming a protracted war. As a result, on the one hand, the Chinese people will certainly suffer; but on the other hand, the Chinese people will certainly unite to defend their own survival and decide their own destiny. No matter how difficult and arduous it may be, the task of China's independence, peace, and democracy must be realized. No domestic or foreign oppressive force can prevent the realization of this task.

    Question: Does Your Excellency recognize Chiang Kai-shek as the "natural leader" of the Chinese people? Will the Communist Party not accept Chiang Kai-shek's five demands under any circumstances? If the Kuomintang attempts to convene a National Assembly without the participation of the

　　毛主席答美国记者
    美国假借调解助蒋内战
    全国人民必将坚决反抗
    【新华社延安五日电】上月二十九日，中共毛泽东主席接见纽约先驱论坛报驻华记者斯蒂尔先生，答复斯蒂尔先生所提出之问题如下：
    问：阁下是否认为美国调解中国内战之举已告失败？如美国政策按目前形式继续实行，则结局将如何？
    答：我很怀疑美国政府的政策是所谓调解。根据美国大量援助蒋介石、使得他能够举行空前大规模内战的事实看来，美国政府的政策是在借所谓“调解”作掩护，以便从各方面加强蒋介石，并经过蒋介石的屠杀政策，压迫中国民主力量，使中国在实际上变为美国的殖民地。这一政策继续实行下去，必将激起全中国一切爱国人民起来作坚决的反抗。
    问：中国内战将延长多久？其结果将如何？
    答：如果美国政府放弃现行片面援蒋政策，撤退驻华美军，实行莫斯科三国协定，则中国内战必能早日结束。如果不是这样，就有变为长期战争的可能。其结果，一方面当然是中国人民受痛苦；但是另一方面，中国人民必将团结起来，保卫自己的生存，决定自己的命运，不管怎样艰难困苦，中国人民的独立和平民主的任务，是一定要实现的，任何本国与外国的压迫力量，不可能阻止这一任务的实现。
    问：阁下是否认蒋介石是中国人民的“当然领袖”？共产党是否将在任何情况之下均不接受蒋介石的五项要求？如果国民党企图召集一个无共产党参加的国民大会，则共产党将采何种行动？
    答：世界上无所谓“当然领袖”。蒋介石能按照今年一月间的停战协定及政治协商会议的共同决议处理中国政治、军事、经济等项问题，而不是按照所谓“五项”或十项违反上述那些协定的片面要求，那么我们是仍然愿意和他共事的。国民大会只应当按照政治协商会议的决议，由各党派共同负责去召集，否则我们将采取坚决反对的态度。
