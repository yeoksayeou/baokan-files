(Reported by our newspaper from Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 15th) During the border area's all-out self-defense war, outstanding battle support models such as County Chief Guo of Puyang County, Political Commissar Song of Kunwu County, and Councilor Zhu of Hua County have successively received commendations from the Fourth Military Sub-district Headquarters and won honorary certificates. Other heroic stretcher-bearer militia models who participated in the war have also received rewards and commendations. County Chief Guo of Puyang County personally led 800 stretchers to the front line, leading the masses to compete to carry the wounded; 380 stretchers in Kunwu County, under the personal leadership of Political Commissar Song of the county, braved enemy gunfire and fearlessly rescued the wounded. Some were injured by bombs, but still endured the pain to send the wounded to the rear; Councilor Zhu of Hua County disregarded danger and personally led stretchers to the front line to rescue the wounded, which was highly praised by the masses. In addition to issuing a circular of commendation, the Sub-district Headquarters also gave each person five catties of meat, one bag of foreign flour, two towels, and a commendation certificate as comfort. General battle support models received half a catty of meat and 20,000 yuan in bonuses each. At the battle support model conference held in the Fourth District of Juancheng on the 29th, 1,500 stretcher-bearer militia models including Yin Ziyu and Li Shangge were commended. After returning to the village, Yin Ziyu, a special model, immediately held a meeting with all the group leaders and above in the village with the chairman of the farmers' association and the village chief, determined to strive for model status again in the next participation in the war, and responded to the challenge competition from other villages. Everyone decided that in order to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's invasion as soon as possible, the whole village must be more united and wholeheartedly do a good job in battle support work; each mutual aid group should step up mutual production; and prevent the sabotage of special agents. After the meeting, the stretcher team actively repaired the stretchers, and on the third night, they set off again in the rain overnight, with extremely high morale.
