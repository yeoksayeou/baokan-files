　　Reasoning and Complaining Educated Opium Dealers
    Han Hong's Opium Addicts Were Reformed
    Organizing Transportation and Weaving Shifted to Labor Production
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng 22nd Dispatch] Han Hong Village in Qinyuan County has more than 270 households. They were deeply victimized by Yan Xishan's poisoning policy. Dozens of households were opium dealers and opium addicts. In recent years, the democratic government has strictly prohibited drugs and provided education in many ways, which has gradually reduced the number of drug addicts. However, some people still sell and smoke opium secretly. These people were fortunately reformed in this year's mass movement and all turned to various productions. During the rent reduction in the first month of the lunar year, five people, including opium addict Zhang Shoushan, requested to join the tenant farmers' emancipation group. The masses reflected, "The haystack is moved and collapsed, and the old cow cannot be fattened. Isn't the fruit they get going to be used to smoke opium!" Tenant farmer Yang Hou said, "If they don't change, then participating in the accounting will be a disgrace to the Farmers' Association." Forty to fifty tenant farmers agreed with his opinion: not to allow unreformed opium addicts to participate in the tenant farmers' group. On the second day of the second lunar month, village cadres Yang Ziquan and others held a forum for opium addicts and asked: What is the reason why the tenant farmers don't allow you to participate in the accounting? Song Fuxi said: "Isn't it because we smoke opium? Otherwise, who would dare not want us?" Then they asked: "Who harmed you into smoking opium?" Everyone said: "In the past, Yan Xishan sold Jiaji official opium in Qinyuan's Jiushengchang, which made us suffer so much! We all want to quit now!" Yang Ziquan said: "As long as you are willing to quit, I have a way!" After the meeting, the opium addicts brought food and established a drug rehabilitation center. Eleven opium-addicted women took turns cooking, and the opium dealers were also called to the drug rehabilitation center. When the opium addicts saw them, they complained. Fan Xinluan complained that the opium dealer Yang Guixin had pawned her bracelet. Yang Fuxi complained that the opium dealer Yang Yuanze had pawned his cabinet. They couldn't get the opium out in three to five days and became "old customers." Everyone spoke up, educating the opium dealers, and the two sides signed a contract: no smoking, no selling. Opium dealers Yang Manjin and others voluntarily handed over the existing opium and official drugs to the drug rehabilitation center, and donated more than 29,000 yuan to help opium addicts withdraw. The opium addicts also burned their own opium paraphernalia, and studied methods to withdraw, registered in four grades, and quit their addictions on a regular basis. By March, they had all quit opium, participated in the rent reduction movement, obtained land and turned to labor production. Du Sanze and other eighteen people first organized and dug two earthen cave dwellings for the factory, earning 210 jin of millet, which solved the difficulty of eating grain during spring plowing, and continued to complete spring plowing and weeding activities. Yang Xinchou, Yang Weixin and others organized a transportation team, collectively invested 25,000 yuan, trafficked salt, bought cloth, and collected hemp, earning more than 52,000 yuan in three months. In order to encourage their transformation, the village rewarded them with one jin of white flour each during the Dragon Boat Festival, and their enthusiasm for labor production became even greater. Yang Sizer was good at breeding livestock, so the village cadres borrowed 25,000 yuan from the bank to buy him a male donkey, which was set up in the village, and has now mated with twenty-three horses and donkeys, earning six stones and nine dou of grain. Ren Xiulan and other four people organized weaving, and opium addicts who could not weave also learned. The remaining five people, including Zhang Shoushan, were stonemasons and carpenters, and they also organized and found a living. Several people who used to sell opium also voluntarily participated in mutual aid groups, cooperatives, and transportation teams, and began to work hard to produce. From then on, the masses of Han Hong no longer looked down on them.

　　说理诉苦教育了烟贩
    韩洪烟民获得改造
    组织运输纺织转向劳动生产
    【本报阳城廿二日电】沁源韩洪村共有二百七十余户，被阎锡山毒化政策陷害甚深，烟贩和吸毒者有好几十户，近年来民主政府严厉禁毒多方教育，已逐渐减少，但还有人偷着卖，偷着吸，这些人在今年群众运动中已幸获改造，全部转向各种生产。正月减租时，烟民张寿山等五人要求参加佃户翻身组，群众就反映说：“草堆搬塌了，老牛也喂不肥，他们分得果实还不是拿去吸了大烟！”佃户杨候小说：“他们要不转变了就参加算账，算是给农会丢脸”。四五十个佃户都同意他的意见：不让未转变的烟民参加佃户组。阴历二月初二，村干部杨自全等召开烟民座谈会，提出：佃户不让你们参加算账究竟是什么原因？宋福喜说：“还不是因为咱吸大烟，要不，谁敢不要咱？”又问：“你们吸大烟是谁害的？”大家都说：“过去阎锡山在沁源九盛昌卖甲记官土，就把咱害苦了！咱们现在都愿戒掉！”杨自全说：“只要你们愿戒就行，我有办法！”会后，烟民们带了粮食成立了戒烟所。十一个烟民妇女轮流作饭，又将烟贩们叫到戒烟所，烟民一见他们就诉起苦来，樊新ｌｕǎｎ＠①诉说烟贩杨贵新押过他的手镯。杨福喜诉说烟贩杨元则押过他的柜子，都是三五天抽不出就“老号”了。你一言，我一语，教育了烟贩，就两下订立合同：不吸不卖。烟贩杨满金等自动将现存的大烟土和官药交给戒烟所，并捐出二万九千多元帮助烟民退瘾。烟民们也将自己的烟具烧毁，并研究退瘾办法，分四等登记起来，定期戒绝了瘾。到三月，他们的烟都戒掉了，参加减租运动，得到土地转向劳动生产。杜三则等十八人首先组织起来，给工厂打土窑洞两眼，赚得小米二百一十斤，解决了春耕中吃粮困难，继续完成了春耕与锄草活动。杨新丑、杨维心等组织了运输队，集体投资二万五千元，贩盐、买布、收麻，三个月赚了五万二千多元。为了鼓励他们的转变，过端午节时村上奖给他们每人一斤白面，他们劳动生产的劲就更大了。杨四则会配畜，村干部就向银行贷款二万五千元给他买了一个公驴，在村里安起槽来，直到现在已配了马驴二十三个，赚了六石九斗粮食。任秀兰等四人组织纺织，不会纺的烟民也都学会了。其余张寿山等五人是石匠木匠，也组织起来，找到了生活。过去卖烟的几个人也自动参加了互助组、合作社和运输队，开始努力生产。从此，韩洪的群众不再看不起他们了。
