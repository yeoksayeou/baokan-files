　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: United Press, Berlin, 4th: Germans here are very angry about the Nuremberg Tribunal's acquittal of Papen and others. 250,000 workers in the transportation and factory sectors went on strike today in protest. Automobiles, trams, and subways were halted for as long as one hour. Workers in at least twenty factory areas staged ten-minute symbolic strikes. Although these incidents were brief, they are sufficient to show that the political sentiments of the Germans are changing. Political rallies were held in some places last night to oppose the Nuremberg's lenient verdict, and there will be more rallies tonight. Berlin newspapers unanimously protested the Nuremberg's "lenient" verdict today. "Deutsche Volkszeitung," the organ of the Socialist Unity Party, published statements by the party's two leaders, Pieck and Grotewohl. Pieck said: This verdict is not the verdict of the German people; the German people will not only execute the war criminals, but also punish those who helped them seize power behind the scenes. Grotewohl said: The Germans can never accept the theory of "killing the small soldiers and letting the ringleaders go." "Berliner Zeitung," in its editorial, criticized the release of Nazi propagandist Fritz, saying: This is a "deeply regrettable mistake." The right-wing Free Democratic Party's organ expressed surprise at the lenient treatment of Dönitz (sentenced to ten years in prison) and astonishment at the release of Papen and others. Some newspapers reported that protest demonstrations were held in cities such as Dresden and Chemnitz.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Nuremberg dispatch: The German authorities here under the Allied military government issued an order on the 3rd to arrest Papen, Schacht, and Fritz, who were acquitted by the court. German plainclothes police, under the orders of Müller, the local inspector of the Denazification Bureau, surrounded the Nuremberg Palace, where the court was located, and arrested the three men when they left. Müller acted under the authority granted to him by the Allied Control Authority several months ago. It is claimed that all former Nazis should be sentenced to a minimum of ten years' imprisonment. Papen and the other two are still in Nuremberg Prison, and the US military authorities refuse to allow them to leave at this time. According to a Reuters reporter: "They are currently being held for their own safety. They will remain here as American guests until various arrangements for their departure have been completed."

　　柏林二十五万工人大罢工
    抗议释放巴本等战犯
    努城德当局下令重新逮捕
    【新华社延安四日电】合众社柏林四日电称：此间德人对努连堡法庭判决巴本等无罪事甚为愤怒。本日交通界及工厂工人廿五万人举行抗议罢工，汽车、电车及地下铁道，曾停顿达一小时之久，最少有二十处工厂区之工人作十分钟之象征罢工。此种事件历时虽短，然足可表示德人政治感觉已在转变。昨夜若干地方曾举行政治性集会，反对努连堡之宽大判决，今夜尚有若干集会。柏林各报今日一致抗议努连堡之“宽大”判决。统一社会党机关报“德意志新闻”刊载该党二位领袖皮克与格罗特莫赫之声明，皮克称：这一判决并不是德国人民的判决，德国人民将不仅处决战争罪犯，而且惩办在幕后帮助他们掌握政权的人。格罗特莫赫称：德国人绝不能接受“杀死小卒、放走人头”之理论。“柏林人日报”于其社论中，斥责纳粹宣传家弗烈兹之被释说：这是“深为遗憾的错误”。右翼自由民主党机关报对邓尼兹之宽大处理（按为十年徒刑）表示诧异，对巴本等之被释表示惊愕。若干报纸载称：德累斯登、彻姆尼兹等城均举行抗议示威。
    【新华社延安五日电】努连堡讯：此间盟国军政府下的德国当局，已于三日下令逮捕被法庭开释之巴本、沙赫特及弗烈兹，德国便衣警察奉消除纳粹局之地方检查长缪勒之命将法庭所在地之努连堡宫团团包围，俟此三人出门时逮捕之。缪勒系根据盟国管制当局于数月前所授予之权力行事。据称所有前纳粹分子，应受判处最低限度的十年徒刑，巴本等三人现仍在努连堡监狱内，美军当局拒绝允许他们现时离开该处。据路透社记者报导：“他们所以现仍被禁，是为了他们自身利益，在为他们离开之各种布置尚未备妥之前，他们是以美国客人身份而留此。”
