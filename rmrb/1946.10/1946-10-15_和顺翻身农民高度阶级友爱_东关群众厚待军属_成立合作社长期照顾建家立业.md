[This report from Changzhi, dated the 13th] In Harmony County, Dongguan, emancipated peasants, during the distribution of the fruits of struggle, demonstrated a high degree of class friendship by caring for the families of martyrs, military dependents, cadre dependents, and honorably discharged soldiers, thoroughly resolving their livelihood issues. Before the movement, the 44 military and cadre families and honorably discharged soldiers in the area possessed a total of 234.18 mu of flat slope land, averaging only 1.21 mu per person. Among them, 26 households were utterly impoverished, without a tile to their name or an inch of land. Now, each person averages 3.7 mu of land. Households with labor power have each obtained 4 mu of top-quality flat land and have risen to the level of middle peasants. Families with three members who are below the level of poor peasants have also been given 15,000 yuan (equivalent to half the price of a donkey), while single-person households have been given 7,500 yuan (enough for four families to jointly buy a donkey). The 32 households below the level of poor peasants have received a total of 298,050 yuan, six donkeys, and 171 good houses. In addition, a good mule, a new flour milling machine, and a complete grinding set were distributed to 40 military dependents to establish cooperatives to thoroughly resolve their livelihood difficulties. The cooperative's shareholding method is as follows: 1. Families of disabled, orphaned martyrs receive three shares, families of those who fought in the eight-year War of Resistance receive two shares, and families of new military and cadre members after liberation last year receive one share. 2. Three to five "difficulty shares" are allocated according to the degree of difficulty of the family, with those not in difficulty not receiving any, totaling 150 shares, with each share worth 1,000 yuan in foreign currency based on the total value of the cooperative. If there are continuing enlistments or retirements, shares will be added at any time. In order to provide long-term care for establishing families, withdrawal of shares is generally not allowed. Special care is given to disabled soldiers. For example, Li Jinshan's family of three received 3 mu of hemp land and 3 mu of flat land, in addition to 15,000 yuan to buy a donkey, plus an additional 2,000 yuan. Li Xiaoma also received 4 mu of flat land and 15,000 yuan, and housing is also specially provided. In addition, Hao Chengke and Li Guangmin, two families of resistance members who rely solely on agricultural production and have large populations, were given more than 20 mu of flat land, more than 21 mu of sloping land, 51 houses, and a donkey. Hao Chengke also called back his second son, who was working as a hired laborer elsewhere, and wrote to his son at the front, saying, "Our life is getting better, fight Chiang Kai-shek well at the front!"

　　和顺翻身农民高度阶级友爱
    东关群众厚待军属
    成立合作社长期照顾建家立业
    【本报长治十三日电】和顺东关翻身农民在分配斗争果实中，以高度阶级友爱精神照顾烈属、军属、干属及荣退军人，使他们的生活问题获得了彻底解决。该地四十四户军干家属及荣退军人，在运动前共有平坡地二百卅四亩一分八，每人仅平均一亩二分一。其中有廿六户是没有片瓦寸土的赤贫。现在每人平均已有三亩七分地。有劳力的户，每人都获得四亩特等好平地，已上升为中农。贫农以下的三口之家，并分给半个驴价一万五千元。一口之家给七千五百元（四家合买一驴）贫农以下的卅二户，共分得廿九万八千另五十元，六个驴，一百七十一间好房。此外，还把一头好骡子、一架新轧面机和一套全磨分给军属四十户，成立了合作社，以彻底解决他们的生活困难。合作社的顶股办法是：一、残废孤寡烈属顶三分，八年抗战的抗属顶二分，去年解放后的新军属干属顶一分。二、按家庭困难程度顶三至五个“困难分”，不困难的不顶，共一百五十分，按合作社总值，每分合洋一千元。如有继续参军或退伍者，随时添分。为了长期照顾建立家务，一般不允许抽股。对残废军人特别照顾。如李金山一家三口，分得麻地三亩，平地三亩，除一万五千元买驴洋外，还外加两千元。李小马也获得四亩平地与一万五千元，住房子也有特殊照顾。此外，单纯靠农业生产度日、人口多的抗属郝成科、李广民两家，即分得平地二十多亩，坡地二十一亩多，房五十一间，驴一个。郝成科把在外当长工的二儿子也叫了回来，并给前线的儿子写信说：“咱时光过好了，在前方好好打蒋介石吧！”
