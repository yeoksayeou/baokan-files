　　Supreme Soviet Presidium Session Concludes
    New Budget for the Year Approved

    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st】Moscow Dispatch: The second session of the Supreme Soviet Presidium of the Soviet Union concluded on the 18th. The session unanimously approved the new Soviet budget for 1946. The estimated revenue is 333.4 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 319.3 billion rubles. Compared with last year, the revenue increased by 31.4 billion rubles, and the expenditure increased by 20.7 billion rubles. The session also approved the appointment of Malenkov as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and relieved him of his duties as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. (Malenkov is one of the five secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and a member of the Politburo and the Organizational Bureau.) TASS's economic observer commented on the new budget for the year, stating: The first characteristic is that revenue exceeds expenditure, which proves the health of Soviet finance. Revenue does not rely on tax increases; on the contrary, tax revenue only accounts for 23.5 billion rubles, a decrease of over 13.33 billion rubles compared to last year. The second characteristic is that the expenditure on armed forces has been reduced by 56 billion rubles, and a large amount of funds has been used for peaceful construction. An estimated 102 billion rubles will be used for national economic construction. The third characteristic is that the expenditure on culture and social services has increased sharply, increasing by 32.7% compared to last year, totaling 83.25 billion rubles, half of which is used for education, 1.5 billion rubles for social healthcare and sports, and over 17 billion rubles for social public utilities. Another important characteristic is the growth of budgets for various nationalities and republics. The debates in the two chambers of the Soviet Parliament showed broad national support for this new national budget proposal.
