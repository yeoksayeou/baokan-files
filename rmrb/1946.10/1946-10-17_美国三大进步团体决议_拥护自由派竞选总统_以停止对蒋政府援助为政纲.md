　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Chicago dispatch: The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the National Citizens Political Action Committee (NCPAC), and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP) convened a political conference on September 30th. More than 300 representatives and liberals from all walks of life attended, including former Secretary of the Interior Ickes and former Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. The conference specifically decided on a political program: "Stop all military aid to any party in China." The association also announced that it is now planning to organize 500,000 former cabinet personnel so that both the Democratic and Republican parties can take joint action in the November elections this year and the presidential election next year, and support liberals to participate in the election from a non-partisan standpoint. It is reported that the conference made a decision on the foreign policy held by liberals, unanimously advocating "restoring Roosevelt's Three Great Policies," and announced that "imperialism all over the world must stop." Representatives from 35 states have agreed with Yales' foreign policy and urged him to speak to the CIO again. After the meeting, the association decided that the time to organize a third party is not yet ripe, so all work will be carried out temporarily in accordance with the existing policies of the two existing parties. It is reported that the three major progressive groups that convened this political conference held a joint representative meeting on the 5th, deciding to take joint action in the November parliamentary elections and establish a joint action committee to be in charge, "but declaring that it does not hinder the independence of each group." At that time, it was also believed that the organization of a third party was not yet the time, so it was advocated to elect democratic and progressive elements from the Democratic and Republican parties from a non-partisan standpoint.

　　美国三大进步团体决议
    拥护自由派竞选总统
    以停止对蒋政府援助为政纲
    【新华社延安十四日电】芝加哥讯：美产业工会联合会、全国公民政治行动委员会及科学艺术就业独立公民委员会，于九月三十日召开政治会议，出席各界代表自由主义者三百余人，包括前内长伊克斯及前财长摩根索在内。会议特别决定一项政纲：“停止对中国国内任何党派作军事援助”。该会并宣布现在计划组织全国五十万前内阁人员，俾能在今年十一月及明年总统选举中使民主共和两党采取联合行动，从超党派立场支持自由主义人士参加竞选。据悉会议中对自由主义者所持之外交政策有所决定，一致主张“恢复罗斯福的三大政策”，并宣布“全世界的帝国主义必须停止”。与会代表中已有三十五州代表赞同叶莱士的外交政策，并促请他再向产业工会联合会演讲。该会于会后决议目前组织第三党的时机尚未成熟，故一切工作暂按现存两党旧有方针进行。按召开此次政治会议之三大进步团体曾于五日举行联席代表会议，决定在十一月议员选举中采取联合行动，并成立联合行动委员会主其事，“惟声明不妨碍各该团体之独立性”。当时亦认为组织第三党尚非其时，故主张以超党派立场选举民主共和两党中之民主进步分子。
