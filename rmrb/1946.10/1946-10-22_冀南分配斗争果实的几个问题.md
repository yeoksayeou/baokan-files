　　Several Questions Regarding the Distribution of Struggle Fruits in Southern Hebei

　　After the mass struggle ends, the distribution of fruits is the issue of greatest concern to the masses. Farmers who have been impoverished by long-term exploitation naturally and reasonably care about and haggle over this, and it is not "economism."

　　Experience has shown that in some areas, sectarian struggles have developed after the movement, organizations have disintegrated or failed to develop, mostly because the fruit issue was not properly resolved. Recently, leaders in various regions have emphasized grasping the resolution of this issue. Cadres have recognized that distributing fruits is an important task in land reform and is key to organizing the majority of the masses. Many methods have been created:

　　First, Yongzhi, Yuanchao, Gaotang, Chengci and other places where the movement is underway have clearly adopted the method of "clearing land" and "averaging compensation," truly achieving "land to the tillers," which is very good. Yuanchao's fourth and fifth districts reviewed that in the past, landlords only wanted cash when settling accounts, not land, thus leading to a "superficial movement." The masses said, "A spring was wasted, and not even three melons or two dates were divided," which is a lesson worth accepting. In this re-launch, the district leadership proposed satisfying the masses' land demands and breaking through the masses' concerns about rising levels, enabling them to recognize the exploitative basis of the landlords and directly reclaim the land that had been taken away. The peasants clearly know that land is "fundamental," as the saying goes: "Lay the foundation first, then build the house, and buy clothes when you have extra money," etc.; once they understand the policy and eliminate their concerns, they will compete for land again. In some villages in Gaotang and Nanhe, it was found that middle peasants proposed that land should be distributed equally according to the struggle members, one share per person. After patient explanation: in order to achieve every family having land to cultivate and everyone having food to eat, the poorer the more land is needed, and promoting the spirit of "mutual assistance among our own people," making them realize that the method of "less land, more distribution, more land, no distribution" is reasonable and feasible. For the poor who were former puppet soldiers or puppet organization personnel or are still puppet soldiers, Tian Village in Yongzhi adopted the method of, after repentance and self-renewal and public recognition by the masses as good people, they are distributed the fruits the same as poor peasants. The masses feel that those who are not good enough get less, and the farmers' association plants it first, and gives it to them when they have changed for the better. For the family members of puppet soldiers who filled the role of puppet soldiers, the land that their families should have received is first planted or leased by the farmers' association. The puppet soldiers and puppet organization personnel themselves are not calculated according to population.

　　Second, be democratic. Whether the distribution of fruits can be reasonable everywhere and satisfy everyone completely depends on whether the democracy is thoroughly developed. According to the general process of distribution in various places: electing a fruit clearing committee, stipulating specific distribution methods, evaluating classes and ranks, assessing fruit prices, and making appropriate adjustments during specific distribution, all of which require the participation of the masses and the consent of the masses. Chengci and Yuanchao's fourth district follow the general principle of the mass line: first, the whole body widely deliberates and discusses, widely soliciting methods, the group leader's meeting focuses on research, determining preliminary opinions; then announcing to each group, soliciting opinions; and finally focusing on making a resolution, passing it at the general meeting. In Wanggu Village, Feixiang, in these processes, some typical people are found and individually visited to solicit opinions (such as soliciting the opinions of households that grow small local land on the conversion of small local land). These are all examples of fully developing democracy in the distribution of fruits. Tiantaishan Village in Feixiang changed the past method of only based on acreage, but based on standard land, and also referred to whether there is labor and livestock, how many and how good the houses are, whether the life is rich or not, and whether there are businesses or other income to evaluate the levels. In Ningnan Dongwang, before the distribution, the land, small land, sand-alkali land to be compensated to each household in the whole village is converted into standard mu. During the distribution, the evaluators pay attention to adjusting, so that the old, weak, widowed, and orphaned get the land closer to the village, those with labor and livestock get the land farther away, the poorest get the spring land, the second poorest get the wheat stubble, and the second gets the white land. These methods are very good, but it should be noted that the evaluators must come from the masses, and the opinions of the masses must be solicited after the evaluation.

　　In short, the distribution of fruits should implement the three principles of "fast, clean, and fair." For example, in Xixiangyang Village, Fourth District, Chengci County, the fruits were distributed cleanly in three days. However, be careful not to be hasty and sloppy in the fast process, because the main problem with distribution is still suitability (that is, "fairness"). We believe that if democracy can be thoroughly developed, the masses will not only be able to achieve "fairness," but also clearly know the benefits of "fast," and will not make the distribution time drag on for a long time.

　　Third, tightly grasp education before and after distribution. Past experience has shown that the masses are most receptive to education that connects the fruits they have obtained. In Beimenli, Handan, the questions of how the fruits were obtained, where they should be used after distribution, and how to defend the fruits were raised during the distribution, which greatly improved the ideological awareness of the masses. In Changxiang Village, Fourth District, Chengci, a meeting of activists was held before the distribution, starting with "who relies on the general meeting," and leading to "who should all the fruits be distributed to," educating activists to recognize the strength of the masses and overcome the idea of a few people monopolizing the fruits, which had a great effect.

　　Fourth, grasp several specific issues. For example, in the distribution in Yuanchao Fourth District and other places, it is stipulated that men are allocated whole shares according to their level, women are allocated seven-tenths shares, and sisters and children are allocated half shares, which is inappropriate for achieving "average compensation" for land and mobilizing women in the mass movement. Women and children have been oppressed and exploited by landlords in the past. As long as the leadership pays attention to mobilizing them in the mass movement, they will also play a great role. They should receive the same amount of fruits as men. If the masses think that some middle peasants have benefited too much after distributing according to population (because the families of middle peasants are often more populous than the families of the extremely poor and poor peasants), then it is necessary to pay close attention to referring to family circumstances when evaluating levels and appropriately increasing or decreasing the level.

　　As for some areas where fruits are only distributed to farm members or members who participate in the struggle, and not to other poor masses, this hinders the mobilization and organization of the majority. Regarding the distribution of care for military dependents, martyrs' families, and the elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned, various places have adopted methods such as grading and prioritizing the distribution of good land, which should be given more attention in the future. In order to reward militiamen and activists, some places extract a portion from the fruits, and then democratically elect activists to allocate evenly, which must first be agreed by the masses, and the rewards should not be too much, otherwise it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses.

　　冀南分配斗争果实的几个问题
    群众斗争结束后，果实分配是群众所最关心的问题，长期被剥削致穷的农民，一旦讨回老债，他们这种关心、计较，原是很自然很合理的，并不是什么“经济主义”。
    经验证明有些地区运动后发展宗派斗争，组织涣散或没有发展，多是因为果实问题解决的不当。最近各地的领导上已经重视了抓紧解决这一问题、干部已经认识到分配果实是土地改革的重要工作，是组织大多数群众的关键。并创造了许多办法：
    第一、运动正在开展的永智、元朝、高唐、成磁等地明确采取了“清算土地”、“平均补齐”的办法。真正做到“耕者有其田”，是很好的。元朝四、五区检讨过去地主算账只要现款，不要土地，因而流于“表皮运动”，群众都说：“耽误了一春天，分不了三瓜两枣的”，是个值得接受的教训。这次重新发动中，该区领导上提出满足群众的土地要求，并打破群众怕上升等顾虑，使认识地主的压榨基础，直接索回了被夺去的土地。农民很清楚的知道土地是“根本”的，如传说的：“先铺地、后盖房，有了余钱置衣裳”等；他们一旦明了了政策，消除了顾虑，便又会争着要地的。高唐、南和的部分村庄，曾发现中农提出土地要按斗争成员平均分配，人各一份，经耐心解释：说明为达到家家有地种，人人有饭吃，越穷的越需要土地，并发扬“自己人互助”的精神，使其认识到“地少多分，地多不分”的办法合理是行得通的。对于过去当过伪军伪组织人员或现在仍当伪军的贫苦者，永智田村采取，悔过自新群众公认是好人后和贫农一样分得果实，群众认为还不够好的少分给他些，由农会先种，等转变好时再给他；对于充伪军的伪属，把他家应得土地由农会先种或出租，伪军及伪组织人员本人不按人口计算。
    第二、要民主，果实分配能否做到处处合理，人人满意，完全要看民主的发扬是否彻底，根据各地分配的一般过程是：选举清算果实委员会，规定具体分配办法，评议阶层及等阶、评定果实价格具体分配时的适当调济，这些都需要群众参加，征得群众同意。成磁及元朝四区走群众路线的一般原则是：先由全体普遍酝酿讨论、广泛征求办法，组长会上集中研究，定夺初步意见；再到各组宣布，征求意见；最后集中做出决议，全体会上通过。肥乡王固村在这几个过程中，并找些典型人，个别访问，征求意见（如征求种小当地的户，对小当地折合的意见）。这些都是在分配果实中充分发扬民主的范例。肥乡天台山村改变了过去只按地亩，而是按标准地外，并参照有无劳力畜力、房舍多少好坏、生活富裕与否及有无生意其他收入等情形评议等级，宁南东汪在未分配前将赔偿给全村各户之大地、小地，砂碱地折合成标准亩，在分配时，评议员注意调齐，使老弱孤寡分得的地离村较近，有劳畜力的分得较远，最穷的分春地，次穷的分麦茬，再次的分白地，这些办法是很不错的，但需要注意，评议员一定要从群众中来，评议后一定要征求群众的意见。
    总之，分配果实要实行“快、净、公”三个原则，如成磁县四区西向阳村三天即把果实分净。但是快中切忌草率马虎，因为分配的主要问题还是合适（也即是“公”）。我们认为：如果能彻底发扬民主，群众不但能做到“公”，而且也很清楚的知道“快”对他们的好处，不会使分配时间拖得很长。
    第三、在分配前后要抓紧进行教育，以往经验，联系群众的获得果实进行教育，群众最容易接受，邯郸北门里在分配中提出果实怎样得来的？分到后要用到那里？怎样保卫果实等问题，大大提高群众的思想觉悟，成磁四区长巷村在分配前召开积极分子会，由“开大会靠谁”谈起，扯到“果实都应分给谁”，教育积极分子认识群众力量，克服少数人独吞果实思想，收效很大。
    第四、要掌握几个具体问题，如元朝四区等地在分配中规定男子按本等级的整股批分，妇女按七分股，姐妹儿童按半股，这在达到“平均补齐”土地以及在群运中发动妇女的目的上是欠妥的。妇女儿童过去一样受地主的压迫剥削，只要领导上注意在群运中发动他们，他们也会起到很大的作用，他们应当和男子得到仝量的果实，假如按人分配后，群众都以为某些中农沾光太大（因为往往中农的家庭是比赤贫及贫农人口多的），那就是在评议时须十分注意参照家庭情况，适当的增减级的问题了。
    至于有些地区果实只分给农会员或参加斗争的成员，不分给其他贫苦群众，这对发动与组织大多数上有妨碍。关于分配中照顾军属烈属及老弱孤寡，各地采用等级及尽先分配分得好地等办法，今后应更注意。为奖励民兵及积极分子，各地从果实中抽出一部分，然后民主选举积极者平均批分，这要先征得群众同意，奖励物资也不宜过多，不然会遭致群众不满。
