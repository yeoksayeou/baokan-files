　　Talking about Alkali Production
    Wang Yinggu
    Any strong nation has a developed industry. Conversely, any nation that does not seek to develop its industry will be weak.

    Currently, the government's policy focuses on developing industry in the border regions as a primary task. This is precisely the time for us industrial workers to put our minds to work. I am throwing out this brick in the hope that it will spark everyone's interest in industrial research.

    Various industries, especially the chemical industry, are more or less involved with the alkali production industry. Moreover, many factories cannot exist at all without alkali. This illustrates that the development of the alkali production industry directly affects the development of other industries. In the border regions, the old industries of oil and fat and fiber are the main ones, and these factories are the major consumers of various alkalis. They have always relied on foreign supplies, and therefore often suffer great losses due to raw material shortages. If this problem cannot be solved, it will be difficult to develop industry. In other words, how can the majority of old border region industries that rely on alkali as a raw material be developed without an alkali production industry? As for many factories that use alkali as their main raw material that the border region does not have today, such as sulfur dyes, glass, wool textile dyeing, refined oil, absorbent cotton, electro-optical cotton thread, etc., these are all industries that must be developed. Without a guaranteed supply of alkali, even with capital and technology, people will not dare to boldly establish and expand them. These facts are sufficient to illustrate the relationship between alkali and the development of other industries. It helps the development of old industries in the border region and promotes the growth of new industries. In the development of industrial plans, alkali production is a very important link.

    Speaking of alkali production, the first thing to study is the conditions for producing alkali raw materials in the border region. On both banks of the Fuyang River, from Yongnian in the south to Julu in the north, there are patches of alkali flats (some produce only saltpeter, others are mixed with saltpeter, magnesium, etc.), among which the area around Pingxiang produces the most saltpeter-rich soil. According to local farmers with long-term experience in leaching saltpeter, at least three million jin of pure dry mirabilite can be collected annually from the underground moisture rising to the surface. Although this is not a very reliable figure, if we calculate based on the area of the alkali flats in that area, at five jin of saltpeter per square zhang per year, this figure is not an exaggeration at all. This large output is sufficient to supply a factory producing 1.5 million jin of alkali per year. Mirabilite is an ideal material for alkali production. Except for electrolysis, all existing alkali production methods use it as a raw material. With this large output, the raw material conditions are sufficient, and a supply of 1.5 million jin of alkali per year for civilian and industrial use in the entire border region is more than enough.

    Next, let's talk about the prospects for the alkali production industry in the border region. The general argument is that since the Solvay process of alkali production became popular, the Leblanc process has been eliminated, and electrolysis is even more overwhelming. This statement is completely correct when studying theory. Because electrolysis of salt or the ammonia-soda process can obtain 100% sodium carbonate (soda ash), while the best purity of sodium chloride (other alkalis are not like this) obtained by the Leblanc process is only 99%. The raw material used in electrolysis and the ammonia-soda process—salt—is cheaper and more common than mirabilite (the opposite is true in this border region), which is why the Leblanc process has been eliminated. However, when setting up a factory, one cannot be bound by this mechanical argument and must decide on the manufacturing method based on local raw material conditions. Otherwise, if electrolysis is used in places where electricity prices are high and far from salt production, or if the ammonia-soda process is stubbornly used in places where there is no production of ammonia or sal ammoniac, it will certainly fail. In this border region, ammonia and sal ammoniac are not produced, but there is readily available mirabilite (in places where it is not available, the cost of using salt and sulfuric acid byproducts is naturally higher) as a raw material. The Leblanc process does not have differences in the quality of finished products due to manual or machine manufacturing. It is very suitable and practical to adopt the Leblanc process for alkali production in this border region. It's just that the finished product is a little inferior, and this is a major concern in competing with foreign goods. But it is not absolutely certain that it will be suppressed by foreign goods, because: (1) Local raw materials are manufactured and used locally, eliminating several layers of transportation costs, and the value will be lower than that of goods from afar. (2) Although soda ash has only 99% purity, the other one percent of impurities is only a trace amount of sodium hydroxide and salt, and a little bit of nitrate that has not reacted completely. It will not be harmful in other uses except for laboratory applications. (3) It is not only producing or only selling soda ash, but other caustic soda and stink alkali (sodium sulfide) can also be made perfectly. In the border region, the consumption of caustic soda and stink alkali for industrial use is no less than or exceeds that of soda ash. With these three characteristics, we have sufficient conditions to counter future foreign goods, not to mention the government's policy of protecting industry. However, one point must be strictly noted, and that is the output and price of raw materials. Speaking of this, we must first study the source and process of nitrate. The production situation of nitrate is: mirabilite evaporates with groundwater and rises to the surface, and local farmers use their spare time to sweep the nitrate soil on the ground, soak it in water, and fish out the mud and sand, and the mirabilite itself crystallizes out. The work procedure is that simple, and it does not cost any money except for a little effort. Things that are so easy to obtain should have a large output and the price should be very cheap, but the opposite is true. If you intend to buy nitrate, you must pay a price more than ten times greater than the labor spent by the seller. The reasons for this are: First, the banks of the Fuyang River are mostly paddy fields, there is a lot of work in the gardens, there is little spare time for farmers, and the current use of nitrate is not very large, and there is no profit beyond agricultural production, so farmers are unwilling to spend effort to leach nitrate. Second, there is the price of saltpeter for comparison. Third, the price sold to leather workshops has always been high (leather workshops do not use much). Fourth, there are occasional exports, although the quantity is very small, but the price is unexpectedly high. If you want to lower the price of nitrate, you must start by increasing production. When the production volume is large, the price will naturally depreciate. Things taken from the ground, and inexhaustible ones, what is the difficulty in demanding expansion of production? As long as a nitrate leaching campaign is launched in the nitrate-producing areas, the above problems will be solved. At the same time, the income of farmers is increased. If farmers do not have time to participate in this movement, the vast number of women and children can take on the task (women in the Pingxiang area are quite conservative and rarely go out, and rarely go to the fields). If this work is promoted by the factory itself, I am afraid that it will not be very effective and must rely on the assistance of the local government. If this problem can be solved, the alkali production industry in the border region has a bright future.

    Yongsheng Chemical Industry Cooperative has already raised funds to prepare for alkali production. The scale is very small, the equipment is semi-mechanized, and the Leblanc method is used with mirabilite as the raw material. It is planned to manufacture soda ash, caustic soda, and stink alkali. Looking at the equipment, regular production can produce 1,000 to 1,500 market jin of various alkalis per day. With such a production volume, the civilian and industrial alkali use in the border region today can probably be supplied without worry. If it can gradually develop, it will also greatly help the development of industries such as papermaking, soap, glass, sulfur dyes, refined oils and fats, cotton degreasing, leather depilation, bright cotton yarn, and wool textile dyeing in the border region in the future. I hope that the friends in charge of the cooperative will redouble their efforts for the industrial construction of the border region. I also ask the government authorities, people in the industrial sector, and social elites to give it great help and guidance. Together, we will support this emerging business well, which will have a better impact on the industrial development of the border region.

　　谈制碱
    王膺固
    凡是富强的国家，它有发达的工业。反过来说：凡是不谋发展工业的国家，它将是衰弱的。
    目前政府施政方针，把发展边区工业列为首要工作，这正是我们从事工业工作者，好好运用脑筋的时候了，我抛出这块砖去，希望它能引起大家对工业研究的兴趣。
    各种工业，尤其是化学工业，或多或少是和制碱工业打着交道的，更有许多工厂，没有碱就根本不能存在。这说明了，制碱业的发达与否，是直接影响着其他工业的发展的。边区旧有工业中，油脂和纤维工业是主要的，这些工厂，都是各种碱的大顾主，它们一向是仰赖外货供给。所以时常因闹原料恐慌而蒙受很大的损失。这一问题若不能解决，工业是很难发展的。也就是说，没有制碱工业怎么能发展大多数以碱为原料的边区旧有工业呢？至于说到许多以碱为主体原料的边区今日还没有的工厂，如硫化染料、玻璃、毛纺织染、精炼油、脱脂棉、电光棉线等等，都是些必须发展的工业，若是没有碱的供给不虞的保证，虽有资本和技术，也是不敢大胆建立与扩充的。这些，足资说明碱与其他工业发展的关系了。它有助于边区旧有工业的发展，并推动新的工业滋长起来的作用。在发展工业计划上，制碱是很重要的一环。
    谈到制碱，首先应该研究边区出产制碱原料的条件。在滏阳河的两岸，南起永年北迄巨鹿，片片断断的广布着碱茬址（有的单出硝，有的盐硝镁等混合着），其中以平乡一带出硝地面最广大。据当地久有淋硝经验的农民说，地下潮出来的芒硝，一年至少可收三百万斤纯干者。这虽然是个不很可靠的数字，若依那一带的碱茬地的面积，按一平方丈每年出硝五斤计算，这个数字，一点也不夸张。这一大产量，供给一个年产一百五十万斤碱的工厂使用，是没有问题的。芒硝是制碱的理想材料，除了电解，现有的任何制碱方法都是用它做原料。有了这一大产量，原料条件是足够了，全边区的民用和工业用碱，每年有一百五十万斤的供给，也是绰绰有余的。
    其次谈到边区制碱工业的展望。一般的论调是：自从酸盐制碱法风行以来，路布兰法已被淘汰了，电解法更是压倒一切。这种说法，在研究理论的时候是完全正确的。因为电解食盐或氨盐法，都能得到百分之百的碳酸钠（纯碱），而路布兰法就是工作的最好得到的盐酸钠（其他的碱不是这样的）的纯度，也只有百分之九十九；电解和氨盐法（氨盐法也可用硝代盐）用的原料——食盐，比芒硝价廉而普遍（本边区则正相反），这就是路布兰法被淘汰的原因。但是办起工厂来，就不能拘于这种机械的论调，必须根据当地原料条件来决定制造的方法。否则如果在电价高昂距离盐产远的地方采用电解法，不产生或硇砂的地方硬用氨盐法，一定会遭到失败。本边区里不产氨及硇砂，但是有现成的芒硝（没有的地方是用食盐和硫酸副产的自然成本高了）做原料，路布兰法又不因手工，机器的制造而有成品品质的差别，在本边区采用路布兰法制碱，是很附合条件，切合实际的。只是成品较次一点，这一点对于抗衡外货上是要有很大的顾虑。但并不是绝对的就会被外货压下去。因为：（一）就地原料就地制造就地使用，免去了几层运输费用，价值会比远来的外货低廉。（二）纯碱虽然只有百分之九十九的纯度，那其他的一份不纯物也不过是微量的氢氧化钠和食盐及一点未作用完全的硝，除了实验室里应用以外，在其他的用途上是不会有妨害的。（三）并不是只产纯碱或只能销纯碱，其他的火碱臭碱（硫化碱）也能够做到尽善尽美的。本边区的工业用碱，火碱、臭碱的用量，是不亚于或者超过纯碱的。有这三个特点，我们便有足够条件抗衡将来的外货，何况还有政府保护工业的政策呢。不过有一点必须严格注意，就是原料产量和价格。谈到这里，必须先研究一下硝的产源和过程。硝的产出情况是：芒硝随地下水汽上蒸，潮出了地面，当地农人利用农闲时间，扫来地上的硝土，浸在水里，捞出泥砂，芒硝自己便结晶出来。工作程序就是这样的简单，除了费点工夫以外，不花费一文本钱。这样容易得到的东西，产量应该很大，价钱应当很便宜，但是事实却正相反。如果打算收买到硝，必须付出比卖硝者所花的劳力大上十倍以上的价钱。考其原因：一是滏阳河的沿岸多是水田，园地里的工作多，农闲的时间少，硝的现时用途还不大，没有超越农产的利润，农民就不肯花出工夫去淋硝。二是有火硝的价格比着。三是历来卖给皮坊的价格大（皮坊用量不多）。四是偶有出口，数量虽然甚微，但是价钱却出乎意想的高。要想压低硝的价格，必须从提高产量上着手，生产量大了，价格自然贬低。地下取的东西，而且是取之不尽的，要求扩大生产，这有什么困难呢？只要出硝地区，发动起淋硝运动来，就把上述问题解决了。同时又增加了农民收入。如果农民没有时间参与这一运动，广大的妇女儿童，是可以担当起来的（平乡一带妇女相当守旧不常出门，很少下地）。这项工作，若是由工厂自己去推行。怕是没有多大效力，必须依赖当地政府的协助。这个难题如能解决，边区的制碱工业是有远大前途的。
    永生化学工业社已在集资筹备制碱，规模甚小，设备是半机器的，采用路布兰法以芒硝做原料，计划制造纯碱、火碱、臭碱。观于设备，正规生产起来每日可产各种碱一千至一千五百市斤，能有如此产量，今日边区的民用工业用碱，可能供给无虞了。倘能逐渐发展，将来对于边区的制纸、肥皂、玻璃、硫化染料、精炼油脂、棉花脱脂、皮革脱毛、光亮棉纱、毛纺织染等工业的发展，帮助亦很大。惟望主持该社的朋友们，为边区工业建设而加倍的努力。更要求政府当局工业界人士社会贤达给它以大力的帮助和指导。共同把这一新兴事业，好好的扶植起来，这对边区工业发展会有更好的影响的。
