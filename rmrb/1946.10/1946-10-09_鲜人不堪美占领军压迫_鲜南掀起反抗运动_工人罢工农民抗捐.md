Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Seoul dispatch: The people in the U.S. military-occupied area of southern Korea have launched a wave against assassination politics. Starting with the strike of mine and railway workers on September 23rd, workers on the main railway lines of southern Korea launched a general sympathy strike on the 24th. By the 16th, workers in the maritime, electrical, and food industries also announced a solidarity strike. Farmers in southern Korea have also launched a movement to resist taxes and rents. The Farmers' Federation issued a declaration on the 29th, stating that farmers will support workers with actions to fight for the freedom and rights to survival. The trade unions and peasant groups participating in the strike jointly issued a declaration demanding the abolition of assassination squads, guaranteeing personal freedom, implementing the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference declaration, establishing a democratic and free order, releasing arrested democratic activists, rescinding the order to close three democratic newspapers, opposing the U.S. military's trampling on human rights, stopping the U.S. military's beating and raping of women, demanding the implementation of labor laws that protect workers and staff as implemented in the north, and implementing democratic land reform. U.S. military commander Major General Hodge made a threatening speech on the Seoul radio station on the 26th, claiming, "The purpose of this strike is to express distrust of Americans in Korea." He also said, "The strike is illegal, and I advise you to resume work as soon as possible." The next day, U.S. troops patrolled, set up outposts and posts in the city, and assisted the police in surrounding the residential areas of railway workers, threatening and enticing workers, attempting to steal a list of worker leaders for arrest, but the striking workers unanimously replied, "We are all leaders. If you want to arrest someone, you can arrest me." This thwarted the police's conspiracy. The strike is continuing to expand.

　　鲜人不堪美占领军压迫
    鲜南掀起反抗运动
    工人罢工农民抗捐
    【新华社延安六日电】汉城讯：朝鲜南部美军占领区的人民，掀起反对暗杀政治的浪潮，以九月廿三日矿山、铁路工人的罢工为起点，廿四日朝鲜南部主要铁路干线的工人即发动同情总罢工，至十六日海员电气和食品企业的工人也宣布同盟罢工，朝鲜南部的农民也展开抗捐抗租的运动。农民联合会二十九日发表宣言，表示农民将以行动来支援工人，以争取生存的自由权利。参加罢工的工会与农民团体共同发表宣言，要求废除暗杀团，保障人身自由，实践莫斯科一外长会议宣言，建立民主自由的秩序，释放被捕民主活动家，收回封闭三家民主报纸的成命，反对美军蹂躏人权，停止美军打人与奸淫妇女，要求实行像北部所实行的保护工人与职员的劳动法，和实施民主的土地改革。美军司令霍奇少将，于二十六日在汉城广播电台发表恫吓演说，声称：“此次罢工的目的，是为了对在朝鲜的美国人表示不信任”。并说：“罢工是非法的，奉劝诸君还是早日复工的好”。翌日即出动美军巡逻，市区布哨设岗，并协助警察包围铁路职工住宅区，威胁利诱工人，企图窃取工人领袖名单，以便逮捕，但罢工工人均异口同声答以“我等均为领袖，如要捕人，可捕我去”。致使警察阴谋未遂。现罢工继续扩大中。
