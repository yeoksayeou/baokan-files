The Eleventh District Works to "Prioritize Military Families Over Oneself"
    Ci County Military Families Obtain Good Land
    Everyone Smiles and Lives a Better Life
    [Report from this newspaper, Ci County] The liberated peasants of this county are enthusiastically caring for military families. When the struggle for land distribution in the Eleventh District bore fruit, under the slogan of "Prioritize military families, then oneself," 1,141 dependents of revolutionary martyrs and military families were allocated 1,546 mu of irrigated land, garden land, and good dry land. Adding this to their original land, each person now has an average of 3.7 mu. Based on average year yields, each person can harvest three shi (20 jin dou) of fine grain per year, enough for the whole year's consumption. In addition, they were allocated 493 houses, 714 farming implements, and grain and funds for daily necessities. There are no more problems for the martyr's and military family's dependents in the entire district to "establish their households" and "become self-reliant." The military families all said with beaming smiles to the masses, "The villagers treat us so well." Zhao Fubao, a demobilized soldier's father, had been a hired laborer his whole life and never owned a mu of land or a single room. Now he has 35 mu of good land and a very beautiful brick house with a courtyard. He requested the government, "Our liberation is even better than the villagers', so please don't give us any more preferential treatment in the future." (Chen Tao)

　　第十一区作到“先军属后自己”
    磁县军属获得良田
    个个眉开眼笑生活向上
    【本报磁县讯】本县翻身农民热诚照顾军属，第十一区群众分配斗争果实时，在“先军属，后自己”的口号下，给一千一百四十一口烈属军属分得水地、园地及好旱地一千五百四十六亩，加上他们原有的土地，每人平均已有三亩七分，按平年收成，每人每年能收三石（二十斤斗）细粮，足够全年食用；另外又给他们分了四百九十三间房子，七百一十四件农具及粮款用具等等。全区烈属军属“建立家务”“自力更生”已无问题；军属们都眉开眼笑的对群众说：“乡亲们对待俺真好。”荣退军人赵付保的父亲当了一辈子长工，没置下一亩地，一间房，现在已有了三十五亩好地，一座很漂亮的砖房院子，他向政府请求说：“俺翻身翻的比众乡亲都好，以后再不要谁的优待啦。”（陈涛）
