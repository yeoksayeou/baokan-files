Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th (Delayed Dispatch) The "Demand U.S. Troops Withdraw from China Movement Week" in Harbin has begun. The working committee organized by various circles includes Li Guojun, Speaker of the Harbin Provisional Council, banker Yu Zan, Xu Xinzhi, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, gentry Xie Yuqin, and representatives from various circles. At its first meeting on the 13th, the committee decided to immediately launch extensive publicity activities. Ten districts in the city will hold separate meetings and parades. Harbin newspapers have been publishing news of the "Demand U.S. Troops Withdraw from China" in prominent positions for days. The *Northeast Daily* published an editorial entitled "Chiang Kai-shek and Wu Sangui," pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek had no right to bring in American troops, and the U.S. military should also fulfill the decisions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference and immediately withdraw from China! The newspaper warned Chiang and the U.S. by saying: "If the Qing troops introduced by Wu Sangui were only eliminated by the Chinese people after 260 years of struggle, then the Japanese invaders introduced by Chiang Kai-shek were eliminated by the Chinese people in just 14 years! Therefore, the U.S. and Chiang should look at 300 years of Chinese history and take the lessons of Japan's failure as a warning."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th Harbin's "U.S. Troops Out of China Movement Week" on the third, fourth, and fifth days (i.e., the 13th, 14th, and 15th), representatives of youth, students, women, and cultural and educational circles in the city successively gathered. On the 13th, student representatives from major middle schools gathered at the Harbin Democratic Youth League, expressing their indignation and determination that Chinese youth will inherit the glorious traditions of the "May Fourth" and "December Ninth" movements and resolutely carry out the anti-imperialist struggle. On the 14th, at a forum of women from all walks of life in Harbin, Ms. Han Youtong, Director of the Education Department of Nenjiang Province and a member of the China Democratic League, used her personal experience to denounce the atrocities of the U.S. military in Chongqing, Shanghai, and other places, especially the insults to women. Sixty-nine-year-old Granny Lan used her own eyes to compare the situation of the Eight-Power Allied Forces entering Beijing in the庚子 year and oppressing the Chinese people with the crimes of the United States in China today. The Harbin Education Association, the Journalists Association, the Music Federation, the Fine Arts Association, and writers Xiao Jun, Shu Qun, and Jin Ren also initiated a forum for cultural and educational circles on the same day. The meeting decided to establish the "Harbin Cultural and Educational Circles Working Committee for Demanding the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from China" to actively carry out publicity work and, in the name of the working committee, launch a campaign to support the front lines and comfort the democratic allied forces who are defending peace. Finally, a telegram was sent to the Preparatory Committee of the People's Congress of the Liberated Areas in Yan'an, requesting that the People's Congress of the Liberated Areas be convened as soon as possible. More than 5,000 faculty, staff, and students of the Northeast Military and Political University sent telegrams to the UN Security Council, Stalin, Truman, the American Political Action Committee, and the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Committee, requesting that the U.S. authorities implement the democratic policies of the late U.S. President Roosevelt, immediately stop unilaterally aiding Chiang, investigate the crimes of the U.S. military in China, and severely punish the principal culprits of previous incidents. The telegram firmly stated that the Chinese people refuse to recognize all traitorous treaties and loans concluded by Chiang Kai-shek with the United States in order to carry out the civil war. The telegram requested that the UN Security Council and the British and Soviet governments adhere to the decisions of the Moscow Three-Power Conference, investigate the extent of U.S. implementation, and request the UN General Assembly to discuss the issue of non-enemy country troops stationed in other countries.
