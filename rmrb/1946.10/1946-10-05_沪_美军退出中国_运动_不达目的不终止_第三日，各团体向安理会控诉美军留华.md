Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Shanghai dispatch: On the third day of the "US Troops Out of China" movement, various groups reconvened and resolved: (1) The "US Troops Out of China" movement should not have a time limit in our China and should continue until the complete withdrawal of US troops. (2) Cable to the United Nations Security Council, urging it to pay close attention to the development of the situation in China and urging the withdrawal of US troops. (3) Send greetings to the American "Political Action Committee" and the "Far Eastern Democratic Policy Committee" and other groups. (4) Express admiration to Wallace for his opposition to the current US foreign policy. (5) Compile the materials of this movement into a booklet and distribute it to the public.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Shanghai dispatch: The "US Troops Out of China" movement, which is now vigorously underway in Shanghai, was jointly launched on the 23rd of last month by ten people's organizations, including the Shanghai People's World Peace Promotion Association, the Democratic National Construction Association, the Shanghai People's Organizations Liaison Association, the China International Human Rights Protection Association, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the National Christian Women's Temperance Union, the Shanghai Women's Federation, the China Rural Economic Research Association, and the Economic Enterprises Advancement Association. On that day, a reception was held at the Shanghai Wine House on Gordon Road for foreign journalists, and a formal statement was issued requesting the US authorities to immediately withdraw US troops stationed in China and withdraw all aid to the Kuomintang government that would fuel the civil war. The hosts of the meeting included Zhang Jiongbo, Zhang Naiqi, Ma Xulun (represented by Hu Ziying), Wu Yaozong, Ye Shengtao, Liu Wang Liming, Xu Guangping, Shen Tilan, Qin Liufang, and others. Shen Tilan delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of this meeting was to respond to the "Withdraw from China Week" of American peace advocates and Wallace's speech, emphasizing that the ten people's organizations' position on the US policy towards China was not limited to demanding the withdrawal of US troops from China, but also demanded the complete withdrawal of American military and economic assistance, that is, fundamentally demanding that the United States change its policy towards China. Because Truman, in his actual actions, has violated the policies established by the late US President Roosevelt and the will of the American people, dragging China into the entire civil war. If this policy remains unchanged, the Chinese civil war will not cease for a day, eventually leading to a third world war. Subsequently, diplomat Chen Youren was invited to speak. Based on his years of experience in Sino-US and Sino-Soviet diplomatic activities, he proved that some people in the United States are preparing for a US-Soviet war, and some people in China are also trying to profit from it, but the middle elements in China are willing to use China as a bridge for US-Soviet cooperation. After vehemently criticizing the Hurley policy, Chen pointed out that after Marshall's return to China in April of this year, his attitude had completely changed, returning to the Hurley era, and he did not pay attention to the opinions of the middle elements. The recent sale of surplus materials greatly encouraged one side in China and fueled the Chinese civil war. If the United States can resolutely withdraw its aid to China, the government's willful attitude will be greatly improved. Chen loudly questioned: In accordance with the Moscow Conference, the Soviet army has already withdrawn from China, why are US troops still inactive? Zhang Jiongbo then read out the statement of the China People's World Peace Promotion Association, condemning the Kuomintang government for being stubbornly incorrigible and demanding that the United States immediately freeze the sale of surplus materials to the Kuomintang government. In his speech, Peng Wenying pointed out that China is an independent country, and now that there are US soldiers everywhere, the Chinese people are already full of suspicion and fear. Peng showed the newly published Xinmin Evening News, which printed the headline "US Soldiers Kill Rickshaw Puller," which aroused righteous indignation among readers. Peng continued: If US troops do not withdraw, such incidents that harm Sino-US relations will be endless. Gu said at the end: Americans once helped the Qing Dynasty suppress the Taiping Rebellion, but revolutionary forces cannot be suppressed, and the situation today is completely different.

　　沪“美军退出中国”运动
    不达目的不终止
    第三日，各团体向安理会控诉美军留华
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：“美军退出中国”运动第三日，各团体再度集会，决议：（一）“美军退出中国”运动，在我们中国不应该有时间的限制，要一直继续到美军完全撤退为止。（二）致电联合国安全理事会，提请该会密切注意中国局势之发展，并促请美军撤退。（三）电美国“政治行动委员会”及“远东民主政策委员会”等团体致意。（四）电华莱士对其反对美国现行外交政策表示欣佩。（五）将此次运动材料编成小册子，散发民众。
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：现在上海猛烈开展的“美军退出中国”运动，系由上海人民世界和平促进会、民主建国会、上海人民团体联谊会、中国国际人权保障会、全国文艺协会、中华基督教妇女节制会、上海妇女联谊会、中国农村经济研究会、经济事业协进会等十个人民团体，于上月二十三日联合发起。当日曾假戈登路上海酒楼招待外国记者，发表正式声明，要求美当局立即撤退驻华美军，并撤退一切足以助长内战的对国民党政府的一切援助。该会主持人计有张絅伯、章乃器、马叙伦（胡子婴代）、吴耀宗、叶圣陶、刘王立明、许广平、沈体兰、秦柳方等。首由沈体兰氏致词，略谓：此会召集目的，在响应美国和平人士的“退出中国周”与华莱士演说，强调该十人民团体关于美国对华政策之主张，并非仅限于要求美军撤出中国、而且要求美国军事经济援助之完全撤退，即在基本上要求美国改变其对华政策。因为杜鲁门已在其实际行动中，违反了美故罗斯福总统所厘订之政策和美国人民之意旨，拿中国卷入整个内战之中。此政策如继续不变，中国内战必一日不息，终至引起第三次大战。接着，外交家陈友仁氏被邀发言，彼以其多年从事中美、中苏外交活动之经历，证明美国有人正从事准备美苏战争，中国亦有人正妄图从中取利，然中国之中间分子则愿以中国为美苏合作之桥梁。陈氏于猛烈抨击赫尔利政策后，指出马歇尔于今年四月再度来华后，面目全非，重又回到赫尔利时代，对中间份子之意见亦不予重视，最近之剩余物资买卖，大大鼓励中国之一方，助长了中国内战。若美国能毅然撤回其对华援助，政府一意孤行之态度，必大为改善。陈氏大声质问：遵照莫斯科会议，苏军早已撤出中国，为何美军仍无动静？张絅伯氏继起宣读中国人民世界和平促进会之声明，谴责国民党政府已冥顽不灵到绝望之地步，要求美国立即冻结售予国民党政府的剩余物资。彭文应氏讲话中，指出中国系独立国家，现在美兵满街皆是，中国人民心中早已疑惧丛生。彭氏出示刚出版之新民晚报，报上印有“美军打死车夫”六个大字，读者无不义愤填膺。彭氏继称：美军一日不撤退，此种有伤中美感情之事件必无穷尽。鼓氏末称：美人曾助满清镇压太平天国，然革命力量是压不住的，今日情形已非皆比。
