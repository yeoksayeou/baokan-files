　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 10th. The Yan'an community, in response to the "American Troops Out of China" rally, sent a telegram to all circles in Shanghai, Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Guangdong:

　　Having learned that democratic figures from all circles are responding to the "American Troops Out of China Movement," we are extremely excited and encouraged. The military and civilians of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the liberated areas deeply recognize, through their own personal experiences, that the U.S. government's policy of aiding Chiang is truly the main reason for the expansion of the Chinese civil war. We are willing to work together with democratic figures across the country to fight to the end to compel American troops to withdraw from China and achieve national independence and democratic peace!

    【新华社延安十日电】延安各界响应美军退出中国大会致沪渝港粤各界电文：
    得悉各界民主人士响应美国的“退出中国运动”，我们十分兴奋鼓舞。陕甘宁边区以及解放区军民以自己亲身的体验，深刻认识美国政府的援蒋政策实在是中国内战扩大的主要原因。我们愿意和全国民主人士一起，为促使美军退出中国实现民族独立与民主和平奋斗到底！
