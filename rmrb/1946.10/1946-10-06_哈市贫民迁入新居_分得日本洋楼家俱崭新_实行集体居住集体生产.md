Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 2nd—The impoverished people of Harbin, who have been allocated enemy and puppet properties and public housing, are implementing collective living and collective production, and their days of poverty and distress are over. More than 2,000 railway workers and their families in Sanshu Xiangfang, Guxiangtun, received more than 6,500 rooms of public housing free of charge, greatly boosting their work enthusiasm. An old railway worker said, "After working as a railway worker for nineteen years, I no longer have to worry about food, clothing, and housing. I will work even harder in the future." In Gou Nangang's foreign-style houses, twelve poverty associations were established, and the proceeds from the sale of enemy property will be used to establish a livestock cooperative in the nearby grasslands for collective production. The impoverished people who moved into the Fuchang Company building received enemy-property weaving machines and are planning to organize a wool weaving cooperative. After the impoverished people in the Geler sub-district of the Xinyang District moved into the magnificent building, they immediately organized housing management. 337 impoverished households (including workers, vendors, rickshaw pullers, and refugees) in Daowai were allocated Japanese houses on Daoli Yimian Street, Shitoudao Street, and Dongmajiagou. Each Japanese-style house is furnished with brand new Japanese furniture. Nearly a thousand impoverished households in the Xinyang District have successively established groups for electricity, water supply, fire prevention, and sanitation, and have drafted a code of conduct, living a collective life with joy and happiness.

    【新华社哈尔滨二日电】分得敌伪和公产房屋的哈市贫民，实行集体居住、集体生产，穷愁的日子已经过去。三树香坊顾乡屯的二千余铁路工人和家属，无代价的分得了六千五百余间公产房屋后，工作情绪大为提高。一个老铁路工人说：“干了十九年铁路工人，这一下子吃穿住都不愁了，以后又更加紧干活。”沟南岗洋房并成立十二个贫民分会，将变卖敌产所得，准备利用住地附近草原，举办牲畜合作社，集体生产。搬进福昌公司大楼的贫民则得到了敌产织毛机器，正计划组织毛织合作社。新阳区共乐分区贫民搬进雄伟的大楼后，即自动组织房屋管理，道外三百三十七户贫民（包括工人、摊贩、车夫与难民）分住道里一面街、石头道街、东马家沟日人房屋，每所日本洋房里面都摆设的崭新的日本家俱。新阳区近千户贫民，陆续分设电灯、水道、防火建设、卫生等组，并拟定生活公约，欢天喜地的过着集体生活。
