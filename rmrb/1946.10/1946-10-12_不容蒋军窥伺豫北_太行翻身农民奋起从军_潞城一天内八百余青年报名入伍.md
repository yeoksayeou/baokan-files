　　Not Allowing the Chiang Troops to Spy on Northern Henan
　　Taihang Turned-Over Peasants Rise Up to Join the Army
　　800 Youths in Lucheng Sign Up for the Army in One Day
　　[Report from this newspaper in Changzhi, 8th] As the Chiang troops spy on Northern Henan, waiting for an opportunity to invade Taihang, a new wave of enthusiasm for joining the Eighth Route Army has been sparked throughout the region. Young peasants who have turned over after recovering land are signing up for the government in droves, asking to go to the front lines. Older people are urging their sons to quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, those good-for-nothings. Young wives are seeing off their husbands as they join the army to defend their happy families. In Zanzhuang, 480 young people signed up for the army in seven days. Li Chunyi and eight other young people from Beigouli Village asked to go to the front lines together. Li Chunyi said, "In the past, Japanese devils arrested me and made me a 'security soldier,' and I spent 100 yuan to escape. This time, it is to defend our own turned-over life, and I am voluntarily joining the army." When Ji Wenxiu's mother from Baian Village sent him to join the army, she told him, "Son! This time, the bullies have been defeated, and my anger has been vented, and the land has been recovered; if it weren't for the Communist Party, my stomach would have burst with anger! Good child, go ahead, hold back Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan and don't let them come again!" Twelve young people from the village joined the army in one day. More than 300 young people in Yuci signed up for the army, all shouting, "We won't go home until we defeat Yan Xishan!" Chen Jinghe, the village chief of Qimu Dasang Village, led eleven young people to sign up. The enthusiasm of the turned-over peasants in Lucheng to join the army is even higher. On the 28th of last month, 813 young people in the county signed up in one day. In various villages, gongs and drums are sounding, and groups of young people are patting their chests and shouting, "Loyally protect the home for everyone, we mean what we say, and today we will walk in front!" Old man Shen Rinsheng taught his son Xiao Liu, "Chairman Mao has worked hard to lead us to turn over, and we must protect it to be worthy of Chairman Mao!" Thirty-three young people in the city have all vowed to drive away the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and teach the American imperialists a lesson. In Changzhi, Huguan, Xiyang, Bo'ai, Wenxian and other places, there are calls to join the army everywhere. Chen Yusheng, a worker at Taihang No. 1 Middle School, also asked the school to sign him up for the army.
