Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th: When Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, met with reporters in Chongqing on the 12th, he stated, "Democratic League members are not enthusiastic about holding official positions. Before the overall situation of unity, democracy, and peace is settled, the Democratic League does not hope for special favor from the government." Zhang advocated that the one-party dictatorship should end, and the Kuomintang should improve its politics and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People, with the sincerity of implementing the two major principles of civil rights and democracy, to cooperate with the Communist Party. He asserted that civil war must not be fought again. Zhang also stated, "If the government does not convene the National Assembly in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Democratic League will never participate. We believe that the solemn resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must not be destroyed."

    政协决议不容摧毁
    民盟绝不参加国大
    【新华社北平十八日电】民盟主席张澜十二日在渝接见记者时曾称：“民盟人士非热中于作官，在团结民主和平大局未定之前，民盟也不希望政府特别青眼看待。”张氏主张一党专政应该结束，国民党应改良政治彻底实行三民主义，以实行民权民主两大主义的诚意来与共产党合作，内战绝不容再打下去。张氏又称：“政府不依照政协决议召开国大，民盟绝不参加，我们认为庄严的政协决议不容摧毁。”
