Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Tokyo dispatch: Ito, a spokesperson for the Japanese Communist Party, stated yesterday that Stalin's peace declaration had shocked the Japanese reactionaries. He highly praised the statements of Wallace and Eden, saying, "The Japanese Communist Party supports the statements of Wallace and Eden, which echo Stalin's declaration." Ito continued, "Stalin's declaration cannot yet prevent the new war hoped for by the Japanese reactionaries. Only the united struggle of the Japanese people and the people of the Allied countries can stop the reactionaries' conspiracy. He advocated the rapid establishment of democracy in Japan, which is of great significance for preventing war. "Akahata," the Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, published an editorial on the 25th, declaring, "The poll of Kyushu miners shows that the call for the Yoshida Cabinet is very broad. The miners expressed 100% dissatisfaction with this cabinet in the anonymous ballot." It also stated, "Only when the Yoshida Cabinet steps down immediately will the Japanese people have a way out. Today's situation tells people what a terrible situation Japan will fall into as a result of the restriction of democratic forces!" Finally, it said, "The shadow of war is looming again, let the Japanese people rise up and extinguish it!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: United Press, London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Bevin told his constituents in Windworth on the evening of the 27th that he agreed with Stalin that another war would not occur at present. He said, "He does not know of anyone asking for war. If peace is to be sought, one war must be stopped, and that is the war of nerves, which has put some people in a state of harassment." He also said, "I think there have been some excited and prejudiced debates in the past." Regarding the work of the peace conference, Bevin said: The peace conference is trying to resolve the five major treaties, and hopes to end this work next week. He hopes that this work will be successfully completed and will include agreements with Germany and Austria.

　　日共发言人谈称
    斯大林的和平声明使日本反动派震惊
    贝文同意目前不会有战争
    【新华社延安二十八日电】东京讯：日本共产党发言人伊藤昨日发表谈话，指出斯大林的和平声明，使日本反动派为之震惊。渠对华莱士及艾登声明备极赞扬说：“日共拥护华莱士和艾登的声明，这些声明是与斯大林声明先后辉映”。伊藤继称：“斯大林的声明还不能防止日本反动派所寄望的新大战，必须日本人民与同盟国家人民的一致奋起，才能制止反动者的阴谋。渠主张在日本尽速建立民主，这对于防止战争是有很大意义的。日本共产党机关报“赤旗”于二十五日发表社论宣称：“九州矿工的民意测验，表明了对吉田内阁的呼声是十分广泛的，矿工在不记名的票上百分之百的对这一内阁表示不满。”又称：“只有吉田内阁即时下台，日本人民才有出路。今天的情势告诉人们，日本民主势力受到限制的结果，日本将走上怎样可怕的绝境啊！”最后说：“战争的阴影又在摇现，日本人民起来扑灭它吧！”
    【新华社延安二十八日电】合众社伦敦讯：英外相贝文二十七日晚在温德渥斯向其选民说：他同意斯大林所说另一次战争在目前是不会有的。他说：“渠不知道有任何人要求战争，若要求得和平，有一种战争必须停止，这就是神经战争，这种战争已使某些人陷入一种骚扰的状态中。”又说：“我以为过去有过一些激动与偏见的争辩。”关于和会工作，贝文说：和会正试图解决五大和约，下一周希望能结束此工作。他希望此次工作胜利结束，并能包括与德奥的协定。
