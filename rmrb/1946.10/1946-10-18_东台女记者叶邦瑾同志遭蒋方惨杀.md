    Comrade Ye Bangjin Brutally Murdered by the Chiang Faction
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dongtai, 15th] Comrade Ye Bangjin, a female reporter from the Xinhua News Agency's Dongtai branch, was unfortunately captured by Chiang's army in Chaiwan, Rugao, on August 10th. Chiang's army used all kinds of threats and inducements, and tortured her to force her to confess, but she sternly refused. She gloriously sacrificed herself at the end of August. Before her execution, Comrade Ye said with gritted teeth: "I am working for the liberation of the people, and tens of millions of people will avenge me." And shouted: "The Self-Defense War will surely be victorious, Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" and other slogans. Comrade Bangjin was a native of Juegang, Subei, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, 23 years old, and served as a reporter for this agency and the Jianghai Daily.
