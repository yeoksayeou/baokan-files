Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 14th—Liu Antai, the regiment commander of the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 12th Division of the Kuomintang's 96th Army, who laid down his arms in the battle of Lingshan north of Jimo, is being treated for his injuries by the Eighth Route Army medical staff. Liu greatly admired the Eighth Route Army's mobile warfare, combined command, courageous assaults, and accurate shooting. He said, "As soon as the battle started, our radio station was destroyed by artillery shells, and every shell hit its target." Speaking of the close mutual assistance between the military and civilians he observed in the liberated areas, he said, "This is the key to the defeat of the Kuomintang army." Regiment Commander Liu is a native of Maocun, Laiyang. He joined the Kuomintang army in 1940 and served as a battalion commander and regimental commander in the 68th Division of the 100th Army. He was transferred to Jiaodong in August of this year to assume his current position.
Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 14th—More than 800 officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang's Independent 10th Division, who were captured in the Zouping campaign, have safely arrived in the rear and are receiving preferential treatment. Yu Yeli, commander of the Binhai Military Region, met with them at his residence a few days ago to reassure them, saying, "Don't be afraid, everyone. We treat you as friends, and the treatment in all aspects is the same as ours. If you wish to return to your original unit or go home, we will provide travel expenses and send you out of the liberated area." He also inquired if they had any concerns. At that time, Xu Lejin, the communications battalion commander of the Independent 10th Division, and Zhang Jifu, the special service battalion commander of the division, both expressed their gratitude for our preferential treatment of their brothers. Now every captured officer and soldier has taken a bath, had a haircut, put on clean clothes, and is living a happy and comfortable life.

　　胶东放下武器蒋军团长
    盛赞我军机动作战
    【新华社莱阳十四日电】即墨以北灵山战斗中放下武器之蒋军九十六军暂编十二师一团团长刘安泰，正由八路军医务人员为其治疗伤痕。刘氏对八路军机动作战联合指挥勇猛冲锋及射击准确甚为钦佩。彼称：“战斗一开始，我们电台即被炮弹炸毁，每弹皆中目标。”谈及到解放区所见军民亲切互助的关系谓：“这就是国民党军失败的关键。”刘团长系莱阳毛村人，于民国二十九年参加国民党部队，曾任一百军六十八师营长团长等职，今年八月调胶东任该职。
    【新华社惠民十四日电】邹平战役中被俘之蒋军独十师官兵八百余已安抵后方，备受优待。滨海军区虞也烈司令员特于日前在驻地接见，安慰他们说：“大家不要害怕，我们把你们当作朋友看待，各方面待遇都和我们一样。你们如果愿回原部或返家，就发给路费，送你们出解放区。”并垂询有无什么顾虑。当时独十师通讯营营长徐乐金和该师特务营营长张吉甫都对我们对他们弟兄们的优待表示感谢。现每个被俘官兵都已洗澡理发，整洁服装，过着愉快安适的生活。
