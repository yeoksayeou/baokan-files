Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 4th. This morning, just after 6 o'clock, on the bulletin board across from the Xin Zhangjiakou Daily newspaper building on Dong'an Street, an announcement of victory appeared, stating that the Eighth Route Army annihilated over 3,000 Chiang troops on the night of the 3rd at the Huailai front. The ink was barely dry on the newsprint. It spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, quickly gathering thousands of citizens and workers. Under the golden morning sunlight, countless heads moved, silent and still, as they listened to a worker-like person standing at the front loudly read the victory announcement. His reading was repeatedly drowned out by waves of cheers. An auto repair worker patted his chest and said to those around him, "It's more comfortable than taking a digestive pill! Just wait and see, if that bad egg Chiang Kai-shek attacks again, he'll suffer an even greater loss than this!" Another old man with snow-white eyebrows muttered, "Chiang Kai-shek is too crazy. Zhangjiakou is a world-famous city of the people. Does he think it's easy to touch?!" Gentry councilor Li Xiwu pointed out in public: "Chiang Kai-shek releases peaceful overtures on one hand while intensifying his attack on Zhangjiakou on the other. Only when the military and civilians of the liberated areas smash his head with iron hammers can we talk about restoring peace." Mass organizations from the Sixth District specially drew two situation maps of the great victories of the People's Liberation Army’s self-defense counterattacks on the Pinghan and Pingsui fronts, parading them through the streets, giving explanations, with over a thousand citizens following behind. Upon hearing the news of the victory, citizens from various streets in the Second District competed to write letters of condolence to the soldiers at the front, collecting over 180 letters in a short time. The front-line celebration and慰问团organized by people from all walks of life, raised more than 7,000 jin of wine, 2,000 jin of soy sauce, 500 jin of sesame oil, and a large quantity of Hong Kong canned goods that afternoon. In the evening, they took the night train to the Huailai front to support the troops.

　　张垣万众争观捷报
    各界驰赴前线劳军
    【新华社张家口四日电】今日上午六点多钟，东安大街新张家口报社大楼对面的贴报牌上，出现了怀来前线八路军三日晚歼灭蒋军三千余人的捷报，白报纸上墨迹未干，一传十，十传百，就聚起了千百市民工人，只见金黄的朝阳光辉下，无数的人头钻动，肃静无声，听着站在最前面的一个工人模样的路人大声朗读捷报，他的朗读不时为欢呼声浪所湮没。一个汽车修理工人拍着胸脯对周围的人说：“真比吃了顺气丸还舒贴，等着瞧吧，蒋介石坏小子如果再进攻时，还得吃比这更大的亏呢！”另一个眉须雪白的老人喃喃地说：“蒋介石也太疯狂了，张家口是全世界出名的人民的城市，这是好碰的！？”士绅参议员李锡文当众指出：“蒋介石一面放出和平空气，一面加紧进攻张家口，只有解放区军民用铁锤击破他的头，才谈得上恢复和平。”六区各群众团体特地画了两张平汉、平绥前线子弟兵自卫反击大捷的形势图，游遍各街，进行讲解，千余市民跟随其后。二区各街市民闻捷后争相写慰问信给前方健儿，片刻即收集了一百八十余封。各界人士组织的前线祝捷慰问团，当日下午募捐了七千多斤酒，二千斤酱油，五百斤香油，以及大宗香港罐头，于傍晚搭夜车开赴怀来前线劳军。
