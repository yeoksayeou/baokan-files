Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Shanghai dispatch: Markets are universally depressed in the Chiang-controlled areas. The actual rise in prices has reached more than ten thousand times that of the first half of 1937. The market price of US dollars is now around 4,000 yuan, exceeding the official price increased in August. The issuance of "legal tender" exceeds 10 billion per day. It is widely believed that by the end of this year it will reach 20 trillion yuan. The legal tender in the hands of the people is constantly depreciating, and its purchasing power is at an unprecedented low. Business is very sluggish in major department stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. In order to protect the business of large companies, the municipal government banned street vendors in August. The Chiang government's civil war military transport monopolizes water and land transportation between Shanghai and the inland, and goods cannot be transported smoothly, which is another reason for the commercial depression. Due to the sluggish business, many shops have closed down. There were originally more than 1,000 cotton cloth shops, but now there are only more than 400 left. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the money market was extremely tight, and more than 70 shops closed down again. In Chongqing, the commercial situation was described by the Southwest Daily on September 10th as: the first is depression, the second is depression, and the third still cannot but be depression. A large number of local products cannot be transported out, medicinal materials are piled up and rotted, and dumped into the river, and more than 10,000 tons of tung oil are also piled up. All cities such as Kunming, Chengdu, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Beiping, and Tianjin are in a deep recession. Merchants are desperately "reducing prices," but goods cannot be sold. In Hangzhou, famous for its silk, fifty or sixty silk shops have closed down, accounting for a quarter of the silk shops in the area; fifty-three cloth shops have closed down. The situation is even more serious in areas close to the war. More than 80 businesses have closed in Qingdao, more than 30 in Xuzhou, and 70% of businesses in Jinan have closed. In Xinpu, Jiangsu, more than ten grocery stores, department stores, and cloth shops closed during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Several stores were forcibly prevented from closing by the Chiang government, claiming that it would "affect the appearance of the city," so they had to dismiss shop assistants and tighten their expenses. However, with no income and only expenses, their suffering is even greater than those who have already closed down. Import and speculation businesses are booming as never before. American goods have further poured from Ping, Tianjin, Yu, and Kun and other places into small and medium-sized cities, and American cigarettes, combs, and the like have reached places such as Longchang in Sichuan. In addition to already monopolizing finance, foreign exchange, and import businesses, the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen financial groups have recently monopolized exports. Chiang's four banks and the China Silk Company are purchasing autumn cocoons at low prices in order to export raw silk to supply the United States for the manufacture of parachutes. At the same time, they are transporting large quantities of yarn and cloth to the south for sale to Southeast Asia, and prohibit small and medium-sized capitalists from transporting yarn and cloth abroad (only the China Textile Construction Company is an exception), which has aroused fierce opposition from Shanghai industrialists and merchants.

　　蒋管区市场普遍萧条
    蒋宋孔陈财团垄断金融外汇进出口
    法币每日发行百万万物价高涨万倍
    【新华社延安十五日电】沪讯：蒋管区各地市场普遍萧条，物价的高涨实际上已达一九三七年上半年的万倍以上。美金市价现为四千元左右，已超过八月提高的官价。“法币”的发行，每日超过一百亿。众信今年年底将达到二十万亿元。人民手里的法币，不断贬值，购买力空前低落。上海南京路上各大百货公司的营业，十分冷落。为了保护大公司的生意，市府于八月间取缔了摊贩。蒋政府的内战军运，垄断了上海与内地的水陆交通，货物无法顺利的运输，是商业萧条的另一个原因。由于生意萧条，许多商店倒闭了。棉布商店原有一千多家，现只剩了四百多家。中秋前后，银根奇紧，又倒了七十多家。在重庆的商业，西南日报九月十日描写道：第一是萧条，第二是萧条，第三仍然不能不是萧条。大量出品土产运不出去，药材堆烂了推入江心，桐油也堆积了一万多吨。所有昆明成都西安广州武汉北平天津等都市都陷入深刻的不景气中。商人拚命的“大减价”，但货物卖不出去，以丝绸著名的杭州，绸庄已倒闭了五六十家，占该地绸庄四分之一；布庄倒闭了五十三家。接近战争的地区，情况更加严重。商号歇业者，青岛达八十多家，徐州三十多家，济南则占该地商号百分之七十，江苏的新浦在中秋节关倒闭杂货店百货店布庄达十余家。好几家的货店被蒋政府强制不准关门，说是“有碍市容”，只好辞雇店员，紧缩开支。但营业有出无进，其痛苦更甚于已歇业者。进口和投机事业，则空前兴旺。美国货物已进一步从平、津、渝、昆等地涌至中小城市，美国香烟梳子等类已经到了四川隆昌等地。蒋、宋、孔、陈财团，除了已经垄断了金融外汇进口等事业外，最近又垄断着出口。蒋记四行和中国蚕丝公司正在以低价收购秋茧，以便出口生丝供给美国制造降落伞。同时他们又将大批纱布南运，销至南洋，并禁止中小资本家将纱布外运（只中国纺织建设公司例外），后者已引起上海工商业者的激烈反对。
