On the Achievements of the Paris Peace Conference
    Liberation Daily Special Article
    The first peace conference after the victory of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression war, which lasted two and a half months, closed yesterday (the 15th). The goals that the Allied countries strived for during the war—eliminating fascism and punishing acts of aggression—have been recorded as peace treaties in the new world's history. This is a victory for the solidarity of the Allied countries led by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and a victory for the peace-loving people of the world.
    As everyone knows, the Paris Peace Conference after the First World War was a plunder and spoils-sharing conference for the victorious countries at the expense of the defeated countries. For this reason, it not only failed to eliminate war, but also became the tinder for the Second World War. The second Paris Peace Conference has a completely different nature. It is a conference of the victors of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression war. It is a conference with the participation of the Soviet Union as one of the leading powers. It is a conference in a new era where the level of awareness of the people of the world (including the people of the defeated countries) has been unprecedentedly enhanced.
    The task of the Paris Peace Conference was to be responsible for handling the draft treaty proposals for the former enemy countries of Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and important decisions such as the reparations plans of Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland to the Soviet Union. When these drafts are finally submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers for review, the five-nation treaties will become official.
    The Paris Peace Conference experienced serious struggles when passing the Foreign Ministers' recommendations on the draft treaties. The two lines of the post-war world are the basic reasons for the emergence of this struggle. One line, proceeding from safeguarding the interests of imperialism, attempts to change or even overturn the Moscow, Yalta, and Potsdam international agreements, implement an expansionist policy, and condone the remnants of fascism, with the United States government as its representative. The other line, proceeding from safeguarding the interests of the people of the world, demands peace and democracy, demands the implementation of the decisions of previous international conferences, and eradicates fascism, with the Soviet government as its representative. As is well known, during this conference, the American representatives used many "tactics" and "strategies" both inside and outside the conference in an attempt to force other countries to accept the American propositions in the conference. First, in the initial debate on the rules of procedure of the conference, the American representatives tried their best to manipulate the conference and instigated the passage of voting rules that violated the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers (that is, a majority of two-thirds of the votes was not required, but rather a simple majority of one-half would suffice to pass a motion), pretending to safeguard the interests of small countries, but actually seeking to control the conference by securing a majority vote. By doing so, they would monopolize the meeting. By using his position as chairman, Byrnes even tried to prevent Molotov from speaking. Second, when the conference entered the committee activities, the Vandenberg-Byrnes group launched a "joint offensive" inside and outside the conference. Inside the conference, the American representatives played with the "collapse strategy" and "delaying tactics," and put forward a large number of amendments through their agents. The Australian representative alone put forward 77 amendments (accounting for 35 percent of all amendments). As a result of this obstruction of "no proposal without amendment" and "amending for the sake of amending," the progress of the conference was as slow as a snail's pace. In one month, only six and a half pages of the 92-page draft treaty were discussed. In seven weeks, only a quarter of the 250 amendments were discussed. When the conference was "amended" and "delayed," the American representatives incited the representatives of certain countries to demand the adjournment of the conference. All of these were aimed at turning the conference into a talk shop with endless disputes. Outside the conference, during this period, the United States launched a series of pre-arranged "diplomatic offensives," the most prominent of which were the announcement on August 17 that the U.S. military and the Southern Army in the Istrian region were in a state of semi-belligerence, the note issued on the 19th interfering in Poland's internal affairs, the "tough" note sent to the Soviet Union on the 21st regarding the Dardanelles Strait issue, the U.S. fleet led by the Roosevelt aircraft carrier entered the Mediterranean on the 22nd, and the ultimatum sent to Yugoslavia on the 20th. This series of "offensives" was a mixture of "needle-prick diplomacy" and "gunboat diplomacy," aimed at "intimidating" the representatives of many countries in the conference who insisted on opposing the American "power politics," so that they would make concessions to the United States. Third, when the Trieste issue became the center of debate at the conference, Byrnes avoided the near and sought the far, creating extraneous issues, and personally went to Stuttgart, Germany, to deliver a speech that pleased the remnants of German fascism.
    In short, from the beginning of the conference to the beginning of September, the Vandenberg-Byrnes group stirred up many storms inside and outside the conference, and the Stuttgart speech can be said to be the climax. These plans were obviously closely related to the American imperialists' active support for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war during this period, MacArthur's anti-Soviet and anti-democratic remarks and deeds in Tokyo, and the clamor of reactionary elements in the United States about the "Third World War." The manifestation of American imperialist expansion policy during this period was more blatant than it had been since the end of the war. The planning in the conference was an important link in this policy.
    However, what were the results of the Byrnes-Vandenberg group's strategies inside and outside the conference?
    One of the most obvious results was that the conference delegates were immersed in the "long night meetings" that lasted even 29 hours in the later period, and they were exhausted and complained. However, one of the most important results was that the true colors of American imperialism were exposed nakedly during this period. The "peace and democracy," "open door," and "equal opportunity" that the Byrnes-Vandenberg group had boasted about could no longer deceive people, and could no longer conceal the essence of its ugly expansionist policy. Therefore, the tricks played by Byrnes and Vandenberg inside and outside the conference were met with fierce opposition from all sides. Yugoslavia was not intimidated by the U.S. authorities' ultimatum. She sternly rejected the U.S. ultimatum, and her representatives at the conference made repeated efforts to strive for a reasonable solution to the Italian-Yugoslav border and the Free Territory of Trieste, and persevered to the end without wavering. The Soviet Union became the most resolute opponent of the Byrnes-Vandenberg policy. Her conference representatives, Molotov and Vyshinsky, successfully upheld the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers on the issues of Soviet compensation from Italy, Romania, and Finland, and the Italian-Yugoslav border, and thwarted the conspiracy to delay the conference. At the same time, on the issues of voting rules, the legal system of the Free Territory of Trieste, the Danube River, and the Greek-Albanian border, they sharply exposed the essence of the proposals of the American and British representatives, and repeatedly and steadfastly opposed these plans that violated the principles of previous international agreements and the interests of the people of the world, and even declared to the end that they would continue to oppose them to the end. This indomitable spirit greatly undermined the arrogance of the Byrnes-Vandenberg group, encouraged the world's democratic forces to fight for the cause of peace, and powerfully promoted the major achievements of the conference. In addition, it is particularly worth pointing out that Stalin's statement on the current situation swept away the clouds of "new war" that shrouded the world political stage, dealt a head-on blow to those "atomic diplomats," and reiterated the belief in international cooperation, and in particular, mentioned the possibility of improving British-Soviet relations. This statement had a significant impact on the development of the conference.
    The policies of the Byrnes-Vandenberg group were also widely opposed by American democrats. As early as August, when the conference was making slow progress, American public opinion was deeply dissatisfied, and when Byrnes delivered his Stuttgart speech (September 6), it erupted into a surging wave of opposition. Wallace's speech on September 12 was its symbol. This wave of opposition impacted all aspects of American imperialist expansion policy. The "Get Out of China" movement week held in 35 major cities was one of them, and the demand to change the policy at the Paris Peace Conference was also one of them.
    The above-mentioned chorus of opposition inside and outside the conference constituted a huge pressure, forcing the arrogance and arbitrariness of Byrnes and Vandenberg and their ilk to disappear, and allowing the conference to finally tend to solve the problem in the later stage. The plans of the American imperialists inside and outside the conference were mostly bankrupt.
    In addition to the above factors, when reviewing the achievements of the conference, we cannot ignore the attitude of Britain during this period. The British government, led by the right wing of the Labour Party, basically agreed with the United States on the main controversial issues in the draft treaties of the five countries at the conference, because these issues involved the vital interests of the British Empire in the pre-war Balkans, or the Mediterranean Sea, which was regarded as a British inland sea. The British authorities cannot forget about restoring the old forces in these regions. It will naturally not refuse to stand with the United States on these issues. Even Britain, which was greatly weakened in the war, is eager to restore exports and maintain its colonial empire. Apart from this, it is unwilling to get entangled in international diplomatic wars for a long time, so as to consume energy and miss the time. Moreover, under the banner of common anti-democracy, the United States is infiltrating the British sphere of influence. It sent a fleet to the Mediterranean Sea, which has always been considered by Americans to be "Britain's inland sea." Therefore, the London "Observer" (one of the mouthpieces of the British bourgeoisie) worried on August 25: "After 250 years of dominating the Mediterranean, Britain has lost its position for the first time in the past few months and has been replaced by the United States." At the same time, Britain's position in Palestine is also facing a crisis due to the active intrusion of the United States. On the other hand, the 160 million U.S. dollar British-Soviet commercial contract established in early September has opened up a mutually beneficial export market for Britain, which shows the possibility of continuing to improve British-Soviet friendly relations. Therefore, Britain does not quite approve of the delay in the five-nation treaties, or even the excessive tension in the international situation. British Foreign Secretary Bevin became the initiator of several meetings of foreign ministers to promote the work of the conference. The British and Indian representatives repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the conference. Bevin also agreed to and participated in the request to postpone the convening of the UN General Assembly so that the conference could end before it was convened. These are all contrary to Byrnes' attitude.
    In general, the Paris Peace Conference was a success. It almost completely passed the draft recommendations of the Foreign Ministers' Council on the treaties of the five countries, and most of the amendments were rejected. Naturally, the conference was not without its shortcomings. For example, the plans passed on the Trieste legal system, the Danube River, and the Greek-Albanian border are not conducive to peace. These plans will undoubtedly become the center of debate at the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' meeting to be held in New York next month. To change this plan, further efforts from the world's democrats are still needed. However, even with these shortcomings, the achievements of the conference are of great historical significance. The experience of the conference proves that the world's trend of peace and democracy is irresistible. Although American imperialists tried to revise the resolutions of the Foreign Ministers' Council, tried to overthrow the principles of the decisions of international conferences such as Moscow, Yalta, and Potsdam, tried to oppress the emerging democratic forces in Southeast Europe, and played various tricks, the people of the world won peace and insisted on fighting for the establishment and consolidation of democratic peace. Peace and democracy have established these principles in the decisions of the Moscow, Yalta, San Francisco, and Potsdam conferences. It is the result of the growth of the great power of the people of the world. Now these forces not only still exist, but are even stronger. This is the basic reason for the achievements of this conference.

　　论巴黎和会的成就
    解放日报专论
    反法西斯、反侵略战争胜利之后的首次和平会议，历时两月半，已于昨日（十五日）闭幕。盟国在战时奋力以求的目标——消灭法西斯主义，惩罚侵略行为，已作为和平条约载入新世界的史册中。这是以苏美英为首的盟国团结的胜利，这是爱好和平的世界人民的胜利。
    尽人皆知，第一次世界大战后的巴黎和会，是一次战胜国抢掠战败国的强盗分赃会议，基于这种原因，它不但没有消灭战争，而且成了第二次战争的引火物。第二次巴黎和会具有完全不同的性质，这是反法西斯、反侵略战争胜利者的和会，这是有苏联参加、并作为领导强国之一的和会，这是世界人民（包括战败国的人民在内）觉悟程度空前提高的新时代的和会。
    此次巴黎和会的任务，是负责处理前敌国意、罗、保、匈、芬的和约处理方案、意、罗、保、匈、芬对苏赔款方案等重要决定，当这些草案最后提交四强外长会议审核之后，五国和约就将成为正式的了。
    巴黎和会在通过外长会议关于和约草案的建议时，曾经历了严重的斗争。战后世界的两条路线，是这种斗争产生的基本原因。一条路线，从维护帝国主义的利益出发，企图变更、甚至于推翻莫斯科、雅尔塔与波茨顿等国际协定，施行扩张政策，纵容法西斯残余，这以美国政府为其代表。一条路线，从保卫世界人民的利益出发，要求和平民主，要求贯彻历次国际会议决定，根绝法西斯，这以苏联政府为其代表。如众所周知，美国代表在这次和会期间，在会内会外曾使用了多次的“权术”和“策略”，企图压迫其他国家在和会中接受美国的主张。第一、在和会初期辩论程序规则时，美国代表曾竭力试图一手操纵和会，策动通过违反外长会议决议的表决规则（即有二分之一而不是三分之二的赞成票，即可通过议案），假维护小国利益之名，而行要弄多数票以垄断和会之宝。贝纳斯甚至利用当主席职权，企图制止莫洛托夫发言。第二、当和会进入委员会活动时，范登堡——贝纳斯集团在和会内外发动“联合攻势”，在会内美国代表玩弄“倒坍策略”和“拖延战术”，通过其代理人提出一大堆修正案，其中仅澳洲代表就提了七十七件修正案（占全部修正案的百分之三十五），因之在这种“无案不修正”，“为修正而修正”的阻挠下，和会进展有如蜗牛之爬行，在一个月中，只讨论了长达九十二页的和约草案中的六页半；在七个星期内，只讨论了二百五十件修正案中的四分之一。当“修正”“拖延”了和会时，美国代表便又唆使某些国家的代表，要求和会休会。所有这些，其目的在于使和会变成争论不休的清谈机关。在会外，这一时期内，美国发动了一连串的预先布置的“外交攻势”，其荦荦大者，有八月十七日宣布伊斯特利亚区美军与南军处于半交战状态，十九日发出干涉波兰内政的照会，二十一日向苏联提出关于达达尼尔海峡问题的“强硬”照会，二十二日以罗斯福号航空母舰为首的美舰队开入地中海，二十日向南斯拉夫提出最后通牒。这一连串的“攻势”，是“针刺外交”和“武力外交”的混合物，为的是想“恫吓”和会中坚持反对美国“强权政策”的许多国家的代表，使他们对美国让步。第三、当的里雅斯特问题成为和会争论中心时，贝纳斯则避近就远，节外生枝，亲自跑到德国斯图加特去，发表了一篇讨好德国法西斯残余的演说。
    总之，从和会开始到九月上旬，范登堡——贝纳斯集团在和会内外，掀起了许多风波，斯图加特的演讲，可以说是最高潮。这些策划，显然是在这个时期内，美帝国主义积极援蒋内战、麦克阿瑟在东京的反苏反民主言行，以及美国国内反动分子关于“第三次世界大战”的喧嚷，都是有密切联系的。这个时期内，美帝国主义扩张政策的表现，其露骨为战争结束以来所未有。和会中的策划，就是这个政策中的一个重要环节。
    然而，贝纳斯——范登堡集团在和会内外的谋略，得到什么结果呢？
    最浅显的结果之一，是使和会代表们在后期沉溺于甚至连续二十九个钟头的“长夜会议”，疲倦不堪，怨声载道。然而，最重要的结果之一，则是美帝国主义的原形在这一时期内赤裸裸的暴露出来了。贝纳斯——范登堡集团所侈言的什么“和平民主”、“门户开放”、“机会均等”，再也骗不了人，再也不能掩饰其丑恶的扩张政策的实质了。因此，贝纳斯、范登堡在和会内外所玩的一套，受到各方面的猛烈反对。南斯拉夫并没有被美国当局的最后通牒所吓倒，她严正地拒绝了美国的通牒，她的代表在和会上为意南边界及的里雅斯特自由区的合理解决而再接再厉的奋斗，一直坚持到最后，毫不动摇。苏联成了贝纳斯——范登堡政策的最坚决的反对者，她的和会代表莫洛托夫和维辛斯基，在意罗芬对苏赔偿、意南边界等问题上，胜利地坚持了外长会议的决定，并挫败了使和会拖延下去的阴谋。同时，在表决规则、的里雅斯特自由区法制、多瑙河、希保边境等问题上，又尖锐地揭发了美英代表提案的本质，并一而再，再而三地坚定不移地反对这些违反历次国际协议的原则，违反世界人民利益的方案，一直到最后，仍声言将继续反对到底。这种百折不挠的精神，大大地打击了贝纳斯——范登堡集团的气焰，鼓舞世界民主势力为和平事业而奋斗，有力地促进和会的重大成就。此外，特别值得指出的，是斯大林关于时局的声明，一扫而空了笼罩世界政治舞台的“新战争”的云雾，给那些“原子外交家”当头一棒，并重申国际合作的信念，其中特别提到了英苏关系改进的可能。这一声明对和会的发展，有重大影响。
    贝纳斯、范登堡集团的政策，也受到了美国国内民主人士的广泛反对，早在和会蹒跚不前的八月中，美国舆论已深为不满，及至贝纳斯斯图加特演说（九月六日）后，即爆发为澎湃一时的反对浪潮。九月十二日的华莱士演说，即为其标志。这一反对浪潮，冲击着美帝国主义扩张政策的各个方面，三十五个主要城市举行“退出中国”运动周是其一，要求改变在巴黎和会的政策，也是其中之一。
    上述这些和会内外的一片反对声，构成了一个巨大的压力，迫使贝纳斯、范登堡辈的嚣张专横不能不消形敛迹，使和会终于在后期趋向于解决问题。美帝国主义在和会内外的计划，大部都破产了。
    除了上述这些因素外，检讨和会的成就时，还不能忽视在此期间英国的态度。以工党右派为首的英国政府，在和会上对于五国和约草案中的几个主要争论问题的意见，基本上仍和美国一致，因为这些问题牵涉到战前英帝国是重大利益的巴尔干，或是被视为英国内海的地中海，英国当局对于恢复这些地区中的旧势力，是不能忘怀的，它自然不会拒绝在这些问题上和美国站在一起，就是在战争中大大削弱了的英国急于恢复输出和维系殖民地帝国。除此以外，它不愿在国际外交战中长此纠缠不休，以致消耗精力，错过时日。况且美国在共同反民主的标榜下，正渗入英国的势力范围，它开了一个舰队到地中海，这个海一向是被美国人认为是“英国的内海”的，所以伦敦“观察家报”（英国资产阶级喉古之一）于八月二十五日曾忧虑地说：“英国于掌握地中海霸权二百五十年之后，在过去数月中，已首次丧失其地位，被美国取而代之了。”同时，英国在巴勒斯坦的地位，亦因美国的积极侵入而面临危机。而在另一方面，九月初成立的一万万六千万美元的英苏商业合同，却为英国开辟一个互惠有利的出口市场，这显示英苏友谊关系继续改善的可能性，因此英国对五国和约的拖延不决，甚或形成国际局势过分紧张，是不大赞成的。英外相贝文成了促进和会工作的几次外长会议的倡议人，英印代表均曾一再表示不满和会进展迟缓。贝文也是赞成并参加要求联合国大会延期召开，以便和会能在其召开之前结束的。这些都是和贝纳斯态度相反的。
    总的来说，巴黎和会是成功的，它差不多完全通过了外长会议关于五国和约的建议草案，而大部分的修正案都被否决了。自然，和会不是没有缺点的，例如在的里雅斯特法制、多瑙河及希保边界等问题上所通过的方案，是无益于和平的。这些方案，无疑将成为下月在纽约举行的四强外长会议的争论中心。要变更这方案，仍须全世界民主人士进一步的努力。但是，即使有这些缺点，和会的成就乃具有重大的历史意义。和会的经验证明，世界和平民主潮流是不可抗拒的，尽管美国帝国主义分子企图修改外长会议的决议，企图推翻莫斯科、雅尔塔、波茨顿等国际会议的决定的原则，企图压迫东南欧的新兴民主势力，并耍弄了各种各样的谋略，但是世界人民赢得了和平，并为建立和巩固民主的和平而坚持奋斗。和平民主在莫斯科、雅尔塔、旧金山、波茨顿等会议的决定中，确定了这些原则，是世界人民伟大力量生长的成果，现在这些力量不但依然存在，而且更强大了，这是这次和会获得成就的基本原因。
