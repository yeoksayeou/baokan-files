　　Unify Thinking First, Then Evaluate Grades
　　West Sparrow Village Distributes Fruits, Everyone is Happy
　　Reasonable Mutual Concessions, Most Farmers Benefit
　　[This newspaper, Changzhi News] West Sparrow Village in Shahe has created a model for unifying the masses' thinking in distributing the fruits of struggle. Eighty-three percent of the households in the village received fruits, and everyone was happy. Before the distribution, a farmers' association members' meeting was held to discuss three questions: "Why did the struggle succeed, how were the fruits obtained, and how should they be distributed?" Poor peasant Li Shulin said, "Turning over depends on everyone, it can't be done by one person alone. Everyone contributes and everyone enjoys. I only need land to cultivate, that's enough for food and clothing." Middle peasant Li Xiaojian said, "The poor peasants were exploited the most severely and went hungry. They should be given things first. Although I have also been oppressed, I have already vented my anger. I have food and clothing now, I don't need anything." After discussion, everyone agreed that Li Shulin's words were correct, as long as you have land to cultivate, you have everything. The mother of Anti-Japanese soldier Li Yude originally wanted more things for him, but after Yude explained, her thinking was also straightened out. She said, "The government has given me preferential treatment every year in the past few years, I can't ask for extra things!" After unifying their thinking, the conference elected 17 people to form an evaluation committee, responsible for the specific distribution. First, all the fruits were announced to the masses, and then they were divided into four categories according to each household's situation: families of revolutionary soldiers, extremely poor, poor peasants, and middle peasants. Then, each household told the evaluation committee what they needed to register. After joint discussion by the evaluation committee members, they evaluated what each household should receive. Finally, a mass meeting was held to announce the results for approval. If there was anything unsuitable, it was adjusted through democratic discussion on the spot. As a result, 160 out of 194 households in the village received fruits.
　　[This newspaper, Zanhuang News] Under the leadership of Ren Zhongyi, director of the Farmers' Association, the masses in the North Street of Zanhuang City have now overthrown five traitors and evil landlords who relied on enemy power to oppress the masses: An Changgeng, An Mingchao, Ren Laoguan, Ren Lin, and Zhang Xiaoheng. Their rule was politically crushed, and more than 200 mu of land, 137 houses, 3 head of livestock, and more than 1 million yuan were recovered. Of the 142 households in the street, 113 received fruits, and all 11 extremely poor households have been elevated to middle peasants and prosperous middle peasants. An Zeng's family of six used to have only one mu of land, and during the New Year, they had to borrow sorghum flour from others to cook porridge, and could not even afford small businesses; now they not only have a fruit shop earning more than 1,000 yuan per day on average, but have also become middle peasants with 11 mu of land. An Mihe's family of six used to rely entirely on renting land to make a living, and they had to go hungry every year after paying the rent, but now they have also become middle peasants with a good ten mu of land. The liberated masses are in high spirits and are continuing the struggle. (Zhang Gong)

　　先统一思想再评定等级
    西雀村分果实皆大欢喜
    合理互让，多数农户都得利
    【本报长治讯】沙河西雀村创造了统一群众思想分配斗争果实的范例，全村有百分之八十三的户口得到果实，皆大欢喜。分配前，曾召开农会会员大会，讨论“斗争为啥会胜利，果实是怎样得来的，应当应样分配”等三个问题。贫农李树林说：“翻身靠大家，光一个人可不行，大家出力大家享受，我只要有地种，就够吃穿了”，中农李孝俭说：“贫农们受剥削最厉害，挨了饿，应先分东西，我虽也受过压迫，但已出了怨气，我现在有吃穿，不要东西”，经过讨论，大家都认为李树林的话很对，只要有地种就有了一切。抗属李玉德的母亲原是要求给他多分东西，后经玉德解释，思想也打通了。她说：“前几年政府年年优待我，我也不能格外要东西呀！”思想上统一以后，大会上就选出了十七人组成评议会，负责具体分配。先把所有的果实向群众出表公布，然后按各家情况分成抗属、赤贫、贫农、中农四等，接着各户把自己需要的东西告诉评委会登记，经评议员共同讨论，评出各户应分之东西，最后开群众大会宣布通过，不合适的当场民主讨论调剂，结果全村一百九十四户中，一百六十户得到果实。
    【本报赞皇讯】赞皇城内北街群众在农会主任任忠义等领导下，现已斗倒依仗敌势欺压群众的汉奸恶霸地主安长更、安明朝、任老贯、任林、张小恒等五人。在政治上摧垮了他们的统治，并算回被掠夺的土地二百多亩，房子一百三十七间，牲口三头，钱百余万元。全街一百四十二户中得到果实的有一百一十三户，十一户赤贫已全部上升为中农与富裕中农。安增全家六口人，过去只有一亩地，年关时还借人家高粱面煮糊糊吃，连小买卖也干不起；现在不仅有每天平均赚一千余元的果子铺，还成了十一亩地的中农。安米合全家六口人，过去全靠租地度日，每年交了租子就得挨饿，现在也成了十好几亩地的中农了。翻了身的群众情绪很高，现正在继续斗争中。（张恭）
