　　【News from Jingxing from this newspaper】Under the call to carry out guerrilla warfare and strike the enemy everywhere, the Jingxing militia are bravely resisting the invading enemy with landmines, homemade rifles, and other weapons. On the 24th of last month, more than ten Chiang Kai-shek soldiers disturbed Liangdu Village and detonated two landmines planted by our militia, seriously injuring five. When the enemy retreated in a panic, carrying the wounded, the militia shouted from the mountains: "Good! Good!" The enemy was very angry and had no way to retaliate, and dared not disturb that area again. On the 5th of this month, more than sixty members of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent home-returning corps in two groups raided Wujia Kiln. As soon as they arrived at the Donghe Ditch in Douwang Village, they were driven away in headlong flight by two homemade cannons of the militia. The militia laughed and said, "They can't even withstand the militia's homemade cannons, and they still come to attack the liberated areas! When the Eighth Route Army comes with big cannons, let's see where you turtles roll to!" The masses were also extremely excited and automatically gave the militia a big fat sheep as a token of appreciation.

　　井陉民兵到处出击地雷土枪大败蒋伪
    【本报井陉讯】在开展游击战争，随处打击敌人的号召下，井陉民兵正以地雷土枪等英勇抗击进犯之敌人。上月廿四日，蒋军十余名出扰良都村，踏响我民兵安好的地雷两颗，重伤五人。当敌人背着伤者狼狈窜回时，民兵在山上高喊：“好呀！好呀！”。该敌人干气没办法，以后再不敢到那一带扰乱了。本月五日，蒋特还乡队六十多人分两路袭扰吴家窑，刚到豆王村东河沟处，即被民兵两土炮打的抱头鼠窜而去。民兵哈哈大笑说：“连民兵的土炮都吃不住，还来进攻解放区！八路军带大炮来了，看你们这些王八滚到哪儿去！”群众也极兴奋，自动慰劳给民兵一只大肥羊。
