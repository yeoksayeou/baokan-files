　　Democratic National Construction Army Dependents' School Produces and Donates to Support the Front Lines
    [Report from this newspaper] To welcome the anniversary of the Handan Uprising of the Democratic National Construction Army, the Dependents' School of the Democratic National Construction Army is stepping up spinning and weaving during after-school hours to donate the proceeds of production to the soldiers at the front. The Ministry has received fourteen letters of condolence and over 18,000 yuan in consolation money. Ms. Liu Xiuzhen, the principal of the school, sets an example by seizing after-school time to spin and weave day and night, and donating all the money earned from spinning and weaving to the soldiers at the front; seven dependents of the Fifth Regiment spun eight *jin* of cotton in one week of after-school time; Ms. Huang Bangwei (wife of Deputy Commander Liao), the vice-principal, unable to produce due to illness, donated a portion of her usual savings to the front. Currently, various units are adding spinning wheels, and all military dependents are about to be swept up in a wave of intensified production to support the front. (Luo Wei)
