Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: San Francisco dispatch: The American sailors' strike has ended victoriously. The Pacific Coast Maritime Union resumed work on the 26th, ending the largest strike in shipping history; the National Maritime Cooks and Stewards Union on the Atlantic Coast also won wage increases of $2.20 to $17.50 per person per month on the 25th. However, another shipping strike may break out next Monday, as marine technicians, captains, chief mates, and deckhands are demanding a 35% wage increase, otherwise they will begin a strike next week. These marine technicians are scattered on both the East and West Coasts, and their strike will affect shipping as seriously as the sailors' strike.

　　美海员罢工胜利结束
    航海技师船长等继起要求增资
    【新华社延安二十八日电】旧金山讯：美国海员大罢工已胜利结束。太平洋岸海员工会已于二十六日复工，结束了航运史上最大一次大罢工；大西洋岸的全国海员厨师膳务工会亦于二十五日争得每人每月增资二元二角至十七元五角。但又一次航运罢工有于下星期一爆发的可能，因航海技师船长大副船手等要求增资百分之三十五，否则将于下周开始罢工。此等航海技师分散于东西两岸，他们的罢工将和海员罢工一样严重影响航运。
