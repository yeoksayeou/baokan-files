Giving Chiang Kai-shek a "Birthday"
　　Chen Kong

The Chiang offspring within the Chiang-controlled areas are busy today (October 31st) preparing for Chiang Kai-shek's "60th Birthday". According to the Central News Agency, shops and households in Nanjing are ordered to hang flags to show "celebration". The New Life Movement Association, under the control of eunuchs, is "motivating" citizens to eat noodles for lunch, forcing noodle shops to sell longevity peaches and noodles at half price. They are also screening the film "Long Live the Leader." In Xinjiang, there are even talks of a "Birthday-Blessing Aircraft Dedication"… Enough! Truly magnificent!

Chiang Kai-shek, at this age when he should be facing death, instead of reflecting on his sins against the nation, the people, shamelessly demands that the people give him a "birthday", extorting money from the people to "dedicate aircraft" to slaughter them. To use his own favorite phrase, he is truly "no different from beasts" and "knows no propriety, justice, integrity, or shame".

Chiang Kai-shek's origins are unclear. Some suspect he is a mongrel. I think whether his stinking hide is a mongrel is a small matter. But looking at him as a political figure, it is necessary to examine his political lineage.

His political lineage is indeed an unadulterated mongrel, a fascist mixed-breed, born of comprador and feudal elements.

As Comrade Fan Wenlan said, his ancestors include Ying Zheng, known as the First Emperor; the Empress Wu Zetian; the eunuch Wei Zhongxian; Qin Hui, posthumously titled Zhongxian, later changed to Miuxing; Zeng Guofan, posthumously titled Wenzheng; Li Hongzhang, posthumously titled Wenzhong; Yuan Shikai, known as the Hongxian Emperor; and Duan Qirui, the Chief Executive of the Republic of China. Among his uncles are Wu Peifu, known as the F威上将军. He also has two foreign saintly relatives, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

Recently, he has also recognized a well-known godfather—American imperialism.

Chiang Kai-shek, a fascist variant, has been riding on the backs of the Chinese people for nineteen years. He has used the blood and flesh of the Chinese people to purchase large gardens in Brazil, opened numerous banks, and become the top dog among Chinese financial tycoons with $200 million in American deposits, becoming the biggest landlord and tyrant.

For his personal interests and the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, Chiang Kai-shek engaged in ten years of civil war, turning the land red and killing people like flies. He also went to Tokyo to meet with the Japanese special agent Mitsuru Toyama, declaring the necessity of Sino-Japanese cooperation, secretly acknowledging the Nishihara Loans, and signing the "Shanghai Truce Agreement," "Tanggu Agreement," and "He-Umezu Agreement," selling out the Northeast, Jehol, Eastern Hebei, and even the entire North China.

During the War of Resistance, Japan attempted to induce surrender five times, and Chiang Kai-shek wavered five times. He colluded with enemy puppets to oppose the Communist Party and the people, constantly cooperating with the enemy and puppet troops to attack the anti-Japanese Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, and attacking the people's liberated areas. As soon as the War of Resistance was won, he openly joined forces with the Japanese and puppets.

More than a year has passed since the victory of the War of Resistance, but Chiang Kai-shek has not only failed to provide the people with a peaceful and prosperous life, but has instead launched a heinous civil war. He not only refuses to build an independent and democratic New China, but also secretly sells China to American imperialism as a colony, implementing autocratic dictatorship.

Under his rule, more than 40 million people in nineteen provinces are starving, eating grass roots, tree bark, and Guanyin clay, even eating their own children, leading to strikes by hundreds of thousands of civil servants in thirteen provinces and popular uprisings forcing over two hundred thousand people to become bandits in eleven provinces.

Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding everything, shamelessly sells China's military power, political power, economic power, territorial waters, airspace, and inland river navigation rights, spending 100 million yuan every month to his godfather to fight the civil war!

On Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday, his sons and grandsons are giving him a birthday with longevity noodles and longevity peaches, but the people of the whole country are wishing him "death" (嘏) by opposing treason, opposing civil war, and opposing dictatorship, digging his grave and welcoming his full lifespan.

### 给蒋介石做“寿”

　　给蒋介石做“寿”
    陈孔
    蒋管区内的蒋子蒋孙们，今天（十月三十一日）正在那里写蒋介石的“六十大寿”而忙碌。据中央社的消息说：南京的商店住户，都要奉令悬旗志“庆”，太监们主持下的新生活运动总会，要“策动”市民午餐吃面食，面食店被迫半价出售寿桃寿面，还要放演“领袖万岁”的电影，在新疆方面更有什么“祝嘏献机”…………够了！真是懿欤盛哉！
    蒋介石该死之年，不省悟省悟自己对于国家民族，对于人民的罪过，却厚着脸皮要人民给他做“寿”，向人民索钱“献机”来屠杀人民，用他自己爱用的话来说，实在“无异禽兽”，“也就是不知礼义廉耻”。
    蒋介石的来路，是不明不白的，有人怀疑他是个杂种，我以为他那个臭皮襄是不是个杂种，是件小事，而把他作为一个政治的人来看，替他清查清查政治血统，倒还必要。
    他的政治血统确是一个不折不扣的杂种，一个买办的与封建的私生的法西斯混血儿。
    诚如范文澜同志所说：他的始祖姓嬴讳政号始皇帝；一说姓武讳的那位则天皇帝；姓魏讳忠贤的那位司礼监秉笔太监；姓秦讳桧字会之，谥忠献，改谥谬醒的那位太师公；都有些血统关系。高祖姓曾讳国藩，号涤生，赐谥文正；曾祖姓李讳鸿章，字少荃，赐谥文忠；显祖姓袁讳世凯，字慰亭，号洪宪皇帝。显考姓段讳祺瑞，字芝泉，号中华民国执政。伯叔辈有姓吴讳佩孚的，字子玉，号孚威上将军。还有两位外国圣亲，一位姓墨索里尼，讳贝尼多；一位姓希特勒，讳阿多夫。
    最近他还认了一个众所周知的干爸爸——美帝国主义。
    法西斯变种的蒋介石，骑在中国人民的头上，已经十九年了，用中国人民的血肉，购买了巴西的大花园，开设了不少银行，坐上了中国财阀在美国存款二十万万美金的第一把交椅，成了最大的地主恶霸。
    蒋介石为了他个人的利益，为了大地主大资产阶级的利益，曾经干过十年内战，赤地千里，杀人如麻，也曾经到过东京会见日本特务头子头山满，宣称中日联合的必要，秘密承认西原借款，签订“上海停战协定”、“塘沽协定”、“何梅协定”，出卖东北，热河，冀东乃至整个华北。
    在抗战中，日本诱降了五次，蒋介石动摇了五次，勾结敌伪反共反人民，不断的配合敌伪军进攻抗日的八路军和新四军，进攻人民的解放区，抗战刚刚胜利就公开和日伪合流。
    抗战胜利已经一年多了，蒋介石不仅没有使人民安居乐业，反而掀起了万恶的内战，不仅不从事建设独立民主的新中国，而且把中国偷偷卖给美帝国主义作殖民地，实施专制独裁。
    在他的统治下，十九省的四千多万灾民挨饿，吃草根，吃树皮，吃观音土，吃自己的儿女，以致十三省数十万公务员的罢工，十一省二十余万逼上梁山的民变。
    蒋介石却不顾一切，无耻的出卖了中国的军权、政权、经济权、领海权、领空权、内河航行权，每月耗费一万万万元的钱财给他的干爸爸来打内战！
    在蒋介石六十岁的今天，蒋子蒋孙们用寿面寿桃来给蒋介石做寿，全国的人民却用反对卖国，反对内战，反对独裁来为他祝“古”（嘏），给他掘好了坟墓，迎他满寿。
