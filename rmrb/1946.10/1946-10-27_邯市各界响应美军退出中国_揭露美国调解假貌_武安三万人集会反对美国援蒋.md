　　Handan Circles Respond to US Troop Withdrawal from China
    Exposing American Mediation as a Sham
    Wu'an 30,000-Strong Rally Opposes American Aid to Chiang Kai-shek
    [Report from this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 23rd, various circles in Handan held a symposium at the Dazhong Theater in response to the movement for the withdrawal of US troops from China. More than 200 people attended, including liberated peasants, workers, merchants, and students. Mr. Li Jirui, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, presided over the meeting, and the atmosphere was filled with indignation. Lü Huaide, a militia member from the South Gate said, "We drove away the Japanese, and now the Americans are here. What is it called to have our home occupied by foreigners!" A citizen from Beidajie said, "The US is not mediating disputes in China, but provoking them, adding fuel to the fire. They should have been told to get out of China long ago." Wang Shuhua from Beimenli shouted loudly, "I cannot be a slave of a foreign country for the second time. I have been a slave of a foreign country under the Japanese long enough. I have been a shop assistant all my life, begging for food. Now I don't beg anymore, I have been allocated houses and land, and I have only had a few good days. Old Chiang and the Americans are here again, and I will fight him no matter what." Shop assistant Wang Shigong recounted the atrocities of the US military, saying, "This spring, when he returned to his home in Tianjin, he personally saw an American soldier beat a rickshaw puller with a beer bottle until he could not move. Li Qingshan, a farmer from Dongxiaotun, said passionately, "When the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party came, the peasants were allocated three mu of land, but Chiang Kai-shek wanted to sell the whole of China to the United States. Old Chiang is the first big tyrant, big landlord, and big traitor in China." Mayor Wang summarized everyone's opinions, pointing out that all those who do not want to be slaves of a foreign country should unite. American aggression against China harms not only the poor, but also big merchants and capitalists. He called on everyone to step up their work, prepare well for war, and properly protect important materials. Finally, Mr. Li Jirui called on merchants to promote local goods and resist American goods. After the meeting, the Municipal National Salvation Association distributed the ten major crimes of the US military's invasion of China and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, and handed them to the attendees to take back as materials for widespread publicity.
    [Report from this newspaper, Wu'an] On the 22nd, more than 30,000 people from Wu'an gathered in the square outside Yangyi Town to hold a rally against US imperialism's aid to Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war and demanding the convening of a people's representative conference in the liberated areas. When the rally began, the first to speak was Guo Hengde, a first-class textile hero of the border region. He pointed out: We will no longer be deceived by Chiang Kai-shek. He is now launching a full-scale attack on us, so we must prepare to fight him. Immediately afterwards, the enemy-killing hero Yan Zhengcheng called on the militia: "Our militia must be urgently mobilized to drive out those imperialist enemies who are invading us and defend our homeland. Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of US imperialism, has launched a full-scale attack on us, so what peace are we still talking about with him." Finally, Mr. Shen Lianchang, a senator from the business community of the border region, said: "We businessmen can only do good business under the leadership of the democratic government in the liberated areas. If we were under the control of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government, we small businessmen would have starved to death long ago. In the Kuomintang area, many big factories and shops have been closed down by American goods. We oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous policies, and I, on behalf of the businessmen, demand that a people's representative conference be convened in the liberated areas as soon as possible." After the meeting, a large parade of more than 30,000 people began. (Zhu Bo)

　　邯市各界响应美军退出中国
    揭露美国调解假貌
    武安三万人集会反对美国援蒋
    【本报讯】邯市各界于二十三日下午二时在大众剧院召开座谈会，响应美军退出中国运动。到会有翻身农民、工人、商人、学生等二百余人。由商联会主席李吉瑞先生主持，会场充满激愤的情绪。南关基干自卫队员吕怀德说：“打走了日本，现在又来一个美国，我们的家，让外人霸占，这算什么话！”北大街的一个市民说：“美国在中国就不是调解纠纷，而是挑拨，火上加油，早该叫他滚出中国去。”北门里的王树华大声叫喊着“我不能二次当亡国奴，我给日本当亡国奴已当够了。我一辈子当小伙计，向人要饭吃，现在不要饭了，分到了房和地，才过了两天好日子，老蒋这老小子和美国又来了，我非和他斗不行。”店员王世功控诉美军暴行时说：“今年春天他回天津家里，亲眼见一个美兵用啤酒瓶把一个洋车夫打得不能动了。东小屯的农民李青善激昂的说：“八路军共产党来，农民分得了三亩地，蒋介石却要把全中国卖给美国，老蒋是中国第一个大恶霸大地主大卖国贼。”王市长综合大家意见，指出：一切不愿当亡国奴的都该团结起来，美国侵略中国，不只穷苦人民受害，大商人资本家也一样受害。他号召大家加紧工作，好好备战，把重要物资好好保藏起来。最后李吉瑞先生号召：商人应提倡土货，抵制美货。会后市救国会散发美军侵占中国及蒋介石卖国的十大罪行，交给到会的人带回作普遍宣传的材料。
    【本报武安讯】武安三万余群众于二十二日集结于阳邑镇郊外广场上，举行反对美帝国主义援蒋内战及要求召开解放区人民代表会的大会。大会开会时，第一个讲话的是边区一等纺织英雄郭恒的，他指出：咱们再也不受蒋介石的欺骗了，他现在已全面进攻咱，咱就准备好和他拚。紧接着杀敌英雄阎正成向民兵号召：“我们民兵都紧急动员起来，把那些侵犯我们的敌人帝国主义打出去，保卫咱的家乡。老蒋在美帝国主义帮助下，已全面向咱进攻，咱还和他讲什么和平。”最后由边区商界参议员申连昌先生讲：“我们商人在解放区民主政府领导下，才有好生意做，如果在蒋介石的卖国政府统制下，咱们这些小生意人，早饿死了。在国民党区有多少大工厂商店，都被美国货物闹的关了门。我们反对蒋介石的卖国政策，我代表商人要求赶快召开解放区人民代表大会。”会议结束后，就开始了三万余人的大游行。（朱波）
