Caring for the Self-Defense War of the Military and Civilians of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
Chairman Yang Personally Visits the Front Lines to Offer Condolences

　　[This newspaper’s dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 20th] Chairman Yang of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, concerned about the self-defense war of the military and civilians in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, personally visited the front lines to offer condolences. This reporter visited Chairman Yang in a certain village in the war zone. The Chairman said: This trip is on behalf of the Border Region Government and the people of the entire region, to extend our respects and condolences to the military and civilians of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. It is reported that when the Chiang army suddenly used massive forces to attack our region, the military and civilians of Hebei-Shandong-Henan rose up to counterattack in a short time, and all aspects were able to cope with ease, and the war support work was well guaranteed, resulting in continuous and great victories. All the people of the region and all comrades of the Border Government admire this very much. He continued: “The scale of this Longhai Campaign is unprecedented, and the magnitude of our victory and the amount of captures are also unprecedented. This is due to the wise command of our Generals Liu and Deng, the brave sacrifice of the soldiers on the Longhai front, and the enthusiastic participation of the masses in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. I represent all the people of the entire border region to pay tribute to the military and civilians fighting bravely on the entire front.” He said, “In the first half of this year, the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan were forced to rush to repair the Yellow River levee day and night during the busy summer farming season due to the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, paying a great deal of manpower and material resources. After months of hard work and losses without rest and compensation, it was followed by this large-scale and continuous patriotic self-defense war. The people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, united at the front and in the rear, bravely advanced to complete the historical task of the patriotic self-defense war. This spirit of arduous struggle and perseverance deserves our deepest condolences.” Chairman Yang pointed out, "Since the Chiang army's offensive this spring, our army has fought continuously and won continuously. The troops have become stronger and larger with each battle. Now guerrilla warfare has been widely launched in the north and south of the Longhai Railway, and the weaknesses of the Chiang army have been fully exposed.” Chairman Yang continued, "The people of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are enthusiastically participating in the war. Hundreds of thousands of farmers, braving the hail of bullets, serve the war in the mud and water, month after month, which shows our strong popular will. Especially the recent widespread upsurge in joining the army, with countless outstanding young people automatically pouring into the main forces, has further laid the foundation for our inevitable victory. Judging from the current situation, our border region will not see the reactionaries give up until we have eliminated a certain number of the Chiang army's living forces. He will also transfer his garrison troops to the battle. Therefore, the war is a long-term one. We must plan for the long term in everything. On the front, we must not be arrogant or slack, but continue to work hard to inflict greater blows on the invading army, and cherish the people's strength, using a lean and efficient stretcher team to complete the combat tasks. In the rear, we must organize production in a planned way, implement large-scale mutual assistance in the whole village as much as possible, and launch a surprise attack on wheat planting, so that our manpower, financial resources, civilian grain, and military grain can all be abundant and prosperous until the final victory of the war.” Finally, Chairman Yang emphasized, "Tell all the military and civilians in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region that we must resolutely fight on. All the military and civilians in southern Hebei, Taihang, and Taiyue have unanimously sworn to resolutely act as your backing until we completely defeat the invading army of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.”

　　关怀冀鲁豫军民自卫战争
    杨主席亲莅前线慰劳
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十日电】晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨主席，关怀冀鲁豫军民自卫战争，亲莅前线慰劳，记者于战地某村往访，主席谓：此行系代表边区政府及全区人民，向冀鲁豫军民致慰敬之意。据称：蒋军对我区突然使用庞大兵力进攻，我冀鲁豫军民以仓卒之时间起而反击，各方面仍能应付裕如，战勤工作保证得很好，以致连续得到巨大的胜利。全区人民及边府全体同志异常钦佩。继谓：“此次陇海战役规模之大是空前的，我们胜利之大，缴获之多也是空前的，这是我们刘邓两将军的英明指挥，陇海前线子弟兵的勇敢牺牲及冀鲁豫区群众的热烈参战所致。我代表全边区人民，向全线英勇奋战的军民致敬。”他说：“冀鲁豫人民在今年上半年因为黄河归故问题，被迫于炎夏农忙之际日夜赶修黄河大堤，支付了极大的人力物力，几个月的辛劳损失未获休息与补偿，接着就是这次大规模的连续的爱国自卫战争。冀鲁豫人民前方后方一致勇往直前，完成爱国自卫战争的历史任务，这种艰苦卓绝、坚韧奋斗的精神，更值得我们深致慰问。”杨主席指出：“自今春蒋军进攻以来，我军即连续战斗，连续胜利，部队愈战愈强，愈战愈大，现游击战争已在陇海路南北普遍展开，蒋军则弱点毕露。”杨主席继称：“我冀鲁豫区人民热烈参战，数十万农民冒着枪林弹雨，在泥里水里为战争服务，数月如一日，足见我们民气之旺，尤其最近普遍展开的参军热潮，无数优秀青壮年自动涌进主力军，更奠定我们必胜的基础。就目前形势而论，我们边区在未消灭蒋军一定数量的有生力量以前，反动派还不会死心的，他还要调他的守备部队，投入战斗，因此战争是长期的。我们一切必须从长期打算，在前方要勿骄勿懈，再接再厉，给进犯军以更大的打击，并爱惜民力，以精干的担架队完成战斗任务。在后方要有计划的组织生产，尽可能实行全村大互助，突击种麦，使我们民力、财力、民粮、军粮，都能宽绰的、富裕的一直坚持到战争的最后胜利”。最后，杨主席着重的说：“要告诉全冀鲁豫区军民同志们，坚决打下去，无论是冀南、太行、太岳全体军民，都一致宣誓要坚决作你们的后盾。直到完全打败卖国贼蒋介石的进犯军为止。”
