　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 15th] The Yuebei Mass Movement Conference concluded a few days ago after ten days of in-depth discussion. The summary pointed out the future direction: Old areas – Qin Yuan, Anze, and parts of Qin County, Tunliu, Changzi, Pingyao, and Lingshi – should conduct a widespread review after the autumn harvest to assess the degree to which "land to the tiller" has been achieved. Except for some backward areas and new areas within the old areas (such as the suburbs of Anze), which need to continue mobilizing the masses, they should generally shift to production. New areas where mobilization has been underway for a relatively long time (such as Changzi and Tunliu) should continue to deepen the mobilization, paying particular attention to absorbing those who are silent and unwilling to participate in the movement, and breaking through backward villages. Newly liberated county towns and counties along the railway lines, such as Qin County, should launch movements to eliminate traitors and settle accounts. And pay attention to timely shifting to rent and interest reduction when the movement reaches its climax. Counties occupied by enemy troops and counties frequently disturbed by the enemy (such as Pingyao and Jiexiu) should mainly carry out mass guerrilla warfare, combining it with mass movements, and paying particular attention to arming the masses to protect their homes and land. On the Tongpu front, the current general policy is to fully support and strive for victory in the overall resistance; and to seize the time and geographical gaps to mobilize the masses. In terms of leadership methods, emphasize following the mass line, pointing out that whether or not the mass line can be followed is the decisive key to work performance after the policies and guidelines are determined.

　　岳北结合翻身发动游击战争  边沿区群运将有深入开展
    【本报阳城十五日电】岳北群运会议经过十天深入讨论，已于日前结束。总结中指出今后的方向：老区——沁源、安泽及沁县、屯留、长子、平遥、灵石一部地区，秋后要普遍检查耕者有其田实现的程度。除部分落后地区及老区中的新区（如安泽城郊）需继续发动群众外，一般转入生产。新区发动时间较长的（如长子、屯留）要继续深入发动，特别注意吸收不啃气的人参加运动，突破落后村庄。新解放的县城及铁路沿线的县份，如沁县等地要开展反奸清算运动。并注意当运动开展到高潮时要及时转入减租减息。被敌军侵占的县城及经常受到敌人扰乱的县份（如平遥介休），主要是开展群众游击战争，结合群运，特别注意武装群众保家保地。在同蒲前线，目前总方针为全力支持及争取全面抵抗的胜利；并抓紧时间上及地域上的空隙，发动群众。在领导方法上强调走群众路线，指出在方针政策确定之后，能否走群众路线是工作成绩的决定关键。
