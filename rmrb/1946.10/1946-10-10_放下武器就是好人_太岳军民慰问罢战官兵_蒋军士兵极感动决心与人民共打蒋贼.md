    [Report from this newspaper in Yangcheng, 7th] On the morning of the 2nd, in a certain area of Taiyue, the military and civilians held a welcoming ceremony for more than 100 officers and soldiers of the 2nd Regiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Army of Hu Zongnan's forces, who had laid down their arms in the battle of Guanque Village, Linfen. People from all over carried fruits, pigs, sheep, and other items to express their regards. Everyone said, "Now they are no longer enemies. Laying down their arms makes them good people." At the meeting, Chairman Wang of the district, representatives of the Eighth Route Army, representatives of women, and representatives of children successively made welcoming speeches, welcoming them to lay down their arms. It is hoped that they will carry forward this spirit of patriotism and love for the people, and jointly oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war. The soldiers of Chiang's army were very moved. Soldier Song Ziru said in his reply speech on behalf of the soldiers: "We were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek in the past. He asked us to put on American clothes and take up American weapons to fight our own compatriots. Now we are people of the liberated area. If anyone dares to attack again, we are determined to fight side by side with the Eighth Route Army and defeat his attack, so that we can return home to be reunited with our parents and wives as soon as possible."
