Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: On the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the Eighth Route Army continues to launch counter-attacks in self-defense. After Chen Cheng announced that reinforcements were arriving one after another, and boasted that "restoring all railways would take at most two weeks," the Eighth Route Army continued to advance towards both the north and south ends. In the south, on the 17th, they captured Xinle, Shahe, Zhaixidian and other stations, as well as the cities of Xinle and Dingxian. In the north, they also captured several stations between Zhuozhou and Dingxing. Baoding remains isolated and surrounded. The railway line controlled by the Eighth Route Army has expanded from 250 li to 300 li. In the central section of the Ping-Sui Railway, the Eighth Route Army still controls nearly 200 li of railway between Chaigoubao and Julebao, and has twice defeated the Yan-Fu troops advancing eastward from Datong to Julebao. The tall tales of senior officials of the Beiping Pacification Office about opening the entire Pinghan line within two weeks have once again been shattered. The Eighth Route Army recovered Gushan Station, 20 li north of Datong, and also controlled 40 li of railway line between Datong and Fengzhen. On the JiluYu battlefield, the elite troops of the Fifth Army and the 11th Division of the Chiang army, which had invaded eastward from Heze, have suffered more than 5,000 casualties, greatly diminishing their ferocity. On the 13th, the local corps of the Eighth Route Army in southern Shandong attacked the Chiang army near Zaozhuang, annihilating more than 400 of them.

Another important development in the past week's battles is that in the "occupied areas" boasted by the Chiang army, the Eighth Route Army and local armed forces have recovered many towns and annihilated several thousand enemy troops. In the Jidong and southern Rehe areas, which the Chiang army declared to have been "completely recovered," the Eighth Route Army launched a broad offensive of 400 li this month, killing or wounding more than 3,000 Chiang soldiers in total. Three county towns, including Leting, Ninghe, and Jianchang (i.e., Lingnan), and dozens of market towns, including Macheng, 10 li south of Luanxian, have been recovered. The Chiang side's county chiefs of Jianchang and Lulong counties were captured. The Beining Railway, the lifeline connecting North China and Northeast China for the Chiang side, is also under attack by tens of thousands of militiamen. Even the Tianjin Dagongbao had to reveal: "The war in eastern Hebei has not ended, and the Nationalist army has gradually withdrawn from counties such as Yutian and Zunhua. Many important villages and towns were recovered as the Nationalist army arrived, and abandoned as the Nationalist army advanced." The people of eastern Hebei believe that this will be the graveyard of the Chiang army.

In the JinjiLuYu Border Region, several elite armed forces of the Eighth Route Army advanced to the rear of the Jiang army in southern Shanxi and Hebei, Shandong and Henan, and, in coordination with hundreds of thousands of militiamen, recovered hundreds of villages and towns, and the decrees of the democratic government were implemented smoothly. People returned home one after another and carried out production as usual. Except for the railway line and a few isolated cities such as Yicheng and Fushan in southern Shanxi, all villages and towns have been recovered. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to slaughter the people of JinjiLuYu was answered by 100,000 young peasants joining the army and going to the self-defense front.

    敌后游击战争猛烈开展
    收复广大地区歼敌数千
    【新华社延安二十日电】平汉北线八路军继续展开自卫反击，陈诚宣布援军纷纷赶到，并夸口“恢复各条铁路至多只须两周”以后。八路军续向南北两端推进。南面于十七日一举攻入新乐、沙河、寨西店等车站，新乐、定县等城。北面亦攻克涿县、定兴间车站数处，保定仍然孤立被围，八路军控制之铁路线已从二百五十里扩展至三百里。平绥路中段八路军仍控制柴沟堡至聚乐堡间铁路近二百里，并两次击溃自大同东犯聚乐堡的阎傅军。北平行营高级官员之两周内打通平汉全线的大话又告破产。八路军收复了大同北二十里的孤山车站，并掌握了大同丰镇间的四十里铁路线。在冀鲁豫战场，自荷泽东犯的蒋军精锐部队第五军及十一师，已遭到五千余人的伤亡，凶焰大杀。鲁南八路军地方兵团十三日攻击枣庄附近蒋军，消灭其四百余人。
    上周战事还有一个重要的发展，就是在蒋军夸称的“占领区”，八路军和地方武装恢复了许多城镇，消灭了侵犯者数千兵力。蒋军宣布“完全收复”的冀东与热南地区，本月中八路军发动了四百里的广泛攻势，总计毙伤蒋军三千以上。乐亭、宁河、建昌（即凌南）三座县城及滦县南十里之马城等集镇数十处均被收复。蒋方建昌卢龙等县县长就擒。联系蒋方华北与东北的交通命脉北宁路亦在数万民兵破袭中。即天津大公报亦不得不透露道：“冀东战事未已，国军已逐渐由玉田、遵化等县撤退。许多重要村镇都随国军到达被收复，又随国军前进而放弃。”冀东人民相信这里将是蒋军的坟墓。
    在晋冀鲁豫边区，八路军数支精悍武装挺进至晋南冀鲁豫蒋军后方，与数十万民兵配合，收复了几百个村镇，民主政权法令畅行无阻。人民纷纷回家，照常进行生产。晋南除铁道线与翼城浮山等几座孤城外，所有村镇均告收复。蒋介石企图屠杀晋冀鲁豫人民，所得到的回答是十万青年农民参军走上自卫前线。
