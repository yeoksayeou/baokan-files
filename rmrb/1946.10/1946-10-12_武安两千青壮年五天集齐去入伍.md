　　Wu'an: Two Thousand Young Men Gather Within Five Days to Enlist
    [Our newspaper, Wu'an, 6th] In the past five days, 1,966 outstanding young men from the entire county have voluntarily signed up for the army. In Chengguan and other twelve districts, under the leadership of militia captain Zhang Qingyun and instructor Wang Qichang, 54 young people demanded: "Follow them to defeat the traitorous bandits' offensive!" Amidst the cheers and applause of the masses, the fifty-odd new soldiers led the masses, with gongs and drums, in a parade and demonstration, which immediately motivated the entire area, and soon more than 180 people enlisted. In the Eighth District, 200 people enlisted on the 3rd alone. The newly emancipated masses are all joining the army with unparalleled enthusiasm to defend their happy times. Their thinking is clear – to repel the invading Chiang bandits. Therefore, their actions are very resolute. Nearly two thousand people shouted the same slogan, and without looking back, surged into the glorious ranks. (Rong Yinong)
