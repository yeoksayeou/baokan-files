　　Spokesperson of the Taihang Military Region
    Exposes US Attempt to Create a Smoke Screen of Mediation to Assist Chiang's Offensive
    [This newspaper's Changzhi 12th dispatch] Today, the spokesperson of the Taihang Military Region issued a statement regarding the Chiang army's violation of the agreement and attack on Jiaozuo, stating: Chiang army's attack on Jiaozuo is another exposure of Chiang Kai-shek's determination to completely break with us. Since the Xinxiang Executive Group reached an agreement in Jiaozuo in February of this year, the Kuomintang army in northern Henan has never ceased its deliberate incursions. This attack was personally planned by Chen Cheng and Gu Zhutong during their visit to Xinxiang on September 27th. In order to paralyze our military and civilians in northern Henan, the Chiang side sent a US representative, Lieutenant Colonel Mee, on October 9th, ostensibly to investigate the Kuomintang aircraft's strafing of Jiaozuo on October 2nd and to negotiate the export of Jiaozuo coal, remaining in Jiaozuo for two days before returning to Xinxiang on the 10th. On the 11th, the Chiang army began its attack on our Jiaozuo. This once again proves that the so-called US mediation is actually a smokescreen for the Chiang army's offensive. The spokesperson finally called upon: The military and civilians of the entire region should urgently mobilize, crush the Chiang army's offensive, and call upon local armed groups and militias to launch fierce guerrilla warfare, cooperate with the main force in combat, and step up efforts to eliminate traitors, prevent espionage, and consolidate the rear. In temporarily occupied areas, guerrilla warfare and encirclement should be carried out behind enemy lines, and the Chiang army should be resolutely annihilated on the offensive front.

　　太行军区发言人
    揭露美方借名调处制造烟幕助蒋进攻
    【本报长治十二日电】今日太行军区发言人对蒋军违约进攻焦作，发表谈话称：蒋军进攻焦作，是蒋介石决心全面决裂又一暴露。自今年二月新乡执行小组在焦作获得协议以来，豫北蒋军蓄意进犯从未间断。此次进犯乃陈诚顾祝同九月二十七日到新乡亲手布置的，蒋方为麻痹我豫北军民，曾于十月九日派美代表见泥中校以调查十月二日国民党飞机在焦作扫射情况，与交涉焦作煤炭出口等问题为名，在焦作逗留两日，十日始返新乡。十一日蒋军即开始对我焦作的进攻。这又一次证明所谓美方调解，实为蒋军进攻的烟幕弹。发言人最后号召：全区军民应紧急动员起来，粉碎蒋军的进攻，号召地方兵团与民兵展开猛烈的游击战争，配合主力作战，并加紧除奸防牒巩固后方。暂时被侵占地区，应进行敌后游击围困，坚决把蒋军消灭在进攻的阵地。
