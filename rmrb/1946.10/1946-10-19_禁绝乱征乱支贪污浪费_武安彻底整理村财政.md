　　Eliminate Random Levies and Expenditures, Corruption and Waste
    Wu'an Thoroughly Rectifies Village Finances
    [Report from this newspaper, Wu'an] Wu'an thoroughly rectified village finances, registered public property, and eliminated random levies and expenditures, as well as corruption and waste, to strengthen material resources and reduce the people's burden. In the past, village financial expenditures in the new district were often not in accordance with the system. Village cadres often grabbed whatever they could to cope with temporary needs, and individual village cadres took the opportunity to embezzle and waste. In Nanxinzhuang, with more than 90 households, over 3,100 jin of grain and more than 153,000 yuan were spent in four months. The village chief of Dongdahe distributed 4,000 jin of grain, part of which was used by the village cadres, and the rest was all embezzled by Secretary Wang Haizheng. This not only affected the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also corrupted a few village cadres, causing undue losses to the work. After discovering these phenomena, the county government immediately issued a notice to all districts and villages to strictly abide by the system of unified planning and unified expenditure, and to stop all random levies and expenditures. Erring cadres were given education and criticism to facilitate a rapid turnaround. At the same time, efforts were strengthened to clear up public property in order to increase government revenue. Currently, financial and grain cadres in various districts are working with village cadres to investigate and register.

　　禁绝乱征乱支贪污浪费
    武安彻底整理村财政
    【本报武安讯】武安彻底整理村财政，登记公产，禁绝乱征乱支及贪污浪费现象，以增强物质力量减轻人民负担。过去新区村财政开支多不按制度，村干部为了应付临时需要，往往乱抓一把，个别村干部即借此贪污浪费。九十多户的南辛庄，四个月内就开支了三千一百多斤粮食，及十五万三千多元。东大河村长派粮食四千斤，村干部用去一部分，其余全被书记王海正贪污。不仅影响了干民关系，而且腐蚀了少数村干部，使工作遭到不应有的损失。县政府发现这些现象后，立即通令各区村严格遵守统筹统支制度，停止一切乱征乱支现象。并对犯错误的干部分别予以教育、批评，以期迅速转变。同时并加强清理公产，以增加政府收入。现各区财粮干部正协同村干部调查登记中。
