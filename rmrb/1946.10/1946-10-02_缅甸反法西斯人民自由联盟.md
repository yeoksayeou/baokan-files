　　Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma

　　Last May, the British Times correspondent in Burma reported in the newspaper: "The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma has now become the only political force that can represent Burma in negotiations with Britain." Because "those old politicians are very backward, especially most of them have cooperated with Japan and their reputation is tarnished." The Freedom League is a national political organization striving for Burmese independence. The following ten political parties and groups participate in the Freedom League: (1) Communist Party of Burma; (2) Burmese National Army; (3) People's Revolutionary Party (formerly a student group); (4) Patriotic Party (led by former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw); (5) Burmese Fabian Society (its nature is the same as the British Fabian Society, with three seats in the Burmese Lower House before the war); (6) Dobama Asiayone (also known as the Freedom Party); (7) All Burma Students' Union; (8) Greater Burma Party; (9) Sangha Association (monks play a significant role in the Burmese liberation struggle); (10) Women's Freedom League.

　　Among the above ten units, the Communist Party of Burma and the Burmese National Army are dominant. According to a British reporter: The Communist Party of Burma is the most powerful and influential political party in the Freedom League. Aung San, the chairman of the League, is a sympathizer of the Communist Party, and Maung Gyi, the general secretary of the League, is one of the leaders of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has great prestige because it organized a huge underground anti-Japanese work during the Japanese occupation. Their work was so generous and meticulous that they completely controlled the Burmese puppet army and some of the puppet government personnel. When the British Indian Army counterattacked Japan from India last year, most of the puppet army revolted against Japan, enabling Burma to achieve rapid liberation. At that time, the British military authorities also publicly expressed their admiration for the organizational talent of Burma.

　　The Burmese National Army is composed of the uprising former Burmese National Army. The commander-in-chief is Aung San, the chairman of the Freedom League. This army still retains some armed forces (a British Conservative Party member said in June this year that the army has 9,000 people), which is quite feared by the ruling class.

　　The League's political program is to strive for complete independence externally, and to abolish rural usury internally, and the state will help farmers (including distributing land to poor farmers), reform agricultural technology, and popularize education.

　　Burma is located southwest of Yunnan Province, China, with an area of 600,000 square kilometers, a population of 15 million, and abundant products.

### 缅甸反法西斯人民自由联盟

　　缅甸反法西斯人民自由联盟
    去年五月英国泰晤士报驻缅甸记者曾经在该报的报导说：“缅甸反法西斯人民自由联盟，现已成为唯一能代表缅甸与英国谈判的一个政治力量。”因为“那些老的政客已十分落后，特别是其中大部曾与日合作而名誉扫地。”自由联盟是一个争取缅甸独立的全民性的政治组织，参加自由联盟的有以下十个政党和团体：（一）缅甸共产党；（二）缅甸国民军；（三）人民革命党（其前身是一个学生团体）；（四）爱国党（由缅前首相宇索领导）；（五）缅甸费边党（其性质与英费边同，战前在缅下院有三个议席）；（六）德钦党（即自由党）；（七）缅甸青年同盟；（八）大缅甸党；（九）僧侣协会（僧侣在缅甸解放斗争中起颇大作用）；（十）妇女自由同盟。
    在以上十个单位中，缅甸共产党和缅甸国民军是占优势的。据英国记者说：缅甸共产党是个自由联盟中最强大和最有影响的政党。联盟主席安山是共产党的同情者，联盟总书记芒之东是共产党领袖之一。共产党之所以有很大威信，因为它在日本侵占期间组织了巨大的地下抗日工作，他们的工作是那样大度和周密，以致于完全控制了缅甸伪军和一部分伪府人员。当去年英印军从印度向日反攻时，伪军大部起义抗日，使缅甸迅速获得解放。当时英军事当局对于缅甸的组织才能亦公开表示敬佩。
    缅甸国民军系由起义的前缅甸国民军组成，总司令即自由联盟主席安山，这支军队现仍保存部分武装（今年六月英保守党议员说该军有九千人），颇为统治分子所恐惧。
    联盟的政纲对外是争取完全的独立，对内是取消农村的高利贷，国家帮助农民（包括分地给贫农），改革农业技术普及教育等。
    缅甸在我国云南省的西南方，面积六十万方公里，人口一千五百万，物产极丰。
