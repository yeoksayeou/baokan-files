Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th. After the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Zhangjiakou on the 11th, the self-defense war of the liberated area's military and civilians has entered a stage of comprehensive resistance. From now on, it will be more effective in annihilating the enemy's living forces. The communication lines of the Jiang army in the Ping-Sui Railway area have become longer, and the troops are more dispersed. The Eighth Route Army, which retains complete living strength, had already annihilated 10,000 enemies in Huailai before withdrawing from Zhangjiakou. After withdrawing from Zhangjiakou, it can more flexibly and powerfully extend its fists to strike the enemy. In the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway, the Eighth Route Army's local armed forces recovered Gushan Town, 20 li north of Datong, and Pingwang and Huayukou, important industrial areas southwest of Datong, on the 29th and 30th of last month. Sixty li of the railway between Gushan and Fengzhen has been controlled by guerrillas, and Baitazhen, 20 li east of Fu Zuoyi's lair in Guisui, was once captured by guerrillas. On the 7th, they again defeated two cavalry regiments of Fu's subordinate, E You-san, who were heading from Xinghe to Taolin. Fu Zuoyi poured out his troops to attack the east, and his rear is extremely empty. Taking the communication line from Guisui to Datong as an example, it is more than 500 li long, and it is in danger of being attacked and annihilated everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 13th. The direct subordinate unit of the 121st Division of the Jiang Army's 94th Army and one of its regiments (number to be verified) were completely annihilated by the Eighth Route Army after advancing to the Tianjiazhuang area southeast of Huailai on the evening of the 10th. The results of the battle are being verified. This is the second annihilating blow suffered by Jiang Jieshi after investing the American-equipped 94th Army, originally stationed in eastern Hebei, into the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway; the first was the complete annihilation of the 127th Regiment of the 43rd Division of the same army near Mapaoquan, southeast of Huailai, on the 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 13th. The flames of guerrilla warfare have spread throughout the vast and empty rear of the Fu Zuoyi occupied area on the western Ping-Sui line. Following the attack on Guisui Airport on the evening of the 2nd, the Eighth Route Army's elite cavalry force encountered three regiments of Fu's subordinate, E You-san's unit, who were heading from Xinghe to Wulanhua (northeast of Wuchuan) in the Chuyangcheng and Shibanqiao area south of Taolin on the afternoon of the 7th. After several hours of fierce fighting, two of their regiments were defeated, more than 70 Fu soldiers were captured, more than 80 were killed, more than 50 guns and horses were seized, and more than 1,200 conscripted laborers forcibly seized by the Fu army were liberated. When the Suimeng guerrilla team and the militia liberated Yihezizi, north of Guisui City, on the 10th, all the more than 200 Fu soldiers stationed there were wiped out, 60 people including a deputy battalion commander and below were captured, and a lot of supplies were seized. Two railway bridges on the Ping-Sui Railway between Guisui and Baitazhen, and between Qixiaying and Tobuqi, were completely destroyed by guerrilla militias active on both sides of the railway last month, on the 30th. Fu Zuoyi's lair and its transportation lines are constantly under the threat of the local people's armed forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 13th. Fu Zuoyi's army has moved far away from its Guisui lair to attack Zhangjiakou with all its strength, resulting in scattered troops and an empty rear. Only the remnants of the New 2nd Brigade and the 26th Division are stationed between Jining and Guisui. Only one shift of guards protects the railway from Guisui to Zhuozishan, and only the remnants of the 17th and 11th Divisions, with more than 500 people, are left in Suihua. The Eighth Route Army's local corps and cavalry guerrillas have risen up to attack, active behind enemy lines, and have received great assistance from the local militia and the masses. The militia north of the Outer Great Wall and south of the Ping-Sui Railway, in coordination with the local corps, are eliminating and expelling the "returning home revenge squads" and destroying the Fu puppet district village regime. They are now actively advancing towards the Ping-Sui line and the sides of the Gui (Sui)-Liang (Cheng)-Feng (Zhen) highway. On the 5th of this month, the Fengzhen militia, in cooperation with the guerrillas, attacked a Fu army transport team from Jining to Fengzhen ten li west of Yongwangzhuang in Haobo, seizing 80 camels fully loaded with military supplies and capturing all 40 transporters alive. On the same day, another guerrilla team and militia intercepted 80 sheep being transported by the Fu army from Fengzhen to Datong in Ying×gou, south of Fengzhen. They also attacked a Fu army transport team 40 li north of Datong, seizing 14 mules.

　　长城内外展开全面抵抗
    我军机动挺进敌后
    大同北克孤山平旺控制铁路六十里兴和击溃傅军两个团直捣归绥机场
    怀来歼敌师直及一个团
    【新华社延安十三日电】十一日八路军撤出张垣后，解放区军民的自卫战已进入全面抵抗阶段，此后将更有效的歼灭敌人有生力量。平绥路一带蒋军交通线更加延长，兵力更加分散。而保有完整有生力量的八路军在未撤出张垣以前，即已在怀来歼敌万人，在撤出张垣以后，就可以更机动地和更有力地伸出拳头打敌人了。在平绥路西段，八路军地方武装于上月二十九、三十两日收复大同北二十里的孤山镇及大同西南之工业重地平旺、花峪口等地，孤山丰镇间六十里铁路已为游击队控制，傅作义老巢归绥东二十里之白塔镇并一度为游击队攻克。七日下午复击溃由兴和开往陶林之傅部鄂友三骑兵两个团。傅作义倾巢东犯，其后路已异常空虚，即以归绥到大同之交通线而言，长达五百余里，随处均有遭受袭击歼灭之危险。
    【新华社平绥东线十三日电】蒋军九四军一二一师直属队及其一个团（番号待查）于十日晚进至怀来东南田家庄地区后，已为八路军全部歼灭，战果正清查中。这是蒋介石以原驻冀东之美械九十四军投入平绥东线后第二次受到的歼灭性打击；其第一次为该军四十三师一二七团八日在怀来东南马跑泉附近全部被歼。
    【新华社兴县十三日电】游击战争烽火已燃遍平绥西线广大而空虚的傅作义侵占区后方。八路军骑兵劲旅继二日晚袭击归绥飞机场后，七日下午复兴由兴和开往乌兰花（武川东北）之傅部鄂友三部三个团于陶林以南楚羊城、石板桥一带遭遇，经数小时激战，将其两个团击溃，俘傅军七十余人，毙八十余人，缴获枪马五十余，并解放被傅军强抓壮丁一千二百余人。绥蒙游击队及民兵于十日解放归绥城北迤河子战斗时，驻守该地傅军二百余全部就歼，俘副营长以下六十人，缴获甚多。平绥路归绥至白塔及旗下营至陶卜齐间两座铁桥已于上月三十日为活动于该路两侧游击队民兵彻底破坏，傅作义老巢及其输送线时刻处在当地人民武装威胁中。
    【新华社兴县十三日电】傅作义军远离归绥老巢倾巢出犯张垣，已军力分散，后方空虚。集宁归绥间仅留新二旅及二十六师残部驻守，归绥到卓资山仅有一班人警备铁路，绥化则仅留十七师十一师残部五百余人。八路军地方兵团与骑兵游击队纷起出击，活跃敌后，极得当地民兵群众之协助。外长城以北平绥路以南之民兵，配合地方兵团，消灭与驱逐“返乡复仇队”，摧毁傅伪区村政权，现正积极向平绥线与从归（绥）凉（城）丰（镇）公路两侧推进。本月五日丰镇民兵配合游击队在壕博永旺庄西十里袭击由集宁至丰镇之傅军运输队，缴获满载军用品之骆驼八十头，运输员四十人全数生擒。是日另一部游击队与民兵在丰镇南之营×沟截获傅军由丰镇运往大同之羊子八十只。又在大同北四十里处袭击傅军运输队，缴骡子十四头。
