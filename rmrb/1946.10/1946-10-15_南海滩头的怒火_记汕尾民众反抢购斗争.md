　　Fury on the Beaches of the South China Sea
    ——A Record of the Shantou People’s Struggle Against Grain Seizures

　　Shantou City, one of Guangdong's important ports with a population of 200,000, has seen even worse extortion and oppression since the Japanese surrender last autumn brought back by the Kuomintang officials. They appointed puppet bandits, colluded with local tyrants, conscripted soldiers and pressed for grain to support the all-out civil war. People forced to leave their homes went to Southeast Asia, resulting in barren fields, with only 50-60% of the autumn harvest. Although Chiang's army urgently pressed for military grain day and night, after more than half a month, they had not reached half of the quota. Consequently, Zhong Fenwu, the puppet bandit leader incorporated by the Kuomintang, was ordered to lead a large army into the city to carry out seizures, causing the grain price to rise from 30,000 to over 50,000 yuan per dan (unit of dry measure). As a result, there was a market but no grain, leading to a serious grain shortage.

　　The famine created single-handedly by the Kuomintang authorities worsened daily, eventually leading to unrest among the people of the entire city. After two days of醞酿, elders from the east and west neighborhood associations of Shantou, dockworkers, housewives, educated youths, shop assistants, and citizens gathered in the central square of the city for a meeting. An old man with silver hair took the stage and said with tears in his eyes: "For decades, we have been law-abiding. Today, we are forced to act! In the past, the Japanese seized grain, but who knew that the Kuomintang would come to seize grain again after the victory of the war of resistance, forcing people to death!" He resolutely said, "Everyone must determine their purpose; to avoid starvation, we are not afraid of being beaten to death!" During the meeting, everyone decided to first submit conditions to the authorities through legal procedures, immediately stopping the seizure of military grain for shipment out of the territory to expand the civil war. They unanimously resolved: First, all the people of Shantou shall refuse to collect and transport military grain and provide any means of transportation. Second, if the authorities hire outside laborers and boats, the streets will respond to each other, with cannons as a signal in case of trouble. Third, everyone will bear the consequences of unfortunate events, and the steps must be absolutely consistent. Before the meeting adjourned, a dockworker shouted to everyone, "If the government does not accept our demands, we will decide to deal with it through illegal means. This world is really making it impossible for any of us to survive."

　　The whole city was boiling. The masses quickly organized themselves. Strong young men, holding heavy wooden sticks, took turns guarding the main intersections of each street, preventing even a single grain from being smuggled out. The old, weak, women, and children helped the monitors and scouts. Intellectuals actively carried out propaganda, with various slogans posted on the walls: "We cannot sit still and wait for death!" "We sincerely hope that the authorities will repent!" "Whoever transports a single grain, we will fight them to the death!" Experienced old people took on the task of negotiation.

　　The resistance movement persisted until the end of August, and its influence was spreading to the countryside outside the city. Representatives from various villages also came to participate. The Kuomintang, however, wanted to secretly transport the grain by boat via waterway at night, but before the grain could be loaded, it was snatched by the masses at the intersection of Ermalu, because the people were extremely vigilant. The next morning, people gathered in groups again to march and demonstrate near the grain seizure station, forcing the grain seizure station to close its doors tightly.

　　This large-scale resistance movement is still developing. The brave resistance of the Shantou people has shaken the entire Guangdong. (Ye Bochao, sent from Guangzhou)

　　南海滩头的怒火
    ——记汕尾民众反抢购斗争
    广东重要港口之一——拥有廿万人口的汕尾城，自去秋日本投降后，国民党官员带回来的是更甚的苛征与压榨，他任用伪匪、勾结土劣，为了支撑全面内战，抓丁催粮，被迫离乡背井的人民，多人走向南洋，因而田园荒芜，秋收只有五六成。蒋军虽星夜急逼军粮，但大半月过去了，不及定额之半，于是被国民党收编的伪匪头子钟纷武，奉命带领大军进城，实行抢购，因而粮价由每担三万涨到五万元以上，结果有市无粮，形成严重的粮荒。
    国民党当局一手造成的大饥馑，天天发展，终至全城人民骚动起来，经过二天的酝酿，汕尾东西两大街坊会社的耆绅、码头工人、家庭妇女、知识青年、店员、市民齐集城内中心区广场开会，一位须发银白的老先生登台演说，他老泪纵横的说：“几十年来，我们是守本分的，今天是迫不得已啊！过去日本人抢粮，谁知道抗战胜利了国民党又来抢粮，眼看要逼死人呀！”他坚决的说：“大家要把宗旨把定，为了不饿死，就不怕打死”！会议中大家决定，先循合法手续向当局提出条件来，马上停止抢购军粮出境扩大内战的行动。并一致决议：第一、所有汕尾人民一律拒绝集运军粮及供给任何运输工具。第二、如当局雇用外来夫役船只，各街道互相呼应，有事以鸣炮为号。第三、有不幸事件，大家承担，步调绝对取得一致。在散会前，一位码头工人向大家高呼：“如果政府不接受我们的要求，决定以非法手段对付，这世事实在弄得我们人民谁也活不下去了。”
    全城沸腾了，群众迅速的组织起来了，壮年人拿着粗重的木棒轮流的把守着各个街道要口，不让走漏一粒粮。老弱妇孺就帮助监视员和侦察，知识分子在积极的进行宣传，墙头贴着各色各样的标语：“我们不能坐以待毙！”“我们沉痛的希望当局悔悟！”“谁运走一粒粮，我们就跟他拚一条命！”老年人有经验的，就负起来往办交涉的事。
    反抗运动坚持到八月底，影响正波及城外的乡间，各乡亦派代表来参加了。国民党却想在夜晚偷偷摸摸的用船只由水路把粮装运出去，但是没等装好粮食，就在二马路口给群众抢散了，因为人民警戒极严。第二天大清早，人们就又成群结队到抢购站附近集合游行示威，抢购站只得把大门紧紧的关着。
    这一大规模的反抗运动，还在发展中，汕尾人民的奋勇抗争，已震动了全广东。（叶伯超寄自广州）
