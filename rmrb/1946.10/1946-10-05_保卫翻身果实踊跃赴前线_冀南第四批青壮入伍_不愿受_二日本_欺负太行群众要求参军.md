　　Defend the Fruits of Liberation and Enthusiastically Go to the Front Lines
    Fourth Batch of Young Men from Southern Hebei Enlist
    Taihang Masses Demand to Join the Army, Unwilling to be Bullied by the "Second Japan"
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 2nd] The fourth batch of young men from Southern Hebei have already set off for the front lines in recent days. Over 500 liberated peasants from Nangong have enthusiastically enlisted. In Xiaoma Village, Fourth District, six young people voluntarily signed up to join the army. One of them, a militia member named Ma Jintang, is the son of a martyr. He said, "My grandfather used to be a messenger and was shot by the enemy. My father was 'speared' to death by the enemy when he was in the Nangong County Brigade. They both died for the people! Today, I want to follow their example and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end to protect the fruits of liberation!" When the militia members from Xijiugong and Deyangong enlisted, they said, "We can only follow the Communist Party to ensure we always have food to eat." In Quzhou, over 600 young men enlisted in 20 days, including 279 young militia members. In Qiu County, a widespread atmosphere of enlistment prevails in various villages and market towns. Village cadres, militia, peasant representatives, women's associations, and other groups have launched challenge competitions, sparking a mass upsurge of enlistment. In a short period, 136 young men enlisted in the county. Among them were company commanders, deputy company commanders, instructors, and village armed committee directors, who took the lead as role models; many militia captains and instructors also led their militia to enlist collectively. Militia members accounted for 70% of the total number of enlistees. In Wu'yi, 150 of the 270 brave enlistees were militia members. As they set off for the battlefield, they firmly stated: "In order to defend our good times, we vow not to return home until we have defeated the reactionaries!" The masses in Pingxiang are all vying to enlist. Mass organizations in various villages are using rewards such as "staging big operas, making big flags, and buying bullets" for the winners, launching mutual challenge competitions. In five or six days, more than 350 people enlisted. In Jimalu Village, Fourth District, the old militia member Lao Ying was turned down by the sub-district during this enlistment because of his small physique. He cried sadly because of this. Later, he repeatedly and firmly requested to be allowed to enlist, and the sub-district finally agreed. Comrade Liu Pingshun, a militia member from Tingxikou Village, First District, is a decorated soldier who has been wounded four times. This time, upon hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was launching a civil war, he resolutely took his son to the battlefield. In Qinghe, 300 young men voluntarily enlisted in just six days. At the rally to send off the new soldiers, cadres and the masses guaranteed to do a good job in providing preferential treatment to military families; the new soldiers stated, "In order to protect the fruits of victory, we will resolutely join the Eighth Route Army and fight the reactionaries to the end." In other counties such as Weixian and Longping, the masses are also enthusiastically enlisting. In total, the fourth batch of enlistees numbers over 2,200 people.

    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 2nd] When the villagers of Meng Village, Neiqiu, discussed current affairs a few days ago, all the young people in the village vied to join the Eighth Route Army. Li Changzeng, the militia captain of the village, said: "We were ravaged by the Japanese devils for eight years, and now Chiang Kai-shek wants to sell the country to the United States, not allowing us common people to liberate ourselves and live a good life. Chiang Kai-shek wants to be the leader of traitors, but we don't want to be slaves of a conquered nation and be bullied by the 'Second Japan'. I must ask to go to the front lines." Influenced by him, many young people have asked to join the army. On the 25th, the First District of Lucheng held a district cadre meeting to convey the government's call to "expand the Eighth Route Army to defend the liberated areas and the fruits of liberation." At the meeting, six cadres immediately signed up to join the army: Niu Taixiang, director of the Armed Committee of Shuangqiao Village; Niu Shengjie, militia instructor; Liang Yidou, director of the Armed Committee of Southwest Mountain Village; Li Liulong, militia instructor of Beizhuang; Guo Guolin, political director of Nanchui Town; and Liang Xifu, director of the Armed Committee. Fifteen villages, including Chengnai and Dongguan, Nanchui and Jiangdi, launched mutual competitions, guaranteeing to mobilize 164 young people to enlist within three days.
