　　International Briefs

　　United Press: The Soviet Union issued an order on the 10th prohibiting American aircraft from flying over the Soviet-occupied areas of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania. All aircraft of American airlines suspended their flights on Eastern European routes on the same day and were stranded in Beijing and Brussels.

　　Associated Press, Moscow: The Izvestia newspaper commented on the 11th that the US aircraft carrier Midway’s visit to the Mediterranean following the Roosevelt was a sign that "The American flag has apparently been turned into a scarecrow. American reactionaries hope to strengthen American policy with this."

　　Washington: The waiters of eighteen famous hotels here went on strike on the 12th. Four thousand male and female waiters, elevator operators, telephone operators, porters, and cooks affiliated with the American Federation of Labor held a demonstration.

　　Another dispatch: Shipping has been stagnant for twelve days due to the strike of marine technicians. During this period, only a few liaison freighters sailed in ports across the United States. Negotiations between the union and shipowners and government authorities broke down on the 11th because the shipowners refused to grant the same wage increase rights to marine technicians on the Pacific coast as those on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. New York is suffering from both the marine technicians' strike and the truck drivers' strike, which has lasted for forty days, leading to a commercial depression. Trains can only transport one-fifth of the normal amount of goods to New York.

　　Washington: The United States' attempt to occupy bases in Iceland has been fiercely opposed by the Icelandic Communist Party and progressives, and it has admitted its failure to achieve its wishes.

　　Athens: Greek Communist leader Zachariadis commented on the Greek reactionary government's armed royalist bandits forming an "anti-communist army," saying: "If Britain ships the weapons that the Greek reactionary government asks them for, they will repeat the December experiment." Note: In December 1944, Britain participated in the suppression of the resistance forces and suffered a serious blow as a result.

　　Rome: Fifty thousand Italian strikers and unemployed workers (mostly road workers) held a fierce demonstration on the 9th to protest against hoarding, high cost of living, and the government's dismissal of road workers. Under pressure from the masses, the government had to allow them to continue to be employed. According to the Italian government gazette, two people died and 141 were injured in the demonstration.

　　New Delhi: The Executive Committee of the Muslim League decided on the 13th to join the Indian Interim Government and participate in the drafting of the Indian constitution. This decision has been submitted to British Viceroy Wavell. The number of participants in the government will be five, accepting the suggestions of the Congress Party.

　　Tehran: 100,000 people held a grand parade here to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Tudeh Party. The Tudeh Party was founded in October 1941 and is a left-wing party in Iran. Internally, it demands genuine democracy and land reform, and externally it insists on friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and democratic countries. It has played an important role in the struggle against the Iranian reactionaries.

　　London: Eisenhower said at a press conference here on the 11th that he does not believe that a third world war will break out, and he is optimistic about this issue.
