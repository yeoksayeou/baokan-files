　　[Report from this newspaper in Xingtai City] In order to clarify thinking, recognize the current situation, correct study attitudes, and support the patriotic self-defense war, Northern University has launched a surge of current affairs study. First was the roar meeting of the Medical College, where teachers and students rushed to volunteer to go to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers (as previously reported), and enthusiastically donated over 6,000 yuan to comfort them. Next, the Engineering College also launched current affairs studies. Current affairs discussions stabilized study emotions. To support the front lines, more than a dozen publicly funded students considered downgrading to half-publicly funded, two half-publicly funded students volunteered to become self-funded, and many other students went home to fetch cotton clothes, traveling hundreds of miles round trip. Many students also mended their existing worn-out cotton clothes for the winter, thus saving a lot of cotton clothing. The teachers of the Engineering College were even more resentful of Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas. Mr. Guan Dali and Mr. Xie [unclear character] who came to the school from Beiping, proposed to donate a month's worth of food allowance to subsidize the soldiers at the front, which was echoed by all the teachers in the college. Simultaneously with the Engineering College, the College of Arts and Education, as well as the College of Finance and Economics and the College of Administration, which successively returned to school from mass movement work, also launched current affairs discussions. A student from the College of Finance and Economics who came from the Kuomintang area hated Chiang Kai-shek's attack, but having nothing himself, he sincerely donated a pair of shoes issued to him by the public. The students of the College of Administration collectively decided to save over 100 catties of rice and over 6,000 yuan in food money to donate to the soldiers at the front. In order to further deepen and expand support for the patriotic self-defense war and celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of Xingtai City, the school affairs meeting specially resolved to organize a Propaganda Committee for Supporting the Patriotic Self-Defense War and Celebrating the Anniversary of the Liberation of Xingtai City. Teachers took time out from their busy course preparation to hold two afternoons of discussions on current affairs issues, and conducted ideological reviews on issues such as peace and the understanding of the United States. There was even more enthusiastic debate on the prospects of the patriotic self-defense war. Mr. Chen Weishi, Director of the College of Arts and Education, pointed out the cunning of American imperialism and that there would be no war today without American aid to Chiang. Mr. Zhang Baiyuan, Dean of Academic Affairs, provided a detailed analysis of why we will surely win the war. Many teachers became interested in current affairs as a result of this current affairs study. All cadres set aside time every day to study current affairs, and have already held several group discussions. Everyone is stepping up their work and study to support the patriotic self-defense war with practical actions! Currently, comfort donations alone have reached more than 39,000 yuan, more than 340 catties of rice, nine towels, and other items such as shoes and socks.

　　北大师生学习时事节衣缩食支援前线
    热烈争辩检查思想
    【本报邢台市讯】为了澄清思想，认清时局，端正学习态度支援爱国自卫战争，北方大学掀起了一个时事学习的热潮。首先是医学院的怒吼大会，师生俱争先恐后的提出上前线救护伤兵（前已有报导），并踊跃捐出慰劳洋六千余元。接着工学院也展开了时事学习，由于时事讨论而安定了学习情绪，为了支援前线，有十余个公费生纷纷考虑提出降入半公费，两个半公费生自愿降入自费，另外还有许多同学回家取棉衣来回走几百里路，还有不少同学将现有破棉衣补一补过冬，因此节省很多棉衣。工学院的教员更愤恨蒋介石进攻解放区，由北平来校的关大立与谢＠先生提出愿捐出一个月的菜金补助费给前方将士，得到全院教员的响应。与工学院同时，文教学院以及陆续从群运工作中返校的财经学院，行政学院也都纷纷的展开了时事讨论，财经学院一个从国民党区域来的同学痛恨蒋介石的进攻，但自己一无所有，于是就把公家发给他的一双鞋诚心诚意的捐出来。行政学院同学集议节省米一百余斤，菜金六千余元捐给前方将士。学校为了更进一步的深入扩大支援爱国自卫战争，并庆祝邢台市解放周年，校务会议特决议组织支援爱国自卫战争与庆祝邢台市解放周年宣传委员会，教员先生在准备课程的百忙中抽出了两个下午座谈时事问题，对和平与美国的认识等都作了思想检讨，对于爱国自卫战争的前途更有热烈的争辩。文教学院主任陈唯实先生指出美国帝国主义的狡猾与如果没有美国援蒋一定不会有今天的战争，教务长张柏园先生对战争前途，我们一定胜利，分析甚详。许多先生都因此次时事学习而对时事发生兴趣。所有干部每天都划出时间学习时事，并已分组讨论数次。大家正在加紧工作、加紧学习，以实际的行动来支援爱国自卫战争！目前仅慰劳捐款已达三万九千余元，捐米三百四十余斤，毛巾九条，其他尚有鞋袜等物。
