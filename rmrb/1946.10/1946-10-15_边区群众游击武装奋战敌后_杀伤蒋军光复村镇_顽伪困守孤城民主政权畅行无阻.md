(This newspaper's Handan dispatch of the 13th) Chiang's troops, lacking in strength, are throwing all their forces into the Jinan and Ji-Lu-Yu front lines in an attempt to avoid being annihilated by our army. At this moment, a portion of our army's elite armed forces is advancing into the empty enemy rear, fiercely launching a guerrilla war behind enemy lines. Local mass guerrilla armed forces are also rising up in succession, killing and wounding isolated and dispersed Chiang troops everywhere. They are eliminating the Chiang troops who loot and plunder from village to village like they are hunting "wolves," thus completely restoring freedom to vast villages and towns. Now, in the vast enemy-held areas north of the Longhai Line in Ji-Lu-Yu, south of Dingtao, east of Kaocheng, and west of Caoxian, there is no trace of the stubborn army. The democratic government performs its duties unhindered, and the masses in various villages have returned to their homes one after another. In the Wenxi and Xiaxian areas of Jinan, most of Chiang's troops have also been thrown into the Linfen-Hongdong front line. Except for the railway line and a few isolated cities, the vast invaded areas of Jinan have been completely recovered by us. All the blockhouses and fortifications have also been completely leveled. At present, our local people's armed forces have directly reached the outskirts of Wenxi and Xiaxian, and the few Chiang troops entrenched in the city are panicking day and night.

　　边区群众游击武装奋战敌后
    杀伤蒋军光复村镇
    顽伪困守孤城民主政权畅行无阻
    （本报邯郸十三日电）兵力不足的蒋军，正把全部兵力投入晋南和冀鲁豫前线，以图避免我军歼灭性的打击的时候，我军精干武装一部此时却挺进空虚的顽后，猛烈的开展了顽后游击战争。当地群众游击武装，亦接踵而起，到处杀伤孤立分散的蒋军。他们象打“狼”一样，把抢家劫舍的蒋军从一个一个村庄消灭的干干净净，广大的村镇就这样重新恢复了自由。现冀鲁豫陇海线以北，定陶以南，考城以东，曹县以西的广大顽后区，已无顽军踪影。民主政府畅行无阻的执行着他的职务，各村群众纷纷返回了家园。在晋南闻喜夏县地区，蒋军大部亦投入临（汾）洪（洞）前线，晋南广大被侵地区除铁道线与几座孤城外，已全部为我收复。各地碉堡工事，亦全部平毁，现我当地人民武装，已直抵闻（喜）夏（县）城郊，盘踞城内之少数蒋军，日夜恐慌不已。
