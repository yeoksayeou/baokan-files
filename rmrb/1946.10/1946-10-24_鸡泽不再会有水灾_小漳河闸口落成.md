　　Jize Will No Longer Have Floods
    ——Xiaozhang River Sluice Gate Completed
    Lin Li
    In late autumn, the Jize County Government invited two photographers from hundreds of miles away to capture the Xiaozhang River dam, diligently built by the people, and the heroes who built it, all on film. In the future, when the Jize County Chronicle is re-edited, they will occupy a glorious page and be immortalized.
    It is said that Jize County's topography resembles a chicken and is prone to flooding due to its many rivers, hence the name. Indeed, within the county's approximately thirty-mile area, there are four rivers: the Fuyang River, the Niuwei River, the Macao River, and the Sha River, all traversing through it. In the past, these rivers flooded every three to five years, and the 90,000 people of Jize experienced a major exodus every three to five years.
    I, the reporter, arrived in Jize on September 20th, which was the third day after the Kuomintang used airplanes to bomb the Heilongtan (Yongnian County border, 50 miles from Jize City) river mouth. The floodwaters surrounding Yongnian City surged northward, the Fuyang River overflowed its banks, and the Niuwei River's water level rose more than ten feet above the ground. Watching the golden millet and purple-red sorghum, the lifeline of the people's year-long labor, in danger of being swept away at any time, the broad masses, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, mobilized tensely. The men formed groups and guarded the riverbanks day and night. Women and children desperately harvested the half-ripe crops. Acting County Chief Comrade Zheng Mengshi rode a fast horse to the Heilongtan area to lead the work of blocking the breach. Political Commissar Comrade Han Guozhi was restless in the office, repeatedly saying to the reporter, "Tonight is the night that decides the lives of 90,000 people! It's risen another foot, dangerous! Dangerous!!" So, like a battlefield commander, he assigned this cadre to the Second District and that cadre to the Third District. He earnestly instructed everyone, "We must share the joys and sorrows with the people and carefully watch over the river water." He was not satisfied with just these tasks. On October 1st, he dragged his extremely tired body with the reporter to the riverbank 22 miles away. He said, "Working in Jize, one cannot become a good servant of the people without learning how to control water."
    The arrival of Political Commissar Han further excited the hearts of every river guard. The wheels of the carts pushing bricks and soil spun faster, and the sound of iron hammers pounding the dam became more urgent. A middle-aged man, looking at the "dum-dum" bullet casings from the Kuomintang's aircraft strafing the dike-repairing people, said indignantly, "Old Chiang, Old Chiang, how have the people let you down that you are resorting to such cruelty?"
    While the people along the river were fighting against the flood, the Xiaozhang River sluice gate, like a greedy tiger with a huge belly, opened its mouth to share the burden of the Fuyang River, demonstrating for the first time that it was a close friend of the people of Jize. The sluice gate was built on the north bank of the Fuyang River bend southeast of the old Chengying village. It controls the upper throat of the Xiaozhang River, arbitrarily swallowing and manipulating the Fuyang River's rolling torrent. The gate body is built with goose-wing-shaped stone walls, with a pair of stone lions guarding the top, flanked by floral-patterned stone masonry. The green willows on the riverbank make the sluice gate particularly magnificent and spectacular.
    If there are no more man-made disasters caused by the Kuomintang bombing dikes and flooding, the people of Jize, having control of this sluice gate, will have the freedom to arbitrarily manipulate the river water. No, if such a plan is realized next spring, widening the Xiaozhang River by one zhang and deepening it by five chi, and the lower part of the Jingjiazhuang (in Xinhe) water gate project is completed, then no matter how the Kuomintang bombs and floods, the people of Jize will proudly declare that they have forever overcome the scourge of water.
    The Xiaozhang River is an arm of the Fuyang River, bearing the power to share and regulate the water volume of the Fuyang River. It leans against the side of the great Fuyang River, passing through Quxian, Pingxiang, Renxian, Julu, Longping, Ningnan, and finally re-entering the Fuyang River at Jingjiazhuang in Xinhe. The people along the river can use it to irrigate their fields and harvest bountiful crops. In ancient times, it had shouldered this glorious task, but due to the oppressive policies of successive rulers, the Xiaozhang River was neglected, and the people of Jize had to let the Fuyang River manipulate their fate and endure endless disasters.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party and the democratic government, despite the cruel enemy-occupied war, never forgot the huge project of repairing the Xiaozhang River to benefit the people of Jize. The wicked Japanese invaders drove away the masses digging the river, chased away the artisans building the gate, and slaughtered the leaders along the river with their butcher knives. But the people did not succumb to this. Just as they firmly believed that the War of Resistance would surely be victorious, they firmly believed that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, the river repair project would surely succeed. So people secretly hid the already excavated stone ＠ and all the tools.
    The day of liberation finally arrived. As the people had predicted, the democratic government immediately established a River Affairs Committee and sent special personnel to handle the sluice gate construction project. But many unimaginable difficulties arose one after another. In the beginning, there were no engineers. What to do? The peasants finally selected their own engineer from among their own illiterate ranks. This was a 69-year-old bricklayer named Tang Laozhong. He was supported by everyone, measured the gate foundation, calculated the materials and labor, and then started construction. Ma＠han, who had been fighting stubborn stones for 34 years, measured 1,500 zhang of stone ＠ and then directed people to start carving. When it was砌 in the gate, there was no error at all. Especially these stones＠, even if you took out three million yuan, you couldn't buy them anywhere. The peasants tore down the temples that were foolish and deceitful, and moved the stone steles and memorial arches one by one from dozens of miles away. The first difficulty was solved. But when the river bottom was dug, a large amount of subsurface water surged out, and a lot of silt also came over, but the people who struggled unremittingly kept draining water and digging mud day and night, moving forward step by step. In just half a month, at a cost of only 115,000 yuan, the sluice gate, which was related to the lives of 90,000 people, was completed.
    When the photographer put away his camera, Tang Laozhong earnestly told the reporter: "I guarantee with my old life that it will never break." He added, "Two layers of stones are laid underneath, plus a layer of cypress pillars that block water from entering, think about it, how can it break?"
    The farmers passing by crowded around the group of heroes and praised them: "Thanks to you a group of gate-building heroes." "Thanks to our Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." Finally, everyone unanimously proposed to send a letter to Chairman Mao, "Please rest assured, Jize will no longer suffer from floods."

　　鸡泽不再会有水灾
    ——小漳河闸口落成
    林里
    秋末，鸡泽县府从百里以外请来两位摄影师，把人民辛勤建设的小漳河大水闸及建闸的英雄们一齐映进了“开麦拉”，在未来从新编鸡泽民志的时候，他们占据光荣的一页，而永垂不朽。
    据说鸡泽县地形似鸡而多河易淹故称。的确，在约三十里的县境内，竟有滏阳河、牛尾泥、马槽河、沙河四条河横贯其间，这些河过去三五年泛滥一次，鸡泽九万人民也三五年大流亡一次。
    记者九月二十日抵达鸡泽，那正是国民党用飞机炸开黑龙潭（永年县界、离鸡泽城五十里）河口的第三天，永年城周的洪水汹涌澎湃的向北流，滏阳河水平槽了、牛尾河水超出地面丈把高。眼看着金黄的谷稻、紫红的高粱，老百姓辛劳一年的命根随时都有被漂没的危险，广大的群众在共产党、民主政府领导下紧张的动员起来了，男子汉成群结队，日以继夜的把守着河岸，妇女和儿童拚命的抢收半熟的庄稼。代理县长郑孟时同志乘着快马飞往黑龙潭一带领导堵口工作，政委韩国治同志在办公室里坐卧不安，一次次地与记者说：“今晚是决定九万人民生活的一夜！又涨了一尺，危险！危险！！”于是他像战场的指挥官一样分配这个干部到二区去，那个干部到三区去，他谆谆嘱咐着大家说：“我们一定要和老百姓一起同甘苦共患难，好好看守着河水。”他并不满足于这些工作，到十月一日他又拖着极其劳累的身体同记者一起到二十二里地以外的水边去，他说：“在鸡泽工作不学会治水，就不能成为人民的好勤务员。”
    韩政委的到来，更加兴奋了每个守河人的心，推砖土的车轮旋转得更快了，打坝的铁锤声响得更急了，一位中年汉子瞧着蒋介石用飞机扫射修堤人们的“达姆”弹壳，愤愤的说：“老蒋，老蒋，老百姓怎么辜负了你，竟使起这样的狠心？”
    与沿河人民向水灾斗争的同时，小漳河闸口像贪婪巨腹的老虎，张开大嘴分担了滏阳河的重担，第一次显示出它是鸡泽人民的挚友。闸口就修在旧城营村东南滏阳河拐湾处的北岸上，它控制着小漳河上口的咽喉，随意吞吐与摆布着滏阳河滚滚的洪流。闸身修成雁翅形的石墙，一对石狮在上面踞守着，两旁是花绞石砌成的图案，河岸绿柳把水闸点缀得格外壮丽可观。
    假若往后没有国民党炸堤灌水人为的灾祸，鸡泽人民掌握住这个闸口，便有任意摆布河水的自由了。不，明年春天如果实现了这么一个计划，把小漳河加宽一丈，挖深五尺，其下口荆家庄（在新河）。水闸的工程告成，那么任凭国民党如何轰炸，灌水，鸡泽人民将骄傲地宣布，永远战胜了水祸。
    小漳河是滏阳河的一只臂膀，它负着分担与调剂决定滏阳河水量的威力，它傍倚着大滏河的身旁，经曲周、平乡、任县、钜鹿、隆平、宁南到新河的荆家庄而又重入滏阳河。沿河人民可以使用它来灌溉田地，收获丰美的庄稼，早在古时，它是担负过这个光荣的任务，但是由于历代统治者的苛政，小漳河失修，鸡泽人民便只好任滏阳河来播弄着自己的命运，承受着无穷无尽的灾害。
    抗日时期，共产党与民主政府，虽在残酷的敌后战争中，仍一刻不忘修复小漳河造福于鸡泽人民巨大的工程，万恶的日寇驱走挖河的群众，赶跑修闸的工匠，并以屠刀杀害沿河的领袖们，但人民并没有因此而屈服，他们如同坚信抗战一定胜利一样，坚信在共产党民主政府领导下，修河工程一定要成功。于是人们偷偷的把已经修开的石＠和一切用具掩藏起来。
    解放的日子终于来到了，民主政府像人民所预测的，马上建立了河务委员会，并派专人办理建闸工程，可是许多想像不到的困难，接连不断的提出来了。一开始就没有工程师，怎么办呢？农民们终于在自己这伙目不识丁的队伍里，选出了自己的工程师，这是一位六十九岁的瓦匠，叫汤老忠，他被大伙拥护出来，测量了闸基，计算了资材人工之后，便开始动工，同顽石斗争了三十四年的马＠汉，量了量一千五百丈的石＠后，便指挥着人们开始雕刻，当砌在闸上时，丝毫都没差了一点。尤其是这些石＠，即便拿出三百万块钱也无处购买。农民们便把愚蒙人心的庙宇一个个拆掉，把一块一块的石碑牌坊从几十里外搬来，头一个困难解决了。但当挖好河底，闸基地的阴水又大量汛出来了，还漫来了许多淤泥，但是奋斗不懈的人们，日夜不停地掏水挖泥，一步步地前进着。前后历时半月，仅以十一万五千元的代价，这个关系九万人民生命的水闸便告成了。
    当摄影师收起了他的机子，汤老忠恳切的告诉记者说：“以我的老命做保，永不会坏的。”他又补充着说：“底下铺两层石头、外加一层堵得水不能进的柏木柱，你想想看，怎么能坏呢？”
    过路的农民都挤在英雄群里称颂着：“多亏你们一批建闸英雄。”“多亏有咱毛主席共产党领导。”最后大伙一致提议要给毛主席带个信，“请他放心，鸡泽再不会遭水灾啦。”
