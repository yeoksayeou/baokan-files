Sharpshooter Wei Laiguo

Wei Laiguo is a platoon leader of the 4th Company of the × Regiment of the Jiaodong × Division. He has now been awarded a revolver by the division commander and a campaign has been launched throughout the division to promote Wei Laiguo's shooting skills. His most outstanding feat was during the attack by Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Army on Nanquan Railway Station, where he killed 110 enemies with 135 shots. The story goes like this:

Just as dawn was breaking, the various American-made cannons of Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Army began to roar again, and shells exploded around our army's positions. The comrades lying in the trenches were awakened by the artillery fire, and they habitually and quickly went to their positions, hiding in the fortifications, ready to give the enemy a good beating.

The platoon leaders had already started firing, but Comrade Wei Laiguo, whose ears had been deafened by the artillery fire, was still calmly squatting in the bunker. Platoon Deputy Zhao Xilian anxiously pushed him up. He grabbed a rifle that had just been seized in Jimo City and inspected the platoon's position before running towards the graves in the southeast.

In the distance, about seven or eight enemies were moving cautiously towards this side like mice. Wei Laiguo quickly lay down next to a grave mound near soldier Pan Yunting, placed the rifle on the already built fortification on the right side of the grave mound, quickly set the sight to 500 meters, closed his left eye, and began to shoot. Pan Yunting, who was watching from the side, saw clearly that he didn't hesitate to fire one shot for each enemy, and in the blink of an eye, he had felled more than a dozen enemies, causing the enemy to shout and scramble into the nearby sorghum fields.

"Look! Look at these fools, how can sorghum stalks stop bullets?" He greeted everyone with a smile, and turned back to open the bolt, loaded several rows of bullets into the chamber, quickly pushed in the bullet, and accurately shot at the chaotic enemy formation. Pan Yunting, like a child, grabbed a handful of small stones and counted the number of enemies killed by Wei Laiguo, adding a stone for each enemy killed. He counted more than forty in one breath. The remaining twenty or so enemies bent over and desperately ran backwards, leaving behind a pile of corpses lying in disarray.

The enemy, enraged, activated all their firepower and fiercely bombarded the protruding five or six grave mounds. Bullets whistled like the northwest wind over the heads of the five comrades who were defending the grave mound positions, and shells exploded incessantly in front of and behind them, with stones and sand flying everywhere.

After a burst of intense gunfire, the enemy began to advance again. Wei Laiguo ruthlessly shot at the enemy as before, and the enemies fell one by one in the face of the bullets. Pan Yunting also counted the dead enemies one by one with stones as before. When more than two hundred enemies gradually approached, Wei Laiguo ordered the entire platoon to fire fiercely. The enemy was finally blocked halfway again, lying down and daring not to advance. The enemy commander was so angry that his stomach was bulging, and with a wave of the small flag, the light and heavy American machine guns opened fire fiercely again. Bullets burst into plumes of black soil in front of the comrades' eyes. Wei Laiguo quickly moved to another grave mound. He seemed not to be fighting on the battlefield, not to be enduring the enemy's dense fire, but to be shooting at a target as usual, pushing out the bullet and dripping a few drops of oil on the rifle before continuing to shoot at the target. His gun was aimed at the commander who was shouting loudly. With a whoosh, the commander never got up again.

Suddenly, a bullet flew over Wei Laiguo's head, and then another bullet landed to Wei Laiguo's left. He quickly poked his head out and saw the muzzle of an enemy's gun pointed at him from behind a small hill 400 meters away. He understood that this was the enemy's marksman, specially sent to deal with him. "Okay, let's have a competition!" He quickly moved to a grave mound behind, aimed at the enemy, and with just one shot, the guy quickly retracted his head like a turtle. Wei Laiguo was about to push in the second bullet when a bullet whizzed past his right ear. When Wei Laiguo pulled the trigger for the second time, the enemy moved his position. Wei Laiguo's round eyes widened in a way that was frightening. He cleverly watched the enemy's movements, and as soon as the cunning enemy peeked out, Wei Laiguo's bullet flew over immediately, and the enemy immediately fell flat on his back, gone to the Western Paradise. This time the enemy left behind forty more corpses and fled back in a panic. But soon, after a round of intense artillery fire, more than a thousand enemies swarmed up again. Wei Laiguo laughed happily.

"What a good opportunity, so many live targets, comrades, shoot! Shoot!" His gun trigger moved faster than ever, and the enemies fell one by one in the face of continuous gunfire. Artilleryman Xiao Song also shot particularly accurately, and shells exploded like a string of pearls in the enemy's ranks. Deputy Company Commander Gao felled more than forty enemies in one breath. Pan Yunting was so excited that he forgot to count the stones.

"Platoon leader! A heavy machine gun." Wei Laiguo looked in the direction pointed and saw an enemy heavy machine gunner digging the tail of the gun into a cover in preparation for firing. Wei Laiguo raised his gun and with just one shot, the enemy who was gleefully starting the heavy machine gun kicked his legs and became rigid.

The enemy's several charges were unsuccessful, and the result was the same as when they came, retreating like a receding tide. And the four or five heroes behind those seven or eight grave mounds were still safe and sound.

At two o'clock in the middle of the night, a torrential rain suddenly began. The battle in the direction of Wei Tianbao in the southwest corner became tense, and Wei Laiguo quickly made a flanking shot. As soon as he extended the muzzle of his gun out of the gun hole, the enemy had already rushed to within thirty meters of the bunker. The firepower of both sides sounded like a torrent of angry waves that had burst its banks. Wei Laiguo did not panic at all, calmly looking for the enemy commander. Five or six commanders were shot down by his crisp bullets. At a distance of forty meters, a tall enemy commander appeared. Wei Laiguo pushed in the 135th bullet, which was also the last bullet. As soon as the gun fired, the commander's pistol fell to the ground, and the man also collapsed. The enemy lost their leader and rolled back in the mud in a state of confusion.

　　神枪手魏来国
    曲中奕
    魏来国是胶东×师×团四连排长，现已被师长嘉奖左轮枪一支，并号召全师开展魏来国射击运动，他最出色的一次是在蒋军五十四军进攻南泉车站时，以一百三十五枪击毙一百一十个敌人。事情是这样的：
    天刚发亮，蒋军五十四军的各种美式大炮又轰响起来，炮弹在我军阵地周围爆炸着。躺在战壕里的同志们被炮火惊醒，大家习惯地迅速投入阵地，隐蔽在工事里，准备狠狠的打敌人一顿。
    排长们都已经开火了，被炮弹震聋了耳朵的魏来国同志还镇静的蹲在地堡里，排副赵喜连急的把他推了起来，他顺手在身旁捞起一支才纵即墨城里缴来的大盖枪，向本排的阵地巡视了一下，便向着东南坟地里跑去。
    老远的地方约有七八个敌人像老鼠似的小心翼翼的向这边行动着。魏来国迅速倒在战士潘云亭附近的一个坟堆旁，把枪放在坟堆右面已经筑好的工事上，很快的便把标尺定到五百米远处，左眼一闭一闭的开始射击起来。潘云亭在旁边看的最清楚，一点不含糊的一枪一个，一转眼十几枪便撩倒了十几个敌人，打得敌人乱嚷嚷的向附近高粱地里窜去。
    “你看！你看这些傻瓜，高粱秸子还能挡住子弹吗？”他微笑的向大家打了个招呼，回手又把大拴拉开，押了几排枪弹到枪膛里，又迅速的推上子弹，慢慢的向混乱了的敌人队形准确的射去。潘云亭像个孩子一样，抓了一把小石子在魏来国身旁，给他数着打死敌人的数目，打死一个就加上一颗石子，一气数了四十多，剩下的二十来个敌人弓着腰拚命向后逃跑，丢下一堆横七竖八的尸体。
    敌人恼羞成怒，开动了所有的火器凶狠的向这突出的五六个坟堆轰击，子弹像西北风似的呼呼的在坚守坟堆阵地的五个同志头上啸叫，炮弹在他们身前身后不停的炸爆，石子沙土都随着飞舞起来。
    敌人在一阵激烈枪炮响过以后，又开始向前运动。魏来国像先前一样无情的向敌人射击，敌人便迎着子弹一个个倒下去。潘云亭也和先前一样用石子一个一个记着打死的敌人。当二百多敌人渐渐靠近了，魏来国便命令全排猛烈射击。敌人终于又被阻击在半路上，卧倒不敢前进了。敌人的指挥官气得肚子鼓＠＠的，把小旗一摆，轻重美式机枪又猛烈的开了火。子弹就在同志们的眼前爆起一股股的黑土来。魏来国迅速的又移到另一个坟堆，他仿佛不是在战场上打仗，不是在经受着敌人密集的火力，像平日打靶一样，把子弹推出来，给大盖枪滴上几点油，继续向着射击的目标。他的枪口瞄准了正在咋咋呼呼的那个指挥官。飕的一声，那指挥官就再也没爬起来。
    突然一颗子弹从魏来国的头顶飞过去，接着又一颗子弹落在魏来国的左方，他飞快的探了一下头，见四百米远处的小丘后面一个敌人的枪口正对着他，他明白这是敌人的射击手，专来对付他的。“好，咱们就比赛一下吧！”他很快的又移到后面的一个坟堆，枪口瞄准那个敌人，只是一枪，那个家伙好像乌龟一样早把头迅速的缩回去了。魏来国正要推上第二颗子弹，飕的一颗子弹，正好从他右耳边飞过去。当魏来国第二次扳动枪机时，敌人移动了位置，魏来国滴溜圆的眼睛睁得简直叫人害怕，他机灵的瞅着敌人的动作，当诡诈的敌人刚一探头，魏来国的子弹早飞过去了，马上，敌人就仰面朝天，回西天了。这次敌人又丢下四十个死尸，狼狈的逃回去了。可是不久，在一阵激烈炮火射击后，千多敌人又蜂涌的冲上来了。魏来国高兴的大笑起来。
    “那有这样好的机会，这样多的活靶，同志们，打呀！打呀！”他的枪扳机比任何时候都动的快，敌人迎着连续的枪声，一个个的栽倒。炮手小宋打的也特别准确，炮弹连珠似的在敌人群里爆炸。高副连长一气撩倒四十多个敌人。潘云亭激动的忘记了数石子了。
    “排长！一挺重机枪。”魏来国顺着指的方向瞅去，敌人一个重机枪射手把枪尾挖成掩体准备射击，魏来国端起枪只听一声枪响，正得意的开动着重机枪的敌人一蹬腿就僵直了。
    敌人几次的冲锋，都没有成功，结果还和来时一样，退潮般的滚回去。而那七八个坟堆后的四五个英雄们，仍安然无恙。
    夜半两点钟，骤然下起倾盆大雨来。西南角魏天宝方向的战斗紧张了，魏来国便神速的作侧面射击，刚把枪口伸出枪眼，敌人已经冲来距地堡只有三十几米了。双方的火力像决了口的怒涛似的响成一片，魏来国没有半点慌乱，沉着地寻找敌人的指挥官，五六个指挥官都给他清脆的子弹射倒了。在四十米远处，出现一个敌人高个指挥官。魏来国推上第一百三十五颗子弹，也是最后一粒子弹，枪声一响，那个指挥官的匣枪落在地上，人也栽倒了。敌人没了头目，都在泥泞中撞撞跌跌地滚了回去。（新华社山东通讯）
