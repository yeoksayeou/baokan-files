　　Chiang's Army Massively Drags Men into Service in Jinan and Shijiazhuang to Replenish Losses in the Civil War
    [Report from the Frontline Reporter Corps of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 2nd] In order to replenish the significant troop losses suffered in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield and to continue expanding the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has recently ordered Wang Yaowu, commander of the Second Pacification Zone in Jinan, to conscript 60,000 men in Shandong Province within three months. The Jiang army Li Lianxiang's unit in Qihe County has already captured a total of 1,000 men in its occupied areas and along the borders of our liberated areas and escorted them to Jinan. Xu Jingqiu, the former puppet county magistrate of Changqing County, is using the means of "strengthening public security" to curry favor with the enemy in the past, forcing the people to compile baojia and establish self-defense regiments, actively plotting to carry out the conscription of men, and the local masses are extremely panicked. All the men who were conscripted and escorted to Jinan were held in concentration camps, and they were not given enough to eat every day, and they were still wearing single clothes even though it was already deep autumn.
    [Report from Changzhi, 2nd] In Shijiazhuang, in order to expand the civil war, the Kuomintang is now holding so-called "recruitment" in addition to conscription. According to the official announcement of the stubborn officials in Huolu County, the number of "recruits" has reached 1,270. It is stipulated that the drawing will be held in three phases from September 20 to October 20. The Huolu stubborn county government has held a "recruitment" meeting on the 15th, and the villages and towns are drawing lots in turn. The meeting is presided over by the township chiefs, bao chiefs, police station chiefs, patrol officers, and local gentry. In fact, it is entirely controlled by local evil gentry and local tyrants, and the phenomenon of buying substitutes and forcing conscription is endless.

　　蒋军为补充内战兵员损失
    济南石家庄大量抓丁
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二日电】蒋介石为补充其在冀鲁豫战场所遭受之兵员重大损失，以便继续扩大内战，最近更限令济南二绥靖区司令官王耀武于三个月内在山东省抽抓壮丁六万人，齐河县蒋军李连祥部，已在其盘据地区及在我解放区边沿区抓捕壮丁共一千人押送济南。长清县原伪县长徐敬秋正利用过去逢迎敌人“强化治安”之手段，强制百姓编制保甲，成立自卫团，积极图谋进行抽抓壮丁，当地群众异常恐慌。凡遭抽抓押送至济南之壮丁，均被看管于集中营内，每日不得一饱，虽时已深秋，仍身穿单衣。
    【本报长治二日电】石家庄方面，国民党为扩大内战，除抓丁外，现又举办所谓“征兵”，仅获鹿一县据顽官方公布“征兵”数目即达一千二百七十名，规定自九月二十日至十月二十日分三期抽签，获鹿顽县府已于十五日召开“征兵”会议，向各保轮流抽签，主持者为乡镇长、保长警察派出所所长、巡官与当地士绅，实际上全为地方劣绅土豪所把持，买丁逼抓现象层出不穷。
