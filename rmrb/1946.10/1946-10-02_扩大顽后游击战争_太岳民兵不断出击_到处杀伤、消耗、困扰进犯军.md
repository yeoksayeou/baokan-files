　　Expanding Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines
    Taiyue Militia Constantly Attacks
    Everywhere inflicting casualties, depleting resources, and harassing the invading army
    [This newspaper Yangcheng 29th dispatch] The Taiyue Militia Guerrilla force is actively attacking the flanks and rear of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan invading army, constantly depleting and inflicting casualties on the invading army. On the 16th, the rotation combat team of the militia in the Second District of Yicheng defeated over 300 members of the "Love the Homeland Corps" led by Li Runmin, the "county magistrate" appointed by the Chiang army after they seized Yicheng. The Zhongtiao Mountain militia guerrilla units, operating on both sides of the Jiang (County) Yuan (Qu) highway, defeated two Chiang army contingents on the 19th, one invading Yuzi Village (15 li north of the city) from Yuanqu City and the other invading Wang Village (30 li northwest of the city) and Macun from Wangfang Town, killing and wounding 24 Chiang army soldiers, including a company commander; On the 20th, over 300 Chiang army soldiers advancing from Gaoluo to Shabaohe Village (15 li northeast) were again repelled by another guerrilla unit. During the battle, one of our guerrilla units even charged into the Chiang army's position, bayoneted its machine gunner to death, and used the newly captured machine gun to fire back at the invading army. On the 21st, they also defeated over 600 Chiang army soldiers advancing from Hucun to Yaojiazhuang Wanggen and other places northeast of Yuanqu City. The Chiang army stationed in Yuanqu, enraged and humiliated, concentrated over 1,000 soldiers on the 22nd to counter our militia guerrilla unit and invaded Wanggen, Shangxia Dengban, Baie, Liucun, Shengfotou, Tongshan Town, and other areas in the northeast again, which are now being harassed by our militia guerrilla unit. On the 10th, 13th, and 15th, the guerrilla corps on both sides of the Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) highway, the Chiang army transport line, completely defeated Xing Hengyi, a local bandit armed force incorporated by the Chiang army that had harassed our guerrilla base areas in Guoyuan and Niangniang Temple in Pinglu, and Jia Zhen's bandit unit that had disturbed the area east of Hedi in Wenxi, capturing 15 alive. On the 13th, the Fenxi Xiangling guerrilla force repelled over 1,000 Chiang army soldiers invading Dongguo and Xiafu west of Zhaoqu on the Tongpu Railway, killing and wounding nine Chiang army soldiers and consuming a lot of ammunition, threatening the flanks and back of the invading army stationed in Xinjiang and Wenxi. The militia guerrilla unit in the Jiwang Mountain area fought more than ten battles in one month, destroyed the Five East and Pudong village public offices and their more than 30 armed personnel, captured 14 alive, and seized four rifles and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Another unit, active on the Wan (Quan) Ji (Wang Mountain) highway, destroyed more than 20 li of power lines and once recovered Liwang Village, 30 li north of Wanquan.
