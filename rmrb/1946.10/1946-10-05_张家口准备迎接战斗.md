　　Zhangjiakou Prepares to Welcome Battle
　　Luofu
　　Compared to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou is a smaller city. But for more than a year, it is not Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, but Zhangjiakou that has been praised by Chinese and foreign democrats. The ancient Great Wall separates Beijing from Zhangjiakou, and many foreign journalists like to use it as a contrast between light and darkness. Now this "people's city" is threatened by the flames of the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Now, in the streets and alleys here, you can see the garrison troops and the people holding picks, building fortifications shoulder to shoulder. Everywhere are piles of sandbags and newly dug trenches. The soldiers themselves have designed many plans, meticulously imagining how the enemy might come from a certain place, and how we should build our own defenses to take advantage of firepower and kill the enemy. And where it may be necessary to fight the enemy hand-to-hand. Tense work does not diminish the soldiers' relaxed mood, and they are happy with the success of their construction. One soldier said to the instructor: "Instructor, if the enemy can get on this hill, I am willing to lose you two packs of 'United' cigarettes!"

　　Seventy-year-old Wang also followed the troops without interruption. Everyone persuaded him: "Old man, you should rest!" But he excitedly said: "Not tired, I can only rest when you eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bad boy's army." A villager said to the soldiers: "We are together in peace, and we are together in war; the people and you have formed an inextricable bond!"

　　In the past few days, citizens, especially workers, have been actively joining the armed forces; not one or two, but three, five, eight or nine walking to the front line together. In a few days, several hundred young citizens in each district signed up to join the army. Zhang Chengquan, director of the Shuijing Labor Union in the Sixth District, mobilized nine workers to join the army by himself. He is already in his fifties and joined the army together. He said: "I can't shoot a gun, but I can still do something. As long as I resolutely fight against Chiang Kai-shek, this reactionary thing, I am willing to die, anyway, I can't let him take away the good days!" Wang Sanyuan, a worker representative from Zhang City, led nine Hui people to take the lead in establishing Hui armed forces. He said excitedly: "I pulled a rickshaw for twelve years. When the Eighth Route Army came, I stopped pulling the rickshaw, changed my career, and my life got better. Now I can't let the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries come, I can't pull the rickshaw and suffer alive!"

　　When the Kuomintang's American-made planes harass during the day, or during the night curfew, you can see people with red cloths wrapped around their arms, with the words "Patrol Team" written on them, everywhere from noisy streets to quiet alleys. Relying on them, the order of the city in this unprecedented tense period seems even better, and there has not been a single theft for a long time. When I met Xu Zhenzhi, the instructor of a patrol team, he had not had a good rest for five nights. He said: "I have never worked so hard." I also visited the patrol teams of three streets. The squad leaders and instructors are all at work. They said: "Let's do it, I will follow the Communist Party to the end! I will get my money's worth if I kill a reactionary thing, and I will earn one if I kill two!" Hu Wanshe, the chief of Baijiagou Street, a worker representative of Zhang City (now the captain of the patrol team). He carries his rifle all day long. When I went to find him, he was sharpening his sword at the blacksmith shop; many of them have learned basic military instincts. A patrol team in an industrial area shot a target a few days ago, and 80% of them hit the target. Among more than 100 people, three hit 25 rings, and the average hit 17 or 18 rings; they threw grenades as far as 40 meters and could hit the target.

　　In factories, weeks or vacations have been automatically cancelled by workers, and the working hours are increased by one hour every day. The working efficiency has increased to 50% of the normal level, and some have even exceeded one to two times.

　　For a long time, prices have been stable. After the uncovering of the sensational military conspiracy case of the traitor Liu Jianxun, the citizens regained their usual composure; behind this composure, people are preparing to meet a serious test. They have the confidence to withstand this test. (Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st)

　　张家口准备迎接战斗
    罗夫
    比起京沪平津来，张家口是一个较小的城市。但一年余来，受到中外民主人士同击赞誉的，不是高沪平津，而是张家口。古老的长城把北平与张家口隔离开来，不少外国记者很喜欢把她用来作光明与黑暗的对照。——现在这座“人民的城”已为蒋介石所发动内战的火焰所威胁着了。
    现在，这里的大街小巷，到处可以看到卫戍部队和拿着铁镐的人民，肩并肩的修筑着工事。到处是堆积起来的沙包和新掘的壕堑，战士们自己设计了不少计划，他们周密的假想着某处敌人可能如何来，我们应该怎样修造自己的防御工事，以利发挥火力，杀伤敌人。而在那里可能或必须和敌人肉搏。紧张的作业，并不减煞战士们轻松的兴致，他们高兴自己修造的成功。一个战士对指导员说：“指导员，如果敌人要能上了这个山头，我愿输给你两包‘联合’烟！”
    七十多岁的王老汉也不间歇的跟着部队一起干，大家劝他：“老人家，应该休息了！”他却激动的说：“不累，等到你们消灭了蒋介石这坏小子的军队，我才能够休息。”一个老乡向战士说：“和平我们在一起，打仗我们也在一起；人们和你们已结下不解的姻缘啦！”
    这几天，市民们，特别是工人，纷纷自动参加武装；不是一个两个，而是三个五个、八九个一起走上前线。不几天，各区就有几百个青年市民报名入伍。六区水井工会主任张成全，一个人动员了九个工人入伍，他已经五十多岁了，一同参加了部队。他说：“我不能打枪，还是能作些事的。只要坚决打蒋介石这个反动东西，就是死了我也愿意，反正好日子不能给他抢了去！”张市工人参议员王三元，带领了九个回民首先发起建立回民武装。他激动的说：“我拉洋车拉了十二年，八路军一来，我不拉洋车，改了业，生活好起来了。现在我不能让蒋介石反动派来，我不能再拉洋车受活罪！”
    当国民党美造飞机白天骚扰，或者是夜间戒严的时候，你可以看到从喧嚣的街市到僻静的小巷，到处是臂上缠着红布，上面写着“纠察队”的人。依靠他们，全市秩序在这个空前紧张的时期，显得更加良好，很长时间内没发见一次偷盗事件。我会见一位纠察队的指导员徐振芝时，他已经是五夜没有好好休息了。他说：“我从来没有像这样紧张的工作过。”我又在三个街的纠察小队里做了访问，小队长、指导员全在工作，他们说：“干吧，我要跟共产党跟到底！打死一个反动东西我够本，打死他两个我赚一个！”张市工人参议员白家沟街长胡万社，（现在是纠察中队长）。终日背着他的步枪，我去找他的时候，他正到铁匠铺磨战刀；他们很多人已学会了初步的军事本能。一个工业区纠察队，前几天打了一次靶，中靶的达百分之八十，百余人中，射中二十五环的有三人，平均射中十七八环；掷手榴弹远到四十米，并且能命中目标。
    工厂中，星期或休假已经被工人们自动取消，并且每日增加工作一小时，工作效率有的提高到平时的百分之五十，有的甚至超过一倍至两倍。
    许久以来，物价一直处于平稳状态。在振奋人心的国贼刘逆建勋军事阴谋案破获过后，市民又恢复了平常的镇静；在这种镇静背后，人们在准备着迎接一次严重的考验。他们有信心经受这种考验。（新华社张家口一日电）
