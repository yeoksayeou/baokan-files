　　Licheng's emancipated peasants care for military families
    The masses in the First District help the troops with the autumn harvest
    [Report from our newspaper in Licheng] The masses in the Nan Village base point in the First District of this county are helping the army with the autumn harvest to support the front lines. Under the leadership of model cadre Wang Haha and labor hero Yuan Laohu, 87 men and women from Nan Village harvested 52 mu of grain for the 50th Regiment at the end of last month. During the harvest, the masses competed to be first and were very happy. Zhao Hengxian said, "In the spring, we help the troops and military families with early planting, early weeding, and early hoeing; in the autumn, we help the troops and military families with early harvesting and early plowing. This is an honor for the common people." Influenced by Nan Village, the masses in Qiaojiazhuang, Lizhuang, Sili and other villages also actively helped the army with the autumn harvest. As of the 4th of this month, the five villages have harvested a total of 220 mu of grain for the army. The harvesting of all the army's autumn land in the entire base point has been completed.

　　黎城翻身农民关心军属
    一区群众替部队收秋
    【本报黎城讯】本县一区南村基点群众帮助军队收秋，以支援前线。南村在模范干部王哈哈和劳动英雄原老虎领导下，男女八十七人于上月底给五十团割谷五十二亩。在收割中群众争先恐后，非常高兴。赵恒贤说：“春天给部队和军属早种早拔早锄，秋天给部队军属早收早耕，这是老百姓的光荣。”在南村影响下，乔家庄、李庄、赛里等村群众也积极帮助军队收秋割谷。截至本月四号，五个村给军队先后割谷二百二十亩，全基点所有部队秋地的收割，业已完成。
