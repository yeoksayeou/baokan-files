　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Cooperative Batavia dispatch: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir told reporters on the 15th: "Indonesia agrees to a ceasefire. Although Dutch troops are actually increasing steadily, Dutch commissioners stipulated that the total number of Dutch troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies should not exceed the current strength of the British and Dutch forces. The current total number of British and Dutch forces is believed to be about 70,000, while the Indonesian army is between 100,000 and 200,000." Sjahrir also said: "The Dutch side has not yet made any statement on Indonesia's counter-proposal in July, and the proposal is still the basis for negotiations between the two sides. It is hoped that the ceasefire will enable both sides to focus on these issues. The Dutch commissioners negotiate with the Republic and accept the ceasefire constraints, indicating that the Netherlands has at least recognized the existence of the Republic. The question for the Netherlands now is which areas ceded to Indonesia are included in this 'existence'." The unresolved issue between Indonesia and the Netherlands regarding the future political status of Indonesia is whether Indonesia will remain within the planned Dutch federal structure. The Netherlands insists that Indonesia should be part of the federation, while Indonesian leaders demand direct freedom, maintaining only the connections that arise from traditional economic and cultural relations with the Netherlands. Dutch Commissioner Schermerhorn also declared on the 15th that due to the signing of the ceasefire agreement, a basic political agreement with Indonesia could be reached before November 30 (when British troops will have completed their withdrawal). However, some specific matters may or may not be resolved. The gradual demobilization of both sides stipulated in the ceasefire agreement will obviously depend on the progress of political negotiations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Batavia dispatch: The conflict between overseas Chinese and Indonesians in the Bagan area of Sumatra has been peacefully resolved. Representatives of the local overseas Chinese organization, the Chinese Association, signed an agreement with the local authorities of the Republic of Indonesia on October 11, and an Indonesian Overseas Chinese Peacekeeping Committee has been established to handle matters related to conflicts between the two sides.

　　印尼总理沙利尔称
    印尼同意停战
    荷承认印尼共和国
    印尼华侨冲突和平解决
    【新华社延安十七日电】合作社巴达维亚讯：印尼总理沙利尔十五日对记者称：“印尼同意停战。因为虽然荷兰军队实际上源源增加，但荷方专员曾规定驻荷属东印荷军总数当不超过目前英荷两军实力，目前英荷两军总数相信约七万人，印尼军队在十万至廿万之间。”沙氏又称：荷方对于印尼七月所提对案尚未作何表示，而该案仍然是双方谈判的基础，希望停战使双方能着重处理这些问题。荷方专员与共和国谈判，并接受停战约束，表示荷兰至少已承认共和国的存在。荷方让与印尼的地区，究竟那些是包括在这“存在”之内，现在是荷方的问题。按印荷双方对印尼未来政治地位的悬而未决的问题，是印尼是否留在计划中的荷兰联邦机构之内。荷兰主张印尼应联邦的一部，印尼领袖则要求直接自由，仅维持与荷兰传统的经济文化关系中所发生的联系。荷兰专员谢梅荷恩于亦十五日宣称：由于签订停战协定，在十一月三十日之前（按英军将于是日之前撤退完毕）可与印尼获致基本的政治协定。但好些具体事项可能解决，也可能解决不了。停战协定上所规定的双方逐渐复员，显然要视政治谈判之进展如何而决定。
    【新华社延安十七日电】巴达维亚讯：苏门答腊巴眼地区华侨与印尼人冲突事件已和平解决。当地华侨团体中国协会代表已与印尼共和国地方当局于十月十一日签订协定，并已成立一印尼华侨维持和平委员会，处理有关双方冲突事宜。
