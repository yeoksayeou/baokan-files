　　Peasants Taste Happiness for the First Time
    Xinhua News Agency Jinnan Branch
    The land reform movement in the Jinnan New District has swept across more than twenty counties. The hardworking peasants are tasting what happiness is for the first time. There is no more sorrow on their faces, and they finally know the true joy of life.

    Striving for Production to Plant the Roots of Wealth
    After the struggle against traitors and corruption in the North Street of Linzhang City, the masses were distributed the fruits of victory. Under the call of "Planting the Roots of Wealth," they are actively engaged in production. Women who never spun before have bought sixty spinning wheels, and you can hear the whirring sound in any house. After the struggle against traitors and local bullies in Guilonggang, Handan, 102 poor peasants received an average of three mu of land each. Their enthusiasm for production has increased. During the autumn harvest, they organized mutual aid teams and harvested six hundred mu of sorghum in four days. Old man Zhang Shili picks up manure every day to increase production. He carries a manure basket wherever he goes, and his songs praising Chairman Mao and the liberation are sung wherever he goes. After the peasants of Xinhuaguan, Guangping, received the fruits of victory, every family built new houses. In previous autumns, ten or twenty mu of crops were often stolen in the village, but this year no one stole anything. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao has truly governed well."

    Changing Barrenness into Prosperity for Both People and Wealth
    Near the brick house of landlord Zhang in Houjie, Pingzhuang, Guangping, it used to be a gathering place for merchants, peddlers, entertainment troupes, and street performers. The landlords sought pleasure all day long, while Nanjie was a slum, with low, broken earth houses that were desolate and never saw smiling faces. Now people are smiling and driving livestock in and out constantly, chickens and pigs are everywhere, and songs are often heard. Merchants and peddlers have also rushed to Nanjie, and Nanjie has become the prosperous center of the village. After the masses in Lou Shang Village, Yongnian, were liberated, thirteen poor households and twenty impoverished households rose to become middle peasants. A hired worker who had lived for forty years could not afford to marry a wife, and was lonely for most of his life. Now that he has been liberated, he has land to cultivate and has also married a wife. His face shows irrepressible joy all day long.

    Every Family Harmonious, Everyone Happy
    In Nanzhang Village, Guangping, there used to be fights every two or three days, either you beat your child, or I beat my wife, or there were quarrels between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. There were shouts, curses, or cries everywhere, mostly because of "poverty." Now it has changed. The wife of Councilor Li Hesheng, who had not lived a good life for half her life and had long-term disagreements with her mother-in-law, is now actively weaving cloth. Zhao Hai's mother used to be angry with her daughter-in-law all day long, but now she is better. The daughter-in-law of military family representative Wang Liming, because of family poverty, did not live well and ran away once, but now she is living in peace, spinning and weaving cloth every day. Old man Lu Guangdong was given two mu of land and excitedly sang Hebei Bangzi opera at mass gatherings. An old woman said, "With Chairman Mao, I don't have to worry about starving to death. I have to live a few more years."

    Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival and Breaking Superstition
    During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the peasants regarded this day as the anniversary of their liberation. They bought mooncakes, made dumplings, and cooked meat dishes, which were very rich. They also held a conference, stilt-walking, Yangko dancing, and Huache performances, which were very lively. Dashan Village in Linzhang is the village with the most Catholics. After the liberation, each peasant had an average of 3.1 mu of land, and 87 percent of the peasants poured into the peasant association. They felt that God was a bit vague, and said, "Chairman Mao is the real savior." During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the peasants in the whole village held a celebration meeting, invited the stilt walkers from Wang Erzhuang and a storyteller, and everyone was very happy. Poor peasant Wu Xiangqing spoke at the table, comparing his past life with today's life, and then he sang: "The fifteenth of August is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the poor people raise their heads. Today we are having a happy meeting, and we have achieved victory in liberation, good fortune, and longevity." After Wu Jinke, the deputy director of the peasant association, was liberated, he moved from a dilapidated temple to a tile house. He said: "Not only the eighty households in our village say that Chairman Mao is good, but my old mother also says that Chairman Mao is really kind to the poor." An old lady in Tiantaishan, Feixiang, was given six mu of flower land, and she said happily: "I will live in the fields and never leave. I will guard my land day and night and watch my flowers grow! In the past, they all said that offering to the God of Wealth could bring good fortune, and I was deceived into burning incense and kowtowing all day long, but I was still poor. Since the Eighth Route Army came, my life has been getting better day by day." In Dongguan Town, Gucheng, more than 310 families had 97 families who believed in Taoism. Guan Zhenfang's family was superstitious and burned four liang of sesame oil and one jin of paper money every month, which also wasted a lot of time. After the mass movement, Guan's family worked hard in production and no longer sought blessings from gods. The number of Taoists in the village is also decreasing day by day.

    The Peasant Masses are Truly Dear
    After the peasants of Bei Qianzhuang, Jixian County, were liberated, everyone ate a unity meal. While eating, everyone discussed the liberation and Chairman Mao. They all said, "The people of the peasant association must love and help each other and always be one family, and must listen to Chairman Mao's words." The peasant association in Wang Haizhuang launched a mutual aid and friendship movement. If anyone had a major event (marriage, funeral, building a house, etc.), they would help each other. Member Zhang Yuqing was ill and took a lot of medicine. The peasant association was afraid that he would spend all the fruits of his labor and become poor again, so everyone donated 2,350 yuan to help him. After Wang Tang, a member of the peasant association in Xiaoma Zhuang, Chengci, died of illness, in order to take care of his family, the members of the peasant association donated more than 4,000 yuan for the funeral.

　　农民们第一次尝到幸福
    新华社冀南分社
    冀南新区农民翻身运动已经燃遍二十多县，含辛茹苦的农民们第一次尝到什么是幸福，脸上再没有愁苦了，他们这才知道了人生的真欢乐。
    努力生产栽富根
    临漳城内北街经过反奸反贪污斗争，群众分到果实，在“栽富根”号召下都积极生产起来。从来不纺织的妇女们已买到六十辆纺车，走进任何一家都可以听到嗡嗡的响声。邯郸贵龙岗经过反奸霸斗争，一百零二户赤、贫农每人平均获得三亩土地，他们的生产情绪提高了，秋收时组织了互助组，六百亩高粱四天即收割完毕。老汉张士礼为了增产天天拾粪，他提着粪筐走到那里，歌颂毛主席和翻身的歌声便唱到那里。广平新花管农民分到果实后，家家建盖新房。该村往年过秋时，经常有十亩二十亩的庄稼被人偷掉，但今年却一点也没有人偷，人人都说：“毛主席治化的真好。”
    一改荒凉为人财两旺
    广平平庄后街地主张家砖房的附近，过去常是商人、小贩、娱乐班、和玩把戏的………人们集中之地，地主们终日在寻求欢快，南街是个贫民窟，矮矮的的破土房荒荒凉凉，从来看不见笑脸。而今人们微笑的赶着牲口不断进出，鸡猪满街，时闻歌声。商人小贩也都赶到南街来，南街已成为全村的繁华中心。永年娄上村群众翻身后，十三户赤贫、二十户贫民均上升为中农。一个雇工活了四十岁娶不起媳妇，冷落了半生，如今翻了身，有了地种，也娶了媳妇。脸上终日表现着不可抑止的欢欣。
    家家和睦人人欢喜
    广平南张村在以前三天两头不是你打孩子，就是我打老婆，或是婆媳吵闹。到处都是吵骂或哭声，原因多是为了一个“穷”。现在改变了。参议员李和生老婆半辈子不好好过日子，和婆母长年不和，现在却积极织布了。赵海母亲以前整天和儿媳生气，现在也好了。军属代表王立明儿媳因为家贫，不好好过，曾跑过一次，现在也安心过日子，天天纺花织布。老汉路光东分了二亩地，兴奋的在群众集会场所常常唱起梆子腔。一个婆婆说：“有了毛主席，我不愁饿死了，我得多活几年。”
    欢庆中秋迷信打破
    中秋佳节，农民都把这一天作为翻身的纪念日。买月饼、包饺子、烹肉菜，非常丰盛。还召开大会，踩高跷、唱秧歌、耍花车，闹了很多玩艺儿。临漳大善村是天主教徒最多的村子，翻身后每个农民平均有了三亩一分地，百分之八十七的农民涌入农会，他们对天主感到有些渺茫，都说：“毛主席才是真正的救世主”。中秋节全村农民开翻身庆祝大会，请来王耳庄的高跷和一个说大鼓书的，人人欢天喜地。贫民武相卿在桌上讲话，把他过去生活和今天生活作了对比，接着他唱：“八月十五是中秋，穷老百姓抬起头，今天开的快乐会，翻身胜利福禄寿。”农会副主任武金科翻身后，从破庙里搬到瓦房里，他说：“不但咱村八十户农会说毛主席好，我家中的老娘也说毛主席对穷人真亲”。肥乡天台山一个老太太分了六亩花地，她喜的说：“俺住到地里不走了，黑夜白日守着俺这块地，看着俺的花长吧！先前都说供财神能给增福，哄的我成天烧香叩头也是受穷。八路军来了，我的日子一天比一天好了。一故城东关镇三百一十多家有九十七家在道，关振芳一家迷信，每月用香油四两、火纸一斤烧香，还得耽误很多时间，群运后关家都努力生产，不再向神求福了。村中在道的也日益减少。
    农民群众真亲爱
    冀县北骞庄农民翻身后，大家吃了一顿团结饭。吃饭时大家闹闹嚷嚷，讨论着翻身的事，讨论着毛主席。都说：“农会的人都要亲爱互助、永成一家，都要听毛主席的话。”王海庄农会开展了互助友爱运动，谁要有了大事（婚、丧、盖房等），都互相帮助。会员张玉青病了，吃了很多药，农会怕他把分的果实花光，又穷了，大家便捐了两千三百五十元帮助他。成磁小马庄农会员王堂病死后，为照顾其家中老小，农会会员们便捐了四千多元助丧。
