　　[Our Newspaper] Shanghai News: Rural writer Zhao Shuli's famous work "Changes in Li Family Village" is soon to be published in Shanghai, with a preface written by Mr. Guo Moruo. It is also reported that an American publishing company plans to translate it into English and publish it in the United States. Zhao's other famous work, "Rhymes of Li Youcai," has been published three times in Shanghai and has sold out completely. People who cannot buy it are looking everywhere to borrow it, and young people are eagerly passing it around. It has injected new serum into the literary world, and everyone is even more longing for the happiness of life and freedom of writing in the Liberated Areas. The publication and distribution of Zhao's excellent literary works in Shanghai have encountered many obstacles from the Jiang government authorities. In other places outside Shanghai, it is not even allowed to be sold, which further increases the hatred of young people and literary workers in various places towards the Chinese fascists.

    【本报讯】沪讯：农村作家赵树理的名著《李家庄的变迁》最近将要在上海出版，已经由郭沫若先生作了序。并闻美国某出版公司拟将其译成英文，在美出版。赵氏另一名著《李有才板话》在沪连出三版都已销售一空，买不到的人到处寻找借阅，青年群中争相传诵，并给文艺界注射进了新的血清，大家对于解放区生活的幸福和写作的自由也因此更为向往。赵氏这些优秀的文艺作品在上海的出版和发行遭遇了蒋政府当局的许多阻难，在上海以外其他地方甚至不准出售，这更增加各地青年和文艺工作者对中国法西斯分子的憎恨。
