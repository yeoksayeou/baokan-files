　　[This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7th dispatch] Amidst the extremely fierce self-defense counter-attack war in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the people of Feicheng, Qingfeng, and Puyang counties have launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic military enlistment movement to defend their homes and villages. As of now, 5,000 patriotic youths have stepped onto the front lines. Zhao, the district chief of the seventh district of Feicheng, took the lead in enlisting, and various districts have proposed competitions. Representatives from the Fourth District Office have proposed the following challenges on behalf of the masses of the entire district: (1) Each district should establish a "Liberation Battalion" of 300 or more people. The Fourth District is too large, so a "Liberation Regiment" should be established. (2) The fruits of struggle should be distributed in advance, and military families should be given first priority. The masses and cadres of the Fourth District unanimously stated that they want to establish a "Liberation Regiment" of 600 or more people, with the new soldiers of Wangzhuang neighborhood as the first battalion, Tunhu neighborhood as the second battalion, and Binmazhuang neighborhood as the third battalion. The regiment headquarters has now been established in Shujia Garden, with a large flag flying in the sky, reading: "Brave Men Protect Their Hometowns and Go to the Battlefield." Other districts have also proposed organizing "Liberation Battalions," with each battalion having 350 or more people. Currently, 1,800 new soldiers from the county have arrived at the military sub-district. Thousands of people in Feicheng gathered in the streets to send off the new soldiers. For a time, red flags fluttered, and drums and gongs shook the sky. The new soldiers shouted along the way, "We are the people's army, and we will not return home until we crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." The military enlistment movement in Qingfeng County is also extremely enthusiastic, with 1,646 people having enlisted. Many role models have emerged in the enlistment process. Chen Qiaoyun, the women's association group leader of Liutun in the Fourth District, persuaded her husband to enlist and told him at the farewell rally: "Don't you dare sneak back halfway. If you lose face, I will lose even more face. You must go honorably, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and then return victoriously." Gao Guanxian, the village chief of Jinzaoge Village in the Ninth District, mobilized his own son to return to the army and brought two other youths with him. Lü Feng and his son from Niejiachuang in the Second District enlisted together. Wang Zhanchao, a disabled veteran from Shaipengzhuang in the Ninth District, and two others went to the battlefield for the second time. Wang Jinjiao, the propaganda committee member of the Wuquangu Women's Association, and Liu Guixiang, the group leader, personally sent their husbands to enlist with livestock. Cao Peizhai, a teacher at Hancun Elementary School, led many students to enlist. The military enlistment movement has spread throughout Qingfeng County. In Yanggu, youth enlistment in various districts is also surging. More than sixty natural villages in the Seventh District alone have seen 160 youths enlist, and a total of 761 people have enlisted in the county.
　　[This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 5th dispatch] At the Taixi Self-Defense War Cadre Mobilization Meeting, County Chief Han took the lead in enlisting, followed by District Chief Ma of the Seventh District, District Chief Li of the Third District, Comrade Shao Ke (female), neighborhood leader Wang Zhao of Mazhuang, neighborhood mass leader Song Qifeng of Di'er, and others, totaling eleven people, who immediately signed up to take the lead in enlisting. Everyone unanimously stated that the people have suffered all kinds of hardships during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. If Chiang Kai-shek's and the United States' collusion in attacking the liberated areas is not repelled, not only will the masses not be able to turn over a new leaf, but there is also the danger of national subjugation. County Chief Han also called on everyone to actively lead the masses to enlist and establish the Taixi Brothers Liberation Regiment.
　　[This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 6th dispatch] In Juye Zhuguan Village, on the basis of liberation, a surge of enthusiasm for enlisting in the army has been set off. At the Farmers' Association members' meeting, people said: "Our liberation was turned over from under the bad guys. Chiang Kai-shek's army is going to attack us and wants to stand on our heads and shit. We must completely turn over and defeat the Chiang bandits." Then, a symposium of activists was held, and everyone reflected on their present and yesterday. Liu Hongchang, the deputy director of the Farmers' Association, said: "In the past, I only had two mu of land. Now I have twenty mu. In the past, when I walked on the street, no one greeted me. Now, everywhere people greet me." Liu Honglu continued, "I didn't even have a decent nickname in the past. People called me Blind Honglu when they saw me. Now that I am a member of the Farmers' Association, everyone calls me uncle and grandpa. We can have a good life because the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army gave it to us. To defeat old Chiang and protect our rice bowls, we must join the Eighth Route Army." Three people sent their sons to enlist on the spot. In these three days, pigs were slaughtered and distributed to military families, and members of various departments also had a meal together. Everyone shouted: We must enlist well and strengthen the people's soldiers. One person drank a cup of wine and said: "Defeat old Chiang's offensive." Another person ate a piece of meat and said: "Work with him." On that day, eleven young men signed up to enlist. The village also established an enlistment committee to solve the difficulties of the new soldiers. On the day of the farewell, a meeting of all district Farmers' Association members and gun squad members was held in the village, inviting new soldiers to eat. A liberation flag was planted outside the door, and there was blowing and beating. Seventeen more people signed up to enlist on the spot.
