　　Remedying Autumn Flooding Crop Failure
    Southern Hebei Rushes to Plant Autumn Wheat
    Farmers' Associations Help Military Families with Planting and Prioritize Planting for Them
    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch, 17th] The peasants of Southern Hebei, who have been liberated, are now rushing to plant wheat with joyous hearts. After the peasants of Dongwangdong Town in Ningnan recovered more than 1,700 mu of land seized by landlords, their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented heights. They have now all joined the movement to rush to plant autumn wheat. The village farmers' association is also helping families of soldiers and those newly liberated to solve the difficulties of planting wheat. A total of 12.5 shi of wheat seeds were distributed to 40 households of martyrs and military families (191 people). A total of 11.5 shi of wheat seeds were distributed to 87 poor peasant households (276 people). Old lady Xia, with her silver hair, said: "We have been given houses and land, and now wheat seeds. I have never heard of such a thing in thousands of years. I have lived for seventy years, and I want to live a few more years to enjoy a happy life. I wholeheartedly want to protect Chairman Mao." There is a lot of saline-alkali land in Yincai Village, and most of the village's land was flooded this year, resulting in a reduced autumn harvest. After a detailed calculation by the village cadres, only 14 out of 89 households in the village have enough food for a year. This calculation boosted everyone's enthusiasm for planting wheat, and they all said, "Plant more wheat this year, so that we can get ahead next year." In Dongliuxia Village, Jize Third District, under the call of the model of diligence and thrift, Qi Fuping, the whole village plans to plant wheat on 90% of the cultivated land. Labor model Nie Sen of Xiliu Village is leading the whole village to plant wheat on 80% of the cultivated land. Under the leadership of the director of the farmers' association, Beifengzheng Village rushed to plant 2,400 mu of wheat in ten days. Qian Guotun Village completed the sowing of all wheat fields in thirteen days, and plowed them more carefully than in any previous year. Before rushing to plant wheat, Renxian also reviewed the work of supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to their families. Each village established a committee for supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to their families, and also allocated 200,000 jin of wheat seeds to military families. The First District even specifically stipulated a "rush day" for planting wheat for military families. Village cadres from Guo Village and Qi Village personally helped military families plant wheat, saying, "When eating rice, don't forget the people who planted the grain." Even if we don't plant our own land, we must first plant wheat for military families. The Yuan Dynasty county government personally led the masses near the village to dig through the Shunshui Ditch of Majia River, increasing the area of wheat land by 1,500 mu.

　　补救秋泛歉收
    冀南各地抢种秋麦
    农会帮助军属种并尽先代种
    【本报威县十七日电】翻身后的冀南农民，正以欢快的心情突击种麦。宁南东汪东镇农民收回地主剥夺土地一千七百余亩后，生产情绪空前高涨。现已全部卷入抢种秋麦的运动中。该村农会并帮助抗属和刚翻身的农民解决种麦困难。计四十户烈属军工家属（一百九十一人），共分得麦种十二石五斗。八十七户贫农（二百七十六人）共分得麦种十一石五斗。鬓发如银的夏老太太说：“分了房子分地，又分麦种，千年万年没听说过这事。俺活了七十岁啦，还想多活上几年，享享清福。俺一心一意要保毛主席。”尹才庄沙碱地很多，今年全村大部土地被水淹了，大秋减收。经村干部具体计算，全村八十九户仅十四户够一年吃。这一算把大家种麦劲头提起来了，都说：“今年多种麦，明年早接劲。”鸡泽三区东柳下村，在勤俭模范齐福平的号召下，全村计划种麦占耕地百分之九十。西柳村劳动模范聂森领导全村要种麦占耕地百分之八十。北风正村在农会主任领导下，十天内突击种麦两千四百亩。前郭屯村十三天内完成全部麦地的播种，并且犁得比以往任何一年都精细。任县在突击种麦前，并检讨了优抗工作，各村成立了优抗委员会，还拨给军属二十万斤麦种。一区更具体规定为军属种麦“突击日”。郭村、齐村村干部亲自帮军属种麦说：“吃米不忘种谷人。”自己地不种也得先给军属种上麦子。元朝县府亲自领导驻村附近群众挖通马夹河的顺水沟，增种麦地一千五百亩。
