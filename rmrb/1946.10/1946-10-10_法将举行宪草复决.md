Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. TASS, Paris, 6th: Preparations for the referendum vote on the new constitutional draft in Paris and other cities have been completed. Major political parties have held meetings among their voters. Only the Popular Republican Movement has not yet participated in this movement. The party appears very dismayed due to its conflict with De Gaulle. The difficulty it faces is that, on the one hand, it does not want a final break with De Gaulle, who opposes the new constitutional draft; on the other hand, the party cannot but uphold the new constitution, because its representatives in the Constituent Assembly agreed to it. On October 1st, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party convened a conference, at which the leader of the French Communist Party, Thorez, formally expounded the FCP's attitude toward the new constitution. He said: Thanks to the firm and prudent policy of the Communist Party, the plans of domestic and international reactionaries to split the working class and isolate the Communist Party have been defeated. After the new constitutional draft was passed in parliament, the reactionaries themselves were isolated. De Gaulle today stands with the reactionary forces. In his recent speech, it was filled with hatred for democratic forces and fear of the people. Now De Gaulle has become the banner of the reactionaries. In addition to dozens of people who suffered a disastrous defeat in the election, these reactionaries also include Daladier, Reynaud, and all fascists. In conclusion, Thorez urged the Communist Party not to give De Gaulle's reactionaries the opportunity to amend the constitution in a reactionary direction. The "Republican Liberty Party" (presumably the fascist big bourgeoisie party) also held a meeting, calling for opposition to the new constitutional draft. They said that De Gaulle's speech has strengthened the party's position. De Gaulle said in his speech in Nibinar on September 29th that the new constitution was not good, which put the "De Gaulle League" in a difficult situation. Therefore, the League has now begun to disintegrate, and more than 300 activists have defected in just the past few days. It is reported that the new French constitution was passed by the National Assembly on the 29th of last month with 440 votes against 106 votes. This constitution will be put to a national referendum vote by voters on the 13th of this month.

　　法将举行宪草复决
    【新华社延安七日电】塔斯社巴黎六日讯：巴黎及其他城市的复决新宪草投票筹备工作已经办妥，各重要政党均在其选民中举行了会议。只有人民共和党尚未参加这一运动。该党由于和戴高乐的冲突而显得很沮丧，该党所面临的困难是一面不愿和戴高乐最后破裂，而戴氏是反对新宪草的；另方面该党又不能不维护新宪法，因为它的代表们在立宪议会中同意了它。十月一日法共中央召集了大会，会上法共领袖多列士正式阐述了法共对新宪的态度，他说：由于共产党坚定与慎重的政策，法国国内与国际反动派分裂工人阶级孤立共产党的计划已被打败。新宪草在议会通过后，反动分子自己却被孤立起来了。戴高乐今天和反动力量站在一起，在他最近的演说中，充满了对民主力量的憎恨与对人民的恐惧。现在戴高乐成了反动派的旗子，这些反动分子除了几十个在选举上遭受惨败的以外，尚有达拉第、雷诺及所有法希分子。多列士在结语中敦促共产党不要给戴高乐反动派以顺着反动方向修改宪法的机会。“共和自由党”（按系法西斯大资产阶级党）也召开了会议，号召反对新宪草，他们说戴高乐的演说已加强了该党的地位。戴高乐在九月二十九日尼比纳尔演说中说新宪不好，这使“戴高乐联盟”陷于困难境地，因此该联盟现已开始分崩，仅过去数日中即有三百余名活动分子，脱离而去。按法国新宪草是于上月二十九日经国民议会以四百四十票对一百零六票通过。此一宪法将于本月十三日举行全国选民投票复决。
