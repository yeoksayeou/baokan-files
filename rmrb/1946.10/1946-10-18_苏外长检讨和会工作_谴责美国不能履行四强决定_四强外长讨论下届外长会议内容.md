Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Paris - After the first weekly break in the "long night meetings" of the past two weeks, the Peace Conference Plenary Session held its final meeting on the 13th to discuss the last of the five-nation peace treaties, the Finnish treaty. The meeting was not as smooth as expected. Due to a proposal by the U.S. representative to reduce Finland's reparations to the Soviet Union from $300 million to $200 million, a heated debate ensued. The Foreign Minister of Byelorussia accused the United States of being generous at the expense of the Soviet Union. U.S. representative Vandenberg then vigorously defended the U.S. proposal, saying that the U.S. was willing to leave it to history to judge whether the U.S. proposal was appropriate. When Vandenberg spoke, according to a UPI reporter, he was "like a defendant in the dock." The last speaker was Molotov, who reviewed the work of the Peace Conference, saying that since the opening of the Peace Conference until its closing day, there had always been a group of representatives who intended to order others around. Reviewing several matters on which the four-power meeting had failed to reach an agreement, he emphasized: "If more effort had been made to reach an agreement, the results today would have been better." He reiterated that the Soviet Union insisted on opposing the Peace Conference's decisions on the Danube, the Greek-Albanian border, and other issues: "These decisions are not conducive to peace, and the Council of Foreign Ministers will inevitably not approve them." Molotov expressed regret that the United States could not consistently agree with the four-power decision at the Peace Conference, but he believed that the Peace Conference had good results and proved the necessity of good relations between large and small countries. Speaking of the Finnish treaty, he emphasized that since Finland overthrew its fascist group, the Soviet Union had treated it generously. He said that Vandenberg was today attempting to use Finland as a pawn of American policy, slandering Finland as having been invited into a certain bloc by a false gesture of friendship. The Soviet Union despised Vandenberg's gesture and was willing to continue sincere friendly relations with Finland. Activities to divide large and small countries will continue to be strongly opposed by the Soviet Union. Molotov praised Wallace for his support of international cooperation in the United States. When the plenary session voted on the Finnish treaty, the U.S. proposal to reduce reparations was not voted on because it was submitted after the deadline for proposals. After the discussion and voting on the five-nation peace treaties, the Peace Conference Plenary Session is scheduled to hold a closing ceremony at 2:00 p.m. today, which will be presided over by French Foreign Minister Bidault.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Paris - The four foreign ministers held a meeting at the French Foreign Ministry at 6:00 p.m. on the 14th. Molotov attended with Vyshinsky and Gusev, while Byrnes was accompanied by Connally, Vandenberg, and Byrnes' special assistant Bohlen. The main topic of the meeting was to discuss the content of the next foreign ministers conference. The four foreign ministers unanimously agreed that the next foreign ministers conference would be held in New York on November 4th to formulate the final text of the five-nation peace treaties, and decided that the drafting committee of the conference, including four-power experts, would begin work on the "Aquitania" ship transporting them to New York. Based on the previous decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers and the recommendations of all parties at the Peace Conference, the text of the peace treaties will be drafted for submission to the Council of Foreign Ministers for discussion. The meeting also discussed the German question. Both Molotov and Bidault stated that due to technical reasons, the discussion of the German question should be held in Europe rather than in New York. Byrnes then agreed, but also argued that a preliminary discussion should be held in New York. Finally, the meeting unanimously agreed that when the four foreign ministers meet in New York, they will hold a preliminary discussion at the end of November to determine the time and place for a thorough study of the issue, listing the German problems that need to be resolved.

　　苏外长检讨和会工作
    谴责美国不能履行四强决定   
    四强外长讨论下届外长会议内容
    【新华社延安十五日电】巴黎讯：经过了两周以来的“长夜会议”中的第一个星期例假之后，和会全体会议于十三日举行其讨论五国和约中最后一个对芬和约的最后一次会议。会议并未如事先一般预料那样风平浪静，由于美国代表提议要求芬兰对苏赔偿额应自三亿美元减至二亿美元，又展开一场激辩。白俄罗斯外长指责美国以牺牲苏联而慷他人之慨。美代表范登堡继之亟力辩护美方之建议，他说：关于美国建议是否恰当，美国愿留待历史裁判。范氏发言时，据合众社记者称：“有如在罪人席上的被告”。最后发言者为莫洛托夫，他追述和会的工作时称：和会在开幕以来，直至闭幕之日，总是有一批代表意图号令别人。他在检讨四强会上未获协议的若干事项时，强调说：“假如能在获致协议方面多加努力，则今日之结果当较为良好。”他重申苏联坚持反对和会关于多瑙河、希保边界等问题的决定：“这些决定无益于和平，外长会议势必不予批准。”莫洛托夫对于美国在和会上不能始终赞同四强决定一事，表示遗憾，但他认为和会已有良好结果，并证明大小国家间有良好关系之必要。谈及对芬和约时，他强调自芬兰推翻其法西斯集团的统治以来，苏联即宽大相待。他说范登堡今日企图利用芬兰为美国政策的爪牙，竟污蔑芬兰已被虚伪的友谊姿态请入某一集团。苏联蔑视范氏这种姿态，而愿意与芬兰继续真诚的友好关系。分裂大小国之活动，今后仍将遭受苏联之坚强的反对。莫洛托夫对华莱士在美国支持国际合作一事，予以赞扬。全会于表决对芬和约时，对美国关于减少赔偿的提案未予表决，因该提案系在提案截止期之后提出者。在五国和约讨论与表决完结后，和会全体会议已定于今日下午二时举行闭幕礼，届时法外长比道尔将主持仪式。
    【新华社延安十五日电】巴黎讯：四强外长于十四日下午六时在法国外交部举行会议，莫洛托夫偕维辛斯基及古赛夫出席，与贝纳斯同来者有康纳利、范登堡及贝氏特别助理波亨。会上主要为讨论下次外长会议之内容，四外长一致同意下次外长会议于十一月四日在纽约举行，以制订五国和约的最后条文，并决定包括四强专家的和会起草委员会，将在运送他们赴纽约的“阿圭坦尼亚”号船上开始工作。根据前次外长会议决定及和会各方建议，订制和约正文，以便提交外长会议讨论。会上又谈及德国问题的讨论，莫洛托夫及比道尔皆表示由于技术上的原因，德国问题的讨论应在欧洲而不在纽约举行。贝纳斯乃表示同意，但又主张在纽约作初步讨论，最后会议一致赞成四外长在纽约集会时，将于十一月底作初步讨论，以确订彻底研究该问题的时间和地点，列举须待解决的德国问题。
