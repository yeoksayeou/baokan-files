　　Wangwu Militia War Team
    Penetrates Enemy Lines to Capture Chiang Kai-shek's Spies
    [This dispatch from Yangcheng, 13th] After Chiang Kai-shek's troops invaded Yuanqu, the Wangwu Second District immediately formed three militia companies, rotating them for combat in the Bai'e and Yuanshang areas to persist in the struggle in the border regions. On September 25th, the militia, in coordination with local military groups, defeated the 90th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek troops that invaded Wangwuyu. Another militia unit penetrated deep into Hucun and arrested Chiang Kai-shek's intelligence officer Wang Zigong and special agent Qin Degong, along with thirteen others. After the victory at Wangziyu, morale was greatly boosted. The masses in six villages, including Beiyang, spontaneously formed a 200-person support team to help harvest crops in the border areas of Yingyan and Wunu. In one day, they harvested 300 mu of millet. In five days, 2,000 mu of grain in villages such as Yuanshang and Bai'e was harvested, and 8,000 mu of dry wheat had been sown.
