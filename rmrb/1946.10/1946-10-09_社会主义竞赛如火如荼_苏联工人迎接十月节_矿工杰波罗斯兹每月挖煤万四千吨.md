　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Moscow dispatch: The 29th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution Day (November 7th) is approaching, and tens of millions of Soviet workers have already participated in the traditional socialist competition launched for this anniversary. In the Donets Coal Basin, coal miners are launching this competition. When worker Idjetov achieved 9,000 tons of coal extracted per month, three times the average monthly coal extraction of other workers, Dzebolosz has now created a new record with 14,000 tons of coal extracted per month. Steel factories in Uzbekistan and Siberia have guaranteed to refine 9,000 tons per person before the October Revolution Day, exceeding the original plan. The output of coal and steel in the Nikopol Basin has greatly exceeded the plan, and the miners there have guaranteed to complete the 1946 production plan by December 1st. In the Urals and Molotov City and other places, the socialist competition is in full swing.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Moscow dispatch: The first of this month marked the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet First Automobile Factory (i.e., the Moscow Stalin Factory) and the Orjonikidze Tractor Factory in Kharkov. Before the revolution, the Soviet Union had no automobile factories. The Stalin Automobile Factory has become a first-class factory in 15 years, and its products are no less than those of other countries in the world. The products of the Molotov Automobile Factory are comparable to it. Before the war, the two factories produced tens of thousands of cars annually. Now the Stalin Factory has been fully restored. From 1950, the factory will produce 100,000 cars a year. At that time, there will be ten automobile factories in the Soviet Union, and the total output of automobiles will be 500,000. The Orjonikidze Tractor Factory is one of the largest factories in the world. Before the war, it produced tens of thousands of tractors every year. It was almost completely destroyed by the German invaders during the war, and now it is being rebuilt and restored with the latest methods. At the same time, tractors are continuing to be produced. By 1950, the factory will produce 25,000 tractors annually. The five machine tool construction factories in Leningrad, Kharkov, Kramatorsk, Odessa, and Kiev will be able to regain their pre-war output this year. Each factory will produce 3,500 to 4,000 different automatic machine tools each year. The equipment of these factories, which have been resurrected from destruction, is better than before the war. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the output of these factories will increase by 20% to 30% compared with the pre-war level.

　　社会主义竞赛如火如荼
    苏联工人迎接十月节
    矿工杰波罗斯兹每月挖煤万四千吨
    【新华社延安四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联十月革命节（十一月七日）二十九周年将到，成千万的苏联工人已参加了为该纪念日而发起的传统的社会主义竞赛。在顿尼兹煤矿盆地，挖煤工人正展开这种竞赛，当工人伊杰托夫获得了每月挖九千吨煤为其他工人每月平均挖煤数的三倍时，杰波罗斯兹现在又以每月挖一万四千吨煤创造了最高纪录。乌兹贝克及西伯利亚的钢铁工厂，保证在十月革命节前每人要炼九千吨，超过原订计划。尼科坡尔盆地煤与钢的产量，都大大超过计划，该地矿工保证到十二月一日，即完成一九四六年的生产计划。在乌拉尔及莫洛托夫城等地，社会主义竞赛正如火似荼的展开。
    【新华社延安四日电】莫斯科讯：本月一日为苏联第一汽车厂（即莫斯科斯大林厂）及哈尔科夫之奥尔章尼奇兹拖拉机工厂创立十五周年。革命前苏联没有汽车厂，斯大林汽车厂在十五年内已成为第一流的工厂，其产品并不次于世界上其他国家。莫洛托夫汽车厂的出品可与之媲美。战前二厂每年出产数万汽车，现在斯大林厂已全部恢复，一九五○年起，该厂一年将出产十万辆汽车，那时全苏联将有十个汽车厂，汽车出产总数为五十万辆。奥尔章尼奇兹拖拉机工厂，是世界最大的工厂之一，战前每年出产数万架拖拉机，战时被德寇摧毁殆尽，现在正在以最新式的方针加以重建与恢复，同时拖拉机又在继续出产了，到一九五○年，该厂每年产品将达二万五千架。在列宁格勒哈尔科夫及拉马托尔斯克、奥德塞及基辅之五个机器工具建筑工厂，今年即可重新达到战前之产量，每厂每年将出产三千五百至四千各种不同的自动机器工具。在毁灭中复活之各该工厂，其装备较战前更好，五年计划结束时，各该工厂产量将比战前水平增加百分之二十至三十。
