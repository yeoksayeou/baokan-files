　　Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 4th: In September, the Shandong militia, in their intertwined struggle along the Jiaoji, Jinpu, and Longhai railway lines, annihilated over 1,300 Chiang troops, captured over 150 Chiang soldiers (including a company commander of the 336th Regiment of the 12th Army), and seized one 60mm mortar, 25 small cannons, over 50 light and heavy machine guns (including six American-made carbines), and over 200 rifles and short guns. Anti-nibbling, elimination of traitors, and explosions were the three major characteristics of militia activities. The Chiang army's 54th Army garrisoned in Jiaoxian City established strongholds in Yue Village south of the city, Hejia Village west of the city, and Dazhuang Village east of the city, but were constantly attacked by the militia. After three repairs and three flattenings, they finally retreated into the city. Chiang's puppet troops in Jimo built bunkers in Chengshudun and other places east of the city, attempting to use them as strongholds for gradual advancement, but they could not withstand the militia's explosions, and the large and small bunkers successively turned into piles of ruins. While the Chiang army suffered setbacks in the aforementioned areas and were caught off guard, the militia in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway also became active, once reaching right up to the Longhai Railway, killing and wounding over 30 Chiang soldiers. When Chiang's armored vehicles arrived and fired blindly, the militia had long since disappeared. The Lunan militia on the Yunhe front and the Jiaodong militia on the outskirts of Weixian County laid minefields everywhere. Chiang soldiers inside the city said to each other, "We have to go out, but going out means losing our lives!"

　　Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 4th: Since the Zibo mining area was occupied by the Chiang army, workers and people have organized explosion teams and launched guerrilla warfare. Among them, Gao Yuncheng's explosions are the most outstanding. His reputation shook the Chiang army in Zibo. The common people give him a thumbs-up when they mention him, praising him as "top-notch." In the twenty days from the end of August to mid-September, he planted mines three times and hit three times. On August 25th, taking advantage of the moonlit autumn night, he led his team to the vicinity of the Zibo Power Plant and, within five minutes, buried two large iron eggs weighing 25 kilograms each inside the newly built blockhouse south of the power plant. The next day, when the Chiang army sentries went to their posts in the blockhouse, it blossomed with the sound of thunder. On September 1st, he buried two large landmines midway between Batu and Heishan (ten li north of Batu). The next day, with two loud bangs, seven Chiang soldiers were blown to pieces. On the 15th, he led two squads, under the dim moonlight, sneaked into the Huangjia Dawa in Boshan, the Chiang army's usual gathering place every morning, and planted five landmines in a plum-blossom pattern. The next morning, when the Chiang army gathered as usual, there was a sudden roar, wounding over 20 Chiang soldiers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 4th: The people in various places along the western section of the Jiaoji Railway have widely organized armed work teams, active on the three-hundred-li front extending west from Jinan, east to Zhangdian, and south to Zibo. Armed work teams in Licheng and Zhangqiu counties have recovered hundreds of villages. In Boshan Chengguan, Shentou Power Plant, Zhangdian Railway Station, and other places, various slogans and leaflets warning the Chiang army are frequently found, making the Chiang army feel uneasy and restless. In September, they captured over 90 Chiang army stragglers and special agents, all of whom were released after education. On the 26th, a unit of the armed work team suddenly entered Cichun Village, twenty-five li west of Zichuan City, and seized a large batch of documents. That evening, they raided Shangjiazhuang, repelled over 100 Chiang soldiers, captured a telephone exchange and 200 kilograms of telephone wire, eliminated the Chiang-controlled "Township Office," killed the head of the "Love-the-Homeland Corps," and protected the masses' autumn harvest and autumn plowing.

　　Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 4th: Local armed forces and militia in the Bohai area launched a surprise attack on the Chiang army strongholds west of Zouping City and more than ten li north of Zhangqiu on the night of the 24th of last month, annihilating a battalion of the 13th Army of Chiang and two companies of the Independent 10th Division, capturing more than 140 of them alive, and seizing 11 machine guns and more than 140 rifles.

　　山东民兵月歼蒋军千余
    渤海民兵夜袭邹平歼蒋军一营两连
    【新华社临沂四日电】九月份山东民兵在沿胶济、津浦、陇海三线各地的犬牙交错斗争中，共歼灭蒋军一千三百余名，生擒蒋军十二军三三六团连长以下一百五十余名，缴获六零炮一门，小炮二十五门，轻重机枪五十余挺（内有美制卡宾式六挺），长短枪二百余支。反蚕食除奸与爆炸为民兵活动的三大特色。胶县城蒋军五十四军所部在城南岳庄、城西赫家屯、城东大庄等地设置据点，时遭民兵打击，三修三平，终于缩进城内。即墨蒋伪军在城东橙树墩等地构筑碉堡，想以此为据点，步步推进，但抵不住民兵的爆炸，大小碉堡相继变成一堆废墟。在上述各地蒋军遭受打击，顾此失彼之际，陇海东段民兵也活跃起来，有一次直至陇海路跟前，毙伤蒋军三十余名。当蒋军铁甲车赶到盲目射击时，民兵早已不知去向。鲁南民兵在运河前线，胶东民兵在潍县外围，到处布置地雷阵，城内蒋军对人说：“不出去不行，出去就得送命！”
    【新华社临沂四日电】自淄博矿区被蒋军侵占后，职工和人民纷纷组织爆炸队，展开游击战，其中以高运成爆炸为最出色，威名震动淄博蒋军，老百姓一提到他就翘起大拇指来，赞誉“顶刮刮”。八月底到九月中的二十天内，三埋三中。八月二十五日，乘秋夜月色，他带领队员奔向淄博发电厂附近，五分钟内就将两颗二十五斤重的大铁蛋埋进发电厂南新修的炮楼内，第二天蒋军哨兵上岗炮楼，便随着雷声一起开了花。九月一日，他在八徒到黑山（八徒北十里）中途埋大地雷两颗，翌日两声巨响，七名蒋军炸得粉身碎骨。十五日，他带了两个小队，在夜色迷蒙中潜入蒋军每晨的集合地点博山黄家大洼，梅花瓣式的埋了五颗地雷。翌晨蒋军照例集合，只听轰然一阵巨响，伤蒋军二十余名。
    【新华社临沂四日电】胶济西线各地人民广泛组织武工队，活跃在西起济南、东迄张店、南至淄博的三百余里战线上，历城、章邱两县武工队已恢复数百座村庄，博山城关、神头发电厂、张店车站等地经常发现他们告诫蒋军的各种标语和传单，使蒋军提心吊胆，坐卧不安。九月份他们共捕获蒋军零星武装特务九十余名，均经教育后释放。二十六日武工队一部突入淄川城西二十五里之磁村，缴获文件一大宗。是日晚，复奔袭商家庄，击退蒋军百余名，缴获电话总机一部，电线二百斤，消灭蒋记“乡公所”，击毙“爱乡团”团长，保卫了群众的秋收秋耕。
    【新华社临沂四日电】渤海区地方武装及民兵于上月二十四日夜猛袭邹平城西关及章邱北十余里蒋军据点，歼灭蒋军十三军一个营，及独立第十师两个连，生擒其一百四十余名，缴获机枪十一挺，步枪一百四十余支。
