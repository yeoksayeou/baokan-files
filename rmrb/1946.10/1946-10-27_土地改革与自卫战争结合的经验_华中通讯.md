　　Experiences in Combining Land Reform with Self-Defense War
　　Central China Communication

　　The path of combining land reform with the self-defense war in the First District of Suwan (Jiangsu and Anhui) varies depending on the region, generally taking three forms: (1) In central areas where work is relatively weak, land reform is generally carried out first, and on this basis, a mass movement to protect the fields is launched, and guerrilla warfare is developed. For example, in ×× District of Taixing, land reform was completed the earliest in the entire county, and this time the participation in the army was also the most enthusiastic, with more than 943 people joining the regular army, and another 800 militiamen. (2) In marginal areas, land is often distributed with one hand holding a gun, and land reform is carried out under the protection of guerrilla armed forces. For example, in ×× Township of Zishi County, there were three emergencies in one day, but they still insisted on holding group meetings; while sending people to scout, they also distributed land, and completed the entire distribution after two days and two nights of concentrated effort. In another area, when ×× Township held a meeting for poor peasants and farm laborers to distribute property on September 13th, it was suddenly attacked by 200 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, only half a mile away from the meeting place. They used a part of the masses, in cooperation with the Guo Haibo guerrilla team, to carry out sparrow warfare against the Chiang Kai-shek army, covering the continuation of the meeting. (3) In areas controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek army, where our work has been damaged, we must first achieve military victory and suppress the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek army before carrying out land reform. For example, in a certain village in Taixing, surrounded by Chiang Kai-shek army strongholds on all sides, coupled with rumors and threats from special agents, the masses, although they had a demand for land distribution, did not dare to put it forward directly. After the special agents were arrested, they confessed their mistakes to the masses and struggled against the local tyrants, and land reform was completed within three days.

　　To truly carry out land reform, it must be combined with the self-defense war, and two main obstacles must be overcome: First, cadres must lead by example and persist on the spot. For example, the masses in the suburbs of Rugao City were initially afraid to distribute land, but when the urban guerrilla team advanced to the suburbs, the poor peasants and farm laborers saw our own strength and became bolder. They all said, "We will die to distribute land." Secondly, in the minds of the cadres, we must overcome the mistaken idea that the self-defense war cannot be carried out simultaneously with land reform. Today, facts have proved that this is entirely possible. The masses in the First District of Suwan have created various methods in this regard: such as fighting guerrillas while calculating accounts in the sorghum fields; fighting guerrillas during the day and calculating accounts at night; taking turns on duty, and those at home calculating accounts and distributing land, etc., can all be adopted. Only after land reform is carried out can the people actively support the war. In the minds of the masses, obtaining land and defending land are inseparable. Therefore, when carrying out land reform or launching guerrilla warfare in marginal areas, we must grasp the people's thinking of wanting land and protecting land, and combine the two. Conversely, if the land policy is carried out in isolation from the self-defense war, it is harmful. In the self-defense war, we must seize the opportunity to carry out land reform as quickly as possible, and put forward appropriate slogans at any time according to the specific requirements of the masses. For example, when the autumn grain was about to ripen, Dongtai put forward the slogan "A day late is a year missed," so that everyone would distribute and fight quickly. After the masses obtained the land, in order to defend the fruits of victory, they all enthusiastically rushed to the front line, or participated in the rear service.

　　土地改革与自卫战争结合的经验
    华中通讯
    苏皖一分区土地改革与自卫战争结合的道路，因地区不同，大致有三种形式：（１）在工作比较弱的中心地区，一般是先进行土地改革，从这基础上开展群众保田运动，发展游击战争。如泰兴××区，在全县中完成土地改革最早，这次参军也最踊跃，参加正规军者突破九百四十三名，还有民兵八百。（２）在边缘区，往往是一手拿枪一手分田，在游击武装守卫下进行土地改革。如紫石县××乡，一天连发生三次情况，他们仍坚持分组开会；一面派人侦探，一面分配土地，经过两天两夜突击，即全部分好。又某地××乡，九月十三日在某地开贫雇农分产会议时，突遭二百余蒋军袭击，距会场仅半里。他们以一部分群众，配合郭海波游击队，对蒋军开展麻雀战，掩护了会议继续进行。（３）在蒋军势力控制下，我工作遭受破坏的地区，必先在军事上获得胜利，镇压蒋军活动，然后进行土地改革。如泰兴某村，四面为蒋军据点包围，加之特务造谣威胁，群众虽有分田要求，但不敢正面提出。后将特务逮捕起来，向群众坦白认错，并斗争了恶霸后，三天内即完成土地改革。
    要真正作到土地改革，必须与自卫战争结合，必须克服两种主要障碍：首先干部必须以身作则，就地坚持。如皋城郊群众开始不敢分田，但当城区游击队挺进到城郊活动后，贫雇农看到我们自己的力量，就壮了胆，他们都说：“我们死也要分田。”其次在干部思想上，必须克服自卫战争不能与土地改革同时进行的错误认识。今天事实证明，这完全是可能的。苏皖一分区群众，在这方面已创造了各种办法：如一面打游击，一面在高粱田里算账；白天打游击夜里算账；轮流出勤务，在家的就算账分田；男子出门，女子在家主持分田等等，均可采用。只有进行土地改革之后，人民才能积极的支援战争。在群众思想中，获得土地与保卫土地两者是分不开的。所以边缘区进行土地改革或发动游击战争时，必须掌握群众要田保田的思想，使两者结合起来。反之，土地政策如与自卫战争孤立起来进行，是有害的。在自卫战争中进行土地改革，必须抓紧时机，进行得愈快愈好，随时根据群众具体要求，提出适当口号。如在秋粮快要成熟时，东台提出“迟到一天误了一年”的口号，使大家快分快打。群众得到了土地，为保卫胜利果实，便都热烈涌上前线，或参加后勤。
