　　[This dispatch from our Changzhi Office on the first of the month reports:] The Third District of Xiangyuan, in summing up the mass movement since August in mid-September, believes that thanks to the help of the turnaround teams and the efforts of all district cadres, the biggest gain in the past month has been the uniting of the broad masses of middle peasants, turning around the chaotic situation, and putting the movement not only on the right track but also spreading it to the vast majority of villages. Of the 103 natural villages in the district, all but six have launched a liquidation movement. Among them, 54 natural villages have gone deeper and initially realized "land to the tiller," with each peasant having four to six mu of land. At the beginning of this new movement, middle peasants generally had the idea of ​​"cutting leeks" (exploiting them only once), and their emotions were very uneasy; poor peasants and tenant farmers also had emotions of excluding middle peasants. Many villages first held symposiums for middle peasants to let everyone speak their "heartfelt words" and complain about their suffering, resolving the middle peasants' fear of struggle. The poor peasants and tenant farmers were also given the education of "middle and poor peasants are one family, and uniting middle peasants is a great strength," overcoming the idea of ​​excluding middle peasants. Therefore, the broad masses of middle peasants actively participated in the movement and generally shared the fruits of the struggle. In Beima Village, households that obtained the fruits of the struggle accounted for 90% of the entire village, and in Nanfeng Village, it accounted for 83%. In general villages, middle peasants also obtained a lot. The participation of middle peasants greatly enhanced the strength of the peasant struggle, and the liquidation struggle quickly achieved victory. In the past month, the targets of the mass struggle have been the big and evil landlords, and the phenomenon of random struggle in the past has been completely overcome.

　　团结广大中农卷入运动
    襄垣三区全面开展清算
    五十四村初步实现耕者有其田
    【本报长治一日电】襄垣三区于九月中旬总结八月以来的群众运动，认为由于翻身队的帮助与全体区干部的努力，一月来最大的收获是团结了广大中农，转变了混乱局面，使运动不仅走上了正轨，而且普遍到绝大部分村庄。全区一百零三个自然村，除六个自然村外，都开展了清算运动。其中五十四个自然村已经走向深入，初步实现了耕者有其田，农民每人都有了四亩到六亩土地。这一新的运动开始时，中农普遍存在“割韭菜”思想，情绪十分不安；贫佃农也有排斥中农的情绪。许多村子首先召开了中农座谈会，让大家说“心里话”，诉苦，解决了中农的怕斗争思想。对贫佃农也进行了“中贫农是一家，团结中农力量大”的教育，克服了排斥中农的思想。因此，广大中农都积极参加了运动，并普遍分得斗争果实。北马成分得果实户占全村百分之九十，南峰占百分之八十三。一般村庄，中农也都分得不少。中农参加运动，使农民斗争力量大为增强，清算斗争很快获得胜利。一月来，群众斗争的目标都是大恶霸地主，过去乱斗的现象已完全克服。
