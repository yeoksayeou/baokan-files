　　Combining Self-Defense Organization with Livestock Production
    Honglian Village Group Transportation Cooperative Team
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th] The masses in Honglian Village, Qinyuan, closely integrate production with the self-defense war. They have organized all the livestock in the village. One part is retained for use by agricultural mutual aid groups, and the other part, fifty-five head, is formed into a transportation cooperative team. They make round trips to carry goods. Whenever there is a business trip, the transportation team allocates the animals uniformly and provides each animal with two jin of millet per day. This method makes business trips swift and suitable for the demands of the war, and also prevents the support of the war from hindering production.

　　结合自卫组织畜力生产
    红莲村组运输合作队
    【本报阳城十三日电】沁源红莲村群众在自卫战争中紧密结合生产，将全村牲口组织起来，一部留农业互助组使用，另一部五十五头成立运输合作队，往返驮脚，一遇出差即由运输队统拨并供给每头牲口每天小米二斤，这一办法使出差迅速适合战争要求，亦不致因支援战争而妨碍生产。
