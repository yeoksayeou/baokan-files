　　In the eight months of Tunliu's unfolding of a series of liquidation movements, from anti-traitorous accusations and the settling of grievances to the repayment of debts, rent reduction, and interest rate increases, unlawful landlords have been constantly engaging in sabotage behind the scenes. Based on this situation, the leadership, on the one hand, supported the masses and took charge, suppressing the worst elements; on the other hand, it mobilized the masses to deeply engage in anti-traitorous accusations and the settling of grievances, launching a struggle against "counter-attacks." At present, the movement has made significant progress. The details of the process are briefly reported as follows: When the movement began, unlawful landlords and despots everywhere engaged in buying off and deceiving people, secretly convening "peace conferences," inviting farmers who dared to speak their minds to eat "peace meals." After the meals, they immediately proceeded to burn accounts and destroy evidence, and to establish "peace covenants," guaranteeing not to initiate struggles. Villages such as Hebei Nao, Guozhuang, and Chengguan all forcibly established "peace covenants" and burned accounts. Later, they even forced and deceived everyone into burning accounts. In the third district, traitors and unlawful landlords in villages such as Niujia Gou and Yuwu universally and secretly formed "Righteous Harmony Brigades," attempting to disintegrate the struggle, forcing the masses to implement "righteous harmony." Some even put forward threatening slogans: "Whoever initiates struggle will be struggled against." The conspiracies of the traitors and unlawful landlords did not succeed. The farmers countered with the slogan "anti-burning accounts." They said, "Burning the accounts is useless; our bellies are the old accounts, and our mouths are the flowing records." At the same time, anti-buying-off public opinion overwhelmed the landlords' conspiracies. The burning of accounts stopped, and those who burned them regretted it. Within ten days, the anti-traitor movement spread rapidly in 48 villages throughout the county. When landlord-despots found that buying off and deceiving people could not stop the development of the movement, they intensified their efforts, secretly organizing armed forces, attempting to cooperate with the Chiang army's offensive. Despot Yang Mingfang organized an armed force of more than 30 people and stipulated alarm bells and assembly points for alerts. The landlord-despot in Nanxuzhuang even hanged or confiscated the guns of our militia. After studying a series of incidents, the leadership immediately adopted a policy of combining support for the masses with mass suppression. The government issued a proclamation protecting the human rights of farmers and cadres, strictly prohibiting anyone from illegally infringing upon them. The worst traitors and despots were arrested, reactionary armed forces were disbanded, and former puppet cadres who had been hiding in village governments and organizations were removed. In villages such as Laojun Zhuang and Guanzhuang, the worst traitors and despots were arrested on the one hand, and a joint struggle of 13 villages was organized on the other, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the farmers. The settling of grievances and liquidation immediately proceeded smoothly. After Li Huaikui, chairman of the Dongxingwang Farmers' Association, was shot and injured, the county Farmers' Association immediately accepted the farmers' request to file charges. At a grievance-settling conference in seven villages, more than 5,000 people, under the auspices of the government, publicly tried and executed the principal offender, traitor Zhao Xiaowu. Seeing that the government was in charge, the farmers' fighting spirit was greatly enhanced. In the movement, the organization of minor accomplices to confess and combine with the struggle against major despots. In the face of the rapid joint anti-despot power of the masses, general petty traitors were afraid of crime and wavered. Villages such as Changcun organized them to confess and rehabilitate themselves, and then concentrated all their efforts on fighting the major despots, and the movement quickly unfolded. After the struggle to disarm the despots, the movement expanded from 48 villages to 127 villages. Hebei Nao traitor Zhang Zhenmao (former head of the enemy labor bureau) tried to use methods such as inviting cadres to eat "peace meals" and using force, but failed. He then changed his methods, using his henchmen to stage a fake struggle against him, attempting to divert the masses' attention. He also feigned division of property. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately organized the masses and educated his henchmen, turning the fake struggle into a real struggle and overthrowing him. Afterwards, this experience was immediately used to guide the villages, completely defeating the despots who were using the same trick. At present, this movement is still continuing to move forward.

　　政府坚决作主农民联合控诉
    屯留粉碎奸霸“反攻”阴谋
    全力斗争大奸霸运动遍及一百廿余村
    【本报阳城十日电】屯留在开展反奸诉苦复仇到清债减租增资等一连串的清算运动的八个月中，不法地主无时不在暗中破坏。领导上根据此情况，一面给群众撑腰作主，给最坏分子以镇压；一面发动群众深入反奸诉苦，开展反“反攻”斗争，目前运动已获重大进展。兹将经过详情，简略报导如下：当运动开始时，不法地主及奸霸们，曾到处进行收买欺骗，暗地召开“和平会议”，请一般敢据理直言的农民吃“和平饭”，吃完饭，即进行烧账，消灭证据，并订立“和平公约”，保证不起斗争。河北脑、郭庄、城关等村都强迫订了“和平公约”与烧了账。以后更强迫欺骗人人烧账。三区牛家沟余吾等村汉奸、不法地主更普遍秘密成立“义和团”，企图瓦解斗争，强迫群众实行“义和”，有的更提出威胁口号：“谁起斗争，就斗争谁”。汉奸不法地主的阴谋活动，并未得逞，农民曾针锋相对的提出了“反烧账”口号，他们说：“烧了账也不顶事，我们的肚就是老账，嘴就是流水。”同时反收买的舆论，也压倒了地主的阴谋。烧账活动停止了，烧掉的也后悔了。十天内反奸运动就在全县四十八个村猛烈展开。当奸霸地主收买欺骗不能阻止运动的发展时，即变本加厉，秘密组织武装，妄图配合蒋军进攻。恶霸杨明芳即曾组织三十余人的武装，并规定警钟、警报集合地点等。南许庄的奸霸地主，竟有吊打或缴我民兵枪支等情事。领导上研究了一连串发生的情况后，立即采取了撑腰与群众性的镇压相结合的方针。政府出布告保障农民与干部的人权，严禁任何人非法侵犯。逮捕最坏的汉奸、恶霸，解散反动武装，并撤消过去潜藏在村政权团体中的伪干部。在老军庄、官庄等村一面逮捕了最坏的汉奸、恶霸，一面组织了十三个村的联合斗争，大大鼓舞了农民的热情，诉苦清算立即得到顺利开展。当东兴旺农会主席李化奎被黑枪打伤之后，县农会立即接受农民要求提起控诉。在七个村诉苦大会上，五千余人在政府主持下，公审处决了主犯奸特赵小五。农民见政府作主，斗争情绪大为提高。在运动中并组织小的胁从分子坦白与斗争大恶霸相结合。在群众急剧的联合反奸霸威力之前，一般小汉奸都畏罪动摇，常村等村即组织他们坦白自新，然后以全力斗争大奸霸，运动便迅速展开。再经过解除奸霸武装的斗争运动，由四十八个村发展到一百二十七个村。河北瑙奸霸张振毛（曾任敌劳工局长）请干部吃“和平饭”，与武力威胁等办法失败后，便又改变办法，利用爪牙向他进行假斗争，企图转移群众目标。他并假分家产，领导上发现后当即组织群众并教育其爪牙，把假斗争变成了真斗争将他斗倒。事后立即以此经验指导各村，把利用同一伎俩的奸霸完全击败。目前这一运动仍在继续向前发展中。
