　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing: CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan announced on the morning of the 5th that CCP representatives Dong Biwu and Wang himself had separately urged Marshall and Stuart last night to clarify the situation in Zhangjiakou, a question that was not answered in the government's so-called "reply to Zhou Enlai's memorandum." He said: The CCP believes that Zhangjiakou is the most important issue, signifying whether the government wants peace or war. Because the government not only failed to answer this question, but also devoted all its efforts to launching an attack. Wang claimed that the Communist Party had never been formally informed of the simultaneous convening of the Five-Person Committee and the Three-Person Committee, which the government demanded in its statement. When asked about the conditions for the Communist Party's participation in the two committees, Wang said: Stop the attack on Zhangjiakou. When asked what steps would be taken if the government occupied Zhangjiakou, Wang said: If the government does not immediately stop the attack, it will indicate that the government hopes for a complete breakdown, and the government should bear all the responsibility.

　　王炳南同志等促马司
    澄清张垣形势
    【新华社延安七日电】据合众社南京电：中共发言人王炳南五日上午宣称：中共代表董必武及王本人，昨夜曾分别歇两与司徒雷登澄清张家口形势，此为政府所谓“对周恩来备忘录复文”中未答复的问题。他说：中共认为张家口是最重要的问题，意味着政府究竟要和平或战争。因为政府不仅未答复此问题，且投入一切力量从事进攻。王氏声称：共产党从未正式被告以同时召开五人委员会与三人委员会之事，而此乃政府在其声明中所要求者。询以共产党参加两委员会之条件时，王氏称：停止进攻张家口。询以如果政府占领张家口将采什么步骤时，王氏称：如果政府不立即停止进攻，这将表示政府希望全面破裂，全部责任应由政府负之。
