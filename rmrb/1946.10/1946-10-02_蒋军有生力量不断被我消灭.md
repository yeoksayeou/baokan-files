Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. Over the past week, the Eighth Route Army has conducted a large-scale annihilation campaign in southern Shanxi, while continuing to eliminate the living strength of Chiang's army in other areas. In the southern Shanxi campaign, the First Division (now renamed a brigade) of Hu Zongnan's army was annihilated while invading Fushan, and more than 2,500 people, including Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng, were captured. The First Brigade was the most elite unit of Hu Zongnan's army, but it could not withstand a single blow from the Eighth Route Army.

In eastern Hebei, the Eighth Route Army not only repelled the 56th Division of Chiang's army invading Malan, but also widespread guerrilla forces eliminated the invaders company by company. For example, the Fengrun guerrillas attacked a major stronghold west of Tangshan, annihilating more than 400 Chiang's puppet troops. In Rehe, the Eighth Route Army recovered Ningcheng on the 25th, eliminating more than 1,600 of Chiang’s soldiers. Powerful local armed forces of the Rehe people are operating on both sides of the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway. The situation in eastern Hebei and Rehe shows that Chiang's army only occupies a few points and lines, while the Eighth Route Army controls a vast area. The strength of the Eighth Route Army has not only not weakened, but is increasing daily, and it never misses an opportunity to eliminate the strength of the invaders.

Guerrilla warfare in various places is becoming increasingly fierce. For example, the militia in Linzhang, southern Hebei, once annihilated more than 300 invading puppet troops; the militia in Anyang, northern Henan, fought 20 battles in five days, killing and wounding more than 200 Chiang's puppet troops. The militia in southern Shanxi recovered the important ferry crossing of Maojindu, as well as the towns in the southeast of Linfen County, the county seat and the eastern half of Pu County. The militia in Haimen, central Jiangsu, killed more than ten people, including the notorious bandit Xu Baoying, the current Chiang’s appointed chief of the First District of Haimen; thousands of militia in Pei County are besieging Pei County; the militia in central Hebei attacked Yudaizhen, north of the Yongding River, and took advantage of the victory to liberate Gongyizhuang and kill or wound 83 of Chiang's soldiers; the local armed forces in Daxing have eliminated more than 140 of Chiang's soldiers, including battalion commanders, in the past four days.

Chiang's army in the Hebei-Suiyuan-Shanxi area is currently advancing on Zhangjiakou in several directions. The 170,000 citizens of the city and the soldiers and civilians of the entire Chahar Province have completed preparations for self-defense and counterattack. Experienced observers believe that Chiang Kai-shek not only did not withdraw the five unreasonable demands, but instead invaded Zhangjiakou, which is beyond the five unreasonable demands. The consequences of this arrogant action will be extremely painful for Chiang Kai-shek. The soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas will continue to fight until the offensive of Chiang's army is completely crushed.

### 蒋军有生力量不断被我消灭

　　蒋军有生力量不断被我消灭
    【新华社延安二十九日电】过去一周中八路军在晋南进行一个大规模的歼灭战役，而在其他地区继续不断地消灭蒋军有生力量。在晋南战役中，胡宗南部第一师（现改称旅）在进犯浮山时被歼灭，旅长黄正成等二千五百余人就擒。第一旅乃胡宗南部最精锐的部队，但是经不起八路军一击。
    在冀东八路军不仅击退进犯马兰之蒋军五十六师，而且广大的游击队到处把进犯者一营一连地消灭。如丰润游击队袭击唐山以西大据点，歼灭蒋伪军四百余名。热河方面八路军于二十五日收复宁城，消灭蒋军一千六百余人。强大的热河人民地方武装正活动于锦承路两侧。冀东和热河形势，显示蒋军仅占若干点线，而八路军则控制广大的面。八路军的力量不仅没有削弱，而且天天增强，并从来不放过消灭进犯者力量的机会。
    各地游击战争益趋猛烈。例如冀南临漳民兵曾一次歼灭进犯伪军三百余人，豫北安阳民兵五天内作战二十次，毙伤蒋伪军二百余。晋南民兵收复重要渡口茅津渡，临汾东南之县底镇及蒲县东半部各城镇。苏中海门民兵击毙巨匪现任蒋方海门第一区区长徐宝营等十余人；沛县数千民兵正围困沛县城；冀中民兵进攻永定河北榆岱镇，乘胜解放公义庄及毙伤蒋军八十三名；大兴地方武装四日来消灭蒋军营长以下一百四十余人。
    冀绥晋一带蒋军现正分路进犯张家口，该市十七万市民及全察哈尔省军民已完成自卫反击准备。有经验的观察家认为蒋介石不仅不撤销五项无理要求，反而进犯五项无理要求之外的张家口，此种狂妄行动，其后果对于蒋介石将是异常痛苦的。解放区军民将战斗下去，一直到彻底粉碎蒋军的进攻为止。
