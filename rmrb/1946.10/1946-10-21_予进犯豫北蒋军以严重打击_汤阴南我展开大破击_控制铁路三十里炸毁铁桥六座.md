　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Changzhi, dated the 19th] Chiang's puppet troops have launched a large-scale invasion of our Northern Henan Liberated Area. On the night of the 16th, our military and civilians in Northern Henan proactively launched a large-scale sabotage campaign against the Pinghan Railway, 30 li south of Tangyin city. All twenty-odd stubborn puppet strongholds between Tangyin and Yigou Town (on the border of Tangyin and Qixian counties), except for Huangxiakou Village, were captured. All bunkers were razed to the ground by our forces. The Chiang army's 318th Regiment of the 40th Division and Hu Quanlu's puppet Tangyin Security Regiment, stationed there, were intimidated by our military might and fled into Tangyin city. On the 17th, Chiang's puppet troops from Tangyin and Yigou attempted to provide reinforcements three times, but were repelled by our forces. In this battle, dozens of Chiang's puppet troops were killed or wounded, over a hundred were captured, and we seized three machine guns, over a hundred rifles, over three thousand hand grenades, thousands of rounds of ammunition, twelve warhorses, eight telephones, and recovered over two thousand catties of telephone wire. Six railway bridges were destroyed (one of which was the second largest railway bridge between Xinxiang and Anyang). Thirty li of railway is now completely under our control.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng, dated the 19th] The Chiang army's 164th Regiment of the 55th Brigade and the puppet troops of Zhang Bohua, Wei Ansheng, and others, entrenched in Potou and Yewu areas of Northern Henan, cooperated with the Chiang army invading Jiaozuo on the 12th and launched an attack on our Jiyuan and Mengxian areas. That night, they occupied our Shizhuang, Nanshe, Shunjian, and other places. After being resisted by our forces, they held their ground awaiting reinforcements. On the 13th, the 103rd Regiment of the Chiang army, crossing from the north of the Yellow River, reinforced them and attacked our Tangwang Temple and Lucun (25 li west of Mengxian) again. On the 14th, they advanced in multiple directions, one route capturing Mengxian city and the other occupying Longtai (30 li northwest of Mengxian), attempting to coordinate with the Chiang army occupying Bo'ai and Qinyang to advance on our Jiyuan and open the Ji (yuan) Yuan (qu) highway. Our forces are currently still confronting Chiang's puppet troops in the suburbs of Mengxian city.
