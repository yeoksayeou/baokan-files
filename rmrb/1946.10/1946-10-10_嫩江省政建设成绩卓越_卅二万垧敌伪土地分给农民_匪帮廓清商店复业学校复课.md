Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 7th: At the first meeting of county and banner leaders in the province last month, Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, summarized the province's democratic construction work over the past ten months, stating: According to incomplete statistics, the total area of enemy, puppet, and exploiter land distributed throughout the province up to September 15th reached 319,549 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu). Many poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants, and middle peasants have risen to become rich peasants, eagerly purchasing livestock and spontaneously organizing mutual aid teams. Military and government organs have allocated horses confiscated from bandit suppression to farmers, and the government has also issued loans to support agricultural production. People in various regions have actively organized self-defense forces and militia to suppress bandits and maintain public order. The external bandit forces have now been eliminated, including the notorious Shang Qiyue and Song Tongshan gangs. Commerce is gradually recovering. In Qiqihar City, the number of businesses increased from 985 in June of this year to 1,542. The provincial government has also allocated 100,000 yuan to establish the Nenjiang Industrial Company, whose task is to unite the business community, regulate and stabilize prices, and stabilize finance. Among the province's fifteen counties, banners, and cities, there are a total of 639 primary schools, 12 middle schools, with 55,112 primary school students and 4,829 middle school students. The ideological issues of teachers in various schools have been resolved, and they are beginning to integrate teaching with practice. Literacy classes and blackboard newspapers have begun to be established in various regions. In addition to the "New Nenjiang Daily," local newspapers and various publications have been published in various regions. In terms of Mongolian political work, with the aim of assisting Mongolian ethnic autonomy, the province has established a Mongolian Political Affairs Office and is carrying out the following tasks: (1) Assisting the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Association in carrying out mass work in various regions. A joint Mongolian-Han county government has been established in Longjiang County, with a Mongolian serving as deputy county head. (2) Establishing seven Mongolian Normal Schools. (3) Preparing for the establishment of Mongolian People's Cooperatives. (4) Establishing the Dorbod Banner, with a Mongolian as the banner head. In addition, there are the Yiran Ming'an Banner and the Bu Banner within the province, both of which have Mongolians as banner heads. Joint Mongolian-Han councils have been established in the aforementioned regions. Chairman Yu finally put forward three central tasks for the future: (1) Mobilize the masses to continue to implement land reform and transform political power. (2) Develop industry and commerce, prosper the economy, achieve self-sufficiency, reduce the burden on the people, and improve people's lives. (3) Mobilize all forces to support the self-defense front and ensure self-defense supplies.
