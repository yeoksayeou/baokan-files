(Our Dispatch from Changzhi, 12th) With the help of land reform work teams, farmers in Xingtai, Shahe, Lincheng, Zanhuang, Neiqiu, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, Jingxing, and Huolu counties in the First District of Taihang have entered another high tide of land reform since August. Of the more than 1,000 administrative villages in the district, over 800 have launched vigorous movements. The number of people involved in the movement has reached 400,000, double the number before July. The movement has not only become widespread in the core areas but has also developed into the peripheral areas of Gaoyi and Yuanshi. In terms of the depth of the movement, 10% of the villages in the district have initially realized "land to the tiller," with farmers gaining four to six mu of land each, completely eliminating extreme poverty.

At the beginning of the movement, each county, in accordance with the spirit of the district party committee's "meeting the land demands of farmers," reviewed the movement before August, broke down the complacency of county and district cadres, and gained a clearer understanding of boldly unleashing the masses and following the mass line. As a result, this movement has shown many new characteristics:

1.  Vigorous struggles have replaced the slow, tentative approach of the past, which involved "moving from individuals to small groups and then to large meetings."

2.  Mobilizing the broad masses to speak out and struggle has replaced the cadre-dominated approach of simply calculating accounts and then distributing land to the masses.

3.  The clear slogan of "uniting middle and poor peasants to target a small number of major despots" has replaced the vague slogan of the past, which said, "Do whatever the masses want, no matter how it's done." Middle peasants have not only not been targeted in the struggle but have also shared in the fruits of the struggle.

In Shahe's Putongdian, one major struggle toppled the ruling clique of ten large landlords, and the masses said, "This time it was so decisive! If we had been so polite as in the past, we wouldn't have been able to topple them in a year!" Because the broad masses of middle peasants were united in the movement, the strength of the masses greatly increased. Statistics from 35 villages in Shahe show that the number of members in the peasant associations before July was only 2,926, but now it has grown to 5,038, an increase of 70%, with middle peasants accounting for half of the new members. The distribution of fruits is also very common. In Nanyu Village, Zanhuang, 100 out of 109 households received fruits. In the Fourth District of Gaoyi, 70% of the households received fruits. In Xizhuang, Shahe, the figure reached 83%. The "cutting chives" mentality of the middle peasants in the past has been largely eliminated, and they have become a powerful part of this movement. As of the end of September, the movement in various places was still progressing vigorously. Currently, the leadership is concentrating its efforts on making breakthroughs in nearly 200 backward villages in order to quickly bring the movement into balance.

　　冀西坚决满足农民土地要求
    八百余村掀起猛烈运动
    十分之一村庄实现耕者有其田二百个落后村正集中力量突击
    【本报长治十二日电】太行一分区邢台、沙河、临城、赞皇、内邱、高邑、元氏、井陉、获鹿等县农民，在翻身队帮助下，从八月份起，再度进入翻身高潮。全区千余行政村中，掀起猛烈运动的已有八百多个。卷入运动的群众达四十万人，较七月前增加一倍。运动不仅普遍到腹心地区，且已发展到边沿地区的高邑、元氏。从运动的深度看，全区百分之十的村庄，已初步实现了耕者有其田，农民均获得土地四亩到六亩，彻底消灭了赤贫。运动开始时，各县都根据区党委“满足农民土地要求”的精神，对八月份前的运动作了检查，打破了县区干部的自满情绪，对大胆放手、走群众路线，也有了明确的认识。因之这次运动中表现了许多新的特点：一、以迅雷般的大斗争代替了过去“由个别到小组、再到大会”的慢腾腾的小手小脚做法。二、以发动广大群众起来诉苦斗争，代替了单纯算账，算出后分给群众的干部包办代替作风。三、以“中农贫农大团结对准少数大恶霸”的明确口号代替了过去“群众要甚就干甚，不管怎样干起来都行”的笼统的口号。中农不仅未被斗争，且同样分得斗争果实。沙河的普通店，一次大斗争就把十户大地主的统治集团斗垮了，群众说：“这一次多干脆！像过去那样斯斯文文，一年也斗不垮！”运动中由于团结了广大中农，群众力量大为增长。沙河三十五村统计，农会在七月前只有二千九百二十六人，现在发展到有五千零三十八人，增加了百分之七十，其中中农占一半。果实分配也极普遍，赞皇南峪村一百零九户，有一百户分得果实。高邑四区分果实户是百分之七十。沙河西庄达百分之八十三。过去中农的“割韭菜”思想已普遍解除，并成为这次运动中的有力部分。截至九月底，各地运动仍在猛烈进展中。目前尚有将近二百个落后村，领导上正集中力量进行突击，以求运动迅速走向平衡。
