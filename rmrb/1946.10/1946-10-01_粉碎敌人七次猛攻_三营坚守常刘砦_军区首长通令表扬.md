　　Smashed Seven Enemy Assaults
    Third Battalion Firmly Defended Changliuzhai
    Military Region Leaders Issued Commendation
    [Report from the JiluYu Frontline Reporter Group, October 27th] The leaders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently issued a commendation for the Third Battalion of the × Regiment for their firm defense of Changliuzhai.
    Changliuzhai is located seven miles southwest of Hanji in Caoxian County, and is the junction of the invading Third Division and the 47th Division of the Sichuan Army. The Third Battalion accepted the task of occupying the village and cutting off the enemy's connection. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, the troops worked all night to build fortifications. Political Instructor Zhang Manhe of the Seventh Company proposed that "fortifications are life." The Ninth Company was a newly formed company, and the artillery squad leader proposed, "We must make a name for ourselves in this battle and learn from the old大哥 Seventh Company." The soldiers were in high spirits.
    On the morning of the 4th, more than a thousand enemies occupied Weizhuang and Laojunzhu to the south of Changliuzhai. The main force of the enemy was attacking from Changluji in the west and Liuzhai on the side, putting our troops in a position of being attacked from all sides. The only passage in the northeast corner was also blocked by enemy machine guns. At noon, the enemy concentrated all its firepower and launched three fierce attacks. More than 300 shells landed in the village, leaving almost no complete houses. Deputy Battalion Commander Dong Shouchang gathered the branch secretaries to mobilize them. He said calmly, "Communists must show their true colors at this time. If the enemy is tenacious, we must be even more tenacious than the enemy." The branch secretaries of each company told this to every party member in the fortifications, and everyone unanimously replied, "We must persevere to the last person."
    Liu Baomin, a soldier of the Second Platoon of the Seventh Company, who had just been liberated in the Mengxian battle this spring, had his fortification destroyed by an enemy shell, burying him in the soil. After other comrades dug him out, he didn't care and started digging new fortifications to defend the position.
    The machine gun squad's fortifications were also destroyed by artillery fire. Squad Leader Fan Wenshan was wounded, but he insisted on staying on the front line and continued to lead the squad to rebuild the fortifications.
    The soldiers automatically proposed the slogan: "Artillery fire cannot solve the battle, pay attention to the enemy on the ground." Comrade Luan Yunsheng was manning a heavy machine gun facing the south end of the village. He single-handedly swept back an enemy attack. We saw nine enemy corpses being carried away. The Ninth Company truly "learned from the Seventh Company." Under several fierce attacks by the enemy, they still defended the south gate without taking a step back, and killed or wounded more than forty enemies. Shi Luhe, the deputy squad leader of the engineering squad, and soldier Wang Yulin, used two guns to block a 50-meter-wide area, knocking down seven enemies, preventing them from approaching the Eighth Company. Guo Xiangde, the "country bumpkin" deputy platoon leader of a certain company guarding the southeast of the village, shot down three enemies with five bullets. They nine held off a company of Chiang's troops. They proposed, "Don't shoot until they are within a hundred meters."
    In this battle, the enemy's seven fierce attacks were repelled. Changliuzhai remained unmoved. The next day, the counterattack on Fengcun and its capture more effectively cooperated with the main battle to eliminate the Third Division in the north. In this battle, the Third Battalion suffered only 23 casualties. Deputy Battalion Commander Dong Shouchang gloriously sacrificed himself during the attack on Fengcun.
    Since this battle, the heroic defense of Changliuzhai by the Third Battalion has been the talk of the entire army on the front line. (Wu Xiang)

### 粉碎敌人七次猛攻  三营坚守常刘砦  军区首长通令表扬

　　粉碎敌人七次猛攻
    三营坚守常刘砦
    军区首长通令表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二十七日电】晋冀鲁豫军区首长顷通令表扬坚守常刘岩之×团第三营。
    常刘砦位于曹县韩集西南七里，为此次进犯之第三师与川军四十七师的接合点。第三营接受任务占领该村，切断敌人连系。本月三日晚间，部队修了一整夜的工事，七连政指张满喝同志提出“工事是生命”。九连是个新成立的连，炮兵班长提出“要在这次战斗中打出个牌子来，向七连老大哥看齐”。战士们情绪很高。
    四日清晨，一千多敌人，攻占常刘岩南的魏庄、老君主，敌人主力则从西面之常路集，及侧面之刘砦，陷于一面受敌，东北角唯一的通路也被敌人机枪封锁住了。中午敌人集中所有的火器发动三次猛攻，村内落了三百多发炮弹，几乎没有剩下一间完整房子。副营长董寿昌同志，召集支部书记进行动员他非常沉住气地说：“共产党员要在这时候表现出自己的特色，敌人顽强，我们要比敌人更顽强。”各连支部书记把这话在工事里一个传一个的告诉了每个党员，大家一致回答：“我们一定要坚持到最后一个人。”
    七连二班战士刘保民，今春孟县战斗中才解放过来的，被敌人一个炮弹轰倒了工事，将他埋在土里。别的同志把他挖出来后，他毫不在乎的又挖起新的工事，坚持阵地。
    机枪班的工事也被炮摧垮了，班长范文山挂了彩，他坚持不下火线，仍然领导全班重修工事。
    战士们自动提出口号：“炮火不能解决战斗，要注意地面上的敌人”。村正南端架着栾云生同志打的一挺重机枪，他独自扫回了敌人的一次进攻，敌人背回的死尸，被我们看见的就有九具。九连真正做到了“向七连看齐”。在敌人几次猛攻下，他们仍然坚守南门，没有后退一步，并且杀伤了四十多个敌人。工兵班副班长史戮河与战士王玉林，两支枪封锁了五十米宽的地面，打倒七个敌人，使他们不敢接近八连。守村东南某连的“土包子”副排长郭相德同志，五发子弹打倒三个敌人。他们九个人顶住了蒋军一个连，他们提出“不到一百米不打枪”。
    在这次战斗中，敌人前后七次的猛攻都被打退了。常刘砦屹然不动。第二天反击冯村并攻占它，更有力的配合了北面消灭第三师的主要战斗。这次第三营伤亡仅二十三人，副营长董寿昌同志在攻占冯村时，光荣牺牲。
    从这次战斗后，在前线整个部队中，谈论着第三营坚守常刘砦的模范战斗事迹。（吴象）
