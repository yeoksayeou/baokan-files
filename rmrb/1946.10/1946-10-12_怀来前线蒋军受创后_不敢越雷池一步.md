Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 8th: Chiang's 53rd Army, 130th Division, has been deployed to the East Ping-Sui Front to make up for the heavy losses of the 16th Army. On the 7th and 8th, the division launched successive attacks with three regiments against the Eighth Route Army positions at Baiyanquan and Nanxinbao, south of Yanqing, but were repelled, with Chiang's troops suffering over a hundred casualties. After suffering devastating blows on the Huailai front of the East Ping-Sui sector, Chiang's troops have not dared to step over the line in recent days. From 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 4th, the Chiang side dispatched five U.S.-made bombers to bomb Huailai City in rotation, resulting in more than 20 civilian casualties. The city defense troops and the picket team bravely extinguished the flames and rescued the injured civilians. Furthermore, on the 29th of last month, when Chiang's planes bombed Xuanhua, one was shot down by the Eighth Route Army city defense troops and crashed into a wheat field in Yuxian County.

　　怀来前线蒋军受创后
    不敢越雷池一步
    【新华社平绥东线八日电】蒋军五十三军一三○师已投入平绥东线，填补十六军的重大损失。七八两日该师连续以三个团兵力向延庆南之白眼泉、南新堡等八路军阵地进攻，均被击退，蒋军伤亡百余人。平绥东段怀来前线蒋军遭受歼灭性打击后，近日不敢越雷池一步。四日上午八时至下午四时，蒋方出动美制轰炸机五架。轮番轰炸怀来城，商民死伤二十余人。城防部队及纠察队奋勇扑灭火焰，救护伤民。又上月二十九日蒋机轰炸宣化时，有一架为八路军城防部队击落，降落于蔚县麦田里。
