　　【Benbao Weixian, 26th Dispatch】In order to allow soldiers at the front to fight with peace of mind and kill more enemies, the masses of Gucheng are actively strengthening the work of giving preferential treatment to military families. In villages with many military families, labor is transferred from other villages to help with farming. For example, Nanluzhuang, Sanlang and other villages have 21 military families, and the surrounding villages send 94 workers on a long-term basis to assist them. Currently, 40 villages in the entire area have organized long-term farming assistance groups, with 1,598 group members. Twenty-four villages have organized water carrying teams, with 122 team members. At present, in addition to completing the autumn harvest on behalf of military families, 3,500 mu of wheat has been planted, with the military families' wheat planting accounting for 50% of all land. 7,069 mu of autumn land has been farmed on behalf of military families, and preferential grain has been distributed to poor military families. Ninety households have received preferential treatment, with more than 4,000 jin of grain distributed. Special preferential treatment is given to 49 military families (those who have been emancipated, distributed land, and have not harvested grain), with more than 1,000 jin of grain distributed. The military families all said: "Joining the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek is voluntary. The government gives preferential treatment, and the old and young men take care of us. We really feel bad about it!"

    故城处处厚待军属
    【本报威县二十六日电】故城群众为使前方战士安心作战，多杀敌人，积极加强优待军属工作。军属多的村，由外村调剂劳力代耕，如南鲁庄、三郎等村有二十一户军属，周围村即长期出工九十四个协助他们。现全区已组织起长期代耕组的有四十个村，组员一千五百九十八人。组织起担水队的二十四村，队员一百二十二人。目前除完成代军属秋收外，并已种麦三千五百亩，抗属种麦均占所有土地的百分之五十。代耕秋地七千零六十九亩，给贫苦军属发优待粮，受优待者九十户，发粮四千余斤，特殊优待者（翻了身、分了地、没打粮食的军属）四十九户，发粮千余斤。军属们都说：“参军打老蒋是自愿的，政府给优待，老少爷们又照顾，真叫俺过意不去！”
