Farmers in the Second District of Yushe Actively Donate Money
　　To Purchase Self-Defense Weapons for the Militia
　　Liberated Farmers in Anyang Compete to Hand Over Public Grain

　　[Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 21st Dispatch] Upon hearing that the bandit Chiang had occupied our Jiaozuo, the liberated farmers in the Second District of Yushe were extremely indignant and donated money one after another to purchase military fire weapons for the militia, preparing to rush to the battlefield at any time. At present, the donations from each village have reached more than 800,000 yuan. Yangtian Village purchased five additional rifles, one machine gun, and a number of bullets. Zhaowang Village purchased four additional rifles, one small cannon, and a batch of bullets. Houguo Village also added seventeen rifles. Old Mrs. Yang, a newly promoted middle peasant in Xiyadi Village, voluntarily donated ten ewes for the militia to buy guns. Another middle peasant, Yang Weizhong, said, "It is impossible to defend ourselves with only people but no guns. I am willing to donate 400 silver dollars for the militia to buy weapons to eliminate the reactionaries!" Yang Zhongze continued, "I will give the militia twenty grenades to hit the enemy. Whoever wants to bully us will be killed! We are not afraid of Chiang Kai-shek or the American old devils!" The masses in the whole village immediately responded to the exemplary actions of the two of them, donating 26 mu of land, 44 sheep, and 4,000 silver dollars. At present, the militiamen in each village are actively practicing martial arts, preparing to go to the battlefield with guns at any time.

　　[Our Newspaper, Anyang News] The liberated farmers in Anyang are actively handing over public grain with high patriotic enthusiasm. The Third, Sixth, and Seventh Districts have all completed the grain requisition task five days ahead of schedule. Cheng Heshang, a farmer in Xiluxian, voluntarily handed over 75 jin extra. He said, "In the past, I was exploited by others and only had three mu of land left. Now the Eighth Route Army has helped me fight back for twelve mu of land. If I contribute more public grain so that our army can eat their fill and defeat Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries, our lives will be even better!" A mutual aid team in Shangcai Village was assigned 1,500 jin of grain, but the whole team was willing to contribute more, and as a result, they handed over a total of 2,000 jin. A demobilized soldier in Dongaikou, who was a hero in killing the enemy in the past and is now disabled, voluntarily handed over public grain even though he should not have been burdened with it. In general, the families of those resisting the enemy, because they have received special care from the government and the masses in the mass movement and land reform, have greatly improved their awareness and have voluntarily handed over more public grain.
