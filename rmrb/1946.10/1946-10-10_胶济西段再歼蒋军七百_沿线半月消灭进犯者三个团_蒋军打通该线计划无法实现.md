Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Front, 7th. Following the annihilation of three companies of the Provisional 15th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 96th Army on September 30th, the western section of the Jiaoji Railway saw the annihilation of another 700+ Chiang Kai-shek troops on the 1st and 2nd of this month. On the evening of September 30th, thirteen regiments from Chiang Kai-shek's 73rd Army, 193rd Division, 12th Army, 111st Division, and 96th Army, Provisional 4th Division, scurried southward from the line between Mingshui Station in the west and Longshan Station. On October 1st, they were routed by the Eighth Route Army in Baiquan Town, ten li south of Mingshui Station, Wushanzi, ten li south of Zaoyuan Station, and Beiyuzhuang, ten li southeast of Longshan Station, suffering over 400 casualties. The Eighth Route Army and the militia tracked and pursued them, pressing close to the railway. On the 2nd, Chiang's troops again launched an attack under the cover of aircraft and artillery, engaging in fierce battles all day in Wushanzi, Chengcun, and Fenxiling. After killing over 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops, the Eighth Route Army proactively withdrew to the outer lines at dusk to wait for an opportunity to annihilate more of Chiang's forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 7th. In the past half month, fierce battles have occurred in many places along the Jiaoji Railway. Chiang Kai-shek's plan to open the Jiaoji Railway has failed. In the eastern section, the 198th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Army scurried northwest from Jiju on September 24th and was annihilated by the Jiaodong Eighth Route Army in the Taishazhuang area. The bodies of over 600 Chiang Kai-shek troops were left behind. On the 3rd of this month, the Yan Zifeng unit of Chiang Kai-shek's Provisional 12th Division (reorganized from the remnants of the puppet Zhao Baoyuan) again launched an attack from Jimo. Its First Regiment was annihilated by the Eighth Route Army in Lingshan on the 4th, and its Second Regiment was also routed. In the central section, the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's 8th Army, after occupying Guangrao on September 10th, launched a northward attack on the area south of the Xiaoqing River from Zhangdian and Yidu on the 24th, along with the Independent 10th Division and nine other regiments. The Bohai local forces of the Eighth Route Army took advantage of the situation to directly attack Chiang's strongholds in Zouping and Zhangqiu in the north, annihilating one battalion and two companies of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, forcing Chiang's troops to withdraw to reinforce the rear. On the 30th, a portion of this army and over 3,000 puppet troops of Qin San's unit scurried northeast from the county towards Changyi, where they were blocked by the Fifth Military Sub-district in Hanting, suffering over 60 casualties. After inflicting heavy casualties on Chiang's troops, the Changyi garrison transferred to the suburbs of the city on the 1st to resist. In the western section, the Luzhong Eighth Route Army, in coordination with the Bohai military and civilians' self-defense counterattack, successively captured Wujiazhuang, 30 li south of Jinan, on September 29th and 30th, destroyed five blockhouses west of Longshan Station on the Jiaoji Railway, and recovered three strongholds including Fenxiling, 20 li south of Mingshui Station, annihilating three companies of the Provisional 15th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 96th Army, and is now expanding the gains. According to incomplete statistics, three regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops have been annihilated in the past half month, over 400 captured alive, and over four artillery pieces, over thirty machine guns, and over 360 rifles seized.
