Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Chongqing dispatch: The Chongqing People's Promotion of Peace Association held a symposium on the 27th of last month in response to the American "Get Out of China Week". More than 200 celebrities from all walks of life attended. The meeting decided: (1) To promote the organization of the World Peace Promotion Association. (2) To boycott the US military until it withdraws from China. (3) To request the British government to stand up and adhere to the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Communique and investigate the extent of US implementation. (4) To submit to the Security Council and the Far East Commission that the Chinese representative's defense in the Security Council of the US military's interference in China's internal affairs violates the will of the Chinese people. (5) To write to Marshall. (6) To expand the "US Military Get Out of China Week" movement. During the symposium, Guo Zeshen said: The current US policy is the most reactionary policy in the world. This policy is caused by the combination of US warlords wanting to monopolize capital. Truman and Byrnes have changed the world from democratic to undemocratic. They are more harmful and more reactionary than Hitler. Wu Dingyi called on mobilizing all the people's strength to carry out a resilient and long-term struggle against imperialism. Deng Chumin pointed out that it is not enough to just shout "The US get out of China" today. Today, everything is in the hands of the "foreign daddy," including territorial waters, airspace, inland rivers, politics, and economy. We demand that the US rule get out of China. Zeng Shufan said: "We stand on the people's position to demand peace. To have peace, the US military must withdraw from China."
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai dispatch: On the fourth day of the US military's Get Out of China movement (26th), the Shanghai cultural and educational circles held a symposium. Guo Moruo, Zhou Jianren, and representatives of various groups, more than 30 people, attended. They unanimously believed that the US military's presence in China is to turn China into a second Philippines. They demanded that the United States respect and maintain friendship, immediately withdraw the US military stationed in China, and restore Roosevelt's policies. Ye Shengtao pointed out that the Kuomintang government's request for the US military to be stationed in China has turned the Three Principles of the People into "no people's principles." Jian Bozan said: The Kuomintang authorities' behavior has become a traitor to the Three Principles of the People and an unworthy descendant of Sun Yat-sen. The Chinese people will never be slaves and will not support those who sacrifice national independence in exchange for their own regime. He also pointed out that American imperialism is smarter, more inhumane, and more shameless than German fascism, that is, it helps China's civil war with arms while carrying out various deceptions. For example, saying that the US military is stationed in China to protect American overseas Chinese, then can China also send troops to New York and Washington to protect Chinese overseas Chinese? We want to tell the United States that the Chinese people are against the US military being stationed in China. Ma Xulun believes that this movement should penetrate the broad masses of the people and oppose the collusion of Chinese and American reactionaries. Mao Dun exposed the truth of the US policy toward China, which is to turn China into a second Philippines. Pan Jinong said: We should not underestimate the petty bourgeoisie. From their actual lives, they are already saying: "The blue-eyed devils are no better than the Eastern devils." Chen Baichen expressed his indignation at the drowning of an eleven-year-old girl by the US military in Tianjin, believing it to be the most brutal. Wu Renzhi suggested that people should consider not using American goods. Guo Moruo pointed out: The "US Military Get Out of China" movement should not only make the US military withdraw from China, but also promote the US government to restore Roosevelt's policies, so the time cannot be limited to one week. This is a considerably long-term job that does not tire of repetition. Guo called on the Chinese people to make efforts to save the crisis with the spirit of national salvation nine years ago. The symposium decided to send a memorandum to the US government and the Security Council, in addition to appealing to the American people and the cultural and educational circles.

    【新华社延安三日电】沪讯：美军退出中国运动第四日（二十六日），沪市文化组教育界举行座谈会，到郭沫若、周建人等及各团体代表三十余人，一致认为美军驻华是图沦中国为菲律宾第二，要求美国尊重保持友谊，立即撤退驻华美军，恢复罗斯福政策。叶圣陶指出：国民党政府请求美军驻华，已使三民主义变为“无民主义”。翦伯赞称：国民党当局此种行为，已成三民主义之叛徒，孙中山的不肖子孙。中国人民决不愿做奴隶，对那些牺牲国家民族独立以换取自己的政权的行为必不赞助。并指出：美国帝国主义比德国法西斯更聪明，也更无人格，更无耻者，即一面以军火帮助中国内战，一面又进行种种欺骗。如说美军驻华为保护美侨，则中国可否也派出军队去纽约、华盛顿保护华侨？我们要告诉美国，中国人民都反对美军驻华。马叙伦认为这一运动应深入广大人民群众中去，反对中美反动派同合流。茅盾揭露美国对华政策的真相乃欲沦中国为菲律宾第二。潘孑农说：不应低估小市民，从实际生活中他们已在说：“蓝眼鬼子不比东洋鬼子好”了。陈白尘对天津美军溺毙十一岁女孩表示愤激，认为是最残暴者。吴仞之提出人民应考虑不用美货问题。郭沫若指出：“美军退出中国”运动，不仅要美军退出中国，并且要促美政府恢复罗斯福政策，故时间不能限于一周，这是一件不厌重复的相当长期的工作。郭氏呼吁中国人民应以九年前的救亡精神，努力挽救危机。座谈会决定除向美国人民及文化教育界呼吁外，并向美政府及安理会提出备忘录。
