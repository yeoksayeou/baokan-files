　　New Comrade Zhang Peizhen
　　——Frontline Dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
　　Day was about to break. Zhang Peizhen poked his head out from the moat. He could vaguely see the enemy's machine guns firing wildly from the city wall. Zhang Peizhen said, "I can't just stay here and get shot to death by the enemy's machine guns. I have to hurry back and find the unit, otherwise, things will be bad when it gets light." So, he crawled out of the water, his rifle still slung over his shoulder, but his legs felt somewhat disobedient. Probably the enemy heard some noise, and the machine guns roared wildly again. "Damn it, this is so annoying! I must not be discovered by the enemy. I have to go back and find the unit, and then come back to fight these people who are invading the people..." He crawled along, thinking, and vaguely saw his own unit ahead. He went over and asked, "Comrade, where is the 11th Company?" "It's in the back," so he crawled over there.
　　Who would have thought that during the city assault, Zhang Peizhen and two others would be assigned to carry the ladder? Although he was a new comrade who had only been liberated for a few days, he fought as bravely as a veteran soldier of many years. After accepting the task, he thought, "Why do you need three people to carry a ladder? I can do it myself." So, he shouldered a ladder and ran over. Just then, the enemy's machine guns swept over, and Zhang Peizhen was trapped in the moat. He kept his head above the water, grabbing a small tree while the bullets flew overhead. The unit discovered that Zhang Peizhen was missing, and everyone guessed wildly: "Maybe he was hit by a bullet, wounded, sacrificed, or..." We can only think of a way to find him at night. But Comrade Zhang Peizhen came back himself.
　　The company commander was the first to jump up and welcome him, and then everyone gathered around, asking questions and expressing their joy. Zhang Peizhen's clothes were soaked through, so someone brought him their own dry clothes to change into; Zhang Peizhen's legs were swollen from being soaked in the water, and someone actually brought him five pairs of pants to put on. "No, you must wear thick clothes so you sweat. Once you sweat, your legs will get better." Zhang Peizhen drank the hot soup that someone handed him, and then went to sleep and sweated, and his legs quickly went down.
　　He was a machine gunner from the 221st Regiment of the 74th Brigade of the 55th Division of the Kuomintang. He was from Zhengyang, Henan. He had been conscripted into the Kuomintang army for five or six years. He was once captured by the Eighth Route Army last spring. After the ceasefire order, the Eighth Route Army released him. Recently, he was captured again. After arriving in the Eighth Route Army, he told people, "This time I will never go back. Even if you tell me to go, I won't go. I won't go no matter how much money you give me. The Eighth Route Army is really the people's army. It is really glorious to sacrifice and shed blood in the Eighth Route Army."

　　新同志张培珍
    ——冀鲁豫前线通讯
    天快亮了，张培珍在城壕里探出头来，可以隐约看到敌人的机枪疯狂的从城墙上扫射出来的时候，张培珍说：“我不能老呆在这里给敌人的机枪射死，得赶快跑回去找队伍，不然天一亮就糟糕了。”于是他就从水里爬出来，步枪仍旧挂在自己的肩上，腿却像有些不听话似的。大概是敌人听到有声音吧，机枪又在疯狂的吼叫，“妈的真讨厌！我怎么也不能给敌人发现了，我得回去找队伍，再来打这班侵犯人民的东西……”他一面爬行一面想着，隐约的看见前面有自己的队伍，他走过去问：“同志，十一连在什么地方？”“就在后面”，他就爬过去了。
    谁会想到在攻城的时候，张培珍等三个人竟担任抬梯子，虽是刚解放几天的新同志，但他作战的勇敢，和多年的老战士一样。”接受任务后，他想：“抬梯子何必三个人？我一个人就办了。”他就扛起一张梯子跑过去，就在这时候，敌人的机枪扫射过来，张培珍被陷在护城壕里，他把头露在水外，抓着一颗小树让子弹在头顶上横飞。队伍发现不见张培珍，大家乱七八糟的猜想：“可能是中了子弹，负了伤，牺牲了，或者…………”只有到晚上再想办法。但是张培珍同志自己回来了。
    连长同志首先跳起来欢迎他，接着大家都围拢来问长问短，真是高兴。张培珍的衣服水湿透了，于是有人拿来自己的干衣给他换；张培珍的腿被水浸肿了，有人竟拿来五条裤子给他穿上。“不行！你一定要穿的厚厚的，要出汗，一出汗腿就好了。”张培珍喝过了不知那个递来的热汤，然后就睡下出了汗，他的腿也就很快的消了肿。
    他是国民党五十五师七十四旅二二一团的一个机枪射手，河南正阳人，被国民党抓来当兵已经五六年了，去年春季曾经被八路军俘虏，停战令下后，八路军放他回去，最近又被俘来。到八路军后，他对人讲：“这一次我是再也不回去了，叫我走，我也不走，给我多少钱我也不走了，八路军真是老百姓的队伍，在八路军里牺牲流血也真是光荣的啊。”
