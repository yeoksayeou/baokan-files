    Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 6th—The Eighth Route Army guerrillas in the suburbs of Beiping recovered the scenic Xiangshan and Wenquan, more than 30 li west of Beiping, on the 19th of last month. The next day, the Chengzishan stronghold was also liberated nearby. It is reported that Wenquan Town was liberated by the Eighth Route Army in August of last autumn, and then occupied by Chiang's troops in December. This is the second recovery. The guerrillas' liberation of the above two places proves that the rear of Chiang's troops attacking Zhangjiakou is very empty.

　　进犯张垣蒋军后方空虚
    平郊我克温泉
    【新华社张家口六日电】北平郊外八路军游击队已于上月十九日恢复北平以西三十余里的名胜香山、温泉，翌日复解放附近城子山据点。按温泉镇曾于去秋八月间为八路军解放，旋于十二月为蒋军侵占，此次为二次恢复。游击队解放上述两地，证明进攻张垣蒋军后方十分空虚。
