　　Warmly Welcome Returning Frontline Soldiers
    Xing City Holds Labor Appreciation Conference
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai] Just as the city-wide Patriotic Movement Week concluded, a battalion of the Taihang Guard Regiment, which participated in the Patriotic Self-Defense War on the front lines, victoriously returned and passed through our city. The masses in the West Gate Street area, having raised their awareness through education during the Patriotic Movement Week, automatically vacated their houses upon hearing that troops were to be stationed, pointing out "vacate whichever house needs to be vacated." They also offered to provide all the firewood for the troops. The advance unit of the headquarters was very pleased.
    On the morning of October 1st, the Labor Committee held a military-civilian get-together and appreciation conference at West Gate Square. Attending were all officers and soldiers of the Guard Battalion, the masses from the West Gate area, representatives from political and civilian organizations, the Women's Elementary School, the Dianshi Street Yangge team, and others, totaling over 4,000 people. At the beginning of the meeting, the Women's Elementary School presented flowers to model combatants. Deputy Section Chief Wang of the Municipal Government, on behalf of the citizens of the city, paid tribute to the Border Region's own sons and daughters who fought in self-defense to protect the people. Chairman Meng of the Relief Association spoke on behalf of various groups including workers, farmers, merchants, women, and children of the city, pointing out that the safety of Xing City mainly relies on the heroic and skilled Eighth Route Army soldiers on the front lines. Therefore, on behalf of the appreciation conference, they presented 400,000 Jibi currency, 1,500 catties of millet, 100 bars of soap, 20 bullets, 10 pairs of socks, 4 toothbrushes, 1 set of stirrups, and 2 pairs of pants. Finally, Instructor Ou replied on behalf of all the officers and soldiers, expressing that they would resolutely complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek die-hard reactionaries, and protect the liberated areas so that the masses could live and work in peace and contentment. After the speeches, performances began. In addition to the Women's Elementary School, Dianshi Street, and West Gate Street Yangge teams participating in the performances, the Shangde Fang Yangge team also came to participate on their own initiative. In the evening, the China Grand Theater provided free entertainment to all officers and soldiers.
