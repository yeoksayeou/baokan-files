　　The Logistics Station Work in Central Shandong
　　Emerges with a Large Number of Model Workers
    Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th—Huang Yiyuan, Political Commissar of the Central Shandong General Logistics Station, recently told reporters regarding the frontline supply and transportation work in this self-defense war: The Central Shandong District has established five general logistics stations and twenty-three branch stations. Each station is composed of military logistics departments, government, and representatives of the masses. After the outbreak of battles in various locations, they directly participate in the service. They are equipped with sufficient provisions, medicines, and medical personnel, and can mobilize enough laborers to participate in the war in a very short period of time. He continued: In the logistics station work of this self-defense war, a large number of model workers who "work first, rest later" and closely cooperate with the laborers have emerged. During the self-defense war along the Zhangdian-Boshan road east, the second-class disabled veteran Jia Rushu stayed up for two days and nights to mobilize laborers. When leading the laborers, he prepared tea and meals on time and carefully helped the laborers overcome difficulties when crossing rivers and ditches, making an old man exclaim with emotion, "My own son couldn't be this good." Due to the care of logistics station personnel Zhou Wei, the morale of the laborers participating in the war was even higher. In the Xiling battle south of Zhangqiu, as the laborer Li Yuxian was rescuing the wounded, shells began to explode beside him. He placed the wounded in a gully and used his body to shield them, resulting in his foot being injured by shrapnel. The wounded man said with tears in his eyes, "You were injured for me!" Li Yuxian comforted the wounded man in every way, saying, "This little bit doesn't matter; we are all doing this to fight the reactionaries." When the gunfire subsided slightly, they vied with each other to have the other leave the front line first to bandage their wounds. Unable to reach a compromise, they finally helped each other to the hospital.

　　鲁中的兵站工作
    涌现大批模范工作者
    【新华社临沂十三日电】鲁中总兵站处黄益源政委顷就此次自卫战中前线供应运输工作告记者称：鲁中区已建立总兵站五处、分站二十三处，各站均由军队后勤部门、政府与群众代表所组成。各地战役发生后，即直接参加服务。配备有足够之粮秣、医药与医务人员，并能在极短期间内动员足够的民夫参战。继谓：在此次自卫战兵站工作中，已涌现大批“工作在前、休息在后”及与民夫亲密合作的模范工作者。在张（店）博（山）路东展开自卫战时，二等残废贾如恕曾两昼夜未眠，出外动员民夫，在带领民夫中则准时备妥茶饭，过河过沟细心帮助民夫克服困难，使一位老大爷感动地说：“我自己的儿子也没有这么好”。由于兵站人员周韦的关照，民夫参战情绪更为高涨。在章邱南分锡岭战斗中，民夫李玉先在抢救伤员们，炮弹开始在他身旁爆炸，他即将伤员安置在山沟里，以自己身体掩护伤员，致足部中弹片受伤。伤员感动得流着泪说：“你为我而挂彩了！”李玉先却多方安慰伤员说：“这一点点不要紧，咱们都是为了打反动派。”炮火稍息时，他们互相争着要对方先下火线包扎，相持不下，最后便互相搀扶着到医院。
