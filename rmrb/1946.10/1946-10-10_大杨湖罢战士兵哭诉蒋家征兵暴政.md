(This article was transmitted by our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 6th) More than 200 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who laid down their weapons in the Longhai Campaign and the Dayang Lake battle spontaneously held a meeting on September 28 in the military region's training regiment to denounce the misery of being forced to participate in the civil war. Liu Yun, a soldier of the 55th Division, cried and said: "All four of my brothers were conscripted, leaving only my eighty-year-old mother at home. My eldest and second eldest brothers died fighting the New Fourth Army in Laohekou, Hubei. The third eldest was sent to the Northeast, and I don't know if he is dead or alive. My eighty-year-old mother has no one to take care of her, and we have no land at home. She must be more dead than alive now." Li Zhiyuan, a soldier of the 367th Regiment, said with tears streaming down his face: "I used to run a butcher shop. Xu Ziyi, the commander of the 367th Regiment, often invited friends to my shop to eat and drink heavily. He ate up all my capital. When I asked him for money, he told me to go to the regimental headquarters to get it. When I went, I was押 (yā) to the company, given a set of green military uniforms, and forced to become a soldier." Zhang Wenming, a soldier of the 55th Division, exposed the corruption of Chiang's army officers, saying: "Every hundred catties of grain is mixed with fifteen catties of sand and soil. The wheat and coal that are saved are all embezzled by them. Last winter, no cotton-padded clothes were distributed, so the soldiers crushed tree bark and stuffed it into their lined clothes. Many brothers fell ill from the cold." The last Chiang Kai-shek soldier said angrily: "All these sufferings are caused by Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. Otherwise, we would have gone home for a family reunion long ago. We must take revenge and follow the Eighth Route Army to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!"

　　大杨湖罢战士兵哭诉蒋家征兵暴政
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】在陇海战役及大杨湖战斗中放下武器之蒋军士兵二百余人，于九月二十八日在军区教导团自动举行诉苦大会，哭诉被迫参加内战的惨状。五十五师士兵刘运哭着说：“我弟兄四人都给抓丁抓光了，家里只剩一个八十多岁的老母亲，我大哥和二哥开到湖北老河口打新四军时死了，三哥开到东北不知死活，八十岁的老母亲无人照顾，家里又无田地，现在一定是死多活少了。”三六七团士兵李志远涕泪横流地说：“我本是开肉店的，三六七团团长徐子义常邀朋友来我店里大吃大喝，我的本钱全给他吃全了，向他要钱，他就跟他到团部里去取，我跟去时却被押到连里，给我换上一套绿军服，强迫我当了兵。”五十五师士兵张文明揭发蒋军军官贪污情形说：“每百斤粮食掺入十五斤砂土，节约的麦子和煤炭都被他们食污了，去年冬天没发棉衣，士兵都用树皮捣烂了塞在夹衣里，许外弟兄们都冻病了。”最后一个蒋军士兵愤恨的说：“这些苦处都是蒋介石打内战给我们的，要不我们早就回家团圆啦，我们一定要报仇，跟着八路军打垮蒋介石的进攻！”
