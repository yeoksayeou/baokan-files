　　Chiang Kai-shek's "Triumphant Return" Dream Shattered
    *Liberation Daily* Tenth of the Month Commentary

    Today is the Double Tenth Festival. According to Chiang Kai-shek's plan, a "celebration" should be held in Zhangjiakou. However, news came that on the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, Chiang's army suffered another heavy blow in the suburbs of Huailai, 200 miles away from Zhangjiakou. The 43rd Division of the 94th Army, newly transferred from the Beining Railway and thrown into the frontal offensive, was annihilated by 2,500 men. This must be a bit disappointing for Chiang Kai-shek.
    Since Chiang's army suffered repeated setbacks on the first line of defense of the Eighth Route Army on the Ping-Sui East Line on the periphery of Zhangjiakou, and the Eighth Route Army beat them to pieces on the Ping-Han North Line, with a total loss of 15,000 men, Chiang Kai-shek then colluded with American imperialism to release a smokescreen of "ten days of ceasefire," and launched a "peace offensive" in propaganda. At the same time, he hurriedly transferred the American-equipped 94th Army to reinforce the attack, and used American-made B-29s to bomb this people's city in turn, attempting to assimilate and destroy the self-defense fighting will of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, and to rush into Zhangjiakou in one go. However, Chiang Kai-shek's trick obviously failed once again. The "peace" smokescreen can only confuse individual American reporters who are willing to be used, and it has no effect on the sane military and civilians in the liberated areas. The indiscriminate bombing by American-made Chiang planes not only failed to scare the resolute people in the heroic city, but also aroused their infinite resentment and hatred for the traitors and American imperialists. They shouted, "This is a blood debt," and "We want to see Chiang Kai-shek's end." In the past few days, prices in the rear of Zhangjiakou have been stable, and the order is as stable as usual. Factories have been increasing production one after another, and a large number of workers and peasants have poured into the front lines. The Eighth Route Army on the front line is launching attacks in separate directions. The Eighth Route Army on the western front has already bypassed to the rear of Fu Zuoyi and attacked Baitaqi and Taobqi, threatening the supply and communication lines of the Fu army; the Eighth Route Army on the eastern front has annihilated the invading army again and again. Thousands of Chiang's army corpses have been piled up outside Huailai and Yanqing, and the wilderness north of the Great Wall will become the graveyard of Chiang's army.
    These facts should shatter Chiang Kai-shek's dream of a "triumphant return." If Chiang Kai-shek insists on rejecting the demands of the Chinese people and does not withdraw the illegally mobilized troops and occupied territories after the ceasefire order, then no matter what tricks Chiang Kai-shek uses, the military and civilians in the liberated areas will resolutely resist.

　　蒋介石“凯旋”好梦的破灭
    解放日报十日时评
    今天是双十节，按照蒋介石的计划，是应该在张家口城内举行“庆祝”，然而消息传来，双十节的前夕蒋军在距张家口二百里的怀来城郊又挨了沉重的一棒。新从北宁路调来投入正面进攻的九十四军四十三师被歼灭了二千五百人，这对于蒋介石未免有些扫兴吧。
    自从蒋军在张垣外围平绥东线八路军第一道防线接二连三的受挫、平汉北线又被八路军打的落花流水、前后损失合计达一万五千人，以后蒋介石便一面勾通美帝国主义放出“休战十天”的烟幕，在宣传上展开一个“和平攻势”，一面急忙赶调美械装备的九十四军增援猛扑，并以美制空中堡垒轮番狂炸这一人民城市，企图同化和摧毁解放区军民自卫的战斗意志，一鼓气冲进张家口。但是，蒋介石的鬼计显然再一次破产了，“和平”烟幕只能迷惑个别甘心被利用的美国记者，对于头脑健康的解放区军民丝毫不起作用。美造蒋机滥肆轰炸，不但吓唬不了英雄城中的刚毅人民，而且更加引起了他们对卖国贼及美帝国主义者的无比愤恨和仇恨，他们高呼“这是血债”，“我们要看蒋介石的下场”。这几天张家口后方物价稳定，秩序安定如常，工厂纷纷增产，大批工人农民涌上前线。而前线八路军则正分头出击，西线八路军已抄到傅作义后方袭击白塔、陶卜齐，威胁傅军供应联络线；东线八路军一而再再而三的歼灭进犯军，怀来、延庆城外已堆起成千具蒋军尸体，塞北原野将成为蒋军坟墓。
    这些事实，应当粉碎蒋介石“凯旋”的好梦。如果蒋介石坚持拒绝中国人民的要求，不撤退停战令后非法调动的军队和侵占的地方，那末不管蒋介石用什么鬼计，解放区军民必然坚决抵抗下去。
