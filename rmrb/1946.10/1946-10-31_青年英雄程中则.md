　　Young Hero Cheng Zhongze
    Tian Xuan
    Cheng Zhongze is one of the heroes who emerged from the Lanzhou-Fengqiu campaign at 6051. He was a communication soldier in the 5th Company, a Communist Party member since 1946, and only twenty years old this year. He joined the army last year when the counter-offensive started to protect the fruits of victory. His greatest characteristic is his consistent enthusiasm, zeal, and responsibility. For example, taking in the sick during marches was originally the political instructor's responsibility, but he took on most of this work. He ran back and forth along the way, urging the sick to keep up, telling the instructor who had fallen behind, who hadn't kept up, carrying guns for the sick, carrying two guns to the destination, tidying up houses, setting up beds, fetching water, and staying busy until very late before going to sleep, and the next day was the same. Because of his consistent enthusiasm, the Party branch introduced him to the Party. Since then, his enthusiasm has increased, and the consciousness of a Party member was fully demonstrated in this Lanzhou-Fengqiu campaign.

    During the Lanzhou-Fengqiu campaign, the political instructor was ill. He stayed by his side at all times during the march across the river, taking care of the instructor's livestock in waist-deep water. His own clothes were completely soaked, but he didn't say a word, taking care of him all the way to the destination. The instructor couldn't move and needed someone to be with him, so he didn't let him go to the front line. He was angry at this time. He thought: Why don't they let me go? I can't not participate in such a big battle? After his request was denied, he thought of a way and said to the instructor, "The deputy battalion commander asked me to go to the front!" The instructor half-believed and didn't reply. Later, when he saw the deputy battalion commander and asked about it, the deputy battalion commander said, "I never said that!" Since he didn't say that, the instructor wanted to keep him. He cried and went to the political director and said, "Everyone else is going to the front, what am I doing staying behind as a Communist Party member?" The political director was busy and didn't bother to deal with these things. He came back and said to the instructor himself, "I must go!" The instructor said, "Go if you want to go." At this time, he was happy. Because he wouldn't even talk to the instructor when he wasn't allowed to go, now he was friendly with him again, taking out the one hundred yuan that the instructor had given him and saying, "I'm leaving, this is your money, you can use it! ......" After saying that, he walked out, but thinking that this might be a farewell, and that he had disobeyed him like that just now, he walked back to comfort the instructor: "I'm leaving, you should have Guo Wen stay with you! " Only then did he go to the front line.

    Nighttime communication was difficult. Under intense enemy fire, he went back and forth to communicate and deliver messages, until the troops entered the city. The deputy battalion commander ordered him to go through the enemy's tightly sealed area to notify the 5th Company to charge. He knew very well that no one could escape here. Sure enough, his arm was broken by the enemy here.

    Generally speaking, a young man, especially if he is wounded for the first time, is mostly flustered, but he was different. After being wounded, no one could rescue him, so he calmly crawled down himself.

    Zhongze has a paternal cousin named Zhongqing, who was also in the 9th Company. Seeing that he was wounded, he planned to send him down, but he disagreed and said, "I can go down myself, the enemy has already started to panic, you hurry up and charge ......" When crossing the city wall, the enemy shot him a second time, but he still persevered and arrived at the aid station. The aid station didn't have any stretchers and could not transport him down, which was the most unsatisfactory thing for Cai Hao. Others hurried to explain to him, and he nodded and said, "I know it's all difficult!" He still had that usual expression, just a little pale.

    Arriving at the rear, he couldn't see the instructor. He waited for a long time. As soon as he saw him, because of their usual feelings, he was excited and wanted to cry, but he held it back. When the instructor comforted him, he said nothing except that he was considering that his arm was crippled and he couldn't work.

    He is still in the hospital now. A few days ago, he even wrote a letter to comfort the instructor, saying that he would be fine soon and not to worry. In fact, it is said that his arm is still swollen!

    That day, after he came down from the battlefield, his brother, according to his instructions, charged up, and sure enough, the enemy collapsed. His brother and another hero captured forty-six prisoners.

    People are moved by Comrade Zhongze's rare enthusiasm, courage, and calmness. But he is just one of the countless heroes in the Lanzhou-Fengqiu campaign.

　　青年英雄程中则
    天玄
    程中则是六○五一在兰封战役中出现的英雄之一，他是五连的通讯员，一九四六年的共产党员，今年才二十岁。去年反攻开始，为保卫果实他参加了部队，他的最大特点就是一贯积极、热情、负责，譬如说行军收容病号，本来是指导员的责任，但是他却把这个工作做了大半，一路跑来跑去，督促病号跟上，告诉指导员谁谁又掉队了，谁谁没有跟上来，给病号把枪背上，扛上两支枪走到目的地，收拾房子、支床打水，一直忙到很晚才睡下，第二天又是如此。因为他的一贯积极，支部介绍他入党了，自此以后，他的热情又增加了，党员的觉悟性在这次兰封战役完全表现出来了。
    兰封战役时指导员有病，行军过河他时刻不离左右，在深可及腰的水中，招呼着指导员的牲口，自己的衣裳湿完了，也不说句什么，一直照护到目的地。指导员因不能行动离不了人，不叫他上前线，他这时可恼了，他想：为什么不叫我去呢？这样大的战役我能不参加？要求无效之后，他想了一个办法，向指导员说：“副营长叫我到前头去哩！”指导员半信半疑的没作答复，后来见到副营长问及此事，副营长说：“我那里说过这话！”既然没有这话，指导员还要留他，他气哭了，去找教导员说：“人家都去前头，我是共产党员留在后边干什么？”教导员正忙，顾不的管这些事，他自己回来向指导员说：“我一定要去！”指导员说：“你去就去吧。”这时他高兴了。因为不叫他去连话也不和指导员说，现在又和他亲切起来，掏出指导员给他的一百元钱来说：“我去了，这是你的钱还给你用吧！………”说完走了出去，但想到这也许就是生离死别，刚才又那样违抗了他，于是又走回来安慰指导员：“我走了，你在家叫郭文跟你在一起吧！”这才走上火线。
    夜间连络困难，在猛烈的敌火之下，来回联络送信，一直到部队攻入城内，副营长命令他通过敌人严密封锁的地带去通知五连冲锋，他很知道没有人能在这里幸免，果然，就在这里他的胳膊给敌人打断了。
    一般说来，一个青年尤其是第一次负伤，大都是发慌的，但他却不一样，负伤之后没有人能去救护，他自己很沉着的爬了下来。
    中则有一个叔伯兄弟名叫中庆，也在九连，看到他负伤了，打算送他下来，他不同意的说：“我自己能下去，敌人已经开始混乱了，你赶快去冲………”在越过城墙时，敌人二次又打了他一枪，但他仍然支持下来到了救护所。救护所没有担架了，彩号运不下去，这本来是最使彩号不满意的事，别人急忙向他解释，他点点头说：“我知道都是困难！”仍然是他那平常面孔，就只是发黄一点。
    来到后方，见不到指导员，他等了好久，一见了面，因为平时的感情，他激动的想哭，但是忍了下去，指导员安慰他时，他除了考虑到那只胳膊残废了不能工作外，什么也没说。
    他现在还在医院，前几天还来信安慰指导员，说他很快的就要好了，不要挂念。其实据说他的胳膊还肿着呢！
    那天他从战场下来后，他兄弟依着他的嘱托冲上去了，果然，敌人溃散了。他兄弟和另一位英雄活捉了四十六个俘虏。
    人们都为中则同志这种稀有的热情，勇敢和镇定而感动。但他只是兰封战役中无数英雄中的一个。
