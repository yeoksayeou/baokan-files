　　Powerful Contributions to the Production Increase Movement
    Wu Changhai
    Wang Fei Invent New Tools
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] In the new heroic production increase movement to support the patriotic self-defense war, Comrade Wu Changhai, the chairman of the trade union of the Xinhua Paper Mill in Changzhi City, and Comrade Wang Xinwen, the manager, have researched and developed a wooden pulping cart to improve production efficiency. After initial trial use, it can save seven laborers and eight hours of time per day. This cart is specially used for pulping "Han" (raw materials in the pool). In the past, pulping each "Han" of material (each pool of hemp) required two people for one and a half hours, so four "Hans" required eight people for twelve hours. Now, with the pulping cart, pulping can be done at any time, requiring only one person. One person can pulp one "Han" very skillfully in one hour, so four "Hans" only take one person four hours. They are still continuing to research and improve it, aiming to ensure that there are no lumps in the pulped material. (Xinhua Paper Mill Correspondence Group)
    [Another report] Comrade Wang Fei, the director of the Huguan County Cooperative, and experienced technicians from the Cooperative's iron and woodworking factory, have patiently researched and created two types of tools, which have now been successfully tested. These tools not only increase the production of iron but also improve its quality. They are introduced as follows: 1. Windmills replace bellows: Similar to the windmills used for sifting grain, but the air nozzle opens at the bottom and is tightly connected to the iron smelting furnace. The effect: Previously, using bellows, a furnace was tapped once a month, requiring 240 man-days, producing 10,500 catties of ordinary iron and 2,100 catties of high-quality iron. After switching to windmills, a furnace is tapped seven times a month, requiring 120 man-days, saving half the labor compared to before. It can produce 12,050 catties of ordinary iron and 3,350 catties of high-quality iron, an increase of 14% and 16% respectively. 2. Treadle wheels replace hand-pinched crucible covers: Previously, crucible covers were made by hand. One person could make a maximum of 45 covers per day. Using treadle wheels to manufacture crucible covers allows one person to make 90 to 130 covers per day, more than doubling the speed.
    Since the invention of these two tools, the county cooperative is working to promote them, making them available to every furnace site. Workers and factory managers are happily saying: "This way, it's faster and saves labor, so we can earn more money!" (Luan Cooperative General Agency Correspondence Group)

　　增产运动中的有力贡献
    武昌海
    王飞发明新工具
    【本报长治讯】在支援爱国自卫战争的新英雄主义增产运动中，长治市新华造纸厂工会主任武昌海同志和经理王新文同志，为提高生产效率，特研究出一种木质打料车，现经初步试用，每天可节省劳力七个、时间八小时。此车专为打汉（打池里的原料）使用，过去打汉每汉料（每一池的麻）需两个人一点半钟打，四个汉料八个人，得十二个钟头，现用打料车能随时打，用一个人即行，一个人一个汉一个钟头打的很熟，四个汉一个人有四小时即行。现他们仍在继续研究改进，要做到打出料来没有一点圪瘩。（新华纸厂通讯小组）
    【又讯】壶关县联社长王飞同志和联社铁木工厂有经验的技术工人，经耐心研究创造出两种工具，现已试验成功，不但提高了铁的产量，而且提高了质量。特介绍如下：一、风车代替风匣：和ｓｈāｎ＠①谷的风车相像，但风嘴是在下边开着，和炼铁炉紧紧相连。其效果：原用拉风匣一个月出一次炉，用人工二百四十个，产普通铁一万零五百斤，光铁二千一百斤。改用风车后，一个月出七次炉，用人工一百二十个，比原来省工二分之一，可产普通铁一万二千零五十斤，光铁三千三百五十斤，较前提高了百分之十四和十六。二、蹬轮代替手捏搭锅：搭锅以前用手捏，一个人一天最快做四十五个，用蹬轮制造搭锅，一天一个人能做到九十至百三十个，比以前快到一倍以上。
    这两件工具发明以后，县联社正在设法推广，使之普及到每一个炉场上。工人厂方都高兴的说：“这样一来又快又省力，该咱赚钱哩！”（潞安合作总社通讯小组）
