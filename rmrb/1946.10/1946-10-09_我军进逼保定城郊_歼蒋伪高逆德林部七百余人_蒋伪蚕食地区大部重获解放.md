　　Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 5th: Following the victory in the first phase of the self-defense counter-offensive operation, the Eighth Route Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Front continued to advance on the isolated outskirts of Baoding, recovering seven strongholds including Suncun. On the evening of the 3rd, when a unit of the Eighth Route Army attacked the Suncun stronghold northeast of Baoding, the Chiang puppet troops stationed there attempted to flee into the city, but were pursued by the Eighth Route Army. The entire two battalions of the puppet Gao Delin's troops were annihilated, with over 500 killed or wounded and over 200 captured alive. One mortar, two heavy machine guns, over twenty light machine guns, and over four hundred rifles were seized. On the afternoon of the same day, Huangqiaozha and Dongxi Shiqiao strongholds south of Baoding city were also liberated. On the 4th, Changbao, Nan Yanwang, and Zangcun and other strongholds were liberated. By this point, most of the areas around Baoding that had been gnawed away by Chiang's puppets after the ceasefire order had been recovered, and the people regained their freedom.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd: (Delayed) After the news of the great victory of the Eighth Route Army's self-defense counter-offensive on the Pinghan Front arrived, the whole city was excited, and various organizations inquired about the details from this agency by telephone. More than 10,000 copies of the extra edition of the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily appeared on the streets and were immediately snapped up by the citizens. The New Zhangjiakou Theater wrote this good news in large characters before its opening, and the audience responded with warm cheers and applause. After learning of this good news, the Ping-Sui Railway Trade Union immediately notified all its branches by telephone. All employees believed that another 250 li of the Pinghan Railway belonged to the people, and Chiang Kai-shek had lost an important tool for the civil war. Congratulations were offered to the employees of the Pinghan Railway who were liberated by the Eighth Route Army. Mayor Yang Chunpu of the Municipal Government said: "This victory confirms the great self-defense power of the people. This is a strong support and the greatest encouragement to the military and civilians of Chahar Province, especially Zhangjiakou. We will learn from the victorious soldiers on the Pinghan Road and eliminate the invaders on the Ping-Sui Road!" Mr. Yan, the accountant of the Victory Restaurant, said repeatedly after hearing the news: "Good! Good! Very good! If we win a few more such great victories, Chiang Kai-shek will not dare to attack the border area again!"
