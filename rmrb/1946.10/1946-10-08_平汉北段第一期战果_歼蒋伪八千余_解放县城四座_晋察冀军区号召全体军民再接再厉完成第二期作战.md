　　First Phase Victory on the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway
    Annihilating Over 8,000 Chiang and Puppet Troops, Liberating Four County Towns
    The Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Calls on All Soldiers and Civilians to Continue Efforts to Complete the Second Phase of Operations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 4th] After Chiang's troops on the Ping-Sui Eastern Front launched an offensive against Zhangjiakou, the Eighth Route Army in Jin-Cha-Ji, under the unified command of General Nie Rongzhen, launched a counter-attack in self-defense against Chiang's troops on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, achieving significant results. The Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Headquarters has issued a public communique on the comprehensive combat results of the first phase (from 2100 hours on September 29th to 0400 hours on the 3rd of this month, when Dingxing County was recovered) of the Ping-Han Northern Section Campaign, stating that, according to preliminary statistics, the four county towns of Wangdu, Xushui, Dingxing and Rongcheng were liberated, as well as ten stations including Gaobeidian, Dingxing, Beihedian, Gucheng, Xushui, Caohe, Yujiazhuang, Wangdu, Wangjing and Fangshunqiao. The ten important towns of Beihedian, Gucheng, Caohe, Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, Balizhuang, Shilipu, Wangjing, Qingfengdian, and Beicheng were captured, as were 47 group strongholds. More than 250 li of railway were controlled. More than 3,500 Chiang and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and more than 4,800 officers and soldiers, including Kang Mufei, deputy commander of the puppet 2nd Column, as well as deputy regimental commanders and battalion commanders, were captured. The following materials were seized: two mountain guns, eleven mortars, thirteen heavy machine guns, one hundred and nineteen light machine guns, three thousand one hundred and thirty-one long and short guns, more than twenty grenade launchers, more than eight hundred thousand rounds of ammunition, six radio stations, more than seventy war horses, two locomotives, two train carriages, and three military supply warehouses, one fully stocked with more than ten thousand sets of newly made cotton clothes, the second fully stocked with American flour, and the third fully stocked with various kinds of ammunition. In addition, two military vehicles were burned. The communique concludes by pointing out that although Chiang's troops have suffered a serious blow from the border region's soldiers and civilians, their delusion of eliminating the People's Liberation Areas and democratic forces will not be dispelled. The defensive battle outside Zhangjiakou is underway, and all soldiers and civilians in the border region must avoid complacency, continue their efforts, mobilize all forces, ensure the completion of the second phase of operations, cooperate with the defense of Zhangjiakou, and point the victorious edge of the self-defense counterattack directly at the heart of the Kuomintang reactionaries in North China.
