[This Newspaper Changzhi 6th Dispatch] In the in-depth mass movement in Bo'ai Sixth District, it was discovered that village cadres and activists were experiencing domestic dissatisfaction due to excessive lost work time, which also affected their work morale. District cadres immediately convened a meeting to study the reasons, and found that: 1. District cadres did not understand the difficulties of village cadres and wasted too much of their time. 2. Village cadres and militia themselves had muddled ideas such as "labor is shameful" and "fearing criticism for only caring about oneself." 3. Work time arrangement was inappropriate, leading to chaotic busyness. Therefore, first, addressing the ideological problems of village cadres, the slogan "Labor is the most glorious," "Thorough emancipation depends on labor" was proposed; secondly, it was decided that district cadres and village cadres would jointly study specific methods to liberate work time. After two days of effort after the meeting, the thinking of many village cadres has now been cleared. Qiu Lin, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "I was afraid others would say I was selfish and dared not go to the fields. This is not understanding that labor and production can consolidate the liberated areas." Zhou ××, militia captain of ×× Village, said: "Some people say it is shameful for cadres to carry manure, so I didn't carry it. I forgot that we rely on labor for a living; this is landlord thinking." The former chairman of Qianxinzhuang Farmers' Association said: "In the past, I thought I could live by only eating the fruits of the struggle, but today I understand that the fruits are dead, and the future still depends on working!" In terms of specific methods, villages such as Daxinzhuang, Tuwang, Qifang, and Shangzhuang created: (1) Village cadres take turns to work in the office, with one person at home every day to handle daily work; the remaining cadres go to production. (2) Trivial problems are not solved piecemeal but are solved centrally on rainy days and at night. (3) Meetings are not held unnecessarily; the role of the Farmers' Association groups is brought into play, and problems are solved anytime and anywhere. After doing this, cadres in other villages reflected very well. A cadre from Qianxinzhuang said: "I work hard, and my family is very happy!" Cadres from Daxinzhuang also said: "Everyone is happy this way."

　　提倡劳动发家反对坐吃山空
    村干部误工获得解决
    博爱六区采用轮流值日办法
    减少会议琐碎问题集中处理
    【本报长治六日电】博爱六区在深入群运中，发现村干部积极分子因误工太多，引起家庭不满，也影响了本人的工作情绪。区干部当即集会，研究其原因，发现：一、区干部不了解村干部困难，过多浪费其时间。二、村干部和民兵本身有“劳动丢人”，“怕人批评光顾自己”等糊涂思想。三、工作时间安排不当，乱忙。于是首先针对村干部思想问题，提出“劳动最光荣”，“彻底翻身靠劳动”的口号；其此决定由区干部与村干部共同研究解放工作时间的具体办法。会后经两日努力，许多村干部思想现已打通。秋林农会主席说：“我怕别人说我自私，不敢上地，这是不了解劳动生产能巩固解放区。”××村民兵队长周××说：“有些人说当干部担粪丢人，我也就不担啦，忘了咱是靠劳动生活，这是地主思想”。前新庄农会主席说：“以前我想光靠吃斗争果实就可以活，今天想通啦：果实是死的，将来的日子还是靠动弹哩！”在具体办法上，大辛庄、屠王、七方、上庄等村创造出：（一）村干部轮流办公，每天有一人在家处理日常工作；其余干部都去生产。（二）琐碎问题不零星解决，利用雨天与夜晚集中解决。（三）不必要时不开会，发挥农会小组的作用，随时随地解决问题。这样作后，其他各村干部反映都很好。前新庄×干部说：“我好好动弹，家人很高兴！”大辛庄干部也说：“这样大家都痛快”。
