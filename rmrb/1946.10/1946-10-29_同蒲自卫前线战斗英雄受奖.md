Before the meeting, the masses in nearby villages worked day and night to make red flowers and gifts for the heroes. The leaders of the troops and cadres at all levels welcomed them from afar to participate in the meeting. The sound of gongs, drums, and military music was mixed with enthusiastic greetings of "Glory to the heroes!" and "Good health to the heroes!" After the meeting began, the glorious deeds of more than two hundred heroes were introduced, such as Shi Mingde's night attack on Qin Fengzhen, Chen Jinyun's perfect accuracy, Liu Qingchun and Du Shouxin's calls to the enemy, Yao Duze's stretcher carrying, and cook Guo Baofu's delivering meals on the battlefield. Every combat hero and model worker wore a red flower and received a medal. Hero representative Li Huangniu said: "We must continue to display our resolute and courageous spirit, complete the tasks given to us by the people, and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's invading army!"
