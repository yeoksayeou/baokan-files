　　[From our newspaper in Wuzhi] Masses in the border areas of Wuzhi County have organized revenge squads, armed to resist the attacks, sabotage, and massacres by Chiang's puppet troops and their special agent forces, and have already achieved two victories. On the evening of the 29th of last month, our revenge squad raided Xin Yang Baofeng (more than twenty li east of Mulandiian) behind enemy lines. With extremely swift action, they compressed the puppet Fu Juye's unit into a courtyard. After fierce fighting, they killed 4 enemy personnel including a puppet adjutant, wounded two, captured four alive, and seized two rifles. On the 5th of this month, at 10 PM, the enemy attacked Xinzhuang in the Fifth District of Xiuwu, capturing 43 cadres and civilians, and 19 head of livestock. Upon learning this, the revenge squads of various villages immediately rushed to pursue and intercepted the enemy on their return route. As a result, they intercepted 21 civilians (not counting those who scattered and returned on their own), 9 head of livestock, and over 20 quilts and pieces of clothing at Bei Huo Village, returning them all to the masses, who were overjoyed.

　　武陟群众纷组复仇队
    袭击蒋伪连战连胜
    【本报武陟讯】本县边地群众纷组复仇队，武装抗击蒋伪军及其特务武装之袭击破坏与屠杀，已获两次胜利。上月二十九日黄昏，我复仇队奔袭敌后辛杨包峰（木栾店东二十余里）以极迅速之动作将伪傅继业部压缩到一座院子里，经激战后，毙伪副官以下四名，伤两名，生俘四名，缴步枪两支。本月五日晚十时敌袭我修武五区辛庄，捉去干部群众四十三人、牲口十九头。各村复仇队获悉，立即直扑尾追，并在敌之归路上堵击。结果在北霍村截下群众二十一口（跑散自回的未计），牲口九头，衣服被毯二十余床，全数退还群众，群众莫不欢欣若狂。
