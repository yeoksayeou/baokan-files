　　After Liberation, Urban and Rural People are Unprecedentedly United
    Taihang Merchants Go to the Countryside to Help with the Harvest
    Teachers and Students of the Military and Political University Help Harvest More Than a Thousand Mu
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 11th] Urban merchants going to the countryside to help farmers with the autumn harvest is a new phenomenon in the Taihang autumn harvest movement this year, fully demonstrating the unprecedented unity of urban and rural people after liberation. Shop employees in Lucheng Chengguan, under the leadership of the trade union, helped Yeke Village with the autumn harvest. One group of seventeen people harvested more than ten mu of grain in one afternoon. Merchants in Fucheng Town, Lingchuan, helped sixteen families of resistance members, completing the entire autumn harvest in two days. Merchants in Xiangyuan Chengguan took out sixteen head of livestock to help households without livestock plant wheat. Merchants in Lincheng, Jixi, also organized harvest assistance teams to go to the countryside to help farmers with the autumn harvest.
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 10th] All the teachers and students of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Military and Political University actively helped the military families and the masses in the駐地 [I think this means "stationed area"] with the autumn harvest. More than 800 people from the entire school harvested more than 1,700 mu in four days. Feng Shoujing, a student of the fourth cadre training team, who was physically disabled, and Shang Zhengzhi of the second team, who was ill, actively participated in the harvesting. They declined all the enthusiastic hospitality of the masses. The local masses said with emotion: "After the Eighth Route Army came, they helped us to liberate ourselves, helped us to cultivate the land, and helped us to harvest. They don't even eat a meal. We really can't repay this kindness."

    【本报长治十一日电】城市商人下乡帮助农民秋收，为太行今年秋收运动中的新现象，充分表现了翻身后城乡人民的空前团结。潞城城关的店员工人在工会领导下，帮助夜刻村收秋，一个组十七个人，一下午就割谷十余亩。陵川附城镇商人帮助十六户抗属，两天收完全部秋禾。襄垣城关商人抽出十六头牲口，帮助无牲口户种麦，冀西临城商人，亦组织助收队下乡帮助农民秋收。
    【本报长治十日电】晋冀鲁豫军区军政大学全体教职学员积极帮助驻地军属及群众收秋，全校八百余人，四天即收割千七百余亩。干训四队学员冯寿景一臂残废，二队尚政指带病，均积极参加收割。并谢绝了群众一切热情的招待。当地群众感动地说：“八路军来后帮助我们翻了身，帮助我们种地，又帮助收割，连顿饭也不吃，这恩情真是无法答报。”
