　　Ink and Blood
　　(Conclusion)
　　By Ailunbao, Translated by Wange
　　A Spanish song says:
　　"Some people sing what they understand,
　　Others understand what they sing..."
　　The farmer sings what he understands; the publisher of the Knoxville magazine also understands what he sings.
　　People want to provoke disputes between our two countries at any cost, openly saying they don't like Russia. I dare to add that these people don't like America either. They think of world domination, oil, atomic bombs, the Anglo-American bloc, and everything else, but not the children of America.
　　Many American newspapers talk about the "Iron Curtain," saying it separates us from the world. In reality, Russia is blocked by a smokescreen of lies, and this smokescreen is spread by American newspapers. The wind can blow away the smokescreen. What can clear the curtain of lies?
　　Many American correspondents complain that they cannot see anything in Russia. But to be correct, they cannot see those things that American newspapers can use as sensational headlines. They see daily work, but they crave sensation; they see the reconstruction of homes, but they prefer to report that the Soviet Union is preparing to seize Tehran, Honduras, or the moon.
　　I can tell them many things that excite us. We are excited when the factory that originally manufactured Petlyakov bombers is now making baby cradles. We are also excited when the factory that originally manufactured tanks is now making streetcars or milk cans. We are proud that the people of Leningrad are repairing their homes after work hours. We dream of rebuilding Kyiv. We write; we pay attention to the orphans of soldiers. Our young people are getting married; our widows are looking for their loved ones' graves and decorating them with flowers. We fought harder than anyone else, and we cherish peace more than anyone else. To say that our people have any aggressive plans is despicable and sinful.
　　There is no place where the interests of the Soviet Union and the United States conflict—neither on the world map nor in our hearts. America is a big country, and Russia is not small either. We can and must coexist peacefully. We do not want to force our tastes and ideas on others. I think we can learn a lot from America, and America also has much to learn from us. Learning is always better than war.
　　Although American journalists ask me why Russia has only one party and not two, I do not want to ask why there are two parties in America and not three or one, or why there is only one party in the southern states and not two. Every nation lives as it wishes; every country should respect each other, just as neighbors should respect each other.
　　Our two great nations have many things in common: courage and frankness, perseverance, straightforwardness, and optimism. When our soldiers met Americans on the Elbe River, they said, "They are good guys." Later, we became good friends on the Elbe River. Now Americans are on the Hudson or Mississippi River, and we are on the Volga or Ob River. Why should we argue? Diplomats like to sit at round tables and talk; it is their favorite furniture. Let's be honest, diplomats' round tables still have too many sharp corners. But the people are not diplomats; the people can gather frankly at round tables, and our two nations can mix and sit together; they can unite well, and nothing can separate them except lies and slander.
　　I parted with my friends in America. I left them with a heavy heart because I saw fear in their eyes. Malicious newspapers did their best: they deeply instilled in the hearts of many Americans the idea that a third world war is possible. There is an old French saying: "Talk more about Christmas, and Christmas will come."
　　The journalists' "Third World War" stories are dangerous; they instill in people's hearts the idea that something is inevitable, which can be avoided and must be avoided. Many people are not saving their ink, hoping that others will shed blood. The Allied countries have not yet finished the Nuremberg trials of war criminals, but many people who hate the Soviet Union are already paving the way for Hitler again. Is that what the Russians died for on the Oder River and the Americans died for on the Rhine River?
　　In all countries, including the United States, it is forbidden to sell drugs freely. But why do Americans allow their bad people to harm others with deadly drugs? In all countries, including the United States, defamation is sanctioned by law. But why do Americans allow defamation against 200 million people? Freedom is a great gift; nothing is more miraculous than freedom of speech, and nothing is more hateful than a big drug dealer pretending to be a healer, or a big thug pretending to be a defender of the weak.
　　I want to believe that the American people themselves will find the spiritual strength, awareness, and wisdom to say to those who are preparing for a "Third World War": "Enough! I will never pay for your ink with my blood."

　　墨水和鲜血
   （续完）
    爱伦堡作  万歌译
    一首西班牙歌说：
    “有些人唱他们所懂得的，
    别的人懂得他们唱的是什么……”
    这位农人唱他所懂得的；诺克斯维尔杂志的发行人也懂得他所唱的。
    人们想不惜任何代价发动我们两国之间的纷争，公开地说他们不喜欢俄国。我敢大胆地补充一句，这些人也不喜欢美国。他们想到世界统治，石油、原子弹，英美集团，以及任何事物，但没有想到美国的孩子们。
    美国的报纸很多谈到“铁幕”的，他们说它把我们从世界分开了，实际上，俄国是被谎言的烟幕阻挡着，而这一烟幕正是美国报纸所散布的。风可以吹散烟幕。有什么能够廓清谎言的幕呢？
    许多美国的通讯员埋怨说他们在俄国不能看到任何事物。但正确地说，是他们不能看到那些可供美国报纸用作激动的头条新闻的事情。他们看到日常工作，可是他们是渴求激动的；他们看到家宅的重建，可是他们喜欢报导苏联准备夺取德黑兰，洪都拉斯或月球。
    我可以告诉他们许多使我们激动的事情。当我们原来制造柏特里雅珂夫轰炸机的工厂现在改制婴孩的摇篮时，我们是激动的。原来制造坦克的工厂现在改为制造街车或牛奶罐时。我们也是激动的。我们很骄傲于列宁格勒的人民正在工作时间之后修理他们的住宅。我们梦想着重建基辅。我们写作；我们注意战士的遗孤。我们的青年们结婚了；我们的寡妇们在找寻她们爱人的坟墓并饰以鲜花。我们比谁都打得艰苦，我们对和平更比谁都看得宝贵。说我们的人民有什么侵略计划是卑鄙和罪过的。
    没有一处地方使苏美两国的利益相冲突。——无论在世界地图上或在我们心里。美国是一个大国，俄国也不很小。我们能够和平共处而且必需和平共处。我们不想以我们的趣味和意思勉强别人。我想我们可以从美国学习的很多，美国也有许多可以从我们学习。学习比战争总要好些。
    虽然美国记者们要求我答复为什么俄国只有一个政党而不是两个，我并不要问为什么在美国有两党，而不是三党或一党，或者在南部各州只有一党，而不是两党。每一民族随其志愿生活；各个国家应该互相尊重，就像隔壁邻居应该互相敬重一样。
    我们两大民族有好多地方是相同的：勇往直前和坦白、坚毅、爽朗、乐观。我们的战士在易伯河遇到美国人时，说：“他们是好家伙”。后来在易伯河上我们变成了好朋友。现在美国人是在赫德森或密斯士必河上，而我们是在伏尔加或奥勃河上。为什么我们要争执呢？外交家喜欢坐在圆桌上谈话，那是他们最爱的家具。让我们坦白地说，外交家的圆桌还太多梭角。但人民并不是外交家，人民是可以开诚聚坐在圆桌上的，而我们两个民族更能渗杂共坐；他们可以很好地团结，而没有东西可以分隔他们，除掉谎言和诽谤。
    我和在美国的朋友们分别了。我以沉重的心情离开他们，因为在他们眼睛里我看到惊恐。恶毒的报纸尽了他们的能事：他们在好多美国人的心里深植了第三次世界大战是可能的观念。有一句法兰西古语说：“多谈些圣诞节，圣诞节就来了”。
    记者们的“第三次世界大战”的故事是危险的，他们在人民心里深植了某些事情无可避免的观念，其实是能够避免而且一定要避免的。许多人不节省他们的墨水是希望别人流血。盟国尚未结束纽伦堡战犯的审判，但已经有许多厌恨苏联的人在重为希特勒铺路了。难道说俄国人死在奥得河，美国人死在莱因河，就是为的这个？
    在所有国家里，连美国在内，自由出卖毒品是被禁止的。但美国人为什么准许他们的坏人以致命的毒品害人呢？在所有国家，连美国在内，诽谤是受法律制裁的。但美国人为什么容让对二万万人民的诽谤呢？自由是一种伟大的天赋，没有东西比言论自由更神奇，也没有东西比一个大毒犯居然假装治病者，或一个大棍徒居然冒称是弱者的保卫人更可恶。
    我愿意相信美国人民自己将找到精神的力量，觉悟和智慧，来向那些准备“第三次世界大战”的人说：“够了！我决不愿用我的血来偿付你的墨水”。
