Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: The following is the text of a telegram from all circles in Yan'an responding to the "US Troops Out of China" movement conference to the United Nations General Assembly:
    To Secretary-General Lie of the United Nations, forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly: We have learned that your assembly has decided to include the issue of "foreign troops stationed in the territory of non-enemy countries" on the agenda, which we greatly welcome, and we would like to specifically draw your assembly's attention to the issue of US troops stationed in China. The presence of US troops in China has become a major factor in armed interference in China's internal affairs, expansion of the civil war, and threats to peace in the Far East. The entire Chinese people are now launching the "US Troops Out of China Movement" with surging national indignation, and hope that your assembly will provide strong support in the spirit of upholding world peace.

    【新华社延安十一日电】延安各界响应美军“退出中国”运动大会致联合国大会电文如下：
    联合国秘书长莱氏并转联合国大会：闻贵会决以“外国军队驻于非敌国领土”的问题列入议事议程，我们非常欢迎，并愿对于美国军队驻在中国的问题特别提起贵会注意。美军驻在中国，已成为武装干涉中国内政、扩大内战、威胁远东和平的重大因素，全中国人民现在正以高涨的民族义愤发动“美军退出中国运动”，希望贵会本维护世界和平的宗旨，予以有力的声援。
