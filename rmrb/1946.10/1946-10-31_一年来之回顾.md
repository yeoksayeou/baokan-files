　　A Review of the Past Year
    Gao Shuxun
    When our army revolted in Handan, it declared the three major propositions of peace, democracy, and a coalition government, vowing to strive to the end for the construction of an independent, free, democratic, happy, and Three People's Principles-based New China. Over the past year, warmongers, colluding with American imperialists, have vainly attempted to turn China into an American colony in exchange for the help of their foreign masters, expanding the civil war and realizing their dictatorial dreams. They have torn up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, which they signed themselves, destroyed the democratic movement, strengthened secret agent rule, and launched a nationwide civil war. Political, military, and economic sovereignty have all been handed over to the United States. Peace and democracy have been trampled upon and abandoned, and the nation and the people's livelihood have been sold out and utterly ruined. National industries are declining daily, the countryside is bankrupt, and the cries of suffering people are everywhere. The old and weak are left to die in ditches, and the strong are driven to desperate measures. Alas! How disastrous is the harm done to the country and the people by this evil government!

    Looking at the Liberated Areas: there is no imperialist aggression, the people universally enjoy democratic rights, they are adequately clothed and fed, and their culture is improving, presenting a vibrant scene. All these things, fair-minded people at home and abroad, can attest to. Commander Zhao Xitian, whom I met in Handan before, also acknowledged this as a fact. The ideals of the Three People's Principles are only being implemented, promoted, and magnified in the Liberated Areas. I, though not talented, respectfully offer a few points based on my personal experience over the past year, to inform my countrymen.

    First, the realization of "land to the tiller." What Dr. Sun Yat-sen struggled for for decades but could not achieve has now been initially realized in the Liberated Areas. Under the support of the democratic government, farmers are settling accounts with traitors, puppets, despots, and local bullies for their years of illegal encroachment and exploitation. Through peaceful, reasonable, and legal procedures, they are recovering the land and property that they deserve. For ordinary landlords, the policy of "25% rent reduction" is thoroughly implemented, eliminating excess exploitation. For wealthy farmers, their operations are supported and encouraged. In addition, the protection and encouragement of industry and commerce are strictly implemented, encouraging landlords to invest in industry and commerce to promote capitalist development. The democratic government also promotes labor mutual aid, rewards labor heroes, improves farming, and develops textile industries, greatly increasing the wealth of the people. The result of the implementation of these policies is: political consolidation, economic stability, no one picks up lost articles on the road, doors are not locked at night, beggars and bandits disappear, and social order is peaceful. As long as one has not lost their conscience, being in such a place will inevitably move them.

    Second, the power of the people is not to be trifled with. The broad masses of farmers have gained land, and their economy and culture have generally improved. In order to protect their vested interests, they have generated a self-defense force that is unafraid of death. When those who provoke a traitorous civil war attack this area, young and old, men and women, all voluntarily serve the patriotic self-defense war, either directly rushing to the front lines or serving in combat support duties. The organs, groups, factories, shops, workers, farmers, women, and students in the rear all rise up to support the front lines, spontaneously initiating production increases and savings, supporting and comforting the army, giving preferential treatment to military families, organizing substitute farming, guaranteeing military transportation, caring for the wounded, emptying houses and clearing the fields, preparing for war and enforcing martial law, with everyone united and of one heart and one mind. Their enthusiastic emotions and great spirit are truly enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts weep! I have read Chairman Mao's "On Coalition Government" and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's "On the Liberated Areas Battlefield." Only today do I deeply understand the meaning of the chapter on people's war. Warmongers who want to destroy this incomparably magnificent people's power with American equipment are simply daydreaming.

    Third, the sincerity with which the Communist Party treats people. I believe that as a soldier, it is my natural duty to defend the country and love the people. I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic consolation and sincere care from the people, government, and the Chinese Communist Party in the Liberated Areas. Since the establishment of the Democratic National Construction Army, the supply of clothing, food, medicine, firearms, and soldiers has been continuous. The sincere spirit is even more moving. The Liberated Areas are known for their hardship, but the treatment of our army is especially good. All of this is something that the Kuomintang would never be willing or able to do. I once said to the officers and soldiers of our army in a lecture: "The Kuomintang discriminates in treatment, and the Communist Party also discriminates in treatment. The difference is that the Kuomintang's discrimination is to be harsh to others and enrich themselves, while the Communist Party's discrimination is to be frugal to themselves and enrich others." Today, the troops' high political morale, strong fighting will, full spirits, and healthy physique are all things I have never seen in my decades of leading troops. For example, under the leadership of the Kuomintang, the rate of illness in the troops reached 80%, and the mortality rate from illness reached 6% to 7%. Today, in the Liberated Areas, the rate of illness has been reduced to 5% to 6%, which is still not as high as the past mortality rate, and the mortality rate from illness has been reduced to 0.2% to 0.3%. This is still limited by medical conditions. If the conditions can be improved, it will be even lower than this number. In the past, I often heard the saying that the Communist Party does not allow the existence of dissenting troops. Looking at this, it is clear where this kind of language comes from.

    Finally, I would like to describe the changes in the troops over the past year.

    The first is the relationship between officers and soldiers. It is undeniable that the relationship between officers and soldiers in our army in the past, like in all Kuomintang troops, was one of opposition between officers and soldiers and low morale. But now there has been a fundamental change. Taking the First Regiment as an example, from the uprising to the end of May this year, the act of beating and scolding gradually decreased. From June to the end of October, in the five months due to the implementation of the democratic system, there were only eight incidents of beating and scolding. And after being criticized, those who beat and scolded all realized their mistakes and turned to comforting and apologizing to those who were beaten and scolded. After the abolition of beating and scolding, the troops became more consolidated, and desertions were greatly reduced. Taking the statistics of desertions in the six months before the regiment's uprising as an index of 100, it was reduced to 25% after the uprising and before the implementation of the democratic system at the end of May, and it has been reduced to 5% from June to the present, and the air of unity and fraternity is abundant in the troops. For example, at the Mid-Autumn Festival reunion of the units directly under Commander Tian, the commander poured wine for the stableman to comfort him. Li Zhendong, a platoon leader of the headquarters' special service regiment, gave his own silk quilt to a soldier because his cotton quilt was wet by the rain. Wang Yuxin, a company commander of the First Regiment, tilled the land with his bare torso, setting an example and leading the soldiers to plant vegetables. Cadres at all levels of the Twelfth Regiment personally led the firewood-gathering movement to improve the troops' meals. All these things are also something I have never seen in my decades of leading troops.

    The second is the relationship between the army and the people. In the past, the relationship between our army and the people, although far from "rather let the Japanese devils come to burn and kill than let Tang Enbo be stationed!", was inevitably one of opposition between the army and the people due to the influence of the Kuomintang's policies. This relationship has also undergone a fundamental change after a year of rectification and training. During the summer harvest, the entire army helped the masses harvest more than 30,000 mu of wheat (formal statistics for the autumn harvest have not yet been made). As for helping the masses deliver manure, carry water, etc., there are even more instances to enumerate. What is even more noteworthy is that the political awareness of the officers and soldiers has been greatly improved, and their attitude towards the land reform policy in the Liberated Areas has developed from praising and extolling it to directly helping with it. When the local masses settled accounts with traitors, puppets, despots, and local bullies, the troops either supported the masses on the spot or exposed the traitors' and despots' destructive conspiracies to the masses. All these things have made our army establish a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses, and the masses have gradually recognized our army as their own army. The masses' help to our army, such as transporting coal, transporting grain, borrowing things, lending rooms, grinding flour, and providing labor, is all very enthusiastic. They constantly spontaneously launch military-comforting movements. For example, at a certain military-comforting conference of the Second Division, the masses in just one district donated as much as 500,000 border currency. The masses in the garrison of the First Regiment spontaneously comforted the officers and soldiers of the regiment during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which was also very enthusiastic. When the Sixth Regiment moved its garrison, the masses in the garrison spontaneously formed teams to send them off for several miles. The entire army frequently holds army-people forums and get-togethers. In the troops, they support the government and cherish the people, and in the localities, they support the army and give preferential treatment to military families, so that the troops, the people, and the government have achieved unprecedented unity. This kind of practice is as different as heaven and earth from the "five disagreements" in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

    In short, since the uprising, our army has received the love and care of the Chinese Communist Party, the democratic government of the Liberated Areas, and the people. Compared with the situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where we were excluded, discriminated against, and they tried every means to eliminate us, the contrast is truly incomparable. Looking back on the past and present, how can I not be filled with emotion?!

    Now, on this anniversary, looking around, the national disaster is deepening day by day, the struggle between loyalty and treachery is becoming more intense, and the power of the people is also growing stronger day by day. Our army vows to continue to work hard for the original intention of the uprising, improve quality, promote morale, and fight side by side with the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all revolutionary friendly forces. Although the warmongering autocrat relies on the assistance of his American masters and hopes to succeed for a while, the trend of the times and the will of the people, with the army and people of the Liberated Areas resisting in the front and the armed people's uprising harassing in the rear, will see his military strength diminish day by day, his economy become increasingly difficult, and he will eventually be unable to escape the just judgment of history. The Chinese nation's cause of striving for independence, peace, and democracy will surely succeed!

　　一年来之回顾
    高树勋
    本军邯郸起义时，曾宣示和平、民主与联合政府三大主张，誓为建设独立、自由、民主、幸福、三民主义新中国奋斗到底。一年以来，好战分子与美帝国主义者狼狈为奸，妄图将中国沦为美国殖民地，以换取其外国主子之帮助，扩大内战，实现其独裁迷梦。彼等已撕毁其亲手签订之停战协定与政协决议，摧残民主运动，加强特务统治，发动全国内战。内政、军事、经济各项主权拱手送美。和平、民主被摧残遗弃，民族、民生被出卖与破坏无余。民族工业，日趋凋敝，农村破产，哀鸿遍野，老弱转乎沟壑，壮者挺而走险。甚矣！恶政府之祸国殃民也！
    观夫解放区：无帝国主义之侵略，人民普遍享受民主权利，足衣足食、文化提高，呈现朝气蓬勃之景象。凡此种种，国内外公正人士，俱能道之。余前此在邯郸所会见之赵锡田师长，亦承认其为事实。三民主义之理想只在解放区获得实行、发扬与光大。余不敏，谨就一年来亲身体验，掬陈数端，为国人告。
    一曰耕者有其田之实现、总理奋斗数十年未能达成者，今日在解放区已初步实现。农民在民主政府扶助下，向奸伪、恶霸、土劣清算其积年非法侵夺与剥削，经过和平、合理、合法手续，收回应得土地财物。对于一般地主，则贯彻二五减租法令，取消超额剥削。对于富农经营，则扶植奖励。此外并严格实行保护与奖励工商业，鼓励地主转向工商业投资，以促进资本主义发展。民主政府并提倡劳动互助，奖励劳动英雄，改良农作，发展纺织，人民财富，大为增加。此种政策实施之结果为：政治巩固、经济稳定、路不拾遗、夜不闭户、乞丐盗匪绝迹、社会秩序安宁。只要天良未泯，身临斯地，未有不受感动者。
    二曰人民力量之不可侮，广大农民获得土地，经济文化普遍上升，彼等为保护其既得利益，乃产生奋不顾身之自卫力量。当卖国内战挑衅者进攻此区时，青壮老幼，纷纷自动为爱国自卫战争服务，或直接奔赴火线，或服役战斗勤务；其在后方之机关、团体、工厂、商店、工农、妇女、学生纷起支援前线：自动发起增产节约，拥军慰军，优待军属，组织代耕，保证军运，护理伤员，空舍清野，备战戒严，上下一致，同心同德；其情绪之热烈，精神之伟大，实足动天地而泣鬼神！余尝读毛主席《论联合政府》与朱总司令《论解放区战场》两书，其中人民战争之一章。于今日始深切领会其涵义。好战分子想以美国装备摧毁此无比雄伟之人民力量，不啻痴人说梦而已。
    三曰共产党之待人真诚。自问分属军人，卫国爱民乃条天职。厚荷解放区人民、政府与中共之热烈慰勉，真诚爱护，感奋无似。自成立民主建国军后，举凡被服、粮秣、医药、饷械兵员等之补给，源源不绝。其诚挚之精神尤足令人感动。解放区向以艰苦著称，而对本军则待遇特优。凡此一切均为国民党所决不肯亦决不可能为者。余尝向本军官兵训话时称：“国民党在待遇上分彼此，共产党在待遇上也是分彼此，所不同者，国民党之彼此为苛人肥己，共产党之彼此为刻己肥人。”今日部队政治情绪之高涨，战斗意志之旺盛，精神之饱满，体格之健壮，均为余带兵数十年来所未有。例言之，在国民党领导下时，部队疾病达百分之八十，疾病死亡率达百分之六至七；今日在解放区疾病已减至百分之五至六，尚不及过去死亡率之高，疾病死亡率已减至千分之二至三。此尚为医药条件所限制，如条件能得改善，当更低于此数。昔日常闻共产党不容异己部队存在之说，观乎此，则此种语言从何而来，当可了然矣。
    最后，余欲一述年来部队之变化。
    其一为官兵关系，无可讳言，本军过去官兵关系，正如一切国民党部队然，官兵对立，战志低落。但今已有基本变化。以一团为例，起义后至今年五月底，打骂行为逐渐减少。自六月到十月底五个月中，由于实行民主制度，打骂行为仅有八件。且打骂者受到批评后，皆自知其非，转向被打骂者安慰致歉。废止打骂后，部队日趋巩固，逃亡顿减。以该团起义前六个月逃亡统计作为指数一百，起义后迄五月底实行民主制度前，减为百分之二十五，六月迄今则减为百分之五，而且在部队中充溢团结友爱之空气。如：中秋田师直属队全体团圆会上，师长为伙马夫斟酒慰劳；总部特务团排长李振东因一战士棉被为雨淋湿，乃以自己绸被给士兵盖用；一团连长王玉信赤膊耕地，以身作则，领导士兵种菜；十二团各级干部亲自领导打柴运动，改善部队伙食。凡此种种，亦为余数十年来带兵之所未见者。
    其二为军民关系。本军过去在军民关系上，虽远不如“宁叫鬼子来烧杀，不让汤恩伯来驻扎！”然由于国民党政策的影响，军民对立，自亦不免。此种关系经一年来之整训，亦有基本变化。夏收时全军曾帮助群众割麦达三万余亩（秋收尚未作出正式统计）。至于帮助群众送粪、担水等，更不胜列举。尤足道者，官兵政治觉悟大大提高，对解放区土地改革政策，由讴歌颂扬发展为直接帮助，各部队在地方群众向奸伪、恶霸、土劣等清算时，或为群众当场撑腰，或向群众揭发奸霸破坏阴谋。凡此一切，均使本军与群众缔结血肉相关之联系，而群众亦渐认本军为其自己之军队。群众对本军之帮助，如运煤、运粮、借物、让房、磨面、支差等等均极踊跃。彼等不断自动发起劳军运动，如二师某次劳军大会仅一个区群众献金即达五十万边币之巨，一团驻地之群众中秋自动慰劳该团官兵，亦至热烈；六团移防时，驻地群众自动结队远送数里；全军经常举行军民座谈、联欢，在部队则拥政爱民，在地方则拥军优待军属，使部队与人民与政府，达到空前团结。此种做法实与国民党统治区之“五不和”判若天壤。
    总之，本军自起义迄今，荷承中共、解放区民主政府、人民爱护有加，关怀备至。较之在国民党统治区受排斥、遭歧视，千方百计必欲消灭而后快之情境，诚不可比拟。抚今追昔，能不慨然？！
    兹值周年，环顾字内，民族灾难日深，忠奸搏斗益烈，而人民之力量，亦日益壮大。本军誓为起义初衷、继续努力，提高质量、发扬士气、与八路军、新四军及一切革命友军，并肩奋斗。好战独夫虽恃其美国主子之援助，希图侥幸于一时，然潮流所趋，人心所向，解放区军民抗拒于前，民变武装困扰于后，将见其兵力日削、经济日窘，终难逃避历史之正义裁判。中华民族争取独立、和平、民主之事业，必抵于成！
