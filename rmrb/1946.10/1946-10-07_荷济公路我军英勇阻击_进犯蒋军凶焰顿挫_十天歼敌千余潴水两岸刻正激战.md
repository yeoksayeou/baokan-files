[This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Frontline] (This column) states: Since Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Army, known as the "Ever-Victorious Army," and the Eleventh Division (formerly the Eighteenth Army) invaded our Dingtao and Heze regions, they have continued to advance northeast along the Heze-Jining Highway. Under the continuous joint attacks of our main forces, local armed forces, and militia, the ferocity of this advancing army has been checked. From the 24th of last month to the present, they have only advanced eighty li in ten days and are now engaged in fierce fighting with our army on both banks of the Zhu River. Since the 1st of this month, the Chiang Kai-shek Fifth Army, which has occupied the Shatuji area on the west bank of the Zhu River, has made several attempts to invade our Longguji (about eighty li northeast of Heze and forty li southwest of Juye) with superior forces, but all have failed. On the 3rd, at the heavy cost of 500 men, they temporarily occupied our Guanzhuang (one li south of Longguji), but Longguji remains in our army's hands to this day. Simultaneously, the Chiang Kai-shek Eleventh Division on the east bank of the Zhu River launched an offensive, attempting to occupy the line of Dayiji, Sunguantun, and Liuguantun southwest of Juye, but was repelled by our army in the Caojiazhai area south of Dayiji. In this battle, an entire company of the Eleventh Division and its attached heavy machine gun platoon were annihilated. According to incomplete statistics, under the continuous attacks and attrition by our army and people, Chiang Kai-shek's two "Ever-Victorious Armies" have lost more than a thousand men in ten days.

　　荷济公路我军英勇阻击
    进犯蒋军凶焰顿挫
    十天歼敌千余潴水两岸刻正激战
    【本报冀鲁豫前线四日电】号称“常胜军”之蒋军第五军及第十一师（原第十八军），自侵占我定陶、荷泽地区后，继续沿荷（泽）济（宁）公路向东北进犯，在我主力、地方武装、民兵不断联合打击下，该股进犯军凶焰顿挫。上月二十四日迄今，十天内只前进了八十里，现正与我军在潴水河东西两岸激战中。自本月一日以来，进占潴水河西岸沙土集一带之蒋军第五军，几次企图以优势兵力侵占我龙堌集（荷泽东北约八十里，巨野西南约四十里）均未得逞。三日，以五百人之重大代价，暂时占我官庄（龙堌集以南一里），龙堌集至今仍在我军手中。潴水河东岸蒋军第十一师同时出动，企图占领巨野西南之大义集、孙官屯、刘官屯一线，亦被我军阻击于大义集以南曹家垓一带。此役十一师一个连及其附属之重机枪排全部被歼。据不完全统计，蒋介石这两个“常胜军”在我军民不断打击消耗下，十天内损兵折将在千人以上。
