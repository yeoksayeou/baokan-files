　　Turned-Over Masses Mutually Aid Materials to Boost Production
    Joint Celebration Held in All Streets of Wu'an City
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] On the 23rd of last month, the masses of the New Second Street and New Third Street in Wu'an City held a grand celebration and joint gathering to celebrate their liberation. Street Chief Du of New Third Street, amid thunderous applause and cheers, represented the masses of the Third Street in presenting 5.6 million yuan in cash and a portion of materials to the masses of the Second Street. He said, "The masses of the Third Street asked me to thank the brothers of the Second Street on behalf of everyone. In the past, we were oppressed by the great tyrant landlord Huo Laoxiang, unable to raise our heads at all; the brothers of the Second Street put aside their own lives to help us in our struggle. Today, we have completely turned ourselves over, and we have recovered the property that was extorted in the past. Our lives are already very prosperous. We have no way to repay the brothers of the Second Street. Everyone has voluntarily taken out this bit of money and goods, so that the brothers of the Second Street who have more difficult lives can improve their lives and have capital for production." As soon as his voice fell, folk music began to play, and the crowd cheered: "All common people under heaven are one family! Sharing joys and sorrows together!" Street Chief Guo, representing the masses of the Second Street, presented Street Chief Du with a banner that read "Loving Help for Liberation." The masses of the Second Street shouted in unison, "Wishing Street Chief Du and everyone good health!" Street Chief Guo said, "Not only must we remember it ourselves, but we must also tell our children and grandchildren to remember that the masses of the Third Street used the hard-earned money from their own struggle to help us with production and liberation. We must carefully distribute this money to every brother in difficulty, as a major capital for production, to become wealthy and never be poor again, and not to fail the good intentions of the brothers of the Third Street." After the conference ended in cheers and gongs and drums, public opinion said, "Now it is really true that all common people under heaven are one family! In the past, people said that counting [money] is like cutting off one's head [i.e., very painful], and that giving money is especially painful, but now giving money is really comfortable!"
    Furthermore, after the joint celebration of the Second and Third Streets, the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Streets in Wu'an held another joint celebration. The wealthier masses of the Sixth Street also gave 1.1 million yuan to the brothers in difficulty in the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Streets to help them carry out production and liberation.

　　翻身群众互济物资闹生产
    武安城各街举行联欢
    【本报长治讯】上月二十三日，武安城新二街与新三街群众举行盛大庆祝翻身联欢大会。新三街杜街长在雷动的掌声与欢呼声中，代表三街群众以五十六万元现款与物资一部赠给二街群众，他说：“三街群众叫我代表大家谢谢二街的兄弟们。过去我们受大恶霸地主霍老祥的压迫，一点不能抬头；二街的兄弟们耽误上自己的生活，自动来帮助我们斗争。今天我们彻底翻了身，清算回过去被敲诈的财产，我们生活已经很富裕，没有什么报答二街兄弟的，大家自动拿出这点钱和东西，让二街生活比较困难的兄弟们都能改善生活，有个生产的资本。”他的话音一落，马上民乐齐奏，万众欢呼：“天下平民是一家！有苦同受，有福同享！”郭街长代表二街群众，以“亲爱帮助翻身”的锦旗一面赠与杜街长，二街群众齐呼：“祝杜街长和大家都健康！”郭街长说：“不仅我们自己要记着，还要告诉我们的子孙后代都记着，三街群众拿自己斗争回来的血汗钱帮助我们生产翻身。我们要仔细的把这钱分配给每个困难的兄弟，做为生产大本钱，发家致富，永不受穷，不辜负三街兄弟们这片好意。”大会在欢呼与锣鼓声中结束后，群众舆论都说：“如今真是天下平民一家人啦！以前人说，数了割脑袋，就数出钱疼，可是现在出钱出得实在心顺哩！”
    又讯：武安继二、三街联欢之后，二、六、七、九各街又举行了一次联欢。较富裕的六街群众，也以一百一十万元赠与二、七、九街困难的兄弟，帮助进行生产翻身。（史洪）
