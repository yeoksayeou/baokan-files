　　Overthrow Traitorous Tyrants and Recover Land:
    Great Upsurge in the Mass Movement in Eastern Yuncheng, Enxian, and Xiajin;
    Distributing the Fruits, Paying Attention to Bottom-Up Equity, Many Villages Achieve "Land to the Tiller"
    [Report from Weixian by our correspondent] After the Turn-Over-Team entered Eastern Yuncheng, it conducted inspections based on the situation there, further emphasized boldness and freedom, and separately convened cadre meetings and activist meetings in several work areas of Enxian and Xiajin, organizing a rapid "great upsurge." After holding a meeting of more than two thousand people, the fourth and eighth districts of Xiajin, and most of the first, fifth, and sixth districts of Enxian, took action. In the past few days, we have heard good news from ten, eight, thirty, or twenty villages every day, and the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is extremely high. The cadres of the first district of Enxian and the eighth district of Xiajin have also spontaneously proposed to advance to the second district of Enxian and the area bordering Gaoping on the east bank of the Majia River. Thus, from Xiajin in the south to Enxian in the north, and from Jinqidian and Liangcun in the east to the border between Enxian and Wucheng in the west, covering eighty li in all directions, is full of cadres from the Turn-Over-Team. The masses everywhere are clamoring to settle accounts with the local bullies and landlords, running around asking for ways and listening to news. Whether on the streets or in the lanes, at the market or in the shops, men, women, old, and young are discussing the Turn-Over. The targets of the struggle include the big traitorous county magistrate Meng Yixuan, the black gang leader Lu Wanjie, the bandit leader Li Zhendong, some of the puppet Japanese and Wang Jingwei regime's village heads, and landlords and bullies who colluded with the enemy. Houses, grain, money, and land have been recovered. The method of distributing the fruits is to make it equitable from the bottom up, first taking care of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Many farmers have obtained land, with Sun Guai Village receiving six mu per person, Gao Zhuang and San Jiao Tang receiving four and a half mu per person, Sheng Zhuang receiving four mu per person, and Wen Xin Zhuang receiving three mu per person, among others. Villages that have already distributed the fruits are consolidating their organizations and holding "Think-Think Meetings" to conduct education. For example, after the "Think-Think Meeting," Ji Zhuang further conducted a "Heart-Touching Meeting." In the peasant Turn-Over movement, women also flocked into the struggle, vying to express their grievances and reasons. The Turn-Over women all participated in the Peasant Associations. To protect the fruits of victory, peasants have universally organized militias, and many villages have formed joint defense systems. In the fifth and sixth districts, they have jointly eliminated black gangs. (Ying Hua)
