　　【This newspaper, Yangcheng, 2nd dispatch】 It is reported that in the Wenxi-Xia County campaign, Hu Zongnan's troops, liberated by our brigade, included 700 soldiers from the 91st Regiment, 92nd Regiment of the 30th Division, the 4th Regiment, 5th Regiment, 232nd Regiment of the 78th Division, and the 1st Regiment, 49th Regiment of the 167th Division, from sergeant squad leader down. Ninety percent of them were tenant farmers, hired laborers, poor peasants, and small vendors, and five percent were middle school students. All were forced onto the civil war front under the threat of Chiang Kai-shek's bayonets. Since August 28th, they have been automatically holding anti-civil war grievance meetings in a certain location, continuing for a week. Yang Tianyi from Chenzhou, Henan, said, "The Kuomintang Baochang drafted me twice, forcing me to sell all my twenty mu of land. The third time, they tied me up and forced me into the army. My mother came crying to find me, but was beaten away by the company commander with a rifle butt..." Hu Dafa from Wen County said, "Last autumn, I got off the train at Wenxiang Town on the Longhai Railway and was stopped by several Central Army soldiers who said I was a 'bandit' and 'deserter,' robbed me of my ten thousand-odd yuan, and forced me into the army." Wu Haizhou from Shaanxi said, "I was caught in the division management area, and each time I was only given one steamed bun to eat. I was so hungry that I was skin and bones, and I was driven by the Kuomintang's whips to fight in the civil war." They were overwhelmed with anger during their accusations and held a solemn oath of revenge on the spot. They adopted a fighting program against Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and against the treacherous civil war. The 700 soldiers immediately and voluntarily requested to join the Eighth Route Army and go to the self-defense battlefield.
