Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. The Standing Committee of the CCP Northwest Central Bureau and the heads of various border region-level organs, in two meetings, listened to the report by Propaganda Minister Li Zhuoran on the past study of the Party Constitution in various organs and his opinions on future study. Xi Zhongxun, Xie Juezai, and others all believed that the main shortcomings in the past few months of Party Constitution study were the failure to closely link study with practice, detachment from the review of current cadre ideological tendencies, and the failure to combine it with work, resulting in some believing that study hindered work, or using the excuse of being busy to simply abandon study. Some were also affected in their learning enthusiasm because some practical problems raised were not properly resolved. The most important reason for all this is that some heads of organs themselves do not participate in study, nor do they care about or lead the study of their organs. Therefore, the meeting unanimously believed that with Chiang Kai-shek launching a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region also facing the threat of civil war, re-engaging in in-depth study of the Party Constitution, transforming cadre ideology, increasing work efficiency, and strengthening self-defense preparations are all urgent tasks for the entire Party. As for study methods, the first is to combine study with practice, and carry out review work from top to bottom (first of all, the top), reflect on ideology, and the leadership should boldly promote democracy so that everyone can speak out. All problems raised by cadres in the study that the study group cannot solve can be submitted with their own opinions to the superior level, and then to the Standing Committee of the Northwest Bureau for handling. Disciplinary action will be taken for violations of discipline. The meeting also determined, based on current work and cadre ideological issues, that in studying the Party Constitution, it should be linked to studying the Central Committee's decision on strengthening Party spirit, Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism", the "mass line" part of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the Party Constitution, and Comrade Gao Gang's report on work style issues. Secondly, the heads of each organ must set an example themselves. The Standing Committee of the Northwest Bureau has specially instructed Party committees and Party groups at all levels to personally lead cadre study and lead cadre work as equally important tasks. Finally, the meeting decided that various Yan'an border region-level organs should, in the near future, convene a study mobilization meeting based on the problems existing in their own organs.

　　中共西北局检查各机关党章学习
    目前应经过学习加强自卫思想准备
    【新华社延安廿九日电】中共西北中央局常委会与边区级各机关首长会议，在两次会议上，听取宣传部长李卓然关于过去各机关党章学习情况的报告及对今后学习的意见后，习仲勋谢觉哉等均认为在过去数月的党章学习中，存在的主要缺点是学习未能与实际密切联系，脱离对目前干部思想倾向的检讨，没有和工作结合，致有认为学习妨碍业务，或者借口工作忙，干脆放弃学习。有的则因提出了一些实际问题没有得到适当解决，以致影响学习情绪。造成这一切的最主要的原因是某些机关首长自己不参加学习，也不关心不领导机关学习，因此会议一致认为目前蒋介石大举向解放区进攻，陕甘宁边区也正处在内战威胁局面下，重新深入学习党章，改造干部思想，增进工作效能，加强自卫准备，实为当前全党急务。至于学习方法，首先是使学习与实际结合起来，由上（首先是上）而下的进行检讨工作，反省思想，领导上大胆的发扬民主，使大家有话都讲出来。干部在学习中提出的一切问题，学习小组不能解决的，可以提出自己的意见，提交上级，交到西北局常委会处理。对于违反纪律的事件，将给予纪律的处分。会议并依据目前工作与干部思想问题确定在学习党章中，联系学习中央关于增强党性决定，毛主席的“反对自由主义”、刘少奇同志党章报告中的“群众路线”部分，及高岗同志关于作风问题的报告。其次就是各机关首长自己要以身作则，西北局常委会特责成各级党委与党组应亲自领导干部学习与领导干部工作为其同等重要的任务。最后会议决定延安边区级各机关应于最近根据本机关存在的问题，召开一次学习动员大会。
