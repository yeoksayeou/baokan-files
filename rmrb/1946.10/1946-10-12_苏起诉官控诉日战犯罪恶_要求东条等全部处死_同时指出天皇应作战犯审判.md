Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Tokyo dispatch: Soviet Prosecutor Golunsky, at the opening of the Far East International Tribunal on the 7th, accused Tojo and the other 27 war criminals of grave crimes, demanding that all be sentenced to the most severe penalty, and also pointed out that the Emperor should be tried as a war criminal. He said, "The chairman of the major military and political leaders' meeting on July 2, 1941, was the Emperor himself, and that meeting decided to attack the Soviet Union under the guise of negotiations." Golunsky continued to recount the history of Japanese imperialist aggression, saying, "The Pearl Harbor incident was the same trick Japan used to launch a surprise attack on Port Arthur." Golunsky cited facts, pointing out that the Soviet Red Army's defeat of Hitler foiled all of Japan's plots to expand its aggression in the Far East. Documents seized from the Japanese warlords prove that the Japanese imperial government did not realize that defeat was inevitable until the Red Army attacked the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria. As Golunsky read the indictment, the American and Japanese defense attorneys of the Japanese war criminals attempted to collude and disrupt the reading. These defense attorneys said, "The Soviet indictment is too long and should be revised; the preface should not exceed three to five pages." After Golunsky sternly refuted this, Presiding Judge Webb also stood up to stop the war criminals' defense attorneys from making unreasonable demands and asked Golunsky to continue speaking.

　　苏起诉官控诉日战犯罪恶
    要求东条等全部处死
    同时指出天皇应作战犯审判
    【新华社延安九日电】东京讯：苏联起诉官哥伦斯基，于七日远东国际法庭开庭时控诉东条等二十七名战犯全部有重大罪恶，要求均应处以极刑，并且指出天皇应作战犯审判。他说：“一九四一年七月二日主要军政领袖会议的主席便是天皇，该会决定在谈判掩盖下进攻苏联。”哥氏继述日本帝国主义侵略历史说：“珍珠港事变是日本偷袭旅顺港之役的故技。”哥氏举列事实，指出苏联红军击溃希特勒使日本在远东扩大侵略的一切阴谋归于夭折。缴获之日本军阀的文件，证明直到红军在满洲里进攻日本关东军时，日本帝国政府才知道失败已成定局。当哥氏朗读起诉书时，日本战犯的美籍与日籍辩护人企图联合捣蛋，阻止哥氏朗读，这些辩护人说：“苏联起诉书太长，应重新修改，序言不超过三至五页。”当经哥氏严词驳斥，主审官魏希也起立制止战犯辩护人无理取闹，并请哥氏继续发言。
