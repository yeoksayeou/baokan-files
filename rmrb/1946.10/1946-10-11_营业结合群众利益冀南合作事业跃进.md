　　(This newspaper's Southern Hebei dispatch on the 9th) Because it has achieved integration with the interests of the masses, cooperative businesses in Southern Hebei have developed unprecedentedly. The Dazhong Cooperative in Jize County enjoys the highest prestige among the masses and has experienced the fastest development. The cooperative's businesses include a sauce garden, towel weaving, general merchandise, a restaurant, and an oil mill. In three months, it has earned a total profit of over 1.39 million yuan, with a net profit of 30% per share. Influenced by this, the masses have been enthusiastically buying shares. Currently, the number of central cooperatives in various districts has expanded to thirteen, among which the Wu Guanying, Xingdi, and Xiaozhaizhen central cooperatives are the most active. The Wu Guanying cooperative started with less than 10,000 yuan in capital, but through three months of effort, it has expanded to 130,000 yuan. The Dazhong Cooperative helps organize women's spinning and weaving, provides loans of cotton yarn to poor women, and helps them sell cloth. The women are very supportive. Secondly, it provides goods on credit to support poor urban peddlers in production. Currently, 23 poor peddlers in the county seat have solved the problem of lacking capital. With the help of the Dazhong Cooperative, the handicraft industry and commerce in the city have also developed greatly. One hundred and two households, with 385 people, have started businesses with its support. In order to further develop and prosper the market, the cooperative has decided to assign its capable cadres to various central cooperatives to provide practical leadership, help solve difficulties, and create experience. From mid-April to July 1, the Guantao Merchants' Cooperative earned a net profit of over 226,000 yuan in two and a half months, with each share earning 60%. After this settlement, the number of shares doubled. The cooperative has decided to vigorously support poor merchants and small handicraft workers in developing production in the future. Furthermore, the Lihua Cooperative in Linqing City, which was established by more than 600 workers and shop apprentices after increasing their capital and pooling shares, has earned a profit of over 1 million yuan in the three months from May to August.
