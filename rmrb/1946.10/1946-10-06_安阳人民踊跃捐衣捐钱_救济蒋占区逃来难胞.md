Changzhi, October 3rd (Our Newspaper) - The autumn wind is already cool. The people of Anyang are enthusiastically donating clothes and money to relieve the refugees who have fled from the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas of Qugou, Xiahan, and other places. An Guxiang, a cadre of the Fucheng Village Farmers' Association, upon hearing about the relief effort, immediately took out his cotton clothes for the winter. The primary school students all went home to mobilize their families to donate their clothes to the children who had no clothes to wear. The village donated 414 pieces of various clothing items, 20 jin of old cotton, and over 30,000 Jichaos in one day. The Sixth District Office has received more than 1,600 pieces of clothing, 253 hats, shoes, socks, etc., more than 64,000 Jichaos, and more than 4,000 jin of old cotton. The District Office also allocated 5,000 jin of public grain for relief. Donations are still continuing in districts and villages throughout the county. The masses said: "As long as our people are united, are we still afraid of defeating Chiang Kai-shek?"
