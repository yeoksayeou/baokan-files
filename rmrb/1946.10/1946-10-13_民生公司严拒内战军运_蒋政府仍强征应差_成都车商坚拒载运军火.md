　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai Dispatch: Minsheng Company firmly refused military transport in mid-September. The company expressed to the Shanghai Office of the Logistics Department of the Chiang government that it had no intention of assisting in the civil war, and that if ships were requisitioned again, they would refuse to comply. The Nanjing Logistics Department even sent a letter of questioning, with a tone suggesting the imposition of a political label. However, the company's attitude was extremely firm and received widespread sympathy from democratic figures, the press, and the business community here. According to the company's repeated complaints to society, the Chiang government's military transport has requisitioned nine out of ten of the company's ships, resulting in unbearable losses. Recently, the company spent tens of millions of yuan to repair several landing craft, but they were forcibly conscripted for service as soon as they left the dock. Coupled with the threat of superior capital from the Song-affiliated "state-run" China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company and other private shipping companies are on the verge of collapse. Another report: Chengdu commercial vehicles have also recently been forcibly requisitioned, arousing fierce opposition from car dealers throughout the city. A few days ago, the Chiang government ordered two hundred vehicles from Chengdu to transport ammunition to the Hanzhong area. When the ammunition was loaded onto the vehicles, the car dealers immediately unloaded it all and refused to transport it.

    蒋政府仍强征应差
    成都车商坚拒载运军火
    【新华社延安九日电】沪汛：民生公司于上月中旬严拒军运，该公司向蒋政府后勤部上海办事处表示无意帮助内战，嗣后船只如果再被拉差，必将拒绝应征。南京后勤部对此竟去函质问，语气之间，颇有压上一顶红帽子之意。但该公司态度极为坚决，并获得此间民主人士舆论界及工商界的广大同情。据该公司一再向社会控诉，蒋政府的军运使该公司的船只被征十之九，亏累不堪。最近该公司花几千万元修理好几只登陆艇，一出坞就被强征应差。加上宋系的“国营”招商局以优势资本威胁，该公司及其他民营轮航公司已濒崩溃的险境。另息：成都商营汽车最近亦被强迫征调，激起全市车商的猛烈反对。日前蒋政府勒令二百辆车商由蓉赶运军火赴汉中一带，当弹药装上汽车时，车商立即将其全部卸下，拒绝载运。
