　　Japan Socialist Party Holds National Congress
    Left-Right Struggle Unprecedentedly Fierce
    Xinhua News Agency: The Japan Socialist Party held its national congress from the 28th to the 30th of last month. The struggle between the left and right factions was unprecedentedly fierce during the meeting. On the opening day of the congress, the two factions were deadlocked when drafting the new party platform because their proposals were vastly different. After three hours of debate, the meeting was adjourned for one hour. Moderates leaders such as Nagao Mizutani mediated and compromised the opinions of both sides, and finally passed the new party platform as follows: (1) Advocate that the House of Representatives adopt a representative system and lower the voting age to 18. (2) Liquidate wartime public debt and confiscate wartime profits. (3) Implement the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, eliminate militarism and Nazi bureaucracy in all classes, and prevent the resurgence of such tendencies. (4) Support global disarmament. (5) Nationalize all important industries, including the steel industry, coal mines, chemical fertilizers, power industry, and ocean shipping. (6) Establish a Ministry of Labor and Fisheries, implement a 48-hour work week (36 hours for miners), guarantee workers' right to strike, and guarantee minimum prices for agricultural products. (7) Socialize banking, trust, insurance, and film businesses. (8) Implement democratic education and advocate equal rights for men and women. On the 29th, when discussing the Japanese Communist Party's proposal to establish a united front between the two parties, there were calls and beatings, and the fighting lasted for an hour. Ultimately, it was rejected because the right wing was still in the majority. On the 30th, the election of the Central Executive Committee almost turned into an armed conflict between the left and right factions. As a result of the election, right-wing leader Suehiro Nishio took the important position of Secretary-General, while former Secretary-General Tetsu Katayama became Chairman of the Executive Committee.

　　日本社会党开全代大会
    左右派斗争空前激烈
    新华社讯：日本社会党于上月二十八日至三十日举行全国代表大会，会中左派与右派斗争空前激烈。大会开幕之日，两派在制订新党纲时即相持不下，因双方提案距离甚远。于争论三小时后，曾休会一小时，由水谷长也郎等中派领袖从中斡旋，折衷双方意见，始最后通过新党纲如下：（１）主张众议院采取代表制，降低选举年龄至十八岁。（２）清算战时公债，没收战时利润。（３）履行波茨顿宣言之条款，并清除各阶层之黩武主义和纳粹主义官僚政治，以及防止此种倾向之复活。（４）支持世界性之废除军备。（５）一切重要工业包括钢铁工业煤矿化学肥料动力工业海洋航运之国营。（６）成立劳工渔业省，实施一周四十八小时工作制（矿工则三十六小时），保障工人罢工，保证农产品之最低价格。（７）银行信托保险及电影事业之社会主义化。（８）实施民主教育，主张男女一律平等。二十九日讨论日共建议成立两党统一战线时，曾发生呼吁殴打行为，对打达一小时之久。终因右派尚处于优势，而遭否决。三十日，为选举中央执行委员，左右两派又几演成武力冲突。选举结果，右派领袖西尾末广立居总书记要位，前总书记片山哲则为执行委员会主席。
