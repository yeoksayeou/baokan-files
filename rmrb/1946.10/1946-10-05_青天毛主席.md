　　Chairman Mao, the Upright Official
    Li Zhengui
    In the threshing ground in the northwest corner outside Handan City, a circle of people were sitting. There were staff members wearing straw hats and military uniforms, old farmers with graying hair, and old toothless ladies. Each of them was holding a knife and busy cutting ears of grain. Everyone was busy with their hands and mouths. Several working comrades were explaining the victory news from the front lines to the old men, and several old ladies were telling their innermost thoughts.
    An old lady pursed her toothless mouth and said to me: "My old woman has three unforgettable memories: The first is unforgettable the puppet army platoon leader who lived on the North Gate, beating people, scolding people, and eating things without paying. These are all small things. One night, he ordered my door to be opened and searched more than fifteen times. At that time, two yuan could buy one dou of millet, and he robbed my family of seventy yuan, equivalent to three shi and five dou of millet. The whole family cried to death and had to go hungry. But, when the son of a bitch was withdrawing, a bullet fired from the city hit my nephew. I will never forget these Japanese traitorous dogs.
    The second unforgettable memory is of the Eighth Route Army. An Eighth Route Army company commander, knowing that my nephew was wounded by the puppet army, immediately found their doctor to give my nephew injections and medicine, without asking for a single penny. I had no way to repay the kindness of the Eighth Route Army comrades, so I took the two boxes of cigarettes that the puppet army hadn't robbed and gave them to the company commander to smoke. The company commander refused to accept them, no matter what. We couldn't think of any other way, so we shed tears of gratitude and kowtowed to the company commander. The company commander also shed tears and helped us up. He said to us: "The Eighth Route Army is the people's army, eliminating harm for the elders, avenging the elders, and treating the elders' wounds. This is our duty. Your enemies are our enemies. We are one family, so don't be polite." Comrade! How can I forget this? Furthermore, let me talk about you comrades: helping us with the summer harvest and also helping us with the autumn harvest. You are the best army that can't be found anywhere in the world.
    Ah! My old woman will never forget Chairman Mao, the great benefactor, even in death! His world is the world our old folks want to live in. In the past, we suffered from the bullying of the rich and powerful. We had mouths but dared not speak. We had no place to appeal our grievances, and no place to avenge our hatred. Now! We have turned over! We have food, clothing, and shelter. We have mouths to speak, and we are no longer bullied by them. Oh! I never thought that my old woman could live a few more years in Chairman Mao's good world!
    We, the common people, can see clearly. The Japanese and the puppet army are the ones who don't let us live. Now it's Old Chiang, this rice bucket faction again (reactionary faction). We can see clearly that the Japanese and the puppet army were driven away by the Eighth Route Army. If the American rice bucket faction dares to help Old Chiang's rice bucket faction attack us, my old woman will risk her life to fight.
    I will never forget the harmful puppet army, never forget the life-saving Eighth Route Army, and I will never forget Chairman Mao, the great benefactor, the Upright Official. Because of him, we turned over."

　　青天毛主席
    李珍贵
    在邯郸城外西北角的谷场上，坐着一圈人，有戴着草帽，穿着军衣的工作人员，有苍白了头发的老农民，有掉了牙齿的老太太，一个个拿着刀，在忙着切谷穗，大家手忙嘴也不闲，有几个工作同志在给老汉们讲解前线胜利消息，好几个老太太在诉说她们的心里话。
    有一个老太太抿了一下缺牙的嘴向我说：“我老婆有三不忘：头一个忘不了北门上住的皇协军排长，打人、骂人、吃东西不给钱，这都算小事。有一天夜里，他叫开我的门搜寻过十五次，那时两块钱买一斗小米，他抢走我家七十块钱，合三石五斗米，全家哭死哭活，只好饿着肚子。可是，狗杂种临退走时，从城里打出来的子弹，又打在我侄儿的身上，我死也忘不了这些日本汉奸狗东西。
    第二个忘不了八路军，八路军一个连长，知道我侄儿被伪军打伤了，立即就找来他们的医生，给我侄儿打针、上药，一个钱也不要，我没有法子报答八路同志的好心，就把伪军没抢走的两盒烟，拿来给连长吸，连长同志说什么也不收，我们再也想不出办法，只好流出了感恩的眼泪，向连长磕头，连长同志也流着泪把我们扶起来，他对我们说：“八路军是老百姓的队伍，为父老们除害，为父老们报仇，给父老们医治伤口，这是我们应尽的责任，你们的仇人，就是我们的仇人，一家人，不要客气。”同志！你说我怎么能忘了呢？再说道同志们吧：帮助我们收夏，又帮助我们收秋，你们是普天下再找不出来的好队伍。
    啊！我老婆就是死也忘不了青天大恩人毛主席！他的世道，就是咱们老百姓想走的世道，过去咱受有钱有势人的欺负，有嘴不敢说话，不冤无处去诉，有仇无处去报。现在！咱们翻身啦，有吃、有穿、有住，有嘴能说话，再也不受他们的欺负啦。哎呀！想不到我老婆还能过几年老毛的好世道呢！
    咱们老百姓眼睛看得清楚，不让我们活命的是日本、皇协军，现在又是老蒋这个饭桶派啦（反动派），我们看得清，日本、皇协军，是八路把他们打走的，美国饭桶派，敢帮助老蒋饭桶派，向我们进攻，我老婆拚了老命也得干。
    我忘不了害人的皇协军，忘不了救命的八路军我更忘不了青天大恩人毛泽东，有了他，我们才翻了身。
