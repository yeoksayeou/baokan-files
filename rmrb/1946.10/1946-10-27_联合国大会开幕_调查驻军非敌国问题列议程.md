　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 24th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held its opening ceremony here on the 23rd at 4:00 PM (New York time). Assembly President Spaak delivered the opening address. New York City Council President Impellitteri and U.S. President Truman successively gave speeches. Truman pointed out that "The United Nations, by its very nature, is not intended to solve the various problems directly caused by the war. The role of the United Nations is to provide a method for maintaining future international peace after all issues are resolved fairly." When referring to the possibility of another world war being discussed by the general public and the fears of some people, Truman believed that "there is no basis" for it. After Truman's speech, the General Assembly adjourned and reconvened at 6:00 PM on the 24th.

The meeting was held at the new United Nations General Assembly site, Lake Success, located in a lush park that was formerly the site of the New York World's Fair. The matters decided by the General Committee are as follows: (1) The General Assembly should convene on Saturday afternoons if possible.

(3) Only the Secretary-General Lie's report can be presented orally. (4) The General Assembly should proceed with discussing the first item on the agenda on the 24th. A US spokesman said: the General Committee had no differences of opinion during the discussion. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky attended the General Committee meeting. Vyshinsky stated in his speech: the Soviet Union opposes South Africa's demand to merge any of South Africa's territories, he said: "This matter should not even be placed on the agenda, it is contrary to the spirit of the Charter." At the same time, he also said: The Soviet Union will also oppose the proposals of Australia and Cuba to amend the United Nations Charter regarding the provisions on veto power.

The provisional rules of procedure of the United Nations General Assembly include 53 issues, divided into six categories: (1) Political issues, among which the investigation of the stationing of troops by Allied countries in non-enemy countries proposed by the Soviet Union is the most important.
