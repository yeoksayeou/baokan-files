　　Defend the People's City!
    Zhangjiakou People Rally and Pledge
    Huaihai District Launches a Torrent of Participation in the War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 28th] In enthusiastic response to the call of the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau to defend the people's city of Zhangjiakou, 170,000 citizens of the city rallied. On the afternoon of the 23rd, more than 7,000 workers and citizens from the Second District stood in the rain, listening attentively to Mayor Yang Chunpu's report on various measures to defend Zhangjiakou. The crowd repeatedly erupted with slogans such as "Zhangjiakou will always belong to the people!" and "Let Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops be buried in the flames of the people's self-defense war!" The peasants in the Eighth District who had been emancipated through land reform, carrying bright red-tasseled spears, went on stage to swear: "We must remember that if Chiang Kai-shek occupies Zhangjiakou, not only will we not be able to cultivate the land that was returned to us, but we will also lose our freedom as human beings. Let's all resolve to fight these fascist traitors to the end!" When the Third and Sixth Districts held their rallies, more than 10,000 elderly women came to participate, supported by their children and grandchildren. Gentleman Councilor Meng Jianquan appealed, saying: "If Chiang Kai-shek comes, America will also come. If we don't become slaves to Chiang Kai-shek, we will become slaves to America, losing our country. Only by uniting as one and defeating Chiang Kai-shek's offensive will the common people have a way to survive." More than 800 workers and friends from the Minsheng Electric Power Company, the Northwest Printing Factory, and other units held a mobilization meeting for the self-defense war at the People's Theater, unanimously demanding the establishment of a Zhangjiakou Workers' Detachment to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army in annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops. Electrical workers Shan Liangcai and Wu Yusheng and others signed up for the army on the spot, and resolutely stated: "In order to survive, we must never let Chiang Kai-shek come and oppress us workers again." The Zhangjiakou Labor Comfort Committee recently received donations to be forwarded to the Eighth Route Army soldiers defending the Ping-Sui Railway line. These include more than 22,000 dozens of soap bars, 1,280 dozens of toothbrushes, more than 15,800 bottles of toothpaste and tooth powder, 40 large bags of white sugar, 307 kilograms of sesame oil, 300 jin of pickles, 200 cans of milk, and other comfort packages.
