　　Saluting Combat Heroes and Discipline Models
　　Since the Self-Defense War, many combat heroes and models have emerged from our district's various military units. For example, in the Battle of Tashan, two of our platoons defeated a regiment of invading Hu forces; in Changliuzhai, the Third Battalion repelled seven fierce attacks by Chiang's troops; and in the battles of Lanfeng and Qixian, the combat and discipline models of units 6016, 6018, 6046, 6047, 6048, and 6054 have won praise throughout the army and have been commended by their superiors. After the liberation of Hongzhao on the Tongpu Line, our army's excellent discipline was even praised by a Spanish missionary who said our army was "brave and good at fighting, without violating the slightest thing." When we sent people to investigate the losses of the masses, the masses said, "They didn't even enter the houses, how could there be any losses? The Eighth Route Army is really wonderful!" Examples like these are too numerous to mention. These heroic and exemplary actions not only add glory to the entire army, but are also the supreme glory of the people in the liberated areas! While admiring them, we pay our highest respect!
　　The reason why our army can continuously produce heroes and models is: First, our army is the people's army. It is produced and strengthened on the basis of the people's conscious awakening and improvement in the liberated areas. It has a deep flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses. It is endowed with the heroic, tenacious, and ingenious qualities of the people seeking liberation, and it is often nurtured by the masses. Therefore, it can bravely kill the enemy and cherish the people. This is completely different from Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army, which is forced and coerced through coercion and inducement to attack the people. This unique and excellent quality of our army is the source of heroes and models, and an important guarantee for crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Second, our army has many brave, firm, and excellent Party and non-Party cadres who not only overcome difficulties themselves to complete the Party's tasks and play an exemplary role, but are also good at coming from the masses, going to the masses, leading the troops, improving the troops, and promoting everyone to advance together.
　　At present, the scale of the civil war has reached an unprecedented level. Although Chiang's troops have suffered heavy losses in their attacks on the liberated areas, since the traitorous ringleader Chiang Kai-shek openly declared war on the people, he will definitely launch even more frantic attacks, and arduous battles are still ahead of us. We call on all commanders and fighters of our army to further develop the heroic nature of the people's soldiers, learn from our old heroes and models, and launch a new heroism competition this year; at the same time, we hope that our heroes and models will not be arrogant or slack, always maintain their existing honor, and maintain close contact with the masses to promote everyone to advance together. In this way, we will create more combat heroes and discipline models, and we will win greater and more victories.

　　向战斗英雄守纪模范致敬
    自卫战争以来，我区各线部队涌现了许多战斗英雄与模范，如塔儿山我军两个班击溃进犯胡军一团，常刘寨三营击退蒋军七次猛攻以及兰封、杞县战斗中，六○一六、六○一八、六○四六、六○四七、六○四八、六○五四等部队的战斗模范与守纪模范事绩，已博全军称誉且获首长嘉奖。在同蒲线解放洪赵之后，我军良好纪律，连西班牙籍牧师亦称赞我军“英勇善战秋毫无犯”，当我派员调查群众损失时，群众说：“房都没进，还会有损失，八路军真是美的美呢！”像以上范例，更是举不胜举。这些英雄与模范行动，不仅为全军增辉，亦是解放区人民的无上光荣！我们钦佩之余，谨致崇高的敬意！
    我军之所以能够不断涌现英雄与模范，是由于：第一、我们的军队是人民的军队，它是在解放区人民觉悟空前提高的基础上产生与壮大起来的，它与群众有深厚的血肉关系，它赋有人民求解放的英勇、顽强、机智的优良品质，而又经常获得人民群众培养。所以能够英勇杀敌爱护人民，这与蒋介石威迫利诱强征硬抓而来的进攻人民的反动军队完全不同。我军这种得天独厚的优良品质，乃英雄与模范生产的泉源，亦粉碎蒋介石进攻的重要保证。第二是我军有许多勇敢坚定优秀的党与非党干部，他们不仅自己能克服困难完成党的任务起模范作用，而且善于从群众中来到群众中去领导部队提高部队推动大家一齐前进。
    目前内战规模已达空前地步，虽蒋军进攻解放区迭遭重创。但自卖国贼头子蒋介石公开向人民宣战后，必将作更疯狂的进攻，艰巨的战斗还在我们前面。我们号召我军全体指战员，更加发挥人民子弟兵的英雄本色，向我们的老英雄与模范学习，在今年里展开新英雄主义竞赛；同时希望我们的英雄与模范，勿骄勿懈，永远保持已有的荣誉，并密切与群众联系，推动大家一齐前进，这样我们就会创造出更多的战斗英雄与守纪模范来，就会获得更大更多的胜利。
