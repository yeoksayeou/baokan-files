　　Review of the Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region's September Mass Movement

　　Since the regional Party committee, administrative office, and military region issued the call to fully support the peasants' emancipation, various localities have successively dispatched large numbers of cadres to organize emancipation teams. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas. In order to realize "land to the tiller" as soon as possible and ensure the victory of the self-defense war, many regions quickly broke out of their narrow confines and opened up the situation. A total of more than 400,000 people in over 1,200 villages poured into the struggle. In Ningnan alone, 56 villages with more than 30,000 people were involved in the movement in seven or eight days. The Xia En sand region developed rapidly from points to areas, and by the end of August, 44 villages were in the midst of the movement. Many regions, such as more than 50 villages in Handan, Yongzhi Tianzhuang and other villages, Feixiang Tiantaishan, and Ningnan Dongwang and other villages, have achieved "land to the tiller" through anti-traitor liquidation and reasonable distribution of recovered land using the "average compensation" method. Mass organizations have been expanded in the movement. These achievements enlighten us that, according to the demands of the masses, bold action and letting go will lead to rapid development of the movement. The example of Xia En further proves this point. Initially, due to excessive emphasis on investigation and research before the large-scale movement, no results were achieved in a month. Later, emphasis was placed on bold action and handling matters according to the masses' own opinions, and several villages were stirred up every day within ten days. In the future, we should continue to promote the spirit of supporting the masses from top to bottom, always act according to the opinions of the masses, and at the same time, carry out in-depth work after the storm-like large-scale movement has passed, in order to achieve the goal of organizing the majority.

　　The government's participation in the mass movement has also been done well in this period. The district government cadres of Wuxun County clarified the idea of fully supporting the masses' emancipation and actively participated in the mass movement. The county magistrate personally led section chiefs and staff members to the countryside, and judicial work used the mass line method to resolve cases in the mass movement. Their participation in the mass movement gave the masses great encouragement. Seeing that the government was supporting and making decisions for them, they dared to act boldly. Government cadres were initially worried about affecting departmental work, but later gradually realized that departmental work would be better completed after the masses were mobilized. The Yongzhi government also created some achievements in participating in the mass movement. These two counties solved the following problems in the movement:

　　(1) Solved the ideological obstacles of cadres—not being bound by legal provisions, boldly making decisions for the masses, and approving the reasonable demands of the masses.

　　(2) In order to complete the central task of mobilizing the masses, departmental work should revolve around and be subordinate to this central task, overcoming the past tendency to emphasize system work. In addition to drawing cadres from various departments to directly mobilize the masses, the judicial department focused on handling mass movement cases and approving farmers' demands. The public security department focused on anti-spying, suppressing die-hard traitors, and striving for the repentance of puppet personnel. The education department inspired primary school teachers and students to combine teaching with the mass movement and used this to evaluate their achievements. In the completion of departmental work, a centralized leadership "package" method was created, with mutual care and responsibility, and mutual reporting at large meetings to implement centralized leadership. As a result, work morale and efficiency were greatly improved.

　　Following the righteous act of Yang Zhihan, speaker of the Chicken Ze County assembly, in dedicating land, Party members, military cadres, government cadres, enlightened gentry, and dependents of martyrs all dedicated land to support the realization of "land to the tiller," allowing farmers who had suffered for thousands of years to stand up. The total amount of land dedicated has now reached over a thousand mu. The farmers who received the land praised with emotion: "Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can there be such cadres." The Ninth Sub-district (formerly the Third Sub-district) has carried out the land dedication campaign relatively well. Following Speaker Yang, Han Yinting, commander of the Independent Regiment, Secretary Liu of the sub-district administration, Mr. Ke Xia of Chengci, Mr. Jiao Weiran, an enlightened gentry from Handan, Secretary Liu of the Weixian County government, Section Chief Wang, and others voluntarily dedicated land.

　　In addition, the mutual competition among emancipation team cadres has also greatly promoted the work. Before the departure of the administrative office-level emancipation teams, they challenged each other to create models for leading emancipation. The Fourth Prefectural Committee and counties such as Baixiang and Ningnan also set out reward conditions to reward models of the mass movement. The Yongzhi Yaolou community also launched a competition movement between villages and groups. Within five days, nine of the twelve villages in the entire community turned to struggle. The rapid development of the movement and the creation of great achievements in counties such as Ningnan and Xiazhen are also inseparable from this. The conditions for the competition were democratically discussed and mostly emphasized contacting the masses, standing firm, acting boldly, supporting the masses, achieving significant results in implementing policies, following the mass line, and adopting a democratic style, etc. The emancipation teams further emphasized close integration with local cadres and humbly learning from them. This greatly promoted revolutionary heroism and advanced the movement. However, at present, this movement is still limited to the emancipation teams and county and district cadres, and it is even more necessary to carry out this movement among village cadres and activists. The leadership should clearly put forward the following conditions to encourage their progress: 1. Closely contact the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and do not bow to threats or inducements. 2. Think of more ways in organizing the masses to speak out about their grievances and carry out liquidation struggles. 3. Be able to fairly and reasonably distribute the fruits of victory, so that everyone has land to cultivate and food to eat. 4. Constantly influence other activists to continuously progress, etc. Let them serve the masses through mutual competition and mutual supervision, so that the work can take root and will not be affected by the withdrawal of cadres.

　　冀南九月群运回顾
    自区党委、行署、军区发出全力支持农民翻身的号召以后，各地即陆续抽调了大批干部组织翻身队出发，此时正值蒋介石向我解放区发动大规模进攻，为尽早实现耕者有其田，以保证自卫战争的胜利，许多地区迅速跳出狭小的圈子打开了局面。先后共有一千二百余村四十多万人涌入斗争。只宁南在七、八天内即有五十六村三万余人卷入运动。夏恩沙区由点向面迅速发展，至八月底已有四十四村在运动中。许多地区如邯郸五十余村，永智田庄等村，肥乡天台山，宁南东汪等村经过反奸清算，采用“平均补齐”的办法合理的分配收回的土地已实现了耕者有其田，群众组织都在运动中扩大了。这些成绩启示我们，根据群众要求，大胆放手，运动就会迅速开展，夏恩的例子更证明了这一点，该地起初因过分强调了大运动前的调查研究，一月未搞出成绩，后来强调大胆放手，照群众自己的意见办事，十几天内每天都有几个村子轰动起来，今后应继续发扬自上而下为群众撑腰的精神，时时按照群众意见去做，同时还要在暴风雨似的大运动过去之后进行深入工作，以达到组织大多数的目的。
    政府参加群运这一段做的也较好，武训县区政权干部明确了全力支援群众翻身的思想，纷纷参加群运。县长亲自带领科长科员下乡，司法工作即用群众路线方法解决群运中的案件。他们的参加群运，给了群众很大鼓舞，他们看到有政府给撑腰作主，就大胆的干起来。政府干部最初还担心影响部门工作，后来逐渐认识群众发动起来后部门工作会更好完成。永智政府在参加群运上也创造了一些成绩，这两个县在运动中解决了下面几个问题：
    （一）解决了干部思想上的障碍——不受法律条文的束缚，大胆为群众作主，批准群众合理的要求。
    （二）为完成发动群众的中心任务，部门工作应围绕和服从这一中心工作，克服了过去强调系统工作的偏向，除各部门抽调干部直接发动群众外，司法部门则以处理群运案件，批准农民要求为主。公安部门则以反特务，镇压死心汉奸及争取伪员悔过为主。教育部门则启发小学师生结合群运教学，并以之评定其成绩。在部门工作的完成上创造了集中领导的“一揽子”方式，互相照顾，彼此负责，开大会时互作汇报，实行集中领导，结果工作情绪及效率大为提高。
    献田运动继鸡泽杨直韩议长献田义举之后，党员、军队干部、政府干部、开明士绅、烈属地主均纷纷献田，赞助耕者有其田的实现，使几千年来受尽痛苦的农民翻身。现献田总数已达千亩以上。接受田地的农民皆感动地称赞说：“只有在毛主席领导下才有这样的干部。”献田以九分区（原三分区）开展较好，继杨议长之后，有独立团韩荫亭团长、分政刘秘书、成磁马克孝先生、邯郸开明士绅焦蔚然先生、魏县政府刘秘书、王科长等自动献田。
    另外翻身队干部开展了相互竞赛，对工作的推动作用也很大。行署级翻身队出发前，曾互相挑战，要创造领导翻身的模范，四地委及柏乡宁南等县，并定出奖励条件，以奖励群运模范，永智姚楼小区也开展了村与村组与组的竞赛运动。五天内全小区十二个村中九个村转入斗争。宁南夏津等县运动迅速开展且创造很大成绩，也是与此分不开的。竞赛条件是经民主讨论产生的多是强调联系群众，站稳立场，大胆放手、为群众撑腰，实现政策作出显著成绩，走群众路线、民主作风等等。翻身队中更强调了密切结合当地干部，虚心向其学习等。这样大大发扬了革命英雄主义，推进了运动。但目前这一运动还只限于翻身队和县区干部之间，而在村干部、积极分子中开展这一运动更是必要，领导上应明确提出以下条件鼓励他们进步：一、密切联系群众，倾听群众意见，不为威胁利诱而低头。二、在组织群众诉苦清算斗争中，多想办法。三、能公平合理的分配果实，达到人人有地种有饭吃。四、经常影响其他积极分子不断进步等等。让他们互相竞赛、互相监督的为群众服务，这样才能使工作生根，而不致因干部抽走受到影响。（新华社冀南分社）
