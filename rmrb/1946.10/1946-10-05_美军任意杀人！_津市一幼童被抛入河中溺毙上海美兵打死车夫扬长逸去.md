Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: News from Beiping: Atrocities by U.S. troops in Pingjin are increasing daily. In September alone, there were four cases of U.S. troops committing murder, including the shooting and wounding of student Cao Guiming by U.S. military police in Ping on the 5th, the shooting and killing of farmer Ren Yizhuang by U.S. troops in Ping on the 14th, the shooting and killing of farmer He Wanyu by U.S. troops in Tianjin on the 6th, and the drowning of an eleven-year-old child, Hu Xiaomei, after being thrown into the river by U.S. soldiers in the city on the 22nd. Regarding traffic accidents caused by U.S. military vehicles, incomplete reports indicate as many as nine incidents. In Beiping, on the 13th, a U.S. jeep damaged a Jin Cheng Motor Company car. On the 16th, a U.S. military truck driven by Ouner Wende killed rickshaw puller Gao Shidi, and an elderly woman in the vehicle was also seriously injured. On the 19th, a U.S. truck from the military mediation department injured businessman Zhang Qingfeng. In Tianjin, on the 4th, U.S. vehicle number 62862 injured cyclist Yang Mengchun. On the 21st, U.S. jeep number 13045 killed an Indian man named Maidason. On the same day, U.S. truck number 62698 injured pedestrian Zhou Quanfang and then sped away. On the 12th, a U.S. jeep overturned a pedicab, and passenger Ren Chuijian and the driver suffered severe head injuries. On the 26th, U.S. truck number 90839 injured pedestrian Ruan Kuilin. Furthermore, the arbitrary molestation of women by U.S. troops and the robbery of merchants' cigarettes and clothing under the pretext of searching for military supplies are too numerous to count. On the evening of the 26th, a U.S. soldier broke into the dormitory of female staff members of the Chinese Communist Party delegation stationed in Beiping, room 229 of the Beijing Hotel, and fled only after being sternly rebuked. Such atrocities by U.S. troops have aroused extreme indignation among people from all walks of life in Pingjin. The Tianjin Dagong Daily alone received five letters from readers in the past month protesting the atrocities of U.S. troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: News from Shanghai: On September 22nd, another tragedy occurred in Shanghai where a U.S. soldier beat a rickshaw puller to death. The deceased, named Zhang Zhicheng, pulled a Spanish man named "Lai Lingren Nai" to the Huadu Ballroom on Xikou Road on the evening of the 22nd. Lai refused to pay the fare after getting out of the car and went inside, so Zhang waited at the entrance of the ballroom. After a long time, the Spanish man came out with a U.S. soldier. Zhang stepped forward to ask for money, but the U.S. sailor, without asking the reason, punched Zhang violently, causing him to fall to the ground with serious injuries and lose consciousness. This immediately aroused the anger of the onlookers, and some people tried to fight back but were stopped by a street policeman. Later, a U.S. military patrol jeep forced its way through the crowd, put the offending U.S. soldier in the car, and sped away. Zhang was sent to the hospital, but due to his serious injuries, he died on the 23rd.
