Xinhua News Agency, Zuoyun, 2nd. Over the past ten days, the Eighth Route Army in the suburbs of Datong has repelled three attacks by Yan's pseudo-army towards Kouquan. The Kouquan station and Yanghebao area, 13 li west of Datong city, remain under the control of the Eighth Route Army. On the 17th and 18th of last month, over 500 troops from the 39th division of Yan's pseudo-army were repelled in two attacks on the garrison camp 7 li west of Datong city. On the 25th, at dawn, the entire 2nd regiment of the 38th division of Yan's pseudo-army, consisting of over 800 men, accompanied by over ten cars and three tanks, launched a fierce attack on the Kouquan mining area, with Japanese troops acting as the vanguard. They engaged in fierce battles with the Eighth Route Army in the Wangjiayuan to Pingwang line, 40 li west of the city. By 1:00 PM, the Yan pseudo-army was lured to the vicinity of Kouquan. On the night of the 26th, the Eighth Route Army launched a counter-attack, encircling the enemy from the west, south, and north. The Yan pseudo-army suffered heavy casualties and the remaining troops collapsed and retreated. In this battle, over 400 Yan soldiers were killed or wounded. The Yan army stationed at Xiaozhan, 12 li west of Datong city, also fled in panic. To summarize, in the past two months, the Yan-Japanese pseudo-army in the Datong area has suffered over 4,000 killed, wounded, and captured, accounting for about half of their total strength.

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 1st. Yan Xishan ceded the important city of Linfen in southern Shanxi to Hu Zongnan's troops to take over defense in mid-month. The 39th, 66th, 72nd, and parts of the 69th divisions of Yan's army originally stationed in Linfen, in coordination with the remnants of Yan's troops from Puxian, Xixian, Lingshi and other places, re-invaded Pingchuan in central Shanxi. It is reported that Yan's army has sneaked into the Linfen area on the 26th, invading towns such as Shuangchi Town in Lingshi, Dui Jiuyu in Xiaoyi, and Shikou in Xixian. Local troops of the Eighth Route Army are now coordinating with the militia to encircle and attack them.
