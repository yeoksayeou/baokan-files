　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. Military News: Our army withdrew from Zhangjiakou on the afternoon of the 11th. The city had been evacuated long ago. The invaders of Zhangjiakou were the Fu Zuoyi troops that came south from Zhangbei. Our army's temporary abandonment of Zhangjiakou will not affect our army's operations on the east and west battlefields of the Ping-Sui Railway. On the contrary, the result the enemy gets is a dispersed force, while our army can act more freely and annihilate the enemy more thoroughly. After the enemy is annihilated, Zhangjiakou will still belong to the Chinese people.

　　让蒋贼多吞一颗炸弹！
    我军暂时放弃张垣
    今后将更可行动自如痛快歼敌
    【新华社延安十二日电】军息：我军已于十一日下午撤离张家口。该城早经疏散。侵入张垣者系由张北南下的傅作义部。我军暂时放弃张家口，并不影响我军在平绥路东西两战场之作战，相反的敌人所得的结果，是兵力分散，我军则得以更加行动自如痛快歼敌，在敌人被歼之后，张家口仍是中国人民的。
