　　Chiang Kai-shek's Peace Smokescreen Collapses
    Liberation Daily Commentary
    This newspaper has pointed out more than once that the Chiang faction's "peace offensive" is to shirk responsibility for the all-out civil war and to cover up larger-scale military operations. The developments of the past few days have further proved the correctness of our assertion. Chiang Kai-shek, pretending to be "peaceful," repeatedly urged representatives of various parties to go to Nanjing to "discuss peace," but when they accepted the invitation and arrived in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek slipped away to Taiwan. Behind the smokescreen of the "peace offensive," Chiang Kai-shek made further deployments for a major offensive. Even United Press International, in a dispatch from Nanjing, had to admit this fact: "The government side does not attach importance to this (referring to the arrival of representatives of various parties in Nanjing) and is preparing for all military actions."
    Today, things have become even clearer. Chiang's troops are launching large-scale offensives against Andong in the Northeast, Yantai in Shandong, and Lianshui in northern Jiangsu. The sound of Chiang's troops' cannons in these areas has completely exposed Chiang Kai-shek's peace smokescreen. No matter how eloquently Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda minister, Peng Xuepei, argues, saying that "the military situation in various places is generally tending towards peace," the smokescreen that has been torn down can never be mended. Chiang Kai-shek not only refused to withdraw from the illegally occupied areas after January 13th, in accordance with the January truce order, and to withdraw the illegally mobilized troops, but also intensified his actions by launching new large-scale military offensives. This proves that Chiang Kai-shek has not changed his consistent practice of repeatedly breaking faith, and he is determined to tear the truce order to shreds. To cover up this ugly truth, Peng Xuepei again used his silver tongue, saying that Chiang Kai-shek's "eight demands, in addition to offering new concessions, do not contain any new demands."
    However, today everyone can clearly see that Chiang's troops' so-called "new concessions" are actually to continue and expand the military offensive against the liberated areas, and to attempt to legitimize the illegal actions of tearing up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.
    The military and civilians of the liberated areas have not made any "new demands." What the military and civilians of the liberated areas insist on is only the implementation of the truce order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The truce order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented and Chiang Kai-shek must not be allowed to undermine them. This is a matter of course and beyond dispute. The military and civilians of the liberated areas will inevitably give a resolute and effective counterattack to Chiang Kai-shek's new military offensives. Our sacred self-defense war to realize the truce order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will inevitably be victorious.

### 蒋介石和平烟幕的破灭  解放日报时评

　　蒋介石和平烟幕的破灭
    解放日报时评
    本报曾不止一次地指出蒋方的“和平攻势”，是为了推卸全面内战的责任，和掩护更大规模的军事行动。几天来事变的发展，更加证明了我们这一论断的正确。蒋介石假装“和平”姿态，再三敦促各党派代表赴南京“商谈和平”，但是当他们应邀到宁的时候，蒋介石就一溜烟的飞到台湾去。在“和平攻势”的烟幕后面，蒋介石作了进一步大打的部署，这一事实连合众社从南京发出的电讯都不得不承认：“政府方面对此（指各党派代表到宁事）并不重视，而作一切军事行动的准备。”
    到了今天，事情更加清楚了，蒋军正在大举进犯东北之安东，山东之烟台与苏北之涟水，这些地方蒋军的炮声已经完全揭破了蒋介石的和平烟幕。不管蒋介石宣传部长彭学沛怎样巧辩，说什么“各地军事大致趋于平靖”，但是已经揭破了的烟幕，是绝对无法弥缝的。蒋介石不仅拒绝了按照一月停战令退出一月十三号以后非法侵占地区，及撤回非法调动的军队的要求，而且变本加厉举行新的大规模军事进攻，这证明蒋介石毫未改变过去屡次背信弃义之一贯作风，他决心把停战令撕得粉碎。为了掩盖这一丑恶的真相，彭学沛又鼓其如簧之古，说蒋介石的“八项要求，除提出新让步外，不包含任何新要求”。
    但是，今天谁都可以看清楚，蒋军的所谓“新让步”，实际上就是继续和扩大对解放区的军事进攻，就是妄图将撕毁停战协定及政协决议的非法行动成为合法化。
    解放区军民并没有提出任何“新要求”，解放区军民所坚持的仅仅是停战令和政协会决议的实现，停战令和政协会决议必须实现，决不容许蒋介石破坏，此乃天经地义无可置辩。解放区军民对于蒋介石新的军事进攻，必然予以坚决有效的回击，我们为了实现停战令与政协决议的神圣自卫战争，必然要得到胜利。
