　　Post-War Economic Panic in the United States
　　James Allen, Member of the Central Committee of the American Communist Party

　　The United States has always been known for the particular severity of its economic panics. The reason why crises in the United States tend to be deeper than in other countries lies in several characteristics of our industrial development: larger output than other countries, higher shutdown rates, and the advantage of monopoly capital. These factors have been strengthened during the war. The large-scale expansion of wartime industries, especially basic and heavy industries, has accumulated all these factors, creating a major collapse. What is worse is that these expansions occurred almost entirely in the supply of munitions and the heavy industries that were particularly expanded due to the war, such as aviation, shipbuilding, explosives, and light metals. These industries employed more than one-fifth more workers in 1944 than before the war. These are all means of production industries, and their production levels determine the rise and fall of the American economy. After these industries return to peacetime conditions, nowhere can they find a market comparable to the wartime government’s patronage, when government orders reached 90 billion US dollars annually.

　　We have already seen how labor productivity increased during the war, and how it will continue to increase. The impact this has on employment and purchasing power can be seen from a simple comparison. Although industrial production increased by 120 percent from 1939 to 1944, the number of newly employed workers in these industries only increased by 60 percent. According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, if production falls to the 1940 level (which was a year of relatively high output), output will decrease by 30 percent compared to wartime levels, resulting in unemployment of 19 million people, compared to 9 million unemployed in 1940. Monopoly is also accelerating and prolonging the panic and delaying its recovery. In boom times, it increases prices but cannot increase output, hindering the rise in production. In times of recession, it reduces output but still maintains prices, which accelerates the decline in production as soon as the market contracts. During the recovery from the panic, it immediately raises prices as soon as it sees a slight increase in purchasing power, thus delaying the recovery like an ox cart.

　　Wartime full employment and full utilization of industrial products and raw materials created enormous mass purchasing power, but because industry had to devote itself to the war and could not produce many consumer goods, especially larger items such as cars and refrigerators, a large portion of this purchasing power was saved. This situation will end with a short-term boom. The period this boom lasts will only be until the people have used up their wartime savings and the purchasing power created during this boom disappears. At least two-thirds of the total wartime government bonds are in the hands of companies, banks, life insurance companies, and other large enterprises, leaving only 12 billion US dollars in the hands of lower-income groups, and much of that has already been used for current living expenses.

　　What follows the boom is panic. This is not an ordinary economic panic. If it strikes with full force and the government cannot cope with it to mitigate its impact, it will be more severe than the most terrible Great Depression of 1929-1933 that we experienced.

　　While capitalist countries, especially the United States, are declining at an unprecedented rate, the socialist economy is developing at a rate unparalleled since the last World War. If the economic panic in the United States occurs as we expect, the Soviet Union will not only surpass the United States in total production, but may even surpass the United States in per capita production.

　　We can clearly see why the big trusts want to occupy key positions and determine the main course of our country's policies once the boom is over. While they intensify their exploitation of the market during the boom period and acquire everything, they are also preparing for the panic.

　　Their first task is to shift the main burden of the panic onto the workers and the general population. Another task is to try to expand their international markets and spheres of influence as much as possible before the panic arrives. This creates a double crisis. Such an expansion sacrifices the interests of other imperialist countries or the national sovereignty and democratic rights of other peoples. It exacerbates all factors of political conflict and strikes at world peace. Another major impact is that when the panic comes to the United States, it will drag down a far larger part of the world economy, which in turn will deepen the panic in the United States.

　　Monopoly capital has another important task, which is to make political preparations for the panic. In this preparation, military force occupies an extremely important position. Domestic political preparations are used to encourage and cultivate all forces that can be used as resistance against the people's attacks on the trusts. Monopoly capital is waging this struggle to gain irresistible national power, which necessarily involves a struggle against the workers and the people, directly causing the threat of fascism to re-emerge.

　　美国战后经济恐慌
    美共中委  詹姆士·爱伦
    美国素来就以它经济恐慌的特殊严重性著称，危机在美国所以比其他各国更趋于深重，原因在于我国工业发展的若干特点，即产量较其他各国为大，停工生产率较高，与独占资本之优势。这些因素在战时愈见增强，战时工业特别是基本工业与重工业的大规模膨胀，已使所有这些因素积累，而在造成大的崩溃。更甚者，即这些膨胀几乎完全发生在供给军火与因为战争而特别扩充了重工业中，如航空造船炸药与轻金属等工业。这些工业，在一九四四年雇用的工人超过战前的五分之一以上，这些都是生产品工业，他们的生产水平决定了美国经济的升降。这些工业恢复到平时状态之后，在任何地方都找不到一个可以比得上战时政府照顾那样的市场，那时政府订货每年达九百万万美元。
    我们已经看见劳动生产率如何在战时提高，和它将如何继续提高，这样对就业与购买力所生的影响可以从简单的比较上看出来，虽则从一九三九年到一九四四年的工业生产量增加了百分之一百二十，但这些工业中新雇用的工人却只增加了百分之六十。根据商务部的统计，如果生产量降低到一九四○年的水平（那是产量相当高的一年），出品就要比战时水平减少百分之三十，结果失业人数将达一千九百万人，而一九四○年失业人数则为九百万人。独占也在加速和拖长恐慌，并延缓其恢复。在景气的时候，它增加价格，却不能增加出产品，阻碍了生产的上升。在不景气的时候，它减少出品地还要维持价格，这样一等到市场紧缩，便加速了生产的跌落。在恐慌恢复的时候，它又要一看见购买力略有起色，便立刻提高了价格，因而像牛车一样延缓了恢复。
    在战时充分就业，工业品与原料之充分利用，造成了极大的大众购买力，但是因为工业要致力于战争，不能生产许多消费品，特别是较大的如汽车与冰箱等，这购买力就有很大的一部分储蓄了起来。这种情形将以一个短期的繁荣结束。这繁荣持续的时期，只等人民把战时积蓄用光与在这一繁荣时期造成的购买力消失，那就过去了。战时公债总数至少有三分之二是在公司银行人寿保险公司与其他大企业手里，剩下来的只有一百二十万万美元是在收入较低的人群手里，而其中有许多已经用于当前的生活费中了。
    跟着繁荣之后而来的就是恐慌，这不是一个普通的经济恐慌，如果它以全力袭来，而政府不能应付以缓和它的冲势的话，它将比我们所经验到的最可怕的一九二九——一九三三年的大恐慌更严重。
    当资本主义国家特别是美国正以空前未有的速率趋于没落的时候，社会主义经济正以自上次大战以来就无可比拟的速率发展，如果美国的经济恐慌以我们所料的进程发生，苏联不但在总生产上会超过美国，甚至每一个人的生产量上都可以超过美国。
    我们可以清楚，为什么一旦繁荣过去大托拉斯便想占据要津，并决定我国政策的主要路线。当他们加紧榨取繁荣时期的市场已取得一切的时候，它们也已经在为恐慌作准备了。
    它们第一件要事便是把恐慌的主要负担移到工人与一般人民的身上。另一件要事便是在恐慌到来以前尽其所能的设法扩大它们国际市场与势力范围，这产生了双重的危机，这样的一个膨胀就牺牲了别个帝国主义国家的利益，或别国人民的民族主权与民主权利，它使一切政治冲突的因素益趋严重，打击了世界和平。另一个主要的影响是当恐慌来到美国的时候，就会连累着拖垮世界经济远为广大的一部分，它又反过来加深了美国的恐慌。
    独占资本还有一件要事，就是为恐慌作政治上的准备。在这准备中，军事力量居有极其重要的地位，国内的政治准备被用来鼓励并培养一切可以当作反对人民对托拉斯进攻的抵抗之力量。独占资本为要取得国家无可抗拒的权力而作这斗争，这必要对工人和人民进行斗争，直接使法西斯的威胁重新兴起。
