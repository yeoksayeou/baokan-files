　　Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 13th: This reporter recently visited Shao Kewu, a lieutenant pilot (Kuomintang member) who was rescued from the Jiang aircraft shot down on the 26th of last month while harassing Yantai. He first said, "From the Kuomintang newspaper propaganda and lectures from superiors, I was told that the Eighth Route Army abused and killed prisoners. When I was first rescued, I thought I was finished, but who knew I would be treated so well.” He expressed surprise at the harmonious relationship between the army and civilians in the liberated areas, the soldiers' high spirits, and their comfortable lives. He said, "This is not seen in the Kuomintang-controlled areas." What particularly interested him was the attitude of a staff officer of the Eighth Route Army when talking to him yesterday. He said, "If someone hadn't introduced him, I simply wouldn't have guessed he was a staff officer. If such a staff officer were in the Kuomintang, wouldn't he be incredibly arrogant!” He said with emotion, "To be honest, none of us pilots feel any interest in fighting the civil war. Who can bear to use American weapons to slaughter our own compatriots?” Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's collusion with American reactionaries to sell out Chinese sovereignty, he said, "The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also see it clearly, but they dare not speak out. Now many national industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai and Nanjing have been bankrupted by the dumping of American goods, and American goods completely control the Chinese market. In addition, with the increase in exchange rates, prices will rise and fall with the US dollar in the future. The lifeline of the national economy will be completely controlled by the United States.” When talking about the atrocities of American troops insulting decent women and arbitrarily running over pedestrians in Nanjing and Shanghai, Shao said, "This is simply the same attitude that the Japanese had towards the Chinese before the War of Resistance!”

　　烟台被击落之蒋机驾驶员谈
    彼等对内战无兴趣
    美军在京沪有如战前日本人
    【新华社莱阳十三日电】记者顷走访上月二十六日袭扰烟台被击落蒋机中获救之中尉驾驶员邵可武（国民党员），他首先说：“在外边看国民党报纸宣传，听长官们训话，都说八路军虐杀俘虏，我刚被救出时，心想一定完了，谁知道这样受优待。”他对解放区军民关系融洽，战士们精神饱满，生活优裕，表示惊异。他说：“这是国民党统治地区所见不到的。”尤其使他感兴趣的，是昨天八路军某参谋长和他谈话时的态度。他说：“要不是有人介绍，我简直猜不出他是个参谋长。如果在国民党那边，这样一个参谋长，那威风还了得吗！”他感慨地说：“说句老实话，我们驾驶员对打内战谁也不感觉兴趣。拿着美国武器来屠杀自己的同胞，谁心能忍呢？”关于蒋介石勾结美国反动派出卖中国主权，他说：“国民党统治区的老百姓也都看得明白，只是敢怒不敢言。现在上海、南京很多民族工商业都被美货的倾销冲倒了，美货完全操纵了中国市场。加之汇率提高，今后物价都随美金涨落。国民经济命脉也就完全被美国操纵了。”谈到美军在京沪侮辱良家妇女，汽车任意撞毙行人的暴行时，邵氏说：“这简直是抗战前日本人对中国人的态度！”
