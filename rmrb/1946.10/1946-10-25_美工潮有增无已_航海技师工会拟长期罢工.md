　　US Labor Unrest Grows
    Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association Plans Long-Term Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Reports from various sources indicate that the strike wave in the United States is growing. Representatives of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) left Washington on the 17th because the Department of Labor was not prepared to resume negotiations. A spokesperson for the union stated that the union leaders are preparing for a long-term strike; if this occurs, American shipping will be greatly affected, and the economy and commerce will inevitably suffer partial paralysis. Furthermore, the West Coast Maritime Council of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (an organization representing seven unions with over 200,000 workers, aiming to unite the various unions in the region) issued a statement advocating that military vessels should only be loaded with food, clothing, and medical supplies.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" observer Georgiev pointed out that a characteristic of the past month was the sudden increase in strike movements in American industry. The author analyzes this situation and writes: "The anti-labor policy of American monopoly capital is part of their overall post-war program. Their overall program includes expansion and hegemonic ambitions that seriously threaten peace, which has met with increasing resistance from the democratic masses. This is why the reactionaries are clamoring for a 'tough' policy towards the labor movement." The author also points out that Wallace predicted in August that the economic crisis coming in a year or two will cause even more suffering to millions of Americans, and monopoly capital wants to take advantage of the workers' difficulties to intensify their exploitation, shamelessly hoping that the threat of starvation will force workers to diligently hold onto their jobs. It is very clear that such a selfish policy of the big capitalists has met with resistance from the working class, which has been manifested in the strike movement (Note: In the past month in the United States, strikes have broken out one after another, involving more than 680,000 people).

　　美工潮有增无已
    航海技师工会拟长期罢工
    【新华社延安二十日电】各方报导：美国罢工浪潮有增无已。产业工会联合会之航海技师工会代表因劳工部不作恢复谈判准备，已于十七日离华盛顿。该工会发言人称：工会诸领袖正准备作长期罢工；果尔，则美国海运必大受影响，经济与商业定将部分遭受麻痹。又产业工会联合会西部海岸海员同业委员会（代表二十余万工人之七个工会代表组织，目的在使此间的各工会团结一致）曾发表谈话，主张限定军用船只只装粮食被服及医药用品。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家乔吉也夫指出：过去一月的特点，是美国工业中罢工运动的骤增。作者分析这种情势写道：美国独占资本的反劳工政策，乃是他们战后的总纲领的一部分。在他们的总纲领中，包括严重威胁和平的扩张和攫取霸权的计划，这已遇到民主群众日益增长的抵抗，这就是为什么反动派狂叫对劳工运动采取“强硬”政策之故。作者并指出华莱士在八月预料一两年内到来的经济危机，将使美国千百万人民更为痛苦，独占资本想趁着工人困难之际，加紧对工人剥削，并无耻地希望饥饿的威胁将迫使工人兢兢业业保存饭碗。十分明白，大资本家这种自私的政策，已遭到工人阶级的抵抗，这已在罢工运动中表现出来了（按：美国过去一月罢工，接踵而来，人数达六十八万以上）。
