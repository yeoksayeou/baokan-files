　　Ren Keliang's Militia Guerrilla Force

　　Ren Keliang, one of the organizers and leaders of the Xia County Militia Guerrilla Force, is from the first district of Xia County. He serves as the company commander of the second company of the county's militia guerrilla force. He is nearsighted, wearing a pair of high-prescription glasses, but he has a very far-sighted political vision and resolutely and bravely fights against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. Often, by the time he sees the Chiang army, they are already right in front of him. However, he always tells the militiamen, "Don't move when you see the Chiang army. Only when *I* see them are you allowed to act." Everyone laughs at him affectionately. Now, the guerrilla force he leads is active in the Chiang army-occupied areas, assisting the Eighth Route Army in combat, and has achieved remarkable success.

　　On August 15th, the Chiang army began its offensive with great force. Ren Keliang's guerrilla force could not hold out in Emei Ridge in the first district and, under the harassment of five or six Chiang army planes, moved to the eastern slope of the second district. The next day (the 16th), the Chiang army set out from Zhaocun and Cuijiahe to attack them in Nanbeijin. He immediately led a squad of militiamen to the mountain pass in front and pushed the Chiang army back, killing one Chiang soldier. The militiamen of the second district, originally at Nan Jin Fort opposite, also came to cooperate in the battle, forming a two-sided attack. The Chiang army could not resist and had to run away with their tails between their legs.

　　After a fierce battle, regardless of fatigue, to help our regular army cut the power lines, he took a squad of people down Emei Ridge that afternoon, searching everywhere. Everyone was very tired, but because they hadn't found the power lines, they were unwilling to return empty-handed. The next day (the 17th), they captured a Chiang-appointed village chief, an assistant, and three village policemen in Shizhuang, and finally cut back more than ten catties of insulated wire.

　　Their active operations became a major concern for the Chiang army. On the 18th, the Chiang army deployed more than a thousand troops to Huzhang to encircle and annihilate them. On the morning of the 19th, they were at Zhaocun Ridge, staying behind Huzhang. The Chiang army first sent one hundred and twenty men to Zhaocun Ridge, surrounding the village in two routes. But they had already safely moved to Yinzhuang Village and Baogou. The Chiang army then divided its forces and, from Huzhang, dispatched a force of about three hundred men to attack Yinzhuang directly. At this time, the Chiang army from Zhaocun and Qihe Villages also moved out together. Again, they could not hold out and retreated to the ridges of Dongzhangnan Village. Unexpectedly, Dongzhangnan and Wang Villages were already surrounded by the Chiang army on all sides, but he still resolutely fought to seize the opportunity to strike the enemy, leading the militiamen out of Dongzhangnan. During the breakout, our militiaman Guo Kuiyuan bravely sacrificed his life. Comrade Ren Keliang looked back and saw that he was still carrying a gun, so he returned, ignoring the Chiang army's shooting, and risked his life to snatch the rifle from Guo Kuiyuan's body. That day, when the Chiang army arrived at × Village, they killed Guo Cai'an, the vice chairman of our farmers' association and militia instructor, and took away Guo Zhongqiu, the deputy commander of our village sub-command, Guo Keqin, the director of finance and grain, and Ren Yinshuo, a villager. They also took away Ren Keliang's livestock. When Ren Keliang learned of this news, he did not feel discouraged at all. On the contrary, his determination became even stronger. "This must have been done by spies. I am determined to take revenge. I will go down to the village tonight to comfort the families of the deceased. The more the Chiang army strikes us, the more determined we must be to fight them."

　　Now Ren Keliang more often takes the initiative to strike the Chiang army. On September 3rd, they captured a "Central Army" soldier who had fled back from Tongshan Town. That night, they cooperated with the × regiment to ambush the enemy in Guoli. The next day (September 4th) morning, twenty-eight Chiang soldiers came down from Yuwang Temple to Guoli Village. Ren Keliang led the militiamen to join forces with the × regiment and completely annihilated the Chiang army, killing four and capturing twenty-four, seizing a total of twenty-four rifles, one machine gun, and four pistols. Ren Keliang and his comrades also captured a company commander and two platoon leaders from the Anyi "Struggle Corps," and seized one machine gun, one 60mm mortar, and two bags of bullets. Now, the militia led by Ren Keliang is constantly attacking the Chiang army with the Chiang army's own weapons.

　　任克良的民兵游击队
    夏县民兵游击队的组织领导者之一任克良是夏县一区人，担任该县民兵游击队二连连长，他是个近视眼，带着一付多度的近视眼镜，但他在政治上却看的很远，很坚定勇敢的和蒋伪作斗争。往往当他看见蒋军的时候，蒋军就已到跟前了，可是他总常告诉民兵说：“看见蒋军不要动，几时我看见了才准行动。”大家都很亲密的笑他。现在他带的游击队活跃于蒋军侵占区协助八路军作战，已获得奇异的成就。
    八月十五日蒋军开始进攻，来势凶猛，任克良游击队在一区峨嵋岭无法坚持，从蒋军五六架飞机的袭扰下转移到二区的东山坡上。第二天（十六号），蒋军由赵村、崔家河出发，到南北晋进攻他们，他立即带着一班民兵赶到前边的山嘴上，把蒋军压回，打死蒋军一人。二区民兵原在对面南晋堡上，这时也来配合作战，形成两面夹击，蒋军抵抗不过，只得夹着尾巴窜回去了。
    在一场激战之后，他们不顾疲劳，为了帮助我们正规军割电线，当天下午他即带着一班人下了峨嵋岭，到处寻找着，每个人都很疲倦了，可是因为没有找着电线，他们总不甘心空手回来。第二天（十七号），他们在史庄俘获蒋治村村长一名，协助员一名，村警三名，终于割回被复线十余斤。
    他们积极的活动，成了蒋军的心腹大患，十八日，蒋军竟以千余到胡张布置围歼他们。十九日早晨他们在赵村岭，后住于胡张，蒋军就先以一百二十名来赵村岭，分两路将村包围，而他们已安全的转移到阴庄村、堡沟，蒋军即分路安排，并从胡张调出一股，约三百人，直扑阴庄。这时，赵村、其河村蒋军也一齐出动，他们又无法坚持，就往东西张南村岭上拉，又不料西张南和王村都已有蒋军四面包围，但他仍坚决奋战，以便乘机打击敌人，便领着民兵从东张南冲出去了。在往外冲的中间，我民兵郭奎元英勇牺牲，任克良同志回头一看他身上还带着枪，于是又返回去，不顾蒋军射击，拚着命把郭奎元身上的步枪夺了下来。这天蒋军到×村时，打死我农会副主席兼民兵指导员郭彩安，又将我村副指挥部郭中秋、财粮主任郭克勤、村民任银锁三人拉走，还牵去了任克良家的牲口，任克良知道这消息后，没有丝毫的灰心丧气，相反的，更坚硬了他的决心。“这一定是奸细搞的，我下决心要报仇哩。我今晚要下到村里去安慰死者的家庭。”“蒋军越打击我们，我们也越要决心打他。”
    现在任克良更经常主动的打击蒋军，九月三号，他们在西洞村抓获从同善镇跑回来的“中央军”一名，当晚，又配合×团到郭里打埋伏。第二天（九月四号）早晨，从禹王庙下来二十八个蒋军到郭里村，任克良便领着民兵与×团合击，将蒋军全部解决，打死四名，俘虏二十四名，共缴获步枪二十四支，机枪一挺，手枪四支。任克良他们还俘虏了安邑“奋斗团”的一个连长，两个排长，并缴获机枪一挺，六零连一支，子弹两袋。现在任克良领导的民兵，正以蒋军的武装不断打击蒋军。
