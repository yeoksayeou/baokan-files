　　【Report from our correspondent in Weixian】Since the leadership of En County emphasized the need to be bold and emancipate minds, the worries about mass mobilization leading to chaos have been dispelled. Cadres and the masses have finally been able to unleash their full potential, and a large-scale mobilization has quickly unfolded.

　　The First District initially put forward the slogan: "Consolidate one area and attack in all directions." In a short period of time, it gathered the emancipated masses from more than ten villages, marching towards the feudal fortress of Beizhan with gongs and drums. Two thousand people arrived at Beizhan and shouted in unison: "Organization brings strength! Chopping down big trees provides firewood!" The emancipated masses spoke to acquaintances, saying: "Get to work, folks! My family has received an acre of land per person!" The masses of Beizhan applauded and welcomed them, showing envious expressions. Women who were initially peeking through door cracks saw the parade included young women with braids. They stepped out of their houses and stood on the street. The female activists in the parade immediately joined the women, saying: "Men are being emancipated, and we women must be emancipated too!" As a result, Beizhan organized ninety people overnight. In just a few days, the masses from twelve villages south of the city united and overthrew the puppet town chief, Ji Dianlu. The impact resonated throughout the villages. The masses everywhere looked for cadres and activists, requesting assistance and asking for guidance. More than one hundred villages were quickly mobilized.

　　The following issues were grasped during the mass mobilization:

　　(1) When a mass mobilization forms and the masses are organized on a large scale, landlords and bad elements will take the opportunity to pretend to be active and infiltrate. At this time, cadres should go deep into the grassroots and avoid superficiality. After Beizhan was organized overnight, the cadres quickly went deep into it, selected one or two activists, conducted door-to-door checks, and reorganized fifty basic peasants. The basic masses seized leadership and eliminated the bad elements.

　　(2) Focusing the target on the landlords, breaking out of the narrow organization of "poor people's groups," and allowing large numbers of middle peasants to join, united the majority of the masses. In Fuzhuang, the number of Farmer's Association members quickly expanded from eleven to more than one hundred. Young women also broke through their shyness and established women's associations. Within half a month, 65 percent of the masses organized themselves.

　　(3) The activists' joint conference is the best organization for the masses to exchange experiences, discuss solutions together, and realize leadership. The small-area activists' joint conference is formed and convened by the activists themselves. The conference period and the number of participants should not be rigidly fixed at five days or a few activists. At the joint conference, one village reports and other villages listen. The good aspects are learned by everyone, the errors are corrected by everyone, and difficult problems are discussed and solved. This has a great effect on mobilizing the surrounding villages. On the other hand, it improves leadership, changing the past method of sending cadres to each village to defend and gnaw at one village to death, avoiding the cadres' acting as substitutes for the masses. Two or three cadres, through the activists' joint conference, can quickly and powerfully promote the work of the whole village or small area.

　　(4) The militia is the armed force of the peasants, and the handle of the knife must be in the hands of good people. In the peasant movement, it is not appropriate to emphasize the separate organization of the militia, as this can easily lead to contradictions between the militia and the Farmer's Association, making it easier for bad elements to seize control. It must be made clear that the militia must be under the leadership of the Farmer's Association.

　　(5) In the mass mobilization, it is necessary to cherish the enthusiasm of the masses and correct deviations without pouring cold water. In areas that have already been mobilized, a "thorough cleansing" must be carried out. Removing the hats of traitors, opposing traitors, opposing local bullies, and opposing the stubborn are all mixed together and cooked in one pot. During this period, there are many struggle meetings in each village, and almost everywhere there are gongs and drums, and there are struggle meetings every day. In newly mobilized areas, one village holds a meeting, and surrounding villages come to participate. When encountering a large struggle target, more than ten villages, or even one or two small areas, unite to fight. Villages that have not yet been mobilized, other villages are fighting to help, and the masses are also brewing to fight. In the market, acquaintances meet acquaintances, old ladies visit relatives, and the central content of conversation is the struggle, just like the tide rising, hot and lively. But in individual villages, there may also be some deviations: for example, Village A goes to Village B to detain people; rich middle peasants are afraid of being taken away by outside villages and ask their own village to fight them and hand over land; landlords and bad elements lure some of the masses to create false struggles in an attempt to cope with the situation. The leadership should not be afraid of these deviations and rush to correct them, not simply criticizing the cadres and masses and打击 their enthusiasm, but handing over the policies to the masses, not saying that the masses do not understand the policies, but guiding the activists to review each other,展开 discussions, and let the masses correct themselves.

### 恩县领导放手创造大动经验

　　恩县领导放手创造大动经验
    【本报威县讯】恩县自领导上强调提出大胆放手后，怕大动出乱子的顾虑得到解除，干部与群众才放开了手足，分头下去，大动局面很快的开展起来。
    一区一开始就提出：“整好一片，向四外进攻”的口号来。短时间内，集结了十多个村的翻身群众，敲着锣鼓，声势浩荡的向封建堡垒——北站进军。两千群众，进抵北站后，齐声嘶喊：“组织起来力量大，刨倒大树有柴烧。”翻身群众，见熟人就讲：“干罢！伙计，我家每口人分得了一亩地！”北站的群众鼓掌欢迎，显出羡慕的神气来，妇女们原先是从门缝里偷瞧，一看游行队伍里有带辫子的大闺女，走出门来站在街头，游行的女积极分子马上站到女人群里讲：“男的翻身，咱们女的也要翻身。”这样一来，北站一夜就组织起九十个人来。不过几天，城南十二个村的群众，又联合斗倒了伪镇长纪殿录，影响所及，村村震动，群众到处找干部，找积极分子，要求去帮助，请示办法，一百多个村，很快的轰动起来了。
    大动当中掌握了以下几个问题：
    （一）群众大动局面形成，群众大批的组织起来，地主坏分子也会趁机假积极混进来。此时，干部应深入下去，力避飘浮。北站一夜组织起来后，干部很快的深入进去，选择出一两个积极分子，进行了挨户检查，重新串联组织了五十个基本农民，基本群众掌握了领导权，把坏人删下。
    （二）集中目标对地主，跳出“贫民组”的狭小组织，大批中农涌进来，团结了群众大多数。傅庄四十八户，农会会员由十一人很快的扩大到一百多人。青年妇女也打破害羞思想，成立起妇女会来，半个月的时间内，就有百分之六十五的群众自己组织起来。
    （三）积极分子联席会是群众交流翻身经验，共同商讨办法，实现领导的最好组织。小区积极分子联席会，由积极分子自己形成，自己召开。会期与参加人数，不要死拘于五天与几个积极分子。联席会上是一村报告，各村来听，好的大家学，错误大家纠正，发现疑难问题大家商讨解决，这对轰动片村有很大的作用。另一方面，改善了领导，一变过去村村派干部，分兵把守，死啃一村的办法，避免了干部的包办代替。两三个干部，经过积极分子联席会，便迅速而有力地推动了全村或小区的工作。
    （四）民兵是农民的武装，刀把必须交好人掌握，在农民运动当中，不宜强调民兵的单独组织，这样易使民兵与农会矛盾，便利坏分子从中掌握。明确民兵必须受农会的领导。
    （五）在大动中要爱护群众的热情，纠正偏向不要泼冷水，现在已经动起来的地区，要“大清底”。摘汉奸帽、反奸、反恶霸、反顽固，都混杂在一起，一锅熟下来，这一期间，是各村斗争会很多，差不多到处有锣鼓声，天天有斗争会。新发动起来的地区，一村开会，周围村来参加，遇到大的斗争对象，十几个村，甚而一两个小区联合斗。未动的村，外村争着去帮助，群众也酝酿着斗，集市上，熟人见熟人，老太太串亲戚，谈话的中心资料是斗争的事，真如海水升潮，热火朝天。但个别的村庄，也会出现些偏差：如甲村到乙村去扣人，富裕中农骇怕被外村抓走，要求本村斗一下，交出土地来；地主与坏分子利诱一部群众，制造假斗争，企图应付过去等。领导上对这些偏差，丝毫不要骇怕忙着纠正，不是单纯给干部群众以批评打击他们的热情，而是要把政策交给群众，不要说群众不懂政策，要很好的引导积极分子互相检讨，展开讨论，让群众自己纠正。
