"The Savior is Here!"
    Cao Jing Si
    I was discussing last night's battle with other comrades when I suddenly heard a commotion in the street. I went out and saw a group of soldiers surrounding an old woman in her forties. She was crying and talking like a madwoman, "Oh heavens! Oh heavens! My savior!" As she spoke, she grabbed a soldier's hand, staring at him intently, without saying a word, tears streaming down her face. After a long while, she finally said, "Shuan! You are here." She then burst into loud sobs.
    Li Shuan was also from Xixia Han. He and her husband used to work for a landlord, driving a cart together. After the Eighth Route Army came here, Li Shuan broke away from his previous life and joined the ranks. His partner also joined the farmers' association, and they each embarked on different bright futures. Today's encounter made her unable to hold back her tears.
    When the enemy occupied Xixia Han, the "Homecoming Corps" and "Revenge Squad" all returned. They captured Li Shuan's partner, and also captured farmers like Li Shuan's partner, and locked them all in a small house. The landlord of the "Homecoming Corps" stared at them with menacing eyes, spitting from his man-eating mouth, "You relied on the cadres and lost your conscience, clearing debts and settling accounts! You clear! You settle! Let's see who settles whom! You settle my accounts, I'll settle your lives! Today, we're going to give you a 'human headstand'!"
    She wiped her tears and said to him, "Those dogs occupied our village. I was hoping for our Eighth Route Army to come and fight. After he (her husband) was arrested, I was even more anxious. One dark night a few days ago, I had just closed my eyes when I heard the sound of gunfire. I happily ran outside to see, but there was nothing. I came back, my heart pounding, and couldn't sleep all night. The second night, before I fell asleep, the guns were firing again. I went out to listen, and machine guns and grenades were going off all around. The blockhouse in Wu Wang was also on fire! I was so happy, the savior had come! I couldn't wait to shout and fly over there, but those dogs were patrolling the streets, so I didn't dare to go. Later, the gunfire stopped, but our troops still hadn't come. I disappointedly returned to my room, thinking that tonight they'll attack Wu Wang, and tomorrow they'll attack our village."
    Yesterday, when we were approaching Xixia Han, it was exactly when the old woman was pacing and waiting for us. The sound of our first grenade exploding was not terrifying to the old woman. When our machine guns and grenades and bugle calls were mixed together, the old woman laughed in her heart. She ran to the street and saw our soldiers, shouting, "Heavens! You've come!" We urged her to go back, fearing that she would be hit by gunfire, but she said she wasn't afraid, and she had to bite Gao Wan Guo a few times. Only after the soldiers repeatedly persuaded her did she go back.
    The enemy was annihilated by us, the prison was opened by us, and the liberated farmers regained their freedom. Today, this old woman in her forties is looking for her husband who was rescued by us, so she is shedding tears of gratitude.
    Note: "Human headstand" means burying someone alive headfirst.

　　“救命恩人来了！”
    曹静四
    我正和其他的同志谈论着昨晚的战斗，忽听得街上乱哄哄的，我出来见一群战士围着一个四十多岁的老太太，她像疯子似的又哭又说：“老天爷！老天爷！救命恩人呀！”说着她拉住一个战士的手，目不转睛的盯着，一句话也不说，只是眼泪不住的往下流，很久才说：“拴！你在这里。”她索性大哭起来。
    李拴也是西夏寒人，和她男人曾经在一个地主家作过活，在一辆大车上要过鞭子，八路军到这里以后，李拴脱离了他的觅汉生活，加入队伍，他的伙伴也加入了农会，各自走上不同的光明前程。今天相遇，使她抑制不住自己的眼泪直流。
    敌人占了西夏寒，什么“还乡队”“复仇队”都回来了，他们抓住李拴的伙伴，也抓住了像李拴伙伴一样的农民，都关在一所小屋子里，“还乡团”的地主用狰狞的眼睛盯着他们，从吃过人的血嘴里喷出：“你们仗着工作员就坏了良心，又是清债，又是算账，你们清吧！算吧！咱看谁算了谁，你算我账，我就算你的命，今天要给你们个‘倒栽葱’。”
    她擦了擦眼泪，对他说：“狗＠的占了咱村；我就盼望咱八路军来打。他（老汉）叫扣起之后我更盼得着急，前些日子的一个黑夜里，才合上眼，听着砰砰的枪响，我高兴的跑到外面去看，结果什么也没有，我回来心跳的一夜没睡，第二夜还没睡，枪又在响，我出门一听，机关枪炸弹都响成一团，武旺的炮楼也着火了，我可高兴啦，这个救命人可来啦，恨不得叫一下飞到咱这里吧，但街上狗＠的放哨走来走去，我也不敢去，后来枪声不响了，但咱们部队还没来。我失望的回到房里，心想今天黑夜打武旺，明天就要打咱村了。”
    咋天，我们下夏寒，接近村子的时候，也正是老太太徘徊盼望我们的时候。我们第一颗手榴弹炸裂的声音对老太太不是恐怖，我们的机枪和手榴弹冲锋号搅成一片的时候，老太太的心里却笑了，他跑到街上见到我们的战士大声说：“天呀！你们来了。”我们劝她回去，怕枪打伤了她，她说不怕，我非咬高万国几口不行。经过战士再三的劝说，她才回去。
    敌人被我们消灭了，囚牢被我们打开了，翻了身的农民又重新得到了天日，今天，这个四十多岁的老太太正是找她那被我们拯救了的丈夫，所以感激的掉下眼泪。
    注：“倒栽葱”即把头朝下活埋的意思。
