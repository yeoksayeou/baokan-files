　　She County Higher Primary Schools
    Launch School Construction Movement
    Xiangyuan Normal School and Fourth Higher Primary School Expel Bad Teacher Fu Hailong
    [From our Changzhi correspondent] In order to implement the new educational policy of closely integrating learning with application, higher primary schools in She County have launched a school construction movement. The content includes: 1. Implementing the teaching policy of "improving students' culture through production knowledge"; 2. Developing production and establishing school housekeeping to achieve self-sufficiency in public expenses, gradually replenishing books, increasing school equipment, and establishing students' labor concept; 3. Improving school organization, enriching class quotas, and achieving democracy and unity throughout the school; 4. Enriching teaching content and participating in practical social activities, such as current affairs propaganda; and closely connecting schools with the masses. Each higher primary school will also compete with each other to strive for models. The movement is scheduled to be summarized after the autumn of next year. In addition: Jingdian Town Branch of the Second Higher Primary School in the county has implemented production education, and has begun teaching students weaving, printing, etc., which both teachers and students are interested in.

    [From our Xiangyuan correspondent] Students of Xiangyuan Normal School and Fourth Higher Primary School recently petitioned the government to replace teacher Fu Hailong, who refused to repent and reform, and the government has approved the petition and dismissed Fu for investigation. After the Japanese invaders occupied Xiangyuan, Fu Hailong served as the branch president of the puppet Xinminhui and the principal of the puppet No. 1 High School. He forced students to join his traitorous organizations such as "Xinminhui" and "Youth Communist Extermination Corps"; those who did not join were accused of colluding with the Eighth Route Army. He also brutally murdered the anti-Japanese teacher Zhao Chengbi and raped Zhao Taohai, the younger sister of student Zhao Juwen. After Xiangyuan was liberated, the democratic government, considering his more than ten years of teaching experience, adopted a lenient policy and hired him as a teacher at the Fourth Higher Primary School, giving him an opportunity to rehabilitate himself. However, Fu's treacherous heart did not die, and he colluded with Yan Xishan's special agent Yao Zong, stole secret documents from our county government, and handed them over to Yan's special service agency. He openly opposed democracy in front of students and slandered mass movements. Teachers and students of the Normal School and Fourth Higher Primary School repeatedly advised him to repent and reform, and be a good person again, but he used the excuse that the government should cherish intellectuals, resisted shamelessly, and stubbornly persisted to the end. Students of the two schools could no longer tolerate it, so they resolutely struggled and petitioned the government to remove Fu Hailong from the school. The government accepted the students' opinions and has dismissed Fu for investigation.

　　涉县各高小
    掀起建校运动
    襄垣简师四高清除坏教员傅海龙
    【本报长治讯】为贯彻学与用密切结合的新教育方针，涉县各高小掀起建校运动，其内容为：一、贯彻“通过生产知识，提高学生文化”的教学方针；二、发展生产，建立学校家务，做到公费自给，并逐渐充实图书，增加校具，树立学生劳动观念；三、健全学校组织，充实班次名额，并做到全校民主团结；四、充实教学内容，参加社会实际活动，如时事宣传等；密切学校与群众关系。各高小并互相竞赛，争取模范，运动定明年秋后总结。又：该县二高井店镇分校已实施生产教育，开始教学生织布、印刷等，师生均感兴趣。（赵正谊）
    【本报襄垣讯】襄垣简师与四高学生顷呈请政府撤换不肯改过自新的教员傅海龙，已获政府批准，并将傅撤职查办。傅海龙自日寇占领襄垣后，即任伪新民会分会长、伪一高校长。强迫学生加入其汉奸组织“新民会”，“青少灭共团”等；不加入者即以私通八路论罪。并残杀了抗日教员赵承壁，强奸学生赵居文之妹赵桃孩。襄垣解放后，民主政府念其执教十余年，一本宽大政策，聘其为四高教员，予以自新机会。讵傅贼心不死，竟与阎特高耀宗勾结，偷去我县府秘密文件，授予阎之特务机关，在学生面前公然反对民主，污蔑群运。简师、四高学生一再劝他改过自新，重做好人，他却借口政府应爱护知识分子，无耻抗拒，顽固到底。两校学生忍无可忍，乃起而坚决斗争，并呈请政府清除傅海龙出校。政府接受同学意见，已将傅撤职查办。
