　　Resolutely Support Farmers' Demands
    Initial Success in Land Reform in Qingfeng
    Farmers Receive Two to Three Mu of Land Each
    [Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 24th] After three weeks of intense mass liquidation struggles, the land reform in Qingfeng County has achieved considerable success. Over six hundred villages in the county have initially realized "land to the tiller." The 40,889 mu of land seized by the treacherous landlords has now been returned to the farmers (land in lieu of death is not calculated). Each farmer in the county has received two to three mu of land, while families of military personnel and martyrs have received three to five mu. Over 70% of the masses have been organized in the struggle. The scale of this movement exceeds any previous one, and the masses' enthusiasm is also higher than ever before. They universally reflect: "Several years of struggle have not been as thorough as this one!" The movement has overcome the tendency of some cadres to belittle or ignore the farmers' land issues, as well as the erroneous idea that "land to the tiller cannot be achieved without taking from the middle peasants." The slogan of "poor and middle peasants unite to settle accounts with treacherous landlords" united the broad masses of farmers, forcing the treacherous landlords to bow their heads, admit their mistakes, and compensate the farmers for their losses. According to the county's preliminary summary, the experiences in leading this movement are as follows: 1. Cadres at all levels, from the village to the district level and above, should show the masses that they resolutely support the masses' struggle and land demands, so that the masses thoroughly trust us. At the same time, they should go deep into the masses to enlighten their awareness, develop organizations such as farmers' associations, and absorb the broad masses to participate in the movement, overcoming organizational exclusivism. The slogan "strength yields results" should be put forward.
    2. When the movement reaches its climax, some middle and rich peasants who do not understand our policies may become alarmed or voluntarily offer their land. At this time, the slogan "all farmers under heaven are one family" should be used to educate all farmers, expose the rumors and provocations of saboteurs, and unite internally. 3. When distributing the fruits of struggle, especially when dividing the land, democratic discussion should be implemented to obtain the sympathy and satisfaction of the majority of the masses. In addition, the work of summarizing and consolidating should be done well to ensure the normal development of the movement. (1) Each system should hold a membership meeting to summarize the achievements, shortcomings, and reasons for the movement. Strengthen education and encourage everyone to make persistent efforts to implement "land to the tiller." (2) Convene a meeting of households that have obtained land to clarify the reasons for obtaining the land, and call on everyone to produce well. (3) Convene a meeting of military families to call for plans to become prosperous, and organize mutual-aid farming well. (4) Convene a meeting of households that have offered land to commend their enlightenment and call on them to produce peacefully. (5) The objects of struggle should be educated separately, pointing out their past mistakes so that they understand that as long as they implement laws and regulations and obey the masses, they can still receive the care of the masses. (6) Finally, convene a village-wide mass unity and victory meeting, proposing that in the future, we must unite well, produce, help each other, solve difficulties, and live a good life. However, necessary struggles must still be carried out against those who are still plotting sabotage.

　　坚决支持农民要求
    清丰土地改革初告成功
    农民每人获地二亩至三亩
    【本报冀鲁豫廿四日电】经过三周来猛烈的群众清算斗争，清丰县的土地改革已获不小成绩。全县六百余村，已初步实现了耕者有其田。奸霸地主们掠夺农民的四万零八百八十九亩土地，现已复归农民所有（死当地未算）。全县农民，每人均已获得二亩至三亩土地，军工属则获三亩至五亩。在斗争中组织群众达百分之七十以上。此次运动之规模，超过以往任何一次，群众情绪，亦较已往任何时期为高，他们普遍反映：“斗争了好几年，都赶不上这一次彻底！”运动中曾克服了部分干部轻视与忽视农民土地问题的倾向，与“非从中农身上想办法不能实现耕者有其田”的错误论点。以“中贫农联合向奸霸地主清算”的口号团结了广大农民，使奸霸地主不能不低头认错并赔偿农民所受损失。据该县初步总结，此次领导运动的经验有以下几点：一、从村到区以上各级干部，都应向群众表明自己坚决支持群众斗争与土地要求，使群众彻底信赖我们，同时要深入到群众中去启发群众觉悟，发展农会等组织，吸收广大群众参加运动，克服组织上的关门主义。提出“有力量才有果实”的口号。
    二、运动达到高潮时，部分中富农不了解我之政策，会发生惊慌，或自动献地。此时应以“天下农民是一家”的口号教育所有农民，揭破坏分子的造谣挑拨，以团结内部。三、分配斗争果实，特别是分土地时，应实行民主讨论，取得多数群众同情与满意。此外，应做好总结、巩固工作，以保证运动的正常发展。（１）各系统开会员大会，总结运动之成绩、缺点、原因等。加强教育，鼓舞大家再接再厉，贯彻实现耕者有其田。（２）召开得到土地的户的会，弄清得到土地的原因，号召大家好好生产。（３）召开军属会，号召作发家打算，并把代耕组织好。（４）召开献地户的会，表扬他们的开明，并号召其安心生产。（５）对斗争对象要分别教育，指出他们过去的错误使他们了解只要执行法令，服从群众，仍能获得群众照顾。（６）最后召开全村群众团结胜利大会，提出今后要好好团结生产，互相帮助，解决困难，把日子过好。但对仍在阴谋破坏者，则仍须进行必要的斗争。
