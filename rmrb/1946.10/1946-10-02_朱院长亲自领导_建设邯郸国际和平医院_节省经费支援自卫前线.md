　　Dean Zhu Personally Leads
    Construction of Handan International Peace Hospital
    Saving Funds to Support the Self-Defense Front
    [Handan News, this paper] The Handan International Peace Hospital originally planned to start outpatient services in early July and admit patients in August. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries provoked a full-scale civil war, affecting the construction of the hospital. Recently, the Border Government decided to merge the original Border Region Health Bureau with the hospital organization, strengthening its forces. Thus, on September 1st, it was officially reorganized as the "Handan Bethune International Peace Hospital," with Zhu Lian, the original director of the Border Region Health Bureau, serving as the dean. Currently, due to a few unfinished patient rooms and a sudden increase in the number of people requesting hospitalization, even from places like Xiangyuan in Shanxi and Shexian in Henan, the housing facilities are in short supply. Although the 10 million yuan in construction funds originally allocated by the government has been returned to support the patriotic self-defense war, the responsible cadres of the hospital are determined to adopt the principle of "workers as teachers, and we also do it ourselves" to gradually build the hospital. From the dean to all staff members, it is stipulated that, without hindering medical treatment, they will collectively participate in labor from 1:00 to 3:00 pm every day. In recent days, they have started to carry bricks, carry soil, level the ground, and lay the foundation. The planned first step is to establish an obstetrics and gynecology department by the end of this year, accommodating 60 patients; the second step is to establish internal medicine and surgery departments next spring, accommodating 40 patients; and the third step is to establish a pediatrics department, with a total of 200 patients by the summer. According to Dean Zhu, the full realization or early realization of this plan still requires strong support from the government and all parties.
    [Another News] The Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, upon hearing of the initial establishment of the Handan International Peace Hospital, recently sent Comrades Miao Yizheng and Qu Zhiquan to take multiple photos of the hospital; and plans to capture the entire process of the hospital from its simple beginnings to a more concrete scale in a series of photographs.

　　朱院长亲自领导
    建设邯郸国际和平医院
    节省经费支援自卫前线
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸国际和平医院，原拟于七月初开始门诊，八月间收容病人，因国民党反动派挑动全面内战，影响医院建筑。近边府决定：原边区卫生局与医院机构归并，充实力量，遂于九月一日正式改组为“邯郸白求恩国际和平医院”，由原边区卫生局朱琏局长担任院长。现因尚有少数未竣工的病室，而要求住院人数骤增，甚至有自山西襄垣、河南涉县等地前来看病，因之住房设备供不应求，原由政府拨给的建筑费一千万元，虽已交还用于支援爱国自卫战争，但该院负责干部仍决心采用“工人作导师，自己也动手”的方针，逐步建筑。由院长直到所有工作人员，规定：在不妨碍诊病的原则下，每日下午一至三时，集体参加劳动。连日来已着手抬砖、抬土、平地、奠基等工作。预定计划第一步：今年年内先设妇产科部，收容六十名；第二步：明年春天设内外科部，收容四十名；第三步：设小儿科部，入夏共可收到二百名。据朱院长谈：这个计划要全部实现或提早实现，尚须政府与各方面大力帮助。
    【又讯】晋冀鲁豫军区政治部，闻邯郸国际和平医院创办伊始，特于日前派苗毅征、曲治全二同志至该院照相多幅；并拟将该院从简陋到较具体规模的全部过程，摄成连环照片。（肖健）
