　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th. Various areas of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region are busily engaged in harvesting and planting. In Huailai and Yanqing counties in eastern Chahar, more than one million mu of fields had been harvested and fortified before the Chiang Kai-shek troops' offensive. In areas invaded and occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, farmers mostly filled wells, emptied pots, and their entire families entered the mountain and forest areas to persist in guerrilla warfare. An old man in Kangzhuang said with optimism before leaving home: "Not a single grain or blade of grass is left in the fields and threshing grounds. As long as the farmers have people and food, it will be fine. We will return home to rebuild our homes after defeating the reactionary army." In the plain areas west of the Ping-Han Railway, thousands of young, strong women are automatically replacing the families of militiamen who have gone to war in harvesting the autumn crops. More than 2,300 refugees who fled from areas invaded and occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in Zhengding have also organized armed harvesting teams to return to their hometowns to carry out guerrilla warfare and harvesting. While the masses in various parts of central Hebei are busy with the autumn harvest, they are also allocating a large number of laborers to assist the flood-stricken areas in repairing fields and planting autumn wheat. Hejian, Gao County, Renqiu, Anping and other counties have rushed to repair 13 sections of dikes at various breaches of the Hutuo River, restoring more than 148,000 mu of wheat fields. The more than 100,000 mu of fertile land destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops digging up the dikes of the southern Grand Canal have all been rescued by the masses opening canals and diverting water. The local democratic government has provided loans of 45,000 jin of wheat seeds to help the victims expand their wheat fields.

　　晋察冀抢收忙
    蒋伪军侵陷区坚壁一空群众进入山林坚持游击
    【新华社张家口十日电】晋察冀各地紧张抢收抢种，察哈尔东部怀来延庆两县在蒋军进攻前，一百余万亩田即已收割坚壁完毕，蒋军侵陷区，农民多纷纷填井拔锅，全家进入山林地带坚持游击战争。康庄一个老汉在离家前洋溢着乐观情绪对人说：“地里场上一颗粮一根草也没留下，庄稼汉有人有粮就行，打退反动军后再回家建立家务。”平汉线西侧平原地区，数千个青年壮年妇女，自动代替出征民兵家属收秋。由正定蒋伪军侵陷区逃出的二千三百多难胞，亦已组织武装收割队，返乡开展游击战争和抢收。冀中各地群众在忙着秋收中，并拨出大批劳动力协助水灾区整修田陇播种秋麦。河间、高县、任邱、安平等县已在滹沱河各决口处抢修固堤十三段，恢复麦田十四万八千余亩。蒋伪军掘开南运河河堤，所冲毁的十万余亩良田，经群众开渠运水已全部救出。当地民主政府放贷小麦种子四万五千斤，救济灾民扩大麦田。
