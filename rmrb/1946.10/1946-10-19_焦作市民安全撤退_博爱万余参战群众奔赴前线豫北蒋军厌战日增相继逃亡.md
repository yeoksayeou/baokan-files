Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 16th: When the Jiaozuo garrison troops transferred on the 12th, all 60,000 citizens of the city evacuated in an orderly manner. The old, weak, women, and children, carrying baskets and shoulder poles, safely transferred out of the city under the protection of the army. Businessmen said, "Under the rule of the 'Disaster Army' (referring to the 'Central Army'), we can't do any business!" They moved important materials one after another, evacuating with the army. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine Workers' Militia of more than 300 people and the militia company formed by liberated peasants are now actively cooperating with the Eighth Route Army to launch guerrilla warfare in the suburbs of the city. More than 14,000 people from the People's Self-Defense Forces and stretcher transport teams in Bo'ai and other counties have rushed to the outskirts of Jiaozuo to cooperate in annihilating the enemy.

This newspaper, Changzhi, 17th: As the civil war intensifies, Kuomintang soldiers are also increasingly weary of war. Recently, in order to prevent soldiers from deserting, the Kuomintang army has implemented a "joint responsibility system" in various units; however, soldiers are still constantly running away. On the 5th, Hao Houde, a soldier of the Second Company of a battalion of the 40th Division of the Kuomintang Army stationed in Da Nianshan, Anyang, fled to our area. At the beginning of the month, a squad stationed in Ende Fort Village belonging to Li Ying's unit of the Pseudo-Northern Henan Transportation Security Division in Qi County fled overnight, leaving only the squad leader and deputy squad leader. Later, the squad leader also fled in fear of punishment. On the 7th, Wang Zhankui, Tan Deyun, and Li Qingjiang, soldiers of the Fifth Company of the 96th Regiment of the Third Army of the Kuomintang Army in Huolu, also fled to the Liberated Area. They all carried leaflets distributed by our army and suggested that we distribute more of these leaflets, saying that if the Kuomintang soldiers knew that the Eighth Route Army welcomed them, they would all come over.

　　焦作市民安全撤退
    博爱万余参战群众奔赴前线豫北蒋军厌战日增相继逃亡
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十六日电】十二日焦作守军转移，全市六万市民均作有秩序的撤退。老弱妇孺提篮挑担，在军队掩护下向市外安全转移。商人们说：“遭殃军（指‘中央军’）统治，咱们没有买卖可做了！”纷纷搬运重要物资，随军撤退。焦作煤矿工人纠察队三百余人及翻身农民组成的民兵连，现均积极配合八路军在市郊展开游击战争。博爱等县人民自卫军及担架运输队一万四千余人，均奔赴焦作外围，配合歼灭敌人。
    【本报长治十七日电】内战日益扩大，蒋军士兵亦日益厌战。蒋军近来为防止士兵逃亡，各部队实行“连坐法”；可是，士兵仍不断逃跑。五日安阳蒋军四十师驻大碾山之一营二连士兵郝后德逃来我区。月初，淇县伪豫北交通警备师李英部驻恩德堡村之一个班，一夜间逃得仅剩正副班长二人，后班长惧罪亦相率逃亡。七日，获鹿蒋军第三军九十六团五连士兵王占奎、谭德云、李清江三人，亦逃来解放区。彼等均携有我军所散发之传单，并建议我方多散发这种传单，蒋军士兵若知道八路军欢迎他们，都会过来的。
