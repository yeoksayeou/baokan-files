Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Shanghai dispatch: Mr. Zhang Bojun, leader of the Third Party and Standing Committee member of the Democratic League, stated during an interview with a Xinmin Bao reporter on September 26th: "The 'American Troops Out of China Week,' this movement against war and for peace, should further develop in America, because the American people do not want their rulers to pursue a reckless, fire-playing policy." Mr. Zhang pointed out the justness of this movement, saying, "Our movement to resist Japan ten years ago was because Japan was oppressing us. Now, our demand for peace and democracy is equally important to the previous resistance against Japan. The development of this movement will surpass the anti-Japanese movement of that time. In this movement in China, even if 100,000 people are sacrificed, persecuted, killed, imprisoned, exiled, or detained, it is worth it. This can prevent China from becoming the world's battlefield." Mr. Zhang called on peace-loving people at home and abroad to immediately rise up and stop all warmongers' warmongering attempts.

    【新华社延安六日电】沪讯：第三党领袖民盟中常委章伯钧氏于九月二十六日接见新民报记者时谈称：“美军退出中国周”这种反对战争争取和平的运动，以后在美国更要发展，因为美国人民不愿他们的执政者推行一种玩火的冒险政策。章氏指出此运动的正义性说：“我们在十年前要求抗日的运动，是因为日本压迫我们，现在我们要求和平民主，与以前抗日是均等重要。这种运动的发展，是会超过当年的抗日运动的。中国在此运动中，就是牺牲十万人被迫害被杀或下狱放逐监禁都是值得的。这样可以使中国不致成为世界的战场。”章氏号召爱好和平的中外人士立即起来，制止一切好战分子的好战企图。
