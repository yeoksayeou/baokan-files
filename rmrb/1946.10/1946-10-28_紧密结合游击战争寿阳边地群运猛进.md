　　Closely Combine Guerrilla Warfare to Vigorously Advance Mass Movements in the Shouyang Border Area
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 26th] Since September, the mass movement in the Shouyang border area has rapidly entered a high tide with the help of the "turn-over" (翻身) teams. As of the end of September, 18 natural villages in the first district had carried out liquidation, with more than 1,700 peasants participating in the struggle, overthrowing 16 major despots who had colluded with the Japanese and puppet regimes in the past. In Hedi and Xiazhuang, more than 500 peasants jointly overthrew the major despot Wang Chongmin, and the peasants recovered their losses according to law. In the movement, the farmers' associations and militia have greatly developed. This district is close to the Zhengtai Railway, and most of the villages were liberated last year. However, due to frequent harassment by Yan's puppet troops and the leadership's lack of attention to the emancipation of the masses in the border area, rigidly applying the experience of the old liberated areas, and lacking concrete methods, the masses have not been fully mobilized in the past year. Before this movement, the leadership conducted a review, clarifying that the border area is different from the core area, and the emancipation movement must be closely combined with the struggle against the stubborn (阎锡山). The resounding slogan was put forward: "Without the victory of guerrilla warfare, the emancipation cannot be done well," and "Leading the masses to fight guerrilla warfare is the top priority of supporting the masses." After this, all villages first rectified the militia and made war preparations, and then started with anti-espionage, and then developed into anti-despot and rent and interest reduction struggles. Firmly grasping the principle of "small struggle front, large united front," the movement developed rapidly and vigorously without being chaotic, and the cadres' confidence was also greatly improved. The movement is now developing universally and deeply.

　　紧密结合游击战争寿阳边地群运猛进
    【本报长治二十六日电】九月以来，寿阳边地群运，在翻身队帮助下，迅速进入高潮。截至九月底，一区已有十八个自然村进行了清算，一千七百余农民参加了斗争，斗垮过去勾结日伪的大恶霸十六人，河底、下庄五百余农民联合斗垮大恶霸王重民，农民依法收回所受损失。运动中，农会、民兵有很大发展。该区紧靠正太路，大部村庄去年已获解放，由于阎伪军经常袭扰，与领导上对边地群众翻身重视不够，死搬老区经验，缺乏具体办法，致一年来群众未充分发动。这次运动之前，领导上经过检讨，明确了边地与腹心区不同，翻身运动必须与对顽斗争紧密结合，响亮提出：“没有游击战争的胜利，翻身就搞不好”，“领导群众打游击，就是给群众撑腰的头等事情”等口号后，各村都先整顿民兵，作了战争准备，后又从反特务入手，进而发展到反恶霸及减租减息斗争。紧紧掌握了“斗争面小，团结面大”的原则，所以运动发展既迅速又猛烈，也不紊乱，干部信心亦大为提高。现运动正向普遍深入发展。
