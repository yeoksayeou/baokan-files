　　Democratic Government's Rational Arrangement
    Quwo Transferred Masses Have Settled Down
    Determined to Follow the Eighth Route Army to Fight Back to Their Hometown!
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 19th dispatch] After the bandit Chiang occupied Quwo, the masses were safely transferred, and with the help of the democratic government and local masses, they have safely settled down. Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold, and some of the masses have difficulty changing their clothes for the season. The local government immediately called on cadres of various organs to promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses, and donated clothes. Currently, 66 pieces of clothing, handkerchiefs, socks, and Jichaos have been donated. They have already been distributed to poor families of military personnel and the masses. Other organs are continuing to collect donations. The government also made a guarantee to the refugees: "Not a single person will go hungry or freeze." Village cadres in the Third District responded to the government's call and helped refugees like Wang Fengzhang to specially organize a transportation cooperative for the refugees, absorbing 140 refugees, investing 140,000 yuan in shares, with each person's share worth 1,000 yuan, a mule worth two shares, and the accountant purchaser worth two shares. It is stipulated that livestock used for transportation will receive 10 catties of grass and 5 catties of feed per day, and people will receive 3 catties of flour a day. Returning to set up stalls to sell goods is worth half a share. From the beginning of transportation to now, in less than seven days, they have already earned more than 20,000 yuan in foreign currency. In order to meet the urgent need for refugees to change their clothes for the season, dividends were distributed immediately, with each share receiving a dividend of 183 yuan. This made the transferred masses happy and moved, saying: "Chairman Mao's methods are truly effective, the democratic government is truly our own people, we must follow the Eighth Route Army to drive back the stubborn troops and return to Quwo!"

    【本报阳城十九日电】蒋贼侵占曲沃，群众安全转移后，在民主政府及当地群众帮助下，已安全安了家。近来天气渐寒，部分群众换季困难，该地政府即号召各机关干部发扬与群众同甘共苦之精神，捐助衣服，现已捐出衣服六十六件，手巾、袜子、冀钞各一部；并已分配给贫寒军属及群众。其他机关正在继续募集中。政府并向难民提出：“不让一个人饿了肚，受了冻”的保证。三区村干部响应政府号召，帮助难民王奉璋等特为难民组织运轮合作社，吸收难民一百四十人，把贷款十四万元入股，在阳邑等地来回贩货，每人一千元顶一股，一个骡子顶两股，会计采办员顶两股，规定牲口出外运输每天发十斤草，五斤料，人一天三斤面，回来摆货摊卖货顶一半。从开始运输到现在不上七天，即已赚洋两万余元。为着难民急需换季，当下分红，每股批红一百八十三元。使转移群众都高兴与感动，说：“毛主席的办法真灵，民主政府真是自己人，咱们一定要跟八路军打退顽军，回到曲沃去！”
