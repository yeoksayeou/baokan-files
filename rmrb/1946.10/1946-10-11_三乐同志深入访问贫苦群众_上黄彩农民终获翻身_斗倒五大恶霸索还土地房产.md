　　Comrade Sanle Pays In-Depth Visits to Impoverished Masses
　　Farmers of Shanghuangcai Finally Achieve Liberation
　　Overthrow Five Local Tyrants and Reclaim Land and Property
　　[Reported by our newspaper from Changzhi, 9th] Shanghuangcai Village, one of the backward villages in Yuci, has launched another struggle for liberation under the leadership of District Political Commissar Hao Sanle, and has initially realized "land to the tiller." This village launched two movements for liberation this year, but neither solved the problem. Most of the masses had thoughts of things changing and dared not approach the district cadres. The district cadres all said that the masses of Shanghuangcai were difficult to mobilize. Recently, District Political Commissar Comrade Hao Sanle came to work in the village. He did not adopt the method of holding a general meeting as soon as he arrived, but first went to the impoverished people to conduct in-depth visits. He went to the home of the poor old widow Ma ×. Comrade Hao lived and ate the same as the common people and was extremely kind in his attitude. He chatted with the old woman about everyday matters and told her in detail about his past experiences of being oppressed by landlords. The old woman sighed and said, "Alas! As miserable as me!" Comrade Sanle asked her what her difficulties were, and she cried and said, "I am from Shaanxi. At seventeen, I was sold here to be the concubine of the second brother of the landlord Wang Baoquan. A few years ago, my husband died, and Wang Baoquan treated me like livestock, giving me nothing and often beating and scolding me. This spring, when we started the liberation movement, I thought I could finally vent my anger, but Wang Baoquan scared the villagers. Who dared to rebel?" Sanle then visited the poor peasant Ran Ming and saw his wife holding a child, preparing to beg for food. Comrade Sanle exchanged his own rice coupons for fifteen taels of millet and personally delivered it to her home. As they chatted, she told him all about how she was extorted, swindled, and oppressed by the local tyrant landlord Wang Baoquan until she went bankrupt. Sanle later chatted with village deputy Fan Danze and learned that the poor people all wanted to be liberated, but there was no one to take the lead. After visiting many places and gaining a deep understanding of the village's situation, Comrade Sanle convened the farmers' association, mobilized people to recount their sufferings, and inspired the masses to take action themselves, while making it clear that he would definitely help everyone to see it through to the end. The masses became bolder, and most people unanimously and enthusiastically demanded struggle. As a result, a series of fierce struggles unfolded, and the five major local tyrants, including Wang Baoquan, were overthrown by the masses. The land, houses, and property they had seized were all returned. The masses won the victory of liberation. When distributing the spoils, they offered Comrade Sanle a quilt, but he politely declined. The masses praised him even more, saying, "The Communist Party is truly devoted to us!"

　　三乐同志深入访问贫苦群众
    上黄彩农民终获翻身
    斗倒五大恶霸索还土地房产
    【本报长治九日电】榆次落后村之一——上黄彩村，在区政委郝三乐领导下再度掀起翻身斗争，已初步实现耕者有其田。该村今年两度掀起翻身运动，都没有解决问题。大部群众都有变天思想，不敢接近区干部。区干部都说上黄彩群众就是难发动。最近区政委郝三乐同志到该村工作，他没有采取一到就开大会的方式，而先到贫苦老百姓中深入访问。他到了贫苦老寡妇马×家，郝同志吃的穿的都和老百姓一样，态度至为和气，和这位老年人谈家常事，把自己过去受地主压迫的情形详细谈给她听，老人叹气说：“唉！跟俺一样苦！”三乐同志问她有什么苦处，她哭着说：“俺是陕西人，十七岁卖到这里给地主王保全的二哥当小老婆；前几年男人死去，王保全就把我当成畜牲，啥都不给，还时常挨打受骂。今年春天闹翻身，我想可以出出气啦，可是王保全把村上人吓唬住了，谁敢翻身呢？”三乐又去拜访贫农冉明，见他女人抱着小孩正准备去讨饭。三乐同志就以自己的米票兑了十五两小米，亲自送到她家，闲扯起来，她就把被恶霸地主王保全敲诈欺压而破产的情形诉了个尽。三乐后来和村副范旦则闲谈，更知道了穷苦人都想翻身，就是没人作主。三乐同志再到许多地方访问，深悉该村情况后，即召开农会，发动诉苦，启发群众自己起来干，并表明自己一定帮助大家干到底。群众胆大了，多数人都一致热烈要求斗争。于是，连续数次的猛烈斗争展开了，王保全等五家大恶霸被群众斗倒了，霸占去的房地财物也全部退出。群众翻身胜利了，分果实时送三乐同志一条被子，他婉言谢绝了。群众更加赞佩说：“共产党真是赤心为咱啊！”
