　　Havana "Hoy" reports: Chinese organizations are assisting Luis (transliteration), chairman of the "National League for a Democratic China," who published a statement in the newspaper condemning the United States' continued military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek Nationalist government. Mr. Lu represents 75,000 overseas Chinese in Cuba, appealing to Cuban progressive groups and individuals to urge Truman to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China.
　　United Press reports: The U.S.'s reluctance to return the military bases it seized in Panama has caused widespread opposition in that country. The Panamanian government submitted a note to the U.S. Ambassador Sains on the 19th, firmly demanding that the United States return the wartime bases within Panama.
　　Associated Press, Bucharest: A government gazette states that, in view of Romania's food situation, the Soviet government has exempted Romania from all grain payments for reparations for 1946-1947. Note: The Soviet Union exempted Romania from grain payments last year as well.
　　Associated Press and United Press, Shanghai: Archbishop Viktor, a Soviet citizen and head of the Russian Orthodox Church, was arrested today by Nationalist police. The police stated that they were acting on instructions from the National Defense Ministry in Nanjing but refused to state the reason for the arrest. This incident has caused excitement among the 25,000 Soviet expatriates in Shanghai. The Soviet Consulate here considers the matter very serious and has lodged a protest with the Nationalist authorities.
