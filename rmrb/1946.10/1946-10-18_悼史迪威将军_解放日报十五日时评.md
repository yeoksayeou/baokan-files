　　In Memoriam of General Stilwell
    A Commentary from the *Liberation Daily* on the 15th
    We were shocked to learn of the passing of General Stilwell, and all democratic Chinese people express their deep sorrow and condolences!
    General Stilwell was appointed by the late President Roosevelt as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the China-Burma-India Theater and also served as Chief of Staff of the China Theater. During his term of two years and eight months (from March 1942 to October 1944), he made great contributions to China's war of resistance and the establishment of sincere friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. He was a true executor of Roosevelt's policies. He participated in the heroic battles against the Japanese invaders on the India-Burma battlefield. Regarding domestic Chinese issues, he maintained a stern and neutral attitude, repeatedly urging Chiang Kai-shek to cooperate with other Chinese armies in resisting Japan, insisting on internal Chinese unity, reorganizing the corrupt Kuomintang government, and providing equal aid to both the Kuomintang and the Communist parties (he once said, "There should be no difference between the Communist army and Chiang's army") in order to rapidly strengthen the war against Japan and completely eliminate the Japanese fascist disaster.
    However, Stilwell's just proposition was resented and opposed by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, which at that time adopted a policy of passive resistance against Japan and active anti-communism. Initially, they sabotaged and hindered Stilwell's military command and deployment, refusing to give him full power to command troops, and failing to provide him with necessary transportation and supplies. Then, they became enraged and submitted an ultimatum-like request to the then-American government, indicating that Stilwell must be recalled. Coupled with the active support of the American imperialist element Hurley, this just general was forced to be squeezed out of China. This shows how deeply the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique hated fair-minded American friends who firmly advocated Chinese unity against Japan. Stilwell's forced removal created an unnecessary scar on the friendship between the two great nations of China and the United States, which is extremely regrettable!
    Only one year after the victory in the war against Japan, the Chinese reactionaries ignited the flames of full-scale rupture and full-scale civil war, which is a direct result of the current U.S. ruling authorities violating Roosevelt's policies and implementing the policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war. As Stilwell said in January of this year: "If the United States tells Chiang today that we will not help you, this guy won't be able to go far before he has to stop." If Stilwell's proposition could be accepted and implemented, and if the "special envoys" and "ambassadors" sent by the United States could all maintain a truly impartial attitude like Stilwell, then perhaps the current situation in China and Sino-American relations would not have evolved to this point.
    As we mourn the passing of General Stilwell, we cannot help but be filled with increased remembrance and sorrow for the death of this conscientious American great man! The facts of the past two years prove that only through the joint efforts of the Chinese and American people to restore Roosevelt's policies and follow Stilwell's path can Chiang Kai-shek's civil war dictatorship be stopped and Sino-American friendship develop normally.

### 悼史迪威将军  解放日报十五日时评

　　悼史迪威将军
    解放日报十五日时评
    惊闻史迪威将军病逝噩耗，一切民主的中国人民都深表沉痛的哀悼！
    史迪威将军曾为故罗斯福总统委为中缅印战区美军总司令，并兼中国战区参谋长之职，在其两年另八个月（自一九四二年三月至四四年十月）的任期内，曾对中国的抗战事业与中美两国人民真诚友谊的建立有过很大的功绩。他是罗斯福政策的真正执行人，曾在印缅战场时参与组织了对日寇的英勇战斗。而对中国国内问题，抱着严正与中立态度，一再要求蒋介石与其他中国军队合作抗日，坚持中国内部团结，改组腐败的国民党政府，予国共双方以平行的援助（他曾说“中共军与蒋军应该是没有什么区别的），以便迅速加强对日作战，彻底消灭日本法西斯灾祸。
    但是，史氏这种公正的主张，却遭受到当时即采取消极抗战而积极反共的蒋介石反动集团的忌恨与反对，初则对史氏的军事指挥与部署进行破坏与阻碍，不给他指挥作战军队的充分权力，不供给他必要的运输工具与给养，进而竟老羞成怒地向当时的美国政府提出了哀的美敦书式的要求，示意史迪威必须撤回；加之美帝国主义分子赫尔利的积极赞助，使这一位抱着正义感的将军，不得不从中国被排挤出去。这说明了蒋介石反动集团对于坚主中国团结抗日的公正的美国朋友，曾是如何深恶痛绝。史迪威的被迫去职，在中美两大民族的友谊上造成一种不应有的伤痕，这是极可惋惜的事！
    在对日战争胜利后仅仅一年，中国反动派竟挑起了全面破裂、全面内战的烈火，这正是今日的美国执政当局违背罗斯福政策、执行援蒋内战政策的直接结果。恰如史迪威今年一月所说：“如果美国今天向蒋说我们不援助你们，蒋这家伙就走不得几步便得停下来。”假若史氏这种主张能被接受和贯彻，美国派来的“特使”“大使”都能如史迪威那样抱持真正大公无私的态度，那么今天中国局势和中美关系或许不至于演变到这般地步。
    当我们在痛悼史迪威将军病逝之余，不能不使我们对这位有良心的美国伟人之死，弥增忆念与哀思！将近两年的事实，证明只有中美人民共同努力，使美国恢复罗斯福政策，遵循史迪威道路，蒋介石的内战独裁才能停止，才能使中美友谊得到正常的发展。
