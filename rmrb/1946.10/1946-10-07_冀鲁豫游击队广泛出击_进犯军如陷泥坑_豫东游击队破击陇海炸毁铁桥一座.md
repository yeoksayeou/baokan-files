[This article was] transmitted by our Ji-Lu-Yu Front on the 4th. In order to cooperate with our main force in annihilating the Chiang troops invading our hinterland, the Ji-Lu-Yu local army and militia guerrilla forces are now attacking and harassing the invading troops everywhere, intercepting Chiang's military transport, and launching sabotage warfare on the Longhai and other lines. On the 5th of last month, a local army regiment of ours dispersed a part of the Chiang army's 41st Division near Xietan, Kaocheng, seized a car, and 300 rounds of mortar shells. On the 7th, the Kaocheng militia self-defense team, in coordination with the independent battalion, raided the Chiang troops on both sides of Laohe, seized a radio station, six light and heavy machine guns, three rifles, and six mules. On the 8th, they raided again, capturing another light machine gun, more than a thousand rounds of ammunition, and capturing alive fifty members of Chiang Kai-shek's local team. On the 21st, the Yutai County guerrilla battalion retaliated against the invading Chiang Kai-shek special agent armed "Ganzihui", capturing twenty-five alive. On the 23rd, 25th, and 26th, a part of the local armed forces of Minquan and Kaocheng suddenly attacked near Weiwan, annihilating Chiang's transportation team, killing and capturing 32 Chiang soldiers, seizing more than 30 rifles, and more than 30,000 catties of wheat and soybeans. On the 25th, the Dangshan Brigade destroyed the district office presided over by Chiang's special agents, repelled more than a hundred Chiang troops, and killed fifteen Chiang soldiers. On the 26th, the Dangshan County Brigade cooperated with a friendly neighboring unit to raid a part of the Chiang Army Security Regiment southwest of Fengxian County, killing and wounding more than 40 people. The invading army abandoned nineteen corpses and fled in embarrassment. On the 27th, the Qibin (newly built county, located between Kaocheng and Caoxian) local army completely annihilated a Chiang army transport unit that was in transit, captured thirteen people alive, and seized four large carts full of cotton. On the same day, the Kaocheng County Brigade ambushed Dazhai, killing more than 20 Chiang soldiers and seizing more than 10 rifles. On the 28th, the Minquan County local armed forces patrolled Chiang's military transport line, intercepted three large carts of wheat and more than 500 bombs. On the 29th, a part of the Chiang army that had occupied Jinxiang advanced north along the Jin (xiang) Ji highway, and was intercepted by our guerrilla forces along the line. The Chiang army abandoned three large carts full of military supplies and fled in embarrassment. In total, in eleven days, our Ji-Lu-Yu local armed forces and militia guerrilla forces killed, wounded, and captured 220 Chiang soldiers (about two companies), seized one car, one radio station, seven light and heavy machine guns, 46 long and short guns, 800 rounds of artillery shells, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, 30,000 catties of grain, and twelve large carts full of military supplies (enough equipment for two combat platoons, one transportation team, and one regimental headquarters). During this period, the guerrilla corps of Shanxian and Jinxiang completely destroyed the Zhengqiao Bridge on the Cheng (wu) Shan (xian) Highway, the Jishu Bridge on the Shan (xian) Jin (xiang) Highway, and several bridges in Xiguan, Jinxiang, delaying Chiang's military transportation. On the 27th of last month, a guerrilla unit in eastern Henan launched sabotage warfare on the Longhai Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's lifeline for the civil war, and destroyed a section of the railway (about five li) between Lanfeng and Luowang East Station, and blew up a railway bridge, causing a train full of ammunition and other materials from Kaifeng to derail. All the items used by Chiang Kai-shek to expand the civil war were seized by us, including a radio station, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 2.4 million yuan in legal tender, and many other daily necessities. It is not difficult to imagine the embarrassing situation of Chiang's army's slow progress and increasingly falling into the inextricable quagmire of our liberated areas' military and civilian guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare.
