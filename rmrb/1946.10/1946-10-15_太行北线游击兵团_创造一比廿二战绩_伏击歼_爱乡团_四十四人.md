　　Taihang Northern Line Guerrilla Corps
    Creates a Victory Ratio of 1 to 22
    Ambush Annihilates 44 "Love-the-Homeland Corps" Members
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 13th dispatch] On the northern front of Taihang, our guerrilla corps has again created an exemplary battle case with a ratio of one to twenty-two. On the morning of the 9th, over 200 members of Yan's special armed "Love-the-Homeland Corps" stationed in Xinglin Village, east of Taigu City, attacked Yangyi Town. Their vanguard unit was ambushed by our guerrilla forces between Dongguoli and Yangyi, resulting in over 30 enemy killed or wounded, and 14 captured. We seized one machine gun, one grenade launcher, 11 rifles, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Our casualties were only one killed and one wounded. The following enemy forces fled upon hearing the news. Furthermore, over 300 members of Yan's puppet 9th Column stationed in Dongguan Town and Nantuanbai besieged a squad of our guerrilla team stationed in Zhongliang Village on the 6th. As a result, with the assistance of all the men, women, and children in the village, they persisted until our reinforcements arrived and repelled the Yan's puppet troops, killing over ten including their company commander and platoon leader. We suffered no casualties.
    [Another dispatch] Taihang's summary of the results of the self-defense guerrilla warfare in September is as follows: 114 battles of various sizes, capturing 4 strongholds, destroying 27 bunkers, killing, wounding, and capturing 504 enemy and puppet troops below the rank of company commander, seizing 2 mortars, 8 small cannons and grenade launchers, 5 light machine guns, 1 submachine gun, 121 rifles and carbines, over 16,000 rounds of various ammunition, destroying 8 railway bridges and a section of railway.
