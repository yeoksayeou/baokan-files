　　The Brilliance of the Pen
    Yujia
    Mr. Lu Xun's pen once pierced the hypocrisy of history, once wounded the dignity of new and old emperors, once depicted the epitome of Chinese humanity, and also once praised the new generation and future things. His pen was brilliant. The main reason why his pen could exert such great power was that he stood on the side of the people from beginning to end, singing for the people, weeping for the people, shouting for the people, and fighting for the people. Chairman Mao once quoted a sentence from Mr. Lu Xun: "Fiercely browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers; head bowed, I willingly serve as an ox for the children," to advise literary and art workers that they should become elementary school students of the common people. Mr. Lu Xun himself was the most exemplary apprentice of the people. He learned from the long-term workers in his family, from his "rural relatives," from rickshaw pullers, and also from thousands of Shanghai workers. He never felt that he was stronger than them. In "A Small Incident," didn't he also frankly reveal his own ugliness and insignificance? This spirit of humbly learning from others and strictly criticizing oneself is worthy of our inheritance and promotion.
    Today, when the American reactionaries and Chiang Kai-shek are frantically using all their strength to attack the people's home, the liberated areas, our pens should accelerate their activity, firing with high firepower like bullets, aiming at our enemies. We must inherit Lu Xun's pen, using our own clumsy, unskilled writing to write the historical traces of the people's heroic battles, to write the fearless spirit and irresistible power of the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party, to write the unity and sympathy of the people of the world, to write the shamelessness and poisoning of reactionaries at home and abroad, to write the mourning and funeral songs of autocratic dictators, to write the people's confidence in victory and triumphant songs. Write! It is the time for the pen to move freely. As long as your pen strives to create a people's century, it will emit great power and eternal brilliance.

　　笔的光辉
    羽嘉
    鲁迅先生的笔曾经戳穿了史篇的虚伪，曾经刺伤了新旧帝王的尊严，曾经刻画了中国人性的典型，也曾经歌诵了新的一代与未来的事物。他的笔是光辉的。他的笔之所以能发挥如此伟大的力量，主要的是由于他自始至终站在人民的立场，为人民讴歌，为人民哭泣，为人民呐喊，为人民战斗，毛主席曾经引用过鲁迅先生的一句话：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛。”来规劝过文艺工作者，应该去作老百姓的小学生，而鲁迅先生自己正是最模范的人民的学徒，他向他家的长工学习，向他的“乡下亲戚”学习，向黄包车夫学习，也向千百个上海工人学习；他从来不觉得自己比他们强，在“一件小事”里，他不是还坦白地揭露过自己的丑恶和渺小吗？这种谦虚的向别人学习和严格的自我批判精神，是值得我们承受与发扬的。
    今天，当美国反动派与蒋介石正疯狂地用一切力量向人民的家乡，——解放区进攻的时候，我们的笔应该加速地活动，像枪弹一样发射出高度的火力，对准我们的敌人，我们要继承鲁迅的笔，用我们自己粗笨的，不熟练的笔力，写出人民英勇战斗的史迹，写出八路军共产党大无畏的牺牲精神与不可抗拒的力量，写出全世界人民的团结与同情，写出国内外反动派的无耻与毒害，写出专制独裁者的哀鸣与葬歌，写出人民胜利的信心与凯曲，写吧！是笔尽情活动的时候，只要你的笔是为创造人民世纪而努力，它将发出伟大的力量与永恒的光辉。
