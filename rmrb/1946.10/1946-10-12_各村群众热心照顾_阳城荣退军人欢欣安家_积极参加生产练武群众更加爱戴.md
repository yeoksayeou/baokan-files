[This newspaper's] Yangcheng Dispatch, 9th: The villagers in various villages in the first district of Yangcheng are very enthusiastic and considerate in settling and caring for the returned veterans. From May to August, the district has resettled seventy-nine people. Among them, twenty-three have already married. 178 mu of land and 76 rooms have been distributed to them. In the resettlement process, many model village cadres emerged. The cadres of Xialiqiu Village voluntarily gave up brick and tile materials to Tian Sheng, a returned veteran, to repair his house. Liu Village helped returned veterans Zhang Desheng and Li Jin'an solve their marriage problems, absorbed them into the Farmers' Association and the Military Committee, and gave them more consideration when distributing the fruits of struggle, allocating 39 mu of good land to four returned veterans. Therefore, the relationship between the returned veterans and the masses is very close, helping and supporting the front lines. When the masses of Anyang Village went to the front to transport supplies, Comrade Li Fushou helped the masses with the autumn harvest in the village, and the masses were very grateful to him when they returned. Li Tongshun and Zhang Desheng of Xialiqiu joined the Farmers' Association to help the masses turn over, and are now cadres of the Military Committee, educating the militia to learn guerrilla warfare. The masses said, "As long as you can improve our village militia and protect the interests of the people, your difficulties will be easily solved." Ye Zhenqing of Nanqin Village is now the deputy director of the village Military Committee, leading the militia to cover the masses going to the front for transportation. Wang Chang'an of Pingtou Village planted one mu of garden land, participated in the mutual aid group, and did not want wages, so the people automatically mobilized thirty dan of manure for him and found land for him to plant wheat.

    【本报阳城九日电】阳城一区各村对荣退军人的安置照顾甚为热心周到，自五月至八月该区已安置了七十九人。其中并已有二十三人结婚者，已分配给他们土地一百七十八亩，房七十六间。在安置中曾出现许多模范村干部，下李邱村干部自动让出砖瓦材料给荣退军人田升修房子，刘村帮助荣退军人张德胜、李金安解决婚姻问题，吸收他们参加农会及武委会工作，分配斗争果实时多照顾他们，分配给四个荣退军人三十九亩好地，因此，荣退军人和群众关系非常密切，互相帮助支援前线。安阳村李福寿同志当群众上前方运输时，即在村帮助群众秋收，群众回来都非常感谢他。下李邱李通顺、张德胜二人更加入农会帮助群众翻身，现任武委会干部，教育民兵学习游击战。群众说：“只要能把咱村民兵搞好，保护老百姓翻身利益，你的困难都好解决。”南芹村叶振清现任村武委会副主任，带领民兵掩护群众去前方运输。坪头村王长安自种一亩园地，参加互助组，不要工钱，于是老百姓自动给他动员了三十担大粪，并找下地给他种麦。
