　　Military Supplies and Civilian Food Guaranteed
    Most Areas of Southern Hebei Achieve Bumper Harvest
    Over 370 Million Jin of Cotton and Grain Expected
    [Our newspaper's report from Weixian, dated 27th] A bumper autumn harvest is reported in most areas of southern Hebei. In the First District, nine counties and cities including Linqing, Yuanchao, Yongzhi, and Guantao, planted a total of 3,845,500 mu of autumn crops. Except for Guanxian and a portion of Wuxun, which were turned into "no-man's-land" by the enemy, and nine villages in Linqing affected by floods and experiencing reduced harvests, other areas are expected to yield 70 to 150 jin per mu. The yield in Linxi and the Longwangmiao area of Yuancheng exceeded previous years by one-third. It is estimated that the entire district will harvest 38.5 million jin of autumn grain. 726,000 mu were planted with cotton, and based on a minimum yield of 70 jin, a total of 50.8 million jin can be harvested. In the Second District, seven counties including Gucheng, Wucheng, Qinghe, and Enxian, planted a total of 4,104,760 mu of autumn crops. Some areas of Qinghe have a 120% yield, exceeding previous years by a factor of one. Due to assassinations and robberies by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Nationalist spies in En (county), Gao (tang), Xia (jin), and Ping (yuan) counties, production was delayed, and it is estimated that grain yields will be reduced by over 76 million jin. Based on general yields, the entire district is expected to harvest over 37 million jin of autumn grain and over 60.86 million jin of cotton. In the Third District, ten counties planted a total of 5,465,000 mu of autumn crops. Except for Yongnian and Jize counties, where the Nationalist planes bombed the Fuhe River dyke, causing hundreds of villages to suffer from floods and reduced harvests, the villages west of the Fu River that were not flooded all reported bumper harvests. It is estimated that at least 43.7222 million jin of grain can be harvested. The Handan, Yongnian, and Chengci counties in this district are expected to harvest 48.95 million jin of cotton (the other seven counties are not cotton-producing areas). In the Fourth District, twelve counties planted a total of 21,290,000 mu of autumn crops. Nangong and Weixian had the best yields, with each mu yielding 100 to 200 jin. The yields in the other ten counties also exceeded previous years. Based on general yields, the entire district is expected to harvest 212.976 million jin of grain. This district is a nationally famous cotton-producing area, and this year, a total of 695,000 mu were planted with cotton. The best yields are over 150 jin, and generally, 80 to 100 jin can be harvested. Based on a minimum estimate, 55.65 million jin of cotton can be harvested. In the Fifth District, six counties planted a total of 4,070,000 mu of autumn crops. Due to late rains, yields were greatly reduced. Based on a minimum yield, 20.353 million jin of grain can be harvested. Fudong and Jixian can harvest 5.31 million jin of cotton. According to the above statistics, the entire Southern Hebei area planted a total of 38,790,000 mu of autumn crops and can harvest a total of 350.2545 million jin of grain; a total of 2.8 million mu of cotton were planted, and 213.5 million jin of cotton can be harvested. Currently, the military and civilians throughout the area are making every effort to rush the final harvesting, determined to complete the autumn harvest task ahead of schedule, enthusiastically pay public grain, and ensure the supply of food to the front lines.
