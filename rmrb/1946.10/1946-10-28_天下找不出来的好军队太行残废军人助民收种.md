　　The Best Army in the World That Can't Be Found: Disabled Veterans of the Taihang Mountains Help the People Harvest and Plant
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] All the students of the First Honorary Soldiers School of the Taihang Children's Soldiers, helped the local people with the autumn harvest and planting with their disabled bodies, which won the support of the masses. At the beginning of the autumn cultivation and harvesting in Shili Dian (the village where the Rongxiao school is located) in Zuoquan, comrades such as Gao Xiaozhu took the initiative to help the masses plant wheat, and comrade Hao Zhanhai, who had no fingers, also helped carry potatoes. On the 29th of last month, the staff and disabled students of the school all went out to help the masses harvest. The disabled comrades participated with great enthusiasm, doing what they could at each level. Comrades such as Lü Juku, whose legs were broken, cut in the field with crutches, armless comrades carried with their shoulders, and one-armed comrades picked up yams. They consciously abide by their self-defined discipline, do not accept any preferential treatment or remuneration from the masses, cut quickly, do well, do not damage farm tools, and give priority to helping military families and the poor. They also held competitions, and their emotions were extremely high. Some comrades had blisters on their hands, but they did not slack off. The masses said: "The disabled of the Eighth Route Army still help the people harvest. Where else in the world is there such a good army!"

　　天下找不出来的好军队太行残废军人助民收种
    【本报长治讯】太行子弟兵第一荣誉军人学校全体学员，以废疾之躯帮驻地群众秋收秋种，深得群众拥护。左权十里店（荣校驻村）秋耕秋收一开始，学员高小柱等数同志即自动帮群众种麦，郝占海同志没有手指也帮助担山药蛋。上月二十九日，该校工作人员与残废学员全体出动帮助群众收割时，残废同志均以高度热情参加，做到了各层所能。吕巨库等同志腿坏了，靠着拐子在地里割，缺臂的同志用膀子去担，一只手的同志拣山药。他们自觉地遵守着他们自定的纪律，不接受群众任何优待与报酬，割的要快，做的要好，不毁坏农具，尽先帮助军属和赤贫，他们并且曾进行竞赛，情绪极高。有的同志手上打了水泡，也不松懈。群众说：“八路军残废了还要帮老百姓收割，世界上那儿再有这样的好军队！”
