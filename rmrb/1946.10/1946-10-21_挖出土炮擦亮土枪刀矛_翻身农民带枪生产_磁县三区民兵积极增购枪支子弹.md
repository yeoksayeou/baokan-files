　　Dig Out Native Cannons, Polish Native Guns, Swords and Spears
    Liberated Peasants Produce with Guns
    Militia in the Third District of Cixian Actively Increase Purchase of Guns and Ammunition

    [Report from Cixian by Our Newspaper] After the Baijiazhuang Massacre, the liberated peasants in the villages along the border of the Third District of this county, including Wuji, Chaoguan, Nanying, Jiangwucheng, Gaoyongdian, and Kongjiazhuang, with extreme grief and indignation, under the slogans of "Defend the Victory of the Struggle for Liberation," "Strike at the Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops and armed secret agents," and "Avenge the Brothers Killed in Baijiazhuang," launched a widespread armed self-defense struggle. In the seven or eight villages near Linzhang, such as Nanbaidao, Beibaidao, Dongcheng, Xicheng, and Santingle, the militia are actively increasing their purchase of guns and ammunition, and the self-defense forces have dug out and polished native guns, native cannons, swords, spears, and other old-fashioned weapons. The masses in Nanbaidao even brought out the hand grenades abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops during the Pinghan Campaign. The joint defense militia and the plainclothes teams of the district cadres are actively operating everywhere, changing the passive approach of pure defense in the past. Each village sets up landmines and stone mines every night, and the dense branches and leaves in the forests outside the villages are trimmed, and large areas of sorghum and corn are cut down, making it much more difficult for armed secret agents to operate. During the autumn harvest, the peasants universally help each other, and even women, children, and lazy people who never engaged in production are organized. Men drive carts to transport, while women and children cut and beat, starting early and working late, and the harvest is very fast. In addition to having people specifically on guard duty every day, the militiamen produce with guns, carrying forward the fighting spirit of "holding a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other" during the Anti-Japanese War. In the past, the masses in Wangjiazhuang did not dare to go out at night, and the militia were also somewhat timid, so watering and planting wheat could not be carried out quickly. Recently, the Farmers' Association organized a watering team of more than 60 people, and the self-defense force helped the militia to jointly provide cover, launching continuous surprise attacks for four nights, and all the land in the village (including the land of the widowed, orphaned, and dependents of martyrs) has been watered. In the half month from the 12th to the 26th of last month, the joint defense militia bravely repelled five attacks by small groups of Chiang's troops on villages such as Wuji, recovered eight stolen livestock and 70 pieces of clothing, and captured a Chiang's secret agent alive. The militiamen of Chaoguan, Dongxiaowu, Xixiaowu, and Xiaqitan fought most heroically. The county headquarters has issued an order to commend them, and has distributed 70 hand grenades as rewards. The militia and district cadres in the district are in high spirits and are responding to the county's call to launch a competition to capture and kill secret agents, and will strengthen ties with the militia in Ludong to cooperate in combat.

　　挖出土炮擦亮土枪刀矛
    翻身农民带枪生产
    磁县三区民兵积极增购枪支子弹
    【本报磁县讯】白家庄惨案后，本县三区边沿村庄武吉、朝冠、南营、讲武城、高永店、孔家庄一带翻身农民怀着极度悲愤，在“保卫翻身斗争胜利果实”，“打击蒋伪军与特务武装”，“为白家庄被其兄弟报仇”的口号下，展开普遍的武装自卫斗争。接近临璋的南、北白道、东西城、三亭乐等七、八村，民兵在积极增购枪枝子弹，自卫队挖出并擦亮了土枪、土炮与刀矛等旧式武器。南白道群众把平汉战役时所拾蒋伪军丢弃的手榴弹都拿出来使用。联防民兵与区干队便衣队等到处积极活动，改变了过去单纯防卫的被动作法。各村每晚埋设地雷石雷，并把村外树林里的浓密枝叶削去，把大片的高粱玉茭割倒，使武装特务的活动大增困难。秋收中，农民普遍互助，连妇女小孩和从来不事生产的懒汉都组织起来。男子赶车载运，妇女小孩割打，起早搭黑，收的非常迅速。民兵们除每天专门有人担任警戒外，其余都是带枪生产，发挥了抗日期间“一手拿枪，一手拿镰”的战斗作风，王家庄群众以前夜间不敢出门，民兵也有些胆怯，以至浇水种麦不能很快进行。最近农会组织了六十多人的浇地大队，又以自卫队帮助民兵，共同掩护，连续突击四夜，全村地（孤寡抗属地在内）都已浇完。上月十二日至二十六日的半月中，联防民兵英勇击退小股蒋军对武吉等村的五次袭击，夺回被抢牲口八头，衣服七十件，活捉蒋特一名。朝官、东、西小屋、下七坦等村民兵作战最英勇，县指挥部已传令嘉奖，并分奖手榴弹七十枚，现该区民兵区干队情绪极高，正响应县的号召，开展捕杀特务的竞赛，并将与路东民兵加强联系，配合作战。（柴荣先）
