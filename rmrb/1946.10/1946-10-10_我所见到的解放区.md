What I Saw in the Liberated Area
　　Niu Zilong

"Oranges grown in Huainan are oranges, but oranges grown in Huaibei are trifoliate oranges." I never quite believed Yanzi's words. It was only after my uprising in Shanbiao on October 12th last year, in opposition to the civil war, and my arrival in the Liberated Area, that I gradually understood.

The process of understanding was like this: I heard that Soviet cotton came in five colors, and that two vegetables could be combined into one long one (connecting the upper part of a Chinese cabbage with the lower part of a radish), and of course, I was initially doubtful. Later, our propaganda and education cadre, Comrade Wen Shuben, told me that he had seen three colors of cotton in Yan'an – black, red, and yellow. He also said that Soviet grains even grew on trees, which I didn't believe even more. My reason was, "Hearing is false, seeing is believing."

In the villages we passed through, I saw notices from the special commissioner's office and county government about how to plant cotton this year, how to gin it, and how to fertilize it... I thought this was truly strange.

After arriving at my residence, I saw in the newspapers that every day there were articles about planting, weeding, and selecting seeds, and the language was all local dialects, which I couldn't understand. At the time, I was quite frustrated. It took me several days of effort to inquire and study before I understood that this was the popularization of writing, and that it had broken free from the shackles of thousands of years of stereotyped dogma.

"The people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is strong, the state is secure." "Food is the paramount necessity of the people," and if the people have food and drink, then all problems are solved. China is a country based on agriculture, and since ancient times, wise rulers and virtuous ministers have all regarded "the people as the most important, and the ruler as the least," and "using the people at the right time" to respect the will of the people and not hindering agriculture as the main purpose of governance. The Kuomintang says that China is not suitable for communism, but only the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with China's national conditions and customs, has universally implemented Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of "land to the tiller" in the Liberated Areas.

In the Taihang Mountains, the land is barren and the people are poor, and they have always mainly eaten bran. During the disasters of 1943 and 1944, not only did no one starve to death in the Taihang Mountains, but there was not even a single beggar. Now, half of the people no longer eat bran. Thinking of the fertile fields and rich soil in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where hundreds of people starve to death every day, this reflects the abandonment of fields and the desolation of the land in Chiang Kai-shek's area, which is mainly a man-made disaster.

Zhao Baizhi's family in Xizhang Village, Linqi District, has two people and five mu of land. They harvested 280 jin of millet and 150 jin of wheat, and paid 30 jin of millet and 25 jin of wheat as public grain, accounting for slightly more than 10 percent. I asked him, "Was Pang Bingxun good at this time?" He said, "Absolutely not, he was constantly demanding things every day." I asked, "Are you happy when the Kuomintang army comes?" He said, "When they come, we have no time, we must fight them (the Kuomintang)." I asked, "How do you fight?" He said, "We have militia and self-defense forces. During the day, the children's corps delivers messages, and at night, the self-defense forces deliver messages. The village government is the command post. The self-defense forces escort the old and young up the mountains, and the militia goes to fight, buries landmines, and hides furniture and grain. They leave behind two water buckets and carrying poles used by the enemy, tie bombs to them, and they explode when picked up. We don't need the army, we have driven the enemy away several times."

The grain is ripe in the fields, placed in the threshing ground; the cotton is stored in the fields; the fruit hangs on the trees, unguarded, and no one steals. A soldier, Dan Jinzhong, lost a teacup, and two days later a villager brought it back. A medic, Gu Jinchang, said, "We don't have real white cotton there." I asked him why. He said, "If you don't watch it, even the cotton bolls will run away." In the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou, military and police are everywhere, and thefts and burglaries are heard of every day. Therefore, in public places, it is written "Beware of Pickpockets," which is not surprising in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

Government agencies all follow the "three-thirds system"; the Communist Party occupies one-third, and the rest are non-party or people from various parties. These personnel are produced through bean-casting elections by men and women, young and old, in the areas under their jurisdiction. The bribery, appointment, and designation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas... I don't know how it's still called the Kuomintang? The Republic of China?

The heads of government agencies come and go quickly. There are no handovers lasting three or four years, nor are there "seven aunts and eight grandmothers" relationships, let alone "backdoor deals" or "deals walking through the backdoor." These terms I brought from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Without explanation, people in the Liberated Areas would not understand them.

In the Liberated Area, it is really impossible to tell who is an official and who is a civilian. I have been in the Liberated Area for almost a year, and not a single person has asked me to intercede on their behalf. When I was in Chiang's controlled area, it was almost every day. It seems that the Liberated Area does not emphasize human relations, but in reality, the closeness between people is indescribable. For any work-related matter, whether you know someone or not, as long as you have a letter of introduction, not to mention anything else, even very, very small things are taken care of thoroughly. It can be said that it is meticulous. Whatever you have to say, say it. Never lie.

In the army of the Liberated Area, regardless of rank, the treatment is equal. Cadres care for soldiers, and soldiers cherish cadres. There is absolutely no beating or scolding system. Problems are discussed democratically, and orders are executed with absolute obedience. If there are any objections, they are explained clearly and that's the end of it. Therefore, the relationship between officers and soldiers is stronger than iron and steel. As for the relationship between the army and the people, every village has a reception station. As long as you have a formal travel permit, rice coupon, and vegetable money, you can eat and stay there without any difficulty. Otherwise, no one is allowed, and the children's corps will ask the militia to tie you up and send you to the village, district, or county. This is completely different from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where the people run away as soon as they hear about the army. It's like heaven and earth.

I remember we were holding a meeting at Ma Han's house, and an old lady named Tian, seventy-three years old, widowed and without support, carried a basket of radishes. I asked her what she was carrying radishes for. She said, "To support the army." I asked, "Support the army?" She said, "Support the army that works for the people." I asked her who told you to support them. She said, "I support them myself." Later, when the troops left the village, the villagers initially refused to let them go. After explaining, they busied themselves preparing livestock and finding carrying poles to help the army transport things. When the troops later moved back to the village, the villagers ran out to meet the soldiers and carry their things.

Later, I chatted with the villagers and asked them why they took care of the army like this. An old lady said, "The manure I accumulated for three years, with no one and no livestock, and the mountain land so far away, if it weren't for our army, that pile of manure would never have made it to the fields."

The Kuomintang reactionaries spread rumors that the Communists communized property and wives, and buried prisoners alive. This is "judging the heart of a gentleman with the mind of a petty person." Who is really communizing other people's property, wives, and killing and burying prisoners? I'm afraid it is the Kuomintang reactionaries themselves. Facts speak louder than words, especially for the Kuomintang reactionaries, it's not even worth arguing about.

The entire life in the Liberated Area is one of sufficient food and clothing, peaceful and happy life, doors not closed at night, and no one picking up lost items. It is an organized and orderly peaceful society, a bright world. The people under the rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, when they arrive in the Liberated Area, will also sing the praises of this organized and orderly peaceful society, this bright world.

The reason why "oranges grown in Huainan are oranges, but oranges grown in Huaibei are trifoliate oranges" is something I truly understand now.

　　我所见到的解放区
    牛子龙
    “橘生淮南则为橘，橘生淮北则为枳。”晏子这句话我总有些不相信。自去年十月十二日在山彪起义，反对内战到解放区后，才慢慢地明白了。
    明白的过程是这样：苏联棉花有五色，两种蔬菜能合成一种长（将白菜的上部和萝卜的下部联成一种），初听起来，当然疑惑，后来有我们宣教干事温树本同志讲：他在延安就见过三种颜色——黑、红、黄——的棉花。又说苏联的五谷亦有在树上长，更叫我不信，我的理由是“耳听是虚，眼见是实”。
    在过路的村上，见专署县府的布告上，有今年如何种棉花、如何打卡、如何施肥…………我觉得这真是怪事。
    到了住地，看报纸上，天天登载有种地、锄苗、选种等方法，文字都是土语方言，我亦看不懂，当时可蹩扭，用了几天功夫去询问、研究，才明白了，原来这就是文字大众化，它已经摆脱了几千年八股教条的束缚。
    “民为邦本，本固邦宁”。“民以食为天”，老百姓有吃有喝，什么问题也就解决了。中国是以农立国，自古圣君贤相都是以“民为贵，君为轻”，“使民以时”以尊重老百姓意图，不妨碍农为施政主旨。国民党说中国不适合共产主义，可是也只有中国共产党，遵照中国的国情民俗，在解放区普遍地实行了孙中山先生主张的“耕者有其田”了。
    太行山上，地瘠民贫，向来以糠为主食。四三、四四两年的灾荒，太行山上不惟没饿死一个人，就连一个乞丐也没有。现在已经有一半人不吃糠了。想想国民党统治区的沃田肥土，每天饿死几百人，这反映了蒋介石管区田园荒芜，赤地千里，主要是人为的灾祸。
    临淇区西张村赵白至家，两口人，五亩地，收了二百八十斤小米，收麦子一百五十斤，出公粮小米三十斤，麦子二十五斤，约计百分之十强。我问他：庞炳勋在此时好不好？他说：可不行，一天不知道要几回东西。我问：国民党军队来了你高兴不？他说：他们一来就没时光了，非跟他们（国民党）干不可。我又问：你怎么干？他说：我们有民兵、自卫队，白天儿童团送信，夜晚自卫队信送，村公所是指挥部，自卫队护送老小上山，民兵去打，地雷埋上，家具粮食藏起，丢下两样敌人用的水桶勾担，绑上炸弹，一拿即响，我们不要军队，就把敌人打跑了几次。
    粮食熟在地里，放到场里，棉花在地井放，树果在挂着，没人看守，没有人偷。战士单进忠丢了个茶碗，两天后老乡给送来。卫生员谷金昌说：咱那里就没有真白的花。问他为什么？他说：一会看守不好，连花桃就偷跑了。国民党统治区的京、津、沪、汉，军警林立，失窃被盗的事，日有所闻。所以凡是公共场所都写着“小心扒手”，在国民党统治区说起来，这并没有什么奇怪。
    政府机关都是三三制；共产党占三分之一，其余为无党派或各党派人士。这些人员的产生，又是从所辖地的男女老小，丢豆选举出来。国民党统治区的贿选、指派、圈定…………不知怎样还叫国民党？中华民国？
    政府机关的负责人去留都很快，没有算交代至三、四年之久的，也没有“七大妗子八大姨”的关系，更没有“走内线”、“内线走”的事情。这些名词是我由国民党统治区带来的，不经解释，解放区的人是不会懂的。
    在解放区实在看不出谁是官谁是民。我在解放区将及一年，连一个请我说情的也没有。我在蒋管区时，几乎无日无之，看起来好像解放区不讲人情世故，实在呢，彼此间的亲密，无法形容。凡有工作关系，不论认识不认识，只要有封介绍信，不要说别的，就是很小很小的事情，都照顾的周周到到，真可说无微不至，有啥说啥，向来不打过门（说谎话）。
    解放区的军队，不论阶级，待遇相等，干部关心战士，战士爱护干部，绝对没有打骂制度。商讨问题，完全民主，执行命令，绝对服从，稍有意见解释清楚就算完事，所以官兵关系比铁打钢铸还坚固。至于军民关系，每村都设有招待所，只要有正式路条、米票、菜金，到那里有吃有住，没有丝毫困难。否则的话，什么人也不行，儿童团会叫民兵将你捆起送村、区、县的。这与国民党统治区的老百姓一说过军队就跑个净光，真是天上地下。
    记得我们在马汉家开会，有个姓田的七十三岁孤寡无依的老太太，扛了一篮萝卜，我问她扛萝卜干什么？她说：拥护军队。我问拥护军队？她说：拥护给老百姓办事的军队。我问她谁叫你拥护的。她说：我自己拥护的。后来部队离开村子时，老乡们先是不让走，经解释后，就又忙着备牲口、找杠子，帮助军队运送东西。部队后来又转移到该村，老乡们闻讯后，都跑出来接战士背的东西。
    后来我与老乡们闲拉，问他们为什么这样照拂军队。有位老太太讲：我三年积的粪，一没人，二没牲口，山地又远，不是咱们的军队，那一堆粪，永不会跑到地里去。
    国民党反动派造谣说共产党共产共妻，逮住俘虏就活埋，这是以“小人之心忖君子之腹”，究竟谁在共人产、共人妻、杀埋俘虏，恐怕就是国民党反动派自己，事实胜于雄辩，尤其对于国民党反动派更不值一辩。
    解放区整个的生活是足衣足食，安居乐业，夜不闭户，道不拾遗，有组织、有秩序的升平社会，光明世界。卖国贼蒋介石统治下的人民到了解放区，一样会歌诵这有组织有秩序的升平社会、光明世界。
    “橘生淮南则为橘，橘生淮北则为枳”的道理，我如今才确确实实的明白了。
