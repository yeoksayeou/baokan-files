　　"How much we miss home!"
    A reporter from the United Evening News recently visited the American military club in Shanghai. It is said that this is a decadent place, with free cigarettes and alcohol, and crazy, nauseating dancing, etc., to numb the homesickness of American soldiers. The reporter witnessed American soldiers holding a singing concert, and one American officer suggested, "Let's sing 'California, Here I Come' and we'll go home." Two American soldiers replied, "If we sing 'California, Here I Come,' we'll be back in 1947!" "Or maybe it will be 1948!" At this moment, the homesickness of the American soldiers present was stirred up. Some cried, some shouted loudly, and some muttered to themselves like they were crazy. It took five minutes before they could calm down. The American soldiers told the reporter, "You Chinese people hate American soldiers and want us to go home. But don't we want to go back sooner? I still have my girlfriend in California. We want to go back as soon as possible!"

　　“我们多么的想家啊！”
    联合晚报记者最近到上海美军俱乐部参观，据称这里是一颓靡的场所，有不花钱的烟酒，疯狂使的肉麻目跳舞等，来麻醉美兵的思乡病。彼曾目睹美兵开歌唱会时，一美军官提议“让我们再唱加利福尼亚我们就回来了”，两个美国兵回答说：“唱加利福尼亚我们一九四七年回来”，“说不一定是一九四八年呢！”此时激动了在场美兵的乡思，有的哭了，有的高声大叫，有的发神经的自言自语，五分钟之久，还不能安静下来。美兵对记者说：“你们中国人讨厌美国兵，要我们回家去，其实我们何尝不想快些回去，加利福尼亚还有我的女朋友呢，我们要回去越早越好！”
