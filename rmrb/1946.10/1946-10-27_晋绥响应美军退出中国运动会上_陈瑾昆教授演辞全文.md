At the Jin-Sui Rally in Support of the U.S. Military Withdrawal from China
Professor Chen Jinkun's Full Speech

　　I am a pure patriot, without party affiliation, advocating peace and democracy. Previously, I only held a scholarly attitude, diligently guarding my personal post, and focusing on lecturing. I never spoke about national politics. However, last year, upon seeing Chiang Kai-shek's orders forbidding the Communist anti-Japanese forces from accepting the surrender of the Japanese, instead ordering the enemy puppet troops to remain stationed in place, and even commissioning the puppet troops as vanguard forces, I knew that Chiang Kai-shek had never abandoned his consistent policy of eliminating dissidents and destroying the Communist Party and the Liberated Areas. He violated his oath and explicit orders to unite with the Communist Party against Japan, unwilling to acknowledge the Communist Party's eight years of loyal and courageous resistance, unwilling to acknowledge the people in the areas recovered and liberated by the Communist Party and who had already implemented self-governance. On the contrary, he inherited the policy of the late Qing Empress Dowager Cixi, "Rather give to friendly nations than to domestic slaves." He declared that he would be especially lenient to the Japanese warlords, who had blood feuds with our 450 million compatriots. He was lenient with Zhou Fohai, Ren Yuandao, De Wang, Li Shouxin, etc., giving them "special preferential treatment" and allowing the puppet troops to maintain their territories and expand their forces. Thus, men like Han traitor Men Zhizhong in Tianjin and Beiping could openly send people to recruit troops. Those in positions of responsibility acting with such unclear rewards and punishments, and unable to distinguish right from wrong, can be considered an unprecedented example in ancient and modern history, both at home and abroad.

　　Why did Chiang Kai-shek do this? It was nothing more than having the determination to fight another civil war. And what time was this? Every country that participated in this World War wanted to demobilize. Not only did the people demand this, but those in positions of responsibility should also do so. China, however, had resisted for eight to fourteen years. The enemy had harmed countless people, burned countless houses, lost countless properties, and plundered countless materials on two-thirds of our country's land, leading to extreme depletion of national strength and unbearable hardship for the people. Therefore, China needed not only post-war peace and demobilization but also further reconstruction. But Chiang Kai-shek did not want peace or demobilization. He used American weapons and all his forces to carry out unprecedented massacres and plunder of compatriots who had suffered for eight to fourteen years, especially the democratic troops who had contributed to the war effort and the people in the liberated areas who had implemented democracy and freedom. This behavior was opposed not only by the Chinese people (except for a very small number of stubborn and selfish elements) but also by all people in the world with a "sense of right and wrong" and compassion. The American people are famous for their love of peace and compassion and must oppose him even more. The late President Roosevelt put in great effort to mediate the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for the sake of China's united resistance against Japan. The current President Truman should naturally inherit the policies of the late president and respect American public opinion. Last year's statement on China policy was "to assist China in achieving peaceful unification, unity, cooperation, democracy, strength," to give China economic assistance, but only after China's peaceful unification. In January of this year, the foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom jointly issued a statement, in addition to unanimously agreeing to maintain the above-mentioned China policy, also agreed "not to interfere in China's internal affairs," and agreed with the Soviet Union to withdraw troops from China as soon as possible. Logically speaking, sending and stationing troops or warships in the territorial waters or shores of a non-enemy country is an infringement of its territorial sovereignty. The United States sent troops and warships to China after the Japanese surrender. According to the surrender regulations, they could only remain until the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war was completed. Now that the United States has stated that "the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese nationals has been completed," why did it also declare that "it may not withdraw when it deems necessary"? Another excuse is "at the invitation of the Chinese government," but this "government" is the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship government. The United States helping this government transport troops, supplying this government with military fire, to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, this cannot be allowed from its own promise of "not interfering in China's internal affairs," the statement of the three foreign ministers' meeting, and international law. Therefore, thirty-five cities in the United States have launched the "U.S. Military Withdraws from China" movement, with more than 400,000 people signing petitions demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. This demonstrates the justice of the American people (the following code is missing eight characters).

　　What I have said above is based on the position of a pure patriot, without any selfish thoughts. Since Chiang Kai-shek wanted to carry out a civil war, I issued a "Letter to the People of the Country" on August 20th after the Japanese surrender. In early September, I published another message for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Both were urging Chiang Kai-shek to "serve the country with loyalty." When Chiang Kai-shek and his wife visited Ping this summer and invited me to Beijing, although I did not go, I wrote to him urging him to "rectify internal affairs and improve the official system." When he said that I was "misled by malicious propaganda," I did not lose heart and wrote to him alone, asking him to abandon the civil war and dictatorship policies. In addition, I repeatedly spoke in newspapers and at invitation meetings with Mr. Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Ji, Lu Zhonglin, and others, pointing out political corruption and economic crisis. I also wrote to Marshall on the American side, advising him to strive for China's peaceful unification, and repeatedly advised American diplomat Stonebos to prevent the contradictory American policy towards China. When Stuart Leighton was first announced as the ambassador to China, I urged him to first assist China in establishing a coalition government. At the American press conference in Ping, I exchanged views with Mr. Lossing, who came to China, and when American reporters visited, I strongly stated that the contradictory American policy towards China was detrimental to the whole country. These were all pure actions for the benefit of China and the United States and for world peace. Now, because Chiang Kai-shek is blocking newspapers across the country and oppressing democrats across the country, if I were still in Beiping accepting professorships at Peking University or Chaoyang University and continuing my usual scholarly life, I would feel that it would not have much meaning. In order to further fulfill a citizen's responsibility, I came to the Liberated Areas and will continue to carry out peaceful construction with the qualifications of being non-partisan (middle missing). I arrived in the Jin-Sui Border Region and happened to encounter today's rally in response to the "U.S. Military Withdraws from China" movement. I was invited to participate, and I am very excited and voluntarily want to speak. I propose that all parts of China should rise up in response, and at the same time, we must express our attitude towards the government and the United States. What we, the people (including the people in the Liberated Areas), jointly hope for is "China's peaceful unification, unity, cooperation, strength." The specific methods have also been determined, which are the three agreement plans. These were also formulated with the assistance of Special Envoy Marshall. We only ask for their earnest and undiscounted implementation. These plans, more specifically, are to first implement the ceasefire agreement, reorganize the government, determine the number of National Assembly representatives and the date of the meeting, and determine the draft constitution. The reorganization of the Kuomintang and Communist armies and local governments will be decided and implemented by the government after its reorganization. As for the United States' economic assistance to our country, we naturally welcome it under the conditions of equality and mutual benefit. However, this should be after China's peaceful unification is fully realized. The current so-called military assistance to our country, including troop transport, supply of military fire, assistance in training troops, and other direct and indirect military-related materials, directly helps Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and dictatorship. We absolutely cannot accept it. We advocate stopping this assistance. Withdrawing U.S. troops stationed in China is just one way to stop assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. In addition, all direct and indirect assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and dictatorship policies must be stopped. This is our main and consistent requirement. We also want to declare at the same time that any treaties signed by the U.S. government and Chiang Kai-shek in violation of Chinese public opinion are fundamentally invalid. The Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize such treaties and should request the conference today to pass a resolution suggesting this proposition to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, other border areas, and the whole country.

　　晋绥响应美军退出中国运动会上
    陈瑾昆教授演辞全文
    我是无党无派的纯洁爱国者，主张和平民主。我以前只是抱定学者的态度，谨守个人岗位，专心讲学，对于国家政治从未发言。可是去年一见了蒋介石不许中共抗战军队接受日本投降，反令敌伪军就原地驻守，并加委伪军为先遣军等命令后，就知道蒋介石始终不放弃他一贯排除异己和消灭共产党摧毁解放区的内战政策。他违反了与共产党统一抗战的誓信和明令，不愿见共产党忠勇抗战八年的功劳，不愿见共产党收复和解放并已实行了自治的区域内的人民。相反的，是继承了清末西太后“宁赠友邦，勿给家奴”的政策。他声明要特别宽大与我们四万万五千万同胞有血海怨仇的敌人日本军阀。他宽大周佛海、任援道、德王、李守信等，“特别优待”外并允许伪军保守地盘，扩充兵额。所以天津、北平的汉奸门致中就能明目张胆的派人加旗招兵。身居责任地位的人如此的不明赏罚，不辨是非，可算是古今中外历史上无有之先例。
    蒋介石何以要如此做，无非有决心再打内战。而这个时候是什么时候呢？凡是参加此次世界大战的国家，无一不想复员。不但人民要求如此做，有责任地位者亦应该如此做。而中国则是抗战了八年至十四年的，敌人在我国三分之二的土地上残害了难以计数的人民，烧毁了难以计数的房屋，损失了难以计数的财产，掠夺了难以计数的物资，以致国力枯竭已极，民生凋敝不堪，所以中国不只是需要战后和平和复员，还要更进一步复兴。但蒋介石却不要和平，不要复员，拿美国武器倾全部兵力来进行史无前例的残杀和掠夺苦难八年至十四年的同胞，尤其是残杀抗战有功的民主军队和实行了民主自由的解放区人民。这种行为不但中国人民（除了极少数的顽固自私分子）反对，凡是有“是非心”和仁慈心的全世界人民，也当然反对。美国人民是以爱好和平和仁慈著名的，更必须反对他。已故罗斯福总统为了中国统一抗日，调解国共分裂费了极大苦心。现任杜鲁门总统自然应该继承故总统政策，尊重美国民意，去年声明的对华政策是“要协助中国完成为和平统一团结合作民主强盛”，是要给中国以经济援助，但须在中国和平统一以后。本年一月又经美苏英三国外长会议共同发表声明，除一致协定维护上述对华政策外，并约定“不干涉中国内政”，并且与苏联约定都要从速从中国撤兵。论理说向非敌国派遣并驻扎军队或是军舰在他国领海或领岸巡游停驻就是侵犯他国领土主权。美国向中国派遣军队军舰是在日本投降以后，按理受降规定也只能至遣送完日俘为止，现在美国既已声明“遣送日俘日侨均已完毕。”何以又声明“认为必要时还可不撤”，呢？还有一个借口是“应中国政府邀请”，但这个“政府”是国民党一党专政的政府，美国帮助这个政府运送军队，供给这个政府军火，来帮助蒋介石打内战，这从自己“不干涉中国内政”的诺言、三外长会议声明和国际公法来说，都不能容许的。所以美国国内有三十五个城市发起“美军退出中国”运动，有四十多万人签名要求撤退驻华美军。这正表现了美国人民的正义（以下电码漏掉八字）。
    我在上面所说的是本着一个纯洁爱国者的立场，无丝毫私念。自蒋介石要进行内战起，我在日本投降后八月二十日就发了一篇《告国人书》。九月初又发表了一篇对于国共两党之进言。都是力劝蒋介石“尽忠体国”，本年夏蒋介石夫妇莅平时，邀请赴京，我虽未去却致书力劝他“修明内政，改进吏法。”他以我“又为恶意宣传所误”时，我不灰心，又曾单独向他致书请放弃内战与独裁政策。此外则在报纸上及在陈诚、陈立夫、张继、鹿锺麟等先生先后来平之邀请会上，迭次发言，指出政治腐败，经济危机。对于美国方面也致书马歇尔劝其努力中国之和平统一，并曾迭次劝美国外交人员石博斯从旁阻止美国对华矛盾政策。司徒雷登初发表为驻华大使时，也力劝其首先援助中国成立联合政府。在美国在平新闻处招待会上，与来华之罗辛格氏交换意见，以及美国记者来访时，我均力言美国对华矛盾政策于全国均为不利。这都是为中美两国利害，为全世界和平所出的一种纯洁举动。现在因为蒋介石封锁全国报纸，压迫全国民主人士，我如仍在北平应北京大学或朝阳大学教授之聘，继续过平时的学者生活，已觉无多大意义。为了更进一步的尽一个国民的责任，所以来到解放区仍将继续以无党无派的资格进行和平建设（中缺）。我到了晋绥边区，恰遇今日响应“美军退出中国”运动的会，应邀参加，我很兴奋，自动要来讲话。我提议我全中国各地都要起来响应，同时要表现我们对政府、美国的态度。我们人民（解放区人民也在内）所共同希望的是“中国和平统一团结合作强盛”。具体方法也早已确定，就是三个协议方案。这也是经过马歇尔特使协助订立了的，我们只要求切实的不折扣的实行。这些方案更具体的是要先实行停战协议，改组政府，确定国大代表名额与召集日期，确定宪法草案。整编国共军队与地方政权则在改组政府后由政府决定执行。至于美国对我国经济上的援助，我们在平等互惠的条件下，自然欢迎。不过要在中国和平统一完全实现之后。目前所谓对我国军事上的援助；包括运兵、供给军火、帮助练兵与其他直接间接有关军事物资的给与，直接帮助了蒋介石的内战独裁，我们绝对不能接受。我们主张停止这种援助。撤退驻华美军，只是停止对蒋援助的一种。此外一切直接间接对蒋介石内战独裁政策的援助均要停止，这是我们主要的一致要求。我们还要同时声明，美政府违反中国民意与蒋介石签订的任何条约均根本无效。中国人民绝对不能承认这种条约，应请今日大会决议通过向中共中央与其他边区及全国一致建议这一主张。
