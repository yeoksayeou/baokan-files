　　A Certain Person in Charge of the CCP Central Committee Tells Reporters
　　Chiang's Troops' Attack on Zhangjiakou Suffers Setbacks; Another Attempt to Ceasefire for Ten Days to Transfer Troops for Another Attack
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] This reporter interviewed a certain person in charge of the CCP Central Committee today, asking about the memorandum submitted by the CCP delegation in Nanjing on the 1st, stating that if Chiang Kai-shek does not stop attacking Zhangjiakou, it will be considered a final and complete rupture. What are the attitudes of Chiang and the US towards this? According to the person in charge, the memorandum of the CCP delegation in Nanjing was delivered to Chiang and the US respectively at 11:00 am on the 1st. On the 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek sent a memorandum through Marshall, the content of which was absurd, and did not mention a word about the attack on Zhangjiakou. At this time, Chiang's troops were fiercely attacking Zhangjiakou. Our army continued the victory on the Pinghan Line on the 30th of last month, and achieved two victories on the Huailai front on the 3rd and 4th. Chiang Kai-shek's dream of "capturing Zhangjiakou before October 10th" was shattered. At 8:00 am on the 6th, US Ambassador Stuart told Zhou Enlai's secretary Wang Bingnan: He (Stuart) saw Chiang on the morning of the 6th, and Chiang agreed: (1) to stop the attack on the Zhangjiakou area for ten days; (2) During these ten days, in order to prevent conflicts, the US will send several groups, with no Chiang representatives in the groups in the Liberated Areas, no CCP representatives in the Chiang areas, and all three parties participating in the so-called "public areas"; (3) During these ten days, meetings will be held to discuss according to the content of the memorandum submitted by Chiang Kai-shek on the 2nd. This is the attitude of Chiang and the US since the 1st of this month. The reporter then asked whether the CCP agreed to the ten-day ceasefire. The person in charge said: Chiang Kai-shek began attacking Zhangjiakou on the 29th of last month, and after suffering serious setbacks, he proposed a so-called "ten-day ceasefire" because Chiang Kai-shek needed ten days to mobilize troops. The CCP believes that if Chiang Kai-shek does not want a final and complete rupture, he should completely cancel the attack on Zhangjiakou, rather than the so-called ten-day ceasefire. If he does not completely cancel the attack on Zhangjiakou, he should bear full responsibility for all the consequences of a complete rupture.

　　中共中央某负责人告记者
    蒋军进攻张垣遭受挫败又图停战十天调兵再犯
    【新华社延安七日电】记者今日往晤中共中央某负责人，询以南京中共代表团一日提出备忘录，声明如蒋介石不停止进攻张家口，即认为系最后全面破裂，蒋美两方对此态度如何？据该负责人答称：南京中共代表团备忘录于一日午前十一时分别送达蒋美两方，二日蒋介石经由马歇尔送来备忘录，内容荒谬，对于进攻张垣之事一字不提，此时蒋军对张家口正在猛烈进攻。我军即继续上月三十日平汉线的胜利，在怀来前线三四两日两度告捷，蒋介石所预定的“十月十日前攻下张家口”的迷梦遂告粉碎。六日上午八时，美大使司徒雷登面告周恩来秘书王炳南谓：彼（司徒）六日上午见蒋，蒋同意：（一）停止向张垣一带进攻十天；（二）在此十天中，为防止冲突，由美方派出若干小组，在解放区之小组无蒋方代表，在蒋区无中共方面代表，在所谓“公共地区”则由三方面参加；（三）在此十日中，依照蒋介石二日所提出备忘录内容开会商讨。这就是本月一日以后蒋美两方面的态度。记者又问中共方面对于停战十天是否同意？该负责人说：蒋介石于上月二十九日开始进攻张垣，在其招致严重挫败之后，提出所谓“十天停战”，这是因为蒋介石需要十天时间调动兵力。中共认为如果蒋介石尚不欲最后全面破裂，应即彻底取消进攻张家口，而不是所谓停战十天。如果他不彻底取消对张家口进攻，他即应对全面破裂之一切后果负全部责任。
