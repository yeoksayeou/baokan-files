　　Border Region Working Senators Support the Front Lines
    Voluntarily Stop Receiving Work Fees
    [Border Government News] Border Region Assembly Speaker Bo, Vice Speakers Xing, Chao, and Nie, recently sent a letter to the Border Government stating: "Currently, the Border Region is engaged in a patriotic national democratic self-defense war. In order to support the front lines and reduce rear area expenses, we propose that the monthly work fee of eight *jin* of millet for working senators be suspended, and the work fee of sixteen *jin* of millet for non-working senators be changed to one *shi dou*." The Border Government has already issued a notice to all levels on the 15th of this month to comply with this, and stated: "The Border Region senators' work fees were originally meager. In order to support the front lines and strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war, they voluntarily suspended the work fees for part-time senators, setting an example for the people's senators."

　　边区在职参议员支援前线
    自愿停领工作费
    【边府消息】边区参议会薄议长，邢、晁、聂副议长，日前致函边府略称：“目前边区正在进行爱国的民族的民主的自卫战争，为了支援前线减少后方开支，拟将在职参议员每月工作费小米八斤停发，非在职参议员工作费小米十六斤改为一市斗。”边府已于本月十五日通令各级遵照执行，并称：边区参议员工作费原本菲薄，为支援前线争取自卫爱国战争胜利，自愿停发兼职参议员工作费，足资人民参议员之表率。
