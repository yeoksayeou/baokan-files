　　Fushan Militia Fight Heroically
    Taiyue 19th Military Sub-district Issues Commendation
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 15th dispatch] The Fushan militia fought heroically, and the Taiyue 19th Military Sub-district issued a commendation order on the 8th, calling on the entire district to learn from them: First, learn from the Fushan militia's expertise in explosives; before the Chiang troops occupied Fushan, they deployed landmine arrays everywhere, making it difficult for the Chiang troops to move an inch and preventing them from daring to leave the city day and night. Second, learn from the Fushan militia's skill in launching guerrilla warfare behind Chiang's troops; from September 28th to October 6th, the Fushan militia, in conjunction with the local masses, launched a major sabotage campaign against the Fushan-Yicheng highway, clearing all the fortifications and bunkers built by the Chiang troops along the entire 40-li line, and forcing the Chiang troops to retreat from the three military strongholds of Liangjiahe, Macun, and Dongzhuang. Third, learn from the Fushan militia's skill in coordinating with the regular army in combat; on September 5th, more than 500 Chiang troops from Chengguan attacked Mount Tiantai, and were immediately intercepted by a platoon of the Fushan militia, who held their ground for half an hour. Later, our regular army was able to arrive and defeat them. After the Chiang troops were defeated at Mount Tiantai, the Fushan militia immediately searched for scattered Chiang soldiers nearby and captured Yang Xicheng, the squad leader of the "Love Hometown Corps." Also, in the Guanque battle, the Fushan militia intercepted a regiment of Chiang troops from Nanpanqiao at Hancun Geda, capturing a machine gun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition.
