Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th -- "At wit's end, with empty sleeves, unable to afford three meals, limbs weak, living amongst strangers, no relatives to rely on, lacking the necessities of life (referring to oil, salt, firewood, rice, sauce, vinegar, and tea), eight years of resistance, nine deaths and one survival, utterly heartbroken!" This is one of the popular rhymes circulating among the Kuomintang demobilized officers stranded in Shanghai, all of whom belong to non-Chiang Kai-shek's directly controlled departments. Even the "Eight Hundred Heroes," famous throughout the country for their defense of the Sihang Warehouse, are now mostly wandering the streets of Shanghai. Madam Xie Jinyuan, the wife of the regimental commander Xie Jinyuan, told a reporter from the Southwest Daily at the end of last month: "The families of foreign soldiers are well taken care of by their governments. After China finished fighting and won the victory, they just kicked you away." A hero surnamed Li also said: "Now, many traitors are still treated preferentially, but we, who contributed to the War of Resistance, are ignored by the government." Similar situations are widespread in Nanjing, Chongqing, Kunming, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. In Nanjing, at the entrance of Datong Palace on Zhongdong Road, a demobilized officer in tattered clothes wrote in large characters on the ground with chalk last month: "Eight years of resistance, ending up like this!" Another disabled veteran, Gong Peilin, who suffered severe injuries and lost his sight during the War of Resistance, begs on the streets during the day and sleeps on the stone benches of Xiaguan Railway Station at night. He wrote to a newspaper, saying: "I don't know what crime the War of Resistance committed to deserve starvation?!" Near the Qixinggang Railway Station in Chongqing, a disheveled demobilized soldier with a Shanghai accent was constantly singing: "Mention Chairman Chiang, and my whole body swells with anger; mention Chairman Chiang, and we suffer!..." Passers-by expressed sympathy. At the beginning of the month, an unemployed officer in Nanping Street, Kunming, was also "lodging a complaint on the ground," displaying two lieutenant colonel appointment certificates next to his "self-introduction" written in chalk on the ground to prove his identity. According to a report on September 5th, there were as many as fourteen cases of unemployed soldiers "lodging complaints on the ground" on Hankou streets, including Yangzi Street, Old Paris Street, Chezhan Road, and Jianghan 1st Road. Unemployed soldiers in Guangzhou, unable to make a living, often resort to theft. According to statistics from the Guangzhou Municipal Police Department, out of 362 thieves in July, 253 were unemployed veterans, accounting for more than 70% of all thieves.

　　蒋贼狼心亘古罕见！
    昔日壮士街头立
    今朝奸伪成龙儿
    抛头颅洒热血抗战何罪？
    【新华社延安五日电】“一筹莫展，两袖清风，三餐不饱，四肢无力，五方杂处，六亲无靠，七件无着（指油盐柴米酱醋茶），八年抗战，九死一生，十分痛心！”这是困居上海的国民党编余军官中流行的歌谣之一，他们都是非国民党嫡系部。就是全国闻名孤守四行仓库的“八百壮士”，今天绝大多数亦均流落沪市街头；谢晋元团长的夫人上月末对西南日报记者说：“人家外国的将士遗族都得到政府的优待，我们中国仗打完了，胜利了，也就把你踢开了。”一位姓李的壮士也说：“现在，很多汉奸还受优待，我们这些对抗战有功的，政府反而不闻不问。”类此情形，遍及京、渝、昆、沪、汉各地。南京中东路大衡宫口，上月有一衣衫褴褛的编余军官在地上用粉笔大写“抗战八年，落得如此下场！”另一位抗战中受了重伤而双目失明的残废军人龚培麟，白天在马路上行乞，黑夜以下关车站的石凳为宿地。他投书某报社说：“不知抗战有何罪，而遭受饿肚？！”在重庆七星岗车站附近，上月末有一蓬头垢面之编余军人，操上海口音，摇头晃脑，不断的唱：“提起委员长，全身要发胀；提起委员长，我们就遭殃！……”路人均寄予同情。在昆明南屏街月初亦有一失业军官“告地状”，除以粉笔在地上大写“自我介绍”之外，旁边还陈列上校阶级委任状两张，以明身份。汉口街头“告地状”之失业军人，据九月五日载，仅扬子街、老巴黎街、车站路、江汉一路等处就有十四起之多。广州的失业军人因无法生计，多作盗行窃。据广州市警察局统计，七月份三六二名盗匪中有失业退伍军人二五三名，占全部盗犯人数的百分之七十强。
