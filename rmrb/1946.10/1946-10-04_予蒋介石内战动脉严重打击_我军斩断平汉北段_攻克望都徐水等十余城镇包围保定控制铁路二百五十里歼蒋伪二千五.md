Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, September 30th (Delayed): The People's Liberation Army's self-defense counterattack on the Pinghan Front has achieved a major victory. Chiang Kai-shek's army began a large-scale offensive against Zhangjiakou, the capital of the Chahar and Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, at 2:00 AM on the 29th. The military and civilians of the border region were filled with indignation. The People's Liberation Army on the Pinghan Front, after Chiang's army launched the offensive at 9:00 PM on the 29th, launched a self-defense counterattack against the Pinghan Railway, the main artery connecting Beiping, Chiang Kai-shek's North China civil war command center, with the interior. After 12 hours of fierce fighting, the Pinghan Railway was completely cut off by the People's Liberation Army, which controlled 250 li of the railway. As of 10:00 AM today (the 30th), according to preliminary statistics, the cities of Wangdu and Xushui, as well as more than ten stations and market towns including Wangdu, Wangjing, Qingfengdian, Caohe, Beihe, Gucheng, Xushui, Songlindian, Shilipu, and Bazhizhuang, have been completely liberated. The Tanghe River, the Caohe River, the Beihe River, and the Xushui River railway bridges have been blown up. Most of the Chiang's and puppet strongholds and bunkers along the line have been destroyed. The railway line from Songlindian, south of Zhuoxian, to Caohe, north of Baoding (160 li), and from Fangshunqiao (south of Baoding) to north of Dingxian (90 li) is completely under control. The important towns of Baoding and Dingxing on the Pinghan Line have been surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. The transportation of Chiang's troops between Beiping, Baoding, Dingxing, and Shijiazhuang has been completely cut off. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2,500 Chiang's and puppet troops have been killed, wounded, or captured, and a large amount of ammunition has been seized. In addition, one train of Chiang's reinforcements each was destroyed south of the Xushui Bridge and near Dingxing. Detailed battle results are pending investigation. Currently, the self-defense counterattack is continuing to expand throughout the entire line. (Attached picture)
