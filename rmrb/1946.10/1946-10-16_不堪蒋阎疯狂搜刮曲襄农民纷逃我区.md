[This dispatch from Yangcheng, 14th] The national economy in the areas of southern Shanxi under the rule of Chiang and Yan has collapsed due to the heavy taxes and levies imposed on the peasants. The Yan army's requisition methods in its controlled areas include forced purchases, credit purchases, corvée labor, wheat seed, regular grain tax, surcharges, horse feed, and even so-called "enemy-left grain," meaning demanding grain owed to the Japanese. In Sha'nv Village, Xiangling, thirty peasant households were forced to pay as much as 158.4 *shi* (石) of "enemy-left grain." In the areas under Chiang's army rule, the so-called "on-the-spot supply" meant that all burdens were placed on the peasants. The annual budget for Anyi stubborn county reached 20 million yuan, with each *liang* (两) of silver burdened with an average of 36,000 yuan. In addition, the methods of plundering in the countryside included requisition, county borrowing, village borrowing, monthly payments, military uniform fees, dyeing fees, fuel fees, soldier buying fees, and consolation fees. In Shicun Village, Xiaxian, with only fifty peasant households, the burden in June alone reached 2,799,900 yuan, of which the cost of buying conscripts (six men) accounted for 1,680,000 yuan. Under this cruel plunder, the peasants were forced to sell their clothing and livestock to pay the heavy taxes; for example, in Zhaodi Village, Xiangling, more than ten head of cattle were sold in one village alone. Many peasants, unable to make a living, fled to the liberated areas. Seven households fled from Zhaoqu alone to the liberated areas, and after Chiang's army occupied Quwo, more than a thousand peasants moved to the liberated areas to settle down and produce.

　　不堪蒋阎疯狂搜刮曲襄农民纷逃我区
    【本报阳城十四日电】晋南蒋阎军统治地区的国民经济，由于农民荷负重税苛杂已告破产。阎军在其统治区的征实名目，有攫购、赊购、帮差、麦籽、正粮、附加、马料等，竟更有所谓“敌留粮”，即代日寇催索欠粮。襄陵沙女村三十户农家即索取“敌留粮”达一百五十八石四斗之多。蒋军统治区则所谓“就地取给”，一切负担均加在农民身上。安邑顽县经费全年预算达两千万元，每两正银平均负担三万六千元。此外，其在农村掠夺的名目则有征实、县借征款、村借征款、月款、军服费、染料费、燃料费、买兵费、慰劳费等，仅有五十户农民的夏县师村，在六月份一个月中，负担即达二百七十九万九千元之多，其中买壮丁费（六名）占一百六十八万元。农民在此种残酷掠夺下，被迫变卖衣物耕畜，交纳苛杂；如襄陵赵底村一个村即卖去耕牛十余头，不少农民因无法生活，纷纷逃来解放区。由赵曲一地逃来解放区者七户，蒋军侵占曲沃后已有一千余农民迁入解放区安家生产。
