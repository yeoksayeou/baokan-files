　　The Awakening of a Man
    A Battle Story from the Longhai Front
    Wu Xiang
    Du Yuqing, a soldier of the 7th Company of our unit, used to serve in the 30th Army of the Kuomintang. He laid down his weapons during the Ping-Han Campaign last year and joined the People's Army. He is from Hunan and has three brothers. His eldest brother was persecuted to death by the Kuomintang's Baochang (local security chief). His younger brother and himself were conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang. The fate of his younger brother is still unknown. He himself almost became cannon fodder for the reactionaries. Thinking of these things, Du Yuqing became fully aware, determined to be a model People's soldier. Moreover, the education he received in the People's Army over the past year made him increasingly stronger.
    During the first phase of the Longhai Campaign, in the blocking battle at Chenpan and Qianlucun, the comrades of the 7th Company used hand grenades to repel the attacking enemy several times. However, the enemy reorganized for a new offensive. Du Yuqing stood up with his gun and said, "Comrades, take cover and watch me!" He shot down six Chiang soldiers with seven consecutive shots, causing the Chiang army to retreat in panic. His comrades beside him applauded. He smiled and said, "I learned marksmanship well on the Kuomintang side. Now it's finally coming in handy!"
    During the battle of Lyuyuanzi, the 7th Company attacked the South Gate. Comrade Du Yuqing requested to join the assault team. The leadership approved and appointed him as the captain. He happily said, "I have a huge hatred for Old Chiang. I have long wanted to take revenge. Becoming the assault team leader will fulfill my wish."
    Before departing, he gathered the assault team members and made a brief and resolute mobilization speech. He said, "Comrades! It is an honor to sacrifice for the people!" After speaking, he waved his hand and led the assault team, without looking back, charging forward through the enemy's dense artillery fire. When they rushed to the South Gate, with a "boom," the huge stockade gate collapsed. The assault team completed its mission, and the main force surged into Lyuyuanzi. However, our heroic assault team leader, Comrade Du Yuqing, fell. On his heroic body, there were five or six places stained with purplish-red blood, but on his bronze face, there was a smile.
    In Lyuyuanzi village, under the banner of victory, all the commanders and fighters of the 7th Company, with greater confidence in victory, mourned this awakened People's comrade-in-arms.

　　一个人的觉醒
    陇海前线战斗故事
    吴象
    我某部七连战士杜玉清同志，原来在国民党卅军当兵，去年平汉战役放下武器，投入人民军队。他是湖南人，弟兄三人，哥哥被国民党的保长逼死了，弟弟和自己又被国民党抓去当兵，弟弟至今生死不明。自己也险些替反动派当了炮灰。想起这些，杜玉清就完全觉悟了，发奋要作个模范的人民战士，加以一年来在人民军队里所受的教育使他日益坚强。
    这次陇海战役第一阶段，在陈畔、前路村阻击战中，七连的同志们用手榴弹把扑上来的敌人打退了好几次，但是敌人又重新组织新的进攻，杜玉清端着枪站起来说：“同志们，你们隐蔽好，看我的”。一连七枪打倒了六个，蒋军狼狈的溃退了，他身边的战友都拍手叫好，他笑着说：“我在国民党那边学好了枪法，这一下才用上啦！”
    吕园子战斗时，七连攻打南门，杜玉清同志要求参加突击队，上级允许了，并派他当队长，他高兴地说：“我和老蒋的仇气可大啦，早就想报仇，这一当突击队长，可达到我的心愿了。”
    出发前，他召集齐了突击队员们，作了简短坚决的动员，他说：“同志们！为人民牺牲是光荣的！”他说完了就挥一挥手，率领着突击队员们头也不回的冒着蒋军密集的炮火，向前冲去，当他们冲到南门口后，“轰隆”一声，巨大的寨门塌倒了，突击队完成了任务，大队潮涌似的冲进了吕园子，可是我们的突冲队长英雄无比的杜玉清同志却倒下了，在他英雄的遗体上，有五六处凝着紫红的血，但在那古铜色的脸上，却浮着微笑。
    在吕园子村里，在胜利的旗帜下，七连全连的指战员以更大的胜利信心，悼念着这个觉悟的人民战友。
