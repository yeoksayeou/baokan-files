　　Unwilling to be Parasites Anymore
    Lianshui Landlords Happily Labor
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th] After the land reform in Tongxing District, Lianshui, landlords actively participated in production. Landlord Chen Qingfang's family of nine now has thirty mu of land. When the reactionaries attacked the edge of the Huaihai Liberated Area, Chen sent his second son to join the army to defend his hometown. He himself set an example, leading people to weed in the fields all day long, turning sweet potatoes, and chopping sorghum stalks. The crops were planted in an orderly manner, and he learned to operate the plow himself. Sixteen mu of wheat land received eleven loads of manure per mu. Next year's wheat harvest will be enough to support the whole family. In addition, he invested 80,000 Central China currency in a store to generate profits. Chen Qingfang proudly said to everyone he met: "I will never be a parasite again, I can support myself with my own hands." Landlord Cheng Fengzu also led his wife, daughters-in-law, and daughters to push the plow, cut grass, and deliver manure, learning to labor and produce. He tried his best to plant the crops on his thirty-nine mu of land well, not wanting to be the kind of useless person who relied on exploitation for a living. Cheng Fengzu himself can now plow four mu of land in a day. Their diligent production has won the praise of the local farmers. Village cadre Cui Ouyang used to be Cheng Fengzu's tenant. He carefully helped Cheng Fengzu try plowing three times, teaching him how to operate the plow himself. Mutual aid group leader Chen Shu also cultivated more than five mu of wheat land for Chen Qingfang's family, enabling both landlords who were new to labor to complete their autumn plowing and wheat sowing on time.

　　不愿再做寄生虫
    涟水地主愉快劳动
    【新华社华中十九日电】涟水同兴区地主在土地改革后，积极参加生产。地主陈清舫一家九口，现有地三十亩。当反动派进攻至淮海解放区边缘时，陈氏即将其次子送去参军，保卫家乡。他自己则以身作则，带领人家整日在田里拔草，翻山芋、砍棒头忙个不休。庄稼种得井井有条，并学会了挡犁亲自耕作。十六亩麦地，每亩上粪十一挑。明年麦收将足够全家生活。此外更以华中币八万元，放入商店生利。陈清舫逢人便自豪地说：“我再不做寄生虫了，能靠自己双手养活自己了。”地主程凤祖也是这样带领妻子媳妇女儿等撑犁割草送粪，学习劳动生产。尽力要把三十九亩地的庄稼种得好好的，不做以前那种依靠剥削为生的废人了。程凤祖本人已能在一天内耕地四亩，他们这种辛勤生产的行动深得当地农民的赞助。村干部崔欧扬以前是程凤祖的佃户，他曾细心帮助程凤祖试耕三次，教会他自己撑犁。互助小组长陈书也替陈清舫家代耕了五亩多麦地，使初学劳动的两家地主的秋耕种麦均能按时完成。
