    Jiyuan and Other Counties Initiate an Upsurge of Joining the Army
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 25th dispatch] Jiyuan, Qin County, Wangwu and other counties continue to set off an upsurge of joining the army. More than 400 people have already enlisted a few days ago. At the anti-civil war conference of village cadres and activists in the fourth district of Jiyuan, Gao Xianzhang, deputy director of the armed forces committee of ×× village, stood up and shouted with grief: “My father was a Communist Party member, and was killed by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in 1931. I want to avenge him! I guarantee to lead a group of people to join the army!" The meeting set off a burst of shouts of "A hero's son is a hero, join the army to avenge and go to the front!" Li Xinghua from ×× village stood up and volunteered to send his son to join the army. Chen Minghua, a member of the Women's Salvation Association, said in a solemn and firm voice: "We have just crawled out of the fire pit, and Chiang Kai-shek is going to beat us down again. In order for everyone to turn over and survive, I will definitely mobilize my man to join the army when I go home!" Then, each village automatically reported the number of people to be mobilized to join the army. The whole district registered 220 people. Only ×× village volunteered to mobilize a platoon of people to join the army, and that night nine young people from Dientou Village scrambled to enlist. In Qin County, 194 people registered. The cadres repeatedly persuaded the older and younger ones to stay at home for production, and selected 114 strong and robust ones to join the army. Zhao Xingbang, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Renjiagou, and his deputy director, Yang Sanlai, led 22 young people to join the army, setting the most exemplary example. Shi Shuangxi and Wang Aisuo said to his son: "We came from Henan to escape the famine. Now we have houses and land, all given by the Communist Party. The clothes you wear and the millet you eat are all given by the Communist Party. You should go to the front to defend this good time!" When cadres and activists in the first district of Wangwu discussed current affairs, they related it to the suffering they had experienced when the stubborn puppet district chief was in power in the past. Ding Shuxiang said: "Chiang Kai-shek is his old root, and to remove a tree, you must remove the root." Xue Rongyu also said: "The militia is iron, and the regular army is steel. The combination of iron and steel can win battles." Finally, each group had a heated discussion. Zhao Yingjie, the district public security assistant, and Wang Benshou, the village instructor, were the first to volunteer to take the lead in joining the army, followed by Wang Jingzheng, the financial and grain committee member of Tieshan Village, and Ding Huaiyu, the deputy director of the district armed forces committee, and 15 others who signed up to join the army. Eight women, including Jin Chenge, mobilized their husbands to go to the front. Li Shuchang, a nearly 60-year-old member of the Old Farmer's Association, also guaranteed that his son would go to kill the enemy.
