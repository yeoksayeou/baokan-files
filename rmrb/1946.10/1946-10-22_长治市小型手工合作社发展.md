　　【Changzhi Dispatch, 19th of this month】The cooperative movement in this city has seen great development over the past year. Currently, the number of small-scale production cooperatives has reached 990, of which 138 are handicraft production cooperatives. Their nature has largely evolved from simple capital pooling for profit to production cooperation. The Li Jihuai group, with a capital of 55,000 yuan, engages in ironware business, with five out of six shareholders participating in labor. According to the September accounting of 89 production groups, a profit of one time the capital was obtained from over 2,178,000 yuan of capital. The Ma Defu group in the fur industry, with a capital of 85,000 yuan, made a profit of 90,000 yuan in one month, exceeding one time the capital. Cheng Bao, a fur worker, and his family of three, have received dividends of 220,000 yuan from December of last year to the present, enough to buy grain and cloth for the whole family to eat and wear for three years. After mobilizing the masses this spring, with the support of the municipal government, the small-scale cooperative movement gradually unfolded in this city. By early summer, there were already 132 cooperatives, but at that time, most were joint ventures for business purposes. When foreign goods flooded the market and prices fluctuated in July, except for the 11 fur industry groups, the rest turned to speculation, resulting in heavy losses for many. The Cheng Jinfu cooperative lost 30,000 yuan with 40,000 yuan of struggle fruits as capital. Conversely, the fur industry engaged in production cooperation made a profit of ten times the capital. After the government convened a meeting of the heads of various small cooperatives in August, calling for labor-capital cooperation and developing handicraft production, the cooperative production movement began to develop again in this city.

　　长治市小型手工合作社发展
    【本报长治十九日电】本市合作事业一年来有极大发展，目前小型生产合作社已发展到九百九十个，其中手工业生产都即占一百三十八个。其性质大部已由过去的单纯集资营利发展到生产合作。李纪怀小组以资本五万五千元经营铁货，六人入股即有五人参加劳动。据八十九个生产组九月份结帐，二百零十七万八千余元资本获利一倍。皮毛业马德富组，资本八万五千元，一个月获利九万元超过一倍。皮毛工人程保只家三口人，从去年十二月到现在已分得红利二十二万元，买成粮食、布匹够全家三年吃穿。本市今春发动群众后，在市政府扶持下，小型合作运动即逐渐开展，合作社夏初已有一百三十二个，但当时多为合股经商性质，七月外货泛滥，物价波动时，除十一组皮毛业外，其余都转向投机，结果赔钱者极多。程金福社以四万元斗争果实作资本就赔了三万元。相反生产合作的皮毛业却获利十倍。八月后经政府召开各小型合作社社长会议，号召劳资合作，发展手工业生产，合作生产运动在本市始又获发展。
