　　CCP Delegation Sends Letter to Chiang
    If the Attack on Zhangjiakou Does Not Cease
    The Responsibility for the Rupture of the Two Parties Rests with Chiang Kai-shek
    Chiang Actually Refuses to Stop the Attack, and Negotiations Are at a Standstill
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The CCP delegation sent a letter to Chiang Kai-shek on September 30th, stating that if the Kuomintang army does not cease its attack on Zhangjiakou, it will force the final rupture of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the full responsibility should be borne by the Kuomintang government. At the same time, General Zhou Enlai also sent an identical memorandum to Marshall. The original letter to Chiang is recorded below:
    Messrs. Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Lizi, Xueting, Lisheng, Liangchou, Yuejun, and Lifu, please forward:
    Greetings. Since the cessation of the truce negotiations in June, the government has further disregarded all restraints, torn up the January Truce Agreement, and launched a large-scale offensive in Guannei. In these three months, government troops have occupied many cities in the liberated areas, destroyed many local elected governments, bombed the liberated areas wildly, harmed countless residents' lives and property, and put forward unreasonable five demands, forcing the CCP army and the elected local governments to withdraw from certain areas. When the CCP refused to accept these demands in accordance with the provisions of the Political Consultative Conference Program, the government intensified its military offensive in order to achieve its political goals and expand its occupation. Therefore, in addition to occupying a series of places in the liberated areas of Central Plains, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Rehe, government troops also used the CCP's siege of Datong as an excuse to launch an offensive to capture Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Yan'an. As expected, government troops soon occupied Chengde and continued to occupy important cities on the Ping-Sui Railway, such as Jining and Fengzhen. In fact, the CCP's battle for Datong was only to contain the offensive of Yan Xishan's troops in Shanxi, and it was a siege in nature. Recently, it was officially announced that the siege would be lifted, and the threat to Datong no longer exists. However, government troops continue to expand their occupation of Rehe and eastern Hebei without any excuse and openly launch a large-scale three-pronged offensive against Zhangjiakou. The fact is very clear that the government does not hesitate to force the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to the point of final rupture by attacking Zhangjiakou, one of the political and military centers of the CCP liberated areas. Enlai and others are specifically ordered to declare: If the government does not immediately stop all military operations against Zhangjiakou and its surroundings, the CCP cannot but believe that the government has publicly declared a complete rupture and will abandon the policy of political settlement in the future. Of course, the government will bear all the serious consequences caused thereby. This is to inform you.
    Respectfully, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan of the CCP Delegation. September 30, 1935.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] Nanjing News: Chiang Kai-shek has officially refused to stop the attack on Zhangjiakou, so the issue of convening a three-person committee has fallen into a deadlock, and negotiations have completely stalled.

　　中共代表团函蒋
    倘不停止进攻张垣
    两党决裂责在蒋方
    蒋竟拒绝停攻谈判陷停顿
    【新华社南京五日电】中共代表团于九月三十日致函蒋介石，声明倘国民党军队不停止对张家口之进攻，将迫使国共关系最后破裂，其全部责任应由国民党政府方面负之。同时，周恩来将军并以同样之备忘录一份致送马歇尔。兹将致蒋原函录后：
    哲生、铁城、力子、雪艇、厉生、亮畴、岳军、立夫先生转陈：
    敬启者：至六月休战谈判中断以来，政府即进一步的不顾一切约束，撕毁一月停战协定，在关内大举进攻。在此三月中，政府军队已进占解放区许多城市，摧毁许多地方的民选政权，狂炸解放区，伤害无数居民的生命财产，更提出无理的五项要求，强要中共军队及民选的地方政权退出若干地区。而当中共根据政协纲领的规定不予接受时，政府更加紧军事进攻，以期达到政治要求的目的，并扩大其占领。因此，政府军队除了攻占中原、苏北、皖北、山东、山西、河北、热河等解放区的一系列地方外，又借口中共之围困大同，声言要发动攻下承德、张垣和延安。果然，政府军队旋即攻占承德，并续占平绥路上如集宁、丰镇之重要城市。其实中共对大同的战役，仅是牵制山西阎锡山军队之进攻，属于围困性质，最近更正式宣布撤围，大同的威胁已不存在。但政府军队却毫无任何借口的继续扩大向热河和冀东的占领，并且公然发动对张家口的三路大举进攻。事实已很显然，政府不惜以进攻中共解放区的政治军事中心之一的张家口来迫使国共关系至最后破裂的境地。恩来等特受命声明：如果政府不立即停止对张家口及其周围的一切军事行动，中共不能不认为政府业已公然宣告全面破裂，并今后放弃政治解决的方针，其因此而造成的一切严重后果，当然全部责任均应由政府方面负之，特此奉告。
    中共代表团周恩来、董必武、叶剑英、吴玉章、陆定一、邓颖超、李维汉谨启。三十五年九月卅日。
    【新华社延安五日电】南京讯：蒋介石已正式拒绝停止进攻张家口，因此召开三人委员会的问题，已陷于僵局，谈判完全停顿。
