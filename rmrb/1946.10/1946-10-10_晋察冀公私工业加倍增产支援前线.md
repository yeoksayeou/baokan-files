　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th. Workers in the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area are dramatically increasing production efficiency under the slogan "Produce More for the Front Lines." Workers in the pulping and other sections of the Xuanhua Paper Company, despite drawing one-third of their manpower to expand the armed self-defense corps, have increased paper production by more than double compared to before. @ Workers in the workshop, under the leadership of the veteran worker Ma Yulan, diligently work until late at night every day, and then start the fire and begin work again at six o'clock the next morning. The iron smelting efficiency of the privately-owned Huamin Iron Foundry has also more than doubled. Mr. Wang Zhenling, the manager of the factory, said, "The prosperity and development of our private factories today is entirely due to the multi-faceted support of the democratic government. In the current situation, we should defend the liberated areas, protect this nursery for cultivating national industry, and fully support the front lines." Seventy workers in the Industry Department of the Ji-Jin Military Region have volunteered to work twelve to fifteen extra hours per week. Labor hero Meng Qiu has already created a new production increase record of 300%. All workers in the sand molding section of the First Military Sub-district's militia mine factory have abolished the Sunday holiday system, and the output of landmines has rapidly increased to more than double. After the Jizhong Daobao Newspaper Printing Factory drew a large number of workers to other urgent production departments, it not only completed its daily newspaper printing business as usual, but also rushed to print a large number of self-defense mobilization propaganda materials.

    【新华社张家口七日电】晋察冀解放区各地工人在“多多为前线增产”口号下，生产效率急剧提高。宣化纸业公司装桨等股工人，抽出三分之一人力扩大武装工作自卫队，造纸量反较前提高一倍多。＠工股工人在股长老工友马玉兰领导下，每日均孜孜工作到深夜，翌晨六点钟即又升火动工。私营华民铸铁厂熔铁效率，亦增加一倍多。该厂经理王振灵氏表示：“我等私营工厂得以有今日的繁荣发展，全赖民主政府多方扶助所致，今天情势应为保卫解放区，保卫这一块培植民族工业的苗圃，全力支援前线。”冀晋军区工业部有七十个工人自愿每周加工十二至十五个钟头。劳动英雄孟秋已创造了百分之三的增产新纪录。一分区民兵雷弹厂翻砂股工人全体取消礼拜休假制，地雷的产量已飞快增加到两倍以上。冀中导报社印刷厂抽出大批工人至其他紧急生产部门后，除照常完成了日常印报业务外，并赶印了大批自卫动员宣传品。
