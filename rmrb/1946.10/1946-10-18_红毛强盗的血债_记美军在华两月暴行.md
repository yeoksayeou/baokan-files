　　Blood Debt of the Red-Haired Robbers
    ——A Record of American Military Atrocities in China Over Two Months——
    American military atrocities in China are escalating. In addition to helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, they are also wantonly raping, looting, killing, and smuggling in the KMT-controlled areas. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to incomplete statistics, in the eleven months from September of last year to July of this year, a total of 1,500 people were injured or killed by American military atrocities. However, in the recent two months of August and September alone, this number reached 366. If we add the numbers of Americans beating and killing people, hitting people with cars, and raping women in Nanjing, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, the total reaches 1,213 people, averaging more than 20 people per day. Those who suffered losses due to extortion, forced purchases, robbery, and insults are not included. Therefore, the people of Shanghai have directly called the American military "red-haired robbers."
    In the past two months of August and September, the "feature" of American military atrocities has been even more blatant shooting and killing. According to local newspapers, in Tianjin, Beiping, and Qingdao alone, American soldiers killed seven of our compatriots and injured two others for no reason in these two months; including Cao Guiming, a student of the Affiliated High School of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping, Wang Endi, a railway worker, Ren Yizhuang, an old farmer, Qiu Fusheng, a policeman, and Fu Qin-tao of a KMT army unit in Qingdao.
    We can see how barbaric the American troops stationed in China are from the Cao Guiming incident. On September 5th, Cao was walking down the street when an American soldier passed by. Seeing that Cao was wearing a pair of American khaki pants, he kicked Cao hard without asking why. Cao was forced to step aside, but the American soldier fired four shots in a row, wounding Cao, stripping off his khaki pants, and taking them away. It has recently been reported that Cao has died of his injuries. We have to ask: Do Chinese people not even have the "freedom to wear pants"?
    An equally cruel incident occurred on September 23rd, when an eleven-year-old girl was playing by the Hai River on Qufu Road in Tianjin. She was suddenly grabbed by a group of American soldiers passing by and thrown into the river, where she drowned. At that time, a Chinese porter entered the water to try and rescue her, but the American soldiers stood by and watched on the shore, completely at ease. This kind of inhuman atrocity is even worse than that of the Japanese invaders!
    These barbaric American soldiers usually do not pay enough fare when taking a ride, do not pay enough when shopping, kick rickshaw drivers half to death, and beat peddlers until they bleed. Sometimes they even arbitrarily arrest Chinese and foreigners. For example, on August 8th, U.S. Marine Corps military police in Tianjin arrested ten to twenty Russians and Italians at once in various cafes.
    In Shanghai and Nanjing, incidents of American soldiers killing or beating our compatriots for no reason have also occurred one after another. For example: On September 22nd, rickshaw puller Zang Zhicheng pulled a Spaniard named Lai Lingna to the Huadu Dance Hall on Xikou Road. Unexpectedly, Lai did not pay the fare and strode inside. Zang then waited at the entrance of the dance hall. After a while, Lai came out with an American sailor. Zang stepped forward to ask for money, but was beaten to death by Lai and the sailor. (Shanghai United Evening News)
    The American military simply does not regard the lives of Chinese people as important. One day at dusk, a pedicab carrying two "red-haired soldiers" sped along Chengdu Road, when one of them suddenly pulled the rear awning of a rickshaw traveling alongside, causing the rickshaw to overturn. The passenger fell to the ground and was struck in the head by the rickshaw shaft, causing blood to flow profusely. And these two "red-haired soldiers" actually danced and laughed heartily. Can we tolerate such a thing?
    The number of American military jeep killings is increasing rapidly, and the newspapers in the KMT-controlled areas no longer treat it as news. Take Shanghai as an example: In the eleven months from September of last year to July of this year, American military vehicles in Shanghai injured about 600 of our compatriots. According to personnel at Guangci Hospital, in August alone, 30 Chinese people were sent to the hospital for treatment after being hit by American military jeeps, including 20 seriously injured and 5 dead. There are five or six hospitals in Shanghai with the same nature as this hospital (specializing in admitting emergency patients sent by the police station). In this way, in the two months of August and September, at least 350 people in Shanghai were killed or injured by American military jeeps, an average of more than five people per day.
    After causing an accident, the American military usually just runs away, and the Kuomintang government never asks about it. For example, on August 16th, an American military jeep speeding around a corner at the Hongqiao @ in Hongkou Li rushed into the Hesheng Tea House, killing a six-year-old child standing on the sidewalk. Seeing that it had caused an accident, the car fled. At that time, a young man saw that the American military disregarded humanity and jumped onto the car to demand that it stop, but the American military not only did not stop, but punched the young man off the speeding car. (Shanghai Wenhui Daily)
    In the two months, the crimes of American soldiers in Shanghai insulting or even raping Chinese women have also emerged endlessly. For example, on September 12th, Chen Zhaodi, a young woman from Changshu at No. 2 Fushou Lane, Dalian Road, Hongkou, was sleeping on the street because of the heat when she was awakened by two drunk American soldiers who forcibly molested her. When Chen resisted, the American soldiers kicked and stomped her with leather shoes, causing Chen to be bruised all over, knocking out four of her front teeth, and leaving her covered in blood, threatening her life. (Shanghai Wenhui Daily)
    In Nanjing—the so-called capital—the "red-haired soldiers" still run rampant. On September 1st, on Zhongshan North Road, the wife and sister-in-law of a civil servant surnamed Zhang from a certain government agency were followed and overtaken by two American soldiers driving a jeep on their way home from watching a play in the evening. Her sister-in-law managed to escape after struggling, but his wife was dragged to a grassy area and forcibly raped for as long as an hour, her clothes were torn to shreds, and her breasts were seriously injured. At that time, Zhang Shaoqing, the captain of the Yijiangmen military police, witnessed it, but did not dare to interfere. But he was considered to have a conscience and sent Zhang's wife home after the incident.
    In Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and along the Beining Railway, American soldiers openly hug women on the street, groping and kissing them at random, or throwing firecrackers, paper balls, wine bottles… at women, and then laughing wildly.
    The American military's humiliation of Chinese women fills every patriotic compatriot with incomparable indignation, but the Kuomintang authorities, who are full of "rites and righteousness" and "know shame," actually specifically selected 800 Chinese women for them and placed them in "Anle Township" in the suburbs of Chongqing for the American military to "use." The careful Kuomintang officials also divided these women into grades according to age and appearance, and assigned them to American officers and soldiers.
    American military atrocities are endless, just as Mr. Zhang Dongsun of the China Democratic League said: "This large group of hooligans, bandits, and rascals, doing evil and acting recklessly, has become a habit!" The KMT-controlled areas have in fact become American colonies, and the people living in the KMT-controlled areas are constantly being insulted and harmed. The "American military get out of China" movement that is vigorously developing everywhere today was launched on this basis.

　　红毛强盗的血债
    ——记美军在华两月暴行——
    美军在华的暴行是愈演愈烈了。除了帮助蒋介石打内战外，在蒋管区更随意的奸淫、掳掠、杀人、走私，以上海为例，根据不完全的统计，自去年九月到今年七月的十一个月中，在美军暴行下死伤的人民共一千五百人。但在最近八、九两个月中，即达三百六十六人。如加上南京重庆北平天津青岛等地美军打人杀人，用汽车撞人，和强奸妇女等数字，则共达一千二百一十三人，平均每日二十余人。被敲诈强购抢劫和侮辱而遭损失者尚不在内。因此，上海的老百姓都已直呼美军为“红毛强盗”了。
    在过去八、九两个月中，美军暴行的“特色”就是更加肆无忌惮的开枪杀人。据各地报纸透露，仅天津北平青岛三地的美军，在这两个月中就无端枪杀我同胞七人，伤二人；其中包括北平辅大附中学生曹桂明、铁路工人王恩第、老农民任义庄、警察邱福生及青岛蒋军某部的傅钦岛等。
    我们从曹桂明的事件中就可看到驻华美军是何等的野蛮。九月五日，曹在大街上走着，一美国兵路过，见曹穿着一条美军的黄卡其布裤，就不问情由，向曹猛踢一脚。曹被迫走避，该美兵竟连开四枪，将曹击伤，并把他的卡其布裤剥下拿走。近闻曹已不治而死。我们要问：难道中国人连“穿裤子的自由”都没有吗？
    同样惨酷的事件还发生在九月二十三日，有一十一岁的小女孩，在津市曲阜道海河边游玩，突被一行经该处的美军抓起，猛力掷入河中，活活淹死。当时曾有一个中国脚夫入水抢救，美兵竟在岸上袖手旁观，悠然自得。这种灭绝人性的暴行，较之日寇已有过之而无不及了！
    这些野蛮的美军，平时乘车不给足够的车资，购物不给足够的代价，踢车夫至半死，打小贩至流血。有时他们还任意逮捕中外人士，如八月八日天津美陆战队宪兵在各咖啡馆里一次捕去十至二十人之俄人及意大利人。
    在上海、南京，美军无端打死或殴伤我同胞的事件也接连不断的发生。举例来说：有人力车夫臧志诚九月二十二日拉一个西班牙人赖令纳至溪口路华都舞厅，不料赖不付车资，昂然入内，臧遂在该舞厅门首守候。移时，赖与一美国水兵出，臧趋前索钱，竟被赖与水兵饱以老拳，生生打死。（沪联合晚报）
    美军把中国人的生命根本不当一回事。七日黄昏，一辆三轮车载了两个红毛兵驰经成都路，其中的一个突将正在并行的一部人力车的后蓬猛地一拉，人力车翻倒地下，坐客也跌了出来，被车柄击中了头部，鲜血直流。而这两个红毛兵竟手舞足蹈的纵情狂笑。这样的事，我们能忍耐吗？
    正在飞速增加着的美军吉普车杀人事件，蒋管区的报纸已经不把它当成新闻了。拿上海来说吧：自去年九月到今年七月的十一个月中，美军车在沪辗伤我同胞共约六百余人。近据广慈医院人员说，八月份被美军吉普车撞伤的华人送到该院医治的就有三十人，其中重伤的二十人，死去的五人，和该院同样性质（专门收容警局送去的急症病人的）的医院在上海有五六个，这样在八九两个月中，上海人死伤在美军吉普车下的恐怕至少有三百五十人，平均每天有五人还多。
    美军肇祸后，照例是一跑了事，国民党政府从来不闻不问。例如八月十六日虹口里虹桥＠一美军吉普急驰转弯，冲入鹤升茶楼，撞死站在人行道上的一个六岁小孩；该车见已闯祸，竟开车逃走。当时有一青年见美军不顾人道，即跳上该车责其停驶，不料美军不但不停止，竟将那个青年一拳从飞快的汽车上摔下来。（沪文汇报）
    两个月中上海美军侮辱甚或强奸中国妇女的罪行，也是层出不穷。例如九月十二日虹口大连路福寿坊二号常熟少妇陈招弟，因天热露宿街头，被二酗酒美兵唤醒强行非礼。陈氏力拒，美兵即以皮鞋猛踢乱踏，陈被打得遍身鳞伤，并被踢落门牙四颗，血流满面，恐有性命之虞。（沪文汇报）
    在南京——这个所谓首都所在地，红毛兵们照样横行无忌。九月一日在中山北路，某机关公务员张某的妻妹二人晚间观剧归来，为驾吉普车的两个美兵跟踪追上，其妹经挣扎得脱，其妻被拉至一草地上强行奸污，竟达一小时之久，衣裤尽被撕破，乳胸重伤。当时曾有挹江门宪兵队长张绍卿在旁目睹，竟不敢干涉。但他还算有良心的，于事毕送张妻回家。
    在北平天津青岛及北宁路沿线的美军，平日公然在大街上拥抱行路妇女，乱摸乱吻，或则用摔炮、纸团、酒瓶……向妇女投掷，然后纵情狂笑。
    美军凌辱中国妇女，每个具有爱国心的同胞都感到无比的愤慨，但是满口“明礼义”“知廉耻”的国民党当局为了讨好他们的洋爸爸，竟然还专门为他们物色了八百个中国妇女，放在重庆近郊的“安乐乡”，让美军去“使用”。细心的国民党老爷们还把这些女人按年龄姿色分成等级，分给美军长官和士兵。
    美军暴行层出不穷，正如民盟张东荪氏所说：“这一大批流氓土匪无赖汉，为非作歹，胡作乱为，已经变成习惯了！”蒋管区事实上已变成美国的殖民地，活在蒋管区的老百姓，随时都在受到侮辱和损害。今天各地猛烈开展的“美军退出中国”运动，就是从这个基础上发动的。
