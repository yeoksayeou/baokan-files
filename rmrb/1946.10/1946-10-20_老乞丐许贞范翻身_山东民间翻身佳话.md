　　Old Beggar Xu Zhenfan Turns Over
　　——A Folk Tale of Liberation from Shandong——
　　Xu Zhenfan, a 71-year-old beggar from Fengshan District, Linzi County, used to beg for food in the Dongxin'an Town area of Xuzhou. This year, after the New Fourth Army liberated the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, Xu Zhenfan ran into a fellow villager. They talked and he learned that his hometown had changed; the poor folks of the past had all turned over. Xu Zhenfan thought, "Leaves must return to their roots." He was so old, yet still wandering in a foreign land. The rich masters and madams always said "Respect the old and cherish the poor," but when he begged for food, he could shout until he lost his voice and still only get a little handout. If he was unlucky, he'd get bitten by a dog or beaten with a stick. His fellow villagers had food to eat, and people from poor backgrounds would surely be kind. So, he decided to go home. As soon as he returned to the village, the village government and labor hero Wang Songshan immediately convened a mass meeting of the whole village to tell everyone: "We have all pulled up the roots of poverty and turned over, we can't just stand by and watch our own brothers and elders begging and suffering." Everyone said: "Poor people help poor people, let's work together to help him turn over." Soon, they collected 400 catties of millet, found him a room, and allocated two mu of land. Wang Songshan took the lead, and everyone helped him plow the land and sow seeds. This summer, they harvested more than 300 catties of good wheat. Then, they plowed the land and planted beans. After Mid-Autumn Festival, he went to the field, and the sun shone on the bean pods, making them yellow and plump. Xu Zhenfan was extremely happy. After returning home, he planned to invite a few people to pull up the beans. He looked up and saw the old, black, and tattered beggar's basket still hanging on the wall. It couldn't help but bring back so many sad memories, so he smashed it to pieces. Afterwards, Xu Zhenfan told everyone he met: "We have been poor for eight generations, I never dreamed that someone like me could turn over. The liberated areas are truly good, and the people are good too."

　　老乞丐许贞范翻身
    ——山东民间翻身佳话——
    临淄县峰山区七十一岁老乞丐许贞范，原在徐州东新安镇一带讨饭。今年新四军解放陇海东段后，某日许贞范碰到同乡，一谈起来才知道家乡已变样了，往年的穷苦爷们今儿都翻了身。许贞范心想；“叶落要归根”，这么大年纪，还在外乡流浪。有钱的老爷太太们口里虽说“敬老惜贫”，但一向他要饭，任你叫哑嗓子，好容易才施舍一点。碰不巧还得挨狗咬棒打。乡亲早有饭吃，穷人出身的总还有好心。于是决心回家。刚回到庄上，村政府和劳动英雄王松山马上召开全庄群众大会向大家说：“咱们都拔了穷根翻了身，总不能眼看着自己的兄弟爷们要饭受罪。”大家都说：“穷人帮穷人，咱们合力带他翻身。”很快便凑起四百斤小米，又给他找了一间房，置了二亩地。王松山带头，大家出力帮他耕地下种。今年夏季收上好麦子三百多斤。又翻地种下豆子，中秋后上地里走一趟，太阳照得豆荚又黄又结实。许贞范心里喜欢极了。回家后打算邀几个人拔豆子，抬头一看墙上还挂着那个又黑又破的破讨饭篮，不禁勾起了多少伤心事，于是他狠狠地把它摔了个稀烂。以后许贞范逢人便说：“咱八辈子都是穷生了根的，作梦也没想过像咱这样的人也能翻身，真是解放区办法好，人心也好。”
