　　Jiang Hu forces send reinforcements to invade the Wenxia Liberated Area again
    Our army recovers Yanzhang and other villages
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 25th dispatch] After the Southern Shanxi Local Military Corps recovered vast areas, it defeated the 80th Regiment of Hu Zongnan's army which came to reinforce the attack, and took advantage of the victory to recover many villages and towns. In order to reverse his decline in Southern Shanxi, Hu Zongnan recently transferred the 84th Regiment of the 28th Brigade (formerly师) of the 36th Division (formerly军) from Shaanxi. On the 18th, with the cooperation of the "Love Hometown Corps" in Xia County, they launched an attack on our Wenxi and Xia County Liberated Areas. On the same day, they advanced to Dayang Town (20 miles northwest of Xia County) and were repelled by our forces. On the 19th, they gathered more than 2,500 people and attacked Yanzhang, Shangxia Feng Village, Songjiazhuang, Wang Zhao and other villages in several directions. The Eighth Route Army concentrated its forces to counterattack and surrounded the Jiang army in Songjiazhuang. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Jiang army suffered heavy casualties. Abandoning 35 bodies, they fled in panic to Xia County. The Eighth Route Army pursued the victory and successively recovered Yanzhang, Shangxia Feng Village and other places, and seized one light and heavy machine gun each, 20 rifles, and some ammunition.
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 25th dispatch] The Eighth Route Army advanced to the rear of Jiang's army in Southern Shanxi. Since the 17th, with the cooperation of local militia, our army launched a self-defense counterattack against the Jiang army occupying the Jiang (County) Yi (City) area. Within two days, the Jiang army entrenched in Beiliangbi, Xiaoshi (ten miles southwest of Yicheng), Dajiao (thirty miles southwest of Yicheng), Nanfan (more than thirty miles north of Jiang County) and other villages and towns were completely driven out, and the vast areas of Yi and Jiang were once again liberated.
