　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd—After Chiang Kai-shek occupied Zhangjiakou, on the one hand, he ordered Chen Cheng to fly to Beiping to hold a military conference, "a government army offensive plan has been formulated" (Associated Press). On the other hand, he launched a peace offensive to cover up his new military operations, and successively sent Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen and others to Shanghai to invite representatives of the CCP and the third parties to return to Nanjing for talks. On the morning of the 21st, when representatives of the CCP and the third parties were invited to Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek suddenly left Nanjing and flew to Taiwan that afternoon. So far, Chiang Kai-shek's determination to continue the civil war and his lack of sincerity for peace have been fully exposed. United Press reported: Shanghai observers believe that Chiang's trip is of great significance. When the Nanjing negotiations were in a stalemate in July, Chiang went to Kuling to escape the summer heat, and at that time Chiang's army was stepping up its offensive in northern Jiangsu, Shanxi, and eastern Hebei.

　　蒋介石突然飞台湾足见决心继续内战
    【新华社延安廿二日电】蒋介石在占领张家口后，一面令陈诚飞北平召开军事会议“已制成政府军的攻势计划”（美联社），一面发动和平攻势，以掩护其新的军事行动，连续派遣吴铁城、邵力子、雷震等赴沪，邀请中共及第三方面代表返南京商谈。至二十一日上午，中共及第三方面代表应邀赴南京，蒋介石竟于当日下午突然离开南京飞赴台湾。至此，蒋介石决心继续内战和对和平毫无诚意，已暴露无遗。合众社讯：上海观察家认为蒋此行意义重大，当七月间南京谈判陷于僵局时，蒋即赴牯岭去避暑，那时蒋军即在苏北、山西及冀东各地加紧进攻。
