(Our newspaper's dispatch from Jilu-Yu, 19th) In the past two months, although Jilu-Yu has been in a tense war environment and the people have been busy with various wartime service tasks, millions of peasants in ten counties, including Juancheng, have still seized the gaps in the war to carry out land reform. In Zhang Suyinlou, Juancheng, peasants combined wartime service with land reform. A portion of the members and masses went to the front lines to participate in the war, while another portion carried out thorough liquidation movements against local bullies and landlords at home, taking back the land that had been seized from them. Enlightened landlords also voluntarily offered their land or automatically resolved land disputes with peasants. As soon as the personnel participating in the war returned to the villages, they immediately discussed and distributed the land. The joy of obtaining land made them completely forget the fatigue of participating in the war. After Qingfeng roughly resolved the land issue through twenty days of movement, it immediately turned to an enthusiastic enlistment campaign. Thirteen hundred young people have formally enlisted. In Shouzhang County, some areas specialize in enlistment, while other areas focus on land reform movements and wartime service work. Land reform committees were established in various sub-districts, combined with the offering of land, to carry out liquidation movements involving thousands upon thousands of people. A large amount of plundered land was reclaimed. The masses' emotions were extremely high, and they were so excited that they couldn't sleep at night. Boping, Chaping, Nanhua, Yunbei, Linze, and other counties are also concentrating their efforts on land reform.

　　冀鲁豫战争中贯彻土地改革
    鄄城等十县展开清算
    寿阳战勤参军与翻身三者结合进行
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】两月来，冀鲁豫各地虽处于紧张的战争环境，人民均忙于各种战勤工作，但鄄城等十县的百万农民，仍抓紧战争空隙，进行土地改革。鄄城张苏尹楼农民把战勤工作与土地改革结合进行，一部分会员群众到前线参战，另一部分会员群众在家对恶霸地主开展彻底的清算运动，把被夺去的土地重新拿回自己手里；开明地主则纷纷自动献田，或自动解决与农民土地纠纷问题。各村参战人员一回来，马上讨论并分配土地。获得土地的喜悦，使他们完全忘掉了参战中的疲劳。清丰经过二十天运动，在大体解决了土地问题后，并马上转入热烈的参军运动。一千三百名青年已正式入伍。寿张县是一部分地区专门搞参军，其他区集中进行土地改革运动和战勤工作。各小区成立了土地改革委员会结合着献田，进行成千成万人的清算运动。将大量被掠土地重新收回。群众情绪极高，兴奋的黑夜睡不着觉。博平、茬平、南华、郓北，临泽等县亦正集中力量进行土地改革中。
