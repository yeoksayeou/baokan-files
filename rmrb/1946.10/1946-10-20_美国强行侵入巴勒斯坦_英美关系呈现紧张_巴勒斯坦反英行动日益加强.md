　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th -- Comprehensive reports from various sources: Since the United States adopted a policy of forcibly intruding into Palestine, Anglo-American relations have become strained. British Prime Minister Attlee recently sent a note to Truman, accusing him of "endangering the resolution of the Holy Land issue with Truman's recent declaration on Palestine." Truman, in his reply to Attlee on the 10th, "resolutely and repeatedly reaffirmed his recommendation to adopt an immediate action plan." (Reuters dispatch)

　　The representative of the Jewish Agency, supported by the United States, made tough demands to the British Colonial Office during negotiations on the 13th, including a request to increase the legal monthly immigration quota to Palestine from 1,500 to 4,000. A Jewish Agency spokesman said: "Unless the immigration quota is increased, the anger and tension of the Jewish people will inevitably continue, making it extremely difficult to restore public order." However, it is understood that Britain is unlikely to accept this demand. The temporary Anglo-Jewish talks reopened on the 15th.

　　Anti-British actions within Palestine are still intensifying. In recent clashes, several British soldiers were injured. In the Jewish residential area of Rehovot, a British army truck was destroyed by a bomb, and bomb-makers were discovered in the suburbs near the Charr Factory. The police are conducting a very thorough search for those responsible for the explosions, and several people have been detained in the Jerusalem area.

　　美国强行侵入巴勒斯坦
    英美关系呈现紧张
    巴勒斯坦反英行动日益加强
    【新华社延安十六日电】综合各方报导：自美国采取强行侵入巴勒斯坦的政策后，英美关系呈现紧张。英首相艾德礼最近曾照会杜鲁门，指责“杜鲁门最近对巴勒斯坦宣言危害了圣地问题的解决”。杜鲁门于十日对艾德礼的复文中竟“坚决的反复重申他采用立即行动计划之建议。”（路透社电）
    美国所支持的犹太事务局代表，十三日在与英国谈判中已向英殖民部提出强硬要求，其中包括要求巴勒斯坦每月移民法定数字应自一千五百人增至四千人。犹太事务局发言人称：“移民数字一日不增，犹太人民之愤激紧张情绪势必一日继续恢复治安，实属极端困难。”但据悉英国对接受此要求之可能性甚微。英犹临时性谈判定十五日再开。
    巴勒斯坦境内的反英行动仍加强中，在最近的冲突中，曾有英兵数人受伤。在犹太人居住区雷比尔，该地英国军队的货车曾被炸毁，并发现查尔工厂近郊地区有制造炸药者。警察正在进行对于负责爆炸者的极周密的搜查，耶露撒冷区已有若干人被拘。
