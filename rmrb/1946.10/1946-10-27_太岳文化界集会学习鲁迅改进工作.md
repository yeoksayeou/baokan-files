　　Taiyue Cultural Circles Gather to Study Lu Xun and Improve Work
　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 23rd] This month's 19th was the 10th anniversary of the death of Lu Xun, the great modern Chinese writer, thinker, and revolutionary. The preparatory committee of the Taiyue Federation of Literary and Art Circles specially invited representatives from cultural, educational, and drama circles to hold a symposium that morning. Participants included Cui Douchen, Gao Yanliu, Wei Keming, Lu Da, Gan Yumei, Lou Qingzhu, and more than 20 others. Comrade Sun Dingguo, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, also took time out of his busy schedule to attend. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Jiang Heng explained the purpose of inviting everyone to the symposium, which was to learn from Mr. Lu Xun to review and improve our creative drama and other work. Then, Mr. Gao Yanliu said: "If disarming the enemy with revolutionary armed forces is an important aspect, then another important aspect is to destroy all old ideas and styles." Geng Xi, Cao Fei, Gan Yumei and others pointed out the current existing problems, one is not keeping up with the development of the movement, and the other is that unrealistic writing of large works is obstructing us, making it even harder to keep up. We should learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of writing short works. Mr. Cui Douchen said: "It should be short, popular, and powerful. In today's situation of all-out resistance, this kind of work should be promoted even more. At present, we should advocate paying attention to cultural work, respecting mass creation, and promoting typical examples." Lu Da proposed that, on the one hand, writing should be promoted (most people are now afraid to write), and on the other hand, the creation of Zhao Shuli should be studied. Finally, Deputy Commander Sun proposed: (1) We should write more and welcome criticism, and achieve rapid reflection of reality and promote struggle. (2) In order to adapt to the war situation, we should write more short works, not look down on short works, and at the same time, vigorously write about soldiers. (3) Drama must be dominated by new Yangko, and attention should be paid to transforming old dramas. (4) The creative attitude should be correct, we must strengthen self-cultivation, and humbly study Mr. Lu Xun's life, which is a process of self-transformation. Finally, he emphasized: "Today, in the situation of all-out resistance war, our cultural front should also implement all-out resistance to smash Chiang Kai-shek's attack. Finally, a telegram was unanimously passed to the American and Shanghai cultural circles, responding to the "US troops withdraw from China" movement, and launching the "US troops withdraw from China movement" in this area. The meeting adjourned at about 5 pm.

　　太岳文化界集会学习鲁迅改进工作
    【本报阳城二十三日电】本月十九日，为近代中国伟大的文学家、思想家、革命家鲁迅先生逝世十周年纪念日。太岳文联筹委会特于是日上午邀请文化教育戏剧各界代表举行座谈。参加者有崔斗辰、高延柳、魏克明、陆达、干玉梅、娄庆珠等二十余人。军区副司令员孙定国同志亦在百忙中赶来出席，开会时，首由江横同志说明邀请大家座谈的目的，是如何学习鲁迅先生来检讨和改进我们的创作戏剧等工作。接着，高延柳先生说：“如果说以革命武装解除敌人武装是重要的一方面，那么，还有重要的另一方面，就是要摧毁一切旧的思想与作风。”耿西、草飞、干玉梅等先后指出目前存在的问题，一个是赶不上运动的发展，一个是不切实际的写大作品思想阻挠着，使我们更赶不上趟。我们应学习鲁迅先生写短作品的精神。崔斗辰先生说：“要短还要通俗、有力。在今天全面抵抗的战斗情况下，更应发扬这种作品。目前我们应提倡重视文化工作，尊重群众创作，发扬典型。”陆达提出，一面应提倡写作（大部分人现在是不敢写），另一面应学习研究赵树理的创作。最后孙副司令员提出：（一）要多写还要欢迎批评，并做到迅速反映现实，推动斗争。（二）为适应战争形势，应多写短作品，不要看不起短作品，同时要大力写兵。（三）戏剧必须以新秧歌为主流，并注意改造旧剧。（四）创作态度要正确，必须加强修养，虚心研究鲁迅先生的生平，也就是自我改造的过程。最后他强调说：“今天处在全面抵抗的战争情况下，我们文化战线也应实行全面抵抗，粉碎蒋介石进攻。最后一致通过致电美国及上海文化界，响应“美军退出中国”运动，开展本区的“美军退出中国运动”。下午五时许始散会。
