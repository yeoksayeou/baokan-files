Soviet Introduction

　　Science in the Soviet Union
　　The Soviet government is making every effort to develop science, and providing scientists with various material and spiritual rewards. Pavlov, the internationally renowned great scientist of the Tsarist era, was so pitiful that he didn't even have a stovepipe in his laboratory in winter, but after the October Revolution, Lenin went to Moscow and first asked him how much funding he needed to maintain his research work. Now, Soviet scientists' monthly salaries are as high as 30,000 rubles, with villas and cars provided in addition. Scientific expenditure accounts for 1% of the total national budget (compared to 0.1% in the United States and 0.01% in the United Kingdom). Recently, Langmuir, the famous American expert on atomic bomb research, in his article "The Competition of Atomic Weapons and its Alternatives," predicted that the Soviet Union might far surpass the United States in the future regarding the production of atomic weapons, because the Soviet Union has a deep understanding and extensive plans for science that no other country can match. *Izvestia* recently published an article stating that scientists have never received such attention and respect from the state and society as in the Soviet Union. A month after the end of the war, the Soviet government held a conference of the Academy of Sciences, where 1,400 people were awarded prizes, including thirteen scientists who received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and one hundred and ninety-six who received the Order of Lenin. Stalin and Molotov personally hosted a banquet for them in the Kremlin. In the new Five-Year Plan, in addition to repairing the Academy of Sciences, they are also preparing to build another research institute, at least five to ten times larger than the current one. There are 780 universities in Soviet Russia, and the number of assistants in one economic plant research institute alone reaches more than 5,000.

　　科学在苏联
    苏联政府正以全力发展科学，对科学家给予种种物质及精神的奖励。帝俄时代国际闻名的大科学家巴夫洛夫，当时可怜得在冬季他的试验室里连火管都没有，但十月革命后，列宁到莫斯科首先就去问他需要多少经费，维持了他的研究工作。现在苏联科学家的月薪高至三万卢布，另有别墅与汽车，科学经费占国家总预算百分之一（在美国是千分之一，英国是万分之一）。最近美国著名的研究原子炸弹专家兰格穆尔在《原子武器竞争及其替代方法》一文中，曾预料苏联对制造原子武器，将来或许远在美国之上，因为苏联对于科学有深切的认识及广泛的计划，为任何国家所不及。消息报最近发表一篇论文，说明科学家从来没有像在苏联这样受到国家与社会的重视与尊敬，苏联政府在战争结束后一个月，就开了一个研究院会议，一千四百人受奖，其中十三位科学家得社会主义劳动英雄勋章，一百九十六人得列宁勋章，斯大斯莫洛托夫亲自在克里姆林宫欢宴他们。在新五年计划中，除修理科学研究院外，还准备另建一研究院，至少有现在的研究院五倍至十倍大。苏俄境内有大学七百八十所，一经济植物研究所的助理员，就多到五千余人。
