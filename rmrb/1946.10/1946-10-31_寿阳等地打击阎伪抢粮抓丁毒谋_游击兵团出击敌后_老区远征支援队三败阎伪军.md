　　[Changzhi News from this newspaper] Recently, Yang Cheng and Zhao Rui's troops from the 8th and 9th Columns of Yan's puppet army entered the Shouyang and Yuci Zhengtai railway areas. Combined with their "Revenge Squads," "Yu-Shou Work Teams," and other special agent armed forces, they launched surprise attacks on our border villages, conscripted soldiers, and seized grain. In coordination with their special agents hidden in our area, they nibbled away at our territory and launched surprise attacks on our government organs, local armed forces, and militia. In mid-October, they raided Yunyan and other villages more than a dozen times, capturing, killing, and looting, forcing "maintenance," and issuing guns to the captured conscripts, coercing them to return to their villages to rob, cutting off their retreat. In order to smash Yan's puppet regime's poisonous plot, the Shouyang local armed forces and militia joint defense teams have been unified into several guerrilla corps, extending into the Yan-controlled area on the south side of the Zhengtai Line, surrounding Yan's puppet strongholds, and continuously harassing them, attacking their small-scale activities. In addition, we have organized mass curfew and anti-espionage activities to purge hidden Yan's puppet special agents. At the same time, current affairs education is being conducted in various villages to strengthen the masses' fighting spirit, and our lenient policy is publicized to win over young conscripts to return home. Also, the Shouyang County Headquarters, considering that the autumn harvest in the border area has not yet been completed, has organized several groups of labor-military combined labor teams to go to the rear to provide support, and mobilized the masses in the border area to transfer grain and property to the rear.

　　[This newspaper Changzhi, 26th] To support the autumn harvest and the anti-grain robbery struggle against Yan's puppet regime along the Zhengtai and Tongpu lines, the militia from Xiyang, Heshun, Zuoquan, Yushe, Wuxiang, and other counties in Taihang have formed several expeditionary support teams and arrived at the front lines of Pingding, Taigu, and Yuci. These expeditionary support teams are all composed of well-trained militia with rich experience in guerrilla warfare and explosives. After the Yushe militia expeditionary support team arrived in Taigu, it was deployed in dozens of villages in the plains, launching guerrilla and explosive movements in conjunction with the local militia. On the 14th, more than 100 Yan's puppet troops invaded Li Meizhuang, attempting to seize grain, but were attacked by the team's landmines and snipers, resulting in several deaths and injuries. On the 16th, more than 100 Yan's puppet troops from Taigu City again attacked Baicheng and Xixianyang villages. The team's flying demolition squad repelled them and seized a light machine gun. They repelled Yan's puppet troops three times in the past week alone, much to the excitement of the local masses. (Sheng Biao)

　　[Another Dispatch] The border struggles along the Zhengtai Line are becoming increasingly acute, and Yan's puppet regime's seizure of grain and conscription of soldiers are becoming increasingly rampant. According to reports from Taigu, Pingding, Yuci, and other places, Yan's puppet regime is becoming increasingly insane. They use large forces to suddenly surround several of our villages. For example, on the 2nd and 4th of this month, more than 1,000 Yan's puppet troops from Yuci surrounded more than ten villages including Qiaotou, captured more than 200 people, seized 40 head of livestock, killed 30 people, and raped more than 100 women. In addition, they dispatched small teams of special agents and armed forces to carry out activities and lurk in our border areas (such as Changning Town in Yuci) to harass, arresting a large number of people as hostages and extorting conscripts and grain. For example, in Donghao and other villages in Yuci, more than 100 women, children, and old men were arrested, and it was claimed that they could be redeemed with grain and young men. In Pingding, they used rumors and armed threats by special agents to force the masses in the villages near Yan's puppet strongholds into the city, creating a "no-man's land" and implementing a "total village emptying" policy. Young and strong men were drafted into the army, and women, old men, and children were assigned places to live and were not allowed to move around freely. More than 40 villages in the county have been harmed, and more than 10,000 people have been forced to move, and more than 100 people have been brutally killed or buried alive. Recently, Yan's puppet regime has been mobilizing frequently. In addition to strengthening its defenses along the line, it will carry out larger-scale grain seizure and conscription in the liberated areas. After Jing Yi's unit of the 10th Puppet Column concentrated in Pingding, it extended on the 16th to invade Suozhi Town, east of Pingding, to establish a grain seizure stronghold. Under this increasingly acute situation of border struggle, the party, government, army, and people in our counties have taken emergency measures. The Taigu County Headquarters has issued a notice to the entire county to inspect the work of hiding grain and preparing for war, thoroughly ensuring that grain does not enter villages on the plains and firewood and grass do not enter villages in the mountains, and that they are hidden as they are fought. At the same time, guerrilla warfare is being carried out better, and the conspiracy to seize grain is being smashed through joint defense operations. In addition to actively launching self-defense guerrilla warfare, Pingding organized the masses to transfer and bury grain and property, and organized the escaped refugees to harvest in groups of three or two. And with elite guerrilla groups, they went deep into Yan's puppet rear to harass and contain the stubborn puppets. The army and people of Yuci launched a revenge movement. At the beginning of the month, our Yuci Independent Battalion, combined with the militia and masses, launched sabotage operations along the Tongpu Line from Yang'an to Xucun, and from Guocun to Nan'an, and along the Zhengtai Line from Dongzhao to Beheliu, recovering more than 600 jin of electric wire. Yan's puppet troops were extremely panicked, and were startled several times a night, greatly containing Yan's puppet regime's harassment of our border areas. Now the military and civilians have extremely high morale. Our Second Sub-district has also transferred a large number of militia from the old liberated areas to Yuci, Taigu, Shouyang, Pingding, and other places to support, extensively launching guerrilla warfare and打击打击the crazy Yan's puppet regime's looting conspiracy.
