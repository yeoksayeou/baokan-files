　　Taihang Administrative Office and Federation of Literary and Art Circles Solicit Mass Creations
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] In order to develop rural drama movements and mass entertainment activities, the Taihang Administrative Office and the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles are now making every effort to collect various mass creations. All scripts, Yangko dances, drum ballads, clapper talks, ditties, etc. that reflect the masses' emancipation, efforts to produce, participation in the patriotic self-defense war, support for the front lines, support for the army and love for the people, ideological education, etc., are all included in the collection. The Education Department of the Administrative Office has already instructed all special counties to widely collect them, and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles is also collecting them from various sources. It is reported that after these creations are received, they will be reviewed and printed immediately, either as separate publications or selected for publication in the "Literary and Art Magazine," with the aim of reaching the masses as soon as possible for them to adopt and perform.
