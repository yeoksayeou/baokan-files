　　Taihang Military Headquarters Calls for
    Thorough "Clear the Fields" Policy
    Launch Explosion Campaign
    [Report from our Changzhi correspondent, 22nd] The Taihang District Military Commission recently issued an urgent call to the armed forces of the people in Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Wenxian, Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, Qinyang counties and cities of the Fourth Military District. It called for 200,000 militiamen and self-defense team members to carry out a "clear the fields" policy in the rear of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, launch a fierce guerrilla war and explosion campaign, harass and besiege all strongholds and rear transportation lines of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, seize the Chiang Kai-shek troops' grain and ammunition, and annihilate small groups of Chiang Kai-shek troops and the treacherous special armed returnees they brought back, so that the Chiang Kai-shek troops who dared to break into the liberated areas of northern Henan would enter alive but leave dead. The Military Commission also specially allocated 500,000 yuan in explosion subsidies to the militia in the area, and a large number of landmines are now being transported to northern Henan. The Military Commission's call pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek troops have destroyed our peaceful and happy life after liberation, trampled on our homeland, and massacred and raped our parents and wives. However, the reactionaries must pay for their blood debts with blood. Let us unite as one, fight bravely, and eliminate the invaders!
