　　British Business Delegation Arrives in Beijing
    Dissatisfaction with US Monopoly of the Chinese Market
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] According to dispatches from foreign news agencies in Shanghai: The British business delegation will travel from Shanghai to Beijing on the 15th. According to observations here, the delegation is currently working to improve the situation in which British interests in China are being excluded by the United States. At a reception on the 14th to welcome the delegation, Ke Siwei, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai (former chairman of the Shanghai Public Concession Works Bureau before the war), urged the Chiang government to allow the free trading of pound sterling and the development of Sino-British trade. Ke pointed out: "Sino-British trade currently accounts for only a fraction of the total Sino-US trade. Chinese imports from Britain from January to July this year accounted for only 5.37% of China's total imports, 5.45% in July, and decreased to 3.86% in August, but US imports accounted for 53.56%, and the United States enjoys special interests in China." This is the second time Britain has expressed dissatisfaction with the US monopoly of the Chinese market. British Ambassador Stevenson stated at a press conference on the 9th of last month: "In fact, this is the case; British interests in China are unsatisfactory in many respects, and my task is to correct and improve them." On the 12th of last month, Stevenson clearly expressed his dissatisfaction at a reception held by the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce with the fact that Britons in China cannot smoothly recover their property. He said: "Of course, this kind of thing happens everywhere in the world, but we do not believe that this can be used as a proper excuse. We fought side by side with the Allied countries and did our best to help them achieve a common victory. I think reciprocity dictates that the other party should not hinder British companies from recovering their own property; this request is not excessive." He also said: "I hope this important issue will be resolved soon. All consuls in China, especially in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong—the British Embassy and the British government, all consider this issue to be of paramount importance."

　　英商务访华团抵京
    不满美国独占中国市场
    【新华社延安十五日电】据外国通讯社上海电讯：英商务访华团将于十五日由沪赴京，据此间人士观察，该团刻致力于改善目前英国在华利益遭受美国排斥之状态。上海英商商会会长开思威（战前上海公共租界工路局董事长）在十四日欢迎访华团席上，吁请蒋政府允许英镑自由买卖与发展中英贸易。开氏指出：“中英贸易现仅占中美贸易总额的零数，中国自英国入口之货物从本年一月至七月，仅占中国输入总额百分之五·三七，七月份为百分之五·四五，八月份降为三·八六，但美国入口货却达百分之五三·五六，并且美国在华享受特殊利益”英国不满美国独占中国市场的表示已是第二次了。英大使斯蒂文森曾在上月九日记者招待会上称：“事实上确如此，英国在华利益在许多方面均不令人满意，我的任务就是来改正和改进它们的。”上月十二日，斯氏又在中英商会欢迎会上明白表示，不满于在华英人不能顺利恢复他们的财产的现状，他说：当然，这一类事情在世界各处也有发生，但我们不相信即可以此作为正当的借口。我们曾和各盟国并肩作战，并竭尽一切努力帮助他们，以取得共同胜利，我以为礼尚往来，对方是不应该阻碍英国公司恢复事实，属于他们自己的财产的，这一要求并不过可。又称：“我希望这一重要问题能很快获得解决，所有在中国的各领事，并特别在上海、天津、香港——英大使馆及英国政府，均认为这一问题是绝顶重要的。”
