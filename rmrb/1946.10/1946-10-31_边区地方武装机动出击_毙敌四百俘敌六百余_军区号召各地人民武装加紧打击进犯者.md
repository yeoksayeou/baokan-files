    Military Region Calls on People's Armed Forces Everywhere to Intensify Attacks on Invaders
    [This Newspaper, 29th Dispatch] Local armed forces in the border region are actively launching attacks, dealing a powerful blow to the invading Chiang-Yan puppet troops in the border region. On September 11th, the Qixian Independent Battalion of Taihang, combined with militia and work teams, attacked the Yan puppet stronghold of Yong'anzhai north of Zihongkou, annihilating one enemy machine gun and artillery company, killing and capturing over 50 enemy officers and soldiers, and seizing 2 mortars, 1 light machine gun, and over 10 rifles. On September 23rd, a company of our local troops from the Third Sub-district of Taihang launched a surprise attack on the Jiang puppet stronghold of Getuo, west of Tagang Station on the Pinghan Railway, annihilating one enemy platoon, capturing over 30 enemy officers and soldiers, including company and platoon leaders, and seizing 2 light machine guns and 27 rifles. On September 23rd and 24th of the same month, a unit of our local armed forces from the Third Sub-district of Jinnan attacked Dougong Town (southeast of Anyang), completely annihilating one battalion of Jiang's army in the area, capturing over 300 enemy officers and soldiers below the rank of deputy regimental commander, killing and wounding 60 enemies, and seizing over 20 light machine guns and over 200 rifles. In the above three battles, our local troops inflicted significant casualties on the enemy's active forces at a slight cost, providing great support to the front-line main force operations. The headquarters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has issued a special commendation and called on all local armed guerrillas, work teams, and militia in the marginal areas of the entire region to make persistent efforts and learn to fight more of these small annihilation battles.

According to preliminary statistics, in the past half month (from the 2nd to the 19th), a total of 16 major battles were fought, recovering more than 10 large and small towns, killing and wounding more than 390 enemy officers and soldiers below the rank of detachment leader and battalion commander, capturing alive 290 enemy soldiers below the rank of company commander, and seizing 1 mortar, 4 heavy machine guns, more than 20 light machine guns, 9 grenade launchers, 3 Sten submachine guns, 6 pistols, and 273 rifles.
