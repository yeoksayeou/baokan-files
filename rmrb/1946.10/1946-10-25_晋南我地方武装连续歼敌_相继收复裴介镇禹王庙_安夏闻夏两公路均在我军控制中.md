　　[This dispatch from Yangcheng, October 23rd] In the past week, our local armed forces along the Tongpu Railway have annihilated the Chiang-Yan troops four times in succession, killing and capturing more than 300 people, and recovering two important villages and towns. After the local armed forces of the Third Sub-district of the Taiyue Military Region recovered vast areas of southern Shanxi, they continuously attacked the remaining strongholds of the Chiang troops in the Wenxi and Xiaxian areas. On the 14th, they recovered Peijie Town, an important stronghold on the An(yi)-Xia(xian) Highway, and cleared two strong bunkers, wiping out all 30 Chiang troops, including 19 captured alive and 11 killed. They seized 9 rifles, 2 pistols, 1 telephone, and other military supplies. On the evening of the 17th, another local armed force captured Yuwang Temple, 15 li northwest of Xiaxian County, wiping out an entire company of the special agent armed "Love the Homeland Corps," capturing its company commander and 36 soldiers alive, seizing 1 machine gun, 2 grenade launchers, 24 rifles, 120 hand grenades, and 500 pistol bullets. Since the recovery of Peijie Town, Yuwang Temple and other places, the Chiang troops in Xiaxian County have become isolated, and the An(yi)-Xia(xian) and Wen(xi)-Xia(xian) highways are both under our army's control. On the morning of the 18th, the remnants of the 1st Brigade of the Chiang army, a supply train of more than 100 people carrying a large number of vehicles and horses, marched south along the Tongpu Railway from Wenxi, and were ambushed by our local army corps, killing 50, capturing 18, including the company commander, and seizing 3 American-made machine guns, 18 rifles, 1 pistol, 50 mules and horses, killing and wounding more than 30 mules and horses, and seizing a large number of supplies. On the 19th, two battalions of the 3rd Regiment of the 45th Division of the Yan army in Lingshi County invaded Junzhai, 30 li east of the city, and were ambushed by our local army corps of the 1st Sub-district. After 30 minutes of fierce fighting, one battalion of the Chiang-Yan army was annihilated. The remnants of the Yan army abandoned more than 60 corpses and fled in panic. In this battle, more than 100 Yan soldiers were killed and wounded, 76 were captured alive, and 34 mules, 10 light machine guns, 3 small cannons, 4 grenade launchers, 2 submachine guns, 55 rifles, more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 30 rounds of artillery shells, and other military supplies were seized.
