　　Define the Land Reform Policy
    Victory Achieved Swiftly in the Li'erzhuang Land Clearing
    [This newspaper, Linzhang News] The disparity between rich and poor in Li'erzhuang, Third District of Linzhang, is extremely severe (the extremely poor and poor peasants account for 57% of the total households). The collaborators and local bullies collude together, and the feudal forces are extraordinarily entrenched. This village was formerly an enemy "guidance village," and the masses were so oppressed that they could not raise their heads. When the turnaround team first arrived in the village, the bullies threatened them in many ways, preventing the masses from approaching them. The village cadres were also bought off by the bullies, and they openly said to the masses: "Whoever raises an opinion will be shot!" Although the turnaround team was very busy, because they were not bold and did not let go, and did not promptly suppress the reactionary elements, the movement could not be started for a long time. After reviewing the situation, the leadership decided to boldly support the masses and dispel their concerns. They immediately arrested the collaborators, puppets, and bullies according to law, and clearly announced the implementation of land reform to realize land to the tillers. At the same time, the lackey cadres were replaced, and activists were discovered, allowing them to widely connect with victims, organize the extremely poor, poor peasants, and middle peasants, and conduct enlightenment education, brewing a turnaround everywhere. Righteousness prevailed in the village, and the masses' courage to struggle soared to unprecedented heights. The number of people complaining about their suffering increased to more than ninety, including many well-to-do middle peasants. On September 22, a mass meeting was held to denounce the collaborators and expose their crimes. The collaborators, puppets, and bully landlords were at a loss for words and had to bow their heads and admit their mistakes. The masses' struggle quickly achieved victory. (Wang Lin)

　　明确土地改革方针
    炉耳庄清算迅即获胜
    【本报临漳讯】临漳三区炉耳庄贫富悬殊非常利害（赤贫、贫农占总户口百分之五十七）。汉奸与恶霸地主勾结一起，封建势力异常强固，该村过去为敌人的“指导村”，群众被压得抬不起头。翻身队初到该村，恶霸多方威胁，不让群众与之接近，村干部被恶霸所收买，也公开对群众说：“谁提意见就枪毙谁！”翻身队工作虽很忙碌，但因不大胆不放手，未及时镇压反动分子，运动长久不能起来。领导上经过检讨，决心大胆为群众撑腰，打破群众的顾虑，当即依法将奸、伪、恶霸逮捕起来，并明确宣布实行土地改革，实现耕者有其田。同时撤换了狗腿干部，发现积极分子，让其广泛串连苦主，组织赤贫、贫农与中农，进行启发教育，到处酝酿翻身。村里正气占了上风，群众斗争勇气空前高涨，诉苦人增到九十多个，其中并包括不少富裕中农。九月二十二日召开反奸诉苦大会，群众纷纷控诉汉奸、恶霸的罪恶，奸伪恶霸地主理屈词穷，不得不低头认错，群众斗争迅速得到了胜利。（王林）
