[Report from the Frontline Reporter Group of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, 2nd] The leaders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region have recently issued a circular commending Comrade Cao Yinxiu, political instructor of the "Changchun" unit, for his courageous combat and strict adherence to mass discipline, as well as the Fourth Company, Third Detachment, First Battalion for completing seven combat missions and excelling in propaganda and mobilization work.

During the Luo Wang battle, Comrade Cao Yinxiu, political instructor of the Third Company, Second Detachment, "Changchun" unit, stepped up to lead the soldiers in a charge after the company commander was wounded. Because the road of attack was wider than that of the neighboring units, the casualties were the greatest, but he did not hesitate to propose slogans such as: "Our sacrifice is to complete the entire campaign mission!" "If there is one person, charge with one person; if there are two people, charge with two people!" "Avenge the dead!" to encourage the soldiers to continue their brave charge. In the Yanlingfu battle, when the friendly neighboring forces became disorganized and retreated, he was able to maintain control of the unit, persist in resistance, and not move a single step. On the way to Hongmiaozhai, when they encountered a pile of melons picked by the local people, the company did not take a single one.

When the Fourth Company, Third Detachment, First Battalion was operating on the Longhai Railway line, it accepted seven combat missions. Each time, it was able to conduct mobilization according to the specific circumstances. Even when the battle suffered setbacks, it could flexibly explain, calling on them to "turn hatred into strength," and promptly communicate the victory news of friendly neighboring units. When shouting at the enemy on the battlefield, they spoke in such a way that the enemy was "speechless," and they always maintained a strong morale. Such flexible, timely and appropriate wartime propaganda and mobilization work is particularly worthy of being put forward today.

　　军区首长通令表扬
    曹银秀同志勇敢作战
    第四连擅长宣传鼓动七次完成战斗任务
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二日电】晋冀鲁豫军区首长顷通令表扬勇敢作战、严守群众纪律的“长春”部指导员曹银秀同志，及完成七次战斗任务并善于作宣传鼓动工作的一分队三中队第四连。
    “长春”二分队三中队三连政治指导员曹银秀同志在罗王战斗中，连长负伤，他即率领战士冲锋，因进攻的道路较友邻部队开阔，伤亡最大，但他毫不迟疑的提出：“我们的牺牲是为了完成整个战役任务。”“有一人，冲一人；有二人，冲二人！”“给死者报仇！”等口号，鼓动战士继续勇敢的冲锋。在鄢陵府战斗中，友邻部队混乱后撤，他却能掌握部队，坚持抵抗，一步未动。在到红庙寨的途中，遇到老乡摘下的一堆瓜，该连未拿一个。
    一分队三中队四连在陇海线作战时，共接受七次战斗任务，每次都能根据具体情况进行动员，即使战斗受到挫折时，也能灵活解释，号召“把仇恨变成力量”，并及时传达友邻部队的胜利消息。在战场对敌喊话时，说得敌人“哑口无言”，始终保持了旺盛的士气。这样灵活及时恰当的战时宣传鼓动工作，今天特别值得提出。
