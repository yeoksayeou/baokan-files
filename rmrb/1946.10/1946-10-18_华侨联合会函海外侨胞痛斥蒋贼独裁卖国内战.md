　　Overseas Chinese Federation Letter to Overseas Chinese Compatriots Denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's Dictatorship, Selling Out the Country, and Waging Civil War

[Reported by this newspaper] The Yan'an Overseas Chinese Federation recently sent a letter to overseas Chinese compatriots, expressing extreme indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on the US government's aid to frantically launch a nationwide civil war. The letter accused the Kuomintang government of persecuting overseas Chinese, stating: "In the 1941 Southern Anhui Incident, hundreds of overseas Chinese brothers were brutally murdered. Lin Jiabi, an overseas Chinese from the Philippines, survived the Southern Anhui Incident. He personally witnessed Kuomintang officers smash the head of a Malaysian overseas Chinese compatriot who was already injured; another female overseas Chinese student from Java was raped to death by them. Recently, millions of overseas Chinese dependents remaining in Fujian and Guangdong are crying out for food and clothing. The Kuomintang government not only fails to provide relief but also sabotages the overseas Chinese's hometown relief work, detaining remittances and embezzling relief supplies. In short, under the rule of the Kuomintang government, which is selling out the country, waging civil war, and exercising dictatorship, the lives and property of our overseas Chinese compatriots cannot be guaranteed." The letter detailed the happy lives of overseas Chinese in Yan'an, making a clear comparison with the Kuomintang areas. For example, Ah Huang, a mechanic who returned from Singapore, said: "When I was driving on the Southwest Highway, I was arrested and detained by the Kuomintang because I did not accept their anti-communist education and refused to act as a special agent. Now, many of the mechanics who returned to the country to serve with me are stranded in Yunnan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and other places, unable to find jobs, unable to get help, unable to return home, and some have even become beggars. But in Yan'an, as a driver, my treatment is better than that of ordinary cadres. After work, someone teaches me to read, I can get free medical treatment when I am sick, and I can freely participate in entertainment parties every Sunday or holiday. This is worlds apart from the lack of security and respect for the personality of overseas Chinese workers in the Kuomintang areas. I feel that only in the liberated areas under the democratic government can we be truly cared for." However, the letter continued: "The flames of civil war are ravaging this democratic paradise, and the safety of our overseas Chinese is also seriously threatened. Wangjiaping, which was bombed by Kuomintang planes on August 2nd, is precisely where our Overseas Chinese Federation is located." The letter called on "all patriotic compatriots at home and abroad to unite and smash the rule of fascist dictatorship, so that the motherland will not be reduced to a colony of American imperialism, improve the status of overseas Chinese abroad, and realize a new China that is independent, peaceful, democratic, and happy."

　　华侨联合会函海外侨胞痛斥蒋贼独裁卖国内战
    【本报讯】延安华侨联合会于日前致函海外侨胞，对蒋介石依仗美国政府的援助，疯狂发动全国性的内战，表示极端愤慨。该函控诉国民党政府对华侨的迫害称：“一九四一年的皖南事变，华侨兄弟被惨杀者数以百计。菲律宾华侨林家碧，是皖南事变的虎口余生者，他曾亲眼看见，国民党军官把一个头部已受伤的马来亚侨胞脑壳打碎；另有一个爪哇华侨女学生，则被他们轮奸致死。最近留在闽粤的千百万侨眷，正嗷嗷待哺，国民党政府不但不予救济，反而破坏华侨的救乡工作，扣押侨汇，贪污救济物资。总之，在卖国内战独裁的国民党政府统治下，我们侨胞的生命财产是得不到保障的。”该函详述留延华侨的幸福生活时，曾与国民党区做了鲜明的对比。例如新加坡回国机工阿黄说：“我在西南公路开车时，曾被国民党抓去坐禁闭，因为我不接受他们的反共教育，拒绝充当特务。现在，和我一起回国服务的机工，有许多人流落在云南、贵州、重庆等地，求职不得，呼救无应，回家不能，有的甚至沦为乞丐。可是我在延安当司机，待遇比一般干部还好，工余有人教我读书，有病可免费治疗，每逢星期日或假日，可以自由参加娱乐晚会。这与国民党区华侨职工生活毫无保障，人格不受尊重，实有天渊之别。我感到只有在民主政府的解放区，我们才能真正被爱护。”但是，该函继称：“内战的炮火正在摧残着这民主的乐园，我们华侨的安全也受到了严重的威胁。八月二号被国民党飞机轰炸的王家坪，正是我们华侨联合会的所在地。”该函号召“海内外一切爱国同胞，团结一致，粉碎法西斯独裁的统治，使祖国不致沦为美帝国主义的殖民地，提高华侨在海外的地位，实现独立和平民主幸福的新中国。”
