Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 30th: The Special Tribunal of the War Criminals Trial Committee of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Government publicly tried nine Japanese war criminals in Zhangjiakou on the 20th: Kobayashi Toku, Abe Susumu, Tazawa Tokusaburo, Inoue Yukio, Mizutani Masao, Isa Kuranosuke, Nomura Takazo, Iwaishi Riichi, and Uekura Eizo. The presiding judge was Wang Feiran, President of the Border Region High Court. The war criminals confessed to their heinous crimes of waging a war of aggression, torturing and killing Chinese anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians, and continuing to collude with Kuomintang secret agents and bandits to infiltrate the liberated areas for sabotage even after the surrender was announced. The Special Tribunal, based on the Potsdam Conference's decision to severely punish war criminals and the public prosecution of the people in various parts of the Border Region, sentenced the war criminals to death. They were immediately escorted to the execution ground and shot, to the satisfaction of everyone. The crimes of the nine Japanese war criminals are briefly described as follows: (1) Before the July 7th Incident, Kobayashi Toku, under the guise of special correspondent for Japanese newspapers such as "Nichinichi Shimbun" and "Jiji Shinpo," had been engaged in preparing for the war of aggression against China for many years. He represented the Japanese side in the "January 28th" Songhu Truce negotiations. After the Chiang Kai-shek government signed the Tanggu and He-Ume agreements, Kobayashi Toku once served as an advisor to Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Kuomintang Hebei Province, to carry out a conspiracy to occupy the entire North China. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the war criminal served as an important member of the First and Third Sections of the Kwantung Army Headquarters of the Japanese invaders in North China. (2) Abe Susumu successively held important positions as a member of the puppet Xingmeng Committee and head of the planning section of the puppet Mengjiang General Affairs Office, and was a well-known executioner who enslaved and plundered the people of Sui and Cha. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders last autumn, he was secretly ordered by Nakajima, a Japanese secret agent of the former puppet Mengjiang General Affairs Office of the liaison office of the Kuomintang 12th War Zone, to infiltrate Zhangjiakou for special mission sabotage, as he confessed his attempt to "reunite China" (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries), establish a yellow race East Asia, and expel the white devils." (3) Isa Kuranosuke had been engaged in special agent work in Shanghai and other places before the "September 18th" Incident. After the "July 7th" Incident, he served as the secretary to Uyama Sadashi, the highest advisor of the puppet Mengjiang, and Li Shou-hsin, a major traitor, the commander of the Renji Corps (official title), the chief of the intelligence section of the puppet Mengjiang, and the advisor to the General Affairs Office and Zhangjiakou City. When the Eighth Route Army liberated the entire territory of Chahar Province, the war criminal, under the order of the Kuomintang reactionaries, colluded with the puppet army and entrenched himself in Zhuolu County to resist stubbornly. (4) Tazawa Tokusaburo successively served as the police chief and chief advisor of Wei County and Laiyuan County of the puppet Mengjiang. He used the "Three Alls Policy" to raze dozens of anti-Japanese villages in the southern part of Wei County to the ground. (5) Inoue Yukio was the head of the Japanese Gendarmerie Special Agent Team in Jining, Suiyuan, and later transferred to the Second Battalion of the Japanese 1240 Unit in Shijiazhuang to engage in intelligence organization and other work. He also seduced more than 1,000 soldiers of Chen Ziliang's department of the Chiang army in Shandong to surrender to the enemy and oppose the Communists. (6) Mizutani Masao was the director of the puppet Rehe Opium Monopoly Bureau and the captain of the Xifengkou police. (7) Nomura Takazo served as an advisor to the West Abaga Banner Public Office of the Xilingol League of the puppet Inner Mongolia. (8) Iwaishi Riichi served as an official of the Mengjiang Economic Department and an advisor to the East Sunite Banner of Inner Mongolia. (9) Uekura Eizo was a police officer of the puppet Chahar South Political Affairs Office, the leader of the Communist eradication team of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Intelligence Office, and the chief guidance officer of the puppet Zhuolu County. The above-mentioned war criminals were all secretly ordered by the Chiang-Japanese collaboration special service agencies in Peiping and Tianjin after the surrender of the Japanese invaders last autumn to infiltrate Zhangjiakou for conspiracy and assassination work.
