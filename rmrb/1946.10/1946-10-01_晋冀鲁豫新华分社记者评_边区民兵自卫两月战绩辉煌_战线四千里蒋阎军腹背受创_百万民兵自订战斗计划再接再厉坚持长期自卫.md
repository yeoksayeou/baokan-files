Jinchaji-Luyu Xinhua Branch, Handan, 28th – Since August, for fifty days, millions of militia in the Jinchaji-Luyu border region, alongside the Eighth Route Army, fought on a four thousand mile long self-defense line along the Longhai, Tongpu, Zhengtai, and Pinghan railways, inflicting significant losses on the invading Chiang and Yan troops. A reporter from the Jinchaji-Luyu Xinhua Branch commented: This force, which cannot be ignored in the fight against the civil war, has further demonstrated the enthusiasm and tenacity of the eight-year War of Resistance on the basis of implementing "land to the tiller." In mid-August, when our main forces launched the Longhai self-defense counterattack, the border region's people's armed forces cooperated with the main forces to raid the Kaifeng South Gate Airport, the internal war command center of Liu Zhi, and liberated Zhuxian Town, one of the four major towns in the country, putting the Chiang troops in a position of being attacked from both sides. On August 13, the Chiang troops again invaded our liberated areas in the central section of the Tongpu Railway. The Fen River South militia cooperated with our front-line troops in combat, launching a wide-ranging guerrilla offensive in the areas occupied by the Chiang troops, removing the Chiang military satellite strongholds of Xia County's Weiguo Town and Linfen's Xiandi Town, forcing the Chiang troops to withdraw a large number of troops to reinforce their rear. In mid-September, our southern Shanxi militia advanced against the enemy, surprisingly attacked Pinglu City, and recovered Maojin Ferry, inflicting a major restraint and threat on the invading Chiang troops to the north. The reporter pointed out a major characteristic of current militia operations: the vast majority of militia often independently undertake combat missions in secondary directions, allowing the main forces to concentrate their forces to annihilate the enemy. The Anyang militia fought twenty battles against the encroaching Chiang puppet troops in five days, killing or wounding more than two hundred Chiang puppet troops. The Jiyuan Duba Lian aquatic militia team on the north bank of the Yellow River regularly patrols the turbulent Yellow River, capsizing the boats of the invaders. In one battle, they captured the Kuomintang Jiyuan County Public Security Bureau Chief and fifteen others alive. The Linzhang militia in southern Hebei, in coordination with local armed forces, created a brilliant victory by annihilating all three hundred invading puppet troops in one fell swoop, greatly inspiring the peasant masses' emancipation movement. The militia in Yuci, Taigu, Shouyang, Pingding, Jingxing on the Zhengtai Line and Anyang and Tangyin counties on the Pinghan Line carried out sniper warfare and explosive campaigns to protect the masses' autumn harvest and autumn plowing. The militia on the East Qin Line cooperated with local armed forces to harass Yan's puppet strongholds, liberating Pantuo in August and Zihongkou in September, allowing refugees to return to their homes. The Zanhuang and Yuanshi militia wiped out the Chiang-Kai shek secret service armed "Homecoming Corps" that had infiltrated the junction of the two counties. The reporter praised the militia's combat heroes, saying: Seven militiamen in Xiliang Village, Pinglu, Taiyue, fought against Chiang's troops, which were eleven times their size, repelling three fierce attacks by the Chiang's troops and finally defeating them. The militia around Machuang, Changcun, and Xiyang in Quwo repelled the siege of more than two thousand Yan troops with sparrow warfare and sniper warfare, killing or wounding thirty-eight Yan troops. The Hongtong militia heroes created a tactic combining sniper fire and explosions, killing or wounding twenty-seven Yan puppet troops in one fell swoop. They also paid special attention to political warfare. The Tangyin militia formed many small armed propaganda teams to go deep into the areas surrounding the Chiang troops' strongholds to carry out "heart-attacking warfare," which made the morale of the war-weary soldiers within the Chiang troops even lower. The reporter pointed out: At present, the militia struggle is developing in a higher form. Countless "flying explosion teams" and "revenge groups" have been established around the entire border region. The Wangwu County Militia Joint Defense established a "Native Cannon Company." The Xiangling militia established a "People's War Defense Team," brought out the rusty native cannons, polished them brightly, and said confidently: "When the Chiang and Yan troops come, we will definitely replace these native cannons with American weapons." Indeed, they have gradually realized their plans. The Taigu militia captured machine guns and small cannons, and the Huo County militia captured a mountain gun, thirteen machine guns, nine grenade launchers, and one hundred and forty rifles. The reporter concluded by saying: Now the militia throughout the area have put forward plans to eliminate the invading troops. Hao Xiaosan, a militia hero from Shahe, plans to kill eight Chiang puppet troops. If all one million militia in the area were to eliminate only one invading soldier each in self-defense operations, it is not difficult to imagine how much loss Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous head of the civil war, would suffer.

　　晋冀鲁豫新华分社记者评
    边区民兵自卫两月战绩辉煌
    战线四千里蒋阎军腹背受创
    百万民兵自订战斗计划再接再厉坚持长期自卫
    【邯郸二十八日电】自八月迄今之五十日中晋冀鲁豫边区百万民兵在沿陇海、同蒲、正太、平汉长达四千余里的自卫战线上与八路军并肩作战，予进犯蒋阎军以重大挫伤。晋冀鲁豫新华分社记者评称：这一支不容忽视的反内战劲旅，在实行“耕者有其田”的基础上，进一步发挥了抗战八年中的积极性与顽强性。八月中旬，我军主力发动陇海自卫反击战时，边区人民武装曾配合主力袭入刘峙内战指挥中心之开封南关飞机场，解放全国四大镇之一的朱仙镇，使蒋军陷于腹背受敌。八月十三日，蒋军再犯我同蒲中段解放区，汾南民兵配合正面我军作战，在蒋军侵陷区内，展开广泛的游击攻势，拔除夏县尉郭镇，及临汾之县底镇蒋军卫星据点，迫使蒋军抽出大量兵力回援其后防，九月中旬，我晋南民兵逆敌挺进，奇袭平陆城，收复茅津渡，予北犯蒋军以重大牵制及威胁。记者指出目前民兵作战的一个主要特点：广大民兵常独立担负次要方向的战斗任务，使主力得以集中兵力歼灭敌人。安阳民兵五天内与蚕食进犯的蒋伪军战斗二十次，毙伤蒋伪军二百余名，黄河北岸济源杜八联的水上民兵队，经常在浊浪滔天的黄河里巡逻，将进犯者的船只击翻。在一次战斗中，曾活捉国民党济源县公安局长以下十五人。冀南临漳民兵，配合地方武装创造了一次歼灭进犯伪军全部三百人的辉煌战果，大大鼓舞了农民群众的翻身运动。正太线榆次、太谷、寿阳、平定、井陉及平汉线安阳、汤阴等县民兵，开展冷枪战及爆炸运动，保卫群众秋收秋耕。东沁线民兵配合地方武装困扰阎伪据点，八月解放盘陀，九月解放子洪口，使逃难群众重返家园。赞皇、元氏民兵曾一网打尽潜入两县交界处封山之蒋记特务武装“还乡团”。记者赞扬民兵作战英雄称：太岳平陆西梁村七个民兵与十一倍于己之蒋军作战，打退蒋军三次猛攻，终将其击溃。曲沃马庄常村西阳一带民兵以麻雀战、冷枪战击退两千多阎军的围攻，毙伤阎军三十八名。洪洞民兵英雄创造冷枪和爆炸结合的战术，一次毙伤阎伪二十七名。他们还特别注意了政治作战，汤阴民兵组成许多小型的武装宣传队深入蒋军据点周围进行“攻心战”，使蒋军内部厌战士兵的士气益为低落。记者指出：目前民兵斗争正向更高形式发展，全边区周围已成立了无数的“飞行爆炸组”“报仇组”。王屋县民兵联防成立了“土炮连”。襄陵民兵成立“人民保战队”，把生了锈的土炮抬出来，擦得光亮，很自信的说：“蒋阎军来了一定把这土炮换成美国火器”。的确，他们已在逐步实现自己的计划，太谷民兵缴获了机关枪和小炮，霍县民兵缴获山炮一门，机枪十三挺，掷弹筒九个，步枪一百四十支。该记者结语谓：现在全区民兵都提出了消灭进犯军的计划。沙河民兵英雄郝小三的计划是，打死八个蒋伪军。假若全区百万民兵，人人在自卫作战中只消灭一个进犯军，不难想象，蒋介石这个卖国内战头子将会遭受多大的损失。
