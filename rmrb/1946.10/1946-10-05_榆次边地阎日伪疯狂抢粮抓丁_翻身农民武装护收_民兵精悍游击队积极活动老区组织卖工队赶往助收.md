[Changzhi Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 3rd] As the autumn harvest ripens in Yuchi, Yan's and the Japanese puppets' grain seizure and raid activities have become even more frantic. Since September, over thirty grain seizure raids have been launched. More than 16,000 *shi* of grain have been seized from over twenty villages, including Beitian and Zhuangzi, due to complacency; over a hundred people have been conscripted, and other property losses have also been enormous. On the 19th and 20th, over two hundred of Yan's and the Japanese puppet troops stationed at the Beihelou Railway Station on the Tongpu Railway repeatedly besieged Zhuangzi Village twice. The first siege came up empty, so they immediately withdrew and lay in ambush outside the village. After the masses returned to the village, they suddenly besieged it again, causing great losses to the masses. Fortunately, our militia bravely covered the masses' breakout, resulting in only four deaths and six captures. Recently, Yan's special agents have also been quite active, attempting to nibble away at our area during their autumn grain seizure activities. The stubborn puppet county magistrate held a special agents meeting in Dongyang on the 17th, planning to assassinate our area's village cadres and organize a secret puppet regime. The county headquarters has called on all villages to prepare for long-term combat, widely lay landmines, and blockade all roads to strike at Yan's special agents and small groups of Yan's puppet troops operating at night. The county government has also strengthened current affairs education for the masses, strengthening the masses' fighting spirit and confidence in victory. After the liberation movement, the masses in the new liberated areas are extremely firm. They have clearly seen that Yan Xishan seizes grain, conscripts labor, slaughters, and rapes them; the Communist Party, on the other hand, helps them to liberate themselves. The Eighth Route Army protects their lives and property. They are determined to fight the reactionaries to the end. The old and weak have moved to the old liberated areas, while the young and strong have joined the militia to persist in the struggle. "Unity between the military, government, and people will surely lead to victory" has become their common belief and determination.

[Another Dispatch] The autumn harvest struggle in the border areas of Yuchi has fully unfolded. The county government issued a call for a harvest blitz on the 25th. The elite militia guerrilla units formed by the independent battalion based on the joint defense zone are actively providing cover. More than 25,000 peasants in over seventy villages in the plains area have been organized and started harvesting. The autumn harvest in the mountainous areas of the old liberated areas has not yet ripened. Over twenty villages, including Qingcheng and Huoxian, have organized labor teams to go to the plains area to provide support. The militia explosives experts in the old liberated areas, led by explosives hero Cheng Sungen, have also gone to the plains to assist. The border area militia are setting up extensive minefields to blockade Yan's puppet troops who are seizing the autumn harvest. It is estimated that the entire harvest can be completed in half a month. Most of the county and district cadres have also gone to the villages in the plains to organize both the harvesting and hiding of grain.

　　榆次边地阎日伪疯狂抢粮抓丁
    翻身农民武装护收
    民兵精悍游击队积极活动老区组织卖工队赶往助收
    【本报长治三日电】榆次秋禾成熟，阎日伪之抢粮奔袭活动，亦更加疯狂。九月以来，抢粮出犯已达三十余次。北田、庄子等二十余村，因麻痹而被抢粮达一万六千余石，抓丁百余人，其他财物损失亦巨。十九廿两日，驻同蒲路北合流车站之阎日伪军二百余，反复包围我庄子村两次。第一次包围扑空时，立即退出，埋伏村外，待群众回村后，又突然包围，群众损失甚大。幸我民兵英勇掩护群众突围，仅死四人，被俘六人。最近阎特活动亦颇频繁，企图在其抢秋活动中对我区蚕食。顽伪县长曾于十七日在东阳召开特务会议，布置暗杀我区村干部，组织秘密伪政权。该县指挥部已号召各村长期备战，广泛埋设地雷，封锁一切道路，以打击阎特及小股阎伪军夜间活动。县府也加强对群众的时事教育，坚定群众斗志与胜利信心。经过翻身运动，新区群众极为坚定，他们看清了阎锡山对他们是抢粮、抓丁、屠杀、奸淫；共产党则帮助他们翻身解放。八路军保卫他们的生命财产，决与反动派斗争到底，老弱纷纷转入老区，青壮年均参加民兵，坚持斗争。“军政民团结一致，一定胜利”，已成为他们共同的信心与决心。
    【又讯】榆次边沿区秋收斗争已全面展开。县府于二十五日发出突击秋收号召，独立营以联防区为单位组成的精悍民兵游击队积极掩护。平川地区七十余村二万五千多农民已组织起来，动手收割。老区山地秋禾尚未成熟，庆城霍县等二十余村均已组织卖工队，下平川地区支援。老区民兵爆炸能手在爆炸英雄程三根领导下，也下平川协助，边地民兵大摆地雷阵，封锁抢秋的阎伪。预计半月即可全部收光。县区大部干部亦多赴平川各村，组织一面抢收、一面藏粮。
