　　【Benbao Yangcheng 6th dispatch】The bloody massacre by Jiang's special agents in Wufujian, Yuanqu (for details of the tragedy, see this newspaper's June issue), spurred the rapid growth and expansion of two hundred militiamen. In this battle against the invading Jiang diehard army in Yuanqu, they demonstrated unparalleled tenacity and courage. They conducted five ambushes along the ten-plus li route from Guandian Village (northwest of Gaoluo Town) to Gaoluo Town, delaying the Jiang army's advance by a day and a half. On the morning of August 25th, their field company delivered a head-on blow to a battalion of the diehard 30th Division at Tiegu Mountain in Guandian Village, causing the diehard soldiers to flee in disarray. That afternoon, the diehard army regrouped and returned, only to be driven back to Hei Yukou by more than twenty militiamen with a few grenades. The next morning, when the diehard army realized that they were fighting against only militiamen, they came back with renewed vigor. Six militiamen from × Village saw them, picked up their guns, and charged forward. The diehard army's bullets stirred up yellow dust in front of them, but they showed no fear and shouted at the enemy to "Surrender your guns!" After skirmishing with the enemy for more than two hours, when the Jiang army advanced to Anzi Ridge, they encountered the fourth interception by the ×× Village militia. At noon, the diehard army finally advanced to the river滩 west of Gaoluo Town, probably wanting to show off the "National Army's" might to the people, and marched towards the town in neat four-column formations. Suddenly, the militiamen on the ridge fired a few shots, and the "National Army" immediately fell into chaos, scattering across a cornfield. After several bugle calls, the troops finally gathered, and they fired wildly with light and heavy machine guns for more than an hour. By the time they entered Gaoluo Town, the people had already been evacuated.

　　蒋特血案铭骨难忘
    五福涧民兵痛击蒋军
    五次阻击迟滞蒋军进犯
    【本报阳城六日电】垣曲五福涧蒋特的血腥屠杀（惨案经过详见本报六月所载），促成了二百民兵的迅速成长和壮大。他们在这次蒋顽军进犯垣曲的战斗中，表现了无比的坚强和英勇，从官店村（皋落镇西北）到皋落镇十余里的途中，曾对顽伪进行了五次阻击战，迟滞了蒋军进展的时间一天半。八月廿五日晨，他们一个野战连，在官店村铁固山，给了进攻的顽三十师一个营以迎头痛击，打的顽军狼狈逃窜而回。当天下午，顽军又整军重来，被二十多个民兵，一气赶到黑峪口，仅用几个手榴弹将蒋军击退。次日晨，当顽军弄清楚与他们对抗的全是民兵，便又卷土重来，×村六个民兵看见了，提起枪就往前冲，顽军的枪弹，一阵阵的在他们面前溅起黄土，但他们毫无惧色，还大呼敌人“缴枪”。与敌周旋了两个多钟头，当蒋军前进到鞍子岭时，又碰到了××村民兵的第四次截击。晌午顽军才进展到皋落镇西头河滩上，大概想向老百姓显一下“国军”的威风，整齐的排成四路纵队向镇上走来。忽然岭头上民兵，打来几枪，“国军”立刻混乱了，窜满了一片玉茭地，吹了好几次集合号，队伍才集合起来，用轻重机枪疯狂的打了一个多钟头，当他们进入皋落镇时，老百姓早已转移了。
