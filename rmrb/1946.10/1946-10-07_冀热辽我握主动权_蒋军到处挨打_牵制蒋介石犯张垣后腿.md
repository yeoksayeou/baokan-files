　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: News from Ji-Re-Liao: The initiative in the Ji-Re-Liao war has shifted to the hands of the Eighth Route Army, guerrillas, and militia. Chiang's troops, using the Beining Railway and Jin-Cheng Railway as their base lines, launched multi-pronged attacks on the mountainous areas between Xinglong, Zunhua, Qinglong (Dushan), and Qian'an, attempting to annihilate the main force of the Eighth Route Army, but this has failed. Previously, a high-ranking Chiang Kai-shek military officer admitted that the operational guidance in Ji-Re-Liao made a major strategic error, because the target was too large, and they were busy expanding territory in all directions, dispersing their forces, which left them in a passive and vulnerable position. The isolated points and lines they occupied were precarious. Chiang's troops, deeply penetrating into Rehe, had not yet established a firm foothold when they were counterattacked by the Eighth Route Army on August 25th, losing the occupied Ningcheng and having a regiment wiped out by the Eighth Route Army, about 1,600 men. Qinglong County, on the border of Ji-Re, was seized and retaken by the Eighth Route Army after only three days. The central section of the Jin-Cheng Railway was threatened from time to time, and Chiang's troops being transferred on the Zunhua-Tangshan highway were constantly ambushed by us. On August 22nd, Chiang's troops transferred from Zunhua to Tangshan were ambushed by guerrillas at Sigongzhuang, south of Zunhua. On the 24th, Chiang's troops attempted to sneak again, but were again ambushed by the Eighth Route Army. The military vehicles of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Jixian County, transporting supplies, often delivered gifts to the guerrillas. On August 16th, local armed forces destroyed six transport vehicles of the Chiang Kai-shek Army United Service Headquarters passing through Xiezhuangzi in Jixian County. On the 20th, the Xinggezhuang guerrillas south of Jixian County intercepted a Chiang Kai-shek transport team full of flour and military supplies. According to extremely incomplete statistics for the past month, the area annihilated nearly two regiments of Chiang's troops in more than 20 battles of varying sizes (including one machine gun company, one mortar platoon, and one American-equipped platoon), killing and wounding more than 2,600, capturing more than 800 alive, seizing 64 light and heavy machine guns, more than 680 rifles, more than 66,000 rounds of ammunition, three 60mm mortars and mortars, and shooting down one American fighter plane, recovering Qinglong and Ningcheng and more than ten important towns such as Saheqiao and Yanggezhuang. The peaceful people of eastern Hebei, who have been severely ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, are rising up to defend their homes. In the past month, more than 10,000 militia members have automatically poured into the main force and guerrillas in various parts of eastern Hebei. Young people say, "When Chiang Kai-shek's army comes, there is no hope of studying peacefully anymore." They dropped their books and joined the Eighth Route Army. Women have formed "Women's Bombing Teams" and "Youth Women's Self-Defense Teams" to actively participate in the self-defense war. When the Bengcheng militia ambushed fleeing Chiang's troops, many women with bound feet also came to help with sticks and farm tools. The Eighth Route Army's guerrilla warfare in the mountainous areas has been closely coordinated, adhering to the plain guerrilla warfare in areas such as Sanhe and Xianghe, constantly harassing and attacking the enemy, which has created the necessary conditions for the main force in the heartland to gain time to respond to the enemy. The main force of the Eighth Route Army, which was mobilely withdrawn from Sanhe, Pinggu, and other places, is now actively counterattacking, and has recovered important towns such as Dongyanggezhuang in Shunyi, and cooperated with the Shunyi Guerrilla Brigade to destroy roads along the Pinggu line, restraining Chiang Kai-shek and hampering his attack on Zhangjiakou.

　　冀热辽我握主动权
    蒋军到处挨打
    牵制蒋介石犯张垣后腿
    【新华社延安四日电】冀热辽讯：冀热辽战争的主动权已转入八路军与游击队民兵之手，蒋军以北宁路和锦承路为基线，分路合击兴隆、遵化、青龙（都山）、迁安之间山岳地区，企图聚歼八路军主力，已告失败。前此蒋介石某高级军官自认对冀热辽的作战指导在战略上犯了大错，因为目标太过庞大，忙于四向扩张地盘，兵力分散，使自己处处被动挨打，侵占的孤立点线陷于风雨飘摇之中。孤军深入热中的蒋军，立足未定，八月二十五日即遭八路军反击，丧失已占的宁县城，并被八路军歼灭了一个团，约一千六百人。冀热边境青龙县城，侵陷三天就被八路军夺回。锦承路中段时遭威胁，遵（化）唐（山）公路上调防的蒋军不断中我伏击。八月二十二日，遵化调唐山蒋军被游击队阻击于遵化南思恭庄，二十四日蒋军再度偷窜，又遭八路军阻击。蓟县蒋军输送给养的军用汽车，常常为游击队输送礼物。八月十六日，地方武装击毁行经蓟县谢庄子的蒋军联合勤务总司令部运输汽车六辆。二十日蓟县南邢各庄游击队，截击满载面粉及军用品之蒋军运输队。据一月来极不完全统计，该区仅在大小廿余次战斗中，即歼灭蒋军将近二团（内一机枪连、一迫击炮排、美械一排），毙伤二千六百余，生擒八百余，缴获轻重机枪六十四挺，步枪六百八十余支，子弹六万六千余发，六零式炮及迫击炮各三，击落美式战斗机一架，光复县城青龙、宁城两城及撒河桥、杨各庄等重镇十余处。痛遭蒋军蹂躏的冀东和平人民，正奋起保卫家乡，一月来冀东各地自动涌进主力军和游击队的民兵即达万人以上。青年们说：“蒋介石军来了，再也不要指望安心读书了。”丢掉书本，投奔八路军。妇女们自行组织“妇女爆炸组”、“青妇自卫队”等，积极参加自卫战争。倴城民兵伏击逃窜之蒋军时，许多小脚妇女亦手持棍棒农具，赶来助战；八路军山岳地区游击战争已密切的配合起来，坚持三河、香河等地区的平原游击战，时时困扰袭击敌人，这就给腹心战区主力部队赢得时间相机制敌的必要条件。机动撤离三河、平谷等地之八路军主力，现正活跃反击，已收复顺义东杨各庄等重镇，并配合顺义游击大队，对平古线一带破路，牵制蒋介石进攻张家口的后腿。
