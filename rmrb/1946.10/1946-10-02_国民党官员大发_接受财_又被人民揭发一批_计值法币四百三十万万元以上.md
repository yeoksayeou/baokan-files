Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Kuomintang receiving officials' corruption cases have recently been exposed by the people once again. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount reaches 4.3 million trillion Legal Tender Yuan; in addition, there are a large number of real estate and property items that cannot be valued temporarily. In Shanghai alone, the number of houses accepted by the Executive Yuan reached more than 8,000, most of which were occupied by military personnel. Currently, He Yingqin's name is prominently listed among the top ten in the Shanghai property tax figures, indicating the extent of his property plunder. When the New First Army was in Guangzhou, it also "confiscated" a large number of materials. Exposed cases include 4,000 boxes of opium worth over 500 million yuan. In addition, Mo Yushuo, a special commissioner of the Military and Political Department in Guangzhou, colluded with warehouse manager Li Jingting to steal 177 boxes of opium, worth over 22 billion yuan. The Hankou Enemy and Puppet Materials Administration embezzled 139 boxes of opium, worth over 17 billion yuan. Chen Zhi, the head of the Second Regiment of the Third War Area's Transport Corps, and the Traffic Management Bureau "lost" 19 cars and the engines and steering wheels of 81 cars, totaling 2 billion yuan. The Wuhan Jianghai Customs colluded with unscrupulous merchants to auction off goods at low prices, embezzling 1 billion yuan. Of the 150 enemy warships received by the Guangzhou Special Commissioner's Office of the Navy Department, the engines of all of them were stolen and sold, leaving only the hulls. The people of Guangzhou call this "casting off the golden cicada's shell." Wei Bingrong, the chief of the Guangzhou Police Bureau, hid nearly 100 million yuan worth of materials in the Guangdong Provincial Bank. Even Xu Enyu, the director of the Wuhan branch of the Central News Agency, took advantage of the chaos to steal a large number of materials and make a fortune through "acceptance."
