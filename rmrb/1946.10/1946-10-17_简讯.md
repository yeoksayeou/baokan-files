Brief News
　　On September 21st, Zanhuang held a public trial of Hu Hai, a criminal involved in counterfeit Hebei banknotes. The criminal was an intelligence agent for the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang. In July, he sneaked 4,000 yuan of counterfeit Hebei banknotes into the liberated areas to sabotage the financial system and disrupt the market. He was recently apprehended at a shop in Gaoyi Railway Station when the shop assistant noticed that the large package of brand-new Hebei banknotes he carried was substantial and suspected his behavior, so he reported it to the government. In addition to specializing in selling counterfeit banknotes in our area, the criminal also probed for military intelligence, distributed reactionary leaflets, and created "change of dynasty" rumors. The masses were extremely resentful. The government immediately dealt with him according to the law at the public trial.
