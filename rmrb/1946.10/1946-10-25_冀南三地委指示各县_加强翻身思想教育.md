　　Ji'nan Third Prefectural Committee Directs All Counties
    Strengthen Education on Emancipation Thought
    [This newspaper's Weixian News] The Propaganda Department of the Ji'nan Third Prefectural Committee recently instructed all counties to mobilize all propaganda forces to strengthen mass education on emancipation thought, in order to rapidly realize "land to the tiller." The instructions stated: The work in this regard is weak due to the slackening of mass education on emancipation. Specific stipulations include: 1. All counties should publish mass emancipation newspapers and emancipation victory reports, etc. 2. At any time and any place, according to the changes in the masses' thinking and the crimes of the landlords, compile teaching materials suitable for the masses' tastes to educate the masses. 3. Improve and establish village broadcasting stations and mass blackboards. In addition to the current situation, victory news, and materials for joining the army and participating in the war, the content should focus on the masses' emancipation. Broadcast and introduce a large amount of information to the masses based on the emancipation newspapers and local deeds. 4. Regularly summarize the ideological changes of the masses at all levels in the struggle and strengthen the guidance of educational work. 5. National education should propose "all primary schools in the region participate in the emancipation movement," carry out emancipation propaganda work, lay the foundation for children to serve the working people, and transform and improve the level of education. 6. Strengthen communication and reporting to the Ji'nan Daily, People's Daily, and other newspapers, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and use newspapers to promote work. This point has been the worst in the past, and must be greatly improved in the future.

　　冀南三地委指示各县
    加强翻身思想教育
    【本报威县讯】冀南三地委宣传部最近指示各县，动员一切宣传力量，加强群众翻身思想教育，以迅速实现“耕者有其田”，指示中称：由于放松了群众翻身教育，造成这一工作的薄弱。具体规定：一、各县出群众翻身小报和翻身捷报等。二、随时随地根据群众思想变化和地主的罪恶，编制适合群众口味的教材教育群众。三、健全与建立各村广播台与大众黑板，内容上除了时局、胜利消息、参军参战材料外，就是群众翻身的事。根据翻身小报等材料及本村事迹，大量向群众广播介绍。四、经常总结各阶层群众在斗争中的思想变化，加强教育工作的指导。五、国民教育，提出“全区小学参加翻身运动”，进行翻身宣传工作，打下儿童为劳动人民服务的观念，改造与提高教育水平。六、加强对冀南日报、人民日报等通讯报导，及时交流经验，并运用报纸推动工作。这点过去最差，今后要大力改进。
