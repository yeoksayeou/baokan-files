　　[This dispatch from our Yangcheng office, dated the 16th] The powerful local corps and militia guerrilla forces, under the command of General Wang Yong, commander of the Third Military Sub-district of Taiyue, and Comrade Chai Zemin, political commissar, gallop behind the enemy lines of Jiang's army in southern Shanxi, and have now recovered vast areas. From late August to September 25, our local corps, in conjunction with militia guerrillas, successively shattered three "mopping-up" operations launched by Jiang's army against the mountainous areas of Wenxi and Xiaxian. Then, taking advantage of the victory, we launched a counterattack. In just five days, from September 26 to 30, we successively recovered more than 20 strongholds, including Hedi, Jiangnie, Shangxia Fengcun, Cuijiahe, and Huzhang (all located 35 to 40 li southeast of Wenxi), as well as vast areas on both sides of the Zhangmao Highway, pressing towards the suburbs of Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Pinglu. Most of the vast territory of the liberated areas in southern Shanxi, which had been occupied by Jiang's stubborn troops since July, has been re-liberated. Currently, Jiang's army has been compressed onto the communication lines, and the strongholds of Wenxi, Guodi, Shuitou, Xiaxian, Wangyukou, and Zhangdian are also under the day and night siege and harassment of our local military and civilians.

　　[This dispatch from our Yangcheng office, dated the 16th] In the Fen River-Yellow River coastal area of Taiyue, the people's self-defense guerrilla warfare is gaining momentum. The mass guerrilla force in the Jiwangshan area crushed two large-scale mopping-up operations by Jiang's army in September, killing or wounding more than 30 Jiang army officers and soldiers. The guerrilla force also penetrated deep into the Yuncheng suburbs, an important rear base of Jiang's army in southern Shanxi. On the 24th, it attacked Taoshang Village, 10 li northwest of Yuncheng, eliminating more than 20 Jiang army special agents and armed personnel. The Jiang army in Yuncheng was greatly shocked and kept the city gates tightly closed every day, forbidding residents from entering or leaving.

　　[This dispatch from our Yangcheng office, dated the 16th] The militia in the border areas of Yi (cheng), Jiang (xian), and Qin (shui) counties implemented joint defense and formed elite guerrilla groups to operate near Jiang's army strongholds. In the ten days of late September, they fought more than 20 battles, inflicting more than 100 casualties on Jiang's army and controlling more than 20 villages such as Heshui, Xuluyu, and Baima in the border area of Yi (cheng) and Jiang (xian).
