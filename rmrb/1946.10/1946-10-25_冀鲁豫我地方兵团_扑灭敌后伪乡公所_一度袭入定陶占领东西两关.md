　　JiluYu Local Military Group
    Eradicates Enemy-Backed Puppet Township Offices
    Briefly Raids and Occupies the East and West Gates of Dingtao
    [Reported from JiluYu on the 22nd of this month] The rear areas of Heze, Dingtao, and the Jiang troops' occupied areas in eastern Henan are weakly defended. Our local military groups, militia, and guerrillas are becoming increasingly active behind enemy lines. Our certain local military group raided Dingtao city on the evening of the 9th, occupying the east and west gates. On the 8th, our Heze backbone armed forces attacked the Jieyuanji puppet township office southwest of the city. On the same day, a unit of our eastern Henan guerrilla group raided the Zhangqiao puppet town office northwest of Zhecheng, resolving the battle in ten minutes. That night, they took advantage of the victory and resolved the Bogang puppet township office northwest of Zhecheng. On the 3rd, Ding Guangtai, the reconnaissance company commander of our certain unit, independently intercepted a Jiang military vehicle on the Shangqiu-Zhecheng highway, killing or wounding seven Jiang officers and soldiers. On the 9th, Comrade Xi Yujie, a probationary staff officer of our certain detachment, led several scouts and intercepted two Jiang military vehicles near Guanyintang west of Shangqiu. The detachment immediately used the vehicles to rush to attack the Tongtang town office southeast of Shangqiu. After completing the mission, our soldiers sang war songs and returned to their original defense positions by car. In summary, the results of the above seven battles include killing or wounding more than 40 enemies, capturing more than 30, and seizing three cars and bicycles each, two telephones, one warhorse, more than 70 rifles, two short guns, and 1,600 rounds of ammunition.
