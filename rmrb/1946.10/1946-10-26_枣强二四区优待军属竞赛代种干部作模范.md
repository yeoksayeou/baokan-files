　　【Our Newspaper, Weixian News】The Second and Fourth Districts of Zaoqiang, Jinnan, are paying attention to the work of supporting military families. After the Second District held an expanded meeting of village cadres, villages enthusiastically launched a competition to ensure a thorough solution to the difficulties of military families. Within two days, the entire district cultivated 565 mu of wheat fields on behalf of military families and resolved more than 60 difficulties for them. In the Fourth District, village cadres played a exemplary role in supporting military families. Jujiazhuang did the best. Ju Dianting, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, often went to the fields to solicit the opinions of military families. This year, the millet of the military families entered their homes early, and all the wheat fields were cultivated.
