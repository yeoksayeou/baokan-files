Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Chongqing report: With the support of worker brothers and democratic individuals across the country and the world, the 22 arrested employees of the Labor Association were released successively between the 12th and 16th of last month, achieving a preliminary victory. They were warmly welcomed and慰问 by all sectors of Chongqing. However, the occupied institutions of the Labor Association have not yet been returned. Employees of the association unanimously expressed their determination to continue the struggle and persist until complete victory. The Labor Association Workers' Welfare Society also hosted reporters on the 16th, putting forward three demands: immediately return all occupied Labor Association institutions, the court should immediately determine what crimes they committed, and the "General Labor Union" must immediately return all privately and otherwise deposited items and money. It is reported that the various opportunities of the Chongqing Labor Association were forcibly "taken over" by the "General Labor Union" employed by the Chiang government on August 6th. At that time, 38 people were arrested, and 16 were released.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Chongqing report: The local branch of the Democratic League, the Three People's Principles League, the Democratic Political Advancement Association, the Chinese Literature Association, the Chongqing Women's Federation, the Chongqing Youth Federation and 11 other organizations jointly held a rally on the 21st of last month to welcome the victorious release of the Labor Association employees. Zhou Ying, director of the Labor Welfare Society, and others reported on the occupation of the Labor Association and their life in prison. Deng Chumin and Huang Cixian were both invited to speak. In the written welcome message from the seventeen organizations, they called on the people of the country and the workers of the country to continue to unite, insist on demanding a thorough and reasonable solution to this incident, demand that the government immediately return the original institutions, compensate for the losses, and severely punish the perpetrators. They also stated: The Labor Association incident "demonstrated the darkness and shamelessness of the reactionary forces, but also demonstrated that the power of the people cannot be underestimated, and the sanctity of people's organizations is inviolable."
