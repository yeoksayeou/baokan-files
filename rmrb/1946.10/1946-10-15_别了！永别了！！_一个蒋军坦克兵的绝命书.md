　　Farewell! Farewell Forever!!
    ——A Kuomintang Tank Soldier's Death Note
    In early September, during the battle of Da Lizhai in the Heze area, the Eighth Route Army captured a self-description and three diaries written by Second Lieutenant Chen Huai, a driver from the Kuomintang Army's Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army). The following is the last paragraph of the self-description:
    "Now we have received orders to attack the Communist Army in North China. Before departing, the commanding officer instructed: 'Obey orders and eliminate the Communist bandits.' We have suffered several defeats in the past, and this time we must fight well. If we don't fight well this time, Marshal Marshall will punish us!' Alas, I really don't understand what the difference is between ××× (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) and Wang Jingwei. This time going to North China, I am going with the intention of dying. I heard that the Communist Army's combat effectiveness is extremely strong, and the war is uncertain. It is hard to say whether I will survive this war. But what can I do? Farewell, my comrades, farewell forever!"
    According to another captured armored vehicle driver, Chen Huai's tank was destroyed by the Eighth Route Army using captured American rocket launchers, and Chen Huai had made a futile sacrifice.

　　别了！永别了！！
    ——一个蒋军坦克兵的绝命书
    九月初，荷泽地区大李寨战斗中，八路军缴获了蒋军第三师（原十军）中尉驾驶员陈怀写的一篇自述和三本日记，下面是自述中的最后一段：
    “现在我们已奉到命令向华北共产军进攻，临行前长官训示：“‘服从命令，消灭共匪’，过去我们遭受了几次失败，这次一定要打好，这次如果再打不好，马歇尔元帅就要处罚我们了”！唉，我真不懂×××（意指蒋介石）和汪精卫到底有什么区别，这次到华北去，我是抱着送死的心情去的，听说共产军战斗力极为旺盛，战争是没有把握的，这次战争能否生还是很难说的。但这有什么办法呢？别了，我的战友们，永远的别了”！
    据另一个被俘的装甲车驾驶员说：陈怀驾驶的坦克车已被八路军用缴获的美国火箭炮击毁，陈怀已作了无谓的牺牲。
