            Scared Away the Tanks
    On the morning of September 6th, the remnants of the enemy at Dayang Lake were breaking out. Five airplanes were circling in the air, and three tanks were on the ground to meet the escaping enemy.
    Commander Wu, who was stationed in Xiaoyang Lake, immediately ordered his three battalions to attack, and a fierce battle unfolded in an open area. The heroic Ninth Company chased directly after the tanks. The enemy in the tanks, seeing they were being pursued, turned around and ran away in a panic, without even returning fire. "Lay down your arms, brothers! Confess and live!" The enemy who were running stopped, some turning their rifles upside down. A platoon leader, armed with an empty Mauser pistol, drove a squad of enemies, shouting, "If you don't surrender, I'll kill you all right here." Enemies carrying two light machine guns threw down their guns, and then he carried two light machine guns and several rifles back by himself. Of the more than one hundred enemies who broke out, thirty were taken prisoner. The Second Battalion of the 58th Regiment captured three light machine guns, as well as a Type 92 heavy machine gun, and all the rifles were Mausers. The 58th Regiment only suffered two minor injuries. Commander Wu, returning from the pursuit, said, "Such a cheap victory, this is the first time."
            I've Taken My Revenge
    After the main force of the 3rd Reorganized Division was annihilated, the 74th Division, stationed in Cao County, was also annihilated. Its 222nd Regiment headquarters and one battalion were wiped out on the night of the 8th. More than two hundred enemies were taken prisoner, more than one hundred and fifty were killed or wounded, and fifteen machine guns and ten small cannons, and more than two hundred rifles became our spoils of victory.
    Comrade Wang Yuchen was wounded in his left arm in this battle. He didn't sit on a stretcher; he walked to the medical team himself. Although it was six or seven *li* from the medical team, he showed no sign of pain. He said, "My third and fourth uncles were both killed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the past! My father was beaten by Chiang's troops and died of fright! My family's hatred is great." He fought bravely in this battle, killing three or four enemies who were firing back at him. He said excitedly, "I've taken my revenge. Although I was injured, I feel very honored. This is for the people, and also for myself."
            Now I Have a Home
    In the drizzling morning, our pursuing troops arrived at Guoxiaohu, a small village on the border of Dingtao. Before the troops entered the village, the people knew that the Eighth Route Army was coming, and they shouted to their families in the fields, "Go home, our troops are here! It's the Eighth Route Army." In half an hour, the streets of Guoxiaohu were full of people. An old man, with a pipe in his mouth, said with a smile, "Our village has never been so lively!" A place where you couldn't even find a rice bowl half an hour ago is now surrounded by a joyful atmosphere and cooking smoke.
    Li, the chairwoman of the Women's Association, took the pot out of the stove hole. She also dug out two golden pumpkins from the wheat bran pile. Within half an hour, fragrant and sweet pumpkin rice was made. Her grandson was clamoring to eat, Li said, "Little one, let the comrades eat first. If they eat their fill, they can fight well and drive away the traitors, then we will have a home!" She scooped the rice into bowls and went to the upper room to greet some comrades, saying, "You must eat a meal, or you'll be letting me down. Comrades, in the days you've been gone, we the people have felt like we have no support! Now that you're here, we have a home."
            Old Woman Wang Prays for the Eighth Route Army's Victory
    The enemy at Xiaoyang Lake were annihilated, and the enemy at Dayang Lake were annihilated. The Western Route enemy and Cao Fulin's troops in the Central Route, who had not been annihilated, retreated to Kaocheng.
    We were chasing the enemy in a tense manner, with no time to sleep or eat. A battalion of the 3rd Reorganized Division, which had retreated, was surrounded in Zhifang, in the first district of Kaocheng, on the night of September 8th. Our 58th Regiment was in Duancun, one *li* west of Zhifang. The troops were being mobilized, and the support staff were busy cooking and doing other logistical work. We stayed at the lowest house in Duancun. The landlord's house was also full of troops and refugees. The old landlady didn't feel bothered at all, and even scrambled to help with cooking and boiling water. As long as it was work she could do, she wouldn't let the comrades of the troops do it. When she was free, I talked to her, and she told me, "Old brother, before you came, I prayed for the Eighth Route Army to win the battle and kill all of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. This time, the Eighth Route Army has finally arrived."
        Triumphant Mid-Autumn Festival
    After the main forces of the 3rd Reorganized Division, the 41st Division, and the 47th Division were annihilated, we were ordered to rest in the base area.
    On the Mid-Autumn Festival night, it was drizzling. We returned from the front line, our clothes soaked all the way. When we arrived at Dazhanglou, on the border of Heze, Secretary Li gently patted the door of a house and then called out, "Landlord, it's the 58th Regiment." The landlord immediately opened the door, "Comrade, you must be tired. Hurry up and come into the house to rest, your clothes are all soaked!" The old woman lit the fire. Little Zhang Gui was so tired that he fell asleep there. The old woman took off her jacket and put it on him, afraid he would get cold. The old man said to me, "Comrade, the August 15th Festival is here, and we also have a home, we must have a drink." He dug out a bottle of liquor that he had buried, and grabbed a chicken from the chicken coop, telling his daughter-in-law to kill it and stir-fry some snacks. While drinking, she told the story of how they had emptied their houses and fields after the Eighth Route Army left. Secretary Li also told him the story of fighting back against the enemy. The old woman also made noodles and sesame cakes and sent them over. Full and with blankets, we arrived in the liberated area, as happy as if we had been thrown into our mother's arms.

　　战地琐记
    勇进
            吓跑了坦克
    九月六日上午，大杨湖的残敌往外突围了。空中有五架飞机在盘旋，地上有三辆坦克来迎接突围的敌人。
    住在小杨湖的吴团长，马上令他的三个营出击了，在一块开阔地带展开了激战。英勇的九连直向着坦克追击，坦克车上的敌人见追上来了，仓惶的回头就跑，连枪也没还。“缴枪呀，弟兄们！缴枪不杀。”正在往前跑着的敌人停止了，有的将大盖枪倒竖起来，一个排长自己赶着一班敌人，拿着一支没有子弹的盒子枪，他喊着：“要不缴枪，我都打死你在这里。”带着两挺歪把子机枪的敌人，将机枪丢下，于是他一个人扛着两挺歪把和几支步枪回来了。突击出来的一百多敌人，三十个当了俘虏。五十八团二营得了三挺歪把，还有一挺九二式重机枪，步枪一律都是大盖了。而五十八团只有两名轻伤，吴团长追击回来说：“这样便宜的事呀，还是第一次。”
            我可报了仇
    整三师大部被消灭后，住在曹县的七十四师接着也被消灭。它的二二二团的团部和一个营，在八号的夜里被消灭了。敌人二百余人作了俘虏，伤亡了一百五十余人，十五挺机枪和十门小炮，二百余支步枪作了我们的胜利品。
    王于臣同志在这次左臂被打伤了，他不坐担架，他是自己走到卫生队的。虽然离卫生队六、七里路，但他，没有表现丝毫的痛苦，他说：“我三叔和四叔，都是过去叫蒋介石的队伍打死的！我父亲是被老蒋的部队打了一顿，吓死的！我家的仇大了”。他在这次战斗中报了奋勇，在前方一直打死了三、四个向他还击的敌人，他兴奋的说：“我可报了仇，我虽然受了伤，但我觉得很光荣，这是为了老百姓，也是为了自己。”
            俺可有了家
    在细雨蒙蒙的早晨，我们的追击部队到了郭小湖，是定陶边境不大的一个村庄，部队没进村时，老百姓知道是八路军来了，在地里喊着自家的人“回家吧，咱的队伍来啦！是八路军。”有半个钟头的功夫，郭小湖的街上站满了人，一个老大爷口里含着烟袋笑着说：“俺这庄上从来没有这样热闹哩！”在半点钟前连个饭碗找不到的地方，现在却被欢乐的空气和炊烟燎绕着。
    妇救会长李大娘把锅从炕洞里拿出来，她又从麦糠堆里扒出了两个金黄的大南瓜，在半个钟头内，又香又甜的南瓜饭做出来了，她的孙子闹着要吃，李大娘说：“小，先叫同志们吃吧，吃饱了好打仗，打跑了汉奸就有家啦！”她把饭盛到碗里，到上屋去招呼几个同志说：“无论如何也得吃顿饭，你要不吃，就对不起我。同志，你走这几天，我们老百姓就觉得没依靠！你这一来俺可有家了。”
            盼八路王老太太许供
    小杨湖的敌人被消灭了，大杨湖的敌人被消灭了。没有被消灭的西路敌人及中路曹福林的部队，都向考城溃退下去了。
    我们在紧张的追击着敌人，睡觉的空、吃饭的空都没有。溃退下去的整三师的一个营，于九月八日的夜被围困在考城一区的纸房。我们的五十八团就在纸房的西边一里的段村。部队在作动员，杂务人员忙着做饭和其他战勤工作。我们住到段村最下头的一家，房东家里也住满了部队与逃难的客人，房东老太太丝毫不觉得麻烦，还抢着帮助作饭、烧水，只要是她能作的活，她就不叫部队的同志作，我在她空闲的时候，与她谈话，她告我说：“老大哥，你们没来时，我就许下了供叫八路军打胜仗，把蒋介石的队伍都打死，这回八路军可被盼来了。”
        凯旋中秋节
    整三师、四十一师、四十七师大部被消灭后，我们即奉命到根据地休息。
    中秋夜下着蒙蒙的雨，我们从前线回来了，一路上衣服都湿透了，到荷泽边境的大张楼，李书记轻轻的拍了拍一家的大门，然后喊了声：“房东，是我五十八团来了。”房东马上开了大门，“同志，你可辛苦了，赶快到屋里去歇歇吧，衣服都湿透了！”大娘把火弄着了，小张桂累得倒在那里睡着了，老太太将自己身上的袄脱下来，盖在他身上，怕冻着他了。老大爷对我说：“同志，八月十五来了，俺也有家了，可得喝一场。”他把埋起来的一瓶烧酒扒出来，又从鸡窝里抓出一只鸡，叫他儿媳妇杀了，炒下酒菜，喝酒时她拉起八路军走后她们空舍清野的故事，李书记也给他拉了反击敌人的故事。老大娘又做了面条和芝麻饼送来，吃饱了，又有了盖的，我们到了解放区，像投入了母亲的怀里一样的欢乐。
