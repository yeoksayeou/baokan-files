[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 20th] Following the participation of 3,000 young people in the army in Feicheng and Taixi counties, Boping, Chiping, Pingyin, Dong'a and other counties have also set off a vigorous upsurge in joining the army, with cadres and the masses vying to join the Emancipation Campaign Corps. At a meeting of activists in Boping County, Comrade Liu Zhenqi of the County Party Committee took the lead in enlisting in the army and called for the establishment of the Boping Brothers Emancipation Corps, which was enthusiastically joined by various groups. Tang Xirun, a leader in the Second District, took the lead in joining the army and called for the establishment of an Emancipation Battalion. Wang Xidai, a representative from the Third District, took the lead and called for the establishment of an Emancipation Company. Wang Jingchun, a model squad leader from × Village, called for the establishment of an Emancipation Platoon. In just four days, the first batch of more than 700 people had enlisted in the army. In the Chiping new recruit reception center, there are already 250 people, formed into an Emancipation Battalion, led by Ma Guanying, the director of the Armed Forces Committee from the Second District, who enlisted in the army, and Comrade Chi Yankun, the director of the Federation who took the lead in enlisting in the army from the First District, as the political commissar. In the anti-civil war mobilization meeting in the Sixth District of Pingyin, groups were formed to deliberate, trace the roots of poverty, dig out the rich seedlings, pour out grievances, and recall their own emancipation process. Then find typical examples and directly lament their suffering. In the end, everyone's hatred for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek was strengthened, and everyone scrambled to join the main force. Some guaranteed their sons to the battlefield; some sent their nephews and younger brothers to the front; some directors of farmers' associations and model squad leaders took the lead in joining the army, forming a heated competition. As a result, each large group put forward the slogan of an Emancipation Company, and the four large groups in the entire district formed an Emancipation Battalion. At a meeting of activists in the Fourth District, district cadres Comrade Zhang Jiancun, Liu Yongqing of the Armed Forces Committee, and five village cadres took the lead in joining the army. Li Luhui, director of the Anti-Japanese Association of the Second District, and Song Jianlin, director of the Armed Forces Committee, led nine young people to join the army. The conscription movement in Dong'a County is also booming.

[Pingshun News] In the surging wave of people in the border area rising up to join the army for self-defense, more than 400 demobilized soldiers in Pingshun automatically rejoined their ranks and returned to the front line of the patriotic war. Feng Quancai, a demobilized soldier from Wujing Village, who also registered to rejoin the army at the same time, said when he rejoined the army: "I heard that Chiang Kai-shek is coming to attack the Liberated Areas and seize our revolutionary fruits. I feel uneasy at home. If we don't rise up to defend the Liberated Areas, who will defend them?" These returning soldiers have received warm care and love from the peasants. In addition to guaranteeing them land to till and taking care of their families, the farmers also brought them eggs, towels, and various foods and supplies to encourage them to kill more enemies and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the places they attack. The returning soldiers unanimously stated, "We will not go home until the Chiang Kai-shek troops are eliminated!"

　　博平等县干部带领下
    大批青壮拥入翻身营团
    平顺四百余退伍军人自动归队
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】继肥城、泰西县三千青年参军之后，博平、茌平、平阴、东阿等县，亦掀起如火如荼的参军热潮，干部与群众争先恐后拥入翻身营团。博平在全县活动分子会上，县委刘振歧同志，首先慷慨从军，并号召成立博平兄弟翻身团，各团体群众争相参加；二区小区领袖唐锡润带头参军，号召成立翻身营；三区小区代表王希岱带头，号召成立一个翻身连；×屯模范班长王景春号召成立一个翻身排。在短短的四天中，第一批参军者已达七百余名。茌平新兵招待所内，已有二百五十人，编成了一个翻身营，由二区参军的武委会主任马冠英任营长，一区带头参军的联合会主任迟延坤同志任政委。平阴六区于反内战动员大会上，分组酝酿，追穷根，挖富苗，倒苦水，回想自己的翻身过程。然后再找典型，当场诉苦，诉到最后，每个人都增强了对卖国贼蒋介石的仇恨，大家争先要求参加主力军。有的保证儿子上战场；有的送侄子和弟弟到前方；有的农会主任和模范班长带头参军，形成了热烈的竞赛。结果每个大组提出一个翻身连的口号，全区四个大组，共组成一个翻身营。在四区积极分子会上，区干部张建村同志、武委会刘永庆同志及五名村干部带头参军。二区抗联主任李鲁辉、武委会主任宋建林率领九个青年参军。东阿县的参军运动亦蓬勃开展。
    【平顺讯】在边区人民奋起参军自卫的汹涌浪潮中，平顺四百余退伍战士自动归队，重新走上爱国战争前线。与他们同时报名要求归队的，五井村退伍军人冯全才在归队时说：“听说蒋介石来进攻解放区，要夺取我们革命的果实，我在家立坐不安，咱不起来保卫解放区，该谁保卫。这些归队战士，均获得农民热烈关怀与爱护。农民除保证给他们代耕土地及照顾家属外，并拿着鸡蛋、手巾等各种吃的用的送给他们，鼓励他们多多杀敌，把蒋伪军消灭在他们进攻的地方。归队战士则一致表示“不消灭蒋伪军不回家”！
