[Reported from the JiluYu Frontline, October 11th] After inflicting heavy damage on Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops, the 5th Army and the 11th Reorganized Division (18th Army) along the Heze-Juye Highway, the Eighth Route Army is now gradually forming an encirclement, compressing these two advancing forces into a small area on the east and west banks of the Zhuwei River, in order to annihilate them in the end. After Chiang's troops captured the empty city of Heze on the 22nd of last month, they advanced northeast along the Heze-Jining Highway with the 5th Army and the 11th Reorganized Division, attempting to capture Juye in one fell swoop, and then occupy Jiaxiang County, linking up with the Chiang puppet troops stationed in Jining to connect the Heze-Jining Highway. However, under the constant attacks of our army, the Chiang troops only advanced eighty miles in ten days from the 24th to the 4th. The left-wing 5th Army pushed along the highway to Shatuji, Wenlou, and Lugai (about sixty miles from Heze and sixty miles from Juye). The other route pushed along the west bank of the Zhuwei River to Wenlou and Changlou, attempting to encircle and capture the military stronghold of Longguiji (about eighty miles from Heze and forty miles from Juye). Our defending troops calmly responded and fought bravely all night. The 45th Division of the Chiang army was mostly wiped out, and the 96th Division was severely damaged. Our army took advantage of the victory to recover the villages of Wenlou and Lugai, and the advancing 5th Army retreated in a panic to the Shatuji area within our new encirclement. According to preliminary statistics, in the battle around Longguiji, the Chiang Kai-shek 5th Army's 45th Division suffered about 2,500 casualties, and as many as 500 bodies were abandoned on the battlefield. Its right-wing 11th Reorganized Division advanced along the east bank of the Zhuwei River to the Zhangfengji area, and then concentrated superior forces to attack Dajiji, Sunguantun and other places, but were repelled by our defending troops. After eliminating a company and a mortar platoon of its vanguard 11th Brigade (formerly the 11th Division), it attacked Zhangfengji, the village where the headquarters of the 11th Brigade was stationed, on the 5th, and routed its 31st Regiment. Another regiment ordered to reinforce was also repelled by us. Nearby Chiang troops fled at the sound of the wind and were surrounded by us in the Hongshawo area. Currently, our army is tightening the encirclement and continuing to expand the results. In the past week, our army along the Heze-Juye Highway has killed and wounded more than 2,700 Chiang troops, captured four American-made small cannons, four rocket launchers, six anti-tank guns, seventeen heavy machine guns, seventy-four light machine guns, over a thousand rifles, two hundred 6cm caliber small cannon shells, and over two hundred thousand rounds of rifle bullets. Now, the Chiang 5th Army and the 11th Reorganized Division are facing a desperate situation.

　　荷巨公路我军逐渐形成包围
    进犯蒋军面临绝境
    一周来我已歼蒋军二千七百
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十一日电】荷（泽）巨（野）公路沿线八路军，予蒋介石精锐部队第五军，整编十一师（十八军）以重创后，现正逐渐形成包围，分别将这两股进犯军压缩在潴水河东西两岸的狭小地带内，以便最后聚歼。蒋军自上月二十二日陷我荷泽空城后，即以第五军及整十一师沿荷（泽）济（宁）公路向东北犯，企图一举攻占我巨野，再占我嘉祥县城，与占驻济宁蒋伪军联成一气贯通荷（泽）济（宁）公路，但在我军不断打击下，蒋军自二十四日至四日十天内只前进了八十里，其左翼第五军一路沿公路线推至沙土集、文楼、路垓一带（距荷泽约六十里，距巨野约六十里。）另一路沿潴水河西岸推至文楼常楼一带，企图夹击攻取军事要点龙＠集（距荷泽约八十，距巨野四十里），我守军沉着应战，奋勇战斗彻夜不停，蒋军四十五师大部被消灭，九十六师受重创，我军乘胜恢复文楼、路垓两村，进犯之第五军狼狈退至沙土集一带我军新包围圈内。据初步统计战果，龙＠集外围之战，蒋介石第五军四十五师伤亡约二千五百余人，仅遗弃在战场上的尸首即达五百具之多。其右翼整十一师沿潴水河东岸推进至张凤集一带，复集结优势兵力进犯我大义集，孙官屯等地，均为我守军击退，继消灭其先头部队十一旅（原十一师）一个连与一个机炮排之后，五日攻入十一旅旅部驻村张凤集，将其三十一团击溃，其另一团奉命来援亦被我打退，附近蒋军闻风窜逃，旋被我包围于红沙窝一带，现我军正紧缩包围继续扩大战果中。一周来，荷（泽）巨（野）公路沿线我军共毙伤蒋军二千七百余人，缴获美造小炮四门，火箭炮四门，战防炮六门，重机枪十七挺，轻机枪七十四挺，步枪千余支，六公分口径小炮弹二百发，步枪子弹二十余万发。现蒋军第五军及整十一师已面临绝境。
