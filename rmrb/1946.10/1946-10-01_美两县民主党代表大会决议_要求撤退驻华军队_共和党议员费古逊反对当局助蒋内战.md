　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: TASS, New York reported: The American Democratic Far East Policy Committee notified newspapers on the 26th that the Democratic Party organizations' party congresses of two counties in Washington State have decided to demand the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China. The resolution stated: The United States must stop aiding one side of the Chinese civil war, and must guarantee that the people of Pacific countries have the right to establish their own governments and implement domestic reforms according to their will. The congress also decided to include in the party's foreign policy program a resolution to "resolutely use all means to oppose the 'national bloc' policy advocated by Churchill and other reactionaries around the world, aimed at provoking a world war."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th, reported that Republican Senator Ferguson of Michigan, while investigating the storage of surplus military materials, opposed the United States using surplus materials to aid the Chiang Kai-shek government. He questioned Major General Connelley, chairman of the Foreign Surplus Materials Liquidation Committee, saying, "Are we allowing China to use our planes and our airmen to train Chinese pilots for the defense of the two hemispheres?" He pointed out that the Military Aid to China Act had not yet been approved by Congress, and asked, "Does the US government intend to undertake this military aid program before it has been approved by Congress?"

    【新华社延安二十八日电】法新闻处华盛顿十七日电称：密执安州共和党参议员费古逊，在调查剩余军事物资储藏时，反对美国以剩余物资援助蒋介石政府。他质问国外剩余物资清算委员会主席康尼利少将说：“我们允许中国使用我们的飞机和我们的航空员去训练中国驾驶员，这难道是为了两半球的防御吗？”他指出军事援华法案尚未为国会所批准后质问说：“美政府是否意欲在未经国会批准之前即担承此项军事援助纲领呢？”
