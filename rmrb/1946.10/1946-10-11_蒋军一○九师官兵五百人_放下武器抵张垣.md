Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th -- More than 500 captured officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek's 109th Division arrived in Zhangjiakou on the 6th, the first group to take the train after surrendering. They arrived four days earlier than Chiang Kai-shek's planned arrival in Zhangjiakou on October 10th, but they had already laid down their weapons. As the long line snaked through the city, the streets were crowded with tens of thousands of citizens. Many of the Chiang's officers and soldiers wore American-style caps. Their khaki uniforms were ragged and thin. Many people, unable to bear the early autumn cold in the border region, draped military blankets and cotton quilts over their bodies. An old lady said to the reporter: "Look, they are still wearing single layers. It's really not worth fighting the common people for Chiang Kai-shek!" According to railway workers who arrived in Zhangjiakou on the same train this morning, along the way, the workers directly expressed their anger at the Chiang Kai-shek's army's invasion of the Chahar Liberated Area to these officers and soldiers. Many soldiers cried as a result. They complained: "This is all Chiang Kai-shek's fault!" As the Chiang's officers and soldiers marched, the audience along the way repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Welcome Chiang's officers and soldiers to lay down their weapons and stand on the side of the people!" and "Resolutely refuse to be cannon fodder for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries in the civil war!"

　　蒋军一○九师官兵五百人
    放下武器抵张垣
    【新华社张家口七日电】蒋军一○九师被俘官兵五百余人已于六日清自首批搭车抵张。他们较蒋介石十月十日到张家口的计划还早四天，但他们已放下了武器。当长长行列鱼贯通过市区时，马路两旁已为数万市民所挤满，蒋军官兵多戴美国式便帽，淡黄色的军装褴褛而单薄，许多人因不耐深秋塞上的晓寒，多以军毯棉被披在身上。一个老太太对记者说：“看，现在还穿的单衣。替蒋介石打老百姓真犯不着！”据今晨同车抵张的铁路工人称，沿途工人们曾向这些官兵正面表示对蒋介石军进犯察哈尔解放区的愤恨，不少士兵因此都哭了。他们诉说：“这都是蒋介石的罪孽！”蒋军官兵在行进中，沿途观众不时报以“欢迎蒋军官兵放下武器，站到人民方面来！”“坚决不替蒋介石反动派充当内战炮灰！”等口号。
