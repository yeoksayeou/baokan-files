　　【Report from this newspaper, Wu'an】To thoroughly realize "land to the tiller" and ensure everyone has enough to eat, the Wu'an leadership has formulated several measures for the entire county's reference and implementation: (1) Addressing the livelihood issues of households without labor. The best approach is to organize mutual-aid-type elderly care cooperatives. If this is not immediately feasible, allocate four to five times the share received by the general public during the distribution of the fruits of struggle. (2) Provide substantial assistance in settling down retired soldiers, impoverished people from other villages, and families of cadres. Resolutely send back struggle targets who have fled from other areas, allowing the local masses to struggle against and cleanse them. If they are speculators, advise them to return or remain, depending on the specific circumstances and local conditions. (3) In principle, address the needs of impoverished villages and households on a village-by-village basis. Approve affluent villages voluntarily helping impoverished villages (such as the Northern and Southern Big Cooperatives helping the Wuhe Township). When providing government loans, prioritize impoverished villages and households. (4) Some people are unwilling to accept housing and land, indicating that the land problem has not been genuinely resolved. It is necessary to investigate the reasons behind this strange phenomenon and provide appropriate solutions. (Shi Hong)

　　保证翻身生活向上  武安订出四项办法
    【本报武安讯】为彻底实现耕者有其田，使大家都有饭吃，武安领导机关特订出几种办法，建议全县参考实行：（一）解决没劳力户的生活问题，最好组织同会型的养老合作社。如一时不易作到，可在分配斗争果实时，分得一般群众所得之四至五倍。（二）对荣退军人，外村贫民，干部家属，应很好的帮助安家；对由他地逃来的斗争对象，应坚决送回去，由当地群众斗争清理。若系投机分子，应依其具体情况和当地条件，劝其返回或留居。（三）贫苦村与贫苦户，原则上以村为单位解决，富村自愿帮助贫村（如果南北大社帮助五和乡）者应予批准，政府贷款时应着重贫村贫户。（四）有些人不愿要房地，是土地问题未得真正解决之故，必须研究这种怪现象的原因，予以适当解决。（史洪）
