　　【This Dispatch from the Jilu Yu Border Region on the 15th】 Yangzhuang Village in Qingfeng County, through mass mobilization, has resolved the issue of labor-for-rent and devised a reasonable labor-for-rent method for the future. Military families and militia members are divided into groups, with village cadres also assigned to each group to lead the labor-for-rent effort. Livestock is uniformly managed by the labor-for-rent team leader. The village has a total of twenty-four military families, divided into six groups, each specifically cared for by two cadres. Based on the amount of land owned by each group of military families, it is assigned to the six groups formed by the militia to be responsible for. A labor-for-rent review meeting is held every ten days to report on the labor-for-rent situation of each group, commend model examples, and engage in mutual competition. This approach has greatly satisfied the masses, who say: "In the past, the team leader would wear himself out running around, but he still couldn't take good care of the military families. Now, with the division of labor, each group takes care of its own, the team leader doesn't have to run around, and the work for the military families is done well."

　　杨庄村实行代耕竞赛军属生活已无愁无忧
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】清丰杨庄村在群众运动中解决了代耕问题，研究出今后合理的代耕办法。即将军属与自卫队员分成组，村干部也分到各组去领导代耕，牲口则由代耕队长统一掌握。该村共有军属二十四户，共分为六个组，每组均由两个干部专门照顾，按每组军属的土地数，分由自卫队分成的六个组负责。每十天开一次代耕检讨会，汇报各组代耕情形，表扬模范，互相竞赛。这种作法，使群众很满意地说：“过去代为团长把腿都跑细了，但也没有把军属照顾好了。现在一分工，各组照顾各组，代队团长不用跑腿，军属的活也做好了。”
