　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 28th: New York Dispatch: American artists and movie stars have actively participated in political activities, striving to realize Roosevelt's legacy. Joan Crawford, Louise Rainer, Charlie Chaplin, Fredric March, and others oppose fascism, while "tough guy" Humphrey Bogart, "ham" Edward G. Robinson, "big eyes" Eddie Cantor, "tragic star" Bette Davis, "romantic young man" Robert Young, "maverick of the silver screen" Charles Laughton, even the Marx Brothers "comedians," and "singer" Ginny Simms also actively participate in the struggle to restore the New Deal. Piano virtuoso Rubinstein, radio commentator Corwin (who recently visited China), playwright John Hersey (author of "A Bell for Adano"), novelist Thomas Mann, and female pianist Hessa Shute have also joined the fight against "atomic bomb diplomacy." They all participated in the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions led by Ickes; For "U.S. troops withdrawing from China," they have cooperated with progressive people's organizations to fight, and have decided to support the democratic progressives in the November election and the general election the following year. The reactionaries feel very headache about the participation of these "popular figures" in the progressive camp. "Time" magazine reflected the reason for their headache, the magazine said: "Their participation in campaign activities will affect a large part of the citizens' votes. Because most men and women, although unwilling to listen to the speeches of politicians, once they hear the propaganda of their favorite movie stars, they will find it difficult not to accept it." When the House of Representatives discussed the military aid to China bill this summer, Representative Bolton opposed it in the Foreign Affairs Committee, and she was a female star in Chicago.

　　美艺术家积极参与政治活动
    支持民主分子竞选
    与进步人民团体协力为恢复新政斗争
    反对美军驻华及原子弹外交
    【新华社延安二十八日电】纽约讯：美艺术家及电影明星均已积极参加政治活动，为实现罗斯福遗志而奋斗。琼克劳复、露易斯兰娜、卓别林、菲立德及马区固均反对法西斯，而“硬派巨星”亨弗莱·鲍茹特，“夹格明星”爱德华·鲁滨逊，“大眼睛”爱迪·康泰，“悲剧艳星”蓓蒂·黛维丝，“风流小生”路勃·扬，“影坛怪杰”却里斯·劳顿，乃至“笑匠”马克思兄弟，“歌星”吉宁摩·露丝·李，也都积极参加恢复新政的斗争。还有钢琴圣手鲁宾斯坦、广播评论家柯温（最近曾到中国）、剧作家约翰·海宾（“阿丹诺之钟”的作者）、小说家托玛士曼、女钢琴家海丝·史谷特，也都参加了“反原子弹外交”的战斗。他和她们都参加了伊克斯所领导的科学艺术就业独立公民委员会；为了“美军退出中国”，曾与进步的人民团体协力奋斗，并已决定在十一月选举和后年大选中支持民主进步分子竞选。对于这些“大众心目中所喜爱的人物”参加进步阵营，反动派感觉非常头痛。“时代”杂志反映了他们头痛的原因，该杂志说：“他们参加竞选活动，将影响到很大一部分公民的选票。因为大多数男女公民尽管不愿听信政治家的演说，可是一旦听到他们所喜爱的电影明星的宣传，他们就很难不接受了。”今年夏天众院讨论军事援华法案时，众议员波尔顿即曾在外委会上予以反对，而她正是芝加哥的女明星。
