Ci County News: A farmers' rally of more than 7,000 people from 35 villages in the ninth district of Ci County was held to commemorate Comrade Wang Du, a martyr. They also publicly tried the traitors and spies He Guangzhi and two others. During the period of Japanese occupation, Comrade Wang Du had shielded anti-Japanese cadres behind enemy lines, conducting underground activities with alertness and bravery, repeatedly performing meritorious deeds and winning the support of the masses. The traitors and spies He Guangzhi, Zhao Zhidao, and Wen Yuan regarded Comrade Wang as a thorn in their side and reported him to the enemy, resulting in his capture. Comrade Wang Du always adhered to the national stance, endured all kinds of torture, remained silent, and encouraged and organized more than ten underground workers in the same prison to dig a tunnel and escape from the tiger's den in the middle of the night. After liberation, he more actively led the masses in his village to stand up. He and other traitors then resorted to murder, killing him with stones. When the masses heard this, they were filled with grief and indignation. A rally was held at Jiulongkou a few days ago to commemorate and publicly try He and the other two traitors. At the meeting, countless victims rushed to make accusations. The old mother of the murdered Wang Deyuan cried and cursed, "What grievances did my child have with you, He Guangzhi? You killed him and didn't even let me see his body? He was my only child! Today, I'm not afraid of you anymore. Today is my time to complain." After complaining, she took off her small shoes and beat He. The masses successively accused He, Zhao and other traitors of colluding with the enemy to kill Zhang Zepu, an anti-Japanese cadre behind enemy lines, and of the bloody crimes against the Guo Wenming family of three and other people. They demanded payment for the blood debts of the dozens of lives taken by their bloody hands. The slogan "Eliminate traitors and spies to avenge the dead martyrs!" resounded through the clouds. The government immediately, in accordance with public opinion, executed the three traitors at the cemetery where Comrade Wang Du was buried.
