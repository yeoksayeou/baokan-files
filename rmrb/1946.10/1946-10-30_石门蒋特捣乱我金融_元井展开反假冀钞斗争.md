　　Shi Jiamen Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents Disrupt Our Finance
    Yuanjing Launches a Struggle Against Fake Hebei Currency
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organs have recently been massively counterfeiting Hebei currency and using it in our border areas to sabotage the financial system of the liberated areas. In the Yuan, Jingxing, and Shijiazhuang areas alone, the amount of fake Hebei currency seized by us exceeds ten million yuan. The Kuomintang-occupied Yuan Station openly exchanges one yuan of legal tender for one yuan of fake Hebei currency, or ten yuan of fake Hebei currency for one yuan of genuine Hebei currency, disrupting the market and undermining the financial system. They also use secret agents or unscrupulous merchants to promote the fake Hebei currency in our areas. At the Beisai market in Jingxing earlier this month, our Public Security Bureau found 100,000 yuan of fake Hebei currency on a suspicious person. It was said that this "Hebei currency" was trafficked from Shijiazhuang by Du Sanchang. The Public Security Bureau immediately captured Du Sanchang himself and seized more than 100,000 yuan of fake Hebei currency. Now, Yuan, Jingxing, and other counties have launched an anti-fake Hebei currency movement. In addition to providing appropriate rewards for seizing counterfeit currency, the Yuan County government has also called on all political and civilian agencies in the county to pay close attention to the struggle against counterfeit Hebei currency.

　　石门蒋特捣乱我金融
    元井展开反假冀钞斗争
    【本报长治讯】蒋特机关，近大量伪造冀钞，向我边沿地带行使，破坏解放区金融。仅元氏、井陉、石家庄一带，被我查获之假冀钞为数即在千万元以上。蒋占区元氏车站更公开以法币一元兑换假冀钞一元，或以假冀钞十元换真冀钞一元，捣乱市面，破坏金融，并通过特务或奸商，将假冀钞向我区推行。本月初，井陉北塞集上，我公安局在一行迹可疑人身上搜出假冀钞十万元。据称：该项“冀钞”是杜三昌自石家庄贩来。公安局旋即捕获杜三昌本人，搜出假冀钞十余万元。现元氏、井陉等县都掀起反假冀钞运动。元氏县府除规定查获假钞给以适当奖励之外，并向全县各政民机关提出严密注意反假冀钞斗争。
