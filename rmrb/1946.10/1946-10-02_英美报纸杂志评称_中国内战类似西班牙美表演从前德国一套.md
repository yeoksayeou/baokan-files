Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: A London dispatch reports that the "New Statesman" magazine commented on the Chinese Civil War in late August, stating: "The situation in China is too much like Spain. American ambitious individuals are performing the same act that former German planes performed in Spain, launching a full-scale war against the Communists regardless of potential international disputes. Honest individuals among the Kuomintang leaders may be able to organize a good government, but so far, there are too few of these people and they are too unorganized to defeat those old party members who believe they can rely on American economic and military support." The "Economist" weekly also commented: "If the Chinese Civil War does not stop, it is bound to drag on for a long time, and the economic situation may become even more tragic. And foreign countries involved in this dispute will have to take even greater risks."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: According to a United Press report from New York on the 13th, Dean, former China correspondent for the American Christian Science Monitor, wrote in "The Nation" weekly that the Chinese Civil War is actually a counter-revolutionary action because reactionary forces are preventing a genuine reconciliation with the Communists. Dean further stated that the reactionaries have disregarded seeking reconciliation with Chinese liberals, thus making it possible to eliminate the political monopoly of the reactionaries. Dean pointed out that the reactionaries are using two offensive weapons against the solid alliance of the Communists and liberals: first, using policies of terror and oppression in their controlled areas to eliminate all opposition parties; second, using force in major areas to encircle, blockade, and destroy the power of the Communists. The reactionaries firmly believe that the United States will never allow the Communists to defeat the government because the cornerstone of American policy is to be determined to oppose communism.

　　英美报纸杂志评称
    中国内战类似西班牙美表演从前德国一套
    【新华社延安二十九日电】伦敦航讯：《新政治家》杂志于八月下旬评论中国内战时称：“中国的情形太像西班牙了，美国野心家正表演着前德国飞机在西班牙表演的一套，不顾国际上可能引起的纠纷而对共产党发动全面战争。国民党领袖中的诚实人士，或许能组织良好的政府，但是直到现在为止，这一类人太少、太没有组织足以击败那些以为可以稳靠美国经济和军事支援的老党徒。”《经济学家》周刊亦评论称：“如果中国内战不停，势必拖得很久，经济情况或将变得更悲惨。而卷入这一场纠纷的外国亦得冒更大的危险。”
    【新华社延安二十九日电】据合众社纽约十三日电：美国基督教箴言报前驻华记者狄恩，在《民族》周刊上著文称：中国内战实为一反革命行动，因反动势力在阻止与共产党觅取真正协调。狄恩又称：反动派对与中国自由派觅取协调已置诸不顾，因此足以消灭反动派之政治独占。狄恩指出：反动派使用两项进攻武器对付共产党及自由派之牢固联合，第一种武器为在其统治区内使用恐怖与压迫政策，消灭一切反对党，第二在各主要地区内用武力来包围封锁与毁灭共产党的力量。反动派深信美国决不允共产党有击败政府之事发生，缘美国政策之基石乃决意反共者。
