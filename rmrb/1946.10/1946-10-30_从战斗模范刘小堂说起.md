　　Starting from the Battle Model Liu Xiaotang
    Liberation Daily
    Liu Xiaotang was a heroic and enemy-killing model soldier in the Suzhong Self-Defense War. In one battle, he single-handedly defeated more than ten times the number of enemies, captured a cannon, and won over twelve Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to defect. This is truly a remarkable achievement! What is especially commendable is that he was a soldier in Chiang Kai-shek's army not long ago. He joined the New Fourth Army after being liberated in the Taixing Campaign.
    The same Liu Xiaotang, when he joined Chiang Kai-shek's army and was forced to attack the people, even with American-equipped equipment and more than enough ammunition, the unjust nature of the war could not help but make them lack fighting spirit and become decadent and defeated. Their only way out was to lay down their weapons or drag their guns over. However, when participating in the people's just self-defense war as a member of the people's army, Liu Xiaotang was able to be as brave as a tiger, kill the enemy and win, and become a new hero worshiped by the people. This alone is enough to explain the root cause of Chiang Kai-shek's army's inevitable defeat.
    There are still thousands upon thousands of Liu Xiaotangs in the invading Chiang Kai-shek army, who "are determined not to sell their lives for Chiang Kai-shek." Therefore, we must widely carry out the work of winning them over on the battlefield. After they come over, we should better help and encourage them, so that the guns of all patriotic men are aimed at the enemies of the Chinese nation, in order to accelerate the victory of the self-defense war.

　　从战斗模范刘小堂说起
    解放日报
    刘小堂是苏中自卫战争中一个英勇杀敌的模范战士，在一次战斗中，他独自击溃了十倍以上的敌人，缴大炮一门，争取了十二名蒋军投诚，这真是了不起的战绩！尤其值得赞扬的，因他不久以前还是一个蒋军的士兵，他是在泰兴战役中被解放后才参加新四军的。
    同一个刘小堂，当他参加蒋军，被迫进攻人民的时候，即使有美械装备和较充足的弹药，可是战争的非正义性不能不使他们人无斗志，颓靡败丧。他们唯一的出路，就是放下武器或是拖枪过来。可是，当作为人民军队的一员参加人民正义的自卫战时，刘小堂就能勇猛如虎，杀敌致胜，成为人民崇拜的新英雄。即此一端，已经足够说明蒋军必败的根源。
    现在进犯蒋军中还有成千成万个刘小堂，他们是“决不愿替蒋介石卖命”的，因此我们必须在战场上广泛展开争取他们的工作。已过来之后，应该更好的帮助和鼓励他们，让所有爱国男儿的枪口都对准着中华民族的敌人，以加速自卫战争的胜利。
