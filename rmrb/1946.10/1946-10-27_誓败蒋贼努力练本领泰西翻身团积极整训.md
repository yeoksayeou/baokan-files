[This dispatch comes from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 24th] The Tai Xi Turned-Over People's Regiment is currently undergoing intensive training. All new soldiers in the regiment are channeling their anger towards Chiang Kai-shek into diligently practicing weapon usage and becoming familiar with tactics. This reporter personally visited the regiment's location and the first thing I observed was that every company was filled with a new, vigorous, and eager fighting spirit. Every company's location, whether it was on the street, in the alley, in the courtyard, or on the parade ground, was swept clean. Every new soldier began practicing martial arts before dawn and continued to practice in small groups of three or five until dark. Their political understanding is very clear. If you ask them, "What did you come to do?" even the youngest new soldiers will answer without hesitation, "To fight Old Chiang!" Others said, "If Old Chiang attacks, we poor people will have no way to live. If we want to turn ourselves over, we have to fight him!" They all recognized that Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor. Wang Zhanjiang, a model new soldier from the Seventh Squad of the Tenth Company, said, "Chiang Kai-shek is selling China to the United States and wants to sell our liberated areas too. Can we agree to that? We have to fight him!" As he said this, he rolled up his sleeves, as if he couldn't wait to go to the front line and kill the Chiang bandit. When discussing "Chiang's Army Will Be Defeated" in political class, Wang Zhanyu from the Seventh Squad said, "Chiang's army will be defeated, and our army will win. Take us, for example, we are all volunteers joining the army. We are here to protect our parents and protect the people; Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers are all caught and tied up. Can he fight us? Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek's troops are all harming the people, and the people do not support him. The people in our liberated areas all have land to cultivate and support the Eighth Route Army even more. We will definitely win!" During the training, in addition to learning military skills, politics, and culture, they further demonstrated the excellent qualities of the people's army. Each company and squad, in addition to filling the landlord's water tank, also used their spare time to help the people harvest soybeans, grind flour, and plant wheat. They received sincere love from the local masses. They lived completely in a joyful atmosphere. After class, they would go to the training ground with the veteran soldiers who helped them train, and the veteran soldiers patiently and tirelessly taught them. When this reporter went to visit them, they asked the reporter to write letters home for them. In addition to describing personal situations, every letter had the sentence "I will go home after defeating Old Chiang." They asked me to make it clear to their families: "We will fight Old Chiang wherever he goes. Don't worry about us at home." Recently, they collectively wrote letters to their elders and brethren in Tai Xi, expressing their determination. The original text is briefly published as follows:

    Dear Elders, Brothers, and Sisters: For the past seven or eight years, we have been fighting the enemy while eating and sleeping uneasily, hoping to live a peaceful life. Who would have thought that just after we drove away a Japanese devil, an American imperialist came along. After we defeated Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek came along, not allowing our people to turn over. In order to continue to live, we joined the People's Liberation Army, the Eighth Route Army, and we will not go home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek, that grandson of a turtle. The elders and brethren in the county sent us off for more than ten miles, beating gongs and drums and shouting slogans. We will never forget that. As soon as we got to the military region, we automatically put forward four guarantees: "Help the masses turn over, help the masses harvest and cultivate, no one will desert, and we will not go home until we defeat the old thief Chiang Kai-shek." We are now humbly learning a set of skills to fight the enemy from our older brothers under the leadership of our superiors. We must learn our skills well, resolutely implement the four guarantees, and vow to defend Tai Xi and the liberated areas.

　　誓败蒋贼努力练本领泰西翻身团积极整训
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】泰西翻身团，刻正集中整训。全团新战士，把对蒋介石的愤怒，都集中在精练武器使用与熟悉战术上。记者曾亲赴该团驻地，首先看到的是不管那个连队都充满着新生的昂奋的战斗情绪。每一个连队的驻地，不管是街头、巷尾、院里、操场都扫得干干净净的。每一个新战士天不明就开始练武，直到黑夜还不断有三三五五的下小操。他们的政治认识很明确，假如你问他们：“来干什么的？”那怕是年轻的新战士也会毫不迟疑的答复你：“打老蒋！”还有的说：“要是老蒋打过来了，咱穷人就没法活，咱要翻身就要和他干！”他们都认识到蒋介石是卖国贼，十连七班模范新战士王站江说：“蒋介石把咱中国卖给美国，还想卖咱解放区，咱能愿意吗，非拚不可！”说着就挽起袖子，好像恨不得马上到火线去杀蒋贼。上政治课大家讨论“蒋军必败”时，七班王站玉说：“蒋军必败，我军必胜。拿我们来说，都是自动自愿参军的，我们是为保卫自己爹娘，保卫老百姓来的；蒋介石的兵呢，都是抓来、捆来的。他能拚过咱吗？再说蒋介石的队伍都糟害老百姓，老百姓不拥护他，咱解放区老百姓都有地种了，愈发拥护八路军，咱一定打胜仗！”在整训中，他们除学军事、政治、文化外，更发挥着人民军队的优良品质。各连各班对房东，除了满缸打水之外，还利用课余帮助老百姓割豆子、磨面和种麦，他们受到当地群众真诚的爱戴。他们完全生活在愉快的空气里，下课了，他们还和帮助他们训练的老战士上操场，老战士也耐心的不厌烦的指教他们。当记者去访问他们的时候，他们要求记者给他们写家信，信的内容除过叙述个人情况外，都有一句是“打败老蒋才回家”，他们要我再三给家里写明白：“老蒋走到那儿就要打到那儿。家里千万别结记。”最近他们又全体写信给泰西的父老们表示，他们的决心。兹将原文简略发表如下：
    亲爱的父老兄弟姐妹们：咱们七八年来吃不安，睡不稳的与敌人打仗，就是盼望着过安生日子。谁想刚把一个日本鬼子打走了，又来了个美帝国主义，打垮了个汪精卫，又来了个蒋介石，不让咱们老百姓翻身。我们为了还要活下去，参加了人民子弟兵八路军，不打败蒋介石这个龟孙子不回家。县里的父老兄弟们打着锣鼓，喊着口号送了十几里，我们永不能忘记，到军区便自动提出四大保证：“帮助群众翻身、帮助群众收割耕种、一个也不开小差、打不退蒋介石老贼不回家。”我们现在正虚心的在上级领导下，向我们的老大哥们学习一套打敌人的本领。我们一定要把本事学好，坚决执行四大保证，誓死保卫泰西，保卫解放区。
