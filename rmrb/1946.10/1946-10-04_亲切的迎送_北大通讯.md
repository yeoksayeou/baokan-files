　　A group of thirty students from Chaoyang University, on their way from Chongqing to Beiping to re-establish their school, passed through Xingtai on the 14th of last month after a journey of more than twenty days, and were warmly welcomed by teachers and students of Peking University.
　　That evening, in addition to the school providing food and lodging, many students were assigned to be responsible for the reception.
　　The next morning, Chaoda students, accompanied by Peking University students, visited various places in Xingtai City. In the afternoon at two o'clock, a friendly basketball game was held. The Peking University Sea Swallow team won with a score of 46 to 18. Immediately following, a get-together began in front of the college's main building. The inside and outside of the courtyard were covered with slogans, one of which read: "Brothers and sisters of all universities across the country, let's join hands closely in the patriotic and democratic movement!"
　　Amidst enthusiastic and sustained applause, Chaoda students entered the venue in an orderly manner. In addition to the teachers and students of Peking University, Mr. Huang Mei, Mr. Hei Ding, and Mr. Zeng Ke from the Border Region Literary Association also attended.
　　Secretary-General Luo delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a speech from Principal Fan, who briefly said: "Beiping has always been the source of student movements. With the arrival of Chaoda students, the youth power in Beiping will be further increased. I hope that after the 'May Fourth' and 'December Ninth' movements, Beiping can launch another great movement to fight for independence, democracy, peace, and against traitorous civil war." Subsequently, Chaoda students spoke one after another, their words quite mournful and indignant. Peking University student representatives also delivered welcoming speeches. Finally, the College of Arts and Education performed a Yangko dance to add to the fun. The get-together ended in a warm and harmonious atmosphere between the hosts and guests.
　　On the morning of the 16th, Chaoda students once again boarded their journey amidst cordial farewells.

　　亲切的迎送
    北大通讯
    朝阳大学同学一行三十人，因复校自重庆前往北平，历二十余日行程，于上月十四日路过邢台，备受北大师生热烈欢迎。
    当晚除由校方准备食宿外，并派同学多人，负责招待。
    第二日上午，朝大同学由北大同学作陪前往邢市各处参观，下午两点，举行友谊篮球赛，北大海燕队以四十六比十八胜，紧接联欢会开始，会场在学院的大楼前，院内外满贴标语，其中有一条：“全国各大学兄弟姐妹同学，在爱国民主运动中亲密的携起手来！”
    在热烈经久的掌声中，朝大同学鱼贯入座，到会者除北大师生外，边区文联荒煤，黑丁，曾克诸先生亦亲临参加。
    首由罗秘书长致欢迎词，继由范校长致词，略谓：“北平向来是学生运动的策源地，朝大同学去了，北平青年力量将更加增大，我希望继‘五四’、‘一二九’之后，北平能再发动一个争取独立民主和平与反对卖国内战的大运动”。随后，朝大同学相继发言，言辞颇为沉痛、愤慨，北大同学代表亦致欢迎之词，最后由文教学院出演秧歌助兴，联欢会在宾主热烈融洽的空气中结束。
    十六日清晨，朝大同学又在亲切的送别声中，登上了旅程。
