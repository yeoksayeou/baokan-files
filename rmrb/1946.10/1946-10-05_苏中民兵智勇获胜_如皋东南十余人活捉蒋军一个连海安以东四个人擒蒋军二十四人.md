Xinhua News Agency, Central Jiangsu, 2nd. The militia in Central Jiangsu won victories through ingenuity and bravery. In mid-August, during the battle east of Haian, twenty-four remnant Chiang's soldiers, with one person disguised as a New Fourth Army scout, attempted to escape. While passing through Shisanli Port, a sesame seed cake shop owner invited him to eat several sesame seed cakes. The person left without paying, and the owner and his son realized that this behavior was unlike that of the New Fourth Army. They immediately picked up their guns and chased after the Chiang's soldier to question him. The Chiang's soldier was nervous and immediately laid down his weapon, confessing that there were more than twenty Chiang's soldiers behind him. The owner and his son immediately invited four militiamen to wait in ambush in the cornfield beside the road. At dusk, twenty-three Chiang's soldiers came from north to south. When the militiamen fired their guns, the Chiang's soldiers did not know how many New Fourth Army soldiers were lying in ambush in the field. Hearing the order to "Surrender your weapons," they all laid down their weapons and surrendered. On July 22nd, a company of Chiang's troops was surrounded by the New Fourth Army and compressed to Chenjia Village near Zhima Tu in southeast Rugao. The task of eliminating the company of Chiang's troops was handed over to the local militia. The company of Chiang's troops defended four厢房 and stubbornly resisted. The local militia leader, Mao Zongbing, carrying only one grenade, walked in front of a dozen short-gun team members and rushed into a nearby thatched house. First, he dug a hole in the west wall of the house and hid inside, then dug a small hole in the east wall. A Chiang's soldier in the village saw him, and Mao Zongbing pretended to be a Chiang's soldier and said: "There are many New Fourth Army soldiers, we can't fight anymore, let's surrender!" He immediately received several Chiang's soldiers' answering voices: "Yes, let's surrender!" A Chiang's platoon leader next to the wall opposed the surrender and ordered the machine gunner to fire at Mao Zongbing. The machine gunner was unwilling to fight again and replied: "Report to the platoon leader, the machine gun is malfunctioning." At this time, Mao Zongbing pulled the pin on the grenade and threw it through the hole. Three Chiang's soldiers fell to the ground. The ambushing short-gun team rushed in together, seized the Chiang's machine gun, pointed it at the Chiang's troops, and the entire company of Chiang's troops laid down three machine guns and other weapons and surrendered.

　　苏中民兵智勇获胜
    如皋东南十余人活捉蒋军一个连海安以东四个人擒蒋军二十四人
    【新华社苏中二日电】苏中民兵以机智和勇敢获胜。八月中旬海安以东战役中，残余蒋军二十四人，以一人乔装新四军为前哨，企图逃跑。途经十三里港，一烧饼店老板招呼他吃了几个烧饼，该人不付钱就走，老板父子看出这种行为不像新四军，即拿起枪将该蒋军追上盘查，蒋军心虚，立即放下武器，并供认后面还有二十多名蒋军，老板父子当即邀集民兵四人，守候于道旁玉米田中。至天黑，果有蒋军二十三人自北南来，民兵枪声一响，蒋军不知田里伏有多少新四军，听到喝令“缴枪”，便全体放下武器，俯首就擒。七月二十二日，蒋军一连被新四军包围压缩至如皋东南帙马涂附近之陈家庄后，即将消灭该连蒋军之任务交与当地民兵；该连蒋军据守着四间厢房，进行顽抗。该地民兵领袖卯宗炳，仅带手榴弹一颗，走在十余短枪队员前面，冲入附近一间草屋，先将屋西墙挖一洞钻入隐藏，然后再在东墙挖一小洞，被村里蒋军窥见，卯宗炳即假装蒋军口吻说：“新四军多啦，不能打了，投降吧！”立即得到几个蒋军应声回答：“是呀，投降吧！”墙旁边一个蒋军排长反对投降，反下令机枪手向卯宗炳发射，机枪手不愿再打，回答说：“报告排长，机枪出了毛病。”此时卯宗炳将榴弹引线一拉，从洞口飞了进去，三个蒋军应声倒地，预伏的短枪队一齐冲入，夺下蒋军机枪，对准着蒋军，全连蒋军便放下机枪三挺及其他武器，全部就擒。
