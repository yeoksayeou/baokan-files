[From Our Newspaper in Handan] The ideological review movement in the Border Government organs has entered a high tide since September 1st. Except for a small number of comrades, the majority of the unit has participated in this movement, conducting an in-depth reflection on their ideology over the past six months and focusing on clarifying the main ideological tendencies. At the beginning, the leadership called for reflection and review starting from the main ideology – "what you think about every day" – clarifying one problem at a time. For example, if individual comrades felt that there were not many changes in their ideology, they would first review the leadership. During the review process, the Academic Committee also continuously assigned documents for study as weapons. Throughout the movement, the leaders took personal responsibility and took action themselves. Chairman Yang Rong and Secretary-General Sun often reported current events and conveyed information to everyone. The directors and secretaries of each department personally led the study group leaders, promoting the in-depth development of the movement. The main problems reflected by comrades in the ideological review over the past month are as follows: (1) Unclear understanding of peace, illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's "promises," blurring the fact that Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the people. Individual comrades did not fully recognize the serious situation of the US-Chiang alliance attacking us, and some comrades blindly underestimated the enemy and ignored our difficulties. (2) Individual comrades developed or harbored thoughts of personal fame, status, and personal heroism, were unwilling to work in the Border Government, envied the promotion of comrades below, which led to unease in their work and emotional outbursts. (3) Demands for enjoyment, believing that after entering the city, clothing, food, and housing should be "better" than in the mountains, forgetting our glorious tradition of serving the people arduously. Family problems and marriage problems also more or less affected work. Through discussions, reflections, and individual conversations, it was clarified that (1) the United States has a one-sided policy – assisting Chiang in opposing communism, attempting to turn China into a colony, and Chiang Kai-shek is determined to take the dead-end road of "eliminating the liberated areas" and fighting the civil war to the end. It is wrong to have any illusions about the US and Chiang. (2) The emergence of individualistic thoughts such as fame, status, demands for enjoyment, and family problems is mainly due to the pernicious influence of thoughts of peace, ignoring the current fierce and tense struggle. We should enhance our morale, intensify our work, and not be paralyzed or slack. Chiang Kai-shek's army is attacking the liberated areas, and the soldiers on the front lines are shedding blood and sacrificing their lives. If we in the rear cannot work hard and support the front lines, we will lose our duty to serve the people. After this ideological review, everyone's work enthusiasm increased sharply, and their morale was strengthened. The units of the Secretariat have formulated work and business study plans. The Confidential Section decided to practice writing articles and communications to improve their cultural level. The entire organization is more enthusiastic about production. All the evening meals are attended by all to participate in the autumn harvest. In addition to the continuing harvest of cotton, grains, tobacco, beans, and other crops have been harvested, and autumn vegetables are being irrigated intensively. A tense and pleasant atmosphere has emerged in the work, production, and life of the organization. (Xiushan)

　　杨戎正副主席亲自领导
    边府干部检查思想
    认清蒋美阴谋根绝和平幻想
    提高斗志加紧工作大力支援自卫前线
    【本报邯郸讯】边府机关的思想检查运动，自九月一日起，进入高潮。全单位除少数同志外，大部都参加了这一运动，把半年来的思想作了深入的反省，抓紧主要思想倾向进行清算。领导上开始就号召从主要的思想——“天天在想”的思想反省检查起，明确了一个问题是一个问题，如个别同志认为自己思想上没多少变化时，就先检查领导。检查过程中，学委会又不断指定文件学习，作为武器，在整个运动中首长负责亲自动手，杨戎主席、孙秘书长给大家经常报告时事，传达情况，各厅处秘书主任更亲自领导，担任学习组长，推动了运动的深入发展。一月来的思想检查，综合同志们的反省主要有下列问题：（一）对和平认识的不清楚，对蒋介石的“诺言”有幻想，模糊了蒋介石是人民公敌，个别同志对美蒋联合向我进攻的严重情况认识不足，更有同志盲目轻视敌人，忽视我们的困难。（二）个别同志发展或存在着个人名誉地位思想和个人英雄主义，不愿意在边府工作，看见下边同志提拔，心里羡慕，以致对工作不安心，闹情绪。（三）享乐要求，认为进了城，穿衣、吃饭、住房子都应该比山上“好一点”，忘记了我们为人民服务的艰苦光荣传统。还有家庭问题，婚姻问题，都或多或少影响了工作。经过讨论、反省和个别交谈，明确了（一）美国是一面政策——助蒋反共，企图变中国为殖民地，蒋介石决心要走“消灭解放区”，打内战打到底的死路。对美蒋存在任何幻想是不对的。（二）名誉地位、享乐要求、家庭问题等等个人主义思想的产生，主要是和平思想作祟，漠视当前激烈紧张的斗争，应该提高斗志，加紧工作，不麻痹、不松懈。蒋介石大军进攻解放区，前线将士流血牺牲，我们在后方，如不能紧张工作，支援前线，就失去为人民服务的本分。经过这一思想检查，大家工作情绪骤高，斗志加强了，秘书处各单位已订出工作业务学习计划，机要科决定练习写文章写通讯，以提高文化水平。全机关生产情绪更加热烈，每日晚饭会全部参加秋收，除棉花还在继续收摘外，谷、烟、豆等已收割完毕，秋菜正在加紧灌溉，机关工作生产生活已出现了一种紧张愉快的气象。（秀山）
