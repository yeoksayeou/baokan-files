Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Reuters, Paris: The French Communist Party issued a declaration on the 17th, beginning its campaign for the November 10th general election, announcing a demand for the organization of a left-wing coalition government. The declaration stated: "The restoration of France, the consolidation of the Republic, and the establishment of peace are not the work of one party, but should be the result of the joint efforts of a united Republican majority." The declaration opposes a coalition government that includes the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and suggests that the platform of the new coalition government should be based on the principles put forward in the "Left-Wing Delegation Program" drafted a year ago. This program is a joint program of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, the General Confederation of Labor, and the League for Human Rights. The Popular Republican Movement did not participate. The declaration calls for the re-unification of democratic social forces. The declaration was issued after a meeting of the Executive Committee of the French Communist Party.

　　法共发表宣言
    号召组织左翼联合政府
    【新华社延安十八日电】路透社巴黎讯：法国共产党十七日发表宣言，开始其十一月十日大选的竞选运动，宣布要求组织左翼联合政府。该宣言称：“法兰西的复兴共和国的巩固与和平的建立，不是某一党的工作，而应是共和派大多数联合的共同努力的结果。”该宣言反对包括人民共和运动党在内的联合政府，并建议新的联合政府的政纲应为一年前拟成的“左翼代表团纲领”中所提出的原则，这一纲领是共产党社会党急进党劳工总同盟及人权联盟的联合纲领，人民共和运动党并没有参加该宣言，号召民主社会力量重新团结起来。该宣言是法共举行执委会会议之后发表的。
