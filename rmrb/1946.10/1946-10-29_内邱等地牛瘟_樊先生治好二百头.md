　　Cattle Plague in Neiqiu and Other Places
    Mr. Fan Cures 200 Head
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Cattle plague has been discovered in Neiqiu, Zanhuang, Xingtai, Pingshun, Linxian and other places, and its prevalence is quite serious. In Doukou and Dongzhuang villages in the Third District of Pingshun, 66 heads of cattle fell ill within five days. In Neiqiu, cattle plague has also spread throughout the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts, greatly affecting the autumn harvest and planting. The respective counties are now holding emergency meetings of veterinarians to study treatment methods. According to Zanhuang reports, cattle suffering from the plague have dry nasal cavities, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and refuse to eat grass. In severe cases, their legs are lame and their backs are arched, and they lie down unable to get up. Mr. Fan Jizhang of Xianren Village in Neiqiu believes that the cause of the cattle plague is that the weather was dry in July, and the cattle suffered from heat toxicity. Excessive labor during autumn plowing and wheat planting, coupled with imbalanced feeding, led to the onset of the disease. Two-thirds of the symptoms are lung qi disorders, and one-third are dry omasum disease. He treated them with Sanleng @ @ powder and cured more than 230 heads in 14 days. In addition, farmers have used local methods to treat the cattle with noticeable results: for cattle with dry nasal cavities, abdominal distension, and refusal to eat grass, one pound of raw vinegar can be poured down the throat, and the animal will recover in one day. If the cattle's legs are cold, four taels of sesame oil can be added after the vinegar. Second, for those with abdominal pain and arched backs, kill a chicken and first pour the chicken blood down the throat, then mash the five internal organs together with the feces and pour them down the throat, which is called raw chicken powder. If it is still ineffective, half a catty of Toona sinensis seeds can be ground and added to water and poured down the throat for recovery.

　　内邱等地牛瘟
    樊先生治好二百头
    【本报长治讯】内邱、赞皇、邢台、平顺、林县等地发现牛瘟，流行颇严重。平顺三区豆口、东庄二村，五天内病倒六十六头。内邱牛瘟亦遍及二、三、四区。大大影响了秋收秋种。各该县现正召开兽医紧急会议，研究救治办法。据赞皇报导：受瘟之牛，鼻腔干燥，肚胀、肚疼不吃草，重者腿拐腰弓，躺卧不起，内邱仙人村樊继章先生认为牛瘟发生的原因是七月天旱，牛多中热毒。秋耕种麦中劳动过度，喂养失调，遂致病发。这病症三分之二是肺气疯，三分之一是百页干病，他以三楞＠＠散医治，十四日内治好二百三十多头。此外，农民以土法医治已见效者，计有：牛鼻干燥肚胀不吃草者，以生醋一斤灌上一日即愈，若牛腿发凉，可于灌醋后加灌香油四两。二、肚疼弓腰者杀鸡一只，先将鸡血灌上，再将五脏连粪捣烂灌上，谓之生鸡散，如仍无效，可以椿树籽半斤碾烂加水灌上即愈。
