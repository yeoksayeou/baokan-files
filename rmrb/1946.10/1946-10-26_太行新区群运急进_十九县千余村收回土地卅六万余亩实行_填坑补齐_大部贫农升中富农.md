[Dispatch from Changzhi, October 24th, this newspaper] Since August, local cadres from all over the Taihang region, together with more than 1,800 comrades from the emancipation teams, under the resolute guideline of implementing the Political Consultative Conference's resolution of "land to the tillers," have successively launched a thorough liquidation and emancipation movement in various counties of the New District. In the past two months, the leadership has truly let go, followed the mass line, and launched a rapid, widespread, and intense liquidation of accounts of rent, interest, and the shifting of burdens, usurpation, and other exploitations of blood and sweat, making the movement popular in more than 4,000 administrative villages in all 37 counties and cities of the New District. The flames of emancipation illuminated the clear skies of Taihang. Approximately two million people were involved in the movement, accounting for more than 70 percent of the New District's population, an increase of one-fifth compared to before July. According to statistics from 26 villages in Xiangyuan, more than 5,000 peasant households were involved in the struggle, accounting for 90 percent of the total number of households, an increase of 32 percent compared to before July. The emancipation camp was not chaotic, and the targets of struggle were clear. In the third district of Xiangyuan, many middle peasants were struggled against before July. This time, among the 403 targets of struggle, there was only one middle peasant household (because they were unrepentant pseudo-cadres). According to incomplete statistics from 1,216 villages in two-thirds of the nineteen counties and cities of Zanhuang, Lincheng, Xingtai, Shahe, Xingtai City, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, Heshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Wu'an, Anyang, Tangyin, Lingchuan, Bo'ai, Wenxian, Xiuwu, and WuZhi, a total of more than 368,500 mu of land and 110,000 rooms and over 9,000 head of livestock were recovered. Under the unified policy of "filling the pits and making up the difference," after democratic discussion, the fruits were distributed fairly and reasonably, and the vast majority of poor peasants rose to become middle or rich peasants. In 1,427 administrative villages in twenty counties including Wu'an, Anyang, Heshun, Zuoquan, Shahe, Xingtai, and Lingchuan, the principle of "land to the tillers" has been initially realized, accounting for 45.7 percent of the areas where the movement was launched (in Wu'an, Anyang, and Zuoquan, the principle has been initially realized in 90 percent of the villages). The countryside after emancipation presents an unprecedented and joyful new picture of happiness. However, according to recent investigations, out of approximately nine million mu of land in the New District, approximately 3.6 million mu were occupied by feudal landlords, and the peasants have only recovered a small portion, with the vast majority of the land still being occupied and exploited by feudal landlords. In order to eliminate this exploitation, various places are actively arranging for an in-depth movement this winter. Furthermore, emancipated peasants are enthusiastically joining the army and participating in the war to defend their fruits and strive for the victory of the comprehensive resistance in the patriotic self-defense war.

　　太行新区群运急进
    十九县千余村收回土地卅六万余亩实行“填坑补齐”大部贫农升中富农
    【本报长治二十四日电】八月以来，太行全区各地地方干部与一千八百余翻身队同志，在坚决实现政协决议耕者有其田的方针下，先后在新区各县掀起了彻底清算翻身运动。两月来领导上真正放开了手，走了群众路线，发动了迅速、普遍、猛烈的清算租、息与转嫁负担、霸占等血汗账，使运动普及了所有新区三十七个县市的四千余行政村，翻身烈火，照彻了太行晴天。卷入运动的群众约二百余万，占新区人口百分之七十以上，较七月前扩大五分之一。据襄垣二十六个村子的统计，五千余农户卷入斗争，占总户数百分之九十，较七月前增加百分之三十二。翻身阵营不混乱，斗争对象明确，襄垣三区七月前曾斗了不少中农。此次四百零三个斗争对象中，仅有一户中农（因是不改错的伪干部）。据赞皇、临城、邢台、沙河、邢市、寿阳、榆次、太谷、和顺、左权、襄垣、武安、安阳、汤阴、陵川、博爱、温县、修武、武陟等十九个县市三分之二的一千二百十六个村不完全统计，共收回土地三十六万八千五百余亩，房子十一万间，牲口九千余头。在统一“填坑补齐”的方针下，经过民主讨论，公道合理的分配了果实，贫农大部上升为中农或富农。武安、安阳、和顺、左权、沙河、邢台、陵川等二十个县的一千四百二十七个行政村，已初步实现了耕者有其田，占发动地区的百分之四十五点七（武安、安阳、左权百分之九十的村子均已初步实现）。翻身后的农村，呈现从来未有的一幅愉快幸福的新图景。但据最近调查，新区约九百万亩土地中，被封建地主霸占者约三百六十万亩，农民现收回者仅为小部，尚有绝大部分土地在封建地主霸占剥削中，为解除这些剥削，各地正纷纷布置今冬深入运动。又：翻身农民为保卫自己果实正在热烈的参军参战，争取爱国自卫战争全面抵抗的胜利。
