[Our Newspaper Xingtai News] On the morning of the 13th of this month, more than 110 representatives from cultural and educational circles in Xingtai City, including Northern University, the Border Region Literary Association, and various groups, gathered in the auditorium of Xingtai Normal School to hold a symposium on "American Troops Withdraw from China," responding to the "Movement to Demand American Troops Withdraw from China" initiated by various circles in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Hong Kong. Among those present were Principal Fan Wenlan of Northern University, Secretary-General Luo Qing, Dean Zhang Baiyuan, and Professors Zhang Zonglin, Chen Weishi, Yin Da, and Li Yan; writers, poets, and drama and art workers from the Border Region Literary Association such as Huangmei, Heiding, and Lu Li; representatives from various printing and publishing institutions in Xingtai City; principals from various middle schools and normal schools, as well as teacher and student representatives from various colleges of Peking University, various middle schools, and elementary schools; Chang Huazhi, the mayor of Xingtai City, also attended and participated.

After Chairman Luo Qing clearly and concisely presented the central issues for the symposium, Zhang Mugang, a young man who had recently arrived at the Literature and Art Research Office of Northern University from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, stood up excitedly and said: "Today, the areas occupied by Chiang are actually completely the world of American soldiers, American markets, and secret agents... I shouldn't say that I came from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, but rather that I arrived in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Because today, only the Liberated Areas are the true rear areas of all of China."

The poet Lu Li, standing tall with anger, said: "Tell the people of the whole country that there is no reason for American troops to be stationed in China. Tell Truman, Byrnes, and those reactionaries that the Chinese people are unwilling to be slaves. We have a hundred years of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal experience, the Eighth Route Army, this people's armed force, and the free and democratic rear area—the Liberated Areas. We will not be polite to the invaders!"

Principal Fan Wenlan, who attended despite being ill, spoke amidst thunderous applause. He said: "There are no wolves in the world that don't eat sheep, or weasels that don't eat chickens. This is their nature. Imperialism wanting colonies and wolves definitely eating sheep are the same principle. American imperialism just happened to run into Chiang Kai-shek, this running dog, but this dog is completely a deflated ball, with no capital at all." After he thoroughly analyzed the essence of Chiang Kai-shek, the tricks of American imperialism, and the strength of the people, he encouraged everyone to raise their confidence in victory, saying: "If we continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle of the past eight years, and follow the leadership of the genius leader Mao Zedong, we will certainly be able to make the American troops withdraw from China and defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek."

Professor Zhang Zonglin, who had just arrived at Peking University from Yan'an, said: "The presence of American troops in China has two major sins: one is to undermine China's peace, and the other is to support China's civil war. Today, we are still politely asking them to withdraw. If the United States does not change its policy, it is our enemy, and we will drive them out." He emphasized: "We have the power to drive them out, just like we drove out Japanese imperialism. This power belongs to the people of the whole country, and it is the power of the people's leader Mao Zedong leading us!" Then, representatives from all walks of life spoke enthusiastically. Ms. Wang Ying, a teacher from the Women's Elementary School, painfully recounted the atrocities of the American troops she had witnessed in Peiping not long ago, especially the facts of women being humiliated, arousing even greater indignation from everyone. Everyone agreed that cultural and educational workers in the Liberated Areas should use their own weapons—pen and mouth—to expand the movement for American troops to withdraw from China to the common people. And unite to do everything possible to support the front lines, and never stop until victory is achieved.

Finally, the entire body passed a telegram to organizations such as the New York Committee for Peace and the Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee in the United States, as well as people's organizations and democratic人士 from all walks of life in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Hong Kong, responding to the "Movement for American Troops to Withdraw from China." And sent a telegram of condolence to the commanders and fighters on the front lines, congratulating them on the news of the victorious patriotic self-defense war! The conference closed at 3:00 p.m. in the drizzling autumn rain. (Gu Gu)

　　响应美军退出中国运动
    邢市文教界集会座谈
    决以自己的笔和嘴向群众扩大宣传
    世界上没有不吃羊的狼
    范文澜校长揭露美反动本质
    张宗麟教授说：
    美如不改变政策我们就赶他出去
    【本报邢台讯】本月十三日上午，邢台市文化教育界北方大学、边区文联及各团体代表共一百一十余人，齐集邢师大礼堂，举行“美军退出中国”座谈会，响应上海、重庆、香港各界发起之“要求美军退出中国运动”。出席者有北方大学范文澜校长，罗青秘书长，张柏园教务长，和张宗麟、陈唯实、尹达、李岩诸教授；边区文联作家、诗人、戏剧美术工作者荒煤、黑丁、鲁藜等；邢台市各印刷出版机关；各中学师范校长以及北大各院、各中学、完小教员学生代表等；邢台市常化志市长亦出席参加。
    主席罗青明确简练的向大家提出座谈问题的中心后，新从大后方到北大文艺研究室学习的青年张木岗激奋的站起来说：“今日蒋占区实际已完全是美国兵，美国市场和特务的世界…………我不应该说是从大后方来的，而应该说是到了大后方。因为今天全中国只有解放区才是真正的大后方。”
    诗人鲁藜愤怒的挺着胸说：“告诉全国的人民，美军驻在中国是丝毫没有理由的。告诉杜鲁门、贝纳斯那些反动派，中国人民是不愿做奴隶的。我们有百年的反帝反封建的经验，有八路军这支人民的武装，有自由民主的大后方——解放区，我们不会对侵略者客气的！”
    抱病出席的范文澜校长，在雷动的掌声中讲话了，他说：“世界上没有不吃羊的狼，不吃鸡的黄鼠狼，这是天性。帝国主义要殖民地和狼一定吃羊是一个道理。美国帝国主义恰巧碰上蒋介石这个走狗，不过这只狗完全是一个泄了气的皮球，一点资本也没有”。他详细的分析了蒋介石的本质，美帝国主义的骗术和人民力量以后，又鼓舞大家提高胜利的信心说：“我们继续发扬八年来艰苦奋斗的精神，跟随着天才领袖毛泽东的领导，一定能使美军退出中国去，把卖国贼蒋介石打垮。”
    才从延安到北大的张宗麟教授说：“美军驻在中国有两大罪状：一是破坏中国和平，一是支持中国内战。今天我们还是客气的请他撤出去。美国如果不改变政策，就是我们的敌人，我们就要赶他出去。”他加重语气说：“我们有力量赶他出去，象赶日本帝国主义一样。这力量是全国人民的，是人民领袖毛泽东领导我们的力量！”接着各出席代表都热烈发言，女子完小教员王英女士，深痛叙述不久以前在北平亲目所见到的美军暴行，尤其是妇女被侮辱的事实，引起大家更大的愤慨，大家一致认为，解放区的文教工作者，应该用自己的武器——笔和嘴，把美军退出中国这一运动扩大到老百姓中间去。并团结起来，尽一切力量支援前线，不获胜利誓不终止。
    最后，全体通过向美国纽约争取和平委员会、民主远东政策委员会等团体，及上海、重庆、香港各界人民团体民主人士，发出通电，响应“美军退出中国运动”。并向各前线指战员致慰问电，祝贺爱国自卫战争的捷音！大会在下午三点钟，绵绵秋雨中闭幕。（古古）
