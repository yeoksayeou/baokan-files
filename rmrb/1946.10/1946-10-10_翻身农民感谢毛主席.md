Overturned Peasants Thank Chairman Mao
任冰如　鲁藜

            New Emotions

A new emotion is growing here. When you walk from a village that has not yet been through struggle to a village that has distributed land, you will clearly feel: two villages, like two worlds. The peasants in the village who have obtained land are filled with such a strong sense of awakening and joy.

At dusk, we sat in the peasants' large cart, starting from the north end of Dashan Village to go to the fields. The villagers who were shouting at the animals, those young people, all pointed to the large cotton field, praising:

"This has become our land!"

"This piece alone is more than a qing of land, belonging to the local tyrant landlord Ding Chang!"

"Turning over! Oh! I only now know what turning over means; before, even walking on other people's land, picking a wild vegetable, they would say it was stealing..."

"We didn't even dare to get close to the edge of the land."

            Following Chairman Mao's Path

In the house where we lived, almost every night it was crowded with people. The village activists, cadres, militia, and young people all squeezed in. They demanded progress, they needed collective life, and every night they would talk about work and current events with the comrades of the work team until they gradually went back late at night.

In this village, one-third are Catholics, and most of them have now become activists, doing new "preaching" after turning over.

Wu Jinke, a deputy director of the peasant association, said: "It's not just that I say it's right, the method made by Chairman Mao is really right. Our Chairman Mao led everyone to turn over, and we enter heaven alive. Jesus, on the other hand, advises believers to suffer losses, and they will enter heaven after death. Catholicism is not as good as Chairman Mao's path."

Another, Cui Zhen, a short, dark man with a religious icon around his neck, continued:

"Catholicism has a contradiction: if you don't struggle against the old rich, and they hit you with a stick, you have to let them hit you again. They lend money and suck blood, sucking all our blood, and we shouldn't oppose it, and they even say: those who suffer injustice will live long, those who suffer injustice don't need to say anything, and they can ascend to heaven."

Speaking of this, he pointed to the front yard (where the landlord lived) and said: "Ask him to love others as himself? He can't even enter his door!"

            Suffering Has Ended

In the morning, we went to the village to visit. When we arrived at the door of each peasant's house, they grabbed your hand tightly and wouldn't let go, wanting you to enter their house: "Comrade, don't forget our home, this is our home!"

There are no more sincere words than this. From this simple voice, you will feel a kind of fervent emotion from the peasants' hearts.

In an old temple in the south corner of the village, Grandma Dongbao was living temporarily. She was spinning cotton, and when she saw us, the first thing she said was:

"Suffering has ended, there is an end!" I haven't had land since I was fifteen years old, and I've been living a poor life, all relying on this (spinning cotton) to eat. My second son was sold when he was eight years old. He was so hungry that he couldn't beg for food, and he exchanged the money from selling him for a steamed bun."

Saying this, she sobbed and shed tears: "The child came back from the field and said: 'Mother, I pick up manure, but I can't see it.' He was starving. My eldest child is forty-six years old, and he went out last year because he couldn't do anything. I also sold four daughters..."

"Ah! If the Eighth Route Army had come two or three years earlier, his father wouldn't have left, and I wouldn't have sold my daughters." In the past, there were no quilts or covers. Now people say: "Grandma, don't spin for others anymore, make something to wear for yourself!"

    The fifteenth of August is Mid-Autumn Festival
    Poor people have raised their heads
Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival in this village was an unprecedented event in thousands of years. The people themselves held a grand meeting to celebrate the victory of turning over.

The meeting place was set up in a manor of the local tyrant landlord Ding Chang, under the jujube tree. All the overturned peasants and their families in the village were sitting around the table, and on the table were arranged pears, watermelons, pomegranates, peaches, persimmons, peanuts, cigarettes...

The meeting was filled with laughter. The people of Wang'er Village also came to celebrate with stilts and drums.

Poor peasant Cui Zhen said: "Turning over relies on the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. We must know and be grateful. In which dynasty or generation could anyone let us poor people turn over and let poor people have food and clothing? We know that in the past there was a dynasty where the fifteenth of August was for killing Tartars. The people were united in killing Tartars. Who are we killing today? We must oppose traitors and local tyrants to the end."

Catholic Mr. Zhao Lin said: "We are very happy in our hearts, we have turned over. When drinking water, we must think of the source. Chairman Mao led us to turn over. We must tell our children and grandchildren and pass it on without forgetting. Every year on the fifteenth of August, we will hold a commemorative week to let our children and grandchildren always remember: our land and cotton were given to us by Chairman Mao."

Militia Captain Sun Wenqi suddenly stood up and saluted everyone, and everyone laughed. He only said briefly:

"Today is the time to show our unity and joy. We must take out the words from our hearts and lungs."

Middle peasant Wu Xianzhang said: "Since the Japanese oppression, who can still be happy. Today we have turned over, some have gotten land, some have gotten estates. I didn't get land, I got more than 20,000 yuan, and I should congratulate everyone and celebrate Chairman Mao's strong leadership in work."

You said a word, I said a word, and everyone who participated in the meeting opened their mouths.

Some said: "The bad elements of the Kuomintang won't let us turn over. Chairman Mao came, and I was given twenty mu of land. I am willing to die for this, there is no turning back, and I will follow Chairman Mao."

"Old Jiang is attacking our liberated areas and opposing our turning over; we must follow Chairman Mao to the death, and everyone must unite to oppose Old Jiang's attack."

    The fifteenth of August is Mid-Autumn,
    Poor people have raised their heads;
    Today's happy gathering,
    Turning over brings victory, fortune, and longevity.

At the meeting, Wu Gouqing, who had been a food seeker and had been given land, spontaneously recited this poem. The peasants overthrew feudal rule, obtained land, and became the masters of the land. This is a completely new feeling, and this feeling is also reflected in their songs.

            The Reins Are in Our Hands

One evening, a large cart loaded with golden ears of grain passed by the landlord's manor.

"This livestock is good, whose is it?" a comrade asked them.

"Isn't it from the divided traitors and tyrants!" the peasant replied.

"Pulling it for your family!"

"In the past, we suffered for the old rich for a year, and they all pulled it for the old rich. Now, the reins are in our hands, who else should we pull it for if not us!"

He said, waving his whip, and the large cart jumped on the road, turning away.

Here, I also deeply remember the words of an overturned peasant: "Comrade, get me a portrait of Chairman Mao, I will look at him every day."

                              September 24, 1946.

　　翻身农民感谢毛主席
    任冰如　鲁藜
            新的情感
    一种新的情感，在这里生长着。当你从那尚未经斗争的村子走到那分配过土地的村子，你会很明显的感到：两个村子，就像两个世界。那获得土地的村庄的农民，是洋溢着一种多么强烈的觉悟和欢欣的情绪啊。
    黄昏时候，我们坐在农民的大车上，从大善村北头出发向地里去，那吆牲口的老乡们，那些青年人们，都给我们指着这大块棉花地，赞颂着：
    “这成了咱的地了哟！”
    “就这一片是顷多地，是那恶霸地主丁常的！”
    “翻身！哎哟！我这才知道翻身；从前从人家地里走一走，拾个野菜，都说偷人……”
    “咱们连地边上挨都不敢挨啊。”
            走毛主席的道路
    在我们住的房子里，几乎每晚都拥挤着人，村中的积极分子、干部、民兵、青年们都挤进来，他们要求进步，他们需要集体的生活，每夜要在这里跟工作队的同志们谈工作，谈时事，一直到半夜才陆续回去。
    在这村里，有三分之一是天主教徒，现在大部都成了积极分子。在翻身后作着新的“布道”。
    武金科，一个农会副主任，他说：“不是光我说对，毛主席作的法子是真对，咱们毛主席领导着大家翻了身，活着就进天堂；耶稣呢，劝教徒说，吃亏好，死了进天堂。天主教比不上毛主席的道路。”
    另一个，黑矮个子，颈项上还带着圣像的崔真接着说：
    “天主教有个矛盾：老财不斗争，人家打一棍子，还给人家再打，人家放账，吸血，把咱血都吸走，不应当反对，还说：受屈人长在，受屈人不用吭，能升天堂。”
    说到这里，他用手指着前院（那里住着地主）说：“叫他爱人如己？他的门也不能进呢！”
            受苦到头了
    早晨，我们到村子里去访问。到了每家农民的门上，他们就紧拉着你的手不放，要进他的家去：“同志，不要忘了咱的家，这是咱的家！”
    没有再比这更诚恳的话了，从这简朴的声音里，你会感到一种发自农民内心的热烈情感。
    在村南角上一座老爷庙里，东宝奶奶借住在这里，她正在纺花，见了我们，头一句就说：
    “受到头了，有了头了！”我十五岁起就没地，过穷苦日，都指这（纺花）吃。我那二小子，八岁就卖了，卖了十八年，饿得没法，要饭要不来，卖了他的钱换了一个馒头。”
    说着，她呜咽掉泪：“孩子从地里回来说：‘娘啊，我拾粪，光看不着。’他饿慌了。俺大孩四十六啦，前年更没法也出门去了，我又卖了四个闺女……”
    “啊！八路军早来二三年，他爹也不会走，我也不会卖了闺女”。过去没铺的，没盖的，如今人家说：“奶奶，不给人家纺啦，自己做点穿吧！”
    八月十五是中秋
    穷苦百姓抬了头
    过中秋节，在这个村子里是数千年来空前的盛况，人民自己举行庆祝翻身的胜利的大会。
    大会地点就设在恶霸地主丁常的一座庄院里，枣树底下。全村翻身的农民和家属们，都围坐在桌子边上，在桌面上，排着梨子、西瓜、石榴、桃子、柿子、花生、纸烟…………
    会上，充满一片欢笑声，王儿庄的老百姓还踩了高跷来给他们庆贺，锣鼓喧天。
    贫农崔珍说：“翻身靠了共产党八路军，我们要知恩感恩，有那朝那代，那个能叫我们穷人翻身，叫穷人都有饭吃有衣穿。我们知道，从前有个朝代，八月十五杀鞑子，人民一心杀鞑子，我们今天杀谁呢？我们要反奸反恶霸到底。”
    天主教徒赵林老先生说：“我们心里很喜欢，翻起身来了，饮水思源，翻身是毛主席领导咱，要告诉儿女子孙，传之不忘。每年八月十五作一个纪念周，叫子孙永远记住：我们的土地，棉花是毛主席给咱们的。”
    民兵队长孙文祺，猛站起来对大家行礼，大家都笑了。他只短短的说：
    “今天是表现咱们团结，欢乐。我们要把心肝肺的话都掏出来。”
    中农吴献章说：“日本压迫以来，谁还能欢乐。今天翻身了，有得地的，有得庄子的，我没分地，我得二万多元，该向大家庆喜，庆贺毛主席工作领导强。”
    你一言我一语，参加大会的人都开了口。
    有的说：“国民党坏分子不让咱翻身，毛主席来了，我分得二十亩地，我甘心至死，没有回头路，跟毛主席走。”
    “老蒋进攻咱们解放区，反对我们翻身；我们要至死跟毛主席走，大家团结起来，反对老蒋进攻。”
    八月十五是中秋，
    穷苦百姓抬了头；
    今天开的同乐会，
    翻身胜利福禄寿。
    在大会上，当过觅汉，分得土地的武枸卿，即席吟出了这首诗。农民打垮了封建统治，获得了土地，作了土地的主人，这是全然新奇的感觉，这种感觉也反映在他们的歌谣里。
            缰绳握在咱手里
    一天傍晚，一辆大车满载着金黄黄的谷穗，驰过地主的庄院。
    “这牲口不错，那人的？”有同志问他们。
    “还不是分的奸霸的！”那农民回答。
    “给你家拉的！”
    “从前，给老财受了一年苦，都给老财拉去，如今，缰绳握在咱手里，不给咱拉给谁拉！”
    他说着，又挥着鞭子，大车跳动在路上，扯转过去了。
    在这里，我还深深地记住一个翻身农民的话：“同志，给我搞一幅毛主席像，我每天看看他。”
                              一九四六、九、二四。
