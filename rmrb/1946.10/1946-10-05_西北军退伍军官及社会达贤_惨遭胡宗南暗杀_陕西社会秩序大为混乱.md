　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st:  A dispatch from Xi'an reports that in the past month, nearly ten retired Northwest Army officers and social notables have been tragically assassinated by Hu Zongnan. Those shot and killed include Han Zifang, former regimental commander of the 17th Route Army, Li Yaoqing, former regimental commander of the Shaanxi Second Security Regiment, retired military officer Guo Shanqi, Wang Zhangfeng, a respected elder of Weinan, and Shi Wentong, a member of the Qianxian County Council.  Han Zifang was a former subordinate of the 17th Route Army, having served as a regimental commander. After the reorganization of the unit following the War of Resistance Against Japan, he continued to serve as the regimental commander of the 105th Regiment of the 177th Division, bravely fighting in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Later, he was ostracized by the Kuomintang reactionaries and retired to his hometown. This month, plainclothes agents from the Dali Prefectural Commissioner's Office suddenly went to his village to investigate, and soon after, carried out a sniper attack. Wang Zhangfeng was a local notable of Weinan, always enthusiastic about public welfare. He founded the Chishui Vocational School and in recent years led the masses in building water conservancy projects, gaining popular support. In mid-August, several thugs suddenly arrived by car, shot and killed Wang at the vocational school, and sped away. This kind of assassination by the Kuomintang authorities has disrupted social order in Shaanxi.

　　西北军退伍军官及社会达贤
    惨遭胡宗南暗杀
    陕西社会秩序大为混乱
    【新华社延安一日电】西安讯：月余来西北军在乡军官及社会贤达惨遭胡宗南暗杀者几达十人，遭枪杀者计有十七路军老团长韩子芳，前陕保二团团长李遥青，退伍军官郭山琦，渭南耆绅王章峰，乾县参议员史文通等。按韩子芳为十七路军旧部，曾任团长，抗战后该部改编，继任一七七师一○五团团长，曾于中条山英勇抗战，后遭国民党反动派排斥，退休在乡，本月突有大荔专署便衣队往其村舍侦探，不久即实施狙击。王章峰系渭南地方贤达，素来热心社会公益事业，曾手创赤水职业学校，近年又领导群众兴修水利，颇得民心。八月中，突有暴徒数名，乘车自职校将王氏击毙，急驰而去。国民党当局此种暗杀行为，已使陕西社会秩序混乱。
