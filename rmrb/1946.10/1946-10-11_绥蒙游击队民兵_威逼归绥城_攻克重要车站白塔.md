　　Sui-Meng Guerrilla Militia
    Threatens Gui-Sui City
    Captures Important Railway Station Baita
    Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 8th. While Fu Zuoyi's troops were rampaging east of Jining, around Zhangjiakou, a certain Eighth Route Army guerrilla corps suddenly appeared behind Fu's occupied area. With the assistance of local masses and militia, they actively sabotaged the Ping-Sui Railway and struck at Fu's supply lines. On the 30th of last month, the Sui-Meng guerrilla militia captured Baita, an important station on the Ping-Sui Railway (thirty li east of Gui-Sui), threatening Fu's headquarters in Gui-Sui City. On the 29th of last month, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army intercepted and attacked 14 companies of Yan Shu-huai’s local troops northwest of Liangcheng at Ximen, killing and capturing Fu's soldiers and seizing some weapons. In the area of Dongxi Huangheshao Village, fifty li southeast of Gui-Sui, Fu's village public offices and Baojia corps fled in terror upon hearing the news. On the evening of September 6th, the guerrillas attacked Zhao Qingshan's troops of Ma Fuxing's company northeast of Zhiqiaying and the garrison of the 3rd Regiment of the 37th Division at Guaizipu, killing their captain, Zhao Qingshan, and more than 20 men below the company commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 37th Division.
