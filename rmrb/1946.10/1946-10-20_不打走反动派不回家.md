　　I Won't Go Home Until the Reactionaries Are Defeated
    Li Daomin
    (I)
    On the evening of August 29th, I went to the ×× County government to receive the new recruits who had just been sent off with gongs and drums. There, I reviewed their motivations for joining the army one by one.
    "Why are you joining the army?"
    Standing in front of me was a dark-red youth named Xin Heichou.
    "To fight the reactionaries, to defend our good times." He answered my question succinctly, then focused his gaze on my face, as if saying, "Don't you understand this?"
    "Is your family's life good?" I asked again.
    "It wasn't good before, but it's good now!" He continued:
    "When I was a child, I herded cattle for others. When I got older, I became a hired hand. I don't know how much blood and sweat I shed. Even so, my old mother starved to death. The Communist Party came and the poor people stood up. After settling old scores, I was allocated five mu of land and three tile-roofed houses. This spring, I also got a 'free' wife. We have food and clothing. Isn't life good?"
    "Now I hear that the reactionaries want to fight a civil war and attack our liberated areas, wanting the landlords and despots to come back and oppress the poor. So I voluntarily came to join our Eighth Route Army to fight them. I won't go home until the reactionaries are defeated!"
    (II)
    Xin Heichou had been in the company for more than a month. He lived happily with his comrades every day, drilling and attending classes, and didn't feel the least bit constrained. He just looked forward to the day he could go to the front line and kill a few reactionaries. Therefore, he often wiped his gun until it shone and sharpened his bayonet until it gleamed.
    One afternoon, he received a letter from a family member, which read:
    "Heichou, my husband: You have been in the army for more than a month. Everything is fine at home. I just miss you very much. Please take some time to come home and see me!"...
    As soon as Heichou finished reading, he felt a fire rise in his heart. He glared at the person who brought the letter and said:
    "Go back and tell her! I won't go home until the reactionaries are defeated. If she can't wait, tell her to find someone else!"
    The troops were about to set off, and they all said they were going to Huixian to fight. Heichou was extremely happy. He thought, "I must kill a few reactionaries!"
    (III)
    The troops marched for two days. On the third day, they happened to pass by Heichou's home village—Xin Village. The families had long been standing outside the village, looking forward to their sons and husbands coming home to visit. Heichou's wife had been standing outside the village, waiting for Heichou to come. She thought: "Maybe he'll come home for a look, without delaying the troops' fighting."
    The troops passed by, the first company, the second company… all passed by.
    Finally, Heichou's wife saw Heichou. If there weren't so many people, she would have run over and grabbed Heichou's hand. But before she could open her mouth, Heichou spoke from afar:
    "Go back! I'm fine. Don't bother looking for me. I won't go home until the reactionaries are defeated!"
    Heichou's wife didn't say anything more and turned away.
    (IV)
    The Huixian Campaign began. With the determination to sacrifice himself, Heichou joined the assault team. In the battle to attack the city gate, he bravely climbed the ladder and continuously threw grenades at the enemy. He wasn't afraid at all of the sparks from the grenades in the dark night. Although he sustained two injuries, he still didn't leave the front line.
    But just as the enemy was about to surrender to us, a bullet pierced his chest, and he immediately fell down. Then he was carried to the hospital on a stretcher.
    Although Heichou was lying in the hospital, his heart was still thinking about the victory at the front. He often mumbled "Charge!" "Kill!" in his dreams.
    The news of Heichou's injury spread, and the villagers of Xin Village all brought comfort gifts to see him. Heichou's wife also went.
    She didn't quite trust the nurses in the hospital. She thought of taking him home to recuperate. When she said the words "Let's go home and recuperate," Heichou resolutely shook his head, indicating:
    "I won't go home until the reactionaries are defeated!"

　　不打走反动派不回家
    李导民
    （一）
    八月二十九日傍晚，我到××县政府去接收刚被锣鼓欢送来的新战士，在那里我一个一个的审查着他们的入伍动机。
    “你为什么参军？”
    在我面前站着的是一个黑红黑红的青年，他的名子叫辛黑丑。
    “为了打反动派，为了保卫好时光。”他简捷地回答我的问话，随后把目光集中在我的脸上，仿佛在说，这个道理你还不懂吧？
    “你家的时光好吗？”我又问。
    “从前不好，现在好啦！”他接着说下去：
    “我小时候给人家放牛，大一点便给人家当长工，不知道流了多少血汗，就这样，一个老娘还叫饿死了，共产党来了叫穷人翻身，算旧账，我才分到了五亩地三间瓦房，今年春天我又‘自由’了一个媳妇，有吃有穿，时光还过的不好？”
    “现在我听说反动派要打内战，进攻咱解放区，想着叫地主恶霸重回来压迫穷人，我便自动的来参加咱八路军和他干，不打走反动派不回来！”
    （二）
    辛黑丑下连一个多月了，每天出操上课都和同志们在一块高高兴兴的过生活，一点也不感到拘束，只是盼望着那一天上前线打死几个反动派，因此他常把枪擦的光油油的，把刺刀磨得明晃晃的。
    一天下午，他接到一个家属给他捎来的一封家信，上边写着：
    “黑丑我夫：你参军一月多了，家里的事情都很好，只是我很想你，请你抽空回家看看吧！”……
    黑丑刚看完心里就冒起火来，他瞪着眼睛对那个捎信的人说：
    “回去给她说吧！不打走反动派不回家，她要等不上，就叫她另去找个主吧！”
    部队要出发了，都说是要到辉县去打仗，黑丑可高兴极啦，他想“我非打死几个反动派不可”！
    （三）
    部队经过了两天的行军，第三天恰恰要过黑丑的家门——辛庄，家属们老早就站在村外眺望着自己的儿子、丈夫来家看看，黑丑的媳妇早就站在村外等着黑丑过来，她想：不耽误队伍打仗也许他会回家看看的。
    队伍过去了，一连、二连…………都过去了。
    终于黑丑的媳妇望见了黑丑，要不是人多，她早就跑过去拉着黑丑的手了，可是她还没有来得及张口，黑丑早远远的说话了：
    “回去吧！我很好，不用看我啦，我不打走反动派不回家！”
    黑丑媳妇再没有说什么，便扭头走了。
    （四）
    辉县战役开始了，黑丑抱着牺牲的决心，参加了突击组，在攻城关战斗中，他勇敢的爬上梯子，连续的用手榴弹投掷敌人，黑夜里手榴弹冒火花，他一点也不害怕，虽然他身上负了两处伤，但他依然没有下火线。
    可是当着敌人快要向我们缴枪的时候，一颗子弹穿过了他的胸膛，他立即倒下了，接着便被担架抬往医院。
    黑丑虽然躺在医院里，心却还在想着前方的胜利，他常在梦中哝哝的喊着“冲”！！！“杀”！！！
    黑丑负伤的消息传出来了，辛庄的老乡们都拿着慰劳品去看他，黑丑媳妇也去了。
    她对医院里的看护是不大放心的，她想着叫他回家去调养，当她说出“咱回家养去吧”的话时，黑丑坚决地摇摇头表示：
    “不打走反动派我不回家”！
