　　【Our Newspaper, Jingxing News】The masses of Bucun County are answering the enemy's sudden attacks and the sabotage of special agent landlords with an even more vigorous struggle for emancipation, shattering their conspiracy to jointly suppress the mass movement. Last month, the village conducted five days of liquidation struggles against special agent landlord ××, and the mood was extremely high. Unexpectedly, the special agent landlord shamelessly colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime and suddenly attacked the village masses on the sixth day. Afterwards, the special agent landlord and his henchmen took the opportunity to intimidate the masses and cadres, demanding that everyone stop the struggle. The things that should have been compensated to the masses were not compensated, and the things that should have been returned were not returned. Some backward masses also wavered as a result, fearing that "instead of hitting the wolf, they would be bitten." In order to reorganize the mass ranks, the comrades of the emancipation team working in the village seized the opportunity to guide the masses to discuss in groups, "Is it better to soften up? Or is it better to struggle?" After debate, everyone finally came to the unanimous conclusion: The softer we are, the harder the special agent landlords will be, and the harder it will be for us to live in the future. It is better to simply fight to the end, overwhelm the special agents so that they cannot operate, and the whole village will deal with the enemy in unison, which will be easier. So they united and launched an even more vigorous liquidation and debt collection struggle against the special agent landlords. The land and grain that should be taken out were taken out, and whoever should be returned to was returned immediately. After the masses obtained their due benefits, their fighting spirit became stronger and their ranks became more solid. The special agent landlord was forced to bow his head and dare not move again under the supervision of the masses. Now the masses are stepping up the organization of self-defense.

　　井陉群众坚决回答特务袭击
    卜村群运加倍猛进
    特务地主欺诈阴谋被粉碎
    【本报井陉讯】本县卜村群众以加倍猛烈的翻身斗争回答敌人的突击与特务地主的破坏，打破了他们联合压制群众运动的阴谋企图。上月份，该村连续对特务地主××进行了五天清算斗争，情绪至为高涨。不意特务地主竟无耻勾结蒋伪，于第六日突然袭击该村群众。事后特务地主及其爪牙即趁机威吓群众与干部，要大家停止斗争。该赔偿群众的东西也不赔了，该退的也不退了。部分落后群众也因此发生动摇，怕“打狼不成，反被咬伤”。在该村帮助工作的翻身队同志为重整群众阵营，乃抓紧引导群众分组讨论“软化好呢？还是斗争好？”经过争执，最后大家得出一致的结论：我们越软，特务地主越硬，以后越不能过。不如干脆斗到底，把特务压倒，使他们不能活动，全村一致对付敌人，就好办了。于是团结起来，向特务地主展开加倍猛烈的清算与要账斗争。要出地和粮食来，马上该退给谁就退，该赔偿谁就赔。群众获得应得利益后，斗志益坚，阵营益固。特务地主被迫低头闻迹，在群众监督下不敢再动。现群众正加紧组织自卫中。
