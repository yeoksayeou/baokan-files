　　Emancipated Peasants Work Diligently and Happily, Women's Competition Promotes Collective Autumn Harvest
    [This newspaper's Handan News] After the peasants of Zhangzhuangqiao in Handan City settled accounts with and struggled against the despotic landlords, they recovered the land that had been plundered, and their enthusiasm for production was exceptionally high. The peasants automatically adopted the method of collective labor and specific division of labor, and completed the autumn harvest and planting in less than two-thirds of the time it took in previous years. All the women in the village, under the leadership of the Women's Association, also actively participated in labor, not showing any weakness. When the cotton was ripe, they went to pick it together, and had already picked more than 2,000 catties of cotton in five consecutive times. When the millet was ripe, 94 women went to the fields together to cut the millet, cutting 30 mu in one day, and also cutting 6 mu of sorghum. When cutting millet, the land was divided into sections, and everyone competed. They were notified one day, and the next day they all arrived in the fields early, afraid of falling behind others. They also said, "The cutting must be careful and clean; this is our own!" Because women participated in the autumn harvest labor, the men were able to concentrate their efforts to quickly complete the autumn plowing. (Liu Lian)

　　翻身农民勤奋愉快妇女竞赛集体收秋
    【本报邯郸讯】邯市张庄桥农民经过对奸霸地主的清算斗争，收回被掠夺的土地，生产情绪异常高涨。农民们自动采用集体劳动、具体分工的办法，以少于往年三分之一的时间完成了秋收秋种。全村妇女在妇女会领导下，亦都积极参加劳动，毫不示弱。棉花熟了，即相率去摘，连续五次已摘花二千多斤。谷子熟了，九十四名妇女一起下地割谷，一天割了三十亩，还割了六亩高粱。割谷时按地分段，大家竞赛，头天通知，第二天一早就都到了地里，谁也怕落在别人后边。并说：“割的要仔细、干净；这是咱们自己的呀！”由于妇女参加秋收劳动，使男子得以集中大力迅速完成秋耕。（刘莲）
