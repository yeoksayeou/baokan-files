　　[Report from our correspondent in Weixian on the 5th] The Jinnan District Party Committee and Administrative Office's call to "Use all our strength to support the front lines and launch a donation and frugality movement" has been met with enthusiastic responses from all over. In Jize, all Party, government, and civilian cadres and Party members have enthusiastically donated over 240,000 yuan. Fifteen units of the Administrative Office donated over 90,000 yuan in the second round, and 2,436 jin of salary rice (equivalent to 97,440 yuan), totaling 373,440 yuan in two rounds. All students of the × County Primary School Teachers Training Class donated over 361,500 yuan and pledged to lead children in solving all difficulties for military families. At an education symposium in Nangong County, various district-level government offices and organizations donated a total of over 252,000 yuan and wrote many letters of慰问; the Guangzong Teachers Training Class donated over 33,600 yuan; in addition to donating over 28,200 yuan, the Fifth Prefectural Committee called on cadres at all levels to work hard to ensure that farmers thoroughly turn themselves over; the Fourth Prefectural Committee also donated 4,448 yuan. In this movement to support the front lines, many exemplary cadres and Party members have emerged. Yang, the Speaker of the Jize People's Council, sold four sheep he had raised for 10,000 yuan and donated the money to the front lines. Hua Zhuniang, a women's cadre in the First District, donated all 1,000 yuan she earned from spinning and weaving. Cui Zhicheng, a farmer from Huangsha Village, donated 2,000 yuan, saying, "The Eighth Route Army is risking their lives and shedding blood on the front lines to defend the land we have gained after liberation. We will help the soldiers on the front lines even if we don't use lights or eat oil, so they don't have to suffer." Wang Leihu from the North District said when donating money, "If we don't drive Chiang back, poor people will still not be able to live well." Currently, the donation and frugality movement is deepening from village to household throughout Jinnan. All staff of the Jinnan Agricultural Experiment Station sold grass clippings for 21,465 yuan and saved 510 yuan from vegetable funds to buy a disabled cow, made it into beef jerky, packed it into慰问 bags, and sent it to the soldiers on the front lines. Hao Zhengyi, a student of the judicial science program at the Jianguo College, whose family is very poor, donated all 1,200 yuan he usually saves for his family during this donation. When others tried to dissuade him, he firmly said, "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army protecting us on the front lines, we wouldn't even have a home."
