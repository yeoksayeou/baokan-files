Xinhua News Agency report: The British Conservative Party held its annual meeting in Blackpool on the 3rd of this month, lasting three days. This was the party's first annual meeting since its defeat in the general election last year, with 5,000 representatives attending. During the meeting on the 3rd, the party debated the issue of establishing a united anti-Labour front. The meeting rejected the proposal of a Conservative-Liberal coalition to form an anti-Labour front and passed a resolution to absorb all elements dissatisfied with the two parties in order to expand the Conservative Party's influence. Another resolution expressed dissatisfaction with the Labour government's measures restricting private property expansion in housing. On the 4th, the meeting passed a resolution on the Indian question. Churchill delivered a speech at the meeting on the 5th, stating that he would retain his leadership position to deal with the current "extremely serious" situation. Churchill severely criticized the Labour authorities' policies toward colonies such as India, Palestine, and Burma, and lamented the decline of the British Empire. Churchill said that the current Labour government is "unable to maintain Britain's position in the world," and the number of British subjects is decreasing to a quarter of what it has been for generations. "It seems that in the near future, India will become a separate and not-too-friendly foreign country, and Burma may suffer the same fate as India." "These things are happening every day, every hour; a large ship is sinking in a silent sea." Churchill also expressed great dissatisfaction with the Labour government's measures regarding food, coal, and other aspects, but welcomed the Labour authorities' efforts to oppose the British Communist Party.

　　英保守党举行年会
    邱吉尔为帝国衰落哀叹
    新华社讯：英保守党于本月三日在布拉克浦尔“黑池”举行年会，会期三日，这是该党自去年大选失败后的首次年会，出席代表达五千名。三日会议上，该党曾就建立反工党联合阵线问题展开辩论，会议中否决了保守党与自由党联合以组成反工党阵线的提议，而通过了吸收一切不满二党分子，以扩大保守党声势之决议。该党另一决议不满工党政府限制私人在住宅问题上扩展私有产的措施。四日会上则通过了对印度问题的决议案。邱吉尔在五日会上发表演说，他声明要保留其领袖地位，以应付目前“异常严重”的局势。邱氏对工党当局对印度、巴勒斯坦与缅甸等殖民地的政策加以严厉抨击，并对大英帝国的衰落不胜感慨。邱氏说：目前工党政府“无能维持英国在世界上的地位”，英王臣民的数量正减少到它若干代以来数量的四分之一。“似乎在不久将来印度将成为一个分离的而且不会是太友谊的外国，而缅甸或亦将遭受与印度相同的命运”，“每天每小时这些事情都在发生，一艘大船正在沉寂的大海上沉落中”。邱氏并对工党政府粮食煤炭等各方面的措施大表不满，可是对工党当局之反对英国共产党的努力则表示欢迎。
