　　Democratic National Construction Army Strengthens Military-Civilian Unity
    Invites Government and Civilians to Discuss Mutual Relations
    [Our Newspaper] The Democratic National Construction Army convened a military-civilian symposium at its garrison on the 3rd and 4th of this month. More than 60 people attended, including cadres above the regimental commander and director level, and local government cadres. Commander-in-Chief Gao first explained the purpose of the meeting: to review the past military-government and military-civilian relations, and to decide on future improvement measures. He called on everyone to adopt the spirit of "saying everything you know and saying it without reservation," to do truly humble self-criticism, and to provide each other with opinions. Subsequently, local cadres spoke, and everyone unanimously pointed out the rapid progress of the troops in the past six months; during the mass movement, the troops supported the masses and brought out the things hidden by the local tyrants in the past. Some battalions and companies even directly participated in the mass movement in their garrisons, which greatly promoted the movement. Many garrisons in various places had resolved misunderstandings and estrangement with local mass cadres through small-scale military-government-civilian symposiums. Then, Commander Qiao, Division Commander Chen, Division Commander Tian and others spoke in succession; on the one hand, they explained the help of the masses to the cadres, and on the other hand, they also pointed out some shortcomings in the local work. Finally, after discussion, the following nine measures were established to improve military-civilian relations in the future:
    (1) The livestock of the masses used for corvee labor should be limited to transporting grain and coal. When corvee labor is needed, a government corvee certificate is required. During the busy farming season, corvee labor should be reduced or stopped as much as possible. The use of civilian labor must be paid for at the price or through exchange labor. (2) The existing struggle targets hidden in the troops should be cleared and handed over to the local authorities for processing. (3) Farm tools borrowed should be returned immediately upon borrowing, and compensation should be made for damage. (4) Housing should be arranged in such a way that it does not hinder mass production. Necessary dispersion should be implemented in places that are too crowded. (5) It is strictly forbidden for the troops to take the fruits of mass production or damage the production tools of the masses. (6) Personnel of the troops going out should be subject to inspection by local sentries. The local authorities shall not make things difficult for the soldiers, and the troops are not allowed to make things difficult for local cadres and the masses. Education on supporting the government and loving the people, and supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers should be carried out among the troops and the masses. (7) Regular symposiums and joint meetings should be held to maintain close contact. Both sides should send representatives to participate in important meetings. (8) The troops are not allowed to borrow grain or firewood from the masses. The troops' production personnel and livestock going out should be given grain coupons, food money and feed tickets and grass money to the masses. (9) The military and civilians should cooperate to eliminate special agents from the troops and local areas.

    【本报讯】民主建国军于本月三四两日，在驻地召开军民座谈会。到会有团长主任以上干部及驻地政权干部等六十余人。首由高总司令说明开会目的是：检讨过去军政军民关系，并决定今后改进办法，他号召大家本“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，做真正虚心的自我批评，并互相提供意见。旋由地方干部发言，大家一致指出：部队半年来的飞跃进步；群运中部队曾给群众撑腰，把恶霸过去隐藏的东西拿出来。有的营连甚至直接参加了驻地的群运，对运动有很大推动作用，各地驻军不少均曾以小型的军政民座谈会方式，与地方上群众干部间解除了误会与隔阂。接着乔军长、陈师长、田师长等均相继发言；一方面说明群众对干部的帮助，另方面也指出地方工作上的若干缺点，最后经大家讨论，对以后军民关系的改进，定出以下九项办法：
    （一）支差的群众牲口，只限于运粮运煤，要差时需持政府拨差证，农忙时应尽量减少或停止支差，使用民力必须按价给以工资或实行变工。（二）清理部队中现藏斗争对象通交地方处理。（三）借用农具应做到随借随还，损坏赔偿。（四）在不妨碍群众生产的条件下住民房，太挤的地方实行必要的分散。（五）严禁部队拿取群众的生产果实及损坏群众的生产工具。（六）部队外出人员，应受地方岗哨检查，地方不得非难军人，部队亦不准非难地方干部及群众。应在部队和群众中进行拥政爱民，拥军优抗之教育。（七）常开座谈会，联席会以密切联系，双方召开重要会议，应互派代表参加。（八）不准部队向群众借粮、借柴草。部队外出生产人员牲口，应给群众粮票菜金和料票草钱。（九）军民配合肃清部队和地方特务分子。
