　　The Emotions of a Liberated Peasant
    Zhang Tinghe Hates the Traitor Chiang and Takes Out His Privately Stored Heavy Machine Gun to Kill the Enemy
    [Report from Changzhi, October 15th by this newspaper] Zhang Tinghe, a peasant from Daopengyan Village in Lin County, has further realized after being liberated that the Eighth Route Army is his backing, and he is extremely resentful of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a traitorous civil war. At a recent mobilization rally for the patriotic self-defense war, he presented a heavy machine gun to the Eighth Route Army, which had been discarded by Pang and Sun when they surrendered to the enemy in 1943, and which he had picked up and preserved to this day. The masses present applauded warmly.
