　　Xing City Foreign Goods and Sundries Merchants
    Launch Movement to Serve the Countryside
    500 Million Capital Will Switch to Operating in Furs and Local Products
    [Report from this newspaper in Xingtai] Xing City's foreign goods and sundries merchants have recently launched a movement to serve the countryside. 500 million in Xingtai's foreign goods and sundries capital will soon switch to operating in local products or investing in various industries and handicrafts. On October 2nd, they held a conversion conference. Many foreign goods merchants who switched industries in the spring and achieved high profits recounted their personal experiences, calling on everyone to break away from the economic chains of imperialism and embark on a new path to wealth and prosperity. Guo Jingru, manager of Xing City National Industrialist Jingxing Iron Factory, Wu Xiangting, chairman of the fur trade, and representatives of Zhida Textile Factory and Yuhua Transportation Company textile industry all welcomed foreign goods and sundries merchants to invest in fur, ironwork, and textile businesses. The manager of Henglidong Foreign Company reviewed his painful experience since spring, waiting for high prices and consuming more than 2 million, reflecting on his illusion of peace, continuing to operate in foreign goods, and thinking that "every industry is like a different mountain." He put forward a conversion plan to invest most of his capital in fur and the transportation and sale of local products. Now he has bought several thousand catties of peppercorns and several hundred catties of hemp. Merchants from foreign goods stores also expressed that they would exchange all foreign goods for local goods and luxury goods for the necessities of the people during the Xing City Temple Fair on October 18 (lunar calendar). At the conference, the Xingtai Municipal Government also rewarded Yongfeng Cloth Shop, Yongan Textile Factory, Zhida Textile Factory, Fulin No. 5, and Tianzengcheng, models of automatic conversion to operating local products and investing in handicrafts since the spring. After the conference, the fur market on Yangshi Street has seen activity and investment from foreign goods merchants on North Main Street. According to Xing City's industrial and commercial authorities, this movement will completely change the face of Xing City's market and establish a new democratic market.
