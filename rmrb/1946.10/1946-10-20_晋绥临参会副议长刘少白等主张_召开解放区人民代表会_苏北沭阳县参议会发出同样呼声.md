Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 17th: Liu Shaobai, Vice Chairman of the Jin-Sui Border Region Provisional Assembly, Sun Liangcheng, President of the Higher People's Court, Fan [unclear character]ru, Director of the Construction Department of the Administrative Office, and Mr. Niu Youlan, a member of the Border Region Assembly, recently expressed their views to reporters, enthusiastically responding to the "Movement for the Withdrawal of American Troops from China" and demanding the convocation of people's representative conferences in the liberated areas. Vice Chairman Liu stated: The result of Marshall's coming to China for "impartial mediation" is that the scale of the Chinese civil war has escalated, which fully proves that Marshall is helping Chiang Kai-shek wage a civil war under the guise of mediation. I propose that we convene people's representative conferences in the liberated areas. President Sun attacked American imperialism from a legal point of view, stating that the presence of American land, sea, and air forces in China completely violates the territory and sovereignty of an independent country, and therefore the entire Chinese people must resolutely oppose it. Director Fan said: "One of the ambitions of the American reactionaries is to seize China's economic power and turn China into its colony, and Chiang Kai-shek, in order to pursue dictatorship and autocracy, does not hesitate to completely sell China's territory, territorial waters, airspace, and inland river navigation rights to the United States. This is too base and shameless." Director Fan expressed with indignation: "American troops must withdraw from China, and Chiang Kai-shek must withdraw from all occupied areas." Mr. Niu Youlan said: "We Chinese people must not allow American imperialism to run rampant in China. Everyone should work together to make American troops withdraw from China."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: The Shuyang County Assembly in northern Jiangsu recently sent a telegram to the preparatory committee for the People's Representative Conference in the Yan'an Liberated Area on behalf of the county's 320,000 people, advocating the speedy convocation of a People's Representative Conference in the liberated area to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's one-party-controlled "National Assembly." The telegram stated: "Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, commands his troops equipped with American weapons, stepping up the offensive against the liberated areas (Shuyang City was subjected to nine air raids in one day, September 23rd); on the other hand, he is staging his one-party-controlled 'National Assembly' and announced that it will open on November 12th. The scene in the background is expected to be nothing more than the formulation of a one-party 'constitution' and the promotion of Chiang Kai-shek as a puppet emperor (the so-called 'President'). Then, he will pretend and say: 'I now represent the will of the people!' Thus, all of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary measures will be considered 'legal.' Now is the time. Let Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen participate in Chiang Kai-shek's National Assembly. We, representing only the 320,000 people of Shuyang County, advocate the immediate convocation of a People's Representative Conference in the liberated area to establish the highest leadership organization in the liberated area, unify the leadership of the 140 million people in the entire liberated area, and establish our ideal happy new democratic political and economic life, until finally smashing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and disastrous fascist rule, so that the people of the whole country can universally enjoy freedom, democracy, and happiness!"

　　晋绥临参会副议长刘少白等主张
    召开解放区人民代表会
    苏北沭阳县参议会发出同样呼声
    【新华社兴县十七日电】晋绥边区临参会副议长刘少白、高等法院院长孙良成、行署建设处长樊＠①如、边区参议员牛友兰诸先生，顷对记者发表意见，热烈响应“美军退出中国运动”，并要求召开解放区人民代表会议。刘副议长称：马歇尔来中国“公正调解”的结果，使中国内战的规模愈演愈大，这完全证明马歇尔以调解为名，实则帮助蒋介石进行内战，我提议我们召开解放区人民代表会议。孙院长从法律观点抨击美帝国主义，以海陆空军驻在中国完全侵犯了一个独立国家的领土和主权，因之全中国人民要坚决反对。樊处长说：“美国反动派野心之一，是想攫取中国的经济权，使中国变为它的殖民地，而蒋介石为了独裁专制，不惜将中国的领土、领海、领空、内河航行权完全出卖给美国，这太卑劣无耻了。”樊处长愤激的表示：“美军必须退出中国，蒋介石必须退出一切侵占区去”。牛友兰先生说：“我们中国人民决不能让美帝国主义在中国横行无忌，大家应一致努力要美军从中国撤退”。
    【新华社华中十六日电】苏北沭阳县参议会顷代表该县三十二万人民，致电延安解放区人民代表大会筹备会，主张从速召开解放区人民代表大会，反对蒋介石一党包办的“国民大会”。该电略称：“蒋介石一手指挥其手执美国武器的军队，加紧对解放区的进攻，（沭阳城在九月二十三日一天中即连遭九次空袭）；一手正扮演其一党包办的“国民大会”，并宣告准于十一月十二日揭幕表演。其幕中场景，预料不外是制定一党“宪法”，抬出蒋介石作儿皇帝（所谓“大总统”）之类的猢狲戏。然后，便装腔作势的说：“我如今已是代表了民意啊！”于是，蒋介石的一切反动措施便算“合法”的了。现在是时候了，蒋介石的国民大会，让蒋家的喽啸们去参加吧，我们仅代表沭阳县三十二万人民，主张立即召开解放区人民代表大会，成立解放区最高领导机构，统一领导全解放区一万万四千万人民，建立自己理想的幸福的新民主主义政治、经济生活，直至最后粉碎蒋介石卖国殃民的法西斯统治，使全国人民普遍享受自由、民主、和幸福！”
