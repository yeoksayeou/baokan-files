　　Cadres and Masses in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei Regions Actively Contribute to Support the Front
	Donating 20 Million to Console the Troops
　　[Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 11th] The soldiers of the border region are fiercely attacking the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops invading the Hebei-Shandong-Henan hinterland, and the people in various regions have launched a widespread and enthusiastic movement to support the troops. The fundraising and donations in just 13 counties, including Juancheng and Puyang, have reached more than 16 million yuan. In Juancheng County alone, the masses raised 4 million yuan in five days. Tenant farmer Wang Zhitian donated 500 yuan. He used to suffer from hunger and cold, but after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, he turned over and improved his life. He said, "I will never forget the Eighth Route Army's life-saving grace." Liu Zhengye, a tenant farmer from Zhang Village, had been farming for more than 20 years. Only after the arrival of the Eighth Route Army did he have food to eat, so he also donated 500 yuan. More than 100 representatives were elected by 200,000 people in ×× (code unclear) County to form a comfort delegation to visit the field hospital to console the troops. The districts raised 4.9 million yuan in ten days. Zhai Dongyuan from Dayue Village in the First District was afraid of being drafted by Chiang Kai-shek's forces outside the pass. After fleeing back inside the pass, he encountered Chiang Kai-shek's massive offensive and took out 1,000 yuan to support the troops. Huang Wenqing, from the Eighth District of Changyuan, became wealthy by opening an oil mill under the commercial policies promoted by the democratic government. He deeply resented Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and voluntarily donated 3,500 yuan to support the troops. The masses in the Second District of Kunwu donated 2 million yuan. More than 90 local gentry in Dongxiao District discussed fundraising issues in Jin'gangji. Mr. Fan Peihou said, "The liberated areas are so happy, everyone is equal, and everyone has food to eat. If old Chiang comes over, the poor and the rich will not be able to survive." He immediately donated 99,000 yuan and more than ten bags of wheat, and said to the district staff, "Please don't forget my intentions and write a letter to the front-line soldiers saying: Work hard to fight old Chiang! We, the common people, will resolutely help." Liu Chuanbang's mother, who is over sixty years old, carried forty to fifty catties of wheat to donate grain. Three hundred and ten primary school teachers in Weinan formed a labor army committee to enthusiastically raise donations. Twelve male and female teachers in the First District generously donated 14,200 yuan. The Sixth District of Yunjü donated up to 3 million yuan. In the Qingfu Association competition in Gaolouji, a small village of fifty households donated 16,000 yuan.
　　[Report from this newspaper in Weixian on the 12th] Party, government, military, and civilian organizations in the Southern Hebei District, as well as cadres and masses in the ten counties of Jize, Feixiang, Cheng'an, Guangping, Qiuxian, Yongnian, Qüzhou, Handan, and Chengci, enthusiastically donated money to support the front lines, reaching more than 5.6 million yuan in the past five days. Correspondents Cui Xitao and cook Xing Zhen each donated 300 yuan, saying, "We cannot go to the front lines, but we should actively work in the rear and save more to support our brothers on the front lines." The female comrades of various organizations are busy making various comfort bags.
