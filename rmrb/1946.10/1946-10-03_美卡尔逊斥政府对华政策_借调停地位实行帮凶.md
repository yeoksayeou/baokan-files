　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. According to a broadcast from Radio Moscow today: Carlson, Chairman of the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, issued a statement to the press on the 26th, criticizing the US policy towards China, saying: In the internal struggle in China, the US government is interfering in China's internal affairs by helping one side under the guise of "mediation." This behavior contradicts Truman's statement last December. The US policy in China not only disregards but further undermines the democratic movement of the broad masses of people and tries to prevent public opinion from making suggestions to US foreign policy.
    Another dispatch: New York Post reporter Martin wrote that American congressmen who had traveled in China said that it seemed the Soviet Union was secretly helping the Chinese Communist Party, which is obviously an indisputable rumor. Martin pointed out that these congressmen, living in Shanghai, spent all their time in the glittering nightlife. If they could have a little understanding of the situation in China, it would be more beneficial to the matter.

　　美卡尔逊斥政府对华政策
    借调停地位实行帮凶
    【新华社延安三十日电】据莫斯科今日广播：美民主远东政策委员会主席卡尔逊，二十六日向报界发表声明斥责美国对华政策称：美国政府在中国内部斗争中，以“调停”地位帮助一方面的方法干涉中国内政，此种行为与去年十二月杜鲁门的声明相矛盾。美国在华的政策，不仅轻视而且进一步摧残广大人民的民主运动，并力图阻止社会舆论向美国对外政策提出建议。
    又讯：纽约邮报记者马丁著文称：游历中国的美国议员曾说似乎苏联在秘密地帮助中国共产党，这显然是一种无可争辩的谣言。马丁指出，这些旅居上海的议员老爷们，把所有时间都花费在灯红酒绿的夜晚娱乐中，假使他们能稍为了解一下中国的情况，那么对事情会更有利些。
