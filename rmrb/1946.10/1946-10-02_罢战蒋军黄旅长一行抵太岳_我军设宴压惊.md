　　[This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Yangcheng on the 30th] Huang Zhengcheng, the brigade commander (originally referred to as division commander) of the First Brigade of the First Division of Hu Zongnan, and Liu Yushu, the commander of the First Regiment, along with over 300 officers above the rank of lieutenant, who were forced to lay down their arms in the victorious self-defense counterattack by the Eighth Route Army in Fushan, southern Shanxi, arrived at the Taiyue Military Region headquarters on the 26th. Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng, a native of Zhejiang, spoke with a thick local accent. He was slender, and because he was preparing to be captured during the battle, he had already changed his handsome Chiang Kai-shek uniform for a soldier's outfit, but he hadn't had time to change his trousers, and was still wearing his original whipcord riding breeches. Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng claimed to have graduated from the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy and had studied at a German military academy. The second person to attract attention was Liu Yushu, the commander of the First Regiment of the First Brigade, a native of southern Hunan. He had bandages wrapped around his head by an Eighth Route Army medic, wore an American khaki uniform, and sported a modern American-style belt. He appeared dispirited. The Eighth Route Army specially hosted a banquet on that day to alleviate their shock. Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng spoke at length about the reasons for the First Brigade's defeat and expressed his amazement at the Eighth Route Army's rapid and heroic actions, especially the organization and awareness of the liberated area's masses. Regiment Commander Liu repeatedly said: "The Eighth Route Army soldiers fight because they want to live freely, so the more they fight, the braver they become. But the Central Army soldiers fight for a few people, and the more they fight, the less they want to live, the less they want to fight." At the same time, Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng and others expressed their gratitude for the Eighth Route Army's preferential treatment, which extended even to every soldier. Regiment Commander Liu was even more grateful to the Eighth Route Army medic for immediately bandaging his wounds on the battlefield. He said, "Only the Eighth Route Army can do this." Other officers expressed their gratitude one after another, and some said, "We only know today that we took the wrong path!"

　　罢战蒋军黄旅长一行抵太岳
    我军设宴压惊
    【本报阳城三十日电】山西南部八路军在浮山自卫反击大捷中被迫放下武器的胡宗南第一师第一旅旅长（原称师）黄正成、第一团团长刘玉树书及尉官以上一行三百余人，于二十六日到达我太岳军区驻地。黄正成旅长浙江人，操着满口家乡土语，瘦长的身材，因为在战斗中准备俘虏，已将漂亮的蒋军服装改换成士兵服装，但下身来不及换，尚穿着原来的哔叽马裤。黄正成旅长自称在黄埔六期毕业，曾经留学德国军官学校。第二位被人注意的是第一旅第一团团长刘玉书，湘南人，头上缠着八路军卫生员所包扎的绷带，身着美国卡叽布军服，腰束美国最新式的玻璃带，精神萎糜。八路军特于是日设宴为他们压惊。黄正成旅长纵谈第一旅失败原因及对八路军的此次神速英勇，特别是解放区群众的组织与觉悟惊叹不绝。刘团长连称：“八路军士兵为着自己要自由的活下去才打仗，所以越打越勇敢，而中央军士兵为少数人打仗，越打越活不下去，越不愿打。”同时黄正成旅长等表示感谢八路军的优待，甚至每个士兵都是如此。刘团长更感谢八路军卫生员在战场上立即与他包扎伤口。他说：“这只有八路军才能做到。”其他军官纷纷表示感谢，有的人说：“咱们今天才知道路走错了！”
