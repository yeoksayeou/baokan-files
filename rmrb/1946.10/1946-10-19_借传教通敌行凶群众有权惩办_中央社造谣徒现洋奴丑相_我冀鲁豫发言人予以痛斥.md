　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region News, 15th] The Central News Agency's Nanjing dispatch on September 20th stated: "Ten Catholic priests and nuns in Caozhou, Shandong, were all detained and humiliated by the Communist army." According to authoritative sources in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region: Freedom of religious belief in the liberated areas has long been known to Chinese and foreign people. Catholic figures in various places have repeatedly praised the freedom of religious belief in the liberated areas, and the human rights and property rights of the church have been fully guaranteed. The Central News Agency's so-called detention and humiliation of Catholic priests in Caozhou is a distortion of the facts and a criminal propaganda attempt to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and foreign people. The Caozhou (i.e., Heze) Catholic Church was controlled by certain imperialist elements as early as the Boxer Rebellion, and became a criminal organization that oppressed and slaughtered our compatriots. The local people could not bear it and burned down the church. After the Eight-Nation Alliance captured Beijing, the Qing government humbled itself and negotiated for peace, spending a huge sum to rebuild the Heze Church. From then on, for more than 50 years, the oppression and humiliation of our compatriots by foreign priests in the church became even more intensified. After the July 7th Incident, foreign priests in the church, such as He Fangji and Ma Deluo, colluded with the enemy and puppets to brutally murder soldiers and civilians resisting Japan. Ma Jialuo helped the traitor Wang Wenxian manufacture batteries to contact the Japanese invaders. Wang gave Ma Jialuo a daily subsidy of 400 catties of wheat. On May 14, 1939, He Fangji led Japanese troops from Jining to surround Danianzhuang (70 miles northeast of Heze) and attacked the Eighth Route Army's Yellow River Detachment. On September 13, 1944, Ma Jialuo led Japanese troops to "mop up" everywhere, slaughtering 12 farmers in Libalao Village, robbing 13 livestock, searching for 106 guns stored by the Eighth Route Army, and robbing 130 iron pots from the common people. As for crimes such as forcibly occupying civilian houses, raping women, extorting money, and engaging in usury, they are too numerous to mention. After the liberation of Heze, people from all walks of life filed complaints with the Heze Municipal Government about the crimes of the priests of the Catholic Church, receiving more than 100 complaints. On August 25th, at the request of the people, the government held a 20,000-person reasoning conference in Heze City, which lasted for three days. Many old people came from hundreds of miles away at night with lanterns to testify. Many white-haired old women accused the Catholic Church of its past oppression, and wept bitterly. On the third day of the conference, more than 120 people complained about their suffering. He Fangji and others admitted to all kinds of crimes in public. However, the Central News Agency completely obliterates the facts, deliberately reverses black and white, and speaks for the enemy and traitors, which has completely exposed its lack of national concept and its ugly features of being a foreign slave.

　　借传教通敌行凶群众有权惩办
    中央社造谣徒现洋奴丑相
    我冀鲁豫发言人予以痛斥
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】中央社南京九月二十日电称：“山东曹州天主教男女教士十人，均为共军拘禁凌辱”。据冀鲁豫区权威人士称：解放区信教自由，早为中外人士所共悉，各地天主教人士曾屡次盛赞解放区信教自由，教会人权财权获得充分保障。中央社所谓曹州天主教士被拘禁凌辱等等，实为歪曲事实，企图破坏中外人民友谊的罪恶宣传。曹州（即荷泽）天主教堂远于义和团起义时即被某些帝国主义分子所掌握，成为压迫屠杀我向胞之犯罪机关，当地人民忍无可忍，曾将该教堂焚毁，八国联军陷北京后，清廷屈膝请和，以巨款重修荷泽教堂，从此五十多年以来该教堂之外籍神甫对我同胞之压迫凌辱，益变本加厉。七七事变后，该教堂外籍神甫何方济、马得罗等更结合敌伪、残杀抗日军民，马加罗帮助汉奸王文宪制造电池，与日寇联络，王逆则每天津贴马加罗四百斤麦子。二十八年五月十四日，何方济带领济宁日军包围大年庄（荷泽东北七十里），袭击八路军黄河支队。三十三年九月十三日，马加罗带领日军四出“扫荡”，屠杀李八老庄农民十二人，抢去牲口十三头，搜去八路军存枪一百零六支，抢去老百姓铁锅一百三十口。至于强占民房、强奸民女、讹诈勒索、高利盘剥等罪行，更是罄竹难书，举不胜举。荷泽解放后，各界公民纷纷向荷泽市政府控诉该天主教堂神甫之罪行，先后收到控诉书百余件。八月二十五日政府应人民之请，在荷泽市举行两万余人之讲理大会，会议继续三日，许多老百姓黑夜提灯从百里外赶来作证。不少白发老太婆控诉过去受天主教堂压迫惨状，声泪俱下。大会第三日群众诉苦者即达一百二十余人。所举各种罪行，何方济等均当众承认不讳。但中央社却完全抹杀事实，有意颠倒黑白，为敌奸分子张目，实已完全暴露其毫无国家民族观念，甘充洋奴才的丑相。
