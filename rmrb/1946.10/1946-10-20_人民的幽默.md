　　The People's Humor
    During a current affairs discussion, a worker stood up and said, "Chiang Kai-shek's fight in the civil war is like hitting his own father!" Everyone asked for the reason. He continued, "When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, he initiated the Three Principles of the People, implemented the Three Great Policies, and advocated the establishment of an independent, democratic, and peaceful new China. After Mr. Sun's death, he was honored as the Father of the Nation. The unfilial descendant Chiang Kai-shek disregarded the Father of the Nation's propositions and implemented national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war. Isn't this hitting his own father? Furthermore, food and clothing are parents. Chiang Kai-shek eats the people's food and wears the people's clothing, and today he is an enemy of the people. Isn't this hitting his own father?" After hearing this, everyone burst into laughter. (Jin Bo)

　　人民的幽默
    在时事讨论中，有一位工人站起来发言，他说：“蒋介石打内战是打他的爹！”众人问是什么理由？他接着说道：“孙中山先生在世时创导三民主义，实行三大政策，主张建立一个独立、民主、和平的新中国，孙先生死后称为国父，不孝子孙蒋介石视国父主张于不顾，实行卖国，独裁，内战，这不是在打他的爹吗？再说，衣食是父母，蒋介石吃着百姓的穿着百姓的，今天与百姓为敌，这不是打他的爹吗？”众人听罢，不觉哄然大笑。（金波）
