Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Line, 2nd (Evening Dispatch): Chiang Kai-shek's troops, dispatched from Nankou to invade the outer areas of Zhangjiakou, Huailai and Yanqing, namely the 16th Army, 94th Division, and 22nd Division, have met with fierce resistance from the Eighth Route Army. On September 30th, Chiang's troops, with the entire 94th Division, launched an all-out attack on the Kangzhuang area, firing over a thousand shells and launching more than ten assaults, all of which were repelled, resulting in over 400 casualties for Chiang's officers and soldiers. The Eighth Route Army, having achieved its mission of annihilating Chiang's forces, took the initiative to withdraw from Kangzhuang at 6 p.m. that day. On the 2nd, this unit of Chiang's troops continued its westward invasion, advancing to Huoshiying, east of Huailai, and stationing around Quanzi, Dongxihuayuan. This morning (the 2nd) at 9 a.m., Chiang's troops continued their attack on the Eighth Route Army's position at Shuiquan. After several days of intense fighting, the Shuiquan position is still firmly defended by the Eighth Route Army. The 24th Division of Chiang's troops, advancing towards Yanqing, invaded the Xiaozhangjiakou and Daxiaonihe line from Chenjia Yaozi with a regiment's strength on September 30th. On the 1st, they continued to invade Xiatun and areas west of the city of Yanqing, and continued to counterattack the Eighth Route Army's position at Baiyanquan. From the 1st until the evening of the 2nd, as of the time of this dispatch, the fierce fighting has not yet ceased, and Chiang's troops' numerous frontal assaults have been repelled.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st: This reporter has witnessed the fervent scenes of the masses, regardless of gender, age, or social status, wholeheartedly serving the front lines day and night in the areas near the front along the Ping-Sui railway line. This is deeply touching. A few days ago, over 100,000 jin of flour were transported to a small town called Jiangshacheng, west of Huailai on the Ping-Sui railway. Upon hearing that it was for supplying the Eighth Route Army at the front, over a thousand villagers from the entire town immediately gathered voluntarily, with many elderly people requesting to participate. Shi Fujin, a 71-year-old man from Shengli Street,拄着拐杖, and his young grandson carried several bags back and forth. A county cadre tried to persuade the old man to rest, but he replied sternly: "If Chiang Kai-shek comes, everyone, young and old, will suffer together. I am old and cannot carry much, but I can carry a bag together with my grandson." Yang, a 59-year-old woman with bound feet, also came with her daughter-in-law. She suggested that she and another old woman carry a bag together. Li Longgen, a merchant from Xuanhua visiting relatives here, also happily took off his long gown and helped the villagers carry the flour back and forth. He said: "It is everyone's responsibility to defend Chahar, regardless of which city or town we are from. Everyone should work together!" Over 100,000 jin of flour were transported in less than half a day thanks to the concerted efforts of the entire village.
