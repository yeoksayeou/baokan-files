　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 29th, the "Get Out of China Week" movement, launched by the American Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, has vigorously unfolded in thirty-five cities across the United States since September 22nd. Each city simultaneously held mass rallies, with a total of 450,000 participants, forming a powerful torrent "demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from China" and "cessation of interference in China's internal affairs." The American Committee for Peace issued a statement to the press on the 28th, stating: "The rallies in thirty-five cities in the United States, attended by 450,000 people, have cabled Truman demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from China." The committee also presented to the press two telegrams from Chinese democratic writers and newspaper editors, expressing gratitude for the "American Get Out of China Week movement" held by the American people. The Committee for Peace was formed in April of this year by progressive organizations such as the National Citizens Political Action Committee, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, the National Lawyers Guild, the American-Soviet Friendship Association, as well as former Secretary of the Interior Ickes, former Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davies, Roosevelt (son of the late President Roosevelt), and progressive congressmen Sabath, Pepper, and DeLacy. The committee firmly advocates international cooperation and opposes the US anti-Soviet and imperialist foreign policy, striving for lasting world peace. The Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy is composed of prominent American journalists Snow, Stein, Forman, and other social figures, opposing the imperialist policies of American reactionaries towards the Far East and China. When Bernays, through reactionary Senator George, submitted the Military Aid to China Act to Congress, the committee expressed its opposition to its passage.
