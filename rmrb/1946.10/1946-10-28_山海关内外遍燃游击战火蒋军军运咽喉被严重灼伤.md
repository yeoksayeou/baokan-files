　　Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-East Front, October 21st: (Delayed Dispatch) The flames of the people's guerrilla warfare outside Shanhaiguan have severely scorched the lifeline connecting the Chiang troops in North China and Northeast China, making it difficult for the Chiang troops to transport supplies. All highways and main roads along the Beining Railway (Great Wall section) have been severely damaged by the militia, and more than 1,000 rails, more than 1,000 catties of spikes, and countless sleepers have been recovered. On the 7th of this month, a train of 14 coal cars of the Chiang troops derailed in the Kaiping area, colliding with a train of 13 military cars coming from the east, completely destroying the locomotives. Militia activity is unpredictable along the railway line. According to incomplete statistics for the first half of last month, the militia, acting independently, killed or wounded more than 70 Chiang and puppet soldiers, captured 2 alive, and seized a portion of American equipment. The Lin Yu Military Committee has successively held blasting training classes. Each village has selected 180 landmine experts. Their techniques are improving day by day. On average, each person can complete the laying of tread or contact mines within three to five minutes. They have now returned to their villages to lead militia activities. A few days ago, landmine experts of the militia near Madaoling tried their skills for the first time, and four landmines killed 17 Chiang soldiers and officers. The increasingly active sparrow warfare and landmine warfare in the villages of Lulong make the Chiang and puppet troops feel the pain of "difficulty in traveling" and "difficulty in lodging" everywhere. On September 6th, the Chiang troops invading Yanheying, fearing landmines, detoured on small roads, and their daily speed was only 20-odd li. After occupying Yanheying, the headquarters encountered a large landmine when entering the gate, killing seven Chiang soldiers. Fan Mingyu, a famous explosives expert in Haodi Village, calmly laid landmines after the Chiang troops entered the village and opened fire, killing three Chiang soldiers and officers, including a platoon leader. On the 8th, more than 1,000 Chiang troops attempted to cross the Qinglong River from Shahe Town, but were blocked by the militia. They fled south for more than 20 li, changed their route to cross the river, and were again shot at across the river by more than 30 militia members from Qian'an. After a three-day stalemate, they had to retreat in frustration. The militia in the suburbs of Lulong, in cooperation with the Eighth Route Army, annihilated 170 Chiang troops near Wudaoying Honghuayu, captured 20 alive, and seized 2 light and heavy machine guns and more than 30 rifles, greatly inspiring the people in the Chiang-occupied areas. On September 22nd, when the Chiang troops invaded Huogezhuang, eight militia members used flexible sparrow warfare to repel a regiment of Chiang troops invading from Shimen, killing or wounding three of them. Later, they cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to attack the Chiang troops in Shimen, seizing two machine guns and eight rifles.
