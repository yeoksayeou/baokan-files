　　Record of a Meeting with Mr. Jing Song
    Ma Hanbing
    Yesterday (October 19th) marked the tenth anniversary of the death of cultural mentor Mr. Lu Xun.
    Two articles are specially published to commemorate Mr. Lu Xun.
    Twelve years ago, I met Mr. Lu Xun in Shanghai and discussed with him the direction of literary and artistic activities in Southeast Asia and the development of overseas Chinese literature and art. Ms. Xu Guangping was also present during the conversation. This was our first acquaintance. Later, I returned to Burma and started a "Tian Zhu Literary Monthly." Through her introduction, we received many manuscripts from domestic writers. Our correspondence was very close in 1936. She encouraged the overseas Chinese literary and art circles to study and write diligently. She constantly used various methods to help the publication of the Tian Zhu Literary Monthly and the activities of the Tian Zhu Literary Society in Burma and Malaya. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I gave up writing to join the army and returned to the motherland from overseas, joining the people's army. Due to being transferred in North and Central China, I never stayed in a fixed area, and due to environmental restrictions, we had almost no communication for nearly ten years and did not know each other's whereabouts.
    This year, after the ceasefire order, I worked in Hankou. Due to everything needing to be coordinated in Beijing and Shanghai, I went to Shanghai several times. Only after seeing Xia Yan and Mai Jin did I learn of her residence. One evening, General Wang Zhen, Colonel Xue Zizheng, Mai Jin, Zi Nian, and Xia Yan visited her together. Before leaving, Mai Jin asked the three of us wearing "tiger skins" to change clothes. I asked him why he wanted us to change. He said that the reactionary rulers' henchmen were all over her residence, monitoring her every move. Although the henchmen did not dare to make things difficult for us, they would harm her. I was silent, and a fire of anger burned in my heart. It is not surprising that a revolutionary, patriotic literary and art worker was arrested, tortured, and humiliated by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, but it is so sad and upsetting that, after the victory, on the land of the motherland, she is still threatened and oppressed by the rulers and is still at risk of being arrested and tortured again at any moment.
    Stepping into her small and simple house—a room of one square zhang in area, with a bed, a writing desk, and another dining table—the furnishings told me that this was her workroom, dining room, and bedroom. Except for cooking not being done in this room, she spent almost her entire day in this small house. The level of poverty can be imagined. When we went in, she was mending clothes. Haiying was lying on the table reading. Haiying had grown so tall that if she hadn't introduced him, I wouldn't have believed he was Mr. Lu Xun's son. We shook hands warmly, asking each other about the past ten years.
    When Mai Jin introduced General Wang Zhen to her, she was extremely happy and shook hands with General Wang again, saying, "I heard that you marched from Yan'an to Guangdong, fought all the way to Guangdong. Not only did we know this news, but all the citizens of Shanghai also knew about it. This feat brought joy to them."
    She was so enthusiastic and excited to have General Wang Zhen tell her the stories of the Southern Expedition. General Wang Zhen talked from the beginning of the expedition all the way to the meeting in the Central Plains. She listened so attentively, a joyful smile on the corner of her mouth. Sometimes, when General Wang Zhen told a story too simply and it couldn't satisfy her demands, she immediately questioned him, asking him to add more detailed descriptions. When she encountered a particularly interesting story, she asked him to pause for a moment and recorded it in her diary. She said that for several years she had always wanted to get some news from the liberated areas and stories of the people's army fighting the enemy, puppets, and stubborn elements, but the environment couldn't satisfy her. She could only get some intermittent news from foreign reporters. Even if someone came from the liberated areas and talked about it, there was never a time like this when General Wang Zhen, as someone who personally led a team and fought in the north and south, told her in such detail and with such flavor. She praised General Wang Zhen's speaking skills as being so vivid and interesting.
    She was very concerned about the liberated areas. She wanted to know all the stories of the liberated areas. She said that if it weren't for the existence of the liberated areas and the people's army, which gave the broad masses of the people a bright indicator and hope, people would have been suffocated by these gloomy days long ago, just like Mr. Lu Xun, she loved the people here in the liberated areas.
    I asked her how her current life was. She smiled bitterly and said, "I rely on some royalties from Mr. Lu Xun's works to make a living, but this is ultimately limited. Besides clothing, food, and housing, there are also Haiying's education expenses, so it is very difficult." She continued, "The wounds from being tortured by the Japanese puppets have not completely healed. When the weather changes, I still feel uncomfortable, but it's not a big problem."
    Haiying has grown as tall as me and is very handsome, just a little thin. He is very interested in physics, chemistry, and mathematics, and also likes to read some literary books. He is very diligent and rarely speaks. Besides reading, he stays at home with his beloved mother, which gives Ms. Guangping great comfort. She believes, and I also think so, that when he grows up, he will definitely not disgrace being the child of China's greatest literary giant, Mr. Lu Xun.
    When we said goodbye to her, she repeatedly asked us to greet all of Mr. Lu Xun's former friends in the liberated areas and to pay tribute to the heroic people's army defending the liberated areas and the brave and hardworking people! She said that she hoped to be able to visit the liberated areas one day, but the current environment did not allow her to do so.
    On May 23rd, I went to Shanghai again and visited her again. She no longer lived with Sister Liao and had moved to another place because of hiding from the surveillance of secret agents and reactionary thugs. In fact, as of now, she is still under the intimidation and threat of secret agents.

　　景宋先生会见记
    马寒冰
    昨日（十月十九日）为文化导师鲁迅先生忌辰十周年，
    特发表两篇有关追念先生的文章，以示纪念。
    十二年前，我曾经在上海会见过鲁迅先生，和他谈论着南洋文艺活动和南洋华侨文艺发展的方向。谈话的时候许广平先生也在座，这是我们初次的相识。以后我回到了缅甸，办了一个“天竹文艺月刊”，经过了她给我们介绍不少国内作家的稿子，我们之间的通信关系，在一九三六年中，差不多是非常密切的。她鼓励了华侨文艺界努力学习与写作，她不断地用各种方法，来帮助天竹文艺月刊的出版，和天竹文艺社在缅甸及马来亚的活动。抗战爆发后，我投笔从戎，从海外回到了祖国，参加了人民的军队，由于转载在华北和华中，从来没有在固定的地区滞留下来，以及环境的不许可，我们差不多将近十年，没有通信，也不知道彼此的消息。
    今年停战令后，我在汉口工作，由于一切事物，需要到京沪接洽，我到了上海几次，看见了夏衍和迈进，才知道了她的住处。一个晚上，王震将军，薛子正上校，迈进，梓年，夏衍联袂地去拜访了她。临走的时候，迈进要我们三个穿“老虎皮”的人，把衣服换换，我问他为什么要换，他说反动的统治者的爪牙，满布了她的住处附近，监视她的一切行动，我们又是中共方面的人物，虽然爪牙们还不敢难为我们，但却会害了她。我默然了，心里燃烧起愤怒之火，一个革命的，爱国的文艺工作者，在抗战中，曾经受到了敌人的拘捕和拷打、侮辱，那是不足为奇的，但在胜利之后，在祖国的大地上，仍然受到了统治者的威胁和压迫，仍然时刻地有遭受另一次的拘捕和拷打的危险，是多么使人悲愤和难受呵。
    踏进了她那狭小而又简朴的房子——一间一方丈面积的房子，摆了一个床，一张写字台和另一张饭桌，从这陈设中告诉我，这是他的工作间，饭厅和寝室，除了烧饭不在这个房子以外，她差不多就在这狭小的房子，度过了她整天的生活，寒酸程度也可以想见了。走进去的时候，她正在缝补衣服，海婴伏在案上读书，海婴是长得那么高大，如果不是她的介绍我简直不敢相信是他——鲁迅先生的公子。我们彼此很亲热的握手，彼此询问着十年来的生活。
    当迈进给她介绍王震将军的时候，她高兴极了，再一次地和王将军握手说：“我听说你从延安走到广东，打到广东，不但我们知道这消息，全上海的市民也都知道了，这壮举，你给他们带来了喜悦。”
    她是那末热情，那么兴奋地要王震将军告诉她南征的故事，王震将军从出发起一直谈到了会师中原，她是那么注意地听着。嘴角上露出喜悦的微笑。有些时候，王震将军把某一个故事，讲得太简单了，不能满足她的要求，她立即追问着他，要他加以更细的描绘。遇到了极有味道的故事，她要他稍停一下，用笔记在她的日记册上。她说几年来总想得到一些解放区的消息，和人民军队和敌伪顽战斗的故事，但是环境不能满足她，仅能从外国记者所报导的一些断续的消息。即使有人从解放区来，也谈了一些，但总没有一次像王震将军这样以一个亲身领导一支队伍，转战南北的人，给她讲得这末详细和有味道，她赞扬着王震将军的讲话本领，是那么生动和有趣。
    她非常关怀着解放区，她愿意知道解放区一切的故事，她说要不是解放区和人民军队的存在，给予广大人民一种光明的指标和希望，人们早已被这阴沉的日子，窒息得喘不过气了，一如鲁迅先生，她热爱解放区这里的人民。
    我问她目前的生活怎样，她苦笑说：“就是靠鲁迅先生一些版税过日子，但这究意是有限的，除了要穿衣，吃饭，住房子，还有海婴的教育费，也就很困难了。”她接着说：“被日伪所拷打的创伤还没有完全好，天一变了，还有些不舒服，但也无大妨碍。”
    海婴已经长大得有我一样高了，生的非常英俊，就是稍为瘦一些，他对理化和数学颇感兴趣，也喜欢读些文艺书。他非常用功，很少讲话，除了读书以外，就在家里陪着他所热爱的妈妈，这给广平先生一个极大的安慰。她相信，我也如此想法，他完全长大之后，决不辱没了是中国最伟大的文豪鲁迅先生的孩子。
    当我们向她告别的时候，她一再嘱咐我们，问候在解放区一切和鲁迅先生昔日的朋友，向英勇保卫解放区的人民军队，和英勇而勤劳的人民致敬！她说希望有一天能够到解放区来看看，但目前的环境还不许她如此做法。
    五月二十三日，我又再度去上海，又去看她，她已经不和廖大姐住在一起，另外搬到一个地方去，原因是躲避特务和反动派的走狗们的监视，事实，截至目前，她仍然是处于特务的恐吓与威胁之下。
    一九四六年八月廿六日
