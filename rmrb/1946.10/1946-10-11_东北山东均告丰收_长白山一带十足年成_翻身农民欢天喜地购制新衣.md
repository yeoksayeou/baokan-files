Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, 5th: The counties of Tonghua, Linjiang, Fusong, Jingzhai (belonging to Mengjiang County), and Ji'an in the Changbai Mountain area have all had abundant harvests. The main crops in the area, corn and sorghum, yield an average of 300 to 500 catties per mu. Mountainous and low-lying areas also yield more than 200 catties per mu. Soybeans yield an average of 130 catties per mu. Because the peasants received widespread relief from the democratic government during the spring famine this year, and then implemented the "land to the tiller" policy, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. This summer there was a drought, but they overcame the natural disaster by irrigating day and night, resulting in a good harvest. Harvesting has now begun in various places, and the poor peasants who used to worry about getting through the winter are now buying cloth to make new clothes.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 8th: In the Shandong Liberated Area, except for some low-lying plains that were flooded due to rain, most areas have reported a bumper autumn harvest. Sorghum and millet have now been harvested and stored in warehouses, and peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, etc., have also entered the market. The output in various places has exceeded that of previous years. Deng Xinzhuang, a labor hero from Ju County, harvested 80,000 catties of sorghum from his village's four qing of sorghum land, a threefold increase over last year. Shiquanhu Village's 114 mu of spring fields yielded an increase of 8,500 catties, and the village's 32 households have averaged "cultivating three and having one to spare". In the Tai'an Laiwu Plain, each large mu (960 steps) produced an average of 1,600 catties of early millet, a universal doubling. Zhao@ (Xin County, formerly northern Pi County) harvested 450 catties of sorghum per mu, an increase of 40 catties. In the Weihai area of Jiaodong, sorghum and millet yields have increased by 36 catties per mu, and cotton has begun to enter the market. The best yields are 50 catties of ginned cotton per mu.
