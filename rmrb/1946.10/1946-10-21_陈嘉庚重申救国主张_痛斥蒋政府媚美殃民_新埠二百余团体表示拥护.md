　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. Singapore dispatch: After overseas Chinese leader Mr. Chen Jiageng, representing ten million overseas Chinese, sent a telegram to Truman on September 10th requesting the immediate withdrawal of American troops stationed in China and the cessation of all aid to the Kuomintang government, the traitorous and pro-American Chiang Kai-shek immediately directed his pet Central News Agency and several government-run newspapers in Malaya to attack Mr. Chen. Two hundred and sixteen overseas Chinese organizations in Singapore held a representative conference on September 27th, unanimously expressing their determination to fully support Mr. Chen's telegram, providing a forceful counterattack to the Kuomintang authorities. The day before the conference (September 26th), when Mr. Chen Jiageng received a reporter from the Central News Agency, he severely refuted the agency's and the Kuomintang's government-controlled newspapers' rumors and slanders, and reiterated the contents of his telegram: (1) Premier Sun advocated democracy, and the actions of the Japanese imperialist organs and their running dog warlords in opposing Premier Sun are exactly the same. (2) Commander-in-chief Chiang has been in power for twenty years. During these twenty years, political corruption and the harm caused to the people by corrupt officials have been appalling and obvious to all. (3) As of today, the United States should no longer have land, sea, or air forces stationed in our country, because our country is not a colony, nor is it the Philippines. Therefore, I called in the telegram for the withdrawal of American troops from China. (4) I myself have been to Yan'an and firmly believe that Yan'an is not practicing communism, but is practicing the Three Principles of the People and implementing democracy, and it is now deeply rooted. The Communist Party now occupies a large territory, and its army is too numerous to count, making it absolutely impossible to eliminate. Therefore, I emphasized in the telegram that the issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be resolved peacefully. (5) Finally, I appealed in the telegram to the United States to absolutely not provide the government army with more military supplies to fuel the civil war, because what the United States is doing today is no different from the past Japanese imperialism. Mr. Chen stated: "People in Singapore should know that since the July 7th Incident, my proposals and speeches have been repeatedly attacked. For example, last time I sent a telegram opposing Wang Jingwei, requesting Commander-in-chief Chiang to issue an order to arrest the traitor Wang and expel him from the party, but some people in the Kuomintang also opposed it. However, I have always acted according to my conscience and have not stopped doing things because of opposition and attacks. Otherwise, I would have lost my integrity today."

　　陈嘉庚重申救国主张
    痛斥蒋政府媚美殃民
    新埠二百余团体表示拥护
    【新华社延安十八日电】新加坡航讯：侨胞领袖陈嘉庚氏代表一千万华侨，于九月十日致电杜鲁门要求立即撤退驻华美军并停止对国民党政府的一切援助后，卖国媚美的蒋介石即指挥其御用的中央社及马来亚若干官办报纸攻击陈氏。新加坡二百十六个侨团特于九月二十七日举行代表大会，一致表示决以全力拥护陈氏通电，予国民党当局以有力反击。大会前一日（二十六日）陈嘉庚氏于接见中央社记者时对该社及国民党御用报纸之造谣诬蔑曾痛加驳斥，并重申其通电内容：（一）孙总理倡行民主，而日寇御用机关及其走狗军阀反对孙总理之举，正与之同出一辙。（二）蒋委员长执政二十年，此二十年中政治腐败，贪官污吏害民至惨，有目共睹。（三）时至今日，美国实不应再有海陆空军驻于我国，盖我国非殖民地，非菲律滨也，故余于电文中吁请美军撤离中国。（四）余本身曾到过延安，深信延安并非实行共产主义，而是奉行三民主义实行民主，且今日已根深蒂固。共产党现占地盘甚大，军队亦不可胜数，绝对不易消灭。故余电中强调国共两党问题和平解决。（五）余于电文中最后吁请美国切不能再供给政府军火物资以助长内战，盖美国今日所为，已与过去之日本帝国主义无异。陈氏表示：“新加坡人士当知自七七事变以后，余之主张言论迭次遭人攻击，例如前次余通电反对汪精卫，请蒋委员长明令通缉汪逆及开除其党籍，国民党中亦有人反对。然一向做事均凭良心，并不因遭人反对攻击而停手不做，否则余今日已失人格矣。
