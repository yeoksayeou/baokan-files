　　After Five Years of Mass Movement Production
    The Entire Zhongxiang Village is Happy
    Cultivated Land Expanded by 40 Percent, Mules and Cattle Increased Five to Ten Times
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Yangcheng, 14th] Over the past five years, the peasants of Shimin Zhongxiang Village, after several rent and interest reduction, anti-corruption, anti-local tyrant, and general liquidation movements, have realized "land to the tiller." Farmers have organized themselves and launched a large-scale production campaign, giving the entire village a new look. Poverty and hunger are a thing of the past, and all 38 extremely poor households have been eliminated. After acquiring land, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has soared to unprecedented levels. They are now fully engaged in developing wasteland, building houses, and creating happy families. In 1941, the village's cultivated land area was only 2,008 mu, but it has now increased to 2,887 mu (an increase of over 40 percent). The number of houses has increased from the original 368 to the current 488 (an increase of 30 percent). Cave dwellings have increased from 103 to 156 (an increase of 50 percent). The number of cattle has increased from 28 to 192, and the number of mules has increased from 10 to 53. Currently, the majority of men, women, young, and old in the village have joined mutual aid teams and organized turn-over cooperatives. The number of women involved in textile production has grown to 205. Before the war, the village relied entirely on foreign merchants for cotton cloth, but it has now gradually achieved self-sufficiency in both cultivation and supply. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, all the pigs, sheep, chickens, and dogs in the village were killed and plundered by the Japanese invaders. Now, 380 chickens, 5 pigs, and 400 sheep have been raised again. The farmers' lives have greatly improved, and they are now further refining their farming techniques and developing sideline occupations. The entire village is showing a thriving new atmosphere.
