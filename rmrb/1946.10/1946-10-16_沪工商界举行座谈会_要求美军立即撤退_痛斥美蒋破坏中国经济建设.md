Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Shanghai dispatch: On the sixth day of the "U.S. Troops Out of China Week" movement initiated by ten Shanghai people's organizations (September 28th), a symposium was held for industrial and commercial circles. Chairman Zhang Wangbo reported on the situation in various sectors during the six days of the movement, followed by a discussion. The meeting solemnly pointed out that there is no freedom in China today, only three major freedoms: 1. Freedom of feudal usury. 2. Freedom of corruption and exploitation by corrupt officials. 3. Freedom of aggression by U.S. imperialism. Today, the industrial and commercial circles in China are not only not assisted by the government, but also face increased tax rates. Only usurers can receive government protection without paying any taxes. The meeting unanimously stated that the civil war will not stop, inflation will not cease, and rising prices will have no end. It pointed out that the government spends 34 million yuan per month on the army and 14 million yuan on the navy for the civil war, requiring a monthly military expenditure of 48 million yuan. Under the U.S. military's aid policy to China, it not only fuels the civil war and undermines China's national economy, but also engages in large-scale smuggling. The government recently purchased 890 million yuan worth of U.S. wartime surplus materials. As a result, American goods flood the market, including food from 1944 that is now rotten. The people have the right to demand that the government disclose the contents of all these materials. Attendees unanimously demanded the freezing of these materials. After a report by businesswoman Ms. Hu Ziying on the grand occasion of the "Get Out of China Movement" rallies held on the 27th by the Chongqing People's Promotion Association, more than 200 overseas Chinese groups in Singapore, and the American Committee for Peace, the meeting unanimously resolved to maintain close contact with domestic and foreign groups and passed the following resolutions: 1. Demand the speedy withdrawal of U.S. troops from China until the goal is achieved; 2. Stop the civil war immediately; 3. Freeze surplus materials; 4. Oppose the U.S. economic aggression policy and welcome legitimate Sino-U.S. industrial and commercial cooperation; 5. Overthrow the new Chinese traitors who disregard national interests and collude with U.S. reactionaries; 6. Overthrow bureaucratic capital and comprador capital. Finally, Zang Chenghai, the younger brother of Zang Da'erzi, a rickshaw puller killed by U.S. soldiers, reported on the tragic death of his brother. He expressed his determination to avenge his brother's wrongful death and demanded compensation. He filed a lawsuit with the local court on the 25th, but has yet to receive a response. The assembly immediately passed a resolution to organize the "Zang Da'erzi Tragic Death Case Support Association," to pursue legal action and raise funds from the public, entrusting the United Evening News and Wenhui Daily to collect the funds and announce the progress daily.

　　沪工商界举行座谈会
    要求美军立即撤退
    痛斥美蒋破坏中国经济建设
    【新华社延安十二日电】沪讯：上海十个人民团体发起之响应“美军退出中国周”运动第六日（上月二十八日），曾招待工商界，举行座谈。主席张网伯氏报告六天以来运动中各界情况后，旋即展开讨论。会中沉痛指斥今日中国别无自由，只有三大自由：一、封建高利贷自由。二、贪官污吏盗窃剥削自由。三、美帝国主义侵略自由。今天中国的工商界，政府不但不予以协助，且在增加税率，唯有高利贷者能受政府保护，而不缴纳任何捐税。会中一致表示内战不停，通货膨胀不休，物价高涨绝无止境，并指出政府为从事内战，陆军每月开支三千四百万万元，海军一千四百万万元，按月军费须开支四千八百万万元。而美军驻华片面援助政策下，不仅助长内战，破坏中国国民经济，并且大事走私，政府近购进价值八万万九千万元之美国战时剩余物资，故美货排山倒海充斥市场，其中所有一九四四年之食物，今已腐烂不堪，其全部物资究为何物，人民亦当有权要求政府公布。与会人士一致要求冻结该项物资。在由实业家胡子婴女士报告渝人民促进会、新加坡华侨二百余团体及美国争取和平委员会均于二十七日举行退出中国运动大会之盛况后，会议一致决议与国内外各团体采取密切联系，并通过：一、要求美军迅速退出中国，誓必达到目的为止；二、立即停止内战；三、冻结剩余物资；四、反对美国经济侵华政策，欢迎中美工商业正当合作；五、打倒不顾民族利益、勾结美国反动派之新汉奸；六、打倒官僚资本买办资本。最后，由为美军打死之洋车夫臧大二子之胞弟臧成海报告其兄惨死经过，他表示要为其胞兄之冤死报仇，要求偿命，曾于二十五日向地方法院投状，但至今未见下文。大会当即通过组织“臧大二子惨死案后援会”，一面提出法律诉讼，一面向社会募款，委托联合晚报文汇报代行收款，并逐日宣布。
