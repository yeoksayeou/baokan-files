　　Investing in Industry and Commerce is More Profitable than Renting Land
    Landlords in Jin Sui Turn to Other Professions
    Mr. Wang Xiu Switches to Industry and Commerce and Pays Off Old Debts
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 15th】The private textile factory, Weifen Textile Factory, initiated and funded by Mr. Niu Youlan, a well-known Jin Sui gentry and member of the Border Region Senate, is about to start operations. The factory's capital is over 60 million agricultural currency units, and most of the shareholders are landlords and rich peasants. Mr. Wang Xiu, a landlord in the second district of Xing County, owed more than a thousand silver dollars in the old regime. After the establishment of the new regime in 1943, he sold his land and mostly invested in industry and commerce. In the past three years, not only has he paid off his debts, but he has also redeemed his old house. He said, "Under the new regime, if you have money, you should engage in production on a large scale." Therefore, when Weifen Textile Factory was established, he invested 4 million yuan. Niu Housheng, a landlord who was unwilling to invest in production in the past, also invested 2.5 million yuan. Landlord Wang Li'er sold his real estate and requested to invest. Currently, the factory's private capital is still expanding.

　　投资工商比出租地更有利
    晋绥地主纷纷转业
    王秀先生转向工商业还清旧债
    【新华社兴县十五日电】晋绥知名士绅，边区参议员牛友兰先生所发起集资创办之私营纺织工厂——蔚汾纺织厂，日内即将开工，该厂资本农币六千万元以上，股东大部为地主富农。兴县二区地主王秀先生在旧政权时欠债白洋千余元，四三年新政权建立后，即将土地出卖，大部转入工商业，三年来，不但欠债还清，并赎回了旧房屋。他说：“在新政权下，手里有钱要大大的闹生产。”因此在创立蔚汾纺织厂时，他即投资四百万元，过去不愿投资生产的地主牛厚生，亦投资二百五十万元，地主王立儿将地产出卖，要求投资。现该厂私人资本仍在扩大中。
