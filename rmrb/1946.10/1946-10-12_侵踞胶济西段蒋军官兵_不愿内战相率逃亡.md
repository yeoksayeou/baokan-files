Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 9th. Chiang Kai-shek's 96th Army, which is occupying the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, was reorganized from He Zhuguo's Northeast Army. The Northeast officers and soldiers of this army and the conscripted laborers from Hunan all deeply feel that there is no future in fighting a civil war and are eager to return home, constantly fleeing to the Liberated Areas. According to soldiers of this army who escaped from Zhangqiu, the internal factions within the army are complex and there are many contradictions. First, there is friction between Chiang Kai-shek's direct line and miscellaneous troops. Company-level officers and adjutants mostly belong to Zhang Xueliang's old troops, while platoon and squad leaders are mostly from the "Sino-American Cooperation Institute." They are proud of being trained by the United States and able to use American equipment, and regard Northeast officers as "old warlords" and "old minds," and bear the special task of monitoring the thoughts and actions of Northeast adjutants. Secondly, there is opposition between officers and soldiers. Chiang Kai-shek's direct line officers indulge in extravagance, feasting, drinking, and gambling, while ordinary soldiers eat sweet potatoes and wear shorts, and their salaries are deducted at every level, and they are often beaten and scolded. Thirdly, there is discrimination between outsiders and locals. Many of the soldiers in this army were puppet soldiers who fled to Jinan after the Japanese surrendered, and those who were "beautified" scolded them as "traitor legs," while they retorted that the "beautified" were no better than those who laughed at the pot calling the kettle black.

　　侵踞胶济西段蒋军官兵
    不愿内战相率逃亡
    【新华社临沂九日电】侵踞胶济路西段之蒋军九十六军，系由东北军何柱国部改编，该军东北籍官兵及由湖南抓来的壮丁，都深感打内战无前途，思乡心切，不断相率逃来解放区。据自章邱逃出之该军士兵称：该军内部派系庞杂，矛盾很多。首为蒋嫡系与杂牌系的磨擦，连级官佐多属张学良旧部，而班排长则多出身“中美合作所”，他们骄傲自己受过美国训练，会使用美械装备，而视东北籍军官为“老军阀”“旧脑筋”，并负有监视东北籍军佐思想行动之特殊任务。其次为官兵之间的对立，蒋嫡系军官花天酒地，吃喝嫖赌，而一般士兵则啃地瓜、穿短裤，粮饷被层层克扣，且时遭打骂。第三为外籍与地方间之歧视。该军士兵有不少系于日寇投降后逃入济南的伪军，经“美化”者骂他们为“汉奸腿子”，他们反讥“美化”者不过五十步笑百步而已。
