　　People of Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Linfen and Fushan Once Again Surge to the Front Lines
    Bravely Rescuing the Wounded Under Fire
    Protecting Fushan City, Tens of Thousands of Militiamen Cooperate with the Main Force to Annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek-Puppet Labor-Military Integrated Organizations, Participating in the War Without Delaying Production
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, first day report] When Hu Zongnan's First Division advanced towards Fushan, approaching Hongdong, the people of Hongdong once again mobilized fully, giving their full support to the front lines. Five hundred stretchers immediately followed the attacking troops to Guanque and Chenyan in Linfen. Following this, stretcher teams from Linfen, Fushan, and Zhaocheng rushed to the front lines from hundreds of miles away, risking their lives under intense artillery fire to carry down the wounded. In Guanque, some stretchers were broken by shells; in Chenyan, several stretcher bearers were wounded, but they disregarded their own pain and still tried to quickly transport the wounded. ×× Village is a transfer station, and the entire village enthusiastically received the wounded, giving up their houses and kangs for the wounded to stay in. During the transfer, men, women, old and young all participated in the transportation work. Elder Su Wenkui is already sixty-two years old, but he firmly demanded to participate in the transport. He said, "Our people are wounded for us, shouldn't we carry them?" Many of the wounded were moved to tears by this. Tens of thousands of militiamen fighting with the troops on various fronts followed the troops on their attacks, surrounding the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Chenyan and Guanque, and defending Fushan City. They also helped the stretcher teams rescue the wounded under fire. They said, "We are not afraid of bullets flying over our heads, we are only afraid of the wounded being left on the firing line." The people in the rear were busy day and night with various logistical tasks. During this tense harvest season, they arranged their lives well, ensuring that both war and production were not delayed. Yin Biyuan of Shucun, Cao Sheng and other villages shouted the slogan: "Men go to the front to fight hard, women stay in the rear to not delay production." Shucun and others organized labor-military integration and mutual aid, formulating work exchange methods, and participating in the war also counted as work. They organized all sixty-two cattle in the village into mutual aid teams, and even organized the semi-labor force. They have now plowed all the wheat fields in the village once. In the villages at the front, women take on various village duties. They act as village chiefs, financial and food managers, and logistics personnel, allowing every man capable of fighting to go to the front.

　　洪赵临浮人民再次涌上前线
    炮火下奋勇救伤员
    保卫浮山城数万民兵配合主力歼灭蒋伪劳武结合组织参战不误生产
    【本报阳城一日电】胡宗南第一师向浮山进犯，逼近洪洞的时候，洪洞的老百姓又一次总动员起来，用全力支援前线。五百付担架立即随着出击的部队到达临汾的官雀、陈堰；接着又有临汾、浮山、赵城各地的担架队从百里地外赶到前线，在猛烈的炮火下，冒死运下彩号。在官雀有些担架被炮弹打折了；在陈堰几个担架队员被打伤了，但他们却不顾自己的伤痛，仍设法迅速地运下彩号。××村是转运站，全村老百姓兴奋的接待彩号，让出自己的屋子和炕给彩号住。转运时，男女老少都投入了转运工作。苏文奎老汉已经六十二岁了，他坚决要求参加运送。他说：“咱的人为咱挂彩，还不该担送？”许多彩号因此感动得流下泪来。与部队在各个战线上作战的数万民兵，跟着部队出击，到陈堰、官雀包围蒋伪军，保卫浮山城。并帮助担架队在炮火下抢救彩号。他们说：“不怕子弹在头上飞过，就怕彩号留在火线上。”后方的人们为各种后勤工作日晚忙碌着，在这紧张的收秋时节，他们很好的安排了自己的生活，使战争生产两不耽误，蜀村尹壁原上、曹生等村喊出：“男人上前方努力打仗，女人在后方不误生产”的口号。蜀村等组织劳武结合大互助，订出变工办法，参战也顶工。把全村六十二个牛组织成互助队，半劳力也组织起来，现已把全村麦地耙过一遍。在前方的村子里，女人担任村里的各种工作。她们代理村长、财粮、后勤，让每个能参战的男人都到前方去。
