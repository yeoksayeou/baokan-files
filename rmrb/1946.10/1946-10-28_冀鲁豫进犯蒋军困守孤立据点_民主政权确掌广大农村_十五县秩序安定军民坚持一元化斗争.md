[Our newspaper Jiluyu, 26th dispatch] In the Jiluyu region occupied by Chiang's troops, in the area north of the Longhai Railway, south of the Heze-Jining Road, east of the Dongming-Kaocheng Road, and west of Weishan Lake, Chiang's troops only occupy fifteen isolated county towns. The vast liberated areas of these fifteen counties stand firm as a mountain. The democratic government continues to implement administrative orders, organize the masses to resist the attacks of Chiang's troops, crack down on the "home-returning teams," and persist in the unified struggle. When the puppet army of Wu Huawen invaded Jining in late September, the Jining Municipal Government immediately led the city's Public Security Brigade and more than 2,000 militiamen to safely evacuate citizens to outside the city. It also established the Grand Canal Detachment, with Mayor Ma Jikong as the commander, to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army in continuing activities in the suburbs. They repeatedly defeated the "home-returning teams" attempting to establish Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime in the countryside, and once raided the East and South Gates of Jining City, eliminating more than 300 Chiang's puppet troops, leaving Chiang's troops trapped in the city. The democratic government in the suburbs and surrounding villages remains standing still. After Chiang's troops occupied Heze, the Heze Municipal Government also led the city's Public Security Brigade and militia to continue activities in the north of the city. In the second half of September alone, they repelled nearly ten incursions by Chiang's troops and "home-returning teams," preventing the "home-returning teams" from easily coming out again, and thwarting Chiang's troops' attempt to establish district and village public offices. The Qibin County (newly established county between Cao County and Kaocheng) county government, during the second northward invasion by Chiang's troops, led the county brigade and militia battalion, cooperating with local military forces, deep into the rear of the invading Chiang's troops, actively operating in the southern part of the county. Currently, there is no trace of Chiang's troops in the entire county, and the decrees of the democratic government reach the cities occupied by Chiang. The democratic government is comforting and providing relief to the most severely affected villages, and sheltering refugees. After the county seat of Dongming County was occupied, the Dongming County Government led the militia battalion to actively operate outside the city. In late September, they successively eliminated three "home-returning corps" of Chiang's troops, and destroyed one stubborn district public office, compressing Chiang's troops into several independent strongholds on the Donghe and Dongkao highways. In addition, the Dangshan and Peitong county governments also led the militia, each eliminating one stubborn district public office and resolving many "home-returning corps" incidents. Currently, the broad masses of the twenty-four counties are carrying forward the experience of guerrilla warfare during the eight-year War of Resistance, actively cooperating with the main forces, organizing the masses, leading the militia to stabilize order, and resisting all the intrusions of Chiang's troops.

　　冀鲁豫进犯蒋军困守孤立据点
    民主政权确掌广大农村
    十五县秩序安定军民坚持一元化斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】在冀鲁豫的蒋军侵占区，在陇海路以北、荷（泽）济（宁）路以南、东（明）考（城）路以东、微山湖以西的地区中，蒋军仅占领十五座孤立县城，十五县的广大解放区屹立如山。民主政权继续推行政令，组织群众抵抗蒋军的进攻，打击还乡队，坚持一元化斗争。当伪军吴化文部于上月下旬侵占济宁时，济宁市政府即领导市公安大队及全市民兵二千余人，掩护市民安全撤到城外，并成立运河支队，由马继孔市长任司令员，配合八路军在城郊继续活动，几次击溃企图下乡建立蒋介石伪政权的“还乡队”，并曾一度袭入济宁市东关及南关，消灭蒋伪三百余名，使蒋军困守城内，城郊及四乡民主政权依然屹立不动。在蒋军侵占荷泽后，荷泽市政府亦率领市公安大队及民兵，继续在城北活动，仅九月下半月内，即击退蒋军及“还乡队”近十次的出犯，使“还乡队”不敢再轻易出来，粉碎蒋军建立区村公所的企图，齐滨县（新设县，在曹县考城间）县政府则在蒋军二次北犯时，率领县大队及民兵营，配合地方兵团深入到进犯蒋军的后方去，在该县南部积极活动。现该县全境已无蒋军踪迹，民主政府法令达于被蒋侵占的城市，民主政府正在安抚与救济受害最重的村庄，收容难民。东明县政府于县城被占后，遂率领民兵营，在城外积极活动，于九月下旬内，先后消灭蒋军“还乡团”三个，打垮顽区公所一处，把蒋军压缩到东荷、东考两公路线上的几个独立据点内。此外，砀山、沛铜两县府亦曾领导民兵，各消灭顽区公所一处，解决“还乡团”多起。现在二十四县的广大人民正在发扬着八年抗战期间游击战争的经验，积极配合主力，组织群众，领导民兵安定秩序，抵抗蒋军的一切侵扰。
