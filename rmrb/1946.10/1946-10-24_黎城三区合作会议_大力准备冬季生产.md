　　Licheng Third District Cooperation Conference
    Vigorously Prepare for Winter Production
    [Report from our Licheng office] The Third District of this county convened a joint meeting of cooperative directors from twenty-five villages to prepare for winter production. According to reports from various cooperatives, the district's twenty-five villages currently have 2,243 spinning wheels, 187 hand tractors, 138 indigenous looms, and 2 iron looms. However, there are only 6 cotton gins and 8 cotton gins, which cannot meet the needs of the textile industry. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly organize the masses to raise shares to buy more. The Donghuangxu and Dongyangguan Xicun cooperatives are organizing the masses to open brick and tile kilns in their villages to actively solve the housing difficulties of the masses. Changyuan Village has a lot of land but lacks fertilizer. The cooperative has organized a flour mill to solve the fertilizer problem. The masses in Zaopan need transportation, and the cooperative is preparing to organize a transportation team and invest in the masses. Xiawan Village is suitably located on a main road, and the cooperative has lent capital to the masses to open shops. The entire district has also organized 12 oil mills, 7 transportation teams, 15 transportation groups, and 1 saltpeter workshop. The meeting believed that these will play a significant role in winter production. However, it is still far from meeting actual needs, and it is necessary to continue to vigorously organize the masses and make preparations more adequate and widespread, until all the masses can be organized.

　　黎城三区合作会议
    大力准备冬季生产
    【本报黎城讯】本县三区召开二十五村合作社主任联席会准备冬季生产。据各社汇报，全区二十五村现有纺车二千二百四十三辆，手拉机一百八十七架，土机一百三十八架，铁机二架，但只有弹花机六辆与轧花机八辆，供不上纺织需要，故须赶快组织群众集股去买。东黄须、东阳关西村合作社正组织群众在本村开设砖瓦窑，积极解决群众修盖房屋的困难。长垣村地多肥料缺，合作社组织了一座粉房以解决肥料问题。枣畔群众要求运输，合作社正准备组织运输队，并投资给群众。下湾村适当大路，合作社借了本钱给群众开店。全区并已组织起油房十二座，运输队七个，运输组十五个，硝坊一座。会议认为，这些都将在冬季生产中起重大作用。但离实际需要还很远，必须继续大力组织群众，把准备工作做得更充分，更普遍。一直到能把所有群众都组织起来。
