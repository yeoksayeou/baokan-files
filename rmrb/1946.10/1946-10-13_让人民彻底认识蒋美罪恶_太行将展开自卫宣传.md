    【This newspaper Changzhi 11th dispatch】The Taihang Administrative Office recently issued a notice to all cities, counties, and schools to widely launch self-defense propaganda, so that the people can further understand the essence of Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists and the treasonous civil war they launched, explain the war situation at any time, publicize our army's victories, enhance the people's fighting spirit, and strengthen their confidence in victory: 1. In addition to conducting propaganda, local people's education centers and schools at all levels should regularly explain current affairs to the masses (which can be combined with winter schools), improve mass blackboards, and publish more popular forms (such as clapper talks) of current affairs explanations. Cities should set up more of these blackboards. 2. Strengthen blind story-singing propaganda teams, provide them with materials, and encourage creation. Areas that have not yet organized story-singing teams should organize them immediately. 3. Widely carry out theater activities and creation movements, mobilize teachers and students of various schools and theater troupes, and mobilize together to carry out this work.

    太行将展开自卫宣传
    【本报长治十一日电】太行行署顷通令各市、县及各学校广泛展开自卫宣传，使人民进一步认识蒋介石与美帝国主义者及其所发动的卖国内战的本质，随时讲解战局，宣传我军捷报，提高人民斗志，加强必胜信念：一、各地民教馆各级学校除举办宣传外，应定期向群众讲解时事（可结合冬学）改进大众黑板报，多刊登通俗形式（如快板）之时事讲解，城市更应多设此种黑板报。二、加强盲人鼓书宣传队，供给他们材料，鼓励创作，未组织鼓书队的地区应即组织。三、广泛开展剧运与创作运动，发动各校师生、剧团，一齐动员起来进行这一工作。
