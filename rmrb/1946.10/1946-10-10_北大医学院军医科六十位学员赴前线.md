Sixty Students from Peking University Medical School's Military Medical Department Go to the Front Lines
[This newspaper's Peking University News] The entire class of the Military Medical Department of Peking University Medical School—sixty warriors on the medical front (not counting the two batches that have already departed)—led by comrades Zhang Xitian and Zhao Yinyuan, rushed to the front lines to serve at a time when the reactionaries were frantically attacking our Jilu豫 [Hebei-Shandong-Henan] area and our self-defense counterattack was very tense. These sixty students were originally medical personnel in the troops. After the Political Consultative Conference, they left the troops to pursue advanced studies at Peking University Medical School to serve the new China of peace and democracy. But the reactionaries have launched a large-scale attack on the liberated areas again, and although they are still studying, they immediately responded to the call to "go to the front lines for internship." Even students who were just recovering from serious illnesses and those with sores were determined to go, and they prepared their luggage in one day and rushed to the front lines.

　　北大医学院军医科六十位学员赴前线
    【本报北大讯】北大医学院军医科全体同学——六十名医务战线的勇士（前已出发两批未计在内），在反动派疯狂向我冀鲁豫区进攻，我自卫反击战正十分紧张的时候，由张希天、赵银元同志率领，驰赴前线服务。这六十位同学原都是部队的医务人员，在政协会后他们脱离部队到北大医学院深造，为和平民主的新中国服务。但反动派又向解放区大举进攻了，他们虽然是正在学习中，马上就响应“到前线去实习”的号召。大病初愈及生疮的同学也均决心前往，在一天内即整好行装，驰赴前线。       （润苍）
