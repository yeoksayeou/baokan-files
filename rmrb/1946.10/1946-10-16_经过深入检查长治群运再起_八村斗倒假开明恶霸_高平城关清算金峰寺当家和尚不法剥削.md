　　【Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 14th Dispatch】 After thorough inspection and mobilization, the mass movement in Changzhi has risen again. More than 300 debtors in eight villages, including Xiaoxinzhuang, Lujiazhuang, Shijiazhuang, and Chenzhuang in Lucheng, have re-ignited the liquidation struggle against Liang Weihan's usurious exploitation in Xiaoxinzhuang. Liang, nicknamed "Big Hemp Tree," is a notorious local tyrant who cruelly exploited and blackmailed peasants through usury. Especially during the famine in 1943, he made a fortune from the disaster by lending grain at exorbitant interest rates, charging five dou of interest for every shi of grain in just two months. His more than 400 mu of good land and twelve head of livestock were all plundered from peasants in the surrounding eight villages. This time, most of the 300-plus debtors struggling against him were victims of his exploitation. During the mass movement this spring, Liang, fearing that the masses would settle accounts with him, intimidated the peasants, spread rumors, and suppressed them, forbidding them from reducing future debts or refunding past ones. At the same time, he took out 50 mu of land he had seized to ease the struggle, pretending to be enlightened and distributing it to poor peasants. Because the leadership at the time failed to boldly support the masses and did not form a united struggle, the masses in the eight villages did not turn over. After a recent inspection, peasants in each village urgently demanded to settle accounts with him, so the district cadres mobilized the masses in the eight villages to widely deliberate. In late September, debtors from each village gathered in Xiaoxinzhuang to hold a meeting to pour out their grievances. More than 300 people tearfully recounted hundreds of instances of being霸地霸产 (bà dì bà chǎn, basically meaning a person who bullies and takes other's land and properties), deducting wages for serving the enemy, and other injustices perpetrated by Liang. Under the questioning of the debtors, Liang was left speechless, lowered his head and admitted his mistakes, and was willing to compensate the masses for all their losses. The debtors from the eight villages immediately established a joint liquidation committee to conduct accounting. The peasants said happily, "Cutting down this 'Big Hemp Tree' is like seeing the clear sky."
    【Our Newspaper, Yangcheng, 14th Dispatch】The struggle of the masses in Gaoping Chengguan to liquidate the illegal landlord—the abbot of Jinfeng Temple—has ended victoriously. At the liquidation meeting, He Baoze, an old man in his eighties, complained, "I worked as a farmhand for your Jinfeng Temple all my life, and my children also worked as farmhands for you. Who knew that after I spent all my strength, I would face death and now you have driven me out of the temple gate, forcing me to beg for food every day. Is this what people who chant Buddhist scriptures do?" Tenant Ma Shiqing said, "I used to rent five mu of bad land from you, and I harvested more than five shi of coarse grain every year. You charged me eight dou of rent per mu, totaling four shi. With the remaining one shi plus, just plowing the land cost six or seven dou. Adding hoeing, weeding, and fertilizing, it wasn't even enough to cover the costs. I worked hard for a year and couldn't even get a bowl of thin porridge!" Ma Shiqing burst into tears as he spoke. Several women said, "In the past, when we prayed for children, the monks said: Give our master more donations, and we guarantee you'll have a child. Big money brings boys, small money brings girls, and 皮钱 (pí qián, literally "skin money" meaning very little money) brings blind children." Shen Jiuer pointed at the monk's nose and questioned, "How much donation did I give you before, why didn't I have a child?" The masses vied to pour out their grievances. The 52 aggrieved households raised 45 issues regarding rent and interest and more than 60 issues regarding the abbot's evil deeds. The more they complained, the sadder the masses became, and they questioned, "You chant Amitabha all day long, why do you only exploit people? You turn our blood and sweat into gold and put it on clay statues to deceive people. What are you up to?" The abbot of Qingfeng Temple, forced by reason, was speechless and had to admit to compensating the masses for their losses. As a result of the liquidation, more than 700 shi of millet and more than 260 mu of land were returned to the masses. In order to take care of his future life, they allowed him to return 120 shi of millet less. The monk was very grateful for the leniency of the masses.

　　经过深入检查长治群运再起
    八村斗倒假开明恶霸
    高平城关清算金峰寺当家和尚不法剥削
    【本报长治十四日电】经过深入的检查与发动，长治群运再度掀起。小辛庄、鹿家庄、史家庄及潞城陈庄等八村三百多债户，已重新掀起对小辛庄梁维翰高利贷盘剥的清算斗争。梁外号“大麻树”，是当地大恶霸，以高利贷剥削敲诈农民极为残酷。特别是民国三十二年灾荒时期，更以重利放粮，一石粮两个月即收利五斗，大发灾荒财。其四百余亩好地及十二头牲口，均掠自附近八村农民之手。这次和他斗争的三百多债户，大部均系被剥削破产者，今春群运中，梁怕群众和他清算，一面恐吓农民，造谣欺压，不许减以后的，不许退以前的；一面将其霸占土地拿出五十亩以缓和斗争，假装开明分给贫农。由于当时领导上未能大胆给群众撑腰，亦未形成联合斗争，以致八村群众均未翻身。经过日前检查，各村农民均迫切要求对他清算，区干部乃发动八村群众广泛酝酿。九月下旬，各村债户齐集小辛庄开诉苦大会。三百多人涕泪交流地诉出自己被梁霸地霸产，克扣对敌服役之工资等冤事数百件。梁在债户质问下理屈词穷，低头认错，愿赔偿群众所有损失。八村债户当即成立联合清算委员会，进行算账。农民高兴的说：“砍倒这棵‘大麻树’，可算见到了青天”。
    【本报阳城十四日电】高平城关群众清算不法地主——金峰寺当家和尚的斗争已胜利结束。在清算大会上，八十多岁的老汉何保则诉苦说：“我给你金峰寺当了一辈子长工，俺孩子也给你当长工，谁知道老牛力尽刀头死，到如今你把我赶出庙门，成天讨饭，这就是你念佛经的人作的事吗？”佃户马世清说：“我以前租你五亩坏地，每年打五石多粗粮，你一亩地就要我八斗租子，交你四石，下余一石多，光犁地就得六七斗，加上锄苗、上粪还不够本钱，我辛苦一年，落不着一碗稀饭！”马世清谈到这里，泪如雨下。几个妇女说：“以前我们求孩子，和尚说：给我们老爷多上些布施钱，保管你们生孩子。给大钱的生男孩，给小钱的生女孩，给皮钱的生瞎子。”申九儿指着和尚的鼻子质问道：“我以前给了你们多少布施钱，为啥没生一个小孩来？”群众争相诉苦，五十二户苦主共提出租息问题四十五件，恶霸问题六十余件。诉的苦越多，群众越难过，纷纷质问说：“你成天念阿弥陀佛，为啥光剥削人？把咱们的血汗换成黄金弄到泥胎上又来迷惑人，你是安的啥心眼？”清峰寺当家和尚为道理所逼，无言以对，只得承认赔偿群众损失。清算结果，该退还群众小米七百余石，土地二百六十多亩，大家为照顾其今后生活，特让他少出小米一百二十石，和尚非常感激群众的宽大。
