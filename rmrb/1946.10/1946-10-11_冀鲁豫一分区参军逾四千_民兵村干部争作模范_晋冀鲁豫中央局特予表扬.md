　　[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] More than 4,300 new soldiers from Feicheng, Taixi, and Dong'a counties in the first sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu successively passed through the sub-district in late September and went to the front lines. During the conscription movement in the three counties, village cadres and militia played a leading and exemplary role, and were commended by the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu. When the new soldiers from various counties rushed to the front lines of patriotic self-defense, the villages welcomed them from afar and competed to offer comfort. Military and political leaders of the sub-district personally attended and spoke at the farewell rally for new soldiers in Feicheng. Director Qing of the Political Department pointed out that the leading role played by party, government and people's cadres in the conscription movement should be well studied everywhere. Commissioner Xie said, "New soldiers are the advanced elements of the three million people in the entire district. You could not bear the oppression of traitors, landlords, and bullies and rose up to turn yourselves over, and now you cannot bear Chiang Kai-shek's attack and generously join the army." He called on everyone to wage a resolute struggle against the rumors and sabotage of spies on the front lines, and to fight against the backward thinking of wanting to go home when encountering difficulties. The new soldiers shouted slogans at the meeting: "We are the people's army, and we will never go home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attack!" and then marched in formation to the front lines. In order to eliminate the worries of the new soldiers about their families, Taixi specifically re-determined detailed measures to solve the problems of military families, and thoroughly solved the problems of firewood, water, and even food, clothing, housing, and debts for poor military families.
