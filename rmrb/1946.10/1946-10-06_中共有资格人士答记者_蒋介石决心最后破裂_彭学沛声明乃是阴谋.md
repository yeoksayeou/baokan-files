Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Chiang Kai-shek's spokesperson, Peng Xuepei, issued a statement on the 2nd, indicating that the Kuomintang had agreed to open a three-person meeting, but it was claimed that its task would be to stipulate that eighteen divisions of the Communist army would enter designated locations at a designated time. Only after agreements are reached on this issue, as well as the reorganization of the National Government and the list of National Assembly delegates, can the government agree to a ceasefire. A reporter recently interviewed a qualified person from the Communist Party of China on this matter, and the questions and answers are as follows:

Question: Is Chiang Kai-shek prepared for a ceasefire?

Answer: There is no indication of this at present. On the contrary: (1) Chiang Kai-shek is still attacking Zhangjiakou, although the CCP has solemnly notified him and Marshall that attacking Zhangjiakou would mean a final rupture. Peng's statement avoids this point, indicating Chiang Kai-shek's determination to rupture. (2) Chiang Kai-shek is now massively expanding the army, conscripting soldiers, borrowing money, buying war materials, arresting and killing democratic人士, banning democratic books and newspapers, and even daring to openly promote so-called "bandit suppression." All of this is preparing to fight the war to the end. (3) Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly rejected the suggestion to convene a three-person meeting to announce a ceasefire. Now he suddenly agrees, but his plan is to use the three-person meeting to approve his illegal occupation and illegal transfer of troops in violation of the ceasefire order, and to put the Communist Party and all democratic forces to death. When Chiang Kai-shek had already thoroughly torn up the military reorganization plan by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the subsequent deployment of troops to attack the Liberated Areas, expand the army, and conscript soldiers, Peng's statement demanded that the People's Liberation Army be unilaterally bound by the so-called military reorganization plan, which is ironclad proof of this conspiracy.

Question: What kind of task should the three-person meeting undertake?

Answer: The first task of the three-person meeting should be to unconditionally restore the validity of the January 10th ceasefire order, that is, the areas illegally occupied by Chiang Kai-shek after January 13th must be withdrawn, and the troops illegally transferred by Chiang Kai-shek must be withdrawn to their original positions. This is the only legal, reasonable, and effective guarantee for peace. If this cannot be done, we are determined to fight to the end for the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference!

Question: What is the CCP's attitude towards participating in the government and the National Assembly?

Answer: Only after peace based on the January 10th ceasefire order is guaranteed can the CCP consider these issues.

　　中共有资格人士答记者
    蒋介石决心最后破裂
    彭学沛声明乃是阴谋
    【新华社延安三日电】蒋介石发言人彭学沛于二日发表声明，表示国民党已同意开三人会议，但据称其任务将为规定中共军十八个师，于指定时间进入指定地点，在此项问题及国府改组、国大名单等问题获得协议后，政府方可同意停战。记者顷以此事访问中共有资格人士，问答如下：
    问：蒋介石是否准备停战？
    答：现在并无任何此类迹象，相反的：（一）蒋介石现仍在进攻张家口，虽然中共已郑重通知他与马歇尔，进攻张家口即为最后破裂。彭氏声明避开此点，表明蒋介石的破裂决心。（二）蒋介石现正大量扩军、征兵、借款、买战争物资、捕杀民主人士、查禁民主书报，甚至敢于公开宣传所谓“剿匪”，这一切都是准备把战争打到底。（三）蒋介石再三拒绝了召集三人会议宣布停战的建议，现在他忽又同意了，但他的计划却是经过三人会议来批准他的违反停战令的非法侵占和非法调动，并将共产党与一切民主力量置于死地。当蒋介石早经国民党二中全会和后来的调动军队进攻解放区、扩军、征兵、彻底撕毁了整军方案的时候，彭氏声明却要求以所谓整军方案来片面的束缚人民解放军，便于此项阴谋的铁证。
    问：三人会议应负何种任务？
    答：三人会议的第一项任务，应该是无条件恢复一月十日停战令的效力，即一月十三日以后蒋介石非法占领的地区必须退出，蒋介石非法调动的军队必须撤回原来位置，这是和平的唯一合法合理和有效的保证。如果这一点办不到，我们决为停战协定及政协决议奋斗到底！
    问：中共方面对于参加政府与国大的态度如何？
    答：只有在一月十日停战令基础上的和平获得保证后，中共才能考虑这些问题。
