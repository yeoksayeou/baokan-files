　　Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-East Front, 5th: Our correspondent reports that Leting, occupied by Jiang's troops, has become an isolated city surrounded by the flames of people's guerrilla warfare. Zhang Zhixi, the county magistrate appointed by the Jiang faction, spent 15 taels of gold after taking office to bribe his superiors to send more troops. On September 23rd, the 5th Division of Jiang's troops stationed in Luan County reluctantly dispatched a battalion of soldiers to Leting to "lift the siege," but the resourceful guerrillas had already set up an ambush on the Luan (County)-Leting (County) highway. When Jiang's troops swaggered to Yaojiafangzi, the guerrillas launched a fierce attack, killing and wounding dozens of Jiang's soldiers, who fled in disgrace. Zhang Zhixi妄想(wàngxiǎng - presumptuously attempted) to maintain the Luan-Leting highway and prepared to conscript laborers to build a碉堡(diāobǎo - blockhouse) every two li along the highway. The Eighth Route Army guerrillas immediately shot or drove back the lackeys who were ordered to conscript laborers. Once, a team of puppet troops was sent out to督促(dūcù - urge) road repairs, and just as they reached the vicinity of Xijiao Village west of the city, they were surrounded and annihilated by the guerrillas who had been lying in wait there, and the only type 82 mortar in the city was seized. On August 25th, Jiang's puppet troops, with double the number, set out to collect grain in the area north of the city. When they reached places like Liugezhuang and Ninggezhuang, they again fell into the firepower encirclement of the guerrillas. Just as they struggled to escape, another iron ring closed in. The entire 5th company of Jiang's troops was wiped out. Now Zhang Zhixi can only be used in an isolated city of several li in latitude and longitude to督导(dūdǎo - supervise) his subordinates to "固守(gùshǒu - stubbornly defend)" the city walls.

　　群众游击烽火包围中
    乐亭蒋军寸步难移
    【新华社冀东前线五日电】本报记者报导，蒋军侵踞的乐亭已成群众游击战争烽火所包围的一座孤城。蒋方委派的县长张志熙，上任后花了十五两黄金，贿赂上级加派军队。九月二十三日驻滦县蒋军第五师勉强派出一营兵力来乐亭“解围”，但机智的游击队早已在滦（县）乐（亭）公路上设置了伏兵，待蒋军大摇大摆开到姚家房子时，游击遂猛烈出击，蒋军被毙伤数十人，狼狈窜逃。张志熙妄想保持滦乐公路，准备大抓民夫沿公路每段两里就修一座碉堡………，八路军游击队即将奉命出去抓夫的狗腿击毙或打回去。有一次派了一队伪军出动，督促修路，刚走到城西西郊庄附近，即遇预伏该处的游击队包围歼灭，并缴获全城仅有的一门八二式迫击炮。八月二十五日，增加了一倍数目的蒋伪军出发到城北一带催粮，行至刘各庄宁各庄等地时，又陷入游击队的火力包围中。刚刚挣脱逃去时，另一个铁圈又围拢过来。蒋军第五连全部覆灭。现在张志熙只能用于纵横几华里的一座孤城中，来督导所属“固守”城墙了。
