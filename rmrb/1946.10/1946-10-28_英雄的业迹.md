Achievements of Heroic Deeds

	Assault Team Member Wei Shouze
	Soldier Wei Shouze of Unit 6016, in the Battle of Dayang Lake, created a brilliant record of capturing weapons from the Chiang army four times. At 2 a.m. on the 5th night, our army was engaged in street fighting with the Chiang army in Dayang Lake Street. A Chiang army 82mm mortar, under the cover of rifles and machine guns, was bombarding our army. Assault team member Wei Shouze keenly spotted the mortar, rushed forward, and seized the cannon. After Wei Shouze handed the mortar over to the deputy company commander, he charged forward throwing grenades, scaring a Chiang army artilleryman who picked up a small cannon and ran. He caught up, grabbed the small cannon barrel, and pulled it backward, causing the Chiang soldier to fall to the ground. By the time the Chiang army artilleryman rubbed his eyes and got up, the small cannon had already been handed over to the deputy company commander by Wei Shouze. For the third time, Wei Shouze captured a crooked-neck light machine gun from a Chiang army bunker. With a spirit of dissatisfaction, he said, "Mortars, small cannons, and light machine guns have all been captured, but there are no rifles yet. I am determined to capture a few more rifles."
	Wei Shouze quickly ran to a courtyard. The Chiang army soldiers in the house were shooting at him, but he calmly began battlefield shouting. As a result, seven Chiang army 38-style rifles were sent out from the doorway one by one. Old Wei carried eight 38-style rifles (plus his own one) on his shoulders and returned to Deputy Company Commander Niu, smiling happily.

	High Walls Can't Stop Heroes
	The Seventh Company of Unit 6016 reinforced from the position of Unit 6018. The Chiang army madly fired at the Seventh Company from bunkers. The brave men engaged in fierce fighting with the Chiang army at a distance of forty meters. Grenade experts Liu Maolin, Li Wenji, Wang Zhongxin, and Wang Jianqing threw more than a dozen grenades in a row, blocking the Chiang army's firing. Liu Maolin took the lead in rushing forward, followed by everyone else. The Chiang army retreated. There was a six-foot-high wall in front of them. The brave men were red-eyed. Everyone opened their arms like tigers and pushed down the high wall with a bang. The brave men pursued the Chiang army in two directions. Pang Wuzi jumped up and grabbed an enemy crooked-neck machine gun. Wang Yuqing and Chen Shenai captured twenty-one Chiang army soldiers. At this point, more than fifty Chiang army soldiers were captured by the brave men.

	Zhang Ping'an is Brave and Good at Fighting
	The assault position of the Third Platoon of the Sixth Company of Unit 6017 was an open area. Platoon Leader Zhang Ping'an first reconnoitered the assault position. He carefully considered how to cross this open area without causing casualties to his comrades. After reconnoitering the terrain, he returned to the platoon and reported to everyone, "I have found a way to go." At 12:30 a.m., the attack began. Zhang Ping'an led his eight comrades, like an iron chain, using the tactics of leapfrogging and mutual cover, passing through the open area and the Chiang army's bullets, and attacking Dayang Lake. Suddenly, they encountered a high wall. In this extremely tense situation, he first directed a soldier to step on his shoulders, he held the wall and carried the soldier, and the soldier's machine gun poked out from the top of the wall and chattered away. The Chiang army fled one after another. When enemy tanks crawled towards them, he calmly directed everyone to repel the tanks. The battle ended, and Zhang Ping'an's eight soldiers were still united around him, not one missing. The regiment commander of the regiment especially praised Platoon Leader Zhang Ping'an, saying, "Not only brave, but also good at fighting."

	We Also Completed the Plan
	Wang Dewen, a brother liberated in the Battle of Lanfeng, saw others making combat plans and challenging each other before the Battle of Dayang Lake. He felt strange and was also moved by everyone. He said, "You all say to capture a few prisoners and seize a few guns. I also plan to capture two prisoners and seize two guns." He was very mobile, brave, and obedient to command on the battlefield. In the battle, he captured two Chiang army soldiers and seized three 38-style rifles. After the battle, everyone was talking about who had seized how many guns and captured how many prisoners. He also smiled and told everyone, "I also completed the plan."

	Zhu Xinghai and Sheng Si'en
	There were two soldiers in the Seventh Company of a certain regiment, one named Zhu Xinghai, who was originally a platoon leader of Ma Fawu's unit of the 40th Army of the Chiang army and a member of the Kuomintang. He laid down his weapons in the Pinghan Campaign and joined the Eighth Route Army. The other was Sheng Si'en, a Yan army soldier who laid down his weapons in the Shangdang Campaign. They both became outstanding heroes in this Battle of Dali Village.
	
	On the afternoon of September 6th, when more than 600 Chiang army soldiers fled south from Dali Village, five soldiers of the Third Platoon of the Seventh Company, led by Platoon Leader Liang Chunyin, cut off their retreat. Seeing the critical situation, the Chiang army immediately occupied Xiaofanzhai, concentrated in a courtyard, and fired with machine guns. At that time, five comrades of the Third Platoon, Zhu Xinghai, Sheng Si'en, Zhang Zhengxiu, etc., under the leadership of Platoon Leader Liang Chunyin, immediately attacked forward. Comrade Zhu Xinghai ran to the front. After throwing a few grenades in one breath, he shouted to the enemies in the wall, "The Eighth Route Army treats prisoners leniently, those who surrender will not be killed, I came from the Pinghan Campaign." The enemies in the yard were shaken by his shout. Taking this opportunity, Comrade Zhu Xinghai quickly rushed into the enemy's courtyard. He snatched a Chiang army crooked-neck machine gun with one hand, but was injured by a grenade thrown by another enemy. At this time, Comrade Sheng Si'en also rushed into the courtyard and snatched the crooked-neck machine gun. Then, Comrade Zhang Zhengxiu rushed in and seized a Czech-style machine gun. After Comrade Zhu Xinghai was injured, he continued to shout to the enemy, and he also said to the comrades next to him, "The enemy is very panicked, they have been shaken, shout louder." They launched a shouting offensive, and all more than 600 enemies surrendered. They came out of the courtyard to assemble. They concentrated the guns and were preparing to take the prisoners away when another two or three hundred enemies rushed over from the north. They immediately put down the prisoners and greeted the enemies again. The enemies were driven back. After Comrade Zhu Xinghai was injured, he kept preaching to the prisoners and explaining the Eighth Route Army's policy towards prisoners. After his explanation, the prisoners were no longer afraid. This time, the Seventh Company alone obtained six machine guns. The Eighth Company obtained two heavy machine guns, and two Czech-style and anti-tank guns. Comrade Sheng Si'en was not only very brave in this battle, but also very brave in the past few campaigns - the battles of Feixiang, Liaobo, etc. Usually, he performed best in helping the landlord carry water in the "full tank movement". During the march, his shoulders were always carrying two rifles and two rice bags. As long as he saw a comrade who was tired or weak and could not walk, he would help him carry the gun. When he arrived at the campsite to boil water and cook, he would automatically come to do it without the platoon leader assigning him. The courtyard was often swept clean. Besides work, he studied. As long as he had free time, he was always lying on the table, either reading or writing. He was loved by every comrade in the company. Now the company is preparing to promote him to deputy platoon leader. Comrade Zhu Xinghai is now also the leader of the study group. After being liberated in the Pinghan Campaign, he was always unconvinced by the Eighth Route Army. He often argued with the soldiers in the platoon. He believed that Chiang Kai-shek's army had airplanes, artillery, and machine guns helped by the Americans, and the Eighth Route Army could not defeat the Central Army. In this Battle of Dayang Lake and Dalishe, he saw with his own eyes the heroic battles of the Eighth Route Army, which eliminated the Kuomintang's strong fighting power, the 3rd and 43rd Divisions, and even the Kuomintang's armored forces transferred from Kunming were eliminated. What was particularly moving was the comrades' heroic and invincible fighting will, which made him convinced. He excitedly said, "This time I am convinced by the Eighth Route Army, I believe that the Eighth Route Army will surely win, and the Kuomintang is bound to fail."

　　英雄的业迹
    突击队员魏守则
    六○一六部战士魏守则，在大杨湖战斗中，创造了缴获蒋军四次武器的光辉战绩。五日夜下两点，我军已在大杨湖街内与蒋军展开巷战，蒋军的一门八二口径迫击炮，在步枪机关枪的掩护下，正在向我军轰击。突击队员魏守则锐敏的看清楚了迫击炮，一个箭步上去将炮夺回来。魏守则把迫击炮交给副连长后，他又在前面打着手榴弹向前冲去，吓得蒋军一小炮兵扛起小炮就跑，他赶上去抓住小炮筒向后一拉，蒋军即倒在地上。当蒋军炮手揉着眼爬起来时，小炮早经魏守则交到副连长手里了。魏守则第三次又从蒋军暗堡里缴来了一挺歪把轻机枪。他带着不满足的精神说：“迫击炮、小炮、轻机枪都缴来了，可是还没有步枪哩，我决心再缴几支步枪来。”
    魏守则飞快的跑到一处院子里，屋子里的蒋军向他射击，但他却沉着地开始了战场喊话，结果七个蒋军的三八式步枪，一条条的从屋门口送出来。老魏两肩扛起了八支三八式步枪（加上自己的一支），回到牛副连长那里，他高兴的笑开了。
    高墙挡不住英雄
    六○一六第七连，从六○一八的阵地上增援上去，蒋军从地堡里向七连疯狂扫射，勇士们在与蒋军相距四十米达远处展开激战。投弹能手刘茂林、李文基、王忠信、王剑青一连打了十多个手榴弹，封锁住蒋军的射击。刘茂林首先冲上去，接着大家一拥而上，蒋军溃退下去了。前面还隔着六尺高的高墙，勇士们气红了眼，大家像猛虎一样张开臂膀，轰通一声，推倒了高墙。勇士们分两路追向蒋军。庞五子跳上去抓住了敌人一挺歪把机枪。王玉青、陈伸爱两个人捉住了二十一个蒋军。至此，五十多蒋军被勇士们一捕而光。
    张平安英勇善战
    六○一七六连三班的冲锋阵地，是一片开阔地，班长张平安首先在冲锋的阵地上侦察了一遍，他缜密地考虑好，怎样才能通过这开阔地，使全班同志不遭受伤亡。他侦察好地形回到班里报告大家说：“我已看好去路”。夜十二时半，开始攻击了，张平安带领着他的八个同志，像一条铁链子似的按照各个跃进互相掩护的战术，通过了开阔地和蒋军的弹雨，攻进了大杨湖。忽然遇到一座高墙，在这万分紧张中，他首先指挥一个战士，踏住他的肩膀，他扶着墙驮起战士，战士的机关枪探出墙头上呱呱叫了。蒋军纷纷逃去。当敌人坦克爬向他们时，他又沉着的指挥大家击退了坦克。战斗结束了，张平安的八个战士，仍然一个不少的团结在他的周围。该团团长，特别赞扬张平安班长说：“不但英勇，而且善战”。
    咱们也完成了计划
    兰封战斗被解放的弟兄王得文，在大杨湖战斗前，他看到别人都做战斗计划互相挑战。他一面觉得奇怪，也一面被大家感动了，他说：“你们都说捉几个俘虏，缴几支枪，我也计划捉两个俘虏，缴两支枪”。他在战场上非常机动勇敢听从指挥，战斗中捉到了两个蒋军，缴到了三支三八式步枪。战斗结束后，大家都在谈论谁缴了多少枪，捉了几个俘虏。他也喜笑着告诉大家说：“咱也完成了计划”。
    朱兴海和胜四恩
    某团七连有两个战士，一个叫朱兴海，是原来蒋军四十军马法五部的一个班长，是国民党党员，在平汉战役中放下武器，参加了八路军。另一个是胜四恩，是上党战役放下武器的阎军士兵。他们都成了这次大李寨战斗中很出色的英雄。
    九月六号午后，蒋军六百多名由大李寨向南逃窜时，七连三班五个战士，在班长梁春银带领下，将它的退路截断。蒋军见情势危急，立即占领小范寨，集中在一个院子里，以机枪射击。当时三班朱兴海、胜四恩、张正修等五个同志，在班长梁春银的率领下，立即向前攻击。朱兴海同志跑到最前面，他一口气打了几个手榴弹后，就向围墙里敌人喊话说：“八路军优待俘虏，缴枪不杀，我是平汉战役过来的。”院里的敌人经他这样一喊，大部分都动摇了。趁此机会朱兴海同志很快就冲到敌人的院子里去，他一手夺过蒋军一挺歪把子机枪，但被另一个敌人抛来的手榴弹炸伤了。这时胜四恩同志，也冲到院子里，夺过那一挺歪把机枪来，接着张正修同志冲进去，夺到了一挺捷克式机枪。朱兴海同志负伤后，仍继续向敌人喊话，他并且对旁边的同志说：“敌人非常恐慌，他们已经动摇了，快些喊话吧。”他们几个展开了喊话攻势，六百多敌人全部投降了。他们从院子里出来集合，他们把枪集中起来，正准备把俘虏带走时，又有二三百敌人从北面冲过来，他们马上把俘虏放下，又迎接敌人。敌人被打了回去。朱兴海同志负伤后，他还不停息的向俘虏们作宣传，解释八路军对俘虏的政策。俘虏们经他解释，再也不害怕了。这一次光七连就得了六挺机关枪。八连得了重机枪两挺，捷克式和反坦克炮两门。胜四恩同志，不但在这一次战斗中很英勇，在过去的几次战役——打肥乡、聊博等战役中，他都很勇敢。平时在帮助房东挑水的“满缸运动”中，他执行得最好。在行军中他的肩上经常没断过两支步枪，两条米袋，他只要看到那一个同志累了，或身体弱走不动，他就去帮他背枪。到了宿营地烧水煮饭，不等班长分配，自动来干，院子里经常扫得干干净净。他除了工作就是学习，只要一有空，他总是伏在桌子上，不是看书，就是写字，他为连里的每一个同志所敬爱，现在连里正准备提升他为副班长。朱兴海同志现在也当了学习组长，他在平汉战役被解放后，对八路军总是不心服，他常常和班里的战士们抬杠。他认为蒋介石军队有美国人帮助的飞机大炮机枪，八路军打不过中央军，在这次大杨湖和大李集战斗中，他亲眼看到八路军的英勇战斗，消灭了国民党战斗力坚强的整三师和四十三师等部队，连国民党从昆明调来的装甲部队都消灭了。特别使人感动的是同志们英勇无敌的战斗意志，使他的心服服贴贴的信服了，他兴奋的说道：“这一下我可信服了八路军，我相信八路军一定胜利，国民党是一定要失败的。”
