　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Launch Full-Scale Offensive
    Chahar Province War Breaks Out
    US and Chiang Sides Actually Withdraw Zhangjiakou Group
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 29th] Chiang Kai-shek's full-scale offensive against the Chahar Province liberated area began at 2:00 AM this morning. The 94th Division of the 16th Army of Chiang's troops, advancing from the east, is attacking the villages and towns of Chadao, Xibozi, Huangshiliang, Chenjia Yaozi, and Xiaozhangjiakou, about 65 kilometers northwest of Beiping. They are still fighting with the local Eighth Route Army as of this evening. In addition, the puppet troops of Fu Zuoyi, who had sneaked into the northwest of Chahar Province from eastern Suiyuan, have been met with a powerful counterattack by the Eighth Route Army and are fleeing westward. Shangyi City, which they had once occupied, was immediately recovered. At 13:30 on the 28th, six American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes (two B-24s and four P-51s) launched the largest-scale attack on towns along the Ping-Sui Railway, lasting two and a half hours. Xuanhua Railway Station's south gate and other places suffered repeated bombings six times. The Zhangjiakou Fifth Executive Group, which had always been in a situation without major warfare, at this time of the outbreak of the Chahar Province War, has been required by both the Chiang and US sides to decide to return to Beiping tomorrow (30th). The reporter from the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily commented: "The Kuomintang's Eleventh War Zone's so-called 'no preparations to attack Zhangjiakou' smoke screen, spread by the Beiping Radio Station on the 27th, has now been washed away by the facts. A major war on the Ping-Sui Line is imminent. Chiang Kai-shek is forcing the people of Chahar Province to accept the war he has provoked. Every time Chiang's troops attack a place, the US-Chiang side of the Executive Headquarters requests the withdrawal of a group, so that Chiang Kai-shek can let go and do what he wants. The withdrawal of the Zhangjiakou group once again shows that the Executive Headquarters is gradually losing its mediation role. However, in order to defend their fields and land, the people are ready to exact a bloody price from Chiang Kai-shek. The fate of Chahar Province will "ultimately be decided by the people!"

　　蒋军开始正面进攻
    察省大战爆发
    美蒋双方竟撤退张垣小组
    【新华社张家口二十九日电】蒋介石在察哈尔省解放区的正面进攻已于今晨二时开始，自东面进犯之蒋十六军九十四师正向北平西北方约六十五公里的岔道、西拨子、黄士梁、陈家窑子及小张家口等村镇进攻，迄晚仍与当地八路军对战中。另自绥东向察省西北部窜犯之傅伪军已遭到八路军有力回击，向西逃窜，一度被其侵占之尚义城当即恢复。二十八日下午一时三十分，美制蒋机六架（Ｂ２４式两架，Ｐ５１式四架）向平绥路沿线城镇进行了规模最大的一次袭击，历时两小时半，宣化车站南关等地遭受反复六次轰炸，一向处于无重大战争情况下的张垣第五执行小组，当此察省大战爆发之际，已为蒋美双方所要求决定明日（卅日）返平。此间晋察冀日报记者评称：“廿七日北平广播电台散布国民党十一战区所谓“并未准备进攻张家口”之烟幕“声明”，现已为事实冲刷得烟消云散。平绥线大战已迫在眉睫，蒋介石迫使察省人民接受了他所挑起的战争。蒋军每进攻一地，执行部美蒋方面即要求撤回一组，以便蒋介石放手干。张家口小组的撤退，再一次说明执行部已日渐失去调处作用。但人民为保卫他们的田园土地，已准备好向蒋介石索取血的代价。察哈尔省的命运，“终久是要人民来决定的！”
