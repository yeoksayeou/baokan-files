　　[Report from our Frontline Correspondents' Group, 26th] Liberated Kuomintang soldiers on the Longhai Front, after joining the Eighth Route Army, have demonstrated a resolute and courageous spirit in the self-defense counter-offensive, and are full of confidence in victory. In the Sixth Company of the × unit, five new soldiers, including Wang Rongqing, who were liberated from the KMT's Third Reorganization Division, drew up personal combat plans just like the veteran soldiers of the Eighth Route Army. They said, "Here, we are working for the people, and it is glorious even to die!" Li Liuzhang, a new comrade in the first squad of the Ninth Company of the × unit, also drew up a plan to obey the commands of the squad leader and group leader, and resolutely not lag behind. Deng Zhenbiao, a newly liberated machine gunner from the × New Fifth Detachment, and Ma Quanping from the Fourth Company, after being wounded in the Juxi battle, persisted until the end of the battle before leaving the front line. Li Zhenxing, a soldier in the Sixth Company of the × unit, in addition to being able to bravely complete his tasks in wartime, studies very hard daily and handed over his gold ring to the instructor, saying, "I hand over everything to the public; I realize that this is my own home." These newly liberated soldiers, from being war-weary in the past, have become highly motivated, and from being timid have become brave. This is entirely because the Eighth Route Army has given them new enlightenment, enabling them to realize that the Communist Party is working for the benefit of the people and fighting to defend the motherland! They further recognized that Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people, sold out the country, and forced soldiers to sacrifice themselves for his dictatorial civil war. Therefore, they are willing to stand with the Eighth Route Army and resolutely strike at the Kuomintang troops.

　　陇海前线解放士兵参加我军
    订作战计划坚决杀敌
    【本报前线记者团二十六日电】陇海前线被解放的蒋军士兵，参加八路军后，在自卫反击战中，表现出坚决勇敢的精神，并充满胜利信心。×部六连由蒋军整三师解放出来的王荣庆等五个新战士，和八路军老战士同样的订出个人作战计划，他们说：“在这里是为人民干的，死也光荣！”×部九连一班新同志李留章，也订出计划，服从班长、组长的指挥，坚决不落后。×新五分队新解放来的机枪射手邓振标和四连马全平，在巨西战斗中负伤后，一直坚持到战斗结束才下火线。×部六连战士李振兴，除战时能勇敢完成任务外，日常很努力学习，把他自己的金戒指交给指导员说：“我把一切都交给公家；我认清了，这就是自己的家。”这些被解放的新战士，由过去厌战变为士气高涨，由怯懦变为勇敢，完全是八路军给了他们新的启示，使他们认识到共产党是为人民谋利益的，为保卫祖国而战！更认清了蒋介石背叛人民，出卖国家，强迫士兵为其独裁内战作牺牲品。因之，他们愿和八路军站在一起，坚决打击蒋军。
