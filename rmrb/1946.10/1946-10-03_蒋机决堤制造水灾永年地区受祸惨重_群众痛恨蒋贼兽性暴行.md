　　[This dispatch from Weixian, 30th] The dictator and traitor of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, devoid of all humanity, continues to use aircraft to bomb river dikes in southern Hebei, creating floods. On the 18th, he bombed and breached the Heilongtan Dike in Yongnian. The floodwaters flowed in three directions: one stream entered the Niuwei River, overflowing its banks; another stream flowed west from the Niuwei River into Jize, where the water was five feet deep in the western part of the county, and hundreds of acres of autumn fields were submerged, with no hope of planting wheat; the third stream flowed east from the Niuwei River into the Yongnian area, and the flood is still expanding. The local masses are gnashing their teeth in hatred of Chiang Kai-shek's crimes. Young people are saying, "Chiang Kai-shek, the old thief, wants to drown us. We can't just sit around and wait to die! Let's go! Join the army and fight this old thief to the death!" Now, our county and district cadres are leading millions of people in a day and night effort to repair the dikes in the raging waters.

　　蒋机决堤制造水灾永年地区受祸惨重
    群众痛恨蒋贼兽性暴行
    【本报威县三十日电】独夫民贼蒋介石灭绝人性，继续以飞机轰炸冀南各河堤岸，制造水灾，十八日又炸开永年黑龙潭大堤。洪水分三股横流，一股入牛尾河，漫堤而出。一股从牛尾河西流入鸡泽，该县西部水深五尺，数百顷秋田悉被淹没，小麦播种已无希望，一股于牛尾河东流入永年区，水势仍在扩大中。当地群众对蒋贼罪行莫不切齿痛恨，青年人都说：“蒋介石这个老贼要淹死咱们，咱们不能等死，走！参军去，和这个老贼拚命”，现我县区干部，正领导着千万群众在波涛中昼夜抢修河堤。
