Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 25th: The Eighth Route Army has achieved new victories on the Pinghan Front. On the 24th, in the area of Caohetou and Xicaodian, 30 miles north of Baoding, it annihilated the Second and Third Regiments of the First Column and the Second Column of the Eleventh War Zone of the Kuomintang, one battalion of the First Regiment's remnants (the remaining two battalions were annihilated in the first phase of the operation), and units directly under the column, totaling more than 4,000 people. This is the truth behind the Central News Agency's boast in recent days about the Chiang army in Baoding moving north and "achieving victory." Note: Since the Eighth Route Army launched a successful counterattack on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway at 21:00 on the 29th of last month, controlling more than 300 miles of the railway line north and south of Baoding, the Kuomintang military authorities were caught off guard. At the beginning of this month, they urgently dispatched the Fifth Division and the 121st Division of the 94th Army to reinforce Baoding. In order to more effectively annihilate the enemy's active forces, the Eighth Route Army successively and voluntarily withdrew from Songlindian, Gaobeidian Railway Stations, and Dingxing and Xushui county towns. The Chiang army in Baoding, in order to "welcome reinforcements," began to advance north on the 23rd and scurried to the Caohetou and Xicaodian line on the 24th. The Eighth Route Army immediately surrounded them completely and, after 21 hours of continuous fierce fighting from 17:00 that day, resolved the battle. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 3,000 Chiang soldiers were captured alive, and more than 1,000 were killed or wounded; a large number of supplies were seized, and are currently being inventoried.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 26th: The Chiang army invading Lianshui, Northern Jiangsu, has suffered a disastrous blow, with more than 4,000 already annihilated, and the routed troops are being pursued. This is a new victory for the New Fourth Army of Jiangsu and Anhui, following eight previous major victories. From the afternoon of the 19th, the entire 51st, 57th, and 58th Brigades (original divisions) of the 74th Division (original army) of the Chiang army, advancing northeast from Lianghuai (Huaiyin and Huai'an), launched an attack on Lianshui City. By the morning of the 22nd, several routes converged to attack Lianshui City. When the Chiang army's 51st Brigade advanced to the outskirts of the city, the New Fourth Army rose up and gave it a fierce blow. By the evening of the 23rd, more than 2,000 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than 1,000, including those below the rank of battalion commander, were captured. The remnants of the Chiang army fled south in a panic on the afternoon of the 24th under the cover of five American-style B-24 bombers and seven fighter planes. The New Fourth Army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and that evening annihilated another 600 or so of the fleeing Chiang army's rearguard regiment on the silted Yellow River beach in the Wu Village area, two miles southwest of Lianshui. Two battalions of the Chiang army's 58th Brigade, which had occupied Daihe Town, were also routed by the New Fourth Army's counterattack on the same evening, and the town was immediately recovered. At this point, the 51st Brigade and one regiment of the 57th Brigade and two battalions of the 58th Brigade of the Chiang army's 74th Division have all suffered heavy losses. The New Fourth Army is continuing to track and pursue, expanding the results of the battle. Note: This division (the original 74th Army) is a directly controlled elite unit of Chiang Kai-shek, formerly under the command of Wang Yaowu, and is entirely equipped with American weaponry. It was originally a Nanjing garrison force directly under the General Headquarters of the Kuomintang Army.

　　平汉北段华中涟水我军双捷
    蒋军精锐八千被歼
    蒋介石以和平烟幕掩盖军事进攻破产
    【新华社平汉前线二十五日电】平汉前线八路军获得新胜利。二十四日于保定以北三十里之漕河头、西漕店一线，歼灭由保定出犯之国民党十一战区第一纵队、第二纵队之第二、第三两个团，第一团残部一个营（其余两营已在第一阶段作战时被歼）及纵队直属队，全部四千余人。这就是中央社连日吹嘘保定蒋军北上“告捷”的真相。按：自上月二十九日二十一时八路军在平汉北段胜利反击，控制保定南北三百余里铁路线后，国民党军事当局仓惶失措，于月初急调九十四军第五师及一二一师向保定增援。八路军为更有效歼敌有生力量，先后主动撤出松林店、高碑店车站及定兴、徐水县城，保定蒋军为“迎接援军”，于二十三日开始北犯，二十四日窜至漕河头，西漕店一线，八路军即将其全部包围，自当日下午十七时连续激战二十一小时之久始解决战斗。据初步统计，共生俘蒋军三千余，毙伤一千余；缴获极众，现正清查中。
    【新华社华中二十六日电】进犯苏北涟水蒋军遭受惨重打击，已有四千余人就歼，溃逃部队正被追击中；这是苏皖新四军继过去八次大捷后之新胜利。十九日下午起，自两淮（淮阴淮安）向东北出犯之蒋军七十四师（原军）五十一、五十七、五十八三个旅（原师）全部进攻涟水城，至二十二日晨，数路会攻涟水城。当蒋军五十一旅进抵城郊时，新四军奋起予以猛烈打击，迄二十三日晚，毙伤蒋军二千余，俘营长以下一千余，蒋军残部于二十四日下午在美式空中堡垒五架与战斗机七架掩护下向南狼狈逃窜。新四军乘胜追击，当晚又将该逃窜蒋军尾后一个团六百余名歼灭于涟水西南二里吴庄一带之淤黄河沙滩上。侵占带河镇之蒋军五十八旅两个营，亦于同日晚遭新四军反击溃逃，该镇即告恢复。至此，蒋军七十四师五十一旅及五十七旅一个团五十八旅两个营均受到惨重损失，新四军正继续跟踪追击，扩大战果中。按该师（原七十四军）系蒋嫡系精锐王耀武旧部，全系美械装备，原为国民党陆军总部直辖南京卫戍部队。
