　　Gucheng First District Seizes the Opportunity to Resolve Land Issues; 500 Poor Families Obtain Land
　　[Our Weixian Dispatch] Through two months of mass movement, most villages in Gucheng County's First District have resolved the land issues for farmers. In the entire district, 580 poor families recovered more than 4,500 mu of land, with the largest landlord, Jie Wuyi's family, surrendering 3,000 mu alone. Simultaneously, the interests of middle peasants were practically taken care of during the movement, and the embezzlement and concealment of land by 38 middle peasant households were appropriately addressed (without penalty). When dealing with landlord land, middle peasants were also taken into consideration. In the past, landlords engaged in false displays of wealth and sham sales of land, with most of it ending up in the hands of middle peasants. During land reform, a portion of the surplus land from middle peasants had to be allocated to landless or land-poor impoverished farmers for cultivation. Impoverished farmers who should have received land without compensation voluntarily offered some money to the middle peasants. All middle peasants who did not receive land were given cash and some trees and homesteads left by the landlords. The liberated farmers have generally organized themselves, and the militia has doubled in size. During the movement, more than 400 former puppet soldiers and puppet officials repented and turned over 34 rifles and pistols.
　　[Another Dispatch] The reason Gucheng First District has achieved great results is mainly because the leadership has grasped four key aspects: First, they have seized upon and commended the new creations of the masses, such as the "ox head" experience in rent reduction in Dongbalizhuang and the land distribution method of Xia Village. They used various conferences to disseminate these experiences and published commendations in newspapers, which played a significant role in promoting the work and boosting the morale of the masses. Second, they tightened control where needed and relaxed it where possible, establishing a system of summarizing and checking every half month. Work that was not closely related to the central task was relaxed, fostering a climate among cadres of "relaxing on ninety-nine things to complete one thing." As a result, tasks could be completed on time, and people felt relaxed and happy. Third, they adopted a "drilling in to lay the foundation" approach, starting from the grassroots level, immersing themselves to understand the situation, and then cultivating activists, vigorously supporting them, thoroughly dismantling reactionary groups, and resolutely reforming leadership components. After victory, they held large-scale celebrations to expand influence and educate the masses. Fourth, merits must be rewarded. Activists should be rewarded, and models of liberation should be elected among the cadres in the entire district and awarded prizes separately. Cadres who do not serve the masses must be reformed based on the opinions of the masses.

　　故城一区抓紧解决土地问题
    五百户贫民获得土地
    【本报威县讯】故城县一区两个月的群众运动，大部村庄解决了农民土地问题。全区五百八十户贫民收回土地四千五百多亩，最大的地主解五一家就退出土地三千亩。同时在运动中切实照顾了中农利益，适当解决三十八户中农贪污、黑瞒地等问题（未罚）。在处理地主土地时也照顾到中农，过去地主假富假卖土地，大部落到中农手里，实行土地改革时，不得不从中农多余的土地中，调剂一部给无地或少地的赤贫农耕种，本来应该无代价取回土地的赤贫农，都自动拿出一部分钱给中农，所有没有分到土地的中农都分到了现款和地主遗留一些树木宅基等。翻身后的农民普遍组织起来，民兵发展了一倍。运动中并有悔过自新的伪军伪员，共达四百多名，并交出三十四支长短枪。
    【又讯】故城一区所以能收到很大成绩，主要是领导上掌握了四个环节：一、抓紧表扬群众的新创造，如东八里庄减租中争取“牛头”经验和夏庄农民分配土地办法，利用了各种会议的传播以及登报表扬，对推动工作和鼓舞群众情绪上起很大作用。二、抓的紧放的松，建立了半月一总结一检查的制度，凡是和中心工作无大联系的工作要放松，在干部中形成“放松九十九件完成一件”的风气，这样结果能按期完成任务，也感觉轻松愉快。三、钻进去垒地基的干法，首先从下层着手，插进腿去了解了情况后，即培养积极分子，大力为他们撑腰，彻底拆散反动集团，狠心改造领导成份。胜利后就开大会庆祝，扩大影响，教育群众。四、有功要赏，对积极分子要奖励，全区干部中选举领导翻身模范，分头发奖。对一些不为群众服务的干部，根据群众意见一定要改造。
