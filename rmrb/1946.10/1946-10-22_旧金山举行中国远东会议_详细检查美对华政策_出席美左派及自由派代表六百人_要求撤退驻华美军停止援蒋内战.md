　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: United Press International, San Francisco: Six hundred representatives of American leftists and liberals gathered here on the 18th for a three-day meeting to thoroughly examine American Far East foreign policy, especially American policy towards China. This meeting is the long-rumored "Far East China Conference." The conference will pass resolutions calling on the U.S. government to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China, cease financial aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and stop handing over military supplies to Chiang Kai-shek. Among the attending representatives and initiators are the most famous leftists, who have been running around calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. Marines stationed in China for months. The conference opened with retired Marine Brigadier General Carlson as chairman. Carlson is the chairman of the National Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far East Policy. This committee is a joint organization of more than ten progressive groups in the United States, with more than 15 million members, all of whom are the group initiators of this "Far East China Conference." Other well-known initiators of this conference include Joseph Curran, president of the National Maritime Union of America, Harry Bridges, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, black singer Paul Robeson, liberal Congressman DeLacy, and Vito Marcantonio (Labor Party Congressman from New York), movie stars John Garfield, Paulette Goddard, Gregory Peck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Brigadier General Carlson said that he suggested that the conference expand its scope to include Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the occupation policy of Japan, in addition to China. Carlson said that the Communist army opposing Chiang Kai-shek is carrying out land reform to realize Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. Soong Ching-ling, Sun Yat-sen's widow, sent a telegram from Shanghai to Carlson, wishing the conference success and calling on the conference to support the Chinese people's movement to strive for Chinese unity, personal freedom, and democracy.
