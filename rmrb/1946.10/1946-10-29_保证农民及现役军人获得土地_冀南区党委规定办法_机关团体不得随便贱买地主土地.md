Guaranteeing Land for Farmers and Active-Duty Soldiers
    Regulations of the Jinnan District Party Committee
    Party and Government Organizations May Not Cheaply Buy Landlords' Land

[Our Newspaper Weixian Twenty-fifth Dispatch] In order to thoroughly realize "Land to the Tiller" and enable the vast number of farmers to obtain land, the Jinnan District Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the following measures to its subordinate Party committees regarding the handling of several land issues in the mass movement: (1) Land and houses seized by traitors and extorted from farmers should be unconditionally returned to the original owners when the government confiscates them, or allow the original owners to redeem them. Those that the government has confiscated and distributed to government organizations and troops for cultivation should also be investigated and unconditionally returned to the original owners or allowed to be redeemed. (2) In the mass struggle, if landlords are unwilling to return the land to the masses and instead give or sell it cheaply to our cadres and government organizations, this is a conspiracy by the landlords to evade the struggle and sow discord between us and the masses. All such organizations and cadres are not allowed to accept or purchase it. Those who have accepted or purchased it in the past should find ways to return it or transfer it to the masses at the original price. (3) In the mass struggle, no government organization or cadre can use their political status to compete with the masses for land and housing at low prices, let alone speculate for profit by buying cheap and selling dear, and compete with the masses. Those who have competed for purchases at low prices or profited from speculation in the past should be dealt with appropriately according to the severity of the circumstances, and it will never be allowed in the future. However, land and houses that the masses do not want, and land and houses that the masses sell as fruits of struggle, are not subject to this restriction. (4) Individual cadres from landlord backgrounds who secretly sell or give away private land and houses "without going through the masses" after the rise of the "Land to the Tiller" movement, in addition to the cadre receiving strict criticism, the original land and houses should be taken back and dedicated to the masses to solve the land problem of the poorest farmers. (5) For land belonging to traitors that the government has not yet confiscated according to law, government organizations and troops must not forcibly occupy and cultivate it. Any forcible occupation and cultivation will be invalid. (6) Land cultivated by government organizations and troops that remains barren to this day should be unconditionally returned to the masses and distributed to the poorest farmers for cultivation. (7) In the mass struggle, impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers (including military dependents and worker dependents) should receive more land than the general masses, and impoverished families of martyrs should receive even more. For example, if the general masses can get three mu of land, families of revolutionary soldiers should get four mu of land, and families of martyrs can get more than four mu to five mu. Among the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, families of regular army soldiers should be given more land, followed by families of local army soldiers, and then families of Party, government, and civilian workers. The amount of land left for landlords who are families of revolutionary soldiers or martyrs should also be more than that for ordinary landlords, the amount to be determined by local conditions and land distribution. All soldiers serving in the People's Army should be given a share of land, and if there is someone in the family, it should be handed over to their family members; if there is no one in the family, the village should take care of and cultivate it on their behalf, and the proceeds should also be kept in custody, and handed over to the soldier for cultivation and settlement when he returns home after demobilization.
