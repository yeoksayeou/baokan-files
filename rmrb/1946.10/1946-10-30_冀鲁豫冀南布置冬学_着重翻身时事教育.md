　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei Deploy Winter Studies
    Focusing on Emancipation and Current Affairs Education
    [Report from our newspaper] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei Administrative Offices recently issued notices calling for the launch of the winter study movement. It was emphasized that this year's winter studies should focus on political education—the masses' emancipation education and current affairs education. It should re-emphasize the nature of Chiang Kai-shek and his conspiracy to sell out China, expose the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, enhance the masses' awareness of emancipation and struggle, mobilize all forces to support the front, defend the liberated areas, and strive for the victory of the overall resistance. Both administrative offices pointed out that under the principle of prioritizing political education, in areas where the masses have been fully mobilized, production mutual aid education and cultural education should be combined, and winter studies should be used as a powerful weapon to systematically eliminate illiteracy. In areas where the masses have not been mobilized, it should be coordinated with mass movements to strengthen the masses' emancipation education, improve their class consciousness, and enable them to fight for thorough emancipation and defend the fruits of emancipation. Consolidate their own victory ideologically and always follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

　　冀鲁豫冀南布置冬学
    着重翻身时事教育
    【本报综合讯】冀鲁豫与冀南行署于日前相继发出通知，号召开展冬学运动。并强调指出今年冬学，应以政治教育——群众的翻身教育和时事教育为主，应再认识蒋介石的本质，及其出卖中国的阴谋，并揭穿美帝国主义的侵略野心，增强群众翻身的自觉性与斗争性，动员一切力量支援前线，保卫解放区，争取全面抵抗的胜利。两行署均指出：在以政治教育为主的原则下，在群众已充分发动的地区，应结合进行生产互助教育及文化教育，应把冬学做为有计划扫除文盲的有力武器。而在群众未发动的地区，则应配合群众运动，加强群众的翻身教育，提高其阶级觉悟，使其为彻底翻身及保卫翻身果实而斗争。从思想上巩固自身的胜利，永远跟毛主席和共产党走。
