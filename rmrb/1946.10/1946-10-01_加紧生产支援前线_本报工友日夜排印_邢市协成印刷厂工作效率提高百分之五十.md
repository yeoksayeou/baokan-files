　　Step Up Production to Support the Front Lines
    Our Newspaper Workers Print Day and Night
    Xiecheng Printing Factory in Xing City Increases Work Efficiency by 50 Percent
    [Our Newspaper, 29th dispatch] Since the meeting on the 25th of this month to guarantee the early publication of the newspaper, all the workers of the printing factory, under the slogan of "The front line is fighting intensely, the rear is stepping up production," have formed a vigorous processing and production movement. Every worker has shown a high degree of work enthusiasm and responsibility, working day and night, tirelessly rushing to typeset and print this newspaper. They said, "We won't rest or eat until the work is done." The typesetting room is the locomotive in this processing and production, becoming the champion of the entire factory. Due to departures for work and illness, the room had four fewer people, but this did not delay the typesetting of the newspaper. Instead, the workers showed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm to support the front lines, forgetting fatigue and ensuring the publication of the newspaper. Previously, four people typeset one page, but now only Song Fugen and Zhao Tiezhu typeset one page, and they can still complete the task on time. They said, "The front line is tense, and the rear must also become tense. We won't rest until we complete the day's task." Comrade Cao Youlin led a group of trainees working sixteen hours a day, not resting until they had assembled the page at 10 pm. Chang Heying also worked very enthusiastically, and when he received the "People's Army" newspaper, he was still working on the musical score in the middle of the night. The machine room worked even harder, printing without stopping the machines. The wheel-turning worker, Comrade "Dapao" (Big Gun), had sores on his feet, but he forgot the pain of the sores and stood in front of the machine, turning it with a whirring sound, with sweat dripping from his cheeks onto his feet. Due to his exemplary actions, the other two workers also became active, and finally, in four hours, three thousand copies of the newspaper flew out of the machine. Binding worker Zhang Xichun stayed up all night busily cutting and counting paper. Now, all the workers are working hard for the victory of the front line and the early publication of this newspaper.

    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai, 28th dispatch] The "Increase Production to Support the Front Lines" movement initiated by the Xiecheng Printing Factory in this city has achieved significant results again. The factory's work plan stipulated that the lithography room would guarantee to print more than 1,000 pages per machine per day; the machine room planned to print 9,000 pages per day on the quarto machine and 7,000 pages on the number one treadle machine; and the typesetting room decided to train two new trainees to be able to set type within a month. The old trainees would be able to assemble simple pages. After twenty days of effort, work efficiency has generally increased by 20 to 50 percent. The lithography room has achieved the best results, with the past highest daily record of 853 pages now averaging 1,200 pages. Lithography worker Miao Yigong created a new record for the factory since its establishment by printing 1,500 pages in one day. In order to further improve work efficiency, a friendly revolutionary competition has recently been launched, with mutual challenges taking place. Because they have a common idea: "Work hard to increase production and strive for an early victory in the patriotic self-defense war," their work enthusiasm is exceptionally high. (Wang Hongkui)

　　加紧生产支援前线
    本报工友日夜排印
    邢市协成印刷厂工作效率提高百分之五十
    【本报二十九日讯】自本月二十五日召开了保证提前出版报纸的会议后，印刷厂的全体工友们在“前线紧张作战，后方加紧生产”的口号下，已形成了热火朝天的加工生产运动。每个工友都发挥了高度的工作积极性与责任心，日以继夜不知疲倦的赶排赶印着本报。他们说：“不完成工作，不休息也不吃饭。”排字房在这次加工生产中又是火车头，成了全厂的冠军。他们全房因事出发和病员就减少了四人，但并不因此而耽误排报，反而工友们拿出了高度的爱国支援前线的热情，忘记了疲劳的保证了本报的出版。以前四个人排一版，现在只宋福根、赵铁柱两个人就要排一版，还能按时的完成任务。他们说：“前线紧张了，后方也要紧张起来，不完成一天的任务就不休息。”曹友林同志带领一组练习生一天工作十六小时，直到深夜十时拚好版才休息。常和英干的也很起劲，当接到“人民的军队”报时，半夜里还在做歌谱。机器房更是百倍的努力，不使机器停息的赶印着。摇轮工人“大炮”同志脚上生疮，他忘记了疮的疼痛，站在机器把前哗喇喇的摇着，脸颊上的汗水不住的落在他的脚前。由于他的模范行动，使得另两个工友也积极起来，终于在四小时内，三千份报纸就飞出了机器。装订工人张锡春夜不睡眠的在忙碌着割纸、数纸。现在全体工友都在为了前线的胜利，为了本报的提前出版而紧张的工作着。（成坊）
    【本报邢台二十八日讯】本市协成印刷厂发起的“增加生产支援前线”运动。又获显著成绩，在该厂工作计划中曾规定：石印房保证每机每日印一千版以上；机器房计划四开机每日印九千版，头号脚登机印七千版；排字房决定在一个月内培养两个新练习生能上架检字。旧练习生会拚简单的版。经过二十天的努力，工作效率普遍提高了百分之二十至五十。其中以石印房成绩最好，过去每日最高纪录为八百五十三版现在平均已达一千二百版。石印工人苗益恭以一天印一千五百版的成绩，创造了该厂成立以来的新纪录。大家为了使工作效率更提高一步，日前又掀起友谊的革命竞赛，相互进行挑战。因为他们有着一个共同的思想：“努力增产，争取爱国自卫战争早日胜利”，所以他们的工作情绪异常高涨。（王宏葵）
