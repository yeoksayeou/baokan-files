　　Bo'ai Cracks Chiang Kai-shek Secret Agent Conspiracy to Riot
    Principal Criminals Du Wanxuan and Others Apprehended
    Chiang Kai-shek Secret Agents Xu Jichuan and Others in Jiaozuo Executed
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Changzhi, 15th] The Public Security Bureau of Bo'ai County, Northern Henan, cracked a shocking Chiang Kai-shek secret agent conspiracy to riot at the beginning of this month. The Chiang Kai-shek secret agent organization in the county, the "Kaifeng Anti-Communist National Salvation Benevolence Society Bo'ai Branch" and its secret armed forces, three special agent battalions, conspired to launch a county-wide riot on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month (i.e., the 3rd of this month), massacring cadres and peasant association members throughout the county, and overthrowing the democratic regime in order to support the Chiang Kai-shek army's attack on our Jiaozuo in Xinxiang. On the 25th of last month, clues to the case began to be discovered during mass mobilization in Beiwu Village. After a week of efforts by the Public Security Bureau, the whole case became clear and was immediately cracked. The main members of the "Benevolence Society," Du Wanxuan, Wang Baigong, Song Yuhu, Song Liang, and 11 others have been arrested. Du Wanxuan was the secretary of the Kuomintang Bo'ai Third District Party Department and a major local tyrant in Wu Village. According to confessions, after receiving an order from the "Benevolence Society Headquarters" in Kaifeng in June of this year to restore the Bo'ai Branch organization, he actively colluded with Wang Baigong and others. In the past six months, they have developed a network of 3,800 people in 108 villages throughout the county. In July, they organized three special agent battalions, totaling 139 people. In August, they received an order from Kaifeng to step up preparations for a riot to support the Chiang Kai-shek army's September offensive. The county organization decided to complete preparations by the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, and on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, all villages in the county would act together, first killing the work team members and cadres in their respective villages, then gathering in the entire district to kill the district offices, and finally gathering in the entire county at Nanguan to attack the city and eliminate county government agencies and other institutions. The masses showed extremely high enthusiasm for eliminating traitors in cracking this case. Village militias, cadres, and activists were all on emergency alert on September 9th. When the masses heard about their massacre plan, they were filled with hatred and demanded that the government severely punish them. The case is currently under further interrogation.
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Jiaozuo, 14th] (Delayed) The Jiaozuo City All-Circles Anti-Special Agent Revenge Conference recently issued leaflets exposing the details of how Chiang Kai-shek secret agents Xu Jichuan and Xu Zhaofu brutally murdered Li Jinhua, the vice chairman of the Women's Federation of the Second Joint Street in Lifeng. During the famine years, Li Jinhua unfortunately became Xu Zhaofu's concubine and suffered all kinds of abuse. After the Eighth Route Army liberated Jiaozuo last year, it mobilized the masses to stand up, and Li Jinhua actively participated and was elected vice chairman of the Women's Federation of the Second Joint Street. In order to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive, Chiang Kai-shek secret agents Xu Jichuan, Xu Zhaofu, and others planned the murder of our cadres, first targeting Li Jinhua. Her head was slashed four times, and her body was dismembered into eight pieces, a horrific sight. The 60,000 citizens of Jiaozuo were all filled with outrage and organized an anti-special agent revenge conference, publicly trying and executing Xu Jichuan and others. They also called for expanding mass organizations, expanding the militia, and eliminating all of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents.
