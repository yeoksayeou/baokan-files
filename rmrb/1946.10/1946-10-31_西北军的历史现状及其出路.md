The Northwest Army, founded by General Feng Yuxiang, was once a large army with a long history. Before the Great Revolution, it was continuously growing and developing, but later it was greatly weakened by Chiang Kai-shek's policies of division, bribery, usurpation, and attrition. The remaining troops, except for a part that has joined hands with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to serve the people, are now being driven to the brink of destruction by Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy.

Feng Yuxiang was born into a poor family and joined the Qing army as a soldier. Influenced by Sun Yat-sen's revolution, he raised troops in Luanzhou in response to the Wuchang Uprising. After the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, Feng's troops gradually expanded into the Sixteenth Mixed Brigade and participated in the campaign against Yuan Shikai and the opposition to Zhang Xun's restoration. In 1920, after the Zhili-Anhui and Zhili-Fengtian wars, Feng was promoted to division commander, and his troops expanded to 50,000 men. Stationed near Beijing, they were greatly influenced by the "May Fourth" Movement. In 1924, during the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, Feng took the opportunity to imprison Cao Cao, expel Puyi, and welcome Sun Lianzhong and Duan Qirui. Feng appointed himself Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. From then on, Feng became an independent system and expanded to more than 80,000 men.

After Duan Qirui came to power, he appointed Feng as the Northwest Border Defense Commissioner, governing the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Gansu. Feng was stationed in Zhangjiakou, and the troops were reorganized into the Northwest Army, expanding to 150,000 men. The name "Northwest Army" originated from this. Influenced by the "February 7th," "May 30th," and the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the troops' education was significantly improved, abandoning the spread of Christianity and replacing it with the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. Soviet advisors were also hired, and the atmosphere was renewed. At this time, Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu, driven by imperialism, united all reactionary forces and launched a war against the Northwest Army under the slogan of "anti-communism." Feng resigned and went to the Soviet Union. After returning to China in 1926, he took the post of Commander-in-Chief of the National Army in Wuyuan. He changed the Five-Colored Flag to the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag and strengthened the political education of the troops. At that time, there were six armies, with Deng Baoshan and Xu Yongchang as army commanders. In 1927, Feng also took the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Second Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army in Xi'an, commanding six front armies, twenty-three armies, and fifty divisions. This was the peak period of the Northwest Army.

After the Northwest Army was reorganized into the Second Group Army, when it marched east from Xi'an through Tongguan into the Central Plains, it was after Chiang Kai-shek's large bourgeoisie betrayed the revolution and the split between Nanjing and Wuhan. In June, Feng attended Chiang Kai-shek's Xuzhou Conference, which was a turning point in the history of the Northwest Army. From then on, the Northwest Army embarked on a downward path. In June 1928, Feng also attended the Tianjin Conference convened by Chiang, in which the conflicting interests of various factions were deeply revealed. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek held the ambition to eliminate the heroes and dominate China.

In 1929, the first Chiang-Feng war broke out. Feng's subordinates Han Fuqu and Shi Yousan were bought by Chiang, and Feng was defeated. In March 1930, Feng once again allied with Yan Xishan to oppose Chiang, and was again defeated. Feng's subordinate Sun Lianzhong surrendered to Chiang, and the Second Group Army was declared disbanded. The Northwest Army was broken up into smaller units. Feng led a small number of directly subordinate troops to Shanxi and went into retirement. His subordinates Song Zheyuan and Sun Liangcheng were reorganized into the Twenty-ninth Army, Shi Yousan's troops were reorganized into the Thirteenth Route Army, the Third Route Army Han Fuqu was in Shandong, Sun Lianzhong surrendered to Chiang and was reorganized into the Twenty-sixth Route Army, Ji Hongchang and Zhang *xiang's troops were reorganized into the Twenty-second Route Army, and Liang Guanying's troops were reorganized into the Twenty-fifth Route Army, for a total of six units.

After the September 18th Incident, Feng once again advocated resistance against Japan, but was excluded by Chiang's agents. In 1933, during the tense situation in North China, Feng gathered his old troops and organized the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Zhangjiakou, but it was sabotaged by Chiang in many ways and failed. Feng also completely left the troops. The Twenty-ninth Army's defense of the Great Wall was also terminated by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous Tanggu Truce. The Twenty-second Route Army was forced by Chiang to "suppress the Communists" and suffered serious losses. General Ji Hongchang became thoroughly politically aware, broke away from the civil war. After traveling in Europe and returning to China, he resolutely joined the Chinese Communist Party and was assassinated by Chiang. Zhang *xiang was also shot and killed by Chiang on a pretext soon after. Liang Guanying's Twenty-fifth Route Army was transferred away from the troops by Chiang because they supported Feng's anti-Japanese activities in Zhangjiakou, and his subordinates were bought by Chiang. Shi Yousan's Thirteenth Route Army was exhausted after repeated civil wars. By this time, three of the six units had been lost. Han Fuqu's troops in Shandong were forced by Chiang to approach the Japanese invaders, and his subordinates were bought and divided (missing ten words). Sun Lianzhong's troops in Jiangxi, in the "suppression of the Communists" campaign, his subordinates Dong Zhentang and Zhao Bosheng revolted and joined the Red Army, and the Twenty-ninth Army collapsed. Chiang, in order to show favor to Sun, transferred the remaining troops of the Twenty-second Route Army to Sun's command. However, Sun was not a direct descendant, and supplements were scarce.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang held the policy of preserving his direct descendants and consuming "miscellaneous troops," so the Northwest Army suffered great losses.

During the July 7th Incident, Zhao Dengyu and Tong Linge of Song Zheyuan's troops died in battle, Tianjin and Beijing fell, the Twenty-ninth Army lost its territory, and after being transferred to various lines, they were discriminated against by Chiang. After several reorganizations, Feng Zhian's troops were reorganized into the Seventy-seventh Army, Zhang Zizhong's troops were reorganized into the Fifty-ninth Army, Liu Ruming's troops were reorganized into the Sixty-eighth Army, and Shi Yousan's troops were reorganized into the Sixty-ninth Army. Song Zheyuan served as Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army, commanding the various armies. Song's troops fought heroically against the Japanese invaders, suffering heavy losses. Chiang took the opportunity to transfer Song to the Military Affairs Commission, and he died of depression in Sichuan in 1938.

After the retreat from Wuhan, the Fifty-ninth Army and the Seventy-seventh Army were merged into the Thirty-third Group Army, with Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhian serving as commander and deputy commander, respectively. The two armies were only issued 200 rifles. Chiang sent agents to infiltrate the troops under the guise of liaison officers, doing everything possible to provoke division. An agent once asked General Zhang Zizhong to join their organization. Zhang said to his subordinates: "We didn't join the Kuomintang when it was getting married, how can we join it when it's going to the grave?" During the Battle of Henan in 1940, Tang Enbo's troops were defeated, and the Thirty-third Group Army used all its forces on the front line to cover Tang's retreat. Only one infantry regiment was left by Zhang Zizhong's side. Chiang Kai-shek took this opportunity to order Zhang to flank the Japanese army in order to relieve the danger to his direct troops. At that time, Zhang indignantly telegraphed back: "I only have one regiment, I will definitely cross the river and fight hard, and I will never return if I don't win." Zhang, as the commander of the group army, died in battle as the commander of a regiment.

Shi Yousan's Sixty-ninth Army showed progress in the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Later, he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Nineteenth Group Army and was driven by Chiang to surrender to the enemy and oppose the Communists, eventually dying for it. Liu Ruming's Sixty-eighth Army, at Chiang's instigation, participated in the manufacturing of the Queshan Massacre, brutally killing personnel of the New Fourth Army. Liu was later promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Second Group Army.

Sun Lianzhong's Twenty-sixth Route Army also showed progress in the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but was later controlled by Chiang's agents, and its combat effectiveness was greatly weakened. Han Fuqu of the Third Route Army, under the influence of Chiang's policy of non-resistance, withdrew from Shandong without a fight, and Chiang took the opportunity to execute him by shooting.

After that, Sun Liangcheng, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Thirty-ninth Group Army, and Wu Huawen, a former subordinate of Han Fuqu, were both forced by Chiang to surrender to the enemy.

During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, most of the Northwest Army had meritorious deeds. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, these troops, such as the Fifty-ninth Army, the Sixty-eighth Army, and the Seventy-seventh Army, were closer to the Wuhan Road, and Sun Lianzhong's Thirtieth and Fortieth Armies and Gao Shuxun's New Eighth Army were within reach. However, they were also deprived of the right to accept the surrender and were driven to the civil war front to attack the Eighth Route Army. Chiang's direct troops followed behind, performing the duties of a督战队 with large swords. As a result, Gao Shuxun revolted in the Handan campaign last October. Hao Pengju and others, who had once been forced to make mistakes, also successively revolted. Now all the troops have been reorganized into the Democratic National Construction Army, fighting together with the army and people of the Liberated Areas to oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, used the civil war to continue to consume the Northwest Army; on the other hand, he weakened them in the name of "reorganization." The Fifty-ninth Army was reduced by one division, and the army was demoted to a division. The Sixty-ninth Army had only one remaining 181st Division, and the division was then reduced to a brigade, which was completely annihilated in the recent war in Minquan. Only the Sixty-eighth Army, after being reorganized into a division, still had three brigades under its command. The original Third Route Army had only Cao Fulin's Fifty-fifth Army left, which was reduced to a division and, after consumption, was less than two brigades. Sun Lianzhong's Thirtieth and Fortieth Armies suffered heavy losses in the Handan campaign last year, and were later supplemented by puppet troops, for a total of five brigades. In total, the Northwest Army now has six divisions and fifteen brigades.

Since the Northwest Army was established under the leadership of Feng Yuxiang, because its vast majority of officers and soldiers were from poor peasant backgrounds, therefore, during (missing numbers) periods, they reflected the peasants' anti-imperialist and anti-feudal demands, such as the anti-Manchu Luanzhou Uprising, the anti-Yuan (missing two characters) independence, the anti-restoration campaign to suppress bandits, the capital revolution against Cao Wu, and the Northern Expedition, etc., and from the defense of the Great Wall to the July 7th War, and until the victory over the Japanese invaders, they fought bravely against Japanese imperialism on the front lines of national defense. This shows that this army has its glorious side.

However, the Northwest Army also reflected the backwardness and conservatism of the peasantry in politics. Some of its generals became warlords, forgetting their origins, forgetting the suffering of the peasants, and at critical moments, often involuntarily running to the camp of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Therefore, the Northwest Army, composed of poor peasants, turned around and became the oppressor of the people.

On the other hand, the Northwest Army, which retained the sentiments of the peasantry, not only could not closely cooperate with the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, but was also often in a discriminated position, and the contradictions were profound and could not be eliminated.

It is precisely because of the above reasons that after the failure of the anti-Chiang war in 1930, a part of the Northwest Army went to revolution, far away Dong Zhentang and Ji Hongchang, and closer Gao Shuxun and Hao Pengju; a part temporarily became the supporters of the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, serving Chiang Kai-shek as beasts of burden and suffering extremely bad treatment, but having to risk their lives. In addition, there was also a part who hesitated between having serious contradictions with the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and not having the courage to break away from the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, harboring a decadent mood, living under their eaves, allowing them to be gradually weakened and eliminated.

The Northwest Army has had a history of thirty years. What does thirty years of experience prove?

First, the Chinese people have never let down the Northwest Army. As long as the Northwest Army stands with the people, the people will support it. As long as a part of the Northwest Army stands with the people, the people will also support that part. Even some parts, after doing many bad things, return to good, and the people do not remember the old evils, do not settle old accounts, and give them warm support as before. The people cherish this armed force like parents, and place extremely sincere hopes on this armed force, hoping that the Northwest Army, composed of their children, will serve the interests of the people, serve the liberation of the people, and serve the independence, peace, and democracy of China.

On the other hand, how does Chiang Kai-shek treat the Northwest Army? He drives them like servants, and guards against them like enemies. Anyone who disagrees with Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny is assassinated openly or secretly. Whenever there is an opportunity to weaken it, he will definitely weaken it. When he can usurp it, he will definitely usurp it. The Northwest Army will definitely not have a share in good errands, and the Northwest Army will definitely have a share in risking their lives. In short, Chiang Kai-shek's policy is only to monitor, utilize, weaken, usurp, and eliminate. Under this situation, if Chiang Kai-shek is eliminated, the Northwest Army will also be eliminated. If Chiang Kai-shek "succeeds," the Northwest Army will also be eliminated. The Northwest Army under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, while betraying their conscience and doing bad things to oppose and oppress the people, lives in constant fear of being eliminated. Obviously, there is no way out. Many patriotic people in the Northwest Army (missing paragraph) are nationalistic. After Japanese imperialism surrendered, American imperialism wanted to turn China into an American colony. Now the Northwest Army under Chiang Kai-shek's rule has become Chiang Kai-shek's servants and the vanguard of American imperialism's aggression against China, taking up American weapons, wearing American clothes, and being commanded and monitored by American imperialism, to massacre their own compatriots. The officers and soldiers of the Northwest Army ask themselves in the dead of night, how can this be worthy of the many martyrs? How can it be worthy of their parents, wives, relatives, and friends?

American imperialism has already instigated Chiang Kai-shek to launch a large-scale civil war. This civil war is by no means a struggle between parties, a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but a war of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek against the Chinese people. The result of this war will determine whether China will be destroyed by American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, or whether it will achieve independence, peace, and democracy. The Northwest Army, which made outstanding contributions in the war against Japanese imperialism, is it willing to be a docile people of American imperialism? Is it willing to be the second layer of servants of American imperialism? Obviously, it is not willing.

The way out for the Northwest Army is to be with the people, not with the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, and to be Chiang Kai-shek's tool.

The way out for the Northwest Army is to fight against American imperialism for national independence, not to be the tiger of American imperialism's aggression and destroy the Chinese nation.

In front of the officers and soldiers of the Northwest Army, there are two roads. It is believed that the officers and soldiers of the Northwest Army will know how to choose. The Northwest Army is still a major military force. As long as it awakens, it can do many things for the people. As long as it awakens, it will be a serious blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek to destroy China.

　　西北军的历史现状及其出路
    新华社
    西北军为冯玉祥将军所创建，这曾经是一支有悠久历史的、数量庞大的军队。在大革命以前，它一直是不断壮大和发展的，但以后却为蒋介石的分化、收买、篡夺、消耗政策所大大削弱了。现存部队除一部已与八路军、新四军携手转为人民服务外，余部现正为蒋介石的内战政策驱向毁灭的边缘。
    冯玉祥氏幼年贫苦，及长入伍供职清军，受孙中山先生革命影响，武昌起义时，在滦州举兵响应。民国元年后，冯部逐渐扩展为第十六混成旅，曾参加讨袁及反对张勋复辟。民国九年，又经直皖、直奉战争，冯升任师长，部队扩编为五万之众，驻地临近北京，颇受“五四”运动影响，民国十三年第二次直奉战争爆发，冯趁机囚曹操，逐溥仪，迎孙联段，冯自任国民军总司令。从此，冯乃成为独立系统，扩充为八万余人。
    段祺瑞执政后，委冯为西北边防督办，辖察、绥、甘三省。冯驻节张垣，部队改编为西北陆军，扩为十五万人。西北军之名即由此始。冯受“二七”、“五卅”及国共合作影响，部队教育有显著改进，摒弃基督教的传播，代以革命的三民主义，并聘有苏联顾问，气象为之一新。此时，张作霖、吴佩孚在帝国主义等驱使下，曾联合一切反动势力，在“讨赤”口号下发动了对西北军的战争，冯乃去职赴苏。民国十五年归国后，五原誓师就国民军总司令职。改五色旗为声天白日旗，加强部队政治教育，当时共分六个军，军长有邓宝珊，徐永昌等。民国十六年，冯又在西安就国民革命军第二集团军总司令职，辖六个方面军，二十三个军，五十个师。为西北军的极盛时期。
    西北军改编为第二集团军后，从西安东出潼关进兵中原之际，正值蒋介石为首的大资产阶级背叛革命及宁汉分裂以后，六月冯氏参加蒋介石的徐州会议，这是西北军历史的转折点，西北军从此即走上了下坡路。十七年六月，冯又参加蒋召开之天津会议，会中表现各派利益矛盾甚深。当时蒋介石即抱了削平群雄触霸中国的野心。
    民国十八年爆发了第一次蒋冯之战，冯部韩复榘、石友三皆为蒋收买，冯失败。十九年三月，冯复联阎反蒋，又失败。冯部孙连仲投蒋，第二集团军遂宣告解体。西北军化整为零，冯率少数直属部队入晋下野，所属宋哲元、孙良诚编为二十九军，石友三部改编为十三路军，第三路军韩复榘在山东，孙连仲投蒋编为二十六路，吉鸿昌、张×相部改编为二十二路，梁冠英部改编为二十五路，共六个单位。
    九一八后，冯曾一度八入，主张抗日，遭蒋特排斥。二十二年华北紧张之际，冯氏曾纠合旧部，在张垣组织抗日同盟军，但遭蒋多方破坏失败。冯氏亦从此完全脱离部队。二十九军长城抗战。亦为蒋介石卖国塘沽协定所终止。二十二路军被蒋逼使“剿共”，受严重损失。吉鸿昌将军政治上彻底觉悟，脱离内战。游欧返国后，毅然加入中国共产党，遭蒋暗杀。张×相旋亦被蒋借故枪杀。二十五路梁冠英部因同冯氏张垣抗日，梁被蒋调离部队，部下被蒋收买。石友卅三路军经反复内战，消耗殆尽。至此六个单位已失去其三。韩复榘部在山东，蒋逼使之与日寇接近，收买分化其部下（中缺十余字）。孙连仲在江西“剿共”战中，所部董振堂、赵博生等起义加入红军，二十九军遂瓦解。蒋为示恩于孙，将二十二路军余部拨孙指挥。但孙非嫡系，补充很少。
    抗战中，蒋持保存嫡系消耗“杂牌”方针，西北军因此损失很大。
    七七事变时，宋哲元部赵登禹、佟麟阁战死，平津沦陷，廿九军失去地盘，辗转各线，受蒋歧视，几经改编，冯治安部编为七七军，张自忠部编为五十九军，刘汝明部编为六十八军，石友三部编为六十九军，宋哲元任第一集团军总司令，统率各军。宋部曾英勇与日寇作殊死战，损失颇大。蒋趁机调宋任职军委会，二十七年抑郁病死于四川。
    武汉撤退后，五十九军与七十七军合编为三十三集团军，张自忠、冯治安分任总副司令。两军只发给二百支步枪，蒋派特务以联络特派员名义打入部队，极尽挑拨分化之能事。曾有特务要张自忠将军加入他们的组织，张向左右表示：“国民党结婚的时候，咱们没有加入，它要进坟墓的时候，咱们还能加入吗？”廿九年中原之役，汤恩伯部溃败，三十三集团军为掩护汤部退却，都使用到第一线上去了，张自忠身边只剩下一个步兵团。蒋介石利用这个机会勒令张侧击日军，以解其嫡系部队之危。当时张氏愤慨的回电：“我只有一个团，一定渡河奋战，不胜决不回来。”作为集团军总司令的张氏便以一个团的指挥官地位战死殉国了。
    六九军石友三部抗战初期曾表现进步，后升任十九集团军总司令，为蒋驱使投敌反共，终以身死。六十八军刘汝明部曾在蒋唆使下，参加制造确山惨案，惨杀新四军人员。刘后升任第二集团军总司令。
    二十六路军孙连仲部抗战初亦表现进步，后被蒋记特务控制，战斗力大大削弱。第三路军韩复榘在蒋不抵抗政策影响下，不战退出山东，蒋乘机将其枪决。
    此后三九集团军副总司令孙良诚及韩复榘旧部吴化文均为蒋逼使投敌。
    八年抗战中，大部分的西北军是有过功绩的。日寇投降前夕，这些部队例如五九军、六八军、七七军距武汉路较近，孙连仲三十、四十军及高树勋之新八军近在咫尺，然而他们也同样被剥夺了受降的权利，却被驱到内战前线进攻八路军。而蒋嫡系部队则跟在后面执行督战大刀队的职务。去年十月邯郸战役遂有高树勋起义。一度被迫失足之郝鹏举等亦相继反正。现各部均已改编为民主建国军，与解放区军民一起为反对卖国贼蒋介石而奋斗。
    蒋介石一面利用内战，继续消耗西北军；一面假“整编”之名，削弱他们。五十九军裁去一个师，军降为师。六十九军只剩下一个一八一师、师又缩编为旅，旅最近在民权战争中完全被歼。只有六八军编为师后，还辖三个旅。原第三路军只剩曹福林五十五军，缩编为师，经消耗已不足两个旅。孙连仲之三十军和四十军在去年邯郸战役中，大部损折，后又以伪军补充，共五个旅。总计西北军现共存六个师，十五个旅。
    西北军自在冯玉祥氏领导下成立以来，由于其广大官兵均系贫苦农民出身，因之他们在（中缺数字）时期中，反映了农民之反帝反封建的要求，如反满之滦州起义，反袁之（中缺二字）独立，反对复辟的讨贼之役，反曹吴的首都革命，以及北伐战争等等，而且在长城抗战直至七七抗战，以迄战胜日寇，都在国防最前线上与日本帝国主义英勇搏战。这说明了这一支队伍是有它的光荣的一面的。
    然而西北军在政治上又反映了一种农民的落后性与保守性。其若干将领变成了军阀，忘记了自己的出身，忘记了农民的痛苦，遇紧急关头，每每不由自主的跑到大地主，大资产阶级的阵营。因之贫苦农民所组成的西北军，反转来又成为人民的压迫者。
    另一方面保有农民情调的西北军，不但不能与大地主大资产阶级密切合作，而且也常常处在被歧视的地位，矛盾是深刻的无法消灭的。
    正因为以上种种原因，所以在民国十九年反蒋战争失败后，西北军一部分走向革命，远之为董振堂、吉鸿昌，近之为高树勋、郝鹏举；一部分则暂时成为大地主大资产阶级利益的拥护者，替蒋介石当牛马，受着极坏的待遇，却要拚性命。另外，还有一部分则徘徊于既与大地主大资产阶级有严重矛盾，而又没有勇气脱离大地主大资产阶级，怀着萎靡的情绪，度其篱下的生活，任其日趋削弱与消灭。
    西北军已经有三十年的历史，三十年的经验证明什么？
    第一、中国人民从来没有对不起西北军的，只要西北军站在人民一起，人民就拥护它，只要西北军那一部分站在人民一起，人民也就拥护那一部分。甚至有些部分做了许多坏事之后，回心向善，人民不念旧恶，不算旧账，照样给以热烈的拥护。人民是像父母一样爱护这一支武装力量，对这一支武装力量，寄以极其诚恳的希望，希望他们的子弟所组成的西北军为人民的利益而服务，为人民的解放而服务，为中国的独立和平民主而服务。
    另一方面，蒋介石是怎样对待西北军的呢？驱之如仆役，防之如仇寇，凡是不同意蒋介石的暴政的，就被暗杀明杀。凡是有机会可以削弱它时，就一定削弱它。可以篡夺它时，就一定篡夺它。好差使西北军一定没有份，拚性命西北军一定有份，总而言之，蒋介石的方针只是监视、利用、削弱、篡夺消灭而已。在这种情况之下，蒋介石如被消灭，西北军也一定被消灭，蒋介石如果“成功”，西北军也一定被消灭。在蒋介石的统治之下的西北军一面背叛良心，做反对人民、压迫人民的坏事，一面却天天胆战心惊过着怕被消灭的危险生活，这样下去，显然是一点出路也没有的。西北军里不少爱国志士，（中缺一段）是有民族意识的，日本帝国主义投降以后，美国帝国主义要把中国变成美国的殖民地，现在在蒋介石统治下的西北军，做了蒋介石的仆役，又做了美国帝国主义侵略中国的先锋队，拿起美国的武器，穿起美国的衣服，受着美国帝国主义的指挥和监视，来屠杀自己的同胞，西北军将士深夜扪心自问，这如何对得起许许多多的先烈？如何对得起自己的父母妻子亲戚朋友？
    美国帝国主义已经嗾使蒋介石发动大规模的内战，这个内战决不是什么党派之争，国共之争，而是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石对中国人民的战争。这个战争的结果，将要决定中国是否给美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石所灭亡，或是取得独立、和平、民主。在反对日本帝国主义的战争中，卓著功绩的西北军难道愿意做美国帝国主义的顺民么？难道愿意做美国帝国主义的第二层仆役么？显然是不愿的。
    西北军的出路是与人民在一起，而不是与人民的敌人蒋介石在一起，做蒋介石的工具。
    西北军的出路，是为民族的独立而作反对美国帝国主义的斗争，不是做美国帝国主义侵略的虎伥来灭亡中华民族。
    在西北军官兵的面前，放着两条道路，相信西北军官兵是会自己知道选择的。西北军还是一支主要的军事力量，只要它觉悟起来，是能为人民做许多事情的。只要它觉悟起来，对于美国帝国主义和蒋介石灭亡中国的阴谋，将是严重的打击。
