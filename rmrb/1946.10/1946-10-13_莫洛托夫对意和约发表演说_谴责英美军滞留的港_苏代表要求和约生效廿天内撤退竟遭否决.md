Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 10th: Paris dispatch: On the 9th, the final day of the plenary session of the Peace Conference debating the Italian Peace Treaty, Molotov, in his capacity as head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a 30-minute speech stating: "Our main task is to ensure the interests of the people in the treaty. The people of the world yearn for lasting and stable peace. Peace must be a democratic peace, and a democratic peace must create conditions that allow all nations to develop friendly relations with each other." Regarding the Italian Peace Treaty, Molotov requested that the conference stipulate a date for the withdrawal of British and American troops from Trieste. He said that allowing British and American troops to remain in the area violates the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers and the principles of democratic peace. Secondly, he requested that the conference pass a resolution transferring the city's administration to a government elected by the People's Assembly, rather than granting broad powers to the governor. He pointed out that the British-American and French proposals were akin to turning the city into a colony, devoid of any democracy. He also stated that the Soviet Union would continue to oppose the aforementioned proposals, as they violate the principles decided upon by the Council of Foreign Ministers. In conclusion, Molotov called for unity among nations and suggested compromises on certain unresolved issues at the conference. He denounced the notion of East-West opposition, saying it was artificial provocation. He said that young Slavic nations were willing to establish friendly relations with other countries, but such relations must be based on equality and mutual benefit.

On the afternoon of the 9th, when the plenary session began voting on the eighty articles of the Italian Peace Treaty one by one, Soviet representative Vyshinsky proposed an amendment to the Free Territory of Trieste, requiring all foreign troops to withdraw from the area within twenty days of the treaty's entry into force, but it was rejected. The French proposal was passed by a vote of 15 to 6.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 9th: Paris dispatch: The Peace Conference plenary session, chaired for the first time today by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, continued its second day of debate on the draft Italian Peace Treaty. Eleven representatives spoke today, including the representatives of the four major powers. The first speaker was Belgian representative Spaak, who believed that the pessimism of social circles regarding the conference was exaggerated and criticized the Italian Peace Treaty as being too harsh. The French representative then spoke, followed by Polish Foreign Minister Zymierski, who attacked the legal system of the Free Territory of Trieste, saying that because the governor is a foreigner, he naturally cannot earn the respect of the citizens of the city. He opposed the allocation of Gorizia to Italy in the treaty and declared that the French demarcation line on the southern Italian border was unacceptable. He requested that the conference listen to the opinions of the Yugoslav representative before making a final decision.

Comprehensive news: The plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference began on the 6th. At the meeting on the 6th, the procedural bill submitted by the Four Foreign Ministers for consideration by the conference was passed (i.e., discussing the Italian Peace Treaty for three days starting from the 7th, and then discussing the peace treaty drafts of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland one by one at a rate of one per day). After the meeting on the afternoon of the 7th, Molotov rushed back to Paris from Moscow and will serve as chairman of the plenary session starting on the 8th. At the meeting on the 7th, U.S. representative Connally reiterated the U.S. view on the Free Territory of Trieste, saying: "The United States' agreement to the French demarcation line on the southern Italian border depends on whether the legal system of the Free Territory will satisfy the United States." Before the report of the Italian Political Committee was submitted to the plenary session, Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out that the wording regarding the Free Territory of Trieste was unsatisfactory and requested that the previously rejected ten-point Soviet proposal be included, stating that the Soviet side would insist on this suggestion because the legal system of the Free Territory passed by the committee was flawed.

    谴责英美军滞留的港
    苏代表要求和约生效廿天内撤退竟遭否决
    【新华社延安十日电】巴黎讯：九日为和会全会辩论对意和约的最后一日，莫洛托夫以苏代表团团长资格发表历时三十分钟的演说称：“我们的主要任务是确保和约中人民的利益，世界人民是渴望持久及稳固的和平，和平必须是民主的和平，同时民主的和平必须创造此种条件，使一切民族得发展彼此间的友谊关系。”谈到对意和约问题，莫洛托夫要求和会规定日期使英美军队撤离的里雅斯特，他说：和约中让英美军队滞留该地是违背四外长会议决定及民主和平的原则；其次他要求和会通过决议，将的城政权交给人民议会选出的政府，而不是使总督握有大权。他指出英美方案和法国方案无异把的城区变得与殖民地差不多，毫无民主可言。他并称苏联将继续反对上述方案，因这些方案违反四外长会议所决定的原则。莫洛托夫于结语时呼吁各国团结，并建议对和会某些未决问题实行妥协，他指斥东西方对立的说法，说这是人工的挑拨离间。他说：年青的斯拉夫国家愿与其他国家建立友谊关系，但此种关系必须以平等互惠为基础。
    九日下午，全会开始逐一表示对意和约中的八十条款表决时，苏代表维辛斯基提出对的里雅斯特自由区的修正案，要求规定和约生效后二十天内所有外国军队撤离该区，但遭否决，法国方案以十五票对六票被通过。
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：和会今日全会由苏联外长莫洛托夫第一次主席，继续对意和约草案作第二日的辩论。今日共有十一位代表讲话，包括四强代表在内。第一个发言者为比代表斯巴克，他认为社会人士对和会的悲观情绪是夸大的，他批评对意和约过于苛刻。接着是法国代表讲话，继之是波兰外长兹莫夫斯基，他袭击的里雅斯特自由区法制，他说：因为总督是外国人，自然不能达到的城公民的敬重。他反对和约中将哥里西亚划归意大利，并宣称法国关于南意边界的划界线是无法接受的，他要求和会最后决定前应倾听南斯拉夫代表的意见。
    【综合消息】巴黎和会全体大会于六日开始举行。六日的大会上，通过四外长提交大会考虑的程序法案（按即从七日起的三天中讨论对意和约，往后则以每天一个的速度逐一讨论罗、保、匈、芬四国和约草案）。七日下午开会后，莫洛托夫自苏京赶返巴黎，他将于八日起担任全会主席。在七日的会议中，美代表康纳利重申美国对的城自由区的意见说：“美国对法国关于意南边界划界线的同意，是看该自由区法制是否会令美国满意而定。”当意政治委员会之报告书呈交全会之前，苏代表维辛斯基指出关于的城自由区部分之措词是不能使人满意的，并要求将为前所否决之苏方十点意见载入，并称苏方将坚持此一建议，因为委员会通过之自由区法制是错误的。
