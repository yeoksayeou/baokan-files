Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Shanghai Air Dispatch: The Shanghai All-Circles Memorial Meeting for the Two Martyrs Li and Wen, defying all kinds of obstruction from the Kuomintang authorities, finally took place as scheduled at the Tianchan Theater at 9:00 AM on the 4th. Tens of thousands of people attended, and the venue was packed inside and out. On both sides of the gate, which was full of cypress branches, were pasted couplets that read, "Establish destiny for the people" and "Compete with the sun and moon for glory." The banner in the center of the venue, "The Foundation of Democracy," was even more striking to those present. Hanging on the four walls were elegiac couplets and eulogies, including those from Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and people from all walks of life. The elegiac couplet from the Democratic League was: "Taking righteousness to achieve benevolence is the master of the people; the blue sky and white sun, can people hate it?" The elegiac couplet from the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party was: "Carry on the spirit of the two martyrs, redouble our efforts to fight for democracy; Gather the indignation of the masses, wholeheartedly oppose dictatorship!" A group of workers offered: "Who says politics is not democratic? Please see assassination is also free!" A group of women offered: "Li Gongpu can't be killed, Wen Yiduo can't die!" All expressed the broad masses of people's admiration for the two gentlemen and their resentment towards the special agents' atrocities and dictatorial politics.

The Kuomintang authorities had tried to sabotage this meeting in many ways. Beforehand, Wu Guozhen had expressed to the Democratic League that "this meeting should be postponed," and then arbitrarily demanded that the presidium of the meeting and the chief celebrant should be nominated and be responsible by the Kuomintang. Later, he proposed that all speeches must be submitted to the Kuomintang for "review and approval" in advance. After several negotiations, it was finally decided to co-host the meeting, with Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Luo Longji, Cai Tingkai, Ma Xulun, Li Weihan, Deng Yingchao, Pan Zinian, and others forming the presidium, and it was agreed that there would be no attacks on each other at the meeting. However, on the day of the meeting, the Kuomintang authorities deployed military police around the venue early in the morning and strictly checked the admission tickets of the attendees. At around 7:00 AM, several large trucks arrived, carrying hundreds of "masses" in gray cloth short clothes, who rushed to occupy the first few rows of seats.

As the meeting began, the dirge, "Friends, tens of thousands of hearts carry tens of thousands of sorrows to mourn you... We will bring the flowers of victory to comfort you!" tightly grasped the hearts of those present, and the venue was solemn and dignified. Then, Mr. Shen Junru presided over the ceremony, and Shi Liang and Chu Tunan reported on the life stories of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen respectively. At this time, the special individuals sitting in the front constantly chewed melon seeds, giggled, and made noise, disrupting the order. Then, Wu Guozhen and Pan Gongzhan spoke, and they actually used the meeting to make anti-democratic propaganda. In his speech, Wu repeatedly praised the Kuomintang authorities' "democracy" in Shanghai and emphasized that the people should "abide by the law." Pan even used platitudes such as "speaking should be measured and responsible" to openly scare democratic people. At this time, the special agents cheered and applauded to cheer them on.

However, the reactionaries' garrulousness and clamor were just a disgrace in the atmosphere of the tens of thousands of people filled with grief and indignation towards fascist rule. After the crowd's applause sent Mr. Guo Moruo to the stage, Guo said in a tone full of grief and indignation: "Whenever an era changes, tragedies must happen. The deaths of the two gentlemen are a signal of the occurrence of tragedy, that is, the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle between truth and ugliness. And truth will eventually triumph!" Ms. Deng Yingchao read Zhou Enlai's handwritten eulogy on behalf of him, and the masses applauded warmly. When reading: "I solemnly swear to the martyrs with the most sincere belief—the heart will not die, the will will not be broken, peace is promising, democracy is hopeful, and the murderers will eventually be destroyed!" Thunderous applause drowned out the words. Luo Longji, in his indignation, gave a powerful response to the reactionaries' clamor. He said: "Mayor Wu said that Shanghai already has democracy and freedom; that if Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were in Shanghai, they probably would not be killed. But Yunnan is also a part of China!... Mr. Pan Gongzhan asked whether we want Anglo-American democracy or Soviet democracy. I can answer on behalf of our comrades that what he wants is democracy that allows the people to live and be human! A country where the people cannot live is not democratic!" He powerfully said: "Civil war cannot produce democracy!" Luo concluded by shouting: "People can be killed, but democracy cannot be killed! This is how it has been for hundreds of years. Those who believe that democracy can be killed will be killed by democracy! When one person falls, thousands of people will stand up!" Finally, Mrs. Li's wife, Zhang Fanyun, delivered a reply, sobbing. She said repeatedly: "They really shouldn't have died! Shouldn't have died!..." She finally suppressed her emotions and said powerfully: "We should turn grief into strength, and only by uniting can we strive for democracy!" The meeting lasted for about two hours before it dispersed.

　　冲破国民党当局百般阻挠
    上海各界追悼李闻
    “继两公精神，再接再厉争民主；汇万众悲愤，一心一意反独裁! ”
    以虔诚的信念向殉道者默誓“和平有期，民主有望，杀人者终必复灭! ”
    【新华社延安十四日电】上海航讯：上海各界追悼李闻二烈士大会，冲破国民党当局百般阻挠，终于在四日上午九时假天蟾舞台如期举行。到会群众万人，会场内外挤得水泄不通。扎满柏枝的大门两旁，贴着“为生民立命”“与日月争光”的对联。会场正中“民主之本”的横额更使与会者触目惊心。四壁悬挂挽联悼词，有宋庆龄、李济琛、陈铭枢、中共毛主席、朱总司令等及各界人士所挽者。民盟挽联，为“取义成仁，民之主也；青天白日，人可疾乎？”中共代表团之挽联为：“继两公精神，再接再厉争民主；汇万众悲愤，一心一意反独裁！”一群职工挽：“谁说政治不民主？请看暗杀亦自由！”一群妇女挽：“杀不尽李公仆，死不完闻一多！”均道出广大人民对两先生敬仰与对特务暴行独裁政治之愤恨。
    对于此次大会，国民党当局曾予多方破坏。事前吴国桢曾对民盟方面表示“此会应缓开”，随意即要求大会主席团及主祭均应由国民党出面负责，以后又提出所有讲演稿事先均须交由国民党“审查批准”，几经交涉，最后才决定共同主持，由上海市长吴国桢及李济琛、沈钧儒、郭沫若、罗隆基、蔡廷楷、马叙伦、李维汉、邓颖超、潘梓年等合组主席团，商定在会上互不攻击。但是，当日国民党当局一早就在会场四周密布军警，严厉检查到会群众的入门证。七时许又开来几辆大卡车，载来灰布短衣的“群众”数百人，抢先占了前面几十排的座位。
    会议开始，“朋友，千万颗心衔着千万悲愤来痛悼你……我们将带着胜利之花，来慰劳你！”的哀歌，紧紧的抓捉了与会人的心，会场穆肃而庄严。继由沈钧儒老先生主祭，史良、楚图南分别报告李闻二先生生平事迹，此时坐在前面的特殊人物不断口嚼瓜子，嘻笑喧哗，捣乱秩序。继由吴国桢潘公展讲话，他们竟利用大会，大作反民主的宣传。吴在致词中口口声声赞扬国民党当局在上海的“民主”，强调人民要“守法”。潘则竟用“说话要有分寸，要负责任”等滥调来公开吓唬民主人士。这时特务尽情高呼，鼓掌助威。
    然而，反动派的哓舌与叫嚣在万人充满对法西斯统治的悲愤气氛中，只不过是出丑而已。在群众的掌声将郭沫若氏送上台后，郭氏以充满悲愤的语调说：“每逢时代转换时，必有悲剧发生。两先生的死，就是悲剧发生的信号，即是光明与黑暗的斗争，真理与丑恶的斗争。而真理终于将要胜利的！”邓颖超女士代表周恩来氏宣读他的亲笔悼词，群众不断的热烈鼓掌。当读到：“我谨以最虔诚的信念，向殉道者默誓——心不死，志不绝，和平有期，民主有望，杀人者终必覆灭！”雷鸣般的掌声淹没了话语。罗隆基氏于愤恨之下，对反动派的叫嚣给予有力的回击。他说：“吴市长说上海已有了民主，有了自由；说李闻两先生如在上海，大概不会被杀死。但云南也是中国的地方呀！……潘公展先生说我们究竟要英美民主还是苏联民主，这个我可代表我们同志答复，他要的民主是要老百姓能活能做人！老百姓不能活的国家，是不民主的！”他有力的说：“内战并不能产生民主呀！”罗氏结语高呼：“人可杀，民主不可杀！几百年的历史，就是这样。凡相信民主可杀者，必被民主杀死！一个人倒下了，千百个人会站起来的！”最后，李夫人张帆筠女士致答词，泣不成声。她连说：“他们实在不该死呀！不该死呀！……”她最后抑压着感情，有力的说：“我们应该化悲痛为力量，大家团结起来，才能争取到民主！”大会历二小时许始散。
