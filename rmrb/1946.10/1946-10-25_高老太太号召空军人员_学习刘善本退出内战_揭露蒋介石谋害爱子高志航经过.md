　　Old Mrs. Gao Calls on Air Force Personnel
    To Learn from Liu Shanben and Withdraw from the Civil War
    Exposes Chiang Kai-shek's Murder of Her Beloved Son Gao Zhihang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd] Old Mrs. Gao, mother of Gao Zhihang, former captain of the 4th Group of the Kuomintang Air Force, recently called on Kuomintang Air Force personnel to immediately withdraw from the civil war and stop sacrificing their lives for Chiang Kai-shek. She told reporters that her son was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek. Gao Zhihang was from the Northeast and possessed a strong sense of national self-respect. He was dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's use of the air force to massacre compatriots. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly plotted to assassinate him, but all attempts failed. In the autumn of 1937, when enemy planes bombed Nanzhoujiakou, Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of air force did not inform Gao Zhihang in advance. When enemy planes attacked, he was forced to fight. Gao Zhihang was killed by the bombing before he could take off. Old Mrs. Gao mourns the death of her son and hopes that Zhihang's former friends, colleagues, and students will learn from Liu Shanben's righteous act and actively oppose the civil war. Old Mrs. Gao is 65 years old this year. Since the liberation of the Northeast, she has received care from the democratic government in many ways. Her fifth son has joined the democratic government and is working for it.

　　高老太太号召空军人员
    学习刘善本退出内战
    揭露蒋介石谋害爱子高志航经过
    【新华社东北二十二日电】前国民党空军第四大队队长高志航之母高老太太，顷号召国民党空军人员立即退出内战，不要再为蒋介石送命。她对记者说，她的儿子是被蒋介石谋害而死的。高志航是东北人，深具民族自尊心，不满蒋介石利用空军屠杀同胞。在抗战开始时，蒋介石屡次阴谋暗害他，均未成功。一九三七年秋，敌机炸南周家口时，蒋嫡系空军事先不把情报通知高志航，嗣敌机来袭，逼他应战。高志航尚未起飞，即被炸死。高老太太痛惜其子之死，并望志航生前友好同事和学生学习刘善本的义举，积极起来反对内战。高老太太今年六十五岁，自东北解放后受民主政府多方照顾，她的第五个儿子已参加民主政府工作。
