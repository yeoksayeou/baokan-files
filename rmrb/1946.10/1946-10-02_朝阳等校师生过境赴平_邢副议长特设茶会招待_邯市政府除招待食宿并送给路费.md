Teachers and Students from Chaoyang and Other Schools Pass Through on Their Way to Beiping; Vice Chairman Xing Hosts a Special Tea Party
Handan Municipal Government Provides Accommodation, Food, and Travel Expenses
Facts Speak Louder Than Words
"The Liberated Area Is Indeed Bright"
The Kuomintang's Shameless Rumors Go Bankrupt
[Our Newspaper Handan News] In recent days, a total of 289 students from various places in Sichuan and Gansu passed through Handan on their way to Beiping to resume their studies. On the 12th of this month, there were 30 students including Zhang Shifei from Chaoyang College; on the 15th, there were 31 students including Gu Zhimin from Chaoyang College, and 5 students including Yang Tisheng from the Ministry of Education's University Preparatory Class; on the 19th, there were 186 students led by Mr. Xu Yingchao, a professor from the Physical Education Department of Normal College, from Northwest Normal College, including Deng Zhenqing, 30 students including Xu Disheng from Beiping Normal College, 2 from Northeast University, 1 from Fu Jen Catholic University, 1 from the Conservatory of Music, 1 from Northwest Medical College, 1 from Northwest Institute of Technology, and 1 from the Normal Department of Hebei Provincial Middle School. When each group of students arrived in Handan, the Border Region Relief Association and the Municipal Government sent people to greet them. In addition to paying for the hotel room fees, the second group of students was also helped with 72,000 Jichaobi [currency in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region] because of insufficient travel expenses. Vice Chairman Xing of the Border Region also hosted a tea party to welcome them. At the welcoming banquet, the students requested an introduction to the anti-Japanese construction work in the Liberated Areas. Vice Chairman Xing said: "We don't have any special skills. Our ability is to practice democracy and honestly serve the people, so the people support us. We relied on the people to persist in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and completed the democratic construction of the Liberated Areas." Vice Chairman Xing explained the spirit and essence of democratic politics, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and mobilizing the masses, and emphasized the basic position of opposing civil war and demanding peace and democracy. While listening to Vice Chairman Xing's speech, they nodded frequently. Then one student said, "No wonder after we arrived in the Liberated Areas, we didn't see a single idle person, nor did we see a single beggar." Student representative ××× said: "Before we came to the Liberated Areas, everyone was very afraid, thinking that we would be subject to strict inspections and encounter many difficulties, but we have not been inspected once, and we can come and go very freely. Even if we stay in the villages of the Liberated Areas at night, the problems of housing and food are quickly solved. The people along the way prepared tea for us, which was really beyond our expectations. Today, we are even more pleased to be hosted by Vice Chairman Xing, and we would like to thank you on behalf of the students." Student ×× said: "In the Kuomintang areas, they spread rumors that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army were murderers and arsonists, practiced communism of wives, and had 'scissor teams' and 'smelling teams,' which made us very afraid. We didn't even dare to wear good clothes. Today, we have seen with our own eyes that the Liberated Areas are the brightest places." Student ×× said: "When we were about to leave, a Kuomintang commissioner repeatedly advised us, 'It's really dangerous for you to go to the Liberated Areas! It's better to take a detour.' What we have seen with our own eyes is completely different." Another student stood up and said: "To be honest, I didn't believe the Kuomintang's deceptive propaganda before. I always thought that if the Communist Party was really like what they said, they would have destroyed themselves long ago. Why are the Kuomintang still disarming the Eighth Route Army one division after another?" Another student said: "The people in the Great Rear Area dare not speak, but the people here are very free and live happily. I asked an old man, and he said that the Eighth Route Army doesn't beat people, doesn't scold people, and is fair in doing things, and also helps us to stand up and have food to eat." A student said very naively: "When we arrive in Beiping, we will write to our families and friends and say, don't worry, we are doing well and safely through the Liberated Areas." A female student said: "Look at Vice Chairman Xing wearing coarse cloth clothes and not even taking guards with him when he goes out. This is really different from the Kuomintang areas, where they are under martial law all day long, and officials take many guards and attendants with them when they take a step." In the evening, five or six students asked to stay in the Liberated Areas to study or work. Vice Chairman Xing said: "Students should have the freedom to study, but you are all resuming school, and it may hinder the school rules if you stay individually in the Liberated Areas. Please complete the transfer procedures before coming again, and we guarantee that you will have books to read, food to eat, clothes to wear, and work to do." They were both grateful and embarrassed, and were reluctant to part when they said goodbye, almost shedding tears. On the morning of the 21st, the Relief Association sent people to take care of them along the way and sent them all the way to Yuanshi Border Area.

　　朝阳等校师生过境赴平  邢副议长特设茶会招待
    邯市政府除招待食宿并送给路费
    事实胜雄辩
    “解放区原来很光明”
    国民党无耻谣言破产
    【本报邯郸讯】近几日由四川、甘肃各地经邯郸赴北平复学的学生共有二百八十九人之多，计本月十二日有朝阳学院学生张识非等三十人；十五日有朝阳学院学生古治民等三十一人，教育部大学先修班学生杨梯生等五人；十九日有由师范学院体育系教授徐英超先生率领西北师范学院学生邓振清等一百八十六人，北平师范学院学生徐迪生等三十人，东北大学二人，辅仁大学一人，音乐学院一人，西北医学院一人，西北工学院一人，河北省立中学师范部一人等。每批学生到达邯郸时，均由边区救济分会、市政府派人招待，除旅馆房钱代付外，第二批学生因路费不足，还帮助冀钞七万二千元，边区邢副议长并设茶会欢迎。在欢迎席上，学生要求介绍解放区的抗敌建设工作。邢副议长说：“我们没有什么长处，我们的本领就是实行民主，老老实实给老百姓办事，所以老百姓就拥护我们。我们依靠老百姓坚持了八年多的抗日战争，完成了解放区的民主建设事业。”邢副议长并将民主政治与减租减息发动群众的精神与实质加以说明，更着重指出反对内战要求和平民主的基本立场。他们在听邢副议长谈话时，均频频点首，接着有位学生说：“无怪我们到解放区后，没见一个闲人，也没见一个讨饭吃的。”学生代表×××说：“我们未到解放区之前，大家很害怕，以为定要受到严格的检查，遇到很多的困难，可是并没有受过一次检查，很自由的来来往往。即便天晚住到解放区的乡村里，住房和吃饭问题，也很快的解决了。沿途老百姓都给我们预备茶水，这真出乎意料之外。今天更蒙邢副议长招待，我们更觉得非常高兴，特代表同学们谢谢。”学生××说：“在国民党地区，造谣宣传共产党八路军杀人放火，共产共妻，还有‘剪子队’，‘闻香队’，使我们很害怕，我们连好衣服都不敢穿在身上。今天亲眼所见，原来解放区是最光明的地方。”××学生说：“我们临来时，国民党的一个专员还再三劝我们，‘你们到解放区去可真危险呀！不如绕道走好。’现在所亲眼见到的真是完全不同了。”另一位学生站起来说：“说实话，我以前就不相信国民党那些欺骗宣传，我总以为共产党如果真和他们宣传的一样，也早就自己灭亡了，为什么国民党现在还一师一师的给八路军缴械呢？”又一位学生说：“大后方的老百姓不敢说话，这里的老百姓都很自由，高高兴兴的过日子。我问了一个老百姓，他说八路军不打人，不骂人，作事公平，还叫我们翻身有饭吃”。一位学生很天真的说：“我们到北平时，给家庭和朋友写信说，你们不要担心了，我们经过解放区是很好很平安的。”一位女生说：“你看邢副议长穿着粗布衣服，出门连护兵也不带，这给国民党地方整天戒严，官长走一步路带着许多护兵马弁，真不相同啊。”到了晚上，有五六位学生要求留在解放区求学或工作。邢副议长说：“学生应有求学的自由，但你们是学校全体复学，个别留在解放区恐有碍学校规则，请你们办妥转学手续再来，那我们保证有书读、有饭吃、有衣穿、有工作。”他们又感激又为难，握别时依依不舍，几乎掉下泪来。二十一日早晨，仍由救济分会派人沿途照料，一直送往元氏边地。
