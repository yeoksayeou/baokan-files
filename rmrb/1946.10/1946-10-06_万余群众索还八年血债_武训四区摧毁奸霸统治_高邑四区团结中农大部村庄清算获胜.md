　　Over Ten Thousand People Demand Repayment of Eight Years of Blood Debt
　　Fourth District of Wuxun Destroys Tyrannical Rule of Traitors and Bullies
　　Fourth District of Gaoyi United the Majority of Middle Peasants, Village Land Reform Achieves Victory
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, report] The anti-traitor and anti-bully movement in the Fourth District of Wuxun is unfolding vigorously. So far, 42 villages and 15,000 people have been involved in the struggle, completely crushing the rule of traitors and bullies. The losses suffered by the masses over the years have been compensated, and the land they deserved has been recovered. For the past eight or nine years, this district has suffered from the heavy oppression and exploitation of enemies, puppets, diehards, and bullies, and its people have long been impoverished and destitute. After the Anti-Japanese War, the puppet Wu Ni Lianjie arrived in the area and, under the guise of organizing a volunteer army, engaged in banditry and collaboration, forcibly conscripting more than 3,000 soldiers and seizing more than 3,000 mu of land from the masses. In addition to exploiting the masses with high rents, the evil landlords colluded with Wu Ni to persecute the masses and engage in corruption for their own benefit. Over the past seven or eight years, more than 3,000 innocent people in the district have been forced to death, assassinated, buried alive, or shot by enemies, puppets, traitors, and bullies. Last autumn, the district was liberated, and this spring, a universal rent reduction, interest reduction, and wage increase movement was carried out, with 200 workers and 150 tenant households initially reaping the benefits. Recently, a vigorous anti-traitor and anti-bully movement was launched. First, in Liulin Town, the puppet regiment commander Yang Ni Guangrun and the evil bully Zhao Minzhai and 14 others were overthrown. In Hougu Town, the two major evil bullies, the Huang family, who called themselves "emperors," and the Liu family, who called themselves "military advisors," were also defeated one after another. The masses said, "Now it is our turn to rule the world!" After the victory of these several key points of the movement, it immediately promoted the entire district, crushed the rule of traitors and diehards, and suppressed the sabotage of special agents. The masses recovered many of the spoils that had been extorted. The mass movement is now nearing its end, and the fruits are being cleared, the various mass organizations are being reorganized, and the village governments are being transformed.
　　[Our newspaper, Changzhi, report] In the Fourth District of Gaoyi, most villages have been involved in a thorough land reform movement, and the farmers' land problems have been largely resolved. In the past, the struggles in this district were often not thorough, resulting in traitors, special agents, and evil bullies still possessing a large amount of land and continuing to exploit the masses. After this struggle was launched, the middle and poor peasants united and thoroughly liquidated the traitors, special agents, and evil landlords, overthrowing 159 of them, accounting for two-thirds of their total number. The poor peasants in most villages recovered the land they had lost. This movement universally took care of the interests of the middle peasants, and the distribution of fruits was very broad. In Beipu Village, 160 out of 190 households received fruits, and the peasant ranks were further consolidated.
