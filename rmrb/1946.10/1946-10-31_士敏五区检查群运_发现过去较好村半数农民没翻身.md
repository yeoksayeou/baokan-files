　　Shi Min Fifth District Checks Mass Movement
    Discovers Half of Peasants in Previously Better Villages Have Not Turned Over
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng News] Cadres in the Fifth District of Shi Min recently inspected the implementation of "Land to the Tiller." In addition to a general inspection of ordinary villages, they paid special attention to inspecting Puyugou, which was previously considered more thorough. This gully had reduced rents as early as 1941, and 55 tenant farmers and 5 hired laborers had obtained 1,616 mu of land. However, the land problem in this village was not completely resolved. According to the investigation, among the 204 households in the entire gully, there are still 68 poor peasants who have not turned over, and 35 households have declined. In addition, 14 tenant farmers still do not have or lack arable land. This shows that the rent reduction and liquidation in Puyugou in the past were not thorough. The cadres then examined the reasons for the incompleteness and found: (1) The area is vast and the villages are scattered. Among the 75 natural villages, 22 have only one household, 9 have two households, 14 have three or four households, and the rest also have only ten or so households, making it difficult to go deeper. (2) The cadres have complacency and self-satisfaction. (3) Some village cadres are close to the landlords, and the masses have concerns. Although this has been corrected, the masses are still not bold. These situations have aroused great attention from the leadership and all cadres, and they are determined to immediately and vigorously implement "Land to the Tiller" so that peasants can obtain land.

　　士敏五区检查群运
    发现过去较好村半数农民没翻身
    【本报阳城讯】士敏五区干部顷检查耕者有其田的实行状况，除普遍检查一般村庄外，特别注意检查了过去认为较彻底的蒲峪沟。该沟在民国三十年即减过租，并有五十五户佃农及五户雇工得到一千六百一十六亩土地，但该村土地问题并未完全解决。据调查，全沟二百零四户中，仍有贫苦农民六十八户没有翻身，且有三十五户下降，另有十四户佃农，还没有或缺乏耕地，可见蒲峪沟过去的减租清算并不彻底。干部们随即检查不彻底的原因，发现：（一）地区辽阔，村庄分散。七十五个自然庄，一户占一个庄的有二十二个，两户者九个，三、四户者十四个，其余亦均为十来户者，因此深入较为困难。（二）干部有差不多思想及自满情绪。（三）有些村干部和地主接近，群众有顾虑，现虽已改正，群众仍不大胆。这些情况引起领导上及全体干部的极大注意，决心立即大力实现耕者有其田，使农民取得土地。
