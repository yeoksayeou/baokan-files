    U.S. Military Presence and Establishment of Bases in China Actually Threatens Peace in the Far East
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] Moscow Radio broadcast today: New Era Magazine published an article by Colonel Rachinov entitled "Foreign Troops Stationed in the Territory of Non-Enemy Countries," which stated: After the end of World War II, the United States continued to send its armed forces to non-enemy countries. It has a large military contingent stationed in China and has established extensive air force bases in Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places. It has also built naval bases in Qingdao and Shanghai. The headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Fleet is located in Qingdao. According to Xinmin Evening News, the United States has more than 30,000 Marines stationed in Qingdao. China is one of the five major powers and a permanent member of the Security Council. If Washington tries to explain the reason for the U.S. military presence in China, the Washington authorities will undoubtedly find it difficult. Due to the armed intervention of the United States, the flames of civil war in China are expanding daily. Wenhui Daily commented on the U.S. military presence in China, pointing out: (1) The United States has abandoned its mask and revealed its true face of armed interference in China's internal affairs. (2) The United States does not recognize China as an independent and sovereign country but regards China as it does the Philippines. (3) The United States is attempting to turn China into a military base for anti-Soviet operations. Under these circumstances, not only is civil war occurring in China, but the peace of the Far East may be actually threatened.

    美军驻华建立基地实际威胁远东和平
    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科今日广播：新时代杂志刊载拉奇诺夫上校一文，题为“驻前非敌国境内的外国军队一内称：美国在二次大战结束后，在非敌国境内，继续派自己的武装去，在中国驻有巨大兵团，并在北平、天津、青岛、上海、南京、重庆、成都、昆明等地建立广泛空军根据地，在青岛与上海并建有海军根据地，美海军第七舰队司令部即设在青岛。据新民晚报息，美国在青岛驻有海军陆战队三万余人。中国是五大强国之一，且是安理会常任理事国，如果华盛顿解释美军驻在中国的原因时，毫无疑义，华盛顿当局将会感觉困难。由于美国的武装干涉，中国内战火焰已在日益扩大了。文汇报评美军驻在中国时指出：（一）美国已抛弃假面具，露出武装干涉中国内政的真面目。（二）美国不承认中国是一个独立自主国家，而把中国看作菲律宾一样。（三）美国企图把中国变成反苏军事根据地。在这种情况下，不仅在中国发生内战，而且可能实际威胁远东和平。
