　　Comrade Wang Hongkun's Concluding Remarks
    Give Play to the Spirit of Active and Initiative Offense
    Firmly Establish the Determination for Long-Term and Arduous Struggle
    On the third day, Military Region Deputy Commander Comrade Wang Hongkun made concluding remarks. After praising the achievements of the struggle in various counties, he pointed out that we must greatly improve our preparedness for war on the basis of implementing land reform; and he particularly pointed out that in today's domestic situation, there are no other illusions, only resolute resistance to the reactionary派's offensive! Therefore, every cadre must deeply publicize to the masses: all work should be viewed from the perspective of long-term hardship. Regarding the development of mass self-defense guerrilla warfare, Deputy Commander Wang emphasized: everything must proceed from the spirit of active and initiative offense, defense and retreat will inevitably only lead to being beaten and to failure. He cited the experience of the anti-stubborn struggle in En County, Ji'nan and Ci County, Taihang, to illustrate: when the leading ideology in En County was in a state of defense and retreat, the entire county was beaten everywhere, a large number of cadres were massacred, and the middle elements among the masses generally broke away from us, or wavered and complained, causing most of the En County liberated area to suffer from蚕食. Later, the leadership quickly turned from passive to offensive, and the county party secretary and the county magistrate led the guerrilla corps to actively attack the enemy everywhere, launching an armed anti-espionage struggle, and the situation in En County changed for the better. Coupled with the cooperation of our army's outer-line self-defense operations, all the local stubborn elements and special agent armed forces in En County were quickly eliminated by us. The same was true in Ci County. When we were simply defending, special agent armed forces assassinated and looted everywhere, threatening militia rebellions. Later, the Ci County joint defense armed forces took the initiative to launch attacks, and the assassination incidents in the entire county quickly stopped, and the courage of the masses to defend themselves with arms was further enhanced. Finally, Deputy Commander Wang called on everyone: to quickly clear the fields; the militia of each county should continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of guerrilla warfare in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and when Chiang's army invades, widely launch sparrow warfare, landmine warfare, and tunnel warfare, actively attack the enemy, surround the enemy on points and lines, and create favorable conditions for the main force to annihilate them. Secondly, it is necessary to thoroughly implement the land reform movement, and on the basis of land reform, continue to arm the masses and prepare for guerrilla warfare. Third, each county should universally train the militia, reorganize the organization, and strengthen its political education to protect the interests of the masses who have turned over, especially the Party's leadership over it. Finally, in the leadership of various places, it is necessary to strengthen unity, strengthen unified leadership, immediately prepare for war, and be ready at any time to give the invading reactionaries a head-on blow!

　　王宏坤同志总结发言
    发挥积极主动进攻精神
    坚定长期艰苦斗争决心
    第三日，军区副司令员王宏坤同志总结发言。他于赞扬各县斗争成绩之后，并指出必须在贯彻土地改革的基础上大大提高我们的备战工作；并特别指出今天的国内形势，没有其他可以幻想，只有坚决抵抗反动派进攻！因之，每个干部必须深入向群众宣传：一切工作都应从长期艰苦方面着眼。对于开展群众自卫游击战争，王副司令员强调指出：一切必须从积极主动进攻的精神出发，防御与退却，必然只有挨打和失败。他引证了冀南恩县太行磁县反顽斗争的经验说明：当恩县领导思想上处于防御与退却时，全县即处处挨打，大批干部被屠杀，群众中间分子普遍脱离我们，或动摇埋怨，使恩县解放区大部遭受蚕食。以后领导上迅速由被动转为进攻，县委书记与县长领导着游击兵团，到处主动打击敌人，展开了武装反特斗争，恩县局面即为之改观。加以我军外线自卫作战胜利的配合，恩县全部土顽及特务武装即迅速为我消灭。在磁县也是一样，当我们单纯防御时，特务武装即到处暗杀抢掠，威胁民兵叛变，后来磁县联防武装主动进行了出击，全县暗杀事情，即迅速停止，群众武装自卫的勇气则更加增强。最后，王副司令员号召大家：迅速空室清野；各县民兵应继续发扬八年抗战中游击战争的光荣传统，在蒋军侵入时广泛展开麻雀战、地雷战、地道战，主动进攻敌人，把敌人围困于点线上，给主力军创造歼灭的有利条件。其次，要彻底贯彻土地改革运动，从土地改革的基础上，去继续武装群众，准备游击战争。第三，各县应普遍训练民兵，整理组织，加强其保护群众翻身利益的政治教育，特别是党对他的领导。最后，在各地领导上，要加强团结，加强一元化的领导，立即准备好战争，随时准备给进犯的反动派以迎头痛击！
