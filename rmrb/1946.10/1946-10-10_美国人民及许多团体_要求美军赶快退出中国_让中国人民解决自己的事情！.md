Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: TASS, New York, 6th: The National Council for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy announced that many religious leaders and groups are writing to request the U.S. military to withdraw from China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: New York Airmail: Since August, the call for "Withdrawal from China" within the United States has been increasing. The U.S. New Masses Weekly published an article by Fuld on August 13, strongly advocating that the U.S. military must withdraw from Chinese territory, all secret or public loans must be stopped immediately, and China must be returned to the Chinese people, who alone can decide the organization of the government and the method of establishing the government. The article called on the American people to completely change the government's policy, and that public gatherings and parades should focus on this point. Protests should also be continuously lodged with the White House, the State Department, the Navy, and the Army. We must not let any candidate forget the China issue, which will be one of the many conditions voters use to test their abilities as politicians.

An editorial in The Nation magazine called for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, stating: "As long as U.S. troops are still 'defending railroads' and U.S. ships are still importing supplies, the Chiang government will not abandon its long-held goal of 'a China under a centralized government supported by American arms, American loans, and American-equipped armies.' We have now reached a point where the best thing we should do is nothing and withdraw from China quickly."

Letters to the editor of the New York Herald Tribune opposed American armed intervention in China. Spencer Monnapp, who once served as a professor at a university in Chengdu, wrote: "The use of weapons and loans by the American armed forces in China to support the Kuomintang and its army makes politically-minded Chinese people more convinced that the Communist Party is right and the Kuomintang is wrong." He said: "We underestimate the Chinese people's sentiment of patriotism." Reader Bessel wrote: "You say there are two groups of people who advocate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, one is the Chinese liberals, and the other is the Chinese Communist Party, but as we see it, there is another important group of people who are demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, and they are the American people." He said: "If the idea of withdrawing U.S. troops from China is implemented, I guarantee that the majority of the American people will support and approve it." Writer Allen advocated, "Let the Chinese people solve their own problems!" In addition, many Americans living in China have written to their friends in the United States about the facts they have witnessed. The New York Evening Post disclosed such letters, one of which read: "Speaking of interfering in internal affairs, I don't want to write too much. No country's sovereignty has been harmed by the United States to the extent that China's has. We have aroused the Chinese people's spirit of nationalism."

专栏：要求美军退出中国

　　美国人民及许多团体
    要求美军赶快退出中国
    让中国人民解决自己的事情！
    【新华社延安七日电】塔斯社纽约六日电：美全国争取和平委员会及远东民主政策委员会宣告，有许多宗教领袖及团体，正在函请美军退出中国。
    【新华社延安六日电】纽约航讯：八月以来，美国内“退出中国”的呼声日益增高，美国新群众周刊八月十三日载弗尔德一文，力主美军必须退出中国的土地，所有秘密或公开的借款必须立刻停止，中国必须归还中国人民，只有他们才能决定政府的组织和政府成立的方法。该文号召美国人民均要使政府完全变更政策，民众的集会游行都应该以这一点作为中心。还应不断的向白宫国务院海军和陆军提出抗议，我们不能让任何一个竞选者忘记了中国问题，这将是选民用来试验他当政治家的能力的许多条件之一。
    民族杂志社论呼吁在华美军赶快退出中国称：“一天美军还在‘保卫铁路’，一天美船还在输入物资，蒋政府就一天不放弃久已期望的目标，即‘一个在由美国军火、美国贷款以及美式装备的军队支持的集权政府之下的中国’。我们现在已经临到了这样一个关头，现在我们最应当作的事情就是什么也不作，赶快退出中国。”
    纽约先驱论坛报的读者投书该报，反对美国武装干涉中国，曾经任成都某大学教授的司本塞蒙纳普叶称：“美国武装军队在华利用武器与借款支持国民党和军队，使具有政治头脑的中国人民更加相信共产党是对的，国民党是错的。”他说：我们对中国爱国主义的情绪估计的太低。读者贝色尔写道：“你们谈有两派人主张驻华美军撤退，一派是中国的自由主义者，一派是中国共产党，但照我们看来，另外有一派重要的人在要求撤退在华美军，他们是美国人民。”他说：“如果把撤退在华美军的意见实行起来，我保证大多数美国人民会支持赞成的。”作家爱伦力主“让中国人民解决自己的事情吧”！此外许多留在中国的美侨，曾将他们目睹的事实函告在美友人。纽约下午报曾披露此类函件，其中一封写着：“谈到干涉内政吧，我不愿多写，没有一个国家的主权被美国略害到中国这样的地步，我们已激起了中国人民的民族主义精神”。
