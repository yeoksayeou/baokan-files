　　Woman Labor Hero Hao Erman
    Sends Letter to Chairman Yang Reporting Good Times
    [Our Special Dispatch:] Hao Erman, a first-class woman labor hero and border region councilor from the Taihang District, recently sent a letter to Chairman Yang of the Border Government, reporting on her production achievements for the year. Although the harvest was reduced due to natural disasters, she still managed to achieve "cultivating two and surplus one." The letter stated: "We met once in March, and it's been many days since we last saw each other. I hope you are healthy and your work is going smoothly. This year's production is very good here, but on August 20th, the cold weather froze the millet, beans, and buckwheat. My production this year is better than last year, although some was damaged by the cold. However, I planned and managed to achieve 'cultivating two and surplus one,' and production is very good. I hope you will continue to help us more in the future. Furthermore, the mass movement here has now distributed the fruits. The old liberated areas already had a high level of awareness, and after this movement, the masses have been thoroughly liberated, gained benefits, and achieved having land to cultivate (note: meaning 'land to the tiller'). I will tell you about the general situation. I hope you will give us more guidance. The village and district cadres have been of great help to me. Don't worry about me." Chairman Yang Rong was very happy after receiving Hao's letter and replied, saying: "We are very happy that you have achieved 'cultivating two and surplus one' this year. Although some crops were frozen to death due to the cold weather, we believe that you will find a way to overcome this, just as you did in past famine years. We hope you will work even harder to lead everyone to turn over and engage in production and live a good life. You have worked very hard, and we extend our respects." (Xiushan)

　　女劳动英雄郝二蛮
    函杨主席报告好时光
    【本报特讯：】太行区一等妇女劳动英雄边区参议员郝二蛮氏，日前致函边府杨主席，报告她一年的生产成绩，虽因天灾减少收成，但已达到耕二余一，信称：“三月开会见面一次，多日没见面，我问你身体健康，工作顺利？今年生产我们这里年成很好，就是八月二十日天冷，把谷子豆子荞麦都冷死了。我今年生产比去年强，也是天气冷坏了一些，不过我计划了一下，能作到耕二余一，生产很好。今后还希望你们多多帮助。再者，我们这里现在群运分了果实，原来老区就觉悟高，经过这次运动，群众彻底翻身，得到利益，做到有地种（按：即耕者有其田）。大概情况就给你谈这些，希你多多指导，村区干部对我帮助很大，勿念。”杨戎主席接到郝氏信后很高兴，当复函称：“你今年做到耕二余一，我们很高兴，虽因天冷冻死一部庄稼，我们想你们会像过去荒年一样，有办法渡过，希望你更加努力领导大家翻身生产，过好日子，你们很辛苦，特致敬意”。（秀山）
