　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Manila News: The Philippine Senate recently passed the third anti-Chinese law—the Retail Trade Nationalization Act. This law stipulates that the Philippines shall have preferential rights to control in the retail industry. So far, the Philippines has completed the final step in excluding the interests of most of the 160,000 overseas Chinese. The first Public Market Nationalization Act passed in late August had already excluded thousands of overseas Chinese from Philippine public markets. The second Labor Nationalization Act passed in mid-September stipulates that 60% of the employees of any foreign enterprise, company, or store must be Filipinos, which has forced tens of thousands of overseas Chinese employees to be dismissed from enterprises and stores operated by overseas Chinese. The recently passed third Retail Trade Nationalization Act has further plunged tens of thousands of overseas Chinese, who account for 80% of Philippine retailers, into bankruptcy. The complete passage of the above three laws has excluded most of the interests of our overseas Chinese in the Philippines. As early as July, all sectors of the Philippine Chinese community appealed to Gan Naiguang, the special envoy of the Chiang Kai-shek government to the Philippines, to request the Nanjing government to take steps to stop the Philippine authorities from taking such anti-Chinese measures, but the latter ignored them. Chiang Kai-shek's act of ignoring the interests of our overseas Chinese has aroused the indignation of the overseas Chinese on the Philippine Islands.

　　菲又通过排华法案
    我侨胞利益被排除殆尽
    蒋政府对此竟置若罔闻
    【新华社延安三日电】马尼拉讯：菲参院于日前通过第三个排华法案——零售商菲化法案。该法案规定菲律宾在零售业中获统制特惠权。至此，菲律滨已完成排斥我十六万华侨大部利益的最后步骤。八月下旬通过的第一个公共市场菲化法案，已将数千华侨从菲公共市场被排斥出来。九月中旬通过的第二个劳工菲化法案，规定任何外国人的企业公司和商店，其职工百分之六十必须是菲人，这使数万华侨职工从华侨经营之企业商店内被迫解雇。最近通过之第三个零售商菲化法案，更使据有菲零售商百分之八十的数万华侨陷于破产之境。以上三法案之全部通过，使我侨胞在菲之利益被排除大半。早在七月间，菲华侨各界即向蒋介石政府赴菲特使甘乃光吁请南京政府采取步骤。阻止菲当局此种排华措施，但后者竟置不理。蒋介石此种漠视我侨胞利益之举，已引起菲岛侨胞之义愤。
