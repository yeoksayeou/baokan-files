Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: TASS Paris Dispatch: The most important result of the French referendum passing the constitution is the end to the period of the provisional government, which threw France's political and economic life into chaos and placed French democracy in great danger. An editorial in *L'Humanité* stated: "This is a victory for the republican system, a victory for the spirit of awareness and democratic unity over the conspiracies promoting individual power, and France's international prestige will increase."

In the referendum vote, the percentage of abstentions was large, the majority of whom were supporters of the Popular Republican Movement (MRP); they did not follow the call of the party leader to vote in favor, but at the same time did not vote against. If the voters of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement had all responded to the call of the three parties, according to official estimates, the number of those voting in favor would have reached 13 million, but in reality only 9 million did so. Specifically: In areas where the Communist Party has strong political influence, most voted in favor, with very few abstentions. Even in the large industrial centers, the number of voters responding to the Communist Party's call increased. However, in areas where the Socialist Party and especially the Popular Republican Movement are dominant, a large proportion of voters in both parties left those two parties. According to local statistics, of the 5.5 million voters who voted for the Popular Republican Movement in the June election, only 2 million voted in favor of the constitution. Many supporters of the Popular Republican Movement had close ties with de Gaulle in the past, and the party leader has apparently not yet given up hope of re-approaching de Gaulle. The party's newspaper, *L'Aube*, stated: The constitution has been passed, but the road to revision has not been cut off. The results of this referendum indicate that there will be a bitter struggle in the November election of the National Assembly; what lies before the democratic forces in France is an important and arduous test.

　　新宪法复决通过结果
    法国混乱政局澄清
    但选国民议会时仍将有苦斗
    【新华社延安十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国复决通过宪法之当前最重要的结果，就是结束了使法国政治经济生活混乱，结束了使法国民主陷于非常险境的临时政府时期。人道报社论称：“这是共和制度的胜利，是觉悟与民主团结精神对提倡个人权力阴谋的胜利，法国的国际威望将增高。”
    在复决投票中，弃权的百分比很大，当中大多数是人民共和运动党的拥护者；他们没有遵照该党领袖的号召去投赞成票，但同时也没有投反对票，如果共产党社会党及人民共和运动党的选民都响应三党号召，据官方估计投赞成票者当达一千三百万人，但实际上只有九百万人这样作。分别来说：在共产党有强大政治影响的地区，大部投赞成票，弃权很少。甚至在大工业中心响应共产党的号召的选民数量还有所增长。但在社会党尤其是人民共和运动党占优势的地区，两党的很大一部分选民则离开该两党。据此间人士统计，在六月大选中曾投票选举人民共和运动党的五百五十万选民中，只有二百万人投票赞成宪法。许多人民共和运动党的拥护者在过去与戴高乐有密切联系，而该党领袖也显然迄未放弃重新与戴高乐接近的希望。该党机关报《奥德》称：宪法是通过了，但修改之路还没有断绝。这次复决结果，表示十一月选举国民议会时将有一场苦斗；摆在法国民主势力面前的，是重要而艰难的考验。
