　　The Unyielding People of Chengde
　　Huashan
　　The first Chiang troops to invade the Chengde urban area were a "special task force" of over 300 men from Shi Jue's unit. They were a group of traitors and puppet soldiers who had been riding high on the Pingjin line for many years, lackeys and running dogs of the enemy and the puppets. They held American pistols, smoked American cigarettes, and rode roughshod over the people of Chengde with great fanfare.

　　When they discovered they had entered a completely empty city, thoroughly cleared and fortified, and that the masses were watching them with silent hostility, they couldn't help but feel apprehensive. The "special task force" tempted the people by saying, "Turn in a landmine and get a reward of one thousand Manchurian notes." But week after week passed, and no one handed over a single landmine.

　　The people of Chengde knew how to "welcome" the "Second Manchus." They tore down all the doors, windows, ceilings, floorboards, beams, and even the wooden strips embedded in false walls of all public housing to burn and cook with. When asked, "If Chiang Kai-shek's army comes and has no housing, won't they kill you?" they would unanimously answer, "They can't kill us all in the daytime; we'll deal with them at night, and we will certainly not let the 'Second Manchus' find a place to live."

　　It wasn't until the third day that the third regiment of the Chiang army entered the city. They made every effort to find civilian houses to live in and searched for respectable young women. Despite the "Second Manchus" collecting grain and raising funds, the Chiang army still looted houses everywhere like bandits. Because the railway couldn't transport enough food, the Chiang army often forcibly demanded food from civilian homes. The long-hidden spies and traitors reappeared, and all the big shots, lackeys, and running dogs from the "Manchukuo" era were back on stage.

　　Although there were numerous sentry posts in the suburbs, people kept escaping from the city to the liberated areas. When the Eighth Route Army withdrew, the male and female actors of the Chengde City Old Art Glory Ascension Troupe didn't quite understand, saying, "The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are both Chinese; whoever comes, we'll just perform." But when the "Second Manchus" came and harassed the women and demanded things, they couldn't stay any longer. As they fled to the Luan River, thirty-five miles west of the city, they were shot at by the Chiang army, killing several people. Many fell into the river, but they continued to run outwards, saying, "Even if we die, we will find the Eighth Route Army."

　　After being harmed by the "Second Manchu" army for less than a month, the people of Chengde recalled two folk rhymes from the "Manchukuo" era: "Golden Chaoyang, Silver Chifeng, Chengde is a big hole." They missed the Eighth Route Army, and every day people ran out of the city to look for them. When they saw this group of soldiers who loved the people and defended the country—the Eighth Route Army soldiers—they said wholeheartedly, "Now we have hope of living! Even if it's right here! To take it back, let's fight back together!"

　　不屈服的承德人民
    华山
    首先侵入承德市区的蒋军，是石觉所部三百多人的“特工队”。他们是平锦线上得意多年的一群汉奸伪军，敌伪狗腿组成的，他们持着美国手枪吸着美国香烟，又威风凛凛骑在承德市民头上了。
    当他们发觉进入的是一座彻底坚壁清野的空城，群众都看着敌意默然注视他们的时候，不禁心战胆寒起来。“特工队”诱惑地向老百姓说：“挖出一枚地雷赏满洲票一千元。”但是一周二周的过去了，没有人交出一颗地雷来。
    承德人民是知道怎样“欢迎”“二满洲”的，他们把所有公共住宅的门窗、天花板、楼板、梁柱甚至嵌在假墙里的木条全部拆去烧了饭吃，有人问：“蒋介石军来了没房住不杀你们哩？”他们会一致的回答：“他白天杀不完，我们黑夜就搞他，一定不使“二满洲”找到住处。”
    蒋家军第三个团第三天才开到城里，他们尽找民房居住，并且寻找良家淑女。尽管“二满洲”征粮起款，蒋家军还是强盗一样到处抢家劫舍；铁路运不来粮食，蒋家军常到民家强要饭吃。隐藏多时的特务汉奸又出头露面了，“满洲国”时代的大小红人和爪牙狗腿全又粉墨登场。
    虽然市郊的岗哨重重，但是不断的有人从市区逃到解放区。当八路军撤离时，承德市旧艺荣升班子的男女演员们还不太了解的说：“国民党共产党一样是中国人，谁来不是唱戏。”但是“二满洲”来了搞女人要东西，弄得他们待不下去，他们逃到城西三十五里滦河时，被蒋军扫射打死了几个人，好些人落到河中，但是他们还往外跑，并且说：“死了也要找八路军。”
    被“二满洲”军害不到一月的承德，人民又回忆起“满洲国”两句民谣来了：“金朝阳，银赤峰，承德是个大窟窿。”他们怀念八路军，每天都有人跑出城来找寻八路军，当他们一见这批爱民卫国的战士——八路军子弟兵时，他们同心的说：“这可就有我们活的啦！尽管就在这里呵！要回咱们一齐打回去！”
