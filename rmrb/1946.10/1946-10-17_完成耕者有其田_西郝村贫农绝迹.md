　　Completing "Land to the Tiller"
    Poor Peasants Vanish from West Hao Village
    [Report from Cixian by Our Newspaper] After several months of land reform movement in West Hao Village, Cixian County, the feudal bully rule has been thoroughly crushed, and the goal of "land to the tiller" has been achieved. In the past, the village's nine landlord households possessed 1,862 mu of good land, averaging 30 mu per person; while 117 poor peasant households had only 1,395 mu of meager land, averaging only 2.5 mu per person, and 28 extremely poor households had no land to cultivate. After the land reform movement, only two classes remain in the village: 13 rich peasant households, possessing 783 mu of land, averaging 11 mu per person; and 204 middle peasant households, possessing 5,004 mu of land, averaging 4.8 mu per person. The parasitic landlord class and the poor and extremely poor peasants who labored but could not eat have all disappeared. In order to achieve land reform, the peasants of the village waged a long-term struggle against treacherous bully landlords. As early as 1942, they organized the "Two-Household Cooperative" to settle accounts with the treacherous bully landlords, but it was suppressed by reactionary forces. After liberation, they immediately reorganized and carried out a rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement, achieving considerable success. However, due to the lack of a clear direction from the leadership, they dared not let go, so the struggle was not thorough. Once the movement was over, the treacherous bully landlords bribed village cadres, released major traitors, spread rumors to threaten the masses, and restored their actual rule. This time, under the clear slogan of "realizing land to the tiller," and after several more intense and complex struggles, the bully landlord Liu Changlin and others were thoroughly defeated, and the peasants have become the masters of their own land.

　　完成耕者有其田
    西郝村贫农绝迹
    【本报磁县讯】磁县西郝村经过几个月土地改革运动，现已彻底摧垮封建恶霸统治，实现了耕者有其田。过去该村九户地主占有好地一千八百六十二亩，每人平均三十亩；而一百一十七户贫农仅有薄地一千三百九十五亩，每人平均只有二亩半，二十八户赤贫则无地可种。经过土地改革运动，该村已只剩了两个阶层：富农十三户，有地七百八十三亩，每人平均十一亩；中农二百零四户，土地五千零四亩，每人平均四亩八分；寄生的地主阶级与劳动而不得食的贫农与赤贫均已绝迹。该村农民为实现土地改革，曾对奸霸地主进行长期斗争，民国三十一年即曾组织过“二户社”，与奸霸地主算账，但被反动势力镇压下去了。解放后，立即重振旗鼓，进行减租增资运动，并取得相当成绩。但因领导上没有明确方针，不敢放手，以至斗争不彻底，运动一过去，奸霸地主即收买村干部，放跑大汉奸，造谣威胁群众，恢复了实际的统治。这次在明确的实现耕者有其田口号下，又经过多次剧烈复杂的斗争，始将恶霸地主刘长林等彻底击垮，农民已成为自己土地的主人。（联合办公室）
