　　Blood Debt!
    Jiang Planes Bomb Zhangyuan Residents Madly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th] Today, sixteen American-made Jiang planes in two batches attacked Zhangjiakou. The first batch of four planes intruded into the city's airspace at 8:00 AM, circling for reconnaissance. At 12:00 PM, another twelve planes in different directions sneaked into the city's airspace to wreak havoc for three hours, dropping over a hundred bombs. Peaceful residents suffered some casualties. Ma Dengrong, from the Fifth District, wrapped the remains of her young son in a quilt. Although her father did not want her to see it, she suddenly pulled out her beloved son, who had been bombed into several pieces, and cried uncontrollably, saying: "This is a blood debt, this is a blood debt!" An old man from Doushan Street in the First District mourned his deceased relatives and said bitterly: "Jiang Jieshi, you bandit! Even though I am old, I will see your end! Will the common people let you get away with this?!" When the Jiang planes bombed, the city's military police, citizens, and worker pickets worked bravely, and order was maintained. As soon as the air raid alarm was lifted, fires were extinguished, and electricity and telephone lines were repaired by evening. Mayor Yang Chunpu and Communist Party City Committee Secretary Liu Xiufeng personally led cadres from the urban districts to visit and comfort the affected citizens, and purchased coffins to bury the dead.

    蒋机狂炸张垣居民
    【新华社张家口九日电】今日美制蒋机十六架分两批袭张。首批四架于上午八时侵入市空，盘旋侦察，十二时又有十二架分途窜入市空肆虐，历三小时，投弹百余枚，和平居民略有伤亡。五区马登荣之妻以被子裹其幼子残骸，虽其父亦不令看见，但突对记者将其被炸成数截的爱子抽出，泣不成声的说：“这是血债，这是血债呀！”一区窦善街一老者悲悼其死难亲属，恨恨地说：“蒋介石这贼子！我虽老了，也要看看你的下场！老百姓难道肯和你甘休吗？！”蒋机轰炸时，全市军警市民工人纠察队奋勇工作，秩序有条不紊。警报一解除，各处火患即告扑灭，电灯电话线路傍晚亦告修复。杨春圃市长及中共市委书记刘秀峰亲率市区干部逐街逐户抚问被难市民，并购棺收殓死者。
