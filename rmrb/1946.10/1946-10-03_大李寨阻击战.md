　　The Dali Village Blocking Action
    Luo Feng
    The night of September 5th was a night of thunderous cannon fire shaking the earth. The entire Third Division, which had been sent to encircle and suppress General Li Xiannian from Suixian and Zaoyang in northern Hubei, had already occupied Tianye Temple, attempting to invade my Dongming area.

    They were filled with "confidence in victory" and an "arrogant" demeanor, having loudly proclaimed "sweeping from the mountains to the plains." However, after this night of fighting, their "confidence" in victory was shaken, and they prepared to flee.

    After breakfast on September 6th, our army's ×× unit received a report that "the enemy at Tianye Temple had broken through and fled." We immediately led the troops out. The comrades' fighting spirit and firm determination to annihilate the enemy immediately became like a tightly stretched bowstring, waiting for an opportunity to pounce like a tiger descending from the mountain.

    Time flew by, and the actions of our commanders and fighters kept pace with time. According to the deployment, they occupied their positions, some attacking, some encircling, some cutting off the waist, and some blocking the head. Before long, a burst of gunfire echoed across the dense green fields, mixed with shouts of slogans: "Welcome Third Division brothers to lay down your arms and come over!" "The Eighth Route Army treats prisoners leniently, no killing of prisoners!"

    At this time, the tanks were moving. Zhang Qinrong, the deputy company commander of the Ninth Company, led a platoon to block the tanks carrying terrified souls. The lively, clever, and consistently brave soldier Zhao Xiaohua was the first to climb onto a tank. However, even after climbing up, he could not kill the enemy, and the tank continued to move on the ground. Xiaohua tapped on the turtle shell with his grenade, shouting: "Hey, hey, come out and surrender, and you won't be killed!" But there was no response from inside.

    Comrade Zhang Qinrong arrived and quickly grabbed a grenade, throwing it at the glass of the tank's observation hole. The tank stopped immediately, and the tank behind it obediently stopped as well. Soldiers Liu Zhenhua and Qiu Zhengshun of the Sixth Company, under the leadership of squad leader Zhang Tuan'en, also rushed up and used grenades to break the tracks, solving the problem of two more tanks.

    Trucks arrived, and as soon as the grenades exploded, the enemy immediately got out.

    Light, nimble jeeps sped through the smoke like wandering souls. As soon as the soldiers threw grenades, the vehicles stopped. An officer with a broken ankle bone rolled out of a car, groaning in the bean field. When I walked in front of him, I only heard, "Please, please, give me a shot, I can't live!" I saw very clearly that he was lying on his side in a pool of blood, wearing a brand-new gabardine Air Force uniform, with a Marshall-style hat like the ones seen in pictorials having fallen to the ground, his shiny oriental head stained with mud.

    Suddenly, the sound of artillery explosions shook the fields. Two vehicles were blown up. The wind carried the smoke from the explosions, and the ammunition on the vehicles was ignited. Instantly, thick smoke obscured the sky. Our soldiers said regretfully, "Such rocket shells are wasted; who knows when they will be delivered again."

    Four American-style bombers circled overhead, and tanks followed as they charged, with Chiang's soldiers rushing up in groups. We repelled wave after wave, capturing batch after batch.

    In this tense battle, the anti-aircraft machine gun, just seized from the enemy, had been set up under a tree, and the newly captured gunner was aiming and firing at the enemy planes together with our comrades. Traitor Chiang Kai-shek, you believe in American weapons, but those who wield American weapons do not believe in you!

    As the setting sun reflected, the planes, with a disappointed wail, flew back to their airfield. Under the leaden sky, we began to attack the enemy at Dali Village. The enemy, who had been routed and were in utter disarray, shouted as soon as they made contact with us: "Ah, ah, we are all sitting here waiting for you! Please take the guns away quickly." The gunfire ceased, and it was a silent moonlit night.

　　大李寨阻击战
    罗丰
    九月五日夜，是炮火雷鸣震天动地的一夜。远从鄂北随县、枣阳围剿李先念将军的整三师已占了天爷庙，企图再向我东明侵犯。
    他们是充满着“胜利信心”和“骄傲”的气概，他们曾高喊着“从山岳扫荡到平原”。但经过这一通宵的战斗，动摇了他们胜利的“信心”，而准备逃窜了。
    九月六日早饭后，我军××部，接到了报告“天爷庙的敌人突围逃跑了”。我们即时把队伍带了出去，同志们的战斗情绪和坚强的歼敌决心，马上就变的像一张紧绷绷的弓弦，只等一有机会，就要像猛虎下山一样扑上去。
    时间是飞快的，而我们的指战员的动作，也跟着时间一样飞快，按着布置占领了阵地，有的进攻，有的围击，有的切腰，有的拦头，不大一会在茂密的绿色原野上，响起了一片枪声，交和着一片叫喊口号声：“欢迎三师弟兄放下武器跑过来！”“八路军优待俘虏，不杀俘虏！”
    这时坦克在动着。九连副连长张勤荣同志，带着一个排拦头堵住了亡魂丧胆的坦克。活泼伶俐而且一贯勇敢的战士赵小花，首先爬上了坦克，但爬上去仍无办法打死敌人，坦克仍然在地上动着，小花的手榴弹在乌龟盖上打着喊：“喂，喂，出来缴枪不杀”，但里面没有回声。
    张勤荣同志赶到了，就手急眼快的拿起手榴弹，向坦克透视孔的玻璃上投进去，坦克立时停住了，后面的一辆也就驯服的不动了。六连的战士刘振华、邱正顺在班长张团恩领导下也扑上用手榴弹炸断轮带的办法，两辆坦克也解决了。
    载重汽车赶上来了，手榴弹刚响，敌人就都马上下来了。
    轻快的小吉普车像游魂一样，在硝烟中急驰着，战士们的手榴弹刚抛上去，车便停了，一个炸断了脚踝骨的军官从车上滚下来，呻吟在豆地里。我走到他的面前时，只听到“行行好吧，给我一枪，我不能活了！”，我看的很清楚，他侧卧在殷红的血泊中，是穿着崭新的哔叽空军服，带着像画报上看到的马歇尔带的大帽子已落在地上，发亮的东洋头已染上了泥土。
    突然间炮弹的爆炸声震动了田野，两辆汽车被炸了，野风卷着炸烟，车上的弹药也被燃着，顿时浓烟遮蔽了天日，我们的战士，惋惜的说：“这样的火箭炮弹白费了，那天才能再给送来呢。”
    四架美式的轰炸机，在头上盘旋，坦克也随着冲，蒋兵一群群的跟着冲上来，我们打退了一股又一股，俘虏了一批，又一批。
    在这紧张的战斗中，刚从敌人手中缴过来的高射机枪，已架在树下，刚俘过来的射手却和我们的同志一块在瞄准敌机射击了。卖国贼蒋介石你相信美国武器，但那些手执美国武器的是不相信你的！
    夕阳反照时，飞机才带着失望的哀鸣，飞返他的机场。铅色的天空下，我们开始向大李寨的敌人出击了，被击得溃不成军的敌人，一接触他们就高呼：“唉，唉，我们都坐在这里，等你们哩！你们快把枪拿走吧。”枪声停止了，已是一片沉静的月夜。
