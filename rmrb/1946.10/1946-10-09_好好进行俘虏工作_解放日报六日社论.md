　　Do a Good Job of Prisoner of War Work
    Liberation Daily Editorial on the 6th
    Since the start of the war three months ago, our People's Liberation Army has captured 100,000 Chiang soldiers. This is a very large number. Undoubtedly, in our army's future operations, we will capture even more prisoners. Therefore, working among them will be an extremely important task.
    Many places have already held "Speak Bitterness Against the Civil War" meetings, which is a very good approach. Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers are conscripted; if they weren't, no one would be willing to fight a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, every Chiang soldier has a bellyful of grievances and a painful history. If they don't bring it up, it's fine, but once they do, it brings tears to people's eyes, it fills people's hearts with anger, and it increases the infinite indignation towards Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor! Chiang's soldiers have never had the freedom to pour out the anger in their hearts. After they lay down their weapons and come to the People's Liberation Army, it's like coming home. They have complete freedom to pour out their full grievances to their comrades and their relatives—the People's Liberation Army and the people of the liberated areas. In places where these speak bitterness meetings are held, tens of thousands of prisoners of war open their eyes. They immediately realize a series of issues and automatically request to join our army to fight Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialists. Often, yesterday they were still enemies on the battlefield, wearing "traitor hats" (Chiang's soldiers' term for American-style military caps), forced to fight us. Today they are prisoners, and tomorrow they are already taking up arms to bravely fight Chiang Kai-shek.
    At the same time, this speak bitterness movement also has a great effect on consolidating our own troops and educating the people of the liberated areas. Our liberated area people and liberated area army, having escaped Chiang Kai-shek's dark dictatorial rule, having escaped China's greatest disaster since ancient times, "General Disaster Chiang," live truly free and truly comfortably, almost forgetting that there are still dark things in the world. Then, please listen to the personal accounts of compatriots under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, listen to them personally talk about the life they have experienced! At that time, it will be especially clear to what extent the common people suffer under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, this tyrant. At that time, it will be especially clear that comparing the military and civilian life in the liberated areas with the military and civilian life in Chiang Kai-shek's ruled areas is like comparing heaven and hell. At that time, the enthusiasm for defending the liberated areas will be greatly increased!
    Organizing this speak bitterness movement is a major practical educational work. The army and local authorities should cooperate to carry it out, so that it can have the greatest effect. Another educational task is to make a summary based on this extremely vivid and concrete material, and point out to the Chiang officers and soldiers who have laid down their weapons that the overall reason for their suffering is the aggression of American imperialism and the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek's big landlord, big comprador, and big bureaucratic capital group; point out the future path for them and the Chinese people. This path is to fight to the end for independence, peace, and democracy, to fight to the end against treason, against dictatorship, and against civil war! What force can we rely on to fight? Rely on the people's awareness, rely on the existence and development of the people's liberated areas, rely on the strength of the People's Liberation Army, rely on the liberated areas' resolution of the land problem, rely on the Chiang officers and soldiers' awakening, rely on the peasant armed uprisings and urban democratic movements in Chiang Kai-shek's ruled areas, and rely on the help of the people of the world. Tell them about the important policies of the liberated areas, tell them about the system of the People's Liberation Army, tell them about the great Chinese Communist Party's ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people, and introduce them to Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De, the greatest leaders of the Chinese people in all of history. This educational work should also be done in a lively and vivid way, not just using a dull lecturing style. This kind of work also requires the entire people of the liberated areas and every officer and soldier of the People's Liberation Army to carry out.
    The Chiang officers and soldiers who are captured, except for a few die-hard running dogs of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service chiefs, are all good people. The vast majority of them are workers and peasants, and a large portion are intellectuals. They are outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. They are all at an age of prime, young and promising. American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek force them to fight a civil war, to harm the Chinese nation and harm themselves. We, on the other hand, are exactly the opposite. We are a great university. Our purpose is to save China. We cherish the essence of the Chinese nation and want to educate and organize them in the best way possible to make noble contributions to the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation. Therefore, when they are forced to pick up guns to fight us, we cannot but regard them as enemies and can only fight them resolutely to the end. However, as long as they lay down their weapons, they are our friends, our partners, our compatriots. Not killing captured officers and soldiers who surrender their guns, not searching their pockets, rescuing the wounded, and giving them kind treatment after the fighting stops, caring for their lives like our own brothers, caring for their illnesses. This is the fine tradition of our People's Liberation Army, it is our true color. All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and all the people of the liberated areas must maintain and promote this tradition, and make more achievements in this regard.

### 好好进行俘虏工作  解放日报六日社论

　　好好进行俘虏工作
    解放日报六日社论
    作战三个月以来，我人民解放军已俘虏蒋军十万人，这是一个很大的数目。毫无疑义，在今后我军的作战中，将会得到更多的俘虏。因此，在他们中间的工作，将是一件极其重要的工作。
    许多地方已经进行了“反内战诉苦大会”，这是很好的一种方式。蒋介石的兵是抓来的，不抓就没有谁愿意替蒋介石当兵打内战。因此，每一个蒋军士兵都有一肚子的辛酸泪，都有一篇惨痛的历史。不提起便罢，一提起就叫人落泪，就叫人气炸胸怀，就叫人增加对于蒋介石这个卖国贼的无限愤慨！蒋军士兵一向没有自由倾诉自己心头的愤怒，他们在放下武器到了人民解放军这边来了之后，就像到了家里一样，有充分的自由，向自己的伙伴和自己的亲人——人民解放军和解放区的人民，倾诉自己的满腔冤苦。在举行这种诉苦大会的地方，成千成万的俘虏兵打开了眼睛，他们立即就觉悟到一系列的问题，立即就自动要求加入我军，与蒋介石和美国帝国主义者拚命。往往昨天还是战场的敌人，戴着“汉奸帽子”（蒋军士兵对美国式军帽的称呼），被迫同我们打仗，今天当了俘虏，明天已经拿起武器对蒋介石英勇作战。
    同时，这种诉苦运动，对于巩固我们自己的部队，和教育解放区的人民，也有极大的作用。我们解放区人民，解放区的军队，脱离了蒋介石的黑暗独裁统治，脱离了中国自古以来最大的灾难“蒋总灾”，生活得真正自由真正舒服，几乎忘记人间还有黑暗的事态。那么，请听听在蒋介石统治下的同胞来现身说法，亲身说一说自己所经历的生活罢！那时，就格外明白，在蒋介石这个霸王的统治之下，老百姓是苦到什么程度。那时，就格外明白，把解放区的军民生活与蒋介石统治区域的军民生活一比，一个天堂，一个地狱。那时，保卫解放区的热心，就会何等的增高啊！
    组织这种诉苦运动，是一件重大的实际的教育工作。军队与地方应该来协力进行，使其发挥最大的效果。另外一件教育工作，就是根据这种极其生动具体的材料，作出总结，向放下武器的蒋军官兵指出，他们所受苦难的总的原因，乃是美国帝国主义的侵略，和蒋介石大地主大买办大官僚资本集团的黑暗统治；指出他们和中国人民今后的出路。这个出路，就是为独立和平民主奋斗到底，为反对卖国、反对独裁、反对内战奋斗到底！靠什么力量来奋斗？靠人民的觉悟，靠人民解放区的存在和发展，靠人民解放军的强大，靠解放区的解决土地问题，靠蒋军官兵的觉悟，靠蒋介石统治区的农民武装起义和城市的民主运动，靠全世界人民的帮助。把解放区的重要政策告诉他们，把人民解放军的制度告诉他们，把伟大的中国共产党尽心尽力为人民服务的思想告诉他们，把千古未有的最伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志和朱德同志介绍给他们。这种教育工作，也要用生动活泼的方式，不能光用呆板的说教方式。这样的工作，也需要解放区全体人民和人民解放军每个官兵都来进行。
    俘虏的蒋军官兵，除了几个蒋介石死走狗和蒋介石特务头子之外，都是好人。其中最大多数是工人、农民，一大部分是知识分子，他们是中华民族的优秀儿女，他们都是正在壮年、青年，大有可为的时候。美国帝国主义和蒋介石强迫他们来打内战，来残害中华民族和残害他们自己。我们则与之恰恰相反，我们是一所大学校，我们的目的是要救中国，我们珍惜中华民族的精华，要尽可能最好的教育他们，组织他们，为中华民族的独立和解放作出高尚的事业。因此，当他们被迫拿起枪打我们的时候，我们不能不把他们看作敌人，只能与他们坚决打到底。但是，只要他们放下武器，那就是我们的朋友，我们的伙伴，我们的同胞。对俘虏官兵缴枪不杀，不搜腰包，救护伤兵，战斗停止后给以亲切的待遇，像自己的弟兄一样关心他们的生活，关心他们的病痛。这是我人民解放军的优良传统，是我们的本色。人民解放军全体将士及全解放区人民，都要保持和发扬这个传统，在这方面作出更多的成绩来。
