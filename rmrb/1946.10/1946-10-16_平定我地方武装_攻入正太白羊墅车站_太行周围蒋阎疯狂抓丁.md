[Changzhi, October 12th, Our Newspaper] Our local armed forces along the Zhengtai Railway have launched self-defense counterattacks, achieving successive victories on the 8th and 9th. On the night of the 8th, our Pingding Independent Regiment, in coordination with units of the armed work team, attacked Baiyangshu Station, destroying the locomotive of a military transport train that had just arrived. The two platoons of Yan's troops escorting the train were completely wiped out, except for nine who fled, and a number of firearms were seized. On the night of the 9th, a unit of our military sub-district forces attacked Jiang's army stronghold in Shanxiayin Village (at the junction of Yuanshi and Huolu counties), which was occupied by the 2nd Battalion of the 96th Regiment of the 32nd Division of Jiang's 3rd Army. Two bunkers outside the village were captured by us, and the 4th Company of the battalion guarding the bunkers collapsed and fled in all directions, with the company commander seriously wounded.

[Changzhi, October 12th, Our Newspaper] Chiang and Yan are intensifying conscription around Taihang, resorting to all kinds of tricks. In the Chiang-controlled areas of northern Henan, at the end of last month, they forcibly established "Self-Defense Corps" in each village, using the pretext of training recruits to forcibly transfer them to replenish their losses in the civil war. In Huixian County, the first batch of over 440 recruits have been escorted to Xinxiang, and now each Bao is assigned to conscript three or four more men for the second phase of conscription. The Yan's puppet troops entrenched in Pingding City are racking their brains to come up with all kinds of despicable and shameless methods to seize grain and conscript men. Many people in the suburbs are being threatened and deceived into moving into the city, and more than ten villages south of the city have been turned into a no-man's land. According to escapees, after being forced into the city, all young and middle-aged men between the ages of 18 and 50 are organized into "Revenge Squads," while the remaining old and weak people face extreme hardship and are trying to escape to the liberated areas. Furthermore, at the end of last month, Yan's puppet Zhao Chengshui, Duan Bingchang, and other troops in Yuci launched continuous raids on our border villages such as Donghao, Nan'an, and Shuangcunzhuang to conscript men. The militiamen and young adults in each village were highly vigilant and slept in the fields away from the village at night. Yan and the puppets then arrested more than 100 women, children, and elderly people as hostages to extort recruits and grain.
