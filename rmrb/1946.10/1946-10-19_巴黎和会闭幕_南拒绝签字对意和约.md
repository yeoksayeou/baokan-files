　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Reports from various sources indicate that the post-war Paris Peace Conference, the first of its kind, concluded yesterday at 4:23 PM after lasting two and a half months. French Prime Minister Bidault delivered the closing remarks. The Yugoslav representative did not attend the conference and, in a letter to the conference, reiterated their determination to refuse to sign the treaty with Italy. As representatives from various countries exited the Luxembourg Palace, farewells of "au revoir" filled the air.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Agence France-Presse reports that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his speech at the Paris Peace Conference on the 14th, mentioned the veto power within the United Nations Organization. Molotov stated that Australia, Cuba, and Spaak were attempting to oppose the veto power, but in his view, it was not the veto power that was undermining cooperation within the United Nations. On the contrary, the purpose of the veto power was to seek consensus among the major Allied powers when deciding on important issues. Therefore, the President of the United Nations General Assembly (referring to Spaak) was playing a divisive role, which was quite different from the Soviet representative. Molotov indicated that activities that divide large and small countries will continue to face resolute opposition from the Soviet Union in the future.

　　巴黎和会闭幕
    南拒绝签字对意和约
    【新华社延安十六日电】各方报导：在巴黎举行的战后首次和平会议，在历时两月半之后，已于昨日下午四时二十三分宣告闭幕。法总理比道尔致闭幕词，南斯拉夫代表未出席大会，并在致大会函件中，重申拒绝签署对意和约的决心。当各国代表走出卢森堡宫之际，“纽约见呵”之别词盈耳不绝。
    【新华社延安十六日电】法新闻处报导：苏外长莫洛托夫十四日在巴黎和会的演说中，曾提及联合国组织中的否决权问题，莫氏称：澳洲、古巴以及斯巴克都在企图反对否决权，但是在他看来，破坏联合国合作的，并不是否决权，反之否决权的目的正是在重要问题的决定时求取各大盟国的一致。因此联合国大会主席（指斯巴克）起了分裂者的作用，苏联代表则殊为不同。莫氏表示分裂大小国之活动，今后仍将遭受苏联之坚强果决的反对。
