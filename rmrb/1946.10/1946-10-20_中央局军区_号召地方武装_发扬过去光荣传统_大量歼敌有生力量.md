　　Central Bureau Military Region Calls on Local Armed Forces
    Carry Forward Glorious Traditions and Annihilate Enemy Effectives in Large Numbers
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] The CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and Military Region recently called on all local armed forces to continue to carry forward their glorious traditions, learn from the Shandong local troops, and annihilate the enemy in large numbers. The call stated: The Jiefang Daily's editorial "Three Victories in Half a Month" especially commended the Shandong local corps for their self-defense operations on the east and west lines of the Jiaoji Railway, wiping out nearly one division of Chiang's troops and defeating seventeen regiments that invaded from Zouping Zhangdian in a major victory. The local corps in our region have also achieved many victories: in the Battle of Meng County in Taihang, most of the 17th Division of Chiang's troops was annihilated; in the battles of Hong (dong), Zhao (cheng), Huo (xian), and Ling (shi) in Taiyue, nearly 10,000 invading Yan's troops were wiped out; the Jinnan troops swept away miscellaneous bandits in Gaotang and Renping, and the Yudong troops launched a surprise attack on Zhecheng and recovered Taikang, all achieving significant results. The Central Bureau and Military Region specially call on the local armed forces of all regions to continue to carry forward their glorious traditions, learn from the Shandong local troops, grasp Chairman Mao's operational thinking, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, and create even more brilliant achievements.
