　　"Gold and Silver Cannot Buy My Heart"
    The Story of Huangfu Qijian Rejecting Landlord Tyrants' Thirteen Attempts at Bribery
    Zhou Bo　Xing Yuan
    Huangfu Qijian is an active member in the mass movement in Zhangruji Town, Fourth District of Bo'ai. Due to the development of the emancipation movement and the pressure from the masses, the landlord tyrants shifted from beating activists and threatening them with black guns to bribery. Qijian is a model farmer who rejected thirteen attempts by landlords to buy him off.
    Qijian's family was very poor, and the landlord tyrants saw this. The big tyrant Wang Fuxi was looking for opportunities every day. One day when Qijian was not at home, he had his wife send over thirty-some eggs, saying, "Your family doesn't have chickens, so here are some eggs for you to eat. You're running around outside talking about things..." Qijian's wife carelessly accepted them. In the evening, Qijian came home and, looking at his disappointing wife, wondered why he would give them these eggs? They were not related, and there was no reason for it. So he resolutely returned the eggs. He also discussed this matter with his emancipation friends to make everyone aware of it. Another time, it was raining, and the village head (ruler) Tian Shengshui, trudging through the muddy road, sent over a load of coal: "It's raining, there's nothing to burn, I'll give you some coal to burn, and when my big cart comes, I'll give you some more." The act of false charity seemed quite convincing, but Qijian didn't even let him enter the house, forcefully refusing: "There's coal at the coal factory, the Eighth Route Army doesn't do this, you take it back." Tian always unwilling, smiled and said: "It is raining right now, where are you going to get it? What is wrong with this?" The clear-headed Qijian thought of the past, unable to suppress the hatred in his heart and retorted: "You never gave me anything before, but now you see we poor people, you're giving me coal." And just like that, he sent the landlord away.
    Huangfu Yuzhang was a family member of a puppet soldier and was always afraid of his ugly behavior being exposed. After thinking it over, he realized that Qijian didn't have a quilt. So, on a cold winter day, he secretly took out several lengths of printed cloth from his arms and said to Qijian, "We're together, it feels pretty good, it's cold, I brought you some cloth to make a quilt." He rejected his conspiracy with the words "I have a quilt."
    After this, the landlords' tricks became even more numerous, Qijian's determination became even stronger, and his methods for dealing with the landlords also increased. Yan Hongxun was a lackey who had been struggled against by the masses. He also sent his wife to deliver two斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry measure) of grain, asking him to "grind it into thin rice soup to drink." He also said, "It will be a little better for the New Year." (Because there was more wheat than rice in this area.) When he returned and saw it, he asked his neighbor Man Chao (member of the Peasants' Association) to return it for him. Man Chao even tried to persuade him, saying, "If they gave it to you, just eat it." This made him angry: "What! Don't you know that our Peasants' Association doesn't have such rules? People often say, 'If you eat someone's food, your mouth becomes soft; if you take someone's gift, your hand becomes short.' Do you think it's right to eat it?" Man Chao realized and helped him return it. On the day he turned nearly twenty-eight, the headman Huangfu Qike, again taking advantage of his absence, sent a large bottle of sesame oil, telling his wife: "When the New Year comes, we'll open a small oil mill and send some to your family to eat for the New Year." When he returned, he angrily scolded his wife and had a fight. When returning it, Huang even said: "There is nothing wrong with sending some oil, eat it for the new year, we are all the same people, you are too afraid to take it, what should I give you?" Some gave him money, shamelessly saying: "Just you and me, sleeve to sleeve, no one else will know, no one will snitch. Just take care of things when something comes up and it'll be fine, this is confidential." His rebuttal was also very good: "Even when a crow flies over, there's a shadow. Can you make me embezzle?" In addition, some gave him sweet potatoes to eat. In total, he resolutely rejected thirteen attempts to buy him off with gifts. Each time, he announced it at the Peasants' Association. After everyone discussed it, the members all said, "He won't even take what they give him, we must remember this well. If we encounter it, we'll scold them and bring it up at the general assembly." But there were still some people who didn't understand this principle and continued to give gifts. Later, they came up with a method. At the mass meeting on the fifth day of the first lunar month this year, they announced the refusals by Huangfu Congzhen, Huangfu Qiquan, and three others, as if they were announcing accounts. They questioned their original intentions, explained and educated the masses. From then on, the giving of gifts was stopped at the root.
    After this meeting, the masses in the entire village re-recognized that giving gifts was only fashionable among the Japanese, puppet troops, Kuomintang Central Army, and bandits. It wouldn't work in the people's world led by the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party. Everyone discussed: "The Eighth Route Army doesn't do this." Some said: "The Eighth Route Army is not like the puppet troops and Central Army, who demand even if you don't give. The Eighth Route Army doesn't do this, they won't even take it if you give it, it's really good, really good!" Even the landlord tyrants said: "In the end, this rule is still good. Before, we rich households gave gifts without number. You couldn't do it without giving." Their insidious corrupting tactics also declared bankruptcy.
    Why was he so firm? His own understanding was: "Can you not sell out the law if you are corrupt? Corruption will inevitably lead to selling out the law. Think about it, he looked down on me before. The year my family of three starved to death, he never gave me anything. Furthermore, if you accept someone's bribe, you will inevitably side with them. What emancipation are we leading the people to do? If you are not resolute, accepting from one family will inevitably lead to two or three families. Can there be a wall that doesn't leak after a hundred years? If the masses find out, will they still support us? We discussed this when we formed the Peasants' Association. This is the rule (discipline) we agreed upon. What should the cadres do, what should the members do? We are the Eighth Route Army, not the puppet troops. I am someone who crawled out from under the feet of landlords, how could I fall for his tricks? I have my own ideas."
    Huangfu Qijian often says one sentence: "We can't forget our roots. We are poor people, and the gold and silver of the landlord tyrants cannot buy my heart." He is a person who is rough but has attention to detail, very simple, in his forties, relying entirely on farming and selling jelly to make a living. His life is poor, and he often goes hungry. During the Japanese puppet rule, he had been on the verge of death three times. In the famine of 1932, his wife jumped into a well, and his daughter starved to death. His little piece of land was also taken away by the security force for taxes, leaving him lonely and struggling in the disaster. After liberation, he organized the Peasants' Association and stood up, rising to become a well-to-do middle peasant and got married. While serving as a member of the Peasants' Association in the village, he constantly helped the masses of Wugezhai to emancipate themselves. Thanks to his efforts, poor peasants obtained more than 1,000 mu of land and organized 36 militiamen and 120 members of the Peasants' Association. Because he not only emancipated himself but also helped his poor brothers to emancipate themselves, when the Fourth District established the District Peasants' Association in June, he was elected as a standing committee member. The masses recognized him as their leader. He is truly a model of "wealth cannot corrupt, poverty cannot move, and power cannot subdue" in the mass emancipation movement.

　　“黄金白银买不了我的心”
    皇甫其建拒绝地主恶霸十三次收买的故事
    周波　兴元
    皇甫其建是博爱四区张茹集镇群运中的积极分子，由于翻身运动的开展，群众的压力，地主恶霸由打积极分子、黑枪威胁变为收买，其建就是拒绝过十三次地主收买的一个模范农民。
    其建家很穷，地主恶霸就瞅中了这点。大恶霸王福喜每天在找寻机会，趁其建没在家的一天，让他女人送去三十多个鸡蛋，说：“你家没鸡，给你几个鸡蛋吃，你外头跑来跑去说事……”共建女人很马虎的就留下了。黄昏时，其建回家来，看着自己不争气的女人，心想他为什么要给咱送这呢？一不沾亲，二不带故，随后便毅然地将原物送了回去，他并将这个事实向翻身的朋友们谈了谈，要大家一齐注意这事情。又一次天下着雨，本村首事（统治者）田生水踏着泥泞的道路，送来一担煤：“天下啦，没啥烧，给你些煤烧，等俺大车拉来了再给你些。”一片假慈善很像个样儿，但是其建没等他进屋门，便强硬地拒绝着：“煤厂有煤，八路军不兴这，你快拿回去吧。”田总不甘心，笑着说：“这会天下，你上那弄？这有啥？”头脑清醒的其建一时想到了过去，压不住心头恨的顶过去：“以前就没给我啥，然（现在）看着我们穷人啦，给我送煤啦。”就这样把一个地主打发走了。
    皇甫玉章是个伪军家属，常怕暴露了丑态，想来想去，想到其建没有被子盖。便在严寒冬日，鬼鬼祟祟从怀里拿出几丈印花布，给其建说：“咱在一处，怪不错气，天冷了，我给你拿来点布，做个被子盖。”他又用“有被子”三个字拒绝了他的阴谋。
    这以后，地主花样更多了，其建的决心更坚定，对付地主的办法也多起来。阎红勋是个狗腿，被群众斗争过，也派他女人送来二斗谷子，要他“碾碾滚口米汤喝。”还说什么“过年时稀罕些。”（因此地麦多米少），他回来见了，要求邻居满潮（农会员）替他送回去。满潮还劝他说：“送给你就吃了罢。”这一下他生气了：“啥呀！你不知道咱农会不兴这规矩，人常说，吃了人的嘴软，拿了人的手短，你说吃了对？”满潮醒悟啦，才替他送走。年近二十八的那天，大首事皇甫其可，又趁他不在家，送去一大瓶香油，并给他女人说：“到年下了，咱开小磨油坊，给你家送点过年吃。”他回来，很气愤地，骂了女人一顿，吵了一架。当送回时，皇还说：“送点油没啥，过年吃，都是自己人，这还不敢要，该给你些啥。”有的给他送钱，竟无耻的说：“光咱俩袖口对袖口，别人谁知道，没人啃，不拉倒了，只不过有事照顾照顾就妥啦，这可机密。”他反驳的也很好：“老鸦飞过还有个影儿呢，你能叫我贪污？”此外，还有的给他送红薯吃，前后十三次的收买送礼，他都毅然决然拒绝了，每次都要在农会宣布，大家经过讨论，会员们都说：“给人家还不要，咱可得牢记住，碰上了就骂他一顿，拿到大会上给他提。”可是还有些人，不了解这个道理，还在不断的送礼。后来他们生了个办法，在今年正月初五的群众大会上，像公布账目似的，将给皇甫从真、皇甫其全等三个人所拒绝过的，一一念了一遍，追问了他们的本意，解释教育了群众，从此，送礼才算断了根。
    这个大会以后，全村群众，重新认识了送礼只有是日本、皇协军、国民党中央军土匪们的时髦、行时牌，在八路军共产党领导的人民天下是吃不开的，大家纷纷议论着：“八路军不兴这。”有的说：“八路军不比皇协军、中央军、不给还要，八路军就不兴这，你给都不要，真好，真好！”连地主恶霸也说：“倒底还是这规矩好，以前咱大户送礼就没数。不送也不中。”他们的阴谋腐蚀手段，自己也宣布了破产。
    他为什么这样坚定呢？他自己的了解是：“贪赃能不卖法？贪赃必然要卖法。想一想，以前他就看不起俺，我那年一家三口饿死两口，就没给过我。再说你受了人家贿赂，不向就向了人家，咱还领导老百姓翻啥身？你要不坚决，收下一家就不愁两家三家，一百年能有不透风的墙？群众知道了，还拥护咱不？俺们成立农会时就讨论过，这是俺们议的规矩（纪律），咱干部要开，会员就该怎？是咱八路军，可不是皇协军，我是从地主脚下爬出来的人，还能上了他的当？我有我的老主意。”
    皇甫其建常常说着一句话：“可不能忘了根本，咱是穷人，不管地主恶霸的黄金白银也难买动我的心。”他是个粗中有细的人，很朴素，四十来岁，全靠务农，卖凉粉为生，生活穷困，常闹饥荒。日伪统治时，曾死去活来过三次。三十二年灾荒，老婆跳井，女孩饿死，一点薄田还被保上差款捐走，只留下零丁孤苦的独身，在灾难中喘息，熬煎。解放后，组织农会才翻起身来，上升为富裕中农，结了婚。在村当农会常委时，不断帮助武阁寨群众翻身。在他的努力下，贫苦农民获得土地一千余亩，组织起民兵三十六个，农会员一百二十个。由于他不只自己翻了身，还帮助穷苦弟兄们翻身，六月份四区成立区农会时，他当选为常委，群众公认他是自己的领袖，他真是群众翻身运动中“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的模范。
