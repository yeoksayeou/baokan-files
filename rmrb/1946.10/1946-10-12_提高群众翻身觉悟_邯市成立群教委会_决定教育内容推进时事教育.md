　　Raise the Consciousness of the Masses to Overturn Their Lives
    Handan City Establishes Mass Education Committee
    Decides on Educational Content, and Promotes Current Affairs Education
    [This newspaper, Handan City News] In order to implement the mass movement to overturn their lives, strengthen mass current affairs education and overturning education, and raise the consciousness of the masses, so that the masses can overturn their lives ideologically and culturally, the city has recently established a Mass Education Committee, composed of Mayor Wang, Section Chief Ji, Director Huang of the Bianfu (Border Government), Minister Zhao of the Municipal Political Department, and Director Cheng of the Municipal National Salvation Association, etc. Mayor Wang and Director Cheng were elected as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, and Minister Liu as Secretary. The specific educational content was decided as follows: (1) The focus of current affairs education is to strengthen the understanding of the reactionary American Chiang Kai-shek clique, the understanding of the war, actively prepare for war, support the front lines, and defend the fruits of overturning their lives. (2) Using the method of comparison, reflect on the relationship between society and oneself during the Kuomintang rule, the enemy's rule, and after the liberation by the Eighth Route Army, strengthen unity, raise vigilance against reactionaries, and strictly prevent special agent sabotage activities. (3) Production education, let the masses understand our production policy. Break the erroneous concepts of fearing to rise up and "struggle in reincarnation"; emphasize that thorough overturning of lives requires production, and correct the idea of "eating the rice of struggle". The organizational leadership and working methods adhere to the principles of mass needs and voluntariness, so as not to violate agricultural time and not to delay business time. At present, various districts, villages, and systems have begun to mobilize and organize preparatory work, and the city-wide ideological examination of the masses has begun. (Shu Yu)
