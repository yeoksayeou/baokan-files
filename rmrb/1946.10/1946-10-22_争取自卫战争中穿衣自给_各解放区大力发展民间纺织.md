Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: According to reports from various regions, the civilian textile industry in the liberated areas, striving for self-sufficiency in clothing, has reached a considerable scale. In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, there are 3 million skilled female spinners, producing over 50 million catties of cloth annually. In addition to self-sufficiency, a large quantity of cloth is exported to counties and cities in Hebei, Shandong, and other Kuomintang-controlled areas. Among them, printed cloth from Wuyi and Quzhou in southern Hebei sells well in the Tianjin and Beijing markets. In the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, aside from the newly liberated Rehe and Chahar provinces last year, the cloth production in the Central Hebei and Jin-South regions can be exported in large quantities. In the Xingtai, Pingshan, and other six counties in the Jin-South Third Sub-region, there are currently over 220,000 civilian spinning wheels and over 10,000 looms, exceeding the pre-war level. Jiaodong currently has over 270,000 spinning and weaving machines, with 50% to 70% of women in Wendeng, Rongcheng, and other five counties engaged in textile production. In Central China, according to materials from the Fifth Sub-region of Su-Wan (Yancheng-Funing Area), there are nearly 200,000 civilian spinning wheels and over 8,700 looms. In the Jin-Sui liberated area, which is not a cotton-producing region, textile production has achieved great results in some areas with the promotion and support of the democratic government. In Xing County, 757 out of 768 villages are engaged in household textile production. In the first half of this year, 1.2 million zhang of cloth were woven, enough to clothe half of the county's population.

The development of the civilian textile industry in various regions has had a significant impact on rural life in the liberated areas. In Beitaicun and Yucun in Mancheng, Jin-Cha-Ji, the income from textiles has tripled the village's annual agricultural income. In Dayucun, Tang County, Jin-South region, the development of textiles has enabled farmers to invest more funds in agricultural production. The price of land per mu has risen to 60,000 yuan this spring, while in Zhuanlucun, a neighboring non-cloth-producing area, it is only over 20,000 yuan per mu. New farmers who have become wealthy through textiles are constantly emerging in various regions. Zhang Jinyu, a poor farmer from Lijiazhuang, Gaoyang, Central Hebei, who had fled for three years, returned home last year and started weaving in the winter. Now he has bought 23 mu of land and a house. Zhang Zhenwu, who used to beg for food during the war, cooperated with others to weave cloth for half a year and earned 100,000 yuan, purchasing 10 mu of paddy fields and a mule, and has become a well-fed farmer. The historical tragic fate of women being discriminated against and abused in rural areas and families has been gradually eliminated by the development of textile production. Mei Shu, a young woman from Chengdongshizhuang, Ding County, on the Ping-Han Railway, earned over 20,000 yuan from weaving cloth this spring, buying more than a dozen bags of grain, equivalent to half of her husband's annual agricultural production. The cotton clothes and rations for Jin Guihe's family last winter and the summer clothes this year were mostly due to his daughter-in-law's diligent textile work. Women have already realized that "waiting under the shade of a tree for men to bring food will not improve their status in their entire lives. If they can spin and weave, and work in the fields, men will not dare to look down on them, but will have to respect them."

Experience in various regions has proven that the unified supply and marketing and organizational leadership of rural cooperatives, and the development of self-spinning and weaving by families, are the best ways to promote the development of the civilian textile industry. According to materials from nine counties in southern Shandong, such cooperatives have developed to over 3,100. Female spinners in the Dabozhuangzi Cooperative have become basic members. The Production Promotion Cooperative was established in Linyi City, Shandong, in October last year. There are over 1,800 textile households in the county. In the past year, the masses have earned over 1.2 million yuan in textile profits through the cooperative. The textile production in Beitaicun and Yucun in Mancheng, Jin-Cha-Ji, adopts a family-run model, with the cooperative providing unified supply and marketing and technical guidance. The village's cloth has created its own "plowing cattle" trademark. In mid-July, a cloth merchant from Yi County placed an order for over 3 million yuan from the village. According to materials from one district in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, the entire district has planted 8.5 million mu of cotton, which can produce at least 250 million catties of cotton. This year, 3 million mu of cotton have been planted in Central Hebei, Jin-Cha-Ji. The ten counties in the Jin-South region have also reached 400,000 mu. Assuming a yield of 30 catties of cotton per mu, this is also over 100 million catties. The new cotton from these two regions alone has provided abundant raw materials for the textile industry in the North China liberated areas in the future.

　　争取自卫战争中穿衣自给
    各解放区大力发展民间纺织
    【新华社延安十八日电】综合各地报导，争取穿衣自给的解放区民军纺织业，已具相当规模。在晋冀鲁豫区熟练纺妇达三百万人，年产布五千余万斤，除自给外，尚有大量布匹输出至河北、山东及其他国民党统治区之县市。其中如冀南武邑、曲周一带花布畅销于平津市场。晋察冀边区则除去年新解放之热河及察哈尔外，冀中、冀晋两区布匹，已能大量输出。冀晋三分区行唐、平山等六县，目前民间纺车有二十二万余辆，织机有万余架，已超过抗战前水平。胶东现有纺织机二十七万余架，文登、荣成等五县，有百分之五十至七十的妇女从事纺织生产。华中方面，据苏皖五分区（盐阜区）的材料，民间纺车近二十万辆，织机八仟七百余架。非产棉区的晋绥解放区，经民主政府提倡扶植，纺织在部分地区获得很大成绩，兴县七百六十八个村，进行家庭纺织的即有七五七个村，今年上半年，织布一百二十万丈，可供全县半数人口穿用。
    各地民间纺织业之发展，已使解放区农村生活发生重大影响，晋察冀满城北台、鱼村，一年来纺织收入三倍于该村全年农业收入。冀晋区唐县大雨村，因纺织发展，使农民以更多资金投入农业生产，今春每亩地价已涨至六万元，而邻近非产布区之砖路村，每亩只二万余元。各地不断涌现出借纺织发家致富的新农民，冀中高阳李家庄外出逃亡三年之贫农张金玉，从去年回家，冬天开始织布，现在已买进土地二十三亩，房屋一所。战时乞食度日的张振武与人合作织布半年，获利十万元，购置水田十亩，骡子一头，已成丰衣足食之农民，妇女在农村及家庭中被歧视虐待的历史悲运，已为纺织生产之发展而无形中逐渐消除。平汉路定县城东市庄的青年妇女梅树，今春织布收入二万余元，籴了十几口袋粮食，等于她丈夫全年农业生产收获的一半。农民金贵和去冬全家的棉衣口粮和今夏单衣，大半均得力于他媳妇的辛勤纺织。妇女们已经感到“坐在树荫下等着男人拿吃的来，地位一辈子也别想提高，要是能纺织，能下地，男人们不用说轻视，还得敬着点呢”。
    各地经验证明：农村合作社的统一供销与组织领导，发展以家庭为单位的自纺自织，是促进民间纺织业发展的最好办法。据鲁南九个县材料，这种合作社已发展至三仟一百余处。大膊庄子合作社，民间纺织妇女，已成为基本社员。山东临沂城去年十月成立了生产推进社，该县有纺户一仟八百余户，一年来群众通过合作社所得纺织利润达一百二十余万元。晋察冀满城北台鱼村的纺织，即系采取家庭经营方式，由合作社统一供销与指导技术，该村布匹已独创耕牛商标。七月中，易县某布商，一次即预订该村三百万元之多。另据晋冀鲁豫一个区的材料，全区共植棉八百五十万亩，最少可产棉二万万五仟余万斤。晋察冀之的中，今年植棉三百万亩。冀晋区之十县亦达四十万亩。以每亩收花三十斤计，亦在一万万斤以上，仅此两区新棉，即已给华北解放区今后纺织提供了丰富的原料。
