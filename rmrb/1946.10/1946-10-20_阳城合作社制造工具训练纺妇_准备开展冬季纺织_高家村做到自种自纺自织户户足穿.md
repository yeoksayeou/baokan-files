    Preparing to Launch Winter Textile Production
    Gaojia Village Achieves Self-Sufficiency in Planting, Spinning, and Weaving, Ensuring Adequate Clothing for Every Household
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 18th dispatch] Cooperatives in various villages of the Second District of Yangcheng are currently organizing women on a large scale and preparing spinning and weaving tools in order to launch the winter textile movement. According to statistics from twenty-six cooperatives in two villages, there are 2,875 organized women, with 131 flat looms, 161 shuttle looms, four iron looms, 12 towel looms, 16 warp thread machines, 2,906 spinning wheels, and 16 cotton gins. In order to improve the spinning and weaving skills of women, the Dongye Cooperative has specially invited two spinning technicians from Jiyuan to set up a spinning factory to train women in shifts. Currently, the weaving skills of women in the factory have been greatly improved. Generally, each person can weave four zhang of cloth or 30 towels per day. The cooperative also plans to manufacture 30 shuttle looms for women in the whole village, and six have already been completed.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 16th dispatch] Gaojia Village, Second District of Xingxian, plants cotton in every household and spins and weaves in every family. The village has a total of 115 households and 440 people. Before 1942, relying on agricultural income, each person only earned an average of 7.5 dou of fine grain, and 80% of the families in the village ate black beans and bran. In the winter of 1942, after rent reduction and debt liquidation, the government organized mutual aid teams and promoted large-scale cotton planting and textile production. This year, the cotton fields have increased to 1,100 mu (in 1942, there were only 150 mu), yielding 14,000 jin of cotton, equivalent to 435 shi of fine grain. The income from one *xiang* of cotton is equivalent to the income from five *xiang* of grain. Cotton planting has also promoted women's spinning and weaving, transforming it from centralized cooperative spinning and weaving to household self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-use. Currently, the whole village has 120 spinning wheels, 21 looms, and 1,250 women engaged in spinning and weaving. Every family has someone spinning and weaving, and a total of 700 bolts of cloth have been woven in nine months. In addition to solving the clothing needs of the whole village, 300 bolts have been sold, earning 150 shi of fine grain. The above two items totaled an increase in income of 583 shi of fine grain, averaging 1.3 dou per person, or 300 jin per *shi*, providing sufficient food and clothing for the majority, and 45 households have achieved "cultivating three, surplus one." The Tang Rou family of three has six *xiang* of hillside land, which used to be planted entirely with grains, yielding only 2.5 *shi* of fine grain. This year, they planted three *xiang* of cotton, yielding 170 jin of cotton, equivalent to 7.5 *shi* of fine grain, achieving "cultivating three, surplus one," and having surplus capacity to provide for their children to go to school. Poor peasant Bai Erxin planted four *xiang* of cotton this year, yielding 200 jin of cotton, and three women spun and wove by themselves, producing 16 bolts of cloth. In addition to six bolts for self-use, ten bolts were sold. Including the cotton, the total increase in income was 15.2 *shi* of fine grain, also achieving "spring plowing, three surplus one."

    准备开展冬季纺织
    高家村做到自种自纺自织户户足穿
    【本报阳城十八日电】阳城二区各村合作社，目前正大量组织妇女，准备纺织工具，以开展今冬的纺织运动。据已二个村二十六座合作社统计，有组织的少妇达二千八百七十五人，纺织工具——平机一百卅一张，拉梭机一百六十一张，铁机四张，毛巾机十二张，经线机十六张，纺车二千九百零六辆，轧花车十六架。东冶合作社为提高妇女纺织技术，特从济源请来纺纱技师二人，开办纺织工厂，轮流训练纺妇。现厂内妇女织布技术大见提高。一般每天每人能织布四丈或毛巾三十条。该合作社并计划为全村妇女制造拉梭机三十张，现已制成六张。
    【新华社兴县十六日电】兴县二区高家村，户户植棉，家家纺织。该村共有一百一十五户，四百四十人。民国三十一年前，靠农业收入，平均每人仅得细粮七斗五升，全村百分之八十的人家吃黑豆、糠皮。三十一年冬，经过减租清债后，政府即组织变工互助，提倡大量植棉，开展纺织。今年棉田已增至一千一百亩。（四一年仅有百五十亩）收花一万四千斤，折合细粮四百三十五石。一垧棉花可抵五垧谷物之收入。植棉又推动妇女纺织。从集中合作社纺织转变为家庭自纺、自织、自用。现全村共有纺车一百二十架，织机二十一架，纺织妇女一千二百五十人。每家均有纺织者，九个月内共织布七百匹。除解决全村人穿衣外，并售出三百匹，得细粮一百五十石。上述两项共增加收入五百八十三石细粮，每人平均一石三斗，每石三百斤，大部足衣、足食，且有四十五户做到“耕三余一”。唐肉家三口人，有山坡地六垧，过去全种谷物，仅收细粮二石五斗。今年植棉三垧，收花一百七十斤，折合细粮七石五斗，做到“耕三余一”，有余力供给子弟上学。贫农白二信，今年植棉四垧，收花二百斤，三个妇女自纺自织，产布十六匹，除六匹自用外，出售十匹，连棉花共增加收入细粮十五石二斗，亦可做到“春耕三余一”。
