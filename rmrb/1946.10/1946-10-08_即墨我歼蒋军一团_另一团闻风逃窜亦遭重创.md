Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 4th. In the Jimo county of Jiaodong, one Chiang Kai-shek regiment was completely annihilated, and another suffered heavy losses while fleeing. The First Regiment, comprising over a thousand men, of the Provisional 12th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army under Yan Zifeng (reorganized from Zhao Baoyuan's remnants), which occupied Lingshan, 30 li north of Jimo city, advanced northward on the 3rd. The Eighth Route Army counterattacked, and after a night of fierce fighting, completely annihilated the regiment by 6:00 AM this morning. The spoils of war are currently being inventoried. The Third Regiment of the same division, which fled from Linggezhuang, 10 li south of Lingshan, upon hearing the news, was intercepted by the Eighth Route Army at Heshangzhuang and routed, with over a hundred captured alive, and one mortar, three light machine guns, and over fifty rifles seized. This marks the second severe blow dealt by the Jiaodong Eighth Route Army to the invading Chiang Kai-shek forces within ten days. On September 24th, one regiment of the 198th Division of the 54th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's army, which advanced northwest from Jimo, was annihilated (see this newspaper, October 1st).
