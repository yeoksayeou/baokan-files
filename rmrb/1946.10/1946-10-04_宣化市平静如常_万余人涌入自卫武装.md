Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 30th -- The Chiang Kai-shek army's 16th Army, 94th Division, which is invading the Chahar liberated area along the Ping-Sui Railway, continued its advance towards Kangzhuang from Xibozi (about 65 kilometers northwest of Beiping) today. Another route advanced from Chenjia Yaozi (about 60 li northwest of Beiping) towards Waixiao Nihe. Both routes are engaged in fierce battles.
	Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 1st -- Although Xuanhua City, the capital of Chahar Province, has been repeatedly ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft in recent days, prices are stable, and the citizens are calm as usual. More than 10,000 citizens and workers have poured into the armed inspection teams and self-defense forces. Many street-level cadres in the Second District, such as Zhonggu Street and San Street, have jointly requested the municipal government to go to the front line to resolutely strike at the invaders. A few days ago, the Xuanhua City Garrison held a self-defense mobilization meeting at the People's Theater. Mayor Liu and representatives from all walks of life attended to express their appreciation. The soldiers were filled with confidence in victory, shouting, "We must win more battles and annihilate more reactionary troops! We will live up to the hopes of our fellow citizens!" Dozens of saltpeter-boiling households in the suburbs of Xuanhua City have all joined the shock movement. Saltpeter boiler Wang Xi made two round trips in one day, transporting 1,500 jin of gunpowder, supplying it to the militia's mine workshops. All the fur merchants in the city are working hard day and night to rush to make 2,000 leather overcoats to be transported to the front line, charging 60% lower than the market price.

　　宣化市平静如常
    万余人涌入自卫武装
    【新华社张家口卅日电】沿平绥路向察哈尔解放区进犯之蒋军十六军九十四师，今日一路自西拨子（北平西北方约六十五公里）继续向康庄进犯，一路自陈家窑子（北平西北方约六十里）向外小泥河进犯，两路均在激战中。
    【新华社宣化一日电】察哈尔省会宣化市虽连日迭遭蒋机肆虐，但物价平稳，市民镇静如常，市民工人等涌入武装纠察队及自卫队的已达万余人，二区钟鼓街三街等许多街闾干部皆联名向市政府要求开赴前线，坚决打击进犯者。日前宣市卫戍部队假人民剧院召开自卫动员大会，刘市长偕同各界代表均亲临慰劳，战士们充溢胜利信心，高呼“我们一定要多打胜仗，多多歼灭反动派军队！不负各界同胞对我们的希望！”宣市近郊数十家熬硝户已全部涌入突击运动，硝户王喜一日内单身往返两次，运输火硝一千五百余斤，供给民兵地雷作坊。全市皮毛商行所正连夜精工赶制二千件皮大衣，运往前线，取费低于市价百分之六十。
