Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th. Chiang's soldiers who were liberated in the war of aggression against Jiangsu and Anhui, after receiving preferential treatment and education from the military and civilians in the liberated areas, have volunteered to join the people's ranks, resolutely fighting bravely in the battle of revenge and self-defense against national traitors and dictators. Xiao Deqing, a soldier of the 19th Brigade of Chiang's army who was liberated in the Xuanjiabao campaign, seized four Chiang's army rifles and one Canadian submachine gun in one battle, and persuaded more than ten Chiang's soldiers to lay down their weapons automatically through political appeals. Xiao Deqing has now been promoted to deputy squad leader. Huan Rongfa, a soldier of the Third Company, First Battalion, 78th Regiment of the 26th Brigade of Chiang's army who was liberated in the Linzi battle, rushed to the vicinity of Chiang's army alone in the Yangjiazhuang battle and shouted: "Brothers! The New Fourth Army is a good team to help the poor turn over, I came from Linzi, they treat me very well, come here!" As a result, a squad of Chiang's soldiers all laid down their weapons. Zhou Kai, a soldier of Chiang's New Seventh Brigade who was liberated in Yangzhuang, was captured once in a battle. When Chiang's soldiers loaded their guns to shoot him, he stood up fearlessly and described in detail how he went on strike and how he was treated favorably by the New Fourth Army. This large group of Chiang's soldiers was deeply moved and came back one after another.

　　苏皖解放士兵参加我军英勇作战争取蒋军来归
    【新华社华中二十七日电】在被迫进攻苏皖战争中获得解放的蒋军士兵，受到解放区军民优待教育后，纷纷自请参加人民队伍，坚决在对卖国独裁与复仇自卫战斗中英勇作战。在宣家堡战役解放过来的蒋军十九旅士兵萧德青，一次战斗中缴到蒋军四支步枪，一挺加拿大冲锋式，并以政治喊话争取蒋军十余名自动放下武器。现萧德青已提升为副班长。林梓战斗中解放过来的蒋军二十六旅七十八团一营三连士兵桓荣发，在杨家庄战斗中他单独冲到蒋军近处喊话：“弟兄们！新四军是帮助穷人翻身的好队伍，我是林梓过来的，他们很优待我，你们过来吧！”结果蒋军一班人全部放下武器。在杨庄解放过来的蒋军新七旅士兵周凯，一次参加作战被俘，蒋军枪上了膛要打他，他毫无畏惧地站起来详述他怎样罢战与受新四军优待的情形，这一大群蒋军深受感动，相率来归。
