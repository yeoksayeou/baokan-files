　　Reunion
　　Rotterdam

　　During the day, Suozi's father and Suozi's mother were happily preparing for a good festival – their first reunion festival after liberation. Suozi was not at home, and they hoped that he could return in time.

　　Suozi had fled the famine the year before last. He sent back a letter from Shanxi, saying that things were also difficult there. His wife had been sold, and his child had died... He was working odd jobs for people.

　　Later, there was no news. This year, they heard that the area had become the territory of the Eighth Route Army. Suozi's father thought about going to inquire about him! Just then, another letter arrived, saying that he could return home around the Mid-Autumn Festival. The family was overjoyed.

　　The family was very different from before. They had been newly allocated land, had cotton, and also had grain. Yesterday, Suozi's father listened to Suozi's mother and went to the market to buy pork, bean curd sheets, sesame oil, good vinegar... everything was properly arranged.

　　The moon showed its face for a moment, but was covered by clouds coming from the east. Suozi's father said worriedly:

　　"It looks like it's going to rain today!"

　　"If it rains, Suozi won't be able to come back," Suozi's mother said, also worrying.

　　Everyone else had already eaten dinner. Unable to wait any longer, Suozi's father and Suozi's mother began to eat their meal alone. In the past, it was just the two old people together, and they didn't feel anything. But today, they felt particularly lonely. Suozi's mother moved her chopsticks a few times, sighed, and put them down. Then, Suozi's father also pushed away the bowl of food in front of him.

　　The moon was half-hidden on the rooftop. Suozi's mother tossed and turned in bed. Hearing that Suozi's father was not asleep, she sighed softly and said:

　　"Old man, our Suozi should be back by now!"

　　"Yes!" Suozi's father said, "He should be! We were looking forward to celebrating the reunion festival today, but it's all in vain."

　　As they were talking, Suozi's mother heard a rustling sound in the yard, and it started to rain. Soon, the raindrops were pattering harder and harder on the leaves of the Chinese scholar tree.

　　"Oh dear, haven't we covered the sorghum yet?" Suozi's father hurriedly got up, put on his clothes, and put on his straw hat to go outside.

　　The street was quiet and still. Uncle Xi, the self-defense team member, was hiding under the gatehouse, on sentry duty. Hearing his *puda puda* footsteps, he quickly asked:

　　"Who is it?"

　　As he got closer, he asked him again: "It's raining! Where are you going in such a hurry?"

　　"Going to the threshing ground to cover the sorghum." Suozi's father was anxious and didn't bother to explain in detail. He opened the fence gate and ran towards the threshing ground.

　　Just as he reached the edge of the threshing ground, he heard a rustling sound from inside. Almost at the same time, he asked, at a loss, together with another voice:

　　"Who? Who?"

　　Suozi's father was so scared that he trembled all over, not knowing what to do.

　　Uncle Xi also heard the sound outside from inside the fence gate. He ran out with a hand grenade. Seeing someone coming, Suozi's father became bolder and quickly said:

　　"There's someone in the sorghum stack."

　　"It's me." Sure enough, a person came out from behind the sorghum stack, wearing a military uniform. The military cap had been soaked by the rain and was hanging down, covering his forehead. His entire face was blurry.

　　"Who are you?" Uncle Xi raised his hand grenade and aimed it at him.

　　"Dad, Uncle Xi," the man said suddenly, affectionately, "Don't you recognize Suozi anymore!"

　　"Ah! Suozi?" Suozi's father took a step closer, and carefully judged the voice. He then reached out and grabbed his shoulders tightly, saying: "You... you really came back!"

　　Uncle Xi didn't know what to say on the side. After a while, he suddenly seemed to remember something, and asked coldly:

　　"Suozi, where are you coming from? Do you have a pass?"

　　"Yes, yes, Uncle Xi, I just came back from the army, I have a certificate!"

　　Then, he said: "I walked as fast as I could all the way, wanting to get home on the Mid-Autumn Festival. I got up early this morning and didn't dare to rest on the road, still arriving in the dark. Just as I got to the entrance of the village, the heavy rain came. I was anxious to enter the village, and I saw someone's sorghum in the threshing ground being drenched in the rain without being covered. There were some stalks nearby. I thought it was too late, and it was going to get wet anyway, so I covered it for them! The instructor in the army often told us to help the people at any time! I had only covered half of it when you came out."

　　Suozi's father quickly interrupted and said:

　　"This is our family's sorghum! Suozi, you don't know yet, the poor people in our village have all been liberated, we have land, and we also have grain."

　　Uncle Xi said: "That's great! Cover it quickly! Don't let it get drenched in the rain! You should all go home and have another reunion dinner."

　　After entering the village, Suozi also told his father that he wanted to go back to join the Eighth Route Army after the festival. This time he was captured by the Eighth Route Army, and not only did he not suffer, but he was also allowed to live and train. They allowed him to return home after not being able to for years. Before he left, the instructor repeatedly told him to remember the army, and it would be alright to go home and visit and then go back. After seeing the situation at home, he made up his mind.

　　Suozi's father nodded as he busily told him the story of how the village had been liberated. With about ten steps to go to the house, Suozi's father shouted loudly:

　　"Mother, get up quickly and light the fire, Suozi... Suozi is back!"

　　团圆
    鹿特丹
    白天，锁子爹和锁子娘欢天喜地准备着过一个好节日——翻身后第一个团圆节。锁子不在家，他们盼望着他能及时赶回来。
    锁子是大前年个逃灾荒跑出去的，在山西寄回来过一封书子，说在那里也是没办法，媳妇子卖了，孩子死了。……自己给人家打短工。
    后来一直就没有消息，今年听说那地方成了八路军的了，锁子爹想着人去打听一下呢！恰好又来了封书子，说八月十五前后可以回家，家里可真是喜出望外。
    家里已经跟往年大不相同了，新分了地，有了花，也有了粮食。昨天，锁子爹听了锁子娘的话，去集上买了猪肉、粉皮、香油、好醋……安顿得停停当当。
    月亮露了一下头，就被从东边赶来的云彩遮住了，锁子爹耽心地说：
    “今儿个怕要下雨呢！”
    “一下雨，锁子就回不来了。”锁子娘说，也发着愁。
    别的人家都吃过晚饭了，再不能等了，锁子爹和锁子娘才拾夺了碗筷孤独地吃起来。往天，也是他们两个老人在一起，并不觉得怎样，今天却特别感到冷落。锁子娘动了几下筷子，叹口气就放下了；接着，锁子爹也推开了面前的菜碗。
    月亮半隐半现地渡到了屋脊上，锁子娘在床上翻了几下，听见锁子爹还没有睡着，就轻轻叹口气道：
    “他爹，俺锁子该回来啦！”
    “嗳！”锁子爹说：“该不是么！尽等着今天过节团圆呢，又等了个空。”
    正说着话，锁子娘听见院里悉沙悉沙地已经下开雨了，一会，椿树叶上嘀搭嘀搭地雨势越来越大。
    “嗳，高粱还没有扇（即遮）起来呢？”锁子爹忙起来披了衣服戴上草帽往外走。
    街里，悄悄地没有一点动静，自卫队的西大叔躲在门楼下放哨，听着他噗哒噗哒的脚步声，忙问：
    “谁？”
    临近了，又问他：“正下雨哩！忙着去那里？”
    “去场里扇高粱。”锁子爹心急意乱地不顾得细说，开了栅门就朝场里跑。
    刚到场边，只听得场里嗦嗦的地一阵乱响，几乎是同时候，他不知所措地和另外一个声音一齐问了：
    “谁？谁？”
    锁子爹吓得浑身打颤，不知所措。
    西大叔在栅门里也听见外边的声音，拿着手榴弹就跑出来。锁子爹见有了人来，胆子才一壮，忙说：
    “高粱垛里有人。”
    “是我。”果然，从高粱垛后出来一个人，一身军服，军帽已被雨水淋得搭拉下来，遮住了前额，整个面孔模糊不清。
    “你是谁？”西大叔高举着手榴弹对准他问。
    “爹，西大叔，”那人忽然亲热地说：“锁子你们也不认识了呀！”
    “啊！锁子？”锁子爹逼近了一步，又仔细地判断了一下声音，才伸过手去紧紧抓住他的肩膀说：“你……你当真回来啦！”
    西大叔在旁边不知道该说些什么，呆了一会，突然像想起了什么，很冷淡地问：
    “锁子，你从那来，可有路条么？”
    “有，有，西大叔，俺刚从队伍上回来，有证明信哩！”
    接着，他又说：“俺一路上紧走慢走，总想在八月十五回到家，今天一打早就起身，路上没敢歇，还是摸黑天。刚到村头，大雨就来了，急着想进村呢，看见场里不知是谁家的高粱在雨地里淋着没有扇，旁边正有些秆秸子，俺一想天也太晚了，左右是个湿，给人家扇上吧！队伍上的指导员常跟俺们讲，要随时随地帮助老百姓呢！才扇了一半，你们就出来了。”
    锁子爹忙抢着说道：
    “这就是咱家的高粱呀！锁子，你还不知道，咱村里穷人都翻身了，有了地，也有了粮食了。”
    西大叔说：“得着哪！快扇吧！别尽在雨地里淋着啦！你们也该回家去再吃一顿团圆饭。”
    进了村，锁子又告诉他爹说，他想过了节还回去参加八路去，这次他被八路军俘虏了，不但没受苦，还让住训练，准他回了几年不得回的家。临走的时候，指导员再三给他说，要想念队伍，回家看看再去也中，他见了家里这情形，决心就下了。
    锁子爹一边点着头，一边就又忙着告诉他村里是如何如何翻了身的故事。再有十来步到家了，锁子爹大声唔叫道：
    “他娘，快起来煽开火，锁子……锁子回来了！”
