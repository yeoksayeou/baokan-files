　　Taiyue Militia Cooperates with Main Force
    Fully Recover Fuyi Highway
    Briefly Attacked Fushan City, Capturing Over Forty Chiang Soldiers
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th Dispatch] The Fushan-Yicheng Highway, stretching seventy li from north to south, has been completely recovered by our Eighth Route Army. On the 4th and 5th, the Eighth Route Army, with the cooperation of local militia, counterattacked the Chiang troops who had seized our Fuyi Highway, successively recovering the stubborn puppet strongholds of Dongzhang, Xiangshui River, Zhayingpo, and Nanpan Bridge. Thus, over seventy li of highway from the south of Fushan city to the north of Zhengzhuang in Yicheng is completely under our army's control. The local militia and local armed forces, during the ten days of the Chiang troops' occupation of the Fuyi Highway, killed or wounded over 120 Chiang soldiers and cut over 20 li of electric wires. On the evening of the 7th, our army attacked Fushan County, capturing the East Gate and West Gate, capturing over forty Chiang soldiers alive, and seizing two light machine guns, one small cannon, and over twenty rifles.
    [Another Dispatch] During the twelve days that the Chiang troops' 27th Brigade occupied our Fushan city, the guerrillas and militia active in the suburbs constantly attacked, day and night. In the past week, the Chiang troops launched four offensives against the guerrillas, all of which were repelled. When our army and people withdrew from Fushan city on the 24th of last month, they laid landmines throughout the streets and alleys; on October 2nd, there were three consecutive explosions in one day, killing fourteen Chiang soldiers and platoon leaders who triggered the mines. All the Chiang officers and soldiers in the city lived in three private residences and dared not move around at will. The Chiang soldiers called themselves entering the "City of Premature Death."
