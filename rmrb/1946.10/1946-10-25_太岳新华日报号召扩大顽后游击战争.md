*Taiyue Xinhua Daily* Calls for Expanding Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines

[This dispatch from Yangcheng, 21st] The *Taiyue Xinhua Daily* published an editorial calling for a greater expansion of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and in bordering areas. The editorial stated: "Young militiamen are truly capable," "Central Army" troops spin around when they arrive, firing shots to the east and bullets to the west, planting landmines and throwing grenades; some coordinate with the regular army to attack fortifications, while others engage in sparrow warfare, transforming the enemy's rear into the front lines." This is a popular folk song on the Tongpu front, painting a picture of the raging guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines on our front, and pointing out the direction of struggle for our patriotic self-defense guerrilla warfare. Since the beginning of the month, with the deepening of the Jiang-puppet forces and the great victory on the Linfen-Fushan front, the flames of our guerrilla warfare have spread throughout the entire front line and behind enemy lines. Now, from Pingyao and Jiexiu in the north to the Yellow River in the south, from Fenxi in the west to Jiyuan and Mengxian in the east, there are active guerrilla units and militias everywhere. Everywhere is the Jiang army's "front line," and everywhere are three or five, a squad, a platoon, or a company of Jiang troops being annihilated or forced to lay down their weapons. If these victorious battle achievements could be tallied, they would amount to an extraordinarily astonishing number. This type of guerrilla warfare, accumulating small victories into a large one, is an indispensable condition for winning the final victory in the patriotic self-defense war. Coordinating with our frontal counterattacks, it has already caused the Jiang army to be attacked from all sides, front and rear, and fall into a dilemma of advancing and retreating. This is specifically manifested in the fact that the Jiang army's rear, through the continuous harassment, attacks, and attrition by our local military groups, guerrilla units, and militias, has forced the Jiang army to withdraw from vast occupied areas and be trapped in narrow points and lines. For example, in the Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Pinglu areas, our local military groups and militias have successively recovered dozens of strongholds such as Yanzhang, Hedi, Caicun, Huzhang, Shangxia Fengcun, and Cuijiahe, pressing towards the suburbs of Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Pinglu. Our local military groups, combined with the militia, also crushed the Jiang army's offensive five times in five days from October 2nd to 7th, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly a hundred invading troops. In the Fushan-Yicheng area, after the Jiang army invaded and occupied Fushan for ten days, its rear road, the Fushan-Yicheng highway, was recovered by us. Within these so-called grid networks, many outstanding combat heroes and militia heroes have emerged. Ren Keliang of Xiaxian is a banner among the militia heroes. Under their leadership, and with the arduous struggle of the broad masses, the "small grids" have been transformed into "large grids," to the extent that the generals' communication and transportation lines are fragmented and incomplete. In the long bordering areas, guerrilla units and militias have formed joint village defenses,展开了犬牙交错的斗争, engaging in interlocking struggles. The "Du Eight Joint Defense" in Jiyuan and the "Iron Joint Stone Defense" in Hongtong are glorious examples of this. In front of these joint defense fortresses, some areas have made the Jiang army afraid to lightly cross the Lei Pool by even one step. Even if it advances one step or "nibbles" at a place, it must pay a bloody price. For example, the Jiang army that窜陷 invaded Fushan this time abandoned a large number of corpses on Xice Ridge between the Linfen and Fushan highways. And fortresses like "Du Eight Joint Defense" have stood firm against four recent attacks by the Jiang army. In every major battle, our local military groups, guerrilla units, and militia heroes bravely stepped onto the front lines, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the regular army, seizing the enemy's weapons to arm themselves. In the battles of Chenyan and Guanque this time, the militias of Linfen, Hongtong, and Fushan braved the artillery fire to guide the regular army, indicate targets, and capture fleeing Jiang troops, seizing large quantities of American weapons. Many militiamen's equipment has also become Americanized, writing a glorious page in the history of our militia building. This kind of rear-area guerrilla warfare, combined with frontal resistance, is the three aspects of activity for our local military groups, guerrilla units, and militias. It is the "battleground" for our self-defense heroes, and the different tasks we have at different times in different regions. The facts of the past three months, especially the past half-month, show that we have bravely taken on such glorious tasks and made astonishing contributions. Now that the war situation has entered a stage of all-out resistance, and the war is long-term and brutal, we extend our highest respect and condolences to the local military groups, guerrilla units, and militia heroes, and put forward the following hopes: The wider the Jiang army's battle line stretches, the more its forces are dispersed. The local armed guerrilla units and militia heroes behind enemy lines should learn from Ren Keliang of Xiaxian, constantly harassing and attacking the invading army, gradually compressing it into isolated points and lines, cutting off its transportation lines, and attacking its supply columns, and surrounding it, so as to protect the interests of the masses, protect the fruits of the masses' liberation, and wait for an opportunity to recover lost territory. In the bordering areas, we should learn from the "Du Eight Joint Defense" and other examples, strengthen joint village defenses, one village alerts, all villages respond, widely plant landmines, implement a combination of landmines and rifles, block the invading forces' inevitable routes, so that every action they take must pay the price of life, and make the long bordering areas become dragon pools and tiger dens, "iron fortresses," to protect our homes and protect the people's lives and property. When the regular army is fighting, we should actively participate and coordinate, act as guides for the regular army, attack the flanks, capture prisoners... to eliminate more of the invading army's living strength. We have such an increasingly strong and坚强的 local armed forces and guerrilla units, we have such tens of millions of militia heroes who do not eat public grain, do not take supplies, and can act without waiting for orders, and we are closely cooperating with the regular army. This is our reliable guarantee to support a long-term war, constantly wear down the invading army, and finally recover lost territory. The hopes of the people of the whole country are focused on us. We should, with an incomparably heroic spirit, further expand the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and in bordering areas, defeat the Jiang army's invasion, strive for more victories, to satisfy the wishes of the people and strive for the realization of peace.

### 太岳新华日报号召扩大顽后游击战争

　　太岳新华日报号召扩大顽后游击战争
    【本报阳城廿一日电】太岳新华日报发表社论，号召更加扩大顽后及边缘地带的游击战争。该社论略谓：“青年民兵真能干”，“中央军”来了打转转，东一枪西一弹，埋地雷扔炸弹，有的配合正规军打碉堡，有的展开麻雀战，变顽后方为前线。”这是流行在同蒲前线的民谣，它给我们前线顽后如火燎原的游击战争绘出了一幅图景，它给我们爱国自卫的游击战争指出了斗争的方向。自月初以来，随着蒋伪的深入与临浮前线的大胜，我游击战争的烽火燃遍了整个的前线与顽后，现北起平、介，南迄黄河，西至汾西，东达济、孟，到处都有活跃的游击队与民兵，到处都是蒋军的“前线”，到处都有三五个、一班、一排、一连的蒋军或被歼灭或被迫放下武器。这些胜利的战绩要能统计起来，将是一个异常惊人的数字，这种积小胜为大胜的游击战，是争取爱国自卫战争的最后胜利必不可少的条件，它与我正面的反击相配合，已使蒋军前后左右受敌而陷入进退维谷的境地。这具体表现在蒋军的后方经我地方兵团游击队与民兵的不断的困袭击消耗，迫使蒋军不得不退出广大侵占地区而困守狭窄的点线，如在闻、夏、平地区，我地方兵团与民兵已先后收复堰掌、河底、蔡村、胡张、上下冯村、崔家河等数十据点，进迫闻喜、夏县、平陆城郊。我地方兵团结合民兵，并于十月二日至七日五天内五次打垮蒋军进攻，毙伤俘进犯军近百。在俘、翼地区于蒋军侵陷浮山十日后，其后路浮山翼城公路即经我收复。在这些所谓格子网内出现了许多出色的战斗英雄、民兵英雄，夏县的任克良便是民兵英雄里面的一面旗帜。在他们领导之下，在广大群众艰苦奋斗之下，已变“小格子”为“大格子”，以至使将军的连络运输线支离破碎残缺不全。在漫长的边沿地带，游击队与民兵结成了联村联防展开了犬牙交错的斗争，济源的“杜八联”与洪洞的“铁联石防”，便是这里面光荣的典范。在这些联防的堡垒面前，有些地区使蒋军不敢轻越雷池一步，即使它前进一步或“蚕食”一地，都要付出血的代价，如这次窜陷浮山的蒋军，便在临浮公路之间的西侧岭上遗弃了大批尸体。而象“杜八联”这样的堡垒，近被蒋军四次进攻屹立不动。在每一个较大的战役中，我地方兵团游击队与民兵英雄们更勇敢的走上前线，与正规军并肩作战，夺取顽军的武器来武装自己。这次陈堰、官雀的战斗中，我临汾、洪洞、浮山的民兵，便冒着炮火给正规军引路指示目标，并捕捉逃散的蒋军，大量缴获美国武器，许多民兵的装备也美国化了，为我民兵建设史中写下了光辉的一页。这样顽后游击正面阻击配合作战，便是我地方兵团游击队及民兵活动的三个方面，便是我们自卫英雄们的“用武之地”，便是我们在不同地区不同时间的不同任务。三个月尤其是半月来的事实，说明我们已英勇的负起了这样的光荣任务，并作出了惊人的贡献。今后战局已进入全面抵抗，战争是长期与残酷的，我们除向各地方兵团游击队及民兵英雄们致以崇高的敬意和慰问外，并提出如下的希望：蒋军的战线拉得愈广，它的兵力也更加分散，顽后的地方武装游击队与民兵英雄们应向夏县任克良学习，不断的袭扰打击进犯军，逐渐将它压缩到孤立的点线内，并切断它的运输线，打击它的补给队，而将它围困起来，这样来保卫群众的利益，保卫群众的翻身果实，以等待时机收复失地。在边缘区应学习“杜八联”等范例，加强联村联防，一村报警，村村响应，广布地雷，实行雷枪结合，封锁进犯者必经之路，使他每一行动都要付出生命的代价，使漫长的边缘地带都变成龙潭虎穴“铁石堡垒”，来保卫我们的家乡，保卫人民的生命财产。在正规军作战时，应主动参加配合，为正规军作向导，打侧翼，捉俘虏……以更多的消灭进犯军的有生力量。我们有这样日益壮大坚强的地方武装及游击队，我们有这样千千万万一不吃公粮，二不拿给养，三不待下命令便可行动起来的民兵英雄与正规军紧紧配合起来，便是我们支持长期战争不断消耗进犯军以至最后收复失地的可靠保证。全国人民的希望都集中在我们的身上，我们应以英勇无比的精神，更加扩大顽后及边缘地带的游击战争，打败蒋军进犯，争取更多胜利，以慰国人的愿望，争取和平的实现。
