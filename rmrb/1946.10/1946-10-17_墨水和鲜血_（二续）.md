　　Ink and Blood
   (Continued II)
    By Ilya Ehrenburg, Translated by Wan Ge
    Americans have two sets of standards: one for judging moral America and Britain, and another for dealing with the "evil" Soviet Union. If Americans want to use Iceland as a base, it is "to ensure world security." If the Soviet Union does not want its neighbors to be used as bases for aggression against the Soviet Union, it becomes "Red imperialism." If the United States manufactures atomic bombs, it is the mysterious work of scientists, or just harmless entertainment like football. If Red Army personnel line up to go to a steam bath in the streets of Moscow, it is "preparing for World War III."

    Many American newspapers use the Soviet Union to frighten their readers like using monsters in absurd stories to scare children, and many readers who have long passed childhood still start to shiver.

    Americans have many good morals, but not all Americans have good memories. Their minds are filled with daily events, and they rarely think about history. A woman told me: "You won't be interested in reading this novel, it's not new, it was published two years ago." Here, fashions change quickly, which is good, but concepts also change quickly, which is not good. Can readers still remember what they read a year ago? Professor Einstein once told me about an African tribe where people use the names of objects or phenomena as their surnames, such as "Hawk," "Palm," "Dawn," and "River." When a person dies, their surname becomes "taboo," so he must rename those "Hawks," "Palms," "Dawns," and "Rivers." Is it good if not only names but also concepts change so quickly? Is it long ago that the general American public praised the epic of Stalingrad? Is it long ago that they held their breath and paid attention to every step of the Red Army's progress? But now, after reading their morning and evening newspapers, many Americans think that the Red Army is threatening their happiness and may have to drop an atomic bomb on Stalingrad on a bright sunny day. When an American embraces his son who has just returned from Europe, does he think that the reason his son is still alive may be because a Russian youth fell on the banks of the Volga River?

    I was talking to a farmer in Tennessee who told me that Americans are bound to fight a war with the Russians. He is a peace-loving man whose entire interest is in his cattle. Thanks to the TVA, he is milking with electricity, which gives him plenty of time to study his local newspapers. These newspapers are telling him about Russia's new conspiracies—in Trieste, in Korea, in Tabriz. This farmer knows much more about how to milk cows than about world geography; he reads these newspapers and is terrified by the terrible crimes of the Soviet Union.

    Perhaps he has read the accusation of a certain faction in the May 18th issue of *Chickesfal* magazine: it says that Moscow is Mishech mentioned in the fifth verse of Psalm 120 of the Old Testament, and Magog mentioned in the Old Testament's *Book of Ezekiel* is Russia, and destroying this communist Magog nation is an urgent matter (according to the Old Testament, Mishech and Magog are the ancestors of two extremely barbaric peoples – translator's note). All this sounds like a ridiculous story, but it is printed in black and white. An American journalist asked me: "Don't pay attention to those things in our newspapers, they are all written by madmen."... We also have madmen in Russia, but they don't publish newspapers.

　　墨水和鲜血
   （二续）
    爱伦堡作  万歌译
    美国人有两付尺度：一付用来衡量有道德的美国和英国，另一付则用来对付“罪恶”的苏联。如果美国人想把冰岛作基地，那便是“为了世界安全的保障”。如果苏联不欲她的邻邦被利用作为侵略苏联的基地，那便成了“赤色帝国主义”。如果美国制造原子弹，那是科学家们的奥妙工作，或只是足球似的无害娱乐。如果红军人员排成行列走到莫斯科的街道上去洗蒸气浴时，那便是“准备作第三次世界大战了”。
    许多美国报纸用苏联恐吓他们的读者像用荒诞故事中的鬼怪吓小孩一样，而许多早已过了儿童时期的读者，仍会发起抖来。
    美国人有许多优良道德，但并不是所有的美国人都有着良好的记忆力。他们的心都给日常的事件所占满，他们很少想到历史。一位妇女告诉我：“你不会有兴趣读这本小说的，它已不新鲜了，它是二年前出版的”。在这里，时式迅速的在变，这很好，但这里概念也在迅速的变，那便不好了。读者们还能记得他们一年前所读的东西吗？爱因斯坦教授曾在告诉过我一个菲洲的部落，那边的人都是拿物或现象的名字来作姓名的，“鹰隼”、“棕榈”、“黎明”、“河流”等都可以。当人死后他们的姓便成了“忌讳”，因此，他必须给那些“鹰隼”、“棕榈”、“黎明”、“河流”等重新取名了。假使不止姓名，连人的概念也这样快的更换，是不是好呢？一般美国人的赞美斯大林格勒史诗是离此很久以前的事了吗？他们屏着呼吸注意红军每一步进展是离此很久以前的事了吗？可是在现在许多美国人在读了他们的晨报和晚报后，便以为红军在威胁他们幸福，并且可能必须在某一明亮的晴天投一个原子弹到斯大林格勒了。一个美国人拥抱着他刚从欧洲回来的儿子，他有没有想到他的儿子所以仍能活着回来可能便是因为一个俄国青年已在伏尔加河岸旁跌倒了的缘故？
    我曾在田纳西州和一个农民谈话，这农民告诉我美国人难免和俄国人一战。他是一个爱好和平的人，全部兴趣都放在他的牛只上，感谢ＴＶＡ，他正靠着电力榨乳，这就使他有充分的时间来研读他本地的报纸。这些报纸都在告诉他俄国的新阴谋，——在的里雅斯特、在朝鲜、在大不里士，这农民对如何榨牛乳的知识比对世界地理的多许多；他读了这些报纸，便给这可怖的苏联的罪恶吓慌了。
    可能已读到五月十八日那期鸡克斯伐尔杂志中某派的控诉：那里边说莫斯科便是圣经旧约诗篇第一百二十篇第五节中所提到的米设，而旧约《以西结书》中所提到的玛各便是俄罗斯，毁灭这共产主义的玛各国，实在是一件刻不容缓的事（按照旧约米设和玛各是二支极野蛮的一种人的祖先——译者注）。所有这些听来好像荒唐的故事，但却是用白纸黑字印出来的。一个美国新闻记者问我说：“不要去理那些在我们报纸中的东西，那些全是疯子写的。”……我们在俄国也有疯子，可是他们并未出版报纸。（未完）
