The Kuomintang government, with its active assistance, launched an unprecedented civil war in late June, attempting to destroy the main force of the People's Liberation Army within half a year and eliminate all liberated areas and democratic forces within a year. Three months have passed, what has Chiang Kai-shek gained? After Chiang's army occupied Guangshan County on January 14, they surrounded the main force of our Central Plains Military Region with 300,000 troops, compressing our army into an area of 120 miles around Xuanhua Store. In mid-June, Chiang Kai-shek personally issued an order, limiting the attack to June 25 and vowing to annihilate our army by June 30. Our Central Plains Army rose up and broke through the encirclement, crushing the Pinghan Railway blockade on the evening of the 29th and advancing westward on a large scale. The actions of our Central Plains Army caused Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to suffer a disastrous defeat. Chiang Kai-shek was furious, and Song Ruike, commander of the 66th Army, and Wu Tinglin, commander of the 15th Army, were both reprimanded by Chiang Kai-shek. After that, Chiang's army pursued our Central Plains Army continuously for a month and a half, but was ultimately unable to catch up and suffered heavy casualties. Currently, the main force of our Central Plains Army has created new liberated areas on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, while our troops led by Wang Zhen, Pi Dingjun, and Zhang Tixue have entered Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Central China, Dabie Mountains, and other places respectively. Our guerrillas scattered east and west of the Pinghan Railway are tying down five divisions of Chiang's army. This breakout has successfully achieved its strategic transfer objective, liberating us from the state of being surrounded in the Xuanhua Store area. Chiang's army not only gained nothing but suffered huge losses. For example, Zhao Xitian's 10th Army, which originally had more than 15,000 men, lost 6,000 to 7,000 men in pursuit due to deaths and desertions. The 41st, 47th, 15th, 72nd, and 75th armies all suffered significant reductions in strength. As a result, many officers below the regimental and battalion levels, including Fu Yi, commander of the 72nd Army, and Liu Jimin, commander of the 75th Army, were dismissed and punished by Chiang Kai-shek. In total, during the Central Plains Campaign, as many as four Chiang's army commanders at the army level were punished.

Chiang Kai-shek, under the pretext that our army in northern Jiangsu "threatened the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai," used 20 divisions and most of the navy and air force to launch a joint offensive against northern Jiangsu on July 15, attempting to bloodbath our Jiangsu-Anhui border region. The murderer Chen Cheng even clamored for a "military final." Our army in central Jiangsu rose up in self-defense. Under the command of Generals Su Yu and Tan Zhenlin, they won seven battles in seven engagements in a month and a half, completely annihilating seven divisions (brigades) and two traffic police corps of Chiang's army, totaling more than 60,000 men. The remnants were trapped in a few strongholds such as Rugao, Hai'an, and Huangqiao. Li Mo'an, who commanded Chiang's army in central Jiangsu, was dismissed by Chiang and replaced by Tang Enbo, who was notorious for his defeats during the War of Resistance. The 92nd Division of Chiang's army in Huaibei was completely wiped out, and Liang Hanmin, commander of the 92nd Army, was "dismissed" as a result. Due to the disastrous defeat in central Jiangsu, Chiang changed his plan and attempted to invade Huaiyin and Huai'an from Xuzhou and Suxian. After our army inflicted heavy casualties on Chiang's army, we withdrew from Huaiyin and Huai'an on September 19 and 21. From then on, Chiang's military strength became more dispersed and the rear lines of communication became longer. What General Su Yu said, "Huaiyin and Huai'an will be the graveyard of Chiang's army," will definitely come true.

In order to smash Chiang's offensive against our eastern Henan liberated area and coordinate the self-defense of our armies in northern Jiangsu and the Central Plains, our troops and civilians in Hebei-Shandong-Henan launched an attack on the Longhai Railway on August 10. Within four days, they captured five cities including Lanfeng and Dangshan, controlled more than 350 miles of the Longhai Railway, annihilated Chiang's 181st Division (only the division commander Mi Wenhe escaped in disguise), and inflicted heavy casualties on the 18th Army, the 29th Division, and the 74th Division. In early September, they also annihilated Chiang's direct line 10th Army (i.e., the 3rd Division), captured the army commander Zhao Xitian alive, and dealt heavy blows to the 41st and 47th Armies (Divisions). Liu Zhi, director of the Kuomintang Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, was therefore dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek on September 15 and replaced by Gu Zhutong, the culprit of the Southern Anhui Incident. After Gu took office, he again drove the defeated army and the 5th Army of Qiu Qingquan and the 11th Division of Hu Lian, who came from Xuzhou and Dangshan, to invade our Dingtao and Heze (Caozhou) areas. We lured the enemy deep and voluntarily withdrew from Heze. Our elite troops south of the Longhai Railway then recovered Taikang and Huaiyang and liberated a large area, effectively coordinating the operations north of the railway. Our army in northern Henan also launched self-defense in early August, sweeping away more than 50 strongholds of Chiang's army in the entire territory of Meng County in three days and nights of fierce fighting, and annihilating part of Chiang's 17th Division. On the 21st, our army in northern Henan once attacked Huixian, where a battalion of Chiang's army revolted against the war.

Chiang Kai-shek originally planned to launch the Jinpu Railway operation in early August, opening the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway within three weeks. However, due to numerous internal difficulties, it was delayed until August 21 when four armies attacked Taierzhuang. On September 2, Chiang's army occupied Taierzhuang, trapped for a month, and dared not move forward. Chiang also ordered Wang Yaowu to open the Jiaoji Railway in mid-August, but in the battle of Zouping Wenzu, our army captured alive Liu Shizhen, commander of the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 15th Division of his 96th Army, and more than 1,400 men, killing and wounding 2,000. The entire 1st Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Corps of Nanquan revolted, and the Jiaoji Railway has not been opened to this day.

On the southern Shanxi battlefield, Hu Zongnan launched an offensive against us with five divisions from July 4, attempting to forcibly occupy the area south of Linfen. In the Battle of Wenxi in mid-July, all of Hu's 33rd Division was annihilated, and its commander Liu Zhaoming escaped with his life and was also dismissed. Hu's 167th Division and Yan Xishan's 72nd Division were both severely damaged. After the victory of Wenxi, our army turned to counter-offensive and captured five cities: Xidong, Zhaocheng, Huoxian, Lingshi, and Fenxi, controlling more than 240 miles of the Tongpu Railway, connecting the Lvliang and Taiyue Liberated Areas into one. Yan's main force, the Provisional 39th Division, was completely wiped out in the Battle of Zhao, and most of the Provisional 44th Division and the 69th Division were annihilated. On August 14, Hu Zongnan transferred two divisions of the 30th Army from northern Henan to southern Shanxi and advanced again. From Houma to Linfen was only more than 100 miles, and Hu's army advanced for a month before sneaking into Linfen with the support of Yan's army. When Hu's elite 1st Division (Brigade) had just entered the vicinity of Fushan, our army completely annihilated it on the 24th, capturing the division commander Huang Zhengcheng alive, and parts of the 167th Division and the 27th Division were also defeated.

In the northern section of Tongpu, in order to stop the constant invasion of Yan's puppet army, we launched a counterattack in early July, liberating nine cities in a month and a half: Shuoxian, Ningwu, Huairen, Shanyin, Daixian, Zhixian, Fanshi, Wutai, and Dingxiang, controlling more than 620 miles of the Tongpu Railway from Gao Village to the South Gate of Datong. More than 8,000 of Yan's troops were annihilated, and the habitual bandit Qiao Richeng was killed. Chiang Kai-shek took advantage of Yan's crisis and assigned Datong to Fu Zuoyi's 12th War Zone, luring him to send troops to eastern Suiyuan to cooperate with his offensive in Hebei-Rehe, and assigned the area east of Yuci on the Zhengtai Railway and the area south of Linfen on the Tongpu Railway to his direct line Hu Zongnan. If Yan Xishan continues to assist Chiang in the civil war, there is obviously no way out.

Fu Zuoyi's troops, under the inducement and coercion of Chiang Kai-shek, were willing to be lackeys of the dictator. On September 10, they launched an all-out attack on Jining. Our army annihilated the entire Provisional 11th Division in the suburbs of Jining and severely damaged its Provisional 17th Division, New 31st Division, New 32nd Division, and 101st Division. On the 14th, our army voluntarily withdrew from Jining. Fu Zuoyi did not repent and continued to occupy our Fengzhen and Liangcheng.

In early August, Chiang's army in Hebei-Rehe was ordered to attack Chengde, open the Pingjin Railway, and "mop up" eastern Hebei to cooperate with the Northeast operations. Therefore, 17 divisions launched a fierce attack on our Rehe and eastern Hebei. Our army lured the enemy deep and voluntarily withdrew from 16 cities including Chengde and Zunhua, and then turned to counter-offensive, accumulating small victories into big ones.

In these three months, since Chiang's army could not win in the Pass, it had to temporarily put aside its plan to invade Harbin and Andong, and the Northeast was temporarily in a state of silence. However, Chiang's army also launched small offenses in Ximucheng, Huinan, Huadian and other places, all of which were repelled by the Northeast Democratic Allied Army.

In total, in the past three months, we have annihilated the entire 49th Army and 10th Army of Chiang's army, as well as 15 divisions (brigades) including the 26th, 79th, 105th, 187th, New 7th, 99th, 19th, 92nd, 31st, 181st, Provisional 39th, 20th, 3rd, Provisional 11th, and 1st, as well as the entire 7th and 11th Traffic Police Corps, plus 34 complete regiments, 22 battalions, 13 brigades, and 11 security regiments. Chiang's army suffered more than 58,000 wounded, more than 35,000 killed, and more than 95,000 captured, capturing alive 48 officers above the rank of general, including Chiang's army (division) commanders Zhao Xitian, division (brigade) commanders Huang Zhengcheng, Zhu Zhixi, Liang Cailin, deputy division (brigade) commanders Xi Shengkai, Jin Ya'an, Tian Yunbiao, Mai Xiachong, Liu Guangguo, Wang Ying, etc., killed deputy army commander Wang Kejun, wounded division commanders Tan XX, Hu Changqing, and countless officers below the regimental level wounded and captured. There were 22 uprisings of more than 13,000 people who were unwilling to sacrifice for the US-Chiang alliance. In total, Chiang's army lost more than 221,000 troops, accounting for more than 12% of the total number of Chiang's troops attacking the liberated areas. The large number of captures by local armed forces and militias in various liberated areas is not included. According to known news, at least seven Chiang's army generals above the rank of army commander, including Liu Zhi, were punished by Chiang Kai-shek for military failures.

Among the annihilated Chiang's troops, Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops were the best equipped but the weakest in combat power, and were also the most annihilated, accounting for more than 70% of the total number annihilated. Except for a few lackeys (such as Fu Zuoyi), the miscellaneous troops generally were not active in combat and were unwilling to fight for Chiang Kai-shek and his American foreign fathers.

In three months, Chiang Kai-shek occupied 44 of our liberated cities (occupying a total of 61 of our cities, and our army liberated another 17 cities). On average, Chiang's army paid the price of 5,000 people for each city occupied. The comparison between the losses of Chiang's army and our army is eight to one, and in the Central Jiangsu Campaign it reached seventeen to one. According to incomplete statistics, we captured more than 50,000 rifles and carbines, more than 4,800 light and heavy machine guns, more than 700 grenade launchers, more than 700 artillery pieces of various calibers, 57 rocket launchers, 18 tanks, 66 military vehicles, 7 locomotives, more than 20 million rounds of various ammunition, 1,300 mules and horses, 18 radio stations, and countless other captured items. Most of the items captured in Central China, Southern Shanxi, and Hebei-Rehe were American equipment.

The summary of the three-month war of self-defense clearly tells Chiang Kai-shek, and also tells the American imperialists, that wanting to destroy the main force of the People's Liberation Army within half a year and eliminate all liberated areas and democratic forces within a year is just a good dream of the American reactionaries and Chiang Kai-shek! The troops and civilians in the liberated areas are mobilizing, becoming stronger as they fight, while Chiang Kai-shek's army is anti-war in morale, opposed by the people, suffering from economic panic, insufficient troops, dispersed troops, unstable rear, becoming weaker as they fight, and with exhausted reserves, eliminating one means one less. The People's Liberation Army is fully capable of eliminating more of Chiang's army's living forces in the future, completely crushing Chiang Kai-shek's current offensive, recovering all the towns temporarily occupied by Chiang's army, and giving a lesson to the American imperialists who attempt to turn China into a colony, and giving a lesson to Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Kuomintang reactionaries!

　　三个月自卫战概述
    由于中华民国政府积极帮助下，六月下旬发动了空前规模的内战，企图在半年内摧毁人民解放军的主力，一年内肃清一切解放区和民主力量。现已时过三月，蒋介石究竟得到了些什么呢？一月十四日，蒋军占我光山县城后，即以卅万众包围我中原军区主力，压缩我军于宣化店周围纵横百二十里之地区。六月中旬，蒋介石亲下手令，限于六月二十五日进攻，六月三十日聚歼我军。中原我军奋起突围，于二十九日晚粉碎平汉路封锁，大举西进。中原我军的行动，使蒋介石的阴谋受到惨败。蒋介石羞愤成怒，六十六军军长宋瑞珂、十五军军长武庭麟都受到蒋介石的申斥。此后，蒋军对我中原军连续追击一个半月，终于望尘莫及，旦遭我军重大杀伤。现我中原军主力已在豫鄂陕边境创造新的解放区，我王震、皮定钧、张体学等部则分别进入了陕甘宁、华中，大别山等地，我散布平汉路东西之游击队，乃牵制蒋军五个师的兵力。此次突围，我已胜利达成战略转移目的，从宣化店地区被包围的状态中解放出来。蒋军则不但一无所获，反而招致了巨大的损失。如赵锡田之第十军，原有万五千余人，在追击中亡及逃跑即达六七千人，四十一、四十七、十五、七十二、七十五等军莫不减员甚大。因此七十二军军长傅翼，七十五军军长柳际明及其以下团营长，被蒋介石撤职处分者甚多。总计中原战役，蒋军军长一级受处分者即达四人之多。
    蒋介石借口苏北我军“威胁京沪安全”，用二十个师的兵力及海空军大部，于七月十五日发动对苏北之联合进攻，企图血洗我苏皖边区，杀人魔王陈诚则扬言要“武力决赛”。苏中我军奋起自卫，在粟裕、谭震林将军指挥下，一个半月中七战七捷，蒋军七个师（旅），两个交通警察总队，共六万余人全部被歼，残部被困于如皋、海安、黄桥等少数据点。指挥苏中蒋军作战的李默庵被蒋撤职，由抗战中以败将著名的汤恩伯继任。淮北蒋军九十二师被全部消灭，于是九十二军军长梁汉民受到“撤职”的处分。蒋以苏中惨败，乃改变计划，由徐州宿县进窥两淮，我军予蒋军重大杀伤后，九月十九、二十一日撤出两淮。从此蒋军兵力更加分散，后方联络线更长，粟裕将军所说：“两淮将是蒋军的坟墓”是一定会灵验的。
    为粉碎蒋对我豫东解放区的进攻，策应苏北中原我军之自卫，我冀鲁豫军民于八月十日出击陇海线，四天之内连克兰封砀山等五城，控制陇海路三百五十余里，歼灭蒋军一八一师（仅师长米文和化装潜逃），并予十八军及二十九师、七十四师以重大杀伤。九月初又歼灭蒋之嫡系第十军（即第三师），生擒军长赵锡田，四十一、四十七两军（师）亦被打得七零八落。国民党郑州绥署主任刘峙因此被蒋介石于九月十五日撤职，由皖南事变祸首顾祝同接替。顾到任后，复驱败绩之师与由徐州砀山出犯之第五军邱清泉部、整十一师胡琏部侵犯我定陶、荷泽（曹州）地区，我诱敌深入，主动退出荷泽。陇海路南之我军劲旅乃克复太康、淮阳，并解放了广大区域，有力的配合路北作战。豫北我军亦于八月初发动自卫，以三昼夜之激战，扫平孟县全境蒋军五十余据点，蒋军十七师一部被歼。二十一日豫北我军曾一度攻入辉县，该地蒋军一营起义反战。
    蒋介石原定于八月初发动津浦路作战，三星期内打通津浦线徐州济南段。但因内部困难重重，迟至八月二十一日始以四个军向我台儿庄出犯。九月二日蒋军侵占台儿庄，困守一月，不敢前进。蒋亦限令王耀武于八月中旬打通胶济路，然而邹平文祖一役，我军生擒其九十六军暂十五师一团团长刘士珍以下一千四百余人，毙伤两千。南泉交通警察第十五总队第一大队则全部起义，胶济路至今未能打通。
    晋南战场，胡宗南自七月四日起，即以五师之众向我进攻，企图强占临汾以南地区。七月中旬闻喜一战，胡部三十三师全部被歼，其师长刘钊铭以身免逃脱后亦被撤职。胡部一六七师及阎锡山之七十二师，均受重创。闻喜之捷后，我军转入反攻，连克冼洞、赵城、霍县、灵石、汾西五城，控制同蒲线二百四十余里，吕梁与太岳两解放区联成一片。阎军主力暂三十九师于赵战役中全军覆没，暂四十四师、六十九师大部被歼。八月十四日，胡宗南将豫北第三十军两个师调来晋南，再度前进，从侯马至临汾不过百余华里，胡军前进了一个月之久，才在阎军接应下窜入临汾。当胡军精锐第一师（旅）甫入浮山附近时，我军即于二十四日将其全部歼灭，活捉师长黄正成，一六七师、二十七师一部亦被击溃。
    同蒲北段，我为制止阎伪军不断侵犯，于七月初进行反击，一个半月中解放朔县、宁武、怀仁、山阴、代县、峙县、繁峙、五台、定襄九城，控制同蒲线高村至大同南关六百二十余里，阎军被歼八千余人，惯匪乔日成被击毙。蒋介石乃乘阎之危，将大同划归傅作义之十二战区，诱其出兵绥东，以配合其冀热攻势，并将正太线榆次以东及同蒲线临汾以南地区划归其嫡系胡宗南。阎锡山如继续助蒋内战，显然是毫无出路的。
    傅作义部在蒋介石的诱胁之下，甘为独裁者走狗，于九月十日倾巢犯我集宁，我军歼其暂十一师全部于集宁城郊，并痛创其暂十七师、新三十一师、新三十二师、一○一师。十四日我军主动撤出集宁，傅作义不知悔悟，继续侵占我丰镇、凉城。
    冀热蒋军八月初即受命进攻承德，打通平锦线，并“扫荡”冀东以配合东北作战，故以十七个师分向我热河、冀东猛犯，我军诱敌深入，主动撤出承德、遵化等十六城，接着转入反攻，积小胜为大胜。
    在这三个月中，蒋军既在关内无法取胜，仍不得不暂时搁置其进犯哈尔滨、安东的计划，东北暂呈沉寂状态。但蒋军亦在析木城、辉南、桦甸等地有小的出犯，均为东北民主联军击退。
    总计三个月来，我共歼灭蒋军第四十九军、第十军两个军全部及二十六、七十九、一○五、一八七、新七、九十九、十九、九十二、三十一、一八一、暂三十九、二十、第三、暂十一、第一等十五个师（旅），及交通警察第七、第十一两个总队全部，另三十四个整团，二十二个营，十三个旅，十一个保安团。蒋军计伤五万八千余，毙三万五千余，被俘九万五千余，生擒将级以上军官四十八名，包括蒋军军（师）长赵锡田、师（旅）长黄正成、朱志席、梁彩林，副师（旅）长洗盛楷、金亚安、田云彪、麦霞冲、刘光国、王瑛等，击毙副军长王克俊，击伤师长谭×达、胡长清，团以下军官伤亡被俘者无算。不愿为美蒋牺牲而起义者，共二十二起，一万三千余人。总计蒋军损失兵力共二十二万一千余人，占进攻解放区蒋军全数百分之十二强。各解放区地方武装与民兵之大量俘获尚不在内。据已知的消息，因军事失败而受到蒋介石处分的蒋军军长以上的将领即有刘峙等七人。
    在被歼的蒋军中，蒋介石嫡系武装最好，武斗力却最弱，被歼亦最多，占被歼总数十分之七以上。杂牌军作战，除少数走狗（如傅作义）以外，一般均不积极，不愿为蒋介石及其美国洋爸爸作战。
    三个月中，蒋介石占我解放区四十四城（共占我六十一城，我军又解放十七城）。平均蒋军每占一城付出五千人的代价。蒋军的损失与我军损失之比较为敌八我一，在苏中战役中则达十七比一。据尚不完全的统计，我共缴获长短枪五万余支，轻重机枪四千八百余挺，掷弹筒七百余个，各种口径炮七百余门，火箭炮五十七门，坦克十八辆，军用汽车六十六辆，火车头七个，各种弹药二千余万发，骡马一千三百匹，电台十八座，击落飞机十三架，其他缴获不计其数。在华中晋南冀热等地所缴获者大部为美械。
    三个月自卫战的总结，清楚的告诉了蒋介石，也告诉了美国帝国主义者，想要半年内摧毁人民解放军的主力，一年肃清一切解放区和民主力量，只是美国反动派与蒋介石的好梦而已！解放区军民正在动员起来，愈战愈强，蒋介石则军心反战，民心反对，经济恐慌，兵力不足，兵力分散，后方不稳，愈战愈弱，而且后备枯竭，消灭一个就少一个。人民解放军完全有可能在今后更大量的消灭蒋军有生力量，彻底粉碎蒋介石的此次进攻，收复暂时被蒋军侵占的一切城镇，给企图把中国变为殖民地的美国帝国主义者以教训，给国民党反动派头子蒋介石以教训！（新华社延安三日电）
