　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Seoul dispatch: The people of Southern Korea are launching a struggle against dark rule. Professors at Seoul University have been on strike since the 27th of last month to protest the U.S. military's insult of female students. Teachers and students of various middle schools and specialized schools immediately responded by going on strike, denouncing Kim Gu's betrayal of the country and the crimes of the United States. The U.S. occupation forces and the Korean puppet government have adopted a high-pressure policy, sending tanks and artillery to bloody suppress villages of insurgent farmers. In various cities, they are wantonly arresting people from democratic parties and social organizations. Li Yanguo (transliteration), Secretary-General of the Korean Democratic Front, Du Xiying (translator), and Li Zhenggu (transliteration), Secretary of the Communist Party, have all been arrested by the U.S. military. Many young male and female students have also been harmed during strikes and demonstrations. The U.S. military is particularly interested in arresting female students. A spokesman for the Democratic Front said: The Korean people have a tradition of resistance. In the past, they did not succumb to Japanese fascism, and in the future, they will not be intimidated by any high-pressure policies.
