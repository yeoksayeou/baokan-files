How Gaotang Strives for Self-Renewal of Puppet Troops

　　Gaotang's Fourth District is the area that was bloodily ruled by the traitors Pang Changshen and Guo Rongyuan for eight years. Because the traitor Pang everywhere seized men and robbed soldiers, many young people were forced to become puppet troops. In the entire district of sixty-nine villages, more than 850 people had been puppet soldiers. Half of the youths in Mengzhuang had been puppet soldiers. Pang's control over them was extremely strict. For several years they could not return home to see their families. It was also a case of "one inside the stronghold, one outside the stronghold," separated by two or three moats. If they were not careful and said a few "offensive" words, they would be secretly reported to Pang and suffer the tragedy of being shot or buried alive. Under Pang's blockade and deceptive propaganda, they did not understand our policies, and thought that they would be beheaded as soon as they were captured by the Eighth Route Army. Their lives were extremely painful, but they could not find a way out.

　　After the liberation of Gaotang on July 7th, most of them fled in all directions, seeking refuge with relatives and friends, and hiding. Only a few hid at home, and they were difficult to find. In order to save these young people and cooperate with the mass movement, we launched a self-renewal campaign for the puppet troops last month. After half a month of effort, it has generally come to a victorious conclusion. Of the puppet troops in the entire district, excluding those captured, killed, escaped to other areas, and still serving as puppet troops during the war, about 300 people, the remaining 550 people have already renewed themselves and handed over 2 mortars, 7 machine guns, and 360 rifles and short guns. Regarding the organization of the puppet troops' self-renewal, we have drawn the following points of experience: First, vigorously publicize the lenient policy of "handing over guns and repenting, past offenses will not be investigated," shatter the enemy's deception, and encourage them to call their children, relatives, and fellow villagers home to hand over their guns, repent to the government, and live a peaceful life at home. If someone comes to hand over their guns and renew themselves, they should be released immediately. Even unimportant puppet middle and lower-level officers should be released immediately. As a result of doing so, the masses generally reflected: "What the Eighth Route Army says, it does; it is consistent in word and deed." Especially after releasing 40 puppet company-level and below non-commissioned officers, others said, "Even the company commander is alright, what are we lowly soldiers afraid of?" Thus, the number of people going to the district to repent increased day by day. Second, there must be strength as a backing, and special agent activities must be cracked down on in a timely manner. Some of the puppet troops are willing to hand over their guns and go home, but some are afraid that the enemy will come again and their personal lives and families will be harmed, or they are deceived by the enemy and unwilling to hand over their guns; some even act as special agents, threatening those who want to repent and those who have already repented. We must crack down on these people in a timely manner in order to further win over fence-sitters and centrists. For example, the traitor Pang Shizhong accepted orders from the traitor Pang to lead his trusted special agents to organize assassination squads, collecting hidden puppet troops everywhere in an attempt to revive. The masses and the already repentant puppet troops were panicked, and those who wanted to repent but had not yet repented became even more shaken. We immediately equipped ourselves with arms, combined with the militia, implemented political disintegration and armed suppression, eliminated them, and the task of winning over the puppet troops was successfully completed. Third, use repentant puppet troops to win over other puppet troops to renew themselves. This requires us to boldly use the already self-renewed puppet troops to promote them to connect with and win over other puppet troops. This method has yielded good results for us. The surrender of Xiao Ge and Xing Fengqian's troops in the Fourth District, and the disintegration of Pang Shizhong's troops, were all done in this way. Many self-renewal elements still have a sense of loyalty and good feelings. The more we can boldly trust them, the more loyal and active they will be to us. Otherwise, they will increase their concerns and even leave a back door. Fourth, the target of the crackdown must be clear. Generally, the puppet troops who intend to repent, especially the puppet non-commissioned officers, are mostly afraid of assassination squads and the masses settling accounts. At this time, we clearly announced that the target of the crackdown was the traitor leader Pang Changshen, and we encouraged the lower levels of the puppet troops to do more good deeds and perform meritorious services to atone for their sins in front of the government and the masses. Strengthen the anti-Pang united front education among the masses, explaining that the crimes of the lower levels of the puppet troops were forced by the traitor Pang. Just as nails are hammered into wood, the hammer drives them in. The wood and nails should unite to oppose the hammer. Fifth, a small number of die-hard traitorous special agents who continue to engage in sabotage activities after repentance and repeatedly refuse to change their ways must be resolutely isolated and suppressed. Otherwise, the lenient policy will lose the sympathy of the masses, and the enemy will think that we are weak and incompetent, and become even more rampant. After repenting, Niu Changshun participated in assassination squads everywhere to collect money and weapons. After being publicly tried and executed by the masses, the public was greatly encouraged, and the special agents who took the opportunity to make trouble were demoralized. Most of the self-renewed puppet troops were very sympathetic, which further accelerated the self-renewal work. Sixth, combine with the masses, transform the reactionary village regime in a timely manner, and establish mass armed forces, so that the self-renewed feel that they have a reliance.

　　高唐如何争取伪军自新
    高唐四区是汉奸庞长申、郭荣源八年来血腥统治的地区。由于庞逆到处抓丁抢兵，青壮年被迫当伪军的极多。全区六十九个村，当过伪军的有八百五十人以上。孟庄半数青年当过伪军，庞逆对他们统治非常严厉，有好几年不能回家一趟和亲人见一面，也是“一个在据点内，一个在据点外”，隔着两三道外壕，稍不留心，说了一两句“犯上”的话，即被监视的人密报庞逆，惨遭枪毙和活埋。他们在庞逆封锁和欺骗宣传下，对我们政策不了解，以为一被八路军捉住即会杀头。他们的生活万分痛苦，但也找不着出路。
    七月七日高唐解放后，他们大部四处逃散，投亲奔友，隐避起来。只有个别的藏在家里，也很难找到。我们为了拯救这批青年，并配合群众运动，特于上月份发动伪军自新。经半月努力的结果，大体上已胜利结束。全区伪军除战时被俘、死亡、逃亡他区和仍在伪军者约三百人外，其余五百五十人业已自新，并交出迫击炮两门、机枪七挺、长短枪三百六十支。关于组织伪军自新，我们得出几点经验如下：一、大力宣传“交枪悔过、既往不究”的宽大政策，粉碎敌人欺骗，并推动他们把自己子弟与亲戚老乡叫回家，向政府交枪悔过，回家过太平日子。有人来交枪自新，即要马上释放。甚至不重要的伪中下级军官，也马上释放，这样做的结果，群众一般反映：“八路说的出，办的到，心口如一”。特别在释放了伪连级以下四十名士官以后，其他人都说：“人家当连长的还没事哩，咱一个当小兵的怕啥？”于是相率到区悔过者，日益增多。二、必须有力量作后盾，并及时打击特务活动。伪军中有一部分人愿意交枪回家，但也有一部分怕敌人再来，个人生命与家庭被害，或受敌欺骗，不愿缴枪；甚至充当特务，威胁想悔过与已悔过的人，对这种人必须及时打击，才能进一步争取观望分子和中间派。如汉奸庞士忠接受庞逆命令，率其亲信特务组织暗杀团，到处收罗隐避的伪军，企图死灰复燃，群众和已悔过的伪军发生恐慌，想悔过而未悔过的更加动摇，我们马上配备武装，结合民兵，实行政治瓦解与武装镇压，将其消灭，争取伪军任务遂得胜利完成。三、以悔过伪军争取伪军自新。这要我们大胆使用对已自新之伪军，推动他们串连与争取其他伪军。这个方法曾使我们收到很好效果。四区小鸽部、邢凤千部的投诚，庞士忠部的瓦解，都是这样搞的。有不少自新分子尚义气，好感情，对他们越能大胆信任，他们对我越忠实，越积极。否则他们就会增加顾虑，甚至留后手。四、打击的目标要明确。一般打算悔过的伪军，特别是伪士官，多半怕暗杀团、怕群众算账，这时我们明确宣布打击的目标是汉奸头子庞长申，对一般伪军则鼓励他们在政府与群众面前多做好事，立功赎罪。在群众中加强反庞统一战线教育，说明伪军下层的罪恶是庞逆强迫做的。正如钉子钉到木头上，是锤子打进去的，木头和钉子应联合起来反锤子。五、对少数悔过后又进行破坏活动、屡劝不改的死心汉奸特务。必须坚决孤立与镇压。否则就会使宽大政策失掉群众同情，使敌人认为我们软弱无能，更加猖狂。牛长顺在悔过后又参加暗杀团到处催款起枪，经群众公审、处决后，群情大为振奋，趁机作乱的特务分子却情绪低落。大部自新伪军均极同情，更加速了自新工作的进行。六、与群众结合起来，及时改造反动村政权，建立群众武装，使自新者觉得自己有依靠。
