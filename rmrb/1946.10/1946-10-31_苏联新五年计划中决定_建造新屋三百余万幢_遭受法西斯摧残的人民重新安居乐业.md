Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Moscow News: The village of Chapayevka in Ukraine was severely damaged by the German invaders, but as early as the autumn of 1943, the village began its revival. When the Red Army's artillery fire was still frequent, the sound of axes and hammers was already ringing in the ruins of Chapayevka village. With the help of Soviet government loans and building materials such as timber, after two and a half years of intense work, a new Chapayevka village has now emerged. Along the wide roads, 220 new houses have been built, surrounded by birch trees, and each farmer has planted more than 15 apple, pear, cherry, and plum trees. The newly built power plant has restored light to the entire village, the middle school has reopened, and the club has also resumed activities. Cinemas and theaters are being rebuilt. The process of Chapayevka's revival can be regarded as typical of thousands of Soviet villages. The German invaders reduced six million Soviet buildings to ashes, leaving 25 million people homeless. The new five-year plan has decided to build 3.4 million new houses, of which 2.24 million will be built in formerly occupied areas. As early as 1945, the Ukrainian Republic had repaired and newly built 155,000 houses, and Belarus had built 200,000 new houses, enabling 900,000 farmers to live and work in peace. In the Russian Republic, approximately 600,000 new houses have been built, and 2.5 million farmers have moved into new homes.

　　苏联新五年计划中决定
    建造新屋三百余万幢
    遭受法西斯摧残的人民重新安居乐业
    【新华社延安二十二日电】莫斯科讯：乌克兰夏伯也夫卡村曾经过德寇的猛烈破坏，但还在一九四三年秋，该村便开始复兴工作。当红军炮声尚频频传来时，夏伯也夫卡村废墟上，已响着斧凿板钉之声了。在苏联政府借款、木材等建筑材料的帮助下，经过二年半的紧张工作后，现在又出现一个新的夏伯也夫卡村了。沿着宽坦的马路旁，建造了二百二十幢新屋，四周围以桦树，每一农家栽植十五株以上的苹果、梨、樱桃、李树等。不久前新造的电力厂，使全村重现光明，中学已开学，俱乐部也已恢复活动，电影院、剧场都在重建中。夏伯也夫卡村复兴的过程，可作为苏联千万农村的典型。德寇曾使苏联六百万幢建筑化为灰烬，使二千五百万人民无家可归，新五年计划决定建造三百四十万幢新屋，其中建筑在曾是沦陷区内的有二百二十四万幢。还在一九四五年，乌克兰共和国就修复和新造了十五万五千幢住屋，白俄罗斯已建了二十万所新屋，九十万农民得以安居乐业。在俄罗斯共和国，新建了约六十万幢新屋，有二百五十万农民已迁入新居。
