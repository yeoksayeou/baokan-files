　　Zhou Wuzhe Raises Pigs and Transforms from Destitute to Prosperous Middle Peasant in Five Years
　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from Changzhi, 26th] Zhou Wuzhe, a destitute peasant from Banpo, Yushe District, became a prosperous middle peasant after raising pigs for five years. Zhou's family consists of ten people, with no land or housing. He started raising three sows in August 1941, which grew to eighteen by February 1942. During the famine of 1943, people had nothing to eat, making it even more difficult to feed the pigs. Zhou borrowed two dou of soybeans from his neighbors to make tofu. He sold the tofu to buy more soybeans, fed the soybean residue to people, and the soybean milk to the pigs. By 1944, in addition to supplementing the family's living expenses, he used the profits from raising pigs to buy a donkey, costing ten jin of millet, and saved four thousand yuan in silver. Last year alone, the large and small sows gave birth to three litters, totaling more than thirty piglets. Selling the piglets yielded a profit of 44,000 yuan. He sold two donkeys, bought fifteen mu of land, costing forty jin of millet, and supplemented the family with more than ten shi of refined grains. This year, he has had two more litters of piglets, totaling more than twenty. Selling them brought in 22,000 yuan in silver, which he used to buy five mu of land, a house, and many household furnishings. He still has eight pigs (two sows and six boars). During this year's land reform movement, he received another fifteen mu of land. He now has forty mu of land, three strong donkeys, one for grinding tofu and two for transportation, and his life has become greatly prosperous. (Liu Haisheng)
