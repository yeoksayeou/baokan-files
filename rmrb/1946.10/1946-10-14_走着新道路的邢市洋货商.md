　　Xingtai's Foreign Goods Merchants Taking a New Road
    Mu Yue
    For forty years, the shops on Beida Street in Nanguan have displayed perfume, lipstick, imported porcelain furniture, canned goods, milk powder, paints, foreign cloth, and various other foreign and Guangdong goods. They came from Tianjin and Hankou, and from Xingtai, they infiltrated the vast countryside. Imperialist commodities gradually devoured the fragile national industry and commerce. Ever since the enemy destroyed Xingtai's fur and native cloth industries, the native cloth market was completely occupied by "East Asia Cloth." This comprador capital took an absolute advantage in Xingtai. Naturally, Beida Street was "extremely prosperous for a time."
    The liberation of Xingtai changed this situation. Girls no longer wear lipstick, and native cloth has become a favorite among everyone. The nation's sense of self-respect has also gradually been promoted. When the reporter walked to Beida Street, he saw a strong contrast. Beida Street was still bustling, with native cloth vendors and flower vendors lined up on both sides of the street, and groups of villagers buying and selling native cloth and cotton. But very few people entered the foreign goods stores. The facts prove what the liberated people like.
    A vivid example illustrates the trend of the liberated area market: merchants must adapt to the needs of the people in the liberated area to make a profit. Fulin Wu Guang Goods Store withdrew 500,000 from its one million capital in the spring to invest in the Yangshi Street fur store. The recent settlement shows a profit of 1.4 to 1.5 million. It also used one-half of the remaining capital, 250,000 yuan, to buy fur itself, earning more than 2 million yuan. The remaining 250,000 yuan that was not converted was spent as it was sold, and the value of the remaining inventory, calculated at current prices, is no more than 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Because foreign and Guangdong goods are now sluggish, they are not as active as the capital for operating fur and local products. Another example is told by Zhai Zhengyi, the manager of Tianzengcheng Store. Tianzengcheng Hat Store had a turnover of 400,000 yuan in five months (January to May) before it switched to local products and towel business; after the conversion, it had a turnover of 400,000 yuan in one month. Therefore, he now realizes that selling what the people need in the liberated area will surely lead to wealth. As long as merchants serve the people, they will surely have a bright future.
    The eight years of "New Order" also educated some people who served imperialist commodities. They also tasted the bayonets and slaps of Japanese Bushido. They realized that with the goods came armed occupation. The manager of Yuchanghao, a paint store in Xingtai and Harbin, said: "The oppression of Japan and the education of the masses in the liberated areas over the past eight years have made him understand this point. He is now preparing to engage in jujube kernel business."
    It is estimated that the foreign capital operating foreign goods in Xingtai is about 800 million yuan, of which paints and some groceries are still necessary for the people in the liberated areas, worth about 300 million yuan. Therefore, the capital required for conversion should be about 500 million yuan. These funds are now used for luxury and non-essential goods. If they can be diverted to transportation and production enterprises that are beneficial to the liberated areas, they will play a great role. At present, Xingtai's industrial capital only accounts for 6.1% of the total capital. And native cloth and fur capital is also extremely weak due to the enemy's destruction, and can still accommodate a large amount of capital. According to the estimates of fur merchants, if calculated based on the 8.8 million fur transactions after liberation, the fur industry can accommodate 200 million or 300 million.
    Organizing the conversion of foreign goods merchants is a long-term and complex task, which not only requires organizing the transfer of funds, but also helping merchants learn new business knowledge and new management techniques. It is necessary to guide from the bottom up based on the merchants' own interests. When the merchants feel that it is profitable, the conversion can be carried out smoothly.

　　走着新道路的邢市洋货商
    慕岳
    四十年来摆在南关北大街商号里面的是香水、口红、洋磁家具、罐头、乳粉、颜料、洋布等各色各样的洋广杂货，它们从天津、汉口来，又从邢台侵入广大的乡村去。帝国主义的商品逐渐吞噬着脆弱的民族工商业。自从敌人摧毁了邢台的皮毛业与土布业，土布市场完全被“兴亚布”占领，这种买办性资本，更在邢台占了绝对的优势。北大街自然“极盛一时”。
    邢台解放，改变了这种情况，姑娘们已不再涂抹口红，土布成了大家喜好的东西。民族的自尊心也逐渐发扬了，记者走到北大街的时候，看到一种强烈的对比。北大街街上还是热闹的，土布贩花贩一个一个的摆在街道的两旁，乡下的老百姓一群一群的在买卖土布和棉花。但洋货商店里面却很少人进去。事实证明了解放了的人民喜欢什么。
    有一个生动的例子，说明解放区市场的动向，商人要适应解放区的人民的需要才有利可图。福林五广货行，春天从自己一百万资本里面，抽了五十万投资羊市街皮毛行。最近结算，获利一百四五十万。又以其余资本的二分之一二十五万元自己收买皮毛，赚洋二百余万。而剩下没有转业的二十五万，随卖随吃，卖了花了，存货按现在物价计算最多也不过五六十万。因为洋广杂货现在疲了，没有经营皮毛土产资本那样活跃。还有一个例子是天增成号经理翟正义讲的，天增成帽行在没有转营土产毛巾时，五个月中（一月至五月）一共做了四十万流水；转业后一个月，就做了四十万流水。因此，他现在体验到了，在解放区贩卖老百姓需要的东西没有不发财的。商人只要为人民服务，必定有光明的前途。
    八年的“新秩序”，也教育了若干为帝国主义商品服务的人们，他们也尝到了日本武士道的枪刺与耳光。认识到随着商品而来的，便是武装的占领，邢市哈尔滨颜料行玉昌号的经理说：“八年来日本的压迫，和解放区群众的教育使他了解这一点，他现在准备经营枣仁。”
    据估计邢市经营洋货的外资，约在八万万左右，其中颜料及一部杂货，仍为解放区人民所必需，约值三万万元。因此需要转业的资金，当在五万万左右。这些资金，现在都是奢侈品非必需品，假若能使之转向于解放区有利的运销与生产事业，当起很大的作用。现在邢市工业资金，仅占资金总额的百分之六·一。而土布、皮毛由于敌人的摧毁资金也极微弱，还可容纳大量的资金，据皮毛商的估计，如以解放后皮货成交数百八十万张计，皮毛业即可容纳两万万或三万万。
    组织洋广货商人转业是一个长期复杂的工作，不仅要组织资金转移，还要帮助商人学习新的营业知识新的经营技术。必须从下而上的根据商人切身利益诱导，当商人觉得有利可图时，转业是可以顺利进行的。
