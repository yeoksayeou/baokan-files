[This newspaper] Yangcheng, 21st: After the Eighth Route Army recovered the Fuyi Highway and cut off the Linfu Highway, the Chiang army in Fushan was isolated and besieged by our intercepting troops and militia. On the 17th, the Fourth Company of the Second Battalion of the Eightieth Regiment of the Twenty-seventh Brigade of the Chiang army stationed in Beibu Village (more than 30 miles northwest of Fushan) went to Fushan to make contact. The First Battalion of the Eightieth Regiment of the Chiang army in Fushan City came out to support them, but they were both met with head-on blows from our troops. The Chiang army, which went to make contact, was ambushed by our pre-arranged troops east of Guanque, the place where the "First Army Under Heaven" was destroyed, and the entire company was annihilated. More than 40 people were killed, more than 30 people were captured alive, and one mortar, one heavy machine gun, seven light machine guns, five Sten submachine guns, three grenade launchers, and thirteen Chiang Kai-shek rifles were seized. The Chiang army reinforcements fled back to the city when they heard the news.

[This newspaper] Yangcheng, 21st: Militia rotation teams from Yangcheng, Shimin, Qinshui, Qinyuan and other counties in the hinterland of Taiyue have successively and automatically set off for the front line to make a comprehensive and effective resistance to the Chiang army that continues to invade. In Shimin First District, 195 militiamen automatically signed up to participate in the war. When the Qinyuan militia set off, Li Gouwang and Ren Ping, militiamen from Yaozhuang, and Li Hua, director of the Armed Forces Committee, quarreled. Their reason was: "If the stubborn army is not wiped out, the people will not be safe. We must go to the front line!" The militia self-defense forces remaining in the rear are also actively preparing for war and arranging explosions. In one week, Yangcheng Fifth District has completed 12,000 stone mines, and Sixth District has manufactured 5,000 various magnetic mines, preparing to inflict heavy casualties on the invading enemy.

[This newspaper] Yangcheng, 21st: On the Tongpu front line, our army took the initiative to withdraw to the suburbs of Huoxian County on the evening of the 15th, controlling the Lingshi-Huoxian railways and waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the enemy. On the way north, the Chiang army was strongly resisted by the vast militia guerrillas of Hongdong and Zhaocheng everywhere. On the 12th, when more than 200 Chiang soldiers invaded Yangjiazhang, they were attacked by our militia from the flank, killing two Chiang soldiers and recovering Yangjiazhang. The Chiang army could not move an inch on the front of the Tongpu line, so it was forced to flee to the west bank of the Fen River, detouring north and entering the empty city of Huoxian controlled by us.
