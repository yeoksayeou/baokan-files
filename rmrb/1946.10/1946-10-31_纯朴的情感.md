　　Pure Emotions

    (I) Inviting Chairman Mao to Eat Dumplings
    The liberated women of Li Wenzhuang in the Seventh District of Xiajin, when meeting, requested to see Chairman Mao. They said, "Comrade He from the county said that the Communist Party leader Chairman Mao helped us to turn ourselves around, and we want to see Chairman Mao." The militia captain said, "Chairman Mao isn't here, but we have a picture of Chairman Mao at the militia headquarters, you can go and see it." So the Women's Association director led everyone to the militia headquarters. When they saw the picture of Chairman Mao, they all knelt on the ground and said, "You are truly our great benefactor, you led us to turn ourselves around. When will you come to our house, we'll let you eat a good meal of dumplings." They also told each other, "This year we won't worship other gods, we'll worship Chairman Mao!" When they came out, they walked and shouted, "We've seen the Chinese Communist Party's Chairman Mao!" People on the street, in twos and threes, continuously walked into the militia headquarters to see Chairman Mao. (Xinhua News Agency, Jinnan Branch)

    (II) Conclusions from the "Thinking Meeting"
    After the joint struggle in Nanliansong achieved victory, a "thinking meeting" was held to think about the reasons for the victory. Fei Ni De Niang was the first to say, "I've lived for sixty or seventy years! All of this is the blessing brought to us by the National Salvation Association!" Wang De Niang stood up to oppose, saying, "National Salvation Association! It is led by Chairman Mao, it was Chairman Mao who pointed out the bright path for us, that's why we were able to turn ourselves around!" The militia captain then said, "Chairman Mao gives us food, is it okay if we don't reach out and take it?" Shi Mengxiang suddenly realized and said, "That can't be! Everyone has to work together!" "You see, if we hadn't organized the farmers' association this time, who would dare to go to the landlord's house to reason with them, and see if they would dare to tie you up and beat you 'without letting you eat vegetables!'"
    Everyone shouted in unison, "That's right! That's right! If Chairman Mao didn't point out the path, we'd be two eyes black and stumbling along (meaning blind)", "If we don't work, we can only watch the food and not eat it", "Everyone has to work together!" (Zhao Shaozhou)

　　纯朴的情感
    （一）请毛主席吃饺子
    夏津七区李文庄翻身的妇女们，开会的时候，要求见毛主席。她们说：“县里何同志说过，共产党领袖毛主席叫俺翻的身，俺愿意见见毛主席。”民兵队长说：“毛主席不在咱这里，俺民兵队部有一张毛主席像，你们去看看吧。”妇女会主任便领着大家到民兵队部。她们见了毛主席像，便一齐跪在地上说：“你真是俺们的大恩人，你领导俺们翻了身。你啥时候来俺家里，叫你吃一顿好饺子。”她们又互相嘱告着说：“今年不供别的神了，要供毛主席呀。”出来的时候，边走边嚷着说：“可见了中国共产党毛主席了！”街上的人们三三两两、接连不断的走进民兵队部，去见毛主席。（新华社冀南分社）
    （二）“想想会”上的结论
    南连送联合斗争胜利后，开了个想想会，想想斗争胜利的原因在那儿？费你得娘首先说道：“我活了六七十岁啦！那经过这，都是救国会给俺带来的福呀！”王得娘起来反对说：“救国会！它是毛主席领导的，还是毛主席给咱指的光明路，咱才翻身哩！”民兵队长接着说：“毛主席给咱饭，咱不伸手拿行不行？”史梦祥恍然大悟的说：“该不是！还得大家伙一齐动手才行啦！”“你看这次要不是咱组织了农会，谁敢去地主家排排理，看人家敢捆起来打你个‘不吃菜！’”
    大家伙齐声乱说道：“对呀！对呀！毛主席不指给路，咱是两眼黑突路（瞎子意思）”，“咱不动手，有饭干看着不能吃”，“还得大家伙一齐干”！（赵绍周）
