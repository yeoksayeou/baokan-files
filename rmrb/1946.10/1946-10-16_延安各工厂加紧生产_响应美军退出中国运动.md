Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 13th: Yesterday was the third day of the "U.S. Troops Out of China" Movement Week in Yan'an - Factory Activity Day. It was a rainy day, but when the reporter stepped into the sewing machines workshop of the clothing factory in the early morning, the workers were making cotton-padded clothes. Now they are processing day and night so that the new cotton clothes can be worn by the soldiers at the front as soon as possible. At the discussion meeting of the Transportation Factory the night before, the workers proposed that production and saving should be given equal importance. They planned that each shoe worker group would increase the daily output to 20 pairs, and the cotton batting group would increase from 500 jin to 1,000 jin per day. Textile workers went into the factory before dawn, and the factory's worker-guard army also began night sentry duty. Ma Jiming, a worker at the Lihua Woolen Mill, suggested adding one hour of work per day, which was approved by all workers. After hearing the report on "U.S. Military's Atrocities in China," Zhang Fengtang, an 18-year-old worker at the Xinhua Chemical Factory, said, "The U.S. military is ravaging Chinese women like this, how can China still be polite to it!" All workers donated half a month's salary on the spot to the government to supply the self-defense war. The Central Printing Factory held a factory-wide workers' meeting last night, unanimously proposing to work with peace of mind and support the front. Most workers donated half a month's salary and launched a signature campaign to comfort the soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 12th: Yesterday was the activity day for institutions and schools in Yan'an to participate in the "U.S. Troops Out of China" Week. "Improving work efficiency and enriching self-defense strength" is what they are striving to practice in various positions. The General Health Department of the 18th Group Army held a general meeting, and Minister Fu Lianting called on everyone to use actions to save the new national crisis. Yan'an University, the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xingzhi Middle School, the Border Government and other institutions and schools, invited celebrities to report on current affairs, and discussed the U.S. policy towards China and the domestic situation to strengthen their understanding of the current situation.

　　延安各工厂加紧生产
    响应美军退出中国运动
    【新华社延安十三日电】昨日延市响应美军退出中国运动周第三日——工厂活动日，是日阴雨，清晨记者踏进被服厂机器间时，工人们正制棉衣，现在他们是日夜加工，以便新棉衣早日穿在前方将士身上。交通工厂前晚座谈会上，工人们提出生产与节约并重，他们计划鞋工组每人每天产量提高到二十双，弹花组每天由五百斤提高到一千斤，纺织工人黎明前即走进工厂，全厂工卫军夜晚放哨亦已开始。利华毛织工厂工人马继明提议，每天增加工作一小时，得到全体工人赞同。新华化学厂工人听了“美军在华暴行”报告后，一位十八岁的工人张凤堂说：“美军这样糟踏中国妇女，中国难道还能对它客气”！全体工人当场以半月工资捐献政府供给自卫战争。中央印刷厂昨晚召开全厂工人大会，一致提出要安心工作，支援前线，多数工人皆捐献半月工资，并发起签名劳军运动。
    【新华社延安十二日电】昨日为延安参加美军“退出中国”周之机关学校活动日，“提高工作效能，充实自卫力量”，在各种岗位上他们正在努力实践这一号召。十八集团军总卫生部召开全体大会，傅连队部长号召大家用行动来挽救新的民族危机。延安大学、中共中央党校、行知中学、边府等机关学校，纷请名人报告时事，并讨论美国对华政策及国内形势，加强对时局认识。
