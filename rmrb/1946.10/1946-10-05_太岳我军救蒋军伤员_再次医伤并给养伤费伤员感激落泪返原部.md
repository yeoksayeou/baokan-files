Taiyue Our Army Saves Chiang's Army Wounded
    Re-treats Wounds and Gives Subsistence Money, Wounded Soldiers Return to Original Unit in Tears of Gratitude
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 2nd dispatch] After our army recovered Guanque, Linfen on the night of the 23rd of last month, more than 20 wounded soldiers abandoned by Hu Zongnan's First Brigade were discovered in Beitizhi nearby. Our Eighth Route Army field medical team immediately applied medicine to bandage their wounds and cordially treated them with white flour tea. The next day, Hu Zongnan's First Division, 167th Brigade, fiercely attacked Beitizhi Village again. When our army was forced to move, they gave each of these wounded soldiers 1,500 yuan for recuperation, allowing them to wait for Hu's army to take them in. On the 25th, after Hu's army retreated in defeat, our medical team met them again for the second time. The wounded soldiers cried loudly and said, "The 167th Brigade came, and our throats are hoarse from crying, but no one gave us a drop of water! Please, Eighth Route Army, save us again!" These wounded soldiers were left unattended for a whole day and night, and their wounds were infested with maggots and were unbearably painful. On the same day, the Linfen Democratic County Government also heard the news and specially sent several large carts to send them back to their original unit in Linfen City. Before leaving, they also gave each person 2,000 yuan for travel expenses. The wounded soldiers were moved to tears. As the cart traveled halfway, two wounded soldiers secretly turned back, firmly demanding to return and join the Eighth Route Army.

　　太岳我军救蒋军伤员
    再次医伤并给养伤费伤员感激落泪返原部
    【本报阳城二日电】我军于上月二十三日夜收复临汾官雀后，在附近之北遆发现胡宗南第一旅遗弃之伤兵二十余名，我八路军战地卫生队立即为其上药包扎伤口，并以白面茶水殷勤招待，次日胡宗南之第一师一六七旅，复向北遆村猛攻，我军被迫转移时，发给这些伤兵每人一千五百元休养费，让其等待胡军收容。廿五日，胡军溃退后，我卫生队第二次又遇见他们，众伤兵嚎啕大哭说：“一六七旅来了，我们的喉咙都哭哑了也没有人给一口水喝！请八路军再救救我们吧！”这些伤兵一昼夜无人照管，伤口被蝇蛆侵蚀、疼痛难忍。当日临汾民主县政府亦闻讯，特派大车数辆将他们送回临汾城原部，临行时又发给每人二千元路费。伤兵们感激落泪，待车行至中途，有两名伤兵暗地折回，坚决要求返回参加八路军。
