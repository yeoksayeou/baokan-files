　　Xinhua Company's Entire Staff
    Saves Money to Support the Troops
    [Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo, 26th] The entire staff of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine (Xinhua Company), numbering over 170, enthusiastically saved money to support the troops and aid the front lines. New staff members (cadres from the War of Resistance era), including Wang Qi and 41 others, proposed reducing their salary by 20 to 140 catties of rice per person, amounting to over 50,000 yuan in Hebei currency. Veteran staff members (those who were already working at the company), such as Liu Chenglu and Xie Dajun, also proposed reducing their salaries to support the troops. Deputy Manager Chen immediately explained to everyone, "The veteran staff members have large families, and their property was looted by the enemy in the past, leaving their households not yet well established. For the time being, it is not necessary to reduce their salaries. Exceptions will be made for those who have no concerns about their livelihoods and voluntarily request a salary reduction." At the same time, he expressed the hope that everyone would work hard, pay attention to frugality, and actively establish revolutionary households. He also criticized the past wastefulness in the factory (such as the printing department, whose monthly expenses amounted to 700,000 to 800,000 yuan). After discussions in various departments and sections, a detailed plan for frugality was formulated. Veteran staff members began mobilizing their families to spin and weave to save money, preparing to donate funds to support the front lines. The work enthusiasm of the entire mine's staff has also increased compared to before.

　　新华公司全体职员
    节约劳军
    【本报焦作二十六日讯】焦作煤矿（新华公司）全体职员一百七十余人，踊跃节约劳军，支援前线，新职员（抗战时代干部）王奇等四十二人，提出每人减少二十斤至一百四十斤薪金米，合冀钞洋五万余元。旧职员（原在公司工作者）刘成禄谢大均等亦提出减薪劳军，陈副经理当即向大家解释：“旧职员家口很多，过去敌人在时家产被掠夺一空，家务至今尚未很好建立，暂时不必减薪。如无生活顾虑，并自求减薪者例外”，同时希望大家努力工作，注意节约，积极建立革命家务，并对过去工厂浪费现象（如文印股每月开支即需七八十万）提出批评。会后经各处各股分别讨论，订出详细节约计划，旧职员开始动员自己的家属纺织节约，准备献金支援前线。全矿职员工作情绪亦较前提高。
