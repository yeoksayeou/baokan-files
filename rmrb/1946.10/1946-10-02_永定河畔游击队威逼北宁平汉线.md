Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 28th: In the areas occupied by Chiang's troops on both sides of the Yongding River in central Hebei, people's self-defense guerrilla warfare is flourishing, threatening the Beining-Tianjin section and the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. On the 14th, a certain unit of the guerrilla force fiercely attacked Xushulin (five miles south of Yundai), west of Lixian Town (southwest of Anding Station on the Beining Railway). The next day, more than 200 Chiang's troops from Yundai Town came to reinforce, but were completely annihilated by the guerrilla ambush. The Chiang's troops in Xihulin fled at about 11:00 PM. In these two battles, a total of 83 Chiang's troops were killed or wounded, and two American-style light machine guns and 67 rifles were captured. On the 17th, the Eighth Route Army Guerrilla Corps near the Pinghan Railway on the west bank of the Yongding River directly attacked the Chiang's army stronghold in Gongyizhuang, 15 miles southeast of Liangxiang City. The next day, after defeating several waves of Chiang's reinforcements from places like Lucheng Jiaodao Town, they seized the opportunity to liberate Gongyizhuang. In this battle, more than 80 Chiang's troops were annihilated, and one machine gun and more than 60 rifles were captured. The Yongding River Daxing local armed forces bravely defended the northern part of the Hebei-Central Hebei liberated area. In the past four months, they have annihilated 179 Chiang's officers and soldiers below the battalion commander level, captured 69 alive, and seized five American-style submachine guns, one automatic rifle, 76 rifles, and more than 15,000 rounds of ammunition.

Xinhua News Agency, Nantong, 28th: The people's self-defense armed forces in the Haimen area on the north bank of the Yangtze River in central Jiangsu have repeatedly struck blows at Chiang's troops and the Chiang regime. On the 8th of this month, Xu Baorong, the Kuomintang's Haimen County First District Chief (a notorious bandit in Haimen who once served as the puppet xxx chief), led more than 40 men to Lianyuan Town (ten miles northwest of Haimen) to loot. The local people's armed forces ambushed them, killing Xu, capturing three, killing or wounding four, and seizing one light machine gun and five rifles. On the 18th, Liu Daoping, the Kuomintang Haimen County Magistrate, personally led the county security regiment and the "Returning Home Corps," a total of more than 400 people, to harass the Dahong Town area, 20 miles east of the city. The local militia district teams, in coordination with a part of the Haimen Self-Defense Regiment, fought back, and after several hours of fierce fighting, repelled them all, capturing ten soldiers of Liu's unit alive and seizing five rifles.
