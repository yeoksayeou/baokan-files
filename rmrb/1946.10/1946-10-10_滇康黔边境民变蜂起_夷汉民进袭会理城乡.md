　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: According to a disclosure in the Chongqing Kuomintang Gazette on September 18th, the Yi and Han people's rebel forces under Lu Xiqi, which have grown significantly in the Yunnan-Kangding border area, recently attacked and invaded six townships, including Jiucaidi, Leijiawan, and Qiantangzi, outside the city of Huidong in Kangding, causing alarm in the county seat. This force had long resided in Qiaojia County on the Kangding-Yunnan border. In the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], the Qiaojia County Magistrate appointed Lu Xiqi as the head of Yanxing Township. At that time, the force had expanded to 30 squads, equipped with machine guns, mortars, etc., and had combined with Han people to form an armed force of over a thousand people. Furthermore, according to a report from the Beiping Xinsheng Daily in Chengdu on September 14th, the Yi people's armed forces near Leibo, Sichuan, have recently launched attacks on Hailian Township and the Huanghai area of that county.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: According to a report in the Guiyang edition of the Central Daily News in early August, people's armed uprisings have emerged in Jinsha, Dading, Zhijin, Qianxi, and other counties in northwestern Guizhou. One of these forces, located at the junction of Qianxi and Jinsha, has over a hundred people, is fully equipped with guns and ammunition, and possesses superior weapons such as quick-firing rifles. On the evening of July 31st, dozens of people from the rebel forces charged into the streets of Jinsha, causing alarm throughout the county. They engaged in a fierce battle with the county police at Jiangyan Bridge for over an hour before retreating.
