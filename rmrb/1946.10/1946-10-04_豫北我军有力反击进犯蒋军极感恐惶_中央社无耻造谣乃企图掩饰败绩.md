　　Our Army in Northern Henan Powerfully Counterattacks Invading Chiang Troops, Who Feel Extremely Terrified
    Central News Agency Shamelessly Spreads Rumors in Attempt to Cover Up Defeats
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 2nd Dispatch] The Kuomintang propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, has made countless false broadcasts about the military situation in northern Henan in recent days. A dispatch from Baoding on the 25th claimed: "Liu Bocheng's troops of the Taihang Military Region, numbering more than 40,000, are confronting the National Army in Shuangmiao, Cixian." On the 27th, it also said: "The National Army has captured Liuhegou, etc." A commentator from the Military Region pointed out: "At present, the Chiang's puppet troops on the front line around Qugou, Anyang, are still fifty or sixty *li* away from our Liuhegou, and even further away from Shuangmiao, Cixian. How could they have been captured and confronted?" The purpose of the Kuomintang's rumor propaganda this time is to create a smokescreen to confuse the people of the whole country and to cover up the panic caused by the self-defense counterattacks of our army in northern Henan. The commentator continued: "Since the middle of this month, our army in northern Henan has launched fierce self-defense counterattacks against the Xinxiang-Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway. Under the combined attack of the military and civilians in our eastern and western liberated areas, entire battalions and companies of the Chiang's puppet troops have been wiped out; more than a dozen strongholds along the railway have also been captured by us; many bunkers and iron bridges have been destroyed by us, and Chiang Kai-shek's civil war military transport has all been forced to stop. The rear of the Chiang's troops of the 40th Division, 85th Division, and 32nd Division, which were transferred to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, has been held back by us, causing extreme panic among the Chiang's troops in northern Henan. The Central News Agency has to use deceptive propaganda to boost its morale, but the Chiang Kai-shek clique will never be willing to accept this until the entire army is annihilated. Therefore, the military and civilians of our entire region must raise their vigilance, strengthen preparations, and resolutely resist any attack by the Chiang's army against our Pinghan-Northern Hebei!"

　　豫北我军有力反击进犯蒋军极感恐惶
    中央社无耻造谣乃企图掩饰败绩
    【本报邯郸二日电】国民党宣传机关中央社对豫北军事情况连日作了无数次造谣广播，二十五日保定电讯称：太行军区刘伯承部四万余人，在磁县双庙与国军对峙，二十七日又说：国军已攻占六河沟等。军区评论员指出：目前安阳曲沟一带最前线的蒋伪军距我六河沟尚有五六十里，距磁县双庙等地更属遥远，何得攻克与对峙？国民党此次造谣宣传，其目的在于制造烟幕，以迷惑全国人心，并掩饰豫北我军自卫反击所给予的恐慌。评论员继称：自本月中旬以来，豫北我军向平汉路新（乡）安（阳）段展开了猛烈的自卫反击，该线蒋伪军在我东西解放区军民夹击下，整营整连的有生力量被歼灭；铁路沿线的十余据点亦为我攻克；碉堡铁桥，多为我炸毁，蒋介石的内战军运全部被迫停止。调赴冀鲁豫战场的蒋军四十师、八十五师、三十二师的后腿，已被我拖住，致豫北蒋军极度恐慌，中央社乃不得不以欺骗宣传鼓舞其军心，但蒋介石集团不到全军覆没，对此绝不甘心。因此我全区军民必须提高警惕，加强准备，坚决迎击蒋军向我平汉冀北的任何进攻！
