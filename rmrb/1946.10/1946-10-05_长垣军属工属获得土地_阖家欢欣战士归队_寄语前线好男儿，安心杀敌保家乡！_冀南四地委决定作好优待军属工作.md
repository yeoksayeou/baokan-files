　　[Reported by our newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 2nd] After the military and workers' families in Huangtu Village and Zhangqiuzi Road Village, Changyuan, received land, the soldiers who had returned home one after another rejoined their units. The masses of Huangtu Village, Changyuan, recovered 185 mu of land in the recent struggle to check reductions and fight against landlords. When distributing the fruits of victory, everyone unanimously agreed that: in order to allow the soldiers at the front to fight the national traitors with peace of mind, military families should be allocated more land and better land. After discussion, it was decided that regular military families would receive an average of 4.5 mu per person, local military families would receive an average of 4 mu per person, and worker's families would receive an average of 3 mu per person. Wang Tianxiang's family, a regular soldier, had six people, originally had nine mu of land, and was allocated an additional 15.4 mu. Huang Xinyi's family, a local soldier, only had one person and originally had no land, and this time was allocated 5.5 mu. The military and worker's families who received land happily said, "Send a letter to tell them to fight Chiang Kai-shek hard, the family will not go hungry, tell them not to miss home." The families of the five soldiers who had not yet returned to their units also received land, and they firmly stated that they would immediately return to their units. When Zhangqiuzi Road Village discussed distributing public fields and public property to military families, the wives of several soldiers who had returned home excitedly said, "I guarantee to mobilize my children's father to return to the unit tomorrow." In this way, the twelve soldiers who returned home all quickly and voluntarily rejoined their units.
    [Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng on the 3rd] Jincheng Seventh District fully took care of military and cadre families in the distribution of the fruits of struggle. Xia Licuan Administrative Village bore a heavy burden under enemy-puppet rule, and the land of many farmers was plundered by the maintenance society, and even more members of the anti-Japanese families lost their land and fled. This year, when distributing the fruits of victory after the mass struggle, good land and nearby land were given to military and cadre families first. Therefore, in the autumn, the 26 military families in the whole village cultivated 96 mu of grain land and harvested a total of 193 shi of grain, an increase of about four times compared with last year. Chen Yuhua, a member of a military family, harvested 4 shi of grain last year and 15 shi this year. He happily instructed the village chief to send a letter to his son saying, "The whole family is now well-fed and clothed, so don't worry, you can concentrate on defeating Chiang Kai-shek before returning."
    [Reported by our newspaper from Nangong on the 1st] The Jinnan Fourth Prefectural Committee convened a joint meeting of county party committee secretaries, county patriotic association directors, and military affairs committee directors on September 17th to review past work on preferential treatment for military families and exchange experiences in preferential treatment for military families in various places. It was decided to ensure that this work would be thoroughly done in the future, to solve all the difficulties of military families, and not to be restricted by the preferential treatment regulations. On the 20th, all the comrades attending the meeting jointly sent a letter of condolence to the military region, columns, independent regiments, and the Fifth New Brigade. Under the call of Political Commissar Qiao, they immediately began to practice frugality and save money to comfort the troops. Many comrades donated their subsidies, shoe and sock expenses, and manuscript fees. In an instant, they donated 23,000 yuan, which was immediately sent to the military region and independent regiment to be forwarded to the commanders and fighters at the front, expressing their "千里鹅毛" (a trivial gift can show great care) condolences.

　　长垣军属工属获得土地
    阖家欢欣战士归队
    寄语前线好男儿，安心杀敌保家乡！
    冀南四地委决定作好优待军属工作
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】长垣黄凸村和张秋子路村的军工属分到土地后，回家战士纷纷归队。长垣黄凸村群众在最近查减斗争中收回土地一百八十五亩，分配果实时，大家一致认为：为了使前方战士安心打卖国贼，应该给军属多分土地和分好地。经过讨论决定正规军属每人平均四亩半，地方军属每人平均四亩，工属每人平均三亩，正规军王天祥家有六口人，原有地九亩，又分得地十五亩四分。地方军黄心义家只一口，原没地，这次分得五亩半。分得土地的军工属们都欣喜的说：“捎个信叫他们好好打老蒋，家里不挨饿了，叫他不要念家。”五个没归队的战士家属也分到土地，他们坚决表示要立即归队，张秋子路村在讨论将公田公物分给军属时，有几个回家战士的老婆很激动的说：“我保证动员俺孩子爹明天就归队去。”这样回家的十二个战士都迅速自动地归了队。
    【本报阳城三日电】晋城七区在分配斗争果实中，充分照顾了军属干属。下犁川行政村在敌伪统治时负担苛重，许多农民的土地都被维持会掠去，抗属失地逃亡者更多。今年在群众斗争后分配果实时，即尽先把好地、近地分给军属干属。因此秋季全村二十六户军属，所种九十六亩谷地，共收谷一百九十三石，较去年增加约四倍。军属陈玉化去年打谷四石，今年打了十五石。他欢喜的嘱咐村长捎信给儿子说：“全家现已丰衣足食，不必惦念，你可专心打败蒋介石再回来。”
    【本报南宫一日讯】冀南四地委于九月十七日召开各县委书记、县救国会主任、武委会主任联席会议，检讨过去优待军属工作，交流各地优待军属经验。决定保证今后彻底做好这一工作，为军属解决一切困难，不受优抗条例的拘限。二十日到会全体同志联名致函慰问军区、纵队、独立团、新五旅各部队。并在乔政委号召下，立即开始实行节衣缩食，纷纷献金劳军。不少同志以津贴、鞋袜费、稿费作为献金。刹那间即献出二万三千元，当即送往军区、独立团转前方指战员，表示“千里鹅毛”的慰忱。
