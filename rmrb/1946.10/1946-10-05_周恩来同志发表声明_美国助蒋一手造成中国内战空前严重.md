Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd—According to Reuters and Associated Press Shanghai dispatch on the 1st: General Zhou Enlai declared at a press conference in Shanghai: "If Chiang Kai-shek does not stop the attack on Zhangjiakou, it will cause a national split. If the government convenes the National Assembly on its own, it will force the Chinese people to make a final decision." General Zhou requested Marshall to notify Chiang Kai-shek that "If the Kuomintang does not immediately stop the military actions against Zhangjiakou, the Chinese Communist Party will feel compelled to assume that the government is openly declaring a complete split." Zhou condemned the government's recent attempts to purchase 200 million U.S. dollars worth of American military supplies to attack the Chinese Communist Party. Currently, the government is using 206 divisions and 800 aircraft to attack the CCP areas. Zhou pointed out: "The measures of the Kuomintang government have created an unprecedentedly serious situation. This situation is mainly attributable to the United States. Without American aid, the war would not have reached such a massive scale." He also stated: "The solution to this problem lies in the U.S. government's immediate withdrawal of American troops stationed in China and the cessation of all aid to Chiang."

　　周恩来同志发表声明
    美国助蒋一手造成中国内战空前严重
    【新华社延安二日电】据路透合众社上海一日电：周恩来将军在沪记者招待会上宣称：“如果蒋介石不停止进攻张家口，则将造成全国分裂。如果政府自行召开国大，则将迫使中国人民作最后决定。”周将军曾要求马歇尔通知蒋介石说：“如果国民党不立即停止对张家口的军事行动，则中国共产党将感到不得不假定政府是公开宣布全面的分裂。”周氏谴责政府近又企图购买二万万美元之美国军火，用以进攻中国共产党。而现在政府用以进攻中共区域者，已达二百零六个师，另有八百架飞机。周氏指出：“国民党政府之措施已造成空前严重之形势。这种形势，主要归咎于美国，如无美国援助，战争不会达到如此巨大规模。”并称：“此问题之解决，端在美国政府立即撤退驻华美军，停止对蒋一切援助。”
