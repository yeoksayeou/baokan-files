　　Chiang Kai-shek's Atrocities
    Strafe Our Lucheng Villages
    [Report from this newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 26th] Yesterday (the 25th) at 11:00 AM, a Chiang Kai-shek aircraft flew from the south, passed over our city heading north, and circled and strafed locations including Shigejie, Gaojiazhuang, and Anyang Village in Lucheng. A girl of just over ten years old in Anyang Village was killed on the spot. Countless civilian houses were also shot through in Shigejie. The military and civilians here are extremely resentful of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft harassing and attacking peaceful villages.

　　蒋机暴行
    扫射我潞城村庄
    【本报长治二十六日电】昨日（二十五）上午十一时，蒋机一架由南飞来，经本市上空北飞，在潞城石圪节、高家庄、安阳村等地盘旋扫射，安阳村一十余岁女孩当被击毙；石圪节民房亦被射穿无数。此间军民对蒋机袭扰和平农村的暴行均极痛恨。
