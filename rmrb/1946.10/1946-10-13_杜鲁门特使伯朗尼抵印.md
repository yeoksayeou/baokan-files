　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: New Delhi dispatch: Amidst the turbulent situation in India, Truman's special envoy Brownell arrived in the Indian capital on the 7th. Mr. Brownell represents the U.S. government in negotiations with the Indian government on U.S.-India air traffic issues. That evening, he extensively exchanged opinions with the Indian government's Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and formal negotiations will begin soon. On the eve of Mr. Brownell's arrival in India (the 6th), Nehru gave a talk to the Associated Press, demanding that British troops immediately withdraw from India. He said, "Some say it is wrong for the new government to use British troops to suppress domestic riots. Demanding the withdrawal of British troops from India is a consistent policy of the Congress Party. Now is the time for British troops to withdraw from India." On the 7th, Gandhi called for unity between the Congress and Muslim League parties. Gandhi hopes that this unity will be more consolidated and lasting. That evening, Jinnah and Nehru held an eighty-minute meeting. Agence France-Presse reported that the leaders of the two parties will issue a joint statement on the 8th or 9th, and the Muslim League will participate in Nehru's government.
