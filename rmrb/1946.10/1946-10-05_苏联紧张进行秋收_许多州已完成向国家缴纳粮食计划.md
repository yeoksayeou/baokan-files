    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Union is rapidly carrying out the autumn harvest. Up to now, 62 million hectares (1 hectare equals 16 mu) of grain have been harvested. In many states in the South and East, the task of delivering grain to the state has been completed. Two-thirds of the crops in Siberia have been harvested, and many states there have had bumper harvests. More than 90 percent of the harvest has been completed in the Baltic republics. Central Asia is harvesting rice, and Moldavia is harvesting soybeans.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] Moscow dispatch: Newspapers published a letter from collective farmers in the Altai region to all collective farmers in the Soviet Union, stating: It is necessary to complete the annual plan for delivering grain to the state by October 30th, and deliver 6 million poods (1 pood equals 16.38 kilograms) of grain to the state beyond the plan. The letter also invited all Soviet farmers to deliver grain to the state early. The newspaper Izvestia commented on the letter, saying: "Once again, it shows the strength and vitality of the Soviet collective farm system and the patriotism of the Soviet farmers. This is a completely new peasantry."
