Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Shanghai News: Hu Ziying, a prominent industrialist and one of the leading figures in Shanghai's women's circles, published an article in a Shanghai newspaper on the 22nd of last month entitled "The World View of US Troops Withdrawing from China," pointing out that the "Withdraw from China Week" initiated by various democratic groups in the United States embodies the American people's opposition to the current foreign policy of the United States, and even includes the American people's opposition to the domestic policies of the United States. Hu stated: "US troops withdrawing from China" means that the United States should change its foreign policy. The United States should start with China in changing its foreign policy. This movement is of significance in establishing world peace. Hu criticized the US authorities' domestic and foreign policies as supporting big capitalists, causing isolationists to raise their heads, forming an oligarchy that oppresses laborers and reduces wages. As a result, it will inevitably be the same situation as after the First World War, with overproduction on one hand and increased unemployment on the other. This will not only lead to economic panic but will also trigger social revolution. Internationally, it is anti-Soviet and will inevitably support all anti-Soviet forces. We can see that after this war, all those who are anti-Soviet are backward, reactionary, and oppressive to the people. This result not only reverses human progress but also supports a few reactionary figures while offending the majority of people in various countries. Offending the majority of people will never have good results. Hitler has already given us a lesson from the past.

　　胡子婴氏著文评论称：
    美对华政策应改弦易辙得罪中国人民无好结果
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：此间妇女界领袖之一著名实业家胡子婴女士，于上月二十二日在沪报发表：“美军退出中国周的世界观”一文，指出美国各民主团体发起的“退出中国周”，其意义包括美国人民反对美国现行的外交政策，甚至也包括美国人民反对美国的对内政策。胡氏称：“美军退出中国”，就是说美国应该改变外交政策。美国改变外交政策，应该先从中国开始，这一运动是具有建立世界和平的意义的。胡氏批评美当局的内政外交是扶植大资本家，使孤立派抬头，形成寡头压迫劳工，减低工资，结果也一定与第一次大战同样情形，一面是生产过剩，另一面是失业增加，这不仅是要发生经济恐慌，而且将引起社会革命。在国际上是反苏，必然扶植一切反苏的力量，我们看一看这次战后凡是反苏的都是落后的，都是反动的，而且都是压迫人民的。这结果不仅是使人类开倒车，而且扶植少数反动人物，却得罪了大多数各国的人民。得罪了大多数人，决没有好结果，希特勒已经给我们有前车之鉴。
