　　Our Army Achieves Another Victory on the Pinghan Railway
	Liberation of Xinle Station, Destruction of Shahe Railway Bridge

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 17th] Today, the Eighth Route Army on the Pinghan Front, with swift action, liberated Xinle Station, Dongguan in Xinle City, and Wangjiafen and Zhaixidian strongholds north of the city in one fell swoop. The Shahe Railway Bridge in the southern suburbs of Xinle City has been completely destroyed. The Eighth Route Army also destroyed one armored vehicle and one military vehicle of the Chiang army north of Xinle, capturing more than 20 people and guns. The Pinghan Railway between Zhengding and Xinle has been cut off, and Xinle City is now surrounded by the Eighth Route Army. This is a new victory for the Eighth Route Army on this line after liberating more than a dozen towns and stations, including Dingxing, Wangdu, Xushui, and Rongcheng, and controlling more than 250 li of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway earlier this month.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th] The Eighth Route Army's self-defense counterattacks on various lines in Central Hebei have been repeatedly victorious. On the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, a unit of the Eighth Route Army liberated strongholds such as Pannan Guan, south of Qingxian, on the evening of the 4th, annihilating more than 70 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. It also overturned an armored vehicle in Jinghai, killing 50 Chiang army soldiers who came to the rescue, harvesting more than 10,000 catties of electric wire, and destroying a railway bridge. From the 8th to the 11th, 39 Chiang Kai-shek puppet bunkers between Xincheng and Zhuoxian, east of the Pinghan Railway, have been completely cleared by local soldiers and civilians, with a portion of the Chiang army annihilated and a portion fleeing. Simultaneously with the recovery of Zhaoxian on the southern front of Central Hebei, six strongholds, including Gucheng and Dashiqiao, south of Zhaoxian City, were successively recovered.
