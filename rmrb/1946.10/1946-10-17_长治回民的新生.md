　　The Rebirth of the Hui People of Changzhi

　　The Hui people – in many people's minds, a mystery. How do they live? What is their ideological state? Can they be mobilized like the Han people? The work with the Hui people in Changzhi City answers these questions.

　　There are 689 Hui households in Changzhi city, totaling 3,343 people. Their main occupation is the handicraft industry of fur processing, with a very small number being workshop owners, and the majority being workers and urban poor. Before the War of Resistance, there were 36 fur workshops and three large fur trading houses here, employing up to 1,400 workers at its peak.

　　The life of fur workers was very hard. The most strenuous fur beating workers earned only twelve cents a day, and fur tailors, the skilled workers in the fur industry, earned no more than forty-five cents for tailoring a fur coat. However, the workers could not get all of this money. They were extremely poor, with an average of less than half an acre of land per person. Every year around February and March, they were all in trouble and had to draw wages in advance from the workshops, which would invariably give them less.

　　Workers and the poor sometimes tanned thirty or forty pieces of leather and sewed a few fur coats themselves. They were unable to transport and sell them in Hankou and Tianjin, and could only hand them over to large fur trading houses, forcing them to endure heavy intermediate exploitation.

　　This very sharp class opposition was concealed by the Hui rulers in many ways. The Hui people are a religiously oriented ethnic group, and everything is permeated with religious color. The Hui people have a deep-rooted belief in fate and rely on Allah. The "Ahong" enjoys the greatest faith and authority. The mosque is a huge organization that leases land and houses (collecting high rents and usury) and receives "Zakat" from the Hui people (nominally alms, but actually a tax). The "Ahong" and the heads of the community control the mosque.

　　Under the oppression of the Kuomintang's (and past rulers') Han chauvinism, there were contradictions between the Hui and Han people. And the Hui people are a minority, which formed a certain degree of solidarity within the Hui community to resist the Han oppressors, and the Hui rulers tried to expand this contradiction to facilitate their rule. In fact, the big workshop owners were the direct oppressors of the poor Hui people. Ma Lihu was the young owner of the Tongshunyi workshop and the "Ahong" of the mosque. His fifth uncle, Ma Zijie, was a major plainclothes agent during the enemy and puppet regime.

　　After the enemy occupied Changzhi, they immediately established fur combinations and livestock communes to control the entire fur industry. Plainclothes agents often visited homes, and anyone who made fur goods or spun wool was not only confiscated but also heavily fined. The Hui people have a saying: "One can abandon one's parents, but not one's smelly fur trade." The fur industry was strangled, and most Hui people lost their jobs. The young and middle-aged became coolies, and the old and weak begged on the streets, presenting a miserable scene.

　　The dregs of the Hui people – Hui traitors – made a fortune at this time. Ma Guozhen became the chairman of the "Hui People's Branch," and Zhu Sanyuan became the head of the "Livestock Commune." They forced each Hui family to pay two yuan to establish the "Hui People's Cooperative," controlling oil, salt, and cloth. Poor shareholders could not buy anything with the money, but they took away bolts of cloth and bags of salt at will. During the famine years, the mosque held large piles of stored grain, but the poor could not buy it with money, while they transported it home bag after bag.

　　The Eighth Route Army liberated Changzhi city. At first, the Hui people did not understand the policies of the democratic government, and special agents spread rumors, so they dared not approach the working staff or even receive relief grain. When the relief grain was distributed, those who did not receive the grain felt cheated, and seeing the gentle attitude of the working staff, they slowly moved from fear to approach. The victory celebration was a great encouragement to them. They saw with their own eyes the sincere love of the people in the liberated areas for the Eighth Route Army, and they believed in the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government even more.

　　Last December, the anti-traitor liquidation movement was vigorously launched, and the Hui people were also encouraged to launch a movement to air their grievances, exposing the crimes of the Hui traitor Ma Guozhen. Ma was arrested by the government on charges of being a traitor. However, the mass movement was quickly sabotaged by the feudal forces among the Hui people. The bullies used the mosque to intensify prayers and used the position of the "Ahong" to promote to the Hui people that: "We are an Islamic nation. There are no traitors among the Hui people. Ma Guozhen is a talented person among the Hui people." They put forward "Hui people do not eat Hui people," and forbade competition. The flame of revenge of the Hui people was suppressed, and the "community heads" went door-to-door asking people to put their fingerprints to bail out Ma Guozhen.

　　Most of the Hui people did not dare to speak, but a few activists were brewing. They adopted individual conversations and small-scale talks among three or five people to continue educating and enlightening the masses. In the talks, some people said, "Ma Guozhen is working for the benefit of the Hui people," others said, "Ma Guozhen is a traitor," and still others dared not express their opinions. The leadership immediately asked: For whom is Ma Guozhen working? What kind of person is he who works for the Japanese devils? They mobilized everyone to discuss, and the deceived masses finally woke up. Even little Ma said: "My father died without cloth to wrap him (Hui custom is to wrap the dead in white cloth), but Ma Guozhen was able to embezzle a lot of foreign cloth from the cooperative. Who did he do good deeds for?" Ma Nianze said: "Ma Guozhen ran the cooperative for the Japanese devils, cheated many poor people. The year before last, I was so hungry that I had no choice but to jump into a well, and after I was pulled out, Ma Guozhen still forced me to collect things for the Japanese. Who says he is not a traitor?" Many people said, "He is not a traitor, he is a Hui traitor!" After more than twenty days of brewing and colluding, the conspiracy of the feudal forces was shattered. The Hui people reorganized and shouted the slogan: "Poor people all over the world are one family. Ma Guozhen ate the flesh of our poor Hui people. Ma Guozhen is a traitor and must be liquidated." Then a vigorous liquidation action was launched.

　　As the movement deepened, the problems of many Hui bullies who were hiding in the mosque and occupying the positions of "Ahong" and "community heads" were also raised. Hui activists said: Our demand for rent reduction and debt liquidation is not to fight our own mosque, but to oppose feudal exploitation and to oppose the bullies and landlords who use the temple to rule and oppress us. The Communist Party is helping our poor Hui people to turn over, and does not oppose our religion. The vast majority sympathize with this proposition, and boldly lease, clear debts and increase wages to those bullies and landlords who are occupying the positions of "Ahong" and "community heads."

　　The liquidation was victorious. The Hui people were freed from feudal oppression and exploitation. They elected a community property management committee in a democratic way to manage the public property of the mosque, and abolished the old "community heads." As for the "Ahong," everyone decided that he could only manage religious affairs and could not rule everything.

　　The poor Hui people have gained many fruits and have truly turned over. They have recovered a lot of extorted money, and the poorest families can get more than 60,000 yuan each. They used this money to establish twelve large cooperatives, including more than 1,400 members, with a share capital of more than 3.6 million yuan, to restore the fur business. They also organized 135 small cooperatives, including 577 members, with a share capital of more than 4.7 million yuan, to operate in the sale of calico, oil, salt, and other items to supply the daily necessities of the Hui people. The "water house" (bathhouse) equipment of the mosque is now not only the patent of the rich and powerful Hui people, but a right that all Hui people can enjoy. The life of the Hui people who have turned over has been improved. They are happy and go to the mosque to do their prayers on time. In the prayers, many of the newly turned-over Hui people have added a new item, that is, to bless Chairman Mao!

　　长治回民的新生
    回民——在许多人的头脑中是一个谜。他们在怎么样生活？他们的思想状况如何？他们能够像汉民一样的发动起来吗？长治市的回民工作解答了这些问题。
    长治城里的回民有六百八十九户，三千三百四十三人。他们主要的职业是经营手工业性质的皮毛业，其中有极少数是作坊主，大部分是工人和城市贫民。抗战以前这里有三十六座皮毛作坊和三个大皮行，最多时曾雇用一千四百个工人。
    皮毛工人的生活是很苦的。最出力的打皮工人每天工资只一毛二，裁皮工人是皮毛业中的技术人才，裁一件皮袄也不过四毛五。但是，工人们并不能完全拿到这些钱。他们极穷，每人平均不到半亩地，每到二三月间就都困起来了，只得向作坊里预支工资，作坊里照例要少给些。
    工人们、贫民们有时自己也熟三二十张皮子，缝几身皮袄。他们自己无力运到汉（口）津（天津）等地去卖，只能交给大皮毛行，他们不得不忍受一重荷重的中间剥削。
    这种非常尖锐的阶级对立，被回族中的统治者用许多方法掩盖起来。回族是个宗教化了的民族，一切都侵润在宗教的色彩里。回民根深蒂固的相信命运，依赖真主，“阿訇”享有了最大的信仰和权威。清真寺是个庞大的组织，出租土地房屋（收高租重利），收受回民的“天课”（名为布施，实系征收）。“阿訇”和社头，统治着清真寺。
    在国民党（和过去历代的统治者）大汉族主义的压迫下，回汉两族是有矛盾的。而回族又是个少数民族，这就形成回胞内部某种程度的团结，以对抗汉族的压迫者，回族的统治者也就尽量扩大这种矛盾以利其统治。其实，大作坊主才是贫苦回胞的直接压迫者，马李虎是同顺义大作坊的少东，又是清真寺的“阿訇”，他五叔马子杰是敌伪统治时的大便衣。
    敌人侵占长治后，立即成立皮毛组合和畜产公社，统制了整个的皮毛业。便衣们常到各家访问，谁家作了皮货，谁家纺了毛线，不但没收，还得重罚。回民有谚：“能舍亲爹娘，不舍臭皮行”，皮毛业被绞杀，大部回民都失业了。青壮流为苦力，老弱沿街求乞，一片凄惨的景象。
    回民中的败类——回奸却在这时候发了财。马国真当了“回民分会”会长，朱三元当了“畜产公社”社长。他们强迫每家回民出两元钱成立“回民合作社”，统制油盐布匹，贫苦股东拿了钱买不出东西，他们却随便拿走成匹的布，成袋的盐。在灾荒年间，清真寺里放着大堆存谷，穷人花钱买不出，他们却一袋一袋的往家里运。
    八路军解放了长治城。回民起初不了解民主政府的政策，特务分子又从中造谣，他们不敢接近工作人员，甚至不敢领救济粮食。救济粮发下来了，没有领粮的人觉得上了当，又看到工作人员态度温和，慢慢的由恐惧而接近。祝捷大会对他们是个很大的鼓励，他们亲眼看到解放区人民对八路军的真诚热爱，更加相信八路军和民主政府了。
    去年十二月反奸清算运动猛烈开展，回民也被鼓舞起来，展开了诉苦运动，提出了回奸马国真的罪恶。马以汉奸罪被政府逮捕了。但是群众运动很快遭到回民中封建势力的破坏，恶霸们利用清真寺，加紧了礼拜，利用“阿訇”的地位向回民宣扬说：我们是伊斯兰民族，回民里没有汉奸，马国真是回民的人才。提出“回民不吃回民肉的”，不准竞争。回民复仇的火焰被压下去了，“社头”们挨户叫人们打手印保释马国真。
    大部回民不敢说话了，少数积极分子们却在酝酿，他们采取个别谈话、三五人的小型漫谈的方式，来继续教育启发群众。在漫谈中，有人说：“马国真是为回民大家办事”，有人说：“马国真是汉奸”，还有人不敢提意见。领导上当即提出：马国真到底为谁办事？替日寇办事的算什人？发动大家讨论，被蒙蔽的群众终于清醒了。马小孩都说：“我父亲死了没布包（回民风俗死人是用白布包的），马国真却能贪污合作社许多洋布，他给那个人办过的好事”！马年则说：“马国真替日本鬼办合作社，坑了多少穷人，前年我饿的没办法跳了井，被人捞起来，马国真还是逼着为日本要征集的东西，谁说他不是汉奸？”许多人都说：“他不是汉奸，是回奸！”经过二十多天的酝酿串通，封建势力的阴谋粉碎了，回民们又重新组织起来，喊出了：“天下穷人是一家，马国真吃了咱们穷回民的肉，马国真是汉奸，一定要清算”的口号。接着就开展了轰轰烈烈的清算行动。
    在运动深入的时候，许多隐藏在清真寺窃踞“阿訇”、“社头”等地位的回民恶霸们的问题也提出来了，回民积极分子说：我们要求减租清债不是斗争咱们自己的清真寺，是反对封建剥削，反对利用寺来统治压迫我们的恶霸地主，共产党是帮助咱穷回民翻身，不反对咱们的教，绝大多数同情这个主张，大胆向那些窃踞“阿訇”、“社头”的恶霸地主们出租、清债和增资。
    清算胜利了，回民摆脱了封建的压迫与剥削，他们以民主方式选举了社产管理委员会来管理清真寺的公产，取消了旧“社头”；对于“阿訇”，大家决定他只能管教里的事，不能统治一切。
    贫苦回民获得了许多果实，真正是翻身了，收回许多被讹诈的钱，最贫苦的每家可分得六万余元，他们用这笔钱成立了十二个大合作社，包括社员一千四百余人，股金三百六十余万元，来恢复了皮毛业的经营，还组织了一百三十五个小型合作社，包括社员五百七十七人，股金四百七十余万元，经营花布、油盐等买卖，来供应回民的生活必需品。清真寺的“水房”（洗澡塘）设备，现在不只是那些有钱有势的回民的专利，而是全体回民都能享受的权利了。翻身回民的生活改善了，他们高高兴兴的，按时到清真寺做他们的礼拜。在礼拜中，许多新翻身的回民，并且增加了一项新内容，那就是为毛主席祝福！
