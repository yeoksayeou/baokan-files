　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Children's Corps Works Diligently
    Actively Solve Difficulties for Military Families
    [Report from this newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan] The Children's Corps and Sisters' Corps of Dayue Village, Seventh District, Qingfeng, responded to the call of "Take more care of military families" and actively helped military families with their work. After more than one hundred and twenty sisters and children in the entire village marched in rows singing songs to the fields after those participating in the war and joining the army left, they bundled all six and a half mu of wheat straw belonging to military families and delivered it to their homes. While carrying it, they started a competition. Children as young as eight or nine years old carried the wheat straw with difficulty; children as young as six or seven years old, unable to carry it alone, tried to lift it together. Some fell down, but quickly got up; some were covered in sweat from exhaustion. When the military families saw this situation, they were moved and said in unison, "Children! Take a rest! You have also worked hard to defeat Old Chiang!"
    Since forty-two young adults from Xiqingcheng Village, Ninth District, Changyuan, left for the front lines, Wang Huapu and Zhang Qinghe, the heads of the Children's Corps, called on the entire Children's Corps to help the families of militiamen participating in the war to solve the problem of obtaining water. Their eighteen children were divided into two groups. The stronger ones carried, and the younger ones lifted. They held review meetings every night to reward activists. Everyone worked harder and harder. Everyone said, "In order to defeat Old Chiang, we should help military families solve their difficulties."
    The Children's Corps of the Tenth District of Juancheng was divided into groups to carry water and cut grass for families of those on duty and military families, and diligently stood guard and patrolled during the day, checking pedestrians. At the meeting of the Children's Corps members, more than one hundred and sixty children unanimously said, "Everyone has a share in defeating Old Chiang. Although we are young, we can also do a good job in the rear."

　　冀鲁豫儿童团勤奋工作
    积极为军属解决困难
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】清丰七区大岳庄的儿童团和姐妹团，响应了“多多照顾军属”的号召，积极帮助军属干活。全村一百二十多个姐妹儿童们，于参战参军的人走后，即排着队唱着歌到地里去，将军属的六亩半麦秸，都捆好送到军属家里。他们一面扛，一面发起比赛，八九岁的孩子也扛着麦楷，吃力的走着；六七岁的小孩，一人扛不动，就想办法两个人抬。有的跌倒了，很快就爬起来；有的累的满头大汗。军属们看到这种情形，都感动的齐声说：“孩子们！快歇歇吧！你们为了打败老蒋，也辛苦啦！”
    长垣九区西清城村自从四十二名青壮年出发前线后，儿童团长王华普、张青河两人即号召儿童团全体帮助参战民兵家属解决吃水问题。他们十八个儿童分为两组，力气大的担，年纪小的抬，每天晚上开检讨会，奖励积极分子。每个人的工作都越干越有劲。大家都说：“为了打败老蒋，就该帮助军属们解决困难。”
    鄄城十区的儿童团分组为出差家属及军属担水、割草，白天则认真站岗放哨，盘查行人。他们在儿童团员的会议上，一百六十多个儿童一致说：“打老蒋人人有份，我们年纪虽小，也能做好后方工作。”
