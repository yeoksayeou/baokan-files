Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Beijing Report: All circles in Beijing and Tianjin are protesting the tragic death of lawyer Wang Zhenhua, who was killed by an American military vehicle. The Beijing Lawyers Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 15th, resolving to lodge a serious protest with the American military authorities, demanding compensation for losses and the handover of the culprit to the Chinese court for punishment. It also called on local lawyers associations to provide support. On the same day, the Chaoyang University Alumni Association also held a meeting, resolving to submit a protest letter signed by more than 1,700 people to the American military headquarters and Stuart, demanding punishment and compensation, and guaranteeing that similar incidents would not happen again. At the same time, it was decided to hold a memorial service, requesting the authorities to investigate the judgment process of previous American military vehicle accidents in Tianjin and Beijing and the status of unadjudicated cases. It is reported that Liu Pengying, the chairman of the Tianjin Lawyers Association, stated that Tianjin also decided to hold a meeting to protest this American atrocity. However, the Kuomintang authorities tried their best to defend their "foreign fathers." The Central News Agency publicly declared on the 17th that "Lawyer Wang died because his bicycle crashed into the side of the truck," and that the American military "should not be held responsible."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: American military vehicle killings in Tianjin, Qingdao and other places continue to occur; on the afternoon of the 11th, a Tianjin US Marine Corps vehicle ran over and killed two women picking up wood chips on the roadside behind the Machang Automobile Transportation Yard. On the 14th, a vehicle driven by a US Navy driver hit Cui, a driver of the Jiang army's rear service supply unit in Tianjin, near the garrison, and the car ran over him, crushing his head to death. While the bloodstains of lawyer Wang Zhenhua in Beiping were still fresh, on the 12th, an American military truck No. 640 hit and injured Yu Deshui, a private under the supervision of the Kuomintang Ministry of Military Administration, at the Dingzi Street of Xisi Archway, endangering his life. The American driver was Dalwalkan. On the same day, at the south entrance of Xishiku on Xi'anmen Street, a child was also injured in the leg by an American military truck. On the 13th, Wang Junliang, a driver of a certain military motorcycle, was hit by a speeding American jeep when he drove to the east entrance of Fangsheng Hutong, breaking Wang's left leg. On the 3rd, an American military jeep in Qingdao, while passing the refugee shelter in Dongzhou Road, deliberately threw three explosive thunder tubes and sped away. They were picked up by a ten-year-old child beside the road, and they exploded immediately, tearing his chest and abdomen and killing him.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Shanghai report: American military atrocities in Shanghai are escalating. At about 10 pm on September 30, an American sailor engaged in obscene sexual behavior with a haggard-looking woman in front of the No. 169 Yuanmingyuan Road building. Passers-by stepped forward to intervene and were beaten. On the same day, an American sailor hired a pedicab from Jing'an Temple to a nightclub in front of the Sacred Heart Church, but refused to pay the fare. The pedicab driver, Huang Jinzhi, stepped forward to demand payment and was dragged into the nightclub and beaten by the patrolling American military police. On the same day, American soldiers Motes and another American sailor drove a ten-wheeled truck to a certain hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to find women, and crashed into the hotel's front wall and iron gate. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the two American soldiers accelerated and fled, injuring a pedicab driver parked at the entrance of the alley. On October 5, two American soldiers fired three shots on Wufang Road, threatening pedicab driver Hao Guangyu. On October 6, three American soldiers broke into the home of a young woman at No. 43 Changyang Road. The young woman fled out the door and into the Shenpei Middle School next door. The three American soldiers tracked her down and smashed the school's screen. The school teacher came forward to dissuade them and was almost beaten.
