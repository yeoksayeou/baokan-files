[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Bureau dispatch on the 29th] Juancheng Maqiao Village and Qibin Wangjiazhai, in this patriotic self-defense war, solved the contradiction between war and production through mutual aid of labor. In Juancheng Maqiao Village, two-thirds of the young and middle-aged people have gone to the front line to provide support. At first, the villagers felt that doing work was a big problem, and there was a need to organize mutual aid groups. Village cadres, according to the demands of the masses, convened a mass meeting to discuss mutual aid methods. It was immediately decided that all the strong, old, and young people in the village would be combined into one large brigade. It was also stipulated that the mutual aid method would be that whoever's crops ripened early would have their work done first (each eats their own). At the same time, regardless of wealth or poverty, each mu would hand over thirteen catties of grain, to be divided publicly by the mutual aid team members. After this method was implemented, it was supported by the entire village, and everyone was willing to continue mutual aid for a long time. The mutual aid work of Wang Yinting's group in Wangjiazhai, Qibin County, was done best. He can scientifically divide labor according to each person's strengths to give play to everyone's enthusiasm. During the slack farming season, they trafficked tung oil and opened a grocery store, earning a total of 250,000 yuan from March to now. They regularly hold meetings to review their work, and everyone is very enthusiastic about working. When they went to the front line this time, it was the time to cut sorghum. Eight of the nine laborers in Wang Yinting's group left, leaving one person to lead nine semi-laborers, who cut twenty mu of sorghum in three days. Later, the team members returned from the front line and happily said, "If it weren't for the mutual aid group, the sorghum would still be in the ground!" Everyone unanimously felt that "Organizing a mutual aid group is good and can solve all difficulties."

　　鄄城马桥村齐滨王家寨
    积极组织互助大队  青壮参战不误秋收
    【本报冀鲁豫廿九日电】鄄城马桥村和齐滨王家寨在这次爱国自卫战争中，以劳力互助的办法，解决了战争生产的矛盾。鄄城马桥村三分之二的青壮年都出差支援前线了，全村群众最初都感到做活很成问题，有组织互助组的必要。村干部根据群众的要求，召开了群众大会，讨论互助办法。当即决定全村的壮年老年少年都结合起来，编为一大队。并规定互助办法是，谁的庄稼熟的早，就先做谁的活（自吃自的）。同时不论贫富，每亩交出十三斤粮，由互助组员公分。这办法实行后，得到全村群众拥护，都愿意长期互助下去。齐滨县王家寨王银亭组的互助工作作得最好。他能根据每个人的特长科学分工，以发挥每个人的积极性。在农闲时，贩桐油、开杂货铺，从三月到现在共赚二十五万元。他们经常开会检讨大家干活都很起劲。这次出差支援前线时，正是砍高粱的时候，王银亭组的九个劳动力走了八个，剩下一个人领导九个半劳动力，在三天内砍了二十亩高粱。后来组员们从前线归来，很高兴的说：“要不是互助组，高粱还在地里呢！”大家一致感到“组织互助组好，能解决一切困难。”
