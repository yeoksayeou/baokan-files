　　Chiang Kai-shek Puts All His Efforts into Attacking

　　Civil War Has Reached an Unprecedented Scale

【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th】A Xinhua News Agency military reporter commented on the scale and situation of the current Chinese civil war, stating: The Chinese civil war has reached an unprecedented scale, not only unparalleled in Chinese history but also unmatched by any domestic war in the annals of world history. Chiang Kai-shek and his propaganda organs have recently been shouting about "suppressing bandits and rebels" and "eliminating" the CCP and any other groups or even individuals' "illegal" armed forces; at the same time, his Minister of Propaganda, Peng Xuepei, said to foreign reporters on the 25th: "The so-called all-out conflict is propaganda by the CCP. In reality, conflicts in places other than the Rehe area have almost ceased." These contradictory statements serve the same purpose: to conceal the truth about the civil war, boost the morale of the Chiang army, continue to expand the civil war, and ease the growing opposition from the American people and peace-loving people around the world to the US authorities' support for Chiang's civil war. We must inform people at home and abroad that the Chinese civil war has not "shrunk" but is expanding! The "peace talks" atmosphere spread by Nanjing is merely a smokescreen to cover up Chiang Kai-shek's adjustment of his forces and expansion of the civil war. Currently, in addition to occasional battles in the Northeast, the civil war has spread to eleven provinces within the customs: Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei (in the Chiang-controlled areas, Chiang Kai-shek is also carrying out "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against popular uprisings). In the north, the Chiang army is attacking Zhangjiakou, and the battles in the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area are in full swing. Recently, the Chiang army has also been making continuous probing attacks in the Northeast and is preparing to invade places like Harbin and Andong. In the south, after suffering heavy losses in central Jiangsu, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and southern Shanxi, the Chiang army is planning new offensives. Chiang Kai-shek is using 208 divisions of regular troops, totaling 1.74 million men, to attack the liberated areas, accounting for 85 percent of his total 256 divisions of regular troops, totaling 2.06 million men, not including puppet troops and local militias. The cost of the civil war is enormous. In the first five months of this year, financial expenditures were 250 trillion yuan, with military expenditures accounting for 74 percent. The civil war in June, July, and August was much larger than in the first half of the year, costing at least this amount. The requisition of 100 million dan of land tax in kind, the leasing of 1.5 billion US dollars worth of materials, and the remaining 82.5 million US dollars worth of materials are also largely or entirely used for the civil war. Recalling the civil wars since the founding of the Republic of China, the total number of troops mobilized by both sides in the wars between Chiang, Feng, and Yan was no more than 500,000. Chiang Kai-shek's five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Jiangxi Soviet area were the largest civil war at the time, and Chiang's army only used 800,000 troops. Compared with other countries in the world, the total number of troops on both sides in the Spanish Civil War was about 80,000, and the American Civil War involved no more than 1 million to 1.5 million people fighting. The civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek has truly broken historical records. In the recent three months of civil war, although the Chiang army has occupied some cities and places, it has lost 15 entire divisions (now renamed brigades), two transportation corps (equivalent to divisions in terms of organization), and another 33 entire regiments, 11 security regiments, 22 entire battalions, and 13 entire companies, totaling over 200,000 men. Some of these lost soldiers have been incorporated into the liberated areas' forces and turned their guns against Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. However, some have also become Chiang Kai-shek's meaningless sacrifices. Chiang Kai-shek's planned goal is to "eliminate the Communist Party within one year." His progress schedule is: to annihilate Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains within 48 hours by the end of June; to occupy the northern Jiangsu liberated area within two weeks by mid-July; to clear the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Jiaoji Railway within three weeks in August; to eliminate the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning and Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated areas in September;... None of the goals stipulated in these progress schedules have been achieved, nor will they ever be achieved. Although he has occupied some cities and strongholds at a great cost, it is difficult to connect them into "lines," let alone control the vast "areas." The military and civilians in the liberated areas, in order to protect the lives and property of the people in the liberated areas and to protect China's cause of peace and democracy, will resolutely carry out just self-defense. No matter how long the fighting lasts, no matter how much help American imperialism gives Chiang Kai-shek, they will continue to fight tirelessly until the goal of crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is achieved. It is impossible for Chiang Kai-shek to conceal the unprecedented scale, long-term trend, and the truth that the Chiang army is bound to fail in China's civil war from the Chinese and world people!

　　新华社记者论目前战局
    蒋介石倾全力进攻
    内战已达空前规模
    【新华社延安卅日电】新华社军事记者论目前中国内战的规模与形势称：中国内战已经达到了空前的规模，不仅为中国历史上所旷古未有，而且翻遍世界各国史册，也查不到任何一次国内战争堪与比拟。蒋介石及其宣传机关最近一面高叫“平剿匪乱”，“扑灭”中共及任何其他集团以至个人的一切“非法”武力；同时他的宣传部长彭学沛二十五日对外记者谈话则称：“所谓全面冲突，乃系中共之宣传，实际上除热河区域外，其他地方冲突几近中止。”这种自相矛盾的宣传，具有同一目的：即掩蔽内战真相，鼓励蒋军士气，继续扩大内战，而又和缓中美和世界爱好和平人民的日益高涨的反对美国当局援蒋内战的运动。我们应当告知中外人士，中国内战不仅没有“缩小”，而且正在扩大！南京方面所散布的“和平谈判”空气，仅仅是掩盖蒋介石调整兵力扩大内战的烟幕。现在内战，除东北时有战斗外，关内已蔓延到热河、察哈尔、绥远、陕西、河北、山西、山东、河南、江苏、安徽、湖北等十一个省份（在蒋管区内，蒋介石还向民变武装进行“围剿”）。北面蒋军正在进攻张家口，冀热辽地区的战事方兴未艾，最近蒋军又在东北不断作试探性进攻，并准备进犯哈尔滨、安东等地。南面蒋军在苏中、冀鲁豫、晋南连遭重创后，又在部署新的进攻。蒋介石用于进攻解放区的正规军达二百零八个师一百七十四万人，占其全部正规军二百五十六个师二百零六万人的百分之八十五，伪军和地方团队尚不计在内。内战经费浩大，今年头五个月财政开支二万五千万万元，军费占百分之七十四，六、七、八三个月内战比前半年大得多，至少也得此数。田赋征实一万万担，租借物资十五万万美金，剩余物资八万二千五百万美金，亦大部或全部用于内战。回忆民国以来的内战，蒋冯阎战争双方动用兵力合计不过五十万人，蒋介石对江西苏区的五次“围剿”是最大的一次内战，那时蒋军也只使用八十万；和世界其他国家比较，西班牙内战双方兵力合计约八万，美国的南北战争双方也不过一百几十万人在打。蒋介石所发动的这次内战，真打破了历史的纪录。在近三个月的内战中，蒋军虽侵占了若干城市和地方，但损失了十五个整师（现改称旅），两个交通纵队（等于师的编制），另三十三个整团。十一个保安团，二十二个整营，十三个整连，合计已突破二十万人的大关。这些损失的兵员有一部分补充了解放区的部队，掉转枪口反对蒋介石的内战。但也有一部分则作了蒋介石的无谓牺牲品。蒋介石的预定计划是“一年内消灭共产党”，他的进度表是：六月底四十八小时内歼灭中原李先念部；七月中两个星期内侵占苏北解放区；八月份三个星期内打通津浦路与胶济路；九月份消灭冀热辽和冀鲁豫解放区；…………。所有这些进程表上规定的目标，是没有一个完成的，亦将永远完成不了。他虽在付出重大代价后占领若干城市据点，但联成“线”都很困难，更无法控制广大的“面”。解放区军民为了保卫解放区人民的生命财产，为了保卫中国的和平民主事业，坚决进行正义的自卫，不管打得多久，不管美帝国主义给蒋介石多少帮助，将再接再厉的战斗下去，不达粉碎蒋介石进攻的目的决不中止。蒋介石要想对中国和世界人民隐蔽中国内战的空前规模、持久趋势与蒋军必败的真理，这是不可能的！
