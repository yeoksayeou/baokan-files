　　Xinhua News Agency, Jidong Front, 26th: The Beining Railway, a vital transportation artery connecting the Northeast and North China for the Chiang army's civil war, has been effectively sabotaged by the Jidong military and civilians in recent days. On the night of the 13th, 15 sections of railway tracks between Tangshan and Kaiping, Tanggu and Jinzhong, and Hangu were destroyed, and two railway bridges were also blown up. The militia recovered over 4,000 jin of electric wires along the way. The Chiang side forced civilians to repair day and night. By the evening of the 18th, one railway bridge between Tangshan and Kaiping was again destroyed by the local militia. Three sections of the roadbed near Changli were also cut off, and the road-breaking militia recovered another 12,000 jin of electric wires.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Jidong Front, 24th: After the Jidong Eighth Route Army won a victory in the counterattack in the Lu (Long) Luan (County) area, the Chiang army-occupied Qian'an County was isolated. The Chiang army specially dispatched the 13th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 94th Army stationed in Luan County, the 61st Regiment of the 21st Division stationed in Tong County, and the 424th Regiment stationed in Fengrun, a total of more than 3,000 people, who concentrated on the 17th in Yejituo, Jiajiaying, Yangguanying, Luanhe and other places more than 30 miles southwest of Qian'an, attempting to attack the local heroic self-defense military and civilians from inside and outside. Fierce fighting immediately broke out, and by the evening of the following day, the invading Chiang army had been defeated. It is estimated that more than 700 officers and soldiers including Ma Fengming, deputy regiment commander of the 61st Regiment, were killed or wounded, and a part of American equipment was seized. The remnants of the Chiang army are now constructing fortifications in villages such as Yejituo, waiting for reinforcements.
