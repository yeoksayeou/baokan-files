　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Nanjing dispatch: Staff within the Ministry of National Defense are brewing a strike due to unfair treatment. Since assuming office, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng has been doing his utmost to eliminate dissidents. He stipulated that managing general-level officers above the level of department, bureau, division, and office directors would receive special expenses and official residences in addition to their salaries. The special expenses alone amount to over 10 million yuan per person per month in some cases. General non-managing general-level officers receive no special expenses at all. The managing officers who enjoy these privileges are mostly direct subordinates of Chen Cheng. As for ordinary middle and lower-ranking officers, their treatment is even more meager. This has provoked fierce opposition from the majority, who are demanding the abolition of special expenses and all systems of private special reporting and special sales. They have also stated that if salaries are to be increased, everyone should receive an increase; otherwise, there should be no increase at all. The authorities have indicated that they may consider increasing salaries, but have refused to abolish special expenses, and the proposed salary increase is far from what everyone is demanding. As a result, more than 3,000 officers, both senior and junior, in the ministry began a full-scale work slowdown in the middle of last month, with official documents and telegrams piling up on their desks, and are brewing a major strike. Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi is standing by and watching the situation. When someone asked him to come forward to resolve the matter, he said: This kind of problem is managed by Chief of Staff Chen, and I am not clear about it. It is reported that Bai and Chen are engaged in fierce infighting due to their struggle for power and profit.

　　蒋政府国防部三千军官怠工
    【新华社延安十四日电】南京讯：国防部内工作人员因待遇不公，酝酿罢工。参谋总长陈诚自就任以来，竭力排除异己，规定厅、局、处、署、司长以上之主管将级军官，除薪水外，另发特支费及公馆。仅特支费一项，每人每月有高至一千万元以上者。一般非主管的将级军官，则概无特支费。而享有特权之主管军官，多系陈诚嫡系。至于一般中下级军官，待遇更极菲薄。因此引起大多数人猛烈反对，要求取消特支费及一切私人特报特销的制度，并表示如要加薪，大家都加，要不然一律不加，当局对此表示可酌量加薪，但拒绝取消特支费，而加薪标准又与大家所要求的相距甚远。因此该部大小军官三千余人，即于上月中旬开始全体怠工，公文电讯堆积案头，并酝酿大罢工。国防部长白崇禧对于此事袖手旁观，曾有人要他出面解决，他说：此种问题由陈参谋总长管，我不清楚。据悉白陈二人因争权夺利，暗斗甚烈。
