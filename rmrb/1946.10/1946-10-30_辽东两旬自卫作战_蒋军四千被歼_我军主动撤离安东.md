Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: The Liaodong Military Region recently announced the results of its battles against the Chiang army's offensive against the Liaodong Liberated Area in the past twenty-two days of this month. According to incomplete statistics, in more than thirty battles, large and small, over 4,300 Chiang army officers and soldiers, including regimental commanders and below, were killed or wounded. Eight heavy machine guns, sixty-one light machine guns, eighty submachine guns, fourteen 60mm mortars, over nine hundred and forty rifles, four hundred and forty 60mm mortar shells, over ninety thousand rounds of ammunition, and ten vehicles were captured. The captures by local armed forces are not included. In these twenty-two days, the Chiang army occupied the four empty cities of Liuhe, ×nan, Qingyuan, and Xinbin, averaging a loss of 1,075 men for each city occupied. When they used four divisions to open up the middle section of the Shenji Line, a stretch of over one hundred kilometers, in the first ten days of this month, they suffered over a thousand casualties. In the three days from the 20th to the 23rd, the Chiang army attempted to invade Tonghua but failed, losing 650 men. The Second Battalion of the 85th Regiment of the Chiang Army's 195th Division was largely wiped out, and another battalion was routed. The Chiang army stronghold in Wanzi, south of Qingyuan, has been recovered, and the Chiang army's highway transportation between Xinbin and Qingyuan has also been cut off.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th (Delayed): The Northeast Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from Andong City on the 24th. After all agencies had completed their planned withdrawal and evacuation beforehand, a large number of cadres transferred to the countryside to mobilize the masses and persist in a protracted struggle. Before the withdrawal, the Liaodong Military Region Headquarters and the Andong Provincial Government issued a statement and a proclamation, stating: The Chiang army has once again violated the truce agreement and, starting from the 20th, has launched an offensive into our Liaodong area with three divisions in three routes, attempting to seize Andong City. In order to ensure the preservation of our strength, avoid causing suffering to the residents, and create favorable conditions for annihilating the enemy, our army has decided to temporarily and voluntarily withdraw from Andong. The proclamation instructed all soldiers and civilians to unite closely, bravely resist, rely closely on the people and the rural democratic base areas, and that Andong City will ultimately return to the hands of the people.
