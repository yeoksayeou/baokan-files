　　Since Zhangbin Middle School implemented the new education policy, it has achieved significant results in learning, production, and other aspects. In order to further improve all aspects of work, the school has decided to hold an exhibition, a parents' meeting, and various competitions at the end of October, and to elect learning models and labor heroes. A mobilization meeting was held on the 14th of this month. After the meeting, enthusiastic competitions were launched between faculty and staff, between students, between groups, and between classes, launching a mass-based new heroism movement. The student union has also deployed this movement to the classes, and every cadre believes that a large number of activists will emerge in this competition. (Zhang Xun)

　　Since Taihang No. 8 Middle School was changed to "vocationalization," the school authorities have actively prepared and have now purchased five weaving machines, two sock knitting machines, and one spinning machine, and have established a chalk factory, a soap factory, and a small iron factory. It is guaranteed that two classes will learn two technologies in one month. Recently, in order to support the front lines, a "Supporting the Army Donation Team" was organized, raising a total of 51,734 yuan. On the day of the liberation of Jiaozuo, all the students organized a Yangko dance team and street costume propaganda, which was well received by the masses. (Sangqu Chun)

　　At the end of August, teacher-training students from Yubei Middle School participated in the turn-over team and went to various district villages in Lin County, Hui County, Wu'an, and Lucheng to help the masses thoroughly settle accounts and turn-over. Before their departure, they expressed that they would transform themselves in the mass movement, embody the new education policy of unity of teaching and application, and truly integrate learning with practice.
