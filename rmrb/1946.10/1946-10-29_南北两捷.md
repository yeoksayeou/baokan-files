The People's Liberation Army in Central China and the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region both achieved victories on the 24th in Lianshui and the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, respectively. These two battles eliminated 8,000 invading Chiang Kai-shek troops, making a new contribution to the people's patriotic self-defense war and greatly boosting the confidence of the liberated areas and the people across the country in victory. They also served as a direct and forceful response to Chiang Kai-shek's new military offensives, which were masked by a peace offensive in Nanjing.

After Chiang Kai-shek occupied Zhangjiakou and the two Huai areas, he became arrogant and self-important. Chiang Kai-shek's two divisions in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway moved south, and the Eleventh War Zone's First and Second Columns, defending Baoding, also moved north to meet them, fully expecting to open up the Pinghan Railway with minimal effort. However, the Eighth Route Army's attack on the Pinghan Railway was not focused on a single city or place but rather on seeking opportunities to kill the enemy's active forces. Therefore, after discerning Chiang Kai-shek's intentions, they strategically withdrew from some towns and stations north of Xushui and concentrated their forces on the 24th to completely wipe out more than 4,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops who had invaded from Baoding at Caohetou. In the Subei area, since the New Fourth Army withdrew from the two Huai areas a month ago, Chiang Kai-shek had been setting up a tight trap. The elite 74th Division (originally a military division), directly under Chiang Kai-shek's Army Headquarters in Nanjing, which had been rampaging in the Suwan border region west of the Grand Canal and east of the Jinpu Railway, finally suffered the righteous punishment of the People's Liberation Army during its invasion of the Lianshui area. Both armies were equipped with American weapons; all the weapons seized from the 8,000 annihilated troops were used to replenish the People's Liberation Army. This is another painful loss for Chiang Kai-shek, who is fixated on war.

The two victories in the north and south once again powerfully demonstrate that as long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's correct policy of annihilating the enemy's active forces, do not fixate on the gains and losses of a single city or place, and concentrate our forces flexibly, it is entirely possible to annihilate the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops once we have a favorable situation. Although the Chiang Kai-shek troops invading the liberated areas have become very careful and cautious after suffering huge losses of nearly 30 brigades in the past three months or so, they have adopted a method of advancing side by side, step by step, in the recent invasions of various liberated areas, with very small intervals between advances, and immediately building bunkers to fortify themselves each time they occupy a place. However, as long as our reconnaissance is accurate, our deployment is tight, our actions are swift, and our operations are flexible, we will always be able to find opportunities to severely strike the Chiang Kai-shek troops and annihilate their active forces, no matter the circumstances.

The news of the victories in both locations also demonstrates that the development of widespread mass guerrilla warfare in the liberated areas has greatly assisted the victory of large-scale mobile warfare by the main forces. It is no coincidence that these two annihilation battles occurred in the areas near Lianshui and Baoding, because these two areas have always been the most active arenas for guerrilla warfare. Taking Subei as an example, the Chiang Kai-shek troops, who are deeply isolated, have only occupied a few empty cities. Guerrillas and militiamen control the vast countryside, constantly threatening the towns occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Chiang Kai-shek has to deploy a lot of troops to defend these occupied empty cities, which greatly reduces his field army, and these field armies are constantly being consumed by our guerrilla warfare, creating favorable conditions for the main forces of the People's Liberation Army to defeat the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops one by one. Therefore, the deeper the Chiang Kai-shek troops penetrate into the liberated areas, the more isolated their position becomes, the longer their lines of communication become, the more difficult their supplies become, and the more dispersed their forces become, the greater the danger they face of being defeated and annihilated one by one. Chiang Kai-shek's troop deployment has reached saturation point, and there are no more troops to be transferred from the rear. Chiang Kai-shek's invading army is decreasing day by day, while the all-out resistance of the army and people in the liberated areas is becoming more and more vigorous. This is the basic trend in the development of the war situation.

After Chiang Kai-shek occupied the two Huai areas and Zhangjiakou, Chen Cheng, Peng Xuepei, and Chiang's propaganda organs said excitedly: "The Communist army has completely collapsed," "The Subei war is nearing its end," and "The military solution can be completed in three months, or at most five months." However, we have repeatedly warned Chiang Kai-shek and the likes of Chen Cheng that the all-out resistance of the army and people in the liberated areas is only just beginning. There is a long road ahead, and Chiang Kai-shek's suffering is just beginning. The victories near Lianshui and Baoding shattered their bombast and illusions just in time.

The army and people in the liberated areas are fighting for self-defense and justice and have won the support of compatriots from all walks of life across the country. We not only have the confidence but also the strength to uphold and implement the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to tear up the two major agreements with "accomplished facts" and force the people of the liberated areas to submit is absolutely impossible!

The army and people in the liberated areas yearn for peace; however, we know that there can only be peace if the ceasefire agreement and the PCC resolutions are implemented. The ceasefire agreement was solemnly signed by the Communist Party of China, the Kuomintang, and the United States, and the PCC resolutions were solemnly adopted unanimously by representatives of all parties and non-party figures. They are the result of the long years of struggle by the entire Chinese people and are sincerely supported by compatriots at home and abroad and by peace-loving and democratic people around the world. If these agreements can be wantonly discarded by American imperialist elements and Chiang Kai-shek under the pretext of "accomplished facts," then even if a hundred ceasefire orders are signed in the future, Chiang Kai-shek's civil war will only escalate. As long as Chiang Kai-shek's offensive does not stop for a day, and as long as Chiang Kai-shek's troops do not withdraw from the areas occupied after January 13, the army and people in the liberated areas can only resolutely defend themselves and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to the end to realize the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions that have been discarded by Chiang Kai-shek!

　　南北两捷
    解放日报
    华中与晋察冀人民解放军，同于二十四日在涟水与平汉北段获捷，两次战役共歼灭进犯蒋军八千人，对人民爱国自卫战争作了新的贡献，大大鼓舞了解放区和全国人民的胜利信心，也是给予南京和平攻势掩盖下的蒋介石新的军事进攻一个直接的有力答复。
    蒋介石在侵占张家口和两淮以后，趾高气扬，不可一世。平汉北段蒋介石两个师南下，防守保定的十一战区第一、二两纵队也北上接应，满以为不费吹灰之力即可打通平汉路。但八路军之出击平汉线着眼点，原不在一城一地，而在寻求机会杀伤蒋军有生力量。故在窥破蒋军企图后，遂机动撤离徐水以北若干城镇车站，于二十四日集中力量在漕河头全部歼灭了保定出犯的四千余蒋军。苏北方面，自新四军撤离两淮一个月以来，即为蒋军安排天罗地网。这支作为蒋介石陆军总部直属南京卫戍部队，曾经逞凶于运河以西津浦以东苏皖边境的精锐武装七十四师三个旅（原军师改），终于在进犯涟水地区中，遭受了人民解放军正义的惩罚。两军均美械装备；被歼八千人的武器，全部补充了人民解放军。这对一心好战的蒋介石，又是个痛心的损失。
    南北两捷再一次有力地证明：只要坚决执行毛主席、朱总司令歼灭蒋军有生力量的正确方针，不斤斤于一城一地的得失，机动地集中，一旦得到有利形势，歼灭进犯蒋军是完全可能的。虽然进犯解放区的蒋军在过去三个多月遭受将近三十个旅的巨大损失后，已经千小心万谨慎；在最近进犯各个解放区中，都采取齐头并进，步步为营办法，进军间隔甚小，每占一地立时筑碉自固。但是，只要我们侦察确实，部署严密，行动迅速，作战机动，无论在任何情况下，一定总能够找到严重打击蒋军、歼灭蒋军有生力量的机会。
    两地捷音也证明着：解放区广泛群众性游击战争的开展，大大地帮助了主力军大规模运动战的胜利。这两个歼灭战出现于涟水和保定附近地区，决不是偶然的；因为这两个地区向来是游击战最活跃的场合。以苏北来说，孤军深入的蒋军，只侵占了几座空城。游击队民兵控制了广大乡村，时刻威胁着蒋军侵占的城镇，蒋军不能不分出许多兵力去守备这些侵占的空城，这样就使得它的野战军大大减少，而且这些野战军还经常不断受到我游击战的消耗，给人民解放军主力部队造成了各个击破进犯蒋军的有利条件。所以，蒋军愈深入解放区，地位愈孤立，交通线愈长，补给愈困难，兵力也愈分散，野战力量便愈减弱，遭受各个击破与歼灭打击的危险便愈大。蒋介石兵力使用已达饱和点，后方再也无兵可调。蒋介石的进犯军天天减少，而解放区军民的全面抵抗却愈来愈有劲，这是战局发展的基本趋势。
    蒋军侵占两淮和张家口后，陈诚、彭学沛和蒋方宣传机关兴高彩烈地说：“共军已总崩溃”，“苏北战争已近尾声”，“可在三个月、至多五个月内完成以军事解决问题”。但是，我们曾经再警告蒋介石和陈诚之辈，目前解放区军民的全面抵抗仅仅只是开始，来日方长，蒋介石的苦难正多。涟水和保定附近之捷，恰如其时的粉碎了他们的大言和幻梦。
    解放区军民为自卫与正义而战，博得了全国各阶层同胞的拥护，我们不仅有信心，而且有力量维护和贯彻停战协定和政协决议。蒋介石企图以“既成事实”撕毁两大协定，强迫解放区人民俯首屈服，这是万万不行的！
    解放区军民是渴望和平的；但是，我们知道，只有贯彻停战协定和政协决议才有和平之可言。停战协定经过中共、国民党及美方三方面的庄严签字，政协会决议经过各党派及无党派人士代表一致庄严通过，为全中国人民多年奋斗的成果，为海内外同胞与世界和平民主人士所衷心拥护。如果这些协定可以放纵美帝国主义分子及蒋介石借口“既成事实”任意毁弃，那么，以后即使签订一百个停战令，蒋介石的内战就会愈打愈大。蒋介石的进攻一天不停止，蒋介石的军队一天不退出一月十三号后所侵占的地区，解放区军民只有坚决自卫下去，和全国人民一起，为实现已被蒋介石毁弃的停战令与政协决议而奋斗到底！
