Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 10th: Today, on Double Tenth Day, at 5 p.m., ten thousand people gathered at the South Gate Square to participate in the Yan'an All-Circles Rally to Respond to the Movement for US Troops to Withdraw from China and the Mobilization Conference to Defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Propaganda trucks moving around the city broadcast the glorious achievements of the liberated areas' people's self-defense war over the past few months. Yangko teams from various government agencies and schools performed skits depicting the atrocities of the US military in China. The Dongguan Elementary School Yangko team waved a paper mache figure of Chiang Kai-shek being led by his American master. Heroes of the 359th Brigade who broke through from the Central Plains, carrying American-style firearms, strode into the venue with vigor. People's Self-Defense Army soldiers poured in from all directions. The entire venue resounded with the song "March of the Volunteers." At the opening of the meeting, everyone stood at attention and silently paid respects to the national flag and Sun Yat-sen's portrait. Xie Juezai, Vice-Chairman of the Border Region Council, solemnly announced the significance of the meeting.

Vice Chairman Li of the Border Government Pointed Out
If the US Military Does Not Withdraw from China, We Must Treat Them as We Treated the Japanese寇 (Kou)
Li Dingming, Vice Chairman of the Border Government, spoke first: "Today, the national crisis caused by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and autocracy is even more serious than the Qing government's 'better to give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves'! American imperialism wants to turn China into its colony. We, the 450 million people, will never be slaves to a fallen nation. We must have the US military withdraw from China! Otherwise, we must treat them as we treated Japanese imperialism!" Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, condemned Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war policy and emphatically explained the Chinese people's confidence in victory (full text on another page of this issue). Mr. Guo Renzhi, Acting Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the People's Congress of the Liberated Areas of China, warned Chiang Kai-shek: "If the Kuomintang reactionaries insist on convening the 'National Assembly' on November 12 and passing a divisive, traitorous, and dictatorial constitution, then the people of the Liberated Areas will consider convening a People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas."

General Fan Longzhang Said
Fight to the End with the Warmongers!
General Fan Longzhang, Commander of the First Army of the Democratic National Construction Army, said: "During the Xinhai Revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the people to overthrow the Qing Dynasty; now we must oppose fascist dictatorship and drive out the American imperialist army. This hope is pinned on the leadership of the people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. General Gao Shuxun's Democratic National Construction Army stands on the side of the people, closely unites with the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all democratic armies, and cooperates with all anti-civil war armies. Anyone who launches an anti-people and anti-democratic war, we will fight them to the end!" Mr. Li Furén, President of Yan'an University, said: "The Chinese people are not to be trifled with; over the past hundred years, the Chinese people have defeated the joint attacks of imperialism and traitorous collaborators many times. We hope that American imperialist elements will open their eyes and take a look at the Chinese people. If it wants to follow the example of Japanese imperialism, then let it get out of China!" General Wang Zhen raised his arms and shouted: "Excellent sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, patriots, national heroes, we must crush the Jiang-American offensive, we are not afraid of death, we will carve out an independent, peaceful, democratic, and free new China from countless sacrifices!" Cui Tianfu, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions, called on workers throughout the border region to strive to increase production and support the front lines. Wang Kewen, Chairman of the Yan'an Chamber of Commerce, called on merchants in the border region not to buy or sell American goods and to develop self-sufficient industry and commerce.

Representative of Yan'an Self-Defense Army Calls Out
Shatter Complacency!
Next to speak was Zhang Dazhong, representative of the Yan'an Self-Defense Army, who automatically took the stage from the ranks. He waved his fist and said loudly: "The people of the border region must shatter complacency and resolutely defend the border region! Rural areas should produce more grain, factories should increase production, the army should increase military training, and the self-defense army should implement the integration of labor and military affairs. All the soldiers and civilians of the border region must unite and resolutely eliminate the Jiang troops attacking the border region!"

The conference passed four telegrams to American democratic groups, US President Truman, the United Nations Security Council, and Shanghai people's groups, accusing the US military's presence in China of endangering Far Eastern peace and demanding the withdrawal of US troops; and telegraphed a protest against the crime of US-made Chiang planes bombing Zhangjiakou. In the evening, the People's Theater Troupe performed "Defending Peace."

　　响应美军退出中国运动
    延安万人举行大会
    要求美军退出中国去要求蒋军退出侵占区
    【新华社延安十日电】今日为双十节，下午五时，万人汇集南关广场，参加延安各界响应美军退出中国运动暨保卫陕甘宁边区动员大会。流动于全市的宣传卡车，播出数月来解放区人民自卫战争的辉煌战绩。各机关学校的秧歌队表演美军在华暴行，东关完小秧歌队队前摇动着纸糊的蒋介石正被其美国主子牵引着的奴才相。中原突围的三五九旅英雄们，扛着美式枪械，矫健地步入会场。四面八方，涌进人民自卫军的铁流。全场上昂扬着“义勇军进行曲”的歌声。开会时，全体向国旗和孙中山先生遗像起立致敬默念。主席边区参议会副议长谢觉哉，郑重地宣布了开会的意义。
    边府李副主席指出
    如果美军不退出中国要以对日寇办法对它
    边府李副主席鼎铭首先讲话：“今天蒋介石卖国独裁专政所造成的民族危机，较之满清政府的‘宁赠友邦勿予家奴’更为严重！美帝国主义要把中国变成它的殖民地，我们四万万五千万人民决不当亡国奴，我们一定要美军退出中国！否则，我们要以对付日本帝国主义的办法来对付它们！”中共中央宣传部长陆定一指斥蒋介石卖国内战政策，并着重说明中国人民的胜利信心（全文见本版另文）。中国解放区人民代表大会筹委会代理秘书长郭任之先生警告蒋介石说：“如果国民党反动派一定坚持在十一月十二日召开‘国民大会’，通过分裂卖国独裁的宪法，那末解放区人民即将考虑召开解放区人民代表会议。”
    范龙章将军说
    和好战分子拼到底！
    民主建国军第一军军长范龙章将军说：“辛亥之役，孙中山先生领导人民推翻满清；现在我们要反对法西斯独裁，赶走美帝国主义军队。这个希望，就寄托在人民领袖毛主席和朱总司令的领导。高树勋将军率领的民主建国军，站在人民立场，与八路军新四军及一切民主军队亲密团结，和一切反内战的军队合作，任何人发动反人民反民主战争，我们就同他们拚到底！”延安大学校长李敷仁先生说：“中国人民是不好惹的；百年来，中国人民已经打败了多次帝国主义和卖国贼汉奸的联合进攻。我们希望美国帝国主义分子睁开眼睛来瞧瞧中国人民。如果它要学日本帝国主义的榜样，那么就让它从中国人民面前滚出去！”王震将军振臂高呼：“中华民族的优秀儿女、爱国主义者、民族英雄们、我们一定要粉碎蒋美进攻，我们不怕死，我们将从无数的牺牲中打出一个独立和平民主自由的新中国！”解放区职工委员会筹备会副主任崔田夫，号召全边区工人为提高生产支援前线而奋斗。延安市商会会长王克温，号召边区商人不买卖美货，发展自给自足的工商业。
    延市自卫军代表号召
    打破太平观念！
    接着讲话的是延市自卫军代表张大忠，他从行列里自动登台，他挥着拳头高声的说：“边区人民要打破太平观念，坚决保卫边区！农村多打粮食，工厂增加生产，军队多加练武，自卫军实行劳武结合。全边区军民团结起来，坚决消灭进攻边区的蒋军！”
    大会通过致美国各民主团体、美总统杜鲁门、联合国安全理事会及上海各人民团体通电四则，控诉美军驻华危及远东和平，要求美国撤兵；并通电抗议美制蒋机轰炸张垣的罪行。晚由民众剧团演出《保卫和平》。
