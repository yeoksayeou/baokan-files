Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Paris dispatch: The Peace Conference plenary session continued discussing the Hungarian treaty on the 12th, both morning and afternoon. The number of delegates present was quite sparse. All military and political clauses of the Hungarian treaty were passed by vote within 30 minutes. The South African [Note: South Africa was often abbreviated as "South" (南) during this period; this is likely a typo and should be "Yugoslavian" based on the context of the article] representative delivered a speech at the meeting, and the Yugoslav representative declared for the fourth time that Yugoslavia would not be bound by any decisions of the peace conference related to Yugoslavia. The Czech representative expressed regret that the treaty did not stipulate the repatriation of 200,000 Hungarians from Czech territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Paris dispatch: The Peace Conference plenary session, from 9:00 PM on the 10th to 2:00 AM on the 11th, already voted on the various clauses and annexes of the Romanian treaty. Among them, the US proposal regarding free navigation on the Danube and convening a conference of Britain, the US, France, the Soviet Union, and Danube riparian states within six months of the treaty's production to establish an international Danube management organization was actually passed, with the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Poland, and three other countries voting against it.
