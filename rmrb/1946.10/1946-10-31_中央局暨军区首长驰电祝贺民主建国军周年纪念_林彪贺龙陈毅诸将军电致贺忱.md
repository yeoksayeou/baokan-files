　　Central Bureau and Military Region Leaders Send Congratulatory Telegrams on the Anniversary of the Democratic National Construction Army
    Generals Lin Biao, He Long, Chen Yi Send Congratulatory Telegrams

    [This newspaper's special dispatch from the 29th] The leaders of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region have sent a telegram congratulating the anniversary of the Democratic National Construction Army. The congratulatory message states: Your path proves that the victory or defeat of war is not determined by superior weapons, but by the orientation of the people's hearts and the soldiers' hearts. You are the pioneers of uprising against the civil war. Those who follow in your footsteps will be even more numerous than now, until the victory of the patriotic self-defense war.
        Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Bo Yibo, Teng Daiyuan, Wang Hongkun, Zhang Jichun, and Wang Xinting respectfully congratulate.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th] Chen Yi, Su Yu, Tan Zhenlin, Zhong Qixian, Liu Guangsheng and other leaders of the East China Field Army, recently sent a telegram congratulating General Gao Shuxun, commander of the Democratic National Construction Army, on the anniversary of the Handan Uprising, and wished him continued efforts to jointly strive for China's independence, freedom, peace and democracy. At the same time, the Shandong Provincial Assembly, the Provincial Government, the CCP East China Bureau, and the New Fourth Army Headquarters and Shandong Military Region Headquarters, all sent congratulatory telegrams separately.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] The 30th of this month is the anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's glorious uprising for peace. General Lin Biao and the General Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army sent congratulatory telegrams:

    General Lin Biao's congratulatory telegram stated: Looking back on the past year, those who have followed in the footsteps of the General, resolutely breaking away from the civil war battlefield, include not only dissenting troops squeezed out by Chiang's army, but also Chiang's direct line troops. General Gao Shuxun's banner is a glorious banner on the civil war battlefield. I believe that the Kuomintang army, which is temporarily still on the civil war battlefield, will respond to the General's call more and more every day. On the occasion of the anniversary of General's glorious uprising, I am willing to lead all the soldiers of this army to fight side by side with General Gao and all the officers and soldiers of the Democratic National Construction Army to strive for the victory of the cause of peace and democracy!

    The congratulatory telegram from the General Headquarters and General Political Department of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army stated: Last year, when the flames of civil war spread throughout the heartland of the Jin-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, the General led his troops in the Handan Uprising, ceasing fighting and making peace with the Eighth Route Army, which had fought behind enemy lines and endured hardships. This year, the reactionaries' ferocity has soared, causing most of the country to fall into the destruction of artillery fire. The General has once again issued a circular denouncing the rebels, fighting to defend independence, democracy and peace. His great righteousness is admirable. On the occasion of the anniversary of the General's uprising, we are willing to stand with the 40 million compatriots in the entire Northeast on the front line against the civil war, as the General's backing, and jointly fight to meet and smash the reactionaries' offensive!

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 24th] The 30th of this month is the anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's uprising. General He Long, Commander of the Joint Defense Army of the five provinces of Jin-Sui-Shaan-Gan-Ning, sent a special telegram of congratulations yesterday.
