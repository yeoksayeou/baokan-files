Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 8th: The Eighth Route Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has routed Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth Division reinforcement troops. This division left Luanxian on the 5th, rushing to the Pinghan Line. On the 6th, two main regiments arrived at Songlin Village, south of Zhuoxian. On the 7th, as they advanced between Songlin Village and Gaobeidian, they were fiercely attacked by a unit of the Eighth Route Army, and the two main regiments of the division were completely defeated, with over 200 killed or wounded, and some captured. Today, the division has retreated north of Songlin Village and is holding its position.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th: The militia of Baoding County are now using the newly acquired weapons to equip several strong combat teams, coordinating with the main forces of the Eighth Route Army to participate in self-defense operations. For the past six months, the county's militia have stubbornly defended the entire northern riverbank area to thwart the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army's attacks and "cleansing" atrocities, and have frequently raided the flanks and rear of the Chiang Kai-shek army. The flames of guerrilla warfare have spread throughout the suburbs. According to statistics from the past seven months, they have engaged in 109 independent and coordinated self-defense operations with local military groups, captured five Chiang Kai-shek puppet strongholds, recovered more than 20 villages and towns that had been encroached upon, killed or wounded 1,355 Chiang Kai-shek puppet officers and soldiers, captured 167 alive, and seized 25 light and heavy machine guns, five grenade launchers, 256 rifles, seven pistols, and many other military supplies and looted materials. Note: Baoding is an important nest of internal warfare for the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Since the ceasefire agreement, under the personal leadership of warmongers Wang Fengcheng and major traitors Liu Huanan and Gao Delin, they have dispatched more than 42,000 troops to invade and harass the liberated areas 489 times in the past seven months, encroaching upon a total of 140 villages and towns. Two hundred and thirty-five cadres and civilians in the liberated areas have been arrested and killed, and more than 374,000 catties of grain and more than 500 carts of straw have been looted. They have also conscripted laborers in the occupied areas, forcibly occupying more than 18,000 mu of cultivated land and building more than 50 bunkers. Thousands of traitors and puppet police have been re-employed, and special agent organizations such as the so-called "Returning Home Teams" and "Fellow Villagers Associations" have been organized, and 25 large township offices from the enemy puppet rule have been restored to intensify their rule and extort the masses. According to statistics from Tang Village, a village of more than 300 households in the suburbs, an average of more than 50,000 catties of grain equivalent must be apportioned each month in land tax and cash. The masses, unable to bear the harsh exactions, have assisted the guerrillas and militia in various ways to carry out guerrilla warfare.

    【新华社张家口九日电】保定全县民兵现以所夺获的新式武器，装备了好几支强大的参战队，配合八路军主力，参加自卫作战。该县民兵半年来为粉碎蒋伪军进攻及“清乡”暴行，始终顽强扼守北部全线河沿岸地区，并不时袭入蒋军侧背，游击战争的火焰，燃遍城郊附近。据最近七个月来统计，单独与配合地方兵团自卫作战共一○九次，攻克蒋伪据点五处，恢复被蚕食村镇二十余处，毙伤蒋伪军官兵一千三百五十五名，生俘一百六十七名，缴获轻重机枪二十五挺，掷弹筒五个，步枪二百五十六支，手枪七支，及其他军用品被劫物资等甚多。按：保定为蒋伪军在平汉北段重要内战穴窠，自战停协定以来，在好战分子汪凤城及大汉奸刘化南高德林等亲自率领下，最近七个月来曾出动四万二千余兵力向解放区进犯骚扰，达四百八十九次，被其侵占的村镇共一百四十余个，解放区干部群众遭到捕杀者二百三十五人，抢粮三十七万四千余斤，谷草五百余车；并在侵陷地区滥征民工，强侵耕地一万八千余亩，构筑五十余座碉堡，数千名汉奸伪警等都被重新任用，组织有所谓“还乡队”“同乡会”等特务组织，并恢复敌伪统治时大乡公所二十五处，以加紧统治，勒索群众。据城郊三百余户人家的唐庄统计，每月平均即须摊派田赋现款等，合粮五万余斤。群众受不了苛扰，纷纷以各种方式协助游击队民兵等开展游击战争。
