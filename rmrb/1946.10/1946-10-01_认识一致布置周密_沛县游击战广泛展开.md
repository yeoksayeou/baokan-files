　　Consistent Understanding and Thorough Arrangements
    Guerrilla Warfare Widely Launched in Pei County

Since the stubborn troops occupied Pei County on the 22nd of last month, extensive guerrilla warfare has been launched throughout the county, thwarting the enemy's attempt to establish district and township administrations based on strongholds outside the city. Apart from occupying an isolated city, the stubborn troops have no foothold in the vast countryside. Illegal special agents and landlords of the "Returning Home Corps" dare not return home; enemy political workers are cooped up in the city, afraid to act rashly; while we maintain revolutionary order in the vast countryside. Why is the guerrilla movement in Pei County doing so well? The main reasons are as follows:

    (1) Timely and in-depth mobilization to grasp the thinking of cadres and establish the concept and confidence in launching guerrilla warfare against the stubborn enemy.

After the stubborn troops occupied Pei and Feng counties at the end of last month, many cadres and the masses lacked confidence in persisting in guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas. The county party committee promptly convened a general meeting of cadres from the whole region, combining the study of current affairs to correct the ideological biases of the cadres, and clarified that illegal landlords and ruffians were isolated minorities in the countryside. After resolving the land issue through mass movements, we have a considerable number of militia among the broad masses. The deeper the enemy penetrates into the liberated areas, the more dispersed their forces will be, and we have vast countryside to operate in; we have all the favorable conditions for carrying out guerrilla warfare. Furthermore, only by doing a good job in our guerrilla warfare, containing the enemy and cooperating with the main force in frontal operations, can we recover lost territory more quickly and win the victory of the self-defense war. In this way, the cadres established the concept and confidence in independently launching mass guerrilla warfare.

    (2) Establishing new organizational leadership adapted to the new environment.

When the stubborn troops initially occupied the county seat, the county committee called on the militia of the entire county to urgently mobilize, concentrating the militia by district to form a line of resistance against the stubborn troops in Pei County. However, because the organization was too large, it was inconvenient to manage, command, and operate, and it was also prone to chaos in the event of an enemy attack. Therefore, a streamlined reorganization was carried out. The county headquarters controlled a number of crack militia companies, cooperating with the county brigade as the backbone force for launching guerrilla warfare. Each district selected crack militia to form a small team, and district cadres were systematically incorporated into the companies. Each district headquarters controlled several small teams. In addition, excellent firearms and clever, brave, and skilled militia were selected to form small, lean, and efficient armed work teams to operate deep behind enemy lines or in urban areas. In the entire region, large armed forces supported small armed forces, launching extensive small-scale decentralized operations, achieving strikes everywhere, in every village, wearing down the enemy, and flexibly and mobilely striking the enemy, repelling their looting, thus winning combat victories. The remaining militia were systematically assigned to each village to specialize in suppressing bad elements, investigating spies and secret agents, so that the "Returning Home Corps" special agents could not infiltrate the villages. Secondly, attention was paid to taking care of the family members of cadres and militia, designating a group of cadres to be specifically responsible. The county established reception centers to accommodate the families of cadres and militia, organize them, systematically resettle them in the rear, and systematically transfer them, thus relieving the great concerns of the cadres and militia. Thirdly, public grain was systematically distributed to each village, and militia companies could be supplied with public grain everywhere, which could avoid the public grain being looted by the stubborn puppets, and on the other hand, solved the supply problem of the militia, so as to avoid the militia eating in whichever village they went to, and reduced the burden on the masses.

    (3) Launching a political offensive in coordination with military operations.

First of all, current affairs education was conducted among cadres and militia, and then village meetings and gentry symposiums were generally convened to expose the Kuomintang's conspiracy, promptly publicize victory news, and conduct extensive propaganda. In addition, the government issued announcements, declaring Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of selling out the country and attacking the liberated areas, and held symposiums with the families of stubborn puppets, and issued letters to the stubborn puppet soldiers and to the fleeing landlords' Returning Home Corps, … creating a strong revolutionary public opinion, overwhelming evil rumors. The reaction of the masses was "the stubborn cannot last long, the Eighth Route Army has a way." The families of the masses were not panicked, greatly supporting and consolidating the morale of the militia.

    (4) The main cadres persisted on the front line of struggle, and their exemplary actions and determination to struggle influenced the masses.

The comrades of each county party committee took concrete leadership and participated in the activities of the militia in one district, leading the way in striking the enemy. For example, Comrade Luo Boxing, director of the Armed Forces Committee, led the militia of Zhanggulou, Chengguan, Haozhai and other districts on the front line of struggle, actively attacking and harassing the enemy. Cadres and the masses had high confidence. Some cadres said, "Originally I was timid, but following Director Luo's activities, my courage has grown."

　　认识一致布置周密
    沛县游击战广泛展开
    自上月二十二日顽军进占沛县城后，全县广泛的游击战展开了，粉碎了敌人在城以外按据点建立区乡政权的企图。顽军除占据一孤城外，在广大的乡村中、无插足之地。非法特务地主“还乡团”，不敢还家；敌政工人员，闷住在城里不敢妄动；我们则保持了广大乡村的革命秩序。沛县游击运动为啥搞的好呢？主要有以下几个问题：
    （一）及时深入动员掌握干部思想树立了对顽展开游击战的观念与信心。
    上月底顽军占我沛丰县城后，不少的干部群众，曾对坚持沦陷区游击战的信心不足。县委即及时分别召开了全区干部大会，结合研究时事，纠正了干部思想上的偏向，明示了非法地主、流氓分子在乡村中是孤立的，少数的。经过群运解决土地问题后，我们广大群众有相当数量的民兵。敌人愈深入解放区，兵力愈分散，我们有着广大的乡村活动，我们具备着开展游击战的一切有利条件。再则，只有我们游击战搞得好，牵制敌人配合主力正面作战，才能更快的收复失地，取得自卫战争的胜利。这样，在干部中建立了单独展开群众性游击战的观念与信心。
    （二）建立了适应新环境的新的组织领导。
    顽军开始占领县城时，县委会号召全县民兵紧急动员起来，以区为单位集中民兵，拉成对沛县顽军的一条阻击防线。但由于组织庞大，掌握与指挥活动都不方便，如遭遇敌人袭击也易于紊乱。于是便进行了精编工作，县指挥部掌握若干精干的民兵连，配合县大队，作为展开游击战的基干力量。各区选择精干民兵编为一小队，区干部，有计划编入连队，每区指挥部掌握几个小队，另外更选择优良枪枝与精明勇敢善战的民兵，组织短小精干的武工队，深入敌后或城区活动。在整个地区，则是大股武装支持小股武装，展开广泛的小股分散活动，做到到处打、村村打，疲困敌人，灵活机动的打击敌人，打退敌人的抢掠，这样就获得了战斗的胜利。其余民兵则有计划的分别到各村专事镇压坏分子的活动，清查奸细特务，使“还乡团”特务分子无法打入村里工作。其次是重视了照顾家属工作，指定一批干部专门负责，县设立招待所，收容干部、民兵的家属，进行编制，有计划的安置在后方，有计划的转移，这样解除了干部、民兵的莫大顾虑。再次，有计划的将公粮分散到每个村，民兵连队到处都可以由公粮供给，一方面可避免公粮被顽伪抢掠，另方面解决了民兵的供给问题，免得民兵走到那村吃那村，减轻了群众负担。
    （三）配合军事行动展开了政治攻势。
    首先在干部中、民兵中进行时事教育，然后普遍召开村民会，士绅座谈会，揭穿国民党的阴谋，及时公布胜利消息，进行广泛宣传。另外由政府出布告，宣布蒋介石出卖国家及进攻解放区的罪行，并召开了顽伪家属座谈会，发表了告顽伪军士兵书及告逃亡地主还乡团书，………造成了浓厚的革命舆论，压倒了邪气谣言。群众的反映是“顽固长不了，八路军有办法”。群众家属不恐慌，大大的支持和巩固了民兵的情绪。
    （四）主要干部坚持斗争前线，以身作则的模范行动和斗争决心影响了群众。
    各县委同志均具体领导，和参加一个区民兵的活动，身先士卒的打击敌人。如武委会主任罗伯行同志，在斗争前线，领导张古楼、城关、郝寨等区的民兵，积极打击袭扰敌人。干部群众信心都很高，有的干部说：“本来我的胆子小，跟着罗主任活动，胆子都变大了。”（本报冀鲁豫二十五日电）
