Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: A Chongqing dispatch: More than 50 people from the Chongqing literary and art circles, including Shen Qiyu, Li Yang, and Ai Wu, gathered on the 29th of last month to respond to the "American Troops Get Out of China" movement. At the meeting, Nie Gannu said, "The Chinese people have repelled countless hands of aggression. If the American demon hand does not withdraw, the Chinese people will definitely have the strength to repel it!" Liu Qian said: "We should expose Marshall's deceitful face so that he can no longer deceive. If the American troops commit atrocities again, we don't need to hand them over to the government; we can directly hand them over to the people for public trial. We must turn the rear into the front and expel American imperialism!" Li Wenzhao, in response to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war policy, said: "The Chinese people used the spirit of the 'May Fourth' Movement to settle accounts with Cao Rulin; today, we should carry forward the spirit of the 'May Fourth' Movement to eliminate 'Cao Rulin the Second'." Chen Heshan pointed out: "America's behavior in China today is no different from that of Hitler. The Chinese people will use the means of resisting Japanese fascism to drive out the American troops! At the same time, we should also eliminate the comprador class, the accomplices of American imperialism." Xiao Manruo warned the American government that if it does not turn back, its fate will be even more miserable than that of Japanese fascism. Sha Ou proposed that the literary and art circles should strengthen two tasks: 1. Use various methods to accuse the American troops of their atrocities in China to the world; 2. Launch a non-cooperation movement with the American troops. Shen Qiyu added: "The most important task for our writers at present is how to use literature and art to make the people re-recognize the United States and how to expose the aggressive nature of the United States." Speakers at the meeting also included Ai Wu, He Bo, Li Lan, Bai Yan, Wu Sihong, Meng Chao, He Qifang, and many others, who unanimously advocated expelling American troops from China and opposing China's foreign slaves. Finally, Li Yang summarized everyone's opinions: 1. Publicly declare that the opinions of the Chinese representative in the Security Council do not represent the opinions of the Chinese people; the Chinese people unanimously demand that American troops withdraw from China; 2. Write to American writers and Cao Yu and Lao She, members of the Chinese Writers Association in the United States, to express the opinions of Chinese writers; 3. Advise cinemas not to show American films and promote the boycott of American goods; 4. Strengthen the content of various newspaper supplements and reflect the people's demand for American troops to withdraw from China in literature and art.

    要求驱逐美军出中国
    主张揭露马歇尔的欺骗面孔
    【新华社延安十七日电】渝讯：渝市文艺界沈起予、力扬、艾芜等五十余人，于上月廿九日集会，响应“美军退出中国”运动。会中聂绀弩说：“中国人民已经击退了无数只侵略的手，如果美国这只魔手不撤回去，中国人民一定有力量击退它”！柳倩说：“我们应揭露马歇尔的欺骗面孔，叫他无法再欺骗下去，美军如再有暴行，我们不必交政府，可以直接交人民公开审判，要把后方变成前方，驱逐美帝国主义！”李文钊针对蒋介石的卖国内战政策说：“中国人民用‘五四’精神，清算了曹汝霖；今天应发扬‘五四’精神来清除‘曹汝霖第二’。”陈和山指出：“美国今天在华的行为，虽希特勒亦不过如此，中国人民将用迎击日本法西斯的手段，将美军赶出去！同时，亦应把美帝国主义的帮手买办阶级一起清除。”萧曼若警告美国政府，如不回头，他的命运将较日本法西斯更惨。沙鸥提出目前文艺界应加强两项工作：一、用各种方法，向全世界控诉美军在华暴行；二、要展开和美军不合作运动。沈起予补充说：“我们作家目前最重要的工作，便是如何通过文艺叫人民重新认识美国，如何揭露美国的侵略性。”会中发言者，尚有艾芜、禾波、李兰、白岩、吴似鸿、孟超、何其芳等多人，一致主张驱逐美军出中国，反对中国的洋奴才。最后由力扬总结大家意见：一、公开宣言否认安理会中国代表的意见是代表中国人民的意见，中国人民一致要求美军退出中国；二、致书美国作家及旅美文协会员曹禺、老舍，表达中国作家的意见；三、劝告电影院不放美国片，推广抵制美货运动；四、加强各报副刊内容，从文艺上反映人民要求美军退出中国的意见。
