　　Retired Veterans Re-enter the Battlefield
　　170 People in Wuxiang Await Departure
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi 24th dispatch] Over 170 retired veterans from the third district of Wuxiang, filled with indignation at the unreasonable attacks by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, specifically gathered on the 5th and 6th to request a return to the battlefield. Honorably discharged soldier Li Fu said: "In the past ten years of civil war, we grew stronger with each fight. Now, Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to eliminate us is a delusion. I request that the higher-ups issue an order, transferring us back to the front lines to fight him." Comrade Cao Anyi said: "I was discharged last year, and the cadres and masses helped me establish a household. Now Chiang Kai-shek is unreasonably attacking, preventing us from living well. Only by fighting him to the end can we have good times." Everyone was filled with anger, awaiting orders to return to the battlefield.

　　荣退军人重上战场
    武乡百七十人待命出发
    【本报长治二十四日电】武乡三区一百七十余荣退军人，愤恨蒋军无理进攻，特于五、六两日集会，要求重上战场。荣誉军人李福说：“过去十年内战，我们越打越强大，现在蒋介石想消灭我们是妄想，我要求上级下个命令，调我们重上前线和他干。”曹安义同志说：“我去年退伍，干部群众帮我建立了家务，蒋介石又来无理进攻，不叫我们好好活，只有和他干到底，才有我们的好时光。”人人怒气冲天，待命重赴战场。
