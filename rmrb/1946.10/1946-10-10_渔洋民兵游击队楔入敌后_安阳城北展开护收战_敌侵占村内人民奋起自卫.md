[Changzhi Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 6th] In the northern Anyang area, mass guerrilla warfare has also been widely developed during this autumn harvest defense. The light guerrilla teams organized by the militia in the Yuyang town area have extended their activities into the Houzhunqu village area (south bank of the Zhang River, both sides of the Pinghan Railway) occupied by the puppet army Wang Ziquan. They not only attacked small-scale deployments of the puppet army, covered the autumn harvest on the border and the night-time return of refugees from occupied villages to rush harvest, but also launched enemy-rear guerrilla warfare among the people in the occupied villages. With the cover of the militia and the help of the masses in the Yuyang area, the occupied villages of Qian Houzhunqu, etc., recovered more than 700 mu of grain in two nights. This not only solved the livelihood of the refugees, but also left the Chiang Kai-shek puppets with no grain to loot. At the same time, in villages close to the occupied areas, landmine warfare has also been widely launched. Dong Hejiafen village made more than 100 stone mines during the autumn harvest, and all roads were blocked by stone mines at night. Due to the development of guerrilla movements, the masses in various villages were able to harvest with peace of mind. The harvesting has now been completed, and they are launching a surprise attack on grain storage.

[Changzhi News from Our Newspaper] Our Shimen Liberation Detachment, combined with the militia, destroyed a stubborn county government car on the Shihuo Highway, killing and wounding the pseudo-county magistrate and capturing six people alive. On the 8th of last month, Liang Dezhu, chairman of the Stubborn (referring to forces loyal to the Kuomintang) Huolu County Reconstruction and Promotion Association (actually a supply bureau for stubborn troops), was captured in Zhangying Village near the military camp west of Shimen.

　　渔洋民兵游击队楔入敌后
    安阳城北展开护收战
    敌侵占村内人民奋起自卫
    【本报长治六日电】安阳北部地区在此次保卫秋收中，群众游击战亦获广泛展开。渔洋镇一带民兵组织的轻便游击队，已伸入伪军王自全侵占的后准渠村一带（漳河南岸，平汉两侧）活动，不仅打击了伪军的小股出动，掩护了边地秋收与被占村庄逃出难民的夜间回去抢收，并展开了被占村庄人民的敌后游击战。在民兵掩护与渔洋一带群众帮助，被占的前后准渠等村，两夜即收回谷子七百余亩。此举不仅使难民生活解决，亦使蒋伪无粮可抢。同时在接近被占区的村庄，地雷战，亦普遍展开。东何家坟村，在秋收中打造石雷达百余个，夜间所有道路都被石雷封锁。由于游击运动的开展，各村群众得以安心收割，现收打均已完成，正突击藏粮中。
    【本报长治讯】我石门解放大队结合民兵，在石获公路打毁顽县署汽车一辆，除毙伤伪县长外，并生俘六人。上月八日又于石门西兵营附近张营村捉获顽获鹿县复员协进会（实际为顽军支应局）理事长梁德柱。
