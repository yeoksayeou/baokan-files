　　Cordell Hull

　　Hull, an important aide to Roosevelt's New Deal, was recently assassinated by reactionary naval personnel and seriously injured. We, on behalf of the Chinese people, extend our condolences to this septuagenarian who worked for peace!

　　The despicable assassination methods commonly used by Hitler in Germany and Italy, and by Chiang Kai-shek in China, have surprisingly appeared in the United States in another form. This does not indicate the strength of the American reactionaries, but precisely their cowardice. A person like Hull, who advocates moderation and is over seventy years old, is someone the reactionaries dare not publicly debate, resorting instead to secretly assassinating him. This proves how unspeakable the reactionaries' faces are, how extremely isolated they are among the people, and how frightened they are by the growing peace and democratic movement of the American people!

　　The reactionaries are successively squeezing out the old guard of the Roosevelt New Deal from the cabinet, even resorting to fascist terror to deal with them. However, this precisely promotes greater awareness and unity among the American people. We firmly believe that the American people can defeat the reactionaries. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　慰赫尔
    罗斯福新政的重要助手赫尔，于日前遭反动的海军人员行刺，伤势颇重，我们代表中国人民向这位为和平努力的七秩老人致慰问之意！
    希墨在德意，蒋介石在中国所惯用的卑鄙暗杀手段，居然在美国以另一种方式出现了，这并不表示美国反动派之强，而恰恰表示它的怯弱。像赫尔这样一位主张温和年逾古稀的人物，反动派不敢对他公开展开争论，而偷偷摸摸地对他实行暗杀，这证明反动派的面目是如何见不得人，它在人民间是如何极端孤立，它对日益增长的美国人民和平民主运动是如何惊惶失措！
    反动派把罗斯福新政的旧人相继排挤出阁，甚至采取法西斯恐怖手段来对付他们，但是这恰恰促进美国人民更加觉悟团结。我们坚信美国人民能够击败反动派。（新华社）
