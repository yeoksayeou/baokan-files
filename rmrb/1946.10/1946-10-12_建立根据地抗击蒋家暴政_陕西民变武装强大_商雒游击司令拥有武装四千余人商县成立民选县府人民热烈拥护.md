Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: A dispatch from Xi'an reports: In recent times, the people north and south of the Qinling Mountains and on both banks of the Wei River have risen up in rebellion, taking up arms to resist Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny. According to disclosures in the official newspapers of Xi'an alone, the people's armed uprisings in various parts of Shaanxi total over 6,000 people, and their areas of activity encompass more than 20 counties. Among them, the people's armed forces in southern Shaanxi have the greatest momentum. Led by Gong Defang and Wang Lie as commander and deputy commander respectively, they have established the "Shangluo Guerrilla Headquarters" in Zhongcai Town, Shanyang County. According to statistics, this unit has approximately 4,700 people, active in the vast villages and towns of Shanyang, Shang County, Luonan, Heyang, Feng County, Xunyang, Zhen'an, Lantian, and other eight counties, and has established base areas in Shanyang, Shang County, and other places. The unit led by Jiang Xingyun has even established a popularly elected county government in Jiangjiachuan, Shang County. In the Fenpisha area of this county, the people of various villages have been enthusiastically joining this unit in large numbers recently, with as many as 30 to 50 people participating from each Bao. They possess rifles, short guns, and machine guns, and have engaged in more than a hundred battles, large and small, with Chiang Kai-shek's regular army and local militias. On July 29th, the people's armed forces of Zhashui approached the county seat, scaring the county magistrate and police chief into fleeing. They also once attacked and entered the town of Zhen'an County, resulting in the dismissal and investigation of County Magistrate Zhao Wenbin. Now, the Kuomintang officials are forced to admit that "local militias cannot suppress them" and feel greatly "exhausted by the encirclement and suppression."

In the Guanzhong area, from Huayin in the east to Baoji in the west, along the Longhai Railway line in the townships of Weinan, Hua County, Luoyang, Qishan, Fufeng, Linyou, Long County, Wugong, Fengxiang, Baoji, and other ten counties, there are also over a thousand people's armed forces, under the leadership of Wang Ziwei, Wang Ziping, Wang Zhenjie, and others, engaging in combat with Chiang's troops. Each unit has more than a hundred people, and some have dozens, armed with mostly short guns and submachine guns, "appearing and disappearing unpredictably," causing Chiang's side to be "overwhelmed."

In Luochuan, Baishui, Pucheng, Yichuan, Tongguan, Yijun, and other six counties, there are also several people's armed forces, with approximately two hundred people and guns, led by Wang Zhijie, Dong Xingmin, and others, who have repeatedly fought against Chiang's troops. On August 17th, Wang Zhijie's unit of more than forty people ambushed Fu Yun, the special commissioner of the Kuomintang's Third Special District of Shaanxi, in Bianqiao Town, Yijun, causing Fu to flee in terror. In mid-August, they dragged Wang Yuhai, a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent who was committing evil in the countryside, into the mountains and killed him.

The Kuomintang authorities have launched offensives against the Shaanxi people's armed forces—"encirclements," "village cleansing"—but have been met with fierce resistance from the people's armed forces, and mutinies have repeatedly occurred among Chiang's troops during the "encirclement and suppression." For example, the Second Detachment of the Shang County Security Police was ordered on August 5th to proceed to Baiyu Township for "encirclement and suppression." When they arrived at Gulong Temple, squad leader He Jiabin, in consultation with soldier Jiang Benzheng, killed the captain and immediately revolted, leading the entire team to escape towards Huazi Mountain. Furthermore, the Baiyu Township Self-Defense Force, consisting of more than thirty people led by the captain, rushed to the township office on August 7th, shouting "Surrender your guns," scaring the township chief away and confiscating the weapons.

　　建立根据地抗击蒋家暴政
    陕西民变武装强大
    商雒游击司令拥有武装四千余人商县成立民选县府人民热烈拥护
    【新华社延安九日电】西安讯：秦岭南北及渭水两岸的人民，近来纷纷举义，武装反抗蒋介石的暴政。仅据西安的官方报纸透露，陕西各地民变武装约计在六千人以上，他们的活动地区达二十多县。其中陕南人民武装声势最大，以巩得芳、王烈为正副司令，已在山阳县中材镇成立了“商雒游击司令部”，据统计该部约四千七百余人，活跃于山阳、商县、雒南、＠城、凤县、洵阳、镇安、蓝田等八县的广大村镇，并在山阳商县等地建立了根据地。其中蒋兴运部且已在商县蒋家川成立了民选县政府；该县粉皮沙一带，近来各村人民参加该部者极为踊跃，每保参加者竟至三五十人之多。他们拥有长短步枪及机枪，曾与蒋家正规军及地方团队作过百余次大小战斗。七月二十九日，柞水人民武装曾逼近县城，吓得县长警察局长等都逃走一空。并曾一度攻入镇安县城，以致县长赵文斌被革职查办了。现在国民党官方亦不得不承认“非地方团队所能剿灭”，并大感“疲于进剿”。
    在关中方面，东迄华阴，西至宝鸡，沿陇海路一线之渭南、华县、洛阳、岐山、扶风、麟游、陇县、武功、凤翔、宝鸡等十县之乡镇中，亦有千余人民武装，在王子威、王子平、王振杰等领导下，时与蒋军作战。每支多者百余人，少者数十人，武器多为短枪及冲锋机枪，“出没无常”，使蒋方“应接不暇”。
    在洛川、白水、蒲城、宜川、同官、宜君、等六县，亦有数支人民武装，人枪约二百余，领袖为王志杰、董醒民等，曾多次与蒋军作战。八月十七日，王志杰部四十余人在宜君扁桥镇截击国民党陕西第三区特务专员傅云，傅抱头鼠窜。八月中并将下乡作恶的蒋介石特务王玉海拖到山里杀死。
    国民党当局对陕西人民武装举行进攻——“包剿”、“清乡”，但遭人民武装奋勇抗击，“进剿”之蒋军并迭次发生兵变。如商县保警第二分队奉命于八月五日开赴白玉乡“进剿”，当行至谷龙庙时，班长贺嘉宾商同士兵蒋本正，将队长杀死，当即起义，全部率队向华子山逸去。又白玉乡自卫队三十余人，由队长率领，于八月七日冲至乡公所，高呼“收枪”，将乡长吓跑，缴枪而去。
