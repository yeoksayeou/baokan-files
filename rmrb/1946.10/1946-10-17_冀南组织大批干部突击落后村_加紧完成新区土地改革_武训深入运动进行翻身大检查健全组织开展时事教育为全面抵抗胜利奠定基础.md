[This newspaper's Weixian, 15th dispatch] In the new districts of Jinnan's twenty-two counties, "land to the tiller" has now been achieved or is being implemented. In Yongzhi County, out of 300 villages, 200 have completed land reform. In Dashan Village, each person owns an average of 3.16 mu of land. An enlarged county-level cadre meeting is currently being held to reorganize forces and make breakthroughs in backward villages. In the fourth district of Handan, each farmer in 23 villages has an average of four to eight mu of land. The third district, with 70 villages, has initially implemented "land to the tiller," and since September 2nd, has entered a period of thorough emancipation inspections to completely resolve remaining issues. In Ningnan County, 35 out of 110 villages have achieved "land to the tiller," and everyone has a place to live. Since late September, large numbers of cadres have been transferred to backward villages to make breakthroughs in "blank areas." Farmers in 34 administrative villages in the fourth district have now recovered 10,439 mu of land. Farmers in 25 out of 40 villages in the fifth district have been mobilized, recovering 4,298 mu of land, 90,000 jin of grain, compensation of 9.1 million yuan in cash, and 266 houses. Farmers in Beixu Village have recovered a total of 3,532 mu of land, which, together with the original 2,582.3 mu, accounts for 75.7% of the village's land, with an average of 4.65 mu of land per person. The movement in Wuxun has been launched in 90% of the county's villages. In addition to organizing forces to make breakthroughs in backward villages, the leadership is now deepening the movement, conducting thorough emancipation inspections, reorganizing the organization, and intensifying current affairs education to lay a solid foundation for winning a comprehensive victory in resistance.
