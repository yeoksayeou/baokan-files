　　Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls For:
    Launching a Military Enlistment Campaign
    [This newspaper’s Taihang dispatch, 2nd] The local Xinhua Daily published an editorial today calling for "launching a vigorous military enlistment campaign to support the self-defense front."
    The editorial stated roughly: Supported by American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek has even more肆意展開了进攻 against our liberated areas, attempting to eliminate the Eighth Route Army, eliminate the liberated areas, and once again plunge our people, who have already achieved liberation, into the disasters of feudal autocracy. If we do not crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, we will not be able to live and work in peace; our fruits of liberation will be taken away; our autumn harvest will be plundered; we will not be able to survive. We must crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and we will certainly be able to crush his offensive! For the victory on the front lines, "全力支援前线," this is our current action slogan. Although it is now the busy season of autumn harvest and autumn plowing, in order to achieve victory in the patriotic self-defense war, various localities have launched military enlistment campaigns. This is a crucial key to determining the outcome of the war. Without good men bravely going to the front lines, without a constant source of replenishment of soldiers, the self-defense war cannot achieve the victory it deserves and will suffer unnecessary losses. We should make the people of the entire region understand the current situation, understand that the victory of the self-defense war is the victory of complete liberation. This is a matter of defending our families and children. Everyone should rise up and set off a region-wide upsurge in military enlistment!
    In recent years, the masses of the entire region have demonstrated great enthusiasm in military enlistment. We must carry forward this fine tradition and enthusiasm, lead in a planned manner, and fully develop the mass line leadership method; discover and cultivate a large number of activists to respond to the call, mobilize the masses, and complete this task with the greatest speed. Then, concentrate our efforts to continue to implement the mass liberation movement, and the rent reduction and production movement in the old areas. Use military enlistment and combat to defend the fruits of liberation; use the liberation and production movements to support the victorious combat on the front lines.

　　太行新华日报号召：
    开展参军运动
    【本报太行二日电】此间新华日报于本日发表社论号召“开展热烈的参军运动，支援自卫前线”。
    社论略谓：蒋介石在美帝国主义的支援之下，更加肆意的向我各解放区展开了进攻，妄想消灭八路军，消灭解放区，再置我已经翻身的人民于封建独裁的灾难中。不粉碎蒋介石的进攻，我们将不能够安居乐业；我们的翻身果实将被剥夺；我们的秋收将被抢掠；我们将不能够生存。我们必须粉碎蒋介石的进攻，我们也必然能粉碎其进攻！为了前线的胜利，“全力支援前线”，这是我们当前的行动口号。现在虽然在秋收秋耕的农忙时期，为了爱国自卫战争胜利，各地都发动了参军运动。这是决定战争胜负的重要关键，没有好男儿英勇上前线，没有兵员的源源补充，自卫战争就不能取得应有的胜利，就会遭受不应有的损失。应该使全区人民了解目前的形势，了解自卫战争的胜利就是彻底翻身的胜利。这是保卫身家儿女的问题，大家奋发起来，掀起全区的参军热潮！
    几年来，全区群众在参军中间，都表现了高度的热情，我们必须发扬这种优良传统与热情，有计划的领导，充分发扬群众路线的领导方法；发现与培养大批积极分子响应号召，动员群众，以最大的速度完成这一任务。然后集中力量，继续贯彻群众翻身运动，与老区的查减和生产运动。以参军作战，保卫翻身果实；以翻身与生产运动，支援前线胜利作战。
