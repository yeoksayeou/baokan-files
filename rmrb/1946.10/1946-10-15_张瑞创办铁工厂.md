Cooperation hero of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, Zhang Rui, became extremely interested in the issue of industrial development after reading Chairman Mao's "On Coalition Government" in June of last year. At that time, he wanted to develop his hand-created cooperative towards industrial production, but at that time he was only operating a five-village joint cooperative with only 500,000 yuan of capital, and it was indeed not an easy task to create industry with such a small amount of capital. Last winter, when he attended the Chahar Provincial People's Representative Conference and visited a factory, he negotiated with the provincial government for a lathe, and from then on, he was determined to establish an iron factory.

But with only one lathe, he could not sand cast or smelt iron. So, he ran to the Xushui County Cooperative and found two gasoline barrels, and personally ran to Gaolin Village and carried back the iron bars from the bridge that the enemy had destroyed during their retreat. After painstaking research, he transformed the gasoline barrels into "furnace barrels" and the iron bars into "furnace shafts," and a "new-style" furnace was built. But without a windmill, iron could still not be melted, so Zhang Rui designed and built a wooden windmill himself. An old worker who had worked in an iron factory for more than 40 years dissuaded him: "It won't work to use wood, the windmill will rot as soon as the big wheel is turned." Some people also joked with him: "If wooden sticks can be chiseled and ground, who would want to buy steel drills!" But Lao Zhang smiled and said: "Let's try it." After the "wooden windmill" was made, the windmill did not rot when the big wheel was turned, and the wind power was about the same as that made of steel. After the successful trial of the large windmill, Zhang Rui went to Gaolin Village and borrowed the iron sticks that the elementary school students wanted to play with to use as "fire pokers," and borrowed two color buckets from the dyeing workshop in Humu Village and transformed them into "carrying bags." At this point, a complete set of iron smelting furnaces was basically complete.

But the small tools commonly used by ironworkers, such as iron pliers and hammers, were all missing, and the workers and cadres felt difficult and unhappy. But Zhang Rui said: "Let's make our own! In the beginning, did the first tool fall from the sky?" So, he first melted iron and cast a few "hammers," and then borrowed a few pairs of pliers from the local blacksmith to make various small tools. The basic "machines" and tools of an iron factory were becoming complete.

However, without raw materials, especially the lack of coal and iron, work still could not begin. Buy it with money? Zhang Rui had no money. But he had a very close flesh-and-blood connection with the people of Xushui, and the people of Xushui affectionately called him "Old Man" or "Uncle Zhang." A certain gentry, out of gratitude for Zhang Rui's education and care during the War of Resistance Against Japan, automatically transported 90 tons of coal to Zhang Rui when he learned that the iron factory had no fuel, saying that he would pay it back whenever he had money. Zhao Guochen of Humu Village, who had quit his smoking addiction with the help of Lao Zhang, also automatically took out a submachine gun and two Mauser pistols that had been buried for eight or nine years and handed them over to Lao Zhang. Zhang Rui transferred these guns to the village militias who were often invaded by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and exchanged them for the scrap iron he needed from the militias. In this way, Zhang Rui, with his extraordinary wisdom and perseverance, after two or three months of hard work and painstaking management, the iron factory finally started work.

By the spring of this year, Zhang Rui's iron factory had begun to cast waterwheels urgently needed for mass production and construction. Later, after Lao Zhang's design and improvement, "rollers" were added to the axle of the waterwheel, reducing the pulling weight by half and greatly saving labor. The "Zhang Rui Waterwheel" was widely adopted, and even farmers eighty or ninety miles away came to order it. By June, Zhang Rui's iron factory had manufactured 40 waterwheels. The scale of the iron factory has also been expanding day by day, with a sand casting factory, a machine factory, and a woodworking factory. In addition, a lithographic printing group is also attached. In order to adapt to the inevitable development of the textile industry caused by the large-scale cotton planting in the border area, the iron factory plans to manufacture a large number of cotton gins, cotton carding machines, and looms after autumn, and will start manufacturing "lathe beds" around the end of the year. Zhang Rui often said to others: "We must do everything possible to strive to manufacture lathes before the end of the year, so that large and small iron factories can be established everywhere in our border area."

　　张瑞创办铁工厂
    晋察冀边区合作英雄张瑞，在去年六月间看到了毛主席的“论联合政府”，特别对发展工业问题他发生了极大的兴趣。当时，他就想将他手创的合作社向工业生产方面发展，但那时他只经营一个仅有五十万元资金的五村联合社，以区区的资本创建工业，的确不是件容易事。去冬他出席察省人民代表会议，参观某工厂时，便同省府交涉要求了一个旋床，从此他决心要创办一个铁工厂。
    但仅有一个旋床，也不能翻砂炼铁，于是，他跑到徐水县联社找来两个汽油桶，又亲自跑到高林村把敌人退却时破坏了的桥上的铁条搬了回来，经过苦心钻研，他把汽油桶改造成了“炉桶”，铁条作了“炉轴”，于是一个“新式”的熔炉便建造成了。但没有风车仍然不能化铁，张瑞就自己设计造木头风车。一个曾在铁厂作工四十余年的老工人劝阻他：“用木材作不行，大轮子一摇风车就烂了。”也有人同他开玩笑：“木棍子能凿磨，谁还要买钢钻！”但老张却笑笑地说：“试试看。”“木风车”作好后，大轮子一摇风车并没有烂，而且风力和钢铁制造的差不多少。大风车试验成功后，张瑞就到高林村把小学生要着玩的铁棍子借了来当“通火棍”，到户木村染房借来两个颜色桶改造成“抬包”。至此一套炼铁炉便大体齐备了。
    但铁工日常用的小工具，如铁钳、锤子等全没有，工人们和干部们都感到困难并且不高兴。但张瑞说：“咱们自己造！当初，那第一个工具难道是天上掉下来的吗？”于是先化铁铸了几个“锤子”，又从本地铁匠处借来几把钳子制造了各种小工具，一个铁工厂的起码的“机器”与工具是趋于完备了。
    然而没有原料，特别是缺乏煤铁仍然不能开工。用钱买吗？张瑞没有钱。可是他同徐水人民有着非常密切的血肉联系，徐水人民都亲热的叫他“老头儿”或“张伯伯”。某士绅因感谢抗战期间张瑞对他的教育和关心，当他知道铁工厂没燃料，便自动运来九十吨煤，借给张瑞，说什么时候有了钱什么时候还。还有在老张帮助下戒了烟瘾的户木村赵虢臣也自动把埋藏了八九年的一支冲锋枪，两支驳壳枪拿出来交给老张。张瑞就把这些枪转送给常遭蒋伪军进犯的村庄民兵们，从民兵们那里换回了他所需要的碎铁。就这样，张瑞用他超人的智慧和毅力，经过两三个月的埋头钻研，艰苦经营，铁厂终于开工了。
    到今年春天张瑞铁工厂已开始铸造群众生产建设迫切需要的水车。后又经老张的设计改良，将水车轮轴处添铸“滚珠”、减轻了拉重一倍，大大的节省了劳动力。“张瑞水车”便被广泛的采用，连八九十里外的农民也前来订购。至六月，张瑞铁工厂已制造水车四十辆。铁工厂规模也日益扩大，内设有一个翻砂厂、一个机器厂、和一个木工厂。另外还附设了一个石印组。为适应边区大量植棉所引起的纺织业的必然发展，在秋后铁厂计划大量制造轧花机、弹花机和织布机，年底前后即开始制造“床子”。张瑞经常向别人说：“我们要尽一切力量争取年底前能制造车床，使咱们边区到处建立起大大小小的铁厂。”
