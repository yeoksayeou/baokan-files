　　Chiang Kai-shek's Plane Attacks Yantai
    Shot Down by Our Forces
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dongtai, 2nd] A U.S.-made P-11 type No. 275 Chiang Kai-shek's small fighter plane flew from Qingdao to attack Yantai city at approximately 2 PM on the 26th, and scattered absurd leaflets such as "Self-Renewal Certificates." The local military and civilians immediately retaliated, and the plane was hit, caught fire, and crashed near the Zhu Ruo Village river in Fushan, 20 li south of Yantai city. The fuselage and six heavy machine guns were completely burned. The lieutenant pilot parachuted into the river and was captured. According to him, he is 29 years old, from Suzhou. In 1942, he was sent to the United States for training. In 1943, after returning to China, he was assigned to the 27th Squadron of the 5th Group of Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force. After the Japanese surrender, he was transferred to Nanjing and participated in the civil war in northern Jiangsu. Later, on August 25th, he was transferred from Nanjing to Qingdao, with the mission of assisting the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Jiaoji Railway line in attacking the Jiaodong Liberated Area.
