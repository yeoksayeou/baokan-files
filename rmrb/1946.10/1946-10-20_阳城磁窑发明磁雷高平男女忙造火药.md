　　Yangcheng Cixiao invents magnetic mines, Gaoping men and women are busy making gunpowder
    [Report from this newspaper in Yangcheng] Workers at the Cixiao Cooperative in Jiangli Village, Yangcheng, are actively researching ways to serve the war effort and have now invented several new types of enemy-killing weapons - explosive magnetic mines: one is a jar mine, one is a gourd mine, and one is a muffled pot mine. Samples have now been fired, and tests by Liang Yaoting, director of the district farmers' association, combat hero Ye Mingzhu, and others have shown them to be very effective. The masses are clamoring to fire more magnetic mines to supply the militia to crush the Chiang bandit's offensive. (Liang Yaoting)
    [Report from this newspaper in Gaoping] The masses in the entire Fourth District of this county are actively equipping themselves with weapons, replenishing ammunition, and strengthening their combat power in preparation to defend their homes. Militiamen and self-defense forces are rushing to make gunpowder, repair guns, and practice tactics day and night; women and children are cutting wormwood and burning ash to supply gunpowder raw materials, burning 40,000 catties of ash in two days. The women in this district are also enthusiastically making military shoes for the soldiers at the front. In five days, they completed 3,530 pairs, each weighing one and a half catties. They said, "There is a lot of running in battle, the stronger the shoes the better!" The five villages of Xizhuang, Sanjia, etc. were awarded banners by the district office for their particularly strong and beautiful military shoes. (Qinghua)
