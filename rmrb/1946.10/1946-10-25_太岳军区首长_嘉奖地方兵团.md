　　Taiyue Military Region Leaders
    Commend Local Military Groups
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch of the 23rd] The local military groups of the first and second sub-districts of the Taiyue Military Region have been actively engaged in continuous activities, annihilating the invading Chiang's troops and achieving repeated victories. The leaders of the Taiyue Military Region have issued another circular to commend them. The original telegram briefly stated: Under the circumstances of the main force of Chiang's troops pressing the border and launching a large-scale invasion, our troops in the second sub-district have always maintained a strong fighting spirit, actively launched offensives, and continuously attacked the invading Chiang's troops, successively recovering the Fuyi Highway and the Xiangling Liberated Area. They were also able to grasp the patterns of the invading Chiang's troops and set up ambushes in Chenyan and Guanque. With the combined wisdom and courage of our commanders and fighters, they created a brilliant example of quickly and decisively annihilating the fourth company of the 80th Regiment of the 27th Brigade of Chiang's army at a very small cost. The troops of our first sub-district were even more able to concentrate their strength to attack the invading Yan's puppet troops, ambushing them at Junzhai, Lingshi, and with calm, courageous, sudden and decisive actions, annihilating one battalion of Yan's army in 30 minutes. This brilliant example of responding to the superior's call to "fight more annihilation battles, accumulate small victories into big victories, and annihilate the enemy's effective strength" should be widely promoted.
