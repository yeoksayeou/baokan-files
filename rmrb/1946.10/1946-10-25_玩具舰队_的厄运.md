The Doom of the "Toy Fleet"
    Shanghai Dispatch
    The "toy fleet" received back from the United States, which the Kuomintang government called the "New Fleet," was left idle in Nanjing for two months. It was not until mid-September that three ships were dispatched to patrol the Jiangyin area. Besides the retirement disputes, insiders said there was also the issue of "American equipment." The "New Fleet" ships, including the eating utensils, were all "American equipped" without exception. However, the trouble started when the ships left the United States, and everything became problematic. First, there was the water issue. American docks had complete tap water facilities, making it convenient to fill the ships with water. But in China, there were too few ports with such facilities. The ships were too small to have water filters. The river water had too much mud and sand and was undrinkable. When the fleet arrived in Nanjing, the "American equipment" became useless, and they had to resort to primitive Chinese labor, sending people ashore to carry water every day.

    Eating was as difficult as getting water. In the United States, they ate Western food, but in China, they had to switch to Chinese food. However, the bread-baking racks could not be used to roast pork, and the refrigerators for milk could not store all sorts of Chinese dishes. Even the bowls and chopsticks had to be bought separately. The ships were too small to have a place to install a large pot for cooking rice. Once, they bought dozens of pounds of pork, but the refrigerator could not hold it, and it all went bad.

    The most troublesome issue was the repair and maintenance of the ships. The crew members learned some navigation skills from the Americans, but the Americans refused to teach repair techniques. During the training period, when they encountered deeper technical subjects, the American instructors would stop teaching, saying that they did not need to learn further. All the repair work had to be done by the few Americans who accompanied the ships. When the Americans were repairing, they would impose "martial law," forbidding any Chinese from "observing." Some of the ship parts had to be ordered from the United States, and even the heavy oil used on the ships had to be bought from the United States, or they would not be able to operate.

    The "Taiping," the largest cruiser in the fleet, damaged its bow when it arrived at Xiaguan in Nanjing. As a result, it could not be used again without major repairs. Some said the damage was caused by the rapid current and hitting a reef. But Nanjing citizens said that a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship passed by that day, and the collision between the two ships damaged the bow of the "Taiping." The authorities are still keeping it secret and dare not announce it.

    This time, the official newspapers heavily publicized the fleet's return, saying it was to build a new navy. Some sailors shook their heads upon hearing this, saying that it was not even as good as the ships the United States used to test atomic bombs at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific.

    At a press conference reporting on the Kuomintang government's military situation, a military observer mentioned the air force and the army, but not the navy. A reporter curiously asked: "Why not include the navy?" The observer replied wittily: "The government's navy can only rob and search on land. Once it goes into the water, it doesn't even have water to drink, so it's not capable of combat. If you want to include the navy, it would only be the U.S. Marine Corps."

### “玩具舰队”的厄运

　　“玩具舰队”的厄运
    上海通讯
    从美国接收回来的“玩具舰队”国民党政府叫做“新舰队”，在南京一搁就是两个月，一直到九月中旬，才有三艘调到江阴一带“巡逻”。这当中，除了退役纠纷外，据了解内幕者说还有“美式装备”的问题。“新舰队”的舰只连饮食器皿在内，没有问题都是“美式装备”的，然而糟就糟在这里，舰只一离开了美国，什么都发生问题。首先是水的问题，在美国码头上有完全的自来水设备，军舰装水很方便，到了中国有这类设备的港埠是太少了，舰身又太小，没有滤水器的设置，江里的水泥沙太多，不能饮用，舰队到了南京，“美式装备”既失去作用，只好代以原始的中国人力，每天硬是派人到岸上去挑水。
    吃饭跟吃水一样困难，在美国吃的是西餐，到中国改吃中餐，但烤面包的架子不能烧猪肉，装牛奶的冰箱装不了乱七八糟的中菜，连碗筷也得另买。舰身太小，安大锅烧饭的地方也没有。有一次买了几十斤猪肉，冰箱放不下，都发臭了。
    最伤脑筋的是舰船的修理和消耗问题，舰上人员从美国学到了一些驾驶技能，但修理技术美国人却不肯传授。学习期中，往往碰到一些较深的技术学业，美国教官即不教了，说是你们不必学下去。一切的修理工作就只好由随舰的几个美国人负责。美国人修理的时候，他们实行“戒严”，不准任何中国人“参观”。舰上的一些零件都是向美国去配，连舰上用的重油也得经常从美国买来，不然就开不动。
    舰队中吨位最大的巡洋舰“太平”号，去南京刚驶到下关，舰首便碰坏了，结果非大加修理不能再用。碰坏的原因，有的说是因水流湍急，触了礁；但南京市民传说，那一天有招商局的轮船经过，两船相碰，才把“太平”舰的头碰坏了。官方至今仍保守秘密，不敢宣布。
    这次舰队返国，官方报纸上大肆宣传，说什么建设新海军。有些水兵听了直摇头，他们说，连美国在太平洋比基尼岛用以试验原子弹的军舰也不如。
    某军事观察家在一次新闻记者招待会上，报告国民党政府军事情况时，空军陆军都提到了，偏偏没提到海军。某记者好奇的问：“为什么不把海军算在里面呢？”这位观察家回答得很妙：“政府的海军只好在陆地上打打劫，搜搜东西，一下了水，连水都没得喝，那里够得上作战。如果要把海军算在内，那只有美国的海军陆战队了。”
