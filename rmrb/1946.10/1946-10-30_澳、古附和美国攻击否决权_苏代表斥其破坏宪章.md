Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Reports from various sources indicate that the United Nations General Assembly Steering Committee met on the 25th to specifically discuss whether the issue of veto power should be included on the Assembly's agenda. Soviet representative Vyshinsky spoke first, requesting that the Steering Committee remove the suggestion to discuss this item. Vyshinsky pointed out: "The principle of unanimity is the foundation of the United Nations organization. The Soviet Union believes that discussing this issue will inflict a great blow to this young organization, which bears the heavy responsibility of maintaining peace among all nations. In the spirit of solidarity, the Soviet Union will ask other representatives to join in jointly proposing that the discussion of the veto power item be removed from the agenda." British Attorney General Shawcross spoke next, largely agreeing with Vyshinsky's opinion and believing that now is not the time to discuss issues in the Charter regarding the use of veto power. "Modifying the Charter is still too early." Shawcross reviewed the past use of the veto power in the Security Council, while also not advocating preventing discussion of this issue. Subsequently, representatives from Australia, the United States, Cuba, and others spoke in succession, disagreeing with the Soviet Union's suggestion. Vyshinsky then withdrew the suggestion to remove the veto power discussion from the Assembly's agenda, but Vyshinsky denounced the proposals from Australia and Cuba as "issues that shake the foundation of the United Nations." He said: "Article 27 of the Charter clearly explains the right of unanimity, and the proposals now put forward are jeopardizing this unanimity. The Soviet Union believes that it would be more useful to know the purposes of Cuba and Australia. All those who include this item on the Assembly's agenda are facing a very dangerous task, because this is a political attack on the fundamental principles of the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: New York Dispatch: On the second and third days of the United Nations General Assembly (the 24th and 25th), representatives from the United Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, Brazil, Peru, India, Argentina, and Venezuela all delivered speeches in succession. Some American followers attacked the veto power. This attack began with the suggestions from Cuba and Australia, which were later revised by the Philippines and now have the support of representatives from Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Peru. Besides the "chorus" on the veto power issue, what is particularly noteworthy is the formation of a Latin American group led by the representative of Argentina, which retains a fascist regime. It is reported that the purpose of this group's formation is "to gain a more powerful voice for its political propositions in the United Nations General Assembly." For the establishment of this group, Argentina convened a meeting of representatives from twenty Central and South American countries over the weekend to discuss everything. It is generally believed that some Central and South American countries, as followers of the United States, will play out some tricks under the direction of the United States, which is worthy of serious attention.

　　澳、古附和美国攻击否决权
    苏代表斥其破坏宪章
    【新华社延安二十七日电】各方报导：联合国大会指导委员会于二十五日集会，专门讨论否决权问题是否应列入大会议程，苏代表维辛斯基首先发言，要求指委会删除讨论此项问题的建议。维辛斯基指出：“全体一致的原则，是联合国组织的基础，苏联认为这个问题之被讨论，将予此种年轻但负有维系全体国家和平重任的组织以极大的打击。苏联根据团结的精神，将要求其他代表参加共同提议讨论否决权一项应从日程上删掉。”英国检察长萧克罗斯继起发言，他颇同意维辛斯基的意见，并认为现在不是讨论宪章中关于使用否决权之类问题的时候，“修改宪章这个问题尚属太早”。萧氏对过去安理会使用否决权有所检讨，同时也不主张阻止关于这一问题的讨论。此后澳洲、美国、古巴等代表相继发言，不同意苏联的建议。维辛斯基遂收回从大会日程上取消否决权讨论之建议，但维氏指斥澳洲、古巴的这一提案“是动摇联合国基础的问题”，他说：“宪章第二十七条十分明白地说明了一致之权，而现在所提出来的建议是危害这种一致性的，苏联认为要能知道古巴与澳洲的目的是什么，那将更有用处，所有那些将此项议题列入大会日程上的人，都使他们自己面临着一个非常危险的任务，因为这是对联合国基本原则的政治攻击。”
    【新华社延安二十七日电】纽约讯：联合国大会的第二日与第三日（二十四与二十五日）英国、墨西哥、比利时、巴西、秘鲁、印度、阿根廷与委内瑞拉等国代表，均相继发表演说，其中某些美国的跟随者则对否决权加以攻击，这次攻击开始于古巴与澳洲的建议，其后有菲律滨的修正办法，现在又得到阿根廷、墨西哥、巴西与秘鲁等国代表的附和。除了关于否决权问题的“合唱”以外，尤其值得注意的是以保有法西斯政权的阿根廷代表为首的中南美集团的组成。据悉：这一集团组成的目的，是“使其在联合国大会上之政治主张获得更强有力之发言地位”。为这一集团的建立，阿根廷已于周末召开了中南美二十个国家的代表会议，讨论一切，一般认为作为美国跟随者的中南美若干国家，在美国导演之下将玩出一些什么把戏，实堪重视。
