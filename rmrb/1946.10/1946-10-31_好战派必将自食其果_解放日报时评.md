Liberation Daily Commentary

We have pointed out many times that Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" gestures are a smokescreen for him to continue and expand the civil war. In the past, many people couldn't see this truth clearly, but recently, the Chiang army's new offensives against the Liberated Areas, especially the occupation of Andong City, have greatly helped these people recognize this truth.

Chiang Kai-shek once sent representatives to urge the representatives of the Third Party to Nanjing for talks, but when these representatives arrived in Nanjing at his invitation, Chiang Kai-shek himself hid in Taiwan. At the same time, he ordered Chen Cheng to hold a military conference in Peiping, announcing that "the military solution will be completed within three to five months." This was followed by the attack on Lianshui and the occupation of Andong City. …On the one hand, he lured all parties to negotiate, and on the other hand, he fought harder and harder. This approach simply lacks any sincerity. Its extreme hypocrisy is rare in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad! This approach is clearly a serious blow to the efforts of third parties to restore peace talks.

The Chiang army's occupation of Andong City also proves that Chiang's claim to recognize "established facts" is just taking an inch and wanting a mile, not giving up until the democratic forces in China are completely wiped out. After occupying Andong City, the Kuomintang authorities not only showed no remorse, but also defended this crime and created excuses for continuous offensives. Sun Ke, speaking on behalf of the Kuomintang authorities, even said that "the government has the right to take over Andong." From this, it can be seen that whoever recognizes this "established fact" that violates the ceasefire order and policy resolution is actually encouraging Chiang Kai-shek to attack the Chinese people endlessly.

The Kuomintang authorities' "peace offensive," on the one hand, shows their hypocrisy and insidiousness, and on the other hand, reflects the strength of the Chinese people. Precisely because the Chinese people's strength is unprecedentedly strong and their level of awareness is unprecedentedly high, Chiang Kai-shek knows that force alone cannot solve the problem, so he has to release a layer of "peace" smokescreen to cover up his new military offensives and shirk his responsibility for the full-scale civil war. However, we want to warn Chiang Kai-shek: this hypocritical means cannot deceive the Chinese people, especially the people of the Liberated Areas. Zhangjiakou, Huaiyin, Andong City, and other cities were won by the soldiers and civilians of the Liberated Areas from the Japanese invaders with blood and flesh. These cities have undergone brilliant construction under the leadership of the democratic government. The reactionaries can never escape the extremely serious consequences of invading and destroying these cities!

The Chiang army occupied Huaiyin City at the cost of more than 5,000 casualties, and was soon annihilated by more than 7,000 in the Battle of Lianshui. Before occupying Andong City, the Chiang army had lost more than 3,000 people in the Liaodong area in the past month. In the future, the Chiang army will undoubtedly continue to pay a heavier price. The soldiers and civilians of the entire Liberated Area have full confidence in adhering to the overall resistance. There will be a day when all lost territories and occupied cities will be recovered, and there will be a day when we and our compatriots across the country will settle accounts with the reactionaries for their crimes of civil war and dictatorship!

　　好战派必将自食其果
    解放日报时评
    我们曾经历次指出蒋介石的“和平”姿态，是他继续和扩大内战的烟幕。这一真理，过去还有好些人看不清楚，可是最近以来，蒋军对解放区的新进攻，特别是对安东市的侵占，大大地帮助了这些人认识这个真理。
    蒋介石曾经派遣代表再三敦促第三方面代表到南京商谈，但是当这些代表应邀到了南京之后，蒋介石自己就躲到台湾去，同时令陈诚在北平开军事会议，宣布“三五个月内完成军事解决问题”，接着就是进攻涟水、侵占安东市。……一方面诱请各方商谈，另方面却愈打愈大。这种做法，简直没有丝毫诚意可言，其极端虚伪，实为古今中外所罕见！这种做法，显然是对第三方面人士恢复和平谈判的努力严重的打击。
    蒋军的侵占安东市，又证明蒋方所提的承认“既成事实”的说法，就是得寸进尺，贪得无厌，不把中国民主势力消灭干净，就死不甘心。在侵占安东市以后，国民党当局不但没有悔罪之意，而且为这一罪行辩护，并制造不断进攻的借口。代表国民党当局发言的孙科竟说“政府有权接收安东”。由此可见谁承认了这种违反停战令和政策决议的“既成事实”，实际上就等于鼓励蒋介石无止境地向中国人民进攻。
    国民党当局的“和平攻势”，一方面固然表现了它的虚伪阴险，另方面也反映中国人民力量的强大。正因为中国人民力量空前强大和觉悟程度的空前提高，蒋介石知道单是武力不能解决问题，所以不得不放出一层“和平”的烟幕，以掩护其新的军事进攻，并推卸其全面内战的责任。但是，我们要警告蒋介石：这种虚伪的手段，也是欺骗不了中国人民、特别是解放区人民的，张家口、淮阴、安东市等城，是解放区军民从日寇手中以血肉换来的，这些城市在民主政府领导下进行了光辉的建设，反动派决不能逃避侵占和破坏这些城市的极严重的后果！
    蒋军以五千多人的伤亡侵占了淮阴城，不久在涟水一役又被歼七千余人。在侵占安东市前，一月来蒋军即在辽东地区损失三千余人，今后蒋军无疑的将不断地付出更重大的代价。全解放区军民有充分的信心坚持全面抵抗，必有收复一切失地及被侵占城市之一日，必有和全国同胞清算反动派内战独裁罪行之一日！
