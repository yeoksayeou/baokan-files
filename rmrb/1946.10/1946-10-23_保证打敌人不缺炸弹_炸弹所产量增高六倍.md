　　【Ben Bu Weixian 21st electric】Under the resounding slogans of "Guaranteeing that the troops will be clothed in winter uniforms in time" and "Guaranteeing that the troops will not lack bombs to eliminate the enemy," the Supply Department of the Jinnan Military Region has been working intensively for a month. They have successfully completed ×10,000 sets of cotton clothes and quilts and ×10,000 bombs, which have been transported to a certain place on the front line. Since the department put forward the call to step up production to support the front line on September 1, a warm competition movement has been launched. During the assault period, all employees (including more than 900 female workers) automatically cancelled their Sunday holidays and worked day and night. In addition, production efficiency has been greatly improved. The clothing factory has increased its output by an average of 35 percent compared with the past. Each machine produces an average of five to six sets of cotton clothing per day. Worker Gu Shinan's daily output is 19 sets, an increase of four times compared with the past. In the past, the average daily output of finished products per person in the bomb factory was eight. Now, the average daily output per person in the third bomb factory can reach 14.7, while the second factory can produce up to 20.5. Worker Li Zhi can make 200 boxes of wet hengzi (a type of explosive) every day, Song Jingyao can make 500 dry hengzi every day, and Yuan Kehuan can make 1,100 pull detonator tubes every day, which is equivalent to the work of three people, exceeding any previous record. During the assault period, all staff and cadres also showed a high degree of responsibility and initiative. Comrade Zhu Zaihai, deputy section chief of the storage section of the clothing factory, is a Communist Party member with a weak body. During this assault period, he forgot to eat and sleep, personally bought cotton gins and carried cotton. Comrade Shi Yiju, the political instructor who was disabled by cotton ginning, and comrades Li Ziguo, the director of the institute, and Jiuquan, etc., all worked while sick. At the end of the competition, all employees selected 25 model employees, including Wu Xianzhang, and increased their treatment by one grade as a reward. Everyone was in high spirits and said, "The soldiers will wear warm winter clothes and use newly made bombs to eliminate more enemies." They encouraged each other to continue to work hard and do their best to win the victory of the overall resistance.
