　　Threshing Ground
    Lin Li
    The "first to sow wheat for military families, first to thresh grain for military families" campaign of the people of Jize has caused a sensation in every village. Wu Guanying is the best microcosm of this.
    One autumn night with a crescent moon, the men and women of Wu Guanying gathered in the village office. Village Chief An Xueyin shouted, "We must support the front line and truly give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. We should thresh grain for the military families first. Everyone should organize a task force and finish it in three days if possible." Old hero Ye Wenzhang responded first. In his capacity as the head of the cultivation team, he guaranteed to complete it in two days and challenged Wu Ruxin. His conditions were: to thresh twenty stones of grain a day, to thresh it cleanly, to bundle up the firewood and straw neatly, and to deliver the grain chaff and bran to their homes without eating the military families' food. He asked Wu Ruxin, "Dare you accept the challenge?" Wu Ruxin stamped her foot as if insulted: "Do it! I'll thresh two fields a day, millet in the morning and sorghum in the afternoon, and I guarantee that the whole team will be willing to do it."
    Sister Team Leader Ma Jinzhu was about to speak when Women's Association Director Lianzi's Mother preempted her: "Our women will cut the grain ears, guaranteed to be finished early in the morning!" Children's Corps Leader Zhang Futian discussed loudly with Jinzhu, "Let's have our children's sisters unite and compete with the women, each cutting twenty grain ears, and not eat until we're finished." "Do it, do it!" The Sister Team and Children's Corps members responded enthusiastically.
    The next day, as soon as it dawned, the Children's Corps whistle blew sharply, and the Sister Team rang the bell at the same time. Lianzi's Mother, without even buttoning her clothes, hurried to find the inspection committee members. When she appeared at the edge of the field, Luan Cheng's Mother's team had already cut more than half a stack, because they had gotten up in the middle of the night. The naive Sister Team members, while keeping their eyes glued to the task of cutting the grain ears with their sickles, sang gentle and amiable songs:
    "Communist Party, Mao Zedong,
    We'll never forget your great kindness in our lifetime.
    With you, we have food, clothing, and shelter,
    Without you, the people have no light.
    …………………”
    As the sun slowly rose, the sound of sickles immediately drowned out the singing and laughter. People were focused on "not eating until we're finished" and "striving to be a model of preferential treatment," becoming more tense as the end drew near.
    "Finished..." With a bang, everyone threw down their sickles and stood up, applauding together without even brushing off the grass fluff on their bodies.
    Only Xinrong had half a stack left to cut, and she was so anxious that she was about to cry. Jinzhu immediately ran over and directed everyone: "Come on! Come on! One handful each." At this time, the military family member Lan Zhu's Mother brought a large basket full of dates, forcing them into everyone's hands.
    When the cultivation team members entered the threshing ground, the grain ears spread out by the women were already hot from the sun. These heroes, unwilling to be outdone, were happily replacing the livestock in pulling the stone rollers to save livestock power for planting more wheat.
    Before long, the village seemed to be shrouded in a yellow wind, and the grain chaff floated lightly in the sky. They passed the grain chaff again and again, then collected it back, afraid that a single grain would fly away in the wind. The care they took in their work, who could say they were working for someone else?
    It was almost finished, and the silver-haired military family member Dongxi's Mother, holding an oil and salt brush in one hand and a bean bun in the other, pleaded earnestly: "Eat! Eat! When Dongxi and his three brothers were at home, I didn't even have land. After they joined the army, I not only got land, but I didn't even have to lift a finger. From sowing to harvesting, it was all thanks to the labor of our fellow villagers. If you don't eat a single bite, how can this old woman's heart be at peace?"
    The two days of the task force passed, and the military families' grain and grass were properly arranged in their homes. Jin Hai's Mother, who used to beg for food, threshed three stones and four dou of sorghum, and one large stone of millet, and was also able to harvest two hundred catties of cotton. The village lent her thirty catties of wheat seed and helped her plant eight mu of wheat. She had become prosperous.
    On the third day, many of the military families' women also went to the field to cut grain ears for everyone. They said, "We're just having you labor for us, we really feel bad about it. We tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep, not knowing how to repay everyone. We wanted to send a letter to our son, telling him to fight well, but we still felt bad, so we came to cut grain ears for others."

　　打场
    林里
    鸡泽人民“先给军属种麦，先给军属打潮的运动，轰动了每一个村庄，吴官营是最好的缩影。
    一个秋风吹着弯月的夜里，吴官营的男男女女，集合在村公所里，村长安雪寅喊着：“我们要支援前线，切实优抗，我们应该先给军属打场，大家要组织突击，最好三天打完。”老英雄叶文章首先响应，他以代耕团长的资格，保证两天完成，并和吴如心组挑战。他的条件是：一天能打二十石粮，要打干净，柴草捆好垛好，谷秕糠送到家里，不吃军属的饭，他问吴如心：“敢不敢应战？”吴如心像是受到侮辱似的把脚一跺：“干！我一天打两场，上午谷子，下午高粱，还保证全组自愿。”
    姐妹团团长马金珠，正要说话却被妇会主任莲子娘抢了先：“俺妇女削谷穗，保证一早削完！”儿童团长张福田，大声和金珠商量着：“咱们儿童姐妹联合起来，跟妇女竞赛，每人削二十个谷个，削不完不吃饭。”“干，干”，姊妹团、儿童团团员们：一片热烈的响应声。
    次日，天刚发亮，儿童团的哨子吱吱响，姐妹团也同时撞了钟，莲子娘连衣襟也没扣好，就匆匆忙忙的去找检查委员们，当她出现在场边时，銮成娘组已削了多半垛，原来她们半夜就起来了。天真的姐妹团员，一边眼不离手的握着镰刀削谷穗，一边发出温柔可亲的歌声：
    “共产党，毛泽东，
    一辈子忘不了你好恩情。
    有你就有衣食住，
    没你人民没光明。
    …………………”
    太阳徐徐升起，嗽嗽的镰刀声立时淹没了歌笑，人们都聚精于“削不完不吃饭”“争取做个优抗模范头一名”，越到临结尾，越是紧张。
    “完了……”轰的一声，都扔下镰刀站起来，没有打除身上的草絮，就一齐鼓起掌来。
    惟有新荣，还剩下半个没削完，她急得要哭了，金珠马上跑去指挥着大家：“来！来！一人一把。”这时，军属篮柱娘提来满满一大蓝枣，硬往大家手里塞。
    当代耕团员进到谷场时，妇女们摊平的谷穗，早晒得热腾腾的了，这伙不甘落后的英雄们，为节省出牲口力多种麦子，他们愉快的代替着牲口拉磙子。
    不多时，村庄像被一阵黄风所笼罩，谷糠轻松的漂游在天空。他们一遍又一遍的把谷糠扬过去，又收回来，恐怕一粒粮食随风飞跑，他们做活那个细心劲，谁能说他们是给别人做活的呢？
    快完了，军属银发苍苍的东喜娘，一手拿着油盐刷子，一手提着豆包，她苦口劝说着：“吃吧！吃吧！东喜他兄弟三个在家时，我还没有地，他们参军走了，我不光有了地，一点劲没费，从耩到收，都是劳动咱乡亲们，要一嘴不吃，我老婆子的心可怎能下得去呢？”
    突击的两天过去了，军属的粮草都妥妥贴贴安排在家里。过去要饭吃的金海娘，打了三石四斗高粱，一大石谷子，还能收二百斤棉花，村里借给她三十斤麦种，又替她种了八亩麦子，她富起来了。
    第三天，有许多军属的妇女，也都上场给大家削谷穗了，他们说：“俺光劳动你，真是过意不去呀，一夜俺翻来覆去睡不着，不知道该怎么报答大家，俺想给俺儿子捎个信，叫他好好打仗，心里还过意不去，也来替别人削削谷子吧。”
