　　The Road to Rebirth
　　Visiting Four Former Yan Army Officers Participating in Work in the Liberated Area
　　Rong Yinong

Mr. Zhai Dachang (Major General Staff Officer of the Second War Zone Command), Mr. Dai Shuzhang (Chief of Staff of the 19th Army), Mr. Zhang Xizhu (Speaker of the 49th Division), and Mr. Zhang Xiangguo (Director of Politics of the 49th Division), former senior officers of the Yan Army who laid down their arms during the Shangdang Campaign last year, have found a correct path after a year of free study and personal experience in the Liberated Area, in the Senior Counselors' Office of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. They firmly requested to stay in the Liberated Area and participate in the work of the Liberated Area.

When they laid down their weapons and first came to the Liberated Area, they held various different feelings. Some were terrified in their thinking because they believed the vicious rumors of the reactionary leader Yan Xishan and prepared for death; for example, Mr. Zhai Dachang, who had served as the head of the Enemy Work Group, Yan Xishan's most core secret service organization. They all harbored the same uneasy feelings and suspicious eyes. After Mr. Zhai came to the Liberated Area, he paid special attention to every word and deed of every ordinary person. At first, he asked an ordinary person in Tunliu, and that person simply told him about the democratic life of the Liberated Area. At that time, he still suspected that person was a cadre in disguise, intentionally doing propaganda for him. Later, he continued to ask many ordinary people in Tunliu, Changzi and other places, and he realized that the Liberated Area was really free, democratic and happy beyond their imagination. Therefore, he began to see through Yan Xishan's deceptive propaganda. He said to the officers who laid down their weapons with great surprise:

　　"Look, they are fighting counter-mopping-up operations every day, but the crops are still growing so well!"

Along the way, they received warm hospitality from the military and civilians in the Liberated Area. When they arrived at the Senior Counselors' Office of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, they received the treatment of senior cadres, and their lives were very comfortable; the food was very good, and they were constantly given meat. Daily necessities such as soap, towels, and cigarettes were supplied on time. Even before ordinary cadres received their clothes, they were given theirs first, and they were made very exquisitely. Every morning, they were free to exercise and do boxing. After breakfast, they were free to read books and newspapers, and they had a free discussion once a week. When they were tired, they could take a walk or play chess at will to relax. In Yan Xishan's army, they were not allowed to read books and newspapers at will, but here they could read whatever they wanted. The books they asked the Senior Counselors' Office to find were also found for them. Every afternoon, they were free to visit some famous historical sites and factories. They could also watch a play once a week. When they were sick, doctors enthusiastically treated them and gave them special good sick meals, and they were given special preferential treatment in all aspects. Once, Mr. Li Zhou, a major general staff officer among them, fell ill in the middle of the night, and the military region's doctors visited him several times that night. Mr. Zhai Dachang was moved: "The Communists are all saints, all disciples of Mozi, truly practicing universal love. If we were sick in the Second War Zone, let alone automatically coming to see us several times, even if we asked them to come, they would not even come once, and would never come again." According to Mr. Dai Shuzhang: Comrades from top to bottom in the military region were very sincere and kind to them, and did not treat them as outsiders. They unanimously believed that their food, clothing and housing in the military region were much better than in the Jin-Sui Army. Mr. Zhang Xizhu pointed out more simply and clearly: "Although the Jin-Sui Army is nominally a salary system, after their discounts, it is not even enough to cover food."

At this point, they recalled the comparison between the two armies and the two societies in China. Mr. Dai Shuzhang was a student of the 12th class of the Whampoa Military Academy. After graduating, he served as a platoon leader in the 61st Independent Division of the Chiang Army, and then as a company commander in the supplementary regiment of the division. The battalion commander wanted to take ten empty names from his company, but he was upright and refused the battalion commander's request. As a result, the battalion commander used the excuse that he was not courteous enough on the playground, slapped him in the face, and after an argument, he left the Chiang Army in early October of the 27th year and transferred to work in the 19th Army of the Yan Army. He recalled that there were deep contradictions in the internal structure of the Chiang Army, such as regionalism, factionalism, and feudal relationships. Coupled with secret service rule, they competed for power and profit, and fought each other with deceit. Everyone wore a false mask, flattering and accommodating each other, and the vast majority of people did not dare to tell the truth. Especially those who were pure, strong, and serious were not popular. Therefore, many people in the Chiang Army felt darkness and depravity. Yan Xishan has always tried to survive in contradictions. If there were no contradictions, he would create contradictions, fearing that military cadres were unreliable, so he made cadres supervise each other, and sent a political director to supervise military cadres. Fearing that the military and political systems would collude, he sent a "Construction Committee" to concurrently manage military and political affairs. Fearing that the army would spend too much of his money, he sent a managing director, as well as additional workers, and organized political guard groups, iron army group service rooms, and other open and secret service organizations to find faults and create problems in the troops and report to superiors. For some small problems, he would ask cadres to "commit suicide." Liu Yongzhi, the former commander of the 70th Division, was ordered to "commit suicide" by Yan Xishan for a small matter and died. Therefore, working in Yan Xishan's place was the most painful. Mr. Zhai Dachang further pointed out: "The secret agents created problems and killed so many people unjustly, which led to a situation in the Yan Army where everyone was in danger and suffered unspeakable misery. Yan Xishan used 'soldier-farmer unity,' 'soldier-merchant unity,' and 'soldier-worker unity' to concentrate all the land and capital of Shanxi in his own hands through the village government, conscripting young men to maintain his reactionary rule and interests." Mr. Zhai said: "The people recognized who Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan were enlisting soldiers for, especially since he wanted to rely on the United States. The people were unwilling to fight a civil war for the traitorous reactionaries, sell their lives, and slaughter their compatriots. Therefore, their morale was very low, and when they fought, they either ran away home or laid down their weapons and came over." Mr. Zhang Xizhu believed that Yan Xishan's implementation of "soldier-farmer unity" only accelerated its collapse!

As for talking about the Liberated Area and the Eighth Route Army, they believed that not only were the military and civilians like one family, and the military and government helped each other, and officers and soldiers were united, but especially that "those who till the land own it" was realized. Mr. Zhang Xiangguo believed that this was a liquidation of the pain that landlords had inflicted on the people for thousands of years, and that the land was returned to the people according to the needs of the people. And the lives of landlords were given appropriate care. This solved the big problem of Chinese society for thousands of years, increased production, and made everyone have land to cultivate, food to eat, and work to do. This made the strength of the people built on a permanent and invincible solid foundation. The people opposed the traitorous civil war to protect their own interests and the country, so the Liberated Area became stronger and stronger, and the troops became more and more numerous. Several gentlemen said in unison: Because the Liberated Area implemented "those who till the land own it," there were no unrighteous rich landlords, no destitute poor people, and no beggars, thieves, or bandits, and the ideal society of "doors not locked at night and things not picked up from the road" that China has had since ancient times was realized.

They compared the two armies and the two societies and connected them to the trend of the world. They clearly recognized that only the Chinese Communist Party could save the suffering Chinese people and make China achieve independence, peace, democracy and happiness. Their participation in the construction work of the Liberated Area meant that they had embarked on a new path of life.

　　新生之路
    访问参加解放区工作的前阎军四军官
    荣一农
    去年上党战役放下武器的阎军高级军官翟大昌（二战区长官部少将参事）、戴树樟（十九军参谋处长）、张西柱（四十九师参议长）、张香国（四十九师政治主任）等先生，经过一年来，在解放区，在晋冀鲁豫军区高级参议室自由学习和亲身的体验，找到了一条正确的道路，他们坚决要求留在解放区，参加解放区的工作。
    当他们放下武器，初来解放区的时候，都曾抱着各种不同的心情，有的因为相信了反动头子阎锡山恶毒的造谣，因此思想上很恐慌，准备了死；例如曾当过阎锡山最核心的特务组织敌工团团长的翟大昌先生就是如此。他们都怀着相同的惴惴不安的心情和怀疑的目光。翟先生来解放区后特别注意到每一个老百姓的一言一动，最初他在屯留问了一个老百姓，那个老百姓就把解放区的民主生活简单告他说了，那时他还怀疑那个人是干部化装的，有意向他作宣传，后来他继续在屯留、长子等地问了很多老百姓，才知道解放区真是他们没有想象到的自由、民主和幸福。因此，他开始识破了阎锡山的欺骗宣传，他很惊奇的对一同放下武器的军官们说：
    “你们看，人家天天反扫荡，田禾还长得这样好！”
    沿路他们受到解放区军民热情的招待，及至到了晋冀鲁豫军区高参室，他们受到高级干部的待遇，生活很优裕；饮食很好，不断的有肉吃。日常的肥皂、手巾、纸烟………都按时供给，一般干部的衣服还未发下时，就先给他们发下，作的还很精致。每天早晨他们自由运动、打拳。早饭后，自由阅读书报，每周自由讨论一次，倦了就随便散散步、下下象棋……作为消遣。在阎锡山军队中，不准他们随便阅读书报，而在这里可以随便阅读，他们托高参室找的书籍，也都是他们找到。每天下午，他们可以自由到一些名胜古迹和工厂去游览参观。每周尚可看一次戏。他们病了，医生热情的给他们疗治，给他们作特别好的病号饭，各方面都予以特别优待。有一次他们中的少将参事李周半夜病了，军区的医生连夜给他看了几次，翟大昌先生感动了：“共产党都是圣人，都是墨家的徒弟，真正作到了天下兼爱。若是在二战区我们病了，不要说自动的一连来给看几次，就是我们去请，也不过来应付一次，回去就再不来了。”据戴树樟先生说：军区自上而下的同志们都是对他们都很诚恳亲切，不把他们当外人看待。他们一致的认为：他们在军区的衣食住都比在晋绥军强的多。张西柱先生更简捷明了的指出：“晋绥军名义上虽是薪水制，经过他们的七折八扣，扣下来，光吃的都不够。”
    至此，他们回忆到中国两种军队两种社会的比较。戴树樟先生是黄埔十二期学生，毕业后，就在蒋军独立第六十一师任排长，继又在该师补充团任连长。营长要在他连里吃十个空名子，他性情直正，拒绝了营长的要求。结果营长借故他在操场上礼节不周，打了他一耳光，吵了一顿，二十七年十月初他就脱离了蒋军，转到阎军第十九军里工作。他回忆到蒋军的内部有地区、派系、封建关系等深刻的矛盾。加以特务统治，互相间争权夺利，勾心斗角，人人挂着一付假面具，阿谀逢迎，互相应付，绝大多数人不敢说真理，特别纯洁，刚强、认真干的人吃不开。因此许多人在蒋军里边都感到暗无天日而苦恼堕落下去。阎锡山则是一向企图在矛盾中求生存。没有矛盾，他造矛盾，恐怕军事干部不可靠使干部互相监视，派一个政治主任监视军事干部。又怕军、政两系同流，再派一个“建委”兼管军政。还怕军队多用了他的钱，又派一个经管主任，以及加派工作员，组织政卫团，铁军组服务室等等公开的与不公开的特务组织，在部队里找毛病，制造问题，向上级报告。有一些小问题，就叫干部实行“自裁”。前七十师师长刘墉之就因为一点小事，被阎锡山命中“自裁”而死了。所以在阎锡山那里工作最痛苦。翟大昌先生进而指出：“特务们制造了问题，不知屈死了多少人，由此形成阎军内部人人自危，苦不堪言。阎锡山以‘兵农合一’、‘兵商合一’、‘兵工合一’，经过村政权把全山西的土地和资本都集中到他一人手里，抽编青壮丁，维护他那反动的统治和利益”。翟先生说：“人民是认识了其蒋介石、阎锡山当兵，是给谁打天下，特别他要靠美国，人民是不愿意给卖国贼反动派打内战，出卖自己的生命，来屠杀自己的同胞。所以他们的士气很低落，一打不是跑散回家，就是放下武器过来。”张西柱先生认为：阎锡山实行“兵农合一”，只是加速它的崩溃！
    至于谈到解放区和八路军，他们认为不仅军民一家，军政相助，官兵一致，特别是实现了“耕者有其田”。张香国先生认为这是清算了几千年来地主给予人民的痛苦，根据人民的需要，把土地还给了人民。而对地主的生活，又给以适当照顾。这就解决了几千年来中国社会的大问题，提高了生产，使人人有地种、有饭吃、有工作。这样就使人民的力量建立在永久不败的雄厚基础上。人民反对卖国内战是为了保护自卫的利益和国家而战，所以解放区越打越壮，部队越打也越多。他们几位先生都异口同声的说：由于解放区实行了“耕者有其田”的结果，没有了为富不仁的地主，亦没有了赤贫的穷人，更没有乞丐、小偷、土匪，而实现了中国自古以来“夜不闭户、路不拾遗”的理想社会。
    他们从两种军队和两种社会的对比又连系到世界潮流的趋势，清楚的认识到；只有中国共产党才能救出苦难的中国人民，使中国求得独立、和平、民主与幸福。他们参加了解放区的建设工作，也就是他们走上了新生的道路。
