　　Military Region Communications Bureau No. 3 Intensifies Production and Enthusiastically Supports the Troops
    [Our Newspaper, Handan News] Under the slogan of striving for complete victory in the War of Resistance, all comrades of Communications Bureau No. 3 actively donated money, reaching 97,700 yuan, to慰劳 the soldiers on the front lines. According to a responsible comrade from Bureau No. 3: "The comrades in the Third Section should have been慰劳ed themselves. For example, under the leadership of Comrade Qin Dasu, the battery factory's production volume has increased threefold compared to the previous two months, and everyone has been working very energetically!" The workers unanimously stated in their conversations: "The soldiers on the front lines are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves. We in the rear should sweat more, work overtime, and慰劳 the front lines. This is very appropriate, because we must strive for complete victory in the War of Resistance."

　　军区通讯三局紧张生产热烈劳军
    【本报邯郸讯】在争取全面抵抗胜利的口号下，通讯三局，全体同志踊跃募捐，收达九万七千七百元，慰劳前线将士。据三局某负责同志谈：“三处的同志们本来是应该被慰劳的，如电池工厂在秦大苏同志领导下，生产量比前两月提高了三倍，且大家的工作始终很起劲！”工人同志们的谈话中，一致认为：“前线将士流血牺牲，我们在后方多流些汗，赶夜工，慰劳前线都是很应该的，因为我们要争取全面抵抗的胜利。”
