　　Cixian County Five Thousand People's Representatives Gathered
    Commemorate the Revolutionary Martyr Tang Shoushan
    Congealed into a Great Force to Fight Back Against Chiang's Army and Defend Emancipation
    [Report from this newspaper, Cixian] On September 22nd, Cixian County held a grand memorial meeting for revolutionary leader Tang Shoushan and other martyrs, and a mobilization rally for the patriotic self-defense war. Attendees included County Head Wu, Comrade Wang Ping representing the Cixian County Committee of the Communist Party, veteran party members from across the county, former Red mass members of the peasant associations, and over five thousand representatives of recently emancipated masses. At the meeting, veteran revolutionary comrades Chen Guoqiang and Li Juchuan reported on the glorious struggle history of Comrade Tang Shoushan. In the spring of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Comrade Shoushan led the masses of more than ten villages including Dongxi Guanglu and Qugou in a struggle against the apportionment of taxes, settling accounts with landlords and achieving a great victory in canceling excessive burdens. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he led the masses of Gancaoying in a struggle against corruption, settling accounts with ten major households. Under the suppression of the military police, an armed uprising was held, disarming the landlords' militia. In the autumn of the same year, due to poor harvests and excessive taxes and levies, the poor were unable to survive. Comrade Shoushan called on the peasants to borrow grain from the landlords and achieved victory, a movement that spread to more than thirty villages with great momentum, saving countless disaster victims on the verge of starvation. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Shoushan organized armed forces in Guanglu, constantly attacking the enemy, and was soon murdered by the heinous reactionary landlord Tang Laobu of Fanyao. When everyone heard about the tragic scene of Comrade Shoushan being buried alive, they could no longer bear it, and all wept in grief, shouting slogans such as "He died for the emancipation of the common people!" "What he said and did has all come true today!" "All old and new party members, old and new cadres, the broad masses, and all peasants of Cixian County, unite, learn from Comrade Tang Shoushan's revolutionary spirit, and fight to the end!" When it was mentioned that Chiang Kai-shek was concentrating all his efforts to launch a large-scale attack on our liberated areas, the entire audience roared: "Fight to the end with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and reactionary faction!" After the meeting, a parade and demonstration was held. A sacrifice was also made at the martyrs' graves, and Tang Laobu, the culprit in the brutal murder of Comrade Tang Shoushan and others, was executed by firing squad amidst violent cries of "Revenge!" Through this meeting, everyone's understanding of fighting back against Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and defending their emancipated fruits became clearer, and the idea of common hatred for the enemy had solidified into a force.

　　磁县五千群众代表集会
    纪念翻身先烈唐寿山
    凝结成一个伟大力量为打退蒋军保卫翻身而斗争
    【本报磁县讯】九月廿二日，磁县召开隆重的纪念革命领袖唐寿山等先烈及爱国自卫战争动员大会，到会者有武县长、中共县委代表王平同志，全县老党员、过去农民协会的赤色群众及最近翻身群众代表五千余人。大会由老革命同志陈国强、李巨川报告唐寿山同志的光荣斗争史迹。寿山同志在民国十八年春天就领导东西光禄、曲沟等十余村群众的反摊派斗争，与地主清算账目，获得取消负担过重的大胜利。民国十九年，领导甘草营群众进行反贪污斗争，清算十大户的账目。在军警镇压下举行了武装暴动，解除了地主的民团武装。同年秋天，因年景不好，苛捐杂税太重，逼得穷人不能活，寿山同志号召农民向地主借粮取得胜利，运动普及卅余村，声势浩大，救活了无数快要饿死的灾难民。抗战开始，寿山同志在光禄组织武装，曾不断打击敌人，不久即被万恶的范窑反动大地主唐老步害死。大家听到寿山同志被活埋的惨景时，再也忍耐不住了，莫不悲痛落泪，高呼着“他是为老百姓翻身死的！”“他说的话和办的事情，今天都实现了！”“全磁县的新旧党员，新老干部，广大群众，全体农民团结起来，学习唐寿山同志的革命精神，斗争到底”的口号。当提到蒋介石正集中全力向我解放区大举进攻时，全场怒吼：“和蒋介石卖国反动派斗争到底！”会后举行游行示威。并至烈士坟前行祭，惨杀唐寿山等同志的罪魁唐老步在暴烈的“复仇”声中执行枪决。经过这次大会，大家对打退蒋介石进攻，保卫自己的翻身的果实的思想更加明确了，同仇敌忾的思想，已经凝结成一个力量。（柴荣先）
