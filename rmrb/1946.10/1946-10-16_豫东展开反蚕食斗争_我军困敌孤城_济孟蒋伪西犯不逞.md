　　Eastern Henan Launches Counter-Encirclement Struggle
    Our Army Traps Enemy in Isolated Cities
    Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Troops Fail in Western Advance in Ji-Meng Area
    [Report from the Eastern Henan Front, 14th] In the areas of Qi County, Sui County, Feng County, and Dangshan County in Eastern Henan, our local guerrilla forces and the people's militia have universally launched a counter-encirclement struggle, trapping the stubborn puppet troops in several isolated cities. On the 25th, 26th, and 28th of last month, we successively repelled Chiang's troops who were invading Kongzhuang (northwest of Qi County), Heyangji (southeast of Sui County), Luozhuang (north of Dangshan), and Liu Anlou, southwest of Feng County. A total of 34 Chiang's soldiers were killed, more than 20 were wounded, 8 were captured alive, and more than 10 guns, some ammunition, and 2 carts were seized.
    [Report from Yangcheng, 14th] In the Ji (Yuan) Meng (County) area of northern Henan, the stubborn puppet troops are actively invading the liberated area east of Yuqu's Yellow River north bank, attempting to join forces with the Chiang's puppet troops in Yuqu. From the end of last month, with the repeated coordination of three Chiang's planes, they successively launched four attacks on Beichen, Yangzhuang, East and West Yang Village, Guojia Mountain, Guozhuang Ridge (all in the southwest of Jiyuan and northwest of Meng County), but each time they were repelled by our local armed forces and militia. A total of 7 Chiang's puppet soldiers were killed, 23 were killed below the platoon leader level, and some ammunition was seized.
