　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th. According to Moscow Radio, Soviet broadcast observer Ms. Qiao'ernaia commented on the United Nations General Assembly agenda item concerning the investigation of foreign troops stationed on the territory of non-enemy states on the 27th, stating: This issue is one of the pressing international issues that must be resolved in order to establish a solid and lasting peace. She also strongly criticized the United States for actively assisting the Kuomintang with troops, aircraft, and arms, turning China into a battlefield of bloody civil war. Ms. Qiao finally pointed out that the United States' actions of stationing troops extensively in the territory of non-enemy states undermine past treaties and agreements and disregard law and justice. The issue of foreign troops must be resolved, otherwise, postwar peace cannot be established.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. United Press, Tokyo, 25th: MacArthur admitted in a report to headquarters that the relationship between the Philippine people and the U.S. military is constantly deteriorating, forming a tense situation. He also admitted that the Philippine people oppose the establishment of U.S. bases, protest the occupation of property, and resent the arrogance and self-importance of the U.S. military. He said that many Filipinos are dissatisfied with the presence of U.S. troops, especially in Manila, which has led to a significant increase in incidents. However, MacArthur threatened regarding this dissatisfaction: "The Philippine people must answer this question." It is noted that the Filipino people's opposition to American imperialism is evident in their opposition to the U.S.-Philippine base negotiations, which led to the suspension of these negotiations; it is also evident in the passage of the U.S.-Philippine Trade Agreement in the parliament by only a single vote majority.

　　苏广播观察家乔尔娜亚评称
    欲建立巩固持久和平必解决外国驻军问题
    菲律滨人民与美军关系不断恶化
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据莫斯科广播，苏联广播观察家乔尔娜亚女士二十七日评联合国大会议程上关于调查非敌国领土上之外国驻军问题称：这一问题是欲建立巩固与持久和平就非解决不可的国际迫切问题之一。并力斥美国用军队飞机军火等积极帮助国民党，中国已成为流血内战的战场。乔氏最后指出：美国在非敌国领土上遍驻军队的行动，破坏了过去的条约和协定，蔑视法律与正义。外国驻军问题必须解决，否则无法建立战后和平。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】合众社东京二十五日讯：麦克阿瑟于向总部之报告中，承认菲律滨人民与美军之关系不断恶化，已形成一种紧张状态，并承认菲律滨人民反对美国设立基地，抗议占据财产及美军自高自大不可一世。并谓好些菲律滨人不满意美军驻留，尤其是马尼拉更是如此，因此肇事事件大为增加。然麦克阿瑟对此种不满竟威胁地说：“菲律滨人必须对此问题作答”按菲人反对美国帝国主义之情绪，一见于对美菲基地谈判之反对，致使此项谈判不得不中止；再见于美菲通商条约仅以一票之多数在议会通过。
