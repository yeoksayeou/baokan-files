[Report from this newspaper's Weixian Office on the 29th] During the land reform review in the Jinnan area, peasants exposed the cunning landlords' conspiracy of fake land donations. Landlords in Jicun and Wuhu villages in the fourth district of Gucheng County secretly convened meetings after the start of the mass movement, feigning "land donations" to paralyze the masses, maintain their ruling position, and avoid mass struggles. After their "land donation," they spread rumors to intimidate middle peasants into donating land as well, saying, "Everyone averaging more than three mu will be struggled against if they don't donate," thereby trying to win over middle peasants and undermine the unity of the masses. Now, the masses in these two villages, through deliberation and discussion, have recognized the landlords' deceitful faces and have begun to struggle against them. During the land reform review in Yuanchao, feudal landlord Ji Qunxing, local tyrant Ji Mingde, and Zheng Jiaren in Jiazhuang also proposed "land donation" and "grain donation" to ease mass struggle, and constantly fabricated rumors saying, "Whoever has it will be struggled against." This caused anxiety among many middle peasants, and five middle-peasant households also wanted to donate land. After the village cadres discovered these phenomena, they mobilized the masses deeply, proposing "Poor and middle peasants are one family," "Let us unite and eliminate feudal exploitation," exposing the landlords' rumors and the conspiracy of "land donation." The middle peasants were very resentful of the landlords' evil deeds, and the five middle-peasant households stopped talking about donating land. The two households that had sold their cattle bought them back and actively participated in the struggle against local tyrant Ji Mingde and others.

[Report from this newspaper's Wenxian Office] The County Joint Office recently issued a circular, calling on all districts and villages to strictly prevent and expose the unscrupulous schemes of treacherous and tyrannical landlords to deceive leading organs and suppress mass movements with fake struggles. The circular pointed out that as the vigorous land reform struggle of the county's peasants is about to destroy the feudal reactionary rule of treacherous and tyrannical landlords, the rulers' conspiracies and means to obstruct and sabotage the mass movement have become even more despicable. When District × held a joint meeting of village cadres, a major local tyrant in Village ×× immediately sent out his lackeys, using the slogan "Don't let outsiders come to struggle," to deceive some backward masses into carrying out fake struggles. They used this as an excuse to fully staff the "cadre" positions of village head and farmers' association director, claiming to the outside world, "The masses in our village have all turned over!" A major local tyrant stroked his beard and laughed, saying to his lackeys, "Struggle, struggle, you can't escape my palm!" At a struggle meeting self-organized by the ruler Ren ×× in Village ××, the speakers were all his brothers and relatives. They argued as if it were real, even putting on a show of beating each other, but both sides in the struggle occasionally let out mocking laughter. After the meeting, rumors spread saying, "The struggle in Village ×× is really scary, ××× was beaten badly by the masses!" A major landlord's brother in Village × falsely calculated that his brother had 9,000 shi of grain. A local tyrant's henchman in Village × even calculated that the local tyrant had 2 million shi. They used this to promote, "×××'s family fortune is exhausted, not even enough to sweep him out the door!" to deceive cadres and leading organs. The communiqué finally called on cadres in all districts and villages to strictly prevent and expose such fake struggles, and pointed out that in the future, when working in villages, it is necessary to go deep into the poorest and most oppressed masses to carry out mass mobilization, not to hold unprepared meetings, and avoid being taken advantage of by traitors. Resolutely replace the "cadres" arranged by landlords and local tyrants, re-launch the mass struggle, shatter the rulers' shameless conspiracies, and completely eliminate backward villages.

[Report from this newspaper's Handan Office] Zhang Village on the riverside of this county exposed the landlords' conspiracy, replaced bad cadres (henchmen of local tyrant landlords) who suppressed the mass movement, and launched a liquidation movement. After the liberation of this village, a struggle to redeem land and increase capital was carried out. In order to continue to maintain their rule, local tyrant Wang Cheng and others sent their henchmen, pretending to be active, into mass organizations, seizing the leading positions of chairman and vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association and militia captain, suppressing mass struggle, resulting in the movement being extremely depressed in the village. After the land reform team arrived in the village, they deceived them by saying, "There are no bad people, no big landlords, and no poor people in our village, and there is no struggle." On the one hand, they secretly threatened the masses who complained to the land reform team: "Struggle should be reasonable and legal, dare you be responsible if the struggle is chaotic?!" and mobilized the masses to accept Wang Cheng and others' fake "voluntary" land. After the land reform team discovered this problem, they immediately educated the masses to expose their conspiracy, and the masses dismissed the bad elements and elected activists to replace them, and the morale of the masses immediately rose. In mid-September, a fierce struggle was launched against Wang and others, and more than 50 oppressed peasants poured out their grievances. Many people complained that the local tyrant landlord Wang Cheng forced peasants to build a five-story pillbox for him, without paying a penny, and he did not care if the land was barren. The widow Wang Zhou recounted that because she was falsely accused by the local tyrant Wang Fengli, she was forced to file a lawsuit and sold her only 11 mu of land. Her husband died of anger, and her family of four had suffered from hunger and cold for more than ten years. Her pain caused many victims to shed tears of sympathy. The masses liquidated the illegal acts of Wang Cheng, Wang Fengli, and other six local tyrant landlords, such as concealing land, fake mortgages and fake sales, evading burdens, and misappropriating public funds, and recovered the losses. Wang Zhou also recovered the land she had lost thirteen years ago.

　　地主狡施假献田假斗争各地群众予以粉碎打击
    【本报威县二十九日电】冀南区农民在翻身大检查当中，揭发了狡猾地主假献田的阴谋。故城四区激村和五户村地主，在群众运动开始后，便秘密开会，假装“献田”，麻痹群众，以保持其统治地位，避免群众斗争。当他们“献田”以后，便造谣恐吓中农也来献田，说什么“每人平均超出三亩，不献便得挨斗争”，借此拉拢中农，破坏群众的团结。现在该两村群众在酝酿讨论中，认识了地主的鬼脸，并已开始进行斗争。元朝在翻身大检查运动中，纪家庄封建地主纪群兴、恶霸地主纪明德和郑家仁也提出“献田”“献粮”，以缓和群众斗争，还不断胡造谣言说：“谁有就斗谁。”致于许多中农心情不安，有五户中农也要献田。村干部发现这些现象后，便对群众深入动员，提出“中贫农是一家”、“大家团结起来，消灭封建剥削”，揭露了地主的造谣和“献田”的阴谋。中农对地主的这种罪恶行为，十分痛恨，那五户中农也不说献出了，卖牛的两户又买上牛，并都积极参加了反对恶霸地主纪明德等的斗争。
    【本报温县讯】本县联合办公室顷发出通报，号召各区村严密防止并揭破奸霸地主偷梁换柱，以假斗争迷惑领导机关，抑制群众运动的无耻阴谋。通报指出：由于全县农民轰轰烈烈的翻身斗争即将摧毁奸霸地主的封建反动统治，统治者们阻挠破坏群运的阴谋手段也随着更加卑劣。×区召开村干联席会时，××村某大恶霸一听到风声，马上派出走狗，以“不让外村来斗争”为口号，骗了一些落后群众进行假斗争，并借此把村长、农会主任等“干部”都安置齐全，对外声称：“俺村群众都翻身了！”某大恶霸捻须大笑着对其走狗说：“斗争斗争，斗不出我的手心！”××村统治者任××自制的斗争会上，诉苦者均是他的兄弟和亲戚。他们像煞有介事的争吵着，甚至装模作样的打了一顿，但斗争双方均不时发出戏谑的笑声。会后传出风声说：“××村斗得真怕人，×××叫群众打坏啦！”×村大地主的兄弟假意算了他哥哥九千石粮食。×村恶霸的狗腿甚至算出恶霸二百万石。他们借此宣传：“×××的家当算干了，扫地出门也不够了！”以迷惑干部与领导机关。公报最后号召各区村干部严密防止并揭发这种假斗争，并指出今后到村工作，必须深入到最穷苦、最受压迫的群众中去，进行群众大串通，不开无准备的大会，免为奸徒所乘。坚决撤换为地主恶霸安排好的“干部”，重新发动群众斗争，击碎统治者的无耻阴谋，彻底消灭落后村。
    【本报邯郸讯】本县河边张庄揭破地主阴谋，撤换镇压群运的坏干部（恶霸地主狗腿），掀起清算运动。该村解放后，曾进行过赎地增资斗争，恶霸地主王成等为继续维持其统治，派遣狗腿，假装积极，打入群众组织，夺取农会正副主任及民兵队长等领导岗位，镇压群众斗争，致该村运动异常消沉。翻身队到达该村后，彼等即欺骗说：“俺村没有坏人，没有大地主，也没有穷人，斗争不起来”。一面则暗地威胁向翻身队诉苦的群众：“斗争要合理、合法，斗乱了你敢负责！？”并活动群众接受王成等之假“自动”土地。翻身队发现此问题后，立即教育群众揭露其阴谋，并由群众将坏分子撤职，选出积极分子接替，群众情绪顿形高涨。九月中旬，向王等展开猛烈斗争，五十余被压迫农民倾倒了苦水。许多人诉说恶霸地主王成，强迫农民为他修盖五层大炮楼，不给分文代价，荒了地他不管。寡妇王周氏诉说因受恶霸王丰礼诬屈，被迫打官司，卖掉了仅有的十一亩地，丈夫气死了，全家老小四口十多年来饥寒交迫。她的痛苦引得许多苦主洒下同情泪。群众清算了王成、王丰礼等六家恶霸地主的黑瞒地、假当假卖、逃避负担，胡支乱派，贪污中饱等违法行为，并收回了损失。王周氏也收回了十三年前丢掉的土地。
