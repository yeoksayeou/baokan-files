　　The Workers' Movement in Liuhegou
    Zhao Guoqiang

    Since its liberation, Liuhegou has made some achievements in mobilizing the masses to oppose traitors, promote production, improve workers' living standards, lead workers in study and education, and transform organizational structures (union cadres participating in production administration, abolishing the level of division, etc.). However, because the reactionary forces relied upon by the enemy and puppet regimes during their eight-year rule have not been eliminated, the disasters and suffering endured by the masses have not been thoroughly accounted for, evil has not been suppressed, and righteousness has not been promoted. Consequently, the masses have not been fully mobilized. Moreover, some unreasonable systems have not been reformed, still restricting the masses. Therefore, the masses have not realized the difference between the present and the past. Some also want to carry out liquidation, but they are apprehensive, comforting themselves with thoughts such as "don't provoke people," "now we have food to eat," and "let bygones be bygones." Some also complain that we have not helped them. As a result, there are abnormal manifestations in labor attitudes: some are driven to labor by "conscience" because they have enough to eat after liberation; some labor out of fear of "losing their jobs"; some even demand wage increases through slowdowns, attack active elements in production, disobey commands at work, and even engage in theft. All of this demonstrates that the masses have not been fully mobilized, and the suffering of the masses has not been properly addressed. Even if daily education is spoken of well in words, labor attitudes will not fundamentally change, and production enthusiasm will not be improved. Therefore, for better labor-capital cooperation, to launch a great production movement, actively support the front lines, and strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war, Liuhegou has proposed to continue mobilizing the masses and implement the policy of speaking out about grievances and settling accounts.

    The grievance-airing and settlement-of-accounts movement developed rapidly after the victory in the struggle against Zhou Lixuan (a large staff member in the labor department during the enemy era, who used to deduct workers' wages and embezzled company funds after liberation). Problems of grievance-airing and settlement-of-accounts were raised one after another by the masses. Some involved labor staff, factory directors, supervisors, and kiln contractors during the enemy era who oppressed people by relying on enemy power; some involved unreasonable oppression by local bullies, ruffians, despots, and organization personnel, inspectors, interpreters, mine police, and garrison teams; some involved general deductions and exploitation (such as grain and wages). Consequently, in July, Liuhegou launched a mine-wide worker grievance-airing and settlement-of-accounts movement focusing on opposing traitors, opposing local bullies, and old contractors. Now, workers' production enthusiasm and the prestige of the company and the union have greatly increased, proving that things are very different from the past. When the Kuomintang attacked Qugou, the entire workforce actively responded to the company's call, moving machinery and relocating families, completing the task in just three days. The workers' pickets expanded from ninety to three hundred people, guarding day and night.

    The liquidation movement was launched under the joint coordination of the company and the trade union. First, both sides made self-criticisms based on the spirit of labor-capital cooperation and mutual assistance in developing production. The union recognized that it had not given enough consideration to the company's production requirements in the past, and its own work was not in-depth. On the other hand, the company had neglected worker work and simply emphasized production in the past. As a result, both sides reached a consensus: mobilizing the masses to organize production is the common goal of the company and the union. It was then decided that July and August would be dedicated to mass mobilization for grievance-airing and liquidation as the central task for both parties. Meetings of cadres and activists were jointly convened, with the participation of managers, directors, and factory directors from the company and all cadres from the union. They discussed how to mobilize the masses, cleared their minds, and then established four working groups according to the residential areas of the masses and the situation of the production departments. A temporary committee was set up to uniformly command the groups. In the mass struggle, issues concerning the entire mine were initiated by each group in a unified manner, while small departmental issues were resolved by each group separately. Each group had to report regularly so that the committee could understand the situation of each group at any time and provide specific guidance. In the process of mobilizing the masses, attention should be paid to avoid detachment from production and administrative work, to transform the thinking of the masses, and to reform unreasonable old systems. It is necessary to help each other, take care of each other, and respect each other in working attitude, relying on the masses with one heart and one mind. Only in this way can the workers of the entire mine area be truly and fully mobilized. This is a prerequisite for carrying out the movement.

    Secondly, through this grievance-airing and liquidation, we won over the staff and technical workers. In the past, comrades from the company and the union believed that staff and technical workers were difficult to approach and that it was difficult to work with them. Actual experience has shown that when the masses in Liuhegou were mobilized, changes took place among these people. Some with problems were exposed by the masses and reformed, and some voluntarily bowed their heads to the masses and admitted their mistakes. Those who had no problems but had been oppressed also actively participated in the grievance-airing meetings. Many who had unclear thoughts voluntarily sought progress under the influence of the mass movement. Their thinking was transformed and their awareness was raised in large and small grievance-airing and struggle meetings. These illustrate that the essence of the so-called "difficult to approach" and "difficult to work with" is that we have drawn a gulf between ourselves and the masses that has not been bridged. After this movement, the distinction between good and bad people became clear. Some whom we once thought were bad were found to be reformable and educable through the movement. This is also a major gain from this mass mobilization.

    Finally, it should also be pointed out that this movement also resolved the relationship between the mining area and the countryside. They organized a three-person committee of the company, the trade union, and the district political commissar to jointly consult on problems in order to cooperate with each other in laboring masses. However, it should be made clear in the leading ideology that the struggle methods of the countryside cannot be moved to the factory and used indiscriminately, and at the same time, it cannot be completely separated from the mass movement in the countryside and isolated. Only in this way can the relationship between each other be improved.

　　六河沟的职工运动
    赵国强
    六河沟自解放后，在发动群众反奸、生产、改善职工生活、领导职工学习教育及组织机构改造（工会干部参加生产行政取消处一级）等等方面，都作出了一些成绩。但由于依恃敌伪八年统制的反动势力未解除，群众所受的灾难和痛苦未彻底清算，邪气未平，正气未伸，因而群众没有充分的发动起来，加之有些不合理的制度未加改造，还束缚着群众，因此群众未能觉悟到现在和过去的区别变化在那里。有的也想开展清算，但顾虑多为以“别惹人”“现在有吃的了”“事已过去不提他了”等想法来安慰自己。也有的埋怨我们没有帮助。因此，在劳动态度上有不正常的表现：有的是：解放了吃上了饱饭，以“良心”的驱使来劳动；有的因畏惧“怕打饭碗”而劳动；有的甚至以怠工来要求增资，攻击生产中积极分子，工作中不服指挥，甚至有偷窃的行为。这些都说明了：群众没有充分发动，群众的痛苦，没有很好申诉。即使日常的教育在口头上讲的如何好，劳动态度也不会根本改变，生产积极性也不会提高的。因此，为了劳资更好的合作，掀起大生产运动，积极支援前线，争取爱国自卫战争胜利。六河沟又提出继续发动群众，贯彻诉苦算账方针。
    诉苦清算运动在斗争周立轩（敌人时代劳务系大职员，过去克扣工人工资解放后又贪污公司款项）胜利之后，很快的发展起来。群众诉苦算账问题接二连三的提出来了，有的是敌人在时的劳务职员，工厂厂长、监工、窑下包工头、仗敌势欺人；有的是地痞、流氓、恶霸和为组织人员、巡官、翻译官、矿警队、守备队的无理压榨；有的是一般的克扣剥削（如粮食和工资）。由此，六河沟于七月间在反奸反恶霸及旧包工头等内容上展开了全矿区的职工诉苦清算运动。现在职工的生产情绪以及对公司和职工会的威信，已大大的提高，这证明比过去大不相同。当国民党进攻曲沟时，公司一个号召，全体职工就积极响应，搬运机器转移家属，只三天就完成了任务。工人纠察队由九十人扩大到三百人，日夜担任警戒工作。
    清算运动是在公司与工会两方共同配合之下发动的。首先双方在思想上本着劳资合作，互相帮助发展生产的精神，作了检讨；职工会认识到过去对公司的生产要求照顾不够，本身工作也不深入。而公司方面，过去却忽视职工工作，单纯强调生产。由此双方获得了一致认识；发动群众组织生产是公司与工会共同工作目标。随即决定七八月份，以发动群众诉苦清算为双方的中心任务，共同召开干部积极分子会，公司方面由经理、主任、厂长参加，职工会全体干部参加，讨论了如何发动群众，打通了思想，然后按群众住区、与生产部门情况，成立了四个工作组。领导上暂设一委员会统一指挥各组，群众斗争中，有关全矿的问题，由各组统一的去发动，部门小问题，由各组单独解决，各组须经常汇报，以便委员会随时了解各组情况，具体指导。在发动群众过程中，注意不要与生产行政工作脱节，注意改造群众思想，改革不合理的旧制度。要注意在工作态度上双方互相帮助，互相照顾，互相尊重，同心同德依靠群众，只有这样，才能真正充分把全矿区职工发动起来，这是开展运动的一个先决条件。
    其次是经过这次诉苦清算，争取了职员与技术工作。过去公司和工会的同志们，都认为职员与技术工人不好接近，工作不好作。实际证明当六河沟群众发动起来后，在这些人中间起了变化，有问题的，有的被群众揭露，得到了改造，有的自动向群众低头承认了错误。没问题而受过压榨的也积极参加了诉苦会。许多思想模糊的在群众运动影响下都自愿求进步，在大小诉苦会斗争会里，他们的思想改造了，觉悟提高了，这些说明了所谓“不好接近”“工作不好作”，其思想实质正是我们和群众间划了一道鸿沟，没有打通。经过这段运动，好坏人界限分清了，有些我们曾经认为坏的，经过运动才看出还可改造教育，这也是这次发动群众的一大收获。
    最后还应提出的是：这次运动中还解决了矿区与农村的关系问题。他们组织了公司、职工会与区政委三人委员会，有问题共同协商，以便在劳动群众上相互配合。不过领导思想上应明确农村的斗争方式不能搬到工厂乱用，同时又不能完全脱离农村的群众运动而孤立，这样才能彼此把关系搞好。
