　　International Briefs
    United Press: On the 10th, the Soviet Union ordered the prohibition of American aircraft from flying over Soviet-occupied zones in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania. All aircraft of American airlines ceased flying their Eastern European routes on that day and were stranded in Brussels.
    The newspaper "Izvestia" recently commented on the visit of the American aircraft carrier "Midway" to the Mediterranean, following the "Roosevelt," saying: "The American flag has apparently been turned into a scarecrow to frighten birds."
    Moscow Radio commentator Dr. Lang commented on the massive U.S. military expenditure, asking: "What is this for in peacetime, when there is no new threat of war?" He said: "The military expenditure that the United States spends in this one year of peace is equal to two-thirds of the total military expenditure of the country during one hundred and fifty years of peace and all wars (excluding the Civil War). But since the War of 1812, the United States has never been invaded. To many Americans, the trend towards militarism is a betrayal of the forefathers of America and is more difficult to explain than anywhere else."
    Washington: Eighteen prominent hotel servants here went on strike on the 12th. Four thousand male and female servants, elevator operators, telephone operators, movers, cooks, etc., belonging to the American Federation of Labor, held demonstrations.
    American shipping has been paralyzed for twelve days due to the strike of marine technicians. During this period, only a few liaison ships sailed from ports across the United States.
    Rome: 50,000 Italian strikers and unemployed workers (mostly road construction workers) held fierce demonstrations on the 9th to protest against hoarding, high cost of living, and the government's dismissal of road construction workers.
    Washington: Just as the reactionary Greek government is actively engaged in civil war, U.S. Foreign Property Administration Director General Conner suddenly announced that the U.S. government would grant Greece a $25 million line of credit to purchase surplus U.S. war materials. The United States had already granted Greece two lines of credit this year in May and September, totaling $10 million.
    Paris: Elections in the four provinces and cities of the French-occupied zone of Germany have come to an end. The results are as follows: The Communist Party won over 147,000 votes, the Socialist Party won over 474,000 votes, the Christian Democratic Party won 1,065,000 votes, and the Liberal Democratic Party won over 134,000 votes.
