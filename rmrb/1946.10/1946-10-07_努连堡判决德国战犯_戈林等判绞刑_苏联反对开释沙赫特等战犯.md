　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. TASS, Nuremberg: After months of trial by the Nuremberg International Tribunal, the leading German fascist war criminals were sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 1st. Göring, Ribbentrop and others were sentenced to be hanged. After reading the verdict, the presiding judge of the court made the following statement: "The representatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics present at the court hope to have their disagreement with the court's decisions regarding the defendants Schacht, von Papen, and Fritzsche recorded. They insist that these defendants must be convicted and not acquitted. They also disagree with the decision regarding the General Staff and the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, and insist that these bodies must be recognized as criminal organizations. They also disagree with the sentence of the defendant Hess, and insist that he be sentenced to death rather than life imprisonment. This disagreement will be submitted in writing, attached to the verdict, and will be published as soon as possible."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Moscow: Pravda commented in an editorial titled "A Historic Verdict": The international tribunal composed of judges from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France imposed the death penalty on the first group of German fascist aggressors as a just punishment. This is the retribution deserved for all the war terrors and heinous crimes of the German fascist executioners. The execution of these most important criminals by the Nuremberg Tribunal demonstrates the spirit of combat cooperation between the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The Soviet people and all progressive people are sincerely satisfied with the verdict of the International Tribunal, which is the verdict of history itself. However, it should be pointed out that the International Tribunal's opinions on some defendants were not entirely consistent. For example, regarding the reduced sentences for Hess and others, and the acquittal of Schacht and Fritzsche, the Soviet judge of the International Tribunal could not abandon the special statement on this section of the verdict and reserved his opinion. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the Nuremberg verdict will be actively praised by all loyal people around the world. The historical trial has passed, and this is the first time that the organizers, conspiratorial leaders, instigators, and executors of aggressive wars have been given just punishment. This is a verdict against aggression and aggressors, and a serious warning to all new acts of aggression and provocateurs who launch new wars against peace-loving nations.

　　努连堡判决德国战犯
    戈林等判绞刑
    苏联反对开释沙赫特等战犯
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社努连堡讯：经努连堡国际法庭数月之审判，德国首要法西斯战犯，已于一日下午二时宣判，戈林、里宾特洛甫等已判绞刑。法庭审判长于宣读判决书之后，作了以下的声明：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联邦出席法庭人员，希望将其不同意法庭关于被告沙赫特、巴本与弗烈兹等的决定的意见载于记载中，他坚持这些被告必须定罪而不得开释；他也不同意关于德国内阁参谋本部与最高统帅部的决定，并坚持必须承认此等机关为罪犯组织；他也不同意对被告赫斯的判决，并坚持将其判处死刑而非终身监禁。此种不同意见，将以书面提出，附于判决书后，并将尽早公布。”
    【新华社延安三日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于题为《历史的判决》社论中评称：苏美英法四国法官组成的国际法庭，对首批的德国法西斯侵略者处以极刑是公正的刑罚，这是德国法西斯刽子手的一切战争恐怖与一切穷凶极恶罪行所应得的报应。努连堡法庭对这些最重要罪犯的处决，表现了苏美英法战斗合作的精神。苏联人民与一切进步的人群都衷心满意的欢迎国际法庭的判决书，这是历史本身的判决书。不过应该指出，国际法庭对于某些被告的意见并不是完全一致的，譬如关于赫斯等的减刑与沙赫特、弗烈兹的开释，国际法庭的苏联法官不能放弃对判决书这一段的特别声明，并保留他的意见。纵然如此，可是应该强调指出，努连堡的判决将得到全世界一切忠诚人民的积极赞扬。历史的审判已经过去，这是第一次给侵略战争的组织者阴谋魁首煽动者及其计划的执行者以公正的处分，这是对侵略与侵略者的判决，并对一切新侵略行为和对爱好和平民族发动新战争的挑拨者提出了严重警告。
