Why Did I Join the Chinese Communist Party?
Chen Jinkun

Editor's Note: Professor Chen Jinkun, a 60-year-old jurist, visited Yan'an in June. Recently, he arrived in Zhangjiakou from Beiping and decided to participate in the work of the liberated areas. This article, written by Mr. Chen after arriving in Zhangjiakou, is his political statement.

My personal circumstances are well known to my close relatives and friends. When Japan was about to surrender, I had already decided to buy land outside Chaoyangmen in Beiping (closer to my home), build a garden, plant flowers, and grow vegetables to enjoy my later years. Even in these times of incredibly high living costs, my modest wealth is enough to support myself. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, I have sold real estate and stocks in recent years for a remaining sum of 10 million yuan, with a monthly interest income of 1 million yuan. If I were to accept a professorship at Peking University or Chaoyang University, and also work as a lawyer, I could earn several million yuan per month. Lawyers and professors are both free and noble professions, but lawyers are not noble in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Therefore, I declared that I would not work as a lawyer even before the Kuomintang announced the "suspension of lawyers' practice in the occupied areas." As for professors, I wanted to get rid of them in their controlled areas because of excessive Kuomintangization, and I had already resigned from all university directorships and honorary professorships. "Unfortunately, when Japan surrendered, after hearing Chairman Chiang's announcement on the radio regarding the handling of enemy and puppet troops and the acceptance of surrender, I immediately concluded that there would be much trouble in the world." On August 20th of last year, I made this cold remark at a dinner party with old friends, which was opposed by one of my old classmates, Mr. So-and-so. I didn't argue deeply at the time, but now Mr. So-and-so should recall that my words slightly touched upon current malpractices. Subsequently, on August 20th of last year, I drafted an article titled "A Letter to the People of the Nation," strongly urging Chiang Kai-shek to "serve the country with loyalty and at the same time, make it clear that I only guarded my personal post before, and from now on, I should try my best to fulfill the responsibility of a seer and prevent others from repeating the danger of a second national subjugation." Later, I expressed my opinions in newspapers and private letters no less than dozens of times, advising the opening of political power and the correction of law, the cessation of civil war and the winning of popular support, and the mediation by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. While giving a speech at Zhongshan Park at the invitation of students, I was beaten and left with a bloody head. However, I immediately told reporters at the time: I will never be deterred by a stone. I should still move forward to do things for the country. Therefore, I still continued to write articles discussing current affairs in the Beiping Liberation Daily and other democratic publications. When the Kuomintang closed down these publications, I knew that the Kuomintang was determined to maintain dictatorship and autocracy and oppose peace and democracy. "The Kuomintang is not worth working for, and will eventually bring disaster to the country!" I said this in my graduation speech at the Judicial Reserve Training Center in the 17th year of the Republic. I never attended university memorial weeks after that. In the 11th year of the Republic, my old friend Luo Junjian invited me to Nanjing to take office, but I left without saying goodbye after only five months. "I had no choice but to look around for democratic forces in the country and choose those who could cooperate. I went to Yan'an and Zhangjiakou for visits one after another, and saw that whether from the upper-level leaders or lower-level cadres, the political views, economic measures, administrative efficiency, the sincerity of the personnel, and the work were all intensive. There was no bureaucratic habit, let alone corruption. The army training, the spirit of the soldiers, the universal education, the improvement of culture, the stability of finance, the reduction of people's burdens (the heaviest burden of the people has never exceeded 30%), the stability of order, the disappearance of bandits (the doors are not closed at night and there are very few policemen), the upward life, the scarcity of poverty (the disappearance of beggars), the daily burden of teachers and staff members is guaranteed for themselves and their families), the development of democracy, the self-government of villages, the cooperation between officials and people, the mutual love between officers and soldiers (the soldiers' treatment is particularly good, and the spirit of officers teaching soldiers and soldiers teaching officers is brought into play), stepping up learning, and encouraging production (staff members also study and produce every day, various organs organize production, and encourage people to produce, advocate "labor heroes," and cooperative undertakings are particularly developed), organizing the masses, and strengthening self-defense (in addition to organizing various groups, militias are also organized, and all people know how to defend the country and protect their hometowns), from any point of observation, I feel that the Communist Party and the country are worlds apart. Two conclusions: the liberated area is not heaven, but the non-liberated area is indeed hell. I have written travel notes about Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, which will be published soon.

Let's leave aside settling the old scores of the Kuomintang (the Kuomintang's so-called "Three People's Principles" have no special content. It was not until Sun Yat-sen cooperated with the CCP, tolerated the Communists, and allied with the Soviet Union that there was new content, new vitality, and new strength. Therefore, the victory of the revolution was actually mostly due to the strength of the CCP. However, after the Kuomintang initially opposed the Communists, it successively opposed Gui, Feng, Yan, Lu, Wang, and Hu. From the unification of the Republic of China in the 17th year to the "July 7th" Incident in the 26th year, there was hardly a year without civil war, which led to the country's weakness and repeated foreign troubles. Therefore, the Kuomintang's crime of harming the country and the people is no less than that of the Northern Warlords). Speaking only from the "July 7th" Incident onwards, the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was only for a very short period. After that, the Kuomintang focused primarily on preventing communism and secondarily on resisting Japan. They not only did not issue a single penny or weapon to the Communist Party, but also detained the medicine donated to the CCP by foreigners; furthermore, they dissolved the New Fourth Army, which was determined to resist Japan. For Yan'an and other CCP anti-Japanese regions, they either stationed heavy troops or launched light attacks. Most of the military supplies distributed by the United States were also hidden and not used, so that not a single heavy city could be defended, and no transportation could be uninterrupted. They were trapped in Chongqing, relying solely on foreign aid. On the contrary, the CCP contained more than one million enemy troops behind enemy lines, and swept them away from time to time, but could only occupy a point or a line in the end. The CCP combined the army and the people, and its power increased day by day, so the United States also advocated uniting with the Communists to resist Japan together, but it was envied by the Kuomintang, so when Japan surrendered, it decided to eliminate them. For traitors and enemies, they advocated leniency; for enemy and puppet troops and stationed areas, they explicitly allowed it, and even reused and treated the chief traitors favorably. Only the "people's army" that had contributed to the resistance against Japan was regarded as a bandit. In addition to having the US military supervise, they also had enemy and puppet troops supervise, and they were not allowed to accept surrender nearby. They had to use US planes and warships to escort their confidants and mechanical troops from tens of millions of miles away to receive military equipment, cities, and so-called "sovereignty," so that the enemy could calmly destroy and hide their machines, documents, important materials, and huge factories without leaving anything behind during this long period, and they continued to trample on the local people without any scruples. The traitor army even forgot its purpose and openly recruited new soldiers in Beiping. All of this is outrageous! After the takeover, they brought all the corrupt customs of the rear to the front, and all the extravagant bad habits. In the past, only those who made fortunes from the war of resistance did evil, but now those who make fortunes from the takeover do evil. "Three Oceans Open Peace," "Five Sons Ascend the Rank," and "People Yearn for the Han" are all impressions of central officials and the army by the so-called "puppet people" in the occupied areas. These people only rob things and do not do things. Puppet currency is arbitrarily suppressed at low prices, and fiat currency is arbitrarily issued crazily. State-owned enterprises arbitrarily increase prices by dozens, hundreds, or thousands of times at any time. The lives of "puppet people" have risen more than 10,000 times higher than during the enemy and puppet times, and the rear has also risen accordingly. All or part of the daily necessities and international relief items received and collected are also used for civil war. Those who have been clearly exempted from land tax are again levied public grain, and the amount levied is much more than the amount reduced. Innumerable exactions and miscellaneous taxes are levied, at least half or more of the income. In the past history of our country, each revolution had only one factor: political corruption; now there is an additional factor: economic collapse. In previous revolutions, only the poor could not survive, but now even the rich cannot survive. Foreign goods are flooded, factories are closed, shops are closed, and farmers stop plowing. In Shanghai, herds of cattle parade in the streets, and in Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces, many people starve to death every day. The whole people are in the furnace of fire, while one person is still resting in Lushan! All these phenomena are caused by civil war. The appeals of the people of the whole country are not heard, the mediation of the envoys of the alliance is unsuccessful, the promises made personally are not counted, and the signatures are invalid; sometimes the Kuomintang government convenes the Political Consultative Conference, sometimes the Second Plenary Session overturns the Political Consultative Conference, sometimes the war is stopped outside the pass but not inside the pass, and sometimes the war is stopped inside the pass but not outside the pass, sometimes they insist that the local government should be resolved through consultation with the joint government, and sometimes they advocate that the government in some areas must be completely revoked 15 days or 8 days after the decision to stop the war, and the so-called number has increased, and the so-called "payment" may also change in the future. The Kuomintang is playing wishful thinking, thinking that it fully possesses the sophisticated US weapons and aircraft, and can continuously supply arms, warships and funds from the United States. Furthermore, the US warships will transport troops and weapons on their behalf, and the army will guard the port and the land on their behalf. The Communist Party has none of this. With such an absolute advantage, how can it not fight a civil war! It thinks that it can eliminate the "traitors" in "eight weeks or half a year" or "one year"; if it fails, there is another trick. It is "war without declaration", that is, the announcement states "political solution", and the Ms. Statement also states "continue mediation" and then it can still be mediated by the big boss of the United States. If the fighting is good, it will be completely eliminated; if the fighting is not good, it can at least be forced to obey. The level is in strength, and you can find support everywhere. What fear is there for the people? What worry is there for civil war? May I ask, is there any precedent in Chinese and foreign history for such an "evil government"?

Looking at the Communist Party again, the crimes added by the Kuomintang are that it owns troops, occupies territory, destroys transportation, and does not obey laws, and this is also confused by a few people inside and outside, and "stubborn elements" or deliberately make excuses. The "selfish elements" say that the laws are the laws of one-party dictatorship. Relying on the founding program set by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the tutelage was originally limited to the "shortest period" and should immediately promote self-government and enter constitutional government. The Kuomintang has been under tutelage for nineteen years and still wants to maintain dictatorship and autocracy. The so-called tutelage covenant has been ineffective according to the "time limit of law". After the CCP recovered and liberated the land lost by the Kuomintang, it determined self-government and implemented democracy. What "illegal" can be said? Moreover, there is now a "Political Consultative Conference Resolution" to replace the tutelage covenant, which clearly stipulates "confirming the current local government and self-government", then the Kuomintang's destruction is destroying the law, and the Communist Party's support is protecting the law. Moreover, the so-called destruction of transportation is a natural measure for the liberated areas to implement self-defense. Is there any reason in the world for someone to invade unreasonably, and I will willingly endure it? As for the establishment of local government and people's army, it is also the land that the Kuomintang has derelicted and abandoned; the Communist Party cooperates with the people to rise up and defend themselves, which is a natural result. "Criminal Law: Dereliction of duty and abandonment of land shall be punished with the death penalty." Ordinary people advocate democracy, and the Kuomintang has beaten and killed them in thousands of cases. In the future, the atrocities of secret agents will only increase, and there are few such actions against the Communist Party, precisely because it has a people's army and established a people's government. May I ask, apart from a few selfish and stubborn elements, how can the people of the whole country not think of supporting and assisting such a "righteous army" and "benevolent government"! Furthermore, the current comparison between the advantages and disadvantages of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is not in their ideology, but in their politics. The CCP marks "New Democracy" and "New Capitalism", and requires the unity and cooperation of all parties, non-party members, and all intellectuals. It marks the "three-thirds system", that is, politics still implements constitutional government, and economy still encourages capital, but it prevents the abuses of the old constitutional government and old capitalist countries, and implements universal suffrage, using "only talent as a collection of non-party saints to participate, only allowing this party to account for one-third in "all strata", and the remaining two-thirds are for non-party people. Such treatment is far better than the Kuomintang. The current economic policy is only to implement rent reduction and interest reduction, and labor-capital cooperation, which is completely in line with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of regulating capital. The so-called "two-five rent reduction" was originally stipulated by the current land law, and the Kuomintang has repeatedly ordered its implementation (the non-liberated area has laws but has not implemented them). The extreme "land distribution" policy is also consistent with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of "farmers have their land". When confiscating, it is only for the land of local tyrants, corruption, and enemies and puppets, which is of course. The so-called "liquidation" and "struggle" are also the emotions and natural measures that the oppressed masses should have when they are first liberated. There are occasional excessive and abnormal situations, which are also temporary phenomena. The occasional distribution of land by large landlords is not special from the principle of law that the interests of the majority sacrifice the interests of the minority. Moreover, the Communist Party has now decided that, except for unjustifiable reasons, the status quo should be maintained in order to wait for a future overall solution. The Kuomintang used these few unjust and occasionally sacrificed elements to fabricate rumors, but the truth cannot be concealed by temporary evil propaganda. The Communist Party's current basic program is "anti-imperialism" and "anti-feudalism", that is, one to seek national independence and equality, and one to seek people's democracy and freedom. This not only reverses the history of China for more than a hundred years, but also reverses the history of thousands of years. I dare to assert that only the Communist Party can complete this historical task. Only when the country is independent and the people are democratic can it truly become one of the four strong powers and assume the responsibility of jointly maintaining world peace. I also dare to assert that only the Communist Party can complete this world task. In order to deceive the United States for "military assistance" in order to maintain its dictatorship and autocracy, the Kuomintang echoed or colluded with some selfish and stubborn elements in the United States, emphasizing the Third World War and the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, and did not hesitate to "sell itself" and "sell the country", handing over all sovereignty and privileges such as territorial waters, territory, airspace, inland navigation, and military training, which Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, and Wang Jingwei dared not do before. In fact, in history, there is absolutely no "evil government", especially a "traitorous government" that can last long. The "strategic base" and "vanguard of combat" provided by the Kuomintang to the United States are absolutely empty checks. At present, even if the Chinese people are suffering and have no way to survive, they will also harm the American people. Not only has the traditional friendship been destroyed, but the future war factors have also increased, which is unfavorable to both China and the United States. On the contrary, the CCP has no political relationship with the Soviet Union in the liberated areas and the Soviet Union regarding the relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which is known to the Chinese people. Although the CCP regards the Soviet Union as an advanced country in terms of ideology, the steps are different due to different national conditions. The Soviet Union is only in the middle stage of socialism, not in the final stage of socialism. Both believe in materialism, but China's material conditions are far inferior to those of the Soviet Union, so it can only implement new democracy and new capitalism, and even this requires a long period of time. The Kuomintang is spreading rumors about this, and people at home and abroad are also worried about this, which is not worth arguing about. China should have independent diplomacy, especially for the three allied countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and should maintain equal and mutually beneficial friendship. The United States' "economic assistance" is also sincerely accepted under this principle, with the aim of completing the goal of becoming a strong country as soon as possible, so as to be a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, and to maintain world stability. This is the goal of the CCP and the goal of the people of the whole country. Only in this way can the strategic base problem not occur, and the problem of being pro-American or pro-Soviet alone will not occur. How can the Kuomintang talk about this!

The Kuomintang thinks that it cannot be reconciled, cannot be delayed, and can still be fought, so the civil war policy and the secret agent policy are advancing at the same time. Thousands of democratic people have been beaten, killed, arrested, and searched, and thousands of newspapers have been suspended and publications banned. This is really the end of the road, a reversal of history, and the final struggle! Carrying out civil war is just killing compatriots, and using sophisticated foreign weapons to kill the country's anti-Japanese troops and democratic people. In Chinese and foreign history, there is only one Kuomintang. The Kuomintang thinks that as long as the United States helps with arms and funds, it can win the war and eliminate the "enemy". It does not know that "the division is strong" and "winning hearts is the most important thing" are military iron rules. From the perspective of discerning people, the situation that the Kuomintang is fantasizing about is absolutely impossible. The CCP has always adhered to the purpose of serving the people, so the army it leads is entirely a "people's army", that is, the army and the people are one. The Kuomintang's "sophisticated weapons" can kill some soldiers, but cannot kill all the people; it can occupy some land, but cannot eliminate the entire liberated area. How is the combat effectiveness of the Kuomintang army, and what is the war performance in the past year, is obvious to everyone. Whether the "sophisticated weapons" are "beautiful gifts" is also obvious to everyone. Therefore, if the Kuomintang continues to fight and the United States continues to help, if we do not look at the temporary phenomenon but at the long-term future, there are only two situations: the Kuomintang will suffer a greater loss, "this is very likely", and only suffer a small loss, "this is only a small possibility." The last situation is only to make China chaotic for a long time, and the people suffer for a long time, which is extremely unfortunate for China, and extremely unfavorable for the United States. Therefore, people in both China and the United States must rise up to correct this "harmful" wrong policy of the two governments.

The reverse of the wrong policy is the correct policy. The policy declared by the United States alone and jointly with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom is to "assist China in completing a peaceful, unified, united, cooperative, democratic, and strong country", is to "not interfere in China's internal affairs", is to "withdraw troops from China", and the United States has sent Marshall Special Envoy to assist the National Government based on this policy and establish "Ceasefire Agreement", "Political Consultative Conference Resolution", and "Military Reorganization Plan" three programs, and is being implemented. This is the "fire-fighting" policy. Another "aid to the National Government" policy of the US government is the "fueling" policy. The cruel civil war that has never happened in Chinese and foreign history is currently underway. The emergency method should be to first "unconditionally and fully cease the war", and then "negotiate the establishment of a coalition government. The rest, such as local government, the completion of the draft law, and the date of the National Congress, can be resolved through negotiation. This is the unanimous demand of the entire Chinese people, and it is also the unanimous hope of the people of the world. However, the governments of China and the United States may not be able to rein in their horses, and the people of the two countries still need to make considerable efforts. I am not talented, but I am also one of the people who want to work hard, and I am determined to participate in the work of the CCP, which is why. The Kuomintang often ridicules the CCP with the word "chaos", and people at home and abroad often suspect the word "chaos". The opposite of the word "chaos" is the word "governance". The Communist Party has always been a "revolutionary party", but in the past it was a "bloody revolution", and now they hope for a "non-bloody revolution". Revolution is to break the status quo. People who retain the status quo think of it as "chaos", and they do not know that change is only a temporary phenomenon. Construction is a permanent attempt. Under the new democracy, in addition to political construction and economic construction, there is also legal construction. I am still an old hand in law, and I will participate in the work in this area. At this time of historical turnaround and the establishment of democracy forever, I also want to fulfill the responsibility of a commoner.

　　余为何参加中共工作？
    陈瑾昆
    编者按：六十老人、法学家陈瑾昆教授，六月间曾来延安视察，最近由北平到张家口，决心参加解放区工作。本文系陈先生到张家口以后所作，是他的一篇政治声明。
    余个人境况，至近亲友均能知之。在日本将投降时，原已决意在平市朝阳门外（住家距离较近）购地、筑圃、栽花、种菜娱我晚年。即在目前生活奇昂之时，以我小康，亦尚可自给。余在国民党统治区，年来出卖房地股票价金余额一千万元，月息收入百万元；若受北大或朝阳教授之聘，兼作律师，亦可月入数百万元。律师本与教授均为自由职业，且为高尚职业，然在国民党统治区律师并不高尚，故余早在国民党宣区“停止沦区陷布律师执行职务期间”以前，即宣言不作律师，教授则因国民党化太甚，亦欲在其统治区内力图摆脱，且早将各大学主任与名誉教授均辞去。“所不幸者，在日本刚投降时，由广播闻悉蒋主席所宣布之敌伪军队与接收投降办法，即断定天下从此多事。”适在去年八月二十日前，老友聚餐席上发此冷语，为我老同学某公反对，当未深辩，至今某公当回忆吾言微中时弊。旋于去年八月二十日，草“告国人书”一文，力劝蒋公“公忠体国，同时言明余以前只守个人岗位，自此当勉尽先知立言责任，以阻止他人，再蹈第二次亡国危险”。以后则于劝告开放政权正法治，停止内战收人心，美、苏、英三国出面调停等，在报纸与私函上发表意见不下数十次，中山公园应学生邀请演讲时，竟被打得头破血流。然余当时即面告记者：决不为一块石头骇退，对国家应作的事，仍当向前作去，故亦仍在平市解放报与其他民主刊物不断为文讨论时事。及国民党封闭此各刊物，余知国民党已决心维持专政与独裁，反对和平与民主。“国民党不足有为，且终必祸国！”余于民十七司法储材馆毕业演词，即已言之。以后从不出席大学纪念周。民国十一年，故友罗君钧任坚邀往南京作官，亦仅五月即不辞而别。“只得环顾国内民主力量，择其可与合作者。曾先后去延安与张家口参观，则见其无论从上层领袖，下级干部，政治见解、经济措施、行政效能，人员真挚，工作均紧张，无官僚习气，更无贪污情形。军队训练，士兵精神，教育普遍，文化提高，金融稳固，民负减轻（民负最重亦未有超过百分之三十者），秩序安定，盗匪绝迹（夜间不闭户且警察极少），生活向上，贫困日稀（乞丐绝迹），教职员管其本人及家属日常负担），民主发达，乡村自治，官民合作，官兵互爱（士兵待遇特优，且发挥官教兵，兵教官精神），加紧学习，奖励生产（工作人员亦每日学习与生产，各机关组织生产，并奖励人民生产，提倡“劳动英雄”，合作事业尤为发达），组织民众，加强自卫（除组织各团体外，并组织民兵，一切民众均知卫国保乡）等任何点观察，均觉共与国有天渊别。两句结论：解放区虽尚非天堂，非解放区则确为地狱。余著有延安与张家口旅行记，不久可问世。
    国民党旧账姑不清算（国民党所谓“三民主义”并无特别内容，自孙中山先生与中共合作，容共、联苏始有新内容，新生气，新力量，故革命胜利亦实中共之力居多，乃国民党最初反共以后，则接连反桂、反冯、反阎、反鲁、反汪、反胡，自民国十七年统一以后，廿六年“七七”事变时止，几无一年无内战，以致国力不张，外患迭起，故国民党祸国殃民之罪，乃不在北洋军阀以下），专自“七七”事变以后言之，国共合作只极短时期，以后国民党几以防共为主，抗日为次，对于共产党不但不发一饷一械，即外人捐给中共之医药也扣留不放；且更进一步解散坚决抗战之新四军。对于延安与其他中共抗战区域，则或使重兵驻守，或使轻军袭击。美国配给之军火亦多藏留不用，以致无一重城能守，无一交通不断，困守重庆，专恃外援。反是，中共则在敌后牵制敌方百余万大军，时时扫荡，亦终只能占据一点一线。中共以军队与人民结合，势力日增，故美方亦主张联共一同抗战，却遭国民党之嫉，遂于日本投降之时，决心将其消灭。对于汉奸与敌人则主张宽大，对于敌伪军队与驻扎地区，则明令准许，甚至对于首要汉奸亦加以重用与优待，独对于抗战有功之“人民军队”则视如寇仇，除使美国军队监视外，并使敌伪军队监视，更不许其就近接受投降，必用美方飞机、军舰自数千万里外护送自己心腹与机械部队前往接收军械、城市与所谓“主权”，以致敌人在此长久期间，将其机器、文书、重要物资、巨大工厂均得从容毁弃藏匿而无余，且对于当地人民依旧蹂躏，毫无顾忌，汉奸军队则更忘其所以，即在平市亦公然招募新兵。凡此种种，无不令人发指！及至接收以后，则将后方贪污恶风全部带来，奢靡恶习，亦全部带来。以前只见发抗战财者作恶，今则更见发接收财者作恶，“三洋开泰”，“五子登科”、“人心思汉”均系所谓沦陷区域内“伪民”对于中央官吏与军队之印象。此辈只抢东西，不办事情，伪币任意低压，法币任意狂发，公营事业任意随时加价数十百千倍，“伪民”生活已较敌伪时高涨万倍以上，后方自亦随之而涨。所接收与所收到之日常生活物资与国际救济物品，亦全部或一部供内战之用。已明免田赋者，又改征公粮，所征远较所减者为多。苛捐杂税更不胜枚举，所征至少在所入一半以上。我国以前历史，每次革命均只一因素：政治腐败；今则更加一因素：经济崩溃。以前革命时，均只穷人不能活，今则富人亦不能活。外货充斥、工厂关闭、商店歇业，农民辍耕，在上海且有牛群游街，湘、粤、桂等省则更每日饿毙多人，全民均在火炼炉焦，一人尚在庐山歇凉！凡此现象，均系内战造成。全国民众呼吁之不听，邦盟特使调解之不成，亲口诺言不算，亲笔签字无效；忽而由国民政府召开政协，忽而由二中全会推翻政协，忽而关内停战关外不停战，忽而关外停战关内不停战，忽而坚持地方政权应俟联合政府协商解决，忽而主张若干地区政权在决定停战命令十五日与八日后即须完全撤销，且所谓若干数目则有增无巳，最后所谓“交款”恐将来亦有变更。在国民党，固打如意算盘，以为己方充分保有美国精良兵器与飞机，可源源由美国供给军火军舰款项，再有美国军舰代为运兵运械，军队代为守口守地，共产党则全然无之，以如此绝对优势，焉得不打内战！自以为或“八星期或半年”、“或一年”即可将“叛徒”消灭；万一不能如意，则尚有另一手法，本系“战而不宣”即文告言明“政治解决”，马司声明亦言明“继续调停”届时仍可由大老板之美国调停。打得好，则完全将其消灭；打得不好，亦至少可使就范。高下在力，左右逢源，又何惧人民？又何愁内战？试问如此之“恶政府”？中外历史上有无前例？
    再就共产党言之，国民党所加罪者在其拥有军队，据有地盘，破坏交通，不遵法令，此亦有少数内外人士为其所惑者，“顽固分子”或故为借口者。“自私分子”所谓法令乃为一党专政之法令。依靠中山先生所定建国纲领，训政原只限于“最短时期”，应立即推行自治进入宪政。国民党训政十九年，仍欲维持专政与独裁，所谓训政约法，依“法律时效”本已不能有效。中共将国民党失去土地收复解放后，确定自治，施行民主，有何“违法”之可言？况在今日有代替训政约法之“政协决议”，明定“确认现在地方政权与自治”，则国民党摧毁之乃为毁法，共产党拥护之则为护法。又，所谓破坏交通，则为解放区实行自卫当然之措施，天下安有人来无理侵犯，我则甘心忍受之理？至地方政权与人民军队之成立，亦为国民党渎职弃守丧失之土地；共产党协同人民起而自卫，乃当然之结果。“刑法：渎职罪、委弃土地，应处死刑”。普通人士主张民主，则遭国民党打杀有千数百起，以后特务暴行将更有加无已，独对于共产党尚少有此举动，亦正以其拥有人民军队，树有人民政权。试问此等“义师”“仁政”，全国民众除少数自私与顽固分子外，焉有不群思拥护与扶持之理！尤有进者，现时比较国共优劣，不在其主义，而在其政治中共标明“新民主主义”与“新资本主义”，并要求各党派、无党派、一切知识阶级团结合作。标明“三三制”，即政治仍实行宪政，经济仍奖励资本，只对于旧宪政、旧资本国家之流弊，则加以防止，且实行普选，用“惟才为征集党外圣达参加，只许本党在‘各阶层’占三分之一，余三分之二则用党外之人，此等处置，远较国民党为优。经济政策目前尚只实行减租减息，劳资合作，此完全与孙中山先生节制资本之原则相符。所谓“二五减租”，本为现行土地法所定，国民党亦迭有命令，应予实行（非解放区系有法而未行）。极端之“土地分配”政策，亦与孙中山先生“耕者有其田”之政策一致，没收时，实只对于土劣、贪污、敌伪之土地行之，此本属当然。所谓“清算”、“斗争”亦为被压迫群众初被解放时应有之情绪与当然之措施，偶有过分失常情形，亦为一时现象。大地主土地偶被分配，自法律为多数利益牺牲少数利益之原则言之，亦并非特殊。况共产党现时亦已决定除有不正当原因外，仍应维持现状，以俟将来整个解决。国民党利用此少数不正当而偶牺牲之分子滥造谣言，然真相终不能因一时恶宣传而掩蔽也。共产党目前基本政纲为“反帝”与“反封建”，即一以求国家之独立平等，一以求人民之民主自由，此不但翻转中国近百余年历史，且翻转数千年历史。余敢断言，只有共产党始能完成此历史任务。国家独立，人民民主，始能真正成为四强之一，负起共同维持世界和平之责任。余亦敢断言，只有共产党始能完成此世界任务。国民党为骗取美国“军事援助”，以便维持其独裁专政，遂与美国一部分自私顽固分子呼应或勾结，强调第三次世界大战与美苏冲突，不惜“卖身”与“卖国”，将领海、领土、领空、内航、练兵等一切主权与特权一手断送，为以前袁世凯，段祺瑞、汪精卫等所不敢为者。实则，在历史上，决无“恶政府”尤其“卖国政府”可以长存者，国民党对美所提供之“战略基地”，“作战先锋”，绝对是空头支票。当前即使中国人民遭灾已无活路，跟着亦使美国人民受害，不但历来之亲善传统为之摧毁，未来之战争因素且反增加，此在中美两国均为不利。反是，中共对于美、苏、中关系在解放区与苏联并无政治关系，此国人所知者。中共于主义上虽以苏联为先进国，但因国情不同，步骤亦自不同。苏联尚仅入中途社会主义之阶段，未入终局社会主义之阶段。同为信奉唯物论者，但物资条件中国现时远不及苏联，故只能实行新民主主义与新资本主义，即此尚须一长久时期。国民党就此造谣，国内外人士亦因此杞忧，实不足一辩。中国应有独立外交，尤对于美、苏、英三盟邦，自更应维持平等互惠之友谊，美国之“经济援助”在此原则下，自亦诚意接受，总期早日完成为强盛国家，以作美苏桥梁，以维世界安定，此为中共之目标，亦为全国人民之目标，必如此，方不发生战略基地问题，更不发生单独亲美亲苏问题，国民党何足以语此！
    国民党以为不可和，不能拖，还可打，于是内战政策与特务政策同时并进，打杀捕搜民主人士已有千数百起，停刊报纸、禁运刊物亦有千数百条，此真所谓日暮途穷，倒行逆施，最后挣扎！进行内战，只是以同胞残杀同胞，而以外国精良武器残杀本国抗战部队与民主人民，则在中外历史上，实只有一个国民党。国民党固以为只要有美国帮助军火款项，就可以打胜仗，消灭“敌人”，殊不知“师直为壮”，“收心为上”乃为军事铁则。自明眼人观察，国民党所幻想之情形，实为绝对不可能。中共乃始终抱为人民服务之宗旨，故其所领导之军队全为“人民军队”，即军队与人民打成一片。国民党之“精良武器”可以杀死一部分士兵，不能杀光全部人民；可以占领一部分土地，不能消灭整个解放区。国民党军队战斗力如何，一年来战争成绩如何，固昭昭在人耳目者，“精良武器”是否即“优美礼品”，亦昭昭在人耳目者。故如国民党继续打下去，美国亦继续帮下去，如果不就一时之现象而就长远之前途言之，只有两种情形：国民党更吃大亏，“此实有大大可能”，只吃小亏，“此仅有小小可能。”最后一种情形，不过使中国长期混乱，人民长期涂炭，于中国固为极端不幸，于美国实亦极端不利，所以中美两国人士，均须群起纠正两国政府此种“损人损己”之错误政策。
    错误政策的反面就是正确政策。美国单独并与苏英共同所声明的政策，是“协助中国完成为和平、统一、团结、合作、民主、强盛的国家”，是“不干涉中国内政”，是“由中国撤兵”，且美国依据此政策，遣派马歇尔特使来协助国民政府，成立“停战协定”、“政协会决议”、“整军方案”三个方案，并正在执行。此方为“救火”政策。美国政府另一“援助国民政府”政策，则为“添油”政策。当前已正在进行中外历史上未有之残酷内战，急救方法自应先行“无条件全面停战”，再行“协议成立联合政府，余如地方政权、完法草案、国大会期等，均可协议解决，此为全中国人民一致要求者，亦为全世界人民一致希望者。不过中美两国政府恐未必均能悬崖勒马，尚须两国人民相当努力。余不敏，亦为藕欲努力之一人，决心参加中共工作，亦即在此。国民党对于中共往往以一“乱”字相讥，国内外人士亦往往以一“乱”字相疑。“乱”字反面即为“治”字中，共乃始终为一“革命党”，不过以前系“流血革命”，现在他们希望“不流血革命”。革命为打破现状留继现状之人则以之为“乱”，不知改变，只为一时现象。建设方为永久企图，在新民主主义下，除政治建设、经济建设外，亦尚有法律建设。余于法律尚为识途老马，将于此方面参加工作。此历史翻篇、民主永立之时，余亦欲尽匹夫之责而已。
