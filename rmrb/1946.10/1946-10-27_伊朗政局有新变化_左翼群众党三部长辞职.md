　　New Changes in Iranian Political Situation
    Three Ministers from Left-Wing Tudeh Party Resign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Comprehensive reports indicate that there have been recent new changes in the Iranian political situation. The Sultani cabinet was reorganized on the 19th, with the resignation of three ministers from the left-wing Tudeh Party, and the more enlightened Minister of Propaganda, Prince Firouz, was also transferred to the position of ambassador to the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of the Tudeh Party issued a statement on the same day, criticizing the reorganization and declaring that it "will continue to fight for democracy." The Tehran newspaper "Central Times" pointed out that the resignation of the three ministers of the Tudeh Party was due to disagreements between the party and Sultani on issues such as the attitude towards the reactionary rebellion in Fars province and the Democratic Party's (Sultani is its leader) monopoly of the election committee. According to a United Press reporter, Sultani's reorganization of his cabinet was a compromise with the rebels in southern Fars province, because the Qashqai tribe in the province launched a rebellion in late September, with the participation of two local British consuls in instigating it. The province is the oil field area of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The rebels demanded "autonomy" for Fars province and the reorganization of the Sultani cabinet, and quickly occupied the important oil outlet city of Bushehr and Shiraz, the capital of Fars province. Because the government army generals intentionally delayed action and did not effectively fight the rebels, the Tehran government signed a ceasefire agreement with the rebels on the 17th, stipulating that a provincial and county council be established in Fars province, and that officials in the province be elected locally; thus, making the province a British colony. Therefore, Sultani reorganized his cabinet on the 19th.

　　伊朗政局有新变化
    左翼群众党三部长辞职
    【新华社延安二十三日电】综合各方报导：伊朗政局最近有新变化，苏尔坦尼内阁已于十九日改组，左翼群众党的三位部长辞职，较开明的宣传部长弗鲁兹亲王亦被调任驻苏大使。群众党中央委员会于同日发表声明，抨击此次改组，宣言“将继续为民主而奋斗”。德黑兰“中蒂芬特”报指出：群众党三部长之辞职，乃因该党与苏尔坦尼间对法尔斯省反动派叛乱之态度对民主党（苏尔坦尼为其领袖）垄断选举委员会等问题上意见分歧。此次苏尔坦尼改组其内阁，据合众社记者称：系对南部法尔斯省叛族之妥协，缘该省加什盖族于九月下旬发生叛乱，当地两位英国领事参与策动。该省为英伊石油公司的油田区，叛族要求法尔斯省“自治”及苏尔坦尼内阁改组，并很快的占领了重要的石油出海口布什尔城及该法尔斯省省会西拉兹，因政府军的将领有意延缓行动，且并未对叛军有效作战，德黑兰政府于十七日与叛族订立停战协定，规定法尔斯省成立省县议会，该省官员由当地选举；从而使该省成了英国的殖民地。因之，苏尔坦尼已于十九日改组其内阁。
