　　The Correspondent Returns
　　Yang Langqiao
　　The vast dusk had already submerged the earth. Battalion Commander × vaguely saw a long string of people moving westward in the fields of Chenyan Village to the east, and ordered the correspondent to immediately contact them. At this time, the battle had just begun, and the battalion commander did not expect that some of Chiang's troops had already begun to flee. Thinking they were his own men, the two young correspondents of the 7th Company—Song Kaifang and Qin Xiaodun—ran towards the group of people with their eyes fixed on them. As the distance gradually closed, they seemed to hear the sound of hooves. They were startled, as if someone had tapped them on the leg, and quickly lay down on the ground: "The 7th Company didn't bring any livestock!" They suspiciously took out four grenades from their waists, pulled the fuses, and waited. The figures were already approaching, and the silhouettes of Chiang's soldiers wearing short jackets and large hats could be seen clearly. The two correspondents did not expect them to sneak away so early in the battle. They immediately threw the grenades over. Surprised by this lightning-fast attack, the Chiang's troops didn't have time to resist. They didn't even open their eyes before turning around and fleeing. The terrified horses threw people off, whinnying as they lunged over the fallen. Both people and horses were trampled in the chaos. Song Kaifang and Qin Xiaodun jumped up from the ground like balls, rushing forward courageously. They didn't realize that there were only two of them, and they had already used up their grenades, while the enemy was a large group with ample weapons. They didn't even think that the battalion commander and political instructor were anxiously waiting for them at this time. They were extremely excited to encounter such a rare opportunity to charge, and were determined to seize a machine gun, so they rushed forward regardless. They didn't want the backpacks discarded along the way, nor did they want the livestock running by the field, snorting through their noses. Song Kaifang had just picked up a rifle from the road and slung it over his back, when Qin Xiaodun had already run ahead alone. Qin Xiaodun pounced like a hungry little tiger, hugging a burly Chiang soldier from behind. But he was carried off the ground by this Chiang soldier, and thrown around in the air. He held on tightly, biting the man's back with his teeth, hugging his legs with his feet, and pressing forward with all his might. With a thud, he pressed the Chiang soldier to the ground. At this moment, the corn leaves in the field beside them suddenly rustled. Xiaodun panicked. He loosened his grip and was swept off his back by the Chiang soldier. Both of them lay on their backs facing the sky. Song Kaifang immediately arrived, pointing his bayonet at the Chiang soldier's stomach: "Surrender your weapon or not?" "Ah! Don't kill me, I'll surrender my weapon. He didn't tell me to surrender just now!" The Chiang soldier was very scared, and seemed to explain with great grievance, releasing the rifle he was holding. "The Eighth Route Army treats prisoners well, who wants to kill you?" Xiaodun shouted from the side and also released his grip. Xiaodun stood up, knowing that there were people in the field, and pretended to say he needed to relieve himself, then walked around and entered the gully field. At this time, a Chiang soldier whose waist had been injured by a kick from a horse was hiding in the gully field, not even daring to breathe. He thought no one had noticed him. Qin Xiaodun tiptoed up to him, suddenly grabbed him by the neck, and dragged out a machine gun he had hidden at the edge of the field. Song Kaifang and Qin Xiaodun carried the captured weapons, brought two prisoners, and also obtained five animals on the road (including two mules carrying two loads of bullets), and found the regimental headquarters in the dark. When Battalion Commander × returned and heard the news on the phone, the anger on his face immediately dissipated, and a happy gleam reappeared in his tired eyes.

　　通讯员回来了
    杨朗樵
    苍茫的暮色已经淹盖着大地，×营长隐约看见东边陈堰村的田野间有一长串的人向西蠕动着，便命令通讯员即刻去和他们连络，这时战斗刚开始，营长就未想到蒋军就已有人开始逃窜出来了，还以为是自己的人，第七连两个年青的通讯员——宋开方和秦小墩，放开腿目不转睛的盯着向那群人奔去，距离渐渐近了，迎面仿佛有马蹄声，他们吃了一惊，像是谁在腿上敲了一下，急忙地卧倒在地上：“七连没有带牲口呀！”他们怀疑地从腰里取出四颗手榴弹，拉出了火线等待着，人影已经逼近了，穿短袄戴大帽的蒋军轮廓也看清了，两个通讯员也没有料到战斗刚开始他们就会偷跑的，立刻把手榴弹投放过去，蒋军资上这迅雷不及掩耳的轰击，没有来得及抵抗，甚至连眼也没瞪就扭头飞跑起来，惊恐的马把人也翻下，哮着从跌倒的人身上扑过去，人和马都在混乱的践踏着。宋开方和秦小墩像个皮球似的从地上跳起来，勇猛的赶上去，他俩没有想到自己才两个人，并且手榴弹都用完了，而对方则是带有充足武装的一大群。他们甚至没有想到这时营长和教导员正焦急的等待着他们，他俩遇到这样难得的冲锋机会，兴奋极了，决心要夺得一挺机关枪，所以就不顾一切的跑上去了，沿路丢弃的背包他们不要，看见在田边跑着。用鼻子喷着气的牲口也不要，宋开方刚从路上拾起一支步枪背在背下，秦小墩已独自一人跑到前面去了，秦小墩像一只饥饿的小老虎扑上去，从背后抱住一个蒋军大汉，但他却被这个蒋军背得离开地面，在空中乱摔，他死抱住大汉不放，用牙咬他的脊背，用脚抱住他的两条大腿，猛力往前一压，扑通一声，把蒋军压在地上了，这时旁边地里苞谷叶忽然刺啦一响，小墩心内慌起来，一松劲就被那个蒋军扫下背来，两人都仰面朝着天，宋开方立即赶到，刺刀对准蒋军大汉的肚子：“缴枪不缴？”“啊呀！别杀我，我缴枪，他刚才没叫我缴枪呀！”那个蒋军很害怕，又似乎很委曲的解释着，松开了手里握着的步枪。“八路军优待俘虏，谁要杀你？”小墩在一边嚷着也放开了手，小墩站起来，知道地里有人，便装着说要解手，就绕着走进峡谷地里去，这时一个被牲口踢坏了腰的蒋军士兵藏在峡谷地里，连气也不敢出，他还以为别人没发觉他呢，秦小墩蹑手蹑脚的走到跟前，突然一把拉住他的脖子，追出了他藏在地边的一挺机关枪。宋开方和秦小墩扛上缴获的武器，带着两个俘虏，在路上又弄了五匹牲口（其中有两头骡子驮着两驮子弹），黑夜找到了团部。当×营长回去在电话上听到了这个消息时，脸上的恼怒立刻消散了，疲劳的眼睛里重闪着愉快的光彩。
