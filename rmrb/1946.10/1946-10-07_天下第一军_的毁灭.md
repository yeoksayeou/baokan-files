The destruction of the "Number One Army Under Heaven"

　　Chiang Kai-shek personally reorganized, Hu Zongnan personally led, and the American reactionaries meticulously equipped the Chiang army's direct line First Brigade, known as the "Number One Army Under Heaven." They strutted arrogantly on the Linfen-Fushan highway, wanting to complete an "easy" task – eliminating the Fushan Liberated Area.

　　However, the 200,000 soldiers and civilians in this 400-square-kilometer area, with their day and night of fervent effort, had already prepared a grave for the "Number One Army Under Heaven's" warriors, just waiting for them to walk in themselves.

　　　　Chen Yan Annihilation Battle

　　At dusk, the Eighth Route Army swiftly surrounded Chen Yan. After the first bomb exploded in the village, they immediately captured a medical unit of Hu Zongnan's elite troops. At the other end, fierce fighting also began.

　　The arrogant Hu Zongnan troops panicked. Attempting to rely on rocket launchers and American-style heavy machine guns "Sten" submachine guns, they charged wildly to the east, southwest of the village. The Eighth Route Army used captured bombs, machine guns, and small cannons to strike back. Many people fell. Some charged forward, seized a corner of the wall, but were beaten back. Even the rocket launcher was damaged. This force was gradually pushed into alleys and courtyards, but they were deceived and forced by their officers to occupy the rooftops. At this time, the fire from the surrounding rooftops blocked the Eighth Route Army's path of attack.

　　At a distance of more than 20 meters from the headquarters of Hu Zongnan's First Regiment, more than a dozen of our Second Company soldiers moved towards this regimental headquarters in a sparse skirmish line. It was very difficult to pass through this fierce artillery fire. Clever combatants advanced along latrines and cattle pen walls, continuously firing at the rooftops and alleys. An enemy machine gun on the wall of the west courtyard was immediately silenced. The firepower on the rooftops to the east, north, and south fiercely blocked the roads and alley entrances. The fire illuminated the intersections and alley entrances very clearly.

　　Combatant Yang Wenzhi, a young and brave lad, carrying a rifle and bombs, broke free from the squad leader's hand and jumped into this fire net. At this time, the fire was concentrated on Yang Wenzhi. We could see Yang Wenzhi advancing up and down. Suddenly, he fell to the ground. The people behind him shouted anxiously, wanting to rush over. A large piece of flesh was knocked off Yang Wenzhi's foot by something, which was very painful, but he didn't care. He just gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and continued crawling forward with all his strength. On the ground, a bloodstain was drawn as his foot moved. The people behind him cheered happily and followed him crawling forward. Yang Wenzhi crawled to the base of the wall and stood up. He found a suitable position and continuously threw bombs out. The enemies on the south and west rooftops groaned and rolled down. Yang Wenzhi's people rushed up and quickly dug holes in the wall.

　　The enemies on the east rooftop panicked. A commander was shouting and cursing: "Damn it, fire, fire, fire!..." Then the firepower on the east rooftop fired frantically again. But at this time, the soldiers who had dug holes in the wall had already swept them with machine guns. There was a popping sound on the rooftop, and the commander who was shouting and cursing fell heavily from the rooftop. The rest all put down their "Sten" submachine guns and knelt down begging for mercy…

　　Fighting was still going on fiercely elsewhere. This was a large courtyard built of blue bricks. The Hu army guarding this courtyard also concentrated all its weapons and fired at the attacking Eighth Route Army. The Sixth Company erected ladders several times, but the upper half of the ladder had just reached the hole in the wall, and the hole was blocked by firepower. At this time, the artillery arrived, pulled out a mountain gun, and fired a shot. The north house of the large courtyard immediately collapsed. The Sixth Company took the opportunity to climb onto the ruins of the north house, seize a rooftop, and then fire another shot, seizing another rooftop. Continuing to fight, they drove all the Hu army on the rooftops down to the courtyard. We followed them down to the courtyard and finally drove these people into the house. Only then did we call out:

　　"Lay down your weapons! Don't be deceived by your officers! Surrender and you will not be killed!"

　　"Chinese should not fight Chinese!"... At this time, hundreds of soldiers of the "Number One Army Under Heaven" came out of the house. Lieutenant General Huang Zhengcheng was also mixed in, wearing a soldier's tattered jacket on his upper body, and his lower body was hit so quickly that he didn't have time to change, and he was still wearing his original handsome general's riding breeches…

　　　　Automatically shouting: Long Live the Communist Party!

　　At night, the Eighth Route Army began to deal with the Hu Zongnan troops in Guanque Village. It was already past midnight. The Sixth Company destroyed three bunkers and was stopped in front of the fourth bunker. The company commander gritted his teeth and led the troops to charge forward. A flare was fired from the hidden bunker, and then American heavy machine gun bullets scattered like handfuls.

　　One, two, three charges were all blocked by the firepower of the hidden bunker. The company commander said: "Go! We must take it down!" The fourth charge began again.

　　Under the cover of dense machine gun fire, bursts of white smoke from the bombs rose, and they jumped forward from the white smoke. Some were injured, fell to the ground, and then got up again, throwing the last bomb. Step by step they approached the dark bunker. Lao Zhang threw a bomb into the gun hole. The dark bunker shook rumblingly and collapsed. The battle outside the village ended.

　　The battle moved into Guanque Village, where fierce fighting was everywhere. Flames and flares burned Guanque Village brightly. In the firelight, one chased another, and groups chased groups forward!

　　The Seventh Company passed through fierce artillery fire and stopped in front of a large courtyard. The courtyard was very high, about three zhang (approx. 10 meters) high, with large buildings on three sides and a large gate on one side. Hu Zongnan's troops were firing at the Eighth Route Army on the street corner from inside. Ma Guanqun, Wang Chuncheng, and Wang Jilin of the Tenth Squad quickly groped forward and erected a ladder against the courtyard wall. Little devil Li Qiudong rushed up first, followed by Wu Zhanbiao. The clever combatants had already dug several gun holes in the courtyard wall, extending their firepower and blocking the doors and windows of the three large buildings. Little devil Li Qiudong stood on the wall and saw several cannons in the courtyard at a glance. He didn't have time to call others, so he quickly jumped down, and the people behind him followed him down. The large buildings were desperately firing, but how inaccurate, shooting at the window opposite. Li Qiudong walked over, grabbed the cannon barrel, and shouted, "Cannon! Cannon..."

　　When Hu Zongnan's troops on the large buildings fired again, someone had already opened the gate, and one by one they jumped into the courtyard. As soon as they concentrated their firepower on the buildings, someone above shouted "Surrender!" Hu Zongnan's artillery company commander came out respectfully and said, "We are old soldiers, from humble backgrounds, and we didn't want to fight in the civil war long ago. Now... now we hand over this rocket launcher to you, and also the anti-tank guns."

　　Soon it dawned, and the artillery fire gradually subsided, but the bloody battle was still going on.

　　Guanque Village had already been recovered by half. Hu Zongnan's regimental headquarters was trapped in three large courtyards. The Second Battalion dared not show its face in the first floor courtyard. They had become bees in a jar.

　　At dusk, the second attack was launched. Firepower was used within the four courtyards to block all passable roads. The Eighth Company organized two grenade-throwing groups to advance. Clusters of white smoke led groups of people to charge forward one after another. At this time, it was impossible to tell whose firepower it was. Bullets flew on the roofs, under the roofs, on the streets, and in the alleys. The bricks and tiles and doors and windows on the roofs fell in the firelight. The Eighth Route Army jumped, crouched, and jumped forward in this flashing firelight.

　　The Eighth Company had approached the large courtyard. Sappers skillfully buried explosives at the base of the large courtyard wall. Inside, there was a commander cursing and deceiving the soldiers: "Don't be afraid, charge forward! The Eighth Route Army only has elm-wood cannons, charge forward, charge forward..." But before he could finish speaking, the large courtyard swayed from the base of the wall and immediately exploded a gap. The people of the Eighth Company charged into the courtyard one after another. The firepower of the "Sten" submachine gun on the north building blocked the gap again, but the Eighth Company, which had rushed into the courtyard, had quietly erected a ladder on the north building. Several combatants rushed up and stuffed bombs into the window holes. Those outside the courtyard bombarded with small cannons. The north building burned in the bombing. There was a commotion inside, and someone came out strangely to report:

　　"Regimental commander, injured, regimental commander, injured."

　　Hundreds of soldiers came out and surrendered their weapons.

　　After fierce fighting in the large building courtyard of Hu Jun's Second Battalion, Battalion Commander ×× led his subordinates, raised his hands and surrendered to the Eighth Route Army, and shouted sincerely:

　　"Long live the Communist Party!"

　　His 180 subordinates also shouted loudly:

　　"Long live the Communist Party! Long live the Communist Party!"

　　Battalion Commander Li then introduced himself as the battalion commander, and the deputy battalion commander also introduced himself. They counted and surrendered two American heavy machine guns, eight light machine guns, thirteen "Sten" submachine guns, more than one hundred rifles, and one hundred and eighty soldiers. They said as if they had gotten rid of a burden: "Please check and accept."

　　　　Put in the History Museum

　　From 10:00 a.m. on September 24th, the title of "Number One Army Under Heaven" should be placed in the history museum. Let the reactionaries cry sadly!

### “天下第一军”的毁灭

　　“天下第一军”的毁灭
    蒋介石亲自整编、胡宗南亲自带领、美国反动派精心装备的，号称为“天下第一军”的蒋军嫡系第一旅，威风凛凛，傲慢骄纵地在临（汾）浮（山）公路上横冲直撞，他们想要完成一个“轻而易举”的任务——消灭浮山解放区。
    但是，这四百平方公里上的二十万军民，用夜以继日的狂热努力，已经替“天下第一军”的勇士们准备好了坟墓，只静候他们自己走来了。
        陈堰歼灭战
    黄昏，八路军神速的包围了陈堰，在村里响起第一个炸弹后，马上就缴获了胡宗南精锐军队的一个卫生部，在另一端，也开始了激烈的战斗。
    傲慢的胡宗南军惊慌了。企图凭借火箭炮、美式重机枪的“斯登”手提式，向村东和村西南乱突乱撞，八路军使用着缴获的炸弹、机枪、小炮打过去，不少的人们倒下去了，有些人冲过来，夺取了一个墙角，但又被打回去，连火箭炮也被炸伤了，这支队伍便逐渐被压进巷子、院子，可是又被他们的官长欺骗、强迫，而占据了房顶。这时四周围房顶上的火力封锁了八路军攻击的道路。
    在距离胡宗南第一团团部二十余米达的地方，我们的二连十多个战士以稀疏的散兵线，向着这个团部运动，穿过这激烈的炮火，是非常困难的，聪明的战斗员沿着茅厕，牛栏墙根前进，向房顶和巷子接连射击。西院子墙上敌人的一挺机枪立刻打哑了，东南北三面房顶上的火力，又激烈封锁着道路和巷口，火光把路口巷口照耀得很清楚。
    战斗员杨文治，年轻勇敢的小伙子，提着步枪，炸弹，挣开了班长的手，一跳就跳进这个火网去，这时火力集中射击着杨文治，我们可以看到杨文治一起一伏的前进着。忽然，他倒在了地上，后面的人着急地叫着，要冲过去。杨文治脚上被不知什么东西打掉了一大块肉，非常痛，但是他不管，只是咬着牙闭着眼睛用全力继续向前爬行。在地上，随着他脚的移动，画出了一条血痕，后面的人高兴得欢叫起来，也跟着向前爬行。杨文治爬到墙根，站起来了，他找到了适当的地位，接连不断的把炸弹投出去，南房西房上的敌人，随即呻吟着滚下去了。杨文治后面的人抢上来，在墙上迅速地掏洞。
    东房顶上的敌人惊慌起来了，有一位指挥官在叫骂着：“妈的个×，打，打，打！……”于是东房顶上的火力又疯狂的射击着。但这时掏开墙洞的战士已经用机枪扫射过去了，房顶上朴朴的响着，那位叫骂着的指挥官就从房顶上沉重的滚下去了。其余的人就都放下“斯登”手提式，跪着求命开恩……。
    别处战斗仍在激烈的进行着。这是一所青砖砌成的大院子，守着这院子的胡军，同样集中了所有的武器，向着进攻的八路军射击，六连几次竖起梯子，但梯子的上半截刚掏开墙洞，洞口又被火力封锁住了。这时炮兵赶过来，拉开山炮轰了一炮，大院子的北房立刻就塌下去，六连乘机攀上北房的残垣，夺下一个房顶，再轰一炮，又夺了一个，接着打过去，把所有房上的胡军都赶下院子去，我们又跟追下院子去，最后把这些人打进了房子，这才进行了喊话：
    “缴枪！不要受你们官长欺骗！缴枪过来不杀！”
    “中国人不打中国人！”……这时屋子里走出几百个“天下第一军”的士兵来。中将黄正成也混杂在里面，上身穿着兵士的破烂袄子，下身被打得来不及改换，还穿着原来漂亮的将军马裤……。
            自动高呼：共产党万岁！
    夜晚，八路军开始解决官雀村的胡宗南军。已经有半夜，第六连摧毁了三个碉堡，又被阻止在第四个碉堡跟前。连长咬着牙，带着部队冲过去，从暗碉堡射出了照明弹，接着，美国重机枪子弹就一把一把撒过来。
    一次，二次，三次的冲锋，都被暗碉堡的火力阻击回来，连长说：“走！非攻下来不可！”第四次冲锋又开始了。
    在密集的机枪掩护下，一阵阵炸弹的白烟升起，他们就从白烟中跃进，有的受伤了，倒在地上，又爬起来，投出最后一颗炸弹。一步一步的接近暗堡了，老张从枪眼中投进炸弹去，暗堡轰隆隆的摇动着，倒塌下去了。村外的战斗结束了。
    战斗移到官雀村里，到处在激烈的战斗着，火焰与照明弹，烧得官雀村通亮，在火光中，一个追一个，一群追一群前进！
    七连穿过猛烈的炮火，在一个大院子前停下，院子很高，约有三丈多，三面大楼房，一面大门。胡宗南的部队从里面向街上墙角的八路军射击着。十班的马冠群、王春成、王吉林很快的摸过去，在院墙上竖起梯子，小鬼李秋东抢先上去，接着吴占彪也上去了。聪明的战斗员，已在院墙上掏了几个枪眼，伸进了火力，封锁住三面大楼的门窗。小鬼李秋东站在墙上，一眼看到院里放了几门炮，也来不及招呼别人，就赶快跳下去，后面的人也跟着下去。大楼上拚命放着枪，可是多么不准确，射击在面对面的楼窗上了。李秋东走过去，扶着炮筒大叫起来，“大炮！大炮……”
    大楼上的胡宗南军又一阵射击时，已有人把大门打开，一个个跳进院子来，刚一集中火力向楼房上射击，上面就有人叫“投降”了。胡宗南的炮兵连长，走出来恭恭敬敬的说：“咱是老粗，行伍出身，早不愿打内战，现在……现在这火箭炮交给你们，还有战防炮。”
    一会儿就天明了，炮火渐渐停息下去，但血腥的战斗仍然进行着。
    官雀村已经收复了一半，胡宗南的团部困守在三座大院子里，第二营在一楼院里不敢露面，他们已成了瓮中之嗡。
    黄昏，第二次的攻击发动了。四个院子内开始用火力封锁住一切可通行的道路，八连组织了两个投弹组前进，一朵朵的白烟引着一群群人接连冲过去了，在这个时候分不清是谁家的火力，房上房下街上巷口飞着子弹，跳着子弹，房上的砖瓦和门窗在火光中掉落下来，八路军就在这火光一闪一闪中跳着伏着的跳过去了。
    八连已经接近大院子，工兵敏捷地在大院子墙根下埋炸药，里面隐约传来有个指挥官在叫骂欺骗着士兵：“不怕，冲过去！八路军只有榆木土炮，冲过去，冲过去……”可是话还没有说完，大院子从墙根摇摆起来，立刻炸开一个缺口。八连的人就一个跟一个冲进院子，北楼上的“斯登”手提机枪的火力又堵住缺口，可是冲进院子里的八连，已经在北楼上悄悄的树起一架梯子，几个战斗员急步上去，从窗洞里塞进炸弹，院外的又用小炮轰击，北楼在轰炸声中烧起来了。里面振动起来，有人奇怪地出来报告：
    “团长，打伤了，团长，打伤了。”
    几百个士兵走出来缴了枪。
    胡军第二营的大楼院同时经过激烈的战斗后，营长××就带着自己的部下举起手向八路军投降，并且诚心诚意的高呼着：
    “共产党万岁！”
    他的部下一百八十个人也跟着高声叫喊：
    “共产党万岁！共产党万岁！”
    李营长随后介绍自己是营长，副营长也作了自我介绍。他们点缴了美国竽机枪两挺，轻机枪八挺，“斯登”手提式十三挺，步枪百余支，和士兵一百八十人。他们像摆脱了负担似的说：“请你们查收。”
            放进历史博物馆
    从九月二十四日上午十时起，“天下第一军”的称号该放进历史博物馆里去了，让反动派伤心的去痛哭吧！
