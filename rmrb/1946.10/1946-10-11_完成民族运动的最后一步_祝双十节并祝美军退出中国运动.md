　　Completing the Final Step of the National Movement
    Celebrating the Double Tenth Festival and the Movement for the Withdrawal of US Troops from China
    Thirty-five years ago, China experienced the Xinhai Revolution, a dual national movement that overthrew the autocratic rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, which was also the overthrow of the rule of the imperialist running dogs. This movement did not truly and thoroughly complete its mission, but its direct goal was still achieved. Although the Manchu Qing imperial family had established a 267-year “orthodoxy,” using the most cruel suppression tactics against the resistance of the Han and other ethnic groups, with the recognition and assistance of the imperialist powers externally, and the support of Han traitors from Wu Sangui and Hong Chengchou to Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and Yuan Shikai internally, it rapidly collapsed in the end. The victory belonged to the people who were cursed as "bandits" and "rebels" by the Manchus. The celebration of the Double Tenth Festival will forever strengthen our confidence: all invaders of the Chinese nation and their running dogs are bound to fail, and China's movement for independence and freedom is bound to succeed. In the thirty-five years since the Xinhai Revolution, our country has experienced many twists and turns, especially the arrival of Japanese imperialism and the emergence of a great traitor, Wang Jingwei. Japan was more "powerful" than the Manchus, but more unlucky than the Manchus. From the "September 18th Incident" onwards, Japan occupied part of China's territory, but was overthrown after fourteen years. This was because the awareness and unity of the Chinese people at this time were many times stronger than in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties and the late Qing and early Republic of China. Most importantly, the Chinese Communist Party, the mainstay of the nation, emerged. After Japan was overthrown, American imperialism came along, occupying many of our fortresses, invading our airspace and inland rivers, controlling our diplomacy, military, economy, and transportation, and forcing the Chinese people to accept Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and civil war, in order to turn China into a complete American colony. The American aggressors say that they did not invade China, but were invited into China by Chiang Kai-shek. But the Manchu Tartars were "invited" by Wu Sangui, and Japan was "invited" by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei successively. Which aggressor cannot find a few national scum to act as adopted sons? The American aggressors also say that they did not use war to invade. In this respect, the aggressors seem to have indeed "progressed." The Manchus invaded and made themselves emperors, but when Japan invaded, it maintained a "Wang regime" with "complete territorial sovereignty," and even "abolished" the unequal treaties. And American imperialism? It doesn't even need to fight, it just walks in. This "progress" is of course because the traitors are becoming more and more shameless, shamelessly loyal and in sync, but the main reason is that the strength of the people is increasing, and the aggressors' scruples have to use more subtle methods.
    In reality, each generation of aggressors is worse than the last, the people's power is stronger, and the aggressors are more isolated. The Manchus had the support of the imperialist powers, Japan had the support of Britain, the United States, and Germany and Italy, but the current American aggressors cannot get support internationally or domestically. They have only invaded China for a year, and the opposition from the Chinese people, the American people, and the people of the world is so strong that it even surpasses the movement against Japanese aggression during the September 18th Incident. The movement for the withdrawal of US troops from China, initiated in the United States, spread to Shanghai last month, adding the demand that the US government stop all aid to Chiang. Today, it has spread to the Liberated Areas, adding the demand that Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops withdraw from all occupied areas. The lifespan of the Japanese aggressors and their running dogs in China was shorter than that of the Manchus and their running dogs, and the lifespan of the American aggressors and their running dogs will definitely be shorter. Two hundred and sixty-seven years of anti-Manchu struggle overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty and produced a nominal, sham republic. Eight years of resistance against Japan overthrew Japanese imperialism, resulting in half a sham victory (the KMT-controlled areas) and half a true victory (the Liberated Areas). The current struggle to demand the withdrawal of US troops from China and the withdrawal of Chiang's troops from the occupied areas will surely achieve more rapid and greater results. At that time, our country will defeat the last foreign aggressor and finally enjoy national independence and freedom. Patriotic compatriots across the country, advance resolutely and bravely towards a bright future with the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution and the War of Resistance!

### 完成民族运动的最后一步  祝双十节并祝美军退出中国运动

　　完成民族运动的最后一步
    祝双十节并祝美军退出中国运动
    三十五年以前，我国爆发了辛亥革命，这是两重的民族运动，推翻满清君主专制，亦即推翻帝国主义走狗的统治。这个运动未真正彻底完成使命，但直接目的还是达到了。满清皇室虽然建立了二百六十七年的“正统”，对汉族和其他民族的反抗极尽惨酷镇压之能事，外有帝国主义列强的承认和援助，内有从吴三桂洪承畴到曾国潘、李鸿章、袁世凯等汉奸的拥护，但在最后却迅速土崩瓦解，胜利的乃是被满清咒骂为“匪类”“乱党”的人民。双十节的庆祝，永远坚定我们的信心，中华民族的一切侵略者及其走狗必然失败，而中国的独立自由运动必然胜利。辛亥革命至今的三十五年间，我国又经历了许多曲折，特别是来了日本帝国主义和出了一个大汉奸汪精卫。日本比满清更“强大”，却比满清更倒霉，从“九一八”时起，日本侵占了我国一部分领土，在十四年后就被打倒了。因为这时我国人民的觉悟和团结，比明末清初和清末民初加强了不知多少倍，最重要的是出了一个民族的中坚中国共产党。日本打倒了之后，又来了一个美帝国主义，霸占了我们许多要塞，侵略了我们的领空和内河，控制了我们的外交军事经济交通，并强迫我国人民接受蒋介石的独裁和内战，以便使中国沦为完全的美国殖民地。美国侵略者说：他们不是侵入中国，是被蒋介石请入中国的，但是满清鞑子是吴三桂“请”来，日本是蒋介石汪精卫先后“请”来，那个侵略者找不到个把民族败类做干儿子呢？美国侵略者又说：他没有用战争来侵略，在这一点上，侵略者似乎确实“进步”。满清打进来自己做了皇帝，日本打进来却维持了一个“领土主权完整”的“汪政权”，还“废除”了不平等条约。美帝国主义呢？打都用不着打，简直走进来就是了。这个“进步”固然因为汉奸越来越无耻，无耻得十分忠实，十分合拍的地步，但是主要的却还是人民的力量越来越增加了，侵略者的顾忌不得不用更巧妙的手法。
    侵略者实际上是一代不如一代，人民力量更强大了，而侵略者更孤立了。满清曾得到帝国主义列强的支持，日本曾得到英美与德意的支持，现在的美国侵略者，却在国际国内都得不到支持。他们侵入中国才一年，而中国人民美国人民和世界人民的反对，其声势之壮，比之九一八时的反对日本侵略的运动竟有过之而无不及。美军退出中国运动，由美国本地发起，上月传入上海，在内容上增加了要求美国政府停止一切援蒋活动，今天又传入解放区，其内容又加上了要求蒋介石侵略军退出一切侵占区，日本侵略者及其走狗在中国的寿命，比满清及其走狗的寿命短，而美国侵略者及其走狗的寿命，一定更短。二百六十七天的反满斗争，打倒了满清产生了一个有名无实的假民国。八年抗战打倒了日本帝国主义，产生了一半假胜利（蒋管区）和一半真胜利（解放区）。目前的要求美军退出中国蒋军退出侵占区的奋斗，一定会得到更迅速更伟大的结果。那时我国将战胜最后的外国侵略者，最后享受到民族的独立自由。全国的爱国同胞，用辛亥和抗战的精神向着光明的前途坚决勇猛前进啊！
