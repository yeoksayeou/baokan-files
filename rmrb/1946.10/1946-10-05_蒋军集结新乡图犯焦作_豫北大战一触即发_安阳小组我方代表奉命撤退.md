　　Chiang Troops Gather in Xinxiang, Plotting to Invade Jiaozuo
    A Major Battle in Northern Henan Imminent
    Our Representative of the Anyang Group Ordered to Withdraw
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 3rd dispatch] The Kuomintang Central News Agency's continuous military broadcasts attacking Cixian are covering up a military conspiracy, which is an important step by Chiang Kai-shek's war-mongering clique to expand the civil war. Its specific plan attempts to seize the Daokou-Qinghua Railway controlled by the Eighth Route Army, and occupy our famous Jiaozuo mining area and important northern Henan towns such as Bo'ai and Qinyang, in order to further control northern Henan and a powerful base for another attack on my Pinghan Railway. According to information obtained by our reporter: Chiang's military offensive deployment is actively underway, with the main force mostly concentrated in Xinxiang, in order to break into Jiaozuo at any time. At present, in the vicinity of Xinxiang, in addition to Chiang's 85th Division, Chiang's 10th Heavy Artillery Regiment and 75th Infantry Division have been transferred from the Kaocheng area of ​​Hebei, Shandong and Henan to Xinxiang. The remnants of Chiang's 41st Division, which attacked Dongming, are also heading west to Xinxiang via Changyuan and Fengqiu. Chiang's 66th Division on the south bank of the Yellow River is also ordered to cross north. In addition, in order to cooperate with the offensive on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the 40th Division stationed in Anyang is also preparing to attack north of Anyang at the same time. Currently, Chiang's army is gathering heavily near Xinxiang, and a major battle in northern Henan is imminent. The army and people in our northern Henan liberated areas are stepping up preparations to give the invaders a double counterattack.
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 3rd dispatch] Our representative of the Anyang Group was ordered to withdraw by the three members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters. Representative Ma Shian led his staff and returned to Handan on the 2nd.

    【本报邯郸三日电】国民党中央社连日进攻磁县的军事广播，正掩盖着一个军事阴谋，这阴谋是蒋介石好战集团扩大内战的重要步骤之一。其具体计划企图夺取八路军控制下的道清线，侵占我著名焦作矿区及博爱沁阳等豫北重镇，以便进而控制豫北，和再一次进攻我平汉的有力基地。据本报记者获悉：蒋军此项进攻部署正在积极进行，其主力大部集结于新乡，以便向焦作随时突进。目前新乡附近除蒋军八十五师外，蒋军重炮第十团，步兵七十五师，均已由冀鲁豫考城地区调来新乡，进攻东明的蒋军四十一师残部，也正经过长垣封邱向新乡西开，黄河南岸蒋军六十六师也正奉命北渡，此外为配合道清方面的进攻，驻安阳的四十师也准备同时向我安阳以北进攻，现新乡附近，蒋军大军云集，豫北大战一触即发，我豫北解放区军民正加紧准备，将予进犯者以加倍的反击。
    【本报邯郸三日电】安阳小组我方代表奉北平执行部三委员命令撤退，马代表适安率员于二日返抵邯郸。
