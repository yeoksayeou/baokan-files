　　Taihang Administrative Office Issues Winter Study Instructions
    Implement Current Affairs, Emancipation, and Production Education
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 29th] To ensure the victory of the self-defense war and make early ideological preparations for various winter tasks, the Taihang Administrative Office has issued instructions for this year's winter study movement. It states in brief: This year, in addition to literacy and eliminating illiteracy, winter study should focus on current affairs, emancipation, and production education, with current affairs education as the main focus. Combined with the experiences and actual lives of the masses in different regions, it should inspire them to understand the current and future political situation and the direction of the struggle. The three types of education should be combined, but there should be a focus in different regions, that is, in the old areas, combined with participation in the war mobilization education, mobilize the masses to conduct emancipation reviews, inspire their enthusiasm for defending their vested interests, and at the same time, clear their minds through policy education, so as to develop winter production and cooperative undertakings. In the new areas, the focus should be on enlightening the political consciousness of the masses, using the comparison between the old and new societies to educate them to defend the new society. In the cities, the focus should be on education on industrial and commercial policies. The instructions stipulate that winter study should start from November 15th and end on March 15th of next year. The period before November 15th is the preparation period, and each county should immediately hire and train voluntary teachers, prepare teaching materials, and mobilize villages to summarize the experience of past winter studies. November 15th to January 17th of next year is the period for current affairs and emancipation education, and after the 17th, it will turn to supporting the army education. After the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, it will turn to production education.
