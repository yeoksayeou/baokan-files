　　Comrade Nie Zhen's Speech Points Out:
    Only by Thoroughly Mobilizing the Masses
    Can We Do a Good Job in War Preparedness
    At the last day of the meeting, Comrade Nie Zhen of the Central Bureau provided extremely detailed opinions on the issue of combining current war preparedness with mass mobilization. The main points are as follows:
    Comrade Nie Zhen first pointed out: Only by thoroughly mobilizing the masses, achieving "land to the tiller," can we effectively organize the masses, rely on the masses, do a good job in war preparedness, and truly launch a mass-based guerrilla war to defend the fruits of victory. Now that we have defeated the "small Chiang Kai-shek" in various villages, we must also defeat the "big Chiang Kai-shek." Therefore, our war preparedness must be carried out on the basis of thoroughly realizing "land to the tiller."
    Next, Comrade Nie Zhen put forward the working principles for mobilizing the masses in the current tense war preparedness situation: In areas where the land reform movement of "land to the tiller" has been largely implemented, and where the large-scale development stage has been largely completed, such as the second district of Handan, Wu'an, and Cixian, we should shift to in-depth movements, conduct a thorough examination of the emancipation, implement filling in gaps and making up deficiencies, and thoroughly mobilize the masses. From this, put forward active slogans, mobilize the masses to defend the interests of emancipation, and carry out war preparedness. As for areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, in war preparedness, we should still focus on resolutely mobilizing the masses and strive to satisfy the masses' demand for "land to the tiller" before the arrival of the war, to create a mass base for future guerrilla warfare. However, in the process of the movement, special attention should be paid to uniting more than 90% of the masses. The key to doing this well lies in being good at uniting the middle peasants. In terms of working methods, adopt a "one-package struggle" to accomplish everything in one go, quickly and well. The fruits of the mass struggle should also be seized and quickly distributed. In the border areas, the main task is to use the militia to conduct counter-espionage and counter-traitor activities, disarm the landlords and reactionaries, and arm ourselves. Generally, implement rent and interest reduction; however, under suitable circumstances, "land to the tiller" can also be implemented. In these areas, we should mainly concentrate our forces on striking at the traitors, spies, despots, and landlords hated by the masses, and pay more attention to uniting the majority of the work.
    Regarding the methods of war preparedness, Comrade Nie Zhen pointed out: 1. Propaganda and mobilization should be open, universal, and in-depth, with repeated inspections and explanations, and mobilization slogans should be put forward from a positive perspective. (Such as "Everyone rise up and struggle!" "Overthrow the traitorous landlords and Chiang Kai-shek!" "Defend the fruits of the masses' emancipation!" etc.) Cadres and the masses should understand the nature, laws, and characteristics of the war, explain our favorable conditions and the inevitable defeat of the Chiang army, thoroughly shatter any illusions of cadres and the masses about the US-Chiang reactionaries, and strengthen the belief in comprehensive resistance. In terms of mobilization methods, first, break through the thinking of cadres, and then mobilize the masses. 2. Quickly reorganize the militia, establish guerrilla groups to form a coordinated defense between guerrilla teams, armed work teams, and the militia. In war preparedness work, leadership should avoid egalitarianism and should have priorities, distinguishing between urgent and less urgent matters. The most important thing is armament, and the militia should be quickly reformed, active militia members and cadres should be trained, politically experienced backbones should be equipped, and county, district, and village headquarters should be established to achieve unified leadership. In areas where guerrilla warfare is frequently conducted, the militia should also combine combat with production. 3. Strengthen anti-espionage work. Resolutely suppress armed spies, gunmen, and important elements who incite or attempt to incite riots, while generally adopting a policy of striving for leniency towards ordinary members of espionage organizations, encouraging them to confess and turn over a new leaf to eliminate their organizations. All of the above should expose their crimes to educate the masses. Finally, Comrade Nie Zhen also gave a detailed explanation of how to work if the Chiang army temporarily occupies villages.

　　聂真同志发言指出
    只有彻底发动群众
    才能做好备战工作
    在最后一天的会议上，中央局聂真同志对目前备战与发动群众的结合问题提供了极为详尽的意见。要点如下：
    聂真同志首先指出：只有彻底发动了群众，达到了耕者有其田，才能很好的组织群众，依靠群众，作好备战工作，才能真正展开群众性的游击战争，保卫胜利果实。现在各村打败了小蒋介石，还要打败大蒋介石才行。因此，我们的备战，必须在彻底实现耕者有其田的基础上去进行。
    接着聂真同志提出了在目前紧张备战情况下，我们发动群众的工作方针：在耕者有其田的土地改革运动已大部实行的地区，大发展阶段已差不多完成的地方，如邯郸二区武安磁县等地，就应转向深入的运动中，进行翻身大检查，实行填平补齐，贯彻放手发动群众。从中提出积极的口号，动员群众保卫翻身利益，进行备战。至于还未实行土地改革的地区，在备战中，仍应以坚决发动群众为主，尽量争取在战争到来以前满足群众耕者有其田的要求，以造成将来游击战的群众基础。但在运动进行中要特别注意团结百分之九十以上的群众。要做好这一点，其关键就在善于团结中农。在工作方法上，采取一揽子斗争，一气呵成；来得既快又好。群众斗争的果实，也应抓紧迅速的分配。在边沿区，主要是掌握民兵武装进行反奸反特，解除地主反动派的武装来武装自己。一般的实行减租减息；但在情况许可的条件下，亦可实行耕者有其田。在这些地区，主要要集中力量打击群众所痛恨的汉奸特务恶霸地主，多注意团结大多数的工作。
    关于备战工作的作法，聂真同志指出：一、宣传动员时，要公开普遍和深入，要反复检查和解释，要从积极方面提出动员口号。（如“大家起来斗争！”“打垮汉奸大地主蒋介石！”“保卫群众的翻身果实！”等。）要使干部群众了解战争的性质规律与特点，说明我们的有利条件与蒋军必败，要彻底粉碎干部群众对美蒋反动派的任何幻想，加强全面抵抗的信念。在动员的方式上，采取先打通干部思想，再动员群众。二、迅速整理民兵，建立游击集团形成游击队武工队与民兵的联村联防的互相配合。在备战工作中，领导上切忌平均主义，要有重点，分缓急。最重要的是武装，应迅速改造民兵，集训民兵积极分子和干部，配备政治上有经验的骨干，并建立县区村指挥部，切实做到一元化领导。在游击战争经常进行的地区，民兵还要实行战斗与生产结合。三、加强除奸工作。对于武装特务、黑枪手、暴动和企图暴动的重要分子必须坚决予以镇压，对特务组织中的一般分子则应多采取争取宽大，使其坦白自新，消灭其组织。以上并皆应揭破其罪恶以教育群众。最后聂真同志对蒋军可能暂时侵占村庄应如何工作，也作了详细的说明。
