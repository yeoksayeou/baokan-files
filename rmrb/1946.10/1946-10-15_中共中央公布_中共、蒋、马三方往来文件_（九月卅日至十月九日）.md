Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 11th. The CPC Central Committee has recently released the documents exchanged among the CPC, Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshall from September 30th to October 9th as follows:

(I) Memorandum from the CPC Delegation to Chiang Kai-shek and Marshall on September 30th

Respectfully, since the suspension of the ceasefire negotiations in June, the government has further disregarded all constraints and torn up the January Truce Agreement, launching large-scale offensives in the interior. In these three months, government troops have occupied many cities in the Liberated Areas, destroyed popularly elected governments in many places, and bombed the Liberated Areas wildly, harming the lives and property of countless residents. Furthermore, it put forward unreasonable five demands, forcing the CPC troops and popularly elected local governments to withdraw from certain areas; when the CPC refused to accept based on the provisions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Program, the government intensified its military offensives to achieve its political goals and expand its occupation. Therefore, in addition to occupying a series of places in the Liberated Areas, such as the Central Plains, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Rehe, the government also used the CPC's siege of Datong as an excuse to declare that it would launch an offensive to capture Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Yan'an. Sure enough, government troops soon occupied Chengde and continued to occupy important cities on the Ping-Sui Railway, such as Fengzhen. In fact, the CPC's battle for Datong was only a containment of the Shanxi Yan Xishan's troops' offensive, and belonged to the nature of a siege. Recently, it was officially announced that the siege has been lifted. The threat to Datong no longer exists, but the government troops continue to expand their occupation of Rehe and eastern Hebei without any excuse, and openly launched a three-pronged large-scale offensive against Zhangjiakou. The fact is very clear that the government does not hesitate to attack Zhangjiakou, one of the political and military centers of the CPC Liberated Areas, to force the Kuomintang-CPC relationship to the point of final rupture. Enlai and others are specially ordered to declare: If the government does not immediately stop all military actions against Zhangjiakou and its surroundings, the CPC cannot but believe that the government has publicly declared a complete rupture and abandoned the policy of political settlement from now on. All serious consequences caused by this shall, of course, be entirely borne by the government. This is specially notified.

Respectfully submitted by Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan of the CPC Delegation. September 30, 1946.

(II) Memorandum from Chiang Kai-shek to Marshall on October 2nd

Having received Your Excellency's letter of October 1, 1946, and the letter from General Zhou Enlai of September 30, 1946, delivered to Your Excellency by Mr. Dong Biwu, in order to save time and express its utmost sincerity, the government hereby frankly states its maximum concessions for resolving the current problems.

(1) The Chinese Communist Party has been constantly urging the reorganization of the National Government. The key to this matter lies in the allocation of seats in the National Government Committee. The government had originally agreed to allocate eight seats to the CPC and four seats to the Democratic League, totaling twelve seats. The CPC requested to obtain ten seats for itself and four seats for the Democratic League, totaling fourteen seats. The government now makes a new concession by giving one seat to a non-partisan person recommended by the CPC and agreed by the government. In this way, adding the original twelve seats, there will be a total of thirteen seats, but the CPC should immediately hand over its list of candidates for the National Government Committee and the list of representatives attending the National Assembly. This redistribution of seats should be decided by the proposed three-person group and approved by the PCC Integrated Group. Furthermore, if the troop reduction plan is implemented immediately, the locations of the CPC's eighteen divisions should be determined immediately, and the CPC troops should enter the designated areas according to the agreed date. The above matters should be decided by the three-person meeting and carried out under the supervision of the Executive Headquarters. If the CPC has the sincerity to achieve peace and cooperate with the government, and is willing to immediately resolve the above two issues, then when an agreement is reached, a ceasefire order should be issued by both sides.

Signed by Chiang Kai-shek, October 2, 1946, at the National Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing.

(III) Memorandum from Marshall to Stuart on October 6th

Dr. Stuart: Here is a brief description of the method agreed upon by the President Chiang and me this morning:

Please inform Wang Bingnan that we have suggested to President Chiang a ten-day truce for the offensive against Zhangjiakou under the following conditions:

(1) The purpose of the truce is to implement the two suggestions mentioned in President Chiang's memorandum to me on October 2nd.

(2) During the truce, the Executive Headquarters will send executive teams to supervise in all dangerous locations in accordance with the following composition and methods:

    1. The executive team within the CPC military defense line has no government representatives, and the team within the government military defense line has no CPC representatives.

    2. The U.S. representative has the right to decide the location and dispatch time of the team, and report any actions that can actually be considered as a violation of the truce.

    3. The executive team stationed between the two armies has representatives from both the government and the Communist Party.

(3) The truce is announced by me and you, and neither the government nor the CPC will make an announcement.

Marshall, October 6th.

(IV) Memorandum from Zhou Enlai to Marshall (October 9th, Shanghai)

General Marshall:

The memorandum from Chairman Chiang of October 2nd, forwarded by Colonel Coe, has been received in Shanghai.

Chairman Chiang's memorandum not only refused to respond to my memorandum of September 30th, which requested an immediate cessation of military action against Zhangjiakou, but further made two demands on the CPC that violated the PCC resolutions and the troop reduction plan. Therefore, I did not reply immediately, but only had Mr. Wang Bingnan verbally inform Ambassador Stuart of my opinions, in the expectation that you and Ambassador Stuart would continue to make fair efforts for peace in China.

As Mr. Wang Bingnan has informed Ambassador Stuart, the reason why we cannot accept Chairman Chiang's two demands is due to the following reasons:

(1) According to the principles in the established agreement, the CPC and the Democratic League must obtain fourteen seats, i.e., more than one-third, of the forty members of the National Government Committee in order to ensure that the Peaceful Nation-Building Program will not be unilaterally changed. The thirteen seats proposed by the government cannot provide this guarantee, and including the non-partisan seat into the CPC and the Democratic League is also inconsistent with the PCC resolution.

(2) The National Assembly list can only be submitted to the reorganized government, and it must be after the draft constitution has been revised by the PCC as the same draft submitted to the National Assembly and after the number of National Assembly representatives has been finally agreed upon. This is the order of the PCC resolution. Chairman Chiang's request to immediately hand over the National Assembly list to a one-party government is obviously contrary to the PCC resolution.

(3) In order to effectively implement the troop reduction plan, the locations of both sides' troops during the troop reduction should be stipulated, instead of only stipulating the locations of the CPC troops, so that the government troops can maintain the freedom to move around at will, threaten at any time, and attack CPC troops and residents of the Liberated Areas.

Unexpectedly, our expectation was in vain. On the 7th, I read your memorandum of the 6th to Ambassador Stuart, and learned that Chairman Chiang only agreed to postpone the attack on Zhangjiakou for ten days on the condition that his above two demands were implemented. This is obviously a *diktat*, forcing me to submit, which makes me have to resolutely reject this proposal. Now, in addition to having Mr. Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan verbally convey our opinions, I would like to make the following statement to you, and please convey it to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek:

(1) In the memorandum of September 30th, I have already stated that the government troops' attack on Zhangjiakou indicates their determination to break completely. Therefore, only an immediate and indefinite cessation of the attack on Zhangjiakou and the withdrawal of the attacking troops to their original defense positions can show that the government is willing to reopen negotiations and avoid a rupture. Otherwise, the government shall bear full responsibility for all serious consequences.

(2) In order to show the utmost sincerity and concession, as long as the government immediately and indefinitely stops the attack on Zhangjiakou, we are willing to participate in the three-person meeting and the informal five-person group or the PCC Integrated Group to discuss the issues of ceasefire and implementation of the PCC resolutions at the same time. Regarding these two issues, the CPC has the following proposals:

    (A) Regarding the ceasefire issue (to be discussed by the three-person meeting):

    (1) The troops of both sides in the interior should be restored to their positions on January 13th. In the Northeast, they should be restored to their positions on June 7th.

    (2) The locations of the troops of both sides during the troop reduction should be stipulated.

    (3) The troops mobilized by the government in violation of the agreement should be returned to their original locations for troop reduction.

    (B) Regarding the implementation of the PCC resolutions (to be discussed by the PCC Integrated Group or the informal five-person group):

    (1) In the National Government Committee, the CPC and the Democratic League should jointly have fourteen seats to ensure that the Peaceful Nation-Building Program will not be unilaterally modified. The allocation of these fourteen seats shall be negotiated and determined by the CPC and the Democratic League.

    (2) The Executive Yuan should be reorganized in consultation with the National Government Committee at the same time.

    (3) In accordance with the principles of the PCC resolution and the procedures stipulated therein, the Constitution Drafting Committee shall revise the draft constitution as the sole draft constitution to be submitted to the National Assembly, and all parties must guarantee the passage of the draft.

    (4) The final date for the convening of the National Assembly and the allocation of the increased number of National Assembly representatives shall be negotiated and decided by the PCC Integrated Group.

    (5) After the government is reorganized in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of this item, each party shall submit the list of National Assembly representatives to the government according to the number agreed upon in the previous article.

    (6) The issue of local governments should temporarily maintain the status quo in accordance with the provisions of the Peaceful Nation-Building Program, pending the implementation of local autonomy after the government is reorganized.

    (7) In order to ensure the accurate implementation of the four promises made by Chairman Chiang on January 10th at the PCC meeting regarding the people's freedom and rights, political prisoners must first be released immediately, the tragic incidents that have occurred in various places since January of this year must be thoroughly investigated, the perpetrators must be punished, the secret service organizations must be abolished, and the newspapers, magazines, news agencies, bookstores, and people's organizations that have been closed and suspended since January of this year must be restored.

    (8) Implement military-civilian separation in accordance with the PCC's military resolutions and effectively demobilize.

The above two proposals are based on the Truce Agreement, the Troop Reduction Plan, and the five PCC resolutions. They are the most reliable way to resolve the current crisis. If the government authorities are still sincere in fulfilling these agreements, there is no reason not to agree. Otherwise, empty talk about political solutions and implementing the PCC resolutions, and in reality using force to resolve and overthrow the PCC resolutions, and not hesitating to create a situation of national division through civil war and dictatorship, the CPC will resolutely oppose to the end.

Respectfully, Zhou Enlai.

　　中共中央公布
    中共、蒋、马三方往来文件
    （九月卅日至十月九日）
    【新华社延安十一日电】中共中央顷公布九月三十日至十月九日中共、蒋介石、马歇尔三方来往文件如下：
    （一）中共代表团九月三十日致蒋介石马歇尔备忘录
    敬启者：自六月休战谈判中断以来，政府即进一步的不顾一切约束，撕毁一月停战协定，在关内大举进攻。在此三月中，政府军队已侵占解放区许多城市，摧毁许多地方的民选政权，狂炸解放区，伤害无数居民的生命财产，更提出无理的五项要求，强要中共军队及民选的地方政权退出若干地区；而当中共根据政协纲领的规定不予接受时，政府更加紧军事进攻，以期达到政治要求的目的，并扩大其占领。因此，政府军队除了攻占中原、苏北、皖北、山东、山西、河北、热河等解放区的一系列地方外，又借口中共之围困大同，声言要发动攻下承德张垣和延安。果然政府军队旋即攻占承德，并续占平绥路上如丰镇之重要城市。其实中共对大同的战役，仅是牵制山西阎锡山军队之进攻属于围困性质，最近更正式宣布撤围。大同的威胁已不存在，但政府军队却毫无任何借口的继续扩大对热河和冀东的占领，并且公然发动对张家口的三路大举进攻。事实已很显然，政府不惜以进攻中共解放区的政治军事中心之一的张家口来迫使国共关系至最后破裂的境地。恩来等特受命声明：如果政府不立即停止对张家口及其周围的一切军事行动，中共不能不认为政府业已公然宣告全面破裂，并以后放弃政治解决的方针，其因此而造成的一切严重后果，当然全部责任均应由政府方面负之，特此奉告。
    中共代表团周恩来、董必武、叶剑英、吴玉章、陆定一、邓颖超、李维汉谨启。三十五年九月卅日。
    （二）蒋介石十月二日致马歇尔备忘录
    接奉阁下一九四六年十月一日来函及另附由董必武先生交予阁下之周恩来将军一九四六年九月三十日函，为节省时间及表示其最高诚意起见，政府兹坦白表示其对于解决目前问题之最大让步。
    （一）中国共产党一向不断在催促改组国民政府，此事之关键在国府委员会名额之分配。政府原已同意分予中共八席民盟四席共计十二席，而中共请自得十席民盟四席共十四席。政府现作一新让步，以一席给予由中共推荐而政府同意之无党派人士，如此则加以原十二席共计十三席，但中共应立即交出其国府委员会候选名单，以及出席国大代表之名单。此种席数之重新分配，应由拟议中之三人小组予以决定，由政协综合小组核准。另如立即实施整军方案，中共十八个师之驻地应即决定，中共军应按已协议之日期开入指定之地区。上述之事应由三人会议决定，而在执行部监督之下进行。倘中共有获致和平及与政府合作之诚意，并愿立即解决上述两个问题，则协议达到之时，停战命令应由双方颁布。
    蒋介石签字，一九四六年十月二日于南京中华民国国民政府。
    （三）马歇尔十月六日致司徒雷登备忘录
    司徒博士：兹将我二人今晨与蒋委员长商定之办法简述于后：
    请你通知王炳南，谓我等曾向蒋委员长建议在下列条件下对张垣攻势休战十天：
    （一）休战目的在实行十月二日蒋委员长致我的备忘录中所提二项建议。
    （二）休战期间，军调部派执行小组在一切危险地点依照下列组成及办法执行监督任务：
    一、在中共军防线内之执行小组没有政府代表，在政府军防线内的小组没有中共代表。
    二、美方代表有权决定小组地点与派遣时间，并报告实际上可认为系破坏休战之任何行动。
    三、两军间派驻之执行小组有政府与共党两方代表。
    （三）由我与你二人宣布休战，政府与中共两方均不作宣布。
    马歇尔十月六日。
    （四）周恩来致马歇尔备忘录（十月九日于上海）
    马歇尔将军阁下：
    阁下令柯艾上校转来的蒋主席十月二日的备忘录业经在上海收悉。
    蒋主席的备忘录不仅拒绝答复我九月三十日备忘录所要求的立即停止进攻张家口的军事行动，反而进一步向中共提出违反政协决议及整军方案的两项要求，故我未立即作复，而只由王炳南先生将我的意见口头通知司徒大使，以期待阁下与司徒大使将继续为中国的和平而进行公正的努力。
    如王炳南先生曾经通知司徒大使的，我们所以不能接受蒋主席的两项要求，是由于以下的原因：
    （一）依照既定协议中的原则，中共及民盟必须在国府委员四十名中获得十四名即三分之一强的票数，才足以保证和平建国纲领不致被单方面变更。而政府所提议的十三名不能给以这种保证，且将无党派一席算入中共民盟，亦与政协决议不合。（二）国大名单仅能提交改组后的政府，且必须在宪法草案业经政协修正为提交国大的同一草案及国大代表名额业经最后商定之后，此乃政协决议的秩序。蒋主席要求立即以国大名单交给一党政府，显与政协决议相违。
    （三）为切实实施整军方案，应规定在整军时双方军队的驻地，而不应只规定中共军驻地，让政府军得保持随意调动随时威胁与随便进攻中共部队及解放区居民之自由。
    不意我方期待竟至落空，七日接读阁下六日致司徒大使的备忘录，得悉蒋主席仅在实行他的上述二项要求之下才同意对张家口的进攻暂缓十日，这显然是迫我屈服的哀的美顿书，使我不能不坚决拒绝这一提议。现在除已由董必武王炳南二先生口头转达我方意见外，我愿向阁下更作如下申述，并请转达蒋介石主席：
    （一）在九月三十日的备忘录中，我业已声明政府军对张家口的进攻，即系表示其不惜全面破裂的决心，故现在只有立即无限期的停止进攻张家口，并将进攻部队撤至原防，才足表示政府愿意重开谈判避免破裂，否则一切严重后果，应由政府方面负其全责。
    （二）为表示最大的诚意和让步，只要政府立即无限期的停止进攻张家口，我方愿意参加三人会议和非正式五人小组或政协综合小组，俾同时讨论停战及实施政协决议一项问题。关于此二项问题，中共有如下的提议：
    （甲）关于停战问题者（由三人会议讨论之）：
    （一）双方军队在关内应恢复一月十三日的位置。在东北应恢复六月七日的位置。
    （二）在整编中双方军队的驻地均应规定。
    （三）政府方面违约调动的军队应退回原驻地，以便整编。
    （乙）关于实施政协决议者（由政协综合小组或非正式五人小组讨论之）：
    （一）在国府委员会中，中共及民盟应合作十四名，以保证和平建国纲领不致被单方面所修改，至此十四名名额之分配，由中共与民盟双方协商定之。
    （二）行政院应与国府委员会同时协商改组。
    （三）依照政协决议之原则及其规定之程序，由宪草审议委员会修正宪法草案作为提交国大之唯一宪法草案，各党派并须保证该草案之通过。
    （四）国大之最后召开日期及国大代表增加名额之分配，应由政协综合小组协商决定之。
    （五）在政府按照本项一二两条改组后，各党派应根据前条商定之名额，将国大代表名单提交政府。
    （六）地方政权问题，应依照和平建国纲领之规定暂维原状，以待政府改组后实施地方自治。
    （七）为保证蒋主席一月十日在政协会议上关于人民自由权利之四项诺言的确切实施，须首先并立即释放政治犯，彻底查办本年一月以来各地发生之惨案，惩办凶手，取消特务组织，并恢复本年一月以来所封闭与停止的报纸杂志通讯社书店及人民团体。
    （八）根据政协的军事决议实行军民分治，并切实复员。
    上列两项提议，悉本停战协定、整军方案及政协五项决议，实为解决当前时局危机之最可靠的办法，如政府当局尚有诚意履行此等协议，应无不赞成之理，否则空言政治解决实施政协决议，实际为武力解决推翻政协决议，不惜以内战独裁造成全国分裂之局，中共方面将坚决反对到底。
    专此，并致敬意，周恩来谨启。
