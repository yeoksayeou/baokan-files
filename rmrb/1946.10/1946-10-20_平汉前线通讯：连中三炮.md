　　Ping-Han Front Communications:
    Hit Three Times in a Row
    In the battle to liberate Gucheng (north of Xushui), Gao Yunshan, a sharpshooter in a certain field army brigade of the Eighth Route Army, forced more than sixty Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers entrenched in a stubborn steel and concrete bunker in the north corner to lay down their weapons by hitting it three times in a row with three shots. Originally, these Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers, perched high up, said arrogantly, "The Eighth Route Army's few broken guns are useless." They thought that the Eighth Route Army would at most charge a few times and retreat if they couldn't get in, so despite the persuasion of their family members below the bunker and the shouts of the Eighth Route Army soldiers, they paid no attention to them. Gunner Gao Yunshan was both angry and hateful to see this, anxiously awaiting the final general attack order, thinking, "It would be good to teach them a lesson with facts!" The last appeal failed again because of the resistance of these stubborn and unrepentant lackeys. Gao Yunshan received the order to fire, and he was overjoyed. He calmly entered behind the gun mount and quickly aimed at the target. His assistant loaded the shell, and before the aiming signal was given, Gao Yunshan violently pulled the firing rope. The first shell landed right on top of the fortress, neither to the left nor to the right. With a thunderous sound, the top of the blockhouse collapsed, and the arrogant Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers fell silent. The Eighth Route Army soldiers applauded in the trenches and shouted in unison, "Hand over your guns!" Gao Yunshan loaded the second shell and said, "If you don't hand them over, I'll give you another one!" The second shell landed accurately on the right corner of the fortress, revealing a large black hole. Gao Yunshan and his assistant shouted, "Hey! If you don't hand over your guns, we'll turn the whole thing upside down!" The Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers inside shouted in confusion, but because they were being monitored, no one dared to say they would surrender. "Watch this one!" Gao Yunshan pulled the firing rope, and the third shell hit accurately again. Smoke and dust rose from the bunker, and more than sixty Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers immediately opened the door, laid down their weapons, and stood out with their hands raised. A thirteen-year-old girl burst into tears and ran over, pulling on an old puppet soldier named Xu Fenglin and saying, "Dad! How many times has the family persuaded you, but you wouldn't listen. You're doing this dog puppet soldier thing, not caring about yourself, don't you care about your children?" The Eighth Route Army soldiers and the puppet soldiers' families standing around all laughed.

　　平汉前线通讯：
    连中三炮
    八路军某野战旅神炮手高云山在解放固城（徐水北）战斗中，他曾以三炮三中，迫使盘踞北角钢骨水泥大碉堡顽抗的六十多名蒋伪军放下武器。原来这批踞高临下的蒋伪军们横的说：“八路军几条破枪，顶个屁事。”他们想八路军至多冲几次冲不上也就退去了，所以尽管碉堡下他们家属的劝说和八路军战士的喊话，他们尽当耳边风。炮手高云山看着又气又恨，焦急的等待最后总攻命令，心想：“拿事实教训教训他们才好”！最后一次喊话仍在这批顽固不死的狗腿们抗拒下失败了。高云山奉到射击的命令，他高兴得要命，镇静地进入了炮架后面，迅速瞄准了目标，他的助手把炮弹装好还没等命准号响罢，高云山猛把炮绳一拉，第一颗炮弹不左不右落在堡垒的顶上，轰隆一声，炮楼的上顶陷落，横傲的蒋伪们沉寂下去了八路军战士们在战壕里鼓着掌，一齐喊道：“交枪吧！”高云山又装好了第二颗炮弹说：“不交再给一颗！”第二颗炮弹又准准的落在堡垒的右角，露出一个大黑窟窿，高云山和他的助手喊道：“喂！不交枪给你连底翻个过！”里面蒋伪军们乱嚷嚷的叫喊起来了，可是因受监视没人敢说交枪。“再看这一个！”高云山一拉炮绳第三颗又准准的命中了，碉堡里冒起了烟尘，六十多个蒋伪军们立刻开了门，放下武器，高举双手站了出来，一个十三岁的女孩放声哭着跑过去，拉着一个叫徐凤林的老伪军说：“爸！一家人劝了你多少次你不听，你干这狗伪军，不管你自己，就不管你的娃娃们了？”周围站着的八路军战士和伪军家属，都笑起来了。
