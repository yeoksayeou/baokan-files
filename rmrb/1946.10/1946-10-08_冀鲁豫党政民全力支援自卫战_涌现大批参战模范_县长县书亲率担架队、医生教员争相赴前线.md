　　[This Dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, October 3rd] Recently, a large number of role models have emerged in the Ji-Lu-Yu Third, Fourth, and Fifth Military Districts during the participation in the war. When Changyuan Eighth District mobilized stretchers to the front lines, an elderly woman of fifty enthusiastically said, "Let my family members go first. The women in my family will do the work at home." She immediately gathered women to work in the fields. In an instant, the district assembled 600 stretchers, forming more than 50 teams, and strong young men surged to the front lines. Qi Bin, the County Head of Qi Bin County, personally led 260 stretchers to the front lines. County Head Li also took turns carrying the stretchers with the masses, giving the masses food first and preferring to go hungry himself and eat later, ultimately completing the mission victoriously. The county party secretaries of Kunwu and Juancheng also personally led stretchers to the front lines. County Head Chen of Fan County personally directed 300 militiamen, 300 carts, and 300 stretchers, totaling more than 1,000 people, to go to the front lines. County Head Ji Jianyi of Pu County led 250 stretchers, and primary school teachers Wang Yugeng and Ji Lingshan also scrambled to lead 50 stretchers. Mr. Wu Dehui, a doctor from the Yuhuotang Pharmacy in Jishanji, Juancheng County, brought a lot of medicine with the stretcher team to the front lines, saying before leaving: "I will take care of the stretcher bearers at the front so they don't get sick, so they can transport the wounded well." At the same time, Xin Sheng Hospital, Shou Kang Yuan, Qin He Cheng, Yu De Tang and other pharmacies in the same village donated Ten Drops of Water, eye drops, "Wanrenyou" (a popular ointment) and various other medicines to Mr. Wu to take to the front.
