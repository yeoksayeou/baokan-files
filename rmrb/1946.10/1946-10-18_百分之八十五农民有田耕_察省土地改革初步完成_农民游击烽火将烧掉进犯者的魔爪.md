　　Eighty-Five Percent of Farmers Have Land to Till
    Initial Land Reform Completed in Chahar Province
    Guerrilla Flames of Farmers Will Burn Away the Invaders' Claws
    [Xinhua News Agency, Weixian, 10th] The large-scale land reform movement in various parts of Chahar Province has now been initially completed. This movement, stretching from the northern grasslands to the southern rice paddy areas of Chahar, has swept through more than ten counties, encompassing the vast majority of middle and poor peasants, as well as some rich peasants, industrialists, and merchants. According to a simple calculation from five counties, including Wanquan and Huailai, approximately 869 villages and over 450,000 farmers (accounting for more than 85 percent of the total population) have initially realized "land to the tiller." The fundamental reason for the victory of the movement lies in the close unity of all middle and poor peasants and the fair and reasonable distribution of the fruits of victory from rent reduction and liquidation. After over 16,000 farmers in Wanquan County were emancipated, more than 2,000 extremely poor peasant households changed their old ways. More than 9,000 poor peasant households have risen to become middle peasants, some of whom continue to rise to become rich peasants. In the urban and rural areas of Huailai, 375 tenant households obtained land and houses, with 213 households rising to become ordinary owner-farmers, 104 becoming middle peasants, and 58 becoming rich peasants. In the 25 villages of the eighth district of Xuanhua, all 715 extremely poor peasant households have been transformed, and the number of poor peasant households has decreased from 1,453 to 715. On average, each person has 3.2 mu of cultivated land. The number of middle peasant households has increased from 915 to 3,037, with an average of 5.1 mu of cultivated land per person. In the emancipation movement, when dozens of tenant households in nine streets of the first district of Xuanhua negotiated with the landlord Zhao Bing@ a month ago to return their rent, they merely calculated the enemy puppet burden, which was equivalent to 219 mu of land. However, in order to take care of the landlord's life, the tenants only requested the return of 60 mu of land. The excess exploitation was waived. Lu ×× of Dongguan, Yanqing, relied on the power of the puppet village head to transfer all the burdens of his 140 mu of leased land to the tenants and used the baojia system to exact excessive taxes and levies from the masses. After liquidation, the minimum compensation from the Lu family should have been more than 120 shi of grain, but as a result, they were only required to compensate 79 mu of land, leaving the family of five or six with 55 mu, so that the Lu family still maintains the status of a wealthy middle peasant. This benevolent action has won the sympathy and support of the broad social circles. The emancipated peasants expressed extreme anger at Chiang Kai-shek's invasion of Chahar Province. After Chiang Kai-shek's claws stepped into Chahar Province, widespread guerrilla warfare was launched by farmers in various places. In four counties, including Dongguan, Yanqing, more than 1,500 young and middle-aged people participated in the main force. In Zhuolu and Huailai counties, the number of people joining the army also reached more than 8,000.

　　百分之八十五农民有田耕
    察省土地改革初步完成
    农民游击烽火将烧掉进犯者的魔爪
    【新华社蔚县十日电】察哈尔省各地大规模土地改革运动现已初步完毕。这一运动北起塞北草原，南至察南水田区，遍及十余县份，包括了占人口绝大多数的中贫农和一部富农工商等阶层。现据万全、怀来等五县简略统计：已初步实现耕者有其田的约有八百六十九个村庄、四十五万余农民（占全人口百分之八十五以上）。运动胜利的基本原因在于全部中贫农紧密团结与公平合理分配了减租清算的胜利果实，万全县一万六千余农民翻身后，二千余户赤贫农都改旧观。九千多户贫农已上升为中农，其中部分并继续上升为富农。怀来城厢五条街三百七十五户佃农获得土地房舍，升为普通自耕农者二百一十三户。中农者一百零四户。富农者五十八户。宣化八区廿五村，赤贫农七百一十五户已全部改观，贫农由一四五三户减至七一五户。平均每人有耕地三亩二分。中农则由九一五户，增至三○三七户，平均每人有耕地五亩一分。在翻身运动中，宣化一区九街数十户佃农于月前向地主赵丙＠交涉退租时，仅仅强加之敌伪负担一项，即算出折合土地二百一十九亩。但佃农们为照顾地主生活，只要退地六十亩。其余超额剥削部分，均予免退。延庆东关鲁××依仗伪甲长势力，将家中一百四十余亩出租地的负担全部转与佃户，并借包缴伪税苛刻勒索群众。经清算鲁家最低应赔偿合粮一百二十余石，结果只要其赔偿七十九亩土地，另给他全家五、六口人留下五十五亩，使鲁家现仍保持富裕中农的家境。这种仁厚行动博得广大社会人士的同情与赞助。翻了身的农民对于蒋介石的进攻察省表示了极度愤怒，在蒋介石的魔爪踏进察省以后，各地农民掀起了广泛的游击战争。延庆东关等四个县，参加主力的青壮年一千五百余人。涿鹿、怀来两县，参军人数亦达八千以上。
