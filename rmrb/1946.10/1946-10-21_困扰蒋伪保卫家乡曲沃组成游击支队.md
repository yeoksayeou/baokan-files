　　Harassing Chiang Kai-shek's Puppets: Quwo Forms Guerrilla Detachment to Defend the Homeland
    [Our Quwo Correspondent Reports] The military and civilians in the liberated areas are engaging in comprehensive resistance against the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. Patriotic youths in Quwo have established the Fendong Detachment to launch guerrilla warfare, coordinate with the Eighth Route Army to attack the enemy, and defend their homeland. Young and middle-aged people who have been displaced from villages occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army have also armed themselves to form the Tiaodong Brigade, striking the enemy, covering the safe transfer of the masses, and eliminating traitors and preventing enemy agents. The local masses and the government are making arrangements for their families and the refugees who have escaped, lending grain, finding furniture, and helping them solve all their difficulties. Those who have been transferred to the south of the road have received 200 shi of millet borrowed from the Second Special District Office. The county bank has also provided a loan of 500,000 yuan to help them establish production and consumption cooperatives, organizing male and female labor to engage in textile, workshops, commerce, peddling, and transportation. People and livestock are used as shares, with dividends distributed according to shares. The transferred masses are all very moved and say, "Our government is truly good; we are not afraid of any difficulties." (He Jieshou)
