Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Moscow dispatch: The second session of the Supreme Soviet Standing Committee of the Soviet Union opened on the 15th in the Kremlin Palace, with 1,300 representatives in attendance. The Standing Committee heard the budget report for 1946 presented by Finance Minister Zverev. The budget's revenue exceeds 333 billion rubles, and expenditures exceed 319 billion rubles, of which defense spending is 72 billion rubles, a decrease of 58.8 billion rubles compared to wartime (equivalent to US$11.095 billion). Construction funds will exceed the pre-war (1940) level by 40 percent, and education spending will exceed the 1940 level by 17.6 billion rubles. The largest increase in the budget is for scientific research, with an allocation of 5 billion rubles, a 2.4-fold increase over last year. In addition, expenditures for schools, public health, material culture, social insurance, social security, and large family allowances will also increase this year in an effort to improve people's lives. The Associated Press reported that foreign observers believe that the new budget is characterized by a sharp reduction in defense spending, with the largest portion of expenditures being used to help implement the new Five-Year Plan. A People's Daily editorial commented on this, saying, "This year's budget can be called the Five-Year Plan in action. In the past five years, we have lived on a wartime budget. The new budget reflects a new era and new tasks. This shows that our country has not only gloriously passed all the tests of the most serious war but has also victoriously healed the wounds of the war and is confidently marching towards a new peak."

　　苏联举行最高苏维埃常会
    兹维莱夫报告新预算
    为实现五年计划，国防费剧减，建设费大增
    【新华社延安十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃第二届常会已于十五日在克里姆林宫大厅开幕，到有一千三百名代表。常会听取财政部长兹维莱夫提出一九四六年度的预算报告。该预算收入超过三千三百三十亿卢布，支出超过三千一百九十亿卢布，其中国防经费为七百二十亿卢布，较战时减少五百八十八亿卢布（合美金一百一十亿九千五百万元），而建设款项将超过战前（四零年）一年百分之四十，教育经费则超过一九四零年一百七十六亿卢布。预算中增加最大的是发展科学研究经费为五十亿卢布，较去年增加二点四倍。此外学校公共卫生物质文化社会保险社会赡养及大家庭津贴之经费，本年度亦将增加，以努力改善人民的生活。合众社称：外国观察家认为新预算的特点，为国防经费之剧减，以及支出方面最大部分将借以帮助新五年计划的实行。真理报社论对此评称：“本年度预算可以叫做行动中的五年计划。过去五年依靠战时预算生活，新预算反映了新的时代新的任务。这显示了我国不仅光荣地渡过最严重战争之一切考验，而且胜利地医治了战争的创伤，并正自信地向新的最高峰迈进。”
