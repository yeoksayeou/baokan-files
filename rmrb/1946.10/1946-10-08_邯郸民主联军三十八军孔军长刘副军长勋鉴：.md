　　To Commander Kong and Deputy Commander Liu of the 38th Army of the Handan Democratic Allied Army:
    We have heard from afar of the establishment of your esteemed army in Handan, and we are greatly inspired. Your esteemed army has made remarkable achievements in subverting the Qing Dynasty, destroying the Northern Warlords, opposing dictatorial civil war, and in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. Now, you are raising the banner of justice even higher, dedicating yourselves to the cause of independence, peace, and democracy. We are filled with boundless admiration. We send this telegram to extend our congratulations and express our willingness to work together with all the officers and soldiers of your esteemed army, promote the revolutionary traditions of our Northwest people, resolutely smash the offensive of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, and fight to the end for the victory of the people of the whole country.
    Wang Shitai, Acting Commander; Xi Zhongxun, Acting Political Commissar; Tu Kuiyao, Deputy Commander; Zhang Zhongliang, Deputy Political Commissar of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Joint Defense Army
                                            September 29th

    To Commander Kong and Deputy Commander Zhou of the 38th Army of Handan:
    We are delighted to hear that your esteemed army has been gloriously established in Handan, raising the banner of justice, which is what the people want. We are filled with joy to hear the news from afar. This is not only a head-on blow to the traitorous dictator but also a new force for the democratic camp. Although our army is mediocre, we will advance hand in hand with your esteemed army and vow to fight for the cause of independence, peace, and democracy in China! We send this telegram to extend our congratulations and wish you good health!
    Cao Youshen, Brigade Commander of the New 11th Brigade, and all officers and soldiers together send congratulations
                                              September 29th
