　　Spoils of War
    A Street Scene in a Village in Hongdong
    Jin Sha
    A joyful piece of news is spreading on the street. Young wives and children squatting in cave dwellings and sitting on kangs [heated brick beds] can no longer stay put. They are rushing to the street. Even old ladies in their seventies and eighties are hurrying out, leaning on their canes. The chickens on the street are scattering and squawking in chaos…
    At the east end of the street, there is a Land God Temple. From the Land God Temple eastward, there are now nine large carts parked in a row. Nine sturdy oxen are panting heavily. The carts are fully loaded with "Chiang Kai-shek Type" rifles.
    An old lady is standing next to a cart, reaching out to touch the rifles on the cart. Her wrinkles immediately unfold, and she says with a smile, "Look at our troops, look at our troops…", so excited that she doesn't know what to say. The old lady touches the rifles again. Young wives are clamoring and making noise. They suddenly burst out laughing. One of them, blushing, is scolding another in a coquettish voice, but her voice is full of infinite joy. This is Dong Xiao-si’s wife, whom everyone knows. Dong Xiao-si is a combatant in a certain company. He also participated in the battle of Guanque this time. A naughty child climbed onto a cart, trying to pull out the small bayonet on a rifle, his face flushed and his neck thick, just saying, "Give me this small knife, give me this small knife, I'm going to kill Chiang Kai-shek…"
    Next to the second cart, there is a combatant escorting the spoils of war, wearing a dark gray military uniform, standing tall and carrying a "Chiang Kai-shek Type" rifle, telling the people standing around the carts about the origin of these rifles. From his narration, people seem to see countless combatants charging forward in fierce artillery fire, some being knocked down by shells, but others charging up, being knocked down again, and charging up again…
    At this time, the combatant is narrating a vivid battle scene.
    "Artillery fire protected the four fortresses including Guanque. The Sixth Company had already reached the front of the fourth fortress. At this time, the first, second, and third fortresses on the right had been destroyed under many bombs, but the fourth fortress still stood stubbornly. Fire was almost shooting out of the combatants' eyes.
    The company commander gave the order to attack. Dozens of dark shadows rushed from in front of the company commander to the front of the fortress. At this time, American heavy machine guns in the fortress were firing wildly. But the combatants pounced on the pillbox like tigers, raised bombs and threw them over. Fireballs exploded one after another, but the shooting in the fortress was still dense and fierce…
    At this time, the company commander got angry. He said, "Put down your rifles, take the bombs, prepare for the second charge, we must take this fortress down!" After he finished speaking, he had already taken the lead in rushing over, quickly rushing to the front of the fortress. Bombs flew over like rain, finally destroying the fourth fortress… These rifles were captured by our troops in this battle."
    Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, feeling that the combatant in front of them had become tall, as tall as a huge mountain with no top in sight.
    An old lady surnamed Dong brought out a bowl of water from her home and respectfully offered it to the combatant with both hands, saying, "You have worked hard, please drink this bowl of water!"

　　胜利品
    洪洞某村街头速写
    金沙
    街上在传说着一个可喜的消息，蹲在窑洞里的，坐在坑上的年青媳妇娃娃已经坐不住了，飞快的往街上跑，连七八十的老太太也急忙的拄着棍子跟着走出来，街上的鸡被冲的乱飞乱叫………。
    这条街的东头有个土地祠，从土地祠往东现在一连停着九辆大车，好大的九条大键牛，正在喘着气，车上满载的是“中正式”步枪。
    一个老太太站在大车旁边伸出手来摸一摸车上的枪，皱纹立刻展开了，笑着说：“看咱的队伍，看咱的队伍………”，兴奋得不知该说些什么，说着老太太又摸了摸枪。年青的媳妇吵着，闹着，他们忽然哈哈的笑起来，其中有一个红着脸的在同另一个娇声地骂着、但声音里却含着无限的喜悦。这是人人熟悉的董小四的媳妇。董小四是某连的战斗员，这次官雀战斗中也有他，一个淘气的娃娃爬上了大车，用小手拔着枪上的小剌刀，拔的脸红脖子粗，只是说：“给我这个小刀，给我这个小刀，杀蒋介石去………。”
    在第二辆大车旁边，有个押送胜利品的战斗员，穿着一身深灰色的军衣，雄纠纠的提着一支“中正”式枪，在给站在大车四周围的人们，讲着这些枪的来历，人们从他的叙述中，好像看到了无数的战斗员，在猛烈的炮火中，冲向前去，有的被炮弹炸倒了，但后面的又冲上去，又炸倒，又上去…………。
    这时，那个战斗员，正在叙述一个生动的战斗场面。
    “炮火把官雀等四个堡垒保护着，六连已经摸到第四个堡垒前，这时右边第一第二第三个堡垒已经在许多炸弹下毁灭了，但第四个堡垒还顽强地耸立着。战斗员的眼睛里几乎冒出火来。
    连长下了攻击令，几拾条黑影从连长面前，冲到堡垒前，这时堡垒里的美国重机枪疯狂地扫射着。但战斗员们像猛虎一般的扑上炮楼，举起炸弹投过去，一朵朵火花爆炸着，但堡垒里的射击，还是密集而猛烈………。
    这时连长火了，他说：“放下步枪，带上炸弹，准备第二次冲锋，一定要把这个堡垒夺下来”，说完话自己已在前面领头扑过去，很快的冲到堡垒前，炸弹像雨一样飞过去，终于把第四个堡垒毁灭了……。这些枪就是咱们队伍在这次战斗中夺过来的”。
    所有的人都松了口气，感到面前的这位战斗员，高大起来，高得像一座看不到顶的大山。
    一个姓董的老太太，从家里端出一碗水来，双手敬给这个战斗员，说：“你们辛苦啦，请喝我这碗水！”。
