Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Moscow News: The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's League opened in Moscow on the 10th. Representatives from countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, and France attended. The Chairman of the League delivered the opening speech, stating that the League is sincerely dedicated to the cause of peace. The Executive Committee members of the League pointed out that the United States' refusal to issue an exit passport to Mrs. Gotovalt (Chairman of the International Democratic Women's League) and the Kuomintang government's refusal to issue exit passports to Deng Yingchao and other female representatives of the country are both "attempts by reactionaries to hinder the development of the women's democratic movement."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Moscow News: The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's League, which opened here on the 10th, continued its meeting on the morning of the 13th. At the meeting, Polish representative Plagirova (Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Insurance of Poland) reported on the work of the Polish Women's League. The meeting concluded by sending a congratulatory telegram to League Chairman Mrs. Gotovalt, as that day was her sixty-fifth birthday.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: New York News: The International Women's Conference was held in New York on the 14th, attended by 300 women representatives, including representatives from 53 countries. Comrade Deng Yingchao, the Chinese women leader who was invited to attend, was unable to participate due to the Kuomintang government's unreasonable refusal to issue a passport. Soong Ching Ling and Wu Yifang also did not attend. Mrs. Roosevelt will attend the meeting on the 20th to deliver a speech.
