Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th—According to Reuters: Two hundred and sixteen overseas Chinese organizations in Singapore held a meeting on the 27th of last month demanding the withdrawal of US troops from China. The meeting decided to organize the "Overseas Chinese Association for Promoting Peace and Democracy in China," and resolved to support Mr. Chen Jiageng's recent telegram to President Truman requesting the United States to stop aiding the Chinese government. The conference sent fifteen representatives to visit Mr. Chen Jiageng to express their support. The conference declaration stated: The Kuomintang government's one-party dictatorship is regrettable. Such a government will never work for the welfare of the people, but only preserve the bureaucratic system. Note: Mr. Chen Jiageng continues to be the chairman of the East Indies Overseas Chinese Relief Fund. Since 1937, he has been working hard for the democratic cause of the motherland, and is now leading the vast masses of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, and other parts of Southeast Asia in pursuing the peace and democratic movement of the motherland.
