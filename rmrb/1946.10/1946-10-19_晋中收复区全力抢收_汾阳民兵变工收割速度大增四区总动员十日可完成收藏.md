　　Jinzhong Recovered Area Goes All Out to Harvest
    Fenyang Militia's Cooperative Labor Greatly Increases Harvesting Speed; Total Mobilization in Four Districts to Complete Harvesting in Ten Days

    [Xinhua News Agency, Lishi, 16th] After the Jinzhong Eighth Route Army recovered the important towns of Luocheng, Renyan, and Jicun in Fenyang County, which were once occupied by Yan's troops, on the 4th, the Fenyang County Government immediately mobilized the masses to go all out to harvest the autumn crops. The Luocheng militia formed a large cooperative labor team and first rushed to harvest the autumn fields southwest of the village, which were closer to Yan's troops. In one day, they harvested more than 30 mu of millet, exceeding the usual speed by one-third. More than ten villages in the Shangbu, Xiaoxiang, Jinshan, and Jishe areas of the Fourth District of Fenyang, including men, women, old, and young, have all been mobilized to rush to harvest, and it is expected that all crops can be collected within ten days.

　　晋中收复区全力抢收
    汾阳民兵变工收割速度大增四区总动员十日可完成收藏
    【新华社离石十六日电】晋中八路军于四日恢复汾阳境内曾一度被阎军侵占之罗城、仁岩、冀村等重镇后，汾阳县政府立即动员群众，全力进行抢收秋禾。罗城民兵组成一个大变工队，首先抢收村西南距阎军较近的秋田，一天内即收割谷子三十余亩，超出平常速度三分之一。汾阳四区之上堡、小相、尽善、冀社等十余村，男女老幼全部出动抢收，预计十天内可全部收藏完毕。
