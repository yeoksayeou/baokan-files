Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Longhai, 6th: The Huazhong Democratic Allied Army, under the command of Hao Pengju, achieved its first victory in the self-defense war.

The Huazhong Democratic Allied Army bravely repelled them. On the 25th of last month, Chiang's troops and the "Returning Home Corps," numbering over 400 (including several Japanese soldiers), returned in force. A unit of the Allied Army, in coordination with the militia, gave them a head-on blow. Chiang's troops were routed in disarray. In this battle, over 40 Chiang soldiers were captured alive, and over 50 were killed or wounded. In the two battles, 14 people, including the army battalion commander, were gloriously wounded.
