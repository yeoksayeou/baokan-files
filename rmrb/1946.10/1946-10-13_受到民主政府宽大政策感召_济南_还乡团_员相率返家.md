Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 10th. The personnel of the "Fellows Association," "Homecoming Corps," and other organizations sent by the Jiang army in Jinan, deeply moved by the lenient policy of the democratic government, are returning to the liberated areas one after another. In Dongguozhuangbu Village and other two districts of Licheng County alone, more than one hundred people have returned in the past half month. Wang Fengwu, a member of the "Homecoming Corps," said to his fellow villagers after returning home: "These six months in Jinan were worse than ten years in prison! At first, I was misled by bad people and ran to Jinan to open a noodle restaurant, but the taxes forced us to the point where we couldn't even make ends meet. This April, the Pacification Headquarters forced us to join the 'Homecoming Corps' and forced us to fight the Eighth Route Army. Now that I'm back home, the democratic government is still so lenient. I will definitely work hard and live a good life." Zhu Yukun has opened a noodle shop for business after returning home. Recently, the families of "Homecoming Corps" members in various places are launching a campaign to persuade their husbands and children to return home.

　　受到民主政府宽大政策感召
    济南“还乡团”员相率返家
    【新华社临沂十日电】济南蒋军派出之“同乡会”“还乡团”等人员，深受民主政府宽大政策的感召，相率返回解放区。仅历城县东郭庄埠村等两个区，半月来已有百余人返还。“还乡团”团员王凤舞回家后对其乡邻说：“这半年在济南比坐十年监牢还难熬！最初误听坏人挑拨，跑到济南开面馆，可叫捐税逼的连吃穿都混不上。今年四月间，绥靖司令部强迫我们参加‘还乡团’，逼我们打八路军，现在回到家，民主政府还这样宽大，我一定好好生产过日子。”朱玉坤回家后，已开设一家面铺营生。近日各地“还乡团”家属正掀起规劝丈夫、子弟回家运动。
