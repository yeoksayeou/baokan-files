　　Yongzhi Tianzhuang Branch Promotes the Realization of "Land to the Tiller"
　　Zhang Fengcai
　　After the struggle against traitors and liquidation in Tianzhuang, the turn-over struggle of the broad masses was completely victorious. Politically, the feudal rule of the landlord class was defeated. Economically, the landlords returned the land and property they had plundered from the peasants in the past through feudal exploitation and other means. The fruits of the struggle totaled 551 mu of land, plus houses, trees, etc., totaling approximately 3 million yuan in value.
　　Different methods were used to handle houses etc. and land when dealing with the fruits of the struggle. The method of dividing houses etc. was simply: based on members participating in the struggle, they were divided into eight grades and twenty-four levels. The first batch has already been distributed according to this method. The first level, consisting of the poorest, received 4,800 yuan per person. However, even the upper-middle peasants at the twenty-fourth level, averaging seven mu of land per person, also received 240 yuan in benefits from the struggle per person. As for land distribution, they adopted the method of equalizing land ownership, dividing the land among landless and land-poor peasants on a per capita basis. Now, the method of land distribution is detailed below:
　　(1) The original land situation in Tianzhuang:
　　The village had a total of 223 households, 880 people, and 3,504 mu of land, averaging 3.9 mu of wheat land per person. However, the actual situation before the struggle was:
　　Landlords: 4 households, 47 people, 895 mu of land, averaging 19 mu per person. Their population accounted for only slightly more than 5% of the total village population, but they owned slightly more than 25% of the village's land. The wealth of the landlord class has always been built on exploiting and oppressing the vast number of peasants. For example, the landlord Tian Menglan had 551 mu of land. During the eight years of enemy rule, he relied on enemy power and never paid a single grain of burden or sent out a single laborer. He shifted the burden and labor onto the peasants of the village. The houses near his home were all bought by him. He took whatever he set his sights on, so his mansion was spacious, with 48 tall buildings, and his land plots were large, one or two hundred mu each, without a single grave mound. Truly, the landlord's happy life was bought with the disasters transferred to the peasants. Countless peasants' happiness was ruined for the landlord's sake.
　　Middle peasants: 95 households, 355 people, 1,704 mu of land, averaging 4.8 mu per person. Their population accounted for slightly more than 40% of the total village population, and they owned slightly more than 48% of the village's land. Under the rule of the landlord class, the prospect of rising to rich peasants was slim, while falling to poor peasants was a familiar path. Many poor peasants spoke with nostalgia about how they had sold their land and property to the landlords in the past. Some said, "They [the landlords] came up with a lot of capital to buy our things. It was hard not to sell, but who knew that once the property was sold, it would never come back!" Some now live in the family temple.
　　Poor peasants: 124 households, 478 people, 904 mu of land, averaging slightly more than 1.8 mu per person. Their population accounted for slightly more than 54% of the total village population, but they owned slightly less than 26% of the village's land. The poor peasants, apart from being oppressed and exploited by the landlords or being forced to take risks, had little to do with the landlords. The chairman of the peasants' association (a poor peasant), Xia Qingling, recalled while sitting on the top of the building: "When this building was built, I worked non-stop for a year. After it was built, I never went up to this building for thirty years. Not to mention going upstairs, I rarely even entered his gate. If there was anything, someone would send me away outside the gate." Many people were forced by enemy disasters and natural disasters to flee, resulting in separated wives and children, and even starvation, while the landlords remained safe and sound, living a happy life upstairs.
　　From the above figures on the population and land ownership ratios of each class and their living conditions, it is clear that the current land situation is unreasonable, truly "the tiller has no land" and "the non-tiller occupies the peasants' land."
　　(2) The method and process of land distribution:
　　After the struggle, when dealing with the fruits of the struggle, the only clear guiding thought was: to distribute the land to landless and land-poor peasants. But exactly how to distribute it was very vague.
　　At the first branch committee meeting, general principles for distributing the fruits of the struggle, such as dividing public land, distributing clearly, democratic discussion, poor peasants and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers receiving more, and land must be given to landless and land-poor peasants, were generally discussed to provide guidance. Everyone had no disagreement, but also no specific methods, so the discussion ended without result.
　　At the second expanded branch committee meeting, seven people participated in the discussion. A branch committee member from a poor peasant background, ×××, proposed: "Distribute the land per capita, with three mu as the standard. Those with more than three mu per person will not receive land, those without land will be given three mu per person, and those with less than three mu per person will be supplemented to three mu per person." When the cadres heard his opinion, they thought that ×××'s opinion was a concrete way to distribute the land to landless and land-poor peasants. So they quickly praised his proposal and encouraged everyone to discuss it. During the discussion, three people disagreed: one was a family member of a revolutionary martyr who farmed seven or eight mu of public land and had two people in the family; one was a branch committee member with two people in the family and slightly more than one mu of land; and one was the chairman of the peasants' association with five people in the family and seven or eight mu of land, with four people fleeing to Guanwai during the famine. They were afraid that they would not receive land or would not receive more land because they had few people or farmed public land. Some proposed that the land should be divided according to the members or households participating in the struggle. Apart from these three people, the other four people agreed.
　　As a result of the debate, ×××'s opinion was adopted, and the following supplementary decisions were made:
　　(1) Public land and temple land can be handed over and not counted as one's own land. (2) Those who fled during the famine can be left with land to be given to them when they return. If there is not enough land to distribute, they will be asked to farm public land and temple land. Afterwards, the chairman of the peasants' association proposed the opinion: "Public land and temple land are not ancestral property, it is more appropriate to leave the land obtained from the struggle for those who fled."
　　The third meeting was a meeting of all party members, with eleven people participating. The branch committee's opinion on land distribution was put forward, and everyone discussed and studied it. As a result, the following supplementary decisions were made: (1) Families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, who belong to the poor peasants, should be given special consideration with public land and temple land in addition to the land they should receive. (2) The quality of the original land of those receiving land should not be converted. The evaluation committee should pay attention to controlling it. Those with good original land should be given bad land, and those with bad original land should be given good land, so that good and bad land are evenly distributed. (3) If those who should receive land have mortgaged land, if it is mortgaged or falsely mortgaged landlord's land, it should be unconditionally changed to dead pledge land and calculated according to his land. If it is mortgaged to other classes of land, a part of the dead price should be found and redeemed, and the remaining real dead pledge land should be calculated and distributed to him. (4) The method of distributing land to families of collaborators and personnel of puppet armies and puppet organizations who belong to the poor peasants is: (1) Personnel of puppet armies and puppet organizations who have repented and been recognized as good people by the masses should be distributed land like other poor peasants. Those who are not considered good enough by the masses should be distributed less land, but not immediately given to them. The peasants' association will farm the land on their behalf and give the land to them when they transform and become good. Both types of families of collaborators should be distributed land like other poor peasants. (2) For family members of those who served in the puppet army who have not yet returned home, the land that their family should receive will be farmed or rented out to their family by the peasants' association. When he is brought back or it is confirmed that the puppet army soldier has died, his family will be given the land they should receive or they will be told to stop paying rent. However, the puppet army and puppet organization personnel themselves are not counted in the population.
　　This meeting of all party members finally unified the party's thinking and determined the specific issues in land distribution. Then, a mass meeting was convened. The chairman of the peasants' association explained the general principles of distributing the fruits of the struggle, strengthened unity education, and announced the above method of land distribution. Generally, the poor peasants said after the announcement: "This distribution is very reasonable!" The middle peasants also said: "We have land, the land from the struggle should be given to the poor to farm!"
　　After the land obtained from the struggle was distributed, the 478 poor peasants, who originally had 904 mu of land, plus the 551 mu of land from the struggle, meant that 478 people were divided into 1,455 mu of land, or three mu per person. Twenty-one mu of land can also be left to take care of those who fled or to further solve the land problem for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In this way, the poor peasants who rose to middle peasants, although there are no specific statistics yet. In short, after this struggle against traitors and liquidation, the feudal exploitation system that had existed for thousands of years was eliminated, and the peasants realized "land to the tiller."

　　永智田庄支部  推动实现耕者有其田
    张凤彩
    田庄经过了反奸清算斗争后，广大群众的翻身斗争彻底胜利了。政治上打垮了地主阶级的封建统治，在经济上使地主退回了过去用封建剥削等方式从农民们手中所掠夺去的土地和财产。斗争果实共有土地五五一亩，另有房屋、树木等共折价约三百万元。
    处理果实时，房屋等与土地采用了不同的办法。房屋等的分法简单说是：以斗争成员为单位，共分八等二十四级，第一批已经按此法分配，赤贫中的第一级每人分到四千八百元，但每人平均七亩地的富中农是第二十四级，每人也能分到二百四十元的斗争实惠。而土地分配，他们是采用了平均地权的办法，把土地以人为单位的分给无地和少地的农民，今把土地分配的方法详述于下：
    （一）田庄原来的土地状况：
    本村共二二三户、八八○口人、三五○四亩地，全村平均每人三亩九分麦地。但斗争前的实际情况是：
    地主四户，四七口人，八九五亩地，平均每人十九亩地。其人口仅占全村人口之百分之五强，却占有全村土地百分之二五强。从来地主阶级的富都是靠着剥削压迫广大农民而发家的，如地主田梦兰有五五一亩地，在敌人统治的八年，依仗敌势，他就没拿过一粒负担，没出过一个夫。他把出负担出夫都转嫁在本村农民身上，靠近个家的宅子均为他所买，他看准的就想法要在手里，所以他的宅子宽大，住着四十八间的高大楼房，土地块也大，一二百亩一块，就没有一个坟头，真是地主的幸福生活，不知转嫁给农民多少灾难换来的，无数农民的幸福为地主断送了。
    中农九五户，三五五口人，一七○四亩地，平均每人四亩八分地，其人口占全村人口百分之四十强，占有全村土地之百分之四十八强。中农在地主阶级的统治下，上升富农前途渺茫，下降为贫农都是熟路。不少的贫农谈起话来，很留恋的说到自己过去如何把土地和房产卖给了地主，有的说：“人家霍着大本钱要咱的东西，咱不卖又作难，谁知这财产出手后就回不来了呢！”有的现在就搬到家庙中去住了。
    贫农一二四户，四七八口人，九○四亩地，每人平均一亩八分多地，其人口占全村人口百分之五十四强，却只占全村土地百分之二六弱。贫农除了受地主的压迫剥削或被逼挺而走险外，其他与地主是没有什么来往的。农会长（贫农）夏庆令坐在楼顶上回忆着说：“当初盖这楼时，我不停的作了一年工，盖起以后三十年的工夫，咱就永没上过这个楼。别说上楼，进他的大门的时候也很少，有点事在大门外边就有人把咱打发了”。好多人被敌灾天灾所逼逃了难，闹的妻离子散，甚至饿死，而地主仍然安安稳稳不下楼过幸福生活。
    从以上各阶层的人口和占有土地比例数字及生活状况来看，很明显土地现状是不合理的，真是“耕者无其田”和“不耕者霸占着农民的土地。”
    （二）分配土地的方法及过程：
    斗争过去后，处理果实的时候，领导思想只有一点明确就是：把土地分给无地和少地的农民。但究竟如何分法，是很模糊的。
    在第一次支委会上，把分配果实地一般原则如分公、分清、民主讨论、贫农抗属多分、土地一定与无地和少地的农民等问题作了启发，大家没有什么异议，也没什么办法，扯了一下，无结果而散。
    第二次扩大支委会上，七个人参加讨论，一个贫农成份的支委×××提出：“按人分地，三亩为标准，每人有三亩以上者不分，无地者每人给他三亩，每人不够三亩者补够他三亩的办法来”。当时干部听到他这个意见后，认为×××的意见正是把土地分给无地和少地农民的具体办法。就抓紧表扬他这个提法，启发大家讨论他这个意见。讨论时有三个人不同意；一个是种七八亩公田有两口人的抗属。一个是有两口人一亩多地的支委。一个是有五口人，七八亩地而四口人在灾荒期间逃往关外的农会长。他们当时怕自己人少或种有公田而分不到土地或不能多分些土地，有的就提出土地应按斗争成员或按斗争户分的意见，除他三个人外，其他四个人的意见是一致的。
    争论结果通过了×××的意见，另外又补充决定：
    （一）公田庙地不按自己土地计算可交出来。（二）灾荒期间逃出者可给他们留下土地等他们回来时再给他们，如土地实在不够分配时，就叫他们种公田庙地。事后农会长又提出：“公田庙地不是祖上产业、还是给逃难的留下斗争出来的土地合适”的意见。
    第三次是召开的全体党员会，有十一个人参加，提出了支委会关于分配土地的意见，大家讨论研究，结果又作了如下的补充：（一）属于贫农的抗属及老弱孤寡除应分土地外，还应以公田庙地特别照顾他们。（二）分地者原有地质的好坏，不折合，评议委员会应注意掌握，原有地质良好者给他坏地，原有地质坏者给他好地，一定把好坏地匀开。（三）应得地者如有典当地时，如系典当或假当地主土地，就无条件的改成死契地。按他之土地计算。如系典当其他阶层土地，就找死价一部，赎回一部，按留下实有死契地计算分给他土地。（四）属于贫农伪属及伪军伪组织人员分土地的办法是：（１）悔过自新群众公认是好人的伪军伪组织人员，和其他贫农一样分得土地。群众认为还不够好的，土地少分给他些，但不马上给他，农会代种等地转变好时，再给他的土地。以上两种伪属都和其他贫农一样分得土地。（２）对当伪军现在尚未回家的家属，把他家应得土地由农会代种或租种给他家，等争取他本人回来或确证该伪军死了时，就给他家应分的土地或叫他家停止交租，但伪军伪组织人员本人不按人口计算。
    这次全体党员会，最后统一了党内思想，确定了土地分配中的具体问题，就召开了群众大会，由农会长把分配果实的原则问题作了启发，回去后斗争成员分组讨论。
    在第一次召开小组长汇报的时候，十七个组的意见是：十三个组主张先分房屋等财产，三个组主张先分土地，一个组没有具体意见。
    组长汇报后发现了领导思想与群众意见不一致，于是就提出：“先分房屋等财产可以，可是应当把土地的分法讨论出来，秋后再动手分就晚了，免得种不上麦子”的意见。结果群众同意了，于是就召开了组长联席会，把支部意见作了一般的启发，回去后分组讨论，同时布置全体党员在各小组积极活动，把党的决议变成群众的决议。
    最后讨论结果，九个组同意支部的意见，两个组不同意支部的意见，一个组随大众，一个组没有办法，一个组主张秋后分地，三个组长因下雨没到会。
    根据最后组长的汇报，支部决议已取得大多数群众的同意，于是就召开了群众大会，公布了以上土地分配的方法，并加强了团结教育，公布后一般的贫农都说：“这样分怪合理哩！”中农也说：“咱有地，斗争的地就是该叫穷人种啊！”
    斗争的土地分配后，贫农四七八人，原有土地九○四亩，再加斗争果实土地五五一亩，就是四七八口人分一四五五亩土地，每人三亩，还可留下二十一亩地照顾逃难者，或进一步解决抗属土地问题。这样一来，上升中农的贫农，虽尚无作具体统计。总之，田庄群众经过这次反奸清算斗争后，几千年的封建剥削制度已经消灭了，农民们实现了耕者有其田。
