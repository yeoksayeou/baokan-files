【This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch of the 17th】 In Ji-Lu-Yu, a movement is being launched, "the masses cherish the military dependents, and the military dependents vigorously support the front lines." The masses in the sixth district of Hua County actively helped military dependents establish their households, distributing 4,557 mu of land, 19 shi of wheat, 19 buildings, and 81 tile-roofed houses to 521 military dependents. The amount of land they received exceeded that of the average person, and assistance was also provided for plowing. The military dependents held meetings to discuss intensifying support for the front lines, responding to the government's concern and the villagers' kindness. They decided to step up production, work harder, and provide more grain and supplies to the front lines, and participate more in transportation work. They also decided to jointly write letters to their children at the front, urging them to "not miss home, fight well, and only by defeating Chiang Kai-shek can we protect our chance to turn over a new leaf."

    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】冀鲁豫各地展开“群众爱护军属，军属极力支援前线”的运动。滑县六区群众积极帮助军属建立家务，给五百二十一户军属分了四千五百五十七亩土地，十九石麦子，十九间楼，八十一间瓦房。他们的土地数自己超过一般群众，并帮助解决了代耕问题。军属们分别开会商量加紧支援前线，回答政府的关心与乡亲们的盛意。决定好好生产，加劲干活，多拿粮食和东西供给前方，并多参加运输工作。还决定共同写信寄给前方的孩子们，嘱咐他们“不要想家，好好打仗，只有打败老蒋，才能保住翻身好时光。”
