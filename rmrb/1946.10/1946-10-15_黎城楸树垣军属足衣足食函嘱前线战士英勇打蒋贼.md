Now, the village has helped him open up dozens of mu of wasteland, and he is now able to have enough food and clothing. When they heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas, they were all indignant and wrote letters to their relatives on the front lines, urging them to fight bravely and defeat the Chiang army. Honorary serviceman Niu Fuchen said, "I will definitely help with the armed work and improve the combat skills of the militia. As long as we can do it, we will do our best." (Wang Changqun)

　　黎城楸树垣军属足衣足食函嘱前线战士英勇打蒋贼
    【本报黎城讯】三区楸树垣村军属干属及荣退军人，在政府与群众热烈帮助下，已建立了足衣足食的新光景。廿七户中，八户做到耕一余一，三户做到耕二余一，十一户做到耕三余一，四户做到够吃够穿。另有牛登逵一户，家里没人。四亩半地由村人代耕，今年收粮五石，亦由村内保管。军属李德友以前是赤贫，儿子放羊，自己讨饭，现在村里帮他开了几十亩荒地，已能足衣足食。他们听说蒋介石进攻解放区，莫不气愤，纷纷写信给前线亲属嘱咐他们英勇作战，打退蒋军。荣誉军人牛福辰说：“我一定好好帮助武装工作，提高民兵作战技术。只要能干的都尽力地去干。”（王长群）
