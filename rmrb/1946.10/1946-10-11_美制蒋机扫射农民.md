　　[Dispatch from this newspaper in Handan, 8th] To coordinate with ground offensives, US-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft have been strafing peaceful residents in the Liberated Areas for days. On September 22nd, two Chiang Kai-shek aircraft flew from the southwest over Taipingji, Juye. At the time, local people were busy with the autumn harvest and threshing. The Chiang Kai-shek aircraft immediately dropped large bombs on the peasants threshing grain and a group of playing children outside the east gate. Eleven men, women, old and young were killed on the spot, and many were injured. After the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft left, an old woman crawled out of the crowd and recognized her two grandsons among the dead. She cried in agony, almost fainting, and said, "Chiang Kai-shek, I curse you for bombing my two good grandsons to death. I will risk my old life to fight you to the end!"
