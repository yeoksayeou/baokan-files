Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. According to the Shanghai newspaper, peasant uprisings are increasingly developing in Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other areas along the Jinghu Railway. The Chiang faction's "Yanggou (drainage ditch) Suppression Headquarters" sent a large number of troops last month to carry out "suppression," and paratrooper units stationed in Wuxi and other places were also dispatched to cooperate, with a plan to complete the "suppression" by the end of September. The peasant uprising forces were forced to rise up in self-defense, launching mobile attacks or safely transferring under the cover of the local people. Now the Kuomintang's "suppression" plan has been miserably defeated, and the activities of the peasant uprising forces are more active than before. The Kunshan Li Dexue Department People's Armed Forces, with more than 30 people, carrying three machine guns and rifles, disguised themselves as "suppression" troops on October 2nd and raided Xiemaqiao Town in the county, engaging in fierce battles with local police and self-defense forces. As a result, they seized 32 handguns. At 7 p.m. that day, the unit raided Yanghu, killing 11 self-defense team members before safely retreating into Dianshan Lake. Around October 5th, four ships were attacked by peasant uprisings in Sijiangkou between Kunshan and Qingpu, Luhu near Dian Lake, and Sanmaigang at the mouth of Dianshan Lake. In addition, a peasant uprising attack on a ship occurred in Fangmatan, Jiangyin on September 22nd. The pistol at the guard post of the Wuhu Self-Defense Force was also seized by peasant uprisings on October 5th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. According to a report in the Tianjin Dagongbao on October 16th: The Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters reported to the Provincial参议会 (Provincial Senate) on the 7th of this month, revealing that the more than 10,000-strong People's Armed Forces in western Yunnan are the Miao ethnic group, known for their bravery and fighting skills. Their leaders are Yu Tihuai, Haiqing, Hu Laka, and Yang A’du, who are active in the Yunling Mountains near Yongsheng. In the Sier area of western Yunnan, there are also several units led by Gao Cairan and Gao Ruyun, all fully equipped with firearms. The Provincial Garrison Headquarters admitted that the People's Armed Forces in eastern Yunnan number about 2,000 in total. However, it also claimed that Tao Yongzhong's unit alone could "muster a crowd" of more than 1,000 people at any time, indicating that the total number of units is definitely more than 2,000. In addition to Tao, there are also Zhao Huanran, An Bangdu, You Yaolong, Wei Guangxing, etc., among which the An Bangdu unit is a barbarian force. In southern Yunnan, there are units led by He Guangrong, Luo Rihui, Long Yonghe, Bai Xiaoqi, and Xu Si Laoban, totaling about 1,400 people (Note: The Provincial Garrison Headquarters has secretly concealed the fact that the Yi and Han peasant uprising forces led by Lu Xiqi in Qiaojia County, northern Yunnan, number more than 1,000). The Provincial Garrison Headquarters listed the weapons of the above-mentioned units as including cannons, mortars, submachine guns, light and heavy machine guns, and rifles. The report also stated that many garrison troops have been transferred elsewhere in recent months, resulting in fewer troops and insufficient distribution, which has given the "demon barbarians" an opportunity to exploit. Impoverished people are ostensibly civilians but secretly make a living as "bandits." These "scattered bandits" appear and disappear unpredictably, making them difficult to suppress.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. According to news from various newspapers and periodicals: Guangdong People's Armed Forces are spread throughout the southwest, west, and vast areas of the south and north of the province. In the Shiwandashan area near Qin County at the junction of southwestern Guangdong and Guangxi, there are two units of the People's Army, totaling more than 2,000 people. One is the "Fangcheng Detachment" organized by young people in Fangcheng last spring to resist Japanese invaders, and the other is the "South Road Liberation Army" established by former General Zhang Yan. This spring, the two units repelled attacks by Chen Gongxia's 64th Army of the Chiang army and the 1st Regiment of the Guangdong Security Forces, and continued to develop. In the vast area north of the Xijiang River in western Guangdong, including Guangning, Deqing, and Sihui, there is the "Xijiang People's Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army" formed by Guangning educated youth and farmers. The team was established in January last year, and after the war, it has thwarted more than 100 large and small attacks by the Chiang army. It has also persuaded landlords to appropriately reduce rent and interest. In the spring, when there was a severe famine, it provided relief to refugees through methods such as soliciting donations and reducing its own food consumption, which has won the love of local farmers and landlords. On Hainan Island, there is a unit of fishermen's armed forces, whose strength is growing. In mid-September, more than 100 members of the unit captured a warship of the Kuomintang Navy Headquarters named "Haixing" in Diao Ao. On the south bank of the Dongjiang River, there is the "Relief Army," in the Pearl River Delta there is the "Five Dragons Hall," and on the Leizhou Peninsula, there is also a unit of the People's Armed Forces. According to a spokesman for the Guangdong Security Headquarters, speaking to reporters from the News Daily, all these troops have new equipment such as cannons and machine guns. In addition, there is a unit of the People's Armed Forces at the junction of northern Guangdong and Hunan Province that travels between the two provinces, making it extremely difficult for the Chiang army to "suppress."

　　京沪沿线变民机动出击
    云南苗民武装抗蒋
    粤人民武装推行减租息深得民心海南岛渔民武装曾夺获蒋家军舰
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据沪报透露，京沪沿线昆山、苏州、无锡一带，民变武装日益发展。蒋方“阳沟清剿指挥部”上月曾派大批部队进行“清剿”，驻于无锡等地的伞兵队亦出动配合，并定九月底完成“清剿”计划。各该变民部队被迫奋起自卫，纷纷机动出击，或在当地人民掩护下安全转移。现国民党的“清剿”计划已遭惨败，而民变武装之活动则较前更加活跃。昆山李德学部人民武装三十余名，十月二日携机枪三挺及长短枪，化装“清剿”部队，一度袭入该县歇马桥镇，与当地警察及自卫队激战，结果缴获手枪三十二支。当天下午七时，该部又袭入杨湖一地，击毙自卫队十一名，然后安全撤入淀山湖。十月五日前后，昆山、清浦间的泗江口，淀湖附近的芦墟，淀山湖口的三浼港等地，先后有轮船四艘被变民袭击。此外，江阴放马滩亦于九月二十二日发生变民袭击轮船事件。芜湖自卫队门岗的驳壳枪亦于十月五日被变民夺取。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据十月十六日天津大公报消息：滇省警备司令部于本月七日对省参议会报告中，泄露滇西之万余人民部队乃夷族之一的苗夷武装，强悍善斗，首领为余涕淮海清、胡拉卡、羊阿都，活动于永胜附近的云岭山地。滇西思洱区尚有高彩然、高汝云等数部，枪械俱全。滇东之人民武装，据该司令部承认，约二千人，共为全部。但又称仅陶永忠一部即可随时“啸众”千余人，显见各部总数决不止二千。除陶外，尚有赵焕然、安邦都、游耀龙、魏光兴等，其中安邦都部系蛮族部队。滇南有贺光荣、罗日辉、龙永和、白小七、许四老板等部，共约一千四百余人，（按：滇北巧家县陆锡歧所部夷汉变民武装千余人，该司令部尚秘而不宜）。该司令部列举上述各部的武器计有大炮、迫击炮、冲锋枪、轻重机枪及长短枪等。报告中又称：数月来警备部队他调者甚多，兵力较少，不敷分配，致予“妖夷”以可乘之机，穷苦人民明则为民，暗则以“匪”为生。此类“散匪”出没无定，不易清剿。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据各地报刊消息：广东人民武装遍布该省西南部西部与南北广大地区。西南粤桂交界处，钦县附近之十万大山一带，有民军两部，共二千余人，一为去春防城青年为抵抗日寇而组织的“防城支队”，一为前张炎将军所建立的“南路解放军”，该两部曾于今春击退蒋军六十四军军长陈公侠所部及广东保安第一团等部的进攻，而继续发展。西部西江以北广宁、德庆、四会一带辽阔地区，有广宁知识青年与农民联合组成的“西江人民抗日义勇队”，该队成立于去年一月，在战后曾粉碎蒋军百余次大小进攻，并劝告地主适当减租减息，又于今春当地灾荒吃紧之际，曾以劝捐救饥及自己节食等办法救济难民，深得地方农民与地主的爱戴。海南岛有渔民武装一部，声势日壮，九月中旬该部百余人曾在大澳夺获国民党海军总部名叫“海兴”的军舰一艘。东江南岸有“救济军”，珠江三角洲上有“五龙堂”，雷洲半岛亦有人民武装一部。据粤保安司令部发言人告新闻报记者称，这一处队伍都有大炮机枪等新式装备。此外粤北与湘省交界处有人民武装一部来往于两省之间，使“进剿”的蒋军困难万端。
