Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today issued the following statement on the current situation:

　　Since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party has hoped to cooperate with Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek to realize the arduous task of domestic peace and democracy, and for this purpose, it has not hesitated to make repeated concessions. In August of last year, our Party Chairman Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing for negotiations for more than 40 days, and implemented the withdrawal of troops who had contributed to the War of Resistance from Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Hunan, Southern Hubei, and Western Henan, as the first concession, and obtained the signing of the Summary of Talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Unfortunately, the day after the Summary of Talks was published, Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of U.S. military aid, issued a so-called "bandit suppression" order, causing the tragic civil war to spread across the country for three months. Although Chiang Kai-shek was so untrustworthy, and the U.S. government was so unjust, our Party continued its peaceful efforts, and finally on January 10th of this year, the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the U.S. jointly signed a ceasefire order, stipulating that all military conflicts and military deployments across the country would cease after January 13th, and allowed the Chiang side to send five armies to the Northeast before the ceasefire, which was the second concession made by our Party. On January 31st, the Political Consultative Conference, composed of representatives of China's major parties and social figures, unanimously passed five resolutions, and our Party made a third concession, especially the concession on the so-called old representatives of the National Assembly, which was the most important. At this time, the Kuomintang forces had violated the ceasefire order and continued military offensives in the Northeast, Rehe, Hubei, Guangdong and other places. The Chongqing Incident which sabotaged the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the New China Daily Incident also occurred in Chongqing. However, our Party made a fourth concession and signed an extremely compromising troop reorganization plan with the Kuomintang and the U.S. on February 25th. However, the Kuomintang's military offensives, military deployments, and political reaction became even more intensified. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang openly demanded the overthrow of the ceasefire order, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the troop reorganization plan, and the U.S. military aid to the Chiang side was even greater than during the Hurley period. On March 27th, the CPC made a fifth concession, allowing the Northeast to maintain the status quo at that time rather than on January 13th, but although this agreement was also formally signed by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the U.S., the Kuomintang immediately and thoroughly destroyed it, launching a large-scale offensive in the Northeast, and the U.S. turned a blind eye. In June, the CPC made a sixth concession on various issues in the negotiations, but Chiang Kai-shek suddenly raised five unreasonable demands through the U.S., making all negotiations completely ineffective. Since then, with the continued massive aid of the U.S., Chiang's army has arbitrarily launched offensives throughout the country. In order to express the seventh concession, our Party again agreed to participate in the informal five-person talks on the reorganization of the government on the condition of guaranteeing a ceasefire, but this minimum condition was rejected by both Chiang and the U.S. In late September, Chiang's army began to attack Zhangjiakou. Our Party could no longer bear it and formally notified that if this offensive was not stopped, it would be a sign that the Chiang side was determined to completely break down. The joint response from Chiang and the U.S. was an ultimatum to accept Chiang Kai-shek's harsh demands within ten days. Our Party made an eighth concession, only asking the Chiang side to cancel the attack on Zhangjiakou, and our Party could participate in the three-person military talks and the five-person political talks. This proposal was ultimately rejected by both Chiang and the U.S., and Chiang's army occupied Zhangjiakou on the 11th of this month. All the above facts prove that what Chiang and the U.S. are pursuing is only the investment and elimination of China's democratic movement, and only Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous, reactionary dictatorship. The military actions of Chiang and the U.S. are for this purpose. All their so-called political solutions and peaceful mediation are also for this purpose, but to cover up and adjust with military actions. As long as they do not abandon this goal, then every concession that our Party has made with the utmost benevolence and righteousness will not only fail to satisfy their desires, but also make them think that this is a weakness that the Chinese people can deceive, but instead encourage them to gain an inch and demand a foot, and will not stop until our Party is forced to sell out all the interests of the people, and will not stop until our Party and the Chinese democratic movement are completely eliminated. Therefore, the Chiang side is now everywhere in the country attacking, conscripting soldiers, collecting grain, and destroying national, civil, and people's livelihoods, and unilaterally ordering the convening of the so-called National Assembly; the U.S. side also firmly refuses to withdraw troops and stop aid, showing that they have absolutely no intention of peace and democracy. Under this dangerous situation, the people of the whole country all hope that our Party will uphold justice and avert disaster, and our Party also vows to do its best to fulfill the people's expectations and fight to the end. Recently, some third-party people are making final efforts to save peace. In order to deceive the people once again and achieve his own ambitions, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately put on a peaceful posture and announced his eight conditions for peace on the 16th of this month. Our Party believes that as long as Chiang Kai-shek is willing to achieve real and effective peace under the pressure of the people, our Party can also not blame the past and re-negotiate. However, in the past fourteen months, any solemn orders, promises, and guarantees can be torn up at will, then today's agreement will become waste paper tomorrow; today there are five or eight requirements, and tomorrow there may be fifty or eighty requirements. Our Party really cannot bear to make our suffering people accept this shameful deception again. Therefore, our Party has no other requirements, but only requires the restoration of credibility first. What is the sacred standard of credibility today? This is the ceasefire order personally signed by Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Marshall on January 10th, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference unanimously passed by Chiang Kai-shek and all the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference on January 31st. In order to show the final and greatest concession, our Party solemnly declares that if all talks today are to have real results, the sacred effect of the ceasefire and the Political Consultative Conference agreements must be recognized, that is, it must be recognized that the restoration of the military positions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on January 13th is the criterion for all military consultations; it must be recognized that the implementation of all resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is the criterion for all political consultations. Our Party believes that Chiang Kai-shek and Marshall should value their own credibility and personality, and there is no reason to overturn the sacred agreement they signed. As long as they have this minimum sincerity, our Party will definitely continue to cooperate with them to seek the real realization of peace and the real beginning of democracy. Our Party believes that justice will eventually triumph over everything, and the Chinese people's just efforts to seek peace and democracy, no matter what kind of difficulties and twists and turns they will go through, will eventually be able to restore the full effect of the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and is willing to encourage each other with patriots and people of insight across the country.

　　中国共产党中央委员会
    发表对时局声明
    蒋美在在表示决无和平民主意图国人均希我党坚持正义力挽狂澜
    【新华社延安十七日电】中国共产党中央委员会今日发表对时局声明如下：
    本党于抗日战争结束以后，即希与国民党领袖蒋介石合作，以实现国内和平民主的艰巨努力，为此并曾不惜再三让步。去年八月，本党主席毛泽东亲赴重庆谈判四十余日，并实行自浙江、苏南、皖南、湖南、鄂南、豫西撤退抗日有功之军队，以此第一次让步，获得国共会谈纪要的签订。不幸会谈纪要公布次日，蒋介石即因得美国军事援助，发出所谓“剿匪”手令，致悲惨的内战仍蔓延全国三个月之久。蒋介石虽如此背信，美政府虽如此不义，本党仍继续和平努力，卒于本年一月十日由国共美三方共同签署停战命令，规定一月十三日后全国停止一切军事冲突与军事调动，并允蒋方在停战前得派五个军至东北，是为本党的第二次让步。一月三十一日，中国各主要党派与社会贤达代表所组成的政治协商会议，以全体一致通过五项决议，于此本党又作了第三次让步，尤以对所谓国大旧代表问题之让步为最重要。此时国方在东北、热河、湖北、广东等地，已破坏停战令，继续军事进攻，在重庆又发生破坏政协决议的较场口惨案与新华日报惨案，但本党又作第四次让步，于二月二十五日与国美两方签署了极端委曲求全的整军方案，乃蒋方的军事进攻、军事调动与政治反动，竟变本加厉，国民党二中全会公开要求推翻停战令、政协决议与整军方案，而美国对蒋方的军事援助，亦较赫尔利时期更甚。三月二十七日，中共作第五次让步，允许东北维持当时的而非一月十三日的状况，但此项协定虽亦由国共美三方正式签字，国方却立即予以彻底破坏，在东北大举进攻，而美方亦熟视无睹。六月间，中共在谈判中，对各项问题又作第六次让步，乃蒋介石忽经过美方提出五项无理要求，致一切商谈完全无效。此后蒋军在美方继续大量援助之下，在全国各地恣意进攻，本党为表示第七次让步，又允许在保证停战条件下，参加关于改组政府的五人非正式会谈，此种最低条件竟亦为蒋美两方所拒绝。九月下旬，蒋军开始攻击张家口，本党忍无可忍，乃正式通知此项进攻如不停止，即为蒋方决心全面破裂的表示。而蒋美两方的共同答复，竟为限期十日接受蒋介石苛刻要求的最后通牒，本党复作第八次让步，仅要求蒋方取消进攻张家口，本党即可参加三人军事会谈与五人政治会谈，此项提议终仍为蒋美两方拒绝，蒋军并于本月十一日占领张家口。上述一切事实，证明蒋美两方所追求的，只是中国民主运动的投资与消灭，只是蒋介石的卖国反动独裁。蒋美两方的军事行动，固为此目的，其一切所谓政治解决，和平调处，亦莫不为此目的，不过与军事行动相掩护相调剂而已。只要他们不放弃此项目的，则本党每一次仁至义尽的让步，不但不能满足他们的欲望，并且使他们认为这是中国人民可欺的弱点，反而鼓励他们得寸进尺，非迫使本党出卖人民一切利益不止，非迫使本党与中国民主运动完全消灭不止。因此蒋方现正在全国到处进攻、征兵、征粮、摧残民族、民权、民生，并单独下令召集所谓国民大会；美方亦坚不撤兵停援，在在表示他们决无和平民主的意图。在此种险恶局势下，全国人民均希本党坚持正义，力挽狂澜，本党亦誓为人民的期望竭智尽思奋斗到底。近日若干第三方面人士正作挽救和平的最后努力，蒋介石为了再一次蒙蔽人民，以达到自己的野心，乃故意装出和平姿态，于本月十六日宣布其和平的八项条件。本党认为只要蒋介石在人民压力之下愿意实现真实有效的和平，则本党亦可不咎既往，从新协商。但在过去十四个月中，任何庄严的命令、诺言与保证，既可任意撕毁，则今日的协议，明日又成废纸；今日有五项、八项要求，明日又可有五十项、八十项要求，本党诚不忍再使我痛苦的人民作接受此项可耻的欺骗。所以本党没有旁的要求，只要求首先恢复信义，今日信义的神圣标准为何？这就是一月十日蒋介石、毛泽东、马歇尔三人亲自签署的停战令与一月三十一日蒋介石和全体政协代表一致通过的政协决议。本党为表示最后最大让步计，兹特郑重声明：今日一切会谈如欲其有真实结果，必须承认停战、政协两协定的神圣效力，即承认恢复一月十三日国共双方军事位置，为一切军事商谈的准则；承认实行政协一切决议，为一切政治商谈的准则。本党认为蒋介石与马歇尔应该重视自己的信义和人格，没有任何理由推翻自己所签字的神圣协定。只要他们有这种最低限度的诚意，本党一定继续与他们通力合作，以求和平的真正实现，民主的真正开始。本党相信正义终必战胜一切，中国人民求取和平民主的正义努力，无论将经过何种艰难曲折，最后必能恢复停战令与政协决议的全部效力，愿与全国志士仁人共勉之。
