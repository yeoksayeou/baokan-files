　　New Medical Treatment Shows Rapid Results
    Discharged Wounded Eager to Return to the Battlefield
    [Report from our Correspondents on the 7th] The field headquarters' Ministry of Health's hospitals have already cured hundreds of wounded soldiers in twenty days, accounting for 39% of those admitted. On the morning of the 14th, these strong men happily and excitedly rushed to the hospital department to collect their discharge certificates. Comrade Wang Lixiu, a artillery platoon leader from a certain unit, clamored to be discharged as soon as he recovered from his injuries, saying, "Most of the comrades in my platoon are new, and I want to go back quickly to lead them to win battles. Many comrades are eager to return to their units as soon as their injuries heal, but the unit refuses to accept them because they don't have a discharge certificate, so they have to return to the hospital. Those who have been injured before feel that this treatment is particularly effective, which is the result of using new treatments. Once, due to an emergency, the hospital moved in the rain, and some of the wounded walked to the destination, but the suppuration rate is now only 4.6%, so the new treatment is welcomed by all the wounded and sick soldiers.

　　新法医疗收效极快
    出院伤员争赴战场
    【本报记者团七日电】野战总卫生部所属各医院，在二十天中已治愈伤员数百名，占收容数的百分之三十九。十四日早晨这些健儿们都愉快而兴奋的争着到院部领取出院证。某部一炮兵排长王立秀同志刚养好伤就嚷着要出院说：“俺排里大部分是新同志，我要赶快回去领导他们打胜仗，不少同志伤刚好就急着归队，但是部队因为他没有出院证不收他，只好又回到医院。过去负过伤的感到这次治疗收效特快，这是运用新治疗法的结果。有一次因情况紧急医院冒雨转移，有些伤员们步行到目的地，但到现在化脓数仅占百分之四点六，因此新治疗法受到全体伤病员的欢迎。
