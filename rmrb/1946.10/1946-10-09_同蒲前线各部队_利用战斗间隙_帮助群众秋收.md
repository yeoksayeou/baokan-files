　　Frontline Troops on the Tongpu Railway
    Utilize Combat Intervals
    to Assist the Masses with the Autumn Harvest
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng, 7th dispatch] The Political Department of the Eighth Route Army on the Tongpu Front recently called on all troops to use the intervals between battles to spend half their day helping the masses near their stationed areas with the autumn harvest and sowing, and to lend all their livestock to the masses for planting. All officers and soldiers responded enthusiastically with practical actions. The rear personnel of the × Brigade, stationed in × Village, totaling one hundred and fifty people, helped the masses harvest over six hundred mu of autumn crops even before receiving the call. After the Chenyan battle, the First Battalion of the × Regiment, disregarding their fatigue, also voluntarily helped the masses of × Village with the harvesting starting on the 27th. The troops stationed in × Village wrote on the blackboard bulletin: "Comrades who are sowing wheat are welcome to come and get livestock." A campaign to rush the harvest and sowing has been launched in villages in this area with the participation of the troops. In the bountiful fields, the military and the civilians are all busy, laughing and saying: "We'll help you carry stretchers, you help us with the autumn harvest and sowing wheat." "Let's unite closely and eliminate the invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops!"

　　同蒲前线各部队
    利用战斗间隙
    帮助群众秋收
    【本报阳城七日电】同蒲前线八路军政治部日前号召各部队利用战斗空隙，抽出下半天时间，帮助驻地附近群众秋收秋种，并将全部牲口借给群众种。各部队官兵都以实际行动热烈响应。×旅留守于×村之后方人员一百五十人，在未接到号召前即帮助群众收秋六百余亩。×团一营于陈堰战斗后，不顾疲劳，亦于二十七日起，自动帮助×村群众收割。×村驻军在黑板报上写着：“请种麦群众自动来拉牲口。”这一带村庄已在部队参加下掀起抢收抢种运动。丰收的田野中，军民一齐忙碌着，说笑着：“我们帮你们抬担架，你们帮我们收秋种麦。”“大家结合得紧紧的，消灭进犯的蒋伪军！”
