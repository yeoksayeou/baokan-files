　　【Report from the Jilu豫 Front Reporter Corps, 19th】 Numerous officers and soldiers with conscience and passion within Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage have recently raised the banner of anti-civil war and joined the people's ranks. On the 8th, Chen Shijie, a machine gunner of the 9th Squad of the 9th Company of the 32nd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the 11th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage, led eight brothers including Lu Chenglin of his squad, carrying one American-made machine gun and five rifles, in an anti-civil war uprising on the battlefield. Liang Jingfang, the squad leader of the 8th Squad of the 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 118th Brigade, and others also gloriously revolted against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek during the fierce battle at Zhangfengji. Chen Shijie said: The 11th Division was personally trained by Chen Cheng and is known as the elite among the elite, but they rape and plunder the common people everywhere. The officers in the unit do not treat their subordinates as human beings, which is worse than other units. He said, "We are Chinese. We can no longer bear to use American weapons to treat our compatriots so cruelly." He said that now the brothers in the Central Army are gradually recognizing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous features. Which Chinese with a sense of honor is willing to be a running dog for the United States and die for them?!"

　　冀鲁豫前线激战中
    蒋军两班战场起义
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十九日电】蒋介石嫡系内部无数有良心有热血的官兵，近日纷纷高举反内战义旗，投到人民队伍中来。八日蒋介石嫡系十一师十一旅三十二团九连九班机枪射手陈世杰率该班芦成林等八个弟兄，携美式机枪一挺、步枪五枝，在战场举行反内战起义，其一一八旅五十四团三营八连八班长梁景芳等多人亦在张风集激战时反对卖国贼蒋介石光荣举义。陈世杰说：十一师是陈诚一手训练出来，号称精锐中的精锐，可是对老百姓到处奸淫掳掠，部队内官长对下级不当人看，比其他部分都厉害。他说：“我们是中国人，再不忍拿着美国武器，对自己的同胞这样残忍下去了，他说现今中央军里的弟兄们都逐渐认识了蒋介石这副汉奸嘴脸了。那一个有血性的中国人，还愿替美国当走狗去送死呢！？”
