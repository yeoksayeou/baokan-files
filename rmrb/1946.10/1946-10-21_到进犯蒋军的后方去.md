　　Go to the Rear of the Invading Chiang Army
    Liberation Daily October 18th Commentary

    After Chiang Kai-shek occupied the empty city of Zhangjiakou, he launched a grandiloquent "peace offensive" to cover up his larger-scale military operations. The military and civilians in the Liberated Areas saw through his trickery, and their answer was resolute and comprehensive resistance. In the past few days, good news has kept pouring in. In addition to the front lines in areas such as Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shandong, and the Ping-Sui Railway Line, where thousands upon thousands of invading troops have been annihilated, a new phenomenon is emerging: many well-trained armed units of the People's Liberation Army are penetrating deep into the rear of the Chiang army, wiping out the defending enemy and recovering vast areas of lost territory. In early October, the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Liberated Area, which serves as the corridor between North China and Northeast China, the Eighth Route Army and guerrillas launched proactive attacks, annihilating three or four regiments of the Chiang army's main force and local armed forces. They successively captured Ningcheng and Jianchang, and liberated vast rural areas of Ji County, Xianghe, Lulong, Luan County, and Leting, clearing out many isolated strongholds of the Chiang and puppet troops. Even the Chiang family county government in Leting had to abandon the city and flee to Luan County. Similar victories have been achieved in areas such as Jiangsu-Anhui, southern Shanxi, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and western Suiyuan. In these areas behind the Chiang army, the Chiang army only "symbolically" occupies a few isolated cities, while the vast majority of villages and towns are under our control. The decrees of the democratic government are still implemented without obstruction, the peasants have carried out or are carrying out land reform, the production movement is still underway, and women and children are still loudly singing the name of Chairman Mao, "Firmly follow Chairman Mao!"

    Chiang Kai-shek's "ambition" is to swallow up the Liberated Areas in one gulp, but the facts have ruthlessly exposed this paper tiger raised by American imperialism. Although he can concentrate "superior" forces and rely on his American daddy's weapons and equipment to temporarily occupy some towns in the Liberated Areas, he can never consolidate the occupied areas, just like the Japanese. Why? Firstly, because the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek is an unjust war of treasonous dictatorship and opposition to the people, and the opponent he is facing is the entire population of the Liberated Areas who have been awakened through eight years of the War of Resistance and land reform. The people of the Liberated Areas absolutely cannot tolerate the criminal rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the murderer. Chiang Kai-shek is 100% isolated among the people. Many captured Chiang army officers have personally experienced that wherever the Chiang army goes, the people disappear, taking even their pots, bowls, and spoons with them; as soon as the people's army arrives, the people gather around, join the ranks of battle, and solve the supply problems for the troops. Even if a few individuals are fooled by special agents and have some illusions about the Chiang army before it arrives, the Chiang army's heinous crimes of rape, plunder, killing, and arson, like those of the Japanese invaders in the past, tear off their masks and wipe out the political deception carried out by the special agents. The illusions of those who were deceived are shattered, and they quickly and firmly return to the side of the people. As the indignation of the masses of all strata continues to rise, the Chiang army encounters widespread resistance. Secondly, the Chiang army lacks troops, its rear is empty, and its defensive strength is weak. For example, only a few battalions are stationed in Lingshan and Zishan in the Jiangsu-Anhui border area, and there is only one squad from Zhuozishan to Guihua on the Ping-Sui Railway. When the 94th Army and others were transferred to attack Huailai, the Beining Railway was in a precarious state. Although Chiang Kai-shek also knows this weakness, he must concentrate his forces to attack forward, so he absolutely cannot spare troops to defend every inch of land. This gives the main force, guerrillas, and militia of the Liberated Areas extensive opportunities for activity. Moreover, most of the Chiang army soldiers are unwilling to die for a dictator, and desertions occur constantly along the way. Under the resolute resistance of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, they will inevitably lay down their weapons in large numbers. Therefore, the Chiang army invading the Liberated Areas can only occupy a few points and lines, while the vast majority of the area remains in the hands of the people's army, and even the occupation of these points and lines is not solid. The military and civilians in the Liberated Areas persist in fighting and insist on annihilating the enemy's vital forces. We are fully confident of finally recovering all lost territory.

    The above shows that we have won "the right timing, geographical advantages, and the support of the people." We have favorable conditions and full confidence to launch widespread guerrilla warfare in the Chiang army's occupied areas. We will implement comprehensive and resolute resistance. On the front, when we plan to withdraw from towns, in addition to inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, we must implement a thorough scorched earth policy, like in Chengde and Huaiyin, leaving not a grain of food, not a single blade of grass, and not even letting them use a single bed board, so that the Chiang army gains nothing. At the same time, each Liberated Area should send well-trained small armed units or armed work teams to the rear of the invading Chiang army to combine with the local militia and guerrillas, protect the interests of the masses, sabotage the Chiang army's supply and communication lines, attack isolated strongholds, and constantly annihilate small groups of the enemy. This will carry out countless small-scale annihilation battles to coordinate with large-scale mobile warfare to annihilate large numbers of the enemy. When the Chiang army's vital forces are reduced to a certain extent, the Liberated Areas can launch a large-scale counter-offensive and finally drive out the Chiang army and recover all lost territory. The world does not belong to the Chiang family; it must belong to the people.

　　到进犯蒋军的后方去
    解放日报十八日时评
    蒋介石在侵陷张家口一座空城以后，便发出洋洋盈耳的“和平攻势”，来掩盖他更大规模的军事行动。解放区军民洞烛其奸，他们的回答是坚决的全面抵抗。这几天捷报不断传来，除了前线如冀鲁豫、山东、平绥线成千成千的歼灭进犯军外，一个新的现象，是人民解放军许多精干武装深入蒋军后方，歼灭守备之敌，收复了广大的失地。本月上旬，作为华北与东北走廊的冀热辽解放区，八路军和游击队，主动出击，歼灭了蒋军三四个团的主力和地方武装，相继袭克宁城、建昌，光复了蓟县、香河、卢龙、滦县和乐亭的广大乡村，扫清了许多蒋伪孤立据点，连乐亭蒋家县政府只得弃城逃向滦县，其他如苏皖、晋南、冀鲁豫和绥西等地，都有同样的胜利。在这些地区的蒋军后方，蒋军除了“象征”占领几座孤城外，广大的村镇都在我控制中。那里民主政府的政令照常通行无阻，农民已经进行了或正在进行着土地改革，生产运动仍然开展着，妇女儿童仍在响亮地歌唱着毛主席的名字，“坚决跟毛主席走”！
    蒋介石的“雄心”是想一口把解放区吞没，但事实却无情地撕破了美帝国主义豢养的这只纸老虎。虽然他可以集中“优势”兵力凭借洋爸爸的武器装备，暂时占领解放区一些城镇，可是却正像日本人一样，绝对无法巩固占领区。为什么？一是因为蒋介石所发动的内战是卖国独裁与民为敌的不义战争，而所遇到的对手却是解放区经过八年抗战与土地改革觉悟了的全体人民。解放区人民是绝对无法忍受蒋介石杀人犯的罪恶统治的，蒋介石在人民中是百分之百孤立的，很多被俘的蒋军军官都曾经亲身经验过，蒋军到处，老百姓连人连锅碗盆勺都不见踪影；人民军队一到，老百姓就聚拢走来，参加战斗行列，解决部队给养；即有个别分子受特务愚弄，在蒋军未到以前对之存在若干幻想，但像过去日寇一样，蒋军的奸淫掳劫杀人放火的强盗罪行，撕毁了他们的面具，把特务所作的政治欺骗一笔消毁，被骗者的幻想破灭了，很快坚定地回到人民方面来。如此各阶层群众的义愤不断高涨，蒋军所遇到的是普遍的反抗。二是蒋军兵力不足，后方空虚，守备力量薄弱，如苏皖边区灵山与资山，只各驻有几个营，平绥路上卓资山到归绥只有一个班，九十四军等调攻怀来时，北宁路就在风雨飘摇中。蒋介石虽然亦知道这个弱点，但他既要集中兵力向前进攻，就绝对无法分出兵力保守每一寸土地，这样就使得解放区主力兵团游击队民兵有了广泛活动机会，何况蒋军士兵大多不愿为独夫卖命，沿途不断发生逃亡，遇到解放区军民的坚决抗击之下，自必大批放下武器。所以侵入解放区的蒋军，仅仅能够占领若干点线，广大的面仍在人民军队手中，而这些点线的占领亦是不坚固的。解放区军民坚持战斗，坚持消灭敌人的有生力量。最后收复一切失地是完全有把握的。
    上述种种，证明我们赢得“天时地利人和”，我们具有有利条件和充分信心在蒋军侵占区广泛发动游击战争。我们实行全面坚决抵抗，在正面，当我们有计划撤离城镇时，除了给敌人以大量杀伤外，要实行彻底的坚壁清野，如承德、淮阴那样不留一颗粮食，不给一根马草，连睡觉的床板都不让应用一块，使蒋军一无所获。同时各解放区都派遣精悍的小型武装或是武装工作队，到进犯蒋军的后方去，结合当地的民兵游击队，保护群众利益，破坏蒋军补给联络线，袭击孤立据点，不断消灭小股敌人，这样进行无数的小规模歼灭战，以配合歼灭大量敌人的大规模运动战。蒋军有生力量损失到一定程度时，解放区便可以大举反攻，最后把蒋军赶出去，收复一切失地。天下不是蒋家的，一定是属于人民的。
