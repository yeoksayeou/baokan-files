　　American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy

　　The American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy is one of the groups that initiated the "U.S. Troops Out of China Week." It was founded last summer by scholars and celebrities with expertise in the Far East and Sino-American issues. Famous journalists Snow, Stein, Einstein, Meile, Forman, Strong, and Stokedu are all members. The famous Black singer Robeson is also involved. The host is Rear Admiral Evans Carlson, who has now retired. During the early days of China's Anti-Japanese War, Carlson served as the U.S. Embassy's naval attaché in China and visited our Liberated Areas. The association was originally named "Committee for a Democratic China Policy" but changed to its current name four days after its establishment. The scope of research extends from Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Indonesia, but China remains the main focus. The purpose of the association is to promote a democratic policy towards the Far East by the U.S. government. The main tasks include: (1) Educating the American public by providing them with accurate information about the Far East. (2) Mobilizing American public opinion to compel the U.S. government to adopt a democratic policy. The association publishes two types of publications: one is a press release, which is distributed to newspaper editors, radio broadcasters, and writers; the other is a monthly report, which contains systematic research articles. The association's headquarters are in New York, and branches are located in Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, and other places. A general meeting was held in New York this spring, attended by thousands of people. Snow and White both delivered speeches. Many Americans assist in the association's work, some voluntarily go to the association's office to serve, even doing trivial matters such as mopping the floor and stamping stamps, in order to save expenses. The association also launched "Withdraw from China Week," which was responded to by thirty-five cities. Prior to this, the association held a rally in New York attended by 90,000 people, the main purpose of which was to demand that the U.S. government change its current foreign policy.
