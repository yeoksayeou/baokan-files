　　Trusting the Government's Policy of Developing Industry and Commerce
　　Jincheng Merchants Form Their Own Business Association
　　Explicitly Stipulating the Protection of Various Freedoms of Shop Assistants and Actively Mediating More Than 100 Cases of Wage Issues
　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 9th] After the government representative presented three guarantees at the merchants' symposium in Jincheng last month (guaranteeing that mass liquidation demands would never harm industrial and commercial interests; abolishing the special rights of state-owned stores; shop assistants and apprentices would not be held accountable for old debts, and requiring merchants to enforce laws and not illegally mistreat or dismiss shop assistants and apprentices), the concerns of merchants and civilians were gradually dispelled by the facts, and they could operate their businesses with peace of mind. In mid-August, the merchant and civilian group in Huanghua Street, Nanguan, automatically expanded into a street business association, appropriately mediating 106 cases involving issues such as rent and shop assistant wages. The merchants' and civilians' understanding of the government's policy of developing industry and commerce greatly improved, resulting in the number of stores on that street increasing from 80 to 145 in half a month. Merchants and civilians in other streets also separately established street business associations from the bottom up, and on September 30, they held a meeting to formally establish the Jincheng County Business Association. The meeting was attended by more than 420 managers and shopkeepers from public and private businesses, who democratically elected Liu Erhu, Niu Xianglin, and 18 others as committee members. Liu and Niu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and they are both managers of private stores. At the meeting, the association's constitution was unanimously adopted. The constitution specifically stipulates that the purpose and tasks of the Jincheng Business Association are: to protect the interests of merchants and civilians and meet the needs of the people; to benefit oneself and others and regulate supply and demand; to develop industry and commerce, promote the sale of local products, and promote a prosperous market; to cooperate with relevant organizations to mediate various disputes between merchants and civilians, merchants and farmers, and capitalists and shopkeepers, shop assistants and owners. It also stipulates that the association will consult with the shop assistant union to ensure that shops protect the occupational freedom of shop assistants and apprentices, and prevent unjustified dismissal and mistreatment, to promote labor-capital cooperation; shop assistants and apprentices have the time and opportunity to study politics, culture, and business.
