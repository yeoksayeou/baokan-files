　　Handan Mass Movement Gains Experience
　　Fifty Villages Achieve "Land to the Tiller"
　　[News from Weixian by our newspaper] Fifty villages in Handan have initially achieved "land to the tiller." The following are some experiences: First, hold a meeting of village cadres to deeply understand the situation, then hold a mass meeting to explain policies and support the masses. Then conduct individual talks to discover victims of hardship, help them dig up the roots of poverty, and shift from small-group complaints to large-scale complaints. In this way, not only do poor peasants have energy, but middle peasants also sympathize, and they unite to reason with and settle accounts with local tyrants and landlords. Second, after the base villages are mobilized, training classes for activists are held in communities or groups to impart the policies to the masses, let them discuss and get their ideas through and return to the villages to "ignite the fire." Third, for village cadres who are corrupt or leak information, persuade and educate them in the movement, let them reflect on what good things they have done for the masses and how much wine they have drunk with the landlords. After reflection, many village cadres confessed their mistakes to the masses, and the masses also treated them leniently. After democratic supervision and transformation, the village cadres have also changed their work style and are working actively.

　　邯郸群运取得经验
    五十村实现耕者有其田
    【本报威县讯】邯郸五十村初步达到“耕者有其田”。有以下几点经验：一、先召开村干部会深入了解情况，再召开群众大会讲政策，给群众撑腰。然后进行个别谈话发现苦主，帮助挖穷根，由小组诉苦转向大会诉苦，这样不但贫农有劲，中农也同情，联合起来向恶霸地主说理清算。二、基点村动起来后，便以小区或小组召开积极分子训练班，把政策交给群众，让他们讨论，打通思想回村“点火”。三、对贪污走风的村干部，在运动中说服教育他，让他反省给群众办了哪些好事，又喝过地主多少酒？经过反省，好多村干向群众坦白认错，群众对他们也宽大处理，经过民主监督改造后的村干部也都转变了作风，积极的干起来了。
