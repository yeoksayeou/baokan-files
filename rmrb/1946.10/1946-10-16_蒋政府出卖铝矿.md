Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Following the sale of aluminum mines in the Northeast and Taiwan, the Nationalist government is now planning to sell the Shandong Aluminum Company, which is currently being restored. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on September 19, the Resources Committee has decided to "cooperate" with the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), and the United States will send experts to inspect the light metal factories left by the Japanese in Shandong and Taiwan. It is reported that the Shandong Aluminum Company was reorganized by the Resources Committee by merging the Zhangdian Bauxite Company and the Light Metal Factory. The total value of the Light Metal Factory is US$12 million (approximately 400 million legal tender), with an annual output of 20,000 tons of pure aluminum. The output is not only the first in the Far East, but also the highest in Europe, second only to Alcoa's annual output of 30,000 tons. Aluminum can not only be used to manufacture general daily utensils, but also is an important raw material for manufacturing airplanes.

　　蒋政府出卖铝矿
    【新华社延安十日电】国民党当局继出卖东北及台湾之铝矿厂后，近又拟出卖正在恢复中的山东铝业公司。据九月十九日天津大公报载：资源委员会已决定与美国铝业公司“合作”，美即将派专家视察山东及台湾两地日人遗留之轻金属工厂。据称：山东铝业公司系由资委会将张店矾土公司及轻金属厂合并改组而成，轻金属厂总值为一千二百万美金（约合法币四百多万万元），年产纯铝二万吨，产量不仅为远东首位，亦冠全欧，仅次于美铝业公司年产三万吨之数。按铝之功用不仅可制造日常一般器皿，且为制造飞机之重要原料。
