　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. The Yan'an community's mass meeting in response to the "American Troops Out of China" movement sent the following telegram to the American Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Policy in the Far East:

　　Your committee's launched "Withdraw from China Movement Week," opposing the American government's current policy of interfering in China's internal affairs, has given great encouragement to the Chinese people who are striving for independence, peace, and democracy. It is hoped that your committee and the American people will continue to work hard to restore President Roosevelt's policy of international cooperation, so that the Chinese and American people can work together towards a new world of peace, democracy, and stability.
