Taiyue Holds Movement Week Responding to the Movement for US Troops to Withdraw from China
Let the Masses Understand the Crimes of Chiang and the US and Deeply Mobilize Various Rescue Appeals
[Our Newspaper Yangcheng Twentieth Dispatch] Representatives from all circles in Taiyue recently gathered to launch a "US Troops Withdraw from China" Movement Week in response to the "Demand for US Troops to Withdraw from China" movement initiated by all circles in Shanghai. The meeting was initiated by Cui Douchen, Gao Yanliu, Sun Dingguo, Shi Zhenming, Ye Mingzhu, Liu Yupu, Wei Heng, and others. The first meeting was held at 4:00 PM on the 14th in the Literary Association Conference Hall. Gao Yanliu, a veteran educator from Henan and representative of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association in the Taiyue area, first proposed: In order to make the masses more deeply aware of the true face of the US-Chiang reactionaries, it is necessary for our region to launch this movement. Cui Douchen, a senior figure in the Jinan education circles and director of the Administrative Office of Education, firmly said: Because the American reactionaries are stubbornly clinging to the "stinking meat" of assisting Chiang in the civil war, in addition to focusing on propaganda and appeals, our movement should become a long-term movement. Therefore, we should oppose the US aggression against China policy through various practical actions such as resisting American goods. After everyone finished speaking, the following proposals were discussed and approved: (1) Establish the Taiyue Area Committee for Responding to the "US Troops Withdraw from China" Movement, with the office located in the office of the参议会 [Consultative Council]. (2) In order to universally and deeply promote the movement, establish a working committee, and elect Cui Douchen and Jiang Heng as the director and deputy director, and Gao Yanliu, Sun Dingguo, and Shi Yizhi as members. (3) Select special personnel to draft appeals and propaganda outlines. (4) Determine the specific schedule for Movement Week as follows: Starting from the 21st of this month, the first day will be middle school and higher primary school student activity day, the 22nd will be primary school student activity day, the third, fourth, and fifth days will be farmer and merchant activity days, the sixth day will be activity day for government agencies, organizations, troops, and public factories, and the seventh day will be a mass rally. Other sub-districts, counties, and districts can hold their own events based on specific circumstances.
[Our Newspaper Yangcheng Twentieth Dispatch] The Taiyue Area Federation of Trade Unions, Farmers' Associations, Youth Leagues, and Women's Federations, the Taiyue Area Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Taiyue Area Martial Arts Committee General Association, in response to the "Demand for US Troops to Withdraw from China Movement," have issued a joint notice to deploy the following work: First, through various organizational systems or mutual aid groups, discuss or hold forums with the masses on the reactionary behavior of the US-Chiang clique in attacking the Chinese people, in order to truly recognize the true face of US imperialism's aggression against China and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland. Overcome the idea of peaceful quick victory. Second, actively participate in organizing and leading the masses to respond to and promote this movement, create various lively and popular forms, carry out widespread and in-depth propaganda, and combine it with war participation work to further promote the movement of the masses to participate in the war to protect their homes. Third, each theater troupe and yangko team should compile various small scripts, yangko dances,快板 [clapper talks], and songs to conduct propaganda in conjunction with the movement. Winter schools should also take this as one of the regular educational content. Fourth, the militia self-defense forces can combine this movement with in-depth martial arts education, review the people's self-defense forces, and strengthen the people's belief in victory.
[Our Newspaper Yangcheng Twentieth Dispatch] Representatives from all circles in Taiyue, responding to the "US Troops Withdraw from China" movement, called on compatriots and patriots throughout the region to work with democratic people across the country to take practical action. First, carry out extensive propaganda and mobilization, and use all opportunities and all forms (large meetings, small meetings, forums, temple fairs, etc.) to conduct widespread and in-depth propaganda among the masses about the imperialist behavior of the United States in destroying China, and publicize Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crimes of betraying the motherland. Second, combine this movement with supporting the frontline work, carry out stubborn resistance and guerrilla warfare, set off a nationwide resistance upsurge, and strive for greater victory in the patriotic self-defense war.
