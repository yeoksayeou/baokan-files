Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Paris dispatch: After completing the vote on the Italian peace treaty late on the 9th, the Peace Conference plenary session began debating the issue of the Romanian peace treaty on the morning of the 10th. The debate revolved around the Danube River issue and lasted all day. Soviet delegation leader Molotov spoke last before the adjournment in the afternoon, refuting the speeches of US Senator Vandenberg and British Foreign Secretary Bevin who spoke before him. Both Vandenberg and Bevin demanded that Balkan countries trade and that the Danube be under international joint control. Molotov said: If the principle of equal opportunity is to be applied, then it should be applied to all issues. Why can't it be applied to other waterways of interest to many countries? The Danube is not the only international waterway. There are other international waterways, as well as sea routes connecting major oceans with extreme international importance, such as the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. If you are enthusiastic about upholding the principle of equal opportunity, then don't be inconsistent and should deal with the problem fairly and honestly. Molotov rebuked Vandenberg for mentioning the 1856 Danube International Agreement. He directly faced Mr. Van and reminded the American senator that in 1856, the United States still had slavery. Times have changed greatly since then. Molotov also condemned Britain for maintaining its imperialist policies and attempting to impose this policy on the Balkan countries. He condemned Bevin's statement that Britain would not abandon 19th-century imperialism, saying that Britain has not abandoned imperialism in the Far East. After Molotov's speech, the plenary session adjourned, at 6:15 pm. Before that, Yugoslav Premier Kardelj had also criticized Vandenberg's speech on the Danube River. Vandenberg was the first speaker at the plenary session on the 10th. Only a few representatives were present when he began his speech, and there was an atmosphere of fatigue in the conference hall. The plenary session on the 10th was convened six hours after the fourteen-and-a-half-hour meeting on the 9th. There were three meetings throughout the day, and the vote on the Romanian peace treaty began at 9 pm until the early morning of the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Paris dispatch: At the Peace Conference plenary session on the afternoon of the 8th, British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech and called on the countries of the Peace Conference to unite as the foundation for peace. Bevin fundamentally denied trying to establish an Anglo-American bloc. He said: For ten weeks, representatives have attacked each other from time to time, but our achievements cannot be judged based on such attacks, because the results of the Peace Conference can only be judged based on the final peace treaty; although the progress of the meeting has been extremely slow, we do not regret it. We never want a confrontation between blocs. Our spirit of unity has been the foundation of victory and must also be the foundation of peace. Yugoslav Premier Kardelj accused on the night of the 8th that "Britain and the United States lack sincerity in promoting peace and are attempting to engage in imperialist international politics, deliberately splitting the Peace Conference and forcing a minority of countries to submit to their will." He said that the draft Italian peace treaty deprives Yugoslavia of its legitimate rights, and the South will never sign it. Mr. Cardell's speech was the most intense in the ten weeks of the Peace Conference. French Foreign Minister Bidault called on Yugoslavia to accept the French compromise proposal on the Trieste issue, which had been passed by the Italian Political Territory Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Paris dispatch: The Peace Conference plenary session reconvened seven hours after the vote on the Romanian peace treaty to begin discussing the Bulgarian peace treaty. The number of attending representatives has been decreasing daily, with only forty-two people present. US Secretary of State Byrnes replaced Molotov as chairman. The first speaker was Polish representative Wierblowski, who said: Some people are trying to discriminate against Bulgaria, which has fewer faults in the German and Italian camps. Some people do not like to see the Bulgarian people establish a democratic regime. Bulgaria is forced to pay excessive reparations to Greece, because Bulgaria has never waged war against Greece. When Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris delivered a speech, he demanded that a piece of Bulgarian territory on the Bulgarian-Greek border be ceded to Greece. British representative Alexander supported the Greek request, and US representative Caffery declared that if Greece were threatened, it would be provided with assistance. Soviet representative Vyshinsky condemned Greece for adopting a hostile attitude towards Yugoslavia and democratic Bulgaria, and condemned Britain and the United States for attempting to directly intervene to prevent the development of young Bulgarian democracy. The Yugoslav representative made two major demands in his speech, namely, that British troops withdraw from Greece and the US Navy leave the Mediterranean, and not interfere in the internal affairs of the Balkan countries. On the evening of the 11th, the plenary session voted on the Bulgarian peace treaty item by item. When the Bulgarian border was voted on, nine countries including the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, Norway, the United States, Ukraine, and Belarus voted in favor of the original proposal, that is, the Greek-Bulgarian border should remain unchanged according to the January 1, 1941 border, but it was not passed because twelve countries including Britain abstained. The Greek request for Bulgarian territory was passed by eleven votes to six.

　　和会全会展开激烈争辩
    苏联反对共管多脑河
    南总理控诉美英无促进和平诚意
    【新华社延安十一日电】巴黎讯：和会全会于九日深夜完成对意和约的表决后，十日上午即开始辩论对罗和约问题。辩论围绕着多脑河问题，持续了一整天。苏代表团长莫洛托夫于下午休会前最后一个发言，他反驳了在他之前的美参议员范登堡及英外相贝文发言，范、贝二人俱要求巴尔干各国贸易，多脑河应国际共管。莫洛托夫说：假如要应用机会均等原则的话，那末就应用在一切问题上，为什么不能应用于许多国家利益相关的其他水道上呢？多脑河并非唯一的国际水道，此外还有其他国际水道，并且是海路及连结各大洋的具有极端国际重要性的水道，例如巴拿马运河及苏伊士运河。假如热心拥护机会均等原则的话，那末就不要前后矛盾，应该公平老实的处理问题。莫洛托夫斥责范登堡提及一八五六年的多脑河国际协定，他直接面对着范氏，提醒这位美国参议员说：一八五六年时，美国还有奴隶制度呢，自那时以来，时代已经大大改变了。莫洛托夫又谴责英国保持帝国主义政策，并企图将这一政策施之于巴尔干诸国，他斥责贝文关于英国不放弃十九世纪之帝国主义的声明，他说：英国并未放弃在远东的帝国主义。莫洛托夫讲话后，全会即休会，时为下午六时十五分。在此之前，南总理卡德尔亦曾斥责范登堡关于多脑河之发言。范登堡是十日全会中第一个发言人，他开始演讲时，只有少数代表到会，会议厅中有一种疲倦的气氛。十日的全会是在九日的十四小时半的会议之后六小时召开的，整天共开会三次，晚间从九时起表决对罗和约，直至十一日清晨为止。
    【新华社延安十日电】巴黎讯：八日下午和会全会上，英外相贝文演说，并呼吁和会各国使团结成为和平的基础。贝文根本否认试图建立英美集团，他说：十周以来，各代表时有互相攻击之事，但不能根据此种攻击来评判我们的成就，因只有根据最后之和约可以评判和会之结果；会议之进展虽极迟慢，但我们并不引以为憾，我们绝不愿有集团与集团之对抗，我们之精神一致曾为胜利之基础，亦须为和平之基础。南斯拉夫总理卡德尔于八日夜控诉称：“英美无促进和平之诚意，而企图从事帝国主义之国际政治，故意分裂和会而强制少数国家服从其意志。”他说：意大利和约草案剥夺南斯拉夫正当之权利，南国决不签字。卡氏之演讲为和会十周以来最激烈之言辞。法外长比道尔则呼吁南斯拉夫接受法国所提出之关于的里雅斯特问题之折衷提案，此案已为意大利政治领土委员会所通过。
    【新华社延安十二日电】巴黎讯：和会全会于表决对罗和约后七小时再开，开始讨论保加利亚和约，出席代表已日形减少，仅有四十二人。由美国务卿贝纳斯代替莫洛托夫轮任主席，首先发言者为波兰代表魏勃洛夫斯基，他说：有人企图歧视在德意营垒中罪过较少的保加利亚，有人不喜欢见到保国人民建立民主政权，保国被迫偿付希腊之赔款，实已过分，因保国从未对希作战。希总理曹德利斯于演说时，要求将保希边境的一块保国领土割给希腊。英代表亚历山大支持希方要求，美代表卡福莱声言，如希腊受威胁时，将予以援助。苏代表维辛斯基谴责希腊对南斯拉夫与民主的保加利亚采取敌视态度，并斥责英美企图直接干涉以阻止年轻的保加利亚民主主义的发展。南斯拉夫代表于发言中提出两大要求，即英军撤离希腊，美海军离开地中海，不要干涉巴尔干各国内政。十一日晚间，全会逐条表决对保和约，当表决保国边界时，苏、南、捷、波、法、挪、美、乌克兰及白俄罗斯等九国赞成原案，即按一九四一年一月一日边界，确定希、保边界不变，但因英国等十二个弃权，故未通过。而关于希腊的提向保国领土的要求，竟以十一票对六票通过。
