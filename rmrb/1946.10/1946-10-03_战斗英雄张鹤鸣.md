　　Combat Hero Zhang Heming
    Ding Man
    Zhang Heming was a soldier of the 30th Army of the Chiang army who was liberated in the Ping-Han Campaign last year. After he joined the 9th Regiment, 1st Battalion, 2nd Company of the People's Army, he served as the deputy squad leader of the 3rd Squad. His company often supplemented some new brothers who had laid down their arms. He usually told them: "Chiang Kai-shek sold China to the United States. He is willing to be a son emperor. I don't want to be a son soldier, so I laid down my arms and came to the Eighth Route Army. In the Chiang army, the officers often said that if the Eighth Route Army caught you, they would either cut off your head or bury you alive. But since I came to the Eighth Route Army, I have never seen a prisoner who was not treated with preferential treatment. Here, you are neither beaten nor scolded. Officers and soldiers are the same. Compared to the Chiang army, where you were slapped every two days and kicked every three days, and the officers bullied the soldiers, life is really extremely happy." On the battlefield, he also often shouted slogans based on his personal experience of free life,争取争取争取争取不少的士兵. During the Lanfeng battle, 400 Chiang soldiers laid down their arms and came to their regiment and company. None of the new brothers who came to their company were in low spirits or deserted. Therefore, their Second Company has twice won the glorious title of "Model for Consolidating and Educating New Brothers," and this glorious title is inseparable from Zhang Heming. Zhang Heming was very brave and resourceful on the battlefield, and each battle resulted in very few casualties for his company. In the Dayang Lake battle, he happily accepted the task of serving as the grenade throwing squad leader. Before the battle began, Zhang Heming said to his three grenade throwing team members, Long Haizhang, Xu Yuanshui, and Li Haicheng (brothers liberated in the Lanfeng battle): "Tonight, we will eliminate the enemy. Grenades are our only weapon. The machine gun shooters proposed to guarantee continuous firing on the battlefield. We propose to guarantee continuous grenade throwing on the battlefield. We must destroy the enemy's fortifications and eliminate the enemies who refuse to surrender in the bunkers." At 3 o'clock, the sun set, the surroundings were dark, only the fireworks of Dayang Lake soared into the sky. Each person carrying fifteen grenades, followed his team towards the fire. The team was only thirty meters away from Dayang Lake. From the fire, the enemy's constructed barricades could be clearly seen. Company Commander He Yugang discovered that several trees in front of the team had been cut down by the enemy. He judged that this place was the enemy's firepower blockade point. He directed the team to move to the flanks and construct fortifications, while designating Zhang Heming to scout the situation. Zhang Heming returned and reported to Company Commander He: "There are enemies ahead, and the hidden bunker is a machine gun position." Several minutes later, sporadic machine gun fire came from there, completely confirming his words. Zhang Heming, with agile movements, moved to the left front of the troops to reconnoiter, and quickly returned to report to the company commander: "In front is the enemy's first line of single-person bunkers. There are no enemies inside the fortifications." The enemies, who had not rested day and night, were dozing off in the bunkers at night. At this time, only the sound of the wind and the snoring coming from the enemy's fortifications could be heard. Company Commander He asked Zhang Heming to continue reconnaissance. Zhang Heming led grenade throwing team member Long Haizhang to quietly crawl over. He left Long Haizhang in a single-person bunker, and he continued to reconnoiter forward, suddenly discovering an enemy hidden bunker with two heavy machine guns and one light machine gun protruding from the gunholes. Zhang Heming calmly retreated to the single-person bunker, gave Long Haizhang a designated target, and said: "In front is the enemy's hidden bunker. If the enemy discovers us, you will first eliminate this hidden bunker." Zhang Heming quickly went to report to Company Commander He. At twelve o'clock at night, the general attack was about to begin. Zhang Heming led the grenade throwing team to break a hole in the barricades, opening a way forward for the assault队员s behind. Zhang Heming and his team members were hidden beside the enemy's sandbag fortifications, monitoring the enemy's heavy machine gun position in front. Because it was too close to the enemy, they could not use verbal commands. He stipulated a command signal: "When I raise my hand, everyone throws grenades together. When I lower my hand, everyone lies down." At half past twelve, the charge began. The grenades of Zhang Heming's grenade throwing team struck the hidden bunker, knocking down one enemy. The rest pulled the machine guns and ran away. The grenade throwing team occupied the enemy's hidden bunker. The ladder架梯组 set up ladders. Zhang Heming took the lead. The enemy retreated to two courtyards. His grenades were used up. He said to his team members: "Everyone should save one or two grenades to prevent the enemy from counterattacking." He ran back and asked Company Commander He for eight more grenades, and reported to the company commander: "The enemy in the hidden bunker has been eliminated. Zhao Guiyu, Wu Lianzhong, and Wu Jinrong have already set up the ladders. The assault company should hurry up." The enemies on the left and right fronts of the assault team began to fire wildly, but the assault troops had already followed the ladder架梯组 from the gaps in the enemy's firepower and attacked, occupying the enemy's second courtyard. Therefore, the assault team suffered no casualties at all. Zhang Heming went up for the second time. At this time, the assault team and the sappers had all caught up. The explosions of the grenade throwing team's grenades and the bullets of the assault team directly drove the enemy to the seventh courtyard. As Zhang Heming rushed forward to capture a prisoner, an enemy on the side threw a grenade, and Zhang Heming, Li Haicheng, and Xu Yuanshui were all wounded. But Zhang Heming and Long Haizhang persisted until the enemy at Dayang Lake was eliminated. Zhang Heming and his grenade throwing team successfully completed their task. All the commanders and fighters of the 9th Regiment praised Zhang Heming's heroic resourcefulness and recognized him as the number one combat hero since the Longhai Campaign.

　　战斗英雄张鹤鸣
    丁曼
    张鹤鸣是去年平汉战役被解放的蒋军三十军的战士，他到人民军队伍里九团一营二连后，充任了三班副班长，他连经常补充一些放下武器的新弟兄，他平时好向他们讲：“蒋介石把中国卖给美国，他愿当儿皇帝，我不愿当儿兵，所以就放下武器到八路军来。在蒋军时，军官们常说叫八路军抓住，不是割头、就是活埋，但从我到八路军后，没有见过一个俘虏不受优待。在这里一不挨打、二不挨骂，官和兵是一样，比起在蒋军时，两天挨耳光、三天挨脚踢，是官都欺侮兵的生活，实在痛快极了。”在战场上他也常以亲身体验过的自由生活喊话，争取了不少的士兵。兰封战斗时，就有四百名蒋军放下武器到他们团连里来。历次到他们连里的新弟兄，也没有一个情绪不高或开小差的。所以他们二连在两次获得了“巩固教育新弟兄的模范”的光荣称号，这个光荣称号是与张鹤鸣分不开的。在战场上张鹤鸣十分英勇、机智，每次战斗都使本连很少伤亡。大杨湖战斗他愉快的接受了任务，担任投弹班长。战斗没有开始前，张鹤鸣向他三个投弹组员龙海章、徐元水、李海成（兰封战斗被解放的弟兄）说：“今晚消灭敌人，手榴弹是我们唯一的武器，人家机枪射击手提出到战场上保证使机关枪打连，我们提出到战场上手榴弹也要打连。我们要摧毁敌人的工事，把不缴枪的敌人消灭在地堡里。三号，夕阳西下，四周漆黑，唯有大杨湖烟火冲天，每人带着十五个手榴弹，随着他的队伍向火光前进，队伍距大杨湖仅有三十米达远，从火光中可以清楚的看到敌人构筑的鹿砦，何渔岗连长发现队伍前面的几棵树被敌人砍掉了，他判断这地方是敌人的火力封锁点，他一面调集队伍向侧翼移动，构筑工事，一面指定张鹤鸣前去侦察情况，张鹤鸣回来报告何连长说：“前面有敌人，暗堡是机枪阵地。”数分钟后敌人从那里射击出稀疏的机枪声，完全证实了他的话。张鹤鸣又以敏捷的动作，运动到部队的左前方去侦察，又迅速回来报告连长说：“前面是敌人构筑的第一线单人掩体，工事里面并没有敌人。”日夜不得休息的敌人，晚间在地堡里瞌睡了，这时只听到风声和敌人工事里传出来的鼾声，何连长叫张鹤鸣继续向前侦察，张鹤鸣带投弹组员龙海章静悄悄的爬过去，他把龙海章留在单人掩体中，自己再向前侦察，突然发现了敌人的一个暗堡，两挺重机枪、一挺轻机枪，从枪眼里突出头来。张鹤鸣沉着的退到单入掩体里，给龙海章指定好目标说：“前面是敌人的暗堡，敌人如果发觉了我们，你就首先消灭敌人这个暗堡”。张鹤鸣又迅速去报告何连长。夜十二时，总攻击快开始了，张鹤鸣带领着投弹组把鹿砦折了一个洞，给后面的突击队员们开辟一条前进的路，张鹤鸣和他的组员荫蔽在敌人的沙包工事旁，监视着前面的敌人重机枪阵地。因为距敌人太近，不能用语言指挥，他便规定指挥记号说我的手一举，大家一齐投弹。手一放，大家就卧倒。”十二时半冲锋开始了，张鹤鸣投弹组的手榴弹向暗堡打去，倒了一个敌人，其余的拉着机关枪就跑，投弹组占领了敌人的暗堡，架梯组竖起梯子，张鹤鸣快步当先，敌人退出两处院子，他的手榴弹打完了，他向组员说：“大家的手榴弹要留下一两颗，防备敌人反攻”，他跑回来又向何连长要了八颗手榴弹，报告连长说：“暗堡的敌人被消灭了，赵贵雨、吴连中、吴金荣已经立起了梯子，突击连应当赶快上。”突击队左右前方的敌人发疯的扫射起来，然而突击部队已经随着梯子组从敌人火力间隙中攻上去，占领了敌人的第二道院子，因此突击队丝毫没有伤亡。张鹤鸣第二次上去，这时候突击队、工兵都赶上去了。投弹组的手榴弹的爆炸和突击队的子弹，直驱逐敌人到第七层院子。当着张鹤鸣冲去正抓一个俘虏，不料侧面的敌人投过来一颗手榴弹，张鹤鸣、李海成、徐元水三人都挂了彩。但是张鹤鸣和龙海章一直坚持到消灭了大杨湖的敌人，张鹤鸣和他的投弹组完满的完成了他们的任务，九团的全体指战员个个称赞张鹤鸣的英雄机智，公认是陇海战役以来的第一名战斗英雄。
