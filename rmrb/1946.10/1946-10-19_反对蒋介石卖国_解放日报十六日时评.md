　　Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Treason
　　*Liberation Daily* Sixteenth Commentary

　　Today's paper reprints a news item from the American magazine *World Report*: "China (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang) has allowed American warships to be repaired in Chinese coastal docks for thirty years in order to obtain the right to purchase more than 800 million yuan of surplus American military supplies." This is another secret treasonous agreement that Chiang Kai-shek has concluded with the United States. According to this, the United States will have free access to and use, and will in fact occupy, all of our seaports. This alone is enough to condemn Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes!

　　But in this treasonous transaction, the Chinese sovereignty that Chiang Kai-shek has auctioned off is far more than this. After the Surplus Property Sales Agreement was concluded on August 31, the Chiang Kai-shek government signed a contract with Chennault of the US side, authorizing Chennault to organize an airlift team to fly throughout China. Subsequently, on September 2, the Chiang Kai-shek government signed an aircraft landing agreement between Shanghai and Manila with the Philippine government, which is controlled by the United States; thus, China's airspace rights were gradually sold off by Chiang Kai-shek. On September 19, at the suggestion of the US representative, the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee, held in Shanghai, passed the "Transporting UNRRA Supplies to Four Yangtze Ports (Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou)" proposal; during the same period, the Chiang government also allowed American ships to sail from Okinawa to and dock at the key ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung in Taiwan. Thus, the rights of navigation on inland rivers and along the coast were also sold out by Chiang Kai-shek. According to the *Shanghai Ta Kung Pao* on September 12, the "cooperation" plan for US investment in the Yuehan Railway has been embodied in the total amount of US$61 million in war funds, with the US side accounting for two-thirds. Thus, the sovereignty of this north-south transportation lifeline is no longer ours. According to the *Shanghai Shang Bao* on September 7, the Taiwan Provincial Gazette declared: "Taiwan Province welcomes investment from the United States, Britain, and the United Nations in various enterprises, especially in agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, and transportation, and welcomes direct investment from foreign businesses." According to a Central News Agency dispatch on September 6, representatives of the US-China Industrial and Commercial Advancement Association will soon come to China "to fly to Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Xichang, and other places to conduct preliminary investigations before investing in various construction projects in the Southwest." Thus, the sovereignty of our country's various economic resources is about to be put into the pockets of US imperialism.

　　Look! In this short month, Chiang Kai-shek has auctioned off so much of our national sovereignty, creating a new record for treasonous crimes in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. In order to be a docile son and emperor of US imperialism and to obtain surplus supplies to carry out civil war and massacre the people, Chiang Kai-shek is so brazenly selling out the country. On the other hand, compatriots across the country can see very clearly from this that the reason why US imperialism wants to sell more than 800 million yuan of supplies to Chiang Kai-shek and support Chiang Kai-shek to continue and expand the civil war is to make all of our compatriots slaves of US imperialism; and Chiang Kai-shek is just a running dog of US imperialism's attempt to destroy China. However, the people of our country are determined not to be slaves, and we are determined to oppose all the treasonous agreements signed by Chiang Kai-shek, and we are determined to carry out our nation's patriotic struggle to the final victory!

### 反对蒋介石卖国  解放日报十六日时评

　　反对蒋介石卖国
    解放日报十六日时评
    今日本报转载美国杂志“世界报导”消息：“中国（指蒋介石国民党）为了获得购买八亿余元美军剩余物资的权利，已允许美国军舰在三十年内可在中国沿海船坞修理。”这是蒋介石对美国订立的又一秘密卖国协定。依此，美国便得自由出入使用并实际上是占领了我国的一切海港。只此一宗，蒋介石的卖国罪恶已不容诛！
    可是在这项卖国交易中，蒋介石所拍卖的中国主权却远不止此。八月三十一日让售物资条约成立，蒋介石政府即与美方陈纳德订立合同，授权陈纳德组织空运队，在中国各地飞行。随着，九月二日蒋介石政府又与美国控制下的菲律滨政府签订上海马尼拉间的飞机降落协定；于是，中国领空权被蒋介石陆续出卖干净了。九月十九日，在美代表的提议下，在沪举行的联总远东区委员会通过了“载运联总物资至长江四口岸（南京、芜湖、九江、汉口）”案；同时期中，蒋政府并已准许美国轮船自琉球驶入及停泊于我台湾之基隆及高雄两要港。于是，内河及沿海航行权又被蒋介石出卖完了。据九月十二日沪大公报载：美方投资粤汉铁路之“合作”计划，已具体化在六千一百万美金的战资总额中，美方占三分之二。于是，这一横贯南北的交通命脉之主权又非复我有。据九月七日沪商报载：台省公报宣称：“台省之各种企业，欢迎美英及联合国方面之投资，尤其农林工矿及交通方面，欢迎外商之直接投资。”又据中央社九月六日讯：美方“中美工商协进会”代表即将来华，“飞重庆、成都、昆明、西昌等地，作投资西南各项建设前之初步考察”。于是，我国的各种经济资源的主权，眼看着又将放到美帝国主义的口袋里去了。
    看吧！在这短短一个月内，蒋介石把我们国家的主权陆陆续续地拍卖得如此之多，造成了中外古今卖国罪行的新纪录。蒋介石为了要当美帝国主义的顺从的儿皇帝，获得剩余物资来进行内战，屠杀人民，才这样放肆地卖国。另一方面，全国同胞从这里看得很清楚，美帝国主义所以要让售八亿余元物资给蒋介石，支持蒋介石继续与扩大内战，就是要我们全国同胞都做美帝国主义的亡国奴；而蒋介石不过是美帝国主义企图灭亡中国的走狗而已。但是，我们全国人民是誓死也不愿做亡国奴的，我们誓死反对蒋介石签订的一切卖国协定，誓死把我们全民族的爱国主义的斗争一直进行到最后胜利！
