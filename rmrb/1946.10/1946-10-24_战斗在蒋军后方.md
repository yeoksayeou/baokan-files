　　Fighting Behind Enemy Lines in Chiang's Army
    Shi Ming
    American-Equipped Guerrilla Force
    In the area between Nantong and Rugao, from Baibu to Linzi, guerrilla forces, forged and grown during the three months of the self-defense war, are everywhere along the sides of this mere twelve-mile stretch of highway. Among them, the Guo Haibo Guerrilla Force, praised by the people as "celestial soldiers," awarded the title of "Guerrilla Direction" by higher authorities, and fearfully referred to by Chiang's army as "Guo Haibo's gang" (meaning tenacious and good at fighting), has gone through hundreds of battles, large and small, exchanging hand grenades and broken rifles for the American-equipped weapons of Chiang's army, seizing two rocket launchers, fourteen light machine guns, fifteen Thompson submachine guns, sixteen carbines, fifteen rifles, five "buck" guns, and five pistols. In ×× Township, Taixing County, the militia guerrilla force of a single township captured eight machine guns, two Thompson submachine guns, three select-fire weapons, over a hundred rifles, and more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition. When the reporter talked to the militia guerrilla force about their equipment, they all smiled and said, "We are American-equipped troops now!"
  Mobile Warfare and Search Warfare
    When the main force fights large-scale mobile warfare, to completely annihilate the enemy, the people's guerrilla force actively conducts "small-scale mobile warfare" and search warfare on the mobile battlefield. In the annihilation battle in the southern suburbs of Rugao, the militia of ×× Township searched and captured 1,120 fleeing Chiang soldiers. Zhou Zhenming, a militia hero from ×× Township, participated in the militia's "war participation commando team," and before the battle in front was even over, he charged down alone with a knife, capturing twenty prisoners alive and seizing two long guns and three short guns. In the Dingyan campaign, when a remnant of Chiang's army, a force of over twenty men, broke through and fled, they were immediately surrounded by the Guo Haibo Guerrilla Force, forcing the Chiang soldiers to shout "Surrender weapons, not lives," and put down all their American weapons.
  Cutting off the Enemy's "Blood Vessels"
    When Chiang's army ventures deep, the strongholds in the rear of Chiang's army are empty, and the militia guerrilla force fights intensely. They have uprooted the towns of Xiao Hai, Da Xiao Piegang in Nantong, and Gushan, Baimuqiao in Jingjiang, actively operating on Chiang's army's transportation lines, cutting off the enemy's "blood vessels."
    The Tong-Ru line—this connects Nantong City, Chiang's army's "bridgehead fortress," with the forward strategic point of Rugao City. On this transportation line, the militia guerrilla force widely展开 guerilla warfare, sparrow warfare, and sabotage warfare. On July 31st, they cooperated with the local military corps, ambushing south of Dingyan, destroying seven Chiang army vehicles in one fell swoop, and seizing over one million rounds of artillery shells and bullets, all the supplies Chiang's army was transporting to the two divisions in Rugao ended up here. In another major sabotage campaign, over thirty miles of highway were destroyed, resembling a dead snake covered in wounds. Chiang's army switched to telephone communication, but five miles of telephone line from Baibu to Linzi were harvested by the militia. Chiang's army's brand-new yellow-skinned telephone wire was laid hidden in the fields, but on that very night, it was all harvested clean by the guerrilla force. From then on, Chiang's army no longer used yellow-skinned wire, switching to using old wire laid in the fields, but it was still destroyed by the guerrilla force. Since then, Chiang's army has lost confidence in setting up telephones and can only use small armed groups for communication. However, the militia guerrilla force is conducting harassment and blocking, fighting sparrow warfare from all directions… In this way, Chiang's army has no way to communicate or supply itself.
    "Wherever Chiang's army goes, guerrilla warfare is launched there!" has become the action slogan of the militia guerrilla force here. (Xinhua News Agency)
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st dispatch] The militia guerrilla forces of Rugao, Taixian, Taixing, Jingjiang, and Zishi (new county) counties in the First Division of Suwan's Chiang-controlled area have achieved brilliant results in the two and a half months (ending in September) of the self-defense war to protect their fields and homes. A total of 1,104 battles, large and small, have been fought, capturing 1,854 Chiang army officers and soldiers, and killing 317 Chiang soldiers; seizing ten cannons of various types, 98 machine guns of various types, 63 guns such as "Thompson," "Carbine," and "Canadian," more than 910 rifles, 105 short guns, and 200,000 rounds of ammunition. Among them, Rugao County has the best results in the entire division, with 866 Chiang soldiers captured, including 59 light, heavy, and anti-aircraft machine guns and 51 American-style rifles. Taixian County has the most frequent operations, reaching more than 510 times, and captured alive Wang Zhendong, the head of the "Returning Home Corps" in the Baimi area, and killed Song Bo, the battalion commander of Chiang's "Self-Defense Force."

　　战斗在蒋军后方
    史明
    美械化的游击队
    在南通如皋间，从白蒲到林梓，通一段仅仅十二里长的公路两侧，在三个月的自卫战争中锻炼生长起来的游击队，到处皆是。其中一支被人民誉为“神仙”，被上级奖为“游击队方向”，被蒋军恐怖地称为“郭海波儿”（意叫顽强善战）的郭海波游击队，他们经过了百数十次的大小战斗，用手榴弹和破步枪换取了蒋军的美械装备，缴获火箭炮二个，轻机枪十四挺，汤姆式十五挺，卡宾枪十六支，步枪十五支，卜壳枪五支，手枪五支。泰兴县××乡一个乡的民兵游击队就缴到八挺机枪，二挺汤姆，三支快慢机，百余支步枪和三万多发子弹。记者和民兵游击队谈起装备的事，他们都笑着说：“我们是美械化的部队了！”
  运动战和搜索战
    当主力打大运动战，要彻底歼灭敌人的时候，人民游击队就在运动战场上活跃的进行“小运动战”和搜索战。在如皋南郊歼灭战中，××乡民兵搜俘逃散蒋军一千一百二十名。××乡民兵英雄周振明参加民兵“参战突击班”，前面战斗还未结束，就独自一人拿着刀冲下去，活捉二十个俘虏，缴到两支长枪，三支短枪。在丁堰战役中，蒋军残部一股二十余人突围逃窜时，立刻就遭到郭海波游击队的包围，蒋军不得不喊着“缴枪不缴命”，把全部美国武器放了下来。
  割断敌人的“输血管”
    当蒋军冒险深入的时候，蒋军后方的据点是空虚的，民兵游击队就紧张地战斗起来。他们曾拔除了南通的小海大小撇港，靖江的孤山、柏木桥等市镇，他们活跃在蒋军的运输线上，把蒋军的“输血管”割断了。
    通如线——这是连接蒋军进攻苏中的“桥头堡垒”，南通城和前哨战略要点如皋城的。在这条运输线上，民兵游击队广泛的展开游击战、麻雀战和破击战。七月三十一日，他们配合地方兵团，在丁堰南伏击，一次就烧毁蒋军七辆汽车，缴到一百余万发炮弹枪弹，蒋军输送给如皋二个师的给养都输送到他们这里来了。在另一次大破击战中，把三十多里公路破得像条遍体创伤的死蛇。蒋军改用电话联络，但是从白蒲到林梓的电话线又被民兵收割了五里。蒋军崭新的黄皮电线，扯起来隐蔽在田里，可是就在这一天晚上，都被游击队收割净了。蒋军从此不再用黄皮线，改用破旧的线拉在田里，但仍被游击队破坏。自此，蒋军再也没有信心架电话了，只得以小股武装进行联络。可是，民兵游击队却又进行袭扰和阻击，从四面八方打麻雀战………就这样，蒋军乃无法联络与供给。
    “蒋军到那里，就在那里展开游击！”已成为这里民兵游击队的行动口号。（新华社）
    【新华社华中二十一日电】苏皖一分区蒋军后方如皋、泰县、泰兴、靖江、紫石（新县）五个县民兵游击队在两个半月（九月底止）的保田保家自卫战中，获得了光辉战果。总计大小战斗一千一百零四次，俘蒋军官兵一千八百五十四名，毙蒋军三百十七名；缴获各式炮十门，各式机枪九十八挺，“汤姆”、“卡宾”、“加拿大”等枪六十三支，步枪九百十余支，短枪一百零五支，子弹二十万发。其中如皋县战果为全分区之冠，计俘蒋军八百六十六名，缴获中有轻重高射等机枪五十九挺，美式步枪五十一支。泰县作战最为频繁，达五百十余次，并生俘白米区“还乡团”团长王震东，击毙蒋“自卫队”营长宋渤。
