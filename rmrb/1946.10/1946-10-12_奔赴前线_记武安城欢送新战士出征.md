Heading to the Front Lines
    A Record of the Huan Song of New Soldiers Departing from Wu'an City
    Shi Hong, Yi Nong
    The 7th was a day with autumn heat, and the golden sun shone on Wu'an City. Now, the hearts of the people in this city are boiling even more fervently than the sun, because they know that the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is leading his men to snatch their fruits of liberation. Everyone said angrily and confidently:
    "The traitor Chiang Kai-shek wants to attack, we will turn Wu'an City upside down and defeat him!"
    The earth-shattering gongs and drums were struck from early in the morning.
    That morning, Wang Qifang, who had just gotten married, thought to himself, "At this time, where is there personal happiness!" So he didn't even enjoy his newly married life for long, and placed his bride with his mother, and went to join the team.
    A young water seller saw the glory of sending off the new soldiers to the front, and threw down his water buckets:
    "Carrying water for others for a lifetime, who says I'm glorious, if Chiang Kai-shek's army comes, the current time won't be guaranteed, and it won't be the same as suffering as before!" As he spoke, he joined the ranks of the new soldiers.
    The masses on fifteen streets cheered along the way: "Good men should join the Eighth Route Army, resolutely defend our good times after liberation, 'Guarantee that the families of soldiers will have no three difficulties: food, drink, and clothing!' Send off the patriotic and people-loving new soldiers to the front!"
    Brand-new clothes, carrying backpacks of calico and checkered cloth..., the mighty ranks of new soldiers, when passing through various streets, many steamed bun sellers took out hot steamed buns and kindly handed them to each new soldier: "You're walking a long way, take a few steamed buns to eat on the road!" Then pastry shops sent out pastries; those selling preserved vegetables also sent out preserved vegetables. ...
    The masses on fifteen streets crowded together, like the surging torrents of the Yellow River, to send off the new soldiers. Because they clearly realized that if Chiang Kai-shek's invasion is not defeated, all the happiness and light that has been obtained will be shattered. The crowd of send-offs thronged to the outskirts of the South Gate, and hundreds of flags of those who had turned over fluttered in the wind, forming a corridor for the new soldiers to pass through.
    Parents sending off their sons, new wives sending off their grooms, sons sending off their fathers... In the two or three li long line of send-offs, passionate farewells began:
    "When you get to the front, write more letters to report the news of victory!"
    Bai Li, who was the first to sign up for the army, told everyone with more confidence: "We will definitely be able to defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's attack, and after the victory, we will meet again!"
    Wang Hexi's elderly mother, who was over sixty years old, followed the send-off procession out of the city, suddenly remembered that her child's teacup was left at home, quickly ran back, took the teacup, and bought a large bag of persimmons and pears, hurriedly catching up with the ranks of the new soldiers, handing the teacup to her child, and distributing the pears and persimmons to her child and the soldiers in the same rank, saying: "Go happily! Joining the army is a good thing, I am also very honored that you are going! Defeat the traitor and come back!" Then she murmured: "When you leave home, you must take care of each other and listen to orders, three people with one heart, and barren land will turn into gold."
    A passionate response was sparked in the send-off procession, and cadre Zhang Qihua said: "If Hexi joins the army, you are our mother, we are all Hexi." The old lady's face was filled with smiles when she heard this, "Good! I have so many Hexis!" Then she immediately caught up with Hexi and repeatedly urged, "Don't miss home, listen to your superiors..."

    The people who were sending off stood on the earthen hill, watching the new soldiers' well-organized队伍 marching bravely towards the front lines. Zhao Tianyun's wife, from Shagou Street, who was sending off her son to join the army, said to her two children (one twelve years old and one six years old) on the way back:
    "Joining the army is so glorious! When you grow up to seventeen or eighteen, go join the army too, and let your mother be glorious again!"

　　奔赴前线
    记武安城欢送新战士出征
    史洪　一农
    七号这天，是一个秋老虎的天气，金色的太阳，照射着武安城。现在，这城里人民的心比太阳更加火热的沸腾起来，因为他们知道卖国贼蒋介石带着人马来抢他的翻身果实了。他们每人都气愤而自信的说着：
    “卖国贼蒋介石要进攻，俺们把武安城翻过来，都非打败它不可！”
    震天的锣鼓，一清早就敲打起来。
    这天早晨，刚结婚的王其芳心里想着：“这时候，那还有个人的幸福！”于是他连新婚生活都不久过，就把新娘安置给他母亲，投奔队里去了。
    一个卖水的小伙子看见欢送新战士出征的光荣，把水担子一扔：
    “给人家担一辈子水，谁说我个光荣，蒋介石的军队来了，现在的时光也保不住，还不是和从前一样的受罪！”他说着，就投入新战士的行列。
    十五条街的群众，在夹道欢呼：“好男儿要参加八路军，坚决保卫我们翻身后的好时光，‘保证抗属三不难：有吃、有喝、又有穿！’欢送爱国爱民的新战士出征！”
    崭新的衣服，背着花布和方格布…………的背包，雄纠纠的新战士的行列，从各个街道经过时，许多卖馍馍取出热馍，亲切的递给每个新战士：“走远路哩，带上几个馍路上吃！”接着点心铺里送出点心；卖十香菜的也送出十香菜。………
    十五条街的群众拥挤着，像黄河汹涌的激流一样，来欢送新战士。因为他们很清楚的认识到，不把蒋介石的进犯打败，一切已得的快乐和光明，将要破灭的。欢送的人群，拥到南关外的郊野，几百面翻了身的旗帜，迎风飘扬，架成了新战士经过的走廓。
    父母送儿子、新妇送新郎、儿子送父亲…………在二三里长欢送的行列中，开始了热情的道别：
    “到前边，多写信来，报告打胜仗的消息！”
    第一个报名参军的白里更有信心的告诉大家：“我们一定能打败卖国贼蒋介石的进攻，胜利后，再见！”
    王贺喜的六十多岁的老母亲随着欢送的行列走出了城，忽然又想到孩子的茶缸子忘在家里，赶快跑回去，取了茶缸子，并买了一大包柿子梨儿，急忙赶上新战士的行列，一面把茶缸子递给孩子，又把梨、柿，分给孩子与同一行列的战士，一面说：“你们高高兴兴的去吧！参军是好事，你们去了我也很光荣！把卖国贼打败，再回来！”接着又喃喃地说：“出了门，可要互相关照听命令，三人一条心，黄土变成金。”
    送行的行列中掀起了热情的感应，干部张其华说：“贺喜参军了你也就是俺们的娘，俺们都是贺喜。”老太太听到这话脸上充满笑容“好呀！我有这么多的贺喜！”说着又立刻赶上贺喜连声叮嘱“不要想家，听上级话”…………
    …………………………
    …………………………
    欢送的人们，立在土岗子上，望着新战士整理了好的队伍，勇往直前的奔向前线去了，沙沟街欢送儿子参军的赵天云的老婆，在回来路上，对她领着两个孩子（一个十二岁，一个六岁）说：
    “参军多光荣！等你长到十七八岁，也去参军，叫娘再光荣光荣！”
