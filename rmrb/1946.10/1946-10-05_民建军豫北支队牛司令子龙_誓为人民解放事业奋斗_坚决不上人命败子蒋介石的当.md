Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 2nd. Chiang Kai-shek recently ordered special agents—Song Yuanyun, inspector of the First Administrative Inspectorate of Henan, and Yue Zhuoyuan, senior counselor of the Ministry of National Defense and director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters' Statistics Office—to separately instigate Commander Niu Zilong of the People's Self-Defense Army's Yubei Detachment’s nephew to lobby him, attempting to induce Niu to betray the people. This was sternly rejected by Niu, who also rebuked his nephew. The reporter interviewed Commander Niu on this matter in a certain location. Commander Niu said: "On May 20, 1929, in order to rescue a friend from prison, I participated in the Military Commission's special agent work and did things that were harmful and immoral. But my fate was that because of 'unstable thinking,' I was subjected to foreign torture—non-judicial beatings to the point of death five times, and I spent three years and seven months in prison." He said painfully, "Chiang Kai-shek is a trafficker in human lives; he is also ruthless and heartless towards the special agents who have worked for him. Zhao Lijun, the major general of the First War Zone's Supervisory Group, a lieutenant general staff officer of the Military Commission, and a well-known special agent leader in Henan, assassinated Tang Youren on Chiang's orders. Chiang Kai-shek once took a photo with him and issued an edict calling Zhao a 'martyr who has not died.' However, before long, this 'martyr who has not died' was finally shot by Chiang Kai-shek in Luoyang on December 31, 1940. Tian Kai, the special agent who shot and killed worker Hu Shihe in Chongqing, didn't he also become Chiang Kai-shek's scapegoat? Their sending someone to me is to take my life. My current position is the people's position; don't even think about sowing discord between us and the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army!" Speaking of this, Commander Niu suddenly laughed. He said, "Don't treat everyone like children! Didn't you (referring to Chiang) say that you would kill all the Communists by the end of the year? I am not far from death either, so why do you need me?" Commander Niu said that when he resolutely rebuked his nephew this time, he told him, "I have been fooled enough. You can tell the Chiang family's special agents that I will not be a Tian Kai. Even if they kill all my family members, I will fight to the end for the people's liberation cause!"

　　民建军豫北支队牛司令子龙
    誓为人民解放事业奋斗
    坚决不上人命败子蒋介石的当
    【新华社邯郸二日电】蒋介石日前命令特务——河南的第一专署视察员宋元运与国防部高级参议、郑州绥署调统室主任岳烛远，分别唆使民主建国军豫北支队司令牛子龙氏之侄前来游说，企图诱使牛氏背叛人民，当遭牛氏严正拒绝，并责斥其侄。记者为此特走访牛司令于某地，牛司令说：“在民国十八年五月二十日，为了营救朋友出狱，我参加过军事委员会的特务工作，作过伤天害理的事。可是我的下场是因为‘思想不稳’挨了外国锤——非刑打死五次，并坐了三年零七个月的牢狱。”他沉痛地说：“蒋介石是个人命贩子，对于给他出过力的特务，他也是反目无情。第一战区少将督导组长军委会中将参谋，河南有名的特务头子赵理君，曾奉蒋命刺死唐有壬，蒋介石曾和他携手摄影，并下谕称赵为‘未死的烈士’。然而，曾几何时，这位‘未死的烈士’终于民国二十九年十二月三十一日被蒋介石枪毙在洛阳了。在重庆枪杀工人胡世合的特务田凯，不是也做了蒋介石的替死鬼吗？他们要我去，是要我的命，我现在的立场是人民的立场，休想挑拨离间我们和共产党八路军的亲密关系！”谈到这里，牛司令突然笑了。他说：“别把人都看成小孩吧！你（指蒋）不是说年底就杀完共产党吗？我也离死不远了，何必要我呢？”牛司令说，这次他毅然斥走侄儿时，曾对侄儿说：“我上当上够了，你可以告诉蒋家的特务们，我是不做田凯的。即使他们杀完了我的家属，我也要为人民的解放事业奋斗到底！”
