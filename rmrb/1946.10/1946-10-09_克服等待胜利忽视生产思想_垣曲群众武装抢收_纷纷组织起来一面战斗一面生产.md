　　【This newspaper Yangcheng, 7th dispatch】 The masses in Yuanqu, overcoming the ideology of waiting for victory and neglecting production, have armed themselves to carry out an emergency harvesting and crop protection campaign. After the Chiang troops occupied Yuanqu city and Xiguojiashan in the fifth district of Wangwu, local cadres and the masses generally held the view that "As long as the die-hard troops are driven away, it doesn't matter if the autumn harvest isn't gathered. If the die-hard troops can't be driven away, we won't be able to eat the grain even if we harvest it…" There was a tendency to wait for victory and neglect production. After the masses in Wuhen, Yingyan, Baihe and other villages were displaced, all the millet was blown away by the wind. Seeing this phenomenon, the local headquarters convened an emergency meeting of the headquarters of various villages on September 2nd, proposing "one side war, one side production," and stating that "the headquarters is not only in command of the war, but also the leader of production," calling on the people to arm themselves and launch a crash autumn harvest. After the meeting, all villages organized themselves. In Beihe, Nanpu, Xiyang, Nanshan and other villages, armed harvesting teams of more than 200 people were organized, and they helped Wuhen, Yingyan and other villages harvest more than 200 mu of millet in half a day. An armed emergency harvesting campaign is now being actively launched.

    垣曲群众武装抢收
    纷纷组织起来一面战斗一面生产
    【本报阳城七日电】垣曲群众克服等待胜利忽视生产的思想，武装起来进行抢收护秋运动。蒋军侵占垣曲城与王屋五区西郭家山后，当地干部和群众普遍的存在着“只要把顽军打走，秋不收亦行，顽军走不了，收下粮食也吃不上………………。”等待胜利忽视生产的偏向。无恨、英言、白鹤等村群众转移后，谷子全被风吹光了。当地指挥部看到这种现象，九月二日召开了各村指挥部紧急会议，提出“一面战争，一面生产”，并提出“指挥部不仅是指挥战争，又是生产的领导者”，号召武装起来，突击秋收。会议后，各村都纷纷组织起来。北鹤、南蒲、西阳、南山等村，组织二百余人的武装抢收队，半天时间即帮助无恨、英言等村，割完二百余亩谷子。现正积极展开武装抢收运动。
