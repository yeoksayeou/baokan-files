　　A Picture of National Industrial Growth
    ——Remembering Mr. Guo Jingru and the Jingxing Factory
    Mu Yue
    In Xingtai, I witnessed the growth of China's national industry, namely the development of the iron industry. Before the war, there were only three iron workshops in Xingtai with forty workers. During the period of enemy occupation, due to the enemy's need to plunder cotton, they forcibly built water conservancy projects and allocated waterwheels, and the number of iron factories once increased to fifteen, with more than seventy workers. But it was only after liberation that it truly became active. Within a year, the number of factories increased to twenty-one, and the number of workers increased to one hundred and ninety-eight. The development of the Taihang textile industry is the main factor stimulating the development of the Xingtai iron industry. People from the mountains crowded the factory gates to buy cotton carding bows. The factories processed day and night, but still couldn't meet the demand. The development of the iron industry has made a great contribution to the textile industry. A cotton carding machine can card sixty catties of cotton per day, which is five or six times more than a stringed cotton carding bow. Mr. Guo Jingru, the manager of the Jingru Tool Factory, recently created a drawing frame, which will increase the productivity of spinning by seven or eight times, thus greatly helping the development of the textile industry.
    The experiment of Guo Jingru's drawing frame went through a tortuous and difficult road. Guo is a machine worker who worked in the Jinzhang Mining Bureau in Zhangjiakou for more than ten years. He said that he started researching the drawing frame at the age of eighteen, and failed twice in the middle. "Not only did I lose money, but I also aroused everyone's criticism, thinking that Guo Jingru was easy to fool." His colleagues in the factory did not agree. Now, with the support of the democratic government, Guo Jingru has established the Jingxing Iron Factory, making cotton carding bows on the one hand and experimenting with the drawing frame on the other. His painstaking efforts of more than ten years have blossomed and borne fruit in the liberated areas. The drawing frame was successfully tested, and at the Xingtai City Workers' Congress held on October 30th, the municipal government awarded him a certificate of honor and a red silk banner "A Wish Fulfilled." He said: "This can be considered realized."
    When it was first liberated, Guo Jingru's factory was in difficulty. He borrowed 20,000 yuan from the democratic government to support it. Later, he borrowed another 500,000 yuan from the Jinnan Bank to buy lathes and furniture. Guo Jingru said: The democratic government not only supported me financially, but also gave me great confidence. Not long after the liberation of Xingtai, Director Shang of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce visited me. Knowing that I had worked on spinning machines, he encouraged me, telling me that the government could provide loans to help, and that if it was successful, the government would reward me, and if it failed, the government would be responsible. With such enthusiastic support from the government, how could I not do it? This is something I never dreamed of for many years!
    When Guo Jingru established the Jingxing Factory in March, he had a capital of 250,000 yuan. What about now? According to Guo himself: It's probably around two million. The factory is getting more and more prosperous. Including apprentices, there are already sixteen workers. In August, they produced eleven manual cotton carding bows and four horse-drawn cotton carding bows. They sold all eleven as soon as they made them, and they were all delivered after payment. In addition, they may sell some cotton gins and parts to distant places. The total sales per month can reach one hundred and twenty to thirty thousand.
    Talking about the recent production plan, Guo Jingru said: Now there is a shortage of spinning bows and cotton gins everywhere in the mountains. I have borrowed another 400,000 yuan from the Jinnan Bank to collect old and broken cotton gins in the countryside and re-equip and repair them to supply the mountains. Guo Jingru also has an ideal, which is to build a drawing frame manufacturing factory to manufacture his newly invented drawing frame. He said that if the drawing frame is promoted, such a factory can be built to organize cotton ginning, carding, drawing, and weaving in a series. Guo said: With the leadership of the democratic government, I believe my ideal will be realized.

　　一幅民族工业滋长图
    ——记郭镜如先生与镜兴工厂
    慕岳
    在邢台我看到了中国民族工业的滋长，这就是铁工业的发展，这些铁工作坊，战前邢台只有三家，工人四十名，敌占时期，由于敌人需要掠夺棉花，强迫兴修水利，配给水车，铁工厂一度增加至十五厂，工人七十余名；而解放后才真正活跃起来，一年间，厂子增加至二十一家，工人增至一百九十八名。太行纺织业的发展是刺激邢台铁工业发展的主要因素，山上来买弹花弓的挤破厂门，工厂日夜加工，还是供不应求。铁工业的发展，对纺织业有伟大的贡献，一架弹花机每天可以弹六十斤花，比起拉弦的弹花弓，出货大五六倍，镜如工具厂的经理郭镜如先生最近创造抽线机，将把纺线的生产力提高七八倍，这样就帮助了纺织业大大的发展。
    郭镜如抽线机的试验经过曲折困难的道路，郭是一个机器工人，在张家口锦张矿务局干过十几年，他说，他十八岁就开始研究抽线机，中间失败过两次，“赔了钱不说，还惹起大家的非议，认为郭镜如好胡弄”，他同厂的伙计，都不赞成，现在郭镜如在民主政府的赞助下，建立了镜兴铁工厂，一面造弹花弓，一面就试验抽线机，他这一十多年的心血，在解放区里开花结果了，抽线机试验成功，市政府在十月三十日举行的邢台市职工大会上，奖给他一张荣誉奖状，一面红色锦旗“一桩心愿”，他说：“这可算是实现了”。
    刚解放的时候，郭镜如的厂，是困难的，向民主政府贷了两万元，才支持过去，以后从冀南银行又贷了五十万，才买到车床和家俱，郭镜如说：民主政府不仅在经济上支持了我，也给我以很大的信心，邢台解放不久，工商局的商局长就访问过我，知道我曾经弄过纺线机，就鼓励我，告诉我，政府可以贷款帮助，并且说要是成功了，政府奖励，失败了由政府负责，政府这样的热情扶持，我那能不干呢，这是我多年做梦都没有梦到的事情呵！
    郭镜如三月成立镜兴工厂的时候，自己有资本二十五万，现在呢？根据郭自己说：大概两百万上下了，厂里一天一天红火起来，连学徒已有十六个工人，八月份出十一个人力弹花弓，四个马拉弹花弓，做十一个就销十一个还都是先交款，后交货，除此之外，可能远销出一些榨花机和零件，一月共可售价一百二三十万。
    谈到最近的生产计划，郭镜如说：现在山上到处纺织弓缺，榨花机也缺，我又从冀南银行贷了四十万、到乡间去搜集破旧的榨花机把它们从新装置和修理，好供给山上用。郭镜如还有一个理想，便是建设一个抽线机制造工厂，制造他新近发明的抽线机，他说要是抽线机推广了，就可以建设这样的工厂，把轧花，弹花，抽线，织布，都系列的组织起来。郭说：有民主政府领导，我相信我的理想一定会实现。
