Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd. The powerful militia in the Shandong Liberated Areas have launched ingenious landmine and sniper warfare along the Jiaoji Railway and in the edge areas of Southern Shandong, making it impossible for the Chiang Kai-shek army to realize its plans for conscription and grain robbery. In the Luzhong District, the Gao Yuncheng Explosives Team, the Li Yuquan Expeditionary Team, etc., have killed or wounded more than 1,400 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers (from battalion commander downwards) in the Zibo area and on both its east and west sides in the past month, and seized more than 70 rifles and machine guns. The Chiang Kai-shek army's 73rd and 8th Armies are preparing to conscript 10,000 men, but their plan will be foiled by the anti-conscription struggle launched by the armed work teams among the masses. In the Bohai District, the militia joint defense team in the Xiaoqing River area north of the Jiaoji Railway carried out more than 110 raids in the three months of June, July and August alone, annihilating 790 puppet soldiers and capturing 38 machine guns and more than 20 long and short guns. Since the beginning of September, the militia has cooperated with the broad masses to launch an anti-grain-robbery struggle, repelling 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in the Zidong Zihe area in one instance, and rescuing hundreds of conscripted laborers. The militia also strictly enforced the policy of emptying houses and clearing the fields, so that the Chiang Kai-shek army could not obtain a single grain of food. Under the skillful attacks of Yu Liangzhai, the head of the militia joint defense team, the Chiang Kai-shek army no longer dares to harass the area east of the Zihe River. The Zhangdian Village militia participation teams operate in the Chiang Kai-shek army's rear, fighting more than a thousand battles in the past two months, killing or wounding more than a hundred Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. In the Binhai District, the militia, in coordination with the local armed forces, raided the Shuangling stronghold six miles south of Jiaoxian city on the night of the 22nd of last month, repelling more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Jiaocheng who came to reinforce it, killing or wounding more than a hundred Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. When a hundred Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Anqiu attempted to conscript soldiers and rob grain in Dabaizhuang, northeast of the city, they triggered a landmine as soon as they entered the village, and the militia village protection team fired three volleys of earthen cannons, causing the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers to flee in panic. In Tengxian County, Southern Shandong, the first batch of 2,000 militiamen have rushed to the self-defense front. In addition, a "flying explosives team" composed of more than a hundred people is making gunpowder, pounding thunder caps, and rushing to make landmines day and night.
