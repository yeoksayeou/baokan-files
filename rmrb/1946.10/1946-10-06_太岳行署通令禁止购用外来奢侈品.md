　　[This Dispatch from Yangcheng, 4th] The Taiyue Administrative Office recently issued a circular to the entire region's government system: Banks, Industry and Commerce, Taxation, Postal Service, Public Security and other directly subordinate organs, as well as district and village cadres, are prohibited from purchasing all foreign luxury goods and consumables. It calls on cadres at all levels to become models in advocating the use of local goods, in order to promote and influence the masses. It pointed out that border areas and the Pingyao-Jiexiu area should pay particular attention. The Yuebei Taxation Bureau also issued a call a few days ago, advocating the purchase of local goods on the one hand, and inspecting grain smuggling on the other. The Lingshi County Government has formulated reward measures for this purpose, stipulating that if those who uncover such activities are militiamen or the masses, they will receive a 30% reward; government and civilian personnel will receive a 20% reward.
