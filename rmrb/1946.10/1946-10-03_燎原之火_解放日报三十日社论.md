A Prairie Fire
Liberation Daily, 30th Editorial

In recent months, the movement of peasants in the Kuomintang-controlled areas resisting Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule has risen to an unprecedented high. Peasants have organized to resist levies, conscription, donations, rice grabbing, anti-drafting, punishing traitors, and settling scores with local bullies. This movement has spread throughout the provinces under Chiang’s control. In Sichuan, Hunan, and the Jiangnan regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, large-scale peasant uprisings have already emerged. In over sixty counties in northern, eastern, western, southern, and central Sichuan, more than twenty counties in Jiangnan, and vast areas of Hunan, over 200,000 peasants have taken up arms and are victoriously engaged in struggle. The rebel army's momentum is majestic, and it is increasingly demonstrating a higher level of awareness and organization. In addition to peasants, coolies, handicraft workers, urban poor, and deserters have also joined in. In some areas, local governments or strictly disciplined armies have even begun to be established. In order to suppress this movement and eliminate this hidden danger, Chiang Kai-shek used large armies for "encirclement and suppression," resulting in repeated and disastrous defeats. Many local security teams and even regular troops "mutinied," and the peasant armed forces grew more and more with each "suppression." The sparks are about to reach a point where they can ignite a prairie fire.

This vigorously developing peasant movement first exposes how weak the foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule is and how isolated his power is. The economic foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's comprador feudal fascist rule is mainly the cruel plunder of the peasants. He can absolutely not solve the basic problem of modernizing China - the peasant problem. He has issued many beautiful checks, such as "25% rent reduction," "one-year suspension of land tax," and even "land to the tiller," as a deceptive gesture to ease the resistance of the vast number of peasants against him. But none of these checks have been cashed, and Chiang Kai-shek will never be able to cash them. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's rule cannot but be a disaster for the Chinese people. This is the basic weakness of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and cannot be remedied. Especially now, in order to wage a full-scale civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has to collect more grain, extort more money, and seize more recruits in the countryside, which results in more widespread and more serious natural disasters in Chiang-controlled areas. The vast number of peasants are driven to the point of being unable to endure it any longer, realizing that only resolute resistance is the way to get rid of the "Chiang disaster." Now this resistance movement is rapidly and unprecedentedly developing. Although Chiang Kai-shek has adopted a cruel policy of "taking heads first" to suppress it, he has definitely failed to suppress it. Chiang-controlled areas have now reached this point: the ruled can no longer live, and the rulers can no longer rule. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek has now used 85% of his troops to attack the Liberated Areas, leaving the rear empty, which gives the movement more room for broad development. The people of the Liberated Areas are thus powerfully supporting their brothers and sisters in Chiang-controlled areas. Although the peasant movement in Chiang-controlled areas is still only in its initial stage today, its strength is still very scattered, and its organizational awareness needs to be further improved. There are still many difficulties in its path forward, and it will encounter many temporary setbacks; but due to the just nature of this movement and the favorable conditions that exist at present, its development prospects are limitless.

Today, the hopes of all the people in the country are pinned on the victory of the self-defense war to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Contrary to Chiang's rule, the democratic government in the Liberated Areas can thoroughly implement rent and interest reduction and implement land to the tiller by appropriate means, enabling the peasants, who account for 80% of the total population, to stand up. Therefore, in the face of Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, the people of the Liberated Areas can provide their endless strength and just self-defense war in order to defend their own vital interests, and ensure the most basic and most accurate guarantee of the victory of the self-defense war. The fundamental key to Chiang's army's inevitable defeat and our army's inevitable victory lies here. Today, the growing peasant movement in Chiang-controlled areas will become the main component of the democratic movement in Chiang-controlled areas, directly cooperating with the self-defense war of the army and people in the Liberated Areas. It gives the army and people in the Liberated Areas great encouragement. It is a powerful wing for the people of the whole country to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Compatriots across the country should give it strong support. In particular, the people's democratic movement in the cities of Chiang-controlled areas should be closely integrated with this peasant struggle. All democrats should serve the peasants more and establish a solid foundation for their own movement. Cooperating with the continuous victories of the army and people in the Liberated Areas, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive will surely be crushed, the suffering of the vast number of peasants in Chiang-controlled areas will surely be lifted, and China's independence, peace, and democracy will surely be realized.

　　燎原之火
    解放日报三十日社论
    近几月来，国民党统治区农民反抗蒋介石虐政的运动空前高涨，农民们组织起来抗派、抗征、抗捐、抢米、反抓丁、惩奸、清算恶霸的运动遍及蒋管区各省，川、湘以及苏浙、皖江南地区且已出现规模庞大的民变，全川北、东、西、南、中六十余县，江南二十余县以及湖南广大地区二十多万农民，已经拿起武器斗争和胜利地进行着斗争。起义军声势雄伟，并且日益具有较高的觉悟性和组织性。除了农民以外，苦力、手工业工人、城市贫民、逃兵也纷纷参加，有的地区甚至已经开始建立地方政权或纪律严明的军队。蒋介石为了镇压这一运动除此心腹大患，曾用大军“围剿”，结果屡遭惨败，很多地方保安队甚至正规部队纷纷“哗变”，农民武装越“剿”越多，星星之火，快要达到可以燎原的程度。
    这一蓬勃发展的农民运动，首先暴露出蒋介石反动统治的根基是何等薄弱，它的力量是何等孤单。蒋介石的买办封建法西斯统治的经济基础，主要的就是对农民的残酷掠夺，他绝对不可能解决使中国现代化的基本问题——农民问题，他曾开尽了漂亮的支票如“二五减租”，“停征田赋一年”甚至“耕者有其田”等等作为欺骗的样子来缓和广大农民对它的反抗，但这些支票一概没有兑现，蒋介石也决不可能使它们兑现。因此，蒋介石的统治，就不能不是中国人民的灾难，这是蒋介石反动统治的基本弱点，是无法挽救的。尤其在现在，蒋介石为了全面内战，不能不在农村中征收更多的粮食，勒索更多的钱财，抓更多的壮丁，其结果便是蒋管区更加普遍和更加严重的天灾。广大农民逼得忍无可忍，觉悟到只有坚决反抗才是摆脱“蒋灾”的出路，现在这一反抗运动，正迅速空前发展，尽管蒋介石采取“杀头着手”的残酷镇压政策，但已决然压不下去了。现在的蒋管区已经到了这个地步，被统治者已经活不下去了，统治者已经统治不下去了，加以蒋介石今天已把他百分之八十五的兵力用来进攻解放区，后方兵力空虚，这使运动更有广阔发展的余地，解放区的人民就是这样有力地支援着他们蒋管区的弟兄们。蒋管区农民运动今天虽然还只在开始，力量还很分散，组织性觉悟性还须要进一步提高，在它的前进道路上还摆着很多的困难，还会遭到许多暂时的挫折；但由于这个运动的正义性和目前存在着有利的条件，其发展前途是不可限量的。
    今天全国人民的一切希望都寄托在粉碎蒋介石进攻的自卫战的胜利上，正和蒋家统治相反，解放区的民主政府能够彻底贯彻减租减息并用适当方法实行耕者有其田，使占全人口百分之八十的农民翻身，因此解放区人民在蒋介石的进攻前面为了保卫他们自己的切身利益，能够提供他们无穷尽的力量与正义的自卫战争，而使自卫战的胜利得到最基本和最确切的保证，蒋军必败我军必胜根本的关键就在这里。今天蒋管区日益壮大的农民运动，将成为蒋管区民主运动的主要的构成部分，直接地配合解放区军民的自卫战争，它给解放区军民以莫大的鼓舞，它是全中国人民粉碎蒋介石进攻有力的一翼，全国同胞应该对它作有力的声援，尤其是蒋管区城市中的人民民主运动要和这个农民斗争密切结合起来，一切民主人士要更多的为农民服务，并为自己的运动确立牢固不拔的基础，这样配合着解放区军民接连不断的胜利，蒋介石的进攻一定被粉碎，蒋管区广大农民的痛苦一定被解除，中国的独立、和平、民主一定能实现。
