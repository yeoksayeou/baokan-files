　　[Weixian dispatch, 29th of this month] Following the enthusiastic land donations of Yang Zhixuan, speaker of the Jize County Council, and Section Chief Han of the Nanhe County Government, many cadres in Southern Hebei have recently been actively donating land they cannot cultivate themselves to farmers. Lu Tianlin, head of the Administrative Office's Production Section, donated 30 mu of land; Wang Xingshe of the Education Department, 43 mu; Jia Dongchen of the Industry and Commerce Tax Bureau, 20 mu; Wang Yun of the Public Security Bureau, 16 mu; Jiao Zhixue, more than 10 mu; and Secretary Zhang of the Secretariat, 11 mu. Zhang Huanan, deputy section chief of the First Special District's Judicial Section, donated 20 mu, Liu Huanqun, secretary of the Weixian County Government, 40 mu, and Section Chief Wang, 60 mu. The wave of land donations is also gradually spreading among village cadres and the masses. Liu Wangshi, a martyr's family member from He Zhao in Weixian County, and her mother-in-law voluntarily donated 100 mu of fertile land in two installments. Because she is a martyr's family member, the masses urged her to take it back, but she felt deeply cared for by the masses and insisted on donating it. When the masses accepted her land, they all expressed that they would take good care of her livelihood. In addition, He Ganchen from Dongwang in Ningnan donated 15 mu, Yan Fenglin donated 24 mu, and Ma Zongmao donated 15 mu. They also handed over the autumn harvest to poor people to reap, which was praised by the broad masses.
