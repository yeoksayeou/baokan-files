　　Xinhua News Agency, Chifeng, 27th (Urgent Dispatch): After two days and nights of fierce fighting in central Hebei, the Eighth Route Army recovered Ningcheng, located over 100 li southeast of Chifeng, at 6 PM on the 25th. The city was seized by Chiang's troops on August 22nd. In this battle, the entire 3rd Regiment of the Nationalist Army's 18th Provisional Division of the 93rd Army, consisting of more than 1,600 men, was wiped out. In addition, one American-made P-51 fighter plane was shot down. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. The recovery of Ningcheng has dealt a severe blow to Chiang's troops in Hebei who were advancing toward Chifeng along the Ye (Baishou)-Chi (feng) road. The Eighth Route Army, active around Ye Baishou and Lingyuan, increasingly threatens the central section of the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway. The democratic government has entered Ningcheng with the army to appease and provide relief to suffering compatriots.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chifeng, 26th: Our correspondent at the front lines in Hebei reported: The Nationalist Central News Agency has repeatedly announced that the city of Chifeng has been seized and controlled by Chiang's troops. However, the city is still being firmly defended by the local army and people. Order within the city is extremely calm and good. Inspired by the constant news of victories at the front, the citizens are actively supporting the war of self-defense.
    Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 28th: A regiment of American-equipped Chiang's troops, which advanced northwest from Jimo, was annihilated. On the 24th, the 198th Division of Chiang's 54th Army dispatched the entire 593rd Regiment and four companies of the 592nd Regiment, totaling more than 2,000 soldiers, from Jimo in two routes to advance northwest of the city. The eastern route, the 593rd Regiment, attacked Tuanwan and Taishezhuang (both located more than 40 li north of Lancun). The Eighth Route Army and the militia immediately launched a self-defense counterattack, with a portion of their forces maneuvering to the area between Tuanwan and Taishezhuang to encircle them. In one fell swoop, the majority of the regiment was annihilated, with only a few survivors managing to escape. The western route, consisting of four companies of the 592nd Regiment, attacked Helizhuang (more than 20 li north of Lancun) and was also severely attacked, resulting in a hasty retreat. In this battle, the Chiang army left behind 811 bodies. The army captured two 60mm mortars, nine American-made machine guns, more than 70 rifles, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Detailed battle results are still being tallied.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 27th: The Fu-puppet troops who fled toward eastern Suiyuan and western Chahar have been met with a forceful counterattack by the Eighth Route Army. The troops of Cao Han, a subordinate of the Fu-puppet army, occupied Haoqian, south of Shangyi City in western Chahar, on the 22nd. The Eighth Route Army recovered it on the evening of the 25th. The Eighth Route Army also took advantage of the victory to recover the Taiji Temple west of Shangyi. The Fu-puppet troops continue to flee westward. Another unit of Fu-puppet troops invaded Shangdu City from Jining on the 16th, but was bravely repelled by the local army and people. Xinghe City in eastern Suiyuan was seized by a unit of Fu-puppet troops on the afternoon of the 26th. The Eighth Route Army is currently confronting them in the suburbs.
