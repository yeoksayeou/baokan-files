Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd (Delayed) General Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, issued a statement to reporters today, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's "Eight Demands" as a trick to cover up his new offensive. The reporter asked what Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Northeast army deployment locations as planned in June this year should be implemented on schedule" meant. General Commander Lin replied: "I don't know what his so-called 'plan' is! If it refers to the unreasonable demands he made through Marshall in June, asking us to withdraw from areas such as Heihe, it is tantamount to expressing his further ambitions today, wanting to use his dreamed-up 'plan' as an excuse for a large-scale offensive in the Northeast." General Commander Lin recounted Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of the January 13th ceasefire order, the February 27th Northeast ceasefire agreement, and the June 7th Northeast ceasefire order, as well as the current offensive by Chiang's troops in the Tonghua area, calling on the military and civilians of the Northeast to wholeheartedly and resolutely resist, so that Chiang's troops would not have the opportunity to adjust, replenish, and transfer, exhausting them, striking them, and annihilating them! General Commander Lin said: "The manpower of our liberated areas is endless; the people who have turned themselves around, fighting for national independence and democratic survival, will never be exhausted. If the invaders firmly refuse to withdraw from the areas they have occupied in violation of orders, in order to achieve true democratic peace, we must mobilize the power of all the people in the Northeast to drive them back to their original positions!"

　　林彪将军揭穿蒋介石和平烟幕
    号召东北军民坚决抵抗把进犯者打回原来位置
    【新华社东北二十三日电】（迟到）东北民主联军总司令林彪将军今日向记者发表谈话，指斥蒋介石的“八项要求”乃是掩护其新进攻的花样。记者问以蒋介石所谓“今年六月间所拟议的东北军队驻地应即定期实行”，其涵义如何？林总司令答：“我不知道他的所谓‘拟议’是个什么东西！如果说就是六月间他经过马歇尔所提出的无理要求，要我们退出黑河等地区的话，那无异是表示他今天的进一步的野心，想用他梦想中的‘拟议’作为大举进攻东北的口实。”林总司令述蒋介石在东北破坏一月十三日停战令、二月二十七日东北停战协议、六月七日东北停战令的事实，与目前蒋军在通化方面的进攻，号召东北军民一心一意的坚决抵抗，使蒋军得不到调整补充和调动的机会，疲困他们，打击他们，歼灭他们！林总司令说：“我们解放区的人力是无尽的；翻了身的人民，为民族独立和民主生存而战，是永远也不会疲乏的。如果进犯者坚不退出违令侵占的地区，我们为了求得真正民主和平，就一定要动员全东北人民的力量，把他们打回原来的位置去！”
