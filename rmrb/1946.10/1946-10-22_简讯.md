　　After the liberation of Qin County, due to the democratic government's support of private capital and protection of free trade, the city gradually prospered within a month. The number of businesses that have been restored and newly opened has reached 148, of which only 18 are publicly or jointly publicly and privately operated, and the rest are all privately operated. The Jinnan Bank of Qin County lent 150,000 yuan to 23 merchants and civilians who suffered from the disaster caused by Chiang Kai-shek, helping them set up miscellaneous goods stalls and open restaurants, enabling them to earn 300 to 500 yuan per day. The 148 shops, 48 stalls, and 37 food stalls in the city have a total daily transaction volume of 1,539,000 yuan in local currency. Merchants and civilians all feel the joy of "free trade" and "public buying and public selling," and excitedly say: "In the past, doing business with trepidation would still result in losses. Now that the Eighth Route Army has come, business is booming and profits are flowing from all directions!"

　　The day after the liberation of Huo County, the city's businesses fully recovered, and even those that had been forced to close by Yan Xishan's puppet regime resumed operations. Currently, there are 103 businesses and 37 stalls in the city, with a complete range of goods. According to the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce: business transactions are one to two times higher than in previous years. In the past, the Tong Le Yuan restaurant had to pay money and grain to hire people to build碉堡 (fortifications) and dig fortifications. On average, it lost 700 yuan a day when it was open. It was forced to continue even with losses. Now, with free trade, it makes 3,000 yuan in business a day, earning a net profit of 1,000 yuan after deducting food, drink, and wages. (Zhang Yaode)

　　At the request of the Sanqu United Cooperative and the people of Shucun and other villages, the Wu'an County Government removed and arrested Meng Xin, the manager of the Sanqu United Cooperative, a major embezzler, for interrogation. The major crimes of this criminal include: (1) Unauthorized and large-scale use of public funds for personal gain. In early April, he used 315,000 yuan, a quarter of the textile wages, for his own oil business. He did not fully repay the money until the end of August. In June, he used 89,000 yuan from the United Cooperative to purchase two guns, which he sold for 110,000 yuan, embezzling over 20,000 yuan. In August, he again took 100,000 yuan from the Boyan Cooperative in the name of the United Cooperative and engaged in large-scale silk and satin trading. (2) Oppressing female spinners, using short weights to issue cotton, and heavy weights to collect yarn, owing female spinners 200,000 yuan in wages and delaying payment in order to use the money for personal gain. (3) Chaotic economic procedures and accounts. In addition, his lifestyle was extremely corrupt. He spent more than 30,000 yuan just on prostitutes. The Wu'an leadership is now using this case to educate cadres throughout the county to eliminate corruption and waste in order to benefit the patriotic self-defense war.

　　简讯
    沁县城解放后，由于民主政府扶植私人资本及保护贸易营业自由，在一个月内，城内渐呈繁荣景象，恢复与新开的商号已有一百四十八家，其中公营及公私合营的只有十八家，其余全为私营。沁县冀南银行贷出十五万元款子，给二十三家遭受蒋灾的商民，帮助他们摆杂货摊及开饭铺，使他们每天能赢利三百元到五百元。城内一百四十八家商号，四十八个摊贩，三十七家饭摊，总共每天交易可进本币一百五十三万九千元。商民都感到“自由贸易”和“公买公卖”的愉快，兴奋地说：“过去提心吊胆的做买卖还要倒赔本，如今八路军来了真是生意兴隆，利达三江呢！”
    霍县城解放后第二日，城内商号即完全恢复，连旧日被阎伪逼得闭门的也恢复了营业。现全城有商号一百零三家，摊贩三十七家，各样货物齐全。据商会会长称：商号买卖比往年多一倍到二倍，同乐园饭馆以前出款出粮，雇人支差修碉堡、挖工事，平均开门一天，赔钱七百元。赔钱也得被迫做下去，这回自由买卖，一天就作三千元买卖，除吃喝工资，净赚一千元。（张耀德）
    武安县政府应三区联合社与淑村等村人民之请，将大贪污犯三区联合社经理孟鑫撤职并逮捕审讯。该犯之罪恶，就其大者有：（一）擅自大量动用公款营私。四月初，以纺织工资的四分之一三十一万五千余元私作打油生意。至八月末始陆续交清该款。六月间以联合社款八万九千元购枪两支，以十一万卖出，从中贪污二万余元。八月间又以联合社名义在伯延合作社取款十万，大作绸缎买卖。（二）欺压纺妇，小秤发花，大秤收线，欠纺妇应得工资二十万元也推诿缓给，用以营私。（三）经济手续账目一塌糊涂。此外，生活也极腐化。光嫖女人就花过三万多元。武安领导上现正以此教育全县干部。肃清贪污浪费现象，以利爱国自卫战争。
