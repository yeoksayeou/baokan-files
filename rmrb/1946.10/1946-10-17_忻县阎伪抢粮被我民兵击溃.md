Xinhua News Agency, Xinkou, 14th -- The militia of Xinlu Village, ten miles northwest of Xin County, have repelled three incursions by Yan's puppet troops attempting to seize grain. On the 26th of last month, as the masses in the village were stepping up the autumn harvest, more than 300 members of Xin County's puppet police team suddenly arrived in the village to seize grain. The militia immediately put down their sickles, picked up rifles and hand grenades, and guarded the village entrance. When Yan's puppet troops approached, the militia immediately opened fire, and Yan's puppet troops fled in disarray. Subsequently, Yan's troops regrouped and invaded again, and after 20 minutes of fierce fighting, they were defeated again, with several people including a deputy squadron leader killed. The next day, this group of Yan's troops, carrying 20 large carts, changed direction and invaded northeast of Xinlu Village. While Yan's troops were rummaging through chests and cabinets searching for grain, the villagers' militia bravely rushed into the village, and Yan's troops fled in panic. On the 29th, 400 of Yan's troops stationed in Kuang Village, three miles north of Xin County, came to the village again to seize grain. The militia set up an ambush midway, and when they entered the ambush circle, they opened fire, and Yan's puppets immediately fled.
