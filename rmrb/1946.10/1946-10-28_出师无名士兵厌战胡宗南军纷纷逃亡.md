　　[This article was] transmitted by our newspaper's Yangcheng correspondent on the 26th: Since Hu Zongnan's troops entered southern Shanxi, the war-weariness of the soldiers has soared, and they are deserting in droves. According to Jiang army soldier Zhang Changgao of the First Regiment of the 167th Brigade, who deserted from Shucun, Hongdong on the 18th, a company had decreased from 140-150 men to less than 100, and some companies had only 50-odd men. On the same day, Guo Anmin and Wei Kejian, soldiers of the First Battalion of the 140th Regiment of the 47th Brigade, also deserted from Hanlüecun, Hongdong to our area. According to them, since the 47th Brigade crossed the Yellow River, they had been afraid to take off their clothes to sleep. Every time they arrived at a place, the officers forced them to build fortifications before allowing them to rest. At night, fearing attacks by the Eighth Route Army, they slept beside the fortifications, wearing only single layers of clothing even in the weather of September and October. Therefore, the soldiers were extremely unhappy about fighting and secretly discussed: "What's the point of Chinese people fighting Chinese people? It's better to go home and starve than to suffer these foreign tortures here."

　　出师无名士兵厌战胡宗南军纷纷逃亡
    【本报阳城二十六日电】胡宗南军进入晋南后，士兵厌战情绪高涨，纷纷逃亡。据十八日从洪洞蜀村逃来之蒋军一六七旅第一团士兵张昌高谈，一个连由一百四五十人已减少到一百人以下，甚至一个连只有五十多人。同日，又有四十七旅一四○团一营士兵郭安民、魏克建由洪洞韩略村逃来我区，据他们说，四十七旅自过黄河以来，就不敢脱衣睡觉，每到一地，官长先逼着做好工事，然后才许休息。黑夜，怕八路军袭击，都躺在工事旁边睡觉，九、十月天气，还穿着单衣。所以士兵都极不高兴打仗，偷偷地议论：“中国人打中国人有啥意思？回到家里挨饿也比在这里受洋罪强。”
