　　Our Army in Northern Henan Actively Counterattacks
    Captures Dou Gong, Captures Over Forty Chiang Kai-shek and Puppet Soldiers
    Gao Yifan
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Handan] During the self-defense battles in Northern Henan, our army has already created many model battle examples. On the 23rd, a unit of our Taihang army attacked Da Xia Getuo, west of the Tagang Station in Jixian County, annihilating a platoon of puppet Sun Dianying's troops, capturing over thirty people including the platoon leader, and seizing two light machine guns and twenty-seven rifles. On the morning of the 24th, during a self-defense counterattack, our Anyang army captured Dou Gong town, capturing over forty Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, including a regimental commander, and seizing one light machine gun and one grenade launcher each. In the afternoon, we also recovered Dingzhang, annihilating a battalion of puppet Cheng Daosheng's troops, capturing two hundred, and seizing twenty light machine guns. On the same night, our army in the Huixian area launched a counterattack against the puppet Sun Dianying's troops, immediately defeating two platoons of the 2nd Regiment of the 8th Brigade of that unit who were holding the satellite strongholds in Wangcun Town (more than ten miles east of the city). The seven remaining troops who stubbornly resisted in a bunker west of the village were finally buried inside the bunker amidst explosions. The Military Region Headquarters pointed out: The above two battles are indeed model battle examples, and even annihilating a battalion or a platoon of the enemy is worth promoting. The Military Region also called on the soldiers and civilians throughout the region to continue their efforts and create more examples of annihilating the enemy.
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Changzhi on the 28th] Gao Yifan, reporter from Taihang Xinhua Daily on the Northern Henan Front, reported from Shuiye on the 27th: I heard a broadcast from the Central News Agency in the Shuiye Eighth Route Army × Headquarters stating: Chiang's army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army in the Liuhegou area of Shuiye. I am currently stationed in the peaceful city of Shuiye and have not heard any gunfire. I only see teams of Eighth Route Army soldiers and militiamen singing war songs, heading to the front line to encircle Qugou and other places occupied by Chiang's army. The 1,500 businesses in Shuiye city are operating as usual, factories are operating day and night, and farmers have mostly finished harvesting autumn crops. Groups of farmers are carrying cotton, grain, and vegetables to supply the city, with daily cotton sales reaching 50,000 jin. Shuiye is heavily guarded, with good order, and stands within range of Chiang's army's field artillery, as an insurmountable city.

    【本报邯郸讯】豫北我军自卫作战中，已创造出许多模范战例。二十三日太行我军一部，出击汲县塔岗车站以西的大小圪驼，消灭伪孙殿英一个排，俘排长以下三十余人，缴轻机枪两挺、步枪二十七支。二十四日上午，安阳我军于自卫反击中，攻克窦公镇俘蒋伪团长以下四十余人，缴轻机枪掷弹筒各一。下午，又收复定张，消灭伪程道生一个营，俘二百，缴轻机枪二十挺。同日夜，辉县方面我军向伪孙殿英部展开反击，当将该部八总队二团据守王村镇（城东十余里）卫星据点两个排击溃，据村西一碉堡内顽抗的残部七人，最后亦在爆炸声中埋葬碉堡内。军区司令部指出：以上两个战斗实为歼敌模范战例，即使歼敌一营一排，也值得发扬。军区并号召全区军民继续努力，创造更多的歼敌范例。
    【本报长治二十八日电】太行新华日报豫北前线记者高一帆二十七日水冶电称：我在水冶八路军×指挥部中听到中央社广播称：蒋军正在水冶六河沟与共军激战。我现驻在安静的水冶城内，并未听到任何枪声。只见成队八路军及民兵高唱战歌，开赴前线，围困被蒋军侵占的曲沟等地。水冶城内一千五百家商号照常营业，各工厂昼夜开工，农民秋禾大部收割完竣，成群农民担着棉花、粮食及菜蔬供应城市，每日上市棉花达五万斤。水冶警戒森严，秩序良好，屹立于蒋军野炮射程内，为一不可逾越之城。
