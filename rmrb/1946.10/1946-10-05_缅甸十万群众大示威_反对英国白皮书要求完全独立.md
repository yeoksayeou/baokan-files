　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: According to a United Press report from Rangoon: On September 29th, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma launched the largest mass demonstration in Burmese history to oppose the British White Paper on Burma published last May (Note: This White Paper vaguely allows Burma to enter the electoral conference, whose members may be invited to discuss a constitution suitable for Burma). Approximately 100,000 Burmese people marched in the major streets of Rangoon, holding red flags and shouting slogans such as "Tear up the White Paper, accept the workers' demands, we want complete freedom." Aung San, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist League, at a recent meeting, urged the people to continue to adhere to a firm position in striving for national demands, and called on all parties to give support. The meeting passed several resolutions supporting the demands of the strikers, urging the withdrawal of the Defense Act and the release of innocent people convicted under the law, and for the new government to obtain more financial power from the British government.

    【新华社延安二日电】据合众社仰光讯：九月二十九日，缅甸反法西斯人民自由联盟发动缅甸有史以来最大之群众示威游行，以反对英国于去年五月所发表之对缅白皮书（按：该白皮书只含糊允许缅入选举会议，其议员得被邀商定一种适于缅甸之宪法）。约十万之缅甸人民，列队在仰光各大街道游行，手执红色旗帜，高呼“撕毁白皮书，接受工人要求，我们要完全自由”等口号。反法西斯联盟主席安山在最近一次会议中，力促人民继续坚持争取民族要求之坚定立场，并呼吁各方给予支持。该次会议通过若干决议，支持罢工者之要求，力促撤回国防法及释放根据该法判罪之无辜人民，并以新政府自英政府中取得更多之财政权。
