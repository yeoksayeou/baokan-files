　　Farmers Have High Enthusiasm for Production with Land
    Yanshan Village Achieves "One-Third Surplus After Farming"
    Military Family Writes to Son: "Fight Well and Defend Our Good Life!"
    [This newspaper Yangcheng 30th dispatch] After the rent and interest reduction of last year and the liquidation movement of this year, Yanshan Village in Yangcheng has thoroughly realized "land to the tiller," and the masses' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. This year, under the organization and leadership of labor hero Shangguan Zhongyou, "labor mutual aid leads to wealth," and this autumn is an unprecedented bumper harvest. The entire village has achieved "one-third surplus after farming." The village has 3,549 mu of land, and it can harvest 6,756 shi of autumn grain (excluding hemp, sesame, vegetables, and other miscellaneous fields). After paying the public grain, at least 6,000 shi of grain will be left. With a total population of 1,234 in the village, calculated at 3 dou per person per month, it is enough for 16 months of consumption with a surplus. The output has increased by about one-third compared to last year, truly achieving "one-third surplus after farming." None of the 316 households in the village lacks food. The Shangguan Tingkui mutual aid team, consisting of 23 households, has 4 households that have achieved "one-third surplus after farming." The rest have either "one-fifth surplus after farming" or "one-third surplus after farming." Only the Shangguan Xuanfu household is relatively poor, but it has also changed from extreme poverty to having enough to eat. A few days ago, military family member Shangguan Fa wrote to his son: "Before you joined the army, our father and son could not farm six or seven mu of land well, and we had nothing to eat in the autumn; this year, we have been liberated and recovered seven mu of land. My mother, your wife, and I are all in the mutual aid group, and everyone is helping us. We harvested three shi of wheat in the summer, and we can harvest at least sixteen or seventeen large shi of grain in the autumn (equivalent to twenty-two or twenty-three shi by official standards), which is enough for our family of three to eat for two years. We can also pick more than 20 jin of cotton." He finally instructed his son: "Fight well on the front lines and defend our good life!" Shangguan Haijin is a "half-baked" carpenter. His family of three has thirteen mu of land, and this year he got two or three more mu. He is unwilling to join the mutual aid group, but is willing to farm when he is busy and do carpentry work when he is idle, "preferring to earn cash immediately rather than unseen benefits." As a result, he harvested eight shi less grain. The millet of those who joined the mutual aid group has entered the granary, while his millet is still growing in the field. His family of three is too busy to manage it all. There are only five or six such households in Yanshan, and they all regret that they refused to join the mutual aid group. The movement of "land to the tiller" and organized mutual aid production has brought warmth and satiety to the masses, as well as a continuously increasing enthusiasm for production. Before the autumn harvest is over, the masses are already making plans for next year: "Last autumn, we only cared about earning "cash immediately" (transportation) and forgot about "unseen benefits" (agriculture). The dams were not built well, and the manure was not piled well. This year, our mutual aid group will transfer some people to transport goods and leave some people to build dams, dig black grass, and make manure. We will prepare for two years' worth of crops in one year, and we will harvest even more grain next year." The mutual aid brigade has also made preparations and plans to process the land after the autumn harvest in order to lay a more solid foundation for agricultural production next year.

　　农民有土地生产热情高
    岩山村达到耕三余一
    军属给儿子写信：“要好好打仗，保卫咱这好光景！”
    【本报阳城三十日电】阳城岩山村经过去年的减租减息和今年的清算运动，彻底实现了耕者有其田，群众生产情绪空前高涨。今年在劳动英雄上官中有组织领导下，“劳动互助、发财致富”，今秋为历来罕见的丰收，全村已达到了耕三余一。全村土地三千五百四十九亩，共可收秋粮六千七百五十六石（大麻、芝麻、菜等杂田未计）。缴完公粮，至少可余六千石以上的粮食。以全村一千二百三十四口人，每人每月三斗计，足供十六个月吃用尚有余。比去年产量提高约三分之一，真正做到了耕三余一。全村三百一十六户，已没有一户不够吃的。上官廷魁互助分队二十三户，有四户做到了“耕三余一”。其余有的“耕二余一”，有的“耕三余一”。只有上官轩富一户较差，也由赤贫变成了够吃户。军属上官法前几天给他儿子的信中写道：“从前你没参军时，咱父子俩种六、七亩地也种不好，秋天没吃的；今年咱翻了身，收回七亩地，我和你妈、你媳妇都在互助组，大家都帮助咱，夏天打了三石麦，秋季最少也能打十六、七大石粮食（合官石廿二、三石）足够咱三口人二年吃。还能摘廿多斤花”。他最后嘱咐儿子说：“好好在前方打仗，保卫咱这好光景吧！”上官海金是个“半把手”木匠，三口人，种着十三亩地，今年又得到二三亩，他不愿意参加互助组，却愿意自己忙时种地，闲时做工匠活，“宁赚现过现，不赚眼不见”，结果少打了八石粮食。参加互助组的谷子进了仓，他的谷子还在地里长着。三口人忙也忙不过来。这样的人，在岩山只有五六户现在都后悔自己不该拒绝参加互助。耕者有其田和组织起来互助生产的运动，群众带来了饱暖，也带来了不断提高生产的热情。秋收尚未结束，群众就作了明年的打算：“去年秋后咱们只顾赚“现过现”（运输）把“眼不见”（农业）忘了，堰没垒好，粪没堆好，今年咱互助组要抽调些人运输，留下些人垒堰、刨黑草、闹粪土，一年庄稼二年做，明年的粮食就收得更多”。互助大队也已作了准备，计划秋收后实行土地加工，以便给明年的农业生产打下更坚实的基础。
