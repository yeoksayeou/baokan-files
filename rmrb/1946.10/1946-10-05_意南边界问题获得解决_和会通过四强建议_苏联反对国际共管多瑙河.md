Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Paris dispatch: Regarding the Italian-Yugoslav border issue, the Italian Political Committee of the Peace Conference voted on the 28th to pass the "French Line" of the Four-Power recommendation. This line is a compromise between the Soviet and Anglo-American proposed lines. It allocates approximately three-quarters of the Istrian Peninsula to Yugoslavia, and the remainder to Italy (excluding the Free Territory of Trieste). This issue has been hotly debated at the Peace Conference. When the final vote was taken, the four powers took a consistent position.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Paris dispatch: The Economic Committee for Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland of the Peace Conference met twice on the 30th to discuss the Danube River issue (in reality, an attempt by the U.S. and Britain to interfere in the Danube River issue). U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' advisor, Vandenberg, spoke, presenting the joint Anglo-American proposal for international control of Danube River navigation. He also advocated convening a conference of Danube River basin countries within six months, with the participation of the U.S., Britain, and France (note that these three countries are not Danube River basin countries), to establish a permanent international system. Soviet representative Gusev refuted Vandenberg's proposal, arguing that Danube River navigation matters should be decided only by countries related to the river, and countries unrelated to the Danube River should not formulate navigation regulations for it. Gusev asked: Can the United States accept the principle that the navigation system for the St. Lawrence River, on the U.S.-Canada border, should not be formulated with the participation of the countries concerned? During the debate, representatives from Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland supported the Soviet position, while representatives from Britain, France, and Belgium supported the American opinion. In the final vote, the committee passed a French proposal that closely resembled the American opinion, with eight votes in favor and five votes against (including the Soviet Union). The Military Committee of the Peace Conference also met on the 30th, completing all the military clauses of the Hungarian Peace Treaty in one hour and the military clauses of the Finnish Peace Treaty in five minutes. The work of the Military Committee has essentially concluded. However, it will still hold a meeting on the 1st to discuss any possible amendments that may be proposed.

　　意南边界问题获得解决
    和会通过四强建议
    苏联反对国际共管多瑙河
    【新华社延安一日电】巴黎讯：关于意南边界问题，和会之意大利政治委员会已于二十八日进行表决，通过四强建议之“法国建议线”，该建议线是过去苏联建议线与美英建议线的折衷界线，它将伊斯特利亚半岛约四分之三的领地划与南斯拉夫，  将其余的划与意大利（的里雅斯特自由区除外）。这一问题在和会上曾争执良久，当最后投票时，四强所采取的立场是一致的。
    【新华社延安二日电】巴黎讯：和会之罗、保、匈、芬经济委员会于三十日开会两次，讨论多瑙河问题（实际上是美英企图插足多瑙河问题），美国务卿贝纳斯的顾问范登堡发言时，提出英美关于国际管制多瑙河航运之联合建议，并主张在六个月内召集多瑙河流域各国会议，美英法（按此三国并非多瑙河流域国家）亦参加，以建立永久性的国际制度。苏联代表古赛夫反驳范登堡之主张，认为多瑙河通航事宜，应仅由与该河有关之国家决定之，而与多瑙河无关之国家，不能为其制定航运制度事。古氏发问称：美国是否能接受此种原则，即对于美加边界的圣劳伦斯河不是与该有关之国家可以参加制定之航运制度呢？辩论时，南、捷、波代表赞成苏方主张，而英、法、比代表则支持美国的意见。最后表决时委员会过过了近乎美国意见的法国建议，赞成者八票，反对者五票（包括苏联）。和会之军事委员会亦于三十日集会，在一小时内完成对匈和约中之全部军事条款，并于五分钟内完成对芬和约中之军事条款，军事委员会之工作至此实际上已告完毕，然仍将于一日举行会议，以便讨论可能提出之任何修正案。
