Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Celebrities from all circles in Yan'an gathered to launch a "U.S. Troops Get Out of China" Movement Week, responding to the "Demand U.S. Troops Get Out of China Movement" initiated by all circles in Shanghai. The meeting was initiated by Xie Juezai, Xu Fanting, Li Dingming, Li Furen, Cui Tianfu, Ke Zhongping, Ma Jichuan, Bi Guangdou, and others. It was held at 10:00 AM yesterday in the conference hall of the Foreign Affairs Office, with more than 60 respected elders and celebrities attending.

　　Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered an impromptu speech saying: "Why does the Kuomintang have the audacity to fight a civil war? It is because of the help of the American imperialists. The American imperialists have made up their minds to turn China into their colony. The current movement in various parts of the United States and Shanghai demanding the withdrawal of American troops is a life-saving movement for China. We must resolutely respond to and organize the promotion of this movement."

　　Comrade Liao Chengzhi, who had just returned to Yan'an from Nanjing, spoke about the atrocities committed by U.S. troops in China that he had seen in the Nanjing and Shanghai area. He said, "Now the people of the whole country have seen through the true face of the U.S. government's reactionary policy towards China."

　　Li Dingming, Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government, said: "The Chinese people must not be dead; we are determined to oppose dictatorship and national betrayal. The Chinese Liberated Areas are the pillar of China's peace and democracy, and this pillar cannot be shaken." General Fan Longzhang, Commander of the First Army of the Democratic National Construction Army, said: "The purpose of our army's uprising is to oppose the civil war and demand peace, democracy, and independence. We will not stop until we achieve our goal." Qian Laisu, a member of the Tongmenghui, Wu Manyou, a labor hero, and Xu Teli, a 73-year-old veteran educator, also spoke successively, unanimously expressing: "The current world is the world of the people; it is no longer the fascist world of the past. We China must realize independence, democracy, and peace. Whoever tries to stop us, we will fight them to the end."

　　After the speeches, the following proposals were adopted: (1) Yan'an's response to the U.S. Troops Get Out of China Movement Week agenda; (2) In order to better coordinate and connect various aspects of the movement, a working committee for the Movement Week will be established, with Xie Juezai elected as director and Li Furen and Li Zhuoran as deputy directors, with a number of committee members; (3) The working committee will hire specialists to draft four drafts of telegrams to be sent to American democratic groups, U.S. President Truman (the working committee will invite groups from various liberated areas to co-sign), the United Nations Security Council, and Shanghai people's organizations, accusing the stationing of U.S. troops in China of endangering peace in the Far East and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
