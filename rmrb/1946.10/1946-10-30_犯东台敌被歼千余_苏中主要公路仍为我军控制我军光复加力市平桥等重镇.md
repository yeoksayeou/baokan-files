Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 26th: Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops began their northward invasion from Haian towards Dongtai on the 13th, they have suffered 1,400 casualties up to the 21st. The 65th Division (formerly a military unit) of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, advancing from south to north along the Fu'an-Dongtai line, sustained heavy losses and retreated to the Haian-Jiajiaji line. They reinforced their forces by transferring the 63rd Brigade (formerly the 61st Division of the 100th Army) to continue the attack. Furthermore, the 57th Regiment (formerly a division) of the 19th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek troops was dispatched from Zitong and advanced towards Shiyan (more than 30 li southwest of Dongtai) on the 21st. A portion of the 56th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek troops was transferred from the Hai'an-Taizhou line to jointly attack Anfeng. The aforementioned three groups of Chiang Kai-shek troops totaled approximately eight regiments, numbering over 14,000 men. Currently, the New Fourth Army in Dongtai is engaged in combat with the Chiang Kai-shek troops along the Liangduo line, 20 li south of Dongtai.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: The military and civilians in Central Jiangsu have extensively launched a self-defense demolition war, causing immense difficulties for the Chiang Kai-shek troops in terms of transportation and resupply. The major highways crisscrossing Central Jiangsu, including the Tonghai (Nantong-Haian), HaiTai (Haian-Taizhou), and RuTai (Rugao-Taixing) lines, remain largely under the control of the liberated area's military and civilians, except for a few strongholds occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. On the same night that the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded Huangqiao for the third time on September 26th, the local militia and guerrillas completely destroyed the Huangtai Highway within two hours, and the Huangqiao-Rugao Highway was also largely controlled by the New Fourth Army. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded Linzi and Dingyan again on September 19th, the local military and civilians continuously harvested power lines, destroyed roadbeds, and attacked the invading and road-repairing Chiang Kai-shek troops. In the four days from September 20th to 23rd alone, they fought eight battles. In the battle of Lujialin Zitou, an entire platoon of Chiang Kai-shek troops was wiped out. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Haian launched four southward attacks in three days from September 23rd to 25th, all of which were repelled.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: While the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded Dongtai, their rear forces were weakened. Our military and civilians seized the opportunity to launch attacks and achieved successive victories. After a certain unit of the New Fourth Army, in coordination with the militia, captured Sishui Town on the Yunhe Line on the 15th, they also recovered the key towns of Pingqiao and Huangpu between Huai'an and Baoying on the 20th, isolating the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Baoying. After successively removing the Chiang Kai-shek strongholds such as Hetouzhuang, Shijiabao, Jiangjiadian on the Tai(xing)Huang(qiao) Highway and Xiejia Dian on the Ru(gao)Huang(qiao) Highway, they also recovered Jiali City, a key town southwest of Rugao, on the 18th. Currently, the entire transportation line of more than 200 li from Taixing to Rugao, except for Huangqiao, has been completely liberated.

    苏中主要公路仍为我军控制我军光复加力市平桥等重镇
    【新华社华中二十六日电】十三日起自海安北犯东台蒋军，迄二十一日止已被歼一千四百名。自南向北沿富（安）东（台）线进犯蒋军六十五师（原军），受重创后，退守海安至贾家集一线增调六十三旅（原一百军六十一师）继续进攻，复由溱潼抽调蒋军十九旅（原师）五十七团于二十一曾向时堰（东台西南三十余里）方向进犯，由海（安）泰（州）线抽调蒋军十九旅五十六团一部，会犯安丰。上述三路蒋军共约八个团，一万四千余人。现东台新四军正与蒋军在东台南二十里之梁垛一线对战中。
    【新华社华中二十七日电】苏中军民广泛展开自卫破击战，蒋军的交通补充已感到万分困难。纵横苏中的通（南通）海（安）、海（安）泰（州）、如（皋）泰（兴）各主要公路线蒋军，除侵踞若干据点外，大部仍控制在解放区军民手中。九月二十六日，蒋军第三次侵占黄桥的当天晚上，该地民兵游击队在两小时内将黄泰公路全部破坏，黄桥至如皋公路亦大部被控制在新四军手中。蒋军于九月十九日再度侵犯林梓、丁堰后，当地军民即不断收割电线，破坏路基，打击出犯与修路蒋军。仅九月二十至二十三日四天中，即作战八次。陆家林子头一战，蒋军一排全部被歼。海安蒋军于九月二十三至二十五三天中南犯四次，均被击退。
    【新华社华中二十七日电】蒋军侵占东台，后方兵力空虚，我军民乘隙出击，连获胜利，运河线上新四军某部配合民兵于十五日攻克汜水镇后，二十日又收复淮安宝应间之平桥、黄浦两重镇，宝应蒋军已陷孤立。在苏中经先后拔除泰（兴）黄（桥）公路上之河头庄、石家堡、姜家店及如（皋）黄（桥）公路上之谢家甸等蒋军据点之后，十八日又收复如皋西南之重镇加力市。现泰兴至如皋二百余华里之交通线除黄桥外已全部重获解放。
