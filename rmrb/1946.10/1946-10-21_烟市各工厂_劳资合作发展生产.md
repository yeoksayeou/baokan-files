　　Labor-Capital Cooperation to Develop Production
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 15th] In Yantai, factories are seeing close labor-capital cooperation to develop national industry. At the Tongshun Cigarette Factory, over one hundred male and female workers have voluntarily increased their working hours by one and a half hours each day since September. Daily cigarette production has increased from twelve boxes to eighteen boxes. The workers said, "If we put in more effort, the factory's income will increase, business will develop, and our lives will improve even more." The factory manager was deeply moved and immediately gave up four exquisite large living rooms to the workers to establish a study room. Large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were hung, tens of thousands of yuan were allocated to rush-produce twenty sets of desks and chairs, and textbooks and stationery such as pencils were purchased and distributed to the workers.

　　烟市各工厂
    劳资合作发展生产
    【新华社烟台十五日电】烟市各工厂劳资亲密合作，发展民族工业。同顺烟厂男女工人百余名，自九月份开始，每日自动增加工作时间一小时半。每天香烟产量由十二箱提高到十八箱。工人们说：“我们多出力使厂方收入增多，营业发展，我们生活也就更加改善。”该厂经理极为感动，即将四间房的精致大客厅让给工人建立学习室。悬挂毛主席、朱总司令巨像，拨数万元赶制二十套桌椅，并买了课本和铅笔等文具发给工人。
