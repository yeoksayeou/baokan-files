　　【Linzhang News from Our Newspaper】For more than three months since the land reform work team arrived in the Third District of Linzhang, although more than 20 villages have made breakthroughs and realized "land to the tiller," the movement has not been carried out quickly and deeply enough. The main reason for this is that the leadership is constrained and does not dare to let go boldly. As soon as the struggle becomes a bit sharp, they shout, "It's too far left!" When activists and some of the masses rise up to struggle, they say, "There are too few people, and they are not mature enough," hoping that one movement will mobilize 80 percent of the peasants. The leadership does not dare to explicitly propose to the masses the realization of "land to the tiller;" they only unilaterally emphasize anti-traitors and anti-local bullies, and do not understand that most of the traitors and local bullies in Linzhang are inseparable from the landlords. If they are not arrested and allowed to carry out secret activities below, threatening the masses, the movement cannot be deepened. The masses have many concerns, but their fear of the pseudo-bandit Guo Qing and the "change of regime" is not as great as their fear of the direct harm of the landlords and local bullies in their own villages.

    Therefore, the leadership's complete and bold unleashing has become an urgent issue in the current movement. It is necessary to support the masses from top to bottom, resolutely arrest traitors, puppets, and local bullies, so that the masses' righteousness can be uplifted, and the realization of land to the tiller can be quickly realized, the border areas can be consolidated, and self-defense forces can be strengthened.

　　临漳三区群运停滞急待放手为民撑腰
    【本报临漳讯】翻身队到达临漳三区的三个多月中，虽已有二十余村打开局面，实现了“耕者有其田”，但运动进行的不够迅速和深入。这主要原因在于领导上束手束脚不敢大胆放手。斗争稍一尖锐就喊着：“过左”了！积极分子与部分群众起来要斗争，说：“人太少、不成熟”，希望一个运动就发动到百分之八十的农民。领导上不敢明确的向群众提出实现“耕者有其田”；光片面强调反奸、反恶霸，不了解临漳的汉奸、恶霸绝大部分与地主不可分，如不将其逮捕，听其在下面秘密活动，威胁群众，运动就不能深入下去。群众顾虑固多，但怕伪匪郭清，怕“变天”，均不如怕本村地主恶霸对他们的直接危害。
    因此领导上彻底大胆放手，即成为当前运动的迫切问题，必需从上而下给群众撑腰，坚决逮捕奸伪恶霸，使群众的正气抬头，才能迅速实现耕者有其田，巩固边沿区，增强自卫力量。
