　　Fierce Fighting Around Jiaozuo
    Main Force of Invading Army Intercepted by Our Forces
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 13th] Chiang Kai-shek, determined to completely break the peace agreement, began a fierce attack on Jiaozuo on the morning of the 11th, as reported previously. By the morning of the 12th, the entire 32nd Division, supported by an artillery regiment and two tank companies (20 tanks), advanced westward along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway from Xiuwu towards Zhanggongpu and Daiwangzhen. They were bravely resisted by our soldiers and civilians along the way, and fierce fighting continued in areas around Zhanggongpu, Wolonggang, and Zhangzhuang (about 30 *li* from Jiaozuo). In the south, the entire 110th Brigade of the 85th Division attempted to outflank and harass Jiaozuo from the south via Xuying and Muladian in Wuzhi County. They are now being intercepted by our defending troops in areas around Lanxie Bridge and Yanggaozhen (about 20 *li* west of Wuzhi and 30 *li* southeast of Jiaozuo). In the north, the 177th Brigade of the 38th Division, attempting to outflank Jiaozuo from Huixian County, is still being held up in the Baobi area (50 *li* west of Huixian and 70 *li* northeast of Jiaozuo). Although the Chiang army's artillery fire is extremely fierce, and they have the support of aircraft and tanks, after a day and a night, they are still being blocked near their starting positions.
