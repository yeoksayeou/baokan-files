　　The Past and Present of Shuicun
    Chickens and Pigs Died Out When Chiang's Troops Were Here, Now Everyone Eats Well and Dresses Warmly
    [Our newspaper Yangcheng 23rd dispatch] Shuicun, in the first district of the Yangcheng New Area, after the struggle for liberation and the initial realization of "land to the tiller," has already achieved eating well and dressing warmly with the first autumn harvest. The entire village of 310 households, with 1,253 people, harvested 1,215 shi of wheat this summer, averaging about 1 shi per person. The autumn harvest of millet, corn, and miscellaneous grains amounted to 2,716 shi. The harvest of indigo and vegetables was worth 102 shi of rice, averaging 2 shi and 2.5 dou per person. The summer and autumn harvests together average more than 3 shi and 2 dou per person. Not only is there enough food for the whole village, but more than half of the people have surplus grain. In addition, the whole village earned 2,445 jin of cotton, averaging 2 jin per person, enough to weave 1.5 jin of cloth, which is also enough to clothe themselves. According to Liang @Lu's investigation, those who changed into new clothes for the season accounted for 45 percent. In the past, the village's chickens and pigs were killed off by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Now, the two *lu* in this village alone raise 67 pigs, 83 ducks, and more than 100 chickens. The lives of the masses have greatly improved. Guiying and his daughter-in-law used to wear "oiled skirts" and expose their skin. After liberation and obtaining land, this year's harvest will leave them with enough grain for two years, and they have two single and one cotton new clothes. He hung a portrait of Chairman Mao in his room and said, "This good time is all thanks to Chairman Mao!" Zhang Fengqi, who suffered poverty for 53 years, made a cotton coat from the single garment left by his father when he died and wore it for more than ten years until it was tattered. This year, he has replaced it with new robes inside and out. Cui Deji, a poor military family member in Guo Village, his family of four added sixteen new single garments, six new quilts, and new cotton clothes inside and out this year. Middle peasant Zhao Xin happily said: "The Japanese occupied us for five years, and there wasn't a single year with a good harvest. This year, we harvested eight *lao shi* of grain, and our family of six can't finish eating it." The reasons why the village achieved eating well and dressing warmly are: (1) Through land reform, peasants obtained land. Farmer Zhang Ge said: "In the past, after working for a year, we couldn't even get a pile of chaff when threshing. The landlords seemed to divide the spoils like five ghosts tearing apart a corpse, taking it all away." In the past, 204 of the village's 310 households were tenant farmers. Only two households in Wozhuang did not rent land. Now, 98 percent have become masters of their own land. Li Xiaohong, who did not dare to rent land in the past and relied on a carrying pole to feed three people, also obtained the fruits of the mass movement and bought five mu of land. (2) After obtaining land, the peasants immediately organized themselves to engage in mutual aid production. All 230 male and female full and half laborers in the village have participated in mutual aid groups, actively engaged in production, and generally achieved more work and more manure. @Lu Geng, an elderly man, applied 60 loads of manure per mu. (3) The government issued 110,000 yuan in agricultural loans, helping 67 liberated peasants add 20 head of livestock and 194 pieces of farm tools, greatly increasing productivity.
    [Our newspaper dispatch] The masses in the Tinanbao district of the second district of Handan, are engaged in autumn planting on their newly reclaimed and beloved land with unprecedented enthusiasm this autumn. In the eleven villages in the entire district, the wheat cultivated area this autumn increased by 64 percent compared to last year (last year was 3659.4 mu). People carry plows and drive livestock to the fields at the second crow of the rooster. The peasants say happily: "Now it's really worthwhile to work! Because the land is our own." Villages have gathered shares to buy livestock, re-plowing 834.9 mu of barren land that has not been plowed for many years. Before sowing, the peasants also picked many grass roots and applied 3,600 carts of fertilizer to 6,000 mu of wheat land, more than twice as much as in previous years. Now, the masses are actively cutting grass for bedding, cleaning the street soil, etc., and rushing to make fertilizer so that all wheat seedlings can be fertilized once before winter. (Gen Liu)

　　水村今昔
    蒋军在时鸡猪断种今日人人吃饱穿暖
    【本报阳城廿三日电】阳城新区一区水村，经过翻身斗争初步实现了耕者有其田后，第一个秋收已做到吃饱穿暖。全村三百一十户，一千二百五十三口，今夏收麦一千二百一十五石，每人平均约一石。秋收谷、玉茭及杂粮二千七百一十六石，收蓝收菜值米一百零二石，每人平均二石二斗五升，夏秋合计每人三石二斗多。不仅全村够吃，且半数以上还有余粮。另外，全村收入棉花二千四百四十五斤，平均每人二斤，可织布一斤半，也够穿衣自给。据梁＠闾调查，换季穿新衣的已占百分之四十五。过去该村曾被蒋家队伍杀得鸡猪不留，现在光本村两闾即养猪六十七个，鸭八十三个，鸡一百余个，群众生活大为改善。贵英和他媳妇过去“搭油裙”，露皮肉，翻身获得土地后，今年收获除吃一年外还可余一年粮，衣服是两单一棉三表新。他把毛主席像端挂在房内，说：“这时光都是毛主席给咱的呵！”受穷五十三年的张凤歧，把父亲死时丢下的单衣做成棉衣，一连穿了十几年，已破烂不堪了，今年都换成了里外新的袍子。郭庄贫苦军属崔得记，全家四口，今年添了十六件新单衣，六条新被子，棉衣也是里外新。中农赵新愉快的说：“日本占了五年，没有一年收成好，今年收粮八老石，全家六口吃不完。”该村做到吃饱穿暖的原因：（一）经过土地改革，农民获得土地。农民张革说：“过去劳动一年，打场时连堆糠也分不下，地主好像五鬼分尸一样全给拿走了。”过去该村三百一十户中即有佃户二百零四户，卧庄仅两户不租地，现在百分之九十八已成为自己土地的主人了。过去不敢租种土地，靠一条扁担顾三口的李小红，也在群运中获得果实，买了五亩地。（二）农民获得土地后，立即组织起来生产互助。全村二百卅个男女全半劳力，都已参加互助组，积极生产，普遍做到工到粪多梁。＠闾更老汉每亩上大粪六十担。（三）政府发了十一万元农贷，帮助六十七家翻身农民添置了二十头牲口，和一百九十四件农具，生产力大为提高。
    【本报讯】邯郸二区堤南堡小区群众，今秋以空前的热情，在新收回的自己心爱的土地上从事秋种。全小区十一个村，今秋小麦耕地面积比去年增加了百分之六十四（去年为三六五九·四亩）。鸡叫两遍人们就扛着犁耧、赶着牲口往地里去，农民们喜洋洋的说：“如今干活可红哩！因为地已是自己的了”。村中纷纷集股买牲口，使久年未犁的八三四·九亩熟荒重新翻起。农民们在下种前还拣了许多草根，在六千亩麦地上，施肥三千六百车，超过往年二倍。现在群众正积极割草垫圈，打扫街土等，赶制肥料，以便冬前将所有的麦苗施肥一次。（根六）
