　　Taihang Suffers Minor Frost Damage
    Overall Autumn Harvest in the Region Still Reaches 70%
    Special Crops Such as Indigo and Cotton Have Good Yields
    [Report from our Changzhi correspondent on the 4th] Although some areas of the Taihang region suffered frost damage, resulting in a loss of approximately five million *shi* (calculated using the market *dou*) of grain, the region as a whole still achieved an average harvest of 70%, with a total yield of 18.2 million *shi* of coarse grains. Considering the region's population of five million, the average grain availability per person is more than three *shi*. Among the autumn crops, 150,000 *mu* were planted with Zhong, Golden Queen, and Yujiao corn varieties. Due to frost damage, losses were quite significant, with the Second District alone experiencing a reduction of about 30% in yield. However, the region as a whole can still harvest 300,000 *shi*.

    In terms of special crops, this year's harvests have been good across the board. The region planted a total of over 1.1 million *mu* of cotton (originally planned for 1.04 million *mu*), with an average yield of 30 *jin* (market weight) of clean cotton per *mu*, resulting in a total yield of over 3.3 million *jin*. Considering the region's population of five million, the average availability per person is six *jin*, which is sufficient for self-sufficiency. Planting one *mu* of cotton is equivalent to planting three *mu* of autumn grain. The region planted over 5,000 *mu* of indigo, with an average yield of 120 *jin* of indigo per *mu*, resulting in a total yield of 600,000 *jin* of indigo. Several counties and districts have already achieved self-sufficiency. Planting one *mu* of indigo is equivalent to planting seven *mu* of autumn grain. In Changzhi county alone, 23,000 *mu* of hemp were planted, with a yield of 70-80 *jin* per *mu*, which is equivalent to planting seven to eight *mu* of autumn grain.

    The region has a total of 17 million *mu* of land, with 5 million *mu* planted with autumn wheat, including 30,000 *mu* of 169 wheat. Autumn cultivation in old liberated areas can reach 80%, while new liberated areas are striving for 70%.

　　太行小受风霜
    全区秋收仍获七成
    靛棉等特种作物收成均佳
    【本报长治四日电】太行区虽部分地区遭受风霜之灾，损失粮食约五百万石（以市斗计），但全区平均仍有七成年景，共可收粗粮一千八百二十万石。以全区五百万人口计，每人可平均粮食三石多。秋禾中、金皇后玉茭共播种十五万亩，因风霜损失颇大，仅二分区约减收三成，但全区尚可收三十万石。
    在特种作物方面，今年收获均佳。全区共植棉一百一十余万亩（原计划一百零四万亩），每亩平均可收净花三十斤（市秤），可收三百三十多万斤，以全区五百万人口计，每人平均六斤，足可自给。种花一亩平均可顶种秋禾三亩。全区种靛五千余亩，每亩平均可打靛一百二十斤，共可打靛六十万斤，若干县区已可自给。种靛一亩可顶种秋禾七亩。麻仅长治一县即种两万三千亩，每亩下七八十斤，可顶种秋禾七、八亩。
    全区土地一千七百万亩，种秋麦五百万亩，其中一六九小麦三万亩。秋耕老区可达百分之八十，新区争取百分之七十。
