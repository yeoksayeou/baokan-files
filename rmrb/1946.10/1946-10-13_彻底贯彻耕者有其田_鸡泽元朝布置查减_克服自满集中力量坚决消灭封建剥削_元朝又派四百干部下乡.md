[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 11th Dispatch] In order to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller," the rent investigation and reduction movement in the old liberated areas of southern Hebei is about to be universally launched. The Jize County Party Committee recently held an expanded meeting of cadres, conducting another comprehensive review of the land reform in the county. The meeting assessed the achievements of past mass movements, analyzed the current class situation in the countryside, and found that many despotic landlords were using tricks such as family separation, fake pawns, fake sales, selling bad land, and pawning good land to conceal much of the land they had plundered from the peasants. They were also secretly buying off peasant leaders and village-level cadres, provoking internal struggles among the peasants, and plotting a restoration. A few comrades had become complacent, failing to see that "land to the tiller" was only a preliminary achievement and had not been thoroughly implemented. They also failed to see that many peasants had not yet been thoroughly emancipated, and were becoming entangled in internal disputes caused by the distribution of fruits of victory, giving the despots a loophole to counterattack and sabotage. In order to change this situation and deepen the mass movement, the meeting unanimously decided: 1. To thoroughly eliminate feudal exploitation, launch another comprehensive investigation of land reform throughout the county, and continue to mobilize the masses for liquidation struggles, so that feudal reactionary forces can never carry out a counterattack again. It called on the peasants to unite and thoroughly emancipate themselves, avenging centuries of grievances all at once. 2. To absorb the broad masses of middle peasants into the struggle and organize all the peasants. 3. Party, government, mass organizations, and the military should separately convene meetings of village cadres, activists, and various leaders and heroes, concentrate efforts to unify thinking, and launch a major offensive against feudal forces. 4. To boldly let go and call on cadres to be models and heroes in leading the masses to emancipate themselves. To maintain a firm stance and never be deceived or bought off by landlords.
    Yuanchao recently convened a county-wide cadre meeting to deploy the launch of the rent investigation and reduction movement. The county is an old liberated area, and the masses have been initially mobilized, but it is still very insufficient. In villages where mobilization has been better, the peasants' land problems have been largely resolved, but in some villages, landlords still maintain a dominant position. In the border areas (Districts 2 and 4), there is still a strong feudal force that continues to oppress the masses. In order to deeply mobilize the masses, the meeting decided that in addition to the original land reform teams, more than 400 cadres should be organized to participate in the movement. In each district, in addition to Party, government, mass organizations, and military cadres, some teachers and students from stores, cooperatives, high schools, and central primary schools will also participate in this work. Before all the people went to the countryside, the county party committee emphasized: 1. Resolutely protect the interests of middle peasants and organize all middle peasants in the movement. And protect the newly risen rich peasants. 2. Resolutely and thoroughly eliminate feudal exploitation, eliminate extreme poverty, and achieve "land to the tiller." To support this movement, it also called on Party member cadres from landlord backgrounds to donate land. 3. Boldly mobilize and follow the mass line. 4. All departments must unite and concentrate efforts to complete this task. The cadres have now all gone to the countryside, and the movement will soon be launched.

　　彻底贯彻耕者有其田
    鸡泽元朝布置查减
    克服自满集中力量坚决消灭封建剥削
    元朝又派四百干部下乡
    【本报威县十一日电】为彻底实现“耕者有其田”，冀南老区的查减运动即将普遍展开。鸡泽县委日前召开干部扩大会，再次进行全县农民翻身大检查。大会估计了过去群运的成绩，分析了目前农村的阶级状况，发现还有许多恶霸地主以分家、假当、假卖、卖坏地、当好地等诡计隐匿着许多掠自农民的土地，并秘密收买农民领袖与村级干部，挑拨农民内部斗争，阴谋复辟。有少数同志存在着自满情绪，看不见耕者有其田仅是初步实现，并未贯彻。看不见还有许多农民没翻透身，而纠缠于果实分配所引起的内部纠纷，给恶霸以反攻破坏的空隙。为转变这一情况，深入群运，大会一致决定：一、要彻底消灭封建剥削，在全县展开再次的翻身大检查，继续发动群众清算斗争，使封建反动势力永远不能再进行反攻。号召农民团结起来翻透身，千古冤仇一齐雪。二、吸收广大中农参加斗争，把全体农民组织起来。三、党政民武分头召开村干部活动分子和各种领袖、英雄会议，集中力量统一思想，展开向封建势力大进军。四、大胆放手，号召干部做领导群众翻身的模范与英雄。坚定立场，绝不受地主欺骗收买。
    元朝最近召开全县干部会，布置开展查减运动。该县是老解放区，群众有了初步发动，但还很不充分，发动较好的村，农民土地问题大部解决，但有些村庄地主仍居统治地位。发动不好的村，恶霸地主威严尚未打垮。在边沿区（二、四区）还存在着雄厚的封建势力，继续压榨着群众。为深入发动群众，大会决定除原翻身队外，再组织四百余干部投入运动。各区除了党政民武干部，并有商店、合作社、高小和中心小学一部教员学生，也参加这一工作，在全体下乡前，县委强调指出：一、坚决保护中农利益，在运动中把中农全部组织起来。并要保护新升富农。二、坚决彻底消灭封建剥削，消灭赤贫，达到耕者有其田。为支持这一运动，并号召地主出身的党员干部献田。三、放手发动，走群众路线。四、各部门要团结一致，集中力量完成这一任务。干部现已全部下乡，运动不久即将展开。
