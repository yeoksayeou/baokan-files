　　Crowds of People
    ——A Quick Sketch of the Wuan Mule and Horse Fair
    Yu Jia
    The ninth month of the lunar calendar marks the first mule and horse fair in Wuan City since the people were liberated.
    Bright red national flags hung all over the street, gongs and drums played lively tunes, and inside the "Fair Command Post" on South Street, it was bustling with activity, as if a wedding was being held. Many shops had "hospitality tea and water" set up, the hospitality was truly considerate! Even signs pointing to the public restrooms were hung high. Several operas were being performed on various temple stages, and people crowded the streets to buy things. "Buy some material for our child!" "Buy some gaiters for our grandmother." People paid and grabbed their purchases as if they were抢 (robbery), then laughing and joking, they squeezed back into the crowd. Their faces were filled with the indescribable joy of liberation.
    Beneath the Drum Tower, people were packed like sardines. As the Yangko dance team approached, wives had their shoes squeezed off, and children had their hats knocked off. "They're here! They're here! Oh, they're here!" Militiamen with rifles cleared the way for the Yangko team. An older sister with a hairpin in her hair carried a red silk banner, followed by an old woman carrying a drum, and another older sister vigorously beat the drum "suo duo duo." Thirty or forty women twisted and turned, some dressed as soldiers, some as those who comforted them, and some as farmers. They were performing stories of supporting the front lines, singing all kinds of songs to defend the border region and protect peace. Another team was all boys dressed up, one with a piece of white dough stuck on his nose, like a foreigner. He had the words "Marshall" written on his back. Next to him was someone wearing a green serge military uniform with a hard felt hat on his head and the words "Chiang Kai-shek" on his back. They were acting out opposition to the civil war. And there were more…
    In the era of the Japanese invaders, only those who had committed "crimes" could enter the "County Yamen." Today, under the management of the democratic government, the yamen is open, and streams of people are pouring in. A mother, leading her child, squeezed to the door of the Civil Affairs Section, peeked inside, and whispered to her child, "Quietly, they are handling official business for our people!" A woman in her forties excitedly said to another woman who had just arrived, "I've really opened my eyes today, going to roam around the yamen!"

　　人山人海
    ——武安骡马大会速写
    羽  嘉
    阴历九月初，这是武安城垣人民翻身后的第一个骡马大会。
    红殷殷的国旗挂了一街，锣鼓在奏着响亮的曲子，南街上，“大会指挥处”里面闹哄哄的，仿佛是在办喜事，好些铺门前，设有“应酬茶水，招待得真周到呀，连公共厕所往那儿走的牌子，也挂得高高的，好几台戏在各个庙台上出演着，人们在街上拥挤着，买东西。“给咱孩儿买件料子吧！”“给咱姥姥买付腿带子。”像抢似的，匆匆地付了钱，拿上东西，便又说笑着挤进人群里去了，他们的脸上浮现着难以描画的翻身后的喜悦。
    鼓楼底下人们挤得水泄不通，秧歌队一走过来，老婆们有挤掉鞋的，小孩们有挤掉帽的。“来了！来了！哎呀，来了”！民兵拿着枪杆在秧歌队前面开着路。一个梳着簪的大嫂扛着一面红绸大旗，后面一个老太太背着个鼓，一个大嫂用劲地“嗦哆哆”擂着，三四十个妇女扭着，有的扮战士，有的扮慰劳他，有的扮庄稼汉，她们在表演支援前线的故事，唱着各种各样的保卫边区保卫和平的歌。另一队，全是男孩子们装的，有一个鼻子上粘了块白面团，像个外国人，他背上贴着“马歇尔”三字，走在他旁边的一个穿一套绿呢子军服，头上顶着硬谷帽，背后写着：“蒋介石”，这是在扮演反内战。还有……
    在日寇时代，只有犯了“法”，才走进去的“县衙门”，今天在民主政府管理下，衙门敞开着，一股股人流往里涌。一个母亲牵着孩子挤到民政科的房门口，把头往里探了探，小声地对孩子说：“悄悄地，人家在给咱百姓办公事咧！”一个四十来岁的大娘兴高采烈地对另一个刚来的大嫂说：“俺今天可开了眼啦，到衙门里去漫游咧！”
