　　Ink and Blood
   (Continued)
    By Ilya Ehrenburg, Translated by Wan Ge
    If our newspapers are at fault for having too little news about the United States, then many American newspapers are guilty of publishing too many false reports about the Soviet Union. Currently, the anti-Soviet movement being carried out by many extremely serious American newspapers is based on propagandistic and false news. Slanderers know that the blows do not have to be placed in editorials; many people do not even read editorials at all. Slander should be placed in news dispatches and highlighted with bold headlines on the front page.

    There is a myth about the objectivity of various American newspapers. The secret formula is this: publish ten anti-Soviet news items, then publish one pro-Soviet one, and the reader will then think you are fair and will therefore be alarmed by the insidiousness of the Russians. The average American likes peace, and I am deeply convinced that they truly want to be friendly with the Russians. They are convinced that they will not be affected by the lies of the press, that they are mature and capable of independent thinking. But in order to think, you must know the subject you are thinking about.

    Some Americans say that I overestimate the importance of newspapers. They use the example to prove it: most of the newspapers were against Roosevelt, but Roosevelt was ultimately re-elected. May I say it again? I firmly believe that the average American is not a fool who can be dismissed with articles. The average American saw Roosevelt's actions with his own eyes. In addition, Roosevelt was able to make his voice heard by everyone. But what means does the average American have to check the news reports about the actions of the Russians in Iran, in Northeast China, in the Balkans? Even if he wants to think independently, what he is thinking about is often just a pile of lies that the newspapers supply him with every day.

    The average American can wholeheartedly think about the news of Soviet tanks advancing towards Tehran; he may come to his own "independent" conclusion. But what he does not know is that Soviet tanks never advanced towards Tehran at all. However, rebuttals never have the same effect as the original report, and the power of slander lies in the fact that it always leaves a mark.

    Tehran is far away from here. Now that I am in America myself, I still read a lot of published news about me. For example, news spread that I was constantly accompanied by a "Soviet secret police agent" while traveling throughout the United States, but in fact I was accompanied by a representative of the U.S. State Department. He, according to these deceptive reporters, became a Soviet secret police agent.

    When talking about my trip across America, Time magazine declared: "This kind of interview freedom is something that American reporters in Moscow have always dreamed of and do not know what it is like." These words were published on page 70 of the June 10th issue of Time magazine. On page 30 of this magazine, I read news that an American reporter named John Fischer "returned to the United States after three months of unrestricted... observation in Ukraine." I don't know what kind of treatment Fischer dreamed of when he was in Russia. Perhaps he regretted not being accompanied on his trip. I am personally grateful for the State Department's care, especially because Mr. Nelson, who accompanied me, is a man of great culture and wit, and we have now become very good friends. But I cannot help but point out that Time magazine used my trip to cast a shadow on Russia.

    If American journalists traveled accompanied by representatives of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, American reporters would scream loudly that their freedom was being taken away. If a Soviet journalist is accompanied by a representative of the U.S. State Department, Time magazine would say that American journalists dare not dream of such freedom. I really don't understand this kind of logic, or rather, I'm afraid I understand it too clearly.

    When Americans ask me what is needed to improve our mutual relations, I answer: "The same yardstick." Readers should not think that I want to promote the metric system or the Celsius system. I have no intention of interfering in American internal affairs: if Americans like to measure in feet, if they like to say that water freezes at thirty-two degrees, that is their own business. However, in evaluating any action, the most important thing is to use the same yardstick. (To be continued)

　　墨水和鲜血
   （一续）
    爱伦堡作 万歌译
    如果我们的报纸罪在关于美国的消息太少了，那么许多美国报纸的罪状便是刊载了太多的对苏联作错误报导的消息，目下许多极端认真的美国报纸所进行着的反苏运动都是拿宣传性和虚假的消息作根据的。诽谤者知道打击不必放在社论中，许多人甚至根本不读社论的，诽谤应放在电讯中，可以在封面那页上用粗号字标题标出来。
    对于各种美国报纸的客观性存在着一个神话。那秘方是这样的：刊登十篇反苏的消息，然后登一篇亲苏的，于是读者便会以为你是公正的，并会因此是为俄国人的阴险而惊恐了。一般的美国人都喜欢和平，我已深深的相信他们真要和俄国人友好相处。他们确信他们不会感受报界的谎言，他们已很成熟，能独立思考的。但是为了思考，你必须知道你所思考着的题目。
    有些美国人说我把报纸的重要性估计得太高。他们用这例子来证明：大部分的报纸是反对罗斯福的，但罗斯福终获重选了，我愿再说一遍？我深信一般的美国人并非是笨伯，可以用文章来把他丢开的。一般的美国人亲眼看见了罗斯福的行为，此外，罗斯福也能使他的声音为大家听到，可是一般的美国人对于报导俄人在伊朗，在中国东北，在巴尔干的行为的消息，又有什么方法可以检查一下呢？即使他想独立的思考，但他所思考着的往往便都是一堆每天由报纸供应他的谎言。
    一般的美国人可以尽心的思考着苏联坦克开向德黑兰的消息；他可能得出他自己“独立”的结论。但他不知道的是苏联坦克根本从未开向德黑兰。可是，驳斥总是不能建立和原先那报告一样的效果的，诽谤的力量便是在于它总会留着痕迹。
    德黑兰离此很远。现在我已亲身在美国了，可是我还是读到了不少关于我的发表出来的消息。譬如说：消息传来说我在旅行全美国时始终由一个“苏联秘密警察的特务”陪伴着，但事实上我是由一个美国国务院的代表在陪伴着。他，根据这些骗人的访员们的话，便这样的变成了苏联秘密警察的特务了。
    时代杂志在说起我在全美国的旅行时，宣称：“这种采访自由是美国在莫斯科的记者一直梦想着而不知其为何物的。”这些话刊布在六月十日的时代杂志中第七十页上，在这本杂志的第三十页上，我读到了一个叫约翰·菲思邱的美国记者“在乌克兰作了三个月无限制的……观察后回抵美国”的消息。我不知道菲思邱在俄国时梦想着什么样的待遇。可能他因没人陪伴他作旅行而感遗憾。我私人对国务院的照顾是感激的，尤是因为陪伴我的纳尔逊先生是一个有极大文化修养和机智的人，我们现已成为极好的朋友。但我不能不指出时代杂志却利用我的旅行来给俄国投上一个暗影。
    如果美国新闻记者由苏联外交的代表陪伴着旅行，美国的记者便会大声尖叫，说他们的自由被剥夺了。如果一个苏联新闻记者由一个美国国务院的代表陪伴着，时代杂志便会说美国新闻记者不敢梦想这样的自由，我实在不懂得这样的逻辑，或者宁可说，我怕我懂得太清楚了。
    当美国人问我需要拿什么东西来增进我们相互的关系，我回答道：“同一的尺度”。读者们不要以为我要介绍米突制或摄氏制而作宣传了，他并无意于干涉美国内政：如果美国人欢喜用英尺来量，如果他们欢喜说水在三十二度时结冰，那是他们自己的事。不过，在对任何行动作估价时，最要紧的是要用同一的尺度。（未完）
