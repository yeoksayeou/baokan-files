Comrades! Today is National Day, and we in Yan'an are holding a conference here to launch a week-long campaign to demand that the U.S. military withdraw from China, that the U.S. government stop helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, that Chiang Kai-shek withdraw his troops from the occupied Liberated Areas, and that the January 10th ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference be implemented.

Today is the 35th Double Tenth Festival, but today our Chinese people have not yet fully achieved independence and liberation, and therefore cannot happily celebrate the Double Tenth Festival. Because there is an American imperialism that wants to destroy China, and there is a Chiang Kai-shek who wants to sell China to American imperialism and become a son-emperor and lackey of American imperialism to rule the Chinese people.

In January of this year, Chiang Kai-shek personally signed the ceasefire order, stipulating that all military conflicts in the country should cease, and that all troops should not be moved. Now Chiang Kai-shek has transferred 85 percent of his troops to fight the Liberated Areas, occupying many places in the Liberated Areas. Chiang Kai-shek's air force even flew American planes to bomb Zhangjiakou. Chiang Kai-shek said on the 6th that he would stop attacking Zhangjiakou for ten days, and on the 9th he bombed Zhangjiakou. Chiang Kai-shek has completely violated the ceasefire order, and he wants to fight the civil war to the end.

Our Chinese Communist Party, in order to seek peace for China, sent Chairman Mao to Chongqing last year, and later sent a delegation to negotiate. In the negotiations, we made countless concessions, and we conceded everything that could be conceded. But what Chiang Kai-shek wanted was to eliminate us. Our Liberated Areas have no beggars, no prostitutes, no poor people, no corrupt officials, and we have implemented democratic politics, production campaigns, and land to the tiller. Can such a good place be allowed to be eliminated by him? The contributions of the people, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army in our Liberated Areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan are far greater than those of Chiang Kai-shek. Can such a good army be allowed to be eliminated by him? Of course not! Chiang Kai-shek is determined to fight to the end, and we have only one way, which is to resolutely defend ourselves and resolutely fight him to the end! (Applause)

Chiang Kai-shek, this traitorous government, civil war government, and dictatorial government, is completely corrupt and extremely weak. Without the help of American imperialism, he would never dare to fight the civil war. American imperialism wants to destroy China, to turn the 450 million compatriots into its subjugated slaves, and to turn China into a battlefield for the Third World War, so it resolutely helps Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war and stations American troops in China.

China's territory and sovereignty belong to the Chinese people, not to Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek wants to betray the country and allow American troops to run rampant in China. The Chinese people will never allow it. American troops have no reason to be stationed in China's territory, running rampant, raping, plundering. The Chinese people do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, so they must demand that American troops withdraw from China and will not give up until they achieve their goal! (Applause)

Chiang Kai-shek did not dare to fight the civil war. The U.S. government gave him 4.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of weapons and supplies and helped him by stationing troops in China, which enabled him to launch a large-scale civil war. In the ten years after the September 18th Incident, the U.S. government did not help China's war of resistance against Japan at all, but provided a large amount of iron and gasoline to the Japanese imperialist bandits to slaughter the Chinese people. We Chinese people are magnanimous and have not mentioned this for a long time. In the past, American imperialists helped Japanese imperialists to fight the Chinese people, and now American imperialists are helping Chiang Kai-shek to fight the Chinese people. Their purpose is to turn China into a colony and turn Chinese compatriots into slaves of a conquered nation. The Chinese people do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, so they must oppose the American government's reactionary policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war. The Chinese people cannot tolerate this imperialist policy of the American government.

Comrades! American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek want us to be slaves of a conquered nation, and we resolutely answer them with three sentences: We would rather die than be slaves of a conquered nation, we would rather die than be slaves of a conquered nation, we would rather die than be slaves of a conquered nation! (Enthusiastic applause. The audience chanted: We would rather die than be slaves of a conquered nation!)

Thirty-five years ago, China had only a few hundred revolutionary party members who overthrew the Manchu Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for 267 years. Later, the Chinese people also overthrew Yuan Shikai, Cao Kun, and Wu Peifu. The Japanese imperialists who invaded China were also defeated by us.

Today, the Liberated Areas have a population of 140 million people, accounting for one-third of the country's population. There are 3.5 million regular troops and local corps, and 3 to 4 million militiamen. The strength of the people is many times greater than at any time in the past 35 years. We also have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Although there are still many difficulties on our way forward, we will surely win.

The American imperialist policy of aggression has been opposed by the American people. The American people have organized a "Withdraw from China" campaign week, holding large demonstrations in 35 cities, with 450,000 people participating in the marches, demanding that the U.S. government withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China. Former U.S. Vice President Wallace also openly criticized the U.S. government's erroneous policies, demanding a return to Roosevelt's policies and opposing foreign aggression.

The wise leader of the Soviet Union also advocated that U.S. troops should withdraw from China, and many people in Britain also demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from China. The vast number of democrats in Chiang Kai-shek's area are demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from China. The Chinese people are not isolated. We have many good friends in the United States and around the world who are supporting us.

We express our warm condolences and respect to the soldiers who are fighting bravely at the front. We warmly respond to the "Withdraw from China Movement" in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. We express our gratitude to friends all over the country! (Applause)

Long live the independence of the Chinese nation!
U.S. troops get out of China!
Oppose the U.S. government's aid to Chiang in the civil war!
Drive out Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops!
Implement the ceasefire order!
Implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference!
Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

    陆定一同志演说全文
    指斥蒋介石卖国的罪恶说明中国人民一定胜利
    同胞们！今天是国庆纪念节，我们延安各界在这里开大会举行一个运动周，要求美军退出中国，要求美国政府停止帮助蒋介石打内战，要求蒋介石把军队从侵占的解放区退出去，实行一月十日的停战令和政协会议的决议。
    今天是第卅五个双十节，但是今天我们中国人民还未完全得到独立解放，因此也还不能愉快的庆祝双十节。因为有一个美国帝国主义要想灭亡中国，有一个蒋介石想把中国卖给美国帝国主义，自己当美国帝国主义的儿皇帝狗腿子来统治中国人民。
    今年一月蒋介石亲自签订停战令，规定全国军事冲突都要停止，所有军队不许移动。现在蒋介石把全部军队的百分之八十五调来打解放区，占了解放区很多地方，蒋介石的空军还驾了美国飞机轰炸了张家口。蒋介石六日说停止进攻张家口十天，九日就轰炸张家口，蒋介石把停战令全部破坏了，他要把内战打到底。
    我们中国共产党为了求得中国的和平，去年毛主席去到重庆，后来又派代表团去谈判。在谈判中做了无数的让步，一切可以让的都让了，但是蒋介石要的是消灭我们。我们的解放区没有乞丐，没有娼妓，没有穷人，没有贪官污吏，实行了民主政治生产运动和耕者有其田，这样的好地方能够让他来消灭么？我们解放区的人民八路军新四军东北民主联军在抗战里面的功劳，比蒋介石不知大多少。这样的好军队能够让他来消灭么？当然不能够！蒋介石悍然要打到底，我们只有一个办法，就是坚决的自卫，坚决的同他打到底！（鼓掌）
    蒋介石这个卖国政府、内战政府、独裁政府，是腐败透了，是虚弱透了，没有美国帝国主义的帮助，他决不敢打内战。美国帝国主义要灭亡中国，要把中国四万万五千万同胞做他的亡国奴，要把中国变成第三次世界大战的战场，所以就坚决帮助蒋介石打内战，并且把美国的军队驻扎在中国。
    中国的领土主权属于中国人民，不是属于蒋介石，蒋介石要卖国，让美国军队在中国横行霸道，中国人民决不许可，美国军队没有任何理由驻扎在中国的领土上横行霸道奸淫掳掠。中国人民不愿当亡国奴，就一定要美国军队退出中国，不达目的决不罢休！（鼓掌）
    蒋介石不敢打内战，美国政府把四十四万万美金的武器和物资给他，用在华驻军帮助了他，他才敢大打内战。在“九一八”以后的十年中，美国政府对中国的抗日战争一点也不帮助，对于日本帝国主义强盗却大量供给铁和汽油来屠杀中国人民。我们中国人民宽大为怀，好久没有重提这件事了。从前美国帝国主义者帮助日本帝国主义者来打中国人民，现在美帝国主义者帮助蒋介石来打中国人民，其目的都是要把中国变成殖民地，把中国同胞变成奴国奴，中国人民不愿做亡国奴，就一定要反对美国政府援蒋内战的反动政策，中国人民不能忍受美国政府这种帝国主义的政策。
    同胞们！美国帝国主义和蒋介石要我们做亡国奴，我们坚决的回答他们三句话：我们宁死不当亡国奴，我们宁死不当亡国奴，我们宁死不当亡国奴！（热烈鼓掌。台下三呼：我们宁死不当亡国奴！）
    三十五年以前，中国只有几百个革命党员就把统治中国二百六十七年的满清推翻了。以后中国人民又推翻了袁世凯、曹锟、吴佩孚。侵略中国的日本帝国主义，也被我们打败了。
    今天解放区已有人民一万万四千万，占全国人口三分之一，正规军和地方兵团三百五十万，民兵三四百万，人民的力量比三十五年来任何时候都大得不知多少倍。我们还有毛主席和朱总司令的英明领导。在我们的前进途上虽然还有不少困难，但是我们是一定会胜利的。
    美国帝国主义的侵略政策遭到美国人民的反对，美国人民组织了“退出中国”运动周，在三十五个城市中举行了大示威，四十五万人参加游行，要求美国政府撤退驻华美军。美国前副总统华莱士亦公开批评美国政府的错误政策，要求恢复罗斯福政策，反对向外侵略。
    苏联的英明领袖亦主张美军应从中国撤退，英国也有很多人士要求美军退出中国。蒋介石区广大的民主人士都要求美军退出去中国。中国人民不是孤立的，美国以及全世界有我们很多的好朋友在支持我们。
    我们对在前方英勇作战的将士们表示热烈的慰问与敬礼，我们热烈响应上海重庆广州的“退出中国运动”，我们对于全国的朋友表示感谢！（鼓掌）
    中华民族独立万岁！
    美军退出中国去！
    反对美国政府助蒋内战！
    把蒋介石侵犯军打出去！
    实行停战令！
    实行政协决议！
    中国人民解放万岁！
