According to a report from our correspondent on the Anyang front dispatched from Changzhi on the 28th of this month: Following instructions from the Anyang Front Command, powerful guerrilla groups have been deployed to cooperate with the main force in launching a war to protect the autumn harvest, organizing people in border areas and refugees to return to their hometowns for the harvest. The government has also issued proclamations to villages occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, strictly prohibiting landlords who collaborated with the enemy from taking advantage of the situation to loot and steal the fruits of the people's struggle for liberation, guaranteeing the interests of the liberated masses, and reassuring them to await the opportunity to cooperate with our army in liberating their hometowns. The deployed guerrilla groups have launched an offensive to protect the autumn harvest in villages occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime. Powerful rush-harvesting teams have been organized in more than thirty villages along the border, scattered along the eighty-plus li border line in the west, south, and north, launching surprise rushes to harvest crops. Small-scale enemy harassment failed. Recently, the enemy concentrated large forces and, following two night raids on our Sixth District, extended their reach to Xishu Village on the night of the 17th, raiding the village, abducting more than fifty people and a large number of livestock and property. However, they were blocked by our militia's joint defense along the way, intercepting all the livestock and belongings, and freeing more than forty people. More than ten Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were injured and fled back to the Panliu stronghold. On the 18th, the entire force of about 700 puppet soldiers under Wang Zi, stationed in Taipingdian and Muchangtun in the Tenth District, attempted to loot the autumn harvest in the areas of Qianhoujing Canal, Lianzhuang, and Mazhuang. They were routed by a certain unit of our main force and militia in coordination, capturing seven puppet soldiers alive, leaving twenty-one puppet corpses and eleven heavily armed soldiers. We captured two light machine guns and more than ten rifles. On the same day, a part of the Qugou puppet security regiment, accompanied by two small cannons and one heavy machine gun, invaded Qin Xiaotun and Zhangwu. They were intercepted by the local militia, who fired guns everywhere and shouted loudly. The puppet soldiers were caught off guard, mistaking it for an encounter with our main force, and fled in panic. Our militia chased them all the way to the edge of Yongding Village, killing or wounding seven enemy soldiers. Enraged, the enemy launched a retaliatory attack on the 19th, deploying their entire regiment of more than 800 soldiers, forcing more than 500 people, and attempting to loot the harvest in the Yongding and Zhangdeng areas from Qugou. Our unit and militia, ambushed in the area, launched a fierce attack with hand grenades. The masses took the opportunity to escape to safety, and the puppet soldiers scattered and fled back to their lair. In the afternoon, the enemy gathered more than eighty soldiers to retaliate, but they were intercepted as soon as they left Qugou and fled back. The battle to protect the autumn harvest in the border areas is now becoming increasingly intense.
