　　[This dispatch from Changzhi, October 12th] (Delayed) The branch manager meeting held by the Taihang District Branch of Ji'nan Bank lasted half a month and concluded at the beginning of the month. The central discussion was on the business policy for the second half of the year. It was decided to issue a large number of production loans to support the development of winter agricultural, industrial, commercial, and transportation production, as well as various urban and rural industries and handicrafts. Rural credit cooperative loans will also be vigorously developed. It was decided to issue 134 million yuan in industrial and handicraft loans (including investments). This includes 33 million yuan for Xingtai City, 15 million yuan for Changzhi City, 30 million yuan for the First District, 21 million yuan for the Second District, 22 million yuan for the Third District, and 15 million yuan for the Fourth District. Agricultural loans total 154 million yuan, including 25 million yuan for the First District, 52 million yuan for the Second District, 45 million yuan for the Third District, 29 million yuan for the Fourth District, 2 million yuan for Xingtai City, and 1 million yuan for Changzhi City. Textile loans total 42 million yuan, including 12 million yuan each for the First and Second Districts, 10 million yuan for the Third District, and 8 million yuan for the Fourth District. Cooperative transportation loans total 66 million yuan, including 21 million yuan for the Second District, 16 million yuan each for the First and Third Districts, 12 million yuan for the Fourth District, and 1 million yuan for Changzhi City. Regarding the development of rural credit cooperatives, there are currently only four specialized credit cooperatives and fifteen cooperatives with concurrent credit business in the entire district. Based on the experience of the Suobao Credit Cooperative in She County, concurrent operation is preferable. Concurrent operation also requires independent funding, but overall profit sharing is necessary because the profit margin of the financial sector is lower than that of industry and commerce. If credit is operated exclusively, the dividends will not be significant. If funds are not independent in concurrent operation, the consumer department will inevitably misappropriate credit funds. According to investigations, there is still a significant amount of unorganized floating capital in rural areas. In Ma Village, Wu'xiang County, 113 women have earned profits from textile production in the first half of the year, with savings reaching over 400,000 yuan. Each person also has several kilograms of cotton stored. They cannot use this capital for continued textile production, resulting in significant waste. The development of rural credit cooperatives must promote savings, allowing this floating capital to be invested in production under the voluntary cooperation of farmers, providing rural areas with their own savings and lending institutions to revitalize rural finance. The bank must vigorously promote this movement in the future to play its due role in this winter's production. The meeting also decided that the main tasks for urban work in the future are to manage currency circulation, strengthen the struggle against stubborn puppet currency, prevent the outflow of materials, develop industry and commerce, and protect people's property. Counterfeit currency must be combatted by mobilizing the masses. The entire work of the bank must also be coordinated with the local party, government, military, and civilians to exert a unified force.

　　冀南银行太行区行
    确定半年业务方针
    发放生产贷款四万万
    吸收游资大力开展信用合作
    【本报长治十二日电】（迟到）冀南银行太行区行召开的分行经理会议，历时半月，已于月初闭幕，讨论中心为下半年业务方针。决定发放大批生产贷款，扶植农民冬季工商运输生产及各城乡工业、手工业的发展。并大力开展农村信用合作贷款。决定发放工业、手工业贷款一万万三千四百万元（包括投资）。邢台市三千三百万元，长治市一千五百万元，一分区三千万元，二分区二千一百万元，三分区二千二百万元，四分区一千五百万元。农业贷款一万万五千四百万元，计一分区二千五百万元，二分区五千二百万元，三分区四千五百万元，四分区二千九百万元，邢台市二百万元，长治市一百万元。纺织贷款共四千二百万元，计一、二分区各一千二百万元，三分区一千万元，四分区八百万元。合作运输贷款共六千六百万元，计二分区二千一百万元，一、三分区各一千六百万元，四分区一千二百万元，长治市一百万元。关于发展农村信用合作问题，目前全区仅四个专门信用合作社与十五个兼营信用业务的合作社。根据涉县索堡信用合作社经验，以兼营为宜，兼营亦需资金独立，但必须整体分红，因钱业利润较工商业利润低。若专营信用，红利不大，兼营若资金不独立，则消费部势必挪占信用基金。据调查，目前农村中未组织起来之游资尚多。武乡马村一百一十三个妇女，经前半年纺织获利，手中存款达四十万余元。每人还存棉花数斤。这一部资金，她们继续纺织是用不了的，因之浪费很大。发展农村信用合作，必须提倡储蓄，使这种游资在农民自愿合作下投入生产，使农村有自己的储蓄与借贷机关，以活跃农村金融。今后银行必须大力开展这一运动，使在今冬生产中起其应有作用。会议并决定今后城市工作主要在管理通货、加强对顽伪货币斗争，防止物资外溢，发展工商业，保护人民财产。反伪钞必须发动群众力量，银行整个工作亦须与本区党政军民配合一致，发挥一元化的力量。
