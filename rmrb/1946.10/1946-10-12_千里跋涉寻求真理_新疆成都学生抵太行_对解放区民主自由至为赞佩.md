　　Traveling Thousands of Miles to Seek Truth
    Xinjiang and Chengdu Students Arrive in Taihang
    Praising the Democracy and Freedom of the Liberated Areas
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 8th] Twelve young students, including Zhang Yuzhen and Chen Qing, from Xinjiang, Chengdu, and Taiyuan, arrived at the Taihang Administrative Office's location on September 30th. The Administrative Office held a welcoming reception and hosted a banquet for them. When they passed through Changzhi City, they visited Changzhi Normal School and praised the democratic and free atmosphere of the schools in the liberated areas. Recalling the suppression of young people's thoughts and the lack of freedom of speech and action in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, they were even more indignant. Chen Qing, a student from Chengdu, said, "In our school, each class has special agents sent by the Military Statistics Bureau. Their guns have taken away our freedom." Zhang Yuzhen, a student from Xinjiang Women's College, revealed the bleak state of education in Xinjiang under Kuomintang rule with concrete facts: "Before 1942, in the era of free Xinjiang, our school had more than 5,000 students. After Chiang Kai-shek came to power, it suddenly dropped to just over 1,000. Teachers with knowledge, prestige, and a sense of justice were all excluded, and the number of teachers was reduced from 40 or 50 to just over 10. When we left the school, only nine students remained in the university department." They expressed that after arriving in the liberated areas, they felt free to breathe and saw a bright future for themselves and China. They all said, "We came to pursue the truth, and now we have finally achieved our wish!"

　　千里跋涉寻求真理
    新疆成都学生抵太行
    对解放区民主自由至为赞佩
    【本报长治八日电】由新疆、成都、太原来我区之青年学生张玉珍、陈清等十二人，于九月三十日到达太行行署驻地。行署特举行欢迎会，并设宴为其洗尘。他们旅途经长治市时，曾参观了长治师范，对解放区学校民主自由的空气，赞赏不置。回忆到蒋管区青年的思想被束缚，言语行动不自由，益加愤慨。成都来的陈清同学说：“我们学校里每班都有军统局派的特务，他们的手枪，夺去了我们的自由。”新疆女子学院的同学张玉珍以具体事实揭露国民党统治下暗淡的新疆教育说：“民国三十一年前在自由新疆时代，我们学校有学生五千余人，以后到了蒋介石统治下，骤减到千余人。有学问有威望有正义感的教员都被排斥，教员由四、五十人减至十余人，在我们离校时，大学部里只剩下九个学生了。”他们表示来到解放区后，感到呼吸自由，看到了自己与中国的光明前途。都说：“我们为追求真理而来，现在我们终于达到愿望了！”
