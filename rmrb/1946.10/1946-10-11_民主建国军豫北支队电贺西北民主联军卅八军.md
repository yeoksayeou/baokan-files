To Commander Kong and Deputy Commander Liu, and all officers and soldiers of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army in Handan:

We are thrilled to hear of the establishment of your esteemed army! At a time when the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique is frantically attacking the Liberated Areas and meeting with repeated setbacks, this is another heavy blow to them. This fully proves the great power of the people, which no oligarchic tyrant can defy. However, Chiang's offensive has not ceased. We must work closely with the Eighth Route Army, side by side, to defend the Liberated Areas and protect the people. Under the leadership of the people's leader, Chairman Mao, we will carry forward our past fine tradition of "the people supporting the army, and the army protecting the people," and fight to the end for an independent, peaceful, democratic, united, and unified New China. We hereby send our congratulations!

(Respectfully)
Niu Zilong, Commander of the Democratic National Construction Army, Northern Henan Detachment; Yue Benjing, Deputy Commander; Li Huitian, Director of Political Affairs; leading all commanders and fighters.

    欣闻贵军成立，敝部全军振奋！值兹卖国贼蒋介石集团正在疯狂进攻解放区碰钉之际，又与他当头一棒，由此足证明人民力量之大，非寡头独夫所能逆料者。但蒋贼进攻未已，我们要和八路军密切并肩作战、保卫解放区保护人民，在人民领袖毛主席领导下，发扬我们过去“人民养兵，兵当保民”的优良传统，为独立和平民主团结统一的新中国而奋斗到底，谨电驰贺！
