　　"Pulling" and "Crashing"
　　Fang Zhizhong
　　In earlier years, deaths caused by cars in Shanghai were commonplace. They emphasized streamlined designs, and the faster the car went, the more impressive the automobile class appeared. Bipeds who couldn't get out of the way in time became ghosts under the wheels. Passengers would offer some compensation, and the case would be closed. There were also black-plated cars belonging to Chiang's companies, parked by streets and alleyways, specially "pulling" "patriotic criminals." If you were unlucky enough to encounter such a free ride, you would either be invited to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to experience electric shocks, or to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters for dissection. If you survived, you would have to face the wall for several years. Famous cultural figures such as Lou Shiyi and Li Jianhua rode in these cars and didn't see the light of day for years.
　　After Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese for seven or eight years, and then "received" and "beautified" by the Kuomintang for over a year, its progress should naturally and indeed has been startling. Let's see what Mr. Guo Moruo reported:
　　"Some say that Shanghai has organized a jeep death squad, with over a hundred jeeps, specially for running over and killing figures of interest on the streets..."
　　Last year, when the Kuomintang reactionaries were still residing in the foothills of Mount Emei, his Uncle Sam's jeeps were specially used to "pull" pretty Chinese girls on the streets of Chongqing. The phrase "Jeep Girls" is soaked in how much blood and tears! Now that jeeps have arrived in Shanghai, they have become "specially for running over and killing figures of interest." For the Chinese people, the shift from "pulling" to "crashing" symbolizes a kind of progress in the aggressive methods of American imperialists. Secondly, Kuomintang secret agents used to kidnap people in Shanghai using cars. After kidnapping, they still had to kill or bury them, which was quite troublesome. Moreover, the sudden disappearance of a "figure of interest" would cause "interested" people to speculate wildly, even "spread rumors," and if they were not careful and the truth was exposed, they would get a bad name. Now, after "running over and killing" with a jeep, they can say that the deceased violated traffic regulations and deserved to die, or that the driver lost control, and at most, they would pay for a coffin. It's both civilized and scientific, resolving everything neatly. Isn't that a straightforward way to do things? This is progress in the Kuomintang's killing methods, which is also progress in Shanghai's "civilization."
　　But in the eyes of the Chinese people, the "jeep" is truly a "ill-omened vehicle," and "beautification" is actually "deterioration." Guo then sighed, "The world today is truly full of wonders!" I say that what the Kuomintang reactionaries have done in the past ten years is "nothing is not strange," and the progress in their killing methods is "not surprising." However, if Chiang Kai-shek's rule could last forever, then Qin Shi Huang's empire should have been maintained until now, and we "commoners" should have been extinct long ago. But history's verdict on Qin Shi Huang is "extinguished in the second generation," and on Chiang Kai-shek, it will be "cannot be passed down." Because since China produced the Emperor Chiang, there have been nine years of chaos out of ten. The Chinese people have the strength and courage to live on.

　　“拉”和“撞”
    方之中
    早些年，上海的汽车杀人，倒是司空见惯。那是讲什么流线型，汽车开得越快，越显得汽车阶级威风，来不及让开路的两足动物，就沦为车下之鬼了。乘客拿点恤金，命案从此了结。也有一种蒋记公司的黑牌汽车，停在街旁弄口，专拉“爱国犯”乘座，不幸遇到这种免费汽车，不是请你到上海市公安局去尝电刑，就是请你到龙华警备司令部去行解剖，幸而不死，也得面壁几年，著名文化人楼适夷、李剑华都是乘的这种汽车，好几年不见天日。
    上海沦陷后日化了七八年，国民党“接收”后又美化了一年多，自然其进步应该而且实已骇人听闻，且看郭沫若先生报导：
    “有人说上海已组织了一个杀人的吉普车团，有百多部吉普车，专门在街头撞杀注意人物……”
    去年国民党反动派还小住在峨嵋山下时，他的山姆大伯的吉普车，专在重庆街头拉中国的漂亮女郎，“吉普女郎”四个字，不知浸渍着多少血和泪！现在吉普车到了上海，变为“专门在街头撞杀注意人物”了，对中国人民，由“拉”到“撞”，是象征了美帝国主义分子侵略方式的一种进步。其次国民党特务分子从前在上海用汽车绑人，绑了之后，还得杀或埋，怪麻烦，况且社会上平空少了一个“注意人物”，引起“注意”者妄加猜疑，甚至“造谣”且不说，稍一不慎，暴露真相，还落得一个恶名。现在用吉普车“撞杀”后，可以说死者违犯警章，死得活该，可以说司机失手，至多赔口棺材，既文明，又科学，一了百结，岂不干脆了事也哉，这是国民党杀人方法的进步，也就是上海“文明”的进步。
    只是在中国人民面前，“吉普车”实在是“凶普车”，“美化”就是“恶化”。郭氏既而叹道：“现今的世道，也真是无奇不有了！”我说国民党反动派十余年所作的事，就是“无有不奇”，其杀人方法的进步，也就“不足为奇”了。不过如果蒋介石的统治还能万寿无疆，那末秦始皇的天下应当维持到现在，而我们“庶民”呢，就应该早已灭种了。然历史对秦始皇的判决：是“二世而亡”，对蒋介石呢，当“不可一世”。因为中国自从出了蒋皇帝，十年倒有九年乱。中国人民，有力量有勇气要活下去。
