　　Utilizing Winter Slack to Strengthen the People's Armed Forces
    Southern Hebei's 200,000 Militiamen Engage in Large-Scale Military Training
    Preparing Forces to Cooperate with the Eighth Route Army to Crush Chiang Kai-shek's and Puppet Troops' Offensive
    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County, 22nd] With the autumn harvest completed, the 200,000 militiamen of Southern Hebei are about to launch a large-scale military training movement, eager to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army in a comprehensive resistance to defend the liberated areas. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the total number of militiamen in Southern Hebei was only several hundred, their weapons mainly consisting of broadswords and red-tasseled spears. After eight years of resistance against the enemy and the self-defense war against stubborn and puppet troops after the victory of the War of Resistance, the number has grown from several hundred to 200,000. Moreover, they have captured a large number of weapons from the enemy in battles, equipping themselves. Currently, the 200,000 militiamen have generally learned to use landmines and hand grenades. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the militiamen in this area possess ××× grenade launchers, ××× light and heavy machine guns, × ten thousand × thousand various short guns, and × ten thousand × thousand × hundred rifles and carbines, having become an invincible force. The Southern Hebei Military Commission has issued an urgent call to launch a winter military training movement, calling for turning the training into a self-defense movement of the broad masses of the area, turning it into a powerful war preparation effort, and strengthening the work of the militia organizationally and ideologically, preparing forces to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army to crush the joint offensive of Chiang Kai-shek and the US, and strive for the victory of the comprehensive resistance.
