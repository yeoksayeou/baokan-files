　　Taihang District Party Committee Decides
    Promote Serving the People Spirit
    Cadres Must Not Buy Fruits Cheaply
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] In order to promote the noble revolutionary quality of cadres serving the masses, the Taihang District Committee of the Communist Party of China issued on the 12th the "Decision on the Issue of How County and District Cadres Should Treat the Fruits of Struggle in Mass Movements." The decision stated: Our district's cadres have withstood severe tests during the years of continuous natural disasters during the War of Resistance and the victory over the War of Resistance. In the past few years, when mobilizing the masses, cadres have never taken a single bit of the fruits of the masses' struggle. This glorious revolutionary quality is worth promoting. Since the victory, a few cadres have developed hedonistic ideas, and individual county and district cadres have even taken the fruits of the masses' struggle by means of cheap purchases, which should arouse serious vigilance among all our party's cadres. This phenomenon not only provides landlords and special agents with excuses to spread rumors, but will also affect internal unity and corrupt the fine qualities of cadres. For this reason, it is decided: The fruits of the mass movement shall be entirely handled by the masses. Local poor cadres who are entitled to a share should be distributed the same as the masses and shall not seek to take more or obtain them by disguised means. County and district cadres who have taken the fruits of struggle in the past in the form of cheap purchases, etc., must return them to the masses within a limited time. Those that have been consumed shall be compensated at a reasonable price. If this is not implemented, disciplinary sanctions will be imposed, up to and including expulsion from the Party, in order to maintain our Party's noble revolutionary quality of serving the masses and its hard-working style. Party committees at all levels should mobilize cadres to conduct self-criticism, launch criticism movements, and commend the exemplary work style of model cadres.

　　太行区党委决定
    发扬为民服务精神
    干部不得贱买果实
    【本报长治讯】为发扬干部为群众服务的崇高革命品质，中共太行区党委于十二日发布“群运中县区干部对待斗争果实问题的决定，”该决定称：我区干部在坚持抗战与战胜抗战期间连年天灾中，经受了严重的考验。数年来在发动群众时，干部对群众斗争果实从未分取丝毫，这种光荣的革命品质值得发扬，胜利以来，少数干部产生享乐思想，竟有个别县区干部以贱价收买等方式分取群众斗争果实，实应引起我全党干部的严重警惕。此种现象不仅授地主特务以造谣借口，且将影响内部团结，腐蚀干部优良品质，为此决定：群运求实完全由群众处理，本地贫苦干部应分者与群众一样分配，不得借口多分或变相苟取。县区干部过去以贱价收买等形式所取之斗争果实，限期退给群众，已消耗者酌价赔偿。如不执行，即以纪律制裁直至开除党籍，以保持我党为群众服务的崇高革命品质与艰苦作风。各级党委应发动干部作自我检查，开展批评运动，表扬模范干部的模范作风。
