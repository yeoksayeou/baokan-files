[Jilu Yu Thirteenth Dispatch] Thousands of militiamen in Peixian and Tongshan are intensifying their encirclement of the Chiang army in Peixian city. They are currently launching a widespread landmine warfare campaign, foiling the Chiang army's attempt to open the Peixian-Tongshan highway as a supply line to expand the civil war in the Jilu Yu region. In the past twenty-odd days, the Peixian and Tongshan militias have engaged in more than thirty battles, killing, wounding, and capturing over fifty Chiang soldiers and Chiang secret agents with tactics such as landmines and sniper fire, seizing over thirty long and short guns and a set of important documents.

[Another Dispatch] Guerrilla warfare is being widely carried out by the masses in the Jilu Yu Plain, and the Chiang army, which occupies eight isolated towns, is frequently subjected to attacks. On the 18th, a guerrilla team south of Dongming, at Yangji, routed a unit of the Chiang army, killing or wounding twelve Chiang soldiers, seizing a light machine gun, and recovering all the grain plundered by Chiang's special agents and returning it to the masses. On the 19th, another guerrilla team ambushed west of Dahuanji in Heze, killing or wounding over fifty Chiang soldiers. On the same day, another guerrilla team drove away the "Homecoming Corps" of Chiang's special agents who had come to harass them from Caoxian, intercepted the grain they had plundered, and returned it to the masses. On the southern section of the Longhai Railway, the Chiang army security regiment and special agents, numbering over one hundred and twenty, from Ningling County, attacked Dayangzhuang, south of the county, on the 19th and were fiercely attacked by the local guerrillas, suffering over thirty casualties and the loss of a heavy machine gun. On the eastern front, over three hundred Chiang soldiers occupying Shanxian County advanced along the Shan (county)-Feng (county) highway on the 30th to attack Xingji and Yangji, and were continuously attacked by militiamen along the route, and fled back to Shanxian city in a sorry state that day.
