　　Chiang Kai-shek's Aggression Repelled by Our Forces
    Hua and Jun Cities Regained
    Taiyue Guerrilla Regiment Recaptures Tongshen Town
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, 29th] The Eighth Route Army in Northern Henan repelled the invading forces of the puppet Sun Dianying and his special agent-led bandit forces from Hua County on the 24th, immediately recovering Hua County. On the 26th, they followed up the victory by recovering Jun County, which had been briefly occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's forces. In coordination with the aggression against our Ji-Lu-Yu region, Chiang Kai-shek specifically ordered the puppet Sun Dianying and the association-led bandits and special agent forces under his control to launch a large-scale invasion of our Liberated Areas on both sides of the Ping-Han Railway in Northern Henan. They captured Jun County on the 22nd and Hua County on the 24th. Our defending forces, taking advantage of their unstable foothold, repelled the puppet and stubborn troops who had invaded Hua County on the night of the 24th, and followed up the victory by clearing out the stubborn puppet troops occupying more than ten villages and towns in the suburbs of the city; on the 26th, they defeated the stubborn puppet troops who had invaded Jun County. Our democratic government immediately entered the city with the army to carry out post-war relief work.
    [Report from Yangcheng, 30th] Our Taiyue Guerrilla Regiment recaptured Tongshen Town in Yuanqu on the 23rd. On the 22nd, over 1,000 soldiers of Chiang's 30th Brigade invaded Magu Mountain and Chen Village from the north of Yuanqu, but were repelled by our forces. One route of Chiang's invading troops that advanced upward suffered heavy casualties in our counterattack and have retreated to Qiaogou. Tongshen Town was immediately recovered by our forces.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian] Following the recovery of 15 strongholds including Dui Jiu Yu in the Xiaoyi area of Central Shanxi, the Eighth Route Army has launched attacks on Yi Xing, Shangzha, Wangmacun, Dongwanglu and other places in Xiaoyi for days. The puppet Yan Xishan troops fled upon hearing the news, and the aforementioned areas were recovered. A total of more than 270 Yan Xishan soldiers were captured and a large number of weapons were seized. After this blow, Yan Xishan's troops became increasingly shaken. On the 20th of this month, 29 Yan Xishan soldiers stationed in Xiaoyi, unwilling to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war, surrendered to the Eighth Route Army with one light machine gun and more than ten rifles. Furthermore, the Eighth Route Army stationed in the Xixian area, in coordination with local militias, liberated Yiquan Town, 30 li southeast of Xixian, capturing more than 30 Yan Xishan soldiers, and seizing 8 rifles and one light machine gun.
