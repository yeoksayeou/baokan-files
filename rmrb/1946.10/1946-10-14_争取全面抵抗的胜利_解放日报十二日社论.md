Jiang Jieshi and his American collaborators brazenly rejected the Chinese Communist Party's peace proposals. After attempting to coerce the CCP into surrender with an ultimatum, they implemented a step towards a complete rupture—occupying Zhangjiakou. Over the past nine months, the CCP has made countless persistent efforts to protect and salvage peace. However, Jiang Jieshi, who chanted "political solution," and his American collaborators, who chanted "peaceful mediation," only wanted the surrender and elimination of the CCP and all democratic forces in China. The CCP must solemnly declare that the Chinese people will never yield to Jiang Jieshi's reactionary dictatorship and military unification. Contrary to the perfidious Jiang Jieshi and his American daddy, the Chinese people must fight to the end to uphold the sacred armistice order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference! Now, the hope of the entire nation rests on the Chinese Communist Party. They demand that the CCP temporarily abandon Zhangjiakou in the self-defense war, rather than sacrifice the Chinese people's indomitable national integrity. They are not surprised at all by the retreat from Zhangjiakou; on the contrary, they know that Jiang Jieshi has only swallowed a bomb, both politically and militarily.

For over a year, Zhangjiakou, under the administration of the democratic government, has become a famous model city in the East. The world has thereby confirmed that the CCP is not only good at leading the countryside but also good at leading cities, being ten thousand times superior to Jiang Jieshi's corrupt and evil government. The temporary retreat from Zhangjiakou is, of course, a loss for the people, but from a realistic military point of view, it has not created difficulties for the people. At present, the decisive key to the Chinese war lies not in the temporary gains and losses of a few cities, but in the changes in the military strength of both sides. This has become common knowledge among the people. If the people could still rely on annihilating enemy forces to achieve victory in the Ten-Year Civil War (when the people did not have a single county town at the beginning) and the Eight-Year War of Resistance (when the people did not have a single county town other than the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at the beginning), then what's wrong with temporarily withdrawing from some towns in the liberated areas with a population of 144 million today to gain the conditions for annihilating enemy forces? In fact, precisely because of this, the self-defense war in the liberated areas today began with mobile warfare as the main form, rather than guerrilla warfare. From the very beginning, it was able to annihilate a large number of enemies in large-scale battles. Moreover, in the three months from July to September, it annihilated as many as twenty-five brigades of Jiang's main force. In other words, even before peace was finally despaired of, before the liberated areas officially announced comprehensive resistance, before the people in the liberated areas began to mobilize, began to pour into the regular army, guerrilla forces, and militia, and began to concentrate their forces, the basic trend of Jiang's army becoming weaker and weaker and our army becoming stronger and stronger was already clear. In the future, after the people in the liberated areas have dispelled the illusion of peace and lifted the burden of protecting cities like Zhangjiakou, their military strength will surely become even stronger, and their use of troops will be even more free and mobile, while the situation on Jiang Jieshi's side is exactly the opposite. Jiang Jieshi's forces attacking the liberated areas have approached their limit, accounting for 85 percent of his total forces. About half of them must be used for defense, and another part of the other half used for attack must continue to be transferred to defense. The remaining part is constantly being hit by annihilation. Therefore, although his forces can temporarily occupy a few towns by relying on equipment, they cannot clear the railways and highways, let alone maintain an advantage in field battles. After occupying Zhangjiakou, Jiang Jieshi may even be able to occupy a few more towns, but his defense line will be stretched even longer, his supply line will be more difficult to maintain, and his passivity and weaknesses in combat will be greater, so the chances of being annihilated will inevitably increase greatly compared to before. When Jiang's army is annihilated to a certain extent, the liberated areas can switch to a victorious counter-offensive. Therefore, since Jiang Jieshi has brazenly occupied Zhangjiakou, all the troops and all the people in our entire liberated areas must unite as one, make the final and greatest determination, work seriously and diligently, and fight back with determination. We must definitely exceed the self-defense achievements of the past three months in the future and annihilate more of Jiang's troops. We must thoroughly smash Jiang Jieshi's offensive, recover Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Jining, Heze, Huaiyin, and all the lost territories, so as to restore domestic peace and implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

Of course, Jiang Jieshi can further betray the country to obtain more aid from the United States and further oppress the people to replenish his forces. Therefore, the war will inevitably be long-term, and we must make full preparations for this. But even so, Jiang Jieshi's fundamental difficulties cannot be solved. Jiang Jieshi's front is too wide. It can be asserted that the development of a comprehensive war will inevitably make the front wider and wider. Jiang Jieshi's morale is too low. It can be asserted that as a result of constant annihilation and constant replenishment with conscripted laborers, the morale of Jiang's army will definitely become lower and lower in the future, and its combat effectiveness will definitely become weaker and weaker. In the past year, there have been uprisings by generals such as Gao Shuxun, Hao Pengju, Pan Shuoduan, Kong Congzhou, and Cao Yousan, as well as air force personnel such as Liu Shanben and Zhang Shouyi. It can be asserted that there will definitely be more and more such uprisings in the future. The people in the Jiang-controlled areas in Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places are now rebelling with arms. It can be asserted that such resistance in the empty areas of Jiang's army will definitely become the second battlefield of the civil war in the future. Jiang Jieshi's economic foundation is too weak, and his entire bureaucratic ruling machine is too corrupt. If he could barely drag on for six or seven years after the fall of Wuhan through tacit understanding with the Japanese, then it can be asserted that he will definitely not be able to use a worse foundation and a worse machine to drag on for a longer period of intense war. Jiang Jieshi cannot solve all these difficulties, nor can his American daddy help him solve them. Moreover, today's United States is no longer the United States in the anti-fascist war. At that time, the United States was politically united; today, it is divided. At that time, the United States was economically upward; today, it is watching to go downward. The economic crisis of American imperialism itself and the resulting political crisis are rapidly brewing. The good dreams of his Chinese son will not be very long. Whether before or after he wakes up from his dreams, in any case, blood debts must be repaid with blood. Jiang Jieshi's sins of today must be borne by himself!

　　争取全面抵抗的胜利
    解放日报十二日社论
    蒋介石及其美国合作者悍然拒绝中共的和平建议，在企图以最后通牒限期威迫中共投降失败以后，实行了全面破裂的步骤——占领张家口。过去九个月中，中共为了保护和挽救和平曾作无数次坚忍的努力，但是高唱“政治解决”的蒋介石及其高唱“和平调处”的美国合作者，却只要中共和中国一切民主力量的投降和消灭，中共不得不严正表示，对于蒋介石的反动独裁和武力统一，中国人民将永不会屈服，中国人民与背信弃义的蒋介石及其美国爸爸相反，一定要为坚持神圣的停战令和政协决议而奋斗到底！现在全国人民的希望都寄托于中国共产党，他们要求中共宁可在自卫战争中暂时放弃张家口，而绝不要牺牲中国人民大无畏的民族正气；他们对于张家口的撤退丝毫不感惊异，相反的他们知道蒋介石无论在政治上和军事上都只是吞下了一颗炸弹。
    一年多以来，张家口在民主政府管理下成了东方著名的模范城市，全世界由此证实了中共不但善于领导乡村，而且善于领导城市，比充满贪污的蒋介石恶政府高明万倍。张家口的暂时撤退，对于人民当然是一个损失，但是就现实的军事观点上说，这对于人民却没有造成困难。现时中国战争的决定关键，不在少数城市的暂时得失，而在双方军事实力的消长，这已经成为人民的常识了。如果人民在十年内战（开始时人民没有一个县城）和八年抗战（开始时人民除了陕甘宁边区以外也没有一个县城）中还能依靠歼灭敌军实力而取得胜利，那末今天在一万万四千万人口的解放区中暂时退出一些城镇来换得歼灭敌军的条件，又有什么不好呢？事实上正因为如此，今天解放区自卫战争，一开始就是以运动战为主而非以游击战为主，一开始就能在大兵团作战中大量歼灭敌人，又在过去七月至九月三个月中间，歼灭了蒋军主力廿五个旅之多。换句话说，还在和平没有最后绝望，解放区没有正式宣布全面抵抗以前，还在解放区人民开始转入动员，开始涌入正规军游击队和民兵、并开始集中兵力的时候，蒋军愈战愈弱我军愈战愈强的基本趋势就已经明明白白了。今后解放区人民解除了和平的幻想，解除了像保护张家口这类城市的负担以后，其军事力量必更见愈战愈强，其兵力使用必更见自由机动，而蒋介石方面的情形却正好相反。蒋介石进攻解放区的兵力已经接近极限，占他全部兵力的百分之八十五，其中约一半要用于守备，其用于进攻的另一半又须继续转用一部分于守备，其余的部分又不断遭受歼灭的打击，因此他的兵力虽能依靠装备暂时占几个城镇，却不能打通铁路线和公路线，更不能在野战中保持优势。蒋介石在占领张家口以后或者甚至还能再占几个城镇，但是他的防线拉的更长了，他的补给线更难维持了，他在作战中的被动性更大，弱点更多，因此被歼灭的机会必然比以前大大增加。蒋军被歼到一定程度，解放区就可以转入胜利反攻。因此蒋介石既已悍然占领张家口，我们全解放区的一切军队，一切人民就一定要团结一致，下最后最大的决心，严肃努力，发愤反抗，一定在今后超过过去三个月的自卫战绩，歼灭更多的蒋军。一定要彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻，收复张家口、承德、集宁、荷泽、淮阴以及一切失地，以便恢复国内和平和实现政协的一切决议。
    当然，蒋介石还可以进一步卖国来取得美国更多的援助，进一步残民来补充他的兵力，因此战争必然是长期的，对于这一点我们要作充分的准备。但是即令如此，蒋介石的根本困难还是不能解决，蒋介石的战线太广了，可以断定全面战争的发展，一定使战线越来越广。蒋介石的士气太低了，可以断定不断遭受歼灭和不断用拉夫补充的结果，蒋军的士气以后一定越来越低，战斗力以后一定越来越弱。在过去一年内已有高树勋、郝鹏举、潘朔端、孔从周、曹又参等将军和刘善本、张受益等空军人员的起义，可以断定这种起义，以后一定越来越多。蒋管区的人民在四川、湖南、浙江、福建、广东等地现在已经纷纷武装反抗，可以断定蒋军空虚地区的这种反抗，以后一定会变为内战的第二战场。蒋介石的经济基础是太衰败了，他的全副官僚统治机器是太腐烂了，如果在武汉失守后他还可以用与日本人的默契勉强拖过六七年时间，那么可以断定他一定不能用更坏的基础更坏的机器来拖过更长久的紧张战争的时间。一切这些困难，蒋介石固然不能解决，他的美国爸爸也不能帮他解决。况且今天的美国也已经不是反法西斯战争中的美国。那时美国在政治上是团结的，今天，是分裂的了；那时美国在经济上是向上的，今天是眼看要向下了。美帝国主义本身的经济危机和由此而来的政治危机正在迅速酝酿，他的中国儿子的好梦一定不会很长，无论是在他梦醒以前还是以后，无论如何，血债一定要用血来还，蒋介石今天的一切罪恶，一定要自食其果！
