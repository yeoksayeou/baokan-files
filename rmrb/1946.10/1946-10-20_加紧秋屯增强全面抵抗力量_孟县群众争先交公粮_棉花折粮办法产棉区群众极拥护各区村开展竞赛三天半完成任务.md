　　[This newspaper Yangcheng, 17th dispatch] The Meng County Democratic Government arranged the autumn storage work on September 5th. In order to adapt to the war situation, ensure military needs, save transportation and civilian labor, and specifically implement the policy of rewarding cotton planting, it was decided that cotton should be converted at market prices to offset public grain in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, where more cotton is produced. The liberated masses of Meng County immediately responded to the government's call and are currently enthusiastically delivering public grain to enhance the material strength of comprehensive resistance. Each district proposed standards for mutual competition: 1. Handle it fairly and reasonably. 2. Deliver it quickly and well. The cadres and masses of each village regarded this work as an urgent task to support the front line, working day and night, and completed the task ahead of schedule within three days. Hu Village, the deputy director of the Autumn Storage Committee in the Sixth District, did not get to sleep for several nights. Du Youfang of Dongtian Village ginned 30 catties of cotton in six hours in order to quickly deliver cotton. A cart in Hanzhuang ginned 20 *hua* (one *hua* is a large scale of ten catties) in half a day and one night, and gave up two carts to help Yijing complete the task at the same time. Meng Qingxin, an activist in Dongyao, did not have enough production to bear the burden, but voluntarily contributed two *hua* to support the self-defense front line. He also volunteered to participate in sending *hua*, without eating at other people's homes. The common people all said, "Quickly hand in the public grain so that our Eighth Route Army can eat enough and dress warmly, so they can work hard to fight old Chiang." Wei Zongmin of Beng Village said, "This year's burden is two shares less than the old days and when the stubborn elements were in power, so it should be paid quickly and on time." The masses discussed one after another, saying: "The democratic government's method of thinking for the people is really good. Those who grow grain pay grain, and those who grow cotton pay cotton. Converting cotton into public grain is both fair and convenient. One catty of cotton is worth 26 catties of grain, and one load can carry ten *shi*, which can also save a lot of foot money." In addition to issuing "Autumn Storage Express" to commend this high level of enthusiasm from the masses, the county government also took out 60,000 yuan in bonuses and six silk banners to reward models. The masses in the districts and villages who delivered grain are also working hard to thresh and mill rice to pay public grain, all saying: "The rice for public grain must be milled cleaner, so that the soldiers fighting old Chiang at the front will see good rice and good food, and they will see the hearts of our common people!"

    孟县群众争先交公粮
    棉花折粮办法产棉区群众极拥护  各区村开展竞赛三天半完成任务
    【本报阳城十七日电】孟县民主政府于九月五日布置秋屯工作。为适应战争情况、保证军需、节省运输民力、并具体执行奖励植棉政策起见；决定四、五、六区产棉多，即以棉花按市价折合，抵交公粮。孟县翻身群众立即响应政府号召，刻正踊跃交公粮，以增强全面抵抗的物质力量。各区提出标准互相竞赛：一、办得公道合理。二、交得要快要好。各村干部群众把这一工作当做支援前线的紧要工作，昼夜忙碌，三天内即提前完成任务。六区胡村秋屯委员会副主任数夜未得就寝。东田大村杜有芳为迅速交棉花，六小时内即轧花三十斤。韩庄一辆车半天一夜轧了二十个花（一个花大秤十斤），并让出两辆车帮助义井在同时完成任务。东窑积极分子孟庆新产量不足负担，但自愿献出两个花支援自卫前线。还自愿参加送花，不吃别家饭。老百姓都说：“赶快把公粮交齐，叫咱八路军吃饱，穿暖，好使劲打老蒋。”绷村魏宗民说：“今年负担比老日子、顽固在时三股少缴两股，应当很快按时交。”群众纷纷议论说：“民主政府给老百姓想的办法真好。种粮食的交粮食，种棉花的交棉花。棉花折公粮，又公道，又便利。一斤花顶二十六斤粮，一担能担十来石，还能节省好多脚钱。”县政府对群众这种高度的热情，除出“秋屯快报”表扬外，还拿出六万元奖金，六面锦旗奖励模范。交粮食的各区、村群众，亦正紧张打场碾米交纳公粮，都说：“交公粮的米可要碾净些，叫前方打老蒋的战士们看见好米好饭，就看见咱老百姓的心！”
