　　Sends Letter to Chiang's Soldiers and Officers Opposing the Civil War

　　[This newspaper reported] Division Commander Zhao Xitian of the Reorganized 3rd Division recently sent a letter to Chiang's soldiers and officers, explaining the preferential treatment he received in the Eighth Route Army, the course of the recent ceasefire, and his political views for the future. The original letter is published below:

　　To the officers and brothers of the Kuomintang army at all levels (army, division, brigade, regiment):

　　I, Zhao Xitian, was ordered to lead the Third Division from the border area of western Hubei and southern Shaanxi to pursue and intercept Li Xiannian's New Fourth Army. Suddenly, I received an urgent order to come to the north and quickly enter the area east of Kaocheng to fight the Liberated Area. Starting from August 27th and 28th, we began contact. From September 3rd to 6th, we fought fiercely with the Eighth Route Army in the Da Huangji, Tianye Temple, and Da Lizhai areas on the border of Kaocheng and Heze. The officers and soldiers suffered heavy casualties. Unfortunately, the entire Third Division was surrounded and destroyed, and the 47th Division also suffered the same disastrous defeat. I and the personnel of the division headquarters were unfortunately captured. Thinking about it, I feel ashamed and pained!

　　Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army can still treat us as friends. The officers and soldiers of the Third and 47th Divisions here are treated very well, whether it is in terms of daily life, food, or drink, and are not insulted in any way. The wounded have been treated. "Lay down your weapons and become friends!" is the slogan and action of the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army. This is indeed beyond what we expected.

　　In the past, some of you were my fellow villagers, classmates, or colleagues. Upon hearing the news of Xitian's capture, you must be worried about Xitian. However, according to the responsible commander here, if peace is achieved and the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is adjusted, it will not be difficult to return to the rear. Judging from the release of Mr. Ma Gengyu (Fa Wu), I also believe it is not false. This can be a comfort to you.

　　Since I came here, I have repeatedly thought about what I heard before and what I have personally experienced here. I wondered why the Eighth Route Army can persist behind enemy lines for eight years, and why the people can support the Communist Party so much. If they were just wandering around without fighting or simply deceiving people, why could they last so long? Their troops would have lost their fighting power long ago. However, what the Third Division encountered this time was not a defeat at the first blow, but a tenacious resistance. The bravery of its officers and soldiers and the strength of its firepower were beyond our imagination. As for their spirit of bayonet fighting, if it had not been tempered by eight years of fighting against the Japanese invaders, it would not have reached this level. Especially the unity of the military and the people, and the unity of the people, would be difficult to achieve without appropriate and good policies. These are issues that we should all think deeply about. According to my observation, the CCP is also sincere about peace and democracy. For issues such as restoring transportation and reorganization, if we can adhere to political methods, we may be able to find a solution. Resorting to force will naturally complicate the issue. Therefore, I hope that we can still adhere to the principle of political resolution, which is a blessing for the country and the people. Otherwise, after eight years of resistance against Japan, if we continue with a civil war, the suffering of the people will be endless. What do you think?

　　Furthermore, my home is in Lianshui County in the New Fourth Army area of northern Jiangsu. According to letters from my family, the New Fourth Army can take care of my family and relatives. My nephew is a company commander in the New Fourth Army. Although he is young, he is very pure and kind, and only does this to resist Japan and protect his hometown. It seems inappropriate to blame him any further, and of course, I don't want to see him again on the battlefield. Therefore, after thinking about it again and again in recent days, I feel that being a soldier is a dangerous path, and I really don't want to put myself in this contradictory and upside-down situation again. I only hope to disarm and return to my hometown to farm in the future!

　　The above is a little of my recent thoughts. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope you will correct me.

　　Zhao Xitian, September 13th

　　赵锡田师长
    函致蒋军官兵反对内战
    【本报讯】整三师师长赵锡田，顷致函蒋军官兵，说明在八路军备受优待情况，及此次罢战经过与今后政见，兹将原函发表如下：
    国民党军各军、师、旅、团官长、弟兄们：
    本人此次率第三师从鄂西陕南边境追击堵截新四军李先念部，忽奉命急迫开来北方，迅速进入考城以东地区来打解放区，从八月二十七、八日起开始接触，九月三日至六日与八路军激战于考城、荷泽边境之大黄集、天爷庙、大李寨一带，官兵伤亡惨重，不幸第三师全部陷于包围中而遭覆灭，四十七师亦随之同遭惨败。本人及师部人员终不幸被俘，思之不胜惭愧与痛心！
    所可幸者：八路军官兵仍尚能以朋友相待，本人及三师、四十七师在此之官兵，无论起居饮食，均招待甚周，毫未加以侮辱，负伤的都曾给以医治。“放下武器，即为朋友！”为八路军官兵中之口号与行动，此诚出乎吾人前所预料也。
    诸君过去与本人或为同乡，或为同学，或系同事，闻锡田此次被俘消息，必替锡田忧虑，惟据此方负责长官所云；俟大局和平，国共关系调整，仍不难重返后方。证诸马耕虞（法五）先生释放事，余亦信其非虚，此可告慰于诸君者。
    本人来此以后，日来曾将以前所闻，及在此亲身经历者几度思虑，心想八路军为什么能在敌后坚持八年，人民为什么能如此拥护共产党，如果游而不击与全是欺骗为什么能持久？其部队更会早已消失战斗力，但此次三师所遭遇的并非一击即溃，而是顽强抵抗，其官兵之英勇其火力之强，均非吾人所能设想，至于其白刃扑搏之精神，如非八年与日寇作战锻炼，必不至此。尤以军民一致，万众一心，如无适当的良好的政策，必难办到。这些问题都应使吾人去深思。中共对于和平、民主，据余观察亦具诚意；对于恢复交通、整编等问题，如能坚持政治方式，未始不可以得到解决；诉诸武力，当然问题就复杂了。所以本人希望仍能本着政治解决之方针，才是国家与人民之福，否则，八年抗战之后，再继以内战，人民痛苦不知伊于胡底？诸君以为然否？
    再者，本人家在苏北新四军区域涟水县，据家中来信称：新四军对于家乡亲族尚能予以照顾，舍侄并在新四军任连长，伊虽年轻，但甚纯良，仅为抗日保家乡而出此，于公于私，似不宜再有所责难，当然更不愿再与彼兵戎相见也。因此本人近日来再四思维，颇感侧身戎行为畏途，实不愿再陷此身于矛盾颠倒之中，只求将来解甲还乡耕田足矣！
    以上是本人最近的一点感想，是否有当，甚望有以指正。
                赵锡田  九月十三日启
