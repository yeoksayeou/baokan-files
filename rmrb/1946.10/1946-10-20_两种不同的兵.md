　　Two Different Kinds of Soldiers
    Ji Lu Yu Frontline Reporter Group
    After the victory of the self-defense counterattack, the 6th company, 2nd platoon of the "He Zheng" regiment of × unit, received some new soldiers. One group consisted of new recruits who enlisted in the Liberated Area, and the other consisted of new recruits who had just been liberated during the self-defense counterattack. To promote mutual understanding and unity among the soldiers, the platoon leader convened a discussion meeting. The first to speak was Luo Yanwu, a soldier from the KMT's reorganized 3rd division who had just been liberated. His home was in Sichuan, and he was conscripted by Chiang Kai-shek. He said, "This time Chiang Kai-shek sent us to fight in the civil war, and none of us wanted to come. Now that I've come to the Liberated Area and joined the Eighth Route Army, I am determined to do a good job. Being in the Eighth Route Army offers a bright future and enjoys the support of the people, while the Central Army only wants our lives."
    袁宏信 Yuan Hongxin was also from Sichuan and was a soldier in the KMT's 47th division. He said, "I have three brothers. My second brother was drafted into the army long ago. I went out to do business and was captured twice, serving as a soldier for three months before deserting. Later, they broke down my door at night with guns and knives and tied me up with rope. Because my family was poor and couldn't afford a ransom, the Bao-chief had to drag me away." Yuan Hongxin then recounted how one of his brothers married a wife, and right after the wedding, before even entering the bridal chamber, he was taken away. He said indignantly, "The Sichuan people have a saying: 'Children belong to old Chiang, money belongs to the Bao-chief, and soldiers belong to the squad leader.' This is absolutely true. This time, we were transferred north for several months without pay. When we came to fight the Eighth Route Army, they said we were fighting 'bandits,' using only deception."
    曹风林 Cao Fenglin said, "I was also captured by Chiang Kai-shek and forced to be a soldier. At the division headquarters, I did nothing but push manure and haul earth, eating only a two-tael bun per meal, with no water to drink. Those who died were dragged outside the temple to feed the dogs. More than two hundred died in three months. Later, I was sent to the 40th Army. When the Japanese occupied Luoyang, they fled in terror. I ran home, but before a few days had passed, I was captured again by the 41st Army. This time heading north, who wanted to fight? Everyone wanted to go home, to become prisoners of the Eighth Route Army. Since arriving here, the squad leader has been very good to me, and I am very happy."
    Next, Wang Xiandong, a new recruit who enlisted in the Liberated Area, said, "At home, I was the chairman of the farmers' association, leading my village to turn over and overthrow the local tyrants and landlords. Just as we were getting our heads up, we heard that old Chiang was attacking us again, trying to take away our rice bowls. I was furious and signed up to join the army to fight old Chiang. Eight people from my village came with me at once. Eight large sedan chairs carried us to the district office. The district chief shook our hands and poured water for us, and the county magistrate poured wine for us. Now that I'm in the army, I'm determined not to go home until old Chiang is driven away." Yang Baoqing said, "I have a wife and two children. When I heard that Chiang Kai-shek was going to take away our rice bowls, I volunteered to join the army. The village carried flower sedan chairs, dressed us in red, and sent us off with gongs and drums, just like getting married. How glorious that is! The village cadres take care of the work at home. When we arrived at the district and county offices, the district chief and county magistrate poured wine and tea for us. See how much more glorious this is than the KMT army!"
    Finally, the entire platoon was very excited. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to unite as one, defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and strive for peace and democracy and complete liberation.

　　两种不同的兵
    冀鲁豫前线记者团
    “和政”部×团六连二排在自卫反击胜利后，增加了一部分新战士，一种是解放区参军的新战士，一种是在自卫反击战斗中刚被解放出来的新战士。为了使战士们互相了解与互相团结起见，由排长召开了一个座谈会。首先发言的是刚被解放的蒋军整三师的战士罗彦梧，他的家在四川，是被蒋介石征兵征来的。他说：“这次蒋介石调我们来打内战，我们都不愿意来。现在到了解放区参加八路军，我决心好好干，当八路军前途光明，受人民拥护，中央军是光要咱们的命。”
    袁宏信也是四川人，为蒋军四十七师战士，他说：“我有弟兄三个，二弟早被抓去当了兵，我出去做生意被抓去两次，当了三个月的兵，就开了小差。后来他们在夜里用枪刀打烂我家的门，把我用绳捆起来。因为家穷，赎不起，只得被保长拉走了。”接着袁宏信又叙述他的一个兄弟娶了个媳妇，刚喝了喜酒，还没进洞房，就被抓走了。他愤慨的说：“四川老百姓有一句话是‘有了孩子是老蒋的，有了钱是保长的，当了兵是班长的。’这话一点也不错。这次向北调好几个月没发饷，来打八路军说是打‘土匪’，全用欺骗办法。”
    曹风林说：“我也是被蒋介石捉来当兵的，到师管区光推粪拉土，一顿只吃二两重的一个馒头，又没水喝。死了便拉到庙外喂狗。三个月里死了二百多。后来就被送到四十军，日本一占洛阳就吓跑了。我跑回家不到几天，又被四十一军抓去，这次北上，谁还愿打呢？都想回家，想当八路军的俘虏。来到这里以后，班长对我很好，我很高兴。
    接着解放区参军的新战士，王现东说：“我在家是农会长，领导俺庄翻了身，把恶霸地主斗垮了。刚说抬了头，听说老蒋又进攻咱，要夺咱的饭碗。我气坏了，就报名参了军，和老蒋拚。我村一下子跟我来了八个人，八乘大轿送我们到区署，区长拉着手给倒水，县长给斟酒，现在到了部队里，决心不打走老蒋不回家。”杨保清说：“我家有个媳妇，两个小孩，听说蒋介石要来夺咱的饭碗，我就自动报名参军了。村里抬着花轿披红挂花，打着锣鼓送咱像娶媳妇一样，看多光荣。家里的活有村干部照顾。到了区里县里，区长县长给倒酒倒茶，你看这比蒋军光荣多少倍呀！”
    最后，全排非常兴奋，大家一致表示要团结成一条心，打败蒋介石的进攻，争取和平民主，彻底翻身。
