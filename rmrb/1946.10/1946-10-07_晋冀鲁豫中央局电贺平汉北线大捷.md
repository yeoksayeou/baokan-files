[Dispatch from this newspaper in Handan on the 5th] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau sent a telegram to Commander Nie congratulating him on the great victory in the self-defense counterattack on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, stating:

　　Zhangjiakou, Commander Nie, Deputy Political Commissars Liu and Luo, and all commanders and fighters on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway: Your brilliant victory in the self-defense counterattack on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway has not only dealt a heavy blow to the Kuomintang army's arrogant attempt to attack Zhangjiakou, but also effectively coordinated with our area's effort to crush Chiang Kai-shek's new offensive to open up the north and south sections of the Ping-Han Railway. The self-defense soldiers and civilians in our entire area are extremely excited. We hereby send a telegram to express our congratulations.
                Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau, October 5th
