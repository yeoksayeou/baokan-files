　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: On the fourth day of the "US Military Withdrawal from China Movement Week" – Rural Activity Day – peasants in the rural areas near Yan'an spontaneously gathered for current affairs discussions and responded to the call of the conference by intensifying the autumn harvest and military training. In these days of civil war, they were reminded of the history of their liberation and became even more invigorated and vigilant. Zhou Mingliang from Yuhua Township in the eastern suburbs said, "Before the revolution, there were only thirteen poor families in our village. Now, every family has cattle and sheep filling the pens, and grain piled high. The number of households has also increased by forty-four. Who wants to let Chiang Kai-shek take away such a good life!" Farmer Liu Zhiwen said, "Chiang Kai-shek can't even move without his American foreign daddy! It's those bad guys who are supporting him and handing him the knife!" Li Cheng, a noodle maker, told everyone, "Chiang Kai-shek has sold out our 'territorial waters, inland rivers, shipping,' and even our 'airspace'! We, the common people, must beat the traitor to death!" At the village meeting in Houjiagou, Zaoyuan Township, village head Shi Zaisheng and villager Zeng Changde advocated eating two meals a day and mending old clothes for the winter, calling on the whole village to live frugally and donate more grain to support the front lines. Farmers Liu Manmiao and Qiu Peng from the New Market said, "Harvesting more grain is also defending the Border Region." They have already donated three dan of grain and are now working to prepare fertilizer for a bigger harvest next year. The folks in Dengjiagou compared the Kuomintang reactionaries to dark clouds before hail, urging villagers to quickly prepare homemade guns and cannons to disperse the dark clouds. The spears of the Wu Manyou Township self-defense forces have all been lengthened to one and a half feet. Yesterday, the entire village of Zhao Jiayaozi still braved the rain to go up the mountain and rush the harvest. At yesterday's village meeting in Liulinzi, Wu Xianggui proposed "organizing a guerrilla team to deal with Chiang Kai-shek's army."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 14th: Yesterday was the fourth day of the "US Military Withdrawal from China Movement Week" here. Fifty thousand people gathered and shouted, "The people of Northeast China resolutely oppose US imperialism aiding Chiang in the civil war!" and "Drive the US troops stationed in China out!" When the US personnel of the Thirty-Sixth Executive Group entered the venue, the passionate slogans of the masses showed them the enthusiasm and will of the Chinese people to defend their motherland. US Captain Lang stated, "We are willing to return home as soon as possible." The conference passed a telegram to the United Nations, demanding the rapid withdrawal of the unreasonably stationed US troops in China. Immediately afterwards, a demonstration parade was held, stretching for ten li, with 50,000 marchers showing fierce anger. When the procession reached the residence of the Thirty-Sixth Executive Group, a group of female workers from the Railway Bureau rushed to the gate, shouting, "We vow never to be slaves of a subjugated nation! Down with the US-Chiang reactionaries! Let us live a good life!"
