　　[This news was] Reported from Yangcheng on the 26th [of October] by Our Newspaper. The people of Tunliu are filled with bitter resentment towards the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous attacks and are actively and voluntarily requesting to join the war. The first batch of militia rotation teams and stretcher transport teams departed on the 10th of this month. Before leaving, the militia members of the Yuan Village rotation team went to see the director of the Armed Forces Committee and solemnly said, "When the next batch of people is sent to the front line, please do not call us back under any circumstances. We must persevere to the end and will not return until the attacking Chiang troops are eliminated!" Jia Gouze, a militiaman from Guanzhuang, was about to get married, but his brother, Jia Longyuan, left with the rotation team and told him to stay at home. He said, "Why rush to get married? This isn't the time!" He insisted on going. When the stretcher team transport team was about to leave, Yang Zhenchang, who only had one eye, repeatedly requested to participate. After being dissuaded by the villagers, he said, "You go ahead, I will be responsible for the autumn harvest, and I will take care of the home!" Before the team even set off, the men, women, and children in the village had already divided up the work. The girls went to the fields to cut grain, the boys went to the fields to pull corn, and the military dependents also competed to be the first to set an example. When Lu Guixin left, he put on new cotton clothes and also brought a pair of cotton shoes. He said, "I'm preparing winter clothes. No matter how long the fight lasts, I will do it for that long." Many village cadres ran to the assembly point to see them off, and the militia members excitedly said, "Please go back, we will definitely bring you back American guns!"

    【本报阳城二十六日电】屯留人民痛愤汉奸蒋介石的卖国进攻，纷纷自动请求参战，首批民兵轮战队及担架运输队已于本月十日出发。原村参加轮战队的民兵临行前去见武委会主任，郑重的说：“下一批上前线人派出时，无论如何请你不要调我们回来，我们一定要坚持到底，不消灭进攻的蒋军是不回来的！”官庄民兵贾狗则，就要娶媳妇了，他哥贾龙元随轮战队出发叫他留在家里，他说：“娶媳妇何必忙，在这时候不啦！”他非去不行。担架队运输队出发时，路村一只眼的杨振昌一再要求参加，经村人劝阻后，他说：“你们去吧，秋收有我负责，家里有我照应！”队伍还没出发，村里男女儿童已分好了工，女孩去场里切谷，男孩去地拔玉茭，军属妇女亦争着打先锋。芦贵新临走时穿上新棉衣，还带上一双棉鞋，他说：“准备好冬衣，要打多久，我就干多久。”许多村干跑到集合地点去送他们，民兵兴奋的说：“请回去吧，咱们一定给你们捎美国枪回来！”
