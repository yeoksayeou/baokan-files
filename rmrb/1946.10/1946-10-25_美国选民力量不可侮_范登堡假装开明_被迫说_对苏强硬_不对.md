　　American Voters' Power is Not to Be Insulted
    Vandenberg Pretends to Be Enlightened
    Forced to Say "Getting Tough on the Soviets" is Wrong
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 22nd: Byrnes's speech on US-Soviet relations on the 18th came on the eve of the US congressional elections. The American people were dissatisfied with the so-called "getting tough on the Soviets" policy promoted by Vandenberg and Byrnes at the Paris Peace Conference, which had already failed, and demanded a return to Roosevelt's foreign policy. Stalin's interview with British journalists aroused strong sympathy from people around the world, including Americans, so that Byrnes, in his speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris on the 3rd of this month, had to express agreement with Stalin's statement that he "does not believe in the real danger of a new war." The day after Byrnes's speech, the 19th, Vandenberg, who manipulates American foreign policy, also made a statement. According to a Reuters report, Vandenberg said: "The Soviet Union does not want war, and the United States does not want war. I hope we stop talking about war." "We must not allow war with the Soviet Union to become inevitable." When Vandenberg was asked why the joint foreign policy of the Democratic and Republican parties was called a "getting tough on the Soviets" policy, Vandenberg said: "Wrong, it should be firm friendship." According to Byrnes's speech, he revealed that "we must retain our views," while Vandenberg attacked "domestic appeasers" (meaning those who are willing to adopt a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union) in his speech and advocated "complete frankness with the Soviet Union, talking about retaliation," which shows that although the US authorities, under the pressure of world opinion and the public will of the American people, have changed the name of the "getting tough on the Soviets policy" to "firm friendship," there will still be fierce disputes during the four foreign ministers' discussion of the final text of the five-nation treaty in New York and at the United Nations General Assembly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 22nd: According to Agence France-Presse, New York, October 20th: Fifty-two veteran squatters, who have occupied the Senate mansion in the capital of New York State for a long time, passed a proposal stating: They will continue to occupy the Senate until Governor Dewey guarantees that a special session of the New York State Legislature will be held to discuss the issue of homeless veterans, and guarantees them housing. Governor Dewey (a reactionary Republican leader) rejected this request and instead asked the veterans to make a decision on their course of action. After receiving Dewey's reply, the veterans left the parliament. As they left, they said: They have decided to vote against Dewey in the next election (note: and against Dewey's election as governor is Democratic Senator Mead).

　　美国选民力量不可侮
    范登堡假装开明
    被迫说“对苏强硬”不对
    【新华社延安二十二日电】贝纳斯十八日关于美苏关系的演说，适在美国国会改选之前夕，美国人民不满意范登堡——贝纳斯在巴黎和会所推行的并已遭到失败的所谓“对苏强硬政策”，要求恢复罗斯福的外交政策。斯大林的对英记者谈话，引起世界人士包括美国人士有力的同情，以致贝纳斯本月三日在巴黎美侨总会演说时，亦不得不表示同意斯大林所称“不相信新战争的实际危险”。在贝纳斯这次演说后一天，即十九日，操纵美国外交政策的范登堡亦发表谈话。据路透社记者报导，范氏称：“苏联不愿战争，美国亦不愿战争，我希望我们停止战争的谈论”。“必须不让对苏战争变成不免的东西”。当范氏被询及为什么民主党与共和党的联合外交政策叫做“对苏强硬”政策时，范氏称：“不对，应为坚定的友谊”。按贝纳斯演说中，暴露“必须保留我们的观点”，而范登堡则在谈话中攻击“国内的绥靖主义者”（按：即指愿意对苏采取友好政策者），并主张什么“对苏联完全坦白，讲什么报复什么”，这显示美国当局虽在世界舆论和美国人民公意压力下，把“对苏强硬政策”改称“坚定的友谊”，但在四外长在纽约讨论五国和约最后正文时及在联合国大会中，还会有一番剧烈争执。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据法新闻处纽约二十日讯：五十二个退伍军人抢居者，他们已占据纽约州首府参院宅邸多时，并通过建议称：他们将继续占据参院，直至杜威州长保证纽约州议会特别会议专门讨论无家可归之退伍军人问题，并保证给他们房子住为止。该州州长杜威（共和党反动领袖）拒绝此项要求，反而要求退伍军人对他们的行动方针立作决定。退伍军人得到杜威答复后，即离议会。当离开时，他们说：他们已决定在下次大选中，投票反对杜威（按：与对杜威竞选州长者为民主党参议员米德）。
