　　Chiang Kai-shek's Frenzied Civil War Leads to Financial Deficit
    Shanghai's Printing Industry Thrives Alone
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: Shanghai News: According to estimates from the Wenhui Daily here, the Chiang government's monthly financial expenditure reached around 1 trillion yuan in July and August. The Chiang government possesses approximately 3 million troops in the army, navy, and air force. Based on the adjusted salary standards in July, a single army division of 12,000 men requires a regular monthly expenditure of 120 million yuan. With 250 divisions nationwide, this amounts to a total salary expenditure of 300 billion yuan. If the supplies for the navy and air force average 2.5 times that of the army, then the salaries for 800,000 personnel should be 210 billion yuan per month. Moreover, troop transportation and combat expenses are not included in this figure.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: The Kuomintang authorities are frantically issuing more currency to pay for the enormous civil war expenditure, in order to make up for the alarming financial deficit. According to the Shanghai United Evening News on the 17th, the Shanghai branch of the Central Printing Factory, affiliated with the Ministry of Finance alone, produces 23.04 billion yuan of legal tender and Northeast circulating currency daily, averaging 16 million yuan per minute, with a monthly output of over 70 trillion yuan. Due to the flourishing business, the Shanghai branch has recently added a new factory to its original four. Dozens of large currency printing machines in each factory operate without a minute's rest, and the staff and workers have been working day and night shifts, but the demand is still not being met. Therefore, the authorities have ordered new-style currency printing machines from the United States, which are being shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). It is reported that the factory is now printing large denomination notes of 1,000 yuan each, and notes below 1,000 yuan have long been discontinued. The general public believes that, amidst the depression of all industries, the currency printing industry alone is showing abnormal prosperity, no wonder prices are soaring and the people are suffering!

　　蒋介石疯狂内战财政支绌
    沪印钞业独呈繁荣
    【新华社延安二十三日电】沪讯：据此间文汇报估计，七八两月间蒋政府每月财政支出达一万亿元左右，蒋政府拥有海陆空军约三百万人，如根据七月间调整后的薪饷标准计算，陆军一师一万二千人，每月经常费用即需十二万万元之谱。全国以二百五十师计，即需薪饷三千亿元。如海空军的给养平均为陆军的二倍半，则八十万人的薪饷每月应为二千一百亿元。此外军队的输送及作战费用犹不在内。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】国民党当局为支付庞大的内战军费，正疯狂增发通货，以弥补惊人的财政赤字。据十七日沪联合晚报透露，仅财政部所属中央印制厂上海分厂，每日所产之法币与东北流通券即达二百三十亿另四千万元，平均每分钟出产一千六百万元，每月产量为七千万万元以上。该上分厂因业务发达，除原有四厂外，最近又增设一新厂，各厂数十部印钞大机器从无一分钟休息，职员工人均加开日夜班，但还感供不应求。因此当局向美订购之新式印钞机，正由联总源源赶运来沪。据息现该厂所印法币均系千元一张之大钞，千元以下者早已停印。一般人士认为，值此百业萧条声中，钞票印刷业独呈畸形繁荣，何怪百物飞涨，民不聊生！
