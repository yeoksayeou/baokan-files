　　Congratulations on the Good Harvest in the Liberated Areas—Editorial of the Liberation Daily
    The autumn harvest in various liberated areas has been bountiful, with many regions experiencing the best yields in decades. This good harvest provides a strong material guarantee for the people's self-defense war in the liberated areas.

    The widespread good harvests and the people's well-being in the liberated areas stand in stark contrast to the widespread disasters and the people's suffering in the KMT-controlled areas. The oligarchic dictatorial government in the Kuomintang areas only knows how to seek personal gain and fatten itself, only knows how to demand taxes, grain, and levies from the people, creating disasters. In contrast, the liberated areas are under the administration of a democratic government, a government of the people themselves, whose policies, laws, and administrative measures are all aimed at benefiting the people, closely concerning themselves with the people's basic needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Especially after the implementation of the land policy of "land to the tiller" through rent reduction and liquidation, the vast number of peasants were liberated from the shackles of thousands of years of feudal exploitation. Poor peasants, who for generations had shed blood and sweat on other people's land and produced for others, have now obtained land. When they cultivate their own land for themselves, they unleash unparalleled labor enthusiasm, and actively organize mutual aid in production. Many peasants who have received land are so happy that they cannot sleep at night, running to see their land and caressing their crops. Many peasants in areas where rent reduction has been implemented have increased their income, enabling them to buy land and cattle to expand production, and they also display great production enthusiasm. Moreover, they live in the democratic and free liberated areas, where the democratic government not only greatly reduces their burden but also encourages and helps them in production both spiritually and materially. Local democratic governments have successively issued large amounts of low-interest agricultural loans; for example, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government issued 80,000 million yuan in agricultural loans to help peasants solve difficulties in plowing cattle, farm tools, fertilizer, and seeds. The government has also devoted great efforts to mobilizing the masses to organize labor mutual aid, improving annual production efficiency, and leading peasants in intensive farming and water conservancy to improve agricultural technology and increase grain income. For example, in the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area, under the leadership of the government, the construction of water conservancy projects has resulted in the addition and restoration of more than 4 million mu of paddy fields; the harvest from these paddy fields is one to several times higher than that of ordinary land. In short, the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas rely on their own hands and hard work, rely on the leadership of their own democratic government and organizations to carry out large-scale production movements, and harvest grain and cotton from their own land to achieve self-sufficiency in food and clothing.

    Now that the autumn harvest has been largely completed in various places, the current task is how to cherish and preserve the fruits of this good harvest, so that we can enjoy them ourselves, improve people's livelihood, and supply the needs of the front lines. Therefore, the following work must be carried out immediately: (1) We must thresh and store the grain quickly. Launch a widespread mass struggle against grain seizure, and strictly prevent the reactionaries from plundering the fruits of our autumn harvest. Bringing the crops to the threshing ground is only half the harvest; we must quickly organize labor to rush threshing, and then store the grain securely. Especially in marginal areas, grain should be quickly transported to the safe rear, and when the enemy arrives, a scorched earth policy should be implemented. As the Taiyue Liberated Area did, they organized 100,000 people to transport the grain from the marginal areas back to the safe rear, so that the enemy could not seize a single grain. Our warehouses must be dispersed, and it is best to mobilize the masses to secretly store grain themselves as individual households to prevent the reactionaries from looting. In areas of intense struggle, the means of transportation such as mules, horses and carts should be transferred to the mountains, as the masses in the Jinzhong Plain area did, so that even if the invading army seizes some grain, it cannot be transported away. The militia and guerrillas should regard protecting the people's grain as their top priority. The militia self-defense forces can organize mutual aid in autumn harvesting with the masses, approaching the enemy to guard and watch, and covering the threshing and storage in the village. If the grain has been seized by the enemy, the militia and guerrillas must try every means to recapture the grain and return it to the masses. We must resolutely resist the enemy's purchase of grain; the government must be good at controlling and organizing trade, supplying the people with daily necessities, so that the people's food will not be seized by the Chiang Kai-shek faction. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we accumulated rich experience in the grain struggle, much of which can still be applied today, and we should promote these good experiences. (2) We must cherish grain and prevent all waste and loss. We should take good care of it, regularly check and sun the grain, and prevent it from rotting and being stolen by rats and birds. Diligent and dedicated warehouse keepers should be commended and rewarded; those who are irresponsible should be urged and criticized. A widespread conservation movement should be launched among the masses, and we should not only see today and not see tomorrow, and we should not eat and drink excessively because of the good harvest, and we should not allow the grain earned by blood and sweat to be wasted in vain. (3) While celebrating the harvest, all localities should call on and organize the people to step up preparations for winter production, such as accumulating manure and making fertilizer, repairing farm tools, and preparing to launch a major production campaign next year to strive for another good harvest next year.

　　祝解放区丰收——解放日报社论
    解放区各地秋收丰登，许多地区收成之佳，为数十年来所未有。这一丰收对于解放区人民的自卫战争，提供了有力的物质保证。
    解放区的到处丰收，民生康乐，与蒋管区的遍地灾荒，民不聊生，适成显明的对照。国民党区的寡头独裁政府，只知营私肥己，只知向老百姓要丁要粮要赋，制造灾荒；而解放区则是在民主政府管理之下，这是人民自己的政府，它的一切政策法令和行政设施，均以为民谋利为宗旨，亲切关心人民的衣食住行问题。特别由于经过减租清算，实行了耕者有其田的土地政策，使广大农民从几千年封建剥削的牢笼里解放出来。多少年代流血流汗在别人土地上，为别人生产的贫苦农民，现在获得了土地。当他们在自己的土地上为自己耕作的时候，他们发挥了无比的劳动热情，纷纷组织互助生产，许多分得土地的农民，欣喜得半夜里睡不着觉，跑去看自己的地，抚爱着自己的庄稼。许多经过减租地区的农民，由于收入的增加，使他们可以买地买牛扩大生产，也同样发挥了极大的生产热情。加之他们生活在民主自由的解放区，民主政府不但大大的减轻了他们的负担，而且从精神和物质上鼓励和帮助他们生产。各地民主政府都先后发放了大批的低利农业贷款，如晋冀鲁豫边府即发放农贷八万万元，帮助农民解决耕牛农具肥料种籽等困难。政府又用很大的力量发动群众组织劳动互助，提高了年产效率，领导农民精耕细作、兴修水利，以改良农业技术而增加粮食收入。如晋察冀解放区，在政府领导之下，兴修水利的结果，新增及恢复水田四百余万亩；此种水田之收获，皆较普通地多收一倍至数倍。总之，解放区的军民是依靠自己的双手和勤劳，依靠自己的民主政府和团体的领导开展大规模生产运动，从自己的土地里收获粮食和棉花，达到丰衣足食。
    现在各地秋收已经大体完成，当前的工作在于如何爱惜和保存这些丰收的果实，使之为我们自己享受，用以改善民生和供应前线的需要。因此，必须立即进行下列工作：（一）必须快打快藏。发动广泛的群众反抢粮斗争，严防反动派抢夺我们秋收的果实。庄稼收到场里，只等于收获了一半，必须迅速组织劳动力赶打，然后将粮食严密的储藏起来。特别是边缘地区，应迅速将粮食运往安全的后方，敌人到时实行坚壁清野。如太岳解放区所做的一样，他们组织了十万群众，把边缘区的粮食运回安全的后方，不使敌人抢到一颗粮食。我们的仓库必须分散，最好发动群众以家庭为单位自行秘密收藏，以防反动派抢劫。在斗争紧张的地区，应该如晋中平川地区的群众那样，将骡马大车等运输工具，转移到山地，使进犯军即使抢到几颗粮食，也无法运走。民兵游击队，应将保卫群众粮食，当作自己之头等重要任务。民兵自卫队，可与群众之间组织秋收的变工，接近敌人警戒放哨，掩护村内打场收藏。万一粮食已被敌人抢去，民兵游击队要想尽办法，夺回粮食发还群众。对于敌人的收买粮食，要予严厉抵制；政府要善于掌握与组织贸易，供应人民日常生活必需品，使人民食粮不致为蒋方所夺取。八年抗战，在粮食斗争方面，我们曾积累了丰富经验，今天许多仍可应用，应该把这些良好的经验加以推广。（二）必须万分爱护粮食，防止一切浪费和损耗。应好好照管，经常检查和晒场，不使粮食霉烂及鼠雀偷食。对于勤劳奉公的仓库保管员，应加以表扬奖励；对于不负责任的，应加督促和批评。在群众中要展开一个广泛的节约运动，不要只看到今天不看到明天，不要因为收成好而大吃大喝，不要使血汗换来的粮食受到一点无谓的浪费。（三）各地在庆祝丰收之际，应号召和组织人民，加紧进行冬季生产准备工作，如积粪造肥修理农具，准备开展明年的大生产运动，争取来年又一个丰收。
