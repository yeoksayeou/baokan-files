　　Trade Deficit!
    Cotton Tops List of Imports
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] Shanghai Dispatch: According to figures released by the Shanghai Customs, the total value of Shanghai's imports in August was 11.8 million yuan. This is an increase of 2.4 million yuan compared to July. This does not include the large amount of smuggled imports. Exports were only 4.97 million yuan. Although this is higher than the previous seven months, it still only accounts for 30 percent of imports, with the trade deficit reaching 6.82 million yuan. The main export goods are bristles, tung oil, silk, and leather. Tea, which used to be China's main export commodity, is only worth 1.3 million yuan, ranking eleventh among exports. Cotton, which was one of China's important export commodities before the war, is now the number one import. Other imported goods include chemical products, cotton cloth, and paper. The "imported machinery" exaggerated by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda organs is actually only worth 440,000 yuan, accounting for 4 percent of imports.

　　入超！
    进口货物中棉花占首位
    【新华社延安十五日电】沪讯：据上海海关公布数字，八月份上海进口总值为一千一百八十万万元。又较七月份增加二百四十万万元。大量的走私进口，还不在内。出口仅四百九十七万万元。虽较以往七个月增高了，但仍只占进口百分之三十，入超仍达六百八十二万万元。出口货以猪鬃、桐油、丝、皮革为多，向为我国主要出口货物的茶叶仅值十三万万余元，退居出口之第十一位。战前为我国重要出口货物之一的棉花，现在却成为进口之第一位。其余的进口货则为化学产品、棉布、纸张等。蒋介石宣传机关所夸张的“进口机器”，实际只值四十四万万元，占进口百分之四。
