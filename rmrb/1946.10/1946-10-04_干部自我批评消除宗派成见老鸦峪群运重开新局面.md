　　【Benbao Cixian Xun】Cixian Fourth District Laoyayu Village, through self-criticism by cadres, has unified its own strength and launched a liquidation struggle against local bullies and landlords. The work has made significant progress. In the past, the masses of Laoyayu had some mobilization, but this year the movement has been sluggish. Recent inspections revealed that under the various instigations of the local bullies and landlords, sectarianism and disunity existed between the east and west streets, outsiders and locals, and the farmers' association and the workers' union. The village cadres' vigilance was low, and they were also drawn into the sectarian vortex. The chairman of the farmers' association even shielded the landlords, thus separating himself from the masses. In order to change the situation in the village, the district cadres fully mobilized the masses and first convened a cadre meeting to encourage everyone to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism. Over two nights, most of the cadres made profound self-examinations, and finally unanimously vowed to no longer engage in sectarianism, not to shield landlords, not to be instigated by them, to discuss matters with the masses, not to substitute or take over, and to truly mobilize the masses from an ideological point of view to struggle for liberation. After the meeting, the cadres unanimously expressed their desire to strive to "be the locomotive," all going deep into the broad masses to educate them, break the past sectarian emotions, and immediately discovered that the majority of the masses urgently demanded to settle accounts with the local bully Wang Daqi and recover the grain payments owed to the masses by four or five local bullies and landlords. After a few days of deliberation, the liquidation struggle against Wang Daqi was launched. The masses' accusations and grievances were more thorough than ever before, resolutely forcing Wang Daqi to bow his head and admit his mistakes. Then, the old Xi and old scholars, who used to rule and instigate the masses, were overthrown, and the grain payments they had accumulated were recovered. The masses' emotions were unprecedentedly high, and they all demanded to join the farmers' association. The farmers' association grew from the original 191 people to 280 people. The most resolute fighters were elected as the new chairman of the farmers' association, and the number of activists increased from 43 to 46. The destructive activities of the local bullies and landlords have been restrained, and the masses of the whole village are united as never before. (Chai Yuefa)

　　干部自我批评消除宗派成见老鸦峪群运重开新局面
    【本报磁县讯】磁县四区老鸦峪村经过干部的自我批评，统一了自己力量，掀起对恶霸地主的清算斗争。工作获得重大进展。过去老鸦峪群众曾有过一些发动，今年运动却一直消沉。最近检查，发现该村在恶霸地主们进行各种挑拨下，使东街与西街，外来户与本地户，农会与工会，都存在着宗派思想与不团结现象。村干部警觉性低，也被卷入宗派漩涡。农会长且包庇地主，因而脱离群众。区干部为转变该村局面，全力发动群众，首先召集干部会，启发大家进行自我批评与互相批评。两夜的时间，多数干部都作了深刻的检讨，最后一致发誓不再闹宗派，不包庇地主，不受其挑拨，有事与群众商量，不代替包办，要真正从思想上发动群众起来斗争翻身。会后干部一致表示要争取“做火车头”，全部深入到广大群众中去，教育群众，打破过去的宗派情绪，当即发现大部群众迫切要求向恶霸王大旗清算，索还四、五户恶霸地主拖欠群众的粮款。经过几天酝酿，对王大旗的清算斗争展开了。群众诉苦申冤比以往任何一次都彻底，坚决迫使王大旗不得不低头认错。接着又斗倒了过去统治与挑拨群众的老西、老秀才等，索还了他们积欠的粮款。群众情绪空前高涨，纷纷要求加入农会。农会从原来的一九一人发展到二百八十人。选出斗争最坚决的当新的农会长，积极分子四十三人增至四十六人。恶霸地主的破坏活动敛迹了，全村群众空前坚固的团结起来。（柴悦法）
