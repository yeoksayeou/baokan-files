Achievements Under the Peach Tree Shade

August 6th was the third day of the Battle of Baipo in Meng County. As the east was about to dawn, everything was still very quiet. Only the faint shadows of the soldiers on the surrounding positions could be seen moving back and forth busily. At this time, day was about to break.

The Second Battalion had accepted the task of attacking the West Taishen Temple in Yezhen Town. At that time, the only way to approach the temple was from the main street of Yezhen Town, but the enemy had built a nasty pillbox directly facing the street. Therefore, they had to break through the walls on both sides of the street to approach the enemy. At that time, the first platoon of the fourth company was responsible for opening this path. The soldiers moved with extremely quick and silent actions, and began digging communication trenches 80 meters away from the enemy. They connected four or five courtyards, and behind a lush peach tree, they discovered many Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in American-style uniforms, sitting there worrying, some pacing back and forth anxiously.

The forward scout Wang Jingming and platoon leader Zhao Jun discovered the enemy under the peach tree. The platoon leader quickly and swiftly moved the entire platoon behind the peach tree. At this time, Political Commissar Zhang also arrived. He said in a low voice: "Get these guys, then we can approach the temple. Everyone, get your grenades ready!" Then the platoon leader loudly issued the order to throw grenades. After a series of deafening explosions of "Boom! Boom! Boom!", dust and smoke filled the entire courtyard. The brave soldiers, holding their bright bayonets, plunged into the smoke, shouting the slogan "Those who surrender will not be killed!"

Suddenly, not a single enemy was seen in the courtyard. Mobile machine gunner Comrade Cao Yingui, holding his machine gun, shouted "Surrender and be spared!" at a large cave. Then everyone realized that the enemy had run into the cave.

This was the transportation company of the 51st Regiment of the stubborn army. Now they were all hiding in this cave. Amidst the chaotic shouts, a person called out at the entrance of the cave: "I am the company commander, and I am responsible for telling everyone to surrender. I know the Eighth Route Army does not kill prisoners. I surrendered to the Eighth Route Army before, and the Eighth Route Army even gave me travel expenses to go home." So he immediately ordered his troops to place all their weapons (four machine guns, more than fifty rifles) and other military supplies under the peach tree. None of them were injured, and the entire transportation company was liberated by us. (Zhang Yulong, Third and Fifth Regiments)

　　桃树荫下的战绩
    八月六日是孟县白坡战役进行的第三天。在东方将要发亮的时间，一切都还很沉静，只看见周围阵地上的将士们微微移动的暗影往返很忙，这时候天是快明了。
    二营这时接受了进攻冶戍镇西太山庙的任务，当时要想接近大庙，只有从冶戍镇大街去，但敌人早就正对着大街修着一个令人讨厌的碉堡，因此，只好从大街两侧打通屋壁接近敌人，当时四连一排负责开辟这条道路，战士们用着极其静速的动作，在距敌人八十公尺的地方，开始打交通壕，他们连通四五个院子，在一棵绿荫浓密的桃树后边，发现了许多身着美式服装的蒋军，在那里发愁的坐着，有的在来回急走。
    前边的搜索兵王精明与排长赵俊，发现了桃树下的敌人之后，排长轻快的脚步限迅速的将全排调到桃树后边，这时张政委也来了，他低声的说：“将这些家伙搞了，才能接近大庙，大家将手榴弹准备好！”接着排长大声发出投弹的口令，“轰！轰！轰！”的一阵震耳的巨声过后，灰土与浓烟弥漫了全院，英勇的战士们持着明亮亮的刺刀，向烟土中钻去，一面喊着“缴枪不杀”的口号。
    忽然院子里一个敌人都不见了，机动的机枪射手曹银贵同志端着机枪对着一个大窑洞，喊叫着“缴枪不杀”，于是大家才知道敌人跑到洞里了。
    这是顽军五十一团输送连，现在他们全都钻到这个洞里了。在乱七八糟的喊话声中，有一个人在洞口叫唤着说：“我是连长，我负责叫大家缴枪，我了解八路军不杀俘虏，我以前就缴过枪给八路军哩，八路军并发给我路费回家。”于是他立即命令他的部队，将所有武器（机枪四挺，五十多支步枪）及其他军用品统统放在桃树底下，他们之间一个也没负伤，完整的输送连被我们解放了。（三五团张裕龙）
