　　Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 3rd: The Eighth Route Army on the Pinghan Front continues its heroic advance, having successively liberated the two county towns of Dingxing and Rongcheng. Dingxing County was liberated at 4:30 PM on the 3rd, marking the third county town liberated since the Pinghan Self-Defense Counter-Offensive. More than 1,000 enemy troops of the puppet Liu Zusheng's unit, including the supply battalion, artillery company, machine gun company, communications team, and directly subordinate units of the military headquarters, who were defending the city, were completely annihilated, with no one escaping. Detailed battle results are currently being investigated. This bandit unit was originally a Japanese puppet security force, and was reorganized by the Kuomintang's 11th War Zone last autumn, still directly led by Kang Mufei, the deputy commander of the puppet security force, occupying Dingxing. They repeatedly harassed and encroached on the liberated areas, and the local people hated them to the bone. Dingxing is located between Xushui and Gaobeidian, with smooth transportation, and is one of the cities in the northern section of Pinghan. Rongcheng County was recovered by the Eighth Route Army at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, and more than 800 puppet troops and the puppet "Returning Home Corps" stationed in the city were completely annihilated. The city is located east of the Pinghan Road and is an important border area of the Central Hebei Liberated Area. It was liberated by the Eighth Route Army in August last autumn, but was later occupied by Chiang's puppets.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 2nd: The Eighth Route Army's self-defense counter-offensive on the Pinghan Front is still developing. Following the control of 250 miles of railway north and south of Baoding within 12 hours and the liberation of more than ten towns and stations such as Xushui and Wangdu, the northern section has also liberated Dingxing Station and surrounded Dingxing County. Yesterday (the 1st) afternoon, despite heavy rain, the front-line soldiers continued to clear the Chiang's puppet remnants at various points and lines according to the established combat plan, and took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce advance. In the battle to liberate Wangdu, the Eighth Route Army achieved the result of capturing more than 600 Chiang's puppet troops with only 30 casualties, creating a new combat record.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st (Delayed): After the news of the great victory of the Eighth Route Army's self-defense counter-offensive on the Pinghan Front reached here, the CCP Jin-Chahar-Hebei Central Bureau, the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Military Region, and the Border Region Government sent telegrams of commendation. The Border Region Government also sent Ke Qingshi, director of the Civil Affairs Department, with 20 million yuan to comfort the troops. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Central Bureau stated in a telegram: "In order to defend ourselves, to avenge ourselves, to protect the fruits of eight years of bloody struggle, to smash Chiang Kai-shek's mad attack, and to restore domestic peace, you have launched a major counter-offensive with unparalleled heroism against the Chiang's puppet troops on the Pinghan Line. This is a noble manifestation of the glorious essence of the revolutionary people and the people's army. We extend our great respect to you!" The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Military Region stated in a telegram: "We hope that you will make persistent efforts, continue to expand the results of the battle, and direct the sharp edge of victory straight to the heart of the Kuomintang reactionaries!" In a commentary, the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Daily praised the fact that the military and civilians on the Pinghan Line quickly retaliated 19 hours after Chiang's army began its attack on Zhangjiakou in Chahar, and achieved the brilliant results of controlling 250 miles of railway and liberating more than ten towns and military stations such as Xushui and Wangdu within 12 hours, calling on the military and civilians in the area to actively participate in the war and completely smash Chiang's army's offensive!

　　平汉北段反击战勇猛推进
    我军续克定兴容城
    歼伪还乡团及蒋伪军两千
    晋察冀首脑机关驰电嘉勉前线健儿
    【新华社平汉前线三日电】平汉前线八路军继续勇猛推进，已先后解放定兴、容城二县城。定兴县城于三日午后四时三十分获得解放，此为平汉自卫反击以后解放之第三座县城。据守该城之伪刘祖升部之辎重营、炮兵连、机枪连、通讯队、军部直属队等一千余人全部被歼，无一漏网，详细战果正清查中。该匪部原为日寇治安军，去秋为国民党十一战区收编，仍由伪治安军副军长康慕飞直接率领，盘踞定兴，曾多次出扰蚕食解放区，当地人民恨之入骨。定兴位于徐水与高碑店之间，交通畅达，为平汉北段城市之一。容城县城于二日十时为八路军恢复，盘踞该城之伪军八百余人及伪“还乡团”等全部被歼。该城位于平汉路东，为冀中解放区边陲重地，去秋八月间曾为八路军解放，后又被蒋伪侵占。
    【新华社平汉前线二日电】平汉前线八路军的自卫反击战仍在发展，继十二小时内控制保定南北二百五十里铁路、解放徐水望都等十余城镇车站后，北段又解放定兴车站，进围定兴县城。昨（一日）午后虽大雨滂沱，前线健儿仍按既定作战计划，继续扫清各点线之蒋伪残匪，并乘胜猛烈推进中。解放望都之役，八路军仅以三十余人之伤亡取得俘虏蒋伪军六百余人之战果，创造了新的战斗纪录。
    【新华社张家口一日电】（迟到）平汉前线八路军自卫反击大捷消息传抵此间后，中共晋察冀中央局、晋察冀军区及边区政府即分别致电嘉勉，边区政府并派民政处柯庆施处长携款二千万元前往劳军。晋察冀中央局电称：“你们为了自卫，为了报仇，为了保护八年流血苦战的成果，为了粉碎蒋介石的疯狂进攻，恢复国内和平，以无比的英雄气概和平汉线蒋伪军大举反击，这是革命人民与人民军队光荣本质的崇高表现，我们仅向你们致伟大的敬意！”晋察翼军区电称：“希望你们再接再厉，继续扩展战果，把胜利的锋芒直射国民党反动派的心脏！”晋察冀日报时评中，对平汉线军民在蒋军向察哈尔张家口开始进攻十九小时后迅速进行还击，并在十二小时内获得了控制二百五十里铁路线，解放徐水、望都等十数城镇军站之辉煌战果，备加赞扬，号召该区军民积极参战，彻底粉碎蒋军进攻！
