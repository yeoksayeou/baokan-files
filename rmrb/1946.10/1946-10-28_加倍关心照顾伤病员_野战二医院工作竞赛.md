　　Redoubled Care for the Wounded and Sick
    Work Competition at the Second Field Hospital
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In order to rapidly heal the wounded and sick, and to benefit the patriotic self-defense war, the Second Field Hospital launched a work competition. The movement started with five model nursing platoons: they created a new record of one person cooking sixty small pots of rice per day. The leadership used this as an example to call on all units to "redouble their care for the wounded and sick, so that the wounded and sick can recover as soon as possible and return to the front line." All units immediately launched a revolutionary competition. On October 8th, when several patients came down from the front line, Liang Yuyao, a sixteen-year-old junior nurse from the Fourth Unit, carried boiling water to meet the stretchers two miles away. He took care of the patients like a younger brother taking care of his sick elder brother, giving the patients infinite comfort. Another junior nurse gave his own quilt to a wounded soldier to cover himself. Nurses in the Second Unit guaranteed to weave straw mats for recuperating soldiers, and to emulate the Fifth Nursing Platoon. The communications squad made a suggestion to the hospital leadership: "If there are more color signals, we are willing to go to the wards to take care of patients." The cooking squad guaranteed to cook food according to the tastes of the wounded and sick, so that everyone would be satisfied. All the staff in the hospital unanimously declared: "We must care for the wounded and sick like Liang Yuyao, and we must use the spirit of the 'Warriors of Dayang Lake' to treat the wounded and sick!"

　　加倍关心照顾伤病员
    野战二医院工作竞赛
    【本报讯】为了迅速治愈伤病员，以利爱国自卫战争，第二野战医院展开工作大竞赛。运动从五所模范看护排开始：他们创造了一人一天作六十锅小锅饭的新记录。领导上以此为例，号召各所“加倍关心伤病员，使伤病员早日痊愈，重赴前线”，各所立即发动了革命的大竞赛。十月八日，前线下来几个病号，四所十六岁的小看护员梁玉尧，提着开水到二里以外去迎担架。他像一个小弟弟伺候害病的哥哥一样，使病者获得无限安慰。另一小看护员则把自己的被子送给伤员盖。二所看护保证给休养员包打草席，向五所看护排看齐。通讯班向院部提意见说：“要是彩号多了，我们愿自动去病房照顾病人”。炊事班保证依照伤病员口味做菜饭，要使人人都吃得满意。全院工作人员一致声称：“要像梁玉尧一样关心伤病员，要用“大杨湖勇士”的精神去救治伤病员”！
