　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Reuters Paris reported this morning: The result of the French new constitution referendum on the 13th shows that the new constitution has been approved by the French people with a majority of over 1.23 million votes. The results are as follows: 8,794,109 votes in favor, 7,554,779 votes against, and 7,490,074 abstentions. It is reported that the new parliamentary elections will be held on November 10th. This new constitution is the fourth constitution of the French Republic. Since France fell in 1940, the Vichy government of the German puppet Pétain abolished the 1875 constitution of the French Third Republic. Since the liberation of France, there has been no new constitution. The new constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly elected in the general election last October was rejected by the referendum vote on May 5th this year due to the opposition of the People's Republic. This is the referendum for the second new draft constitution. On the eve of the referendum, domestic and foreign reactionaries, led by De Gaulle, tried their best to instigate French voters to reject the new constitution, which is more democratic than the first republican constitution, so as to keep the French people in a state of temporary unrest, so as to fish in troubled waters and trap France into reaction. However, this attempt has failed. The large number of abstentions in this referendum is generally estimated to be related to the confusion caused by the differences of opinion within the Popular Republican Movement and the Socialist Party among their voters. Although these two parties expressed their support for the new constitution in the parliament, they were unwilling to break with the De Gaulle reactionaries in action, thus creating this situation. For example, in Strasbourg, where the Popular Republican Movement dominates, about 60,000 people voted, while 53,000 abstained.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Comprehensive Paris News; On the eve of the French new constitution referendum, all French political parties have been fully mobilized to launch a struggle for this. The Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, the Human Rights League, the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Youth Federation and other parties have launched a campaign to win the approval of the new constitution. However, except for the Communist Party, which has a unified pace, other political parties are in a state of division and confusion, whether in the leadership organs or in their lower-level members. Although the leader of the Popular Republican Movement, the current president and foreign minister, Bidault, made a broadcast on the evening of the 11th, urging the party members to invest in the new constitution, the party organization tried its best to explain that the new constitution was "temporary" in its support for the new constitution movement, and that the party would propose amendments in the future to increase the power of the president and the Senate. This situation has caused confusion among the voters who support the party. The Catholic Church, which has close ties with the party, also lacks a consistent attitude. The Bishop of Montauban called on all believers to vote against it, while the Bishop of Toulouse said that "all French people who are tired of temporary regimes should welcome its constitution." The attitude of the Socialist Party is also unstable. Although the party expressed its support for the constitution and opposed the De Gaulle plan, the right-wing veteran leader Blum actually supported De Gaulle's argument, advocating strong presidential power. The Liberal Republican Party (a center-left alliance), a large bourgeois party, with the financial support of many trusts and banks, is doing its utmost to oppose the new constitution with its large amount of campaign funds. Other organizations, such as the French Christian Labor Association, the General Agricultural Alliance, and the National Employers' Association, have no definite stance, and leave their members to vote at will.

### 法国新宪复决通过  右派阵容混乱阴谋否决失败

　　法国新宪复决通过
    右派阵容混乱阴谋否决失败
    【新华社延安十四日电】据路透社巴黎今晨电讯：十三日法国新宪法复决结果，新宪已以一百二十三万余票之多数，获得法国人民的通过。结果如下：赞成者八百七十九万四千一百零九票，反对者七百五十五万四千七百七十九票，放弃投票者则达七百四十九万零七十四票。据悉新国会大选举将于十一月十日举行。按此次新宪为法兰西共和国第四个宪法，自一九四○年法国沦陷，德寇傀儡贝当的维希政府废除一八七五年法兰西第三共和国宪法，以至法国解放以来，法国迄无新宪法，由去年十月大选产生的立宪议会所草拟之新宪，由于人民共和国之反对，遭今年五月五日之复决投票否决，此次则为第二个新宪草案的复决。复决前夕，法国内外反动派以戴高乐为首，曾竭力鼓动法国选民再次否决这个比第一共和国宪法较为民主的新宪，而使法人继续处于临时不安状态中，以便混水摸鱼，陷法国于反动，但此企图业已失败。此次复决投票中，弃权者如是之多，据一般估计可能与人民共和党与社会党内部意见分岐在其选民中所引起的混乱情绪有关。该二党在议会中虽表示拥护新宪，但在行动上却不愿与戴高乐反动派决裂，因此造成此种情况。比如在人民共和党占优势的斯特勒斯堡，投票者约六万人，而放弃投票者则达五万三千人。
    【新华社延安十三日电】综合巴黎讯；在法国新宪法复决投票前夕，法国各政党已全体动员为此而展开斗争。共产党、社会党、人民共和党、人权同盟、法国总工会、法国青年联合会等各个党派，都展开了争取批准新宪法的运动，但除共产党有一致的步伐外，其他政党无论在领导机关中或在其下级组员中，都处于分歧与混乱中。人民共和党领袖现任总统兼外长的比道尔，虽然在十一日晚发表广播，敦促该党党员投资赞成新宪法，但该党组织却在其支持新宪运动中极力说明新宪是“临时性的”，将来该党还要提出修改，以增加总统及参院的权力。这种情况已使支持该党的选民中发生纷乱。与该党关系密切的天主教教会方面，也缺乏一致的态度，蒙托邦主教号召一切信徒投反对票，而土鲁斯主教则说“一切厌倦临时政权生活的法国人，应该欢迎其宪法”。社会党的态度也是不稳定的，该党虽表示拥护期宪反对戴高乐方案，但右派老朽领袖勃鲁姆反实际上支持戴高乐的论调，主张强有力的总统权力。自由共和党（中左派联盟）这一个大资产阶级政党，则在许多托辣斯与银行的财政支持下，以其大量的运动基金极力进行反对新宪法。另一些组织如法国基督教劳苦及同盟、农业总同盟、全国雇主协会等，则无确定立场，而一任其自己的会员随意投票。
