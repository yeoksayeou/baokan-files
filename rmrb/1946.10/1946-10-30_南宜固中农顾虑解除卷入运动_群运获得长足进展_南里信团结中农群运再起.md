[Report from this newspaper in Yangcheng, 20th] In Nanyigu Village of this county, the interests of middle peasants were taken into consideration during the mass movement, defeating the landlords' rumors and divisive plots, and enabling the movement to achieve significant progress. During the mass struggle this spring against Su Congchuan, a lawless landlord and usurer, the middle peasants of the village were hesitant and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Even if they had their own grievances, they did not express them, believing that the liquidation of the landlords was only a matter for the tenant farmers. Su Zisheng, a middle peasant, although he had suffered all kinds of oppression from Su Congchuan, was unwilling to participate in the struggle. Later, inspired by the mass grievance campaign, he spoke of his suffering at the struggle meeting, but he firmly refused the four mu of land that were allocated to him as a result of the struggle. Su Bingwang, Su Congchuan's henchman, took the opportunity to spread rumors and intimidate the middle peasants, saying, "Eventually, all property owners will be struggled against. It's only a matter of time whether you are struggled against sooner or later." Su Zisheng was afraid and proposed to hand over his two and a half mu of self-cultivated land to the village public to be distributed to the masses. Following this, middle peasants Yan De, Su Xiaohe, and others also proposed to return the fruits of struggle they had previously received. Upon discovering this problem, the leadership immediately mobilized the masses to educate the middle peasants with the idea that "all peasants under heaven are one family, and joint efforts to turn over a new leaf create great strength," and paid special attention to taking care of their interests in the actual movement. Su Wangqi, a middle peasant, was a usurer. When the masses cleared up his issues, they only asked him to take out some things to compensate for the losses of the masses, and did not touch his land at all. Bi Baogen, a middle peasant, did not have a very good relationship with the masses. In the past struggle, three mu of his land had been liquidated. This was also returned to him. In the subsequent distribution of fruits, special consideration was given to the middle peasants who had benefited less in the past. From practical experience, the middle peasants of the village realized that "middle and poor peasants are one family" and firmly stood on the side of the poor peasants, struggling together. This enabled the rapid realization of "land to the tiller" in the village. The village has a total of 256 households. Before this liquidation movement, there were only 72 middle peasant households. Now, it has increased to 240 households.

[Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] Nanlixin Village in Xiangyuan County, after recently resolving the ideological concerns of middle peasants and achieving great unity between middle and poor peasants, has re-launched the liquidation movement. In the movement in the first half of the year, the village did not absorb the participation of the broad masses of middle peasants. Some middle peasants were also subjected to struggle. The peasant association was closed, and many middle peasants failed to join the peasant association, which aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of middle peasants, allowing landlords to take the opportunity to counterattack, and the liberation of peasants was not thorough. Upon discovering this problem, the leadership studied the situation with the village cadres and, after unifying their understanding, convened a village-wide peasants' meeting. At the meeting, it was proposed to "say whatever you want, pour out your innermost feelings," to inspire the middle peasants to speak. Wang Zhongtang, a middle peasant, said, "My brothers and I have been toiling peasants all our lives. We have to be frugal every year just to have enough to eat and wear. I applied twice, but was not allowed to join the peasant association. Later, I thought, if they don't want me, they're probably going to struggle against me. I originally planned to buy a cart this spring to produce well, but the thought of struggle made me lose interest." Sun Si said, "In the past, because I borrowed 40 yuan of high-interest loans from the landlord Wang Futang, I was forcibly taken away from over 20 mu of good land. During the famine, my whole family almost starved to death. I was planning to bring this matter up during the liquidation of old debts this spring, but I felt that I was a middle peasant and was afraid that the peasant association would not care about it, so I didn't mention it." After many middle peasants spoke, it was proposed at the meeting: middle and poor peasants are one family, and the peasant association should absorb them. The peasant association announced, "The peasant association is an organization of all peasants and will definitely absorb middle peasants to participate," and Wang Zhongtang, Sun Si, and several others joined the peasant association on the spot. Since then, the peasant camp in the village has become visibly stronger, and a liquidation struggle against the big landlord Wang Ziren was immediately launched. In the movement, many middle peasants became new activists.

　　南宜固中农顾虑解除卷入运动
    群运获得长足进展
    南里信团结中农群运再起
    【本报阳城二十日讯】本县南宜固村在群众运动中，照顾中农利益，击败了地主造谣挑拨阴谋，使运动获得长足进展。今春群众斗争不法地主兼高利贷剥削者苏从川时，该村中农犹豫不决，采取观望态度，自己有苦也不诉，认为清算地主只是佃户的事。中农苏资胜虽曾受过苏从川的百般压迫，亦不愿参加斗争。后来经过群众诉苦运动的启发，他在斗争大会上诉了苦；但分配果实时给他四亩地，他却坚决不要。苏从川的狗腿苏炳旺更乘机造谣恐吓中农说：“将来有产者一齐斗，先斗后斗不过是迟早而已”。苏资胜害怕，乃提出要将二亩半自耕地交给村公所分给群众。接着中农阎德、苏小和等也提出退出以往分得的斗争果实。领导上发现这一问题，立即发动群众对中农进行“天下农民是一家，合伙翻身力量大”的教育，并特别注意在实际运动中照顾他们的利益。中农苏旺起是个高利贷者，群众清理他的问题时，只让他拿出一些东西以赔补群众损失，完全未动他的土地。中农毕保根和群众关系不很好，在过去斗争中清算了他三亩地，这时也退回了，在以后分配果实时，特别照顾了过去得利较少的中农。该村中农从实际经验中体验到“中贫农是一家”，便坚定的站到贫农方面，一齐斗争。使该村耕者有其田得以迅速实现。该村共二百五十六户，这次清算运动前仅有七十二户中农，现在则已增至二百四十户。
    【本报长治讯】襄垣南里信村，于最近解决了中农思想顾虑，中、贫农大团结后，重新掀起了清算运动。该村前半年运动中，由于没有吸收广大中农参加，对一些中农又采取了斗争方式，农会关门，许多中农未能加入农会，引起广大中农不满，致地主乘机反攻，农民翻身未能彻底。领导上发觉这一问题，与村干部研究，统一认识后，即召开了全村农民大会，会上提出：“有甚说甚，倒各人的心头话”，启发中农发言。中农王中堂说：“我弟兄们一辈是受苦庄稼汉，年年省吃俭用，才闹的够吃够穿，我要求过两次，都没参加了农会。以后我就想，人家不要我，恐怕要斗争，原计划今年春天买一辆大车，好好生产，但一想到斗争，就冷下来”。孙寺说：“我过去因借了地主王富堂四十元高利贷，被人家霸占去好地二十多亩，灾荒中，全家几乎饿死。这事情，今春清理旧债时，我就打算提出，但觉得自己是中农，怕农会不管没提。”许多中农发言后，会上提出：中、贫农是一家人，农会应该吸收他们。农会宣布：“农会是全体农民的组织，一定吸收中农参加”，当场即有王中堂，孙寺等数人参加农会。此后，该村农民阵营立见强大，随即展开对大地主王子仁的清算斗争。运动中不少中农成为新的积极分子。
