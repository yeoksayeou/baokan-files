　　Huailai City, southeast of Zhangjiakou's outer perimeter, is still being firmly defended by the Eighth Route Army as of the time of this dispatch. Chiang's troops' 16th Army main force, after invading Kangzhuang, launched an attack on Huailai, concentrating over 30 artillery pieces and firing over 3,000 shells at the Eighth Route Army's positions along the Xinzhuang-Shuiquan line, five to ten miles east of Huailai City, this morning. They were also supported by seven aircraft, which carried out indiscriminate bombing and strafing. The defending troops heroically resisted. Fierce fighting has been ongoing for six hours since 8:00 AM and has not yet ceased. The Eighth Route Army is firmly defending its positions, and has not yielded an inch. The "World Evening News" in Beiping reported: "Government troops have occupied Huailai, a fortified outpost of Zhangjiakou, and are advancing towards Xiahuayuan" (United Press, Beiping, 2nd dispatch), which is pure fabrication.

　　蒋军猛犯怀来
    我方坚守不动
    【新华社平绥东线三日十四时急电】（迟到）张家口东南外围怀来城迄发电时止，仍在八路军坚守中。继侵康庄后向怀来进攻之蒋军十六军主力，于今晨以步炮坦克向怀来城东五里至十里辛庄、水泉一线八路军阵地进攻，集中大炮三十余门，发炮三千余发，并有七架飞机配合，滥肆轰炸扫射，守军英勇抵抗，激战从八时起已历六小时，迄未停止。八路军坚守阵地，分毫未动。北平“世界晚报”载：“政府军已占领张家口外围堡垒——怀来，并向下花园推进”（合众社北平二日电）云云，纯系捏造。
