Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Paris dispatch: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky (acting head of delegation) and advisor to Byrnes, Connally, delivered speeches on the 5th at the Political Committee of the Italian Peace Conference. Vyshinsky pointed out that no matter how different the opinions among countries, the world should still cooperate. Vyshinsky continued: "We deeply know that political opinions are different, and reactions to international events are also different, but the Soviet Union still adheres to Stalin's statement of peace." Connally said: "We should not and cannot have another war. Some have talked about the possibility of war, but I do not believe that mankind has lost its sanity, that countries have reached the point of forgetting humanity and wanting to see the people of the world stained with blood again."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Paris dispatch: The discussions of the committees of the Peace Conference on the clauses of the draft treaties basically ended on the 6th. Some committees are still drafting the final reports. The Economic Committee for Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, although pressed for time and meeting continuously, is still in constant dispute. The committee debated the Bulgarian reparations issue for more than 29 consecutive hours from the 4th to the 5th, which was the longest meeting of the Paris Peace Conference. The plenary session of the Peace Conference was held on the afternoon of the 6th, with Bevin as chairman. The atmosphere was very calm. The Foreign Ministers' meeting's recommendations on the rules of procedure for the plenary session were all passed at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: New York dispatch: Recently, the American-Soviet Friendship Association held a mass meeting in Madison Square Garden, New York, and passed a motion urging Truman to restore the policy of Big Three unity and abandon the United States' sole control of the atomic bomb. Wade, leader of the American Anti-Bigotry and Struggle Committee, said in a speech at the meeting: Those who provoke hatred and animosity towards the Soviet Union are birds of a feather with the criminals and war instigators judged in Nuremberg. Radio commentator Welles urged support for the peace policy proposed by Wallace. The meeting telegraphed Wallace, stating that they were happy to join the movement for peace based on the unity of the Big Three and American-Soviet cooperation.

    【新华社延安七日电】巴黎讯：苏副外长维辛斯基（代理团长）与贝纳斯顾问康纳利于五日在和会意政委会先后发表演说。维辛斯基指出各国间之见解无论如何歧异，世界仍当合作。维氏继称：“吾人深知政治见解各有不同，对于国际事件之反应亦各不相同，然苏联仍坚持斯大林之和平声明。”康纳利称：“吾人不应且不能再有一次战争。有人已谈及战争之可能性，但我不信人类已失去理智、国家已到达忘却人道而欲再见世界人民双手染血之阶段。”
    【新华社延安七日电】巴黎讯：和会各委员会关于各条约草案条款的讨论已于六日基本上结束，有些委员会尚在草拟最后报告中，罗保匈芬经济委员会虽迫于时间而连续集会，但仍争执不休，该委员会为辩论保加利亚赔款问题，曾于四日至五日连续会议达二十九小时以上，为巴黎和会中最长的一次集会。和会全会已于六日下午召开，贝文任主席，会场极为平静。外长会议关于全会议事程序规则的建议已在会上全部通过。
    【新华社延安七日电】纽约讯：日前美苏友谊协会曾在纽约麦迪逊广场花园召开群众大会，通过议案，力促杜鲁门恢复三强团结的政策，并放弃美国单独管制原子弹。美国反偏执斗争委员会领袖韦德在大会上演说称：那些挑拨对苏仇视和憎恨的人与在努连堡判决的罪犯和战争挑拨者是一邱之貉。无线电评论家威尔斯力促支持华莱士所提出的和平政策。大会致电华莱士，声明他们乐于加入以三强团结及美苏合作为基础的争取和平运动。
