    [This Dispatch from Yangcheng, 22nd] The renowned Baodian Town Medicinal Herb Fair and Mule and Horse Fair in Changzi, famous throughout North China, have reopened on the anniversary of Changzi's liberation. The Mule and Horse Fair began on the sixth day of the ninth lunar month and will last for half a month. Merchants from all directions are gathering, and a large number of livestock are being traded, making it a spectacle unseen in many years. The Medicinal Herb Fair will begin on the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month and will continue until the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, promising an even grander occasion. Historically, Baodian Town has held a Mule and Horse Fair on the thirteenth day of the ninth month, where mules, horses, and livestock from provinces such as Hebei, Tianjin, Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as well as local pigs, sheep, copper, ironware, and porcelain, all gathered for trade. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month, it transitioned into the Medicinal Herb Fair, where a large quantity of raw and processed medicinal materials, pills, powders, plasters, traditional Chinese and Western medicines, and various mountain products from Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hebei, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, and the local area were gathered for brisk sales, lasting for two months. It has long been one of the most famous fairs in North China. It was suspended for eight years after the enemy occupied Changzi.
