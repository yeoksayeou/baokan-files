Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to Chongqing newspapers, a unit of the armed uprising of people on the Sichuan-Guizhou border attacked the suburbs of Chongqing on the 29th of last month, seizing a large number of military supplies and resources, shocking all of Chongqing. This unit of the armed uprising, numbering over a hundred, carried three machine guns and dozens of rifles, and wore yellow uniforms. At 7:00 AM that day, they suddenly entered the vicinity of Yipinchang and Jiudaofang, just tens of miles from Chongqing, and ambushed the road on both sides. At about 9:00 AM, twelve military trucks and jeeps of the Southwest Highway Bureau heading to Guiyang, fully loaded with military supplies and resources of the Kuomintang Logistics Headquarters, passed through the area and entered the ambush circle. The unit immediately rose up, surrounded and attacked, forcing them to stop. All the escorting Chiang Kai-shek officers were disarmed, and one officer who attempted to resist was wounded and fled. In this battle, the unit seized two large truckloads of guns, ammunition, and other military supplies. By the time Chiang Kai-shek's troops heard the news and rushed to reinforce, the unit had already successfully transferred to the deep mountains of Qijiang. Afterwards, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Chongqing, Qijiang, Dongxi and other places were extremely shocked. The 102nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Qijiang hastily transported the guns and ammunition left in Qijiang to Chongqing in batches in recent days "to prevent any eventuality."
