　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 28th—Since August, the people's militia in Wangdu, Dingxian, Huolu and other counties in the third sub-district of the Hebei-Jinjiang area along the Pinghan Railway, either independently or in coordination with the main force, have repelled 1,334 incursions and disturbances by Chiang's troops. They killed or wounded 857 Chiang's and puppet troops (officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander), captured 50, destroyed three bridges, 204 rails, one train, and in coordination with the main force, counterattacked and captured many strongholds such as Dongquancheng (northwest of Zhengding), removed four bunkers, destroyed more than 1,100 zhang of railway, seized 30 rifles, 4 pistols, 39 landmines, 282 hand grenades, 505 bullets, more than 4,500 jin of electric wire, and a large number of other grains, carts, and livestock. In the successive self-defense operations, the people's militia, with simple weapons and a small force, annihilated and defeated Chiang's troops that were dozens of times larger than themselves. On September 18, when the "Dare-to-die Corps" of Chiang's troops from Wangzhuangzi, Dingxian, continuously besieged seven villages, including Luzhuangzi, Dongxi Ganfu, with more than 2,000 troops in two waves, the villagers' militia, relying on solid underground fortifications, supported each other in combat, repelling 12 charges by Chiang's troops in one go, killing or wounding 55 Chiang's soldiers and officers (including 4 squad leaders), and the rest fled in panic. The militia suffered two casualties.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 27th—Nearly 10,000 well-equipped militia from Zuoyun, Huairen, Shuoxian, Pinglu and other counties in Yanbei have gone to the front lines to cooperate with local military corps in carrying out guerrilla warfare to protect the autumn harvest. The Shuoxian militia and backbone team, known for their bravery and skill in battle, have arrived at the front under the leadership of Captain Li Buzhou. The militia combat teams in Daiyue and other places, in conjunction with the local militia self-defense teams near Datong, have extensively launched explosions. On the 21st, more than 700 Yan's troops from Xinxian City harassed the villages of Beihucun in the west. When Yan's troops stepped on the landmines pre-buried by the militia, they left more than 30 bodies and fled in panic. Su Lianke, a militiaman from Zhishao Village, buried seven mines alone, killing 17 Yan's soldiers. According to incomplete statistics, the militia in the villages around Xinxian have killed or wounded more than 100 Yan's puppet troops in recent weeks. On the 13th, a company of the 208th Regiment of Yan's troops in Fenyang, Jinzhong, harassed the villages of Canghe Yongqian at dawn. After four hours of combat by the militia combat team, the Yan's puppet troops retreated after suffering eight casualties. Qiu Genzi, the militia captain of Yuefeng Village in Pingyao and Jiexiu, and four others used five landmines seized from Yan's troops to kill more than 14 Yan's soldiers.
