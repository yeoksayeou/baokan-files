Three Liberated Brothers
    Yong Jin

    On the afternoon of September 6th, when the invading army's 20th Brigade, 59th Regiment of the 3rd Division, entrenched in Dayang Lake, broke out, Zheng Yujing was liberated by the 6th Company of our 4th Regiment.

    They hadn't closed their eyes or eaten for two days and two nights. When he came to the 6th Company, instructor Wang Changyi immediately picked up three or four white steamed buns for him and personally brought him a bowl of water. He took it gratefully and said, "In the past, I only knew that the Eighth Route Army didn't kill prisoners. I surrendered my gun, but I really didn't know the Eighth Route Army was so good." He patted his chest and said, "Instructor! People must act according to their conscience. In the future, I will definitely follow you!"

    Instructor Wang handed him a Mauser rifle that he had brought. Zheng Yujing was overjoyed and immediately oiled it.

    The remnants of the 3rd Division collapsed, and the pursuit began that afternoon. During the pursuit, he ran to the front. Others thought he had deserted, but after a while, he led back a prisoner plus a Mauser rifle. Although he had just arrived in the Eighth Route Army today, it was as if he had been here for half a year.

    The next day, the troops made contact with the enemy at Dulou. He still ran to the front as he did yesterday. He chased and shouted, "The Eighth Route Army gives preferential treatment to prisoners. Surrender your weapons! I also came from the 3rd Division." Two enemies running in front of him saw that he was wearing the same green uniform as them, so they stopped. Zheng Yujing happily led the two prisoners, carrying two Mauser rifles, to see the instructor. When Instructor Wang praised him, he said, "I still want to capture a machine gun!" Zheng Yujing is from Henan. He was forced to join the Kuomintang army during the years of great disaster. He said, "Being a soldier in the Central Army just doesn't feel right. Now that I've come to the Eighth Route Army as a fighter, where equality is emphasized and democracy is practiced, now I have to work harder."

    Xu Chaoshun was also a corporal in the 20th Brigade, 59th Regiment of the 3rd Division. After being liberated, he heard the instructor talk about the policy of preferential treatment for prisoners. He said, "As long as the officers treat me well, I will follow them!" He talked to the instructor about his history: he had three brothers, all of whom were captured by the Central Army. His elderly parents at home still don’t know if they are dead or alive..." As he spoke, he couldn't help but shed tears. Later, he mentioned that when he first arrived in the company, he told the company commander that he knew how to shoot a rifle and throw grenades. The company commander immediately handed him his original weapon.

    The next day, a battle broke out with the 40th Division at Wanglou. The company commander was wounded, and the team was commanded by the instructor. The instructor felt that Xu Chaoshun had just arrived, so it was not good to give a direct order, so he discussed with him, "Can you shoot in through that window?" He said, "Instructor, if I can't hit it with three shots, you can cut off my head." He fired eleven shots in a row, and every bullet went in through the window. The enemy suffered a dozen casualties. He said to several soldiers, "They are now my enemies, and we can't be polite. If we are polite to them, they won't be polite to us." After his eleven bullets, the enemy dared not be crazy again, and did not even approach the gunholes.

    Wu Deshan was liberated when fighting the 181st Division and is now working in the 6th Company. He already understands the rules of the Eighth Route Army. At the same time, there are many newly liberated comrades in the 6th Company. When we attacked the 3rd Division, because the battle was tense, the troops marched to Dulou and had not eaten for a day. Everyone was hungry. Several newly liberated comrades picked dates to eat. Wu Deshan, leading his horse, said loudly, "Comrades: We are already members of the Eighth Route Army. Don't violate the discipline of the masses!" The new soldiers who picked dates felt embarrassed after being reminded by him, and lowered their heads in shame.

    These brothers liberated by the Eighth Route Army have been transformed into people's fighters after being baptized by justice. They are not only brave in combat, but also observe mass discipline very well.

　　三个被解放的弟兄
    勇进
    九月六日下午，盘踞在大杨湖的进犯军整三师二十旅五十九团往外突围的时候，郑玉经就被我四团六连解放了。
    他们已经两天两夜没有合眼也没有吃饭，他来到六连后，指导员王长义同志马上拾了三四个白馒头给他、并亲自给他端了一碗水、他感动的接过手来说：“过去我只知道八路军不杀俘虏，我就缴了枪，我真不知道八路军这样好。”他拍着胸口说：“指导员！人总要凭良心呀，今后我一定要跟着你干！”
    王指导员把他带来的一支大盖枪交给了他，郑玉经高兴极了，立刻上了些油。
    整三师的残余溃退了，当日下午就开始了追击，在追击中，他跑到最前头去了，别人以为他开小差了，但一会他领了一个俘虏外加一支大盖枪回来了，虽然他今天刚到八路军里来就像来了半年的一样。
    第二天部队与敌人在杜楼接触了，他依然像昨天那样的跑到最前面去，他一面追一面喊“八路军优特俘虏，缴枪吧，我也是从整三师过来的。”在前面跑的两个敌人看他穿的是跟自己一样的绿衣服，就站住了，郑玉经高兴地领着这两个俘虏扛了两支大盖枪去见指导员，王指导员称赞他时，他说：“我还要缴机关枪哩！”郑玉经是河南人，在大灾年被迫参加了国民党的军队，他说：“在中央军里当兵怎么觉着不是味，现在来到八路军里当战士，讲平等，请民主，这一下我得加劲干了。”

    许朝顺也是整三师二十旅五九团的一个上等兵，被解放过来后，听了指导员讲优待俘虏政策，他说：“只要官长待俺好，俺就跟着他干！”他与指导员谈起他的历史：他弟兄三个，都被中央军抓走了，家里老父老母现在还不知道是死是活……”说着，他禁不住滴下眼泪。后来又提起刚到连里的时候，他就向连长说他会打枪手榴弹，连长当时便把原来的武器交给了他。
    第二天，在王楼与四十师开了火，连长负伤了，队伍由指导员指挥，指导员觉得许朝顺刚来，不好硬下命令，便和他商量说：“你是否能从那个窗户里打进去？”他说：“指导员，我三枪打不准，叫你将我的脑袋割掉。”他连打了十一枪，颗颗子弹都是从窗户里打进去的，敌人伤亡了十来个，他对几个战士说：“他们现在已成了我的敌人了，不能讲客气，我们对他们客气，他们却不会对我们客气。”他这十一发子弹过后，敌人再也不敢疯狂了，连枪眼也不挨近。

    吴德山是打一八一师时被解放的，现在已到六连工作，他已懂得了八路军的规矩。同时六连还有很多新解放的同志，当我们进击整三师时，因为战斗紧张，部队行至杜楼，已经一天没有吃饭了，大家都是又饥又饿，好几个新解放的同志都摘了枣吃，吴德山牵着马大声说：“同志：我们已经是八路军了，别违犯群众纪律呀！”那些摘枣吃的新战士被他这么一提醒，都觉得不好意思起来，羞得把头也低下了。
    这些被八路军解放的弟兄经过正义的洗礼，已经变成人民的战士了，他们不但作战勇敢，也同样很好的遵守群众纪律。
