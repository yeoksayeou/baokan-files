　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 12th: According to various reports, the ten-day-old maritime strike remains unresolved despite numerous efforts. The Maritime Technical Workers Union refuses piecemeal solutions and insists that the Shipping Committee must agree to apply any East Coast agreement to government ships sailing on the Pacific West Coast. Consequently, negotiations have reached another stalemate, and ships remain completely停驶(Tíng shǐ. Not moving-unable to find a better equivalent). Only the ship captains, chief mates, and pilots belonging to the American Federation of Labor have agreed to this partial resumption of shipping. Meanwhile, traffic clerks of the Southern Pacific Railroad voted by 99 percent on the 10th in favor of a strike in seven western states to urge the resolution of over seven hundred grievances. This strike will reduce transcontinental rail transport, and if final mediation fails, a strike will be held. At the same time, five hundred workers at the Chrysler Motor Company went on strike on the 8th to protest the dismissal of a foreman, causing the company's production to stagnate, reducing car output from 3,600 to 2,775 vehicles per day. Ford Motor Company, in turn, announced a five-day shutdown due to a shortage of steel sheets.

　　美国工潮方兴未艾
    【新华社延安十二日电】据各方报导：历时十日之海运罢工，虽经多方努力仍未解决，因航海技术工会拒绝零碎解决，而坚持航运委员会须同意将东岸之任何协议通用于太平洋西岸航行之政府船只，故谈判又陷僵局，船舶仍完全停驶。仅美国劳工联合会所属之船长大班及领航则已同意此种部分恢复航运办法。同时，南太平洋铁路之事务员，十日以百分之九十九表决赞成在西部七个州举行罢工，力促七百余件控诉案之解决，此项罢工将减少横贯大陆之铁路运输，如最后调解失败，则将举行罢工。同时，克利斯勒汽车公司五百名工人，因抗议开除工头一人而于八日罢工，使该公司生产停滞，致汽车由每日出产三六○○辆减至二七七五辆。而福特汽车公司则又以钢皮缺乏，宣布停工五日。
