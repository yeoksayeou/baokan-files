　　International Briefs
　　Shanghai (Associated Press): Archbishop Viktor, a Soviet citizen and head of the Russian Orthodox Church, was arrested by Kuomintang police on the 19th. The police stated that they were acting on instructions from the National Defense Ministry in Nanjing, but refused to explain the reason for the arrest. This incident has caused agitation among the 25,000 Soviet expatriates in Shanghai.
　　London: During the second session of the House of Commons debate on foreign policy on the 23rd, Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech. Attlee stated: "If we are to seek world peace, then countries of opposing natures must be prepared to tolerate each other and cooperate together." Attlee mentioned the differences between Britain and the Soviet Union, but he continued, "We believe that it is not only possible but also extremely necessary to work together in order to prevent the catastrophe of another war."
　　United Press: As various prices rise sharply, the United States is facing new economic difficulties. Another wave of strikes, similar to those in the summer of this year, may be imminent. The United Automobile Workers Union Executive Committee has announced that it will demand substantial wage increases from employers, reportedly an increase of 20 cents per hour.
　　Chicago Aviation News: Former US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau delivered a speech at a conference in Chicago on September 28, expressing dissatisfaction with the war-mongering of reactionary elements in the United States. He stated: The State Department must ensure that the atomic bomb is no longer used; in other words, that the arsenals of all countries never manufacture this weapon again. Once the atomic bomb is banned, he believes the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union can be eliminated in an instant.
