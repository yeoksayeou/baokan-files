　　Developing Agricultural and Sideline Production to Strengthen Rural Positions
    Xia Village Achieves "Cultivate One, Surplus One"
    Sheep Well Bottom Achieves Self-Sufficiency in Food and Clothing Through Huge Profits from Sideline Production

    [Report from Li Cheng by this newspaper] Under the leadership of labor hero Wang Fengqi, Xia Village in this county has far exceeded its original plan of "Cultivate Three, Surplus One" in production this year. Out of the village's 209 households, 35 households only achieved "Cultivate Three, Surplus One," while 6 households achieved "Cultivate Two, Surplus One," 92 households achieved "Cultivate One, Surplus One," 39 households achieved "Cultivate Three, Surplus Two," and 37 households achieved "Cultivate One, Surplus Two." The village has reached an average of "Cultivate One, Surplus One," achieving abundance and surplus for every family. To welcome the Labor Hero Conference, the village summarized its production achievements after the autumn harvest. This year, 914 mu of millet were planted, yielding 1,097 shi of millet; 630 mu of Golden Queen corn were planted, yielding 1,058 shi of corn (converted to millet); 452 mu of cotton were planted, yielding 2,254 shi of cotton (converted to millet); 1,439 mu of wheat were planted, yielding 1,295 shi; and other miscellaneous grains and vegetables were equivalent to 705 shi of millet. In terms of sideline production, 151 female spinners spun 960 jin of cotton, wove 9,164 chi of cloth, and earned over 690,000 yuan. Transportation, saltpeter production, large and small cooperatives, and household sideline industries earned a total of over 2.92 million yuan. Sideline production is expected to earn at least 7.02 million yuan this winter. The total income from sideline production is equivalent to 3,122 shi of millet. The total agricultural and sideline production is equivalent to 9,532 shi of fine grains. Based on the living standards of various classes, calculated at 3.2 to 3.6 dou per month for adults (small mouths are half), the village's 26 landlord and rich peasant households, 174 middle peasant households, and 9 poor peasant households need a total of 2,288 shi of rice, wheat, and corn (converted to fine grains) per year. Assuming each person needs 2 zhang of cloth and 1 jin of cotton per year for clothing, this is equivalent to 842 shi of fine grains. Other expenses, such as oil, salt, animal feed, and miscellaneous expenses, are equivalent to 1,599 shi of millet. The total annual consumption for the village is 4,730 shi. The harvest, after deducting consumption, leaves a surplus of 4,801 shi, more than enough to achieve "Cultivate One, Surplus One." The villagers concluded that the main reason for their success was following Chairman Mao's path of organization. Except for three households, all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village participated in mutual aid. Woman Wang Lanxia said, "Before, my man smoked opium and played cards every day. Now that he has joined the mutual aid group, he has changed for the better! This year, he harvested nine shi of grain without any hired labor, which is more than enough to feed and clothe our family of three." Secondly, the combination of agriculture and sideline production was important. In addition to achieving self-sufficiency in clothing for the entire village, women's spinning and weaving earned 870,000 yuan, which, together with the income from small-scale cooperative handicrafts and transportation, accounted for half of the village's agricultural income. Thirdly, the cultivation of specialty products, such as cotton and Golden Queen corn, was beneficial. Planting one mu of cotton is equivalent to planting more than four mu of millet, and one mu of Golden Queen corn produces one shi more than local corn, with four ears filling a large sheng. In addition, this year the village universally implemented more weeding and fertilization, and cotton was universally topped and pruned.

    [Report from Changzhi on the 24th by this newspaper] Sheep Well Bottom Village in Pingshun, with its thin soil and rocks, has become a prosperous new socialist village with sufficient food and clothing under the leadership of cooperative hero Yang Wangqiao. All 195 households in the village participated in agricultural mutual aid groups and actively organized sideline production, establishing four small-scale cooperatives, two flour mills, two textile factories, two wool weaving factories, and three specialized transportation teams. Within one year, sideline production generated a profit of over 3.037 million yuan, equivalent to the annual agricultural income. Yang Wangqiao's family of six earned 63,290 yuan from sideline production this year, equivalent to 63 shi and 2.9 dou of grain, plus 30 shi from agricultural income, achieving "Cultivate One, Surplus One." This year, the village also purchased 413 sheep, 20 head of livestock, 22 grain bins, 180 jars, one cart. Everything destroyed by the enemy and puppet regime during the War of Resistance is gradually being restored. There are now no poor people or idlers in the village. Several disabled people, such as Liu Ruxin, were also helped by small-scale cooperative loans to buy bamboo strips for basket weaving or knit sweaters, enabling them to support themselves. One hundred and eighty-eight women regularly spin cotton, weave cloth, spin wool, weave carpets, and weave towels. In addition to farming, 64 men with 25 carts and 23 animals regularly engage in transportation and trading. The profits from mills, flour mills, oil presses, pig raising, and chicken raising are also substantial. The village's winter production plan has already been drafted, with a target of earning 1.8 million yuan. (Jin Zujun)

    【本报黎城讯】本县霞庄在劳动英雄王逢奇领导下，今年生产成绩已远超过原订耕三余一计划。全村二百零九户中，除卅五户只达到耕三余一外，其余达到耕二余一者六户，耕一余一者九十二户，耕三余二者三十九户，耕一余二者三十七户。全村平均已达到耕一余一，做到了丰衣足食，家家有余。为迎接劳英大会，秋收后全村总结生产成绩，今年种谷九百十四亩，收谷折米一千零九十七石；金皇后玉茭六百三十亩，收玉茭折米一千零五十八石；棉花四百五十二亩，收花折米二千二百五十四石；麦一千四百三十九亩，收一千二百九十五石，其他杂粮蔬菜等折小米七百零五石。副业方面，一百五十一个纺妇纺花九百六十斤，织布九千一百六十四尺，赚洋六十九万余元；运输、制硝及大小合作社、家庭副业共赚洋二百九十二万余元，今冬副业最低可赚七百零二万余元。合计副业收入，共可折米三千一百廿二石。农副业合计共折细粮九千五百卅二石。根据各阶层生活水平，以大口每月三斗二升至三斗六升计算（小口二折一），全村廿六户地主富农，一百七十四户中农及九户贫农，全年须吃米、麦、玉茭折细粮二千二百八十八石。以每人每年穿二丈布，用一斤花计，穿用折细粮八百四十二石。其他负担、油、盐、牲口料及零星花消折米一千五百九十九石。合计全村全年须消耗四千七百三十石。收获除去消耗尚余四千八百零一石，足达耕一余一而有余。该村群众总结获得成绩的主要原因，是走了毛主席组织起来的道路。全村除三户外，所有全半劳力全体参加了互助，妇女王兰霞说：“从前俺家那个人天天吸大烟、打牌，如今参加了互助组可转变好啦！今年没掏一个工钱就打了九石粮食，一家三口人吃穿都用不了。”其次为农副业的结合，妇女纺织除达到全村穿衣自给外，还赚洋八十七万元，连小型合作社的手工业、运输所赚，占全村农业收入的一半。再次是种特产多，如棉花、金皇后等，种一亩棉花顶种四亩多谷子，金皇后一亩比土玉茭多产一石，四个穗就剥一大升。另外，在精耕细作上，今年该村普遍多锄多上粪，棉花普遍的打了杈去了顶。
    【本报长治廿四日电】石厚土薄的平顺羊井底村，在合作英雄杨王俏领导下，已成为丰衣足食的富庶新农村。全村一百九十五户都参加了农业互助组，又积极组织副业生产，成立了四个小型合作社，开粉房、纺织工厂、毛织厂各二，三个专门运输小组，一年内副业生产获利三百零三万七千余元，相当于全年的农业收入。杨王俏家六口人，今年副业生产收入达六万三千二百九十元，折谷六十三石二斗九升，以上农业收入三十石，已达耕一余一。今年该村还买进羊四百十三只，牲口廿头，席囤二十二张，缸一百八十个，车一辆，抗战中被敌伪破坏了的一切，正逐渐恢复。全村现已没有穷人和闲人，刘如新等几个残废人，亦由小型合作社贷款帮助他们买条编篮或打毛衣，生活已能自给。一百八十八个妇女经常纺花、织布、纺毛、织毯、织毛巾等。男人除种地外，有六十四个人，二十五辆大车，二十三个牲口经常作运输买卖。磨坊、粉坊、油坊、喂猪、喂鸡等盈利也很多。现该村冬季生产计划已拟出，计划赚洋一百八十万元。（晋子俊）
