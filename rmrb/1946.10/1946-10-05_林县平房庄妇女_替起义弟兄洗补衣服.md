　　Lin County Pingfang Village Women
    Wash and Mend Clothes for Uprising Brothers
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 3rd] The masses of Pingfang Village in Lin County heard that a part of the 177th Brigade (originally a division reorganized) that had revolted in Hui County was passing through their village. Men, women, old and young throughout the village busied themselves tidying up houses and preparing firewood and water. After the uprising brothers arrived in the village, the women immediately launched a washing and mending campaign, washing and mending more than a hundred pieces of clothing for them. The uprising soldiers said with emotion, "The liberated areas are so good. When will our home become a liberated area?"
    [Another Dispatch] A part of the 177th Brigade stationed in Pingfang Village, Lin County has begun studying. Currently, the subject of study is the CPC Central Committee's "July 7th Declaration."
