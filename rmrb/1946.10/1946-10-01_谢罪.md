　　Apology
    Han Feng
    Comrade Wen Kezhong was a soldier who had recently been liberated from Yan Xishan's army. Since joining the Eighth Route Army, he has made great progress through continuous education. However, during the self-defense battle in Hongtong Zhaocheng, in the tense situation of the battle, he relapsed into the old habits he had in the Kuomintang army and struck a civilian. "No hitting people, no cursing people" is the fine tradition of the Eighth Route Army, and this tradition must not be undermined. After being persuaded and educated, Comrade Wen Kezhong went to Mr. Li, whom he had struck, to "apologize."
    Wen Kezhong and Chen Dushan, carrying pork, followed their instructor into Mr. Li's home in Dongjia Village.
    "Comrade, comrade, please sit, sit down and have some water." Mr. Li greeted them as he would any other comrades. The instructor read aloud the personal letter from the leader expressing condolences to Mr. Li without sitting down. Mr. Li was stunned for a moment, and after a long while, with uneasy expressions in his eyes, he repeatedly said, "We are on the same side, we are on the same side, don't stand on ceremony."
    "Old fellow, you don't recognize me, do you?" Wen Kezhong said slowly, his face flushed, "I am... I am very sorry, I am... I am the one who hit you that night because you were slow to open the door..." Wen Kezhong was so moved that he burst into tears. Recalling the leader's words and the help from many veteran comrades, he realized that hitting people was wrong, and he was filled with remorse. He pointed to Mr. Li's waist, where he had hit him with his fist, and asked, "How is it? Alas... I..."
    "It's nothing, it's nothing, it's fine now." Mr. Li's anger had long since dissipated, and he hurriedly replied.
    "After I hit you, the leader found out and criticized me for being wrong. The veteran comrades also explained to me the reason why I shouldn't hit people. Later, I couldn't even sleep, and the more I thought about it, the more upset I became. I also have parents at home, and I hit you... I blame myself for learning bad habits in Yan Xishan's army before, and I haven't been in our Eighth Route Army for long, so I haven't received enough education... So... I must correct myself in the future. Please, Mr. Li, you must forgive me this time..." As he spoke, Comrade Wen Kezhong, who came from a peasant background, made a bow and was about to kneel down, but Mr. Li quickly stopped him and returned the bow, saying:
    "It's not your fault, comrade, it's my fault for not knowing it was our troops, and opening the door slowly." Mr. Li did not want Comrade Wen Kezhong to feel bad, but he and his wife were moved to tears by this scene. The village head who brought the comrades in was also deeply moved, and he persuaded, "Forget it, forget it, we are all on the same side, don't be sad!" But his eyes were also red, and he said, "I'll go buy watermelons for our comrades to eat." This reminded Mr. Li, and he wanted to rush to cook, but the comrades politely declined, and he felt very bad.
    When leaving, Mr. Li held Comrade Wen Kezhong's hand tightly and escorted him all the way to the outside of the village, patting him kindly on the shoulder and saying, "Comrade, go back and tell your commander, just say it was me who said it, don't make things difficult for him."

　　谢罪
    寒风
    温克忠同志是不久以前刚从阎锡山队伍里解放过来的战士，自从参加八路军以后，经过不断的教育，有了很大的进步。但在洪洞赵城自卫战斗中，在紧张战斗的情况下，他又犯了在国民党军队里的老毛病，动手打了老百姓。“不打人，不骂人”是八路军的优良传统，这一传统是不容破坏的，温克忠同志经说服教育后，去向被打的李先生“谢罪”。
    温克忠、陈杜山二人提着猪肉，跟着自己的指导员走进了董家村的李先生家里。
    “同志，同志，坐吧，坐下喝水。”李先生象看待一般同志一样的招呼着。指导员没坐下来就把首长慰问李先生的亲笔信念了一遍，李先生一时怔得发呆了，过了半晌才两眼露着杌隍不安的神情连声说：“自己人，自己人，还说两家话。”
    “老乡，你不认识我了吧？”温克忠脸涨得绯红慢吞吞的说：“我就是……………很对不起你，我就………就是那夜你开门开慢了打你的那个人…………”温克忠激动得落下泪来。想起首长的话和许多老同志的帮助，自己认识了打人的不对，愧悔交集。他指着自己用拳头打过的李先生的腰部问道：“怎么样了？唉………………我………”
    “没有甚，没有甚，现在好了。”李先生一股怒气早已消失了，忙着回答。
    “我打了你回去后，首长知道了，批评我不对，老同志们也给我解释了不该打人的道理，后来觉也睡不着，越想心里越难过，我家也有父母，打了你…………怨我从前在阎锡山军队里学坏了，来咱们八路军里也不久，受教育还少，所以…………今后一定要改正。请李先生一定要原谅我这次…………”说着，农民出身的温克忠同志打了一拱就要跪下去，李先生急忙拉住了不让跪，而且还了个拱说：
    “这不怨你，同志，怨我不知道是咱们的队伍，门开慢了。”李先生不让温克忠同志难过，可是自己和家里老婆却被这种情景感动得流下泪来。带同志们进来的闾长也深深的被感动了，他劝说：“算啦，算啦，都是自己人，不要难过啦！”可是他的眼也红了说：“我给咱们同志们去买西瓜吃。”这句话提醒了李先生，他要抢着做饭，同志们婉词谢绝，他感觉很难过。
    临走时，李先生紧紧地拉着温克忠同志的手一直送到村子外面，亲切的拍着他的肩膀说：“同志，回去给你长官说，就说是我说的，不要叫他们难为着你。”
