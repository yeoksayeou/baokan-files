　　Demanding Justice for Wrongs from Those Who Colluded with the Enemy and Harmed the People
    Daming Settles Accounts for the Crimes of the Catholic Church
    Two Thousand People, Including Both Religious and Non-Religious, Participate in the Struggle, Recovering Forty Million in Compensation
    [Our newspaper’s dispatch from Weixian, 26th] On the 29th of last month, over two thousand people, including residents and Catholics from Daming city and Nanliuzhuang, gathered to denounce Bishop Zha Zhongxia, a Hungarian national, and Father Jin of the Catholic Church. They had established the church in Daming for nearly fifty years. Before the War of Resistance, they colluded with local feudal forces, illegally seizing 150 mu of good farmland from the farmers of Nanliuzhuang, and placing the burden of silver and grain on the farmers' shoulders. During the Japanese occupation, they further colluded with the Japanese invaders, transferring all the corvée labor, carts, and funds to the farmers, causing countless farmers to go bankrupt. Most heinously, in the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937], they relied on the power of the Japanese invaders to breach the Liuzhuang levee, flooding over 40 hectares of fertile land in Nanliuzhuang for two years, causing thirty innocent people to starve to death. They arbitrarily detained and insulted the masses, and when the Japanese invaders surrendered, they concealed large quantities of supplies for them. After liberation, they continued their illegal activities, concealing large amounts of land, harboring Chiang Kai-shek's agents, spreading rumors, and colluding with local tyrants and landlords to oppose the masses. At the denunciation meeting, the masses shouted: "We want to vent the grievances of forty-six years!" "Down with the foreign bullies and running dogs!" Cao Zhang pointed at Bishop Zha and said, "You and the Japanese devils breached the levee, flooded us for two years, forced me to sell my eldest daughter, and starved my third daughter to death! What are you going to do about it today?" An old man, Kang Yuzhu, said, "In the 36th year of the Guangxu Emperor [1910], my father bought a mule, and they insisted it was stolen from them, sending my father to prison and forcing my family to compensate them with 56 mu of land, causing three of my seven family members to die of illness and three to starve to death. I thought I would carry this resentment to my grave, but who knew the heavens would open their eyes!" Cao Shanshu from Manzhou Street said, "Before the War of Resistance, you seized a large pit in our street and occupied my house. The lawsuit went to Baoding, but you bribed the officials, and we in Manzhou Street lost. We became poor because of your Catholic Church." A farmer in his forties questioned Bishop Zha, "Are you really doing good deeds? During the famine year, I picked a handful of elm leaves to eat, and you shot at me. If I hadn't run fast, I would have been killed by you!" The victims made accusations one after another, presenting more than fifty pieces of documented evidence of the criminal acts of the illegal bishop and priests of the Catholic Church. Bishop Zha and Father Jin were speechless and had to lower their heads and admit their mistakes to the masses, saying, "We have indeed done many unconscionable things. Today, we can only ask for everyone's forgiveness!" As a result of the reckoning, the bishop and priests of the Catholic Church had to compensate the masses for their losses of 40 million yuan. The masses discussed, "In the past, let alone reason with these foreign bullies, even entering their door was a crime. Now the people have stood up, and no one can bully us anymore!"

    【本报威县二十六日电】上月二十九日，大名城关、南刘庄两千余群众及天主教徒集会斗争天主教堂匈籍查中夏主教及金神甫。他们在大名立教堂近五十年，抗战前曾与当地封建势力结合，非法侵占南刘庄农民好地百五十亩，且将银粮压在农民肩上。日寇统治期间，更与日寇勾结，将出夫、出车、出款等全部转嫁与农民，使无数农民因此破产。最可恶的是民国廿六年依仗日寇势力掘开刘庄大堤，淹没南刘庄四十余顷良田历二年之久；饿死无辜群众卅人。他们任意扣押、侮辱群众，日寇投降时，并为其掩藏大批物资。解放后，仍继续不法活动，除隐瞒大批土地外，并多次掩藏蒋特，造谣破坏，结合恶霸地主，与群众为敌。斗争会上，群众高呼着：“要出尽四十六年的冤枉气！”“打倒洋恶霸和洋奴走狗！”曹张氏指着查主教说：“你们和鬼子扒开大堤，淹了俺二年，逼得俺卖了大妮，饿死三妮！今天你说怎办吧？”老头康玉珠说：“光绪三十六年，俺爹买了个骡子，他们硬说是偷他们的，把俺爹送到监狱里，强迫把俺家五十六亩地赔了他们，害得俺七口人气死三口，饿死三口。我只说这口气死了带进棺材去，谁知老天还会睁开眼睛哩！”满州街曹善书说：“抗战前你们霸了俺街大坑，又占了俺的房子，官司打到保定，你们拿钱买通官府，俺满州街打输了，俺们穷都穷到你天主堂身上。”一个四十多岁的农民向查主教质问：“你们真是行善吗？灾荒那年我摘把榆叶吃，你们就开枪打，不是我跑得快，早就给你们打死了！”被害群众纷纷控诉，当场提出天主堂不法主教及神甫等有证有据的罪恶事实五十多件。查主教及金神甫理屈词穷，不得不低头认错向群众说：“我们确实做了很多伤天害理的事，今天只有请求大家宽大！”清算结果，该天主堂主教及神甫等应赔偿群众损失四千万元。群众纷纷议论：“以前别说给这些洋恶霸说理，就是进他们的门也得犯罪。如今老百姓翻了身，谁也不能欺侮咱了！”
