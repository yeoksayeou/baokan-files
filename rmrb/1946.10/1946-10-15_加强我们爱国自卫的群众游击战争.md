　　Strengthen Our Patriotic Self-Defense Mass Guerrilla Warfare

　　The Kuomintang reactionaries have dispatched thirty-eight brigades to launch a full-scale offensive against our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area for nearly three months. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place on the land of twenty to thirty counties in our entire area. The battle situation will continue to expand and become more brutal. The characteristics of the war are its long-term nature and its brutality. Our entire military and civilian population must abandon any illusions of peace with the US-Chiang reactionaries, unite, and thoroughly crush the offensive of Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries, and fight to defend the Liberated Areas and for China's independence, democracy, and freedom. Our war is a just people's patriotic self-defense war. Our victory fundamentally relies on the people. In military terms, we rely on two forces: primarily the main force, concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one, and also relying on the widespread development of mass guerrilla warfare to coordinate with the main force in combat and independently maintain the struggle in certain areas. The more our guerrilla warfare can hold back the reactionaries' forces, dispersing them and confining them to points and lines, preventing them from maneuvering, the more it can strike at their supply lines, annihilate their small units (from a squad to a battalion or a regiment), and the more it can strike at reactionary landlord armed forces and protect the interests of the masses, the easier it will be for our main force to concentrate and annihilate the enemy. We will be able to support a long-term struggle in vast areas and quickly strive for victory.

　　In the past three months, our main force has achieved great results, winning six battles in six, annihilating more than ten brigades of the reactionaries. Our guerrilla warfare has also achieved results. In the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in southern Shanxi, there was the model action of the Maojindu militia. In northern Henan, there was Du Balian of Jiyuan. In eastern Henan, guerrilla units persisted in a long and arduous struggle and recently recaptured Taikang City. The guerrilla warfare in the Taihang-Qitai area is threatening the outskirts of Taiyuan. Particularly important is that the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the vast area north of the Longhai Railway is now in full swing. Countless soldiers and civilians are fighting bravely with the reactionaries, forcing the reactionaries to use more than ten brigades to defend these points and lines. In addition, guerrilla warfare is being fully prepared and deployed in areas that the reactionaries may invade. A huge hammer is being prepared to give the invaders a fierce blow. These situations have caused serious fear and wavering among senior Kuomintang generals. A senior general of the Chiang army said that the advancing areas have all been "reddened," and "bandits and civilians" are indistinguishable. Every village has been organized, and every village must be fought to be occupied. No ordinary people can be seen anywhere. This is the terrible giant shadow of the Liberated Area's guerrilla warfare reflected in the minds of the invaders in the civil war.

　　However, it must be admitted that because we were overly enthusiastic about peace, our preparations were insufficient when the reactionaries resolutely launched a full-scale civil war to eliminate the Liberated Areas. In some places, the organization of guerrilla warfare was even slackened, which prevented our guerrilla warfare from quickly reaching and exceeding the level of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare and adapting to the current needs. We have quickly discovered this shortcoming and are making effective improvements. In order to further strengthen mass guerrilla warfare, we would like to raise a few more issues for study.

　　It is necessary to correctly resolve the issue of understanding guerrilla warfare. According to the experience of several areas in developing mass guerrilla warfare, it is necessary to resolve several ideological problems of the cadres: First, cadres must understand the long-term and brutal nature of the war. Harboring wishful thinking about peace and having illusions about Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism will lead to serious crimes. Now, only struggle and only repelling the US-Chiang reactionaries can achieve true peace. Second, do not simply wait for the main force. The main force's task is to concentrate its forces to annihilate the enemy's living forces, not to be concerned about the gains and losses of a city or town, not to take care of everything. Therefore, in places where there is no main force and places that are temporarily or will be occupied by the Chiang army, it is necessary to rely on guerrilla warfare to persist in a long-term struggle and create favorable conditions for the main force to annihilate the enemy. Third, although the current situation is different from that of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang's plunder and slaughter are even worse than the Japanese. Its internal contradictions are unprecedentedly serious, while we have many favorable conditions to fully develop guerrilla warfare. The hundreds of thousands of armed peasants in Sichuan and Jiangnan who are fighting guerrilla warfare are a good example. Fourth, be prepared to strike at the reactionaries' offensive at any time, not waiting until the reactionaries come before preparing, but preparing for a rainy day. Fifth, accumulating small victories into major victories is the main combat task of the military region's local forces. In combat, it is necessary to fight battles that are sure to win, battles of annihilation. Even if only a squad, a platoon, a company, or a battalion is annihilated, it is a battle of annihilation and must be rewarded and promoted. It is wrong to rely solely on the core regiments to dance naked without developing mass guerrilla warfare. Facts have proven that the clearer these basic concepts are understood, the more tenacious guerrilla warfare will be developed.

　　We should carry forward the glorious tradition of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we had great and amazing creations in mass guerrilla warfare. This is our glorious tradition. Today, the main issue is how to inherit and carry forward those excellent traditions based on specific circumstances. For example, unified struggle, joint defense struggle, clearing the fields, border guard zone work, landmine warfare, trench warfare, sparrow warfare, flying demolition, intelligence warfare, especially the enemy advances, we advance, developing enemy-behind struggle and political offensives, etc. These excellent creations can be fully applied to today's struggle. If they can be widely promoted, they will immediately become an inexhaustible force.

　　Regarding the organizational issues in guerrilla warfare. The first is the issue of unified leadership: History has proven that the county, district, and village command is a very good organizational form for unified struggle against the enemy. Border areas or counties and districts that the Chiang army may invade should best restore or establish this organization. In areas behind enemy lines, establish a unified, lean, and capable armed work team composed of party, government, military, and civilians. The county magistrate and county secretary should concurrently serve as the military and political leaders of the county independent battalion, independent regiment, and district cadre team, respectively, while the original leaders should be reassigned as deputies. The county magistrate and county secretary should be true leaders with authority and power. In this way, the struggles in military, political, and economic aspects will also be consistent and effective. The second is the issue of building county and district core teams: Since the counter-offensive, the county and district cadre teams have been greatly weakened, and guerrilla warfare in the counties and districts has lost its backbone, showing weakness. It is recommended that guerrilla units and core corps in each region maintain a certain ratio, such as a ratio of one to two. The border counties and districts must have deeply rooted cadre teams. When necessary, these cadre teams should draw one or two companies from several core corps to strengthen them as the backbone, but the main corps of the sub-districts should not be weakened. With cadre teams in the counties and districts, their guerrilla groups can be actively active. In areas that the Chiang army may invade, cadres of the county and district cadre teams should be equipped first to carry out organizational preparations. Third, regarding the militia issue: There is already a militia force of nearly one million in the entire region. The biggest current issues are consolidation, transformation, and cultivation of combat effectiveness. Our basic principle for this is that the militia must grow and develop during and on the basis of land reform. The militia's weapons must be controlled by basic, reliable, and emancipated peasants. All gangsters, ruffians, and alien elements who have not been reformed must be resolutely reformed or purged. The militia must earnestly protect the interests of the people and actively participate in productive labor in order to integrate with the masses. In addition, a theory of solely relying on weapons is developing in the militia, which should be overcome. Fourth, the issue of cultivating mass leaders: Without a large number of excellent local cadres and mass leaders, guerrilla warfare cannot be effectively developed, especially in border areas and areas behind enemy lines. In addition, in order to strengthen the struggle in border areas and areas behind enemy lines, it is very important to systematically transfer a large number of cadres with guerrilla warfare experience to strengthen them.

　　Now the battle situation has deepened further. The reactionaries have paid a bloody price of more than ten brigades in exchange for only seventeen empty cities and some points and lines. The vast transportation lines behind enemy lines are very empty and weak. Our main force is becoming stronger and stronger. This is the time to widely develop and strengthen mass guerrilla warfare to cooperate with the main force and annihilate a large number of enemies. We call on all excellent Communist Party members, national warriors, mass leaders, combat heroes, and emancipated heroes in the entire region to contribute our long-trained bodies to the sacred cause of defending our homes, defending the Liberated Areas, and for China's independence, democracy, and freedom, turning hatred into strength, quickly arming ourselves, and going to the rear of the enemy and to the front lines to fight for defending our homes, defending the fruits of victory, and defending the Liberated Areas. Victory must be ours!

### 加强我们爱国自卫的群众游击战争

　　加强我们爱国自卫的群众游击战争
    国民党反动派出动三十八个旅向我晋冀鲁豫解放区全面进攻已近三个月了，目前我们全区有二三十个县的土地上正在猛烈战斗着，战局将继续扩大和残酷，战争的特点是长期性残酷性。我们全体军民必须放弃对美蒋反动派任何和平幻想，一致起来，彻底粉碎蒋介石和美国反动派的进攻，为保卫解放区为中国的独立民主自由而奋斗。我们是正义的人民的爱国自卫战争，我们的胜利基本上是依靠于人民，在军事上，我们依靠于两种力量：主要依靠主力军，集中优势力量各个歼灭敌人，同时也依靠广泛的开展群众性游击战争，配合主力军作战独立坚持一定地区的斗争局面。我们的游击战争，愈能牵制反动派的兵力使之分散配置困守点线不能机动，愈能打击它的补给线，歼灭它的小股部队（从一个班到一个营一个团），愈能打击反动地主武装保护群众利益，则我们的主力军就更加容易集中歼灭敌人，我们就能在广大地区上支持长期的斗争，迅速争取胜利。
    三个月来我们的主力军是有伟大成绩的，六战六捷，歼灭反动派十个旅以上；我们的游击战争也是有成绩的，在晋南顽后游击战争中出现了茅津渡民兵的模范行动，在豫北出现了济源的杜八联，在豫东游击部队坚持了长期艰苦斗争，并于最近再度收复太康城，太行祁太地区的游击战争正威胁着太原近郊，特别重要的是陇海线以北广大地区顽后游击战争现在已经如火如荼的展开了，无数军民正与反动派勇猛搏斗，迫使反动派不得不以十个旅以上的兵力来守备这些点线。此外对于反动派可能进犯地区的游击战争，也正在全力准备和布置，一个巨大的铁锤正准备给予进犯者以猛烈的捶击。这些情况已引起国民党内高级将领中严重的恐惧和动摇，一个蒋军的某高级将领谈称：前进地区均已“赤化”，“匪民”不分，每个村庄均已组织起来，每个村落均要战斗始能占领，到处看不到老百姓。这就是解放区游击战争反映在内战进攻者头脑里的可怕的巨影。
    但应承认：由于我们曾对和平过分的热情，在反动派坚决消灭解放区的全国内战爆发时，我们的准备还是不够的，甚至有些地方对游击战争的机构是弛懈了，这就使我们的游击战争不能很快达到和超过抗日游击战争的水平，适应当前的需要。目前这个缺点，我们已经很快被发觉了，并且正在作有效的改进。为使群众游击战争进一步强化起来，我们特再提出几个问题加以研究。
    必须正确解决游击战争的认识问题。根据几个地区开展群众游击战争的经验，在于解决干部的几个思想问题是必要的：第一、使干部了解战争的长期性和残酷性，对和平单相思对蒋介石美帝国主义有幻想就会犯严重罪过，现在只有斗争只有击退美蒋反动派才能取得真正和平；第二、不要单纯等待主力，主力的任务是集中力量消灭蒋军有生力量，而不是计较一城一镇的得失，不是处处照顾，因此没有主力的地方和暂时或将被蒋军占领的地方，必须依靠游击战争坚持长期斗争，并为主力创造歼灭敌人的有利条件；第三、今天的情况虽与抗战时期不同，但国民党的掠夺屠杀更甚于日本，其内部的矛盾空前严重，我们则有很多有利条件，可以充分开展游击战争，蒋统治区的四川和江南已有几十万武装农民打游击就是很好例子；第四、要随时准备打击反动派的进攻，不是等反动派来了以后再准备，而是有备无患；第五、积小胜为大胜是军区地方部队的主要战斗任务，战斗中必须打有把握的仗，打歼灭仗，即使只歼灭一个班一个排一个连一个营都是歼灭战，都要被奖励发扬，不开展群众性的游击战争，只靠基干团裸体跳舞是错误的。事实已经证明：凡是对于以上几个基本观念弄得愈清楚的地方，游击战争开展得就愈顽强。
    应发扬抗日游击战争的光荣传统。八年抗战我们在群众游击战争中有过伟大惊人的创造，这是我们光荣的传统，今天主要是根据具体情况如何把那些优良的传统继承发扬的问题，比如一元化斗争、联防斗争、空室清野、边沿警备地带工作、地雷战沟道战、麻雀战、飞行爆破、情报斗争，特别是敌进我进，开展敌后斗争和政治攻势等，这些优良的创造完全可以运用到今天的斗争中来，如能广泛的发扬光大起来，那就会立刻成为一种无穷尽的力量。
    关于游击战争中的组织问题。第一是一元化领导问题：历史证明县区村指挥部是统一对敌斗争的很好组织形式，边沿区或蒋军可能入侵的县区最好恢复或建立这种组织。在顽后则建立党政军民统一精干的武装工作队。县独立营独立团区干队等，由县长县书分别兼任其军政首长，原来的首长则改任副职，县长县书应是有职有权名符其实的领导，这样军事政治经济各方面的斗争也会步调一致，效力倍增。第二是县区基干队建设问题：反攻以来县区干队大为减弱，县区游击战争失去了骨干，表现无力，建议各地区游击队与基干兵团应保持一定的比例，比如一与二之比，边沿的县区必须有生根的干队，这些干队必要时应从若干基干兵团中抽出一二个连充实进去作骨干，但分区的主力兵团则不应削弱，县区有了干队其游击集团就可有力的活动了。在蒋军可能侵犯地区，应先配备县区干队的干部进行组织准备。第三关于民兵问题：全区已有一支数近百万的民兵，当前最大的问题是巩固改造和培养战斗力问题，对此我们的基本原则是民兵必须在土地改革中及其基础上生长发展，民兵武器必须为基本的可靠的翻了身的农民所掌握，凡没有经过改造的兵痞流氓及异己分子，必须坚决改造或清洗，民兵必须切实保卫人民利益，又须积极参加生产劳动，才能与群众结合。此外民兵中发展着一种唯武器论，是应注意克服的。第四培养群众领袖问题：没有大量优秀的本地干部和群众领袖，游击战争是不能有力开展的，特别是边沿区顽后要紧。此外为强化边沿区与顽后斗争有计划的抽调大批有游击战争经验的干部去加强，亦是十分重要。
    现在战局更加深入了，反动派以十个旅以上血的代价只换取了十七座空城和若干点线，广大的顽后方交通线非常空虚薄弱，我主力军正愈战愈强，这是广泛开展和强化群众游击战争配合主力大量歼敌的时候了，我们号召全区一切优秀的共产党员、民族战士、群众领袖、战斗英雄、翻身英雄们，以我们久经锻炼之躯，贡献给保卫家乡保卫解放区及为中国的独立民主自由的神圣事业，变仇恨为力量，迅速武装起来到顽后方到前线去，为保卫家乡、保卫胜利果实、保卫解放区而战斗，胜利一定是我们的！
