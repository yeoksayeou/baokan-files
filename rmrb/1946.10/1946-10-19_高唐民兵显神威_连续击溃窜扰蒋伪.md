　　Gaotang Militia Display Divine Power
　　Continuously Defeating Intruding Chiang Kai-shek Puppets
　　[Our Jinnan Weixian Dispatch of the 17th] The puppet and die-hard troops of Yuan Cairong, numbering over 270 men and acting under the instructions of the Kuomintang, have been constantly intruding into the Sixth District of Gaotang to harass and plunder. On the 19th and 21st of last month, they successively surrounded more than ten villages, including Zhangzhuang, Dutun, and Chapeng, looting large quantities of cotton, grain, and draught animals. On the 22nd, the local armed forces of Gaotang, in coordination with the militia, thoroughly routed the invading puppet and die-hard troops, intercepting a cartload of cotton that had been looted. The local government is currently preparing relief for the affected masses. The Third District has also been continuously invaded by the puppet and die-hard troops of Deng and Pang. On the 2nd of this month, Deng Xiechen, in coordination with Yang Jingzhai, led over 700 men to plunder several villages in the south. On the night of the 10th, Pang Changshen led over 70 men to plunder the Liangzhuang area in the south. The militia heroically surrounded the village and, after a day of fierce fighting, repelled them. Many militia combat heroes emerged during the battle. Duan Mingshan, despite being wounded in the hand when he reached the base of the wall, still shouted loudly: "Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed!" After being carried off the front line, he still expressed, "If I recover, I will resolutely take revenge; if I die, it is an honor!"

　　高唐民兵显神威
    连续击溃窜扰蒋伪
    【本报冀南威县十七日电】国民党指示下的伪顽军袁彩荣部二百七十余人，不断到高唐六区窜扰抢夺。上月十九、廿一日先后包围张庄、杜屯、茶棚等十余村，抢去棉粮、耕牛很多。二十二日高唐地方武装配合民兵，将进犯之伪顽军打了个落花流水，截下抢去的棉花一车，当地政府正准备救济受灾群众。三区近亦不断遭伪顽邓、庞等部侵犯，本月二日邓协忱配合杨敬斋七百多人，抢夺南部数村，十日晚突有庞长申部七十余人抢夺南部梁庄一带，当有民兵英勇包围该村，激战一天将其击退。战斗中出现很多民兵战斗英雄，段铭山到围墙根下时虽手部受伤，仍大喊：“缴枪不杀”。抬下火线后，仍表示“好了坚决复仇，死了是光荣的”。
