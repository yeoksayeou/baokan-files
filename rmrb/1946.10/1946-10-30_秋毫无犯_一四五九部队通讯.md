　　Not Even a Hair's Breadth Violated
    Communications from Unit 1459
    On the third night of the month, Unit 1459 was ordered to be stationed at Dongdazhang Village, on the border of Heze. The invading Chiang's army was stationed in Xidazhang Village, three miles away, scaring all the civilians away. During the day, I went around the village. In the empty houses, sheep were still tethered and pigs were penned. Political Instructor Comrade Zhang Zhi led two paralyzed and hungry sheep to the meadow in the west, fed them, and sent them back to the house. The scallions, eggplants, and cabbages in the vegetable garden leisurely faced the early autumn sun; flocks of chicks scurried around on the streets; hens clucked, not knowing where they had laid their eggs, and roosters stretched their necks and announced noon. …Everything was so safe and sound, and no one thought of touching it even with a finger. At the corner, a soldier added a few leftover rice grains to the quail cage.
    I walked to the southwest of the village. The warriors of the Sixth Company were digging fortifications under several pear trees. The pears were already ripe, emitting a rich fragrance, but no one touched them. Next to them, a tree was full of purple-red dates, but no one touched them. The pomegranates in the artillery company and the group's directly subordinate team's courtyard had cracked open, with rows of agate-like fruit grains exposed, but no one touched them. Our warriors are not incapable of enjoying themselves, but they know even more clearly that only by defeating the reactionaries and protecting the people's lives and property can happiness be endless. The people's soldiers spare no blood or sacrifice, all for this firm goal.

　　秋毫无犯
    一四五九部队通讯
    三日黑夜，一四五九部队奉命进驻荷泽边境的东大张村。进犯的蒋军驻在离这里三里的西大张村，把老百姓都吓跑了。白天我绕村一周，没人的家里，还拴着羊，圈着猪。政治指导员张支同志把两只饿瘫了的绵羊，牵到西头的草地里，喂饱后把它重新送回屋里。菜园里的大葱、茄子和白菜，悠然自得地朝着初秋的太阳；鸡雏成群结队地，在街上窜来窜去；母鸡不知在什么地方下了蛋，咯咯地叫，公鸡伸长着脖子在报午。……一切都那样安然无恙，没有任何人想去动它一个指头。在拐角的地方，一个战士把几颗剩饭粒添在鹌鹑笼里。
    我走到村西南，六连的勇士们正在几棵梨树下挖着工事，梨子已经熟透了，喷着浓郁的香息，却没人动他一下，旁边结着满满一树紫红色的枣子，也没有人去动它一下。炮兵连和团直属队、驻院里的石榴都裂开嘴了，成排玛瑙似的果粒露在外面，也没有人去动他一下。我们的勇士们并不是不会享福的，但是他们更清楚的知道，只有把反动派打败，保卫住人民的生命财产，福是享不尽的。人民的战士不惜流血牺牲，全都为了这个坚定不移的目标的。
