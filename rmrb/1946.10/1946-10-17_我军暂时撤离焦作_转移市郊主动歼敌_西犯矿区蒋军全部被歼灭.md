　　【This Dispatch from Changzhi, 15th】 (Delayed) In northern Henan, our army on the 12th at noon, proactively and temporarily withdrew from Jiaozuo, transferring to the suburbs, adopting an encirclement posture against the Chiang troops that had broken into the city, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough annihilation at a favorable opportunity. It is reported that on the morning of the 11th of this month, Chiang's troops, including the 32nd Division, 85th Division, and 38th Division, which had been gathering in Xinxiang, Xiuwu, Huixian, and Wuzhi for a long time, fiercely attacked our Jiaozuo City. Our army immediately put up a frontal resistance, protecting the masses to make an orderly temporary retreat, and moved the main force to predetermined positions, luring the enemy deep to encircle them. On the 12th, our withdrawal work from Jiaozuo was fully completed, and the Chiang troops on the front were still blocked by us in the Zhanggongpu area (more than 30 li east of Jiaozuo). At noon, our army immediately transferred according to the original plan. On the 13th, a portion of the enemy troops continued to flee west to the Lifeng and Wangfeng mining areas in Jiaozuo, where they were completely annihilated by us, and more than 100 people were captured alive. That night, a force of enemy troops from the Wuzhi direction once detoured to Bo'ai, and were driven back by our army on the morning of the 14th. Currently, our main force, in conjunction with the vast number of militia in northern Henan, is launching guerrilla encirclement operations in the suburbs of Jiaozuo City. The scattered Chiang troops will continue to have their living strength annihilated by us. The people of northern Henan are full of strong confidence: "We will continuously annihilate the enemy in large and small groups. Jiaozuo City will ultimately belong to the people of northern Henan, and we will definitely return!"
