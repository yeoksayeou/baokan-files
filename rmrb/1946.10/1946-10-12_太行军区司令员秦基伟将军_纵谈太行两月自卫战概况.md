　　【This article was transmitted by the Taihang Xinhua Branch Office, Changzhi, on the 10th.】 General Qin Jiwei, Commander of the Taihang Military Region, recently returned to the military region from the front line. A reporter from the Taihang Xinhua Branch Office visited him on the 6th to inquire about the battle situation on the Taihang front. General Qin immediately made the following statement:

　　Since the Taihang military and civilians launched a self-defense war in early August, they have achieved brilliant results. Among them, there were three major battles successively: the Meng County Campaign from August 3rd to 7th; the Zhengtai Campaign from August 3rd to 25th; and the Hui County Campaign from August 20th to 22nd.

　　(1) Meng County Campaign: Meng County was originally a place we recovered from the enemy after the counter-offensive. However, the Chiang Kai-shek troops violated the agreement and seized Baipo and Yeshu on January 14th as a bridgehead for their offensive against the entire northern Henan. They expanded more than 20 miles east and west, and 10 miles north, occupying five or six villages along the river and in the mountains. In July and August, they forcibly conscripted civilians to build more than 200 bunkers and dug many blockade ditches and walls, building a strong bridgehead with Baipo as the core and mountain defense lines as the outer perimeter. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in this area were originally the 53rd Division of the 90th Army. In mid-July, after this unit was transferred to attack our Central Plains Military Region, it was taken over by the 17th Brigade (originally a division) of the 38th Division, plus the puppet army Zhang Bohua's troops, with a total strength of more than 3,000 people.

　　In order to combat the stubborn army's encroachment and cooperate with the self-defense operations in various liberated areas, we launched a self-defense offensive, adopting the tactic of drawing firewood from under the pot, destroying its main strongholds, and encircling its mountain bunkers. Starting on the evening of the 3rd, our main forces on the east and west lines, with rapid and sudden actions, broke through the gaps and fiercely attacked the command organs of the Yeshu and Baipo brigade headquarters; on the evening of the 4th, we entered Yeshu and Baipo, captured the deputy brigade commander of the 17th Brigade, and captured the main strongholds of Dianshang, Qingzhuang, Hengjian, and Shunjian; its mountain defense line completely disintegrated, and more than 200 bunkers completely collapsed. Our army concentrated its main force and pressed the stubborn army to the Taimiao Temple between Yeshu and Riren. On the morning of the 6th, we concentrated our forces to annihilate more than 800 people, capturing the stubborn head of the 51st Regiment and its three battalion commanders and a battalion commander of the 49th Regiment. At this point, the stubborn troops only occupied Kangyao and Baipo, resisting stubbornly based on the dangerous terrain. The so-called main force of the 51st Regiment of the 38th Army was completely wiped out.

　　In this battle, we captured 949 people including deputy brigade commanders, killed and wounded 694 people, and seized 6 mortars, 33 small cannons, 16 heavy machine guns, 44 light machine guns, 17 grenade launchers, 448 rifles, 16 pistols, 1 automatic rifle, 2 signal guns, 24 war horses, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, 1 American-style radio station, 12 telephones, 10,000 bags of foreign flour, and many other supplies.

　　(2) Zhengtai Campaign: In order to combat the encroachment of Yan Xishan's puppet troops on our Jinzhong area, and to cooperate with the self-defense counterattacks in southern and northern Shanxi, a part of our main force and more than 20,000 militiamen and self-defense forces, on the evening of August 3rd, braved thunder and torrential rain and cut off the Yushou section of the Zhengtai Road. That night, they captured Shangxiahu, raided the Masou Station, and blew up the Jiangong Bridge. The Jiangong Bridge is one of the largest railway bridges on the Zhengtai Road. The destruction of this bridge prevented Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan from repairing it for several months. On the 4th, we continued to expand the results, attacking Masou; on the 5th, we captured the Longhuashan stronghold (south of Shouyang), reaching the suburbs of Shouyang City, and capturing the Duanting Station in the south; on the evening of the 6th, the stubborn puppet troops at Lujiazhuang fled in panic; at this point, the Zhengtai line, which extended more than 50 miles from the suburbs of Shouyang City in the north to Duanting in the south, was completely controlled by our army. We also carried out large-scale road destruction. At the same time, another unit attacked Baiyangshu Station east of Yangquan, raided Luanliu, and destroyed eight miles of railway between them; on the evening of the 7th, our main force transferred eastward, and on the 8th, we captured Qingquan, Zhangjing, and Qilipu, controlling more than 20 miles of railway. Pingding East also launched a sabotage campaign at the same time. On the 9th, because our mission was completed, we took the initiative to withdraw from the Zhengtai line, and the campaign came to an end. Yan Xishan's puppet troops attempted to retaliate and repeatedly counterattacked in conjunction with Yan Xishan's puppet Japanese troops, but were all repelled by us. In summary, in this campaign, we killed and wounded 1,036 Yan Xishan, puppet, and Japanese troops, captured 277 stubborn troops, 2 Japanese troops, seized 1 mortar, 6 small cannons, 4 heavy machine guns, 19 light machine guns, 274 rifles, 129 shells, more than 21,600 rounds of bullets, 1 radio station, 17 telephones, 43 livestock, destroyed 153 miles of road, blew up 6 bridges, and 3 locomotives.

　　(3) Hui County Campaign: From the night of August 20th to the 22nd, our army launched the Hui County Self-Defense Campaign to cooperate with the annihilation battle north of the Longhai Road, eliminating 25 stubborn army strongholds and bunkers around Hui County, such as Dangcun, and then directly approached the suburbs of the city, once occupying the southeast two passes. When the stubborn reinforcements arrived, we immediately withdrew. In this campaign, we killed and wounded more than 800 stubborn troops and captured 397 people. We seized 1 mountain cannon, 3 heavy machine guns, 10 light machine guns, 6 grenade launchers, 136 rifles, 50,000 rounds of various ammunition, killed 90 mules and horses, and seized 20.

　　During the battle in Dongguan, two squads of the 177th Brigade of the Kuomintang army revolted against the civil war after our frontline appeal. A particularly interesting and meaningful story is about a prisoner: When a certain unit of ours was seriously threatened due to the reinforcement of the stubborn army, a soldier who had just been captured and joined our army hurriedly and enthusiastically said: "Report to the officer, I am from Shandong, my home is in the liberated area, I am a machine gun shooter. I have been in the Kuomintang army for many years, and I have never seen an officer and a soldier fighting together like the Eighth Route Army, sharing weal and woe. Please give me the machine gun, and I will repel the reinforcing enemy." This new comrade had excellent shooting skills, and a few bursts of bullets indeed inflicted great casualties on the stubborn army, repelling the stubborn army and achieving the purpose of our safe transfer. At this point, Commander Qin said affirmatively and forcefully: This little story alone shows the profound truth that our army will win and the Chiang Kai-shek army will be defeated.

　　Commander Qin continued: In August and September, the local armed forces and 200,000 militiamen in various lines of our Taihang area launched extensive guerrilla warfare, actively cooperating with the main force, accumulating small victories into big victories, and playing a significant role in the entire self-defense war, making it impossible for the crazy Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops to plunder food and conscript men from around our area. For example, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in northern Wuzhi and Xiuwu repeatedly invaded Zhongxiamacun in Wuzhi and Jimeng area in Xiuwu, but were repelled by our Fourth Military Sub-district and local armed militiamen. In the Yuanshi area, we recovered villages such as Beisu and Lirenzhuang. In particular, our Qixian Independent Battalion and militiamen, in July and September, successively restored Yan Xishan's puppet strongholds Laiyuan, Pantuo, and Zihong on the Baijin Line, giving the stubborn puppet troops a devastating blow, creating a brilliant example of local corps annihilating the enemy.

　　The broad masses of people, local government and civilian personnel, played their active role in supporting the war, comforting the frontline soldiers. The masses in the war zone all competed to be the first to participate in the war and rescue the wounded. For example, in the Zhengtai Campaign, almost all the masses along the line were mobilized to actively participate in the war and cheer for the victory of our army. During the Hui County Campaign, more than 13,000 militiamen and masses in Hui County participated in the war; during the Meng County Campaign, the masses along the way set up watermelon tables to provide tea to the commanders and fighters, which made our soldiers excited and moved, which was a major factor in our army's victory. At present, a very enthusiastic conscription movement is being launched everywhere, which makes us fully believe that the military and civilians in the liberated areas are absolutely invincible.

　　Speaking of the current situation, Commander Qin said: At this moment, the Kuomintang is greatly increasing its troops in the Xinxiang and Anyang areas, and has transported a large number of munitions. The situation on the southern line of our area is tense again, but I believe that our military and civilians have full confidence in expecting another glorious victory in defeating the stubborn puppet troops!

　　太行军区司令员秦基伟将军
    纵谈太行两月自卫战概况
    【本报长治十日电】太行军区司令员秦基伟将军，日前由前线返抵军区，太行新华分社记者，于六日趋谒，叩询太行前线战况。秦将军当即发表谈话如次：
    八月初太行军民展开自卫作战以来，均获辉煌战果，其中先后进行较大战役三次，即八月三日至七日的孟县战役；三日至二十五日的正太战役；二十日至二十二日的辉县战役。
    （一）孟县战役：孟县本为我反攻后从敌人手中夺回来的地方，蒋军竟违约于元月十四号抢占白坡、冶戍两地，以作其进攻我整个豫北的桥头堡垒。并东西扩展了二十多里，向北扩展了十里，占据了河岸及山地五六个村庄，七、八月来强征民力，修建了二百多处堡垒，挖了许多封锁沟墙，建筑成以白坡为核心、以山地防线为外围的强固桥头堡垒。该地蒋军原为九十军五十三师，七月中旬，该部调往进攻我中原军区后，由三十八师之十七旅（原为师）接防，加上伪军张伯华部，总兵力三千多人。
    我们为了打击顽军蚕食，配合各解放区自卫作战，乃发动自卫攻势，采取了釜底抽薪，摧毁其主要据点，包抄其沿山碉堡。在三日晚开始时，我们东西两线主力部队，以迅速突然动作，突破缺口，猛攻其冶戍、白坡旅团部指挥机关；四号晚，打进冶戍、白坡，俘其十七旅副旅长，攻克了店上、清庄、横涧、顺涧等主要据点；其山地防地，即完全解体，二百多座碉堡完全崩溃。我军集中主力，将顽军压至冶戍，里仁间的太山庙内，于六日晨，集中聚歼八百余人，俘顽五十一团长及其三个营长与四十九团一个营长。至此，顽仅占康窑及白坡据险顽抗。所谓三八军的主力五十一团，即告全部覆灭。
    是役我共生俘副旅长以下九百四十九人，毙伤六百九十四人，缴获迫击炮六门、小炮三十三门、重机枪十六挺、轻机枪四十四挺、掷弹筒十七个、步枪四百四十八支、手枪十六支、自动步枪一支、信号枪二支、战马二十四匹、弹药十万余发，美式电台一架、电话机十二个、洋面万袋，及其他物资甚多。
    （二）正太战役：我为打击阎伪向我晋中蚕食，并配合晋南、晋北之自卫反击，以主力一部及民兵自卫队二万余人，于八月三日晚，冒霹雷暴雨，腰断正太路榆寿段。当晚攻克上下湖，袭入马首车站，炸断建公大桥，建公桥是正太路最大铁桥之一，此桥炸毁，蒋阎数月不能修复。四日继续扩大战果，攻入马首；五日克龙化山据点（寿阳南），进抵寿阳城郊，南克段廷车站；六日晚芦家庄顽伪闻风而逃；至此，北至寿阳城郊之半月村，南至段廷之五十余里正太线，全为我军控制。并大举破路，同时另一部于阳泉之东攻白羊墅车站，袭击乱柳，并破其间铁路八里；七日晚，我主力向东转移，八日攻克芹泉、张净、七里铺，控制铁路二十余里，平（定）东亦同时展开破袭。九日我因任务完成，主动撤离正太线，战役遂告一段落。阎伪妄图报复，曾纠合阎伪日军连续反扑，均被我击退。综合此役，我共毙伤阎、伪、日军一千零三十六人，俘顽军二百七十七人，日军二人，缴迫击炮一门、小炮六门、重机枪四挺、轻机枪十九挺、步枪二百七十四支、炮弹一百二十九发、子弹二万一千六百余发、电台一座、电话机十七架、牲口四十三匹、破路一百五十三里、炸桥六座，车头三个。
    （三）辉县战役：八月二十日夜至二十二日，我军又发动辉县自卫战役，以配合陇海路北之歼灭战，扫除了辉县城周围顽军据点碉堡当村等二十五处，然后直逼城郊，一度攻占东南两关，顽援军赶到，我即撤退，是役总计毙伤顽军八百多，俘三百九十七人。缴山炮一门、重机枪三挺、轻机枪十挺、掷弹筒六个、步枪一百三十六支、各种弹药五万发、毙骡马九十头、缴获二十头。
    在东关战斗中，国民党军一七七旅两个班，经我火线喊话举行反内战起义，特别有趣而有意义的，是一个俘虏的故事：当我某部因顽军增援受到严重威胁时，一个刚被俘参加我军的士兵，急忙而热情的说：“报告官长，我是山东人，家是在解放区，是一个机枪射手，我在国民党军好多年，从未见过像八路军这样官长与士兵一块作战，共同甘苦，请官长把机枪给我，我把增援的敌人打退去。”这个新同志射击技术很好，几梭子弹，果然给了顽军很大杀伤后，把顽军打退了，我达到安全转移之目的。至此，秦司令员肯定而有力地说：只这一个小故事，就表现了我军必胜，蒋军必败的深刻真理。
    秦司令员继称：八、九两月，我太行区各线地方武装及二十万民兵，都展开广泛的游击作战，积极配合主力，积小胜为大胜，在整个自卫战争中，起了很大作用，使疯狂的蒋阎伪军，顾此失彼，无法自我区周围进行粮食与壮丁的掠夺。如果北武陟、修武蒋伪数度出犯武陟中下马村，及修武姬孟一带，均为我四分区部队与地方武装民兵所击退。元氏方面，收复北苏、李仁庄等村。特别是我祁县独立营和民兵，于七、九两月，先后恢复白晋线上阎伪据点来远、盘陀、子洪等，来顽伪以歼灭性的打击，创造地方兵团歼灭敌人的辉煌范例。
    广大群众，地方政民人员，则发挥其积极支援作战、慰劳前线将士，战区群众，无不争先恐后，奋勇参战，抢救伤员。如正太战役，沿线群众几乎全部出动，积极参战，欢呼我军胜利作战。辉县战役中，辉县民兵及群众参战者达一万三十多人；孟县作战中，沿途群众，遍设西瓜桌，给指战员送茶水，均使我军战士兴奋感动，为我军胜利一个重大因素。目前各地又展开极热烈的参军运动，使我们完全相信，解放区军民是绝对不可战胜的。
    谈及目前形势，秦司令员称：刻下国民党在新乡、安阳一带，大肆增兵，并运到大批军火，我区南线形势又告紧张，但我相信我们军民完全有信心期待再度打击顽伪之光辉胜利！
