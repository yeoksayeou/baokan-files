Xinhua News Agency, Lianshui, 16th. This month, a reporter visited a certain General of the Logistics Command of the Hua Zhong Military Region Field Army, who had just returned from the front lines, and received a very detailed account of logistics work. The General first elaborated on the importance of logistics work in the People's Self-Defense War, pointing out that logistics work is a highly organized and educational undertaking, and then went on to talk about the experience of logistics work. He said: "The common people in the Liberated Areas, the so-called 'laborers', have a high level of political consciousness after eight years of the War of Resistance, rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform. They urgently need political education and cultural entertainment." Every civilian laborer would ask the cadres, "Is there any news?" At this time, the cadres would explain the meaning, nature, and future of the self-defense war to them, as well as various knowledge related to self-defense. The songs of "Chiang's Army's Ten Plunders" and "Guarantee the Land, Turn Over to Freedom" could be heard everywhere. In this way, although they were separated from family life for a relatively long period, they were very interested; and they also showed particular bravery in their work. In the Siyang Campaign, 120 stretchers, with 840 people, marched and fought for 20 days, and not a single one fell behind, even in the dark and in the rain while wading through water. They made mutual offers of competition to guarantee the completion of tasks. It is very important to transform the logistics units into a combatant mobile school."

"The Fudong Logistics Detachment Headquarters was headed by the county magistrate himself as the detachment leader. The detachment was divided into brigades, companies, and platoons, with clear division of labor for the cadres and orderly organization. Each team had three to five doctors to treat the logistics personnel at any time, solving the difficulty of getting sick en route. There were also over a hundred elementary school teachers accompanying them, carrying out cultural and recreational activities: composing ditties, drawing pictures, reflecting good and bad examples in the team, giving timely praise and criticism, ensuring that the laborers had food to eat and a place to sleep wherever they went, and always caring about their suffering. Therefore, the logistics team in that county maintained an extremely high morale. To achieve this, one must rely on full preparation and meticulous organizational work."

At this point, the General added: "It is not enough to merely solve the problems of education and organization within the logistics team; it is also necessary to resolve the contradiction between logistics and production so that they can work with peace of mind and without worries. In Guantian Village, Tongxing District, Lianshui, in addition to the militiamen and laborers who went to the front, all men, women, old, and young in the village, along with cattle power, formed a cooperative team, with 40 plows divided into five groups, stipulating that each plow should plow four mu of land per day, rotating in order of the families of martyrs, military dependents, members of the war participation corps, and households providing laborers. Village head Wang Fazhen was the first to take out his own cattle and plow to help others, prompting all cattle-raising households to emulate the village head's exemplary behavior. The village has a total of over 800 mu of wheat fields, of which over 600 mu have been tilled, and the remainder is also planned to be completed within ten days. This spirit of solving production problems by their own efforts, without relying on husbands and sons, is worthy of great praise."

"The self-defense war in the Liberated Areas includes both widespread guerrilla warfare and large-scale mobile warfare. Therefore, in logistics work, there must be first-line supplies, as well as second-line preparations. But on the other hand, it is necessary to save civilian manpower as much as possible and show consideration for the hardships of the people."

　　华中后勤司令某将军
    畅谈后勤工作经验
    要加强时事教育与文娱活动适当解决后勤与生产的矛盾
    【新华社涟水十六日电】本月一日记者往访甫自前线归来之华中军区野战军司令部后勤司令某将军，承告以后勤工作甚详。将军首就后勤工作在全民自卫战争中的重要性加以阐述，指出后勤工作乃是高度的组织工作与教育工作后，继即谈到后勤工作的经验。他说：“解放区老百姓所谓‘夫子’，他们经过八年抗战、减租减息、土地改革，政治觉悟是很高的。他们迫切需要时事教育和文化娱乐。”每个民夫见到干部时总会问：“有什么消息没有？”这时干部们就讲解自卫战的意义、性质与前途，和各种有关自卫的知识给他们听。“蒋军十光”、“保田翻身”的歌声到处可闻。这样，他们虽然比较长期地离开家庭生活，却很有兴趣；在工作中也就表现得特别勇敢。泗阳战役中，一百二十付担架，八百四十人，在二十天行军战斗中，即在黑夜与下雨涉水时也没有一个掉队的。他们互相提出竞赛，保证任务完成。变后勤部队为一个战斗的流动的学校，是十分重要的。”
    “阜东后勤支队司令部由县长亲任支队长，支队下分大队、中队、小队，干部分工明确，亦井然有序。每一个队都带有三个至五个医生，随时给后勤人员医病，解决了途中生病的困难。并有百余小学教员随行，进行文娱活动：编小调，画图画，把队中好坏例子反映出来，及时加以表扬和批评，每至一处，使民夫有饭可吃，有处可睡，随时关心他们的痛苦。因此该县后勤队始终保持着极高的情绪。要作到这样，就依靠充分的准备与精密的组织工作。”
    至此，将军又说：“仅仅解决了后勤队内部的教育与组织问题，仍然是不够的；还必须解决后勤与生产的矛盾，这样才能使他们安心工作，无后顾之忧。涟水同兴区官田村，除上前线的民兵民夫外，把全村所有男女老幼连牛力组成一个合伙队，四十张犁，分成五个组，规定每天每张犁地四亩，按烈属军属参战团员及出夫户依次轮排。村长王发珍首先把自己的牛犁拿出来帮助别人，推动所有养牛户都效法村长的模范行为。该村共麦田八百余亩，已有六百余亩耕好，所余者亦准备于十天之内完成。这种不依赖丈夫儿子，自己动手解决生产问题的精神，值得大大表扬。”
    解放区的自卫战争，有普遍的游击战，又有大规模的运动战。因此，在后勤工作上有了第一线的供应，还要有第二线的准备。但另一方面，又要尽可能的节约民力，体恤民艰。”
