　　【News from Cixian County, this paper】 Through the land reform movement, military families, cadre families, and honorably discharged veterans in this county have generally received sufficient land and have settled down well with the voluntary help of the masses. Zhao Fubao, an honorably discharged veteran from Qiang Village, Eleventh District, recently voluntarily requested the government to stop issuing his preferential grain rations. He said, "The masses have been emancipated, and I have been emancipated along with them. I can farm the land myself, and the grain I harvest is enough for my own consumption. There is no need to let the masses bear the burden for me anymore!" The family of Comrade Hu Pengbin from a certain unit used to receive relief grain, but recently they also wrote to the government saying, "I have settled down in Majiazhuang, Eighth District. With the help of the masses, I now have land, houses, and the necessary clothing. My family problem has been solved, and a heavy burden has been lifted from my heart, making me feel relaxed and happy. Please cancel my relief grain to avoid wasting public grain." Both comrades are now actively making production plans and starting to rely on their own efforts. The county government recently issued a special circular commending these two comrades and calling on all villages to quickly help military families, cadre families, and veterans to all obtain land and settle down well; the military families themselves, etc., are required to learn from the spirit of these two comrades, work hard to build their families, and move towards the path of self-reliance, overcoming the erroneous concepts of simply relying on others and looking down on labor.

　　磁县军属干属均获土地
    自动请求解除优待
    【本报磁县讯】本县经过土地改革运动，一般军属、干属、荣退军人均已获得足够之土地，并在群众自动帮助下很好的安了家。十一区ｑｉāｎｇ＠①村荣退军人赵富保最近自动请求政府停发其优待粮。他说：“群众翻了身，我也跟着翻了身。我自己能种地，打下粮食也足够吃用，不要再让群众给我负担了！”某部胡蓬宾同志之家属过去吃救济粮，最近也写信给政府说：“我已在八区马家庄安了家，经群众帮助，我已有了土地、房屋与所需衣物，我的家庭问题解决了，我心里去掉一个重担，感到轻松愉快。即请取消我的救济粮，以免消耗公粮。”这两位同志现均在积极订生产计划，开始自力更生。县府日前特通令表扬该二位同志，并号召各村迅速帮助抗属、干属乐退军人等全部获得土地，安好家；抗属等本身，则要求学习该二同志精神，努力建设家务，向自力更生之路前进，克服单纯依赖与轻视劳动之错误观念。（县府办公室）
