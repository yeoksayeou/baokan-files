　　【Changzhi Dispatch, This Newspaper, 20th】More than a thousand troops from the puppet Li Ying unit stationed in Huixian and the Huixian Chiang Kai-shek die-hard Security Regiment, on the 14th, attacked Baima (more than forty li from Huixian), and were intercepted at Xiaozhangzhuang by our local armed forces. Eight Chiang Kai-shek and puppet platoon and company leaders and below were killed, more than thirty were wounded, and eleven were captured alive. Also, on the same day at night, a unit of our local corps on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway once raided the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet stronghold of Gaojiazhuang, west of Yuanshi, killing and wounding more than fifty Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppet soldiers. In the above two battles, our local corps suffered no casualties.
　　【Report from the Jiluyu Frontline Reporter Corps, This Newspaper, 19th】Guerrilla warfare behind Chiang Kai-shek's army has been widely launched. On the 11th, a unit of our independent brigade ambushed near XInji, intercepting five vehicles of the 75th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army under Liu Jimin, capturing five Chiang Kai-shek army lieutenants and below, and seizing fifty bags of rice, more than six hundred signal flares, and many other military supplies. We suffered no casualties. The soldiers cheerfully said: "This is the welcoming gift from the 75th Division as they reinforced the area."
　　【Handan Dispatch, This Newspaper, 20th】The local guerrilla groups in eastern Henan are actively disrupting the enemy's transportation lines. On the 5th, a unit, in coordination with the local militia, destroyed the railway between Xiangzhai (east of Neihuang) and Xihukou on the Longhai Railway, a major transportation line of the Kuomintang. On the 7th, a unit of our military sub-district blew up the Yangji (west of Dangshan) railway bridge, rendering that section of the line unusable for a week.
