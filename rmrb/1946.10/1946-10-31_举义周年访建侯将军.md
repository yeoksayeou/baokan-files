Visiting General Gao Jianhou on the Anniversary of the Uprising
    Li Zhuang

    Today marks the anniversary of General Gao Jianhou leading the New Eighth Army in an anti-civil war uprising in Handan. The history of the Northwest Army has since turned a new and glorious page.

    For a year, none of the propositions put forward by General Gao in the telegram of the Democratic National Construction Army—opposing civil war and realizing peace; opposing dictatorship and realizing democracy; and organizing a coalition government—have been realized. "What are General Gao's thoughts on this situation?" I went to visit him with this question in mind.

    General Gao told me the following: Last year, when the Japanese surrendered, he led his troops north across the Yellow River. Along the way, he saw many puppet soldiers wearing Japanese uniforms and hats who had all become "Nationalist soldiers," which he found extremely offensive. A few days ago, he went to Handan and saw a Chiang army officer who had just laid down his weapons wearing an American uniform and an American-style hat. General Gao suddenly recalled how he felt when he saw those puppet soldiers last year. He shook his head with pain and contempt: "This is a disgrace to soldiers; national and personal dignity have been lost completely."

    General Gao believes that the failure to realize his propositions is due to the United States and Chiang Kai-shek. "The United States should not have come to China to accept the surrender in the first place. The Japanese prisoners had already been sent away, and the U.S. military should have left immediately. As long as the U.S. military doesn't leave, the Chinese civil war will not stop. The U.S. military's presence in China violates Roosevelt's policy; it wants to turn China into its colony. Chiang Kai-shek has given everything to the United States, hoping that the United States will help him fight the civil war to the end." General Gao said, "Demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China is justified, proper, and requires the joint efforts of the people of the whole country." He immediately added, "It is not enough for the U.S. military to withdraw from China. The United States' political oppression, economic aggression... must all withdraw from China. We want a truly independent China; we cannot be constrained by any country."

    "Chiang Kai-shek's eight demands completely destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. He wants to reopen negotiations based on these eight demands, which the people of the whole country will never allow. Today eight demands, tomorrow ten, and the day after tomorrow twenty—will there ever be an end? I said long ago that this is all a deception." General Gao said: "The CCP Central Committee's statement of October 17th was made in response to the eight demands. This statement is the clearest and most minimal demand, and only by thoroughly implementing this statement can true peace be achieved."

    General Gao opposes the Kuomintang convening a one-party-controlled National Assembly. "Those representatives are all hand-picked. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, some became traitors and some have already died; how can this represent the will of the people? Only a coalition government can be formed, and representatives elected through universal suffrage are genuine." He advocates that "if the Kuomintang convenes a National Assembly that cannot represent the will of the people, the liberated areas should convene a people's representative conference that truly represents the will of the people."

    General Gao has been in the military for more than thirty years, and his footprints have covered the entire country. He said: "In the old society, the military, political, economic, and cultural... measures I saw were all aimed at oppressing and exploiting the people. The situation I saw in the Chiang-occupied areas during the last three years of the eight-year War of Resistance was even worse; it can be said to be a compilation of all the bad things in history. There, officials, regardless of rank, all consider it an honor to rake in as much money as possible, resulting in bandits everywhere. The old and weak are left to die in ditches, while the young and strong take risks." General Gao described the situation of the Kuomintang army with a sorrowful expression: "There, officers and soldiers are in opposition to each other. Officers do not treat soldiers as human beings; seven or eight out of ten soldiers are conscripted, and desertion is rampant. Their combat effectiveness and morale are shockingly weak. A wide gap separates the military and the people; their antagonism is beyond the imagination of ordinary people."

    General Gao has been stationed in the liberated areas for a full year. "This is a new society. I see the Three Principles of the People here." He said: "Here, the principle of 'land to the tiller' has been initially implemented. Everyone is moving towards having enough food and clothing. There are no beggars and no one without food to eat. It can be said that 'no one picks up lost articles on the road, and doors are not closed at night.' Officials have become true public servants of the people. From Chairman Mao to the village chief, no individual has any private savings or property. They work diligently, thriftily, and conscientiously for the people all day long."

    The army in the liberated areas has also given General Gao many new impressions. "Here, officers and soldiers are closely united. Treating soldiers like younger brothers, and respecting officers like elder brothers. New soldiers voluntarily join their units. They join the army to protect their own interests, so there is no desertion. The relationship between the military and the people is harmonious and seamless. The army protects the lives and property of the people and takes time out from combat and rectification to help the people with farming. The troops themselves also engage in various kinds of production to reduce the burden on the people. On the part of the government and the people, they automatically help the army solve various difficulties and pay close attention to giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. The entire military, government, and people are united like a harmonious family."

    Speaking of the progress of the Democratic National Construction Army in the past year, General Gao's tone was high and full of joy and happiness. He said: "Our troops were the same as the Kuomintang troops before the uprising. After a year of rectification and training since the uprising, a basic concept has been established in the entire army: our troops are the armed forces of the people and serve the people. During the busy farming season, the entire army is mobilized to help the masses in the garrison area with the autumn harvest. The democratic government and the local people also help our troops in many ways. Therefore, the relationship between the military and the people has changed from the opposition of the past to the harmony of the present. We have launched a democratic movement in the troops. Soldiers have the opportunity and status to speak, and officers wholeheartedly care for the soldiers. The relationship between officers and soldiers has also changed from the opposition of the past to unity. Especially in the past six months, the atmosphere of harmony and friendship in the troops is unprecedented in my decades of leading troops." At this point, a relaxed and profound smile appeared between General Gao's stern eyebrows, symbolizing that the future of the Democratic National Construction Army is infinitely bright and long-lasting.

### 举义周年访建侯将军

　　举义周年访建侯将军
    李庄
    去年今日，高建侯将军率新八军在邯郸举行反内战起义。西北军的历史，从此掀开了新的光辉的一页。
    一年了，高将军在民主建国军通电上提出的反对内战、实现和平；反对独裁、实现民主和组织联合政府的主张，一条都没有实现。“高将军对这种情况有什么感想呢？”我怀着这样的心情去访问他。
    高将军告诉我这么一件事：去年日寇投降，他率部渡河北上，沿途看见许多伪军穿日本衣服，戴日本帽子，却都成了“国军”，觉得非常刺眼。前些天去邯郸见到一个刚放下武器的蒋军军官身着美国制服，头戴美国大盖帽子，高将军猛然想起去年看见那些伪军时的心情，他痛心而卑弃的摇摇头：“这是军人的耻辱，国格人格都丧失无余了。”
    高将军认为他的主张未能实现，都是美国和蒋介石造成的。“美国最初就不该到中国来受降。日俘早就送完了，美军应该马上走。美军不走，中国内战就不会停止。美军驻华违背罗斯福的政策，它想把中国变成它的殖民地，蒋介石把一切的一切都给了美国，希望美国帮他把内战打到底。”高将军说：“要求美军退出中国是正当的，应该的，需要全国人民一起努力。”他马上又补充说：“光美军退出中国是不够的。美国的政治压迫，经济侵略……都要退出中国。我们要一个真正的独立中国，我们不能受任何国家的牵制。”
    “蒋介石的八项要求，彻头彻尾的破坏了政协决议。他想根据这八项要求重开谈判，全国人民绝不允许。今天八项，明天十项，后天二十项，还有个完吗？我早说过，这都是骗人的。”高将军说：中共中央十月十七日的声明，就是针对八项要求而提出。这个声明是最明确、最低限度的要求，彻底实现这个声明，才能取得真正的和平。”
    高将军反对国民党召开一党包办的国大。“那些代表都是圈定的。抗战八年，有的当了汉奸，有的已经死了，这怎么能代表民意；只有成立了联合政府，经过普选产生的代表才是真的。”他主张“国民党如果召开不能代表民意的国大，解放区就应该召开真正代表民意的人民代表会议。”
    高将军治军三十余年，足迹遍全国。他说：“我在旧社会里看到的军事、政治、经济、文化……一切措施，均以压迫、剥削人民为能事。八年抗战的后三年，我在蒋占区看到的情形更糟糕，可说集历史上一切坏的大成。那里官无大小，都以刮钱多为光荣。弄得土匪如毛，老弱转乎沟壑，青壮挺而走险。”高将军面带戚色的叙述国民党军队的情况：“那里官兵对立，官长对士兵不当人看，十个兵有七八个是抓来的，逃之成风，战力战志惊人微弱。军民间横阻一道鸿沟，其对立情况实非一般人所可想像。”
    高将军移驻解放区已经整整的一年，“这是一个新的社会，我在这里看到了三民主义。”他说：“这里初步实行了耕者有其田。人人走向丰衣足食，没有乞丐，没有无饭吃的人。可谓“路不拾遗，夜不闭户。”官吏成为真正的人民公仆，从毛主席到村长，个人没有任何的私蓄或私产，终日勤恳俭朴、兢兢业业的为人民服务。”
    解放区的军队也给了高将军许多新的印象。“这里的官兵是亲密团结的。带兵如带弟，尊干如尊兄。新战士自愿的参加自己的部队，他们为了保卫自己的利益而参军，所以没有逃亡的现象。军民关系是融洽无间，军队保护人民的生命财产，并抽出战斗与整顿的时间，帮助人民耕作。部队本身也从事各种生产，以减轻人民负担。在政府和人民方面则自动帮助军队解决各种困难，并十分注意优待军人家属。整个军政民之间，团结得像个和睦的家庭一样。”
    说到民主建国军一年来的进步，高将军声调高吭，充满欢欣愉快的情绪。他说：“我们这个部队，在起义以前和国民党的部队是一样的。举议后经过一年的整训，在全军中已经树立了一个基本的观念：我们的部队是人民的武装，是为人民服务的。在农忙时候，全军上下一致动员帮助驻地群众秋收。民主政府和当地人民也多方帮助我们的部队。因此军民关系由过去的对立一变而为现在的融洽了。我们在部队中开展了民主运动，士兵有了说话的机会和地位，官长也尽心的爱护士兵。官兵关系也由过去的对立变得团结了。特别是最近半年以来，部队中和睦友爱的空气，更为过去带兵数十年来所未见。”谈到这里，高将军威峻的眉字间泛起一阵轻松深邃的笑纹，象征着民主建国军的前途，是无限的光明和久远。  三五·十·卅
