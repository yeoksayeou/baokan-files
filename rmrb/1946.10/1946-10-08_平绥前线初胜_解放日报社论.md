　　Initial Victory on the Ping-Sui Front
    Liberation Daily Editorial
    Good news has arrived! Our heroic soldiers of the Ji-Cha-Jin Military Region, east of Huailai City, annihilated the entire 325th Regiment and part of the 329th Regiment of the 109th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 16th Army, and routed the main force of the 94th Division. They killed, wounded, and captured over 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and seized a large amount of American equipment, including tanks, anti-tank guns, heavy mortars, and more. This is the second major victory for our army in just one week, following the victory in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, striking a heavy blow against Chiang Kai-shek's army's reckless attack on Zhangjiakou. This is the first major victory in directly blocking Chiang's attacking forces on the Ping-Sui line. This victory fully demonstrates the great strength of the people and soldiers of the liberated areas in bravely defending Chahar and Zhangjiakou. It will further greatly boost the confidence of the entire Chinese people, especially the people and soldiers of the liberated areas, in resolutely crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. In our joy, we extend our respects to the heroic soldiers of the Eighth Route Army on the Ping-Sui front! We extend our respects to the militia and mass heroes who effectively coordinated with the main forces in combat!
    The victory at Huailai shattered Chiang Kai-shek's dream of easily seizing Zhangjiakou. Chiang Kai-shek issued a hand order on September 10th to the Peiping Pacification Headquarters and the Eleventh and Twelfth War Zones to deploy an attack on Zhangjiakou, setting a deadline for its "recovery." On September 25th, the deployment was completed, and on the 29th, he issued a general offensive order, advancing on Zhangjiakou from three directions in a combined attack, expecting to take Zhangjiakou in one fell swoop, making "the 300,000 Communist troops under Nie Rongzhen's command become turtles in a jar." However, contrary to Chiang Kai-shek's expectations, our army in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, from September 29th to October 3rd, launched a sudden attack with lightning speed, causing a serious threat to the rear of Chiang's army, forcing them to divert an army to defend Baoding, thus hobbling one of his legs. Now that his head has just touched the outer perimeter of Zhangjiakou in the Kangzhuang area, he has immediately been struck with such a heavy blow. This cannot but greatly shake his offensive system against Zhangjiakou and greatly undermine his already low morale!
    Chiang's army used dozens of artillery pieces in this attack on Huailai, firing thousands of shells, coupled with indiscriminate bombing by American planes. The intensity of the firepower was unprecedented in the civil war in recent months. However, in the face of the invincible people's army, American weapons are useless. The fierce artillery fire of Chiang's army could not shake our army's position in the slightest. A large number of American artillery pieces have instead become our army's spoils of war. In the battle, the soldiers of the Ji-Cha-Jin Military Region have become even stronger, and their combat effectiveness has been further enhanced. Hundreds of thousands of militiamen are pouring into the battle, increasingly demonstrating their power! In the vast areas of Rehe, Jidong, Jizhong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, the people and soldiers of the liberated areas are actively cooperating in the defense of Chahar and Zhangjiakou. The Chiang armies in these areas have been subjected to effective counterattacks or containment, falling into a passive or beaten plight. We can assert that the Battle of Huailai is only the beginning of Chiang's more tragic failure. Annihilating blows like the Battle of Huailai, and even more severe than the Battle of Huailai, will continue to occur in the near future. Those who "become turtles in a jar" will not be others, but surely the Chiang armies that invade Zhangjiakou!
    General Zhou Enlai has long declared that if Chiang Kai-shek attacks Zhangjiakou, it will be tantamount to announcing a complete split. Now Chiang Kai-shek is recklessly attacking Zhangjiakou, taking the great risk of offending the world and announcing a complete split. But, most ridiculously, he has a guilty conscience. When his military offensive suffers major setbacks and he is politically condemned by democrats at home and abroad, he releases an air of peace talks, in order to cover up his offensive actions and defeats. Chiang Kai-shek is also attempting to use this to paralyze the people and soldiers of the liberated areas, taking advantage of our unpreparedness to seize Zhangjiakou and other places, while seizing the opportunity to extensively rest and replenish his troops, in order to launch a larger-scale offensive against the liberated areas. Chiang Kai-shek even mobilized his propaganda organs and spokespersons to deny that he had any plans or actions to attack Zhangjiakou, or to say that he could stop the attack on Zhangjiakou at any time. When Chiang Kai-shek felt that Zhangjiakou was within easy reach, he arrogantly publicized the attack on Zhangjiakou, but when the attack encountered difficulties and setbacks, he wanted to cover it up in order to continue the attack secretly. Chiang Kai-shek's desperate and boring ugly performance is enough to expose that his difficulties are growing. The US and Chiang Kai-shek suddenly agreed to convene the Three-Man Committee, merely to make up for these difficulties, and as a smokescreen for intensifying the offensive. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly broken his promises, and he has no sincerity for peace. Chiang Kai-shek has refused to guarantee to stop the attack on Zhangjiakou. His army is still attacking after being wounded in Huailai. We, the people and soldiers of the liberated areas, should see through the double act of Chiang and the US: when Chiang's army attacks, Marshall lets him do it; when Chiang's army suffers setbacks, he comes out to step up "mediation." This trick cannot deceive the people and soldiers of the liberated areas. Unless Chiang Kai-shek withdraws from the areas illegally occupied after January 13th and withdraws the illegally deployed troops, the people and soldiers of the liberated areas will never stop the war of self-defense. We will continue to fight until we completely crush Chiang's offensive!

　　平绥前线初胜
    解放日报社论
    捷报传来，我英勇的冀察晋子弟兵于怀来城东，歼灭了蒋军十六军的一零九师三二五团全部和三二九团的一部，并击溃了九十四师的主力，毙伤俘蒋军三千余人，缴获大量的美国装备，包括坦克，反坦克炮、重迫击炮等等。这是短短一周之中，我军继平汉北段之捷，打击蒋介石军猛犯张垣的第二次大胜利，这是在平绥线上直接阻击蒋家进攻部队的首次大胜利。这一胜利，充分表现出解放区军民英勇保卫察哈尔，保卫张家口的伟大力量，它更将大大鼓舞全中国人民，首先是解放区军民坚决粉碎蒋介石进攻的信心。我们于欢喜之余，谨向平绥前线的八路军英勇将士们致敬！向有力配合主力作战的民兵和群众英雄们致敬！
    怀来之捷，粉碎了蒋介石轻易攫取张家口的梦想。蒋介石于九月十日就手令北平行辕和第十一、十二两战区部署向张垣进攻，限期收复”。九月廿五日部署就绪，二十九日即下总攻令，分三路向张家口分进合击，预期一鼓而下张垣，使“聂荣臻统帅之三十万共军尽成为瓮之中龟”。但是，出于蒋介石的意料之外，九月二十九日至本月三日的平汉北段我军，以迅雷之势突然出击，使蒋军后方感到严重威胁，不能不调一个军去防卫保定，这样他的一条腿就被拖住了。现在他的头刚刚在康庄一带触到张垣外围，又立即挨上这么重重的一棒，这不能不大大动摇了他对张垣的进攻体系，不能不大大打击了他原已低落的士气！
    蒋军这次进犯怀来用了几十门大炮，发了几千发炮弹，再加上美式飞机滥肆轰炸，火力之猛，为几月来内战中所仅见；但是，在无敌的人民军队前，美国武器是不中用的，蒋军猛烈炮火，竟不能丝毫动摇我军的阵地，大量的美式大炮，反而成为我军的战利品。在战斗中，晋察冀子弟兵更加壮大起来了，战斗力更加强了，几十万民兵正在涌入战斗，日益发挥其威力！在热河、冀东、冀中、山西、绥远等广大地区内，解放区军民都在积极配合察哈尔和张家口的保卫战，这些地方的蒋军都受到有力的反击或牵制，陷入于被动或挨打的窘境。我们可以断言，怀来之役仅仅是蒋军更悲惨的失败的开始，像怀来战役那样以及比怀来战役更厉害的歼灭性的打击，在最近的将来，还将继续严重。“成为瓮中之龟”的，将不是别人，而决然是进犯张家口的蒋军！
    周恩来将军早已声明过，蒋介石如进攻张家口，即等于宣布全面破裂。现在蒋介石已经在猛犯张家口的行动，甘冒天下的大不韪，宣布全面破裂了。但是，最可笑的，他做贼心虚，当他的军事进攻遭受到重大挫折，在政治上遭受国内外的民主人士一致谴责的时候，他却又放出和平谈判的空气，借以掩盖他的进攻行动和挫败。蒋介石并企图以此麻痹解放区军民，乘我不备侵占张家口和其他地方，同时取得机会大休整和补充他的部队，以便向解放区作更大规模的进攻。蒋介石甚至动员他的宣传机关和代言人，否认他有进攻张家口的计划和行动，或者说他随时有停止进攻张家口的可能。当蒋介石感觉到张垣垂手可得的时候，他曾趾高气扬地大肆宣传对张家口的进攻，但当进攻遇到困难和挫败的时候，便想掩盖起来，以便偷偷摸摸地继续进攻。蒋介石此种穷极无聊的丑态，适足以暴露他的困难正在日益增长。美方和蒋介石忽然同意召开三人委员会，仅仅是为了弥补这些困难，和当作加紧进犯的烟幕。蒋介石历次背信弃义，他对于和平是丝毫没有诚意的。蒋介石已拒绝了停止进攻张家口的保证，他的军队在怀来受创之后，还在继续进犯，我们解放区军民应当识破蒋美的双簧戏：当蒋军进攻时，马歇尔放手让他大干；当蒋军受挫时，便出来加紧“调解”。这种把戏是骗不了解放区军民的，除非蒋介石撤出一月十三日后非法侵占的地区，及撤回非法调动之军队，解放区军民决不停止自卫战争，我们要一直战斗下去，直至彻底粉碎蒋军进攻为止！
