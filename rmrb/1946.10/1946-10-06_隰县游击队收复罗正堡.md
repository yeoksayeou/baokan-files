　　Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 3rd. The Guerrilla forces in the Xi (County) area attacked the Yan army entrenched in Luo Zheng Fort, located in the central area of Xi (County), Yong (He), and Shi (Lou) counties, on September 24th, annihilating them completely. The area was thus recovered. Over 70 Yan soldiers were captured, along with several light machine guns and over a dozen rifles. On the 2nd of this month, over 700 Yan soldiers stationed in Xi County, Da＠, and Yonghe launched a combined attack on the area from multiple directions. They found nothing and advanced deeply, only to be ambushed and annihilated by the Eighth Route Army. They immediately fled back to their original positions in different directions.
