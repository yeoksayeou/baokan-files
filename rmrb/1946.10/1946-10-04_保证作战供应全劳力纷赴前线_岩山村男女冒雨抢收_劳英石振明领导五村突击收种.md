　　Guarantee Combat Supply, All Laborers Rush to the Front Line
    Yanshan Village Men and Women Brave Rain to Rush Harvest
    Labor Hero Shi Zhenming Leads Five Villages in a Crash Harvest and Planting
    Sharpening Sickles at the Second Watch, Departing Before Dawn; This Year's Autumn Harvest is Twice as Fast as Last Year
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng Dispatch, 1st] The autumn crops are yellow, and the patriotic self-defense war is even more intense. The men and women, old and young, of Yanshan Village all clearly see that "without victory on the front line, there will be no autumn harvest in the rear." Therefore, when Mutual Aid Team Leader Shangguan Zhongyou proposed supporting the front line, all 140 full laborers in the team automatically went to the front line to take on transportation duties (the team originally had 409 full and semi-laborers). The strength of the mutual aid team was newly allocated. The 156 semi-laborers who had not participated in the mutual aid team in the past also joined, after being mobilized by their relatives. Then, they were divided into seven detachments to carry out the autumn harvest. In order to concentrate strength, three to five families united, leaving an elderly person or child to cook. The Gaigehe detachment, with 58 households, left only seven women to cook. The young girl, Gai Yinhua, also cooked meals for three families on time. On the 16th, the team began harvesting millet, and they ate breakfast before dawn. Breastfeeding babies were also placed in cradles and baskets, and taken to the fields. Yanshan Street, a li long from east to west, was quiet, with no people in sight, only wisps of smoke floating in the morning light. People gathered in the fields to form a harvesting team, and patches of millet lay on the ground with the swing of their sickles. Children followed their mothers to pick beans and millet ears. The next day, it rained heavily, and the Shangguan Tingkui detachment of 36 people braved the rain to harvest 36 mu of millet. On this day, the Niu Meixiang women's detachment got up the earliest. When Shangguan Zhongyou got up, he saw a black mass of people walking from the center of the street towards the outside of the village. The youth An Xiaoshang detachment retorted, unwilling to be outdone, and sharpened their sickles and went to the fields at the second watch that night. By dawn on the 18th, six mu of millet had been harvested by their 16 people. The competition between the detachments promoted the speed of harvesting. 1,300 mu of millet were harvested in only four days, shortening the time by one and a half days compared to last year. The masses in the village all said: "This year is a great joint rush harvest for the liberated peasants." Now, the team is starting to plant wheat on the one hand, and continuing to harvest corn, cotton, and other miscellaneous grains on the other hand. They have proposed: "Carry manure when going to the fields, and carry grain when returning home." All the manure for 1,000 mu of wheat land has been carried to the fields. Shangguan Fengyun, who has been liberated, has the greatest energy and the greatest achievements. According to Shangguan Zhongyou's estimation, all autumn crops can be harvested in just one and a half months. The reporter visited Team Leader Shangguan Zhongyou to inquire about the harvest situation this year. He said very excitedly: "This is the first bumper harvest in ten years." Shangguan Zhongyou's family of three were laborers with only one mu of bad land three years ago. In 1944, the democratic government allocated him two mu of land confiscated from traitors, and he also rented four mu of land and reclaimed two mu of wasteland. He worked carefully and happened to encounter a bumper harvest that year. The nine mu of land yielded 14 dan of grain. Later, after rent reduction and debt clearing, he has now become a well-to-do middle peasant with 12 mu of land, two cows, and a mule. This year, his five mu of millet land yielded 15 dan of millet, and two mu of corn yielded 7 dan. The cotton and miscellaneous grains were all doubled compared to last year. Because Shangguan Zhongyou organized land leveling and dike building, adding ten workdays, so that the transplanted soil exceeded the ground by two inches, not only was the fertilizer in the field not washed away by rainwater, but also more water was stored for the wheat seedlings. In addition, he applied ten more loads of fertilizer per mu than in previous years, and paid attention to cultivating the soil around the roots of the seedlings and meticulous farming, so his yield was particularly high. He estimates that the grain from this year's autumn harvest alone will be enough for his whole family to eat for two and a half years.
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng Dispatch, 2nd] Shi Zhenming, the famous labor hero of Fushan, led the masses in a crash autumn harvest and planting during the tense war. He completed three-quarters of the work in seven days, exceeding the original plan. After receiving the urgent instructions from the Administrative Office to rush the autumn harvest and planting to support the front line, Shi Zhenming immediately convened a mobilization meeting of the joint mutual aid team of five villages on the 21st, organizing all the semi-laborers (women, children, and old men) and peddlers to rush the unfinished autumn harvest and planting, and drew 300 militiamen from the self-defense force to rush to the self-defense battlefield. In the meeting, it was originally planned to plant 7,000 mu of wheat in ten days and harvest more than 9,000 mu of autumn fields in 20 days. But due to everyone's doubled efforts, three-quarters of the work has been completed in seven days, each mu of wheat land has been plowed twice, harrowed four times, and applied with seventy loads of manure.

　　保证作战供应全劳力纷赴前线
    岩山村男女冒雨抢收
    劳英石振明领导五村突击收种
    二更里磨镰天不明出发今年秋收比去年快一倍
    【本报阳城一日电】秋庄稼黄了，爱国自卫战争更紧张了。岩山村的男女老幼都看清了“没有前线的胜利就没有后方的秋收”，所以互助大队长上官中有一提出支援前线，大队中一百四十个全劳力就都自动到前线去担任运输（大队原有全半劳力四百零九人）。互助大队的力量作了新的配备，过去没有参加互助队的一百五十六个半劳力，经过他们亲戚的动员，也参加了，接着分为七个分队，进行秋收。为了集中力量，三五家联合起来，留一个老人或小孩做饭。盖家河分队五十八户，仅留了七个做饭的妇女。小闺女盖银花也按时做好三家人的饭。十六日大队开始割谷子，天不明就吃了早饭。哺乳的婴儿们也被装在摇车里、筐子里，带着上地。东西一里长的岩山街静悄悄地，不见人影，只见缕缕炊烟在晨曦里飘扬。人们在地里集成一支收割的队伍，一片片的谷子随着他们镰刀的挥动躺在地上，小孩则跟在母亲后面拾豆角和谷穗。第二天雨很大，上官廷魁分队三十六人在冒着雨抢割了三十六亩谷子。这天，牛美香妇女分队起得最早，当上官中有起来时，就看见黑蠕蠕的一群从街心向村外走去。青年安小尚分队却道了，不服气，当晚二更天就磨好镰刀上地，到十八日天明六亩谷子已为他们十六个人割完了。各分队间的竞赛促进了收割的速度，一千三百亩谷子只四天就已收割完毕，较去年缩短了一天半时间，该村群众都说：“今年是大联合抢收翻身秋。”现在大队正一面开始种麦，一面继续收割玉茭、棉花及其他杂粮。他们曾提出：“上地他捎粪，回家捎谷”，一千亩麦地的粪已全部担到地里。翻身后的上官逢运劲头最大，成绩也最大。据上官中有估计，仅需一个半月时间全部秋禾即可收割完毕。记者曾访问上官中有大队长询以今年的收获情形，他很兴奋的说：“这是十年来的第一次丰收。”上官中有全家三口人，三年前还是仅有一亩坏地的雇工，卅三年得到民主政府分给他的二亩没收汉奸的土地，又租种了四亩地、开了二亩荒；他细心作务恰遇当年丰收，九亩地就打了十四石粮食；以后又经过减租清债，现在他已成为十二亩地，两头牛，一个骡的富裕中农了。他今年五亩谷地收了十五石谷子，二亩玉茭收了七石，其他的棉花和杂粮都比去年多收一倍。由于组织起来以后，上官中有整地垒堰，加了十个工，使揠土越过地面二寸，不仅未被雨水冲去田中肥料，而且更多储蓄了麦苗的水份，加以每亩地比往年多上了十担肥，并注意了苗根的培土和精耕细作，所以他的产量就特别高。他估计只是今年秋收的粮食，就足够全家吃两年半。
    【本报阳城二日电】俘山著名劳动英雄石振明在紧张的战争中领导群众突击秋收秋种，七天内完成四分之三，超过原定计划。石振明接到行署突击秋收秋种支援前线的紧急指示，立即于二十一日召集五村联合互助大队的动员会议，把所有半劳力（妇女、儿童、老汉）及小贩商人全部组织起来，突击尚未完成的秋收秋种，并抽出自卫队民兵三百人驰赴自卫战场。会议中原计划十天内种完七千亩麦子，二十天内收完九千余亩秋田。但由于大家的加倍努力，七天内即已完成了四分之三，每亩麦地皆犁了两遍，耙了四遍，上了七十担粪。
