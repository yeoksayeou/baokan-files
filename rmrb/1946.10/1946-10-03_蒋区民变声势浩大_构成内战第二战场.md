Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th -- According to incomplete statistics disclosed in newspapers, in recent months, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, unable to bear the oppression of tyranny, have risen up in rebellion one after another. People's uprisings have occurred in nine provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan. The areas of activity of the insurgents cover at least a hundred counties, with personnel and guns exceeding 200,000. The composition includes peasants as well as progressive officers and soldiers. The insurgent armed forces possess equipment such as rocket launchers, heavy artillery, light and heavy machine guns, and rifles, as well as at least a hundred ships. Chiang Kai-shek has mobilized the American-equipped 14th Army (in Sichuan), Tang Enbo's troops (in Jiangsu), and other regular troops and local forces, totaling hundreds of thousands of men, to attack the insurgent peasants. Consequently, in Chiang Kai-shek's own rear, a second battlefield of unprecedented large-scale civil war has been formed across the country. However, the people's armed forces are bravely resisting the "bandit suppression" Chiang's troops. In the battles in Sichuan and Jiangsu, they have forced entire batches of Chiang's troops to lay down their weapons more than ten times. At the same time, officers and soldiers of Chiang's army have revolted and joined the insurgent ranks. In Zhejiang's Yixing, Chongde, Pinghu, Songjiang, Wuxing, Changxing and other places alone, by August, more than ten groups of Chiang's soldiers had revolted. In Sichuan's Rongchang, Longchang, Dazu, and a certain county in western Sichuan, three companies and one platoon have successively revolted. In addition, after more than 200,000 Yi people in Sichuan and Xikang were massacred by Chiang's troops this spring, they still hold strong armed forces to resist Chiang's troops.

　　蒋区民变声势浩大
    构成内战第二战场
    【新华社延安三十日电】据报纸披露的不完全材料统计，数月来蒋区人民不堪暴政压迫，纷纷揭竿起义，发生民变者计有苏、浙、皖、湘、闽、粤、川、康、滇等九个省，变民活动地区至少达百余县，人枪在二十万以上，成份除农民以外并有进步官兵，民变武装拥有火箭炮、重炮、轻重机枪、步枪等装备，并有海船至少百余艘。蒋介石动员了美械第十四军（在四川），汤恩伯部队（在江苏）及其他正规军与地方团队共数十万人，对起义农民举行进攻。因而就在蒋介石自己的后方，构成了全国空前大规模内战的第二个战场。但人民武装英勇抗击进剿之蒋军，在四川与江苏之作战中，已有十余次迫使蒋军整批的放下武器。同时蒋军官兵纷纷起义，加入民变队伍，仅浙江之宜兴、崇德、平湖、松江、吴兴、长兴等地，至八月份止，蒋军起义者已达十余批。四川之荣昌、隆昌、大竹、川西某县先后亦有三个连及一个排起义，此外川康夷族自今春被蒋军屠杀二十余万人之后，现仍据有强大武装，抗击蒋军。
