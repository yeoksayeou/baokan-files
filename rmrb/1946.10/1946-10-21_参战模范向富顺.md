War Participation Model Xiang Fushun
    Wang Boying
    Xiang Fushun is a model militiaman from ××× Village, Huguan × District. He is a new type of person who has moved from the shackles of landlord life to a new democratic society. From his path of liberation to becoming wealthy through production, he deeply realized that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army were his only saviors. Last year, after the counter-offensive, when he heard that Yan Xishan, the "earth emperor" who had ravaged the people of Shanxi for more than twenty years, had repeatedly sent troops to attack the liberated areas and prevent the people from living free and happy lives, he was determined not to return home until the Yan army was driven back. He actively participated in the Shangdang self-defense war. Under the hail of bullets, his class love was even more pronounced. Wherever it was most dangerous, he went there to seize the color flags. Wherever the duty was heavy, his footprints were there. In the intense combat atmosphere of more than ten days, he always charged forward and retreated last, beating the Yan army that invaded the people to a frazzle. Finally, amidst the triumphant songs of victory, he returned to his lovely hometown.

    In June of this year, he participated in the armed work team supporting the new district of the border region. He climbed over the Taihang Mountains and arrived at Liejiangying Village in Xiuwu County, a vast plain. It is a small village with just over a hundred households, less than ten li from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet stronghold (Xiuwu City). In the past, under the long-term rule and oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek puppets, the villagers could hardly breathe. Fatalistic ideas shrouded the peasants' minds, and coupled with the deception of traitors and spies, and the threat of guns, the peasants' thinking was extremely chaotic. Xiang Leishun, who had turned the tables, saw the suffering lives of his class brothers and sisters, and with the determination to save them and organize them, decided to resolutely combat the harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek puppets. In the dark of night, he took the initiative to go deep into the vicinity of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet stronghold to scout and lay mines. During the day, in addition to guarding, he sought out the villagers to interview them about their suffering.

    June 10th was the happiest day in Xiang Fushun's life, and also the time he achieved the most in his work. From his own personal experience of hardship before his emancipation, he saw the suffering of a middle-aged woman. He began to patiently interview her:

    Xiang Fushun asked, "Old fellow villager! How much land do you cultivate? How many people are in your family? How much wheat have you planted? Let us help you harvest it!" At first, this poor middle-aged woman only said, "My family has three mu of land, two people, and I haven't planted a single grain of wheat." Xiang Fushun saw her concerns and continued, "Old fellow villager! I'll tell you the truth, six years ago, I was just as poor as you. Since the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came to our place and implemented rent and interest reduction and mutual aid in production, my poor times have turned into rich times. Now I don't worry about food or clothing. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, I would always be crushed under the big stone slab, oppressed by the rich and powerful. Today I came to your village because I want you to have the same good times as me. Look: the wheat ears are yellow, if you don't harvest them quickly, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the city will rob them, and you will starve. We are here to fight the Chiang Kai-shek puppets, and not let those bastards rob us of our lifeline—wheat—we want to help your village harvest the wheat, we don't want wages, and we don't eat your food, because all the poor people in the world are one family." After hearing Xiang Fushun's heartfelt words, it was like the sun after the clouds had cleared, and her mind suddenly became clear. Seeing that the clothes he was wearing were really those of an ordinary person, she pointed to the courtyard of the traitor landlord (who had fled) and said, "Oh! Fellow villager from Shanxi? When the people in that courtyard were there, they said, 'When the Eighth Route Army comes, no one will have a good time, they will start apportioning burdens, one stone per person, and take away the rest. They'll help harvest wheat, but for every stone harvested, they'll take eight dou, only leaving two dou. I'm a widow in my thirties, and they'll force me to find a man even if I don't want to.' Therefore, I was afraid when I saw you, but now I believe what you say. The Eighth Route Army always tells the truth. I was deceived by those bastards in the past (pointing to the traitor landlord's house with gnashed teeth), those bastards also oppressed me when they were at home. Fellow villager from Shanxi! The three mu of wheat I planted, I'll go to the field this afternoon to take a look, and if it's ripe, please help me harvest it." Xiang Fushun said with a smile, "We are one family, we will definitely help you harvest it."

    Under his propaganda, the villagers recognized that the militia supporting us were their own people, and they all came to Xiang Fushun to discuss the matter of harvesting wheat. Xiang Fushun and his comrades, in the midst of the battle, helped the masses of the whole village to harvest 905 mu of wheat, and threshed thirteen fields of wheat. The villagers were so happy that they kept saying, "The Eighth Route Army speaks the truth and doesn't deceive people, and they don't even eat when they help us harvest wheat, they are really a good team. If the Chiang Kai-shek troops come, not only will they not help us, but they will also beat and scold us, and rob us of our things."

    When Xiang Fushun and his comrades were about to leave the village, the villagers were unwilling to let them go. Until the very end, when they left, the villagers sent them to the entrance of the village as if they were sending off their own relatives. After they had gone far, the people returned to the village.

    When Xiang Fushun and his comrades arrived at a new village, some people were afraid that joining the militia would mean being drafted into the army, so they asked Xiang Fushun, "Aren't you afraid of being drafted into the army when you come here from the mountains?" Xiang Fushun guessed what they were thinking and said earnestly, "I joined the militia to protect the people and our interests. We came here to help work voluntarily. You have to know that the militia is a home-guarding force that does not detach from production. You will know that we will not be drafted into the army. We come to your village to fight the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and we also exchange labor with the mutual aid team at home. For every day we stay here, our village will credit one work point. My work is completely done by the mutual aid team. This is a combination of combat, production, and great labor exchange." After hearing his words, the village militiamen knew that the militia was a home-guarding force and would not be drafted into the army, so they worked with great enthusiasm. They united with Xiang Fushun's support team and launched a strong self-defense struggle.

    In short, Xiang Fushun could form a solid bond with the masses of any village he went to. The main thing is that he can understand the people's minds, individually interview people about their suffering, and educate the masses with the facts of his own liberation. More importantly, he has a spirit of class love and loyalty to serving the masses.

    At the end of August, after he completed his task, he returned from outside. At the "September 2nd" Victory Day, at the county-wide militia self-defense team review meeting, Xiang Fushun was honorably selected by thousands of militia self-defense teams as the county's first-class war participation model.

　　参战模范向富顺
    王伯英
    向富顺是壶关×区×××村的模范民兵。他是从地主的枷锁生活中，走向了新民主主义社会的新型人物。他从翻身到生产发家的坦途中，深刻的体会到共产党、八路军是他唯一的救命恩人。去年反攻后，他一听到蹂躏山西人民二十多年的土皇帝——阎锡山连派大兵来进攻解放区，不让老百姓过自由幸福的生活，就抱定不打退阎军誓不回家的决心，积极的参加了上党自卫战。在枪林弹雨下，他那阶级的热爱，表现的更加显著。那里最危险，他就到那里抢救彩号，那里勤务繁重，那里就有他的足迹，在十多天剧烈的战斗氛围中，他总是冲锋在前，退却在后，把进犯人民的阎军打得焦头烂额。终于在胜利的凯歌中，回到他可爱的故乡。
    今年六月里，他参加了支援边区新区的武工队。爬过了太行山，到达了广阔平原修武县的列江营村。它是距蒋伪据点（修武城）不到十里只一百多人家的一个小村。过去在蒋伪长期的统治压榨下，村里的人们气也喘不过来，命运的思想笼罩了农民的脑子，加以奸霸特务的欺骗，黑枪威胁，农民们思想极其混乱。翻透身的向雷顺看到阶级兄弟姊妹们的痛苦生活后，就抱着拯救他们，把他们也组织起来的决心，决定坚决打击蒋伪的袭扰，黑夜里主动的深到蒋伪据点附近侦察埋雷，白日里除警戒外，就找老乡们访谈他们的痛苦。
    六月十日是向富顺有生以来最愉快的一天，也是他工作收获最有成绩的一次。他从自己未翻身前那苦境的亲身体验中，看出了一个中年妇人的苦难心情，他开始耐心的慢慢的进行她的访问：
    向富顺问：“老乡！你种有多少地？家有几口人？种的多少麦子？我们帮你割吧！”起初这位贫苦的中年妇人只说：“我家有三亩地，人两口，一粒麦子也没种。”向富顺看出了她的顾虑，接着说：“老乡！我实实在在的告诉你，六年前，我也是和你一样的贫穷，自共产党、八路军到了俺那里实行了减租减息，生产互助后，我的穷时光就变成了富时光。现在不愁吃，也不愁穿。要不是共产党、八路军来的话，俺永远压在大石板底下，受人家有钱有势的人的欺压，今天俺来你村，就是想叫你们也过着和俺一样的好时光，你看：麦穗黄了，如不快收叫城里的蒋伪军抢走，就得饿肚子。俺们就是来打蒋伪，不让狗日的抢走咱们的命根儿——麦子——我们要帮助你村收割麦子，也不要工钱，也不吃你们的饭，因为天下的穷人都是一家人。”她听了向富顺这段真心话，好像云散后的太阳，脑子一下就清亮了。又看他穿的衣服，实在就是个老百姓，就一边指着奸霸地主（已跑了）的院子，一边说：嗳哟！山西老乡？那院里的人在时说：‘八路军来了谁也不得好过，起负担，一人留一石，下余的都拿走。帮助收麦，收一石，要八斗，只给留二斗，俺这三十多岁的寡妇，不愿找男人也要强迫给找个男人。因此俺一见你们就害怕，现在俺可相信你的话了。八路军说的都是老实话。俺过去受了狗日的（切齿的指着奸霸地主家）骗，狗日的在家时也欺压俺。山西老乡！我种的三亩麦子，下午俺到地里去看看，如熟了，就请你们帮俺割割。”向富顺笑迷迷的说：“咱是一家人，一定帮你割。”
    全村的老乡，在他的宣传下，对我支援的民兵，认认了是自己人，都来找向富顺，商量割麦的事，向富顺就和他的伙伴们，在战斗的氛围中，帮助全村群众抢收了九○五亩麦子，并打了十三场麦子。老乡们高兴的不住嘴说：“八路军说话不欺人，帮助收麦连饭也不吃，真是好队伍。要是蒋军来了，不但不助帮，还要打骂咱们，抢夺咱们的东西。”
    向富顺和他的伙伴们将要离开该村时，村里的老乡们都不愿叫走，直到最后离开的时候，老乡们像送自己的亲人似的把他们送出村口，待他们走远了，人们才回村去。
    向富顺和他的伙伴们新到了一个村，村里有人怕当民兵要编队伍，便问向富顺：“你们从山上来这里，就不怕编了队伍？”向富顺猜透了他们的心思，就苦口婆心的说：“俺参加民兵是为了保护老百姓和俺的利益。俺们来这里帮助工作，都是自愿来的。要晓得民兵是不脱离生产的保家队，就知道不会编队伍了，俺来你村打蒋伪军，还与家里的互助组变工，在这里住一天，俺村里就给顶一个工，俺的活完全由互助组来做，这是个战斗生产大变工的结合。”该村民兵听了他的话后，晓得民兵是保家队，不会编队伍，所以干得劲头大起来，他们和向富顺的支援队团结在一起，展开了强有力的自卫斗争。
    总之，向富顺到了那个村，就能和那个村的群众结成一个疙瘩。主要的是他能摸透群众的心思，以个别访问痛苦，拿自己的翻身事实教育群众。更重要的是他那阶级的热爱与忠心为群众服务的精神。
    八月底他完成任务后，从外边回来了。在“九二”胜利节，全县民兵自卫队检阅大会上，向富顺光荣的被数千民兵自卫队选为全县的一等参战模范。
