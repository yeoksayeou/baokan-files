　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, dated 11th] The Taihang Administrative Office recently issued an important directive, calling for the launch of a large-scale winter production movement in urban and rural areas. It pointed out that winter is a very good season for production, and small cooperatives are the best organizational form for winter production. This winter, a large-scale winter production movement exceeding any previous year should be launched. Its significant meaning lies in: (1) The old liberated areas have basically realized "land to the tiller," and the masses are further demanding production for wealth. (2) Some areas suffered from wind and frost disasters in the autumn, and this loss needs to be compensated for through winter production. (3) It is necessary to support the front lines in winning the patriotic self-defense war. The directive further stated that organizing the entire region is the guiding principle for winter production. At the same time, attention should be paid to engaging in more long-term production to lay a solid foundation for industry and commerce. The focus is on developing the transportation industry, the textile industry, various handicrafts, workshops, and household sideline occupations. Each county should repair roads, open up cart roads, improve transportation tools, develop livestock, organize winter transportation depots, improve textile tools, and improve textile technology. Textile blank areas should immediately implement a self-sufficiency policy and consciously cultivate and develop fixed handicraft workshops. Cities should also widely organize citizen production and launch urban small cooperative movements. At present, attention should be paid to overcoming the masses' winter idleness mentality and the wasteful phenomenon of farmers in newly liberated areas after they have turned over. The perception of winter production as a "production pastime" and "picking up scraps" should also be corrected. In order to stimulate winter production, loans should be issued in advance, and loans, the fruits of mass movement struggles, and the masses' floating capital should be combined into a great economic force to support the development of small cooperatives and launch this year's large-scale winter production movement.

　　太行行署号召全区城乡
    开展大规模冬季生产
    积极生产补偿秋霜损失发展运输纺织生财致富
    【本报长治十一日电】太行行署顷发出重要指示，号召开展大规模城乡冬季生产运动。指出：冬季是很好的生产季节。小型合作社是冬季生产的最好组织形式。今年冬季应开展一个超过以往任何一年的大规模冬季生产运动。其重大的意义在于：（一）老区基本上实现了“耕者有其田”，群众进一步要求生产致富。（二）入秋部分地区遭受风灾霜灾，这一损失要求在冬季生产中补偿。（三）为支援前线争取爱国自卫战争胜利所必需。继指出：全区组织起来是冬季生产的方针。同时要注意多从事长期性的生产，为工商业打下稳固的基础。重点为发展运输业、纺织业、各种手工业、作坊与家庭副业。各县应修整道路，开辟大车路，改良运输工具，发展牲畜，组织冬季运输货栈，改良纺织工具，与提高纺织技术。纺织空白区应即贯彻自给自足方针，并有意识的培养与发展定型的手工业作坊。各城市亦应广泛组织市民生产，开展城市小型合作社运动。目前应即注意克服群众冬闲思想，与新区农民翻身后的浪费现象。并纠正把冬季生产当成“生产余兴”及“捎带拾砍”的认识。为了刺激冬季生产，贷款应即提前发放，将贷款、群运斗争果实与群众游资汇成一支伟大的经济力量，扶植发展小型合作社，开展今年的冬季大生产运动。
