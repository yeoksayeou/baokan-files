    A Certain American in Shanghai Points Out
    America's Reactionary Policy Towards China
    Aims for Complete Domination
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] Shanghai News: Wenhui Bao held a symposium on "U.S. Troops Withdraw from China" on September 20th. People from all walks of life in Shanghai were invited to participate and speak enthusiastically. Writer Tian Han spoke first, pointing out that the U.S. government's "mediator" had made China even worse than it was before. Later, he said indignantly, "As a Chinese, we have no reason to let a 'mediator' with prejudices continue like this." An international friend who did not want to reveal his name said that he completely disagreed with the current U.S. policy toward China. The United States is unwilling for China to obtain peace and democracy immediately. What they want is the one-party dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek, so that this dictatorial regime is completely dependent on the United States financially and militarily, so that the United States actually completely dominates China, and is attempting to make China their anti-Soviet alliance. He stated: "I know for sure that at several cocktail parties in Nanjing, the highest U.S. military personnel and Chinese Kuomintang military leaders clinked glasses for the future joint war against the Soviet Union. He advocated that democratic countries in the United Nations should advise the United States not to continue stationing troops in China and interfering in China's internal affairs. If mediation fails, the case should be submitted to the United Nations Security Council. At the meeting, entrepreneurs Zhang Wenbo, women's leader Xu Guangping, entrepreneur Ms. Hu Ziying, Professor Ma Xulun and others also spoke. In addition to exposing the U.S. government's militaristic diplomatic line and colonial policy toward China, they unanimously called on the Chinese and American people to unite and stop this wrong behavior of the U.S. government.

    美国对华反动政策
    企图完全统治中国
    【新华社延安六日电】沪讯：文汇报曾于九月二十日举行“美军退出中国”座谈会，沪各界人士均被邀参加热烈发言。作家田汉首先发言，他指出美国政府“调人”已把中国蒙得比原来的样子还坏。后来他愤懑的说：“我们做为一个中国人是没有理由任一个有成见有偏见的“调人”老是这样继续下去的。”一位不愿宣布姓名的国际友人说，他对美国当前的对华政策是完全不能同意的，美国不愿中国立刻获得和平民主，他们所要的是蒋介石一党专政的统一，使这个独裁政权在财政上及军事上完全依赖美国，使美国在实际上完全统治中国，并正企图使中国成为他们的反苏同盟。他声称：“我确切知道在南京若干鸡尾酒会上，美国最高军事人员曾和中国国民党的军事领袖，为将来共同向苏联作战而碰杯。他主张联合国中的民主国家，应忠告美国勿再继续驻军中国，干涉中国内政，如调解不果，应把这案件提交联合国安全理事会。会上尚有实业家张文伯、妇女界领袖许广平、实业家胡子婴女士、马叙伦教授等人发言，除揭露美国政府军国主义的外交路线及对华殖民地政策外，一致号召中美人民联合行动起来，停止美国政府此一错误行为。
