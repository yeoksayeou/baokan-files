Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 7th. Mr. Cheng Xuzai, a renowned educator from Chahar Province, recently wrote to the Xuanhua Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, requesting to join the Party, which has been approved by the Municipal Committee. Old Mr. Cheng was a "lin sheng" (government-subsidized student) during the Qing Dynasty and later graduated from Beiyang Normal University in the early Republic of China period. Afterwards, he silently dedicated himself to the cause of popularizing education for more than twenty years. His students are all over the place, and people from all walks of life in Chahar Province admire him for his hard work in promoting education for the masses. This spring, during the election of representatives to the National Assembly from Chahar Province, he was elected as a representative from Xuanhua City. With his rich experience through the eras of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, he firmly believes in the complete correctness of the New Democratic Revolution being carried out by the Chinese Communist Party today. Before joining the Party, he said that requesting to join the Party at a time when the reactionaries of Chiang Kai-shek are attacking his hometown is to express his firm confidence in victory and his determination to dedicate his remaining years to the people.

    【新华社宣化七日电】察省六十五岁高龄著名教育家程煦载老先生，最近投书中共宣化市委会，请求入党，已为市委批准。程老出身前清廪生，民初复毕业于北洋师范大学，之后默默献身普及教育事业。凡二十余年，桃李遍各地，察省各阶层人士多钦以其为人民大众刻苦兴学。今春察省国大代表选举，曾被选为宣市代表。彼以经历满清，北洋军阀，与蒋介石独裁各时代，丰富的阅历，坚信中共今日所实行的新民主主义革命事业的完全正确。彼入党前曾谓，适于反动派蒋介石进攻家乡之际请求入党，盖所以表示余此种坚定的胜利信心，并不惜为人民大众捐出残躯之决心。
