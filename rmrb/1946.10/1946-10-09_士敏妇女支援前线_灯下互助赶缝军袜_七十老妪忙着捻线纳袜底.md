　　Shimin Women Support the Front Lines
    Lamps Lit for Mutual Aid to Stitch Military Socks
    Seventy-Year-Old Woman Busily Twisting Thread and Sewing Sock Bottoms
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 5th dispatch] Three thousand women in Shimin are actively sewing winter socks for the soldiers on the front lines. Eight thousand pairs of military socks have now been shipped to the Tongpu front lines. They were encouraged by the brilliant victory of the Tongpu Central Section Self-Defense War, and all said, "The weather is getting cold, quickly sew winter clothes and winter socks for the soldiers on the front lines! Guarantee they don't freeze so they can win more battles." More than 3,500 women in the Third and Fourth Districts are competing to help each other sew military socks under the lamps. A seventy-year-old woman in Shijia Village is also busy twisting thread to sew sock bottoms and sock welts. Jia Miandi, the leader of the Shili Village group, said, "Our troops are fighting every day on the front lines to protect us. The weather is cold, so let's quickly make shoes and socks for them!" Wang Langrong and six other female students from Liugou School took time out from their studies to sew eight pairs of socks. He Doubiao, a student from No. 2 High School, ran ten miles to carry military sock cloth. Within five days, all eight thousand pairs of military socks were completed.
