[This Dispatch from Our Frontline in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region on the 8th] The Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 11th Division and 5th Army, which advanced on Juye from Heze and Dingtao, have begun to waver and retreat under the fierce counterattack of our army, and their formation is in disarray. Our heroic soldiers completely annihilated one company and its machine gun platoon of the 11th Brigade of the 11th Division on the night of the 3rd. On the evening of the 5th, they stormed Zhangfengji, south of Caojiazhai, which was occupied by the 11th Brigade headquarters and its 32nd Regiment of the Chiang army and fierce fighting is underway. The Chiang army gathered in Zhangfengji, East and West Jiangzhuang, and Xiao Family Village fled in panic to the southwest area of Hongshawuo, Wangjiazhai, and Liu Family Village and are now surrounded by us. The Chiang’s 5th Army, which invaded Lugai and Wenlou along the Heze-Juye highway via Shatuji, suffered heavy casualties and has been forced to retreat, and Wenlou and Lugai have been successively recovered by us. Since the 5th, the Chiang army has concentrated tremendous firepower and four American-made aircraft to launch fierce attacks on Long＠ji on the Heze-Juye highway, but all have failed. Long＠ji is still firmly in our hands. The 11th Division and the 5th Army are about to repeat the fate of the 3rd Reorganized Division and be annihilated.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线八日电】自荷泽定陶分路向我巨野进犯之蒋军第十一师与第五军，在我军猛烈反击下，已开始动摇后退，阵脚已乱。我英勇健儿于三日夜全歼十一师第十一旅一个连及其机枪排后，又于五日晚，攻入曹家垓以南蒋军十一旅旅部及其卅二团盘据之张凤集，刻正在激战中。集结于张凤集，东西蒋庄、萧家庄之蒋军仓惶向西南红沙窝、王家垓、刘家庄一带逃窜，现亦陷我包围中。沿荷（泽）巨（野）公路，侵占沙土集向路垓、文楼进犯之蒋第五军，遭到惨重伤亡后，已被迫向后撤退，文楼、路垓已先后为我收复。五日以来蒋军对荷（泽）巨（野）公路上之龙＠集，曾集中绝大火力及美式飞机机四架配合猛攻，均未得逞，龙＠集仍在我手中，屹然不动。十一师与第五军即将重蹈整三师的覆辙而被歼。
