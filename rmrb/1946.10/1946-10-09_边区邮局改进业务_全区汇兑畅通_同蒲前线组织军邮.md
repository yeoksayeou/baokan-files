　　Border Region Post Office Improves Services
    Exchange Services Unblocked Throughout the Region
    Tongpu Front Organizes Military Post
    [This newspaper's Handan, 8th dispatch] The Border Region Post Office has recently been actively rectifying its organization and improving its services. It stipulates that the central work from October to December is to overcome disorder and improve technology, using work-day achievements to support the front lines. Recently, it has cooperated with Yutong Transportation Company to open automobile postal routes from Handan to Wu'an and Handan to Xingtai, enabling Handan and Xingtai to see newspapers on the same morning; the speed of transporting books, journals, parcels, and other mail will also be improved. Moreover, starting from October, exchange services will be unified throughout the region, and all will use postal money order methods, abolishing the remittance system. Each money order will be a minimum of ten yuan and a maximum of fifty thousand yuan, with postage stamps designated separately. This postal route has reached more than 1,620 li to counties and cities such as Wei County, Linqing, Puyang, Heze, and Jining. In addition, it is planning to invite postal administrations from various liberated areas to discuss joint postal procedures for exchange and parcel delivery. In order to ensure that propaganda materials are delivered to the front lines and to ensure that the front lines have newspapers to read, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has specifically proposed: "Good cadres should go to the front lines to organize military post offices," and "Strengthening the main lines means supporting the front lines." Originally scheduled to form military post offices within three days, they were organized in two days, with more than 50 people running back and forth under artillery fire and Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing and strafing, picking up and delivering documents and newspapers, often traveling about 100 li a day. Everyone is extremely enthusiastic, unanimously striving to be models of military postal work, "We will never return to the rear until we crush Chiang's army's offensive." The Taiyue region's Tongpu Front has now formed this military post office and started working. (Su Tang)

　　边区邮局改进业务
    全区汇兑畅通
    同蒲前线组织军邮
    【本报邯郸八日讯】边区邮政局近来积极整顿组织改进业务，规定十月至十二月份中心工作是克服紊乱现象，提高技术，以工日成绩支援前线。最近已与裕通转运公司合作，开辟邯郸至武安，邯郸至邢台之汽车邮线使邯郸和邢台均可在当天上午看到报纸；书志包裹等邮件运送速度亦将提高。并且自十月份起，全区一律通汇，亦皆改用票汇办法，废除解款制度，每张汇票最少十元，最多五万元，另外指定邮票。此项邮线已达威县、临清、濮阳、荷泽、济宁等县市一千六百二十余里。此外则正拟邀约各解放区邮管局，商讨通汇通包之联邮手续，为了保证把宣传材料送到前方去，保证前方有报纸看，冀鲁豫区更具体提出：“好干部到前线去组织随军邮局”，“加强干线就是支援前方”等。原定三天内组成随军邮局，结果在两天内即组织起来，共有五十余人，往返奔驰于炮火及蒋机轰炸扫射之下，取送文件、报纸，常一日走百里左右。大家情绪极高，一致要争取做随军邮政工作之模范，“不粉碎蒋军进攻，绝不回后方来”。现太岳区同蒲前线已组成此项随军邮局，开始工作。（苏塘）
