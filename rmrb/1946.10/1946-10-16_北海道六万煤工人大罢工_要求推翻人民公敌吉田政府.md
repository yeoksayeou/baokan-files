　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: The large-scale strike called by the Hokkaido branch of the Japan Coal Miners' Union erupted on the night of the 10th. Forty-three of the forty-six miners' unions in Hokkaido have joined the strike, with 60,000 workers walking out of the mines. On the same day, the Tokyo headquarters of the All-Japan Coal Miners' Union ordered its Kyushu branches to conduct a 24-hour strike. The branches in Kyushu have pledged their full support to the Hokkaido miners, vowing to stage a general strike and fight together to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet, the public enemy of Japanese workers. Twenty to thirty Kyushu coal mines had already ceased operations by the 10th. It is understood that when the general strike simultaneously launched by other industrial unions across the country breaks out, all Japanese miners will immediately enter a general strike. The All-Japan Electrical Workers' Union, which controls power plants in the Kanto region, is currently preparing to strike on the 15th. The All-Japan Machinery Workers' Union in the Kanto region, with 100,000 members, plans to present a final demand to the Yoshida cabinet, and if rejected, will hold a strike on the 16th. It is expected that the All-Japan Chemical Workers' Union, with 65,000 members, will strike around the 14th. Regarding the miners' strike that started first, Tokyo sources say that if the 80,000 workers of the Kyushu Coal Miners' Union also participate in the Hokkaido miners' general strike, all Japanese transportation relying on non-electric power will be paralyzed, and the Japanese industrial economy may be on the verge of complete paralysis. At present, Japan's coal production is already very low, far from the minimum target of 2 million tons per month.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Tokyo dispatch: The Radio Workers' Union continues its five-day strike. The socialists' democracy is also responding, and now newspapers are also ceasing publication. Some editors and workers of the Mainichi Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun are also holding national conditions strikes.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: United Press, Tokyo dispatch: A spokesman for the National Federation of Industrial Organizations, a nationwide Japanese workers' organization, told a United Press reporter on the 10th that several large trade unions participating in the federation plan to call for a series of large-scale strikes starting on October 15th.
