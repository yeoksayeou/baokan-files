[This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Changzhi, 19th] The people of Wu'an have launched a movement to eliminate traitors and oppose special agents, and many Chiang Kai-shek special agents who were lurking in urban and rural areas and attempting to create disturbances have been arrested. Since last month, the situation in northern Henan has been tense, and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents took the opportunity to make trouble. On the night of September 10th, special agents gathered dozens of people and suddenly surrounded our Tenth District Office in the middle of the night, shouting and yelling, but they were dispersed by our gunfire, and two people were captured. On the 25th, in Beifengchang, an incident occurred where special agents snatched guns from the militia and beat up the militia captain. They were dispersed by the surrounding village militia, and several key members were captured. On the same night, at the Fourth District Office, special agents shouted "Charge!" outside the village. At the beginning of the month, an incident occurred in the Fourth District where special agents attempted to seize the guns of the District Office, and the main culprit was captured on the spot. After preliminary interrogation, it was revealed that these hidden special agents had been plotting a riot for a long time, intending to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive in northern Henan and launch a major riot on September 19th. However, due to the unity of the military and civilians in our liberated areas, they had no opportunity to exploit. Recently, it has also been discovered that special agents in various places are using superstition and spreading terror, throwing stones and acting like ghosts at night. The military and civilians throughout the county are extremely angry at such actions by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. They have now strengthened martial law and launched a mass movement to prevent special agents and eliminate traitors, resolutely not allowing them to disrupt the rear.

　　蒋记特务阴谋暴动未遂
    主要分子大部就逮
    武安群众注意除奸防特
    【本报长治十九日电】武安人民掀起除奸反特运动，潜伏城乡，企图捣乱之蒋特分子多已被捕。上月以来，豫北形势紧张，蒋特分子即乘机捣乱，于九月十日夜间，特务纠集数十人，突于深夜包围我十区公所，呐喊，被我开枪击散，当捕获二人。二十五日，北冯昌发生特务抢夺民兵枪支，并吊打民兵队长事件，被周围村庄民兵击散，捕获首要分子数人。同日夜，四区公所，发生特务在村外呐喊“冲叹”。月初，四区又发生特务企图夺取区公所枪支事件，主犯当场亦被捕获，经初步审讯，此等潜藏特务分子，阴谋暴动已久，彼等企图配合蒋军在豫北进攻，于九月十九日大暴动。但终因我解放区军民团结无机可乘。最近又发现各地特务，利用迷信、散布恐怖，于晚间抛掷石块，装鬼弄怪现象。全县军民，对蒋特此种举动，愤恨已极，现已加强戒严，掀起群众性的防特除奸运动，决不容其捣乱后方秩序。
