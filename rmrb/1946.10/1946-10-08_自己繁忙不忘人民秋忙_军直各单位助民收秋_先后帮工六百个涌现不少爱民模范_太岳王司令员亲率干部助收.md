　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan] The military units directly under the command, amidst their busy work, have been helping the masses with the autumn harvest. In late September, they assisted with labor in 606 instances, harvesting 514.5 mu of millet, threshing 523 bundles of millet stalks, hoeing 84 mu of millet stubble fields, cutting 48 mu of sorghum, and picking 144 mu of cotton. The Third Bureau's newly purchased mule was lent to the villagers free of charge, even suspending its own transportation duties. In the assistance effort, many models of cherishing the people emerged. Many comrades, despite having blisters on their hands, did not rest. Zhang Hai from the Garrison Headquarters, even with scabies, participated. Zhao Tiancai, from the Second Company of the Guard Regiment, chopped grass for his landlord, severing two sections of his finger, and said, "We are the people's soldiers, helping the masses should be like helping our own parents." Before his injury had healed, he was already cutting millet for the villagers again. The comrades strictly abided by the instructions from higher authorities, not smoking a single cigarette or eating a single meal from the villagers, even bringing their own boiled water. The villager Wei Shoutang said to the comrades with a smile, "I don't need you anymore! You are harvesting crops for me, but you don't eat when it's mealtime, and you don't smoke a single cigarette. Please go back!" The comrades quickly explained, "Don't think that just because we are working for you we don't eat your food or smoke your cigarettes. Look at what we wear and eat, isn't it all supplied by you, the common people?" Only then did Old Wei change his tone and say, "You are really good, really good!"
