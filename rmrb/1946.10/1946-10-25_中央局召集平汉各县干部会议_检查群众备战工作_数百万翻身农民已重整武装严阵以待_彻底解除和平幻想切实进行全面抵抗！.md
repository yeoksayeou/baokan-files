[Reported by this newspaper from Handan on the 23rd] In order to make cadres and the masses thoroughly eliminate illusions of peace, resolutely carry out comprehensive resistance guerrilla self-defense warfare, and arrange a burial tomb for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau specially convened a cadre meeting on the 16th of county committee secretaries and armed committees directors from Handan, Ci and other counties along the Pinghan Railway to inspect the war preparation work of the masses along the line. The meeting lasted for four days. During the discussion, everyone was filled with confidence in victory. The implementation of "Land to the Tiller" has made the sentiment of millions of peasants along the line to defend their homes and themselves even higher than during the Anti-Japanese War. The peasants of Ci County, who have already obtained land, are using both foreign guns and indigenous guns, and men, women, old and young are all demanding to arm themselves. In areas of the county frequently harassed by Chiang's secret agents, strong militia joint defense has been organized. The county has now organized × militia companies and × backbone teams, and is actively organizing a county brigade. These mass armed forces all have a unified headquarters. In the past ten days or so, they have successively repelled sixteen attacks by reactionary secret agent armed forces; there were ten large-scale battles, powerfully defeating Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent "Homecoming Corps." The masses in the rear have extensively and deeply launched anti-secret agent movements to support the anti-stubborn struggles of the armed forces in the border areas; the front and the rear are completely united. Therefore, the secretary of the Ci County Party Committee said with great confidence: If the reactionaries dare to attack us, then with just one call, all 350,000 people in the county can be mobilized in two days. The war preparation report of the director of the Wu'an Armed Committee was full of hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. He said: The command structure of the whole county during the Anti-Japanese War has long been restored; more than 10,000 militiamen have completed combat preparations; tens of thousands of iron and stone landmines are being prepared for that group of reactionaries. More than 200 villages have organized rescue teams and stretcher teams, and they are ready to go out at any time to meet the invaders. Some of the militiamen have also supported the Anyang front. In the Cheng (An) Ci (County) area, the liberated masses are dividing the whole county into various combat areas according to the needs of the self-defense war, and the militia have formed elite guerrilla groups and armed work teams; the leading cadres are also determined to fight the reactionaries to the end in order to protect the interests of the masses and help the masses to thoroughly liberate themselves. In the Linzhang area, the liberated masses are disarming the reactionary landlords and secret agents to arm themselves; more than 100 villages have organized militias. In other counties such as Handan, the enthusiasm of the masses for self-defense armed forces is rising day by day. Even so, the counties are still not satisfied. On the basis of what they already have, they further discussed: How to unite the masses, arm the masses, and launch a tenacious self-defense guerrilla war? How to carry out war preparations on the basis of thoroughly implementing "Land to the Tiller"? And how to continue the mass movement against traitors and against special agents and other specific methods.

　　中央局召集平汉各县干部会议
    检查群众备战工作
    数百万翻身农民已重整武装严阵以待
    彻底解除和平幻想切实进行全面抵抗！
    【本报邯郸二十三日讯】为使干部群众彻底解除和平幻想，切实进行全面抵抗的游击自卫战争，给蒋介石反动派安排葬身的坟墓，晋冀鲁豫中央局特于十六日召集平汉线邯磁等县县委书记、武委会主任等干部会议，检查沿线群众备战工作。会议共进行了四天，在讨论中大家充满着胜利的信心。耕者有其田的实行，已使沿线数百万农民保家自卫的情绪，比抗日战争时期更为高涨。已经获得土地的磁县农民，他们把洋枪土枪都一齐使用起来，男女老少都一齐要求武装自己。该县蒋记特务经常袭扰的地区，强大的民兵联防已组织起来。全县现已组织起×个民兵连，×个基干队，并正积极组织县大队。这些群众武装，都有统一的指挥部。十多天来，他们曾先后打退反动派特务武装十六次的进攻；较大规模的作战共十次，有力的打垮了蒋介石的特务“还乡团”。后方的群众已广泛深入的展开反特务运动，以支援边地武装的反顽斗争；前线和后方完全团结在一起。因之，磁县县委书记很有信心的说：假如反动派敢于向我们进攻，那么只要一声号召，全县三十五万群众，两天即可动员起来。武安武委会主任的备战报告，充满着对蒋介石反动派的仇恨。他说：全县抗日战争时的指挥机构，已早恢复起来；一万多个民兵，已完成了战斗准备；数万颗铁石地雷，正为那批反动派准备着。二百多个村庄组织起救护队与担架队，他们随时准备出动迎击进犯者。有一部分民兵，并已支援安阳前线。在成（安）磁（县）地区，翻身的群众，正按自卫战争的需要，全县划分了各种作战地区，民兵已组成精干的游击集团和武工队；领导的干部们，也决心为保护群众利益，帮助群众彻底翻身，而与反动派斗争到底。在临漳地区，翻身的群众，正把解除反动地主与特务的武装武装着自己；一百多个村庄，组织起民兵。其他如邯郸等县，群众自卫武装的热情，正逐日高涨。虽然如此，但各县仍未感到满足，他们在已有的基础上，更进一步的讨论了：如何团结群众，武装群众，与展开顽强的自卫游击战争？如何在彻底贯彻耕者有其田的基础上去进行备战？以及如何继续反奸防特的群众运动等具体办法。
