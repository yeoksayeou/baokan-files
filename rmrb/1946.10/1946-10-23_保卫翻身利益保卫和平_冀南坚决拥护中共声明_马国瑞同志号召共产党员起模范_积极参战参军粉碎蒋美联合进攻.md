[This Dispatch from Weixian, 20th] Chiang Kai-shek declared a full-scale split. The CCP Central Committee issued a statement to the whole country on the 17th regarding the current situation, which has been unanimously supported by all the people of southern Hebei. Director Meng Futang of the Administrative Office powerfully said: "Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of Zhangjiakou demonstrates his determination to split completely. The CCP Central Committee's statement is in line with the people's expectations." He said sadly: "After the armistice agreement in January this year, the people of southern Hebei enthusiastically celebrated and earnestly implemented the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, devoting themselves to peaceful construction. For example, more than 1,400 li of roads were built, all rivers were repaired, the Fu and Wei rivers were opened to navigation, 210 million yuan was loaned to support production, urban industry and commerce developed rapidly, more than 9,000 primary schools were established, with more than 620,000 children enrolled, and rent reduction and interest rate reduction were thoroughly implemented, moving towards 'land to the tiller'. Chiang Kai-shek, under the direction of his American masters, launched a full-scale civil war, destroying the peaceful and happy life of the people of southern Hebei. Now, all the people are burning with anger to defend peace, defend democracy, and defend the motherland. The Chiang-American reactionaries will ultimately fail." Comrade Ma Guorui of the CCP Southern Hebei District Committee said: "We resolutely support the CCP Central Committee's timely statement. All Party members in our Southern Hebei District should lead the broad masses of farmers with exemplary actions to thoroughly realize 'land to the tiller'. Actively participate in the army and the war to crush the joint US-Chiang Kai-shek offensive." Deputy Commander Wang of the military region said: "After the January armistice order, the Chiang bandits commanded the puppet troops in Yongnian, Liaocheng, Gaotang, Dezhou, Yucheng and other places to violate the agreement and invade the southern Hebei liberated area hundreds of times, looting, burning, killing and harming the people everywhere. Now they are determined to split completely. Our sons and daughters of the people of southern Hebei pledge to defend the motherland and the interests of the people of southern Hebei, and annihilate the US-Chiang invaders as we resisted the Japanese invaders." Director Xi of the National Salvation General Association said: The eight million farmers in southern Hebei who have been liberated must fight to the end to defend their fruits of liberation. The 200,000 militiamen under the leadership of the Southern Hebei Military Commission will all become guerrilla corps until the attacking Chiang army is completely wiped out." Shi Decai, a distinguished labor hero of Weixian County, said angrily: "That old Chiang has occupied our Zhangjiakou, and then he talks about peace. Who still believes his stuff? We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao."

    【本报威县二十日电】蒋介石宣告全面破裂，十七日中共中央向全国发出对目前时局的声明，获得冀南全体人民一致拥护。行署孟夫唐主任有力的说：“蒋介石侵占张垣，决心全面破裂，中共中央这个声明正符民望。”他沉痛的说：“今年一月停战协定后，冀南人民曾狂热庆祝，并切实执行政协决议，致力和平建设。如修筑公路千四百余里，河流全部修治，滏、卫两河通航，贷款两万万一千万元扶持生产，城市工商业飞跃发展，初小已达九千余处，入学儿童达六十二万余人，彻底实行了减租减息，走向“耕者有其田”，蒋介石在其美国主子指使下，发动全面内战，破坏了冀南人民和平幸福生活。现在，全体人民已燃烧着保卫和平、保卫民主、保卫祖国的怒火，蒋美反动派最后必归失败。”中共冀南区党委马国瑞同志说：“我们坚决拥护中共中央局这个切合时宜的声明，我冀南区全体党员应以模范行动领导广大农民，彻底实现‘耕者有其田’。积极参军、参战，粉碎美蒋联合进攻。”军区王副司令谈：“一月停战令后，蒋贼指挥永年、聊城、高唐、德州、禹城等地伪军，违约进犯冀南解放区达数百次，到处抢掠烧杀残害人民，至今更决心全面破裂，我冀南人民子弟兵誓当保卫祖国，保卫冀南人民利益，像抗击日寇一样，消灭美蒋进犯者。”救国总会习主任谈称：冀南已经翻身的八百万农民一定要为保卫自己的翻身果实奋斗到底。在冀南武委总会领导下的二十万民兵，都将变为游击兵团，直至把进攻的蒋军完全消灭。”威县出色劳动英雄石得才气愤的说：“老蒋这小子占了咱张家口，又说讲和，谁还信他那一套，咱们坚决跟着毛主席走。”
