　　More Than a Thousand Activists in the Xin District of Qin County
    Hold a Meeting to Exchange Mass Experience
    [Our newspaper Yangcheng News] The movement of speaking bitterness and revenge in the new district of Qin County is developing vigorously, and more than a thousand activists who have turned over have emerged in the two months of struggle. In early October, each base village held an activist meeting to exchange experiences and call on the masses in the county to learn from the activists, learn their methods of turning over, and strive for a vigorous and universal development of the movement in the whole county. Zhang Maohai of Nanchen Village has a good sense of collectivism and a spirit of working for everyone. He advocated in the movement: "Everyone should turn over, and every farmer should have land to cultivate and clothes to wear." When distributing fruits, he especially took care of the majority of poor people. Li Yihe of Dongpo Village appropriately grasped the policy of taking care of the families of military cadres. When the masses in the village liquidated the landlord Li Helin, a family member of a military cadre, Li Yihe, out of consideration for the spirit of care, advised him to be enlightened voluntarily, but he scolded the tenants instead. Yihe then led the masses to reason with him. After the landlord admitted his mistake, he persuaded the masses to give Li Helin the necessary care. The activists in Guojiazhuang in the old district educated the masses to break the concept of localism and take the attitude that farmers all over the world are one family, organized a joint struggle, jointly liquidated the illegal landlords, and rationally distributed the fruits, and the farmers were extremely united. The activists in Nanchen Village proposed a method of organizing the masses from few to many, enlightening the masses to struggle from their own suffering, solving problems immediately, and distributing fruits, and the masses' enthusiasm for struggle immediately improved a step further. Recently, the county farmers' association called on all cadres to be responsible for cultivating activists, existing activists should take apprentices, discover more activists, and the masses in the county should change their old minds into new minds and further deepen the movement.
