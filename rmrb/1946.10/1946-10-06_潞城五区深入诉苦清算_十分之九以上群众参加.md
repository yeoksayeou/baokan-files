　　Lucheng Fifth District Deepens Suffering and Liquidation
    Over Ninety Percent of the Masses Participate
    [Further News] In September, Lucheng Fifth District (New District) launched a mass movement even more intense than the high tide of struggle last year. The characteristic of this movement is a thoroughgoing suffering and liquidation. When the masses in Li Village were accusing the evil landlords of their crimes, three old men were so angry that they fainted. Women cooked together in mutual aid groups, and the vast majority automatically participated in speaking bitterness. Many women's voices became hoarse from crying. A mute wailed and gestured, describing the misery of begging from the evil landlord Wang Maolin's family during the famine, being knocked over, and being bitten by dogs. Even the evil landlord's lackeys were moved by the masses' suffering and participated in speaking bitterness. The leadership adopted the approach of "mobilizing door-to-door, mobilizing the whole family" for backward villages and backward masses in general villages, and a large number of activists emerged. In the past seven months of the movement, only 708 activists were produced, but this time, 669 new ones were produced. Fifty-six new activists emerged in Li Lin Gou village alone, thirty of whom were women. The whole family of the instructor in Dongtian Palace were activists. The leadership had clearly put forward the slogan of "uniting the middle peasants" in advance, and middle peasants participated very widely in the speaking bitterness struggle. Among the six hundred new activists, 288 were middle peasants. More than ninety percent of the masses in the whole district are now participating in the movement. Stubborn and unrepentant evil landlords, who had refused to bow their heads in the past, have now all bowed their heads. Many people who had hidden land and property for traitors and evil landlords also confessed one after another, compensated the masses for their losses, and most of them participated in the speaking bitterness and liquidation.

　　潞城五区深入诉苦清算
    十分之九以上群众参加
    【又讯】潞城五区（新区）于九月份掀起较去年斗争高潮时更为猛烈的群众运动。这次运动的特点是深入的诉苦清算。李村群众在控诉恶霸地主们的罪行时，有三个老汉气得昏绝过去。妇女们以互助组为单位合伙做饭，绝大部分都自动参加诉苦。好些妇女把嗓子都嚎哑了。一个哑子大哭大叫的用手比划着自己灾荒与恶霸王茂林家讨饭时被敲了碗，又放出狗来咬的惨状。连恶霸的狗腿，也受到群众诉苦的感化，参加了诉苦。领导上对落后村及一般村庄的落后群众，采取“挨门发动，全家发动”，积极分子大量涌现出来，过去七个月运动中只产生了七百零八个积极分子，这一次新产生的即达六百六十九人。李林沟一村涌现出五十六个新积极分子，其中三十个是妇女。东天宫指导员全家都是积极分子。领导上事先曾明确提出“团结中农”的口号，中农参加诉苦斗争非常普遍。六百多个新积极分子中，有二百八十八人是中农。全区参加运动的群众，现已达到百分之九十以上。顽固不化的恶霸地主，过去一直不肯低头的，这次都低了头。好些为汉奸恶霸隐藏土地财产的人，也都纷纷坦白出来，赔偿群众损失，并多数参加了诉苦清算。（柳林）
