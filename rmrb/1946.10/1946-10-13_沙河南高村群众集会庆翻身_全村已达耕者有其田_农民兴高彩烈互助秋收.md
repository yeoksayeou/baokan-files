　　【Changzhi, 9th Dispatch】With the help of the Liberation Team from the Military and Political University, the peasants of Shahe Nangao Village have realized "Tillers Own Their Land." At a celebration rally for the victory of liberation held a few days ago, all the villagers not only expressed their warm gratitude to all the comrades of the team but also sent three foreign milk goats to the leaders of the Military and Political University. Attached was a letter saying: "Your school's Liberation Team, including Zhang Kewen and seven other comrades, helped us completely overthrow the heads of feudal forces such as the big tyrant Wen Zhibin in our village. Now those in our village who had no land have land, those who had no houses have houses, and those who had no food and clothing have food and clothing. These days, we are organizing mutual aid to rush the autumn harvest. Everyone is very happy. We are endlessly grateful to all the leaders for caring about us so much. Now we are sending three goats for you to drink goat's milk and protect your health so you can do more for us, the common people."
