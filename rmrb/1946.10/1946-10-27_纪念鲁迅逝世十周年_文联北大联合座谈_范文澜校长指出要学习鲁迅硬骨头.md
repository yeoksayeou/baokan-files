　　Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death
    Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Peking University Hold Joint Symposium
    President Fan Wenlan Points Out the Need to Learn from Lu Xun's Unyielding Spirit
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Literary Research Office of Northern University jointly held a symposium on the 19th to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. President Fan Wenlan, Academic Dean Zhang Baiyuan, Dean Zhang Zonglin of the College of Literature and Education, and Mr. Wang Jin, Wang Nan, as well as comrades from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles including Hei Ding, Ge Luo, Zeng Ke, Hu Zheng, Rotterdam, Si Ji, and all faculty and students from the Literary Research Office, totaling more than seventy people, attended. A portrait of Mr. Lu Xun was hung in the center of the venue, and quotations from Mr. Lu Xun were posted all around. The symposium began at 10:00 AM and proceeded in a solemn atmosphere. Comrade Hei Ding first delivered an opening speech, briefly discussing Mr. Lu Xun's lifelong fighting direction. President Fan then reported, saying: "Mr. Lu Xun is the banner of the new cultural army. We who engage in cultural work are all soldiers under Lu Xun's banner. I hope that all comrades can advance under Lu Xun's banner. Mr. Lu Xun's bones are indeed hard. Today, after we have defeated Japanese imperialism, American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek have come again. They are uniting to attack the people. This force cannot be ignored, and the struggle will be long-term and arduous. Therefore, we must show an unyielding spirit and defeat American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek just as we defeated Japanese imperialism and Wang Jingwei." "Sacrificing oneself for the people is the direction Mr. Lu Xun gave us." Dean Zhang Zonglin contrasted the Kuomintang area's persecution of Mr. Lu Xun with the liberated area's respect for Mr. Lu Xun. He called on the students, saying: "Learn from Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of not seeking personal gain and wholeheartedly serving the people." Then, Academic Dean Zhang Baiyuan and Professor Wang Nan also spoke successively. Comrades from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and many students from the Literary Research Office also spoke enthusiastically. Finally, Comrade Lu Li said: "We must firmly establish our position and learn from Mr. Lu Xun's courage. We must test a soldier in arduous struggles. We do not feel tired, and we believe that we will win!" The symposium was enthusiastically held until 3:30 PM. After the meeting, students Wu Shaohua and Yang Zhemin recited Mr. Lu Xun's posthumous works: "In Memory of Liu Hezhen" and "Who Killed the Wrong Person."

    【本报讯】边区文联与北方大学文艺研究室，于十九日联合举行鲁迅先生逝世十周年纪念座谈会。到范文澜校长，张柏园教务长，文教学院张宗麟院长和王锦第、王南诸先生，文联黑丁、葛洛、曾克、胡征、鹿特丹、思基等同志，文艺研究室夏青、鲁藜、罗工柳、陈因和全体教职学员共七十余人。会场正中悬挂鲁迅先生遗像，四周贴满鲁迅先生语录。座谈会自上午十时开始，在严肃空气中进行。首由黑丁同志致开会词，略谈鲁迅先生一生的战斗方向。范校长接着报告说：“鲁迅先生是文化新军的旗子，我们作文化工作的人都是鲁迅旗帜下的战士，我希望各位同志能够在鲁迅的旗帜下前进。鲁迅先生的骨头的确是硬的。我们已经打垮了日本帝国主义的今天，又来了美帝国主义和蒋介石，他们联合起来向人民进攻，这个力量是不容忽视的，斗争是长期的，艰苦的。所以我们要拿出硬骨头来，像打垮日本帝国主义和汪精卫一样打垮美帝国主义和蒋介石。”“牺牲自己，为了人民，才是鲁迅先生给我们的方向”。张宗麟院长把国民党地区的迫害鲁迅先生和今天解放区的崇敬鲁迅先生，加以对照的说明后。他号召同学们说：“学习鲁迅先生的不求功利，全心全意为人民服务的精神。”接着张柏园教务长、王南教授均相继讲话。文联同志和文艺研究室好多同学也都热烈的发言。最后、鲁藜同志说：“我们要坚定我们的立场，学习鲁迅先生的勇敢。在艰苦的斗争中去考验一个战士，我们没有疲倦的感觉，我们相信我们会胜利！”座谈会热烈的开到下午三时半。会后，由吴绍华和杨哲民两同学朗诵鲁迅先生遗作：“纪念刘和珍君”及“谁杀错了人。”
