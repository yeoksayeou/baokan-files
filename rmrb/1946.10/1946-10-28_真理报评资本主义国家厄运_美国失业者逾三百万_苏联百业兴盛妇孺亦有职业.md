Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. TASS Moscow dispatch: A Pravda observer wrote an article analyzing the unemployment problem in capitalist countries, pointing out that unemployment has become a real problem in highly developed countries that suffered the least damage in the war, such as the United States. A large number of Americans are still in the army, and the US military is still stationed in China, the Near East, and European countries under every possible pretext, but there are already millions of unemployed in the United States. According to a report from the Veterans Administration, the number of unemployed in the United States has exceeded three million, including one million veterans, but in fact, the number of unemployed is greater than this. Although many American leaders have tried to appease the people, claiming that unemployment has not reached the level of six to eight million, as predicted by some economists, unemployment is constantly increasing. The observer, when discussing the unemployment problem in Britain, emphasized that although British industrial activity has temporarily increased after the war, it is still far from eliminating unemployment. In Germany, under the control of Britain and the United States, the number of unemployed has reached about 2.5 million. There are 2.5 million unemployed in Italy, and foreign capital is using unemployment to economically enslave Italy. As for Japan, according to reports from government agencies, the number of unemployed will reach over 5.5 million by October.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. Associated Press Moscow dispatch: While workers in capitalist countries (especially the United States) are facing large-scale unemployment, not only does everyone in the Soviet Union have a job, but Soviet newspapers everywhere publish "Help Wanted" advertisements every day, and "Help Wanted" signs are hung high at the gates of factories. The new Soviet Five-Year Plan requires seven million new workers in industrial transportation construction departments, and millions of workers are also needed in various collective farms. The Soviet government is now planning to train a large number of skilled workers. Nearly 400,000 young skilled workers have graduated from labor reserve schools, and it is expected that this will reach 1.2 million by 1950. A large textile factory in the Orekhovo-Zuevo district has opened ten schools to train young textile workers, and other factories have similar measures. Soviet workers can freely choose jobs they are capable of, and the government and trade unions will never force them, but those who have received certain specialized training in schools cannot change careers after graduation. Although the number of people demobilized after the war is very large, the need for workers is even greater. In order to solve the labor problem, Soviet newspapers have discussed two methods: one is to further improve work efficiency through reward methods, and the other is to recruit young workers from collective farms and other rural areas. The wartime loss of workers in Belarus and Ukraine reached 80 percent. Currently, work is being done by women, children, the elderly, and the weak. Women in cities, as during the war, are replacing men in working, driving trams and buses, and policing.

　　真理报评资本主义国家厄运
    美国失业者逾三百万
    苏联百业兴盛妇孺亦有职业
    【新华社延安二十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家著文分析资本主义国家中之失业问题，指出失业在高度发展而在战争中受损失最小之国家如美国，已成为现实问题，大量美国人仍在军队中，而且美军在每一可能的借口下仍留驻中国、近东及欧洲国家，但在美国境内失业者已达数百万人。据退伍军人管理处报告：美国失业人数已逾三百万，其中退伍军人一百万，然事实上失业人数较此数为大。许多美国领袖虽设法缓和人民，声称失业尚未达六百万至八百万之程度，有如若干经济学者所预言者，但失业正在不断激增。该观察家论及英国失业问题时，力言战后英国工业活动虽暂时增加，然离消灭失业还甚远。在英美控制下之德国境内，失业人数已达二百五十万左右，意大利已有二百五十万人失业，外国资本正借失业以谋在经济上奴役意大利。至于日本，据政府机关之报告，失业人数至十月将达五百五十万以上。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】美联社莫斯科讯：当资本主义国家（特别是美国）工人大批失业之际，苏联不但人人有工作做，而且苏联各地报纸每日均刊登“招工”广告，工厂门首亦皆高悬“招工”牌子。苏联新五年计划中工业运输建设各部门计需新工人七百万名，各集体农场亦需工人数百万，现苏联政府正计划训练大批熟练工人，劳工预备学校近约有四十万青年熟练工人毕业，至一九五○年预料可达一百廿万人。奥勒可夫——朱叶夫区某大纺织厂已开办学校十处，训练青年纺织工人，其他各工厂亦有同样措施。苏联工人对凡能胜任之工作可自由选择，政府及工会方面决不强制，惟在学校受某种专门训练者，毕业后不能改业。战后复员之人为数虽很多，但工人需要甚大。为解决劳工问题，苏联报纸曾对二种办法加以讨论，一种是从奖励的方法更加提高其工作效率，另一种拟向集体农场及其他乡区招募青工。白俄罗斯及乌克兰战时工人损失达百分之八十，目前工作系由妇孺老弱担任，城市中妇女仍如战时一样，代替男子作工、驾驶电车、公共汽车及警察等。
