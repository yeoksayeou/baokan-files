    Hull Wounded in Assassination Attempt

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] American news agencies previously reported that former U.S. Secretary of State Hull was hospitalized, and on his 75th birthday (October 1st), he delivered a speech from his sickbed appealing for international unity. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington: Hull's hospitalization was due to injuries sustained in an assassination attempt by a naval officer on September 30th. Hull was Secretary of State during the Roosevelt era and was known for advocating peace and limiting arms expansion. He was also the first American to discover Nazi ambitions and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Hull's condition was once very dangerous but has now stabilized.

　　美反动派无耻暴行
    赫尔被刺受伤
    【新华社延安二十一日电】美各通讯社前曾报导美前国务卿赫尔入院就医，并于七秩晋五寿辰（十月一日）在病榻上发表呼吁国际团结之谠论。兹据英国路透社华府电讯：赫尔之入医院，系因九月三十日遭受一海军人员行刺受伤所致。按赫尔为罗斯福时代之国务卿，曾以主张和平及限制扩张军备闻名，并为美国发现纳粹野心之第一人，且曾为诺贝尔和平奖金之获得者。赫尔伤势一度甚为危险，现已转危为安。
