　　【Our Newspaper, Wei County, 18th Dispatch】After Jize County arranged for rent reduction verification, the County National Salvation Association, the County Government Education Section, the District Office, and the Party's District Committee, etc., separately convened training classes for worker, peasant, and women cadres from various villages, teacher training classes, expanded branch committee meetings, village administration expanded meetings, etc., and also absorbed village activists, labor heroes, and model militiamen to participate. Over a thousand people attended and received training. Everyone further recognized that only by thoroughly eliminating feudal exploitation and enabling all peasants to stand up can the landlords' counterattack be stopped. At the joint meeting of cadres and activists in Beifengzheng Village, many problems from the incomplete mass movement last winter were examined, and the reasons why the masses had not completely turned themselves over were examined: First, the fruits of victory were not distributed in a timely manner, which affected the morale of the masses. Some landlords who should have been struggled against were let go, and as a result, the movement failed to continue to develop. Second, there was insufficient vigilance against the landlords' counterattack conspiracies. For example, after the mass movement came to an end, landlords used methods such as false pledging and false sales to disperse land in an attempt to evade the peasants' liquidation struggle. Some opportunistic landlords were falsely active, helping village cadres with accounting during the struggle, thus blurring the masses' understanding of them and relaxing the liquidation against them. Third, some landlords carried out counterattacks through threats and inducements. The local tyrant landlord Zhou Fatang even made village cadres use livestock even if he didn't plow the land himself. Zhou Dongbao and the chairman of the trade union bought a cart together, and he provided the money. He said, "You have to be more open-minded when doing things in the future! Can this be the way things are forever? We are all fellow villagers." Some, in order to avoid liquidation by the peasants, secretly transported things out of their homes, and so on. After the examination, everyone's thinking became clearer, and it was decided to immediately carry out the following tasks: (1) Militiamen will be on guard at night to prevent landlords from engaging in sabotage; (2) Consolidate various mass organizations, expose the landlords' various conspiracies, and deliberate on the targets of rent reduction verification; (3) Cultivate activists and connect with the aggrieved; (4) Distribute the fruits of victory as you struggle, especially taking care of the families of martyrs. Each family member of a martyr will receive an average of six mu of land.

　　【Our Newspaper, Wei County, 16th Dispatch】After Yuanchao County arranged for rent reduction verification at the end of September, the entire county has now entered a stage of widespread and in-depth mobilization. At the beginning of this month, the first, fifth, seventh, and other districts successively convened village cadres, mass leaders, and model worker conferences. The conference enthusiastically discussed rent reduction methods, proposing to overcome phenomena such as "letting go without reassurance" and "ostensible non-involvement but actual involvement," and to avoid abrupt changes of direction and pouring cold water. It is necessary to concentrate efforts to break through feudal fortresses and carry out joint struggles. All cadres and activists unanimously stated that "we must help the masses to turn themselves over completely." After the meeting, all the villages in the district immediately became a sensation. Within five days, the fifth district had forty-one villages and more than 15,000 people involved in the rent reduction movement. Everywhere there were gongs and drums, and everywhere there were group meetings and representative meetings. On the 3rd, the masses in the entire district held a large demonstration parade. The loud slogans of "We want to turn ourselves over completely," "Everyone must have food, clothing, and land to cultivate," "Middle and poor peasants are one family, unite and work together," and "Resolutely eliminate feudal exploitation" shook the fields of the fifth district. The local tyrant landlords such as Xiao Zaitao, Dong Dajiang, and Zhao Liandeng were arrested, and more than forty peasants poured out their grievances on the spot and settled accounts with the local tyrant landlords. The whole audience shouted: "This time our strength is great, we must turn ourselves over completely."

　　鸡泽结合检查动员查减
    北风正发现地主瞒地
    元朝克服“放手不放心”运动深入开展
    【本报威县十八日电】鸡泽县布置查减后，县救国会、县府教育科、区公所、党的区委会等分头召开各村工、农、妇干部训练班、教员训练班、支委扩大会、村政扩大会等，并吸收村积极分子，劳动英雄，模范民兵参加。与会及受训者前后共千余人，大家进一步认识只有彻底消灭封建剥削，全体农民翻身，才能停止地主的反攻。在北风正村干积极分子联席会上，并检查出去年冬天群众运动不彻底的许多问题，并检查出群众没有翻透身的原因：一，没有及时分果实，影响群众情绪，有些该斗的地主被放过了，因而运动未能继续开展。二是对地主反攻阴谋警惕不够，如群运告一段落后，地主以假当、假卖疏散土地等办法，企图逃避农民清算斗争。还有的投机地主假积极，斗争时帮助村干记账，因而模糊了群众对他的认识，放松了对他清算。三，有的地主以威胁利诱等办法，实行反攻。恶霸地主周法堂甚至自己不犁地也要让村干使牲口。周东保和工会主任伙买小车，他出钱。并说：“往后做事要想开些呀！能光是这世道吗？都是乡里乡亲的。”有的则为避免农民清算，把家里的东西往外偷运等等。经检查后，大家思想一下明确起来，决定马上进行以下几项工作：（一）民兵晚上站岗防备地主偷捣鬼；（二）整理各群众组织揭破地主各种阴谋诡计酝酿查减对象；（三）培养积极分子，串连苦主；（四）果实随斗随分，特别照顾烈士家属。烈属每人平均分到六亩地。
    【本报威县十六日电】元朝县九月底布置查减后，全县现已进入普遍深入发动阶段。本月初，一、五、七等区纷纷召开村干部、群众领袖、工作模范大会。会中热烈讨论查减办法，提出克服“放手不放心”“明不包暗包”等现象，并切忌硬转弯、泼冷水。要集中力量攻破封建堡垒，开展联合斗争。全体干部积极分子一致表示“要帮助群众翻透身”。会后全区各村马上轰动起来了，五区五天内即有四十一村，万五千余人卷入查减运动。到处锣鼓喧天，到处开小组会、代表会。三日那天全区群众举行一个大示威游行，“我们要彻底翻身”“要人人有饭吃、有衣穿、有地种”“中贫农是一家，团结起来一齐干”、“坚决消灭封建剥削”响亮的口号，震动了五区的原野。并扣起小寨涛、东大江、赵连登等恶霸大地主，四十多个农民当场倾吐苦水，向恶霸地主们算账，全场高呼：“这次咱们力量大啦，可得把身翻得透透的。”
