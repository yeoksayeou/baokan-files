　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 29th] In Southern Hebei, the army recruitment movement is still developing vigorously. In the ten days from mid-October to late October, over six thousand young adults from Zaoqiang, Pingxiang, Wuxun and ten other counties joined the army. In Zaoqiang, Pingxiang, and Wuxun, every village had people joining the army and no one was alone in joining the army. Party member cadres launched a heroic competition, taking the lead. In Pingxiang, 152 party member cadres led over 600 young adults to collectively enlist. In Gaozhuang, a small village in the 6th District of Linqing with 19 households, four party members collectively joined the army. In Weizhuang, led by the branch secretary, 27 party members and over ten members of the masses surged into the People's Liberation Army. In Baitaiji, four demobilized soldiers led four militiamen to the battlefield for a second time. The masses in Wangmenzhuang and Zhangyin, out of anger at the reactionaries, made paper figures of Chiang Kai-shek and "Little Chiang Kai-shek" to voice their grievances and ask questions. At the meeting, sixteen party members became heroes in leading the way to join the army. The director of the trade union in Dongli Yuan Village, Weixian, had just gotten engaged when he heard that Chiang Kai-shek wanted to take away the poor people's food. He became anxious and clenched his fists, saying, "Damn him! I'll defeat Chiang Kai-shek and then get married and live a happy life." With his fiancée's consent, he led the masses to the front lines. Women cadres and party members played an active role in promoting army recruitment. Stories of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and fathers and sons competing to join the army to avenge their parents on the front lines emerged one after another. This is a characteristic of solving the land problem for peasants and a practical action of the masses' resentment towards the Chiang bandits. Currently, liberated peasants in various places are still continuously rushing to the front lines.
　　
　　[Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 29th] On October 6th, people from all walks of life in Boping County held a banquet to joyfully send off over a thousand brave men to the front lines. After the new soldiers from Renping and Boping counties gathered in Boping City, they established a Turn-Over Corps on the 5th, with Comrade Liu Zhenqi, a member of the Boping County Party Committee, as the head. The morale of all the soldiers was extremely high. Guo Jinye, a soldier in the 4th company, got up again that night to go home and mobilize people. The next morning, he called two new soldiers back with him. Each battalion and company unanimously swore, "We will not return to Renping and Boping until we defeat the Chiang bandits!" Early in the morning of the 6th, people from all walks of life in the city organized to send them off. The Farmers' Association, Women's Federation, and Children's Corps had already set up wine and dishes on the streets to wait for them. All the shops and stores also had wine, dishes, tea, and fruits placed in front of their doors. For a time, gongs and drums were loud, and slogans were raised everywhere. As the new soldiers marched past with their chests held high, everyone raised their glasses to toast them, and the new soldiers shouted loudly, "We will resolutely fight Chiang Kai-shek on the front lines to respond to the kindness of our elders." Crowds followed to see them off, all the way to the West Gate. Head Liu gave a reply to the elders who were seeing them off: "We will resolutely eliminate the enemy on the front lines. Let's reunite when we defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" After that, the new soldiers happily marched to the front lines.
