　　Taihang Post Office Enthusiastically Donates Money

　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 7th] The patriotic movement of "saving on food and clothing, donating money and goods to support the front lines" is being enthusiastically carried out in the Taihang Postal Bureau.

　　They formulated specific plans from examining wasteful phenomena, deciding to save half of the office expenses and one-third of the food expenses; and according to the work situation, they arranged for two shifts, morning and afternoon, to rush to harvest the autumn crops, ensuring that all the agency's land was planted with wheat. At the same time, many comrades voluntarily donated their personal savings and living allowances to the soldiers at the front. The Management Bureau, with only the remaining agency staff, donated 3,540 yuan in silver, 280 jin of millet, and items such as towels, shoes, and soap. The Changzhi City Post Office donated a total of 2,460 yuan in silver, 365 jin of millet, and six towels. The Zuoquan Chengguan Post Station donated a total of 187 yuan in silver and 120 jin of millet. The Jiaozuo City Post Office formulated specific production and savings plans. Niu Xiaoshuan, a postal worker at the Xuexin Post Station, said: "The troops at the front are sacrificing blood, fighting desperately to kill the enemy, we who work in the postal service should deliver official documents, newspapers, and letters to the front lines as quickly as possible." Wang Lianxi, a postal worker at the Xiyang Post Office, encouraged by the victory of the self-defense war, ran 142 and a half li in one day. He often said: "The news in the newspapers is very important, running faster can let the front see it sooner." (Yao Cheng)
