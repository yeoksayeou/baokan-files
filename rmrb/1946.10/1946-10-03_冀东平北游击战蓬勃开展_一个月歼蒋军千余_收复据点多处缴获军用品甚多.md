Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 30th—The Pingbei District (the area between the Ping-Sui and Ping-Gu lines north of Beiping) is launching extensive mass guerrilla warfare to coordinate with the Hebei Province self-defense war. Since late August, the local armed militias of Changping, Huairou, and Shunyi have successively captured Yuehetan and Kuangtucun in southern Changping, as well as Geliang and Zhangxinzhuang in Shunyi. According to incomplete statistics, the number of Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops annihilated and captured has reached 1,072. Among them, 770 Chiang Kai-shek troops were annihilated in one instance when they invaded Jiulishansi, Changping, in late August, and five light machine guns, 79 rifles, and many other military supplies were seized. The communication and telecommunication links of the Chiang Kai-shek troops are frequently cut off by the militia guerrillas. Following the destruction of five railway bridges between Shunyi and Huairou on the Ping-Gu road, more than 1,500 Shunyi militiamen completely destroyed 15 miles of roadbed north of Tongxian this month, harvesting more than 5,000 catties of electric wire. On the 11th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops patrolled Shunyi and were blown up by landmines near the Shunyi South Station, killing ten and seriously injuring two. In retaliation, Chiang Kai-shek's troops dispatched a battalion to search and suppress the area, but they were ambushed by militia guerrillas hidden in the tall crops and stepped on three landmines, killing 16 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei Front, 30th—The army and people in various parts of the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area have continuously won victories in their counterattacks against the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. In the past half-month, from the 13th to the present, a total of 224 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers have been killed or wounded, 429 have been captured alive, and 15 American-style light and heavy machine guns and 381 rifles have been seized. In this week, the self-defense war in the mountainous areas and the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the plains have been closely coordinated. The mass guerrilla warfare in the Xianghe-Sanhe area east of the North Canal is flourishing everywhere. Within a week, Dachang and Huangzhuangzhen in Xianghe, and Goufu, Maqifa, and Zhugezhuang in Sanhe have been successively recovered. In the Shunyi area, on the 13th, the Shunyi local armed forces defeated more than 100 invading puppet security troops in Ligezhuang, east of the city, and continued to pursue them, encircling and annihilating the bandits the next morning. On the 21st, after a fierce battle overnight, Yanggezhuang and Nancaizhen, two major strongholds of Shunyi, were recovered. In the Jixian area, the 1st Battalion of the 168th Regiment of the 56th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which invaded Jiubaihu in Jixian on the 14th, was ambushed by local guerrillas when they invaded Luanyingzi, killing more than 20. On the 20th, guerrillas ambushed a Chiang Kai-shek transport team on the Xinggezhuang highway south of Jixian, seizing two trucks loaded with flour and military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 30th—The Huairou local corps, which persisted in self-defense guerrilla warfare along the Great Wall, launched a surprise attack on the Tiangezhuang (15 miles west of Miyun) Chiang Kai-shek and puppet army stronghold on the evening of the 22nd. After an hour of fierce fighting, all of the more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops entrenched there were defeated, and Tiangezhuang was liberated. In this battle, a total of 46 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops were captured, 17 were killed or wounded, and one light machine gun and 18 rifles were seized.
