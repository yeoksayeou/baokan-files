Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 27th: With the exception of a few areas that suffered from disasters and reduced harvests, the liberated areas and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region generally exceeded last year's harvests. The autumn harvest in Yan'an County, on average, almost doubled last year's. The masses happily said: "The more grain we harvest, the more strength we have to defend the border region." In the Taihang and Taiyue areas of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, the harvest of farmers' sideline occupations is comparable to the autumn harvest. This bumper harvest has made the people of the area well-fed and clothed, and many villages have achieved "cultivating three years' worth of food with four years' work." For example, the people of Shuimen Village in the Xingtai mountainous area used to eat chaff and vegetables; but since the implementation of land reform, poor farmers have obtained land, and all the labor force in the village has participated in mutual aid groups. This year, there are no poor farmers in the village, and everyone has generally achieved "cultivating three years' worth of food with four years' work." The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government issued 80 million yuan in agricultural loans this spring to solve farmers' difficulties with tools, plows, and seeds, which played a significant role in this year's bumper harvest. The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area harvested more than 8 million shi of wheat in the summer, and the entire region is reporting another bumper autumn harvest. The plains of central Hebei and other places have all had full harvests. The democratic government of the liberated area issued 40 million yuan in loans this spring to fully assist the masses in production. Subsequently, it led the people to build 557 large canals, turning more than 1 million mu of dry land into paddy fields, and built 122 dikes and opened 20 new rivers stretching over 80 li. In total, the result of this water conservancy construction was the new construction and restoration of more than 3 million mu of paddy fields. The harvest from these paddy fields is one to several times greater than that from dry land. After the peasants in various places gained a new life through the liquidation of rent reduction, their enthusiasm for labor increased unprecedentedly, and production mutual aid organizations were widely promoted, thereby further improving labor efficiency. For example, after rent reduction in Anguo County, central Hebei, more than 30 percent of the villages in the county organized production mutual aid groups, which is also a major reason for the bumper harvest. After the people of the Suwan Liberated Area overcame the spring famine that occurred this spring through mutual assistance and government relief, the government immediately led the people to step up production. This year, the entire liberated area dredged 97 rivers, directly benefiting 2 million mu of fertile land. In Dongtai and Taibei in central Jiangsu, beggars and thieves have started their own businesses as a result of land reform and bumper harvests. Fourteen beggars in Taixing Township, Taizhong District, Taibei, were divided into a total of 73 mu of land. The government urged them to work hard in production, and provided them with loans before the autumn harvest. The masses also lent them farm tools. After the bumper autumn harvest this year, they are all well-fed and clothed. In the Shandong Liberated Area, the autumn harvest has been completed in various places and is being rushed. The output in various parts of the region has exceeded previous years. In the Binhai District, each mu of cotton field yielded an average of more than 30 jin, completely solving the problem of clothing. Zheng Xincun, a labor hero in Ju County, increased the village's autumn grain by three times compared with last year. The 32 farming households in Shiquanhu Village, the county, averaged two years' worth of cultivating and one year's worth of surplus. All parts of the Northeast Liberated Area have also experienced bumper harvests. The autumn harvest in the provinces of Nenjiang and Heilongjiang is unprecedented in more than a decade. After obtaining land, the farmers in various places are harvesting with joy as masters, helping each other with harvesting and collective threshing, and using the fruits of liquidation to collectively purchase livestock for harvesting. Yuan, the village chief of Ping'an Village, Taonan, was divided into 128 qing of land (10 mu per qing) this spring. Now, with the bumper harvest, he pointed to the sorghum fields, which were red on all sides, and said happily to others: "This year, we can harvest at least 200 shi of grain, which will be enough to live a comfortable life." Farmers in the marginal areas of the second sub-district of Liaoning and Jilin, under the slogan of "Take up guns and protect our food bowls," have organized self-defense forces to defend the autumn harvest and oppose the Kuomintang army colluding with bandits to loot grain. The Changbai Mountains area has also had a full harvest, with the main crops of sorghum and corn yielding 300 to 500 jin per mu. This area experienced a spring famine this spring, which was safely overcome due to government relief. Then, the policy of "land to the tiller" was implemented, and a production campaign was launched. The farmers' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. During the summer drought, they irrigated the green seedlings day and night to overcome the drought, resulting in a good harvest. In the counties of Yabei, Jin Sui, the combination of labor and military was implemented, and the militia and local corps jointly defended the autumn harvest.

　　自卫战争获得有力物质基础
    各解放区均告丰收
    【新华社延安二十七日电】各解放区与陕甘宁边区，除个别地区受灾歉收外，一般的超过去年之收成。延安县秋禾之收获，平均几超过去年一倍。群众都高兴的说：多收一点粮食，就多一分保卫边区的力量。晋冀鲁豫边区的太行太岳等地，农民副业之收获，亦与秋收媲美。此种丰收，使该区人民衣食丰足，许多村庄已做到“耕三余一”。如邢台山川区之水门村人民，过去向以糠菜为食；但自实行土地改革后，贫苦农民获得土地，全村劳力参加互助组，今年全村已无一户贫农，普遍做到“耕三余一。”晋冀鲁豫边区政府，于今春曾发放八万万元之农业贷款，解决农民之工具耕牛种籽等困难，对今年之丰收起了很大作用。晋察冀解放区夏季收麦八百余万石，全境秋禾又告丰收。冀中平原等地，皆有十足年成。该解放区民主政府，今春曾发放四十万万贷款，全力帮助群众生产。嗣后又领导人民修筑五五七道大水渠，使一百余万亩旱地变成水田，并修筑堤坝一二二道，开辟长达八十余里的新河二十道。总计此种水利建设之结果，新修及恢复水田三百余万亩。此种水田之收获，皆较旱地增多一倍至数倍。各地农民于清算减租获得翻身后，劳动热情空前提高，生产互助组织普遍推广，从而更加提高劳动效率。如冀中安国县经减租后，全县即有百分之三十以上的村庄组织生产互助组，此亦丰收之重大原因。苏皖解放区人民互助及政府救济战胜今春所发生之春荒后，政府即领导人民加紧生产，全解放区今年浚河九十七条，使二百万亩良田直接受益。苏中东台、台北等地，由于土地改革及丰收之结果，乞丐小偷皆兴家立业。台北太中区泰兴乡十四个叫化子共分得土地七十三亩，政府督促其勤劳生产，秋收前又给他们发放贷款，群众也纷纷借农具给他们，今年秋季丰收后，他们都衣食丰足。山东解放区，各地秋禾已收割完毕，并已赶打，全区各地产量均超过往年。滨海区每亩棉田，平均收获在三十斤以上，穿衣问题全部解决。莒县劳动英雄郑信村，全村秋粮较去年增加三倍。该县石泉湖庄三十二户农民，平均做到耕二余一。东北解放区各地亦均遇丰收，嫩江黑龙江各省，秋禾丰稔为十余年所未有。各地农民于获得土地后，正以主人的欣喜心情，互助收割、集体打场，并用清算所得之果实，集体购买牲口赶收。洮南平安村袁村长，今春分了一百二十八垧地（每垧十亩），现遇丰收，他指着四面红成一片的高粱地欣喜地向人说：“今年至少能打二百多石粮，可以丰衣足食了。”辽吉二分区边缘地区农民，并在“拿起枪杆保住饭碗”的口号下，纷纷组织自卫队保卫秋收，反对蒋军勾结胡匪抢粮。长白山一带，均有十足年成，主要农作物高粱、苞米等每亩可收三百至五百斤。该地区今春发生春荒，由于政府之救济而安全渡过。继即实行耕者有其田，开展生产运动，农民生产情绪空前提高，今夏天旱时，即日以继夜灌溉青苗战胜旱灾，致获良好收成。晋绥雁北各县实行劳武结合，民兵与地方兵团共同保卫秋收。
