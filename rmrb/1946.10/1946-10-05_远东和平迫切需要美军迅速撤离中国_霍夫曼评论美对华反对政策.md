　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Moscow Radio today: Commentator Hoffman commented on the U.S. policy toward China, pointing out that the presence of U.S. troops in China has become an international issue because these troops threaten peace in the Far East. Stalin's conversation and Gromyko's statement both paid special attention to the situation in China, believing that the quickest possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from China is urgently needed for peace. The withdrawal of U.S. troops from China has become the current slogan of the Chinese people and American democrats. U.S. President Truman receives telegrams and declarations every day from American democratic organizations and progressive groups demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. A movement demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China is now underway in the United States, North China, and Central China. The presence of U.S. troops in China is the result of a secret conspiracy between Chinese and American reactionaries against the Chinese people. Chinese newspapers have emphasized that the U.S. military presence has seized control of China's national defense. Shen Bao pointed out: The U.S. military advisory group in China has begun training special Kuomintang troops and supplying the Kuomintang with new weapons to fight against Chinese democratic forces. The presence of U.S. troops in China indicates that U.S. monopoly groups are trying to seize world domination. The Chinese, American, and all other freedom-loving people and progressive forces are fighting against this reactionary policy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Moscow, 29th, broadcast a short commentary in Izvestia entitled "The Source of Chinese Rumors," pointing out that U.S. warships operate in China with as much freedom as if they were at home, "B-35" airplanes are sold to China as scrap iron, U.S. military supplies from the Pacific are sold to China at one-third of their original price under the guise of non-military supplies, and U.S. Marines are building long-term barracks in China. Kuomintang pilots are piloting U.S. planes to bomb Chinese villages. The United States, wearing the mask of mediating the Chinese civil war, is actively interfering in China's internal affairs, constantly adding fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war. The Chinese reactionaries are placing their own crimes on others, demonstrating their baseness and shamelessness! The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao fabricated a report that a speedboat flying the Soviet flag was carrying military supplies to Yantai and Weihaiwei, and then the Central Daily News fabricated a rumor that six hundred naval-armed Soviet soldiers had entered Harbin. The Chinese reactionaries are using base rumors to cover up the actions of their boss. The tricks played by these liars are a reflection of the rumors used by the United States. A rumor spread by the American-China Association fabricated a directive from the CCP Politburo on the 16th, allegedly saying that the CCP had obtained warships and military supplies from the Soviet Union. These confused inventors said they had obtained approval from the Far Eastern Bureau of the Comintern (note: the Comintern has long been dissolved). These liars are trying to prove something that no one will believe: that it is not the United States but the Soviet Union that is interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　远东和平迫切需要美军迅速撤离中国
    霍夫曼评论美对华反对政策
    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科今日广播：评论员霍夫曼评论美国对华政策，指出美军驻在中国已成为国际问题，因为这些军队威胁远东和平。斯大林谈话与葛罗米柯声明，均特别注意到中国的情况，认为美军最迅速地从中国撤退，是和平所迫切需要。美军退出中国，已成为中国人民与美国民主社会人士目前的口号。美总统杜鲁门每天接到美国民主组织与进步团体的电信与宣言，要求立刻从中国撤退美军。在美国、华北及华中各地，现时已展开要求美军退出中国的运动，美军驻在中国是中美两国反动派反对中国人民秘密勾结的结果。中国报纸并着重指出：美驻军夺取了中国国防统制权。申报指出：在中国的美国军事顾问团开始训练国民党特别军队，并供给国民党新式武器与中国民主力量作战。美军驻在中国，是表示美国垄断集团力图夺取世界统治地位。中美及其它一切爱好自由的人民与进步力量，正在进行斗争，反对这一反动政策。
    【新华社延安一日电】莫斯科二十九日广播消息报短评“中国谣言的来源”中指出，美国军舰在中国活动，像在家里一样自由，“Ｂ３５”式飞机当作废铁出卖给中国，太平洋美军用品以非军用品名义以原价三分之一价格卖给中国，美海军陆战队并在中国建筑长期居住的营房。国民党飞行员正驾驶美机轰炸中国乡村，美国戴着调停中国内战的假面具，积极干涉中国内政，对中国内战不断火上加油，中国反动派却把自己的罪名加在别人身上，表现出其下贱无耻！上海大公报捏造悬挂苏联旗帜的汽艇上，载着军用品到烟台与威海卫的消息，接着中央日报又造谣六百名海军武装的苏联士兵，已入哈尔滨。中国反动派以下贱的谣言来掩盖自己老板的行动。这些骗子玩弄的把戏，是美国所采用的谣言的反映。美中协会散布的一个谣言，捏造中共政治局十六日指令，似乎说中共已自苏联得到军舰与军用品，这些糊涂发明家，说他们已得到共产国际远东局的批准（按：共产国际早已解散）。这些骗子们企图证明使人不会相信的东西：似乎干涉中国内政的，不是美国而是苏联。
