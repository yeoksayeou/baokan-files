TASS Original Dispatch

[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] The New China News Agency broadcast on September 25th Stalin's reply to a British reporter's interview, which was recorded from Moscow spoken broadcast. Now we have obtained the original TASS telegram, which is re-broadcast below for correction.

[TASS News] Alexander Werth, the Moscow correspondent for the British *Sunday Times*, submitted several questions in writing to Marshal Stalin on September 17, 1946. These questions concerned the current political situation and the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Mr. Werth's questions and Marshal Stalin's replies are recorded below:

Q: Regarding a "new war," there is so much irresponsible talk going on around the world right now. Do you believe there is a real danger of this "new war"? If this danger exists, what steps should be taken to stop the war?

A: I do not believe in the real danger of a "new war." Those who are clamoring for a "new war" are mainly military and political intelligence operatives, and their colleagues from the civil service. They need this clamor in order to: a) frighten some naive politicians in the ranks of their political opponents with the illusion of war, and thereby help their own governments to obtain more concessions from their political opponents; b) slow down the reduction of their national military budgets for a period of time; c) halt the demobilization of the army, thereby curbing the rapid increase in unemployment in their own countries.

A strict distinction should be made between the clamor for a "new war" that is currently taking place and the real danger of a "new war" that does not exist.

Q: Do you believe that Britain and the United States are intentionally establishing a "capitalist encirclement" of the Soviet Union?

A: I do not believe that the rulers of Britain and the United States have established a "capitalist encirclement" of the Soviet Union, and even if they wanted to do so, I could not make a dogmatic statement on this.

Q: In the words of Wallace's recent speech, can Britain, Western Europe, and the United States be sure that the Soviet Union's policy in Germany will not become a tool for Russia's advance against Western Europe?

A: I believe that it is untenable to say that the Soviet Union is using Germany against Western Europe and the United States. I believe this is untenable not only because the Soviet Union, Britain, and France are linked by mutual assistance treaties against German aggression, and with Britain by the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, but also because a policy of using Germany against Western Europe and the United States would mean that the Soviet Union is deviating from its fundamental national interests.

Simply put, the Soviet Union's policy on the German question is to demilitarize and democratize Germany. I believe that the demilitarization and democratization of Germany is one of the most important guarantees for establishing a strong and lasting peace.

Q: Some criticize that the policies of the Communist Parties in Western European countries are in accordance with Moscow's instructions. What is your opinion on this?

A: I think this accusation is absurd and borrowed from the bankrupt Hitler-Goebbels arsenal.

Q: Although there are ideological differences, do you believe that friendship and long-term cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western European democracies is possible, and as Wallace said in his speech, is friendly competition between the two systems possible?

A: Absolutely believe it.

Q: During the stay of the British Labour Party delegation here, I understand that you expressed your conviction in the possibility of friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. The broad masses of the British people warmly hope for this kind of relationship. What methods can assist in the establishment of this relationship?

A: I certainly believe in the possibility of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Britain. Strengthening political, commercial, and cultural ties between the two countries can assist in the establishment of this relationship.

Q: Do you think that the most rapid withdrawal of all American troops from China is most necessary for future peace?

A: Yes, I think so.

Q: Do you believe that the United States' de facto monopoly possession of the atomic bomb is one of the main threats to peace?

A: I do not believe that the atomic bomb has such a serious power as some politicians do. The atomic bomb is used to frighten people with weak nerves, but it cannot determine the fate of war, because the atomic bomb is completely insufficient for this. Of course, monopolizing the secret of the atomic bomb creates a threat, but there are at least two ways to counter this threat: a) the monopoly possession of the atomic bomb will not continue for long; b) the use of the atomic bomb will be prohibited.

Q: Do you think that as the Soviet Union makes further progress towards communism, the possibility of peaceful cooperation with foreign countries will also decrease? Is it possible to build communism in one country?

A: I have no doubt that the possibility of peaceful cooperation will not only not decrease, but will increase; it is possible to build communism in one country, especially in a country like the Soviet Union.

　　斯大林答英记者问
    塔斯社原电
    【新华社延安十七日电】本社九月二十五日播发之斯大林答复英记者谈话，系录自莫斯科口语广播，兹获得塔斯社原电，特重播如下，以资订正。
    【塔斯社讯】英国《星期泰晤士报》驻莫斯科通讯员亚力山大·威斯，于一九四六年九月十七日用书面形式向斯大林元帅提出若干问题，此等问题有关目前政治形势和英美两国与苏联之关系。兹将威斯先生之问题与斯大林元帅之答复录志如下：
    问：关于“新战争”，现在全世界正进行着这样多的不负责任的谈论，你是否相信这“新战争”的实际危险性？假使这危险性存在的话，为了制止战争应该采取什么步骤？
    答：我并不相信“新战争”的实际危险性。现在叫嚣“新战争”的，主要是军事政治的情报工作者，以及来自民政官吏方面的他们的同道，他们需要这种叫嚣是为了：甲、用战争的幻影来恐吓他们政治对手行列中某些天真的政治家，并且借此来帮助他们自己的政府从政治对手手中获取更多的让步；乙、使他们本国军事预算的减缩迟缓一个时期；丙、停滞军队的复员，借此来制止他们本国失业的迅速增加。
    应该严格地分别现在所进行着的“新战争”的叫嚣，和现在并不存在着的“新战争”的实际危险性。
    问：你是否认为英国和美国有意地对苏联建立“资本主义的包围”？
    答：我并不以为英国和美国的统治者曾对苏联建立“资本主义的包围”，甚至于假使他们要这样做，我也不能对此加以武断。
    问：用华莱士最近一次演说的话来说，英国、西欧、美国能否确信苏联在德国的政策会变成俄国对西欧突进的工具？
    答：我认为苏联利用德国以反对西欧和美国是不成立的，这个所以不成立，我认为不仅是因为苏联和英国与法国有反对德国侵略的互助条约联系着，和英国则有波茨顿三强会议的决定联系着，并且还因为利用德国反对西欧和美国的政策就是表明苏联脱离它基本的民族利益。
    简单地说，苏联对于德国问题的政策是使德国非军事化和民主化，我以为德国的非军事化和民主化是建立强固与长久和平的最重要的保障之一。
    问：有人责难说西欧各国共产党的政策是依照莫斯科的指使，你对此意见如何？
    答：这责难我认为是荒谬的，是从已经破产了的希特勒——戈培尔兵工厂里借用来的。
    问：虽然存在着意识形态的不同，你是否相信苏联和西欧的民主有友谊和长期合作的可能，正如华莱士演说中所说两个体系之间是否有友好竞赛的可能？
    答：绝对相信。
    问：在英国工党代表团逗留这里的时候，据我了解，你曾表示确信英国与苏联友谊关系的可能性，英国广大人民群众热烈地希望着此种关系。有何方法，可协助此项关系的建立？
    答：我确实相信苏联与英国友谊关系的可能性，加强两国间政治商业与文化的连系，当可协助此种关系的建立。
    问：你是否认为最迅速地从中国撤退所有美军是对于未来和平最必要的？
    答：是的，我认为是。
    问：你是否认为美国实际上独占地占有原子弹是对于和平的主要威胁之一？
    答：我并不像某些政治家那样，认为原子弹有这样严重的力量，原子弹是用来恐吓神经软弱的人的，但是它并不能决定战争的命运，因为对于这一点，原子弹是完全不够的。当然，独占地占有原子弹的秘密会造成一种威胁，但是至少也存在着两种方法反对这威胁：甲、独占地占有原子弹，不会继续得长久；乙、使用原子弹将被禁止。
    问：你是否以为随着苏联向共产主义更进一步的进展，苏联对外和平合作的可能性也会减少？一国可能建立共产主义吗？
    答：我毫不怀疑和平合作的可能，非但不会减少，并且会增加；在一国建立其共产主义是可能的，特别是在像苏联这样的国家里。
