　　Song of the Chiang Kai-shek Soldiers
    Collected by Yan Ling
    We became soldiers,
    Originally forced into service by the Baochang!
    Barging into the house in the dead of night, kerplunk,
    Kneeling and begging was no use,
    By dawn we were in the new recruit camp,
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    We became soldiers,
    A large group tied together by a rope.
    We sleep together, pee together, and defecate together!
    Lie down together and not allowed to move,
    Whoever dares to move gets "American peanuts"!
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    We became soldiers,
    Every day we suffer hunger and cold.
    In the dead of winter, we wear thin clothes full of patches,
    Patched knees and rotten backs,
    Two big eyes on our butts!
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    We became soldiers,
    Turns out old Chiang wants conscripts,
    Haven't seen a Japanese shadow in seven or eight years,
    The Eighth Route Army drove away the Japanese devils,
    Now we're fighting the Eighth Route Army again,
    We really can't figure out this reasoning!
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    We became soldiers,
    Charging with American weapons in hand.
    Heard that old Chiang made an agreement with the Americans,
    Selling out all of China's sovereignty,
    America will help him sit on the throne.
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    Old Chiang gave the order,
    To launch a joint offensive against the border of the Liberated Areas.
    Cannons booming, planes buzzing in the sky,
    Machine guns are pointed at our backs,
    You can't get away with not fighting for him!
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    Just as we launched the offensive,
    We immediately ran into a big iron nail!
    The Eighth Route Army fights fiercely,
    Our division commander was captured alive,
    Brothers entered the city of wrongful death!
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

    Want to run but can't,
    Let's just fire our bullets into the sky!
    Turn the guns around and disobey old Chiang's reckless orders!
    If we want to go home early,
    We can only oppose the war and seek peace!
    One—two—three—four! One two three—four!

　　蒋军士兵之歌
    燕凌辑录
    俺们来当兵，
    原来是保长逼壮丁！
    半夜三更打进屋门咕里咕咚，
    跪下求饶没有用，
    天明就进了新兵营，
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    俺们来当兵，
    一大群拴着一条绳。
    一齐睡觉一齐撒尿、一齐出恭！
    一齐躺下不许动，
    谁敢动就吃“洋花生”！
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    俺们来当兵，
    每天里受饥又挨冷。
    十冬腊月穿的单衣满身补绽，
    补了膝盖烂脊梁，
    屁股上两只大眼睛！
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    俺们来当兵，
    原来是老蒋要壮丁，
    七八年来没有见过日本人影，
    八路打走日本鬼，
    如今又来打八路，
    这道理咱真想不通！
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    俺们来当兵，
    手拿着美国武器冲。
    听说老蒋跟美国人订了协定，
    中国主权都卖净，
    美国就帮他坐朝廷。
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    老蒋下了令，
    向解放区边境齐进攻。
    大炮轰轰飞机嗡嗡响在半空，
    背后架着机关枪，
    你不给他干算不中！
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    刚刚一进攻，
    一下子碰个大铁钉！
    八路军打起仗来真是凶，
    俺们师长被活捉，
    弟兄们进了枉死城！
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
　
    想跑跑不成，
    咱就把子弹朝天迸！
    倒转枪口对准老蒋不听乱命！
    想要早点回家转，
    咱只有反战求和平！
    一——二——三——四！一二三——四！
