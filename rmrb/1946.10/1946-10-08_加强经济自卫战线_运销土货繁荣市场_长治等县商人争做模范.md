　　Strengthen the Economic Self-Defense Front
　　Transport and Sell Local Products to Prosper the Market
　　Merchants in Changzhi and Other Counties Strive to Become Models
　　[This newspaper Changzhi news] Merchants in Changzhi, Zuoquan, Lucheng and other counties, with extreme hatred for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries, unanimously responded to the "August 15th" call of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau, and launched a movement to strengthen the economic front in the patriotic self-defense war. This movement unfolded from the current affairs study movement. The Changzhi City Federation of Industry and Commerce organized a study work team on the 4th of this month, dividing into six groups to conduct intensive study of current affairs in various streets. In a meeting and discussion, 72 private and public stores on West Street expressed extreme indignation and hatred for Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and the encroachment of American goods in large quantities. The manager of Dazhong Goods Depot said angrily: "Chiang Kai-shek is willing to be a running dog of American imperialism and destroy China's national industry. This is so hateful." The manager of Kangtai Wang said: "We listen to the government's words and resolutely do not sell foreign goods." Li Gang, the manager of Huaxing Company, said: "As long as we run our factories well and make our goods strong and beautiful, the people will welcome them, and we will also make money. As long as we don't sell foreign goods, they won't come in by themselves." Everyone agreed that only by developing industry and facing the countryside can we make a permanent fortune. They unanimously expressed their desire to be model merchants serving the people. After 20 days of study, Zuoquan merchants overcame their privileged thinking and criticized examples of speculation and hoarding. After exchanging experiences, they unanimously felt that only by grasping seasonality, preparing seasonal goods, buying and selling as needed, and making small profits through retail, can they both facilitate the masses and attract customers, and inevitably make a fortune. In terms of direction, they also clarified the basic spirit of serving industry and agriculture, and resolved to develop trade in local products and resist foreign goods, so as to enhance the economic front of the patriotic self-defense war. After studying, the merchants of Lucheng realized the correct path of business operation: 1. Establish the new merchant concept of serving the broad masses, and play the role of adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, stabilizing prices, prospering the market, and building the countryside. 2. Transport and sell more, and operate with small profits. 3. Transport and sell local products and resist foreign goods. 4. Unite in friendship, help each other and benefit each other. Finally, everyone launched a new heroism movement competition, all striving to become model new merchants and economic fighters in the self-defense war.

　　加强经济自卫战线
    运销土货繁荣市场
    长治等县商人争做模范
    【本报长治讯】长治左权潞城等县商人怀着对卖国头子蒋介石与美国反动派的极度憎恶，一致响应中共晋冀鲁豫中央局“八一五”号召，掀起加强爱国自卫战争中经济战线的运动。这一运动是从时事学习运动展开的。长治市商联会于本月四日曾组织了学习工作队，分六个小组到各街突击学习时事。西街公私商店七十二家在集会讨论中，对蒋介石卖国丧权使美货大批侵入，均表示极度愤慨与憎恶。大众货栈经理愤恨的说：“蒋介石甘心给美帝国主义当走狗，把中国民族工业摧垮，这是多么可恨的事”。抗太王经理说：“我们听到政府的话，坚决不卖外货”。华兴号经理李纲说：“咱们只要把咱工厂办好，把货做的结实漂亮，老百姓欢迎买，咱也赚钱。咱只要不贩卖外货，他不会自己走进来的”。大家一致认为只有发展工业，面向农村，才会永久发财。一致表示要作为人民服务的模范商人。左权商人经过二十天的学习，公营商店克服了特权思想，并把投机取巧囤集居奇的实例作了批判。经过经验交流，一致感到只有掌握了季节性，准备应时商品，随买随卖，薄利零销，既便利群众又能招揽顾客，必然发财。在方向上也明确了为工农业服务的基本精神，决心发展土货贸易，抵制外货，以增强爱国自卫战争的经济战线。潞城商人学习后，认识了商业经营的正确路线：一、树立为广大群众服务的新商人观念，发挥调剂有无，平稳物价，繁荣市场，建设农村的作用。二、多运多销，薄利经营。三、运销土货，抵制外货。四、团结友爱，互助互利。最后大家展开新英雄主义运动竞赛，都要为争取模范新商人，争取成为自卫战中的经济战士而奋斗。
