Xinhua News Agency, Northern Jireliao Front, 17th: General Duan Suquan led his troops in a night attack on Jianchang (i.e., Lingnan) County in southern Rehe Province on the 14th. After fierce fighting until 8 PM the following day, in over 20 hours of continuous combat, they completely annihilated two regiments of the Northeast Security 4th Detachment, totaling over 1,000 men, and captured alive the detachment's deputy commander, Luo Guangxing, the county magistrate of the county, Rui Bihai, and others. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.

Xinhua News Agency, Southern Jireliao Front, 17th: Ninghe County, located 60 kilometers northeast of Tianjin near the Beining Railway, was recovered by the Eighth Route Army on the 5th, annihilating over 100 enemies. Detailed battle results are still being investigated. Note: The city was forcibly occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on September 13th.

Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 12th: (Delayed) For the past ten days, the Eastern Hebei Eighth Route Army has launched a fierce counterattack in self-defense in a vast area stretching from Lulong and Luan County in the east to Xianghe and Ji County in the west, annihilating 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. The Chiang Kai-shek troops besieged in the isolated city of Leting have abandoned the city and fled. The Chiang Kai-shek reinforcement forces on the Leizhuang to Luan County section have also been completely defeated. Chiang Kai-shek's battle lines are extended, his forces are insufficient, and his predicament of being beaten everywhere is fully exposed. On the 7th of this month, a unit of the Eighth Route Army launched an attack on the Chiang Kai-shek puppet stronghold of Shitizi, 80 miles southwest of Lulong. After fierce fighting until 10:00 AM on the 8th, at the cost of 150 casualties, they achieved a great victory by completely annihilating over 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. In this battle, they captured the four strongholds of Shitizi, Baidianzi, Qiansuoying, and Yujiahe, destroyed 11 bunkers, killed or wounded the captain and deputy captain of the 1st and 2nd security team of the Chiang Kai-shek side, and over 300 officers and soldiers below the company commander of the 470th regiment of the 62nd Army. They wounded Guo Yusheng, the deputy battalion commander of the 1st battalion of the 1st column of the Security Team, and over 100 others. They captured over 650 people, including Cao Qinglun, the magistrate of Lulong County, Dong Huaijun, the deputy captain of the police brigade, Wang Huanzhang, the captain of the brigade, Cheng Ruojin, the captain of the conscripted combined force, Bai Wenbo, the secretary of the 1st District Party Committee. They seized two 82mm mortars, over 680 rifles and carbines, 48 short guns, 5 machine guns, 2 American-style submachine guns, 7 grenade launchers, and countless ammunition. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet strongholds of Wangjiashan and Fenghuangshan northwest of Luan County were also attacked by a unit of the Eighth Route Army on the night of the 4th. They captured five bunkers that night and inflicted heavy casualties on a battalion of the 470th Regiment of the 12th Division of the 16th Army of Chiang Kai-shek, which was reinforcing from Leizhuang. On the 8th, a unit of the Eighth Route Army counterattacked the Chiang Kai-shek puppet security team in Macheng, south of Luan County, destroying three bunkers and killing over 40 people. The 2nd Battalion of the 13th Regiment of the 62nd Division of Chiang Kai-shek, and personnel from Chiang Kai-shek's county government, who were besieged in Leting, abandoned the city on the 9th and fled north to Luan County. As of now, in the Luanhe Estuary triangle area south and east of Luan County, except for the isolated stronghold of Macheng which is still under siege, dozens of occupied villages and towns, and the county seat, have all returned to the hands of the Eighth Route Army. In the Xianghe area on the western front, a unit of the Eighth Route Army captured the Chiang Kai-shek puppet stronghold of Qukou Town east of Xianghe in one fell swoop on the 8th, killing, wounding, and capturing over 100 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and seizing 25 rifles. A unit of the 56th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army, which was reinforcing Qukou from Xianghe, was also ambushed by the Eighth Route Army, suffering more than 40 casualties.
