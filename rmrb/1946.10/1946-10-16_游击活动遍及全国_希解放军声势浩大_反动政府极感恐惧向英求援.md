　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th. Comprehensive dispatches: The momentum of the Greek National Liberation Army is growing. According to Agence France-Presse: "Guerrilla activities are now spreading throughout Greece." A Reuters dispatch from Greece also stated: "The Liberation Army not only occupies the mountains but also controls some small cities." According to Greek newspapers, the Greek reactionary government's punitive operations against the National Liberation Army and peaceful villagers have caused dissatisfaction among its troops, and this dissatisfaction has reached the point where the entire troop refuses to carry out the orders of the command. On September 30th, 72 officers and soldiers were executed or imprisoned for "disobeying orders." The Greek reactionary government is very afraid of the above situation. According to Agence France-Presse and Reuters, the Greek government submitted a proposal last weekend to establish local security forces (i.e., armed veterans and royalists in the countryside) to expand the civil war and requested Britain to equip the forces with weapons. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 9th, the British government has agreed to Greece establishing "local forces" and has, in principle, resolved to supply light weapons. According to Reuters: "This has aroused sharp opposition from politically minded people in London." According to another Reuters dispatch, British Communist MP Piratin asked in the House of Commons on the 8th about the date of the British troops' withdrawal from Greece. Undersecretary Mayhew replied: "The recent outbreak of chaos in Greece, especially in the northern region, makes it impossible to make any decision at this time."

    【新华社延安十三日电】综合各方电讯：希腊民族解放军声势日益浩大，据法新闻处讯：“游击活动已有遍及希腊全国之势”。路透社希腊消息亦说：“解放军不仅在山中盘据，而且占有若干小城市”。据希腊报纸报导，希反动政府下令其军队对民族解放军及和平乡村居民的讨伐作战，已在其部队间造成不满，这种不满情绪，已达到整个部队拒绝执行指挥部命令的程度，九月三十日，就有七十二名官兵因“违抗命令”的罪名被处死刑或徒刑。希反动政府对以上情势非常惧怕，据法新闻处及路透社称：希政府已于上周末提出建立地方保安部队（按即武装乡村里的在乡军人及保皇党人），以扩大内战，并要求英国以武器装备该部队。据法新闻处九日讯：英政府已同意希腊建立“地方部队”，并在原则上决议供给轻武器，据路透社称：“这已引起伦敦有政治头脑人士的尖锐反对。”又据路透社讯：英共议员皮拉丁八日于下院质问英军从希腊撤退日期，外次麦休答称：“最近希腊混乱之爆发，特别在北部地区，使目前做出任何决定成为不可能。”
