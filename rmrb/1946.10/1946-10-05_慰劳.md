The news of the great victory at Guanque (meaning the annihilation of Hu Zongnan's First Division) reached Fushan × Village, and the whole village was immediately stirred up. Men, women, and children voluntarily sent comfort goods to the village office. Someone carrying a hen that was laying eggs said to the village chief, "This is my comfort for our people." After saying that, she happily put down the hen and left. At this time, sitting diagonally opposite the village office were several prisoners of war captured in the Guanque battle. They stared with surprised eyes and asked an old lady, "What is this for?" The old lady smiled and said, "Comfort!" She didn't see clearly that they were prisoners, and enthusiastically said, "You've worked hard fighting!" The faces of several prisoners immediately turned red, and they murmured something incomprehensible.

At this moment, the stretcher carrying a soldier who was bravely wounded in the Guanque battle arrived, and the whole village suddenly became tense. Women and children, as if in a race, rushed to the village office with comfort goods. An old lady surnamed Gao ran too fast and left her six-year-old child behind. The child, holding two crabapples, chased after her, crying and shouting, "Mommy... wait... for... me... fruit... fruit...!"

The women all surrounded the wounded soldier, but there were still people outside shouting, "Make way! Make way!" This was Chen Si's wife. She was cooking noodles when she suddenly heard that the wounded soldier had arrived. She threw down the noodles cooking in the pot and ran out with a plate of scrambled eggs with oil. She shouted and squeezed, rushing into the crowd with all her might. The women carefully touched the wounds of the injured soldiers, asking them with concern about their well-being; the women who gave the wounded sugar water to drink were like loving mothers feeding their children, afraid of burning their mouths. Chen Si's wife saw the wounded soldier take her scrambled eggs and was so happy that she beamed, personally putting them into the wounded soldier's mouth.

A prisoner named Zhang Jinguixiang suddenly couldn't help but say, "It's so good!..." But before he could finish his words, tears streamed down his face. Another one named Chen Faxiang also said with red eyes:

"I've never seen anything like this in my life! The people treat the army like parents love their sons, wives love their husbands."

He said, "Speaking of fighting in the Central Army, huh! Don't even mention comfort, if you get hurt and someone carries you, you're lucky! You know, you can't even hire people over there, no matter how much money you have!" At this moment, Zhang Jinguixiang, who had just shed tears of emotion, suddenly stretched his neck and leaned in to say to everyone, "If one day we could also receive such comfort..." His voice was very low, but it was heard by a woman next to him who was giving sugar water to the wounded soldier, who interrupted him and said, "As long as you participate in opposing the civil war, the people, big and small, will support you. Comfort, what does that even count for? There are even better comforts than this!"

"Really?" The prisoners opened their envious eyes and smiled.

　　慰劳
    古维进
    官雀大胜利（即歼灭胡宗南第一师之后）的消息传到浮山×村，全村立即骚动了，男女老少自动往村公所送慰劳品。有人提着正在下蛋的母鸡对村长说：“这是我慰劳咱们人的。”说完她就笑嬉嬉的放下母鸡走了。这时村公所斜对面坐着，官雀战斗中被俘的几个俘虏，瞪着诧异的眼，问一个老太太：“这是干什么的？”老太太笑着说：“慰劳呀！”她没看清楚他们是俘虏，又热忱的说：“你们打仗辛苦啦！”几个俘虏的脸孔马上红了，嘴里喃喃地不知说些什么。
    这时官雀战斗中英勇负伤的战士的担架下来了，全村骤然紧张起来，妇女儿童像竞赛一样，争先恐后的端着慰劳品跑向村公所。有一个姓高的老太太跑得太快了，把六岁的小孩丢在后面。小孩手里拿着两个沙果，连喊带哭的追着：“娘娘………等………我………果子………果子………！”
    女人们都把彩号围起来，但外面还有人在叫着：“让开！让开！”这是陈四嫂，她正在做面忽然听到彩号过来了，就扔下煮在锅里的面条，端着一盘油炒鸡蛋往外跑。她嚷着挤着，一股劲往人堆里冲。妇女们都小心翼翼的摸着伤员的伤口，向伤员们问暖问冷；给伤员喝糖水的妇女，像慈母喂孩子似的生怕烧了伤员的嘴。陈四嫂看见伤员接过自己的炒鸡蛋，高兴得眉开眼笑，亲自送进伤员的嘴里。
    一个叫张金贵的俘虏，忽然情不自禁的说：“真好呀！………”可是话没有说完，他的眼泪流下来了。那个叫陈发祥的也红着眼说：
    “我长了这么大，从来就没有见过！老百姓对待军队好比父母痛爱儿子，妻子痛爱丈夫。”
    他说：“说起在中央军打仗，哼！不要说慰劳，挂彩有人抬就算福气！你知道那边有钱都雇不上老百姓呀！”这时刚才因感动而流泪的张金贵忽然伸长脖子，凑近大家说：“有一天如果咱们也能受子到这样的慰劳……”他的声音很低，但是被旁边一个给伤员喝糖水的妇女听到了，便打断他的话说：“只要参加反对内战，老百姓大大小小都拥护。慰劳，这还算个甚，比这好的慰劳还多着呢！”
    “是吗？”俘虏们睁大羡慕的眼睛，笑起来了。
