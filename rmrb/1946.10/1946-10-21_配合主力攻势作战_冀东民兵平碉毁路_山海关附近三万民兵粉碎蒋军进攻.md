Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Front, 17th: In the victorious battles of the powerful offensive operations by the Eighth Route Army on the North China Railway, recovering more than ten towns including Leting, Macheng, and Shimenzi (the location of the Jiang-controlled Lulong County government southwest of Lulong), the Jidong militia closely coordinated with the regular army in combat. The Chiang army garrisoned at @zitou Station, more than forty miles west of Luan County on the North China Railway, could not withstand the militia's siege and fled in disarray. Consequently, the fortifications and other works there were completely flattened by the nearby militia. The Changcheng Coal Mine northwest of Shanhaiguan and its affiliated railway to the North China Railway were also thoroughly destroyed by more than 30,000 militia. This line was a vital transportation route used by the Chiang army to transport troops to the Changcheng line when they launched a large-scale invasion of the Jidong Liberated Area at the end of August. Fearing the prestige of the militia, the Chiang army hastily transferred more than 1,000 men from the 93rd Army's Provisional 20th Division, which had been dispatched to the Northeast, to cooperate with local puppet troops in attacking along the railway in mid-last month, while covering the repair of the roadbed. The militia combat teams bravely defended the mountain positions along the thirty-mile-long Beihua River area for three days and nights, repeatedly using landmines and rifles to resist and inflict casualties on the invading army. By the 20th of last month, they had completely shattered the Chiang army's (mopping-up) conspiracy. During this period, the militia also intercepted a train of Chiang army soldiers. Chiang troops harassing Anmin and other places were defeated. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 60 Chiang soldiers were annihilated, and part of their American-style firearms equipment was seized.

    冀东民兵平碉毁路
    山海关附近三万民兵粉碎蒋军进攻
    【新华社冀热辽前线十七日电】在北宁路南北八路军强大攻势作战，恢复乐亭、马城、石棉子（卢龙西南蒋方卢龙县府所在地）等十余城镇的胜利战役中，冀东民兵密切配合正规军作战，踞守北宁路滦县西四十余里＠子头车站的蒋军抵挡不住民兵的围困。狼狈窜逃，该地堡垒工事等遂为附近民兵全部平毁。山海关西北长城煤矿及其附设通北宁路的铁道，亦为三万余民兵彻底破坏，该线为八月底蒋军大举进犯冀东解放区时运兵至长城一线之交通要道。蒋军慑于民兵声威，乃于上月中旬急速抽调派赴东北的九十三军暂编二十师一千余众配合当地伪军沿铁路出犯，一面掩护抢修路基。民兵参战队英勇扼守北花河一带三十余里长的山头阵地凡三昼夜，迭以地雷步枪抗击杀伤进犯军，至上月二十日，已将蒋军（扫荡）阴谋彻底粉碎。在此期间，民兵并截击蒋军兵车一列。安民等地出扰蒋军均被击溃，据不完全统计，共歼灭蒋军六十余，缴美式枪械装备一部。
