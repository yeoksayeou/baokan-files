　　International Gleanings
    The Ugly Performance of Chiang's Representatives at the Paris Peace Conference
    A reporter from *Ta Kung Pao* said that the Kuomintang delegation attending the peace conference was "too inactive." Representatives from other countries frequently held press conferences to express their views on the conference issues; however, China never held any. Many foreign reporters requested to speak with the Chinese delegation, not wanting to know the Kuomintang's policy on the peace conference, but rather wanting to know about the situation of the Chinese civil war, but they did not achieve their goal.
    A reporter from *Peace Daily* said: The Paris newspapers constantly publish news that is extremely unpleasant and easily subject to international criticism, and Chinese people at the conference venue are often embarrassed.
    The only proposal made by the Kuomintang delegation at this peace conference was to allow the former Italian colony of Libya to become independent. The Kuomintang's newspapers made a big fuss about this. However, the day before the Italian Political Committee was to vote on this amendment (September 24), Guo Taiqi (acting head of the delegation) suddenly stated that this proposal was difficult to support and would be "automatically" withdrawn to avoid being defeated by a vote of nineteen to one.
    On August 17, when Wang Shijie was chairing the plenary session and the conference was discussing whether Austria should present its views to the conference, Wang asked the representatives of each country to raise their hands to vote. After he counted the votes in favor, it is said that because he "could not see clearly" the number of votes against, he asked those representatives who voted against to stand up. This is a method commonly used in meetings organized by Chiang Kai-shek, but it has never been seen in international conferences. Molotov and the representatives of Poland and Yugoslavia (those who voted against) were greatly surprised by this method of counting votes; Molotov remained seated, showing displeasure; in this emergency, the Ukrainian representative suggested using a roll call to re-record the votes, and the problem was solved.
    Paris newspapers are not very familiar with Wang Shijie. *World Evening News* published an article introducing Wang, but the attached photo was of Wang Zhengzhu.

    巴黎和会上蒋家代表丑态
    大公报的记者说，出席和会的国民党代表团“太不活跃”，别国的代表时常举行记者招待会，发表关于和会问题的见解；但中国却始终没有举行过。有许多外国记者要求和中国代表团谈话，他们并不想知道国民党对和会的政策，而是想知道中国内战情形，但他们没有达到目的。
    和平日报记者说：巴黎各报都不断登载着使人极不愉快而又易受到国际批评的消息，凡在会场的中国人都常常受窘。
    国民党代表团在这次和会上仅有的一项提案是准许前意属殖民地利比亚独立，国民党的报纸为此曾大作文章，而在意大利政治委员会要表决这修正案的前天（九月二十四日），郭泰祺（代理团长）忽然表示这提案很难受人支持，将“自动”撤回，免得以十九票对一票被否决。
    八月十七日，王世杰担任全会主席，大会讨论奥国是否应向和会陈述意见时，王请各国代表举手表决，当他数好了赞成票，据说因为“看不清楚”反对的票数，于是请那些投反对票的代表们站起来。这是蒋介石所组会议惯用的方法，国际会议上却未曾见过。莫洛托夫与波、南代表们（投反对票者）对于这种检票方法大为惊奇；莫洛托夫坐着不动，显出不高兴的样子；在这紧急关头，乌克兰代表建议用点名的方法重新纪录，问题才解决。
    巴黎报纸对于王世杰不大熟悉，世界晚报曾登载一篇介绍王的文章，附上的照片却是用的王正柱。
