[This report from the JiluYu Frontline on the 24th] The Eighth Route Army, which has transferred to the suburbs of Juye, has launched counterattacks against the American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army and 11th Division for several days, annihilating another 1,000 Chiang soldiers. Our powerful troops advancing behind enemy lines, in coordination with local militias, suddenly appeared in Panjiazhuang and Lijialou, south of Juye city, on the 18th. The Chiang soldiers were caught off guard, with over 500 killed or wounded. On the 19th, more than 100 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded in Majiazhuang and Zoujiazhuang, more than ten miles west of Juye city. On the same night, we blew up the bridge three miles northwest of Juye city, luring the enemy out of the city, killing or wounding over 350 of them. In the battles of Lianlongji and Zhangfengji, these two armies have already suffered losses of 6,000. According to captured Chiang soldiers, morale within the army has been very low since suffering continuous and severe blows, and war-weariness has greatly increased.

[This report from JiluYu on the 24th] The Eighth Route Army on the JiluYu front actively withdrew to the suburbs of Juye and Jiaxiang and advanced behind enemy lines to continue annihilating the invading army. The American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army and 11th Division, advancing east along the Heze-Juye road, suffered repeated heavy blows, with a total of over 5,000 men annihilated. They were then surrounded by the Eighth Route Army on the south bank of the Zhu River, in a precarious situation. Gu Zhutong and Xue Yue then rushed to dispatch the 75th Army as reinforcements, and launched another invasion on the 15th. After inflicting heavy casualties on the invading army, the Eighth Route Army actively withdrew from Juye and Jiaxiang cities and turned to favorable positions to annihilate the enemy, and sent powerful troops to advance behind enemy lines. On the 16th, they ambushed in Huangzhenji, east of Heze, capturing two vehicles and destroying one.

[This report from Jinnan on the 23rd] Chiang and puppet troops in northern Henan fiercely attacked Huilongji in Anyang, attempting to invade Daming city again, but were repelled by the Eighth Route Army and the militia. On the 12th of this month, the 381st Regiment of the 106th Brigade of Chiang's 40th Army, in coordination with about 4,000 men from the puppet Cheng Daosheng, Guo Qing, and Wang Ziquan, carrying ten flat-fire guns, small mountain guns, and mortars, and over a hundred light and heavy machine guns, fiercely attacked our Huilongji in Anyang, attempting to occupy the area and then invade Daming city. Along the way, they tied up the masses, plundered property, raped and killed, and committed all kinds of evil. Our local garrison, in close cooperation with the militia and guerrillas, fought back bravely. After three days of fierce fighting, the Chiang and puppet troops fled in panic back to the vicinity of Taibaoliulin. In a pursuit battle in Doubaoying, four platoons of one of our regiments captured four rifles, one pistol, two warhorses, captured four Chiang soldiers alive, and killed more than twenty. Currently, the Chiang and puppet troops are deploying troops and generals, with a great momentum to invade Huilong again, and our army and people are also actively preparing to give the invaders an even greater blow.

[Another Dispatch] The remnants of puppet bandits in the Gaotang area of Jinnan are stirring, and our local army corps is victoriously attacking. The remnants of the puppet bandit Deng Xieshen's troops in the Gaotang area have recently reorganized their forces and gathered in the Sanguanmiao and Yangguantun areas of the second and third districts, constantly attacking villages near the county seat such as Balizhuang and Qianhou Guozhuang, attempting to recapture the county seat. At dawn on the 20th, a certain regiment of our Jinnan People's Liberation Army counterattacked the puppet bandits who invaded and occupied Kangzhuang. After three hours of fighting, the puppet bandits fled in panic. We pursued them for ten miles, killing or wounding more than 50 enemies, capturing 44 alive, and seizing one light machine gun and more than 40 rifles. We only sacrificed two men. Our army is still continuing the pursuit.

[This report from the front on the 22nd] Following the large-scale sabotage war against the Pinghan Railway on the night of the 16th, the Eighth Route Army in northern Henan took advantage of the victory and captured Yigou Town and Yigou Station on the 17th. The total results of the two days of the 16th and 17th are as follows: All large and small Chiang and puppet strongholds along the railway line between Tangyin and Yigou, including Changsha, Dongdai, Maxiakou, Xiaoguang, Guojiayao, Pangjiaao, Wujiaao, and Jizhenzhuang, were captured, and more than 40 bunkers were completely destroyed. Thirty miles of railway line were also completely destroyed, and six railway bridges were blown up, one of which was the second largest railway bridge between Xinxiang and Anyang. The two battalions of the puppet Tangyin security regiment under Hu Quanlu were completely wiped out, capturing more than 100 men including two company commanders and below, and seizing three machine guns and more than 100 rifles.
