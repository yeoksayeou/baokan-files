　　Commentary on Truman's Speech
    *Liberation Daily* Commentary

    In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on the 23rd, U.S. President Truman mentioned the Four Freedoms championed by President Roosevelt: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Mr. Truman also mentioned that "every member of the United Nations must not threaten or use force to violate the territorial integrity or political independence of any country." If Truman truly acted according to his words, the U.S. government would not be the object of opposition all over the world as it is today. However, Truman's words and the actual actions of the Truman administration have never been consistent. Didn't Truman also make a very nice statement last December? But isn't the U.S. authorities' policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war and armed intervention in China's internal affairs completely contrary to the December statement!

    Truman's talk of the Four Freedoms makes us think that today it is the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government that is destroying the Four Freedoms of the Chinese people, and it is the Truman government itself that is assisting the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government in destroying the Four Freedoms of the Chinese people. What is particularly worth pointing out is that Chiang Kai-shek is not only destroying the Four Freedoms of the Chinese people, but is also carrying out an unprecedented large-scale massacre—the civil war—against the Chinese people. And today's civil war of Chiang Kai-shek could not have been launched without the assistance of the U.S. government.

    U.S. troops are still stationed in China to this day, arbitrarily forcing purchases, robbing, and arbitrarily beating and killing people every day, insulting and raping our women. Isn't this clearly "threatening or using force to undermine" China's "territorial integrity and political independence"!

    Truman made a set of nice-sounding remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, which reflects the enormous pressure that the worldwide peace and democracy movement and the United States has placed on the Truman administration. We hope that the American people will work harder to stop the U.S. government from violating the spirit of the Roosevelt tradition by helping Chiang Kai-shek to destroy the Four Freedoms of the Chinese people, immediately withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China, and stop all aid to Chiang Kai-shek.

### 评杜鲁门演说  解放日报时评

　　评杜鲁门演说
    解放日报时评
    美总统杜鲁门二十三日在联合国大会上发表演说时，提到了罗斯福总统所标榜的四大自由，即言论自由、宗教信仰自由、免于贫困的自由以及免于恐怖的自由。杜氏也提到了“联合国每一会员国必不可威胁或运用武力以破坏任何一国的领土完整或政治独立”。如果杜鲁门真是照他的话行事，美国政府就不会像今天这样在全世界到处成为反对的对象了。可是，杜鲁门的说话和杜鲁门政府的实际行动从来并不一致。去年十二月杜鲁门声明不是也说得很好听吗？但是，美国当局援蒋内战武装干涉中国内政的政策不是和十二月声明完全背道而驰吗！
    杜鲁门谈到四大自由，使我们不能不想到今天摧残中国人民的四大自由的正是蒋介石独裁政府，而援助蒋介石独裁政府摧残中国人民的四大自由的正是杜鲁门政府自己。尤其是值得指出的，蒋介石不仅摧残中国人民的四大自由，而且正在向中国人民进行空前规模的大屠杀——内战。而今天蒋介石的内战，如果没有美国政府的援助是发动不起来的。
    美国军队一直到现在还驻在中国，天天随意强购、抢劫、任意打人杀人，侮辱和强奸我国妇女。这不是明明白白是“威胁或运用武力破坏”中国的“领土完整和政治独立”吗！
    杜鲁门在联合国大会说了一套好听的话，这反映了全世界与美国的和平民主运动给了杜鲁门政府以巨大的压力。我们希望美国人民更加努力，制止美政府违反罗斯福传统精神帮助蒋介石摧残中国人民四大自由的政策，立即撤退驻华美军，并停止对蒋介石的一切援助。
