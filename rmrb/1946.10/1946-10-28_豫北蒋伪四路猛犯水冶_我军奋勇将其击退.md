　　Northern Henan Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Troops Violently Attack Shuiye
    Our Army Fought Bravely to Repel Them
    [This Newspaper, Military News on the 27th] More than 10,000 Chiang's troops of the 40th Army and puppet troops of Wang Zi-quan's entire force, under the cover of tanks, artillery, and aircraft, launched an attack on Shuiye, Anyang. After fierce counterattacks by our army on the 24th and 25th, they retreated in disarray back to Qugou and its eastern original defenses on the evening of the 25th. The Chiang and puppet troops suffered more than 800 casualties. We captured three machine guns and hundreds of rifles.
    [Special Dispatch from the Northern Henan Front of This Newspaper] The Chiang troops of the 40th Division in Anyang and Tangyin, in coordination with the puppet troops of Wang Zi-quan, launched a westward attack in several directions, attacking Shuiye and Hebi, attempting to seize the strategic points of Shuiye, Hebi, and the Liuhegou mining area, to coordinate with the Chiang and puppet forces east of the road in a roundabout northward attack along both sides of the Pinghan Railway. This has been resolutely blocked by the Eighth Route Army. The entire Chiang troops of the 40th Division in Anyang, in coordination with the puppet bandits of Wang Zi-quan, launched a four-pronged attack on Shuiye at 7:00 AM on the 24th. The northwest routes attacked Dongdaxing and Shangbaishu respectively, attempting to advance in a roundabout way, but were repelled. The southern route invaded Donggaoping via Mengzhuang, and then advanced towards Xigaoping, more than 20 miles southeast of Shuiye. Another route advanced to Guxian Village. These two routes of Chiang and puppet troops were also met with a strong counterattack by the defending troops and retreated in disarray. At 10:00 PM, the Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack on the eastern route enemy. At Yangjuan Village, southeast of Shuiye, an entire company of the 106th Regiment of the 40th Division was annihilated. Three machine guns were captured. More than 30 Chiang soldiers were captured alive. On the same day, a part of the Chiang troops in Tangyin violently attacked Hebi, advancing to a location more than 20 miles east of Hebi. They were met with resistance from the defending troops, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.
    [This Newspaper, Taihang, 25th] Chiang's troops in northern Henan have been frequently mobilized in recent days. The 85th Division, which invaded and occupied Jiaozuo City, was transferred from Wuzhi to Xinxiang on the 17th, and entered the Qixian area on the 19th, taking over the defense of Sun Dianying's puppet 3rd Column. Sun's troops then went to Anyang to take over the defense of the 40th Division. The 40th Division is currently concentrating in the northwestern area of Anyang, in coordination with the 10th Artillery Regiment and a tank company, with the appearance of invading our Shuiye and Liuhegou. Our military and civilians are standing by in full battle readiness. Li Ying's puppet Transportation Police Division in Huixian, with its 4th and 5th Regiments, invaded Fangshan and Zhaoyao from Xiaowangzhuang on the 21st, and invaded Gaozhuang on the 22nd (all are north of Huicheng). The town of Bopi (west of Huixian), which was invaded and occupied by Chiang's puppets on the 12th, was recaptured by our army on the 21st.
