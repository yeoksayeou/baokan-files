　　On the First Anniversary of the US Military's Stationing in China
    Zeng Yanxiu

    One year ago, a month and a half after the Japanese devils surrendered, American troops began landing in North China. From that day on, American imperialism blatantly armed and interfered in China's internal affairs. Over the past year, the US authorities have transported hundreds of thousands of troops for the Kuomintang to the front lines in Northeast China, North China, and Central China, engaging in a civil war against the Chinese people. They have supplied the Kuomintang with several times more military materials and equipment than during the war against Japan, and trained forty Kuomintang divisions—twice as many as during the war against Japan. US Marines and aircraft have frequently harassed the Liberated Areas. In addition, the US Military Advisory Group has participated in Chiang Kai-shek's war plans, carrying out its mission of "observing the effectiveness of training techniques on the battlefield, instructing them in the use and maintenance of equipment, and generally helping the Chinese (i.e., Chiang Kai-shek, who is waging a civil war) apply their acquired combat experience" (Wei Demai, March 9th this year). All of this constitutes the most fundamental reason for the outbreak and expansion of the Chinese civil war, leading to today's all-out civil war. Honest Americans have long felt this way. Last November, an American soldier said in the US military's "China Flag" newspaper in Shanghai: In China's civil war, the Americans have done everything, "leaving only the actual pulling of the trigger to the Kuomintang soldiers."

    Now the US military is prepared to be stationed in China for a long time. Peterson, Assistant Secretary of the US Army, and his entourage, who came to China last month to sign an agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek government to sell surplus US military supplies in the Western Pacific, flew to Peiping last month to arrange this matter. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reported that "this trip is related to the long-term stationing of US troops in China," and said that "the future Peiping will be the largest US military garrison area." This kind of outrageous invasion of Chinese sovereignty completely violates the spirit of the Sino-US New Treaty of the Roosevelt era in the spring of 1943. In that treaty, the US government, led by Roosevelt, declared that it would abandon all the privileges it had enjoyed in China in the past due to unequal treaties, including the right to station troops. It is absolutely necessary to recall the history of US military presence in China. As the world knows, the United States' right to station troops in China, like other imperialists, originated from the Boxer Protocol after the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied Beijing in 1900. Since then, the United States has maintained a naval presence and Marines in China. These troops left China only during one period, that is, the most difficult period of China's War of Resistance Against Japan from 1939 to 1945. In 1939, the Japanese devils launched an anti-British and anti-American movement in the occupied areas of China in order to achieve their conspiracy to oppress Britain and the United States and force the Kuomintang authorities to accept the Eastern Munich. At that time, the United States accepted the demands of the Japanese devils and successively withdrew US troops from China until the US military re-landed in China last year. This is also well known. Of course, the US military's withdrawal from China during this period was by no means to respect China's sovereignty, but only a concession to and encouragement of the Japanese devils' aggression. After the US military turned to the counter-offensive in the Pacific, the Chinese people hoped that the US military would land in China to cooperate with the Chinese people in fighting side by side. However, this American army, which had been stationed in China for decades, did not land during this period. Wei Demai revealed this extremely important fact in Washington on October 22 last year. He said: "It should be explained that the United States has never had ground combat troops in China, and has never planned to send such troops to China... Our plan was a large-scale attack on the Japanese mainland, and the United States could not spare combat troops to send to China." Therefore, the US "military did not land in China because the Japanese devils surrendered too quickly, but because their strategic staff ultimately decided not to land in China at all during the entire war against Japan." Today, Chinese and American reactionaries sophistically argue that "the US military's landing in China is part of the entire US military's strategic plan for the war against Japan." The above historical facts prove that at any time, the US military's stationing in China is also the opposite of China's independence and freedom. And the blatant armed intervention in China's internal affairs by the US military over the past year exceeds any previous period and can be compared to the actions of the Japanese army in Northeast China and the Tianjin area before the July 7th Incident.

    The illegal actions of the US military in China over the past year have aroused the unanimous opposition of peace-loving people around the world. With the support of the world's peaceful and democratic forces, the great strength of the Chinese people will surely achieve the goal of forcing the US military to withdraw from China.

　　论美军驻华一周年
    曾彦修
    一年以前日寇投降的一个半月以后，美国军队开始在华北登陆，从那天起，美国帝国主义便露骨地武装干涉中国内政。一年以来，美国当局为国民党运送了数十万军队到东北华北和华中前线，进行了反对中国人民的内战，供应了国民党以较抗战时期多几倍的军火物资装备，和训练了较抗战时期多两倍的四十个国民党师团，美国的海军陆战队、飞机频繁地骚扰解放区。此外美国军事顾问团则参与了蒋介石内战的戎机，执行其“观察训练术在战场上的效果，指示他们使用和保持装备，一般的说即帮助中国人（即进行内战的蒋介石）应用他们所学来的作战经验”（今年三月九日魏德迈语）的任务。所有这些，就构成了中国内战爆发、扩大以致演进为今天的全面内战的最根本原因。这种情况，正直的美国人早就感觉到。去年十一月一个美国士兵在上海美军“花旗报”上就说过：中国的内战，美国人已做完了一切，就“只把实际按开枪机留给国民党的士兵去干”。
    现在美军已准备在中国长期驻扎，月前来华与蒋介石政府签订出售美军在西太平洋剩余物资的美陆军部助理次长彼德森等一行，曾于上月飞平布置此事，上海大公报报导“此行与美军长期驻华有关”，并谓“未来之北平将为最大之美军驻扎区域”。此种放肆侵害中国主权的侵略行为，完全违反罗斯福时代一九四三年春中美新约的精神。在该条约中，罗斯福领导的美国政府声明放弃过去因借不平等条约在中国享有的一切特权，其中包括驻兵权在内。在这里回忆一下过去美军驻华的历史，是完全必要的。世人皆知，美国在华享有驻兵权，也和其他帝国主义一样起于一九○○年八国联军占领北京后之辛丑条约，此后美国即一直在中国驻有海军及其陆战队，这些军队只在一个时期离开过中国，那就是中国抗战最艰难的一九三九年——一九四五年时期。一九三九年日寇在中国沦陷区发动反英美运动，以遂其压迫英美强迫国民党当局接受东方慕尼黑的阴谋。当时美国接受了日寇的要求，相继撤退在华美军，直至去年美军重新在华登陆为止，这又是众所周知的。当然美军这时期的撤离中国，决不是为了尊重中国的主权，而只是对日寇侵略的让步和鼓励。自美军在太平洋转入反攻后，中国人民即曾希望美军在华登陆以便配合中国人民并肩作战，但是这一个在中国驻扎了几十年的美国军队，恰恰没有在这时期登陆，魏德迈去年十月二十二日曾在华盛顿揭露了这件极为重要的事实，他说：“应该说明的，是美国从来不曾在中国有过陆上作战部队，并且也从未计划过派遣这种部队去………我们计划是大规模攻击日本本岛，美国也抽不出作战部队派到中国。”因此美国“军队并不是因为日寇投降快了来不及在中国登陆，而是他们的战略参谋部最后决定在整个对日作战时期根本不在中国登陆。”今天中美反动派像煞有介事的诡辩“美军在华登陆，是整个美军对日作战战略一部分”，其无耻就可知了。以上这些历史事实证明，在任何一个时期，美军驻华也是中国独立自由的对立物。而一年以来美军的公开武装干涉中国内政的横蛮举动，超出以前任何一个时期，并且可以和七七以前日军在东北和平津一带的行动相比拟。
    一年来美军在华的不法行为，已经引起世界和平人士的一致反对，中国人民的伟大力量，在世界和平民主势力声援之下，一定要达到迫使美军撤离中国之目的。
