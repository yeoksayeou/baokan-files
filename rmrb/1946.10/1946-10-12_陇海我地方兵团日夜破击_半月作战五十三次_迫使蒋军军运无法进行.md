　　Local Troops in Longhai Harass Enemy Day and Night
    53 Battles in Half a Month
    Forcing Chiang's Military Transport to Halt
    [This newspaper's dispatch from the Longhai Front, 9th] Our local troops along the Longhai line have launched harassing and intercepting operations, forcing Chiang's military transport to halt. Guerrilla units along the Longhai line have launched fierce harassing attacks and intercepted Chiang's transport units. In the past half-month, according to incomplete statistics, there have been 53 battles of varying scales. More than 370 Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, 521 were captured alive, and more than 280 rifles and short guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 7 light machine guns, 2 radio stations, and 5 vehicles were seized. 18 large carts of grain, 4 large carts of cotton cloth, 140 bags of rice were captured, 6 bridges and 6 *li* of highway were destroyed, and 5 *li* of railway were destroyed. Just on one day, local troops in our Third Sub-district intercepted a Chiang army transport team in Dangshan, seizing two trucks fully loaded with rice, capturing 10 Chiang soldiers, and seizing a portion of ammunition. A bridge at the Luo Wang Station west of Lanfeng on the Longhai Railway was also destroyed by our troops, and 5 *li* of railway were damaged, derailing a train full of Chiang's military supplies. Currently, Chiang's military transport on the Longhai line is experiencing extreme difficulties.
