　　【Changzhi News from Our Newspaper】: Niu Gaicheng, Director of the Armed Committee of Ancheng Village in Changzhi, and Deputy Director Niu Guozhao, along with Instructor Niu Baosi, led all 42 militiamen in the village to collectively join the army. Influenced by them, another 60 young people signed up. Immediately, a company, platoon, and squad leaders were selected according to the army's organizational structure and named "Ancheng People's Emancipation Company." In Wan Village, Fifth District, sixteen-year-old hired laborer Feng Baohao overheard people in a neighboring cave discussing joining the army. He immediately put on his clothes and ran to the village office to sign up. After being dissuaded, he hugged the legs of the worker and comrades and cried loudly, insisting on going. During the conscription movement, men, women, old and young in all villages enthusiastically helped the new and old military dependents with the autumn harvest. After 19 young people from Jiajiazhuang joined the army, the masses immediately helped them with the autumn harvest and plowed the land. The masses' slogan is: "Everything for the victory at the front, ensuring that the Self-Defense Army can go to the front line with peace of mind to defeat the enemy." Furthermore, it is reported that more than 1,500 people have now signed up to join the army in Bo'ai County. The militiamen of Baijiaoshu Village and others also collectively joined the army under the leadership of their captain.
