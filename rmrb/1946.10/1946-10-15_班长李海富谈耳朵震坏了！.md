Squad Leader Li Haifu Talks About Ears Damaged by Explosions!
Guns Jammed Shut!

Hu Zongnan's 167th Brigade, after expending countless artillery shells, cautiously advanced only to the halfway point of Xijiuling Mountain in Fushan, where they were intercepted by the Eighth Route Army and forced to retreat. Our squad leader, Zhang Dinglong, with two men, wielding three rifles with bayonets, gleaming coldly, pursued them.

At this time, the 167th Brigade's artillery resumed firing, attempting to prevent Zhang Dinglong and his men from advancing. However, the shells were inaccurate, mostly landing behind Zhang Dinglong. Then, a bomber plane arrived to assist, but it hesitated to bomb because Zhang Dinglong was too close to the Kuomintang troops.

Seeing this, Tian Chengsheng, in a fury, also led a few men to charge down from above, rushing to within six or seven meters of the enemy, firing a volley, and then retreating. The 167th Brigade seized this opportunity to pursue. Zhang Dinglong, seeing this clearly, quickly covered Tian Chengsheng and his men as they retreated. On a ridge [＠① in the original text], a machine gun peeked out. Zhang Dinglong and his men waited for the gunner to pause, then jumped behind the machine gunner. Then, another group of men came out to pursue. Zhang Dinglong used his sharpshooting skills, taking them down one by one. Finally, several grenades were thrown, and the enemy was completely finished. However, Zhang Dinglong's rifle had been fired so much that it was jammed shut. Fortunately, Tian Chengsheng was nearly in a safe area.

But another group of men from the 167th Brigade charged forward. Zhang Dinglong put down his rifle, grabbed several grenades, and threw them. A burst of explosions knocked everyone down.

Ears Damaged by Explosions!

The Kuomintang army's hidden bunker in the northeast corner of Guanque Village had already been captured by our first platoon and the seventh squad of the second platoon. The company ordered our fifth and sixth squads to search the houses in front. We followed the ridge [＠ in the original text], turned down the corner, and ran south. Just as we reached the corner of the wall, five enemies came out of the hidden bunker. I rushed at them alone. They were so weak, not even daring to look back, just running. After chasing them for forty or fifty meters, I saw them captured by the ×× unit. Only then did I return. The platoon leader ordered our squad to jump over the wall into the courtyard to search. I led the deputy squad leader, Song Yisheng, and Li Lanping, and as we jumped into the courtyard, the Kuomintang troops in the cave discovered us and fired a burst of machine-gun bullets. We quickly hid behind their fortifications. We quickly signaled the fifth squad to fire with their machine gun, and we followed up with grenades. We shot down two of the Kuomintang troops, and the others burrowed into the tunnel. We quickly approached both sides of the cave entrance, throwing grenades and shouting for them to surrender. We ceased firing, and the fifth squad leader came down from the top of the cave. The Kuomintang troops shouted from inside the window, "We want to surrender!" So we told them to come out empty-handed. The first one out was the squad leader. He said, "We shouted that we wanted to surrender a long time ago, but your firepower never stopped!" We realized that our comrades' ears had been damaged by the machine guns and grenades and hadn't heard the enemy shouting. This time, in addition to the prisoners, we captured two machine guns, one submachine gun, and six rifles.

　　班长李海富谈耳朵震坏了！
    枪打得拉不开拴了！
    胡宗南的一六七旅花费了难以计算的炮弹，畏畏缩缩的刚到浮山西九岭的半山里，又被八路军截击回来。我们的班长张顶龙带着两个人，持着三支带刺刀的枪，寒光闪闪的追下去。
    这时那一六七旅的大炮又轰击起来，阻击张顶龙等向前进，可是炮弹很不准确，老落在张顶龙的背后，这时又有一架轰炸机过来助战，张顶龙距离蒋军太近了，它不敢轰炸。
    这时眼红了的田成生也带上几个人从上面冲下来，冲到距离人家六七米远地方，打一阵又返回来，可是一六七旅抓住这个机会就追击。张顶龙看得很清楚，赶忙去掩护着田成生一伙人退却，在一条＠①上有一挺机枪露出头来，张顶龙等看机枪手一停，就跳到机枪手的后边去了，接着又出来一伙人追击。张顶龙又使用他百发百中的本领射击着，一枪一个，最后又接连几个炸弹，敌人完全结束了，可是张顶龙的枪打得太多了，已经拉不开栓，好在田成生已快到安全地区。
    但是一六七旅又跑出一伙人强冲过来，张顶龙放下枪拉起几个炸弹扔过去，一阵爆炸所有的人又倒下去了。
    耳朵震坏了！
    官雀村东北角的胡宗南军队的暗碉堡，已经被我们一排和二排七班占领了，连里的命令，叫我们五，六班去前边的房子里搜索，我们沿着＠，向下转过地角，又向南跑去，正走到墙角边，五个敌人从暗碉堡里出来了，我一个人扑了过去，他们真稀松，头也不敢回只管跑，追了四五十公尺，我看见他们被××部队捉住了，我才返回来，排长又叫我们班跳墙到院里去搜索，我带上副班长宋义盛和李兰平往院里一跳，窑里蒋军发觉了，打过来一梭机枪子弹，我们赶紧隐蔽在他们的工事后面。很快告诉五班机枪射击，我们也紧跟着投弹，蒋军被我们打倒了两个，其他钻进了地洞，我们很快接近到窑门的两侧，一面投手榴弹，一面喊叫缴枪。我们停止射击，五班长从窑顶上下来，蒋军在窗里喊：“要缴枪！”于是我们便叫他们空着手出来。第一个出来的就是班长，他说：“我们早就喊要缴枪，你们火力不停止”，我们才知道原来我们的同志被机枪和手榴弹震坏了耳朵，就没听见敌人叫喊。这回除俘虏外，缴了两挺机枪，一挺手提式机枪，六支步枪。
