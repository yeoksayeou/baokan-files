Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 17th. Combined reports from various locations: The people of Northern Jiangsu and Central Jiangsu are launching resolute struggles against the invaders through various methods such as attacks, ambushes, encirclements, road destruction, and laying landmines. In the Donghai area, the militia and guerrillas severely attacked the invading forces of the traitors Zhou Fagan and Liu Dashui. From September 19th to 26th, in one week, they recovered 38 villages and towns of varying sizes in the southwestern Donghai area, killing over 50 Chiang and puppet troops, and capturing 75 Chiang-appointed district chiefs and lower ranks. The remnants of Zhou and Liu fled back to Xinba. In northern Suqian, on September 24th, 22 Chiang-appointed "Returning Home Corps" members advanced eastward towards Xu Tangji, but were intercepted by the militia and none survived. The militia in areas such as Youhedong, Xialuji, Daxinglai, and Longtanghu in the suburbs of Suqian city fought over 60 battles in the middle and late September, eradicating 7 Chiang army strongholds including Luowei and Nanwei (10 li southeast of the city), killing and wounding over 80 Chiang soldiers, capturing 75 Chiang-appointed district chiefs and lower ranks, and seizing 28 rifles and many other military supplies. The militia in various districts of Siyang are active; Chiang soldiers dare not leave the city for half a li with only three to five men. After the Chiang army occupied the Bajizhen town northeast of Siyang, the militia immediately laid landmines around it, preventing Chiang soldiers from taking a single step outside. The Zhongxing district militia once killed a Chiang army battalion commander, wounded a company commander, and captured 10 soldiers. In Taixing, Central Jiangsu, the militia are active near the Chiang army stronghold port, and during a night raid on September 23rd, they captured 11 Chiang army intelligence agents and killed 5. On September 28th, the Baipu Chiang army compiled Baojia household registration, but four were killed by the guerrillas, and they fled back in a panic. On September 21st, the Jiangjing Chiang army inspected household registrations in Gushan, but were completely routed by the militia. The highways controlled by the Chiang army are also frequently destroyed. The activities of the Chiang army and Chiang regime are still limited to very small points and lines.
