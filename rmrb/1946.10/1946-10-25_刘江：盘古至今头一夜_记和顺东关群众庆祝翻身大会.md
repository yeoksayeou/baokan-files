　　Liu Jiang: The First Night Since Pangu
    A Record of the He Shun Dongguan Masses Celebrating Their Emancipation
    The people of Dongguan have designated September 23rd as Emancipation Memorial Day.

    That five-colored silk-draped archway, more than three zhang high, in front of the Experimental Elementary School, was quite the sight to behold.

    As soon as it got dark, the four large gauze lanterns on the archway lit up, and accompanied by whistles, men, women, old, and young flowed through the streets like shuttles. Even the eighty-year-old Wang Gengyang was energetic as he "squeezed" through the crowd, saying with a beaming smile, "I never thought I'd live to see this day!" He happily skirted rows of tables and chairs, sitting down tightly in front of Chairman Mao's portrait.

    Eight large oil lamps hung on the four walls of the courtyard, and forty-three lamps lit up forty-three tables, brightly illuminating the smiling faces of over one hundred and eighty old women and daughters-in-law, and over two hundred men. In the center, Chairman Mao's large portrait seemed to be smiling at the emancipated people in the bright light.

    "We've turned ourselves over completely, but how do we live from now on? – I think we should just talk freely!" After Farmers' Association Chairman Li Peirong spoke, there was a warm burst of applause.

    "Our bodies have been freed, but if we don't want to fall back into misfortune in the future, we must engage in mutual aid and boost production; we must also unite to fight Chiang Kai-shek!" Emancipation Model Zhang Chengke, holding his mouthless dry tobacco pipe, stood on a bench, waving it around as he spoke.

    Women's Association Chairman Feng Linmei said: "We women must immediately participate in the autumn harvest, and in the winter, we must get those fifty spinning wheels turning; we must also raise pigs... I don't have any yet." A hint of innocent shyness appeared on her joyful face.

    "Other people's wives and children will still have livelihoods in winter, and we old men, this winter, will work harder to collect manure – if the crops don't have manure, then that's just being foolish," said eighty-year-old Wang Gengyang, looking at Chairman Mao beside him, "Now that I've been emancipated, if I don't have a livelihood, I'll be letting down Chairman Mao."

    Zuo Fubao and Li Guangmin proposed a common idea: We must immediately launch a "Four Nos" movement for production and prosperity: No wastefulness, no laziness, no being overly critical, and no idleness. If you want five sheng, you have to get up at five o'clock in the morning...".

    "Agreed!" "Yes!" Shouts and applause mixed together.

    Their words seemed to remind everyone, and the venue immediately became restless. Wang Sinian said: "Since Dongguan has been emancipated, we already have a hundred donkeys. This winter, we must set up a good transport team, and it won't be a problem to wear 'Three News' for the New Year (the goals in this spring's production plan: everyone should have new clothes, new watches, and new cotton-padded clothes made of new cotton for the New Year). If we do a good job of transporting, we can buy another shirt next year, and we'll have 'Four News'."

    The new atmosphere of production after emancipation was fully displayed.

    With the liquor pot placed on the table, the drums and music began to play. They were playing and singing Yangge from Wu Xiang. Three of the singers were "bastards" who had just been emancipated (a derogatory term used to insult them in the old society), two were newly emancipated yin-yang masters, and three were farmers. Tonight was the first time they sang for their own joy and that of their brothers.

    It was really lively! The men shouted "Four Happinesses and Prosperity", and the women shouted "Chicken, Worm, Stick, Tiger." The liquor pot seemed to be flying in the air without touching the ground, and people were shouting and singing with such abandon that it was truly "the first night since Pangu" in Chinese history.

    Li Guangmin said that drinking such happy wine today was the first time since he was born. He said: "In the past, I drank wine at landlords' red and white events, but at that time, my wife and children didn't even have rice to eat." Du Sibao said: "In the past, drinking wine was like drinking under the feet of the landlord, but today I'm drinking to pour out all the grievances in my stomach." As he spoke, he waved his fist at Zhang Chengke: "The champion of the five metals!..."

    The joyous and unified cries and shouts shook the late autumn night, and the three stars had already risen.

    Li Yingxi's (a blind beggar in the past) lively slogans shocked the people from the sea of toasting for emancipation:

    "We were only emancipated when the Eighth Route Army came!"

    "Only the poor live a good life!"

    "Don't forget the Communist Party after emancipation!"

    "We'll never forget our Mao Zedong even in death!"

    This carnival celebrating emancipation began to disperse amidst the slogans of "Long live the emancipation of the peasants" which continued for a long time.

　　刘江：盘古至今头一夜
    记和顺东关群众庆祝翻身大会
    九月二十三这天，东关人民把它定成了翻身纪念日。
    实验小学校门前那座三丈多高的五色缎置彩楼，该是多么吸引人呢。
    天刚黑，彩楼上的四盏大纱灯就亮起来了，伴随着哨声，男女老少穿梭似的在街上奔流。八十岁的王更羊老汉也是精神焕发的在人群里“圪挤”着：“真想不到我还能见上这世面！”他喜笑颜开的绕过一行行的桌凳，紧紧的坐到毛主席的像前。
    院里四面墙上挂着八盏大油灯、四十三张桌上点着四十三盏灯，可就把一百八十多个老娘媳妇和二百多男人的笑脸照了个亮。正中央毛主席的大画像，也像在明亮的灯光里，对着翻身的人们在微笑。
    “咱们身是翻透啦，光景怎过呀？——我看随便谈吧！”农会主席李培荣讲罢话，跟着是好热烈的一阵掌声呀。
    “身是翻了，要想以后不倒运，总得搞互助闹生产；还要团结起来打老蒋！”翻身模范张成科拿着他的没嘴旱烟袋站在板凳上、划来划去的说着。
    妇女会主席冯林梅说：“俺老婆们要马上参加大收秋，冬里要把那五十架纺花车齐让它转起来；还要喂猪……俺没咧。”在她高兴的面容上露出了一丝天真的羞涩。
    “人家老婆孩们冬天还要有营生，俺这伙老汉，今年冬里要加劲拾粪——庄稼没粪，那才叫胡混。”八十岁的王更羊老汉，眼瞅着他身旁的毛主席说：“我翻了身，要是没营生，就对不起咱毛主席。”
    左福保和李广民提了个共同意见：咱们立刻要展开个生产发家“四不”运动：一不浪费，二不懒，三不尖，四不闲。要有五升，就得起五更…………”。
    “赞成”！“同意”！喊声和掌声交杂在一起。
    他俩的一席话，像是提醒了大家，会场立刻起了一阵骚动。王四年说：“咱东关这一翻身，已经有了一百条驴，冬里可要搞个好运输队哩，过大年穿上“三表新”不成问题（今春生产计划里的奋斗目标：每人赶年要新里、新表、新棉花的棉衣）。搞好运输了，明年再添买一件衬衣，就够四表新了。”
    翻身后的一片生产新气象，完全表现出来了。
          ×        ×        ×
    烧酒壶往桌上一摆，鼓乐就吹打起来了。吹唱的是武乡秧歌。吹唱的人们，有三个是这次才翻身的“王八”（这是旧社会对他们侮辱的称呼），两个是刚翻身的阴阳先生，还有三个农民。他们今夜是第一次为自己及自己兄弟们的欢欣而歌唱。
    真热闹呀！男人们喊得是“四喜发财”，妇女们喊得是“鸡、虫、棒、虎”。酒壶不落地的像是在空中飞着，人们那般纵情的高呼和歌唱，在中国史页上，确实是“盘古至今头一夜”。
    李广民说，他像喝今天这样痛快的酒，是出得娘胎头一场。他说：“我过去给人家地主办红白事也喝过酒，可是那会老婆孩们还没米吃哩。”杜四保说：“从前喝酒是在地主脚底下踩喝的，今天我是把肚里的冤气倒干喝酒的。”他说着说着就向张成科挥起拳来了：“五金魁首！……”
    快乐而融成一片的叫声，喊声，震撼着初秋的深夜，三星已经升起来了。
    李迎喜（过去是个讨饭的瞎子）活泼的口号，把人们从为翻身而干杯的大海中震惊了：
    “八路军来咱才翻了身！”
    “穷人才过上好光景！”
    “翻身不忘共产党！”
    “死也忘不了咱毛泽东！”
    这场庆祝翻身的狂欢，在“农民翻身万万岁”赓续很长时间的口号中始散。
