Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 9th: Chiang's troops of the 60th Brigade (reorganized from the 99th Division, formerly the 99th Army), stationed in Xiaodianzi, more than twenty miles north of Suqian, launched a two-pronged eastward attack on the 6th with a portion of their 178th Regiment. The New Fourth Army intercepted them in the Yugai (more than ten miles southwest of Shaodian) area, annihilating the majority of them, capturing over two hundred Chiang's Suqian County Magistrate and officers and soldiers below the battalion commander level, and seizing eleven mountain guns and mortars, two heavy machine guns, sixteen light machine guns, and over a hundred rifles.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Shanghai News: Since the Kuomintang army launched a large-scale offensive against northern Jiangsu, the Kuomintang army's wounded soldiers from the northern Jiangsu front have been continuously transported to Shanghai. In mid-September, a batch of several dozen people arrived from Tianshenggang. Their wounds were mostly festering, swarming with maggots, and no one cared for them. They groaned by the roadside, causing passersby to feel deeply saddened.
