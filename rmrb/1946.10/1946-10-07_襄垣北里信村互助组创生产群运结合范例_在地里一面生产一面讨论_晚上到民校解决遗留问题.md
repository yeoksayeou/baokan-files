　　[Report from Xiangyuan] The Xincun village mutual aid group in Beili, Xiangyuan county, continued to deepen the mass movement during the autumn harvest and planting seasons, discovering and resolving various remaining issues. The fourteen mutual aid groups discussed while producing in the fields during the day and rapidly solved problems at night in people's schools. The Ge Zhongbao group, after three days of discussion, discovered that the poor peasant Li Anlun was afraid to speak and had been allocated too little land, and had not yet truly turned himself around; Wang Suohai had served in the puppet army and was now falsely acting as an activist, having been allocated too much land. These issues were all resolved through mass discussion in the people's school, creating a model of combining production and mass movement. Many groups discovered that after the fruits of the struggle were distributed, the masses were following two different paths. One path was advocated by Chairman Mao, and was also the path followed by most people here – diligence and frugality, becoming prosperous and wealthy. For example, Jiang Yansheng, Bai Shihe, and twenty-one other households bought land, livestock, and farm implements with the fruits of their struggle to develop production. Jiang Yansheng used to be a poor peasant, and his wife and children begged for food. Now he has thirty-two mu of land, and he puts effort into intensive farming, and this year his crops are growing particularly well. The masses praised these people. The other path was inherited from the old society, and was followed by a very small number of people in the village – idleness and wastefulness. For example, middle peasant Han Xigui neglected four mu of the five mu of land he was allocated, ate the grain he was given, and paid the mutual aid group for his labor, freeing up time to chase after women. The masses gave this kind of person strict admonition and criticism. The freedom to "chat" allowed the masses to continue to delve deeper, gradually revealing the issue of individual cadres embezzling the fruits of struggle, which had been hidden in their hearts. At a specially convened farmers' association meeting, the masses raised the issue that in February, the cadres had privately divided some things among themselves. The chairman and vice-chairman of the farmers' association immediately admitted the facts and made self-criticisms to the masses. The atmosphere at the meeting was very harmonious. The masses said, "The cadres led us to turn ourselves around, they worked hard and contributed, so it doesn't matter if they make small mistakes, it's alright as long as they don't make them again!" The cadres said, "The masses are so generous to us, we will never be selfish again, we must serve everyone well."

　　襄垣北里信村互助组创生产群运结合范例
    在地里一面生产一面讨论
    晚上到民校解决遗留问题
    【本报襄垣讯】本县北里信村在秋收秋种中继续深入群运，发现并解决各种遗留问题。十四个互助组白天在地里一面生产一面讨论，晚上到民校迅速解决问题。葛中保组经过三天讨论发现了贫农李安伦不敢说话分地太少尚未翻透身，王锁孩当过伪军，现在是假积极，分地太多等问题，都在民校中经群众讨论解决，创造了生产与群运结合的范例。许多组发现了斗争果实分配后群众走着两条不同的道路，一条是毛主席提倡的，也是这里大多数人走的——勤劳节俭、发家致富，如江彦生、白仕何等廿一户，都把斗争果实买了土地、牲口、农具来发展生产长江彦生过去是贫农，孩子老婆都讨饭，现在已有了卅二亩地，他下工夫精耕细作，今年庄稼长得特别好，群众表扬了这些人。另一条路是旧社会遗留下来，也是村里极少数人走的——游手好闲、浪费腐化的道路，如中农韩喜贵分了五亩地即荒了四亩，分了粮食坐着吃，给互助组掏工钱，空出种地时间搞女人，群众对这种人作了严格的劝导和批评。自由“圪扯”，继续深入群众陆续说出过去藏在心里的个别干部贪污斗争果实问题，在一个特别为此召开的农会大会上群众提出二月间干部们私自分了一些东西，农会主席和副主席等立即承认实有其事，并向群众作了自我批评。会场空气十分融洽，群众说：“干部领导咱们翻身，又误工又出力，犯点小错误不算啥，下次不犯就对了！”干部说：“群众这样宽大咱们，以后再不自私自利了，一定要好好给大家办事”。
