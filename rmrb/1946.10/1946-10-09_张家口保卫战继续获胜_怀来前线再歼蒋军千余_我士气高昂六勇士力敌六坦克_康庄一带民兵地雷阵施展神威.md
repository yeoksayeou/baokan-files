Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 5th, 7:00 AM: The Zhangjiakou defense continues to achieve victories. Following the annihilation of over three thousand Chiang troops by the Eighth Route Army on the strong defense line of Huailai on the 3rd, from 9:00 PM on the 4th to 5:00 AM this morning, over one thousand two hundred Chiang troops were killed, wounded, or captured east of Huailai, and nine heavy artillery pieces were destroyed. Detailed battle results are still being tallied. The main force of Chiang's 16th Army, after being severely struck on the night of the 3rd, saw its 109th Division routed and demoralized. The remnants are trapped in strongholds such as Dazhuang and Nanxin Village, about twenty miles east of Huailai. On the night of the 4th, a unit of the Eighth Route Army attacked the Chiang troops there again, completely annihilating two entire battalions of Chiang infantry. The 109th Division headquarters and its directly subordinate independent battalion, special service battalion, and engineer battalion were also heavily damaged.

Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 5th: In recent days, reporters have been meeting and talking with the heroic soldiers of the Eighth Route Army on the front lines. They have reached a unanimous conclusion from several days of defensive battles: the latest American-equipped equipment, driven by demoralized Chiang officers and soldiers, is just as effective as the proverb says, "A spendthrift who gets gold will never get rich." On October 3rd, when Chiang's troops attacked Huoshaoying east of Huailai, they consistently used nine American-style tanks to lead the way. The Eighth Route Army soldiers waited for the tanks to get close before bombarding them with concentrated hand grenades. These steel monsters would crawl back as soon as they heard the explosions, and several times failed to cross the children's soldiers' fortifications by even one step. In another small position, six warriors repelled the attacks of six Chiang tanks with hand grenades and machine guns several times in a row. Several hundred Chiang troops attacked the Eighth Route Army's position at Jiaozhuang, firing over four hundred American heavy artillery shells, presuming that the Eighth Route Army defenders had been annihilated. They boldly rushed up, but the Eighth Route Army warriors, covered in dust, suddenly stood up and pounced on them with bayonets and hand grenades. As a result, forty bodies of the annihilated invaders were left on the Eighth Route Army's position.

Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 5th: "Dig graves for Chiang Kai-shek's invading army anytime, anywhere," is a common saying of the militia explosive teams in the Chahar border area. In the first two days of the war, over three hundred Chiang officers and soldiers, burned and battered, were buried in the graves prepared by the militia. On September 29th, a unit of Chiang's 16th Army entered Cha Fuqian Street, and an entire row of people were buried by six large landmines at the entrance of the village, so that not even bodies could be found. On the same day, when a company of Chiang troops attacked a corner position in Yingchengzi, they stepped on more than seventy interconnected landmines, and no officer or soldier in the entire company escaped the sea of fire of the landmines. Entering the empty village of Xiboz, the dense ranks of Chiang troops who were marching were blown into the air by the landmine array on the street, killing and wounding more than twenty people. On the 30th, the Kangzhuang militia joined the war and cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to defend their homeland, detonating sixty-five mother-son mines on the front line, killing more than one hundred Chiang troops. Chiang's troops launched four consecutive assaults, all of which failed.

　　张家口保卫战继续获胜
    怀来前线再歼蒋军千余
    我士气高昂六勇士力敌六坦克
    康庄一带民兵地雷阵施展神威
    【新华社平绥东线五日七时电】张家口保卫战继续获得胜利，在三日怀来坚强防线前被八路军歼灭蒋军三千余之后，四日夜二十一时，至今晨五时，怀来城东毙伤俘蒋军一千二百余人，毁重炮九门，详细战果正清查中。蒋军第十六军主力经三日夜间严重打击，其一○九师已溃不成军，残部困守于怀来城东二十余里之大庄、南辛村等据点。四日夜，八路军一部复向该处蒋军出击，计完全歼灭蒋军步兵两个整营，另一○九师师部及其直属的独立营、特务营、工兵营等亦遭重创。
    【新华社平绥东线五日电】连日来记者在火线上和八路军健儿晤谈，他们在数日自卫战斗中得出一致的结论是：由士气不振的蒋军官兵们驾驶的最新式美械装备，其效用正如民谚所说的“败家子拿了黄金，到底也发不了财”。十月三日蒋军进犯怀来城东火烧营时，始终以九辆美式坦克冲在前面，八路军战士们等坦克逼近了才用手榴弹集中轰击，这些钢铁怪物一听到爆炸就爬回去了，几次没有能越过子弟兵的工事一步。在另一处狭小的阵地里，六个勇士连续数次以手榴弹机枪击退了六辆蒋军坦克的进攻。数百蒋军进攻焦庄八路军阵地，曾以美式重炮发射炮弹四百余发，满以为八路军守卫者都被歼灭了，便大胆冲上来，混身被尘土埋着的八路军勇士们，等蒋军逼近，突然站起来，用刺刀、手榴弹向他们猛扑，结果四十具被歼灭的进犯者的尸体遗留在八路军阵地上。
    【新华社平绥东线五日电】“随时随地给蒋介石进犯军挖掘坟墓”，这是察哈尔边沿区民兵爆炸组常爱说的一句话。在战事爆发的头两天，就有三百多个蒋军官兵焦头烂额的葬身在民兵们给预备下的坟穴里。上月二十九日，蒋军第十六军一部，进入岔幅前街，整整一排人全部被埋于村口六颗大地雷炸的连尸体都寻不见了。当日蒋军一个连进攻营城子某隅阵地时，又踏响了相互纽结的七十多个地雷，全连官兵一个也没有逃出地雷的火海。进入西拨子空村，正在行进的蒋军密集的队伍，被街上的地雷阵炸得飞腾起来，死伤了二十多名。三十日康庄的民兵参战队协同八路军守卫着自己的乡土，在火线上拉响了六十五颗子母雷，炸毙蒋军一百多名。蒋军连续发动四次冲锋，均未得逞。
