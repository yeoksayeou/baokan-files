Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 26th: Moscow dispatch: Pravda observer Zhukov wrote an article commenting on the Indian situation, stating that under the pressure of the developing anti-imperialist movement in India and its neighboring countries, the British government was forced to make some formal concessions to the demands of the Indian people. These concessions are the establishment of a constitutional system elected by a provisional legislative assembly and the establishment of an Indian provisional government headed by Nehru, the leader of the Congress Party, as Deputy Prime Minister. The purpose is to consolidate British colonial rule in India under new circumstances with new figures. It is unfounded to think that the establishment of the new government will guarantee India's independence. In fact, the Nehru government is still under the control of the British Empire, and the Governor-General retains the "veto power" over any decision of this provisional government. British troops remain in India, and the Indian army is still commanded by British generals.
  List of the Indian Provisional Government
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 28th: The official list of the Indian Provisional Government is as follows: The chairman is the British Emperor Wavell, the vice chairman is Nehru, and the ministers of the Ministry of Interior and Intelligence, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the Ministry of Education and Arts, the Ministry of Transportation and Railways, and the Ministry of Labor are all held by representatives of the Congress Party. Members of the Muslim League are in charge of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Transportation, Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Public Health. The Sikh Baldev Singh is the Minister of Defense, Bappa is the Minister of Public Works, and the Indian Christian John Mathai is the Minister of Industry and Mining. It is reported that the Minister of Interior was originally to be appointed by the Muslim League, but Nehru strongly opposed it, and Wavell's compromise with Nehru ended the matter. Although the new government is called a coalition government, it does not have a common program of action.

    临时政府无独立性仍为帝国主义工具
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科讯：真理报观察家朱科夫著文评印度局势称：在印度及其邻近国家发展中的反帝国主义运动压力下，英政府被迫对印度人民的要求作了某些形式上的让步。这些让步是建立由临时立法议会选举的立宪政体，与建立以国大领袖尼赫鲁为副总理的印度临时政府，其目的即在新的情况下以新的人物来巩固英国在印度的殖民地统治。如果认为新政府的建立便能保证印度达到独立，这种想法是没有根据的。事实上尼赫鲁政府仍然在英帝国控制之下，总督对于这一临时政府的任何决定保持着“否决权”。英国军队依然留在印度，而印度军队还是由英国的将官指挥。
  印度临时政府名单
    【新华社延安二十八日电】印度临时政府正式名单如下：主席为英皇魏菲尔，副主席为尼赫鲁，内政兼情报部农业兼粮食部教育艺术部运输铁道部劳工部均由国大党代表充任部长，而回教同盟人员担负的职务为财政部商务部交通邮电部公共卫生部长，司法部锡克族巴尔德夫·信格任国防部长，巴帕任公共工程部长，印度基督教徒约翰马达出任工业采矿部长。据悉内政部长原由回教同盟出任，但尼赫鲁激烈反对，复以魏菲尔对尼氏妥协告终。新政府虽名为联合政府，但却未有共同施政纲领。
