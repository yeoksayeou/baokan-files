　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Reports from various sources indicate that UN Secretary-General Lie's report on the situation in Spain has garnered significant attention from representatives of various countries at the UN General Assembly. On the 24th, Lie appealed to the United Nations General Assembly to find ways to restore a free and democratic government in Spain. Lie pointed out that if the Franco regime continues to exist, Spain will constantly be a source of mutual distrust and discord among the founders of the United Nations. Lie urged the General Assembly to immediately provide guidance on the relationship between the United Nations and the Franco government. The Security Council is currently in a deadlock on this issue. Lie stated that as Secretary-General of the United Nations, he is extremely concerned about this issue. Lie's report was welcomed by representatives from countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and India. The US delegation is holding a special meeting to decide on the US's attitude towards Lie's statement. The British delegation believes that Britain's attitude towards the Franco regime has been frequently explained by Britain, and Lie's opinion "somewhat exceeds the scope of the Secretary-General's report." The Associated Press commented that, according to the UN Charter, the Secretary-General has the right to raise issues if he believes there is a situation threatening international peace and security.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Rome Dispatch: A mass rally against the Franco regime was held here on the 20th to welcome the delegation of the Spanish Socialist Youth Federation to Italy. Representatives from the Action Party, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Republican Party all unanimously demanded that the Italian government sever diplomatic relations with Franco. The delegation, while attending the Italian Youth Congress, reported on the heroic struggle of the Spanish people against Franco. It is reported that since Franco came to power, the total number of political prisoners has reached two million, and there are currently 200,000 political prisoners in jail. However, the underground movement against Franco continues to expand, and guerrilla warfare activities are becoming increasingly intense. In the months before August alone, there were 78 major strikes. There are 16 kinds of secret magazines. The delegation demanded that all democratic countries sever diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain.

　　联合国秘书长莱氏主张恢复西班牙民主政府
    罗马举行反佛朗哥群众大会
    【新华社延安二十六日电】各方报导：联合国秘书长莱氏关于西班牙情势的报告，引起联合国大会各国代表的重视。二十四日莱氏在联合国大会上吁请联合国家设法在西班牙恢复自由而民主的政府，莱氏指出佛朗哥政权如依然存在，则西班牙将经常是联合国缔造者之间相互不信任不协调的根源。莱氏吁请大会立即将联合国家与佛朗哥政府之关系予以指导。安理会关于此一问题目前处于僵局中。莱氏表示：作为联合国的秘书长，他对此一问题极为关切。莱氏的报告，受到苏波印等国代表的欢迎。美代表团正召开特别会议，以决定美国对莱氏声明的态度。英代表团认为英国对佛朗哥政权的态度已由英国经常说明，而莱氏的意见则“多少超过秘书长报告之范围”。合众社评称：根据联合国宪章，秘书长如认为有威胁国际和平与安全之情势，他是有权提出的。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】罗马讯：此间于二十日举行反佛朗哥政权的群众大会，以欢迎西班牙社会主义青年联合会代表团之抵意。行动党、社会党、共产党及共和党代表均一致要求意政府断绝对佛朗哥邦交。该代表团在参加意青年大会上，报告了西班牙人民反佛朗哥的英勇斗争。据称：自佛朗哥执政以来，被囚之政治犯总数已达二百万人，现有政治犯二十万人被禁狱中。但反佛朗哥之地下运动仍不断扩大，游击战活动日益紧张。仅在八月前数月，即曾爆发大罢工七十八次。秘密杂志达十六种。该代表要求所有民主国断绝对佛朗哥西班牙的邦交。
