Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Tokyo dispatch: The Asahi Shimbun published on the 18th a statement from the Japanese Communist Party regarding the Yoshida government's promulgation of the Labor Relations Adjustment Law. The JCP's statement said that the Yoshida government is a representative of capitalist and landlord groups. It also stated: "As the strike movement of the working class and the peasant's resistance to the government become increasingly tense, the government has rapidly passed the Labor Relations Adjustment Law, which shows that the government intends to use high-pressure means to suppress the people's rights in all developments." The statement called on workers to "fight against the government's formulation of this unreasonable policy of oppression." At the same time, the National Federation of Industrial Organizations also issued a statement opposing the Yoshida government's Labor Relations Adjustment Law, believing that the purpose of this law is to suppress trade union organizations. It stated: "The industrial unions joining the National Federation of Industrial Organizations will persist in the struggle against mass layoffs of workers, demand the establishment of a minimum wage, implement an eight-hour work system, and implement collective bargaining." Finally, the National Federation of Industrial Organizations called on workers across the country to unite to oppose the Yoshida government's reactionary policy of suppressing strikes.

　　日共及产业工联声明反对劳资调整法
    【新华社延安二十一日电】东京讯：朝日新闻十八日刊载日本共产党关于吉田政府颁发劳资调整法的声明。日共声明：吉田政府乃为资本家和地主集团的代表。并说：“政府于工人阶级的罢工运动和农民的反抗政府斗争愈在紧张之时，急速通过了劳资关系调整法案，这说明了政府意欲用高压手段，在一切演变中镇压人民的权利。”该声明号召工人们“为反对政府制定这个毫无理由的压迫政策而奋斗”。与此同时，全国产业工会联盟亦发表声明，反对吉田政府的劳资关系调整法案，认为此法案目的在于镇压工会组织。并称：“加入全国产联的各业工会将坚持斗争，反对大批开除工人，要求确立最低工资，实行八小时工作制，并实行集体议价。”最后，产联要求全国工人团结起来，以反对吉田政府镇压罢工的反动政策。
