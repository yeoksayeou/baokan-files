　　Sharp Internal Contradictions within the Chiang Army
    American Training Proves Useless
    [Report from the Jiluyu Frontline Reporter Corps, 21st of this month] According to Li Zhiqiang, an Upper Lieutenant Secretary and Jiang Quanmou, an Upper Lieutenant Company Commander from the 32nd Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the 11th Division, a direct line unit of Chiang Kai-shek's forces that laid down their arms at Zhangfengji, Juye, the 11th Division is Chen Cheng's core force, originally stationed in Wuhan. When Chiang Kai-shek transferred the 11th Division to attack the Liberated Areas, Chen Cheng, in order to preserve his own strength, jointly requested a change of assignment with Guo Yi, the Wuhan Garrison Commander (Chen was the Commander of the 18th Army, formerly the 11th Division, and Guo was the Chief of Staff). He emphasized that "Wuhan is a city of restoration and must be defended by the strongest troops," but was opposed by Bai Chongxi. Bai once questioned Chen Cheng face to face, "Your division receives more pay than three divisions, why do you avoid going to war?" The argument was very intense, and it even reached Chiang Kai-shek and Marshall. All officers of the 11th Division had heard about it. The division was one of the first units to be equipped with American weaponry. From mid-January to the end of February this year, officers above the Deputy Platoon Leader level were concentrated in Changde, Hunan, and personally trained by Americans. Li Zhiqiang was in charge of managing meals in the training class, while Upper Lieutenant Company Commander Jiang Quanmou, He Jinzhang, Middle Lieutenant Platoon Leader Pan Shouyi, and Junior Lieutenant Deputy Platoon Leader Yin Jixiang, among others, were trained in the class. However, they lamented, "The American tactics mainly focus on using firepower to destroy the defending army's positions and kill the enemy. The infantry's task is to scout and discover the enemy before the battle and to mop up the remnants of the enemy after the battle. Therefore, it is stipulated that the number of soldiers wounded or killed in each company during each battle should not exceed twelve, and there is no accountability for the loss of weapons or even heavy weapons, which are immediately replenished. Under this kind of training by the cowardly Americans, the 11th Division has completely lost its attacking spirit. The disastrous defeat of the main force, the 35th Regiment, at Zhangfengji has fully proven this point."

　　蒋军内部矛盾尖锐
    美国训练也不管用
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二十一日电】据此次在巨野张凤集放下武器之蒋嫡系部队，十一师十一旅三二团上尉书记官李志强及上尉连长蒋全谋等谈称：十一师系陈诚的基本队伍，原在武汉驻防，当蒋介石调十一师进攻解放区时，陈诚为保全自己的实力，曾与武汉警备司令郭毅（十一师前为十八军，陈任军长，郭任参谋长）联名请求改调。他强调“武汉为一复兴之城市，必须有最坚强之部队防守”，但遭白崇禧反对，白曾当面质问陈诚：“你一个师比三个师的饷还多，为什么作战时避而不去？”争吵甚为激烈，一直闹到蒋介石与马歇尔处，十一师官佐俱有所风闻。该师为美械化最早的部队之一，今年一月中旬至二月底止，在湖南常德集中副排长以上的官长，由美国人亲自训练。李志强在该训练班管理伙食，而上尉连长蒋全谋、何金张、中尉排长潘守仪，少尉副排长银吉祥等曾在该班受训，但渠感慨声称：“美国人的战术主要是在火力摧毁守军阵地与杀伤敌人，步兵之任务，在于战斗前搜索与发现敌人，战斗后肃清残敌。故规定每次战斗中，每连伤亡之士兵不得超过十二人，而损失武器以至重武器者则毫不追究，立即予以补充。在怕死的美国人此种训练下，十一师的攻击精神丧失无余。主力三五团在张凤集之惨败，已充分证明了这一点。
