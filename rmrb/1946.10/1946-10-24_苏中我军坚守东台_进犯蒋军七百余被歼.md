Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong, 21st: The Chiang troops, who have been continuously invading Dongtai, were still being blocked by the New Fourth Army at the Fuan position, 50 li south of Dongtai, as of the evening of the 17th. In five days, more than 700 Chiang troops were annihilated. The 65th Division of the Chiang army, which occupied Haian, launched a northern invasion with three regiments at dawn on the 13th. On the same day, at Yijiaji, it was attacked by a unit of the New Fourth Army, resulting in over 300 casualties. On the 14th and 15th, they continued to attack in succession via frontal and flanking routes but were repelled. On the 16th, they resumed their fierce attacks with the support of aircraft but were met with heroic counterattacks by the New Fourth Army, which inflicted another 200 casualties, causing them to flee in disarray. On the morning of the 17th, the Chiang army launched a fierce attack on the defending army's position with small cannons and rocket launchers for four hours, firing over a thousand shells. At noon, they launched an assault under the cover of two aircraft but still could not cross the Fuan River. In the afternoon, the New Fourth Army retaliated with heavy artillery, destroying one of the Chiang army's command posts and recovering the Chiang army strongholds of Huangjinba and Miaonan (south of the Fuan River), killing or wounding 200 Chiang troops. In this battle, the ratio of New Fourth Army casualties to Chiang army casualties was 1 to 30.

    进犯蒋军七百余被歼
    【新华社苏中廿一日电】东台连续进犯之蒋军，战至十七日晚止，仍被新四军阻遏于东台南五十华里之富安阵地。五天中蒋军被歼七百余名。侵占海安蒋军六十五师以三个团兵力于十三日拂晓北犯，当日于议家集遭新四军某部杀伤其三百余。十四十五两日又连续以正面及迂回分路续犯，均被击退。十六日复以飞机配合继续猛犯，遭新四军英勇反击，又伤亡二百余，狼狈溃退。十七日晨蒋军更以小炮火箭筒向守军阵地猛击四小时，发炮千余发，至中午更以飞机两架掩护冲锋，仍未能越过富安河一步。下午新四军以重炮反击，毁蒋军指挥所一处，收复黄金坝、庙南（富安河以南）两蒋军据点，毙伤蒋军二百名。是役新四军伤亡数与蒋军伤亡为一与三十之比。
