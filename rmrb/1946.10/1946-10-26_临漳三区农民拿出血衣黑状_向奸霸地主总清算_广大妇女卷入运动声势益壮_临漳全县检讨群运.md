[Reported by this newspaper from Linzhang] The peasant emancipation movement in the Third District here, after a heated struggle against traitors, has now entered the stage of thorough reckoning and complete implementation of "Land to the Tiller." The main tide of the movement is sweeping from north to south towards the vast areas along the Zhang River. Farmers who have long lived under the rule of bandit gangs and traitorous bullies along the Zhang River are taking out blood-stained clothes, accusations, and other evidence to launch a general reckoning against treacherous landlords. The masses in villages such as Zhangliji and Nandongfang, who have a tradition of fighting against the bandit Guo Qing, quickly united with the help of the emancipation teams to settle accounts with the executioners who suppressed the peasants, such as the despotic landlords Zhang Zhaoguang and Zhu Guangliang. Thousands of farmers, armed with red-tasseled spears, hoes, rakes, and sledgehammers, overturned the "Merit Monuments" erected by the feudal rulers to commemorate their suppression of the peasants. The fierce assault by the peasant masses in Nandongfang completely disintegrated the feudal ruling center in the Third District, led by Duan Laodazi. Well-known gunmen confessed their crimes to the people and surrendered their weapons. The peasants recovered a total of 6,748 mu of land, 621 rooms, 180,991.100 yuan, 260 shi of grain, and 21,962 jin of cotton. In Dashan Village, more than ten wealthy middle peasants also participated in the struggle during the reckoning of landlords and treacherous bullies who had shifted burdens onto others, and 87 percent of the masses received gains. Villages such as Beidongfang and Xiaochengzhai emphasized breaking the limitations of households, stating that whoever participates in the movement can receive benefits. This drew the broad masses of women into the movement, further increasing the momentum of the peasant emancipation movement. Many villages in Dashan Village and Haoxinzhuang requested at the emancipation review meetings to send emancipation teams out of the villages to help their poor brothers in the border areas to emancipate themselves.

[Reported by this newspaper from Weixian] At the end of September, Linzhang held a county-wide cadre meeting to review the three-month mass movement. Although more than 50 villages in the county were mobilized, the scale of the entire movement was still far from sufficient. The shortcomings in leadership were: 1. In the anti-traitor movement, the concerns of the masses were not dispelled, and the old Baozhangs who were still sending things to the puppet troops and die-hards were not resolutely suppressed. The hasty release of special agents put great pressure on the masses' enthusiasm for fighting traitors. 2. Not being bold enough: more criticism than encouragement for lower-level cadres, and no guidance on direction or methods. Some cadres reflected, "If I don't manage, I see there are problems. If I manage, I'm afraid of being accused of taking over and being criticized." 3. Mechanical execution of work steps. Some masses requested to redeem land, but the leadership told the masses to wait until everyone was ready before taking action. 4. Lack of unified pace between the emancipation teams and the local cadres. Some of the cadres in this county have not been organized into the movement. After review, it was proposed to be bold and let go, resolutely crack down on special agents, suppress evil forces, lift the restrictions on the masses, and unify organizational forces. The main leaders of each emancipation team should participate in the county party committee, with duties and powers, and be uniformly led by the county party committee. Emancipation team cadres and local cadres in this county should be mixed and reorganized. All agencies in this county, except for a very small number of people designated to be responsible for agency work, should participate in the mass movement to quickly implement "Land to the Tiller."

　　临漳三区农民拿出血衣黑状
    向奸霸地主总清算
    广大妇女卷入运动声势益壮
    临漳全县检讨群运
    【本报临漳特讯】此间三区农民翻身运动，经过热烈反奸斗争，现已进入彻底清算，全部贯彻“耕者有其田”阶段，运动主潮由北而南卷向漳河沿岸广大地区。长期生活在土匪局子、汉奸恶霸统治下，漳河沿岸的农民们，纷纷拿出血衣黑状等证件向奸霸地主展开总清算。有着反土匪郭清斗争传统的章里集、南东坊等村群众，在翻身队帮助下，迅速团结起来，向镇压农民的刽子手张兆广、祝广良等恶霸地主算账。千百个农民拿着红缨枪、锄、耙、铁锤，把封建统治者因镇压农民而有的标志“功德碑”掀倒了。南东坊农民群众猛烈冲击，使三区以段老达子为首的封建统治中心全部瓦解，著名的黑枪手纷纷向人民坦白卸罪，农民共清算回土地六七四八亩，房子六二一间，钱一八○九九一·一○○元，粮食二六○石，花二一九六二斤。大善村在清算地主奸霸转嫁负担中，十多家富中农也参加斗争，百分之八十七的群众分得果实。北东坊肖城寨等村强调打破以户为单位的限制，谁参加运动，谁就能分果实，使广大妇女卷入运动，农民翻身运动的声势益加壮大，大善村、郝辛庄许多村子，在翻身检查会上纷纷要求随翻身队出村帮助边地穷弟兄翻身。

    【本报威县讯】九月底临漳开全县干部会，检查三个月群运。全县虽有五十多个村动起来，但从整个运动的规模看来，还非常不够。领导上的缺点是：一、在反奸运动中，没打破群众的顾虑，对仍给伪顽军送东西的旧保长没有坚决镇压。处理特务时轻率释放而给群众反奸热情很大压力。二、放不开手：对下级干部批评多鼓励少，不给指示方向办法。有些干部反映“不管吧！看着有问题，管吧，怕包办怕批评。”三、机械的执行工作步骤，有些群众要求赎地，领导上则让群众等齐再动。四、翻身队与本地干部步调不统一，本县干部还有部分未组织到运动中去。经检讨除提出大胆放手，坚决打击特务镇压邪气，解除群众束缚，并统一组织力量，各翻身队的主要负责人参加县委会，有职有权，统一由县委会领导，翻身队干部与本县干部混合编组。本县各机关，除指定极少数人员负责机关工作外，其余一律参加群众运动，迅速贯彻“耕者有其田”。
