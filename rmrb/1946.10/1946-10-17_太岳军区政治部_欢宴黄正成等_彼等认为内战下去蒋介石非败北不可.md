　　Taiyue Military Region Political Department
    Hosts Banquet for Huang Zhengcheng and Others
    They Believe Chiang Kai-shek Will Inevitably Be Defeated If the Civil War Continues
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 13th] Yesterday, the Political Department of the Taiyue Military Region hosted a banquet to entertain senior Chiang-Yan army officers who had just arrived at the military region's headquarters after being liberated in the Linfen Campaign in the central section of the Tongpu Railway. These included Lieutenant General Huang Zhengcheng, commander of the First Brigade; Major General Dai Tao, chief of staff; Colonel Gu Long, chief of staff; Colonel Liu Yushu, commander of the First Regiment; Colonel Zhao Puquan, commander of the 51st Regiment of the 38th Division; Colonel Liu Yongchang, chief of staff of the 39th Division; Colonel Chen Pinzhen, chief of staff of the 64th Division; Colonel Wang Shaowen, commander of the Huoyong Regiment Management District; Colonel Wang Yuzhen, chairman of the Progressive Committee's Hebei Branch; Lieutenant Colonel Liang Zangwei, deputy commander of the 92nd Regiment of the 31st Brigade, totaling twelve people. Also invited were Lieutenant Colonel Yang Yanhua, chief of the Intelligence Section of the 47th Army, who voluntarily withdrew from the civil war to the Liberated Area, and Major General Wu Deming, chief of staff of the local Fen'nan forces, who laid down their arms when we liberated Wenxi, as honored guests. Colonel Wang Shaowen and Major General Wu Deming were old friends of many years, and were very pleasantly surprised to meet. Colonel Wang Shaowen said that Yan Xishan had announced that Major General Wu Deming had been killed by the Eighth Route Army. Major General Wu said with a smile, "The Kuomintang specializes in spreading rumors and creating trouble. Not only am I alive, but I am also having dinner with you all." During the banquet, the Chiang-Yan army officers who had been liberated praised the Liberated Areas. Lieutenant Colonel Liang Zangwei said, "The Eighth Route Army operates quickly and flexibly, has high morale, and has a high level of political awareness. Using American rocket launchers against the Eighth Route Army is ineffective." Talking about the current situation, Major General Dai Tao believes that if the civil war continues, Chiang Kai-shek will inevitably be defeated.
