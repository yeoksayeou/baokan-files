Anti-Sovietism is Just a Smoke Screen
*Liberation Daily* Editorial on the 7th

Following in Hitler's footsteps after the end of World War II, American monopoly capital has been trying to build an empire to rule the world. Hitler's great empire is dead, and Hitler's great empire plan has failed shamefully, but American reactionaries are trying to mold themselves in Hitler's image.

Hitler destroyed the countries of continental Europe and seriously damaged, even almost destroyed, the British Empire before he truly launched his anti-Soviet war; and the Japanese militarists, after occupying large areas of China and all the British and American colonies in the Far East, did not have time to directly wage war against the Soviet Union. However, as everyone knows, Hitler and his partner, the Japanese militarists, used the slogan of anti-Sovietism as a pretext for annexing many nations and invading the world. Now, American reactionaries are similarly using the slogan of anti-Sovietism as a smoke screen to oppress the world. American reactionaries are expanding their power in the capitalist world, preparing to turn capitalist countries outside the United States into appendages of American imperialism, and at the same time preparing to turn the original colonies and semi-colonies of capitalist countries into colonies exclusively occupied by the United States. An American reactionary once wrote without reservation that they "require distant places and foreign countries to become 'friendly' governments (i.e., American puppet governments), send military delegations to various 'friendly' governments to promote and spread the elements of war, maintain intelligence agencies, and use spies to probe for the necessary military, political, and economic information." This shows the ambition of the American reactionaries, who only acknowledge that all nations of the world must live under the bayonets of the American reactionaries, openly denying the right of all nations of the world to independent and free existence. This is the true and actual thing that is currently hidden behind the clamorous voice of anti-Sovietism of the American reactionaries.

The annexation attempts and activities of American reactionaries are becoming increasingly active in the capitalist world. The nations originally oppressed by it are oppressed even more heavily, and many nations that were not originally directly oppressed by it are now being oppressed by American reactionaries as much as possible. The "independence" of the Philippines is the most ridiculous irony. Now they are planning some kind of "US-Philippines defense" there. A Chinese newspaper asked a very good question in its headline: "Defending against' what?" Originally, it was very, very far away from the Soviet Union, and Britain was not preparing to occupy "US-Philippines." What is being defended against is none other than the Philippine nation, the Philippine people. Such "independence" can probably only be compared in history to the "Manchukuo" under Japanese rule. China, this great nation, after eight years of bloody war, drove out Japanese imperialism, but American imperialism has come again. American reactionaries want to turn China into the economic and military boundary of the United States in the Far East. Therefore, with the qualifications of an "ally," they want to bestow Philippine-style "independence," "peace," and "democracy" upon the Republic of China through the hands of Chiang Kai-shek. American reactionaries have obtained bases for the army, navy, and air force in China from Chiang Kai-shek and have also taken control of Chiang Kai-shek's government's military, political, financial, and economic power. When a nation is in this situation, it shows that it is no longer independent but is being colonized by the United States, advancing to the position of establishing American inferior conquerors. American reactionaries want to protect Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship and rely on Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the Chinese people's national consciousness and democratic forces. Therefore, they have supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of materials and military supplies to fight a civil war, preventing the Chinese people from establishing their peaceful and democratic lives. The American reactionaries' destruction of China's national independence, peace, and democracy is also being carried out under the smoke screen of anti-Sovietism. However, what the United States is oppressing here are the Chinese people, not the Soviet people.

The American reactionaries say: "The Soviet Union intends to control China." The American reactionaries believe that as long as they say this, they will have a "reason" to turn China into an affiliated country and colony of the United States. The American reactionaries... (missing thirty-odd characters, will be corrected later) (United Press International, Washington, September 21, the remarks of some members of the Far East Inspection Team of the Military Committee of the US House of Representatives). The American reactionaries believe that as long as they say this, they will have a "reason" to help Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and civil war. However, any Chinese people who hear these words will know that the people who say these words are completely imperialist swindlers and merchants of war! Based on their own personal experience, the Chinese people know that the people who are now oppressing the Chinese people, fanning the flames of the Chinese civil war, and causing suffering to the Chinese people are the American reactionaries. The Chinese people can see that in the Chinese liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party, there are no Soviet troops, no Soviet military bases, no Soviet military delegations, no Soviet representatives controlling military, political, financial, and economic power, no Soviet goods destroying China's national free industry, and no Soviet materials and military supplies being imported for the civil war. What there is here is only the Chinese people being the masters of their own land, and the self-reliance of the liberated Chinese people. As for Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area, it is completely different. The American reactionaries occupy everything there and wield the greatest power. If it were not for these various aggressive actions of the United States, China would have had true independence, peace, and democracy long ago.

Many Americans will understand the tricks of the American reactionaries to destroy China under the smoke screen of anti-Sovietism. The famous American journalist Snow once said: "We are 16,000 kilometers away from China, and adopting the methods used by Japan to invade China and the Nazis in Europe to establish a unilateral alliance is basically denying China's autonomy and independence." These words are very correct and show the conscience of righteous Americans. The Chinese people do not want to be slaves of the Japanese militarists, nor can they be slaves of American monopoly capital. Because American reactionaries want to rule the world, not only the Chinese nation, but we believe that all nations that have fought for liberation and participated in this anti-fascist war will certainly not bow down under the oppression of American reactionaries. They will all, like the Chinese people, continue to rise up in struggle, converge into a revolutionary torrent, to break free from the chains of the American reactionaries and avoid the current fate of new slaves.

If American reactionaries do not stop their aggression, change their policies, and continue to use the old tune of Hitler and the Japanese militarists, boasting that they have atomic bombs, weapons, and money to rule the world, then watch! They must and are suffering the opposition of all mankind, and the path of failure of Hitler and the Japanese militarists will be the path that American reactionaries must take!

### 反苏不过是烟幕  解放日报七日社论

　　反苏不过是烟幕
    解放日报七日社论
    在第二次世界大战结束之后，美国独占资本跟着希特勒的后尘，千方百计准备建立一个统治全世界的帝国。希特勒的大帝国是死亡了，希特勒的大帝国计划是最无耻的破产了，但是美国反动派却要按照希特勒的样子来装塑它自己。
    希特勒灭亡欧洲大陆各国，并严重地打击了以至几乎毁灭了大英帝国，这是在他真正举行反苏战争之前；而日本军阀侵占了大片中国和远东的一切英美殖民地之后，并没有来得及直接进行反苏的战争。但是，大家知道，希特勒及其伙伴日本军阀，都曾用反苏的口号作为吞并许多民族和侵略全世界的托辞，现在美国反动派同样地以反苏的口号作为压迫世界的烟幕。美国反动派在向着资本主义世界扩张自己的势力，一方面准备把美国以外的资本主义国家都变成美国帝国主义的附属物，一方面准备把资本主义各国原来的殖民地和半殖民地都变成美国独占的殖民地。有一个美国反动派曾经毫无忌惮地写道：他们“要求遥远的地方和外国成为‘友好’政府（按即美国傀儡政府），以军事代表团到各‘友好’政府去倡导和散布战争的因素，维持情报机关，用间谍刺探所需要的军政经济消息。”这是表现了美国反动派的野心勃勃，他们仅仅承认世界各民族必须在美国反动派的刺刀下生活，公开否定了世界各民族的独立自由生存的权利。这是目前美国反动派藏在反苏的叫嚣声音后面的真正实际的东西。
    美国反动派在资本主义世界中，这一切吞并的企图与活动日趋积极，原来是被它压迫的民族就被压迫得更重，原来还不是受它直接压迫的许多民族，美国反动派正在尽量给以压迫。菲律宾的“独立”，这是最滑稽的讽刺，现在那里在计划什么“美菲防御”了。有一个中国报纸的标题问得很好：“‘防御’什么？”原来那里离开苏联很远很远，而英国也没有准备去占领“美菲”，所防御的不是别的，正是菲律宾的民族，菲律宾的人民。这样的“独立”，在历史上大概是只有日寇统治下的“满洲国”可以和它比拟的。中国这个伟大的民族，经过八年流血的战争，赶走了日本帝国主义，但是美国帝国主义又来了。美国反动派要把中国变成美国在远东的经济边界与军事边界，于是就以“盟国”的资格，要把菲律宾式的“独立”、“和平”与“民主”，经过蒋介石之手赐给中华民国。美国反动派从蒋介石的手里，得到了陆海空军在中国的基地，又掌握了蒋介石政府的军事、政治、财政、经济的大权。一个民族处在这种情形下面，就说明了它已经不是独立的，而是美国的殖民地化进到建立美国劣种征服者的地位；美国反动派就要保护蒋介石的法西斯独裁，依靠蒋介石去镇压中国人民的民族自觉性和民主力量，于是以大量物资与军火供给了蒋介石打内战，使中国人民不得建立其和平与民主的生活。美国反动派这样破坏中国民族的独立和平与民主，也是在反苏的烟幕之下进行的。但是，美国在这里所压迫的是中国人，并不是苏联人。
    美国反动派说：“苏联拟欲控制中国”，美国反动派认为只要他们这么一说，也就有“理由”把中国变成美国的附属国与殖民地。美国反动派…………（中缺三十余字容后补正）（合众社华盛顿九月二十一日电所载美国众议院军事委员会远东考察团若干委员之谈话）。美国反动派认为只要他们这么一说，也就有“理由”帮助蒋介石独裁与内战。但是，任何中国人民听了这些话之后，都会知道说这种话的人，完全是帝国主义的骗子，战争的贩子！中国人民根据自己切身的经验，知道现在压在中国人民头上者，煽动中国内战之火、使中国人民受痛苦者，乃是美国反动派。中国人民看得见在中国共产党所领导的中国解放区，没有什么苏联的军队，没有什么苏联的军事基地，没有什么苏联的军事代表团，没有什么苏联代表掌握军事、政治、财政、经济的大权，没有什么苏联货摧毁中国的民族自由工业，没有什么苏联输进内战的物资与军火；这里仅仅有的，乃是中国人民做了自己土地上的主人翁，乃是解放了的中国人的自力更生。至于在蒋介石的统治区，却完全是另一样，美国反动派在那里占了一切，摆着最大的权力，而如果没有美国这种种侵略的行动，中国全国就已有了真正的独立和平与民主。
    很多美国人会懂得美国反动派这类在反苏烟幕下灭亡中国的把戏，美国名记者史诺曾说过：“我们与中国相距一万六千公里，采用日本侵略中国、纳粹在欧洲所使用过的办法，建立单方面的联盟，基本上是否认中国的自主与独立。”这些话说得很对，并表现了有正义感的美国人的良心。中国人民不愿为日本军阀的奴隶，便也不能为美国独占资本的奴隶。由于美国反动派想统治全世界，不独中国民族，我们相信历来为解放而斗争、并参加这次反法西斯大战的一切民族，都一定不会在美国反动派的压迫之下低首下心，他们都会像中国人民一样，再接再厉地起来斗争，汇合成革命的巨流，以摆脱美国反动派的锁炼，避免当前新的奴隶的命运。
    美国反动派如果不中止自己的侵略，改变自己的政策，而且继续利用希特勒和日本军阀的老调子，夸耀自己有原子弹、有军火、有金钱，以求统治全世界，那末，看吧！它一定要、并且正在遭受全世界人类的反对，而希特勒与日本军阀失败的道路，便将是美国反动派必走的道路！
