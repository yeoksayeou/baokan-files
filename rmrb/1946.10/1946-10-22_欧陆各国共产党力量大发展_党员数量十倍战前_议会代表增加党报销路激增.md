Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to the recent World News and Commentary magazine (June 8th), the strength of the Communist Parties in some European countries is developing vigorously, with the number of party members in many countries being ten times that of pre-war levels. The Belgian Communist Party had only 10,000 members in 1939, but now has 100,000 members; in 1939 it had only nine members of parliament, now it has twenty-three; the party newspaper sold only 10,000 copies in 1939, but now sells 110,000 copies. As of June, it had four cabinet members in the current government. The Finnish Communist Party had only 2,000 members in 1939, now it has 27,000 to 28,000 members; in 1939 it had no representatives in parliament, now it has forty-one; the party newspaper sells 150,000 copies daily. The Norwegian Communist Party had only 3,000 to 4,000 members in 1939, now it has 33,000; it had no representatives in parliament before the war, now it has eleven; the party newspaper (evening edition) sells 50,000 copies daily. The Danish Communist Party had only 6,000 members before the war, now it has 60,000; the party newspaper had a daily circulation of 6,000 copies before the war, now it is 50,000; the Danish Communist Party also publishes five weekly magazines with a total circulation of 50,000 copies per issue; in 1939 it had no representatives in parliament, now it has eighteen. The Dutch Communist Party had only 9,000 members before the war, now it has 45,000 to 50,000 members; in 1939 it had three members in the House of Representatives, now it has ten (one-tenth); in the recent provincial elections, it received 11 percent of the vote; it has five members in the Senate (one-tenth); the party newspaper has a daily circulation of 250,000 copies. The Swedish Communist Party had 11,000 members in 1940, 22,000 in 1944, and 48,000 in 1945. The Icelandic Communist Party has joined the government, its membership was 600 in 1939, and now it is 1,100, the party newspaper has a daily circulation of 4,000 copies. As of June, the Austrian Communist Party had 131,268 members; in 1933 it had only 8,000; the party newspaper sells 450,000 copies.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Santiago Air Mail: The strength of the Chilean Communist Party has greatly increased, and it has leaped into Chile's most powerful true working-class party. At the beginning of this year, the party called for a general strike, which succeeded despite opposition from the Socialist Party. Since the Socialist Party joined the government in February of this year, the Communist Party's prestige among the masses has increased. In the nationwide trade union committee elections held in Chile in May of this year, the Communist Party won an overwhelming victory, while the Socialist Party almost disappeared. In the Lota coal mine area, the Communist Party won 5,960 votes, while the Socialist Party won only 96 votes. In the Schwager coal mine area, the score was 3,173 to 13. Not only the coal miners' union, but also the copper and nitrate workers' unions are under the control of the Communist Party. In the north, the strength of the Communist Party is even greater. Reactionaries in the Portales factory attempted to prevent communists from being elected, but the workers there still elected three communists, while the Socialist Party and the Radical Party each had only one elected. Currently, the ratio of strength between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the Chilean Labor Federation has changed from 60 to 40 in the past to 80 to 20.
