　　Bianfu Yang and Rong, Chairman and Vice-Chairman, Congratulate Taiyue Column on Victory at Fushan
　　[Our newspaper, Handan, 15th dispatch] Yang and Rong, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of Bianfu, recently sent a telegram to congratulate the Taiyue Column on the great victory at Fushan. The original telegram is as follows:
　　"To Commander Chen, Political Commissar Xie, Deputy Commander Han, Deputy Political Commissar Yang, and all the commanders and fighters of the Taiyue Column comrades: We are delighted to hear that the entire elite First Division of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line, Hu Zongnan, was completely annihilated by our army in the outer area of Fushan. The good news has excited the entire region. The inevitable failure of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army, relying on the new weapons given by American imperialism, to slaughter the people, and the inevitable victory of our army and people's patriotic self-defense war, have been proven again by this great victory. In addition to mobilizing the people and administrative cadres in the entire region to fully support the front lines, this government hereby sends a congratulatory telegram and pays its highest respects! Yang Xiufeng and Rong Wusheng, Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region."

    【本报邯郸十五日电】边府杨、戎正副主席顷特电贺太岳纵队浮山大捷，原电如下：
    “陈司令员谢政委韩副司令员杨副政委并转太岳纵队全体指战员同志：欣闻蒋军嫡系胡宗南精锐第一师全部，在浮山外围被我军全部歼灭，捷报传来，全区振奋。蒋介石反动军队依靠美国帝国主义所给予之新式武器，屠杀人民，其最后结果之必然失败与我军民爱国自卫战争之必然胜利，由此次大捷中又得到证明。本府除动员全区人民及行政干部以全力支援前线外，谨此电贺，并致崇高敬礼！晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨秀峰戎伍胜酉支”。
