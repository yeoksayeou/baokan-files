The Central Bureau recently convened a war mobilization inspection meeting in five counties and cities along the Pinghan Railway, including Ci and Han, to effectively carry out comprehensive resistance. The meeting inspected and summarized the land reform, militia construction, and cadres' understanding of comprehensive resistance, and the thorough liquidation of peace illusions in these areas. This meeting is of great significance in promoting the work on the Pinghan Line. These areas were liberated by the Communist Party from the corrupt and long-term feudal oppression of the Kuomintang and from the eight-year rule and enslavement of the Japanese invaders and puppet troops. In the past year, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the masses were mobilized to implement land reform and realize "land to the tiller." Thousands of years of feudal oppression were overthrown in one fell swoop, completing the basic tasks of the New Democratic Revolution. The appearance of the countryside has been completely renewed. In a certain county, the emancipated peasants obtained more than 8,000 long and short guns from reactionary landlords and other sources, arming themselves. In certain other counties, each county has 11-12 thousand militiamen, 6-7 thousand guns, as well as machine guns and small cannons, which is more than the personnel and guns of a Kuomintang army corps. In many places, every militiaman has a gun, with their own headquarters and joint defense organizations. Some places have even established military factories, manufacturing large quantities of landmines and hand grenades. They have also established militia hospitals. This is already a large, well-equipped, organized, and conscious peasant army. Wherever "land to the tiller" has been thoroughly realized, the masses generally demand armed protection of their homes and defense of their fruits of victory. They have a high degree of awareness of the need for armed defense, putting forward the slogan "Arm everyone, men, women, old and young, all participate." They consciously follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They say: "The road pointed out by Chairman Mao is the road we must take." They have carried out effective armed struggles against traitors and spies, eliminating and continuing to eliminate hidden and overt spies—the landlord "Home-Returning Legions." They have universally launched a heated movement to join the People's Liberation Army. Two counties completed 150% to 170% of their conscription tasks in just five to seven days. After realizing "land to the tiller," they are preparing for winter production and preparing for large-scale production next year to develop the national economy and guarantee supplies for the long-term war. Their production enthusiasm is extremely high. All of this far exceeds the scale of any year during the Anti-Japanese War.

The experiences of our regions prove that wherever we resolutely mobilize the masses, realize "land to the tiller," and liberate the peasants, we have the most solid foundation for defeating the reactionary forces of the US and Chiang Kai-shek. They can be fully competent in conscription, participation in war, material supply, and tireless and arduous support to the front lines, and they can withstand severe tests and support arduous struggles. In the future, in places where the masses have not been mobilized and the land problem has not been thoroughly resolved, we must continue to mobilize the masses to realize "land to the tiller" during war mobilization. It must be recognized that only by thoroughly mobilizing the masses and realizing "land to the tiller" can we guarantee the replenishment of troops and material supplies, and effectively support a long-term war. The view of some comrades that opposes realizing "land to the tiller" to war mobilization work is obviously wrong.

Since last month, the US and Chiang Kai-shek have been singing the praises of peace on the one hand, deceiving the masses; on the other hand, they are actively attacking the Liberated Areas and the people's democratic forces, attempting to force the Communist Party and the people's democratic forces to sell out the interests of the Chinese people and surrender to US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. During this period, based on their own experience, the majority of the Chinese people have realized that the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek are the culprits of the civil war and the heads of the traitors. He launched a full-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas and the people's democratic forces, determined to sell out China in exchange for becoming a US puppet emperor, and has no sincerity for peace whatsoever. They also recognize that US mediation is nothing more than a trick, and Marshall is the trickster who designed this trick. He is determined to turn China into a colony of US imperialism, a second Philippines. The US and Chiang Kai-shek's cooperation is aimed at strangling the independence, democracy, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. The Chinese nation and the Chinese people will not be free and will not live unless they fight; they will become slaves of a vanquished nation. Due to US imperialism's policy of helping Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war and colonizing China, and also due to the unprecedented growth of the Communist Party of China and the people's democratic forces, the protracted and cruel nature of the civil war has been determined. This fact, this truth, should be openly told to the masses, and propaganda and education should be carried out among the masses so that the masses are mentally and ideologically prepared. It is wrong not to propagate this. We should call on the masses to use the same methods they used to deal with Japanese imperialism and the traitor Wang Jingwei to deal with the US imperialists and their running dog, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Once we and the masses have liquidated peace illusions and recognized the hideous faces of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, we can infinitely unleash our favorable conditions and achieve victory in comprehensive resistance.

The war is long-term and cruel, so there must be a long-term way to fight it. This should be told to the masses about our method of combat. Our party's policy is to concentrate superior forces and annihilate the enemy's effective strength. In the past three months of the war, our region has annihilated ten brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's army under the execution of this policy (a total of twenty-five brigades have been eliminated nationwide). In the future, we must annihilate more of the enemy's effective strength. When we eliminate to a certain extent, we will launch a large-scale counter-offensive and recover all lost territory. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's army, for the sake of victory, our main force must be concentrated and used flexibly. Therefore, the temporary gains and losses of certain cities are entirely possible. The reactionaries temporarily occupy these cities, which are contained, restrained, and besieged by our militia guerrillas and local corps, preventing them from maneuvering, further prolonging the front line, and forcing them to put out more troops for defense. This weakens the attacking power of Chiang Kai-shek's army and facilitates the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's army by our main force. Recently, we abandoned some towns and cities, such as Heze, Jining, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Jiaozuo, etc. In the future, the reactionaries may also occupy some of our towns and cities. This is certainly a temporary loss to the people of the Liberated Areas, but it is insignificant or even necessary from the perspective of winning the complete victory of comprehensive resistance. This point must be clearly recognized, and there must be mental and ideological preparation. Strive to take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses, give full play to our favorable conditions, fully organize our own forces, resolutely strike the occupiers, and prepare the conditions for finally driving the US-Chiang Kai-shek reactionary army out of the Liberated Areas.

In order to meet the reactionary forces' possible new offensive, the following tasks should also be done well: First, we must strengthen the people's armed forces, organize the county and district cadre teams, the armed work teams, the militia, and the hidden underground army. Weapons must be in the hands of activists who emerge from mass movements. There must be party backbones and cores in various armed forces. Call on and send veteran soldiers and cadres to guerrilla units and militias. We must promote mass leaders to participate in the leadership, strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties with the people, and organically integrate these armed forces into the guerrilla groups of counties, districts, and villages, accepting the leadership and command of the command posts at the county, district, and village levels. Organize joint defense struggles, support each other, promote new heroism, and carry out active and proactive struggles with the reactionary forces to protect the interests of the masses and protect the interests of the masses. Go deep into the enemy's rear and around the reactionary forces' strongholds, strike the enemy's supply lines and transport teams, strike the Home-Returning Legions, strike special agents and traitors, strike small units of the reactionary forces, burn enemy bridges and trestle bridges, lay landmines, etc., and persist in the struggle in the local area and the local district. For this reason, we should seize the time to obtain the necessary rectification and improve our skills; we must do a good job in the anti-espionage struggle. Without claws, the reactionary forces cannot accomplish much. Now the masses have learned the skills and many methods of fighting against special agents. The two main points are: first, unite the majority, isolate and expose a small number of bad elements, and second, educate the masses to be good at implementing lenient policies, let go of efforts to win over coerced elements to turn back, and thoroughly suppress a small number of masterminds, striking at their reactionary armed forces; we must thoroughly empty the houses and clear the fields. All grain and materials should be buried and transferred as soon as possible, stored separately. All fortifications and features that can be used by the reactionary forces for defense should be razed in advance, and transportation tools should be transferred in advance. Conscription-age men and livestock should be properly protected; we must carry out landmine warfare, widely manufacture landmines and stone mines, and cultivate a large number of demolitionists. In places where there is no foundation for landmine warfare, we must be determined to start it. Tunnels can be dug universally in the plains, and caves can be dug in the mountains; and we should prepare to carry out various complex political and economic struggles with the reactionary forces, and add thorough planning to all possible new struggles and propose countermeasures. All of the above is only to achieve one goal: prepare ourselves, give the attackers a blow anytime and anywhere, contain and detain the enemy on points and lines, so that the reactionary forces are trapped in isolated cities, to achieve the persistence of local and regional struggles, so as to protect the lives and property of the masses, and create favorable conditions for our main force to wait for the appropriate opportunity, cooperate with the main force, and recover all lost territory.

We have ample conditions for victory and will ultimately be able to recover all lost territory. But we must understand that the enemy still has strength, and we ourselves still have weaknesses. We must be conscientious, not be arrogant when winning, not be discouraged when losing, and build our victory on the basis of thoroughly completing land reform and liberating all peasants, on the basis of fully supporting the front lines, and constantly maintaining the full strength and morale of the field army, and on the basis of guerrilla units, militias, and local corps going deep into the enemy's rear, constantly striking the enemy, containing the enemy, and protecting the interests of the masses. Make full preparations ideologically and organizationally, and constantly conduct self-examination and improve work to win the victory of comprehensive resistance.

### 随时随地准备给进攻者以打击

　　随时随地准备给进攻者以打击
    中央局为了有效的进行全面抵抗，最近召开了平汉沿线磁邯等五县市的战争动员检查会议，检查并总结了这些地区的土地改革、民兵建设以及干部对全面抵抗的认识、和平幻想的彻底清算等。这一会议、对平汉线工作推动，有极大意义。这些地区，是由共产党领导从腐朽的国民党长期封建压迫下，从日寇伪军八年的统治奴役下解放出来的，一年来又在共产党领导下放手发动群众执行土地改革实现了耕者有其田，数千年来封建压迫，一朝推翻，完成了新民主主义革命的基本任务，农村面貌焕然为之一新，某县一个县翻身的农民，从反动地主手里及其他方面获得长短枪在八千枝以上，武装了自己。某某等县每县均有一万几千民兵，六七千条枪，还有机关枪小炮，比国民党一个军的人枪还多。很多地方作到民兵人手一枪，有自己的指挥部及联防组织，有些地方还成立了军火工厂，自己大量制造地雷手榴弹，还成立了民兵医院，这已经是一枝数量很大装备可观有组织有觉悟的农民大军了。凡是彻底实现了耕者有其田的地方，群众均普遍要求武装保卫家乡，保卫胜利果实，对武装有着高度的觉悟性，提出“人人武装，男女老幼一齐干”的口号；均自觉的跟着共产党走，跟着毛主席走。他们说：“毛主席所指引的道路，就是我们要走的道路；他们与汉奸特务进行了有效的武装斗争，消灭了并正在继续消灭着暗藏特务和公开特务——地主还乡团；他们普遍的展开了参加人民解放军的热烈运动，有两个县仅五天到七天的时间，就完成了参军任务百分之一百五十到一百七十；他们在实现了耕者有其田以后，正在准备冬季生产，并准备明年的大生产，以便发展国民经济，保障长期战争的供给，生产情绪极高；所有这些，均远超过抗日战争时期任何一年的规模。
    我区各地经验证明：凡坚决发动群众，实现耕者有其田，解放了农民的地方，我们就有了战胜美蒋反动派的最坚实的基础，参军参战，物质供给，以及不疲倦的艰苦支援前线，均能胜任裕如，就能经得起严重考验和支持艰苦斗争。今后凡是没有发动群众，彻底解决土地问题的地方，在战争动员时，必须继续发动群众实现耕者有其田，要在实现耕者有其田的基础上，进行战争动员工作。必须认识，只有彻底发动群众，实现了耕者有其田，才能保证兵员补充和物质供给，才能有效的支持长期战争。有些同志，把实现耕者有其田和战争动员工作对立起来的看法，显然是不对的。
    上个月以来，美蒋一面高唱和平，实行欺骗群众；一面则积极向解放区和人民民主力量进攻；企图压迫共产党和人民民主力量出卖中国人民利益投降美帝国主义和蒋介石。在这一期间，中国人民根据自己的经验，大部分已认识到国民党蒋介石是内战祸首，是汉奸头子，他发动了全面进攻解放区，进攻人民民主力量，决心出卖中国，换取做美国的儿皇帝，毫无和平诚意可言。也认识到美国的调解，不过是一个骗局，而马歇尔就是设计这个骗局的骗子，他决心把中国变成美帝国主义的殖民地，菲律滨第二。美蒋合作，就是要绞杀中华民族中国人民的独立、民主、自由与解放，中华民族中国人民不斗争就不得自由，不得活命，就要当亡国奴。由于美帝国主义助蒋内战殖民地化中国的政策，也由于中国共产党和人民民主力量的空前壮大，决定了内战的长期性残酷性，应把这一事实，这一真理，公开告诉群众，在群众中进行宣传教育，以便群众在精神上思想上有所准备，不宣传是不对的，号召群众拿出过去对付日本帝国主义汉奸汪精卫的办法，来对付美帝国主义者及其走狗卖国贼蒋介石。当我们和群众一起，一旦清算了和平幻想，认清了美帝国主义和蒋介石狰狞面目之后，我们就能无限的发挥我们的有利条件，取得全面抵抗的胜利。
    战争是长期的残酷的，就必须有个长期的打法。这就应该将我们的作战方法告诉群众，我党的方针是集中优势兵力，歼灭敌人的有生力量。过去三个月的战争，我区在执行这个方针下，消灭蒋军有生力量十个旅（全国则消灭共二十五个旅），今后要更多的消灭敌人有生力量，消灭到一定程度，我们就会大举反攻，收复一切失地。为了击灭蒋军，为了胜利，我们的主力必须集中机动使用，因此某些城市的暂时得失是完全可能的，反动派暂时占领了这些城市，被我民兵游击队地方兵团牵制束缚围困，不得机动，战线更加延长，迫使它不得不拿出更多的兵力来进行守备，这就减弱了蒋军进攻的力量，便利我主力各个歼灭蒋军。最近我们放弃了一些城镇，如荷泽济宁洪洞赵城焦作等，今后反动派还可能占领我们一些城镇，这对解放区人民暂时固然是一个损失，但从争取全面抵抗的完全胜利，则无足轻重，甚至是必要的，此点必须认识清楚，精神上思想上必须有所准备。努力利用敌之弱点，充分发挥我之优良条件，把自己的力量，充分的组织起来，坚决给占领者以打击，准备好最后驱逐美蒋反动军出解放区的条件。
    为着迎接反动派可能的新进攻，此外还应该作好下列工作：首先要加强人民武装，把县区干队武工队民兵以及隐蔽的地下军组织好，武装必须掌握在群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子手里，各种武装中必须要有党的骨干和核心，号召并派遣老战士和干部到游击队民兵中去，必须提拔群众领袖参加领导，加强与人民的血肉连系，把这些武装有机的组成到县区村的游击集团中去，接受县区村各该级指挥部的领导和指挥，组织联防斗争，互相支援，发扬新英雄主义和反动派进行积极主动的斗争，保卫家乡保护群众的利益，深入到敌后和反动派据点的周围，打击敌人的补给线运输队，打击还乡团，打击特务汉奸，打击反动派的小股部队，烧毁敌人的桥梁栈道，埋设地雷等等，坚持本地本区的斗争。为此应争取时间，获得必要的整训，提高自己的技术；要作好反奸斗争，反动派没有爪牙，就不可能有多大作为，现在群众已学会了与特务作斗争的本领和很多办法，主要的两点，一是团结多数孤立并暴露少数坏分子，一是教育群众善于执行宽大政策，放手争取胁从分子回头，彻底镇压少数主谋分子，打击其反动武装；要彻底空室清野，一切粮食物资应及早埋藏转移，分散贮存，一切可资反动派用于防御的工事地物应先予平毁，运输工具先予转移，对于壮丁和牲畜应妥善保护；要开展地雷战，广泛制造地雷石雷，大量培养爆炸手，没有地雷战基础的地方，一定要下决心搞起来，平原可普遍挖掘地道，山地可挖洞；并应准备和反动派进行政治经济的各种复杂斗争，对一切可能发生的新的斗争，预加周密的策划，提出对策。以上这一切，只是为了达到一个目的：准备好自己，随时随地给进攻者以打击，牵制与抑留敌人在点线上，使反动派困守孤城，达到坚持本地本区斗争，以保护群众的生命财产，为我主力军创造有利条件，等待适当时机，配合主力军，收复一切失地。
    我们是有充分胜利条件的，最后一定能够收复一切失地。但必须了解敌人还有力量，我们自己还有弱点，必须兢兢业业，闻胜不骄，闻败不馁，把我们的胜利建筑在彻底完成土地改革，解放全体农民的基础上，建立在全力支援前线，经常保持野战军的满员，士气旺盛的基础上，建筑在游击队民兵地方兵团深入敌后，不断打击敌人，牵制敌人，保护群众利益的基础上。在思想上组织上作充分准备，并经常进行自我检查，改进工作，以争取全面抵抗的胜利。
