[This newspaper's correspondent] Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 22nd—Our front-line troops, under the constant harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's and U.S. aircraft, are utilizing every war interval to fully assist the local masses in harvesting and planting. The political department of the "Hangzhou Unit" issued instructions on the 10th to all combat troops, urging them to use their rest time between battles to fully mobilize and help the local masses with the autumn harvest and planting. The "Hangzhou" direct subordinate units were the first to respond to the call. Fifty-six cadres and support staff from various departments of the political department went to the fields before dawn on the 11th to harvest soybeans for the masses in groups. Everyone competed with each other, proposing that they should not only be heroic enemy killers on the front lines but also labor heroes who help the masses with production. Tang Pingzhu, the Minister of the Propaganda Department, was covered in sweat. The groom, Lu Tangshun, competed with him, saying, "I will harvest soybeans as fast as you write." They harvested six mu in two sessions with six people. Lu Tangshun also said, "Tomorrow, I will feed the livestock earlier and definitely harvest more mu than today." Various combat troops also separately helped the local masses with harvesting and wheat planting. As soon as the soldiers took off their weapons, they picked up sickles and went to the fields to harvest soybeans. While plowing for the people, they worked and sang songs. The villagers happily said, "The Eighth Route Army is truly the people's army. They have just finished fighting and are helping us harvest soybeans without even taking a rest." They warmly welcomed their helpers, offering them cigarettes, boiling water, and cooking meals, but all these kind intentions were politely declined. Lu Tangshun said, "What we eat and wear all comes from the people, so it is our duty to do some work for you."

　　冀鲁豫前线各部队总动员
    战斗间隙助民收种
    不顾战斗疲劳蒋机袭扰
    杀敌英雄争作劳动英雄
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】我前线部队在蒋美飞机不断袭扰下，利用一切战争间隙，全力帮助驻地群众抢收抢种。“杭州部队”政治部于十号指示各作战部队，利用打仗休息时间，全体动员帮助驻地群众秋收秋种。“杭州”直属队首先响应号召，政治部各部门的干部和杂务人员五十六人，十一日早晨天不明就分组到地里给群众割豆子。大家互相竞赛，提出不但要在前线做杀敌英雄，而且要做帮助群众生产的劳动英雄。宣传部唐平铸部长累的满头大汗，马夫路棠顺和他竞赛说：“我割豆子要像你写字一样快。”他们六个人两晌时间即割了六亩。路棠顺还说：“明天我早点喂饱牲口，一定比今天还要多割几亩。”各战斗部队亦分别帮助驻地群众收割并种麦。战士们刚从肩上卸下武器，就拿起镰刀到地里割豆子。他们在替老百姓拉犁时，一面做活，一面唱歌。老乡们欢天喜地的说：“八路军真是老百姓的队伍，刚打罢仗，连一会也舍不得休息，就帮助俺割豆子。”他们热心的招待着自己的帮忙者，给他们买烟、烧水、做饭，这一切盛意都被婉辞谢绝了。路棠顺说：“我们吃的穿的都是老百姓的，给你们干点活是应该的。”
