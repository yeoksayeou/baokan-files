　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Moscow, 27th - Commentator Marcinow's commentary on current events stated: The Security Council's recent meetings discussed the Soviet representative's August 19th proposal regarding the stationing of Allied forces in non-enemy countries. This issue has great international significance. The presence of US troops in China has, without exaggeration, become an important factor in the entire international situation in the Far East. Everyone knows that the US military is helping the Kuomintang expand the civil war. Chinese democrats have repeatedly demanded the immediate withdrawal of all US troops stationed in China, and democratic organizations and free political groups have launched "US Troops Out of China Week" throughout China. There is no doubt that the withdrawal of US troops from China is a prerequisite for eliminating the Chinese civil war and completing the democratic tasks of the Chinese people.
    Marshal Stalin, in answering the question posed by Mr. Yolt, a reporter from the *Sunday Times*, specifically pointed out that he believes the US withdrawal of all troops stationed in China is urgently needed for peace. Everyone knows that the US government stated in 1945 that the mission of US troops stationed in China was to carry out the surrender of Japanese troops and help repatriate them, but these tasks have long been completed, yet US troops are still stationed in China. Secondly, the US military stationed on islands in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans threatens the security of those countries. The above facts confirm that the stationing of Allied forces in non-enemy countries, as proposed by Soviet representative Gromyko, has a serious impact on the international situation. The Soviet Union not only called for the withdrawal of troops from other friendly countries, but has also set a model itself. The presence of foreign troops in non-enemy countries is an important factor causing tension in international relations, and the withdrawal of foreign troops will make a serious contribution to lasting peace throughout the world.

　　马西努评论称：
    美军撤离中国，是消除内战先决条件。
    【新华社延安廿八日电】莫斯科二十七日广播评论员马西努时事评论略称：安理会最近几次会议曾讨论了苏联代表八月十九日关于盟军驻在非敌国的问题，这个问题具有很大的国际意义。美军驻在中国，决不夸张地说，已变成远东整个国际局势的重要因素。大家知道，美国军队在援助国民党扩大内战。中国民主人士已再三要求马上撤退美国所有驻华军队，在全中国展开了民主组织与自由政治团体所发起的“美军退出中国周”。毫无疑义，美军撤离中国是消除中国内战，完成中国人民民主任务的先决条件。
    斯大林元帅在回答星期泰晤士报记者约尔特所提出的问题时，特别指出他认为美国撤退所有驻中国军队，是对和平所迫切需要的。大家知道美国政府在一九四五年曾声明美军驻华的任务，是执行日军投降帮助遣送日军，可是这些任务早已完成了，然而美军仍旧驻在中国。其次美军驻在太平洋、大西洋、北冰洋各岛屿威胁各该国家的安全。上述事实证实了苏联代表葛罗米柯所提出盟军驻在非敌国境内，对于国际情况发生严重的影响。苏联不仅号召从其他友国撤退驻军，而且自己已作到模范。外国军驻在非敌国是引起国际关系紧张化的重要因素，撤退驻外军队对于全世界长期和平将有严重的贡献。
