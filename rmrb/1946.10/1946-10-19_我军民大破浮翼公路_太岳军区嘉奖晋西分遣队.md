　　Our Army and People Score a Major Victory Damaging the Fuyi Highway
    Taiyue Military Region Commends the Jinxi Detachment
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng, 16th Dispatch] After our army recovered the Fu (Shan) Yi (Cheng) highway, the important highlands such as Zhouzi Mountain, Zhutou Mountain, and Yueshan Ridge in the vicinity of the line were completely under our control. Currently, tens of thousands of people have destroyed more than 40 li of the highway. All fifteen huge bunkers constructed by the Chiang-Yan troops between the Nanzhuang Bridge and Liangjiahe have been demolished. The large bridge at Nanzhuang Bridge has been blown up by the militia. The Chiang army forcibly conscripted laborers from Yicheng several times to repair it, but they were all intercepted by the militia along the way. Currently, the Fushan militia is actively developing guerrilla warfare in connection with the armed forces in Xiangling, Linfen, Yicheng and other places.
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng, 17th Dispatch] The leaders of the Taiyue Military Region were delighted to hear that the local armed forces of the Third Sub-district had launched guerrilla warfare, crushed the Chiang army's three "mopping-up" operations, recovered vast areas behind enemy lines, and achieved brilliant victories. They issued a circular commending Commander Wang Yong, Political Commissar Chai Zemin, all the backbone corps, guerrilla teams, and all comrades of the militia guerrilla groups. The circular stated: Since the Chiang army invaded southern Shanxi, large areas of our Third Sub-district have been temporarily occupied. Although you are in a difficult environment, you have closely relied on the people, persisted in guerrilla warfare behind Chiang's lines, crushed the Chiang army's several mopping-up operations, and taken advantage of the victory to counterattack, cooperate with the main forces in combat, recover vast areas, contain the Chiang army's forces, and threaten the enemy's rear transportation. Especially in the recent half-month, you have taken the initiative to attack, continuously annihilated the enemy's and puppet's effective strength, accumulated small victories into large victories, and created favorable conditions for the future recovery of all lost territory. A circular is hereby issued throughout the region to widely promote this spirit, and it is hoped that you will continue your efforts, expand guerrilla warfare, fight more annihilation battles, and fight to the end to defend the southern Shanxi liberated area and strive for the victory of the overall resistance.
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng, 13th Dispatch] (Delayed) A part of our main force of the Eighth Route Army dispatched to the Jinxi area began a self-defense counterattack on September 28th and captured Kangcheng Town, eighty li northeast of Xi County, in one fell swoop. All 190+ personnel of the Yan puppet Fifth District Office and local teams entrenched in the town and Lijia Mountain were annihilated. A total of 160+ people, including those below the battalion commander, were captured alive, and more than ten were killed or wounded. Only eight people were injured and escaped. 65 rifles, 3 light machine guns, and a portion of ammunition were seized. The leaders of the military region issued a special circular of commendation upon hearing the news. The circular briefly stated: Your heroic combat resulted in the liberation of Kecheng Town, Pu County, on September 10th, at a very small cost, capturing more than 200 people. This latest glorious victory is an excellent example of our army's self-defense operations, and should be widely studied and promoted, accumulating small victories into large victories, and continuously annihilating the enemy's invading forces.

    【本报阳城十六日电】我军恢复浮（山）翼（城）公路后，该线附近之舟子山、猪头山、月山岭等重要高地，完全为我控制，现数万民众已将公路破坏四十余里。南庄桥至梁家河间蒋阎军构筑之巨大碉堡十五座全部拆掉。南庄桥之大桥一座，已为民兵炸毁，蒋军曾于翼城强抓夫数次抢修，均被民兵沿途截回，现浮山民兵与襄陵临汾翼城等地武装联系一片积极开展游击战争。
    【本报阳城十七日电】太岳军区首长欣闻三分区地方武装开展游击战，粉碎蒋军三次“扫荡”，恢复敌后广大地区，获得辉煌战果，特通令嘉奖王墉司令员、柴泽民政治委员、各基干兵团、各游击队及民兵游击小组全体同志。通令称：自蒋军侵入晋南以来，我三分区广大土地暂时沦陷，你们虽在艰苦环境下，紧紧依靠人民，坚持蒋后游击战争，粉碎蒋军数次扫荡，并乘胜反击，配合主力作战恢复广大土地，牵制蒋军兵力，威胁日后方交通，尤以近半月来主动出击，不断歼灭顽伪有生力量，积小胜为大胜，为将来收复一切失地创造了有利条件，特通令全区广为发扬，并望再接再厉，扩大游击战争，打更多的歼灭战，为保卫晋南解放区、争取全面抵抗的胜利而战斗到底。
    【本报阳城十三日电】（迟到）我分遣晋西地区之八路军主力一部，九月廿八日开始自卫反击，一举将隰县东北八十里之康城镇攻克，盘据该镇及李家山之阎伪五区署及地方团队一百九十余人全部歼灭，计生俘营长以下一百六十余人，毙伤十余人，仅有八人负伤逃逸；缴获步枪六十五支，轻机枪三挺，子弹一部；我仅副班长一人负伤。军区首长闻讯特通令嘉奖，该通令略称：你们英勇作战，曾于九月十日以极小代价解放蒲县克城镇，俘虏二百余人。此次又获光辉战果，实为我军自卫作战之极好范例，应普遍学习发挥，积小胜为大胜，不断歼灭进犯军的有生力量。
