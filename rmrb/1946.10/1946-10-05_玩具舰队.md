　　“Toy Fleet”
    Lin Ming
    The Kuomintang government expressed great joy at the "new fleet's" return from the United States, fully expecting that its power in the civil war would be greatly enhanced, but the reality brought a cruel irony.

    This "new fleet" allocated and ceded to China was a ridiculously small fleet. The fleet consisted of eight ships, including two destroyers, four minesweepers, and two cruisers, all of which were old and of extremely small tonnage. The largest destroyer, the "Ta Kang," was only 1,300 tons, and the smallest were 500 to 600 tons. Because of their small tonnage, these ships were only given numbers in the United States and not formal names. "Ta Kang" and "Yung Sheng" were names given after China received them. Someone who had seen this fleet jokingly called it a "toy fleet." Only Kuomintang officials, accustomed to the Chinese navy trained in the mountains of Guizhou, dared to call it a "new fleet." Even more ludicrous was that when the fleet was transferred from Shanghai to Nanjing in mid-July, the government actually ordered: "The fleet should travel slowly from Shanghai to Nanjing so that people on both sides of the river can admire its majestic appearance." (See Central News Agency dispatch) What a disgrace for China!

    Before the fleet had been in Nanjing for a week, the price of American cigarettes in Nanjing plummeted, and watches, pens, and soap suddenly became abundant. It turned out that our new fleet, in addition to carrying back four of the latest Lincoln automobiles, was also loaded with the above-mentioned American goods. News reporters reported on this matter, and rumors spread that the new fleet commander Lin Zun and the "Yung Ning" ship captain were dismissed, forcing the Kuomintang authorities to publicly deny it, saying that such incidents "hurt international perception." Indeed, the officers of these ships were adept at corruption. They deducted soldiers' travel and uniform expenses and drastically lowered soldiers' salaries. They had attempted to pay soldiers only three U.S. dollars per month (later forced to change to thirty dollars), while they themselves received two hundred to three hundred U.S. dollars per month. The soldiers had gone on a hunger strike to protest the officers' corruption. There was even a "strike" where they all refused to attend the ship reception ceremony. American reporters treated it as big news. For this "rebellion," eight sailors were sent back to China, initially planned to be "executed," but later not carried out.

    Shortly after the fleet arrived in Nanjing, all the original captains were replaced. According to insiders, this replacement was related to factional struggles. Originally, there were four factions in the navy: the Fujian faction (also known as the Mawei faction), the Qingdao faction, the Huangpu faction (also known as the Guangdong faction), and the Jiangyin School Electrical Engineering faction. Later, the Electrical Engineering School was abolished and merged with the Qingdao Naval School, so these two factions were sometimes difficult to distinguish. Among the eight original captains, there were two from each faction. As a result of this struggle, the Electrical Engineering faction gained two more people, becoming four. The Guangdong faction suffered because of the corruption of Xu Heng, the captain of the "Yung Ning" ship of that faction.

    But more importantly, it was the unwillingness of naval personnel to participate in the civil war. Those responsible for receiving and driving this fleet back to China were the sixty U.S. military officers and more than nine hundred Youth Army soldiers selected by the Kuomintang authorities to go to the United States a year before the Japanese surrendered. The warmongering Kuomintang masters painstakingly cultivated this group of naval talents, fully expecting them to loyally serve as their tools in the civil war. Unexpectedly, as soon as the "new fleet" arrived in Nanjing, half of the personnel requested to be discharged. This troubled the Kuomintang military leaders. If they really left, how could these American warships be started to participate in the civil war? So Chen Cheng, Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, hurriedly came out to give a speech, saying how dangerous the country had become, how "betraying the party" hindered the country's construction, and that now was the time for the soldiers who had returned after completing their studies to take on the important responsibility of "defending the party and the country," so it was decided to send the "new fleet" to the Bohai Sea to take on a "sacred mission," even if you cannot strike at the "treacherous party," you must patrol so that the treacherous party does not strike at the government. When the soldiers heard that they were immediately going to fight in the civil war, they were even more unwilling to do so. Chief Chen discovered this failure and revised the new strategy of "luring with benefits," promoting some so-called "young and promising" soldiers to the ranks of second lieutenant and warrant officer, becoming naval officers. Those among them who were sent to Qingdao to receive the ship were booked first-class sleeper cars on the Beijing-Shanghai railway by the government. Sometimes there were not enough seats, so a few second-class seats were mixed in, and the clerks repeatedly apologized to them. In a country where soldiers usually traveled in freight cars, this was truly an exception. Chief Chen was also afraid that someone would sabotage morale on the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Shanghai, so he ordered the river surface to be cleared and no small boats were allowed to stay. So-called painstaking efforts, but promotion is not a thorough solution, it cannot promote all the soldiers to officials, and random promotion will cause dissatisfaction among the original officials. Use coercive measures, Nanjing is across the river from the CCP's Liberated Areas, and they are afraid that they will "take risks," so the "new fleet" has been slow to leave Nanjing. And the grand welcome jointly prepared by the party, government, and military in Shanghai to welcome the fleet back to Shanghai had to slowly cool down.

### “玩具舰队”

　　“玩具舰队”
    林明
    国民党政府对“新舰队”从美返国表示极大的高兴，满以为内战力量又可以大大增强，但事实却给带来了残酷的讽刺。
    这支拨、让给中国的“新舰队”是一个小得可笑的舰队。舰只共八艘，包括驱逐舰二，扫雷艇四，巡洋舰二，都是些吨位极小的老旧舰只。其中最大的驱逐舰“太康”号，也只有一千三百吨，最小的有五六百吨的。这些舰船在美国因其吨位的小，只编号使用，而不给以什么正式名字。“太康”“永胜”之类是中国接收以后命名的。观光过这个舰队的，有人戏谑地称之为“玩具舰队”。只有看惯了贵州山地训练出来的中国海军的国民党官员，才敢于称之为“新舰队”。更滑稽的是当七月中旬，该舰队由沪转京时，政府竟命令：“该舰队由沪驶京时尽量慢行，以便两岸民众瞻仰雄姿。”（见中央社电）真可替中国出丑！
    该舰队抵京不及一周，南京的美国香烟大跌价，手表、钢笔、肥皂突告充斥。原来我们的新舰队上，除了载回四辆最新式的林肯汽车以外，还载满了上述各种美国货。新闻记者报导了这件事情，并传出新舰队指挥官林遵及“永宁”号舰长为此去职的消息，致使国民党当局不得不公开声明否认，说此类事件“有碍国际视听”云。的确，这些舰只的官长都是些舞弊的能手，他们克扣士兵的旅费和制装费并大量的压低士兵的薪水。曾企图发给士兵每月三元美金（后被迫改为三十元），而他们自己却是每月二百元至三百元美金。士兵们曾经为抗议长官的贪污绝食过。并且更有一次全体“罢工”，不去参加接舰的典礼。使美国记者当作新闻大事。为了这次“叛变”，有八个水兵被解回国，最初拟议“枪决”，后来又没有执行。
    这次舰队抵京后不久，所有原来的舰长都被调换了。据熟悉内幕者谈：这次调换与派别斗争有关系，原来在海军中，存在着四个派系，即福建系（或称马尾系）、青岛系、黄埔系（或称广东系）、江阴学校电雷系，后来电雷学校取消，与青岛海军学校合并，故这两系有时是分不大清的。原任八位舰长中是每系二人。这次斗的结果，电雷系增加了两个人，成了四个。广东系因该系“永寗”号舰长徐亨的舞弊，吃了亏。
    但更重要的倒是海军人员的不愿内战的心情。负责接收和驾驶这一舰队返国的是日寇投降前一年国民党当局选派赴美的六十位美军军官和九百多名青年军士兵。好战的国民党老爷们煞费苦心的造就这批海军人才，满以为可以忠实的充当他们内战工具，想不到“新舰队”刚刚抵京，立即有一半人员要求退伍。这就苦恼了国民党的军事领袖们、如果他们真的离开了，这些美国军舰怎么开动起来参加内战呢？于是国防部参谋总长兼海军总司令陈诚急忙亲自出来训话，说国家到了如何危险的程度，“叛党”如何妨碍国家的建设，现在正需要学成归国的战士负起“捍卫党国”的重责，所以决定派“新舰队”到渤海湾去担当“神圣的任务”，即使你们不能打击奸党，也要去巡游，使奸党不致打击政府云云。士兵们听说马上派去打内战，就更其不愿意干了。陈诚总长发现了这个失败，重又改定了“利诱”的新计策，把一部分所谓“青年有为”的士兵提升为少尉、准尉阶级，成为海军军官。他们之中被派往青岛接舰的人，由政府订京沪路的头等卧车。有时座位不够夹杂了几个二等座，办事员还向他们连连道歉。这在大兵一向坐车皮的国度里，真可算是例外。陈总长又怕京沪之间长江水面上有人破坏兵心，特下令清除河面，不准有小船只停留。所谓用心更良苦，但提升总不是彻底办法，不能把所有的士兵都升个官呵，而且随便提升又会引起原任官的不满。施用强迫手段吧，南京对江就是中共解放区，又怕他们“挺而走险”以致“新舰队”迟迟未能离京。而上海所老早准备好了欢迎该舰队返沪的党政军团联合盛大的欢迎就只好慢慢冷淡下来。
