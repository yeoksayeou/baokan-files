　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Enrage People with Rape, Plunder
　　Ten Thousand Join the Army in Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Within Ten Days
　　Veteran Soldiers from the Rear of the Jin-Hebei-Lu Yu Military Region Headquarters Go to the Front
　　[Report from this newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 12th] After Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops occupied our Third and Fifth Military Sub-districts and the Heze area, their acts of rape and plunder have aroused irrepressible anger among the people of the entire region, who are clamoring to join the Eighth Route Army to defeat the invaders. Within ten days, 10,200 people throughout the region have flocked to join the main forces. In Feicheng, 1,800 young people enlisted in the army within ten days. More than 1,700 young people have signed up for military service in Qingfeng. The conscription movement is also vigorously underway in Pingyin, Chapiing, Tai'xi, Yunju, Yuncheng, Nanhua, Yunbei, Puyang, Neihuang, Huaxian, Gaoling, Junxian, Weinan, and Yanjin counties.
　　[Special Dispatch from this newspaper] More than sixty veteran soldiers and veteran cadres from units directly under the Jin-Hebei-Lu Yu Military Region, working in the rear, are burning with intense anger towards the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists, and are heroically returning to the front lines of the patriotic self-defense war. Comrades Cheng Yaoxian and Qin Xiaofu had already been granted permission by their superiors to return home to get married, but when news came that Chiang's troops had invaded Heze, they immediately abandoned the idea of returning home and resolutely went to the front to kill the enemy. Comrade Wang Yujing received a letter from home just as he was about to leave, informing him that his father was seriously ill, but he did not hesitate and went forward resolutely. Comrades Lü Dingfa, Wang Xiaohu, Cao Zuoqi, Shu Shijie, and Wu Tingxie, after eight years of hard fighting, some with disabilities and some suffering from stomach ailments, also went on their way without hesitation. They said, "We have long seen through Chiang Kai-shek's thieving nature. He wants to sell the Chinese people to American imperialists to be their slaves, but we won't let him!" Comrade Wang Jiefu knows how to drive tanks, and was particularly happy to hear that our army had captured Chiang's and the Americans' tanks in the Longhai campaign. He also volunteered to go to the front to use Chiang's tanks to destroy Chiang's troops.

    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】蒋伪军在侵占我三、五分区及荷泽地区后，奸淫掳掠，激起全区人民不可遏止的愤怒，纷纷要求参加八路军，打垮进犯者。十天内全区已有一万零二百人涌入主力军。肥城十日内即有一千八百青年入伍。清丰一千七百余青年报名参军。参军运动尚在平阴、茬平、泰西、郓巨、郓城、南华、郓北、濮阳、内黄、滑县、高陵、浚县、卫南、延津等县蓬勃开展中。
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区直属队六十多个在后方工作的老战士与老干部燃烧着对卖国贼蒋介石与美帝国主义者的强烈愤怒，英勇地重新走上爱国自卫战争前线。程耀先与秦小福二同志，上级早已允许他们回家结婚，但当蒋军侵占荷泽的消息传来时，他们立即打消了回家的念头，坚决走上前线去杀敌。王育敬同志在正要出发时接到家信，父亲身患重病，但他毫未踌躇，毅然前去。吕定法、王小虎、曹作棋、舒世杰、吴廷燮等同志，经过八年奋战，有的身有残疾，有的肠胃患病，但也毫不顾忌的走上了征途。他们说：“老子们早就看透了蒋介石这小子的贼骨头，他想把中国老百姓送给美帝国主义当牛马，老子们就是不让！”王捷夫同志会开坦克，这次听说我军在陇海战役中把蒋美的坦克车缴获了，分外高兴，亦自报奋勇走上前线，要用蒋军的坦克去消灭蒋军。
