Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 29th. In recent days, Chiang planes have frequently harassed Xuanhua City, the capital of Chahar Province. On the 26th, one Chiang plane intruded into the city's airspace, circled over the south of the city for a long time, and dropped eight bombs, while also scattering absurd leaflets. On the afternoon of the 27th, Chiang planes harassed Xuanhua City again, strafing the railway line in the southern suburbs with American-made dumdum bullets at low altitude for 25 minutes, wounding two pedestrians.
