　　Accepting the New Spirit, Unleashing Great Efforts
    Mass Movement Unfolds in the Fourth District of Feixiang
    [Report from this newspaper in Weixian] Accepting the new spirit and unleashing great efforts, the Fourth District of Feixiang is taking the lead in breaking the stagnant situation. Comrade Sun, the District Party Secretary, openly criticized his past failure to let go and allow everyone to work freely, stating that this was very wrong. He affirmed that the government would now support the masses in taking the lead, removing the "golden headband," and thoroughly defeating traitors, local bullies, and landlords. The activists were happy to hear this and said, "That's right! It can't be done otherwise. Just looking for the root of poverty without taking action is a waste of time. If we keep looking, the stingy misers will all run away!" After the self-criticism, everyone's spirits were high. The activists from Tiantaishan Village returned to the village and started working without even drinking soup. In less than the time it takes to eat a meal, they arrested nine local bullies and landlords. The masses were extremely excited, saying, "This is how it should have been done long ago!" It was still dark, with stars in the sky, when the gongs started ringing in the streets, shouting, "Get up! Meeting time!" The sound of gongs in the streets, children singing, and people shouting created a lively atmosphere. The activists from Bei Wanggu Village discussed it briefly and then started working. Thanks to the diligence of the militia, not a single traitor or bully escaped. The broadcast station quickly announced the victory news, and the masses were happily discussing, "This is truly a new world; everything is ours now. Let's be bold and do it!"

    【本报威县讯】接受新精神，放手大干，肥乡四区快马当先打开消沉局面，区委书记孙同志公开检讨过去没放开手，不敢让大家干，这是非常不对的，今后政府一定撑腰，让群众作主，摘去金箍帽，把汉奸恶霸地主打个落花流水。积极分子听了高兴的说：“对啦！非这样干不起来，光找穷根不干，白耽误功夫，再找，苛人精都跑光啦！”经过检讨，大家情绪都很高。天台山积极分子回到村，顾不得喝汤就干起来，不足一顿饭的功夫，把九个恶霸地主扣起来，“早就该这样办了！”群众都兴奋得了不得。满天还是星星，街上就敲起锣来，喊着：“起来呀！开会哩！”街上的锣声、儿童的歌声、人们的嚷嚷声，闹成一团。北王固村积极分子回去酝酿了一下就干起来，由于民兵的用心，奸霸们一个也没逃掉。广播台迅速发出胜利消息，群众都高兴的谈论着：“这才是翻过天来，净剩下咱的了，大胆的干吧！”
