　　[This dispatch from our Changzhi office dated 30th] Zanhuang's Dongtan Mountain Village is frequently harassed by puppet troops from Yuanshi City. The village's great tyrant and traitor, Fan Laowu, took the opportunity to spread rumors, suppressing the masses' struggle to settle accounts with him. Recently, after the emancipation work team arrived in the village and understood the situation, they first rectified the militia self-defense force, established a village headquarters, buried landmines in the east of the village, built defensive fortifications, and at night the emancipation work team comrades and the militia jointly stood guard. The masses were greatly encouraged and said, "The cadres live and die with us; if they are not afraid, why should we dare not fight?!" They immediately launched accusations against Fan Laowu. Fan had colluded with the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance to kill twelve innocent people in the village. At the request of the broad masses, the government immediately arrested and executed him according to law. After this, the masses' fighting spirit was even higher, and the militia also researched many new defense methods, such as setting up tripwires and ringing cords at the village entrance and main roads, and every household prepared stones, bricks, iron forks, and wooden sticks on the roofs. Adults and children alike were also equipped with weapons, ready to repel any puppet troops who dared to invade. On the night of August 10th, more than a hundred puppet troops from Yuanshi, carrying two machine guns, launched a surprise attack and surrounded the village, but were immediately repelled by the militia relying on their fortifications. The masses said happily, "Our village has a way now, so we can emancipate ourselves with peace of mind!"

　　赞皇东坛山摆下响铃绊马索
    民兵英勇保卫翻身
    凭依工事击退元氏伪军
    【本报长治三十日电】赞皇东坛山村经常遭受元氏城伪军袭扰，该村大恶霸、汉奸范老五乘机造谣，镇压群众对他的清算斗争。最近翻身队到达该村了解情况后，即首先整顿民兵自卫队，建立村指挥部，并在村东埋地雷，建立防御工事，夜里翻身队同志们并与民兵共同警戒。群众大为振奋，都说：“干部与咱同生共死，人家都不怕我们为甚不敢干？！”当即展开了对范老五的控诉。范曾于抗战中勾引日寇杀死该村无辜群众十二人，在广大群众要求下，政府即依法将其逮捕枪毙。此后群众斗争情绪更加高涨，民兵亦研究出许多新的设防办法，如在村口要道设置绊马索与响铃索，家家户户房顶上准备下石块、砖头、铁叉和木棍。大人小孩亦均准备有武器，准备随时击退敢于侵犯之伪军。八月十日夜，元氏伪军百余，带机枪两挺奔袭包围该村，当即被民兵凭据工事击退，群众都高兴地说：“咱村有了办法啦，以后放心翻身吧！”
