            I. Families of Double Resistance
    On the morning of the 4th, before the sun had risen, the courtyard of the street office was already crowded with men and women. They were discussing how to repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. As everyone was expressing their indignation, Old Xu Zhen, in his forties, pulled his own son to the street chief. Although he was old, his voice was very loud. He said angrily, "Last winter, when Old Chiang attacked our liberated area, I sent my nephew to the front line to fight him back. Now Old Chiang is coming again, and I'm sending my own son to the front line to fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death. Now I want to be a family of double resistance..." The men and women present immediately shouted the slogan "Support families of double resistance!"
    In the morning, District Chief Li arrived, and a group of children from Dongguan quickly surrounded the district chief, saying happily, "District Chief! Dongguan has a family of double resistance! Come and see..."
    Xu Zhen was very old. He held the district chief's hand tightly and said, "Before the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, my whole family of five relied on my shoulders, selling water every day to survive, often without food or drink. Since the democratic government came here, my life has been getting better day by day. Now the reactionaries are coming to bully me again, and my whole family wants to fight them."
            II. Husband and Wife's Night Talk
    Women's Federation member Liu Xue'e and her husband Liu Xiaohai were a young and harmonious couple. Especially after the land reform, many people envied their happy life. At night, they lay in bed discussing Chiang Kai-shek's renewed offensive against the liberated areas:
    "Damn it, Old Chiang, that bastard, is attacking our liberated area again. What do you think we should do?" Liu Xiaohai asked his wife.
    "You join the Eighth Route Army and fight him," the woman told him bluntly.
    "If I leave, what will you do?"
    "I'll spin and weave at home and do a good job of production."
    "Then, at the meeting tomorrow, you have to give a speech to see me off. You have to talk about how you'll live at home...."
    "But I don't know how to speak to everyone, I've never spoken before... Teach me!"
    So Liu Xiaohai became the teacher, and his wife followed along and learned it once. Both of them thought it was very satisfactory before they went to sleep.
    The next day (the 4th), after breakfast, following the sound of the gong for the meeting, men and women flocked to the street office. The village chief briefly explained that Old Chiang was attacking the liberated area and that everyone should discuss how to deal with it. While the village chief was speaking, Liu Xue'e's eyes were fixed on her husband. As soon as the village chief finished speaking, Liu Xiaohai winked at his wife, and his wife immediately stepped onto the stage. She stood on the steps of the main house and said, "My name is... I... my... man... is going to join the Eighth Route Army to fight Old Chiang... I... will do a good job of production at home... We... women... should all learn from me, I... have nothing more to say..."
    After the meeting, Liu Xue'e felt very regretful, feeling that she had not spoken well. But Liu Xiaohai felt very proud standing in the ranks of the new soldiers.
            III. Only by Defeating Old Chiang Can We Enjoy Happiness
    At the army recruitment meeting in Dongguan Street on the morning of the 4th, Jiang Zhengxi, the chairman of the People's Association, was the first to speak on stage. He was a young man of twenty-five, who had never had a good day in his life. Since he was ten years old, he had been carrying a fried dough stick plate and shouting in the streets and alleys, "Fried dough sticks, fried dough sticks!" In the dead of winter, with snowflakes flying in the sky, the rich people stayed at home by warm stoves and still complained of discomfort, but Jiang Zhengxi, wearing ragged cotton clothes, still sold his fried dough sticks in the streets, or else he would starve. Now he has been liberated, planted a rich root, and has food and clothing, but Chiang Kai-shek will not let him do so. He now angrily shouted, "I had long ago made up my mind to go to the front line. Before the Eighth Route Army came, I sold fried dough sticks every day, without a house or land. Now I have a house and land, and logically I should enjoy happiness, but Chiang Kai-shek wants to take away my house and land and not let me enjoy happiness. I want to join the Eighth Route Army and go to the front line. I think only by defeating Old Chiang can we enjoy happiness..." After he finished speaking, twelve liberated young people followed him, shouting, "Only by defeating Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, can we enjoy happiness." They all voluntarily signed up to join the army.

　　武安城参军琐记
    秋原
            一、双抗属
    在四日的早上，太阳还没有出山，街公所的院子里就挤满了男男女女的人。他们在这里讨论如何把蒋介石的进攻打退。大家正在愤慨之际，四十余岁的老徐贞拉着他的亲生儿子走到了街长跟前，他虽然年纪大了，但嗓子却十分嘹亮，他气愤的说：“去年冬天老蒋进攻咱解放区，我把俺侄儿子送到了前线上把他打退了，现在老蒋又来了，我叫我的亲生儿再到前线上和蒋介石拚个高低。现在我就要当双抗属了……”到会的男女立即喊出“拥护双抗属的口号！”
    上午的时候，李区长到了，东关一群小儿童们很快把区长包围起来，高兴的说：“区长！俺东关有了双抗属啦。你快去看看……”
    徐贞很老了，他紧紧的拉着区长的手说：“共产党八路军没有来时，我全家五口人全靠我这个肩臂，每天卖水养活，常时没吃没喝。自民主政府到这里，我的时光一天比一天好了。现在反动派又来欺侮我，我全家人要和他干一下。”
            二、夫妻夜话
    妇联会员刘学的和她的男人刘小孩，是一对年青而又和睦的夫妇，特别是翻身后，他们的愉快生活许多人都很羡慕。夜晚他俩躺在了床上谈论起蒋介石又要进攻解放区的事来：
    “他娘的×，老蒋这个混蛋又进攻咱解放区来了，你说该怎办？……”刘小孩问他的妻。
    “你参加八路军去打他妻侄。”女人很干脆的告他。
    “我要走了，你怎么办哩？”
    “我在家纺花织布好好生产。”
    “那末，在明天开会时，你可得讲讲话欢送我。把你在家怎过都得说说……。”
    “俺可不会向大家讲，俺没讲过……你教教俺吧！”
    于是刘小孩就作了老师，他妻也跟着学习了一遍，两口子都认为很满意了才转入梦乡。
    第二天（四号）吃过早饭，跟着开会的锣声，男男女女的都涌到街公所了，村长把老蒋进攻解放区，大家讨论如何对付，简单的说了一下。当村长讲话的时候刘学的的一双眼紧紧盯着她丈夫，村长一说完，刘小孩向他老婆使了个眼色，他老婆立即走上了台，她站在正房的阶台上，说：“我叫……俺……男……人……去参加八路军，打老蒋，……我……在家好好生产……。咱……们……妇女……都学我就行，我……没有啦……。”
    散会后，刘学的感到十分后悔，觉得她没有讲好。可是刘小孩却感到非常骄傲的站在新战士的行列中。
            三、打败老蒋才能享福
    四号上午东关街的参军会上，平民会主席江正喜第一个走上台说话，他是一个二十五岁的小伙子，从小到大没有好过一天。自他十岁以后，就端着一个油条盘子在大街小巷叫喊着“熟油条，熟油条！”深冬腊月天空飞着雪花，有钱人在家守着温暖的炉了还嫌不舒服，但江正喜呢，穿着破烂的棉衣还一样的在街头上叫卖他的油条，要不照样他就要饿肚子。现在他翻了身，栽下富根，有吃有穿了，但蒋介石不让他这样做，他现在愤怒的喊：“我老早就下了决心要上前线。八路军还没来时，我天天卖油条，没房没地，现在我有房，又有地，按理说我应该享福了，但蒋介石要来夺我的房和地，不叫我享福，我要参加八路军到前线上去，我看只有打败老蒋才能享福……”他讲完后，有十二个翻了身的青年也跟着他喊着：“只有打败蒋介石卖国贼才能享福。”都自动报名参了军。
