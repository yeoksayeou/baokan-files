Bianqu Industrial Research Institute
    Successfully Trials Bleaching Powder
    Continued Research Promises Establishment of a Three-Acid Industry

    [Our Newspaper, Handan News] Under the call of the democratic government to reward creation and increase production for self-defense, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Industrial Manufacturing Research Institute, after discovering a large amount of manganese ore in the Taihang Mountains, resolved the commonly used contact agent in chemical industrial manufacturing. Immediately, technician Ma Mingsan began trial production of bleaching powder, which has now been successfully tested. It completely utilizes the Border Region's self-made sulfuric acid and locally produced raw materials (manganese, salt, lime, etc.), so the cost is much lower than imported goods. More importantly, it expands the use of self-made products such as sulfuric acid. If a large amount of fluorine gas can be produced, hydrochloric acid can also be manufactured, then the Border Region's three-acid industry, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid, can all be resolved.

    Further news: In view of the fact that the dyes used by the people in the Border Region are mostly imported and expensive, the institute is using the sulfide alkali products of the Yongsheng Chemical Industry Cooperative as raw materials to manufacture sulfide dyes, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in dyes. It is reported that the institute has jointly developed a factory construction plan with the Handan Municipal Government's Construction Section, which will begin construction this winter and is expected to be on the market by next spring.

　　边区工业研究所
    试制漂白粉成功
    继续研究可望建立三酸工业
    【本报邯郸讯】在民主政府奖励创造，增加生产自卫号召下，晋冀鲁豫边区工业制造研究所，于太行山发现大量锰矿后，化学工业制造上，常用之接触剂，获得解决。当即由技士马铭三试造漂白粉，现已试验成功。完全利用边区自制之硫酸，和土产原料（锰、食盐、石灰等），所以成本低于外来品甚多。更重要的是：扩大了自制成品如硫酸等的用途，如能大量制造氟气，又可制造盐酸，则边区之三酸工业，硫酸、硝酸和盐酸即可全部解决。
    又讯：该所鉴于边区人民所用染料，多外来品，价格昂贵，就利用永生化学工业社之硫化碱出品做原料，制造硫化染料，以求染料自给。闻该所已会同邯郸市政府建设科，作出设厂计划，今冬开始建设，预计明春即可出货应市。
