Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: As Chiang's troops mobilized five divisions to invade eastward along the Shenyang-Jilin railway line, the Democratic Allied Army of the Liaoning Military Region, in coordination with local regiments and militias, launched a heroic self-defense campaign. Within a week, they killed or wounded over 1,100 Chiang soldiers, including a deputy regimental commander from the New 6th Army's 207th Division (equipped with American weaponry), captured over 1,000 officers and soldiers (from battalion commander level down), and seized over 100 American-style machine guns, eight 60mm mortars, three mortars, one radio station, four trucks, over twenty war horses, over 155,000 rounds of ammunition, over 700 rounds of artillery shells, over 200,000 jin of rice, three million jin of coarse grains, and other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Beijing News: Over the past month, newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin have often revealed the true situation of the war in Eastern Hebei. The Ta Kung Pao reported that Eastern Hebei "is still at war," and admitted that the initiative there had been transferred to the Eighth Route Army. A dispatch in the paper on September 19 stated: "Only Macheng Town in Luan County is guarded by the 'Volunteer Corps' (Editor's note: Macheng was recovered by the Eighth Route Army on October 8). Important towns and villages such as Dachen, Zengjia'e, and Zhanggezhuang were recovered with the arrival of the Nationalists, but abandoned as the Nationalists advanced. In Leting (Editor's note: This city was recovered by the Eighth Route Army for the third time on October 9) and Qian'an, only the county seat strongholds are occupied, and everything else remains the same." Furthermore, "villages five or six li from the city have recently received orders from the liberated areas," "local Communist workers are still active, and troops and militias still lay mines on roads, along villages, on hilltops, and in favorable terrain." "They are mixed in with the population and cannot be identified." (Ta Kung Pao, September 13, 25). After Chiang's troops penetrated deeply, the mass guerrilla warfare surged, and even a few empty cities were difficult to defend. On September 30, the paper also stated: "The Nationalist army has gradually withdrawn from counties such as Yutian and Zunhua." On October 17, the paper bluntly stated: "The military period in Eastern Hebei has not yet passed, and there are occasional military operations outside the counties. The Jin-Yu section of the Beining Railway, under the protection of American troops, is not smooth because militias are active everywhere." On October 15, the Yi Shi Bao reported: "Trains from Tianjin East did not depart on the 14th." The traitorous secret service organizations "Returning Home Teams" and "Refugee Associations" instigated by Chiang Kai-shek have now disappeared. The Ta Kung Pao said on October 4 that some of these "Returning Home Teams" dare not "return home" anymore. Those who followed Chiang's army to "return home" have also secretly climbed back into the city because "the Communist political influence has not diminished at all." The paper has also repeatedly criticized the deterioration of military discipline of Chiang's army: "The army's (referring to Chiang's army) discipline is bad, and people are deeply troubled. Farmers have to bear the expenses of local troops, the requisition of land taxes, and all kinds of unknown expenses" (Ta Kung Pao, October 4). The collusion between Chiang's government and the army to exploit the people was reported by the Ta Kung Pao on October 10: "County governments strictly ordered villages in the 'recovered areas' to purchase self-defense equipment themselves, so people had to sell their cattle and movable property in order to buy guns and ammunition. In Luan County, more than 60 percent of people bought broken guns on market days, and the price of cattle was extremely low. The army auctioned off broken guns, and after the people bought the broken guns, they had to pay a gun repair fee, causing everyone to shed tears."

　　辽宁军民英勇自卫
    一周内歼蒋军二千
    冀东主动权已转入我军手中
    【新华社东北十九日电】当蒋军调动五个师兵力沿沈吉线东犯之际，辽宁军区民主联军配合地方兵团及民兵即进行英勇自卫，一周内共毙伤蒋军主力美械装备之新六军二○七师之某副团长以下一千一百余名，生俘营长以下官兵一千余名，缴获美式机枪百余挺、六○小炮八门、迫击炮三门、电台一架、汽车四辆、战马二十余匹、子弹十五万五千余发、炮弹七百余发、大米二十余万斤、杂粮三百万斤及其他军用品甚多。
    【新华社延安十九日电】北平讯：一个月来，平津报纸常常透露冀东战事真实情况。大公报通讯称：冀东“仍是战事未已”，并承认该处主动权皆已转入八路军手中。该报九月十九日通讯内称：“滦县只有一个马城镇由‘义勇队’驻守（编者按：马城已于十月八日为八路军光复），其余大城、曾家峨、张各庄等重要村镇都随国军到达被收复又随国军前进而放弃。乐亭（编者按：该城已于十月九日为八路军第三次光复）和迁安，也只将县城据点占有，其他依旧。”并且凡“离城五六里村庄，近日仍奉到解放区命令”“中共地方工作人员仍然活动，军队和民兵仍然在公路上、村沿、山头及良好地形处都埋有地雷。”“他们混在老百姓群中是无法辨认的。”（九月十三、二十五同报），蒋军孤军深入后，群众游击战争蜂起，而连几座空城也把守不易。九月三十日该报又称：“国军已逐渐由玉田、遵化等县撤退。”十月十七日该报就索性露骨的说：“冀东军事时期仍未过去，各县以外时有军事行动了，在美军协助保护下的北宁路津榆段，民兵到处活动，现在也不能畅通。”十月十五日益世报称：“十四日自津东去列车都未开出。”为蒋介石驱使的汉奸特务组织“还乡队”“难民同乡会”等现在也消声匿迹了。十月四日大公报说：这些“还乡队”，有的不敢“还乡”了。跟随着蒋军“还乡”的，也已偷偷爬回城内，原因是“中共的政治势力毫无减退。”对蒋军军纪之败坏，该报亦迭有指责：“军队（指蒋军）纪律坏，人们都深感头痛。农民须负担地方军队开销、田赋征实以及一切无名的开支”，（十月四日大公报）蒋方政府与军队之狼狈为奸互相压榨人民，十月十日大公报曾有下述报导：“各县府严令‘收复区’各村自购自卫，因此人民只好把耕牛、动产变卖以便购卖枪弹。滦县每逢集日，买破枪的有百分之六十以上，耕牛价格奇贱，军队把破枪大加拍卖，老百姓买得破枪后，还须出一笔修枪费，弄得老百姓个个洒眼泪”。
