　　Yongcheng Militia Bravely Kill the Enemy
　　[This newspaper Yangcheng 23rd dispatch] The Yongcheng militia persists in guerrilla warfare, attacking invading Chiang troops. In the past month, there have been more than 120 battles of various sizes, killing and wounding more than 70 enemy soldiers below the rank of company commander, and recovering 16 head of livestock, a flock of sheep, and more than 30,000 catties of grain. The ratio of our militia's wounded to the enemy is only one to eight and a half, creating many combat paradigms. On September 25th, more than 200 Chiang troops from Dajiao Town, Jiang County, invaded our Shangbaima Village in two routes. They were ambushed by seven of our militiamen, killing one Chiang army company commander and one platoon leader, and seven soldiers, and were defeated and retreated. One day at dawn, 200 members of the "Love the Village Corps" in Jiang County went to Zhongwei and Wuzhai to seize grain and conscript soldiers. More than 20 of our militiamen charged the stubborn army three times in a row. Under fierce artillery fire, they killed two stubborn enemies and wounded four. All the wheat that the Chiang stubborn army had seized, one large cart and two cows, were recovered. On the 6th, more than 300 men from the Tingjin Detachment of the 3rd and 2nd districts of the "Love the Village Corps" in the city went to Nanche, Xiashimen and other areas in our 2nd district to rob. One班 of our militia first blocked them, and more than 100 members of the 3rd district's rotational warfare team went to assist upon hearing the news. The militias from various places came upon hearing the news, forming a battle line more than ten miles long. After more than three hours of fierce fighting, 18 stubborn enemies were killed and wounded, six cows, four mules, and a flock of sheep were seized, and eight civilians were liberated. Only one of our militiamen was slightly injured.
