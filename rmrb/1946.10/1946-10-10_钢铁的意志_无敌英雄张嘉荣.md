　　Steel Will
    ——Invincible Hero Zhang Jiarong
    Shi Chao
    ——On the plains of Ji, Lu, and Yu, strewn with the stinking corpses of enemies—right here, our people's soldiers created deeds worthy of song and tears.
    The feudal landlords and their lackeys, the towering walled villages and dense forests, the crisscrossing trenches and countless interconnected bunkers constituted the medieval fortress of Lvyuanzi.
    Hong Xiuquan of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom failed to open this feudal fortress. The Japanese also failed to open it, and finally compromised, using it to suppress and exploit the farmers in this area. Now, the Kuomintang is colluding with it, making it an indestructible fortress to block our advance. However, we—the people's army—will destroy it in broad daylight today!
    Today, a squad is to be selected as the assault team.
    The battalion political instructor knew in his heart that selecting the assault team could not be done through free registration; otherwise, it would be like rewriting the roster—everyone in the battalion wanted to be a glorious assault team member! The political instructor personally went to the Ninth Company to select the individuals. Those selected were happy. Those not selected resented their own lack of effort.
    Soldier Zhang Jiarong was called in for a talk.
    "The organization has decided that you will participate in the assault team. Do you have any objections?"
    "Really? Me?" His eyes were filled with joy, satisfaction, happiness, and pride. "Am I qualified?"
    "You are! Comrade!"
    "Can I do it well?"
    "You can! You have combat experience! You will attack that front." Zhang Jiarong looked at the place the political instructor was pointing at—the ancient castle was on a high ground, below the village was a wide moat, and behind the moat were uneven bunkers, trees blocking the sky, the whole of Lvyuanzi was gloomy.
    "You have to occupy that village gate, that—did you see it clearly? It's that biggest village gate, charge up! Take it down! Whether the entire battalion's mission can be completed this time..."
    He interrupted the political instructor's words, he trembled nervously, the muscles on his face twitched, flat without a trace of emotion, he said: "Charge up and take it down! Don't worry, as long as I'm alive, insurance is not a problem!"
    "This mission is very important, whether the entire battalion can attack depends on you..."
    "In my heart, there is nothing that cannot be completed!" He interrupted the political instructor again.
    "Right! Right! The organization believes your words." The political instructor affirmed repeatedly.
    "Is there anything else?" He waited quietly for an answer. The physiological tension he had produced when receiving the mission slowly eased.
    "Nothing else!" After a pause, the political instructor showed a slight smile, sent him out of the grass-covered hideout, waved his hand and said: "Goodbye!"
    He had just taken two steps and came back again.
    "Will I still be alive to see you?" Zhang Jiarong's eyes flashed with light, he knew he would soon meet the enemy's bullets, he seemed to want to say something to the political instructor, but immediately smiled. He put his legs together, leaned the gun against his body, and saluted. "Okay! Political Instructor! Whenever you give the order, I will occupy the village gate!"
    "Go boldly! We will definitely meet! Pay attention to using the terrain! This battle must..."
    Before the political instructor finished speaking, Zhang Jiarong ran away.
    The enemy's stray bullets, "swoosh, swoosh," passed over his head.
    The attack began!
    In front of the entire battalion, eight people were running—eight assault team members, led by Zhang Jiarong. The sound of cannons and guns mixed together, with no gaps to be found. In Zhang Jiarong's heart and eyes, there was nothing but the village gate that the political instructor had mentioned. Zhang Jiarong carried nothing on him, only a basket of grenades and a rifle.
    The river is crossed!—This can't stop Zhang Jiarong.
    The ditch is also crossed!—This also can't stop Zhang Jiarong.
    Arrived at the bunker in front of the village gate. Bullets were fired from inside the bunker, and three people fell.
    "Three are dead!" He didn't look, didn't think, but he became even more angry.
    "Bomb! Throw grenades! Throw!" he shouted. Grenades flew over in strings. The bunkers were uncovered and blossomed, and the enemies died inside.
    "Bomb! Throw grenades! Throw!" he yelled, his face blackened by the smoke from his teeth biting the grenade pull cords.
    Grenades flew over again in strings. All the bunkers were uncovered and blossomed. The enemies all died inside.
    The village gate opened. Five people's soldiers—Zhang Jiarong's partners—also died.
    Inside the village gate were more bunkers. He charged in. "Charge up and take it down!" He didn't forget the political instructor's words. He alone was going to destroy these bunkers, to occupy this large village gate! He threw grenades, arrived there, there rose black smoke, there the bunkers were uncovered.
    The enemy is a brutal and tenacious enemy! But they were facing our brave and steadfast people's soldiers!
    When the enemy poked their heads out of the bunkers to shoot at our attacking troops, he shot at the enemy. Those lucky enough bled and then pulled their heads back, the unlucky ones couldn't even pull their heads back.
    The bunker's firepower was concentrated on him. The enemy's bullet hit his leg, and he immediately fell down, tightly gripping the gun.
    After fainting, he quickly regained consciousness. He heard deafening gunshots under his buttocks, he realized he was lying on top of the bunker.
    "You shoot! I'll see you shoot!" He suddenly stood up and fell down again, his leg was broken.
    He felt for grenades, but the grenades were gone.
    The main force was approaching quickly, and he watched as several remaining bunkers fired at our troops. He was angry, he was indignant. He was smart, and he was also at a loss. He stood up as strong as steel, he forgot the pain. His will supported his body. He jumped up, using only his remaining leg and one foot to stomp on the bunker, stomp, stomp, stomp, making the bunker shake. There was no more gunfire inside, the enemy ran away. Zhang Jiarong couldn't hold on any longer, and fell flat. He struggled, struggled, and he fainted.
    Seven dead comrades, seven guns, placed in front of the village gate.
    He woke up, and he saw them.
    "Leg! You counter-revolutionary!" He desperately beat and blamed his leg. But he still couldn't stand up.
    "Political Instructor! I'm inside the village gate! Come up quickly!" He cried, "The comrades who came with me are all dead, only I'm left, but I will never let the enemy take their guns!"
    He crawled over, and crawled back again. Where he crawled, there was a trail of blood.
    "Are you still alive? Say a word to me!" He shook his beloved partners, but the dead lay quietly, silent.
    He looked at his partners' faces, each person's face had the same expression—bravery, anger, regret.
    "Our mission is completed, I'm still occupying the village gate, the enemy doesn't dare to come!" When he took the guns from the dead men's hands and arms and put them on his own back, he comforted them.
    The faces of the dead became peaceful.
    He put the seven guns in a pile, and he sat on top of them. —His will supported his body to sit on top, neither falling nor lying down. But, he had lost consciousness.
    From this village gate—exchanged for the lives of eight people's soldiers—the troops rushed in, the battle was quickly resolved, Lvyuanzi was filled with the enemy's corpses, and the living surrendered their guns.
    The political instructor arrived, and behind the village gate, he saw—seven guns, and sitting on the seven guns was a bloody man, the bloody man holding a bloody gun. Straight, his eyes unblinking, staring at a gun hole in a bunker inside the village.
    "Ah! Zhang Jiarong? Comrade!" The political instructor recognized him. The bloody man did not answer, his eyes still unblinking.
    "You're injured, call a stretcher to carry you!" He squatted in front of the bloody man, turned his head to the communicator: "Call a stretcher! Quick! Quick!"
    The political instructor looked up and down repeatedly at Zhang Jiarong, muttering to himself: "Too much blood has been lost, too much."
    The bloody man did not answer, his eyes blinked.
    "The stretcher has been called! Zhang Jiarong! Give me the gun!"
    The bloody man's eyeballs were red, emitting a firm red light. Staring straight at the political instructor.
    "Which unit are you from? This is the Ninth Company's gun, it can't be given to you!" His throat felt like it was stuffed with something, dry and hoarse, he cried out, tightly holding the trigger.
    "I am your political instructor! Don't you recognize me?"
    "You? You are..." Zhang Jiarong blinked hard, grabbing the political instructor like a child seeing his mother. Tears dripped from his gray-black face, falling to the ground, little by little red spots, blood tears!
    "Political Instructor?" He stood up like a normal person, without pain, looked at the political instructor again and again, and nodded.
    "Right! That's right! You are my political instructor! Political Instructor, you have come, give me a few more people, I want to vent this anger!" He pointed to the seven dead comrades.
    The faces of the dead became more peaceful.
    Before he finished speaking, he couldn't support himself and fell into the political instructor's arms.
    "You can't move anymore, Comrade!"
    Zhang Jiarong slowly raised his head, tightly holding the political instructor's hand, his voice low, trembling, asking: "Did I complete my mission?"
    "Completed! Completed! You completed it!"
    He smiled, smiled so innocently and purely, as if saying: "Political Instructor, I have completed my mission!"
    The stretcher arrived. The political instructor carried him onto the stretcher.
    "These are the guns of our Ninth Company," he leaned up and pointed to the seven guns placed on the ground, stained red with his blood. "This one is the one I used, give it to the Ninth Company, tell the company to take good care of it for me, when I come back, I will still use this gun!"
    The stretcher was carried far away, and the political instructor still stood there blankly, watching the afterimage of the stretcher, silently praying for the safety of people's soldier Zhang Jiarong.

　　钢铁的意志
    ——无敌英雄张嘉荣
    史超
    ——在横躺着敌人腥臭尸体的冀鲁豫原野上——就在这里，我们人民战士创造了可歌可泣的事迹。
    封建地主和他驾驭下的狗才，高耸的围寨和密森森的树木，纵横交错着的沟堑和无数通联着的地堡构成了吕园子这座中世纪的古堡。
    太平天国洪秀全没有能打开这座封建的古堡。日本人也没有能打开它，而终于妥协，利用它镇压和剥削这一带的农民。现在，国民党又勾结它，把它做为一个不可摧毁的堡垒，阻挡我们的进军。然而，我们——人民的军队，就要在今天白天摧毁它！
    今天要选拔一个班做为突击队。
    营教导员心中明白：选拔突击队不能采用自由报名的方式了，不然就等于重抄一次花名记——全营的人员谁不想当光荣的突击队员呢？教导员亲自到九连去圈定人。选上的人高兴了。没轮到的瞒怨自己不争气。
    战士张嘉荣被叫来谈话。
    “组织上决定你参加突击队，你有意见吗？”
    “真的？让我？”他的眼睛里洋溢着愉快满足幸福和骄傲。“我有资格吗？”
    “你有的！同志！”
    “我能做好吗？”
    “你能！你有战斗经验！你们就冲这个正面。”张嘉荣瞧着教导员手指的地方——古堡在高地上，寨下面就是宽宽的护城河，河后是高低不平的地堡，树木遮住了天，整个吕园子是阴凄凄的。
    “你们要占领那个寨门，那个——你瞧清楚了没有？就是那个最大的寨门，冲上去！拿下来！这一次全营的任务能不能完成……”
    他截断了教导员的话，他紧张的战抖起来，脸上的肌肉在跳动，平板板的没有一丝感情，他说：“冲上去，拿下来！你放心，只要我活着保险不成问题！”
    “这个任务非常重要，全营能不能攻上去，全在你们了……”
    “在我心里就没有完不成的事”！他又打断了教导员的话。
    “对！对！你的话组织上相信。”教导员肯定的重复着。
    “没有别的事了吗？”他静等着回答，他受领任务时所产生的生理的紧张，慢慢松缓下来。
    “没有了！”停了停，教导员露出一丝微笑，送他出了用草盖的隐蔽所，挥了挥手说：“再见！”
    他刚走了两步，又回来。
    “我还能活着看见你吗？”张嘉荣眼睛闪着亮光，他知道他马上就要和敌人的枪弹见面了，他似乎还想向教导员说什么，但立刻微笑一下。将两腿一并，枪身靠住身子，敬了一个礼。“好！教导员！你什么时候发号令我就什么时候占领寨门！”
    “放心大胆去吧！我们一定能见面！注意利用地形地物！这次作战要……”
    教导员还未说完话，张嘉荣就跑开了。
    “要坚定，勇敢！你放心好了！”他回过头来向着教导员笑了，他笑的是那样的天真纯洁，似乎在问：“你的意思，我猜着了吧？”
    教导员也笑了，点了点头。
    随后张嘉荣飞快跑去了。敌人的流弹，“苏，苏”的从他头上穿过。
    进攻了！
    全营人的前面，有八个人飞跑着——八个突击队员，领头的是张嘉荣。炮声、枪声混成一片，找不出间隙来。在张嘉荣的心里眼里什么也没有，只有教导员所说的那个寨门。在张嘉荣的身上，什么也没带，只有一筐手榴弹和一支步枪。
    河过去了！——这当不住张嘉荣。
    沟也过去了！——这也挡不住张嘉荣。
    到了寨门前的地堡。地堡内射出了子弹，三个人躺下了。
    “死了三个！”他没有看，也没有想，但他更加愤怒了。
    “炸！摔手榴弹！摔！”他喊。手榴弹一串串的飞过去。地堡揭了盖开了花、敌人就死在里面。
    “炸！摔手榴弹！摔！”他叫，他的脸被牙咬手榴弹拉绳时，冒出的烟熏黑了。
    手榴弹又成串地飞过去。地堡全揭了盖开了花。敌人都死在里面。
    寨门打开了。五个人民战士——张嘉荣的伙伴也死去了。
    寨门内又是地堡。他冲进去。“冲上去，拿下来！”教导员的话他没忘记。他一个人要摧毁这些地堡，要占领这座大寨门！他摔手榴弹，来到那儿，那儿冒起了灰黑色的烟，那儿的地堡就揭了盖。
    敌人是残暴顽强的敌人啊！但遇着的是我们勇敢坚定的人民战士！
    敌人从地堡内钻出头来，射击我们进攻的部队，他就朝着敌人射击，运气好的，流了血后又把头缩回去，倒楣的，连头也缩不回去了。
    地堡的火力集中到他的身上了。敌人的子弹射中了他的腿，他立刻栽倒了，紧紧的握着枪。
    昏迷后，马上又清醒过来。他屁股下面射出震耳的枪声，他发觉他躺在地堡上头。
    “你打！我看你们还打！”他猛的站起来又倒下去，他的腿断了。
    他摸手榴弹，手榴弹没有了。
    大部队快接近了，他眼看着几个残存的地堡向我们部队射击。他气，他愤激。他聪明，他又茫然。他像钢一样的坚强的站起来，他忘却了痛苦。他的意志支持着他的肉体。他跳起来，用仅存的一只腿一只脚在地堡上跺，跺，跺，跺的地堡都震动了。里面再不见枪声，敌人吓跑了。张嘉荣再也支持不住，平平的摔倒了。他挣扎，挣扎，他昏了。
    七个死了的同志，七支枪，摆在寨门前。
    他醒了，他看见了。
    “腿！你反革命！”他拚命的捶打和瞒怨自己的腿。然而还是站不起来。
    “教导员！我在寨门里啦！你们快上来吧！”他流了泪，“跟我来的同志都死了，只剩我一个了，但他们的枪我也决不让敌人拿去！”
    他爬过来，又爬过去。他爬到那里，那里就是一道血迹。
    “你还活着吗？给我说一句话！”他摇动着他亲爱的伙伴，但死者静静的躺着不声不语。
    他看着他伙伴的脸，每个人的脸上都是同一的表情——勇敢，愤怒，遗恨。
    “咱们的任务是完成了，我还占着寨门呢，敌人不敢来！”当他从死者手里怀里取出枪背到自己身上的时候，他安慰他们。
    死者的脸变得安详了。
    他把七支枪放成一堆，他坐在上面。——他的意志支持他的肉体坐在上面，没有倒也没卧下。可是，他是失掉了知觉。
    从这个寨门——用八个人民战士生命所换取来的寨门——队伍冲进去，战斗迅速的解决了，吕园子内躺满着敌人的死尸，活着的缴了枪。
    教导员来了，在寨门的后边，他看见——七支枪，七支枪上坐着一个血人，血人端着一支血枪。直挺挺的，眼睛一眨不眨的瞪向寨内一个地堡的枪眼。
    “啊！张嘉荣？同志！”教导员认出来了。血人没有回答，眼还是没眨一眨。
    “你受伤了，叫担架来抬你！”他蹲在血人的面前，回头向通信员：“叫担架来！快！快！”
    教导员上下反复的看着张嘉荣，口中自语着：“血流的太多了，太多了。”
    血人没有回答，眼眨了一眨。
    “叫担架去了！张嘉荣！你把枪交给我吧！”
    血人的眼珠是红的，射出坚毅红色的光。直瞪着教导员。
    “你是那一部分的？这是九连的枪，不能交给你！”他喉咙内像塞了东西，干燥的嘶哑的叫起来，紧紧的扣着板机。
    “我是你的教导员！你不认识了吗？”
    “你？你是……”张嘉荣用力眨了眨眼，像孩子见了亲娘似的抓着了教导员。泪珠从他灰黑色的脸上一滴一滴的滴下来，落到地上，是一点一点的红斑，是血泪啊！
    “教导员？”他像常人一样，毫无痛苦的站起来，对着教导员看了又看，点了点头。
    “对！不错！你是我的教导员！教导员你来了，再给我几个人，我要出这口气去！”他指着七个死了的同志。
    死者的脸孔，变得更加安详了。
    话未说完，他没法支持着自己，倒到教导员的怀里。
    “你不能再动了，同志！”
    张嘉荣慢慢的抬起了头，紧握着教导员的手，声音低沉的，颤抖的问：“我的任务完成了吗？”
    “完成了！完成了！你完成了！”
    他笑了，笑得那样的天真纯洁，好像是说：“教导员，我的任务完成了吧！”
    担架来了。教导员把他抱上担架。
    “这是我们九连的枪，”他斜起身子指着地下放着的七支被他的血染红了的枪。“这一支是我用的，交到九连，告诉连上给我好好的保存，回来时，我还要用这支枪的！”
    担架抬远了，教导员还呆呆地站在那里目送着担架的后影，默祷着人民战士张嘉荣的平安。
