　　Wu'an Masses Care for Refugees, Respond to Call to Collect Winter Clothing

    [Our Newspaper Wu'an News] After the Chiang army invaded the Qugou area of Anyang, the people there, unwilling to suffer the Chiang army's cruel ravages, fled their homes to the Liberated Areas. The Taihang Third Administrative Office, recognizing that with the end of autumn and the approach of winter, many refugees who had fled were still wearing only thin clothing, issued a call to the entire region to donate winter clothing to relieve the refugees. Citizens from all streets in Wu'an enthusiastically responded to this call. Bai Shaoting from Third Street took off the cotton-padded coat he was wearing and gave it to the street public office, saying, "All people under heaven are one family. We must not let the refugees suffer!" On the 10th and 11th of this month, over one hundred and seventy items of clothing have already been collected and sent to the district public office for distribution to the refugees.

    【本报武安讯】蒋军侵占我安阳曲沟一带后，该地人民不愿受蒋军残酷蹂躏，纷纷弃家逃来解放区。太行三专署鉴于秋末冬来，逃出之难胞仍多身着单衣，特向全区号召捐募寒衣救济难胞，武安各街市民热烈响应这一号召，三街白绍庭将身上穿的棉衣脱下，交给街公所说：“天下人民是一家，决不能叫难胞受罪”！本月十、十一两日间，已募得一百七十余件，送交区公所转与难胞。
