    Random Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper

    Twenty years ago, in Shanghai, I saw how Zhang Zongchang and Li Baozhang killed people. I always felt that these two executioners were the epitome of cruelty. However, lately, when I think about it, executioners like Zhang Zongchang and Li Baozhang are nowhere to be found now. When Zhang Zongchang killed someone, he had the gall to say, "I, Zhang, killed them." When Li Baozhang killed someone, he had the nerve to hang the head on a lamppost. They were unrepentant, they were inhuman, but they hadn't yet fallen to the level of being worse than beasts. Even beasts don't deny it after eating someone.

    These past few days, I saw in the newspaper that the first Cardinal Archbishop appointed by the Vatican to China gave a speech. He not only "predicted" that a third world war was inevitable but also hoped it would break out sooner rather than later. Upon seeing this Archbishop's lofty pronouncements in a newspaper, I couldn't help but sigh and exclaim: now we know what "teaching" he "teaches"!

    Of course, he teaches the "true teaching"—the kind of "teaching" that says, "Anyway, you're all going to die, so it's better to die sooner than later." But what I admire is that this Archbishop is willing to speak the truth. He says what he thinks, straight from the heart, with the style of Zhang Zongchang and Li Baozhang. I find this more straightforward and easier to understand than grand pronouncements like "the US military's mission in China is to repatriate Japanese prisoners."

    In this day and age, cruel executioners are certainly plentiful, but cruel and un-despicable executioners, like beasts, are impossible to find even with a lantern.

    However, I still regret that this Archbishop's courage is not enough. He hasn't yet initiated a "Third World War Come Quickly" prayer meeting!

    Some people probably pray like this—no, they are "betting" on it. In fact, this is not unusual. Someone across the Pacific is threatening with "Third World War," so it's no wonder someone on this side of the Pacific wants to bet on it. And just like the speculators in Shanghai not long ago used "Unified Bonds C" to "kick the ball," people on both sides of the Atlantic are also "kicking the ball" with "Third World War." The poor "heroes" on this side of the Pacific aren't even qualified to "grab a hat" in this great game of kickball, so they can only bet on it. Perhaps their hearts will never die until that ball is kicked to pieces?

    So I also think that those bishops and the like will one day not only "preach" like this, but also pray like this. Amen!

　　读报偶感
    二十年前，在上海看过张宗昌、李宝章怎样杀人的，总觉得这两个刽子手残忍到无以复加，然而近来想想，像张宗昌、李宝章那样的刽子手，现在倒也找不出来了。张宗昌杀了人，还有胆量说是“我姓张的杀的”，李宝章杀了人，也有胆量把人头挂在路灯杆上。他们不赖，他们没有人性，然而他们究竟还没有堕落到比野兽还不如，野兽吃了人，也从不赖账。
    这几天又看见报上说，罗马教廷派驻中国的第一位枢机大主教发表谈话，既“预言”了第三次世界大战必不可避免，接着就盼望其早点爆发。有一张报上提到这位大主教的高论，不禁慨然叹道：由此可知他“主”的是什么“教”！
    他主的当然是“正教，”——就是“你们反正命该一死，迟死不如早死好些”的那种“教”。不过我所钦佩者，是这位大主教肯说实话，心里怎么想，口里就怎么说，严然还有张宗昌、李宝章一流的风格，我倒觉得这比什么“美军在华任务是遣散日俘”一类堂皇文告来的痛快爽直，容易了解。
    这年头儿，残忍的刽子手确乎车载斗量，但是能残忍而不卑鄙像野兽一样的刽子手实在打起灯笼没处找。
    不过仍然遗憾于这位大主教的勇气，尚嫌不足，他还没有发起一个“第三次世界大战快快到来”的祈祷会呵！
    有人大概这样祈祷，——不，在这样“押宝”，事实原来也算不得稀奇，太平洋彼岸有人拿“第三次世界大战”相威胁，难怪太平洋此岸有人要押此一宝。而且像不久以前上海的投机商人拿“统债丙”来“踢皮球”似的，大西洋两岸也有人把“第三次世界大战”来“踢皮球”；可怜的太平洋此岸的“英雄”，在这一场大踢皮球中“抢帽子”还够不上，只好押它一宝。大概是不到那皮球踢破，此心总是不死的吧？
    于是我又想到那些主教之类大概总有一天不但这样“说教”，而且要这样祈祷了，阿门！
