　　　　Chiang-Controlled Areas Impose Heavy Taxes, People in Northern Henan Flee to Our Areas
　　The bureaucrats, soldiers, and secret agents in the Chiang-controlled areas of northern Henan impose exorbitant taxes and levies, causing people of all strata to go bankrupt and flee to the liberated areas in a continuous stream. On the 16th of this month, seven refugees fled from the Chiang-controlled area of Tangyin to Anyang, carrying a large amount of fake Ji banknotes. According to them, the original legal tender they carried was forcibly exchanged for fake banknotes by the Chiang army sentry at Danientun, Anyang, through intimidation and deception. The village office told them that these Ji banknotes were fake. The female refugees burst into tears, and the men cursed in anger, which was extremely tragic. The local village office provided comfort, food, and lodging, and informed them that they could receive government relief everywhere in the liberated areas.
