Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 28th. The 40,000 militiamen of Huailai, situated at the vanguard of the Chahar liberated area, are prepared to resolutely strike any invaders. All 140,000 people in the county are engaged in intense self-defense mobilization. Villages and towns along the railway line have now completed self-defense preparations. Field fortifications and explosive pits are crisscrossed, vowing to make any invaders pay a heavy bloody price for every inch of land they seize. More than 20,000 self-defense team members have been投入 (put into) logistics work. The autumn harvest is now ripe, and men, women, old and young, front and rear, are in the fields day and night, rushing to harvest and implement a scorched earth policy. Along the Qinglongqiao front line, although constantly subjected to shelling and strafing by Chiang's troops, the autumn harvest has still been successfully completed. Zhang Dianchen, a demobilized soldier, leads a labor-military integrated work exchange team that has gone deep into the vicinity of Chiang's army strongholds to harvest the autumn crops. The villages of Chadao, Muxia and others have already reaped more than 6,000 mu of autumn grain. No trace of grain can be seen in the fields or threshing grounds. Eighth Route Army soldiers, in their spare time from war preparation, are also actively helping farmers who lack labor to harvest the autumn crops. The political organs of the garrison have ordered the entire army to help the masses harvest two mu of crops per person. The villagers of Cangfangying say: "The army and the people in the liberated area are truly one family. Farmers are soldiers and soldiers are farmers. With military-civilian cooperation, if Chiang Kai-shek comes to invade, we will surely break his head and snap his wrists."

　　在每寸土地上索还血的代价！
    怀来民兵布好爆炸网
    【新华社宣化二十八日电】处于察哈尔解放区前卫阵地的怀来四万民兵，准备予进犯者以坚决打击，全县十四万人民正在紧张进行自卫动员中，铁路沿线各村镇现已完成自卫准备工作，地里工事、爆炸坑等纵横交错，誓必使进犯者夺取每一寸土地时付出巨大血的代价。投入后勤工作的自卫队员，亦已有两万余人，现秋禾已熟，前后方男女老幼，正日夜置身田野，进行抢收和坚壁清野。沿青龙桥一线边沿区，虽不断遭到蒋军炮轰扫射，秋收仍已胜利完成。复员军人张殿臣领导的劳武结合的变工队，曾深入蒋军堡垒附近收秋，现岔道、目匣等村已抢割秋禾六千余亩，地里场上已不见粮食形踪，八路军战士在备战余暇，亦积极帮助缺乏劳力的农民秋收，驻军政治机关已命令全军每人帮助群众割两亩庄稼，苍房营的老乡说：“解放区军民真正是一家，农就是兵，兵就是农，军民合作，蒋介石要来侵犯，准叫他打破头颅，折断手腕。”
