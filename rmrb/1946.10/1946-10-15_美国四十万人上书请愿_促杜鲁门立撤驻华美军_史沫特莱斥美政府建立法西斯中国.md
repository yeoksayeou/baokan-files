Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Delayed news from New York: The National Council for Peace announced on September 27th that approximately 400,000 people had signed a petition requesting Truman to immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China and cease unilateral aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government until a democratic coalition government is established in China. The council is also preparing to hold a national conference in San Francisco from October 18th to 20th, which will be the climax of the "Get Out of China" movement.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: New York dispatch: Prominent American writers are calling for a change in the government's China policy. Prominent American female writer Agnes Smedley published an article in The Nation magazine on August 31st entitled "We Are Building a Fascist China," denouncing the erroneous U.S. policy towards China and pointing out that the only path to peace in China is "America's withdrawal from China" and a change in U.S. policy towards China. Smedley stated: "If the Nationalist government were not supported by American guns and money, China would already be on the path to democracy." She urgently appealed to the American people: "Our government is tightly clinging to the worst and most corrupt elements in China," and it is up to the American people to take action.

    【新华社延安十二日电】纽约讯：美著名作家纷纷要求改变政府对华政策。美著名女作家史沫特莱于八月三十一日民族杂志上发表题为“我们正在建立一个法西斯的中国”之论文，痛斥美对华错误政策，并指出促使中国和平之唯一道路，就是“美国退出中国”，改变美国对华政策。史沫特莱称：“如果不以美国枪炮和金钱支持国民党政府，则中国已经走向民主之途了”。她并向美国人民紧急呼吁：“我们的政府已紧紧地靠着中国最恶劣最腐朽的分子”，有待于美国人民来采取行动了。
