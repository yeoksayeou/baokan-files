Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Hong Kong dispatch: Fifteen cultural organizations in Hong Kong and Guangdong jointly telegraphed Truman, Wallace, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the Committee for Peace, the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, and the American people on the 23rd of last month, expressing resonance with the "Withdraw from China Week" held by various democratic groups in the United States and Wallace's speech. The telegram stated: "The current U.S. policy of unilaterally assisting the Kuomintang government's civil war under the guise of 'mediation' not only plunges the Chinese people into an unprecedentedly cruel war but also accelerates the world's progress towards a third world war. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this policy of adding fuel to the fire!" The telegram pointed out: The current problem in China is a struggle between dictatorship and democracy, a struggle between an "evil government" that disregards the life and death of the people and democrats who actually want to implement the Three Principles of the People. Only by earnestly implementing the resolutions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference can the China problem be rationally resolved. Finally, it stated that it would devote all efforts to support the "U.S. troops withdraw from China" movement until the current U.S. policy towards China is thoroughly changed. The fifteen cultural organizations are the Hong Kong Branch of the Literary Association, the Hong Kong Chinese Youth Journalists Association, the Literary Youth Federation, the Huashang Friendship Society, the Huashang Daily, the People's Daily, the Zheng Bao, Theory and Reality, Free World, Free Books, Literary Life, and National Magazine, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Hong Kong dispatch: Hong Kong and Guangdong celebrities Li Zhangda, Peng Zemin, Zhang Wen, Feng Yujing, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Rutang, Li Boqiu, Shen Shuyuan, Qianlijú, Di Chaobai, Yang Shusheng, Chen Cisheng, Huang Yaomian, Sa Kongliao, Liu Zhongmu, etc., telegraphed the American Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy on September 18th, responding to "U.S. Troops Withdraw from China Week." The telegram stated: Recently, the U.S. military government has again sold a large number of surplus materials and armaments to the Nanjing government controlled by the dictatorial faction at low prices. This move will undoubtedly fuel the flames of the Chinese civil war and strengthen the dictatorial faction's oppression of the Chinese people. The Chinese people express extreme indignation at this! Therefore, we hope that your committee can mobilize public opinion in your country to urge the government to change its current policy towards China and withdraw its troops stationed in China as soon as possible.

    【新华社延安三日电】香港讯：港粤十五个文化团体，特于上月二十三日联合致电杜鲁门、华莱士、美国参众两院、争取和平委员会、远东民主政策委员会和美国全国人民，对美国各民主团体举行的“退出中国周”及华莱士演说，表示共鸣。该电中称：“美国在‘调处’的幌子之下，片面援助国民党政府内战的现行政策，不独陷中国人民于空前残酷的战祸之中，而且加速世界走上第三次世界大战的行程，中国人民坚决的反对美国这种火上加油的政策！”该电指出：中国目前的问题，是独裁与民主之争，是不顾人民死活的“恶政府”与事实上要实行三民主义的民主人士之争，只有切实实现莫斯科外长会议决议，中国问题才能有合理的解决。最后表示，誓以全力支持“美军退出中国”运动，直至美国现行对华政策彻底改变为止。该十五文化团体为文协港分会、香港中国青年记者学会、文艺青年联社谊、华商谊社、华商报、人民报、正报、理论与现实、自由世界、自由书刊、文艺生活、国民杂志等。
