[From Our Newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 19th] The Sixth District of Yuncheng held a meeting of all cadres to discuss the current situation, clarify their thinking, and convene a grievance-airing meeting for activists throughout the district. At the meeting, thousands of people wept and accused landlords and Chiang Kai-shek of their crimes. On the spot, a large number of young and middle-aged people enlisted in the army, creating an unprecedented wave of enthusiasm for joining the military. In the cadre meeting discussing the current situation, everyone unanimously recognized that "Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor and will never be kind to the common people. In order to protect our fruits [of labor], protect our parents, we can only defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." When each cadre recognized the seriousness of the situation, they all had the courage and determination to take the lead in joining the army. After the meeting, the cadres ran around day and night, holding mass meetings in various villages to expose Chiang Kai-shek's various crimes, creating a mass anti-civil war movement. The masses immediately took action, ramping up production, organizing vehicles of all sizes, stretchers, and preparing firewood to support the front lines. At the grievance-airing meeting for activists throughout the district, everyone scrambled to accuse the landlords of all kinds of exploitation and oppression of the poor: "We can't eat enough, we can't wear warm clothes, and all the grain we harvest throughout the year is considered someone else's." From airing grievances against the landlords, tracing the roots of the landlords, they further turned to airing grievances against the old government. Shao Sicheng of Shaohai said: "In the past, the dark government belonged to the landlords. The yamen faced south, but it was difficult to get in with reason but no money. Old Chiang is the head of the landlords. He is specifically good at bullying the poor." At this time, the masses shouted, "Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!" and demanded to be organized, armed, and requested guns from the higher authorities. When they thought of the good times of liberation now "having food to eat and land to cultivate," everyone said in unison, "These are the benefits that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have given us." "There is no way out without following Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." At that time, more than two hundred people immediately requested to join the Communist Party. The masses were boiling, and someone passionately shouted, "Do you have blood? Join the army!" This loud call stimulated everyone, and the masses flocked to the podium, shouting, "I'm joining the army! Write my name down!" Fathers signed up for their sons, and brothers competed to sign up. On-the-spot enlistments reached 137. After the meeting, various villages launched grievance-airing movements and enthusiastic enlistment competitions. For example, in Lugongtang Village, 42 people who signed up to join the army at the grievance-airing meeting. People in other villages also ignited the flames of revenge from their grievances and actively signed up to join the army, setting off a mass wave of enlistment. In just four days, 250 young and middle-aged people in the district took to the self-defense battlefield.

　　郓钜群众誓败蒋贼拔穷根
    诉冤苦燃起复仇怒火
    六区四天内二百五十人奋起参军
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】郓钜六区召开全体干部会议，座谈时事，打通思想，并召开全区积极分子诉苦大会，会上，千百人痛哭流涕，控诉地主与蒋介石的罪恶，当场，更有大批青壮年参军，造成空前的参军热潮。在干部座谈时事的会议中，大家一致认识到：“蒋介石是卖国贼，对老百姓绝不会客气。为了保卫果实，保卫爹娘，只有打垮蒋介石的进攻。”当每个干部认识到时局的严重时，都有了带头参军的勇气和决心。会后，干部们昼夜不停地奔跑，到各村开群众大会，揭发蒋介石的种种罪恶，造成了群众性的反内战运动。群众立即行动起来，突击生产，组织大小车辆，担架，准备柴草支援前线。在全区积极分子诉苦大会上，每个人都争先控诉地主对穷人的种种剥削压迫：“吃不饱，穿不暖，一年到头打下粮食都算人家的”。由诉地主的苦，追地主的根，进一步转向对旧政府诉苦。邵垓邵思成说：“过去黑暗政府是地主的，衙门朝南开，有理没钱难进来。老蒋是地主的头子，他是专会欺压穷人的。”这时群众高喊：“打退蒋介石的进攻！”并要求组织起来，武装起来，要求上级发枪。当他们想到现在“有饭吃，有地种”的翻身好时光时，大家都异口同声的说：“这是毛主席共产党给咱们的利益。”“不跟着毛主席共产党走，就没有出路。”当时即有二百多人要求参加共产党。群众沸腾起来了，有人激昂的高呼：“有血性吗？参军去！”这响亮的号召，刺激着每个人，群众都蜂拥地冲向主席台，喊着：“我参军！写我的名！”父亲替儿子报名，兄弟俩争着报名，当场报名者即达一百三十七名。会后，各村又展开了诉苦运动与热烈的参军竞赛。如吕公堂村在诉苦会上报名参军者即有四十二名，其他村庄群众，亦从诉苦中燃起复仇火焰，纷纷自动报名参军，掀起了群众性的参军热潮。仅仅在四天内，全区即有二百五十名青壮年走上自卫战场。
