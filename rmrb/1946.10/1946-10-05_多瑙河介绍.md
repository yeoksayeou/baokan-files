　　Introduction to the Danube River
    The Danube is the second-longest river in Europe (the longest river is the Volga in the Soviet Union), with a total length of 2,900 kilometers.  376 kilometers are navigable (from Regensburg in Bavaria, Germany, to Sulina in Romania). The Danube flows through eight countries: the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Germany. The import and export trade and domestic shipping of Central, Southeast, and Eastern European countries rely heavily on the Danube. Therefore, the Danube's shipping system is directly related to the interests of these countries. A long time ago, the United States and Britain attempted to interfere in the management of the Danube, hoping to use this to carry out economic infiltration into the aforementioned countries. When the German army retreated, the US and British command acquired more than 700 ships from Danube countries from the German army, including ships from allied countries and former enemy countries. Yugoslavia's ships alone accounted for 166 vessels. The Yugoslav authorities repeatedly negotiated with the US military to return the detained Yugoslav ships, but the US refused and, as a result, raised the so-called Danube River issue. Bakić, the secretary of the Yugoslav Council of Ministers, once said: The reason why the Allied authorities are putting pressure on Yugoslavia and other countries is to obtain the so-called "freedom of navigation on the Danube River."

　　多瑙河介绍
    多瑙河是欧洲的第二条大河（第一大河是苏联的伏尔加河），全长二千九百公里，可以通航的地带有三七六公里（从德国巴伐利亚省的累格斯堡到罗马尼亚的苏利那）。多瑙河流经八国，即苏联、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、南斯拉夫、匈牙利、捷克、奥地利与德国。中欧、东南欧及东欧诸国之出入口贸易及国内航运，依赖于多瑙河甚大，因而多瑙河的航运制度与这些国家有直接利益关系。好久以前，美英两国即图染指管理多瑙河，想借此来对上述诸国进行经济侵入。当德军撤退时，美英指挥部曾自德军手中获得多瑙河各国的船只七百余艘，其中包括盟国的与前敌国的船只，只是南斯拉夫的船只即占一六六艘。南国当局曾多番向美军交涉退还被扣之南国船只，但美方加以拒绝，并由此提出所谓多瑙河问题。南国部长委员会的秘书巴基区曾说：盟国当局对南斯拉夫等国施以压力的原因，就是想取得所谓：“多瑙河的自由航行权”。
