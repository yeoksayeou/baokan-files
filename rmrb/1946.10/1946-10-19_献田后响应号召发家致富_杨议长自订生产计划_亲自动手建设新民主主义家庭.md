　　【Benbao Weixian Seventeenth Dispatch】Yang Zhixuan, Chairman of the Chicken Coop County Council, actively supported the masses in realizing "the tiller owns his field" and donated more than 300 mu of good farmland. Recently, he responded to the call of the democratic government to develop production and formulated a new production plan to get rich. Mr. Yang lives in the city and was the largest landlord in the county. He did not participate in production from an early age. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was aroused by national indignation and followed the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army to fight against Japan behind enemy lines for eight years. He deeply knows that the force that determines the fate of the motherland is the broad masses of workers and peasants. To achieve China's independence and liberation, there is no other way than New Democracy. Therefore, he donated a large area of farmland to landless or land-poor farmers for cultivation, and determined to actively manage family affairs and develop production to consolidate the material foundation of the liberated areas. When the reporter visited Yang's residence, Chairman Yang gladly showed his production plan. Chairman Yang's family has eight people and currently owns 54 mu of land. In normal years, they can harvest more than 30 shi of grain per year. Counting some relatives who often live at home, there is still more than enough to eat. He plans to partner with others to use a mule to pull goods, solving the charcoal problem; the women manage the housework, spin and weave, solving the clothing needs of the whole family, and raise five pigs to solve the problem of eating meat and oil throughout the year. To increase income, he plans to hire two long-term workers from next year and dig another well (one well in the original field), personally cultivating 14 mu of old graveyard land into an orchard, and set up an oil mill after autumn. He currently has 40 sheep, which can earn at least 50,000 yuan per year. In addition, there are 11 ducks and 30 hens, which are also a considerable income. Chairman Yang talked with relish about his production plan that has been realized or is being realized, saying: "Personally managing New Democratic family affairs not only improves our lives but is also a great joy in my life."

　　献田后响应号召发家致富
    杨议长自订生产计划
    亲自动手建设新民主主义家庭
    【本报威县十七日电】鸡泽县议会议长杨直轩氏，积极赞助群众实现“耕者有其田”、献出三百余亩良田后，近又响应民主政府发展生产的号召，订出新的生产发家计划。杨氏家住城内，是全县第一家大地主，自幼未参加生产，抗战后激起民族义愤，追随共产党八路军辗转敌后抗战八年，深知决定祖国命运的力量是广大的工农群众，要求得中国独立奔放，舍新民主主义外无他途径。因此把大面田地献给无地或少地的农民耕种，并决心积极经营家务，发展生产。以坚实解放区物质基础，当记者是杨宅造访时，杨议长欣然以他的生产计划出示。杨议长全家八口人，现有土地五十四亩，按平常年景每年可打三十多石粮食，把经常住在家里的一些亲戚算上，食用仍绰绰有余。他计划以一头骡子与别人合伙拉脚，解决烧炭问题；女人料理家务、纺花织布，解决全家衣着，再养猪五头，解决全年吃肉吃油问题。为了增加收入，他计划从明年起雇两个长工，再打一眼井（原田一井），亲自将十四亩老坟地栽培成果园，秋后再设立一座油房。他现有四十只羊，每年至少可赚五万元，另外还有十一只鸭子，三十只母鸡，也是一笔可观的收入。杨议长津津有味地谈着他已实现或开始实现的生产计划说：”亲自动手经营新民主主义的家务，不但生活足可改善，且亦生平一大快事”。
