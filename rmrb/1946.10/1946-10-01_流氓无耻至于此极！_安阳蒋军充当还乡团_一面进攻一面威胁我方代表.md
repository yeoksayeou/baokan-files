Outrageous and Shameless Beyond Belief!
	Chiang's Troops in Anyang Act as the "Returning Home Corps"
	Attacking and Threatening Our Representatives Simultaneously
	[This newspaper's dispatch from Handan, 27th] Following the capture of our Fengle Town, the Kuomintang's 40th Division (formerly an army) stationed in Anyang occupied villages and towns such as Dayantun on the 4th, attempting to extend their lifeline for the civil war – the Pinghan Railway – all the way to the banks of the Zhang River. In order to conceal this conspiracy of military aggression, the Kuomintang reactionaries once again resorted to their rogue and shameless tactics. On the morning of the 4th, simultaneously with their invasion, the Kuomintang representative of the Anyang Executive Group delivered a memorandum to our representative, unreasonably demanding that our troops withdraw further. Our representative immediately refuted this with reason and demanded that Chiang's troops immediately cease their aggressive actions against the people of the liberated areas. The Chiang's representative stammered and said, "Those are so-called refugees." But when our representative proposed that the group conduct an on-the-spot investigation to determine the truth, the Chiang's representative obstructed in every possible way and threatened, "We cannot guarantee your safety." However, our representative persisted, and it was finally agreed to proceed on the 6th. At this time, the Kuomintang ordered its soldiers to wear looted civilian clothes and act as refugees. Some of them hadn't even changed out of their green military trousers. What was especially laughable was that these "refugees" who had come north to "return home" spoke with thick southern accents and were busy building walls, digging fortifications, and demolishing houses in the newly occupied villages, forcibly escorting batches of weeping peaceful residents to other places. The Kuomintang's deception was completely exposed by their own men, but they could no longer be bothered with such details. Chiang Kai-shek's order to expand the civil war and launch a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas was a "sacred decree." Thus, while the Executive Group was investigating in our occupied villages such as Dayantun, Chiang's troops' artillery and machine guns were launching a large-scale bombardment of the liberated areas west and north of Dayantun. On the section of the railway that had just been occupied by Chiang's troops, a track inspection car arrived, fully loaded with railway workers wearing red armbands from Chiang's side, busily repairing the railway to the north. The next day (the 7th), the "Returning Home Corps" of the invading troops simply disappeared. One by one, they all changed back into their military uniforms. Their unit designation was the 2nd Company of the 117th Regiment of the 40th Army, and they even voluntarily declared to our representative, on the orders of their superiors, "We only arrived here yesterday."

　　流氓无耻至于此极！
    安阳蒋军充当还乡团
    一面进攻一面威胁我方代表
    【本报邯郸二十七日电】驻安阳国民党四十师（原军）继陷我丰乐镇后，四日又占我大砚屯等村镇，企图将其内战输血管——平汉铁路一直伸展至漳河畔。为了掩盖这个军事进攻的阴谋，国民党反动派又一次施其流氓无赖手段，四日上午与其进犯同时，安阳执行小组国民党代表竟以备忘录一份送交我方代表，无理要求我军再行后撤，我方代表当即据理痛驳，并要求蒋军立即停止其对解放区人民进犯行为，蒋方代表支吾其词说：“那是难民所谓。”但当我代表提议小组实地调查事实真象时，蒋方代表又百般阻挠，并以“不保证安全”相威胁。但我代表始终坚持，始于六日成行。这时国民党又令其士兵穿着抢来的便衣充当难民，有的绿色军裤还没有换掉，尤其可笑的是这些到北方来“还乡”的“难民”们，竟是满口南方腔调，并且正在刚被侵占的村子里，忙着修围子、挖工事、拆房子，把成批哭泣着的和平居民，押送到别的地方去。国民党哄骗的把戏在他自己手下完全揭穿了，但是他已顾不得这许多，蒋介石扩大内战大举进犯解放区的命令是“圣旨”，于是正当执行小组在我大砚屯等被占村庄调查时，蒋军的大炮机关枪又向大砚屯以西以北灯解放区大举轰击着，在我刚被蒋军占领的一段铁路上，轧道车满载来了蒋方带红臂章的铁路工作人员，忙着向北修补铁路。第二天（七日），进犯军的“难民还乡团”干脆不见了，一个个都换上自己的军服，他们的番号是四十军一百十七团二连，还按长官的命令自动向我方代表声明说：“我们昨天才到这里的”。
