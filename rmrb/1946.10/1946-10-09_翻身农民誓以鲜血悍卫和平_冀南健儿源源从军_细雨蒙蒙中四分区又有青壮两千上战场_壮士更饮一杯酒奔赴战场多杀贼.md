[This newspaper’s dispatch from Weixian on the 7th] Two thousand land-reformed peasants from eight counties, including Julu, Xinhe, Nangong, Pingxiang, Guangzong, Weixian, Longping and Yaoshan, have rushed to the front lines. After Gao Hongkui, the director of Qunzhai Farmers' Association in Julu, led thirty young men to enlist collectively for the front lines, Xin Zhuang also led six young people to join the army, saying before leaving: "I have been reformed most thoroughly. I used to be a poor boy. This year I have thirty mu of land, a big cart, and an ox. Chiang Kai-shek wants to smash my rice bowl. I will fight him to the end." When Bai Fu and Yin Tongen joined the army, the spy Guo Xiankao tried to obstruct them. Yin reported to the Farmers' Association and brought him down. Members of the Workers' and Peasants' Association, village cadres, and the masses earnestly said to Yin and others: "Your mother is my mother, we will take care of all your food, drink, clothing, and shelter, and guarantee that not an inch of land will be left uncultivated." When Wu Huagui, director of the Wu Yue Farmers' Association in Renxian, led ten militiamen to join the army, he said indignantly: "I am a Communist Party member, and I am determined to defend the people with my blood." Early in the morning of the 8th, in the misty rain, when 500 brave men set off for the front lines, the villages along the Nangong-Weixian Road welcomed them and saw them off all the way to Weixian city. When the new soldiers passed Qiji Town, village cadres led the masses and students to greet them outside the north gate, offering tea and cigarettes. As soon as the new soldiers left the edge of Qiji Village, the decorated carts from Gao Gongzhuang came to greet them, with drums and gongs shaking the sky, coming from afar. Village cadres carried wine pots to each company and urged them to drink, saying: "Respect comrades with three cups, and win victories on the front lines." Elementary school students cheerfully sang songs such as "Sending Off Soldiers" and "Honoring Resistance," and so on. He Zhao Village sent a hundred catties of cigarettes, wine, and sweet pears, rejoicing in sending off the new soldiers. The students of Dongzhao Village Elementary School voluntarily donated more than ten catties of peanuts, happily sending them to the new soldiers, expressing their love.
[Further dispatch] More than a thousand young people from the Eleventh Military Sub-district have gloriously rushed to the front lines a few days ago.
