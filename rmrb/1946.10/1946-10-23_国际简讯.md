TASS, Paris, October 17th: The elections for the first French National Assembly have now begun. Paris and cities in various provinces have received the initial lists of candidates requesting registration from various political parties. All parties are making preparations. From the Socialist Party to the "De Gaulle Union," all are preparing an anti-communist election campaign. However, the Communist Party will receive the support of broad labor organizations. Various right-wing parties are discussing organizing a joint election bloc and proposing a unified list of candidates. However, these right-wing parties are not the biggest danger to French democratic organizations; they only received 25 percent of the vote in the June 2nd election. What is noteworthy is the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), which has abolished the party's coalition government and is cooperating with De Gaulle, preparing to support De Gaulle for president. As for the Socialist Party, its congress has decided to run independently in the November election. According to Paris newspapers, foreign reactionaries are exerting pressure on the French general election. French Finance Minister Schuman (one of the leaders of the Popular Republican Movement) recently returned from the United States and hinted that U.S. loans to France depend on the outcome of the French election.

United Press reported: Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito declared on the 17th that the Yugoslav government is willing to submit the Trieste issue to the United Nations and stated that if the provisions regarding Trieste in the Italian peace treaty are not changed, Yugoslavia will never sign it. According to Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Velebit said on the 18th that before Yugoslavia signs the Italian peace treaty, it will insist that two points of the original Paris treaty must be amended: (1) Increase the rights of the People's Assembly of the Free Territory of Trieste while limiting the rights of the governor. (2) Modify the Franco-proposed Italian-Yugoslav border, making the border south of Trieste the current Yugoslav-occupied line. Velebit pointed out that if the Four Powers approve the current treaty, Yugoslavia will not be bound by it, and Yugoslav-Italian relations will continue to be based on the armistice agreement. Velebit also said that if Italy acknowledges its responsibility for the Italian army's aggression and destruction in Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia is willing to directly conclude a treaty with Italy.

Shanghai News: MacArthur Headquarters officially issued an export order to the Japanese government on the 16th. Bickel, director of the Foreign Trade Division of the headquarters, announced: "Japan and Asian countries will resume trade by the end of the year. Trade delegations from China, Burma, Singapore, the Malayan Federation, and Hong Kong have agreed on measures to purchase textiles and other goods from Japan."

Various reports: Truman announced the abolition of meat price controls starting on the 15th. The day after the controls were lifted, meat prices doubled. This move has aroused sharp opposition from American progressives.

Bucharest News: The Romanian Council of Ministers met on the 15th and decided to hold general elections on November 19th.

Sofia News: The Bulgarian general election will be held on the 27th of this month. The election campaign has vigorously unfolded last week. Two hundred election rallies have been held nationwide, with 300,000 participants, unanimously supporting the Fatherland Front.

Tokyo News: Employees of the Japanese film and theater industry launched a strike on the 16th in response to the General Federation of Japanese Industry Unions' October Offensive. Shochiku, Toho, and Daiei, the three major film production companies, have gone on strike. Major cinemas and theaters in Tokyo have closed.

New Delhi News: The Indian Interim Government issued a communiqué on the 15th stating that British Viceroy Wavell has appointed five cabinet ministers from the Muslim League to the government, who will serve as ministers of Legislation, Postal Services, and Aviation.
