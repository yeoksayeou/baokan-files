Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. Duolun and Guyuan in the eastern part of Chahar Province, and Shangdu in the west, remain peaceful and tranquil. Local political bandits have been annihilated one by one. The Mongolian and Han people's armed forces of Duolun recently eradicated a group of Chiang Kai-shek's political bandits who had fled from Rehe Province into the county. The notorious bandit leader Han Desheng, "Mongolian Old Seven," Jiu Jiang, and 113 other cavalry bandits were all annihilated. The local people's armed forces seized more than 90 warhorses and 70 rifles and pistols. The more than 100 civilian horses and a large amount of property looted by the bandits have all been recovered and returned to their original owners. More than 300 men of the Li Jinye unit under the pseudo-bandit Wang Ying, dispatched by Fu Zuoyi, sneaked into Dazhuang Village, more than 20 miles north of Xinghe, on the evening of the 28th of last month and were also routed by the local militia, who captured nine pseudo-bandits alive and seized 10 rifles and nine warhorses.
