　　Developing Private Investment to Strengthen Industrial and Commercial Construction
    Changzhi City Holds Managers' Meeting
    Mayor Yang Points Out That the People's Liberation Does Not Hinder the Development of Industry and Commerce; Businessmen and People Further Understand the Policy and Eliminate All Concerns
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 26th] (Late arrival) On the 18th of last month, the Changzhi Municipal Government convened a meeting of managers from more than 50 privately-owned shops to discuss the government's policies on developing private capital and developing industry and commerce. The meeting concluded on the 20th. At the meeting, Mayor Yang, after explaining the government's industrial and commercial policies, specifically pointed out that the people's liberation and the development of industry and commerce are not contradictory. Without the people's liberation, the liberated areas would lose their foundation. Similarly, without the development of industry and commerce, the liberated areas would not prosper. He called on everyone to dispel ideological concerns, speak their minds freely, and express their opinions to the fullest extent in order to solve various problems. Manager Zhang Zhi said with emotion, "Previously, our associates opened a small shop on East Street. Before the mass movement even started, they heard about the struggles here and were afraid of future problems, so they closed the shop and dispersed. Looking at it today, it was because they had guilty consciences, not because the mass movement was bad." Manager Ma Baoliu said, "The masses did settle accounts with me, but after the problem was resolved, I continued to do my business. The mass struggle settled accounts with my past feudal exploitation, but it didn't prevent me from doing business." After such discussions, everyone unanimously recognized the content of the mass movement and was no longer afraid. Manager Cheng of Taihe Sauce Garden further compared the past and the present, saying, "In the past, we didn't dare walk in the dark, and we didn't dare carry money on us. But today, doors are not locked at night, and no one picks up lost items on the road. There isn't a single beggar. How reassuring it is to do business! If the masses hadn't been mobilized, how could things be so good?" Speaking about the issue of cooperation between owners and employees, Manager Qu Huanwen said, "If you want to use shop assistants, you must first be considerate of them and help them solve their difficulties. The approach should be democratic, and don't put on airs and oppress people. In this way, the shop assistants will work hard. This is a win-win situation." The small vendors also clarified their business principles, which should be to buy and sell quickly, sell when there is a profit, increase turnover, and gradually expand capital. Finally, everyone raised many specific opinions on issues such as merchants' conscription, burden issues, rent issues, and the care of the commercial sector in future mass movements. The government gave satisfactory answers to each of these issues. Because everyone clarified the government's policy of developing private capital, at the end of the meeting, they all drew up concrete plans for their future development and made four guarantees to the government: (1) Resolutely implement government laws and regulations. (2) Do not engage in speculation and hoarding, do not disrupt finance, do not buy and sell contraband, and guarantee genuine goods at fair prices and fair transactions. (3) Eliminate feudal exploitation, do not treat shop assistants harshly, achieve cooperation between owners and employees, and unite for profit. (4) Publicize industrial and commercial policies at all times, mobilize private investment, develop private capital, increase the wealth of the liberated areas, and prosper the market. After the meeting, everyone unanimously said that with such good government policies, they must boldly develop their businesses, and they asked the government to hold more meetings in the future to educate everyone, open up their minds, and solve their difficulties.

　　发展私人投资加强工商建设
    长治市召开经理会议
    杨市长指出群众翻身不碍发展工商商民进一步体会政策解除一切顾虑
    【本报长治二十六日电】（迟到）上月十八日长治市政府召集私营商店五十余家的经理会议，研讨政府发展私人资本及发展工商业的政策。会议于廿日结束，会上杨市长在阐明政府工商业政策后，特别指出群众翻身与发展工商业是不矛盾的，群众不翻身，解放区要失去依靠，同样，工商业不发达，解放区也不会繁荣。他号召大家解除思想顾虑，有啥说啥，尽量发言，以便解决各种问题。张治经理感动的说：“以前我们伙计在东街开个小铺，群众运动还没开始，听说这里斗争，自己怕将来出岔子，就闭门散伙了。今天看来，是自己怀了鬼胎，并不是群众运动不好。”马保六经理说：“群众曾向我清算过，但问题解决以后，我仍然做我的买卖。群众斗争是清算了我过去封建剥削部分，并不是不让做生意。”经过这样讨论，大家都一致认识到群众运动的内容，都不害怕了。太和酱园程经理更以过去和现在作对比说：“过去时走路不敢走黑，身上不敢带款，今天呢，夜不闭户，道不拾遗，没有一个要饭的，做生意有多安心！不是发动了群众，那会这样好？”说到东伙合作问题，璩焕文经理说：“要用店员，就先得体贴店员，给他解决困难，方式要民主，不要摆架子压迫人，这样店员就会好好干，这是两好合一好。”小摊贩们也明确了自己的营业方针，应当是随买随卖，见利就卖，多周转，慢慢扩大资金。最后，大家对商人支差问题、负担问题、租额问题及今后在群众运动中对商业部分的照顾问题，都提出了许多具体意见。政府均分别予以满意答复。由于大家明确了政府发展私人资本的政策，在会议结束时，都订出了自己今后发展的具体计划，并对政府提出四点保证：（一）坚决执行政府法令。（二）不投机囤积，不捣乱金融，不买卖违禁物品，保证货真价实，交易公平。（三）取消封建剥削，不苛待店员，作到东伙合作，团结营利。（四）随时宣传工商政策，动员私人投资，发展私人资本，增加解放区财富，繁荣市场。会后，大家一致说政府有这样好的政策，一定要大胆发展，并要求政府以后多开会教育大家，打通思想，解决困难。
