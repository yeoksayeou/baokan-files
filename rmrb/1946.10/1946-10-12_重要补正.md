　　Important Correction
    In the Liberation Daily editorial "Anti-Sovietism is Just a Smoke Screen" published in this newspaper on the 10th, more than 30 words were missing. It should read: "… and said: 'Believes that the Soviet Union is secretly supporting the Chinese Communist Party leader in undermining the ceasefire agreement signed by the Communist Party and Ambassador Marshall, as well as the Beiping Military Mediation Group.' (The preceding quotations are all from the United Press…)." Also, the sentence "They demand that remote places and foreign countries become 'friendly' governments" in the second paragraph should be changed to "They demand remote bases and pressure foreign countries to establish 'friendly' governments." The sentence "but America's colonization has advanced to the point of establishing the position of an inferior American conqueror" in the third paragraph should be changed to "but America has become a colony. In order to establish America's position as such a conqueror," We hereby make this correction.
    Also: The original headline of the third news item on the second page of this newspaper on October 11 was: "Slow Progress" in the mass movement in the Third District of Linzhang, which was mistakenly printed as "Stopped" progress. We hereby correct this.

　　重要补正
    十日本报所载解放日报社论《反苏不过是烟幕》一文，其中缺三十余字，应为“………又说：“相信苏联正在秘密支持中国共产党领袖，破坏共党与马使所订之停战协定及北平之军事调处小组。”（前面的引语，均见合众社………）”。又该文第二段中“他们要求遥远的地方和外国成为‘友好’政府”一句，应改为“他们要求遥远的基地，压迫外国成立‘友好’政府”。第三段中“而是美国的殖民地化进到建立美国劣种征服者的地位”一句，应改为“而是美国的殖民地了。为了建立美国这种征服者的地位，”特此补正。
    又：十月十一日本报第二版第三条新闻标题原为：临漳三区群运“迟滞”，误排“停”滞，特此更正。
