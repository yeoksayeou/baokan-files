The basic characteristics of the new French Constitution, which was approved by French citizens in a referendum on the 13th, are five: (1) Guaranteeing full freedom and rights for the people. (2) National power rests with the National Assembly. (3) Recognizing that the French mainland and the various French colonies are equal. (4) Abolishing private monopolies of large enterprises. (5) Provisions regarding French sovereignty (not engaging in wars of conquest or aggression).

The difference between the Fourth Republic's Constitution and the 1875 Constitution, besides other aspects, lies primarily in the realm of political power. The old constitution stipulated that legislative power belonged to the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, and the President, with the government responsible to both houses. The constitutional draft rejected on May 5th stipulated a unicameral system (abolishing the Senate), with all power belonging to a single National Assembly.

The current new constitution is basically an amendment to the previous rejected constitutional draft, with the rights of the President increased to a limited extent and the Senate restored. However, it largely maintains the spirit of the original draft in other aspects, which is the reason why De Gaulle and his faction opposed it.

　　法国新宪基本特点
    按：十三日被法国公民复决所批准之法兰西第四共和国新宪法的基本特点有五：（一）保证人民的充分自由权利。（二）国家基本大权操之于国民议会。（三）承认法国本部与法国各殖民地民族一律平等。（四）废除大企业的私人垄断。（五）关于法国主权的规定，（不作任何征服侵犯性质的战争）。
    第四共和国宪法与一八七五年宪法不同者，除其他方面外，在政权方面主要为旧宪规定立法权属于参众两院及总统，政府对两院负责。而前次于五月五日被否决的宪草则规定为一院制（废除参院），一切权力属一院国会。
    此次新宪基本上为前次被否决宪草之修正案，有限地提高了总统权利与恢复了参院，但在其他方面大致保持原草案的精神，这就是戴高乐及其一派反对它的理由。
