　　Forgetting Neither Old nor New Grievances, Vow to Defeat Bandit Chiang
    Taihang People Eagerly Enlist
    Communist Party Members from An'yang XX Village Swear Oath to the Party Flag Before Departing
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi, 21st] Under the slogan "Total Resistance, Thoroughly Defeat Chiang Kai-shek," the enlistment movement in the entire Taihang area is becoming increasingly heated. In An'yang alone, nearly 1,500 outstanding young men have gone to the front lines in the past three days. Ren Shouqing, director of the Xiqingliu Farmers' Association in the Third District, Zhou Taibao, director of the Yaoborun Farmers' Association, village chief Wang Erqin and other cadres, a total of forty-two people, have all taken the lead in enlisting before the masses. Among them, twelve are members of the Chinese Communist Party. Under the slogan "Communist Party members must stand at the forefront of the people's struggle" put forward by the Party Committee, these Party members not only took the lead in enlisting themselves, but also actively mobilized the masses and other cadres to go to the front lines together. Influenced by the exemplary actions of Party members taking the lead in enlisting, 389 people signed up on the first night in the Second District. When Party members from Village XX welcomed them into the army, they saluted the red flag and said, "For national independence, for the growth of the Party, and for the interests of the masses, we are willing to fight the enemy to the death!" Workers in the Liuhegou mining area, under the call of Comrade Ding Zhenhua, also had workers such as Wang Changyou and others sign up for the army. They said, "If we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous offensive, workers will have no good times!" When the people of Huguan heard the news of Chiang's army attacking northern Henan, they unanimously expressed their desire to take revenge on Chiang Kai-shek and make a final reckoning. The women said with gritted teeth: "We can no longer live the inhuman lives of the past few years! It's hard to turn ourselves around. Let our men all go and fight! Tell them that they must hold off Chiang Kai-shek. If Chiang Kai-shek and the Americans come, we will have no chance to live!" After recalling the atrocities committed by Chiang's army against women three or four years ago, they immediately persuaded their men, and twenty-one young men quickly came out to join the army. Cui Fulong from Guo Jiatuo Village said angrily: "My father was killed by the Central Army in 1942! The Eighth Route Army had just saved my family, and Chiang Kai-shek came to kill us again! I remember it! If I don't avenge this today, I won't be able to face my father in the afterlife!" After pushing the village cadre to write his name on the new recruit registration book, he said, breathing rapidly, "Let's wait and see! If Chiang's army is not defeated, I will never come back!" In the county's first district, 390 young people signed up for the army within three days. Under the slogan of "Rather die than be a subjugated people," 2,484 people in Xingtai enlisted in the army within three days. At the enlistment meeting in Xixiaoguo Village in the county, Ma, an old woman, held her only second son's hand and cried: "Your elder brother was in the Eighth Route Army and made great contributions in fighting the Japanese, but he was killed by that beast Chiang Kai-shek for no reason! He and you were born from the same womb, what's the point of living if I can't avenge this!" Zhao Demu, from Zhongwang Village in Shahe, who was robbed by the puppet army's Tie Mutou, said: "Old Tiezi has become the Central Army, the Central Army and Old Tiezi are one family, if those bastards come, we can forget about living! We have to fight!" Zhao Fazi, who had been a hired laborer for more than ten years and had only recently turned himself around, said: "Chairman Mao just led us to turn ourselves around, and Chiang Kai-shek is coming to oppress us again. We just drove away the old emperor led by Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek is bringing in the Americans. If Chairman Mao doesn't give us guns, we will have to fight old Chiang with shovels!" Under the extreme hatred for the traitors, Zhao Wancai, who was forty-five years old, also joined the army. He said, "I can't fight, but I can be a cook," but when he was dissuaded by the cadre, he said, "If you don't let me join the army, I will follow the army wherever it goes!" In Xiangyuan's first district, 188 people signed up in two days. Zhang Shun, a postal worker at the Gucheng post office in Wuxiang, also requested to join the army and go to the front line of self-defense. In Changzhi, the number of young people who have voluntarily signed up for the army in the past four days has reached 2,624. After the Fourth District held a meeting of activists, 500 young people signed up for the army in three days.
