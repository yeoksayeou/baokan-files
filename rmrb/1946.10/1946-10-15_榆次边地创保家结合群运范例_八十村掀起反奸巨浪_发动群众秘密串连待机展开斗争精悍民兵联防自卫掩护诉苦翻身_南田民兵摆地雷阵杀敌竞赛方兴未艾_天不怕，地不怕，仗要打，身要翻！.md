Fear Nothing in Heaven or Earth, Fight the War, Overturn Our Lives!

    [Yuci News from Our Newspaper] The masses in the Yuci border area have created a brilliant model of combining patriotic home defense and self-defense warfare, vigorously carrying out the struggle against special agents, traitors, local bullies, and evil landlords. In the past, people thought it impossible to mobilize the masses in villages three to five *li* from the city, but now a vigorous anti-traitor liquidation movement has been launched, rapidly destroying the reactionary rule and reclaiming a large amount of land that had been plundered. More than eighty administrative villages have all been involved. The ×× village, with more than forty households and more than two hundred people, has now organized a peasant association of fifty people and a militia team of twenty-nine people, and has developed mutual aid production and women's textile work. Their slogans are "Fight the war, overturn our lives!" "Fear nothing in heaven or earth, fear neither bullies nor traitors!" The headquarters leading the war in each village is also the headquarters leading the liberation struggle. On the one hand, they vigorously organize sentry posts, intelligence, reconnaissance, undercover agents, and surveillance to guard against the enemy, and regularly send small and elite militia self-defense teams to penetrate deep behind enemy lines to contain their activities, and implement joint defense among the villages, hitting the invading enemy from different routes, and protecting the safe transfer of the masses; on the other hand, they spare no effort to publicize the news of our army's victory, mobilize the masses, secretly speak grievances, and liaise with each other. When the time is ripe, they suddenly convene mass meetings to launch a struggle against the traitors and bullies, expose the crimes of the traitors and special agents, and eliminate all of Yan Xishan's hidden claws. In order to carry out the work in an orderly manner, the headquarters has an armed defense section, a war preparation and traitor removal section, a propaganda section, a consolation and restoration section (to console the masses after each war, solve difficulties, and restore order), and a grievance speaking and accounting committee, concentrating efforts to mobilize the masses to struggle, settle accounts, and distribute the fruits of victory, etc. And through the decision of the masses, a system supported by the public is implemented: (1) Everyone must attend meetings. (2) Everyone must move when acting. (3) The village is the unit for sleeping outside collectively. (4) Five households jointly guarantee each other, and households communicate intelligence with each other. When Yan's puppet troops invade, each group of households informs the next household, and the entire village can take action immediately. The special agents and traitors who have been overthrown are also under the supervision of the masses and follow the action, with no exceptions. Intelligence is also very well-informed between villages and districts, so they rarely suffer losses. They have created various new forms of struggle in the struggle. In luring, harassing, attacking, besieging, and many flexible enemy-fighting tactics, the masses simultaneously overthrow the traitors, special agents, and evil bullies in the village, and carry out liberation. After the struggle, the fruits are distributed to the masses as soon as possible, and if the enemy situation is tight, the masses can each carry their own belongings, and there is no loss at all, so the morale of the masses has been high. And the Yan's puppet troops in the tortoise shell are getting more and more depressed. Yan's × company commander once said to a "Yan's" special agent who was recently captured by us: "The people of Yuci are all against old Yan, I don't think we will occupy it for long!" This can represent the general mood within Yan's puppet troops. (Shi Pingtao)

    [Changzhi News from Our Newspaper] In order to respond to the Yan's puppet army's frenzied slaughter and attack, the Yuci military and civilians are now launching a heat wave of enemy-killing competition. The Yan army Zhao Chengzhou's troops stationed in the area of Beiheliu Railway Station in Yuci have invaded our liberated areas for days. Since the late last month, they have captured 278 men, women, old and young, and slaughtered more than 20 people, arousing the common indignation of the military and civilians of the entire county, who have put forward the idea of avenging the dead and launched an enemy-killing competition. The slogans are "The more frenzied Yan's army is, the harder we must be," and "Each person guarantees to kill or capture one Yan's puppet soldier after autumn this year." The Nantian militia self-defense team immediately set up a landmine array and killed nine Yan soldiers in one fell swoop. Many masses in Niufang, Yangfang, Jima, Zhuangzi and other villages insisted on fighting alongside the independent battalion and militia rotation teams. In a battle to repel the Yan army's invasion of Zhuangzi, two Yan soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than ten *shi* of grain and two livestock were intercepted. This movement is now developing with an unstoppable momentum. (Shi Pingtao)

    天不怕，地不怕，仗要打，身要翻！
    【本报榆次讯】榆次边地群众创造了结合爱国保家自卫战争，猛烈开展反特务汉奸恶霸地主斗争的光辉范例。过去人们认为不能发动离城三五里地村庄的群众，现在均已掀起如火如荼的反奸清算运动，将反动统治迅速摧垮，夺回被掠去的大量土地。八十多个行政村，全部卷入。××村四十多户，二百多人口，现已组织起五十人的农会与二十九人的民兵队，发展了互助生产与妇女纺织。他们的口号是“仗要打，身要翻！”“天不怕，地不怕，恶霸汉奸都不怕！”各村领导战争的指挥部，同时就是领导翻身斗争的指挥部。一方面大力组织好岗哨、情报、侦察、坐探、监视警戒敌人，经常派出短小精悍的民兵自卫队深入敌后牵制活动，并实行各村联防，分路打击出犯的敌人，掩护群众安全转移；另方面不遗余力地宣传我军胜利消息，发动群众、秘密诉苦、互相串通，在时机成熟时突然召开群众大会向奸霸展开斗争，揭露奸霸特务的罪恶，肃清一切阎锡山潜藏的爪牙。为了使工作进行得有条不紊，指挥部中设有武装保卫股、备战除奸股、宣传股、慰问恢复股（每次战争后慰问群众，解决困难，恢复秩序）、另设一诉苦清账委员会，集中力量发动群众斗争、算账、分配果实等。并经群众决定，实行着一种为大众所拥护的制度：（一）开会时要到都到。（二）行动时要走都走。（三）以村为单位集体到外面睡觉。（四）五家联环保，户与户通情报。阎伪来犯，各组一户传一户，马上就能全村行动。被斗倒的特务汉奸也均在群众监督下随着行动，不敢例外。在村与村、区与区之间，情报也非常灵通，所以他们很少吃亏。他们在斗争中创造了各种新的斗争方式。在诱骗袭扰，打击围困许多灵活的对敌斗争中，同时群众就斗倒了村中的奸特恶霸，进行翻身。斗争以后，果实均尽快分给群众，敌情一紧，群众各带各的，一点也损失不了，所以群众情绪一直高涨。而乌龟壳里的阎伪军，却一天天更加苦闷，阎部×连长曾对一个最近被我捕获的“阎记”特务说：“榆次老百姓都和老阎作对，我看咱们怎么也占不长！”这可以代表阎伪内部一般的情绪。（史平涛）
    【本报长治讯】榆次军民为回答阎伪军疯狂屠杀进攻，现正掀起一杀敌竞赛热潮。驻榆次北合流车站一带阎军赵承绶部，连日进犯我解放区，上月下旬以来，共抓走男女老少二百七十八名，屠杀二十余名，激起全县军民共愤，纷纷提出为死者复仇，展开杀敌竞赛。口号是“阎军越疯狂，咱们越要硬”，“今年秋后每人保证杀死或活捉一个阎伪军。”南田民兵自卫队员马上摆起地雷阵，一次炸死阎军九名。牛方、杨方、季麻、庄子等村很多群众，非跟独立营、民兵轮战队一起打仗不可，在打退阎军进犯庄子的一次战斗中，毙伤阎军两名，截回粮食十余石，牲畜两头。这一运动，现正以方兴未艾之势往前发展着。（史平涛）
