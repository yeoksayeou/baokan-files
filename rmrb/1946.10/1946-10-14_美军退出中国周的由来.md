The Origin of "U.S. Troops Out of China Week"

	"U.S. Troops Out of China Week" is a broad mass movement demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. It originated from the "U.S. Troops Out of China Week" held in thirty-five major American cities from September 22nd to 28th of this year, with 450,000 people participating. It was launched by two major progressive American organizations—the Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy.

	After this news reached our country, ten major people's organizations in Shanghai initiated the "U.S. Troops Out of China" movement on September 23rd, and resolved not to stop until the U.S. troops withdrew from China. People's organizations in Hong Kong and Chongqing also rose up in response. Since then, the "U.S. Troops Out of China" movement has flourished in major cities across the country.

　　美军退出中国周的由来
    “退出中国周”是要求美军退出中国的一个广泛的群众运动，起源于今年九月二十二日至二十八日在美国三十五个主要城市所举行的“退出中国周”，参加这一运动的人数达四十五万。是由美国两大进步团体——争取和平委员会及民主远东政策委员会所发动。
    这一消息传至我国后，上海十大人民团体于九月二十三日发起“美军退出中国”运动，并决定不至美军退出中国不停止。港渝人民团体也起而响应。从此“美军退出中国”运动即在全国各主要城市蓬勃开展。
