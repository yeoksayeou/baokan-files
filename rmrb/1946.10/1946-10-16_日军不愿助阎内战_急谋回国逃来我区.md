[Changzhi Dispatch from this newspaper on the 12th] Lieutenant Uchida Sakio, a Japanese infantry and artillery instructor in Yan’s “Training Corps” in Taiyuan, fled to the Liberated Area last month, requesting to be sent back to his country. According to him, the lower-ranking Japanese officers and soldiers remaining in Shanxi have realized that helping Yan Xishan fight the civil war will lead nowhere. They are eager to return home as soon as possible, but Yan Xishan has used various excuses to detain them. He was detained for requesting to return home, and this time he took the opportunity to flee to the Liberated Area. He also said that Yamaoka, the former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in Shanxi, and Motoizumi Kaoru, the commander of the 14th Infantry Brigade, are still in the training corps, helping Yan Xishan train civil war military cadres.
