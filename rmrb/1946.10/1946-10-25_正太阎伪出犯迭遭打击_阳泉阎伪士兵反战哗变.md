　　Zhengtai Puppet Troops' Offensives Repeatedly Thwarted
    Yangquan Puppet Soldiers Mutiny Against War
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 22nd dispatch] The puppet troops of Yan Xishan along the Zhengtai Railway have been continuously launching offensives in recent days, all of which have been repelled by our guerrilla forces. The morale of the Yan Xishan puppet troops is low, and the soldiers are weary of war. Some have already begun to mutiny. On the 17th, over 300 Yan Xishan puppet troops from the Dongzhao stronghold in Yuci launched an offensive against Changning Town and were repelled by our armed work team, with seven enemy soldiers killed or wounded. On the same night, the Yan Xishan "Revenge Squad" from the Duanting Station in Shouyang County invaded Xidoufa Village and were repelled by a unit of our Independent Battalion militia. The commander of the "Revenge Squad" was killed. On the 17th, over 500 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops from the three locations of Niangziguan, Mohetan, and Jingxing simultaneously launched offensives against our Jiuguan, Hetaoyuan, and Huaishupu areas, all of which were repelled by the defending troops. The anti-war sentiment among Yan Xishan puppet army soldiers is increasing daily. On the 16th, in a blockhouse near Yangquan Railway Station (under the jurisdiction of Pingding), a squad from the 10th Column of the Yan Xishan puppet army, four soldiers staged an anti-civil war mutiny, killing the squad leader and deputy squad leader, burning down the blockhouse, and defecting to the Liberated Area with one small cannon, six rifles, and some ammunition.
