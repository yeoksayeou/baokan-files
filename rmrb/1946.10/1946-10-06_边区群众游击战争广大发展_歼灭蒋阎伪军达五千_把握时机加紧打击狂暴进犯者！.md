[Reported from this newspaper's Handan office on the 4th] According to incomplete statistics, the border region militia and guerrillas, on various self-defense fronts, have engaged in approximately 2,000 battles against Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops in the past month, killing, wounding, and capturing over 5,000 invading officers and soldiers, and removing 12 important strongholds, including Zihongkou and Hongshan Town. These significant victories were accumulated from one small victory after another: the Anyang militia in the Taihang Mountains fought 75 battles in one day, killing, wounding, and capturing 107 Chiang and puppet troops (including several Chiang army platoon leaders), and removing five large and small strongholds. The Peitong County (newly established county, formed by merging parts of Pei County and Tongshan (Xuzhou)) militia in the JiluYu region fought over 30 battles in 20 days, killing, wounding, and capturing 42 Chiang soldiers, and seizing 23 long and short guns, and 300 bags of military rice. The Minquan and Kaocheng militias, in the three days from the 23rd to the 26th, killed, wounded, and captured 32 Chiang and puppet troops, and seized 30 rifles and carbines. The Qibin County militia killed and wounded 10 Chiang soldiers in one day on the 27th. The Huolu County militia in the Taihang Mountains killed and wounded several Chiang and puppet troops in one battle, including a company commander, and liberated over 1,000 civilians detained by the Chiang army. In another battle, Liang Dezhu, the director of the Kuomintang Huolu County Rehabilitation Association (Support Bureau), was captured. When there is a favorable opportunity, the militia and guerrillas do not easily let go of small-scale annihilation battles: the Tongan militia annihilated a short-gun squad of the Chiang army in one instance; the Anyang militia killed, wounded, and captured all 38 members of the puppet Wang Zibu in one instance; and on the night of the 20th, the Linzhang County completely annihilated over 300 members of the invading puppet Wang Zibu. In September, the mass guerrilla warfare throughout the border region expanded further with the Chiang army's frantic invasion: the southern line stretched westward from Maojindu in Pinglu, southern Shanxi, through northern Henan, southwestern Shandong, all the way to the vicinity of Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu. The northern line, centered on Jingxing Niangziguan, extended east and west, directly approaching Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan. The guerrilla warfare on both sides of the Pu, Pinghan lines, and the eastern Henan plains is also developing unprecedentedly.

　　边区群众游击战争广大发展
    歼灭蒋阎伪军达五千
    把握时机加紧打击狂暴进犯者！
    【本报邯郸四日电】据不完整统计，边区民兵游击队在各个自卫战线上，一个月来，与蒋阎伪作战约二千次，毙伤俘进犯军官兵在五千人以上，拔除子洪口、洪善镇等重要据点十二个。这些重大战果，都是由一次一次小的胜利积垒而成：太行安阳民兵，一日作战七十五次，毙伤俘蒋伪军一百零七名（其中并有蒋军排长数名）拔除大小据点五个。冀鲁豫沛铜县（新设县，即沛县与铜山（徐州）各一部划成）民兵，二十天内作战三十余次，毙伤俘蒋军四十二名，缴获长短枪二十三枝，军用大米三百袋。民权、考城民兵自二十三至二十六日三天内，即毙伤俘蒋伪军三十二名，获步马枪三十枝。齐滨县民兵，二十七日一天内毙伤蒋军十名。太行获鹿县民兵一次战斗，毙伤蒋伪军数名，其中有连长一人，并解放被蒋军扣押的民夫千余名。在又一次战斗中，俘获国民党获鹿县复员协会（支应局）理事长梁德柱。在一定有利时机，民兵游击队也不轻易放过小规模的歼灭战的：同安民兵一次歼灭了蒋军一个短枪班；安阳民兵一次毙伤俘伪王自全部三十八人；临漳县二十日一夜，更将进犯的伪王自全部一部三百余人全部消灭了。九月份，全边区的群众游击战争，随着蒋军的疯狂进犯，是愈益扩大了：南线西自晋南平陆茅津渡、经豫北、鲁西南、一直延伸至苏北的徐州附近。北线以井陉娘子关为中心向东西伸展，直逼石家庄与太原附近。他如同蒲、平汉线两侧及豫东平原的游击战，也都是空前的发展着。
