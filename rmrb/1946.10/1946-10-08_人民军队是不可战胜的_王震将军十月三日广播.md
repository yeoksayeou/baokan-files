Comrades throughout the country! The 359th Brigade, which broke through from the Central Plains, has now victoriously arrived in Yan'an after countless heroic bloody battles, breaking through the encirclement, pursuit, and blocking actions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops led by Liu Zhi and Hu Zongnan.

In 1944, the liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party were achieving continuous victories in the war against the enemy and puppet forces. However, the Kuomintang army's main battlefields – Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou – were retreating step by step under the enemy and puppet forces' attacks, and vast territories fell into the hands of the enemy and puppet forces. The people of the whole country placed their hopes of stopping the enemy's advance and quickly defeating Japanese imperialism on the army led by the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, the 359th Brigade, which had 30 mu of land per person in Nanniwan, was ordered to go south to resist Japan.

During the southward expedition to resist Japan, we broke through the enemy and puppet troops' heavy blockades and wiped out a large number of enemies who came out to block and fight. Although our operations were arduous, we were constantly warmly welcomed, comforted, loved, and assisted by the people in the liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas of North China and Central China. This made us feel that our actions to be loyal to the Chinese nation and the liberation of the people were the supreme glory! After a long march of thousands of miles, we finally fought to Hunan and Guangdong.

After the Japanese invaders surrendered, we suffered from the "encirclement and suppression" by Xue Yue, Yu Hanmou and other troops. Because we implemented the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's policy of avoiding civil war and striving for peace, democracy, and unity, we reluctantly bid farewell to the people of Hunan and Guangdong and withdrew to the Central Plains, where we joined forces with General Li Xiannian of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army and General Wang Shusheng of Henan.

However, after the signing of the Double Tenth Agreement, Chiang Kai-shek, who was untrustworthy and violated the agreement, launched a large-scale civil war. The Central Plains Military Region suffered a large-scale siege by the Kuomintang army. Our troops in the Central Plains, under the command of General Li Xiannian, inflicted severe blows on the Chiang army. On January 10 this year, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party issued a ceasefire order with the participation of the United States, and the ceasefire began. Unexpectedly, with the aid of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek still violated the ceasefire order in the same way. Even after the Luoshan and Hankou agreements, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive never stopped.

In late June, Chiang Kai-shek ordered a full-scale annihilation of the Central Plains Military Region troops. During this period, we clearly realized the ugly face of the American reactionaries assisting Chiang Kai-shek in expanding the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek selling out territorial sovereignty and using American weapons to slaughter compatriots.

In this siege of the Central Plains Military Region, Chiang Kai-shek dispatched ten armies, including the 18th Army, the 75th Army, the 72nd Army, the 26th Army, the 66th Army, the 41st Army, the 47th Army, the 48th Army, the 15th Army, and the 10th Army, as well as a dozen or so security regiments. Moreover, he mobilized laborers in dozens of counties, demolished ancestral halls, temples, and many civilian houses, and cut down fruit trees to build thousands of bunkers. The troops were equipped with American and Japanese weapons, and Colonel Caleef, an American Air Force Colonel who had participated in the execution group, was hired to train the Air Force in Hankou.

The Chiang army launched a large-scale offensive on June 26, with Xuanhuadian, the location of General Li Xiannian's headquarters, as the encirclement and joint attack point. In order to survive, our army was forced to defend itself. Under the command of General Li Xiannian, after resisting, we resolutely and bravely broke through on June 29th and 30th. In the self-defense counterattack for survival, our army captured officers of the 15th Army and seized Chiang Kai-shek's hand-written order to Liu Zhi. We learned that Chiang Kai-shek's vicious plan to completely annihilate the Central Plains CCP troops was the beginning of a full-scale civil war; we learned that Chiang Kai-shek dreamed of annihilating General Li Xiannian's more than 60,000 troops in the Central Plains within 48 hours, creating a so-called "amazing victory and miracle". Chiang Kai-shek's dream was completely shattered by our army's victorious breakthrough. In the captured documents, it was discovered that Chiang Kai-shek's army had provided the US military advisors with the bunkers they had built and the training and combat plans after re-equipping with American weapons. American personnel clearly knew that Chiang Kai-shek wanted to annihilate us, but they pretended to be ignorant and allowed them to annihilate us. This is the so-called "mediation" of the United States. We saw with our own eyes the evidence of the collusion between the US and Chiang Kai-shek, and we saw with our own eyes that Chiang Kai-shek told the Americans all of his military secrets. We were furious!

The fundamental reason for our army's victory in this breakthrough is that all the officers and soldiers of our army recognized Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of faith, his selling out of the country and harming the people, and recognized the US imperialists' armed intervention in China's internal affairs, which aroused our army's high spirit of patriotism and heroism.

After Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement and annihilation failed, he mobilized five more armies, including the 1st Army, the 90th Army, the 76th Army, the 36th Army, and the 14th Army from Sichuan, in an attempt to annihilate our army on the border of Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi. However, Chiang Kai-shek failed again. In the battle with the 90th Army, we captured Chiang Kai-shek's order to Zhao Xitian's army. The order said: Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, Chen Shaochong and others must be captured alive, and our army must be completely annihilated; if the task cannot be accomplished, all generals will be severely punished and punished by military law. Chiang Kai-shek was confident that he could win the war by relying on the US imperialism's supply of military equipment and materials, as well as training, command, and other assistance, plus his fascist military and political orders. But what was the result? Now, Chiang's 10th Army, 41st Army, 47th Army, and 1st Army, which were chasing us, have all been punished. However, it was not Chiang Kai-shek who punished these troops, but the ever-victorious army in the self-defense war of the liberated areas, the troops of our General Liu Bocheng and General Chen Geng, who captured Chiang Kai-shek's direct line generals Zhao Xitian, Huang Zhengcheng and others, and annihilated the troops. The chasing and blocking troops sent by Chiang Kai-shek were either annihilated, wounded, dragged down by illness, or deserted, and the reduction in personnel was more than half.

Now, the Pi Dingjun Brigade of our army's Wang Shusheng's troops has already arrived in the Suwan Liberated Area, and the 359th Brigade and a part of the Fifth Division have also returned to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The remaining troops are still surviving in the vast areas of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, among the broad masses of the people.

In the past two years, the 359th Brigade has marched north and south across the mountains and rivers of the motherland for 22,000 miles, passing through eight provinces, bravely defeating the Japanese invaders, Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek, and overcoming the severe cold, heat, and natural obstacles of rivers and mountains. This proves that the army under the banner of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, in the war against foreign imperialist aggression, in the war to defeat the traitors and reactionaries, can withstand severe tests, and the patriotic and heroic people's army is always invincible!

　　人民军队是不可战胜的
    王震将军十月三日广播
    全国同胞们！从中原突围的三五九旅，经过了无数次英勇的血战，打破了蒋军刘峙、胡宗南等部的围歼、追击、堵战，现在已经胜利的到达延安了。
    民国三十三年，中共领导的解放区战场，在进攻敌伪的战争中节节胜利，但是国民党军队的正面战场——河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、贵州，却在敌伪进攻之下，节节溃退，广大国土沦陷在敌伪手里，全国人民把停止敌人进攻、迅速打败日本帝国主义的希望放在中国共产党领导的军队身上，于是在南泥湾每人种有三十亩土地的三五九旅，就奉令南下抗日了。
    在南下抗日征途中，我们冲破了敌伪军的重重封锁，消灭了出击堵战大量的敌人。我们的作战虽然艰苦，但是我们却不断地受到华北、华中各解放区和敌占区人民热烈的欢迎、慰问、爱戴、援助，使我们感到忠于中国民族与人民解放的行动是无上的光荣！我们经历了万里的南征，终于打到湖南和广东。
    日寇投降以后，我们遭受了薛岳、余汉谋等部的“围剿”，我们因为执行中共中央避免内战、争取和平民主团结的方针，忍痛告别了湖南和广东的人民，撤回到中原来，并且和新四军第五师李先念将军、河南王树声将军的部队会合了。
    可是，双十协定签订后，背信违约的蒋介石，发动了大规模的内战，中原军区遭受国民党军队的大举围攻，我们中原的部队在李先念将军指挥下，给予蒋军严重的打击。到了今年一月十日，国共两党又发布了停战令，并有美国参加，始行停战。想不到蒋介石在美国援助之下，对停战令还是同样的破坏，甚至在罗山、汉口协议之后，蒋介石的进攻还是一直没有停止过。
    六月下旬，蒋介石更下令全面围歼中原军区部队。在这一时期中，我们清楚地认识了美国反动派援助蒋介石扩大中国内战以及蒋介石出卖领土主权、用美国武器屠杀同胞的丑恶面目。
    蒋介石这次围攻中原军区，出动兵力有第十八军、第七十五军、第七十二军、第二十六军、第六十六军、第四十一军、第四十七军、第四十八军、第十五军、第十军共十个军和十几个保安团，而且在几十个县的范围内征调民夫，拆毁祠堂庙宇和很多民房，砍伐果木树建立了上千个碉堡，部队均为美械和日械的装备，聘请曾经参加执行小组的美方代表古来福空军上校在汉口训练空军。
    蒋军在六月二十六日开始了大举进攻，以李先念将军司令部所在地宣化店为围攻合击点。我军为了生存，被迫自卫，在李先念将军指挥下，经过抗击后，在六月二十九号、三十号实行坚决英勇的突围战。在为生存自卫的突击中，我军俘虏了十五军军官，缴获蒋介石给刘峙的手令，知道了蒋介石全面围歼中原中共部队的恶毒计划，是发动全面内战的开始；知道蒋介石梦想在四十八小时内歼灭中原李先念将军所部六万余人的梦想，造成所谓“惊人的胜利与奇迹”。蒋介石这个梦想，由于我军胜利突围完全被粉碎了。在缴获的文件中，发现蒋介石的军队把所筑的碉堡以及改装美械后的训练与作战计划，都供给了美军顾问。美国人员明知蒋介石要歼灭我们，可是却假痴假呆的让他们来歼灭我们，这就是美国的所谓“调处”。我们亲眼看到美蒋狼狈为奸的证据，我们亲眼看到蒋介石连自己的军事秘密都全部告诉美国人，我们气得冒起火来了！
    这次我军突围胜利基本的原因，就是我军全体将士都认清了蒋介石背信弃义、卖国殃民的罪恶，认清了美国帝国主义武装干涉中国内政而激起了我军高度的爱国主义与英雄主义的精神。
    蒋介石在围歼失败之后，又增调了第一军、第九十军、第七十六军、第三十六军及四川的第十四军共五个军，企图在鄂鲁陕边将我军歼灭。但是，蒋介石又失败了，我们在和九十军作战中，缴获了蒋介石给赵锡田军的命令。命令里说：要活捉李先念、王震、陈少宠等人，并且要全部歼灭我们的军队；如果不能达成任务，则所有将领都要严重惩罚、军法治罪。蒋介石满以为依靠美帝国主义供给军械和物资以及训练、指挥等援助，加上他那法西斯的军令政令就会打胜仗的。但是，结果怎么样呢？现在追击我们的蒋第十军、第四十一军、第四十七军及第一军，都已经受到惩罚。不过惩罚这些部队的，不是蒋介石，而是解放区自卫战争中的常胜军、我们的刘伯承将军和陈赓将军的部队，把蒋介石嫡系将令赵锡田、黄正成等俘虏，部队消灭了。蒋介石派来追击和堵击我们的部队，被歼灭的、被打伤的、被拖病与开小差的减员，也都在一半以上。
    现在，我军王树声部的皮定均旅，早已经到达苏皖解放区，三五九旅和五师的一部，也已回到陕甘宁边区，其余部队仍在鄂豫皖川陕广大地区与广大人民中生存着。
    三五九旅在两年中间，南下北上跋涉祖国山河达两万二千里，经过八省境地，英勇战胜了日寇、汪精卫和蒋介石，艰苦地克服严寒酷热和江河山岳的自然阻碍，这证明在毛泽东主席与朱德总司令的旗帜下的军队，在反抗外国帝国主义侵略的战争中，在打败卖国贼反动派的战争中，经得起严重的考验，爱国主义与英雄主义的人民的军队，永远是不可战胜！
