　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held a meeting on the 16th, where British representative Ball and American representative Atcheson engaged in a fierce verbal battle. At the meeting, Atcheson, using his authority as chairman, adopted delaying tactics to prevent representatives of the Allied nations from speaking, and instead read a lengthy American statement on the policy of occupying Japan. The statement claimed that Japan had completed its democratic politics after the general election on April 10th, and that Japan's goals were now virtually the same as those of the Allied nations. British representative Ball interrupted Atcheson's reading and retorted: "I must tell you that I cannot agree with the statement regarding the Japanese government." He then revealed the process of the April 10th general election, proving that Japan had not achieved the "democratic politics" as described by Atcheson. Atcheson interrupted Ball's questioning, trying to whitewash the current situation in Japan, saying, "The Yoshida government's current democratic achievements should be given due credit." Ball stood up again and rebuked: "Whenever a representative of any Allied nation criticizes the Japanese government, the American representative always swiftly and enthusiastically defends Japan. Unless more detailed facts can prove that Japan is currently on the path to democracy, there is absolutely no possibility that I will agree with your attitude." After Ball's speech, Soviet representative Derevyanko listed the facts revealed by various Japanese newspapers that the April 10th general election was manipulated by reactionaries, and recounted a series of anti-democratic acts by the Yoshida government, asking Atcheson to explain. Atcheson replied in a flustered manner, "I agree with what the chief of the Government Section of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers declared, that the election was unconditionally successful." Derevyanko further pointed out that there were still many people in the current parliament and at all levels of government who should have been purged according to MacArthur's purge order. Why does MacArthur's headquarters still allow them to hold high positions? Atcheson stared blankly at this question, unable to answer.

　　盟国对日委员会开会
    英美代表激烈舌战
    英方斥美包庇吉田制造伪选
    【新华社延安十八日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会十六日开会，英国代表鲍尔与美国代表艾其森爆发激烈之舌战。艾其森于开会时借主席职权采取拖宕战术，以阻止盟国代表发言，而朗读冗长之美国关于占领日本之政策的声明。声明中称：日本经过四月十日大选已完成民主政治，今天日本与盟国的目的实际上已是一样的了。英代表鲍尔即中断艾其森的朗读，加以反驳道：本席对你表示：对于日本政府的声明不能苟同。并就四月十日大选的经过予以揭发，证明日本并未实现如艾氏所说的“民主政治”。艾其森即打断鲍尔质问，力图粉饰日本目前局势说：“吉田政府目前的民主成就，应给予应得之信誉。”鲍尔又起立斥责道：“任何盟国的代表批评日本政府时，美国代表老是迅速而热心地袒护日本，除非能得更多详细事实，证明日本目前已走上民主，否则我与你的态度绝无苟同之可能。”鲍尔发言后，苏联代表德勒维扬科列举日本各派报纸揭发的四月十日大选为反动派操纵的事实，并缕述吉田政府反民主的一连串事实后，要艾其森解释。艾氏怆惶答道：“我同意盟国最高统帅部政府组主任所宣称选举是无条件成功的。”德勒维扬科又指出目前议会与各级政府中遗有许多按照麦克阿瑟清洗令应被清洗者，为何麦氏总部还容许他们高居职位？艾其森对此质问瞪目无以答。
