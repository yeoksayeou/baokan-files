　　Model Doctor Li Kerang
    Rushing to the Front Lines to Treat the People and Explain Current Events
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 24th dispatch] Li Kerang, a famous model doctor in the Taiyue region, is enthusiastically serving the self-defense war. He frequently rushes to the front lines to treat the participating masses, showing meticulous care for the patients; and promptly explains current events to inspire morale. Therefore, the participating masses in various places are very grateful to this enthusiastic and patriotic doctor. A young man surnamed Wang from Beidou Town in Anze said, "Since he cured my illness, how can I not work a few more days at the front!" On the other hand, Mr. Li also frequently goes to nearby villages to inquire about illnesses. He said, "The men have gone to participate in the war, and if the women at home have an illness, there is no one to take care of them, so I have to go and inquire about illnesses." This makes the men at the front more at ease to serve the war. In the past two months, Mr. Li has treated more than 80 patients.

    奔走前线为群众治病讲解时事
    【本报阳城二十四日电】太岳区著名模范医生李克让热心为自卫战争服务，经常奔走前线，为参战群众治病，对病人体贴无微不至；并及时讲解时事鼓舞斗志。因此各地参战群众对这位热心爱国的医生非常感激。安泽北斗镇一个姓王的青年说：“人家给我治好了病，我能不多在前方工作几天？！”另一方面，李先生又经常到附近村庄去问病，他说：“男人参战去了，女人在家里有个病没人招呼，所以俺要去问病。”这使在前线的男人更放心为战争服务。两个月来经李先生治好的病人共有八十余人。
