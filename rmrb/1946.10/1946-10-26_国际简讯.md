    New Delhi dispatch: Nehru, Chairman of the Indian Interim Government and leader of the Congress Party, was suddenly ambushed by troops of the Ipi indigenous people on the 19th while returning from Rasmak to Miran Shah. Nehru's guards engaged in fierce fighting to protect him. It is reported that although the Muslim League is cooperating with the Congress Party in participating in the interim government, conflicts between Indian and Muslim groups have not abated.

    Reuters, New York, 20th dispatch: According to the New York correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, President Truman's handling of a series of issues has violated the interests and will of the people, causing the proportion of Americans who approve of him to plummet from 87 percent a year ago to 32 percent today.
    TASS, The Hague dispatch: Dutch authorities are attempting to use the ceasefire between the Republic of Indonesia and the British and Dutch to prepare for the continuation of the war. Recently, transport ships full of troops and weapons have been sailing to Java every day.
    Tokyo dispatch: The anti-Yoshida "October Offensive" continues to flourish. The four major transportation industry associations in Osaka went on strike for 24 hours on the 21st, bringing all city traffic to a standstill, forcing the government to accept the employees' demands. The Tokyo Electric Power Workers' Union went on strike on the 19th and 20th evenings, plunging the city into darkness, which also forced the government to accept demands for improved employee conditions. The All-Japan Teachers' Union will also participate in the strike. The union had requested a pay raise from the Ministry of Education but was ultimately rejected. The union immediately convened a struggle committee and issued a declaration warning the government that if it did not accept their demands, it would order teachers across the country to strike.
