　　【Report from our Changzhi Office】 In order to clear their heads and further advance the land reform movement, Party and non-Party cadres in Wu'an County recently studied current affairs, reviewed their leadership, reviewed their work, and examined their thinking at an enlarged cadre meeting held throughout the county.

　　After studying documents such as "Lessons of the Past Year," "The Current Situation and Tasks," and "Emergency Appeal," everyone further clearly recognized that "the United States is a naked imperialist" and "Chiang Kai-shek is a die-hard warlord of civil war" and that "to achieve peace, we must devote all our efforts to winning the patriotic self-defense war." They more clearly recognized that the current war would be long-term and brutal, and everyone made new preparations in their thinking.

　　After this period of study, the comrades' minds were clear. The Wu'an leadership comrades immediately called on everyone to boldly examine the leadership, examine the work, and examine their own thinking after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. They also called on Communist Party members to take the lead. After the comrades present made many criticisms and suggestions to leaders at all levels, they focused on reflecting on their own thinking. Summarizing the problems reflected by the comrades, the main issue was that some people still had some illusions about the US and Chiang Kai-shek, as well as thoughts of peace, enjoyment, and waiting for victory, which became major obstacles to these cadres' further progress. A few comrades abused the fruits of the people's struggle, asked the organization for wives, were not at ease in their work, and even became degenerate and corrupt. After reflection, everyone clearly recognized that this was a slackening of fighting will and a blurring of class consciousness, which endangered the cause of the Party and the people. Especially in the face of Chiang Kai-shek's major offensive, if we do not clean our faces, we cannot achieve "harmony internally and ruthlessness externally."

　　In its summary, the county Party committee first praised comrades with pure consciousness, who worked hard, served the people wholeheartedly, focused on their work, and consistently maintained the glorious style of hard struggle. It gave strict criticism in principle to the very few comrades who violated revolutionary discipline. It reviewed the leadership's failure to understand the situation and educate the comrades in a timely manner, which allowed this thinking to affect our work and cause some of our comrades to be considerably corrupted in the face of this major ideological enemy. However, the county Party committee pointed out that now that we have all taken a bath and removed the dirt, everyone should transform themselves in future work, resolutely oppose hedonism, dispel all illusions about peace, and continue to lead the masses to realize the principle of land to the tiller.

　　After a week of study, the comrades present better mastered Chairman Mao's ideological weapons. Everyone felt very relaxed and happy, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between comrades seemed particularly harmonious and united. (Liu Zhenhua, Hou Xiren, Shi Hong)

　　清醒头脑抛弃任何和平幻想
    武安干部作思想检查
    强化土地改革全力支援自卫前线
    【本报长治讯】为清醒头脑进一步开展土地改革运动，武安全县党与非党干部日前在全县扩干会上学习时事，检查领导、检查工作、检查思想。
    在学习《一年来的教训》、《目前时局与任务》、《紧急号召》等文件后，大家都进一步清楚的认识了“美国是个赤裸裸的帝国主义者”，“蒋介石是个死心塌地的内战魔王”，“要想取得和平，非倾全力取得爱国自卫战争胜利不可。”他们更清楚的认识了目前的战争，将是长期的残酷的，大家都在思想上有了新的准备。
    经过这段学习，同志们头脑清醒了。武安领导同志即号召大家大胆地检查领导、检查工作、检查抗战胜利后自己的思想。并号召共产党员起先锋作用。到会同志向各级领导上提出了不少的批评与意见后，即集中反省自己的思想，综合同志们反省的问题，主要是某些人对美蒋还存在着一些幻想，和太平享乐、等待胜利的思想，成为阻碍这些干部更进步的重大障碍。少数同志滥用老百姓的斗争果实，向组织要老婆，不安心工作，甚至堕落腐化。经过反省，大家明确的认识了这是松懈斗争意志，模糊阶级意识危害党和人民事业的。特别在蒋介石大进攻面前，不把脸洗干净，就无法做到“对内要和，对外要狠。”
    县委在总结时，首先对意识纯正，埋头苦干，全心全意为人民服务，专心工作，一贯保持着艰苦奋斗光荣作风的同志提出表扬，对极少数破坏革命纪律的同志，从原则上给予严格批评。检讨了领导上未能及时了解情况教育同志，使这一思想影响了我们的工作，使我们一部分同志在这一思想大敌面前受了相当的腐蚀。但是，县委指出：现在我们都洗了澡，去掉了脏物，大家应该在今后的工作中，来改造自己，坚决反对享乐主义，驱除一切对和平的幻想，继续领导群众实现耕者有其田。
    经过一周的学习，到会同志更好的掌握了毛主席的思想武器。人人感到很轻松愉快，上下级、同志间显得分外和谐团结了。（刘振华、侯喜仁、史洪）
