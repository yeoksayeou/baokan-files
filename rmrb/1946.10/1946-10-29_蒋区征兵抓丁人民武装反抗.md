Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 26th: People in the Chiang-controlled areas are increasingly resisting conscription, and armed resistance has occurred. Last month, villagers in Gouchang Village, which belongs to Shunzhou Huangping County, were forced to take up arms and launch an armed uprising because the security police team went to the village to indiscriminately grab young men, and finally repelled the security police team. After nine young men in a village in Chengyang District, Jimo Chiang-occupied area of Shandong, were taken away, they all rose up and used wooden sticks to resist the abuse of Kuomintang officers. Some young men in Jimo even mutilated their own bodies to resist conscription. For example, a man surnamed Zhang painfully cut his lower body with a knife, a man surnamed Qiu cut off five fingers, and a young man named Zhao Jiawang chopped off three fingers, but they were still taken away; the movement of young men fleeing is becoming more and more popular. Since conscription in Guizhou Province, young men have fled upon hearing the news, and the rice in the fields awaiting harvesting has fallen and drowned in the water. Since Baotou City, Suiyuan, began conscription on the 27th of last month, it initially conscripted according to household registration, but later, because many people fled, it searched door-to-door, grabbing anyone it encountered. The city gates were once closed, allowing entry but not exit. People hid and refused to come out, and there were no pedestrians on the road. The head of the Baojia in Peiping used the excuse of holding a meeting to grab young men, which was exposed by the people, and everyone adopted the method of not attending the meeting, but still could not catch anyone. Nineteen young men were caught in the Fourth District of Peiping, and seventeen of them ran away on the road. At the same time, due to conscription and requisition of funds, even well-off families openly said, "Being forced to the point of not being able to live, we have no choice but to become Communists!" The original quota for conscription in Tongxian Chengguan District was 180, but soon more than 300 young men fled. A Baozhang in Yangcun near Tianjin committed suicide by jumping into a well because he could not complete the conscription task. The number originally scheduled to be completed on September 1st in Peiping has been postponed three times, and less than half has been completed by October 1st, and some districts have not even completed one-third.

　　蒋区征兵抓丁人民武装反抗
    【新华社延安二十六日电】蒋管区各地人民反对征兵愈演愈烈，并已发生武装反抗事件。上月中，顺州黄平县属狗场村村民因保警队到村乱抓壮丁，被迫拿起武器实行武装起义，卒将保警队击退。山东即墨蒋占区城阳区某村九个壮丁被拉去后，曾全体奋起以木棒抗击国民党军官之虐待。即墨壮丁更有以摧残自己肢体以对抗征兵，如张某忍痛持刀割伤下体，邱某斩去五指，赵家旺一壮丁砍掉三指，但仍被拉去；各地壮丁逃避运动益盛。黔省自征兵以后，青年壮丁闻风而逃，待割之禾谷皆倒溺田中。绥远包头市自上月廿七日开始征兵，初尚依照户口征兵，后以逃避者多，乃挨户搜索，逢人便抓。曾经一度封闭城门许进不许出。人民藏匿不出，路绝行人，北平保甲长利用开会名义、抓丁，被人民戳穿，大家都采取不到会办法，结果还是抓不到人。平市四区抓到十九个壮丁，路上跑掉了十七个。同时由于抓丁征款，迫使小康之家亦公开说“逼得无法活下去，只好做共产党去！”通县城关区原定征丁额一百八十名，但很快即有三百余名壮丁逃跑。天津附近杨村一保长因征兵任务无法完成，投井自杀。北平预定九月一日完成之数目，已延期三次，至十月一日尚未完成一半，有些区尚不及三分之一。
