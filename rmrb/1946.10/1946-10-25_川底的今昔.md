　　The Past and Present of Chuan Di
　　Lin Hua
　　Eight li south of Ping Shun city, nestled at the foot of the mountain west of the river, lies Chuan Di, one of the model villages of Ping Shun. The village is backed by verdant, lush green mountains, the lower slopes of which have been transformed into fertile fields through the great production movement. In front of the village runs the main road to Lin county. In the summer evenings and winter afternoons, small, impromptu markets have formed, which have now transformed from idle chat about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the Eight Immortals into gatherings for sharing stories of labor heroes and organized study. The people are living happy lives with plenty of food and clothing, and are advancing towards the path of greater prosperity. During our visit, while eating and chatting with the cadres and masses, we discovered several thought-provoking things, which I will now briefly describe one by one:

  Cows and Donkeys
　　"Our village used to exchange donkeys for cows, but now it's exchanging cows for donkeys."
　　"I've already exchanged for one donkey, and this winter I'm going to buy another one." This was said to us by Guo Lai-fu, a rich peasant in the village. We were very surprised and asked him about it. He said:
　　"Originally, I had two donkeys, but I exchanged them for cows later." He also said, "In the days of Old Man Yan [Yan Xishan], we had to provide corvée labor for two and a half years out of the year. People didn't have enough to eat, let alone the livestock. If you walked a little slower, you'd get a whip or a rifle butt. I couldn't afford the corvée labor, so I sold the two donkeys and bought cows. After the Eighth Route Army came, the bad guys said they were going to implement communism. I was a rich peasant, so I was very scared. Every day I was waiting for 'communism' and even sold more than twenty mu of land. But after observing things, it wasn't like that at all. Those who were struggled against were people with problems; those without problems weren't struggled against. And the Communist Party's way of doing things is to make everyone's life better. After I understood the situation, in order to enrich my family, I exchanged the cows back for donkeys. Producing when busy and transporting when idle is a real way to get rich! It's not just me. People like Guo Jian-ting in our village used to not have enough to eat from one meal to the next. During the mass movement, he was allocated half a cow, and now he has exchanged it for a donkey. He even wants to partner with Yu-en to buy another one!"

　　After we finished eating, we were about to leave, and he seemed to have many more things to say, but he just excitedly told us, "In the past, our village only had twenty or so livestock, but now we have more than ninety. That works out to one animal per household. By the end of the year, we'll have over a hundred!…"

  Guo Guo-cheng
　　While we were sitting and chatting, the village head came by. A comrade introduced him to us, saying, "He used to be a lazy man, but now he's the village head." From the wrinkles on his face, we could tell that he was a man who had endured much hardship. With a tearful tone, he recalled the past, saying:

　　"Since I was a child, I was a middle peasant, with three mu of land at home. When I was twenty, I started smoking opium, and in less than two years, I had smoked away all my family's property. Every day, I would go to my relatives to grab food, whether they called me or not, I would eat if there was any. All year round, I was barefoot, and my clothes went from small tears to big tears, getting bigger and bigger until I could wear a single garment in any direction. Life forced me to run errands for others. After the incident [likely referring to the Japanese invasion], those guys all ran away, and I returned to the village, but people still looked down on me. After the Eighth Route Army came, the sale of opium was cut off, and I couldn't buy it even if I wanted to. When the addiction flared up, I would complain about the Eighth Route Army. But thinking about it now, if it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, my bones would have been eaten by wolves long ago. The opium addiction was broken, but I still didn't want to move. Comrades! It's not that I didn't want to move, but I didn't have any land to move on! There was no point in moving." He closed his eyes for a moment, calmed himself, and then continued to tell his story:

　　"The people in the village all called me a lazy man. Because I lived in the Temple Hollow, people would say, 'The poorest in our village is Old Guo-cheng in the Temple Hollow,' 'Our village has a big lazy man, living in the Temple Hollow and not moving.' Comrades! Who did I follow to become poor? If it weren't for Yan Xi-shan's official sale of opium, if it weren't for the landlords squeezing us until we couldn't breathe, how could I have become poor?! Do you say it's fate? Why am I not poor now?"

　　He was indignant, indignant at the evil forces and the old society.

　　"That year, our village struggled against the big tyrant landlord Guo Huai-de. I listened to Chairman Mao's words: 'Pull out the roots of poverty and establish the roots of prosperity,' so I actively colluded with people and struggled against him. As a result, I got back three houses and seven mu of land. At this time, I had the energy to move, and I joined the mutual aid team, getting up early and working with people, regardless of wind or rain. I always worked actively. 'Eyes can't see past everyone,' 'The masses are sages.' Last year, I was elected as the village deputy, and this year I was elected as the village head… I can't be poor now. This year, my plan is to cultivate three and save one, and next year I will cultivate two and save one!…"

　　He was happy. The people who have turned themselves over are always happy.

  Seventy Jin a Day
　　Guo Yu-en is a first-class labor hero in the whole county, a sturdy man who looks like a good housekeeper at first glance. He smiled very warmly when he saw me, but his face immediately fell again. He said: "In the past, more than half of the ninety-plus households in our village didn't have enough to eat, especially in the spring and during the New Year, it was a hard time for the poor. In the past, there were more than thirty people who worked as hired laborers outside all year round (out of only seventy laborers in the whole village). After suffering for a whole year, they couldn't even afford a single dumpling for the New Year. Take my father, for example, he lived in other people's houses for more than thirty years. When I could work, I herded sheep and cattle for others. When I grew up, I lived as a long-term laborer for seven or eight years, but I didn't even have a place to stand or a roof over my head. Now it's different, it's a complete reversal. Not only is there no one living as a long-term laborer in the whole village, but there are several families that have become rich peasants and want to hire people. Our village now has various sideline businesses that are booming, including flour mills, vinegar mills, textile factories, and woodworking factories. The technical workers alone need to be paid seventy jin of rice a day. If you include the cattle and sheep workers, it's more than a hundred jin. In the past, people paid our village wages, but now our village pays people wages. We have become the masters."

  "Mom! Which group am I in?"
　　Two little girls, carrying small baskets full of bean pods, with sweat all over their faces, walked past us naturally. One of them is Comrade Chang San-mao's little girl, six years old this year, named Gai-xian (meaning "change the prior"). The other is one year older, named Xiao Si-zi (Little Fourth). Because the adults were all participating in mutual aid teams, Gai-xian pulled on her mother's clothes and said, "Mom! Which group am I in?" Her mother said, "You're still young, you'll join a group when you grow up." When Gai-xian heard that there was no group, she cried and insisted on joining a group. Her mother had no choice but to say, "You and Xiao Si-zi are in a group." She immediately ran to Xiao Si-zi's house and said to her, "My mom said, we're in a group." The two of them formed a group like this. Every day after eating, they would find each other and ask their mothers what work they should do that day. If their mothers said to pick bean pods, the two of them would pick bean pods. If their mothers said to take care of the children, the two of them would take care of the children together.

　　They feel very honored and happy about their group. The adults often say with a smile, "Chairman Mao has even organized the children!"

  "Three Turnarounds"
　　Chuan Di has changed from poverty to prosperity. In the past, more than half of the village didn't have enough to eat, but now the whole village is working towards cultivating three and saving one. Ninety-three households have increased production through organization. Four households have risen from extremely poor peasants to poor peasants, sixty-one households have risen from poor peasants to new middle peasants, twenty-one households have risen from new middle peasants to prosperous middle peasants, and seven households have risen from middle peasants to prosperous middle peasants. An old man said excitedly: "Now it's 'three turnarounds': the crops are growing better year by year – the crops have turned around; the land is being cultivated better year by year – the land has turned around; people's lives are getting better year by year – people have turned around. The world has become a better place."

　　川底的今昔
    林华
    从平顺出城正南八里地，紧靠着河西山脚的一个小村，便是平顺模范村之一的川底。该村背面靠着绿衣丰满的青山，这青山的下半，已在大生产运动中开为可耕的沃田；前面临着通林县的大道，夏晚冬午，习惯的形成了几处小人市，现已一变访三国说八义的闲谈，而为劳动英雄的故事和组织起来的研究场所了。人们都是过着足衣足食的快乐生活，并向富者更富的大道前进。我们一行数人，路过于此，在与干部群众吃饭闲扯中间，发现几件令人回味的事情，兹特逐一略述于次：
  牛和驴
    “我村以前是驴换牛，现在是牛换驴”。
    “现在我已经换了一个驴了，今年冬季还要再买一个。”这是本村一个富农郭来富对我们说的。我们听了很奇怪，就问他，他说：
    “我原先是两个驴，以后把它换成牛了”。他又说：“以前阎老头时，一年就要支两半年差，人都吃不上，牲口就更不用说啦。走的稍微慢一点，就是一皮带，要就是一枪托。我支不起差，就把两驴卖了，买成牛。八路军来了以后，坏人说是要共产哩，我是富农，很害怕，每天是等着“共产”哩，把地也卖了二十多亩。可是以后看了看，不是那么回事，凡是斗争的，都是有问题的人，没有问题的不斗争。并且共产党这套办法，就是叫人人好过哩。我看清了世道后，为了发我的家，就把牛又换成驴了。忙时生产，闲时运输，真是个发财事情！这也不光是我一个人，像我村的郭建亭，过去是吃了上顿没下顿，群众运动时，他分了半个牛，现在已换成一个驴了，他还想和玉恩再伙买一个哩！”
    吃罢饭我们要走了，他好像还有许多话要说似的，但只很兴奋的告诉了我们一句：“过去我村才有二十几个牲口，眼下已有了九十多头了，算来一户合一个牲口，到年底要喂到一百多头哩。…………”
  郭国成
    我们闲坐时，村长从旁过来了，一个工作同志就向我们介绍说：他过去是懒汉，现在成了本村的村长啦。我们从他满面皱纹的脸上，看出他是一个饱受风霜的人。他带着鼻酸的心情，回忆着过去，他说：
    “从小我是个中农，家里三亩地，二十岁上那年吃上了大烟，不到二年就把家业抽光了。每天是在本家去抓饭吃，不管他叫不叫，成了就要吃。整年是光着脚，衣服是小缝变大缝，越破越大，末了是一件衣服横竖都能穿上。生活逼的没办法，就去给人跑闲腿。事变后，那些家伙都跑了，我又回到村上，人们还是看不起。八路军来了以后，卖烟土的也断了，这时想吃也买不上，瘾发了时就埋怨八路军。可是，这会儿想想，要不是八路军，我的骨头也早叫狼吃了。烟瘾断啦，可是还不想动。同志呀！不是不想动，咱没有了土地去那动？动着也没劲。”他闭了会眼睛，镇静了一回，又述说着他的往事：
    “村上的人们都叫我懒汉，因我在庙凹住，人们都说“咱村数谁穷，庙凹老国成”，“咱村有个大懒汉，住在庙凹不动弹”。同志呀！我是跟上谁穷了呢？要不是阎锡山官卖大烟土，要不是财主压的咱喘不上气，我怎么还会穷了呢！！你说怨命吗？我这回怎么不穷了呢？”
    他愤恨了，愤恨着恶势力和旧社会。
    “那年我村斗争大恶霸地主郭怀德，我听了毛主席的话：“拔了穷根按富根”，就积极串通人和他斗，结果我要回三间房子七亩地。这时动着也有了心劲啦，又参加了互助组，起早搭黑的和人们在一块干，也不管刮风下雨，对工作我总是积极的干。“眼不过大家”，“众人是圣人”，去年选我当村副，今年又选我当村长……。这可穷不了啦，今年我的计划是耕三余一，明年我就要耕二余一哩…………”
    他愉快了，翻了身的人们总是快乐的。
  一天开支七十斤
    郭玉恩是全县的头等劳动英雄，粗壮的个子，一见就是个好受家。他见了我很热情的笑了，但马上脸又沉下来。他说：“过去我村九十多户，就有一多半没吃喝的，尤其是春天和过年，更是穷人难过的时候。以前，整年在外边当雇工的就有三十多个（全村才七十个劳力）。整受一年，到过年时，连一顿饺子也吃不上。就说我父亲吧，给人家住了三十多年。我会动时就给人家放羊放牛，大了住主（即当长工），住了七八年，可是连个脚踏的，头顶的都没有。现在可不一样了，简直是大大翻个，全村不光是没个住主的，光变成富农要雇人的就有好几家，我村现在各种副业都很起劲，开有粉坊、醋坊、纺织厂、木工厂。每天光技术工人要开支工资米七十斤，要是连牛羊工一块算，就得一百多斤了。过去是人给我村工资，现在是我村给人工资了，我们当了东家了。”
  “娘！我跟谁在一组？”
    两个小姑娘，提着满小篮豆荚，流着一脸汗，在我们面前，自自然然的走过去了。她是常三毛同志的小女孩，今年六岁了，名叫改先。那一个长她一岁，名叫小四子。因大人都参加了互助组，改先就拉着她娘的衣襟说：“娘！我在那一组呀？”娘说：“你还小哩，长大了参加组。”改先听说没有组，就哭着闹着，非得参加个组不行。娘没办法了就说：“你和小四子一组。”她就马上跑到小四子家和她说：“俺娘说哩，咱俩是一组。”他两个就这样结成了一组。每天吃完饭，就找到一块，去问她娘，今天干啥活，娘说摘豆荚吧，两个人就摘豆荚，娘说看孩子，两个人就共同看孩子。
    对于她们两个人的这个组，觉的非常光荣和幸福，大人们常笑着说：“毛主席连小孩子也给组织起来了！”
  “三翻身”
    川底已变穷困为富裕了。过去全村没吃的户，就占半数以上，现在全村已作到耕三余一，经组织起来生产上升的有九十三户。赤贫升贫农的四户，贫农升新中农的六十一户，新中农升富裕中农的二十一户，中农升富裕中农的七户。一个老汉很兴奋的说：“现在是‘三翻身’：庄稼一年比一年长的好——庄稼翻身；地一年比一年作造的好——地翻身；人的时光一年比一年过的好——人翻身。世道就是变好了。”
