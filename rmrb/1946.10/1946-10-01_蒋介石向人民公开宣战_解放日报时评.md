    Chiang Kai-shek Publicly Declares War on the People
    Liberation Daily Commentary
    On the 23rd, Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech in Nanchang, calling for the "promotion and magnification" of the "historical glory" of his "bandit suppression" in Jiangxi ten years ago. Since the Xi'an Incident, this is the first time, in Chiang Kai-shek's own public statements, that he has re-proposed the call for "bandit suppression." This indicates that Chiang Kai-shek has torn off all his masks and openly declared war on the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas and the people of the whole country. At the same time, it also shows that Chiang Kai-shek, fearing the powerful force of the people, has to resort to self-deceiving "reminiscences" and "spiritual strength" to embolden himself and his henchmen. As early as during the civil war, he declared, "If China is conquered by imperialism, we can still be slaves of a conquered nation and survive. But if it is conquered by the Communists, we would rather not be slaves." "The greatest calamity of the country lies not in the Japanese pirates but in the bandits in Jiangxi." This fully reveals his traitorous slave mentality of "preferring to give to foreign friends rather than to domestic slaves." Chiang Kai-shek's blatant speech this time is another demonstration of his determination to betray the country, to be dictatorial, and to wage a full-scale and long-term civil war to achieve his betrayal of the country and dictatorship. Everything like the "Five-Man Committee," "reorganization of the government," and "convening the National Assembly as scheduled on November 12" has been proven by Chiang Kai-shek's speech to be insidious and meaningless traps. The history of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and dictatorship over the past nineteen years proves that the true essence of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "revival and the nation" is "national subjugation and extermination." Only because of the heroic struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek's "national subjugation and extermination" line could not be implemented, and the common enemy of the Chinese nation—Japanese imperialism—was defeated. Now Chiang Kai-shek has completely copied the set of "September 18th" Incident. But he has forgotten that the Chinese people, who have awakened unprecedentedly and united as a result of the eight-year War of Resistance, will never be fooled by Chiang Kai-shek. They have sufficient power to crush the reactionaries' offensive and resolutely strive for an independent, free, peaceful, and democratic New China, which will quickly turn Chiang Kai-shek's most comforting memories into a sad dream. (September 28th)
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to the Central News Agency, Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech at a welcome meeting in Nanchang on the 23rd, openly raising the slogan of "wiping out bandits." He said that Jiangxi was able to "pacify the bandits" from the 20th to the 23rd year of the Republic because "there was a spiritual force," namely "the implementation of the New Life Movement." Chiang Kai-shek called for "promoting and magnifying" this "historical glory" and "working hard together, as in the past." According to Chiang Kai-shek's public call for "bandit suppression," that is, waging an anti-national, anti-democratic, and anti-people civil war, this is the first time since the War of Resistance. Two months ago, on July 24, Chiang Kai-shek, in his address to the Lushan Summer Camp, the first sentence was that Lushan was a "base" for "bandit suppression." The Kuomintang authorities had prohibited reporters from publishing this passage, but it was revealed by a weekly published in Shanghai on August 28.

　　蒋介石向人民公开宣战
    解放日报时评
    蒋介石二十三日在南昌发表演说，号召“发扬光大”其十年前江西“剿匪”“历史的光荣”。西安事变以来，重新提出“剿匪”的号召，就蒋介石本人的公开发言来说，这还是第一次，这表示蒋介石已撕破一切假面具，公开向解放区军民和全国人民宣战，同时也表示蒋介石因为害怕人民的强大力量，不得不乞灵于自欺欺人的“回忆”和“精神的力量”，来壮自己命令和他的喽罗们的胆。早在内战时期，他就宣布“中国亡于帝国主义，我们还可能当亡国奴，尚可苟延残喘，若亡于共产党，则宁肯为奴隶亦不可得。”“国家的大患不在倭寇而在江西的土匪。”这已充分显出他一付“宁赠友邦勿与家奴”的卖国奴才相。蒋介石这次露骨的演说，就是再一次表明他决心卖国、决心独裁、决心全面和长期打内战来达成他的卖国和独裁，一切什么“五人委员会”、“改组政府”、“十一月十二日如期召开国民大会”之类，都由蒋介石的演说证明为阴险无聊的圈套。过去十九年蒋介石卖国独裁的历史，证明蒋介石所谓“复兴与民族”，其真缔就是“亡国灭种”，仅仅因为中国共党和中国人民的英勇奋斗，才使蒋介石的“亡国灭种”路线无法贯彻，才击败了中华民族的世仇——日本帝国主义。现在蒋介石又把“九一八”那时候的一套全盘搬出来了。但是他忘记了，经过八年抗战的已经觉醒了的中国人民空前的觉醒和团结，他们绝不会上蒋介石的当，他们已有足够强大的力量粉碎反动派的进攻，来坚决争取独立自由和平民主的新中国，这将使蒋介石最足自慰的回忆很快变成一场悲哀的梦。（九月廿八日）
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据中央社讯：二十三日蒋介石在南昌各界欢迎会上发表训词，公开提出“扑灭匪祸”的口号。他说：民国二十到二十三年江西所以能够“敉平匪乱”，是因为“有一个精神的力量”，即“实行新生活运动”。蒋介石号召“发扬光大”这种“历史的光荣”，“如同过去一样，共同一致埋头苦干”。按蒋介石公开提出“剿匪”亦即进行反民族反民主反人民的内战之口号，自抗战以来，这还是第一次。两个月以前，七月二十四日，蒋介石在对庐山夏令营致训词，第一句话就是庐山是“剿匪”的“根据地”，这段话，国民党当局曾经禁止记者发表，但为八月二十八日上海出版的周报所揭露。
