　　Following the anti-traitor liquidation movement, industrial production among Jiaozuo citizens has gradually begun to develop. As of the 14th of last month, residents of six streets, including Shengli North Street and Xinhua North Street, have voluntarily pooled shares to establish six textile factories, and are now actively preparing to start operations. In addition, five textile factories (three are joint public-private ventures, one is privately owned, and one is publicly owned) have already started operations. Residents of Minsheng East Street and Shengchan Street have opened two oil mills. Residents of Laodong Street and two other streets have opened three flour mills. Several other streets have established two grinding mills, three mountain goods stores, and one medicinal materials store. Preparations are also underway to open two leather factories, two small iron factories, and one cigarette factory. The textile movement is widely underway in citizens' homes. According to statistics from seventeen streets, 1,223 women have joined textile groups. They own 1,132 spinning wheels and 30 looms. At a gathering of over 200 citizen cadres and activists in mid-September, it was further decided to systematically transform consumer cooperatives into producer cooperatives, and to mobilize capital from foreign goods stores and silversmith shops into the industrial sector. Government loans of 3.7 million yuan in September to support industry and commerce further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm.
