They gin an average of 450 jin of cotton per day, with a wage of 5 yuan per jin; the cotton fluffer fluffs 40 jin of cotton per day, with a wage of 30 yuan per jin. In the past half month, they have earned 51,700 yuan in silver dollars. It has also solved the problems of cotton ginning and fluffing for the masses and helped with women's spinning. Therefore, the masses and team members are very satisfied. Under the influence of this team, Wang Wensheng's mutual aid team organized a grinding team, and Wang Tianwen's mutual aid team organized a cart team. All kinds of winter production are being planned and organized. Now that the autumn harvest and autumn planting have ended, a vigorous winter production campaign is about to begin in the whole village.
