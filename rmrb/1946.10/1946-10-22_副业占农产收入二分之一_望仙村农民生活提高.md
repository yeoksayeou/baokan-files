　　Sideline Occupations Account for Half of Agricultural Income
    Living Standards of Wangxian Village Farmers Improve
    [From our newspaper, Yangcheng, 19th] The income from sideline production in Wangxian Village, Yuanqu County, accounts for one-half of agricultural production, and the living standards of the masses are gradually improving. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the village was devastated by the Japanese invaders, with all houses destroyed and livestock taken away, causing great hardship to the masses. Since the reduction of rent and interest last winter, the masses' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, especially for sideline production. According to September statistics, the village has a total of 778 pigs, including 51 sows, averaging two to three pigs per household. Zhang Xiyan, a labor hero who turned over a new leaf, alone raises 16 pigs. The village cooperative also took advantage of the slack farming season to organize the masses to cut more than 2,000 timber logs in the mountains, earning 900,000 yuan. Profits from sideline production account for one-half of agricultural income, and the living standards of the masses are improving day by day. The village cooperative slaughters a pig every three or four days, and the masses who eat meat have greatly increased.

　　副业占农产收入二分之一
    望仙村农民生活提高
    【本报阳城十九日电】垣曲望仙村副业生产收入占农业生产二分之一，群众生活水平日渐提高。该村在抗日战争中，曾惨遭日寇浩劫、房屋毁尽，牲口不留，群众备受艰苦。去冬减租减息后，群众生产情绪顿形高涨，特别是对副业生产。据九月统计全村共养猪七百七十八口，其中有母猪五十一口，平均每户养猪两口到三口。翻身的劳动英雄张希彦一家即养十六口。村合作社更利用农闲组织群众上山砍伐木料二千余条，赚九十万元。副业生产盈利占农业收入的二分之一，群众的生活水平日益提高。三四天内村合作社就杀猪一口，肉食群众大大增加。
