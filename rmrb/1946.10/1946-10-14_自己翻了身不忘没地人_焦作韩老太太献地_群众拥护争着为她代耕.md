　　Having Turned Over, She Doesn't Forget Those Without Land
    Jiao Zuo Old Lady Han Donates Land
    The Masses Support Her, Eagerly Offering to Farm for Her
    [Our Newspaper Jiao Zuo News] Old Lady Han Menghua from Jiao Zuo Street in the urban district, used to have twenty-six mu of land, all of which were forcibly bought by traitors and despots. The old lady's grievances piled up like mountains, and she lived by begging. When our army liberated Jiao Zuo, relief grain saved her life, and she was also given a loan to weave. This spring, when the despots were struggled against, all of her land was returned to her. Recently, seeing that many people still had no land to cultivate, she voluntarily donated eighteen mu of land to those without land. The masses unanimously praised her and actively signed up to farm for the old lady. Several people immediately went out to help the old lady plow the dry land. Old Lady Han said to everyone with a smile: "We are truly one family! I have lived for over fifty years, and I have never seen such a good world as today! I never dreamed that I would get back my twenty-six mu of land, and that people would help me farm it!" Now the old lady and the masses get along like one family, loving each other. Her complexion is also much younger than before.

　　自己翻了身不忘没地人
    焦作韩老太太献地
    群众拥护争着为她代耕
    【本报焦作讯】市内区焦作街韩孟化老太太，过去有二十六亩地，都被汉奸恶霸强迫买走了，老人家冤积如山，求乞渡日。我军解放焦作时，救济粮救活了她，又贷款让她纺织。今春斗争恶霸时，全部土地也拿回来了。最近她看到许多群众还没地种，便自动献出十八亩地给没地的人。群众一致称赞，纷纷自动报名替老太太种地。有好几个人马上就出动去帮老太太犁旱地。韩老太太笑对大家说：“真是一家人啦！我活了五十多岁，就没见过如今这么好的世道！我以前梦也梦不到会把二十六亩地拿回来，还有人能帮我种！”现在老太太和群众像一家人一样相亲相爱的相处着。脸色也像比以前年青了好多。
