　　【Benbao Ji Lu Yu 26 Ri Dian】The Qingfeng Gaoling stretcher team promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, helping the local people with production and labor, and solving difficulties, which won the support of the local people. Zhao Changtong, the leader of the third squad of the Qingfeng Fifth Detachment, was the director of the village trade union at home. He led seven people to cut soybeans on 15 mu of land for the landlord. Wang Hailu and Wang Suocheng, the leaders of the fifth squad, helped the villagers build houses and do carpentry work. Squads four, five, and six helped cut sorghum. Cui Zhankui led 15 people to cut soybeans for an old lady, and the local people were very grateful to them. At the same time, the stretcher team of the Third District of Gaoling County also improved its relationship with the local people. They helped the masses with work, treated the masses' cattle, mended broken pots, and repaired farm tools. Two poor old widows went to the headquarters of the company to find someone to help them with work, and the company headquarters immediately mobilized twelve people to do the work for both families. In this way, the stretcher team and the local people became one, and the relationship was extremely close. The masses said: "Such a stretcher team is really good! They carry the wounded and help the people. The people in the Liberated Areas are truly one family!"

    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】清丰高陵担架队发扬互助友爱精神，帮助驻地群众生产劳动，解决困难，深得当地人民拥护。清丰五分队三班长赵氅同在家是村工会主任，他带领七人给房东割豆子十五亩，五班长王海禄、王锁成二人帮助驻村群众盖屋，做木匠活，四、五、六班帮砍高粱，崔占魁带领十五人给一个老太太割豆子，当地群众对他们非常感激。与此同时，高陵县三区担架队也改善了与驻地群众的关系。他们帮助群众做活，给群众的耕牛看病，补破锅、修理农具。有两个贫苦老寡妇到中队部找人帮她们做活，中队部马上动员了十二个人把两家的活都做了。这样，担架队与驻地群众打成一片，关系极为密切。群众说：“这样的担架队真好呀！又抬伤兵又帮助老百姓。解放区老百姓真是一家人！”
