　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Chongqing report: The legal community here is rising up in protest against the atrocity of the US military truck that ran over and killed lawyer Wang Zhenhua in Beiping. Lawyer Tao Weineng said: "The reason why the US military is so unscrupulous in China is truly a national disgrace. The key to fundamentally solving this problem is national independence." Lawyer Su Minying said: "Legally speaking, if a country's military vehicle kills someone in another country, it should first be disarmed, and then dealt with in accordance with the laws of that country. If we want to fundamentally solve such incidents, then the US military should withdraw from China as soon as possible." Lawyer Cui Guohan said in a painful tone: "My opinion is only two words - indignation." Lawyer Zhang Ru advocated opening a military court to try the offending US soldiers according to law. In addition to expressing his protest, lawyer Li Lichuan also demanded compensation for losses from the United States. It is heard that the Chongqing Lawyers Association will hold a board of directors meeting in the near future to express its views.

　　重庆律师界义愤填膺
    抗议美军卡车暴行
    主张美军早日退出中国，依法审判肇事美兵
    【新华社延安十八日电】渝讯：此间律师界纷起抗议北平美军卡车辗死律师王振华的暴行。陶惟能律师称：“美军在华之所以肆无忌惮，实在是国家的耻辱，根本解决这问题的关键，还是国家独立的问题。”苏岷英律师称：“从法律上讲，如果一个国家的军车在别国国内撞死了人，首先应该解除武装，其次应依照该国的法律处置。如果要从根本上解决这类事件，那么美军最好是早日退出中国。”崔国翰律师以痛心语气说：“我的意见只有两个字——义愤。”张儒律师主张开军事法庭，依法审判肇事美兵。李丽川律师除表示抗议外，并要求美国赔偿损失。闻重庆律同业公会不日将举行理监事会有所表示。
