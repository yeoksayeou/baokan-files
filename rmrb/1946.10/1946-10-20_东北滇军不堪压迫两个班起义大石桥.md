Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 17th. Stone Zhenshan, platoon leader, and Zhang Guobiao, deputy platoon leader, of the 5th Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment, 20th Division, 93rd Army of the Yunnan Army stationed in Dashiqiao (southwest of Haicheng), led two platoons of soldiers in a mutiny. On September 14th, they safely arrived at the station of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army. They said to the commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Army: "We have finally found you. Chiang Kai-shek wants our Yunnan Army and the Democratic Allied Army to perish together. He never expected that today we would shake hands on the front line." According to the mutinying officers and soldiers, Chiang Kai-shek's divisive rule over the Yunnan Army is becoming increasingly fierce. Since the company was replaced by Company Commander Du, a graduate of the Central Military Academy, everything has become even darker. The brothers only receive 260 yuan of their monthly salary of 500 yuan, and they cannot even afford shoes. Recently, they have not been paid for three consecutive months. Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Guobiao requested to settle the accounts, and Company Commander Du held a grudge in his heart. Every time they drilled, he would always find fault with Zhang Guobiao in front of everyone, saying that he should "be careful with your head." Therefore, everyone believed that only by going to the Democratic Allied Army could they escape from the sea of suffering. On August 29th, they left their station and headed for the Democratic Allied Army. They were pursued by Chiang's army along the way, endured hunger and suffering, marched at night and hid during the day. After two months, they broke through Chiang's army's encirclement twice. Unfortunately, five brothers were lost, but they finally arrived at a certain place and joined the Democratic Allied Army.

　　东北滇军不堪压迫两个班起义大石桥
    【新华社东北十七日电】驻大石桥（海城西南）之云南军队九十三军二十师三团二营五连一班长石振山、排副张国标率领两班弟兄起义，已于九月十四日安抵民主联军某部驻地，他们对民主联军的指战员说：“我们终于找到了你们，蒋介石想我们云南军队和民主联军一同消灭，他没想到今天我们在火线上握起手来了”。据起义之官兵称：蒋介石对滇军的分化统治，愈来愈凶，该连自换上中央军校出身的杜连长，一切更加黑暗，弟兄们每月五百元的饷，只发二百六十元，连鞋子都穿不上，最近一连三个月没发饷。排副张国标要求算账，杜连长含恨在心，每次出操总在大家面前找张国标的毛病，说是要“小心你的脑袋”，因此大家认为只有到民主联军去，才能逃出苦海，乃于八月二十九日离开驻地，奔赴民主联军沿途遭受蒋军之追击，挨饥受苦，夜走昼伏，时经两月，曾两次突破蒋军包围，不幸失散了五个兄弟，但终于抵达某地与民主联军会合。
