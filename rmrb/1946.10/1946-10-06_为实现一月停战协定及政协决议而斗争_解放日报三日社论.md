*Liberation Daily* Editorial, October 3rd

　　Beginning September 29th, Chiang Kai-shek has already started attacking Zhangjiakou.

　　On August 5th, Chiang Kai-shek put forward so-called five conditions, saying that the Communist Party must agree to these five conditions before he would agree to a ceasefire. These five conditions were: (1) to cede the Su-Wan area; (2) to cede the Jiaoji Railway line; (3) to cede Chengde and the area south of Chengde; (4) to retreat to Heilongjiang, Xing'an, Nenjiang and Yanji in the Northeast before October 15th; (5) to withdraw from the areas liberated from the puppet troops after June 7th in Shandong and Shanxi provinces. Chiang Kai-shek himself stood up in favor of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and he himself solemnly signed the truce order on January 10th. These agreements have now been completely destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek himself. We pointed out long ago that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called five conditions were synonymous with an unlimited, all-out civil war, the purpose of which was to "thoroughly eliminate the Communist Party" in order to eliminate all democratic forces in China. Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen and American reactionaries attempted to deceive the Chinese and foreign people, saying that Chiang Kai-shek did not seem to want an all-out civil war, but only "five strategic areas." Now, look, Zhangjiakou is not included in these so-called five conditions, but why doesn't Chiang Kai-shek attack it? Chiang Kai-shek's conditions were not those "five" at all, but only one, which was to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese democratic forces. Chiang Kai-shek's content of "restoring transportation," economic construction," etc., turned out to be the three words "fight a civil war." The so-called "mediation" by the American government was nothing but to gain time to help and cover up its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in establishing a dictatorial rule in the country, turning China into a colony of the United States.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's re-launching of the all-out civil war has been going on for three months now, counting from July. When he launched the civil war, we pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek had fatal difficulties such as the army's aversion to war, the people's opposition, the economic crisis, and insufficient troop strength, and pointed out his inevitable failure. Chiang Kai-shek has these fatal weaknesses, and no matter how much the American government helps, it cannot save his fate! The development of the war situation in the past three months is just as we predicted. Chiang Kai-shek's situation is getting worse and worse. Now even the United Press International's Peiping dispatch on the 27th has to say that the progress of the Chiang army "has slowed down."

　　In the past three months, the regular troops of Chiang Kai-shek whose entire brigades (divisions) have been annihilated or suffered devastating blows (i.e., more than half annihilated) have reached more than twenty-five. If we include the large number of puppet troops, security teams, and traffic police that have been annihilated by us, the number far exceeds this. Chiang Kai-shek has taken the garrison troops in Wuhan, the garrison in Qiongyai, the puppet troops just sent to Taiwan, the garrison originally scheduled to be sent to Japan, and the troops originally scheduled to guard Ninghu to the front line. The situation of insufficient troops has been completely exposed. Chiang Kai-shek has no reserves. All his troops have gone to the front line. However, Chiang Kai-shek is still unable to make up for his losses. Chiang Kai-shek occupied some cities at great sacrifice, and the transportation lines were extended, and the troop strength was greatly dispersed. Both insufficient and dispersed, this is the fundamental reason for Chiang Kai-shek's inevitable military failure. Even the Americans are now beginning to admit this situation.

　　Among the twenty-five brigades of Chiang Kai-shek that were annihilated, Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage accounted for the majority, and the miscellaneous troops accounted for only a part. Chiang Kai-shek's most direct lineage fought the worst in the battle. Zhao Xitian, the division commander of the Third Division, and Huang Zhengcheng, the brigade commander of the First Brigade, were all captured on the battlefield. This not only shows the incompetence of Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage, and that the so-called American weapons did not increase their combat effectiveness, but also shows that the miscellaneous troops are becoming less and less active in combat, and only a few die-hard running dogs like Fu Zuoyi are temporarily exceptions.

　　Equally bad for Chiang Kai-shek are the battles like those in the Central Plains and Rehe and eastern Hebei. Chiang Kai-shek surrounded our Central Plains troops with ten divisions (armies), as if with an iron barrel. However, this "iron barrel" turned out to be bottomless! In early July, all our Central Plains troops broke through safely with very little loss. Chiang Kai-shek attacked the local troops in Rehe and eastern Hebei with eight divisions (armies). After attacking until now, he occupied some county towns, but the Chiang army suffered no losses. Recently, they have turned to counter-offensive, annihilating the Chiang army one by one. Chiang Kai-shek occupied many towns in central Jiangsu, thinking that he was so proud and delusional. However, in the two-month counterattack, the troops under our General Su Yu annihilated more than 60,000 Chiang troops, which is about twice the number of our troops in the area. There are many other examples, which need not be listed one by one.

　　The Chiang army is like this, what about our army?

　　It should be admitted that because we over-believed in the truce agreement in the past, we were not prepared enough in some areas when Chiang Kai-shek launched an all-out civil war on the 7th, which increased some troubles. But after fighting for a month, morale has become higher, the replenishment of soldiers has also increased, the people have been tempered, and the combat methods have also improved. Even the corps that had weaker combat effectiveness in the past have been strengthened in combat, so there are more and more victories. Our liberated areas are so vast, and the land problem has been solved. Chiang Kai-shek has no way to occupy it no matter what. Our task is to eliminate the enemy's effective strength. When the time is right, we will turn to a full-scale counter-offensive and recover all the lost land. The better our corps fight, the faster this time will come.

　　When the enemy's effective strength is eliminated to a certain extent, Chiang Kai-shek's tragic end will be inevitable. Because of the army's aversion to war, a new General Gao Shuxun will appear. Because the rear is empty, the people oppose it, and there is an economic crisis, Chiang Kai-shek's rear will be unstable. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek will be unable to take care of himself. Under the attack of our People's Liberation Army, he will never be able to maintain the cities in the liberated areas that he occupies for a long time.

　　This is why we do not stubbornly defend a city or a place when the situation is unfavorable (we will never give up the places that can be defended), but focus on annihilating the enemy's effective strength. This is why we still have difficulties and hard struggles in front of us, but our confidence in victory is increasing day by day.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's decline has been revealed. Wherever the Chiang army goes, it is already and will become the graveyard of the Chiang army. Chiang Kai-shek's risky attack on Zhangjiakou or any other place will only accelerate his failure. Firmly grasp the principle of annihilating the enemy's effective strength, and grasp the principle of annihilation warfare. We will surely win, and the Chinese people and democratic forces will surely win. There is no doubt about it. The iron rule of history stipulates that reactionaries will inevitably fail. Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries cannot escape this. Only then will the Chinese people and democrats be able to force Chiang Kai-shek to implement the January truce agreement and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions this year. Before more of Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops are annihilated and he is forced to implement the January truce agreement and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, Chiang Kai-shek will never relax his efforts to eliminate the Communist Party and democratic forces, and neither will Chiang Kai-shek's American collaborators. The American and Chiang bandits collude with each other and will inevitably try their best to eliminate the Communist Party and democratic forces, including military offensives and the use of all kinds of conspiracies and tricks, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals.

　　Because the signs of defeat of the Chiang army have been revealed, Chiang Kai-shek and his American collaborators are now beginning to play new tricks in an attempt to deceive the people. This trick is to release the air of "truce." The purpose of this trick by the American and Chiang bandits is obviously to maintain the land they have occupied in the civil war, so as to gain another opportunity to replenish their troops. Chiang Kai-shek is setting up many division-level military districts across the country and restoring the conscription system. He is delusional to maintain the areas he has occupied and, after occupying Zhangjiakou and other places, gain time to replenish new recruits to facilitate further battles. The reactionary plan of the American and Chiang bandits is like this: fight for a while, talk for a while, then fight for a while and talk for a while, then fight... until the Communist Party and democratic forces are completely eliminated. Fortunately, these kinds of conspiracies by the American and Chiang bandits can no longer deceive anyone. The Chinese people urgently need peace, and the Communist Party is unwilling to fight for a day. But deception cannot create peace. The American and Chiang bandits will not give up their conspiracy to eliminate the CCP and democratic forces for a day, and the invading troops will not withdraw from the occupied areas for a day. The implementation of the January truce agreement and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions is not guaranteed for a day, and the self-defense war of the Chinese People's Liberation Army cannot be stopped for a day. Restoring the boundaries and troop deployments of both sides when the January 13th truce order took effect and implementing all the Political Consultative Conference resolutions are the sacred rights of the Chinese people. If Chiang Kai-shek really wants peace, he should first automatically restore the sacred position of the January truce agreement.

　　为实现一月停战协定及政协决议而斗争
    解放日报三日社论
    九月二十九日起，蒋介石业已开始进攻张家口。
    蒋介石于八月五日曾提出所谓五个条件，说中共方面要答应这五个条件，他才答应停战。这五个条件是：（一）让出苏皖区；（二）让出胶济线；（三）让出承德及承德以南地区；（四）东北在十月十五日以前退至黑龙江、兴安、嫩江与延吉；（五）山东、山西两省退出六月七日后从伪军手中解放的地区。蒋介石自己对政治协商会议决议起立赞成，他自己在一月十日的停战令上庄严的签了字，这些协议至此全部被蒋介石亲手破坏无遗了。我们当时老早就指出，蒋介石的所谓五个条件，就是无限制的全面内战的代名词，其目的在于所谓“彻底消灭共产党”，以便消灭全中国一切民主力量。蒋介石的喽罗们和美国反动派则企图蒙混中外人民的耳目，说蒋介石似乎并不要全面内战，只要“五个战略区域”而已。现在大家看吧，张家口并不包含在这所谓五个条件之内，蒋介石又何尝不去进攻？蒋介石的条件，原来不是那什么“五个”，而是只有一个，就想消灭中国共产党和中国民主力量。蒋介石的什么“恢复交通”、经济建设等等的内容，原来就是“打内战”三个字。美国政府的所谓“调解”，原来不是别的，就是取得时间帮助和掩护其走狗蒋介石在全国建立独裁统治，把中国变为美国的殖民地。
    蒋介石重新发动全面内战，从七月算起到现在已经三个月了。当他发动内战之初，我们即指出蒋介石有军心厌战、民心反对、经济危机及兵力不足等项致命的困难，指出了他的必然失败。蒋介石有了这几个致命的弱点，不管美国政府怎样帮助也无法挽救其命运！三个月来战局的发展正如我们所预见，蒋介石的情况愈来愈糟了，现在连美国的合众社北平廿七日电，也不得不说蒋军“其进度已减低”了。
    三个月来，蒋介石的正规军，整个旅（师）被歼灭的或者受到歼灭性打击的（即一半以上被歼灭）已达二十五个之多。如果连伪军、保安队、交通警察等大量被我歼灭者一概计算在内，则远超出此地。蒋介石已把武汉的守备军队、琼崖的驻军、刚才派到台湾的伪军、原定派到日本的驻军、原定守备宁沪的军队都拿到前线上，兵力不足的势态，已经完全暴露。蒋介石是没有后备的了，他所有几个兵都到了前线上。然而，蒋介石仍然无法弥补其损失，蒋介石以很大的牺牲占领了一些城市，交通线延长了，兵力就大大的分散了。既不足又分散，这就是蒋介石军事上必然失败的根本原因。此种情况，现在连美国人也开始承认了。
    在蒋介石被消灭的二十五个旅之中，蒋介石的嫡系占了大多数，杂牌军只占一部分。蒋介石的最嫡系在作战中打得顶糟糕，第三师师长赵锡田、第一旅旅长黄正成，都做了战场的俘虏，这不但说明蒋介石嫡系的低能，所谓美国武器也没有增加他们的战斗力，而且说明杂牌军的作战越来越不积极了，只有几条死走狗如傅作义之流，暂时还是例外。
    对于蒋介石同样糟糕的，是象中原和热河、冀东那样的战例。蒋介石以十个师（军）包围我中原军，包围得铁桶相似，然而这个“铁桶”竟是没底的！七月初，我中原军全部安全突围，损失甚小。蒋介石以八个师（军）进攻热河、冀东的地方部队，攻到现在，占了一些县城，但蒋军毫无损失，最近已转入反攻，逐一歼灭蒋军。蒋介石占了苏中许多城镇，自以为得意妄至，可是我粟裕将军所部，在两个月的反击中，即消灭蒋军六万余，其数量约等于该地我军之两倍。别的例子还很多，不必一一列举了。
    蒋军方面如此，我军方面怎样呢？
    应该承认，由于我们过去过分相信了停战协定，在七日间蒋介石发动全面内战时，我们有些地区准备不够，因而增加了若干麻烦。但是打了一个月，士气更加高涨了，兵员补充也增多了，人民有了锻炼，作战方法亦有进步，连过去战斗力较弱的兵团，也因在作战中加强了，因而胜仗就越打越多。我们解放区如此广大，而且解决了土地问题，蒋介石无论如何也没有办法占了。我们的任务是消灭进犯军的有生力量，等到一定的时机转入全面反攻，收复一切失地。我们各兵团打仗打得更好，这个时机就来得更快。
    等到把蒋介石侵犯军的有生力量消灭到一定程度时，蒋介石的悲惨下场将不可避免。由于兵心厌战，新的高树勋将军就会出现，由于后方空虚，人民反对，经济危机，蒋介石的后方会发生不稳。这时候，蒋介石自顾不暇，在我人民解放军的打击之下，决无办法长久保持他所占领的解放区城市。
    这就是为什么我们当着在情况不利时，决不死守一城一地（能够守的地方，则决不轻易放弃），而集中注意于歼灭蒋军有生力量的缘故。这就是为什么我们面前虽然还有困难，还有苦斗，而我们的胜利信心却日益增高的缘故。
    蒋介石的颓势已经显露，一切蒋军所到之处，已经是、而且将要成为蒋军的坟墓。蒋介石冒险进攻张家口或其他任何地方，只是加速其失败而已。坚定不移的把握歼灭蒋军有生力量的原则，把握歼灭战的作战原则，我们一定胜利，中国人民和民主力量一定胜利，是确切无疑的了。历史的铁则规定反动派必然失败，蒋介石和美国反动派是逃不了这一条的。只有到了那时候，中国人民与民主派才可能逼迫蒋介石实现今年一月的停战协定与政协决议。在蒋介石进犯军更大量的被歼灭，并逼使他实现一月停战协定及政协决议之前，蒋介石决不会放松消灭共产党与民主力量的，蒋介石的美国合作者也是如此。美蒋狼狈为奸，必然千方百计力求消灭共产党与民主力量，包括军事进攻及使用一切阴谋鬼计在内，以期达到他们反革命的目的。
    由于蒋军败象已经显露，蒋介石及其美国合作者现正开始玩弄新的把戏，以图欺骗人民，这个把戏就是放出“停战”空气。美蒋这一把戏的目的，显然是为了保持其在内战中所侵占的土地，以便再度获得机会补充兵力。蒋介石正在全国设立很多师管区，恢复征兵制，他忘想保持已侵占之地区，并在占领张家口等地之后，获一余裕时间补充新兵，以利再战。美蒋的反动计划是如此，打一阵谈一阵，再打一阵再谈一阵，再打……直至共产党与民主力量消灭干净而后已。好在美蒋这类阴谋现在已骗不了什么人，中国人民迫切需要和平，中共一天也不愿作战，可是欺骗是造不出和平的。美蒋消灭中共与民主力量的鬼计一天不放弃，进犯军一天不退出侵占区，一月停战协定与政协决议之实现一天无保障，中国人民解放军的自卫战即一天不能停止。恢复一月十三日停战令生效时的双方地界及兵力配置，并实行全部政协决议，这是中国人民的神圣权力。如果蒋介石真想和平，他就应当首先自动恢复一月停战协定的神圣位置。
