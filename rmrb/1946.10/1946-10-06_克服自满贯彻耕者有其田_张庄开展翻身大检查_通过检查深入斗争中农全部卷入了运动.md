　　【Report from this newspaper in Lucheng】 Zhang Village in the Fifth District was a typical village that had mobilized the masses last winter. Before launching the review of emancipation, district and village cadres believed that the feudal forces had been basically defeated, the masses had been basically mobilized, and the land problem had been basically solved. However, after cadres from eight districts concentrated their efforts and went directly to the most suffering masses for inspections, they realized that the masses in Zhang Village had not been fully mobilized, there were still many backward masses, and many problems remained unresolved. First, the feudal landlords not only did not bow their heads but were actively engaged in counterattacks. Zheng Lin-suo, a landlord, had a family member serving as a regimental deputy in the Kuomintang army. The chairman of the farmers' association, fearing a change of regime, dared not say that he was a landlord, but called him a wealthy middle peasant. The land he rented out was not returned to the masses. His family of three cultivated 64 mu of land, still living a parasitic life by exploiting the peasants. Wang Gui-jing was a feudal head who ruled the village. His daughter-in-law even put needles in the pots of ordinary people, attempting to kill the masses. Second, problems among the peasants had not been completely resolved, and poor peasants had not been thoroughly emancipated. Cadres found 34 problems during separate visits, including 11 problems among the peasants. During door-to-door registration, it was discovered that there were three poor peasant households in Zhang Village who had become poor because they had encroached on the land of middle peasants during the anti-traitor campaign, seven poor peasants who had not been emancipated, ten who had not been emancipated because they had been lackeys, and eight who were orphans and weak. The peasants received more than nine qing of land, but there was no tax collection, and many people felt that farming was not reliable, saying they didn't know who it would belong to in the future. Third, there was disunity between cadres and the masses, and there were disagreements. The government, the farmers' association, and the militia were working in three different directions. Cadres had a rigid work style and beat backward masses. Once, two group leaders of group meetings wanted to struggle against a middle peasant. The village head, fearing disruption, turned them away. Since then, the two groups stopped speaking at meetings and were dissatisfied with the village head. Among the masses, middle peasants and poor peasants were not united. Poor peasants believed that middle peasants were not firm and unreliable, while middle peasants believed that it was good to be poor, that poor people had an easy time, and the village head, Fang Yuan, said, "Poor people are models." Based on this situation, cadres were first educated to recognize the seriousness of the problems in the village and thoroughly examine their work style. They began to realize that their acting alone and substituting for the masses could not satisfy the masses, and that cadres should not arbitrarily scold ordinary people. The chairman of the armed forces committee and the village head both made self-criticisms at mass meetings. When the masses saw that the cadres had made self-criticisms, they boldly raised many opinions to them. Everyone's mood was very high, and more and more people were raising opinions, pouring out their hearts. Cadres reflected on their mistakes, and the masses also conducted self-criticism. Cadres and the masses were completely united.

　　Xi Rou, a middle peasant, had ancestors who were landlords three generations ago. His grandfather went bankrupt, and his father became a lackey for the wealthy, acting as an intermediary when the wealthy bought land, trying to give the poor a few less dollars. The masses had many problems with his father, mostly involving trivial sums of three or five dollars. Xi Rou was a volunteer teacher and was very depressed because he feared struggle. After the cadres learned about this, they first used mediation to solve the problem. Xi Rou was very happy, and other middle peasants were also happy when they saw this. They truly believed that the struggle would not reach them. So, they automatically solved their own problems on the one hand and got involved in the struggle on the other.

　　Ji Gou said, "I listened to the deception of the landlord Mei Sheng, and I deposited silver dollars with Mei Sheng. Now, I have even missed the chance to turn over." This aroused many people who had not turned over because of harboring [landlords] to complain. Everyone sympathized with them and distributed land to them. The peasants were united. Therefore, when struggling against the landlord Zheng Lin-suo, they were in high spirits, and their inquiries were sharp. Among the 30 people who raised opinions, 20 were middle peasants. People who had not spoken since last year also complained this time.

　　克服自满贯彻耕者有其田
    张庄开展翻身大检查
    通过检查深入斗争中农全部卷入了运动
    【本报潞城讯】张庄在五区是经过去冬发动群众的一般村，在开展翻身检查以前，区村干部都认为封建势力基本上打垮了，群众基本上发动起来了，土地问题已基本上解决了。但经八个区干部集中直接深入到最受痛苦的群众中去检查之后，知道张庄的群众还未充分发动起来，还有许多落后群众，遗留下的问题也很多。首先是封建地主不但没低头，而且积极活动进行反攻，地主郑林锁家有人在国民党军当团副，农会主席害怕变天，不敢说人家是个地主，说他是个富裕中农，出租的土地也没有给群众退租，家有三口人种的六十四亩地，仍过来是剥削农民的寄生虫生活。王贵景是统治一村的封建头子，他的儿媳妇竟把针下到老百姓锅里，企图杀害群众。其次是农民之间问题没有完全解决，贫苦群众还未彻底翻身，干部分头访问中发现了三十四件问题，其中有农民之间的问题十一件。在逐门登记中，又发现了张庄贫农中有因反奸中侵犯中农土地而变为贫农的三户，贫苦农民没有翻了身的七户，因当狗腿未翻身的十户，孤寡无力的八户，农民得到的九顷多土地，没有税收，许多人觉着种地不牢靠，说不来将来到底是谁的。再次是干部与群众之间不团结，闹意见，政权、农会、民兵是三股劲。干部作风生硬，打落后群众，有一次有两个组会小组要斗一个中农，村长怕斗乱阵营，把人家碰回去，自此以后两个小组开会就不张嘴，对村长不满意。群众之间中农和贫农不团结，贫农认为中农不坚决、不可靠，中农认为穷了就好，穷人吃的开，村长方元说：“穷人就模范。”依据这种情况首先教育干部，认识本村问题的严重性，并深入检查了作风，开始认识了自己包办、代替，并不能使群众满意，当了干部随意骂老百姓更不应该，武委会主任、村长都在群众大会上做了反省。群众看见干部做了反省，也大胆的给他们提了不少意见。大家情绪很高，提意见的群众越来越多，把心里的话都倒出来了，干部反省了错误，群众也进行自我批评，干部群众完全扭成一股劲了。
    中农喜肉家里三辈以前是地主，他爷破了产，他爹给老财当狗腿，老财买地他当中人，想法少给穷人几块钱，群众对他爹有许多问题，尽是些三块五块问题，喜肉是义务教员，怕斗争非常苦闷。干部知道后，先给他用调解办法，解决了问题，喜肉非常高兴，其他中农看见也都高兴了，才真正相信了斗争不会到自己头上，于是一面自动解决自己问题，一面卷入斗争。
    季狗说：“我听上地主美盛欺骗，我给美盛寄放现洋，到现在连翻身也误了。”这样又引起许多因包庇没有翻身的人都诉起苦来，大家因此同情他们又分给他们土地，农民团结起来了，因此斗争地主郑林锁时，情绪很高，追问说理也很尖锐，三十家提意见的人中，二十家中农，从去年以来没有发过言的人，这次也诉了苦。
