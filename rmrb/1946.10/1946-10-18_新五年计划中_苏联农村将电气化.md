　　New Five-Year Plan
    Soviet Countryside to be Electrified
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th] Moscow dispatch: Electricity production in the new Five-Year Plan will be equal to the total amount of electricity produced in the decades since the establishment of the first power station. Electricity supply will be particularly increased in Soviet Russia, accounting for 65 percent of the total increase in electricity throughout the Soviet Union. Power stations in the Urals and Gorky will be built on a particularly large scale. The Gorky power system, the largest new power station in the Soviet Union, will be built near Gorodets, and the total power in the area will be doubled compared to pre-war levels. The main construction work of the largest power station in Estonia has been completed. The restoration work of the Dnepr power station, one of the largest power stations in the Soviet Union, has been going on for two and a half years, and the water gate has now been completely repaired. In the new Five-Year Plan, 60,000 collective farms, all state farms, and machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union will be electrified, and 80,000 rural hydroelectric power stations will be established on riverbanks. Collective farms will also build 30,000 thermal power stations. More than 100 power stations have been opened in the Ukrainian countryside, and 80 collective farms and more than 30 machine tractor stations have obtained electricity. In the past seven months, 400 power plants have started construction in Ukraine, including 215 hydropower stations. The construction of 770 power stations will be completed by the end of this year.
