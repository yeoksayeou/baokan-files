　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Democratic National Construction Army Uprising
　　One year ago today, Commander-in-Chief Gao Shuxun raised the banner of righteousness in Handan, withdrew from the civil war, and dealt a serious blow to the fierce flames of the civil war at that time, cheering the people of the entire region. Over the past year, with the care and assistance of the people and the Communist Party in the liberated areas, the quality of the army has been continuously improved, and it has increasingly become an army of the people. These achievements have indelible historical significance. On this first anniversary, we would like to extend our cordial greetings and heartfelt congratulations to Commander-in-Chief Gao Shuxun and all the officers and soldiers of the army.
　　The past year has been a year of expanded civil war. The civil war forced upon the Chinese people by the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek and the United States plunged the Chinese nation, which had just emerged from the eight-year War of Resistance, back into the whirlpool of civil war. This civil war was opposed by the people of the whole country, and also by the majority of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang invading army. This is the social root of the uprising of the Democratic National Construction Army. Since the uprising of the Democratic National Construction Army, generals such as Hao Pengju, Pan Shuoduan, Kong Congzhou, Cao Youshen, and Hu Jingduo have successively revolted in various places over the past year. Air Force personnel include Captains Liu Shanben and Zhang Shouyi. Special agents include the Shandong Railway Transportation Brigade. Other uprisings involving a squad, a platoon, or fewer people occurred daily on all battlefields and are too numerous to mention. This uprising movement has added many difficulties to the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, disrupted their civil war plans, and weakened their civil war institutions, while it has been a major encouragement and help to the military and civilians in the liberated areas. This movement has played an important role in the Chinese people's struggle against betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship. The Democratic National Construction Army is the initiator and leader of this movement. Standing at the forefront of this movement, it has created experience and opened up a path for the development of this movement with its actual life over the past year, proving that the uprising of the invading army has a bright future.
　　One year of experience has proven that it is possible for an old-style army to become an army of the people, as long as there is determination, and it is not difficult to do so. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Coalition Government" that "transforming" the anti-people army "into an army of the people" is "an inescapable task." Calling on all officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army to rise up and restore Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition, the transformation work of the Democratic National Construction Army over the past year has precisely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction and restored Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition. After democratic reforms, ideological reviews, and grievance settlement, the relationship between officers and soldiers has been greatly improved. The appearance of the army has been completely renewed. The entire army has a democratic system. Regular meetings of soldiers and life review meetings are held. Every catering unit has an economic committee, and soldiers can express their opinions to officers on bulletin boards and at meetings. The soldiers' initiative in carrying out orders and obeying discipline has been improved. The entire army has done a good job in production. Commander-in-Chief Gao Shuxun said at a military conference: "You are all eating well and are chubby, with rosy cheeks, and are always smiling. I have been leading troops for decades, and I have only seen this today." The relationship between the military and the people has been even better. During this year's wheat harvest, all officers and soldiers of the army helped the masses harvest wheat, and Commander Qiao Mingli even got blisters on his hands. In the peasant emancipation movement, the troops actively supported the masses and helped them fight traitors and local bullies. The troops and the masses often held forums, listened to the opinions of the masses, reviewed each other, and strengthened unity. The masses' concern and love for the army has also greatly increased. They believe that: "In the past, our Northwest Army suffered a great loss because it had no political direction. Now we have a direction." This political direction is the political direction of the people's army serving the people. The above achievements have been obtained under this direction. The path taken by the Democratic National Construction Army is the path of transforming the old-style army and restoring Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition.
　　One year of experience has also proven that the uprising troops can cooperate closely and happily with the Communist Party in the liberated areas. Chairman Mao taught us that Communists only have the obligation to cooperate with non-Party members, and have no right to exclude them. This instruction is not only implemented in the "Three-thirds System" government, but also in the cooperation of various revolutionary armies. Commander-in-Chief Zhu pointed out in "On the Battlefield in the Liberated Areas" that "reactionary propagandists often claim that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army do not allow the existence of dissident armed forces. This is a lie." Over the past year, our cooperation with the Democratic National Construction Army has shattered these lies. The officers and soldiers of the Democratic National Construction Army are satisfied and happy with this cooperation. They feel that "the Northwest Army has been discriminated against by Chiang Kai-shek for 20 years, who tried every means to eliminate it. Now, our Communist friends are sincerely helping us develop, and we have a way out and a future." They feel that "the Kuomintang tells lies everywhere, and the Communist Party tells the truth everywhere." Commander-in-Chief Gao once said with great emotion: "I have been running around for half my life, and now I have finally found a home." These words are enough to express his feelings after cooperating with us. However, they also have a little dissatisfaction with us, that is: although the source of troops has been supplemented, "no cadres have been sent." We are completely different from Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek has continuously sent secret agents to monitor, divide, and destroy him in the past. Until recently, the Beiping Military Statistics Bureau also sent secret agents to assassinate him. We have no other intention for the Democratic National Construction Army except to help it transform, unite, and develop. "No cadres have been sent" is the reason for this. The Democratic National Construction Army has pointed out a path for how the invading army should cooperate closely with the Communist Party after the uprising with living facts.
　　The evolution of the domestic situation will further expand the uprising movement of the invading army, and the new national crisis is unprecedentedly serious. American imperialists have become the masters of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas in politics and economy, and the emperor of the Chiang family's evil government. The majority of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang invading army have increasingly understood this fact. Chen Shijie, a machine gun shooter from the Chen Cheng 11th Division who revolted on the front line of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Anhui border region, said: "Now the brothers in the Central Army are gradually recognizing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous face. Which Chinese with blood would be willing to die for the United States as a running dog?" After being tempered by the eight-year War of Resistance, and after the past year of American imperialism's invasion of China to turn China into the second Philippines, and Chiang Kai-shek's selling out of national interests in exchange for American help in fighting the civil war, it is not surprising that the majority of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang invading army have gradually recognized Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous face. With the continued progress of the civil war, the widespread development of guerrilla warfare by the masses in the liberated areas and the strengthening of the main force's resistance, the Chiang Kai-shek army on the front line will inevitably become increasingly passive, and the increase in casualties and the difficulty of supplies will become even more severe. In the rear of the Chiang Kai-shek army, people's livelihood is declining, the economy is bankrupt, and the peasant armed struggle will become more and more fierce. These will inevitably make the morale of the invading army even lower, creating an objective basis for a new uprising. The fact that the Democratic National Construction Army and other uprising troops are living happily and consolidating their development in the liberated areas will break through all reactionary propaganda and be understood by the majority of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army. The Democratic National Construction Army and other uprising troops will become the goal they aspire to in their pain and disappointment.
　　There are three main forces that destroy the civil war machine of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek and the United States: the heroic resistance of the military and civilians in the liberated areas; the rural armed struggle and urban democratic movement in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas; and the uprising movement of the invading army. In the past three months, the military and civilians in the liberated areas have eliminated 30 brigades of the Chiang Kai-shek army. The civil unrest in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas has spread to Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shaanxi provinces, and its prestige is immense, shaking the empty rear of the Chiang Kai-shek army. Compared with the above two, the uprising movement of the invading army still needs to be greatly strengthened. It should be understood that politically disintegrating the invaders, winning their uprising, and cooperating with us should be an extremely important part of the overall resistance.
　　The Democratic National Construction Army is a glorious banner of the uprising movement of the invading army. The vast number of officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army who are dissatisfied with betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship are watching him all the time. While celebrating the first anniversary of his uprising, may he be stronger and more developed, and go further. May the military and civilians in the liberated areas cooperate with him more closely and give him more care and help. May the uprising movement of the invading army become increasingly expanded, forming a torrent of waves, giving the civil war machine of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek and the United States a crushing blow.

### 祝民主建国军起义一周年

　　祝民主建国军起义一周年
    一年前的今日，高树勋总司令在邯郸高举义旗，退出内战，给当时内战凶焰以严重打击，全区人民鼓舞欢腾。一年以来，该军在解放区人民和共产党爱护帮助之下，不断提高部队的质量，已日益变成人民的军队。这些功绩都有不可磨灭的历史意义。当此一周年纪念日，我们谨向高树勋总司令及全军将士致亲切的慰问和衷心的祝贺。
    过去一年是内战扩大的一年。蒋美反动派强迫加在中国人民头上的内战，使刚刚走出八年抗战的中华民族，重新陷入内战的漩涡中。这个内战为全国人民所反对，也为国民党进犯军大多数官兵所反对。这就是民主建国军起义的社会根源。在民主建国军起义之后，一年以来，各地先后起义者有郝鹏举、潘朔端、孔从周、曹又参、胡景铎等将军。空军人员有刘善本，张受益等上尉。特工人员则有山东铁路交通大队等。其他一个班，一个排及人数较少的起义者，各战场每日皆有，不胜枚举。这个起义运动给蒋美反动派增加很多困难，破坏其内战计划，削弱其内战机构，而对于解放区军民，则是一种重大的鼓励和帮助。在中国人民反对卖国、内战和独裁的斗争中，这个运动起着重要作用。民主建国军正是这个运动的倡导者、带头者。它站在这个运动的最前列，一年以来又以实际生活，给这个运动的发展，创造了经验，开辟了道路，证明进犯军起义有光明的前途。
    一年的经验证明：旧型军队成为人民的军队是可能的，只要有决心，且不难办到。毛主席在《论联合政府》中指出，将反人民的军队“加以改造，变为人民的军队”是“一项责无旁贷的工作”。号召国民党军队中全体官兵起来，恢复孙中山先生的革命传统，民主建国军一年来的改造工作，正是实行了毛主席这个指示，恢复了孙中山先生的革命传统。他们经过民主改革，思想检讨，诉苦清算，官兵关系大加改善。部队的面貌焕然一新。全军有了民主制度。定期开军人大会和生活检讨会。每个伙食单位都有经济委员会，在壁报上和会议上战士可以向官长提意见。战士们执行命令，服从纪律的自动性提高了。全军生产搞得很好。高树勋总司令在军人大会上说：“你们都是吃得胖胖的，满面红光，都是笑的合不下嘴，所谓士气兴旺，我带兵几十年来，今天才算见到”。军民关系做得更好。今年麦收时，全军官兵帮助群众割麦，乔明理军长手都打起了血泡。在农民翻身运动中，部队积极为群众撑腰，帮助群众斗争汉奸恶霸。部队和群众经常开座谈会，倾听群众意见，互相检讨，加强团结。群众对该军的关心爱护也大大增加了。他们认为：“过去我们西北军没有政治方向吃了很大的亏，现在有了方向了”。这个政治方向，就是人民军队为人民服务的政治方向。上述成绩，就是在这个方向之下得到的。民主建国军所走的道路，就是旧型军队改造，并恢复孙中山革命传统的道路。
    一年的经验又证明：起义的部队是能够在解放区内和共产党亲密愉快合作的很好的。毛主席教导我们，共产党人只有与党外人士合作的义务，没有排斥他们的权利。这个指示，不仅贯彻在三三制政权中，而且也贯彻在各革命军队合作中。朱总司令在《论解放区战场》中指出，“反动宣传家每每宣传八路军、新四军不容许异己武装之存在，这是说谎。”一年来，我们和民主建国军的合作，粉碎这些谎话。民主建国军的将士们对于这一合作，感到满意和愉快。他们觉着“西北军二十年来，都受蒋介石的歧视，千方百计想消灭他。现在共产党的朋友们诚心诚意帮助我们发展，我们是有出路，有前途的”。他们感觉“国民党处处说假话，共产党处处说真话”。高总司令曾很感慨地说过：“奔走半生，现在才算找到了家”。这些话是足以表示他和我们合作以后的心情。但他们对我们也有一点不满足的地方，就是：兵源虽有补充，却“没有派什么干部来”。我们和蒋介石是完全不同的。蒋介石过去曾不断派特务去监视、分化、破坏他，直到最近，北平军统局还派了特务来谋害他。我们对于民主建国军除了帮助其改造，团结，发展以外，没有别的任何意图。“没有派什么干部”，其原因就在这里。进犯军起义以后如何和共产党亲密合作，民主建国军已用活生生的事实指出一条道路来了。
    国内形势的演变，将使进犯军起义运动更加扩大，民族新危机空前地严重了。美帝国主义者成了蒋管区政治经济的主宰及蒋家恶政府的太上皇。这个事实，国民党进犯军多数官兵已日益明了。在冀鲁豫前线举行战场起义的陈诚十一师机枪射手陈世杰说：“现在中央军里的弟兄们都逐渐认识蒋介石这副汉奸嘴脸了。那一个有血性的中国人还愿替美国当走狗送死呢？”受了八年抗战的锻炼，经过一年来美帝国主义侵略中国要把中国变成菲律滨第二、蒋介石出卖民族利益换取美国帮助打内战，国民党进犯军多数官兵已逐渐认出蒋介石的汉奸嘴脸，那是毫不足奇的。随着内战的继续进展，解放区群众游击战争的广泛开展和主力军抵抗的加强，前线蒋军必将日益陷于被动，伤亡的增加与补给的困难也要更加厉害。而蒋军后方民生凋敝，经济破产，农民武装斗争，均将愈趋愈烈。这些将必然使进犯军士气更加低落，造成新的起义的客观基础。民主建国军及其他起义部队在解放区愉快生活，巩固发展的事实，将冲破一切反动宣传而为多数国民党军队官兵所了解。民主建国军及其他起义部队将成为他们在痛苦和失望中所向往的目标。
    破坏蒋美反动派内战机器的有三种主要力量：解放区军民的英勇抵抗；蒋管区农村武装斗争及城市民主运动；进犯军的起义运动。三个月来解放区军民已经消灭了蒋军三十个旅。蒋管区的民变斗争蔓延川、湘、苏、浙、闽、粤、陕各省，声威浩大，震动了蒋军空虚的后方。与上述二者相较，进犯军起义运动还需要大大加强。须知在政治上瓦解进犯者，争取其起义，和我们合作，应为全面抵抗极其重要的一部分。
    民主建国军是进犯军起义运动的光辉旗帜。不满意卖国、内战与独裁的蒋军广大官兵是时刻在注视着他的。庆祝他的起义一周年时，愿他更加健强，更加发展，百尺竿头，更进一步。愿解放区军民和他更亲切地合作，给他更多的关心和帮助。愿进犯军起义的运动，日趋扩大，汇成一个波涛纵横的巨流，给予蒋美反动派的内战机器以粉碎的打击。
