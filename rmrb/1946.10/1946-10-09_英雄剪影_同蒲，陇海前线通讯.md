    ——Communications from the Tongpu and Longhai Frontlines
            Li Deming's Ingenious Enemy Killing
    On the night of September 7th, Comrade Li Deming, a communication soldier of the Third Battalion, went to Chen Village to deliver a letter. After completing his mission, he returned to Shen Village Fortress, but our troops had already moved. Unaware of this, he ran into the enemy upon entering the village. He resisted by firing his gun while retreating, but enemies were also behind him. Li Deming was seized by four men. As they were about to take his gun, one of the officers said, "Why take it? Let him carry it. What can a little 'local bandit' do?" The enemy asked him which unit he was from and how long he had been in the Eighth Route Army. Li Deming raised his voice and replied, "I am from the Eighth Route Army, only been here for a month and a half." Though he lost his freedom, he hated the enemy with gnashing teeth and struggled fiercely. The enemy threatened, "This little 'local bandit' is quite fierce!" Li Deming replied straightforwardly, "All Eighth Route Army soldiers are like this." This angered the officer, who shouted, "Only been here for a month and a half; if it were ten years, he'd be eating people." Thereupon, the enemies surrounded him, using gun butts, bayonets, and grenades to strike and beat his head, leaving him half-dead and covered in wounds. But Li Deming remained unyielding. At that moment, someone said, "Shoot him." Another said, "Stab him with a bayonet." Still another said, "Send him to the division headquarters to be buried alive." Suddenly, he heard the sound of bolts being pulled back. The three enemies holding him released him. Li Deming knew something was wrong. In a moment of quick thinking, taking advantage of the enemy's momentary lapse, he grabbed his gun and stabbed the enemy on his left in the face, piercing his neck. Another enemy came to seize the gun and engaged him in a bayonet fight, but Li Deming stabbed him down with force. The other enemies panicked and fired a few shots in a hurry, missing him. The downed enemy was about to struggle when Li Deming finished him off with another thrust. The enemies, seeing two of their own dead, were terrified and fled, cursing, "Damn it, we shouldn't have let him keep his gun!..." Li Deming chased them for seven or eight steps and then saw a dozen or so enemies approaching from about a hundred meters away. Thinking that he could not withstand so many people alone, he devised a plan. He retreated to a field of crops and shouted loudly, "First detachment, move quickly over there, there are still enemies in the village! Eighth detachment, keep up, don't let the enemy escape!" The enemies, unsure of the situation, believed him and fled in a panic. Afterward, Comrade Li Deming picked up the gun of the enemy he had killed, carrying two guns on his back, enduring a hundred pains, and victoriously returned to the unit.
            Zhang Falin Returns Loaded
    Zhang Falin is a stretcher squad leader in the First Company, liberated from the Pinghan Campaign last year. On the night of September 7th, our First Company pursued the enemy and encountered them in Shubao Village. The troops immediately charged forward, scattering the enemy. Zhang Falin and another soldier lost contact with the unit during this time, feeling very anxious, and not knowing where the unit had gone, they could only search blindly. In the process of searching, they encountered a large foreign horse belonging to the enemy. He led the horse and continued to look for the unit, but unexpectedly ran into more than a dozen scattered enemies who captured them. At the beginning, the enemy told them to walk in the middle. The foreign horse was a large target, and the enemy repeatedly told him to throw the horse away, but Zhang Falin refused. In casual conversation, one of the soldiers secretly told him, "Find a chance to run quickly, or you will die." He gradually became familiar with the enemy, and they slowly walked behind. When the enemy was not paying attention, Zhang Falin grabbed another soldier with one hand, and led the foreign horse with the other, and ran away with all his strength. After wandering around all night, they reached the entrance of ×× Village at dawn, and also loaded up more than a hundred water bottles left behind by the enemy, and also captured two prisoners, bringing the spoils of victory back to his original unit.
            He Wants to Carry a Machine Gun
    Su Yuefei is a soldier in the Ninth Company. In several battles, he thought: how glorious it would be to get an American-made machine gun to carry, but he could never get a machine gun. At the beginning of this Linfu battle, he wanted to leave the small artillery squad, because he couldn't charge in this squad. He asked the instructor to go to the rifle squad. At that time, because there were few people in the small artillery squad, and he was still a main force, the instructor did not agree to his request. He didn't express any dissatisfaction at the time, and still said with confidence: "As long as I have the determination, I can still get an American machine gun there." Coincidentally, one day, the company had a mission. This matter changed again in his mind. When the team was about to set off, he asked the company commander again. Even if he couldn't go to the rifle squad, he could have a rifle. Seeing that he asked again and again, the company commander agreed. As soon as the battle started, his eyes turned red, and he stared with both eyes to find a machine gun. At dusk, the company commander seized a machine gun from Jiang Jun. Seeing it, he said with red eyes: "The company commander has got it, and I can't get it yet." During the sixth charge, he and the company commander charged down. When they charged to a cliff, there were several people below. It was too dark to tell whether they were Jiang Jun, so they talked to Jiang Jun. Those people asked him, "Which company are you from?" He said very cleverly: "Second company, don't you see the Eighth Route Army above? What are you doing down there? Bring the machine gun over." Jiang Jun couldn't tell whether it was true or false, so he handed the machine gun to him in a panic. He took the gun and aimed at them and threw a grenade. He didn't hear it explode. Jiang Jun shouted a few times and was in a mess. He couldn't see them anymore.
            The Third Bomb
    When it was dark, almost midnight, Feng Jinbao's group followed the group in front of them, touched Guanque Village on the Linfu Highway, and stepped over the blockade ditch. It was quiet all the way. Feng Jinbao was a little strange, could it be that they ran away this time, his pace gradually slowed down. He touched a high earthen ridge, and walked very hard in the head. Feng Jinbao suddenly stopped, as if someone was talking in the earthen bunker, and clearly said: "Get up, get up." Feng Jinbao quickly waved his hand to the people behind him, and lay down on the spot. Someone was really saying: "This must be the Communist army..." Feng Jinbao had already figured it out. It turned out that there was a hidden bunker underneath. Feng Jinbao was busy looking for the gun hole, and threw a bomb into the gun hole, and a large piece of soil collapsed on the earthen ridge. The Jiang puppet army inside ran out desperately, and Feng Jinbao's people surrounded them, and disarmed them all at once. The people who were disarmed laughed, but the people who were disarmed looked sad and said: "General, spare me, spare me..." Feng Jinbao touched the village again in the head. Hu Zongnan's troops still wanted to use rocket launchers, but the two sides were too close to each other. Feng Jinbao rushed over with the bomb thrown, and after occupying a few eaves, Hu Zongnan's army couldn't hold on and retreated while fighting. At this moment, Feng Jinbao's chest seemed to be touched lightly by something. He didn't care, and didn't have time to pay attention to these problems. When he went back to get the bomb and threw it out, his chest hurt slightly. He touched it, and it was a small hole, and blood was flowing out. But Feng Jinbao threw the third bomb and took back a few houses...….

　　英雄剪影
    ——同蒲，陇海前线通讯
            李德明机谋杀敌
    九月七日夜晚，三大队通讯员李德明同志到陈庄送信，当完成任务后，回到申庄砦，我们部队已经转移了。但他还不知道，刚一进村正与敌人走了个对面，他就一边打枪抵抗，一边退却，岂知后边也有敌人，李德明便被四个家伙扭住，刚要下他的枪，其中有个当官的说：“下他干什么？还是叫他扛着，看他一个小土八路子，能会怎样？”敌人问他是那一部分，当了多少时候八路军等，李德明提高了嗓子回答：“我是八路军，才当一个半月。”他虽失去了自由，但对敌人仇恨得咬牙切齿，竭力挣扎，敌人威胁地说：“看这小土八路子还这样厉害呢！”李德明干脆的说：“八路军都是这样。”直把那个当官的气的大叫着：“才当了一个半月，要是十来年，就该吃人啦”。于是敌人都围着他，用枪托、刺刀、炸弹向他头上乱捶、乱打，把他打得七死八活，遍身是伤。但李德明还是坚忍不屈，这时有人说：“把他枪毙了。”有的说：“用刺刀挑了。”有的说：“送师部活埋。”一会儿听得有人哗啦拉开了枪栓，捉住他的三个敌人都离开了他，李德明知道不妙，情急智生，乘敌人松了一步，顺手取下枪来，向左面一个敌人劈面刺去，正刺在脖子上，另一个敌人前来夺枪，和他拚起刺刀来，被他用力刺倒，其他几个敌人慌慌张张打了几枪也未打中，被刺倒的敌人正要挣扎，却叫李德明再通了一刺刀，结束了这家伙的性命，那几个敌人见已死了二个，早已吓得魂飞魄散，拔腿逃去，嘴里还骂着：“妈的个×，不叫下枪！…………”李德明连追了七八步，又见百来米达前有十来个敌人赶来，他心想一个人抵不过这样多的人，就心生一计，退到一块庄稼地里高声喊叫：“一分队，快从那边过去，村里还有敌人。八分队，快跟上，不让敌人跑了。”敌人摸不清究竟，信以为真，吓的狼狈逃走。随后李德明同志又把被刺死的敌人的枪捡了起来，一个人背着两枝枪，忍着混身百痛，胜利的回到部队。
            张发林满载而归
    张发林是一中队担架班长，是去年平汉战役解放过来的，九月七日夜里，我一中队追击敌人，在术堡村与敌遭遇，部队就立刻猛冲过去，把敌人打得五零四散。张发林和另一个战士，在这时和部队失掉联络，心里着急的很，又不知部队去向，只有瞎找，在瞎找过程中遇到敌人一匹大洋马，他就把马牵上，又继续找部队，不料碰上被打散的十多个敌人，把他俩捉住。开始走的时候，敌人叫他俩走当中，洋马目标大，敌人又再三叫把洋马丢了，张发林总是不肯；在闲谈中，有一个士兵偷偷向他说：“你瞅空赶快跑，若不跑就要死的。”他和敌人渐渐混熟了，他俩就慢慢的走在后面，敌人一不注意，张发林一只手拉着另一个战士，一只手牵着那匹大洋马，一股劲的就跑开了。瞎转了一夜，天亮才走到××村口，又把敌人丢下的百多个水壶驮上，还捉住两个俘虏，带着胜利品，回到原部。
            他想扛一挺机枪
    苏岳飞是九连战士，在几次的战斗中，就想：搞一挺美造机枪扛扛是多么光荣的事情，但总得不到机枪。这次临浮战斗开始时，他就想离开小炮班，在这个班不能冲锋，他向指导员要求下步枪班，当时因小炮班人少，同时他还是个主力，指导员没有答应他的要求。当时他也没有表示不满，还是很有信心的讲：“只要自己有决心，在那里还闹不了一挺美国机枪。”可巧一天，连里有了任务，这一件事，在他脑子里又起了变化，当队伍刚要出发，他又向连长要求，那怕到不了步枪班，给他一支步枪也可以，连长见他再三要求，就允许了他。战斗一开始，他眼就红了，瞪着两只眼去寻找机枪。黄昏连长从蒋军手里夺了一挺机枪，他看见了眼红的说：“连长都搞上了，咱还闹不上”。当第六次冲锋时，他就和连长一直冲下去刚冲到一个崖头，下面有几个人，天黑了也辨不清是不是蒋军，就向蒋军答了话，那几个人问他，“你是几连？”他很机动的说：“二连，你看上边不是八路军吗？你们在底下干啥，把机枪拿过来”。蒋军也分不清是真是假，慌慌张张把机枪递给他，他接住枪就照准他们摔了一颗手榴弹，也没有听得炸，蒋军叫了几声，乱了一阵，再也看不见了。
            第三个炸弹
    天黑差不多半夜的时候，冯金宝这个组，跟着前面的一个组，摸到临浮公路上的官雀村，踏过封锁沟，一路上是静静的，冯金宝有些奇怪，这一回莫不是逃跑了，他的步子就渐渐慢了起来。他摸上一个高高的土堎，很费力的在头里走，冯金宝忽然站住了，像土壕里有人说话，明明白白地在说：“起来，起来。”冯金宝连忙给后面的人摆摆手，就地伏着，真有人在说：“这一定是共军…………”。冯金宝已经弄清楚了，原来这底下是个暗碉堡。冯金宝忙着找寻枪眼，从枪眼投进了一个炸弹，炸的土堎上的土崩下来一大块。里面的蒋伪军向外没命地跑，被冯金宝的人围上去，一下子都缴了枪。缴械的人笑了，可是被缴枪的人愁眉苦脸的说：“老总饶命，饶命………”。冯金宝又在头里摸进村子去，胡宗南部队还要使用火箭炮，可是两方对面太近了，冯金宝随着投出的炸弹冲了过去，占领了几间房檐后，胡宗南军队支持不住，且退且打，就在这时，冯金宝的胸口上，好像有东西轻轻的碰了一下，他不管，也没有时间留意这些问题。又回去拿上炸弹投出时，胸口微微发痛，摸了摸，是一个不大的窟窿，正在向外流着血，可是冯金宝又投出了第三个炸弹，又夺过来几间房子………。
