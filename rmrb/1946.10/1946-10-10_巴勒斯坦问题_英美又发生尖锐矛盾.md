　　Palestine Question
    Sharp Contradictions Emerge Again Between Britain and the US
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Reuters reported on the 4th that sharp contradictions have emerged again between Britain and the US regarding the Palestine question. Truman issued a statement yesterday demanding the immediate commencement of "supplementary immigration" to Palestine without waiting for the resolution of the entire Palestine question. He also expressed regret at the postponement of the Palestine conference to mid-December and stated that he could not support the plan of British Lord President of the Council Morrison (i.e., provincial autonomy), but he supported the proposal of the Jewish Agency, namely, to establish a Jewish state to manage its own immigration affairs. After Du's statement was issued, a British Foreign Office spokesman expressed "regret" that evening, saying that this statement might harm the negotiations that are underway. The spokesman told Reuters that Du's decision to issue the statement on the 4th was against the explicit wishes of Prime Minister Attlee.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Cairo, 5th: An editorial in the local "Middle East Public Opinion" magazine criticized the US policy in the Near East, saying that what guides the US Near East policy is not the intention to improve the lives of the people of various countries there, but the continuously growing greed of American capitalists, who are trying to obtain all real power and other privileges. At the same time, British and American airlines have begun a sharp competition in order to occupy Near East air routes and use airports.

　　巴勒斯坦问题
    英美又发生尖锐矛盾
    【新华社延安五日电】路透社四日讯：英美关于巴勒斯坦问题又发生尖锐矛盾。杜鲁门于昨日发表声明，要求立即开始进行对巴勒斯坦“补助移民”，而无须等待整个巴勒斯坦问题之解决。并对巴勒斯坦会议延至十二月中旬一事表示遗憾，且谓他不能支持英枢密大臣摩利逊的计划（即分省自治），但他支持犹太事务所的提议，即建立一犹太国，管理其本身移民事务。英外部发言人于杜氏声明发表后，当晚即对杜氏声明表示“遗憾”称：此项声明可能损害正在进行中的征集谈判，该发言人告路透社记者，杜氏四日发表声明的决定，乃针对艾德礼首相之明白希望而发。
    【新华社延安七日电】开罗五日讯：此间“中东公论”杂志社论，抨击美国在近东之政策称：引导美国近东政策的不是改善那里各国人民生活的意向，而是继续增长着的美国资本家的贪婪，这些资本家力图获得一切实权与其他特权。同时英美航空公司为了占据近东航空线与使用飞机场，已开始了尖锐的竞争。
