　　Taihang Mountains Suffer Frost Disaster
    Autumn Harvest Reduced in More Than Ten Counties
    Administrative Office Directs Organization of Sideline Production to Overcome Natural Disaster
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi, 30th] More than ten counties in the Taihang Mountains have suffered from frost, especially the highlands of central Shanxi. The autumn harvest has therefore been reduced. In the first ten days of this month, there was continuous autumn rain. On the 15th, the weather suddenly cleared, and a strong wind swept in from the northwest, passing through Ping順 in Shanxi and the northern part of Lin County in northern Henan. On the 16th, the temperature dropped sharply. Thin ice appeared in the highlands of central Shanxi, in Heshun and western Xiyang, and autumn frost covered the ground, affecting counties such as He(shun), Xi(yang), Zuo(quan), Yu(she), Wu(xiang), Ping(shun), Hu(guan), etc., and parts of mountain areas in counties such as Yu(ci), Tai(gu), Xing(tai), Sha(he), and Wu(an). Autumn crops that had not yet matured were completely killed by the frost. The disaster was most serious in central Shanxi and western Xiyang, with no harvest of naked oats and buckwheat at all. Late millet in the counties affected by frost was also affected. On both banks of the Zhuozhang River in the third district of Pingshun, the ripened millet looked as if it had been threshed, with only millet stalks swaying in the wind, and all the fruits were blown off. The average annual harvest in Pingshun County has been reduced by 30-40%. After receiving reports of the disaster from various counties, the Taihang Administrative Office immediately held a meeting to discuss the situation and issued urgent instructions to the affected counties, ordering them to immediately send personnel to express condolences and provide comfort, investigate the disaster situation, encourage the masses to fight against the natural disaster, and engage in organizing sideline production. It also pointed out the current emergency measures: (1) Intensify harvesting. (2) Organize the elderly, weak, women to sweep up the grain blown to the ground. (3) Launch the gathering of wild vegetables, storage of bran and vegetable and other substitute foods. (4) Expand the wheat planting area. (5) Call on the masses to economize.

　　太行山上风霜成灾
    十余县内秋收减成
    行署指示组织副业战胜天灾
    【本报长治三十日电】太行十余县风霜成灾，尤以晋中高地为烈。秋收因而减成，本月上旬秋雨连绵，十五日乍晴，巨风由西北方袭来，经山西平顺、豫北林县北部扫过。十六日气温陡降，晋中高地和顺、昔阳西部地区水蒙薄冰，秋霜遍地，波及和（顺）昔（阳）左（权）榆（社）武（乡）平（顺）壶（关）等县及榆（次）太（谷）邢（台）沙（河）武（安）等县部分山地，未及成熟之秋禾全被霜杀。晋中和昔西部被灾最严重，莜荞麦全无收成。降霜各县之晚谷，亦受影响。平顺三区浊漳河两岸已成熟之谷子，宛如上场打过，仅剩谷草随风摇幌，所有果实尽被吹落。平顺全县平均年成降低三、四成。太行行署接获各县灾情报告后，立即开会讨论，向被灾各县发出紧急指示，饬各县立即派员慰问安抚，调查灾情，鼓舞群众与天灾作斗争，从事组织副业生产。并指出目前之紧急措施：为：（一）加紧收割。（二）组织老弱妇女扫集吹落地中之粮食。（三）发动采野菜、储蓄糠菜等代食品。（四）扩大种麦面积。（五）号召群众节约。
